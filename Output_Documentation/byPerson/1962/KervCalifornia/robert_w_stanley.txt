mr.
robert
w.
stanley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court
and
counsel.
this
case
is
on
certiorari
to
the
district
court
of
appeal
for
california.
the
petitioners
were
convicted
of
possession
of
narcotics.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
entry
into
the
petitioners'
apartment,
their
home,
and
the
subsequent
seizure
of
the
narcotics,
the
evidence
upon
which
they
were
convicted,
over
their
objection
constitutes
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
in
violation
of
their
constitutional
rights
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
there
is
a
question
of
the
initial
arrest.
there's
a
conflict
in
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
the
evidence
on
that
point,
most
certainly.
i
think
it's
obvious
from
the
record
that
the
purpose
of
the
entry
of
the
police
officers
into
the
petitioner's
home
was
for
the
purpose
of
searching
the
home
in
an
attempt
to
find
the
narcotics
they
were
looking
for.
the
respondents
have
raised
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
at
the
time
that
the
case
was
tried
--
the
reason
this
question
arises,
at
the
time
the
case
was
tried,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
question
about
the
fact
that
the
theory
of
the
prosecution
was
at
the
entry
into
the
petitioners'
home
was
for
the
purpose
of
searching.
nothing,
unfortunately,
was
asked
of
the
police
offers
directly
what
their
motive
is
and
what
their
purpose
was
of
going
into
the
home,
but
the
only
logical
inference
that
could
--
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
their
conduct
is
that
they
went
into
the
home
for
the
purpose
of
searching.
and,
we
do
have
the
benefit
of
the
questions
of
the
prosecutor
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
for
example,
the
question
that
was
asked
of
the
arresting
officer
was,
“tell
us
in
sequence
and
detail
what
happened
after
you
entered
the
home?”
he
said
that
they've
got
the
key
to
the
door
from
the
manager
of
the
apartment.
this
took
15
to
20
minutes
because
the
manager
apparently
was
concerned
and
wanted
to
call
his
lawyer.
they
told
the
manager
that
they
were
going
into
the
apartment
because
they
thought
that
there
was
some
narcotics
in
the
apartment
and
they
wanted
the
key
so
that
they
wouldn't
have
to
break
the
door
down.
then
after
going
into
the
home,
after
entering
surreptitiously
without
any
announcement
of
their
arrival,
the
petitioner,
george
ker,
was
sitting
on
the
couch
and
he
stood
up.
now,
the
first
thing
that
they
said
to
him
i
think
is
also
indicative
in
sequence
and
detail,
exactly
as
the
thing
arose,
of
what
their
intention
was.
they
displayed
their
identification
to
him
and
said,
“we're
conducting
a
narcotics
investigation.
we're
sheriff's
narcotics
officers
and
we're
conducting
a
narcotics
investigation.”
well,
anyone
who
practices
criminal
law
in
the
los
angeles
county,
i'm
sure
knows
what
a
narcotics
investigation
was,
and
i'll
get
into
this
a
little
bit
later
because
i
think
one
of
the
arresting
officers
indicated
to
us
by
his
testimony
what
he
considered
an
investigation
was.
right
at
that
time,
the
petitioner,
diane
ker,
the
wife,
walked
from
the
kitchen
and
he
had
displayed
his
identification
to
her
and
said
the
same
thing.
then,
he
walked
over
to
the
kitchen.
now,
we
don't
know
how
far
he
walked.
we
do
know
from
his
testimony
--
from
the
officer's
testimony
that
it
was
a
large
living
room.
he
walked
over
to
the
kitchen
and,
standing
in
the
doorway,
he
was
able
to
observe
a
bricklike
brown
package
sitting
on
some
small
scales.
observing
this,
he
called
both
of
the
petitioners
into
the
kitchen
together
with
the
other
arresting
officer,
and
--
who
had
come
into
the
apartment
at
the
same
time,
and
he
questioned
them
about
it
and
he
asked
him
if
it
was
theirs.
he
asked
him
first
what
it
was
and
they
answered
they
didn't
know,
then
he
said,
“well,
it
appears
to
me
to
be
marijuana.
is
it
yours?”
there
was
no
answer
from
either
one
of
the
petitioners.
now,
the
question
that
was
next
asked
of
him
at
one
point
--
this
testimony
incidentally
was
gone
over
several
times
because
of
the
procedure
under
a
section
of
the
california
code
that
allows
this
question
to
be
raised
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
the
question
was
asked
at
one
time,
“and
what
did
you
then
do?”
and
the
answer
was,
“i
then
placed
the
defendants
under
arrest
for
suspicion
of
violation
of
the
state
narcotics
act.”
at
another
place,
the
question
was
asked,
“in
seeing
that
marijuana,
did
you
place
them
under
arrest?”
and
the
answer
was,
“yes.”
a
subsequent
search
was
then
conducted
of
other
parts
of
the
home
and
other
marijuana
was
found.the
next
day,
the
officers
--
one
of
the
officers
went
to
a
car
which
was
owned
by
one
of
the
petitioners
and
made
a
search
of
that
and
found
some
additional
marijuana.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
there's
no
evidence
that
they
did.
the
testimony
was
that
the
brick
package
of
marijuana
had
a
small
rip
in
it
and
the
inference,
apparently,
is
that
the
officer
was
able
to
see
the
green
leafy
substance
because
he
said
that
it
--
he
identified
it
as
green
leafy
substance
and
he
said
that
he'd
seen
it
before
and
it
appeared
to
be
marijuana.
where
he
was
at
the
time
that
he
did
this,
we
don't
know,
at
least
we
don't
know
from
the
record.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
the
information
was
for
possession
of
marijuana.
i
think
that
these
facts,
together
with
what
happened
immediately
preceding
the
arrest
and
also
what
happened
the
day
before,
indicate
that
the
purpose
of
going
into
the
apartment
was
to
conduct
a
narcotics
investigation.
they
didn't
know
that
there
was
any
narcotics
in
there
and
they
didn't
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
sufficient,
i
believe,
for
obtaining
a
search
warrant
to
search
the
home
on
the
grounds
that
there
--
that
narcotics
would
be
found
within
the
home.
in
fact,
one
of
the
officers
stated
that
they
had
no
direct
information
that
the
apartment
contained
any
narcotics.
what
did
happen,
however
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
it's
my
position,
mr.
justice
white,
that
our
case
would
not
be
essentially
different.
i
feel
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
based
upon
reason
that
despite
the
fact
that
officers
have
probable
cause
to
search
a
dwelling,
that
there
should
still
be
the
necessity
obtaining
--
of
obtaining
a
search
warrant
in
the
absence
of
some
dire
necessity.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
if
they
had
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest
under
state
law
and
they
complied
with
the
requirements
for
making
an
arrest
under
state
law
and
if
in
fact
the
search
were
a
search
incidental
to
a
lawful
arrest,
i
think
it
would
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
thats
correct.
our
case
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
entry
into
this
apartment
was
an
entry
for
the
purpose
of
searching,
although
the
officers
phrased
it
in
terms
of
conducting
a
narcotic
investigation.
they
let
us
know
what
an
investigation
meant.
in
fact,
on
page
111
of
the
record,
there's
this
language.
did
you
tell
diane
ker,
“now,
look
at
this”,
while
you
were
uncovering
something
or,
“i
want
you
to
watch
this?”
answer:
“i
made
the
statements
to
both
defendants
throughout
the
investigation.”
question:
“what
did
you
tell
them?”
“my
exact
words,
i
do
not
recall.”
“generally,
what
do
you
say?”
answer:
“watch
us
while
we're
looking
at
this
particular
spot
and
so
forth.
we
called
their
attention
to
it
and
if
they
don't
look
in
our
direction
when
we
are
checking
an
article,
we
reiterate
the
statement
and
do
not
continue
the
searching
until
they
are
watching
what
we
are
doing.”
searching
in
an
investigation
is
synonymous
with
police
officers.
what
other
type
of
an
investigation
would
they
be
conducting?
this
is
the
most
common
thing
that
a
lawyer
practicing
criminal
law
in
the
los
angeles
area
finds.
officers
will
come
up
to
a
person
and
generally
a
person
who
is
a
known
narcotic
user,
who
--
or
who
they've
just
seen
talking
to
a
known
narcotic
user
and
say,
“we're
conducting
a
narcotic
investigation.”
the
next
step
that
usually
happens
is
that
they
attempt
to
obtain
the
person's
consent.
and
--
well,
that's
not
involved
here
because
the
officer
at
the
same
time
walked
over
to
the
kitchen
and
saw
the
contraband.
it's
significant
in
determining
what
the
officer's
state
of
mind
was
and
what
they
intended
to
do
when
they
went
into
the
apartment.
also,
their
language
to
the
landlord,
they
didn't
say,
“we're
going
in
to
arrest
somebody”,
or
“you
have
a
man
there
who
we
suspect
of
having
bought
some
marijuana,
who
has
some
marijuana.”
they
said,
“we
believe
that
there's
marijuana
in
the
apartment
and
we're
going
in.”
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
i
don't
want
to
be
like
the
gravedigger
in
hamlet
but
in
this
type
of
a
case,
language
is
important
and
unfortunately,
when
we
find
ourselves
on
appeal
or
before
this
court
and
we
have
to
look
at
a
record
that
we
wish
were
more
complete.
i
think
that--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
think
the
record
is
complete
to
the
extent
necessary
to
determine
this
case.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan,
you
brought
up
an
issue
that
i
want
to
address
myself
to
and
that
is
the
events
that
happened
before
the
entry
into
the
apartment.
i
think
also
that
those
events
indicate
that
--
indicate
quite
clearly
that
the
purpose
of
going
into
the
apartment
was
an
investigative
purpose
to
see
if
there
was
some
marijuana
there.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
do.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
think
that's
very
significant.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
certainly
do.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
i
don't
feel
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
or
a
search.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
don't
feel
that
that
is
constitutionally
the
significant
factor,
although
i
think
it
is
has
evidentiary
value
and
i
think
that
inferences
can
be
drawn
from
it.
of
course,
at
the
far
ends
of
the
spectrum,
we
have
on
one
case
where
a
police
officer
may
make
an
arrest
two
or
three
hours
after
the
search
and
it's
hardly
--
that's
certainly
some
evidence
that
the
search
was
not
incident
to
the
arrest.
on
the
other
hand,
we
may
have
evidence
that
even
though
the
arrest
and
the
search
took
place
practically
at
the
same
time,
that
the
purpose
of
the
arrest
was
only
a
pretext
for
the
search,
or
else
that
the
real
purpose,
especially
where
a
dwelling
is
concerned,
of
going
into
it
was
to
search.
and
what
we're
really
concerned
with
is
whether
what
was
in
the
minds
of
the
police
officers
at
the
time
they
went
in.
this
case
is
similar
i
think,
to
the
case
of
united
states
versus
johnson
where
the
officers
smell
some
opium,
what
they
thought
was
opium,
burning
inside
of
the
home.
and
when
they
op
--
when
the
door
was
opened
for
them,
they
said,
“consider
yourself
under
arrest.
we're
going
to
search.”
this
court
held
that
the
real
purpose
of
going
into
the
apartment
was
to
search
and
that
the
arrest
was
only
a
pretext
for
the
search,
and
i
think
we
have
a
similar
situation
in
this
case.
now,
with
respect
to
the
events
that
happened
before
the
entry
into
the
apartment,
the
--
this
man,
murphy,
apparently
had
been
known
to
the
officers
for
some
time,
at
least
to
one
of
the
officers.
and
officer
berman,
who
was
one
of
the
arresting
officers,
had
received
information
over
a
period
of
time
from
anonymous
sources
or
from
sources
that
he
did
not
disclose,
claimed
a
privilege
from
disclosing
them,
concerning
murphy
in
which
ker's
name
had
come
up.
and
the
information
was
that
ker,
the
petitioner,
was
dealing
in
marijuana
and
he
had
probably
got
the
marijuana
from
murphy.
another
officer
had
made
a
buy
from
murphy
the
day
before
the
--
these
events
in
this
case
took
place.
the
following
day,
the
day
that
these
events
took
place,
these
officers
were
tailing
murphy.
they
were
following
him
and
they
lost
track
of
him,
so
they
went
up
to
the
--
to
a
sparsely
populated
place
in
los
angeles
on
fairfax
avenue
near
slauson
and
about
the
same
place
that
they
had
been
the
night
before.
they
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
there
so
that
they
could
see
for
some
distance
in
both
directions
and
they
noticed,
when
they
went
up
there,
the
car
that
the
petitioner
was
sitting
in,
it
wasn't
in
the
same
side
of
the
street
as
the
--
that
the
officer
had
purchased
the
marijuana
the
night
before
was
sitting
out.
it
was
on
the
south
side
of
the
street.
they
weren't
particularly
interested
in
ker.
they
did
note,
though,
that
he
was
sitting
there
and
that
there
weren't
any
other
cars
with
--
there
were
other
cars,
but
none
within
100ft,
i
think.
so,
they
eventually
saw
murphy
drive
by
and
when
he
drove
by,
they
attempted
to
tail
him
again.
he
turned
up
into
the
oil
fields
where
he
had
gone
the
preceding
day,
turned
his
lights
off,
and
they
lost
track
of
him.
they
went
back
and
parked
again
and
12
minutes
later,
approximately,
they
saw
him
coming
out
from
the
oil
fields
and
he
parked
behind
the
petitioner's
automobile.
they
saw
him
get
out
of
the
automobile
and
walked
up
to
the
side
of
ker's
car.
now,
there's
--
of
course,
there's
some
conflict
even
before
this
court,
on
that
issue
of
how
far
away
they
were
and
what
they
were
able
to
see.
they
were
watching
through
a
good
pair
of
binoculars.
they
were
probably
within
500
to
1000
feet.
that
seems
to
be
the
predominating
testimony,
although
one
officer
said
it
was
farther.
and,
i
think
we
can
infer
from
the
evidence
that
they
were
very
interested
in
murphy
and
in
what
he
was
going
to
do.
in
the
--
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
trial,
one
of
the
arresting
officers
said
that
it
was
either
light
or
it
was
extremely
well-lit.
he
could
see
very
well
and,
as
soon
as
the
--
they
were
able
incidentally
to
identify
ker
in
court
from
their
observations
at
a
distance,
a
brick
of
marijuana
is,
according
to
the
evidence,
is
about
the
size
of
a
brick
and
shape
of
a
brick.
and
as
soon
as
they
saw
murphy
drive
by,
they
immediately
followed
him.
they
immediately
pulled
up
and
drove
past,
and
when
they
drove
past,
they
saw
mr.
ker
sitting
in
the
automobile
and
he
was
half-facing
murphy.
he
was
standing
on
the
street
talking
with
him.
and
they
pulled
up
towards
slauson,
about
the
same
distance
away
as
they
had
been
before,
and
continued
to
observe
them
all
this
time.
the
period
of
time
that
elapsed
during
this
observation
was
approximately
two
minutes.
now,
a
question
was
asked
a
number
of
times,
“did
you
see
anything
passed
or
did
you
see
anything
in
his
hand?”
and
the
answer
was,
“no,
i
didn't.”
it's
true
and
it
was
pointed
out
by
respondent
at
one
point.
the
question
was
asked,
“could
you
see
anything
in
his
hand?”
and
the
answer
was,
“i
didn't
see
anything
in
his
hand.”
and
then,
after
it
was
repeated,
“well,
could
you?”
and
the
answer
was,
“well,
i
don't
believe
i
would
be
able
to
see
anything
in
his
hand
if
he
had
it”,
paraphrasing
it,
the
question,
“why
not?”
and
the
answer,
“well,
because
of
the
distance
and
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
extremely
light.”
the
fact
remains
that
nothing
was
seen
to
pass
at
that
time.
now,
i
think
the
subsequent
conduct
of
the
officers
after
that
event
took
place
can
illustrate
to
us
that
the
--
that
they
didn't
believe
that
he
had
any
contraband
in
his
possession
at
that
time
or
if
he
did
have
any
contraband,
if
they
thought
he
did,
they
weren't
interested
at
that
time
in
arresting
him.
they
had
pull
past
where
the
--
where
mr.
murphy
was
talking
with
ker
and
parked
in
a
parking
lot
about
the
same
distance
away.
this
was
towards
slauson.
now,
as
soon
as
the
conversation
ended,
they
appeared
to
be
talking,
the
two
of
them.
ker
drove
away.
he
drove
towards
slauson.
he
went
right
past
where
the
officers
were,
and
their
testimony
was
that
they
followed
him.
there
was
nothing
said
that
they
were
pursuing
him
or
attempting
to
catch
him
and
in
fact,
they
followed
him
quite
a
distance.
he
turned
left
on
slauson
and
went
all
the
way
down
to
la
brea
which
is
a
considerable
distance.
he
turned
left
on
la
brea
and
after
going
approximately
a
block,
he
made
a
u-turn
and
came
back
on
la
brea.
they
said
that
they
lost
him
at
that
time.
now,
i'm
sure
that
if
these
officers
were
interested
at
that
time
in
arresting
this
man,
that
was
their
purpose,
it
would've
been
an
easy
matter
to
arrest
him.
he
drove
right
past
them.
in
fact,
the
officer
--
one
of
the
officers
states
in
another
context
what
he
meant
by
“following.”
the
night
before,
they
were
following
murphy
and
they
lost
him
because
he
had
made
a
turn
also.
so,
the
question
was
asked,
“well,
were
you
pursuing
him?”
and
he
said,
“no,
we
were
following
him”,
to
that
effect,
for
the
purpose
of
tailing
him.
and,
i'm
sure
that
that's
what
they
were
doing
with
ker
also.
now,
these
officers,
at
that
time,
had
never
seen
ker
before.
they
didn't
know
anything
about
him.
all
they
know
is
that
he
had
talked
with
the
man
that
had
made
a
sale
of
marijuana
and
that
they
knew
something
about.
so
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
those
particular
officers.
that's
correct.
those
part
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
right.
another
officer
who
wasn't
there
at
the
time
had
received
information
from
anonymous
sources
or
from
sources
he
didn't
disclose
and
also
from
an
informant.
this
was
mr.
black
who
took
the
stand
incidentally
and
denied
that
he
had
given
them
that
information.
he
stated
that
he
had
received
information
from
mr.
black
that
--
about
ker's
narcotic
activities.
so,
the
officers
who
were
tailing
ker
didn't
know
anything
about
him
except
the
fact
that
he
had
talked
with
murphy.
then,
after
losing
him,
they
ran
a
department
of
motor
vehicle
check
and
found
out
what
his
name
was
and
what
the
address
that
the
automobile
was
registered
to
was
and
went
back
and
saw
deputy
berman
who
had
this
previous
information
about
the
petitioner.
and,
learning
about
the
previous
information
with
all
the
information
they
have,
they
then
went
out
to
his
home.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
no,
berman
was
not
his
superior.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
they
were
all
narcotic
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
they
were
all
narcotic
officers
of
equal
rank
and
if
one
of
them
had
charge
of
the
operation,
it's
not
disclosed
in
the
record
and
from
my
personal
knowledge,
i
don't
believe
that
narcotic
investigations
are
necessarily
run
in
los
angeles
with
someone
in
charge
of
a
particular
investigation.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
berman
told
the
other
officers
the
information
that
he
had
received
over
a
period
of
approximately
six
months
from
other
persons
concerning
ker.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
he
also
told
them
about
the
information
that
he
had
received
from
the
informant
black.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
there
were
two
sets
of
information.
we
can
phrase
it
that
way.
there
was
the
informa
--
yes,
the
only
information
was
possessed
by
berman.
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
from
black.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
yes,
but
that
was
also
pos
--
that
information
was
possessed
by
berman
also.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
from
november
until
may
--
in
november
1959
until
may
of
1960,
about
six
months.
he
had
--
in
the
course
of
his
work,
had
received
some
information
concerning
the
petitioner.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
besides
from
black.
the
information
he
received
from
black
was
from
may
of
1960
until
july
--
june
of
1960,
although
he
could
not
recall
when
he
had
received
it
or
when
the
most
recent
time
that
he
had
received
any
information
from
black
was.
armed
with--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
terrhagen
was
a
--
he
was
not
a
police
officer
or
an
undercover
officer.
his
part
in
the
picture
was
this.
the
undercover
officer,
one
by
the
name
of
cook,
had
been
introduced
to
terrhagen
by
a
confidential
informant.
the
officer
asked
terrhagen
if
he
could
purchase
some
marijuana
from
him.
terrhagen
then
put
--
was
the
man
who
took
the
undercover
officer
up
to
the
hills
and
that's
where
they
met
murphy.
and,
terrhagen
got
out
of
the
car
and
went
with
murphy
into
the
oilfields
and
came
back
with
a
block
of
marijuana
and
then,
terrhagen
and
the
officer
went
to
terrhagen's
home
and
a
sale
or
part
of
that
kilo
of
marijuana
was
made.
terrhagen
then
drops
out
of
the
picture.
the
officers
then
knowing
something
about
murphy
began
tailing
murphy.
and,
the
following
day
after
the
sale
was
made,
the
officers
began
the
surveillance
of
murphy
at
murphy's
home
and
when
they
lost
him
they
then
went
up
to
the
place
where
the
sale
had
been
made
the
night
before.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
terrhagen.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
the
officers
who
--
one
of
the
officers
who
tailed
murphy
that
evening
had
been
watching
the
narcotic
transaction
the
evening
before
from
a
distance,
and
had
also
received
information
from
the
undercover
officer
who
participated
in
the
sale
about
what
went
on.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
they
knew
that
or
they
had
reason
to
believe
that
murphy
was
the
one
who
obtained
the
narcotics
for
--
that
he
gave
to
terrhagen
and
terrhagen
in
turn
gave
to
the
undercover
officer.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
think
that's
a
very
fair
assumption,
although
the
man
who
introduced
the
undercover
officer
to
terrhagen
obviously
knew
that
he
was
a
confidential
informant.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i'm
quite
sure
that
he
didn't.
the
information
at
any
rate
was
exchanged
after
the
officers
lost
sight
of
the
ker
vehicle
and
they
went
out
to
the
home
of
the
kers
and
one
officer
went
around
underneath
the
window
because
--
for
the
purpose
of
catching
something
that
would
be
thrown
out
since
he
said
that
it
was
his
experience
that
often
times,
when
they
enter
apartments
that
the
occupants
will
attempt
to
dispose
of
the
narcotics
and
on
the
occasions
that
the
officer
--
these
officers
had
gone
into
apartments,
they
did
it
surreptitiously.
that
was
their
reason.
another
officer
was
sent
to
determine
if
somebody
was
home
and
mr.
warthen,
the
man
who
actually
saw
the
narcotics
in
the
kitchen,
went
around
and
checked
the
automobile
and
found
that
the
automobile
was
home
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
they
went
to
the
apartment
manager
and
said
they
were
going
in
and
wanted
the
keys
so
they
wouldn't
have
to
break
his
door
down.
the
--
i
think
that
--
i
think
one
of
the
crucial
things
here,
and
i
said
this
before,
is
the
purpose
of
the
officers
in
going
into
the
home.
i
think
it
can
be
--
to
dispose
of
this
problem,
i
think
that
it
can
be
--
i
think
it's
obvious
from
all
of
the
evidence
that
the
purpose
that
they
had
when
they
went
into
the
door
was
to
see
if
there
was
anything
there.
we
found,
for
the
first
time
before
this
court,
that
an
additional
item
of
testimony
that
of
the
defendant
below.
the
petitioner
here
was
introduced
in
the
respondent's
brief,
and
that
is
that
george
ker
said
that
when
the
officers
came
in,
they
immediately
handcuffed
him
and
placed
him
under
arrest.
one
of
them
went
into
the
kitchen
and
the
other
one
went
into
the
bedroom.
this,
of
course,
is
a
variance
with
the
statements
of
all
of
the
officers
and
i
think
that
when
we
have
evidence
like
that
from
a
person
whose
home
has
been
invaded
that
we
have
to
take
that
in
a
larger
sense,
he
wasn't
a
professional.
he
didn't
know
what
was
going
to
happen.
and
the
larger
sense
was
that
he
recalled
the
rather
traumatic
experience
of
someone
coming
and
walking
right
into
his
home.
he
recalled
being
handcuffed
and
taken
into
the
kitchen
and
that
what
he
purported
to
give
was
a
summary
of
the
transaction,
that
he
wasn't
aware
of
the
problems
that
we
have
here
in
the
sequence
of
events
and
their
importance
upon
a
determination
of
whether
the
entry
was
to
search
or
to
arrest.
now,
to
answer
mr.
justice
white's
question
now,
i
think
would
be
appropriate,
and
that
is
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
an
entry
into
a
home
to
arrest
and
one
to
search.
and
i
think
that
that
distinction
has
become
apparent
since
the
case
of
mapp
versus
ohio
in
state
court
proceedings.
in
one
instance,
we
have
a
direct
constitutional
question
involved
under
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
in
the
other,
we
have
a
constitutional
question
ins
--
in
what
i
consider
to
be
a
collateral
sense
because
a
search
incident
lawful
arrest
would
depend,
first,
upon
the
validity
of
the
arrest
which
is
something
that
is
not
a
constitutional
question
in
the
broad
sense
and
secondly,
upon
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
afterwards
that
--
and
whether
it's
really
incident
to
the
arrest.
i
think
in
both
of
these
cases
that
the
testimony
here
demonstrates
that
the
search
was
unreasonable.
first,
that
it
cannot
be
sustained
as
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest
because
the
primary
purpose
was
to
search.
and
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
feel
that
there
are
minimum
constitutional
rights
that
a
person
now
has
from
action
by
state
officer.
and
insofar
as
the
invasion
of
a
person's
home
is
concerned,
that
the
minimum
right
that
a
citizen
is
entitled
to
coincides
with
this
court's
decision
in
federal
cases
involving
the
entry
into
a
home.
in
other
cases,
it
may
vary
but,
in
the
case
that
we
have
before
us
i
think
that
--
i
think
they're
the
same.
i
feel
that
the
entry
into
a
person's
home
is
something
different
from
other
types
of
searches
and
other
types
of
arrest.
and,
i
feel
that
the
minimum
protection
a
person
should
have
before
an
entry
is
made
into
his
home
is
that
the
facts
possessed
by
the
police
should
be
presented
to
a
neutral
magistrate
for
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
probable
cause
exists
because
i
think
it's
been
demonstrated
and
i
feel
that
this
court
has
demonstrated
in
its
decisions
that
police
officers
in
a
zealous
pursuit
of
law
enforcement
sometimes
ignore
the
rights
of
individuals
and
that
their
actions
are
unreasonable.
and
that
--
when
we
present
this
to
a
magistrate
afterwards,
after
the
damage
has
been
done,
and
after
the
--
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
and
undoubtedly,
some
weight
being
given
to
the
fact
that
narcotics
or
other
contraband
was
actually
found,
that
there's
no
real
protection
at
all.
and
this
is
--
without
even
discussing
the
cases
where
narcotic
investigations
are
made,
that
is,
searches
a
person's
homes
where
they
find
nothing.
and
this
is
something
that
one
who
practices
criminal
law
cannot
ignore
because
they
see
it
all
the
time.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i'm
talking
only
about
the
constitutional
problem.
i
feel
that
in
--
i
feel
there
very
well
may
be
statutes
and
that
may
come
up
before
this
court.
but
i
think
that
so
far
as
the
constitutional
question
that's
involved
here
is
that,
first,
the
officers,
if
they
have
probable
cause,
must
show
that
--
what
they
have
to
a
neutral
magistrate
before
the
entry
into
a
person's
home.
now,
i
feel
also
--
i
don't
mean
to
limit
consideration
of
this
case
to
that
point
because
i
feel
that,
even
with
the
limiting
of
hindsight
looking
at
this
problem
that
there
wasn't
sufficient
probable
cause
in
the
minds
of
the
officers
to
warrant
a
search
of
the
petitioner's
house,
nor
was
there
sufficient
probable
cause
to
arrest
these
people.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
there
are
numerous
california
cases
involving
the
search
of
a
home
without
warrant
for
--
either
for
arrest
or
for
a
search.
and
the
california
cases
seems
to
be
that
it
seemed
to
hold
that
even
where
the
search
of
the
dwelling
is
made
some
time
after
the
--
or
rather,
the
arrest
was
made
some
time
after
the
search
and
it
can
still
be
sustained
as
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest.
and
i
think
the
interesting
thing
about
the
california
cases
is
that
there
is
no
case
to
my
knowledge
which
actually
draws
the
constitutional
distinction
between
an
arrest
and
a
search,
that
is,
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest
and
just
plain
search.
fortunately,
the
federal
cases
that
have
taken
up
this
problem
mainly
concerns
searches
of
unoccupied
places
as
without
any
prior
knowledge
of
who
might
be
in
the
house.
practically
all
of
the
california
cases
involving
the
search
of
dwellings
are
cases
which
--
in
which
the
police
officers
have
prior
information
concerning
the
persons
who
were
within
the
dwellings
as
opposed
to
just
information
of
what
might
be
contained
there.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
it's
quite
common
also
to
find
arrest
made
in
los
angeles
similar
to
the
agnello
decision
in
this
case
or
the
chapman
case
where
an
arrest
is
made
and
then
information
is
received
about
where
narcotics
came
from
and
then
the
police
would
go
over
to
that
location
and
then
search
that
place.
now,
this
is
quite
common
also
and
sustained
as
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
so
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
do,
and
that
is
my
position.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
--
yes,
i
do
feel
that
since
the
case
of
mapp
versus
ohio
that
california
is
under
a
constitutional
duty
to
apply
the
decisions
in
the
federal
cases
because
those
are
constitutional
decisions
and
this
is
now
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
well,
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
this
--
the
reason
i
limited
it
to
that
was
that
this
case
only
involves
a
search
of
a
home.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
feel
though
that
in
the
general
sense
which
is
not
before
the
court,
that
california
is
still
obligated
to
apply
the
federal
decisions
because
those
federal
decisions
now
delimit
the
question
of
what
a
person's
rights
are
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
what
is
an
unreasonable
search,
whether
it's
unreasonable
is
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
believe
so.
i
think
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i'm
sure
that
they
will
read
both
but
apparently,
the
position
of
the
second
district
court
in
this
case
was
that,
having
decided
the
case
as
they
did
that
mapp
versus
ohio
couldn't
possibly
make
any
difference
and
i
can't
agree
with
that
reasoning.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i'm
glad
you
brought
that
up,
mr.
justice
stewart
because
this
case
was
tried
before
mapp
versus
ohio
came
down.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
our
--
both
of
our
briefs
was
in
--
that
is
the
attorney
general's
brief,
as
well
as
the
petitioner's
brief,
was
in
before
mapp
versus
ohio
came
in.
then,
before
our
reply
brief
was
due,
the
decision
came
down
in
mapp
versus
ohio.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
yes,
and
we
got
permission
to
file
supplemental
briefs
on
that
point
and
in
our
and
then
in
the
attorney
general's
supplemental
brief
this
was
discussed.
the
court
disposed
of
the
point
by
saying
that
it
doesn't
matter.
i
think
it
can
be
taken
two
ways.
it
doesn't
matter
because
this
was
actually
an
arrest
and
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest.
or
it
doesn't
matter
because
california
is
not
bound
under
the
decision
of
mapp
versus
ohio
to
follow
the
federal
rule.
i
feel
that
in
either
case
the
second
appellate
district
court
was
wrong
and
those
are
the
grounds
that
i've
just
discussed.
now,
in
the
respondent's
brief,
their
position
appears
to
be
that
california
has
a
peculiar
narcotics
problem
and
because
of
this
peculiar
narcotics
problem
should
be
left
a
greater
latitude
or
degree
of
autonomy
in
deciding
these
questions.
and
i
feel
that
i'm
giving
them
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
there
by
saying
that
because
i
feel
that
what
they're
really
saying
is
that
this
isn't
a
constitutional
question
that
california
should
be
left
free
to
make
up
its
own
rules.
well,
i
think
california,
as
any
other
state
should
be
left
free
to
make
up
its
own
rules
only
if
they
do
not
violate
the
minimum
standards
of
constitutional
guarantees.
and,
those
minimum
standards
are
prescribed,
i
feel,
by
the
decisions
in
the
federal
cases.
it
may
be
that
this
court
will,
in
time,
make
those
decisions
different
and
make
the
rules
different.
but
at
the
present
time,
i
feel
that
california
is
bound
by
that.
of
course,
they
can
provide
higher
standards,
make
it
more
difficult
for
police
officers
to
break
into
a
person's
home
and
i
feel
that
the
course
of
history
has
been
whenever
we
make
it
more
difficult
for
police
officers
to
accomplish
a
given
end
and
with
the
object
of
protecting
a
person's
rights,
that
it
doesn't
--
as
contended
by
the
respondent,
it
doesn't
impair
the
administration
of
justice
or
police
efficiency.
it
makes
them
better
and
that
substantially
the
position
that
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
one
of
the
positions.
i
don't
feel
--
i
feel
that
factually,
the
search
was
not
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest,
that
the
arrest
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
--
was
a
pretext
for
the
search.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
the
district
court
in
california
analyzed
it
that
way,
that
it
was
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest
which
--
i
wasn't
sure
but
may
also
be
unreasonable,
although
i
don't
think
that
problem
is
particularly
involved
here.
i
think
that
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest
is
unreasonable
in
the
constitutional
sense
when
the
pretext
for
the
search
was
the
arrest
and
i
think
that
united
states
versus
johnson
is
a
clear
case
on
that
point.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
if
he
had
a
search
warrant?
if
the
officer
had
a
search
warrant,
i
don't
feel
that
we
would
be
here
because
a
point
--
there
wouldn't
be
a
point
to
be
made.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
personally
am
opposed
to
that.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
presently
any
constitutional
point.
i
feel
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
think
--
i
feel
that
the
surreptitious
entry
into
an
apartment
is
of
itself
a
constitutional
question.
i
--
the
reason
that
i
can't
argue
it
is
that
i
don't
feel
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
i
feel
that
a
search
warrant
--
a
warrant
to
search
someone's
apartment
or
someone's
home,
if
it's
lawfully
issued,
i
don't
see
too
much
of
a
point
in
the
fact
that
they
get
a
key
to
enter,
although
i
feel
that
they
should
knock
on
the
door.
i
think
that
for
an
arrest
the
same
is
true,
and
we
have
a
statute
to
that
effect
in
california,
but
the
statute
has
been
ignored
by
the
decisions
of
the
court
which
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
they've
construed
it
completely
away
by
saying,
even
though
the
statute
requires
it,
it's
not
necessary
because
in
narcotics
cases,
if
they
knock
at
the
door,
persons
are
likely
to
flush
the
stuff
down
the
toilet.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
yes,
i
feel
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
feel
that's
correct
because
i
think
that
if
those
--
if
that
had
happened,
that
the
arrest
would
have
been
simply
a
pretext
for
the
search.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
feel
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
well,
after
the
arrest
--
if
we
go
chronologically,
after
the
arrest
was
made
there
was
a
--
they
continued
searching
or
as
the
officer
said,
investigating.
they
went
into
the
bedroom
and
went
through
practically
everything
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
then
the
car,
the
next
day
--
well,
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
question
what
the
search
of
the
car
the
next
day
was
an
unreasonable
search,
although,
to
the
petitioners,
it
doesn't
make
too
much
difference
because
that's
just
additional
marijuana.
they're
going
to
--
so
far
as
they're
concerned,
if
they're
going
to
go
to
jail
for
the
marijuana
in
the
kitchen,
then
it
doesn't
matter
where
other
marijuana
might
have
been
found.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
yes,
i
feel
that
an
arrest
would've
been
illegal
at
that
time
because
those
officers
didn't
have
any
knowledge
about
ker
and
the
only
thing
that
they
had
seen
was
that
he
met
and
appeared
to
have
a
conversation
with
murphy.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
do.
i
feel
that
even
after
they
received
the
additional
information
that
they
still
didn't
have
sufficient
grounds
to
arrest
him
for
possession
of
marijuana,
and
i
think
that
that
becomes
even
stronger
and
takes
on
a
constitution
--
more
of
a
constitutional
dimension
when
they
go
into
his
home
for
the
purpose
of
finding
out
if
he
has
the
marijuana
and
if
he
does,
to
arrest
him.
i
don't
feel
that
there
would've
been
any
arrest
here
if
they
didn't
find
the
marijuana
there.
there's
nothing
to
indicate
after
he
made
the
u-turn
that
he
had
seen
them
or
that
he
was
attempting
to
get
away
or
he
was
going
fast
or
trying
to
dispose
of
something.
i
don't
feel
this
is
a
hot
pursuit
type
of
case
where
they
temporarily
lose
him
and
then
later
go
into
his
home.
i
think
that
what
it
is
that
they're
surveying
this
man
they
don't
know
anything
about
because
they'd
seen
him
talk
with
murphy.
perhaps,
at
that
time
in
their
mind,
they
may
have
thought
that
he
was
murphy's
contact
and
then,
after
getting
the
subsequent
in
--
they
don't
know
where
he
went,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
or
that
he
went
to
his
home
and
they
had
no
information
that
narcotics
were
likely
to
be
found
in
his
home.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
yes,
he
did.
he
met
across
the
street
and
i
would
imagine
the
officers
would
be
extremely
concerned
with
noting
what
they
were
doing
there
and
what
murphy
had
in
his
hands,
if
he
had
anything.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
this
is
like
persons
coming
from
the
home
of
a
known
seller
or
a
known
addict.
some
persons
may
be
selling
and
some
not,
but
the
fact
that
someone
talks
with
a
known
addict
is
--
i
don't
feel
is
probable
cause
that
he
has
received
anything
for
a
belief
that
either
one
of
them
have
exchanged
any
contraband.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
i
don't
believe
even
--
of
course
that
didn't
happen,
but
i
don't
believe
that
even
in
that
event
that
there
was
sufficient
probable
cause
for
an
arrest.
and
particularly
i
don't
feel
that
there
was
sufficient
probable
cause
to
go
to
the
man's
home
and
get
in
his
home
as
he
--
go
in
their
--
his
home
as
they
did
to
arrest
him.
hypothetically,
i
don't
feel
that
there
was
sufficient
probable
cause
to
arrest
him
on
the
street,
although
that's
not
the
question
that
we
have
here.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
oh,
i
don't
feel
there's
any
question
about
that.
that's
been
made
a
complete
dead
letter.
we
have
a
number--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
well,
it's
--
i
may
--
perhaps
my
statement
was
too
broad.
it's
been
excused
in
practically
every
narcotic
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
no,
we
have
--
i
believe
that
our
cases
hold
that
where
a
pers
--
when
they
hear
a
person
running
or
a
toilet
flushing
or
something
of
that
nature
that
that
constitutes
a
pretty
tight
conduct
which
itself
supplies
the
excuse
for
complying
with
the
statute.
we
have
case
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
no.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
a
different
circumstance,
but
we
have
cases
--
even
the
district
court
opinion
in
this
case,
i
think,
covers
this
point
quite
well
in
stating
that
where
a
police
--
we
raise
this
incidentally,
this
point
and
the
opinion
takes
care
of
it
by
saying
that
in
these
cases,
officers
feel
that
a
surreptitious
entry
is
necessary
and
because
of
that
reason,
they
don't
have
to
comply
with
the
statute.
now,
these
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
yes,
there'd
been
--
i
believe
there'd
been
a
number
of
decisions
on
this
point.
in
fact,
they
state
that
the
reason
is
that
the
rule
goes
back.
it's
--
the
statute
is
only
a
restatement
of
the
common
law
and
that,
because
of
this,
it
can
be
excused
by
circumstances.
and,
one
of
the
circumstances
happens
to
be
a
narcotic
case.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
only
wish
to
point
out
two
matters.
first,
with
respect
to
the
beginning
of
the
argument
for
the
respondent,
in
effect,
making
this
a
moot
question
before
the
court.
there
was
a
motion
made
at
the
very
beginning
of
this
case
when
it
was
tried,
much
like
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
at
page
16.
the
ruling
is
at
page
44
of
the
transcript
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page
and
incidentally,
it's
true
that
the
--
that
exhibits
2
and
3
were
not
specifically
discussed.
however,
the
ruling
came
right
in
the
middle
of
the
testimony
and
a
reading
of
the
--
of
this
probable
cause
hearing
will
disclose
that
the
judge
was
rushing
it
along
all
the
way
through.
and
he
said
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
after
he
discussed
--
that
he
didn't
think
that
mr.
black's
testimony
would
have
much
significance,
so
far
as
the
defendant's
preparing
the
case
is
concerned.
he
says
(inaudible),
“i
think
i
have
listened
very
patiently
to
this
testimony
and
the
court
rules
that
there
is
sufficient
probable
cause
to
proceed
in
this
action”,
and
that
was
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that
was
based
upon
his
listening
to
evidence.
on
page
16,
the
motion
was
first
made.
apparently,
the
court
was
apprised
either
outside
of
the
record
or
--
it's
not
disclosed
in
the
record
of
what
the
nature
of
the
motion
was.
page
16,
however,
the
defense
counsel
stated,
“well,
for
the
purpose
of
the
record,
then
i
move
that
the
probable
cause
hearing
be
conducted
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.”
then,
they
proceeded
to
litigate
that
issue,
and
the
prosecutor
at
that
time
stated,
“if
the
court
wishes,
i'd
place
my
officers
on
the
stand
to
show
there
was
probable
cause.”
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
they
were
put
on
the
stand
at
that
time
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
between
pages
16
and
pages
45.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
yes,
all
of
that
testimony
is
in
there.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
this
is
much
like
a
motion
to
suppress.
it
concerns
the
probable
cause
and
i
think
the
more
reasonable
assumption
is
that
--
well,
it's
not
stated
whether
probable
cause
was
with
relation
to
arrest
or
the
search
or
both,
that
it
was
made
with
respect
to
all
of
the
evidence
and
not
any
particular
one
item
of
evidence
before
the
court.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
correct.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
and
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
when
the
exhibits
were
offered,
having
already
--
the
court,
already
having
ruled
upon
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
it
was
going
to
receive
them,
i
don't
think
it
was
at
that
time
incumbent
upon
the
defense
counsel
not
to
object.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
should
give
any
effect
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
don't
feel
that
the
probable
cause
hearing
was
sufficiently
definite
as
to
what
the
court
was
determining.
i
think
it's
obvious
from
reading
it
that
it
wasn't
explicit
as
to
whether
they
were
discussing
an
arrest
or
a
search
or
both
and
he
found
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
proceed,
and
then
followed
that
by
stating,
“if
there's
any
injustice
being
done,
i
can
always
dismiss
the
information.”
and--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
did
not
try
this
case.
no,
i
didn't.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
no,
he
did
not.
he
just
stated
very
well.
it
was
at
the
conclusion
of
the
day
and
the
following
day,
the
jury
trial
began.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
he
ruled
that
the
evidence
was
admissible,
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
and
that
it
should
not
be
suppressed.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
the
defense
counsel
did
not
make
any
further
objection
as
the
evidence
was
introduced
during
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
correct.
in
fact,
the
exhibits
were
not
even
marked
for
identification
at
the
time
of
the
probable
cause
hearing.
they
weren't
marked
until
the
beginning
of
the
trial
when
the
chemist
was
warned.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
law.
i
don't
believe
that
after
--
the
reason
this
is
difficult
to
answer
is
because
normally,
these
995
motions
are
made
some
time
before
the
trial
but
usually
made
before
a
plea
has
been
entered.
and
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
an
objection
is
generally
renewed,
although
it's
not
argued
again.
in
this
case,
for
some
reason,
it
was
made
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
i
think
that's
one
of
the
issues.
the
other
is
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
the
apartment
or
whether
the
search
was
unreasonable
--
mr.
robert
w.
stanley
whether
the
search
was
a
reasonable
search
under
the
federal
rules.
