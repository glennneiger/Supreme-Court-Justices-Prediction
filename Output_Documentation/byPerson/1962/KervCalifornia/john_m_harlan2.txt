(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
arguing
this
case,
at
least
as
i
understand
you
correctly,
as
if
it
were
a
federal
case.
is
it
your
view
that
we're
to
judge
this
search
and
seizure
in
terms
of
federal
standards?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
--
what
you're
saying
wouldn't
even
be
so
in
a
federal
case
because
we
have
federal
statutes
that
--
like
your
california
statute,
generally
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
authorizes
narcotic
agents
to
search
without
a
warrant
on
a
probable
clause.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean,
to
arrest
without
a
warrant.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
do?
then
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
said
you
thought
that
in
relation
to
the
search
of
the
home
that
ordered
liberty
or
due
process
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
required
federal
standards,
but
i
didn't
understand
you
to
say
what
you're
saying
now.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
in
other
words,
to
put
it
concretely,
your
police
schools,
your
police
training
officers,
instead
of
reading
california
decisions,
now
ought
to
read
federal
decisions.
