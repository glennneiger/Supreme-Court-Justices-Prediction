chief

earl
warren
george
d.
ker
et
al.,
petitioners,
versus
california.
mr.
stanley.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
you
want
to
reserve
a
little
of
your
time.
so,
you
may
have
five
minutes
at
the
end
to
rebut
if
you
wish,
mr.
stanley.
mr.
--
and,
you
may
have
five
minutes
more
if
you
wish,
too,
mr.
ringer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
now
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
the
search
of
the
bedroom
on
a
different
occasion
than
the
--
than
finding
the
brick?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
did
litigate
the
question
of
the
brick.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
every
time
they
opened
a
drawer
or
go
into
another
room
after
the
first
search
has
been
litigated,
must
they
object
to
every
question
along
those
lines?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
think
mr.
stanley
was
particularly
interested
in
whether
the
search
was
just
in
the
kitchen
or
whether
it
was
in
the
kitchen
and
the
bedroom.
he
was
concerned
with
whether
the
search,
as
a
whole,
was
a
reasonable
search.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
you
--
i
thought
you
said
it
wasn't
here
(inaudible)
--
wasn't
here?
i
--
that's
the
thing
that
bothered
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
only
distinction
between
1,
2,
and
3?
chief
justice
earl
warren
also
make
this
same
argument
about
the
brick?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
only
distinction
so
far
as
we're
concerned,
as
i
understand
you
is,
in
this
court,
is
that,
in
one
instance,
that
of
the
brick,
he
raised
it
below
and
in
the
case
of
the
bedroom
and
the
other
room,
he
didn't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
is
that
the
only
distinction
between
the
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
far
in
point
of
time
were
these
separated?
that
is
the
finding
of
the
brick
and
the
finding
of
the
other
marijuana
in
the
bedroom.
chief
justice
earl
warren
immediately?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
will
we
find
in
the
record
the
question
that
was
raised
by
the
defendant
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
and
the
decision
against
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
ringer,
you
referred
us
to
page
43
where
the
judge
says,
“well,
mr.
(inaudible),
what
is
your
theory
why
there
is
no
probable
cause
here?”
now,
that
infers
if
there
has
been
--
that
question
has
been
raised
before,
but
it
isn't
raised
on
this
page.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
was
it
first
raised?
so
we
can
see
what
the
scope
of
the
objection
of
the
defendant
was.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ringer,
bearing
on
the
question
on
whether
they
could've
gotten
the
warrant,
when
did
the
police
learn
from
berman
these
facts
about
ker?
what
time
of
the
day
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
since
1933?
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
law
journal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
duke?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
stanley,
you
may
proceed.

justice
