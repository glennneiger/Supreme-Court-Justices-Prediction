probable
cause
to
get
a
search
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
could
they
have
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
weren't
there
anonymous
sources
that
he
had?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
besides
black.
justice
byron
r.
white
help
me
out
a
little
here.
assuming
that
the
officer
here
had
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
the
federal
cases,
you
don't
now
sustain
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
courts
have
construed
the
limitation
away.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
officer
had
had
a
search
warrant
then
--
and
entered
the
apartment
any
--
in
this
way
or
some
other
way,
even
in
conformity
with
this
--
with
the
california
statute.
i
take
it
your
argument
still
is
that
even
if
he
had
an
arrest
warrant
and
entered
validly,
that
the
search
that
was
conducted
was
not
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
even
if
he
had
arrested
him
first,
walked
right
in
the
door
and
had
arrested
him,
the
accompanying
search
was
not
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
make
the
point
that
the
scope
of
the
search
was
unreasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
just
looking
in
the
kitchen
was
not
--
you
don't
say
would
be
--
is
an
unreasonable
search
incident
to
an
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
was
the
car.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
they
--
even
when
they
acquired
further
information
from
berman,
if
they
had,
after
that,
arrested
ker
on
the
street,
you
would
say
the
arrest
would've
been
illegal.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
say
that
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
wouldn't
excuse
if
entering
with
a
key
without
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
knowing
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that's
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
we
can't
find
it
on
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
did
that
distinguish
between
1,
2,
and
3?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
you
--
do
you
agree
that
its
objective
on
the
--
number
one,
let's
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
--
that's
your
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
the
matter
was
litigated
and
then
number
2
and
3,
wasn't
litigated.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you're
really
arguing
is
that,
here,
the
first
one
is
being
convicted
and
--
for
marijuana
events
and
two
items
--
(inaudible)
items
as
evidence
was
introduced.
one
was
obtained
illegally
and
the
other
was
obtained
legally.
one
was
obtained
illegally
and
one
was
obtained
legally,
but
both
were
introduced.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
do
you
think
that
that's
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know,
and
i
agree
that
--
i
agree
that
you
say
that
one
of
them
was
--
that
they
were
both
legally
obtained.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least,
you
would
say
that
one
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
aren't
you
--
you're
arguing
that
--
aren't
you
also
arguing,
i
take
it,
(inaudible)
even
if
he
had
objections
on
2
and
3,
the
objections
are
not
(inaudible)
because
that
that
search
follows
an
arrest
and
was
lawfully
incident
to
an
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
consequently,
you're
back
again
to
having
--
at
the
most,
one
illegal
piece
of
contraband
and
(inaudible)
and
2
legal
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
a
valid
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
can't
--
i
mean,
at
the
search,
you
can't
defend
this,
can
you,
without
connecting
it
with
an
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
that
every
time
the
exception
is
relied
upon,
every
time
someone
gets
a
key
to
get
into
an
apartment,
it
only
underlines
the
fact
that
(inaudible)
going
to
see
is
narcotics,
then
they
wouldn't
arrest
the
man
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
underlines
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
--
i
don't
suppose
if
they
had
(inaudible)
--
if
they
had
known
ker
--
if
they
had
thought
that
ker
had
disposed
of
the
narcotics,
if
they
thought
he
had
obtained
from
murphy
before
he
got
to
his
apartment,
i
doubt
that
they
would
have
entered
and
arrested
him
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
have
no
--
because
they
would
have
some
difficulty,
i
would
assume,
and
they
getting
a
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
arrest
the
fellow,
then
or
the
next
day
or
something
else
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
overwriting
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
an
overwriting
consideration
as
to
a
different
narcotic.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
whole
basis
for
creating
an
exception
under
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
seem
this
is
the
whole
basis
for
creating
the
exception
in
the
service
of
--
in
the
arrest
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
--
was
simon?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
show
that
there
was
probable
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
--
in
a
constitutional
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
tell
me
if
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
just
tell
me
if
your
statute
on
executing
a
search
warrant
is
similar
to
your
arrest
warrant
statutes.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you're
going
to
execute
a
search
and
take
somebody's
home
and
the
object
of
your
search
is
the
narcotics
(inaudible)
the
court
(inaudible)
the
key
in
entering
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
if
no
one's
home,
i
suppose,
in
executing
a
search
warrant,
you
can
go
in
to
search.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
but
if
someone's
home
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
someone
is
home,
so
far,
the
courts
really
haven't
defined
the
scope
of
how
the
searcher
may
enter.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
wondered
whether
it
has
been
made
clear
under
california
law
or
in
the
cases
as
yet
whether
in
executing
a
search
warrant,
officers
are
permitted
to
enter
as
they
did
here
when
people
are
at
home.
