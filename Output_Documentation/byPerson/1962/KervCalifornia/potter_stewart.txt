now,
california
has
had
the
so-called
exclusionary
rule,
what
--
for
what,
seven
years
and
so?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
case
was
in
1955.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
i
think
you're
right
from
the
beginning
in
that
case
you're
certainly
in
a
--
right
from
the
start,
the
california
supreme
court
announced
that
it
was
not
going
to
either
purport
or
to
follow
the
federal
rule
as
to
what
was
and
was
not
unreasonable.
justice
potter
stewart
among
other
things,
they
correctly
said
the
rule
was
a
difficult
concern
in
the
welfare
of
cases
in
this
court
that
they
were
going
to
work
out
their
own
standards,
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
any
other
california
cases
similar
to
this
one,
involving
the
search
of
a
home
and
an
arrest
in
a
home
without
either
a
search
warrant
or
an
arrest
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
now
--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
before
you
proceed,
if
i
can
just
(inaudible)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
interrupt
you,
so
i
won't
interrupt
you
again,
at
least
for
a
while.
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan.
is
it
or
is
it
not
your
contention
that
at
least
since
the
mapp
case,
mapp
against
ohio,
california
is
under
a
constitutional
duty
to
apply
the
general
rules
which
have
been
worked
out
--
general
standards
which
have
been
worked
out
by
this
court
under
the
fourth
amendment
as
to
what
is
and
is
not
an
unreasonable
search
or
seizure?
justice
potter
stewart
does
not
involve
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
statutes,
of
course,
it
involves
--
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
this
case
decided
in
a
chronological
reference
to
the
mapp
case?
justice
potter
stewart
your
reply
brief
in
the
district
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
ringer,
you
have
indicated
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
difficulty
because
of
the
size
of
los
angeles
county
and
the
unavailability
of
the
appropriate
magistrates.
the
difficulty
in
warrants,
either
arrest
warrants
or
search
warrants.
are
there
any
figures
available
as
to
how
many
--
in
how
many
cases
of
arrests
are
made
with
warrants
and
how
many
without
warrants
in
that
county,
and
same
as
to
searches?
justice
potter
stewart
500
or
600.
justice
potter
stewart
over
a
30
--
justice
potter
stewart
almost
a
30-year
period.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
undoubtedly
were
thousands,
literally
thousands
and
thousands
of
searches.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course,
your
law,
your
case
law,
and
your
statutory
law,
up
until
1955,
are
now
directing
various
search
warrants.
you
had
the
non-exclusionary
rules
so
there
was
no
incentive
at
all
to
get
a
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
in
your
compendium?
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
spell
keener?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
the
california
policy.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
as
the
evidence
was
introduced,
you
did
not
make
any
further
objection
but
are
you
rather
--
the
defense
counsel
did
not
make
any
further
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
there'd
already
been
a
ruling
and
he
had
presumably
saved
these
exceptions
to
