mr.
gordon
ringer
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
ringer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
honorable
court.
before
proceeding
any
further
with
the
argument
for
respondent
in
this
case,
i
would
wish,
if
i
may,
to
delimit
the
issues
perhaps
a
more
restrictive
manner
than
mr.
stanley
has
delimited
them.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
has
faced
under
footnote
9
of
the
mapp
decision
with
any
problem
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
of
the
bedroom
in
which
a
half-ounce
of
marijuana
was
obtained,
the
search
of
the
kitchen
cupboard
which
succeeded
the
arrest,
and
the
subsequent
search
the
following
day
of
the
car
belonging
to
the
petitioner,
diane
ker.
it
has
been
the
law
of
california
since
the
inception
of
the
cahan
decision.
the
citation
on
that
is
the
kitchen's
case
in
46
cal.2d.
all
the
cases
incidentally
which
i
will
mention
in
argument
are
compendiously
contained
in
our
summary
of
the
california
cases
at
the
close
of
our
brief.
but
to
repeat,
it
has
been
the
law
of
california
since
the
cahan
decision
that
unless
an
objection
is
made
at
the
trial
to
the
introduction
of
evidence
whose
providence
is
contended
to
be
illegal,
such
a
point
may
not
be
asserted
upon
the
appeal.
turning
to
the
record
in
this
case,
we
concede
for
the
purpose
--
at
least
for
the
purpose
of
review
by
certiorari
that
objections
were
properly
made
for
the
purpose
at
least
to
preserving
the
point
here
as
to
the
kilo-brick
of
marijuana
in
the
kitchen.
that
case
--
that
was
litigated
at
the
trial.
as
to
the
question
of
the
search
of
the
bedroom,
the
search
of
the
kitchen
cupboard,
and
the
car,
it
was
specifically
stated
by
mr.
(inaudible)
at
the
trial,
page
68
of
the
record,
there
was
no
objection
to
the
introduction
in
evidence
of
these
matters.
there
was
no
litigation
as
to
the
reasonableness
or
unreasonableness
of
the
search
which
produced
these
items
and
that
question
isn't
properly
here.
now
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
it
almost
immediately
followed,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
at
the
probable
cause
hearing.
there's
no
question
that
was
litigated.
mr.
gordon
ringer
oh,
i
see
your
honor's
point.
but
the
point
is,
assuming
that
i
will
assume
arguendo
the
correctness
of
my
position
up
to
this
point,
namely
that
the
officers
had
probable
cause
for
an
arrest,
namely
that
the
entry
of
the
apartment
was
legal.
if
my
position
is
sound
on
these
points,
the
only
conceivable
objection
which
they
could
have
to
the
introduction
of
this
other
contraband
is
that
it
was
produced
by
a
skirt
--
by
a
search
party
which
in
scope,
extent,
an
area
was
not
justified
by
the
fact
that
it
was
incident
to
an
arrest
based
upon
probable
cause.
that
raises
other
issues.
that's
a
question
of
scope
under
harris,
rabinowitz,
and
the
other
cases
which
apply
that
rule.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
just
want
to
nail
the
point
down,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
ringer
well,
i
don't
think
it
is,
your
honor,
but
i
--
though
i
say
that
with
the
reservation
in
mind
that
mr.
stanley
is
not
particularly
relying
upon
it,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
question
is
here.
mr.
gordon
ringer
68
--
pardon
me,
your
honor,
68.
i'll
speak
more
directly
into
the
microphone.
mr.
gordon
ringer
you
can't
find
--
oh,
top
of
the
page,
68
of
the
record.
mr.
corn:
“your
honor,
i
ask
that
the
evidence,
peoples
1,
2,
and
3
for
identification
and
their
contents
be
received
into
evidence.”
the
court:
“any
objections?”
mr.
(inaudible)
:
“no
objections.”
the
court:
“it
may
be
received.”
then,
the
people
rest.
mr.
gordon
ringer
one
was
the
kilo-brick,
two
(inaudible)
--
the
kilo
was
2.2
lbs
of
marijuana
package.
two,
a
half-ounce
of
marijuana
found
in
the
kitchen
cupboard.
two
contains
an
addition
to
a
half-ounce
of
marijuana
contained
in
a
box
that
was
found
on
top
of
the
bedroom
dresser.
also
in
the
dresser
was
found
a
vile
and
some
innocuous
pills
that
were
found
not
to
contain
contraband.
three,
consisted
of
some
items
that
were
recovered
the
subsequent
day
in
the
car
bel
--
registered
to
mrs.
ker,
some
seeds
which
were
marijuana,
some
seeds
which
were
not
marijuana,
a
package
found
i
believe,
if
the
record
sustains
me,
under
the
dashboard
which
also
contained
marijuana.
mr.
gordon
ringer
oh,
well,
this
was
just
to
what
--
the
numbe
--
numeration
is
just
the
way
the
court
has
been
grouping
evidence.
mr.
gordon
ringer
well,
the
matter
was
litigated,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
ringer
that's
my
point.
mr.
gordon
ringer
the
matter
was
litigated
as
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
wasn't
litigated.
mr.
gordon
ringer
what?
mr.
gordon
ringer
oh,
the
only
question
that
was
raised
at
the
probable
cause
hearing
which
immediately
came
at
the
inception
of
the
trial
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
it
is
in
effect
a
motion
to
suppress.
it's
called
a
motion
under
995
of
the
california
penal
code.
mr.
gordon
ringer
it
was
called
a
probable
cause
hearing
and
the
only
evidence
that
was
discussed
was
the
brick.
mr.
gordon
ringer
oh,
no,
no,
no.
i
certainly
don't
go
that
far,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
ringer
assuming
arguendo
that
one
was
legally
obtained
and
one
was
illegally
obtained.
mr.
gordon
ringer
the
fact
of
the
illegality
would
not
taint
the
entire
conviction
where
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
that's
right.
mr.
gordon
ringer
that's
right.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
i'm
saying
that
also.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
believe
2
was
valid.
the
--
2
clearly,
under
my
position,
would
be
that
the
items
in
2
found
in
the
kitchen
cupboard
and
the
items
also
found
in
the
bedroom
were
conducted
in
the
course
of
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
which
was
not
unreasonable
in
scope,
namely--
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
yes.
mr.
gordon
ringer
that's
right.
mr.
gordon
ringer
that's
the
distinction
i
would
draw.
that's
all.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
i
would
think
so,
certainly,
the
minimum
extent.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
would
say
so,
if
the
--
everything
follows.
excuse
me,
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
case
isn't
here
necessarily,
but
it
would
tend
to
follow
if
1
is
correct.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
really
do
not
know
what
was
in
the
mind
of
counsel.
mr.
gordon
ringer
no,
it
doesn't.
this
would
be
entirely
speculative,
your
honor.
to
say
that
the
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
believe
they're
all
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
well
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
not
where
we
have
liquor
or
some
other
item,
your
honor,
because,
as
mr.
stanley
points
out,
we're
dealing
with
the
same
--
either
all
at
the
same
time
of
contraband,
your
honor,
you
see.
mr.
gordon
ringer
the
three
articles
of
--
three
separate
items
of
the
same
material.
mr.
gordon
ringer
that's
right.
mr.
gordon
ringer
that's
right.
mr.
gordon
ringer
that's
right.
mr.
gordon
ringer
exactly.
mr.
gordon
ringer
exactly.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
gordon
ringer
arguendo
at
the
most.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
would
assume,
your
honor,
though
the
record
is
not
specific
on
this,
but
it
ensued
almost
immediately.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes.
mr.
gordon
ringer
the
only
litigation,
your
honor,
of
the
matter
was
prior
to
page
45
of
the
record.
to
be
exact,
the
middle
--
from
the
middle
of
the
page
to
the
bottom
of
page
43
to
about
10
lines
from
the
top
of
page
44,
and
again
a
very
fairly
lengthy
paragraph
at
the
bottom
of
page
44.
this
consists
of
the
argument
of
counsel
upon
the
probable
cause
hearing.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
he
did.
mr.
gordon
ringer
with
this
exception,
your
honor,
that
at
the
probable
cause
hearing,
nothing
was
said
about
anything
that
was
found
in
the
bedroom
or
elsewhere
other
than
the
kitchen.
mr.
gordon
ringer
so
that
really
isn't
within
its
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
that's
right.
it
isn't
within
the
scope
of
the
rule.
mr.
gordon
ringer
whether
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
a
valid
arrest.
i
accept
justice
white's
suggestion
whether
it
was
a
valid
arrest
and
also
as
to
the
scope
of
whatever
was
actually
litigated
at
that
time,
namely
the
brick.
to
revert
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
no,
i
connect
it
to
an
arrest
and
the
court
found
there
was
probable
cause
for
an
arrest.
mr.
gordon
ringer
(inaudible)
mr.
gordon
ringer
all
there
is,
your
honor,
that
i
find
is
a
statement
at
the
bottom
of
page
36
that
the
--
excuse
me,
i've
gotten
my
page
wrong.
i
don't
find
any
specific
statement
by
defense
counsel,
your
honor,
except
this
intention
to
call
the
informer
black
to
controvert
the
contention
of
the
officers
that
black
had
given
information
to
the
officers
respecting
this
defendant
and
reverting
now
to
the
question
of
probable
cause
for
an
arrest.
i
wish
to
mention
first
that
it
is
not
california's
contention
that
california
law
in
this
case
should
be
constain
--
should
be
sustained
merely
because
it
is
ours
and
because
we
love
it.
our
contention
is
that,
subsequent
to
the
mapp
decision,
california
standards
should
be
sustained
by
this
court
if
those
standards
are
reasonable
within
the
due
process
clause.
we
certainly
do
not
demand
absolute
carte
blanche
for
absolute
everything
that
conceivably
come
into
the
minds
of
the
california
legislature
of
the
california
court.
it
is
our
position
that
the
arrest
in
this
case
of
petitioner,
george
ker,
was
a
valid
arrest
based
upon
probable
cause.
the
standards
in
this
case
of
probable
cause
being
the
same
under
california
law
as
they
are
under
federal
law
that
the
search
of
the
apartment
was
based
upon
reason
--
excuse
me,
that
the
search
of
the
apartment
was
a
reasonable
search
as
an
incident
to
the
arrest
and
also,
if
i
may
add,
the
methods
by
which
the
officers
gain
entry
into
the
apartment
were
not
illegal.
now,
turning
to
the
facts,
i
think
that
mr.
stanley
in
his
argument
for
petitioner
has
unnecessarily
restricted
the
meaning
of
the
information
which
the
officers
possessed
at
the
time
they
entered
the
apartment
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
arrest.
we
can
speculate
what
they
might
have
done
under
other
facts,
under
other
circumstances.
the
question
is
raised
if
the
officers
believed
at
the
time
they
saw
ker
and
murphy
at
this
meet,
a
meet
incidentally
in
the
same
spot
where
cook
and
terrhagen
had
actually
consummated
a
transaction
of
narcotics
the
night
before,
the
only
distinction
being
that
cook
and
terrhagen
were
on
the
east
side
of
the
street
facing
north
and
ker
and
murphy
were
on
the
west
side
of
the
fairfax
street
facing
south.
why
didn't
they
arrest
him
at
this
time?
the
officers
--
officer
warthen
didn't
know
ker,
didn't
know
him
personally.
of
course
he
got
a
look
at
him
and
he
was
able
to
identify
him
for
the
purposes
of
trial
as
a
man
whom
he
saw,
but
he
didn't
know
george
ker.
the
one
who
knew
george
ker,
who
had
seen
his
picture,
and
who
received
information
that
ker
was
a
purchaser
of
narcotics
from
murphy
was
officer
berman
who
didn't
come
into
the
picture
with
respect
to
this
arrest
until
later.
in
other
words,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
a
block.
having
failed
to
follow
--
to
track
ker
to
his
lair
due
to
this
illusive
u-turn
which
he
took
losing
the
officers,
the
officers
attempted
to
find
out
who
he
was.
they
checked
with
the
department
of
motor
vehicles
and
they
learned
that
this
automobile
which
they
have
witnessed
murphy
approach
and
where
murphy
and
ker
have
a
conversation
is
an
automobile
registered
to
ker
and
registered
at
a
given
address,
4801
slauson,
which
is
on
slauson
and
extremely
near
the
intersection
of
fairfax
and
slauson,
near
where,
the
night
before,
there
had
actually
been
consummated
a
narcotics
transaction
and
where,
the
same
night,
not
half-an-hour
previously,
the
officers
had
seen
ker
and
murphy
meet.
and
prior
to
that,
had
seen
and
tracked
murphy
to
his
lair
in
the
oil
fields
where
he
arguably,
the
officers
had
reason
to
believe,
kept
his
stash
because
that's
where
he
went
the
night
before
when
he
transacted
the
narcotics
sale
with
cook
and
terrhagen.
realizing
now
who
the
car
was
registered
to,
having
transmitted
that
information
to
officer
berman
within
15
to
30
minutes
following
this
meeting
between
ker
and
murphy,
the
officers
tell
berman,
“we've
checked
the
car
out.”
the
officers
tell
berman
what
they
had
seen.
berman
tells
him
--
tells
them
what
he
knew.
therefore,
this
--
what
to
the
layman
might
appear
to
be
an
ambiguous
meeting
between
a
narcotics
seller
and
another
man
but
comes
in
the
light
of
the
officers'
experience,
these
were
experienced
officers.
they
are
not
neophytes.
berman
had
3
years
experience
and
had
participated
in
300
arrests,
i
believe.
warthen,
i
believe,
4
years
as
a
narcotics
officer,
had
participated
in
what
he
called
quite
a
few
hundred
arrests.
these
are
experienced
officers.
these
facts
previously
known
to
them,
this
information,
we
submit,
reasonably
justified
them
as
prudent
and
cautious
men,
there's
no
doubt
that
they
were,
at
that
time,
in
a
belief
that
there
had
been
an
actual
consummated
narcotic
transaction
between
ker
and
murphy
at
that
night.
and
bear
in
mind,
the
information
which
the
--
all
the
officers
possessed
at
the
time
they
entered
that
apartment,
at
the
time
rather
that
they
approached
the
apartment
was
not
the
information
which
warthen
alone
and
markman
alone
had
at
the
time
of
seeing
the
meet,
they
superimposed
upon
that
the
information
from
berman.
we
submit
that,
under
california
law,
as
well
as
under
federal
law,
the
officers
were
certainly
warranted
in
entertaining
a
belief
that
ker
had
committed
that
offense.
now,
turning
to
the
entry
of
the
apartment,
mr.
stanley
has
made
the
point
in
oral
argument
that
section
844
which
is
the
california
entry
for
purpose
of
arrest
statute
has
been
made
a
dead
letter.
i
believe
this
is
an
exaggeration.
maddox
in
46
cal.2d
is
the
leading
case
on
this
subject,
as
i
believe
it
was
justice
brennan
who
mentioned
during
mr.
stanley's
argument.
there,
of
course,
had
been
cases
subsequent
to
maddox.
but
california
exception
to
the
entry
for
purpose
of
arrest
statute
which
requires
the
officers
to
announce
their
authority
and
purpose
before
entering
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes.
this
is
an
arrest
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes.
this
is
an
arrest
statute.
mr.
gordon
ringer
844
is
an
arrest
statute.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
to
effect,
an
arrest.
mr.
gordon
ringer
that's
correct.
we've
got
a
service
of
search
warrant,
section
2,
that's
1531
and
1532
of
the
penal
code.
mr.
gordon
ringer
they're
comparable
to
the
federal
execution
of
a
search
warrant
statute.
we
do
in
two
sections
what
the
federal
statute
more
compendiously
does
in
one.
now,
the
california
exception
is
as
follows.
if
the
officers,
as
reasonable
men
again,
entertain
a
belief
that
the
arrest
will
be
frustrated,
if
they
complied
with
the
statutory
formalities,
the
officers
are
excused
from
compliance
with
the
section.
secondly,
the
second
exception,
if
the
officers
as
reasonable
men,
entertain
an
honest
and
reasonably
based
belief
that
if
they
comply
with
the
formalities
contraband
evidence
would
be
destroyed,
they
are
likewise
to
be
excused.
a
more
recent
case
than
maddox
upon
this
point
is
the
case
of
hammond
which
is
in
54
cal.2d
involving
the
same
situation.
now
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
think
they
busted
in,
in
hammond,
your
honor.
the
facts
when
one
reads
100
cases
in
preparation
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
sometimes
the
facts
tend
to
cloud,
sir.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i've
seen
quite
a
few
cases
on
the
subject.
mr.
gordon
ringer
only
if
the
facts
come
within
the
exception
that
there
is
(inaudible)
--
would
have
to
be
--
first
of
all,
the
arrest
statute
allows
the
breaking
in,
physical
breaking
in
where
there
is
authority
and
purpose
announced
by
the
officers.
the
statutory
exception
allows
them
to
bust
in
physically
if
the
officers
are
excused
under
the
judicial
gloss
placed
on
the
statute.
the
reason
for
getting
a
key
rather
than
busting
in
is
of
course,
prevent
destruction
of
property,
for
one
reason
why
they
would
enter,
use
a
key
rather
than
bursting
in.
and
also,
because
as
warthen
testified
in
this
case,
bear
in
mind,
your
honor,
warthen
is
an
experienced
officer.
he's
participated
in
300
arrests
or
more.
warthen
testified
at
the
bottom
of
93
of
the
record.
he
was
asked
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
about
the
surreptitious
entry
into
the
apartment
and
i'll
quote
it.
it's
short
but
i
think
it's
quite
relevant.
“why
would
you
be
very
careful
as
a
narcotics
investigating
officer?”
here
is
this
word
“investigating.”
the
word
“investigating,”
i
may
add,
is
given
a
kind
of
mystic
significance
by
mr.
stanley.
“why
would
you
be
very
careful
as
a
narcotic
investigating
officer
to
be
extremely
quiet
when
you
have
a
key
in
your
hand
entering
a
house
in
which
you
think
there
is
a
possibility
of
narcotics
possession
being
committed?”
answer:
“because
on
many,
many
occasions,
persons
who
flush
narcotics
down
toilets,
pushed
them
down
drains
and
sinks,
and
many
other
methods
of
getting
rid
of
them
prior
to
my
entrance
when
i
had
made
noises
in
the
process
of
entering.”
mr.
gordon
ringer
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
quite
get
the
important
question.
mr.
gordon
ringer
and
why
not?
why
not,
your
honor,
a
duplicate
purpose?
if
they
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
a
man,
as
well
as
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
contraband
is
there.
mr.
gordon
ringer
if
upon
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
perhaps
not
there
and
at
that
time,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
ringer
you're
right,
your
honor.
perhaps
they
would
not.
they
knew
it
had
been
all
disposed
of,
but
this,
they
did
not
know.
they
knew
that
they
had
in
his
house
a
person
whom
they
had
great
reason
to
believe
was
a
seller.
mr.
gordon
ringer
sure.
mr.
gordon
ringer
sure.
mr.
gordon
ringer
it's
an
extremely
important
consideration,
your
honor,
it
is.
there's
no
question
about
that.
in
this
and
in
any
other
contraband
case
and
of
course,
in
any
other
case
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
hmm?
mr.
gordon
ringer
to
some
extent,
yes.
but
as
justice
treanor
points
out
in
the
maddox
case,
i
may
say,
first,
this
is
contraband
to
which
the
defendant
has
no
--
which
the
defendant
has
no
right
to
possess
anyway.
i'm
not
saying
he
has
no
standing
to
complain
of
the
search,
but
this
is
contraband
and
the
california
health
and
safety
code
contains
provision
which
i
understand
are
similar
to
the
provisions
announced
in
trupiano
case.
it
mentioned
that
we
won't
return
the
stuff
to
him,
but
the
california
statutes
are
11653
to
11657
of
the
health
and
safety
code
which
is
the
provision
of
the
code
concerning
narcotics.
even
if
mr.
ker
will
acquit,
his
stuff
could
not
be
returned.
i
use
“stuff”
as
a
term
of
art,
if
you
please,
to
refer
to
narcotics.
mr.
gordon
ringer
well,
the
court
here
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
this
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
well,
it
was
first
--
i
may
first,
given
the
answer
which
no
doubt
would
be
unsatisfactory
if
the
court
approved
it
in
this
case,
of
course.
but
there
are
cases
subsequent
to
maddox,
expanding
the
exception
in
maddox
to
where
the
officer
does
have
reason
to
believe
this
will
happen.
now,
one
of
the
facts
in
this
case
is
the
officers'
experience.
i
could,
if
your
honor
wish,
cite
you
by
letter
or
otherwise.
mr.
gordon
ringer
what
would
your
honor
--
how
--
may
i
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
may
i
pose
a
question
rhetorically,
your
honor?
not
that
i'm
asking
your
honor
to
ask
me
but
for
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
--
argument
purposes
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
put
it
--
i
know
you
don't
a
--
you
asked
my
answer.
mr.
gordon
ringer
but
sir,
the
rhetorical
question
is
this.
what
would
have
happened,
your
honor,
if
the
officers
had
knocked,
said
--
someone
comes
to
the
door.
the
officers
said,
“we
are
officers
markman
and
berman
of
the
sherriff's
department.
we
are
here
for
a
certain
purpose.”
now,
if
i
may
make
this
point,
just
as
certain
weapon
are
tools
of
the
police
for
the
war
against
crime,
indoor
plumbing
consisting
of
the
toilet,
the
drain,
and
the
garbage
disposal
are
weapons
of
the
criminal.
perhaps
i
am
stating
this
more
eloquently
than
it
ought
to
be
because
it's
a
rather
minimal
subject
for
inflated
eloquence,
but
it's
true
nevertheless,
sir.
if
the
officers
had
not,
mind
you,
you've
got
a
--
you've
got
one
man
in
his
lair
who's
not
a
simple,
happy
partaker
of
the
hobby,
sir,
but
he
is
--
the
officers
have
reason
to
believe,
a
cold
and
calculating
seller
of
narcotics.
i'll
leave
the
words
“coldly
calculating”
out
as
they
merely
add
color.
but,
he's
a
se
--
believed
to
be
a
retail
seller
of
narcotics.
had
they
knocked
at
that
door
and
demanded
entry,
then
the
officers,
i
believe,
had
reason
to
believe,
not
only
incidentally
that
warthen
testified,
markman
was
outside
the
window
ready
to
catch
the
marijuana
if
it
would
come
flying
out
the
window.
the
officers
certainly,
on
the
basis
of
their
past
experience
and
the
reported
cases
sustained
them,
in
the
100
instances,
where
they
do?
at
least
knock
on
the
door
and
this
takes
place
in
the
belief
that
ker,
knowing
ker
to
be
whom
they
had
reason
to
believe,
would've
attempted
to
dispose
and
perhaps
could've
succeeded
in
disposing
that
marijuana.
now,
having
entered
the
apartment,
if
the
court
please,
the
question
arises
whether
the
kilo-brick
of
marijuana
which
was
discovered,
sir,
in
plain
sight
in
the
kitchen
without
the
entry
of
a
closed
door
into
the
kitchen
from
the
living
room,
was
the
product
of
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
california
found
that
it
was
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
great
weight
should
be
given
to
this
finding
by
the
california
court.
now,
the
actual
arrest
of
petitioners,
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
officers,
occurred
following
to
the
finding
of
this
brick
of
marijuana.
california's
position
on
this
subject
has
been
rationalized
by
justice
treanor
of
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
simons
case,
in
45
cal.2d,
using
reasoning
which
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
simons.
i
can
give
your
honor
the
page
citation
if
you
would
wish.
it's
quoted
at
length
in
our
brief.
this
reasoning
i
believe
is
sound
reasoning
and
i
respectfully
commended
to
the
court
as
being
reasoning
which,
in
support
of
the
result
which
is
fully
consistent
with
standards
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
in
justice
treanor's
reasoning,
if
i
may
paraphrase
him,
is
as
follows.
the
officers,
as
i
argue
here
and
i'll
apply
the
reasoning
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
to
make
it
more
compelling,
if
i'm
able
to
make
it
compelling,
the
officers
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
ker
for
possession
of
marijuana.
under
the
federal
cases
and
i
take
it,
that
rabinowitz
obtains
as
it
is
under
the
law
of
california,
the
officers
have
the
right,
as
an
incident
to
that
arrest
based
upon
probable
cause
to
conduct
a
search
not
unreasonable
in
extent
of
the
person
and
property
of
the
offenders,
the
kers,
for
the
purpose
of
--
certainly
at
the
very
least,
of
discovering
the
contraband
for
whose
possession
they
were
arrested.
there
is,
therefore,
a
right,
if
you
will,
to
invade
the
privacy
of
the
defendants,
the
petitioners.
i
can
think
of
very
few
invasions
of
the
right
to
privacy
more
catastrophic
than
an
arrest
and
it
is
our
position
here
that
the
arrest
was
valid
as
based
on
probable
cause.
if
there
is
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest,
it
is
certainly
no
more
a
violation
of
the
right
to
privacy
or
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
accused
for
the
search
to
precede
rather
than
to
follow
the
arrest,
so
long
as
independently
of
what
has
turned
up
in
the
search,
the
officers
have
probable
cause
for
making
the
arrest.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes?
mr.
gordon
ringer
the
testimony
of
berman
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
--
is
quite
clear
and
specific
on
this
point,
your
honor.
at
the
probable
cause
hearing,
officer
berman
testified,
this
is
the
first
long
paragraph
on
the
page
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
31
of
the
record,
sir.
i
had
estimated
as
10
or
12
lines
down
from
the
top.
mr.
gordon
ringer
“we
ascertained
the
parties
were
at
home.”
now,
that
could've
been
tested
on
cross-examination
and
was
not.
now
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
i
would.
mr.
gordon
ringer
sure,
except
--
with
this
exception,
your
honor.
well
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
no,
it
would
not,
sir.
mr.
gordon
ringer
that
would
not,
sir.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
yes
sir.
i
didn't
mean
to
--
(inaudible)
--
if
you're
going
to
concede
a
point,
your
honor,
you
always
want
about
5
or
10
seconds
of
appreciation
of
what
it
is
and
that
is
correct.
i
agree
with
your
honor.
that's
my
case.
mr.
gordon
ringer
that's
my
case.
now,
before
leaving,
i
do
wish
to
mention
the
problem
of
the
search
warrant
which
has
been
raised,
and
fairly
raised,
by
mr.
stanley.
and
i
would
not
seek
to
conclude
my
argument
by
failing
to
mention
the
subject.
as
has
been
said
before,
the
problem
whether
officers
are
required
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
where
there
is
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
is
one
which
has
produced
manifest
divisions
of
opinion
among
justices
presently
sitting
on
this
court,
among
justices
previously
sitting
on
this
court.
as
we
understand
the
law,
as
it
obtains
in
the
federal
courts,
rabinowitz
does
obtain
that
the
question
is
not
was
there
time
to
get
a
warrant,
but
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
there
was
and
that's
--
i
recall
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
recall
your
honor's
statement
in
the
dissent
in
abel
versus
the
united
states
that
it
was
sanctioned
only
inferentially.
that
is
true.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
believe
there
is.
certainly,
in
abel
--
i
--
here,
i
am
trespassing
on
grounds
of
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
--
that
i
perhaps
should
not.
perhaps
i
should
not
and
for
obvious
reasons,
i
shan't.
but
certainly,
let
me
say
this
as
a
minimum,
that
it
is
at
least
california's
understanding
of
the
rabinowitz
decision
that
it
goes
farther
than
your
honor
says
it
explicitly
goes.
let
me
phrase
it
that
way
in
a
non-contentious
manner.
now,
let
us
assume
that
trupiano
were
to
be
restored
and
rabinowitz
were
to
be
overruled.
waiving
the
question
whether
this
would
be
a
desirable
result,
i'm
not
arguing
that
from
the
federal
courts
because
i
do
not
think
this
could
profitably
argued
as
a
question
federal
law
at
least
without
the
appearance
of
mr.
solicitor.
the
question
would
arise
whether,
first,
if
trupiano
were
restored,
states
would
under
the
due
process
clause
be
bound
to
follow
it.
and
second,
where
even
under
the
facts
here,
sir,
were
trupiano
the
law,
whether
this
would
be
a
trupiano
case,
i
submit
it
would
not.
because
the
exception
in
trupiano
was
that
a
warrant,
even
where
a
warrant
might
be
required,
is
required
only
where
the
obtainment
of
a
warrant
would
be
practical.
now,
if
i
may
say
this,
it
would
not
have
been
absolutely
physically
impossible
if
the
officers
have
delayed
entry
into
this
apartment
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
the
warrant,
it
would've
been
not
absolutely
physically
impossible.
but,
the
officers
had
tracked
this
man
to
the
lair.
they
knew
he
was
selling
from
his
apartment.
this
was
at
the
night
time,
9
o
clock.
be
it
9:30,
would've
taken
the
officers
quite
some
time
to
find
a
deputy
district
attorney
who
could
write
an
affidavit
for
them.
police
officers
don't,
unless
they
are
vastly
experienced
in
such
matters,
write
affidavits.
and
the
affidavit
would
have
to
be,
not
merely
complex
as
the
facts
here
are
complex
but
sufficient
to
obtain
not
merely
the
approval
of
the
magistrate
but
good
enough
to
survive
post-arrest
attack
upon
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavit
to
constitute
probable
cause
for
a
search
warrant.
not
only
is
that
true,
they
then
have
to
find
a
magistrate
and
mr.
stanley
has
referred
liberally
to
experience
in
the
california
courts.
it's
just
hard
to
find
a
deputy
district
attorney
at
that
hour,
harder
to
find
a
magistrate
in
cases
other
than
this
where
the
man
is
tracked
to
his
lair
in
a
completely
unbuilt
up
area.
you
know
how
large
los
angeles
county
is.
we're
50
miles
by
50
miles
in
both
directions.
your
honors
have
experienced
this.
the
difficulties
would
be
inculpable.
it
might
be
said,
of
course,
that
the
officer
could've
left
the
man
at
the
door.
but
i
think,
and
this
has
been
mentioned
in
the
johnson
case,
the
opium
smoking
case,
they
could've
guarded
the
door.
it's
been
mentioned
in
jeffers,
in
342
united
states.
they
could've
guarded
the
door.
but
what
would
have
happened
in
this
case
if
they've
left
someone
to
guard
the
door
while
the
remaining
officers
went
out
to
get
a
warrant?
ker,
as
they
knew,
supplied
out
of
his
apartment.
suppose
one
of
his
clients
walked
up
to
the
apartment,
what
could
that
officer
do?
if
he
attempted
to
block
that
man's
entrance,
the
man
would
go
away
and
telephone
ker
and
within
a
few
minutes,
the
officer
would
reasonably
hear
the
sound
of
the
disposal,
the
narcotics
being
disposed
of.
and
there
would
go
the
evidence
the
officers
were
out
attempting
to
obtain
a
warrant
for
the
purpose
of
security.
now,
in
summary
of
our
position,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
california's
view
which
we
earnestly
and
sincerely
maintain,
that,
notwithstanding
the
argument
presented
by
mr.
stanley,
the
question
remains
under
mapp
versus
ohio,
one
of
due
process,
that
under
the
due
process
clause,
that
california's
standards
are
reasonable
and
the
finding
based
upon
those
standards
are
reasonable.
they
should
be
upheld
by
this
court
and
should
not
be
cast
out.
it
is
likewise
our
position
that
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
the
officers,
under
the
standards
imposed
under
the
federal
courts
as
well
as
under
the
california
courts,
have
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
of
petitioner,
george
ker.
as
to
mrs.
ker,
i
rest
upon
what
i
said
in
the
brief.
respecting
the
entry,
it
is
california's
position
that
it
was
lawful
under
the
exception
to
the
statutes
engrafted
by
judicial
decision.
and
on
this
point,
i
may
make
this
point,
and
i
think
it's
a
valid
one
to
make,
that
in
miller
versus
the
united
states,
in
357
u.s.,
the
government
explicitly
refused
to
raise
the
question
of
exigent
circumstances
where
there
was
an
ambiguous
attempt
to
gain
entrance
at
the
door.
so,
i
do
not
have
against
me,
upon
this
point
any
case
of
this
court
specifically
examined
in
this
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
no,
this
is
a
statutory
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes.
i
certainly
do
not
retreat
from
that
position,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
ringer
perhaps
it
did,
but
the
point
i
mentioned
miller
for
is
that
this
question
has
never
even
arisen
here,
though
i'm
grateful.
mr.
gordon
ringer
in
a
constitutional
sense
or
the
exigent
circumstance
exception
hasn't
arisen
here
in
any
sense
because
the
government
specifically
refuse
to
raise
it
in
miller.
citing
maddox
as
an
example
of
that
other
states
have
a
rule.
respecting
the
search,
it
is
california's
contention
that
the
search
was
incident
to
the
lawful
arrest
of
petitioner,
george
ker,
that
these
convictions
rest
upon
evidence
obtained
in
violation
and
interrogation
of
no
constitutional
guarantee
that
under
the
findings
of
the
trial
court,
as
approved
by
the
california
intermediate
court,
and
in
consequence
of
rational
reasonable
standards,
these
convictions
should
be
sustained.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
ringer
well,
there's
only
one
case
construing
that.
that's
the
case
of
shelton
in
151
cal.app.2d.
let
me
verify
the
citation
by
checking
with
our
little
compendium
here.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
it
is.
that
was
an
execution
of
a
search
warrant.
mr.
gordon
ringer
151.
that's
the
one
case
i
know
of.
mr.
gordon
ringer
what?
mr.
gordon
ringer
shelton.
mr.
gordon
ringer
shelton.
and
in
that
case,
when
they
forced
entry,
i
think
they
used
a
sledgehammer
rather
than
obtaining
the
key.
they
found
the
man
in
the
process,
i
think
it
was
a
burning
with
it
--
burning
the
material
that
was
the
subject
of
the
search
warrant.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
would
presume.
mr.
gordon
ringer
wait
a
minute
--
wait
minute
--
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
gordon
ringer
no.
no,
though
i
say
this.
it's
always
to
the
advantage
of
the
officer
executing
a
search
warrant
to
have
someone
home
if
only
because
your
honor
will
recall
in
the
record
here,
although
this
is
collateral
to
the
main
point,
that
the
officers
were
quite
careful
to
have
both
petitioners
here
with
them
in
every
room
where
they
searched.
so,
there
could
be
no
question
of
them,
say,
seizing
jewelry
and
making
off
with
it.
and
it
would
probably
be
to
their
advantage,
under
a
warrant,
to
have
a
defendant
home
or
the
person
whose
premises
were
to
be
seized
(inaudible)
precisely
that
purpose.
mr.
gordon
ringer
oh,
i
--
pardon
me,
your
honor.
i
see
the
drift
of
your
honor's
question
now
where
i
did
not
see
it
before.
1531
and
1532
are
the
--
of
the
penal
code
are
the
--
yes,
are
the
relevant
sections.
i
would
presume
--
excuse
me.
yes,
1531
is
the
relevant
section
on
the
execution
of
a
search
warrant
and
it
is
quite
similar
in
language
to
844
of
the
penal
code
which
is
the
entry
to
arrest
section.
i
would
assume,
subject
to
correction
by
the
california
court
that
the
same
--
certainly,
the
same
exceptions
to
the
search
warrant
statute
would
be
applied
to
the
--
to
it
as
are
applied
to
the
arrest.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
under
the
direction
of
the
magistrate,
the
statute
on
this,
1533
of
the
penal
code.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
sir.
there
has
been
a
recent
amendment,
your
honor.
this
is
a
1961
amendment.
would
your
honor
care
for
me
to
read
it
or
simply
to
cite
the
1533
of
the
penal
code?
mr.
gordon
ringer
on
a
showing
of
good
cause,
therefore
--
it's
quite
short.
on
a
showing
of
good
cause,
therefore,
the
magistrate
may
in
his
discretion,
and
search
a
direction
in
the
warrant
that
it
may
be
served
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night.
in
the
absence
of
such
a
direction,
the
warrant
may
be
served
only
in
the
day
time.
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
believe
the
--
i
believe
41
says
the
affidavits
have
to
be
positive
or
something,
but
then
that
means
the
same
thing
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
ringer
it
was
8:45
pm,
according
to
the
testimony
of
deputy
markman
who
was
most
observant
of
the
officers.
mr.
gordon
ringer
it
was
8:45
pm,
according
to
markan
who
was
the
most
observant
of
the
officers
at
the
point
--
on
point
of
time
that
they
got
to
the
fairfax
and
slauson
area.
it
was
15
minutes
later
that
this
meeting
had
consummated.
that
would
put
it
at
9
o'
clock,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
gordon
ringer
within
15
to
30
minutes
after
that,
and
the
officer
put
a
minimum
of
15
and
a
maximum
of
30,
they
had
communicated
to
berman
what
they
had
observed
and
also,
in
addition
to
what
they
had
observed,
the
information
they
received
from
the
department
of
motor
vehicles.
this
is
at
the
foot
of
page
24
of
the
record.
and
it
was
presumably
at
that
time
that
they
learned
from
berman
what
they
--
what
he
knew.
and
the
testimony
here
of
warthen
following
that,
“did
you
have
a
conversation
concerning
mr.
george
ker?”
and
i
can
imagine
the
rhetorical
emphasis
in
which
he
said,
“yes,
sir.”
then,
immediately
following
this
and
this
had
--
put
it
at
9:30,
9:15
to
9:30,
they
went
to
the
apartment.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
justice
stewart?
mr.
gordon
ringer
i
have
no
figures
whatsoever
as
to
arrest
warrants.
with
respect
to
search
warrants,
the
only
information
i
was
able
to
obtain
is
contained
in
a
footnote
in
an
article
which
we
refer
in
some
detail
in
our
brief.
it's
the
article
by
professor
collins.
he
--
the
footnotes
to
an
article
in
the
cal
peace
officer,
a
statement
that
since
about
1933,
there
are,
if
i
am
correct
--
if
i
quote
him
correctly,
there
were
issued
somewhat
between
500
and
600
search
warrants
in
los
angeles
county.
that's
all
the
information
i've
got.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
yes.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
but
i
have
no
statistics
as
to
whether
this
increased
or
decreased
since
cahan.
and
that's
all
the
information
i've
got
on
this
subject.
mr.
gordon
ringer
oh,
yes.
i
regret
that
i
am
at
the
present
moment
unable
to
be
further
informative.
but
that's
all
i
have
at
the
moment
on
that
subject.
i'd
be
delighted
to
conduct
further
research
for
your
honor,
if
you
wish,
but
that's
all
i
could
find
statistic-wise.
mr.
gordon
ringer
may
i
make
one
point.
i
think
this
is
essential
to
make,
certainly
respecting
arrest
warrants.
that
the
california
have
permitted
the
police
officer
to
arrest
without
warrant
for
felony
for
a
much
longer
time
than
the
federal
statutes
have
permitted
narcotics
officers
to
arrest
without
warrants.
7607
of
title
26
is
an
awfully
recent
statute.
mr.
gordon
ringer
and
there's
--
oh,
there's
another
awfully
important
point
which
i'm
glad
i
recalled
it
as
the
hour
is
approaching
lunch
time.
it
is
the
policy
of
the
california
courts
to
encourage
search
warrants.
with
this
respect,
i
would
like
to
cite
the
case
of
people
versus
keener
in
55
cal.2d.
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
that's
in
our
compendium.
mr.
gordon
ringer
k-e-e-n-e-r.
yes,
yes,
it
is
the
california
policy
--
mr.
gordon
ringer
--
that
was
(inaudible)
mr.
gordon
ringer
yes,
as
well
of
course,
as
the
philosophy
of
cahan
to
encourage
warrants.
i
wish
in
absolute
conclusion,
simply
upon
the
general
question
of
the
cons
--
of
the
standards
to
be
applied
to
the
states
in
california,
to
cite
a
law
review
article
by
justice
treanor
of
the
california
supreme
court.
this
article
was
discovered
by
us
too
late
to
include
in
our
brief,
but
i
would
like
to
cite
it,
it's
called
mapp
versus
ohio
at
large
in
the
50
states
by
justice
treanor
of
the
california
supreme
court.
it's
contained
in
the
summer
issue
of
the
duke
law
journal.
mr.
gordon
ringer
duke,
duke
university.
mr.
gordon
ringer
the
pagination,
it
starts
at
page
319
thereof.
mr.
gordon
ringer
it
says
volume
1962,
summer,
number
3,
at
page
319.
mr.
gordon
ringer
the
article
commences
at
319,
your
honor.
it
is
therefore
respectfully
requested,
if
your
honor
please,
that
the
judgments
were
--
with
which
review
is
sought
from
this
court
be
affirmed.
