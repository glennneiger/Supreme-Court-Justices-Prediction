mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
these
are
two
school
segregation
cases,
consolidated
for
argument
before
this
court
arising
in
knoxville
and
davidson
county,
tennessee.
davidson
county
is
the
suburban
county
surrounding
the
city
of
nashville.
both
of
these
cases
were
tried
and
decided
separately
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
they
both
present
common
questions
of
law
and
fact
and
are
consolidated
here
for
argument.
the
knoxville
case
was
filed
on
december
1959
and
involved
at
the
outset
a
grade
a
year,
12-year
desegregation
plan
approved
by
the
district
court.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
a
12-year
plan
was
not
fast
enough
and
reversed
on
this
aspect
of
the
case.
their
characterization
of
the
board's
plan
appears
on
page
161
of
the
record
in
their
opinion.
and
i'd
like
to
quote
a
sentence
briefly.
the
evidence
does
not
indicate
that
the
board
is
confronted
with
the
type
of
administrative
problems
contemplated
by
the
supreme
court
in
the
second
brown
decision.
and
further
down
on
that
page,
the
position
of
the
board
that
it
would
continue
to
operate
under
these
unenforceable
laws
until
compelled
by
law
to
do
otherwise
does
not
commend
itself
to
the
court
for
the
acceptance
of
a
plan
that
provides
for
a
minimum
degree
of
desegregation.
so
i
as
stated,
it
disapproved
the
12-year
aspect
of
the
plan
but
it
--
and
it
also
in
a
separate
opinion
later
decided,
disapproved
the
plan
of
the
board
with
regard
to
vocational
school.
and
neither
of
those
two
aspects
of
the
case
are
involved
in
this
petition.
however,
the
court
did
uphold
a
racial
transfer
plan
which
was
part
of
this
desegregation
plan
and
i
will
describe
this
plan
in
a
moment
because
it
is
identical
to
the
racial
transfer
plan
that
appears
in
the
davidson
county
case.
the
davidson
county
case
was
filed
in
september
1960
and
it
too
involved
a
grade
a
year
plan.
the
district
court
held
that
this
was
not
fast
enough
under
the
standards
set
down
by
this
court
in
the
second
brown
decision.
and
it
required
the
respondents
to
desegregate
four
grades
in
january
of
1961
and
file
by
september
of
1961.
in
other
words,
to
catch
up
with
the
city
of
nashville
with
which
it
was
contiguous.
the
district
court
refused
to
allow
the
named
individual
plaintiffs
not
covered
by
the
grades
of
the
plan
to
receive
a
nonsegregated
education.
now,
the
racial
transfer
aspect
and
the
right
of
the
individual
plaintiffs
both
were
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
racial
transfer
aspect
and
also
upheld
the
refusal
to
allow
the
individual
petitioners
to
obtain
a
desegregated
education
and
grades
other
than
those
covered
by
the
plan.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i
was
just
about
to
say.
we
brought
the
racial
transfer
aspect
of
both
cases
and
the
right
of
the
individual
plaintiffs
here.
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
only
with
regard
to
the
common
question
of
both
cases
and
that
is
the
racial
transfer
aspect
of
the
plan.
both
cases
involved
racial
transfer
provisions
which
are
almost
entirely
identical
in
language.
first
--
and
they
both
appear
on
page
4
of
our
brief.
first,
both
school
systems
adopted
a
general
transfer
provision
such
as
you
might
find
in
any
school
system
in
such
as
they
had
previously
had.
that
appears
on
page
4
of
the
brief
in
the
footnote
saying
that
transfers
would
be
allowed
when
good
cause
therefore
is
shown
in
knoxville
and
davidson
county
also
using
the
words
when
good
cause
therefore
is
shown.
in
addition
to
that,
both
plans
provided
that
under
certain
circumstances
which
depended
upon
race,
the
right
to
transfer
would
be
automatic
and
those
circumstances
are
as
follows:
a.
when
a
white
student
would
otherwise
be
required
to
attend
a
school
previously
serving
colored
students
only,
b.
when
a
colored
student
would
otherwise
be
required
to
attend
a
school
previously
serving
white
students
only,
c.
when
a
student
would
otherwise
be
required
to
attend
to
school
where
the
majority
of
students
of
that
school
or
in
his
or
her
grade
are
of
a
different
race.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
was
just
about
to
come
on
page
105
in
the
record.
that
is
elucidated
by
one
of
the
respondent
in
the
knoxville
case.
the
question
“under,
your
plan,
this
provision
of
paragraph
6
a,
b
and
c
will
constitute
automatic
basis
for
transfer.
all
that
a
student
has
to
show
is
that
he
meets
these
conditions
and
then
he
will
be
automatically
entitled
the
transfer,
administratively
more
or
less?”
answer:
“if
he
requests
it?”
question:
“yes.”
answer:
“if
he
requests
it.”
that's
knoxville.
now,
in
davidson
county
on
pages
219
and
220
of
the
record,
we
have
the
same
thing.
question
by
mr.
williams.
mr.
jack
greenberg
219
and
220.
“that
under
this
provision
in
paragraph
5
of
the
plan
setting
for
these
racial
conditions
based
on
a
minority
race
transfer,
the
effect
of
it
is
to
permit
a
child
to
choose
segregation
outside
of
his
zone
but
not
to
choose
integration
outside
of
his
zone.
that
is
true,
isn't
it?”
answer:
“the
child
and
his
parents
can
choose,
yes.”
further
down
on
the
page,
mr.
williams
makes
a
statement,
the
accuracy
of
which
is
confirmed
by
the
witness.
“it's
substantially
identical
to
the
city
provision,
if
your
honor
please,
but
it
was
not
brought
to
this
court's
attention
at
the
time
that
the
city
provision
was
approved,
exactly
how
the
city
provision
operates
as
mr.
moss
had
described.
it
has
been
operated
so
that
instead
of
going
to
the
school
in
his
zone
and
there
seeking
a
transfer,
no
white
child
in
the
city
has
ever
seen
one
of
the
allegedly
integrated
schools
to
which
he
was
assigned.
no
negro
child
who
didn't
affirmatively
seek
a
transfer
to
an
integrated
school
has
ever
seen
the
integrated
school
to
which
the
national
board
led
this
court
to
believe
he
was
assigned.”
so
that
presents
a
little
different,
a
little
more
than
was
before
the
court
in
that
case.
and
then
he
asked
the
witness,
“and
that
is
true,
what
i
have
stated,
isn't
it,
mr.
moss?
that
is
the
way
the
plan
operates
in
the
city
and
that's
the
way
you
intend
to
operate
it?”
answer:
“that
is
correct.”
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
not
involved
in
this
case
except
that
both
of
these
respondents
adopted
that
plan.
mr.
jack
greenberg
right,
that's
quite
clear.
and
later
in
the
record
there
is
testimony
by
the
superintendent
of
nashville
further
describing
this
plan.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
the
suburban
county
surrounding
nashville.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
yes,
they're
the
general
transfer
provision
and
the
specific
racial
transfer
provision.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
we're
not
attacking
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
the
general
transfer
provision,
no.
now,
the
nashville
experience
upon
which
both
of
these
boards
based
their
plans
is
described
on
page
226
of
the
record
by
a
professor
in
vanderbilt
university
who
made
a
study
of
how
the
plan
operated
actually
and
this
is
without
any
contradiction.
and
he
testifies,
the
nashville
experience
would
indicate
mass
transfer,
mass
paper
transfers
of
whites
back
into
what
is
historically
the
white
school,
of
negroes
remaining
in
what
is
historically
the
negro
school.
i
would
say
that
the
transfer
provisions
tend
in
my
opinion,
tend
to
keep
the
system
oriented
toward
a
segregated
system
with
token
desegregation.
this
would
be
the
major
thrust.
officials
of
the
knoxville
board
testified
that
in
adopting
this
plan,
it
was
their
expectation
that
it
would
perpetuate
segregation
on
104.
this
--
in
a
question:
“this
inequality
of
operation
that
i
suggested
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
paragraph
6
a,
b,
c
of
this
plan
does
tend
to
perpetuate
segregation,
does
it
not,
sir?”
and
this
--
what
the
board
member
testifies,
“well,
i
suppose
i
would
have
to
answer,
yes,
segregation
is
perpetuated
thereby.”
and
on
108,
another
board
member
testifies
to
precisely
the
same
effect.
now,
in
the
davidson
county
case
where
there
is
evidence
of
experience
of
the
operation
of
the
plan,
mr.
garrett,
who's
the
director
of
child
welfare
and
attendance
testifies
on
--
i
believe
it
was
page
265
of
the
record.
and
a
little
earlier,
that
has
to
be
read
in
conjunction
with
something
earlier.
now,
how
many
children
--
on
256,
the
question
is
put
as
to
how
many
children
were
illegible
for
transfer?
and
the
answer
is
that
693,
that
is
405
negro
children
and
288
white
children.
and
the
evidence
is
quite
clear
that
only
51
of
the
negro
children
attended
the
white
schools
and
none
of
the
white
children
attended
the
negro
schools.
now,
that
evidence
as
to
the
white
children
does
not
appear
in
the
printed
record
but
is
on
page
52
of
the
transcript
of
the
record,
that
particular
portion
was
not
printed
in
this
court.
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
transfer
provision?
yes,
we
do
but
we
also
are
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
court
might
see
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
was
not
bad
on
its
face.
the
--
that's
the
sixth
circuit,
it
relied
on
the
kelley
case,
the
nashville
case
which
had
previously
approved
this
plan.
on
the
other
hand,
as
i
was
about
to
argue,
the
fifth
and
the
fourth
circuits
have
held
that
it
is
bad
on
its
face
and
the
sixth
circuit
as
i've
stated
relied
on
the
kelley
case.
now,
the
fifth
circuit
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
you
can
have
two
children
similarly
situated,
they
might
be
neighbors,
they
both
be
attending
the
same
school.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that's
one.
we
attack
this
on
three
separate
grounds.
on
that
ground
--
on
the
ground
that
this
is
state
enforcement,
school
board
enforcement
of
the
private
prejudice
of
an
individual
person,
and
on
the
ground
that
it
tend
to
perpetuate
segregation
within
the
system
but
we
attacked
it
in
three
different
way.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
(voice
overlap)
instead
of
rate,
that
was
a
misprint.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
school
--
you
see,
both
of
these
school
systems
had
had
two
sets
of
school
zones,
school
zones
for
negro
schools
and
school
zones
for
white
schools.
mr.
jack
greenberg
and
i'm
referring
to
it
in
that
way.
now,
when
the
zones
are
coalesced
as
they
are
in
a
stair-step
basis.
the
transfer
plan
contemplates
--
refers
to
schools
previously
for
whites
only
and
previously
for
negros
only.
and
that
is
just
the
way
of
saying
negro
and
white
schools.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
well,
that's
quite
commonly--
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
yes.
you
could
have
schools
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
is
typically
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
is
typically
the
way
that
school
segregation
is
made.
taking
either
two
sets
of
school
zones,
or
two
sets
of
bus
routes,
or
sometimes
two
sets
of
just
verbal
descriptions
but
somehow
rather
the
negro
children
have
to
be
told
which
negro
schools
they
go
to
and
the
white
children
have
to
be
told
which
white
schools
they
go
to.
and
those
are
the
separate
zones
and
they
inevitably
overlap.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
unless
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
but
a
negro
child
in
that
white
neighborhood,
if
he
live
there
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
it
occurs
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
this
--
nevertheless
the
school
zones
necessarily
as
a
matter
of
just
drafting
must
coincide
with
the
entire
boundaries
of
the
city.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
imagine
--
well,
they
always
do.
you
have
a
city
and
what
is
--
what
usually
happens
in
most
of
these
cases
if
you
look
at
the
records,
are
they're
just
two
maps.
well,
one
map
with
red
lines
and
green
lines.
that's
invariably
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that
issue
was
not
--
is
not
here
but
there
were
two
sets
of
school
zones.
in
fact,
the
plan
them
--
the
plan
itself
almost,
i
think,
refers
to
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
well,
the
contemplation,
these
old
zones
would
have
to
be
in
a
sense
maintained
because
no
one
would
know
what
school
they
formally
would
have
attended
except
under
the
obsolete
map
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
which
is
being
employed
for
the
purpose
of
the
transcript.
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
boson
case,
boson
against
rippy,
a
dallas
school
case,
in
referring
to
the
racial
transfer
plan
and
referring
to
the
kelley
case,
said
nevertheless
with
deference
to
the
views
of
the
sixth
circuit,
it
seems
to
us
the
classification
according
to
race
for
purposes
of
transfer
is
hardly
less
unconstitutional
than
such
classification
for
purposes
of
original
assignment
to
a
public
school.
and
then
it
quotes
from
the
language
in
yick
wo
against
hopkins
and
rather
in
hirabayashi
against
the
united
states,
they
quote
--
that
cites
they
quote.
now,
the
fourth
circuit
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
boson
versus
rippy.
that
it
--
a
dallas
school
case
and
that
is
at
285
f.2d
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
48.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
well,
the
--
it
was
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
and
the
fifth
circuit
addresses
itself
to
the
kelley
case
and
the
nashville
plan
saying
that
it
disagrees.
the
fourth
circuit
in
an
en
banc
opinion
by
judge
sofaer
in
the
charlottesville's
case,
dillard
versus
school
board
of
the
city
of
charlottesville
at
the
308
f.2d
at
923
of
that
opinion
states,
“it
is
of
no
significance
that
all
three
of
them
regardless
of
race
are
first
assigned
to
the
schools
in
the
residential
zone
and
all
are
permitted
to
transfer,
if
the
assignment
requires
the
child
to
attend
the
school
where
his
race
is
in
the
minority,
if
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
arrangement
is
to
retard
integration
and
retain
the
segregation
of
the
races,
that
this
purpose
in
this
effect
are
inherent
in
the
plan
can
hardly
be
denied.”
the
school
board
is
well
aware
that
most
of
the
negro
pupils
in
charlottesville
reside
in
the
jefferson
zone
and
that
under
the
operation
of
the
plan,
white
children
residents
therein
will
be
transferred
as
a
matter
of
course
to
the
schools
in
the
other
zones
while
the
colored
children
in
the
jefferson
zone
will
be
denied
of
this
privilege.
the
seeming
equality
of
the
language
is
delusive.
the
actual
effect
of
the
rule
is
unequal
and
discriminatory.
now,
in
two
cases
in
the
sixth
circuit,
district
court
cases,
the
district
judges
both
have
disagreed
with
the
sixth
circuit.
one
at
the
chattanooga
case
and
the
other
is
the
obion
county
case.
both
district
courts
have
--
notwithstanding
the
ruling
of
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
kelley
case,
they
agreed
with
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
boson
case.
one
of
those
cases
is
now
on
appeal
before
the
sixth
circuit,
and
it
has
not
yet
decided
it
and
the
other
case
has
not
been
appealed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
sir.
yes,
they
are.
at
least,
i
think
they
both
are.
now
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
we
have
a
three-fold
argument,
as
i
say.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
one
of
the
things
that
just
happened
in
connection
with
this
plan
is
that
there
hadn't
been
any
experience
with
attending
the
school
from
which
he
transfers
out.
the
transfer
is
all
paper
work
while
the
child
continues
to
reside
exactly
in
the
school
which
he
had
previously
been
attending.
our
position
is
that
if
this
general
transfer
plan,
general
transfer
that
go
into
the
footnote
were
in
fact
operated
in
a
way
to
achieve
the
same
result,
they
would
be
equally
bad.
and
in
fact,
that
brings
us
to
the
brief
with
the
city
of
knoxville
to
which
we've
referred
in
our
reply
brief.
knoxville
says,
“well,
we
don't
have
to
use
the
racial
transfer
plan.
we
can
use
the
general
transfer
plan
and
we'll
come
up
the
same
way.”
and
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
well
they
said,
“we'll
use
the
general
transfer
plan.
we'll
use
the
general
transfer
plan,
we'll
come
out
the
same
way.”
they
said
of
course
other
school
boards
may
not
be
staffed
and
equipped
to
do
it.
and
if
they
don't
have
to
do
it,
then
we
shouldn't
have
to
either.
that's
the
--
as
i
understand
their
argument.
our
feeling
is
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
we
don't
attack
them
in
general.
we
would
attack
them
if
they
were
used
in
fact
as
a
matter
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
well,
every
school
system
has
to
have
some
general
transfer
provisions
but
we
argue
on
our
reply
brief
that
it
would
be
most
dangerous
if
a
rule
were
approved
to
allow
general
transfer
to
actually
be
employed
when
race
is
the
real
reason
because
the
deliberate
speed
formula
necessarily
is
a
formula
that
requires
some
generality
and
most
of
the
segregation
that
is
being
maintained
in
the
face
of
the
brown
decision
is
being
maintained
under
other
labels
under
purporting
to
comply
with
the
deliberate
speed
formula.
now,
if
any
type
of
a
racial
factor
at
all
were
permitted
to
creep
into
that
and
i
think
the
court
has
been
very
careful
in
the
little
rock
opinion
and
in
the
brown
--
second
brown
decisions
to
exclude
any
racial
consideration.
if
any
type
of
racial
consideration
were
permitted
to
creep
into
it
the
possibilities
for
evasion
would
just
be
multiplied
almost
infinitely
and
we
would
submit
that
though
of
course
the
school
system
should
and
has
to
be
permitted
to
allow
transfer
in
general
grounds,
it
ought
not
to
under
any
circumstances
be
permitted
actually
to
take
race
into
account.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
to
some
extent,
it
certainly
is.
i
mean,
as
to
when
if
you
can't
assign
children
on
the
basis
of
race,
they
certainly
ought
not
to
be
able
to
transfer
on
the
basis
of
race.
this
is
a
racial
distinction
in
a
sort
of
secondary
school
assignment.
mr.
jack
greenberg
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
in
a
preliminary
way
indicated
earlier
i
think
the
three
different
responses
we
would
have
to
that
suggestion.
and
that
is
that
first
of
all,
this
is
a
racial
rule
which
has
been
set
down
by
the
state
and
by
virtue
of
this
racial
rule,
a
white
child
was
permitted
to
transfer
out
of
a
particular
situation
where
a
negro
child
identically
situated
except
for
race
is
not
permitted
to
transfer
out.
so
this
is
the
state
itself
imposing
a
racial
standard.
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
they
were
this
--
in
general,
if
they
--
under
a
general
type
of
transfer
provision.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
the
school
board
is
obligated
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
would
have
the
same
object
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
would
have
the
same
objection
if
this
child
when
to
the
school
board
and
said,
“look,
i
don't
want
to
go
to
this
school
because
these
children
are
of
the
other
race”,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
certainly.
mr.
jack
greenberg
was
certainly
that
and
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
no,
i
don't
feel
driven
to
it.
but
i
certainly
rely
in
it
and
i
feel
that
--
i
feel
this
--
this
is
unconstitutional
when
looked
at
from
a
variety
of
different
angles.
that
certainly
is
one
of
them.
another
way
of
looking
at
it
is
the
concept
in
naacp
v.
alabama.
it's
a
combination
of
private
and
state
action
which
achieves
a
discriminatory
result.
but
i
think
that
perhaps
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
i
would
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
and
perhaps
the
only
system
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
the
--
perhaps
the
only
school
system
that
i
know
of
that
permits
completely
voluntary
transfers
in
enrollment
is
in
baltimore
where
i
understand
that
traditionally
before
the
brown
decision,
there
were
two
separate
school
systems,
negro
and
white.
and
anyone
could
attend
any
school
that
he
wanted
and
it
worked
very
well.
it's
an
administrative
matter.
now,
after
the
brown
decision,
they
merely
took
race
out
of
it
and
anyone
is
--
been
permitted
to
attend
any
school
he
desires.
and
no
one
has
made
any
claim
that
particular
racial
proportions
in
particular
schools
may
or
may
not
be
unconstitutional.
that
issue
has
not
arisen.
but
here
is
a
place
where
you
have
maintained
segregation,
where
children
are
assigned
in
the
desegregated
grades
to
particular
schools
because
of
their
zone.
and
then
on
the
basis
of
race
are
permitted
to
transfer
or
refuse
permission
to
transfer
and
all
this
results
in
a
further
segregation
of
--
in
a
system,
in
other
words,
a
regression
to
the
prior
segregated
system.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
this
not
an
entirely
voluntary
school
system.
this
is
--
if
this
were
baltimore,
anyone
went
in
a
voluntary
basis.
but
this
is
a
place
where
a
negro
child
cannot
transfer
out
and
white
child
can
transfer
out.
so,
it's
not
voluntary.
it's
voluntary
in
a
sense
but
it's
state-enforced
in
the
sense
that
the
state
recognizes
this
and
implements
it.
and
this
tends
to
as
--
has
been
--
as
appears
in
the
record,
to
further
segregate
the
system.
in
fact,
what
happens
is,
that
as
white
children
transfer
out
of
a
particular
school,
the
school
zone
necessarily
must
be
expanded
to
complete
the
capacity
of
the
building
to
the
extent
that
negro
and
white
children
are
school
scooped
up
by
this
expansion
of
the
zone.
the
white
children
then
transfer
out
and
so
you
get
segregated
schools
with
greater
--
covering
greater
and
greater
areas.
and
indeed
that's
precisely
what
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
a
school
zone
is
set
up
of
so
many
square
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
all
grades.
mr.
jack
greenberg
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
let's
assume
a
school
in
which
negroes
are
in
the
majority,
60%
negro
and
40%
white.
all
those
white
children
can
and
in
fact
under
the
experience
of
this
plan
have
transferred
out
to
other
white
schools.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
the
negro
children
cannot
follow
those
white
children
because
they
are
in
a
school
in
which
their
race
is
in
the
majority.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
now,
the
negro
child
in
some
other
school
across
town
where
he
is
in
a
racial
minority,
he
may
transfer
back
to
some
colored
school.
this
gets
back
to
the
shelley
v.
kraemer
language
of
indiscriminate
imposition
of
inequalities.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
was
referring
to
shelley
in
a
--
from
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
in
a
different
kind
and
a
different
context.
but
the
negro
child
cannot
transfer
out
of
school
that
a
white
child
can
transfer
from.
now,
some
other
negro
child
and
some
other
school
might
be
able
to
transfer
out
but
this
individual
can't.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
doesn't
help
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
well,
and
this
tends
to
perpetuate
segregation
in
the
system
and
we
submit
that
the
brown
decision
equivocally
erred
when
we're
talking
about
school
system.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
your
right
is
the
right
to
go
to
school
in
a
desegregated
school
system,
not
the
right
of
a
particular
child
to
attend
a
particular
structure.
to
the
extent
that
these
plans
perpetuate
segregation
in
this
system,
we
feel
that
is
even
more
vicious
than
the
particular
denial
of
a
right
to
transfer
a
particular
child.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
--
no.
it
would
not
be
subject
to
this
criticism.
it
might
be
that
such
a
system
based
upon
a
prior
history
of
segregation
might
be
subject
to
criticism
that
this
has
not
necessarily
expunged
segregation
from
the
school
system
but
that's
not
involved
in
this
case
at
all.
but
certainly,
insofar
as
completely
free
transfers
were
permitted,
that
was
--
that's
not
this
case.these
are
racial
transfers.
there
is
some
effort
to
justify
this
plan
as
merely
temporary
and
transitional.
we
submit,
first
of
all,
the
record
does
not
support
that
at
all.
and
secondly,
even
if
it
were
temporary
and
transitional,
it
would
be
more
valid.
there
is
no
termination
date
for
this
type
of
plan,
there
is
no
standard
by
which
it
should
come
to
an
end.
there
is
no
statement
that
it
ends
at
the
end
of
12
years
and
in
fact
in
the
12-year
plan,
there
are
a
variety
of
provisions
which
obviously
on
their
very
face
are
not
meant
to
come
to
an
end
--
termination
of
12
years.
these
various
factors
are
first
of
all,
the
coalescence
of
the
zones,
that's
obviously
not
coming
to
an
end
at
the
end
of
12
years.
this
provision
as
to
bus
transportation,
that's
obviously
going
to
continue
and
provision
as
to
registration
in
the
spring
time.
now,
why
this
racial
transfer
thing
is
supposed
to
come
to
an
end
at
the
end
of
12
years
does
nowhere
appear
in
the
record.
but
transitional
or
permanent,
we
submit
that
its
equally
bad,
that
even
if
--
even
if
transitional,
it
would
have
to
be
supported
by
evidence
concerning
which
the
burden
would
be
on
the
respondent
and
they
presented
evidence
in
an
effort
to
support
the
12-year
aspect
to
the
plan
in
both
cases.
in
one
case
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
another
case
in
the
district
court
held
the
evidence
was
not
sufficient
if
they
had
made
an
effort
to
present
evidence.
if
they
had
evidence
here,
i
assume
they
would
have
presented
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
to
the
extent
that
they
were
asking
the
school
board
to
enforce
a
racial
decision
of
their
own.
mr.
jack
greenberg
what
i'm
saying
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
was.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
first
of
all,
as
a
preliminary
matter,
there
were
no
actual
transfer
there,
but
he
actually
stated
that
there
were.
there
was
just
a
lot
of
paperwork.
but
i
would
assume,
if
they
came
in,
the
superintendent
or
some
administrative
official
say,
“why
do
you
want
to
transfer?”
and
they
would
say,
“well,
for
this
racial
reason.”
you
have
--
they
weren't
terribly
sorry,
we're
not
permitted
to
enforce
racial
choices
here
in
the
city
of
knoxville.
someone
came
in,
he
wants
to
transfer
because
there's
too
long
a
trip
or
because
of
some
other
reason
he
might
acquiesce
on
that
under
nonracial
standard.
but
he
just
had
to
say
segregation
is
no
longer
permitted
here
and
--
in
any
particular
form.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
to
the
extent
that
it
means
the
use
of
the
government
system
and
exempts
that
the
government
is
invoked.
well,
i
wouldn't
say
the
government
is
affirmed
to
--
be
required
to
deny
it
in
a
transaction
which
the
government
is
not
involve.
but,
in
a
school
system
of
course,
i
don't
see
how
you
could
escape
from
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
say
--
i
would
have
to
note
that.
i
assume
that
there'd
be
certain
considerations
of
privacy
involved
there
which
i
think
would
have
countervailing
constitutional
weight
and
might
be
taken
into
account
in
arriving
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
of
course
they
can
send
their
children
to
private
schools
and
they
can't
be
compelled
to
attend
the
public
schools
but
to
the
extent
they
do
attend
the
public
schools
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
to
the
extent
that
they
are
in
the
public
school
system,
i
don't
believe
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
they
can
require
that
school
system
to
enforce
their
personal
prejudice
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
they
come
in
and
they
say,
“look,
i'd
like
to
transfer.”
and
the
superintendent
says,
“why?”
and
they
say,
“because
i
don't
like
these
negro
children.”
mr.
jack
greenberg
you
just
have
to
say,
“well,
i'm
terribly
sorry.
we're
not
permitted
to
do
that.”
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
yes,
yes.
i'm
terribly
sorry,
you
have
to
go
to
a
public
school
and
we
can
enforce
racial
standards.
mr.
jack
greenberg
who
would
waive?
you
mean
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
say
--
i
would
say
that
of
course
you
always
could
reach
a
case
where
the
plight
of
an
individual
child
was
such
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
say
that
the
superintendent
would
have
to
say
to
him
that
we
can't
recognize
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
because
he
would
be
--
he
would
be
enforcing
this
private
prejudice
in
addition
to
which
in
the
context
of
this
plan
it
would
be
further
segregating
the
system.
that
is,
in
fact,
i
would
operate
and
it
was
adopted
in
contemplation
of
the
fact
that
it
would
operate
that
way.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
would
be
the
obligation
of
the
school
system
to
attempt
some
other
means
to
remedy
that
situation
which
i
would
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
but
this
particular
plan
and
that
we
now
have
before
us
does
not
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
but
does
not
permit
a
white
--
a
negro
child
to
attend
a
white
school
because
he
was
talking
about
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
assume
my
argument
would
be
the
same,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
assume
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
in
these
few
minutes,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
stewart
concerning
our
view
of
the
scope
of
the
brown
decision.
in
our
view,
the
brown
decision
means
that
there
shall
be
no
racial
distinctions
whatsoever
in
a
school
system.
the
right
of
the
child
is
the
right
to
attend
a
system
without
race
in
assignment,
transfer,
employment
of
personnel
and
so
forth,
a
system
free
of
race.
now,
this
is
an
issue
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
--
the
school
is
--
the
school
system
is
merely
compelled
not
to
impose
any
racial
distinction.
now,
if
in
the
unique
case
of
baltimore
for
example,
which
other
systems
for
obvious
reasons
find
difficult
to
adopt,
where
people
go
to
school
completely
as
a
matter
of
their
own
choice,
that's
one
thing
but
everywhere
else
where
there
are
standards
for
attending
school
and
assigning
the
teachers
and
so
forth,
this
must
be
done
without
regard
to
race.
now,
this
has
been
a
subject
of
a
great
deal
of
litigation
in
the
courts
of
appeals
in
pupil
assignment
cases.
pupil
assignment
cases
arise
out
of
children
being
assigned
to
school
on
the
basis
of
race
and
then
given
an
opportunity
to
transfer
presumably
without
regard
to
race.
after
a
great
deal
of
litigation,
the
courts
of
appeals
are
all
in
unanimous
agreement,
the
fourth,
fifth,
sixth,
and
eighth
circuits,
appear
to
agree
that
the
right
of
the
child
is
the
right
to
attend
a
system
without
regard
to
race
and
therefore
as
in
the
holland
case
in
florida
in
the
fifth
circuit,
a
negro
child
who
lives
close
to
a
negro
school
which
if
it
were
to
be
desegregated,
the
system
were
to
be
desegregated
would
still
be
a
school
entirely
composed
of
negro
students.
and
would
be
the
school
he
would
attend
because
it's
near
him,
has
a
right
to
bring
a
suit
to
desegregate
the
system
because
his
right
is
not
to
attend
a
particular
structure
or
to
be
in
company
with
any
particular
students
but
to
go
to
school
in
a
system
that
has
no
racial
considerations
or
distinctions
attached
to
any
of
the
various
phases
of
its
operation.
and
i
could
cite
the
cases
in
our
--
in
our
brief
but
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
that
is
not
what
we're
urging
and
that
is
not
our
view.
our
view
is
that
in
no
racial
distinctions
in
the
system
and
as
i
say
it
has
come
up
in
pupil
assignment
cases
which
you
are
sort
of
the
adverse
of
this,
but
all
of
the
circuits
in
the
cases
of
the
wheeler
and
jeffer's
case
in
the
fourth
circuit,
most
recently
an
unreported
case
in
the
fifth,
potts
versus
flax.
in
the
sixth
circuit,
the
north
worth's
case
and
in
the
eighth
circuit
the
little
rock
in
delaware
school
cases,
all
unanimously
agree
with
this
view.
and
consequently
a
transfer
system
which
had
a
racial
standard
as
a
part
of
it
is
a
violation
of
that
teaching
of
brown.
now,
there
was
--
i
perhaps
didn't
make
myself
clear
yesterday,
though
i
think
our
view
on
the
right
of
the
individual
child
who
may
be
disturbed
but
whose
education
may
be
affected
by
attending
a
particular
school.
the
question
that
mr.
justice
brennan
among
others
ask,
i
believe,
our
view
on
that
is
clearly
expressed
in
our
reply
brief,
where
we
discussed
that
situation.
and
our
view
on
that
is
that
no
child
should
be
permitted
to
transfer
because
of
a
racial
desire,
because
of
a
desire
not
to
go
to
school
with
members
of
another
race.
the
school
board
cannot
recognize
that
under
a
matter
of
practice
or
under
explicit
terms
of
the
plan.
and
--
but
however,
if
a
child
had
clinical
problems
or
educational
problems
because
of
such
a
situation
we
would
be
punitive
about
it
and
insist
that
that
particular
disturbed
child
must
stay
in
that
situation,
whether
it's
good
for
him
or
not,
that
of
course
is
not
this
case.
we
don't
face
that
problem
here
at
this
time
but
in
recognizing
that
such
exceptional
circumstances
might
be
proper
grounds
for
a
transfer,
we
respectfully
submit
that
such
a
rule
if
it
were
to
be
discussed
in
opinion,
should
not
open
the
door
to
evasion
with
such
a
rule
possibly
might
do.
because
as
--
as
the
knoxville
--
knoxville
brief
has
indicated
and
his
argument
here
today
has
indicated,
it
is
quite
easy
as
a
matter
of
course
to
merely
assume
that
this
situation
exists.
and
to
freely
allow
transfers
on
what
purports
to
be
an
individual
clinical
evaluation
than
what
is
merely
a
racial
standard.
and
we
would
submit
that
all
other
reasonable
avenues
of
exhausting
the
situation
of
solving
the
problem,
first,
should
be
exhausted.
and
that
the
burden
of
proof
in
such
a
case
should
be
a
heavy
one,
but
nevertheless,
certainly
in
the
last
analysis
no
one
would
insist
that
a
child
be
compelled
to
attend
the
school
if
it
were
to
be
quite
clear
detriment
of
his
education.
