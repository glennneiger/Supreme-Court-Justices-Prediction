i
don't
--
you
mean
that's
this
--
this
can't
be
weighed?
ordinarily
constitutional,
you
just
waive
constitutional
rights,
aren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

if
a
colored
parent
says,
“our
child
isn't
doing
as
well
here
and
the
reason
he
is
not
doing
well
here
is
his
unhappy
with
these
white
children
in
the
school.
so
we
want
to
transfer.”
and
you're
saying
the
principal
would
have
to
say
to
him,
“this
is
not
--
this
case
--
the
principal
would
have
to
say,
“no.”
if
that's
your
ground
for
wanting
to
make
your
child
more
comfortable,
namely
that
he
can't
get
along
with
the
white
children
here,
i
can't
let
you
do
it.
you've
got
to
stay
here.
that's
what
he
was
telling,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
let's
take
the
--
let's
take
the
case
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
do
you
say
that's
prejudice,
mr.
greenberg?
here's
a
colored
parent
whose
child
isn't
getting
along
well
in
this
school
with
white
children
and
the
parents'
judgment
is
that
the
child
will
do
better
if
he
transfers
to
another
school
and
he
tells
the
principal
that.
why
--
what
prejudice
is
it
being
for?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
wiser.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'd
suppose
you'd
say,
mr.
marshall,
that
those
white
children
and
their
parents
could
equally
maintain
an
action,
if
they
cared
to,
challenging
these
transfer
provisions
on
the
same
constitutional
ground
of
discrimination.
what
happened
in
the
case
you
have
is
on
behalf
of
negro
children,
who
complained
of
the
discrimination
as
against
them,
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
follow
this,
mr.
marshall.
i
was
discussing
this
with
mr.
greenberg
yesterday
as
we
close
last
evening.
do
i
understand
this
now
at
least
it's
the
government's
position
that
in
baltimore,
where
as
i
understand
it,
the
transfer
provisions
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
race?
there
are
other
considerations
which
may
prevent
the
transfer
or
not.
but
assuming
that
those
transfer
provisions
could
be
satisfied
in
the
transfer,
otherwise
we
permit
it.
negro
parents
who
come
to
the
school
principal
and
say,
“our
child
is
not
happy
here.
we
don't
think
the
child
is
doing
well
here.
we
think
the
child
will
do
better
if
he
transfers
to
this
other
school
where
the
children
are
largely
negro.
and
it's
because
of
this,
because
they're
largely
negro,
we
want
to
transfer
the
child.”
i
gather
your
position
would
be
that
the
principal
could
not
say
to
the
parents,
“well,
even
though
you
satisfy
all
the
other
requirements
of
the
transfer
and
the
transfer
is
permissible
because
you
tell
me
you're
putting
on
a
racial
ground,
i
can't
allow
the
transfer.”
you
would
not
go
to
that
far?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
greenberg
took
a
different
position
yesterday.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
something.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
this
suggest
the
fact
that
a
negro
child
in
a
school
where
negro
children
are
in
the
majority,
he
has
requested
to
transfer
to
another
school
have
been
granted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
fowler
may
i
ask
what
you
told
us
about
the
current
approach
you
think
to
rule
5.
what
possible
service
can
rule
6
know?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
had
been
--
then
i
gather
no
consideration
at
least
to
knoxville
with
the
leading
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
the
leading
rule
6.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
has
been
none?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
there
has
been?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
decided
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
that
would
be
with
47
units?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
unit
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
a
school,
i
gather?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
unit
is
a
school.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
okay.
