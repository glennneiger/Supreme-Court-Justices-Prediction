mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
nominally,
i
am
appearing
here
today
on
behalf
of
the
school
board
of
davidson
county,
tennessee.
i
say
nominally
because
actually
today
there
is
no
school
board
at
davidson
county,
tennessee.
in
the
latter
part
of
1962
and
subsequent
to
the
time
that
this
petition
was
acted
upon,
we
had
what
is
defined
in
tennessee
as
a
metropolitan
government
election.
and
we
are
now
operating
a
unified
government
between
the
city
of
nashville
and
davidson
county
with
the
result
that
as
of
now,
we
have
a
combined
school
board.
i
make
that
observation
because
actually
some
of
the
figures
that
would
appear
in
this
record
would
not
be
exactly
applicable
today.
we
would
have
to
consider
this
more
a
combination
of
the
maxwell
case
and
the
kelley
case
in
order
to
get
it
in
its
proper
perspective.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
there
has
been
no
substitution
of
parties.
we
have
made
no
suggestion
about
that.
i
offer
it
not
with
that
particular
emphasis
but
rather
to
show
that
it's
a
combination
of
those
two
cases.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
same
system
--
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
correct.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
yes,
and
we're
confronted
with
the
larger
difficulty
than
we
would
have
been
have
we
made
davidson
county.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
submit
three
preliminary
propositions
before
going
to
the
immediate
question
that
we
have,
i
think
these
bear
upon
it.
in
the
first
place,
when
we
were
instructed
by
the
district
court
to
formulate
zones,
school
zones,
neighborhood
zones,
whatever
they'd
be
called,
without
regard
to
race
they
were
so
formulated.
there
was
no
gerrymandering
in
them.
there
has
been
no
charge
of
any
gerrymandering
in
them.
those
are
fair
zones
we
submit,
they
are
zones
based
upon
population
and
school
facility
and
nothing
else.
secondly,
may
it
please
the
court,
in
these
cases,
on
the
question
that
has
been
brought
up
by
this
court,
i
respectfully
submit
that
we
are
required
to
discuss
it
in
that.
and
i
say
that
because
there
is
no
individual
before
this
court,
or
no
one
in
a
class
before
this
court
as
an
individual,
who
has
asked
other
relief
is
being
sought
here.
there
has
been
no
negro
child
who
has
asked
to
be
transferred
out
of
a
school
and
had
been
denied.
there
has
been
no
white
child
ask
to
be
transferred
out
of
or
into
a
school
and
then
denied.
and
so
i
submit
that
we
must
consider
this
case
in
a
vacuum
because
there
is
no
party
before
the
court.
no
justiciable
controversy
or
issue
as
to
any
person.
and
may
it
please
the
court
well
--
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
no,
there
has
been
no
request.
upon
this,
there
has
been
no
request
and
therefore
we
do
not
know
and
we
have
to
discuss
it
in
a
vacuum
whether
under
number
five
as
compressed
with
number
six,
he
might
have
been
so
granted.
we
have
to
discuss
this
case
in
vacuum
and
not
in
fact.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
i
would
not
say
that
it
is
a
mandatory
transfer
plan,
may
it
please
the
court
and
i
definitely
with
the
petitioners
on
there.
i
say
that
those
are
matters
which
may
be
considered
as
valid
calls
for
transfer
going
back
to
number
five.
number
five
says
that
upon
good
cause,
now
then
here
are
some
of
the
reasons
that
the
school
board
may
consider
as
good
cause.
now,
frankness
requires
me
to
admit
that
administratively
up
to
this
point,
yes
it
has
been
considered
by
the
school
board
as
good
cause.
they
have
granted
each
one
of
these
requests
because
it
has
not
created
yet
an
administrative
problem
to
refuse
or
not
refuse.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
there's
no
question.
that
was
true
under
the
city
system
and
we
put
that
proof
into
record
in
our
case.
it
was
what
they
proposed
to
do
under
the
knoxville
system.
it
was
what
they
proposed
to
do
under
the
davidson
county
system
until
such
time
as
it
did
become
an
administrative
problem
then
it
would
have
you
discontented.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
from
the
school
board's
point
of
view?
yes.
you
might
have
overcrowding
in
one
school
by
transfer
--
permitting
to
transfer
out
of
one
zone
into
the
next
zone.
when
the
zones
have
been
created
based
upon
two
things,
the
population
within
the
zone
and
the
facility
to
accommodate
it.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
so
you
might
end
up
with
a
situation
where
you
have
vacant
school
and
an
overflowing
school.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
i
would
say
it
would
be
good
cause
if
they
decide
to
go
to
an
integrated
school
and
not
to
remain
in
a
school
which
was
in
fact
all
of
one
race
was
affecting
the
educational
opportunity
of
that
child.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
do
qualify
--
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
the
school
board
has
not
adopted
it.
we
have
never
been
asked
to
adopt
it.
we
have
never
been
asked
to
rule
upon
it
and
we've
never
been
presented
with
a
child
asking
that
particular
relief
or
a
parent.
so
that
in
fact,
may
it
please
the
court,
in
addition
to
representing
the
school
board,
i
am
representing
here
today
354
negro
students
and
288
white
students
in
the
davidson
county
system.
the
354
being
out
of
a
total
of
405,
who
were
affected
when
the
zoning
plan
was
placed
in
it,
all
of
whom
desired
for
reasons
that
was
satisfactory
to
themselves
feeling
that
the
effect
of
being
any
racial
minority
might
have
upon
the
education
of
their
children,
were
permitted
to
move
to
another
school.
i'm
representing
their
rights
just
as
well
as
i'm
representing
a
school
board
here,
may
it
please
the
court.
because
i
submit
that
the
basic
--
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
officially
represent
--
that's
my
paying
client,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
no,
if
the
court
please,
i'm
representing
their
interest
however
--
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
because
unless
the
position
that
we
take
is
sustained
they
would
not
have
had
--
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
i
have
not
been
employed
by
any
of
that.
i
would
not
--
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
i
haven't
had
any
of
those
yet,
if
the
court
please.
we
haven't
had
that
situation
--
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
no
sir,
i
have
not
because
we
have,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
not
had
the
request
yet.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
no,
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
says
that
under
number
five,
other
things
may
be
considered
as
good
cause.
but
under
number
six,
that
these
things
which
are
defined
may
be
considered
as
valid
reasons
by
the
board
and
they
are
about
a
board
and
they
are
spelled
out
but
it
does
not
say
that
there
are
not
others
which
may
be
considered.
and
we
have
not
had
the
application
or
the
request
yet.
and
i
do
not
know
what
the
school
board
would
do
with
such
an
application
or
request.
and
the
superintendent
in
the
davidson
system
so
stated
that
he
didn't
know
what
would
happen.
we
were
not
dealing
with
that.
we
have
had
no
request.
if
the
court
please,
i
think
these
all
points
to
what
i
submit
is
a
basic
fallacy
in
the
position
taken
by
the
petitioners
and
by
the
mixture
of
the
government
and
that
is
this.
an
assignment
is
made
by
the
school
board.
a
child
is
assigned
to
a
school
by
the
school
board
with
total
disregard
to
race,
it's
based
strictly
upon
zones
which
have
not
been
challenged
and
which
are
not
based
upon
race.
there
is
a
difference
between
an
assignment
by
a
school
board
of
a
child
to
a
particular
school
and
the
permission
by
the
school
board
of
that
child
to
transfer
upon
the
request
of
the
parent
who
is
first
charged
with
the
educational
welfare
of
that
child.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
submit
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
go
to
the
proposition
of
the
assignment
of
children
and
not
to
the
proposition
of
what
parents
may
request
in
the
school
board
on
me.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
that
the
parent
may
rely
upon
or
use,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
if
and
i
have
to
qualify,
if
you
must,
the
parent
want
to
rely
upon.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
that
we
are
all
in
agreement
that
the
operation
of
the
law,
segregation
by
operation
of
law
is
no
longer
a
part
and
can
no
longer
be
a
part
of
the
public
educational
system
since
the
brown
decisions.
give
some
thought
to
many
lawyers
and
i
believe
some
of
the
courts,
prior
to
that
that
converse
was
true
but
all
of
us
recognize
that
now
to
be
the
law.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court,
i'll
have
to
answer
that
question
with
two
answers.
first,
a
practical
answer
and
the
other
one
a
theoretical
answer,
as
a
practical
answer
and
insofar
as
davidson
county
is
concerned
we
did
it
because
that
was
the
rule
that
have
been
charted
out
through
us
by
the
district
court,
have
been
approved
by
the
circuit
court
of
the
sixth
circuit
which
is
our
circuit
and
certiorari
have
been
denied
by
this
court
and
we
felt
that
here
in
this
same
community
--
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
we
were
not
required
to
follow
those
decisions,
no.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
no,
no,
we
were
not
required
to.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
as
the
second
and
the
theoretical
reason,
and
this
is
the
theoretical
reason
that
was
originally
included
was
because
we
felt
that
no
parent
should
be
required
to
wait,
to
see
whether
there
was
an
emotional
or
psychological
impact
which
was
affecting
adversely
the
educational
advancement
of
the
child
before
being
permitted
to
remove
it
from
one
school
to
another
school,
we
felt
that
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
we
should
permit
in
advance
as
a
preventative
if
the
parent
was
concerned
about
it.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
now,
if
the
court
please,
now
here,
i
wanted
to
comment
on
that,
here's
exactly
what
happened
about
that.
the
notice
was
sent
out
and
i'm
looking
at
page
249
and
250
of
the
record.
the
notice
was
actually
set
out
to
every
county
by
their
child
where
they
were
in
a
situation
that
the
new
zoning
required
them
to
transfer,
required
them
be
assigned
on
another
school.
and
it
starts
off
in
the
notice,
in
the
transfer
request
and
it
says
school
zone
in
which
you
lived,
in
other
words
this
is
where
you
are
now
zoned,
in
accordance
with
the
notice
which
is
on
249.
this
is
the
one
in
which
you
are
now
zoned.
here
is
the
school
which
you
are
now
attending.
now
unless
that
child
brought
this
notice
back
saying,
i
do
not
want
to
be
moved
over
and
then
moved
back,
i
do
not
want
to
be
moved
over
then
you
would
stay
in
that
location.
now
the
practical,
the
administrative
reason
for
that
that
is
that
you
didn't
actually
physically
take
the
child
from
the
school
that
he
was
now
attending,
to
the
school
to
which
it
was
assigned
and
then
let
the
child
transfer
back
into
school
to
which
he
was
assigned,
to
the
school
that
he
had
formally
been
attending
if
that's
the
school
he
wanted
to
go
to,
was
that
you
would
have
the
paperwork
of:
number
one,
the
child
turning
in
the
books;
number
two,
the
child's
transfer
papers
with
the
state
going
over
to
the
assigned
school
then
the
transfer
papers
again
being
made
out
about
what
the
state
rules
and
all
of
these
appears
in
the
record
to
bring
that
child
back
to
the
other
school
and
books
reassigned.
it
just
created
administrative
problems
there
that
accomplished
the
same
result.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
so
far
it
has
been,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
up
until
now
there
has
not
been
--
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
we
have
had
no
administrative
problems
to
arise
from
the
transfers
after
we
have
permitted.
now
if
it
would
create
adminis
--
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
none,
not
until
now.
may
it
please
the
court,
we
have
felt
that
the
--
the
reasoning
that
was
adopted
by
mr.
justice
mcallister
in
the
kelley
case
was
clear
reasoning
and
cautious
reasoning.
now,
i
must
confess
that
i
think
most
members
of
the
bar
would
admit
that
when
they
agree
with
reasoning
they
then
think
it's
very
clear
and
very
cautious.
but
we
do
submit
that
the
grounds
upon
which
he
based
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
as
respects
this
plan
which
was
adopted,
which
was
our
guidepost
that
we
have
followed,
that
they
are
basic
reasons
and
they
are
sound
reasons.
first,
that
this
court
had
not
decided
and
has
not
yet
decided
that
the
states
must
deprive
persons
of
the
right
to
choose
what
schools
they
attend
but
rather
all
they
have
decided
is
that
a
state
may
not
deny
to
a
person
on
account
of
race,
the
right
to
attend
any
school
it
maintains.
and
that
two,
if
those
schools
which
it
maintains
are
open
to
the
children
of
all
races,
with
the
zone
limitation
of
course
which
is
a
practical
limitation
that
was
recognized
in
the
brown
cases,
that
if
the
schools
which
it
maintains
are
open
to
the
children
of
all
races
then
there's
no
violation
of
the
constitution.
although
the
children
of
different
races
may
in
fact
attend
different
schools.
and
finally,
that
there
was
no
evidence
there
in
the
sixth
circuit
as
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
in
either
the
maxwell
or
goss
cases
that
the
transfer
plan
is
any
evasive
scheme
concocted
in
order
to
bring
about
or
continue
segregation.
if
the
child
was
free
to
attend
an
integrated
school
which
by
integrated,
i
mean
integrated
in
fact
and
if
the
parents
voluntarily
chose
to
move
that
child
from
that
school
to
another
school,
that
then
the
child
was
not
being
deprived
of
its
constitutional
rights
or
to
put
it
in
another
way.
and
i'm
now
leaving
the
reasoning
of
mr.
justice
mcallister.
if
this
plan
excluding
the
transfer
provision,
excluding
number
six,
if
this
plan
is
signed
then
we
submit
that
number
six
takes
nothing
from
it
because
it
is
the
individual
acting
either
as
an
individual
or
through
its
parents,
and
not
the
state
which
makes
the
election.
and
insofar
as
the
state
or
the
school
board
here
is
concerned,
no
child
is
prevented
from
attending
a
particular
school
because
of
his
or
her
race.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
i
think
that
is
true,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
but
he's
prevented
because
he
is
moving
out
of
a
zone
which
was
determined
without
regard
to
race
and
he
is
not
granted
a
transfer
request.
but
no
school
is
denied
to
him
because
of
his
race,
because
he
was
put
here,
he
was
placed
in
this
school
because
of
the
zone.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
if
the
are
--
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
yes,
because
of
a
racial
note.
that
is
correct.
now
--
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
because
we
had
not
anticipated
and
we
do
not
anticipate
that
in
an
area,
where
you
have
this
deep-seated
custom
that
has
been
there
for
so
many
years,
that
you
are
going
to
have
the
emotional
impact
which
would
affect
the
educational
opportunities
of
the
child
or
the
educational
advancement
of
the
child,
because
of
a
desire
to
go
to
a
school,
where
the
races
are
mixed.
now,
if
you
do
have
it
then
the
school
board
may
consider
it.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
feel
that
we
are,
i
feel
rather
--
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
i
think
there
is
a
difference
between
segregation-minded
and
what
is
the
--
what
has
been
the
custom
that
would
have
an
effect
upon
children,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
well,
we've
--
it's
been
indicated
that
they
don't
because
so
far
we
have
had
no
request
and
this
record
would
indicate
no
such
request.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
we
are
recognizing
it.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
but
we
say
that
under
the
plan
he
is
not
prevented
from
doing
it
but
he
must
come
in
without
--
and
not
just
have
that
and
nothing
more,
he
must
then
show
to
us.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
no,
i'd
say
he
can
put
it
on
the
basis
of
race
and
the
desire
--
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
i
will.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
we
are
referring
now
to
the
knoxville
school
board
and
mr.
fowler
--
that's
mr.
fowler's
school
board
and
i
would
asked
that
he'd
be
permitted
to
respond
to
that
rather
than
me
if
it's
satisfactory
with
the
justice
because
it
does
exempt
the
goss
case
and
not
in
the
actual
case,
although
they
have
been
consolidated.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
in
davidson
county,
at
the
time
this
went
into
effect
in
1960
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
that's
what
i'm
talking
about,
non-city
part
of
the
county.
the
county
system
had
44,415
white
students,
2348
negro
students
or
a
total
of
46,763.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
44,000
to
2,000.
now,
the
city
system
as
of
that
time,
with
which
we've
been
now
of
course
consolidated
had
17,372
white
and
12,850
or
17
to
12.
now,
as
evidence
we
submit
that
this
plan
has
not
had
the
effect
of
continuing
segregation
is
the
fact
that
when
the
city
plan
went
into
effect,
approximately
10%
of
those
affected
state
in
mix
schools
and
90%
moved
out.
the
government
has
cited
in
its
brief
the
fact
that
in
a
five-year
period
that
percentage
has
gone
from
10%
to
20%
or
has
doubled
in
this
five-year
period.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
who
did
not
move
out,
that's
right.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
as
of
now
--
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
just
davidson
county?
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
as
of
this
school
year,
there
are
115
--
185.
i'm
sorry
110
last
year,
185
started
out
with
51
now
185
in
a
two-year
span
or
it's
molded
correctly.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
that's
negroes
in
schools
where
there
are
students
of
both
races,
yes.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
choice
maybe
made
each
year.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
that
is
correct,
may
it
please
the
court
and
if
it
there
is
a
reason
for
that,
you
see
there's
a
reason
for
the
fact
that
it
was
so
small
those
remaining
the
first
year
in
my
opinion
and
that's
because
we
did
this
as
of
january
1
rather
than
at
the
beginning
of
the
school
year.
and
i
personally
would
not
have
permitted
any
child
of
mine
to
transfer
and
so
many
parents
feel
that
way
during
a
school
year
and
it's
something
that
the
schools
have
recognized
because
if
you
move
out
the
zone
during
the
school
year
they
do
not
require
you
to
move
to
another
school.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
would
be
an
accurate
statement
but
of
course
when
there
--
when
you
have
negroes
in
a
mixed
--
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
no,
may
it
please,
but
they
haven't.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
are
just
--
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
i
think
he's
talking
about
the
actual
means
that
we're
using,
that
were
used
originally
for
signing
a
pupil
and
then
permitting
the
pupil
to
transfer.
we
did
do
it
by
paper,
that's
all
a
transfer
ever
is
in
the
school
system
plus
the
physical
fact
of
making
you
turn
in
your
books
here
and
go
for
this
and
take
a
seat
and
then
being
transferred
back
and
coming
back
over
here
and
getting
the
new
set
of
school
books.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
actually
transferred
only
by
paper,
not
actually
physically
transferred
as
i
say
we
did
not
go
through
the
useless
task
of
those
who
were
in
school
a
and
by
virtue
of
the
zoning
were
required
to
go
school
b.
but
through
their
parents
requested
that
they'd
be
permitted
to
stay
in
school
a
or
transfer
from
b
to
a.
we
did
not
require
them
to
physically
go
from
a
to
b
and
then
back
to
a.
that
is
not
here.
(voice
overlap)
that's
what
he
has
referred
to
as
a
paper
transfer.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
but
the
figures
that
i'm
giving
are
people
who
actively,
physically
moved.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
now,
i
have
not
had
the
opportunity
to,
may
it
please
the
court,
to
discuss
the
transitional
phase
of
this
plan.
we
do
feel
on
behalf
of
our
school
board
that
it's
transitional,
we
think
that's
what
the
district
court
found
when
he
added
to
the
decree
that
it
was
retained
in
court.
we
think
it's
what
the
circuit
court
found
because
they
rebut
that
but
i
am
sure
that
that
will
be
discussed
by
mr.
fowler,
representing
the
knoxville
school
board
since
it
pertains
to
both.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
no
def
--
no
material
deference.
i
think
their
two
words
deference
but
they
have
material
words.
mr.
k.
harlan
dodson,
jr.
that
is
correct.
