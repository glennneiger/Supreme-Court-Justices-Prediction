you
mean
that
mr.
greenberg
--
you're
saying
that
the
transfer
will
--
you
mean,
was
automatically
be
provided?
justice
potter
stewart
the
city
of
nashville
plan
is
--
it
was
something
as
a
third
plan
or
at
least
the
third
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
say
that
that's
--
they're
going
to
operate
it
(voice

is

around

isn't
it?
justice

stewart
suburban
area
around
nashville.
justice
potter
stewart
and
do
i
understand
that
the
transfer
provisions
found
in
the
footnotes
--
well,
found
in
the
footnotes,
footnote
2
on
page
4
of
your
brief,
are
an
addition
to
these
--
this
other
--
this
other
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
attacking
those
that
appear
in
--
on
footnote
2?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
--
maybe
you've
pointed
this
out
in
your
errata
that
the
last
word
under
subsection
c
on
page
4
of
your
brief
should
be
race
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
when
you
talk
about
the
white
schools
and
negro
schools,
this
is
shorthand
for
talking
about
schools
which
should
be
--
which
formally
were
all
white
or
formally
were
all
negro,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
what
you
mean
when
you
say
negro
school
or
white
school
as
you
said
in
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand
the
two
sets
of
school
zones.
does
this
mean
they
were
overlapping?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
same
block?
justice
potter
stewart
assuming
a
mixed
neighborhood
on
the
same
block,
you
--
you
probably
had
one
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

next
to
each
other,
one
--
or
one
zone
--
school
zone
or
one
on
the
other
depending
upon
the
race
of
the
family
living
in
the
house?
justice
potter
stewart
and
at
least
in
certain
cases
on
--
i
supposed
there
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
cases
where
--
entirely
a
white
neighborhood
where
they
don't
know
it
overlaps,
or
an
entirely
negro
neighborhood
with
a
school
in
the
neighborhood.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
assuming
--
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
assuming
that
there
is
no
negro
child
there.
in
other
words,
that
it's
completely
a
white
neighborhood.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
record
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
issue
--
i
mean
this
had
--
it
does
have
to
do
with
the
issue
which
is
here,
which
is
the
request
for
transfer
from
--
why
a
white
student
to
go
to
what
was
formally
an
all
white
school
and
by
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
colored
student
to
go
to
what
was
formally
an
all
negro
school.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
this
plan
--
come
in.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
judge
mcallister's
opinion
in
the
kelley
case
involved
the
nashville
plan.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
virtually
identical
of
these
two.
justice
potter
stewart
that
these
two
are
copies.
justice
potter
stewart
those
are
both
cited
in
your
brief
mr.
greenberg?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
don't
attack
these
general
provisions
here.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
would
be
another
case,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
some
future
case
there.
justice
potter
stewart
but
do
you
suggest
mr.
greenberg
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
brown
versus
board
of
education?
justice
potter
stewart
would
it
be
fair
or
would
it
be
correct
or
not
in
your
opinion
to
say
that
the
--
what
was
fundamentally
decided
in
brown
against
board
of
education
was
that
a
public
school
or
school
system
could
not
keep
children
out
be
--
based
upon
the
color
of
their
skins?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
basic
decision
in
this.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
this
has
to
do
with
space
at
least
with
what
individual,
private
individuals
affirmatively
want
to
do.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
nothing
in
brown
against
board
of
education
that
said
that
any
given
public
school
had
to
have
a
integrated
student
body,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
nothing
at
all.
it
simply
said
that
a
public
school
could
not
keep
out
a
student
who
is
otherwise
qualified
merely
because
of
the
color
of
his
skin.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
didn't
say
that
a
--
any
school
system
had
to
integrate
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
or
to
have
a
mix
of
the
student
body
from
the
point
of
your
race.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
happens
only
upon
the
voluntary
affirmative
wish
of
private
individuals,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
sure
that
i
fully
--
i'm
unable
to
i
guess,
that
a
white
child
can
transfer
out
and
a
negro
child
cannot,
out
of
what,
referring
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
page
4,
just
referring
to
the
provisions,
i'd
--
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
you.
a
says
that
a
white
student
can
transfer
out
of
--
otherwise
be
required
to
attend
a
school
which
was
formerly
serving
colored
students
only.
and
b
says
that
a
colored
student
can
transfer
out
if
he
is
otherwise
be
required
to
attend
a
school
formerly
serving
white
students
only.
and
c
is
--
as
to
the
--
with
the
majority
school
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
--
and
a
student
of
either
race
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
could
buy
the
advantage
of
that.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
where
is
the
racial
discrimination
there?
justice
potter
stewart
both
--
all
the
negro
children
could
do
the
same
thing
if
it
(inaudible)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
where
it
does,
gets
you
as
my
brother
white
suggested,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
a
more
different
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
a
white
child
cannot
transfer
to
a
school
that
a
negro
child
could
trans
--
could
transfer
from
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
equally,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
the
thing
--
the
system
is
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
is
your
point
then
that
a
government,
state
or
city
government,
not
only
is
permitted
from
carrying
out
a
choice
of
a
private
individual
based
on
race
but
also
is
affirmatively
compelled
to
deny
that
choice?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
said,
assuming
a
private
home,
not
a
--
let's
get
away
from
any
public
business,
assume
a
private
home,
a
private
lot,
an
empty
lot
in
a
neighborhood
which
is
a
owned
by
john
smith,
a
white
man
who's
a
very
prejudiced
man
on
racial
grounds,
and
he
doesn't
want
colored
children
playing
baseball
there
then
the
--
and
he
says
that
all
white
kids
can
come
and
play
there
but
i
don't
want
any
colored
children
playing
softball
in
my
vacant
lot.
here,
in
this
neighborhood
and
a
couple
come
and
he
calls
the
police
and
said,
â€œplease
arrest
these
people
for
trespass,
they
--
the
police
are
affirmatively
required
not
to
arrest
them
for
trespass,
is
that
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
we're
talking
about
that
very
private
thing,
when
we're
talking
about
where
parents
desire
their
children
to
be
educated,
aren't
we?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
personal
private
child
have
a
choice.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
they
can't
do,
but
we're
talking
about
that
public
school
system.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you're
--
but
you're
making
a
--
you're
going
further
as
i
understand
it,
you
tell
me
if
i'm
mistaken,
that
you
say
that
the
state
must
affirmatively
deny
that
private
choice
based
on
race.
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
don't
want
my
(voice
overlap)
--
my
child
going
to
a
school
with
white
children.
justice
potter
stewart
and
furthermore,
all
the
--
i
will
apply
to
you
my
compulsory
attendance
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
or
would
state
in
the
other
way
--
or
would
state
in
the
other
way
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
white
children
have
to
stay
in
a
school
if
they're
in
a
majority
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
even
with
51%.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
if
it
treats
them
--
there's
no
discrimination
against
negroes
as
such,
is
there?
i
don't
--
this
is
what
i
don't
get.
justice
potter
stewart
or
against,
if
you
call
it
discrimination,
then
they're
same
discrimination
against
the
white
people
in
a
particular
school?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
you
take
a
school
where
the
majority
are
white
people,
well
then
the
same
thing
is
true
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
depending
upon
the
wishes
of
the
other
children
and
their
parents.
ultimately
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
not
that
i
understand
you
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white
to
say
that
if
a
color
--
negro
mother
and
father
came
to
a
school
and
send
--
call
us
prejudiced
if
you
will,
but
we
simply
don't
like
our
child
to
be
in
school
with
a
--
where
there's
a
--
where
there
are
majority
of
white
boys
and
girls.
we're
old-fashioned,
we're
prejudiced,
we're
whatever
you
want
to
call
us,
but
we
don't
want
it,
we
don't
like
it,
and
we
think
it's
doing
our
child
harm
and
our
child
thinks
so
too.
and
we
therefore
want
to
transfer
her
to
a
school
where
there
are
majority
of
equal
of
our
own
race.
you
say
that
the
constitution
requires
the
school
board
to
deny
that
request?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
not
an
assignment,
this
is
a
request
by
the
mother
and
father
and
the
child,
a
voluntary
wish,
their
affirmative
of
desire.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
or
not
to
grant
that
request
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
still
--
you
haven't
answered
my
question
at
all,
so
far
as
i'm
concerned.
we're
not
talking
about
any
child
having
to
go
anywhere.
we're
talking
about
the
school
board's
--
what
its
constitutional
duty
is
when
faced
with
a
request
such
as
what
was
included
in
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
all
the
children
in
these
school
districts
are
compelled
to
go
to
school
under
the
truancy
laws
--
justice
potter
stewart
whether
that's
not
an
issue
here,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
there's
a
constitutional
rule
that
requires
that
there
is
a
--
that
a
pupils
in
a
school
be
--
that
a
school
be
biracial?
justice
potter
stewart
that
there
will
not
be
any
governmental
discrimination
against
them
because
of
their
race
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
the
color
of
their
skin.
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
majority.
justice
potter
stewart
and
not
allowing
a
member
of
the
majority
in
any
particular
school
house
to
transfer
under
these
provisions?
he
still
is
free
to
transfer
under
the
provisions
included
in
the
footnote
here
in
the
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
because
he
happens
to
--
his
race
happens
to
be
on
a
majority
in
any
given
school,
he
can't
transfer
under
the
--
request
to
transfer
under
these
provisions
but
although
he
can
under
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
desegregated
school
system
knows,
a
system
in
which
the
school
does
not
keep
anybody
out
because
of
his
race
whether
he'd
be
white
or
negro
or
any
other
race.
but
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
compelling
any
given
school
to
have
--
to
have
a
biracial
student
body,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
certainly
isn't
that
--
any,
any
child
assigned
to
a
school,
can
stay
in
the
school
as
the
school
isn't
keeping
anybody
out
on
account
of
his
race
and
under
the
system,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
people
out.
that's
what
the
brown
case
had
to
deal
with,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
only
as
i
--
it
operates
all
only
upon
the
affirmative,
private
wish
of
personal
human
beings,
not
by
government
actions.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
they
assigned
the
children
to
schools
and
then
any
transfer
is
triggered
and
actuated
only
by
the
personal
and
private
desire
of
the
student
or
his
parents
justice
potter
stewart
by
granting
a
transfer,
by
granting
a
transfer.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
marshall,
in
your
brief
--
your
brief
refers
to
this,
refers
to
this
as
a
transitional
plan.is
there
any
evidence
if
that's
what
it
is
because
the
naacp
takes
issue
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
including
this
--
the
degree
of
the
class
by
class?
justice
potter
stewart
integration
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
the
testimony
that
was
cited
to
us
yesterday
in
the
record
indicates
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
an
automatic
provision.
justice
potter
stewart
how
would
it
become
an
administrative
problem
from
the
school
board's
point
of
view?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
if
a
child
is
of
a
race
either
white
or
negro,
which
happens
to
be
in
the
majority
in
a
particular
school
and
if
he
affirmatively
desires
to
attend
an
integrated
school,
and
if
all
the
minority
under
this
plan
number
six,
transfer
out
then
he's
frustrated
in
that
desire,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
he
--
he
cannot
--
if
he
and
his
parents
want
him
to
have
the
experience,
affirmatively
want
him
to
have
the
experience
of
attending
a
school
where
there
are
children
of
both
races,
if
he
happens
to
be
in
a
majority
in
that
school
then
he's
not
allowed
to
transfer
under
this?
justice
potter
stewart
the
percentage
of
negro
and
white
population
in
your
school
board
in
davidson
county?
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
a
non-city
part
of
the
county,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
44
to

justice
potter
stewart
the
people
who
did
not
move
out?
justice
potter
stewart
your
school
board,
mr.
fowler,
is
coterminous
with
the
city
of
knoxville,
the
school
district?
justice

and
that's
in
east

your
state

you
have
three

justice

you're
in

there

there

you

yes.
justice

yes.

using

justice

--
who

the

limited
by
