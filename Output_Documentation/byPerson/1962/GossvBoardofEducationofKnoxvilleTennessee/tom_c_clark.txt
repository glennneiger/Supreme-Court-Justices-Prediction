justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
wouldn't
it
be
their
obligation
to
recognize
the
constitutional
right
of
this
person
to
have
this
child
choose
a
school
if
it
asks
to
go
to
another
school.
the
parent
asks
that
he
go
to
another
school
and
if
it
was
permissible,
other
conditions
being
permissible,
then
it's
clear
to
me
that
school
board
would
transfer
him.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i'm
not
saying
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
justice
brennan
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
didn't
used
that
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
but
this
language.
justice
tom
c.
clark
he
was
wrong
with
the
evidence.
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes.
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
you're
talking
about
a
different
case,
it
appears
to
me
--
i
can
well
say
your
position
in
your
case.
well,
that
sounds
that
rule
was,
that
parent
transfer
his
child,
i
mean
any
parent,
white
or
colored,
by
going
to
the
school
board
and
so
requesting
it.
would
it
then
be
the
constitutional
duty
of
the
school
board
to
refuse
the
transfer?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i
think
that's
what
justice
stewart
has
in
mind.
justice
tom
c.
clark
even
though
they
based
it
on
color.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i
misunderstood
your
answer
to
justice
white,
i'm
glad
you
straightened
it
up.
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
objection
is
to
freeze,
isn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
they're
frozen
in
a
school
that
is
a
majority
of
their
race,
that's
right,
isn't
it?
white
one
--
white
person
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
your
objection?
justice
tom
c.
clark
if
the
freeze
wasn't
there
you'd
have
no
objection?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
a
little
lot
broader
i'd
say
unjust
discrimination
against
the
negro
child,
discrimination
against
the
majority
race.
justice
tom
c.
clark
of
white
or
black?
justice
tom
c.
clark
are
those
the
test
is
actual
or
just
booked
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
just
paper?
mr.
greenberg
said
something
yesterday
but
it
didn't
just
paper
transferred.
i
didn't
understand
just
what
it
was.
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
child
is
really
transferred,
actually
transferred.
justice
tom
c.
clark
thank
you,
i
didn't
understand.
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes.
