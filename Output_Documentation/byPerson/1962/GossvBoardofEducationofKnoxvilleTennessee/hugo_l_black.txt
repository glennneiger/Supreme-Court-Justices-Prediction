justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
fifth
circuit
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
be
like
the
best
language
used
there,
you
don't
want
to
excuse
all
of
it
but
the
courts
really
don't
have
to
argue
that
in
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
in
practice,
but
not
under
the
--
not
under
the
--
on
the
face
of
the
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
the
court
made
any
finding
with
reference
to
the
questions
to
which
mr.
greenberg
called
our
attention
yesterday
and
answers
one
on
page
104,
105,
one
on
page
219,
where
the
official
in
answer
to
a
question
said,
â€œthe
plan
did
tend
to
perpetuate
segregation
and
that
on
page
219,
under
this
provision,
setting
forth
these
racial
conditions
based
on
the
minority
race
transfer,
the
effect
of
it
is
to
permit
a
child,
to
choose
segregation
out
of
his
zone,
outside
of
his
zone
but
not
to
choose
integration
outside
of
his
zone.
were
any
findings
made
on
those?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
refer
to
them
in
your
brief?
i'm
asking
you
for
this
reason,
i
understood
you
to
say
and
i
think
that
at
least
some
possibility
for
the
statement
that
what
the
brown
decision
here
was
that
there
must
be
moved
much
tall
integration.
that
meaning,
i
presume,
that
there
would
be
an
end
to
all
deliberate
speed,
that
that
wasn't
ad
infinitum?
and
i
--
from
what
i
understand
you
are
arguing,
you
are
arguing
that
where
it
does
not
move
on
in
that
direction,
though
sometimes,
the
reason
in
that
this
court
had
in
the
japanese
cases
in
the
west,
that
they
are
violating
the
ground,
order
and
decree.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
any
argument
to
the
effect
that
if
this
does
perpetuate,
undoubtedly
perpetuate
integration
and
that
if
it
does
what
it
said
on
page
219,
that
it
shows
that
the
purpose
of
the
brown
case
in
the
decree
rendered
under
it
namely
not
in
2,056
but
within
some
reasonable
time,
bring
an
end
to
this
situation
which
the
court
had
held
was
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
whatever
other
argument
you're
making
you're
also
making
the
argument
that
any
plan
which
inherently
and
inevitably
and
inescapable
works
to
perpetuate
integration
or
segregation
is
in
violation
of
the
court's
decree?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
officially
represent
the
school
board,
don't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
understand
any
of
these
others
that
argue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
mean
is
that
they
asked
to
be
transferred
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
appeal
that
you
have
a
right
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
they
wanted
to
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
just
wondering
if
you
ever
did
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
any
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
difference
between
your
plans?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
we
entitled
to
assume
i
believe
in
what
you
were
saying
that
whatever
that
plan
does
--
your
plan
does?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
fowler,
you
say
some
of
them
could
(inaudible)
for
your
frankness,
i
think
you
commended
for,
i
say
in
advance
to
the
question
that
we'll
ask
you
because
of
your
frankness
that
i
want
to
ask
if
you
don't
object
in
answering
the
question.
you
referred
to
the
transition
theory.
i
assume
that
you
mean
by
that
that
you
recognize
that
by
decisions
it
means
that
the
normal
thing
thereafter
can
be
achieved
within
what
you
call
reasonable
deliberate
speed.
the
normal
thing
would
be
to
have
no,
nothing
but
integration?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
you
say
transition
period
in
your
judgment
if
you
have
any,
i
understand
that
you
get,
i
understand
that
knoxville
is
different
from
memphis,
memphis
is
different
from
nashville.
both
of
them
are
different
venue,
yes,
but
in
your
judgment,
what
is
--
it
appeared
within
which
you
may
reasonably
look
forward,
if
you
don't
mind
giving
it
for
having
the
problem
settled.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
city.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
one
more
question
to
follow
that.
you
may
have
detected
from
the
question
i
ask
about
the
answers
at
pages
95
and
219.
i
believe
that
was
from
your
officials.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
indicated
that
answer
at
least
it
could
be
read
into
it
without
looking
at
it
that
it
was
setup
and
certainly
as
ineher
--
inherent
to
retard
the
ending
of
the
transition
period
as
though
it
would
be
permissible
to
be
done.
that
question
--
that
answer
bothered
me
a
little
bit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
answered
that
segregation
is
perpetuated
thereby.
now,
as
i
understand
from
you,
your
argument
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
board
doesn't
want
to
perpetuate
it;
that
it
is
engaging
on
a
program
within
its
judgment
if
the
transition
purposes
only
to
recognize
that
they
are
required
as
a
--
members
of
an
orderly
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
goes
on
and
proceeds?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
has
been
the
result
in
figures?
justice
hugo
l.
black
out
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
how
is
that
number?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
for
six
grades,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
for
the
six
grades?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
are
open
schools
on
the
three
grades,
aren't
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
you're
trying
it
on
a
grade
by
grade
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
left
with
the
third.
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
every
year?
