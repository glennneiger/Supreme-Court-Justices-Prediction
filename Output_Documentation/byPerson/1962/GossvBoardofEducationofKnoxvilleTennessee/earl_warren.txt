217,
josephine
goss,
et
al.,
petitioners,
versus
the
board
of
education
of
the
city
of
knoxville,
tennessee.
mr.
marshall.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
suppose
also
that
your
position
that
this
system
does
result
in
a
built-in
system
of
segregation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dodson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
long
as
you're
representing
the
different
interest,
are
you
representing
the
interest
of
the
children
in
the
school
where
the
majority
is
--
are
negroes
and
who
might
want
to
transfer
to
another
school?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
you
haven't
considered
that
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
your
ordinance
--
your
ordinance
says
that
they
cannot,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
the
rule
takes
cognizance
and
the
emotional
strain
on
the
pupil
before
the
parent
say
anything
about
it
and
the
one
situation
why
doesn't
it
take
consideration
of
it
in
the
other
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you
are
writing
into
your
--
into
your
rules
the
segregation
policies
of
the
people,
are
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
say
that
you
are
satisfied
that
they
will
never
do
that,
therefore
you
didn't
put
it
in
your
rules
but
then
you
do
that
because
you
know
that
the
people
and
you
are
the
white
people
and
your
community
are
segregation-minded
and
you
don't
make
any
provision
for
those
who
might
not
be
segregation-minded.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
just
told
me
a
moment
ago
though
that
the
reason
that
more
didn't
pay
any
attention
to
that
was
because
they
felt
it
just
never
would
happen
in
that
community
that
a
person
would
want
to
do
that
thing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you're
building
that
right
into
your
--
into
your
system,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
that
if
it
does
happen,
is
if
someone
does
want
to
take
that
action
some
parent
does,
he's
prevented
from
doing
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
the
others
can
put
it
on
the
basis
of
race
but
he
cannot?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
davidson
county,
how
many
negroes
are
in
public
schools,
in
the
integrated
schools
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
--
just
davidson
county.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
you
have
the
42.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
that
is
negroes
in
integrated
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fowler.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
always
have
zones,
mr.
fowler?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
this
problem
became
a
problem?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
negroes
are
there
in
non-segregated
schools
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
excuse
me
--
what
do
you
mean
by
disturbance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
being
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
between
white
boys
to
each
other,
negro
boys
to
each
other
but
it
can
get
infinitely
worse
if
you
let
a
race
to
a
consideration
get
into
it,
your
honor.
to
account
is
certainly
if
the
school
board
encourages
the
segregation
idea.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
petree.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
schools
are
not
open?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
many
of
those
are
negroes
and
how
many
are
white
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
school
is
a
closed
school
and
the
negro
child
lived
across
the
street
from
it,
he
couldn't
go
to
that
school?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
no,
if
he
was
beyond
the
third
grade
now,
he
could
not
go
to
that
school?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
plan
provides
--
i
mean
with
the
rules
provide
for
it,
do
they
not?
that
he
shall
not
go
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
finish
your
statement
that
you're
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
you
were
just
saying
now
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
goldberg
--
mr.
greenberg
rather.
