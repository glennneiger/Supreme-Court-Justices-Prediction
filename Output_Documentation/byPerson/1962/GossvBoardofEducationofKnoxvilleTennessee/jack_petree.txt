mr.
jack
petree
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
state
to
the
court
my
gratitude
for
the
privilege
of
participating
in
this
argument.
i'm
also
grateful
to
my
brothers
on
my
right
who
have
yielded
to
me
a
few
minutes
of
their
precious
time.
if
the
court
please,
i
would
say
that
there
are
as
many
differences
in
the
day-to-day
operation
of
school
systems
as
there
are
school
systems.
a
great
deal
of
time
and
discussion
has
been
devoted
yesterday
afternoon
and
this
morning
to
that
negro
majority
who
is
denied
the
right
granted
to
the
negro
minority
to
transfer.
this
case
is
important
to
memphis
because
in
our
school
system,
approximately
50%
of
some
47
different
units
of
our
school's
grades
one
through
nine
or
what
we
termed
open
schools
and
a
person
can
transfer
to
an
open
school
regardless
of
reason.
there
is
no
need
for
reason.
now,
it
is
true
that
operating
under
our
plan
that
transfer
will
be
granted
to
a
negro
student
only
if
he
is
in
one
of
the
grades
covered
by
the
plan.
i
should
hasten
to
point
out,
however,
that
under
the
memphis
plan,
which
is
an
appendix
in
the
brief,
the
board
will
grant
a
transfer
and
intends
to
grant
transfers
in
the
future
where
there
is
a
reasonable
educational
need
to
a
negro
child
even
though
that
child's
grade
is
not
covered
by
the
plan.
mr.
jack
petree
well,
we
will
start
the
fourth
grade
in
september,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
petree
47,
we
have
96
school
units
one
through
nine,
justice
brennan,
47
of
those
units
are
open
schools.
mr.
jack
petree
i
should
--
mr.
jack
petree
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
jack
petree
school,
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
petree
now,
of
those
open
schools,
they
are
the
schools
which
have
been
desegregated
because
those
are
the
schools
that
negro
children
made
application,
they
were
predominantly
--
they
opened
schools
or
either
--
maybe
either
white
or
negro,
they
are
about
evenly
divided
between
white
and
negro
schools.
but
it
was
these
open
schools
that
were
desegregated
when
we
were
trying
to
operate
under
our
pupil
assignment
law.
we
have
only
filed,
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
our
pupil
assignment
case
in
june
28,
1962.
we
attempted
to
file
this
plan
to
have
it
in
operation
by
september
of
1962,
however,
we
only
got
it
prepared
and
filed
in
august
of
31st,
so
we
have
not
operated
really
successfully
under
a
plan
of
desegregation.
we
have
desegregated
by
permitting
negro
students
who
wanted
to
attend
a
desegregated
school
to
apply
and
receive
transfers
to
the
so-called
open
schools.
mr.
jack
petree
6
--
i
believe
it's
63
students
approximately,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
petree
we
have
106,000
students,
approximately
in
grades
one
through
six
today
52.25
of
those
students
are
negro
students
that
would
mean
some
60,000
of
them
perhaps
were
negroes,
55,000.
the
remaining
55,000
are
white
students.
mr.
jack
petree
some
approximately
63,
if
the
court
please.
now,
may
--
mr.
jack
petree
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
jack
petree
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
jack
petree
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
jack
petree
yes,
sir.
now
let
me
--
mr.
jack
petree
40
--
roughly
49
schools
are
not
open
school.
mr.
jack
petree
i
would
say
that
the
--
again
they
are
approximately
evenly
balanced.
it
depends
--
a
closed
school
is
closed,
if
the
court
please,
based
upon
facilities
that
can
take
care
of
the
needs
of
a
neighborhood.
they
are
not
closed
for
any
other
reason,
that's
the
only
reason
that
we
would
close
a
school.
so
that
if
the
school
has
more
than
ample
facilities
can
take
care
of
more
students,
it
is
declared
to
be
an
open
school
and
other
children
may
transfer
into
it
without
reason.
mr.
jack
petree
if
you
were
in
the
plan,
he
would
have
to
go
to
that
school,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jack
petree
that's
likely,
i
will
say
generally
speaking,
no.
but
again,
that's
a
matter
of
logic,
if
the
court
please.
if
a
negro
child
petitioned
to
go
to
the
school
that
he
lives
directly
across
the
street
from.
i
doubt
seriously
that
my
board,
even
though
he
was
not
in
the
plan
would
deny
that
application.
mr.
jack
petree
the
plan
of
desegregation
of
that
child
it
is
true,
if
the
court
please.
that
child
is
not
covered
by
the
plan
of
desegregation
and
he
would
have
no
--
it
would
be
a
matter
of
discretion
with
the
board
whether
he
would
let
--
whether
he
would
let
that
child
go
to
that
school.
mr.
jack
petree
yes,
your
honor,
we
are.
mr.
jack
petree
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
petree
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
we
took
in
two
grades
this,
this
year,
the
first
year
of
operation
of
our
plan
tentative.
mr.
jack
petree
first
grade,
sir.
yes,
sir.
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
take
the
time
that
remains
to
me
to
try
to
put
this
case
on
a
little
different
perspective
from
that
which
we
have
been
devoting
most
of
the
discussion.
mr.
fowler
touched
on
it
very
briefly.
the
state
action
has
created
a
problem.
it
has
assigned
a
child,
who
is
in
the
minority
to
a
given
school.
now,
there's
no
question
that
the
problem
exist
with
respect
to
that
minority
child.
the
petitioners
acknowledged
the
existence
of
the
problem
in
some
instances.
in
some
instances
there
is
no
problem
but
we
are
only
concerned
with
those
problem
cases.
the
solicitor
general
recognizes
that
a
problem
exists
and
they
offer
a
certain
solutions
for
the
problem.
i
there
--
i
suggest
that
the
solutions
which
they
offer
do
not
meet
the
problem.
they
would
have
you
believe
that
this
is
a
plan
which
is
solely
designed
to
retard
the
desegregation
of
the
school
system.
that
it
will
retard
it
by
permitting
the
white
minority
child
to
escape
from
the
negro
school.
i
respectfully
suggest,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
direct
converse
is
true.
let
us
assume
the
situation
where
we
have
no
provision
such
as
this.
and
let
us
assume
that
a
white
parent
is
assigned
or
a
white
student
is
assigned
as
a
minority
in
a
predominantly
negro
school.
the
parent
goes
to
the
school
board
and
asked
for
a
transfer,
and
now
he
is
not
sophisticated
enough
to
give
us
the
magic
word,
he
says,
“i
want
to
transfer
because
of
race.”
we
say,
“no,
you've
given
us
that
reason,
we
can't
grant
the
transfer.”
it
then
becomes
a
race
between
the
truant
officer
and
the
real
estate
agent.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
most
casual
glimpse
of
most
urban
communities
reflects
that
those
white
parents,
who
are
economically
affluent,
will
simply
move
to
the
suburban
areas.
so
the
board
of
education
has
no
real
problem
with
a
white
parent,
with
a
white
minority.
they
simply
flee
to
suburbia
and
there
we
are.
the
board
is
not
going
to
be
bothered
with
this
white
minority
child.
where
the
difficulty
is
going
to
come
is
in
this
less
economically
affluent
group.
in
most
instances,
the
negro
child,
who
is
caught
in
an
educational
environment
that
his
parents
recognize
was
--
is
not
best
suited
for
him.
so
this
parent
comes
to
the
school
board
and
says,
“i
want
to
transfer,”
and
that
parent
is
not
sophisticated
either.
it
doesn't
know
the
magic
words,
it
says
race.
and
we
are
caught,
we
can't
do
it.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it's
this
group;
it's
the
economic
unaffluent
group
who
are
going
to
be
punished
by
the
absence
of
this
provision.
it's
this
group
that
perhaps
the
people
on
this
side
of
the
table
should
represent
more
than
i.
but
it's
this
group
who
are
going
to
be
hurt
by
a
provision
or
the
absence
of
such
a
provision.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
these
minorities,
the
negro
or
the
poor
white
minority
are
going
to
be
made
to
swallow
their
constitutional
right.
that's
--
it's
going
to
be
pushed
down
their
throat
by
state
action.
state
action
first
created
this
problem
--
excuse
me,
if
the
court
please,
it
seems
my
time
is
up.
i'm
grateful
--
mr.
jack
petree
alright.
mr.
jack
petree
i
say
that,
if
the
court
please,
the
removal
of
this
provision
is
going
to
compel
this
economically
less
fortunate
neighborhood
--
children
to
swallow
their
constitutional
rights.
the
economically
affluent,
they're
not
going
to
be
concerned,
they
simply
move
to
a
neighborhood
where
the
school
is
predominantly
white.so
they
have
no
problem.
it's
these
children,
the
less
economically
affluent
which
will
be
compelled
to
accept
their
constitutional
rights.
mr.
jack
petree
there
is
nothing
wrong
--
no,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
petree
no,
sir.
there
is
nothing
whatsoever
wrong
with
an
integrated
school.
let
me
say
this,
if
the
court
please.
there
are
children
who
may
be
emotionally
involved
as
a
result
of
being
in
the
minority.
there
may
be
children
who
will
have
an
educational
problem
by
being
cast
as
a
minority.
now,
shall
we
create
this
problem?
shall
we
have
this
emotional
attack?
and
then
after
the
harm
has
been
done
then
grant
the
transfer?
shall
we
create
the
educational
problem?
now,
education
in
a
parent-child
relationship
is
an
intimate
one.
i
think
a
negro
parent
has
the
same
ability
to
say
before
this
harm
comes
that
i
don't
want
my
child
there
yet.
that
a
board
of
education
has
to
say
after
the
harm
comes,
you
may
avoid
the
situation.
i
think
that
you
are
trying
to
balance
two
substantial
constitutional
problems.
is
this
state
action?
is
this
state
action
that
discriminates
against
one
because
of
race
or
is
this
state
action
which
is
in
aid
of
minority
races?
i
suggest
that
even
if
it
be
the
--
if
it's
discrimination
which
is
unconstitutional,
this
court
should
balance
that
discrimination
against,
against
the
freedom
of
a
parent.
and
these
parents
that
i've
talked
about
to
choose
in
the
first
place,
the
school
which
they
want
their
child
to
go
to.
much
of
this
choice
is
not
going
to
be
based
on
discriminatory
reasons.
it's
going
to
be
based
on
pure
educational
reasons
that
that
parent
feels.
thank
you,
if
the
court
please.
