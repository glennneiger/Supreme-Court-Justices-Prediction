justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
hadn't
--
if
they
hadn't
impose
the
rule
in
the
first
place
and
some
negro
children
and
some
white
children
came
and
requested
a
transfer,
you
would
make
the
same
--
have
the
same
objection,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
was
admittedly
and
they
--
and
when
they
made
the
request
of
the
general
transfer,
it
was
admittedly
administered
strictly
on
a
racial
basis.
i
mean,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
just
that
the
--
the
white
child
didn't
want
to
go
to
the
negro
school.
the
negro
child
didn't
want
to
go
to
the
white
school.
that's
all
there
was
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
aren't
you
really
relying
--
have
to
rely
on
shelley
and
kraemer
right
on
it's
--
that
no
matter
how
private
the
discrimination
that
the
state
uses
any
means
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
enforce
it,
that
it's
bad.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
isn't
that
--
aren't
you
driven
to
that,
to
the
--
just
to
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
the
--
excuse
me,
mr.
greenberger.
what
play
would
you
give
to
the
wishes
of
the
children
and
their
parents,
the
354
negroes
who
transferred
out
of
schools
in
which
they
were
in
the
minority
and
the
300
or
so
whites
who
transferred,
would
the
--
would
their
desires
or
wishes
be
irrelevant
to
the
transfer
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
come
in
and
they
come
in
and
i
assume
that
all
of
these
were
because
they,
let's
say
the
negro
child
didn't
want
to
be
in
the
white
school
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
a
white
child
didn't
want
to
be
in
the
negro
school,
what
play
would
you
give
this
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
say,
these
are
stricken
down,
these
standards
are
stricken
down
and
the
general
transfer
--
justice
byron
r.
white
these
same
people
make
the
same
request
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
give
the
same
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
marshall,
can
you
tell
me
where
that
rule,
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say,
do
you
say
that
what's
happened
in
another
school
is
no
answer
in
the
district
which
you
choose
to
talk
about.
also,
i
take
it
that
you
agree
with
mr.
greenberg
that
there's
no
answer
that
they
desired
to
the
parents
of
the
children
are
to
transfer,
that
the
state
has
--
it's
constitutionally
prohibited
from
recognizing
the
private
choices
of
the
parents
and
the
children
to
transfer.
and
it's
just
as
simple
as
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
mr.
marshall,
let's
get
it
really
straight.
you
--
you
would
say
that
the
school
board
could
not
allow
that
transfer
unless
the
white
child
in
the
school
could
also
be
able
to
get
the
same
transfer.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
--
if
the
school
board
--
if
where
a
negro
is
in
a
minority,
the
negro
parent
comes
in
and
says,
“i
would
like
my
child
transferred,”
that's
why
they
stick
on
purely
racial
ground.
the
school
board
could
allow
that
transfer
if
the
white
person
who
came
in
and
wanted
to
transfer
out,
would
allow
to
transfer
on
purely
racial
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
white
person
comes
in
and
says,
“i
don't
want
to
be
in
this
school
but
any
negro
do.”
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
dodson,
if
this
is
so
why
did
the
school
board
find
it
necessary
to
set
aside
particularly
in
the
state,
after
having
--
stated
a
general
transfer
school
if
he
required
which
we
cited
that's
either
the
cause,
why
did
it
feel
required
to
go
on
and
invite
parents'
contention
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
require
--
would
it
require
in
those
decisions?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
require
in
those
decisions?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
you
weren't
required
to
put
this
in
by
those
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
were
you
--
why
did
--
why
were
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
parent
--
the
parent
had
asked
that
the
way
it
actually
operates
was
nobody
had
to
transfer.
they
just
came
in
and
got
different
assignments,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
your
position
that
if
a
parent
comes
in
and
take
advantage
of
the
rules
and
says,
i
want
to
transfer
and
this
factually
gives
satisfy
these
rules
at
the
end
of
the
inquiry.
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
far
it
has
been.
there's
no
inquiry
about
being
nervous
or
having
a
shock
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
anything
of
that
kind?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
inquiry
to
the
educational
advantage
for
disciplining
the
children?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
other
people
are
allowed
to
transfer
out
of
that
school
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
for
practical
reasons
because
of
race
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no
--
i
take
it
that
some
of
them
--
is
this
choice
is
made
every
year
or
once
you
make
your
transfer
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
are
some
of
these
185
people
and
children
who
previously
have
chosen
to
go
to
other
schools?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
that
if
the
people
moved
state
in
an
integrated
school
doubled
10%
to
20%
but
that
entirely
increase
has
made
of
negroes,
i
suppose
who
chose
to
stay
in
integrated
schools
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
fact
--
are
the
white,
are
the
whites
who
the
288
who
transferred
out
are
some
of
that
--
have
some
of
those
transferred
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
we
--
have
you
had
some
instance
as
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
the
reason
for
the
transfer
of
policy
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
weren't
any
request
then
and
there
hasn't
been
a
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
it
is
your
opinion
that
now
there
were
such
a
request
and
a
disturbance
was
not
anticipated
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
this
would
be
a
good
cause
under
rule
5
to
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
want
to
go
to
an
integrated
school
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
--
the
rules
says
that
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
fowler,
excuse
me
please.
assume
for
the
moment
the
only
thing
wrong
with
rule
6,
the
thing
that
it
is
wrong
or
that
would
be
the
only
thing
wrong
except
for
this
wrong?
but
just
assuming
the
only
thing
that's
wrong
is
that
the
person
who
wants
to
go
to
an
integrated
school
that
isn't
permitted
to
do
so
if
unless
he
--
when
he
is
in
his
own
zone
and
he's
in
the
majority.
now,
i
take
it
that
you
say
now
that
it
would
be
a
good
enough
reason
to
transfer
if
some
negro
or
a
white
was
in
the
majority
and
in
his
own
wants
to
transfer
out
solely
for
the
reason
to
go
to
an
integrated
school.
i
take
it
that
you
would
now
apply
a
rule
5
to
permit
that
transfer,
if
there
were
room
and
if
there
was
not
going
to
be
a
disturbance.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
if,
if
that
was
all
that
was
wrong
with
the
rule
5,
then
what
you
are
saying
now
is
this
beside
the
point,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
rule
6,
excuse
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
arguing,
you're
arguing
that
you
should
be
able
to
permit
people
to
the
negroes,
for
example
to
transfer
out
of
schools
where
they
don't
want
to
stay?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
