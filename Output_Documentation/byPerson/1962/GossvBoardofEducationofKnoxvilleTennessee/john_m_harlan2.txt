i
wonder
what
the
discrimination
plans
as
i
understand
your
arrangement,
put
this
issue
little
differently.
what
i
understand
you're
saying
is
that
this
is
justice
if
the
state
didn't
pass
the
law
in
saying
that
those
who
believe
in
segregation
can
transfer
out
of
deseg
--
out
of
integrated
schools
but
those
who
believe
in
non-segregated
schools
cannot
transfer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
negro
or
white.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
discrimination
here
is
not
between
the
white
and
the
negro
child;
it's
between
the
segregationist
and
the
integrationist?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
a
white,
a
white
child
who
wants
to
go
to
an
integrated
school
can't
do
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
race;
it's
the
question
of
whether
he
believes
in
segregation
or
so
call
it.
