mr.
s.
frank
fowler
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
latter
statute
was
correct,
mr.
justice
black.
the
knoxville
plan
has
been
interpreted
by
those
who
administered
in
knoxville
as
according
to
members
of
the
negro
majority.
free
transfers
wherever
they
want
to
go
or
call.
i
do
not
know
whether
knoxville
has
indulged
that
liberality
of
treatment
or
not.
if
that
is
clearly
established
by
the
knoxville
record
on
page
94,
where
mr.
--
doctor
burkhart
has
testified
and
also
by
the
man
who
was
actually
in-charge
of
transfers,
mr.
(inaudible)
at
pages
117
and
118.
that
does
not
go
to
the
question
which
mr.
justice
goldberg
asked.
namely,
whether
a
member
of
the
negro
majority
could
transfer
in
order
to
get
into
a
desegregated
school
to
which
dr.
burkhart
replied
that
he
didn't
think
so
that
it
had
not
been
the
administrative
practice.
one
must
recall
that
these
items
of
testimony
appearing
in
this
record
were
taken
in
1960,
which
was
early
in
the
testing
of
the
ability
of
the
knoxville
system
to
receive
this
disregard
of
the
color
line
which
it
is
now
become
accustomed
to.
i
think
that
in
the
light
of
mr.
(inaudible)
testimony
that
it
can
be
safely
said
that
if
no
particular
disturbance
in
the
school
to
which
such
a
negro
would
be
transferred
is
to
be
anticipated
by
reason
of
that,
there
is
no
reason
why
his
request
should
not
be
granted,
particularly
if
there
is
any
metal
--
mental
stress
or
unhappiness
on
the
part
of
the
child's
parents
as
being
denied,
desegregation
in
the
school
of
his
own.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
your
honor,
if
there
has
been
one
quietly
conductive
process
of
desegregation
it
has
been
knoxville.
and
we
are
rather
proud
of
the
fact
that
we
have
achieved
very
considerable
progress
without
publicity.
i
will
say
this
that
wherever
that
there
was
any
necessity
of
communicating
particular
notices
to
the
public,
the
newspaper
has
been
freely
used
and
i
don't
think
there's
ever
been
any
announcement
of
that
but
there
have
been
tests
of
all
kinds,
attempt
to
probe
into
the
system
to
see
whether
this
could
be
done
and
that
could
be
done.
but
i
know
--
don't
know
yet
of
any
attempt
along
that
line.
perhaps
we'll
have
one
but
as
soon
as
we
get
home
and
i
take
that
the
test
will
be.
i
mean
on
the
question
that
the
court
do
not
suggest
that's
actual.
but
i
think
the
actual
be
as
i've
indicated
that
if
there
--
upon
a
balancing
of
the
desire
or
the
need
of
these
students
for
that
transfer,
i
guess
it
had
may
affect
the
school
to
which
he's
transferred.
the
decision
of
the
board
will
be
made.
it
maybe
already
a
desegregated
school
and
no
question
at
all.
the
transfer
grounds
are
granted
and
have
been
for
years
and
years
and
years
as
a
matter
of
convenience
for
reasons
which
perhaps
comparatively
trivial.
employment
of
a
parent
closed
by
and
i
see
no
reason
if
there's
room
in
the
transferee
school,
and
if
there
are
going
to
be
no
disturbance
there
why
the
request
should
not
be
granted.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
no.
not
to
that
i
know
of.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
there
has
been
no
change
of
policy
at
all,
so
far
as
the
officer
is
concerned
who
was
conducting
it.
dr.
burkhart,
chairman
of
the
board,
who
has
a
(inaudible)
position
and
really
he
is
not
intimately
familiar
with
what
goes
on
in
the
office
of
the
man
charged
with
the
transfer
responsibility,
was
probably
right
when
he
testified
in
1960.
that
after
that
time
the
administrative
policy
had
been
to
deny
or
would
be
to
deny
such
request.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
right.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
it
would
be
--
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
i
don't
think
it
need
even
be
good
cause,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
there's
no
particular
reason
for
denying
it,
we'll
grant
it.
now,
we're
not
committed
to
a
free
system
of
transfer.
we
do
have
the
zones
and
we
have
to
have
zones
because
we
have
to
limit
the
number
of
available
--
the
number
of
potential
pupils
to
the
capacity
of
the
school
that
serves
that
zone.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
we
have
zones.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
we
had
zones
under
the
old
two
systems;
a
segregate
system
and
of
course
they
we're
overlapping
and
i
think
there
was
some
confusion
about
that
yesterday.
but
under
the
system
we're
talking
about,
of
desegregation,
we
only
have
one
system
of
zones.
and
they're
contiguous
and
they
cover
the
whole
city
and
there
may
be
a
great
area
than
a
particular
zone
where
there
are
no
negroes.
but
nevertheless,
it
is
zoned
that
way.
i
mean
his
zone,
regardless
of
race.
i
don't
think
there's
any
occasion
for
harking
back
to
the
double
zone
system
that
existed
under
segregation.
we're
talking
now
about
how
we
conduct
ourselves
under
a
desegregated
--
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
there
are
portions
in
the
school
that's
about
20%
negro
to
80%
white.
and
we
have
no
60-40
zones
for
students.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
we
have
no
division
that
close.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
the
majority
is
always
tremendously
greater
because
apparently,
there
has
been
a
greater
clustering
together
--
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
are
a
residential
or
races
put
together.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
there
are
84
according
to
the
information
that
i
got
before
i
came
up
here
on
this
date.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
about
42
or
300
somewhere
in
that.
well,
that
sounds
insignificantly,
may
it
please
the
court,
but
when
you
consider
the
residential
concentration,
this
means
that
one-third
of
those
who
could
stay,
that
is
those
in
the
minority
groups,
the
negroes
in
predominant
white
schools.
those
are
the
only
ones
who
are
desegregated
at
present,
could
have
been
only
three
times
greater
than
that.
that
is
to
say
the
negro
minorities
in
white
schools,
predominant
white
schools
are
managed
about
250
students,
a
third
haven't
stayed
there,
two-thirds
rejected
the
opportunity
or
as
it
maybe
put,
waived
their
constitutional
right
to
desegregation.
now
--
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
the
possible
service
is
this,
and
this
is
something
that's
a
bond
petitioner
has
been
or
even
among
counsel.
rule
6
entitled
school
board
to
transfer
on
the
fairer
ground
of
race,
regardless
of
the
lack
of
unhappiness,
prejudice,
or
disadvantage.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
plan
is
valid,
but
may
not
be
used
to
perpetuate
desegregation.
upon
analysis,
that
might
mean
that
you
cannot
grant
transfers
from
the
fairer
ground
of
race.
now,
knoxville
with
considerable
additional
administrative
expense
can
accommodate
itself.
i
don't
think
memphis
can
or
nashville
or
chattanooga
can
accommodate
itself
to
striking
out
that
ground.
and
we
can
proceed
on
good
cause
which
compels
us
to
investigate
each
case
individually.
i
think
which
seems
to
be
wholly
impracticable
elsewhere.
and
that
is
the
reason
for
the
battle
on
the
constitutionality
of
this
provision
in
the
transfer
play.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
no
consideration
to
what,
your
honor?
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
yes.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
there
has
been
consideration.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
yes.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
we
find
it
of
--
we
find
it
of
value
as
an
administrative
matter.
we
would
have
to
put
on
additional
personnel.
it
would
complicate
the
handling
of
this
problem.
and
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
proceed
to
a
point
that
is
relevant
here.
and
that
is
what
was
said
in
argument
yesterday
about
the
position
of
the
knoxville
school
board,
our
position
being
represented
as
that
even
if
this
transfer
ground
is
struck
out
of
the
plan
and
we're
going
to
do
it
anyhow.
now,
the
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
school
board
in
the
city
of
knoxville
asserted
that
if
the
grounds
are
knocked
out
of
this
plan,
that
nevertheless
knoxville
did
not
feel
that
it
should
blind
itself
to
the
educational
disadvantages
of
any
pupil
in
the
public
school.
and
if
it
should
find
cases
of
pupils
who
are
under
pressure,
under
persecution
or
under
handicapped
by
a
reason
even
if
it
stems
from
racial
origins
or
racial
facts.
the
school
board
felt
that
it
would
be
its
duty
to
transfer
that
child
upon
appropriate
application
when
it
appeared
to
be
in
the
interest
of
the
child's
education.
now,
this
statement
which
comes
from
me
that
we
intended
to
go
ahead
anyhow
as
if
in
violation
of
the
supreme
court's
holding
or
treatment
of
this
plan
indicates
how
far
their
application
to
the
story
of
this
plan
goes.
it
goes
to
this
point
of
compelling
and
coercing
these
minority
pupils
to
stay
in
schools
where
they
don't
belong,
where
they're
unhappy.
if
they're
negroes
where
they
may
be
subjected
to
the
customary
epithets
and
names
and
if
they're
white
they
may
be
called
poor
white
trash
and
all
that
business,
thereby,
destroying
that
opportunity
which
is
the
duty
of
the
school
board
to
provide.
now,
we
think
that
in
the
consideration
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
matter
that
the
fact
that
you're
building
into
or
engrafting
into
the
school
system
a
core
of
improperly
treated
pupils
against
the
wish
of
the
parents
and
the
welfare,
the
pupils
themselves
is
to
create
something
which
may
lead
to
the
ultimate
collapse
of
the
whole
thing.
but
one
thing,
there
are
economic
consequences
which
may
follow
as
exodus
of
whites
by
selling
their
residences
and
that
has
occurred.
and
it's
a
reasonable
thing
for
a
white
person
to
do
in
our
community
and
particularly
in
other
communities
of
tennessee.
the
white
people
can
transfer
their
children
to
private
schools,
so
that
one
becomes
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
are
consequences
going
beyond
the
mere
distribution
of
the
case
of
a
particular
pupil.
and
on
top
of
that,
the
impact
of
this
business
is
not
going
to
be
on
the
white
minorities,
because
by
reason
of
a
little
bit
better
affluence,
they
can
avoid
it.
the
impact
is
going
to
be
upon
the
negro
minorities,
who
can't
move
at
and
can't
send
their
children
to
private
schools.
so
they
will
be
the
ones
whose
--
who
are
in
effect
confined
to
places
that
they
would
rather
be
at
out.
so,
on
that
score
we
feel
that
such
consideration
is
irrelevant
on
the
part
--
on
the
point
of
consideration
of
constitutionality
which
to
my
mind
being
almost
completely
uninformed
on
the
gradations
and
the
new
answers
of
these
questions
that
have
been
put
and
pays
back
and
forth
largely
consists
not
in
determining
whether
this
is
a
matter
of
state
action
entirely.
but
whether
do
you
get
down
to
the
wis
--
the
point
of
is
it
a
wise
action?
is
it
wise
to
leave
an
educational
system
with
a
sickness?
is
it
wise
to
do
these
things
which
may
appear
to
carry
harm
in
the
directions
in
which
it's
not
intended?
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
that's
not
what
was
wrong
with
rule
5.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
now,
we
would
rule
6
--
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
well,
i
don't
think
we'll
have
any
trouble
with
such
applicants
in
knoxville
if
in
the
judgment
of
the
board
there
were
going
to
be
no
disturbances
at
classroom
atmosphere,
no
tenseness
created
--
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
now
that
means
it
is
for
our
disposition
in
the
light
of
rule
6
where
we
can
rely
too.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
well,
your
honor,
i
can
picture
a
negro
child
being
transferred
into
a
residential
section
in
knoxville
where
perhaps
his
presence
would
be
more
unwelcome
as
being
totally
unexpected
and
that
being
a
sought
actor
presence
on
his
part.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
a
sought
actor.
he's
seeking
to
put
himself
into
a
group
where
the
group
really
feels
he
doesn't
belong.
he
has
no
reasons
for
being
there.
he
lived
way
over
similar
else
in
town.
now,
i
wouldn't
be
surprised
of
what
a
disturbance
there.
it
might
consist
of
physical
abuse,
fights,
his
presence
in
the
school
room
would
tend
to
disrupt
things
because
he
might
be
--
a
paper
was
thrown
at
him
or
being
stuck
in
him
or
something
like
that
and
then
the
same
thing
might've
well
occur
a
white
child
who
seeks
out
from
his
permitted
attendance
to
the
negro
school.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
you
mean
on
--
sure,
surely,
surely.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
there
has
been
no
segregation
--
encouragement
of
the
segregation
idea
by
this
board,
your
honor.
this
board
is
exercising
all
the
wisdom
it
possesses
to
let
this
plan
progress
according
to
the
most
reasonable
and
assured
course
of
retaining
these
good
educational
facilities
conducted
in
the
right
atmosphere
in
this
town
of
ours.
now,
that
can
be
grievously
disturbed
by
two
eager,
a
breaking
down
of
these
things
and
that's
an
aspect
of
this
plan
as
a
transition
matter
as
an
expedient
during
the
period
of
transition
and
it
is
a
transition
matter
because
it's
set
forth
in
a
transition
plan
maybe
--
namely
the
desegregation
plan
itself,
the
step
plan
of
12
grades.
this
plan
operates
as
does
the
step
plan
to
limit
the
volume
of
the
desegregation
each
year
of
the
250
negro
minority
pupils
who
could
now
be
in
a
desegregated
system
only
about
84
of
that.
the
same
restricting
influence
on
a
number
of
pupils
who
disintegrate
or
desegregate
is
applied
by
the
step
plan
itself.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
that
--
250
is
an
approximation.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
these
are
original
set
of
figures
--
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
beginning
over
88
negro
pupils
in
the
first
grade
in
minority
situations
--
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
--
who
could
stay
in
segregation.
of
those
28
or
approximately
one
third
stayed
there.
now
we
have
84
as
to
progressive
four
grades
damage
two
grade
a
year
plan
now
--
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
that's
right.
now,
we
have
84
actually
there
as
to
applying
a
ratio
of
3:1,
i've
figured
that
you
have
250
or
so.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
the
thing
that
limits
--
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
the
zones?
the
negroes
chose
their
residences.
there
is
a
school
house,
here
a
reasonable
line
drawn
around
it
fitting
the
capacity
of
the
school.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
in
the
part
where
they
live.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
well,
the
city
--
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
--
that
we've
started
with
before
we
are
next
doing
the
progress
of
this
child
is
about
a
130,000,
i
guess.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
18
miles.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
yes.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
that's
correct.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
it
has
given
me
considerable
alarm
since
i
agreed
that
my
brother
lawyers
from
the
other
cities
for
that
feeling
on
our
part
that
that
might
prejudice
their
situations,
and
so
i
must
be
very
careful
to
point
out
that
in
different
cities,
different
results
must
follow
that
no
general
rule
can
be
pronounced
here
in
my
mind
that
can
be
generally
applicable.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
i
said
it,
yes.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
that's
right.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
let
me
add
this
comment
upon
that
statement
there,
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
didn't
stop
thinking
when
i
completed
the
brief
is
this.
that
this
is
being
tried
completely
and
virtually
completely
without
a
reference
and
one
reason
it
is
being
less
tried
one
reason
why
he
left
out
of
this
record
here
is
a
considerable
portion
of
the
testimony
which
sustain
the
adoption
of
the
step
of
the
one
grade
a
year
plan.
that
is
we
sustain
a
reasonableness
of
slowing
down
the
process
of
desegregation
is
that
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
case
raise
only
the
point
of
constitutionality.
there
was
no
denial
of
proof
of
the
existence
of
adequate
proof
to
sustain
a
reasonable
slowing
down
of
the
transition
to
desegregation
as
had
been
suggested
by
the
supreme
court
as
wise
measures
in
the
places
where
it
was
violated
tradition
and
so
on.
and
consequently,
the
knoxville
board
did
act
as
a
transition
matter
in
adopting
this
whole
plan
which
is
composed
of
various
consistently
fitting
together
pieces
including
the
step
bar
--
the
grade
by
year
plan
coupled
with
the
transfer
plan
all
of
them
operating
these
limitations,
adopted
after
deliberation
as
reasonable
procedures
to
assure
the
undisturbed
and
efficient
and
effective
success
of
the
compliance
to
the
supreme
court's
order.
so
we've
ended
up
here
without
our
own
record,
the
nashville
situation
ends
up
without
the
record
that's
really
pertinent
in
this
case
because
there's
not
one
syllable
here
from
the
record
in
the
nashville
case,
the
kelley
case,
this
is
all
davidson
county
case
and
this
apparently
population
figured,
they're
completely
different.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
well,
that's
the
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
well,
i
say
this
your
honor
that
i
think
the
considered
conclusion
should
be
that
the
termination
of
this
plan
in
knoxville
should
await
a
full
detail
study
and
decision
by
the
school
board,
and
a
full
trial
at
the
local
level
in
the
local
schools.
now
frankly,
i've
been
accused
of
being
too
candid
here
in
formulating
the
answer
that
was
put
in
and
also
in
writing
this
little
brief.
but
when
this
petition
came
up
and
the
question
was
represented,
i
advice
the
client
at
home
it
would
be
far
wiser
for
you
to
make
this
case
moot
and
add
to
your
payroll
and
encounter
some
administrative
burdens
and
so
on
to
then
subject
yourself
to
the
peril
of
the
supreme
court
specifying
local
rules
of
operation.
though
the
supreme
court
is
somewhat
remote
from
our
home
and
we
think
that
maybe
within
from
local
experience
might
be
helpful
in
determinations
of
what
this
--
what
should
be
done
there.
and
as
a
--
rather
as
a
legal
matter
in
response
to
that
suggestion
on
my
part
instead
of
as
a
conclusion
of
their
own,
coming
as
to
a
factual
in
investigation
of
the
facts
if
this
brief
was
formulated
in
--
at
the
outset,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
might
be
true.
i
wasn't
thinking
about
the
constitutional
validity
of
this
plan
at
that
state
to
begin,
but
it
may
well
be
true
that
the
racial
ground
alone
without
any
particular
prejudice
but
the
naked
ground
of
race
is
an
adequate
ground
for
transfer
on
the
theory
that
it
--
a
good
thing
to
have
in
the
balancing
of
interest
and
the
encouragement
of
individual
thinking
even
if
it
amounts
to
individual
discrimination.
this
denial
of
the
right
to
choose
companions
may
create
a
handicap
to
the
development
of
the
negro
race
itself.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
no,
not
at
all.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
it's
the
good
thing
of
the
government
to
encourage
individual
thinking
and
individual
choices
that
includes
--
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
that's
right.
but
here
that
isn't
--
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
out
of
this
case,
it
shouldn't
arise
any
rules
which
penalizes
the
right
of
the
individual
to
make
his
own
decision,
to
do
his
own
choosing
of
things
on
some
theory
that
it
becomes
state
action
at
some
point.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
after
a
reasonable
time.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
your,
your
honor
--
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
your
honor
that's
pure
speculation
in
the
world.
now,
the
question
that
we've
talked
about,
what
is
the
period
of
transition?
and
for
the
first
time
i
heard
the
phrase
affirmative
mixing
or
integrations,
social
acceptance
and
everything
else.
when
that
comes
about,
certainly,
we
are
through
with
the
theory
of
transition.
it
may
be
that
the
12-year
period
or
now
a
seven-year
period
of
the
completed
of
--
getting
through
all
the
grades
in
the
knoxville
public
school
will
complete
the
period
of
transition.
and
in
one
sense
it's
an
awful
long
time
to
await
complete
integration.
your
honor,
the
answer
is
that
you
can
get
us
in
a
plan
like
this
and
throw
it
away
when
you
don't
need
it
anymore,
when
you
got
to
--
it's
a
sense
of
security
that
the
people
are
going
to
be
reconciled
to
each
in
the
classroom.
that
you're
going
to
be
a
free
interplay
of
whites
and
blacks
without
the
difference
and
color
making
any
particular
difference.
and
i
think
we're
making
great
strides
towards
that.
we've
shattered
a
color
line
that
used
to
be
a
complete
block.
and
in
other
respects
transportation
and
all
activities
in
town,
the
negroes
are
progressing,
restaurants
are
open,
the
coliseum
that's
recently
built
is
open
to
them,
parks,
playgrounds
and
so
on.
and
considerable
progress
is
being
made
and
we're
trying
to
do
the
best
we
can
to
help
but
there
is
a
far
underlying
that
community
has
proven
in
the
clinton
case
which
burned
out
federal
district
judge
down
there
and
he's
on
ease
as
exhibited
in
his
opinion.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
judge
taylor.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
yes.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
in
clinton
case
and
he
wasn't
shocked
--
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
the
knox
county,
is
it
not?
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
mr.
--
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
judge
miller,
deputy
miller.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
william
miller,
right.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
well,
that
95
was
--
219
was
from
nashville.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
well,
dr.
burkhart
is
the
drawn
witness
and
he
was
in
the
hands
of
a
very
capable
attorney.
now,
that's
the
reason
for
whatever
cast
there
is
upon
those
questions
and
answers
because
i
say
the
doctor
is
a
doctor
and
he
is
not
a
witness,
he's
not
a
professional
school
board
member.
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
i'd
say
that
--
mr.
s.
frank
fowler
that
describes
the
board
but
i'd
also
say
that
the
board
thinks
this,
that
if
this
plan
is
constitutional
they
strongly
prefer
it,
this
transfer
plan
which
gives
a
choice
to
the
parents
to
withdraw
from
--
to
the
racial
majority.
