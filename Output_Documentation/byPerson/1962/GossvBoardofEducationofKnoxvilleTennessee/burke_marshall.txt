mr.
burke
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
start
by
stating
briefly
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
these
cases.
these
are
the
first
school
desegregation
cases
which
the
court
has
taken
for
argument
since
cooper
against
aaron.
the
united
states
participated
in
cooper
against
aaron,
and
also
in
the
brown
cases
both
on
the
merits
and
on
relief.
so
our
participation
in
these
cases
reflects
a
continuing
national
policy.
the
cases
themselves
involved
an
important
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
transfer
provisions
in
knoxville
in
davidson
county,
tennessee
which
operate
explicitly
on
the
grounds
of
race.
put
in
their
most
favorable
light,
these
transfer
rules
are
designed
to
permit
children
of
both
races
to
avoid
the
effects
of
desegregation,
although,
as
i
shall
develop,
in
doing
so,
they
also
compelled
children
to
go
to
particular
schools
because
of
their
race.
the
transfer
rules
reflect
to
some
degree,
the
deep-seeded
fears
of
some
parents
in
these
places
and
elsewhere
in
the
area
of
desegregation.
the
legal
assumption
behind
the
rules
is
that
the
school
boards
may
give
effect
to
these
fears
in
the
administration
of
the
school
districts
by
permitting
transfer
of
children
depending
upon
their
race
and
depending
upon
the
majority
--
of
the
race
of
the
majority
of
the
other
children
in
the
school.
in
our
view,
this
legal
assumption
is
wrong,
and
it
derives
from
presumptions
about
race
which
undermine
the
brown
case.
the
presumptions
being
that
it
is
harmful
for
children
of
both
races
to
go
to
school
together
and
it
is
a
proper
aim
of
government
to
take
steps
that
design
to
permit
them
to
go
to
school
separately.
the
united
states
is
also
interested
in
these
cases
because
the
situations
which
are
presented
in
them
are
not
unique.
the
states
of
alabama,
arkansas,
north
carolina,
louisiana,
and
florida,
all
have
statutes
which
are
--
which
say
in
effect
that
no
child
of
either
race
may
against
his
wishes
be
compelled
to
go
to
a
school
where
he
will
be
in
the
minority
racially.
in
addition,
transfer
plans
of
this
sort
have
been
introduced
in
other
cities.
they
are
now
in
effect
in
nashville,
in
memphis,
and
humphrey
county
in
tennessee,
and
were
included
but
turned
down
by
the
courts
in
chattanooga
and
obion
county.
in
virginia,
they
are
now
a
part
of
the
plans
in
lynchburg,
arlington,
alexandria,
and
warren
county.
and
in
virginia,
they
were
also
included
but
turned
down
by
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
charlotte's
bill
plan.
so
there
is
presented
the
possibility
that
if
these
rules
are
proved
in
these
cases
that
they
will
spread
and
become
a
part
of
the
pattern
of
desegregation
throughout
the
entire
area
of
desegregation
under
the
brown
case.
these
rules
start
with
an
unquestioned
use
of
racial
criteria.
they
treat
children
differently,
depending
solely
upon
their
race.
white
children
may
transfer
when
negroes
may
not.
and
negroes
may
transfer
when
whites
may
not.
the
other
side
of
that
coin
--
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
correct.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
--
that's
correct
too,
mr.
justice
white.
the
other
side
of
that
is
that
the
white
child
may
transfer
out
of
the
school,
but
the
negro
must
stay
there.
the
school
board
not
only
moves
the
white
child
out,
it
makes
the
negro
child
stay
in
the
school
and
the
same
way
with
the
--
when
the
negro
child
moves
out
and
the
whites
have
come.
mr.
burke
marshall
on
the
face
of
the
rule,
mr.
justice
black
as
i
understand
it,
and
on
the
face
of
the
plan,
a
negro
child
and
a
white
child
are
both
assigned
to
a
school
in
a
school
district.
the
negro
child
must
go
to
that
district,
because
he's
assigned
there.
the
white
child
may
move
automatically
before
he
ever
attends
the
school,
if
he's
in
the
minority
or
if
the
school
was
previously
an
all
negro
school,
either
way.
and
of
course
the
rule
does
not
depend
on
how
much
of
a
minority
he's
in.
it
might
be
49%,
51%
or
something
like
that.
mr.
burke
marshall
it
works
--
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
burke
marshall
that
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
treats
children
differently
in
all
schools.
in
schools
which
were
formed
--
mr.
burke
marshall
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
is
a
discrimination
against
the
negroes
in
a
particular
school.
mr.
burke
marshall
in
another
school.
mr.
burke
marshall
but
not
in
that
school.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
correct.
that's
in
knoxville.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right,
mr.
justice
white.
but
it
does
not
treat
negro
children
and
white
children
alike.
when
you
look
at
any
particular
school
district,
if
you
take
a
school
district
where
the
majority
is
negro,
the
negro
children
in
that
school
district
must
go
to
the
school
in
that
district.
the
white
children
do
not
have
to
go
to
the
school
on
that
district.
mr.
burke
marshall
but
that
does
not
--
that
does
not
in
my
judgment,
mr.
justice
stewart,
cure
the
discrimination
against
the
negro
children
in
the
school
district
which
i
chose.
those
negro
children,
each
has
a
constitutional
right
not
to
be
treated
unequally
because
of
his
race.
and
he's
being
made
to
go
to
a
school
because
of
his
race,
where
white
children
who
are
exactly
in
the
same
circumstance
are
not
made
to
go
to
that
school.
that
is
the
discrimination.
it
is
not
an
answer
to
that
discrimination.
under
the
cases
and
decisions
of
this
court
to
say
that
in
another
school
district,
negro
children
may
decide
not
to
go
to
a
school
that
white
children
have
to
go
to.
mr.
burke
marshall
it
runs
throughout
the
entire
school
district
mr.
justice.
mr.
burke
marshall
yes,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
it
permeates
the
entire
school
system
--
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right,
mr.
justice
white.
we
have
a
series
of
cases
--
have
had
a
series
of
some
voting
cases
in
louisiana,
one
of
which
came
to
this
court.
in
tho
--
under
louisiana
law,
private
citizens
may
go
in
and
purge
voters
from
the
record
if
they
haven't
--
if
they're
not
qualified
in
the
judgment
of
the
private
citizens.
there
was
about
a
--
six
years
ago,
a
series
of
purges
in
the
number
of
parishes
in
louisiana,
all
initiated
under
louisiana
law
by
the
private
citizens.
but
the
courts
have
ordered
the
negroes
that
were
purged
from
the
roles
under
those
circumstances
restored
to
their
roles
because
the
purge
was
discriminatory
in
the
sense
that
whites
were
not
purged
at
the
same
time
as
negroes,
even
though
the
impetus
came
from
the
decision
of
a
private
individual.
i
think
the
burton
case,
which
this
court
decided
two
years
ago
is
another
analogy.
in
the
burton
case,
a
private
restaurant
man
was
given
the
use
of
state
property
in
wilmington
and
he
discriminated.
it
was
his
private
decision
but
he
did
it
through
state
property,
public
property,
property
that
was
supposed
to
be
used
for
the
public,
and
this
court
struck
that
down.
i
think
another
analogy
is
the
girard
college
case
where
the
--
mr.
girard
wanted
to
set
up
a
college
for
whites
only
but
he
did
it
using
the
machinery
of
the
state
and
this
court
struck
that
down
because
the
state
machinery
itself
was
the
instrument
of
discrimination.
and
so
here,
i
do
not
think
that
the
school
board
can
avoid
the
fact
that
it
is
what
is
assigning
these
children
to
school,
not
the
parents.
the
school
board
is
assigning
children
to
school
and
even
it's
assigning
children
to
school
differently
depending
upon
their
--
whether
they're
white
children
or
negro
children.
mr.
burke
marshall
mr.
justice
stewart,
whatever
the
reason
for
the
school
board
doing
it,
whatever
its
reason,
it
is
the
school
board
that's
doing
it,
not
the
parent.
mr.
burke
marshall
i
say,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
the
school
board
cannot,
whatever
the
wishes
of
the
parents,
cannot
assign
children
differently
to
different
schools
depending
on
the
race.
mr.
burke
marshall
nevertheless,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
school
board
is
running
the
school
system.
mr.
burke
marshall
it
is
deciding,
not
the
parents.
it
is
deciding
whether
it's
based
on
the
wish
of
the
parents
or
not.
it
has
to
decide.
it
cannot
avoid
the
authority
deciding
where
--
what
school
--
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
burke
marshall
and
what
school
the
children
in
the
school
district
must
go
to.
now,
when
it
grants
that
request,
it
is
putting
a
white
children
--
white
child
the
school
because
he's
white,
and
a
negro
child
and
exactly
the
same
circumstances
has
to
go
to
a
different
school
because
he
is
negro.
mr.
burke
marshall
i
think,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
--
that
same
school
board
is
assigning
a
number
of
negro
children.
we
will
take
the
school
district
which
is
say
40%
white
and
60%
negro.
mr.
burke
marshall
now,
the
school
board,
under
this
plan,
assigns
all
those
children
to
the
school
in
the
school
district
without
regard
to
their
race.
mr.
burke
marshall
the
negro
children
in
that
school
district
are
compelled
to
go
to
that
school.
now,
that's
a
compulsion
by
the
state
to
make
them
go
to
that
school.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
burke
marshall
no,
but
the
school
board
has
to
decide
where
the
negro
children
go
to
school
and
where
the
white
children
go
to
school.
it
decides
the
negro
children
have
to
go
to
that
school
in
that
district
and
that
the
white
children
do
not
have
to
go
to
school
in
that
district.
now,
that
is
a
decision
made
by
the
state,
solely
on
the
basis
of
race
and
i
do
not
think
the
school
board
can
avoid
its
constitutional
responsibility
for
having
made
that
decision
by
saying
that
it
derives
from
the
wishes
of
the
parents
anymore
than
the
city
of
philadelphia
could
avoid
what
it
did
in
the
girard
college
case
by
saying
it
all
derived
from
the
wishes
of
mr.
girard.
mr.
burke
marshall
no.
no,
i
don't,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
i
think
there
is
a
constitutional
rule
that
children
must
be
treated
equally,
under
the
law,
without
regard
to
--
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
burke
marshall
no,
it
would
not,
mr.
justice
clark.
that
is
a
different
case.
mr.
burke
marshall
if
mr.
justice
stewart,
everyone
in
the
school
district
could
transfer
out,
that
would
be
a
different
case.
but
that
is
not
this
case
under
this
case.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right
--
well,
whatever
is
--
whatever
the
motivation
of
the
parent
in
both
moore
and
louisville
now,
whatever
the
motivation
of
the
parent,
any
child
can
transfer
to
another
school.
the
limits
on
that
that
controls
on
it
and
the
administration
of
the
school
district
have
to
do
with
how
big
the
school
is,
how
many
teachers
it
has,
how
big
these
classrooms
are,
and
the
priorities
who
applied
first.
now,
that
kind
of
control
has
nothing
to
do
with
race.
and
if
that
kind
of
transfer
plan
we're
working
here,
there's
no
contention
that
the
school
board
would
have
the
duty
to
inquire
in
to
the
motives
of
the
parents.
mr.
burke
marshall
no,
that
is
not
our
position.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
i
did
not
so
understand
it,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
--
but
a
--
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
the
school
board
cannot
treat
children
differently
because
of
their
color.
mr.
burke
marshall
well
i
think,
mr.
justice
white
it
--
mr.
burke
marshall
i
think
that
if
the
school
board
has
a
free
transfer
system,
so
that
anyone
can
transfer
whatever
his
reasons
then
he
--
then
both
those
transfers
would
be
permitted
and
that
isn't
the
school
board
would
not
have
to
inquire
behind
into
the
motives
and
that
the
parents
volunteered
the
motive
i
think
that
would
--
mr.
burke
marshall
no,
mr.
justice
douglas.
and
of
course
the
--
every
school
system
as
i
was
discussing
with
mr.
justice
stewart
has
to
have
rules,
it
can't
escape
the
responsibility
for
telling
where
children
they
should
go.
now,
if
the
rules
permit
free
transfer
and
the
limits
of
the
rules
are
on
how
many
school
they
have
and
how
many
classrooms,
and
who
applied
first
and
that
kind
of
nonracial
criteria
then
the
motives
of
the
parents
don't
seem
to
me
enter
into
it
at
all.
mr.
burke
marshall
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
that
these
rules
work
that
way.
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
rules
work.
beyond
that
though
because
a
negro
child
under
these
rules
who
is
assigned
in
a
school
district,
where
the
school
was
formerly
all
negro
has
to
stay
there
whether
he
believes
in
segregated
schools
or
not,
he
has
no
right
to
transfer
no
matter
how
much
he
believes
in
integrated
school.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right,
negro
or
white.
mr.
burke
marshall
well
between
--
in
each
school
though,
mr.
justice
harlan,
it
is
a
discrimination
and
unequal
treatment
as
between
whites
and
negroes.
negroes
have
to
go
to
a
school
because
they
are
negro
when
whites
who
are
otherwise
and
exactly
the
same
circumstance,
except
for
their
race
do
not
have.
now,
in
another
school
district,
that
happens
the
other
way
around.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right,
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
racial
discrimination
--
mr.
burke
marshall
no.
no,
mr.
justice
harlan,
it's
because
of
his
race.
he
can't
go
to
an
integrated
school
because
he's
white.
that's
why,
because
he's
white
and
he's
in
a
school
which
is
--
in
which
he
is
not
a
racial
minority,
it's
because
of
his
color.
mr.
burke
marshall
well
--
mr.
burke
marshall
they
are
frozen
in
a
school
with
the
majority
of
the
race
because
of
their
race,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
it's
because
of
their
race.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
the
objection,
the
objection
is
to
refusing
transfer,
similar
transfer
rights
to
the
--
mr.
burke
marshall
--
racial
majority
--
mr.
burke
marshall
and
you
can't
do
that,
you
can't
do
that
unless
you're
adjudicating
the
transfers
on
the
basis
of
race,
and
our
position
is
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
forbids
that.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
correct,
because
of,
because
of
--
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right,
mr.
justice
stewart
but
because
of
his
race,
he
is
not
allowed
to
transfer
whereas
others
have
a
different
race
are.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
burke
marshall
well,
i
think
it
would,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
wanted
to
make
this
caveat
when
we're
talking
about
other
kinds
of
plans
that
the
school
board
might
devise.
we
--
it's
a
very
difficult
to
discuss
these
plans
in
a
vacuum
and
when
the
plan
of
that
sort
of
comes
up,
it
will
come
up
on
a
record
and
in
a
school
district
which
is
resisting
desegregation
it
may
be
that
the
circumstances
would
show
that
the
purpose
in
effect
of
that,
despite
its
equality
of
treatment
on
its
face
was
discriminatory.
after
all,
this
case
and
all
of
these
cases
come
up
from
a
court
order
and
the
court
order
requires
the
school
board
to
give
the
plaintiffs
their
right
which
is
a
right
under
the
brown
cases
and
cooper
against
aaron
to
attend
desegregated
school
system.
and
when
the
school
board
acts
in
a
way
that
doesn't
accomplish
that
which
they
are
ordered
to
do
by
the
court,
i
think
it
goes
beyond
the
constitutional
questions
on
phases,
it's
whether
--
it's
compliance
with
the
court
order.
because
as
i
understand
the
brown
case,
the
second
brown
decision,
it
is
--
that
is
what
the
school
boards
are
ordered
to
do
to
create
a
desegregated
school
system
operated
and
in
accordance
with
the
constitution.
and
the
steps
that
go
away
from
that
are
not
permitted
under
the
brown
decision.
in
fact
there
--
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
this
as
a
transitional
plan,
i
think
that
what
we
have
been
discussing
are
terms
of
its
prominent
constitutionality
but
if
you
look
at
it
there's
a
transitional
plan,
i
think
that
the
brown
case
absolutely
controls
it.
because
the
brown
case
required
school
boards
to
move
towards
a
desegregated
school
system.
it
put
that
as
an
affirmative
duty
on
them
and
it
listed
the
kinds
of
things
which
would
permit
delays
in
that
process.
mr.
burke
marshall
but
that
is
not
what
i'm
talking
about
either,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
in
this
case
about
compulsory
integration.
that's
not
involved
at
all.
mr.
burke
marshall
it
is
keeping
people
in
particular
segregated
schools
because
of
their
race.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
burke
marshall
i
--
as
i
read
the
brown
case,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
talked
about
school
systems
that
are
upgraded
in
a
fashion
in
which
children
are
not
treated
differently
because
of
their
race.
and
this
plan
treats
children
differently
throughout
the
system
because
of
their
race.
sometimes
that
operates
to
keep
white
children
in
schools,
sometimes
it
operates
--
mr.
burke
marshall
but
it
is
government
action,
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
constitutional
terms.
the
school
board,
the
school
board
under
these
transfer
rules,
it
is
the
school
board
that
decides
what
school
a
child
can
go
to.
mr.
burke
marshall
but
mr.
justice
stewart,
what
triggers
the
action
of
the
school
board
doesn't
make
it
--
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
school
board's
action
isn't
still
stayed
action
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
as
i
said,
it
is
like
the
burton
case
and
the
girard
college
case,
and
these
purge
cases
where
the
school
board
is
still
an
instrumentality
of
the
state
which
is
treating
children
throughout
the
school
--
mr.
burke
marshall
and
denying
transfer
is
also
though,
mr.
justice
stewart.
because
every
time
they
grant
a
transfer
to
a
member
of
the
minority
race,
they
are
saying
at
the
same
time
that
all
the
children
of
the
other
race
in
that
same
school,
who
are
under
exactly
the
same
circumstances
in
every
respect
except
for
the
race
cannot
transfer.
they
are
keeping
children
in
school
as
well
as
permitting
them
to
move
from
school
to
school.
they
are
assigning
them.
this
compulsion
of
the
state
is
on
a
negro
to
make
him
stay
in
a
school,
when
the
white
does
not
have
to
stay
in
the
same
school
and
the
only
difference
is
that
one
is
white
and
one
is
negro.
mr.
burke
marshall
no,
there
were
not,
mr.
justice
black
in
--
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right,
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
it
is
not
only
a
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
these
transfer
plans
in
a
vacuum
but
also
a
question
of
compliance
with
the
court
order
under
the
brown
cases.
mr.
burke
marshall
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
that
is
argued
in
our
brief
and
that's
our
position.
the
district
courts
--
i
think
that
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
was
introduced
in
either
of
these
cases
which
supports
this
transfer
provision
as
a
step
towards
desegregation
under
the
brown
cases.
and
as
far
as
the
courts
are
concerned,
neither
of
the
district
courts
really
discussed
the
transfer
provision
in
those
terms
at
all.
the
court
in
the
knoxville
case
didn't
discuss
it
at
all.
it
--
and
the
davidson
county
case
thought
it
was
found
by
the
previous
decisions
of
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
correct,
justice
black.
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
after
the
12
grades
are
desegregated,
the
school
boards
will
be
faced
with
almost
as
difficult
the
problem
as
they
started
with,
to
comply
with
the
constitution.
mr.
burke
marshall
i
think,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
sixth
circuit,
when
it
upheld
it,
that
treated
it
as
a
transitional
plan
because
it
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
district
court
can
supervise
and
retain
jurisdiction,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
it's
a
transitional
plan
except
that
it
is
part
of
the
plan
filed
by
the
--
mr.
burke
marshall
that's
right.
and
so
on.
