mr.
frank
i.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
dismissal
of
an
indictment
by
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california.
the
issue
it
presents
is
a
simple
one;
whether
section
1
of
the
elkins
act
is
violated
when
the
transportation
manager
of
a
shipper
solicits
from
a
carrier
a
personal
kickback
not
for
the
benefit
of
his
employer,
the
shipper,
but
for
his
own
personal
benefit.
the
facts
alleged
in
the
indictment
are
briefly
these.
the
andrew
jergens
company
manufactures
and
sells
cosmetics
and
toilet
articles.
it
maintains
a
branch
warehouse
and
distribution
center
in
burbank,
california
from
which
it
ships
its
merchandise
in
interstate
commerce.
jerry
braverman,
the
appellee,
was
employed
by
jergens
as
the
transportation
manager
of
its
burbank
branch.
during
the
period
in
question
here,
roughly
from
january
to
march
1962,
jergens
made
a
number
of
shipments
to
points
in
the
pacific
northwest,
utilizing
the
services
of
superior
fast
freight
company,
a
freight
forwarder
subject
to
the
provisions
of
part
iv
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
indictment
alleged
that
on
three
separate
occasions
during
this
period,
braverman,
the
appellee
had
knowingly
solicited
from
employees
of
superior,
rebates
and
concessions,
which
if
granted
would
have
resulted
in
the
transportation
of
jergens'
property
at
a
rate
lower
than
that
prescribed
in
the
official
published
tariff
of
superior.
the
first
such
rebate
was
in
the
amount
of
2%
of
the
freight
revenues
to
be
derived
by
superior
from
carrying
jergens'
property.
the
second
rebate
was
in
the
amount
of
$200
and
the
third
was
in
the
amount
of
$150
for
every
$3,000
of
freight
revenues,
which
superior
would
earn
from
carrying
jergens'
merchandise.
on
the
morning
of
the
trial
and
before
the
empanelment
of
the
jury,
judge
mathis
invited
counsel
to
the
bench
and
there
conferred
with
them
as
to
the
legal
merits
of
the
indictment.
counsel
for
the
government
conceded
that
so
far
as
this
evidence
showed,
the
rebate
or
concession
had
been
solicited
solely
for
the
personal
benefit
of
the
appellee,
not
for
jergens'
benefit.
on
that
ground,
judge
mathis
dismissed
the
indictment
issuing
a
minute
order
in
which
he
said
that
in
as
much
as
no
benefit
was
intended
for
jergens,
the
indictment
failed
to
charge
a
crime
under
the
elkins
act.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
so
far
as
i
know,
it
was
not.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
i
don't
believe
it
would
mr.
chief
justice.
now
the
statute
that
we
are
concerned
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
the
record
doesn't
show
that
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
statute
we
are
concerned
with
is
set
forth
on
page
two
of
the
government's
brief.
the
pertinent
part
begins
about
nine
lines
down
and
reads
as
follows.
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person,
persons
or
corporation
to
offer,
grant,
or
give,
or
to
solicit,
accept
or
receive
any
rebate
concession
or
discrimination
in
respect
of
the
transportation
of
any
property
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
by
a
common
carrier
subject
to
the
act,
whereby
any
such
property
shall
by
any
device
whatever
be
transported
at
a
less
rate
than
that
named
in
the
tariffs
published
and
filed
by
such
carrier.
if
appellee's
counsel
were
represented
here,
i
would
expect
him
to
argue
two
things.
first,
he
would
argue
that
the
term
rebate
connotes
necessarily
a
payment
to
the
shipper
himself
and
not
to
some
third
person
such
as
the
shipper's
agent.
secondly,
he
would
argue
that
unless
the
payment
is
made
to
the
shipper
himself
there
is
no
departure
from
the
published
tariff
rate.
in
effect,
the
shipper
pays
the
full
rate,
the
carrier
receives
the
full
rate
and
the
fact
that
the
carrier
thereafter
pays
out
a
portion
of
his
receipts
as
a
personal
bribe
to
the
shipper
in
no
way
effects
the
rate
which
he
has
received.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
essentially
the
argument.
the
argument
is
that
this
is
essentially
similar
to
a
brokerage
commission
or
an
advertising
expense.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
exactly
and
which
raises
his
costs
but
doesn't
in
anyway
reduce
his
rate.
in
support
of
this
statutory
construction,
the
appellee
would
argue
that
the
sole
purpose
of
the
elkins
act
was
to
protect
shippers
against
discrimination.
its
purpose
was
to
ensure
that
all
shippers
were
treated
alike.
in
developing
the
government's
argument,
i
propose
to
make
three
principal
points.
first,
that
the
language
of
the
statute
on
its
face
is
broad
enough
to
cover
the
transaction
involved
here.
secondly,
that
from
the
standpoint
of
protecting
carriers
against
the
dissipation
of
their
revenues
and
against
extortionate
demands
at
the
hands
of
persons
in
control
of
routing,
shipping
in
interstate
commerce,
it
makes
absolutely
no
difference,
whether
the
rebate
is
solicited
by
the
agent
for
his
own
benefit
or
for
his
employers'
benefit.
and
thirdly,
that
even
the
policy
of
protecting
shippers
against
discrimination
would
be
seriously
weakened
if
the
distinction
urged
by
the
appellee
were
accepted.
first,
as
to
the
language
of
the
statute
itself;
we
believe
that
the
term
rebate
has
no
such
restricted
technical
meaning
as
the
appellee
would
assign
to
it.
the
statute
doesn't
define
it.
it's
not
defined
with
any
precision
in
the
cases
as
far
as
i
know.
but
in
common
parlance,
i
would
think
that
the
term
rebate
was
at
least
broad
enough
to
cover
a
kickback,
an
under
the
table
kickback
to
the
buyer
of
transportation
services.
now
in
this
case,
braverman
was
not
the
buyer
of
transportation
services
in
the
sense
that
he
paid
for
them
out
of
his
own
pocket
only
jergens
did
that.
but
he
was
the
buyer
in
the
sense
that
it
was
he
who
controlled
the
or
at
least
i
presume
that
is
was
he,
he
being
the
transportation
manager,
who
controlled
the
routing
of
jergens'
property
in
interstate
commerce.
it
was
he
who
selected
the
carrier
which
would
carry
the
merchandise.
we
think
that
a
kickback
to
such
a
person
would
certainly
qualify
as
a
rebate.
and
even
if
it
wouldn't,
the
term
concession
also
appears
in
the
statute.
i
would
think
that
the
term
concession
has
no
such
limitations
that
might
conceivably
be
attributed
to
the
term
rebate.
secondly,
it
is
our
position
that
regardless
of
whether
the
money,
regardless
of
whether
the
rebate
is
retained
by
the
shippers
agent
or
passed
on
to
the
shipper
himself,
the
effect
upon
the
carrier
is
still
that
of
depriving
him
of
a
portion
of
the
rate.
from
the
standpoint
of
the
carrier
and
its
revenues,
it's
completely
immaterially
what
happens
to
the
money
after
the
transportation
manager
gets
it.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
don't
believe
that
congress
squarely
focused
on
this
problem
at
all.
for
the
most
part
the
principle
purpose
of
the
elkins
act
i
frankly
concede
was
to
protect
shippers
and
not
to
protect
carriers
as
such.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
railroads
were
among
the
principle
supporters
of
this
act.
it
was
recognized
at
the
time
that
the
railroads
were
as
much
the
victims
as
the
villains
of
this
practice.
and
that
for
the
most
part,
they
had
no
choice
but
to
comply
with
the
demands
that
were
made
upon
by
them
by
the
larger
shipping
trusts
if
they
expected
to
stay
in
business
at
all.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
so
as
far
as
i
know
mr.
justice
goldberg,
there
would
be
no
federal
criminal
statute.
it
may
well
be
that
this
is
a
violation
of
a
state
anti-bribe
law,
although
i
don't
believe
that
california
has
such
a
statute.
california
does
have
an
anti-rebate
statute
which
reads
in
term
similar
to
the
federal
statute.
and
of
course,
this
conduct
would
be
a
breech
of
the
employees'
fiduciary
duty
to
his
employer.
i'll
return
to
the
legislative
history
in
a
few
moments
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
perhaps
answer
your
question
fully.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
if
it
we
are
not
for
the
federal
statute
here,
which
will
make
it
a
crime
for
the
employer
to
attempt
to
recover
this
money
from
the
employee
on
the
ground
that
it
would
then
be
receiving
a
rebate,
but
were
not
for
that
statute.
i
think
that
it's
fairly
clear
in
the
california
law
that
the
employer
could
recover
the
sums
from
the
employee.
that
as
to
say
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
you
mean
the
shipper
in
this
case?
i
would
doubt
it
mr.
justice
white,
because
i
would
suppose
that
if
the
shipper
were
to
accept
the
money,
it
would
then
be
guilty
i
would
suppose
of
receiving
a
rebate.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
possibly
by
operation
of
law
the
shipper
might
be
able
to
recovery
on
ordinary
agency
law
of
principles.
and
certainly
as
i
say,
that
would
be
the
case
if
there
were
no
federal
statute
here.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
if
the
shipper
would
get
the
money
i
certainly
think
it
would
be,
yes
sir.
in
candor,
i'm
not
persuaded
that,
that
would
be
the
result.
it
seems
to
me
perhaps
even
more
reasonable
to
give
the
money
back
to
the
railroad.
now
apart
from
the
language
of
the
--
oh,
there's
one
another
point
i
want
to
emphasize
in
this
connection.
the
statute
does
not
in
terms
require
that
any
discrimination
be
shown
in
favor
of
a
particular
shipper,
nor
does
it
require
even
that
a
benefit
be
shown
in
favor
of
a
particular
shipper.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes,
now
i
interpret
that
language
mr.
justice
white
as
meaning
an
advantage
to
the
shipper.
i
think
that
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
legislative
purpose
to
protect
any
one
shipper
from
gaining
an
advantage
over
another
shipper.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
the
foregoing
words
are
departures
from
the
--
foregoing
words
are
whereby
any
such
property
shall
by
any
device
whatever
be
transported
at
a
less
rate
than
that
named
in
the
tariffs.
now,
i
don't
believe
that,
that
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
i
--
that's
certainly
a
possible
construction
of
the
language
sir.
needless
to
say
it's
not
our
construction.
one
of
the
principle
purposes
of
this
statute
was
to
dispense
with
the
requirement
which
existed
under
the
original
interstate
commerce
act
to
compel
the
government
to
prove
in
each
case
that
there
had
actually
been
discrimination
in
favor
of
a
shipper.
it
was
because
that
burden
of
proof
turned
out
to
be
impracticable
in
practice,
that
the
elkins
act
was
passed.
it
was
recognized
first
that
in
practice
the
government
could
rarely
prove
that
not
only
had
a
rebate
been
given
to
the
particular
shipper
in
question
but
that
the
same
rebate
had
been
denied
other
shippers,
so
that
there
has
been
discrimination.
it
was
also
recognized
that
in
many
cases
there
had
in
fact
had
been
no
discrimination
in
the
practice
of
rebates
at
that
time.
in
particular
the
commission
had
investigated
the
meat
packing
industry
in
chicago
and
kansas
city
and
they
discovered
that
while
virtually
every
pound
of
beef
that
had
moved
out
of
those
cities
for
many
years
had
traveled
at
rates
substantially
below
the
published
tariff,
nonetheless
every
shipping
company
had
received
exactly
the
same
amount.
so
that
in
the
statutory
sense
there
has
been
no
discrimination.
so
the
principle
innovation
which
was
rocked
by
the
elkins
act
was
to
make
it
unnecessary
to
show
discrimination
and
to
make
the
gravamen
of
the
offense
be
any
departure
from
the
published
tariff.
the
real
question
then
is
whether
or
not
there
had
in
this
case
been
a
departure
from
the
published
tariff.
that
question
i
submit
should
be
considered
in
the
light
of
two
statutory
policies.
the
first
statutory
policy
is
one
of
protecting
carriers
not
shippers,
but
carriers
against
the
extortion
of
demands
upon
their
revenues
and
against
a
distortion
of
their
competitive
practices.
now
this
purpose
was
not
the
major
purpose
of
the
elkins
act
itself.
it
was,
however,
i
think
a
minor
purpose.
professor
sharplin
who
was
the
leading
authority
as
the
court
knows
on
the
interstate
commerce
act,
has
described
the
elkins
act
in
the
following
terms.
this
measure
was
enacted
on
the
initiative
of
the
railroads
themselves
as
a
means
of
conserving
their
revenues
and
was
generally
regarded
from
the
public
standpoint
quite
as
much
a
necessary
instrument
for
curbing
the
unconscionable
tactics
of
the
so
called
trusts
in
extorting
special
favors
from
the
carriers,
as
it
was
a
desirable
extension
of
federal
authority
over
the
railroad.
so
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
this
was
at
least
a
secondary
consideration
at
the
time
the
elkins
act
was
passed.
since
that
time
the
protection
and
conservation
of
carrier
revenues,
the
economic
well
being
of
the
transportation
system
and
the
elimination
of
destructive
competitive
practices
had
become
a
matter
of
increasing
and
crucial
legislative
concern.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no
sir,
i
think
that
would
probably
not
be
a
rebate
and
i
think
it
can
be
distinguished
from
a
bribe
to
the
shipping
agent,
in
at
least
one
respect
and
possibly
more.
the
traditional
function
of
a
rate
reduction
is
to
offer
an
inducement
to
the
buyer
of
transportation
services
to
purchase
the
services
of
that
particular
carrier.
now
i
take
it
that
the
extortion
that
would
be
practiced
by
the
labor
organizer
or
an
ordinary
brokerage
commission
to
a
broker
would
not
serve
that
function.
it
would
not
be
an
inducement
to
the
buyer
of
transportation
services.
a
rebate
to
the
shipper
does
play
that
role
and
so
does
a
bribe
to
the
shipping
agent
who
was
in
charge
of
actually
routing
the
shippers'
goods
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
i
think
so
yes
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
and
perhaps
even
more
specifically
the
person
who
actually
is
responsible
for
making
the
decision
as
to
whether
the
carrier
will
be
given
the
business.
i
might
say
that
there
other
distinctions
that
occurred
between
the
extortion
by
the
labor
organizer
and
the
extortion
by
the
carrier's
agent,
and
it
lies
in
this
that
in
terms
of
its
impact
upon
competing
carriers,
i
would
think
that
a
great
deal
more
damage
would
be
done
to
the
business
of
competing
carriers,
which
might
otherwise
be
able
to
attract
a
portion
of
the
shipper's
business
if
under
the
table
kickbacks
were
paid
to
the
agent
of
the
shipper,
than
if
they
were
paid
to
say
a
broker
and
i
would
think
also
the
labor
organizer,
i
haven't
thought
that
through.
now
the
policy
of
protecting
carriers
and
serving
their
revenues
and
ensuring
that
there
are
no
unfair
competitive
practices
among
them
has
as
i
say
grown
an
importance
since
the
elkins
act
was
passed.
since
that
time
the
commission
has
been
given
the
power
to
prescribe
minimum
rates
as
well
as
maximum
rates.
and
it
now
may
disallow
proposed
rate
reductions
on
the
ground
that
they
would
be
destructive,
competitive
practices
or
on
the
ground
that
they
would
be
non-remunerative
to
the
proponent
carrier.
this
development
was
--
this
development
culminated
in
1940
with
the
declaration
of
the
national
transportation
policy
by
congress,
which
congress
proclaimed
that
it's
a
vowed
objective,
the
elimination
of
destructive
competitive
practices,
the
preservation
of
inherent
advantages
of
each
carrier,
and
in
general
the
protection
of
the
carrier
system.
congress
concluded
that
declaration
by
saying
that
all
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
be
administered
and
enforced
with
a
view
to
carrying
out
the
objectives
of
this
policy.
now
technically
the
elkins
act
is
not
a
part
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
as
i
believe
we
mistakenly
implied
in
our
brief.
it's
a
separate
act,
the
title
of
which
is
an
act
to
further
regulate
commerce.
nonetheless
it
clearly
is
part
of
the
overall
scheme
of
carrier
regulation
and
legislation
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
it
should
be
construed
in
such
a
way
as
to
effectuate
the
policy
of
that
scheme.
now
let
me
give
you
an
example
to
show,
how
the
policy
of
that
scheme
would
be
completely
frustrated
if
practices
such
as
this
were
allowed
to
go
unpunished.
suppose
you
have
two
carriers,
a
railroad
and
a
motor
carrier.
each
of
them
has
fully
distributed
cost
of
$0.25
for
a
particular
movement
on
a
particular
commodity.
each
of
them
is
charging
a
rate
of
exactly
$0.25,
just
enough
to
recover
the
cost
including
return
on
their
investment.
under
those
circumstances
if
the
railroad
were
now
to
try
to
reduce
its
rates
in
order
to
put
its
competitor
out
of
business,
the
commission
would
clearly
disallow
the
reduction
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
destructive
competitive
practice
non-compensatory
et
cetera.
the
railroad
tried
to
achieve
exactly
the
same
purpose
by
paying
a
rebate
to
the
shipper,
exactly
the
same
result
would
obtain
only
this
time
that
would
clearly
be
a
violation
of
the
elkins
act.
now
in
our
view
the
railroad
should
not
be
permitted
to
achieve
that
result
by
paying
secret
inducements
to
the
agent
of
the
shipper
anymore
than
by
paying
secret
inducements
to
the
shipper
himself.
yet
under
the
opposing
view,
the
appellees'
view
of
this
case,
the
result
would
be
that
the
commission
would
be
completely
helpless
to
prevent
that
kind
of
practice.
relief
if
any
would
have
to
be
obtained
at
state
law.
now
i
think
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
mr.
chief
justice
i
see
no
escape
from
that
conclusion.
i
see
no
escape
from
that
conclusion,
because
essentially
in
both
cases
the
problem
would
be
to
construe
the
term
rebate,
and
also
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
result
would
be
that
the
shipper's
goods
was
being
transported
at
a
rate
lower
than
that
prescribed
in
the
published
tariff
and
in
the
appellees'
view,
those
conditions
would
not
be
met
and
the
statute
would
not
be
violated,
nor
so
far
as
i
am
aware
would
any
other
federal
statute
be
violated.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
exactly,
the
elkins
act
really
recapitulates
and
embraces
prohibitions,
which
are
contained
in
the
original
interstate
commerce
act.
i
think
it
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
right,
which
it
certainly
has
power
to
do,
and
which
courts
can
do
under
various
penal
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
quite
independently
of
the
elkins
act.
now
even
if
one
views
this
case
solely
from
the
standpoint
of
protecting
shippers,
not
protecting
carriers,
and
ensuring
a
quality
of
treatment
among
all
shippers,
we
would
still
maintain
that,
that
policy
cannot
be
effectuated
if
the
distinction
proposed
here
is
made.
in
the
first
place
even
in
cases
where
the
agent
retains
the
rebate
himself
and
doesn't
pass
it
on
to
his
employer,
the
employer
may
still
derive
various
indirect
benefits.
that
is
to
say
the
money
which
money
which
the
agent
extorts
from
the
carrier,
he
might
otherwise
have
demanded
from
the
shipper
in
the
form
of
higher
salaries.
i
think
it's
quite
well
known
that
in
the
restaurant
business
for
example,
the
universal
practice
of
tipping
waiters
and
waitresses
has
resulted
in
a
depression
in
the
salaries
of
waiters
and
waitresses.
in
fact,
i've
even
heard
it
said
that
in
new
york
night
clubs
the
head
waiter
actually
has
to
pay
for
the
privilege
of
keeping
his
job.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
i
would
suggest
two
answers
to
that
to
question
mr.
justice
goldberg.
in
the
first
place
it
certainly
wouldn't
apply
to
the
situation
where
the
initiative
is
taken
by
the
railroad,
i
should
think
or
by
the
carrier.
and
secondly
as
far
as
the
situation
where
there
is
some
semblance
of
extortion
by
the
shipping
agent,
i
like
you,
i'm
a
little
bit
bewildered
by
the
concluding
phrase
about
under
color
of
official
right.
now,
the
essence
of
this
case
is
that
he
has
not
solicited
the
rebate
in
his
capacity
as
a
transportation
manager.
he
is
not
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
office
as
it
were.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
ryan
case
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
would
ask
though
whether
not
the
money
was
extorted
for
the
benefit
of
the
rail
--
of
the
labor
union
in
that
case.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
in
that
case
the
situations
would
perhaps
be
parallel.
i
don't
know
whether
this
would
meet
the
description
of
--
meet
the
statutory
test
of
extortion
under
the
hard
fact
or
not.
now
there
are
two
other
reasons
why
i
don't
think
that
the
policy
of
protecting
shippers
could
be
carried
out
if
the
decisions
below
were
affirmed.
first
of
all,
you
would
almost
never
able
to
convict
a
carrier
if
the
decision
were
affirmed
even
if
there
were
a
benefit
to
the
shipper,
because
in
every
case
the
carrier
upon
paying
the
rebate
could
demand
assurance
perhaps
even
written
assurance
from
the
shipper
that
the
money
would
be,
from
the
agent,
that
the
money
would
retained
by
the
agent
and
not
passed
on
to
the
shipper.
and
then
even
if
by
some
miracle
the
government
were
able
to
trace
the
proceeds
from
the
shipping
agent
to
the
shipper
himself,
the
carrier
would
still
have
an
impregnable
defense,
namely
that
he
didn't
intend
the
money
to
go
to
the
shipper,
that
he
paid
it
on
condition
that
it
would
not
go
to
the
shipper.
and
i
should
think
that
under
those
circumstances
there
would
really
be
nothing
that
the
prosecutor
could
respond.
finally
even
as
far
as
convicting
shippers
are
concerned
where
benefits
have
actually
been
received
by
shippers,
i
would
think
that
it
was
virtually
impossible
in
most
cases
for
the
government
to
trace
the
proceeds
from
the
agent
to
his
employer.
the
route
by
which
the
money
passed
from
one
to
the
other
could
readily
be
disguised,
it
could
be
circuitous,
there
could
be
complex
secret
arrangements
between
the
two
parties
for
example
involving
adjustments
in
the
salary
of
the
shipping
agent
which
would
virtually
preclude
conviction
i
would
think.
now
it
seems
to
me
very
difficult
to
believe
that
congress
which
enacted
this
statute
in
order
to
close
all
loopholes
in
the
way
of
enforcing
the
prohibitions
against
discriminatory
benefits,
should
have
wished
its
language
to
be
construed
so
narrowly
as
to
leave
open
a
loophole
of
this
kind,
and
that
an
act
which
was
passed
in
order
to
relieve
the
government
of
impracticable
burdens
of
proof
should
be
construed
in
such
a
way
as
to
impose
somewhat
different
one,
but
one
which
is
equally
impracticable.
finally,
i
might
point
out
until
the
decision
below,
every
lower
federal
court
which
had
considered
this
question,
had
resulted
in
the
government's
favor.
in
fact
only
three
years
after
the
elkins
act
was
passed
the
southern
district
of
new
york
dealt
with
a
case
which
was
almost
on
all
force.
that
case
which
is
the
lackawanna
railroad
case
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
appears
at
152
fed
i
believe,
involved
an
indictment
against
the
carrier
for
paying
a
bribe
to
the
shipping
agent.
and
the
carrier
made
the
defense
there
that
the
benefit
had
not
accrued
to
the
shipper,
but
only
to
his
agent
and
that
therefore
elkins
act
was
not
violated.
southern
district
of
new
york
held
that
nonetheless
the
indictment
lay.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no
your
honor
i
don't
believe
it
did.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
i
can't
remember
it,
now
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i've
concluded
my
argument.
