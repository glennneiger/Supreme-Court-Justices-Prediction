how
many
ju
--
how
many
jurors
are
present?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
of
them
--
which
one
of
them
had
the
most
experience
in
mechanics
in
a
--
even
with
railroad
and
things
out
to
--
where
the
people
lived
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
you
didn't
take
evidence
on
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
--
i
have
12
jurors
and
one
judge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
actually
had
12.
one
jury
didn't
want
give
him
this
much
money.
that
was
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
of
course
has
not
been
--
this
is
a
photograph
of
another?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
jury
believed
contrary
to
your
argument,
this
man
did
see
this
thing
did
move,
would
you
still
say
that
there's
no
question
for
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
that
an
issue
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
reason
for
foreseeability
that
there
would
be
movement
and
no
reasonable
foreseeability
that
it
would
injure,
which
is
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
just
one
question
just
to
clear
in
my
mind
about
e
on
page
120,
this
picture.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
that
this
coil
is
what
the
man
was
handling
when
you
said
he
was
hurt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
coil.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
heavy
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
109
pounds.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
men
was
supposed
to
lift
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one?
from
what
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
both
of
them
are
working
on
it
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
made
it
fly
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
was
it
--
it
was
the
coil?
was
it
sort
of
flip
out
or?
there
must
have
been
some
explanation
in
the
evidence
as
to
why
it
flew
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
why
would
it
--
how
much
pressure
did
he
have
to
put
on
it
to
hold
it?
and
why
did
he
have
to
put
pressure
on
it
to
hold
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
it?
what
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
makes
the
wheel
bring
it
up
so
that
there
is
pressure,
what
hold
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
upward
on
the
wheel?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
had
a
110-pound
pressure.
and
this
man
was
standing
there
trying
to
hold
it
in
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
why
do
you
say
that
there'd
be
no
evidence
of
foreseeability
then
that
a
man
handling
a
110-pound
thing
like
that
might
slip
out
to
either
a
109-pound
pressure.
justice
hugo
l.
black
wasn't
--
couldn't
it
be
foreseeable
that
he
might
get
hurt.
is
this
one
--
if
something
they
have
in
the
way,
he
has
to
take
his
hand
off
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understand
you're
defending
on
ground
beyond
that
because
i
asked
you
what
really
happened
if
they
actually
saw
it
move
and
did
move.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
wouldn't
make
out
a
case.so,
there's
no
reason
for
the
railroad
to
foresee
that
a
man
might
got
hurt
--
might
get
hurt
if
the
thing
did
move
while
the
man
was
holding
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
did
move,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
naturally
moved
out
of
there
pretty
fast.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
were
charged
with
negligently
injuring
him
when
that
thing
hit
him,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright,
he
carefully
submitted
the
negligence
charge,
was
that
it
moved.
you
say
that
it
didn't
move.
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
that
it
did
move,
i
understood
you
to
go
further
and
say
the
railroad
had
no
reason
to
think
if
it
did
move,
just
like
it
did,
that
the
man
might
not
hurt
somebody
and
they
shouldn't
guard
against
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
as
a
matter
of
law
that
you
were
asking
to
be
held
that
the
--
nobody
could
reasonably
foresee
it
if
this
man
might
get
hurt
if
the
thing
moved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whatever
moved
and
hit
him.
what
hit
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
says
it
hit
him
because
the
thing
moved.
you
say
that
there's
no
reasonable
foreseeability
on
the
part
of
the
rail
--
that
the
railroad
couldn't
reasonably
foresee
that
if
it
did
move,
precisely
as
he
said
it
did,
and
all
the
evidence
showed
it
that
you
would
still
say
that
it
couldn't
have
been
foreseen
that
the
men
might
get
hurt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
not
the
movement
charged
but
that's
--
a
movement
also
occurred.
there's
no
doubt
that
that
movement
occurred,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
now,
let's
assume
that
is
the
(inaudible)
--
at
the
time
that
--
just
before
it
happened,
there
was
a
movement
of
this
other
thing
like
they
said,
a
sudden
movement.
the
man
was
there
holding
and
it
was
a
109-pound
operator
--
operation.
do
you
say
that
the
railroad
couldn't
have
reasonably
foreseen
if
it
left
that
thing
there,
subject,
it
was
movable,
it
was
moving,
might
move
and
knew
that
the
man
would
be
working
on
that
heavy
thing
at
that
time,
that
they
couldn't
reasonably
foreseen
that
the
man
might
get
hurt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
then,
you
are
arguing
--
you
are
arguing
now
that
there's
not
enough
evidence
that
it
moved.i
understand
that
--
i
understand
that
argument
but
i
was
getting
to
the
foreseeability.
