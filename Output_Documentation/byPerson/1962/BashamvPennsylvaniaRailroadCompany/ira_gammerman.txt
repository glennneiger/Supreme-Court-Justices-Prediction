mr.
ira
gammerman
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
employers'
liability
act
case,
which
was
tried
initially
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york,
kings
county
before
the
court
and
jury.
the
jury
returns
the
verdict
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
in
the
amount
of
$15,000.on
the
respondent's
motion
the
trial
judge
set
that
verdict
aside
and
also
granted
respondent's
motion
to
direct
the
verdict
for
the
defendant,
the
railroad.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals,
the
appellate
division
of
the
state
of
new
york.
and
that
court
affirmed
the
action
of
the
trial
judge
by
a
vote
of
four
to
one.
a
further
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
albany.
that
court
affirming
the
action
of
the
trial
court
unanimously.
as
i've
mentioned
this
is
a
federal
employers'
liability
act
case.
the
petitioner
at
the
time
of
the
accident
was
an
employee
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad,
the
respondent.
the
accident
occurred
in
january
of
1956.
the
petitioner
was
working
for
the
respondent
as
a
car
repairman
helper
in
the
respondent's
sunnyside
yard
in
new
york
city.
in
those
yards
the
respondent
maintains
wheel
pits.
these
are
pits
which
are
used
by
respondent's
employees
to
remove
old
wheels
from
railroad
cars
and
install
new
ones.
the
pit
itself
is
very
similar
to
a
grease
pit
underneath
an
automobile.
that
is,
if
they
cleared
out
the
space
between
the
running
rails
on
which
the
railroad
car
sits
so
that
the
men
can
get
down
into
the
space
from
three
or
four
feet
and
work
beneath
the
car.
the
wheels
are
replaced
by
moving
the
car
over
the
pit
and
rolling
underneath
the
car
a
movable
hoist
to
a
jack
which
is
attached
to
a
movable
platform
which
rolls
at
the
bottom
of
the
pit.
the
hoist
is
then
raised
to
the
level
of
the
wheels.
the
wheels
are
disconnected
from
the
car,
lowered
to
the
bottom
of
the
pit
and
rolled
out.
the
old
wheels
are
replaced
by
new
wheels
which
are
again
rolled
underneath
the
car
on
this
movable
platform
and
raised
by
the
hoist
to
the
point
at
which
they
can
be
securely
and
firmly
affixed
to
the
railroad
car.
it
was
the
job
of
the
petitioner
to
assist
in
this
operation
being
performed
that
one
of
these
three
pits.
that
his
job
at
the
time
of
the
accident
was
to
stand
on
this
wooden
movable
platform
and
hold
with
both
hands
a
rather
heavy
spring
as
the
new
wheels
were
being
raised
to
be
placed
in
position
where
they
could
be
securely
affixed
to
the
car.
as
he
was
doing
this,
the
platform
on
which
he
was
standing
suddenly
shifted
or
moved
causing
him
to
lose
his
balance.
mr.
ira
gammerman
that's
correct.
the
--
mr.
ira
gammerman
the
petitioner
put
out
his
hand
to
regain
his
balance
when
the
spring
that
he
had
formerly
been
holding
jumped
out
and
fell
on
his
hand
then
he
sustained
the
injuries.
i
think
it's
important
to
the
case
and
the
issues
to
discuss
just
for
a
moment
the
apparatus
that
was
being
used.
starting
from
the
top
and
down
there
is
the
railroad
car
which
sits
on
the
rails
which
straddle
this
pit.
extending
down
from
the
body
of
the
car
and
attached
to
the
car
are
two
pedestals
or
a
pedestal
linings,
i'll
refer
to
them
as
pedestals.
these
are
u-shaped
receptacles
into
which
a
portion
of
the
wheel
assembly
which
is
being
raised
from
the
bottom
of
the
pit
fits.
mr.
ira
gammerman
yes.
yes
mr.
justice
stewart.
they
are
shown
in
the
plaintiff's
exhibit
1
on
page
113.
that's
a
photograph
of
the
wheel
pit
of
the
car
and
the
pedestals,
the
pedestals
are
the
u-shaped
receptacles
extending
down
from
the
body
of
the
car.
this
incidentally
is
a
photograph
taken
after
the
wheels
have
been
fully
installed
and
secured,
that
is
attached
to
the
car.
mr.
ira
gammerman
well,
it's
a
little
--
it's
somewhat
difficult
on
that
photograph
to
see
it.
perhaps
you
can
see
better
on
page
117,
which
is
defendant's
exhibit
b,
which
shows
the
receptacles
at
a
point
at
which
the
wheels
were
being
raised
into
the
position
to
which
they
will
be
secured
to
the
car.
you
see
that
there's
--
there
are
some
chalk
letters
ss
smith
on
one
side
of
the
receptacle.
mr.
ira
gammerman
now,
into
these
receptacles
as
being
raised,
the
wheel
assembly,
the
wheel
assembly
consists
of
a
--
an
axle
with
two
wheels,
one
wheel
on
each
end.
and
outside
of
each
wheel
is
a
journal
box,
which
is
a
lubricating
device.
that's
the
device
that's
apparent
on
page
113,
on
the
outside
of
the
wheels
just
above
the
rail
on
the
photograph,
plaintiff's
exhibit
1.
now
that
wheel
assembly
is
being
raised
by
a
lift.
the
lift
consists
of
a
vertical
member
and
a
crossbar
or
tee
at
the
ends
of
which
are
two
v-shaped
prongs
into
which
the
axle
fits.
the
crossbar
is
attached
to
the
upright
portion
of
the
lift
by
a
nut.
and
there's
motion
at
that
point
that
is
the
bar
on
which
the
wheels
rest
can
tip.
now,
as
the
wheels
are
being
raised,
the
journal
boxes,
that
is
--
these
lubricating
boxes
on
the
wheel
assembly
slipped
into
the
receptacles
and
are
raised
further
and
further
into
the
receptacles
until
they
fit
all
the
way
up
into
the
receptacles
and
it
--
at
that
point,
that
the
wheels
are
secured
to
the
car.
now,
that
certain
--
mr.
ira
gammerman
--
point
--
mr.
ira
gammerman
that's
right.
mr.
ira
gammerman
they
are
permanently
affixed
to
the
car.
mr.
ira
gammerman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
ira
gammerman
yes.
mr.
ira
gammerman
no.
there
are
--
there
are
certain
facts
which
are
not
disputed.
there
was
a
movable
platform.
that
is
the
platform
on
which
the
petitioner
was
standing
was
movable.
it
could
move
some
11
feet
in
one
direction
and
some
three
inches
in
another
direction.
mr.
ira
gammerman
the
platform?
no.
i
think
the
--
the
only
photograph
that
gives
some
sort
of
hint
of
it
is
on
page
116,
which
shows
the
crossbar.
mr.
ira
gammerman
that's
correct.
that
crossbar
goes
down
some
three
or
four
feet
and
is
attached
to
a
movable
platform.
that's
the
platform
that
the
petitioner
was
standing
on
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
as
i
said,
there's
no
dispute
that
there
was
motion
at
the
point
shown
in
defendant's
exhibit
a
on
page
116
marked
with
the
initial
“n”.
that's
the
nut
that
attached
to
the
crossbar
to
the
upper
right
portion
of
the
hoist.
it
was
--
there's
no
dispute
that
at
the
time
of
the
accident
the
wheel
assembly
had
been
raised
to
a
point
where
the
journal
boxes
were
partially
inserted
into
these
pedestals.
i
believe
there
were
in
about
one
quarter
of
the
way.
there's
no
dispute
that
they
have
not
been
fully
raised
and
that
the
wheel
assembly
had
not
been
as
yet
firmly
secured
to
the
railroad
car.
and
there's
no
dispute
that
there
was
some
motion
possible
at
the
ends
of
the
wheel
assembly
even
after
the
journal
boxes
were
inserted
into
the
pedestals.
it's
the
extent
of
this
motion
that
constitutes
the
issue
of
fact
that
was
raised
between
the
parties.
now
as
i've
said,
the
petitioner
testified
that
as
he
was
standing
on
the
platform
during
this
operation
it
suddenly
shifted.
he
also
testified
that
there
was
motion
both
at
the
juncture
of
the
upper
right
and
the
crossbar
and
motion
at
the
ends
of
the
axle
when
the
journal
boxes
were
inserted
into
the
pedestals.
a
mechanic,
employed
by
the
respondent
some
seven
or
eight
years
working
in
these
pits,
also
testified.
and
testified
that
at
the
time
of
the
accident,
he
too
saw
the
platform
on
which
the
petitioner
was
standing
moved.
he
testified
that
the
motion
was
present
at
the
two
points
that
the
petitioner
testified
to.
and
he
testified
that
because
of
this
very
situation,
he
himself
at
a
safety
meeting
held
before
this
accident
had
complained
about
this
condition
to
the
foreman,
that
is
the
railroad
foreman.
and
that
in
response
to
the
complaint,
a
safety
device
in
the
form
a
hook-and-eye
had
been
stalled
in
one
of
the
three
pits
in
the
yard
to
hold
the
platform
in
position,
but
that
no
safety
device
or
no
clamp
or
hook-and-
eye
had
been
installed
in
this
particular
pit.
so
the
railroad
counted
the
testimony
by
producing
one
of
its
assistant
foreman
who
testified
as
an
expert
but
testified
solely
based
on
his
experience,
that
is,
he
was
not
an
engineer
and
brought
no
engineering
background
to
his
testimony.
he
testified
that
in
his
experience,
there
was
not
this
one
to
two
inches
of
movement
as
testified
by
the
petitioner
at
the
point
at
which
the
journal
boxes
were
inserted
into
the
pedestals.
but
that
the
movement
was
only
a
quarter
of
an
inch.
and
that
therefore
in
his
opinion,
the
movement
was
limited
to
a
quarter
of
an
inch
at
the
platform
level
and
that
the
platform
could
not
move.
that's
a
--
disputed
fact
was
raised
with
respect
to
the
snugness
of
the
pit,
the
snugness
of
the
pit
between
the
journal
box
and
the
pedestals.
the
railroad
assistant
foreman
testified
that
the
pit
was
quite
snug
indeed.
the
petitioner
and
the
mechanic
testified
that
the
pit
was
not
quite
as
snug
as
testified
by
the
railroad
foreman,
it
was
some
one
to
two
inches.
i
submit
that
this
was
a
disputed
fact
which
was
resolved
by
the
jury
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
but
the
trial
court
however,
resolved
the
dispute
otherwise.
mr.
ira
gammerman
and
five
in
the
appellate
division.
mr.
ira
gammerman
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
ira
gammerman
that's
correct.
mr.
ira
gammerman
i
want
to
point
out
however
that
the
--
the
only
opinion
that
was
written
in
this
case
was
the
opinion
of
the
trial
judge
who
cited
not
one
federal
employers'
liability
act
case.
he
cited
--
mr.
ira
gammerman
the
verdict,
it
was
11
to
one
in
favor
of
petitioner.
all
12
agreed
as
to
the
verdict,
11
agreed
as
to
the
amount.
it
was
the
12th
ju
--
mr.
ira
gammerman
that
that
--
mr.
ira
gammerman
i
think
we're
even.
we
figured
that
out
before
we
came
here.
mr.
ira
gammerman
i
really
don't
recall
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
ira
gammerman
no.
mr.
ira
gammerman
the
trial
court
--
and
that's
the
only
opinion,
we
have
decisions
of
both
the
appellate
division
and
the
court
of
appeals.
but
the
trial
court
obviously,
if
you
--
on
reading
it's
--
on
reading
it's
opinion,
resolved
an
issue
of
fact.
the
--
and
i
think
the
trial
court
recognized
that
because
when
the
respondent's
attorney
moved
that
the
conclusion
of
the
plaintiff's
case,
that's
on
page
54
of
the
record,
there
was
a
motion
made
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
and
the
respondent's
attorney
argued
to
the
trial
court
that
the
platform
could
not
move
because
the
journal
box
has
been
partially
inserted
into
the
pedestal.
the
trial
court
stated,
and
i'm
quoting,
“i
have
witnesses
who
came
here
and
said
that
it
moved
and
could
move.
now,
if
you
have
expert
testimony
to
the
contrary,
that
may
become
an
issue
of
fact.”
well,
the
railroad
did
have
expert
testimony
to
the
contrary.
and
that
did
become
an
issue
of
fact.
and
i
submit
that
that's
all
it
was.
it
resolved
one
way
by
the
jury,
the
opposite
way
by
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
was
obviously
evaluating
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
here.
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court
deals
at
some
length
with
a
test
--
a
statement
introduced
by
the
respondent
taken
from
the
mechanic,
that
was
the
man
in
charge
of
the
pit
who
said
that
the
platform
moved,
he
saw
it
moved,
and
that
--
there
was
sufficient
mobility
or
movability,
or
play,
that
is
the
pit
was
not
as
snug
as
the
foreman
had
said
it
was.
and
the
trial
court
in
characterizing
the
statement
and
i'm
reading
from
the
trial
court's
opinion,
which
is
on
page
124
of
the
record,
stated,
“further,
the
testimony
of
the
--
of
petitioner's
fellow
employee”,
that's
the
mechanic,
“was
directly
contrary
to
his
prior
written
statement
given
immediately
after
the
accident
in
which
he
blamed
the
accident
on
petitioner's
carelessness
and
exculpated
the
defendant
railroad
from
any
negligence.”
the
trial
court
also
in
its
opinion
stated
that
the
railroad's
evidence
that
the
platform
was
immovable
was
not
rebutted
by
petitioner
when
the
fact
was
that
petitioner
testified
specifically
an
answer
to
questions
on
a
cross-examination
by
the
railroad
counsel,
that
the
platform
was
movable,
that
the
journal
boxes,
when
they
fit
into
the
pedestals,
did
not
fit
that
snuggly,
and
that
the
mechanic
had
testified
to
the
same
effect.
the
appellate
division,
although
it
wrote
no
opinion,
published
a
decision
and
the
decision
picks
up
the
language
of
the
trial
court
and
states
that
there
was
uncontroverted
proof
that
the
platform
could
not
move.
i
submit
that
the
trial
court
and
both
the
appellate
courts
were
in
effect
weighing
the
credibility
of
evidence
in
doing
what
this
court
has
said
in
lavender
against
kurn,
“is
an
undue
invasion
of
the
province
of
the
jury.”
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york,
which
appears
on
page
15
of
the
petitioner's
appendix,
deals
at
considerable
length
with
the
so-called
contradictory
statement.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statement
is
almost
completely
summarized
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
i've
cited
in
my
brief,
the
cases
of
this
court,
dealing
with
this
question,
that
is
lavender
against
kurn,
wilkerson
against
mccarthy,
the
rogers
case,
the
schulz
case,
and
this
court
within
the
last
30
days
or
so
has
decided
at
least
two
cases
on
this
very
point,
the
gallick
case
and
the
harrison
case.
the
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
fact
issues
which
are
raised
in
this
f.e.l.a
cases
are
to
be
resolved
by
the
jury,
not
by
the
trial
court
and
not
by
the
appellate
courts.
here,
the
trial
court
and
the
appellate
courts
weighed
the
testimony
and
resolved
these
fact
issues
in
favor
of
the
railroad.
the
jury
came
to
the
opposite
conclusion
and
i
submit
that
it's
the
jury's
decision
on
these
fact
issues
that
should
stand.
mr.
ira
gammerman
well,
i
don't
want
to
labor
this
point
about
the
12
juror.
i
tried
the
case,
and
i
spoke
to
the
jury,
and
the
juror
who
voted
for
the
defendant
told
me
that
he
wanted
to
award
10,000
instead
of
15,000.
in
answer
to
the
point
mr.
mountan
discussed
with
you
mr.
chief
justice,
the
evidence
was
that
the
petitioner
was
not
an
inexperienced
workman.
he
had
done
this
work
--
mr.
ira
gammerman
the
evidence
was
that
the
petitioner
was
not
an
inexperienced
workman.
he
had
done
this
type
of
work
holding
this
spring
in
position
on
many,
many
occasions
prior
to
the
night
of
the
accident.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
foreseeability,
there
was
evidence
in
the
record,
specific
testimony
that
a
complaint
had
been
made
and
the
complaint
had
been
made
not
about
another
pit
or
not
about
this
pit
but
about
the
pits
in
general.
the
question
was
asked
of
the
mechanic
whether
or
not
he
has
made
a
complaint
at
a
safety
meeting.
he
said
he
has
and
he
complained
that
the
platform
moved.
he
happened
to
be
working
at
another
pit
and
incidentally
the
record
indicates
that
the
pits
were
all
alike.
he
happened
to
be
working
in
another
pit
at
the
time
he
made
the
complaint
and
it
was
in
that
pit
that
the
safety
device
was
installed.
perhaps,
if
he
had
been
working
in
this
pit,
the
safe
--
when
the
complaint
was
made,
the
safety
device
hadn't
--
wouldn't
have
been
installed
in
this
pit.
the
pits
were
one
right
next
to
the
other
on
three
adjacent
tracks.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
platform
could
move
really
depends
on
the
distance
between
the
flanges
and
this
pedestal.
that
is
how
tightly
does
the
flange
gripped
the
pedestal.
the
photographs
that
mr.
mountan
discussed
show
the
outside
of
the
flange
against
the
pedestal.
there
is
nothing
in
the
photograph
which
indicates
whether
or
not
there
was
a
quarter
of
an
inch
between
the
flanges
and
the
pedestals
or
two
inches
between
the
flanges
and
the
pedestal.
the
respondent's
foreman
or
the
assistant
foreman
who
testified
said
that
it
gripped
it
so
that
there
was
only
a
quarter
of
an
inch.
the
petitioner
and
the
mechanics
said
that
it
didn't
grip
it
that
tightly
at
all.
that
there
was
about
two
inches
and
that
the
whole
thing
was
not
secured
until
it
was
raised
up
to
the
point
where
the
wheels
were
attached
to
the
car.
and
then
it
was
secured,
and
at
that
point
there
couldn't
be
any
movement.
but
it's
not
disputed
that
at
this
point,
during
this
stage
in
the
operation
the
wheels
were
not
secured
to
the
car
and
that
the
only
thing
that
was
limiting
movement
was
these
pedestals
around
the
flange.
mr.
ira
gammerman
well,
this
is
again
arguing
to
the
jury
but
i
argue
to
the
jury
that
you
had
an
imbalance
in
pressure.
there
was
evidence
that
the
fact
that
the
wheels
when
they
raised
--
would
raised
at
an
unequal
rate
so
that
the
wheels
on
one
side
were
raising
or
could
raise
at
a
speed
higher
than
the
wheels
on
the
other
side.
that
is
--
that
was
the
significance
of
that
tipping
in
the
crossbar.
when
the
wheels
were
raised
--
if
the
wheel
on
one
side
make
some
resistance,
there
will
be
a
considerable
pressure
to
the
wheel
on
the
other
side
to
move
up
suddenly.
and
when
the
wheel
on
the
other
side
moved
up
suddenly,
the
platform
would
shift
a
little
bit
to
equalize
that
imbalance
between
the
wheels,
and
that
was
what
caused
the
--
that
was
--
nobody
knows
precisely
what
caused
the
platform
to
move.
that's
what
i
argued
to
the
jury
and
that's
what
the
jury
obviously
accepted.
the
facts
were
all
there
to
support
that
argument.
a
complaint
had
been
made
about
this
dangerous
condition
and
something
had
been
done
but
unfortunately
not
in
this
particular
pit.
