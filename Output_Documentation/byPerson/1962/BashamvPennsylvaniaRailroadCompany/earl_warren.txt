chief

warren
mr.
gammerman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
this
is
mr.
mountan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
their
testimony
is
to
how
far
it
could
move
on
those
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
a
testimony
that
he
only
held
it
with
one
hand?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
that
petitioner
said
that
in
adjoining
pit,
the
hook-and-eye
arrangement
was
used
to
lock
the
hoist
platform
in
place
so
it
would
not
move.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
there
was
no
such
--
there
--
was
there
any
such
hook-and-eye
arrangement
in
this
pit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
one
in
the
other
pit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
a
time
there
was.
why
wasn't
there
one
in
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
there
had
--
they
had
a
safety
device
in
one
and
did
not
have
one
in
the
other.
and
the
mechanic
called
it
to
the
attention
of
his
superiors
but
nothing
was
done
about
it.
is
that
a
fair
observation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
unfair
about
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
an
issue
of
fact.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
--
let's
just
say
that
--
talk
about
preventing
motion
at
any
time
because
it's
contended
here
that
this
platform
couldn't
move.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
there
was
a
safety
device
in
the
other
to
prevent
it
from
moving
at
times
when
it
was
dangerous
to
those
working
there.
why
wasn't
anyone
in
this
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i'm
--
i
understand
from
the
record
that
the
mechanic
testified
that
he
had
told
his
supervisor
about
the
danger
of
moving
platforms
and
has
called
his
attention
to
the
absence
of
any
device
from
preventing
platform
movement
in
pit
number
3.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
his
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
--
is
there
anything
in
there
to
indicate
it
was
different?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
what
hand
was
it
that
was
injured?
chief
justice
earl
warren
will
you
take
a
look
at
your
exhibit
e
on
120,
they
are
placed
in
--
tell
me
if
it
is
quite
probable
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
situation,
this
man
would've
put
his
right
hand
inside
between
that
109-pound
spring
and
the
frame
work
of
the
cavity
it
which
it
was
fitting
and
have
taken
his
left
hand
out
in
order
to
hold
it
in
there.
you
can
see
that
he
is
pressed
right
up
against
both
the
spring
and
against
the
flange
that
comes
out
there
to
the
extent
that
it
either
pulls
his
--
his
coach
sleeve
up
or
he's
going
down
and
would
he
be
inclined
to
hold
that
109-pound
spring
in
that
--
in
that
place
and
leave
his
left
hand
disengaged?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
just
asked
you
now
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
and
you've
been
probably
been
around
those
shops
too.
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
would
a
man
try
to
hold
that
thing
in
that
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
would
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
probably
the
jury
didn't
believe
that
he
had
ever
said
that
to
the
foreman,
who
was
testifying
for
the
company.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
quite
understand
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
