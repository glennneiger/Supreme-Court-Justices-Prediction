mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
mr.
mountan.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
yes
sir.mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
record
in
this
case
at
page
100
indicates
that
the
verdict
is
11
to
one
for
the
plaintiff
in
the
sum
of
$15,000.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
there
were
12
jurors
for
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
and
i
would
like
to
point
that
out
to
the
court.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
i
don't
recall
what
the
fact
was.
actually,
your
honor,
i
do
recall
that
we
spoke
to
the
jurors
afterwards.
it
was
not
my
recollection
that
the
12
juror
was
for
the
plaintiff.
there
is
a
very
interesting
story
as
to
how
the
jurors
arrived
to
this
verdict
but
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
not
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
goldberg
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
that
it
is.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
it
is
sir.
there
are
two
questions
in
the
position
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
which
are
to
be
decided
by
this
honorable
court.
the
first
is
whether
or
not
the
platform
in
fact
did
move.
the
second
is,
assuming
for
the
moment
that
it
did
move,
was
it
reasonably
foreseeable
that
the
platform
could
move
and
would
move
in
such
a
way
as
to
cause
a
petitioner
such
as
the
one
in
this
particular
case,
harmed?
and
i
point
to
the
very
reason
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
gallick
case
in
which
the
court
held
that
reasonable
foreseeability
of
harm
is
an
essential
ingredient
of
federal
employers'
liability
act
negligence.
as
to
the
first
question,
was
there
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
jury
finding
that
the
platform
on
which
the
petitioner
was
standing
moved?
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
i
have
none.
i
have
none
your
honor.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
absolutely.
i
have
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
well,
i
believe
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
yes.
i
don't
believe
that
there
was
a
specific
charge
in
foreseeability
as
such
but
certainly
it
was
with
--
included
within
the
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
no,
i
did
not.
not
on
that
point
mr.
justice
white.
now,
insofar
as
the
first
question
is
concerned,
was
there
sufficient
evidence?
as
petitioner's
counsel
has
pointed
out,
the
petitioner,
a
car
repairman
helper
in
the
employer,
the
respondent
railroad,
was
working
with
three
other
employees
in
the
number
three
wheel
pit
of
the
respondent's
sunnyside
yard
in
long
island
city
at
approximately
2:15
a.m.
on
january
7,
1956,
engaged
in
changing
a
pair
of
wheels
on
a
passenger
car.
at
pages
114
to
120
of
the
record
are
printed
photographs
of
the
type
of
equipment
involved
in
the
operation
which
the
petitioner
and
his
fellow
employees
were
engaged
in.
the
various
photographs
show
various
of
the
stages
involved
in
the
operation
of
changing
a
set
of
wheels.
and
i
might
point
out
that
the
photographs
themselves
are,
in
my
humble
opinion,
the
most
convincing
evidence
that
we
have
in
this
case,
that
the
platform
did
not
in
fact
move.
i
refer
to
plaintiff's
exhibit
2,
which
is
printed
at
page
114
of
the
record.
this
is
a
photograph
which
shows
either
the
work
completed
or
the
work
not
having
started
except
that
the
gate
rail
has
been
swung
open
to
permit
the
wheels
to
be
taken
from
the
car.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
it's
a
similar
car
mr.
justice
black.
it's
the
same
type
of
car
that
was
involved
in
this
accident.
we
can
see
both
of
the
journal
boxes
in
the
petitioner's
exhibit
2.
we
can
see
both
of
the
helical
springs
which
are
on
the
truck
of
the
car.
we
can
see
the
truck
frame
and
the
pedestal
lining
which
lines
the
arch
into
which
the
journal
box
fits.
and
in
res
--
in
petitioner's
exhibit
2,
we
can
see
that
the
flanges
on
either
side
of
the
journal
box
on
the
outside
of
the
truck
are
sliding
along
the
pedestal
lining
and
are
in
a
position
where
the
entire
flange
is
alongside
of
the
pedestal
lining,
and
where
the
bottom
of
the
flange
is
considerably
above
the
bottom
of
the
pedestal
lining.
we
can
also
see
that
the
equalizer
bar
which
--
on
which
both
of
the
springs
rest
has
fit
into
a
groove
on
the
top
of
the
journal
box
itself.
respondent's
exhibit
a
printed
at
page
116
of
the
record
shows
the
type
of
hoist
involved
in
the
operation
but
before
being
raised
to
the
axle
of
the
wheels.
it
will
be
seen
in
this
photograph
that
the
wheels
over
the
hoist
are
still
on
the
rails.
this
photograph
shows
a
portion
of
the
piston.
and
this
piston
admittedly,
is
physically
and
permanently
attached
to
the
platform.
it
shows
the
crossbar
with
the
prongs
or
forks
at
either
end
which
fit
on
the
axles
of
the
wheels
with
the
highest
point
of
the
forks
farthest
away
from
the
center
of
the
hoist.
it
also
shows
the
nut
and
bolt
marked
with
an
“n”
by
which
the
horizontal
bar
is
attached
to
the
cylinder
portion
of
the
air
hoist.
the
respondent
concedes
that
with
the
platform
in
this
position,
it
can
move
laterally
from
side
to
side.
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner's
witness
was
that
with
the
pair
of
wheels
on
the
hoist
it
took
four
men
to
move
the
platform.
so
that
we
can
see
it's
not
something
which
readily
moves.
the
wheel,
the
set
of
wheels
weighs
approximately
3100
pounds
plus
the
weight
of
the
platform
and
the
hoist
itself,
the
testimony
was
that
it
took
four
men
to
move
it
one
way
or
the
other.
respondent
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
yes
sir.
it
can
move
the
--
pit
itself
was
twenty-three
feet
in
length.
the
platform,
i
believe
was
twelve
feet
in
length
so
that
it
was
approximately
eleven
feet
of
movable
distance,
which
is
required
in
order
to
take
the
platform
with
the
wheels
out,
put
a
crane
down
to
take
one
set
of
wheels
off,
replace
the
wheels
with
the
crane,
and
then
move
it
back
under
the
car
so
that
the
new
set
of
wheels
can
be
applied
to
the
car.
in
other
words
sir,
the
platform
itself
had
to
come
out
from
underneath
the
car
so
that
the
wheels
could
be
physical
removed
from
the
platform
and
a
new
set
applied.
respondent's
exhibit
b,
which
is
printed
at
the
117
of
the
record,
and
this
shows
a
truck
assembly
with
the
type
of
journal
box
involved
in
this
case.
the
journal
box
has
moved
up
into
the
pedestal
lining
and
the
position
that
was
in
shortly
before
the
petitioner
and
its
mechanic
put
the
coil
spring
in
the
cup.
this
photograph,
respondent's
exhibit
b,
clearly
shows
the
pedestal
linings
which
line
the
sides
of
the
arch
of
the
truck.
we
also
see
the
grove
at
the
top
of
the
journal
box
into
which
the
equalizer
bar
fits.
in
this
photograph,
the
journal
box
has
not
yet
moved
up
to
the
position
where
the
equalizer
bar
has
fitted
into
the
grove.
this
photograph
also
shows
the
flanges
of
the
journal
box
on
the
outside
of
the
journal
box.
there
are
similar
flanges
which
slide
along
the
pedestal
lining,
the
same
pedestal
lining
of
the
same
truck
on
the
other
side
of
the
same
journal
box,
that
is
on
the
side
of
the
journal
box
closest
to
the
wheel
itself.
this
also
shows
the
journal
box
fitted
into
the
arch
of
the
truck.
exhibit
b
of
course
shows
only
the
wheel
and
journal
box
on
one
side
of
the
car.
there
was
a
similar
journal
box
with
its
flanges
and
similar
pedestal
linings
on
the
other
side
of
the
car.
in
other
words
we
can
only
see
two
flanges
on
the
outside
of
the
car.
there
are
in
fact
four
flanges
for
each
journal
box
and
two
journal
box
for
each
set
of
wheels
so
that
in
fact
we
have
eight
flanges
that
are
involved
in
moving
this
one
set
of
wheels
up
into
the
pedestal
lining.
respondent's
exhibit
c
is
a
photograph
printed
at
one
--
page
118
of
the
record.
this
shows
the
same
equipment
with
the
journal
box
now
moved
up
further
into
the
pedestal
lining
and
with
the
equalizer
bar
now
in
the
grove
at
the
top
of
the
journal
box.
this
was
concededly
the
position
of
the
equipment
just
at
the
time
that
the
petitioner
and
his
mechanic
put
this
spring
seat
and
that's
the
spring
seat
which
is
shown
in
respondent's
exhibit
b
printed
at
page
119
of
the
record,
in
the
place
designed
for
it
on
the
equalizer
bar
and
then
inserted
the
coil
spring
into
its
position
between
the
equalizer
bar
and
the
underside
of
the
frame
of
the
truck.
it
will
be
noted
that
at
this
time
and
this
is
the
time
just
before
the
helical
spring
was
inserted
into
the
cup.
the
entire
length
of
the
flanges
have
moved
up
to
a
position
along
the
pedestal
linings
where
the
bottom
of
the
flanges
are
some
distance
from
the
bottom
of
the
pedestal
lining.
respondent's
exhibit
e
is
a
photograph
printed
at
page
120
of
the
record.
this
photograph
concededly
shows
a
man
holding
the
helical
coil
spring
in
approximately
the
same
position
as
the
petitioner
claims
to
have
been
holding
the
helical
spring
at
the
time
of
this
accident.
we
can
see
that
the
spring
seat
is
in
position
on
the
equalizer
bar
and
the
coil
spring
is
in
the
cup
on
the
underside
of
the
frame
and
in
the
cup
of
the
spring
seat.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
while
he
was
holding
the
helical
spring
in
the
position
shown
in
this
photograph,
respondent's
exhibit
e,
printed
at
page
120.
and
while
the
air
hoist
was
moving
the
set
of
wheels
further
up
into
the
truck,
he
saw
the
platform
move.
it
is
the
respondent's
position
and
has
always
been
the
respondent's
position
that
this
testimony
is
incredible.
this
was
at
2:15
in
the
morning.
the
testimony
was
that
there
were
lights
shining
down
on
the
men
working
in
this
pit
but
that
there
were
no
lights
at
the
bottom
of
the
pit.
you
will
note
in
the
photograph
that
in
holding
the
helical
spring,
the
man
is
directed
towards
the
car
and
i
say
and
it
has
been
our
position
throughout
that
to
say
that
this
man
saw
the
platform
beneath
him
move
is
incredible.
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
neither
the
petitioner
nor
his
mechanic
at
anytime
said,
“how
much
it
moved?
in
which
way
it
moved,
whether
it
moved
up,
down,
sideways
or
whether
it
merely
vibrated?”
all
they
testified
to
is
movement.
and
i
say
and
it
has
been
our
position
throughout
that
in
the
position
that
this
equipment
was
in,
the
platform
could
not
move.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
it
is,
mr.
justice
harlan.
yes
sir.
this
--
the
--
harper
was
in
a
position
and
the
record
is
not
exactly
clear
as
to
just
where
he
was.
he
was
at
some
place
in
the
pit
operating
the
apparatus
to
raise
the
piston
and
nearby
the
wheels
into
the
position
of
--
in
the
car
in
which
it
was
ultimately
going
to
go.
and
he
also
testified
that
he
saw
the
platform
moved
or
he
said
he
saw
the
table
move
a
little.
he
also
testified
that
he
didn't
know
which
way
it
moved
or
how
much
it
moved.
the
only
thing
we
have
is
that
there
was
movement.
whether
it
was
a
vibratory
motion,
whether
it
was
side
to
side
motion,
whether
it
was
an
up
and
down
motion,
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
my
theory
is
very
simple
one
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
that
is
this,
following
this
accident,
this
--
the
petitioner
was
interrogated
by
his
gang
foreman
as
to
what
happened.
and
you
will
note
that
in
defendant's
exhibit
e,
the
man
is
holding
the
helical
spring
with
two
hands.
what
i
believe
the
petitioner
was
doing
was
holding
the
helical
spring
with
his
right
hand
and
holding
his
left
hand
on
the
gate
rail
which
is
swung
open
and
which
is
shown
directly
below
the
man.
and
that
--
when
this
--
a
bar
moved
up,
holding
it
with
one
hand,
the
testimony
is
that
you
cannot
hold
it
properly
with
one
hand,
that
you
must
hold
it
with
two.
that
as
he
was
holding
it
with
one
hand,
as
it
went
up
to
go
into
the
seat
on
the
truck
of
the
frame,
it
kicked
out
and
that
he
was
not
able
to
hold
it
with
one
hand,
and
as
a
result
of
that
it
came
out
and
struck
him
on
the
finger,
on
the
hand
which
was
resting
on
the
gate
rail.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
my
theory
is
both
that
--
my
theory
is
that
there
was
no
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
railroad.
this
was
the
ordinary
way
in
which
this
was
done.
it
was
the
way
it
had
been
done
for
years.
that
is
holding
it
with
both
hands
and
that
the
man
himself
was
the
sole
cause
of
this
accident
by
failing
to
properly
hold
the
--
and
give
his
attention,
his
entire
attention
to
holding
this
helical
spring
as
this
was
being
moved
up
into
position.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
well,
may
i
say
this
mr.
justice
goldberg.
if
they
found
that
there
was
movement
and
if
they
found
that
there
was
reasonable
foreseeability
of
such
movement
as
would
cause
injury,
then
yes,
the
fact
that
he
was
holding
it
with
one
hand
would
only
go
to
the
question
of
damages
yes
sir.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
there
is
a
testimony
by
the
foreman
genova
(ph)
that
the
petitioner
told
him
that
he
was
holding
it
with
one
hand.
there
is
no
testimony,
direct
testimony.
the
petitioner
himself
testified
that
he
was
holding
it
with
both
hands.
but
the
--
immediately
after
this
accident
occurred,
genova
(ph)
who
has
the
gang
foreman
of
the
petitioner
interrogated
the
petitioner
as
to
how
the
accident
happened.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
well,
my
position
mr.
justice
black
is
two-fold.
first,
we
contend
that
there
was
no
movement.
now,
if
the
jury
found
movement,
this
we
believe
would
not
be
sufficient
to
establish
responsibility
on
the
respondent.
there
must
be
movement
and
according
to
the
recent
pronouncement
in
the
gallick
case,
which
reaffirmed
previous
opinions,
there
must
be
a
reasonable
foreseeability
of
harm.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
reasonable
foreseeability
of
harm?
oh,
very
definitely,
very
definitely.
that's
the
second
point
to
which
i'm
arguing
before
the
court.
and
i
will
--
i
think
i
will
be
able
to
demonstrate
that
even
assuming
that
there
was
movement,
which
i
don't
see
how
it
was
possible,
even
assuming
there
was,
there
was
certainly
no
reasonable
foreseeability
that
there
would
be
movement.
my
position
is
this
that
if
we
have
testimony
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
that
would
--
there
would
be
harm,
that
there
would
be
harm.
i
believe
that
there
must
be
two.
there
must
be
a
reasonable
foreseeability
of
movement
and
reasonable
foreseeability
of
such
movement
as
would
cause
harm.
there
are
many
times
in
the
operation
of
a
railroad
when
the
railroad
knows
that
there
would
be
movement
during
a
particular
operation.
for
example,
in
operating
a
train
when
the
train
operates
there
was
movement.
but
there
must
be
an
addition
to
that
reasonable
foreseeability
that
harm
will
result
from
such
movement.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
that
was
the
testimony
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
--
of
the
petitioners
witness
harper,
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
there
was
none,
sir.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
that
for
a
time
there
was,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
the
record
does
not
show
why
there
was
none
in
this
and
the
record
shows
that
from
the
--
from
mr.
brunner
who
was
the
expert
of
the
respondent
that
the
reason
that
that
was
put
in
there
was
so
that
the
platform
would
be
in
position
when
the
men
came
to
work.
now
it
may
have
been
and
the
record
is
completely
devoid
of
any
information
on
this.
i
can
merely
assume
that
there
was
some
particular
reason
for
putting
it
in
2,
and
not
for
putting
it
in
3
and
1
because
the
--
harper,
who
has
petitioned
as
mechanic,
testified
that
the
complaint
was
made
as
to
2.
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
complaint
was
made
as
to
3
nor
as
to
1,
which
were
the
other
two
wheel
pits.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
no,
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
well,
because
the
witness,
harper,
testified
that
he
called
the
attention
to
genova
(ph),
which
by
the
way
genova
(ph)
denies
but
that's
an
issue
of
fact.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
he
called
the
attention
to
genova
(ph)
that
the
--
they
required
something
in
number
2
wheel
pit
to
prevent
motion.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
however,
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
to
prevent
motion
at
the
time
that
this
operation
was
taking
effect
because
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
that
is
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
there
was
--
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
it
was
ever
requested
with
respect
to
this
particular
wheel
pit,
wheel
pit
number
3.
and
may
i
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
no
your
honor.
there
was
no
testimony
of
that
at
all.
the
only
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
the
testimony
was
that
he
was
working
in
wheel
pit
number
2.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
this
happened
in
wheel
pit
number
3.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
that
there
--
that
there
was
some
motion,
it's
not
--
there
is
no
indication
as
to
when
this
motion
took
place
and
as
a
result
of
his
complaint
which
was
denied
by
the
way,
as
i
said
by
the
foreman,
but
as
a
result
of
his
complaint,
they
put
a
hook-and-eye
in
wheel
pit
number
2.
the
testimony
further
established
that
when
they
renewed
the
table
in
this
same
pit,
pit
number
2,
they
did
not
replace
the
eye
on
the
--
on
the
table.
so
that
this
became
in
disused
and
the
evidence
firmly
established
that
when
these
pits
were
designed,
there
was
nothing
in
the
design
of
the
pits
that
--
for
any
hook-and-eye.
and
i
think
that
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice
point
out,
that
a
hook-and-eye
from
its
very
nature
would
permit
some
motion,
however
slight,
otherwise
you
would
never
be
able
to
get
a
hook
into
the
eye.
so
that
the
hook-and-eye
which
was
used
was
not
designed
to
act
in
such
a
way
that
there
could
be
no
motion
of
any
kind.
the
testimony
of
mr.
brunner
was
that
it
was
put
in
so
that
when
the
men
came
to
work,
the
pit
--
the
table
would
be
in
position
for
them
to
do
their
work.
now,
as
i
said
i
can
only
surmise
why
it
was
put
in
2
and
not
--
and
that
no
complaint
was
made
as
to
3
and
1.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
and
so
unless
your
honor
wants
me
to,
i
will
not
give
you
why
i
think
it
was
put
in
2,
and
not
in
3
and
1.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
essentially
the
same
but
i
think
i
can
give
an
explanation
but
it's
not
in
the
record,
as
to
why
--
why
they
would
put
it
in
2
and
not
in
1,
or
3.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
my
reason
for
thinking
that
they
put
it
in
2
and
not
on
3
and
1
is
that
in
2,
there
may
have
some
--
been
some
slight
decline
in
the
pit
itself
so
that
they
had
to
have
something
that
would
hold
this
imposition
before
they
got
it
raised
up
into
the
pedestal,
otherwise
it
could
slide
downhill.
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
this
was
so
in
3.
and
i'm
merely
saying
that
that's
--
is
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
there
was
none
sir.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
that
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
it
was
different
other
than
--
the
only
complaint
was
made
with
respect
to
2
and
there
was
no
complaint
made
with
respect
to
3.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
that
--
the
what,
sir?
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
a
hundred
and
nine
pounds.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
one
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
well,
the
two
men,
the
mechanic
and
the
petitioner
put
it
into
the
seat.
you
see
it
fits
into
a
seat
on
the
equalizer
bar.
once
it's
in
that
seat,
then
the
petitioner,
who
was
the
helper
holds
it
while
the
mechanic
goes
and
lifts
this
whole
apparatus
so
that
it
now
puts
tension
on
the
spring.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
only
one
was
working
--
only
one
was
working
on
the
spring
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
if
the
man
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
i
don't
know
sir.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
well,
the
petitioner
said
that
what
happened
is
that
the
platform
moved
and
he
had
to
let
go
of
the
coil
spring
and
that's
what
permitted
it
to
come
out.
the
testimony
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
if
your
honor
--
mr.
justice
black,
we'll
look
at
defendant's
exhibit
c.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
that's
on
page
118
of
the
record.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
you
will
see
that
the
wheel
as
it
comes
up
goes
against
a
brake
shoe
and
that
when
it
goes
against
the
brake
shoe
and
the
apparatus
there,
there
is
some
pressure
put
on
this
coil
spring
and
that
is
the
reason
why
the
men
has
to
hold
it
with
both
hands
so
that
it
stays
in
place.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
the
whole
apparatus
of
this
110
pounds
of
pressure
being
applied
upward
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
the
wheel
moving
up
onto
the
brake
shoe.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
well
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
well,
if
--
if
it
please
the
--
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that
it
was
--
it
would
not
be
foreseeable
if
the
--
if
the
--
that
this
might
slip
out.
but
that
was
not
an
issue
that
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
the
only
issue
that
was
submitted
to
the
jury
is
was
their
negligence
in
not
--
in
permitting
this
platform
to
move.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
well,
it's
not
a
question
of
the
--
of
the
spring
moving
that
the
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
the
spring
actually
did
move.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
but
that's
--
that's
not
the
negligence
that
the
jury
was
charged
with
respect
to,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
no.
the
only
negligence
that
the
jury
was
permitted
to
find
in
this
case
was
whether
it
was
--
was
the
railroad
negligent
in
failing
to
have
some
sort
of
a
--
a
brake
or
a
hook-and-eye
to
prevent
movement
of
the
platform
itself.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
well
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
that
is
correct.
now,
i'm
not
quite
sure
mr.
justice
black
when
you
say
the
thing
moved.
are
you
speaking
of
the
helical
spring
moving
or
the
platform
moving?
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
the
helical
spring
hit
him,
but
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
but
that's
not
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
quite
understand
the
--
if
you're
speaking
of
the
helical
spring
moving,
this
is
not
the
foreseeability
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
--
i
was
speaking
of
the
platform.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
there
was
no
doubt
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
--
that
the
helical
spring
came
out.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
no.
they
could
not
reasonably
foresee
it
mr.
justice
black
and
may
i
just
point
out
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
--
why?
if
your
honor
will
look
at
this
apparatus
that's
being
moved
up
into
this
truck
and
frame,
that
the
movement
which
can
occur
is
at
most
at
anytime
a
quarter
of
an
inch
and
that
is
only
if
four
men
or
a
comparable
force
got
on
the
side
of
this
and
pushed
it
laterally
(inaudible).
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
well,
i
understand
mr.
justice
black.
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
the
type
of
movement
which
at
any
time
could
possibly
occur,
it's
the
same
as
if
i
say,
i
stood
against
that
pillar
and
pushed
my
head
against
it
and
i
moved
it
two
inches.
certainly,
the
court
would
not
accept
my
testimony
to
that
effect
even
though
it
is
some
evidence.
and
we
must
see
what
type
of
movement
could
possibly
occur
as
to
see
whether
or
not
this
type
of
harm
or
any
harm
was
foreseeable.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
the
left
hand.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
he
told
that
the
foreman
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
i
would
say
mr.
chief
justice
that
it's
a
matter
of
common
sense
he
would
not.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
and
that
was
--
that
is
why
the
accident
happened
--
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
--
because
he
didn't
used
common
sense.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
well,
may
i
answer
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
j.
mountan,
jr.
the
jury
didn't
know
whether
or
not
the
platform
moved.
