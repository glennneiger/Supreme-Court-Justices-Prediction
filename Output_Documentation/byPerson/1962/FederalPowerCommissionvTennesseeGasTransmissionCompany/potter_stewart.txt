justice
potter
stewart
mr.
spritzer,
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
you
lost
me
somewhere
in
your
development
of
facts,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
with
chief
judge
tatel
dissenting,
held
that
whether
that
the
6
1/8%
rate
of
return
was
correct.
but
that
the
commission
didn't
have
the
power
to
put
that
portion
of
its
determination
into
effect
immediately
as
it
did.
and
now,
have
you
told
us
that
despite
that
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
is
what
happened?
justice
potter
stewart
for
that
reason,
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
that
appeal
that
you
left?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
this
i
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
on
june
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
the
government's
chronological
statement?
i
don't
know
if
you
have
it.
justice
potter
stewart
this,
--
on
june
4th
of
this
year
that
petition
for
review
was
filed
in
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
the
only
thing
wrong
is
c.a.
3
here?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
the
--
and
that's
columbia's
petition
to
review
the
allocation
decision
of
the
commission?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
is
this
what
the
commission
came
up
with?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
did
--
you
did
is
that
you
protected
that
method
into
dollar
and
this
what
come
up?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
the
method,
which
is
now
being
reviewed
at
columbia
in
instance
in
the
court
of
appeals
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
i
understand
mr.
rhyne
to
say
that
you
were
just
a
conduit
or
a
stakeholder,
or
did
he
say
that?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
companies
or
distributing
companies?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you're
regulated
i
suppose
by
now
only
by
state
but
by
cities
in
some
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
when
your
cost
go
up
you
can't
always
really
pass
them
along,
can
you?
