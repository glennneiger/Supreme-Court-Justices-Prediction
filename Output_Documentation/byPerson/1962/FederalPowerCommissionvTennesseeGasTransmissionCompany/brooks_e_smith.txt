mr.
brooks
e.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
associate
justices.
at
the
outset,
i
think
i
should
identify
to
the
court
the
position
of
the
columbia
gas
system
company
in
this
proceeding.
as
mr.
spritzer
argued,
i
don't
believe
mr.
spritzer
mentioned
the
columbia
gas
system
company
although
if
you
read
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
below
why
the
columbia
position
and
the
arguments
of
columbia
featured
--
quite
well
featured
in
the
decision
of
both
of
mr.
justice
--
judge
wisdom
and
the
dissenting
judge
the
chief
judge
tatel.
when
mr.
rhyne,
representing
the
city
of
pittsburgh
got
up,
he
confined
his
mention
of
the
columbia
companies
as
impugning
their
motives
for
being
here
at
all.
even
though
if
the
columbia
companies,
who
have
taken
the
burden
in
this
cost
allocation
fight
for
many,
many
years
wins,
it
will
mean
that
the
people
of
pittsburgh
and
the
people
of
pennsylvania
will
be
--
will
receive
more
refunds
than
they
will
under
any
other
of
the
cost
allocation
methods
presented
in
the
--
before
the
commission.
and
it
would
be
presented
if
the
columbia
companies
prevail
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
then
go
back
to
the
commission
and
get
their
reliefs
of
the
true
and
correct
method
of
cost
allocation
applied
to
the
rates.
now,
--
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
the
--
in
all
of
the
columbia
company
cases
that
we
have
before
the
state
commission
to
see
we
are
regulated
by
our
seven
state
commissions
as
well
as
the
federal
power
commission.
the
state
commissions
have
--
will
take
jurisdiction
and
see
to
it
that
the
refunds
are
passed
through
to
the
consumer
and
the
--
if
in
cases
there
might
be
several
consumers
who
have
left
one
jurisdiction
going
to
another.
i
believe
the
ordinary
rule
is
that
there
will
be
a
credit
made
to
that
residence
for
the
next
occupant
of
that
particular
house.
but
it's
not
perfect
but
the
chances
of
any
great
number
of
consumers
being
prejudiced
because
of
our
present
mobile
society
is
not
substantial.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
well,
because
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
that
anyone
has
ever
ran
a
statistic
on
how
many
people
do
move
from
their
homes.
i
just
believe
that
the
number
would
be
few
proportionately,
that
the
great
majority,
these
consumers
lived
in
their
homes
for
many
years
and
if
the
--
i'm
sure
the
commissions
will
pass
through
the
refunds
to
those
consumers
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
well,
if
they
happen
to
occupy
--
they
happen
to
occupy
the
residence
that
was
occupied
by
a
consumer
who
was
overcharged
why
they
will
get
credit
and
they
pass
through.
however,
the
--
when
you
get
these
refunds
back
to
the
individual
consumer,
the
amount
of
money
to
each
consumer
is
very,
very
small.
i
think,
in
this
case,
they
gave
a
figure
of
15
cents
per
month.
it's
--
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
oh
no,
the
--
whatever
is
due,
the
state
commissions
takes
charge
and
in
our
case
is
particularly
they
see
to
it
that
some
adjustment
is
made.
they
all
have
different
ways
to
adjust
them
by
escalation
clauses
up
and
down
and
by
crediting
the
bills
of
the
future
to
make
up
for
the
overcharges
in
the
past.
they
have
all
different
types
of
methods
but
the
court
--
if
the
court
pleases,
the
state
commissions
do
take
charge
of
their
responsibility.
i
don't
say
that
it's
absolutely
perfect,
but
they
do
a
very
good
job.
now,
columbia's
interest
in
this
proceeding
are
not
identical
with
tennessee
although
we
are
both
correspondents,
we
do
not
have
the
same
interest
except
that
we
do
both
believe
that
the
fifth
circuit's
order
should
be
sustained.
the
court
might
wonder
why
and
what
benefit
it
would
be
to
the
columbia
companies
to
have
the
fifth
circuit's
order
sustained,
and
there's
a
twofold
way
that
that
is
an
economic
benefit
to
the
columbia
companies.
that
is,
they
will
be
sure
that
for
the
past
periods
that
they
will
not
be
made
to
subsidize
other
consumers,
other
zones,
if
the
columbia
companies
after
having
their
day
in
court
and
having
the
commission
decide
these
matters.
and
the
court
review
them
and
find
them
--
the
commission's
method
improper
and
then
the
--
our
position
prevail
that
we
will
not
be
made
to
make
up
to
tennessee
the
6
1/8%
return
that
the
commission
said
that
they
should
have.
as
far
as
the
second
point
for
the
future,
if
the
columbia
companies'
method
of
cost
allocation
prevails,
finally
that
would
mean
that
the
consumers
that
are
served
by
the
columbia
companies
will
only
pay
their
just
due
and
will
not
be
paying
in
the
future
the
cost
should've
been
paid
to
tennessee
in
the
rates
charged
to
other
zones.
now,
mr.
--
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
he
did
say
that
and
that
i
think
ties
it
up
with
mr.
chief
justice's
viewpoint
to
put
who
gets
the
refund.
we
are
a
stakeholder
and
we
do
pass
it
through,
but
if
your
honor
please,
it's
to
the
best
business
interest
of
the
columbia
companies.
moreover,
the
columbia
companies
have
a
duty
to
the
public
to
see
to
it
that
the
rates
are
as
low
as
they
possibly
can
be.
they
have
a
competitive
position.
mr.
rhyne
said
that
there
is
a
competitive
fuel
problem.
it's
to
our
business
interest
and
it's
in
our
duty
to
the
public
to
keep
those
rates
as
low
as
possible.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
there's
more
to
it
than
just
being
a
conduit
for
refund.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
both,
they
distribute
and
they
sell
at
wholesale.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
that's
correct,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
that's
right.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
that's
what
i
was
going
to
next
develop
mr.
justice.
in
1955,
the
commission
formally
recognized
that
this
issue
existed
in
the
last
brief
case
that
was
settled
and
finally
determined.
that
was
the
so-called
docket
g-5259.
the
issue
was
raised
in
that
proceeding
but
the
commission
transferred
that
issue
over
to
a
specific
docket,
docket
number
g-11980
and
it
was
in
1955
that
the
commission
itself
formally
recognized
that
the
issue
prevail
--
existed.
and
there
was
in
that
same
case
that
tennessee
tried
to
get
made
a
motion
for
interim
rates
and
the
commission
denied
that
motion
because
it
said
it
was
improper
and
that
matter
was
presented
to
the
court
below
and
commented
upon
in
the
decision
below.
in
1957,
the
commission
acted
to
put
this
cost
allocation
in
this
docket
number
g-11980
and
it
was
to
permeate,
it
was
to
run
through
all
of
the
other
rate
cases
that
followed
that
were
then
existing
and
have
since
been
filed,
there
are
three
of
them.
now,
as
i
say,
columbia
is
not
merely
being
litigious
and
it's
not
a
mere
question
of
a
fight
on
different
mathematical
methods
of
cost
allocation.
there's
more
to
it
than
that.
a
little
bit
of
history
has
to
be
presented
to
the
court
to
see
why
columbia
companies
feel
so
strongly
about
this.
at
the
outset
of
tennessee's
corporate
existence,
they
sold
most
of
their
gas
in
west
virginia
which
was
then
carried
on
into
ohio
and
kentucky
and
pennsylvania.
and
about
1950,
the
complexion
started
to
change.
tennessee
begun
to
expand
to
new
market.
they
went
up
to
new
york
and
new
england
also
up
into
canada
and
during
that
period
of
1950
through
1958
when
this
expansion
was
going
on
to
other
markets,
they
did
not
expand
a
very
greatly
if
at
all
to
sell
more
gas
to
columbia.
but
even
though
the
expansion
and
the
cost
multiplied
during
that
period,
tennessee
filed
a
series
of
rates
ever
since
1947.
and
those
rates
fell
disproportionately
upon
columbia.
now,
there's
another
factor
in
this
history
and
that
is
apparently
the
new
--
the
expansion
in
the
new
england
didn't
pay
out
the
way
they
thought
it
would
during
this
buildup
or
development
period.
and
so
we
have
the
case
where
tennessee
was
not
making
such
a
good
sales
picture
in
the
northeast
and
so
to
make
their
overall
return,
we
felt
that
the
facts
show,
that
the
rates
seems
to
be
falling
disproportionately
on
us.
that's
what
gave
us
the
impetuous
to
get
in
and
try
to
see
what
was
causing
this
and
we
fear
that
we
were
being
made
to
subsidize
the
expansion
into
other
markets.
we
didn't
feel
that
should
be
done.
it's
not
that
we
don't
want
new
england
to
have
as
low
of
rate
as
they
possibly
can
but
we
think
that
if
the
expansion
was
improvident
that
it
should
be
tennessee
that
would
have
to
absorb
the
difference
and
not
columbia
companies
and
the
other
companies
that
serve
in
middle
of
appalachian
area.
now,
--
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
that's
true
and
that's
why
it
puzzles
me
to
see
the
city
of
pittsburgh
taking
an
opposite
view.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
pardon
me?
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
well,
it's
not
in
this
proceeding.
they
should
be
on
our
side
because
we
have
taken
the
burden
of
going
forward
and
trying
to
get
a
fair
complete
determination
of
the
cost
allocation
issue.
now,
most
of
my
time
was
taken
up,
so
i
have
to
hurry
along
but
--
and
hit
some
legal
points
that
were
covered
by
mr.
spritzer.
mr.
spritzer
seemed
to
argue
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
solely
upon
the
natural
gas
company
that
was
filing
the
higher
rate,
tennessee.
well,
now
section
4
(e)
does
state
that
but
this
is
a
little
different.
it's
not
that
the
burden
of
proof
doesn't
lie
with
tennessee
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
sole
right
to
present
evidence
is
tennessee.
it's
not
that
the
tennessee
method
of
cost
allocation
raised
this
issue
for
the
first
time.
the
commission
took
the
issue,
recognized
the
issue
and
put
it
in
this
docket
number
g-11980,
and
raised
that
issue
knowing
that
the
columbia
companies
have
been
complaining
for
years
that
they
were
being
made
to
subsidize
the
undercharged
zone
of
tennessee.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
question
of
whether
new
england
is
undercharged
or
not
must
depend
upon
how
the
cost
are
allocated
to
the
zones.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
on
the
allocation.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
that's
right.
we
are
for
the
reduction
in
rates
in
our
area
zones
2,
3
and
4
but
we
want
the
customers
in
zones
5
and
6
to
pay
their
fair
share
because
otherwise
if
they
don't
pay
their
fair
share
it's
either
tennessee
or
some
other
customers
in
other
zones
that
pay.
the
difference
is
they
--
when
you
--
the
commission
decides
the
cost,
there's
a
certain
--
there
might
be
a
certain
reduction
in
total
overall
cost.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
those
costs
should
be
distributed
proportionately.
some
zones
might
not
be
entitled
to
recover
any.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
we
--
the
order
the
reduced
the
rate
only
covered
two
items,
the
rate
of
return
which
we
took
no
part,
we
did
not
object
to
the
commission's
determination
that
6
1/8%
return
was
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
of
return.
so
we
did
not
oppose
the
commission's
order
in
that
respect.
we
did
oppose
the
only
other
item
in
the
commission's
order
in
which
they
said
now,
take
this
reduced
cost
of
service
and
use
the
contested
method
of
cost
allocation
that
tennessee
used
and
was
still
being
tried
in
another
administrative
proceeding
and
now
you
reduce
your
rates
accordingly.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
that
--
that
we're
litigating.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
that's
right
but
it
permeates
the
underlying
case
whatever
happens
in
that
cost
allocation
case
it's
still
not
final
must
be
applied
to
the
underlying
case.
and
that's
where
the
rub
comes.
someone
is
going
to
get
hurt.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
well,
i
do
know
that,
for
example,
in
pennsylvania,
the
refunds
that
were
made
to
columbia
from
tennessee
in
the
past
are
now
being
given
credit
on
the
future
bills
to
the
retail
customers
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
they
do
business
in
the
states
of
pennsylvania
and
west
virginia.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
ohio
fuel.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
no,
they
are
subsidiaries
of
the
columbia
gas
system
in
columbia.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
no,
just
the
columbia
companies
comprise
the
seven
state,
mid-atlantic
area,
kentucky,
west
virginia,
virginia,
ohio,
pennsylvania,
parts
of
new
york
and
parts
of
the
district
of
columbia
by
whole
through
wholesale.
they
sell
for
wholesale
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
quite
a
different
company.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
well,
mr.
justice
white
whether
tennessee
has
the
money
or
not
is
something
i
can't
answer.
but
i
do
know
that
if
we
--
if
the
columbia
companies
prevail
on
our
appeal
in
the
cost
allocation
fight
that
are
still
before
the
lower
court
then
the
cost
will
be
remanded
to
the
commission.
now,
at
that
point,
the
commission
will
face
with
this
problem.
it
will
have
told
tennessee
that
if
it
is
entitled
to
6
1/8%
return,
now
it
will
for
the
future.
i'm
not
going
to
get
into
the
difficulties
for
the
past
which
we've
discussed
on
a
refund
but
for
the
future,
it
seems
to
me
that
then
when
the
commission
determines
the
allowable
cost
of
service,
the
aggregate.
and
having
told
tennessee
that
it's
going
to
permit
them
to
earn
6
1/8%
return,
they're
going
to
do
everything
they
can
on
remand
to
work
up
a
cost
allocation
that
would
permit
tennessee
to
get
the
6
1/8%
and
take
it
out
our
eyes.
that's
just
the
point.
i
see
my
time
is
--
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
the
law
theoretically
prohibits
them
from
doing
that
but
the
section
4
(b),
the
section
that
specifically
prohibits
the
natural
gas
company
from
giving
an
undue
rate
preference
to
other
customers,
in
other
zones,
specifically,
that's
not
self
executing.
the
customer
companies
of
natural
gas
company
have
to
get
in
there
and
fight.
they
have
to
recognize
the
issue
and
do
all
they
can
to
have
their
position
prevail
before
the
commission
the
lower
tribunal.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
well,
the
commission
--
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
well,
--
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
yes,
that's
true,
your
honor.
but
i'm
afraid
the
commission
has
compromised
itself
by
first
deciding
the
--
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
the
commission
will
have
compromised
itself
because
it
will
have
determined
finally
that
6
1/8%
should
be
allowed
in
tennessee
and
there
it
will
be
searching
ways.
in
other
words,
we
won't
come
before
that
tribunal
in
a
mutual
position
along
with
all
the
other
parties.
we
will
have
to
be
fighting
against
this
issue
that
was
decided
out
of
line.
the
whole
point
of
the
error
i
think
of
the
commission
is
that
it
short
circuited
the
whole
administrative
process
and
damaged
us
in
the
process.
thank
you.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
no.
it
is
not,
if
your
honor
please.
if
the
cost
allocation
--
mr.
brooks

no.
i
want
to
explain
that
there
is
another
way
that
they
could've
acted.
they
could've
granted
an
interim
rate
reduction
order
in
this
very
case
if
they
would've
taken
the
columbia
method
of
cost
allocation.
and
the
cost
allocation
method,
that
is
the
other
extreme
applied
it
to
the
reduced
cost
of
service
and
then
they
would've
got
a
bracket,
a
maximum
and
a
minimum
for
each
zone.
and
then
they
could
have
ordered
reduced
rates
within
that
bracket.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
no,
this
was
not
proposed.
but
--
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
this
is
perfectly
valid
because
just
september
14
to
this
year,
the
columbia
companies
entered
into
a
settlement,
which
did
just
that.
the
columbia
had
a
cost
allocation
fight
on
its
hand
with
its
customers,
different
entirely
than
this.
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
there
are
many
ways
that
they
can
do
that.
the
principle,
the
cardinal
principle
mr.
justice
white
is
that
they
don't
act
so
as
to
prejudice
litigants.
there's
always
in
the
position
of
the
litigants.
there's
a
--
mr.
brooks
e.
smith
yes,
in
tennessee.
thank
you.
