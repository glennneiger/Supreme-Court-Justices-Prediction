mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
may
it
please
the
court.
the
city
of
pittsburgh
is
appearing
here
as
a
gas
consumer
as
a
representative
of
its
600,000
for
instance
most
consumer
--
gas
consumers,
to
speak
in
support
of
the
use
of
the
interim
order
procedure
in
this
case.
because
we
feel
that
it
is
vital
to
the
interest
of
consumers,
it's
vital
to
prevent
a
frustration
of
the
major
purpose,
the
natural
gas
act
which
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again,
is
to
prevent
natural
gas
companies
from
exploiting
consumers.
in
the
light
of
one
or
two
of
the
questions,
which
have
a
little
broader
thrust
within
this
case,
may
i
say
to
you
mr.
chief
justice
that
in
august
1962
according
to
the
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
commonwealth
pennsylvania,
there
were
$900
million
that
had
been
paid
subject
to
refund
in
this
pipeline
cases.
according
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
filed
here
for
the
solicitor
general,
the
amount
of
this
money
is
piling
up
at
the
--
at
$375
million
a
year.
also
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
all
pipelines.
and
on
--
this
is
on
page
19
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
right
there,
they
referred
to
what
happened
in
1961.
they
pointed
out
that
they
settled
31
and
i
used
the
word
“decided”
or
settled,
or
concluded
31
pipeline
cases.
and
that
in
doing
so,
they
reduced
the
amount
requested
by
37%
and
that
in
reducing
it
back
37%,
56%
of
this
amount
of
reduction
was
in
the
rate
of
return,
the
very
thing
that
it
is
here.
now,
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
according
to
the
commission's
1961
report,
30
and
i
emphasize,
30
of
these
31
were
settled
only
one
was
actually
decided.
now,
why
is
that
in
court
in
here?
because
under
the
--
in
the
context
of
this
case,
tennessee
asked
for
$75
million,
$11
million
was
disallowed
in
the
rate
of
return.
the
examiner
has
allowed
an
additional
--
or
disallowed
an
additional
$26
million.
$37
million
or
50%
has
been
disallowed.
so,
the
situation
that
exist
down
at
the
federal
power
commission,
the
reason
why
the
commission
has
moved
into
use
this
interim
power
at
long
last
is,
this
is
a
rather
shocking
way
to
evade
rate
regulation
under
the
natural
gas
act.
these
pipeline
companies
filed
one
rate
increase
--
this
is
tennessee
did
here,
one
on
--
right
on
top
of
another
and
so
this
backlog,
this
regulatory
log
grows
larger
and
larger
and
there's
tremendous
pressure
to
settle
--
to
settle
and
when
you
settle,
it's
the
consumer
that
loses.
these
pipeline
companies
are
very
glad
to
come
in
and
say,
well,
we'll
take
10%
or
25%
off
and
of
course
that
always
means
millions
of
dollars.
and
so
then
they
push
those
of
us
who
represent
consumer.
well,
let's
settle.
let's
settle.
there's
tremendous
pressure
on
the
commission
staff
to
settle
and
they
always
get
more.
so
this
allowance
of
37%
in
1961
is
a
great
boom
for
the
pipeline
companies.
this
business
is
conference
procedure,
the
settlement
procedure
i
know
that
the
commission
is
doing
a
terrific
job.
i'm
not
criticizing
at
all
but
i
am
saying
that
right
here
the
commission
has
put
its
finger
on
one
of
the
greatest
escape
route
and
that
you
have
no
effective
regulation
of
natural
gas
company
today
under
the
natural
gas
act
because
of
this
very
thing,
this
pyramiding
of
one
rate
increase
right
on
top
of
another.
and
i
think
that
the
court
should
take
all
of
those
facts
into
consideration
in
deciding
this
case.
not
only
do
i
agree
with
what
mr.
spritzer
had
said
but
i
think
that
this
pressurized
settlement
of
cases
before
the
federal
power
commission
is
one
of
the
most
vital
things
that
this
court
must
consider
in
facing
up
to
what
the
commission
is
trying
to
do
about
this
pated.
and
i
say,
it's
closer
to
50%
than
37%
rate
increase.
then
the
commission
can't
stop
these
pipelines
from
doing
it.
they
have
an
absolute
power
to
file
one
year
after
year
almost
day
after
day.
so,
we
urge
that
this
interim
power
which
the
commission
has
at
long
last
started
to
use
is
absolutely
vital
to
prevent
the
frustration
or
the
major
purpose
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
to
stop
this
greedy
train
escape
route,
this
windfall
to
the
pipeline
companies.
now,
i
was
to
discuss
whether
refunds
were
an
adequate
remedy
for
consumers
and
we
say
they're
not
for
several
reasons.
number
one,
under
today's
mobile
society,
people
move
around
all
the
time.
and
when
one
of
these
rate
cases
has
completed
four
or
five,
six,
seven
years
after
it
started,
you'd
have
a
hard
time
finding
the
ultimate
consumer
who
paid
the
illegal
rates
and
get
the
money
back
in
his
pocket
because
it
comes
out
of
the
ultimate
consumer's
pocket
not
out
of
the
pipeline
or
other
distribution
company's
pocket.
secondly,
in
connection
with
the
rate
increase
and
this
is
particularly
important
for
small
business,
as
well
as
large
business,
when
a
rate
increase
goes
into
effect,
they
must
increase
the
price
of
their
product
immediately
in
order
to
recover
what
they
paid
out
of
their
pocket
right
then.
and
that
puts
him
in
a
terrible
competitive
position
with
respect
to
those
who
use
other
kinds
of
fuel.
now,
they
can't
change
over
to
some
other
kind
of
view
because
the
cost
of
putting
in
new
burning
equipment
is
too
great.
so,
when
they
come
along
to
the
end
of
this
thing
five,
six,
seven,
eight
years
afterwards
and
there's
a
refund,
it
doesn't
pay
him
for
these
business
losses.
there
is
an
immediate
effect
on
the
consumer
and
they
get
back
the
rate
increase
is
plus
7%
interest
after
deduction
of
a
lot
of
expenses.
so
they
never
get
all
of
their
money
back.
and
now,
with
respect
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
justice
harlan,
there's
probably
more
confusion
on
that
and
almost
in
any
other
question
that
exists
in
this
whole
field,
the
distribution
companies
claimed
it
and
it's
suppose
to
be
decided
under
state
law
as
to
who
gets
it.
and
in
ultimate
thrust,
i
guess
if
you
can't
find
him
--
the
money
really
should
escape
to
the
state
eventually
but
i
don't
think
that
you
follow
down
that
long
road.
i
might
say
that
one
of
the
complexities
which
demonstrates
the
inadequacy
of
the
refund
thing
are
the
decisions
of
this
very
court
in
the
muscatine
case
and
then
in
the
natural
gas
case
where
you
handed
down
four
opinions
in
trying
to
decide
how
you
get
the
money
back
to
consumers.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
can't
enumerate,
mr.
justice
black.
i'd
like
to
ask
federal
power
commissions
do
it
rather
than
us
because
we
have
a
very
few
lawyers
in
my
office
and
this
is
a
tremendous
job.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
and
i
think
that
it's
an
answer
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
would
like
to
see
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
the
state
commissions
have
stepped
in
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
and
i
think
that
it's
an
open
question
as
far
as
i
know
mr.
justice
black
but
i
will
never
get
the
answer.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
not
that
i
know.
now,
i
must
hurry
along
because
i
have
very
little
time.
i'd
like
to
say
to
the
court
too
that
the
congress
recognized
that
refunds
are
not
an
adequate
remedy
for
the
consumer
because
they
provided
for
suspension
of
rates
of
five
months
suspension.
and
i
don't
know
whether
they
thought
that
the
commission
could
decide
this
case
within
five
months
but
if
they
had
thought
that
refunds
were
adequate,
they
wouldn't
provide
a
suspension.
they
would
let
the
rates
go
into
effect
immediately.
so,
we
say
most
respectfully
that
if
the
court
was
wrong
below
in
saying
that
refunds
are
an
adequate
remedy
for
the
consumer
in
concerning
itself
only
with
trying
to
protect
the
pipelines.
now,
the
second
point
that
i
was
to
discuss
relates
to
columbia
pipeline's
position
here.
it's
very
difficult
for
me
to
understand
their
position
because
they
are
pipeline
customer,
they
are
stakeholder,
they're
not
a
consumer.
they
agreed
that
these
--
well
in
the
first
place,
they
passed
on
each
of
these
three
rate
increases
directly
to
their
consumers.
they
agreed
in
the
settlement
of
ten
of
their
cases
last
year
that
any
money
received
from
this
would
go
right
along
to
the
consumers.
they
say
in
their
briefs
something
about
them
being
representative
consumers
and
i
say
to
you
that's
about
like
calling
yogi
bear
if
i
may
say
so
up
to
that
for
the
giants.
he
wouldn't
try
very
hard
and
i
can't
imagine
this
pipeline
company
which
is
one
of
the
tremendous
giants
of
the
industry
with
42,000
miles
of
pipeline,
it's
a
billion
dollar
corporation,
more
of
billion
and
a
half
corporation
coming
in
here
and
speaking
for
the
consumers.
they
seem
to
be
trying
to
say
that
somebody
up
in
boston
out
to
pay
this
illegal
7%
rate
so
that
they
can
get
their
hands
on
it
on
a
refund.
they're
trying
to
say
that
tennessee
can't
pay
back
to
them
of
what
money
they
pay
in
illegally
but
it's
not
their
money
in
the
first
place.
and
in
the
second
place,
tennessee
has
entered
into
an
obligation,
it's
on
page
508
of
the
record,
to
pay
ack
all
of
these
illegal
amounts
and
tennessee
is
a
giant
too,
they
have
billion
and
a
half
dollar
corporation.
they
are
present
in
this
record
over
on
pages
419
and
the
following
talks
about
how
rich
and
prosperous
they
are.
they
have
plenty
of
money
to
pay
it
back.
so,
columbia
can't
possibly
be
hurt
anyway
that
you
approach
this.
now,
they
say
maybe
this,
maybe
this,
maybe
columbia
will
have
some
money
coming
back,
maybe
tennessee
will
have
some
money
coming
back.
but
with
this
$26
billion
bulge
or
padding
or
pad,
as
chief
justice
tatel
call
it,
i
can't
see
any
question
but
what
columbia
or
anybody
else
who
might
have
any
money
coming
back
is
going
to
get
that
money.
and
they
assumed
that
the
commission
is
guarantying
tennessee
of
6
1/8%
return,
they're
not
doing
that.
they
haven't
guaranteed
anybody
that
but
i
say
it's
rather
shocking
that
they
having
conceded
that
the
6
1/8%
is
just
unreasonable
to
come
here
to
this
court
and
ask
this
court
to
reinstate
the
7%
rate
pendente
lite
so
to
speak.
and
just
because
they
say
that
tennessee
have
may
have
made
a
mistake
in
their
rate
design.
well,
now
consumers
are
not
guarantors
either
and
they
can't
shift
the
risk
of
the
natural
gas
business
from
consumer
--
from
the
stockholders
to
consumers.
the
act
doesn't
contemplate
that
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination.
and
so
they're
here,
i
think
throwing
up
some
kind
of
a
smoke
screen,
some
kind
of
a
shadow
box
to
try
to
confuse
the
issues
with
respect
to
this
interim
order
procedure.
and
my
time
is
done,
so
i
would
simply
say
this.
we
strenuously
urge
that
the
lower
court
decision
be
reversed
because
we
feel
that
what
is
occurring
and
what
has
occurred
in
this
case
before
the
federal
power
commission,
is
a
shocking
abuse
of
the
power
of
these
pipeline
companies
to
file
increased
rates
and
that
the
consumers
must
have
this
protection.
there
must
be
some
way
to
break
down
this
escape
hatch
and
stop
the
gal
--
this
exploitation
of
consumers,
which
is
going
on
under
the
present
circumstances
down
to
the
federal
power
commission.
