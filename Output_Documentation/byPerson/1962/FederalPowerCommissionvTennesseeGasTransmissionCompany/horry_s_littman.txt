mr.
horry
s.
littman
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
mr.
spritzer
is
to
be
remanded
for
his
excellent
clear
statement
of
the
facts
of
this
case.however,
before
proceeding
with
my
--
with
the
main
body
of
my
argument,
i
should
like
to
straighten
out
just
three
or
four
items
of
fact.
mr.
spritzer
said
early
in
his
argument
or
stated
the
question
early
in
his
argument
as
being
whether
the
commission
as
my
notes
show,
whether
the
commission
can
decide
a
rate
case
and
reduce
rates
at
an
interim
stage
without
waiting
until
the
entire
case
is
completed
in
all
of
its
aspect.
now,
we
do
not
agree
that
that
is
the
question
that
is
presented
here.
the
reason
we
do
not
agree
with
that
is
born
out
by
the
record.
we
certainly
do
not
and
never
have
taken
the
position
that
the
federal
power
commission
lacks
authority
generally
to
issue
interim
rate
orders.
indeed,
in
this
very
case
as
the
record
shows
in
our
memorandum,
in
opposition
to
the
interim
order
procedure,
at
page
592
and
that's
the
bottom
--
the
number
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
we
advise
the
commission
that
we
wanted
to
make
it
crystal
clear
that
we
did
not
oppose
the
interim
order
in
this
case.
if
the
commission
would
confine
its
decision
to
the
--
as
it
one
or
two
to
the
issue
of
rate
of
return,
provided
it
would
at
the
same
time
hand
down
its
decision
on
the
hotly
contested
allocation
issue
which
it
had
fully
heard
and
which
had
been
fully
briefed
and
which
was
awaiting
decision
at
that
time.
in
other
words,
we
told
the
commission,
we
thought
the
commission
should
be
equally
as
diligent
in
expediting
the
decision
in
this
case
on
the
very
important
allocation
issue
as
well
as
on
the
rate
of
return
issue.
in
fact,
we
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
that
is
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
that
is
--
well,
what
we
say
is
that
where
there
is
a
contested
allocation
issue
where
that
issue
is
in
contest
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
--
it
must
be
decided
for
the
reasons,
which
i
will
go
into
detail
in
my
argument,
before
the
commission
can
reduce
rates
for
the
reasons
i
will
state.
now,
the
natural
gas
act,
it's
impossible
to
order
a
reduction
in
rates
until
the
allocation
issue
where
it's
contested
is
decided.
now,
there
are
many
cases,
if
your
honor
please,
there
are
many
cases
where
interim
orders
can
be
issued.
for
instance,
the
case
that
counsel
cited,
the
natural
gas
pipeline
company
of
america
case,
which
this
court
would
reach
this
court.
in
that
case,
an
interim
order,
which
was
entered
into,
was
a
section
5
(a)
proceeding
where
the
commission
was
fixing
rates
prospectively.
now,
in
a
situation
like
that
and
where
the
company
cannot
be
heard
by
a
retroactive
rate
making
device
which
would
deprive
it
of
its
--
which
would
deprive
the
company
of
the
very
dollars
--
of
revenue
that
the
commission
itself
finds
are
needed
in
that
situation
of
course
an
interim
rate
order
may
be
entered
and
this
court
so
held.
i
might
also
point
out
that
in
the
natural
gas
pipeline
company
of
america
case
there
was
no
allocation
issue.
an
order
may
also
be
issued
validly
where
there
is
no
contest
on
allocation.
obviously,
if
the
parties
are
not
fighting
about
the
company's
method,
the
company's
method
it
suggests
is
agreeable
to
the
parties
in
the
case,
there
was
no
argument
and
this
has
happened
many
times.
it
is
not
every
case
where
allocation
is
disputed.
for
18
years
we
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
pardon?
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
i
mean
by
the
allocation
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes.
i
mean
by
the
allocation
issue
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes.
the
question
of
how
the
total
overall
cost
of
service
in
the
aggregate
how
that
should
be
divided
among
the
customers.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes,
that
is
--
that's
right.
that's
the
very
broad
of
course
but
it's
the
best
i
can
do
at
the
moment.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes,
it
does.
the
interim
order
based
the
use
the
allocation
method,
which
we
selected,
for
purposes
of
its
interim
order.
it
is
our
contention
for
the
reasons,
which
i
will
soon
develop,
that
that
cannot
be
done
where
there
is
a
contest
as
here
on
that
question
among
the
customers.
and
where
the
very
--
where
the
commission
would
adopt
that
method
for
interim
order
purposes
only
and
later
on
could
adopt
after
deciding
the
issue
a
different
method
and
thereby
deprive
the
company
of
many
millions
of
dollars
of
its
rate
of
return.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
if
--
yes,
(voice
overlap)
the
commission
should
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes,
that
is
that
the
commission
were
to
later
adopt
a
different
method
and
prescribe
rates
retroactively.
in
other
words,
tell
us
at
the
end
--
tell
us
after
deciding
the
allocation
issue
that
the
very
rates
that
it
ordered
us
to
reduce
shouldn't
have
been
reduced
at
all
or
should've
been
reduced
in
lesser
amounts
and
then
retroactively
decides
that
that
is
the
fact
by
a
different
method
of
allocation
then
we
are
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes
your
honor,
and
let
me
say
that
regard
while
we're
on
that
subject.
i
hope
to
reach
later
at
all
but
(voice
overlap)
but
this
will
be
a
good
time.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
now,
let
me
point
out
here,
if
your
honor
please,
that
as
to
our
ability
to
guess
what
is
the
right
method,
let
me
hasten
to
point
out
that
our
company
was
born
in
1954,
i'm
sorry
1945.
i
have
bad
way
of
reversing
figures
and
during
the
18
years
or
more
of
our
existence,
the
commission
had
never
decided
what
would
be
the
proper
allocation,
cost
allocation
method
for
our
system.
the
commission
had
never
said
any
guidelines
for
us
and
it
had
never
said
any
policy
as
to
how
costs
should
be
allocated.
it
decided
cases
on
a
case-by-case
method.
and
this
case,
the
one
immediately
preceding
it,
was
the
case
which
the
commission
selected
as
the
first
case
in
which
to
decide
that
issue.
at
the
hearing,
there
were
some
five
different
extremely
complicated
methods
of
allocation
presented
and
the
commission
adopted
none
of
them.
it
adopted
the
sixth.
now,
i
say
that
our
chances
of
making
a
correct
guess
as
to
what
method
of
allocation
the
commission
would
adopt
in
this
case
were
practically
new.
but
i
shall
go
into
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
we're
not
asking
the
consumers
to
bear
any
burden
at
all.
we
pay
them
back
all
of
the
money
that
is
due
to
them
when
it
comes
due
at
7%
interest
under
the
refund
provision.
they
can't
be
hurt,
it
seems
to
me,
but
we
can
be
terribly
hurt
by
being
deprived
of
the
very
dollars,
a
good
portion
of
the
very
dollars
which
the
commission
found
in
this
case.
we
need
it
in
order
to
enable
us
to
operate
our
property
and
render
good
service
to
the
customers.
that
--
it
is
in
that
way
that
the
customer
can
really
get
hurt
that
the
customers
and
the
company.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
that
is
a
risk
that
we
would
accept,
that
we
do
accept.
in
other
words,
what
your
honor
is
talking
about
judge
tatel
mentioned
it
too
is
the
risk
where
we
file
rates
that
are
too
lawful,
that
is
that
we
knowingly
and
voluntarily
don't
have
a
enough
sense
but
we
make
the
final.
to
file
rates
under
our
own
methods
that
are
--
is
sufficient
to
recover
our
cost
of
service.
when
we
do
that
and
if
the
commission
should've
at
the
end
of
the
case
prescribe
rates
that
are
higher
than
those
which
we
filed
by
then
of
course
that
is
a
risk
we
undertake
and
we're
certainly
willing
to
accept
it
but
that
--
and
that
is
not
what
we're
complaining
about
here.
what
we're
complaining
about
here
is
that
the
commission
adopted
our
method
of
allocation
for
the
temporary
purpose
of
immediately
reducing
rates
and
by
so
doing
in
view
of
the
facts
of
this
case
because
the
allocation
issue
was
so
bitterly
contested.
we
could
very
well
find
ourselves
in
a
position
where
when
the
commission
does
decide
the
allocation
issue
later
on
just
by
reasonable
shifting
of
the
costs
among
the
various
zones.
we
then
may
find
ourselves
in
a
position
where
we
had
made
refunds
to
customers
which
the
customer
--
which
the
commission
finds
when
it
decides
the
allocation
issue,
it
decides
what's
the
proper
method,
refunds
that
shouldn't
have
been
made
or
should've
been
made
in
lesser
amounts
than
those
which
we
made.
and
we
have
to
pay
for
that
out
of
our
own
pocket.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes,
but
our
risk,
if
your
honor
please,
and
i
think
your
honor
--
your
point
is
an
excellent
one.
the
measure
of
our
risk
is
the
rate
that
we
filed
in
each
zone.
we're
using
the
7%
rate
of
return.
it
is
a
higher
rate
and
gives
us
the
degree
of
protection
in
each
of
these
zones
which
our
--
under
our
filing
there
would
be
no
question
in
our
mind
no
matter
which
of
these
allocation
methods
were
used.
we
were
fully
protected
but
that
risk
if
your
honor
please
must
be
measured
by
the
rate
that
we
filed.
our
burden
issue
your
honor
rightly
pointed
out
is
to
sustain
that
rate.
our
risk
is
measured
by
the
rate
that
we
filed
not
by
the
rate
which
we
would
have
filed
had
we
used
a
6
1/8%
return.
i
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
well,
i
agree
with
the
first
part
of
your
honor's
statement.
it's
the
latter
that
i
cannot
agree
with
for
these
reasons.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes,
if
i
agree
with
that,
i
wouldn't
be
here,
sir.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
i
wish
i
could
but
i
just
can't.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
and
for
this
reason.
i
think
basically,
we
must
and
i
think
this
is
where
the
commission
didn't
think
this
thing
through
with
all
due
respect.
they
ignored
the
real
distinction
between
an
item
in
a
cost
of
service
which
is
claimed
by
the
companies
such
as
an
operating
expense.
incidentally,
let
me
point
out
that
over
half
of
these
rate
increases
involved
in
these
three
pending
cases
involves
money
increases
put
upon
us
by
our
own
producers.
in
other
words,
they're
producer
increases.
we
get
nothing
out
of
that,
we
simply
are
accounted
to
pay
to
those
producers.
now,
an
item
of
expense
or
an
item
in
the
cost
of
service
can
be
accepted
by
the
commission
for
purposes
of
an
interim
order.
in
other
words,
the
commission
can
as
it
did
here
and
we
don't
complain
about
this.
they
can
say,
tennessee
we're
going
to
accept
you
at
your
word
as
to
every
item,
every
dollar
that
you
were
claiming
in
each
of
your
items
in
the
cost
of
service
such
as
cost
of
gas
purchase,
depreciation,
the
rate
of
--
except
for
rate
of
return.
we'll
try
the
rate
of
return
issue,
we'll
reduce
that
$11
million
and
thereby
reduce
your
overall
cost
of
service
by
$11
million.
so
far
so
good,
we
don't
like
the
reduction.
we
took
an
appeal
from
that
reduction
in
the
rate
of
return
from
7%
to
6
1/8%.
we
lost
that
and
so
we're
not
arguing
or
rearguing
that
here.
we
think
that
is
perfectly
valid
but
when
the
commission
accepts
of
item
in
the
cost
of
service
for
that
purpose
accepts
that
no
one
can
be
hurt.
we
can't
claim
anymore
in
dollars
than
we
sought
in
hearing.
we
can't
possibly
claim
anymore.
that
item
has
only
one
way
to
go
and
that
is
down.
in
other
words,
at
that
juncture
of
the
procedure
putting
aside
in
the
allocation
issue,
the
commission
can
properly
say,
“your
total
overall
cost
of
service
should
be
reduced
by
at
least
$11
million
at
this
point.
later
on,
we
may
want
to
reduce
that
more
after
we
hear
the
other
issues.”
we
have
no
complain
about
that,
if
there's
no
allocation
issue.
but
the
issue
of
allocation
is
a
horse
of
an
entirely
different
view
even
if
it
is
the
method
that
we
suggest
that
in
these
circumstances.
for
this
reason,
when
the
dollars
of
total
cost
of
service
or
total
revenues
which
the
commission
finds
are
the
total
dollars
that
we
should
have
and
the
total
dollars
that
we're
entitle
to
collect
in
order
to
render
service
properly
to
our
customers.
when
those
dollars
are
divided
and
distributed
to
the
six
rate
zones
on
our
system,
the
--
that
must
be
done
in
a
proper
manner
otherwise
if
the
commission
uses
one
method
even
though
it'd
be
ours,
for
interim
order
purposes,
and
later
on,
switches
around
after
hearing
and
uses
a
different
method.
then
as
this
case
show,
we
could
be
harmed
millions
of
dollars
and
be
deprived
thereby
of
millions
of
dollars
of
our
cost
of
service.
let
me
illustrate
it,
if
i
may,
your
honors
would
open
please
to
page
594
of
the
record
and
i'm
again
referring
to
the
bottom
page,
you'll
see
a
tabulation.
i'm
not
going
to
unduly
complicate
this.
now,
this
is
a
tabulation
which
appears
in
the
motion
that
we
--
or
the
memorandum
that
we
filed
with
the
commission
objecting
to
interim
more
procedure.
we
were
here
explaining
why
we
were
objecting.
your
honors
will
note
that
there
are
five
columns,
these
--
and
you'll
notice
the
six
zones
which
are
represented
by
the
six
lines
southern,
central,
eastern,
new
england
and
so
forth.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
at
page
594
of
volume
2
of
the
record.
now,
each
of
these
columns
represents
the
costs
as
allocated
that
each
of
these
six
zones
under
each
of
--
under
the
five
methods
that
were
submitted
and
the
first
column
the
one
that
was
submitted
by
columbia.
second,
one
by
consolidated
system,
the
third
by
our
new
england
customers,
fourth
by
the
commission's
staff
and
fifth
by
tennessee
and
you'll
notice
that
in
the
bottom
in
the
bottom
line
that
the
cost
of
service
used
in
each
case
was
approximately
the
same.
there
could
be
some
slight
difference
but
that's
immaterial.
using
the
same
cost
of
service,
which
in
the
case
is
the
staff's
cost
of
service
in
the
previous
docket
number
g-11980,
that's
the
docket
where
the
allocation
issue
was
tried
actually.
3and
the
commission
said,
they
would
use
whatever
method
they
decided,
they're
here.
so,
i'm
going
to
these
figures
that
come
out
of
that
docket
for
illustrative
purposes.
now,
here's
what
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
while
the
commission
would
find
if
it
had
adopted
for
instance
the
staff's
cost
of
service
in
this
case
of
the
total
dollars
at
the
bottom
of
each
of
these
columns.
if
the
columbia
method
were
--
of
allocation
were
used
some
$23,852,000
of
the
total
cost
would
be
allocated
to
new
england
under
columbia's
method.
but
under
our
method,
tennessee's
method,
some
$18,614,000
would
be
allocated
to
new
england.
in
other
words,
there
would
be
a
difference
by
just
by
reason
of
the
shifting
of
cost
between
zones
under
these
different
methods
there
could
be
as
much
as
a
$7
million
a
year
difference
in
the
allocation
in
one
zone
using
the
same
cost
--
the
same
overall
cost
of
service.
now,
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
well,
as
much
as
the
--
i'm
sorry,
i
should've
said
the
new
england
method.
the
new
england
method
it
was
my
fault
i
misled
you.
the
new
england
method
would've
given
--
would've
assessed
$16
million,
$16.8
million
to
the
new
england
zone
and
columbia
$23.5
million,
$7
million
difference
and
of
course
they're
very
different
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
no,
i'm
going
to
--
well,
i'm
just
coming
to
that
next.
if
your
honors
will
please
turn
to
appendix
a
of
the
white
record
which
is
our
brief.
you
will
now
find
--
well,
i
can
only
say
--
i
can
now
come
closer
to
what
may
happen
or
did
happen
in
the
instant
case.
here,
in
the
first
column,
we
show
for
each
of
those
zones
the
revenues
prescribed,
the
revenues,
which
we
would
receive
under
the
interim
rates.
sorry?
mr.
horry
s.
littman
on
page
38,
appendix
a
of
our
white
brief
that
is
some
of
our
brief,
the
tennessee's
brief,
respondent's
brief.
the
last
page
in
that
white
brief.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes
sir.
in
the
first
column,
it
will
be
noted
that
under
the
interim
order,
which
the
commission
prescribed
in
this
proceeding,
you'll
find
the
various
revenues
which
we
would
receive
from
each
of
the
zones
and
i
direct
your
attention
particularly
to
new
england.
here,
we
would
receive
or
we
are
now
receiving
as
a
matter
of
fact
because
we're
now
operating
under
the
rates
which
the
commission
compelled
us
to
produce
$32.9
million.
now,
that
as
mr.
chief
justice
has
pointed
out
was
the
result
of
reducing
a
rate
of
return
by
from
7%
to
6
1/8%
that
is
total
cost
service
by
$11
million
and
using
the
suggested
method
of
allocation,
which
we
suggested.
now,
look
at
column
2,
if
your
honors
please,
if
the
commission
had
done
what
we
implored
them
to
do,
namely
to
decide
that
the
allocation
issue
which
i
think
they
could
have
decided
that
in
there.
then
here's
where
they
would've
come
out
using
the
identical
overall
cost
of
service
reflecting
the
$11
million
reduction
overall
because
if
you
add
at
the
total
figures
in
both
of
these
columns
you'd
come
out
exactly
the
same.
now,
using
the
total
same
cost
of
service,
you
come
out
--
you
would
--
the
commission
would
have
found
that
the
proper
portion
of
the
total
cost
of
service
allocable
to
new
england
was
$34.3
million.
now,
having
made
reductions
under
the
compulsion
of
the
commission's
order
based
on
a
$32.9
million
cost
of
service,
we
could
never
recoup
assuming
that
this
is
what
would
happened
at
the
end
of
the
case.
we
don't
know
what
will
happen
at
the
end
of
the
case.
we
could
never
recoup
the
deficiency
of
$1.4
million
shown
in
column
3.
we
could
never
get
that
back
because
we
could
not
file
increased
rates
retroactively.
we're
stuck
with
a
million
and
a
half
dollars,
which
is
a
part
of
the
very
colors
of
return,
which
the
commission
found
just
and
reasonable
and
which
we
were
entitled
to
receive
simply
because
the
commission
refused
to
decide
this
controverted
allocation
issue
and
adopted
our
method
for
the
temporary
purpose
as
a
temporary
expedient
of
getting
rate
reductions
to
the
consumers.
in
fact,
a
windfall
of
a
--
in
this
case
of
a
million
and
a
half.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
very,
very
clearly.
it
tend
to
refer
me
of
course
to
point
out.
i'm
not
saying
this
is
what's
going
to
happen
at
the
end
of
this
case.
i
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen
frankly.
it
may
come
out
much
worse
than
this
if
for
instance
columbia's
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
sustained.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
there,
the
commission
decided
the
allocation
issue
finally
last
february
and
the
columbia
people
have
taken
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
and
that
matter
is
now
being
briefed.
now,
if
that
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
no,
for
the
district
of
columbia,
i
have
this
number.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
that
--
there
is
no
--
the
third
circuit,
that
was
an
error.
it's
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
that's
where
that
appeal
was
pending.
now,
if
the
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes,
i
have
your
honor.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes,
that
should
be
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
that's
the
only
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
--
yes.
i'm
sorry,
i
should've
found
that
error
myself
but
i
didn't.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes.
yes,
your
honor
and
when
we
say
columbia,
we
use
that
as
a
short
term
--
shorthand
term
for
manufacturers
of
light
and
heat.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
the
method
that
was
used,
the
method
that
the
decision
of
the
federal
power
commission
that
--
that
the
method
that
they
adopted
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
no.
no,
if
your
honor
please.
the
commission
simply
decided
what
method
is
the
proper
method,
they
didn't.
they
did
translate
that
into
dollars
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes.
we
say,
in
other
words,
what
column
2
represents
in
our
brief
is,
we
have
taken
the
method,
which
the
commission
found
last
february
after
deciding
the
allocation
issue
was
the
proper
method.
we
then
applied
it
to
the
total
overall
dollars
of
cost
of
service,
which
the
commission
used
for
purposes
of
order.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
we
did
not
appeal
that
matter.
that
is
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
that
is
correct.
that
method
it
was
not
appeal
by
us,
it
was
fairly
close
to
ours
except
in
the
new
england
zone.
and
i'd
like
to
say
that
further
in
this
regard
that
the
reason
basically
under
the
law
why
we
contend
that
an
order
of
this
kind
is
invalid.
well,
let
me
first
finish
up
the
previous
idea.
if
columbia
--
if
columbia
is
successful
on
that
appeal,
we
can
be
hurt
a
great
deal
more
than
they
shown
in
this
table.
this
table
of
course
reflects
that
the
proposition
or
the
hypothesis
that
we're
going
to
win
all
the
issues
other
than
the
rate
of
return
issue
which
we
have
already
lost.
the
table
in
the
government's
brief
which
appears
at
the
last
page
of
their
brief
shows
what
would
happen
if
the
government
of
if
i
should
say
if
the
federal
power
commission
staff
were
to
be
if
the
commission's
examiner
would
to
be
sustain
in
all
of
the
items
of
cost
of
service
concerning
which
we're
taking
field.
so
as
just
judge
tatel
below
said,
this
thing
was
just
too
much
for
him
to
try
to
predict
what
the
outcome
will
be
and
he
said
he
wasn't
going
to
speculate
and
i
just
can't
speculate
either.
i
do
know,
however,
that
we
have
been
by
this
order,
by
this
method
we
have
been
subjected
to
the
hazard
of
losing
many
dollars
of
our
return.
the
very
rate
of
return
that
the
commission
has
said,
we
were
entitled
to.
now,
the
reason,
basically,
i
should've
gone
to
this
long
time
ago
but
the
reason
basically
why
this
procedure
is
invalid
it
is
because
as
this
court
held
in
the
mobile
case
the
--
under
the
natural
gas
act,
the
commission
reviews
rates
that
are
filed
under
section
4.
and
it
can
--
but
it
can't
set
them
aside
only
upon
making
a
finding
that
those
rates
are
unlawful.
now,
what
we're
saying
here
is
that,
and
what
judge
wisdom
said
in
the
majority
opinion
below,
was
without
first
deciding
the
contested
allocation
issue,
without
first
deciding
what
is
the
proper
method
to
be
used
to
distribute
the
overall
cost
to
the
various
zones.
the
commission
had
no
basis
for
deciding
or
determining
which
of
the
filed
rates
in
the
specific
zones
are
unlawful
the
extent
to
which
individual
rate
should
be
reduced
or
to
whom
refunds
are
due.
now,
we
submit,
that
that
is
absolutely
correct
in
accurate
statement
of
the
situation.
to
be
sure,
the
commission
found
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
they
said
that
but
we
say
they
couldn't
have
known
that.
they
had
no
way
of
knowing
until
they
decided
the
allocation
issue
whether
they
were
or
were
not
in
fact
unlawful.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes,
and
as
i
said
earlier
i
--
we
advised
the
commission
in
this
very
case.
we
said,
it's
perfectly
alright
for
you
to
go
ahead
and
enter
an
interim
order
by
deciding
the
rate
of
return
issue.
but
for
heaven's
sakes,
protect
us
here
by
also
deciding
the
allocation
issue
at
the
same
time.
we
did
not
oppose
the
interim
order
procedure.
we
said
this
in
this
case
if
they
had
decided
the
allocation
issue.
we
said,
look,
you
already
heard
this
issue.
it's
been
fully
heard,
it's
been
fully
briefed,
you
have
it
before
you,
you
can
now
decide
it.
and
the
only
reason
that
took
them
18
months
as
mr.
spritzer
said
it
did
to
decide
the
allocation
issue,
was
because
they
didn't
do
what
we
asked
them
to
do.
namely,
omit
the
intermediate
decision
procedure
as
they
did
in
the
case
of
the
rate
of
return
issue
and
decide
the
allocation
issues
as
well
as
the
rate
of
return
issue.
if
they
had
done
that,
there
might
have
been
a
very
short
delay
a
few
months
but
they
couldn't
have
been
much
delay
because
after
this
case
was
finally
argued
to
the
commission
after
the
examiner
took
a
year
to
hand
down
as
a
report.
and
let
me
say,
he
was
a
very
able
thorough
examiner
but
he
told
us
that
the
hearing
--
the
reason
he
was
going
to
take
a
long
time
to
write
his
report
was
because
he
had
so
much
other
work
to
do,
he
couldn't
get
to
this
case
for
many
months.
the
delay
was
the
commission's
fault
in
not
omitting
the
intermediate
decision
procedure.
we
say,
they
should've
been
just
as
diligent
in
that
regard
so
as
to
protect
us
as
well
as
the
--
in
their
diligence
to
protect
the
consumer.
we
think
both
should've
been
protected
here.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
well,
let
me
--
i
think
i
can
answer
your
question
this
way,
in
this
particular
docket,
19983,
our
total
filing
and
was
$26,590,000,
that's
overall.
the
commission
reduced
those
overall
revenues
by
$11
million.
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
horry
s.
littman
the
commission
here
--
the
commission's
interim
order
here
reduced
those
overall
revenues
by
$11
million
meaning
that
were
collected.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
well,
the
interim
rates
are
smaller.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes,
there
was
$11
million
reduction
overall.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
oh
no,no,
no.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
i'm
sorry.
you
mean
overall?
no,
it
was
--
the
interim
rates
were
less
than
that
which
we
were
asking
overall.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
well,
i
can't
give
you
a
dollar
figure.
i
can
only
say
there
were
$26
million
less
than
the
new
filing
that
have
been
they
were
after
the
new
filing
in
the
last
docket.
i
can't
give
you
the
total
dollars.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
i
think,
perhaps,
i
can
give
that
to
you.
i
think
i
have
made
a
note
here
that
will
help.
the
revenues
overall
at
the
interim
rates
were
approximately
$266
million.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
well,
if
you
add
the
picket,
yes.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
it
was
$26
million
less
than
that.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
approximately,
yes.
yes.
about
42
--
$240
million
approximately
overall.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
the
--
where
the
allocation
issue
is
contested,
they
could
not
deprive
the
rate
until
they
had
decided
that
issue
because
of
the
fact
that
it
without
so
doing
there
had
no
way
of
knowing
whether
those
rates
were
--
as
filed
in
dollars
were
or
were
not
just
and
reasonable.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
no.
if
you're
talking
about
an
interim
order,
i'll
say
no,
they
couldn't.
if
you're
talking
about
a
final
order,
i
say
yes,
they
can.
now,
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
an
interim
order,
no.
they
can't
use
one
method
in
an
interim
order
and
another
method
in
another
order
for
this
reason.
if
they
do
that
then
that
leads
to
the
proposition
that
it
is
inexorable.
the
commission
will
find
for
purposes
of
--
will
find
what
it
issues
its
interim
order
that
the
rates
that
we
filed
in
a
particular
zone
are
not
just
and
reasonable.
and
when
it
uses
a
different
method,
they
later
find
that
the
rate
would
be
filed
in
that
particular
zone
are
in
fact
just
and
reasonable.
now,
there
can't
be
two
inconsistent
findings
that
a
rate
is
just
and
reasonable
and
not
just
and
reasonable,
during
the
same
period
of
time,
any
more
than
two
objects
can
occupy
the
same
space
at
the
same
time.
so,
being
unable
even
if
they
had
thought
our
method
but
i
realize
that
there
--
there
is
a
catchy
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
that's
right.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
that
is
correct.
we
note
--
i
want
to
also
make
it
clear,
we
think
our
method
was
right.
we
suggested
it
to
the
commission.
we
would've
been
perfectly
happy
to
have
the
commission
adopt
it
but
not
for
just
one
purpose
and
not
for
another
but
for
all
purposes.
if
the
commission
adopts
our
method
at
the
end
of
the
case,
that
is
perfectly
alright,
we
have
no
complain.
and
let
me
also
point
out
if
your
honors
please
with
regard
to
allocation.
a
company
is
primarily
interested
of
course
in
recovering
its
total
cost
of
service.
that's
what
it
is
interested
in,
the
rules
require
that
company
to
submit
a
method
of
allocation
as
a
part
of
its
filing.
i
like
to
call
that
a
suggested
method
because
the
company
can't
gain
and
make
a
lot
of
suggesting
one
method
or
another
method.
it
doesn't
stand
to
gain
a
thing
because
when
it
submits
that
method,
the
rates
that
are
produced
by
that
method,
the
rates
that
are
produced
by
applying
that
method
as
a
total
overall
cost
of
service
must
equal
precisely
the
total
overall
revenues
which
those
rates
will
yield
at
the
test
year.
so
we
do
this,
the
commission
requires
us
to
do
it,
we're
perfectly
happy
to
do
it.
but
we
don't
believe
that
the
risk
that
is
imposed
upon
us
by
submitting
a
suggested
method,
wherein
a
case
such
is
this
where
the
commission
has
never
decided
the
allocation,
one
method
of
allocation
should
be
used
suggests
--
submits
to
us
a
risk
similar
to
that
of
a
game
of
russian
roulette.
where
the
commission
will
simply
take
our
method
from
one
purpose,
only
later
on
to
use
it
for
another
purpose,
and
thereby,
deprive
us
of
something
on
the
order
of
--
i
don't
know
how
much
but
it
may
very
well
be
many
millions
of
dollars
of
return.
let
me
say
in
the
very,
very
few
minutes
remaining
for
me
because
i
do
want
to
leave
our
friends
in
columbia
some
time.
i
do
want
to
make
a
quick
reference
to
the
three
cases
that
have
been
referred
to
by
mr.
spritzer
and
let
me
say
those
are
the
only
three
cases
in
the
whole
history
of
the
natural
gas
act
up
to
the
time
that
we
made
our
filing
where
a
commission
--
the
commission
had
ever
entered
an
interim
order.
there
are
only
three
cases,
those
are
the
three
up
to
that
time.
and
as
to
those
three
cases,
they're
discussed
in
our
brief.
i
know
something
about
the
panhandle
case
from
which
the
quotation
was
read
because
i
try
it
before
the
commission
and
argued
it
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
know
that
no
such
issue
was
there
presented
as
in
here,
as
was
here
presented.
there,
the
commission
dismissed
four
issues
one
of
them
being
a
rate
design
or
so-called
you
might
call
it
cost
allocation
issue.
the
court
--
the
commission
dismissed
that
issue
because
it
said,
look
here
just
75
days
before
you
made
this
new
increase
rate
filing,
we
had
decided,
we
just
decided
that
issue.
we're
not
going
to
go
into
it
again.
so,
we're
going
to
dismiss
that
issue
along
with
three
other
issues
that
had
just
been
decided
in
a
case
--
to
the
opinion
that
the
court
--
the
commission
issued
just
75
days
earlier.
so
that
was
the
end
of
the
allocation
issue.
when
we
went
to
court,
the
court
said,
the
commission
was
well
within
its
rights
to
do
that.
and
so,
there
was
no
contested
allocation.
the
court
just
simply
said
there
was
no
contest
of
allocation
issue
in
that
case
and
the
precise
question
that
is
presented
here
was
not
raised
there.
in
the
northern
case,
the
commission
in
the
northern
case
as
the
staff
brief
admits
the
precise
contention
or
issues
there
were
not
the
same
as
they
are
here
because
in
that
case
as
in
the
panhandle
case,
the
commission
had
dismissed
the
allocation
issue
because
it
had
been
decided
and
passed
on
an
earlier
case.
in
the
natural
gas
pipeline
case
of
america,
as
i
stated
earlier,
there
was
no
allocation
issue
because
they
didn't
have
any
zones
on
their
system.
they
had
one
rate
over
the
whole
system
and
moreover
they
were
not
--
they
were
fixing
rates
under
section
5
(a)
where
the
rates
were
fixed
prospectively
only.
now,
just
one
word
then
on
abuse
of
discretion,
briefly
stated
here
the
commission,
and
this
is
the
gist
of
our
argument
that
there
was
a
gross
abuse
of
discretion.
putting
apart
the
requirements
of
the
act
if
the
commission
had
any
discretion
to
exercise
in
this
case,
it
abused
that
discretion
because
here
it
had
a
choice
of
two
alternatives.
one,
was
to
decide
the
allocation
issue
on
the
evidence
that
it
then
have
before
it.
it
might
have
been
a
very
short
delay
occasion.
by
reason
of
that,
i
think
it
took
the
commission
only
four
or
five
--
four
months
or
five
months
to
decide
that
issue
after
the
third
argument
at
the
second
time.
i
might
point
out
the
reason
for
that
being
if
there
was
a
change
in
the
first
note
the
commission
due
to
the
change
in
administration.
that
was
one
of
the
causes
for
its
delay.
all
of
which
could've
been
avoided
if
they
had
omitted
the
intermediate
decision
procedure
that
we
requested.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
but
they
could've
avoid
it
not
to
change
the
administration
and
no
one
suggested
that
but
they
could've
avoid
if
the
delay
had
they
decided
it
a
year,
18
months
earlier.
now,
the
commission
had
the
choice
of
waiting
of
few
months
deciding
this
case,
deciding
what
method
was
the
proper
method
to
be
used
thereby
not
harmed
the
company,
not
subject
as
to
the
hazard
of
losing
a
very
a
portion
of
very
rate
of
return
which
they
said
we
ought
to
have
at
the
same
time,
protecting
the
consumers.
consumers
were
fully
protected
by
the
refunds,
which
incidentally
were
required
to
pay
7%
interest
on
while
we
are
allowed
to
6
1/8%
rate
of
return.
they
were
faced
with
that
alternative
as
against
the
alternative
which
they
did
adopt
which
places
us
in
jeopardy
of
losing
a
large
part
of
the
rate
of
return
to
which
we're
entitled
simply
because
they
wanted
to
save
the
few
months
from
getting
the
--
getting
refunds
to
the
customers.
now,
we
say
that
as
between
those
two
choices,
the
commission
abused
its
discretion
when
it
adopted
the
former,
when
it
adopted
the
latter
revenue
form.
thank
you.
mr.
horry
s.
littman
i
wish
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
oh,
no.
no.
i
know
this
much,
i
have
researched
this
question
but
if
the
brief
once
validly
due
to
the
consumers
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
--
if
consumer
--
if
refunds
are
validly
due
to
consumers
and
the
consumers
have
moved
away,
we
never
get
the
money
back.
the
money
either
goes
to
the
distributors
or
goes
to
the
state.
i
have
never
researched
that
subject.
i
know
it's
a
state
problem
and
i'm
sorry
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
what
the
law
is.
i
would
imagine
it
would
be
different
in
various
jurisdictions.
but
i
do
know
this
that
in
this
case
the
refunds
--
part
of
the
refunds
that
we
made
are
lawfully
--
may
lawfully
be
found
after
the
commission
decides
the
allocation
issue
to
be
due
to
us.
and
we
urge
the
court
of
appeals
to
give
us
a
stay
of
the
commission's
order
so
as
to
avoid
the
difficulty
that
may
come
if
this
order
is
reversed.
but
the
court
did
not
give
us
the
stay
with
judge
wisdom
dissenting.
he
said,
the
commission
should've
put
the
cart
before
the
horse
and
he
would've
given
us
a
stay
but
the
other
two
judges
didn't.
he
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
we
did
not
apply
for
a
stay
here
but
we
did
this,
i
think
the
reason
the
--
i
might
--
well
i
don't
know
whether
that's
the
reason.
but
i
do
know
the
commission
represented
to
the
court
in
our
position
when
it
opposed
to
stay
that
we
could
get
our
money
back
from
our
customers,
our
distributors
if
we
should
prevail
eventually
in
this
case
on
this
issue.
and
i
might
say
that
we
advice
the
company
when
it
made
the
refunds
to
take
the
precaution
of
apprising
our
customers
that
we
would
take
that
position.
so
they
would
be
able
to
protect
themselves
and
perhaps
not
pass
these
refunds
on
without
knowing
just
what
the
--
mr.
horry
s.
littman
we
--
we
made
the
--
we
had
to
make
and
we
did
make
the
refunds
after
the
stay
order
was
denied.
and
i
might
say
just
to
clear
up
one
slight
imperfection
in
mr.
spritzer's
statement.
he
perhaps
left
a
possible
implication
that
we
--
well,
i
don't
say
he
said,
we
didn't
have
to
file
these
interim
rates.
he
said
the
commission
permitted
us
to
file
the
interim
rates.
it's
true
the
order,
the
interim
order
did
use
the
word
“permit”
in
one
paragraph
but
in
the
very
next
paragraph
it
said,
“but
if
you
don't,
we're
going
to
take
a
whole
increase
away
from
you.”
so
i
think
that
is
a
clear
case
of
compulsion
when
we
did
then
file
the
rates
under
compulsion.
