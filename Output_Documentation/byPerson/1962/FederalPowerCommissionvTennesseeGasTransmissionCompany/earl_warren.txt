what
page
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
spritzer,
may
i
ask
what
happened
to
those
first
two
steps?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
they
bothered
to
pay
the
said
amount?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
spritzer,
may
i
ask
one
question?
do
you
happen
to
know
approximately
how
many
of
these
proceedings
have
been
initiated
before
the
commission
since
the
philips
case
and
how
many
of
them
have
been
finally
determined
so
that
their
order
of
the
commission
is
now
effective?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
spritzer,
we
take
so
much
of
your
time,
we
took
five
minutes,
i
think
extra,
we'll
give
you
five
minutes
more
on
your
rebuttal
and
you
may
have
for
your
side
five
minutes
also
gentlemen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rhyne.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
littman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
littman,
doesn't
the
commission
assume
for
the
purposes
of
its
order
that
your
allocation
is
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
the
commission
assumes
for
the
sake
of
its
order
that
your
allocation
is
correct
then
the
only
way
you
could
suffer
would
be
if
your
allocation
is
wrong,
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
could
only
suffer
if
your
allocation
was
wrong?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
could
only
happen
though
if
you
were
wrong.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
have
made
the
original
allocation
wrongly
as
against
some
of
the
regions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
you
want
to
reach
it,
don't
mind
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
should
bear
the
burden
that
if
you're
wrong,
you
or
the
consumers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
the
statutory
responsibility
of
the
company
to
establish
nothing
but
there
and
reasonable
rates
and
if
it
does
establish
any
rates
that
are
greater
than
fair
and
reasonable
rates
that
it
can
--
it
shouldn't
be
in
a
position
to
complain
if
the
government
takes
for
granted
in
its
order
every
factor
that
you
put
into
the
case
except
the
one
that
it
has
established
after
a
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
guess
that
be
your
case,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
didn't
actually
happened
in
this
case,
however
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
change
of
administration?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
littman,
who
in
your
opinion
owns
this
money
that
is
not
distributed
to
consumers?
there's
a
very
large
percentage
of
our
country
is
on
the
moot
every
year
and
that
these
things
continue
over
a
period
of
years,
of
necessity,
a
very
large
part
of
the
refunds,
i
would,
think
could
not
be
made.
now,
who
comes
in
ownership
with
those
--
do
you
claim
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
claim
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
should
the
refunds
be
made
to,
the
distributor
or
to
the
customers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
because
they
don't
move
or
because
they
give
it
back
to
the
dwelling
--
to
the
owner
of
the
premises?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
happen
to
know
that
over
--
over
the
last
25
years
in
my
own
state
we
have
1000
new
comers
every
day
who
come
from
other
parts
of
the
country.
now,
they
use
gas
too
and
--
are
you
going
to
make
the
distribution
to
those
people?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
of
which
might
tend
to
the
conclusion
that
reimbursement
is
not
the
very
adequate
remedy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
would
think
that
would
make
your
interest
more
identical
with
say
the
city
of
pittsburgh
than
it
would
with
the
pipeline
company.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
have
you
been
on
their
side
of
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
been
on
their
side
in
this
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
the
law
prohibits
them
from
doing
that,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
the
commission
prohibited
from
allowing
retroactive
rates?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
would
amount
to,
would
it
not?
that
they
jack
your
rates
up
in
order
to
take
care
of
the
expense
of
tennessee,
they
would
be
giving
tennessee
dating
back
their
rates
to
your
detriment,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
prohibited
by
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
they
have
a
conflict
on
interest
there?
