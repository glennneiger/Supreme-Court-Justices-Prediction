do
you
mean
general

but
your
opponent
really
don't
contest
that
general
right,
they
simply
say
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
the
real
problem
is
that
whether
we
can
deal
with
this
thing
realistically
in
terms
of
the
present
posture
of
things
at
the
time
the
case
is
ordered
as
to
whether
we
have
to
look
back
as
it
was
at
the
time,
that's
really
what
it
comes
down
to.
justice

mr.
rhyne
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
what
happens
to
the
fact
of
the
matter
if
you
can't
find
the
consumer,
what
happens
to
the
refund,
did
the
company
keep
it
or
--?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
mean
that
your
--
your
argument
is
how
long
would
be
until
you
got
an
allocation
procedure.
there's
no
case
where
the
government
issued
a
refund.
would
you
enter
an
order?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
have
to
go
that
far?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
are
those?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
saying
in
effect
is
that
whole
--
this
--
what
you're
referring
to
here
is
acceptance
is
really
not
an
acceptance
of
your
proposition,
it's
also
a
conditional
acceptance
of
your
proposition.
