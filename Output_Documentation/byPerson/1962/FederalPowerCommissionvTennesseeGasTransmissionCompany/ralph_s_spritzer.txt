mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit
involves
an
order
of
the
federal
power
commission
entered
in
a
section
4
rate
proceeding
under
the
natural
gas
act.
it
raises
the
question
and
i
shall
state
it
very
broadly
at
the
outset
in
seek
to
refine
it
later,
whether
the
commission
is
authorized
to
dispose
of
a
portion
of
a
rate
case
in
order
to
relieve
consumers
immediately
of
some
of
the
burdens
of
excessive
charges.
in
advance
of
its
disposition
of
the
entire
proceeding,
the
rate
proponent
here,
the
respondent,
tennessee
gas
transmission
company,
is
an
interstate
pipeline
extending
from
texas
and
louisiana,
its
southern
extremities
to
the
new
england
states
at
the
northern,
doing
business
in
some
16
states.
as
an
interstate
company,
as
your
honors
know,
it
is
obligated
to
file
its
tariffs
with
the
federal
power
commission.
commission
regulations
further
require
that
any
filing
for
increased
rates
and
this
is
an
increase
rate
proceeding
shall
be
accompanied
by
a
full
supporting
statement
as
to
the
costs
of
service
which
are
relied
upon
as
justification
for
the
company's
proposed
rates
or
charges.
it's
to
set
forth
for
example
the
cost
of
its
purchase
to
gas,
the
cost
of
labor,
supplies,
its
estimate
as
to
the
taxes
it
will
pay,
estimated
depreciation
allowance
and
its
claim
for
fair
return
on
its
net
invested
capital.
now,
upon
the
filing
of
the
tariffs
then
the
supporting
statements,
the
commission
is
empowered
in
its
discretion
to
suspend
the
rates
and
to
enter
upon
a
hearing
as
to
their
lawfulness.
this
suspension
is
limited
to
five
months
duration.
thereafter,
the
company
may
make
the
increases
effective
even
though
the
hearing
has
not
yet
been
completed.
in
that
event,
however,
the
company
has
an
obligation
under
the
statute
to
refund
any
portion
of
the
increase
ultimately
found
not
justified,
as
well
as
to
adjust
its
rates
prospectively
to
whatever
level
may
be
prescribe
by
the
commission.
one
further
aspect
of
this
statutory
scheme,
there
is
emphasis
in
our
view.
if
i
may
refer
the
court
to
pages
48
and
49
of
our
brief
where
section
4
(e)
is
set
forth.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
looking
now
at
the
middle
of
page
49,
your
honor.
the
last
four
or
five
lines
of
the
section
provides
at
any
hearing
involving
a
rate
or
charge
sought
to
be
increased.
the
burden
of
proof
to
show
that
the
increased
rate
or
charge
is
just
unreasonable
shall
be
upon
the
natural
gas
company
and
the
commission
shall
give
to
the
hearing
and
decision
of
such
questions
preference
over
other
questions
pending
before
it
and
decide
the
same
as
steadily
as
possible.
now,
this
last
as
not
always
so
easily
accomplished.
tennessee
actually
filed
the
increases,
which
are
involved
in
this
proceeding
in
october
of
1959.
when
those
increased
rates
were
filed,
they
were
already
pending
before
the
commission
two
prior
sets
of
increases;
one,
which
had
been
filed
the
earlier
in
1959,
the
other
filed
back
in
1957.
both
of
which
were
themselves
that
that
stage
in
the
toils
of
the
administrative
process.
i
suppose
you
might
visualize
the
situation
in
terms
of
a
stairway
consisting
of
three
steps.
the
floor
from
which
these
steps
ascend
might
be
said
to
represent
the
rates
as
they
existed
in
1957
when
the
commission
had
last
approved
a
set
of
tennessee
rates.
the
first
step
upward
represents
the
increases
for
which
the
company
filed
in
1957
that
same
year.
the
second
step,
the
increases
for
which
the
company
filed
in
may
of
1959.
the
third
step,
and
that
refer
--
and
that's
the
proceeding
that
is
before
the
court
immediately
at
this
time.
the
increases
which
is
i
indicated
earlier
were
filed
in
october
of
1959.
the
difference
incidentally
in
the
yield
produced
by
the
rates
at
the
floor
level
and
the
yield
which
will
be
produced
at
the
level
of
step
3,
computed
in
terms
of
relatively
current
gas
sales
amounts
to
that
$75
million
a
year.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
are
still
in
administrative
proceedings,
your
honor,
and
i'm
going
to
refer
during
the
argument
to
the
chronology
of
these
various
cases
because
they
do
bear
some
relationship.
we
have
asked
that
--
that
they'll
be
distributed
to
the
court
a
chronology
sheet
which
i
think
may
make
that
easier
to
follow.
as
this
thumbnail
sketch
of
the
three
pending
rate
dockets
does
suggest,
one
of
the
facts
of
life
with
which
the
regulatory
commission
has
had
to
deal.
and
i
think
in
recent
days,
they're
making
various
strenuous
efforts
to
find
ways
and
means
to
deal
with
it,
is
that
the
capacity
of
the
natural
gas
company
to
file
new
sets
of
rates
may
tend
to
outstrip
the
capacity
of
the
agency
to
dispose
of
these
large
and
complex
cases.
and
i
think
that
brings
us
closer
to
the
core
of
this
case
for
the
procedural
device
which
the
commission
has
employed
here
is
one
which
it
is
utilizing
in
this
and
in
other
pipeline
rate
cases
in
an
effort
to
provide
more
promptly
to
consumers
a
measure
of
relief
from
the
burdens
of
rates
which
are
found
to
be
excessive.
now,
the
rates
of
the
pipeline
company
are
aggregates.
by
that,
i
mean,
that
numerous
elements
enter
into
the
cost
of
service.
as
i
mentioned
a
little
earlier
in
speaking
of
the
supporting
statements,
which
a
pipeline
is
required
to
submit
with
its
filing,
there
are
various
components,
how
much
is
the
pipeline
paying
the
producer
for
the
gas,
which
it
purchases
and
it
sends
on
the
customer
companies?
what
is
the
estimate
of
its
annual
payroll?
what
will
it
need
for
taxes
and
depreciation
and
for
fair
return
on
investment?
now,
some
of
these
items
may
well
be
uncontroverted
in
a
particular
case,
others
will
be
challenged
by
various
parties
to
the
proceeding.
characteristically,
some
of
these
issues
are
great
complexity
and
require
many
weeks
or
even
months
of
testimony,
a
protracted
battle
of
the
utility
experts.
others
will
admit
of
more
expeditious
treatment.suppose
that
the
commission
concludes
in
a
particular
case
that
it
may
take
two
or
more
years
to
dispose
of
one
these
large
rate
cases
in
its
entirety.
but
that
one
or
two
controverted
issues,
issues,
which
perhaps
involved
a
substantial
portion
of
the
cost
which
are
seriously
disputed
are
susceptible
of
separate
and
much
earlier
disposition,
can
the
commission
decide
the
one
or
two
issues
accepting
for
purposes
of
its
interim
decision,
the
remaining
claims
of
the
company
assuming
their
correctness
for
the
time
being.
in
other
words,
if
it
finds
that
the
certain
elements
which
it
have
examined,
certain
elements
of
the
company's
claim
have
been
overstated,
can
it,
to
that
extent
order
refunds
for
the
past
and
more
important
late
reductions
for
the
future?
now,
as
i
understand
our
opponent's
brief
here,
tennessee
is
not
urging
a
categorical
no
to
that
question.
rather,
it
seems
to
say
that
perhaps
sometimes
the
commission
might
do
this
but
not
in
this
case.
well,
what
precisely
did
the
commission
do
in
this
case?
the
increases
which
tennessee
proposed
in
october
1959,
were
predicated
in
large
part
upon
a
claim
that
it
was
entitled
to
a
7%
overall
rate
of
return
on
its
net
invested
capital.
this
was
in
contrast
to
the
6%
rate
which
the
commission
had
allowed
tennessee
in
its
last
completed
rate
case.
now,
the
hearings
in
this
case
began
in
february
of
1960.
the
course
so
that
it
shown
by
this
chronology
sheet
in
the
right-hand
column.
tennessee
at
that
hearing
presented
its
direct
evidence,
its
witnesses
within
cross-examined
exclusively
on
the
issue
of
rate
of
return.
thereafter,
the
federal
power
commission
staff
and
those
of
the
interveners
who
wished
to
do
so,
presented
their
testimony
on
that
same
issue
of
rate
of
return
and
their
experts
were
cross-examined.
finally,
tennessee
presented
its
rebuttal
on
rate
of
return.
when
all
of
the
evidence
tendered
on
this
issue
was
in
the
record,
staff
--
commission
staff
counsel
moved,
this
was
in
may
of
1960,
that
the
proceedings
be
divided
into
two
faces.
one,
determination
of
a
proper
rate
of
return
for
this
company,
two,
determination
of
the
remaining
cost
of
service
issues
in
the
case.
he
further
proposed
that
the
examiner's
decision
be
omitted
and
that
the
commission
proceed
to
decide
this
issue
directly.
the
commission
adopted
this
procedure
over
tennessee's
objections.
and
after
hearing
oral
argument
on
the
issue
of
rate
of
return,
wrote
an
opinion
in
august
of
1960
in
which
it
found
that
6
1/8%
would
be
a
just
and
reasonable
return
for
the
company.
by
its
order,
which
is
the
order
here
under
review,
the
commission
did
three
things.
one,
it
disallowed
the
rates
computed
by
tennessee
on
the
basis
of
the
excessive
7%
rate
of
return.
two,
it
directed
tennessee
to
file
substitute
rates,
such
rates
to
be
effective
as
of
the
time
the
disallowed
rates
had
originally
gone
into
effect
which
would
yield
6
1/8%.
three,
it
ordered
tennessee
to
refund
to
its
customers
the
amounts
which
had
already
been
collected
in
excess
of
the
prescribed
interim
rates.
in
its
opinion,
the
commission
pointed
out
that
by
permitting
tennessee
to
file
substitute
rates
based
on
a
proper
rate
of
return.
but
otherwise,
based
in
every
particular
on
the
company's
own
claims
as
to
what
it
was
entitled
to,
tennessee
would
be
placed
in
exactly
the
same
position
that
it
would've
been
in
if
it
had
originally
filed
increased
rates
predicated
upon
a
proper
allowance
for
this
rate
of
return
factor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
but
more
importantly,
i
think,
it
would
relieve
the
consumers
of
the
continuing
burden
of
paying
the
higher
rates
which
the
commission
at
this
point
had
found
to
that
extent
unjustified.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
the
company
under
the
gas
act
has
the
initial
responsibility
of
proposing
rates,
and
that
means
rates
for
all
customers
wherever
situated
regardless
of
their
class
of
service.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
actually,
the
allocation
i
would
say
your
honor,
is
an
element
which
enters
in
to
the
rate
when
the
company
files
it.
it
must
consider
the
situation
of
all
of
the
customers
who
were
being
served.
now,
before
the
fifth
circuit,
tennessee
challenged
both
the
commission's
determination
that
the
6
1/8%
was
a
proper
rate
of
return
and
the
commission's
authority
to
give
immediate
effect
to
that
determination.
on
the
first
question,
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously
sustained
the
commission.
tennessee
did
not
petition
from
that
determination
and
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court.
it
is
now
being
definitively
determined
that
6
1/8%
is
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
of
return.
on
the
second
issue,
namely
whether
the
commission
could
require
an
immediate
reduction
by
virtue
of
its
determination
of
this
portion
of
the
case.
the
court
ruled
against
the
government
with
chief
judge
tatel
dissenting.
in
connection
with
the
court
of
appeals'
ruling,
perhaps
i
should
also
note
that
tennessee
sought
a
stay
before
the
case
was
heard
in
that
court
and
that
stay
was
denied.
moreover,
after
the
case
was
decided,
the
court
of
appeals
stayed
its
mandate.
the
consequence
is
that
the
commission's
order
has
been
continuously
in
effect
and
is
now
in
effect.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
tennessee
refunded
the
amount
which
had
been
collected
in
excess
of
the
interim
rates
prior
to
the
date
of
the
interim
rate
order,
some
$7
million,
it
has
done
so.
and
since
the
date
of
the
interim
order,
tennessee
has
been
charging
the
interim
rates
which
means
that
it
is
--
it
has
been
collecting
since
that
date
approximately
$11
million
a
year
less
than
it
would
have
collected
under
the
disallowed
rates.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
$11
million
a
year
less,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
tennessee
claims
that
it
should
be
permitted
to
go
back
and
to
charge
the
disallowed
rates
and
if
the
commission's
order
should
be
set
aside.
it
claims
further
that
the
way
in
which
the
commission
has
proceeded
exposes
it
to
certain
risks
and
i'm
going
to
attempt
to
develop
that
point
shortly.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
tennessee
claims
that
there
is
an
important
relationship
between
the
amount
it
is
allowed
to
collect
and
the
ultimate
disposition
that
the
allocation
issue
and
that
the
effect
of
reducing
its
collections
at
this
point,
may
prejudice
it
later
when
the
allocation
issue
is
decided.
now,
that's
--
i
have
to
go
through
some
stages
to
develop
that
point.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
so.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
tennessee
is
of
the
view
that
if
the
commission's
order
should
be
set
aside
that
it
could
go
back
and
collect
what
it
has
refunded.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
from
the
consumer
companies,
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
present
rate
is
something
in
between.
it
is
represented
by
the
rates
filed
by
tennessee
when
it
made
its
third
successive
increase
less
that
portion
which
was
cut
out
when
the
commission
said,
you
were
wrong
in
computing
your
--
the
amounts
to
which
you
were
entitled
on
the
basis
of
this
seven
rather
than
of
6
1/8%
of
rate
of
return.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
was
what
sir?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
since
the
last?
yes.
it's
between
14
and
16,
and
since
about
half
of
the
last
increase
was
predicated
upon
a
claim
to
a
higher
rate
of
return,
putting
it
in
terms
of
your
example,
the
reduction
would
have
been
to
15
cents.
all
of
the
other
issues
in
the
case
having
been
reserved
in
the
party's
rights
to
possible
additional
reductions
being
held
in
advance
pending
determination
of
those
issues.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
the
statute
requires
when
the
commission
has
suspended
the
rate
that
the
company
undertake
to
make
refund
at
any
amount
unless
they
found
excesses.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
the
statute
contemplates
an
undertaking,
and
that
was
required
here
and
there
is
a
bond,
definitely
will
make
refund
of
any
amount
ultimately
found
to
be
constitutional.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
if
the
commission's
order
were
set
aside
then
the
now,
disallowed
rates
would
be
reinstated.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
the
distributing
companies
are
the
persons
from
whom
they
collect
under
their
tax.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
pass
it
on
to
the
consumer,
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
you
might
not.
but
the
consumer
company
under
tennessee's
theory
would
be
obligated
assuming
that
the
disallowed
rates
were
illegally
set
aside,
those
disallowed
rates
would
be
reinstated
and
those
would
be
the
lawful
rates
with
the
past
period,
and
tennessee
presumably,
would
seek
to
go
back
and
to
collect
the
difference
which
it
lost
in
the
interim.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
both
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
yes.
it's
quite
possible
that
substantial
portions
of
the
three
increases
which
are
not
yet
been
passed
upon
in
their
totality
and
can't
be
disallowed.
now,
on
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
right
because
the
court
of
appeals
states
its
mandate.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
now,
our
--
the
commission's
legal
position
on
the
merits
of
this
interim
order
procedure
i
think
may
be
very
briefly
stated.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
certainly.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
the
commission
has
decided
that
the
allocation
principles
that
has
not
yet
translated
them
into
newly
prescribed
rates.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
yes.
the
commission's
holding
oral
argument
next
month
on
the
remaining
aspects
of
the
case
at
which
point
presumably
it
will
apply
the
allocation
principles
which
it
has
declared
correct
to
the
rates
and
make
specific
rates
for
the
future.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
until
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
it's
--
since
we
don't
know
how
many
months
it
will
be
before
this
case
is
finally
disposed
of
at
the
administrative
level,
it's
certainly
clear
that
the
case
is
not
moot.
i
agree
with
the
suggestion
that
may
be
implicit
in
your
honor's
question
that
as
time
passes,
the
issue
become
less
and
less
important
for
the
particular
case.
but
were
--
in
terms
of
the
commission's
general
power
to
use
this
method,
this
is
a
very
important
case
because
a
plowed
has
been
passed
upon
its
availability
by
the
decision
below.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
at
least
in
some
its
aspects
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
suggest
that
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
suggest
that
when
--
the
commission
might
not
be
able
to
use
this
method
at
all.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
are
defending
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
primarily
on
the
basis
of
what
might
be
described
as
the
narrower
of
the
two
holdings
in
the
case,
that's
quite
right.
they
are
arguing
primarily
that
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
using
the
procedure
in
this
case,
though
some
of
their
arguments
and
some
of
the
court's
argument
appeared
to
us
to
have
a
broader
thrust
than
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
remaining
issues
relate
to
other
costs
of
service,
which
tennessee
has
claimed,
taxes
and
depreciation
among
others.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
allocation
issue
has
now
--
the
commission
has
come
out
with
an
opinion.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
that's
being
reviewed
in
the
third
circuit.
the
commission
has
come
out
with
its
opinion
on
the
allocation
issue.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon
me?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
actually,
the
review
that
has
been
sought
there
by
one
of
the
customer
companies
rather
than
by
tennessee.
now,
as
to
the
power
of
the
commission
to
use
this
method,
our
basic
position
is
that
tennessee
has
the
burden
of
justifying
each
of
the
component
claims
which
makes
up
the
total
that
it
seeks
to
refute
by
its
rates.
as
to
the
claim
that
it's
entitled
to
a
7%
rate
of
return,
it
failed
to
do
so
after
it
had
a
full
hearing.
and
we
say,
having
had
its
hearing
on
that
issue,
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should
continue
to
collect
any
more
than
it
would've
collected,
had
it
file
its
rates
on
the
basis
of
a
proper
rate
of
return
factor
in
the
first
instance.
we
believe
that
the
commission
under
sections
4
and
5
of
its
act
has
plenary
rate
powers.
and
if
for
purposes
of
proscribing
rates,
the
commission
can
therefore
assume
arguendo
the
correctness
of
the
other
claims
which
are
made
by
the
company.
we
also
point
out
that
section
16
of
the
act,
which
is
the
necessary
and
proper
article
of
this
statute,
authorizes
the
entry
of
any
order
necessary
or
appropriate
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
this
court
has
often
said
that
a
fundamental
purpose
of
the
effect
is
to
afford
prompt
protection
to
consumers.
and
since
the
mechanism
of
possible
refunds
that
a
later
date
is
both
delayed
and
imperfect
and
that's
the
point
which
the
council
for
the
city
of
pittsburgh
is
going
to
develop
at
greater
length
later.
we
think
the
commission
was
well
within
its
authority
in
terminating
tennessee's
effort
to
continue
collections
on
the
basis
of
a
claim
which
had
already
been
found
unjustified.
we
find
support
in
a
number
of
cases
for
the
use
of
this
interim
order
type
procedure.
one
case
in
this
court,
the
natural
gas
pipeline
company
case,
in
the
315
u.s.,
held
that
a
company
which
had
predicated
its
entire
direct
--
which
had
presented
excuse
me,
its
entire
direct
testimony
in
support
of
its
rates,
could
not
complain
that
it
had
not
yet
been
able
to
cross
examine
commission
witnesses
on
aspects
of
the
case,
which
for
purposes
of
the
interim
order,
the
commission
had
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
company's
presentation.
several
other
courts
of
appeals
have
similarly
allowed
use
of
an
interim
order
procedure
to
decide
a
portion
of
a
rate
case.
the
third
circuit's
panhandle
decision
is
close
to
this
one
and
that
it
also
involve
rates
predicated
upon
a
claim
to
an
increase
rate
of
return.
in
that
case,
judge
hastie
spoke
for
the
third
circuit
and
i'd
like
to
refer
for
a
moment
to
one
or
two
sentences
of
his
opinion.
true,
he
said
in
recognition
of
the
time
involved
in
these
often
long
drawn
out
rate
proceedings,
the
commission
quite
properly
permits
the
basic
showing
of
the
justification,
which
existed
at
the
time
of
filing
to
be
supplemented
by
evidence
of
occurrences
since
filing.
but
this
is
far
from
saying
that
a
party
who
tries
and
fails
to
make
a
prima
facie
showing
to
support
severable
elements
of
his
claim
is
entitled
to
a
postponement
of
adjudication
thereon
in
anticipation
of
possible
new
justification
which
some
future
event
may
supply
before
the
overall
case
can
be
completed.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
we
don't
know
what
the
practical
effect
of
the
allocation
will
be
until
the
commission
has
finally
passed
upon
the
remaining
aspects
of
the
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
not
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right,
until
the
commission
decides
the
remaining
issues,
we
don't
know
what
the
consequences
may
be
to
tennessee.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
we
know
that
the
principles
of
allocation
in
which
the
commission
has
decided
may
have
some
impact
on
tennessee
but
we
cannot
possibly
put
aside
the
cost
of
service
issues
or
determine
what
the
impact
will
be
until
those
remaining
issues
are
decided.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
they
may
have
collected
sufficient
amounts
entirely
apart
from
the
impact
of
this
interim
order
so
that
they
earn
the
position
to
earn
the
full
6
1/8%
during
the
interim
period.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
have
to
--
if
they
are
going
to
earn
their
6
1/8%
rate
of
return,
they're
going
to
have
to
earn
it
from
the
customers
who
were
involved
in
this
case,
yes.
now,
perhaps
i
should
turn
without
further
delay
to
tennessee's
contention
that
the
availability
of
the
interim
order
procedure
that
it
is
not
available
in
cases
where
there
is
an
allocation
issue
remaining
to
be
decided.
now,
essentially
what
tennessee
is
saying,
is
that
the
commission's
determination
that
tennessee's
cost
of
service
is
less
than
tennessee
estimated
it
to
be,
will
only
lead
to
proportional
reductions
to
all
customers
of
tennessee,
will
only
lead
to
that
if
one
assumes
that
the
rate
relationships,
the
rates
in
various
zones
are
going
to
remain
intact.
tennessee
says
further,
that
if
it
should
turn
out
that
the
rate
structure
was
all
wrong
in
the
commission's
view,
that
the
rate
structure
was
invalid
or
discriminatory,
then
it
might
be,
it
might
be
that
though
tennessee
in
all
was
entitled
to
collect
only
something
less
than
what
it
sought.
that
nonetheless,
its
rates
to
particular
customers
might
not
be
too
high.
perhaps
i
can
make
this
clearer
by
attempting
an
illustration.
let's
suppose
that
the
tennessee
has
three
zones
rather
than
six
for
simplicity's
sake.
and
that
the
basic
rate
was
60
cents
in
mcf
in
zone
1,
80
cents
in
zone
2
and
a
dollar
in
zone
3,
that
these
are
the
rates
for
which
tennessee
filed
in
order
to
produce
let
us
a
hundred
million
dollar
of
gross
revenues
a
year.
let's
suppose
further
that
as
in
this
case,
the
commission
examined
one
element
of
the
cost
of
service
in
advance
of
the
others
and
said,
you're
wrong,
you're
not
entitled
to
a
$100
million
a
year,
you're
seeking
that
on
a
basis
of
an
inflated
claim
as
to
what
rate
of
return
your
stockholder
should
have.
we
find
that
you're
only
entitled
to
$90
million
a
year.
let
us
suppose
further
that
at
that
point,
the
commission
said,
since
your
total
cost
of
service
we
found
was
exaggerated
by
10%,
we
will
order
a
10%
reduction
across
the
board
from
60,
80
and
a
dollar
to
54,
72
and
90
cents.
i'm
also
assuming
in
this
illustration
for
the
sake
of
simplicity
that
they're
selling
equal
volumes
in
each
zones,
so
you
effectuate
the
reduction
by
a
flat
across
the
board
cut
in
the
rates.
now,
says
tennessee
if
there's
an
allocation
issue
in
the
case,
it
might
turn
out
that
some
of
the
premises
upon
which
we
fixed
rates,
60,
80
and
a
dollar
were
all
wrong.
it
might
turn
out
though
we're
entitled
only
to
$90
million
overall
that
instead
of
cutting
the
rates
equally
10%
in
each
zone,
the
commission
will
ultimately
say
that
they
ought
to
be
cut
15%
in
zones
2
and
3
but
they
should've
remain
the
same
on
zone
1.
in
other
words,
it
should've
remained
at
60
cents
in
zone
1.
now
says,
tennessee
further,
if
the
consequence
of
the
commission's
order
in
its
impact
on
zone
1
is
to
reduce
the
rates
for
that
interim
period
from
60
cents
to
54
cents
and
it
should
ultimately
be
determined
that
the
final
stage
of
the
proceeding
that
we're
entitled
to
60
cents
in
that
zone,
we
will
have
no
way
of
going
back
in
collecting
that
6
cents
difference.
our
answer
to
that
is
that
it
is
the
burden
of
the
company
which
proposes
all
of
the
rates,
the
rates
in
each
zone.
it's
the
burden
of
the
company
to
have
a
nondiscriminatory
rate
structure.
and
if
that
risk
cannot
be
shifted
to
the
consumer,
the
company
is
chargeable
and
the
words
of
section
4
(b)
of
the
statute,
if
it
grants
any
undue
preference
to
any
person
or
maintains
any
unreasonable
difference
as
between
localities
or
as
between
classes
of
service.
we
point
out
further
that
the
risk
of
which
tennessee
complains
is
precisely
the
same
risk
as
it
would've
had
if
it
had
filed
on
the
basis
of
a
proper
rate
of
return,
6
1/8%
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
also
have
the
duty
under
the
statute
to
file
just
and
reasonable
rates
and
rates
which
do
not
discriminate
as
between
any
localities
or
among
any
classes
of
service,
your
honor.
and
our
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
did
not,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
principles
are
determined
but
the
alloca
--
those
principles
have
not
yet
been
applied
to
tennessee's
rates
because
of
the
failure
to
determine
all
of
the
other
cost
of
service
factors.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there's
an
indication
whether
--
yes,
as
to
what
the
adjustments
may
have
to
be.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
there
is
a
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
there
are
still
indeterminate
elements
which
would
have
to
go
into
that
equation.
in
other
words,
it's
theoretically
possible
that
tennessee
would
lose
something
that
it
would
collect
for
the
interim
period
something
less
than
the
permissible
rate
in
one
of
the
zones.
but
whether
that
would
occur
in
fact,
depends
upon
whether
any
of
the
other
claims
of
tennessee
are
inflated.
in
the
illustration
i
gave
before,
where
i
thought
of
this
possibility
of
collecting
54
cents
and
then
finding
the
60
cents
should've
been
collected
all
along.
but
whether
the
company
has
collected
enough
so
that
it
had
a
cushion
against
this
possibility,
depends
upon
whether
the
company's
claims
on
the
other
issues
not
yet
decided
are
found
to
be
wanting
in
some
respects.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
the
commission
follows
the
examiner's
decision,
which
has
now
been
rendered
on
the
other
issues,
tennessee
would
come
out
whole.
because
the
examiner
has
found
that
tennessee
had
inflated
claims
on
other
portions
of
its
cost
of
service,
the
consequence
of
that
is
that
the
adjustments
which
are
being
made
in
the
rate
structure.
the
change
of
the
rate
differentials
will
still
not
result
in
tennessee's
failing
to
collect
for
the
interim
period,
those
amounts,
which
it
would
be
entitled
under
the
commission's
final
order
to
collect.
now
when
i
said,
the
commission's
final
order,
i'm
assuming
for
the
moment
the
commission
agrees
with
the
examiner
whether
it
will
or
will
not,
we
don't
know.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
right.
and
we
have
to
argue
our
case
and
we
do,
on
the
assumption
that
tennessee
might
not
collect
6
1/8%
for
this
interim
period
and
we
do
that
on
the
basis
that
the
risk
of
having
defensible
rate
relationships
is
on
the
company,
that
the
consumers
cannot
be
required
to
pay
on
the
basis
of
inflated
claims
to
furnish
a
cushion
or
a
safeguard
as
against
the
dangerous
that
some
of
the
company's
rate
relationships
for
which
it
is
responsible
may
be
found
discriminatory.
we
say
that
if
the
court
would've
do
that,
they
would
be
doing
nothing
less
than
putting
a
premium
on
the
presentation
of
inflated
claims.
and
in
the
face
of
statute,
we
say,
which
make
that
the
inescapable
duty
of
the
utility
to
file
just,
reasonable
and
nondiscriminatory
charges.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
commission
is
hearing
oral
argument
on
the
remaining
aspects
of
the
case
before
your
honors
in
november
and
i
would
assume
that
the
remaining
aspects
of
this
rate
proceeding
and
probably
the
other
two
rate
proceedings
which
had
now
been
consolidated
would
be
decided
within
the
next
six
months.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
that
is
our
main
concern
because
this
is
a
tool
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
because
if
the
thrust
of
the
opinion
is
that
you
cannot
use
this
interim
procedure
where
there
is
an
issue
of
cost
allocation
pending,
then
the
procedure
has
very
little
utility.
because
as
matters
now
stand,
there
is
scarcely
a
pipeline
rate
case
before
the
commission
in
which
there
is
not
a
bitter
dispute
as
to
the
allocation
of
charges
as
between
different
classes
of
customers.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
so,
you
think
it
would
have
--
if
it
means
that
we
can't
use
in
any
case
where
there's
an
allocation
issue
pending
would
have
a
broad
thrust.
now,
if
you
treated
more
narrowly
than
that,
and
this
isn't
the
point
i
was
able
to
get
to
in
the
brief,
there
is
also
suggestion
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
this
case
to
the
use
the
procedure,
because
the
commission
had
already
taken
evidence
on
the
allocation
issue.
now
that's
a
narrower
holding,
and
our
answer
of
course
to
the
court
of
appeals'
view
as
to
that,
is
that
the
commission
properly
found
that
though
the
evidence
had
been
taken
as
to
cost
allocation
that
it
couldn't
decide
that
issue
as
promptly
as
this.
the
commission
found
that
there
was
a
record
there
of
many
thousands
of
pages.
there
were
90
interveners
interested
in
the
cost
allocation
questions.
the
commission
said,
we
don't
think
we
can
decide
that
issue
without
the
benefit
of
an
examiner's
decision.
it
took
the
examiner
a
year
to
write
its
opinion
in
that
case,
it's
a
130-page
opinion,
it
took
the
commission
two
oral
arguments
thereafter
to
decide
that
issue.
and
so,
it
wasn't
until
18
months
after
this
interim
order
went
into
effect
that
the
allocation
principles
were
actually
decided.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
think
certainly
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
desirable
when
you
have
several
issues,
whatever
they
may
be,
at
the
same
stage
to
decide
them
concurrently.
the
commission
isn't
anxious
to
fragmentize
these
cases
but
they
are
so
huge
and
some
of
the
issues
are
so
long
in
the
deciding
that
if
you
can
cut
out
certain
pieces
you
can
perform
a
service
immediately.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
yes.
i
think
the
--
there
would
still
be
the
question
or
might
be
the
question,
what
were
the
lawful
rates
for
the
interim
period.
so
that
could
have
an
impact
upon
tennessee
as
to
what
they
collects
and
retains
for
that
interim
period.
if
the
commission's
reduction
wasn't
lawful
when
it
was
made
and
if
the
final
disposition
of
the
case
should
be
such
that
tennessee
did
not
collect
from
certain
customers
in
certain
zones,
all
that
it
was
entitled
--
would
be
entitled
to
under
the
final
order.
then
the
question
whether
the
interim
order
was
valid
has
a
direct
economic
consequence.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
question
isn't
liable.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
must
--
i
think
to
give
a
meaningful
answer
to
that
your
honor,
make
a
division
between
the
pipeline
rate
cases
and
the
producer
rate
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
now,
the
commission
has
made
considerable
progress
in
its
pipeline
rate
cases.
it
has
secured
settlements
of
many
of
those
cases
in
the
last
year
or
two.
it
has
disposed
of
more
than
in
the
last
year
or
two
when
it
had
for
a
considerable
period
previously.
and
i
think
the
state
of
its
backlog
in
pipeline
rate
cases
is
far
better
today
than
it
has
been
in
many,
many
years.
the
producer
cases
present
a
quite
different
problem
because
the
commission
in
that
field
has
decided
that
it
is
going
to
adopt
a
quite
new
regulatory
approach
and
it
has
initiated
two
major
proceedings
so-called
area
rate
cases.
the
aim
is
to
decide
what
our
reasonable
or
permissible
rates
for
producers
on
the
basis
of
what
might
be
described
is
a
kind
of
opa
feeling
price
for
an
area
to
take
a
whole
geographic
basin
of
the
country,
certain
parts
of
texas,
when
they
decide
what
a
fair
price
is
for
gas
from
that
area.
it
is
pursuing
that
approach
in
the
case
of
producers
in
lieu
of
the
traditional
case-by-case
company-by-company
approach,
which
has
seemed
to
the
commission
to
present
such
unmanageable
difficulties
in
relation
to
producers.
but
in
terms
of
pipelines,
the
commission
is
now
unhappy
to
say
much
more
current
than
it
has
been
a
long
time.
