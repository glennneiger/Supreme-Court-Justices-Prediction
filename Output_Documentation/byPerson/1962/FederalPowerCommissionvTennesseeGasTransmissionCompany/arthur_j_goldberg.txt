how
about
the
imposed
rates
in
the
first
case
imposed
by

(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.

(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
from
the
consumer?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
spritzer
before
that,
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
with
that
i
would
assume
that
that
came
(inaudible)
solved
in
commission's
decision.

arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
mean
the
service.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
cost
of

issue?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
only
the
cost
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
wouldn't
the
statute
want
to
say
that
during
the
first
instance
(inaudible)
that
they
have
a
burden
of
proof
to
the
jury?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
if
the
cost
of
service
issues
are
decided
and
that
it
appears
on
this
record
then
it
would
be
after
the
allocation
where
the
rate
issue
have
been
decided
and
you
found
that
there
ought
to
be
an
issue
of
refund
would
that
go
then
unfortunately
in
accordance
to
the
allocation
decision?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
isn't
the
risk
is
inevitable
in
this
operation?
suppose
you
got
the
7%
that
you
asked
for
and
there
could
be
subsequent
decision
on
the
allocation
that
would
still
cost
you
money
and
under
your
own
theory
of
the
case,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(voice
