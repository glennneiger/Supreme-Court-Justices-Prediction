mr.
samuel
h.
borenkind
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
the
respondent
in
this
case,
reliance
fuel
oil
corporation
is
a
new
york
corporation
was
engaged
solely
in
the
sale
of
home
heating
fuel
oils
to
customers
who
consume
the
product
within
the
state
of
new
york.
it
is
true
that
it
acquires
its
products
from
the
gulf
oil
corporation
who
is
concededly
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
gulf
refines
its
products,
petroleum
products
in
addition
to
a
number
two
fuel
oil,
outside
of
the
state
of
new
york,
transports
its
products
to
the
city
of
new
york
and
from
the
city
of
new
york,
some
of
its
products
reach
its
ocean
side
terminal.
they
are
loaded
in
stationary
tanks
without
segregation
as
to
customers.
it
is
at
this
point
that
reliance,
as
well
as
many
other
dealers
of
the
gulf
oil
corporation,
remove
the
product
and
either
sell
it
to
customers
within
the
state
of
new
york
where
it
is
consumed
or
reliance
redelivers
it
to
its
own
tanks
in
massapequa,
long
island
from
which
tanks
it
redistributes
it
to
the
customer
where
the
product
is
consumed
and
disappears.
i
have
been
in
this
case
from
its
very
inception
and
i
was
under
the
impression
until
i
heard
argument
of
my
adversary
that
the
board
had
rested
its
theory
of
jurisdiction
insofar
as
a
local
concern
was
concerned,
strictly
on
the
dollar
amount
and
it
need
go
no
further
to
establish
jurisdiction.
that
was
the
position
taken
before
the
board.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
the
questioned
then
before
even
hearings
are
conducted
before
the
board
simply
assessed
to
the
dollar
amount
of
business
done
within
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
dollar
amount
of
purchases
acquired
from
people
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
no
further
questions
were
asked
as
to
what
effect
work
stoppage
would
have
upon
interstate
commerce.
before
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
second
circuit,
the
same
position
was
taken
by
the
board.
and
it
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
we
took
the
position
that
the
re
--
petitioner
had
to
go
a
step
further
in
establishing
jurisdiction.
the
dollar
amount
was
insufficient.
true,
it
is
arguable
that
$500,000
is
a
substantial
amount
in
situations
where
gulf
does
a
gross
annual
business
of
$3.170
billion,
$500
million
may
not
be
so
substantial.
then
again,
there's
been
no
proof
of
any
nature
whatsoever
that
a
work
stoppage
in
this
particular
case
would
have
any
effect
upon
interstate
commerce.
my
adversary
glossed
over
the
fact
that
gulf
in
and
of
itself,
and
it's
conceded,
is
engaged
in
the
retail
and
non-retail
fuel
oil
business.
gulf
could
immediately
step
in,
in
its
retail
operation
and
supply
the
very
customers
supplied
by
reliance
fuel
oil
corp.
without
that
much
interruption
in
the
flow
of
interstate
commerce.
what
my
adversary
intends
to
convey
to
this
court
is
that
we
are
now
practicing
in
a
court
of
convenience.
it's
so
much
easier
to
assume
jurisdiction
if
we
set
forth
the
dollar
amount
and
go
no
further,
but
we
are
not
courts
of
convenience,
we
are
courts
of
law.
the
statute
says
that
the
nlrb
has
jurisdiction
over
all
employers
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
or
whose
business
affects
interstate
commerce.
the
use
of
the
word
effects,
i
place
emphasis
upon
that
word
because
that's
the
word
that
must
be
interpreted
by
this
court.
the
petitioner
must
come
forward
with
proof
in
a
court
of
law
as
to
what
effect
a
work
stoppage
will
have
upon
interstate
commerce.
we
cannot
deal
with
speculation.
we
cannot
deal
with
presumption
because
there
are
no
legal
presumptions
to
substantiate
the
position
of
this
petitioner.
it
seems
that
over
the
years,
the
national
labor
relation
board
has
found
that
in
trying
to
establish
jurisdiction
over
local
concerns
of
why
products
from
people
engaged
in
an
interstate
commerce.
mr.
justice
goldberg
referred
to
the
1958
amendment,
appropriately
so.
in
1950,
the
board
established
certain
standards.
that
was
amended
by
the
board
in
1954
to
increase
these
standards.
any
case
that
fell
below
the
standards,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
issue
might
have
been
in
interstate
commerce
was
immediately
referred
to
the
state
labor
relation
boards.
they
would
take
in
jurisdiction
over
federal
matters
and
as
this
1958
amendment
had
intended
to
correct
this
situation.
mr.
samuel
h.
borenkind
1959,
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice
goldberg.
it's
this
1959
amendment
that
intended
to
create
or
eliminate
the
so-called
no
man's
land.
i'm
glad
to
learn
for
the
first
time
that
the
board
agrees
with
the
position
of
the
respondent
in
that
a
dual
test
is
required
to
determine
jurisdiction.
one,
the
dollar
amount;
two,
what
effect
would
a
work
stoppage
in
reliance's
place
of
business
have
upon
the
flow
of
interstate
commerce,
and
i
say
there's
nothing
before
this
court,
there's
nothing
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
there's
nothing
before
the
board
as
to
what
effect
it
would
have
except
for
the
presumptions
and
the
speculations
adopted
by
the
board
that
$500,000
is
a
substantial
amount
and
its
prima
facie
evidence
of
the
fact
that
interstate
commerce
will
be
effected.
mr.
samuel
h.
borenkind
their
findings
on
35,
judge
--
mr.
samuel
h.
borenkind
the
above
described
unfair
labor
practice
is
tend
to
lead
to
labor
disputes
further
on
obstructing
premise
in
the
free
flow
of
commerce
and
constitute
unfair
labor
practice
affecting
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
section
2,
6,
and
7
of
the
act.
i
say
there
was
no
basis
for
it.
there
were
no
findings
in
that
respect.
there
was
no
proof
in
that
respect
other
than
the
$500,000
limitation.
mr.
samuel
h.
borenkind
i
would
expect
proof
of
this
nature
that
if
there
was
a
work
stoppage,
what
would
gulf
oil
corporation
do
with
6,750,000
gallons
of
retail
fuel
oil
ordinarily
sold
to
the
defendant
or
respondent
reliance
fuel
oil
corp.
we
would
then
come
back
with
rebuttal
proof
as
to
where
that
6
million
gallons
and
how
it
would
reach
the
consumers
of
reliance.
we
were
never
given
that
opportunity.
i
summarize
in
this
respect
--
mr.
samuel
h.
borenkind
yes
judge
white.
mr.
samuel
h.
borenkind
that
is
correct.
i
say,
you've
got
to
go
beyond
the
dollar
amount
to
establish
--
mr.
samuel
h.
borenkind
the
only
proof
before
the
board
was
--
mr.
samuel
h.
borenkind
--
the
dollar
amount.
mr.
samuel
h.
borenkind
to
show
substantiality.
mr.
samuel
h.
borenkind
no
sir,
i
did
not
because
it
was
the
practice
of
the
board
to
assume
jurisdiction
on
dollar
amounts
only.
it
was
only
because
of
this
case
--
mr.
samuel
h.
borenkind
no,
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
h.
borenkind
no,
no,
we
did
not
offer
any
proof
in
that
regard.
mr.
samuel
h.
borenkind
well,
if
those
tanks
were
across
the
river,
i
do
not
think
it
would
have
any
different
effect
that
--
mr.
samuel
h.
borenkind
the
same
effect
is
still
lack
of
effect,
whatever
the
situation
might
be
that
--
mr.
samuel
h.
borenkind
no,
there
would
be
no
question
in
my
mind,
i
think
of
the
jurisdiction
here
because
i
think
under
the
circumstances
we
might
be
considered
if
we
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
but
we
picked
up
our
products
locally
and
sold
it
locally,
it
was
consumed
locally.
and
those
facts
are
conceded.
i
summarize
by
saying
at
the
lowest
peaks
of
an
effect
upon
interstate
commerce
which
is
lacking
in
this
situation
and
congress
if
they
saw
it
fit
to
establish
a
dollar
standard
jurisdiction,
it
would
have
done
so
in
the
act
itself
which
they
did
not
do.
thank
you.
