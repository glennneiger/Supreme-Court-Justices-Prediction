mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
there
is
only
a
single
issue
and
that
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
jurisdiction
here
is
challenged
on
the
ground
that
respondent
reliance’s
operation
are
not
sufficiently
connected
with
interstate
commerce
so
that
a
labor
dispute
arising
there
would
affect
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
trial
examiner
addressed
himself
to
this
question.
he
made
findings
and
he
concluded
that
the
board
had
jurisdiction.
the
board
adopted
the
findings
of
the
examiner
in
this
respect
and
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction.
on
petition
for
enforcement
by
the
board
before
the
court
of
appeal
for
the
second
circuit,
the
findings
on
the
merits
were
approved,
but
the
court
had
some
doubt
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
over
the
dispute
in
question,
but
the
court
didn’t
resolve
that
issue.
it
simply
felt
that
the
findings
were
insufficient
and
therefore
remanded
the
case
to
the
board
in
its
words
to
make
further
findings
--
take
further
evidence
and
make
further
findings
on
the
manner
in
which
the
labor
dispute
at
reliance
affects
or
tends
to
affect
commerce.
the
board
petitioned
for
rehearing
unsuccessfully.
the
court
issued
a
short
supplemental
opinion.
from
the
decision
we're
not
denied
rehearing,
we
applied
--
the
board
applied
to
this
court
for
certiorari
which
was
granted.
the
relevant
jurisdictional
facts
are
these.
reliance
is
a
fuel
oil
dealer
on
long
island
in
new
york
state.
it
sells
fuel
oil
for
heating
purposes
to
homeowners,
all
of
whom
live
on
long
island.
it
also
services
their
burners,
their
oil
burners.
it's
gross
sales
in
1959,
1959
is
the
pertinent
period
because
labor
dispute
charged
here
occurred
in
january
and
february
1960
and
these
were
the
most
recent
figures,
in
1959,
this
company,
reliance,
sold
something
over
six-and-three
quarter
million
gallons
of
fuel
oil
of
a
value
exceeding
half
a
million
dollars.
besides
certain
office
personnel,
supervisors
and
salesman,
the
company
had
21
regular
employees,
11
of
whom
were
truck
drivers,
the
other
10,
service
personnel.
these
21
employees
are
those
that
were
involved
in
the
labor
dispute.
i
won't
detail
the
labor
dispute
the
way
in
which
it
was
resolved
because
that
issue
is
now
before
the
court.
the
--
as
i
say,
the
court
affirmed
the
board's
finding
that
reliance
had
been
guilty
of
unfair
labor
practices
towards
these
21
employees
and
in
an
inappropriate
order
which
was
affirmed
or
which
the
court
indicated
it
would
affirm
if
it
had
not
had
doubts
about
jurisdiction.
getting
back
to
the
jurisdictional
facts,
reliance
buys
this
oil
which
it
sells
to
homeowners
on
long
island.
it
buys
most,
if
not
all
of
this
oil,
from
the
gulf
oil
corporation.
these
purchases
during
the
pertinent
period,
exceed
$650,000
for
the
year.
gulf
oil
corporation
of
course
is
a
large
company,
concededly
involved
in
interstate
commerce,
with
more
than
$3
billion
in
annual
gross
revenues.
now
the
greater
part
of
this
fuel
oil
which
is
sold
by
reliance
on
long
island,
and
which
it
purchases
from
gulf
is
refined
by
gulf
out
of
the
state
of
new
york.
gulf
brings
it
in
from
outside
the
state
into
its
tanks
in
new
york
city.
from
there,
it
ships
a
certain
portion
to
its
tanks,
gulf's
tanks,
at
long
island
from
where
the
company
involved,
reliance
picks
it
up
and
delivers
it
to
its
customers.
summarizing
the
jurisdictional
fact
then,
reliance
locally
sells
a
product
which
has
been
manufactured
out
of
state,
but
which
has
twice
temporarily
come
to
rest
within
the
states.
the
volume
of
these
purchases
is
well
over
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars,
probably
more
than
half
a
million
dollars.
another
fact
that
should
be
emphasized
perhaps
is
that
purchases
by
reliance
are
not
made
through
an
intermediary.
they're
made
directly
from
the
manufacturer,
the
company
involved
in
the
interstate
commerce.
now
on
basis
of
these
facts,
the
board
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction.
that
said
it
didn't
simply
assume
jurisdiction.
it
discussed
the
question,
it
added
specific
findings,
it
concluded
the
jurisdiction
existed.
the
findings
of
the
board
which
takes
three
pages
in
the
record,
pages
10
through
12,
will
bear
out
that
session.
at
the
beginning,
i
like
to
stress
that
the
board
did
not
rest
jurisdiction
solely
on
a
finding
that
its
monetary
standards
were
satisfied.
there's
an
implication
in
the
court
of
appeal
opinion
and
in
the
respondent's
brief
that
what
the
board
did
in
effect
per
se,
this
is
a
retail
concern,
our
discretionary
standard
with
respect
to
retail
concerns
is
the
gross
volume
of
business
standard
of
half
a
million
dollars.
reliance
meets
this
test,
therefore,
we
have
jurisdiction.
the
board
did
not
do
that.
it
found
that
there
was
indeed
more
than
half
a
million
dollars
worth
of
gross
volume
of
business,
but
it
also
separately,
independently
found
that
the
activities
of
reliance
were
so
related
to
interstate
commerce
that
a
shut
down
of
this
plant
would
affect
interstate
commerce
in
the
statutory
and
constitutional
sense.
we
don't
ask
this
court
to
hold
that
every
time
there
is
a
company
which
has
indirectly
imports
of
more
than
x
dollars
and
those
x
dollars
meet
the
discretionary
standards
which
the
board
has
setup,
therefore,
the
board
should
exercise
jurisdiction.
we
recognize
that
the
commerce
clause
is
not
to
be
measured
in
terms
of
rigid
dollars
spent.
this
also
addresses
itself
to
the
contention
that
the
board
in
this
case
has
abandoned
the
case
by
case
approach
and
has
tried
to
find
a
formula
which
is
applicable
in
all
cases.
the
board
did
not
do
that
in
this
case
and
we
do
not
now
urge
the
court
to
adopt
or
to
permit
the
board
to
adopt
any
rigid
formula
for
testing
legal
jurisdiction.
on
the
other
hand,
of
course,
the
importance
of
this
case
if
we
win
it,
is
that
the
decision
will
establish
that
you
don't
have
to
go
into
all
of
the
unique
minutiae
of
every
case
and
that
you
don't
have
to
make
detailed
predictions
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
labor
dispute
will
actually
affect
interstate
commerce
somewhere
along
the
line.
it
seems
to
us
that
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that
were
cited,
all
of
which
are
included
in
the
findings
of
the
trial
examiner,
in
turn
adopted
by
the
board,
there
clearly
was
jurisdiction
under
the
prime
decisions
of
this
court.
so
we
are
faced
with
the
question,
why
wasn't
the
court
of
appeal
satisfied?
well
first
of
all,
we
notice,
i'm
putting
the
two
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeal
together,
the
original
opinion
and
the
short
opinion
rendered
on
but
now
on
rehearing,
that
the
court
approached
this
whole
question
as
one
of
statutory
construction.
in
their
supplemental
opinion,
they
in
effect
conceded
that
congress
might
constitutionally
have
given
the
board
authority
over
a
company
like
reliance
on
the
basis
of
these
indirect
imports,
but
the
court
felt
that
congress
had
confined
the
board
within
narrower
limits.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
goldberg,
it
is
certainly
true
that
by
in
effect
of
freezing
the
lower
limit
of
the
board's
discretionary
standards,
congress
assumed
that
anything
above
that
would
be
within
the
ambit
of
the
commerce
clause.
of
course,
we
can't
rely
too
heavily
on
that
because
we
knew
this
is
a
constitutional
matter
and
congressional
declarations
to
the
contrary,
we
must
still
deal
with
the
commerce
clause
itself.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
had.
now
the
board
does
take
this
position
that
it
is
not
sufficient
to
meet
the
dollar
standards
when
those
dollar
standards
are
simply
in
terms
of
gross
volume
of
business
and
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
imports
or
exports.
and
that
the
standards
which
congress
was
approving,
some
of
them,
like
the
one
in
this
case,
since
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
imports
or
exports,
must
be
added
to
by
an
additional
finding.
but
certainly,
the
congressional
adoption
of
the
board
standards
which
were
then
the
same
as
they
are
now,
it
does
show
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
looking
too
far.
but
in
any
event,
we
don't
have
to
examine
this
question
of
statutory
interpretation
because
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
congress
gave
the
board
in
the
nlra
as
much
jurisdiction
as
it
constitutionally
could.
that
was
decided
back
in
the
days
of
the
edison
case
and
fainblatt.
it
was
reaffirmed
only
recently
in
the
guss
decision.
so
we
view
it
as
a
constitutional
question
and
not
as
a
statutory
interpretation
question.
now
perhaps
this
error
in
the
court
of
appeal
approach
undermines
the
whole
of
their
opinion.
they
were
looking
rather
cautiously
for
an
actual
effect
on
interstate
commerce
in
the
terms
of
the
statute.
they
admitted
that
if
it
were
a
constitutional
question,
it
would
be
jurisdiction,
but
they
thought
the
statute
must
be
more
narrowly
construed.
but
facing
then
the
constitutional
question,
the
question
still
remains
whether
a
shutdown
in
a
business
which
sells
locally,
a
product
which
was
usually
manufactured
out
of
state
affects
interstate
commerce
in
the
constitutional
sense.
to
us,
the
answer
is
obvious
and
it
would
be
pointless
to
demonstrate
that
a
shutdown
at
reliance
would
tend
to
cut
down
gulf's
shipments
to
long
island
which
in
turn
would
affect
gulf's
imports
into
the
state
of
new
york.
so
the
real
question
is
why
wouldn't
this
natural
anticipated
result
take
place?
the
court
of
appeals
had
several
suggestions
on
this
point.
these
are
the
additional
facts
which
they
thought
might
be
relevant
in
that
connection.
i'm
now
reading
from
their
opinion
at
page
169
of
the
record.
we
cannot
tell
from
the
meager
record
before
us
anything
about
the
volume
of
commerce
in
heating
oils
in
the
relevant
market
gulf's
participation
therein,
reliance's
contract
relationship
if
any
with
gulf's
national
distribution
system,
reliance's
proportion
of
gulf's
commerce
in
the
relevant
market,
all
the
number
and
availability
of
ultimate
distributors
to
gulf
and
to
reliance's
customers.
we
think
that
all
of
these
additional
facts
which
the
court
of
appeals
thought
relevant
are
in
fact
irrelevant
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
already
disposed
of
these
arguments.
now
as
to
the
first
one,
reliance's
contract
relationship,
if
any,
with
gulf's
national
distribution
system.
this
is
an
effort
to
assimilate
this
case
with
the
howell
chevrolet
case.
we
can't
say
that
it
would
be
irrelevant
if
such
a
connection
were
established,
but
it
certainly
is
not
a
necessary
premise
for
jurisdiction.
and
in
our
particular
case,
there
is
no
indication
anywhere
in
the
record
that
such
a
connection
does
exist
and
therefore
no
excuse
for
remanding
simply
to
require
us
to
negate
what
the
record
itself
is
already
now
suggests.
and
secondly,
the
court
was
interested
in
the
question
of
the
volume
of
commerce
in
heating
oils
in
the
relevant
market,
gulf's
participation
therein
and
reliance's
proportion
of
gulf's
commerce
in
the
relevant
market.
and
this
sounds
more
like
an
antitrust
case,
factual
finding
than
the
labor
board
jurisdictional
case.
these
facts
might
be
relevant
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
tendency
to
monopolize
or
whether
there
was
a
tendency
to
restrain
competition,
but
they
don't
have
any
relevance
in
determining
effect
on
commerce.
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
percentages
are
irrelevant
in
this
area.
moreover,
even
if
we
conceded
that
in
some
cases,
percentages
might
be
relevant
where
you
have
a
trivial
volume
of
commerce
involved
when
you
have
over
half
a
million
dollars,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
this
is
1%
or
10%
or
50%.
it's
still
more
than
de
minimis.
it's
clear
that
the
elimination
of
half
a
million
dollars
worth
of
commerce
does
affect
commerce
and
we
don't
think
it
necessary
to
pursue
a
demonstration
that
the
relative
percentage
would
make
any
difference.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
right.
now,
the
fact
that
the
congress
chose
$1
million
while
here
we're
dealing
with
half
a
million
dollars
is
certainly
no
indication
that
they
couldn't
have
chosen
lesser
figure,
but
congress
felt
in
that
context
anything
above
that
was
so
clearly
within
the
ambit
of
the
commerce
clause.
there's
no
need
to
make
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now
finally,
the
finding
that
is
suggested
as
required
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
with
reference
to
the
availability
of
ultimate
distributors
to
gulf
and
to
reliance's
customers.
i'm
not
quite
sure
which
part
of
that
clause
means
what
the
distributors
to
gulf
could
mean
gulf's
supplies
or
it
could
mean
gulf's
customers.
now
analyzing
it,
it
must
mean
gulf's
customers
because
gulf's
supplies
have
no
bearing
at
all
in
this
case.
the
distributors
to
reliance's
customers
could
mean
simply
other
sellers
of
fuel
oil
from
whom
reliance's
customers
could
buy
if
reliance
were
out
of
business
temporarily
or
what.
but
that
wouldn't
solve
the
problem
because
these
other
dealers
might
be
selling
local
oil
and
not
out
of
state
oil.
so
it
must
mean
other
sellers
of
gulf
fuel
oil.
so
boiling
down
the
whole
clause,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
only
fact
that
can
conceivably
be
relevant
in
the
court's
mind
is
whether
gulf
has
ultimate
local
distributors
who
could
handle
reliance's
total
of
their
oil.
i
think
the
question
whether
this
is
relevant
or
not
is
determined
by
the
bradford
dyeing
case
in
which
this
court
very
plainly
said
that
it
was
not
material
whether
out
of
state
customers
of
bradford
which
was
in
the
dyeing
finishing
business
could
find
another
rhode
island
firm
to
do
the
same
work
so
as
not
to
interrupt
the
flow
of
commerce,
but
even
if
the
bradford
dyeing
case
doesn't
itself
resolve
the
issue,
it
may
be
appropriate
to
point
out
the
enormous
practical
difficulties
in
determining
whether
a
so-called
available
substitute
outlet
is
really
a
substitute
outlet.
that's
why
you'd
have
to
find
out
whether
you'd
have
to
start
with
a
firm
already
in
business.
the
fact
that
there's
an
existing
demand
or
an
existing
market
is
sufficient
because
it
takes
time
to
setup
a
dealership
in
this
case
to
erect
tanks
and
to
make
the
arrangements
with
the
buyer
himself
and
even
a
temporary
interruption
with
commerce
was
that
--
with
effect
on
that.
and
you
have
to
find
a
dealer
who
is
ready
and
willing
to
handle
the
new
business
because
you
have
to
find
customers,
you
have
to
find
these
customers,
reliance's
customers,
willing
to
switch
their
business
to
the
new
dealer.
next
time
that
gulf
is
ready
and
willing
to
do
business
with
the
new
dealer
and
there
may
be
a
lot
of
reasons
why
it
isn't.
gulf
may
think
we
now
have
three
dealers
who
won
our
product
in
long
island
eliminating
reliance
that
leaves
us
only
two
for
all
we
know
there
will
be
a
strike
of
the
other
two,
it
isn't
worth
importing
this
oil
for
this
market
any
longer.
we
can
sell
it
just
as
profitably
elsewhere
so
we
won't
import
it.
all
i'm
trying
to
show
is
how
complicated,
how
cumbersome,
how
realistically
impossible
it
is
to
determine
in
any
given
case
whether
or
not
there
really
exists
a
substitute
market
for
the
product
which
will
no
longer
be
imported
by
the
company
which
is
suffering
from
a
labor
dispute.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
existence
of
intermediary
i
don't
think
significantly
bears
on
the
question
mr.
justice
black.
i
do
think
that
our
dealing
directly
with
the
importer
tends
to
eliminate
the
possibilities
that
the
connection
becomes
attenuated,
the
connection
into
interstate
commerce.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
frankly
don't
know
mr.
justice
black,
for
the
most
retail
stores
buy
half
a
million
dollars
worth
of
outer
state
products.
now,
of
course
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
[inaudible]
--
the
argument
in
the
first
cases
before
this
court
under
the
act
were
that
the
language
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
was
so
broad,
gave
the
board
such
unlimited
jurisdiction
that
it
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
which
makes
it
all
strange
--
on
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
saying
that
the
same
provisions
which
haven't
changed
since
1935
are
so
narrow
that
they
don't
reach
as
far
as
the
commerce
clause
could
reach.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
your
honor.
i
think
it
may
depend
on
all
the
particular
purpose
of
the
act.
it
may
make
a
difference
whether
you're
dealing
with
wages
or
whether
you're
dealing
with
imports.
the
affects
is
not
necessarily
the
same
even
though
the
same
dollar
volume
is
involved.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct
your
honor.
now,
even
if
we
did
find
this
ultimate
outlet
to
handle
this
–
of
gulf
oil
that
it
formally
had
been
going
to
reliance,
and
we
assume
reliance
is
shutdown,
that
doesn't
necessarily
negate
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
first
of
all,
gulf
has
to
make
new
arrangements
that
may
be
cumbersome,
that
may
be
delayed,
there
may
be
a
temporary
interruption.
but
even
if
there
is
no
interruption
of
the
commerce
at
all,
commerce
has
been
burdened.
it's
been
rendered
more
precarious.
gulf
now
only
has
a
more
limited
number
of
available
outlets.
it's
prospect
of
selling
in
this
area
has
been
reduced.
that
in
itself
is
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
just
as
when
a
state
tax
imposes
a
burden
on
commerce.
it
wouldn't
satisfy
the
commerce
clause
to
show
that
the
out
of
state
seller
is
going
to
export
the
goods
anyway.
it's
made
more
burdensome
in
trying
to
do
so.
it's
made
more
doubtful
whether
he
will
and
that
is
enough
to
show
an
effect,
an
adverse
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
the
main
point
that
we
are
stressing
here
is
that
the
labor
act
deals
in
probabilities.
it
doesn't
deal
in
certainties
and
this
is
necessarily
so
because
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
preventative
and
when
you're
preventing
something
which
has
a
danger
to
obstruct
commerce,
you
can't
ever
be
absolutely
sure
what
would
happen
but
for
the
preventative
measures
taken
by
the
board.
and
it's
unrealistic
to
try
to
determine
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
suggested
that
the
board
tried
to
determine
exactly
what
effects
there
will
be.
but
to
summarize
what
we
hope
this
court
will
settle
in
this
case
is
that
indirect
imports
alone
may
be
a
sufficient
basis
for
asserting
jurisdiction.
and
that
when
the
volume,
or
value
of
these
imported
goods
used
by
an
enterprise
is
so
substantial
that
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
illumination
of
this
particular
customer
will
affect
the
import
as
policy
then
without
any
further
findings,
jurisdiction
may
be
asserted
by
the
board.
