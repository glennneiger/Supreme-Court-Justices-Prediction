mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
and
presents
principally
a
well-defined
and
circumscribed
issue
and
that
is
whether
in
the
particular
legal
and
factual
context
of
these
sit-in
demonstrations
the
arrest,
conviction
and
sentence
to
prison
of
students,
or
the
petitioners
here,
denied
to
them
equal
protection
of
the
law
secured
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
whether
these
judgments
of
conviction
should
be
reversed.
at
the
outset,
before
stating
the
facts
and
elaborating
their
legal
argument,
petitioners
would
like
briefly
to
outline
the
principle
elements
of
this
case
which
as
we
stated
circumscribe
and
define
the
issues
here
and
those
elements
are
that
in
this
case
we
have
first
of
all
state
action
in
the
form
of
an
arrest,
trial,
conviction
and
unless
these
convictions
are
reversed
an
actual
sentence
to
prison.
mr.
jack
greenberg
three
of
the
petitioners
got
30
days,
two
of
them
got
20
days
and
one
of
them
received
15
days.
and
two
of
them,
the
young
ladies
involved,
the
prayer
for
judgment
was
suspended.
secondly,
this
state
action
enforced
racial
discrimination.
thirdly,
in
this
case,
there
has
been
conceded
by
the
state
to
exist
in
north
carolina
a
statewide
custom
of
racial
segregation
and
we
submit
this
custom
has
been
fostered
and
infused
by
a
complex
network
of
state
segregation
laws,
including
an
ordinance
of
the
city
of
durham
requiring
racial
segregation
in
restaurant
facilities.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor
and
we
plan
to
discuss
some
of
the
problems
and
issues
that
that
may
present.
fourth,
the
state
trial
conviction
and
so
forth
that
i've
mentioned
protected
and
asserted
property
right
of
kress'
dime
store.
and
this
so-called
property
right
upon
analysis
turns
out
only
to
be
an
asserted
right
to
exclude
negroes
and
their
white
companions
from
a
single
unseverable
portion
of
an
establishment
open
to
the
general
public
in
which
these
very
petitioners
were
welcome
to
trade
except
at
that
particular
counter
while
being
seated.
fifth,
the
premises
in
question
were
extensively
licensed
and
regulated
by
the
state
with
respect
to
its
service
of
the
public.
and
finally,
the
state
of
north
carolina
contrary
to
the
assumptions
made
by
this
court
in
the
civil
rights
cases
does
not
protect
persons
against
racial
discrimination
in
the
premises
in
question.
petitioners
submit
that
these
very
well
defined
considerations
typical
to
a
very
substantial
extent
of
almost
all
of
the
sit-in
cases
to
find
the
issues
presented
to
this
court
in
a
way
which
makes
unnecessary
for
a
decision
any
of
the
great
variety
of
hypothetical
cases
imagined
by
legal
writers
and
opposing
counsel.
this
case
therefore
does
not
involve
state
enforced
racial
segregation
in
private
homes
or
country
clubs.
it
doesn't
involve
discrimination
against
persons
because
they
may
be
redheads
or
personally
disliked,
personal
enemies
nor
does
it
involve
the
extent
to
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
the
law
of
trusts
in
the
states
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
such
hypothetical
cases
would
call
into
play
countervailing
constitutional
consideration
such
as
rights
of
privacy
and
so
forth
none
of
which
are
involved
in
the
case
now
at
bar.
this
case
involves
only
the
combination
of
the
legal
and
factual
circumstances
of
this
type
of
sit-in
which
i
said
is
typical
of
virtually
all
the
sit-in
cases
not
only
here
but
throughout
the
country.
this
connection
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
was
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
are
i
think
15
or
16
cases
in
this
court
at
this
time
and
i
was
about
to
say
i
particularly
checked
north
carolina
because
i
thought
the
question
might
arise.
there
are
approximately
162
cases
pending
in
north
carolina
in
seven
different
jurisdictions
in
various
stages
of
trial
and
appeal,
all
of
which
have
been
stayed
by
stipulation
awaiting
the
outcome
of
this
case.
and
similar
stipulations,
though
i
don't
have
a
count,
have
been
made
in
other
jurisdictions,
other
states
awaiting
the
outcome
of
these
cases.
but
in
north
carolina
i've
asked
counsel
in
that
state
to
check
and
there
are
1
--
at
least
162
cases
in
seven
different
jurisdictions.
now
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
some
of
them
are
convictions,
some
of
them
are
stayed,
even
pending
trials,
some
of
them
are
in
various
stages
of
appeal,
and
so
forth.
i
didn't
feel
it
would
be
useful
to
classify
them
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
i
do
have
that
information
if
you
want
them.
i
have
it
checked.
mr.
jack
greenberg
counties
and
cities,
yes.
the
facts
of
the
case
can
be
stated
briefly.
in
may
6,
19
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
they
did
not.
for
example
in
rowley
there
was
no
ordinance.
in
monroe
there
is
no
ordinance.
in
charlotte,
i
don't
believe
there
was
an
ordinance.
in
fact
i
think
durham
is
perhaps
the
only
city
in
north
carolina
that
has
one,
but
i
could
get
that
precise
information
too.
i
know
there
are
at
least
a
good
number
that
do
not
have
ones.
mr.
jack
greenberg
since
1940
so
far
i
am
able
to
tell.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
on
may
6,
1960,
the
petitioners
who
are
five
negro
students
from
north
carolina
college
and
two
white
students
from
duke
university
bought
some
small
stationery
items
at
the
counter
at
the
first
floor
of
kress'
in
durham.
kress'
as
i
stated
earlier
serves
negroes
and
whites
without
discrimination
throughout
its
various
50
counters
in
the
store
except
at
a
seated
service
lunch
counter.
there
is
a
stand
up
lunch
counter
at
which
negroes
and
whites
are
served
without
racial
discrimination.
there's
no
racial
sign
at
the
entrance
of
the
store
nor
are
there
any
racial
signs
in
the
store
indicating
this
segregation.
there
was
a
sign
stating
however
invited
guests
and
employees
only.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
think
so
your
honor.
in
discussing
the
application
of
the
ordinance
to
this
case,
i
plan
to
discuss
that
because
our
point
is
the
ordinance
in
this
case
is
not
involved
in
the
technical
orthodox
legal
way
that
an
ordinance
might
be
involved
in
such
a
case,
but
more
as
an
expression
of
community
policy
as
it
affected
the
situation
because
in
fact
the
manager
was
not
and
no
one
has
ever
enforced
the
ordinance
at
that
stand-up
lunch
counter.
and
the
manager
himself
testified
that
it
was
the
custom
of
the
community
he
was
following
and
unlike
in
the
peterson
case
in
south
carolina
where
both
the
manager
and
police
stated
they
were
relying
on
the
ordinance
and
the
gober
case
out
of
birmingham
where
there
was
an
effort
to
develop
the
significance
of
the
ordinance.
in
the
durham
case,
neither
the
state
nor
the
petitioners
view
the
case
as
involving
the
ordinance
in
the
normal
--
in
its
normal
legal
application
because
the
manager
in
fact
was
not
obeying
it
at
stand-up
counters.
so
we
feel
the
ordinance
plays
a
different
kind
of
role
in
this
case
than
it
does
in
the
others.
there
was
a
sign
at
the
lunch
counter
staying
invited
guests
and
employees
only
but
no
invitations
were
sent
out
as
the
manager
states.
he
just
said
that
white
persons
automatically
were
considered
guests
and
negroes
were
not
and
negroes
and
their
white
friends
were
not.
racial
discrimination
was
the
custom
of
the
community
in
north
carolina
and
that's
why
the
manager
said
that
he
was
segregating.
on
page
22
of
the
record,
he
said
that,
“it
is
the
policy
of
our
store
to
wait
on
customers
dependent
upon
the
customs
of
the
community.”
and
lower
down
on
that
page,
it
said,
“even
if
negroes
accompanied
by
white
people
were
orderly
at
our
luncheonette
because
of
the
policy
of
the
community,
we
would
not
serve
them,”
and
that
was
our
policy
prior
to
may
6
in
various
other
places
in
the
record,
page
23
and
44,
he
said
the
same
thing.
the
negro
students
who
ordered
were
not
served.
one
of
their
white
companions,
a
girl
purchased
some
food
and
handed
it
to
a
negro
companion
and
she
was
asked
to
leave
also.
they
were
all
asked
to
leave.
while
they
remain
seated,
the
police
arrived.
it's
not
clear
who
called
them,
asked
the
petitioners
to
leave.
when
they
did
not,
they
were
arrested
for
trespass.
the
petitioners
for
a
long
time
have
been
customers
of
the
store.
they
were
at
this
time
sitting
in
as
part
of
an
informal
student
organization
to
protest
segregation.
they
did
not
desire
to
be
arrested.
they
did
not
expect
to
be
arrested.
they
were
hopeful
that
the
policy
of
the
store
would
change.
they
were
indicted
under
a
north
carolina
statute
which
appears
on
page
2
of
our
brief
which
states,
“trespass
on
land
after
being
forbidden.”
if
any
person
after
being
forbidden
to
do
so
shall
go
--
enter
upon
the
lands
of
another
without
a
license
therefore,
he
shall
be
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor
and
so
forth
and
we
plan
--
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
and
if
there's
time
plan
to
argue
orally
that
this
statute
could
not
possibly
get
any
notice
that
what
these
people
had
done
was
a
crime.
they
were
sentenced
as
i
said
earlier
three
of
the
young
men
got
30
days
in
prison
at
labor,
one
got
20
days
at
labor,
one
got
15
and
the
two
young
ladies
had
prayer
for
judgment
suspended.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
it
was.
they
knew
negroes
were
not
served.
they
were
hopeful
that
as
had
occurred
in
other
communities
that
their
sitting
there
would
induce
the
propriety
to
serve
them
as
indeed
ultimately
it
has
subsequent
to
these
convictions.
i
think
the
record
is
quite
clear
on
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
the
manager
said
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
i
--
i'm
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
may
be
in
error.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
fall
--
that's
correct.
well,
yes,
except
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
on
23,
he
said
i
did
not
seek
police
protection
and
i
may
have
that
confused
but
i
--
we
don't
rely
on
the
fact
that
--
as
to
who
called
the
police
or
deny
them.
yes,
he
did
say,
you're
correct.
yes,
i
was
looking
at
page
23.
in
addition
to
the
--
we
--
this
case
as
i
stated
involves
three
issues;
one,
the
petitioners
denied
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
did
the
statute
give
adequate
notice
that
this
conduct
was
crime
and
were
petitioners
denied
free
speech
secured
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
first
argument,
the
equal
protection
argument
is
that
under
the
well
circumscribed
issues
presented
by
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
criminal
conviction
should
be
reversed
as
denying
equal
protection
of
the
law
secured
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
shelley
against
kraemer,
barrows
against
jackson,
and
girard
college
case
all
make
clear
that
state
enforcement
of
racial
discrimination
even
when
initiated
by
private
persons
denies
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
indeed
this
case,
we
submit
is
stronger
than
shelley
against
kraemer
because
in
shelley,
all
the
state
did
was
hold
its
courts
open
to
suitors
to
come
in
and
enforce
private
agreements
and
here
the
state
has
taken
an
active
initiative
in
prosecuting
sentencing
for
jail
and
in
fact
the
state
prison
system
will
be
employed
here
unless
these
convictions
are
reversed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
then
the
police
told
them
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
then
the
police
officer
also
told
them
to
leave
in
the
presence
of
the
manager
and
when
they
did
not
leave,
they
were
arrested.
i
think
the
actual
warrant,
the
writing
of
the
warrant
was
taken
care
of
later.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
i
don't
believe
that
the
manager
signed
the
warrant.
i
don't
believe
so
and
i
may
be
in
error
and
that
i
will
check
that
but
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
manager
signed
the
warrant.
pardon?
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
moody
said
that
the
warrant
is
not
in
the
record
but
i
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
will
tell
you
(inaudible).
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
was
none.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
supreme
court
language
on
that
is
--
no
statute
of
north
carolina
required
the
exclusion
of
negroes
and
the
white
people
who
are
in
company
with
negroes
in
restaurants.
and
no
statute
in
this
state
forbids
discrimination
by
the
owner
of
the
restaurant
of
people
on
account
of
race
or
color
or
of
white
people
in
company
with
negroes.
that's
on
page
78
of
the
record.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
that
the
role
of
the
ordinance
in
this
case
is
as
an
expression
of
community
custom
because
in
fact
he
was
not
obeying
it
at
the
stand-up
lunch
counter
that
it's
just
merely
one
part
of
a
larger
mosaic
of
north
carolina
laws
as
in
louisiana.
this
case
--
this
court
has
the
same
issue
in
louisiana
where
there
is
no
ordinance
and
it
has
two
cases,
one
from
south
carolina
and
one
from
alabama
where
there
is
an
ordinance.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
that's
correct.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
the
ordinance
was
not
in
issue.
it
was
not
presented
by
either
the
state
or
the
petitioners
in
any
of
the
courts
below
and
the
ordinance
never
has
been
declared
unconstitutional.
my
understanding
is
there
is
some
talk
possibly
about
repealing
it
down
there
but
that
has
not
been
done.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
it
does
not.
no,
it
does
not
take
judicial
notice
of
city
ordinances
and
it
has
so
held
in
state
v.
claiborne
which
is
the
case
we
cite
in
our
brief
when
we
refer
to
the
ordinance.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
law
review
of
the
case
however
is
that
in
view
of
the
rowley
ordinance
placed
in
the
case,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
court
faces
virtually
identical
issue
in
the
lombard
case
from
new
orleans
where
there
is
no
ordinance
that
that
is
not
very
material
in
view
of
the
issues
now
presented.
it
is
not
related
to
any
questions
of
avoidance
of
constitutional
issues
as
the
solicitor
has
suggested
in
the
footnote
in
his
brief.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
i've
been
in
that
store
myself
and
i've
seen
it
myself,
that's
correct.
our
case
is
now
however
that
although
shelley
and
barrows
v.
jackson
and
girard
college
case
all
indicate
that
racial
segregation
even
when
initiated
by
a
private
person,
if
enforced
by
the
state
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
this
case
doesn't
even
present
for
a
decision
of
that
issue
because
here
there
is
much
more.
we
have
for
example
the
fact
that
this
proprietor
acted
in
furtherance
of
a
community
custom
and
that
this
custom
was
generated
in
part,
largest
part
by
state
law.
in
fact,
the
north
carolina
state
advisory
commission
to
the
united
states
commission
on
civil
rights
which
consists
of
a
distinguished
group
of
north
carolinians
has
made
a
study
of
the
racial
segregation
laws
and
ordinances
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
the
study
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
feel
this
ordinance
should
be
given
as
much
significance
as
let
us
say
an
authoritative
work
on
history
which
this
court
might
take
a
look
at
and
say
this
indicates
what
the
general
situation,
general
custom,
general
state
pattern
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
we
do
your
honor.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
yes,
in
fact
we
--
on
page
21
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
it
is
mentioned,
cited
and
the
north
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
we
have
argued
that
north
carolina,
that
the
custom
of
racial
discrimination
is
widespread.
we
have
an
elaborate
argument
to
that
effect
and
the
state
comes
back
in
its
brief
and
says,
“they
don't
see
why
we
say
that.
we're
laboring
the
obvious”
and
i
think
perhaps
we're
laboring
the
obvious.
but
a
distinguished
body
of
north
carolinians
and
north
carolina
state
advisory
committee
and
the
united
states
commission
on
civil
rights
has
concluded
that
these
state
laws
caused
private
individuals
to
discriminate
and
segregate
on
the
basis
of
race
and
otherwise
they
might
not.
we
got
that
cited
in
our
brief
too.
now,
north
carolina
as
in
louisiana
and
in
other
southern
states,
negroes
are
segregated
from
birth
to
the
grave.
there's
an
outgrowth
of
the
state
public
policy
set
forth
in
the
statutes.
when
born,
they
are
born
in
a
segregated
hospital.
their
race
is
recorded
on
a
birth
certificate.
when
they
go
to
school,
despite
the
repeal
of
a
north
carolina
school
segregation
provisions
and
the
decisions
of
this
court,
they
are
assigned
pursuant
to
the
north
carolina
people
assignment
laws
to
segregated
laws
and
the
united
states
commission
on
civil
rights
has
found
as
we
cite
in
our
briefs
that
under
that
people
assignment
law,
not
a
single
white
child
was
assigned
other
than
to
a
white
school
and
a
single
negro
child
into
a
negro
school
as
on
--
upon
that
publication
since
and
there
have
been
a
few.
but
i
believe
it's
correct
to
say
that
there
are
fewer
negroes
in
white
schools
in
the
entire
state
of
north
carolina
certainly
not
many
more
than
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
the
state
public
policy
is
so
well
entrenched,
the
state
law
is
not
necessary.
every
school
board
knows
to
do
it
and
does
it
on
its
own
and
only
after
extensive
litigation
is
this
pattern
will
breach
the
door.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
first
respectfully
submit
that
that
would
be
hypothetical,
hypothetical
and
distinguish
new
york.
new
york
like
--
i
think
every
other
northern
state
has
state
civil
rights
statute
covering
this
and
so
i
just
don't
think
the
case
would
arise
in
that
one.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
that
the
arrest
and
the
conviction
would
be
enough
but
we
don't
have
to
reach
that.
i
think
the
court
might
decide
that
it
is
relevant
to
make
constitutional
distinctions
between
states
which
--
whose
public
policy
support
segregation
and
states
who
do
not
and
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
paradox.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh
there
is
--
i
--
this
case
rest
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
it
rests
on
state
action
and
i
think
this
is
we're
infused
with
state
action
the
arrest,
the
convictions,
to
the
jail
sentence,
to
the
custom
that's
infused
with
state
law.
this
is
not
a
custom
in
the
abstract.
there's
a
tightly
knit
network
of
state
law
supporting
it.
by
licensing,
we've
got
--
this
is
state
action
from
beginning
to
end.
we
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
certainly,
that's
state
action.
and
--
but
that
--
even
that
narrow
question
is
not
presented
here
that
we
have
a
question
of
whether
state
action
in
this
context
of
a
state
custom
of
racial
desegregation
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no
i
am
not
arguing
that
because
this
case
does
not
involve
that
alone.
it
involved
--
it
involves
much
more.
negro
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
their
states
--
some
state
mental
hospitals
and
some
special
hospitals
are
segregated
by
state
statute.
elsewhere
in
the
state,
hos
--
municipal
hospitals,
hospitals
owned
by
authorities,
hospitals
which
receive
money
under
the
federal
hill-burton
act
are,
i
would
say,
almost
entirely
segregated,
but
one
or
two
exceptions.
and
why
it
--
well,
it
may
not
be
by
state
law,
it
is
state
action
in
the
sense
that
these
are
government
officers
and
government
money
and
government
institutions.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
is
for
specific
classes
of
hospitals,
mental
hospitals,
i
think,
institutions
for
the
blind
and
deaf,
tubercular
homes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
there's
no
state
statute
requiring
that
but
again
the
united
states
commission
on
civil
rights
had
a
study
of
hospitals
in
north
carolina
and
anyone
familiar
with
the
situation
of
the
general
pattern
is
not
only
segregation
as
to
patients
but
as
to
physicians
and
their
opportunities
to
practice
in
the
hospitals
pending
litigation
involving
that
now.
mr.
jack
greenberg
municipal
authority
hospitals,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
our
position
is
the
latter
because
we
feel
that's
all
that's
presented
here
at
this
time.
in
addition,
there
is
even
more
state
action
involved.
there's
the
expense
of
licensing
of
these
premises.
we
don't
have
to
consider
whether
anyone
or
two
of
these
things
lead
to
the
result
though
you
have
all
five
or
six
put
together
and
hoping
it's
locked
up
that
way,
i
think
that
there
can
be
no
other
result.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
totality,
yes
and
it's
not
a
--
just
kind
of
an
ad
hoc
totality,
it
is
a
totality
with
a
rationale.
it's
a
totality
that
one
often
--
that
one
finds
as
typical
of
all
of
these
sit-in
cases
were
faced
with.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
i
would
--
we're
not
faced
with
that
and
you
could
not
make
that
statement
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
would
just
first
say
that
this
wouldn't
happen
in
montana
or
if
it
did
it
would
be
taken
care
of
by
state
law.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no
it
would
not
be
the
present,
assuming
the
state
law
were
not
enforced
in
this
situation.
you
would
not
be
able
to
make
the
present
argument
and
i
don't
think
that's
a
paradox.
i
think
it
--
so,
you
can
make
a
valid
constitutional
distinction
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
that
is
my
argument,
yes
sir.
again,
going
through
the
entire
pattern
of
segregation
that
there
is
in
north
carolina
where
negroes
go
to
work
in
plants,
factories.
these
are
segregated
by
late
--
by
race
and
in
some
respects,
that's
required
by
state
and
municipal
law.
and
they
pay
taxes,
the
tax
rules
are
segregated.
when
they
marry
by
constitution,
they
may
marry
only
members
of
their
own
race
and
race
is
recorded
on
the
marriage
certificate.
should
they
attempt
to
serve
their
country
in
the
national
guard,
they
must
be
segregated.
and
indeed
there
is
a
specific
statute
that
a
negro
may
never
command
a
white
man.
and
if
anything,
this
really
indicates
the
subordinate
role
which
the
state
law
has
intend
--
intensely
placed
negroes
in.
should
they
unfortunately
enough
to
go
to
a
mental
institution,
orphanage,
school
for
the
blind
and
deaf,
training
school
or
prison,
it
must
be
segregated.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
believe
that's
true,
no
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that's
true.
mr.
jack
greenberg
at
least
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
when
i
had
occasioned
to
check
a
number
of
years
ago,
i
was
told
that's
not
true.
there
are
some
arguments
as
to
whether
or
not
there's
voluntary
self-segregation
and
so
forth.
i
don't
know.
mr.
jack
greenberg
should
a
negro
fall
into
difficulty
with
the
law
as
these
petitioners
did,
the
indictments,
as
the
indictments
in
this
case
note
their
race.
should
they
purchase
insurance
to
a
fraternal
benefit
society
that
must
be
a
racially
segregated
one
by
state
law.
and
when
they
die
the
cemeteries
in
which
they
are
buried
are
segregated
and
one
of
the
reasons
i
went
through
this
is
to
show
this
is
precisely
the
situation
that
we
have
in
new
orleans
and
louisiana.
perhaps
it's
a
little
worse
down
there
in
terms
of
state
law
but
at
the
same
order
of
magnitude
where
there
is
no
ordinance
and
so
this
ordinance
is
merely
a
part
of
the
entire
picture.
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
the
national
guard.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
yes,
in
the
national
--
may
not
command,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
moreover,
as
i
pointed
out
in
answer
to
questions
earlier,
this
is
not
a
private
home
or
a
private
institution.
it's
extensively
licensed
and
regulated
by
the
state
and
by
the
municipality
and
all
these
licensing
regulations
statutes
as
set
forth
in
our
brief.
and
among
other
things,
the
licensing
form
requires
a
grading
according
to
the
quality
of
establishment
which
must
take
into
account
racial
segregation
in
toilet
facilities
in
all
these
various
licenses.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
that
would
not
change
my
argument,
but
this
again
is
part
of
this
totality.
if
all
that
it
were
licensing,
of
course
it
would
change
the
argument
but
i
think
you
consider
the
licensing
in
conjunction
with
everything
else.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
it
is
one
of
the
factors
to
be
taken
into
account
along
with
the
others
that
i've
mentioned
as
to
whether
these
convictions
should
to
be
reversed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
of
course
is
involved,
yes.
and
if
he
can
choose
them,
can
he
choose
on
the
basis
of
race
and
then
can
he
require
the
state
to
enforce
this
by
arrest.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
that
helps
determine
what
his
right
is
to
the
extent
that
it
can
be
enforced
by
the
police.
if
there
were
but
one
or
two
segregation
laws
in
the
state,
i
mean
it
is
a
spectrum
in
a
sliding
scale,
but
when
you
reach
a
state
which
segregates
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
by
state
statute,
constitution,
and
municipal
ordinance,
and
you
have
all
these
other
factors
involved,
i
think
that
is
a
totality
of
state
action
as
in
another
sense
it
was
set
forth
in
the
burton
case,
the
wilmington
parking
authority
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
first
of
all,
this
case
--
in
this
case
he
invited
the
petitioners
into
his
place.
i
don't
think
this
is
a
case
which
involves
people
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
no.
he
invited
them
into
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
that
if
i
may
respectfully
say
so
places
makes
the
question
too
broad
and
i
want
--
didn't
want
to
just
at
this
point
get
to
a
question
of
what
is
the
property
right
involved
here
because
i
think
that's
important.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
certainly
is
our
position.
that
is
another
part.
this
was
the
--
this
was
the
choice.
this
is
a
manager
of
the
corporate
dime
store,
it
wasn't
his
choice
or
it
wasn't
the
choice
of
the
national
management.
in
fact,
if
you
read
all
these
records
and
in
the
other
cases
pending
here,
it
is
uniform
throughout
and
every
manager
says
and
apparently
instructions
were
sent
out
to
them,
we
follow
the
custom
of
the
community.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
was
no
--
certainly
there
was
no
--
getting
a
[inaudible]
questions
of
free
will.
there
was
no
real
free
will
here
because
this
was
the
custom
of
the
community
and
this
custom
could
not
exist
in
a
vacuum.
this
custom
was
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
say
we
would
even
have
a
different
case
here
if
the
manager
said
that,
“i
am
doing
this
as
a
matter
free
choice”.
you
would
then
have
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
could
have
free
choice
in
such
a
legal
and
factual
context,
but
he
doesn't
even
assert
that.
he
says,
“i'm
--
i
merely
reflect
the
community,”
that's
all
he
said.
there's
no
privacy.
this
is
not
a
home
--
like
a
home.
he's
invited
these
people
into
the
store.
he
has
solicited
their
trade
and
many
of
them
traded
there
a
long
time
before,
before
this
question
ever
arose.
mr.
jack
greenberg
saying
invited
guests
only.
he
didn't
even
have
a
sign
saying,
no
negroes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
jack
greenberg
but
then
he
said
he
doesn't
send
out
invitations
to
anybody.
any
white
person
can
sit
there
and
is
automatically
considered
to
be
invited
and
any
negro
is
automatically
considered
not
to
be
invited
and
any
white
person
who's
a
friend
of
a
negro
is
automatically
uninvited.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
was
just
about
to
get
to
the
property
argument
at
this
point
and
our
argument
on
this
point
is
that
it
is
important
first
of
all
to
analyze
just
what
is
the
property
right
involved
in
this
case.
this
manager
did
not
seek
to
keep
all
persons
out
of
the
store
or
even
negroes
out
of
the
store.
he
welcomed
their
trade.
he
merely
wanted
that
an
un-severed
part
of
the
store
to
segregate
them
on
the
basis
of
race
at
this
particular
lunch
counter.
he
was
willing
to
serve
them
standing
up.
they
didn't
want
to
go
into
the
office
where
the
employees
are
allowed,
or
to
his
private
home
or
his
club.
the
property
right
he
was
asserting
in
this
case
simply
upon
analysis
of
a
property
is
just
a
bundle
and
[inaudible]
--
of
rights
and
privileges
as
justice
cardozo
said,
the
property
right
was
the
right
to
discriminate
racially
against
an
invited
customer
at
this
particular
portion
of
the
store.
now
while
that
may
be
called
a
property
right
is,
any
relation
--
legal
relationship
among
persons
with
regard
to
things
may
be
called
a
property
right,
we
submit
that
it
is
not
a
property
right
of
such
dignity.
in
fact,
it
is
odious
to
our
institution
that
it
can
stand
up
against
the
high
purposes
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so
we
think
it's
im
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i'm
saying
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
am
--
part
of
my
problems
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
part
of
this
problem
i'm
arguing
is
i'm
trying
to
bring
all
these
many
things
together
and
when
i'm
arguing
one
i
don't
mean
to
exclude
the
others.
what
he
was
asserting
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
at
all
the
counters?
i
think
several
weeks
or
months
after
these
demonstrations,
after
these
arrests,
he
just
started
serving
everybody
at
the
--
in
fact
all
the
stores
got
together
and
apparently
came
to
an
agreement.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
yes,
that
has
always
been
true,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
only
--
the
only
community
custom
was
the
segregation
and
as
is
well
known
to
sit
down
together
and
eat,
that
is
the
anathema
and
that
is
the
community
custom
he
was
enforcing
there
and
he
said
so.
he
said,
all
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
except
food
while
seated.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct,
yes.
and
that
of
course
is
one
of
the
symbolic
keystones
of
segregation.
the
sitting
down
together
and
eating
even
at
the
kress's
dime
store.
mr.
jack
greenberg
kress?
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
he
never
really
asserted
any
private
right.
he
said
the
only
thing
i'm
asserting
here
is
something
the
state
is
requiring
me
to
do
or
asking
me
to
do.
that's
the
only
thing
i'm
asserting.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
i
don't
want
to
be
misleading.
i
didn't
--
he
--
that
isn't
his
exact
words.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
he
didn't
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
want
to
be
misleading
by
that.
on
page
22,
he
said
that,
“it
is
the
policy
of
our
store
to
wait
on
customers
depended
upon
the
customs
of
the
community.
it
is
not
the
custom
of
the
community
to
serve
negroes
in
the
basement
luncheonette.
even
if
negroes
accompany”
--
i'm
reading
22
and
23.
“even
if
negroes
accompanied
by
white
people
were
orderly
at
our
luncheonette
because
of
the
policy
of
the
community,
we
would
not
serve
them.
white
people
are
considered
guests”
and
on
page
44,
he
told
one
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
“the
custom
has
not
been
changed
and
you
will
have
to
leave.”
mr.
jack
greenberg
he
was
manager
of
a
national
corporation.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
that's
absolutely
correct
and
so
that
any
assertions
of
private
choice
here
attenuated
twice.
first,
it's
the
custom
of
the
community
and
second
it's
the
national
chain
at
its
headquarters
in
new
york
that
says
that
you
shall
follow
the
custom
of
the
community
and
that's
all
the
manager
does.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
don't
know
how
free
it
was.
i
think
they
felt
they
had
to
follow
it
if
they
wanted
to
do
business
down
there.--
mr.
jack
greenberg
they
were
not
coerced
in
the
normal
sense
of
the
word,
no.
they
were
not
because
even
that
ordinance
there
was
not
being
followed
at
the
stand
up
counter.
they're
not
being
coerced
in
that
sense,
but
i'm
trying
to
say,
any
consideration
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
did
not.
it
said,
“we
are
following
the
custom
of
the
community.”
it
didn't
say
that
kress'
feels
this
way
or
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
they
did
it.
since
they
want
to
do
business
down
there,
i
assumed
they
did
it
because
they
feel
they
had
to
do
it.
their
motivations
were
not
explored
beyond
that
but
any
considerations
of
privacy
that
might
be
involved
in
a
home
or
even
in
a
corner
luncheonette
with
half
a
dozen
seats
so
forth
are
hardly
at
issue
in
a
case
like
this
where
we
--
as
i
say,
have
a
national
corporation
with
the
policy
made
in
new
york
to
follow
the
custom
of
the
community
and
they
follow
the
custom
of
the
community
and
even
this
custom
of
the
community
is
not
something
entirely
a
part
from
state
law.
the
scaffolding
was
the
state
law
and
when
the
concrete
hardened,
there,
we
are
stuck
with
it
and
you
just
can't
completely
divide
the
two.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
they
are,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
that
is
the
premise
of
their
state
action
in
this
case
from
the
beginning
to
end.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
of
course
it
was
coercive
in
the
sense
that
they
were
coerced.
they
followed
it.
they
would
not
have
followed
it
unless
they
felt
that
they
had
to.
so
they
were
coerced
by
the
state
action.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
in
this
particular
case,
the
kress'
management
has
announced
that
is
there
company
policy
to
follow
the
custom
of
the
community.
mr.
jack
greenberg
because
they
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
because
the
totality
of
the
state
law
and
the
custom
which
that
law
has
induced
and
infused,
if
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
of
course
but
that
is
of
course
inseparable
from
everything
else
that's
going
on
in
the
community.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
--
there
were
--
of
course
there
is
coercion
of
the
petitioners.
i
mean
they
have
been
arrested
and
sentenced
to
jail.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct
but
our
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
our
argument
concerning
custom
is
also
addressed
to
the
--
such
considerations
of
private
property
in
the
sense
of
privacy
that
may
be
urged
in
this
case.
this
is
not
a
private
choice
as
one
would
make
concerning
his
personal
friends
or
concerning
a
private
home.
this
is
a
community
choice
that
has
been
imposed
upon
the
man.
mr.
jack
greenberg
our
argument
is
that
we
have
a
totality
of
state
action
here
from
beginning
to
end
of
various
sorts
impinging
upon
the
case
in
various
different
ways.
mr.
jack
greenberg
certainly
this
--
i
don't
think
a
state
has
the
power
to
persuade
in
this
area
even.
so
far
as
the
--
so
far
as
the
state
parks
are
concerned
in
north
carolina
the
civil
rights
commission
has
found
in
north
carolina
states
that
they
don't
exclude
negroes
in
white
state
parks
but
they
tell
them
they
think
they
ought
to
go
somewhere
else.
i
don't
think
the
state
has
the
right
to
do
that.
i
think
it's
the
same
sort
of
thing.
if
you're
starting
with
the
arrest
and
the
conviction
and
you
have
a
licensed
premises
and
you
have
a
proprietor
who
is
not
expressing
his
own
choice
or
indeed
the
choice
of
the
management
down
there
but
policy
of
the
national
corporation
and
you
have
no
privacy
involved
at
all.
mr.
jack
greenberg
an
action
against
whom?
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
you
see
in
that
case
there
would
not
be
the
arrest
and
the
conviction
that
we
have
in
this
particular
case
and
i
would
urge
that
result
if
that
would
--
i
don't
feel
that's
necessary
in
the
context
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
leads
to
that
result.
i
think
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
because
you
would
not
in
--
the
restaurateur
would
not
be
the
man
who
arrested
and
convicted
them,
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
put
them
in
jail.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
but
it's
not
independent
of
it.
in
fact,
i
think
the
arrest
and
the
conviction
are
perhaps
the
most
crucial
part
of
the
whole
thing
but
we
don't
have
to
consider
whether
that
alone
makes
the
case
because
we
have
all
these
other
things
as
well.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
we
have
an
arrest,
trial,
conviction,
and
we're
going
to
have
a
prison
sentence,
unless
the
conviction
is
reversed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
have
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
have
a
conceded
statewide
custom
of
segregation
which
is
induced
by
state
law.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
there
is
a
conceded
statewide
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
on
page
13
of
the
brief
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
the
respondents
faced
the
charges
with
following
a
custom
of
segregation
is
indeed
emphasizing
the
obvious
and
represents
an
attempt
to
convert
the
well
known
facts
of
a
great
discovery.
and
on
page
14,
it
is
submitted
therefore
that
before
we
are
condemned
they're
now
held
up
to
scorn
because
we
thought
we
could
choose
our
associates.
it
should
be
remembered
in
fact
it
should
not
be
forgotten
at
all
that
prior
to
1954,
we
have
judicial
sanction
and
approval
for
our
customs
and
practices
in
the
court
of
federal
and
state
courts.
and
we
submit
that
you
just
cannot
have
this
tightly
knit
network
of
state
laws
without
it
affecting
private
action
and
indeed
the
north
carolina
advisory
commission
to
the
united
states
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
it
would
go
a
long
way
just
to
begin
the
attenuation
of
that
custom.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
but
i
think
the
converse
also
is
true.
mr.
jack
greenberg
must
produce
the
custom?
mr.
jack
greenberg
our
argument
is
not
based
solely
on
that
premise.
our
oral
argument
includes
that
premise
that
state
law
does
induce
custom,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
it
worked
both
ways
but
i
think
when
the
law
in
turn
reinforces
the
customs,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that
was
what
has
happened.
it
was
the
additional
incentive
that
these
demonstrations
gave
him,
yes.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
if
i
may.
mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
concerning
the
durham
schools
and
school
segregation,
in
north
carolina
generally,
i
respectfully
refer
to
the
court
to
the
recently
decided
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
sitting
en
banc
in
wheeler
against
the
school
board
of
the
city
of
durham
which
case
went
on
for
a
period
of
over
three
years
until
judge
stanley
was
unanimously
reversed
and
at
this
time,
approximately
40
some
odd
children
are
being
admitted
to
the
durham
city
schools.
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
was
not
by
court
order
but
the
court
order
is
on
the
way.
that's
true
that
the
court
order
has
not
yet
--
there
has
not
yet
been
a
hearing
on
the
order,
but
there
has
been
a
unanimous
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
following
three
years
of
litigation
during
which
they
kept
separate
school
zones
and
they
still
have
them
at
this
time
so
far
as
i
know.
secondly,
the
main
point
that
i'm
afraid
that
i
got
away
from
during
the
argument
was
that
this
is
not
a
case
involving
redheads
or
hatfields
or
mccoys.
this
is
a
case
involving
the
question
of
racial
segregation
and
i
would
like
just
to
read
a
few
sentences
from
the
conclusion
of
the
shelley
opinion
which
i
think
is
crucial
here.
that
is
that
the
historical
context
in
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
became
a
part
of
the
constitution
should
not
be
forgotten.
whatever
else
the
framers
sought
to
achieve,
it
is
clear
that
the
matter
of
primary
concern
with
the
establishment
of
equality
in
the
enjoyment
of
basic
civil
and
political
rights
and
the
preservation
of
those
rights
from
discriminatory
action
on
the
part
of
the
states
based
on
considerations
of
race
or
color.
75
years
ago,
this
court
announced
that
the
provisions
of
the
amendment
are
to
be
construed
with
this
fundamental
purpose
in
mind.
and
we
submit
as
we
did
at
the
outset
that
there
is
more
state
action
here
than
in
shelley
and
the
state
action
bites
more
deeply.
here
the
courts
have
not
held
themselves
open
to
persons
who
have
agreed
to
discriminate
and
said
that
we
will
implement
your
agreement.
here,
the
state
has
taken
an
active
initiative
in
prosecuting
and
trying
these
students
and
it
threatens
as
i
said
to
send
to
jail
unless
these
judgments
are
reversed.
shelley,
i
was
said
involved
some
sort
of
a
two-party
contract
in
which
both
parties
agree
but
that
is
not
so.
shelley
was
a
tripartite
or
there
were
more
people
involved.
those
covenanters
were
involved
in
the
contract
too
and
they
had
a
property
right
too
and
their
so-called
property
right
was
the
right
to
insist
upon
racial
discrimination
on
the
part
of
the
buyer
and
the
seller.
and
it
was
that
that
this
court
held
could
not
be
enforced
through
the
courts
and
to
that
extent,
shelley
is
similar
to
this
and
also
the
statute
that
supposedly
was
--
statute
was
involved
in
the
shelley
speaks
of
personal
property
as
well
as
real
property
as
well.
there
was
a
question
about
the
innkeepers'
law
in
north
carolina.
the
law
of
innkeepers
in
north
carolina
state
--
in
state
against
steele
at
106,
766
--
north
carolina
766
and
racial
discrimination
is
an
exception
to
the
innkeeper's
rule.
an
innkeeper
can
keep
out
a
person
on
the
grounds
of
race
if
he
so
desires.
guests
of
a
hotel
and
travelers
or
other
persons
entering
it
with
a
bona
fide
intent
of
the
coming
guest
cannot
be
lawfully
prevented
from
going
in
or
be
put
out
by
force
and
so
from
the
so
on,
unless
they
be
persons
of
bad
or
suspicious
character
or
a
vulgar
habit
are
so
objectionable
to
the
patrons
of
the
house
on
account
of
the
race
to
which
they
belong
and
so
forth.
mr.
jack
greenberg
state
v.
steele,
106
north
carolina
766.
mr.
jack
greenberg
pardon
me?
mr.
jack
greenberg
18
--
1890
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
is
a
north
carolina
statute
and
the
north
carolina
statute
embodies
the
rule
of
state
v.
steele
which
says
that
it
shall
apply
to
persons
whom
the
innkeeper
may
accept
as
his
guest
in
his
inn
or
hotel.
and
it
is
annotated
--
that
statute
is
annotated
to
state
v.
steele
obviously
and
he
may
--
need
not
accept
persons
on
the
grounds
of
race.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there's
no
race
in
the
statute.
that's
true,
but
the
case
says
that
he
need
not
accept
negroes
as
guests.
and
we
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
for
the
reasons
we
have
given
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
there
has
been
an
arrest,
a
conviction.
the
courts
and
police
have
acted.
this
is
something
that
bites
deeper
and
harder
than
shelley
and
there
was
all
these
additional
state
action
that
we've
spoken
about
involved
in
the
cases
as
well
but
for
the
reasons
given,
these
convictions
and
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
