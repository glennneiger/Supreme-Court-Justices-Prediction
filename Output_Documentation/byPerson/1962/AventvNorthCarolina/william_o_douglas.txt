justice
william
o.
douglas
oh,
i
suppose
when
a
judge
sends
a
person
to
jail
that's
state
action.
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course
this
question
on
private
property
has
been
quite
a
long
standing
argument
in
this
court,
going
back
to
brown
versus
illinois
and
all
of
the
cases
since
then
that
i
have
a
right
to
do
with
my
property
what
i
want.
sometimes
the
answer
has
been
that
there
is
a
state
law
that
regulates
the
rates,
other
times
it's
the
state,
the
federal
constitution
prohibits
it.
i
don't
see
why
you
shy
away
from
lawful
right
up
to
this
problem
of
private
property
argument.
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
north
carolina,
could
a
negro
get
a
room
in
a
--
in
an
inn?
justice
william
o.
douglas
a
negro
get
a
room
in
an
inn?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
that
that's
--
those
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
those
are
some
wildcards
in
that
deck
you
just
dealt.[laughter]
justice
william
o.
douglas
proper
--
you
said
proper
persons
who
deport
themselves
well.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
probably
would
exclude
negroes?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
does
a
custom
goes
far
as
to
exclude
negroes
from
getting
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
your
private
property
argument
as
i
read
your
brief
would
extend
as
much
to
the
hotels
as
it
would
to
the
stores.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
is
the
distinction
between
those
common
law
enterprises
that
you
talk
about
in
a
retail
store?
i
don't
understand.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
well,
we're
--
we're
still
growing
up
and
i
assume
and
the
courts
fashion
these
rules
(inaudible)
that
you
talk
about
as
a
common
law.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
is
a
--
is
a
private
property
of
a
retail
store
more
sacrosanct
than
private
property
of
a
motel
or
a
hotel?
justice
william
o.
douglas
one
that
you
can
exclude,
in
others,
you
can't.
justice
william
o.
douglas
except
to
hotels
and
motels.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that
would
depend
on
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
come
back
then
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
justice
william
o.
douglas
we're
getting
pretty
close
to
raising
it
right
now,
aren't
we?[laughter]
justice
william
o.
douglas
your
argument
would
be
the
same
if
the
persons
excluded
were
jews.
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
those
cases
on
their
way
up
here
too?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
some
states
left
it
to
the
utilities
to
determine
how
much
they
charge,
that
was
under
the
guise
of
property
rights.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
just
inquiring,
i
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
or
putting
the
man
in
jail
is
state
action,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
know
our
decisions
under
the
restrictive
covenant
laws,
don't
you.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
don't
think
a
court
could
deny
a
person
equal
protection
of
the
laws?
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh,
maybe
that's
the
question
we
have
here.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
mean
the
desegregation
law
is
pretty
well
enforced?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
mean,
that
means
that
they
are
pretty
enforced
that's
why
you
don't
have
these
cases.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
know
some
bar
associate
--
under
some
bar
association
arrangements
with
the
judiciary,
the
judges
assign
lawyers
to
represent
people.
he
doesn't
pick
his
clients
completely.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
still
going
on
now.
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh,
we
have
many
cases
and
you
are
familiar
with
them
where
--
like
the
picketing
cases,
you
don't
need
a
statute
of
the
state.
he
relies
upon
his
constitutional
right
and
the
state
judge
puts
him
in
prison
for
doing
it,
and
we
say
that's
violating
a
--
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
it
--
as
incorporated
in
the
first
amendment,
that's
state
action.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
we've
got
the
same
question
here.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
power
enforced
of
the
constitution
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
equal
protection.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
--
i
know,
but
that's
the
issue
in
the
case
and
that's
what
we're
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
we
had
a
unanimous
decision
in
the
thornhill
case
where
we
struck
down
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
on
ambiguity.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
the
constitution
doesn't
need
legislative
implementation
to
have
force
and
effect,
does
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
but
the
--
our
case
--
our
reports
are
filled
with
decisions
where's
judicial
action
is
sufficient.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
know
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
up
to
now?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
you
could
therefore
if
you're
running
utility,
you
could
refuse
to
serve,
hook
up
negro
homes
with
your
electricity?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
isn't
that
the
basic
question?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
see
it
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
see
any
greater
invasion
of
this
sacred
property
right
you're
talking
about
in
the
--
in
this
case
and
in
the
utility
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
his
prices
have
often
being
fixed
by
government,
haven't
they?
