there's
a
hundred
--
162
convictions?
justice
potter
stewart
162
separate
prosecutions?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
--
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
the
facts,
specific
facts.
it's
true,
is
it
not,
that
the
manager,
the
record
shows
that
the
manager
called
the
police?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
after
the
police
arrived
and
in
the
presence
of
the
police,
the
manager
unambiguously
told
these
people
to
leave.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
it
was
the
police,
was
it
not,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
without
a
warrant
and
--
who
arrested
them.
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
police
and
not
by
the
manager?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
you
are
right
--
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
you
told
us
you
are
going
to
get
to
it,
but
as
of
now,
we
can
assume
that
there
was
no
reference
in
the
ren
--
during
the
trial
or
at
any
time
to
this
municipal
ordinance
of
durham?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
state
supreme
court
stated
that
there
was
no
law
requiring
segregation
in
restaurants,
did
it
not,
in
its
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
in
the
record.
alright,
thank
you,
i
just
wanted
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
so,
certainly
so
far
as
your
present
argument
goes
as
i
understand
it,
you
could
not
make
that,
this
same
argument
of
the
--
if
this
--
if
these
people
had
been
ejected
and
arrested
under
a
trespass
statute
of
say
montana
or
minnesota
or
wyoming.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
conceivable
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
montana
some
private
restaurateur
would
not
want
to
serve
colored
people.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
it's
conceivable
that
montana
like
north
carolina
has
a
trespass
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
would
not
be
able
to
make
your
present
argument
in
that
state,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
suggesting
it's
a
paradox.
i'm
just
trying
to
understand
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
true
on
almost
every
state,
isn't
it,
insofar
as
prisoners
go?
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
california
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
mistaken,
i
am
mistaken
[inaudible]
[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
prevents
any
actual
voluntary
decision
on
the
part
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
this
county
was
--
the
reason
here
i
suppose
that
you're
reluctant
to
strongly
urge
that
there
was
coercion
in
this
case
is
that
the
record
simply
doesn't
bear
out
on
any
coercion.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
talking
about
coercion
upon
kress'.
i'm
looking
now
at
page
22
of
the
record
and
all
that
it
shows
there
is
the
--
as
i
read
it,
is
the
voluntary
choice
on
the
part
of
the
management
of
kress
to
follow
the
various
local
customs
in
the
communities
in
which
they
have
their
stores,
actuated
and
motivated
by
what
they
considered
enlightened
self
interest
and
the
profit
motive.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
produce
it
the
other
way,
isn't
it?
the
custom
produces
the
law.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking
about
the
trespass
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
how
--
when
did
that
first
enacted,
mr.
moody?
justice
potter
stewart
about
100
years
old
or
so?
justice
potter
stewart
95
years
--
that's
--
is
this
same
statute,
isn't
it
that
was
involved
in
a
case
in
this
court,
wolfe
against
north
carolina.
justice
potter
stewart
in
new
york
i
think
there's
a
--
at
least
one
place
where
a
bar,
the
fillmore
bar,
where
women
are
excluded,
only
--
it's
a
men's
bar.
