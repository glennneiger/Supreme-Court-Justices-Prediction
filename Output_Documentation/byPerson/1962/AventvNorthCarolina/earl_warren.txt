chief

was
the

declared
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
take
judicial
notice
of
ordinances
of
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
say
that
the
hospital
was
segregated,
is
that
by
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there's
no
specific
state
law,
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
spoke
about
maternity
hospitals,
are
they,

require
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
municipal
hospitals.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
there's
no
law
of
segregation
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
goldberg,
you
mentioned
a
moment
ago
that
there
was
a
law
in
north
carolina
to
the
effect
that
no
negro
could
give
an
order
to
a
white
man.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
just
in
the
national
guard.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
--
it
wouldn't
help
us
a
little
as
you
suggest
[inaudible]
without
arguing
these
things
that
constitute
the
state
action
that
you
complain
of.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
being
to
the
[inaudible]
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
[inaudible]
to
that
of
course.
chief
justice
earl
warren

of
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
any
white
troops
that
have
colored
officers
in
your
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
why
do
you
say
that
the
law
is
invalid
if
it's
obeyed
to
that
extent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
can't
hear
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
might
also
read
what
general
mark
clark
said
when
he
first
came
back
to
this
country
after
fighting
with
those
people
that
he
would
happy
to
have
people
of
their
qualities
fighting
the
way
they
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
except
that
they're
raised
and
let
us
now
discuss
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.

may
finish
after

mr.
moody,

may
continue
please.

1962,
1963,
this
is
the
year
just
coming
about
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
this
year.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
--
this
year
too
mr.
moody,
the
one
you
just
read
to
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
term,
just
started.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
they
do
it
as
a
matter
of
fact,
do
you
happen
to
know
mr.
moody
--
i
don't
--
do
you
happen
to
know
if
they
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
if
a
--
a
white
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
law,
well,
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
un
--
i
understood
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
haven't
a
lot
of
these
things
developed
these
situations
that
you're
talking
about
now
developed
since
this
case
was
instituted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
do
you
certainly
--
the
schools
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
certainly
the
school
cases
were
and
certainly
before
boynton,
there
was
the
boynton
case,
they
were
down
there,
were
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
that
was
in
virginia,
was
it?
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
before
the
boynton
case,
did
you
have
a
--
did
you
permit
them
to
use
the
facilities
of
the
stations
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
moody
may
i
ask
you
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
if
any
distinction
you
make
between
these
two
hypothetical
cases
in
one
the
restaurant
owner
says,
“i
only
want
to
deal
with
whites.
i
don't
want
to
--
i
only
want
to
deal
with
whites.
i
don't
want
to
deal
with
colored
people
at
all
and
colored
people
are
not
welcome
in
my
establishment
and
if
they
come
in,
i
want
them
put
and
i'm
entitled
with
the
text
of
the
law
to
get
them
out.”
on
the
other
hand,
you
have
a
store
owner
like
who
are
worse
or
some
of
the
rest
of
these
that
we're
talking
about
where
the
colored
people
are
invited
in.
they're
invited
to
buy,
they
do
buy
and
in
one
part
of
the
store,
he
says,
“here
is
a
counter
where
you
are
prohibited
and
if
you
walk
in
there,
i
order
you
out
and
if
you
don't
i'll
have
you
arrested
and
the
law
doesn't
arrest
me.”
is
there
any
difference
between
those
situations
as
you
see
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
greenberg.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
year
was
that
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
year
was
that
in?
