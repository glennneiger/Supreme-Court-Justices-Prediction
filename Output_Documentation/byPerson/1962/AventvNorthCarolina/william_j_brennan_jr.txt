j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
wouldn't
you
say
[inaudible]
restrictions,
do
you
mean
communities?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
any
event
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
greenberg,
may
i
ask,
i'm
still
not
quite
clear.
do
you
want
us
to
give
some
significance
to
the
ordinance
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
you
don't
make
any
reference
to
the
ordinance
at
all
in
your
brief,
do
you,
in
the
collection
of
other
things?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
well,
is
this
then
i
gather
just
one
of
the
many
things
to
which
you
direct
our
attention
which
likewise
were
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
referred
to
in
the
record
below
or
in
any
of
the
proceedings
in
the
state
courts
which
you
ask
us
take
them
as
part
of
the
pattern
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
things
as
they
are
in
north
carolina?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
was
only
in
the
context.
you're
not
asking
us
--
not
arguing
are
you,
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
an
arrest
and
conviction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
understand
then
mr.
greenberg
why
you're
fencing
with
the
question
whether
there
was
something
in
the
way
of
state
coercion
whether
you
express
it
in
language
of
custom.
doesn't
your
whole
case
or
does
it
not
rest
on
the
premise
that
these
choices,
if
they're
choices
at
all
are
choices
compelled
by
some
kind
of
state
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
premise
or
not
of
your
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
must
say,
some
of
your
answers
have
confused
me
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page?
