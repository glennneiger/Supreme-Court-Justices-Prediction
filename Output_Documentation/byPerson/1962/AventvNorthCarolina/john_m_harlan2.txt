what
was
the
sentence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
many?
how
many
sit-in
cases
did
you
happen
to
know?
how
many
sit-in
cases?
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
--
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you.
how
long
is
this
durham
ordinance
been
in
the
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
[inaudible]?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
the
durham
ordinance
before
to
make
the
so-called
integrated
lunch
counter
illegal?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
said
that
the
record
is
not
clear
unless
i
misunderstood
you
as
to
who
called
the
police.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
manager
said

they
refused
to
leave,
that
is
according
to
petitioner
until
they
were
served
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
indicate
that
the
statute
[inaudible]
sometimes
in
state
courts?
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
you
don't
place
any
specific
reliance
on
the
statute
as
such
except
as
a
part
of
this
larger
[inaudible]
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
greenberg,
do
i
understand
it
correctly
that
right
now
the
services
being
made
to
everybody
at
the
sit
down
counter
and
the
ordinance
is
not
being
enforced?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
this
case
has
arisen
in
new
york
city,
you'd
be
arguing
that
there
was
an
unconstitutional
determination?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
thought
that
that
is
a
federal
constitutional
matter.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
not
arguing
in
other
words
that
there's
no
state
action
required
in
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
argument
doesn't
rest
on
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
your
argument,
if
i
understand
it,
if
you
brought
an
action
under
the
civil
rights
act
with
damages
on
this
state
of
facts
shown
on
this
record,
you
would
say
it
should
be
entitled
to
recover
them,
would
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
an
action
against
the
restaurateur
or
kress.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no.
what
i'm
just
saying
was
whether
your
thesis
doesn't
suggest
that
result.
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
but
your
thesis
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
independent,
isn't
it
of
the
arrest?
i
understand
you
don't
say
it
--
you
don't
regard
the
arrest
itself
as
constituting
the
state
action.
you
say
that
is
simply
part
and
parcel
of
this
broader
piece
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
has
no
great
bearing
on
the
issues
in
this
case,
does
it?
