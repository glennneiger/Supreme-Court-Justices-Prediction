justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
state
would
abolish
all
these
licensing
laws
and
collect
its
taxes
by
another
method,
would
that
change
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
determine
whether
the
merchant
can
choose
his
customers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
basically
get
back,
do
you
not,
always
to
the
question
whether
the
owner
of
the
store
can
choose
his
customers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
detract
from
his
right
because
the
state
has
passed
laws
which
he
may
or
may
not
be
in
favor
of
with
reference
to
segregation
in
other
fields.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
position
that
assuming
that
an
owner
does
have
a
legal
right
to
control
who
would
come
into
his
place
and
a
merchant
has
a
right
to
chose
who
would
come
into
his
place,
that
we
can't
--
that
the
state
is
powerless
to
do
anything
to
insist
him
in
enforcing
his
legal
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
have
a
case
where
the
owner
wants
them
there,
that's
quite
a
different
thing.
i
understood
you
were
arguing
a
different
case.
i
understood
you
are
arguing
on
the
assumption
that
the
owner
did
not
want
those
certain
customers
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
arguing
further
that
the
state
is
without
power
to
protect
his
right
if
he
has
one
to
choose
his
customers.
that's
the
reason
i
asked
you,
if
you
don't
always
get
back.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
answer
is.
do
you
not
always
get
back
to
the
kind
of
question,
does
a
store
owner
has
a
right
to
choose
his
customers
on
the
basis
of
color?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
a
man
has
a
right
to
do
something
deprived
of
that
right
because
the
custom
of
the
community
is
to
do
that,
that
he
can't
act
in
the
court
for
the
customs
of
the
community
to
do
that
which
he
has
a
legal
right
to
do
to,
choose
his
customers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
from
the
record,
[inaudible]
the
question
to
mean.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
they
want
to?
do
they
have
a
free
choice
to
do
as
they
please?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
the
law
has
infused
that
custom
because
that
will
be
a
lifted
viewpoint
of
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
why
do
we
have
that
concession
--
excuse
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
we
have
that
concession?
justice
hugo
l.
black
segregation
law
that's
been
part
of
this
country
unless
you
got
to
have
state
laws
of
segregation
custom,
you
have
to
have
state
laws
in
order
to
get
that
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
that
of
segregate
law,
for
segregation
in
the
south
was
abolished,
there
would
be
no
customs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
quite
a
different
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
arguing
if
the
law,
state
law
must
such
customs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
is
your
argument
based
on
that
premise?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
that
if
north
carolina
wanted
to
abandon
their
common
law
with
reference
to
inns,
they
could
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
constitution
forbids
a
state,
require
the
states
that's
why
the
--
all
hotels
to
receive
anybody
to
[inaudible]?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
your
common
law,
which
do
you
think
requires
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
is
a
public
utility,
does
the
constitution
make
it
a
public
utility
under
the
statute
being
[inaudible]?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
you
say
the
argument
that's
been
raised
in
this
court
that
a
public
utility
serves
the
public
is
that
a
constitutional
rule
that
requires
the
public
utility
to
serve
everybody
or
is
it
the
rule
of
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
that
they
can
be
regulated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
--
does
the
constitution
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
that's
state
action.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
you
admit
state
action
with
reference
to
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
reference
to
the
conviction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
claim
is
that
the
law
is
indicted
because
as
you
would
argue
the
law,
the
property
owner
has
a
right.
the
constitution
doesn't
take
away
from
him
to
choose
the
customers
that
are
coming
to
his
store
and
tell
him
what
he
wants
to
and
when
he
wants
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
the
civil
rights
act
which
were
passed
would've
protected
that
by
legislation
and
this
court
must
stricken
them
down,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
the
old
civil
rights
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
stricken
down
on
the
ground
that
the
law
couldn't
be
passed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
of
the
constitution
and
a
converse
argument
here
is
the
constitution
does
it
without
an
act.
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
application
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
wouldn't
have
much
to
do
with
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that
statute?
what
â€“
[inaudible]?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
don't
need
any
law
on
that
for
a
large
number
of
fraternal
orders,
do
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
a
case
of
that
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
--
having
them
pass
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
as
--
i
understand
the
public
interest
is,
its
like
mann.
mann
had
under
consideration
a
statute
which
is
attacked
as
unconstitutional,
fixed
prices
and
the
court
said
that
matters
that
were
fixed
for
the
public
interest,
that
was
the
words
that
were
used
there
which
have
not
been
wholly
credited
in
some
later
cases,
matters
fixed
for
the
public
interest
could
be
regulated
by
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
is
there
any
of
them
that
holds
that
the
constitution
does
the
regulating?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
your
argument
about
the
public
interest
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
how
that
would
effect
this
constitutional
interpretation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
would
be
an
intrusion
of
the
state
if
it
regulated
them
wouldn't
it,
and
that's
been
sustained.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
state
had
passed
the
law
which
says
that
the
merchant
could
not
serve
white
people
and
colored
people
together,
would
you
--
would
argue
that
that's
a
good
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
would
say
that
the
state
regulated
that
place
in
a
way
that
offends
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
correct
your
answer
with
reference
to
myself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
never
agreed
to
an
opinion
yet
that
said
that
the
constitution
forbids
the
state
to
keep
people
from
watching
around
and
around
a
place.
i
have
supported
decisions
that
said
you
can't
control
the
views
they
express,
but
i
have
not
agreed
an
opinion
knowingly
that
said
the
state
or
the
federal
government
is
without
power
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
people
marching
around
and
around
or
in
front
of
a
place.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
could
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
your
argument
better
if
you
just
keep
yourself
to
the
question,
whether
owner
of
property,
the
constitution
forbids
an
owner
of
the
property
to
select
his
customers
whether
there's
any
provision
of
the
constitution
that
even
say
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
cases
were
those
that
you
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
we
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
case
have
we
decided?
we
--
who
again
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
decided
wickard
versus
filburn
too,
didn't
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
by
court
order,
is
that
--
