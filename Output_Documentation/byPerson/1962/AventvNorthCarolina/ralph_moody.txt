mr.
ralph
moody
may
it
please
this
court.
mr.
ralph
moody
we
don't
think
this
is
primarily
a
matter
of
segregation
or
a
segregation
case.
we
have
a
general
trespass
statute
and
as
has
been
pointed
out
in
martin
against
struthers
in
which
i
think
mr.
justice
black
wrote
the
opinion,
he
appended
a
note
to
the
opinion
in
which
he
pointed
it
out
that
some
20
states
have
general
trespass
statute
and
some
12
states
have
them
in
a
more
restrictive
manner.
mr.
ralph
moody
could
do
what?
mr.
ralph
moody
our
statute
is
a
reenactment
of
the
common
law
and
that
the
innkeepers
must
take
all
proper
customers
who
deport
themselves
with.
mr.
ralph
moody
i
think
--
mr.
ralph
moody
how
was
that?
i
didn't
hear
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
what
i
meant
was
people
that
--
mr.
ralph
moody
no.
what
i
meant
was
that
a
fellow
came
in
drunk
or
something
like
that.
i
didn't
mean
that.
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
i
don't
--
i
think
about
the
custom
is,
they
just
don't
go
to
the
hotels
as
far
as
i
know
and
as
for
[laughter]
--
they
go
to
their
own
hotels.
i
don't
know
about
the
custom
and
also
--
mr.
ralph
moody
no
sir.
no,
i
don't
want
to
say
that
because
i
say
by
statute
and
by
common
law
the
innkeepers
in
our
--
in
my
state
are
bound
to
furnish
accommodations
if
they
have
it
and
also
the
same
thing
would
be
as
to
the
cabs
i
believe
and
gristmills
and
those
ancient
things
that
the
common
law
provided
that
service
had
to
be
furnished.
i
think
that
my
state
follows
those
laws.
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
i
don't
--
the
distinction
is
simply
this
that
--
those
rooms
grow
out
separate
and
apart
from
stores
and
cafes
and
restaurants.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
it
does.
well
--
but
i
have
--
i
do
not
know
of
any
rule
though
that
has
been
--
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
i
think
they're
all
private
property.
i
think
they've
got
a
lot
--
mr.
ralph
moody
i
think
a
person
and
i
think
it's
supported
by
authority
all
of
when
--
in
other
states,
northern
as
well
as
southern,
i
say
that
a
person
who
owns
property
can
exclude
people
from
interference
or
coming
on
that
property
if
he
wants
to.
mr.
ralph
moody
and
i
would
put
the
old
common
law
we've
--
where
common
law
state
“the
gristmills
and
the
cabs”.
mr.
ralph
moody
how
is
that
sir?
mr.
ralph
moody
oh,
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
--
mr.
ralph
moody
do
i
think
the
constitution
requires
that?
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
i
think
that
as
far
as
we've
been
–
the
way
we've
been
driven
by
the
common
law.
the
question
has
never
been
raised
and
--
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
sir.
we
certainly
are
but
not
with
the
hotel
or
a
motel
and
not
with
a
--
an
inn
or
a
cab.
we're
raising
it
on
a
piece
of
private
property
that
people
own
on
which
a
general
trespass
statute
that's
enforced
in
all
over
this
country
says
that
people
can
accept
such
costumers
as
they
want
and
exclude
such
costumers
and
he
has
not
cited
the
case
today
which
contravenes
that
right.
mr.
ralph
moody
no,
sir
i
can't
tell
you
one
way
or
the
other
about
it.
mr.
ralph
moody
my
idea
is
frankly
that
they
--
that
they
have
not.
as
i
said
in
a
minute
in
my
brief,
we
were
raised
and
we
were
reared
in
the
near
view
and
a
pattern
of
segregation
that
was
handed
to
us,
has
passed
it
on
to
us.
we
--
and
as
i
also
want
to
say,
we
had
legal
sanction
too.
as
you
know
from
plessy
against
ferguson
and
james
against
canada
and
in
thomas
against
the
board
of
education
and
that
line
of
cases,
we
had
some
judicial
sanction
for
the
positions
that
were
--
that
we
had
even
from
this
court.
mr.
ralph
moody
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
don't
know
of
any
case
that
i
could
point
to
or
where
any
question
has
arisen
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
that
colored
people
have
gone
to
their
own
hotels
and
have
--
if
there
had
been
any
that
wanted
for
instance
in
the
[inaudible]
that
wanted
to
go,
“sir
walter,
i
haven't
heard
about
it
in
main
hotels”.
i
just
don't
know
what
the
attitude
would
be.
i
am
saying
that
innkeepers
under
our
law,
statute
law
which
is
in
cooperation
of
common
law
and
the
--
that
there
were
some
exceptions
other
than
the
property
rule
here
that
i
am
contending
for
under
a
general
trespass
statute
which
i
say
is
a
valid
statute
and
which
i
say
does
not
segregate
or
pick
them
out
as
a
class
or
a
group
at
all.
it
doesn't
pick
them
out
as
any
class
or
group
and
it
does
not
make
any
arbitrary
classification
for
that
matter.
in
regard
to
them,
the
statute
is
--
neutrally
it
applies
to
all
people
and
if
a
person
as
we
see
it
and
as
we
enforce
it
whether
right
or
wrong,
if
people
come
to
the
land
--
on
my
land
and
i
don't
want
them
i
tell
them
to
get
off.
if
they
come
in
my
store
and
i
don't
like
them,
i
tell
them
to
get
out.
this
perhaps
like
in
the
old
days,
one
of
the
hatfields
would've
told
the
mccoys
in
one
of
the
feud
--
in
the
feuding
days,
and
as
far
as
i
know
our
statute
has
been
enforced
that
way
as
a
--
not
as
a
statute
passed
against
colored
people.
it's
almost
100
years
old.
there's
no
--
the
--
he
can't
go
back
and
generate
a
discriminatory
basis
in
history
for
the
passage
of
this
statute
at
all.
as
far
as
i
can
tell
it
didn't
arise
that
way
at
all.
and
as
you
go
up
through
the
cases,
you
only
find
these
are
the
first
ones
i
know
of
that
color
--
the
colored
people,
i
think
this
is
sponsored
organization
by
--
he
says
it's
informal.
but
they
said
they
had
a
slogan
that
mr.
m.
l.
king
had
furnished
them
and
i
think
it's
a
[inaudible]
is
alright,
i'm
not
going
to
raise
any
point
about
that.
but
this
statute
--
they
cannot
--
any
case
be
made
that
this
statute
has
been
administered,
singled
out
--
colored
people
have
been
singled
out
and
it's
been
administered
against
them.
it
has
not.
mr.
ralph
moody
the
trespass
statute
is
--
mr.
ralph
moody
about
18
--
mr.
ralph
moody
yes,
it's
96
i
believe
to
be
exact.
i
can
get
that
i
think
for
you
in
a
minute.
mr.
ralph
moody
wolfe
against
north
carolina
was
here,
the
same
statute
in
wolfe
against
north
carolina
was
here,
has
some
aspects
like
the
statute
in
marsh
against
alabama
and
of
that
nature.
and
--
mr.
ralph
moody
yes,
redheaded
people
or
myself
or
anybody
else.
i
say
that
if
the
man
owns
the
property
and
he
has
the
right
to
decide
who
comes
on
his
property,
i
say
he
excludes
anybody
he
wants
to
and
for
whatever
whim,
caprice
or
anything
else.
if
its
--
his
brother
was
killed
by
a
redheaded
man,
he
don't
like
redheaded
people,
excludes
them
from
that
or
any
other
reasons.
it's
his
property
and
i
say
that
he
puts
--
he
arrogates
property
to
just
a
merely
bundle
of
rights
and
maybe
it
is.
but
i
say
that's
one
right
that
hasn't
destroyed
and
it's
a
right
i
say
ought
to
be
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
if
we're
going
to
keep
property
in
this
country.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes,
i
think
the
--
i
believe
that's
down
in
--
in
the
basement
of
that
store
or
hotel,
never
have
been
there.[laughter]
mr.
ralph
moody
no
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
i
do
not.
they're
--
still
they
are
--
mr.
ralph
moody
no.
i
think
--
i
don't
mean
to
--
i
think
the
--
it's
too
late
to
say
the
statutes
--
civil
right
statutes
enacted
in
the
police
power
of
the
states
has
presented,
i
think
they
are.
but
north
carolina
has
chosen
to
leave
this
an
open
question
and
it
has
chosen
to
let
people
do
as
they
please.
now,
mr.
greenberg
i
think
has
done
some
testifying
in
this
case
and
i'd
like
to
testify
too.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
where
i
live
in
rowley
colored
people
are
going
--
go
into
the
lunch
counter
at
wofes,
that's
a
nice
food
chain,
they
go
into
the
lunch
counter
at
wofes,
that's
a
nice
food
chain.
they're
eating
in
there.
they
go
into
the
lunch
counter
at
mcclelland's.
mr.
ralph
moody
no
sir.
[laughter]
those
are
not
cases
your
honor.
no.
i
--
the
--
as
--
but
i
say
as
a
matter
of
fact
my
point
was
north
carolina
leaves
it
to
the
choice
of
the
people
who
operate
the
establishment
and
these
people
chose
to
accept
colored
people
and
they
are
doing
so.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
sir,
that's
true,
but
if
it
is
your
honor's
position
that
a
restaurant
is
a
public
utility
then
i
mean
--
mr.
ralph
moody
no.
what
statute?
you
mean
this?
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
i
[inaudible]
rule
now,
i
think
in
all
--
in
view
of
all
of
these
cases
where
--
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
if
i
understood
the
questions
on
all
those
line
of
cases
like
morgan
against
west
virginia
and
the
bowman
case
in
alabama
and
all
those,
those
were
public
utilities
and
it
was
--
it
was
a
valid
constitutional
right
to
be
segregating
in
the
seating
part
of
the
--
on
the
buses.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes,
it
is
and
we've
--
they've
been
indicted.
their
strings
have
--
been
indicted
and
put
in
jail
on
this
very
statute
at
both
times
and
both
colors,
and
in
fact
we
invoked
it
in
favor
of
as
i
pointed
out
to
you
in
my
brief
in
state
against
hills,
we
invoked
it
in
favor
of
the
kindred
statute,
the
forcible
trespass
which
is
a
much
sterner
--
a
much
more
aggravated
offense,
we
invoked
it
for
a
colored
woman
where
a
group
of
white
people
went
in,
cut
all
of
their
timber
that
white
people
were
convicted
in
the
supreme
court
of
–-
mr.
ralph
moody
i
do.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
i
say
that's
--
mr.
ralph
moody
and
i
say
that's
the
basic
question.
this,
the
mccloud
issue
trying
to
make
a
segregation
question
--
a
case
out
of
here
just
because
these
defendants
happened
to
be
colored
people.
mr.
ralph
moody
the
--
i
don't
know.
do
you
mean
the
old
civil
rights
act?
mr.
ralph
moody
in
the
civil
rights
cases,
it
would
have
protected
them
in
theaters
and
things
of
that
nature.
i
don't
believe
that
they
raised
the
question
there
about
food
or
--
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
the
converse
argument
is
that
the
constitution
does
it
without
an
act
in
the
--
yes.
i
think
he's
saying
of
course
now,
mr.
greenberg
is
hunting
for
state
action.
he's
hunting
for
a
state
action
hook
to
hang
on
here
and
he
goes
back
to
our
customs
and
he
says
our
customs
are
the
--
dogmatically
the
equivalent
of
state
action
by
a
sort
of
a
process
of
verbal
transubstantiation
that
goes
into
state
action
and
if
that
was
true
--
mr.
ralph
moody
i
do
sir,
but
i
know
that
you
had
a
statute
in
that
though
that
a
valid
federal
statute
that
said
that
colored
people
had
the
right
to
acquire
property
in
all
respects
and
never
as
white
people
did
and
the
shelley
case
as
i
read
it
to
a
large
extent
hangs
on
that
valid
statute.
mr.
ralph
moody
i
don't
--
i
think
a
court
could,
yes.
mr.
ralph
moody
no,
i
think
the
court
can,
but
that
--
they
were
--
in
the
shelley
case,
in
the
first
place,
the
people
there
were
in
agreement.
they
were
in
agreement
there,
that
were
the
--
the
colored
people
and
the
white
people
both
in
--
i
believe
they've
executed
the
deeds
and
they
were
all
in
agreement
there
in
the
shelley
case
and
furthermore
that's
buttressed
by
this
statute
that
gives
them
the
right,
the
same
as
anyone
else
to
negotiate
and
acquire
property.
now,
of
course
the
argument
was
made
well,
you
can
do
that
for
a
--
the
white
for
whom
--
do
the
same
thing
or
deny
it
on
for
white
people.
and
this
court
said
no
you
can't
have
equality
of
discrimination
because
if
it's
bad
on
one,
of
course
it
would
be
bad
on
the
other.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes,
i
want
to
--
i'm
glad
that
you
got
my
mind
on
that
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
want
to
go
into
that
just
a
minute
if
you
will
allow
me
to
do
so
here.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes.
mr.
ralph
moody
i
will.
yes,
i
will.
mr.
ralph
moody
there
is
an
old
statute
on
the
national
guard
that
you
can
have
colored
troops,
but
they
will
be
--
they
must
be
commanded
by
white
officers,
that's
there.
in
view
of
your
later
line
of
decisions,
i
don't
think
the
statute
is
valid.
but
as
you
know,
these
statutes
were
--
lurk
on
books
until
some
commission
comes
along,
statutes
commission
and
takes
them
out.
actually,
we'd
go
in
process
of
that
matter.
mr.
ralph
moody
the
ordinance
of
the
city
of
durham
as
far
as
i
know
is
in
this
shape
that
it
was
never
enforced.
the
city
attorney
tells
me
that
they
are
revising
their
ordinances
and
that
that
one
is
marked
on
the
margin
repeals.
now
whether
they
passed
a
resolution
repealing
it
or
not,
i
don't
know
because
i
want
to
be
candid
about
it.
mr.
ralph
moody
no,
that
--
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
of
course
i
say
this
isn't
in
this
case
at
all.
it's
not
in
the
state
record.
i
thought
that
when
a
state
was
brought
to
this
board
in
answer
for
its
misdeeds
that
it
will
have
to
be
on
the
record.
it
was
there.
they
could
have
--
in
making
all
these
pattern
of
segregation.
i
have
no
judgment
--
judicial
notice
of
our
laws
we've
got
on
the
statute
books.
but
he's
gone
in
to
ordinances
and
he's
going
--
he
is
charging
me
with
the
ordinance
that
charlotte
have
down
there
in
which
it
said
we
have
some
colored
policeman
down
there
and
they
fix
some
bounds
where
--
in
which
they
would
work.
well,
that
was
nothing
in
the
world
but
police
administration.
race
and
racial
differences
are
a
fact
whether
we
like
them
or
not.
you
can
ask
the
[inaudible]
and
the
flemish
about
that
in
this
last
right
in
belgium.
and
for
instance
i
used
to
live
in
san
antonio,
texas
and
i
know
that
to
some
extent
the
mexican
policemen
that
they
have
there
had
some
bounds
and
limits
as
to
where
they
would
operate.
now,
these
were
good
police
administration
here.
we're
charged
--
i'm
brought
here
on
that
ordinance
in
charlotte
because
i
don't
even
know
anything
about
it.
but
mr.
goldberg
is
getting
back
to
the
laws,
i
mean
does
that
--
mr.
ralph
moody
there
is
the
--
there
is
that
factor
about
the
national
guard.
i
don't
think
statute
is
valid.
of
course
if
you
want
to
go
into
the
civil
rights,
in
the
civil
rights
reports,
i
wouldn't
strike
the
bad
ones
although
[inaudible]
because
i
will
find
this
is
much
an
offer,
the
mason,
dixon
line
as
he'll
find
in
the
south.
but
--
incidentally,
if
the
last,
at
this
report,
civil
rights
report,
the
district
national
guard
here
hasn't
been
desegregated
here.
mr.
ralph
moody
we
do
not
at
all.
mr.
ralph
moody
we
don't.
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
we
--
under
the
latest
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
trend
of
those
decisions
that
we
can
setup
a
national
guard
that
would
be
separate,
that
would
have
separate
troops,
colored
troops
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
moody
i
am
sorry.
i
don't
think
we
can
setup
a
national
guard
now
that
would
separate
troops.
mr.
ralph
moody
never
had
any
test
case.
if
that's
--
very
few
they
were
applied
and
want
to
go
into
the
national
guard.
now,
with
all
due
respect
to
these
people,
soldiering
is
not
their
great
point
if
we
include
that
by
general
mark
clark's
book
on
calculated
risk
about
the
campaign
in
italy
and
what
happened
to
the
92nd
negro
division.
mr.
ralph
moody
no
sir,
it
wouldn't
but
the
soldiering
is
not
their
point.[laughter]
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
i
read
a
different
passage
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
ralph
moody
well
--
mr.
ralph
moody
yes,
some
other
book.
mr.
ralph
moody
oh,
that's
some
--
mr.
ralph
moody
yes,
i
am,
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
i've
been
there
a
little
--
some
15
or
18
years.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
sir
i
do.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
no
sir.
we
haven't
had
many
others.
so
very
many
of
the
case
is
now
--
that
--
you're
taking
to
within
that
scope,
the
school
cases
and
of
themes
of
that
nature.
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
moody
the
segregation
laws
pretty
well
enforced?
mr.
ralph
moody
no,
it's
a
--
the
case
is
there.
there
cases
being
brought
all
the
time.
there
are
cases
but
the
state
has
gradually
assigning
pupils.
now,
he
had
the
civil
rights
report
about
the
assignment
to
pupils
that
we
never
voluntarily
assign
them
any
pupils.
well
of
course,
i
don't
know
when
that
civil
rights
report
was
collected.
but
we
do
assign
them
and
i
have
the
list
and
the
tabulations
of
them
here.
for
instance,
in
shuttleworth
50
were
assigned.
50
negro
pupils
were
assigned
to
predominantly
white
schools
and
26
white
pupils
were
assigned
to
predominant
negro
schools.
mr.
ralph
moody
all
they've
said
is
a
--
in
view
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
its
other
--
utterly
invalid
and
that
this
court's
--
mr.
ralph
moody
no
except
to
the
hospitals.
now
he
mentioned
the
hospitals.
the
state
hospitals
and
they
brought
a
suit
having
a
little
boy
made
it.
the
hospital
had
told
them
repeatedly
that
he
had
to
be
on
the
waiting
list
and
they
didn't
believe
that
and
so
they
brought
a
suit
to
having
him
admitted
to
murdock
school
which
is
a
part
of
the
little
boy
--
sort
of
negro
--
colored
boy
suffering
from
schizophrenia
or
something
of
that
nature.
i
shouldn't
made
it
that
he
was
entitled
to
be
admitted
to
the
hospital.
mr.
ralph
moody
before
i
get
onto
the
question
of
mr.
justice
clark
about
the
school
situation,
i'd
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
manager
didn't
give
the
--
being
the
customer
of
the
company
was
not
the
only
reason
he
gave
for
not
wanting
colored
people
to
come
(inaudible)
in
fact
to
the
luncheonette.
he
gave
the
custom
rule
that
mr.
greenberg
has
talked
about,
if
you
refer
to
20
--
page
22
of
the
record,
he
also
said
--
mr.
ralph
moody
page
22.
he
also
said
this,
“in
the
interest
of
public
safety,
it
is
our
policy
--
mr.
ralph
moody
record
22.
in
the
interest
of
public
safety,
it
is
our
policy
to
refuse
to
serve
negroes
at
the
luncheonette
downstairs
in
our
seating
arrangement
and
he
also
said
it
is
the
policy
of
kress
to
refuse
patronage
of
white
people
in
the
company
of
negroes
at
that
counter.
and
as
you
know
they
had
a
place
to
eat,
the
stand
up
counter.
now,
you
--
we
--
i
was
wondering
--
left
off,
i
was
talking
about
schools
in
mr.
greenberg's
charge
that
under
the
civil
rights
court
we'd
never
admitted
any
voluntarily.
well
now,
this
is
not
--
may
not
be
a
great
number,
but
this
is
true
as
a
matter
of
record.
19
non-white
students
were
--
in
western
salem
were
assigned
to
predominantly
white
schools,
1962-63
school
year
without
a
court
order.
in
rowley,
47
have
been
assigned
without
a
court
order.
mr.
ralph
moody
that's
right
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
sir.
in
charlotte,
50
have
been
assigned
to
predominantly
white
schools.
26
white
pupils
assigned
predominantly
in
negro
schools.
assignments
made
initially
by
the
board.
no
assignments
made
as
a
result
of
court
order.
now,
when
you
get
to
durham,
there
were
assignments
made
there
and
i
believe
i
gave
you
that.
mr.
ralph
moody
the
42
students
are
brought
to
attend
in
durham.
i
think
that's
this
year.
let
me
see
if
i
can
find
your
honor
where
it
is
--
give
the
date.
it
was
1962-1963
school
year.
mr.
ralph
moody
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
moody
that's
right
and
of
course
mr.
greenberg's
civil
rights
committee
didn't
have
--
wouldn't
have
had
that
--
of
that
report.
now,
judge
stanley
in
the
district
court
found
in
the
durham
case,
he
found
this.
in
his
opinion,
he
said
it
should
again
be
emphasized
we're
not
dealing
with
the
situation
where
a
school
board
has
a
fixed
policy
of
maintaining
a
totally
segregated
school
system.
a
dependent
board
has
assigned
negro
children
to
durham
high
school,
broaden
junior
school,
collar
junior
high
and
he
gives
a
list
of
schools
which
i
not
take
up
the
time.
now
he
finds
that
in
his
order.
so
as
mr.
justice
clark
they
--
there
are
some
suits
pending
in
local
units.
there
are
no
suits
pending
at
the
state
level
and
you
mentioned
by
being
in
the
attorney
general's
office.
i
looked
after
those
at
the
state
level.
after
several
suits
at
the
state
level,
no
more
room.
now,
let
me
answer
some
of
these
charges.
i've
already
dealt
with
segregation
in
mental
institutions
and
told
you
that
we
admitted
they
were
entitled
to
go
in
a
lawsuit.
as
to
the
cemeteries,
i
know
of
no
law
that
segregates
as
to
the
cemeteries.
he
cites
a
statute
before
a
municipality
to
cover
cemetery,
if
they
were
predominantly
white
people
in
it,
they'd
follow
that,
predominantly
colored,
they'd
find
--
they
would
follow
that.
and
the
statute
he
cites
however
to
maintain
his
proposition,
he
doesn't
bear
that
out
because
the
statute
he
cites
if
you
look
at
it
has
simply
provided
that
where
prisoners
died
in
the
penal
institutions
and
their
bodies
were
not
claimed,
the
bodies
of
the
colored
prisoners
would
be
turned
over
to
the
colored
funeral
homes
and
the
bodies
of
the
white
to
the
white
funeral
homes.
i
know
of
no
reason
in
the
world
legal
or
otherwise
why
a
colored
person
cannot
obtain
these
services.
i
see
--
i
found
maybe
he
has
but
i
found
no
prohibition
why
colored
persons
can't
obtain
the
services
of
a
white
funeral
home
director
and
vice
versa.
now
he
should
--
mr.
ralph
moody
if
they
do
that?
mr.
ralph
moody
no
sir,
i
don't
know
of
any
case
that
it's
been
done
but
i
see
no
--
there's
no
state
action
--
mr.
ralph
moody
--
that
would
prevent
it
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
so
what
--
that's
the
impression
i
intend
to
convey
to
you.
mr.
ralph
moody
now,
let's
take
the
segregation
in
the
--
as
to
the
toilet
facilities
in
private
employment
and
the
board
of
health
requires
a
report
on
that
in
rating
the
cafes
too.
well,
one
reason
we
have
that
frankly
is
this
--
simply
is
a
fair
their
rate
is
higher
than
ours.
and
i
can't
get
around
the
facts.
as
to
separation
of
races
in
front
--
in
fraternal
orders,
i
don't
know
anything
about
that
at
all
whether
that
is
based
on
mortality
tables
and
longevity
or
anything
like
that,
i
don't
--
i
know
anything
--
i
don't
know
anything
about
that
statute
or
what
--
or
any
enforcement
of
--
mr.
ralph
moody
it
provides
that
fraternal
orders
have
to
be
--
that
fraternal
order
can't
operate
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
if
it
takes
both
races
into
the
fraternal.
mr.
ralph
moody
i
wouldn't
think
so.
we
still
have
the
constitutional
provision
that
stand
to
racial
marriages.
mr.
ralph
moody
no
sir.
that's
not
in
--
mr.
ralph
moody
how
is
that
sir?
mr.
ralph
moody
yes.
all
i
get
(inaudible)
--
they
--
they've
been
all
been
tested
out.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
true
picture
of
this
whole
thing
is
these
are
lingering
along
in
the
statutes.
they
will
be
taken
out
of
the
general
statutes
commission.
and
he
has
presented
a
picture
here
that
as
a
matter
of
practical
operation
and
light
doesn't
exist.
for
instance
he
--
he's
got
us
charged
here
with
laws
about
the
waiting
rooms,
in
the
bus
stations,
and
the
railroads.
well,
those
laws
may
still
be
there.
they've
got
to
come
out,
but
as
a
matter
of
practice,
there's
no
segregation
that
i
know
of
in
north
carolina
on
waiting
rooms
at
all.
i
ride
the
buses
and
i
see
them.
i
walk
by
the
bus
station
every
morning
to
work
and
i
see
colored
people
in
there
with
the
white
people
in
the
waiting
room
and
here
are
some
lawyers
from
durham
and
they
know
that
it's
true
up
there
too.
i've
got
the
letter
of
the
trailway
executive
vice
president,
and
he
says
they
have
obeyed
the
order
ever
since
it
was
issued
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
i
ride
the
buses
and
i
defy
them
to
prove
it
if
that
--
there
is
any
seating
arrangement
that
relates
to
race
on
the
bus
because
everybody
rides
where
they
want
to
and
where
they
can
get
a
seat
and
sit
down.
mr.
ralph
moody
no,
i
don't
think
the
--
mr.
ralph
moody
no
i
don't
think
so
--
mr.
ralph
moody
boynton
against
virginia?
mr.
ralph
moody
yes,
boynton.
mr.
ralph
moody
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
what
we
did
was
that
when
the
interstate
commerce
commission
issued
its
order
we
obeyed
it.
we
had
separate
waiting
rooms
and
we've
got
them
both
open
today
and
today
a
large
fraction
of
colored
people
prefer
to
go
over
into
other
waiting
room
where
they
used
to
go
and
talk
and
deal
when
their
served.
the
others
who
want
to
go
into
white
waiting
room
can
do
so.
and
they
know
that
and
that's
so.
mr.
ralph
moody
no
sir.
i
don't
contend
that
at
all.
i
think
some
segregation
is
practiced
in
north
carolina.
these
books
here
tell
me
its
practice
in
michigan
and
in
new
york
and
cairo,
illinois
and
all
those
places.
i've
--
mr.
justice
goldberg,
racial
antiquities
and
racial
interconnections
are
a
fact,
whether
they
square
up
with
idealistic
provisions
of
concepts
of
law
or
this
that
and
the
other
it's
the
fact.
mr.
ralph
moody
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
moody
that's
right,
exactly.
they've
been
[inaudible]
and
had
it
on
--
if
you
will,
the
--
another
implication
comes
from
your
statement
and
if
you
wish
me
to
say
so,
i'll
say
it.
probably
it
wouldn't
have
been
eliminated
at
all
because
that
hadn't
been
the
law
because
we
have
that
way
of
life
and
we
practice
that
way
of
life
and
it
was
the
thing
we
were
born
into
and
it
is
the
thing
we
did
just
as
many
other
groups
religiously
or
otherwise
are
born
into
that
thing
that
they
practice
in
to.
i
am
--
before
closing
of
this
amount
of
time,
i
wish
to
deal
just
a
minute
with
the
question
that
a
restaurant
as
a
matter
affected
with
the
public
interest.
now
i
don't
know
what
the
--
if
a
restaurant
is
affected
with
a
public
interest
just
to
this
particular
reason
or
not,
i
do
say
that
under
your
decisions
which
i
have
quoted
copiously
in
my
brief,
the
ordinary
occupations
in
economic
life
from
new
state
ice
company
against
liebmann,
standard
oil
company
will
effect
and
in
the
terminal
taxi
cabs
and
all
those,
this
is
not
a
public
facility
that
you've
been
dealing
with
and
according
to
the
definations
that
you've
been
given
which
have
been
exclusively
devoted
to
public
service
and
necessarily
it
would
not
be
because
those
have
--
most
of
those
have
a
monopoly.
this
thing
about
restaurants
and
cafes
is
a
thing
that
rises
and
falls
in
the
flux
of
economic
life.
some
institutions
grow
up
and
establish
chains
and
new
forms
of
furnishing
food
come
in
and
drive
the
others
out.
and
i
--
to
me
it's
not
of
any
--
well,
a
permanent,
enough
economic
nature
to
be
affected
with
the
public
interest.
and
if
it
is
may
i
--
would
not
the
doctor
with
his
office
soaking
out
on
the
street,
wouldn't
he
be
affected
with
the
public
interest?
would
not
the
lawyer
be
affected
with
the
public
interest?
he
deals
with
the
public
also.
would
he
choose
--
have
no
right
to
choose
his
clients.
would
a
southern
family
that
has
an
extra
room
and
rents
out
one
or
two?
mr.
ralph
moody
were
you
speaking
of
the
indigent
--
mr.
ralph
moody
--
cases?
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
yes
of
course.
i
think
mr.
justice
arthur
vanderbilt
did
that
in
new
jersey.
mr.
ralph
moody
all
the
time.
he
carried
them
by
alphabetical
order
on
down
the
line.
but
i
--
to
me
though
lawyers
and
officers
of
the
court
ought
to
do
what
the
judge
says
along
those
lines.
in
fact
he
[inaudible]
--
he
better.
[inaudible]
anymore
about
that
but
if
it
is
a
public
facility
and
if
they
can
come
in,
constitutionally
have
to
come
in,
what
are
the
goods
in
there?
does
--
how
--
is
the
man's
right
to
[inaudible]
--
there
is
goods
as
a
man's
right
to
charge
for
the
goods
taken
away
also?
it
--
do
we
--
mr.
ralph
moody
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
moody
does
the
--
mr.
ralph
moody
well
--
mr.
ralph
moody
well
i
am
saying
this
--
i
think
this
and
i
have
been
obscure
about
that
but
here's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
across.
he
is
arguing
in
his
brief
that
these
restaurants
and
cafes
and
these
sandwich
shops
and
everything
in
a
certain
sense
or
impressed
this
instrumentalities
of
the
government,
they
are
affected
with
the
public
interest
and
therefore,
if
that's
true,
there
is
the
intrusion
of
the
state
into
it
when
you
get
there.
and
--
mr.
ralph
moody
that's
right
sir.
but
he's
saying
that
when
this
--
when
--
that
these
are
public
--
that
are
affected
with
the
public
interest
and
therefore
the
state
is
--
intruded
into
it
and
it
becomes
a
state
action
and
in
line
of
cases
that
you
have
developed
here
say
that
nobody
can
be
excluded
from
things,
where
the
area,
where
the
state
comes
into.
he's
bringing
the
state
in
by
the
theory
of
a
public
interest.
mr.
ralph
moody
no.
not
if
the
state
makes
the
division.
mr.
ralph
moody
i
would
say
that
if
you
hold
that
a
café
is
a
business
affected
with
the
public
interest
that
that
thereby
subjects
it
to
--
into
state
control
and
the
--
puts
it
in
an
area
where
the
state
is
and
there
could
be
no
discrimination.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
it
is.
and
there's
state
action
--
mr.
ralph
moody
it
is
but
what
right
will
--
mr.
ralph
moody
what
is
the
countervailing
mr.
justice
douglas?
first,
let's
still
ask
--
let's
us
go
back
to
marsh
against
alabama.
there
was
a
trespass
statute
there
but
you
said
the
countervailing
right
as
to
religion
and
freedom
of
speech
foreclosed
the
prosecution
under
the
trespass
statute.
what
is
his
countervailing
right
here?
mr.
ralph
moody
it's
never
been
established
before
that
equal
protection
--
mr.
ralph
moody
--
requires
that
he
can
go
into
any
place
he
wants
to
or
any
café.
mr.
ralph
moody
it
has
nothing
--
i
know,
that's
what
we're
here
for.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
and
so
i
--
and
that
is
--
mr.
ralph
moody
yes,
but
in
kovacs
against
copper
and
--
mr.
ralph
moody
giboney
against
empire,
in
all
those,
you
said
that
free
speech
couldn't
be
a
cloak
that
--
to
--
mr.
ralph
moody
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
direct
--
it's
directed
that
state
action
that
--
i
mean
that's
sine
qua
non,
isn't
it?
mr.
ralph
moody
yes.
but
what
you're
dealing
mr.
justice
douglas
was
statutes
in
those
cases.
you
were
dealing
with
state
action
in
statutes
too.
mr.
ralph
moody
there
are
no
statutes
here.
mr.
ralph
moody
i
know
of
no
provision
that
it
--
that
has
nullified
that
right.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
sir.
unless
you
do
it
now.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
no
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
if
a
man
who
owns
property
can
admit
to
it
under
my
theory
and
under
the
theory
or
--
of
property
rights
that
i'm
trying
to
hold
to
--
mr.
ralph
moody
--
he
could
meet
partially
all,
none
or
any
part
he
can
reserve
to
himself
with,
the
right
to
use
and
enjoy
his
own
property.
mr.
ralph
moody
no
sir,
but
i'm
not
conceding
mr.
justice
douglas
that
a
café
is
a
utility.
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
i
think
it
is.
i
understand
that
in
the
garner
case
and
the
concurring
opinion
--
mr.
ralph
moody
--
you
take
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
it's
--
the
--
my
only
view
is
that
it's
a
part
of
a
facet
of
economic
life
and
its
--
comes
and
goes
it's
not
a
public
utility.
i
think
[inaudible]
man
that
operated
any
little
hamburger
shop
would
be
greatly
surprised
to
know
that
he
was
in
a
--
operating
a
public
utility
and
--
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
sir.
they've
been
fixed
by
a
government
but
they
have
been
fixed
in
stores
except
for
the
fair
trade
acts
where
patented
and
proprietary
things
were
concerned.
mr.
ralph
moody
no,
that's
certain.
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
i
--
yes
sir.
i
--
mr.
ralph
moody
i
don't
--
you
mean
by
state
statute?
mr.
ralph
moody
well,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
ralph
moody
i
don't
think
so.
they
--
states
did
that
in
these
cases
in
my
brief
in
the
ice
company
and
standard
oil
and
all
those,
and
you
gentlemen
said,
“well,
this
--
because
you
(inaudible)
--
the
state
calls
it
that
--
doesn't
mean
it
is.
we
decide
independently
whether
it
is
or
not.”
mr.
ralph
moody
those
are
the
--
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
oh,
i'd
--
i
when
i
say
you,
i
mean
the
whole
court
and
its
whole
--
back
of
it
and
everything.
i
didn't
--
i
don't
say
you
decided
that
at
this
present
court.
mr.
ralph
moody
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
it
is
sir.
mr.
ralph
moody
ordinances
that
have
not
been
changed.
ordinances
have
--
mr.
ralph
moody
they
introduced
it
in
evidence.
mr.
ralph
moody
[inaudible]
mr.
ralph
moody
they
introduced
it
in
evidence
and
make
it
a
part
of
the
record.
now,
just
why
they
take
that
view
and
what
their
motives
are,
judicial
motives
are,
i
don't
know.
that
is
the
fact
and
mr.
greenberg
had
said
so
himself.
