that
he
was
relying
on
custom.
he
had
been
asserting
his
property
right.
he
might
have
said,
“i'll
serve
a
negro”.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
really
arguing
another
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
--
how
long
did
the
state
permitted
him
to
--
they
pressed
to
have
it
--
to
serves
negroes
at
all
the
counters
in
the
store?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
long
did
--
had
it
always
been
true
that
the
state
had
permitted
him
to
serve
all
customers
at
all
counters
in
the
store
except
in
lunch
counters?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it
never
had
been
the
custom
where
the
community
practiced
to
exclude
negroes
from
an
establishment
like
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
lot
of
community
custom
do
not
segregate
and
a
lot
of
community
customs
do
segregate.
you
say
they
were
segregated
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave.
in
certain
respects
they
were,
in
certain
respects
they
were
not,
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
not
segregated
in
buying
food.
they
weren't
--
to
take
home
and
cook.
they
weren't
segregated
in
buying
anything
in
kress.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
now
in
this
case,
kress
said
that
his
property
right
had
been
--
in
effect
that
his
property
right
had
been
infringed
by
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
he
was
following
customs,
community
customs.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
to
say
that
the
--
that
you
--
you
say
that
the
company
here,
this
manager
or
--
and
the
company
were
exercising
a
free
choice
of
following
or
not
a
local
custom
and
at
some
places
they
did
and
in
some
--
whatever
the
custom
was
they
followed
it.
you're
saying
this
is
--
this
is
what
they
freely
chose
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
coerced
into
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
though
that
--
you
are
saying
though
that
the
company
felt
that
it
was
not
free
to
exercise
its
private
property
right
to
choose
among
its
customers.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you
feel
that
they
--
that
they
felt
they
had
to
do
it,
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no,
that
isn't
the
same
answer
you
just
said,
on
the
factor
that
state
action
from
beginning
to
end
doesn't
answer
justice
brennan's
question.
this
question
was
in
view
of
--
you
think
that
the
state
action
was
coercive
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
does
that
follow?
they
wouldn't
have
followed
enough
because
they
had
to.
[inaudible]
to
say
they
followed
because
they
wanted
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
because
they
want
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
the
[inaudible]
in
its
totality
of
circumstances,
persuasion
by
the
state,
participation
by
the
