mr.
john
horace
little
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
believe
mr.
jones
said
that
section
71
would
seem
--
of
the
tax
law
would
seem
to
imply
that
there
was
a
first
all
liability
under
new
york
law
for
real
estate
taxes
but
i
can
say
categorically
that
there
is
no
such
liability.
the
real
property
taxes
are
never
collected
from
any
individual.
they
are
levied
on
the
land
as
such.
that
has
been
the
law
for
the
35
years
that
i
have
practiced.
in
answer
to
mr.
brennan's
--
justice
brennan's
question
about
whether
the
court
of
appeals
had
ever
interpreted
the
sections
involved,
yes
they
have
in
the
case
cited
in
my
brief,
wesselman
against
angle,
which
i
will
mention
later
in
the
argument.
mr.
john
horace
little
wesselman
against
angle.
mr.
john
horace
little
i
have
said
that
--
mr.
john
horace
little
mr.
jones
had
said
that
section
71
of
the
new
york
tax
law
would
seem
to
imply
that
there
was
a
personal
liability.
i
know
of
no
such
personal
liability.
it's
a
new
york
real
property
tax
has
always
assessed
against
the
land
and
i
have
never
known
of
any
time
when
they
sought
to
collect
it
from
the
landowner.
mr.
john
horace
little
but
if
he
didn't
pay
it,
they
couldn't
sue
him
for
it.
mr.
john
horace
little
no
sir.
mr.
john
horace
little
that
is
correct.
they
would
foreclose
their
tax
lien
and
there
would
be
no
deficiency
against
the
taxpayer
owner.
first
of
all,
may
i
point
out
the
essential
difference
that
this
court
in
the
number
of
decisions
as
shown
to
be
between
a
federal
tax
lien
and
a
real
property
tax.
and
that
the
federal
tax
lien
attaches
only
to
the
interest
of
the
taxpayer
owner
in
whatever
property
is
the
lien
against
while
the
real
property
tax
is
a
lien
against
the
home
of
the
real
property
including
the
interest
of
the
owner
and
the
mortgagee,
any
judgment
creditor,
anyone
who
claims
any
interest
in
the
property
would
be
subject
to
the
real
property
tax.
the
respondent
believes
that
this
decision
on
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
should
be
sustained
for
several
reasons.
the
first
one
is
that
when
the
federal
tax
lien
attached
to
the
mortgagor's
interest
in
the
real
property,
it
attach
subject
to
the
right
in
the
mortgagee
to
have
the
real
property
taxes
paid
from
the
proceeds
of
the
foreclosure
sale.
in
this
case,
our
mortgage
provides
as
all
new
york
mortgages
do
that
in
case
of
a
default,
the
mortgagee
was
entitled
to
sell
the
mortgage
premises
according
to
law.
that
is
a
contract
right
and
the
law
mentioned
is
as
much
apart
of
the
mortgage
terms
as
ordered
--
it
was
set
forth
in
full
therein.
and
that
law
is
at
--
found
in
sections
1082
and
1087
of
the
new
york
civil
practice
act.
1082
says
that
when
a
plaintiff
becomes
entitled
to
a
final
judgment
in
a
foreclosure
action,
it
must
direct
the
sale
of
the
mortgage
premises
or
so
much
thereof
as
is
needed
to
discharge
the
mortgage
debt,
the
expenses
of
the
sale
and
the
cause
of
the
action.
and
section
1087
of
the
civil
practice
act
directs
the
referee
appointed
to
sell
the
mortgage
property
unless
the
judgment
otherwise
provides
to
pay
the
taxes
as
an
expense
of
the
sale.
all
of
the
taxes
and
assessments
which
--
let
me
state
that
more
clearly.
the
judgment
directs
the
referee
appointed
to
sell.
to
pay
out
of
the
proceeds
of
the
sale,
all
taxes
and
assessments
and
water
rents
which
are
liens
on
the
property
and
says
that
the
sum
--
the
sums
necessary
to
make
these
payments
are
expenses
of
the
sale
with
the
--
within
the
meaning
of
the
term
as
used
in
any
part
of
that
section.
these
statutes
have
been
a
part
of
the
law
of
new
york
since
1880
and
they
are
a
property
right
in
the
mortgagee.
when
the
mortgagor
executed
his
mortgage,
he
reduced
his
ownership
rights
in
the
property.
and
the
federal
lien
attached
only
to
his
reduced
ownership.
this
reduction
in
his
ownership
rights
came
from
the
contractual
assignment
conveyance
on
mortgage
to
the
mortgagee
of
this
right
given
under
new
york
law.
i
maintain
that
the
new
britain
case
does
not
apply
here.
new
britain
as
the
government
counsel
said
--
stated
started
in
the
superior
court
of
hartford
county
in
connecticut
as
an
ordinary
mortgage
foreclosure
and
proceeded
in
accordance
with
the
connecticut
foreclosure
law
until
after
a
sale
of
the
mortgage
premises
when
the
proceeds
were
brought
into
court
and
a
supplemental
judgment
was
then
rendered
which
directed
the
payment
from
those
proceeds
of
the
expenses
of
the
sale,
attaches
to
the
city
of
new
britain
the
amount
to
the
mortgagee,
the
amount
to
the
judgment
creditor,
and
the
balance
to
the
federal
lien.
the
government
appealed
from
this
decision
and
at
that
point,
the
city
of
new
britain
which
had
not
heretofore
--
theretofore
have
been
a
party
intervenes
so
that
it
might
contest
the
appeal.
in
the
supreme
court
of
errors
of
the
state
of
connecticut,
the
only
parties
present
were
the
government
and
the
city
of
new
britain,
and
the
only
issue
presented
to
the
court
was
the
irrelative
priority
of
the
federal
lien
and
the
city
taxes.
the
supreme
court
of
errors
of
connecticut
affirmed
the
con
--
the
superior
court
of
hartford
county
and
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court
which
was
granted.
and
again,
in
this
court,
the
only
parties
present
were
the
city
of
new
britain
and
the
government
and
again,
the
only
question
presented
was
the
relative
priority
of
the
federal
lien
and
the
city
taxes.
it
was
on
remand
to
the
connecticut
court
that
the
question
of
relative
--
of
the
rights
of
the
mortgagee
and
judgment
creditor
came
into
consideration
because
it
was
the
connecticut's
court
which
said
that
the
connecticut
procedure
required
the
payment
of
the
real
property
taxes
from
the
proceeds
of
the
sale.
this
court
did
not
say
that.
new
york
procedure
does
not
require
that
the
real
property
taxes
be
paid
from
the
proceeds
of
the
sale.either
the
property
can
be
so
subject
to
the
real
property
taxes
or
the
judgment
can
correct
that
the
referee
appointed
pay
them
as
an
expense
of
the
sale.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
considering
this
case
made
the
statement
that
there
was
no
question
of
circular
priority
in
new
york
since
first
the
real
property
taxes
were
paid
as
an
expense
of
the
sale
before
the
surplus
from
which
the
federal
lien
must
be
paid
was
created.
my
point
on
that
is
that
since
the
mortgagee
and
the
judgment
creditor
were
not
present
in
this
court
to
state
their
position
that
any
implications
in
the
new
britain
judgment
--
in
the
new
britain
decision
which
would
indicate
whereas
the
government
claims
that
the
--
this
court
intended
that
the
mortgagee
should
bear
the
expenses
of
the
real
property
taxes
is
over
to
take
the
--
as
far
as
they're
concerned.
i
point
out
at
this
time
that
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
the
ball
construction
company
decided
in
this
court
in
1958,
four
years
after
the
new
britain
case,
mr.
justice
whitaker
wrote
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
burton,
and
mr.
justice
harlan
joined.
and
in
that
dissenting
opinion,
made
the
statements
that
they
--
the
report
of
dissenting
justices
believed
that
the
controversy
in
new
britain
was
over
that
portion
of
the
proceeds
of
a
real
estate
mortgage
foreclosure
of
sale
which
exceeded
the
amount
of
the
mortgage.
it
added,
we
think
it
is
not
only
apparent
that
section
3672
(a)
had
no
application
to
that
case
but
also
that
the
court
expressly
so
declared.
and
further,
in
new
britain
this
court
was
not
dealing
with
any
mortgage
pledge
or
other
contractual
lien
or
with
any
question
of
priority
of
an
antecedent
mortgage
over
a
subsequently
filed
tax
liens.
as
i
say,
new
britain
did
not
consider
the
rights
of
the
mortgagee
and
judgment
creditors
and
new
britain,
anything
in
it
that
suggested
that
the
taxes
couldn't
be
paid
as
an
expense
of
sale
is
contrary
to
the
later
direct
holding
of
this
court
in
the
united
states
against
brosnan
that
they
might
be
paid
as
an
expense
of
sale.
as
it
pointed
out
in
the
majority
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
set
forth
at
page
80
in
the
record,
the
government's
brief
in
brosnan
brought
to
this
court's
attention
of
fact
that
there
was
a
pennsylvania
statute
very
similar
to
the
new
york
statute
which
said
that
in
order
to
--
when
you
conduct
the
foreclosure
sale
in
pennsylvania,
the
real
property
tax
is
against
the
mortgage
premises
have
to
be
paid
as
an
expense
of
the
sale.
that
was
brought
to
this
court's
attention
not
only
in
the
government's
brief,
but
also
in
the
opinion
in
the
circuit
court
below.
and
yet,
this
court
did
not
consider
it
as
sufficiently
valid
objection
to
the
pennsylvania
foreclosure
procedure
to
mention
it
in
its
opinion.
the
court
did
say
in
brosnan
that
we
believe
that
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned
the
need
for
uniformity
in
the
collection
of
federal
taxes
in
these
instance
is
outweighed
by
the
severe
dislocation
to
local
property
relationships
which
would
result
from
our
disregarding
state
procedure
and
to
apply
new
britain
as
the
government
pressed
that
it'd
be
done
here
would
severely
dislocate
or
establish
property
relations
in
new
york
and
we
put
new
york
mortgagees
at
a
distinct
disadvantage
to
the
pennsylvania
mortgagees
who
do
not
have
to
pay
the
taxes
or
contribute
towards
the
payment
of
the
federal
tax.
furthermore,
the
affirmance
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals'
judgment
in
this
case
would
be
in
accordance
with
the
intent
of
congress
when
it
enacted
section
3672
(a)
which
is
now
in
the
54
code
6323
(a).
that
is
the
section
which
says
that
a
prior
recorded
mortgage
has
had
--
has
priority
over
a
subsequently
filed
federal
tax
lien.
it
would
also
be
in
accordance
with
the
intent
of
congress
at
the
time
that
2410
of
title
28
was
adopted.
2410
is
the
enabling
section
by
which
a
mortgagee
may
join
the
federal
government
in
a
state
foreclosure
and
cut
off
the
lien
of
the
federal
government.
house
report
1018
on
the
62nd
congress,
second
section
at
the
time
they
were
considering
3672
(a)
said
there
is
no
reason
why
the
government
should
not
occupy
the
same
position
with
reference
to
liens
and
properties
as
does
the
individual.
and
house
report
95
of
the
71st
congress,
second
section
at
the
time
2410
was
being
considered
said
that
that
was
offered
as
legislation
to
correct
the
then
existing
situation
where
he,
the
mortgagee,
is
therefore
in
effect
defeated
of
his
own
right
to
foreclose
unless
he
is
willing
to
pay
off
the
government
lien
at
that
for
which
he
is
in
no
way
responsible
and
he
being
a
person
to
whom
the
government
would
in
no
way
look
for
its
payment.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
requirements
of
section
3672
(a)
are
not
satisfied
by
merely
setting
aside
the
amount
that's
due
the
mortgage
debt
without
regard
to
whether
the
mortgagee
gets
it
or
not.
the
government's
argument
is
based
on
a
misinterpretation
of
new
britain.
i've
already
pointed
out
that
in
1958
four
members
of
the
court
did
not
think
new
britain
had
anything
to
do
with
the
rights
of
mortgagees
and
judgment
creditors.
but
if
it
did,
all
the
court
said
there
was,
that
when
competing
for
payment
from
the
same
fund
at
the
same
time,
the
federal
lien
must
take
precedence
over
the
state
liens.
to
sustain
the
government's
contention
would
mean
that
that
--
this
court
meant
in
that
decision
that
regardless
of
what
the
circumstances
or
in
how
remote
--
how
remote
in
time,
no
state
procedure
can
prevent
the
federal
collector
from
getting
his
tax
from
the
mortgagee.
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
was
clearly
not
so
stated,
no
implication
to
that
effect
can
be
found
in
the
reading
of
the
new
britain
decision
and
four
members
of
this
court
have
thought
so.
we
contend
that
the
--
both
of
the
judgments
which
were
rendered
by
the
erie
county
court
were
proper.
the
first
one
is
subject
to
the
taxes.
it
takes
nothing
away
from
the
government
because
they're
not
--
there's
no
competition
at
the
time.
and
the
second
one
provided
for
the
payment
by
the
referee
to
foreclose
as
an
expense
of
sale
is
in
accordance
with
the
--
establish
new
york
foreclosure
procedure,
those
statutes
have
been
on
the
books
since
1880
and
they're
just
as
much
a
part
of
new
york
law
as
those
pennsylvania
statutes
which
say
same
thing
are
a
part
of
the
pennsylvania
law.
if
i
(inaudible)
--
excuse
me,
if
i
have
said
anything
of
consequence
here
the
other
day,
i
think
it
is
that
the
requirements
of
section
3672
(a),
now
6323
(a)
of
title
26
of
the
u.s.
code
are
not
satisfied
by
setting
aside
the
amount
of
the
debt
without
regard
to
whether
the
mortgagee
is
made
whole
there
from
or
not.
this
court
has
--
mr.
john
horace
little
i
haven't
gone
into
that,
mr.
justice
white
for
the
reason
that
it
isn't
involved
in
my
case.
i
would
--
mr.
john
horace
little
that's
correct
but
we
did
not
advance
it
because
at
that
time,
the
united
states
versus
bond
had
been
decided
and
that
in
that
court,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
have
said
that
if
the
mortgagee
advances
money
to
pay
taxes
which
have
accrued
after
the
filing
of
the
federal
lien
is
advancing
money
to
pay
it
on
--
in
court
lien
and
that
advance
cannot
take
precedent
over
the
federal
liens.
i
would
call
your
attention
to
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
--
circuit
judge
haynsworth
in
that
bond
case
where
at
some
length
he
said
that
if
he
believe
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
protect
the
mortgage
but
he
intend
--
it
intended
to
protect
the
mortgagee,
to
protect
the
mortgagee
and
all
of
rights
which
he
ordinarily
and
customarily
had
--
always
had,
namely
the
right
to
make
an
advance
necessary
to
preserve
the
security
for
his
indebtedness.
mr.
john
horace
little
no.
no
more
so
that
the
filing
--
mr.
john
horace
little
--
of
the
any
subsequent
--
mr.
john
horace
little
no
sir.
there
can
be
any
number
and
there
are
frequently
are
any
number
doing
your
mortgages
put
on
the
property
after
the
first
mortgage
and
there
can
be
judgments
obtained
against
the
owner.
there
can
be
mechanics
liens
filed
against
the
owner
but
as
long
as
he
pays
his
principal
and
interest,
and
as
long
as
he
pays
the
taxes,
there's
nothing
in
the
first
mortgagee
can
do
about
it.
mr.
john
horace
little
but
it
doesn't
come
within
any
provision
of
the
new
york
mortgage.
mr.
john
horace
little
we
have
it,
the
records
checked
once
a
year.
it
is
true
for
--
mr.
john
horace
little
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
horace
little
not
simply
because
the
federal
lien
was
filed.
mr.
john
horace
little
if
the
taxes
had
become
the
lien,
we
could,
yes.
mr.
john
horace
little
we
didn't
pay
the
taxes
and
we
didn't
foreclose
immediately.
the
effect
of
what
the
government
asked
here
that
we
establish
an
escrow
fund
or
without
an
escrow
fund,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
if
immediately
under
the
--
the
mortgagee
would
have
to
start
foreclosure.
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
give
any
leeway
to
the
owner
as
we
frequently
do
so
that
they
may
rehabilitate
themselves
and
save
their
property.
we
would
have
to
immediately
foreclose.
the
government
in
its
brief
says
i
believe
also
in
judge
fuld's
opinion
that
if
the
--
what
we
ask
is
that
--
would
make
it
necessary
for
the
federal
government
to
immediately
foreclose
its
lien
would
conversely
what
the
federal
government
asked
would
make
it
necessary
for
us
to
immediately
foreclose
our
lien.
as
i
say,
i
believe
the
important
thing
is
that
what
the
government
asked
for
here
is
directly
contrary
to
what
congress
said
it
intended
whether
it
enacted
this
section
giving
priority
to
the
mortgagee
over
subsequently
filed
lien.
i
tend
that
this
court
has
always
said
that
it
looks
to
substance
and
not
to
form.
so
the
mere
setting
aside
of
the
amount
to
the
mortgagee
without
regard
to
whether
he
gets
it
in
the
end
does
not
satisfy
the
requirements
of
that
section.
we
believe
that
it
doesn't
matter
what
theory
the
court
adopts
to
do
it.
you
can
adopt
my
theory
that
when
the
mortgage
--
mortgagee
on
the
execution
of
the
mortgage
received
the
contractual
right
to
have
the
taxes
paid
from
the
sale
proceeds
of
the
mortgage
property
and
that
constituted
the
diminution
of
the
ownership
rights
of
the
owner.
when
he
made
the
mortgage,
he
encumbered
his
property
and
he
encumbered
it
exactly
to
the
extent
of
the
terms
of
that
mortgage.
so
that
the
mortgage
--
the
lien
attached
to
the
proper
--
to
the
ownership
rights
of
the
--
property
rights
of
the
owner
in
the
mortgage
property
he
had
at
the
time
the
lien
was
filed.
or
you
can
sustain
the
new
york
court
of
appeals'
decision
on
the
ground
that
it's
an
established
foreclosure
procedure.
going
back
to
1880,
it
says
the
same
as
the
pennsylvania
pursuant
--
foreclosure
procedure
which
also
requires
the
payment
of
real
estate
taxes
as
a
part
of
the
foreclosure
proceeding
and
that
therefore
new
york's
procedure
must
be
as
good.
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
--
mr.
john
horace
little
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
that
the
--
well,
i
will
say
--
mr.
john
horace
little
i
don't
think
they
have
to
--
mr.
john
horace
little
they
do
have
to
be
paid
in
connecticut.
there's
no
question
about
it,
the
connecticut
court
said
so.
they
do
have
to
be
paid
in
pennsylvania.
there's
no
question
about
it
in
the
past
and
in
--
case,
these
sections,
ordinance
law
of
pennsylvania
are
said
--
are
cited.
in
new
york,
they
don't
have
to
be
paid.
the
property
can
be
sold
subject
to
them.
of
course,
in
those
states
where
as
in
the
bank
of
america
against
the
united
states,
the
companion
case
to
brosnan
where
the
foreclosure
is
under
the
exercise
of
a
part
of
sale
on
a
trustee
there
is
no
question
about
taxes
involved.
but
i
would
agree
with
you
that
in
most
states,
in
most
states
they
do
have
to
be
paid
as
an
expense
of
sale.
mr.
john
horace
little
the
purchaser
would
acquire
the
title
subject
to
those
federal
--
or
to
those
state
taxes
and
it
have
to
pay
them
after
the
sale
or
lose
the
property.
mr.
john
horace
little
yes.
in
the
brief
of
the
american
bar
association,
amicus
curiae,
they
advanced
a
further
theory
on
which
the
new
york
court
of
appeals'
decision
can
be
sustained.
and
that
is
that
since
the
federal
lien
attached
only
to
the
mortgagor's
property
interest
in
the
mortgage
property
and
there
is
no
question
about
that.
that's
been
held
time
after
time
after
time.
and
that
that
property
interest
of
the
mortgagor
was
always
subject
to
the
annual
recurring
charges
of
the
state's
taxing
authorities
to
raise
the
money
necessary
to
provide
essential
governmental
services
that
therefore,
the
federal
lien
attached
to
the
diminished
ownership
of
the
mortgagor
as
i've
just
expressed
it.
in
any
event,
i
believe
that
the
important
thing
is
to
stop
the
federal
tax
collector
from
fording
the
expressed
intention
of
congress
when
it
adopted
these
sections
and
that
is
that
the
prior
recorded
mortgage
get
paid
before
the
subsequently
filed
federal
tax
lien.
and
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
it's
not
as
important
that
we
should
have
a
right
to
advance
money
to
pay
taxes
as
it
is
that
we
should
get
back
to
principal
that
we
have
loaned
and
that
is
what
is
being
threatened
here.
in
addition
to
the
--
mr.
john
horace
little
but
that
is
something
that
we
can
see
and
know
what
will
be.
but
as
it's
cited
in
the
amicus
brief,
take
the
situation
of
a
$1000
mortgage
on
a
piece
of
property
where
there's
$1000
in
real
estate
taxes
against
which
of
federal
tax
lien
of
$10,000
is
filed.
the
property
is
sold
for
$10,000.
the
mortgagee
has
a
$1000
put
aside
for
him.
the
federal
government
gets
the
remaining
$9000.
there's
nothing
left
for
the
states
so
that
the
$1000
heretofore
set
aside
for
the
mortgagee
is
taken
from
him
and
given
to
the
state.
he
has
nothing.
mr.
john
horace
little
we
can
always
know
that
the
state
taxes
are
levied
at
a
certain
percentage
of
value
and
we
can
always
anticipate,
find
up
ahead,
when
it's
necessary
to
step
in
and
protect
our
interest
against
the
state
taxes.
there's
no
right
of
a
mortgagee
that
it
is
so
important
as
the
right
to
the
return
of
the
principle
of
the
amount
he
loaned.
and
what
--
when
that
right
is
threatened,
all
business
relationships
are
disrupted
and
long
standing
property
interests
are
threatened.
thank
you.
