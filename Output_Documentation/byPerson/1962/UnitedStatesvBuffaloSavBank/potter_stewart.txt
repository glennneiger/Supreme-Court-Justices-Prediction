yes.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
on
your
brief,
i
knew
about
the
bond
case,
that's
in
the
fourth
circuit.
justice
potter
stewart
your
brief
seems
to
indicate
a
different
point
of
view.
i
don't
know
--
because
i
was
able
to
find
--
justice

stewart
and
you
would
concede
that
those
come
before
the
federal
tax

justice

i
don't
quite
understand
the
argument
made
with
respect
to
what
happened
in
the
new
britain
case
on
remand
back
to
the
connecticut
court.
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
missed
your
very
first
statement,
mr.
little,
i
apologize
with
the

the
tax
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
such
you

he's
the
man
who
signed
the
check,
the
land
doesn't.
justice

could
not.
justice

just
proceed
against
the
land
and
so

--
justice
potter

isn't
that
--
that's
rather
a
standard
provision
i
suppose
in
most
states.
they
may
not
have
con

have
the
language
of
these

deemed
the

or
something
like
that
but
it's
a
standard
for
--
you
know,
its
around
--
most
the
states.
wouldn't
it
be
that
the
local
taxes
had
to
be
paid
in
the
mortgage
foreclosure
procedure?
it's
nothing
unique
in

if
the

justice

stewart
--
to
have

justice

in
massachusetts,

similar
to
that
of
pennsylvania?
