mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
federal
tax
lien
which
is
created
by
section
3670
of
1939
internal
revenue
code.
the
question
is
whether
a
subsequent
local
property
tax
lien
shall
be
preferred
over
an
earlier
federal
tax
lien
whether
because
of
the
existence
of
a
mortgage
to
which
the
federal
government
grants
priority
or
for
some
reason
peculiar
in
the
nature
of
the
local
property
tax.
the
facts
are
quite
simple
and
they're
undisputed.
in
1946,
the
respondent
bank,
lent
$2600
to
one
joseph
victory.
he
took
back
a
mortgage
covering
this
indebtedness
and
that
mortgage
was
created
in
1946.
seven
years
later,
in
1953,
united
states
filed
notice
of
a
federal
tax
lien
in
the
amount
of
some
$857,
and
this
was
against
victory.
in
1957,
four
years
later
starting
from
july
1,
1957,
local
liens
or
various
real
estate
taxes
owed
to
the
city
of
buffalo,
real
estate
taxes
owed
to
erie
county
and
certain
sewer
rents
began
accruing.
in
1958,
the
respondent
bank
brought
an
action
in
the
erie
county
court
to
foreclose
his
mortgage
which
by
that
time
had
been
paid
down
to
some
$1400
and
for
an
interest
of
5%.
when
the
united
states
answered
in
this
action,
its
originally
$157
lien
had
been
paid
down
to
$690,
and
the
record
that
gives
no
indication
that
mr.
victory
was
insolvent
as
the
court
will
recall
from
earlier
cases
when
it
goes
off
on
the
revised
statute
section
3466
that
there
is
an
indication
into
solvency.
that's
not
present
here
and
this
case
involves
the
federal
tax
lien
standing
alone
as
such.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
january
15,
1953.
there's
a
great
deal
of
time
difference
here.
let
me
just
go
through
those
again.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
the
mortgage
was
given
to
--
in
1946,
seven
years
later,
the
federal
tax
liens
came
along
in
1953
and
four
years
later,
the
local
tax
did
so
that
not
the
common
case
where
we're
worrying
about
a
minute
of
time.
there's
no
question
about
that
recording
in
here,
everything
that
needed
to
be
was
recorded
and
there's
no
close
interplay
there.
it's
a
remarkable
case
in
that
regard.
when
the
mortgagee
was
in
the
erie
county
court,
it
moved
for
summary
judgment
and
the
erie
county
court
granted
this
motion
and
said
that
property
should
be
sold
subject
to
local
taxes
but
free
and
clear
of
the
federal
tax
liens.
and
the
proceeds
would
then
go
to
satisfy
the
mortgage
debt
first.
now,
a
moment's
reflection
will
make
it
clear
that
if
the
property
is
sold
subject
to
the
local
taxes
that
price
which
a
bidder
is
willing
to
pay
will
be
reduced
by
the
amount
equal
to
the
local
taxes
since
there's
practically
no
way
of
escaping
that
obligation.
and
at
the
same
time,
since
the
federal
government
must
look
only
to
the
sales
proceeds,
its
chances
of
recovering
the
federal
tax
lien
under
that
form
of
sale
are
diminished.
and
on
appeal
by
the
government,
the
appellate
division
reversed
on
essentially
the
same
ground.
and
it's
--
on
its
remand,
its
--
it
suggested
that
the
local
authorities,
they
made
parties
to
the
action,
and
the
property
sold
free
and
clear
of
all
liens
with
the
priorities
to
be
determined
in
allocating
the
sales
proceeds
that
came
in.
when
the
case
went
back
to
the
county
court,
they
did
issue
an
order
saying
that
it
should
be
so
free
and
clear
of
all
liens
but
it
came
up
with
another
special
provision
that
provided
that
local
taxes
should
be
paid
as
expenses
of
sale
citing
the
section
1087
of
the
new
york
civil
practice
act
which
does
appear
to
say
that
for
purposes
of
that
article,
that
is
the
article
governing
sales
pursuant
to
mortgage
foreclosures
that
for
purposes
of
that
article,
local
taxes
shall
be
considered
expenses
of
sale
to
be
paid
by
the
person
handling
the
sale.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes.
that's
a
very
long
standing
law
and
might
make
it
right
clear
at
this
point
that
there's
no
suggestion
that
this
is
a
law
which
new
york
has
enacted
to,
to
put
something
over
into
federal
lien.
that
1880
as
the
date
that's
fixed
in
my
mind
that
that
law
come
from
my
--
i
would
submit
that
it
has
somewhat
a
different
purpose
read
in
context
of
the
new
york
act.
it
doesn't
say
that
they
are
expenses
of
sales
which
says,
that
they
shall
be
deemed
to
expenses
of
sale
and
while
being
this
quite
an
ambiguous
word,
i
have
a
feeling
that
it
means
something
less
than
saying
that
they
are
expenses
of
sale.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
implicit
on
the
point
and
i'm
not
sure
that
this
court
would
want
to
make
a
new
examination.
the
only
point
it
seems
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
it
seems
to
be
carrying
off
a
lot
of
freight
to
say
that
a
casual
phrase
that
it's
deemed
to
expense
of
sale
would
produce
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
think
that's
the
position.
but
on
--
when
this
county
court
judgment
again
was
appealed
to
the
appellate
division,
the
appellate
division
modified
the
judgment
and
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
necessary
to
apply
what
it
understood
to
be
the
rule
of
the
new
britain
case
which
is
cited
by
this
court.
and
that
rule
was
that
having
determined
that
the
sale
should
be
made
and
the
--
this
question
of
priority
should
be
resolve
in
the
allocation
of
the
fund
would
be
to
set
aside
an
amount
equal
to
the
amount
of
the
mortgage
which
the
federal
government
had
conceded
was
prior,
and
setting
aside
for
the
amount
of
mortgage
would
include
any
interest
do
on
the
mortgage.
then
from
all
other
proceeds,
they
should
go
first
to
pay
the
federal
lien
since
the
federal
lien
conceded
no
other
priority.
then
if
the
excess
proceeds
--
if
there
are
still
some
excess
proceeds
available,
they
would
be
used
to
pay
state
taxes.
and
then
as
the
last
resort,
the
state
lien
could
go
back
against
the
share
of
the
mortgagee
because
the
state,
as
a
matter
of
its
own
internal
law
had
said
that
it
should
have
priority
over
the
mortgagee.
this
case
then
went
on
appeal
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
it
was
reversed
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
an
opinion
by
judge
burke
and
four
other
judges,
with
judge
fuld
and
judge
foster
dissenting.
they
agreed
with
the
erie
county
court
that
the
payment
of
later
local
taxes
as
expenses
of
foreclosure
was
the
proper
result
under
the
new
york
statute.
the
dissenters
took
the
position
which
we
espouse
here
that
such
provision
runs
directly
contrary
the
decision
of
this
court
in
new
britain.
in
looking
at
this
case,
it
seems
to
the
government
that
it's
advantageous
to
recognize
that
the
two
liens
we're
talking
about
here
primarily
are
the
federal
tax
liens
which
have
been
very
strongly
characterized
by
this
court
over
the
years
as
intending
to
reach
every
piece
of
property
which
the
taxpayer
owned.
it
is
a
lien
in
support
of
certainly
a
basic
function
of
government
and
the
one
that's
crucial
to
the
existence,
the
gathering
of
revenue.
at
the
same
time,
states
typically,
place
great
reliance
of
--
if
not
major
reliance
on
the
property
tax
as
a
source
of
their
revenue
and
typically
the
state
gives
a
--
what
amounts
to
a
super
priority
to
the
property
tax
in
the
sense
that
they
--
the
state
does
not
care
at
what
point
a
person
acquires
an
interest
in
the
land.
anybody
who
wishes
to
deal
with
the
land
must
see
that
the
taxes
are
paid
whether
they
rose
prior
to
his
interests,
add
for
his
interest
or
in
any
other
circumstances.
and
so,
this
is
really
a
contest
of
wills
if
you
will
between
the
federal
government
fighting
hard
to
maintain
the
supremacy
of
its
federal
lien
and
the
state
government
relying
on
the
fair
effort
of
its
legislature
to
give
to
the
local
property
tax
everything
which
it
can
give.
now,
though
this
is
a
struggle
between
the
two
jurisdictions,
the
fact
is
in
the
case
before
us
and
in
all
cases
which
should
be
decided
under
the
new
britain
doctrine,
the
state
is
going
to
be
paid
because
the
federal
government
concedes
that
the
state
--
it
can't
--
its
grant
of
priority
to
the
mortgagee
is
not
a
sufficient
reason
for
it
to
step
in
and
forbid
the
mortgagee
from
paying
the
state,
and
thus
the
state
have
a
jurisdiction
over
the
mortgagee
typically
can
get
its
interest
from
there.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
after
the
--
after
they
arise
in
the
federal
tax
lien?
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
we
would
certainly
take
the
position
that
that
was
not
and
have
taken
the
litigation
that
if
it's
paid
afterwards
that's
not
given
the
original
priority
of
the
mortgage.
that's
not
before
this
court
now
but
we
have
maintained
that
position
in
litigation
in
the
bond
and
christensen
cases
from
(inaudible)
fourth
and
ninth
circuit.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
right.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
perhaps
at
this
point
that
we
do
think
there's
something
that
the
mortgagee
can
do.
a
mortgagee
can
set
up
an
arrangement
which
is
known
perhaps
by
experience
to
many
of
us
that
they
collect
the
fund
for
the
payment
of
tax
insurance.
this
was
involved
a
little
bit
in
the
bond
case
and
it
wasn't
litigated.
and
if
they
set
up
an
escrow
fund
to
pay
taxes
and
insurance,
the
mortgagee
can
keep
those
things
current
and
have
immediate
notice
as
soon
as
there
is
a
likelihood
of
default.
the
mortgagee
pays
the
taxed
themselves,
knows
what's
going
on
if
the
monthly
payments
are
not
coming
in
and
the
escrow
fund
isn't
building
up,
it
knows
immediately
that
there
is
a
danger
of
running
up
tax
liability.
so
therefore,
it
will
have
notice.
now,
this
is
not
to
say
that
if
it
lets
the
matter
run
on
that
it
has
any
way
to
protect
itself
beyond
that
point
because
we
can't
let
him
pay
the
taxes
before
but
we
can
let
him
take
taxes
before
the
federal
lien
arises
and
back
to
the
mortgage.
but
after
the
federal
lien
arises,
he's
making
a
subsequent
event
after
the
federal
government
and
we
see
no
reason
why
that
event
should
be
maintained
but
the
escrow
arrangement
will
keep
him
fully
current.
and
then
since
he
has
immediate
notice
of
the
default,
he
can
at
that
time
check
the
federal
tax
lien
status
and
see
whether
he
wishes
to
make
further
advances
or
wishes
to
foreclose.
and
that's
a
matter
which
we
feel
the
mortgagee
is
in
a
much
closer
position
to
us,
say,
than
the
federal
government,
because
it
seems
to
us
that
in
a
great
majority
of
cases,
it's
going
to
be
the
mortgagee
who's
expose
to
the
situation.
the
federal
government
operates
from
--
operates
with
a
tremendous
number
of
taxpayers
--
how
many
millions
of
taxpayers
are
delinquent
--
i
don't'
offer
here.
i
don't
know
the
number
but
certainly
it's
more
than
a
number
who
are
delinquent
in
the
hands
of
any
one
mortgagee.
so
i
would
like
to
state
again
that
the
context
here
is
who
is
going
to
bear
a
super
priority
which
the
state
imposes
or
which
the
state
grants
its
own
taxes.
is
it
going
to
be
the
federal
government
or
is
it
going
to
be
the
mortgagee?
and
if
there's
an
inequity
in
this,
in
our
position,
that
it
should
be
born
by
the
mortgagee,
we
would
suggest
that
it
comes
not
from
the
federal
government
adopting
an
equitable
position
but
from
the
state
courts
refusing
to
yield
the
priority
of
its
local
lien
for
any
prior
right
that
has
vested
even
before
the
local
lien
has
come
into
being.
in
support
of
the
decision
below,
and
i
think
this
is
a
fair
characterization
of
the
brief
which
had
been
filed
in
this
court,
there
run
two
things.
the
first
and
what
i
would
like
to
characterize
is
the
nominal
thing.
it
goes
on
new
york
property
law,
section
1087
which
makes
these
expenses
--
makes
these
payments
of
local
taxes
expenses
of
sale.
and
i
think
a
careful
reading
of
the
opinions
in
the
briefs
make
it
clear
that
none
of
the
parties
espousing
this
view,
believe
that
it
can
stand
alone,
that
a
mere
characterization
of
that
nature
can't
override
the
clear
mandate
of
this
court
in
new
britain.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
if
these
local
taxes
were
to
be
treated
as
expenses
of
sale,
it
would
seem
hard
to
find
the
limit
on
the
expenses
which
could
not
be
treated
as
expenses
of
sale
because
surely
the
expenses
of
sale
hitherto
an
innocuous
word
for
federal
tax
purposes
does
indicate
something
with
some
relation
to
the
mechanics
of
posing
out
an
account
getting
property
into
--
straightened
out
and
setting
out
a
new
title
to
the
property.
but
it
doesn't
--
and
to
things
that
are
related
to
that
process.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
the
things
like
are
an
auctioneer's
fee.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
and
perhaps
to
the
tax
expenses
accruing
while
it's
in
the
hands
of
the
court.
in
other
words,
the
tax
became
due
in
the
brief
period
of
times
in
the
court's
hand.
that
might
stand
on
a
different
status.
but
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
--
it
must
be
related
in
time
to
this
mechanical
process
of
using
the
judicial
process
to
enforce
a
--
the
right
of
a
mortgagee.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
except
it
seems
to
me
that
the
federal
lien
has
already
made
a
substantial
concession
in
saying
that
any
federal
liens
will
give
this
man
everything
that
he
took
prior
to
the
date
they
recorded
the
federal
lien.
they
say
to
a
mortgagee,
“if
you
get
your
mortgage,
prior
to
the
date
that
we
attach
our
lien,
we
will
not
go
against
that
interest
that
you
have
on
that
date”.
so,
the
federal
government
has
already
made
a
concession.
the
state
makes
not
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
of
course
that
will
depend
a
great
deal
on
the
individual
figures
but
whatever
you
may
say
about
the
federal
government's
generosity,
it
far
exceeds
the
state.
the
state
has
given
nothing.
it
says
that
the
tax
stays
with
the
land
no
matter
what.
you
can't
--
he
can't
have
equity
against
the
state
tax.
so
that
(inaudible)
--
in
the
--
the
federal
government
has
made
one
move,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
we're
talking
about
equities,
the
next
move
is
up
to
the
state
if
they're
really
that
interested
in
the
equity.
so
i
believe
that
this
characterization
of
expenses
of
sale
as
espoused
by
the
respondent
here
is
not
sufficient
to
carry
the
case.
and
it
must
be
--
this
court
is
called
upon
to
either
say
that
the
new
britain
case
did
not
reach
the
point
which
we
say
it
did
reach
and
it's
decisive
of
the
question
here
or
else
that
it
was
wrongly
decided.
and
thus,
i
think
that
is
the
substance
of
the
argument
here.
and
the
basis
for
this
as
it's
made,
is
that
local
property
taxes
have
historically
a
very
close
relationship
to
land
and
that
there
is
in
people's
minds
appealing
that
the
local
property
taxes
relate
very
closely
to
the
services
and
the
protection
which
are
given
to
the
land.
and
they
look
to
various
provisions
of
local
law
which
show
this
close
relationship.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
in
the
amicus
brief
there's
a
suggestion
that
there
is
no
personal
liability
for
new
york
property
taxes.
we
did
not
answer
this
in
our
reply
brief
but
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
examination
of
the
new
york
law
will
suggest
that
there
is
a
personal
liability
for
the
real
property
tax.
if
i
may
give
a
citation,
i
suggest
that
section
71
of
the
1959
edition
of
the
tax
law
would
be
a
citation
that
would
make
that
clear.
i
just
--
i'm
sorry,
we
didn't
put
that
in
our
brief.
i
wouldn't
think
the
court
would
want
to
pick
that
statement
up
in
error.
mr.

the
1959
--

tax
law.
this
is
mckinney's
new
york
--
mr.
mckinney's
new
york
consolidated
laws.
there
is
a
more
current
provision
but
that
wouldn't
have
been
governing
at
the
time
of
this
action.
now
i'm
sure
there's
a
superficial
appeal
to
treating
this
mystical
relationship
between
the
property
and
its
property
tax
in
the
local
services
and
viewing
every
holder
of
property
as
having
something
that
can
be
periodically
diminished
by
local
taxes.
and
it's
certainly
possible
to
imagine
the
system
of
government
that
allows
this
kind
of
state
priority
for
local
property
taxes.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be
a
better
system
than
our
own
but
it
seems
to
me
clear
from
the
decision
of
this
court,
it
is
not
the
system
which
has
been
adopted
and
followed
for
many
years.
the
--
in
united
states
v.
schneider
in
1893,
this
court's
spoke
in
the
strongest
possible
terms
about
the
priority
of
the
federal
tax
lien,
the
language
that
was
in
the
revised
statute
at
that
time
was
i
suppose
as
one
could
imagine
to
the
present
language
of
the
tax
laws,
the
court
pointed
out
to
what
extent
it
was
in
the
work
and
move
of
the
constitution
that
this
federal
tax
lien
must
have
priority
over
everything
in
the
country.
and
20
years
later,
congress
didn't
repudiate
this
decision
in
any
sense
but
it
did
announce
that
there
would
be
specified
categories
of
people
who
would
be
protected
against
this
all
prevailing
tax
lien.
that
is
the
section
3672
which
is
amply
cited
to
you.
and
if
there
was
any
question
about
the
application
of
this
sup
--
of
this
heavy
priority
of
the
federal
government
to
state
and
local
taxes,
we
submit
that
that
was
put
to
rest
in
the
michigan
versus
united
states
case
in
1943
where
chief
justice
stone
speaking
for
a
unanimous
court
made
it
very
clear
that
it
would
be
no
grounds
for
holding
that
any
different
rule
applied
to
state
and
local
taxes.
and
he
gave
full
consideration
to
these
arguments
about
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
local
tax.
and
then
comes
to
what
is
to
us
the
key
case,
one
we
could
submit
fully
governs
here
and
that
is
the
new
britain
case
decided
1954
again
by
a
unanimous
court.
there,
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
were
insufficient
to
satisfy
the
mortgagee's
federal
tax
lien
and
the
local
taxes.
it
came
up
to
this
court
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
was
there
arguing
to
somewhat
a
stronger
or
more
extreme
if
you
will
position
that
is
now
arguing,
if
they're
contented
that
local
tax
liens
were
entitled
to
--
not
specifically
mentioned
in
the
statute
and
as
long
as
they
were
mere
liens,
it
hadn't
been
reduced
the
possession,
they
were
entitled
to
no
priority
at
all.
but
this
court
examined
the
precedent
and
legislative
history
and
decided
that
congress
in
enacting
the
federal
tax
lien
intended
to
include
the
first
in
time,
first
in
right
doctrine.
and
then
it
went
on
to
say
that
any
local
liens
which
are
superior
--
which
proceeded
in
time,
the
federal
tax
lien
would
be
given
priority.
then
it
was
left
with
the
question
what
about
the
mortgagee
who
is
protected
under
federal
law
but
not
protected
under
state
law
and
so
that
the
effect
of
not
giving
further
priority
to
the
local
taxes
would
be
to
take
the
local
taxes
out
of
his
share.
the
court
on
page
88
spoke
very
clearly,
and
i
think
it
completely
refutes
the
contention
that
they
did
not
consider
this
imposition
on
the
mortgagee.
there
they
said,
united
states
is
not
interested
in
whether
the
state
receives
its
taxes
and
water
rents
prior
to
the
mortgagees
and
judgment
creditor.
that
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
and
in
context,
there's
no
question
that
the
court
held
that
that
would
have
to
be
the
result.
and
we
think
that
this
--
there
is
no
reason
for
departing
from
this
rule
at
this
time.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
under
the
federal
law.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
no
no,
it's
not
that.
they
said
its
--
the
mortgagee
is
first
but
he
is
limited
to
the
amount
of
his
mortgage.
and
that
set
aside
in
what
was
called
here
a
priority
adjustment
fund.
and
then
you
pay
the
federal
lien.
now
that
maybe
nothing.
it
maybe
peanuts
or
it
may
pay
it
off
entirely.
in
which
case,
there
would
be
a
surplus
which
would
then
go
to
state
taxes.
but
after
you
have
taken
the
--
in
the
excess
fund
they're
over
the
mortgagee
fund,
you
go
first
to
the
federal
and
then
to
the
state.
if
you
need
more
to
satisfy
the
state,
you
can
go
back
against
the
mortgagee
but
you
can't
do
it
to
satisfy
the
federal
government.
and
i
think
the
crucial
thing
to
sort
out
in
these
arguments
which
are
made
by
respondent
here
is
that
many
of
them
apply
regardless
of
whether
there's
a
mortgagee
in
the
picture.
these
arguments
about
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
state
tax
lien
of
necessity
would
state
that
whatever
the
federal
government
completes
--
competes
against
a
local
property
lien,
the
federal
government
would
lose.
and
as
i
said
that
maybe
a
considerable
system
of
law
but
it
is
one
against
which
this
court
has
spoken
clearly
and
specifically
on
many
occasions
in
the
past.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
it
is
the
con
--
well,
it
is
the
intention,
as
i
believe,
of
respondents
that
this
court
did
not
realize
that
the
effect
of
their
holding
to
say
that
the
mortgagee's
preference
would
be
limited,
the
amount
of
the
mortgage.
--
was
not
unaware
of
it
by
that
language
i
quoted
from
page
88.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
no,
it's
a
little
confusing
to
read
because
the
fact
that
it
isn't
the
mortgagee
at
all,
he's
a
judgment
creditor
who
is
the
lawman,
they
had
first
a
mortgagee,
a
second
mortgagee
and
the
judgment
creditor
but
they
can
all
be
considered
as
mortgagees
for
this
purpose
and
he
--
it's
very
clear
that
he
didn't
get
the
money
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
right.
the
state
tax
had
to
be
satisfied.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
have
just
three
quick
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
say
that
examples
can
be
multiplied
and
what's
sauce
for
the
goose
is
sauce
for
the
gander.
if
you
change
the
amount
of
the
liens
and
the
example
given
by
the
bar
association
and
have
the
large
lien
be
the
local
tax
lien,
you'll
find
the
federal
government
by
making
a
grant
to
a
modest
grant
of
priority
to
a
modest
mortgage
find
itself
stopped
with
having
the
local
taxes
in
large
amount
paid
out.
the
hypothetical
can
be
multiplied
but
they're
certain.
and
this
is
not
to
disagree
with
the
point
made
by
mr.
little
that
there
are
occasions
when
the
application
of
this
rule
will
put
the
mortgagee
with
no
opportunity
during
this
but
foreclose
because
that
will
have
to
be
a
result
in
some
situations
where
the
tax
liens
are
large
in
amount
and
do
eat
up
any
remaining
equity.
mr.
little
mentioned
in
the
brosnan
case,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
with
him
that
there
was
in
the
record
in
that
case
a
claim
of
this
nature
under
new
britain
which
could
have
been
made.
it
was
not.
now
i
don't
know
whether
that
was
a
matter
of
government
strategy
or
government
overconfidence
but
there
was
a
much
more
important
point
in
the
case
which
we
thought
the
state
procedure
should
not
to
be
applied
at
all.
and
this
point
was
not
raised
of
the
--
at
the
end,
the
factor
of
the
judgment
was
that
the
new
britain
point
did
slip
by.
point
is
made
in
the
reply
brief
that
we
did
not
--
we
do
not
now
contest
this
in
pennsylvania.
it's
quite
difficult
to
turn
these
cases
up
under
the
brosnan
rule
because
we
have
to
search
the
record
ourselves,
find
cases
where
federal
interests
are
involved,
and
then
they
have
to
be
ones
where
the
value
of
the
property
exceeds
that
at
the
mortgage
before
this
point
comes
up
at
all.
we
are,
however,
raising
the
point
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
in
a
case
involving
milton
savings
bank
and
that's
under
consideration
by
that
court
at
that
time
so
is
not
in
any
sense
conceded
it.
and
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
similar,
yes.
for
that
(inaudible)
--
for
these
purposes,
it's
substantially
similar.
and
then
just
lastly,
i
have
section
71
before
me
and
whatever
maybe
the
practice
in
new
york,
the
section
71
did
say
that
if
he
doesn't
pay
it,
he
shall
be
firstly
liable
for
the
tax
assessed
against
such
parcel
or
portion
of
real
property.
and
i
think
that
the
law
in
practice
may
diverge
but
there
is
inherent
in
there
a
personal
liability
for
the
tax.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
he
can
keep
his
mortgagor
current
by
this
escrow
arrangement
device
so
that
he
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
when
he
have
security,
he
has
complete
security
against
the
federal
tax
under
3672
except
to
the
extent
that
the
state
cuts
in
with
its
state
tax
so
he
can't
--
assuming
that
he's
correctly
judged
the
security
of
the
underlying
property.
he
can't
be
hurt
anymore
than
the
state
taxes.
and
he
can
keep
fairly
current
on
those
or
there
will
be
a
small
amount
which
he
cannot
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
frankly
in
advance
and
by
a
suitable
escrow
agreement.
i'm
not
saying
everyone
will
pass
but
that
was
involved
in
the
bond
case
and
there
was
no
question
raised.
