ms.
constance
b.
motley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
united
states
court
of
appeals
from
the
sixth
circuit.
before
this
court
for
review
is
the
judgment
of
that
circuit,
affirming
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
tennessee.
the
judgment
affirmed
by
the
sixth
circuit
denied
petitioners,
negro
residents
of
memphis,
tennessee,
an
injunction
against
continued
exclusion
of
negroes
from
a
large
number
of
recreational
facilities
in
the
city
of
memphis.
however,
that
injunction,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
rather,
provided
for
desegregation
of
these
recreational
facilities
on
a
gradual
basis.
now,
in
providing
for
the
gradual
as
opposed
to
the
immediate
enforcement
of
petitioners’
rights
to
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
in
this
case,
the
courts
below
relied
upon
this
court's
decision
in
the
second
brown
case,
involving
desegregation
of
public
schools
where
this
court
recognized
that
a
delay
might
be
permitted
in
the
enforcement
of
the
constitutional
rights
there
involved
once
a
start
had
been
made
upon
a
demonstration
by
the
school
authority
that
the
resolution
of
specifically
enumerated
physical
problems
would
make
for
a
smoother
transition
from
a
segregated
to
a
desegregated
system.
now,
before
proceeding
to
a
discussion
of
the
facts
in
this
case,
i
would
just
like
to
say
briefly
what
our
contentions
are.
petitioners
say,
first,
that
their
constitutional
rights
here
to
use
the
publicly
owned
and
operated
recreational
facilities
in
this
case
should
have
been
immediately
enforced
by
the
courts
below
because
these
are
personal
and
present
constitutional
rights.
second,
petitioners
say
that
irrespective
of
whether
the
second
brown
decision
has
any
application
beyond
the
area
of
schools,
that
decision
has
no
applicability
to
the
area
of
public
recreation.
and
finally
our
contention
is
that
even
assuming
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
that
the
second
brown
case
would
apply
in
the
area
of
public
recreation
upon
a
demonstration
of
complex
and
difficult
physical
problems,
the
record
here
fails
to
justify
the
applicability
of
the
principles
of
the
second
brown
case
to
this
case.
now
this
controversy
presently
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes
this
is
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
this
case
presently
involves
the
exclusion
of
negroes
from
58
neighborhood
parks,
from
crump
stadium.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
well
these
i
understand
are
neighborhood
parks
on
which
playground
facilities
are
located
generally.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes,
there
is
and
the
record
indicates
that
there
is
a
highly
organized
playground
program
in
memphis
and
that
they
are
operated
on
these
so
called
neighborhood
parks,
some
are
operated
on
parks
attached
to
the
public
schools,
some
on
property
owned
by
churches
and
private
groups.
now
negro
growth
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
pardon
me?
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right
sir.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
no,
these
are
the
facilities
from
which
neighborhoods
are
presently
excluded.
there
are
some
playground
facilities
available
to
negroes,
i'm
now
speaking
of
only
those
from
which
we
are
presently
excluded,
and
that's
58
in
number.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes,
i
think
there
is
something
like
40
available
to
negroes
at
the
present
time.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
well
now
i
don't
think
that
any
of
these
playground
facilities
are
integrated.
they
have
integrated
25
parks,
but
i
think
what
these
are
the
squares
with
a
statue
and
a
few
benches.
now
25
of
those
have
been
desegregated,
but
what
i'm
taking
about
now
are
playground
facilities
in
the
so
called
neighborhood
parks
and
they
are
58
in
number
from
which
negroes
are
excluded.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
pardon
me?
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes,
that's
right,
yes.
they
are
parks
with
swings
and
wading
pools
and
that
sort
of
thing
from
which
negro
children
are
excluded.
in
fact
in
the
record
one
women
testified,
a
mrs.
bonn
that
she
went
to
gaston
park
and
she
lives
next
door
and
she
took
her
eight
children
or
whatever
number
and
she
was
denied
admission
because
she
is
a
negro,
but
she
lives
right
next
door
to
that
park
and
those
are
the
kinds
of
facilities
involved
here.
and
then
negroes
are
excluded
from
crump
stadium
which
is
a
large
stadium,
a
stadium
and
other
stadiums
in
the
city.
they
are
also
excluded
from
the
museum
known
as
pink
palace.
then
they
are
excluded
from
40
playgrounds
on
property
not
owned
by
the
city,
these
are
those
attached
to
churches
or
private
groups
or
school,
not
owned
by
the
city
as
such.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
oh
yes,
these
are
now
trying
to
bring
out
those
facilities
from
which
we
are
excluded.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
but
i'm
sorry.
they
are
operated
by
the
park
authority,
which
is
a
respondent
here.
the
park
authority
provides
supervisory
personnel
and
furnishes
the
facilities
on
this
land
owned
by
someone
else
and
that's
how
they
are
involved
in
this
case.
then
involved
are
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes,
that's
right.
it's
operated
by
a
public
authority.
now
in
addition
there
are
five
swimming
pools
from
which
negroes
are
excluded,
eight
community
centers
and
one
golf
course.
and
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
they
desegregated
21
of
these
squares,
and
in
addition
after
the
suit
was
filed
overton
park
zoo
was
desegregated
and
an
art
gallery
in
overton
park
and
then
they
desegregated
a
boat
dock
on
a
lake
in
a
white
park.
now
negroes
can't
use
the
park,
but
they
can
walk
through
the
park
to
get
to
the
boat
dock.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
one
day
a
week
that's
right.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
well
my
understanding
is
that
it
has
not
been
filed
in
the
district
court.
however,
when
this
case
was
argued
before
the
sixth
circuit,
one
of
the
judges,
judge
starr
said
“well
what
about
your
plan?”
and
they
--
the
respondents
had
a
copy
of
it
and
they
handed
up
that
plan
and
it
was
made
available
to
the
court,
and
then
they
sent
us
a
copy
and
that
plan
provides
for
the
desegregation
of
these
remaining
segregated
facilities
over
a
ten-year
period,
but
that
is
not
in
the
record.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
my
understanding
that
it
has
not
been
filed.
we
checked
i
think
yesterday.
mr.
willis
from
memphis
was
the
clerk
there
and
he
said
it
has
not
been
filed.
now
they
may
be
able
to
give
a
date
on
which
it
has
been
filed,
but
further
there
has
been
no
hearing
in
the
district
court
on
that
plan.
now
the
district
court
accepted
a
preliminary
plan.
the
respondents
here
said
to
the
district
court
“well
now
we
are
prepared
to
desegregate
the
fairground
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
we
don't
want
to
do
that
till
the
end
of
the
year
because
concessionaires
may
lose
money
if
negroes
go
in
and
people
stay
away
and
so
forth.”
and
then
they
said
we
are
prepared
to
desegregate
the
golf
courses
because
several
of
the
plaintiffs
had
gone
to
white
golf
courses
and
had
been
denied,
even
though
they
lived
nearer
to
the
white
one
and
the
district
court
approved
the
desegregation
of
the
fairground
at
the
end
of
the
year,
six
months
later
and
the
desegregation
of
seven
golf
courses
over
a
three-year
period.
now
they
have
carried
out
that
desegregation
as
i
understand
it
and
there
is
one
more
golf
course
according
to
their
schedule,
which
in
a
record
at
page
94,
where
galloway
golf
course
is
deemed
to
be
desegregated
on
january
1,
1964
and
then
all
golf
courses.
then
they
also
said
to
the
district
court,
we
are
going
to
desegregate
six
parks
to
negroes,
referring
to
some
of
these
playground
facilities
that
we
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
but
no
dates
were
given
and
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
those
parks
are
still
segregated.
now
they
maybe
able
to
say
that
they
have
segregated
even
some
of
those,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
large
numbers
of
facilities
are
still
--
negroes
are
still
excluded
to
the
large
number
of
these
facilities.
now
the
district
court
after
accepting
that
preliminary
plan
directed
the
defendants
to
bring
in
another
plan
in
six
months
with
regard
to
all
these
other
facilities.
then
the
district
court
stayed
adjudication
of
the
right
of
negroes
to
go
into
pink
palace
on
the
other
six
days
of
the
week,
until
such
time
as
the
respondents
filed
a
suit
for
declaratory
judgment
in
the
chancery
court
of
shelby
county
as
to
the
effect
on
the
title
of
a
city,
the
admission
of
negroes
to
the
pink
palace
regulars.
the
respondents
claim
that
they
couldn't
admit
negroes
to
the
pink
palace
regularly,
because
this
would
violate
a
limitation
in
the
deed
to
the
city,
which
said
that
this
property
was
given
to
the
city
to
operate
as
a
museum
or
art
gallery
for
whites
only.
now
in
violation
of
that
restriction
of
course
they've
been
admitting
negroes
for
number
of
years,
but
they
claim
that
they
would
have
to
have
this
adjudicated
first
and
they
have
filed
a
suit.
the
district
court
gave
them
three
months
in
which
file
it.
they
filed
that
suit
on
september
1,
1961.
there
has
been
no
answer.
apparently,
the
grantor
or
his
assign
no
longer
exists,
and
nobody
has
answered
that
suit,
it's
just
pending
there
and
there
is
no
real
controversy
obviously,
but
the
district
court
invoked
the
doctrine
of
abstention
and
said
that
he
would
stay
this
until
that
was
determined.
but
abstention
was
improperly
applied
there
because
the
question
before
the
district
court
was
whether
negroes
could
be
excluded
as
long
as
the
city
was
operating
it
and
no
matter
how
the
state
court
proceeding
came
out,
the
district
court
would
still
have
to
determine
that
because
what
we're
attacking
was
a
policy
of
these
respondents
of
excluding
negroes
from
these
facilities,
not
a
restriction
in
the
deed
because
negroes
are
being
excluded
from
properties
on
which
there
was
no
such
restriction.
so
it
still
has
to
determine
that
even
if
the
state
court
should
for
some
reason
on
the
tenancy
law
hold
that
restriction
void.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes
sir.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
no,
i
believe
that
on
that
one
day,
tuesday
negroes
other
than
whites
are
not
allowed.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
my
understanding
of
it,
yes.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
now
the
judgment
below
finally
provided
that
the
district
court
would
retain
jurisdiction
of
this
case
for
further
orders
and
so
forth.
however,
the
petitioner's
immediately
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
which
affirmed
the
district
court's
ruling,
relying
as
district
court
did
on
this
court's
decision
in
the
second
brown
case.
now
our
argument
is
as
i
have
indicated
that
the
courts
below
erred
in
refusing
to
enjoin
this
admitted
violation
of
a
basic
and
fundamental
constitutional
right
clearly
established
by
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
now
prior
to
the
brown
decision,
this
court
had
firmly
established
that
the
right
to
equal
protection
of
the
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
a
personal
and
present
constitutional
right
and
was
always
immediately
enforced.
in
the
brown
case,
the
court
recognized
that
with
the
desegregation
of
public
school
systems
in
all
of
the
states
in
the
south,
which
involved
the
unification
of
dual
school
systems
into
a
single
unitary
non-racial
system,
obviously
would
be
involved
tremendous
problems,
and
the
court
therefore
made
an
exception.
and
the
court
indicated
in
cooper
against
aaron
that
this
wasn't
a
general
rule
applicable
to
schools
altogether
that
even
in
some
school
situation,
the
district
court
might
order
the
immediate
admission
of
negro
children.
now
in
the
couple
of
cases
that
were
here
following
brown,
this
court
made
it
clear
that
state
enforced
racial
segregation
in
public
facilities
were
unconstitutional.
in
dawson
against
mayor
and
city
council
of
baltimore,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
this
court
affirmed
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
so
holding.
and
there
the
city
argued
in
their
jurisdictional
statement
at
page
19,
the
second
brown
decision
applied.
so
this
question
is
already
been
considered
by
this
court.
this
court
didn't
simply
deny
certiorari
there.
this
court
considered
that
case
although
without
argument
and
affirmed,
so
it
obviously
considered
the
contentions
raised
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
now
even
if
the
second
brown
decision
does
have
some
applicability
beyond
public
schools,
we
say
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
area
of
public
recreation
because
obviously
public
recreation
is
not
as
complex
as
the
school
system.
you
don't
have
compulsory
attendance,
you
don't
have
transportation
of
children,
you
don't
have
assignment
of
children,
nobody
has
to
go
a
public
park.
you
don't
have
overcrowding
in
one
building
like
you
would
have
in
a
school
situation,
you
don't
have
a
close
supervision
with
the
teacher
in
every
class,
one
of
these
playgrounds
would
probably
have
one
or
at
most
two
supervisors.
and
all
it's
really
involved
in
desegregation
of
public
recreation
like
desegregation
of
the
buses,
the
city
wide
system
of
transportation
is
the
removal
of
the
sign
saying,
negroes
here
and
whites
there,
and
a
public
announcement
to
this
effect.
it's
really
all
that's
involved
in
desegregation
of
recreational
facility.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
now
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes,
the
record
indicates
that
they
are
negro;
well,
there
are
negroes
and
whites
employed.
the
negroes
are
employed
of
course
to
work
in
the
negro
parks,
but
they
use
the
same
administrative
office
i
believe
as
their
headquarters.
to
that
extent
it's
integrated,
that's
way
i
read
the
record.
now
apart
from
precedent,
we
feel
that
there
are
strong
policy
considerations
why
this
court's
decision
in
the
second
brown
case
should
be
limited
rather
than
expanded.
first
of
all,
as
i've
said,
the
deliberate
speed
doctrine
enunciated
in
the
second
brown
case
is
an
anomaly
with
respect
to
personal
and
present
constitutional
rights,
especially
such
highly
prized
rights
as
equal
protection
of
the
law.
and
then,
this
all
deliberate
speed
doctrine
with
respect
to
the
school
has
resulted
in
a
mass
of
litigation
around
the
school
issue.
some
of
these
school
cases
have
been
pending
for
five
and
six
years
resulting
in
the
admission
of
a
handful
of
negroes,
all
because
of
this
--
what
is
deliberate
speed,
how
fast
and
school
board
have
to
go,
what
we
get
is
12-year
plans
and
pupil
assignments
and
all
of
this
resulting
in
about
7%
of
negroes
being
desegregated
in
the
last
nine
years.
and
then,
the
deliberate
speed
doctrine
i
think
has
been
widely
interpreted
as
substituting
a
doctrine
of
gradualism
for
the
separate
but
equal
doctrine
in
the
area
of
race
relations.
and
certainly,
it
is
extended
from
schools
to
parks
where
we
will
have
in
the
enforcement
of
constitutional
rights
to
negroes
is
a
gradualism
in
every
area
and
instead
of
shortening
any
period
of
disquiet
and
confusion
that
would
certainly
lengthen
the
period
of
racial
unrest
and
disturbance
and
then
as
i
said
on
the
whole,
there
has
been
a
very
little
desegregation.
now
finally,
as
i've
said
before,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
support
the
applicability
of
the
principles
in
the
second
brown
decision
to
this
case
because
there
is
not
a
single
demonstration
of
any
complex
physical
problem
with
which
the
respondent
had
to
deal,
which
would
require
the
application
of
that
doctrine.
i
would
like
to
save
the
remaining
time.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
well,
i
don't
know
the
exact
number
of
negro
children
admitted,
but
i
think
that
case,
a
representative
from
memphis
argued
here
about
a
month
ago
involving
the
transfer
provisions
as
amicus
curiae
and
i
think
he
stated
at
that
time,
there
were
66
negro
children
admitted,
but
the
district
court
has
not
yet
acted
upon
any
plan
in
memphis.
it
was
filed
about
a
year
ago
and
there
has
never
been
a
hearing.
it's
scheduled
for
may
22nd.
the
sixth
circuit
more
than
year
ago
sent
it
back
for
the
plan,
but
there
has
been
no
hearing
on
it.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
i
believe
that
there
should
be,
your
honor.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
i
believe
that
there
should
be,
i
didn't
check
it.
certainly
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
as
mr.
prewitt
has
stated
the
typewritten
transcript
of
all
of
the
testimony
is
here
in
this
court.
and
on
page
45
of
the
first
volume,
it
is
made
clear
that
those
parks,
which
are
already
desegregated
or
which
had
been
desegregated
prior
to
the
institution
of
the
suit
to
25
of
these
squares
and
the
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes
sir,
the
25
that
had
been
already
desegregated.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
and
as
it
appears
on
page
45
of
the
typewritten
transcript
of
the
testimony,
at
that
time,
the
superintendent
of
the
parks
was
going
over
the
list
of
all
the
facilities
and
he
had
in
his
hand
plaintiff's
exhibit
6
and
he
has
the
summary
of
all
these
facilities
and
there
is
one
category
on
the
top
marked
“general”
and
the
counsel
examining
him
said,
“doesn't
general
mean
these
--
he
said
alright,
in
this
category
called
general
up
there,
number
one,
aren't
they
what
you
mean
to
say
these
parks
with
just
benches
and
places
like
fort
square,
are
they?”
answer;
“that
is
correct,”
so
that
the
facilities
which
were
desegregated
were
mainly
these
squares
with
statues.
in
fact,
one
of
them
is
i
think
a
little
strip
of
land
near
the
river
with
four
or
five
benches
and
they
call
that
a
park,
but
actually
it's
just
a
little
square
that's
been
desegregated.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes,
our
first
position
is
that
with
respect
to
public
recreation
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
--
there
is
no
need
for
the
delay
contemplated
by
this
court
in
the
second
brown
case
because
recreation
is
not
like
public
schools,
it's
like
desegregation
of
the
buses
and
those
have
been
desegregated
in
memphis
and
many
other
communities,
immediate
in
the
sense
of
immediate
here
of
course
doesn't
mean
tomorrow,
because
no
injunction
was
issued
for
ten
days
anyway
and
there
maybe
an
appeal
and
a
stay,
but
what
we
mean
is
that,
that
it
should
not
be
applied
to
this
area,
this
gradualism,
which
is
developed
with
respect
to
school
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
no
gradualism
at
all
is
our
first
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes
sir,
yes
that's
correct.
and
what
they're
attempting
to
do
here
really
is
to
apply
gradualism
to
the
area
of
recreation
such
as
now
has
developed
with
respect
to
the
school.
now,
mr.
prewitt
also
said
that
the
district
court
has
not
acted
on
their
plan
because
that
his
hands
were
stayed.
now,
that
seems
to
imply
that
we
applied
for
a
stay
of
the
district
court's
order
or
somebody
did,
but
there
was
no
stay
here.
and
of
course,
an
appeal
does
not
automatically
stay
proceedings
in
the
district
court
and
it
is
my
understanding
that
that
plan
has
not
been
filed
with
the
district
court,
the
ten-year
plan.
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
it
has
not
been
filed
in
the
district
court,
but
as
i
said
before,
the
sixth
circuit
has
looked
at
it
and
now
this
court
has
it
because
they
say
it's
a
public
document,
everybody
knows
what
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
that's
right.
yes
that's
absolutely
correct.
now,
the
point
of
--
ms.
constance
b.
motley
yes
sir,
that's
what
it
is.
now
as
to
the
more
supervisors
--
i
think
the
answer
to
that
was
there
--
desegregation
is
that,
if
20,000
new
white
children
should
move
into
memphis
as
the
sixth
circuit
said
in
the
clemens
case,
the
local
authorities
would
take
care
of
that
and
they
would
provide
more
supervisors
or
whatever
is
required
to
accommodate
an
additional
increase
in
white
children.
and
the
other
thing
is
that
there
is
more
confusion
now
as
a
result
of
this
gradualism
and
not
less
because
negroes
are
not
advised
when
these
parks
are
desegregated,
they
don't
know
which
park
they
can
go
in
and
as
the
record
says,
you
don't
know
until
you
go
there
and
the
policeman
doesn't
chase
you
and
you
can
go.
so,
this
has
resulted
in
more
confusion
rather
than
less.
thank
you.
