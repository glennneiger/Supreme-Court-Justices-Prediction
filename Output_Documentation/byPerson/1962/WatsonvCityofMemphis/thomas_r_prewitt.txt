mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
a
preliminary,
i
should
allude
to
this
fact,
because
i
don't
believe
that
mrs.
motley
has.
the
department
of
justice
has
filed
the
brief
amicus
curiae
in
this
cause
as
of
february
the
7th.
we
did
not
know
about
this
until
last
thursday,
when
one
of
the
members
in
the
solicitor
general's
office
called
me
in
memphis
and
advised
me
of
that
fact
and
we
have
received
the
brief
amicus
curiae
of
the
government
on
last
friday.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
do
not
make
that
statement
in
any
criticism
and
we
do
not
ask
for
any
additional
time
within
which
to
answer
the
propositions
raised
by
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
because
i
believe
that
our
argument
in
response
to
the
petitioner's
would
be
substantially
the
same.
in
other
words,
in
our
judgment,
the
brief
of
the
government
raises
no
substantial
new
questions,
but
i
did
want
to
make
that
reference
to
the
court.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
thank
you,
sir.
this,
i
think
we
should
get
the
record
clear
to
determine
just
what
the
question
is
presented
on
this
record.
the
question
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
purely
and
simply
a
question
of
law
in
our
court,
whether
the
decision
in
the
second
school
desegregation
case,
brown
against
board
of
education,
which
contemplates
allowing
a
delay
in
the
desegregation
of
public
elementary
and
secondary
schools
is
applicable
in
an
action
involving
public
recreational
facilities.
that
was
the
question
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals.
that
was
the
question
which
the
court
of
appeals
decided.
that
was
the
question
specifically
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
now
filed
in
this
cause.
but
now,
we
are
faced
with
an
additional
question,
may
it
please
the
court,
not
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals,
not
presented
on
the
petition
for
certiorari
to
it
under
the
facts
of
this
case
after
viewing
the
record
as
a
whole,
was
there
any
justification
for
the
delay
permitted
by
the
trial
judge?
in
other
words,
that
question
involves
a
determination
of
the
whole
record
in
this
case.
it
wouldn't
involve
necessarily
an
analysis
of
all
the
facts
and
all
the
evidence
below
and
that
question
was
not
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
was
not
presented
on
petition
for
certiorari.
notwithstanding
that,
i
do
feel
that
i
should
allude
to
the
facts
and
as
far
as
i
can
show
that
the
burden
cast
upon
us
was
met
below
--
was
met
both
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
yes
sir,
court
of
appeals
did
review
the
district
court's
discretion,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
had
before
it
the
question
of
whether
or
not
--
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
--
in
a
case
involving
public
recreational
facilities,
the
rule
as
announced
in
the
brown
case
was
applicable.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
because
if
your
honor
please,
if
the
second
question
presented
that
is
whether
or
not
the
burden
cast
on
the
public
authorities
was
met,
it
would
require
an
analysis
of
the
whole
record.
the
old
record
isn't
here.
the
testimony
of
the
some
of
the
important
witnesses
below
is
not
here
and
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
that
we
have
here
a
question
of
law
and
that
is;
are
the
principles
of
equity
announced
in
the
second
brown
decision,
which
permit
of
some
delay
in
the
desegregation
of
public
school
facilities.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
yes,
i
agree
with
the
court
that
there
has
to
be
some
analysis
of
the
facts.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
the
court
of
appeals
did
consider
the
facts
to
determine
whether
or
not
in
a
case
involving
public
recreational
facilities,
the
rule
in
the
brown
case
is
applicable,
to
that
extent
the
court
did
consider
those
facts.
my
point
is
that
if
we
are
to
go
into
all
of
the
facts
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
burden
of
proof
as
is
required
in
the
brown
case
was
met,
it
would
require
a
consideration
of
all
of
the
evidence
and
all
of
the
evidence
is
not
here.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
yes
sir,
your
honor
please.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
yes
sir,
because
i
believe
those
facts
are
adequate
to
determine
the
question
before
the
court
whether
or
not
the
rule
announced
in
the
second
brown
decision,
permitting
some
delay
in
the
desegregation
of
public
schools
is
applicable
to
a
system
involving
public
recreation.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
the
testimony
of
the
superintendent
of
education
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
marin
hill
is
not
in
this
record.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
because
it
wasn't
printed,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petition
for
certiorari
--
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
i
do
not
know.
i
would
assume
that
it
is
--
it's
a
typewritten
record.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
now
addressing
myself,
if
your
honor
please,
to
the
question
presented
here,
is
the
rule
that
this
court
announced
in
the
brown
case
that
permits
of
some
delay
in
the
desegregation
of
public
education
facilities
applicable
here.
if
that
rule
is
limited
to
public
education
then
the
petitioners
are
right.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
if
this
court
intended
that
the
--
all
deliberate
speed
formula
be
limited
to
cases
involving
public
education,
then
of
course
the
petitioners
are
correct.
we
say
that
it
should
not
be
so
limited
and
that
it
should
be
not
so
limited
in
this
case.
now,
i
believe,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
a
statement
of
some
of
the
facts
that
were
not
covered
by
my
adversary
is
proper.
we
are
not
dealing
here,
may
it
please
the
court,
with
an
isolated
facility
or
even
a
group
of
facilities.
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
vast
system
of
public
recreation
in
a
city
of
a
half
a
million
people,
130
public
parks,
117
supervised
playgrounds,
56
of
which
are
on
school
and
church
properties.
these
117
playgrounds
are
each
staffed
by
trained
supervisors
who
afford
a
supervised
system
of
play
for
what
the
proof
shows
is
100,000
children,
35,000
i
believe
colored
and
65,000
white.
the
proof
shows
that
this
system
of
supervised
play
is
one
of
the
finest
in
the
country.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
substantially.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
i
believe
the
proof
is
that
from
the
1960
census,
the
percentage
was
37%
colored
and
63%
white,
so
it's
substantially
the
same.
in
addition
to
that,
the
recreational
facilities
include
a
number
of
things,
which
are
not
troublesome.
there
are
seven
golf
courses,
i
believe
12
community
centers,
a
public
zoo,
an
art
gallery,
a
boat
dock,
and
some
ten
swimming
pools.
i
haven't
covered
all
of
the
facilities,
but
substantially
that
is
it.
the
greatest
problem
is
in
the
area
of
the
117
public
playgrounds,
where
there
are
supervisors
to
supervise
the
play
of
all
of
these
children.
now,
the
undisputed
proof
and
incidentally
and
may
it
please
the
court,
none
of
the
proof
offered
by
the
park
commission
was
disputed.
the
only
proof
offered
by
the
petitioners
and
there
was
no
question
about
it,
was
that
in
each
instance
where
one
of
the
petitioners
sought
to
use
a
golf
course
and
incidentally
all
of
the
golf
courses
except
one
have
now
been
desegregated,
but
where
they
sought
to
use
the
golf
course
or
the
fairgrounds
or
whatever
facility
it
might
have
been,
they
were
rejected.
in
each
case
now
all
of
those
facilities
have
now
been
desegregated.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
all
of
the
golf
courses,
except
one.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
that,
may
it
please
the
court,
was
on
the
basis
of
a
plan
that
was
submitted
to
the
trial
court
for
a
gradual
desegregation
of
the
seven
golf
courses.
at
the
time
this
case
came
to
trial,
there
were
five
golf
courses
for
white
and
two
for
colored.
the
proof
was
that
the
officials
in-charge,
after
making
their
investigation,
determined
that
the
best
way
to
remove
the
restrictions
on
the
golf
courses
was
to
do
it
on
a
gradual
basis
and
that
plan
was
started
and
it
is
now
almost
complete.
a
plan
as
i
say
was
submitted
to
the
trial
court
and
approved
with
respect
to
the
golf
courses
and
with
respect
to
other
facilities.
while
i
am
on
that,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
plan
as
submitted
to
the
trial
court
for
gradual
desegregation
did
not
embrace
all
of
the
facilities,
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
the
trial
court
ordered
the
park
commission
to
submit
a
complete
plan
within
six
months,
but
before
the
plan
could
be
submitted,
the
petitioners
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals,
thereby
staying
the
hand
of
the
trial
court.
the
plan
was
evolved,
submitted
to
the
trial
court
and
it
was
not
filed
because
of
the
suggestion
of
the
court,
because
its
hand
was
stayed.
it
was
printed
in
the
public
press
so
that
all
the
world
had
notice
of
it.
it
was
given
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
their
request,
the
petitioners
had
the
plan
when
it
was
submitted
to
the
public
press
and
the
plan
has
been
carried
out.
and
in
fact,
in
several
instances
it
has
been
accelerated.
now,
i
am
not
here
to
say
that
this
plan
is
adequate.
it
may
not
be
ten
years
maybe
too
long,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
trial
court
has
never
had
an
opportunity
to
adjudicate
with
reference
to
this
plan
because
the
appeal
was
taken
before
the
court
had
an
opportunity
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
adequate
or
whether
or
not
it
was
the
best
plan,
but
i
feel
that
we
have
gone
as
far
as
we
can
with
respect
to
a
complete
plan.
so,
that's
the
status
of
the
six-month
plan,
but
if
i
might
go
on
further.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
it
was
published
in
the
two
newspapers
in
memphis.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
certainly,
it
was
made
available
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
have
it
here.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
i
will
your
honor,
but
to
go
on
further
with
the
proof
below,
there
are
117
public
staffed
supervised
playgrounds.
56
of
these
playgrounds
are
on
school
and
church
properties.
a
number
of
the
playgrounds
are
on
parochial
school
properties.
the
park
commission
has
felt
that
since
it
is
an
important
facet
in
the
memphis
community
that
its
program
of
desegregation
in
compliance
with
the
rule
in
the
brown
case
should
be
carried
out
in
coordination
with
all
other
activities
in
memphis.
over
the
last
four
or
five
years,
there
have
been
many
steps
toward
desegregation
of
public
and
private
facilities,
including
the
schools,
the
public
transportation
system,
the
public
terminals
many,
many
things
that
i
could
allude
to
here.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
i
am
not
prepared
to
answer
that,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
the
city
attorney
is
here,
may
it
please
the
court,
and
i
would
prefer
--
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
your
honor
i
believe
you
asked
me
to
check
in
the
[inaudible]
of
the
number
of
colored
children
that
are
now
attending
desegregated
schools
in
the
city
of
memphis
and
i
have
that
information.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
there
are
presently
63
colored
school
children
attending
desegregated
schools
in
the
city
of
memphis.
the
program
of
desegregation
was
commenced
in
the
fall
of
1961
with
the
first
grade
and
in
the
fall
of
1962
the
second
and
third
grades
were
desegregated.
these
63
school
children
do
not
include
an
undetermined
number
of
colored
children
who
were
assigned
to
the
desegregated
schools,
but
who
asked
to
be
reassigned
to
all
colored
schools.
i
don't
have
that
number,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
might
state
this
with
respect
to
the
schools
because
it
does
have
considerable
relevancy
here
that
on
may
the
22nd
next
there
is
scheduled
a
hearing
in
the
district
court
at
memphis.
both
the
board
of
education
and
the
naacp
have
presented
proposed
plans
for
further
integration
of
the
public
schools.
under
the
naacp
plan,
the
first
six
grades
would
be
integrated
this
fall
and
seven,
eight,
and
nine
in
the
fall
of
1964
and
the
remaining
grades
in
the
fall
of
1965.
under
the
board
of
education
plan,
the
first
four
grades
would
be
integrated
this
year
and
then
one
grade
a
year
here
after
until
the
program
is
terminated.
so
that
is
the
situation
with
respect
to
schools.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
now
with
respect
to
the
parochial
school
and
that
has
some
relevance
because
the
park
commission
operates
playgrounds
on
parochial
school
property.
bishop
adrian
of
nashville
has
recently
announced
that
the
parochial
schools
in
tennessee
would
commence
their
program
of
desegregation
this
fall
on
a
gradual
basis.
now,
up
to
address
myself
to
the
problem
at
hand,
the
recreational
facilities
of
the
city
of
memphis.
the
undisputed
proof
shows
these
facts,
may
it
please
the
court
that
56
of
the
117
supervised
playgrounds,
which
accommodate
100,000
children
in
supervised
play,
are
on
school
and
church
property.
the
park
commission
in
its
thinking
and
in
evolving
its
plan
with
respect
to
complying
with
the
brown
case
felt
that
it
would
not
be
wise
to
desegregate
the
playgrounds
on
the
church
properties
and
the
school
properties
until
those
institutions
themselves
were
desegregated.
it
was
thought
that
that
would
not
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
people
as
a
whole.
yes
sir?
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
no
sir,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
not
all
of
it,
if
your
honor
please,
some
of
it.
for
instance
basketball
takes
place
in
the
school
gymnasiums.
of
course
baseball
would
take
place
on
the
school
playgrounds.
most
of
it
would
take
place
after
school
hours,
but
much
of
the
supervised
play
would
take
place
during
the
school
terms.
a
great
portion
of
it
of
course
takes
place
in
the
summer
time.
and
i
would
judge
that
the
greater
percentage
of
the
supervised
play
does
take
place
in
the
summer
time
when
the
schools
are
not
in
session.
but
with
respect
to
basketball
and
baseball
and
other
activities
the
recreational
activity
does
take
place
during
the
school
time.
now,
the
proof
also
shows
this,
may
it
please
the
court,
with
respect
to
all
of
the
117
playgrounds
that
if
the
relief
sought
here
is
granted
and
all
of
the
playgrounds
are
desegregated
at
the
same
time
that
the
supervisory
staff
that
now
supervises
the
play
of
these
100,000
children
will
not
be
adequate
and
that
more
supervisors
will
have
to
be
trained
and
employed
to
give
proper
supervision
and
proper
protection
to
these
children
during
this
transition
period,
it's
contemplated.
the
necessary
result
of
that,
may
it
please
the
court,
would
be
that
a
large
number
of
children
would
not
receive
the
benefits
of
supervised
play
that
they
are
now
receiving
and
the
park
commission
feels
that
that
is
tremendously
important
thing
for
all
of
the
people
of
memphis,
especially
to
keep
the
children
off
the
streets
during
the
summer
vacation
period.
and
i
don't
believe
that
i
need
any
citation
of
authority
otherwise
to
demonstrate
how
important
that
is
to
any
city.
this
playground
system
of
memphis,
we
feel,
is
one
of
the
finest
in
the
country
and
we
feel
that
it
has
been
developed
over
a
period
of
years
to
the
point
where
it
is
one
of
the
most
important
facets
of
our
community
life.
we
recognize,
may
it
please
the
court
that
we
must
comply
with
the
established
law
that
all
of
the
playgrounds
must
be
open
to
all
children
colored
and
white,
but
we
feel
that
additional
time
yet
is
necessary,
recognizing
that
it
has
been
eight
years
since
the
brown
decision.
but
we
feel
that
experience
has
shown
that
where
this
program
can
be
developed
on
a
gradual
basis
without
an
injunction
hanging
over
the
heads
of
our
people
and
authority
that
we
can
develop
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
not
create
confusion
or
disarray
and
will
give
protection
and
supervision
to
all
of
these
children.
the
park
commission
certainly
from
the
concurrent
finding
of
both
lower
courts
has
acted
in
unquestioned
good
faith
in
trying
to
carry
out
what
we
felt
was
the
law
as
announced
in
the
second
brown
decision.
but
we
feel
that
some
additional
time
is
necessary,
bearing
in
the
mind
that
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
the
lower
courts
had
any
discretion
save
to
issue
an
immediate
injunction.
the
adequacy
of
the
plan
that
i
filed
on
yesterday,
the
adequacy
of
any
plan
has
never
been
presented
to
the
district
court
or
to
the
court
of
appeals.
this
appeal
was
taken
before
we
had
an
opportunity
to
allow
the
district
judge
to
adjudicate
with
respect
to
the
full
plan.
and
as
i
stated
yesterday,
we
don't
say
that
this
plan
that
we've
got
enough
is
the
magic
answer
or
that
it
will
be
adequate
or
that
it
will
be
sufficient.
it
is
the
best
plan
that
we've
been
able
to
devise
and
we
feel
that
the
district
judge
should
have
an
opportunity
to
adjudicate
with
respect
to
that
plan
and
if
it
is
inadequate
to
accelerate
it
or
to
take
what
other
steps
might
be
necessary,
that's
our
position.
if
they
--
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
if
your
honor
please
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
would
take
issue
with
counsel
on
her
statement.
i
can't
tell
you
how
many
of
the
130
i
believe
parks
and
117
playgrounds
have
been
desegregated.
i
will
try
to
give
you
now
some
of
the
facilities
that
have
been
desegregated.
six
of
the
seven
public
golf
courses,
crump
stadium,
which
was
alluded
to,
has
been
desegregated.
the
public
zoo,
the
fairground,
the
lake
boat
dock
and
several,
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
exactly
how
many,
several
playgrounds
have
already
been
desegregated.
several
were
desegregated
last
year
and
the
program
calls
for
additional
desegregation
this
year.
but
many,
many
parks
and
many,
many
facilities
have
been
desegregated
under
the
plan
that's
already
been
evolved.
and
the
park
commission
is
complying
with
--
yes
sir,
counsel
reminds
me
that
all
the
tennis
courts
have
been
desegregated.
and
i
am
safe
in
making
this
statement
that
there
is
no
activity
sponsored
by
the
park
commission
which
is
not
now
open
to
both
races.
there
is
no
as
distinguished
from
a
particular
playground
at
a
particular
place.
there
are
many
playgrounds
which
are
still
segregated.
most
of
them
are
neighborhood
playgrounds,
but
there
is
no
activity
now
except
the
pink
palace
museum
and
it
stands
in
a
different
light
and
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
going
to
be
a
significant
problem.
in
fact
i
think
that
it
is
very
minor
when
considered
in
the
light
of
the
whole
program.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
yes,
it
is
being
--
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
no
sir
it's
been
accelerated,
in
several
different
instances.
for
instance
i
believe
winchester
park
on
the
program
was
to
be
desegregated
in
1965
and
that
has
already
been
desegregated.
it
was
desegregated
in
1962.
there
are
other
instances
of
that
type
where
the
program
has
been
accelerated
and
it
will
be
accelerated,
but
we
feel
that
it
is
difficult
to
plan
ahead
on
a
program
as
vast
as
this.
we
recognize
the
problem
and
as
time
goes
on
and
the
park
commission
we
believe
will
be
able
to
make
judgments
as
situations
come
up
and
accelerate
the
program
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
if
your
honor
please,
as
i
stated
earlier
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question
yesterday,
the
board
of
education
proposes
to
desegregate
the
fourth
grade
this
year
and
then
one
grade
each
year
thereafter.
the
plan
submitted
by
the
naacp
would
accomplish
complete
desegregation
of
the
schools
by
1965.
the
district
judge
has
not
yet
ruled
with
respect
to
the
two
plans
concerning
the
school
system.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
if
the
plan
submitted
by
the
end
of
--
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
if
the
plan
that
we
have
already
presented
to
the
public
press
is
the
final
plan,
but
the
trial
court
has
never
had
an
opportunity
to
even
consider
that
plan.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
you
mean
parks
that
were
formally
undeveloped,
is
that
what
you...
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
i
think
i
can
answer
that
yes,
if
your
honor
please,
that
they
have
opened
up
new
parks,
which
are
now
desegregated.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
if
your
honor
please,
the
only
answer
i
can
give
to
that
is
that
the
new
parks
as
well
as
the
old
parks
have
to
be
considered
as
part
of
the
overall
system
and
the
plan
for
desegregation
takes
into
account
all
of
the
system,
including
new
parks
as
well
as
the
old
parks
and
the
program
that
we
are
trying
to
evolve
will
result
of
course
in
desegregation
of
all
the
parks.
in
all
candor,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
can
add
very
little
or
detract
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i
feel
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
analyzed
the
evidence
presented
below,
has
concurred
in
the
findings
of
the
fact
of
the
trial
court,
and
has
stated
our
position
far
better
than
i
can
state
it.
we
feel
that
since
both
lower
courts
found
that
the
park
commission
acted
in
unquestioned
good
faith
and
that
more
time
was
necessary
in
order
to
accomplish
an
orderly
desegregation
of
this
vast
recreational
system,
that
the
trial
judge
was
not
in
error
in
refusing
to
issue
an
injunction,
which
would
order
massive
desegregation
of
every
recreational
facility
in
the
city
of
memphis.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
no
sir,
they
were
entered.
if
the
record
reflects
only
a
copy
then
this
record
is
in
error.
the
findings
of
facts
of
the
lower
court
are
in
the
record
at
page
91.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
that
is
the
fault
of
the
printer,
may
it
please
the
court
and
not
the
fault
of
the
district
court.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
that
is
the
judgment.
now
i
do
not
know
why
they
printed
a
record
doesn't
have
a
signed
copy,
but
it
is
the
judgment
of
the
court
and
i
have
learned
today
that
the
typewritten
record
is
here,
so
that
i'm
sure
it
will
reflect
the
signature
of
the
judge.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
marion
boyd,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
judge
boyd
approved
a
partial
plan,
may
it
please
the
court,
with
respect
to
the
golf
courses,
fairgrounds,
amusement
park
and
a
few
other
facilities
that
are
specifically
listed.
he
further
ordered
the
park
commission
to
submit
a
complete
plan
within
six
months
and
before
that
six-month
period
expired
the
appeal
was
taken.
so
that
he
has
never
had
an
opportunity
to
rule
on
the
adequacy
of
the
complete
plan.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
certainly
not,
because
no
plan
has
ever
been
presented
to
the
court
other
than
the
partial
plan
with
respect
to
the
golf
courses
and
fairgrounds
and
amusement
parks,
and
the
tennis
courts,
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
that's
correct
your
honor
please
if
the
plan
that
we've
submitted
is
inadequate
then
the
court
necessarily
will
do
something
about
it.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
if
your
honor
please,
i
believe
that
if
the
board
of
education
plan
is
approved
it
will
--
the
time
they'll
need
for
desegregation
will
be
about
the
same
time,
yes
sir.
well
both
programs
were
commenced
at
about
the
same
time.
your
honor
is
correct,
that
if
the
naacp
plan
is
approved
then
there
--
it
would
be
on
earlier
date
and
i
think
that
might
very
well
have
a
considerable
bearing
on
what
the
trial
court
should
do
with
respect
to
the
park
system.
it's
hard
to
separate
the
two,
they
are
so
enmeshed.
they
even
--
the
park
commission
and
the
board
of
education
even
operate
out
of
the
same
building
now.
it's
very
difficult
to
consider
the
two
things
separately
because
actually
we
are
talking
about
the
same
children
because
they
have
the
same
children,
the
same
children
go
to
school
to
play
on
the
playgrounds,
and
the
two
systems--
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
that's
correct
your
honor
please
and
we
feel
that
that
strengthens
our
position,
because
the
participation
on
the
playgrounds
is
voluntary
and
we
certainly
don't
want
to
create
a
situation
which
would
discourage
that
voluntary
participation.
we
want
to
make
the
playground
system
attractive
to
the
children
so
that
they
will
avail
themselves
of
the
benefits
of
it.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
to
some
extent
yes,
i
think
that's
true
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
yes
sir,
but
may
it
please
the
court,
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
based
on
that
fact.
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
if
the
release
sought
here
is
granted
many
more
supervisors
will
be
necessary
to
supervise
these
100,000
children
and
that
many
children
that
now
enjoy
the
benefits
of
supervised
play
will
be
deprived
of
that.
that
was
the
basis,
not
that
the
community
feeling
was
against
it.
of
course
i
would
be
naïve
even
if
i
stood
in
front
of
this
court
and
said
that
the
white
people
of
memphis
were
all
for
integration,
but
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
take
into
account
any
hostility
in
rendering
its
opinion.
it
was
based
upon
other
factors
that
we
feel
are
legitimate
factors
under
the
brown
decision.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
if
your
honor
please
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
birmingham
or
montgomery
i'm
not
sure,
ruled,
gilmore
against
montgomery,
ruled
that
the
second
brown
decision
applied
to
public
parks
and
in
the
city
of
charleston
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
ruled
not
that
the
brown
case
applied,
but
that
delay
would
be
authorized
in
if
there
was
a
proof
to
justify.
in
the
south
carolina
case,
there
was
only
one
facility
involved,
the
public
golf
course.
they
weren't
considering
a
system,
an
entire
recreational
system.
those
are
the
only
two
cases
that
i
know
about
that
cover
this
specific
question.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
all
right
if
your
honor
please
let's
take
a
park
that
accommodates
800
children,
that
would
be
an
average,
because
there
are
100,000
children
to
be
--
that
are
involved
in.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
i
am
told
that
the
average
park
requires
two
to
four
supervisors
to
supervise
the
play.
until
last
year
there
were
no
integrated
playground
situations.
where
that
situation
has
changed
and
instead
of
having
children
of
all
of
one
race,
but
are
mixed
for
the
first
time
the
feeling
of
the
people
in-charge,
the
superintendent
of
recreation
and
the
director
of
parks
based
upon
trouble
already
experienced
on
the
public
buses
and
at
the
zoo
where
additional
protection
was
needed
to
the
public,
based
upon
actual
experience,
they
testified
that
more
supervisors
than
two
to
four
in
the
park
in
question
would
be
needed
to
protect
those
800
children.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
that
was
winchester
and
i
believe
the
basic
reason
for
that
was
that
the
character
of
the
neighborhood
had
changed
more
rapidly
than
the
--
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
no,
because
the
character
of
the
neighborhood
was
such
that
once
it
was
open
to
both
races,
only
the
colored
children
participated.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
you
have
the
facts
that
where
other
facilities
have
been
desegregated
mr.
justice
white,
such
as
the
public
buses
and
the
public
zoo
that
additional
protection
was
needed.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
yes
sir
and
i
don't
think
there
is
a
slightest
doubt
about
it.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
very
little
trouble
with
the
tennis
courts,
very
little
trouble,
may
it
please
the
court,
with
the
golf
courses,
very
little
trouble
actually
at
the
zoo,
but
in
dealing
with
the
playgrounds
such
vast
numbers
of
children,
it's
the
feeling
of
the
people
in-charge
who
lived
in
memphis
all
of
their
life
that,
that
is
a
much
more
sensitive
area
and
it
is
an
area
in
which
we
need
more
additional
time.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
i
mentioned,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
zoo
and
the
public
transportation
system
as
two
examples
of
where
there
was
confusion
and
turmoil.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
there
have
been,
as
i
mentioned
the
playground
to
mr.
justice
white,
but
because
of
the
character
of
the
neighborhood,
the
participation
by
the
white
children
ceased
upon
the
integration,
but
there
are
many
neighborhoods
where
that
situation
will
be
not
be
true.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
there
are
three,
i
believe
your
honor
please,
there
are
either
three
that
are
already
desegregated
or
that
will
be
that
--
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
the
only
one
i
can
think
of
is
that
has
already
been
desegregated
is
winchester.
two
more
are
on
--
are
planned
immediately.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
probably
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
we
feel
that
those
should
be
desegregated
after
such
parks
as
winchester.
that
the
plan
contemplates
that
park
such
as
winchester
should
be
first
desegregated
and
that
other
parks
where
there
will
be
more
--
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
we
submitted
it
to
the
court,
but
the
court
would
not
consider
it.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
all
i
can
say
your
honor
please,
the
winchester
playground
has
been
desegregated.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
i
cannot
since
it's
a
voluntary
program,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
i
don't
understand
exactly
what
the
court
--
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
your
honor
please,
our
plan
contemplates
desegregation
of
all
117
--
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
if
our
plan
that
has
been
submitted
to
the
court,
but
has
not
been
filed
but
which
has
been
published
is
adopted,
the
playground
will
desegregated
on
a
staggered
basis
until
1971
when
at
which
time
all
of
the
playgrounds
will
be
desegregated.
i
cannot
answer
your
honor's
question
that
in
1965
our
playground
number
25
will
be
desegregated
and
in
that
area,
the
population
is
50-50.
i
just
don't
know,
but
it's
a
gradual
program
over
a
period
of
the
next
seven
or
eight
years
until
1971,
taking
around
six
or
seven
playgrounds
a
year
or
whatever
is
required.
we
haven't
attempted
to
gerrymander
this
proposition,
but
we
have
--
the
park
commission
has
attempted
to
desegregate
areas
which
will
be
less
troublesome
first.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
well,
as
i
say,
it's
a
voluntary
participation,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
well,
if
your
honor
please,
my
answer
–
i
will
try
to
answer
the
court's
question
in
this
way.
actually,
there
is
no
segregation
in
housing
in
memphis
as
such.
that
is,
there
is
no
one
particular
area
in
memphis
where
there
are
only
colored
people
and
other
areas
where
there
are
only
white
people.
they
are
intermingled
and
scattered
over
the
whole
city.
this
plan
of
desegregation
would
desegregate
these
various
parks
and
playgrounds
over
a
six
to
seven-year
period
until
1971.
and
i
can't
answer
your
honor's
question
by
saying
that
when
the
park
number
25
is
desegregated
that
only
white
people
or
only
colored
people
will
appear
there.
mr.
thomas
r.
prewitt
that
was
not
the
basic
reason.
the
reason
was
that
the
neighborhood
around
this
particular
park
was
almost
entirely
colored.
the
white
people
can
participate
there
if
they
wish,
it's
a
voluntary
situation.
that's
about
all
i
can
say,
your
honor
please.
again,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
question
herein
involved
is
whether
or
not
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
any
discretion
save
to
issue
an
immediate
injunction
that
was
the
only
issue
there,
it's
the
only
issue
before
this
court
and
if
we
are
inadequate
in
our
plans
then
that
can
be
corrected
and
the
trial
judge
will
correct
it,
i'm
sure.
