there
will
still
be
the
same
100,000
children
to
be
serviced
whether
the
parks
are
segregated
or
desegregated
and
how
is
that
that
they
will
take
more
supervisors
in
the
event
of
desegregation,
in
a
particular
park?
just
take
and
pick
one
of
the
parks
you
are
familiar
with
and
give
us
an
example.
justice
byron
r.
white
we'll
take
a
specific
park
with
which
you
are
familiar.
you
don't
need
to
deal
with
averages
and
figures.
you
know
of
a
park
there,
just
speak
of
one
that
is
now
segregated
and
tell
us
about
how
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that's
the
testimony,
but
why
are
they
needed.
i
know
that's
somebody's
opinion,
but
what
are
the
--
now
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
some
parks,
some
playground
that
was
schedule
to
be
desegregated
in
1965
was
desegregated
in
1962,
which
park
was
that
whether
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
you
need
more
supervisors
in
that
park
when
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
was
--
what
is
your,
is
that
just
--
do
we
have
the
facts
in
the
record
as
to
why
more
supervisors
would
be
needed
or
just
someone's
opinion
would
be
prevalent?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
are
you
saying
that
if
you
only
desegregate
a
park
and
you
have
a
mixture
of
the
races,
there
is
going
to
be
just
more
fights
or
more
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
will
is
it
--
are
there
any
other
public
playgrounds
that
are
desegregated
other
than
the
winchester?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
that
the
ones
that
are
already
segregated
–
desegregated?
you
say
there
are
three
of
those
or
only
–
there
are
only
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
know
what
--
are
these
in
the
neighborhoods
similar
to
those
of
the
winchester?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
you
would
anticipate
that
there
will
be
colored
children
in
the
end
result
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
have
no
plans
in
any
neighborhood
this
time
to
desegregate
a
park
where
there
actually
in
a
--
were
after
the
so
called
desegregation
there
would
be
both
races
on
the
playground.
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
submitted
your
plan
yet
in
the
district
court
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
that
plan
that
you
submitted,
when
is
the
first
--
when
will
be
the
first
park
or
the
first
playground
that
is
--
when
is
that
scheduled
for
desegregation
where
you
know
there
will
be
a
mixture
of
the
races
after
the
so
called
desegregation,
what
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
you
know
that
--
and
why
the
other
two
you've
got
plans,
you
anticipated
only
colored
children
will
be
playing
in
that
park?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
you
said
a
while
ago
there
are
other
neighborhoods
where
this
will
not
take
place
after
desegregation
and
that
there
actually
will
be
a
mixture.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
the
--
you've
--
if
the
only
park
that
have
been
desegregated
or
that
are
going
to
be
desegregated
are
the
ones
in
the
winchester
type
neighborhood,
there
going
to
be
required
no
further
supervisors
because
there
only
be
colored
children
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
i
know
it,
but
i
want
to
--
i
would
like
to
when
is
the
year
--
in
what
year
do
you
plan
desegregation
of
the
park
where
in
a
neighborhood
not
like
the
winchester
park?
