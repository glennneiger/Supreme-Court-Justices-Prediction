potter
stewart
these
are
three
alternative
arguments?
justice
potter
stewart
getting
less
and
less
extreme
--
justice
potter
stewart
are
they
parks
or
playgrounds
or
are
they
both?
justice
potter
stewart
and
quite
a
highly
organized
playground
program
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
does
you
lawsuit
involve
those
40
playgrounds
too?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understood
you
to
say
that
these
40
playgrounds
are
not
publicly
owned?
justice
potter
stewart
just
one
day
a
week
plan
for
the
pink
palace,
is
this
on
a
segregated
basis
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
that
one
day
a
week
to
both,
to
all
races?
justice
potter
stewart
and
white
people
are
not
allowed
to
go?
justice
potter
stewart
the
staffs
or
the
playground
supervisors,
is
that
an
integrated
staff?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
--
what's
the
school
situation
in
memphis
now
as
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
number
really
accurately
reflects
the
make
up
of
the
population
of
the
city
as
a
whole,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
all
of
which
all
the
golf
courses?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
prewitt,
you've
emphasized
several
times
that
the
--
in
your
view
the
only
question
before
this
court
now
is
whether
any
delay
at
all
is
permissible
in
--
with
respect
to
park
and
playground
system
as
contracted
--
as
contrasted
with
a
school
system
and
that
no
particular
plan
is
before
us.
is
that
what
i
understand?
justice
potter
stewart
i've
been
looking
through
the
record
and
i
can't
seem
to
find
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
one
affirming
the
district
court,
but
there
is
lots
of
--
there
are
some
conclusion
in
fact
in
law
with
no
signature
by
the
judge
on
it,
were
those
proposed
and
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
91
to
101.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
am
glancing
over
this
record
at
page
102
and
103,
it
appears
that
the
--
that
judge
boyd
approved
a
specific
plan
and
a
specific
timetable,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
so
his
basic
judgment
and
as
you
submitted
it
was
simply
denying
an
injunction,
a
prayer
for
injunction,
which
would
have
required
the
immediate
total
desegregation
of
all
the
facilities.
and
it's
your
point
that
if
we
agree
with
you,
that
there
is
at
least
possibly
some
room
for
some
delay,
this
would
not
imply
the
approval
of
any
specific
plan
in
memphis
or
anywhere
else,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
motley,
it's
your
position
or
at
least
your
first
position
that
with
respect
to
a
park
and
a
playground
system,
there
is
no
room
for
any
delay
of
any
kind,
any
place
for
any
reason
in
delaying
the
compulsory
immediate
desegregation.
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
any
gradualism
at
all,
don't
you
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
area,
you
don't
mean
memphis,
you
mean
the
area
of
parks
and
playgrounds
anywhere
whether
it
be
memphis
or
jackson,
mississippi
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
plan
before
this
court,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
neither
been
approved
nor
disapproved
by
any
court?
