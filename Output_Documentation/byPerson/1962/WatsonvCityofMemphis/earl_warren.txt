chief
justice
earl

because
it's
used
as
a
public
park?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
dedication
was
to
the
use
of
caucasians
only?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
prewitt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
should
you
want
some
time
at
the
end
of
the
argument,
you
may
have
it
to
reply
to
the
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
question
wasn't
asked
in
a
vacuum,
was
it?
it
was
asked
in
the
light
of
the
facts
of
this
case
as
presented
to
the
district
court,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
the
court
did
consider
the
facts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
we
should
be
limited
just
to
those
facts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
facts
that
were
before
the
district
court
are
not
in
this
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
a
typewritten
record
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
there
is
a
typewritten
record,
then
the
testimony
of
the
superintendent
of
schools
would
be
in
it,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
suppose
it
would
be
--
could
be
considered
by
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
not
that
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
leave
it
with
the
clerk.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
children
are
in
it
--
negro
children
are
in
the
public
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
any
idea?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
we'll
recess
until
morning,
maybe
let's
find
out.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i.
watson
jr.,
et
al.,
petitioners
versus
city
of
memphis.
mr.
prewitt
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
very
much.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
prewitt
may
i
ask
you
this.
i
understood
mrs.
motley
to
say
that
practically
all
or
at
least
a
great
many
of
the
parts
that
you
have
desegregated
were
merely
little
squares
or
little
triangles
that,
where
they
had
a
statue
and
a
few
--
in
a
few
chair,
few
seats
that
people
could
sit
in.
is
that
the
fact
then
and
if
so
how
many
general
playgrounds
have
you
in
these
last
nine
years
desegregated
for
the
use
of
all
people?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
prewitt,
has
the
city
of
memphis
opened
up
any
new
parks
in
recent
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
all
of
those
been
opened
up
on
the
non-segregated
basis?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
know.
i
said
have
they
opened
any
any
new
parks?
i
don't
know
what
undeveloped
means,
but
have
they
opened
up
any
new
parks
for
use
of
the
people
of
memphis
during
recent
years,
and
if
so
have
those
that
they
have
opened
up
been
desegregated
or
have
they
been
segregated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
they
opened
any
of
that
have
remained
segregated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
why?
if
you
are
looking
for
a
plan
to
remedy
this
situation
and
to
give
these
people
their
rights,
why
do
you
buy
new
parks
and
segregate
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
children
must
go
to
school
they
need
not
go
to
the
playground.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you
are
continuing
an
existence
the
feeling
of
the
community
that
there
should
be
segregation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
least
in
the
brown
case
that
that
wasn't
a
justifiable
reason?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
you
desegregate
only
those
parks
that
because
of
the
type
of
the
neighborhood
will
only
be
used
by
negroes,
have
you
desegregated
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
was
asking
you
a
while
back
about
voluntary
participation
in
the
park
is
distinguished
from
attendance
of
public
schools
and
you
said
it
was
because
the
people
of
memphis
weren't
ready
to
accept
that
and
use
the
park
in
that
spirit,
that
cause
them
to
--
cause
your
authorities
to
do
what
they
are
doing
on
this
basis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
didn't
answer
that,
you
told
us
that
just
a
little
while
ago
that
the
reason
is
westchester
one
could
be
done
in
a
manner
that
it
was,
was
because
it
was
so
predominantly
colored
that
when
they
desegregated
it,
the
whites
wouldn't
go
there
and
therefore,
you
would
have
no
trouble?
