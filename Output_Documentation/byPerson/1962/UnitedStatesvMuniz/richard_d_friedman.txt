mr.
richard
d.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
muniz
who
i
represent
received
a
corrective
sentence
to
cure
him.
he
was
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
a
sick
person
and
was
sent
to
a
particular
type
of
institution
in
the
state
of
connecticut
operated
by
the
federal
government.
and
on
leaving
that
institution
to
which
he
was
sent
for
cure,
he
walked
through
the
gates
blind
for
life
in
one
eye
and
subject
through
the
physical
infirmities
that
the
sequel
of
skull
fracture
causes.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
the
nature
of
the
sentence
and
the
type
of
institution
was
one
way
was
expected
to
be
cured
from
his
addiction
to
narcotics.
the
nature
of
the
sentence
was
not
punitive
in
the
sense
that
a
sentence
generally
is
taken
to
be
but
rather
in
an
effort
to
have
him
in
this
environment
resist
the
temptation
to
use
drugs.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
he
had
been
convicted
for
narcotics
violation,
yes.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
under
narcotics
violation,
yes.
incidentally
the
government
in
the
district
court
in
connecticut
prosecuted
the
12
people
who
were
involved
in
the
assault
on
muniz.
now
the
government
would
disallow
this
--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
i
am
sorry.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
the
government
prosecuted
the
12
inmates
concerned
in
this
assault
situation
in
the
institution,
and
successfully
and
they
were
each
sentenced
to
the
maximum
sentence
or
most
of
them
were
sentenced
to
the
maximum
sentence
permissible
under
the
statute
which
was
the
basis
of
the
indictment.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
the
maximum
sentence
or
--
five
years
i
believe
was
the
maximum.
some
were
sentenced
--
i
think
the
least
was
two
years.
now
the
government
would
disallow
the
claim
by
muniz,
well,
why?
they
say
that
the
diversity
of
the
state
laws
create
a
lottery
and
that
the
state
laws
are
different
in
the
place
of
incarceration
of
an
inmate
should
not
determine
his
right
to
recover.
they
say
secondly,
to
permit
such
action
would
destroy
the
uniform
system
and
they
then
allude
to
the
disciplinary
problems
which
mr.
doolittle
has
expressed
great
concern
about.
we
disagree
with
the
government's
contention.
in
the
lower
court
briefs
and
here
and
in
winston's
brief,
and
the
government's
briefs,
all
of
the
cases
that
deal
with
these
situations
i
think
have
been
quite
fully
discussed,
but
we
have
become
convinced
on
behalf
of
muniz
that
the
heart
of
this
matter
involves
what
we
would
term
the
supremacy
of
federal
tort
law.
the
circumstances
of
this
case
are
peculiar,
they
are
peculiarly
federal
and
they
are
involved
in
a
situation
where
there
is
federal
law
which
has
uniformity
throughout
the
50
states
and
the
territories.
now
what
do
i
mean
by
that?
the
basis
of
the
muniz
claim
is
that
by
virtue
of
the
cited
statute
in
our
brief
creating
the
bureau
of
prisons
and
imposing
the
duties
upon
the
superintendent
of
prisons
and
the
bureau
to
safety
prisoners,
to
safeguard
those
being
held
for
arraignment
and
to
safeguard
the
welfare
of
material
witnesses.
those
are
the
duties
in
the
federal
statute.
incidentally
mr.
muniz
should
be
denied
recovery
here
then
so
must
you
deny
recovery
to
a
material
witness
who
was
in
custody
of
the
united
states
marshal,
perhaps
a
very
great
peril
to
himself
waiting
to
testify
in
a
case
involving
national
interest
because
the
duties
which
are
imposed
by
statute
upon
the
u.s
marshals
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
extend
to
material
witnesses
as
well
as
to
prisoners.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
no
sir,
i'm
not
asking
you
to
disregard
the
language
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
now,
this
is
the
one
of
the
main
points
that
we
make.
we
don't
incidentally
concede
in
this
case
that
the
law
of
connecticut
fails
to
give
us
a
cause
of
action,
we
claim
it
does.
but
we
say
that
the
words
in
the
tort
claims
act
law
of
the
place
mean
law
of
the
place,
it
does
not
say
law
of
the
state.
if
congress
had
wanted
to
use
the
words
mr.
justice
goldberg,
law
of
the
state,
the
choice
was
very
simple
for
congress
to
make.
and
so,
we
submit
that
under
the
position
taken
by
the
solicitor
general
today
that
if
the
little
words
law
of
the
place
means
law
of
the
state,
then
under
situations
where
there
is
an
act
of
negligence
occurring
in
a
federal
enclave
absent
a
specific
statute
making
state
law
applicable
the
federal
tort
claims
act
would
not
apply
on
a
federal
enclave
and
--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
well,
that
is
true
that
there
is
such
a
body
of
law,
but
we
would
submit
that
under
the
interpretation
expressed
by
the
government
in
its
brief
where
the
statutory
words
--
if
the
statutory
construction
in
the
tort
claims
act
is
to
be
confined
to
law
of
the
state,
then
where
a
state
may
not
have
a
particular
law
even
the
duties
which
are
imposed
under
the
statute
upon
the
bureau
of
prisons
would
have
no
applicability
and
there
could
be
no
cause
of
action
under
the
tort
claims
act
for
violation
of
a
duty
which
congress
had
imposed
upon
the
bureau
of
prisons
and
its
superintendent.
now,
we
allege
claim,
intend
that
the
federal
law
is
the
law
of
the
land,
that
this
federal
law
imposing
the
duty
upon
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
uniform
and
that
in
this
situation
that
it
is
the
law
or
duties
imposed
upon
the
bureau
of
prisons,
which
becomes
the
law
of
the
place
and
in
the
case
of
muniz,
connecticut.
and
that
beyond
the
point
relative
to
the
law
of
the
place,
i
might
say
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
plays
a
most
vital
part
in
our
argument,
because
over
50
years
ago
in
the
case
of
logan
against
the
united
states
in
144
u.s.
263,
the
court
had
said
prior
to
the
imposition
by
legislation
of
duties
upon
the
bureau
of
prisons
that
the
warden
and
that
the
prison
has
a
duty
of
safekeeping
and
safeguarding
a
prisoner
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
ahortly
thereafter
did
congress
enact
the
statute
imposing
the
very
duties
expressed
in
the
language
used
in
logan
against
the
united
states,
which
was
based
upon
the
constitution.
now,
we
say
that
denial
of
the
right
of
recovery
for
breach
of
the
duty
imposed
by
congress
negates
the
very
existence
of
the
duty
imposed
by
the
bureau
of
prisons.
the
government
in
this
particular
situation
has
assumed
the
burden
by
the
creation
of
its
uniform
system
of
taking
care
of
prisons
or
operating
prisons.
we
claim
that
the
existence
of
this
duty
gives
rise
to
a
remedy
and
that
one
who
has
the
duty
and
assumes
the
burden
must
perform
it
properly.
the
existence
of
our
comment
in
reference
to
federal
statutes
creating
a
federal
tort
law
maybe
found
to
be
supported
in
the
united
states
against
standard
oil
case
on
page
308
and
in
the
clearfield
trust
case,
which
the
government
cites
in
its
reply
brief.
and
on
page
308,
the
court
says,
“in
this
sense
therefore,
there
remains
what
may
be
termed
for
want
of
a
better
label,
an
area
of
federal
common
law
or
perhaps
more
accurately
law
of
independent
federal
decision
outside
the
constitutional
realm
untouched
by
the
erie
decision.
as
the
government
points
out,
this
has
been
demonstrated
broadly
not
only
by
the
clearfield
and
national
metropolitan
bank
cases,
but
also
by
other
decisions
rendered
here
since
the
erie
case
went
down.
whether
or
not
the
government
is
also
correct
in
saying
the
fact
was
foreshadowed
the
same
day
by
hinderlider
versus
la
plata
company
in
a
unanimous
opinion
delivered
likewise
by
mr.
justice
brandeis.
now
in
the
case
of
hess
against
the
united
states
and
hatahley
against
united
states
cited
in
our
brief.
the
hatahley
case
in
particular
makes
reference
to
an
act
i
believe
it's
called
a
national
grazing
act,
the
words
are
used
grazing
act,
this
is
an
act
which
applies
in
every
state
where
grazing
of
animals
takes
place
and
the
court
in
writing
its
opinion
says
that
this
is
a
matter
of
federal
concern.
this
is
a
law
which
is
uniform
over
the
united
states
and
the
uniform
federal
law
is
applicable.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
upon
the
adjournment
yesterday,
i
had
been
addressing
myself
as
to
our
view
as
to
what
law
applies
to
this
particular
case.
any
dissent
below
and
adopted
by
the
government
in
its
brief,
the
point
is
strongly
made
that
the
substantive
law
of
the
50
states
would
apply
and
be
the
determining
factor
as
to
whether
or
not
a
cause
of
action
could
be
brought
under
the
tort
claims
act
in
this
type
of
situation.
the
government
by
adopting
that
position
claims
that
the
application
of
the
substantive
law
of
the
50
states
would
create
a
situation
whereby
the
uniformity
of
the
federal
prison
system
would
be
undermined.
now,
we
hold
that
these
fears
are
groundless
and
that
the
substantive
law
of
the
state
in
this
particular
situation
does
not
apply
but
rather
that
the
cause
of
action
herein
is
based
upon
the
law
of
the
place
which
in
this
particular
case
is
grounded
upon
uniform
federal
law
through
the
constitution
as
cited
in
logan
against
the
united
states,
and
particularly
based
upon
the
duties
which
are
imposed
upon
the
bureau
of
prisons,
the
full
statute
of
which
is
set
forth
in
our
brief.
and
so,
we
claim
that
the
action
of
congress
in
enacting
the
statute
imposing
the
duties
upon
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
made
this
subject
a
federal
matter.
very
much
a
federal
matter
as
congress
considered
the
question
when
it
enacted
what
is
known
as
the
federal
range
code
which
is
referred
to
on
page
12
in
our
brief.
in
hatahley
against
united
states,
where
interpretation
of
that
code
was
involved,
the
court
said,
“it
is
clear
that
both
the
written
notice
and
the
failure
to
comply
are
express
conditions
precedent
to
the
employment
of
local
procedures.”
the
code,
that
is
the
federal
code,
the
taylor
grazing
act,
“is
of
course
the
law
of
the
range
and
the
activities
of
federal
agents
are
controlled
by
its
provisions.
they
are
required
to
follow
the
procedures
there
established.”
these
provisions
of
the
federal
code
were
of
course
obliged
to
become
the
law
of
the
state
or
the
law
of
the
place
in
interpreting
what
law
governed
that
situation.
and
the
court
went
on
further
to
say
at
page
180,
“we
are
faced
with
the
question
of
whether
the
government
is
liable
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
for
wrongful
and
tortuous
acts
of
its
employees
committed
in
an
attempt
to
enforce
a
federal
statute
which
they
administer.
we
believe
there
is
such
liability
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.”
and
a
similar
recognition
of
reliance
upon
federal
law,
where
congress
enacted
under
a
certain
set
of
facts
was
followed
in
hess
against
the
united
states
cited
on
page
13
of
our
brief.
it
is
our
contention
that
with
or
without
a
statute
or
with
or
without
the
common
law
of
the
state
of
connecticut
permitting
this
type
of
an
action
to
be
brought,
the
very
fact
that
congress
has
imposed
upon
the
bureau
of
prisons
certain
duties
establishes
this
cause
of
action.
and
we
say
that
the
state
of
connecticut
and
the
district
court
in
interpreting
what
law
is
to
be
applied
here
must
apply
the
federal
law.
that
is
the
law
of
the
place.
we
contend
also
and
the
subject
has
already
been
alluded
to
by
mr.
abt
that
the
tort
claims
act
gives
rise
to
a
cause
of
action
under
any
situation
accepting
for
those
specific
exclusions
which
are
set
forth
in
the
act
itself.
and
in
hatahley,
and
in
the
brown
against
the
u.s.,
and
in
brooks,
of
course
this
was
the
rule
that
was
very
clearly
stated.
we
distinguish
feres,
not
only
on
the
grounds
which
have
already
been
set
forth
to
the
court
but
further
on
the
grounds
that
national
policy,
the
very
fact
that
troops
maybe
in
one
day
by
themselves
or
as
a
unit
in
california,
the
next
day
in
washington,
the
next
day
in
new
york,
and
then
perhaps
overseas
requires
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
no
action
can
be
brought
for
negligence
when
they
are
being
transported
or
otherwise
in
active
service
because
there
is
a
certain
function
which
soldiers
are
required
to
perform
and
they
must
be
by
reason
of
their
mobility
free
or
the
government
must
be
free
from
any
claim.
now,
so
far
as
the
position
of
the
government
is
concerned
in
respect
to
this
question
again
of
the
variance
of
the
laws
of
the
50
states,
we
would
point
out
that
the
standard
of
care
which
is
to
be
applied
in
the
negligence
case
is
as
a
very
general
proposition
quite
uniform
throughout
the
country.
there
is
no
great
variance
in
the
50
states
as
to
a
standard
of
care,
the
application
may
vary
sometimes
to
some
degree
but
the
standard
is
rather
uniform.
in
the
government's
brief,
the
difficulty
that
the
courts
would
have
in
finding
a
standard
to
apply
in
the
type
of
claim
brought
by
muniz
is
commented
upon.
well,
if
there
is
no
standard
for
the
courts
as
the
government
claims,
surely,
we
can
by
reading
the
statute
imposing
the
duty
upon
the
bureau
of
prisons,
no
specific
standard
there
either.
the
duties
are
imposed
but
there
is
no
standard.
what
that
means
is
that
the
courts
are
to
set
the
standard
of
care
under
this
type
of
situation
under
hornbook
law.
the
courts
have
always
set
the
standard
of
care
in
negligence
cases
under
hornbook
law.
and
we
do
not
find
that
there
would
be
any
great
difficulty
on
the
part
of
the
court
in
interpreting
what
is
applying
the
standard
of
care
in
this
type
of
situation.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
no,
he
had
been
discharged,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
now
--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
well,
i
would
think
that
confronting
the
problem
for
the
first
time
at
this
moment,
that
if
an
action
was
brought,
that
relief
could
be
granted
and
i
don't
think
that
the
court
should
have
the
discretionary
power
to
in
anyway
affect
the
right
of
the
claimant
to
sue.
if
the
court
had
the
discretionary
power,
the
exercise
of
such
discretion
might
ultimately
result
in
the
elimination
of
the
course
of
action
--
of
the
cause
of
action
completely.
in
the
case
of
one
who
is
sentenced
to
death,
i
dare
say
that
the
fact
of
the
--
rather,
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment,
such
sentence
would
not
necessarily
--
would
not
necessarily
extinguish
the
right.
in
new
york
state
as
a
matter
of
policy,
there
can
be
no
such
action
brought
but
that
has
been
a
decision
which
the
new
york
authorities
have
felt
is
proper.
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
follows
but
that
would
have
to
be
uniform
in
every
situation.
the
government's
contention
that
discipline
would
be
undermined
very
much
by
the
questions
which
you
pose,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
think
perhaps
somewhat
overstated.
we
must
remember
that
in
these
situations,
unlike
the
situation
of
the
soldier
in
the
feres
case,
who
was
mobile
and
moving
around
the
country
and
in
the
sense
a
certain
free
agent,
every
inmate
of
these
institutions
is
under
custodial
supervision
24
hours
a
day.
the
--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
i
would
say
to
the
extent
that
he
moves
about.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
no,
that's
true
but
when
i
say
free
agent,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
mean
that
he
can
be
involved
in
situations
where
frequency
of
negligence
claims
could
become
a
factor.
he's
exposed
to
this
sort
of
thing.
on
the
other
hand,
muniz
and
all
of
the
other
prisoners
in
federal
institutions
are
controlled
24
hours
a
day.
they're
in
that
cells
or
they're
under
the
eyes
of
the
guards.
their
lives
are
completely
directed
from
dawn
to
dusk
and
beyond.
and
so
the
likelihood
of
them
becoming
involved
in
these
types
of
situations
perhaps
is
not
so
great
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
well,
i
don't
think
that
all
of
the
inmates
of
these
institutions
have
access
to
all
of
the
information
which
would
be
revealed
by
such
discovery.
furthermore
--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
well
--
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
to
some
extent
it
may.
but
of
course
we
must
remember
that
an
action
which
would
be
instituted
would
take
place
after
the
fact.
and
the
facts
that
would
come
out
in
the
discovery
proceedings
would
be
the
existence
of
the
security
arrangements
at
the
time
the
incident
occurred.
how
many
guards
were
involved
and
what
guard
did
what?
it
would
be
many
months
after
the
occurrence
of
an
act
that
these
discovery
proceedings
would
take
place.
and
any
information
that
might
be
revealed
would
deal
with
the
situation
at
the
time
that
the
alleged
tort
occurred.
and
so,
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
any
great
loss
of
information
or
any
great
hazard
created
by
the
revealing
of
such
information.
now,
the
government
also
claims
in
respect
to
problems
of
discipline
that
there
may
be
this
desire
on
the
part
of
the
inmate
to
come
to
court
in
the
lessening
of
security
and
so
forth.
it
causes
a
practical
matter,
most
of
these
actions
brought
under
the
tort
claims
act
would
be
brought
under
circumstances
where
there's
an
attorney
involved
with
the
vast
majority.
and
it's
unlikely
i
think
to
say
that
an
attorney
would
bring
an
action
of
these
circumstances
to
assist
the
--
and
in
the
feres
purpose
a
prisoner
may
have
in
mind
is
not
to
say
that
a
prisoner
couldn't
take
the
trip
to
court.
but
these
are
the
risks
that
we
face
and
then
this
is
the
price
of
maintaining
a
government
which
is
fair
to
all
people.
the
competency
of
the
courts
was
alluded
to
by
the
government
in
its
brief
and
they
feel
that
the
courts
who
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
judge
what
is
the
proper
standard
of
care.
and
i
remarked
before
that
of
course
the
courts
in
negligence
cases
have
consistently
ruled
in
these
matters
as
to
what
a
standard
of
care
--
what
the
standard
of
care
should
be.
the
issues
decided
by
courts
previously
have
been
far
more
complex
than
the
ones
posed
in
the
muniz
case.
and
certainly,
experts
are
available
to
assist
the
court.
in
the
eyes
of
muniz,
the
wording
of
the
tort
claims
act
that
any
act
may
be
--
any
action
may
be
commenced
accepting
for
the
exceptions
noted
in
the
statute
means
that
muniz
of
course
has
a
right
to
sue.
if
the
government's
contention
is
that
the
impact
upon
the
prison
system
would
be
so
severe
that
this
should
not
be
allowed
by
this
court.
and
that
you
should
read
an
exception
into
the
act,
we
say,
“let
muniz
sue.”
if
the
legislative
authority
which
enacted
the
tort
claims
act
comes
to
the
conclusion
after
its
investigation
that
mr.
muniz
in
this
type
of
situation
should
not
be
allowed
to
sue
in
the
future,
then
the
legislature
itself
can
enact
and
further
exception
to
the
tort
claims
act
impure
of
such
situation.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
congress
certainly
did
contemplate
it
because
the
statute
has
a
specific
exception
which
i
think
applies
to
this
situation.
no
claim
may
be
brought
for
an
assault
by
an
employee
of
the
government.
and
so,
under
this
type
of
situation,
no
action
could
be
brought.
mr.
richard
d.
friedman
one
of
the
specific
exemptions,
yes
sir.
the
government's
claim
would
mean
that
there
should
be
no
judicial
review
of
the
duties
which
are
imposed
on
the
bureau
of
prisons
or
the
manner
on
which
the
bureau
of
prisons
performs
those
duties.
if
this
contention
is
to
be
carried
out,
then
this
would
be
one
of
the
few
areas
of
government
where
there
is
no
judicial
review
of
the
duties
which
are
imposed
by
statute
upon
certain
segment
of
government
operations,
all
government
acts
by
and
large
are
reviewable
whether
the
cause
of
action
is
for
money
damages,
mandamus,
injunction,
breach
of
contract,
some
form
of
action
gives
judicial
review.
and
we
do
not
feel
that
the
prison
system
is
so
sanctified
as
to
be
immune
from
the
scrutiny
of
the
courts.
if
a
remedy
is
denied
to
mr.
muniz
in
this
particular
situation,
mr.
muniz
is
reduced
to
the
status
of
a
chattel.
it
puts
him
back
hundreds
of
years
when
a
--
when
an
inmate
was
subject
to
the
whim
and
the
caprice
of
his
jailer.
he
would
have
less
protection
perhaps
than
an
animal
today
which
is
protected
by
the
humane
society
laws.
in
weighing
the
contentions
of
the
government
and
the
policy
considerations
of
the
government,
i
would
ask
you
to
weigh
the
remarks
of
the
court
in
st.
louis
railway
company
against
heidrick,
109
arkansas
231,
which
the
court
said,
“a
man
does
not
cease
to
be
a
human
being
because
he
is
convicted
and
imprisoned
in
the
state
penitentiary.
he
does
not
thereby
necessarily
lose
all
sense
of
pride
and
pleasure
in
the
perfection
of
his
physical
organism.
although
occupying
a
felon's
cell,
he
may
experience
a
great
mental
anguish
over
the
dismemberment
of
his
body
and
consequent
disfigurement
of
his
person,
as
if
he
were
a
free
man.
and
the
law
is
not
so
in
human
as
to
deny
him
compensation
and
damages
against
anyone
who
may
have
negligently
inflicted
an
injury
upon
him.”
if
i
may
respectfully
call
to
the
court's
attention,
we
have
miscited
one
case
on
page
10
of
our
brief,
the
sharpnack
case,
instead
of
365
u.s.,
its
355
u.s.,
and
also
in
the
--
our
appendix
or
listing
of
cases.
and
in
respect
to
the
actual
charge
on
which
mr.
muniz
was
sentenced,
though
he
was
an
addict
and
being
treated
as
an
addict,
the
actual
basis
of
the
violation
was
postal
--
adopt
the
postal
money
ordinance.
but
he
was
an
addict
and
i
think
the
court
recognize
that
fact,
thank
you.
