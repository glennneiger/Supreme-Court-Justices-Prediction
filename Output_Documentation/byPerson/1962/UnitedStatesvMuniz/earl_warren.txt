mr.
abt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mat
i
ask
this?
has
there
been
passage
of
that
kind
since
1942?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
hear
you,
you
dropped
your
voice.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
it
you
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
states,
petitioner,
versus
carlos
muniz
and
henry
winston.
mr.
friedman,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doolittle.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doolittle,
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
quite
get
your
distinction
between
the
muniz
case
and
the
case
of
other
people
who
are
confined
in
penitentiaries.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
why,
why
in
muniz
--
why
is
muniz
any
different
from
any
--
any
felon
in
principle?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
if
ever
there
was
a
case,
it
is
that
of
muniz.
now
why,
why
is
that
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
class
do
you
--
what
do
you
define
as
the
class
in
which
he
falls?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
are
you
--
are
you
speaking
now
of
the
type
of
lawsuit
that
he
brings
or
are
you
speaking
of
him
as
a
certain
of
class
of
criminal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
lawsuit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
kind
of
a
lawsuit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
justice
clark
in
opening
his
discussion
of
the
statute
in
the
legislative
history,
mr.
abt
agreed
with
the
government
that
in
point
of
fact
congress
did
not
actually
focus
on
prisoner
claims.
as
far
as
we
can
determine
congress
never,
so
much
as
thought
about
the
question
of
whether
prisoner
claims
should
be
covered.
the
statement
in
the
report
that
mr.
abt
has
referred
to,
we
believe
was
a
general
reference
to
the
law
of
four
states.
the
congress
--
the
committee
was
merely
indicating
that
some
states
have
in
fact
allowed
tort
suites
against
them.
it
was
giving
several
examples.
new
york
was
one
of
those
examples.
there's
no
basis
at
all
for
assuming
that
congress
probed
deeply
into
new
york
--
the
new
york
situation
and
certainly
there's
no
basis
for
assuming
that
they
were
aware
of
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
under
the
new
york
situation.
we
think
--
we
think
that's
just
completely
unrealistic
statutory
construction.
the
fact
is,
as
i
say,
mr.
abt
agreed
that
its
clear
congress
didn't
really
focus
on
the
question
of
prisoner
claims.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
to
the
same
extent
that
they
focused
on
statutes
of
other
states,
they
did
not
allow
prisoner
suits.
so
that
--
there
--
there's
really
no
basis
for
assuming
that
they
adopted
new
york
practice,
particularly.
and
as
i
say
there's
definitely
no
basis
for
assuming
that
they
were
aware
of
all
the
underlying
considerations
in
new
york
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
your
honor.
illinois
and
so
far
as
we
know,
north
carolina
are
among
the
states
that
do
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
of
states
themselves,
suits
against
the
states,
we
are
only
aware
of
three
states
for
sure,
that
is
new
york,
illinois,
and
north
carolina.
now
counsel
has
also
suggested,
i
believe
to
the
state
of
washington
and
alabama,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doolittle,
i
think
that
one
of
the
things
that
bothers
me
is
this.
this
institution
in
which
mr.
muniz
was
incarcerated
had
both
prisoners
and
non-prisoners
there
being
treated
as
addicts,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
thought
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
do
you
have
--
you
do
have
such
institution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now
what,
what
troubles
me
is
this,
you
have
this
institution
where
you
have
intermingled
those
who
--
those
who
are
there
as
prisoners
and
those
who
are
being
treated
in
the
same
manner
because
they're
addicts.
now,
why
would
it
be
adverse
to
the
government's
interest
to
prevent
--
to
permit
this
man
to
have
a
cause
of
action
when
if
he
was
there
treated
as
a
patient?
he
could
have
the
same
kind
of
action
without
objection
from
the
government.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
why
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
asked
a
few
moments
ago,
whether
you
were
talking
about
mr.
muniz's
class
of
criminal
or
whether
you
were
talking
of
about
the
kind
of
action
that
he
was
bringing
against
the
government.
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
i
assume
that
if
he
brought
an
action
of
this
kind
and
i'm
not
--
and
the
one
who
is
a
nonprisoner
but
who
was
a
patient
of
lexington,
brought
the
same
kind
of
an
action
that
the
government
would
say
in
one
case
that
it's
wrong
to
permit
such
an
action
and
in
the
other
instance
that
it's
alright.
now
what
would
the
difference
be
insofar
as
the
class
of
action
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
in
those
--
in
that
kind
of
hospitals
there
--
they
don't
maintain
discipline
as
to
the
--
as
to
those
patients
who
were
there
for
narcotics?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
know
but
it
is.
i
don't
know
that
it
is
in
that
kind
of
an
institution.
do
you
know
that
it
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doolittle.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
just
one
more
question?
as
i
understand
--
understood
mr.
abt,
he
said
that
several
bills,
tort
liability
bills
were
introduced
prior
to
the
one
which
was
enacted
and
in
several
of
those
they
specifically
exempted
the
government
from
liability
for
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
actions
of
this
kind
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
in
this
action
nothing
was
said.
there
was
no
exemption.
now,
must
we
not
take
any
consideration
the
fact
that
congress
did
consider
these
things?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
