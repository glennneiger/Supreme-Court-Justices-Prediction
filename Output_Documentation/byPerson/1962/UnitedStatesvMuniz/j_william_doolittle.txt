mr.
j.
william
doolittle
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
two
cases
present
a
single
question
but
an
important
one,
whether
damage
claims
by
federal
prisoners
for
personal
injuries
sustained
as
an
incident
to
their
confinement
and
allegedly
caused
by
the
negligence
of
federal
prison
officials
are
cognizable
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
the
facts
are
simple
and
the
cases
arose
on
grants
of
motions
to
dismiss.
respondent
winston
filed
a
complaint,
alleging
that
while
he
was
an
inmate
in
the
united
states
penitentiary
at
terre
haute,
indiana,
he
suffered
a
brain
tumor.
that
prison
medical
officers
failed
to
use
reasonable
skill
and
care
in
examining
him
negligently
arrived
at
a
mistaken
diagnosis
of
his
condition
and
negligently
failed
to
give
him
needed
medical
treatment,
and
that
as
a
result
he
became
permanently
blind.
mr.
winston
seeks
damages
in
the
amount
of
$1
million.
respondent
muniz
complaint
alleged
that
while
he
was
an
inmate
in
the
federal
correctional
institution
at
danbury,
connecticut,
he
was
chased
by
a
dozen
fellow
prisoners
into
a
dormitory
into
which
he
was
--
they
were
all
thereafter
locked
by
the
guard.
that
he
was
beaten
unconscious
by
these
fellow
inmates
sustaining
a
skull
fracture
which
led
to
his
partial
blindness,
and
that
united
states
was
negligent
in
failing
to
have
available
sufficient
guards
to
prevent
the
incident
and
in
allowing
mentally
and
physically
abnormal
prisoners
to
mingle
with
other
prisoners
without
adequate
safeguards
and
supervision,
and
respondent
muniz
claims
damages
of
$250,000.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
would
say
that
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
complaint
is
that
the
fellow
prisoners
somehow
had
it
in
for
muniz
or
as
mr.
muniz
alleges
they
were
--
some
of
them
were
mentally
and
physically
abnormal,
but
they
--
for
some
reason
or
other
they
wanted
to
get
him
and
that
they
chased
him.
i
might
mention
that
the
danbury
institution
is
not
a
maximum
security
institution,
it's
one
in
which
there
would
be
considerably
more
freedom
of
action
on
the
part
of
the
prisoners.
both
complaints
were
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
as
the
federal
court
had
consistently
held,
the
federal
tort
claims
act
does
not
apply
to
prisoner
claims.
the
second
circuit
reversed
both
judgments,
first
by
a
divided
panel
and
then
by
a
five
to
four
vote
of
the
entire
bench
and
this
court
brought
the
case
here
on
the
government's
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
the
question
is
of
course
one
of
statutory
interpretation.
we
must
come
as
close
as
we
can
to
divining
the
intent
of
congress.
the
face
of
the
tort
claims
act
discloses
no
clear
purpose
on
the
part
of
congress
either
to
include
or
to
exclude
prisoner
claims,
nor
does
the
legislative
history
provide
very
much
more
enlightenment.
both
of
the
opinions
of
the
courts
below,
i
should
say
all
four
opinions
of
the
courts
below,
and
the
government
and
the
respondent
have
pointed
to
various
circumstances
in
the
history
of
the
act
contending
that
there
was
one
purpose
or
another
on
the
part
of
congress.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
however
that
on
balancing
all
of
these
competing
assertions
one
is
left
with
the
rather
clear
impression
that
in
passing
the
federal
tort
claims
act
congress
simply
did
not
focus
one
way
or
the
other
on
whether
or
not
prisoner
claims
should
be
covered
by
the
act.
there
is
one
element
in
the
statutory
context
of
the
tort
claims
act
as
opposed
to
its
specific
history
that
we
do
think
argues
quite
persuasively
against
the
coverage
of
prisoner
claims
by
the
act.
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
congress
had
established
an
administrative
compensation
scheme
for
injured
prisoners,
which
it
did
not
repeal
when
it
passed
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
originally
this
program
covered
just
accidents
taking
place
in
the
course
of
prison
industries,
but
recently
in
1961
it
was
amended
so
that
it
now
embraces
all
work
related
injuries,
including
institutional
maintenance
work
at
the
prison.
now
we
believe
this
remedy
is
the
exclusive
one
for
prisoners,
and
our
belief
is
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
congress
provided
both
in
the
original
act
and
in
the
act
as
amended.
that
compensation
under
this
program
should
be
no
greater
than
that
allowed
by
the
federal
employees
compensation
act.
it
would
be
anomalous
we
think
under
the
circumstances
to
allow
prisoners
to
bring
suits
under
the
tort
claims
act,
which
is
a
remedy
that
is
unavailable
to
government
employees
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
because
of
the
exclusivity
of
the
program
there
established.
in
short
from
the
standpoint
of
a
workable
consistent
statutory
scheme
of
remedies
against
the
government,
we
think
the
administrative
compensation
program
for
prisoners
like
those
for
government
employees
and
soldiers
should
be
considered
exclusive
and
that
no
tort
claims
act
remedy
should
be
available.
i
might
also
point
out
of
course
that
the
remedy
of
private
bills
is
always
available
for
cases
of
extreme
inequity
and
in
point
of
fact
congress
has
quite
regularly
passed
private
bills
for
the
benefits
of
prisoners
injured
in
prison.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
in
our
brief
or
the
statute?
well,
the
statute
is
18
u.s.c.
4126,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
in
its
entirety
it
is
not,
i'm
afraid
your
honor
the
--
a
portion
of
it
is
quoted
at
page
14.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
in
1961
is
when
it
was
brought
to
its
present
form
of
covering
substantially
all
work
related
injury.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
neither
before
amendment,
nor
after
would
it
cover
these
claims,
no
question
about
that,
your
honor.
what
we
consider
to
be
the
most
compelling
reason
for
denying
prisoners
the
privilege
of
suing
under
the
tort
claims
act
is
the
serious
consequences
that
would
flow
from
the
allowance
of
such
suits.
this
court
in
feres
against
united
states
in
340
us,
held
that
soldiers
could
not
sue
the
government
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
for
injuries
incident
to
their
military
service.
the
court's
reason
for
so
ruling
was
that
the
allowance
of
such
suits
would
have
such
an
adverse
impact
on
the
unique
federal
relationship
between
soldiers
and
their
superiors
and
would
so
undermine
military
discipline,
that
congress
could
not
be
assumed
to
have
intended
them
to
be
covered
by
the
act.
that
same
approach
should
we
believe
govern
this
case.
for
to
allow
federal
prisoners
to
sue
the
government
would
lead
to
such
extreme
results
we
do
not
see
how
congress
could
knowingly
have
entertained
such
a
design.
now
i
should
like
to
make
one
matter
clear
at
the
outset.
in
resisting
suits
by
federal
prisoners,
we
are
not
reflecting
any
concern
that
such
suits
would
cause
an
undue
drain
on
the
federal
treasury.
we
believe
that
the
incidents
of
genuinely
tortuous
actionable
conduct
on
the
part
of
federal
prison
officials
is
so
small,
that
there
would
be
no
more
than
a
handful
of
successful
suits,
nor
does
our
resistance
reflect
a
feeling
that
we
have
anything
to
hide.
the
federal
prison
system
is
one
of
the
finest,
if
not
the
finest
penal
system
in
the
world,
and
it
proudly
serves
as
a
model
not
only
for
the
states,
but
for
other
countries
as
well.
there
is
no
aspect
of
prison
administration
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
would
wish
to
conceal
from
public
view,
except
of
course
to
the
extent
necessarily
dictated
by
considerations
of
prison
security.
and
i
might
add
that
the
bureau's
excellent
program
for
the
review
of
prisoner
grievances
quickly
disposes
of
any
notion
that
legitimate
complaints
on
the
part
of
prisoners
will
go
unheard.
what
we
are
concerned
about
in
resisting
these
suits
is
the
same
kind
of
concern
that
motivated
this
court's
decision
in
the
feres
case
that
merely
to
permit
prisoners
to
file
suit
to
obtain
discovery
and
to
secure
trial
on
the
merits
irrespective
of
the
outcome
of
the
trial
will
seriously
undermine
prison
discipline
and
have
a
profoundly
adverse
impact
on
prison
administration.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
there
is
no
question
mr.
justice
goldberg
but
that
the
impact
on
prison
administration
and
discipline
would
be
substantially
reduced
by
such
a
qualification.
the
problem
would
still
be
there
to
some
extent,
but
certainly
it
would
reduce
the
problem
considerably.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
right
of
the
prisoner
to
sue
a
jailer
or
a
marshall
or
a
sheriff
is
relatively
well
established.
there
are
a
number
of
cases,
a
number
of
state
cases,
which
hold
that
a
prisoner
who
is
negligibly
mistreated
in
jail
may
bring
a
suit
against
his
jailer.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
in
tort,
that
is
right.
now,
his
right
to
do
so
with
respect
to
a
federal
penal
official
is
not
established.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
no
case
has
so
held
and
quite
recently,
quite
the
contrary
was
held
in
golub
against
krimsky
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
in
which
it
was
decided
that
no
suit
could
be
brought
against
a
federal
penal
official.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
i
would
pose
this
qualification
to
that.
the
suits
that
have
been
recognized
thus
far
have
been
against
as
i
say
jailers,
marshals,
sheriffs,
individuals
who
have
the
prisoner
in
custody
only
for
a
relatively
short
period
of
time
and
also
i
might
note
that
they
are
usually
bonded
officials,
which
gives
some
indication
as
to
the
intention
that
they
would
be
subject
to
such
suits.
as
far
as
officials
analogous
to
those
that
would
be
involved
in
the
present,
in
the
federal
prison
system,
no
such
right
is
available.
for
example,
we
know
of
no
cases
even
state
cases
where
administrators
of
a
general
integrated
prison
system
have
been
held
liable.
they
always
involved
the
local
jailers,
the
sheriffs,
the
marshals
and
whatnot.
we
think
that
this
makes
a
very
real
difference
in
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
oh!
no,
no
your
honor,
the
–-
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
in
new
york
there
is
a
general
tort
claims
act,
that's
–
yes,
that's
right
yeah,
this
is
true
in
other
states
as
well.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
i'm
talking
about
the
common
law
right
of
recovery
against
jailers
as
such.
now,
you
are
quite
right
that
the
new
york
federal
tort
claims,
i
mean
the
new
york
tort
claim
statute
applies
certainly
across
the
board
subject
only
to
the
qualification
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
has
indicated
that
a
suit
can
be
brought
only
after
the
prisoner
has
been
released.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
against
federal
prison
officials?
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
none
that
we
are
aware
of,
your
honor,
none
that
we
are
aware
of.
now,
i
want
to
emphasize
this
at
the
outset,
and
that
is
that,
we
do
not
feel
that
our
fears
as
to
the
impact
of
these
suits
are
idle
speculation.
they
reflect
that
carefully
considered
and
consistent
judgment
of
the
director
and
other
senior
officials
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
based
upon
their
educated
appraisal,
the
size,
the
diversity,
the
complexity
of
the
federal
prison
system
and
their
intimate
knowledge
of
its
strengthens
and
weaknesses,
its
problems
and
its
potential.
it's
based
upon
their
familiarity
with
the
makeup
of
the
federal
prison
population
and
the
characteristics
of
its
members,
including
a
proved
wet
readiness
on
the
part
of
the
many
of
them
to
abuse
remedial
processes
to
the
detriment
of
the
discipline
and
administration.
it
is
based
on
their
long
experience
with
the
difficulty
of
maintaining
the
sensitive
balance
between
discipline,
order
and
security
on
the
one
hand
and
rehabilitation,
and
correction
on
the
other.
their
sincere
conviction
that
to
allow
tort
claims
act
suits
for
prison
incident
injuries
would
have
a
severe
and
damaging
effect
on
the
prison
system
is
we
think
a
reasonable
one
that
is
entitled
to
considerable
weight.
now
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
suggest
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
the
thrust
of
our
argument
is
mr.
chief
justice
that
because
of
these
problems
that
would
be
post
by
such
suits,
many
of
them
obvious,
congress
cannot
have
intended,
it
just
could
not
have
intended
to
impose
liability
under
the
circumstances.
and
we
rely
on
the
approach
spelled
out
in
the
feres
case,
where
precisely
the
same
thing
was
held
with
respect
to
military
claims.
we
think
it
is
equally
obvious
there
too.
congress
couldn't
have
intended
military
claims
to
be
covered
in
the
tort
claims
act.
we
believe
this
court
was
eminently
correct
in
so
holding.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
i
emphasize
two
points
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
as
i
said
before,
we
are
not
talking
about
the
burden
--
the
financial
burden
of
such
suits.
but
secondly
and
more
importantly,
the
indian
towing
case
and
the
rayonier
case,
which
followed
it,
disposed
of
the
notion
that
conduct
was
beyond
the
scope
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
merely
because
it
was
the
kind
of
conduct
that
only
governments
engage
in,
purely
governmental
conduct.
we
do
not
make
that
claim
here.
we're
not
saying
that
this
is
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
act,
merely
because
it's
purely
governmental.
we
are
talking
about
the
impact
of
prisoner
suits
on
the
federal
prison
system,
on
its
day-to-day
operations
and
administration,
on
the
discipline
of
prisoners.
and
so,
in
that
sense,
we
are
talking
in
an
entirely
different
realm
from
the
indian
towing
and
the
rayonier
cases.
now
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
suggest
some
of
the
problems
that
give
raise
to
our
fears.
the
maintenance
of
a
high
and
pervasive
degree
of
discipline
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
accomplishment
of
penological
objectives;
not
only
prison
order
and
security,
but
also
prisoner
rehabilitation
as
well.
and
yet
effective
prison
discipline
is
extremely
difficult
to
achieve,
far
more
so
than
military
discipline.
prisoners
are
typically
hostile
to
the
whole
penal
system
and
have
no
sympathy
whatever
for
even
its
most
beneficent
objectives.
while
this
hostility
expresses
itself
in
many
ways,
it
naturally
tends
to
focus
upon
the
prison
administrators
and
the
guards
right
on
up
to
the
warden.
and
it
is
in
the
face
of
this
enmity
and
the
tension
that
it
breathes,
that
the
prison
administrators
must
achieve
to
maintain
discipline
and
they
must
do
so
largely
on
the
basis
of
their
day-to-day
personal
relationships
with
the
inmates,
the
confidence
and
the
respect
that
they
are
able
to
inspire.
for
experience
has
shown
that
truly
effective
penal
discipline
cannot
be
grounded
on
the
mere
threat
of
punishment.
nothing
we
think
could
be
better
calculated
to
breakdown
these
delicate
personal
relationships
on
which
disciplined
thus
so
largely
depends,
than
permitting
prisoners
to
file
tort
suits
against
their
custodians
challenging
their
actions
and
their
policies,
whenever
the
prisoners
are
so
disposed.
inevitably
the
authority
of
a
prison
official
who
is
entangled
in
litigation
with
a
prisoner
is
undermined,
in
relation
not
only
to
the
litigating
prisoner
himself,
but
to
his
fellow
inmates
as
well.
and
whether
or
not
his
claim
has
a
shred
of
merit,
the
prisoners
would
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
the
challenged
officers
would
be
subjected
to
investigation
by
their
superiors.
they
would
see
the
prison
officials
forced
to
answer
the
charges,
submit
to
discovery
and
defend
their
actions
in
court.
and
perhaps
the
prisoner
himself
would
even
get
a
chance
to
question
his
custodians
on
the
witness
stand.
and
of
course
to
the
extent
that
the
individual
official
status
is
downgraded
in
the
prison
community,
the
litigating
prisoners
would
be
enhanced
to
the
further
expense
of
effective
discipline.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
in
point
of
fact
your
honor
we
don't
know
what
their
experience
has
been,
the
only
basis
we
have
is
the
reported
cases
and
they
frankly
don't
tell
us
very
much.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
there
are
not
many
reported
cases.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
there
again,
we
don't
know
much
more
about
their
experience
except
the
number
of
cases
and
of
course,
their
statute
is
sufficiently
recent,
but
we
don't
have
wide
experience
there
as
counsel
for
--
as
counsel
for
the
respondent
winston
points
out,
the
suits
there
have
always
been
with
respect
to
prisoners
who
died.
so
we
don't
really
know
what
they
would
hold
with
respect
to
bringing
suits
in
prisons.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
there
again
your
honor,
we
don't
know
more
than
what
we
can
read
in
the
reported
cases.
and
so
far
as
we
know
the
prison
system
of
new
york
is
still
there,
but
we
do
urge
that
the
problems
are
significantly
different
when
the
remedy
is
limited
as
it
is
in
new
york,
but
there
is
the
further
qualification
that
the
suits
can
only
be
brought
in
one
court,
namely
the
court
of
claims
which
does
have
some
effect
in
reducing
problems
of
a
lack
of
uniformity.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
apparently
a
life-timer
would
be
unable
to
sue
your
honor,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
your
honor,
it
does.
another
complication
that
we've
referred
to
in
our
briefs
is
that
if
any
disciplinary
measure
should
be
imposed
on
a
litigating
prisoner
no
matter,
how
justified
it
might
be,
it
would
be
likely
to
be
considered
by
the
other
members
of
the
prisoner
population
as
a
form
of
retaliation
on
the
part
of
the
officials
who's
conduct
has
been
questioned
in
the
tort
suit.
and
this
would
aggravate
not
only
the
hostility,
intention
in
the
prison
atmosphere
generally,
but
would
no
doubt
lead
to
still
further
suits.
in
addition
to
these
more
or
less
indirect
affects
on
discipline,
it
seems
clear
that
a
frequent
subject
of
prisoner
suits
would
be
disciplinary
acts
and
programs
themselves.
again
wholly
apart
from
the
question
of
whether
or
not
any
of
these
challenges
could
be
successfully
asserted,
its
very
possibility
would
impose
a
grave
inhibition
on
the
freedom
of
action,
which
custodial
personnel
need
in
dealing
with
disciplinary
problems
in
a
prison.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
don't
believe
so.
yes
until
he
does.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
it
is
our
contention
that
they
would
have
to
allow
pursuits
of
this
character,
in
other
words
that
there
would
have
to
be
an
analogous
kind
of
liability.
we
find
considerable
support
for
that
we
think
in
the
rayonier
case
for
example
where
the
court
expressed
a
concern
as
to
what
the
law
of
the
state
of
washington
was
in
this
regard.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
oh,
not
at
all
your
honor.
in
this
realm
these
principles
must
operate
outside
the
question
of
sovereign
immunity.
so
there
is
no
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes,
your
honor
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
oh,
no.
i
think
the
concept
of
the
tort
claims
act
is
broad
enough
and
liberal
enough
to
include
the
analogy
of
the
prisoner
suits
against
jailers
and
prison
officials.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
not
all
states,
i
think
only
--
a
little
over
half
of
the
states
have
actually
ruled
on
the
question
one
way
or
the
other.
and
the
majority
of
those
that
have
ruled
on
it,
over
20
states
do
allow
such
suits.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right.
connecticut
is
the
other
state
in
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
there
is
a
question
with
respect
to
the
muniz
case
in
connecticut.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
would
think
not.
the
indiana
statutes
--
the
indiana
cases
do
support
liability
both
on
the
general
tort
principle
of
negligence
of
doctors
of
course,
but
also
jailer
suits.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no
a
federal
prisoner
who
was
in
the
lexington
facility
would
not
under
our
contention
be
allowed
to
sue
in
the
berman
case,
holds
that
he
may
not
sue
under
the
tort
claims
act.
non-prisoners
in
such
facilities
might
be
able
to
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
the
whole
trust
of
our
argument
goes
to
that
very
point
and
that
is
that
when
you're
dealing
with
prisoners
you
do
have
the
problem.
that
they
are
there
involuntarily
and
there
are
these
problems
of
discipline
and
of
administrating
a
prison
system,
and
of
course
to
the
extent
that
a
prisoner
must
be
sent
to
the
drug
addiction
center,
he
is
still
a
prisoner
and
this
--
for
that
purpose
this
must
be
considered
an
extension
of
prison
system,
but
the
same
considerations
just
don't
apply
when
we're
dealing
with
such
areas
as
civilian
addicts
who
are
being
treated
in
the
center.
there
maybe
other
provisions
such
as
the
discretionary
functions
provision
that
would
apply
in
that
case,
but
as
far
as
the
general
applicability
of
the
act,
the
problems
that
we
pose,
the
reasons
why
we
think
congress
couldn't
have
intended
prisoners
to
be
covered
would
not
apply
with
very
much
force
to
civilians
who
are
in
the
addiction
center.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's,
right,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
on
that
point,
no.
now
the
allowance
of
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
we
believe
that
that
would
be
the
case
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
i
might
say
that
one
of
the
points
made
in
the
feres
case
is
not
central
to
the
court's
decision,
one
of
the
points
made
there
was
this
very
point
that
you
have
to
look
to
the
relationships
of
the
parties
and
the
status
of
both
parties
in
order
to
determine
what
the
circumstances
are
in
which
the
government
is
being
held
liable.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
the
--
of
course
one
of
the
problems
in
the
feres
case
was
that
there
has
been
substantially
no
cases
decided
on
the
point
and
perhaps
this
is
an
area
in
which
there
would
be
some
room
for
expansion,
but
i
think
the
conclusion
you
stated
is
essentially
correct,
that
as
the
laws
stood
and
as
the
cases
spelled
out
the
law
that
would
have
been
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
perhaps
they
could
have
your
honor,
but
it
didn't
and
i
suspect
that
one
of
the
reasons,
one
of
the
most
important
reasons
was
that
of
course
if
that
is
the
question,
if
the
question
must
be
determined
whether
or
not
there
is
an
analogous
of
state
liability,
the
case
generally
speaking
must
go
to
trial
or
at
least
there
must
be
some
preliminary
litigation
and
the
whole
point
of
the
feres
case
is
that
this
whole
operation
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
get
off
the
ground
in
the
first
place,
a
complete
exclusion
of
military
claims.
the
allowance
of
tort
claims
act
suits
would,
we
believe,
interfere
in
many
ways
with
the
sound
and
orderly
administration
of
the
prison
system.
it
is
predictable
that
such
suits
will
be
filed
in
very
large
numbers,
although
as
i
have
indicated
we're
confident,
that
but
a
very
few
could
be
successfully
asserted.
experience
of
tests
that
many
of
them
would
be
filed
in
outright
bad
faith,
some
to
satisfy
a
grudge
or
to
get
revenge,
some
to
obtain
some
excitement
or
to
secure
some
relief
from
the
tedium
of
prison
life,
some
in
the
hope
that
somewhere
along
the
line
the
prisoner's
chance
of
escape
would
be
enhanced,
as
indeed
it
would
be
and
were
necessary
to
take
him
to
trial.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
believe
that
a
few
have
been
filed,
but
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
don't
believe.
no
i
don't
have
any
figures.
i'm
told
that
four
suits
have
been
filed
to
our
knowledge.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
i
don't
think
the
problem
would
be
nearly
as
severe
if
they
merely
sued
each
other.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
i
would
suppose
that
the
courts,
as
it
would
be
true
in
this
situation,
which
has
a
considerable
amount
of
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
require
that
the
prisoner
be
brought
to
trial,
and
we
don't
suggest,
for
example,
that
in
every
case
that
even
went
to
trial
under
the
tort
claims
act
the
prisoner
would
necessarily
be
brought
to
trial.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
it
would
certainly
seem
that
he
would.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
might
also
suggest
that
while
the
problem
frankly
has
not
arisen,
there
has
not
been
a
state
of
prisoner
suits
against
one
prisoner
against
another.
i
do
think
that
this
would
be
an
area
that
would
be
within
the
proper
control
of
prison
authorities
that
they
could
impose
restrictions
on
the
extent
to
which
prisoners
could
do
that.
a
number
of
the
states,
for
example,
do
not
allow
prisoners
to
file
civil
suits.
now
how
does
that
apply
to
this
case?
it
would
seem
to
me
quite
inconsistent
with
a
congressional
purpose
to
allow
prisoners
to
sue
under
the
tort
claims
act
that
this
court
should
find
that
congress
had
such
a
purpose
for
the
prison
system
to
not
to
allow
them
to
bring
such
suits.
and
therefore,
we
don't
assume
that
any
such
administrative
remedy
would
be
readily
available
in
this
situation.
one
of
the
problems
with
which
we
are
most
concerned
and
one
of
the
administrative
problems
with
which
we
are
most
concerned
is
the
problem
of
discovery.
the
prosecution
of
most
suits
under
the
tort
claims
act,
most
prisoner
suits
under
the
tort
claims
act
would
probably
depend
to
a
considerable
extent
on
discovery,
involving,
as
they
do,
a
unique
kind
of
society
operating
wholly
behind
walls
and
barbed
wire
fences.
such
discovery,
apart
from
the
administrative
burden
of
compliance,
would
pose
a
great
threat
to
prison
security
and
order
because
security
considerations
are
involved
in
almost
every
aspect
of
prisoner
life,
and
this
would
be
a
problem
in
almost
every
case,
but
the
muniz
case
here
before
the
court
poses
the
question
in
a
particularly
striking
way.
the
compliant
there
challenges
the
prison's
staffing
procedures
for
dealing
with
breaches
of
order.
imagine
the
interest
with
which
depositions
and
testimony
in
that
case
will
be
received
by
the
prisoners
as
strategic
intelligence
to
support
a
plan
of
escape
or
violence.
i
might
add
that
the
task
of
keeping
such
intelligence
from
them
would
be
well
nigh
impossible.
and
of
course,
the
suits
that
went
to
trial
would
present
still
further
problems,
and
it
would
be
difficult
we
think
to
keep
these
suits
from
going
to
trial
no
matter
what
their
merit
was.
because
it
is
not
difficult
to
spell
out
a
colorable
compliant
in
tort,
especially
in
the
unique
context
of
prison
life,
for
most
judges
will
be
unfamiliar
with
what
is
generally
considered
necessary
improper
in
prison
administration.
they
will
be
unable
to
appraise
the
charges
in
the
defenses
without
a
considerable
evidentiary
presentation.
and
i
have
already
alluded
to
the
increased
chances
of
escape;
the
prisoner
should
go
to
trial,
the
interferences
with
prison
discipline
and
the
problem
that
the
exposure
of
prison
procedures
and
policies
would
pose
to
prison
order
and
security.
furthermore,
the
necessity
of
transporting
guards
and
other
officials
to
appear
as
witnesses
would
strain
the
already
overburdened
staffs
of
the
prisons.
we
have
covered
some
of
the
other
problems
posed
by
prisoner
suits
at
some
length
in
our
brief
and
i
shall
not
dwell
long
on
them
here
today.
one
difficulty
is
that
the
tort
claims
act
makes
liability
turn
on
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
the
allegedly
negligent
conduct
took
place.
and
because
of
that,
its
application
to
prisoner
suits
would
subject
federal
prison
system
to
the
varying
laws
on
standards
of
care
and
actual
liability
of
the
24
states
in
which
federal
prison
institutions
are
located.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
don't
see
how
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
the
reason
i
don't
think
it
would
is
that
the
limitation
in
new
york
is
not
actually
a
part
of
the
tort
claims
act,
it
is
a
--
that
the
provision
that
the
prisoner
is
civilly
dead
while
he
is
in
prison,
which
is
an
entirely
separate
provision.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
would
not
suppose
that
that
could
be
applied
in
the
federal
court
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
couldn't
tell
you,
your
honor.
we
think
too
that
the
application
of
the
act
to
prisoner
suits
would
necessarily
involve
federal
judges
in
the
day-to-day
management
of
internal
prison
operations.
prison
administrators
would
have
to
run
the
prisons
in
light
of
what
the
judges
thought
or
might
be
expected
to
think
with
sound
penal
and
correctional
policy,
whether
or
not
it
supported
with
the
administrator's
ideas
on
the
subject.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
--
it
quiet
possibly
would
be
a
good
idea
for
them
to
learn
more
but
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
expecting
too
much
of
them
to
get
into
the
details
of
prison
management
that
you
would
have
to
for
any
of
these
suits.
these
suits
are
perfect
examples
of
the
extent
to
which
genuine
supervision
over
prisons
that
would
be
involved
in
this
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
we
think
it
will
be
regrettable
if
the
ground
on
which
they
learn
should
be
these
tort
claims
acts
suits
against
the
government
for
prisoner
claims,
because
by
the
time
they
really
became
experts
the
prison
system
might
be
in
very
sad
shape
indeed.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
short
of
our
argument
is
that
just
as
in
the
feres
case
in
relation
to
military
claims,
congress
cannot
have
indented
to
subject
federal
prison
system
to
the
extreme
results
that
would
attend
prisoner
suits
under
the
tort
claims
act.
the
corollary
to
that
conclusion
is
that
it
is
congress
that
should
decide
and
consciously
decide
what
form
of
relief
is
appropriate
for
prisoners.
is
the
prisoner
compensation
scheme
as
recently
expanded
a
sufficient
remedy?
should
it
be
further
expanded
to
cover
a
wider
range
of
injuries?
if
a
judicial
remedy
is
appropriate,
should
it
be
limited
to
suites
filed
after
release
as
in
new
york
or
should
the
bringing
of
such
suits
be
limited
to
a
single
specialized
court
as
in
both
new
york
and
illinois.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
in
the
cases
that
have
thus
for
been
decided
in
federal
court?
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
oh,
nothing
but
the
dismissal
of
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
nothing.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
if
i
might
--
may
say
there
are
several
reasons
your
honor
why
we
don't
think
that
the
experience
even
if
were
available
to
us
would
be
particularly
applicable.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
if
we
had
and
i
don't
know
whether
how
readily
available
such
information
would
be,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
this.
our
fears
are
based
on
the
considered
and
i
might
say
acknowledgeable
judgment
of
the
senior
officials
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
taking
into
account
the
system
that
they
run,
a
system
which
is
very
different
from
the
state
systems,
even
the
larger
state
systems
and
i
might
add
also
that
in
the
case
of
each
of
the
systems
that
you
have
named
there
are
limitations
on
the
remedy
that
considerably
reduce
the
level
of
the
problems
that
would
be
presented.
they
don't
eliminate
them
entirely,
but
they
go
a
long
way
and
of
course
this
is
something
that
would
not
be
available
under
the
tort
claims
act,
certainly
would
not
be
available
without
further
legislation
by
congress.
in
short,
we
think
that
the
federal
prison
officials
knowing
as
they
know
their
system,
knowing
as
they
know
the
prisoner
population
with
which
they
are
dealing
has
a
considerable
basis
for
making
these
judgments
as
to
what
the
problems
would
be
that
they
face.
and
we
do
seriously
question
that
the
experience
of
these
states
would
be
very
helpful
in
varying
on
our
problems.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps,
the
most
conspicuous
gap
in
the
respondent's
case
is
that
in
broadly
arguing
that
no
ill
effects
will
attend
the
allowance
of
prisoner
suits.
they
always
avoid
talking
about
the
really
troublesome
class
of
cases
of
which
the
muniz
case
is
a
classic
example,
those
directly
challenging
actions,
policies,
and
procedures
for
the
maintenance
of
prison
order
and
security.
one
finds
the
same
gap
in
the
decision
below
as
the
dissenters
pointed
out.
the
majority
analyzed
the
whole
question
of
prisoner
suits
in
the
context
of
the
winston
case,
whose
facts
of
course
do
not
present
the
problems
with
which
we
are
concerned
in
nearly
their
most
serious
form.
and
then
it's
simply
reversed
in
the
muniz
case,
the
truly
hard
case
on
the
basis
of
the
winston
opinion.
whatever
may
be
thought
of
prisoner
cases
generally,
if
there
ever
was
a
class
of
cases
in
which
congress
could
not
possibly
have
assumed
--
could
not
possibly
be
assumed
to
condone
judicial
review.
it
is
in
cases
like
muniz
where
the
challenge
is
to
a
guard's
action
in
quelling
an
incipient
riot
to
a
warden's
determination
as
to
the
size
and
the
placement
of
his
guard
staff.
for
such
challenges
go
to
the
very
essence
of
the
complex
subtle
means
by
which
penological
objectives
are
attained,
thus
in
its
allegations
of
insufficient
guards,
the
muniz
complaint
challenges
the
whole
rehabilitative
philosophy
of
a
minimum
security
facility
such
as
the
one
at
danbury,
connecticut.
the
ratio
of
guards
to
prisoners
that
such
a
facility
is
determined
of
course
on
the
basis
of
what
must
be
recognized
by
all
as
a
calculated
risk,
a
fine
and
sensitive
balancing
between
the
likelihood
under
one
hand
that
some
prisoners
may
escape,
that
there
may
be
some
violence,
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
proved
advantages
for
rehabilitation
to
be
gained
from
placing
trust
in
the
prisoners
and
allowing
them
a
reasonable
degree
of
freedom.
to
subject
such
determinations
to
judicial
review
would
be
only
to
invite
a
serious
retrogression
in
rehabilitative
and
correctional
procedures.
for
problems
in
this
sensitive
area
can
always
be
avoided
by
more
rigorous
order,
stricter
discipline
and
tighter
security.
the
incident
in
the
muniz
case
could
doubtless
had
been
avoided
by
a
substantially
higher
guard-prisoner
ratio
or
on
harsh
restrictions,
by
imposing
harsh
restrictions
on
prisoner
freedom.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
but
what
would
have
been
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
we
are
simply
saying
that
in
the
case
that
involves
--
a
factual
situation
that's
involves
the
--
a
challenge
to
the
prisoner's
authority's
maintenance
of
order,
discipline,
security,
that
the
considerations
are
so
wavy
that
congress
could
not
possibly
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
the
question
is
not
really
why
muniz
is
any
different
from
any
felon,
any
more
than
the
question
is
whether
the
soldier
is
any
different
from
any
other
human
being.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
prob
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
say,
the
class
of
cases
in
which
muniz
falls.
now,
muniz
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
class
of
cases
in
which
his
case
falls
are
challenges
to
the
actions,
the
procedures,
the
policies
by
which
prison
officials
maintain
prison
order,
prison
discipline,
prison
security.
this
of
course
is
not
the
case
in
winston
but
it
is
the
case
in
muniz.
and
we
say
particularly
on
the
analogy
of
the
feres
case,
the
military
case
that
here
is
the
class
of
cases
that
congress
could
not
conceivably
have
wished
to
be
subject
to
judicial
review.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
oh,
of
course
i'm
not
speaking
of
him
as
a
class
of
criminal.
i'm
talking
about
the
kind
of
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
--
challenge
that
he
makes.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right,
essentially.
yes,
your
honor.
that's
(inaudible)
--
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
florida,
i
believe
it's
not
against
the
state.
isn't
it
against
municipalities
and
then
of
course
there
--
i
believe
there
is
some
20
odd
states
that
have
decided
that
were
--
of
that
sheriffs
and
marshalls
and
whatnot
maybe
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
individually.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no,
sir.
no.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
he
was
at
danbury
which
is
a
correctional
institution.
he
was
not
--
no
time
was
mr.
muniz
in
a
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
there
is
the
situation
at
lexington
that
where
a
prisoner
needs
a
special
kind
of
treatment.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
and
of
course
the
government
gives
him
that
special
kind
of
treatment
even
if
he
has
to
go
to
a
nonpenal
facility.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
the
fact
is,
your
honor,
that
the
individuals
--
the
prisoner's
relation
to
his
government,
even
though
he
maybe
in
the
same
institution
although
undoubtedly
segregated
with
regular
civilians,
his
status,
his
relationship
to
the
government
is
very
different.
he
is
--
he
is
subject
to
the
governmental
discipline.
he
has
to
be
watched
of
course.
he
can't
be
allowed
to
escape.
the
relationship
has
just
totally
different
the
same
way
that
the
--
a
soldier
could
no
doubt
be
involved
in
altercation
with
civilians.
the
fact
would
remain
under
the
feres
case
that
if
he
were
on
active
duty,
now
he
could
not
bring
any
suit
on
the
basis
of
such
an
altercation
whereas
the
civilians
could.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
it's
a
--
all
the
questions,
his
relationships
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i'm
talk
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that'd
be
--
the
difference
would
be,
your
honor,
in
the
status
of
the
prisoner
and
the
--
his
relationship
to
the
government,
that
--
that's
my
point.
now,
in
--
the
focus
that
i've
been
giving
this
morning
on
the
muniz
case,
i
am
talking
about
a
--
cases
in
particular
that
raise
the
problem
of
the
maintenance
of
discipline,
order
and
security.
now,
it
would
depend
on
the
kind
of
altercation
that
might
take
place
at
lexington,
whether
or
not
those
considerations
would
apply
there.
but
if
in
fact
the
prisoner
and
say
another
civilian
should
be
involved
in
the
same
general
incident
at
an
institution
like
lexington,
kentucky,
these
considerations
would
not
apply
to
the
civilian.
the
united
states
is
not
trying
to
keep
the
civilian
in
a
state
of
discipline,
the
--
it's
not
trying
to
maintain
security
as
to
him.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
oh,
of
course,
your
honor,
in
the
same
respect
that
a
private
institution
to
which
somebody
goes
voluntarily,
of
course
has
to
maintain
certain
levels
of
order.
now,
this
would
be
true
in
the
government
but
i'm
sure
you'll
agree
with
me
that
the
--
the
level
of
discipline,
the
level
of
order,
the
level
of
security
must
be
totally
different
in
relation
to
a
prisoner.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i'm
sure
that
it
is,
your
honor.
just
as
at
st.
elizabeth's
hospital,
there's
a
maximum
security
area
for
people
who
were
there,
for
criminal
reasons.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
and
of
course
one
of
the
points
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
the
point
i'm
making
with
respect
to
danbury,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
whole
point
that
i
am
making,
mr.
justice
clark,
is
that
the
federal
government
is
doing
its
best,
as
all
enlightened
penal
systems
are
doing
their
best
to
adopt
the
most
forward
looking
rehabilitative
philosophy.
and
one
of
our
gravest
concerns
is
that
the
subjection
of
this
philosophy
to
judicial
review
as
this
very
case
would
subject
it
to
review
could
set
the
whole
philosophy
back
many,
many
years.
because
as
i
say
in
order
to
avoid
suits
like
this,
in
order
to
(inaudible)
--
to
avoid
incidents
such
as
that
on
the
muniz
case,
all
they'd
have
to
do
would
be
tighten
up
discipline,
tighten
up
security,
and
nobody
could
object
to
that.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
point
though
that
we
have
been
making
that
i
tried
to
make
yesterday
and
today
is
that
it
is
the
actual
subjecting
of
the
process
to
review.
to
us
it's
not
at
all
unlike
the
possibility
of
subjecting
the
com
--
military
combat
situation
to
review
the
decisions
that
must
be
made
in
connection
with
maintaining
prison
order,
discipline,
and
security.
and
must
also
--
often
be
made
on
a
split
second
basis,
often
involve
the
most
complex,
the
most
difficult
problems.
and
we,
as
i
say,
we
genuinely
believe
that
that
in
cases
like
muniz
there
is
a
real
analogy
to
the
problem
of
military
combat,
and
i
suppose
no
one
would
suppose
that
the
tort
law
ought
to
be
applied
to
military
combat
no
matter
how
enlightened
the
judge
is.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right.
it's
the
same
general
problem
as
the
military,
which
this
court
had
no
trouble
saying
congress
of
course
would
never
concede
that
the
military
establishment
should
be
subjected
to
judicial
review
in
the
form
of
tort
actions.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
types
of
complaint.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
i
would
--
i
would
make
two
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
all
of
those
bills,
i
might
say
were
10
years
at
the
very
least.
ten
years
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
tort
claims
act.
so
that
any
presumption
that
the
members
of
congress
who
passed
the
tort
claims
act
that
we're
aware
of
them
is
somewhat
strained
but
more
to
the
point
in
the
feres
case,
precisely
the
same
situation
was
present.
there
had
been
a
number
even
more
tort
claims
bills
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
tort
claims
act,
excluding
military
claims.
and
this
court
said
in
feres
that
this
again
was
an
unrealistic
way
of
interpreting
the
tort
claims
act.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
thank
you.
