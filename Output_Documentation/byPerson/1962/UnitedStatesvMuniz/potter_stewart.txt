justice
potter
stewart
mr.
doolittle,
judge
hanks
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
of
appeals
said
something,
which
is
true
i
hadn't
realized
and
that
is
that
the
right
of
action
of
a
prisoner
against
the
warden
or
the
jailer
is
well
established
as
a
common
law,
is
that
correct?
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
in
tort.
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
extent
there
is,
there
might
be
such
a
common
law
right
this
case
is
different
than
from
the
--
let's
call
[inaudible]
the
army
case.
there
has
been
a
right
of
a
soldier
to
bring
a
tort
action
against
his
commanding
officer,
has
there?
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
–-
justice
potter
stewart
you
go
on
mr.
doolittle,
i'm
not
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
any
event
that
this
court
should
hold
against
you
in
these
cases,
then
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
suit
could
actually
be
filed
would
depend
upon
the
state
law
and
not
upon
just
generally
the
substantive
state
law
of
assault
and
battery
in
the
connecticut
case
or
malpractice
in
the
indiana
case,
but
rather
upon
and
initially
upon
the
narrow
question
of
whether
under
the
state
law,
there
is
a
right
of
action
by
a
prisoner
against
the
jailer.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
that
--
if
that
is
right,
what
was
the
--
why
did
there
have
to
be
a
feres
case,
because
if
that's
right,
i
suppose
there
couldn't
have
been
right
of
action
by
a
soldier
against
his
government
anywhere?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
suppose
though
--
let's
say
the
court
had
decided
the
feres
case
the
opposite
way
and
said
sure
as
far
as
the
federal
tort
claims
act
goes,
there
is
the
federal
courts
have
jurisdictions.
if
you
are
right
as
to
your
construction
of
the
statute,
there
still
could
never
been
a
suit,
because
no
state
allows
a
soldier
to
sue
his
employer
or
his
commanding
officer.
justice
potter
stewart
most
of
these
difficulties
and
troubles
with
the
engendered
--
if
prisoners
just
sued
each
other,
there
is
nothing
to
stop
them
from
doing
that.
justice
potter
stewart
all
right,
it's
only
if
whether
they
have
to
get
out
of
the
prison
and
to
have
a
trial
and
they
get
all
this
--
the
distractions
from
prisoner
team
writing
their
briefs
and
complaints.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
this
case
arising
in
connecticut,
i
suppose
it
is
clear
that
the
petitioner,
the
appellant
has
a
--
the
petitioner
has
a
claim
of
[inaudible]
against
the
12
fellow
prisoners
would
be
[inaudible]
doesn't
it,
ordinary
claim.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
court
couldn't
–
it
presumably
shouldn't,
it
closed
its
doors
to
him
just
because
he
is
in
prison,
because
he
is
going
to
be
there
for
a
long
term.
justice
potter
stewart
they
would
be
a
bad
thing
for
federal
judges
to
learn
more
about
prisons,
they
do?
justice
potter
stewart
it
just
occurred
to
me
that
federal
judges
are
engaged
almost
daily
in
dealing
out
sometimes
very
generously
other
people's
time
to
be
spent
in
prison
and
many
of
them
are
--
that
are
sitting
inside
of
the
prison
cells
themselves
and
don't
know
to
what
their
sentencing
needs
to
[inaudible]
might
not
be
a
bad
thing
at
all
for
knowing
more.
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
did
these
bills
--
it
has
to
do
with
the
compensations
for
what
would
have
been
a
tort
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
–
you
say
this
prisoner
will
be
cured.
