mr.
john
j.
abt
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court?
i
shall
address
my
argument
to
the
winston
complaint,
which
alleges
that
winston
suffered
blindness
and
other
injuries,
because
of
the
negligent
and
willful
failure
both
of
the
prison
officials
and
medical
officers
at
the
terre
haute
penitentiary
to
provide
him
with
timely
and
competent
medical
care
for
what
proved
to
be
a
brain
tumor.
as
the
complaint
alleges
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
over
a
period
of
many
months,
winston
experienced
and
complained
of
extreme
instability
of
--
in
his
walking
and
suffered
periodic
losses
of
vision,
the
personnel
at
terre
haute
did
nothing
for
him
expect
to
administer
dramamine
pills.
mr.
john
j.
abt
in
the
dennis
case
and
also
in
the
contempt
case.
mr.
john
j.
abt
wasn't
until
i
saw
him
in
prison
some
months
later
and
saw
the
condition
that
he
was
in,
and
insisted
that
he'd
be
given
a
medical
examination
that
this
was
done
--
was
found
that
he
had
a
benign
tumor
at
the
cerebellum
and
the
operation
came,
but
came
too
late
to
save
his
sight.
now
the
government's
argument
is
based
in
the
first
instance
on
the
premise
that
what
they
referred
to
in
their
briefs
as
the
legislative
context
of
the
act
discloses
no
indication
that
the
congress
intended
to
include
to
the
claims
of
prisoners.
i
think
that
this
claim
has
patently
--
that
this
premise
is
patently
false
one.
if
we
use
the
normal
tools
of
statutory
construction,
what
the
act
says
on
its
phase
and
what
its
legislative
history
shows
that
it
becomes
pretty
clear
that
congress
did
intend
so
far
as
you
can
come
to
any
assured
conclusion
about
an
attempt
on
any
of
these
issues
that
congress
did
intend
to
include
the
claims
of
prisoners.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that
it
focused
on
the
prisoners.
no
i
don't
think
we
can
say
that
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
john
j.
abt
there
is
no
testimony
about
prisoners,
anything
that
you
can
say
both
from
the
text
of
the
act
and
from
the
legislative
history
got
to
do
by
a
way
of
inference,
but
that's
normal
procedure
in
trying
to
construe
a
statute.
and
what
i'd
like
to
do
first
is
to
talk
about
the
text
of
the
statute
and
then
say
something
about
the
legislative
history.
first
as
to
its
text,
the
act
waives
the
government's
immunity
in
very
broad
and
general
terms
and
makes
the
government
liable
in
tort
for
the
acts
of
its
employees
while
acting
within
scope
of
their
employment
to
the
same
extent
or
under
circumstances
where
a
private
person
would
be
liable
under
the
law,
the
place
where
the
tort
was
committed.
now
i
would
like
to
emphasize
first
of
all
that
the
conduct
charged
in
the
winston
complaint
is
not
only
conduct
that's
clearly
within
the
scope
of
the
authority
of
the
prison
officials
and
medical
officers
at
terre
haute,
but
it's
also
a
violation
of
the
expressed
statutory
duty
imposed
on
the
bureau
of
prisons
by
section
40,
42
of
the
criminal
code,
which
makes
it
the
duty
of
the
bureau
to
provide
for
the
care,
protection,
and
safety
being
of
federal
prisoners,
the
statute
is
in
my
brief.
the
act
specifies
13
classes
of
claims
which
are
excluded
from
coverage
they
now
appear
in
section
2680
of
the
judicial
code.
since
prisoner
claims
are
not
included
among
these,
the
inference
is
that
congress
intended
to
include
them.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
it
can
and
i'll
come
to
the
feres
case
in
a
few
moments
if
i
may.
the
government,
mr.
doolittle
this
morning
--
this
afternoon
conceded
that
the
fact
that
the
operation
of
a
prison
is
a
uniquely
governmental
function
that
does
not
exempt
the
united
states
from
liability
under
the
act
and
that
concession
is
necessary
under
the
indian
towing
and
rayonier
cases
which
held
that
the
act
embraces
the
claims
resulting
from
the
performance
of
governmental
functions
that
have
no
parallel
whatsoever
in
private
activity.
as
i
read
those
cases
the
test
that
they
establish
is
whether
a
private
person
would
be
liable
for
similar
negligence
under
the
general
tort
law
principles
of
the
place
or
state
where
the
tort
was
committed.
the
winston
complaint
satisfies
this
test
because
malpractice
by
doctors
and
negligence
by
private
hospitals
is
actionable
in
indiana.
now,
i
disagree
with
mr.
doolittle's
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
don't
think
that
it's
necessary
in
order
to
establish
a
case
within
the
framework
of
the
act
and
the
coverage
of
the
act
to
show
that
there
is
an
identical
private
liability.
that's
exactly
what
indian
towing
and
rayonier
said
it
was
not
necessary.
all
they
said
was
--
in
the
rayonier
case
for
example,
mr.
justice
black
was
dealing
with
–
his
opinion
was
dealing
with
the
case
of
firefighting
and
he
pointed
out
that
under
washington
law
like
as
in
most
states,
firefighting
is
considered
to
be
a
governmental
function
and
there
is
no
action
not
--
no
action
for
negligence
either
against
the
firefighters
or
against
the
state
or
municipality,
but
nevertheless
the
government
was
held
liable.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
just
perfectly
correct,
but
i
think
and
i'm
trying
to
come
to
that,
let
me
just
foreshadow
it.
i
think
pretty
clearly
that
feres
was
overruled
with
respect
to
that
ground
of
the
decision
by
indian
towing
and
rayonier.
and
not
–
let
me
say
this
you
got
the
line
of
cases
feres
and
then
dalehite
which
relies
on
feres
and
then
came
indian
towing
and
rayonier
which
overruled
dalehite
and
also
must
have
overruled
feres
in
the
process.
i
should
say
of
course
that
indian
--
that
the
present
case
seems
to
me
presents
a
stronger
case
for
liability
than
either
indian
towing
or
rayonier
in
two
respects.
first,
here
there
is
the
kind
of
parallel
private
liability
that
mr.
doolittle
says
it
necessary,
if
it
should
be
necessary
i
don't
think
it
is
and
second,
here
also
is
the
express
statutory
duty
of
care
imposed
on
the
bureau
of
prisons
and
there
was
no
of
course
no
express
statutory
duty
in
respect
to
the
light
housekeeper
in
the
indian
towing
or
the
firefighters
in
rayonier.
for
these
reasons
it
seems
to
me
that
winston's
claim
was
well
within
the
act
if
you
take
--
if
you
look
at
it
that
on
space
and
that
this
conclusion
is
more
than
confirmed
by
the
legislative
history.
and
first
i
want
to
speak
about
the
house
and
senate
reports
which
i
quoted
at
page
12
of
my
brief.
those
reports
show,
first
of
all
that
congress
deliberately
meant
to
apply
the
principle
of
expressio
unius,
that
is
to
say
that
the
only
classes
of
claims
that
it
intended
to
accept
from
coverage
was
those
which
it
specifically
enumerated
in
what
is
now
section
2680.
the
report
shows
another
important
thing,
the
reports,
both
senate
and
the
house
report
and
that
is
that
those
claims
which
congress
specified
in
2680
and
withdrew
from
the
coverage
of
the
act
were
those
first
of
all
which
it
felt
as
a
matter
of
policy
should
be
free
from
the
threat
of
damage
suits
and
second
goes
as
to
which
is
thought
that
there
was
an
alternative
adequate
remedy
for
compensation.
and
it
seems
to
me
therefore
that
although
the
house
reports
speaks
in
general
terms
and
--
house
and
senate
reports,
that
the
committees
anticipated
and
rejected
both
of
the
arguments
which
mr.
doolittle
made
here
this
afternoon;
first,
the
argument
that
the
administrative
compensation
remedy
is
exclusive
and
second
the
argument
that
running
a
prison
is
such
a
difficult
job
that
it
should
be
free
of
a
threat
of
damage.
now
the
only
way
you
can
reconcile
the
statements
in
those
reports
with
mr.
doolittle's
position
as
to
say,
well
this
is
a
case
of
congressional
oversight
and
i
think
there
are
at
least
three
reasons
why
you
can't
say
that.
by
congressional
oversight
i
mean
that
as
you
indicated
earlier
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
congress
just
wasn't
thinking
about
prisoners
at
all.
i'd
say
i
think
there
are
three
items
of
legislative
history
that
make
that
kind
of
a
conclusion
impossible.
first
of
all
there
were
21
private
bills
for
the
relief
of
prisoners
that
the
congress
passed
in
the
decade
to
prior
to
the
tort
claims
act,
and
there
must
have
been
many,
many
more
that
were
dealt
within
committee
and
defiled
of
passage,
because
the
ratio
of
private
bills
introduced
to
private
bills
passed
in
those
days
was
about
7
to
1.
mr.
john
j.
abt
46.
mr.
john
j.
abt
some
of
them
did,
some
of
them
were
like
workmen's
comp
--were
claims
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
no
[inaudible].
these
are
claims
of
the
types
that
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
john
j.
abt
21
of
them,
21
bills
such
bills
passed
mr.
justice
black
and
what
i
said
was
that
the
21
passed
there
must
have
been
many,
many
more
that
were
introduced
and
didn't
pass.
mr.
john
j.
abt
injuries
to
prisoners,
yes
sir,
tort
claims
of
prisoners.
so
the
congress
must
have
been
perfectly
aware
from
the
volume
of
this
business
that
there
were
such
animals
as
prisoner's
claims.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
really
would
be
guessing
and
i
don't
want
to
guess,
i
don't
know.
second
and
perhaps
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
they
passed
three
bills
since
three,
three
i
believe,
which
the
government
has
the
number
in
their
brief,
i
think
three
or
four
perhaps,
since
then,
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
from
that
respect
that
each
of
those
in
a
company
that
is
the
bill
has
been
referred
to
the
department
of
justice,
has
been
accompanied
by
a
letter
from
the
attorney
general
in
which
the
attorney
general
says
that
no
relief,
there
is
no
other
remedy
available.
so
that
congress
really
has
acted
on
the
representation
that's
being
made
to
the
court
here
today,
plus
the
fact
of
course
that
there
have
been
a
number
of
lower
court
decisions
denying
the
coverage
of
prisoners,
but
congress
has
never
made
any
independent
determination
as
to
what
its
own
intent
was
when
it
passed
the
act.
now
there
is
a
second
reason
why
i
think
that
it's
impossible
to
say
this
is
a
matter
of
oversight
and
that
is
that
six
trot
claims
bills
that
were
antecedent
to
the
bill
that
was
finally
enacted,
the
46th
act,
contained
specific
exemptions,
which
either
excluded
prisoner
claims
entirely
from
the
act
or
adopted
the
new
york
approach
and
excluded
suits
during
the
incarceration
of
the
prisoner.
finally
the
report
of
a
house
committee
shows
that
congress
was
familiar
with
the
operation
of
the
new
york
tort
claims
act,
which
was
passed
in
1929
and
which
is
patterned
exactly
after
the
federal
act.
it
waives
the
states
immunity
from
--
or
to
put
the
other
way
the
federal
act
has
patterned
after
the
new
york
act,
the
[inaudible]
act.
the
new
york
act
waives
the
state
sovereign
immunity
and
makes
the
state's
liability
the
equivalent
of
the
liability
of
private
person.
and
the
house
report
says
and
i
quote
after
describing
the
new
york
legislation,
“such
legislation
does
not
appear
to
have
had
any
detrimental
or
undesirable
effect.”
now
at
the
time
that
those
words
were
written
it
was
well
established
by
decisions
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
that
prisoners
had
a
right
of
action
under
the
new
york
court
of
claims
act.
nevertheless
congress
didn't
exclude
prisoner's
claims
from
the
federal
act.
mr.
john
j.
abt
page
14.
mr.
john
j.
abt
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
right.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
no;
that
couched
in
the
same
terms
of
the
federal
act.
mr.
john
j.
abt
so
called
a
civil
debt
statute.
that's
a
provision
of
the
penal
code
that
prohibits
prisoners
from
filing
suits
while
they
are
in
prison.
mr.
john
j.
abt
although
congress
apparently
at
one
time
contemplated
doing
precisely
that
in
one
statute
in
one
of
these
tort
claim
bills
that
was
a
predecessor
to
the
one
was
passed.
mr.
john
j.
abt
measure,
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
john
j.
abt
oh,
the
tort
claims
act
specifically
provides
that
punitive
damages
are
not
permissible.
new
york
--
i
think
new
york
does
not
have
the
same
exception
that
the
tort
claims
act
has
so
that
i
suppose
theoretically
punitive
damages
might
be
possible.
i
don't
know
of
any
case
which
ordered
–
pardon?
mr.
john
j.
abt
possibly
get
both,
yes.
oh
i
don't
know
of
any
new
york
case
that's
ordered
punitive
damages.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
think
the
history
of
illinois
is
a
little
bit
--
is
rather
interesting
and
particularly
in
connection
with
both
something
that
judge
kaufman
said
in
his
dissent
and
something
that
the
government
says
in
its
brief.
both
of
them
say
that
what
i
said
about
this
--
about
the
reference
to
the
new
york
statute
really
has
no
significance
because
congress
also
referred
to
a
california,
arizona,
and
illinois
statute
under
which
prisoners
were
not
allowed
to
be
covered.
it
so
happens
however
that
those
three
statutes
were
held
to
be
statutes
which
did
not
waive
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
states.
but
the
effect
of
those
statutes
were
simply
to
give
a
new
remedy
through
a
suit
for
preexisting
forms
of
state
liability
and
it
was
because
of
the
limitation
of
those
statutes,
that
the
courts
in
those
states
held
that
prisoners
couldn't
sue.
now
this
was
true
of
the
illinois
statute,
which
was
passed
in
1917,
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
continued
till
1945.
in
1945
the
same
year
the
federal
act
was
passed,
illinois
passed
a
tort
claim
statute
substantially
the
equivalent
of
the
federal
statute.
under
the
old
statute,
the
illinois
cases
had
held
like
california
and
arizona
the
prisoners
couldn't
sue
because
there
was
no
waiver
of
the
sovereign
immunity.
under
the
new
statute,
which
was
similarly
a
general
statute
and
which
doesn't
talk
about
prisoners,
illinois
has
consistently
held
the
prisoners
can
sue
because
the
statute
did
waive,
the
only
impediment
to
suit
and
that
was
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
state.
now
i'd
like
--
simply
like
to
point
out
that
the
presumption
that
arises
as
i
see
it
from
the
fact
that
the
federal
act
followed
the
pattern
of
the
new
york
act
and
that
at
the
time
the
federal
act
was
passed
it
was
well
established
in
new
york
that
prisoners
could
sue
if
there
was
a
presumption
or
if
you
don't
want
to
raise
it
to
the
level
of
a
presumption,
at
least
a
strong
inference
that
congress
intended
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
it
said
it
had
taken
a
look
at
the
new
york
statute
it
had
no
harmful
effects,
there's
a
presumption
or
an
inference.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no
of
course
not,
of
course
not,
but
the
--
it
indicates
to
me
that
congress
mush
have
had
a
look
at
the
operation
of
the
new
york
statutes,
otherwise
it
couldn't
have
said
that
it
had
no
harmful
effect
and
if
it
taken
a
look,
it
must
have
encountered
the
cases
construing
the
statute.
now
i
recognize
of
course
that
this
mode
of
statutory
construction
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
pardon?
mr.
john
j.
abt
harmful
or
undesirable.
mr.
john
j.
abt
detrimental
or
undesirable,
yes
sir.
now
i
recognize
that
this
is
not
a
conclusive
measure
of
statutory
construction,
but
it
harmonizes
first
with
the
text
of
the
act
and
second
with
the
rest
of
the
legislative
history
and
when
you
put
it
all
together,
i
simply
don't
see
how
you
can
say
as
the
government
does,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
context
that
shows
that
congress
intended
one
thing
or
another
about
the
claims
of
prisoners.
now
i'd
like
to
come
to
the
decision
in
feres
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
it
weren't
for
that
case
nobody
could
stand
before
this
court
and
seriously
argue
that
the
claims
of
prisoners
aren't
covered
under
the
tort
claims
act.
feres,
if
you
read
the
opinion
and
i
think
you
have
to
distinguish
between
the
grounds
that
the
court
assigned
for
its
opinion
and
grounds
that
have
subsequently
been
assigned
to
support
the
opinion,
if
you
look
at
the
opinion
itself,
it
assigned
two
grounds.
first
of
all
it
said
that
congress
has
already
provided
a
uniform
compensation
system
for
servicemen,
which
the
court
described
as
comprehensive,
uniform
and
certain
and
not
negligible
or
negative.
and
it
said
that
congress
having
done
that,
it
couldn't
have
intended
this
uniform
federal
system
to
exclude
a
remedy
under
the
act
based
as
the
ex-remedy
is
on
the
vagaries
of
the
state
laws.
now
first
of
all
the
result
in
the
feres
case
is
inapplicable
to
the
facts
here
because
as
mr.
doolittle
conceded
that
he
must,
neither
winston's
claim
or
muniz's
claim
is
compensable
under
this
administrative
scheme
for
prisoners.
second,
and
i
don't
want
to
go
into
it
here,
but
i
show
in
my
brief
starting
at
page
21
that
the
limited
federal
scheme
authorizing
administrative
compensation
for
work
related
injuries
lacks
all
of
the
characteristics
that
is
comprehensiveness,
uniformity
and
certainty
and
adequacy
that
were
stressed
in
the
feres
case
as
the
grounds
for
making
the
remedy
exclusive.
besides
this
and
in
any
event,
this
ground
for
the
decision
in
feres,
that's
to
say
the
presence
of
a
compensation
system
for
servicemen
is
contrary
both
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
brooks
versus
united
states,
which
preceded
feres
and
in
the
decision
in
united
states
versus
brown
which
followed
feres;
both
cases,
both
of
those
cases
said
that
a
service
man,
who
incurred
injuries
while
not
on
active
duty
could
sue
under
the
tort
claims
act
and
they
dismissed
the
argument
that
the
compensation
scheme,
for
veterans
was
an
exclusive
remedy.
now
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
in
my
brief,
oh
yes
i
do.
mr.
john
j.
abt
on
page
21
of
the
brief,
i
discuss
--
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you,
you
mean
the
competition
act
for
servicemen?
mr.
john
j.
abt
for
prisoners,
yeah,
page
21
of
my
brief.
mr.
john
j.
abt
now
the
second
ground
for
the
feres
decision
was
the
one
that
you
called
--
you
mentioned
earlier
mr.
justice
goldberg,
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
precedent
in
american
law
for
permitting
a
solider
or
militiamen
on
active
duty
to
recover
for
negligence
either
from
the
superior
officers
or
from
his
government.
and
mr.
justice
jackson
in
the
opinion
in
that
case
said
that
the
purpose,
and
i
quote
him,
“that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
not
to
visit
the
government
with
novel
and
unprecedented
liabilities.”
and
therefore
that
it
shouldn't
be
construed
to
authorize,
what
he
called
a
radical
departure
from
established
law.
now
first
of
all
that
ground
for
the
decision
in
feres
is
inapplicable
here,
i
don't
want
to
do
repeat
what
was
said
during
mr.
doolittle's
argument,
but
we
have
the
new
york
court
of
claims
statute,
the
illinois
court
of
claim
statute,
the
north
carolina
court
of
claim
statute,
there
are
three
states
in
which
the
prisoner
has
been
allowed
to
recover
without
benefits
of
a
statute
and
furthermore
there
are
there
many
cases,
which
allow
recovery
against
jailers.
now
it's
perfectly
true
as
mr.
doolittle
says
that
most,
if
not
all
of
those
cases
had
referenced
the
local
jails,
but
if
you
read
the
decisions
nothing
was
made
to
hinge
on
the
fact
that
they
were
local
jails
rather
than
penitentiaries.
also
the
chief
justice
i
think
inquired
as
to
how
many
prisoner
cases
there
had
been
in
illinois,
unfortunately
the
illinois
court
of
claims
is
very
late
in
reporting
its
cases,
so
there
are
considerably
more.
the
clerk
of
the
court
tells
me
on
appearance
of
cases,
i
think
there
are
six
or
seven
perhaps
reported
cases,
but
the
very
positive
of
the
number
of
cases
that
have
been
instituted
there
and
in
north
carolina
as
well
seems
to
me,
it
tends
completely
to
destroy
mr.
doolittle's
argument
that
prisoners
are
going
to
take
advantage
of
tort
claims
statutes
if
they
are
permitted
to
sue
under
them,
to
raise
all
of
kinds
trouble,
discovery
proceedings
and
whatnot.
there
is
a
minimum
or
let's
put
it
this
way,
an
easily
manageable
number
of
cases
that
have
been
instituted
in
these
three
states,
which
allow
them
under
their
tort
claim
act.
but
coming
back
to
the
feres,
the
presence
of
this
volume
of
judicial
decision
permitting
prisoners
to
recover,
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
case
of
the
serviceman
whereas
mr.
justice
jackson
said
there
wasn't
a
single
case
anywhere
permitting
such
recovery.
mr.
john
j.
abt
correct.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
my
second
ground
as
to
why
that
--
the
second
ground
for
feres
is
inapplicable.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well
i
didn't
go
into
it
myself,
because
i
assume
that
the
court
had
assumed
that
they
were
covered
and
it
seems
to
me
as
i
recall
the
decision
now
mr.
justice
jackson
at
very
end
gives
examples
or
indicates
the
recovery
that
was
--
or
the
payments
that
were
made
under
the
compensation
act,
in
at
least
--
it
seems
to
me
at
least
two
of
the
cases,
if
not
all
of
them.
now
it
may
well
be
that
as
this
court
indicated
both
in
brooks
versus
the
united
states
and
united
states
versus
brown,
that
the
basic
but
unstated
ground
for
the
decision
in
feres
was
a
belief
that
allowing
servicemen
on
activity
duty
to
recover
for
tort
injuries
to
themselves,
would
be
so
extreme
and
so
outlandish
that
congress
just
couldn't
have
contemplated
it.
however,
none
of
the
considerations
that
are
applicable
to
a
solider
on
active
duty
has
any
bearing
on
the
case
of
a
prisoner.
the
difference
in
the
two
situations
it
seems
to
me
are
highlighted
by
the
statute
that
imposes
a
duty
of
care,
protection
and
safe
keeping
on
bureau
of
prisons
in
its
relation
to
prisoners.
it's
inconceivable
to
me
that
congress
should
impose
a
similar
duty
on
the
department
of
the
army
in
relation
to
soldiers.
and
if
there
was
nothing
outlandish
or
absurd
in
the
imposition
of
that
duty
by
congress
on
the
bureau
of
prisons,
then
how
can
anyone
say
that
it's
outlandish
for
congress
to
permit
a
remedy
for
a
breach
of
a
duty
which
itself
has
prescribed.
i
don't
--
i've
dealt
with
in
my
brief
at
some
length
with
the
government's
discussion
of
all
of
these
dire
consequences,
which
it
seems
to
me
in
the
first
place
are
refuted
--
that
is
the
arguments
are
refuted
by
the
point
that
the
chief
justice
made
while
mr.
doolittle
was
arguing,
and
that
is
to
say
that
all
of
this
is
suppositions
and
we
do
have
many
years
of
experience
in
the
three
states
with
tort
claims
act
which
allow
prisoners
to
recover
and
there
are
many
states
which
have
permitted
recovery
against
jailers.
and
out
of
that
vast
experience,
long
experience
at
least
the
government
can
give
us
no
examples
of
anything
undesirable
or
harmful
that's
occurred.
and
it
seems
to
me
though
about
all
we
have
here
is
a
splendid
example
of
observation
that
mr.
justice
jackson
made
in
his
dissent
in
the
dalehite
case,
in
which
he
said
the
government
as
a
defendant
can
exert
an
unctuous
persuasiveness
because
it
can
close
official
carelessness
with
the
public
interest.
and
it
seems
to
that
that's
what
mr.
doolittle's
argument
and
the
government's
argument
in
this
case
comes
down
to.
of
course
the
bureau
of
prisoners
--
prison
has
an
administrator's
normal
aversion
to
any
form
of
supervision.
every
administrator
thinks
he
is
doing
a
wonderful
job,
in
a
complex
situation
that
only
he
himself
can
handle.
and
he
fears
that
the
job
will
be
ruined
if
the
heavy
and
untutored
hand
of
court
or
a
regulatory
body
is
allowed
to
intrude.
now
the
only
novelty
in
this
case
is
that
here
it's
the
department
of
justice,
which
has
abandoned
its
normal
role
of
poo-pooing
these
fears
when
they're
advanced
on
behalf
of
some
private
interests
and
urges
instead
that
they
be
dignified
and
given
status
as
a
controlling
principle
of
statutory
construction.
finally
i'd
like
to
suggest
that
the
proposal
of
this
court
carve
out
an
exception
for
prisoner
claims
is
really
inequitable.
what
is
made
at
the
time
and
the
whole
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
from
tort
liability
has
fallen
into
such
disrepute
that
even
without
waiting
for
an
action
by
the
legislature
the
highest
courts
of
five
states
california,
michigan,
wisconsin,
illinois,
and
florida
have
advocated
the
doctrine
by
judicial
decision,
and
significantly
in
the
florida
case
the
supreme
court
of
florida
sitting
en
banc
took
occasion
to
advocate
the
doctrine
in
a
case
involving
a
prisoner,
and
none
of
the
other
four
states,
which
have
advocated
the
doctrine
by
judicial
decision
have
made
any
reservations
either
for
the
claims
of
a
prisoner
or
of
anybody
else.
mr.
friedman
will
continue
for
the
respondent
muniz.
