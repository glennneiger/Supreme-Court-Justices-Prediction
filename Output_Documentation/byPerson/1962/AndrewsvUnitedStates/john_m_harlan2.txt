john
m.
harlan
what
year
was
this,
mr.
prettyman?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
know
why
it
should
take
this
long?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
seven
years
after.
justice
john
m.
harlan
fantastic
to
me.
how
does
that
happen?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
any
--
was
a
sentence
ever
imposed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
never
reimposed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
the
sen
--
the
old
sentence
have
been
vacated.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
these
men
are
standing
at
the
bar
now
unsentenced.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
convicted.
justice
john
m.
harlan
either
of
the
lawyers
get
up
to
say,
they
made
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
make
speech.
justice
john
m.
harlan
maybe
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
because
they
weren't
represented
by
mr.
barnett.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
an
error
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
your
view
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
got
a
threshold
question
here.
you've
the
case
at
some
point
[inaudible]
independent
of
whether
it
is
35
or
2255
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
order
entered
on
the
motion
includes
these
other
things
that
follow
the
word
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
isn't
an
ambiguity.
justice
john
m.
harlan
prior
to
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
i
may
say
so,
you
have
made
a
wonderful
ingenious
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
view
as
i
understand
it,
the
government
treating
this
as
2255,
i
follow
your
argument
up
to
that
point,
but
your
view
is
that
the
government
can
only
appeal,
it
has
to
appeal
at
the
--
i
won't
use
the
word
interlocutory
stage,
but
the
stage
at
which
the
order
vacating
and
it
has
no
right
to
appeal
on
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
if
the
judge
let
it
in
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
before
you
could
get
your
papers
out
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
judge
sentenced
him,
resentenced
him.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
you'd
waited
until
the
sentence
was
reimposed,
this
man
was
resentenced,
and
then
it
turned
out
that
the
judge
reimposed
the
same
sentence,
could
you
appeal?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
would
think
so.
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
would
think
so
and
therefore
that's
still
a
possibility.
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
isn't
that
make
the
order
without
anything
more
and
why
doesn't
that
render
the
order
final?
