--
albert
andrews,
petitioner,
versus
united
states,
and
robert
l.
donovan
versus
united
states
in
number
494.
mr.
prettyman
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
do
so.
mr.
barnett?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
resolve
these
things
--
like
this
against
the
defendant
when
the
law
says
that
the
judge
shall
afford
him
an
opportunity
to
say
something?
now,
it's
so
simple
for
a
judge
to
say
that
mr.
jones
and
mr.
andrews
or
whatever
his
name
is
have
you
anything
to
say
before
i
sentence
you.
why
do
you
try
to
support
that
to
the
extent
of
saying,
“well,
he
might
have
been
able
to
stand
up
there
and
even
though
his
attorney
had
said,
“i'll
do
the
talking
for
you”,
or
something
else,
why
do
you
try
to
put
that
burden
on
the
defendant
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
when
it's
so
simple
for
a
judge
to
say
is
do
you
have
anything
to
say
before
i
sentence
you
to
the
penitentiary.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
you
want
us
to
say
that
if
the
judge
doesn't
do
it,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
fellow
will
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
will
be
without
the
benefit
of
that
portion
of
the
procedure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
seven
years.
was
that
whole
seven
years
attributable
to
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understood
from
counsel,
there
were
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
it
has
to
do
with
the
seven
years
that
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
are
you
so
sure
that
it
would
have
happened
at
that
time,
what
if
it
didn't
happen
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
law
says
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
law
says
he
shall
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
our
case
say
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
our
case
say
that
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
don't
our
cases
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
he's
entitled
personally
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
asking
us
to
overrule
those?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
really
was
something
at
stake
here
because
the
judge
as
to
one
of
these
defendants
suspended
the
sentence.
he
sent
the
other
one
to
jail
for
25
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
there's
anything
in
the
procedure
that
would
give
--
that
would
give
a
defendant
the
right
to
say
something
in
his
behalf,
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
how
you
could
say
that
it
was
inconsequential
that
the
judge
didn't
--
that
the
judge
didn't
afford
him
the
opportunity
clearly
to
do
it
because
the
statute
says
that
the
judge
shall
give
him
the
right
to
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
can
we
say
here
that
it
had
no
impact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
here,
now
you're
arguing
on
the
theory
that
this
is
2255.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
are
you
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
different
if
it's
under
rule
31?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
--
i
think
we
know
the
difference
between
the
two,
but
how
did
the
judge
treat
this?
did
he
treat
it
as
rule
31
or
2255?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
of
course
it
does.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
you
can't
appeal
--
if
you
can
appeal
on
the
31
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
judge
treated
it
as
31
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you're
not
probably
here,
are
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
don't
want
to
say
now
whether
the
judge
treated
it
as
a
31
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
31
or
2255
because
really
in
following
you,
that
becomes
very,
very
important.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
which
is
it?
how
do
you
treat
it,
31
or
2255?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
and
then
he
treated
that
as
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
had
no
right
of
appeal
in
donovan's
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
claiming
the
right
to
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
release.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
critical
word
is
--
isn't
in
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
he
ask
for
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
be
committed
the
same
as
donovan
was
under
35.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
donovan
was
treated
under
35
and
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
he
asked
to
be
treated
the
same
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
did
the
court
then
--
the
court
ought
to
say
he's
treated
as
the
35
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
from
mr.
prettyman
that
all
through
the
proceeding,
it
was
listed
in
the
criminal
case
itself
and
not
as
a
collateral
proceeding
and
not
as
a
civil
proceeding.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
didn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
didn't
get
that
impression
from
mr.
prettyman
but
we
will
clear
it
up
with
him
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
when
he
comes
off.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
that
the
way
2255
is
done
in
the
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
court
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
court
have
that
same
power
under
habeas
corpus?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you
believe
that
2255
transcends
habeas
corpus
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
so
and
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
serves
a
purpose
over
and
beyond
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
doing
it
pretty
well
for
me.[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
barnett,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
suppose
this
defendant
was
serving
a
10-year
term
for
another
crime
before
he
started
to
serve
his
sentence
for
this
crime.
and
during
that
10-year
term,
he
asked
for
2255
relief.
would
he
be
entitled
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
next
question
i
want
to
ask
you
then
is
this.
if
congress
intended
that
this
2255
proceeding
be
for
the
purpose
of
correcting
a
sentence
as
well
as
for
the
release,
why
would
we
come
to
that
conclusion
and
why
wouldn't
he
be
entitled
to
relief
under
2255
whether
he
was
serving
another
sentence
or
not
if
his
--
if
his
sentence
was
wrong?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
the
position
of
the
government
from
now
on
that
2255
and
rule
35,
it
can
be
used
interchangeably
by
the
defendant
for
the
purpose
of
correcting
his
sentence
for
errors
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
can
you
answer
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
answer
that
question
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
instead
of
turning?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
mr.
barnett
could
the
petitioner
in
this
case
have
properly
proceeded
either
under
2255
or
rule
35
in
order
to
obtain
the
relief
which
you
sought
here,
namely,
merely
to
have
his
sentence
corrected.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
he'd
have
to
--
he'd
have
to
vacate
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now,
could
he
--
could
he
have
properly
apply
either
under
rule
35
or
2255?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
--
you
say
he
had
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
he
had
a
right
to
seek
this
relief
under
2255
because
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
say
then
that
he
had
no
right
to
proceed
under
rule
35
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
obtain
this
relief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
talking
about
the
procedure.
suppose
he
had
asked
the
court
specifically
for
a
relief
under
sect
--
under
rule
35,
would
he
have
been
properly
before
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
judge
have
said
specifically
that
i
consider
this
to
be
an
application
under
rule
35.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
consider
that
you're
properly
here,
asking
this
relief
under
rule
35
and
i
set
your
sentence
aside
under
rule
35
and
reconsider.
could
you
have
appealed
from
that
order?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
what
theory?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
prettyman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
prettyman,
before
you
sit
down,
i
would
like
to
express
the
appreciation
of
the
court
to
you
for
having
assumed
as
public
service
that
you
have
assumed
in
representing
this
indigent
defendant.
it
always
gives
us
a
feeling
of
security
to
know
that
lawyers
are
willing
to
devote
their
time
and
their
effort
to
cases
of
this
kind
that
the
--
on
the
assignment
of
the
court
and
we
appreciated
very
much
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
mr.
barnett,
of
course,
we
appreciate
the
very
earnest,
diligent
manner
in
which
you
represented
the
interest
of
the
government.
