mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
and
i
will
treat
it
as
a
single
case
for
most
purposes,
raises
the
question
whether
the
government,
prior
to
the
resentencing
of
two
defendants
in
a
criminal
case,
may
appeal
the
orders
directing
that
the
resentencing
take
place.
this
case
originated
in
1954
when
three
men
were
arrested
in
connection
with
an
attempted
mail
robbery.
these
men
were
albert
andrews,
robert
donovan,
and
hyman
cohen.
mr.
cohen
is
no
long
in
--
no
longer
involved
in
this
proceeding.
they
were
convicted
on
all
three
counts
in
a
trial
before
judge
lawrence
walsh
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
they
were
convicted,
that
is,
of
assaulting
a
post
office
employee
with
an
attempt
to
rob
with
putting
the
life
of
the
same
post
office
employee
in
jeopardy
by
the
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon
and
of
conspiracy.
now
immediately
upon
conviction
and
apparently
without
any
presentence
required
of
law
and
without
asking
the
defendants
whether
they
had
anything
to
say
either
in
mitigation
of
sentence
or
on
their
own
behalf,
judge
walsh
sentenced
all
three
of
them.
counts
1
and
2
merged
so
there
was
no
sentence
on
those
--
on
the
first
count.
on
the
second
count,
he
gave
them
the
mandatory
25
years,
and
on
the
third
count,
he
gave
them
five
years
to
run
concurrently
with
the
25-year
sentence.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
this
was
1954,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
the
appeal
on
the
case
was
not
heard
until
1957.
the
record
doesn't
show
why
there
was
that
delay.
i
have
inquired
of
both
mr.
healey
and
mr.
friedman
to
determine
and
their
answer
is
that
due
to
some
difficulties
about
payments
in
the
in
forma
pauperis
petitions
and
various
other
things,
it
simply
drifted
on
that
long.
now,
the
second
circuit
affirmed
the
convictions,
but
remanded
for
resentencing
because
judge
walsh
had
erroneously
thought
that
he
could
not
grant
probation
on
the
mandatory
count.
now
notice
that
the
remand
for
resentencing
was
specifically
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
probation
could
be
granted.
it
was
in
the
light
of
his
right
to
grant
probation
that
that
remand
took
place.
the
resentencing
was
first
scheduled
for
may
15,
1957,
deferred
for
five
days
so
that
one
of
the
counsels
could
prepare
legal
memo.
on
may
28th,
it
was
called
for
resentencing.
now
note
that
this
was
almost
two
and
a
half
years
after
the
original
sentence.
judge
walsh
again
presided.
the
defendants
were
not
present,
neither
was
mr.
frank
healey,
an
attorney
representing
mr.
donovan.
the
proceedings
nevertheless
commenced.
mr.
friedman
made
an
argument.
now
mr.
friedman's
representation
in
this
case
is
not
entirely
clear.
he
told
the
--
he
told
judge
walsh
that
at
this
particular
point
because
mr.
healey
was
not
present
that
he
represented
all
three
defendants.
the
docket
entries
show
and
the
judgment
show
that
he
represented
only
mr.
andrews
and
mr.
cohen,
and
that
mr.
healey
who
was
now
absent
represented
mr.
donovan.
in
any
event,
he
told
judge
walsh
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
prepare
the
memo
which
he
had
hoped
he
would
and
he
then
argued
two
points,
remember
now
this
is
in
the
absence
of
the
defendants.
he
argued
first
a
legal
point.
that
is
that
the
first
and
second
counts
didn't
merge
and
therefore
the
court
could
grant
some
sort
of
sentence
on
count
1.
secondly,
he
argued
a
non-legal
point.
he
made
a
plea
for
clemency.
now
mr.
mathews,
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
then
presented
an
argument
that
the
first
and
second
counts
did
merge
and
judge
walsh
at
that
point
called
a
recess.
after
the
recess,
the
defendants
and
mr.
healey
were
present
for
the
first
time
during
this
resentencing
procedure.
judge
walsh
asked,
“is
there
anything
you
want
to
say?”
and
this
question
was
answered
not
by
the
defendant,
not
by
mr.
friedman,
not
by
mr.
healey,
but
by
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,
mr.
mathews
who
then
proceeded
to
give
his
version
of
the
crime.
he
said
the
government
did
not
have
much
background
on
these
men
but
he
noted
that
the
court
at
this
point
had
a
presentence
report,
apparently,
the
first
one
in
the
case.
when
mr.
mathews
concluded,
mr.
friedman,
without
being
asked
then
spoke
up,
saying
that
he
was
going
to
speak
with
respect
to
andrews
and
cohen
and
that
mr.
healey
would
speak
with
respect
to
donovan.
mr.
friedman
made
a
plea
for
clemency
for
andrews
and
cohen,
and
mr.
healey
also
without
being
asked
by
the
court
spoke
up
and
made
a
plea
for
mr.
donovan.
when
they
were
through,
despite
the
fact
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
resentencing
was
to
consider
probation,
that
was
the
point
of
the
remand,
the
court
did
not
ask
any
defendant
whether
he
had
anything
to
say
either
in
litigation
sentence
or
on
his
own
behalf.
he
simply
proceeded
to
resentencing.
he
suspended
mr.
cohen's
sentence
and
put
him
on
probation.
he
ordered
the
prior
25-year
sentences
of
andrews
and
donovan
to
remain
in
effect.
on
april
17,
1961,
donovan
filed
a
motion
in
the
district
court.
he
claimed
that
his
right
of
allocution
under
rule
32
(a)
had
been
denied
him
and
he
prayed,
“that
the
sentence
aforesaid
be
vacated
and
he
be
resentenced.”
in
three
supporting
papers,
he
specifically
requested
that
this
motion
of
his
be
treated
as
a
rule
35
motion.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
of
course
part
of
his
delay
was
his
fault
in
the
sense
that
there
was
a
delay
between
the
resentencing
and
his
filing
of
this
motion.
i'd
like
to
point
out
however,
that
i
think
that
is
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
the
green
case
had
not
been
decided
at
that
time.
the
green
case
was
decided
four
or
five
months
before
he
filed
his
petition.
and
i
think
frankly,
this
was
the
first
time
he
knew
he
had
any
such
right,
and
that's
when
he
filed
his
--
his
petition
because
up
until
this
time,
neither
at
the
original
sentencing
nor
at
the
resentencing
did
anybody
ask
him
whether
he
had
anything
to
say.
now
rule
35,
of
course,
reads
in
part,
the
court
may
correct
an
illegal
sentence
at
anytime.
the
docket
entry
shows
that
donovan's
motion
was
entered
as
a
rule
35
motion.
the
court
--
the
government
stated
twice
in
pleadings
--
in
pleading
that
it
was
a
rule
35
motion.
and
judge
murphy
granted
the
motion
as
made
ordering
that
donovan
“be
returned
to
this
district
for
resentencing”.
now
andrews
apparently
heard
of
this
because
he
wrote
the
court
a
letter
under
date
of
january
25th,
1961,
asking
for
what
he
understood
to
be
the
same
treatment
that
had
been
accorded
donovan.
judge
murphy
treated
this
letter
as
a
motion.
he
granted
it
and
he
ordered
that
andrews
be
resentenced.
now,
note
that
neither
andrews
nor
judge
murphy,
nor
the
docket
clerk,
made
any
mention
of
28
u.s.c.
section
2255
in
relation
to
this
letter.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct.
that's
right.
green
had
been
decided,
hill
had
not.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
van
hook,
your
honor
came
down
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
after
--
after
--
you
see,
that
was
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
came
down
at
a
time
when
donovan
then
proceeded
to
file
a
motion
and
saying
--
said
in
effect,
“i
want
to
add
van
hook
as
another
reason
for
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
that's
right.
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
right,
right.
if
your
honor
will
turn
to
page
39
of
the
record,
you
will
see
that
van
hook
at
this
point
came
down
and
he
has
--
bringing
this
to
the
court's
attention.
this
is
all
on
his
own
now
without
benefit
of
counsel.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
hill
was
not
decided
until
january
22nd
of
1962
which
was
after
the
case
had
reached
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
now
both
donovan's
and
andrews'
motions
were
filed
in
the
original
criminal
case
with
the
original
criminal
docket
number.
the
first
mention
of
2255
that
got
into
this
case
at
all
was
in
a
government
affidavit
filed
one
day
after
andrews'
motion
had
been
granted
and
yet
in
that
same
affidavit,
the
government
conceded
that
the
factual
and
legal
posture
of
andrews'
motion
was
exactly
the
same
as
donovan's
motion.
note
too
that
when
andrews
found
out
that
the
government
was
treating
his
motion
as
a
2255
motion,
he
specifically
protested
in
a
pleading
and
claimed
that
his
motion
was
also
a
rule
35
motion.
the
government
appealed
from
both
of
judge
murphy's
orders
and
obtained
the
stay
pending
appeal.
all
of
the
government's
papers,
all
of
the
government's
papers
as
every
other
scrap
of
paper
in
this
case
that
was
filed
in
the
district
court
bore
the
original
criminal
docket
numbers.
andrews
and
donovan
were
not
allowed
bail
pending
appeal.
they
were
not
transferred
to
new
york,
to
help
prepare
for
their
appeal,
no
counsel
was
appointed
for
them,
they
wrote
their
own
briefs,
there
was
no
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals,
this
case
was
submitted
on
papers,
and
the
case
was
then
decided.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
because
judge
murphy
could
not
grant
any
relief
under
rule
35,
that
these
were
independent
motions
under
2255,
and
that
the
government
can
appeal
from
adverse
decisions
under
2255.
on
the
merits,
it
held
that
hill
versus
united
states
and
machibroda
versus
united
states,
both
of
which
had
now
come
down
in
the
meantime
required
reversal.
unfortunately,
the
court
of
appeals
was
under
a
misapprehension
as
to
the
facts
involved.
now
i
have
three
arguments.
i
want
to
stress
to
you
that
each
is
independent
of
the
other.
if
the
court
agrees
with
me
on
anyone
of
these,
the
court
of
appeals
must
be
reversed.
first,
whether
petitioner's
motions
were
civil
or
criminal,
whether
they
were
rule
35
or
2255,
whether
judge
--
what
judge
murphy
did
was
in
the
criminal
case
or
in
a
separate
proceeding,
these
were
entirely
interlocutory
and
non-final
orders.
they
were
interlocutory
in
nature,
in
cause
and
effect,
in
form,
in
result,
in
any
realistic
sense,
these
were
interlocutory
orders.
now
remember
these
orders
were
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
government
appealed
quickly
you
see,
before
these
men
can
be
brought
back
for
resentencing.
they
obtained
a
stay
and
immediately
appealed.
the
order
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
right,
that's
right.
these
men
stood
at
this
point
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
right,
but
convicted.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
convicted.
now
these
orders
were
in
two
parts.
they
vacated
the
prior
sentences
and
they
ordered
resentencing.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
a
stay
of
both
of
judge
murphy's
orders
as
entered.
that
is
the
prior
convictions
are
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
technically
as
of
this
moment,
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
since
those
orders
were
stayed
that
they
stand
convicted
and
sentenced
as
originally.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct,
but
as
of
the
moment,
he
ruled
in
between
then
and
the
time
that
they
obtained
to
stay,
of
course,
they
stood
convicted
but
non
--
not
sentenced
and
the
stay
was
based
solely
upon
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
appeal
which
is
the
very
issue
in
question
here.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
now
resentencing,
as
i
said,
has
not
taken
place.
the
criminal
case
is
open
and
i
again,
with
the
exception
of
the
fact
that
the
stay
was
entered.
i
think
we
can
ignore
that
fact
for
the
purposes
of
this
situation
because
if
the
appeal
will
not
lie,
he
had
no
right
of
course
to
grant
a
stay.
as
of
that
time,
a
resentencing
had
not
taken
place.
the
criminal
case
was
open
as
the
government
concedes.
the
government
concedes
that.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
the
first
one,
your
honor
is
on
page
40,
that's
correct.
no
settlement
is
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
--
and
the
other
one
is
just
two
lines
on
page
50.
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
completely.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
right.
these
were
self
executing
orders.
this
court
on
numerous
occasions
has
made
clear
that
final
judgment
in
a
criminal
case
means
sentence.
there
can
be
no
question
about
that.
now,
i
need
not
even
pause
over
these
situation
if
the
orders
were
correctly
rule
35
orders,
because
the
government
clearly
cannot
appeal
even
from
final
orders
in
a
criminal
case
unless
authorized
by
18
u.s.c.
section
3731.
the
government
doesn't
even
claim
that
right
in
this
case,
but
the
government
said,
“what
judge
murphy
did
was
to
grant
independent
petitions
under
2255.”
now
even
if
these
were
true,
it
doesn't
follow
that
the
government
could
appeal
as
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
have
assumed.
2255
by
its
own
terms,
allows
that
appeal
as
from
a
final
judgment
on
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
2253
allows
an
appeal
in
habeas
corpus
only
from
final
orders.
the
government
doesn't
claim
that
judge
murphy's
orders
were
--
had
the
effect
of
finality.
it
concedes
that
the
criminal
case
is
now
open
but
for
the
stay.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
open.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
open.
that
is
that
it's
incomplete,
that
orders
still
have
to
be
entered.
what
the
government
says
in
effect
that
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
2255,
your
honor,
gives
--
in
the
first
place,
2255
applies
to
a
prisoner
claiming
to
be
--
claiming
the
right
to
be
released.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
now
these
--
these
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
that's
right.
now
these
men
are
not
claiming
the
right
to
be
released.
these
men
have
been
--
claimed
the
right
to
be
resentenced.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
in
that
sense
released,
but
they're
not
released
from
custody.
i
take
this
language
to
mean
release
from
custody.
they're
talking
about
getting
out
from
under
the
cause
of
the
government
and
these
men
are
not
released
from
custody
when
they're
simply
transferred
from
alcatraz
and
louisburg
under
guard
to
the
court
to
be
resentenced.
but
further,
note
that
the
--
that
2255
allows
the
court
to
vacate
and
set
aside
the
judgment
--
the
judgment
and
it
can
discharge
or
it
can
resentence
or
it
can
grant
a
new
trial
or
it
can
correct
the
sentence.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
exactly,
and
that's
what
is
tradition.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
right.
it's
traditionally
been
used
for
that.
now,
as
i
say,
what
the
government
says
in
effect
here,
i
think,
is
this.
technically,
since
judge
murphy
properly
could
only
vacate
the
sentence
and
since
the
resentencing
will
be
in
the
criminal
case,
this
is
the
last
order
that
will
be
entered
in
the
2255
proceeding.
that's
the
way
i
interpret
their
brief
as
trying
to
call
for
some
element
of
finality
here.
well,
now
first,
let's
assume
that
this
is
rule
35
proceeding.
rule
35
doesn't
say
the
court
may
vacate
an
illegal
sentence.
it
says
the
court
may
correct
an
illegal
sentence,
and
unless
the
correction
is
a
reduction
within
60
days,
the
defendants
have
to
be
present.
so
that
it
reads
as
if
it's
to
say
--
as
if
it
says,
the
court
may
set
aside
and
order
resentencing.
now
under
2255,
if
that's
what
this
is,
the
court
as
i
just
pointed
out
specifically
given
the
power
both
to
correct
and
to
resentence.
so
i
think
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
judge
murphy
had
the
power
to
vacate
and
to
order
resentencing
in
this
case.
now
secondly,
i
don't
concede
that
other
things
couldn't
happen
in
this
2255
proceeding,
assuming
that
that's
what
it
was.
if
his
order
for
example
were
not
followed
--
were
not
followed
up
there
could
be
new
motions
in
the
2255
proceeding
and
thirdly,
even
if
the
2255
proceeding,
if
that's
what
it
is,
were
now
over.
that
is
not
what
this
court
has
said
the
finality
means.
in
collins
versus
miller,
final
orders
were
entered
in
the
sense
asked
for
by
the
government
here.
but
this
court
held
that
they
were
not
final,
a
further
extradition
hearing
had
to
be
held.
the
whole
subject
matter,
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
phrase
used
by
the
court;
the
whole
subject
matter
had
not
been
disposed
off.
now,
similar
holdings
had
been
made
in
cases
citing
on
--
cited
on
pages
20
to
23
of
my
brief.
and
so
here,
judge
murphy's
orders
will
not
be
final
until
what
he
ordered
to
be
done
is
done.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
first
of
course
your
honor,
i
don't
think
this
is
2255.
you
understand
that
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
right.
now
assuming
that
is
rule
--
that
it's
2255,
i
don't
concede
that
it
is
over
necessarily.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
he
ordered
it
right
in
the
same
--
right
in
the
same
order.
he
didn't
just
vacate
the
prior
sentence.
he
ordered
that
they'd
be
resentenced.
now
until
that
is
done,
i
can
easily
visualize
motions
being
filed,
for
example,
if
they
--
if
they
refused
to
do
it
or
if
there
was
an
undue
delay,
or
other
things.
it
was
the
order
entered
in
2255
if
that's
what
it
was,
it
must
still
be
carried
out.
but
finally,
even
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
would
be
my
contention
that
they
were.
that
isn't
the
contention
that
the
government
made.
the
government
defeated
bail
on
the
ground
that
this
was
2255.
now
even
assuming
however,
your
honor,
that
technically
speaking,
this
was
2255
and
2255
is
over
in
the
sense
that
there's
nothing
more
to
be
done
in
2255,
i
certainly
don't
think
that
that
is
conclusive
in
any
way
because
in
collins
versus
miller,
the
court
refused
to
look
at
this
type
of
situation
in
any
technical
legalistic
sense
of
what
is
over
and
something
else
is
opened
up.
the
whole
subject
matter
here
is
the
question
of
resentencing.
this
is
one
ball
of
wax
until
the
resentencing
takes
place
necessarily
the
subject
matter
is
still
open.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
wasn't
going
to
get
to
it,
but
i
will.
i
don't
know
that
the
government
could.
i
have
not
taken
a
position
on
that
because
i
would
like
to
be
in
a
position
assuming
that
they
tried
to
appeal
following
resentencing
to
say
that
they
couldn't.
i
would
note
that
the
government
obtained
an
appeal
in
williamson,
but
i
would
say
this.
when
the
resentencing
takes
place,
it's
clearly
going
to
take
place
in
the
criminal
case
and
it
would
be
my
view
that
the
government
could
not
under
3731
appeal
that,
but
your
honor,
let's
assume
that
the
government
totally
loses
the
right
to
appeal
now
if
it's
not
allowed
to
appeal.
that
hasn't
influenced
this
court
in
cases
like
carroll
or
dibella
that
same
argument,
exactly
the
same
argument
is
made
by
the
government
there.
if
we're
not
allowed
to
appeal
these
motions
to
suppress,
now
at
this
point,
we
will
lose
forever
the
right
to
appeal.
and
the
court
said
in
effect
that's
too
bad.
that's
just
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
then
the
government
tried
to
appeal
from
the
resentencing.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
you
mean
from
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
it
could
do
that,
your
honor.
the
order
was
that
the
--
that
the
prior
sentence
was
vacated
and
that
these
men
are
now
resentenced
to
25
years.
in
the
first
place,
that
would
be
illegal
because
it
was
done
out
of
their
presence.
but
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
assume
they
were
there.
then
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
they
are
not
allowed
to
appeal
because
the
re
--
that
part
of
it
which
resentenced
was
necessarily
part
of
the
criminal
case.
you
see,
at
that
point,
just
in
the
flash
of
a
moment
before
he
resentenced,
they're
in
the
same
position
as
if
they
have
been
convicted
by
the
jury
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
that's
this
case
up
until
the
next
day,
that's
this
case.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
because
the
government
doesn't
stay?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
practically
don't
think
that
the
stay
is
determinative
myself,
your
honor.
i
mean
i
don't
see
that
you
--
that
you
convert
this
into
a
legal
appeal
because
they
walk
in
and
get
a
stay
of
an
order
from
which
they
cannot
appeal.
now,
i'd
like
the
court
to
look
at
what
the
government
is
really
asking
it
to
do
here.
let's
suppose
that
the
petitioners
after
they
had
been
convicted
by
the
jury,
but
before
they
had
been
sentenced,
had
rushed
in
with
a
habeas
corpus
petition
attacking
their
conviction.
now,
is
there
any
question
but
that
an
appellate
court
assuming
that
that
was
denied,
let's
assume
it
was
denied
so
they
try
to
take
an
appeal,
they
say
it's
the
final
order,
is
there
any
question
but
that
an
appellate
court
would
dismiss
the
appeal
on
the
ground
that
this
was
a
non-final
proceeding,
that
this
was
non-final
in
every
way.
if
that,
i
--
i
think
that
is
precisely
what
the
government
is
asking
you
to
rule
here
in
effect.
the
government
says
that
even
though
had
they
--
have
yet
to
be
resentenced,
it
can
rush
in
an
appeal
because
an
order
has
been
entered
in
the
2255
proceeding.
if
it
can,
if
the
government
can
appeal
here,
i
can
assure
you
that
there's
going
to
be
a
great
revision
in
collateral
attack
procedures,
not
only
by
the
government,
but
by
petitioners,
but
by
defendants.
the
whole
purpose
--
the
whole
purpose
and
thrust
of
carroll
and
dibella
is
going
to
be
diluted
completely.
if
the
government
can
appeal,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
finality
rule
to
prevent
piecemeal,
truncated
appeals,
to
prevent
and
let
them
put
injustice
will
be
frustrated.
now
remember
judge
murphy's
orders
were
--
were
entered
in
june
and
july
of
1961.
over
a
year
and
a
half
ago
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
they
can't
bring
habeas
corpus
because
they
haven't
been
sentenced
yet.
but
let's
--
let's
assume
they
can
bring
--
they
can't
bring
2255
because
they
haven't
been
sentenced
but
they
can
bring
--
let's
assume,
they
rushed
in
with
habeas
corpus.
in
other
words,
they've
been
convicted,
they
haven't
been
sentenced.
they
come
in
and
file
habeas
corpus
attacking
their
conviction.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
2255
would
be
ineffective
in
that
situation
because
it
wouldn't
lie.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
right.
so
let's
say
they
come
in
under
habeas
corpus
and
attack
their
conviction
and
say
this
was
--
conviction
was
illegal
for
any
number
of
reasons,
denied,
they
haven't
been
sentenced
yet.
then
they
appeal.
then
they
say
that
was
a
final
order
because
it
was
a
final
order
in
habeas
corpus
and
that's
all
there
is
to
be
done
in
habeas
corpus.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
prisoner
would.
i
think
there's
no
question
but
that
an
appellate
court
would
say,
“you
are
trying
to
appeal
--
we
will
dismiss
this
appeal,
this
is
non-final
because
you
have
not
been
sentenced.
you
cannot
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
some
are
and
some
aren't,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
this
court
is
held
your
honor
that
as
i
understand
it,
that
bail
is
a
sufficient
custody
of
the
prisoner
to
allow
and
to
file
habeas
corpus,
tell
that
in
a
state
case.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
much
more
so
to
the
government.
this
court
has
held
obviously
that
this
is
a
much
more
stringent
rule
applied
to
the
government
in
criminal
cases
than
in
the
alike.
now,
as
i
pointed
out,
judge
murphy's
orders
directing
that
these
men
be
resentenced
who
were
entered
a
year
and
a
half
ago.
now,
surely
this
is
laden
footed
justice.
it's
a
denial,
i
think
of
the
very
right
which
judge
murphy
ordered
that
these
men
receive,
the
right
to
be
legally
resentenced.
now,
there
is
a
second
independent
ground
why
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
totally,
aside
from
any
question
of
finality
now,
these
were
orders,
i
think,
in
the
criminal
case.
and
section
3731
does
not
allow
the
government
appeal
to
appeal
from
such
orders.
the
government
doesn't
claim
the
right
to
appeal
here
if
these
were
rule
35
orders.
now,
clearly,
the
orders
were
treated
as
rule
35
orders.
i
can
--
i
think
there
can
be
no
question
about
that.
they
were
treated
by
the
parties
and
by
the
court
and
by
the
docket
clerk
as
rule
35
orders,
but
the
government
says
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
enter
a
rule
35
order.
now
it's
quite
true
that
the
concluding
paragraph
in
your
honors
opinion
in
hill
versus
united
states
intimates
that
rule
35
is
not
the
proper
remedy
even
where
they're
aggravating
circumstances
to
accompany
the
denial
of
the
right
of
allocution,
but
even
hill
doesn't
suggest
that
judge
murphy's
orders
were
void.
moreover
with
great
respect,
i
think
the
court
should
reconsider
the
question
in
hill
as
to
whether
this
should
not
be
a
rule
35
order,
a
rule
35
motion,
whether
rule
35
doesn't
properly
lie
here
as
a
remedy.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
it's
an
alternative
ground
completely.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
position
i
take
is
that
clearly,
if
it's
a
rule
35
motion,
they
cannot
appeal,
they're
going
to
complain
that.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
doubt.
and
all
i'm
saying
is
that
this
--
this
was
treated
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--
as
a
rule
35
motion,
that
he
had
jurisdiction
under
a
rule
35
motion.
he
may
have
been
mistaken
but
that's
what
he
did.
he
had
jurisdiction
to
do
it
and
that
being
the
case,
the
government
can
appeal
from
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
labels
don't
count.
the
label
in
this
case
is
being
used
to
the
--
in
effect
to
defeat
the
right
of
resentencing.
a
rule
35
motion
has
been
converted
into
a
2255
proceeding
in
order
to
try
to
make
it
civil
so
that
they
can
appeal
from
what
--
otherwise
they
would
(inaudible).
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
right.
now,
i
point
out
on
pages
33
to
34
of
my
brief
and
pages
8
to
9
of
my
reply
brief,
some
of
the
consequences
of
such
a
ruling
that
rule
35
is
not
available
here
including
the
fact
that
in
some
instances,
it's
got
to
be
rule
35
or
nothing.
and
i
will
not
repeat
those
arguments
here.
i
want
to
add
only
this.
the
majority
in
hill
seems
to
have
assumed
that
rule
35
traditionally
has
been
used
to
attack
only
sentences
void
on
their
face
whereas
2255
is
traditionally
been
used
in
situations
more
akin
to
this
one.
but
rule
--
but
2255
as
i've
said
by
its
own
terms,
doesn't
apply
to
this
situation
because
these
men
are
not
seeking
to
be
released
from
custody.
moreover,
it's
traditionally
been
used
to
attack
the
judgment
of
conviction
which
is
not
being
attacked
here.
there's
no
attack
on
the
judgment.
there
is
no
request
for
a
new
trial
in
this
case.
moreover,
the
government
itself
does
not
dispute
some
cases
where
the
absence
of
the
defendant
was
a
ground
for
rule
35
relief,
on
page
14
of
its
brief.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
real
rule
in
relation
to
rule
35
is
that
strongly
intimated
in
heflin
and
that
is
that
rule
35
maybe
used
to
attack
the
legality
of
any
sentence
unless,
unless
that
the
effect
does
not
appear
from
the
face
of
the
record.
in
other
words,
unless
a
hearing
must
be
held
to
determine
the
true
facts
and
no
hearing
was
necessary
here
and
none
withheld.
if
the
court
finds
it
necessary
to
reach
this
question,
as
i
hope
it
will
not,
i
hope
that
it
will
reconsider
its
concluding
paragraph
in
hill
at
least
where
aggravating
circumstances
are
present.
rule
35,
i
contend
was
quite
as
appropriate
a
method
as
2255
to
do
what
was
done
here
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
so
far
neater
and
more
expeditious
method
of
doing
it.
now,
there's
a
third
independent
ground
for
reversal
here.
if
the
court
should
find
that
judge
murphy's
orders
were
interlocutory,
if
it
should
find
further
that
the
orders
were
not
entered
in
the
criminal
case,
then
and
only
then,
we
reach
the
question
of
whether
his
orders
were
correct.
now,
first,
let
me
say
that
they
were
clearly
correct
at
the
time
that
they
were
entered
because
at
that
time,
green
had
been
decided
and
eight
members
of
this
court
clearly
thought
that
rule
35
was
the
appropriate
remedy
because
that
was
a
rule
35
case.
now
hill
had
not
been
decided
and
even
under
hill,
which
was
later
decided,
judge
murphy,
i
think
was
right
in
his
result
because
this
case
contains
a
number
of
the
so-called
aggravating
circumstances
of
a
fundamental
nature
and
hill
recognizes
that
some
--
such
circumstances
came
relay
the
sentence
open
to
collateral
attack.
with
great
respect,
i
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
suggest
--
did
not
state
actively
what
actually
occurred
here.
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
have
assumed
that
the
question
of,
“do
you
have
something
to
say”
was
asked
of
a
defense
attorney
which
would
bring
the
case
more
in
line
with
green.
actually,
the
question
was
asked
to
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
and
no
question
was
ever
asked
of
the
defendants
or
their
attorneys
at
all,
although
they
spoke.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
they
did.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
they
did.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
spoke
and
then
mr.
friedman
spoke
without
being
asked
and
then
mr.
healey
spoke
again
without
being
asked.
i
think
the
importance
of
the
point
is
that
i
think
in
green,
the
court
assumed
that
if
the
question
had
been
directed
to
the
defendants,
even
though
it's
been
answered
by
his
attorney,
he
at
least
knew
that
he
had
a
right
to
speak
and
could
presumably
have
spoken
up.
in
this
case,
where
the
only
question
asked
is
asked
by
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
and
then
the
two
attorneys
have
to
get
up
on
their
own
to
interject
what
they
had
to
say.
clearly,
there's
no
way
for
the
defendants
to
know
that
they
have
a
right
to
speak.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
for
probations.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct,
which
is
exactly
what
he
did
to
mr.
cohen.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
right.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
defendants
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--
made
a
motion
on
resentencing
if
we
ever
reach
resentencing
in
your
honor
that
in
fact
they
could
be
a
sentenced
to
something
else
on
a
legal
ground
on
the
--
on
the
basis
that
would
charge
the
jury
perhaps
on
the
basis
of
the
merger
of
the
first
two
counts
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
it
has.
i'm
--
there's
some
question
whether
the
whole
thing
wouldn't
be
opened
up
on
resentencing
and
they
might
be
able
to
plead
that,
but
i
think
for
our
present
purposes
we
can
assume
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
certainly
is.
your
honor,
in
green,
i
think
that
the
court
with
great
respect,
i
think
it
was
sort
of
shall
we
say
assuming
quite
a
bit
in
terms
of
the
question
that
was
asked
and
who
it
was
asked
off.
but
in
green
at
least
the
court
said,
when
you
ask
--
when
you
ask
a
question
and
it's
answered
by
the
defense
attorney,
it's
easy
to
see
how
that
attorn
--
that
question
could
be
answered
by
defendants
and
then
the
attorneys
in
effect
are
saying,
“we'll
speak
for
them.”
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
inconceivable
to
assume
that
a
question
could
be
asked
of
the
defendants,
“do
you
have
anything
to
say”
and
the
man
who
answers
the
question
and
who
speaks
up
in
effect
on
their
behalf
is
the
assistant
united
states
attorney.
so
that's
what
i
base
it
on.
now,
i've
covered
in
my
brief
and
my
reply
brief
and
i
will
not
reargue
here
such
matters
as
mr.
healey's
absence
during
part
of
the
resentencing
procedure.
i'm
now
talking
about
aggravating
circumstances.
judge
walsh's
mistake
of
fact
as
to
andrews'
part
in
the
crime,
mr.
donovan's
record,
the
failure
to
grant
the
right
of
allocution
at
the
first
sentencing,
and
things
of
this
sort.
i
want
to
add
here
only
a
few
remarks
about
the
absence
of
the
defendants
during
this
resentencing
procedure.
it
seems
to
me
that
rules
43
and
32
are
not
separate
rules,
but
complementary.
rule
43
provides
that
the
defendant
must
be
present
at
every
stage
of
the
trial
and
at
the
imposition
of
sentence.
rule
32
guarantees
him
the
right
to
speak
in
mitigation
of
sentence
and
in
his
own
behalf.
now
i
think
that
these
rules
recognize
that
there's
no
point
in
the
defendant
being
present
if
he
can't
speak,
and
that
his
right
to
speak
is
meaningless
if
he
wasn't
present
at
every
stage
of
what
went
before.
these
petitioners
were
denied
both
rights.
they
missed
a
legal
argument.
they
missed
a
plea
for
clemency.
they
had
never
spoken
at
their
original
sentencing.
they
have
not
spoken
to
this
day
more
than
eight
years
after
they
originally
sentenced
them.
surely,
i
think
that
they're
entitled
to
what
judge
murphy
has
ordered
that
they'd
be
given.
now
in
conclusion,
your
honor,
i
just
have
one
comment.
i
pointed
out
on
page
15
on
my
reply
brief
that
according
to
the
administrative
office
of
the
united
states
courts,
of
the
almost
600
motions
to
set
aside
are
correct
sentences
filed
during
fiscal
1962
under
both
2255
and
rule
35,
only
18
resulted
in
the
granting
of
some
form
of
relief.
now
subsequent
to
my
reply
brief,
i
have
the
administrative
office
check
to
determine
how
many
government
appeals
were
taken
or
attempted
in
any
of
these
actions
and
i
might
say
that
i
have
informed
mr.
barnett
the
results
of
that
request.
there
were
169
appeals
taken
during
fiscal
1962.
not
a
single
one
of
them
was
taken
or
attempted
by
the
government.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
might
be.
it
might
well
be.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--
may
it
please
the
court.
unless
the
court
has
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
touch
on
one
preliminary
factual
question
raised
by
the
chief
justice
and
then
i
want
to
turn
immediately
to
the
very
basic
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
goldberg.
in
regard
to
mr.
andrews'
letter,
the
letter
itself
was
simply
a
letter.
the
clerk
apparently
put
the
criminal
docket
number
on
it.
on
record,
page
10,
you'll
see
the
way
he
entered
it
in
which
he
made
no
reference
to
either
2255
or
rule
35.
it
was
granted
without
any
reference
to
what
it
was
but
it
bore
that
original
criminal
docket
number.
then
when
mr.
andrews
found,
the
government
was
suddenly
referring
to
his
letter
as
a
2255
letter,
he
protested
that
specifically
and
requested
that
it
would
be
treated
as
a
rule
35
motion,
but
all
of
this
to
one
side,
the
government
has
conceded
on
the
record
that
this
was
exactly
the
same
as
donovan's
and
it
has
now
told
you
that
donovan's
was
a
rule
35.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
of
course
not.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
exactly,
exactly
and
the
government
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
exactly,
exactly.
but
the
government
in
addition
and
i
quote
now
from
record
51,
the
factual
and
legal
posture
of
this
application,
that
is
the
letter,
therefore
is
identical
to
the
similar
motion
of
robert
l.
donovan.
it
seems
to
me
that
forecloses
that
question.
now,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
have
not
argued
that
rule
32
(a)
or
denial
of
rule
32
(a)
denies
due
process
per
se
because
i
have
not
had
to
on
this
record,
but
i
can
assure
you
that
it's
my
personal
view
that
it
does.
but
whether
it
does
or
not,
certainly,
there
is
a
denial
of
due
process
in
the
context
of
the
situation
in
this
case
where
you
have
the
absence
of
the
defendants
during
a
crucial
stage
of
the
sentencing
process
where
you
have
the
absence
of
one
attorney
where
you
have
a
misapprehension
as
to
a
vital
fact
and
i
do
not
agree
with
great
respect
to
mr.
barnett's
characterization
of
the
judge's
misunderstanding
but
i
will
not
go
into
that,
it's
in
my
brief,
with
the
fact
that
we
have
donovan's
record
here
and
the
fact
that
you
have
two
denials
in
the
same
case
of
the
right
of
allocution.
all
of
these
together,
the
sum
total
of
the
circumstances,
clearly,
it
seems
to
me,
amounts
to
a
denial
of
due
process.
now
the
importance
of
the
right
of
allocution
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
is
pointed
out
by
a
chance
remark
that
was
made
here
that
if
you
have
a
mandatory
sentence
and
if
the
judge
could
not
have
given
probation,
why
of
course
the
denial
of
the
right
to
speak
was
not
important,
not
so.
rule
32
(a)
gives
two
rights,
the
right
to
speak
in
mitigation
of
sentence
and
that
would
go
to
the
situation
i
was
just
stating,
but
also
the
right
to
speak
in
your
own
behalf.
now,
in
regard
to
the
right
to
speak
in
your
own
behalf,
that's
not
just
talking
about
the
sentence,
this
maybe
the
first
time
the
man
has
had
a
chance
to
speak
and
that
is
true
in
this
case
because
mr.
cohen
testified,
but
mr.
andrews
and
mr.
donovan
did
not.
so
we
reach
the
conclusion
of
the
case,
we
reach
this
vital
stage
where
these
men
are
about
to
be
sentenced
and
this
is
the
first
chance
that
they
have
had
to
get
on
their
feet
and
say
anything
that
they
want
to
say,
i
have
been
defrauded,
my
counsel
has
not
represented
me,
i
want
to
get
on
the
stand,
this
witness
like
the
sentence
is
beyond
the
mandatory,
the
sentence
is
not
in
accordance
with
your
--
the
judge's
instructions
to
the
jury,
any
number
of
things.
this
is
his
chance
to
speak
and
i
say
regardless
of
what
the
sentence
is,
regardless
of
whether
probation
is
involved
or
not,
that
man
at
this
point
has
a
right
to
speak
and
should
be
granted
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
now,
your
honor,
will
you
turn
please
to
record
30,
fourteen
lines
down,
mr.
healey
is
speaking.
he
has
been
speaking
about
mr.
donovan
--
yes,
mr.
donovan
and
he
says,
“i
could
go
on
with
other
things
that
i
have
here
in
my
notes.”
i
could
go
on
with
other
things
but
i
won't.
now,
what
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
i
have
had
this
difficulty
in
this
case
your
honor.
i
have
one
client
who
has
been
in
lewisburg,
pennsylvania.
i
have
had
another
until
recently
who
has
been
in
alcatraz
and
i
have
no
idea
where
he
is
at
the
moment.
our
mail
is
censored
and
consequently,
i
have
had
some
difficulty
frankly
in
getting
it
straightened
out
with
my
clients
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
there
was
no
necessity
for
making
the
record
because
the
motion
was
granted.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
it
doesn't
but
it's
not
his
fault
that
the
record
doesn't
show
it.
well,
i
just
wanted
to
make
that
point
because
when
he
filed
his
motion,
you
see,
there
wasn't
even
a
hearing.
the
judge
simply
looked
at
the
record
and
he
said
“motion
granted.”
now,
so
on
the
question
of
full
disclosure,
the
counsel
for
the
government
says,
“well,
there's
no
problem
here
because
there's
a
full
disclosure
of
everything
they
wanted
to
say.
the
government
--
the
defense
counsel
spoke
at
length.
we
don't
know.
that
is
an
assumption.
we
don't
know
what
they
would
have
said.
we
don't
know
whether
there
was
a
full
disclosure
or
not.
as
i've
pointed
out,
they
didn't
testified
the
trial,
they
weren't
granted
the
right
of
allocution
the
first
time
or
the
second
time
so
we
have
no
idea
what
they're
going
to
say
as
of
this
juncture.
now
the
government
says,
well,
they
didn't
ask
to
speak
and
they
didn't
raise
the
question
in
their
first
appeal.
may
i
ask
how
they
knew
they
had
the
right
to
speak?
nothing
was
indicated
anywhere
in
this
record
indicating
until
green
was
decided
that
they
had
the
right
to
speak.
but
further
on
their
appeal,
they
were
represented
by
the
very
gentleman
and
i
do
not
say
this
adversely
to
the
counsel
but
they
were
represented
by
the
very
gentlemen
who
were
in
effect
responsible
for
they're
not
speaking
in
the
sense
that
they
spoke
in
place
of
this
man
and
quite
obviously,
it
seems
to
me
it's
rather
strange
--
it
would
be
a
strange
situation
for
them
then
to
turnaround
on
appeal
on
the
ground
that
they
have
not
protected
this
right
of
their
clients.
now,
i'll
say
only
one
word
in
regard
to
this
finality
question.
it's
interesting
that
in
the
--
as
you
know,
2255
came
as
--
came
about
as
a
result
of
rec
--
number
of
recommendations
from
the
judicial
conference
which
finally
resolved
in
an
extended
bills
before
congress.
and
one
of
the
original
suggestions
that
was
made
by
the
judicial
conference
as
the
language
for
rules
or
for
section
2255
and
this
appears
in
the
report
for
1953
--
1943
i
am
sorry
on
page
44,
“the
wording
in
regard
to
appealability
was
an
appeal
from
an
order
granting
or
denying
the
motion
shall
lie
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.”
now,
i
cannot
find
in
the
legislative
history
the
reason
why
that
was
changed.
the
legislative
history
is
somewhat
involved
here,
but
it
was
changed
and
it
was
obviously
changed
with
a
view
to
adding
this
idea
of
finality.
they
didn't
want
2255
appeals
to
lie
simply
from
an
order
entered.
they
wanted
to
lie
only
from
final
order
and
that
was
the
language
they
used.
now
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
order
was
entered
whether
it
would
be
rule
35
or
2255
which
both
vacated
sentences
and
ordered
resentencing
and
that
i
say
did
not
on
its
face
and
in
effect
have
any
semblance
of
finality.
now,
in
conclusion,
i
think
we
ought
to
look
finally
the
end
of
this
case
as
a
practical
matter
that
what
is
involved
here
and
what
the
government
is
asking
you
to
do.
what
is
the
effect
of
allowing
the
government
an
appeal
in
this
type
of
situation?
since
these
petitioners
have
now
served
their
five-year
sentence,
remember
that
was
on
count
three,
every
single
day
that
passes
now
in
this
interlocutory
appeal
stage
is
a
day
which
these
defendants
if
they
could
prove
to
the
district
court
on
resentencing
that
they
were
entitled
to
probation,
everyday
that
goes
by
is
a
day
that
they
would
be
free.
in
the
case
of
short
sentences,
the
government
can
totally
defeat
the
right
of
resentencing
by
the
simple
act
of
appeal.
you
get
a
man
who
is
sentenced
to
a
year-and-a-half
which
has
been
the
time
since
the
order
of
judge
murphy
was
entered
and
the
government
notes
its
appeal,
it
takes
its
time,
it
writes
its
brief,
it
goes
up,
receives
cert,
and
then
at
the
end
of
that
time,
the
order
of
resentencing
was
correct,
too
late,
it's
all
over.
that's
what
the
government
is
asking
you
to
do
in
this
case
and
i
think
that
the
figures
which
i
cited
to
you
at
the
end
of
yesterday,
in
terms
of
the
time
the
government
sought
in
the
last
fiscal
year,
any
type
of
repeal,
namely
none
is
an
indication
not
only
that
this
right
is
not
necessary
and
that
they
do
not
really
need
it,
but
as
shown
by
the
facts
of
this
case
that
it
actually
denies
the
right
which
we're
all
seeking
to
protect.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
thank
you.
