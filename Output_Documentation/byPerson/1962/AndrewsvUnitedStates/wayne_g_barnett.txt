mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
propose
if
i
may
to
reverse
mr.
prettyman's
order
of
argument
into
your
first
question
on
the
merits
and
second
with
the
question
of
appealability.
on
the
merits,
we
concede
that
the
failure
of
judge
walsh
at
the
sentencing
proceedings
specifically
to
ask
the
defendants
if
they
had
anything
to
say
before
being
sentenced
was
not
inconformity
with
rule
32
(a)
and
therefore,
was
reversible
error
under
this
court's
decisions
in
green
and
van
hook
cases
on
direct
appeal.
i
might
say
--
i
think
it's
pertinent
to
note
that
that
was
not
clear
at
the
time
in
1957.
there
was
a
considerable
body
of
thought
since
the
rule
--
although
the
rule
requires
that
the
judge
shall
afford
an
opportunity
that
didn't
necessarily
require
that
he's
specifically
address
each
defendant,
particularly
where
as
here,
they're
represented
by
counsel
and
the
counsel
had
made
a
full
statement
in
their
behalf.
nevertheless,
the
court
so
held
and
we
don't
challenge
that.
nor
do
we
question
as
a
fact
that
he'd
failed
to
make
that
inquiry
in
this
case.
i
think
in
truth,
the
error
occurred
only
at
the
second
proceeding
in
1957.
the
first
proceeding,
judge
walsh
was
acting
under
the
appre
--
misapprehensions
as
it
turned
out
that
this
sentence
was
mandatory.
he
had
no
choice
about
the
matter
and
i
doubt
that
a
failure
to
afford
an
opportunity
to
the
defendant
to
speak
would
even
be
a
reversible
error
in
the
case
of
a
mandatory
sentence,
but
nevertheless
on
remand,
he
should
have
done
it
and
did
not,
and
we
agree
that
that
was
error.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
judge
walsh,
at
that
time,
believed
not
and
so
his
error
was
in
that
belief
and
not
in
affording
--
failing
to
afford
an
opportunity
to
speak.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
he
was
--
if
he
was
right
on
the
law,
i
don't
think
there
was
an
error
in
it
to
say
to
let
them
speak.
he
was
wrong
in
the
law
and
that's
why
it
was
reversed
and
he
should
have
given
an
opportunity
to
speak
at
the
second
trial.
the
only
question
here
is
having
failed
to
raise
that
question
on
direct
appeal
even
though
they
appealed
from
both
sentencing
procedures,
can
they
in
a
collateral
proceeding,
brought
some
more
than
six
years
after
the
original
sentence,
more
than
four
years
after
the
reaffirmation
of
the
sentence,
can
they
then
set
aside
the
sentence
in
a
collateral
proceeding
for
that
failure.
this
court
held
only
last
term,
14
months
ago
in
hill
and
machibroda
that
they
cannot
that
the
mere
failure
to
specifically
invite
the
defendants
to
speak
before
sentencing
is
not
such
a
basic
fundamental
defect
in
the
proceedings
as
to
warrant
a
collateral
vacation
of
the
sentence.
now,
i
would
deal
with
the
question
first
in
terms
of
section
2255
and
the
court
acknowledged
that
section
2255
was
the
proper
procedure
in
which
to
question
irregularities
in
the
sentencing
proceedings,
but
said
that
this
was
not
a
sufficient
showing
of
the
kind
of
fundamental
error
that
would
warrant
the
relief.
now
petitioners
here
suggest
that
there
are
additional
circumstances
present
in
the
case
which
altogether
do
add
up
to
a
fundamental
defect,
a
question
which
of
course
was
left
open
in
hill.
they
point
basically
to
two
circumstances.
the
first
are
the
events
transpiring
at
pages
20
to
25
of
the
record.
the
--
after
the
first
sentence
was
remanded
for
reconsideration,
the
case
was
called
on
may
15th,
1957
and
mr.
friedlander
--
mr.
friedman
representing
as
he
then
said,
all
three
defendants
and
he
said
that
by
the
way
in
the
presence
of
mr.
healey
who
was
normally
the
attorney
of
record
for
mr.
donovan
and
mr.
donovan
did
not
object,
asked
for
a
continuance
so
they
might
prepare
a
brief
on
the
question
of
the
court's
powers
in
the
sentencing.
a
continuance
was
granted
to
may
20th.
on
may
20th,
the
case
was
called
and
after
the
attorneys
of
--
the
united
states
attorney
and
mr.
friedman
announced
that
they
were
ready,
the
court
asked
if
the
defendants
were
present,
mr.
friedman
said,
“no,
they're
on
their
way
up.”
the
judge
said,
“alright.”
mr.
friedman
then
apologized
for
not
having
the
brief
he
had
promised
to
supply.
the
court
said,
“yes”
and
at
that
point,
mr.
friedman,
on
his
own
without
any
other
cue,
proceeded
to
deliver
an
oral
argument
on
the
question
initially
of
the
court's
powers
on
resentencing.
now
during
the
course
of
that
argument
which
the
judge
did
not
object
to,
he
referred
to
several
circumstances
that
would
bear
on
the
sentencing
question
namely
that
they've
been
in
jail
for
two
years
and
eight
months
and
he
hope
the
court
would
take
that
into
account,
and
secondly,
that
the
court
had
at
the
original
sentencing
expressed
some
dissatisfaction
with
having
to
give
a
25-year
sentence
and
perhaps
having
greater
discretion
wouldn't
have.that's
all
that
he
said
bearing
on
the
question.
now,
i
would
point
out
that
both
things
were
fully
developed
later
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant.
the
united
states
attorney
answered
solely
on
the
question
of
law,
of
the
powers
that
the
judge
had.
at
that
point
on
page
25,
the
court
said,
“well,
i
think
that's
as
far
as
we
can
go
without
the
defendants,”
and
ordered
a
short
recess
to
the
defendants
who
were
there.
their
first
aggravating
in
circumstance,
i
say,
that
announced
to
a
fundamental
defect
was
the
conduct
of
that
short
proceeding
in
the
absence
of
the
defendants.
first
of
all,
and
if
the
answers
are
many,
many
arguments
on
questions
of
law,
of
course,
take
place
outside
the
hearing
of
the
defendant
at
the
bar,
in
chambers
many
of
the
times,
and
that
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
a
defendant
is
required
to
be
present
for
it.
he
is
required
to
be
present
for
all
the
legally
operative
events
in
the
trial:
the
sentencing,
the
admission
of
evidence,
the
verdict
and
those
steps
in
the
proceeding.
secondly,
this
was
initiated
by
mr.
friedman
who
when
to
use
the
opportunity
to
make
what
he
thought
was
an
argument
helpful
to
the
defendants
and
how
because
the
government
did
not
object
to
mr.
friedman
utilizing
that
opportunity
he
should
now
--
the
sentence
would
be
vacated.
i
don't
really
understand.
in
any
event,
even
assuming
that
it
was
error,
there's
no
possible
suggestion
that
it
was
a
basic
error
that
it
affected
the
outcome
of
the
proceedings
in
any
way.
the
second
circumstance
that
they
offer
as
an
aggravation
is
the
assertion
that
the
judge
was
acting
under
misapprehension
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
and
that
the
defendants,
have
they
spoken,
might
have
removed
the
misapprehension.
the
facts
of
the
crime
don't
appear
in
this
record.
from
the
record
of
the
earlier
proceedings,
it
appears
that
mr.
donovan
boarded
a
post
office
truck
when
it
was
stopped
at
the
stoplight
wearing
a
post
office
uniform
that
he
had
acquired
and
pointed
a
gun
at
the
driver.
now
he
boarded,
it
appears
that
he
boarded
the
post
office
truck
on
a
signal
from
mr.
andrews,
the
other
petitioner
here
who
was
standing
nearby
and
the
plan
was
to
--
for
mr.
donovan
to
force
the
driver
to
turn
into
an
alley
where
they
would
then
remove
the
currency
from
the
truck.
now,
mr.
cohen's
part
in
the
transaction,
he
was
the
third
defendant
originally
and
he's
not
a
petitioner
here,
was
that
he
was
a
post
office
employee
who
informed
them
which
truck
would
have
the
money
and
that
was
his
only
role.
he
did
not
participate
in
the
actual
events.
now,
at
the
sentencing
proceeding
on
page
25,
united
states
attorney
very
briefly
summed
up
what
had
transpired.
he
recalled
the
crime
to
the
judge
and
said
that
the
--
there
was
a
holdup
--
the
actual
attempted
holdup
with
the
revolver
was
performed
by
donovan.
the
person
who
planned
and
helped
execute
the
holdup
was
the
defendant
andrews
and
mr.
cohen's
part
was
that
he
was
the
post
office
employee
who
informed
them.
that
was
all
that
was
said
about
the
crime
upon
by
any
counsel
prior
to
the
sentencing.
the
--
judge
walsh,
after
hearing
the
arguments
presented
by
counsel
and
why
a
lesser
sentence
--
why
it
should
suspend
the
mandatory
sentence
then
rules
on
pages
30
and
31
said
that
he
has
given
a
great
deal
of
thought
to
this
since
the
court
of
appeals
has
reversely
remanded
it
for
reconsideration
and
says,
i
have
concluded
that
i
cannot,
in
connection
with
donovan
or
andrews
do
that,
in
other
words,
the
two
men
who
perpetrated
the
holdup
of
the
truck.
now
petitioners
say
that
he's
confused
there
and
more
clearly
later
on
in
thinking
that
andrews
actually
also
got
on
the
truck
with
donovan
rather
than
was
simply
at
the
scene
signaling
donovan.
now
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
clear
that
all
the
judge
means
is
to
distinguish
cohen
who
didn't
participate
at
all
from
the
other
two
who
carried
it
out.
these
are
the
two
men
who
perpetrated
the
holdup
and
he
explained
that
i
do
not
think
that
i
can
suspend
sentence
and
permit
you
to
serve
only
the
sentence
that
a
person
has
to
serve
who
was
conspired,
but
did
not
carry
out
the
crime.
and
as
--
he
says,
as
to
mr.
cohen,
he's
unhappy
with
the
choice
he
has
but
he
would
take
the
chance
and
says,
“frankly,
if
you
had
been
with
the
other
two
on
the
truck,
i
would
not
suspend
your
sentence.”
and
it's
that
phrase
“on
the
truck”
that
the
petitioners
primarily
rely
upon
to
show
a
misapprehension
by
the
judge
i.e.
that
he
thought
that
andrews
was
physically
on
the
truck
itself
rather
than
he
should
be
at
the
scene
of
the
crime.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
at
page
31
of
the
record.
it
starts
at
page
30
and
continues
to
page
31.
i
might
also
say,
i
think
there's
no
possible
case
that
made
out
that
he
did
in
fact
act
under
the
misapprehension
and
i
would
add
that
this
question
was
raised
before
in
another
application
for
relief
under
2255,
not
based
on
the
right
of
allocution
but
on
the
fact
of
misapprehension
and
that
was
denied
at
170
that
this
was
decided
in
our
brief
at
page
1,
170
f.
supp.
380
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
this
court
denied
certiorari
raising
the
factual
question
whether
the
judge
was
under
misapprehension.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
the
step
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
step
one
takes
in
saying
that
it
is
a
part
of
the
constitutional
guarantees
would,
i
suppose
equally
control
the
availability
of
collateral
remedies
but
that's
a
big
step.
to
take
that
step,
you
say
that
it's
fundamentally
unfair
unless
he's
given
that
right
and
we
agree
that
if
the
proceedings
were
fundamentally
unfair,
you
can
get
relief
under
2255.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
would
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
historical
origins
are
somewhat
cloudy.
i
think
as
justice
frankfurter
noted
that
at
one
time,
the
defendant
was
not
allowed
to
take
the
stand
and
at
that
time,
his
right
to
speak
was
really
his
right
to
make
an
unsworn
statement
in
the
nature
of
giving
testimony
and
it
was
i
then
say
it's
been
a
very
important
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
but
once
he
was
given
the
right
to
take
the
stand
and
all
of
the
other
paraphernalia
providing
greater
and
greater
protection,
the
right
to
counsel,
of
the
assured
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel,
it
seems
to
me
we
now
have
to
appraise
the
importance
of
the
right
to
speak
in
terms
of
its
present
day
context.
and
in
this
case
and
i
think
in
most
cases
under
the
federal
rule
--
federal
system
in
which
the
defendant
is
automatically
entitled
to
counsel
or
at
least
in
cases
where
he
in
fact
is
represented
by
counsel
and
counsel
not
--
aren't
simply
listed,
but
participate
actively
and
do
address
themselves
to
the
question
of
sentencing.
and
as
here,
make
a
full
presentation
of
his
background
of
all
of
the
factors
that
normally
would
be
called
upon
to
invoke
the
discretion
of
the
court,
the
concern
of
his
family,
the
fact
that
he
is
now
contrived
and
proposes
to
reform,
all
of
these
were
developed
at
length
by
counsel.
and
certainly
the
most
one
i
think
could
say
is
that,
if
the
defendant
asks
to
speak
and
were
specifically
denied
the
right,
that
perhaps
would
be
a
more
serious
error,
but
here,
we're
only
talking
about
the
failure
of
the
judge
specifically
to
address
to
the
defendant
ignoring
his
counsel
as
his
representative
a
specific
question,
“do
you
have
anything
to
say?”
and
i
find
it
hard
to
think
that
that
is
a
constitutional
requirement.
this
counsel
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
was
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
want
to
prove
it
but
he
has
the
right.
he
was
specific.
he
offered
--
he
wasn't
specifically
extending
an
invitation.
he
was
never
denied
the
right
in
the
sense
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
not
that
he
is
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
not
if
he
is
actually
in
fact
represented
by
counsel,
i
don't
think
it
is
a
formal
distinction.
by
and
large,
most
of
your
rights,
if
you're
represented
by
counsel,
are
left
for
vindication
by
the
diligence
of
counsel
and
we
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
these
defendants
wanted
to
speak
and
i
take
it
myself,
do
defendants
in
fact
speak.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
think
that
may
well
be
the
case.
and
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
we're
not
in
any
way
disagreeing
with
green.
i
think
you're
quite
right
that
these
are
very
simple
things
to
do
and
certainly
judges
ought
to
do
it,
but
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
makes
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
it
makes
a
difference
with
that
which
is
a
reversible
error
but
we're
here
dealing
with
the
problem
within
seven
years
later.
we
should
now
set
aside
what
we've
done.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
failure
to
raise
this
question
is
he
was
first
sentenced
in
december
31,
1954.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
to
his
resentencing
in
1957.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
but
those
delays
have
nothing
to
do
with
raising
of
this
issue.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
no,
no,
no.
he
could
have
raised
this
at
the
first
trial
and
on
appeal
from
the
first
sentencing
as
one
of
his
assignments
of
error
in
the
first
sentencing.
had
he
--
had
he
raised
it,
i'm
sure
that
on
the
resentencing,
he
would
have
specifically
been
asked
the
question.
he
could
have
raised
it
on
appeal.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
because
it
is
such
a
simple
thing
to
do
that
i
take
this
is
not
done
only
through
oversight
and
i
don't
believe
that
any
judge
consciously
decides
so
i'm
not
going
to
ask
him
to
speak
and
certainly,
i
don't
think
judge
walsh
did
that.
he
heard
the
lawyers
get
up
and
give
a
full
statement
for
them
and
assumed
that
was
all
that
was
to
be
presented
in
their
behalf
and
not
unreasonable
assumption.
now
i
agree
that
he
ought
not
make
the
assumption.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
he
must
inquire.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i'm
not
certain
that
--
well,
i
agree
with
the
interpretation
placed
on
the
rule.
it
isn't
that
clear
that
--
in
saying
that
he
shall
afford
an
opportunity
necessarily
means
that
despite
the
presence
of
counsel,
the
judge
shall
himself
specifically
inquire.
i
don't
think
this
necessarily
means
the
same
thing.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
know,
i
agree
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
agree
that
that
is
the
sound
of
interpretation.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
green
and
van
hook
specifically
decided
that.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
we
don't
challenge
that.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
no,
no.
we
do
not.
we
do
not
and
i
think
it
is
error
as
i
conceded,
but
the
problem
on
collateral
attack
is
a
quite
different
one
as
it
is
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
there
are
many
trial
errors
that
occur
during
the
course
of
a
trial
for
which
there
is
no
remedy
other
than
appeal,
errors
that
in
their
impact
upon
the
defendant
may
have
a
much
more
important
and
significant
effect
it
seems
to
me
than
say
you're
here
to
ask
the
defendant
to
speak.
now,
in
those
cases,
the
error
is
committed.
we
don't
automatically
say
that
you
can
review
it
anytime
even
after
the
judgment
has
otherwise
become
final
and
to
set
up
an
automatic
rule
for
the
failure
in
this
one
instance,
seems
to
me,
would
simply
create
an
anomaly.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
--
i
don't
deny
that
the
consequences
of
the
proceeding,
namely
the
sentence
to
be
imposed
are
a
very
serious
matter.
what
i
do
deny
is
if
there's
any
reason
to
suppose
that
this
defect
had
a
material
impact
on
the
outcome
of
that
proceeding
in
the
sense
that
we
require
for
collateral
proceedings.
of
course,
every
error
conceivably
can
affect
the
outcome.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
don't
say
that.
i
think
every
error
who
affects
the
outcome,
but
traditionally
--
after
all,
our
system
is
basically
structured
on
the
notion
that
a
thing
once
disposed
of
is
disposed
of
and
we
don't
continually
retry
every
error
granted.
we
have
made
many
inroads
on
that
principle
in
criminal
cases.
thus
far,
we
have
limited
that
to
a
very
constitutional
rights,
jurisdictional
defects;
very
basic
fundamental
things
going
to
the
basic
fairness
of
the
proceeding.
here,
what
we
have
it
seems
to
me,
is
simply
a
violation
of
a
specific
procedural
rule
entirely
different
kind
of
thing.
i
think
than
any
other
case
is
allowed
a
collateral
remedy
for
it.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
right,
i'm
directing
myself
to
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
2255.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
rule
31,
as
you
know,
this
is
interpreted
in
hill,
it
provides
that
a
judge
may
correct
an
illegal
sentence
at
any
time.
in
hill,
the
court
said
that
an
illegal
sentence
is
one
that
has
an
illegality
in
its
terms
or
duration.
the
sentence
itself
is
a
wrong
sentence
to
impose.
it
does
not
mean
one
that
is
imposed
in
a
procedure
in
the
proceeding
where
there
are
procedural
errors.
it's
a
difference
between
a
proper
sentence
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
would
--
that
really
i
think
has
a
bearing
only
on
the
appealability
question.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
i
think
we
all
agree
--
we
all
agree
that
the
relief
he
is
entitled
to
the
labels
don't
make
any
difference.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
at
the
moment
i'm
trying
to
confine
myself
to
the
merits
because
the
government
has
to
prevail
on
the
merits
as
well
as
on
the
appealability.
it
maybe
sufficient
for
the
petitioners
to
prevail
on
appealability
but
it's
not
sufficient
for
us.
even
if
it's
appealable,
i
have
to
satisfy
you
that
the
decision
below
was
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
on
the
merits
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
yes
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
it
does.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
--
donovan's
petition
--
donovan's
motion
was
we
agree
labeled
and
styled
as
one
under
rule
35.
all
the
judge
did
was
grant
it.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
perfectly
willing
--
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
assume
that
he
thought
that
it
lay
under
rule
35
and
was
looking
to
that
when
he
signed
the
order.
as
to
donovan
--
as
to
andrews,
i
disagree
but
i
think
on
the
main
question
that
that
isn't
going
to
be
terminated.
now
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
i
--
i
don't
say
that.
when
i
--
on
the
appealability
question
at
that
point,
i
don't
think
that
the
labels,
what
the
judge
went
hat
he
was
wearing,
it's
useful
to
speak
up
two
rules
authorizing
action
as
jurisdictional
notions.
i
don't
think
that
makes
the
difference.
i
think
what
makes
the
difference
is
the
nature
of
the
relief
requested
and
granted.
the
character
of
the
action
determines
the
government's
right
to
appeal
and
not
whether
it
styled
under
section
2255
or
under
rule
35,
and
i
will
show
that
the
character
of
the
proceeding
and
the
nature
of
relief
granted
is
specifically
that
provided
for
in
2255
and
that
our
right
of
appeal
under
2255
is
equally
applicable
to
donovan's
case.
the
--
now,
on
the
merits
on
rule
35,
i
don't
expect
to
convince
those
who
disagreed
in
hill
that
the
decision
was
right.
i
do
hope
to
persuade
you
that
it
was
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
what
is
after
all
a
rule
of
this
court
and
that
there
is
no
occasion
to
overrule
it.
it's
been
decided
and
if
the
rule
is
to
be
changed
as
i
think
the
dissent
pointed
out
in
hill,
they
can
be
changed
quite
simply
by
this
court.
and
certainly,
if
there's
any
substance
to
the
notion
of
repose
and
stare
decisis,
it
ought
to
apply
to
such
a
question.
at
least
if
it
is
one
of
two
reasonable
interpretations
and
i
suggest
plainly
that
it
is
at
least
that.
first,
on
the
language,
i
think
illegal
sentence
does
illegal
modify
sentence
and
it
does
suggest
that
the
illegality
is
in
the
sentence
and
not
in
the
proceeding
by
which
it
was
imposed.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
not
sure
how
independent
that
is.
the
court
--
the
cases
by
and
large
in
dealing
with
collateral
ancillary
proceedings
has
merged
the
notion
of
independence
and
the
finality.
if
it
so
independent
of
the
main
course
of
the
action
then
the
action
is
final.
and
if
it
is
not
deemed,
that
independent
is
not
final.
i'm
not
entirely
sure
that
the
court
has
treated
a
separate
question.
i
do
propose
a
deal
without
those
questions.
let
me
turn
then
to
the
question
of
appealability.
and
first,
because
it
is
also
challenged
as
justice
harlan
notes,
even
on
the
assumption
that
this
is
a
2255
proceeding,
i
would
like
to
first
establish
our
right
to
appeal
assuming
this
is
a
2255
proceeding
and
then
deal
with
the
question
whether
the
fact
that
donovan's
motion
was
labeled
under
rule
35
should
change
the
result.
2255
was
adopted
as
part
of
1948
revision
of
judicial
code
and
its
history
was
canvassed
by
this
court
in
the
hayman
case
in
342
u.s.
now
i
think
it
is
now
established
and
there's
no
issue
about
it
that
basically
it
is
a
substitute
in
the
sentencing
court
for
the
remedy
of
previously
available
by
habeas
corpus.
the
main
problem
it
was
directed
towards
solving
was
that
habeas
corpus
lay
only
in
the
place
of
detention.
and
the
court
where
the
prisoner
was
detained
didn't
have
the
records,
didn't
know
anything
about
the
case.
all
the
witnesses,
if
the
witnesses
were
necessary,
were
probably
back
in
the
jurisdiction
where
he
was
tried
and
sentenced,
and
in
addition,
they
concentrated
by
having
burden
of
post
collateral
proceedings
in
the
few
districts
where
the
federal
prisons
happen
to
be
located.
now
the
purpose
of
2255
was
to
shift
the
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
as
it
were
into
the
sentencing
court.
now
in
doing
that
and
putting
it
back
into
the
sentencing
court,
there
was,
i
acknowledge,
a
blurring
of
the
separation
of
a
collateral
proceeding
and
the
criminal
proceeding.
when
they're
in
different
courts,
the
separation
is
perfectly
clear.
the
habeas
corpus
court
could
simply
order
the
release
because
the
detention
was
illegal
and
the
sentencing
court
would
then
have
to
take
some
action
to
correct
the
defect
and
make
a
legal
order
sentencing
it.
now
when
you
put
the
two
together
and
you
take
the
collateral
remedy
and
put
it
into
the
sentencing
court,
it's
inevitable
i
think
the
way
statutes
are
written,
there
are
some
blurring
of
the
character
and
the
separation
of
the
two
proceedings
and
i
think
that's
evident
from
the
wording
of
2255.
that
appears
at
the
petitioners
brief
at
page
48.
now,
let
me
say
that
this
court
has
held
and
it's
now,
i
think,
firmly
established,
2255
is
an
independent
civil
proceeding
and
for
example
that
the
civil
--
the
time
limit
is
applicable
to
civil
cases,
government
appeals
and
certiorari
that
was
held
in
the
hayman
case
and
i
think
in
the
heflin
case,
but
there
are
difficulties
and
rationalizing
that
treatment
in
terms
of
the
language.
now,
the
first
paragraph,
i'm
reading
on
page
48,
starts
out
providing
that
a
prisoner
in
custody
under
the
sentence
of
a
federal
court,
claiming
the
right
to
be
released
may
on
stated
grounds
move
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
claiming
the
right
to
be
released.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
to
be
released.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
may
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
oh
yes.
well,
let
me
say
that
what
the
suggestion
at
2255
by
its
terms
would
not
apply
to
this
case
which
i
think
--
a
news
just
in
or
--
i
don't
remember
that
in
the
brief
because
he
was
not
claiming
the
right
to
be
released,
only
the
right
to
be
resentenced.
i
think
it
is
not
the
case.
the
prisoner
is
objecting
to
the
legality
of
the
sentence
under
which
he
is
held
and
all
he
wants
is
to
have
that
vacated
and
he'd
be
quite
happy
to
go
free.
he
is
not
--
he
is
not
claiming
the
right
to
be
resentenced.
he
is
claiming
that
the
present
sentence
is
illegal
and
ought
to
be
struck.
now,
he
foresees
of
course
that
if
that
is
done,
the
government
would
then
have
the
right
to
have
him
resentenced
and
to
correct
the
defect.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
he
asked
--
in
the
pleading,
he
asked
to
be
--
to
have
it
vacated
and
be
resentenced.
that
is
only
an
anticipation
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
no,
not
under
35,
i'm
just
speaking
of
the
relief
they
ask
for.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
he
asked
for
the
same
relief.
i
don't
know
that
he
asked
--
to
be
--
whether
he
focused
on
rule
35
for
the
same
procedure
that
strikes
in
a
rather
sophisticated
concept
to
read
into
his
request.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
now,
they
listed
andrews'
case
as
a
2255
motion
i
believe.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
it
is
correct
that
it
is
docketed
in
the
criminal
case.
actually,
i'm
not
sure
that
is
a
wrong
interpretation
of
2255
and
i
will
come
to
that.
whether
it
was
treated
as
rule
35
or
2255,
i
believe
mr.
prettyman
can
confirm
this
that
in
andrews'
case,
it
was
entered
as
a
rule
--
as
a
section
2255
application.
now
under
--
regardless
of
the
docket
that
was
entered
under,
it
was
listed
as
the
rule
--
as
a
section
2255
application.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
but
i'm
now
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
was
in
the
--
it
was
entered
in
the
original
case
under
the
criminal
docket
number.
i'm
not
denying
that.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
one
of
the
ambiguities
that
the
--
the
way
it
is
in
fact
has
treated,
there
seems
to
be
a
discrepancy
depending
upon
each
district
court
clerk
where
they
list
2255
under
a
new
docket
number
as
a
civil
proceeding
or
simply
as
a
motion
in
the
criminal
case.
and
that
ambiguity,
i
think,
is
evident
in
the
language
of
2255.
now
it
starts
out,
it
says
that
a
prisoner
in
custody
claiming
the
right
to
be
released
may,
on
stated
grounds,
move
the
court
which
imposed
the
sentence
to
vacate,
set
aside
or
correct
sentence.
now,
the
grounds
stated
are
those
for
which
habeas
corpus
generally
was
available.
and
to
that
extent,
the
parallel
is
there.
in
addition,
he
may
move
to
have
the
sentence
vacated,
set
aside
or
corrected.
now
apart
from
the
word
correct
which
i
think
have
a
special
meaning
in
that
context,
the
release
--
the
relief
he
may
ask
for
is
the
same
sought
in
habeas
corpus
i.e.
to
have
the
sentence
vacated
or
set
aside.
however,
note
that
it
is
to
be
brought
on
by
a
motion
in
the
sentencing
court
and
there
is
at
least
an
implication
as
to
be
by
a
motion
in
the
criminal
case,
the
sentencing
court
and
the
criminal
case
and
that
implication
is
added
to
by
the
next
paragraph
which
says
that
unless
the
files
and
record
of
the
case
conclusively
show
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
relief
to
have
a
hearing.
and
that
refers
to
the
files
and
records
of
the
case
presumably
only
one
case
of
the
criminal
case.
now,
it
is
finally
--
the
implication
is
finally
extended
at
the
end
of
paragraph
3
which
directs
the
court,
tell
the
court
what
it's
suppose
to
do.
and
it
says
that
if
the
court
finds
the
motion
to
be
well
founded,
the
court
shall
vacate
and
set
the
judgment
aside
and
--
and
it
goes
on,
and
shall
discharge
the
prisoner
or
resentence
him,
or
grant
a
new
trial,
or
correct
the
sentence
as
it
may
appear
appropriate.
that
is
to
say
under
the
--
literally
under
2255,
the
judge
doesn't
stop.
he
was
simply
vacating
what
was
done
that
was
wrong.
he's
told
to
go
ahead
and
correct
it.
now,
this
is
a
merging
of
the
collateral
relief
and
the
corrective
proceeding,
the
merging
of
the
habeas
corpus
and
the
main
criminal
case.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
because
--
because
the
collateral
proceeding
was
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no
--
oh
no,
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
what
i'm
suggesting
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
doesn't
add
substantively
because
under
habeas
corpus,
the
habeas
corpus
court
would
order
and
say
that
this
sentence
is
invalid
and
vacated
and
direct
the
prisoner
to
be
relieved
--
released
subject
to
interim
detention,
pending
action
by
the
sentencing
court
then
the
holding
for
resentencing
--
and
the
sentencing
court
would
then
resentence
him,
but
it
required
the
cooperation
of
two
courts.
but
when
you
put
the
collateral
proceeding
together,
put
it
back
into
the
sentencing
court
so
that
you
don't
have
that
necessary
separation.
it's
quite
understandable
that
the
distinctness
becomes
blurred
and
it
is
blurred
there.
the
collateral
proceeding
stops
when
he
is
ordered
to
be
discharged
when
the
sentence
--
the
existing
sentence
is
set
aside
or
vacated,
but
then
the
court
is
told
to
go
on
with
the
powers
it
has
as
the
sentencing
court
to
resentence
the
defendant.
at
that
point,
the
nature
of
this
proceeding
is
i
agree,
a
very
ambiguous
and
hybrid
thing.
i
think
the
answer
is
found
in
the
provision
in
the
next
--
the
last
paragraph,
the
governing
appeals.
that
provides
that
an
appeal
maybe
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
order
entered
on
the
motion
as
from
a
final
judgment
on
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
now
basically,
what
that
i
think
means
is
despite
the
fact
that
we
have
put
the
collateral
proceedings
into
the
sentencing
court
and
have
not
carefully
maintained
the
demarcation
here;
nevertheless,
it
is
still
to
be
treated
as
a
distinct
proceeding
as
in
habeas
corpus.
now
certainly,
certainly
this
language
does
create
a
right
to
appeal.
it
says,
you
may
appeal
from
the
order
entered
on
the
motion
and
we
don't
need
to
rely
upon
the
general
appellate
appeal
provisions
nor
is
it
stated
here
requirement
of
finality.
so
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
that
is
the
basic
ambiguity.
the
motion
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
let
me
create
an
ambiguity.
the
first
paragraph
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
hope
i
can
create
it
to
resolve
it.
now,
the
first
paragraph
describes
the
motion
where
he
may
move
the
court
to
vacate,
set
aside,
or
correct
the
sentence.
now
correct
the
sentence
i
think
has
to
deal
with
cases
when
all
you
do
is
simply
loft
off
the
excess.
you
don't
resentence.
you
simply
make
a
correction,
but
it
does
not
as
the
third
paragraph
does
at
that
point
go
on
to
say
resentence
or
order
a
new
trial
or
so
forth.
so
the
motion
simply
asks
that
it
would
be
vacated
and
set
aside.
now,
it
could
be
that
the
order
entered
on
the
motion
as
used
in
the
appeal
provision
refers
that
to
order
granting
the
relief
asked
for
in
the
motion
authorized
to
be
filed.
now,
in
fact
the
judge
is
told
upon
granting
such
relief
to
go
on.
he
is
told
not
to
stop,
but
to
go
on
and
exercise
its
powers
as
the
sentencing
court
to
the
corrective
steps.
now,
i
say
that
most
consistently
with
the
traditions
of
appeals
in
criminal
cases,
the
proper
way
to
construe
this
is
to
read
it
as
giving
us
an
appeal
from
the
action
on
the
motion
asking
to
have
it
vacated
and
set
aside,
i.e.
the
order
vacating
the
sentence.
you
could,
i
agree,
read
it
as
given
this
right
to
appeal
from
the
further
order
resentencing
it.
now,
certainly,
we
can't
challenge
the
discretion
exercise
in
the
resentencing.
and
we'd
be
challenging
on
--
if
that
appeal
would
be
the
vacation
of
the
prior
sentence.
and
i
don't
think
it's
not
consistent
with
the
way
generally
we
have
treated
appeals
from
collateral
attacks.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
court
in
heflin
and
--
no,
i
guess
it's
really
dictum
held
that
2255
applies
only
if
he
is
presently
incarcerated
under
the
sentence
he
is
attacking.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
now
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
--
i
think
all
of
those
considerations
equally
go
to
the
errors
prior
to
conviction,
an
illegal
conviction
equally
once
you
reach
the
result
in
heflin.
let
me
say
that
the
system
of
remedies
in
criminal
cases
is
not
a
neat
pattern
and
i
think
the
result
in
heflin
does
increase
the
difficulties
of
trying
to
make
a
rational
system
of
post-conviction
remedies.
it
was
only
dictum
and
i
suggest
that
it
is
to
be
reconsidered
as
that
is
probably
the
more
appropriate
thing
to
reconsider.
i
agree
that
on
the
law,
on
the
development
from
habeas
corpus,
it
seems
a
sound
interpretation
of
the
statute.
it
doesn't
--
it
leaves
a
gap
in
the
system
of
post-conviction
remedies
and
the
government
is
cognizable
of
that
gap,
but
that
gap,
we're
not
going
to
solve
by
the
attempted
use
of
rule
35
here
because
that
gap
is
equally
present
and
much
more
glaring
in
the
case
of
the
defendant
who
was,
he
claims
unconstitutionally
convicted
and
no
one
suggest
that
he
has
a
remedy
under
rule
35
for
that.
and
the
problem
--
the
problem
is
whether
we
should
give
preferred
status
to
errors
in
the
sentencing
procedure
as
compared
to
errors
in
the
trial
and
i
see
no
reason
why
a
rational
system
would
do
that,
but
the
--
we
don't
deny
that
rule
35
applies
to
the
correction
of
sentences
which
are
on
their
face
illegal,
a
sentence
in
excess
for
such
maximum
for
that
sort
of
correction
as
it
was
done
in
the
heflin
case.
to
end
up
on
rule
2255,
the
interpretation
i
suggested,
i
think
is
given
further
support
by
the
express
analogy
to
habeas
corpus,
the
appeal
from
the
order
as
from
the
final
judgment
and
application
of
habeas
corpus.
the
final
judgment
of
habeas
corpus
would
be
simply
the
release,
the
vacation
of
the
erroneous
sentence
and
not
the
entry
of
the
new
sentence.
and
it
seems
to
me
to
--
in
the
light
of
its
history,
its
development
from
habeas
corpus
and
the
express
relation
back
to
habeas
corpus
in
the
statute,
but
that
is
the
appropriate
time.
certainly,
that
is
the
time
that
the
independent
civil
proceeding
termi
--
necessarily
terminates
because
this
resentencing
is
necessarily
back
in
the
criminal
case.
and
if
as
the
court
has
held,
this
is
an
independent
civil
proceeding,
it's
at
that
point
that
it
stops.
and
we
do
have
a
right
of
appeal.
the
statute
gives
us
the
right
of
appeal
and
it
doesn't
specifically
impose
its
own
finality
requirement.
we're
not
appealing
under
1291
and
so
the
finality
requirement
there
prescribed
is
not
in
terms
applicable
here.
but
the
finality
question
has
been
identified
in
the
cases
with
the
separateness
if
it
is
an
independent
civil
proceeding
then
the
end
of
that
proceeding
is
the
final
order
--
it
is
the
final
decision
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
the
end
of
the
independent
civil
proceeding,
if
it
is
an
independent
civil
proceeding,
is
necessarily
the
vacation
of
the
existing
sentence.
the
resentencing
cannot
be
conceived
out
as
a
part
of
an
independent
civil
proceeding.
the
resentencing
have
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
--
well,
it's
that
difficult
well
i've
been
trying
to
explain.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
haven't
tried
to
pay
something
to
it
i
think.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i'm
really
is
trying
to
make
sense
out
of
this.
it
is
not
--
frankly,
it
was
not
drafted
having
in
mind
the
separation
of
functions.
the
draftsman
as
when
you
put
it
back
on
the
sentencing
court,
and
back
in
the
sentencing
court,
you
just
go
ahead
and
tell
them
what
to
do.
you
vacate
that
and
you
go
ahead
and
resentence.
there
isn't
the
necessary
bifurcation
of
the
process,
but
the
appeal
provision
insists
that
we
do
maintain
conceptually
a
division
between
the
two
halves
of
the
case
as
in
habeas
corpus.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
let
me
--
let
me
turn
to
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
rule
35.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
rule
35,
we
say
as
the
court
decided
in
hill,
does
not
apply
to
errors
in
the
proceedings
in
which
the
sentence
was
imposed.
it
goes
only
to
the
defects
in
the
sentence
itself
and
its
content
duration
or
term.
and
it
derives
not
only
on
its
face
but
from
historical
antecedents.
i
think
that
it
is
its
function.
the
advisory
committee
noted
that
simply
it
was
a
continuation
of
existing
law
and
what
the
existing
law
had
to
do
with
was
what
powers
the
court
had
after
the
exploration
of
the
term
to
modify
its
judgment
and
basically
that
was
limited
to
errors
appearing
on
the
face
of
the
common
law
record,
the
judgment
role
of
the
indictment,
the
verdict
of
the
plea
--
the
verdict,
the
judgment
and
sentence.
and
as
applied
to
the
sentencing
errors,
that
was
necessarily
limited
to
sentences
that
were
not
authorized
by
the
basic
statute.
they
never
exceeded
the
statute,
two
sentences
for
the
same
crime
and
that
sort
of
thing.
and
i
think
that
is
the
historical
origins
and
the
meaning
of
rule
35.
now
even
so
limited,
even
so
limited,
there's
an
overlap
between
it
and
2255
because
that
that
kind
of
defect
to
which
rule
35
does
speak
is
equally
covered
by
the
language
of
rule
2255.
now
this
is
not
that
case
because
our
case
lies
only
--
is
the
kind
of
defect
that
lies
only
under
2255
and
as
to
that
case,
we
say
simply
that
the
labels
do
not
control.
the
question
is
whether
he
asked
for
and
got
the
kind
of
relief
which
is
specifically
authorized
in
2255.
2255
doesn't
say,
“you
may
file
a
motion
labeled
section
2255.
it
is
simply
to
authorize
the
filing
of
a
motion.
you
don't
have
to
label
it
at
all.”
and
it
provides
that
action
on
that
kind
of
motion
is
appealable.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
how
it's
labeled
and
in
our
view,
the
appeal
authorization
in
rule
2255
reads
directly
on
the
motion
filed
whatever
it
was
labeled
or
one
looks
to
is
the
content
of
the
motion.
and
that
is
the
way
the
court
has
approached
rule
35
and
2255
when
questions
of
appeal
--
time
for
appeal
and
timeliness
of
certiorari
and
basically
you
look
to
whichever
one
by
its
terms
applies
and
the
label
that
the
petitioner,
the
defendant
used
or
that
the
court
used
doesn't
control
it.
and
we
are
simply
saying
the
same
thing.
otherwise,
the
wise
defendant
ought
--
simply
always
to
label
his
applications
rule
35.
and
most
district
courts
aren't
going
to
bother
to
change
the
label
if
they
think
he
is
entitled
to
it
because
this
court
has
told
them
to
ignore
the
labels.
and
so,
they
just
grant
the
motion
regardless
how
it's
labeled,
then
it
is
said
that
the
government
cannot
appeal
because
of
his
labeled
rule
35
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
labels
are
not
to
control,
they
are
not
to
control.
now,
i
would
address
myself
very
briefly
to
the
--
what
seems
to
me
the
much
more
troubling
question
where
relief
is
of
a
kind
which
both
authorized,
namely
the
excessive
sentence.
you
can
get
relief
under
rule
35
and
rule
20
--
and
section
2255
equally
applies.
now
i'm
not
certain
how
one
resolves
that
problem.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
sensible
result
certainly
it
shouldn't
turn
on
which
he
chooses
to
label
it.
i
don't
think
that
ought
to
be
discussed.
so
you
need
a
rule
that
in
the
overlapped
period,
one
or
the
other
governs
and
it
seems
to
me
that
to
work
out
a
consistent
body
of
post-conviction
remedies
in
section
2255
should
be
deemed
to
govern
anything
within
its
terms.
there's
no
reason
to
single
out
that
one
kind
of
defect
and
have
an
entirely
different
system.
that
question
isn't
involved
in
this
case
because
here,
if
we
arrive
on
the
merits
and
as
the
court
decided
in
the
hill
case
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
he
didn't
ask
merely.
he
has
to
have
his
sentence
vacated
i
believe.
and
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
of
course
--
well
that's
right.
there's
a
sense
of
for
[inaudible]
he
vacated
and
that
he'd
be
resentence
in
according
--
in
accordance
with
federal
rules
criminal
procedure.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
do
not
think
there
is
anyway
in
the
world
for
him
to
demand
that
he'd
be
resentenced.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
he
has
no
right
to
be
resentenced.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
he
has
a
right
only
not
legal
or
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
illegal
sentence.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
he
had
the
right
to
have
the
sentence
under
which
he
was
held
vacated
because
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
under
his
allegation,
it
was
an
illegal
sentence.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
under
rule
30
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
problem
with
rules
as
preceded
in
rule
35
is
the
nature
of
the
defect
he
is
alleging,
not
the
relief
he
is
requesting.
rule
35
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
it
would
be
properly
before
the
court
because
the
court
ought
not
to
dismiss
it
for
improper
labeling.
now,
if
the
court
--
let
us
suppose
he
stated
a
valid
claim
that
there
was
such
a
--
the
kind
of
defect
for
which
he
was
entitled
to
have
the
case
inside
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
and
labeled
it
rule
35.
if
the
court
dismissed
it
and
says
that
rule
35
doesn't
apply
to
that
kind
of
defect,
i'm
sure
that
we
have
--
we
would
immediately
--
it
would
immediately
be
reversed
or
mandamus
to
ignore
the
fact
that
it
was
labeled
rule
35
and
exercise
his
powers
given
by
rule
--
section
2255.
so
i'd
--
in
this
case
if
the
judge
acted
--
form
properly
and
all
of
the
clearest
forms,
he
would
have
said
this
does
not
lie
under
rule
35.
it
is
the
kind
of
defect
which
may
--
which
may
be
claimed
under
rule
--
under
section
2255.
however,
he
would
not
establish
a
--
the
kind
of
fundamental
unfairness
in
the
proceedings
to
warrant
relief.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
our
position
is
that
we
could.
well,
on
the
theory
that
2255
gives
us
a
right
to
appeal
from
the
order
entered
on
a
particular
kind
of
motion
and
the
motion
is
described
not
by
the
label
attached
to
it,
but
by
what
it
asked
for.
the
motion
is
described
as
one
which
claiming
these
defects
move
the
court
to
vacate
the
sentence
and
it
was
such
a
motion.
it
was
that
motion
described
in
section
2255
from
which
section
2255
gives
us
the
right
to
appeal.
and
it
does
not
necessary
that
it'd
be
labeled
2255
so
long
as
it's
that
kind
of
motion
we
can
appeal.
otherwise,
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
produce
a
game
in
labeling
and
i
think
that
is
what
this
court
has
avoided
in
this
treatment
of
indigents.
granted
this
in
this
instance,
if
you
like,
it
cuts
against
him,
but
still,
we
look
to
the
basic
nature
of
the
relief
he's
after
and
whether
the
court
has
power
to
grant
it
and
not
to
how
he
styles
the
application.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
if
we
--
is
that
from
which
we
appeal
and
it
must
appeal
within
time
of
that.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
now,
if
in
the
interim,
the
court
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
no,
that
would
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no.
we
could
still
appeal.
what
we
will
be
challenging
is
the
vacation.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
wouldn't
be
challenging
the
discretion
exercised
in
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no,
no.
i
wouldn't
read
2255
that
way.
i
think
it
goes
on
to
say
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
being
in
the
sentencing
court,
it
says
that
not
only
shall
you
vacate
the
sentence
as
you
did
in
habeas
corpus
but
since
you're
there,
go
ahead
and
correct
it.
but
at
that
point
it
shifts
gears
and
that
is
not
the
proceeding
it
seems
to
me,
that
is
not
--
the
farthest
action
taken
is
necessarily
in
the
criminal
case.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
don't
claim
the
right
to
appeal
from
the
resentencing.
i'm
saying
we
can
appeal
from
the
order
vacating.
now
if
it's
all
when
ordered
in
which
he
vacates
and
resentenced
the
same
order,
we
appeal
from
so
much
of
the
order
as
vacates
the
prior
sentence.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
now,
the
only
alternative
i
think
is
to
say
that
we
can
appeal
from
the
resentencing
and
that
just
seems
to
me
basically
contrary
to
the
tradition
of
criminal
appeal.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
not
if
it's
authorized.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
that
question,
i
think,
is
the
same
on
original
sentence
as
on
the
resentencing.
now
whatever
remedies
we
have,
we
have
occasionally
been
successful
in
mandamus
in
a
judge
who
on
the
original
sentence
did
not
impose
the
kind
of
sentence
required
by
the
statute.
now
whatever
powers
we
have
on
the
original
sentencing
against
erroneous
action
by
the
judge,
we
would
equally
have
on
the
resentencing,
but
it
would
in
all
respects
be
treated
from
the
vacation
on
is
treated
just
as
though
we're
back
in
the
original
case,
and
the
same
--
the
same
powers
of
review
that
we
have
then
would
equally
apply
[inaudible]
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
trying
to
avoid
saying
what
those
remedies
are.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
appeal
--
the
appeal
authorized
by
2255
is
one
that
goes
only
to
the
vacation
of
the
prior
order.
that
appeal
goes
on
[inaudible].
if
there'd
be
other
powers
which
we
would
have
quite
a
part
from
2255
to
an
appeal
that
the
sentence
originally
entered,
they
would
equally
apply
i
say
to
the
further
step
of
resentencing
after
2255
vacation.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
there
is
the
lane
case
which
i
think
is
not
in
brief,
basically
the
judge
granting
probation
when
he
was
not
authorized
to
grant
probation
under
the
statute
and
we
were
successful
mandamus
in
here.
we
tried
--
we
tried
to
appeal
--
we
first,
i
think,
filed
the
rule
35
motion
and
tried
to
appeal
from
that
and
let
me
tell
you
that
none
of
the
remedies
and
criminal
procedure
are
that
clear
cut.
i
can't
answer
your
question
confidently.
offhand,
i
don't
know
of
any
case
in
which
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
suppose
it
would
be
mooted.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
isn't
quite
the
same
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
yes.
that
is
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
the
possibility
of
mootness
and
it
is
not
the
same
as
finality.
the
finality
requirement
is
--
the
same
possibility
exists
in
habeas
corpus
for
example.
if
you
release
him
because
of
a
defect
in
the
trial,
he
maybe
retried
and
could
be
reconvicted
and
get
the
same
sentence
before
the
government
appeals
and
the
appeal
would
be
mooted,
but
it
is
not
because
the
--
there
was
not
a
final
termination
of
the
independent
civil
proceedings
in
the
habeas
corpus
court.
those
are
finally
disposed
off
and
it
seems
less
final
here
only
because
it
has
been
merged
into
one
court
and
the
same
court
that
conducts
the
independent
civil
proceeding
and
then
shifts
gears
and
acts
like
criminal
judge.
and
--
but
the
appeal
provision
i
think
it's
specifically
directs
to
preserve
the
independent
of
the
proceedings
nonetheless.
thank
you.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
thank
you
sir.
