justice

stewart
all
this
was
--
all
of
this
was
going
on
before
this
court's
decision
in
hill
against
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
had
van
hook
been
decided
at
per
curiam,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
on
direct
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
--
it
came
down
during
the
pendency
of
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
in
1951
in
this
record.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
following
--
it
was
the
following
january
or
february
that
hill
was
mentioned,
brought
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
open
or
over?
justice
potter
stewart
open.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
function
of
2255
as
the
function
of
habeas
corpus
is
to
secure
the
release
from
confinement
of
people
and
this
--
that
part
of
it
has
been
done.
they've
been
released
to
--
ordered
to
be
released
from
confinement
to
come
back
to
the
sentencing
court
to
be
resentenced.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
the
function
of
habeas
corpus
also.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
one
has
to
precede
the
other.
they
have
to
be
released
from
their
present
sentence
and
brought
back
to
the
sentencing
court
and
resentenced.
justice
potter
stewart
your
case
doesn't
depend
on
that
though,
does
it?
it
doesn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
depend
at
all
in
our
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
as
the
government
concedes.
justice
potter
stewart
the
government
concedes
that.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case
either.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
--
but
our
case
is
made
it
clear,
don't
they,
heflin
and
hill
itself
that
the
labels
don't
count
but
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
would
be
on
that
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
am
i
right
mr.
prettyman
in
understanding
that
under
count
2
of
these
indictments
that
the
court's
only
choice
is
to
impose
a
mandatory
25-year
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
or
to
impose
a
mandatory
25-year
sentence
and
then
put
the
man
on
probation
through
that
period.
justice
potter
stewart
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
that's
exactly
what
he
did
to
mr.
cohen.
in
the
first
--
and
the
first
reversal
was
on
the
basis
that
judge
walsh
didn't
think
he
had
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
discretion
to
allow
probation.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
no
wrong
for
anything
else
except
that
25
years
or
25
years
in
probation.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
had
been
decided
in
the
merger.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what's
been
decided
so
far
in
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
subject
to
your
--
right
of
course,
making
arguments
with
your
clients.
justice
potter
stewart
they
won't
--
they
want
to.
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding,
that's
the
point
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
right
here
in
the
language
of
2255.
justice
potter
stewart
you've
been
trying
to
evade,
that's
right,
but
it's
right
here
in
the
language
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
you
think
--
what
if
you
--
the
government
think
that
the
district
judge
who
has
committed
grossly
erroneous
error
in
resentencing
the
person,
you
can
appeal
from
that
you
say?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i'm
saying
that
your
position
--
this
is
not
authorized
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
assumption.
justice
potter
stewart
no
appeal
only
mandamus.
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
your
position?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
but
that's
my
question
because
you
say
your
appeal
is
only
for
the
vacation
and
not
from
anything
to
do
with
the
resentencing.
