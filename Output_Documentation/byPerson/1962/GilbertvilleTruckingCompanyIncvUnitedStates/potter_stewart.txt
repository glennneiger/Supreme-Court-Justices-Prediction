do
you
also
contend
that
even
assuming
that
violation
of
5
(4),
the
commission
gave
that
absolute
effect
in
denying
the
application
and
that
that
also
was
there.
justice
potter
stewart
has
found
to
be
the
product
of
the
now
(inaudible)
and
innocence
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
usefulness
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
now
mr.
starrett,
did
the
commission
do
what
you
claim
it
did
in
this
respect?
your
opponents
differ
with
you
throughout
as
a
matter
of
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
i
find
that
to.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
examiner
found
that
the
violation
was
unknowing
and
not
very
serious
to
paraphrase
this
remark.
but
what
if
the
commission
finds
out
--
found
as
to
that
subject
if
anything?
justice
potter
stewart
what
the
examiner's
findings
to
which
i
had
reference
appear
on
page
72
and
the
top
page
of
73
of
the
record
and
i
wondered
what,
if
anything,
the
commission
had
to
say
as
to
those
findings.
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
is
it,
page
23?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
nothing
--
there's
nothing
narrowly
wrong
in
trying
to
enlarge
your
company,
isn't
it?
there's
no
violation
of
anything,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
if
kenneth
nelson
had
not
been
related
at
all
to
the
owners
of
the
other
company
but
it's
just
been
john
smith
and
his
practices,
most
of
--
each
individual
practice,
as
i
understand
it,
is
perfectly
legal
and
proper
and
rather
common,
is
it
not?
i
mean
sharing
terminals
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
unusual.
that's
the
only
unusual.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
assume
that
instead
of
kenneth
nelson,
it
has
been
john
smith,
and
these
--
all
of
these
collections
of
activities
were
found
to
exist
by
the
commission.
what
would
be
accomplished
by
ordering
john
smith
to
divest
himself
with
the
ownership
of
that
company?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
the
key
to
the
thing
here
is
the
fact
that
he
is
a
brother,
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
there
a
finding
here
that
kenneth
was
an
agent
of
gilbertville?
justice
potter
stewart
--
rather
nelson's
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
district
court
didn't
find
that
he
was
an
affiliate,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
they
didn't
make
any
finding
under
6
or
5?
justice
potter
stewart
he
said,
it's
confirmed
by
those
