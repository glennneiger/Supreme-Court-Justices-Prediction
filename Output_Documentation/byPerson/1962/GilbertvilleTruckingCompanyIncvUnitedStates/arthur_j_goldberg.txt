what
were
the
principles
involved?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
starrett,
you
made
reference
to
page
23
of
the
record
where
you
referred
to
(inaudible)
is
it
your
view
that
the
commission
by
the
statute
(inaudible)
was
operating
in
a
more
stringent
approach
than
it
had
been
before
(inaudible)
assuming
that
(inaudible)
the
commission
learning
by
experience
that
the
public
interest
must
acquire
a
more
stringent
approach
than
they
have
here
before
these
companies?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
say
there
no
rational
basis
for
the
commission
to
take
these
companies,
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
kestenbaum,
gilbertville
is
a
very
small
company,
isn't
it?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
motor
carriers
is
still
today.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
can
you
tell
us
how
many
employees?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
absent
this
evidence
of
operation
to
(inaudible)
the
government
finds
that
the
merger
would
be
in
the
public
interest.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
violation,
therefore,
was
the
key
aspect
of
this
case
with
the
same
point
that
whether
there's
a
public
interest.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
commission
did
have,
however,
putting
aside
those
evidences
that
are
acquired
during
the
lawful
control.
it
gives
them
consideration
of
discretion,
i
gather,
the
merger
would
be
in
the
public
interest.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
doesn't
have
to
bring
back
where
the
commission
really
found
that
there
was
a
violation
of
law
that
ought
not
to
be
condoned?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
it
your
theory,
therefore,
that
this
finding
that
you
just
quoted
was
applied
here
by
the
commission
in
public
interest
and
regardless
of
the
violation
that
was
concerned?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
do
you
believe
that
is
this?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i'm
not
skeptical
but
something's
not
right
with
your
argument.
i
thought
you
said
earlier
that
even
--
first,
i
thought
you
said
that
the
violation
was
the
key
but
then
i've
heard
you
through
justice
harlan
that
that
might
be
a
hypothetical
case.
the
answer
for
this
that
there
were
other
elements
that
the
commission
passed
it
on
and
now
i
heard
you
say
in
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan
that
if
you
didn't
found
the
violation
you
would
have
to
go
back
in
the
commission.
now,
let
me
see
if
i
understand
what
your
point
is.
is
your
point
here
that
the
violation
in
this
record
has
given
a
hypothetical
case?
the
violation
is
the
key
here
if
it
were
a
violation
to
the
point
where
it
will
not
be
of
significant.
the
commission
had
not
passed
on
the
question
of
whether
the
merger
is
in
the
public
interest.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so
this
language
about
the
other
language
of
both
mergers
from
the
commission's
report
has
no
relevance.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
circumstances
other
than
violation
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
if
the
violations
were
out,
there
would
be
another
review
then,
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
there
should
be
another
review.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
are
there
any
complaint
filed
under
the
statutes
here
before
you
went
to
court
for
the
application
for
approval
of
the
merger?
