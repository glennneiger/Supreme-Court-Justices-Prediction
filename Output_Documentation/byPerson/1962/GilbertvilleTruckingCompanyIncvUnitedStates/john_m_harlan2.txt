are
you
saying
that
the
findings
of
the
commission
that
the
commission
did
make
are
not
supported
by
the
evidence
or
are
you
saying
that
the
findings
that
were
not
made
that
were
essential
typically
made
in
accordance
to
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
your
legal
point
that
sets
out
the
idea?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
security
question
upon
reading
the
evidence
as
though
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
this
phase.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
can
you
say
what
the
commission
would
have
done
on
a
hypothetical
instead
of
circumstances?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
pretty
freely
the
evidence
though.
the
question
that
is
put
to
you
as
to
what
--
what
would
have
been
the
situation
if
the
5
(4)
violation
have
been
--
not
in
the
picture
as
in
other
lawsuit.
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
position
is
that
given
the
findings
of
the
commission
that
there
has
been
a
5
(4)
violation,
the
commission
could
permissibly
conclude
that
it
was
not
in
the
public
interest
to
permit
a
merger
between
two
companies
that
had
been
under
an
illegal
relationship,
that's
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
all
there
is,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
why
--
why
the
commission
is
before
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
that
if
this
order
stands
and
two
or
three
years
go
by
and
the
--
is
there
any
reason
why
under
the
commission's
rules,
a
new
application
for
a
merger
could
be
filed
based
on
the
intervening
experience
and
the
public
interest
is
determined
in
the
light
of
that
experience
--
intervening
experience?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
assuming
that
a
period
has
gone
by
and
the
divestiture
of
the
urging
of
this
common
interest
has
been
accomplished
by
this
order
and
then
showing
an
application
is
made
for
a
merger.
could
the
commission
then
entertain
that
and
act
on
it.
