chief
justice
earl
warren
because
these
facts
are
rather
involved
as
well
as
the
statutes,
i
wonder
if
it
wouldn't
be
well
for
you,
if
it
wouldn't
disturb
your
argument
to
state
the
facts
of
the
case
to
us;
the
relationship
of
these
two
companies,
the
facts
upon
which
the
--
examine
what
the
commission
acted.
i
think
it
would
help
some
of
us
anyway
in
understanding
your
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
are
you
going
to
state
the
facts,
not
just
the
other

but
are
you
going
to
state
the
facts,
the
relationship
between
the
companies
and
how
they
were
constituted
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.

earl
warren
brothers

chief

finding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
did
find
specifically,
did
he,
that
there
was
a
violation
of
5
(4)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
a
violation,
he
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
his
finding
of
the
violation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
examiner
found
that
nelson
was
kenneth's
only
client
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
did
you
say
that
it
did
not
find
that
he
was
the
only
--?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
the
examiner.
i'm
looking
at
page
65
now,
at
the
end
of
the
first
full
paragraph.
as
i
read
it,
he
says
unequivocally,
nelson
was
kenneth's
only
client.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
starrett.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
starrett,
assuming
that
(inaudible)
that
there
was
a
violation
of
5
(4).
chief

not
required
but
is
permissible.

earl
warren

you
say
there
is
no

i

law
violation
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
assume

court
does
agree
that
there
is
a
violation.
what
kind
of
a
plea
is
this
one?
how
far
could
the
commission
go?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kestenbaum.

mr.
