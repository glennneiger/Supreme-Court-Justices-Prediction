i
right
--
justice

the
only
thing
we
have
is
whether

properly
have
dismissed
the
complaint
which
is
i
get
to
challenged
only
the
order
of
june
9,
1959
which
ordered
nelson
to
invest
himself
of
the
stock
interest
in
gilbertville?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
--
one
two
and
three
but
didn't
order
three,
didn't
order
three
merely
have
the
effect
of
reinstating
after
an
interim
stage
and
so
forth?
isn't
the
real
issue
doesn't
arise
from
the
order
of
divestiture
under
the
june
9,
1959
order
or
does
it?

now,
what
is
it
that
you
want
from

j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
divestiture,
it's
in
error
on
the
divestiture.
it's
in
error
on
the
merger?
justice

j.
brennan,
jr.

j.
brennan,
jr.

those

now,
all
of
these,
i
gather,
addressed
to
the
5
--
violation
of
5
(4),
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
you've
been
talking
about
so
far.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
agree
but
are
you
now
addressing
yourself
directly
to
the
finding
of
a
violation
of
5
(4)
on
your
argument
that
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
that
finding
of
violation,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
thought.
