mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
and
i
have
one
application
to
make
on
behalf
of
the
appellants
which
is
a
request
for
a
leave,
mr.
starrett
of
massachusetts
here
to
argue
pro
hac
vice.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
interstate
commerce
act,
section
5,
provides
the
commission
with
authority
to
approve
mergers
and
acquisitions
by
one
carrier
of
another
or
by
non-carriers
of
two
or
more
carriers.
the
statute
states
that
if
the
commission
determined
that
such
an
acquisition
will
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest,
it
shall
approve
such
carriers
--
such
mergers
subject
to
such
conditions
as
it
find
to
be
just
and
reasonable.
to
assure
that
the
commission
can
carry
out
their
statutory
purpose,
the
act
also
contains
within
it
--
section
5
contains
within
it
the
most
sweeping
prohibitions
of
any
mergers,
acquisitions
or
control
achieved
without
the
commission's
approval
and
that
is
what
this
case
involves.
the
commission
found
in
the
order
here
under
attack,
the
order
of
june
1959,
they
found
three
things.
it
decided
first
that
appellants
had
violated
section
5
(4)
of
the
act
by
the
unlawful
common
control
of
these
two
trucking
companies,
nelson
company
and
gilbertville
company.
it
found
--
second,
it
denied
the
application
of
the
appellants
to
merge
these
two
companies
and
third,
as
a
measure
of
relief
to
terminate
the
violation,
it
directed
the
appellants
to
divest
themselves
of
any
interest
which
they
had
in
the
acquired
company,
a
second
acquired
company,
the
gilbertville
company.
on
the
first
of
these
issues,
the
finding
of
unlawful
control,
all
the
tribunals
which
determine
this
question,
which
have
look
into
this
question,
which
have
canvassed
the
record
have
been
unanimous.
the
examiner
found
there
was
a
violation
of
5
(4),
the
division
4
found
it,
the
commission
found
it,
and
the
district
court
sustained
them
on
this
point.
mr.
starrett
has
discussed
some
of
the
practices
in
which
the
companies
engaged
and
he's
argued
that
in
many
situations,
there
can
be
legitimate
business
justifications
for
them.
the
issue
is
not
whether
any
one
of
these
specific
practices
is
illegal.
the
question
here
is
whether
taking
all
these
practices
together,
the
commission
could
find
that
the
relations
of
these
companies
were
not
those
of
independent
business
concerns,
doing
business
with
each
other
but
where
--
that
these
two
companies,
the
operations
of
these
two
companies
were
dictated
by
a
common
control
which
had
been
achieved
without
commission
approval.
i
don't
want
to
spend
too
much
time
on
these
factual
points.
the
--
we've
stated
in
some
detail
in
the
statement
of
facts
in
our
brief
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
some
of
the
highlights
of
the
relationships
of
these
companies.
after
kenneth
nelson
took
over
gilbertville
company
in
march
1953,
the
district
court
--
as
the
district
court
stated
there
was
a
convergence
of
the
operation
of
these
two
companies.
the
examiner
found
specifically
that
they
had
developed
into
what
was
in
effect
a
one
unified
organization.
some
of
the
highlights
of
this
are
the
fact
that
the
gilbertville
headquarters
were
moved
from
gilbertville
in
massachusetts
to
the
nelson
company
premises
in
rockville,
ellington,
connecticut.
the
two
companies
again
sharing
terminals,
they
shared
four
terminals
and
each
one
had
one
additional
terminal.
they
shared
the
same
telephone
number
in
seven
cities.
there
was
an
extensive
interchange
of
freight
which
developed
between
the
companies.
when
they
interchanged
freight,
nelson
company,
the
original
carrier
did
all
the
billing
and
they
had
the
--
they
shared
the
interchange
revenues
at
a
fixed
percentage
contrary
to
trade
practice.
there
was
extensive
leasing
of
equipment
from
the
initial
carrier
owned
by
the
family
to
the
second
carrier
from
nelson
company
to
gilbertville
company.
and
what
this
amounted
to
in
effect
was
the
shifting
of
equipment
from
the
service
under
the
nelson
company
authority
through
the
service
under
the
gilbertville
company
authority.
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
gilbertville
was
leasing
regularly
and
continuously
from
nelson
company
about
three
times
as
many
vehicles
as
it
had
at
the
time
kenneth
nelson
acquired
it.
the
one
remarkable
kind
of
arrangement
which
was
found
by
the
examiner
was
that
they
would
--
the
parties
would
arrange
to
change
an
interchange
of
freight
into
a
--
through
service
by
a
transaction
in
advance
which
at
the
interchange
point
took
effect
as
a
lease
of
a
vehicle
from
one
company
to
the
other
and
a
shift
of
employment
of
the
driver
from
one
company
to
the
other,
thus,
enabling
the
driver
to
go
right
through
and
being
transformed
in
effect
from
a
vehicle
of
one
company
to
a
vehicle
of
the
second
company.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
most
of
the
interchange,
according
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
chilberg,
the
principal
of
nelson
company,
took
place
--
most
of
these
interchanges
took
place
in
a
town
months
in
massachusetts
where
the
parties
do
not
even
have
a
terminal,
so
this
transaction
was
an
automatic
kind
of
thing
arranged
in
advance
for
the
common
interest
of
the
two
companies.
there
was
a
testimony
that
the
principals
of
each
company
acted
in
a
managerial
relationship
with
the
other
company.
the
inspectors
testified
that
when
they
visited
the
common
premises,
kenneth
nelson
was
not
in
the
gilbertville
office.
the
office
labeled
gilbertville.
he
was
downstairs
and
as
far
as
he
could
tell,
he
was
running
the
business,
running
both
businesses
and
directing
nelson
company
employees.
on
another
occasion,
a
shared
terminal
was
visited
and
a
principal
of
the
nelson
company,
clifford
nelson,
arranged
for
the
dispatching
of
a
gilbertville
truck
and
hired
a
driver
for
it.
there
were
several
occasions.
mr.
starrett
pointed
out
that
these
were
four
occasions
in
which
the
--
in
road
inspections
which
were
not
directed
to
these
companies
were
--
just
checks
of
the
vehicles
on
the
road.
the
icc
inspectors
discovered
that
a
vehicle
of
one
company
was
carrying
freight
under
the
papers,
the
shipping
papers
of
another
company
without
the
formality
of
transferring
papers,
the
issuance
of
a
new
delivery
receipt
or
anything
such
as
that.
these
items
were
not
presented
specifically
as
individual
violations.
they
were
presented
to
show
the
context,
to
show
that
the
companies
were
not
independent
business
concerns
doing
business
with
each
other.
they
were
companies
which
were
managed
in
a
common
interest.
and
the
commission
is
certainly
suppose
to
make
this
judgment
on
the
basis
of
these
facts
that
is
suppose
to
be
the
expert
familiar
with
the
trucking
industry
and
without
companies
do
business
with
one
another.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
they
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
gilbertville
certainly
was
very
small
company
which
began
operating
under
this
arrangement.
it
grew
so
that
in
time
of
the
hearing,
it
was
running
at
an
annual
gross
of
about
$425,
000
and
nelson
company
was
running
an
annual
gross
of
something
like
$900,000
at
that
time.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
sir?
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
nelson
owned
14
trucks,
61
tractors,
and
83
trailers.
i'm
citing
the
examiner's
report
at
page
43,
and
had
110
employees.
gilbertville,
this
is
at
page
44
of
the
record,
had
15
trucks,
12
tractors,
and
eight
trailers,
and
71
employees.
now,
these
were
not
very
great,
very
large
operations.
these
were
operations,
however,
since
they
involve
more
than
20
vehicles
were
subject
to
section
5
of
the
act.
one
of
the
things
found
by
the
examiner,
mr.
justice,
was
that
the
character
of
the
service
is
somewhat
changed
under
the
spirit
of
unlawful
control.
nelson,
as
counsel
pointed
out,
has
a
certificate
limited
to
the
textile
industry
and
it
is
found
that
as
the
textile
trade
shifted
out
of
new
england,
it
was
--
its
service
is
being
somewhat
impaired.
gilbertville
has
a
general
commodity
certificate.
when
acquired,
it
had
only
--
so
here's
the
record
44,
it
had
one
truck,
three
tractors
and
four
trailers,
and
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
the
examiner
found
that
the
merger
would
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest
then
i
think
had
not
been
in
violation,
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
merger
would
have
been
approved,
yes
sir.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes
sir.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
the
commission
--
the
commission's
one
reference
on
this
point,
sir,
is
the
reference
to
the
awareness
that
nelson's
--
principals
of
the
two
companies
had
the
regulatory
requirements
of
the
law.
the
examiner
was
discussing
at
that
point,
at
the
point
cited
by
counsel,
he
was
discussing
both
the
violation
of
5
(4)
and
he's
also
discussing
various
safety
violation
that
had
been
discovered
in
road
checks.
certainly,
as
far
as
the
5
(4)
violation,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
he
found
no
specific
intent.
the
commission's
standard
is
somewhat
different,
however.
the
commission's
standard
is
that
if
the
person
--
the
one
mitigating
factor
that
can
be
discerned
from
other
commission
opinions
is
that
if
a
party
can
show
good
faith
in
terms
of
lack
of
awareness
of
the
law,
then
that
will
be
considered
a
mitigation
of
what
would
otherwise
be
found
to
be
unlawful
control,
a
mitigation
of
the
violation
so
that
perhaps
the
application
would
be
granted.
but
the
commission
does
not
require
--
does
not
set
a
standard
of
a
specific
intent.
if
the
parties
were
aware
of
the
requirements
of
the
law
and
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
on
this
record,
then
the
violation
is
not
mitigated.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
the
commission
--
the
commission
at
page
23
of
the
record
is
quoting
division
4
and
it
states
that
it
should
be
emphasized
that
nelson
and
gilbertville's
principals
are
not
new
to
transportation
or
to
section
5
proceedings.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
page
23
in
the
quotation
from
division
4
about
halfway
down
the
page.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes
and
division
4
where
i
discuss
this
point
at
pages
92
and
93
of
the
record,
go
into
that
in
somewhat
greater
detail,
the
experience
of
the
parties
in
the
trucking
industry
and
their
experience
in
the
acting
pursuant
to
the
regulatory
requirements
of
section
5.
that
citation
is
92
and
93
of
the
record.
i
may
say
that
the
examiner's
finding
in
this
respect
is
inconsistent
with
other
parts
of
his
opinion
because
the
examiner
found
that
an
overall
plan
had
developed
at
some
stage
or
another,
an
overall
plan
had
been
conceived
and
followed
to
enlarge
nelson
company
into
a
more
substantial
and
more
significant
carrier
in
the
mid-atlantic
new
england
area.
certainly,
the
conception
in
following
of
such
a
plan
is
inconsistent
with
a
finding
thereafter
that
the
parties
would
be
unaware
of
what
they
were
doing.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
no,
there
certainly
is
not,
sir.
but
i
should
point
out
how
this
enlargement
took
place.
this
enlargement
did
not
take
place
by
enlarging
nelson
company
itself.
it
took
place
by
means
of
the
acquisition
of
this
very
weak
company,
gilbertville
and
by
the
shifting
of
equipment,
personnel,
funds,
and
energies
into
the
general
commodity
service
which
that
carrier
was
able
to
provide
under
its
certificate.
now,
if
nelson
had
come
to
the
commission
in
march
1953
and
said,
“textile
industry
in
new
england
is
going
down,
we
would
like
to
carry
general
commodities
from
massachusetts,
connecticut,
rhode
island,
all
the
way
down
to
the
district
of
columbia,
they
would
have
had
to
prove
as
the
commission
requires
in
all
its
proceedings
that
there's
a
need
for
this
service.
they
did
not
so
request
and
yet
that
is
the
kind
of
authority
--
that
is
the
authority
which
they
would
have
if
this
application
would
have
been
granted,
taking
the
gilbertville's
certificate
and
adding
it
to
a
previous
acquisition,
the
byrnes
acquisition
by
nelson
company.
nelson
company
would
have
been
transmuted
from
a
textile
carrier
from
new
england
--
in
new
england
and
from
new
england
to
new
york
and
philadelphia
to
a
general
commodity
carrier
down
as
essential
part
of
the
eastern
seaboard.
that
would
be
presented
as
somewhat
considerably
different
question
and
the
--
that
emphasizes
of
course
the
importance
of
presenting
proposed
transactions
to
the
commission
that
section
5
requires.
since
we
don't
have
a
proposed
transaction,
the
commission
has
to
do
two
things
and
this
is
what
it
does
when
it
finds
a
violation
of
section
5
(4).
it
gives
weight
against
the
approval
of
a
merger
to
the
finding
of
violation
and
it
refuses
to
consider
any
benefits
which
are
based
upon
the
services
under
unlawful
control.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
other
than
the
conclusory
statement
on
page
23,
the
commission
cites
the
finding
of
division
4
and
that
it
says
that
it
has
carefully
considered
the
evidence
in
the
pleadings
and
it
finds
no
basis
to
support
a
finding
that
the
transaction
for
which
authority
is
sought
would
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest
under
all
the
circumstances.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
it
certainly
involves
that
finding
sir,
but
on
the
other
hand,
it's
clear
from
the
commission's
opinion
in
this
case
and
in
other
cases
which
have
dealt
with
these
questions
from
the
central
of
georgia
case
which
the
commission
cites
here
the
leading
authority
on
the
point
that
a
violation
can
be
overridden.
the
result
of
the
violation
is
that
a
party
assumes
or
has
imposed
upon
him
a
burden.
he
has
to
do
more
than
show
consistency
with
the
public
interest.
he
has
to
show
strong
affirmative
benefits
to
flow
from
the
merger
or
as
the
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes
sir.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes
sir.
i
think
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
the
policy
of
the
commission,
the
balancing
which
the
commission
undertakes
to
do
as
a
matter
of
general
rule
is
very
clear
and
where
the
commission
has
stated
this
in
general
terms,
and
where
the
record
is
overwhelmingly
in
support
of
such
a
conclusion.
i
may
say
that
under
a
different
act,
we
have
the
woko
decision
which
was
cited
in
our
brief
under
the
communications
act
in
329
u.s.
this
court
has
held
that
the
balancing
is
up
to
the
commission
even
though
in
that
case
as
well
there
was
a
sanction
for
misrepresentation
to
the
federal
communications
commission
which
had
to
be
balanced
against
the
quality
of
service
and
one
other
specific
finding
on
this
point,
the
commission
in
that
case
had
dealt
only
with
the
importance
of
deterring
such
violations.
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
that
whatever
the
situation
might
be
in
another
case,
in
this
case,
there
was
nothing
to
balance
against
the
violation.
there
were
no
countervailing
public
benefits
which
could
have
outweighed
it.
there
was
no
evidence
introduced
to
shipper
needs.
there's
no
showing
that
existing
service
was
inadequate.
the
only
finding
by
the
examiner
who
would've
approve
the
merger,
the
only
finding
by
him
on
this
point
was
that
there
would
have
been
more
efficiency
and
greater
economy
in
the
related
services
which
are
developed
since
the
acquisition
of
1953,
particularly
he
mentioned
the
interchange
which
have
developed
between
the
carriers.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
i
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
i
would
go
that
far.
i
don't
know
why
i
have
to
go
that
far
in
march
1953
but
when
the
commission
was
finally
faced
with
it,
i
would
not
go
that
far
because
there
was
a
relationship
between
these
carriers.
and
if
that
relationship
had
been
up
and
developed
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
quite
get
the
question,
sir.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
alright,
that's
a
difficult
--
that's
a
difficult
question
to
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
i'm
sorry.
i
was
pointing
out
that
if
we
were
to
consider
this
as
a
proposed
transaction
that
is
admitting
--
eliminating
all
this
development
under
the
unlawful
control
then
there
might
be
a
serious
question
whether
the
commission
would
have
granted
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
applicants
in
this
case,
the
nelson
company
principals
tried
to
acquire
other
carrier
in
1953,
and
the
commission
turned
them
down
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
dormant
company
and
there
was
no
public
interest
shown
in
reviving
it.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
mr.
justice,
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
make
my
point
clear.
i
was
trying
to
distinguish
between
the
situation
in
1953
and
the
situation
in
1956.
in
1956,
assuming
there
were
no
violation,
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
the
merger
would've
been
approved
that
the
merger
would
have
been
found
consistent
with
the
public
interest
and
would
have
been
approved,
had
not
been
for
the
fact
that
the
support
for
this
had
to
rest
upon
a
violation.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes
sir.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
that
is
why
i
was
not
trying
to
--
i
was
trying
to
avoid
answering
that
question
because
i
did
not
wish
--
i
did
not
wish
to
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
and
that's
correct
sir,
yes.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes
sir.
i
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes
sir.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
that's
correct
sir.
i
was
referring
back
to
the
previous
relationship
to
indicate
how
this
situation
illustrates
the
importance
and
the
value
of
the
commission's
policy
of
giving
a
violation
weight.
that
it
is
significant
that
is
vital
for
the
commission's
administration
of
this
statute
that
the
carriers
come
in
before
they
consummate
transactions.
and
then
if
they
don't
come
in,
not
only
can
services
be
developed
if
you're
not
in
the
public
interest
but
the
matter
cannot
even
be
cured
by
its
related
application
because
the
--
under
their
unlawful
control,
they
couldn't
change
the
circumstances.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes
sir.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
the
commission's
standard
on
this
and
which
we're
defending
here
is
that
if
the
party
that
the
one
mitigating
possible
factor,
the
one
mitigating
possible
fact
is
not
possible
from
the
way
the
examiner
considered
it
but
awareness
of
the
law.
the
examiner,
i
may
say,
was
considering
this
from
the
point
of
view
of
fitness
of
the
applicants.
are
they
of
such
character
that
they
can't
be
trusted
with
a
certificate?
the
commission's
policy
is
quite
different.
the
commission's
policy
is
that
the
public
interest
requires
a
deterrent
against
such
violations.
and
that
therefore,
as
a
matter
of
the
public
interest,
it
will
give
weight
against
the
approval
of
a
merger
when
a
violation
has
occurred.
this
was
the
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
knowingly.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
with
awareness,
yes.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
we
have
illustrated
that
by
a
number
of
cases
which
we've
cited
from
the
commission.
where
they've
mitigated
or
they've
agreed
to
ignore
a
violation
when
the
party
showed
good
faith
confusion
about
the
law,
uncertainty,
lack
of
legal
advice,
that
kind
of
situation.
here,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question.
the
parties
are
aware
of
the
requirement
of
the
law
and
that
they
want
to
add
with
this
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes
sir.
and
they
don't
claim
that
they
didn't
know
what
the
law
required.
the
examiners
findings
themselves
show
this
in
a
sense
that
he
found
the
conception
of
a
plan
to
increase
the
service
to
enlarge
the
service
of
the
original
carrier
through
the
acquisition.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
no
sir.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
if
you
found
there
were
no
violation
and
the
matter
would
have
to
go
back
for
the
commission
to
consider
as
a
matter
of
discretion
under
section
5.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes
sir.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes
sir.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes
sir.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
it
does
have
relevance
in
the
sense
that
the
commission
did
not
have
an
automatic
rule
of
denying
a
merger
when
it
finds
a
violation.
it
does
--
there
is
an
element
of
balancing
that
remains,
i
quoted
that
language
to
indicate
that
the
commission
had
undertaken
to
make
such
a
balancing
and
had
considered
all
of
the
circumstances
before
it's
concluded
that
the
merger
should
not
be
approved.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
that's
correct.
the
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes
sir.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
there
would
have
to
be,
that's
right.
since
the
commission
is
the
body
in
charge,
deciding
whether
applications
such
as
this
should
be
granted.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
spend
just
one
moment
on
the
statutory
provisions
which
have
been
discussed
earlier
that
are
set
out
on
pages
64
and
65
of
the
brief.
the
appellants
make
a
rather
extensive
intricate
argument
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
finding
of
violation
by
use
of
affiliation,
affiliation
provisions
and
without
use
of
the
affiliation
provisions.
on
page
64
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
is
section
5
(4)
which
is
the
basic
statutory
prohibition.
it
states
that
it
is
unlawful
for
any
person
without
commission
approval
to
enter
into
a
transaction
requiring
such
approval
or
to
accomplish
control
over
management
in
a
common
interest
of
any
two
or
more
carriers.
however,
such
result
is
attained
whether
directly
or
indirectly.
on
the
facing
page,
section
5
(6)
provides
a
definition
of
affiliation
and
section
5
(5)
in
intervening
subsection,
states,
that
certain
transactions
by
carriers
and
persons
affiliated
with
them,
i'm
now
reading
at
the
top
of
65,
shall
be
deemed
to
accomplish
or
effectuate
the
control
or
management
in
a
common
interest
of
two
carriers.
this
is
the
language
i've
just
read
as
an
echo
of
section
5
(4).
so
what
these
two
additional
provisions
state
is
that
certain
transactions
by
carriers
and
other
persons
were
found
to
be
affiliated
with
them,
will
constitute
a
violation
of
the
--
this
single
prohibition
that
is
in
the
statute
of
section
5
(4).
the
appellants
go
to
some
effort
to
try
to
separate
these
provisions
of
law
and
to
say
that
a
different
kind
of
finding,
a
different
kind
of
evidence
is
required
to
find
a
violation
of
the
affiliation
provisions
and
is
required
to
find
a
violation
of
5
(4).
but
actually,
that
is
certainly
not
what
congress
intended
when
it
passed
this
statute
and
certainly
not
what
the
law
provides.
the
committee
reports
are
very
clear
on
this
point.
they
state
that
these
5
(5)
and
5
(6)
were
adopted,
and
i'm
quoting
from
committee
reports,
to
spell
out
and
make
clear
the
various
possible
forms
of
indirect
control
which
5
(4)
was
intended
to
prohibit.
to
make
sure
that
5
(4)
which
is
the
single
prohibition
that
the
act
contains
was
construed
to
prevent
indirect
control
regardless
of
the
device
that
was
used.
in
other
words,
a
finding
of
affiliation
in
this
case
is
a
finding
simply
that
kenneth
nelson
was
acting
on
behalf
of
nelson
company.
and
the
finding
of
violation
by
use
of
these
provisions
is
no
more
than
a
finding
that
the
unlawful
control
was
accomplished
indirectly
through
an
affiliated
person,
indirectly
through
kenneth
nelson.
this
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
findings
without
using
those
provisions.
it's
the
same
thing
because
it's
clear
that
if
any
violation
did
occur
in
this
case,
it
occurred
because
kenneth
nelson
purchased
the
company
and
by
means
of
his
management
and
control
of
it.
as
i
said
earlier,
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
the
record
amply
supports
the
commission
on
this
point.
the
commission
certainly
were
justified
in
its
finding
that
a
violation
had
occurred
and
that
it
had
occurred
through
the
medium
of
the
kenneth
nelson's
purchase
and
control
of
the
second
carrier.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes,
there
is
certainly
a
freedom.
an
application
could
be
filed.
of
course
this
order
here
is
more
than
an
order
to
denying
the
application
to
merge.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes
sir.
they
certainly
could.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes,
i'm
coming
to
that
right
now,
mr.
justice.
the
final
issue
of
course
is
whether
the
commission
properly
ordered
kenneth
nelson
to
sell
his
stock
in
gilbertville
company.
once
you've
decided
not
to
approve
the
merger,
obviously
it
will
do
something
to
eliminate
the
unlawful
situation
which
had
--
it
had
decided
not
to
legalize.
it
had
to
decide
--
it
had
to
act
under
section
5
(7)
of
the
act.
it
had
to
direct
appellants
to
take
such
action
as
may
be
necessary
in
its
opinion
to
prevent
continuance
of
the
violations.
the
order
of
divestiture
in
this
case
which
the
commission
adopted
is
its
usual
remedy
for
unlawful
acquisitions
insofar
as
appellants
cite
various
cases
in
their
brief
from
context
such
as
unlawful
advertising
pertaining
to
that
for
the
proposition
that
agencies
should
not
use
the
harshest
available
alternative
if
there
are
several
alternatives
present.
insofar
as
situations
under
other
laws
may
be
relevant,
we
have
cited
and
we
believe
it's
appropriate
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
the
division
4
order
stated
that
the
party
should
terminate
their
violations.
they
did
not
specifically
order
divestiture.
we've
cited
in
our
brief
a
number
of
cases
which
indicate
that
the
commission
considers
the
words
‘termination'
and
‘violation'
to
be
equivalent
of
divestiture.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
starrett
urges
that
the
parties
never
presented
the
issue
of
divestiture
to
the
commission
to
division
4
in
the
exceptions.
we've
checked
the
exceptions
and
the
exceptions
to
the
division
4.
one
of
the
parties
mentioned
divorcement.
the
bureau
relied
upon
a
case
which
was
a
divestiture
case.
but
they
did
specifically
request
termination
of
the
violation.
now
the
division
regarded
that
as
a
request
for
a
divestiture
order
and
it's
so
stated
in
discussing
the
contentions
of
the
parties.
the
division
that
entered
this
termination
order
which
in
other
cases
i've
said
had
been
considered
to
be
to
mean
divestiture.
the
parties
went
to
the
commission
and
said
that
order
is
so
vague.
we
can't
understand
what
it
means
and
the
commission
then
elucidated
what
it
meant
and
directed
the
various
appellant
to
sell
their
interest
in
gilbertville
company.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
again,
we
have
mr.
justice,
a
situation
where
the
agency
has
a
general
policy
of
ordering
divestiture
unless
there
are
some
circumstances
which
make
the
relief
either
inadequate
or
harsh
to
innocent
parties.
our
brief
has
cited
cases
in
which
the
commission
--
one
case
in
which
the
commission
considered
it
too
harsh
to
innocent
parties
and
use
the
voting
trust.
in
other
case,
in
which
considered
it
inadequate
to
cure
the
violation
and
it
ordered
something
even
more
drastic
than
divestiture.
the
--
it
does
have
a
general
policy
if
those
situations
do
not
obtain
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
it
has
also
so
stated
in
another
case.
it
says
--
and
the
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
which
they
found
divestiture
would
be
inadequate
nigro
trucking
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
the
commission
said,
instead
of
the
usual
remedy
of
ordering
divestiture,
we
will
have
to
do
something
more
drastic
in
this
case
which
they
then
proceeded
to
do.
the
--
as
far
as
considering
the
available
alternatives,
the
commission's
opinion
did
not
--
truly
does
not
discuss
the
matter
in
any
detail,
did
not
discuss
the
matter
and
the
availability
of
other
alternatives.
however,
after
the
entry
of
the
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
i
don't
think
this
court
has
had
a
case
under
section
5
before
your
honor.
on
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
that's
correct.
it
should
be
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
that's
correct
sir.
i
should
--
i
should
mention
as
far
as
other
contexts
are
relevant.
i
think
that
the
antitrust
context
is
somewhat
relevant
and
this
court
has
held
in
the
antitrust
situation
that
divestiture
is
obviously
the
natural
remedy
for
an
unlawful
acquisition.
that's
the
view
that
judge
wyzanski
took
in
this
case
that
divestiture
has
a
perfect
fitness
for
a
violation
of
an
illegal
acquisition.
the
appellants
suggest
that
somehow
the
two
companies
should
be
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
it
was
spelled
in
large
part
out
of
--
that's
correct.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well
it
was
--
the
control
was
--
the
existence
of
the
control
was
spelled
out
in
large
parts
from
these
in
many
activities
that
the
two
companies
engaged
in
but
it's
quite
clear
that
the
reason
why
they
did
this
is
because
kenneth
nelson
purchased
gilbertville
company.
it's
not
a
normal
business
relation
to
move
into
someone
else's
terminal
to
share
offices,
to
share
telephone
numbers,
and
do
all
these
other
things.
and
the
commission
found
specifically
that
this
was
done
by
virtue
and
resulted
--
this
resulted
from
the
kenneth
nelson's
purchase
and
control.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
i
think
it's
clear.
it
would
have
been
rather
difficult
to
police
an
order
which
would
tell
two
carriers
not
to
do
business
with
one
another
because
of
such
violation.
but
aside
from
that,
the
crucial
aspect
--
the
vital
aspect
of
the
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
the
divestiture
would
not
be
very
difficult
to
believe
that
they
sell
the
stock
and
they
sell
it
to
a
third
independent
party,
we
know
that
it's
been
carried
out.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
the
commission
has
--
the
commission's
order
specified
that
it
can't
be
sold
to
anyone
who
is
affiliated
with
the
nelson
company
interest.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
i
presume
that
gilbertville
could
continue
to
interchange
freight
with
nelson
company
as
a
matter
of
normal
business
relations.
what
the
commission
has
found,
was
that
the
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
that
is
hypothetical,
sir,
which
i
can't
very
well
answer.
i
don't
--
i
can't
imagine
that
any
independent
business
concern
would
have
done
what
gilbertville
did
with
nelson
company
during
these
three
years.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
there
was
an
acquisition
of
control
and
the
acquisition
was
that
of
kenneth
nelson.
and
the
commission
has
found
that
that
acquisition
was
a
means
by
which
the
unlawful
control
occurred.
the
only
alternative,
which
is
suggested,
that
somehow
the
company
should
be
separated
but
that
kenneth
nelson
should
be
left
as
the
owner
of
gilbertville
company.
i
can't
imagine
that
the
commission
is
required
to
assume
that
any
order
of
termination
would
lead
him
to
act
contrary
to
the
interest
which
has
been
shown
during
this
period
that
the
commission
had
on
the
hearing.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
we
refer
to
a
case
in
another
context
as
you
did,
your
honor,
the
dupont
case,
it
was
suggested
that
--
the
court
stated
that
it'll
pass
through
the
stock
would
not
be
adequate
because
the
stockholders
shouldn't
--
the
court
should
not
be
required
to
assume
that
the
stockholders
would
act
contrary
to
their
interest.
it
was
very
clear
what
kenneth
nelson's
interests
were.
at
least
it's
clear
enough
for
the
commission
to
have
acted
on
that
basis.
the
arguments
against
divestiture,
i
may
say
your
honor,
were
also
presented
to
the
commission
after
the
entry
of
the
order
of
june
1959.
the
appellants
at
that
point
petitioned
for
reconsideration
and
raised
all
the
arguments
which
are
now
being
raised.
they
stated
the
order
was
too
harsh
and
they
suggested
that
if
the
commission
issued
an
order
directing
him
not
to
share
terminals,
not
to
interline
freights,
not
to
use
vehicles,
evidently,
not
to
do
--
not
to
conduct
business
relations.
this
was
opposed
--
the
bureau
opposed
it
on
the
ground
that
the
unlawful
control
by
kenneth
nelson
was
an
integral
part
of
the
violation
and
that
the
alternative
would
essentially
left
and
retain
the
fruits
of
the
unlawful
conduct.
the
petition
was
denied
in
february
of
1960.
and
then
appellants
proposed
a
very
interesting
second
alternative.
they
proposed
a
filed
petition
with
the
commission
and
proposed
to
cancel
the
nelson
company
certificate
if
they
could
retain
gilbertville.
and
this
indicates
the
truth
of
what
i
spoke
of
earlier
the
value
of
the
acquisition.
the
value
of
this
related
service
that
has
developed
over
the
years
had
become
even
greater
than
that
of
the
original
company
which
had
initiated
this
--
this
development.
the
commission
denied
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
it
could
be.
the
situation
might
arise
in
which
the
commission
would
find
unlawful
control.
i
don't
think
--
but
i
--
i
don't
think
that
that
would
necessarily
follow
from
any
specific
cooperative
activities.
the
essential
aspect
of
this
--
the
order
of
the
commission
is
its
belief.
and
i
think
the
belief
is
amply
supported
by
the
record
that
if
you
did
separate
these
two
companies,
this
kind
of
relationship
would
never
arise.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
undoubtedly
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
undoubtedly,
he
might
--
he
might
continue
some
of
them,
your
honor.
but
for
example
kenneth
nelson
stated
on
the
stand
that
he
--
when
he
interchanges
freight
in
new
york,
he
always
gives
--
naturally,
he
gives
priority
to
the
nelson
affiliate
first,
it's
his
testimony.
well,
i
can't
see
any
reason
why
an
independent
company
would
particularly
give
priority
to
this
other
company
unless
there
was
some
kind
of
relationship
that's
existing.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes
sir.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
we
can
face
that
situation
in
another
day.
i
think
it's
certainly
adequate
for
the
commission
to
conclude
that
this
is
the
way
to
terminate
the
violation
and
this
is
essentially
the
only
way
to
terminate
a
violation
which
is
affected
by
--
and
accomplished
by
a
purchase
of
stock
and
the
management
drawing
the
companies
more
and
more
closely
together.
i
should
point
out
that
i
did
not
mean
by
omission
to
ignore
the
specific
relations
that
kenneth
nelson
had
with
nelson
company
to
suggest
that
the
entire
case
was
build
up
out
of
these
cooperative
activities,
if
you
will.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
except
for
the
shifting
of
freight
without
papers.
i
think
that's
more
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
yes.
i
think
that's
somewhat
unusual
to
find
all
together
but
each
one
is
taken
separately
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
again,
sir,
i
find
difficult
to
answer
that
question.
the
commission
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
i
wouldn't
say
that
as
the
only
key.
we
cited
other
cases
of
the
other
relations.
we
have
other
cases
in
which
the
john
smith
that
you
suggest
was
a
lawyer
for
one
of
the
carriers
or
an
accountant
for
one
of
the
carriers
or
a
friend,
or
an
aunt,
or
any
kind
of
intermediary.
there
could
be
a
situation
where
many
of
these
factors
would
obtain
whether
it
would
not
be
unlawful
control.
if
there
is
a
finding
of
unlawful
control
and
the
unlawful
was
--
control
was
effectuated
through
john
smith,
well
that
is
in
effect
the
finding
that
john
smith
is
not
an
independent
businessman.
he
is
acting
in
the
interest
of
on
behalf
of
one
carrier
when
he
controls
the
second,
and
that's
the
violation.
and
the
commission
invariably
required
divestiture
from
that
person
who
acted
on
behalf
of
the
--
of
one
carrier
when
he
controls
the
other.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
there
--
the
commission
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
the
commission
made
a
finding
that
he
was
affiliated
with
nelson
company
and
that
is
of
the
statute
of
finding
that
taking
all
the
circumstances
together,
he
acted
on
behalf
of
nelson
company
in
his
control
and
purchase
of
gilbertville
company.
and
i
can't
see
how
that
conclusion
can
be
faulted.
this
--
well
one
decision
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
the
district
court
found
a
violation
taking
all
the
factors
together
and
said
that
this
is
not
contradicted
but
is
confirmed
by
the
statutory
provisions
on
affiliated
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
no,
he
did
not.
it
did
not
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
that's
right.
that's
correct.
i
did
point
out
that
as
the
legislative
history
shows,
5
(6)
and
5
(5)
were
not
intended
to
set
up
a
new
provision.
it
was
simply
intended
to
show
how
a
violation
of
5
(4)
can
be
carried
out
through
an
intermediary,
through
affiliated
interest.
and
since
the
only
stockholder
--
the
only
--
essentially
the
only
--
there
were
some
other,
kenneth
nelson's
wife
and
his
terminal
manager
has
held
some
share
the
stock,
he
was
the
only
beneficial
owner.
since
the
only
stockholder
in
gilbertville
was
kenneth,
it
is
clear
that
if
there
was
a
violation,
he
did
it.
it
could
have
been
done
by
any
of
the
other
parties
and
nelson
company
without
his
operation
of
the
company.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
no,
sir.
i
certainly
--
i
hope
i
didn't
say
that.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
no
i
said
that
where
the
commission
is
found
unlawful
control,
effectuated
by
affiliated
persons,
they
have
not
depended
upon
brother
--
fraternal
relationships.
they
are
dependent
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
that
he
acted
on
behalf
of
them
whether
he
was
the
initiating
party
or
whether
he
was
merely
a
front
may
depend
on
the
facts
in
each
case.
i
--
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
well,
i
would
assume
that
if
there
were
some
--
merely
some
of
these
factors
that
were
involved,
they
wouldn't
--
if
they
would
have
a
finding
of
unlawful
control,
the
government
wouldn't
break
it
up
then
there
would
be
no
reason
to
break
it
up.
carriers
of
all
kinds
have
cooperative
relations.
and
the
commission
is
supposed
to
determine
when
this
amounts
to
unlawful
control
accomplished
without
approval.
and
it's
so
found
in
this
case.
mr.
lionel
kestenbaum
mr.
justice,
i
suggested
that
if
there
were
one
or
two
of
these
factors
that
occurred
or
some
of
these
factors
that
occurred,
i
can't
conceive
on
the
situation
where
all
of
them
could
occur.
and
the
parties
were
independent
businesses.
it's
certainly
not
our
case
here,
it's
not
our
record
here
and
i
don't
know
how
we
can
answer.
frankly,
i
can't
--
i
can't
see
how
we
can
answer
the
hypothetical.
i
would
like
to
add
to
these
factors
of
relationships
which
are
so.
the
commission
is
supposed
to
judge
these
in
terms
of
the
industry
and
to
--
to
decide
for
itself
whether
these
were
normal
business
relations
between
independent
concerns.
i
think
the
record
is
amply
supported.
aside
from
the
business
relation
themselves,
there
is
the
specific
relation
of
kenneth
nelson
with
nelson
company.
he
was
a
stockholder
and
an
officer
up
to
september
‘51.
after
that,
the
finding
is
quite
clear
although
he
terminated
that
formal
relation.
he
was
in
effect
an
employee.
the
accountant
testified
that
he
was
a
freelance
tariff
consultant
but
the
only
person
who
have
--
whom
he
worked,
the
only
person
who
provided
any
of
his
income
as
tariff
consultant
was
the
nelson
company.
he
maintained
his
office
in
the
nelson
company
premises.
the
accountant
also
testified
that
kenneth
nelson
continued
to
work
for
nelson
company
after
taking
over
gilbertville.
and
this
finding
was
made
by
the
examiner
and
by
division
4.
under
these
circumstances,
i
believe
the
commission
had
ample
justifications
in
the
record
and
in
the
statute
defined
unlawful
control
and
violation
of
section
5
(4).
they
had
ample
justifications
for
using
that
and
considering
the
public
interest,
and
in
deciding
that
the
merger
should
not
be
granted,
and
thereafter
an
order
to
terminate
the
violation
in
directing
divestiture
of
stock.
