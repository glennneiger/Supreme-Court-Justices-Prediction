may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
two
working
companies
and
various
individuals
who
owns
stock
and
worked
with
companies.
the
case
began
a
few
days
more
than
seven
years
ago
when
an
application
was
filed
for
leave
--
for
approval
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
merge
these
two
companies.
an
agreement
had
been
made
expressly
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
commission
that
the
companies
be
merged
by
stock
acquisition
and
later
consolidation.

5

of

of

to

b
on

82,
whenever
a
transaction,
that
includes
a
merger
of
this
sort,
is
proposed
the
carriers

shall
permit

shall
present
an
application
in

commission
shall
take
certain
action,
then
the
commission
shall
approve
if
it
finds
that
the
merger
is
in
the
public
interest.
gilbertville
is
a
fairly
small
general
commodity
carrier
operating
in
new
england
and
new
jersey.
nelson
is
a
specific
commodity
carrier,
as
far
as
interstate
rates
are
concerned.
it's
associated
with
the
textile
industry.
also
has
general
commodity
authority
intrastate
into
states.
two
and
a
half
months
after
the
merger
application
was
filed
then,
an
investigation
was
started
by
the
commission
under
section
5
(7)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
an
investigation
to
determine
whether
control
or
management
of
the
two
carriers
in
a
common
interest
had
been
effectuated
and
was
continuing.
these
two
proceedings
were
consolidated
for
hearing
and
later
and
gradually
they
grew
more
and
more
bound
together
as
the
commission
added
decision
after
decision.
a
lengthy
hearing
was
held
resulting
in
many
pages
of
transcript
for
the
trial
examiner.
participating
in
the
hearing
in
addition
to
the
applicants,
representatives
of
the
eastern
territory
railroads
as
protestants
and
13
large
competitors,
motor
carriers
in
new
england
as
well
as
the
bureau
of
the
commission,
that
is
the
bureau
of
--
ingoing
compliance.
there
were
four
issues
presented
to
the
trial
examiner
and
to
everyone
else
who
decided
the
case.
one
of
these
issues
was
whether
there
had
been
a
violation
of
law
that
is
control
or
management
in
the
common
interest
one
way
or
another.
secondly,
if
there
were,
was
that
violation
continuing?
because
a
peculiarity
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
that
the
remedial
authority
of
the
commission
is
to
order
such
action
as
it's
necessary
to
prevent
continuance
and
other
language
of
the
section
makes
it
very
clear
and
the
appellees
don't
contest
that
continuance
is
a
prerequisite
to
their
remedial
jurisdiction.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
yes
sir.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
very
well.
first,
before
i
do,
let
me
say
what
i
construe
to
be
the
facts.
we
had
always
thought
that
the
facts
in
the
case
were
the
findings
of
facts
that
the
commission
sustained
by
a
substantial
evidence.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
we
had
always
thought
that
the
findings
of
facts
in
the
case
by
the
commission
sustained
the
substantial
evidence
for
the
basic
factual
reference.
in
this
case,
i
note
this
as
we
come
through.
the
district
court
has
departed
from
the
facts
expressly
and
indeed
appellees
rely
on
the
trial
examiner's
facts
which
were
different.
now,
with
those
--
with
that
notation,
let
me
outline
just
very
briefly
what
the
commission
found
to
be
factually
true.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
yes
sir.
yes
i
am,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
the
nelson
company,
l.
nelson
&
sons
transportation
company
originated
first
as
a
partnership
of
a
woman,
mrs.
linnea
nelson
and
two
of
her
sons
and
was
later
incorporated,
other
sons
and
members
of
the
family
came
into
the
business.
and
then
in
1950,
the
--
mrs.
nelson,
l.
nelson
died.
at
that
point,
the
sons
and
daughters
of
l.
nelson
started
to
go
their
separate
ways,
some
of
them.
charles
chilberg
managed
the
corporation
as
approximately
the
executives.
oscar
chilberg
sold
the
stock
and
he
went
and
managed
a
garage
in
philadelphia
and
he
has
very
little
further
connection
in
this
case.
kenneth
nelson
sold
his
stock
in
september
--
september
22
of
1951.
he
continued
thereafter
to
have
an
association
with
nelson
company
solely
as
nelson
company
was
a
client
of
his
as
a
tariff
consultant.
let
me
come
to
that
in
a
moment.
another
son,
howard,
sold
his
stock
and
went
to
the
navy.
he
went
back
to
a
surveying
job
with
the
navy
really.
a
daughter
also
sold
her
stock.
thus,
there
were
three
stockholders
left
in
l.
nelson
&
sons
and
they
are
the
first
three
individuals
listed
in
the
caption
of
the
case,
charles
chilberg,
clifford
nelson,
and
kenneth
nelson.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
with
--
there
were
--
charles
chilberg
is
a
half
brother
of
the
--
of
these
two.
i
mentioned
that
kenneth
continued
to
have
some
association
with
nelson
company.
this
is
a
highly
rooted
issue
in
this
case.
the
commission
found
that
kenneth
was
a
freelance
tariff
consultant
until
march
1
of
1953.
now,
the
date,
march
1
of
1953
is
important
because
the
purchase
by
kenneth
nelson
of
the
stock
with
gilbertville
company
did
not
occur
until
march
3,
that
is
his
taking
over
control,
does
not
occur
until
march
3.
a
contract
dated
march
2
was
signed
march
3,
the
evidences
says
that
the
escrow
money
was
deposited
in
march
3.
later
in
july,
the
stock
was
actually
transferred,
but
i
take
it
that
march
3
would
be
or
could
be
its
significant
date.
the
appellees,
therefore,
contend
that
the
march
1
finding
by
the
commission
was
an
error
and
they
referred
to
certain
alleged
evidence
to
that
effect
in
the
record.
the
evidence
on
which
they
would
ask
this
court
to
find
that
the
commission
was
in
error
and
therefore
affirmed
the
commission,
consisted
of
the
testimony
of
an
accountant
who
had
indicated
that
he
was
testifying
solely
from
income
tax
returns
who
indicated
that
he
could
not
tell
from
the
income
tax
returns
from
the
material
he
had
when
during
a
year
money
was
received.
who
was
confused,
admittedly
so,
who
inadvertently
gave
incorrect
answers
many
times.
this
is
all
in
the
record
and
it's
outlined
in
our
brief.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
we
do
not
challenge
the
finding,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
appellees
do.
then
this
accountant
was
asked
the
question
as
to
whether
any
of
the
money
or
the
salary
or
income
or
what
have
you
that
kenneth
was
supposed
to
receive
from
1953,
was
received
for
services
rendered
after
he
bought
the
stock
from
gilbertville
company.
the
accountant's
answer
where
some
of
that
would
have
to
be
which
leaves
the
impression
that
he
was
talking
about,
in
the
first
place,
the
time
he
received
the
money
and
at
the
time
the
services
were
rendered.
and
secondly,
that
he
was
guessing,
as
he
must
have
been
guessing
because
he
had
no
way
of
knowing.
this
sounds
like
delving
in
trivia
and
i'd
be
reluctant
to
do
it
except
the
appellees
have
made
such
a
point
of
it.
and
the
appellees
are
attempting
to
find
here
some
relationship
to
sustain
the
commission's
action.
they
could
argue,
i
suppose,
if
they
--
that
they
could
create
an
overlap
of
the
dates,
that
there
would
be
such
a
relationship
here.
when
i
use
the
word
‘relationship',
i'm
referring
to
the
definition
of
affiliation
in
section
5
(6)
of
the
act.
then
there's
one
other
question
as
to
nelson's
--
as
to
kenneth
nelson's
career
as
if
the
--
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
the
complaint
attacked
a
number
of
orders,
mr.
justice,
although
at
the
district
--
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
the
order
of
divestiture
is
one
of
the
factors,
mr.
justice.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
the
order
of
june
9
which
i
read
is
the
only
relevant
order
as
far
as
substance
is
concerned.
the
order
of
june
9
finds
a
violation
of
law
and
must
find
that
as
continuing.
it
denies
the
section
5
(2),
the
merger
application
which
the
examiner
had
concluded
would
moot
the
whole
investigation
question.
and
then
it
attacks
on
to
the
end.
it
orders
termination
of
the
violation
of
law
found
and
then
attacks
onto
the
end
of
the
divestiture.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
that
kenneth
nelson
sold
the
stock
at
gilbertville
company.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
we
want,
may
it
please
the
court,
a
reversal
of
the
district
court's
judgment.
we
contend
that
the
commission
was
in
error
on
all
three
or
four
as
the
court
--
well
of
these
points.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
denial
of
the
application.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
no.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
the
violation
of
5
(4)
and
that
the
violation
was
continuing
which
are
really
very
close.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
yes,
mr.
justice.
each
of
this
is
independent.
that
is
to
say
even
if
there
were
a
violation
of
law
--
even
if
they
were
continuing
--
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
yes.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
then
the
denial
of
the
merger
application
was
error.
moreover,
even
if
the
merger
application
weren't
granted,
the
divestiture
order
was
by
itself
error.
appellees
raised
some
question
also
as
to
the
commission's
finding
of
it.
kenneth
was
a
freelance
tariff
consultant.
i
don't
think
there
needs
to
be
much
said
about
that.
the
commission
found
him
freelance
and
consultant
that
is
an
independent
contractor.
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
did
not
have
other
clients
and
i
can
definitely
rest
there.
back
to
other
facts
then
and
i'm
leaving
for
the
moment
this
tariff
consultant
career
which
the
appellees
find
important.
the
purchase
of
gilbertville
company
was
accomplished
by
kenneth
nelson
going
after
--
this
was
a
year
and
a
half
after
he
had
severed
all
his
connections
with
nelson
company
except
for
this
freelance
tariff
consultant.
he
resigned
as
an
officer
director.
he
sold
his
stock.
it
was
purchased
by
kenneth
nelson
with
the
aid
only
of
oscar
who
had
previously
--
that
is
previous
to
kenneth,
left
the
nelson
company
and
was
earning
a
garage
in
philadelphia.
there
was
much
effort
spent
trying
to
show
that
there
was
some
money
of
the
nelson
company
that
went
to
this
purchase
or
some
other
connection
with
the
nelson
company
and
none
was
shown
and
none
appears
in
the
record.
the
commission
mentions
the
bergson
company.
bergson
is
an
outgrowth,
sort
of
a
continuation
as
it
were
of
the
administration
of
the
estate
of
mrs.
linnea
nelson.
it
owns
a
substantial
amount
of
real
estate,
part
of
which
is
three
--
is
some
four
terminals
which
are
used
by
the
nelson
company.
though
these
properties
used
by
the
nelson
company
is
terminal
four.
the
other
facts
and
these
i
take
it
are
the
ones
in
which
the
commission
thought
that
common
control
or
management
was
shown.
the
other
facts
include
evidence
with
respect
to
joint
use
of
terminal
facilities.
that
is
that
the
nelson
company
and
the
gilbertville
company
used
--
both
used
three
properties
which
were
owned
by
bergson
company
and
one
other
company,
both
as
terminals.
there's
nothing
unusual
about
joint
use
of
terminals
by
carriers.
it's
done
all
the
time
particularly
by
railroad
carriers,
grand
central
station
and
so
forth.
then
other
terminal
facilities,
long
line
communications
or
teletype
went
along
with
the
terminal
facilities
so
did
telephone.
these
items
were
paid
for
by
gilbertville
and
nelson
and
there's
never
been
any
evidence
or
any
suggestion
other
than
the
district
courts
that
there
was
anything
improper
in
the
method
of
each
paying
for
what
it
used.
there
has
been
no
suggestion
that
the
amounts
are
unreasonable.
the
district
court
observed
that
they
were
not
shown
to
the
other
than
arbitrary.
and
apparently
this
was
a
basis
of
his
decision.
the
basis
i
should
add
we
claim
as
clear
error.
the
burden
of
proof
was
most
plainly
on
the
bureau,
on
the
person
seeking
show
violation
of
law
and
it
was
conceded
to
be
by
bureau
counsel
for
the
district
court.
so
not
shown
to
be
other
than
arbitrary,
can
be
translated
to
reasonable
in
light
of
the
burden
of
proof
or
ought
to
be.
the
commission
speaks
of
a
pool
of
equipment
so-called
maintained
by
nelson
and
gilbertville
company
uses.
the
facts
are
that
the
nelson
company's
business
was
declining.
the
textile
industry
was
moving
out
of
new
england
and
that
the
nelson
company
was
tied
to
that
industry.
then
gilbertville
company,
on
the
other
hand,
was
a
company
which
had
been
undernourished
by
its
sole
stockholder
previously.
that
was
quite
obvious
from
the
debts
that
have
gone
up
and
so
forth.
but
then
it
had
very
valuable
operating
authorities.
kenneth
nelson
invested
substantial
amounts
of
zone
money
in
his
effort
and
he
was
young
and
vigorous,
and
brought
the
company
up.
but
meanwhile,
he
had
serious
capital
difficulties.
he
bought
equipment
as
fast
as
he
could.
let
me
add
parenthetically
that
he
bought
all
new
equipment
in
exception
of
four
used
vehicles.
he
bought
equipment
as
fast
as
he
could
but
in
the
meantime
he
had
to
use
equipment
to
run
the
business
and
he
leased
that
equipment.
he
leased
it
from
various
sources
and
he
leased
a
substantial
amount
by
far
in
the
majority
no
question
from
nelson
company.
but
that
was
equipment
that
gilbertville
needed
and
nelson
company
had
available.
the
evidence
is
very
clear
on
that.
there
was
no
special
accommodation.
let's
talk
about
the
same
group
of
drivers
but
it
appears
rather
clearly
that
the
drivers
in
this
general
area
as
the
drivers
everywhere
are
union
people
who
are
qualified
drivers,
the
ones
lower
in
the
seniority
list
frequently
don't
get
a
day's
work
here,
so
they
take
their
various
work
there.
and
that
is
all
that
adds
up
to
in
the
record.
much
time
was
spent
on
interlining
and
interchanging,
which
are
two
common
practices
growing
out
of
the
fact
that
motor
carriers
have
territorially
limited
operating
authorities.
one
motor
carrier
simply
is
not
authorized
to
take
a
particular
shipment
through;
therefore,
it
interlines
it
to
another
carrier.
interchanging
is
nothing
more
than
interlining
consisting
of
a
trade
of
trailers,
one
trailer
in
particular
being
laid
with
freight
that's
being
underlined.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
mr.
justice,
that's
--
this
was
a
narrative
statement
of
facts,
if
i
may
answer
it
this
way.
the
narrative
statement
of
facts
contained
many
inferences.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
my
legal
are
point
phrased
in
terms
of
a
question
presented
is
that
the
findings
of
the
commission
were
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
in
these
specific
respects.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
on
this
one
--
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
this
one
phase,
yes
mr.
justice.
i
don't
want
to
dwell
too
long
on
these
facts.
let
me
just
mention
the
same
source
for
accounting
advice
will
obviously
the
use
of
the
same
account
to
the
same
lawyers
are
relevant.
the
management
--
well,
managerial
discretion,
now
there's
a
finding
by
the
commission
that
each
carrier
acts
under
managerial
direction
from
officers
of
the
evidence,
this
the
court
will
find
is
based
on
three
incidents
and
three
incidents
alone
which
are
all
laid
out.
one,
that
kenneth
nelson
was
observed
operating
a
telephone
answering
questions
asked
by
a
woman,
and
so
forth.
nothing
was
heard
and
mr.
shea
who
testified,
let
me
call
the
court's
attention,
mr.
shea's
lack
of
hearing.
in
this
instant
and
also
when
he
observed
some
action,
he
complains
of
on
behalf
of
clifford
nelson,
mr.
shea
saw
lots
of
things
and
heard
nothing.
his
evidence
is
worthless
as
a
result.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
yes,
it
is,
mr.
justice.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
yes,
but
it
is
relevant,
i
would
submit,
to
the
other
factors
and
that
they
all
tend
to
pyramid.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
yes,
i
am.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
there
are
comments
that
the
companies
were
leveling
on
settlement
with
each
other
but
they're
not
based
on
any
complete
accounting
of
the
companies.
there
are
comments
about
comingling
traffic
which
have
no
basis
except
for
a
couple,
i
think
it's
four
very
minor
violations
--
violations
of
the
regulations
which
we've
met
but
not
control
and
management
in
the
common
interest
which
were
gathered
during
inspections
that
were
conducted
in
the
years
1954,
1955,
and
1956,
there
are
four
incidents.
they
mentioned
that
gilbertville
prospered
and
they
mentioned
a
couple
of
other
things.
but
let
me
move
on
if
i
may.
the
trial
examiner
confronted
with
these
four
issues
decided
although
no
one
of
the
acts
affords
a
clear
indication
of
control
and
management
in
the
common
interest
that
altogether
there
was
a
borderline
case
shown.
he
did
this,
i
should
add,
despite
the
presence
of
one
piece
of
evidence
in
exhibit
28
which
he
relies
on
record
45
and
46
which
was
ruled
out
by
division
4
and
is
thereafter
not
been
in
the
case.
nevertheless,
even
with
this
evidence,
the
trial
examiner
found
it
was
a
borderline
case
and
that
the
violation
if
there
were,
the
violation
he
found
was
at
some
time
that
cannot
be
determined
on
this
record
and
that's
relevant
because
the
time
of
the
violation
later
becomes
quite
relevant.
and
he
presumed
that
it
was
continuing.
he
said
twice,
it
was
presumably
continuing.
the
appellees
say
he
was
saying
that
it
was
presumably
the
time
he
was
writing
his
report.
there's
no
point
in
that
and
it's
quite
obvious
that
he
meant
presumably
at
the
time
of
the
hearing.
that's
important
because
there
is
no
further
finding
by
the
commission
by
division
4
or
by
the
commission
that
the
violation
was
continuing.
they
simply
refer
back
to
the
examiner
who
found
it
was
presumably
continuing.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
he
found
specifically
that
there
was,
on
all
the
facts,
a
borderline
violation
of
section
5
(4).
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
yes,
this
was
his
finding,
a
borderline
violation
at
some
time
which
can't
be
determined.
he
further
went
into
the
factors
which
are
relevant
to
appraisal
that
was
applied
or
an
application
for
merger.
he
found
that
there
would
be
advantages
from
the
merger
and
he
specifically
found
that
the
violation
of
law
did
not
render
the
applicants
unfit.
he
held
in
his
regard,
there's
no
evidence
of
extensive
or
flagrant
violations
of
the
act
to
regulations.
he
held
that
they
were
innocent,
degree
of
carelessness
but
not
willfulness.
he
specifically
found
that
there
was
no
willful
violation.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
his
finding
of
the
violation?
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
record
64,
i
believe
it
starts
--
well,
the
discussion
starts
earlier
then
in
the
second
paragraph
beginning
on
record
64.
the
finding
i
referred
to
with
respect
to
willfulness
is
at
record
72
and
73.
the
examiner
then
concluded
that
the
application
proceeding
in
the
merger
proceeding,
the
application
should
be
granted,
and
therefore,
the
section
5
(4)
proceeding
should
be
terminated
--
would
be
moot.
the
case
went
up
to
division
4
on
exceptions.
division
4
ruled
out
the
exhibit
that
i
referred
to,
that
is
ruled
out
a
piece
of
the
bureau's
evidence
which
the
examiner
considered
significant
then
concluded
that
on
the
full
chain
of
circumstances,
there
was
a
section
5
(4)
violation.
the
division
then
decided
to
make
--
taking
more
stringent
approach
as
they
characterize
it
with
respect
to
violations
of
law
and
their
effect
on
merger
proceedings.
a
more
stringent
approach
that
amounts,
we
say,
to
an
automatic
denial.
division
4
then
ordered
that
the
application
be
denied
and
that
the
appellants
be
ordered
to
terminate
the
violation
of
law
found.
then
on
appellant's
petition,
the
proceedings
were
reopened
on
the
record
and
the
full
commission
passed
on
them.
the
full
commission
substituted
that
division
4
has
reported
its
own
report
on
reconsideration,
new
narrative
statement
of
facts
and
so
forth
and
the
facts
are
different.
the
commission
reappraised
the
evidence,
stated
the
evidence
shows
as
follows.
the
commission
trained
--
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
the
--
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
i
said,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
there's
no
evidence
that
it
was
his
only
client.
the
particular
finding
can
be
read
either
of
two
ways.
it
can
be
read
that
the
commission
found
that
nelson
was
--
the
nelson
company
was
kenneth's
only
client
--
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
he
does
say
it,
yes.
there
is
no
evidence.
the
evidence
is
very
simple.
the
evidence
is
that
during
two
years,
1952
and
1953,
kenneth's
income
as
a
tariff
consultant
came
from
nelson
company,
this
is
the
accountant's
evidence,
period.
the
career
of
kenneth
as
a
tariff
consultant
started
in
1951.
we
know
nothing
about
1951.
we
know
nothing
about
the
income
that
kenneth
may
have
received
subsequent
to
1953
for
services
provided
earlier
and
there
is
no
more
direct
testimony
on
the
subject.
this
is
one
of
those
cases
that
kenneth
nelson
testified.
the
bureau
did
not
ask
him
anything
about
his
tariff
consultant
career.
the
commission
applied
in
the
rule
of
law.
they
relied
on
a
finding
that
kenneth
nelson
was
affiliated
with
nelson
company
and
this
is
the
language
of
section
5
(6)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
it
was
affiliated
with
the
nelson
company
at
the
time
he
purchased
the
stock
at
gilbertville
company.
therefore,
says
the
commission,
the
conclusive
presumption
of
section
5
(5)
applies,
therefore,
we
affirm
the
conclusions
in
the
prior
reports,
affirmed
the
conclusions
back
and
so
forth
in
the
statutory
language.
the
thing
that's
lacking
though,
quite
clearly,
is
any
specification
of
the
relationship
in
question.
section
5
(6)
says,
“a
person
shall
be
held
to
be
affiliated
with
the
carrier
if
by
reason
of
the
relationship
of
such
person
to
such
carrier
at
the
time
in
question,
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
that
the
affairs
of
any
carrier
on
which
control
may
be
acquired
by
such
person
will
be
managed
in
the
interest
of
such
other
carrier”.
it
asks
for
a
relationship
a
specific
time
that
makes
it
reasonable
to
believe
certain
things.
there's
no
specification
of
what
this
relationship
is.
was
it
because
he
was
a
brother?
the
appellees
denied
and
we
would
hesitate
to
think
so.
was
it
this
tariff
consultant
that
the
appellees
care
so
much
about?
was
it
appellees
say
it
is
an
intermediary
where
there
is
no
evidence,
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
the
record,
of
any
agency
relationship
and
particularly
there's
no
evidence
as
of
the
time
of
the
purchase
of
gilbertville
which
is
i
want
to
specify
by
the
commission
here,
because
section
5
(5)
requires
a
transaction.
it
only
applies
to
a
transaction,
it
doesn't
apply
to
other
relationships
or
what
have
you.
this
is
the
basis.
this
is
the
reason
why
we
say
and
there's
ample
support
i
believe
in
the
legislative
history,
there's
ample
support
in
the
mere
fact
that
congress
has
inserted
these
several
sections.
that
the
section
5
(5)
and
5
(6)
combination,
the
conclusive
presumption
is
essentially
a
different
thing.
it's
a
different
theory
of
law
and
so
forth
than
section
5
(4).
this
theory
then
was
picked
by
the
commission
departing
from
division
4
but
without
the
requisite
findings.
and
as
i
said
before,
there
is
no
finding
in
relationship
--
the
relationship
was
no
finding
of
continuance.
then
the
matter
went
up
to
the
district
court.
the
district
court
departed
on
the
facts
significantly
--
departed
on
important
facts.
the
district
court
said
that
the
basis
of
his
--
of
its
finding,
the
violation
was
the
fact
that
such
and
such
had
occurred
at
the
time
when
kenneth
had
--
was
not
shown
to
have
been,
it
was
not
shown
to
have
severed
his
relationship,
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
appellants
to
prove
they
did
not
commit
a
violation
of
law.
and
then
the
district
court,
as
an
unprejudiced
sophisticated
mind,
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
section
5
(4)
has
been
violated
and
the
district
court
has
not
viewed
sections
5
(5)
and
5
(6).
this
is
the
basis
of
our
saying
that
the
district
court
departed
from
the
long
established
rule
of
this
court
cited
among
other
courts
of
chancery
decision
as
frequently
cited
that
a
decision
must
be
reviewed
on
the
grounds
that
it
takes,
then
those
basically
would
be
the
first
--
the
points
with
respect
to
violation
of
law.
the
next
question
is
assuming
that
there
is
a
violation
of
law
as
we
see
there's
not,
what
is
the
result
of
it?
the
examiner
found
that
the
application
proceeding
or
the
merger
proceeding
should
be
proved
nevertheless.
division
4
over
struck
out
on
its
more
stringent
policy
and
the
commission
goes
along
with
division
4
and
adopts
a
more
stringent
policy.
it
quotes
from
a
previous
case,
central
georgia,
where
it
explains
that
previously
and
this
is
set
out
as
the
fitness
doctrine
in
appellant's
brief.
previously,
one
thing
that
was
weighed
was
a
violation
of
law.
it's
of
course
relevant
when
you're
weighing
it
in
this
fashion
to
determine
whether
or
not
it's
willful
because
an
innocent
violation,
i
take
it,
would
not
reflect
logically,
could
not
reflect
very
much
on
the
fitness
of
the
applicants.
the
views
--
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
if
the
court
please.
before
the
recess,
i
was
pointing
out
the
treatment
that
the
commission
gave
to
the
question
whether
the
application
for
approval
of
the
proposed
merger
should
be
granted.
the
commission
following
division
4
overruled
what
it
called
the
views
heretofore
followed
in
favor
of
a
more
stringent
approach.
now,
appellants
don't
contend
and
never
contended
that
the
commission
cannot
change
from
one
policy
to
another.
what
the
appellants
contend
is
that
the
policy
that
the
commission
adopted
in
this
case
is
not
a
rational
policy.
it's
not
a
policy
in
conformance
with
the
interstate
commerce
act
or
authorized
by
it.
the
more
stringent
approach
quite
simply
stated
is
that
once
a
law
violation,
as
the
report
calls
it,
is
found,
the
merger
--
the
approval
of
the
merger
will
be
denied
for
that
reason
and
for
that
reason
alone.
this
ignores
the
mandatory
language
of
section
5
(2),
which
instructs
the
commission
while
it
grants
discretion,
instructs
the
commission
to
weigh
the
public
interest
which
is
the
national
transportation
policy,
to
weigh
certain
specific
factors
and
adequate
transportation
service,
and
so
forth,
fix
charges
and
the
interest
of
employees.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
i'm
aware
of
that
mr.
justice.
i
take
it
that
they
accept
more
or
less
our
version
of
the
law
and
differ
as
to
what
actually
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
i'd
refer
the
court
to
page
23
--
22
and
23
of
the
record
which
is
the
relevant
language
of
the
commission.
on
page
22,
there's
a
lengthy
quote
from
the
central
of
georgia
decision
which
i
should
add
came
after
the
decision
of
division
4
in
the
present
case.
the
commission
summarizes,
saying,
“we
affirmed
in
the
foregoing
reviews
heretofore
followed.”
and
let
me
stress
heretofore.
that
law
of
violation
is
not
necessarily
at
bar
and
so
forth.
then
borrowing
the
language
of
division
4,
language
which
was
written
before
the
central
of
georgia
decision,
they
say
now
after
20
years,
more
than
20
years,
a
more
stringent
approach
is
warranted
that
is
a
more
stringent
approach
than
simply
weighing
a
law
of
violation.
they
then
proceed
to
consider
absolutely
nothing
but
the
fact
of
a
law
of
violation.
they
don't
consider
any
of
the
factors
that
were
abundantly
supported
in
the
record
and
that
the
examiner
weighed
and
let
the
examiner
to
conclude
in
favor
of
the
merger.
they
consider
simply
the
violation.
and
they
say
in
support
of
this
more
stringent
approach,
not
as
a
penalty
but
in
recognition
that
a
violation
of
the
law
should
not
be
rewarded,
that
existing
carriers
endeavoring
faithfully
to
comply
with
the
law
should
be
encouraged
and
protected,
not
as
a
penalty
but
to
make
the
appellants
an
example,
i
take
it.
and
then
they
say
that
the
violations
of
law
and
the
regulation
should
not
be
blessed
by
approval.
now,
this
is
perhaps
a
statement
of
two
different
reasons.
first,
that
the
violation
of
law
shouldn't
be
rewarded.
it
is
relevant
here
that
the
examiner
expressly
found
that
these
violations
were
not
willful
or
innocent.
there
is
no
contrary
finding
of
fact
in
the
record.
now,
the
division
and
the
commission
refer
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
prior
section
5
violation
--
or
excuse
me,
not
violation,
the
prior
section
5
proceeding
in
which
part
of
these
--
parts
of
the
principles
were
involved.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
this
is
the
one
where
the
principles
--
that
as
a
principle
stockholders
of
nelson
acquired
the
byrnes
routes.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
yes
sir.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
not
sure
that
a
sanction
is
necessarily
required
as
such.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
is
permissible,
yes.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
an
order
to
terminate
the
violation,
assuming
that
the
merger
authority
were
not
granted.
in
order
to
terminate
the
violation
or
violations
found
the
specific
instance
to
separate
and
stay
separate
the
two
companies
would
be
quite
sufficient.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
if
the
court
please,
there's
never
been
a
rule
of
law
that
relatives
can't
own
--
there's
never
been
a
rule
of
law
and
i
don't
understand
that
there
is
now
that
relatives
can't
own
trucking
companies.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
very
well.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
i
agree.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
the
commission
certainly
has
power
in
an
appropriate
case
to
order
as
far
as
divestiture,
but
what
it
has
power
to
order
is
such
action
as
is
necessary
to
prevent
continuance
of
the
violation.
there
is
no
reason.
appellants
can
see
no
reason
in
the
present
record
why
an
injunction
and
order
of
the
sort
the
division
4,
in
fact
entered
is
not
sufficient.
that
is
to
say
if
this
court
should
find
that
there
has
been
a
section
5
(4)
violation,
it
would
have
to
find
it,
we
submit,
on
the
same
ground
that
the
examiner
did,
that
there's
been
a
borderline
violation
consisting
of
these
many
intangibles
all
of
which
are
permissible
but
too
much
of
what's
permissible
is
not
permissible
or
some
such
theory.
in
which
case,
they
could
be
ordered
to
discontinue
these
things,
these
are
tangible
things.
these
are
things
which
can
be
discontinued
and
the
two
companies
can
continue
to
operate
properly
as
motor
carriers.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
we
do,
mr.
justice.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
yes.
that
is
a
decision
of
course
for
the
commission
to
make
--
to
weigh,
to
exercise
the
discretion
which
they
were
granted
by
congress
and
that
they
didn't
exercise
in
this
case
to
weigh
all
the
factors
and
determine
the
public
interest.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
in
it
of
itself
regardless
of
willfulness?
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
no.
no,
i
would
submit
it's
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
if
it
is
willful,
it
certainly
reflects
on
the
fitness
of
the
applicants
and
the
appellants
don't
question
it.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
--
which
bears
on
the
public
interest
indeed.
in
other
words
--
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
there
is
no
showing
of
a
knowing
violation
of
section
5
(4)
here.
the
examiner
pointed
out
that
the
view
of
the
appellants
that
their
conduct
had
been
innocent
could
not
be
said
to
be
wholly
groundless
or
something
with
that
sort.
indeed,
the
very
course
of
this
thing
through
the
commission
and
the
district
court
demonstrates
it.
here,
we
have
one
finding,
one
theory
by
the
examiner
substantially
adopted
by
division
4
but
then
a
brand
new
theory
substituted
by
the
commission,
and
then
again
a
new
theory
by
the
court.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
by
the
commission
was
the
conclusive
presumption
of
section
5
(5)
and
i'm
using
the
commission's
language
based
on
the
definition
of
affiliation
in
section
5
(4)
--
section
5
(6).
this
was
a
brand
new
theory.
this
involved
new
questions.
this
involved
new
time.
the
examiner
said
sometime
we
can't
tell.
the
commission
said
at
the
time
of
purchase,
the
time
of
the
acquisition
of
gilbertville.
this
involved
a
question
of
a
relationship
of
what
the
commission
would
deem
it
reasonable
to
believe.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
it
would
be
meaningful
and
particularly
the
contrary,
we
submit,
is
quite
meaningful.
actually,
divestiture
certainly
--
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
on
the
--
well,
on
the
merger,
it
is
--
if
it
is
not
willful,
it
does
not
bear
unfitness.
if
it
is
not
willful,
its
only
effect
on
the
merger
should
be
as
appellee
suggested
in
this
brief,
that
anything
which
is
the
product
which
is
found
to
be
the
product
of
unlawful
control
should
be
disregarded
certainly.
the
transaction
should
be
judged
free.
but
the
purpose
of
these
sections
is
to
create
a
strong
national
transportation
system
and
that
purpose
is
not
served
by
denying
something
which
would
be
a
benefit
to
transportation
for
no
rational
reason.
but
in
order
to
punish
a
violation,
particularly
that's
not
willful
--
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
there's
no
evidence
that
it
was
failing.
it
was
not
being
run
at
all
well
at
all
aggressively.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
it
was
in
poor
financial
condition,
the
equity
was
still
worth
many
thousands
of
dollars
but
--
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
it
was
much
improved.
it
was
much
improved
by
the
efforts
of
kenneth
nelson.
it
was
now
with
all
the
selling.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
well
--
excuse
me.
if
the
violation
is
innocent
--
let
me
backup
a
little
bit.
there's
first
the
question
of
what
the
violation
is.
this
is
something
on
which
the
various
decisions
in
the
commission
disagree.
secondly,
there
is
the
--
assuming
that
the
purchase
was
somehow
a
violation,
there's
a
question
of
whether
anything
is
gained
in
terms
of
national
transportation
policy
whether
there
is
any
necessity
and
necessity
to
prevent
continuance
of
the
violation
is
the
touch
zone
of
the
commission's
power
under
5
(7),
whether
there's
any
necessity
for
a
divestiture
order
to
prevent
continuance
of
this
violation.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
not
entirely
true.
your
honor,
you
can
argue
if
the
violation
and
now
i'm
here
i
guess
making
appellees
argument
for
them.
but
if
the
violation
were
willful
and
were
found
to
be
so,
then
the
commission
could
consider
that
in
determining
whether
an
injunction
would
be
sufficient,
for
example,
then
it's
certainly
relevant.
but
the
commission
should
weigh
all
these
things.
it
should
weigh
them
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
approve
the
proposed
merger.
and
it
must
weigh
them
again
in
divestiture.
and
the
striking
thing
about
the
divestiture
order,
i
have
just
a
moment
to
discuss
it
because
i
want
to
save
some
time.
the
striking
thing
about
the
divestiture
order
is
that
the
commission
simply
appended
it
to
the
order.
there's
nothing
in
the
report
to
indicate
why
divestiture.
there's
nothing
in
the
report
to
indicate
that
divestiture
is
going
to
be
ordered.
division
4
had
not
ordered
it.
it
had
never
been
an
issue
before
and
appellees
in
this
respect
were
misled
in
the
statement
of
brief
to
the
contrary
and
we
filed
the
appropriate
papers
with
the
clerk
to
show
that
it
had
never
been
an
issue.
it
was
simply
appended
to
the
order
without
any
mention
in
the
report.
now,
this
is
a
strange
and
a
somewhat
shocking
thing
perhaps.
we
would
submit
that
the
parties
are
entitled
to
know
why
divestiture
is
necessary.
we'd
submit
that
that's
an
issue
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
it's
an
issue
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
this
court
is
entitled
to
know
why
the
commission
thought
divestiture
was
necessary
or
that
the
commission
thought
it
was
necessary.
from
all
that
appears
in
the
report,
the
commission
may
have
been
under
the
deluded
notion
that
divestiture
was
required
for
some
reason
or
rather
that
there
wasn't
a
question
of
discretion.
nothing
of
this
sort
appears.
so
the
divestiture
order
simply
came.
now,
--
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
mr.
justice
goldberg,
first,
let
me
say
the
statute
is
not
blind.
the
statute
prescribes
certain
factors
to
be
weighed.
we
don't
challenge
that
the
commission
can
change
its
views,
its
policies
as
it's
indicated
by
experience
or
what
have
you.
that
it
should.
but
the
statute
prescribes
a
weighing
policy
and
20
years
of
experience
doesn't
indicate
such
obsolescence
as
the
commission
can
throw
that
away.
this
is
prescribed
by
congress
and
to
be
changed
by
congress.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
i'm
saying
that
the
policy
that
the
commission
apparently
adopted
in
this
case
and
perhaps
just
for
this
case
but
in
this
case
in
any
event
that
this
policy
is
not
a
rational
policy
and
is
not
a
policy
authorized
by
the
statute.
thank
you.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
if
the
court
please.
the
central
of
georgia
rule
or
the
rule
of
respect
for
law
that
mr.
kestenbaum
says
it
was
applied
here
doesn't
really
differ
significantly
from
the
fitness
rule.
i
think
that's
pretty
clear.
that's
a
sensible
weighing
process.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
only
that
rule
was
not
applied
in
this
case.
and
the
--
the
report
of
the
commission
shows
that
fairly
clearly.
mr.
kestenbaum
says
that
the
reason
for
that
is
a
so-called
section
5
rule
or
a
rule
that
prior
participation
in
section
5
proceedings
bar
us
any
claim
of
any
innocence
or
requires
an
automatic
assumption
or
presumption
of
willfulness.
he
further
refers
to
findings
or
rather
i
think
it's
more
appropriate
to
say
comment
made
by
the
examiner
not
repeated
by
the
commission
about
a
so-called
plan.
certainly,
there's
no
question
that
nelson
company
seeing
its
customers,
its
textile
industries
move
south
from
new
england
decided
that
it
should
obtain
some
route
south
and
it
did
so.
it
applied
to
the
commission
for
approval
of
their
purchase
which
was
denied
and
that
it
applied
by
the
commission
for
approval
of
another
purchase,
the
byrnes
purchase
which
is
approved.
this
is
the
plan
that
was
talked
about.
there's
no
question
about
and
it's
perfectly
lawful
plan.
the
expansion
of
carriers
indeed
in
territorial
terms
because
of
the
nature
in
which
routes
and
authorities
are
carried
up,
this
is
normally
done
by
acquiring
authorities.
there's
nothing
unusual
or
strange,
or
illegal
about
that.
but
then
to
say
that
participation
in
such
proceedings
is
equivalent
to
willfulness
of
any
violation
found
is
one
step
and
possible
step
forward.
in
this
very
case,
i
think
the
questions
from
the
court
and
mr.
kestenbaum's
really
inability
to
say
what
the
commission
did
or
would
have
done
in
specific
instance
that
shows
it.
there
is
no
--
there's
no
definition
to
this
as
the
examiner
said
to
the
--
it's
the
culmination
of
the
things.
here's
a
case
where
sum
of
the
parts
has
been
held
to
be
greater
or
the
whole
has
been
held
to
be
greater
than
sum
of
its
parts.
here's
a
case
of
a
number
of
innocent
things
which
are
held
to
add
up
to
a
violation
of
law.
as
the
examiner
said,
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
individuals
--
non-lawyers,
even
though
they
knew
about
section
5
and
demonstrated
indeed
their
deliberation
and
their
intent
to
comply
with
section
5
by
applying
for
approval
of
mergers,
indeed
this
one,
the
contract
is
expressly
subject
to
commission
approval
and
they
came
into
the
commission
for
this
merger.
that
these
people
can
predict
the
sophisticated
application
of
the
law
of
all
the
facts
adding
up
to
more
than
all
the
facts.
and
then
indeed
that
to
take
the
commission's
ground,
the
ground
the
commission
substituted
section
5
(5)
and
5
(6),
that
this
layman
could
say
that
it
was
going
to
be
possible
--
it's
going
to
be
reasonable
for
the
commission
to
believe.
those
are
terms
of
section
5
(6).
such
a
presumption
is
pretty
clearly
irrational
and
quite
illogical.
now,
mr.
kestenbaum
suggested
that
section
--
sections
5
(5)
and
5
(6)
and
as
5
(5)
with
the
definition
of
affiliation
in
section
5
(6)
are
exactly
the
same
thing
as
section
5
(4).
let
me
just
suggest
this.
section
5
(4)
applies
to
control
or
the
power
to
control
as
a
fact
something
that
can
be
proved.
section
5
(5)
and
5
(6)
applied
to
something
which
can
be
believed
even
if
it
can't
be
proved
and
the
congressional
history
makes
it
very
clear
that
this
was
the
intent.
section
5
(6)
says
that
a
man
is
affiliated
if
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
that
the
affairs
of
any
carrier
on
which
control
may
be
acquired
by
him
will
be
managed
--
will
be
in
the
interest
of
another
carrier.
that's
affiliation
and
then
section
5
(5)
makes
a
transaction
by
an
affiliate
like
by
conclusive
presumption
a
violation
of
law.
it
seems
fairly
clear
that
there
can
be
such
transactions
by
persons
where
it's
reasonable
to
believe
were
in
fact
there
is
no
control
or
power
to
control
created.
it's
a
different
test
and
congress
intended
it
to
be
a
different
test
so
that
it
could
be
proven
in
certain
cases
where
it
could
not
--
where
it
could
not
be
proven
as
a
matter
of
fact
under
5
(4).
it
could
be
proven
under
5
(5)
or
5
(6)
of
violation
of
law.
they
are
quite
different.
again,
5
(4)
can
apply
to
cases
that
don't
involve
transactions
since
section
5
(5)
requires
a
transaction,
requires
a
purchase.
and
in
light
of
these
sophisticated
rules,
to
say
that
the
mere
fact
of
prior
involvement
in
section
5
or
of
awareness
and
the
appellants
don't
deny
that
they
were
aware
of
section
5
(5)
or
section
5
generally
in
attempting
to
comply
with,
that
the
awareness
of
the
existence
of
section
5
means
that
any
stepping
across
the
line
even
a
vague
and
shadowy
line
of
this
sort
is
willful.
there
can
be
no
such
logical
presumption.
it
must
be
irrational.
mr.
loyd
m.
starrett
they
were
not,
mr.
justice.
the
investigation
proceeding
was
filed
some
two
and
a
half
months
after
the
application
for
merger
was
filed.
thank
you.
