mr.
david
a.
lindsay
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
treaty
case.
it
arises
under
our
income
tax
convention
with
the
united
kingdom
and
concerns
the
scope
of
article
xiv
of
that
convention
which
exempts
british
residents
from
united
states
tax
on
capital
gains.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
exemption
in
article
xiv
embraces
capital
gains
in
an
american
domestic
trust,
which
are
retained
as
corpus
and
held
for
future
distribution
when
all
the
beneficiaries,
the
income
beneficiaries
and
the
remaindermen
alike
are
residents
of
the
united
kingdom.
the
facts
are
simple.
petitioner
is
an
american
trustee
of
an
inter
vivos
trust.
the
trust
was
created
in
1947
by
an
english
grantor.
the
english
grantor
is
the
life
income
beneficiary.
his
wife
is
a
contingent
life
income
beneficiary.
his
children
are
the
remaindermen.
there
are
certain
contingencies
with
respect
to
the
remainder
interest
which
could
shift
the
interest
in
the
trust
corpus
and
the
retained
gains
among
the
grantor's
family,
particularly
between
the
children
of
the
grantor
and
the
grantor
himself.
in
1954
and
1955,
the
trustee's
sole
securities,
realized
gains,
pay
the
tax,
sued
for
refund
under
article
xiv,
which
refunds
were
allowed
by
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
following
american
trust
company
v.
smyth
in
the
ninth
circuit
which
held
favorably
for
the
trustee
and
the
beneficiaries
on
the
issue
presented
before
this
court.
the
court
below
reversed,
creating
a
conflict.
article
xiv
may
be
found
on
page
2
of
petitioner's
brief,
also
on
page
13
of
an
appendix
to
the
brief
which
includes
the
treaty
as
a
whole.
article
xiv
befits
a
treaty
provision
states
simply
and
broadly
that
a
resident
of
the
united
kingdom
not
engaged
in
trade
or
business
in
the
united
states
shall
be
exempt
from
united
states
tax
on
gains
from
the
sale
or
exchange
of
capital
assets.
respondent
concedes
that
the
gains
here
involved
are
gains
from
the
sale
or
exchange
of
capital
assets
within
the
meaning
of
article
xiv.
and
that
all
the
beneficiaries
of
the
trust
are
residents
of
the
united
kingdom
within
the
meaning
of
article
xiv.
and
respondent
has
not
questioned
that
the
burden
of
this
tax
is
suffered
by
the
beneficiaries.
the
respondent
and
the
adverse
opinion
of
the
court
below
rest
on
the
ground
that
the
trust
under
our
domestic
law
is
the
taxpayer,
that
the
english
beneficiaries
are
not
the
taxpayers
and
therefore
this
exemption
in
this
case
is
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
treaty.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
there's
no
discretion
to
distribute
--
distribute,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
should've
stated
that
the
terms
of
the
trust
are
governed
by
connecticut
law
and
under
connecticut
law,
the
trustee
was
ret
--
acquired
to
accumulate
these
gains
as
part
of
the
corpus
of
the
trust,
so
there
was
no
discretion
whatsoever.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
no,
they
could
not.
it
belongs
to
the
remaindermen.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
the
burden
of
the
tax
if
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
white
is
that
--
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
--
it
depletes
the
gain
which
becomes
part
of
the
corpus
of
the
trust.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
that's
right
and
to
that
extent
--
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
--
it
depleted
the
interest
of
the
beneficiaries
in
that
gain.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
no,
mr.
--
no,
it
was
paid
out
of
the
corpus
that
with
--
the
capital
gain
was
added
to
corpus
but
it
was
reduced
by
the
amount
of
the
tax.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
well,
in
great
britain,
there
is
no
tax
whatsoever
on
gains
of
this
kind,
on
capital
gains.
they
regard
such
gains
as
corpus
and
not
income
or
profits.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
under
the
same
treaty
if
there
was
a
reverse
provision,
the
method
of
taxing
trusts
in
the
united
kingdom
are
somewhat
different
from
ours
because
they
have
a
surtax,
which
is
an
individual
tax
only
and
has
a
progression
in
it.
that
doesn't
ever
apply
to
a
trust
whether
the
income
is
distributed
or
accumulated
only
to
individuals,
but
there's
a
standard
tax
that
does
apply
to
corporations,
trusts
and
individuals
but
it
usually
doesn't
double
up.
if
the
standard
tax
has
been
paid
once
on
a
form
of
income
and
somebody
else
must
again
pay
it,
there's
a
credit
for
the
first
tax.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
well,
that's
a
question
of
fiduciary
accounting.
i
would
think
it
would
be.
they
regard
it
as
capital
gain.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
perhaps,
i
would
think
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
your
question.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
it
wouldn't
be
taxable
even
though
it
was
distributed
(voice
overlap).
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
no.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
oh,
a
receipt
of
that
by
a
united
states
taxpayer
under
our
law
would
be
considered
taxable.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
as
a
capital
gain.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
assuming
it
was
currently
distributed.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
it
had
to
be
added
to
the
corpus,
correct.
now,
respondent
takes
the
position
that
exempt
can
only
mean
exempt
from
the
duty
of
physically
paying
the
tax
to
the
treasury
and
it
cannot
mean
relieve
the
beneficiaries
or
that
somebody
else
from
the
burden
of
the
tax.
now,
i
would
like
later
to
refer
to
domestic
law.
there
is
precedent
under
domestic
law
in
applying
in
an
exemption
or
an
exclusion
or
even
a
tax
to
looking
at
the
status
of
the
beneficiaries,
including
the
remaindermen
rather
than
the
status
of
the
trust.
but
we
must
first
look
at
the
treaty
because
it
is
clear
that
the
meaning
of
the
word
exempt
must
be
determined
within
the
four
corners
of
the
treaty
and
that
if
it
means
what
petitioner
contends
the
treaty
has
then
controlling.
congress
has
stated
this
and
on
page
2
of
the
brief,
you
will
note
two
provisions
of
the
code
which
are
the
only
provisions
applicable
here
of
the
code
and
that's
the
income
of
any
kind
to
the
extent
required
by
any
treaty
obligation
of
the
united
states
shall
not
be
included
in
gross
income
and
shall
be
exempt
from
taxation
under
this
subtitle
meaning
the
provisions
of
our
income
tax
law.
and
further
the
--
no
provision
of
this
title
shall
apply
in
any
case
where
its
application
would
be
contrary
to
any
treaty
obligation
of
the
united
states
in
effect
from
the
date
of
enactment.
now,
article
xiv,
as
you
examine
it,
appears
as
a
one
way
street,
but
it
was
put
into
the
treaty
to
match
a
preexisting
exemption,
not
an
exempt
--
an
express
exemption
of
the
british,
but
an
exemption
that
existed
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
british
do
not
tax
gains
or
the
type
here
involved
because
they
regard
them
as
corpus
or
capital
and
not
income
or
profits.
this
is
true
where
the
gains
come
from
a
sale
of
property
owned
outright
or
held
in
trust.
the
exemption,
article
xiv
was
put
into
the
treaty
on
the
insistence
of
the
british,
not
the
united
states
and
in
so
doing,
they
rejected
language
concerning
capital
gains
provisions
that
existed
in
all
prior
treaties
at
which
they
were
treated.
the
language
they
rejected
would've
provided
that
the
gains
would
be
exempt
only
if
derived
from
property
sold
by
a
british
resident.
this
language
was
not
accepted.
as
a
result
of
the
change
in
language
and
the
broader
language
used,
the
respondent
has
to
concede
in
this
case
that
when
there's
a
gain
derived
from
property
sold
by
an
american
trustee
is
covered
under
the
treaty,
but
he
qualifies
that
by
saying,
“if
it's
currently
distributed,
not
if
it's
retained
for
future
distribution.”
he
states
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there's
no
--
once
you
admit
that
a
gain
from
property
sold
by
an
american
trust
is
within
the
treaty
exemption,
whatever
our
own
law
might
be,
within
the
treaty
exemption,
it
shouldn't
make
any
difference
at
all
where
the
gain
is
lodged
between
the
date
of
receipt
and
the
date
of
distribution.
and
it's
particularly
irrational
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
only
reason
the
gains
in
this
case
are
retained
in
the
trust
at
all
is
because
they're
regarded
by
connecticut
law
as
corpus
and
not
income,
which
agrees
with
the
british
principle.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
if
the
beneficiaries
were
engaged
in
trade
or
business
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
any
exemption.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
the
fact
that
the
trust
is
here
does
not
mean
that
they're
engaged
in
trade
or
business,
and
in
this
case
respondent
doesn't
make
that
claim.
respondent
has
not
claimed,
in
fact
it's
agreed
that
the
beneficiaries
qualify
as
residents
of
the
united
kingdom
not
engaged
to
trade
or
business
in
united
states.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
no,
nor
does
it
make
the
trust
engaged
in
trade
or
business.
this
is
admittedly
passive
income,
not
income
derived
from
the
act
of
trade
or
business
--
of
a
trade
or
business
by
the
trust
or
by
the
beneficiary.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
no,
because
that's
what
this
particular
treaty
is
about.
this
treaty,
more
than
any
other
treaty
and
unlike
most
treaties
looks
to
the
economic
burden
of
the
tax
rather
than
the
legal
incident
of
the
taxpayer
or
rather
than
to
the
domestic
concept
of
a
technical
taxpayer
and
this
was
done
on
the
insistence
of
the
british.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
[inaudible]
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
just
as
we
are
exempt
from
them.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
no,
the
exception
--
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
the
exception
is
only
--
only
relates
to
a
british
resident
who
was
engaged
in
trade
or
business
in
the
united
states
which
tends
to
bring
them
within
our
jurisdiction
and
make
them
more
like
a
resident.
he
can
be
engaged
in
trade
or
business
in
the
united
kingdom
and
he's
perfectly
alright.
but
if
he's
engaged
in
trade
or
business
over
here,
he
is
without
the
scope
of
this
exemption.
this
exemption
is
for
investment
income
not
for
business
income.
you
might
say
it
is
further
irrational
to
make
a
distinction
between
distributed
and
undistributed
gains
when
it
is
realized
in
either
case,
the
sale
is
made
by
the
trustee
and
no
one
else.
that
neither
the
case,
the
trustee
acts
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
only,
the
trustee
holds
legal
title
for
the
property
sold.
the
beneficiary
only
has
equitable
ownership
and
the
beneficiary
in
either
case
bears
the
burden
of
a
tax.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
no,
sir.
no,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
under
our
all
law,
we
recognize
a
corporation
even
though
it's
a
holding
company
and
even
though
it's
a
personal
holding
company
unless
it's
a
sham.
and
as
a
juridical
person,
separate
entity
and
the
treaty
so
recognizes,
the
treaty
contains
definitions
which
i
hope
to
get
to
later
which
includes
corporations
as
entities
or
juridical
persons.
and
the
shareholder
doesn't
have
the
same
kind
of
interest
in
the
underlying
corporate
property
as
the
beneficiary
does
of
a
trust.
now,
the
whole
question
here
is
whether
article
xiv
released
these
beneficiaries
of
the
burden
of
the
tax
when
admittedly
the
beneficiaries
are
not
the
taxpayers.
i
think
the
objectives
of
this
treaty
are
compelling
in
answering
that
question.
the
british
were
hard
bargainers.
we
started
on
negotiations
on
the
preliminary
basis
with
the
british
back
in
1937,
got
three
other
treaties
in
the
meantime
with
others,
france,
sweden
and
canada.
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
long
difficult
time
in
getting
a
treaty
with
the
british
was
because
we
were
very
interested
in
the
problem
of
fiscal
evasion,
exchange
of
information
for
reciprocal
enforcement.
and
the
british
had
a
long
standing
policy
of
fiscal
secrecy
and
they
finally
only
agreed
to
exchange
of
information
if
we
would
agree
with
--
so
insofar
as
possible
to
put
our
two
laws
within
the
treaty
on
a
reciprocal
basis.
we
were
also
particularly
interested
in
eliminating
mere
double
taxation
by
the
use
of
mutual
tax
credits.
the
british
at
first
didn't
like
the
idea
of
tax
credits
but
agreed
to
it
if
we
would
also
agree
to,
particularly
for
investment
income,
mutual
exemptions
at
the
source.
and
under
this
treaty,
income
is
exempt
even
though
as
a
result,
is
not
taxed
in
either
country
at
all,
insofar
as
the
british
residents
are
concerned.
now
--
and
trying
to
put
the
two
laws
on
a
reciprocal
basis,
the
british
focused
on
the
burden
of
the
tax
and
not
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax.
let
me
try
to
give
two
simple
examples.
article
vi
of
the
treaty
relates
to
dividends
and
practically
every
other
treaty,
all
we
do
is
fix
equal
withholding
rates
on
dividends
bearing
from
one
country
to
the
other
country,
not
so
with
the
british
convention.
the
british
convention
has
a
15%
withholding
rate
of
dividends
going
in
the
united
kingdom
from
here
and
the
united
kingdom
dividend
is
coming
over
to
the
united
states
are
merely
exempted
from
the
british
surtax
on
individuals.
because
the
british
weren't
looking
at
just
the
--
who
was
the
taxpayer,
the
dividend
recipient.
they
were
looking
at
the
underlying
burden
of
the
tax
including
the
corporate
tax.
now,
at
that
time
the
british
standard
tax
on
corporations
was
50%,
there
was
an
additional
defense
contributions
tax
of
55%
or
5%,
55%
at
all
--
in
all
and
our
corporate
tax
was
40%
yet
on
the
15%
withholding,
that's
55%.
so
the
british
arranged
for
this
even
though
the
actual
recipients
didn't
look
on
the
surface
as
if
they
were
being
treated
on
the
same
basis.
also
in
accepting
the
credit
for
taxes,
long
time
ago
this
court,
not
very
long
time
ago,
had
held
that
a
recipient
was
the
united
states
taxpayer.
the
dividend
from
a
british
corporation
couldn't
take
as
a
credit
under
our
credit
tax
laws,
the
credit
that
the
british
corporation
paid
to
the
british
treasury,
the
tax
that
the
british
corporation
paid
because
that
dividend
recipient
was
not
the
taxpayer.
the
british
corporation
was
the
taxpayer.
but
the
british
insisted
that
under
the
treaty
when
a
u.s.
resident
receives
a
dividend
from
a
british
corporation,
he
is
entitled
to
use
the
tax
credit,
the
british
standard
tax
against
our
tax
and
the
reverse
is
equally
true.
the
british
residents
under
the
treaty
are
allowed
to
take
the
corporate
tax
paid
here
by
the
united
states
corporation
as
his
own
credit
against
the
income
tax
and
written
from
that
income.
this
is
a
very
large
difference
and
again,
they're
looking
at
the
burden
of
the
tax.
now,
they
didn't
have
any
provision
like
that
for
trust
income
because
foreign
tax
credits
flow
through
a
trust
anyway
and
they
had
to
make
that
specific
exception
if
they
were
going
to
do
it
at
the
corporate
level
because
corporations
are
recognized
in
the
treaty
as
a
juridical
person,
as
a
separate
entity.
there
was
a
language
rejected
by
the
british
even
aside
from
this
language
in
the
old
capital
gain
provisions
that
required
that
the
foreign
resident
himself
make
the
sale.
one
language
is
called
--
one
provision
that
was
rejected
is
the
saving
clause
which
would
have
given
the
united
states
the
power,
under
this
treaty
if
that
saving
clause
had
gone
in,
to
tax
this
trust
even
though
the
united
states
agreed
and
conceded
that
article
xiv,
otherwise
applied
to
these
retained
gains.
the
saving
clause
states
in
effect
in
the
other
treaties
and
it's
always
coupled
with
a
credit,
so
it
never
affects
the
credit
that
states
that
the
united
states
reserved
as
a
right
to
tax
its
own
residents,
its
own
citizens
as
if
--
as
though
this
treaty
had
not
come
into
effect
and
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
the
treaty
to
the
contrary.
whenever
that
kind
of
a
clause
is
combined
with
a
credit,
a
reciprocal
credit
provision,
all
it
will
permit
is
the
avoidance
of
double
taxation.
it
will
never
permit
the
mutual
reciprocity
that
the
british
insisted
on
in
this
convention.
now,
respondent
tries
to
read
that
rejected
saving
clause
back
into
the
treaty
and
to
do
that
he
relies
on
the
definition
of
a
resident
of
the
united
kingdom.
that
definition
is
found
in
the
appendix
on
page
3
and
it
provides
in
effect
that
a
resident
of
the
united
kingdom
is
any
person
other
than
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
other
than
the
united
states
corporation,
who
is
a
resident
in
the
united
kingdom
for
purposes
of
united
kingdom
tax
and
not
a
resident
in
the
united
states
for
purposes
of
united
states
tax.
but
it
is
conceded
that
these
beneficiaries
qualify
under
this
definition
as
residents.
it's
true
that
the
trust
is
a
person
and
it's
true
that
the
trust
is
a
resident
here,
but
i
would
like
to
draw
the
attention
of
this
court
to
helvering
v.
hutchings
on
page
31
of
our
brief,
which
contains
in
it
the
commissioner's
argument
which
is
exactly
like
the
argument
of
respondent
here,
that
when
a
--
where
a
person
appears
that
that
word
will
control
in
this
kind
of
an
issue.
in
the
hutchings'
case
there
was
a
gift
tax
exemption
for
any
gift
to
each
person,
the
donor
made
a
gift
to
a
trust,
his
seven
children
were
beneficiaries
of
the
trust.
the
commissioner
argued
since
a
trust
is
a
person,
which
is
the
argument
here,
he
only
gets
one
gift
tax
exemption.
and
this
court
said,
“no,
the
word
person
also
includes
individuals,
including
the
beneficiaries,
he
gets
seven
gift
tax
exclusions.”
finally,
respondent
finds
that
--
the
treaty
states
that
if
a
term
is
not
otherwise
defined
in
the
treaty
unless
the
context
of
the
treaty
requires
that
it
must
be
determined
under
the
laws
of
this
country
when
it's
dealing
with
our
taxes.
but
the
term
trust
is
not
a
term
of
the
treaty
and
the
term
exempt
has
been
found
in
our
domestic
laws
to
apply
to
a
remaindermen
of
a
trust
in
case
law
even
before
congress
did
the
same
thing.
it
should
be
construed
in
light
of
the
purpose
of
article
xiv,
which
is
reciprocity
in
terms
of
the
economic
burden
of
the
tax.
this
was
found
by
american
trust
company
v.
smyth
in
the
ninth
circuit.
american
trust
company
v.
smyth
achieves
reciprocity,
the
court
below
does
not
and
i
urge
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
under
the
regulations?
the
regulations,
mr.
justice
harlan,
are
quite
meaningless
to
me
because
they
say
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
gains
in
a
trust,
that
they
will
be
within
the
scope
of
the
convention
if
they
are
part
of
the
distributive
share
of
the
trust,
if
the
british
recipient
is
taxable
in
the
united
kingdom
on
that
income.
that
same
language
applies
to
other
provisions
in
the
treaty
quite
likely
because
the
treaty
requires
that
and
that
is
good
language
if
the
whole
purpose
of
this
was
merely
to
avoid
double
tax.
so
that
we
would
only
tax
it
so
long
as
the
british
didn't
and
we'd
stop
taxing
it
if
the
british
did,
but
that's
not
the
purpose
of
article
xiv
and
the
treasury
admits
that.
also
distributive
share
is
an
absolutely
meaningless
term.
it
applies
in
our
code
for
partnership
income
and
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it's
currently
distributed
or
whether
the
income
is
accumulated
for
the
partner,
he
still
pays
a
tax
on
it
when
it's
a
distributive
share.
we're
dealing
with
entirely
different
terms
and
the
statute
on
trust.
furthermore,
this
regulation
also
borrows
from
the
earlier
treaty
and
say
--
says
somewhat
inconsistently
with
the
part
i've
just
mentioned
that
the
gains
must
be
derived
from
the
sale
by
a
british
resident
of
the
property,
which
is
relied
on
heavily
by
respondent
in
his
brief,
where
he
says,
“this
can't
apply
when
the
sales
are
derived
from
gains
sold
by
someone
for
someone
else.”
i
do
not
think
that
these
regulations
are
helpful
at
all.
thank
you.
mr.
david
a.
lindsay
may
it
again
please
the
court.
the
reciprocity
in
this
convention
was
the
reciprocity
the
british
requested,
so
that
they
would
be
treated
on
income
from
the
united
states
in
the
same
way
with
respect
to
exemptions
that
our
residents
are
treated
on
receiving
the
same
form
of
so-called
income
from
the
united
kingdom
and
section
2
of
our
main
brief
spells
that
out
in
detail.
there
is
no
administrative
problem
with
fixed
beneficiaries.
this
is
the
first
time
this
problem
has
been
mentioned.
it
has
not
been
mentioned
in
the
briefs
or
the
court
below,
but
we
have
the
same
problem
exactly
when
we're
imposing
taxes
or
relieving
people
from
taxes
in
this
country,
where
mixed
beneficiaries,
the
capital
gains
attributable
to
the
gains,
belonging
to
the
british
beneficiaries
would
be
exempted.
only
that
part
and
it's
done
on
an
actuarial
basis
in
an
actuarial
rules
in
our
statutes
and
regulations
so
that
each
beneficiary
gets
an
exemption
if
he's
british
only
in
accordance
looking
at
the
entire
fund
of
his
actuarial
interest
in
that
fund.
this
is
not
a
problem.
now,
the
burden
theory
is
not
inconsistent
with
our
way
of
taxing
trusts
in
this
country.
while
there
has
been
a
rejection
in
other
cases
involving
corporations
cost
plus
contractors,
etcetera,
on
a
rejection
of
the
economic
burden
test
for
the
use
of
the
word
“exempted”
has
not
been
when
the
person
that
is
intended
to
be
exempt
is
the
beneficiary
or
the
remaindermen
and
the
so-called
taxpayer
is
a
trust.
and
i
cite
letter
of
this
doctrine
on
page
34
of
our
main
brief
and
other
cases
flowing
from
that
on
pages
4
and
5
of
our
reply
brief.
this
is
a
one
exception,
they
don't
use
the
word
economic
burden
but
they
come
out
with
the
same
result.
the
idea
of
the
purpose
of
our
domestic
rules
for
taxing
trust
is
to
ensure
that
taxable
income
and
a
trust
is
taxed
only
once
either
to
the
trust
or
to
the
beneficiary.
it
was
never
designed
to
create
a
tax
on
income
intended
to
be
exempt.
it
doesn't
change
the
character
of
the
income
screen
through
it,
the
way
a
corporation
does.
it
doesn't
tax
the
income
twice
the
way
a
corporate
does.
it's
entirely
different
and
was
never
used
to
destroy
an
obvious
exemption
intended
for
a
beneficiary
and
on
the
hostility,
supposedly
against
capital
gains
that
related
only
as
the
brief
shows
--
the
reply
brief
to
refugees
physically
present
in
the
united
states
in
making
gains
on
the
stock
exchange.
and
that's
why
that
culminated
the
new
legislation
to
tax
non-resident
aliens
on
capital
gains
when
they
were
physically
present.
our
--
that
stated
to
have
no
parallel
with
the
british
whatsoever
and
while
our
own
grantor
here
had
visited
the
united
states
[inaudible]
in
1958,
he
is
not
the
target
of
that
legislation.
he
is
a
historic
building
secretary
of
the
national
trust
in
the
united
kingdom.
i
thank
the
court.
