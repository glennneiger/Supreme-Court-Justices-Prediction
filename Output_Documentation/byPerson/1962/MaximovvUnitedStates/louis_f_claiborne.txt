mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
we
are
dealing
with
an
american
trust
in
every
sense.
the
trust
created
under
the
laws
of
connecticut
which
is
a
resident
in
the
united
states,
the
corpus
of
the
trust
is
physically
located
in
the
united
states.
as
a
matter
of
american
law,
it
is
the
taxpayer
very
clearly
on
the
gains
involved
in
this
controversy.
these
gains
were
as
a
matter
of
state
law
retained
in
the
trust
and
were
therefore
taxable
to
the
trust
as
a
matter
of
american
law.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
would
have
been
reported
by
the
trust
that
they
would
--
the
beneficiaries
who
had
received
them
would
not
have
owed
any
tax
on
them
because
they
were
non-resident
aliens
who
with
respect
to
capital
gains
had
no
temporary
presence
in
the
united
states.
they
would
have
been
further
exempted
if
necessary
under
article
xiv
of
this
treaty.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
effect,
it's
exempted
because
it
distributes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
correct.
he
obtained
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
the
deduction
which
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
you
take
it
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
take
it
out.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
think
the
citizenship
and
residents
of
the
trustee
would
be
relevant
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
claim
an
english
trust
with
a
trust
--
american
trustee
and
property
physically
located
in
connecticut.
i
don't
know
how
that
could
qualify
as
a
british
trust
and
from
my
point
view
of
american
tax
law
which
governs
even
under
the
treaty
as
to
the
imposition
of
american
tax
we
would
deem
that
trust
a
domestic
trust
and
that
being
true,
the
trust
would
not
be
subject
to
the
exemption
of
article
xiv.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
perhaps
they
could
have.
the
only
question
here
therefore
is
whether
this
rule
of
american
law
which
would
otherwise
clearly
apply
to
the
gains
realized
by
this
trust
and
retained
by
this
trust
is
affected
by
our
treaty
with
great
britain.
at
first
blush
it
would
seem
strange
that
a
convention
on
our
part
with
great
britain
would
affect
our
own
taxation
of
an
entity
that
we
recognize
as
a
separate
person,
taxpayer
in
the
unites
states.
that
is
the
sort
of
relationship
with
which
treaties
normally
do
not
deal,
an
international
treaty.
but
getting
to
the
actual
language
of
article
xiv,
we
notice
that
it
exempts
only
residents
of
the
united
kingdom
and
only
those
not
engaged
in
trade
or
business
in
the
united
states,
but
as
mr.
lindsay
correctly
said,
we
make
no
allegation
regarding
engaging
in
trade
or
business
here.
now
the
phrase,
“residents
of
the
united
kingdom”
is
further
defined
in
the
treaty
itself
in
article
ii
(1)
(g)
which
appears
on
page
3,
i
believe
of
the
petitioner's
appendix,
yes
page
3.
we
noticed
that
excluded
from
the
definition
of
residents
of
the
united
kingdom
are
first,
citizens
of
the
united
states.
american
citizens
though
resident
in
great
britain
are
not
considered
residents
of
the
united
kingdom
for
the
purpose
of
this
provision.
those
who,
though
residents
of
the
united
kingdom
from
their
point
of
view
or
from
our
point
of
view,
residents
to
the
united
states
are
also
not
covered
by
this
provision
of
the
treaty.
the
only
categories
covered
by
article
xiv
are
those
who
are
solely
residents
of
the
united
kingdom
and
as
to
whom
we
claim
no
residence
qualification.
clearly,
the
domestic
trust
involved
here
doesn't
qualify
under
those
definitions
and
there's
no
real
claim
that
it
would.
that
--
if
--
nor
does
the
trustee,
he
being
an
american
citizen
in
an
american
resident,
very
clearly.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
quite
so,
the
beneficiaries
clearly
as
british
subjects
and
british
residents
do
qualify.
but
it
is
difficult
to
see
on
the
face
of
the
provision
how
this
exemption
is
intended
to
work
in
favor
of
someone
who
is
not
the
taxpayer,
who
does
not
owe
the
tax,
who
has
no
liability
with
respect
to
the
tax.
the
language
of
the
provision
itself
would
seem
to
say,
we
are
exempting
he
who
owes
the
tax,
not
we
are
exempting
he
who
may
one
day
suffer
the
ultimate
economic
burden
of
the
tax,
but
beyond
article
xiv,
there
are
other
indications
that
the
taxpayer
himself
is
the
one
we're
concerned
with.
other
indications
in
the
text
of
the
treaty
itself
referring
again
to
article
ii
(1)
(g)
on
page
3
of
the
petitioner's
appendix.
we
notice
that
that
article
finds
the
term
resident
of
the
united
kingdom
as
any
person
who
is
a
resident
of
the
united
kingdom
for
tax
purposes
and
not
a
resident
of
united
states
for
tax
purposes.
any
person
seems
to
be
a
deliberately
broad
way,
seems
to
be
intended
to
include
entities
beyond
mere
corporations
and
natural
persons.
we
don't
have
to
guess
about
it,
however,
because
the
treaty
itself
tells
us
that
whenever
a
term
is
undefined,
we
should
resort
to
the
law
of
the
taxing
government.
that
provision
directing
us
to
resort
to
the
law
of
the
taxing
government
is
article
ii
(3),
which
is
on
page
5
of
the
petitioner's
appendix.
of
course,
as
a
matter
of
american
law,
a
trust
is
a
person
and
that
much
seems
to
be
conceded.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
it
doesn't
make
much
difference
whether
trusts
are
viewed
by
the
treaty
as
residents
or
as
persons
because
if
they
are
not,
the
result
must
be
that
the
trust,
that
the
article
looks
only
to
the
income
retained
by
natural
persons.
that
might
mean
that
in
a
trust
situation
they
look
to
the
trustee
which
is
the
english
custom.
since
this
is
a
treaty
with
great
britain,
we
might
assume
that
that
is
what
was
intended.
if
we
do
that
of
course,
again,
we
find
the
resident
of
the
united
states.
it
may
even
be
however,
that
the
treaty
does
not
intend
to
deal
at
all
with
the
income
retained
by
trust.
that
was
simply
a
problem
not
thought
to
be
solved
by
this
treaty.
in
fact,
the
legislative
history
of
the
ratification
of
the
treaty
tends
to
show
that
the
trust
problem
was
never
contemplated.
there
is
no
indication
of
any
specific
or
expressed
adversion
to
this
problem.
but
there's
another
indication
in
the
language
of
the
treaty
that
we
should
look
to
american
law
in
determining
who
is
exempted.
again,
looking
at
article
ii
(1)
(g)
on
page
three
of
the
petitioner's
appendix,
we
notice
that
it's
not
just
any
person
who
meets
the
qualifications
who
is
exempted
but
it's
any
person
not
resident
in
the
united
states
for
the
purposes
of
united
states
tax.
in
other
words,
there's
certainly
an
implication
that
those
who
are
persons
is
a
question
to
be
determined
by
reference
to
united
states
tax
law,
if
that
is
true
then
clearly
we
look
to
the
taxpayer,
the
trust
under
domestic
law
is
the
taxpayer.

--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
of
the
petitioner's
appendix,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now,
we're
told
that
we
are
being
too
literal
with
the
language
of
this
treaty
and
that
we
must
look
to
the
broad
purpose
of
the
convention.
and
we
are
given
an
economic
burden
argument.
it's
very
difficult
to
sustain
the
economic
burden
argument
in
view
of
its
rejection
under
our
own
laws
and
the
lack
of
any
indication
in
the
ratification
of
the
treaty
in
this
country
that
anyone
imagined
that
we
were
changing
our
whole
concept
toward
the
taxation
of
income
that
we
were
no
longer
looking
to
the
recipient,
the
immediate
recipient,
but
that
we
were
suddenly
turning
to
a
different
notion
and
approaching
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
ultimate
economic
burden.
but
outside
of
that,
there
would
be
some
practical
problems
involved
if
we
did
use
or
attempted
to
use
any
economic
burden
approach.
we
have
--
only
to
visualize
the
situation
where
the
beneficiaries
where
some
of
them
residents
of
the
united
kingdom
and
others
residents
of
the
united
states.
that
might
be
easy
to
allocate
if
you
had
only
two
beneficiaries
both
be
a
remaindermen
but
if
you
have
some
who
are
contingent
beneficiaries,
some
who
are
principal
beneficiaries,
some
who
are
merely
income
beneficiaries,
it
becomes
an
impossible
problem
to
determine
which
part
of
the
trust
income
is
allocable
to
which
ultimately
in
terms
of
ultimate
economic
burden.
it
easy
enough
to
tell
immediately
which
is
the
policy
of
the
tax
law
and
presumably
a
practical
policy
in
the
tax
law.
all
of
mr.
lindsay's
argument
for
the
economic
burden
test
applies
equally
to
our
own
revenue
laws.
and
it
was
made
and
it
has
been
rejected
long
ago
by
this
court
and
by
the
congress.
it
has
no
more
persuasive
force
now
with
respect
to
this
treaty
than
it
did
then
with
respect
to
our
own
approach
to
the
taxation
of
income.
and
also
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
certain
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
certainly,
justice
stewart
but
it's
hard
to
read
that
revolution
in
approach
without
some
indication
in
the
legislative
history,
without
some
express
provision
in
the
treaty.
it's
not
worthy
that
when
the
treaty
did
intend
to
change
our
own
law
they
were
very
explicit
about
it.
mr.
lindsay
pointed
out
article
vi
and
article
xiii
which
in
effect
at
least
to
a
limited
extent
overruled
the
biddle
case
in
this
court.
it
was
thought
necessary
to
do
so
expressly,
and
that
was
the
situation
where
in
one
sense
an
economic
burden
test
was
accepted,
but
we
certainly
cannot
assume
that
it
was
intended
to
go
beyond
the
express
provisions
in
the
treaty
when
they
thought
it
was
necessary,
they
did
so
expressly,
we
cannot
assume
they
meant
to
go
further.
now,
much
is
said
about
the
purpose
of
article
xiv
being
to
achieve
reciprocal
equality.
i've
never
been
quite
sure
what
was
intended
by
that.
on
its
face,
the
provision
clearly
is
not
reciprocal.
it
exempts
only
british
residents.
it
does
not
exempt
american
residents.
it
said
that
the
reason
why
it
only
exempts
british
residents
is
because
the
british
don't
tax
capital
gains.
so
there
was
no
need
to
exempt
american
residents,
the
residents
in
the
united
states.
this
is
not
a
full
answer
as
the
court
below
pointed
out
they
are
instances
in
which
the
british
do
tax
capital
gains.
furthermore,
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
british
never
would
in
the
future
tax
capital
gains.
in
fact,
in
1962,
they
did
begin
a
serious
taxation
of
capital
gains.
if
the
petitioner's
argument
were
to
be
accepted,
article
xiv
which
presumably
had
to
be
scrapped
on
the
theory
that
conditions
have
changed
since
it
was
enacted
and
therefore
--
since
the
contemplation
of
the
parties
was
no
longer
realized
that
the
provision
could
not
be
applied.
but
in
any
event,
i
don't
quite
see
where
they
pinpoint
the
equality
they're
talking
about.
if
it's
inequality
between
all
residents
of
the
united
kingdom
on
the
one
hand
and
all
residents
of
the
united
states
on
the
other
hand,
the
treaty
clearly
doesn't
achieve
this
because
american
residents
of
the
united
kingdom
are
not
exempted
and
for
that
matter,
other
residents
of
the
united
kingdom
who
have
a
permanent
establishment
in
the
united
states
are
not
exempted.
there's
no
similar
provision
with
respect
to
the
english
tax.
perhaps,
they're
talking
about
inequality
between
the
british
residents
of
the
united
kingdom
and
the
american
residents
of
the
united
states,
a
strange
thing
for
a
treaty
to
be
concerned
about,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
provision
applies
to
non-british
residents
of
the
united
kingdom
as
well
as
british
residents
but
not
to
american
residents
of
the
united
kingdom.
now
finally,
it
might
be
thought
that
the
equality
sought
to
be
achieved
is
between
british
and
non-british
residents
of
the
united
kingdom.
but
here
again
is
an
exception
because
american,
non-british
residents
of
the
united
kingdom
are
not
covered
by
the
treaty.
the
british
scheme
of
taxation
is
to
tax
non-residents
whether
british
or
not,
whether
british
subjects
or
not,
only
on
their
british
source
income.
they
make
no
distinction
with
respect
to
nationality,
any
distinction
made
in
the
treaty
with
respect
to
american
nationality
defeats
the
equality.
it
does
not
promote
it.
the
truth
of
the
matter
i
think
is,
i
think
mr.
lindsay
touched
on
this,
is
that
article
xiv
was
a
concession
we
made
to
the
british
government
and
as
he
said,
the
british
were
most
insistent
to
obtain
it.
we
agreed
--
the
british
were
insistent
on
obtaining
it
presumably
because
they
wanted
to
exempt
their
own
residents,
except
american
residents
whom
we
insisted
on
continuing
tax,
and
because
they
wanted
to
encourage
others
to
come
to
the
united
kingdom
without
being
subjected
to
american
tax.
we
conceded
because
actually
there
was
very
little
change
from
our
then
existing
tax
law
with
respect
to
the
gains
of
non-resident
aliens.
the
only
difference
was
that
we
now
exempted
those
who
--
though
engaged
in
trade
or
business
in
this
country
did
not
have
a
permanent
establishment
here.
while
under
the
then
existing
law,
we
taxed
all
those
who
engaged
a
trade
or
business
here
regardless
of
whether
they
have
permanent
establishment
here.
since
that
time,
we
have
begun
taxing,
and
since
1950,
we
began
taxing
those
who
were
temporarily
present
here
even
though
not
engaged
in
trade
or
business.
but
at
that
time,
the
argument
was
this
doesn't
seriously
change
the
law.
this
is
our
own
argument
to
our
own
impediment.
also,
we've
done
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
three
other
countries,
sweden
and
canada
or
in
france
and
we
assured
the
senate
that
this
provision
went
no
further.
so
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
well,
not
to
my
knowledge
of
this,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct.
now
finally,
our
reason
for
making
this
concession
was
that
as
practical
matter,
we'd
experience
big
difficulty
in
collecting
this
tax
anyway,
therefore,
we
were
giving
up
very
little
when
we
agreed
to
extend
the
exemption
a
little
bit
further
than
it's
usually
be
done
under
our
laws.
and
while
we're
talking
about
equality,
there
might
be
some
relevance
to
pointing
out
that
if
we
were
to
exempt
the
capital
gains
from
british
residents,
beneficiaries
of
american
trust
even
though
they
never
received
the
income,
we
are
differentiating
or
discriminating
against
all
the
other
nations
with
whom
we
have
tax
treaties
because
in
those
instances
we
do
not
grant
any
exemption
unless
they
actually
received
the
funds.
our
position
is
that
the
same
rule
applies
with
respect
to
the
british
treaty.
as
i
said,
the
legislative
history
in
this
instance
while
voluminous
is
not
very
enlightening.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
bears
on
the
question
of
the
taxation
under
capital
gains
of
trust,
but
there
is
at
least
this
much
which
certainly
militates
against
any
broad
reading
of
article
xiv.
it
is
the
climate
of
hostility,
evident
throughout
the
hearings,
evident
in
the
re-committal
of
the
treaty
after
an
initial
favorable
report
in
the
senate
and
hostility
toward
any
extension
of
the
exemption
for
non-resident
aliens.
there
is
also
the
assurance
given
that
this
treaty
went
no
further
than
previous
treaties.
the
argument
was
that
precedent
should
be
followed
and
that
very
little
actual
harm
would
be
done.
but
had
it
been
thought
that
what
the
petitioner
contends
for
was
contemplated
by
article
xiv
certainly,
we
would
expect
to
find
some
indication
of
resistance
at
least
that
there
is
no
resistance
directed
to
this
particular
problem.
now
finally,
with
respect
to
the
regulations,
we
frankly
confess
that
the
regulations
are
imperfect.
the
explanation
for
the
addition
of
the
phrase,
“if
subject
to
tax
in
the
united
kingdom”
is
that
that
provision
is
appropriate
to
the
other
items
of
income
enumerated.
it
is
not
appropriate
with
respect
to
capital
gains
and
it
was
obviously
an
inadvertence
to
make
it
seem
applicable
to
all
capital
gain
income.
the
phrase
“distributive
share”
is
perhaps
not
quite
as
clear
as
distributable
share
but
there
seems
to
be
no
point
in
trying
to
prove
that
distributive
share
clearly
intends
the
amount
distributed
or
distributable
to
the
beneficiary.
for
these
reasons,
we
think
it's
clear
that
the
text
of
the
treaty
which
does
not
grant
an
exemption
in
this
case,
should
not
be
extended
and
the
judgment
below
should
be
asserted.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
some
--
but
we
don't
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
do
rely
on
the
regulation
in
that
it
shows
a
contemporary
interpretation.
it
has
not
been
objected
to.
it
apparently
was
done
with
the
consent
of
the
british
government
and
it
certainly
indicates
they
--
our
reading
of
the
provision
is
correct.
the
--
i
might
note
that
the
inaccuracy
in
the
regulation
does
not
help
the
petitioner
in
any
way.
it
denies
an
exemption
in
a
case
where
we
would
concede
that
it
should
grant
on
it.
