justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
this
i
gather
that
aspect
of
primary
jurisdiction
which
relies
principally
upon
the
so-called
expertise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
may
i
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
marquis,
what
are
the
provisions
for
review
of
the
administrative
determination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
anticipate
your
argument
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
could
this
be
done
then
under
this
new
arrangement
in
the
condemnation
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
probably
would
be
the
same
judge
in
any
way,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
understand
this
mr.
marquis,
because
i
understand
you
to
say
that
this
question
of
the
validity
of
a
claim,
that
it
may
be
valid
only
if
it
appears
that
there
was
a
transfer
by
the
united
states
of
title
that
claimant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
some
interest
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
an
interest,
whatever.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
some
vested
right
in
something
which
belongs
to
the
united
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
marquis,
sorry
to
bother
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
you
started
this
whole
thing
looking
to
condemn
--
i
understand
for
a
dam,
wasn't
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
something
like
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
how
much
have
been
--
of
all
--
you
knew
when
you
started
that
--
when
you
needed
that
3000
acres
for
the
dam
site
or
whatever
it
was,
you
knew
the
area
and
you
knew
that
there
were
doubtless
number
of
outstanding
mining
claims,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
did
you
know
much
about
those
claims
that
you
have
to
wait
till
they
can
--
until
they
were
asserted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
when
you
filed
your
condemnation
action
was
it
in
that
action
that
this
required
--
these
claimants
to
assert
their
claims,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
do
they
do
this
before
you
start
your
condemnation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to.
before
the
condemnation
action
is
started
then
there
has
to
have
been
a
lot
of
work
done.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
dig
these
claims
up,
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
--
in
other
words,
suppose
this
thing
is
in
universal
camera,
will
you
allow
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
something
like
that
on
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
since
october,
i
gather,
the
scope
of
review
hasn't
been
enlarged,
it's
only
that
other
business
ventures
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
now
they
had
obtained
comparable
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
applications,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
justified
i
gather
because
this
is
--
these
are
claims
against
property
of
the
united
states,
is
that
your
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
(inaudible)
--
are
the
proceedings
often
in
real
adversary
proceedings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
those
proceedings,
as
i
understand
it,
sought
the
issuance
of
a
patent,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
i
mean
that's
what
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
sought.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you've
--
and
you
have
said,
i
think,
that
you
concede
that
the
bureau
has
jurisdiction
of
that
kind
of
proceeding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
they
have
not
moved,
you
say
because
the
government
has
it
moot?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
deny
that
they
have
jurisdiction
to
initiate
a
contest
proceeding
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
the
validity
of
unpatented
lands,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wish
you
would
because
i
don't
quite
understand,
if
i
may
just
state
what
bothers
me,
mr.
gilmore.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
it
--
what
you
said
to
mr.
justice
harlan
was
the
mistake
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
saying
that
you'd
made
this
concession
before
that
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
that
rule
of
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
gilmore,
you
still
have
to
prove
that
something
was
taken,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
you
have
to
prove
that
your
property
was
taken.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
the
chief
justice
is
asking,
how
are
you
in
any
different
now
in
the
district
court
on
truth
then
you
would
be
before
the
bureau?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
have
to
prove
something
more
than
that
before
the
bureau?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
isn't
the
question,
is
it?
it
is
whether
something
was
taken.
it's
not
what
the
value
of
what
was
taken.
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
gather
--
i
gather
the
government
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
doesn't
concede
that
anything
was
taken.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose,
mr.
gilmore
that
you're
right
that
on
judicial
review
whether
or
not
that
rule
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
under
the
circumstances
that
bother
you
would
be
before
the
district
court,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
must
say
to
me
it
sounds
pretty
arbitrary
and
capricious
to
flood
you
with
600
feet
of
water.
and
then
say
in
consequence
you
can't
prove
a
case,
i
can't
read
the
view
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
hope
not.
