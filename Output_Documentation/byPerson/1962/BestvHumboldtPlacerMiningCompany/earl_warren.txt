is
the
status
of
those
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
press
on
their
view?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
were
these
proceedings
first
started,
that
--
with
relation
to
the
condemnation
proceedings?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at,
mr.
gilmore
was
when
was
your
proceeding
before
the
bureau
of
land
management
started?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long?
chief
justice
earl

before

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.

can
you
tell
me
approximately
when
these
claims
were
staked
out
and
when
they
were
filed
in
the
county
clerk's
office?
chief
justice
earl
warren
those
that
are
involved
in
this
particular
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gilmore,
one
of
--
this
is
a
thing
that's
bothering
me.
suppose
you
had
prevailed
--
suppose
you
had
a
hearing
before
the
land
management
division
or
on
your
proceedings
that
you
initiated
in
1957
and
the
government
would
just
--
decided
against
you.
would
you
be
in
any
different
position
then
than
you
would
be
in
this
case
if
the
land
management
division
now
decides
against
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course,
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
can't
wipe
time
out
but
it
means
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
so
far
as
your
rights
and
the
value
of
your
--
of
whatever
your
property
is.
would
you
be
in
any
different
position
than
you
are
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
they
can't
prove
it
before
the
land
division,
how
can
they
prove
it
before
the
district
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
rule
--
have
you
cited
any
authority
for
that
act
in
your
brief
that
that
is
the
rule
that
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
bureau
applies?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gilmore,
may
i
ask
this
question,
could
you
and
counsel
give
us
a
short
memorandum
on
this
question,
what
is
it
that
you
can
prove
to
satisfy
your
claim
in
the
district
court
that
you
cannot
use
before
the
bureau
of
land
management.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
further,
what
different
rules
of
evidence
are
there
in
the
bureau
and
in
the
district
court
on
that
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
in
the
--
in
--
just
a
short
memorandum.
i
don't
want
you
writing
out
a
brief
on
it
if
necessary.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
take
--
you
may
take
the
time
that
they
reserved
for.
