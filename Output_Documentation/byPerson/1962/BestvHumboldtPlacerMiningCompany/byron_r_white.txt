justice
byron

white
and
the
patent?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
you
do
--
you
can't
patent
--
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
if
you
amend
your
complaint
deserving
jurisdiction
in
the
condemnation
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
noticed
the
complaint
in
the
amendment
is
not
in
these
records.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
--
originally
there's
no
reservation
of
jurisdiction
printing
as
such.
i
assume
that
you
filed
your
condemnation
action
in
the
first
place
because
you
had
noticed
in
some
possession
of
the
mining
claim
that
a
--
in
a
possession
by
a
mining
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
of
any
other
instances
in
which
a
questionable
mining
claim
has
been
adjudicated
outside
the
condemnation
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
court
decisions
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
first
case
that
that
has
been
--
where
the
practice
has
been
touched
and
litigated?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district
courts
at
least
have
regularly
waited
some
determination
of
the
validity
of
the
mining
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
know
the
defendants
in
the
action
now,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
(voice
overlap)
some
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
serve
these
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
these
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
all
--
record
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
may
or
may
not
have
all
of
them
that
you
should
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
going
to
talk
about
the
--
of
the
solicitor's
decision
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
what
if
the
--
after
the
solicitor
makes
his
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
the
condemnation
court
ever
know
that
the
--
that
this
administrative
determination
of
an
issue
of
a
condemnation
action
is
going
on,
dispose
this
condemnation
court
on
this
case
knows
that
you
have
gone
along
with
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
it
but
--
you
never
go
to
the
condemnation
court
and
say
that
there's
an
issue
about
the
validity
of
the
mining
claim
here
and
we
take
it
to
be
determined
by
an
administrative
agency
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
court
orders
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
will
that
--
is
that
--
is
that
what
happens
to
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
a
court
order
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
no
order
in
this
record
indicating
or
any
--
anything
of
record
indicating
that
the
condemnation
court
of
the
--
was
aware
of
what
was
going
on,
on
and
approve
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
same
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
same
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
was
the
condemnation
act
at
the
time
of
that
particular
judge
for
the
southern
district
of
california?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
at
that
time,
a
particular
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
has
the
--
how
long
is
the
filing
generally
in
the
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
mining
claims.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
some
of
the
locations
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
are
actually
in
the
condemnation
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
there
ever
been
a
mining
that
went
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
the
issue
--
well
the
issue
before
the
--
in
the
--
the
issue
in
the
administrative
proceeding
would
be
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
department
also
has
the
authority
on
the
statutes
to
adjudicate
the
validity
of
the
mining
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
that's
part
of
your
cases
that
had
been
at
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
part
of
your
case
here
is
the
department
has
no
authority
anyway,
is
there,
under
any
statute
to
adjudicate
the
validity
of
mining
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
the
--
if
you
apply
for
a
patent
in
adverse
wouldn't
you
say
that
the
administrative
proceedings
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
there's
a
patent
(voice
overlap)
these
claims.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
situations
then
the
bureau
has
the
power
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
those
kind
of
--
in
that
kind
of
situation,
the
bureau
has
the
power
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
question
whether
they
are
now
--
and
would
you
really
have
the
same
problem
before
the
bureau
of
land
management
in
proving
that
you
had
a
valid
mining
claim,
as
you
would
have
in
proving
before
the
district
court
that
you
had
a
valid
mining
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
the
placement
of
value
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
wouldn't
you
prove
the
same
thing
before
the
bureau
of
land
management?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
is
their
rule
of
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
have
a
--
i
thought
the
government's
position
was
that
the
condemnation
court
in
aiding
it
to
determine
whether
anything
was
taken
and
the
value
of
it
would
refer
the
matter
to
administrative
agency.
the
question
that
is
certainly
is
referred
is
whether
there
--
anything
was
taken
at
the
time
it
was
--
that
possession
was
ordered?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
certain
but
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i've
litigated
for
the
bureau
of
land
management
about
several
--
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
you
had
a
discovery
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
they
have
mineral
property,
that's
what
exactly
what
the
government
denied?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
it
--
that's
what
we're
really
been
wondering
but
how
are
they
really
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
get
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
bureau
won't
get
--
even
get
to
the
principal
of
value.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
the
same
problem
you
have
in
the
district
court?
they
could
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
by
evidence
in
--
by
evidence
in
the
district
court,
you
could
prove
that
you
did
have
a
discovery?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
you
could
do
that
before
the
bureau?
