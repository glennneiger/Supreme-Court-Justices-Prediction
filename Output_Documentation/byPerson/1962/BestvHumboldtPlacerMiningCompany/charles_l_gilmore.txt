mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
a
few
things
that
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court
that
have
been
omitted
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
this
court,
beginning
back
in
about
1874
determined
the
question
of
the
character
of
a
mining
location
upon
the
public
domain
and
throughout
all
of
the
time
down
to
the
latest
case,
wherever
that
question
has
been
in
litigation
and
has
reached
this
court.
this
court
has
held
that
that
mining
location,
as
long
as
it
is
a
subsisting
matter
of
record
is
in
a
state
of
inheritance,
it
may
be
bartered
and
sold
as
any
other
form
of
real
estate.
the
person
who
owns
that
mining
location
or
his
successors
in
interest
may
mine
that
property
until
the
mineral
is
totally
exhausted
and
still
never
have
to
acquire
a
patent.
that
character
of
a
title
to
a
mining
location
is
unique.
let
us
not
confound
it
to
a
mineral
lease
under
the
act
of
1920,
because
it
bears
no
--
none
of
those
earmarks.
this
record
of
a
mining
location
is
made
wholly
and
entirely
in
the
county
recorder's
office
of
the
county
of
that
particular
state
in
which
the
mining
location
is
situated.
now,
to
argue
for
the
--
before
this
tribunal,
points
of
law
that
refer
to
some
other
form
of
holding
could
not
possibly
be
germane
to
this
particular
issue.
this
people
were
in
possession
of
these
mining
claims.
it
is
not
in
the
record
but
in
as
much
as
we've
been
arguing
beyond
the
record
and
all
over
the
map
in
this
particular
case,
i
might
as
well
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
of
the
claims
that
are
involved
in
this
particular
condemnation
proceedings
and
this
is
only
one
of
five
that's
against
this
company
are
a
matter
of
a
patent
application
that
was
pending
for
two
years,
that
whatever
filed
in
the
condemnation
proceeding
when
they
try
to
bring
to
this
court
the
statement
the
they
didn't
know
anything
about
the
claim,
while
that
county
was
overrun
with
experts
from
the
bureau
of
land
management
and
forest
service.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
the
county?
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
some
of
these
locations,
there
is
a
--
i
go
back
to
the
early
90's.
this
is
an
immense
area
in
--
and
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
some
of
the
locations
go
way
back
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
actually
in
the
condemnation
act.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
well,
mine
--
continuously
up
until
1942.
did
you
know
then
the
gold
closing
act
closed
the
mines
down?
since
that
time
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
will
be
nothing,
as
far
as
this
people
are
concerned
because,
frankly,
i
can
write
that
decision.
it's
going
to
be
eventually
written
by
the
solicitor
for
the
department
of
the
interior
for
he
has
already
said
and
he
determined
and
they're
defensive
and
their
particular
defense
in
this
case
is
predicated
upon
the
principles
that
the
solicitor
for
the
department
of
the
interior
has
declared
the
claims
invalid.
that's
where
we
start
from.
we
have
not
had
any
hearing
at
--
to
determine
anything
about
these
mining
claims
and
as
long
as
they
are
a
subsisting
matter
of
record
and
until
they
are
cancelled
they
are
real
property
and
they're
our
property.
they
don't
belong
to
the
bureau
of
land
management
and
it
doesn't
belong
to
the
united
states
because
this
court,
in
any
number
of
cases,
has
said
that
the
individual
in
the
possession
of
that
mining
claim
cannot
be
interfered
in
his
possession.
you
must
get
rid
of
him
by
some
other
process.
you
can't
go
in
and
arbitrarily
take
it.
the
united
states
in
it's
--
because
of
its
powers
under
eminent
domain
has
the
right
to
go
in
and
take
any
kind
of
property
for
it
chooses.
now,
we
admit
that
and
the
statute
so
provides.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
well,
i
can't
find
any
such
statute.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
it's
been
an
assumption.
it's
been
on
assumption.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
the
only
time
they've
ever
had
any
authority
is
when
they
took
it
and
they
talk
about
the
cameron
case,
the
cameron
case
this
court
was
careful
to
state
at
its
outset
that
cameron
went
into
the
--
into
that
case
without
objection
before
the
land
department.
but
some
30
odd
years
later,
the
department
of
the
interior
had
to
change
forces,
put
up
a
new
rule
because
in
the
case
of
o'leary
and
moore
the
secretary
of
the
interior
ruled
that
there
was
no
statute
providing
for
a
hearing
and
in
the
contest
against
the
mining
claim.
and
congress
does
not
pass
any
statutes
since
that
time.
i
don't
--
to
my
knowledge
and
counsel
has
not
pointed
out
any
statute
either.
we're
not
dealing
with
a
license.
in
the
brief
that
has
been
filed
here
in
the
petition
for
this
writ,
counsel
has
stated
that
a
mining
location
is
a
gratuity
from
the
united
states.
it
is
not
a
gratuity.
it
is
a
grant,
it
is
a
grant.
a
grant
of
this
full
and
complete
as
if
a
patent
had
issued
to
it,
as
long
as
that
man
complies
with
the
law,
does
his
annual
labor
and
he
doesn't
even
have
to
ever
get
the
patent.
there's
our
--
there's
the
question,
we
stop
right
there.
there
is
no
analogy
between
that
and
such
cases
are
--
as
are
cited
here.
we
--
let
us
go
back
and
take
the
situation
with
ration
--
with
relation
to
a
matter
of
eminent
domain.
in
28
u.s.c.
(a)
13
--
section
1358
is
a
very
short
section
that
says,
“the
district
courts
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
of
all
proceedings
to
condemn
real
estate
of
the
use
of
the
united
states
or
its
departments
or
agencies”.
it's
about
shortest
act
of
congress
that
i
know
of
and
that
what
is
very
clear
is
very
succinct.
it
means
what
is
says.
when
the
united
states
filed
its
condemnation
proceedings
in
that
district
court
then
that
district
court
has
a
original
jurisdiction
of
all
those
proceedings,
there
is
no
exception.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
i
think
so.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
well
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
yes,
but
the
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
that's
--
that
--
i
think
the
court
was
in
error
in
my
statement
and
argument.
that
is
also
in
my
brief
before
the
sup
--
before
the
appellate
court
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
--
that
it
has
the
power
to
question
the
validity
of
the
mining
claim.
there's
a
difference
between
the
language
that
is
used.
it
can
question
it
but
it's
got
to
question
it
before
some
other
tribunal
one
--
other
than
one
of
its
own
creation.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
you
see
--
pardon
me.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
i
have
submitted
myself
to
the
jurisdiction
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
--
but
that's
a
different
thing,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
well,
but
that's
an
adverse
claim.
that
goes
into
the
local
courts
and
decides
it
there.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
pardon?
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
over
that,
the
bureau
of
land
management
has
no
power
in
the
case
of
adverse
claims.
that's
--
that
has
to
be
referred
to
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
to
try
the
rights
between
the
two
parties
because
of
section
52
of
the
code,
3
u.s.c
(a)
says,
that
in
actions
between
private
individuals,
the
fact
that
the
--
that
this
--
the
paramount
title
may
be
in
the
united
states
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case.
it's
settled
without
that
because
there
are
--
they're
based
upon
peculiarity
of
the
mining
law.
it's
either
one
that's
claiming
under
a
grant
and
therefore
the
determination
of
a
right
of
the
title
of
two
parties
in
conflict
with
each
other
must
be
referred
to
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
and
that
is
a
policy,
that's
always
--
the
bureau
of
land
management
has
never
even
tried
to
assume
jurisdiction
in
such
cases.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
patent
(inaudible)
--
patent
application
was
filed.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
certainly,
your
honor.
they
could've
done
so
a
long
time
ago.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
still
laying
in
the
united
states
land
office
at
sacramento,
california,
right
there.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
yes,
but
we
can't
the
press
against
the
government,
your
honor.
they
didn't
just
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
--
don't
do
anything.
we
can't
take
adverse
proceedings
against
the
government.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
it
first
started
by
a
letter
of
june
5th,
1957
from
the
solicitor
from
the
department
of
interior
directed
to
the
attorney
general,
requesting
him
to
institute
proceedings
for
condemnation
of
these
lands.
now,
i'm
following
at
--
that
on
24th
day
of
june
1957,
the
instant
condemnation
suit
was
filed
in
the
district
court
of
sacramento.
that's
on
one
of
the
files,
your
honor,
as
i
said
before
but
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
--
since
--
at
that
day
on
that
24th
day
of
june,
the
writ
of
possession
was
issued,
the
declaration
of
taking
was
filed
and
we
have
been
out
of
possession
since
the
24th
day
of
june,
1957.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
i
don't
have
the
date,
your
honor,
but
it
was
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
--
preceding
then,
it
was
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
oh,
i
don't
know.
i
think
it
must
have
been
a
year,
a
year-and-half
or
something.
i'm
not
sure
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
i
didn't
start
those
proceedings.
another
attorney
did
and
he
withdrew
from
the
case.
so
i
have
--
have
had
little
to
do
with
that
because
this
matter
came
on
and
i
had
to
take
up
this
proceeding.
this
was
the
pressing
one.
we
were
faced
with
adverse
proceedings.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
well,
eventually.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
that's
right.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
that's
right.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
yes,
but
that
it
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
not
a
part
of
it.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
not
a
part
of
it.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
in
this
particular
case,
yes.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
because
we
don't
--
there
is
no,
i
can
make
myself
clear
on
that
point.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
well
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
i
said
that
they
had
the
right
to
inquire
into
it
because
they
had
the
right
to
inquire
into
it
under
our
patent
application.
but
not
to
intervene
in
this
particular
condemnation
suit,
this
is
indifferent,
entirely
different
proceeding.
in
other
words,
they
took
possession
of
our
land
under
their
writ
of
possession
on
the
24th
day
of
june,
1957.
now,
on
the
18th
day
of
april,
the
respondents
here
filed
their
proceeding
in
the
district
court.
there
was
(inaudible)
--
they
got
a
temporary
restraining
order
to
restrain
the
officials
from
proceeding
any
further
with
any
contest
because
they
had
just
filed
a
contest
on
--
i
think,
it
was
the
19th
day
of
march
of
1960.
so,
they
filed
--
so
when
they
filed
that
contest,
then
the
proceeding
before
the
department
--
before
the
courts
had
in
existence
for
two
years
and
eight
months
and
we
had
been
out
of
possession
by
the
time
that
contest
was
filed.most
of
these
properties
were
under
a
hundred
feet
of
water.
and
by
this
time,
around
five
or
600
feet
of
water,
and
we
can't
comply
with
the
rule
to
proceed
--
of
evidence
that's
laid
down
on
the
bureau
of
land
management
today.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
we
can't
do
it.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
because
we
can't
go
and
point
out
our
discovery
points
on
each
one
of
those
claims,
it's
under
a
vast
reservoir.
and
if
we
can't
point
out
our
discovery
point,
we're
out
of
the
picture
and
they
ruled
it
that
way.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
perhaps
it
had.
i've
had
that
--
point
i
have
never
considered,
your
honor,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
no.
what
we're
--
pardon
me,
your
honor,
but
what
--
but
the
--
that
didn't
--
that
isn't
the
question.
that
is
--
i
suppose,
that
would
be
within
the
general
powers
of
the
district
court.
i
don't
know,
i
wouldn't
want
to
make
that
statement
as
to
whether
it
is
within
the
power
or
not.
frankly,
i
just
--
i
don't
know,
we
have
a
case
similar
and
that's
pending
now
on
a
petition
for
writ
before
this
court
where
that
particular
question
is
involved.
but
if
the
bureau
of
land
management
has
had
the
opportunity
over
the
period
of
years
to
institute
its
proceeding
in
--
to
contest
the
validity
of
this
claim,
under
these
claims,
and
if
they
believe
they
had
the
right
then
why
wait
for
two
years
and
eight
months
after
the
federal
court
had
been
asked
by
the
chief
law
officer
of
the
department
of
interior
to
bring
these
proceedings
in
eminent
domain.
now,
the
chief
law
officer
is
the
solicitor
for
the
department,
he
has
said
in
his
letter
to
the
united
states
attorney
general
that
the
claims
are
invalid.
this
whole
case
rests
upon
that
statement,
using
that
as
the
basis.
we
are
charged
of
withholding
claims
of
--
that
are
invalid.
property
that
belongs
to
the
united
states,
properties
to
which
we
have
no
title,
we've
have
never
an
opportunity
yet
to
have
the
question
of
our
title
determined
by
anybody,
anytime
or
any
place.
it
should
be
determined,
i
believe,
in
the
district
court
which
was
importuned
in
the
first
place
by
the
department.
if
we
go
into
a
contest
before
the
so-called
hearing
examiner
system
invoked
under
the
bureau
of
land
management
at
the
present
time,
the
prosecuting
attorney
sitting
right
there
is
an
assistant
solicitor
for
the
department
of
the
interior.
that
hearing
examiner
works
under
direct
instructions
from
the
sec
--
from
the
solicitor
for
the
department.
now,
just
what
kind
of
opportunity
do
we
have
to
present
our
case
to
an
impartial
tribunal?
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
yes,
but
the
question
is
how
far
can
the
court
go
on
a
review
in
such
cases?
i
don't
know.
i
have
no
--
we've
never
reached
that
far
yet
in
the
department
of
the
interior
with
this
present
day
set
up.
up
until
1956,
hearings
were
conducted
by
the
register
and
receiver,
later
by
the
managers
of
the
land-offices
until
the
case
of
the
o'leary-moore
and
then
--
when
this
one,
secretary
seaton
decided
in
that
case
in
1956
that
there
was
no
statute
providing
for
hearings
in
mining
location
--
mining
claim
cases.
and
therefore,
the
department
would
have
to
comply
with
the
administrative
procedure
act
but
the
department
has
not
complied
with
the
administrative
procedure
act.
their
appointment
and
their
methods
of
handling
cases
to
this
hearing
examiner
system
of
their
own
does
not
comply
with
the
act
because
the
hearing
examiner
is
not
an
independent
judge,
if
you
put
it
that
way,
is
not
independent.
he's
under
the
domination
and
under
the
direction,
and
under
the
control
of
the
solicitor
for
the
department
of
the
interior.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
well,
as
i
say,
there's
some
of
them
date
far
as
back
as
in
to
the
90s,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
that's
right.
then
the
--
as
i
say,
the
--
for
your
honor's
information,
the
--
we
are
only
--
this
is
only
one
of
five
condemnation
cases
in
which
properties
of
this
company
are
involved.
we
have
a
lot
of
other
properties
in
there
because
if
there's
a
--
of
the
vast
builders
and
all
time
hydraulic
mining
operation,
where
you
put
water
up
against
the
bank
and
wash
her
out
and
get
the
gold.
purely
a
gold
producing
matter,
we
have
alleged
it
in
our
complaint
in
the
injunction
suit
that
their
valuable
claims
were
--
they
were
being
worked
for
their
gold
content
and
--
but
we've
had
no
--
we've
got
no
--
nothing
to
reshoot
that.
we
still
maintain
that
we
have
valid
existing
mining
claims
and
on
the
decisions
of
this
court,
they
constitute
grants
from
the
united
states
and
they
can't
be
taken
from
us
except
by
due
process
of
law.
now
then,
if
have
to
go
back
into
a
hearing
before
the
bureau
of
land
management,
we
are
prohibited
the
right
to
have
the
question
of
compensation,
determined
by
a
jury
and
in
--
so,
in
that
respect
we
are
denied
due
process
of
law.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
well,
we
would
have
had
the
right
of
review
a
long
time
ago.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
we
had
our
rights
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
we
would
have
had
our
rights
determined.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
but
it
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
most
assuredly,
your
honor.
because
at
the
present
time
we
cannot
go
in
there
and
prove
we've
got
a
dime's
worth
of
value
because
we're
under
six
or
seven,
or
5
or
600
feet
of
water.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
well,
but
we
can
prove
--
we
can
have
a
different
rule
of
evidence
before
the
district
court
in
the
condemnation
suit
because
we
can
prove
value
as
of
the
date
of
taking
and
this
court
has
decided
that
case.
that
rule
has
the
date
of
the
taking
on
the
24th
day
of
june
1957
but
before
the
department
of
the
interior,
we
can't
put
that
sort
of
a
rule
into
effect,
they
will
not
recognize
it.
it
will
be
as
of
the
date
of
the
hearing.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
something
was
taken.
certainly,
it
was
taken.
our
property
was
taken.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
we
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
we
can
prove
by
witnesses
and
by
our
records
of
location
that
we
did
have
a
location
on
that
property
and
we
maintain
them
throughout
the
years.
we
paid
tax.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
we
have
been
taxed.
yes,
we
would
have
to
at
the
present
time
and
before
a
hearing,
before
the
bureau
of
land
management.
but
we
could
prove
at
the
time
what
we
had
in
--
on
the
24th
day
of
june,
1957
in
the
condemnation
hearing.
that
would
be
the
value
at
the
time
they
took
it
but
it
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
--
under
the
land
office
hearing
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
well,
they
do
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
they
took
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
they'd
--
well,
they've
took
our
mining
locations
and
they
were
grants
from
the
united
states.
i
don't
know.
it
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
we
had
them
--
but
we
can
prove
a
valid
mining
claim
under
rules
of
evidence
that
would
be
recognizable
in
the
courts
as
of
the
date
of
the
taking.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
we
have
different
rules
of
evidence,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
as
i
explained,
we
have
to
prove,
as
of
the
date
whenever
we
have
that
hearing.
whenever
we
go
to
a
hearing
if
we're
required
to
go
to
a
hearing,
as
of
the
date
of
that
hearing
then
our
right
impinges
upon
that
date
as
to
whether
at
that
time
we
had
a
discovery
point
we
could
show,
we
can't
do
it.
the
one
point
alone
would
defeat
our
right.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
well,
i
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
i
think
your
honor
that
we've
--
we
are
thinking
of
two
different
things.
there's
the
difficulty
as
i
--
as
this
court
has
said
of
mining
location,
in
mining
location
just
the
mining
location
itself
as
long
as
it
is
a
subsisting
matter
of
record.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
well,
it
can
involved
difficulty
and
is
getting
tougher
all
the
time,
i
ensure
you.
the
thing
is
that
it
is
a
grant,
that
mining
claim
is
a
grant.
we
don't
ever
have
to
get
a
patent
to
it.
we
don't
have
to
do
anything.
we'll
mine
it
forever,
as
long
as
we
want
to.
we
don't
even
have
to
mine
it
as
long
as
we
do
the
annual
labor.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
yes.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
that's
right,
but
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
us
in
the
bureau
of
land
management.
according
to
them,
we
laid
the
--
they
laid
--
they
laid
down
the
rules
of
evidence
but
they're
different
in
the
rules
that
we
have
fight
--
have
to
fight
--
meet
in
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
the
time
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
well,
the
value,
i
think
of
the
property
taken
is
fixed
as
of
the
date
of
the
taking.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
well,
i
know
but
the
value
of
it
is
based
upon
in
a
court,
it
would
be.
but
in
the
bureau
of
land
management
the
question
is
was
there
a
discovery.
well,
we
can't
find
out
the
discovery
points,
your
honor,
and
therefore
we
don't
have
a
discovery.
we
lose
on
one
point,
we
can't
point
it
out.
we're
under
600
feet
of
water.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
no
--
--
no,
no.
i
will
not
have
that
at
all.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
absolutely.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
no,
sir
because
they
will
not
accept
that
proof.
they
have
a
different
rule,
different
settlements
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
yes,
but
then
that
brings
us
right
back
to
the
another
point
your
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
well,
i
know
but
that
un
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
--
unfortunately
that's
the
rule
of
evidence.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
no,
it
didn't
--
i
didn't
think
--
i
didn't
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
i
didn't
think
that
it
was
the
time
or
place
to
do
so.
i
didn't
think
so.
the
rule
speaks
for
itself.
the
decisions
of
the
department
themselves
speaks
for
itself
--
themselves.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
they
say
that
you
must
prove
the
--
that
if
you
lost
your
discovery
point,
you've
lost
your
claim.
we're
not
concerned
at
the
present
time
with
the
bureau
of
land
management
is
going
to
rule
when
it
gets
up
there,
or
if
it
ever
gets
there.
the
thing
is
if
what
we're
trying
to
do
at
the
present
time
is
to
determine
which
place
has
jurisdiction
and
administrative
view
or
the
federal
court,
the
federal
court
being
the
one
that
was
applied
to
first.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
yes,
my
--
that's
not
my
whole
--
(voice
overlap)
that's
not
--
that's
not
my
whole
case,
no.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
we'll
be
right
back
in
and
the
--
to
the
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
we're
lost.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
we've
lost
our
mining
claims
because
it
will
be
utterly
used
--
it
will
be
utterly
used
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
no.
but
the
court
wouldn't
have
right
to
do
--
the
court
will
not
determine
the
validity
of
the
claims.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
oh,
yes,
that
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
--
i
can
do
that
but
i
don't
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
i
don't
see
how
you
could
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
i
don't
think
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
i
don't
think
i
can.
i
don't
see
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
i
don't
think
i
can.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
i
think
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
i
think
the
ruling
of
the
solicitor
for
the
department
would
cut
us
off.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
no,
it
will
cut
--
he
will
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
no
--
yes,
they
will
because
he's
already
decided
against
us
your
honor.
he's
already
decided
the
case
against
us.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
i
can
if
he
says
that
the
land
is
not
mineral
in
character
and
there
has
been
no
discovery,
i
--
would
this
--
i
--
i'm
not
going
to
ask
the
court
a
question,
(inaudible)
partly
yes,
i
mean,
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
i'll
be
glad
to
your
honor.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
i
will
be
glad
to.
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
your
honor
could
i
have
time
enough,
i'm
a
long
way
from
home,
in
my
office
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
and
the
--
mr.
charles
l.
gilmore
thank
you
very
much.
