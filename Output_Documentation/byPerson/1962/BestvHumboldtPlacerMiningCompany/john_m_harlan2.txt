the
way
you
could
see
it,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
proposed,
the
government
could
do
--
in
order
to
get
immediate
possession,
you
have
to
file
a
suit?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore,
what
you
want
to
do
is
to
run
two
parallel
sets
of
proceedings
so
to
speak
--
one,
to
give
you
possession,
two,
to
adjudicate
administrative
remedy
for
the
mining
company.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
(voice

justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
would
spell
that
all
out,
you
won't
say
that
that
procedure
could
not
have
been
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
not
do
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
although
the
one
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
even
though
you
disclaimed
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
is
the
determination
of
the
department
of
interior
on
the
mining
claim
reviewed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
do
you
get
it
into
court
eventually
if
we
don't
agree
with
the
administration?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
there
any
substantial
number
of
these
cases
get
to
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
to
--
how
many
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
all
condemnation
proceedings
were
filed
in
the
department
had
to
go
in
and
started
this
contest,
would
you
have
said
that
that
was
improper?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
contrary
thought.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court
of
appeals
said,
absent
of
filing
and
the
pendency
of
the
condemnation
action,
the
appellants,
who
are
your
client
concedes
the
united
states
might
initiate
a
contest
proceeding
before
the
bureau
of
land
management
for
the
purpose
of
having
adjudicated
the
legality
and
the
validity
of
an
unpatented
mining
claim
on
the
public
land.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
wrong?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
gilmore,
supposing
the
government
had
filed
no
contest
at
all
and
you
got
into
trial
in
the
district
court,
and
district
court
said,
“well,
so
far
as
this
mining
claim
is
concerned,
i'm
going
to
withhold
jurisdiction.
i'm
going
to
send
this,
remit
this
under
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
to
the
department
of
interior,
the
land
division
to
get
its
expertise”.
would
the
district
court
have
had
power
to
do
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
basic
isn't
it,
that
this
issue
were
being
concerned
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
that's
a
different
question
because
if
you
choose,
if
you
don't
get
a
fair
hearing
before
the
department,
you
got
a
court
review?
