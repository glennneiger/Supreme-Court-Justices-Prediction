mr.
roger
p.
marquis
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
this
case
presents
the
issue
whether
the
filing
of
a
proceeding
to
condemn
lands
to
which
the
united
states
has
legal
title
but
as
to
which
there
may
be
there
is
asserted
rights
under
the
public
domain,
especially
here
the
mining
laws,
deprives
the
department
of
interior
of
its
ordinary
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
validity
of
such
claims.
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
question
of
power
of
the
district
court,
not
as
to
exercise
the
discretion
i
believe
because
as
i
would
trace
in
a
minute
the
district
court
exercised
its
discretion
in
favor
of
permitting
the
administrative
proceeding
to
proceed
in
a
normal
manner.
the
facts
are
few.
the
united
states
is
undertaking
the
trinity
river
project,
heart
of
the
central
valley
project
in
california.
this
is
in
the
northernmost
project.
it
has
been
added
to
the
project
in
recent
years
as
another
feature.
in
january
of
1957,
condemnation
proceedings
were
filed
covering
some
3000
acres
of
land
for
the
purpose
of
that
project.
the
lands
were
for
the
most
part,
public
domain
on
which
there
were
many
outstanding
mineral
entries
under
the
mining
laws.
in
that
proceeding,
as
the
district
court
has
specifically
found
the
right
to
retain
administrative
authority
to
proceed
in
the
usual
way
to
determination
of
validity
of
the
claims
was
expressed
expressly
reserved.
the
department
acting
under
the
regulations
and
the
procedure
in
1958
instituted
proceedings,
of
what
is
called
a
contest
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
i
think
it
was
put
in
the
complaint
simply
--
so
that
it
would
not
be
read
as
an
admission
that
all
the
mining
claims
were
valid.
i
don't
think
that
was
inconsistent
with
the
specific
finding
that
the
right
was
retained
to
determine
that
validity.
i
think
there
are
two
different
things
and
i
think
it
was
simply
making
claim,
which
we
often
do
in
filing
these
complaints
when
for
some
reason
or
other,
we
have
a
claim
but
we
want
to
condemn,
in
any
event,
to
make
that
allegation
in
the
condemnation
case,
so
as
to
put
the
landowners
on
notice.
actually,
it
isn't
provided
for
in
the
federal
rule.
the
rule
71a
concerning
the
allegations
of
the
condemnation
complaint
do
not
contemplates
any
pleadings
on
matters
except
right
to
take.
the
matters
of
compensation
are
not
the
matter
of
ordinary
pleading
and
the
form
in
there,
as
you'll
see,
has
no
provision
for
it.
the
only
provision
is
statutory
authority
to
take
what
the
purpose,
what
title
do
we
--
what
are
we
condemning
and
as
i
say,
we
put
these
allegations
in
there
so
that
people
won't
be
misled,
but
a
lot
of
times
the
--
it's
the
idea,
that
mere
filing
of
a
complaint
admits
the
property
right.
of
course,
that
was
the
subject
of
a
93
acres
case,
not
long
ago
in
this
court
where
it
was
held
that
there
was
no
such
admission
or
election
to
treat
the
property
right
as
valid.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i'm
not
certain
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
on
the
entire
3,000
acres
which
was
the
subject
of
this
condemnation
case,
i
think
there
--
i
think
there
were
some
outstanding
other
interest,
i'm
not
certain.
but
as
to
this
humboldt
case
because
this
comes
up
in
collateral
way,
we
brought
the
condemnation
proceeding
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
then
the
humboldt
company
brought
a
separate
suit
seeking
an
injunction
against
the
administrative
proceedings
on
the
ground
that
--
as
their
complaint
alleged,
all
questions
of
title
and
a
right
of
the
united
states
to
the
use
and
occupation
of
said
premises
are
wholly
and
entirely
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
it,
by
the
entitled
court.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
that's
right
and
that
was
their
theory
that
the
institution
of
the
proceedings
had
vested
in
the
condemnation
court,
complete
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
the
obligation
to
determine
all
matters.
and
that's
what
the
issue
is
here,
whether
it
does
so
or
not.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
but
that's
certainly
the
ordinary
thing
to
do.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
then
after
the
mining
claim,
it's
--
the
validity
of
it
is
determined
and
if
we
--
if
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
if
they
find
it's
valid,
then
we
go
back
to
condemnation
and
determine
the
value.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
and
what
--
our
view
actually
is
as
was
done
in
this
case
and
i
say,
has
been
done
in
many
others
that
we
file
the
proceeding,
we
obtain
the
possession,
which
is
needed
whether
the
claims
are
valid
or
not.
then
action
is
withheld
in
condemnation
while
the
administrative
proceedings
proceed,
then
the
administrative
decision
is
brought
back
to
the
condemnation
case,
and
appropriate
proceedings
then
take
it.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
understand
that's
--
it's
correct,
that
he
says
that
we
could
not
do
it.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
we
could
not
do
it,
that
there
is
no
power
to
do
it.
as
i
understand
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
--
as
we
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
that
is
what
their
holding
is.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
i
know
but
i
think
--
i
don't
think
they
put
it
on
election
and
they
couldn't.
it's
not
unintentionally
alleged.
so
that
i
--
as
i
under
--
as
we
read
their
opinion
they
put
it
on
an
election
as
a
matter
of
law
which
follows
from
the
fact
they
found
in
the
complaint.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
even
though
we
disclaimed
the
intent
to
do
so,
i
think
they
made
it
quite
plain
that
their
notion
is
that
our
intent
makes
no
difference.
in
the
course
of
this
discussion,
i
think
we
have
summarized
what
the
case
is
about
and
i
will
turn
to
--
first,
the
district
courts,
it
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
united
states.
on
three
basic
ideas
expressed
in
its
opinion
that
invoking
the
principle
of
a
court
with
jurisdiction
over
in
the
entire
controversy,
may
defer
its
ruling,
withhold
action
as
to
a
particular
matter
while
that
matter
is
determined
by
some
other
special
tribunal.
second,
that
the
bureau
of
land
management
has
special
competency
in
determining,
contesting
claims
to
public
lands,
that
the
star
chamber
charged
with
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
had
made
against
such
procedures
was
unwarranted
and
that
there
was
every
reason
to
allow
the
agency
to
adjudicate
these
claims.
finally,
he
pointed
out
--
he
said,
there
was
no
multiplicity
of
trials
because
the
court
will
not
try
the
issue
of
validity
of
the
mining
claim
which
is
a
different,
much
a
different
issue
from
the
validity
--
from
the
question
which
--
would
ultimately
be
presented
if
the
claim
is
valid
as
to
the
amount
of
compensation
based
on
market
value
of
the
claim.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
expressed
this
idea
of
election
and
i
think
its
one
sentence
on
page
40
of
the
record
epitomizes
its
notion.
no
statute
or
controlling
authority
has
been
called
to
our
attention,
indicating
that
the
administrative
tribunal
was
in
the
department
of
the
interior,
retains
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
the
validity
of
mining
claims
after
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
by
the
filing
of
a
condemnation
action
in
which
has
raised
the
same
issue.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that
was
on
page
40.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
a
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no.
sir,
it
starts
at
the
third
line
from
the
top.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
40.
our
argument
is
four
basic
ideas.
first,
the
general
principles
was
--
become
known
as
primary
jurisdiction.
the
power
of
courts
to
defer
to
administrative
agencies,
to
state
courts
is
very
well
established.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
--
that
is
--
a
great
deal
out
of
it,
yes.
i
think
that
expertise
in
the
sense,
not
only
of
familiarity
but
i
think
also
important
here
is
expertise
in
the
sense
of
having
procedures
adapted
to
the
subject
matter
you're
dealing
with.
i
think
that's
important
because
in
condemnation
courts,
as
i
pointed
out,
there
are
no
pleadings
relating
to
other
matters
than
right
to
take.
so
the
--
to
the
condemnation
courts
undertake
the
pass
on
these
mining
claims.
as
we
point
out,
a
great
many
of
them
are
dormant
or
stale.
the
administrative
procedures
dispose
of
them
by
defaults
or
some
sort
of
a
ad
hoc
procedure
would
have
to
be
adapted
by
the
courts
to
set
up
some
system
of
pleading,
answer,
publication,
trial
of
the
issue
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
(voice
overlap).
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
provision
was
in
the
department
are
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
but
as
to
judicial
review,
as
i
will
summarize
a
little
bit
later,
in
land
matters
there
has
never
been
any
general
statute
for
court
to
review.
the
exercise
has
been
in
terms
of
the
narrow
mandamus
jurisdiction
in
the
district
of
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
(voice
overlap)
--
it's
alright.
i
might
as
well
finish
the
subject
now
while
i'm
talking
about
it
and
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
recent
statute
in
october,
which
was
primarily
because
of
public
land
matters
of
various
kinds
in
which
congress
authorized
as
a
matter
of
venue.
this
is
very
general
and
we're
going
to
have
our
problems
but
they
authorized
federal
district
courts
throughout
the
country
to
(inaudible)
exercise
the
same
power
to
review
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
which
has
been
exercised
here
in
the
district
of
colombia
arising
under
the
old
common
law
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
it
would
be
the
same
court.
there
we
get
into
a
question
of
a
--
i
don't
know,
i
--
you
get
into
procedural
questions
then,
i
suppose
of
whether
it's
a
condemnation
court
as
such
or
whether
it
was
the
same
court
in
a
proceeding
unless
that
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
think,
undoubtedly,
it'd
be
assigned
to
the
same
judge.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
reason
can
be
given,
why
not
and
there
are
very
many
reasons
why
the
rule
of
deferring
to
expertise,
when
available,
should
apply
to
condemnation
cases.
third,
i
will
briefly
deal
with
the
thought
of
filing
of
a
suit
constituting
an
election
and
i
think
for
reasons
very
similar
to
the
93
acres
case,
and
then
a
very
short
extension
of
that
case
to
this,
that
such
--
no
such
election
should
result
from
filing,
simply
from
filing
a
condemnation
case.
and
fourth,
we
have
developed
in
our
brief
in
some
detail
the
background
of
public
land
law
makes
it
especially
desirable.
i
think
that
this
power
of
the
department
to
determine
these
complex
matters
should
be
preserved.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
elaborate
on
the
general
principle
of
power
to
defer
to
states
courts,
to
administrative
agencies
or
particular
matters
but
certainly
this
court
has
had
many
cases
on
that
general
subject
in
various
particulars
in
recent
years.
the
condemnation
cases
that
we
have
noted
in
our
brief,
not
infrequently,
wait
or
could
--
before
concluding
a
condemnation
case
until
state
courts
shall
determine
title
matters
or
for
instance,
tax
matters
that
may
arise
when
there
is
a
lien
tax
under
complicated
state
laws,
various
subjects
like
that,
matter
over
the
title
to
real
estate.
they
may
await
the
determination.
we
see
no
reason
why
those
general
principles
should
not
apply
to
condemnation
cases.
a
matter
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
the
county
of
thibodaux
case
is
very
close
to
that,
this
--
that
aspect.
if
you
recall,
that
was
the
case
where
the
--
of
the
city
of
thibodaux,
louisiana
power
and
light
case.
if
you'll
recall
that
was
a
case
where
a
state
condemnation
case
had
been
removed
to
federal
court
under
diversity
and
this
court
held
that
the
problem
there
of
whether
there
was
a
right
of
eminent
domain
in
the
particular
circumstance
by
the
city
should
be
deferred
until
the
state
court
could
determine
the
matter.
certainly,
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
there,
that
that
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
that's
right
but
i
think
that
--
that
demonstrates
that
there
isn't
this
complete
jurisdiction
of
a
court,
such
of
a
condemnation
court,
since
that
it
cannot
await
the
decision
of
some
other
body
and
that
--
i
--
when
we're
dealing
with
the
question
of
power,
that
is
distinguished
of
whether
the
circumstances
are
appropriate
for
wait
--
waiting.
and
the
question
of
power,
i
don't
--
it
didn't
seem
to
me
there's
any
difference
whether
we're
dealing
with
the
administrative
agency
or
the
head
of
government
or
whether
we're
dealing
with
state
courts
or
state
administrative
agencies
if
the
problem
arises.
well,
that
has
arisen
in
the
beaufort
case
about
the
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
concerning
the
wrong
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes.
well,
that's
something
else.
that's
(inaudible)
--
that's
the
area
as
to
exercise
of
discretion.
that
is
where
the
fact
of
the
mining
law,
the
public
domain
background
and
the
broad
powers
that
have
been
always
vested
in
the
department
of
interior
and
in
the
general
land-offices
since
--
oh,
1812,
i
think
it
is.
the
broad
power
to
deal
with
the
federal
property
becomes
important.
but
i
think
on
the
question
of
power
these
cases
are
in
point.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
normally
speaking,
the
validity
of
the
mining
claim,
as
against
the
united
states,
and
as
against
third
parties
is
there
--
are
two
entirely
different
problems.
i
think
that's
the
one
that
would
probably
be
the
answer
to
your
honor's
case.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
the
mining
claim,
so
far
it's
a
case
of
a
right
to
possession
against
other
people,
the
mining
claim
is,
may
be
treated
as
valid
or
it
may
be
--
may
be
investigated.
there
have
been
cases
where
the
courts
have
investigated
the
validity
of
mining
claims.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
would
think
so,
i
would
think
so.
but
what's
--
but
none
of
those
have
been
in
cases
and
there
is
this.
there
none
have
been
over
the
objection
of
the
united
states
and
really
i
don't
think
you
get
into
that
because
here
the
court,
in
the
exercise
of
his
discretion
has
said,
“well,
i
will
defer
to
the
departments”.
i
certainly
think
that
that
is
a
justified.
i
think
the
history
of
public
land
law
(inaudible)
--
not
only
the
difficult
factual
problems
you
get
into,
the
lack
of
procedure
of
the
court
as
contrasted
for
the
administrative
procedure
available,
which
is
much
more
suitable
to
adjudicating
these
matters.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
whether
the
title
--
whether
some
title
of
the
united
states
has
been
transferred
to
the
claimants.
that
is
our
basic
problem
that
this
is
--
this
is
the
united
states
dealing
with
its
own
title.
i
think
that's
the
reason
in
that
background
why
such
broad
authority,
in
terms
of
generalizations,
have
been
given
over
the
years
to
the
land
department
and
that's
why
this
court
has
over
the
years,
many
times
said
that
the
land
department
is
a
special
tribunal
constituted
for
this
purpose,
who's
rulings
and
for
example
in
many
areas,
and
i
won't
go
with
the
details,
in
many
areas
their
ruling
is
conclusive.
when
a
patent
is
issued,
it
can't
be
attacked
and
there
is
a
long
history
of
administrative
process
and
of
wide
administrative
discretion
and
all
implications,
this
is
perhaps
one
of
the
rare
fields
where
all
implications
of
anything
that
ought
to
be
done
is
in
favor
of
power
of
the
administrative
authority
unless
some
specific
statute
denies
it.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
not
of
title,
no
sir.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
mean
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
mean
the
issue
is
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
the
issue
is
whether
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
the
issue
is
whether
there
have
been
qualification
to
the
statutes
under
the
statutory
procedures,
so
as
to
obtain
some
vested
right.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
oh,
yes,
oh,
yes.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
let
me
put
it
--
let
me
describe
it
this
way.
maybe
a
little
bit
of
description
of
this
rather
unusual
mining
law
procedure
would
be
helpful.
there
are
three
stages
of
the
mining
law
procedure.
first
is
prospect,
you
can
prospect
as
long
as
you
go
peaceably
and
you
don't
get
into
fights
about
the
gold
claims
or
something
like
that.
a
person
can
--
first
goes
and
prospects
and
his
possession,
in
his
prospect
is
a
valid
right
as
against
third
parties
but
is
no
right
at
all,
the
mere
prospect
is
no
vested
right
at
all
as
against
the
united
states.
he
discovers
his
mineral.
the
gold
miners
found
their
gold
then
there
is
the
established
procedure
called
location.
whereas
you
put
up
monuments
around
your
--
you
state
your
claim,
you
file
under
local
law
in
the
county
recorder's
office
or
according
to
local
requirements.
that's
one
of
our
difficulties.
that's
the
way
the
thing
has
grown
up.
it
still
is
true
so
that
there's
no
notice
on
the
federal
records
of
these
mining
claims.
a
proper
discovery
and
location,
you
can
then
proceed
to
work
that
mine
and
you
have
a
right,
a
vested
right
to
that
possession
as
against
the
united
states
as
well
as
against
the
whole
world.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
then
you
don't
have
to
patent.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
then
that's
the
third
step,
the
final
step.
then
patent,
you
have
to
follow
procedures,
publication.
you
have
to
prove
what
--
claims
to
the
bureau
and
go
through
all
of
that
procedure.
payment
of
$500,
i
believe,
i
meant
$5
per
acre,
goes
through
all
those
procedures
then
you
obtain
the
patent.
of
course,
there's
a
difference
and
it
works
both
ways.
there
are
attempts
to
use
a
mining
claim
as
a
basis
for
securing
a
patent
when
actually
you're
going
to
use
the
property
for
some
other
purpose
once
you
get
the
fee.
that's
one
aspect
of
the
matter.
the
opposite
aspect
of
the
matter
is
that
if
you're
mining,
if
you
have
a
mining
claim,
for
example,
you
can
use
the
timber
on
their
land
only
to
the
extent
that
it
can
be
used
and
contributes
to
your
mining
operations.
you're
not
a
general
owner
of
the
timber,
had
the
timber,
so
that
--
but
on
the
other
hand,
people
may
go
on,
mining
for
years
without
seeking
a
patent
for
tax
or
other
reasons.
because
when
their
concentration
is
on
the
mineral,
they
don't
need
any
more
right
in
order
to
mine
the
mineral,
so
that
we
have
a
variation
of
types
of
rights
that
may
be
created
as
against
the
united
states
in
this
field.
so
that's
what
i
answer
when
i
talk
about
title
that's
sort
of
a
small
answer
to
the
matter.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
in
this
case,
they're
all
unpatented
mining
claims.
so
we're
in
the
area
of
where
they're
claiming
that
they
made
a
location
and
made
their
discovery.
now,
that
discovery
is
the
complicated
field
that
you
get
into
because
the
general
standard
is
and
has
been
over
the
years,
what
a
person
of
ordinary
prudence
would
be
justified
in
further
expenditure
of
his
labor
and
means
with
a
reasonable
prospect
of
success
in
developing
in
mind.
having
in
mind
all
the
physical
situation
of
the
quantity,
quality,
the
available
market,
what
kind
of
mineral
you're
talking
about,
all
of
which
gets
into
a
very
complex
subject
of
expertness.
the
field
manual,
i
think
this
is
something,
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
in
this
case
that
when
we're
talking
about
mining
laws
today,
where
this
is
a
real
--
it's
real
vital
today
because
these
mining
laws,
as
distinguished
from
the
mineral
leasing
act,
whereby
the
federal
properties
are
simply
leased.
that
applies
to
oil
and
gas
and
coal
and
three
or
four
other
minerals.
that
mining
law
still
apply
today
to
all
other
minerals,
uranium,
there's
14
--
there's
a
field
manual
for
examiners
that
go
out
from
the
department
of
interior,
to
engineers
to
do
the
field
of
examination
on
all
these
assets,
whether
there
is
a
valid
mining
claim
or
not.
in
which
at
least,
i
think
14
pages
of
double
columns
of
various
kinds
of
minerals
and
their
chemical
content
and
their
technical
name
and
the
like.
so
it's
--
that
is
the
area
which
we're
dealing
today.
this
particular
claim
of
humboldt
is
a
placer
claim
from
a
--
for
gold.
i
don't
know
but
i
think
it
is
one
of
the
secondary
recovery
processes
that
have
been
going
on
in
california
that
going
up
the
streams
where
the
49'ers
and
the
like
they
got
out
the
gold
that
a
lot
of
particles
went
down
the
river
and
now
it
becomes
valuable
enough
to
reclaim
those.
the
--
turning
back
just
a
moment
to
the
question
of
whether
there
is
anything
that
prohibits
the
trial
court
--
the
condemnation
court
to
permit
the
administrative
agency
to
complete
its
pro
--
proceed
with
its
process.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
authorizing
institution
condemnation
proceedings,
it's
just
as
--
it
says
nothing
at
all
that
can
be
construed
that
way,
it's
simply
the
general
statute
providing
that
the
federal
district
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
and
proceedings
brought
by
the
united
states
to
condemn
property.
i
see
nothing
in
there
denying
that
normal
power.
the
court
of
appeals
found
something
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
there's
nothing
would
permit
or
would
deny.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
don't
know
precisely
but
i
think
that
it's
the
necessary
field
investigation
preliminary
to
filing
of
these
complaints.
if
you
recall
the
bureau
has
no
records
of
these
locations,
there
was
a
mass
of
cases
here.
the
examiners
have
to
be
send
out
--
sent
out,
they
have
instructions
that
say,
quite
a
substantial
book
called
field
handbook
for
mineral
examiners.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
no
not
this.
there
was
another
one
which
we
just
referred
to
as
being
existent
which
has
no
particular
relevance.
this
describes
the
kind
of
examination,
the
field
examinations,
the
expertness,
the
matters
that
have
to
be
gone
into.
there
have
to
be
tests,
samples
taken,
samples
analyzed,
let's
say
there
have
to
be
examination
with
local
records,
there
have
to
be
--
all
of
those
matters.
local
recording
records
have
to
be
looked
into,
the
business
situation
has
to
be
looked
into
to
determine
whether
there
is
--
one
of
these
questions,
as
one
of
the
cases
we
have
cited
is
whether
there
is
presently
a
demand
for
this
mineral,
such
as
to
justify
the
validation
of
the
claim
as
distinguished
from
an
attempt
to
get
possession
of
the
land
to
use
it
for
some
other
purpose.
all
of
those
matters,
i
think
certainly
in
dealing
with
a
matter
of
this
size
where
we've
got
as
many
cases
as
this
district
court
had
pending
in
its
civil
docket
at
the
time
certainly
would
explain
the
reasons
for
not
acting
any
quicker
in
filing
the
complaint,
because
as
you
will
see
in
the
record,
the
administrative
complaint,
the
procedure,
the
contest
so-called,
which
can
be
started
by
the
government
under
the
procedures
starts
on
page
10
of
the
record
and
it's
quite
detailed.
at
page
11,
you
have
the
particular
claims
and
the
location
of
their
recording
and
they
have
particular
matters
that
are
dealt
with,
with
respect
to
particular
claim
(inaudible)
number
2
at
the
bottom
of
page
13
and
the
allegation
is
that
they
are
nonmineral
in
character,
minerals
have
not
been
found
within
the
--
insufficient
quantities
to
constitute
a
valid
reco
--
discovery.
all
those
matters
had
to
be
predetermined
in
this
process
before
this
particular
complaint
as
to
humboldt
could
be
filed.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
of
course
if
he
has
--
if
he
has
a
valid
claim
there
is
a
taking
at
the
time
of
possession
and
he
secures
6%
interest.
the
market
value
of
his
claim
is
determined
as
of
that
date
and
he
receives
6%
interest
as
compensation
for
delay
until
final
award
is
made.
that
has
always
been
considered
by
this
court
to
be
adequate
compensation
for
delays
between
possession
and
final
payment
of
the
money.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that
was
in
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
it
isn't.
the
condemnation
claim
isn't
in
this
record
at
all
because
we
have
the
findings.
it
was
--
i
--
as
--
my
figure
i
have
is
march
of
1960.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
with
--
this
was
as
we
said
some
39
--
over
3000
acres
of
land
we
knew
of
in
the
area,
it
was
all
go
mining
area,
i
think,
and
that
we
knew
of
existence
of
mining
claims
in
the
area
and
this
is
a
process
we
have
followed
for
a
number
of
years.
particularly,
for
example
in
the
appendix,
we
refer
to
several
cases
in
southern
california
on
the
various
marine
bases
and
gunnery
range
in
various
federal
projects
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
oh
yes,
the
appendix
lists
a
multitude
of
them.
if
you
will
turn
to
page
43
of
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
this
is
the
case
that
raises
the
issue
for
the
first
time
whether
that
practice
was
correct.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right,
i
think
that's
right.
the
--
it
has
been
done,
i
mean,
the
(inaudible)
--
it
has
been
the
practice.
i
think
there
may
have
been
one
district
court
case,
i'm
not
certain
about
that.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
we've
been
regularly
doing
that
in
the
south
--
particularly
in
the
southern
district
of
california
where
we
have
our
military
projects.
if
you
will
see
in
the
appendix,
i
think
you
can
visualize
the
way
they're
preceding.
they're
--
for
instance,
the
first
project
is
291
unpatented
claims,
121
not
examined,
55
had
been
validated.
soon
as
they're
validated,
then
they
go
back
to
the
court
for
determination
conferences.
105
unvalidated,
meaning
they're
invalidated,
held
to
be
invalid
and
two
on
which
there
(inaudible)
had
been
no
departmental
decision.
so,
that
we
have
--
that
has
been
a
regular
practice
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
alright.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
dam
reservoir
and
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
we
had
--
we
would
--
we
had
no
idea
what
the
claims
were
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
no.
the
way
it
happened
--
the
way
it
preceded
was
this.
we
filed
the
condemnation
action
then
--
and
that
--
incidentally,
this
is
two
different
bureaus
of
the
department
of
interior,
the
bureau
of
reclamation
comes
long
and
simply
it
needs
the
land
for
its
project
then
we
turn
to
the
field
staff
of
the
bureau
of
land
management.
the
first
thing
they
do
is
they
send
out
--
the
first
thing
they
do
is
send
out
examiners
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
no
we
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
that's
the
whole
point
of
this
case
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
we
bring
our
condemnation
proceeding
in
order
to
get
our
possession
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
so
that
the
project
can
get
going.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
we
know
as
best
we
can
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
it
may
--
(inaudible)
--
oh
yes.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
and
a
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
record
doesn't
show
whether
we
originally
served
them
or
not.
i
(inaudible)
--
i
think
we
did
but
sometimes
and
quite
often
we
will
find
other
claims
and
we
will
add
to
them.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
they
--
the
claims
themselves
--
what
we
would
do,
undoubtedly
is
look
to
the
county
court
recording
office.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
those
--
that
under
the
location
rule
there
had
to
be
record.
so
there's
something
there
in
the
record
and
of
course
there's
a
lot
of
times
when
there
are
over
filings
and
overlapping
in
all
manner
of
things.
so
for
our
condemnation,
we
simply
looked
to
our
county
court
records
and
join
those
people.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
and
if
we
find
more
and
this
happens
in
condemnation
a
great
deal
that
we
find
matters
developed
that
somebody
has
been
omitted
and
we
add
them.
that's
the
reason
the
rule
provides
that
we
could
amend
and
add
without
court
order.
that
is
the
practical
way
that
the
matter
precedes,
so
that
we
can
work
out
all
these
detailed
matters
while
we
are
in
possession
and
proceeding
with
our
project.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
don't
think
it
bears
on
the
issue
before
this
case,
before
this
court
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
because
i
think
the
issue
of
this
court
is
whether
the
district
court
has
power
to
defer
on
any
circumstances
and
that
would
be
a
matter
--
that
would
be
unless
you
could
say
that
the
plaintiffs
had
to
stop
themselves
to
challenging
the
power
which
would
be
going
or
rather
far
ahead.
so
i
don't
think
that
that
has
really
any
bearing
on
the
issue
here.
just
a
brief
reference,
as
i
said
the
statutes
are
silent
with
--the
court
of
appeals
ceased
on
the
language
of
rule
71a
of
the
federal
rules,
the
concluding
sentence
of
rule
h
which
is
determining
the
matter
of
method
of
trial.
as
your
honors
may
know
when
this
rule
was
adopted
in
1951,
prior
to
it,
there
had
been
a
great
controversy
as
to
just
what
method
of
trial
should
be
adopted.
this
rule
was
the
result
and
that
was
the
main
thought
that
was
being
dealt
with
here
and
in
great
detail
they
spelled
out
which
cases
shall
be
in
tried
--
to
be
tried
under
these
various
alternative
procedures
on
the
issue
of
compensation,
that's
where
all
the
focus
was.
just
the
issue
of
compensation
and
then
simply
on
the
end
and
make
sure
we're
not
going
to
have
title
matters
go
to
a
jury,
it
is
the
sentence,
trial
of
all
issues
shall
otherwise
be
by
the
court.
we
think
it's
clear
there
was
nothing
in
the
mind
of
the
rule
makers
at
the
time
and
no
warrant
for
reading
part
of
the
rule
to
exclude
the
--
as
we
say,
the
normal
power
of
a
court
to
defer
to
an
expert
body,
administrative
--
or
administrative
decision.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
it
goes
to
a
--
at
first
is
determined
by
hearing
examiner
under
the
administrative
procedure
statute.
there's
a
group
of
about,
i
think,
its
13
or
14
hearing
examiners
who
try
the
cases
that
get
to
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
you
appeal
to
the
bureau
of
land
management
in
washington,
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
land
management.
there
is
an
appeal
from
his
decision
to
the
solicitor
of
the
department
of
interior
to
whom
the
secretary
has
delegated
the
power
to
pass
upon
these
matters
then
you
go
into
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
under
a
proceeding
in
nature
of
mandamus.
as
i
say,
under
the
new
statute
you
can
go
--
i
think
you
could
go
to
the
various
district
courts
throughout
the
country.
it's
a
venue
provision
which
a
new
statute
which
it
won't
get
into
here.
but
turning
briefly
to
this
matter
of
election,
as
i
say
--
i
think
the
finding
of
the
district
court
makes
it
plain
that
there
were
no
intentional
of
election
to
forego
the
administrative
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
(inaudible).
i
submit
that
the
--
there's
no
basis
for
saying
in
law
there
was
a
compulsory
election.
in
the
93
acres
case
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
compulsory
election
or
remedies
when
we
brought
a
proceeding
of
property
which
we
had
leased
and
we
argued
alternatively,
the
lease
was
revoked
and
it
--
if
that
had
no
right
and
alternatively
that
if
they
did
have
the
right
we
would
condemn
it.
lower
courts
had
held
that
we
elected
our
remedy
by
bringing
the
suit.
this
court
refers
to
it
and
said
we
see
no
reason
even
justice
or
authority,
why
such
a
hobson's
choice
either
to
give
up
our
claim
or
to
forego
possession
should
be
forced
to
--
should
be
imposed
upon
the
government.
here
we
have
the
same
basic
problem.
first,
i
would
like
to
note
that
we're
dealing
here
generally
with
condemnation
cases.
its
mere
accident
of
allocation
of
responsibility
that
this
condemnation
case
was
filed
by
the
solicitor
of
the
department
of
interior
because
it
is
a
reclamation
project,
presumably
no
distinction
can
be
made
between
cases
as
in
southern
california
filed
on
behalf
of
the
army
and
the
navy,
marines
and
the
various
other
agencies.
and
certainly,
there
isn't
any
way
in
which
you
could
say
that
those
officials
of
those
agencies
waved
the
authority
which
the
secretary
of
interior
has
under
the
public
domain
laws.
the
decision
would
present
three
choices.
first,
postpone
the
project.
postpone
possession
until
it
claims
can
be
adjudicated
under
a
departmental
procedure.
this
would
certainly
be
prejudice
of
public
interest
in
a
lot
of
cases.
second,
to
secure
possession
in
the
condemnation
proceedings,
waive
the
administrative
authority
which
would
then
impose
on
the
courts
the
burden
of
determining
these
myriad
of
claims
and
again
i
think
it's
plain
that
there
would
be
great
--
considerable
delay
in
the
matter
of
adjudicating
the
matters
which
would
of
course
prejudice
the
united
states
in
terms
of
interest
liability
and
of
claims
getting
old
if
there
--
as
they
are
processed.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
the
difficulties
are
--
and
this
is
where
we
do
come
back
to
the
matter
of
expertise
and
the
matter
of
that
this
is
the
sole
business
of
the
administrative
agency
which
is
to
adjudicate
these
matters.
they're
familiar
with
them.
you
don't
have
to
educate
them
about
molybdenum
or
something
like
that.
they
are
familiar
with
these
matters,
they
have
their
set
procedures.
a
lot
of
these
are
taken
care
of
by
defaults
in
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
trouble
is
we
have
--
we
don't
have
any
rules
as
such
for
handling
--
the
court
handling
of
mining
claims
or
for
determining
the
validity
of
mining
claims.
the
court
would
have
to
invent
a
sort
of
a
code
for
handling
mining
claims
as
it
were.
there
would
be
difficulties
and
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
no.
no,
no
because
there,
a
great
many
things
are
worst
out.
the
factual
findings
of
the
department
under
the
public
land
laws
are
practically
conclusive
and
it's
just
legal
arguments
they
get
into.
there
is
very
narrow
scope
of
review
and
there
always
has
been
in
these
public
land
matters
because
of
course
there
didn't
have
to
be
any
review
at
all.
this
was
simply
the
united
states
giving
away
--
disposing
that
public
domain
for
its
purposes
and
which
as
i
have
said,
congress
has
always
given
a
very
broad
discretion
to
the
agency
and
a
very
limited
review.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
we've
had
them
coming
to
court
more
recently
in
the
district
of
columbia,
let
me
say
--
put
it
this
way,
we've
had
about
12
or
14,
i
think
it
is
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
columbia
in
the
last
year.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
by
the
time
you
get
to
the
secretarial
level,
i
mean,
as
compared
to
where
you
start
out,
you
may
start
out
with
20,000
claims
and
they
get
distilled
all
the
way
along
the
line
and
you
may
down
--
may
be
down
to
a
smattering
of
a
hundred
decided
by
the
solicitor.
that
is
very
rough,
my
statistics
are
just
out
of
the
air
but
that
is
very
roughly
--
as
i
say
you
--
at
each
step,
as
in
all
such
procedures,
some
of
your
people
see
that
--
well,
they
have
no
claim
they
give
up
or
they
see
that
the
matter
has
been
decided.
it's
a
factual
matter
that
the
hearing
examiner
decides
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
they
take
an
appeal
to
the
bureau
to
decide,
well,
this
is
going
far
enough,
that
i'm
just
wasting
my
time
so
that
on
the
whole
process,
the
matter
is
distilled
so
a
very
small
number
actually
come
to
the
courts.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
that's
what
i
was
describing.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well
then,
they
file
a
suit
in
the
district
--
up
to
october.
it
was
a
suit
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
nature
of
mandamus,
in
which
the
suit
against
the
secretary
and
the
solicitor.
in
which
they
challenged
the
validity
of
the
secretary's
decision
but
those
are
on
the
very
narrow.
this
isn't
a
general
review,
never
has
been
since
the
last
170
years.
it's
the
very
narrow
review
of
the
common
law
mandamus
that
is
where
it's
arbitrary
and
capricious
alike.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
no.
in
fact
in
--
that
time
and
time
again
they
say
that
there
--
as
to
the
facts,
it's
conclusive.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
venue
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
our
understanding
of
the
statute,
it's
simply
a
venue
statute
and
that
this
very
limited
review
that
as
always
been
emphasized
by
this
court,
time
and
time
again,
still
prevails
as
to
these
public
land
matters.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
i
think
it
goes
back
to
the
history
of
it.
and
as
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
this
is
a
special
tribunal
dealing
with
the
land
matters
and
it's
the
function
of
the
department
of
interior
to
adjudicate
between
claimants
and
to
protect
the
rights
of
united
states
and
to
get
the
policies
carried
out
which
was,
of
course,
to
have
the
lands
developed
for
the
general
economy
of
the
country.
so
that
having
in
mind
all
of
those
aspects,
there
was
always
the
broad
discretion
given
to
the
department
and
the
general
land-office
which
was
described
often
as
a
special
tribunal
to
handle
these
matters
with
a
special
competency
to
do
it.
that
is
a
history
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
oh
yes,
oh
yes.
there's
a
very
--
one
of
the
many
functions
and
that's
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
these
cases
that
we
get
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
there
are
two
claimants,
very
often.
say
to
an
oil
and
gas
lease,
yet,
we're
in
a
case
as
a
defendant
defending
the
secretary's
decision.
quite
often,
the
other
parties
will
come
in
and
we
will
find
--
we'll
have
(inaudible)
in
essence,
a
three-party
controversy
that
way.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
so
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
very
general
authority
is
in
the
power
to
--
it
actually
traces
back
in
the
earliest
days
to
the
general
authority
to
make
rules
and
regulations
for
the
public
domain.
it's
rather
startling
how
broad.
a
general
definition
was
given
in
the
very
early
days
to
the
general
land-office
which
then
proceeded
as
matter
of
history
to
devise
its
procedures.
i
think
you'll
find
that
one
of
the
most
interesting
spelling
out
of
all
these
matters
as
to
--
particularly
as
to
mining
claims
is
as
sought
in
the
case.
mr.
justice
van
devanter
in
the
cameron
case
which
we
have
cited,
he
spelled
out
in
detail
what
all
these
are
and
i
was
just
turning
to
it
to
see
whether
he
had
given
the
citation
for
this
question
you
asked.
he's
--
it
goes
back
to
catholic
bishop
of
nisqually
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
of
catholic
bishop
of
nisqually
in
158
u.s.
is
quoted
in
cameron.
while
there
may
be
no
specific
reference
in
the
act
of
1848
of
questions
arising
under
this
grant
to
the
land
department,
it's
that
administration
comes
within
the
scope
of
the
general
powers
vested
in
that
department.
it
may
be
laid
down
as
a
general
rule
in
the
absence
of
some
specific
provision
of
the
contrary.
to
the
contrary,
in
respect
to
any
particular
grant
of
public
land,
its
administration
falls
wholly
and
absolutely
within
the
jurisdiction
to
the
commissioner
of
general
land-office
under
the
supervision
of
secretary
of
the
interior.
now,
that's
the
source
and
then
over
the
years
the
processes
were
developed
whereby
the
procedures
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
practice
came
and
then
the
statute
is
really
what
is
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
--
i'd
--
i
just
don't
recall
your
honor
whether
there
is
any
special
statute
on
that
matter
or
not.
it's
been
so
well
settled
over
the
years
and
actually
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
anything
concerning
public
land
matters
is
within
its
jurisdiction
unless
denied
it.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
line
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
no.
the
line
is
drawn.
this
administration
continues
until
title
leaves
the
united
states.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
then
his
jurisdiction
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
then
the
jurisdiction
ceases.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
there
couldn't
be
much
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
mean
that
is
--
that
rest
on
the
united
states'
patent
and
the
united
states'
patent
is
conclusive.
so
that
all
these
jurisdiction
we're
talking
about
is
up
to
the
time
that
the
title
leaves
the
united
states.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that
is
within
--
that's
within
the
competency
of
this
special
administrative
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right,
i
mean,
up
to
the
time
the
title
leaves
the
--
the
department
of
interior
is
charged
with
management
and
handling
administration
and
disposal
of
this
federal
property.
this
is
the
theory
of
it.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
suppose
you
could
--
i
suppose
a
locator
could
contract
with
someone
else.
yes,
because
by
law
--
a
valid
location
rights
to
possess
the
land
arise.
there
are
many
variations
of
that
sort
of
--
of
those
problems.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
this
person
is
claiming
a
right
to
mine
for
gold.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
based
on
the
discovery
on
the
gold
and
location
of
his
mining
claim.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
there's
no
paper
from
the
united
states.
it's
based
on
conforming
to
these
requirements
of
the
law
as
to
staking,
filing
a
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
plat
and
the
like
in
the
local
county
recording
office.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
to
review
it,
that's
right.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
of
course
this
court
here
knew
it.
the
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
oh
yes.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
oh
yes,
the
court
--
that's
--
as
i
say
in
the
southern
district
of
california.
that's
been
the
regular
procedure.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
it
is
to
defer
and
yes
that's
right,
up
until
the
time
that
this
collateral
proceeding
was
brought
challenging
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
whether
there
were
--
i
don't
recall
any
exact
order.
the
judge
knew
they
were
(inaudible)
--
there
were
mining
claims
and
that
the
administrative
process
were
going
forward.
so
it
is
simply
that
no
order
was
issued.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
yes.
there's
the
court's
opinion
in
which
it
states
that
it
will
defer
to
the
administrative
procedure.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
oh
yes,
this
is
the
same
judge.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
same
judge.
on
record
19
in
the
bottom,
assuming
that
this
court
has
the
power
to
enjoin
further
proceedings
in
the
contest
which
are
now
at
issue,
there's
no
good
reason
for
the
exercise
of
such
power.
to
the
current
trade
there
is
every
reason
to
allow
the
issues
of
the
contest
to
be
resolved
by
the
administrative
agency
with
his
special
experience
and
expertise
in
these
matters.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
this
case
--
this
is
the
northern
district
of
california
in
sacramento
where
there
--
there
is
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
there
is
a
special
assignment
and
particular
judge,
yes
your
honor.
and
of
course
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
i
can't
say
--
i
don't
--
haven't
thought
of
immunity
as
having
anything
to
do
with
this.
this
matter
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
it's
a
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
its
--
well,
it's
down
to
this
particular
matter
of
public
domain,
as
i
say
stems
--
the
origin
was
the
original
general
land-office
which
is
in
fact,
the
real
estate
agent
of
the
united
states
handling
the
public
domain.
and
that's
the
kind
of
agency
that
we're
dealing
with
here.
thank
you.
