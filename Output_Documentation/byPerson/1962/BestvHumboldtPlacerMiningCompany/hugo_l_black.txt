40?
justice

well,
i
thought
you
said

that
was
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
a
court.
justice
hugo
l.

suppose
this
was
a
private
property
that
has
been
granted
the
right
to
condemn
and
with
the
lawsuit
between
the
private
company
and
that
owner
of
a
mining
claim,
is
it
your
idea
that
the
lawsuit
was
kept
to
be
held
up
under
the
secretary
of
interior
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
mining
claim?
justice

well,
what
would
that
--
what
could
be
the
result
there?
justice
hugo

black
even
after
the
court
has
tried
it
out?
justice

of
course,
they
are
appropriate
part
of
trial

that
time,

think.

if

of
what?
justice

brought
up
without
expressed
statutory
authority,
hasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
the
statute,
well,
where
is
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
look
to
it
to
determine
what
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
this
tribunal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
a
man
has
been
living
on
a
property
for
10
years,
claims
that,
he
claims
it
under
one
patent
and
then
another
claims
it
on
another
patent
or
claims
to
have
it
such
truthfully.
they
get
in
a
lawsuit
but
one
of
them
hold
the
matter
up
until
he
got
it
to
a

decision
by

then
the

is

--
the

having

justice

suppose
there's
dispute?
one

says
the

(voice

justice
hugo

black
anything
preceding
the
issues
of
the
patent,
you
would
say
is
that

justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
find
out
--
the
court
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
has
been
a
contract,
can
you
have
a
contract
to
do
some
mining
on
the
government
land
without
having
a
patent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
this
person
claiming
on
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
based
on
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
paper
from
the
government
on
which
it's
based?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
like
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
just
from
what
you
said
that
he
could
make
out
enough
to
show
that
he'd
complied
with
the
law
whatever
it
is,
to
get
the
mining
interest
that
he
could
go
into
the
secretary
and
ask
for
it,
but
the
secretary
decided
against
him
then
into
a
court
for
mandamus,
is
that
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
your
argument
as
to
the
power
of
this
tribunal
or
the
secretary
of
interior
make
the
final
disposition
over
the
--
of
questions
of
this
kind
any
time
a
pat
--
before
a
patent
to
his
interest
base
to
any
extent
as
a
rule
that
the
government
is
immune
from
suits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
based
on
the
idea
then
that
the
--
there
has
sprung
up
some
kind
of
administrative
agency
in
general
has
to
pass
something?
justice
hugo
l.
black
primary
--
a
matter
of
primary
jurisdiction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
your
whole
claim?
are
you
directing
only
on
the
fact
that
they
apply
that
in
the
courts
first?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happens
to
you
if
this
--
if
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
is
reversed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you've
lost
what
though,
what
have
you
lost
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
have
you
merely
lost
your
right
to
have
the
validity
of
your
claim
determined
in
the
courts
first?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
are
you
saying
that
the
judgment
here
is
reversed
and
if
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
reins
--
restored
that
you
cannot
still
go
into
the
land
division
and
have
this
matter
determined
and
then
subject
it
to
judicial
review?
or
is
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you'd
have
--
justice
hugo
l.

do
you
think
you
can
or
cannot
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
its

but
you
think
the
judgment
cut

off
from
a

black
--
a
hearing
before
the

justice
hugo

well,
if
--
you
mean,
cut
you
off
from
having
it
litigated
there
or
try
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
thing
is
they'll
decide
against
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
decide
against
you
on
a
bad
ground,
what
then?
on
illegal
ground,
do
you
then

do
you
think
that
you
will
have
no
right
to
have
that
reversed?
