you
mean
as
i
understand
--
are
you
saying
that
this

which
is
a
fairly
common
statute,
isn't
it
this
type
on
its
face
is
vague?

c.
clark
what

you
--
in
the
course
of
your
argument,
would
you
point
out
which
of
these
was
directed
to
the
georgia
supreme
court?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
is
correct.
justice
tom
c.
clark
was
there
no
evidence
claim
buttressed
on
the
federal
constitution?
justice
tom
c.
clark
was
it
the
state's
proposition
that
an
allegation
of

type
or
a
complaint
of
this
type
is
sufficient
to
direct
the
