what
the
general
--
what
in
this
record
would
leave
the
police
officer
to
believe
that?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
41
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
he
said
he
made
this
arrest
around
two
o'clock
and
the
schools
let
at
around
2:30
and
it
would
have
been
at
least
30
minutes
before
any
children
would
have
been
in
this
particular
area.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
that
isn't
what
the
superintendent
said.
precisely
you
read
part
of
it,
did
he
not
also
say
on
page
48
that,
“that
basketball
court
was
not
scheduled.
it
would
be
compatible
with
our
program
for
them
to
use
it
and
we
would
not
mind
them
using
it.”
then
he
further
say
on
page
47
that,
“i
don't
know
whether
or
not
we
had
a
plan
program
arranged
for
the
day
that
these
arrests
were
made.”
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
this
was
not
invalid
in
any
regulation
known
to
anybody,
is
that
correct
general?
because
as
i
read
his
testimony
on
page
46,
he
says
there
is
no
regulation
for
playing
on
a
court
when
it
is
not
in
use
and
there
is
no
one
around.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so
it's
your
contention
that
substance
is,
there
being
no
regulation
against
the
use
when
it
is
not
being
used
by
anyone
else.
there
being
no
children
evident
in
the
vicinities
since
they
were
not
out
of
school
until
2:30.
then
it
becomes
a
disturbance
of
the
peace,
that
the
group
of
men
are
there
playing
using
an
empty
court,
it
becomes
a
disturbance
of
the
peace
if
you
do
not
obey
a
police
officer
or
an
officer
when
he
says,
“while
they're
here
legally
and
properly
and
not
against
any
regulation,
i
tell
you
now
to
move
on.”
is
that
disturbance
of
the
peace?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
i
mean
the
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
the
superintendent
said
that
they
were
there
illegally
and
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
the
--
didn't
we
both
agree
a
moment
ago
that
there
is
no
regulation
for
playing
on
a
court
when
it
is
not
in
use
and
there's
no
one
around?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
here
then
would
you
define
what
constituted
the
disturbance
of
the
peace
under
these
circumstances.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
illegal?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
imagine
what
the
officer
said,
can
we
also
imagine
that
these
fellows
came
out
in
the
park
to
test
the
segregation
questioned
in
the
park
and
prepared
to
take
the
consequences
of
that
if
there
might
be
some
trouble
if
they
did?
would
that
be
a
fair
inference
from
this
record?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
which
might
create
some
problems?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
you'd
he
had
the
right
to
do
it.
and
that
he
would
be
protected
and
he
has
the
right
not
arrested
for
exercise,
is
that
what
you
said?
