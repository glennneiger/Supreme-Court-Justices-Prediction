mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
somewhat
unlikely
six
cases
which
have
preceded
it
this
week
and
that
here,
arrest
have
been
made
for
conduct
on
city
property,
city
park
property,
managed
by
a
city
department
but
it
is
similar
to
those
other
six
cases.
and
that
here
again,
the
police
are
engaged
in
enforcing
segregation
customs
as
if
they
were
an
extension
of
or
part
of
the
law.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
brought
by
six
young
negro
men
from
savannah,
who
were
convicted
of
the
crime
of
unlawful
assembly
under
section
26-5301
of
georgia
code,
that
statute
which
appears
on
page
2
of
our
brief
punishes
any
two
or
more
person
who
assemble
and
this
is
the
key
language,
assemble
for
the
purpose
of
disturbing
the
public
peace
or
committing
any
unlawful
act
and
fails
to
disperse
on
the
command
of
peace
officers,
etcetera.
the
petitioners
were
charged
under
an
accusation
filed
substantially
in
the
statutory
language
for
assembling
at
daffin
park
in
savannah,
georgia
for
the
purpose
of
disturbing
the
public
peace.
no
reference
was
made
in
the
accusation
to
the
second
clause
relating
to
committing
any
unlawful
act.
and
petitioners
were
convicted
in
the
city
court
of
savannah
by
a
jury
and
sentenced
to
fines
or
to
imprisonment
in
default
of
payment
of
the
fines.
on
appeal,
their
convictions
were
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
in
the
courts
below
and
here,
we
contend
the
petitioners
have
asserted
due
process
claims
that
they
were
convicted
without
evidence
of
their
guilt
and
convicted
under
a
vague
statute
which
denied
them
due
process.
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
facts
in
some
detail
because
of
the
no
evidence
claim.
the
four
witnesses
testified
at
the
trial
in
the
state
court.
two
of
them
were
--
only
two
of
them
were
witnesses
to
the
incident
which
led
to
the
arrest.
they
were
the
two
arresting
officers.
the
other
two
people
who
have
testified
were
police
sergeant
who
came
upon
the
scene
after
the
arrest
had
been
made
and
the
head
of
the
city
park
department
who
wasn't
there
at
all.
it
had
no
contact
with
the
petitioners
whether
a
witness
to
the
incident.
he
didn't
know
about
it
until
after.
so
that
the
facts
i'm
giving
you,
the
arresting
officers'
version
of
what
transpired
and
i
submit
that
it
demonstrates
completely
that
the
petitioners
are
guilty
of
no
criminal
acts
of
any
kind.
now,
on
january
23rd,
1961
at
about
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
police
officers
thompson
and
hillers
were
on
duty
in
daffin
park
which
is
a
50-acre
recreational
park
which
as
i
have
said
is
managed
and
operated
by
the
city
of
savannah.
they
were
in
their
currently
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
understand
that
that
is
the
fact,
your
honor,
and
that
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
the
testimony
of
the
park
manager
at
page
--
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
42,
indicates
that
he
is
the
superintendent
of
the
recreational
department
of
the
city
and
as
superintendent,
he
is
overall
the
pick
playgrounds
in
the
city
and
later
on
in
his
testimony,
he
lists
them
and
mentions
the
daffin
park.
there's
no
explicit
statement
about
ownership
but
it's
never
been
contested.
and
i'm
sure
that
the
city
attorneys
will
confirm
that.
now,
where
officers
thompson
and
hillers
were
approached
by
a
person
who
was
identified
only
in
the
record
as
a
white
lady,
and
she
is,
according
to
officer
thompson's
testimony
supposed
have
told
them
that
there
were
colored
people
playing
basketball
in
the
park.
and
officer
thompson
made
it
clear
that
as
soon
as
he
heard
this,
he
pres
--
he
and
his
fellow
officer
preceded
immediately
to
the
basketball
court.
he
said,
“i
did
not
ask
this
white
lady
how
old
these
people
were.
as
soon
as
i
found
out
these
were
colored
people,
i
immediately
went
there.”
and
when
officers
thompson
and
hillers
got
to
the
basketball
court,
they
found
the
six
petitioners
playing
basketball.
both
officers
agreed
that
that
was
all
it
was
going
on.
officer
hillers'
testimony
at
page
50
says,
“when
i
arrived,
the
defendants
were
playing
basketball.
they
were
not
necessarily
creating
any
disorder.
they
were
just
shooting
at
the
goal.
that's
all
they
were
doing.
they
weren't
disturbing
anything.”
and
officer
thompson's
testimony
at
page
41
is
the
same.
he
said
that
at
the
middle
of
the
page,
“i've
observed
the
conduct
of
these
people
when
they
were
on
the
basketball
court
and
they
were
doing
nothing
besides
playing
basketball.”
he
goes
on
to
say,
they
were
normally
playing
basketball
and
no
children
around.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
there
were
no
children
around.
in
the
earlier
point
in
his
testimony,
mr.
justice
black,
he
had
mentioned
that
there
were
schools
in
the
neighborhood.
that
the
schools
let
out
at
about
2:30
in
the
afternoon
and
that
at
that
time,
the
children
usually
came
to
this
area
to
play
but
that
this
was
about
two
o'clock.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
--
at
per
se,
no,
sir.
no,
sir.
this
facility
was
obviously
designed
for
playing
basketball.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no.
that
is
correct.
the
city
in
its
brief
in
this
court
makes
an
argument
about
a
park
rule
or
a
claimed
argument
that
this
facility
was
for
children
and
not
for
adults.
this
was
something
that
was
never
relied
upon
by
the
arresting
officer.
again
on
page
41,
the
officer
expressly
disclaimed
any
reliance
on
this.
at
the
end
of
that
first
paragraph
--
the
first
paragraph
which
starts
on
the
page,
officer
thompson
said,
“i
have
never
made
previous
arrests
in
daffin
park
because
people
played
basketball
there.
i
don't
have
any
knowledge
from
myself
that
any
certain
age
group
is
limited
to
any
particular
basketball
court.
i
don't
know
the
rules
of
the
city
recreational
department.”
officer
thompson
gave
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
your
honor.
there
were
no
written
rules.
there
was
some
testimony
by
the
park
superintendent
as
to
certain
preferences
and
priorities
that
he
had
in
his
own
mind.
i
submit
that
these
were
very
vaguely
defined
and
in
part
contradictory
but
the
important
thing
is
that
there
is
no
reason
at
all
to
think
that
the
petitioners
had
any
notice
of
what
was
in
the
park
superintendent's
mind
or
any
reason
to
--
or
an
opportunity
to
know
about
it.
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
your
honor,
there's
a
general
finding
of
guilty.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
there
is
no
indication
to
that
of
anything
of
that
kind.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
there
is
only
a
general
finding
of
guilty
by
the
jury.
there
are
no
court
findings
in
the
record.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
charge
--
no,
sir.
the
charge
to
the
jury
contained
no
discussion
of
the
evidence,
no
definition
of
the
offense
beyond
a
reading
of
the
statute
to
the
jury
and
a
statement
to
them
that
these
police
officers
were
peace
officers
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
that
was
the
only
explanation
of
the
statute
given
to
the
jury.
now,
turning
again
to
the
scene
when
the
officers
arrived,
they
proceeded
immediately
upon
arriving
to
order
these
petitioners
to
leave
the
basketball
court.
at
this
point,
one
petitioner
asked
the
officer
who,
as
officer
thompson,
who
ordered
him
to
come
out
here
and
what
does
authority
well
to
come
out
here
and
order
them
all,
and
officer
thompson
responded
that
he
didn't
need
any
authority,
he
didn't
need
any
orders.
and
another
petitioner
began
to
write
down
the
officer's
badge
numbers
and
when
they
didn't
leave
after
a
few
moments,
they
were
all
placed
under
arrest.
now,
officer
thompson
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
sir.
no
indication
of
that
at
all.
in
fact,
the
state
attempts
to
make
something
of
the
fact
that
these
--
i
don't
quite
understand
how
this
helps
the
state's
case
but
they
attempt
to
argue
something
from
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
were
cooperative
with
the
officers
and
got
in
his
car
without
any
arguing
and
when
they
were
placed
under
arrest.
the
--
when
the
--
officer
thompson
testified
at
the
trial,
he
stated
in
language
that
is
clear
as
day
on
page
41,
that
he
had
a
racial
reason
for
this
arrest.
right
in
the
middle
of
the
page
there,
beginning
of
that
paragraph
he
said,
“i
arrested
these
people
for
playing
basketball
in
daffin
park.
one
reason
was
because
they
were
negroes.”
and
everything
about
his
conduct
confirms
that
that
was
--
he's
consistent
with
that
reason.
and
that,
he
said
that
he
immediately
went
to
the
scene
when
he
found
out
that
colored
people
were
playing
in
the
park.
and
there
is
additional
testimony
in
the
record
that
this
park
was
one
which
it
customarily
been
used
only
by
white
people.
that
the
city
of
savannah
establishes
its
parks
in
colored
and
white
neighborhood
as
such.
that
if
the
park
superintendent
testified
that
it
was
customary
to
use
this
park
separately
for
the
different
races
at
page
45.
now,
officer
thompson
also
mentioned
another
reason
which
is
if
it
means
anything
related
to
race
but
is
really
completely
unsubstantiated,
he
said
that
he
may
--
he
said
at
another
point
on
page
40
that
the
purpose
of
asking
them
to
leave
was
to
keep
them
trouble
which
appeared
to
him
might
start
and
he
referred
to
the
fact
that
there
were
five
or
six
cars
driving
around
the
park
with
white
people
in
it.
at
another
place
on
cross-examination,
he
acknowledged
that
these
cars
were
on
a
driveway
which
passed
the
court,
basketball
courts,
and
that
this
was
not
unusual
traffic
for
the
time
of
the
day.
curios
thing
about
the
testimony
is
that
there's
nothing
at
all
--
at
all
to
give
us
any
information
about
the
conduct,
the
demeanor
of
these
people
within
the
cars,
there's
nothing
to
even
indicate
that
they
observed
the
petitioners,
that
the
petitioners
observed
them.
there's
no
indication
that
they
slowed
down,
that
they
drove
by
repeatedly.
there's
nothing
at
all
to
make
--
to
connect
this
up.
and
as
a
justification
of
substantiation
the
officers
expressed
for
their
fears
of
trouble
might
start.
there
was
no
one
else
around.
there
was
no
one
else
present
on
the
--
in
the
area
at
all.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
charge
of
the
jury
or
the
accusation?
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
charge
to
the
jury,
your
honor,
which
appears.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
that's
right.
that's
how
i
view
it,
your
honor.
the
--
but
in
any
event,
the
--
this
was
one
of
the
things
expressed
by
the
officer
during
the
trial.
beyond
this,
there
is
none.
beyond
this
is
completely
unsubstantiated
fear
of
trouble.
and
his
positive
statement
that
his
other
reason
was
because
they
were
negroes,
that
is
the
state's
proof.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
don't
know
if
your
honor
misread
that
on
that.
it's
unlawful
act.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it's
for
committing
any
unlawful
act.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
you're
reading
from
the
judge's
charge
to
the
jury.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
is
a
misquotation
of
the
statute
as
it
appears
in
the
code.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
whether
that
represents
what
he
read
to
the
jury
or
not,
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
we
have
only
the
court
report
or
certificates.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
correct.
the
correct
statute
appears
to
be
--
to
my
brief.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
--
well,
i
don't
believe
that
he
charged
them
anything
and
i
point
out
again
as
i
attempted
too
early
that
the
accusation
itself
never
relied
on
that
part
of
the
statute
committing
any
unlawful
act.
this
is
something
which
the
court
below
also
observed
in
its
opinion
when
it
said
the
only
thing
involved
with
the
phrase
‘disturbing
the
public
peace'
or
‘purpose
of
disturbing
a
public
peace'.
in
answer
to
your
honor,
the
original
question
i'm
at
who
ever
this
statute
covered
this
conduct.
i
state
that
this
statute
is
probably
so
vague
and
indefinite
that
it
could
cover
almost
any
type
of
lawful
conduct.
this
statute
has
been
authoritatively
construed
by
the
georgia
court
of
appeals
to
go
to
cover
acts
which
i
consider
beyond
the
common
law
meaning
of
this
type
--
to
go
beyond
the
common
law
concept
of
unlawful
assembly
and
the
only
appellant
decision
construing
this
statute
in
a
prosecution
order,
state
against
sanders.
this
statute
was
applied
to
sit-in
demonstrators
on
facts
substantially
the
same
as
those
in
two
of
the
cases
in
garner
against
louisiana.
these
were
people
who
have
not
been
ordered
out
of
a
store
by
any
proprietor.
and
people
who
were
there
in
sufferance
of
the
proprietor
who
were
ordered
out
by
police
officer.
and
in
that
opinion,
it
seems
to
me
evident
that
the
court
took
this
statute
beyond
any
common
law
concept
of
disturbing
a
peace
and
applied
it
through
the
area
of
liberty
protected
by
due
process
clause.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i'm
arguing.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i'm
arguing
--
i'm
making
both
of
those
arguments
and
a
third
argument
which
i
haven't
express
yet
that
the
statute
didn't
give
them
fair
warning,
their
particular
acts
were
prohibited.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
your
honor
has
perhaps
observed
that
the
georgia
supreme
court's
opinion
does
not
at
all
discuss
the
facts.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
this
is
a
curious
thing
that
might
attract
the
attention
of
the
court.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
no
evidence
issue,
the
vagueness
--
and
the
vagueness
of
the
statute
in
all
of
the
applications
of
that
term
were
properly
argued
and
preserved
at
every
stage
of
the
proceedings
in
the
state
court.
the
vague
--
due
process
vagueness
question
was
first
raised
in
a
demurrer.
it
was
again
raised
in
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
as
it
was
the
claim
that
there
was
no
evidence
upon
which
the
defendants
could
be
convicted.
the
assignments
of
error
contended
that
the
court
did
err
in
overruling
that
motion
for
new
trial
which
embodied
the
no
evidence
claim
and
a
due
process
vagueness
claim.
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
no
evidence
claim
--
i
think
it's
inherently
a
federal
issue
your
honor
that
it
appears
at
page
17
of
the
record.
this
is
the
--
there
were
six
identical
motions
for
new
trial.
this
is
the
first
one
and
paragraph
one
says
that
the
verdict
is
contrary
to
evidence
and
without
evidence
to
support.
there
was
no
particular
reference
at
that
point
for
the
due
process
clause
but
i
believe
that
thompson
against
the
city
of
louisville
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
conviction
without
evidence
is
inherently
a
due
process
matter.
now,
the
states
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
don't
believe
that
thompson
indicates
anything
on
that
one
way
or
another.
however,
i
submit
that
this
court
--
this
georgia
supreme
court's
attention
wasn't
directed
to
the
problem
which
we're
attempted
to
raise
here.
i'll
try
to
tell
you
why.
the
basis
upon
which
the
georgia
supreme
court
determined
currently
not
to
consider
the
evidence
was
a
theory
that
the
petitioners,
the
defendants
there,
had
impliedly
abandoned
their
claim
that
the
--
there
was
error
in
overruling
the
motion
for
new
trial
by
their
brief
in
the
georgia
supreme
court.
we
--
when
the
record
and
the
petition
for
certiorari
were
filed
here
certified
copies
of
all
of
those
briefs
were
deposited
with
the
clerk
here
so
that
they're
available
for
the
court
to
inspect.
now,
we
submit
that
that
brief
defines
what
will
have
of
these
petitioners
and
the
court
below.
while
it
did
not
say
in
the
section
labeled
argument,
while
there
was
no
subsection
saying,
“we
are
now
arguing
our
motion
for
new
trial”,
nevertheless
did
argue
these
due
process
issues.
in
that,
it
did
argue
the
facts
of
the
case.
it
did
argue
that
the
petitioners
who
were
convicted
for
innocent
acts.
it
did
argue
that
the
officer's
conduct
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
there
was
a
long
quote
from
the
language
in
the
yick
wo
case
about
arbitrary
application
of
statutes.
and
i
might
point
out
that
when
the
court
decided
thompson
against
louisville,
it
cited
in
support
of
the
notion
--
in
support
of
the
holding
that
conviction
without
evidence
was
a
denial
of
due
process.
one
of
the
cases
that
was
cited
was
yick
wo.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
it
was.
i
don't
know
that
the
respective
dates
on
hand
your
honor
but
i
know
that
the
date
of
decision
in
the
state
supreme
court
was
november
a
year
ago.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
i
have
no
knowledge
as
to
when
the
briefs
are
filed.
the
copies
are
deposited
with
the
clerk
and
they
very
well
indicate
that.
now,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
it
was
not
your
honor.
i
believe
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
may
it
please
the
court.
these
were
the
first
negroes
to
play
on
this
basketball
court.
there
was
some
evidence
that
the
young
children
had
fished
in
daffin
park.
but
all
the
witnesses
agreed
these
were
the
first
--
no
colored
children
had
played
basketball
here.
as
i
understand
the
state's
argument
it
is
that
negro
is
welcome
in
this
park
and
has
the
right
to
play
there,
but
he
doesn't
have
a
right
to
come
there
for
the
purpose
of
finding
out
if
there
so.
in
any
event,
this
is
a
segregated
park
to
me
where
the
only
negroes
--
segregated
basketball
court
where
they
only
negroes
who
go
there
get
arrested.
people
against
galvin,
a
new
york
case
was
mentioned
and
that
case
involved
no
constitutional
issue
state
or
federal.
this
is
direction
of
a
state
law.
now,
this
argument
that
com
--
the
state
makes
that
there
was
a
purpose
to
commit
a
breach
of
the
peace
is
an
intent
to
prove
a
state
of
mind.
it's
an
attempt
to
prove
a
state
of
mind
in
a
case
where
there's
no
admission
of
such
a
purpose
and
where
there
are
no
circumstances
from
which
you
could
infer
such
a
purpose.
the
circumstances
of
the
state
points
to
are,
one,
the
fact
that
these
are
negroes
in
a
white
neighborhood,
and
two,
a
claim
that
this
playground
was
reserved.
now,
if
the
--
if
you
accept
the
state's
case
as
a
strong
case
that
maybe
somehow
this
area
was
reserved
for
children,
you
still
can't
get
an
inference
of
an
intent
to
commit
a
crime
without
making
an
unconstitutionally
impermissible
use
of
the
statute
to
permit
someone
to
be
punished
where
he
didn't
know.
they
had
no
opportunity
to
know
of
this
rule,
that
he
was
breaking
the
rule.
there
were
no
signs
around
that
this
was
reserved
for
children.
this
--
there's
nothing
in
this
case,
in
mr.
hagan's
testimony
remotely
rising
through
the
dignity
of
a
rule
or
regulation.
the
best
you
can
get
is
that
he
had
a
personal
preference,
department
preference
unexpressed
to
anyone
until
the
trial
for
children
to
use
the
basketball
court.
and
there
are
some
--
in
his
testimony
about
of
it
being
reserved
for
the
use
of
the
schools
he
says
they
are
more
or
less
left
available
for
them.
but
there's
no
reason
i
think
that
the
petitioners
had
any
opportunity
to
know
this.
so
the
statute
would
be
doubly
vague.
indeed,
this
is
very
reminiscent
of
the
problem
in
niemotko
against
maryland
where
the
petitioners
before
this
court
were
convicted
of
disorderly
conduct
for
holding
a
religious
meeting
in
a
public
park
where
the
--
there
was
no
--
and
the
only
claim
of
disorderly
conduct
was
that
they
were
there
without
a
permit
and
there
was
no
ordinance
requiring
that
there'd
be
a
permit,
if
--
and
indeed
no
standards
for
the
grant
of
a
permit
but
the
facts
are
somewhat
analogous.
now,
there
is
a
contention
that
because
children
were
going
to
be
at
this
park
in
half
an
hour,
perhaps
this
is
a
circumstance
from
which
you
can
infer
a
breach
of
the
peace.
there's
no
evidence
to
indicate
that
the
petitioners
knew
the
children
would
be
there
in
a
half
an
hour.
when
they
asked
the
officer
by
what
authority
--
i
think
i
will
read
that
testimony.
one
of
the
--
i
don't
know
which
one
it
was,
this
is
thompson
testifying.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
middle
of
page
40.
he
says,
“one
of
the
--
i
don't
know
which
one
it
was,
came
up
and
asked
me,
who
gave
me
orders
to
come
out
there
and
by
what
authority
i
came
out
there.
and
i
told
them
that
i
didn't
need
any
orders
to
come
out
there.”
you
can
translate
that
testimony
about
you
can
imagine
what
that
officer
really
said.
the
--
but
his
own
version
of
it
is
that
he
didn't
--
he
told
that
this
--
he
didn't
need
any
orders
to
come
out
there
and
order
them
off.
well
the
point
of
this
is
that
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
--
i
think
my
argument
is
the
same
whichever
way
you
look
at
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
we
can
assume
that
a
negro
going
on
to
a
customarily
white
basketball
court
in
savannah,
georgia
is
engaging
in
nonconformance
conduct
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
right.
but
to
me,
that
doesn't
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
right.
now
--
and
to
finish
that,
that
the
officers
never
connected.
they're
orders
that
lead
to
this
problem
of
--
that
the
park
was
for
children
or
to
the
half
hour
period.
actually,
half
hour
is
a
pretty
good
period
to
engage
in
a
basketball
game
especially
when
you
get
up
around
30
years
old.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
