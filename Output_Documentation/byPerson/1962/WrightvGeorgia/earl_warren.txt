number
68,
nathaniel
wright,
et
al.,
petitioners,
versus
georgia.
mr.
nabrit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
any
rules
presented
to
the
court
in
this
case,
any
written
rules?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
garfunkel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
those
issues
without
those
issues
with
that
--
those
issues
be
before
us
to
determine?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
against
the
rule?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who's
--
whose
witness
was
this
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
aren't
you
bound
by
his
cross-examination?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
--
and
then
he
also
said
that
he
didn't
know
whether
it
was
schedule
--
anything
scheduled
or
not,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
these
people
were
--
had
been
white
people,
would
you
have
put
in
your
question
as
you
read
it
to
us
the
fact
that
this
was
in
a
predominantly
white
neighbor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
say
that
the
predominant
reason
for
the
arrest
was
other
than
--
than
because
they
were
negroes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
to
the
extent
that
--
that
he
was
motivated
by
the
fact
that
they
were
negroes,
the
arrest
would
be
illegal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
you
--
you
say
the
other
is
the
overriding
reason.
i
understood
mr.
nabrit
to
say
that
one
of
these
officers
testified
that
they
didn't
know
anything
about
the
rules,
they
didn't
know
had
any
rules
and
they
know
what
they
were,
and
that
he
didn't,
in
effect,
that
he
didn't
arrest
them
because
of
the
violation
of
the
rules.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
was
there
--
is
that
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
didn't
know
there
were
any
rules
against
anybody
being
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
did
he
say
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
within
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
also
says,
“i
don't
have
any
knowledge
to
myself,
if
any
certain
age
group
is
limited
to
any
particular
basketball
court,
i
don't
know
the
rules
of
the
city
recreation
district.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
still
he
--
he
arrested
them
presumably
for
a
violation
of
those
rules
plus
the
fact
that
they
were
negroes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
if
they
weren't
doing
anything
illegal,
if
he
had
no
knowledge
of
them
violating
any
rules,
then
he
have
the
right
as
a
police
officer
just
to
move
them
along.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
he
have
that
right
as
a
police
officer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
true.
what
if
--
if
these
people
were
doing
nothing
out
of
the
way
which
he
--
which
he
said.
he
said
that
they
were
just
playing
--
they're
just
playing
there
and
doing
nothing
else
and
if
that
is
true.
and
if
it's
true
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
violation
of
any
rules
of
the
park,
what
is
there
in
this
case
to
indicate
that
these
people
were
doing
something
unlawful
for
which
they
could
be
moved
along
by
a
police
officer
without
an
order?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
a
public
park.
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
they
--
you
admitted
that
they
had
the
right
to
go
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
you?
i
thought
your
opening
statement
was
that
they
had
the
right
to
go
to
that
park.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
mean
that
--
that
although,
you
admit
that
that
you
don't
admit
that
a
negro
had
a
right
to
go
on
that
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
also
told
us
that
you
made
no
point
of
that,
that
they
had
a
right
to
go
there
because
it
was
legal
under
the
rules
of
the
park
where
negroes
or
anybody
could
go
in
that
park.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
schneider,
i
--
i
must
come
back
to
this
--
this
statement.
“i
observed
the
conduct
of
these
people
when
they
were
on
the
basketball
court
and
they
were
doing
nothing
besides
playing
basketball.
they
were
just
normally
playing
basketball
and
none
of
the
children
from
the
schools
were
there
at
that
particular
time.”
now,
what
was
it
--
are
you
going
to
tell
us
that
--
that
because
someone
else
driving
around
that
park
might
get
excited
and
might
do
something
unconstitutional
that
these
people
can
be
put
in
jail
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
not
moving
along
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
took
it
over?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
all
there
was
on
the
playground
just
a
basketball
park?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
rather
large
park.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
has
somebody
asked
you
to
get
out
of
the
public
park
whether
he's
a
police
officer
or
not?
what
would
be
your
question?
wouldn't
you
be
likely
to
ask
him
for
what
reason
or
by
what
authority
he
was
ordering
you
off?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
fact
that
they
went
along
with
him
peaceably
after
he
arrested
them
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
could
be
taken
as
evidence
against
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
later
he
said
they
were
in
there
peacefully,
just
playing
basketball
and
doing
nothing
else,
and
it
would
be
somewhat
irritating
wouldn't
it
to
be
thrown
off
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
basketball
court
or
out
of
the
park.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
think
if
a
man
--
do
you
think
if
an
irish
policeman
came
in
there
and
said,
“get
out
of
here.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that
they
wouldn't
have
a
right
to
say,
“by
what
authority
do
you
do
this?”
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
they
don't
have
$100,
they
go
to
jail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
assistant
general,
very
well.
mr.
nabrit.
