mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
i
should
like
to
state
at
the
beginning
that
the
city
of
georgia
and
we
are
not
city
attorneys;
we're
the
district
attorney's
office.
they
call
us
solicitor
generals
and
i'm
chief
assistant
solicitor
general
in
the
circuit
which
is
savannah.
we
admit
that
this
was
a
city
operated
park.
we
further
admit
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
practice
segregation
in
such
a
park.
we
further
admit
and
feel
that
if
this
statute
was
being
used
in
a
manner
to
preserve
segregation
in
this
park
as
a
centrifuge
to
preserve
segregation,
then
under
the
facts
in
this
case,
this
case
should
be
reversed
and
sent
back
and
the
defendants
acquitted.
however,
we
ask
the
court
to
look
at
the
record
in
this
case
and
study
the
facts
that
were
developed.
as
i
heard
on
the
news
yesterday
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
yes,
sir.
that's
what
i
was
coming
to
now.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
as
i
heard
the
arguments
yesterday,
the
court
several
term
referred
to
the
question
of
what
was
the
policy.
and
as
mr.
nabrit
referred
to
the
park
superintendent
having
testified
in
the
development
of
this
case
on
cross-examination
of
the
--
would
understood
that
the
park
was
being
made
that
these
people
were
arrested
because
they
were
negroes.
it
was,
therefore,
we
put
the
park
superintendent
on
the
stand
to
outline
for
the
jury
and
the
court
below,
and
the
court
of
appeals,
and
when
the
case
came
to
this
court
for
this
court
to
understand
the
policy
of
the
park
playgrounds
in
savannah.
and
i
therefore
would
like
to
refer
to
the
court
to
page
42
of
the
record
which
is
the
testimony
of
the
playground
superintendent,
in
which
he
outlined
the
way
the
parks
were
setup
in
savannah.
he
said,
“we
tried
to
put
them
in
areas,
wide
areas,
and
in
colored
areas,
although,
we
have
several
which
are
now
mixed
areas
park
extensions,
and
wells
park
because
in
certain
areas
the
--
and
they
play
together.”
he
says,
“that
has
occurred
from
time
to
time,
that
colored
children
would
play
in
the
daffin
park
area
and
in
the
park
extension
area
but
no
action
had
been
taken
because
it
is
legal,
it
is
allowed,
and
nobody
has
said
anything
about
it.
“that
is
in
the
middle
of
page
43
of
the
--
of
the
record.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
this
is
mr.
hagan,
the
park
superintendent,
your
honor.
he
said
then
further
on
the
bottom
of
the
page
the
playground
areas,
in
further
explaining,
the
playground
areas
are
basically
for
young
children,
say
15
to
16
and
under
along
that
age
group.
we
give
priorities
to
the
playground
to
the
younger
children
over
the
grownups.
it
made
no
difference
as
to
whether
they
were
white
or
colored.
anytime
that
we
requested
anyone
to
do
something
and
they
refuse,
we
would
ask
the
police
to
stop
--
it
says
stop
and
it's
a
misprint
should
be
step.
if
we
would
ask
them
to
leave
when
they
did
not,
we
would
ask
the
police
to
step
in.
we
have
other
reports
of
colored
children
who
have
played
on
the
park
extension
but
they
were
never
arrested
or
told
to
leave.
he
further
--
he
referred
earlier
at
the
course
that
they
had
played
in
the
daffin
park
area
and
not
been
arrested.
the
facts
in
this
case
showed
that
these
defendants
were
grown
men,
the
youngest
of
which
was
23
years
of
age
and
the
oldest
of
which
was
32
years
of
age.
that
they
went
upon
this
playground
around
1:30
or
2:00
in
the
afternoon
during
a
school
day.at
that
time,
they
were
dressed
not
for
playing
basketball,
but
dressed
more
for
business
purposes,
that
is
they
had
all
the
hard
shoes,
they
had
on
shirts,
jackets,
i
think
some
of
them
might
even
had
ties
on
them,
i'm
not
sure
of
the
police
officer.
well
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
no,
sir.
but
it
was
to
go
into
the
question
of
the
bonafide
as
we
--
the
purpose
of
the
question
of
the
intent.
that
came
into
the
intent
because
the
defendants
constantly
said
they
were
just
merely
there
for
the
purpose
of
playing
basketball.
and
we
said
the
intent
was
not
to
play
basketball
and
although,
they've
denied
this
all
the
way
down
up
to
this
court,
in
their
brief
in
this
court.
they
say
that
perhaps
it
was
not
to
play
basketball
but
to
make
a
profound
nonverbal
expression
against
segregation
in
public
parks.
that's
the
way
they
put
it
so
that
in
order
to
come
into
a
question
of
free
speech.
however,
mr.
hagan
further
along
with
his
testimony,
said
that
he
further
testified
that
if
there
were
conflict
between
the
younger
people
and
the
older
people
using
the
park
facilities,
the
preference
would
be
for
the
younger
people
to
use
them.
but
the
--
we
have
no
objections
to
all
the
people
using
the
facilities
if
there
are
no
younger
people
present
or
if
they
are
not
--
or
if
they
are
not
scheduled
to
be
used
by
the
younger
people.
he
said,
and
this
is
on
further
direct
examination,
“it
has
been
accustomed
to
use
the
park
separately
for
the
different
races
but
i
couldn't
say
whether
or
not
a
permit
would
or
would
not
be
issued
to
a
person
of
color
if
that
person
came
to
my
office
in
the
recreational
department
or
requested
a
permit
to
play
on
the
courts
but
i
don't
have
the
opinion
that
it
would
have
been.
we
have
never
refused
one.
the
request
has
never
been
made.”
in
other
words,
he
says
if
they
came,
we
would
grant
them
but
nobody
has
ever
come
and
asked
and
so
i
can't
say
that
we
have
done
it
because
nobody
has
requested
it.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
i'm
trying
to
come
to
that
right
--
right
now
your
honor.
the
--
further,
i
would
like
to
give
--
to
go
on
to
mr.
hagan's
point
because
then
i'll
come
back
to
the
actual
facts.
on
school
days
and
this
was
a
school
day,
these
courts
and
the
playground
area
are
at
--
at
daffin
park
are
available
for
only
certain
age
groups
and
they
are
only
used
at
that
time
of
day
by
the
schools
in
that
vicinity.
it
is
more
or
less
left
available
for
them.
that
is
the
way
we
have
our
recreation
set
up.
in
other
words,
at
this
time,
this
park,
this
playground,
was
reserved
--
i
think
the
evidence
shows
that
there
were
two
schools
right
across
the
street,
was
reserved
for
the
use
of
these
schools.
and
he
further
said
that
all
during
the
day,
these
people
came
from
the
various
schools
to
play
not
just
during
recess
but
they
had
physical
education
activities
in
which
they
would
come
out
and
play
on
these
playgrounds.
and
that
all
during
the
day,
this
particular
moment,
they
might
not
be
there.
they
would
be
--
momentarily
they
might
come
in
the
next
five
minutes
and
a
policeman
knew
definitely
that
the
school
would
be
out
at
2:30,
and
at
that
time,
he
knew
the
children
would
be
coming
across
to
play
on
the
playground.
and
that
this
was
--
and
this
policeman
so
testified
in
court
that
he
knew
these
children
were
coming.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
yes,
sir.
this
was
all
evidence
that
went
before
the
jury.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
mr.
justice
black,
in
the
georgia
procedure,
we
have
what
is
known
and
colloquially
as
what
as
known
as
the
dumb
act.
and
that
is
that
the
judge
is
not
able
to
comment
on
the
evidence.
he
cannot
comment
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
evidence.
he
merely
charges
the
jury
on
the
law.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
well
the
rule
know
what
they
had
violated
with
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
they
had
violated
--
no.
what
he
charged
them
was
that
they
had
violated
the
order
of
the
police
officer.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
is
it
your
--
is
the
general
verdict,
it
is
only
a
general
verdict.
there's
no
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
the
state
attempt
to
prove
its
case
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
no,
the
court
did
not
go
into
detail
as
to
whether
it
violated
the
rule.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
no,
he
did
not.
he
mentioned
in
the
--
only
that
they
were
charged
with
going
on
the
purpose
and
this
was
the
question
of
whether
this
was
an
intent
to
disturb
the
peace.
all
of
these
were
taken
into
consideration.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
of
the
trial
judge.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
the
usual
trial
--
the
judges
and
the
courts
below
of
the
georgia
courts.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
they
were
not
charged
with
doing
something
unlawful
your
honor.
they
were
charged
with
going
on
the
playgrounds
for
the
purpose
of
disturbing
the
peace.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
no,
sir.
no.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
disturbing
the
peace,
there
was
nothing
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
not
in
detail,
your
honor.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
he
charged
them,
and
i'll
have
to
get
his
charge
sir.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
not
generic.
this
is
the
key
and
this
is
the
statute
of
the
way
we
were
arguing
it
to
the
court.
the
statute
becomes
violated
not
by
disturbing
the
peace
but
by
two
or
more
people
assembling
for
the
purpose
of
disturbing
the
peace.
not
of
the
purpose
that
the
peace
has
to
be
disturbed
but
assembling
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
but
it
became
unlawful
when
they
refuse
to
obey
the
police
officer's
request
to
leave.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
so
then
it's
up
to
the
jury
to
so
determine
and
in
fact
have
to
find
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
if
they
thought
that
the
policeman
was
correct.
now
the
--
that
question
has
not
been
raised
very
much
but
the
recent
case
that
is
very
interesting
from
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york,
people
versus
galvin.
and
in
that
case,
one
of
those
--
one
of
the
million
cases,
mr.
(inaudible)
galvin
was
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
reference
is
made
under
my
brief.
i
won't
cite
the
citation.
and
he
had
come
out
of
arrest
and
he
was
standing
on
the
sidewalk
talking
to
some
friends
of
his.
and
a
policeman
came
along
and
said,
“would
you
please
move.”
and
he
says,
“i
don't
have
to
move.
i'm
on
the
public
sidewalk.”
and
the
policeman
arrested
him
for
somewhat
--
under
somewhat
the
most
statute
in
the
state
of
new
york.
this
--
he
was
convicted.
this
went
all
the
way
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
and
they
were
faced
with
somewhat
to
some
of
them
because
there,
he
says,
he
was
probably
on
the
sidewalk.
and
the
court
said
that
the
policeman
had
a
right
to
believe
that
they
might
block
the
sidewalk.
and
as
the
policeman
felt
in
his
mind
and
he
may
bona
fide
made
a
request.
in
his
mind
that
there
was
at
that
chance,
that
refusing
to
obey
the
police
officer
at
that
time
could
then
may
very
well
be
--
was
a
disturbance
of
the
police
peace
for
which
the
jury
or
the
judge
sitting
as
a
jury
could
convict
him.
and
they
affirmed
his
conviction.
and
the
record
showed
that
there
was
no
disorder
that
was
all
talked
very
friendly,
there
were
no
harsh
words
or
anything
else.
it
was
just
a
request
made
by
a
policeman.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
and
that
then
we
have
the
further
question
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
construing
its
statute
in
which
i
think
this
court
held
in
garner
versus
louisiana,
that
it
was
up
to
the
court,
highest
court,
to
construe
the
meaning
of
its
own
statute
and
when
it
was
violated.
the
question
that
i
see
would
be
presented
to
this
court
would
be
two;
first,
was
the
statute
used
as
a
veil
to
preserve
segregation?
and
second,
was
there
any
evidence
whatsoever
to
justify
the
police
officer
to
believe
that
the
breach
of
the
peace
was
eminent
or
might
happen
to
cause
him
to
ask
and
to
leave?
was
he
bona
fide
in
asking
them
to
leave?
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
that's
right.
yes
sir.
i'm
glad,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
you
brought
that
up
because
there
are
several
issues.
first
that
these
children
were
there,
whether
they
were
coming
and
they
expected
them
there,
he
testified,
officer
hillers
testified
and
that
is
on
the
record
or
rather
officer
thompson,
i
believe
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
right.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
that
is
true.
but
your
honor
at
what
point
was
it
being
necessary
for
him
to
tell
them
to
leave
this
playground.
under
the
rules
of
the
playground
commission,
the
playground
was
available
for
these
school
children
all
during
the
day.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
but
early
above
that
your
honor
he
said,
when
he
was
--
this
was
an
answer
to
a
hypothetical
question.
and
that
this
is
the
total
answer.
if
your
plan
program
did
not
have
the
23rd
of
january,
1961,
set
aside
for
any
particular
activity,
would
it
have
been
permissible
to
use
this
basketball
court
in
daffin
park
in
the
absence
of
children?
and
his
answer
said,
“well,
i
can't
very
well
answer
that
question
because
you
have
several
questions
in
one.
first,
i
would
like
to
say
that
normally
we
would
not
schedule
anything
for
that
time
of
the
day
because
of
the
school's
using
the
total
area
there,”
so
that
at
that
time,
it
was
reserved
according
to
the
first
part
of
his
testimony.
then
in
going
to
try
and
help
the
--
answering
this
hypothetical
question,
he
said,
“if
we
had
not
had
something
scheduled
at
that
time
of
the
day,
then
we
would
have
granted
information.”
but
at
that
time
the
total
area
was
reserved
for
the
school
children.
now
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
this
man
was
the
state's
witness
when
the
defense
started
to
develop
the
fact
that
they
were
arrested
solely
because
of
the
fact
that
they
were
negroes.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
yes,
sir.
but
this
--
this
was
the
all
answer.
this
--
to
what
mr.
justice
goldberg
asked
me
was.
he
said
don't
give
me
the
quote
of
the
last
part.
and
this
was
the
first
part
of
the
answer
to
the
same
question
that
had
been
asked.
in
other
words,
this
answer
goes
on
for
almost
half
of
page.
and
he
said
at
the
first
that,
“at
that
time
of
day,
this
playground
was
reserved
for
the
schools.”
then
in
going
along
further,
they
said,
“you
have
to
ask
him
several
questions
in
one
if
they
have
not
been
reserved.”
he
said,
“if
all
that
basketball
court
was
not
scheduled,
it
would
be
compatible
with
our
program
for
them
to
use
it,
and
we
would
not
mind
them
using
it.
and
if
there
was
a
permanent
issue,
there
would
be
no
objections
as
to
race,
creed,
or
color.
in
other
words,
that
is
the
last
part
of
the
answer.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
he
says,
“we
never
know
when
they
are
coming
in
one
part.
that
is
the
parochial
schools
use
it
during
recess
and
lunch
breaks
and
also
for
sport.
as
also
the
lutherans
schools
and
the
public
schools
bring
their
students
out
there
by
bus
in
various
times
during
school
hours
all
day
long.
we
never
know
when
they
are
coming
and
they
use
kent
park
the
same
way.”
and
i
might
add
now
kent
park
is
a
park
area
in
the
colored
section.
and
i
think
what
the
interpretation
of
his
answer
is
that
he
personally
doesn't
know
if
the
schools
are
going
to
bring
somebody
around
there
at
ten
o'clock,
at
twelve
o'clock,
or
one
o'clock.
but
as
far
as
the
playground
as
far
as
the
playground
department
is
concerned,
those
playgrounds
are
exclusively
for
the
use
of
the
schools
during
those
hours
or
whenever
they
want
to
use
it.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
that
is
correct
sir.
there
was
no
printed
regulation
and
there
was
no
--
and
what
we
state
this,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
the
going
or
merely
going
upon
the
park
grounds
and
playing
the
basketball
is
not
criminal.
and
if
they
had
walked
up,
the
policeman
had
walked
up
to
him
and
said,
“i
am
arresting
you.
you
are
--
and
we'll
let
you
argue
with
the
misdemeanor”
is
a
basic
unfairness
in
such
a
statute
because
obviously
no
one
would
know
that
he
has
violated
or
was
violating
something.
but
it
becomes
--
the
fairness
in
this
is
that
it
does
not
become
a
misdemeanor
until
he
is
asked
to
leave
and
refuses
to
leave
and
asked
to
leave
by
a
peace
officer
who
is
a
policeman
wearing
a
--
a
police
officer
wearing
a
uniform.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
the
police
officer
didn't
actually
tell
them
that
while
you
are
here
legally
and
properly
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
because
the
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
no,
i
think
the
superintendent
said
if
they
hadn't
been
scheduled
but
at
that
time
they
just
played
there,
they
would
not
have
been
allowed
to
play.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
well,
there's
no
printed
regulation
but
there's
a
regulation
of
the
park.
i
mean
that's
the
way
they
regulate
the
parks.
if
he
want
--
we
will
put
it
if
that's
the
way
the
park
superintendent
regulates
the
park.
now,
if
you
--
if
they
had
printed,
if
you're
saying
are
there
printed
regulations
and
posted
and
all
of
that,
i
would
say,
no,
but
there
is
this
regulation
in
the
sense
that
that
is
the
way
the
parks
are
run.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
yes,
sir.
the
disturbance
of
the
peace
out
of
these
circumstances,
your
honor,
was
that
they
were
had
gone
there,
we
feel,
and
to
think
the
record
shows
because
they
went
there
that
to
what
they
thought
was
to
test
segregation.
the
police
officer
said,
“i
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
no,
sir.
it's
not
illegal.
but
the
police
officer
said
on
other
occasions,
“i
have
seen
colored
children
in
daffin
park
and
i
have
not
arrested
them
because
i
--
but
in
these
circumstances
i
did.”
now,
i
think
what
we
are
faced
with
is,
the
police
officer
was
exercising
a
question
of
judgment.
what
did
he
--
did
he
bonafidely
feel
that
there
could
be
a
disturbance
of
the
peace.
now,
not
that
they
were
disturbing
the
peace
but
by
their
actions
caused
others
to
disturb
the
peace
and
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
yes,
sir.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
yes,
sir.
i
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
that
is
the
--
if
that
was
the
overriding
consideration
for
the
men's
arrest,
i
would
say
that
this
case
should
be
reversed.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
if
i'm
going
--
the
question
as
to
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
yes,
sir.
the
question
present
wouldn't
in
the
--
by
in
the
briefs.
the
question
presented
by
the
petitioner
and
the
way
the
question
is
presented
by
the
respondent
expressly
states
that
because
in
--
in
our
brief,
we
have
put
the
question
in
this
manner
and
we
feel
that
the
evidence
shows
it.
whether
the
conviction
of
petitions
for
unlawful
assembly
denied
them
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
they
were
convicted
on
evidence
which
showed
that
they
were
grown
negro
men,
who
took
over
a
playground
in
a
predominantly
white
neighborhood,
at
the
time
when
the
playground
was
reserved
for
and
was
to
be
used
by
school
children,
and
they
refused
to
leave
when
requested
by
the
police.
now,
the
reason
he
said
he
asked
them
to
leave
was
because
he
expected
the
children.
now,
they
say
that
children
--
he
said
he
knew
the
children
will
be
there
by
2:30.
he
knew
they
were
going
to
be
there
by
2:30.
they
could
have
come
earlier.
he
asked
them
to
leave.
now,
here
we
are
in
a
predominantly
white
area
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
your
honor,
because
they
asked
the
question
of
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
yes.
he
said
that
they
asked
on
cross-examination.
it
was
one
of
the
reasons
you
arrested
them
because
they
were
negro.
and
he
said
partly,
one
of
the
reasons
was
but
the
overriding
reason
that
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
because
the
evidence
showed
it
was
in
a
predominantly
white
area
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
because
it
was
part
of
the
thing
that
he
was
felt
--
he
felt
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
no,
sir.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
we
would
--
because
the
question
was
asked
the
police
officer.
and
we
said
--
and
that
was
on
cross-examination.
if
this
had
been
white
adult
man,
they
would
still
have
been
asked
to
leave.
but
the
fact
that
they
were
negro
added
to
the
fear
of
the
police
officer,
that
here
they
were
on
a
playground
at
that
time
was
reserved
for
these
children.
and
the
park
superintendent
says,
“we
keep
them
separate
as
to
groups
because
it's
not
good
park
policy
to
have
grown
people
on
a
playground
which
is
reserved
for
children.”
he
says,
“we
don't
want
it.”
and
that
is
in
the
record.
now,
here
with
these
people
in
--
who
if
they
had
been
adult
white
men
would
still
have
been
requested
to
leave?
but
the
question
on
cross-examination
was
asked
said,
“well
what's
part
of
the
reason,
was
it
read
this
as
partly.”
well
of
course
in
the
policeman's
eyes,
it's
a
fact
i
can't
deny
it,
that
the
fact
that
they
had
been
therefore
to
--
were
asked
to
leave
that
there
was
a
further
chance
of
a
disturbance
of
the
peace
because
of
the
fact
that
they
were
negro.
that
was
merely
--
that
is
not
the
overriding
consideration.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
which
one
sir?
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
no,
sir.
that
would
not
have
been
sufficient
and
if
that
was
the
overriding
reason,
i
would
say
this
case
should
be
reversed.
but
the
overriding
reason
had
not
--
color
had
nothing
to
do.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
that
now
--
that
is
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
we
feel
that
if
the
fact
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
police
officer
says,
if
there
is
a
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
yes.
if
there
is
a
legitimate
reason,
reverse
it.
if
there
is
a
legitimate
reason
for
the
police
officer
to
ask
them
to
leave
without
regard
to
color,
the
fact
that
color
might
incidentally
be
part
should
not
say
that
you
would
not
be
guilty.
for
instance,
suppose
white
adult
men
went
on
the
playground
and
they
ask
him
to
leave
and
this
case
came
up
on
the
record
of
the
same
type
that
they
went
there
and
played
the
same
way.
then,
it
would
be
fact
that
these
people
were
white
not
would
that
mean
that
they
should
be
acquitted
when
colored
in
the
same
category
would
be
--
would
be
convicted
with
color
from
the
same
category
would
be
convicted
--
would
be
acquitted.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
no,
sir.
i
would
not.
the
only
reason
i
mention
that
was
because
in
the
record
it
shows
on
cross-examination
to
the
--
in
our
answer
to
one
of
the
defense
attorney's
lawyer
--
lawyers
that
--
one
of
the
defense
attorneys,
was
one
of
the
reasons
you
asked
that
you
arrested
them
because
they
were
negro
or
why
--
“did
you
arrest
them
because
they
were
negro?”
and
in
response
to
that
question,
he
said,
“yes”,
and
that
was
what
we
put
on
the
question
because
it
was
--
it
had
been
--
it
had
been
put
into
the
case
by
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
because
the
facts
that
the
state
proved
showed
that
colored
children
had
played
in
that
park
on
other
times
and
never
been
arrested.
the
te
--
undisputed
testimony
of
the
park
superintendent
was
that
there
was
--
that
they
had
a
right
to
play
and
it
was
legal.
that
the
park
superintendent
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
colored
children
had
played
in
that
park
and
not
been
arrested.
the
arresting
officer
himself
testified
that
he
had
seen
colored
children
playing
in
that
park
and
they
had
not
been
arrested.
so
that
in
this
instance,
i
would
now
say
one
swallow
wouldn't
make
a
summer.
one
arrest
of
these
people
does
not
show
quite
a
program
of
such
segregation
but
there's
this
feeling
that
this
would
be
a
legitimate
area
of
inquiry
by
this
court
and
by
any
of
the
high
appellant
courts.
we,
the
state
showed
in
its
--
by
putting
this
that
this
was
not
the
reason
because
if
it
were
the
reason
--
if
this
were
the
true
reason,
then
it
will
also
have
been
applicable
to
all
of
the
other
instances
and
they
should
have
been
arrested
to
show
that.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
if
that
was
the
sole
--
if
that
was
the
proper
overriding
reason.
by
that
i
mean
if
that
was
his
motivating
reason.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
he
arrested
them.
he
said
because
in
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
that
is
correct
in
this
respect
that
he
didn't
know
about
the
rules
of
the
park
but
he
did
know
of
the
facts
that
the
children
would
be
there.
he
knew
that
everyday,
he
arrives
this
street
and
he
knew
that
everyday
these
children
came
out
and
played
in
the
park
during
recess
as
he
put
it
which
was
probably
during
their
physical
education
or
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
no,
sir.
he
knew
that
that
park
was
reserved
for
those
children.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
he
says
that
that
“i
knew
that
within
half
an
hour
in
the
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
officer
hillers
or
officer
thompson.
“under
ordinary
circumstances,
i
would
not
arrest
boys
playing
basketball
on
a
public
park.
i
made
this
arrest
around
2:00
and
the
school
is
that
around
2:30
and
i
would
have
been
at
least
30
minutes
before
the
children.”
well,
that
was
in
cross-examination
but
the
children
from
the
schools
--
it's
page
40,
middle
of
the
page,
“the
children
from
the
schools
would
have
been
out
there
shortly
after
that.
the
purpose
of
asking
them
to
leave
was
to
keep
down
trouble
which
looked
to
me
like
it
might
start”,
and
up
to
top.
“there's
a
school
nearby
this
basketball
court.
it
is
located
at
washington
avenue
in
bee
road,
i
mean,
at
washington
avenue
in
waters
which
is
just
across
the
street.
there's
another
school
on
44th
street.
there
are
two
schools
nearby.
i
believe
that
they
are
both
drama
schools.
i
patrol
that
area
and
the
children
from
these
schools
play
there.
they
come
there
everyday,
i
believe.
i
believe
they
come
there
after
--
afternoon
when
they
get
out
of
school
and
i
believe
they
come
there
during
recess.”
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
that's
right.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
no.
he
arrested
them
your
honor
for
them
failing
to
leave
when
he
made
this
request.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
that
is
the
--
well
that
is
the
main
issue
as
we
see
in
this
case.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
we
feel
as
a
police
officer,
he
has
the
right
to
ascertain
from
the
facts
that
he
can
tell
from
what's
happening
to
determine
whether
he
should
make
a
request
to
leave.
that
it's
a
question
of
judgment
that
there
might
be
a
question
whether
if
you
or
i
or
someone
else
was
there
whether
we
think
that
we
should
have
asked
them
to
leave.
but
when
the
police
officer
acting
on
the
best
available
evidence
the
way
he
observes
it,
makes
this
request
to
leave.
that
if
there
is
any
evidence
whatsoever
to
sustain
him
to
show
that
this
was
a
bona
fide
request
that
he
was
trying
to
keep
down
good
order
in
the
parks.
that
then
that
should
be
obeyed
and
that
he
would
fairly
to
obey
it,
you're
doing
it
as
your
peril
where
you
might
be
right
and
you
might
be
wrong.
in
other
words,
you
say,
“i
did
leave
and
i
was
right”
just
like
some
types
of
answers,
go
ahead
and
violate
that
law,
it's
unconstitutional.
you
violated
at
your
peril
and
i
think
that
when
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
we
were
not
charging
them
we're
doing
something
unlawful,
your
honor.
we
were
charging
them
with
going
upon
the
parks
for
the
purpose
of
disturbing
the
peace
and
in
that
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
the
--
they
have
to
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
we
said
they
have
--
if
the
--
if
this
arrest
was
used
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
segregation
in
the
park,
we
say
that
it
should
be
reversed.
we
further
state
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
no.
i
--
the
negro
had
a
right
to
go
on
that
court
but
not
for
the
purpose
which
they
went
on.
in
other
words,
they
went
on
to
see
if
what
will
happen.
they
went
on
to
see
if
they
can
play.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
and
as
they
--
at
the
time
of
day,
what
is
that
sir?
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
no,
sir.
i
said
that
--
no,
sir.
i
said
that
was
the
--
they
have
--
it
was
--
i
admit
that
if
there's
no
--
there's
no
park
segregation
but
you
do
not
have
a
right
to
go
on
to
the
park
when
the
park
is
reserved
for
others
and
you're
requested
to
leave.
and
we
see
the
purpose
is
when
they
went
on
to
this
playground
for
the
purpose
of
disturbing
the
peace
not
by
their
actions
but
by
the
reaction
that
they
could
get
from
the
people
around
there.
that
if
they
had
actually
gone
upon
that
park
to
play
basketball,
they
would
have
acted
in
a
different
manner.
that
these
were
grown
man,
23
to
32
years
of
age
and
they
went
on
with
the
purpose
of
seeing
not
of
their
actions
but
the
reaction
and
part
of
the
--
part
of
the
disturbance
of
the
peace
as
we
understand
in
our
brief.
in
our
brief
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
we
have
dealt
very
extensively
with
that
and
that
was
made
a
part
of
this
record.
and
part
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
but
these,
that
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
the
unconstitutionality
was
not
because
at
this
time,
this
park
was
a
well-known
public
playground
that
people
riding
around
and
we
presume
new
that
those
children
were
coming
because
they'd
come
there
everyday
during
school
hours,
and
now
here
were
these
men
who
had
come
on
this
park
at
this
time
when
these
children
were
generally
there
and
they
took
it
over.
and
we
say
that
this
was
a
reaction
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
well,
they
took
over
the
playground.
there
was
nobody
else.
the
play
--
certainly
the
school
teachers
or
the
children
would
not
want
to
go
on
a
playground.
they
would
not
--
not
--
might
want
to
go
there
but
you
--
you
would
not
want
them
to
go
on
the
playground.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
no,
there's
the
--
the
record
does
not
show
it
but
i
can
state
that
there's
swing
and
slides,
there's
a
playground
area.
that's
a
very
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
it's
a
very
large
--
it's
a
very
--
the
--
it's
a
large
park
but
the
playground
area
is
small.
the
playground
area
is
at
one
end
of
the
park.
the
rest
of
the
park
is
devoted
for
other
purposes.
and
the
playground
area
is
immediately
across
the
street
from
these
schools.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
no,
sir.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
no.
such
a
statute
would
certainly
be
unconstitutional
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
--
part
of
it
was
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
the
court
embraced
the
fact
that
they
were
colored.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
it
--
the
statute
--
the
question
of
the
colored
with
what
as
if
we're
going
into
what
is
in
the
mind
of
the
police
officer
as
to
why
he
asked
them
to
leave.
he
said
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
no.
he
said
first
originally,
“i
arrested
them
because
i
was
afraid
of
what
might
happen.
children
were
expected
on
the
playground
within
a
certain
--
by
2:30.”
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
the
police
officer
on
cross-examination.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
yes.
came
back
on
cross-examination
and
said,
i
was
one
of
the
reasons
or
it
was
the
reason
that
you
arrested
him
because
they
were
colored,
he
said,
“well
part”.
but
that
was
not
the
reason
that
he
yield.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
statute
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
that's
right.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
but
then
the
state
of
georgia
is
not
that
is
why
we
went
into
the
other
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
yes.
that
is
why
we
--
yes.
but
i'm
talking
about
that
that
is
though
in
the
record
honestly,
your
honor.
so
that
is
why
we
went
in
to
the
other
issues
to
show
that
under
similar
circumstances
where
there
were
children
who
were
colored,
they
were
not
asked
to
leave
or
not
arrested.
that
they
--
because
of
the
fact
that
to
show
that
the
reason
for
the
arrest
was
not
override
--
primarily
because
they
were
colored,
the
reason
for
the
arrest
was
because
they
were
grown
men.
if
they
had
been
children
and
they
would
not
have
been
arrested.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
that
is
exactly
what
i
said
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
that
is
exactly
what
i've
said
so
that
we
were
trying
to
show
to
the
court
and
to
the
jury
by
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
that
in
other
circumstances,
colored
children
had
been
allowed
to
play
on
this
playground,
had
not
been
arrested.
so
that
this
would
differentiate
and
show
that
color
was
not
and
at
the
same
police
officer
said
that
he
had
seen
colored
children
playing
out
on
this
playground
and
had
not
arrested
and
ask
them
to
move.
but
he
said,
“but
this
was
different.
these
were
grown
men
and
this
playground
at
that
time
was
designed,
was
set
aside,
and
i
knew
the
children
were
coming.”
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
then
i
think
if
the
defense
would
have
shown
that
that
had
been
abused
for
a
purpose
that
they
were
only
applied
to
colored
grown
men,
i
think
it
would
have
been
a
valid
defense
and
they
should
have
been
acquitted.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
no
evidence
was
introduced
by
the
defendants.
the
only
witnesses
were
witnesses
by
the
state.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
well,
you
go
to
the
fact
that,
your
honor,
puts
the
question
to
me
if
they
just
arrested
--
didn't
arrest
any
white
people
or
white
men.
i
might
say
that
nobody
has
been
arrested,
no
colored
man
has
been
arrested,
or
no
colored
children
had
been
arrested
under
this
statute,
and
we
have
had
no
further
difficulty
on
this
question.
this
is
the
sole
arrest
that
was
made.
colored
children
had
played
on
the
parks
and
grown
colored
men
had
played
on
the
parks
during
the
afternoons
after
school
hours.
i
don't
know
if
they
play
in
daffin
park
so
much
because
it's
--
as
i
say,
it's
further
away
from
the
colored
area,
but
they
do
play
quite
extensively
in
park
extension
which
is
in
the
middle
of
the
mixed
area.
and
every
afternoon,
they're
out
there
playing.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
i
would
say
that
the
jury
had
a
right
to
find
the
man
guilty
because
of
the
fact
that
he
was
--
the
overriding
purpose
was
not
--
whether
the
statute
was
not
being
used
as
a
--
as
a
cloak
to
preserve
segregation
and
it
was
not
being
used
as
a
cloak
to
serve
--
to
preserve
segregation,
then
we
feel
that
it
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
the
petitioners
did
not
actually
ask
it.
the
petitioners
--
he
went
up
to
the
petitioners
and
said,
asked
them
to
leave
but
they
said,
“by
what
authority
do
you
get
here”,
in
a
very
sarcastic
manner.
and
that
was
all.
they
did
not
ask
why.
i
think
if
they
had
asked
why
they
would
be
entitled
to
be
given
a
reason.
but
the
evidence
of
the
officer
says,
he
said,
“by
what
reason?”
he
said,
“well
i
--
by
what
authority”
and
then
he
said,
“well,
i'm
going
to
have
to
ask
you
to
leave
and
if
you
don't
leave,”
he
says,
and
they
just
piled
into
his
police
car
that
he
had
--
that
there
were
seven
of
them,
he
had
to
ask
them
to
get
out
and
wait
until
the
cruiser
because
it
couldn't
carry
them
all.
he
said
they
look
like
--
the
testimony
of
the
officer
said,
“they
look
like
they
were
waiting
to
be
arrested.”
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
i
think
that
would
be
by
what
authority,
but
he
said
he
put
it
in
the
way
of
what
authority
because
the
police
--
he
put
it
--
he
did
not
--
he
put
it
by
what
authority
but
he
did
not
ask
the
question
why
are
you
asking
me
to
leave
or
why
are
you
asking
us
to
leave?
they
were
merely
--
supposedly
we
said
they're
ready
to
be
arrested
the
way
from
the
--
the
way
the
police
officer
said.
they
went
on
that
park
ground.
they
played
when
a
police
officer
came
up
and
ask
them
to
leave.
and
he
says
if
they
don't
leave,
they
said,
“by
what
authority?”
and
then
he
says,
“i'm
going
to
have
to
arrest
you”
and
says,
they
just
piled
right
in
there
and
that
is
in
the
record.
the
police
officer
it
looked
like
to
him.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
no,
not
a
question
of
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
no.
not
a
question
that
they
went
along
peaceably,
your
honor.
but
that
they
practically
anticipated
it.
that's
the
point
i'm
getting
at.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
our
state
--
i
think
the
police
officers
in
uniform
and
the
police
officer
has
a
right
to
arrest
a
man
for
--
for
committing
an
offense
in
his
presence.
of
course,
this
became
an
offense
when
he
asked
to
leave
and
they
didn't.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
it
doesn't
state
whether
you
have
to
tell
the
man
why
at
that
time.
i
mean,
it
was
perfectly
obvious
what
was
going
on.
i
think
if
you
were
to
be
the
man
and
say,
“i'm
going
to
arrest
you”,
the
man
will
say,
“well
what's
my
arrest?”
he
would
tell
him
what
i
think
the
normal
person
would
ordinarily
say
“why
are
you
arresting?”
i
think
if
i
were
some
policeman
say,
he
was
going
to
arrest
me
the
first
question
i'd
ask
him
was
why
and
i
wouldn't
probably
say
by
what
authority
because
i
think
this
authority
is
uniform.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
yes.
but
i
think
authority
means
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
if
he
is
questioning
the
arrest,
if
he
is
questioning
and
suppose,
and
i'm
talking
about
the
questioning
the
reasons
for
the
arrest.
now,
if
a
man
in
--
if
i
were
in
plain
clothes
and
i
were
a
detective
and
i
said
to
a
man,
“you're
under
arrest.”
he
might
want
to
know
by
what
authority
that
i
have
to
arrest
him.
but
he
was
a
man
in
his
uniform
and
the
record
shows
that
he
was
in
his
own
uniform
as
a
police
officer.
now
he
says,
“i'm
going
to
have
to
ask
you
to
leave.”
and
they
say,
“by
what
authority
do
you
come
out
here
to
tell
us
such.”
then
he
said,
if
he
has
said,
“why”
and
the
police
officer
said,
“well,
there
are
going
to
be
children
out
here
on
this
playground
in
a
few
minutes,
and
we're
asking
you
to
leave
to
let
them
come
out
here.”
i
think
it
would
have
been
a
legitimate
question
for
why
and
i
think
the
policeman
ultimate
them
a
duty
to
tell
them
why.
but
they
didn't
go
that
far.
as
soon
as
he
said,
“i'm
going
to
have
to
arrest
you”,
they
immediately
piled
into
the
car.
and
that
was
why
he
said
that
they
--
they
anticipated
all
of
these.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
i
think
your
honor
that
the
record
will
show
that
most
of
the
-
the
record
shows
most
of
the
sarcasm
or
all
the
sarcasm
was
on
the
part
of
the
defendants.
there's
no
record
and
thing
to
show
that
the
policeman
did
not
act
in
a
polite
or
courteous
manner
to
these
men.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
yes,
sir.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
he
says
that
that
“one
of
them
sarcastically
asked
me.”
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
yes,
sir.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
i
don't
know
exactly
what
i
mean.
all
i
know
is
that
that's
what
the
witness
testified
to
your
honor.
on
that
point,
that
the
witness
was
given.
it's
his
opinion.
one
of
them
said
sarcastically.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
but
your
honor
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
--
let's
see,
it
is
the
reaction
that
hurts
that
the
--
to
come
to
such
order.
it
would
hurt
me
a
lot
of
things
to
be
thrown
out
of
anyway
too.
but
it's
the
reaction
that's
call.
for
instance,
let's
use
another
example
because
i
see
it's
very
hard
to
realize
that
what
we
are
saying
is
not
their
actions
but
it's
the
reaction
that
arises
from
their
actions.
let
us
take
this.
i'm
jewish.
i'm
a
member
of
the
orthodox
faith.
now,
there's
a
big
difference
between
the
conservatives
and
the
orthodox.
the
main
difference
isn't
seen
mixed
seating
--
in
orthodox
you
have
separate
seating
and
conservative
you
mixed
seating.
and
i'll
just
say
we
have
an
orthodox
synagogue
and
they're
having
services
on
saturday
and
a
member
of
the
synagogue
is
one
of
the
things
they
should
have
mixed
seating.
so
on
a
saturday
morning,
he
comes
dressed
with
his
wife
and
they
go
down
and
sit
in
the
middle
of
the
synagogue
peaceably
without
doing
anything,
asking
for
--
for
prayer
here,
and
want
to
engage
in
prayers
in
there.
they're
not
doing
anything
unlawful.
they're
not
disturbing
the
peace
per
se.
but
i
believe
that
you
would
have
a
tremendous
reaction
in
a
truly
orthodox
synagogue
by
these
people
so
sitting
in
the
section
reserved
exclusively
for
men.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
i
think
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
i
think
if
they
asked,
“by
what
authority”,
well
i
think
--
by
what
authority
they
ask
to
come
in,
and
i
think
if
he
said,
“by
the
authority
of
my
uniform”,
i
think
they
would
be
required
to
go.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
yes,
sir.
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
fine
somebody.
the
fines
where
you
would
notice
were
$100
well,
six
of
them
--
five
of
them
were
$125
for
the
six
and
it
was
a
reason
for
that.
i
mean
there
was
no
intent
to
--
to
make
a
big
case.
it
was
just
a
question
of
whether
they
were
--
had
actually
violated
the
--
mr.
sylvan
a.
garfunkel
i
think
--
if
they
don't
the
$100,
they
would
have
to
go
to
jail,
wouldn't
they?
thank
you.
