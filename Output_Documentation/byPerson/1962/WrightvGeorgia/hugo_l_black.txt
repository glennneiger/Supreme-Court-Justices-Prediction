this
is
owned
and
operated
by
the
city
of
savannah?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
that
claim
that
basketball
it
was
against
the
rule
of
the
city
to
play
basketball
in
the
park?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
claim
by
the
city
that
it
was
not
available
for
and
use
for
playing
basketball,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
finding
of
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
persons
like
these,
i'm
not
talking
about
colors
but
persons
to
play
basketball
in
the
park
was
prohibited
by
the
city
and
applied
to
everybody
in
the
same
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
fact,
no
finding
to
that
effect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
anything
in
the
charge
to
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
charge
contain
anything
based
on
such
an
assumption
that
that
was
an
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
the
charge
to
the
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
read
it.
and
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
seem
to
submit
it
on
the
fact
that
they
were
there
and
the
officer
ordered
them
to
leave
and
they
had
to
leave.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
statute
is
broad
enough
to
cover
what
was
shown
to
be
done
here,
is
it
not?
because
it
said,
assemble
for
purpose
of
disturbing
public
peace
or
for
committing
any
unlawful
act
must
moved
on
and
ordered
by
a
judge,
justice,
sheriff,
constable,
court
and
not
any
other
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
reading
it
--
i'm
reading
it
from
page
62.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
says
here
any
lawful
act
probably
has
a
strength
as
it
appears
in
the
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
page
63.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
it
has
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
happened
to
be
under
the
statute
--
under
the
statute,
they
assemble
for
the
purpose
of
disturbing
the
public
peace
or
committing
any
unlawful
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
did
he
charge
to
do
would
be
the
unlawful
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
issue
of
this
kind
submitted
to
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
evidence.
did
the
court
charge
the
jury
on
that
the
issue
which
you
were
discussing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
said
--
he
said,
“i
have
not
charged
you
fully
on
the
law”,
but
then
he
charged
on
the
law
with
reference
to
some
rule
that
they
had
that
these
people
had
violated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
practice
on
precedent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
orders
of
the
police
officer
but
is
it
the
law
as
you
understand
it
in
georgia
that
a
man's
charge
during
the
defense
of
during
accepting,
it's
unlawful
and
the
police
officer
director
orders
him
to
leave
that
when
tried
they
do
not
submit
any
issue
to
him
except
whether
he
had
to
move
when
an
officer
told
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
the
general
verdict
but
does
the
state
have
to
prove
its
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
not
of
its
case
what
you've
been
arguing
to
us
here
that
these
people
were
violating
the
rule
because
they
were
playing
at
the
time
when
children
should
play?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
mentioned
it,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
maybe
it
doesn't
affect
your
argument
saying
here
but
as
far
as
the
charge
is
concerned,
nothing
like
this
was
even
pointed
out
in
the
charge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
are
supposed
to
be
charge,
i
suppose,
but
the
law
is
what
they
had
violated
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
charge
him
what
would
be
--
on
what
they
passed
on
as
being
lawful
or
unlawful
or
except
that
you
say
they
disobeyed
the
policeman.
justice
hugo
l.
black
disturbing
the
peace
or
there
were
some
other
unlawful
acts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright,
disturbing
the
peace.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
charge
them
on
what
would
amount
to
disturbance
of
the
peace?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
charge
him
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
wouldn't
disturb
the
peace.
what
if
they
were
there
not
violating
any
rules
and
not
violating
any
rule
as
he
said
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
they
weren't
disturbed,
they
wouldn't
assemble
for
the
purpose
of
disturbing
the
peace,
wouldn't
they,
if
they
assemble
to
do
first
of
all,
a
lawful
act
on
the
park?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
they
finally
get
back
to
the
fact.
you're
saying
that
under
your
georgia
statute,
the
policeman
has
complete
power
and
one
of
their
contentions
was
i
believe,
that
has
vested
them
with
arbitrary
power.
he
has
complete
power
to
determine
whether
they've
already
done
something
for
the
purpose
of
violating
the
peace.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
have
tried,
what
would
be
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
though.
i
understand
your
citation
of
that
case
as
a
justification
of
what
was
done
for
that
and
maybe
the
way
the
jury
was
charged,
that's
what
i
think,
the
only
thing
submitted
to
them.
did
the
policeman
ordered
him
to
go
away
and
did
they
stay?
i
see
no
other
issues
submitted
except
that
and
that
case
to
which
you
refer
maybe
wholly
irrelevant
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
that
have
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
a
classification
of
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
why
should
you
include
in
your
question
then
unless
it
was
based
on
color,
the
base
that
it
was
in
a
predominantly
white
neighborhood?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
don't
get
--
it
shows
here
that
your
law
is
alright
if
you
provide
that
their
parks
are
located
in
a
predominantly
white
neighborhood,
people
can
be
excluded
on
that
kind
of
their
color?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
does
that
have
to
do
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
--
do
you
think
that
would
have
been
efficient
ground
to
exclude
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
one
that
they
were
colored
and
just
part
within
a
predominant
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that's
one
of
the
reasons
to
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
make
any
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you'd
had
a
statute
enjoined
stating
precisely
what
you've
said
here.
there
was
the
overall
consideration
for
making
it
illegal
for
these
people
to
stay
there.
in
other
words,
you
had
a
statute
which
said
that
if
georgia
wants
to
--
wants
to
regulate
the
park
and
regulates
it
this
way,
where
men
go
on
the
park,
played
and
they
are
colored,
and
they
are
there
the
time
when
they
should
not
be
there,
that's
not
what
you've
argued
here
as
to
what
had
happened,
the
--
they
shall
be
committing
an
offense.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
they
can
be
convicted
of
a
defense.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
had
embraced
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
was
the
reasons
that
this
man
gave
for
excluding
these
men
for
not
one
being
it
was
color
and
if
we
didn't
have
to
try
to
determine
which
was
the
overriding
ground
for
the
statute,
if
it
was
a
statute,
why
would
we
have
to
decide
when
it's
in
this
--
brought
up
in
this
neighborhood
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
went
in
good
and
said
he
arrest
them
because
they
were
colored.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
also
use
the
word
he
arrested
them
because
they're
colored,
weren't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
whatever
it
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
that
georgia
statute
said
partly
because
we
don't
--
do
not
want
the
people
to
play
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be
it
if
they
try
to
do
the
same
thing
with
other
statutes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
have
to
extend
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
if
this
were
to
be
used
as
a
device
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
colored
men
off,
you'd
agree
that
you
can't
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
more
than
you
could
disfranchise
people
by
the
grand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
suppose
they
only
applied
it
to
grown
men
when
they
were
colored.
he
said,
“these
were
colored
and
they
were
grown
men.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
they
need
to
introduce
and
show
the
reason
for
the
arrest
when
the
man
who
made
the
arrest
gave
the
reason?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
view
that
if
we
find
--
if
we
will
have
to
find
whether
this
was
the
overriding
purpose
and
this
is
what
you
call
the
overriding
purpose,
georgia
has
the
right
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
actual
reason
the
officer
gave
to
these
petitioners?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
your
state
permit
arrests
by
the
policeman
where
a
man
gets
peacefully
out
of
place
without
getting
him
arrested?
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
telling
him
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
might
choose
other
words.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
let's
suppose
one
of
the
first
basic
rules
to
that
arrest
here
that
you
arrest
a
man,
you
got
to
tell
him
why,
by
what
authority
you
got,
wouldn't
he
have
the
right
to
resist
it
if
he
didn't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
his
answer
didn't
encourage
them
to
think
that
he
was
anxious
to
let
them
know
why
he
was
arresting
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
in
there
that
they
didn't
act
politely?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when?
justice
hugo
l.
black
sarcastically.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
by
the
inflection
of
the
voice?
