mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
your
honors
have
heard,
the
united
states
and
the
district
court
joined
with
the
commission
in
the
defense
of
the
agency
order.
the
solicitor
general
is
persuaded,
however,
in
part
upon
the
basis
of
the
district
court's
opinion
that
the
court
correctly
concluded
that
the
commission's
order
cannot
stand
at
least
upon
its
present
foundations.
united
states
is
accordingly
an
appellant
here
only
in
a
very
limited
sense.
we
do
question
in
one
respect,
and
i
shall
come
to
that
at
the
conclusion
of
my
argument,
the
terms
of
the
district
court's
remand.
more
broadly,
however,
we
agree
with
the
court
below
that
a
remand
is
required.
this
is
so
in
our
view
not
merely
because
of
questions
which
go
to
the
adequacy
of
findings,
though
that
is
a
significant
aspect
of
the
case.
one
encounters
here,
we
think,
a
more
fundamental
issue,
namely
whether
the
commission
has
fairly
construed
and
applied
the
essential
statutory
command
which
was
written
by
congress
in
the
section
15a
(3).
before
getting
to
the
statute,
i
think
it's
necessary
to
get
a
clear
understanding
of
the
rationale
of
the
commission's
opinion
for
the
court.
now,
the
facts
of
the
case
have
already
been
stated
and
i
would
like
that
to
reemphasize
one
or
two.
all
of
the
tofc
rates
which
are
now
an
issue
before
the
court
are
concededly,
fully
compensatory
rates.
that
is
to
say
rates
which
not
only
cover
out-of-pocket
costs,
as
that
term
is
conventionally
used
but
also
overhead
cost
and
their
return.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
however,
the
district
court's
judgment
tell
the
commission
that
it
is
not
barred
from
ordering
the
cancellation
of
any
railroad
rates
which
are
below
the
fully
distributed
cost
level.
so
the
court
has
not
restricted
the
commission.
say
then,
so
far
as
the
commission
has
purported
to
order
the
cancellation
of
rates
which
would
be
at
fully
compensatory
levels.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
i
think
the
district
court
assumed
that
it
must,
that
a
regulatory
agency
in
the
field
of
rate-making
is
going
to
be
able
to
make
a
judgment
within
reasonable
limitations
as
to
costs.
that's
not
to
say
that
it's
an
easy
matter
or
that
it's
mathematically
exact
to
the
last
decimal
point.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
think
if
one
didn't
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
think
--
i
would
go
further
and
to
say
it's
almost
a
necessary
assumption
to
the
policy
of
creating
regulatory
agency.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
now,
we
have
here
then
a
case
in
which
the
commission
has
disapproved
on
the
ground
that
it
would
be
destructive
competition,
lower
rates
which
on
its
own
premise
are
fully
remunerative.
now,
the
act
in
many
of
its
provisions
and
most
notably
in
section
15a
(2),
the
paragraph
immediately
preceding
the
one
we're
talking
about
today.
the
act
in
term
seeks
efficient
railway
transportation,
this
is
a
paraphrase
of
15a
(2),
at
the
lowest
cost
consistent
with
the
furnishing
of
such
service.
now,
of
course,
the
reason
that
the
commission
has
said
in
this
case
that
the
railroads
cannot
reduce
their
rates
even
though
the
rates
as
reduced
will
be
fully
compensatory,
if
the
reason
for
that
is
its
concern
with
the
two
competing
water
carriers.
the
report
points
out
that
the
proposed
tofc
rates
would
bring
the
rail
service
down
to
the
level
of
the
existing
water
carrier
rates.
if
the
latter
water
carriers
failed
to
respond
with
the
reduction
of
their
own,
they
would,
the
commission
found
lose
business
and
as
much
as
they
suffer
certain
service
disadvantages
as
you
heard
the
less
speed,
the
greater
hazards.
if
on
the
other
hand
the
commission
report
states
the
water
carriers
reduced
their
rates
to
restore
a
price
differential,
then
the
commission
indicates
there
would
be
a
dissipation
of
carrier
revenues
for
both.
the
commission
then
goes
on
to
express
a
further
concern.
it
fears
that
the
reductions
and
the
counter-reductions
will
generate
what
it
describes
at
record
29
and
i
quote
it,
“as
a
vicious
cycle
of
rate-cutting,”
the
end
result
which
then
visualizes
is
the
destruction
of
the
water
carrier
service.
and
it
is
in
this
connection
that
the
commission
goes
on
to
say
that
it
believes
these
sea-land
and
the
seatrain
vessels
serve
an
important
roles
from
the
standpoint
of
the
national
defense.
now,
it's
obvious,
i
think
that
this
would
be
a
very
different
case,
if
the
railroads
were
here
defending
rates
which
were
below
their
out-of-pocket
costs
or
ever
below
their
fully
distributed
costs.
certainly,
it
is
true
that
the
railroads
carry
an
impressively
larger
number
of
commodities
and
that
they
serve
an
infinitely
greater
number
of
points.
it's
true
that
if
they
could
charge
unreasonably
low
rates
on
some
traffic,
making
it
up
on
other
segments
for
example,
where
there's
hard
competition,
that
they
would
be
in
a
position
by
rate-cutting
to
kill
off
the
competition.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
below
fully
distributed
cost.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
you
might
have
--
in
other
words,
we
don't
have
here
a
case
such
as
a
charge
to
national
dairy,
in
the
case
your
honors
have
just
disposed
of.
what
we
have
rather
is
an
attempt
by
the
rail
carriers
to
increase
their
volume
by
lowering
their
margin
of
profit,
the
kind
of
competition
which
is
regarded
by
this
act,
we
think,
and
by
the
law
generally
as
favored.
and
perhaps,
it's
worth
noting
incidentally
that
a
lowering
of
rates
by
regulated
carriers
does
not
necessarily
lead
to
--
in
a
shrinking
of
revenues
by
the
regulated
carriers.
apart
from
the
fact
that
lower
rates
presumably
provide
benefits
to
shippers
which
cannot
be
ignored,
one
must
also
take
into
account
that
one
of
the
consequences
of
artificially
high
transportation
charges
by
regulated
carriers
may
be
and
indeed
has
been
to
stimulate
a
shift
to
private
carriage.
a
senate
study
on
this
subject
show
that
in
1956,
21%
of
the
traffic
carried
between
cities,
figured
on
a
ten-mile
basis.
in
1946,
21%
of
it
was
in
the
hands
of
exempt
or
unregulated
carriers.
in
1959,
the
figure
had
risen
to
33%
and
that
trend
apparently
continues.
and
commissioner
freas
in
his
dissent
in
this
case
refers
to
the
tremendous
emphasis
given
to
private
carriage
by
what
he
terms,
“umbrella
rate-making.”
well,
since
it's
apparent
then
that
the
commission's
reference
to
destructive
competition
cannot
lean
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
cutting
of
rates
below
costs.
it
must
mean,
i
take
it,
one
of
two
things.
first,
the
commission
was
concerned
as
i've
already
indicated
about
the
possibility
of
the
downward
spiral
of
reductions
which
would
ultimately
pull
the
rates
below
the
level
of
full
costs.
and
certainly,
one
can
understand
this
apprehension.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
could
we
have
such
a
case?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
have
no
finding
--
definitive
finding
by
the
commission
as
to
who
has
the
lower
costs
here,
though
there
are
indications
in
the
evidence
that
the
water
carriers
may
be.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
i
would
say
that
as
long
as
the
high
cost
mode
is
getting
its
fully
distributed
cost,
there's
room
for
the
low
cost
mode
to
preserve
its
differential
and
get
fully
ruminative
return.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
it's
by
definition
or
so.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
i
think
your
honor
is
assuming
that
though
the
water
carriers
are
low
cost,
that
the
difference
is
not
enough
to
compensate
for
the
service
disadvantages.
i
would
say
that
overall
then,
the
railroads
have
the
inherent
advantages
because
the
service
factor
outweighs
the
cost
factor,
and
what
the
shipper
is
entitled
to
is
to
make
its
choice
upon
the
basis
of
cost
and
service
combined.
now,
of
course
this
is
a
great
oversimplification
because
for
some
shippers,
2%
or
3%
less
in
rates
may
be
enough
to
induce
or
maybe
half
of
percent
would
be
enough
to
induce
them
to
patronize
the
cheaper
carrier.
others
may
be
willing
to
pay
a
10%
premium
because
they're
interested
in
speed
and
so
one
has
a
spectrum,
one
of
doesn't
have
a
point
in
which
all
the
traffic
does
one
way
or
the
other
way.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
congress
has
told
the
commission
in
15a
(3),
you
are
to
let
carriers
freely
compete
each
asserting
its
inherent
advantage,
so
long
as
each
refrains
from
engaging
in
practices
which
will
impair
or
destroy
the
other
advantages,
essentially
predatory
practices.
in
terms
of
great
competition,
that
would
mean
certainly
that
any
rate
that
is
above
fully
distributed
cost
by
definition
could
not
offend.
now,
i
was
addressing
myself
to
this
concern
of
the
commission
that
reduction
might
provoke
counter-reduction
and
you
might
have
a
vicious
cycle
as
the
commission
said.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
does
not
justify
the
commission's
invoking
its
minimum
rate
powers
anticipatorily.
is
it
not
indeed
a
sufficient
answer
to
this
suggestion,
that
in
this
very
case,
the
district
court
has
sustained
the
commission.
as
to
those
proposed
tofc
rates,
rates
which
are
not
any
longer
an
issue
before
this
court,
which
would
have
been
below
the
level
of
the
fully
distributed
costs.
and
there's
second
piece
as
in
the
commission's
report
i
think
and
this
lies
at
the
heart
of
it.
it
is
that
the
water
carrier
should
be
given
the
benefit
of
a
rate
differential,
so
that
they
will
get
an
assured
share
of
the
traffic.
the
commission
has
found,
it's
been
pointed
out
that
the
water
carriers
have
certain
service
disadvantages.
the
commission
then
undertakes
to
remedy
this
by
ordering
the
rail
carriers
to
keep
their
tofc
rates
no
less
than
6%
above
the
level
of
the
water
carriers
existing
rates.
now,
i
would
stress
that
the
commission
has
not
held
either
(a),
that
the
water
carriers
have
a
cost
advantage
on
the
traffic
in
question
or
(b)
that
the
rail
reductions
would
prevent
the
water
carriers
from
asserting
or
realizing
the
benefit
of
any
such
cost
advantages
they
might
have.
as
to
(a),
the
commission
found
and
i
quote
it,
“we
cannot
determine
on
these
records
where
the
inherent
advantages
may
lie
as
to
any
of
the
rates
in
issue".
as
to
(b),
it
seems
to
me
difficult
to
see
how
the
reduced
rail
rates
here
in
question
could
improperly
impair
the
assertion
of
any
cost
advantage
which
the
water
carriers
might
have
on
this
traffic,
or
is
that
already
indicated
if
the
rails
or
the
high
cost
mode
and
if
the
rails
are
realizing
more
than
their
fully
distributed
cost
on
this
traffic,
then
the
water
carriers
obviously
can
reduce
their
rates
and
still
receive
a
fully
remunerative
return.
i
think
then
one
is
necessarily
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
the
commission
is
seeking
to
achieve
here
what
it
regards
as
a
fair
division
of
the
traffic
and
the
maintenance
of
a
stable
relationship
between
these
competing
carriers.
indeed,
if
there's
any
doubt
at
all
about,
about
this,
i
would
say
that
it
was
completely
disvalued
by
what
the
commission
says
about
boxcar,
the
rail
boxcar
rates
as
distinguished
from
tofc
rates.
now,
this
part
of
the
commission's
opinion
is
advisory.
you
don't
have
any
boxcar
rates
before
you
in
this
case.
but
the
commission's
report
undertakes
to
tell
the
railroads
what
will
be
favorably
considered
in
the
future
for
boxcar
service
which
also
competes
with
this
water
carrier
service.
the
commission
notes
and
this
is
in
the
record
at
36
that
boxcar
transportation
can
be
provided
in
many
instances
more
cheaply
than
the
water
carrier
transportation.
nonetheless,
the
commission
says,
the
rail
boxcar
service
must
also
be
pegged
above
the
water
carrier
rates.
the
reason
given
is
that
the
boxcar
service,
like
the
tofc
service,
though
in
lesser
degree
is
more
attractive
to
shippers
than
the
water
carrier
service.
thus,
the
commission
concludes
as
to
boxcar
rates
that
the
more
attractive
and
the
cheaper
service
must
be
performed
at
a
higher
rate.
and
this,
it
would
seem
to
me,
is
in
terms
to
deny
to
a
carrier
the
opportunity
to
assert
its
inherent
advantages
of
cost
and
of
service.
it
appears
to
be
doing
with
senator
smathers
of
the
commerce
committee
referred
to
when
the
bill
that
became
15a
(3)
was
before
the
congress,
the
commission
seems
to
be
acting
as
a
giant
handicapper,
fixing
rate
relationships
in
his
terms
so
that
each
will
share
in
the
person
nobody
would
drop
out
of
the
rates.
it
was
that
that
the
commerce
committee
said,
the
commission
was
not
to
do.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
don't
think
that
they
undid
with
the
one
hand
what
they
did
with
the
other.
and
i
should
like
at
this
point
therefore
to
come
to
the
legislative
history.
now,
in
the
form
originally
proposed,
it's
true
that
the
bill
would
have
absolutely
forbidden
the
commission
without
any
qualification
in
determining
whether
a
rate
was
below
a
reasonable
minimum,
would
have
forbidden
the
commission
even
to
consider
the
effect
of
that
rate
upon
other
modes
of
transportation.
the
history
reveals
that
this
proposal
was
ultimately
modified
to
meet
the
objection
of
the
commission
among
others.
an
objection
voiced
by
its
then
chairman,
commissioner
freas.
that
the
absolute
prohibition
might
disable
the
commission
from
dealing
with
rates
which
were
predatory
or
destructive
in
the
sense
that
they
would
undermine
the
inherent
advantages
of
competing
modes,
rather
than
assert
legitimately
the
advantages
of
the
rate
proponent.
and
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief,
commissioner
freas'
statement
and
i'll
just
quote
one
sentence
of
it
here
because
i
think
this
is
the
essence
of
the
point
that
he
stated
repeatedly
to
the
committee.
if
he
said,
“we
are
required
to
accept
the
rates
of
the
high
cost
carrier
merely
because
they
exceed
its
out-of-pocket
costs,
we
see
no
way
of
preserving
the
inherent
advantages
of
the
low
cost
carrier.”
in
any
event,
that
other
mode
would
be
compelled
to
depress
its
rates
below
full
costs
in
order
to
preserve
its
inherent
advantages
against
the
high
cost
mode
of
transportation.
i
was
weary
of
the
history,
congress
in
recognition
of
the
fourth
of
this
point
changed
the
language
ultimately
to
its
present
form.
both
the
senate
and
house
committee
reports
on
the
final
bill,
tell
us
and
i'm
quoting
here
the
senate
report
that
the
new
provision
was
designed
to
encourage
competition
by
allowing
each
form
of
transportation
full
opportunity
to
make
rates
reflecting
the
inherent
advantages
each
has
to
offer.
and
then
the
report
goes
on,
such
rate-making
would
be
regulated
by
the
i.c.c.
to
prevent
unfair
or
destructive
competitive
practices
as
contemplated
by
the
declaration
of
national
transportation
policy.
now,
there's
something
further
that's
informative
in
the
committee
reports.
both
the
congressional
committees
expressed
their
complete
approval
of
two
decisions,
one
this
court's
decision
in
the
shaffer
transportation
case,
the
other
in
i.c.c.
decision
of
1945
in
a
case
known
as
new
automobiles.
the
specific
language
of
the
shaffer
to
which
the
committee
reports
referred
is
the
language
which
states,
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
court's
opinion,
“the
ability
of
one
mode
of
transportation
to
operate
with
a
rate
lower
than
the
competing
types
of
transportation
is
precisely
the
sort
of
inherent
advantage
that
the
congressional
policy
requires
the
commission
to
recognize.”
new
automobiles
was
the
case
in
which
the
i.c.c.
or
at
least
though
the
committees
of
congress
thought
had
refused
to
hold
up
the
rates
of
one
type
of
carrier
to
protect
another
mode.
the
committee
reports,
expressed
their
concern
that
the
commission
instead
of
adhering
to
that
approach
had
backed
away.
i
think
it's
also
suggestive
that
commissioner
freas,
who
may
well
have
been
the
most
influential
man
in
shaping
this
statutory
provision
to
its
ultimate
form
has
dissented
in
the
instant
case
on
the
expressed
ground
that
the
commission
has
completely
departed
from
the
congressional
directive.
his
dissent
concludes
and
i
think
properly
that
the
decision
of
the
majority
may
well
be
taken
to
stand
for
the
proposition
that
water
carriers
are
ordinarily
entitled
to
rate
differentials
regardless
of
the
circumstances
of
the
specific
case.
i
do
not
read
the
statute
to
require
as
matter
of
law
or
even
to
permit
blanket
protection
from
reasonable
competition
for
the
water
carriers,
or
for
that
matter
for
any
mode
of
transportation.
i
might
add
that
judge
hincks
extended
the
examination
of
the
legislative
history
in
the
district
court,
led
him
to
the
same
conclusion.
i'm
not
suggesting
for
a
moment
that
if
the
commission
were
to
find
that
the
water
carriers
have
a
6%
cost
advantage,
that
the
commission
could
not
take
steps
to
protect
that
6%
cost
advantage
at
least
when
the
point
was
reached
when
the
railroads
were
lowering
their
rate
so
far
that
the
water
carriers
could
no
longer
maintain
that
6%
differential
and
obtain
fully
ruminative
rates.
we
don't
have
that
premise
to
operate
on
in
this
case.
now
in
these
few
remaining
minutes
that
i
have,
i
could
best
justify
my
--
our
stated
as
an
appellant
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
commission
has
not
made
a
finding
as
to
who
has
the
cost
advantage
or
if
so,
how
much
it
is
in
percentage
terms.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
would
make
a
difference
only
if
the
commission
were
to
find
further
that
the
relationship
had
to
be
maintained
and
the
rates
had
to
be
well
above
fully
distributed
cost,
so
that
these
carriers
could
subsidize
other
traffic
on
which
they
could
not
realize
their
costs.
but
the
commission
has
stated
above
in
--
well
stated
in
its
brief
and
the
commission's
report
bears
this
out,
this
isn't
the
basis
of
the
decision
either.
i
wanted
to
get
for
a
few
minutes
to
the
point
on
which
we
are
here
as
an
appellant,
which
it
relates
to
the
terms
of
the
district
court's
remands
so
far
as
the
factor
of
the
national
defense
is
concerned.
we
think
that
the
district
court
goes
too
far
when
it
states
that
the
national
defense
consideration
is
merely
a
hope
for
objective
though
truly
it
is
at
least
that.
and
that
it
cannot
in
any
circumstances
be
an
operative
policy
from
which
a
commission
order
can
draw
a
substance.
we
believed
that
if
there
were
a
showing,
for
example,
that
the
particular
types
of
vessels
operated
by
seatrain
had
special
characteristic,
that
these
were
relied
upon
by
the
defense
establishment
to
perform
a
unique
role
in
the
case
of
the
national
emergency
or
a
war,
that
this
would
be
the
kind
of
factor
upon
which
the
commission
could
take
into
account
in
undertaking
to
keep
seatrain
operating
as
a
viable
carrier.
now,
we
don't
think
here
that
commission
has
any
basis
for
saying
that
seatrain
is
threatened
with
destruction
because
on
its
own
findings
as
to
costs,
that
conclusion
does
not
follow.
but
if
the
destruction
of
the
water
carrier
were
threatened
and
if
there
were
a
specific
showing
that
the
water
carrier
filled
a
vital
need
which
could
not
be
otherwise
filled,
then
we
think
the
commission
could
take
this
into
account.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
and
on
the
second
factor,
we
would
think
that
the
commission
would
require
something
more
than
a
generalized
statement
in
a
rather
outdated
maritime
administration
report
or
senate
report
that
domestic
tonnage
is
desirable.
we
would
think
that
there
ought
to
be
a
specific
showing
that
these
vessels
were
needed
and
vitally
needed
for
purpose
that
could
not
be
otherwise
satisfied.
there's
no
evidence
at
all
for
example,
in
this
record
from
the
department
of
defense
or
from
the
office
of
emergency
transportation,
the
people
who
have
the
responsibility
for
wartime
transportation
needs.
we
suggest,
however,
that
the
commission
should
not
be
confined
on
remand,
that
it
should
not
be
foreclosed
from
taking
and
considering
additional
evidence
as
to
the
needs
of
national
defense.
if
it
should
appear
from
still
other
evidence
that
the
continued
operation
of
the
water
carriers
involved
is
in
fact
in
danger.
