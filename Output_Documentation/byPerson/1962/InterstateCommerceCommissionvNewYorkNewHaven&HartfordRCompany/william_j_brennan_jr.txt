justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
mr.
helmetag
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
whether
for
--
whether
hope
for
or
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
isn't
it
an
objective?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
appreciate
your
argument
but
i
know
your
position
as
you've
restated
it
very
well
indeed.
but
what
occurs
to
me
is
this.
i
expect
what's
bothering
me
is
the
same
thing
that
my
brother
stewart
has
addressed
it
was
bothering
him.
after
all
we're
dealing
with
15a
(3)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
whatever
may
have
been
these
objectives
if
you'll
join
me
for
a
moment
in
using
that
description
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
preservation
of
the
national
defense,
preserving
to
the
extent
we
possibly
can,
the
help
of
all
four
modes
of
transportation,
if
they
are
objectives,
whatever
may
have
been
whether
hope
or
otherwise
in
as
expressed
in
the
national
transportation
policy
itself,
isn't
there
a
expressed
direction
here
to
the
commission,
that
for
this
purpose
that
in
any
event,
the
prohibition
is
modified
to
the
extent
necessary
giving
due
consideration
to
those
objectives?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
you
mean
at
least
that
much?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
may
be
true
that
those
are
--
that
in
other
words,
those
are
standards
which
adhered
to,
should
bring
about
the
hope
for
result.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
my
question
is
whether
in
15a
(3)
objectives
--
we're
trying
to
these
same
ones,
this
“hope
for
results”
don't
have
a
different
connotation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
really
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
answer
to
me
really
is
to
all
that
giving
consideration
to
the
objectives
is
that,
yes
that
if
you
can
accomplish
them
by
adhering
to
the
standard
which
preceded
the
objectives
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
for
15a
(3)
those
are
necessarily
interwoven
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
15a
(3)
anyway
makes
it
the
part
of
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
fact
that
it's
a
preamble
is
unimportant,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
there's
no
particular
significance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
that
instead
of
giving
due
consideration
to
the
language
there
except
to
the
extent
necessary
to
achieve
the
objectives
of
the
national
transportation
act,
we
wouldn't
have
so
much
trouble
with
it,
the
15a
(3),
would
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
just
ask
this?
