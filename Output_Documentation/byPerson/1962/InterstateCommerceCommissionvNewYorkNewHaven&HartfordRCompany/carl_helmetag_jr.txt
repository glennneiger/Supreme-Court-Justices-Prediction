mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
the
court
pleases,
i
shall
present
the
only
argument
on
behalf
of
the
appellee
railroads.
and
since
the
government
has
set
forth
some
of
the
positions
that
we
wouldn't
normally
set
forth
in
this
case,
i
believe
i
can
shorten
my
argument
somewhat
and
perhaps
save
some
of
the
court's
time.
now,
the
pricing
controversy
that's
before
this
court
had
been
in
continued
existent
for
five
years.
it
began
in
1957
and
long
as
that
may
seem
i
would
say
that
the
background
for
this
controversy
goes
back
as
far
as
the
post-war,
post
world
war
ii
readjustment
period.
in
the
span
of
15
years
from
1948
to
the
present
time,
there
has
been
dramatic
and
drastic
changes
in
the
transportation
industry
which
has
changed
the
whole
economic
role
of
this
industry.
and
mr.
ginnane
and
mr.
spritzer
referred
to
the
presidential
advisory
committee's
report
on,
on
transport
policy,
a
study
which
is
made
by
the
so-called,
weeks
committee,
headed
by
then
secretary
of
commerce
weeks.
now,
that
committee
made
a
very
extensive
study
of
the
transportation
industry
and
they
found
that
as
late
as
1920,
the
transportation
industry
was
a
monopoly
industry
in
which
the
railroad
had
a
virtual
monopoly
of
all
the
surface
transportation
with
the
exception
of
a
small
part
which
was
along
the
inland
waterways.
however,
the
situation
is
completely
changed
and
the
weeks
committee
pointed
out
that
the
industry
now
has
one
of
pervasive
competition.
the
weeks
committee
went
on
to
say
that
a
shipper,
shipping
freight
between
various
points
has
available
not
only
his
own
fleet
of
trucks
but
he
has
available
a
complete
and
widespread
system
of
motor
common
carrier
and
motor
contract
carrier.
in
addition,
he
has
a
continental-wide
integrated
rail
system,
pipeline
and
he
has
a
rapidly
growing
and
expanding
water
carrier
industry
on
the
inland
waterway,
and
not
to
mention
a
growing
air
transport
industry.
now,
the
weeks
committee
pointed
out
that
while
these
changes
had
taken
place
in
the
transportation
industry,
that
government
regulation
had
not
kept
pace
with
them
and
strangely
enough
was
still
reflecting
monopolistic
concept.
and
as
matter
of
fact
regulation
was
being
expanded
in
a
period
when
competition
in
the
industry
was
growing.
and
to
remedy
this
situation,
the
weeks
committee
pointed
that
there
is
a
need
for
a
complete
overhaul
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
particularly
in
the
field
of
inter-mode
competitive
rate-making.
and
they
recommended
legislation
would
permit
a
greater
play
of
the
forces
of
competition.
now
after
the
weeks
committee
report
came
out
in
1955,
study
committee
then
both
the
senate
and
the
house
were
formed.
study
committees
of
the
senate
and
house
committees
on
interstate
and
foreign
commerce,
and
those
study
committees,
principally
in
the
senate,
held
extensive
hearings
at
which
all
people
interested
in
the
transportation
industry
testified.
and
some
very
significant
facts,
facts
which
bear
on
the
price
and
controversy
here
were
developed
in
those
hearings.
briefly,
it
was
brought
out
that
the
transportation
market
as
a
whole
was
a
growing
one.
but
that
the
railroads'
share
of
the
market
was
rapidly
declining.
and
by
contrast
the
competitors
run
an
entirely
different
situation,
that
their
competitors
--
that
is
the
motor
carriers,
the
water
carriers
and
other
freight
carriers
--
were
not
only
realizing
the
growth
of
the
transportation
market,
but
were
growing
faster
than
the
market
by
diverting
traffic
from
the
railroad.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
these
hearings,
sir,
began
right
after
the
weeks
committee
report
came
out
in
1955
and
continued
through
1958.
and
actually,
the
report
of
these
subcommittee
studies
is
found
in
the
report
of
the
senate
subcommittee
which
highlighted
this
problem.
the
subcommittee's
report
was
entitled,
“the
problems
of
the
railroads.”
and
after
noting
the
decline
of
the
railroad
industry
in
the
corresponding
growth
of
the
rail
competitors,
the
subcommittee
noted
that
the
working
capital
of
the
railroad
was
in
a
dangerously
low
position,
and
that
the
railroad
--
that
this
decline
in
the
railroad
was
not
occasioned
by
the
recession
that
was
then
going
on
in
the
economy.
actually
the
sickness
of
the
railroad
industry
were
deepening
the
recession
--
and
eroding
the
nation's
economy.
now,
the
subcommittee,
the
senate
subcommittee
recommended
legislation
to
permit
greater
freedom
of
competitive
forces
in
inter-mode
pricing.
now,
the
reason
for
this
was
that
the
subcommittee
found
that
the
decline
of
the
railroad
was
largely
caused
by
overregulation.
now,
this
over
regulation
was
particularly
severe
in
the
inter-mode
competitive
pricing
field.
the
commission
in
the
new
automobiles
case,
a
case
which
has
then
referred
to
by
mr.
spritzer,
a
case
which
was
decided
1945
had
stated
that
it
would
not
hold
up
the
rates
of
one
mode
by
artificial
pricing
restraints
or
differentials
to
protect
the
traffic
of
another
mode.
however,
while
the
commission
had
announced
this
policy
it
was
frequently
deviating
from
it
and
adopting
a
diametrically
opposite
policy.
what
the
commission
was
doing
was
using
its
minimum
rate
powers
to
prescribe
pricing
relationships
or
pricing
differentials
for
the
purpose
of
dividing
the
traffic
among
the
various
modes.
according
to
its
notions
of
what
it
thought
were
fair
shares
for
each.
now,
there
were
two
effects
from
this
paternalistic
policy
of
the
commission.
the
first
was
it
was
depriving
the
public
of
the
lower
charges
that
the
increased
competition
ought
to
bring
about.
and
secondly
and
perhaps
more
importantly,
it
were
depriving
the
railroad
of
the
opportunity
to
effectively
compete.
now
when
the
two
committees
of
the
senate
and
house,
the
committee
on
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
committee
studied
the
report
of
the
senate
subcommittee,
they
too
were
convinced
that
there
was
need
for
a
legislation
to
relax
the
commission's
policy
with
respect
to
inter-mode
competitive
pricing.
and
to
accomplish
this,
the
committees
recommended
the
statutory
language
which
it
presently
found
in
section
15a
(3)
and
that
the
recommendations
of
the
committee
were
accepted.
and
that
language
which
was
read
to
you
by
mr.
ginnane,
it
would
became
part
of
the
transportation
act
in
1958
and
it
is
the
law
governing
this
case.
if
i
might
briefly
summarize
the
background
of
this
legislation,
it
was
a
product
of
a
very
serious
concern
when
a
part
of
a
congress
with
the
drastic
decline
of
the
taking
place
in
the
railroad
industry,
which
the
congress
felt
was
undermining
the
--
the
nation's
of
the
economy.
by
the
same
--
at
the
same
time,
the
railroad
competitors
were
flourishing
and
receiving
a
larger
and
larger
share
of
the
market.
the
congress
was
convinced
that
the
decline
of
the
railroad
was
largely
occasioned
by
the
action
on
the
part
of
the
commission
of
using
artificial
pricing
differentials,
pegging
rate
to
protect
the
traffic
of
one
mode
from
the
pricing
reduction
of
another,
and
to
terminate
this
policy
on
the
part
of
the
commission,
the
congress
enacted
the
section
15a
(3).
so
it's
against
this
background
of
a
rapidly
declining
railroad
industry,
which
was
causing
great
concern
to
the
congress
that
this
pricing
adjustment
ought
to
be
viewed.
now,
if
i
might,
i
would
like
just
momentarily
to
briefly
comment
on
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
adjustment
itself
that
we're
talking
about.
the
legislation
involved
which
ultimately
became
section
15a
(3)
was
before
the
congress
in
1957
and
it
was
that
time
when
the
railroad
were
in
their
most
depressed
condition.
and
i
might
say
that
while
the
depression
of
the
1957
and
1958
is
over
for
industry
generally,
the
railroad
and
particularly
those
in
the
east
are
still
seriously
depressed.
when
these
conditions
were
just
about
at
their
worst
for
the
railroad,
sea-land
one
of
the
appellants
here
announced
in
the
press
and
in
the
journal
that
it
was
reentering
the
coastwise
trade
with
a
brand
new
containership
service.
and
as
it
been
explained,
this
containership
service
moved
highway
containers
on
ships
between
the
port
and
provide
what
is
in
effect
the
counterpart
of
a
motor
carrier
service.
so
far
as
the
shipper
is
concerned
or
the
consignee
is
concerned,
it's
a
motor
carrier
service.
the
freight
is
picked
up
at
the
shipper's
door
in
a
motor
vehicle.
it's
moved
in
the
motor
vehicle
to
the
port
with
the
lading
intact,
no
handling
of
the
lading,
the
container
is
lifted
off
the
chassis,
placed
on
a
ship
and
moved
to
a
port
in
the
south
or
the
southwest.
there,
it's
unloaded
with
again
with
lading
intact,
placed
on
a
highway
trailer,
moved
over
the
highway
from
just
the
same
manner
that
the
motor
carrier
would
through
to
the
consignee
place
of
business.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
precisely
the
same,
sir
with
one
minor
change
with
respect
to
sea-land,
the
container
is
moved
on
a
ship
from
port
to
port
whereas
with
trailer
on
flatcar
or
piggyback
service,
the
trailer
is
moved
over
the
--
on
a
railroad
flatcar
between
the
two
major
cities
and
fanned
out
to
the
consignee
in
a
motor-type
operation.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
whatever,
whatever
takes
place
by
reading
the
fact
it
was
one
service
involved
a
movement
of
the
trailer
on
a
ship
and
the
other
moves
on
a
--
at
a
rail
flatcar.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
but
the
same
--
but
they're
the
same
from
the
shipper's
standpoint,
they
provide
what
is
virtually
the
same
quality
of
service.
now,
i
might
say
that
the
railroad
at
this
time
and
prior
thereto
had
lost
the
great
deal
of
traffic
to
the
motor
carrier
primarily
because
the
motor
carrier
service
was
genuinely
superior
to
the
rail
boxcar
service.
and
that
when
sea-land
came
in
and
said
it
was
going
to
provide
what
in
effect
was
a
motor
carrier
service
is,
the
railroads
were
greatly
concerned
about
this.
it
was
a
new
competitive
of
the
same
nature
as
their
arts
competitors
were
providing,
namely
the
motor
carrier.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes,
sir
because
let
me
say
this
sir,
the
commission
has
never
in
its
history
of
regulation
since
1935
with
respect
to
the
motor
carrier
taken
any
position
like
it
takes
here,
that
it
is
entitled
to
--
to
hold
up
motor
carrier
rates
to
protect
the
railroad.
it's
never
taken
that
position
in
any
instance.
so
that
the
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
necessary
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
thrust
of
this
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
we're
against
it,
sir.
we
--
and
we
feel
likely
so
we
--
we
--
we
found
that
under
the
paternalistic
policy
to
the
commission
of
using
artificial
pricing
restraint,
restraint
to
keep
the
prices
pegged,
that
we
could
not
effectively
compete.
whether
the
commission
is
of
the
opinion
that
this
--
these
artificially
high
rates
are
beneficial
to
the
carrier
is
really
immaterial,
it's
the
customer
that
determined
which
mode
of
transport
will
be
used.
and
we
found
--
and
as
the
committees
of
congress
found
that
we
were
steadily
losing
ground
under
these
paternalistic
policy
and
we
don't
want
them.
and
the
congress
said
that
it
doesn't
want
them.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
ordered
the
commission
to
abandon
them.
it
once
--
in
this
field,
the
free
forces
of
competition
to
give
the
customer
the
lowest
price
that's
reasonable
under
the
circumstances,
and
to
permit
the
carrier
to
compete
as
business
generally
does
in
the
marketplace
for
the
customers'
favor.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
what
we
think
will
preserve
the
railroad
above
everything
else
is
to
allow
us
to
compete
in
the
marketplace,
to
reduce
our
rates,
if
necessary,
to
attract
traffic
and
increase
our
volume.
provided
the
rates
exceed
our
costs
and
give
us
a
reasonable
profit,
then
we
feel
that
under
that
kind
of
competitive
climate,
that
we
can
successfully
compete
and
that
we
will
be
able
to
have
a
national
transportation
system
adequate
for
the
commerce
in
defense
of
this
nation.
and
we
might
say
that
that's
exactly
what
we
thought
--
what
we
think
congress
intended
by
the
enactment
of
this
statute.
i'm
sorry,
sir
--
i
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
well,
sir
the
--
we
think
the
national
transportation
policy
sets
forth
several
mandates.
if
you
read
--
if
the
format
of
the
policy
itself
sets
forth,
not
enumerated,
but
specified
mandate.
the
most
--
probably,
the
most
important
one
and
the
leading
one
in
the
transportation
policy
itself
is
the
protection
of
the
inherent
advantages
of
the
carrier.
now
this
court
had
indicated
that
the
inherent
advantages,
the
inherent
advantage
of
low
cost
is
set
out
in
the
shaffer
case.
and
the
reference
to
the
national
transportation
policy
in
15a
(3)
was
incorporated
for
the
purpose
of
advising
the
commission
that
they
should
consider
that
mandate
and
in
particular,
and
the
other
mandate
of
the
policy
too.
now,
for
example
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
no,
sir.
there
is
none.
they're
exactly
the
opposite
sir,
but
the,
the
mandates
of
the
policy
if
i
might
say
so
indicate
that
the
regulation
should
be
carried
out,
to
bring
about
sound
economics
in
--
in
--
in
--
in
transportation
to
preserve
inherent
advantages
to
--
for
the
customers
and
patron,
the
lowest
possible
charges
without
undue
preferences,
discrimination,
and
that
type
of
thing.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
there's
none
of
--
there's
none
in
the
specified
mandate
as
such.
but
when
you
get
to
the
end
of
the
policy
it
says,
that
if
all
these
things
are
done
and
all
these
guidelines
are
followed,
the
end
product
will
be
a
national
transportation
system
adequate
for
the
commerce
and
the
defense
of
this
nation.
and
that's
what
the
lower
court
said.
they
said
that
the
reference
to
the
preservation
of
the
national
defense
and
the
commerce
of
the
nation
was
the
hope
for
end
of
the
policy.
and
that
the
mandate
in
the
policy
preceded,
if
you
will,
or
came
ahead
of
that,
that
hope
for
objective,
sir.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
well
sir,
it's
the
congress'
statement
that
if
the
act
taken
as
a
whole,
the
whole
scheme
of
regulation
is
carried
out
by
the
commission
in
conformity
with
the
specific
provisions
of
the
statute,
and
then
keeping
in
mind
and
recognizing
the
specified
mandates
in
the
policy.
then,
if
that
is
done
and
under
fair
and
impartial
regulation,
the
result
then
will
be
a
national
transportation
system
adequate
for
the
defense
that
goes
on
to
set
the
commerce
of
postal
department,
and
in
effect,
you'd
have
an
efficient
economic
national
transportation
system.
but
that
is
and
what
we
say,
congress
meant
when
it
referred
to
the
national
transportation
policy
in
section
15a
(3),
it
modified
to
some
extent
the
prohibition
against
protective
pricing
differentials.
i
thought
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
well
sir,
it
modified
it
that
by
saying
that
that
the
regulation
should
be
carried
out.
and
in
accordance
with
the
national
transportation
policy,
and
then
in
all
fairness,
the
legislative
history
of
this
section,
allow
--
it's
rather
extended
over
a
period
of
time.
the
reports
are
quite
small
and
they
did
not
spell
out
in
detail
each
type
of
thing
that
the
commission
could
or
could
not
do
by
reason
of
the
incorporation
of
the
national
transportation
policy
but
if
you
read
them,
read
the
legislative
history
in
the
light
of
the
background
and
particularly
in
the
light
of
what
the
committee
said
with
respect
to
its
desire
to
end
the
paternalistic
pricing
policy
to
the
commission,
it's
pretty
clear
that
the
report
of
the
commission
in
this
instance
is
without
any
legal
basis
to
sustain
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
would
appear
to
us,
and
i
think
as
it
appeared
to
the
lower
court,
and
it's
appeared
to
the
government
here
that
the
very
basis
is
used
by
the
commission,
and
the
only
basis
for
its
report
is
the
precise
basis
denied
to
it
by
section
15a
(3).
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
it
tells
the
commission
that
it
shall
not
--
you
have
to
read
it
in
connection
sir
with
the
prohibition.
the
prohibition
is
that
the
commission
shall
not
hold
up
the
rate
of
one
mode
of
transportation
to
protect
the
traffic
of
another.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes.
then
it
said
giving
due
consideration
to
the
objectives
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
i
believe
it
says,
stated
in
this
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
i
may
not
be
reading
it
quite
right.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
but
in
any
event
the
--
in
the
loop
to
the
national
transportation
policy
to
find
out
what
the
commission
is
to
do
and
you'll
find
by
the
very
format
of
the
policy
itself
that
it
specified
several
things
the
commission
shall
do.
and
then,
then
it
ends
with
a
dash,
a
colon,
and
a
dash,
and
it
goes
on
and
say
that
if
all
these
guidelines
are
followed,
end
results
of
this
would
be
a
national
transportation
system,
adequate
for
the
defense
and
the
commerce
of
the
nation.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
now
sir,
if
i
might
address
to
my
argument
and
to
answer
your
question
because
i
think
it
leads
me
into
the
point
i
want
to
make.
basically,
the
commission
says
this,
at
first
it
distained
in
this
case
from
deciding
off
on
the
basis
of
the
inherent
cost
advantage.
now,
very
practically
there
was
a
good
reason
why
the
commission
didn't
do
that.
in
this
case
in
addition
to
the
66
tofc
rates
we
have
involved,
there
was
some
600
of
the
sea-land
rate
involvement.
now,
with
respect
to
those
comparing
the
cost
of
providing
the
service
on
those
600
sea-land
rate,
with
the
cost
of
the
railroad
and
boxcar
service,
the
commission
cost
section
found
that
the
railroad
with
a
low
cost
carrier,
in
a
great
many
instances,
actually,
the
record
before
the
commission
indicated
that
they
were
low
cost
carrier
in
most
every
instance.
now,
if
they
had
based
this
decision
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes,
the
railroads
were.
if
they
had
based
this
decision
upon
an
inherent
cost
advantage,
the
effect
would've
been
that
the
railroads
would've
been
entitled
to
the
differential.
and
of
course,
that
would've
worsened
the
situation
so
far
as
sea-land
was
concerned.
so
the
commission
distained
and
put
aside
any,
any
use
of
the
inherent
low
cost
advantage
and
looked
to
another
section
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
and
they
said
this
sir,
they
said
the
question
is
whether
or
not
these
rate
reductions
constitute
unfair
or
destructive
competitive
practices,
and
then
they
found
that
they
did.
and
they
found
that
they
did
for
this
reason,
if
these
rates
become
effective
they
will
attract
traffic
from
sea-land
and
seatrain
and
make
it
impossible
or
difficult
for
them
to
continue
in
business.
in
other
words,
they
say
that
a
pricing
adjustment
which
will
result
in
attracting
traffic
to
a
carrier
is
an
unlawful
one
if
it
will
attract
enough
traffic
to
harm
a
competitor,
if
the
diversion
is
inconsequential,
if
it
doesn't
amount
to
anything,
then
the
commission
may
not
follow
the
prohibition
in
section
15a
(3).
now,
the
commission
went
a
little
further
than
that
and
attempted
to
bolster
to
that
basic
proposition
which
was
apparently
completely
inconsistent
with
the
statute
because
the
statute
said,
they
shouldn't
hold
up
the
rates.
and
then
the
commission
says
we
can
when
we
think
it's
to
the
benefit
of
preserving
a
carrier,
to
bolster
that
proposition,
they
referred
to
the
national
--
preservation
of
the
national
defense.
and
they
in
some
very
broad
language
said
that
the
inter-coastal
water
carriers
were
important
to
the
national
defense
and
that
they
needed
differential
then
they're
favored
to
survive,
and
therefore,
the
commission
in
order
to
preserve
them,
would
prescribe
the
differential.
now,
where
the
commission
got
the
figure
6%
is
nowhere
in
the
record.
nowhere
explained
in
their
report,
probably
was
an
informed
guess
but
the
source
of
it
is
a
complete
mystery.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
i'm
saying
sir,
first,
i'm
saying
number
--
i'd
like
to
say
first
what
the
court
below
did
because
we're
adopting
that
position
here.
the
court
below
said
that
the
national
defense
reliance
upon
the
national
defense
by
the
commission
was
improper
for
two
basis
or
for
two
reasons
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes,
improper
sir,
for
two
reasons.
first,
that
there
were
no
findings
in
the
commission's
report
to
show
in
what
way
the
national
defense
would
be
jeopardized
if
the
sea-land
and
seatrain
were
not
preserved.
there
were
no
findings
on
that
at
all.
all
the
commission
did
was
refer
to
these
two
fairly
old
reports
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
spritzer,
which
indicated
that
there
is
some
value
to
the
national
defense
of
coastwise
water
carrier.
but
then
the
court
went
further
and
said
that
regardless
of
the
adequacy
of
the
findings,
the
commission
is
without
power
to
do
what
it
did
in
this
case
by
referring
to
the
provision
in
the
national
transportation
policy
with
respect
to
the
preservation
of
the
national
defense.
the
court
said
that
the
preservation
of
the
national
defense
as
i
indicated
in
answering
some
other
question
was
the
hope
for
objective
of
the
national
transportation
policy
and
was
not
a
mandate
to
the
commission.
in
other
words,
the
commission
upon
finding
that
a
particular
carrier
is
desirable
to
the
national
defense
or
valuable
to
it,
it
cannot
deviate
from
the
requirements
of
the
act
or
the
requirements
of
the
national
transportation
policy
itself,
in
order
to
preserve
that
carrier
for
the
national
defense
purpose.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
as
the
court
below
sir,
characterized
it
as
the
hope
for
an
end
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
it's
the,
it's
the
hope
--
it's
the
--
it's
the
objective
sir
in
the
sense
that
if
the
entire
act
in
the
scheme
of
regulation
is
carried
out
in
conformity
with
that
matter.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
right.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
right.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes,
sir
and
i
think
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
i
would
think
sir
the
--
the
way
to
read
it
in
the
context
or
the
format
of
the
section
itself
is
that,
if
i
say,
that
if
you
follow
the
specified
mandates,
now
you'll
note
that
the
specified
mandate
in
the
policy
sir,
if
you
have
of
the
national
transportation
policy
at
page
57
of
the
commission's
brief,
you'll
note
that
it
sets
the
mandates
out
by
cause,
they're
separated
by
semi-colon,
to
tell
the
commission
do
each
one
of
these
very
specific
type
things,
although
they're
cast
in
somewhat
general
terms.
and
then
it
goes
on
and
ends
that
phase
of
the
policy
and
then
says
that
if
again
--
again,
if
all
of
these
guidelines
are
followed,
the
result
will
be
if
you
please
sir
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
right.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
well
sir,
the
court
below
was
of
the
opinion
that
they
do
not
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
they
were
of
opinion
that
the
hope
for
objective
were
not
a
mandate
of
the
policy
and
that
our
position,
i
would
point
out
that
if
the
transportation
regulation
is
carried
on
by
the
commission
subject
to
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
subject
to
the
specified
mandate
in
the
policy
does
not
accomplish
that
objective.
that
is
of
providing
the
nation
with
an
adequate
transportation
system,
then
the
remedy
which
congress
has
followed
is
to
amend
the
statute
and
that's
exactly
what
it
did
in
this
instance.
it
amended
the
statute
to
provide
for
a
freer
working
of
force
of
the
competition
and
in
doing
so
it
specifically
stated
that
the
purpose
and
objective
of
providing
this
freer
play
of
competitive
forces
was
to
strengthen
and
improve
the
national
transportation
system
though
that
it
would
be
adequate
for
the
growing
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
--
economy
and
the
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
that's
right.
they
are
the
operative
mandates
to
the
policy
and
then
if
--
if
those
operative
mandates
are
pursued
and
followed,
then
your
result
would
be
the
thing
which
the
act
spelled
out.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
that's
right
the
causes
which
are
set
off
by
the
semi-colon
that
precede
the
end
purpose
of
the
policy,
and
that's
what
the
court
below
said
and
it's
an
intelligent,
and
thus
a
very
meaningful
reading
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
adequate?
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
that's
again
very
expressive
of
the
hope
for
end.
that
if
these
things
are
done,
the
transportation
system
as
a
whole
would
be
adequate
for
the
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
no,
sir.
that
follows
if
you're
reading
it
sir
in
the
conclusory
clause
at
the
end
of
the
policy.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
oh
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
right.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
see
that.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes.
well
--
well,
perhaps
so
but
you
can't
--
you
can't
read
adequate
in
the
sense
of
this
provision
in
the
national
transportation
policy
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
15a
(3)
that
--
that
so
far
as
the
congress
was
concerned
that
the
--
the
adequate
transportation
system
would
arise
and
come
out
of
elimination
of
the
commission's
paternalistic
policy.
that's
the
--
that's
the
whole
genesis
of
this
--
of
this
legislative
section
and
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes,
that's
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
well
--
well,
sir
maybe
“hope”
is
not
quite
the
right
word.
perhaps,
you
would
say
that
it's
the
result.
and
as
i
pointed
out
sir
that
when
congress
had
become
convinced
from
time
to
time
that
the
fair
administration
of
the
act
under
the
regulatory
provisions
of
the
statute,
and
under
the
national
transportation
policy
is
not
resulting
in
the
transportation
system
that
meets
the
--
the
desired
result
then,
what
it
has
done
is
to
amend
the
act,
just
like
it
did
in
when
it
incorporated
in
section
15a
(3)
and
i
think
it's
highly
significant
that
the
congress
said
that
the
purpose
of
section
15a
(3)
was
to
provide
a
national
transportation
system
adequate
for
the
defense
and
the
commerce
of
the
nation
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
but
they're
--
they're
of
--
they're
of
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
--
satisfied
below
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
that's
right.
the
commission
utilized
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
--
the
mandate
against
unfair
or
destructive
competitor
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
well
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
well
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
but
sir
you
must
keep
in
mind,
if
i
may
say
so
that
this
national
transportation
policy
is
not
one
of
the
section
of
the
act
as
such.
it's
the
preamble,
the
guideline
of
the
results
that
the
fair
and
impartial
regulation
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
that's
right.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
no.
no
but
the
--
i
agree
with
that.
but
the
fact
that
the
nature
of
the
provision
and
the
type
of
language
it
cast
in
--
in
its
position
in
the
statute.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
right.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
not
sir
what
they
were
previously
doing
broadly
cast,
but
what
they
said
they
would
do
in
the
new
automobiles
case.
the
commission
was
doing
two
things,
as
the
court
below
said
that
they
were
equivocating,
they
were
vacillating.
they
were
using
two
policies
if
you
will
sir
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
i
would
say
this
sir
that
when
they
refer
to
the
national
transportation
policy
in
section
15a
(3),
congress
was
telling
the
commission
that
so
far
as
we,
congress
are
concerned,
the
national
transportation
policy
prohibits
you
the
commission
from
following
your
paternalistic
practices
of
using
artificial
pricing
restraints
to
protect
the
traffic
of
one
mode
from
the
effective
price
reduction
to
the
other.
but
what
the
national
transportation
policy
does
order
you
to
do
is
to
follow
the
rule
which
you
said
you
would
follow
and
in
which
you
have
deviated
from
with
increasing
frequency.
namely,
the
policy
in
the
new
automobiles
case
to
the
effect
that
that
you
will
not
hold
up
the
rates
of
one
mode
to
protect
the
traffic
of
the
other.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
and
if
the
principal
reason
to
put
the
--
referring
to
the
national
transportation
policy
that
mr.
spritzer
pointed
out
was
to
ensure
that
the
commission
would
still
retain
the
power
to
protect
the
inherent
low
cost
advantage
of
one
mode.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
no
sir,
it
is
completely
different
than
the
railroad
originally
--
because
sir
under
the
--
our
reading
of
the
statute,
the
commission
still
has
the
right,
and
indeed
it
has
the
duty
to
consider
the
effect
of
our
reduction
upon
the
other
modes
of
transportation,
and
as
the
court
below
pointed
out
one
of
the
duties
it
had
is
to
protect
the
inherent
low
cost
advantage
of
another
mode.
two
other
district
courts
have
indicated
that
the
commission
has
the
obligation
to
consider
our
price
reduction
to
determine
whether
they're
predatory,
that
is
made
in
the
sense
of
trying
to
destroy
another
type
of
transportation
or
whether
they
would
constitute
a
monopoly
throughout
and
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
and
they've
done
that
sir.
they've
done
that
under
this
very
statute,
the
lower
court
--
no,
sir.
the
congress
has
acted
not
to
take
the
so-called
robinson-patman's
standard
recommended
by
the
secretary
of
commerce.
why?
it's
not
too
clear
but
they
felt
that
the
recommendation
of
commissioner
freas
with
respect
to
the
necessity
of
protecting
the
low
cost
advantage
was
really
what
the
congress
had
in
mind
in
this
situation.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
if
they're
saying
--
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
well,
i'm
saying
in
this
case
sir
that
the
commission
did
not
base
its
decision
in
any
respect
upon
the
preservation
of
a
low
cost
mode.
now,
the
court
below
indicated
that
under
other
circumstances,
the
commission
might
do
that
and
i
was
asked
whether
or
not
this
new
statute
is
the
same
statute
as
the
railroad
originally
has,
when
i
said
it
was
different
because
under
this
statute,
according
to
what
judge
hincks
said
in
his
dictum,
that
the
commission
would
have
the
obligation
to
consider
the
effect
of
our
rates
upon
those
with
our
competitors
in
order
to
protect
the
low
cost
advantage
of
these
competitors.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
it's
not
considered
in
the
light
of
this
case.
the
inherent
advantage
if
you're
talking
from
the
standpoint
of
low
cost
advantage
which
is
the
way
this
court
have
talked
about
it
in
the
shaffer
case,
then
that
is
not
dealt
with
at
all,
because
the
commission's
basis
for
finding
this
rate
unlawful
was
to
preserve
this
other
mode
of
transportation
irrespective
of
its
low
cost
advantage.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
well
the
language
of
--
i'd
be
somewhat
less
than
candid
if
i
would
say
that
the
language
of
the
national
transportation
policy
is
completely
clear
that
the
transportation
legislation
gets
into
the
statute
largely
as
a
matter
of
compromise.
you
get
some
difficult
language,
but
i
would
say
this
is
a
reading
that
the
lower
court
gave
it
and
the
reading
which
we're
suggesting
here,
we
think
it
is
sensible
and
realistic.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
yes.
mr.
carl
helmetag,
jr.
sir,
if
i
may
bring
my
argument
to
a
close
because
i
know
it's
at
the
end
of
the
court's
day
and
maybe
my
friend
on
the
other
side
might
have
a
few
things
to
say,
there
just
two
last
things
that
i'd
like
to
comment
very,
very
briefly
upon
and
first
is
that
the
language
of
the
court
below
and
a
long
discourse
of
court
below
with
respect
to
the
preservation
of
a
low
cost
advantage.
it's
essentially
a
dictum.
it
was
not
the
basis
for
which
the
commission
decided
this
case
and
wasn't
in
this
case.
now
whether
this
court
would
choose
to
endorse
that
or
approve
it,
it's
certainly
not
for
us
to
say.
but
what
we
would
suggest
is
and
we
again
iterate
that
it
is
not
a
basis
for
this
decision
and
we
would
suggest
too
that
if
the
court
were
to
adapt
that
dictum
or
to
approve
it,
that
the
court
not
go
further
and
try
to,
if
i
may
say
this
with
all
due
respect,
layout
guidelines
as
to
how
you
would
have
determine
the
existence
of
a
low
cost
advantage
or
how
the
low
cost
advantage
should
be
protected
assuming
it
was
properly
found.
those
matters
lie
in
the
field
of
cost,
carrier
cost
and
relative
carrier
cost
and
they're
extremely
difficult
and
complex.
there
are
areas
in
which
there's
a
great
deal
of
disagreement
amongst
the
economists
and
accountants
and
we
suggest
that
their
matter
is,
at
least
in
the
first
instance,
are
for
the
expertise
of
the
commission
subject
of
course
to
judicial
review.
and
we
might
say
that
in
expressing
these
views,
we're
doing
nothing
more
than
echoing
what
this
court
said
in
new
york
versus
united
states,
when
it's
indicated
that
the
area
of
cost
and
relative
cost
was
one
particularly
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
in
the
first
instance.
now,
just
by
way
of
conclusion,
we
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
court
below
and
which
set
aside
the
order
of
the
commission
as
unlawful.
