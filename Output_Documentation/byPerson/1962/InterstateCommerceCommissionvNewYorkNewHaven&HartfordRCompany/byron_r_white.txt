are
there
rates
that
are

that
were

you

so
you
have

you
have

you
don't
have

but
that
seems
to
me,
that
argument
does
conceive
the
preservation
of
the
national
defense
is
an
objective
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
justice
byron

[inaudible]
justice

and
in
the
name
of
one
or
two
of
these
that
the
--
some
of
these
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
rates
were
--
justice
byron

white
--
isn't
that
true?
justice
byron

but
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
opposing
mandatory
specifics
to
attain
a
certain
goal.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
rather
strange
to
me
that
the
goal
is
mandatory,
i
mean
in
the
sense
that
--
i
mean
why
put
mandatory
--
what
are
we
trying
to
do
just
--
here,
just
to
attain
some
--
justice
byron

white
--
a
hope
for
a
goal
by
--
justice

might
as
well
make
the

hope
for.
justice

part
of,
yes
(voice

does
not
appeal
from
setting
aside
that
the
rates
below
based
on
one
part
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suggest
it
may
and
perhaps,
when
you
read
15a
(3)
that
all
congress
was
really
doing
was
telling
--
after
all,
the
phase
was
of
over
as
the
different
points
of
view
were
gelled
out
--
justice
byron
r.
white
congress
thought
that
thing,
all
congress'
really
said
was
that
--
and
now
you
subject
what
you
were
--
totally,
i
can
see
this
subjects
to
what
they
were
previously
doing
in
intra-mode
regulation
to
the
national
transportation
policy.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all,
right
they
were
saying
that
the
i.c.c.,
i
suggest
that
--
well,
perhaps
you
have
thought
that
the
national
transportation
policy
isn't
something
that
you
should
have
in
mind
when
you
have
this
inter-modal
problems
in
mind,
before
you,
but
indeed
they
are
something
for
you
to
follow,
now
follow.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
if
you're
going
to
hold
up
rates
of
one
mode
to
protect
another,
you
better
have
one
of
the
reasons
given
to
the
national
transportation
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
regard
to
the
general
goal
of
the
national
defense,
i
take
it
in
effect
to
your
argument
that
it
may
be
true
that
in
order
to
achieve
these
goals
of
the
railroads,
the
commission
could
protect
the
low
cost
mode.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it
may
not
protect
the
national
defense
by
not
protecting
the
low
cost
mode
or
by
doing
damage
to
the
low
cost
mode.
you
are
in
effect
saying
that
the
highest
degree
is
not
recognizing
the
inherent
advantages
of
the
railroad
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
these
rate
stand
--
if
the
i.c.c.'s
actions
stand
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
inherent
advantage
of
the
railroad
is
not
