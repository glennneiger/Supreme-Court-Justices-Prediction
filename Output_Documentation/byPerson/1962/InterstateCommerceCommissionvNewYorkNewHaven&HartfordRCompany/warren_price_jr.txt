mr.
warren
price,
jr.
thank
you,
sir.
if
the
court
please.
i'm
appearing
for
sea-land
service
incorporated
which
was
formerly
known
by
the
name
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation
when
the
commission's
report
below
was
written.
since
the
early
1800's
some
years
before
the
first
railroad
was
constructed,
there
had
been
scheduled
for
hire
coastal
carriers
in
the
united
states,
as
the
commission
found
below,
the
coastal
areas
of
the
country
have,
to
a
substantial
degree,
been
built
about
the
availability
of
this
low
cost
water
service.
sea-land
has
operated
for
about
30
years
as
had
its
sole
remaining
competitor
in
the
coastwise
trade,
seatrain
lines.
excuse
me.
present
time,
seatrain
operates
five
vessels
in
this
trade,
there's
atlantic
coast,
and
atlantic-gulf,
and
sea-land
operates
three
as
a
total
of
eight.
also
to
complete
the
picture,
although
it
has
no
particular
relevance
here,
sea-land
is
now
in
the
process
of
starting
a
service
in
the
inter-coastal
trade.
that
is
between
new
york
on
the
one
hand
and
los
angeles
and
san
francisco
on
the
other.
there
are
two
jumbo
trailer
ships
in
that
service
now.
a
third
will
be
added
at
some
future
date,
a
fourth
if
possible.
i
might
say
that
the
success
of
this
service,
we
think,
will
depend
largely
on
the
outcome
of
this
proceeding.
mr.
ginnane
has
describe
the
matter
in
which
the
sea-land
break-bulk
service
was
converted
to
a
trailer
ship
and
the
fact
that
the
commission
found
that
this
was
an
economical
service
and
resulted
in
substantial
savings
in
cargo
handling
cost.
no
sooner,
however,
had
this
new
service
been
embarked
upon
than
the
railroad
commenced
a
program
of
selective
rate-cutting,
aimed
at
the
traffic
of
sea-land
and
seatrain
which
unless
restrained
would
have
made
those
carriers
completely
noncompetitive
and
unable
to
continue
in
service.
railroads
sought
to
do
this
by
taking
away
the
traditional
differential
and
putting
rates
exactly
the
same
as
the
water
carrier
rates.
the
66
rates
involved
here,
they
termed
pilot
rates
have
indicated
that
if
they
are
successful
here,
they
will
of
course
extend
this
program
to
other
areas.
mr.
warren
price,
jr.
yes
sir,
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
in
just
a
minute.
of
course,
all
of
these
sea-land
and
seatrain
rates
are
competitive
with
the
railroads
and
the
reverse
is
not
true.
now,
after
extensive
hearings,
the
commission
found
that
with
a
spread
of
6%
in
the
rates,
sea-land
and
seatrain
and
the
railroads
would
be
able
to
participate
in
the
available
traffic.
it
was
not
a
question
here,
if
they're
taking
this
traffic
away
from
the
railroads,
they're
merely
putting
the
rates
or
allowing
the
rates
to
be
in
a
relationship
which
will
permit
both
modes
to
compete
for
the
traffic.
now,
on
the
question
of
mr.
justice
goldberg,
we
are
convinced
that
for
a
number
of
reasons
the
water
carriers
would
not
be
able
to
survive
under
this
relative
cost
theory
that
has
been
espoused
by
the
lower
court.
in
the
first
place,
this
court
found
in
united
states
or
in
new
york
versus
united
states,
331
u.s.
284,
transportation
cost
finding
is
a
highly
complex
and
a
very
inexact
science.
cost
planning
entails
many
arbitrary
assumptions
of
fact.
its
results
are
not
susceptible
to
the
mathematical
proof.
but
even
more
important,
however,
cost
finding
is
based
upon
factors
of
a
variable
and
continually
shifting
nature.
the
rail
cost
of
transporting
traffic
from
a
to
b
will
depend
upon
factors
such
as
the
amount
of
traffic
hold
in
the
return
hall,
the
overall
load
factor,
the
type
of
equipment
in
use.
the
cost
of
the
water
carrier
will
depend
upon
factors
such
as
the
gateway
ports
through
which
the
traffic
moves,
the
cost
of
its
connecting
motor
or
rail
carriers
and
the
extended
utilization
of
its
vessels'
load
capacities.
mr.
warren
price,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
warren
price,
jr.
the
full
distributed
cost?
mr.
warren
price,
jr.
both,
your
honor.
specific
land
--
mr.
warren
price,
jr.
that
is
correct.
now,
this
variability
of
the
carrier
cost
was
duly
noted
by
the
commission
in
its
report
below.
if
during
a
particular
study
period,
a
water
carrier
were
found
to
be
the
high
cost
carrier,
then
under
the
court's
opinion,
it
would
not
be
entitled
to
a
differential.
it
would
lose
traffic
immediately
to
the
railroads,
its
load
factor
would
go
down,
it's
unit
cost
up,
and
you'd
have
a
vicious
circle.
they
could
never,
never
regain
their
low
cost
position
if
they
ever
had
it.
we
don't
believe
that
the
congress
and
may
be
presumed
to
have
intended
to
invoke
a
hard
and
fast
system
of
rate-making
based
upon
relative
cost.
the
implementation
of
which
would
inevitably
lead
to
widespread
instability
and
uncertainty.
surely
the
domestic
water
carrier
industry,
all
of
those
traffic
is
competitive
with
the
railroads
and
especially
in
its
present
marginal
status
would
not
be
able
long
to
survive
any
such
period
of
uncertainty.
mr.
warren
price,
jr.
it's
probably
more
applicable,
your
honor,
when
you're
comparing
two
different
modes
of
transportation,
but
there
is
--
my
remarks
do
go
to
the
use
of
cost.
generally,
i
think
costs
have
a
very
definite
place,
particularly
to
in
deciding
what
the
minimum
level
of
a
rate
should
be.
but
when
you
try
to
set
a
complete
rate
system,
a
relative
rate
system
of
two
modes
based
on
relative
costs,
then
i
say
it's
a
very,
very
poor
standard.
now,
if
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
has
sustained
the
rail
rates
would
--
which
are
competitive
with
the
water
carriers
would
all
gravitate
to
levels
reflecting
no
more
than
their
fully
distributed
costs.
now,
sea-land's
full
cost,
were
say
3%
under
to
the
rail
full
cost
on
the
whole,
then
the
sea-land
rates
allowing
for
the
necessary
6%
differential
would
have
necessity
on
the
whole
be
lower
than
the
sea-land
full
cost.
and
of
course,
in
this
circumstance,
sea-land
could
not
in
a
long
run
survive.
moreover,
there's
traffic
moving
by
almost,
it
does
not
and
cannot
move
at
the
full
cost
or
anything
close
to
it.
the
commission
found
that
30%
of
sea-land's
traffic
fell
in
this
category.
now,
sea-land
would
be
precluded
from
sharing
in
this
lower
rated
traffic
because
of
its
probable
inability
to
assess
rates
sufficiently
the
above
its
full
cost
on
other
traffic
if
this
lower
court
opinion
is
sustained.
if
sea-land
is
precluded
from
sharing
at
all
lower
rated
traffic,
why
its
traffic
volume
would
fall
down,
it
would
not
be
able
to
fill
its
vessels
to
the
extent
necessary
for
a
sound
operation.
now,
a
word
about
the
commercial
and
economic
importance
of
deported
coastwise
carriers,
the
court
below
said
that
the
only
economic
importance
of
these
carriers
lies
in
the
fact
that
their
rates
are
cheaper
than
rail,
if
this
advantage
is
taken
away,
their
economic
importance
will
disappear.
we
submit
that
this
is
an
extremely
short
range
view
as
the
commission
found
the
economies
of
many
areas
are
dependent
upon
or
built
about
the
availability
of
low
cost
water
service,
traffic
moves
between
coastal
areas
that
would
not
move
if
it
did
not
have
this
low
cost
service
because
of
market
competition
and
other
reasons.
moreover,
there's
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
if
and
when
the
railroads
are
successful
enforcing
what
remains
of
this
industry
out
of
business,
their
rates
between
the
coastal
areas
will
go
back
to
where
they
were
before.
they
had
this
competition
or
rather
they
will
reflect
the
same
relative
basis
as
the
inland
rates
will.
this
propensity
of
the
railroads
was
recognized
in
the
debates
leading
with
the
transportation
act
of
1920
and
the
transportation
act
of
1958
as
well.
as
testified
by
countless
shippers
and
water
carrier
application
cases
before
the
commission,
and
it
specifically
recognized
in
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1936,
there
is
a
very
real
need
and
demand
on
the
part
of
the
shipping
public
for
deep
water
coastwise
services.
this
extends
far
beyond
a
mere
desire
for
immediate
low
cost
transportation.
on
the
defense
aspect,
i
will
just
like
to
read
from
the
first
section,
declaration
of
policy,
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1936,
“it
is
necessary
for
the
national
defense
to
develop
one
of
its
foreign
and
domestic
commerce
that
the
united
states
of
merchant
marine
sufficient
to
carry
its
domestic
waterborne
commerce,
a
substantial
portion
of
the
waterborne
export
and
import
commerce
and
so
forth.”
in
other
words,
that
is
just
one
of
countless
expressions
by
congress
of
the
defense
on
economic
importance
of
domestic
shipping.
we've
shown
in
our
brief
the
testimony
before
congressional
committees
by
the
deputy
chief
of
naval
operations,
admiral
sylvester
to
the
unique
defense
importance
of
the
coastal
shipping
in
the
advent
of
a
nuclear
attack,
and
also
the
special
importance
of
this
rapid
cargo
handling
type
of
vessel.
during
world
war
ii,
as
one
example,
a
seatrain
vessel
carried
an
entire
division
of
armament
to
montgomery
and
in
africa,
and
that
was
received
quite
of
bit
of
publicity
and
the
same
thing
could
happen
in
the
event
of
another
war.
we
don't
see
that
as
much
more
the
commission
could
have
added
on
the
defense
aspect.
it
seems
to
me,
it's
extolling
the
defense
virtues.
it's
more
or
less
like
extolling
the
virtues
of
motherhood
and
more
or
less
unnecessary.
thank
you.
