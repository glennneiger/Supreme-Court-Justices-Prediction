what's

well,
is
there
any
question
here
that
is
--
was
raised
in
an
opinion
recently,
came
to
us
in
another
case
as
to
whether
including
--
considering
that
cost
value
of
the
property,
they
must
consider
the
investments
made
by
the
government
as
a
part
of
the
investment
cost?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo

black
it's
possible,
is
it
not
if
that's
the
correct
way
to
do
it
that
it
could
come
up?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
would
--
i
understood
that
inherent
advantage
to
means
this,
when
it
was
passed
and
found.
well,
maybe
i'm
wrong,
that
some
carriers
can
go
faster
than
others
and
they
can
render
quicker
service.
shippers
are
operated
to
pay
something
extra
for
that.
the
others
can
carry
at
much
cheaper
flow
and
the
idea
is
that
the
commission
sees
the
one
that
could
carry
at
flow
as
it
could
get
the
traffic
at
a
much
cheaper
rate
was
not
deprived
of
that
by
the
other
--
the
railroad
that
was
in
opposition
so
that
they
could
sell
faster.
that
was
my
understanding
of
what's
meant
by
inherent
advantage.
they
have
an
inherent
advantage
and
had
been
able
to
carry
it
cheaper,
just
as
the
railroads
do
over
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it
here,
the
commission
is
all
on
the
basis
that
the
water
carrier,
carried
by
water
can
be
cheaper,
although
it
may
be
slower,
and
therefore
wants
to
protect
that
inherent
advantage
so
it
won't
be
robbed
of
its
chance
to
carry
that
transportation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
they
find?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
it
need
any
differential
if
they
can't
carry
--
keep
up?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
a
little
confused
by
that.
are
we
to
decide
this
case
then
on
the
basis
that
even
though
the
railroads
can
carry
just
as
cheaply
as
the
water
carriers,
that
the
commission
has
a
power
under
the
aegis
of
inherent
advantage
who
raised
the
prices
of
the
railroad
in
order
to
protect
the
carriers
to
get
transportation
that
they
can't
get
due
to
their
inherent
advantages?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that,
i
would
think
of
as
under
this
last
part
of
the
policy
provision
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
rather
than
the
inherent
advantage
part.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
they
did
not
have
the
right
to
consider
the
national
defense
at
all?
are
you
saying
they
gave
it
too
much
weight?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wholly
improper
you
say?
