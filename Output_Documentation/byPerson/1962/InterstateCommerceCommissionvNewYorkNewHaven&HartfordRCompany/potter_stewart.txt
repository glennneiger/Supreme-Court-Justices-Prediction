justice

you
have
to
make
that
assumption,
that's
the
very
core
of

it?
justice

necessary
predicate

justice

would
i
be
fairly
summing
up
the
commission's
position
if
i
were
to
suggest
they
would
read
that
last
sentence
of
15a
(3)
as
if
it
read
rates
of
carrier
shall
not
be
held
up
to
a
particular
level
to
protect
the
traffic
of
any

of

to
the
extent
as
may
be
necessary
and
the

to
achieve
the
objectives
of
that.
