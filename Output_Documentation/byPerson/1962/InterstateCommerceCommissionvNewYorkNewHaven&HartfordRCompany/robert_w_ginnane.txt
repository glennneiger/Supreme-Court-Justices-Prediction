mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
these
consolidated
appeals,
i
am
sure
in
the
appellant's
time
with
mr.
price,
counsel
for
sea-land
service
and
with
mr.
spritzer,
representing
the
united
states.
these
are
appeals
from
the
decision
and
judgment
of
a
three-judge
court
sitting
in
connecticut,
setting
aside
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
commission's
order
had
directed
the
cancellation
of
66
substantially
reduced
rates
covering
more
than
20
commodities,
which
had
been
proposed
by
several
railroads
for
their
trailer-on-flatcar
service,
referred
to
in
the
record
variously
as
tofc
or
“piggy-back,”
between
points
in
the
east
on
the
one
hand
and
dallas
and
fort
worth,
texas
on
the
other.
this
case
presents
the
first
and
an
important
question
as
to
how
far
section
15a
(3)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
was
added
by
the
transportation
act
of
1958,
how
far
that
restricts
the
commission's
exercise
of
its
minimum
rate
power
to
deal
with
destructive
competition
between
the
different
modes
of
transportation.
the
proposed
rate
reductions
by
the
railroads
in
this
case
were
limited
to
points
served
by
the
only
deep
water
common
carriers
which
remain
in
the
atlantic-gulf
coastwise
trade,
the
two
remaining
ones
are
sea-land
and
seatrain
involved
in
this
case.
sea-land
operates
at
the
present
time,
three
vessels
equipped
with
cranes
and
each
of
these
vessels
can
hold
226
highway
--
demounted
highway
trailers,
by
demounted
i
mean,
the
body
is
lifted
off
the
chassis.
this
enables
sea-land
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
each
of
these
vessels
can
carry
226
demounted
highway
trailers.
this
enables
sea-land
to
provide
a
motor-water-motor
service
in
which
the
loaded
trailers
moved
by
highway
to
the
port
are
lifted
by
the
cranes
under
the
sea-land
ship
at
the
destination
port
are
unloaded
onto
a
chassis
then
moving
by
highway
to
the
ultimate
consignee.
seatrain,
whose
services
have
been
involved
in
litigation
before
this
court
through
the
years
offers
a
rail-water-rail
service
in
which
seatrain
transports
loaded
railroad
cars
between
the
east
coast
ports
and
the
gulf
ports.
traditionally,
water
carrier
rates
including
water
rail
and
motor
rail
have
been
maintained
at
level
below
all-rail
rates.
principally,
because
of
disadvan
--
dis
--
the
inherent
disadvantages
in
the
water
service
due
to
perils
of
the
sea
in
a
less
frequent
sailings
and
perhaps
most
important
slower
transit
time.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
cost
was
decisive
in
the
disappearance
of
the
break-bulk
coastal
services,
which
was
essentially
complete
by
1957.
the
--
the
cargo
handling
cost
of
package
freight
over
the
docks.
now
that
process
of
the
disappearance
of
the
break-bulk
cargo
operations
was
just
about
complete
in
1957
when
sea-land
dropped
its
break-bulk
operations,
and
converted
four
ships
to
the
trailership
--
to
the
trailerships
which
i
have
just
described.
and
that
resulted
in
a
substantial
decrease
in
the
cost
of
the
new
coastal
service.
and
when
sea-land
inaugurated
this
new
trailership
service
in
1957,
it
published
the
rates
which
were
in
general
5%
to
7.5%
below
the
corresponding
all-rail
rates
on
the
same
track.
but
those
differentials
were
less
than
the
differentials
which
they
had
enjoyed
during
the
prior
period
of
break-bulk
operations.
also
in
1957,
and
obviously
in
response,
the
railroads
proposed
to
establish
the
tofc
rates
now
on
issue.
and
they
proposed
them
at
the
same
level
as
the
new
same
level
--
at
the
same
level
as
the
new
sea-land
rates
and
at
approximately
the
level
of
the
seatrain
rates.
from
the
protest
of
the
water
carriers
and
other
persons,
the
commission
suspended
the
proposed
rail
rate
reductions
and
placed
them
under
investigation.
now
we're
here
concerned
only
with
lawfulness
of
this
rail
tofc
rates.
i
emphasized
that
because
the
commission's
report
dealing
with
them
also
covered
other
proceedings
involving
other
rates,
both
rail
and
water,
but
which
are
not
involved
in
the
litigation.
the
commission
found
that
the
proposed
rail
tofc
rates
equal
or
exceed
the
rail
out-of-pocket
cost
for
all
of
the
66
movements
when
they
were
--
when
they
used
ttx
cars.
now,
ttx
car
is
a
car
which
railroads
leased
and
which
will
hold
two
loaded
trailers.
the
commission
also
found
that
the
rail
rates
would
exceed
their
out-of-pocket
cost
and
all
but
6
of
the
64
movements,
from
the
railroads
were
using
their
own
flatcars
which
would
hold
only
one
loaded
trailer.
commission
further
found
that
the
rail
rates
would
exceed
their
fully
distributed
cost
for
43
of
the
66
movements
when
using
the
ttx
cars
that
carried
two
trailers
and
for
14
of
the
66
movements
when
using
railroad
owned
flatcars
which
carry
only
one
trailer.
the
commission
found
that
the
sea
--
that
the
comparable
sea-land
and
seatrain
rates
were
compensatory.
and
that
finding
is
not
challenged
in
this
litigation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
all
it
is
an
issue
here.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
of
the
rates
that
are
above
fully
distributed
cost.
the
court
below
did
not
interfere,
did
not
set
aside
that
portion
of
the
commission's
order
which
required
the
cancellation
of
rates
dealing
less
than
fully
distributed
cost.
now
the
railroads
took
no
appeal
from
that
aspect
of
the
decision
below
and
we
assume
therefore
that
that
aspect
of
the
decision
below
is
not
here
on
issue.
the
cost
evidence
indicated
that
sea-land's
cost,
both
on
an
out-of-pocket
basis
and
an
--
and
on
a
fully
distributed
cost
basis
are
below
the
rail
tofc
cost
for
all
movements
using
the
railroad
owned
cars
and
for
all
but
two
of
the
movements
using
the
ttx
cars.
however,
the
commission
indicated
that
it
was
not
resting
its
decision
in
this
case
and
the
relative
cost
of
the
competing
rail
and
water
carriers.
first,
it
concluded
that
it
couldn't
determine
which
was
the
low
cost
mode
of
transportation
with
any
confidence
because
of
certain
variables
in
the
situation,
such
as
the
extent
of
which
the
railroads
would
be
using
trail
--
ttx
flatcars,
holding
two
cars
--
two
trailers
or
flatcar
which
held
only
one
carrier.
then
it
said
that
we
must
recognize
and
i
quote
the
commission,
“that
cost
is
only
one
of
the
elements
which
maybe
appropriately
considered
and
passing
it
on
the
lawfulness
of
rates.”
and
the
exceptional
circumstances
here
presented
other
considerations
appear
to
us
determined
from
the
issues.
and
they
said
the
most
important
single
issue
as
we
see
it
is
their
destructive
competition
here
involved,
prohibited
by
the
national
transportation
policy.
our
commission
made
the
following
findings
that
because
of
such
factors
as
in
frequency
of
sailings
and
long
--
and
longer
transit
time,
sea-land
and
seatrain
service
are
qualitatively
inferior
to
the
rail
tofc
service,
qualitatively
inferior
in
terms
of
shipper
choice.
it
found
that
all
of
sea-land's
traffic
is
subject
to
rail
competition
and
that
it
must
obtain
its
fully
distributed
cost
on
this
traffic
if
it's
to
continue
on
operation.
it
doesn't
have
a
cushion
of
noncompetitive
traffic.
third,
that
to
attract
traffic,
these
coastal
carriers
must
have
rates
somewhat
below
the
rail
rates.
fourth,
that
there
was
no
contention
that
these
modern
--
two
modern
services
that's
distinguished
from
the
break
--
old
break-bulk
services,
there
was
no
contention
that
they
were
not
efficient
economical
services.
and
finally,
the
commission
found
that
the
reduced
rates
of
the
railroads
hereunder
consideration
are
on
initial
stand
in
an
overall
program
of
rate
reductions
that
can
fairly
be
said
to
threaten
the
continued
operation
and
thus
the
continued
existence
of
the
coastwise
water-carrier
industry,
generally.
now
getting
to
the
legal
heart
of
this
case,
the
commission
recognized
the
potential
applicability,
the
applicability
of
15a
(3).
now
15a
(3)
was
added
in
1958
to
apply
to
competitive
rates
between
the
competing
modes
of
transportation.
it
reads
and
it's
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
it
please
the
court.
after
the
commission
had
made
the
findings
which
i
summarized
just
before
the
recess,
it
turned
to
section
15a
(3)
which
had
been
added
to
the
act
of
1958.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
very
brief.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
on
the
commission's
knowledge
and
on
our
recent
national
experience
and
upon
authoritative
reports,
the
recent
reports
by
the
senate
committee
on
interstate
commerce
and
by
the
maritime
commission
as
to
the
continuing
importance
of
the
coastal
services
in
the
event
of
a
national
emergency.
and
particularly,
the
commission
reminded
itself
that
at
the
outset
of
world
war
ii,
the
entire
coastal
and
inter-coastal
fleet
was
taken
over
by
the
government.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
coastal
fleet
as
a
whole,
including
in
particular
the
tankers,
has
increased
as
an
absolute
matter.
the
coastal
fleet
we're
talking
about
here
in
this
case
and
this
is
all
that's
left
of
the
segment
of
coastal
fleet
are
the
deep
water
carriers
that
is
--
as
distinguished
from
the
small
carriers
that
go
through
the
inter-coastal
canal.
the
deep
water
carriers
that
handled
bulk
cargo.
of
those,
only
two
are
left
and
they're
before
the
court
--
sea-land
and
seatrain
and
they
operate
a
total
of
seven
vessels
in
this
atlantic-gulf
trade,
right
se
at
the
beginning
of
world
war
ii,
there
were
19
carriers
in
this
trade
operating
139
vessels.
of
course,
they
were
139
vessels
in
break-bulk
operation
which
has
disappeared.
the
deep
water
coastal
carriers
carrying
package
cargo
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
distribution

now
consists
of
sea-land
and
seatrain
and
they
operate
in
this
atlantic-gulf
service,
seven
modern
vessels.
sea-lands
carrying
trailers,
seatrains
carrying
loaded
freight
cars.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
each
of
the
sea-land
ships
carries
226
loaded
highway
trailers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
seatrain
i
have
forgotten.
each
seatrain
car
carries
a
hundred
loaded
freight
cars.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
a
fair
reading
on
the
commission's
report
is
they
felt
a
need
to
keep
what
is
still
left.
and
leaving
to
--
in
large
part,
the
competition
whether
or
not
they
would
with
reasonable
differential
rate
protection
to
be
able
to
somewhat
expand
the
services,
because
these
are
pretty
--
this
is
pretty
expensive
equipment.
sea-land
when
it
converted
spent
about
$40
million.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
to
take
a
seatrain
car,
for
example.
a
seatrain
ship
that
can
handle
a
hundred
loaded
freight
cars.
that's
a
pretty
good
size
freight
train
and
depending
upon
the
type
of
future
national
emergency,
perhaps
the
disruption
of
inland
facilities,
here
is
a
vessel
that
can
move
the
equivalent
of
a
loaded
freight
train
in
one
movement
along
the
coast.
and
that
one
seatrain
vessel,
one
sea-land
vessel
correspondingly
can
move
226
loaded
trailers,
stated
otherwise
with
the
present
ships,
their
capacity
would
be
about
1,800,000
tons
a
year.
well,
if
you're
concentrating
on
essentials,
it
could
be
worth
its
weight
in
gold.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
this
is
not
that
dramatic.
this
is
not
that
precise
and
dramatic.
and
of
course
there's
the
further
problem
who,
no
matter
from
what
source
in
the
government
can
predict
with
precision,
what
the
precise
transport
needs
might
be,
and
the
unhappy
the
event
of
a
war
five
or
ten
years
from
now.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
not
that
i
know
of,
and
may
i
put
it
to
you
this
way,
unless,
unless
the
commission
received
authoritative
testimony
that
there
would
be
no
conceivable
national
defense
value
for
these
vessels,
would
it
be
under
any
requirement
to
take
a
gamble.
that
congress
expected
to
take
a
gamble.
there's
an
entitled
in
the
absence
of
authoritative
testimony
of
the
contrary
such
as
no
one
has
ever
offered
to
it,
that
this
type
of
transport
could
be
just
as
essential
in
times
of
emergency
as
it
was
during
the
world
war
ii.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
but
our
brief,
i
may
say
contains
references
and
quotations
from
the
recent
testimony
of
higher
officers
in
the
department
of
defense
before
congressional
committees
where
there's
a
continuing
current
theme
that
of
the
importance
of
a
merchant
marine
and
particularly
of
a
domestic
merchant
marine
whose
ships
would
be
available,
local,
and
available.
15
a
(3)
added
in
1958
provides
that
in
a
proceeding
involving
competition
between
carriers
of
different
modes,
the
commission
in
determining
whether
a
rate
is
lower
than
a
reasonable
minimum
rate
shall
consider
the
facts
and
circumstances
attending
the
movement
of
traffic
by
the
carrier
or
carriers
to
which
the
rate
is
applicable.
and
then
more
specifically
for
this
case,
rates
of
a
carrier
shall
not
be
held
up
to
a
particular
level
to
protect
the
traffic
of
any
other
mode
of
transportation,
giving
due
consideration
to
the
objectives
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
now,
the
commission
recognized
the
introductory
prohibition
against
holding
the
rates
of
one
carrier
up
to
protect
the
rates
of
another
mode.
but
it
felt
that
that
introductory
prohibition
is
qualified
by
the
words
giving
due
consideration
to
the
objectives
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
it
noted
that
that
policy
requires
that
the
act
be
administered
not
only
so
as
to
preserve
and
recognize
the
inherent
advantages
of
the
different
modes
but
also
to
provide
a
national
transportation
system
by
water,
highway
and
rail,
adequate
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
commerce
of
the
united
states,
the
postal
service
and
the
national
defense.
it
took
into
account
and
i
had
just
stated
in
response
to
justice
goldberg's
question
that
the
atlantic-gulf
coastal
shipping
trade
had
declined
from
19
companies
and
139
vessels
just
prior
to
world
war
ii.
the
two
deepwater
common
carriers,
sea-land
and
seatrain
operating
seven
vessels
in
this
trade
and
the
commission
concluded
that
they
represent
an
essential
part
of
a
national
transportation
system
adequate
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
commerce
in
the
united
states
and
the
national
defense.
and
instead
of
those
objectives
required,
the
maintenance
of
a
differential
relationship
between
the
rail
and
the
water
rates
which
would
enable
the
water
carriers
to
maintain
a
rate
structure
which
will
enable
them
to
continue
economical
and
efficient
coastal
services.
now,
the
commission
thought
that
the
10%
differential
rail
over
water
which
sea-land
asked
for
was
excessive
but
in
ordering
with
tofc
rates
cancelled,
the
commission
stated
that
in
its
judgment,
new
tofc
rates
could
be
filed
no
lower
than
6%
above
sea-land's
rates.
and
the
commission's
order
was
without
prejudice
while
the
commission
did
not
prescribe
minimum
rates
its
order
was
without
prejudice
to
the
filing
of
new
tofc
rates,
6%
above
the
sea-land
rates.
the
three-judge
court
in
its
opinion
decision
held
that
the
commission
should
be
enjoined
from
canceling
tofc
rates
which
return
at
least
fully
distributed
cost.
the
commission
held
that
the
requirement
of
a
rate
differential
to
protect
the
water
carriers'
continued
existence,
amounted
to
a
holding
up
railroad
rates
to
protect
another
mode
in
violation
of
section
15a
(3).
and
it
held
that
the
evidence
and
findings
did
not
support
the
commission's
conclusion
that
the
national
transportation
policy
required
that
result.
now,
the
court
held
that
the
national
defense
clause
of
the
national
transportation
policy
is
not
an
operative
policy
factor
but
is
a
hope
for
objective.
and
that
in
any
event
the
commission's
reliance
on
the
national
defense
clause
was
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
the
heart
of
the
court's
decision
seems
to
be
it's
construction
of
section
15a
(3)
as
precluding
the
commission
from
requiring
rail
rates
differentially
higher
than
water
rates,
even
to
preserve
the
water
carriers
from
destruction,
except
where
the
rail
rates
are
so
low
as
to
harm
both
the
rail
and
water
carriers
as
by
a
dissipation
of
the
revenues
of
both
or
where
the
rail
rates
would
deprive
the
water
carriers
of
the
inherent
advantage
of
being
the
low
cost
mode.
so
the
basic
question
here
posed
by
the
decision
below
is
whether
the
section
15a
(3)
prohibits
the
commission
from
setting
aside
selectively
reduced,
but
fully
compensatory
rail
rates
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
a
competing
and
efficient
coastalized
water
carrier
industry,
important
for
national
defense
and
for
the
general
public
use,
without
regard
to
whether
the
water
carriers
are
or
are
not
the
low
cost
mode
of
transportation.
now,
i
have
to
clarify
the
issue
as
i
hope
i
did
in
response
to
justice
white's
question,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
district
court
enjoined
the
commission
from
canceling
all
the
rail
tofc
rates
which
return
at
least
the
rail's
fully
distributed
cost.
district
court's
decision
permits
the
commission
to
require
the
cancellation
of
rail
rates
which
return
less
than
the
rails'
fully
distributed
cost,
even
though
they
returned
more
than
their
out-of-pocket
cost.

robert

mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
or
sometimes
referred
to
as
piggyback.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
there
are
different
systems.
on
some
piggybacks,
systems
are
tofc
systems.
they
load
the
trailer
and
the
chassis,
that
is
the

and
another
type,
the
[inaudible]
type,
the
body
of
the
trailer
is
slit
off
the
chassis
onto
the
flatcar.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
i
should
also
say
sir
that
we
might
have
the
same
result
anyway
by
reason
of
the
last
sentence
of
the
policy
which
says
all
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
be
administered
and
enforced
with
a
view
to
carrying
out
the
above
declaration
of
policy.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
we
don't
even
have
to
rely
on
that,
this
is
made
expressed.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
they
are
like
two
or
three
places
in
the
entire
act
where
there
are
specific
incorporation
in
the
national
transportation
policy.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
for
the
dissenting.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
did
not
base
their
decision
on
the
relative
cost
of
the
carriers.
the
cost
evidence
indicated
that
sea-land
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
at
that
point,
there
were
ten
commissioners,
there
was
one
vacancy.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
so-called
majority
report
which
throughout
this
litigation
is
referred
to
as
the
majority
report
was
concurred
in
by
five.
the
sixth
commissioner,
commissioner
hudson,
concurred
with
a
separate
expression
on
page
43
of
the
record.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
submit
that
we
do
sir.
we
have
five
incurring
in
the
main
report.
and
i
submit
as
a
matter
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
said
that
regardless
of
which
mode
of
transportation
was
the
low
cost.
it
felt
obliged
to
set
aside
rail
rates
even
though
they
covered
fully
distributed
cost
in
order
to
preserve
the
efficient
remnants
of
the
coastal
water
carriers
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
he
was
talking
about
cost
but
he
also
said
i
am
in
general
agreement
for
the
majority
report
and
after
some
discussion,
i
concur.
i
submit
that
his,
that
his
statement
has
to
be
taken
as
having
concurred
with
the
five
to
whatever
extent
was
necessary
to
produce
a
legally
effective
decision.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
he's
saying
that
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
thought
the
majority
had
helped
that
the
sea-land
was
the
low
cost
mode.
actually
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
they
didn't
quite
make
that
finding.
they
recited
that
the
cost
of
–
he
apparently
did.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
four
dissenting
altogether.
well,
the
commission
did
not
base
its
decision
on
relative
cost.
the
cost
evidence
which
is
summarized
in
its
report
indicated
that
sea-land
was
the
lower
cost
service,
both
on
out-of-pocket
and
fully
distributed
cost
basis.
and
that
cost
evidence
as
a
minimum
fully
supported
the
commission's
finding
that
the
coastal
water
carriers
provide
an
efficient
and
economical
coastwise
service.
that
the
commission
has
adhered
not
attempting
to
provide
protection
for
an
obsolete,
absurdly
high-cost
service,
such
as
the
old
break-bulk
service
tended
to
become
with
increasing
costs.
as
a
minimum,
the
cost
evidence
here
at
least
indicates
that
sea-land
is
the
low
cost
service.
the
commission
wouldn't
quite
make
that
finding
because
of
variables
in
the
costing
of
picture.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
if
the
commission
did
not
find
that
they
were
the
low
cost,
they
wouldn't
quite
make
that
finding.
if
they
were
the
low
cost
on
a
fully
distributed
cost
basis
and
then
they
would
of
the
commission's
view
under
the
view
of
the
court
below
have
an
inherent
advantage
over
the
railroads.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
so
there's
no
contention
here
and
no
basis
for
a
contention
that
sea-land
is
not
an
economic
surface.
perhaps,
not
quite
the
low
cost
service
but
very
close
to
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
mean
by
low
cost
on
a
fully
distributed
cost
basis,
all
the
cost.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
these
are
in
terms
of
operating
cost.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
terms
of
operating
cost.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
rather
than
return
on
investment.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
although,
the
commission's
definition
of
costs
includes
a
return
on
investment.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
that
element
--
there
is
no
such
element
in
this
case
at
all.
the
so-called
public
cost?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
there
is
none
of
that
in
this
case.
the
subject
never
came
up.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
has
never
been
raised,
so
far
as
i
know
in
the
case
of
the
rates
of
coastal
carriers.
it
has
come
up
once
in
a
recent
case
in
connection
with
the
operation
of
inland
water
carriers.
everybody
in
the
case
agrees
that
there's
enough
ambiguity
in
section
15a
(3)
and
it's
proper
to
look
at
the
legislative
history.
now,
that's
a
long
legislative
history
in
detail
covering
three
years.
and
i
can
only
hit
--
what
we
think
are
a
few
of
high
spots
of
it,
and
i
won't
represent
that
my
presentation
of
it
is
adequate
and
indeed
it
may
even
be
unfair.
the
story
began
in
1955
for
the
presidential
advisory
committee,
issued
a
report
based
on
the
theme
of
increased
reliance
on
competitive
forces
in
rate-making.
it
recommended,
for
example
the
elimination
from
the
national
transportation
policy
of
the
phrase,
standard
of
destructive
competitive
practice.
that
would
have
come
out
altogether
and
it
was
provided
that
in
determining
whether
a
rate
is
a
less
than
a
minimum
reasonable
rate,
and
i
quote,
“the
commission
shall
not
consider
the
effect
such
charge
and
the
traffic
of
any
other
mode
of
transportation,
or
two,
the
relationship
of
such
charge,
the
charge
of
any
other
mode
of
transportation;
or
three,
whether
such
charge
is
lower
than
necessary
to
meet
the
competition
of
any
automotive
transportation.”
now,
those
three
prohibitions
became
known
colloquially
as
the
three
shall
not's.
and
it's
crystal
clear,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
if
the
congress
had
enacted
the
three
shall
not‘s
and
any
of
the
several
versions
which
were
presented
to
it
at
different
times,
and
at
the
same
time
eliminated
from
the
national
transportation
policy,
the
provision
of
destructive
competitive
practices,
then
the
position
of
the
railroads
and
the
court
below
and
here
would
be
completely
justified.
with
it,
the
most
important
thing
about
the
legislative
history
is
they
didn't
get
the
three
shall
not's
and
they
didn't
get
the
destructive
competitive
practice
clause
out
of
the
national
transportation
policy
of
course
they
supported
it.
it
was
opposed
by
the
commission
and
by
the
motor
and
water
carriers.
the
railroad
struck
the
position
this,
this
will
mean
that
the
commission
cannot
find
unlawful
or
unreasonable
or
destructive
any
rate
that
covers
our
out-of-pocket
costs,
no
matter
what
it
does
to
any
other
mode
of
transportation.
the
commission
pointed
out
that
under
that
approach,
the
railroads
would
in
many
instances
drive
other
forms
of
transportation
out
of
business
and
that
with
the
disappearance
of
competitors,
the
rates
of
the
victors
and
such
a
struggle
would
not
long
remain
on
the
depressed
competitive
basis.
now,
to
compress
that
long
a
legislative
history,
by
1958,
the
presidential
committee
had
withdrawn
its
support
of
the
three
shall
not's,
admitting
that
it
went
too
far.
the
senate
committee
said
it
went
too
far.
and
so
finally,
the
senate
committee
in
1958
reported
the
present
version
of
section
15a
(3),
they
characterized
it
and
since
all
this
paid
work
really
and
this
was
done
on
the
senate
committee.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
they
characterized
it
as
designed
to
encourage
competition
in
transportation
by
allowing
each
form
of
transportation
subject
to
the
interstate
commerce
act,
full
opportunity
to
make
rates
reflecting
the
inherent
advantages
each
has
to
offer
with
such
rate-making
being
regulated
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
prevent
unfair
or
destructive
competitive
practices
as
contemplated
by
the
national
transportation
policy.
now,
those
expressed
mood
that
the
commission
should
more
consistently
permit
each
mode
to
assert
its
inherent
advantages
whether
they
were
cost
or
service.
i
say
an
expressed
mood
because
it
was
a
widespread
agreement
as
to
what
the
commission
had
been
doing
prior
to
1958.
the
railroad
said
the
commission
had
been
engaging
on
what
they
called
umbrella
rate-making,
holding
their
rates
up
artificially
to
protect
the
rates
of
competing
modes.
the
commission
doubted
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
it's
down
the
shipper
choice
in
the
marketplace.
and
you
have
same
thing
as
between
the
rail
and
motor
carrier,
the
more
flexible
services
of
the
motor
carriers
versus
the
cost
advantages
of
over
certain
distances
of
the
railroads
of
balancing.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
here,
what
the
commission
did
was
to
use
that
minimum
rate
power
to
ensure
it
hoped
the
survival
of
the
remaining
efficient
coastal
carriers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
the
basis
on
which
the
commission
works.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
was
the
general
basis
for
the
fact
but
historically,
the
water
carrier
services
have
been
priced
somewhat
lower
than
the
rail.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
commission
did
not
make
a
finding
that
the
water
carriers
are
the
low
cost
mode.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
summarized
cost
evidence
indicating
that
they
might
be
the
low
cost
mode
and
that
they
were
close
enough
to
be
in
the
low
cost
mode
that
they
were
certainly
an
efficient
mode
of
transportation.
this
was
not
some
obsolete
mode
of
transportation
that
needed
massive
differentials
to
keep
it
alive.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
because
there
was
testimony
supporting
the
commission's
finding.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
there
was
testimony
supporting
the
commission's
finding
that
the
service
advantages
of
rail
more
frequent
sailings.
more
frequent
movements,
faster
transit
time
were
such
that
shippers
would
not
utilize
these
coastal
carriers
if
the
rail
rates
were
at
the
same
level.
so
the
commission
found
that
for
them
attract
traffic,
stay
in
business
and
operate
as
efficient
coastal
carriers,
they
had
to
have
a
rate
differential
in
their
rate.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
even
though
the
railroad
costs
are
as
low
as
those
the
water
carriers.
what
the
commission
did
here
was
to
rely
on
the
national
defense
and
commerce
clauses
of
the
national
transportation
policy
to
say
that
notwithstanding
that
cost
relationship,
we
think
that
these
remaining
coastal
carriers
should
be
given
a
price
differential
protection
which
will
keep
them
in
business.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
that's
what
the
commission
did
here
because
it
stated
flatly
that
it
was
not
basing
its
decision
on
the
relative
cost.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes
sir,
one
qualification
and
admittedly
efficient
carrier.
we
are
not
trying
to
preserve
in
our
kayak
mode.
we
urge
more
strongly
that
the
court
below
erred
in
holding
that
the
national
defense
was
not
an
operative
clause
of
the
national
transportation
policy,
but
i've
summarized
our
position
on
that
briefly
in
response
to
question
for
mr.
justice
goldberg,
and
for
the
rest
i
would
submit
it
on
our
brief.
i'd
like
to
leave
just
one
thought.
the
brief
of
the
national
industrial
traffic
league
and
of
the
department
of
justice
suggest
that
shippers
are
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
inherent
advantage
railroads
may
have
to
produce,
to
provide
a
lower
rate
even
though
these
coastal
carriers,
whose
presence
and
competition
evoked
the
lower
rates,
that
that's
an
inherent
advantage
to
which
the
shipping
public
is
entitled.
to
paraphrase
the
commission's
testimony
before
the
senate
in
1958,
i
suggest
that
that
in
such
an
inherent
advantage
would
not
long
be
enjoyed
by
the
shipping
public
after
these
coastal
carriers
had
disappeared.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
chief
justice.
i'll
be
very
brief.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
certainly.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
first
i'd
like
to
associate
myself
with
the
last
remarks
of
mr.
helmetag
on
behalf
the
railroads.
we
feel
with
him
that
some
of
that
detailed
discussion,
methods
of
cost
determination
and
so
on
in
the
lower
court's
opinion
is
dictum
at
least
in
the
sense
that
it
wasn't
briefed
and
argued
by
the
parties,
and
by
any
of
the
parties,
and
they
are
complicated
and
disputed
matters
which
i
think
it
would
be
unfortunate
if
it
turned
out
to
be
generally
regarded
as
binding
most
upon
the
industry
and
upon
the
commission.
second
that
--
on
pages
39
and
40
our
brief,
we
refer
to
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
as
to
the
steady
flat
rate
and
as
this
court
did
in
united
states
v.
capital
transit
with
325
u.s.
and
i
quote,
“congress
unequivocally
reserved
to
the
commission
power
to
regulate
the
recent
openness
of
interstate
rates
in
the
light
of
the
needs
of
national
defense.”
now,
that
was
after
the
enactment
of
the
national
transportation
policy
and
i
know
of
not
a
word
in
the
legislative
history,
in
the
1958
amendment
that
purported
to
undo
that.
and
similarly,
we
don't
know
of
anything
in
the
1958
legislative
history
which
indicates
a
purpose
on
the
part
of
congress,
to
undo
that
whole
portion
of
the
structure
of
the
1940
act,
particularly
those
provisions
relating
to
water
carriers,
water
carrier
rates,
305
and
307.
that
portion
of
the
1940
structure
from
which
of
this
court
found
in
the
series
of
cases
beginning
with
mclean,
coming
down
to
dixie
carriers
that
there
was
a
persistent
national
policy,
congressional
policy,
to
preserve
or
if
possible
efficient
water
carrier
service
for
the
nation.
thank
you.
