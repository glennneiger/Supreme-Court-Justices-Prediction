mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case,
as
we
see
it,
is
a
very
simple
but
a
very
practical
one.
when
a
mistake
is
made
by
someone
in
a
local
land
office
in
granting
one
of
the
thousands
of
applications
for
leases
that
come
requiring
almost
monthly,
a
mistake
that
violates
the
department's
regulations
and
that
defeats
the
prior
right
of
another
applicant,
may
the
secretary
correct
the
mistake
as
soon
as
it's
brought
to
his
attention,
refund
the
rental
and
give
the
lease
to
the
person
entitled
thereto.
now,
the
court
below
held
that
he
may,
petitioner
argues
that
he
may
not
either,
i'm
not
quite
clear
on
this,
either
because
there
is
no
power
at
all
to
cancel
a
lease
once
issued
which
some
of
his
argument
had
seem
to
lead
to
or
because
it
must
be
done
in
judicial
proceeding.
in
either
event,
we
submit,
that
the
secretary
has
the
administrative
power.
because
this
is
a
question
of
great
housekeeping
or
at
management
importance
to
the
interior
department,
and
because
it
has
a
very
pragmatic
argument,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
first
the
nature
of
the
land
office's
business
and
the
way
these
questions
arise.
the
management
of
the
public
domain
involves
thousands,
literally
thousands
of
repairing
decisions
taken
almost
daily.
upon
claims,
surveys,
inquiries,
applications
of
various
arts
requirements
and
also
applications
for
leases.
the
transactions
have
to
be
handled
initially
by
one
of
the
scattered
local
land
offices
around
the
county,
who
would
keep
the
tract
books,
the
serial
registers
and
other
records
pertaining
to
the
land
and
the
various
claims
against
it.
under
the
--
under
the
statute
including
the
mineral
leasing
act,
the
land
offices
act
really
as
real
estate
managers,
keeping
charge
of
this
property.
under
the
mineral
leasing
act,
they
process
applications
or
issue
leases,
or
approve
or
disapprove
request
for
the
assignment
of
leases
and
extensions
of
the
term,
they
supervise
their
performance,
the
drilling
and
so
forth.
on
june
30,
1960
for
example,
there
were
139,000
leases
outstanding
under
the
mineral
leasing
act
alone,
not
taking
into
account
all
the
leases
under
taylor
grazing
act,
other
mineral
claims,
homestead
entries
and
the
like.
only
this
two
is
only
a
part
of
the
local
land
offices
business.
for
example,
one
land
office
received
10,000
applications
in
a
single
month
for
leases
under
the
mineral
leasing
act.
i
think
that
is
not
a
representative
month
but
it
does
show
the
volume
of
business.
there
were
50,000
leases
issued
in
a
three-year
period.
during
six
months
recently,
there
were
6,000
leases
issued.
so
that
you
can
see
the
volume
of
the
transactions
just
under
the
mineral
leasing
act
which
is
part
of
the
business
that
this
local
land
offices
carry
on.
now,
in
the
conduct
of
(inaudible)
applying
in
enterprise,
some
mistakes
are
bound
to
occur
and
the
question
arises,
how
are
those
mistakes
to
be
corrected?
usually,
by
some
superior
officer
to
whose
attention
the
facts
are
later
brought.
the
common
sense
answered
given
by
both
experience
and
history
is
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
should
have
the
power
to
correct
the
mistake
by
canceling
the
improper
action
in
the
local
office.
the
power
has
been
used
to
cancel
improper
mining
clients,
homestead
entries,
timber
entries,
improper
survey,
improper
lieu
land
selections,
improper
leases
under
the
taylor
grazing
act
and
the
improper
leases
under
the
mineral
leasing
act.
in
the
three-year
period
1958,
1960,
there
were
1,100
administrative
cancellations
of
leases
under
the
mineral
leasing
act.
this
was
about
2%--
mr.
archibald
cox
in
the
three-year
period.
mr.
archibald
cox
1,100.
that
was
about
2%,
mr.
chief
justice,
of
the
leases
that
were
issued
during
that
period,
so
the
other
98%
were
free
to
go
ahead.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
have
the
breakdown
but
i'm
sure
that
some
of
them
were,
yes.
because
they
went
--
some
of
them
went
to
reported
decisions
so
they
must
have
been
contested.
i
suspect
but
i
cannot
speak
of
knowledge,
i
suspect
that
a
great
many
of
them,
everyone
acknowledge
a
mistake
and
that's
a
fact
because
the
power
has
been
repeatedly
exercised
for
at
least
15
years.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
of
course
the
statute
was
enacted
at
the
time
mineral
leases
were
set
up.
the
statute
as
i
shall
develop
a
little
later,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
provisions
in
the
statute
were
intended
to
give
the
secretary
a
no
indifferent
power
that
he
would
not
otherwise
have
had.
there
are
quite
in
our
view,
quite
clearly
edited.
you
will
recall
that
at
common
law,
a
lessor
does
not
have
the
right
to
forfeit
a
lease
for
a
breach
of
the
covenants,
the
failure
performance
by
the
lessee.
and
what
the
statute
is
concerned
within
this
provision,
is
overwhelmingly
causes
that
would
arise
in
the
future
performance
of
the
lease.
so
this
gave,
in
our
view,
a
substantive
power
that
he
would
not
otherwise
have
had
in
a
forum
in
which
to
perform.
it
added
to
what
was
already
there.
it
was
not
intended
to
be
exhausted
and
i
take
in
the
context
of
the
common
law,
it
makes
perfectly
a
good
sense.
you
have
to
add
otherwise
you
wouldn't
have
had
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no.
there
were
about
--
my
priority
is
taking
the
general
law
of
landlord
and
tenant
that
there
isn't,
unless
you
reserve
it
in
the
lease
or
unless
there's
a
state
statute,
you'll
recall
there's
no
power
to
cancel
for
failure
to
pay
rent,
for
failure
to
perform
the
covenants
there.
mr.
archibald
cox
under
the
placer
mining
act,
placer
mining
claims.
mr.
archibald
cox
these
were
all
placer
claims
and
that
was
resulting
in
great
ways
of
the
public
domain.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
mineral
entries
were
characteristically
cancellable
in
the
department
of
interior.
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
of
the
two
that
i'm
familiar
were
taylor
grazing
act
and
mineral
leasing.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
there
is
not.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
informed
there
is
not.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
all
these
cancellations,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
mr.
chief
justice,
the
power
to
cancel
any
adverse
claim
against
the
public
land
has
been
recognized
for
centuries,
so
long
and
under
the
general
statutes
creating
the
department
of
the
interior.
so
long
as
the
land
is
part
of
the
public
domain
and
this
land,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
suggested
earlier,
remains
in
the
public
domain.
so
that
we
think
that
the
claim
here
is
no
different
than
of
placer
mining
claim
was
under
the
old
law,
homestead
entry,
swamp
land
selection,
other
adverse
claims.
now,
once
the
land
passes
wholly
out
of
the
public
domain
as
it
does
in
the
case
of
a
patent
then
we
would
have
to
concede
that
the
secretary's
remedy,
in
a
case
of
fraud
or
mistake
was
to
go
to
court.
but
as
the
court
had
said
in
the
cameron
case
and
which
was
quoted
in
mr.
justice
douglas'
opinion
in
best
against
humboldt
mining.
the
general
authority
of
the
secretary
has
been
held
to
constitute
the
land
office
or
the
land
department
and
ultimately
the
secretary
as
the
head
of
that
department,
as
a
tribunal
not
just
a
lessor
but
a
tribunal
for
adjudicating
all
claimed
interest
in
lands
that
are
part
of
the
public
domain
and
these
lands
remained
part
of
the
public
domain.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
a
lease
issued
under
the
provisions
of
this
act
may
be
forfeited
and
canceled
by
an
appropriate
proceeding
in
the
united
states
district
court,
whenever
the
lessee
fails
to
comply
with
any
of
the
provisions
of
this
act
of
the
lease
or
of
the
general
regulations
promulgated
under
the
act.
i
think
that
the
mind
of
the
congress
was
overwhelmingly
focused
on
the
obligations
that
were
being
created
by
the
act
with
respect
to
future
performance
by
the
lessee
and
with
respect
to
regulations
relating
to
future
performance
by
the
lessee.
and
that
the
provision
was
put
in
as
i
suggested
a
moment
ago
for
the
purpose
not
of
curtailing
the
secretary's
power
but
for
the
purpose
of
giving
him
this
additional
power
to
forfeit
for
causes
arising
after
the
lease
was
executed
which
he
would
not
have
had
either
under
the
general
land
law
applicable
to
the
department
of
interior
or
under
the
general
principles
applicable
to
the
rights
of
landlord
and
tenant.
and
now,
the
language
is
a
little
broader
and
happens
to
overlap
with
a
power
under
the
general
statute,
i
think
that
does
not
destroy
the
force
of
my
argument
because
i
think
i've
shown
the
situation
toward
which
this
was
direct.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
the
one
i
just
read
is
not
--
it's
what
i
was
describing
as
the
additive
language,
isn't
that
the
first
time
here?
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
no.
let
me
--
let
me
go
back
and
explain
that
that
isn't
what
i
meant
by
the
additive
power.
mr.
archibald
cox
may
i
back
up
a
little
and
get
this
in
context
because
i
think
that's
part
of
the
reason
that's
given.
as
i
indicated
a
moment
ago,
we
find
the
source
of
this
power
in
the
general
statutes
creating
the
land
office
and
the
department
of
the
interior.
as
43
u.s.c.
section
2,
gives
the
secretary
of
the
interior
power
to
perform
--
he
shall
perform
all
executive
duties
appertaining
to
the
surveying
and
sale
of
the
public
lands
of
the
united
states
or
in
anywise
respecting
such
public
lands
and
also
such
as
relates
to
private
claims
of
land
and
so
forth.
now,
we
say
that
under
that
and
the
other
general
statute
for
century,
it
has
been
held
at
the
department
of
the
interior,
it
is
the
tribunal
for
determining
all
claims
of
interest
in
public
land.
and
if
for
more
than
a
century,
the
secretary
has
held
--
been
held
to
have
power
to
correct
mistakes
and
to
cancel
adverse
interests
that
were
based
on
improper
action.
and
this
it
seems
as
to
us
is
sustained
by
the
language
from
the
cameron
case
quoted
in
our
brief
and
also
quoted
here
in
best
against
humboldt
mine.
so
it's
a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
may
i
come
to
that
in
chronological
sequence?
mr.
archibald
cox
i
will
come
to
this
preferably
in
mind.
the
things
that
were
clearly
exercised
did
not
include,
for
a
reason
i'll
explain
in
a
moment,
mineral
leases
but
they
did
include
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
every
kind
of
claim
then
existing
which
could
be
made
against
lands
still
in
the
public
domain
and
the
expressions
say
that
the
secretary
loses
his
power
only
when
the
land
passes
out
of
the
public
domain.
and
it's
been
applied.
i
listed
in
the
various
kinds
of
things.
so
i
think
the
first
part
to
be
emphasized,
mr.
justice
harlan
is
that
we
think
the
question
is
misstated
by
petitioner.
the
question
is
not
whether
the
secretary
has
power
under
section
1
of
the
mineral
leasing
act,
we
find
the
power
in
the
general
statute
and
once
it
is
established
that
the
secretary
has
that
power
under
the
general
statute
then
section
31
becomes
relevant
only
if
it
in
someway
takes
away
the
power
that
would
otherwise
exist.
now,
i'll
come
directly
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
general
statutes
appear
--
mr.
archibald
cox
beginning
at
page
--
mr.
archibald
cox
43
of
our
brief.
the
mineral
leasing
act
which
was
adopted
in
1920
said
--
set
up
what
was
then
an
entirely
no
system
with
respect
to
the
disposition
of
mineral
lands
because
contrast
--
conservation
is
appreciated
that
they
were
being
wasted
away
under
the
old
statute.
our
theory
of
section
31
which
was
originally
enacted,
mr.
justice
harlan,
only
with
that
first
paragraph
in
it,
is
that
that
first
paragraph
is
additive
that
it
gives
the
secretary
--
gives
the
secretary
as
plaintiff,
the
right
to
go
into
court
to
cancel
a
lease
for
breach
of
covenant
or
for
breach
of
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
which
lay
duties
on
the
lessee
much
as
if
the
were
a
covenant.
they
apply
overwhelmingly
not
exclusively.
i
don't
want
to
state
it
but
overwhelmingly
to
duties
resting
on
the
lessee
after
the
lease
has
been
executed
and
that
causes
for
forfeiting
the
lease.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no
because
there
are
duties
put
on
the
lessee
in
the
statute.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
are
not
in
the,
not
in
the
lease
but
they
relate
to
future
performance.
the
provisions
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
the
question
would
be
open
to
argument
that
a
lease,
the
normal
rule
was
that
the
lessee's
nonperformance
of
obligations
unless
the
lessor
was
given
the
power
of
forfeiture
somewhere
that
it
was
not
existing.
mr.
archibald
cox
those
are
regulations
that
refer
to
regulations
to
be
issued
under
the
statute.
of
course
there
were
not
at
the
time
congress
referred
to
and
used
the
word,
“regulation.”
again,
i
would
say
that
the
use
of
the
word,
“regulations,”
was
necessary
to
cover
violations
of
the
regulations
in
the
future
after
the
lease
had
been
issued.
i
think,
as
i
said
earlier,
i
don't
want
to
overstate
it.
i
think
that
there
is
some
overlapping.
now,
we
say
not
only
does
this
make
sense
as
something
additive
giving
the
secretary
an
additional
power.
but
that
the
petitioner's
reading
obviously
proves
too
much
as
the
court
brought
out
in
the
questioning.
suppose
that
the
secretary
leases
land,
which
has
been
set
aside
for
an
executive
order
for
the
indians
or
for
a
reservoir
something
like
that
by
mistake.
suppose
this
was
suggested
during
the
argument
that
somebody
in
the
local
land
office
is
bribed
and
issues
a
lease
to
valuable
oil
lands
within
a
known
geological
structure.
and
by
a
simple
noncompetitive
lease
in
violation
of
the
statute
regulation
instead
of
after
competitive
bidding
as
the
statute
requires
in
the
case
of
land
within
a
known
geological
structure.
if
you
--
if
the
secretary
is
confined
to
the
power
given
by
section
31,
it
is
--
not
only
could
he
not
cancel
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
some
of
those
cases
no
one
could
cancel.
in
other
words,
if
you're
going
to
read
a
negative
fragment
into
section
31,
it
requires
taking
away
from
the
secretary
a
power
to
cancel
for
fraud,
for
bribery,
for
other
overreaching,
or
inadvertent
waste
of
the
public
land
or
whether
it
isn't
any
violation
of
the
statute,
or
where
you
would
have
to
read
a
great
many
undertaking
into
this
statute
or
limitations
into
the
statute
that
aren't
there
in
so
many
terms.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
find
it
--
i
would
think
that
what
quite
would
be
--
could
be
in
cause.
but
i
would
think
the
more
natural
thing
to
do
was
to
say
that
congress
when
it
enacted
this
statute,
put
it
down
into
an
existing
legal
framework
and
one
of
the
rules
of
the
existing
legal
framework
is
that
you
can
cancel
a
lease
for
fraud
or
that
you
cancel
it
for
coercion,
or
for
bribery,
other
brief
in
(inaudible).
now
i
say
here
by
exactly
parallel
reason
that
one
of
the
things
in
the
existing
legal
framework
was
a
power
to
cancel
all
less
than
fee
interest
for
mistake,
especially
a
mistake
by
a
subordinate
in
--
officer
in
the
issuance.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would.
i
guess
it
would
depend
as
a
practical
matter,
would
it
not,
whether
he
had
surrendered
possession.
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
of
course,
with
these
cases,
the
secretary
does,
even
if
he'd
go
into
court,
he
would
have
to
take
some
preliminary
step
to
determine
when
he
would
go
to
court
and
when
he
wouldn't
go
to
court.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
all
the
arguments
about
the
inconvenience
of
the
lessee
are
just
as
serious
where
he
goes
to
the
court
--
announces
he
is
going
to
court,
as
they
are
where
he
announces
and
administered
to
cancellation.
i
might
make
it
plain
at
this
point
what
i
hope
to
say
earlier
in
claiming
the
power
to
cancel
of
course
we
do
not
claim
that
this
is
an
untrammeled
discretion.
the
secretary
is
bound
by
his
own
rules.
there
is
also
provision
to
a
very
considerable
judicial
review.
so
that
this
is
really,
may
he
in
the
first
instance,
wipe
out
this
mistake.
now,
justice
harlan,
let
me
come
to
the
second
part
of
section
1.
and
there
i
think
that
i
can
deal
with
that
and
with
the
problem
of
history
of
the
administrative
interpretation
about
which
the
chief
justice
asked
at
the
second
time
or
at
least
it
was
on
sequence.
as
the
act
was
originally
enacted
in
1920,
there
were
so
far
as
oil
lands
are
concerned,
really
two
kinds
of
transactions
in
which
private
citizens
were
interested.
one,
was
the
lease.
the
lease
was
used
for
lands
--
primarily
for
lands
that
did
have
petroleum
reserves.
the
other
thing
you
might
get
would
be
an
exploration
permit.
a
power
to
go
on
the
land
and
explore
and
the
reason
that
second
paragraph
of
section
31
was
not
in
the
original
act,
justice
harlan,
it
is
because
you
didn't
have
the
kind
of
noncompetitive
lease
before
oil
is
discovered,
at
least
not
to
the
same
extent
but
you
did
have
asked
in
1935.
you
simply
have
the
exploration
permit.
now,
with
respect
to
exploration
permits,
the
original
statute
gave
the
secretary
power
to
cancel
an
exploration
permit
for
failures
with
section
26,
for
failure
to
exercise
due
diligence
in
the
prospecting
work
in
accordance
with
terms
and
conditions
stated
in
the
permit.
and
the
same
question
might
have
arisen
then
about
section
26
which
has
been
raised
now
about
the
first
paragraph
of
section
31.
is
this
exclusive?
does
this
mean
that
they
say
impliedly
through
a
negative
fragment
that
the
secretary
may
not
cancel
an
oil
prospecting
permit
for
any
other
reason
than
for
failure
to
exercise
due
diligence
in
prospecting
work,
not
for
fraud,
not
for
mistake,
etcetera?
well,
the
fact
is
that
i
come
now
to
the
administrative
interpretation,
that
from
1920
until
1935
as
long
as
prospective
permits
were
issued,
the
secretary
did
assert
the
power
to
cancel
prospective
permits.
i'm
afraid
in
my
brief
i
was
guilty
of
that
--
some
of
our
argument.
we
equated
permits
and
leases
and
during
the
1920,
1935
period
we
should
not.
but
the
permits
were
regularly
cancelled
during
that
period.
there
were
during
that
same
period,
mr.
chief
justice,
a
number
of
leases
issued
for
where
those
lands
where
there
was
known
to
be
oil.
i'm
making
a
rough
division
here.
i
don't
pretend
it's
precisely
accurate
but
it's
substantially.
there
were
a
number
of
leases
issued.
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
the
only
--
the
question
of
cancellation
was
mentioned
in
only
one
case,
the
melish
case
for
which
my
brother
quote.
in
fact,
the
secretary
determined
in
that
case
that
there
was
in
any
event
no
cause
for
cancellation
that
was
wronged
and
deterred.
there
is,
as
i
read
it,
but
my
friends
in
the
department
of
interior
disagree,
what
i
would
call
a
dictum
to
the
effect
that
there
was
no
power
to
cancel
an
oil
lease,
which
meant
a
lease
that
now
corresponds
to
the
lease
after
competitive
bidding.
but
in
any
event,
that's
the
only
expression
up
to
that
time
that
i
think
we
should
acknowledge
there
is
a
dictum
that
certainly
looks
against
this
but
it
was
a
clear
dictum.
also,
i
cannot
claim
that
as
to
that
time,
the
power
to
cancel
leases
was
exercised.
in
1935,
provision
was
made
to
cancel,
to
do
away
with
the
system
of
exploration
permits
and
it
was
at
that
time,
justice
harlan,
that
there
was
put
into
the
statute,
this
second
paragraph
of
section
31
which
was
intended
to
give
the
secretary
a
power
with
respect
to
none
--
bad
conduct
in
the
future,
if
i
may
put
it
colloquially.
with
respect
to
the
noncompetitive
leases
are
only
a
part
of
that
leases
where
no
oil
and
gas
had
been
discovered.
corresponding
to
his
power
to
cancel
a
permit
for
failure
to
exercise
due
diligence
was
brought
somehow
but
i
think
it
was
essentially
the
same
thing.
it
came
in
at
that
time.
now,
we
say
that
it
is
--
it
seems
to
me
really
quite
unthinkable
that
congress
by
that
second
paragraph
had
any
intention
to
deny
the
secretary
with
respect
to
noncompetitive
leases.
a
power
that
he
had
been
exercising
with
respect
to
their
predecessor's
exploration
permits
for
roughly
15
years
and
the
power
that
he
had
been
exercising
with
respect
to
every
other
kind
of
interest
of
land
still
in
the
public
domain,
land
not
patented
for
at
least
a
century.
to
read
that
much
negative
fragment,
it
seems
to
me
to
go
contrary
to
the
whole
history
of
our
notion
that
the
department
of
interior
is
the
special
tribunal
for
dealing
with
public
lands
where
there
are
many
rapid
transactions
in
an
administrative
capacity.
now,
let's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
throws
as
far
as
i
know
that
throws
any
light
on
that.
i
find
that
the
approaching
date
of
oral
argument
has
a
way
of
sharpening
one's
mind,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
the
legislative
history,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
deal
for
just
a
moment
with
the
legislative
history
and
then
if
i
may
come
back
to
the
practicalities
of
this
situation
and
then
i'll
be
done.
there's
certainly
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
contrary
to
our
interpretation.
now,
mr.
benezra
cites
in
his
brief,
a
little
snippet
from
the
legislative
history,
where
senator
lenroot
said
that
the
secretary
has
a
right
or
authority
under
the
bill
--
under
the
bill
to
cancel
a
lease
and
it's
true,
he
did
utter
those
words.
but
if
you
will
go
to
the
context
in
58
cong.
rec.
4168,
you'll
find
that
it
really
throws
no
light
at
all
on
this
problem.
now,
the
colloquy
arose
because
senator
walsh
of
massachusetts
was
concerned
about
two
things.
in
the
first
place,
he
wondered
whether
somebody
shouldn't
have
authority
to
fix
the
price
for
oil
and
gas
coming
from
government
leases.
and
in
the
second
place,
he
was
worried
about
what
would
happen
when
the
secretary
exercised
his
power
to
cancel
a
lease
for
the
reason
stated
in
section
31,
in
other
words,
for
future
nonperformance.
and
with
respect
to
the
second,
he
said,
well,
why
shouldn't
the
secretary
--
may
i
ask
the
senator
--
addressing
senator
lenroot
and
senator
smoot,
state
whether
he
has
any
objection
to
an
amendment,
giving
the
government
authority
to
operate
a
well
where
there's
a
lease
in
existence
which
the
secretary
of
interior
cancel
it.
mr.
lenroot
said,
which
he
has
can
--
which
he
has
cancelled
because
of
a
violation
of
its
terms,
mr.
walsh,
yes.
mr.
lenroot,
i
have
no
objection
but
mr.
smoot
said
he
did
have
objections
and
that
there
was
already
a
provision
of
the
bill
dealing
with
it.
and
he
said
the
bill
already
takes
care
of
this,
i
don't
want
to
add,
senator
mckellar
asked
what
it
is
and
there
was
further
discussion
about
who
should
do
what
and
then
mr.
lenroot
said
who
had
sort
of
dropped
out
of
the
conversation.
i
should
like
to
suggest
to
both
senators
that
the
secretary
of
interior
has
no
right
or
authority
under
the
bill
to
cancel
a
lease.
well,
all
he
was
doing
was
saying
that
you've
been
discussing
this
section
on
the
assumption
that
the
secretary
does
it
but
he
doesn't,
it's
the
court.
i
don't
think
he
was
expressing
any
opinion
and
certainly
no
conscious
opinion
as
to
the
effect
of
this
bill
on
the
general
existing
power
of
the
secretary
over
the
lands
of
the
public
domain.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
the
bill
that
became
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
i
see
that
by
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
point
--
the
point
that
i
was
seeking
to
develop
at
the
beginning
mr.
chief
justice,
was
the
very
large
volume
of
transactions,
necessarily
undertaking
in
the
local
land
offices
in
grabbing
applications
of
various
kinds
whether
under
the
taylor
grazing
act
or
the
mineral
leasing
act.
and
that
mistakes
--
you're
just
human
to
make
mistakes,
2%
of
mistakes
in
a
transaction
of
this
kind,
of
this
volume
is
perhaps
a
little
larger
than
it
should
be
but
it's
within
human
nature
i
think
to
do.
now,
sometimes
the
power
to
correct
the
mistake
is
of
great
importance
in
the
public
interest.
this
would
certainly
be
true
if
valuable
oil
lands
were
given
out
by
mistake
under
a
noncompetitive
lease.
it's
certainly
would
be
true
if
it
was
bribery
or
corruption
of
some
kind.
it
would
seem
to
be
true
with
reserve
lands,
indian
lands,
somebody
else's
land
were
given
out.
some
power
quickly
and
expeditiously
to
correct
mistakes
must
exist
to
protect
public
interest.
the
other
side
of
it
is
that
there
are
additional
cases
in
which
the
power
quickly
to
correct
mistake
is
of
great
importance
to
competing
private
interest
and
it
was
that
mr.
chief
justice
if
i
could
just
take
a
minute
to
develop.
because
this
case
illustrates
how
the
problems
arise
and
why
some
reviewing
authority
is
necessary.
there
are
as
i
said
large
volume
of
leases
left
under
the
mineral
leasing
act.
it's
not
possible
to
give
a
lease
either
under
the
mineral
leasing
act
or
the
taylor
grazing
act
in
the
same
manner
that
you're
awarded
television
channel
or
a
certificate
for
an
air
route.
there
are
thousands
of
them
to
be
done
over
and
over
again.
and
there
is
no
opportunity
at
that
stage
without
delaying
the
whole
public
business
for
a
hearing
noticed
to
opposing
claimants
and
opportunity
for
argument
and
appeal.
as
a
practical
matter,
what
is
done
and
i
think
it's
about
as
good
a
system
that
one
could
device.
what
is
done
is
the
local
office
gets
these
thousands
of
applications
pouring
in
and
it
goes
through
them
in
chronological
order.
it
knows
there
are
other
applications
there,
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
but
it
doesn't
know
quite
what
other
applications
or
what
land
they
have.
and
it
takes
up
the
first
application
in
point
of
time.
it
was
defective
for
some
reason,
the
applicant
is
notified
and
you
go
on
to
the
next.
presently,
you
come
to
the
application
--
an
application
where
the
land
is
available
or
the
applicant
is
qualified,
the
application
meets
the
statute
or
regulation
and
then
it's
granted
in
the
local
office
then
and
there.
now,
that's
what
happened
in
this
case,
except
that
the
local
office
made
a
gross
error,
the
writ
that
is
paid
in
this
case,
justice
white
was
50
cents
an
acre
for
the
first
year.
in
other
words,
$40,
nothing
for
the
second
year,
nothing
for
the
third
year,
25
cents
for
the
fourth
and
fifth
year
and
then
it's
renewed
the
lease
in
order
to
halt.
it's
been
found
out
that
this
is
within
a
known
geological
structure.
that's
why
you
got
this
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
the
application
and
therefore
the
applicant
did
not
conform
to
the
regulations,
it
was
a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
didn't
apply
for
the
required
size.
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
think
this
could
be
brought
in
under
those
terms.
as
i've
said
earlier,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
fairly
what
they're
directed
at.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
the
regulation,
yes.
therefore,
he
was
not
the
first
qualified
applicant.
so
you
see
the
lease
went
out
to
him
and
then
the
manager
in
the
local
land
office,
he
keeps
on
going
through
in
chronological
order.
and
what
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
it's
just
a
--
to
everyone's
advantage
to
get
it
done
and
get
on
with
it.
i
don't
--
also
our
brief
in
the
court
below
stressed
that
it
was
important
to
begin
getting
the
royalties.
i
find
that
a
little
hard
to
take
it
seriously,
98%
of
the
leases
are
beyond
question.
let's
get
on
with
the
show.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
now
you
see
it
goes
on
along
in
chronological
sequence
and
in
due
course,
he
came
to
cuccia
and
conley's
application.
it
was
filed
just
19
minutes
after
boesche's.
the
volume
of
business
was
that
you
can
get
to
it
for
seven
or
eight
weeks,
i
think.
but
then
he
got
cuccia
and
conley
and
he
saw
according
to
his
record
that
the
land
was
no
longer
available
because
it
had
been
granted
to
boesche.
this
is
all
down
in
the
local
office
desk.
so
he
notified
cuccia
and
conley
as
he
is
required
to
by
the
regulation
that
their
application
was
denied
because
the
land
had
been
leased,
he
has
to
state
this
under
the
regulation.
because
the
land
had
been
leased
on
an
application
number
such
and
such
filed
in
such
and
such
term.
now,
this
is
the
first
formal
opportunity
cuccia
and
conley
had
to
know
that
there
was
another
fellow
who
claimed
to
be
the
first
qualified
applicant.
they
may
have
known
it
by
gossip
earlier
but
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
machinery
which
would
enable
either
them
or
the
local
manager
to
know
before
he
came
to
that
application
that
there
were
other
competing
applications
for
this
land.
now,
the
draftsmen
of
the
departmental
regulation
envisage
this
in
fact
i
think
they
withdrawn
to
make
this
regular
part
of
the
appellate
procedure.
the
regulations
provide
that
when
an
application
is
denied,
as
happened
in
cuccia
and
conley,
you
have
an
opportunity
to
appear
within
30
days
and
when
you
take
the
appeal
you're
required
to
give
notice
to
the
prior
fellow,
boesche
who
got
the
application.
in
other
words,
it
is
at
this
higher
stage
to
the
bureau
of
land
management
that
this
becomes
in
its
nature
an
adversary
proceeding
and
someone
looked
for
the
first
time
to
determine
which
of
this
competing
applicant
really
is
entitled
to
this
land.
in
this
case,
it
appeared
that
it
was
cuccia
and
conley
that
had
the
prior
statutory
right
to
this
land.
if
boesche
had
had
evidence
that
he
wished
to
introduce
that
the
probation
and
the
regulation
for
requesting
a
hearing
is
evidenced,
the
regulations
are
discretionary
but
it
may
well
be
the
segment
of
the
opportunity
and
one
might
include
that
some
kind
of
a
hearing
would
be
required
in
such
a
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
simply
--
simply
time
and
cumbersomeness
extends
to
both
parties
and
of
course
we
would
be
very
greatly
concerned
about
any
such
decision
because
it
would
--
we
would
wonder
doesn't
it
affect
the
taylor
grazing
act?
doesn't
it
affect
various
other
kinds
of
entries
and
claims?
doesn't
it
throw
doubt
on
this
power
that
the
department
of
interior
has
exercised
for
a
century?
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
believe
--
either
i
didn't
understand
the
question
or
misspoke
myself
in
the
answer.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
in
that
event,
i
misled
the
chief
justice.
it
had
something
else
--
had
something
else
i
mind.
i
believe
i'm
right
in
saying
that
leases
under
the
taylor
grazing
act
are
cancelled
administratively
in
the
same
manner
as
these.
that
--
that's
a
direct
statement.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
not
like
this.
not
like
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
not
like
this,
mr.
justice
black.
no,
they're
not
like
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
first,
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
grants
the
power
to
cancel
for
fraud.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
does
--
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
wouldn't
think
that
the
statute
designed
that
as
a
reason,
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
not.
i
think
that
you
have
to
resort
to
some
general
power
in
the
background
outside
of
the
statute.
now,
as
i
suggested
to
justice
goldberg
either,
earlier
i
suppose
you
can
draw
it
in
by
saying
we
assume
that
congress
must
have
intended
it.
it
seems
to
me
cleaner
to
say
that
they
intended
to
put
it
down
in
an
existing
legal
framework
but
i
say
once
you
start
that
then
the
part
of
the
legal
framework
is
this
notion
that
the
department
of
interior
is
a
land
tribunal
as
well
as
simply
a
lessor.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
think
--
i
think
so
too.
i'm
simply
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
in
using
fraud
as
an
illustration
and
an
important
one,
perhaps
i've
misled
the
court
as
to
the
causes
of
cancellation.
fraud
is
statistically
a
very
minor
cause
of
cancellation.
most
of
the
causes
of
cancellation
go
to
mistakes
such
as
that
the
land
was
under
a
prior
lease,
that
it
was
part
of
an
indian
reservoir,
that
it
was
under
lands
that
have
been
patented,
that
it
was
--
should've
gone
under
a
competitive
lease
instead
of
noncompetitive
lease,
and
importantly,
to
the
prior
qualified
applicant.
because
remember
here,
mr.
justice
black,
this
is
not
just
a
quarrel
between
boesche
and
the
government.
there's
cuccia
and
conley
here.
there's
somebody
else's
statutory
right
was
taken
away
from
him
by
the
mistake
way
down
by
the
local
manager
in
the
land
office
and
he
as
fast
as
he
could
through
the
procedure
set
up
to
the
departmental
regulation
carried
this
up
to
the
boss,
the
secretary
of
interior
and
said,
“look
your
local
manager
has
denied
me
a
statutory
right
to
this
lease,”
and
when
the
secretary
discovered
that,
he
said
as
was
the
case
that's
where
it
comes
it
here,
“yes,
my
local
manager
denied
you
your
statutory
right.”
what's
he
going
to
do
with
that
point?
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
proper
thing
for
him
to
do
is
to
say,
“well,
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
i
have
to
correct
this
mistake.
i'm
going
to
give
boesche
back
his
money.
i'm
going
to
give
you
the
lease.
i
recognized
that
there's
been
some
inconvenience
or
possibly
more
but
certainly
some
inconvenience
because
of
the
mistake
that
my
fellow
made.
but
nevertheless,
i'm
going
to
correct
it
and
make
it
right
as
fast
as
i
have
found
about
it
under
the
established
departmental
procedure.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
justice
black,
if
this
were
--
if
this
were
mining
claims,
if
they
were
homestead
entries,
if
they
were
swamp
land
selection,
if
they
were
surveys
made
by
the
department,
all
these
determining
who
would
be
the
fellow
who
would
get
the
land
and
get
more
rights
to
this
exploration
for
a
century
they
have
been
determined
in
the
department
of
interior.
this
is
not
--
mr.
archibald
cox
a
new
power
that
we
are
saying.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
quite
true
that
in
those
cases
there
were
not
statutes
dealing
with
the
problem
of
cancellation.
i
was
simply
seeking
to
emphasize
that
this
is
not
a
noble
or
extraordinary
expansion
of
administrative
power
that
we're
arguing
before
you.
it's
a
very
familiar
type
of
power
that
whether
it
exist
in
this
case
requires
one
to
go
back
to
the
analysis
of
the
statute
that
i've
already
done,
we
think
the
court
below
was
right
on
that
point.
mr.
archibald
cox
unquestionable,
unquestionable.
there's
no
--
i
should
have
--
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
i
suppose
in
some
ways
you
might
almost
say
that
the
question
here
is
whose
going
to
be
the
one
to
take
it
to
court
that
sometimes
i
thought
it
almost
comes
down
to
that
except
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
well
a
lot
of
them
will
never
go
to
court
is
the
difference.
a
great
many
surely
will
never
go
to
court.
this
man
has
laid
out
a
$120
that
we're
fighting
over
(inaudible).
mr.
archibald
cox
your
honor's
qualification
about
the
difference
that
is
to
what
is
open
to
the
court
is
quite
right.
although
the
judicial
review,
as
i
read
the
cases,
does
seem
to
me
to
be
rather
considerable,
although
there's
some
limits
on
the
facts.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
am
told
--
i
asked
this
question
of
the
bureau
of
public
lands
and
i'm
told
that
this
problem
has
never
come
up.
the
reason,
as
it's
explained
to
me
justice
goldberg
is
that
these
leases
are
usually
small
expected
relief
and
that
for
the
first
period
of
any
lease,
i
am
told
that
what
usually
happens
is
the
man
who
gets
the
lease,
spends
his
time
running
around
trying
to
find
somebody
else
who
will
come
and
drill
on
the
land.
and
that
therefore,
would
be
the
unusual
case
in
which
any
cause
would
occur.
i
suppose
another
limiting
factor
is
that
it
certainly
must
be
the
unusual
case
where
you're
dealing
as
we
are
with
prior
competing
applicants.
that
the
question
isn't
raised
within
a
rather
short
time,
two
or
three
months,
here
it
is
two.
i
suppose
it
might
run
on
several,
i
don't
know.
now,
fraud
and
things
like
that
of
course
might
go
undiscovered
land.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
suppose
the
most
--
most
likely
a
source
of
suit
would
be
not
in
the
court
of
claims
but
i
should
think
under
the
court
of
claims
act.
but
i
don't
--
i
think
i
must
state
that
we
might
raise
the
argument
that
it
was
an
exercise
of
the
discretionary
function
by
the
local
land
office
manager.
i
don't
--
there
would
be
problems.
i
don't
think
there
are
any
clear
remedies.
i
say,
this
apparently
has
never
happened
at
least
so
i
am
informed.
thank
you.
