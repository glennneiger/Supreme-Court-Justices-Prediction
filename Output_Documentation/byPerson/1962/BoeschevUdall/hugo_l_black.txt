opinion.
justice

i
thought
you
said
speaking

justice

i
misunderstood
it.
justice

you
are
urging
that
he
has
to
go
into
the
court
to
try
that
case
itself.

whether
it
is
beyond

power?

where
is
the

was

area.
does
the
taylor
grazing
act,
which
provide
this
execution
so
far
as
the
grazing
act,
contain
provisions
like
this
preserved
expressly
giving
the
secretary
authority
and
power
to
cancel
on
such
a
lease?
justice

to
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
connection,
you're
time
is
up
but
i
just
--
you
said
several
times
that
the
secretary
has
a
right
to
cancel
for
fraud
despite
the
interrogation.
now,
what
is
the
advantage,
scope
of
the
advantages
for
the
public
and
so
forth
as
the
speed,
fraud
as
typically
as
judicial
question,
the
corresponding
effect
is
exceedingly
important
that
man
has
a
lease.
he
has
something
wholly.
they'd
be
very
valuable
or
frequently
maybe
sometimes
too
valuable
for
the
consideration
of
failing.
but
what
are
the
arguments
in
favor
of
failing
that
where
statute
authorizes
with
cancellation
by
fraud,
we
should
read
in
to
that
a
power
to
do
it
by
the
secretary
and
so
the
court.
i
frankly
find
it
hard
to
make
that
ballot
come
out
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
going
to
the
courts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
it
doesn't
but
i'll
say,
isn't
it
bold
enough
to
cover
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
would
suppose
that
without
statutory,
there
would
be
a
sort
of
power
to
go
into
the
court
and
the
tract
of
covenant
is
something
(voice
overlap)
for
fraud.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
i
find
it
is
hard
--
i
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
reach
a
conclusion
that
you
cannot
easily
find
that
that
shall
be
submitted
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
as
an
administrative
matter
to
determine
these
important
questions
that
go
to
the
root
of
the
controversy,
is
it
fraud?
who
finds
it?
what
happened
with
reference
to
those
findings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
treated
that
casually
with
reference
to
any
cancellation,
such
time
in
memorial
so
far
as
we're
concerned,
the
courts
have
tried
cases
like
these
that
had
been
reluctant
on
the
part
of
many
people
to
extend
that
trial,
extend
the
trial
to
try
controversy
just
like
that,
administrative
agency
because
it's
more
convenient
and
can
be
done
more
seriously.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
have
this
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
recall
in
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote,
why
then
there
was
no
act
such
as
this
has
come
in
and
prescribed
ways
for
the
secretary
to
cancel
which
whether
limited
or
not
limited,
certainly
required
him
to
go
to
the
court
and
cause
forfeit.
as
i
recall
it
that
question
was
not
in
mr.
justice
douglas'
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
more
difference,
isn't
it?
one
of
them
is
a
complicated
judicial
review,
very
complicated
in
many
instances.
why
you
almost
compel
to
accept
findings
and
they
were
investigated
judicially
and
it
may
get
bad
or
a
feeling
that
someone
may
have
about
not
going
too
far
and
substituted
an
executive
action
with
judicial
action.
