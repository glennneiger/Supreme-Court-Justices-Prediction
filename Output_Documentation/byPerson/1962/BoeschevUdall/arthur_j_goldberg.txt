(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
there
any
development
in
there?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
was
years
before
the
secretary
entered
his
final
decision,
you
mentioned
the
year
--
the
entire
period?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
would
you
say
this
thing
has
happened
before,
the
proceeding
has
been
brought
in
the
district
court
in
these
terms?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
paid
rent
on
it.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
paid
rent
on
it.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
you
wouldn't
object
to
that?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
i'm
looking
at
page
53
of
the
government's
brief
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
benezra,
would
you
describe
what
happened
when
the
agent
of
the
department
of
interior
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
benezra,
i
wonder
from
your
contention,
could
the
secretary
ever
cancel
a
lease
when
a
mineral
is
found
there
either
by
administrative
or
judicial
act?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
under
a
lease,
suppose
there's
a
lease.
suppose
this
portion
has
been
obtained
as
(inaudible)
go
to
the
secretary,
the
land
is
covering
a
valuable
deposit
of
oil
and
gas,
what
could
the
secretary
do
over
those?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
could
it
mean
that
it's
restricted
to
the
language
of
the
statute
in
a
situation
where
the
value
is
described?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
looking
at
the
statute,
after
that,
he
can
go
to
the
court,
lest
if
we
know
a
violation
of
the
terms
of
the
lease?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
on
what
statutory
language?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
this
power
also
exercised
in
additional
events
where
the
secretary
could
violate
the
statute?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
general
in
that
connection,
i
presume
exclusively
implying
to
what
statutory
scheme
that
fraud
is
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
can
i
ask
you
this
question?
is
they
tried
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
general,
it
is
very
unique
to
say
and
this
would
be
out
of
the
question.
what
is
the
main
practical
disadvantage
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
the
general
concern,
(inaudible)
in
most
similar
statute
that's
built
under
the
grazing
act.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
thought
your
answer
to
mr.
chief
justice
when
he
asked
you
whether
it's
comparable
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
general,
suppose
the
development
parts
of
the
--
in
terms
of
(inaudible)
were
those
are
business
models?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
instead,
would
there
be
an
action
in
the
court
of
claims
