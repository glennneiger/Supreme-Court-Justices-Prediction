justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
get
that
back?
do
you
get
that
--
supposing
you're
wrong
in
this
case,
do
you
get
that
back?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
not
--
are
you
arguing
your
cons
--
is
your
position
a
constitutional
one
or
statutory?
justice
john
m.
harlan
constitutional?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
due
process.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
got
section
31
first
of
all,
haven't
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course
title
hasn't
passed
in
this
case,
i
don't
know
if
it
makes
any
difference
under
the
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
the
secretary
promulgated
a
regulation
saying
that
henceforth
all
leases
were
to
be
made
conditionally
or
on
a
condition
subsequent
namely
that
they
would
have
been
cancelled
and
if
within
period
of
x
days,
the
department
found
that
the
lease
have
been
improperly
issued,
would
the
secretary
have
power
to
do
that
over
the
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
your
argument
--
you
have
to
assume
the
purpose
of
your
argument
because
of
our
limited
grant
of
certiorari
that
the
administrative
interpretation,
the
underlying
question
is
correct?
justice
john
m.
harlan
let's
take
a
more
extreme
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
position
would
be,
i
take
it,
that
if
it
is
prove
beyond
peradventure
that
the
lessee
who
walked
in
and
offer
to
bribe
to
an
underling
of
the
department
of
interior,
department
of
land
notwithstanding
that
the
government
wanted
to
cancel
that
lease
and
that
they
would
have
a
legal
right
to
it.
it
had
to
be
done
through
a
court
action.
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
am
saying.
justice
john
m.
harlan
were
those
--
any
of
those
contested,
mr.
solicitor
general?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
effect
do
you
give
to
the
first
part
of
section
31
then
which
is
always
been
in
the
statute,
as
i
understand
it,
that
certainly
covers
a
situation
where
the
lease
was
made
in
excess
of
authority
which
was
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
with
the
additive
language
as
you
call
it
was
--
that's
a
separate
provision.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
but
the
one
i
thought
to
which
you
regard
as
the
additive
language
is
what
appears
in
the
second
paragraph.
any
lease
issued
after
august
1935.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
43.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
assuming
your
position
is
accepted,
would
there
be
judicial
review
of
the
administrative
determination?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
where
i
answer
the
point
of
my
question.
what's
the
difference?
