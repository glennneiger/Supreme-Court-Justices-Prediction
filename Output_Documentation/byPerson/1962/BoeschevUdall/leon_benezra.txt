mr.
leon
benezra
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
authority
under
section
31
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
to
cancel
oil
and
gas
leases
by
administrative
action
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
department's
regulations.
the
facts
are
uncontroverted
in
this
case
and
briefly
stated,
they
are
as
follows:
on
september
11,
1956,
petitioner's
father,
n.w.c.
boesche,
now
deceased,
filed
application
for
an
oil
and
gas
lease
on
an
80-tract
--
80-acre
tract
of
public
land.
on
that
date
an
adjoining
40-acre
tract
was
already
under
application
for
lease,
previously
filed
by
one
thomas
connell.
also
on
september
11,
1856,
but
later
in
the
day,
vincent
cuccia
and
george
e.
conley
filed
a
joint
application
for
a
lease
on
both
the
40-acre
tract
previously
filed
by
connell
and
the
80-acre
tract
previously
filed
by
boesche.
subsequently,
the
manager
of
the
santa
fe
land
office
on
december
1,
1956
issued
a
lease
to
the
40-acre
parcel
to
connell.one
year
later,
on
december
1,
1957,
the
manager,
after
making
a
determination
that
boesche,
petitioner
herein,
was
the
first
qualified
applicant
for
the
80-acre
tract,
issued
a
lease
to
him.
and
later
on
january
24,
1958,
the
manager
rejected
the
cuccia
and
conley
application
for
a
lease
on
the
80
acres
already
issued
to
the
petitioner.
cuccia
and
conley
then
appealed
to
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
land
management.
and
on
january
9,
1959,
one
year
and
one
month
after
the
lease
had
been
issued
to
the
petitioner,
the
director
held
that
petitioner's
lease
should
be
cancelled
for
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
department's
640-acre
rule.
boesche,
the
petitioner,
then
appealed
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
on
august
5,
1959,
the
secretary,
through
his
deputy
solicitor,
affirmed
the
director's
decision
and
directed
cancellation
of
the
boesche
lease.
mr.
leon
benezra
my
client
has
done
nothing
with
the
lease
obviously,
because
it's
in
jeopardy.
but
--
mr.
leon
benezra
whatever
development
there
could
be
has
been
halted
by
the
secretary's
administrative
cancellation
or
rather
attempted
administrative
cancellation
of
the
lease
because
as
soon
as
the
secretary
hands
down
his
decision,
our
client
moved
to
the
district
court
in
an
action
to
prevent
the
secretary
to
cancel.
mr.
leon
benezra
yes.
during
this
entire
period,
because
of
the
so-called,
“appellate
review,”
of
the
department,
knowing
full
well
that
there
was
a
review
procedure
and
the
fact
that
the
conflicting
applicant,
cuccia
and
conley
had
filed
an
appeal.
my
client
was
unable
to
do
anything
with
the
lease
during
this
period,
although
he
supposedly
had
a
lease
for
a
five-year
term,
and
so
long
thereafter,
this
oil
and
gas
was
produced.
mr.
leon
benezra
in
the
district
court,
where
the
land
is
located?
not
quite,
your
honor,
in
this
respect.
at
least
the
lessor
would
not
have
been
immediately
involved
in
this
situation.
in
effect,
there
is
a
double
jeopardy.
there
is
the
appellate
review
jeopardy
in
the
administrative
procedure
and
then
of
course
there
would
be
one
in
a
court.
but
during
all
this
period,
since
the
secretary
of
the
interior
issues
a
lease
and
upon
issuance
of
the
lease,
the
primary
term
for
five-year
commences,
you
have
a
double
period
where
the
lessee
can
do
nothing
with
the
lease,
although
he
has
been
given
under
the
lease
and
under
the
statute
the
exclusive
right
to
go
on
the
land,
to
produce
and
develop.
mr.
leon
benezra
pardon
me?
mr.
leon
benezra
yes.
during
this
period,
we
had
to
pay
rent.
and
on
this
score,
i
might
say
--
mr.
leon
benezra
if
we're
wrong
in
the
case,
i
think
we
do
get
the
rent
back.
but
let
me
say
this,
the
secretary
has
pointed
out
in
his
brief
that
perhaps
it
might
be
better
not
to
issue
a
lease
until
the
conflicting
applications
right
of
review
has
been
--
has
gone
through
the
administrative
procedure.
but
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
while
we
wait
the
relevant
considerations
and
now
we've
decided
we'll
issue
the
lease
first
and
then
take
up
the
appellate
procedure.
but
if
my
client's
lease
had
been
sustained,
your
honor,
in
answer
to
your
question,
he
would
have
lost
one
year,
eight
months,
and
five
days
of
his
lease
period.
and
during
that
entire
time,
he
would
have
had
to
pay
the
rental
and
the
rental
would
not
have
been
turned
in.
and
actually
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
the
reason
why
--
and
the
secretary
delicately
refrains
from
stating
the
real
reason,
the
real
reason
why
they
issued
the
leases
first
and
then
take
up
the
appellate
procedure,
is
so
that
they
can
collect
the
rent
as
soon
as
the
lease
is
issued.
but
the
secretary
points
out
in
justification
of
that
that
really,
you
know,
in
most
cases
the
lease
is
sustained.
but
then
in
most
cases,
mind
you,
and
even
if
my
client's
lease
had
been
sustained
by
the
secretary,
during
that
period,
the
lease
--
primary
term
of
the
lease
would
apply
and
he
would
have
had
to
pay
rental
for
a
period
in
which
he
had
no
use
whatever
of
the
land.
now,
section
17
of
the
act
says
that
the
lessee
shall
have
a
five-year
term.
it
says
nothing
about
a
three-year
term
or
a
three-and-a-half-year
term
or
a
three
years,
eight
months
term.
but
in
effect,
this
is
what
the
secretary
has
done.
it
says
he
collects
the
lease
rental
and
the
term
begins.
and
every
instance
where
the
lease
is
sustained,
the
lessee's
lease
is
curtailed,
whether
it
would
be
for
a
year,
a
year-and-a-half
or
two
years.
mr.
leon
benezra
not
at
all,
your
honor.
but
we
do
object
--
we
do
object
issuing
a
lease
and
then
telling
the
man,
“we'll
take
your
rental
but
we're
not
going
to
permit
you
to
go
on
the
land
to
develop
that
lease.”
and
i
might
say,
your
honor,
your
honors,
in
this
connection,
i
have
the
lease
here.
i
think
it's
very
interesting
because
item
six
of
the
lease
issued
to
boesche
says,
“offeror's
signature
to
this
office
shall
also
constitute
offeror's
signature
to
an
acceptance
of
this
lease.”
the
offeror
further
agrees
that
this
offer
cannot
be
withdrawn
in
whole
or
in
part
unless
the
withdrawal
is
received
by
the
land
office
before
this
lease
has
been
signed
in
behalf
of
the
united
states.
they
tell
a
man,
“once
you
sign
the
lease
and
one
--
once
the
government
has
signed
the
lease,
you
can't
withdraw
it,”
this
is
a
contract.
but
this
doesn't
prevent
the
government
from
immediately
moving
to
cancel
a
lease.
in
other
words,
it's
a
unilateral
proposition.
the
government
is
bound
by
one
set
of
rules
and
petitioner
is
bound
by
another
set
of
rules.
and
i
submit
that
this
is
contrary
to
our
entire
anglo-saxon
concept
of
contractual
relations
and
this,
this
court
has
long
held
in
the
sinking-fund
cases
that
with
respect
to
contractual
matters,
the
government
is
as
much
bound
by
contracts
as
individuals.
mr.
leon
benezra
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
benezra
yes.
i
think
--
oh,
you
mean
the
due
process
proposition?
mr.
leon
benezra
i
think
so.
i
mean,
a
right
has
been
given,
a
contractual
right
has
been
established
with
the
petitioner.
and
that
cannot
be
divested
without
court
ruling,
especially
since
the
other
party
is
the
one
that's
acting
as
the
judge
in
this
case.
mr.
leon
benezra
yes,
and
if
i
may
proceed
in
this
connection,
your
honor.
it
is
petitioner's
contention
that
section
31,
that
under
section
31,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
no
authority
to
cancel
a
lease
administratively
and
i
think
here
it
might
be
well
to
read
what
the
section
says.
the
text
of
section
31
has
originally
enacted
in
february
25,
1920.
it
provides
acceptance
to
hear
as
otherwise
herein
provided
any
lease
issued
under
the
provisions
of
this
act
may
be
forfeited
and
cancelled
by
an
appropriate
proceeding
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
in
which
the
property
or
some
thought
thereof
is
located
whenever
the
lessee
fails
to
comply
with
any
of
the
provisions
of
this
act
or
the
lease,
or
the
general
regulations
promul
--
promulgated
under
this
act.
now,
thus
in
its
original
form,
section
31
expressly
provides
that
judicial
proceedings
shall
govern
the
cancellation
of
leases
for
any
violation
of
the
departmental
regulations.
and
this
was
the
understanding
of
the
secretary
himself
in
1930,
for
in
1930
in
the
case
of
melish
consolidated
placer
oil
mining
company
versus
testerman,
the
secretary
said
in
no
uncertain
terms
quotes,
“the
lease
once
granted
was
beyond
recall
by
the
secretary
and
is
only
subject
to
cancellation
in
the
federal
courts,”
and
he
cites
section
31
of
the
act
of
february
25,
1920.
but
i
want
to
go
on
to
say
that
in
1935,
the
congress
did
give
the
secretary
of
the
interior
expressed
authority
to
cancel
leases
upon
the
failure
of
lessee
to
comply
with
any
of
the
provisions
of
this
lease.
and
again,
in
1946,
the
same
provision
was
added
to
section
31
at
the
end
thereof
and
reads
as
follows:
"any
lease
issued
after
august
21,
1935,
under
the
provisions
of
section
17
of
the
act
shall
be
subject
to
cancellation
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
after
30
days
notice
upon
the
failure
of
the
lessee
to
comply
with
any
of
the
provisions
of
the
lease
unless
or
until
the
land
covered
by
any
such
lease
is
known
to
contain
valuable
deposits
of
oil
or
gas."
there
was
no
violation
by
petitioner
of
any
of
the
lease
provisions
and
this
is
the
only
basis
upon
which
the
secretary
can
cancel
a
lease
under
the
provisions
of
this
act.
now,
in
his
brief,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
asserts
that
he
has
the
administrative
power
to
cancel
a
lease
independently
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
and
notwithstanding
any
of
its
expressed
provisions.
and
the
secretary
implies
this
authority
from
section
441
of
the
revised
statutes
of
1875,
in
which
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
given
the
job
of
supervising
the
public
business
relating
to
the
public
lands
including
mines.
now,
the
question
before
this
court
comes
therefore
in
this
setting.congress,
by
1935
amendment
of
the
act
and
the
later
1946
amendment
of
section
31
of
the
act
expressly
provided
that
the
secretary
may
administratively
cancel
leases
where
there
has
been
a
violation
by
the
lessee
of
the
terms
of
the
lease.
otherwise,
section
31
of
the
act
remains
in
its
original
form
that
the
cancellation
of
an
oil
and
gas
lease
is
to
be
accomplished
by
judicial
proceedings
and
not
only
just
judicial
proceedings.
judicial
proceedings
in
an
action
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
where
the
land
or
any
part
thereof
is
located.
thus,
we
have
a
situation
that
the
secretary
has
been
given
expressed
powers
with
respect
to
the
cancellation
of
leases
but
it
is
a
limited
one.
it
is
limited
to
a
specific
situation
and
that
situation
is
where
the
lessee
himself
has
violated
the
terms
of
the
lease.
and
this
means
in
effect
that
the
lessee
has
violated
the
contract
and
therefore
since
the
lessee
himself
has
violated
the
contract,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
can
move
in
and
exercise
his
right
to
invalidate
the
contract
since
there
has
a
violation
by
the
lessee.
if
the
secretary
has
the
power
to
cancel
a
lease,
apart
from
the
provisions
of
the
mineral
leasing
act,
the
1935
amendment,
the
1946
amendment,
the
terms
of
section
31
in
its
original
form
is
totally
superfluous.
it
is
rendered
absolutely
meaningless.
moreover,
we
should
know
that
section
37
of
the
act
reads
that
the
deposits
of
coal,
phosphate,
sodium,
oil,
oil
shale,
and
gas
shall
be
subject
to
disposition
only
in
the
form
and
manner
provided
in
this
act.
and
yet
the
secretary
of
the
interior
notwithstanding
this
mandatory
language
of
the
act
seeks
to
invoke
an
authority
totally
apart
from,
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
mineral
leasing
act.
mr.
leon
benezra
well,
historically,
the
secretary
in
his
reply
--
in
his
brief
had
an
appendix
b
and
c
in
which
he
cites
a
number
of
published
and
unpublished
decisions
and
if
you
will
--
although
he
claims,
although
the
secretary
claims
that
his
construction
of
the
act
of
authority
to
cancel
the
lease
stems
right
from
the
beginning
of
the
act.
this
is
not
actually
so.
first
of
all,
we
have
this
melish
decision
that
i
have
cited,
where
in
1930
the
secretary
stated
very
expressly
in
and
in
no
uncertain
terms
we
have
no
authority
to
administrative
cancel
--
administratively
cancel
the
lease.
and
up
to
1938,
the
only
cancellation
has
been
for
a
permit.
but
if
we
refer
to
section
26
of
the
mineral
leasing
act,
we
will
see
that
under
section
26,
the
secretary
was
given
expressed
authority
to
cancel
permits.
so
he
can
hardly
claim
his
cancellation
of
permits
up
to
1938
as
any
of
statutory
authority
for
cancelling
leases.
moreover,
if
the
secretary
had
--
congress
had
intended
to
give
the
secretary
authority
to
cancel
leases,
they
would
have
expressly
provided
just
as
they
expressly
provided
that
the
secretary
could
cancel
permits.
mr.
leon
benezra
for
--
to
go
and
prospect
for
oil
and
gas.
there
were
two
distinct
forms.
one
was
a
permit
and
one
was
a
lease.
and
these
were
the
two
vehicles
that
were
set
up
by
the
congress
for
the
development
of
the
oil
and
gas
on
the
public
domain.
but
congress
intended
to
expressly
provide
for
the
administration
of
this
act
and
how
these
things
could
be
cancelled.
and
with
respect
to
section
26,
they
said
the
secretary
has
authority
to
cancel
permits.
now,
the
earliest
cancellation
of
a
lease,
if
you
will
refer
to
the
appendix
is
in
1938
and
curiously
enough
it's
the
same
person,
boesche.
historically,
this
is
the
first
cancellation
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
of
a
lease.
and
curiously
enough,
it
was
not
passed,
it
was
canceled
solely
because
the
secretary
had
no
right
and
the
government
had
no
title
within
the
land.
and
after
that,
the
earliest
cancellation
was
in
1947.
but
i
want
to
go
on
to
say
that
the
implication
by
the
secretary
of
implied
authority
to
cancel
leases
by
the
section
441
of
the
1875
revised
statutes
cannot
be
sustained
in
view
of
this
court's
holding
in
youngstown
versus
sawyer.
in
youngstown
versus
sawyer,
this
court
established
the
principle
that
although
the
executive
may
imply
a
general
authority
in
cases
where
there
had
been
no
specific
provisions
set
forth
by
the
congress
with
respect
to
proceedings
to
be
--
to
be
followed.
once
the
congress
has
specified
a
cause
of
action
and
in
this
case
they
said
it
shall
be
done
by
judicial
proceedings,
the
executive
cannot
ignore,
cannot
ignore
the
expressed
provisions
of
the
statute.
mr.
leon
benezra
yes.
there
was
only
one
cancellation
after
1938
and
the
earliest
one
was
in
1947.
mr.
leon
benezra
what
were
they
made
for?
mr.
leon
benezra
in
--
in
most
cases,
in
the
earliest
cases
i
believe
is
just
a
question
that
the
government
had
to
title
to
the
land
at
the
time.
mr.
leon
benezra
no,
had
no
title
to
the
--
to
the
--
to
the
minerals.
that
was
done
in
1938,
in
boesche
case
and
the
earliest
one
after
that
was
in
1947.
i
think,
your
honors
that
--
mr.
leon
benezra
that
maybe
--
i
think
in
this
connection
that
the
crux
of
the
matter
is
this.
we
have
here
the
basic
question,
not
of
just
on
oil
and
gas
lease
and
the
question
of
a
right,
a
copyright
that
has
been
vested
in
the
individual.
we
have
here
basically
the
question
of
the
constitutional
division
of
authority
between
the
executive
and
congress.
and
in
this
connection,
i
think
the
statement
made
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
speaking
for
the
court
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
youngstown
versus
sawyer
is
applicable
and
applicable
here.
in
that
case,
justice
frankfurter
says,
“in
any
event
nothing
can
be
plainer
that
the
congress
made
a
conscious
choice
of
policy
in
a
field
full
of
perplexity
and
peculiarly
within
legislative
responsibility
for
choice.”
it
is
one
thing
to
draw
an
intention
of
congress
from
general
language
and
to
say
that
congress
would
have
explicitly
written
what
is
inferred
where
congress
has
not
addressed
itself
to
a
specific
situation.
it
is
quite
impossible,
however,
when
congress
did
specifically
address
itself
to
a
problem
as
it
did
in
this
case
to
find
secreted
and
the
antithesis
of
legislation,
the
very
grant
of
power
which
congress
consciously
withheld.
to
find
authority
so
explicitly
withheld
is
not
merely
to
disregard
in
a
particular
instance
the
clear
will
of
congress.
it
is
to
disrespect
the
whole
legislative
process
and
the
constitutional
division
of
authority
between
the
executive
and
congress.
mr.
leon
benezra
i'm
sorry?
mr.
leon
benezra
i
was
reading
from
frankfurter's
concurring
opinion
in
the
youngstown
versus
sawyer.
mr.
leon
benezra
pardon
me?
mr.
leon
benezra
i
said
in
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
leon
benezra
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
johnson
versus
towsley
and
west
versus
standard
oil
company,
established
a
clear
cut
line
of
demarcation
between
the
powers
of
the
executive
branch
on
the
one
hand
and
those
of
the
judicial
branch
on
the
other
hand
with
respect
to
cancelation
and
forfeiture
of
patents
and
like
instruments.
and
in
these
cases,
the
patent
cases,
the
court
recognized
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
had
wide
discretion
to
administer
the
public
lands
and
to
take
all
action
that
was
absolutely
necessary
up
to
the
time
that
patent
issue
and
legal
title
passed.
and
once
patent
issue
and
legal
title
passed,
the
patent
cases
have
established
the
principle
that
thereafter,
it
is
necessary
for
the
secretary
of
the
interior
or
the
conflicting
applicant
who
may
be
agreed
to
go
into
a
court
--
mr.
leon
benezra
yes.
title
has
passed
to
the
leaseholder.
mr.
leon
benezra
the
manager
issued
a
least
for
a
five-year
term
and
gave
the
lessee
an
exclusive
right
for
the
full
enjoyment
of
this
property.
and
i
might
say
that
the
lease
has
not
as
yet
been
cancelled.
it
has
been
held
for
cancellation
but
we
still
have
this
lease
and
that's
what
we're
fighting
about.
mr.
leon
benezra
yes,
this
is
--
yes,
he's
fully
aware
of
this
and
i
might
say,
your
honors,
i
dealt
with
this
matter
in
our
reply
brief.
and
this
is
what
the
secretary
says
about
this
procedure.
it
can
of
course
be
disputed
whether
the
ideal
practice
might
not
be
to
withhold
issuance
of
the
lease
until
final
disposition
of
any
appeals.
but
in
any
event,
it
is
peculiarly
a
question
of
internal
procedure
to
be
resolved
by
the
secretary.
they
justify
this
by
saying
that
the
likelihood
that
a
sub
--
subsequent
applicant
will
be
able
successfully
to
challenge
the
prior
application
is
not
deemed
sufficiently
substantial
to
warrant
postponement
of
the
issuance
of
a
lease.
but
the
secretary
said
in
the
court
below
that
the
principal
reason
why
they
issued
these
leases
is
so
that
they
can
get
the
rentals
immediately
and
therefore
what
happens
even
if
the
lease
is
sustained,
although
the
party
who
has
received
the
lease
has
been
denied
the
use
of
this
leasehold,
he
has
to
pay
for
the
full
five-year
term.
mr.
leon
benezra
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
this
matter
was
taken
into
account
in
brown
versus
hitchcock
and
in
that
case,
the
supreme
court
had
before
it
the
question
of
a
patent
that
have
been
issued
by
the
department
of
the
interior.
under
the
law,
patents
were
not
supposed
to
be
issue
--
issued
conveying
mineral
rights
in
the
event
that
the
land
is
known
to
be
mineral.
in
this
case,
they
couldn't
quite
make
up
their
mind
whether
it
was
agricultural
or
mineral.
so
they
wrote
into
patent
that
if
it's
agricultural,
you
have
the
patent
--
you
have
the
title
but
if
it
turns
out
to
be
mineral,
you
don't
have.
and
this
is
what
the
court
said
and
i
think
it's
applicable
here.
it
says
that
the
only
thing
that
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
do
is
to
issue
a
patent
and
no
uncertain
patents
are
permitted.
you
make
the
determination
before
do
you
issue
the
patent
as
whether
it's
mineral
or
it's
not
mineral.
and
in
this
case,
the
manager
made
a
determination
that
the
lessee
was
the
first
qualified
applicant.
if
you're
not
ready
to
make
a
determination
and
fulfill
your
executive
function
of
making
a
determination
prior
to
issuance
of
a
lease
or
a
patent,
just
don't
issue
the
lease
or
patent
until
you
make
up
your
mind.
and
there's
nothing
to
prevent
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
especially
since
they
know
that
there
is
a
conflicting
applicant,
nothing
to
prevent
him
from
deferring
the
issuance
of
the
lease
until
the
appellant
procedure
is
followed
through
in
the
department.
the
only
thing
that's
--
that
the
government
doesn't
like
about
this
it
doesn't
collect
the
money
right
away.
but
i
think
it
may
be
morally
questionable
to
say
to
a
man,
“look,
we'll
issue
a
lease
but
this
is
just
tentative
and
all
you
have
is
a
precarious
type.
but
meanwhile
you
pay
your
rent.”
now,
the
act
says
nothing
about
tentative
leases,
the
act
says
nothing
about
precarious
leases.
the
act
says
under
section
17
that
a
lease
shall
be
issued
for
a
primary
term
of
five
years
and
so
long
they're
after
as
oil
and
gas
is
produced
in
paying
funds.
mr.
leon
benezra
is
this
under
a
patent
situation?
mr.
leon
benezra
the
statute
clearly
says
that
the
secretary
may
cancel
the
lease
only
for
violation
for
a
lease
terms
and
even
with
respect
to
this
expressed
authority
to
cancel
leases
it's
limited
because
if
the
land
is
valuable
for
oil
and
gas,
he
has
to
go
into
a
court.
mr.
leon
benezra
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
--
the
statute
itself
permits
the
secretary
to
cancel
leases
only
in
the
event
that
it
is
not
valuable
for
oil
and
gas.
if
there
hasn't
been
discovered
in
paying
quantities,
after
that
he
has
to
go
into
court.
mr.
leon
benezra
i
think
he
can,
yes.
mr.
leon
benezra
under
the
--
on
the
--
under
the
section
31
of
the
original
statute.
because
if
there
is
--
if
--
if
it
says
under
the
original
line
of
statute
under
section
31
that
if
there
is
a
violation
of
the
statute
or
the
regulations,
the
secretary
may
proceed
in
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
leon
benezra
there
again,
there
again.
just
as
in
the
patent
of
cases,
in
the
patent
cases
there
were
thoughts.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
then
could
move
in
the
courts
in
the
patent
cases
and
this
is
what
section
31
provides.
mr.
leon
benezra
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
benezra
well,
i
believe
that
it's
--
it's
permissible.
if
the
secretary
finds
that
there
is
fraud
which
pre-exist
--
pre-exist
to
the
issuance
of
the
lease,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
authority
under
section
31
to
go
into
a
court
to
invalidate
the
lease.
mr.
leon
benezra
pardon
me?
mr.
leon
benezra
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
benezra
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
leon
benezra
no.
as
soon
as
the
lease
is
issued,
the
rental
begins.
mr.
leon
benezra
what
is
it?
50
cents
an
acre.
mr.
leon
benezra
that's
right.
mr.
leon
benezra
no,
annual
rentals
every
year.
mr.
leon
benezra
no.
mr.
leon
benezra
this
is
--
this
is
part
of
my
objection.
my
objection
is
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
under
section
31
has
no
authority
to
cancel
a
lease.
but
even
then
when
he
does
cancel,
money
goes
to
this
appellate
procedure
even
if
the
lease
is
sustained,
the
party
whose
lease
is
sustained
is
his
lease
period
is
curtailed.
mr.
leon
benezra
except
that
there
is
a
double
aspect
of
it.
you
have
both
the
department
and
the
judicial
proceedings.
mr.
leon
benezra
yes.
mr.
leon
benezra
that
--
you're
right.
mr.
leon
benezra
i
cannot
--
i
cannot
deny
that
but
here
the
lessor
himself
sets
up
a
situation
like
that
in
every
instance.
mr.
leon
benezra
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
benezra
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
benezra
well,
all
we're
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
the
statute
provides
for
judicial
proceedings
in
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
leon
benezra
i
would
assume,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
provision
in
section
31
which
says
whenever
the
lessee
fails
to
comply
with
any
of
the
provisions
of
this
act.
now,
you
may
have
a
broad
situation
as
we
had
in
the
pan
american
case.
certainly,
a
broad
situation
occurs
not
after
the
lease
is
issued
but
before
the
lease
is
issued.
and
therefore
someone
of
them
comes
to
the
department
and
fraudulently
claims
that
he's
a
qualified
person,
this
is
a
situation
that
amputates
the
issuance
of
the
lease
and
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
if
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
provisions
of
the
act,
the
procedure
shall
need
to
go
to
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
leon
benezra
that
--
that
is
true,
your
honor
in
this
respect.
in
any
administration
of
any
--
any
governmental
function
whether
it
would
be
a
matter
of
a
contract,
where
government
is
so
tremendously
large,
there
has
to
be
a
delegation
before
it.
the
war
department
delegates
authority
for
a
contracting
officer
to
enter
into
a
contract.
and
what
you
have
is
a
situation
here
that
the
manager
has
been
invested
with
the
secretary's
authority
and
it's
just
the
same
as
though
the
secretary
himself
issued
the
lease.
he
signs
in
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
it
is
assumed
and
it
is
correct
that
prior
to
the
time
that
the
lease
is
issued,
the
manager
is
supposed
to
examine
the
qualifications,
it's
suppose
to
apply
the
departmental
regulations.
and
he
makes
a
determination
as
he
did
in
this
case
the
petitioner
was
the
first
qualified
applicant.
and
once
that
determination
is
made,
he
has
fulfilled
his
functions,
he
has
issued
a
lease
but
which
--
mr.
leon
benezra
what
we
have
in
question
here
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
regulation.
and
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
it
is
possible
to
construe
this
regulation
in
the
way
the
petitioner
construed
the
regulation.
yes
sir?
mr.
leon
benezra
that
is
right
because
the
petition
limits
it
and
i
want
to
--
i
want
to
say
that
i
regret
getting
into
this
question.
i
had
not
intended
but
mr.
chief
justice's
discussion
led
me
into
it.
i
just
want
to
say
this,
i
want
to
emphasize,
somewhere
along
the
line
when
you
deal
with
the
government,
an
employee
of
the
government
has
to
be
in
a
position
to
make
a
determination.
this
is
so
not
only
in
the
government
but
so
in
the
business
as
well.
the
top
man
can't
make
every
determination
and
if
you
invest
a
man
with
authority
to
enter
in
the
contact
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
it
says
here,
you
know
the
petitioner
couldn't
withdraw
from
this
contract
during
the
first
year,
he
was
stuck
with
the
rental.
it
says
right
here
and
if
the
petitioner
is
going
to
be
bound,
why
shouldn't
the
government
be
bound?
the
time
for
the
man
to
make
his
mind
up
is
before
he
issues
the
lease.
and
this
is
the
only
way
you
can
carry
on
business
because
someone
above
disagrees
with
the
manager.
there's
no
reason
why
a
contract
with
the
united
states
government
shouldn't
be
worth
the
patent
--
mr.
leon
benezra
yes.
mr.
leon
benezra
i
think
--
mr.
leon
benezra
no,
i
would
still
say,
i
would
still
say
although
it
sounds
terrible.
i
would
still
say
that
the
secretary
has
to
go
into
a
court.
mr.
leon
benezra
yes.
yes,
because
this
is
the
only
place
that
you
can
have
an
evidentiary
hearing.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
appellate
procedure
provided
by
the
secretary
of
interior,
counsel
doesn't
even
make
an
oral
argument.
he
may
--
he
may
petition
the
secretary
to
make
an
oral
argument
on
appeal
but
this
--
the
times
when
a
lawyer
for
a
petitioner
is
permitted
to
make
an
oral
argument
to
the
appellate
procedure
are
very
rare
and
not
an
imperative
one.
mr.
leon
benezra
yes.
mr.
leon
benezra
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
benezra
i
would
say
--
mr.
leon
benezra
yes.
mr.
leon
benezra
i
--
i
--
mr.
leon
benezra
forgive
me.
i
understood,
your
honor,
to
say
that
it
is
beyond
his
power
to
issue.
if
he
said
beyond
his
power
to
cancel
--
mr.
leon
benezra
that's
right.
mr.
leon
benezra
that's
right.
mr.
leon
benezra
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
leon
benezra
if
he
in
fact
has
issued
a
lease
that
was
beyond
his
power
to
issue,
let
him
go
into
court
and
assert
that.
that's
my
position.
mr.
leon
benezra
that's
right.
mr.
leon
benezra
that's
right,
your
honor.
this
is
what
the
statute
plainly
states.
mr.
leon
benezra
yes.
mr.
leon
benezra
if
i
--
i
would
say
that
the
person
who
has
aggrieved
and
the
patent
case
has
point
this
out
and
brown
versus
hitchcock
states
very
plainly,
johnson
versus
towsley
states
very
plainly,
the
person
aggrieved
can
go
into
a
court
and
in
an
equity
procedure,
ask
the
court
to
have
the
--
and
impress
a
trust
on
the
person
who
has
received
the
lease
in
derogation
of
his
prior
rights.
mr.
leon
benezra
that's
right.
mr.
leon
benezra
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
benezra
the
same
problem
came
up
in
the
patent
cases
and
there
were
certainly
as
many
patents
issued
as
there
are
leases
issued
today.
and
this
court
said,
very,
very
plainly
in
these
cases
for
what
we
do
affirm
and
reiterate,
i'm
quoting
from
brown
versus
hitchcock
,173
