(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
what
were
the
terms
of
this
lease?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
were
the
terms
of
your
--
of
the
federal
lease,
did
you
pay
so
much
in
a
year
as
the
outset
of
the
lease?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
delay
rentals
--
justice
byron
r.
white
delay
rentals
or
not
under
the
lease?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
is
the
rental?
that's
what
i'm
asking.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
for
the
outset?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
you
have
to
pay.
no
delay
rentals
each
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
on
--
is
your
only
real
objection
that
the
rent
started
on
this
lease?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
really
had
cut
down
to
three
years
or
two
years
or
something
in
that
sense.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
same
is
true
if
he
doesn't
by
judicial
proceeding
under
31.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
even
if
--
accepting
your
position
that
he
has
no
power
administrated
to
cancel
the
lease,
the
secretary
would
be
moved
in
court.
you
would
--
the
lease
would
be
subsequent
to
the
same
hazard
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
you
would
still
could
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
rent
back
than
where
if
you
have
a
stay.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
notice
of
the
--
you
have
notice
of
the
appeal
of
conley
and
this
other
fellow
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
he
participated
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
you
object
to
the
secretary's
jurisdictions
beforehand?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
made
that
point
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
benezra
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we
do
--
i
think
we
do
have
to
consider
this
case
on
the
assumption
or
it
gets
to
--
or
against
the
idea
that
this
lease
really
was
beyond
the
power
of
the
secretary
to
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
rule
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
is
simply
--
you've
just
observed
that
you
would
--
i
thought
you
would
apply
this
rule
right
across
the
board
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
once
the
lease
is
issued,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
beyond
his
power
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
must
go
into
court
to
cancel.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
it's
beyond
his
power
to
issue
a
valid
lease
on
the
--
in
these
circumstances.
let's
assume
that
it
was.
you
would
still
apply
your
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
must
be
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
this
case
the
issue
would
be
whether
this
lease
was
issued
beyond
--
that
this
was
a
lease
that
was
beyond
the
power
of
the
secretary
to
issue.
that
would
be
under
the
act
and
under
his
regulations.
that
is
the
issue
as
you
are
providing.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
court
proceeding
or
before
him,
before
the
secretary.
justice
