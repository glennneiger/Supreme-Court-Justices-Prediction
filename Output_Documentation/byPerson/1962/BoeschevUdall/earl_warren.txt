secretary

mr.
benezra.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
did
the
secretary
of
the
interior
first
changed
his
view
concerning
the
--
his
rights
in
this
regard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
permits
for
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
reasons
were
those
earlier
cancellations
made,
cancellation
of
leases,
the
38
and
the
47
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
were
those
made
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
what
were
the
reasons
to
sign
for
mineral
and
oil
leases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
government
had
no
title?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
benezra,
i
was
wondering
if
section
31
is
all
inclusive
and
it
provides
the
only
means
for
cancelling
a
lease
and
not
being
through
court
action.
how
can
you
read
into
it
that
it
also
provides
for
cancelling
a
lease
for
what
happens
before
the
lease
is
issued?
if
you
can
read
that
into
the
act,
why
can't
the
solicitor
general
also
read
into
the
act
what
he
dissolves
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
the
--
the
solicitor
general
as
i
understand
it
here,
does
contend
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
act,
not
on
your
part
but
on
the
part
of
the
government
because
a
lease
of
this
kind
could
not
be
issued
to
you
because
you
did
not
claim
--
you
did
not
seek
to
lease
also
the
adjoining
land
it
being
under
640
acres.
chief
justice
earl
warren
regardless
--
regardless
of
whether
he's
authorized
under
the
act
to
do
so
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
there
were
two,
two
people
applying
for
the
lease
and
it
was
first
given
to
one
and
he
went
into
possession
and
was
producing
and
later
through
some
administrative
error,
the
lease
was
given
to
the
second
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
have
a
right
to
go
into
court
to
have
that
decided
or
would
the
--
or
would
the
secretary
of
the
interior
have
the
right
to
cancel
that
second
lease?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
would
think
even
under
those
circumstances
you
would
have
no
right
to
cancel
your
second
lease.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
that's
all
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all
i
was
asking.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
what
you
read
us
a
moment
ago?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
you
read
from
brown
versus
hitchcock
awhile
ago.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
what
period
--
in
what
period
of
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
three-year
period.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
general,
you
mentioned
leases
under
the
taylor
grazing
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
other
--
other
kinds
of
leases
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
specific
statute
that
gives
the
right
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
do
this
under
the
taylor
grazing
act
or
--?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
is
that,
that's
done
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
done
on
the
same
principle
or
theories
that
you're
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
asserting
in.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
as
the
counsel
said
that
it's
late
as
1930
and
never
before
the
secretary
of
the
interior
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
the
only
power
that
he
had
was
through
the
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
your
own
time
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
i
like
to
--
i'd
like
to
have
you
get
to
the
practicalities
of
it
for
just
a,
just
a
minute
and
--
and
the
way
you
acquire
the
interpretation
of
the
taylor
grazing
act
and
these
other
--
these
other
acts
that
backbones
--
