excuse
me,
could
you
tell
me
what
difference
it
will
make
to
your
clients
over
the
long
run
which
accounting
whether
they
have
to
report
these
sums

in
over
the
years?
justice
byron

how
does
that
make
this
much
difference
as
to
whether
you
report
the
income
this
year
and
next
year?
justice
byron

and
you
have
an

and
when
a
student
cancels
out
there
is
no
adjustment
to

there
would
be
no
way
of
adjusting
to
get
back
the
money
you
paid
in
taxes
in
the
first
year?
justice
byron

thank
you.
justice

yes.
justice

yes,
sir.
justice

yes.
justice
byron

yes,
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
--
oh,
i
misunderstood
you.
the
concessions
--
concession
would
mean
very,
very
little
to
us
as
far
as
money
is
concerned,
sir.
surprising
as
it
seems
because
there
--
a
substantial
amount
had
been
paid
on
the
contracts
in
advance.
justice
byron

(inaudible)
justice

but
if
it
say

but
if
he
makes
the
payment
on
an
installment
note
which
has
been
transferred
in
banks,
that's
already
been

that's
already
been

and
even
though
the
bank,
even
though
he
does

the
studio
does
not
get
face
value
from
the
note?
justice
byron

(inaudible)
justice

and
what
difference
(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
justice
byron

but
the
--
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
possible
that
the
studio
or
at
least
the
partners
will
have
to
pay
taxes
on
money
they
haven't
received
but
the
bank
may
give
them
50%
in
their
financing
arrangement
with
the
bank
but
there
was
no
bank
involved
certainly
taxing
the
studio
on
the
face
value
of
$5000
note
only
as
thousand
dollars
that
was
paid
in
cash
means
that
--
it
means
if
they
pay
taxes
on
money
they
haven't
received
and
they
may
not
have
the
money
to
pay
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
--
on
a
negotiable
note
--
on
a
negotiable
note
endorsed
to
the
bank,
doesn't
the
commissioner
pretty
regularly
pays
the
face
amount?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
is
the
--
do
you
know
what
the
market
value
is
normally
on
this
notes
in
relation
to
the
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
to
the
extent
that
--
to
the
extent
that
the
studio
pays
taxes
on
money
that
it
hasn't
received
and
then
the
note
is
not
collected,
i
assume
these
are
endorse
with
recourse
then
the
--
the
bank
doesn't
suffer.
and
the
person
who
signed
the
note
can't
pay
the
note
or
won't
pay
it
and
it
is
never
paid.
then
how
can
the
taxpayer
reflect
in
its
tax
for
later
years
that
