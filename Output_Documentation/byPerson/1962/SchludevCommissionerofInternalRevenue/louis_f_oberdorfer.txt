mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
go
back
over
the
facts
just
briefly
to
use
them,
to
illustrate
the
principles
and
there
is
a
principle
that
is
at
issue
between
the
government
and
a
taxpayer
in
this
case.
the
question,
as
we
understand
it,
is
whether
this
accrual
payer
--
accrual-basis
taxpayer
can
defer
or
postpone
to
a
subsequent
taxable
year
or
years
amounts
which
the
taxpayer
has
received
in
cash
or
in
the
equivalent
of
cash
pursuant
to
a
contract,
a
very
strict
contract
which
makes
it
crystal
clear
that
under
no
circumstances
does
the
taxpayer
or
does
the
student
have
a
right
to
get
any
of
the
money
back.
and
--
so
that
everything
that
would
entitle
the
taxpayer
to
own
that
money,
to
use
that
money,
to
spend
that
money,
to
invest
that
money
has
occurred.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
this
is
the
place
where
--
where
we
parted
from
our
original
position,
mr.
justice
harlan.
there
are
three
elements
to
the
compensation:
one,
the
cash
payments;
two,
notes,
negotiable
promissory
notes
with
some
waiver
of
defenses
in
many
of
them,
which
are
enforceable
as
notes
irrespective
of
the
underlying
contract;
and
thirdly,
the
promise
to
pay.
now,
our
original
--
the
commissioner
originally
set
this
up
by
taking
in
to
income
the
face
amount
of
each
executory
contract.
we,
having
looked
at
that
more
closely,
and
the
service
having
looked
at
that
more
closely,
concluded
that
there
was
a
distinction
between
the
prepayment
in
cash
and
the
equivalent
of
cash
and
the
mere
executory
right.
if
i
may
invite
the
court's
attention
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
we
end
up
with
--
in
the
position
that
the
amount
accrued
includes
the
cash
paid
under
this
contract,
the
equivalents
of
cash,
namely
the
negotiable
notes
and
any
installment
due
on
a
particular
--
as
of
a
particular
time
or
the
value
of
any
lesson,
which
has
been
rendered.
the
mere
executory
promise
of
the
student
before
the
installment
is
due
and
before
the
services
are
rendered
are
not
included
in
income.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
they
accrue
when
either
a
payment,
an
installment
becomes
due
or
a
lesson
is
rendered.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it
could
be
in
--
it
would
--
this
would
only
involve
subsequent
tax
year
--
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
already
income.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
correct.
the
note
is
included
under
our
--
under
the
commissioner's
theory,
the
note
is
included
in
income.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
they
are
in
fact
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
--
discounted
or
they
would
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
actually
these
are
the
way
that
note
operates
in
the
way
--
in
this
particular
case,
the
notes
are
i
think
“discounted”
is
the
correct
word.
in
any
event,
they
are
turned
over
to
a
bank
for
collection
endorsed
to
the
bank.
and
the
bank
immediately
pays
50%
of
the
face
amount
of
the
note
less
some
charges
and
interests
and
then
as
the
bank
collects
on
the
note
or
when
the
bank
is
collected
on
the
note,
i'm
not
clear
whether
it
happens
as
payments
are
made
or
after
the
whole
note
is
paid
in
full,
the
bank
remits
to
the
taxpayer
the
balance
of
the
50%.
but
the
taxpayer
has
--
this
is
the
way
this
taxpayer
deals
with
these
negotiable
notes.
these
are
negotiable
notes
and
they
would
theoretically
be
subject
to
discount
or
sale
in
the
normal
commercial
channels.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
when
a
note
--
the
note
part
of
it,
the
commissioner
would
include
an
income
when
the
note
is
executed.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
with
respect
to
the
installments
due
in
the
future,
in
subsequent
years
on
accountable
essence
to
be
given
in
subsequent
years
with
respect
to
which
there's
been
no
cash
payment
and
no
note,
there
are
such
element.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
the
--
this
is
where
the
--
this
--
the
short
answer,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
is
that
the
government
is
delayed
in
its
use
of
tax
revenues
and
if
you
multiply
the
deferral
enjoyed
--
which
would
be
enjoyed
by
this
taxpayer
by
the
other
taxpayers
similarly
situated
who
would
be
able
to
--
talking
now
about
the
prepayments,
who
would
be
able
to
defer
tax
on
money
that
they
had
completely
in
control
and
in
possession,
there
would
be
the
--
the
lost
of
the
use
of
the
money
for
how
long
it
took
the
government
--
took
this
earning
process
which
they
advocate
to
work
itself
out.
it's
the
--
and
the
government
as
your
honor
well
knows
operates
on
a
fiscal
budget
and
this
is
why
the
annual
accounting
period,
the
annual
accounting
rule
comes
into
the
picture.
this
is
the
annual
accounting
period,
the
annual
accounting
rule
is
a
part
of
the
formulation
here
because
the
government
as
many
cases
--
many
opinions
of
this
court
have
ever
cited,
the
government
must
look
to
it's
--
to
the
ability
of
taxpayers
in
a
particular
year
to
pay
the
tax
for
that
year.
and
when
taxpayers
have
a
big
reserve
or
account
of
deferred
incomes
and
don't
pay
tax
on
it
and
this
is
--
this
taxpayer
and
millions
of
others
do
the
same
thing
that
becomes
a
fiscal
problem.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
i
think
as
taxpayer's
counsel
pointed
out
mr.
chief
justice,
the
--
in
this
--
under
this
--
in
--
on
the
facts
of
this
case
the
life
contract
is
always
worked
out
with
over
a
period
of
--
this
is
determinable
period
beyond
which
they
do
not
defer.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes,
sir,
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
sometimes
they
get
a
$5000
payment
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
--
on
the
signing
of
the
contract
and
work
it
out
over
a
period
of
time
that
at
least
1200
lessons
which
is
a
lot
of
lessons.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
in
sometime
--
i
assume
that
they
can
have
$5000
in
case
or
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
--
or
negotiable
notes,
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
which,
sir?
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
no,
sir.
it's
the
--
the
only
the
portion
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it
spread
--
let's
suppose
--
let's
take
the
1200
lessons
that
would
go
for
four
years
presumably
if
you
had
a
lesson
everyday.
i
suppose
it
would
take
long.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
300
lessons
a
year.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
don't
know
how
long
these
--
but
however
the
term
of
the
contract
is,
they
have
the
$5000
and
when
the
payment
is
made
and
they
take
into
income
a
portion
of
it,
a
numerator,
a
fraction
--
numerator
which
is
a
--
the
denominator
is
1200
and
the
numerator
is
a
number
of
lessons
given
in
a
particular
taxable
year.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
oh,
yes.
mr.
justice
harlan
this
is
the
place
where
--
this
is
why
i
say
this
is
an
issue
of
principle.
the
tax
concept
of
accrual
accounting
is
that
--
and
it's
stated
in
the
opinions
of
this
court
that
just
to
--
by
a
cash
basis
taxpayer
takes
in
the
income
what
he
receives
in
cash.
an
accrual-basis
taxpayer
takes
in
the
income
amounts
which
--
to
which
he
has
become
entitled
during
the
year,
all
the
--
the
all-events
test
applies
to
income
just
as
it
does
to
deductions.
an
accrual-basis
taxpayer
under
our
theory
is:
one,
who
includes
an
income
the
amounts
he's
received
plus
the
amounts
he
is
entitled
to.
and
we
think
that
by
definition,
this
just
go
--
the
whole,
including
the
part
a
taxpayer
who
has
obligated
himself
in
the
way
that
the
taxpayers
under
these
contracts
which
i
was
going
to
point
out
specifically
and
who
has
received
the
cash,
if
you
apply
the
all-events
test
to
that
kind
of
accrual-basis
taxpayer,
he
has
accrued
income
as
we
interpret
the
--
and
as
we
interpret
these
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it
--
in
this
con
--
in
this
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
--
context
--
in
this
context
where
the
taxpayer
is
--
just
possession
is
9/10ths
of
the
law,
they
see
he's
got
possession
in
all
the
other
rights
too.
possession
is
not
the
thing
that
defeats
and
can't
possibly
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
if
it
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
our
position
is
that
it
has
--
it
adds
--
it
makes
the
cheese
more
binding.
it
adds
to
accrual
considerably.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
justice
stewart
in
connection
with
the
last
--
the
last
remarks
about
the
effect
of
payment,
we
thought
that
the
court's
disposition
on
the
consolidated
edison
problem
perhaps
is
an
illustration
of
the
--
at
least
our
view
that
--
of
the
--
of
one
aspect
of
the
role
of
payment.
in
that
case,
if
your
honor
will
recall
there
was
a
payment
of
a
state
tax
in
one
year
and
under
protest
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
and
a
contest
which
continued
into
subsequent
years.
and
the
question
was
whether
the
payment
by
itself
in
that
context
in
no
circumstances
was
the
occasion
for
an
accrual.
and
the
court
held
that
the
--
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
where
the
taxpayer
resisted
the
idea
that
he
owed
the
tax.
and
the
payment
was
really
the
key
to
the
courthouse.
he
had
to
make
the
payment
in
order
to
get
into
court
that
in
that
case
the
payment
was
not
the
occasion
for
an
accrual.
but
just
taking
it
back
to
the
income
side,
it's
our
position
that
where
a
payment
is
made
with
no
legal
right
or
no
legal
liability
for
the
return
of
it
as
where
somebody
borrows
money
that
that
payment
is
ordinarily
an
accrual
even
though
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
there
on
the
deduction
side,
of
course
of
the
theory
and
this
is
something
that
maybe
this
system
is
subject
to
criticism
as
one
of
the
reasons
because
of
this
complex,
it
is
that
we
tried
to
take
the
position
that
this
is
--
this
whole
area
is
something
that
can
be
better
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
--
corrected
by
legislation.
but
the
prepaid
rent
on
the
deduction
side
has
been
considered
traditionally
as
a
--
like
any
other
expenditure
which
has
a
--
which
buy
something
whether
the
value
or
usefulness
for
more
than
one
year
is
a
capital
expenditure
and
the
formulation
is
that
that's
capitalized
and
spread
over
the
years.
i
don't
believe
that
in
the
law
at
least
the
same
idea
has
been
honored
up
to
now
on
the
income
side.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
right.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
on
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that
is
correct.
now,
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
the
commissioner
has
ruled
in
a
ruling,
it's
quoted
at
length
in
our
brief
that
this
prepayment
of
rent
is
income
in
full
on
receipt
to
a
lessor.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes,
prepayment
is
income
to
an
accrual-basis
taxpayer.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that
is
treated
i
believe
as
income
also.
that's
ruling
which
in
fact
located
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
on
--
it
was
quoted
at
length
on
page
51
of
our
brief.
i
believe
describes
the
peti
--
the
commissioner's
policy
on
this
issue.
this
was
published
in
1960.
the
service
will
continue
as
policy
of
taxing
pre
(inaudible)
--
general
policy
of
taxing
prepaid
income
in
the
year
of
receipt.
this
policy
applies
to
income
from
contracts
to
furnish
services
and
to
other
types
of
prepaid
income
such
as
prepaid
royalties,
rents,
bonuses,
etcetera
regardless
of
whether
the
period
of
proration
is
definite
or
indefinite.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
correct,
this
is
merely
--
this
assumes
that
premises
that
this
is
income
sooner
or
later,
it's
a
question
of
when.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
--
it
just
takes
--
it
just
pushes
the
receipt
of
revenue
back
to
another
or
some
other
several
fiscal
years
and
it
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
--
that
would
be
the
effect
of
a
general
ruling
of
this
court
in
--
to
the
--
on
the
basis
that
the
taxpayers
have
asked
the
court
to
rule.
in
other
words,
the
legislative
proposals
that
have
been
under
consideration,
the
bill
that
was
passed
by
congress
and
then
repealed
would
have
protected
the
revenue
against
that
consequence
by
providing
for
transition
adjustments
or
at
least
its
failure
to
provide
that
causes
them
to
repeal
it.
now,
the
bill
that
was
passed
after
the
enactment
of
the
--
at
decision
of
this
--
by
this
court
in
the
three
a's
case
for
the
relief
of
membership
corporations
has
a
transition
adjustment
in
it
so
that
the
revenue
that
--
it's
faced
out.
if
--
there
would
be
a
subs
--
i
don't
have
this
in
dollars
and
cents
but
if
every
taxpayer
can
now
defer
tax
on
prepaid
income
although
he
has
complete
possession
of
it
and
has
the
ability
to
pay
the
tax
from
it,
it
would
have
--
i'm
sure
have
noticeable
fiscal
consequences.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
actually
the
basis
for
the
tax
should
be
the
market
value
of
that
note,
not
its
face
value.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
believe
the
position
is
market
value.
i
think
we
have
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
do
not.
somewhere
i
suppose
above
50%
since
they
get
50%
right
out.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
they
get
a
--
they
get
a
deduction
in
the
year
in
which
the
note
--
they
get
a
bad
debt
deduction
in
the
year
in
which
the
note
becomes
uncollectable.
and
of
course,
accrual-basis
taxpayers
assume
never
--
most
people
who
are
in
business
make
a
profit.
accrual-basis
taxpayers
are
accruing
more
--
ordinarily
are
accruing
income
and
accruing
expenses
in
advance
to
the
actual
--
in
addition
to
the
actual
cash
receipts
and
payments
and
in
advance
of
them
so
that
in
every
year
the
accrual-basis
taxpayer
is
presumably
paying
tax
on
some
money
that
he
doesn't
have
or
at
least
his
tax
is
measured
in
that
way,
this
is
the
connection
between
the
claim-of-right
theory.
this
keeps
cropping
up
in
the
discussions
of
this
issue
and
we
are
pilloried
for
claiming
that
this
case
is
governed
by
the
claim-of-right
or
because
we
fail
to
stick
to
our
guns
on
the
claim-of-right
theory.
we
don't
--
it
isn't
our
position
that
this
is
controlled
by
the
claim
of
right
but
the
claim
of
right
concept
is
filtered
through
the
idea
of
an
accrual-basis
taxpayer
accruing
amounts
which
he
has
completely
in
his
possession
dominion
and
control.
the
system
presumably
would
--
operates
when
an
--
when
a
taxpayer
includes
an
income
all
of
the
items
with
respect
to
which
all
the
events
entitling
him
to
the
income
have
occurred.
that
includes
naturally
some
items
which
he's
actually
received
in
cash
thus
(inaudible)
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
excused
from
payment
by
whom?
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
by
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
now,
and
--
you're
assuming
a
case
where
this
is
a
negotiated
arrangement
between
the
bank
and
the
studio
on
one
side,
and
the
student
on
the
other.
this
isn't
a
matter
of
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
there
would
be
a
--
presumably
an
adjustment.
i
can't
stand
here
and
say
how
it
would
be
adjusted
but
there
should
be
an
adjustment
for
that
taxpayer.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
he's
liable.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
oh,
well,
that's
--
i
would
think
he
--
that
the
studio
would
then
get
a
bad
debt
deduction
having
a
debt
that
is
--
having
accrued
an
item
which
is
not
collectable.
the
law
allows
a
deduction
in
those
circumstances
at
that
time.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes,
sir.
that's
our
theory
of
how
the
accrual
basis
should
work
and
i
believe
that's
the
way
the
law
is
administered.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
the
three
a's?
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
no,
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that
is
--
i'm
not
aware
of
it
but
i
don't
believe
that
it
appears
in
the
face
of
that
legislative
history.
however,
the
provision
of
the
1954
code
that
was
enacted
and
then
repealed
would
have
given
relief
here.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
we
--
we
have
--
we
believe
that
section
41
ex
--
i
say
dealt
with
it.
section
41
--
as
we
construe
section
41
it
authorizes
the
--
it
--
if
as
interpreted
by
this
court,
it
operates
the
accrual
system
in
the
way
that
i
thought
i
described
it
which
has
some
hardships
in
it.
that
is
the
taxpayer
accrues
items
of
income
as
all
the
events
entitling
him
to
that
income
occur.
and
accrues
items
of
expense
and
deducts
them
as
all
of
the
events
which
create
an
obligation
on
him
to
pay
the
expense
occurred.
congress
would
--
could,
as
it
did
briefly
in
the
1954
code,
as
it
has
with
respect
to
prepaid
subscriptions,
and
as
it
had
with
respect
to
membership
corporations
specifically
authorized
the
deferral
of
tax
on
certain
prepayments.
or
as
the
treasury
has
by
regulations
which
it
now
become
embodied
in
the
law
by
a
virtue
of
long
acceptance
by
the
congress
permitted
taxpayers
to
defer
income
on
certain
long
term
contracts,
the
percentage
of
completion
method
for
treatment
of
some
construction
contracts
or
the
completed
contract
method
under
which
the
tax
on
that
the
--
that
the
income
from
performance
of
a
construction
contract
if
the
taxpayers
so
elects
is
not
taxed
until
the
contract
is
completed
and
the
taxpayer
adds
up
how
much
he
received
for
performing
the
contract
and
how
much
the
contract
costs
him
and
then
includes
an
income
in
the
year
of
completion
they
met
and
nothing
more.
but
the
congress
is
doing
this
by
--
on
a
selective
basis
and
it
seems
--
we
feel
that
the
--
that
sort
of
division
of
labor
if
i
may
between
the
judicial
process,
the
administrative
process
and
the
legislative
process
is
something
that
we
would
advocate.
we
--
the
one
final
point
so
far
as
the
comparison
between
this
system
which
has
in
terms
of
its
artificiality
as
that
word
is
used
in
the
three
a's
and
in
the
automobile
club
case
is
concerned,
we
point
out
that
the
contract
provides
unless
you
make
an
appointment,
your
lesson
is
canceled
that
the
performance
is
that
the
demand
of
the
student
and
they
--
as
the
--
as
counsel
has
said
the
--
there
is
no
day-by-day
specificity
for
performance.
this
system
doesn't
even
take
into
account
what
they
concede
to
be
an
experience
of
about
17%
cancelations.
there
is
no
adjustment
to
the
amount
deferred
on
account
of
the
expectation
that
as
experiences
demonstrated
that
about
17%
of
the
students
either
die
or
become
disabled
or
just
quit.
and
we
think
that
while
this
is
a
different
kind
of
artificiality
from
that
which
the
court
described
in
the
three
a's
case,
it
still
doesn't
meet
the
standards
that
were
inferred
in
automobile
club
of
michigan
and
the
three
a.
thank
you,
sir.
