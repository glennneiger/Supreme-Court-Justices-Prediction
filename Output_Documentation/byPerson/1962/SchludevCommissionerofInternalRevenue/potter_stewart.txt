in
a.
a.
a.,
the
projected
costs
were
based
on
averages,
weren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
which
were
--
the
court
held
too
speculative?
justice
potter
stewart
here,
you
have
an
individual
record
on
an
individual
card
of
each
customer
of
the
studio
each
student,
so-called
dance
student,
with
an
obligation
to
give
that
student
the
number
of
lessons
for
which
he
had
contracted?
justice
potter
stewart
within
a
specified
time?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
there
was
no
projection
of
averages
or
--
none
of
that
speculative
element
in
this
case
that
which
was
the
point
upon
which
the
a.
a.
a.
case
turned,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
is
one
aspect
of
this
case
in
which
the
government
concedes
that
the
commissioner
was
in
error
that
is
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
future
installments?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
that
aspect
that
would
cause
such
an
impact
upon
your
business,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
rather
than
the
basic
payment
you've
been
arguing?
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
the
government
concedes
you're
right
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
a
receipt
though
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
something
is
accrued,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
say
--
i
don't
say
receipt,
it
means
that
it
hasn't
been
accrued
but
it
does
--
nor
does
it
mean
that
it
has
been.
i
just
think
i
had
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
asking
you
whether
receipt
had
anything
to
do
with
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
(inaudible)
--
i'm
thinking
of
some
any
other
areas,
some
any
other
possible
examples,
for
example
a
lease
with
a
payment
to
the
lessor
of
more
than
a
year's
lease
in
advance
payment
and
those
(inaudible)
--
and
it
accrue,
assuming
accrual-basis
taxpayer?
justice
potter
stewart
left
to
congress?
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
lessor?
income
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
the
lessor?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
an
accrual
basis
assuming
the
lessor
is
an
accrual-basis
taxpayer?
justice
potter
stewart
the
payment
wouldn't
be
or
would
it
be,
under
your
view?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
in
the
accrual
basis?
justice
potter
stewart
if
--
assuming
on
accrual
basis.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
prepayment
of
say
a
five-year
insurance
premium?
