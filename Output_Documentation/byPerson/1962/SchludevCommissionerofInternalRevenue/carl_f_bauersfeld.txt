mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
income
tax
case.
the
issue
is
whether
the
accrual
method
of
accounting
be
continue
to
be
used
for
income
tax
purposes
where
advance
receipts
are
involved.
by
the
accrual
method
of
accounting
is
meant
the
taxpayer's
recognition
of
income
when
earned
by
performance
whether
before
or
after
payment
and
the
deduction
of
expenses
as
incurred
whether
before
or
after
actual
payment.
the
facts
necessary
to
understand
the
issue
here
present
may
be
very
briefly
stated.
the
taxpayer
is
--
of
partner
in
a
partnership
that
gave
them
instruction
services
under
a
contract
for
students.
the
students
made
down
payment
and
agreed
to
pay
the
balance
of
the
contract
price
in
installments.
the
service
contract
is
given
rise
to
the
tax
controversy
here
where
those
as
to
which
the
student
--
the
taxpayer's
performance
extended
beyond
the
taxable
period
in
which
the
contracts
were
entered
into.
certified
public
accounting
firm
designed
to
partnerships
bookkeeping
system
on
the
accrual
basis
accurately
to
match
partnerships
revenue
derived
from
services
rendered
in
each
tax
year
with
the
costs
of
rendering
services
in
such
year.
and
i
will
explain
the
exact
detail
of
the
accounting
system
shortly
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
the
respondent
initially
required
the
partnership
to
include
as
income
the
entire
face
amount
of
each
contract
in
the
tax
year
in
which
it
was
entered
into.
the
respondent
has
now
retreated
from
that
position
in
this
court,
but
his
confession
does
not,
in
any
way,
change
or
alter
the
basic
issue.
the
respondent
now
says
that
the
entire
face
amount
of
each
contract
need
not
be
taken
into
consideration
or
into
income
at
the
time
that
is
signed
but
he
still
contends
that
all
advance
receipts
actually
received
by
a
partnership
for
future
instruction
must
be
reported
as
income
no
later
than
the
year
in
which
the
receipt
--
receipt
is
obtained
and
that
all
other
amounts
under
the
contracts
are
to
be
reportable
in
the
tax
year
when
the
students
were
obligated
to
make
payments.
the
respondent
relying
on
the
american
automobile
associate
versus
the
united
states
in
367,
u.s.
urges
that
any
accrual
accounting
system
for
deferring
recognition
of
advance
receipts
must
be
rejected
as
violating
tax
accounting
principles.
here,
we
differ
very
greatly
with
the
respondent.
if
that
case
is
read
as
we
believe
is
proper
then
it
is
clear
that
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
in
relevant
tax
statute
authorized
an
accrual-basis
taxpayer
to
be
taxed
on
advanced
receipts
only
in
the
year
in
which
they
are
earned.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
respondent
is
correct
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
a.a.a.
case,
accrual-basis
taxpayers
will
be
required
to
use
the
cash
method
of
accounting
when
that
--
whenever
they
are
paid
advance
receipts
by
their
customers.
now,
incidentally
by
advance
receipts,
i
mean
any
payments
received
before
being
earned
by
performance
either
by
rendering
services
or
providing
goods
as
the
case
may
be.
the
american
automobile
association,
we
believe,
did
not
reject
the
use
of
the
accrual
principle
as
such
for
reporting
advance
receipts
of
income
in
the
tax
year
in
which
they
are
earned.
it
did
reject
the
application
of
that
principle
because
of
defects
in
bringing
together
the
specific
--
the
costs
of
earning
them
with
the
receipts
in
that
particular
case.
we
contend
that
in
a.
a.
a.,
the
court
ruled
only
that
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
was
incurred
to
disregard
the
method
of
accrual
accounting
for
advance
receipt
used
by
the
taxpayer
there
because
the
method
did
not
precisely
match
the
portion
of
the
costs
of
performing
services
or
the
association's
individual
members
in
the
tax
year
with
the
proper
portion
of
advance
dues
paid
by
each
member.
the
association's
accrual
accounting
procedures
required
only
that
dues
be
recorded
as
income
for
tax
purposes
on
a
month-by-month
basis
ratably
over
the
membership
period.
without
regard
to
the
actual
costs
of
services
rendered
of
the
members
for
performance
require,
the
court
found
that
the
accounting
system
used
by
the
association
did
not
accurately
and
precisely
matched
revenues
with
related
costs
because
the
system
would
base
on
statistical
computations
and
calculations
and
averages
reflecting
the
overall
costs
of
rendering
services
to
all
its
members
on
a
(inaudible)
--
accrual
basis.
the
association
i
emphasized
was
unable
to
show
that
the
method
of
deferral
used
for
any
relationship
to
the
services
yet
to
be
performed
or
that
the
services
to
be
performed
would
be
equal
for
each
member.
for
this
reason,
we
believe,
the
case
stands
only
for
the
proposition
that
the
accrual
method
of
accounting
they're
use
was
so
imprecise
that
the
commissioner's
decision
to
set
it
aside
was
not
arbitrary.
now,
by
contrast
here
--
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
the
american
automobile
association
case.
by
contrast
here,
the
taxpayer's
accrual
accounting
system
precisely
match
revenues
from
services
they
performed
in
each
tax
year
with
related
costs
of
performance.
this
was
accomplished
primarily
through
the
use
of
individual
or
accounting
cards
for
each
student.
at
each
contract
was
signed,
the
total
contract
price
was
recorded
in
an
account
entitled
“deferred
income”.
the
individual
student
accounting
cards
identified
each
student,
the
hours
of
dancing
instruction
contracted
for,
the
total
contract
price,
the
hours
of
instruction
given,
the
payments
made
under
each
contract
and
at
the
end
of
each
partnership
tax
year,
the
accounting
card
for
each
student
was
reviewed.
and
the
amount
of
income
earned
under
each
contract
was
determined
by
multiplying
the
number
of
hours
those
instruction
given
by
the
rate
per
hour
on
that
contract.
and
whether
cash
in
the
amount
of
such
income
had
been
paid
by
the
student
or
not,
the
deferred
income
account
was
reduced
by
the
actual
amount
earned
and
earned
income
account
increased
by
the
same
amount.
such
earned
income
from
all
contracts
was
totaled
and
reported
as
income
on
the
accrual
basis
in
the
partnerships
tax
return
for
that
year.
since
expenses
were
incurred
in
the
period
that
the
partnership
rendered
the
services
under
the
contract,
the
accounting
method
used
precisely
matched
receipts
and
expenses
for
that
period.
in
addition,
i
should
point
out
that
all
gains
arising
from
the
cancelation
of
a
contract
by
a
student
or
by
the
studio
where
there
was
no
activity
on
the
contract
for
a
year
was
also
reported
as
income
on
the
tax
return.
as
a
result,
there
was
absolutely
no
way
the
studio
could
defer
reporting
receipts
as
income
indefinitely.
it
could
not
therefore
avoid
any
taxes.
and
so
the
issue
here
is
only
the
year
of
taxability.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
respondents
seriously
dispute
the
accuracy
of
the
partnership
system
in
--
system
in
matching
revenues
with
related
costs.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
our
system
is
different
from
the
a.
a.
a.
in
that
we
have
a
definite
obligation
to
perform
specific
services
for
a
specific
individual
members
not
based
upon
a
member's
demand.
we
contract
to
give
dancing
lessons
and
they
are
taken
in
the
subsequent
year.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
the
contracts
do
not
provide
a
schedule
of
date.
they
do
provide
that
all
the
lessons
must
be
taken
within
a
certain
period
of
time.
there
is
an
expiration
date
in
each
con
--
contract
in
there
--
contract
provided
that
the
studio
will
give
the
lessons
required
within
that
period.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
in
the
a.
a.
a.
case
sir,
there
was
just
a
mere
availability
of
services,
a
member
might
demand
--
ban
the
services
or
he
might
not
depending
upon
his
individual
needs.
here,
the
studio
and
the
students
enters
into
a
direct
contract
for
--
to
give
so
many
hours
of
dancing
lessons.
and
the
studio
did
those
lessons.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
that
is
the
way
we
read
them
as
this
was
offered
them.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
when
i
explain
that
--
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
sir,
it
vary
from
time
to
time
as
all
costs
over
the
years.
i
understand
the
costs
about
$5000.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
and
--
and
the
--
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
sometimes,
yes
sir.
now,
let
me
--
i
would
like
to
say
this
that
a
lifetime
contract
implemented
1000
to
1200
hours
of
specific
lessons
and
then
thereafter
the
student
was
entitled
to
two
lessons
a
month
for
life
with
two
parties
a
year.
but
at
the
time
of
the
completion
of
the
1000
hours
or
the
1200
hours
all
the
income
under
that
contract
had
been
taken
into
consideration.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
respondent's
real
argument
is
--
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
i
did
not
--
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
in
the
congress
in
a.
a.
a.
passed
a
set
--
special
statute
that
authorized
the
use
of
the
accounting
system
a.
a.
a.
had,
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
no
sir,
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
a.
a.
a.
or
similar
membership
club.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
we
do
not
qualify
under
that,
yes
sir.
respondent's
real
argument
is
that
the
american
automobile
association
has
a
far
broader
meaning.
the
respondent
says
that
the
court
intended
to
proscribe
the
use
of
any
accrual
accounting
method
no
matter
how
precisely
it
match
the
revenues
with
the
expenses
where
advance
receipts
are
involved.
respondent
points
to
the
discussion
in
the
opinion
regarding
the
legislative
history
of
the
enactment
and
the
repeal
of
sections
452,
462
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
this
portion
of
the
court's
opinion,
the
respondent
asserts,
recognized
as
in
the
commissioner
the
discretionary
power
to
bar
the
use
for
tax
purposes
of
any
method
of
accounting
or
advance
receipts
no
matter
how
accurate
and
how
precise
if
it
may
involve
the
reporting
of
such
receipts
of
income
in
a
subsequent
tax
year.
we
believe
the
respondent
misinterprets
the
opinion
and
that
the
actual
holding
of
the
court
in
a.
a.
a.
was
stated
clearly
and
succinctly
by
mr.
justice
clark
at
page
693
and
i
quote,
“the
federal
revenue
cannot
without
legislative
consent
and
over
objection
of
the
commissioner
be
made
to
depend
upon
average
experience
in
rendering
performance
and
turning
a
profit”.
the
court's
concern
was
with
the
method
of
accrual
accounting
that
is
dependent
upon
average
experiences
of
relating
costs
and
revenue.
accordingly,
we
believe
the
consideration
in
the
american
automobile
of
the
legislative
history,
of
the
june
1954
code
provisions
had
relevance
only
to
the
particular
type
of
accrual
accounting
method
that
was
there
at
issue
in
which
overall
activities
and
averages
of
expense
where
relied
upon
in
determining
reportable
income.
now,
the
case
at
bar
does
not
depend
upon
statistical
calculations,
estimates,
or
average
experienced.
we
are
correct
in
our
interpretation
of
american
automobile
decision
and
we
submit
that
the
applicable
revenue
statutes
in
the
long
line
of
decisions
of
this
court
support
our
position
that
an
accrual-basis
taxpayer
having
a
precise
and
accurate
accounting
met
--
system
may
defer
the
recognition
of
advance
receipts
to
the
tax
year
in
which
those
receipts
are
earned
by
performance.
the
respondent's
argument
that
income
of
accrues
at
the
time
payments
are
received
is
in
conflict
with
sections
41
and
42
of
the
1939
code
and
446
and
451
--
51
of
the
1954
code.
and
4
--
section
42
of
the
1939
code,
is
short
and
i
like
to
read
it,
“the
amount
of
all
items
of
gross
income
shall
be
included
in
the
year
--
year
in
the
tax
full
--
included
gross
income
for
the
tax
full
year
in
which
received
by
the
taxpayer
unless
under
methods
of
accounting
permitted
under
section
41
and
the
accrual
method
is
such
a
method,
any
such
amounts
are
to
be
properly
accounted
for
as
of
a
different
period”.
section
41
directs
that
the
method
of
accounting
used
by
the
taxpayer
in
keeping
his
books
shall
govern
the
computations
of
his
net
income.
and
it
is
only
when
that
method
of
accounting
used
by
the
taxpayer
in
keeping
his
books
does
not
clearly
reflect
income
that
the
commissioner
has
a
discretion
to
compute
his
tax
by
another
method.
the
decisions
of
this
court,
court
interpreting
these
provisions
of
a
taxing
statute,
which
this
--
which
have
remained
substantially
unchanged
since
1918
sustain
our
position
that
advance
receipts
are
to
be
reported
as
income
only
when
earned
by
performance.
in
united
states
versus
anderson,
in
269
u.s.,
this
court
interpreted
the
tax
accounting
provisions
of
the
revenue
act
of
1960,
which
was
the
first
tax
statute
that
permitted
accrual
accounting.
the
court
there
required
the
taxpayer
to
accrue
munitions
taxes
as
a
deduction
in
a
year
prior
to
the
year
in
which
the
tax
became
due
and
prior
to
the
year
in
which
the
taxpayer
actually
pay
the
munitions
taxes.
in
ruling
that
the
taxes
had
accrued
in
the
year
that
the
munitions
to
which
the
taxes
related
were
sold,
the
court
declared
the
purpose
of
congress
in
authorizing
the
use
of
the
accrual
method
was
and
i
quote,
“to
enable
taxpayers
to
keep
their
books
and
make
their
returns
according
to
scientific
accounting
principles
by
charging
against
income
earned
during
the
taxable
period,
the
expenses
incurred
in,
and
properly
attributable
to
the
process
of
earning
income
during
that
period”.
this
case
further
pointed
out
that
the
statute
was
not
concerned
with
due
date
for
payment
of
the
tax
in
a
technical
legal
sense,
rather,
the
accounting
provisions
of
the
statute
were
to
be
interpreted
in
an
economic
and
bookkeeping
sense.
and
it
is
significant
to
note
as
pointed
out
in
the
brief
for
the
amicus
that
the
position
that
the
government
is
now
taking
is
diametrically
opposed
to
its
position
in
anderson.
in
the
government's
brief
there,
it
said
that
the
accrual
accounting
methods
are
designed
to
reflect
income
definitely
earned.
another
case
spring
city
foundry
co.
versus
commissioner
in
292
u.s.
involved
the
use
of
the
accrual
accounting
methods
in
determining
when
income
was
to
be
reported.
it
recognized
that
the
accrual
accounting
might
require
the
taxpayer
to
report
income
before
he
receives
any
payment
as
a
result
of
transaction
that
gives
rise
to
tax.
the
court
declared
that
for
an
accrual-basis
taxpayer,
it
is
the
right
to
receive
not
the
actual
receipt
that
determines
the
inclusion
of
amount
in
gross
income.
when
the
right
to
receive
an
amount
becomes
fixed,
the
right
accrued.
and
then
the
court
made
it
clear
that
it
understood
the
right
to
receive
to
be
related
to
the
earning
of
income
because
the
opinion
continues
and
says,
“when
a
merchandising
concern
make
sales,
its
inventory
is
reduced
and
a
claim
for
the
purchase
price
arises”.
now,
such
sales
do
not
occur
merely
by
the
signing
of
a
contract
or
even
when
payment
is
due
under
a
contract
as
the
respondent
here
urges
but
rather
when
a
taxpayer
performs
under
the
contract
or
in
the
accounting
terms
used
by
the
court
in
that
case,
when
there
are
accounts
receivable
arising
from
sale.
finally
and
most
recently,
in
united
states
versus
consolidated
edison
in
366
u.s.,
it
was
held
that
the
accrual-basis
taxpayer's
deduction
for
a
contested
tax
is
properly
taken
in
the
tax
year
to
which
a
final
determination
of
liability
for
the
tax
is
made
even
though
the
tax
had
been
paid
in
a
prior
year.
this
court
rejected
the
commissioner's
position
that
the
liability
accrued
not
later
than
the
year
of
payment
and
said
neither
the
government
nor
an
accrual-basis
taxpayer
may
cause
an
item
to
be
deducted
in
a
year
other
than
one
in
which
it
accrue.
now,
this
statement
although
made
in
a
case
involving
the
timing
of
deductions
by
an
accrual-basis
taxpayer
is
equally
applicable
in
determining
the
tax
year
for
which
the
taxpayers
are
to
report
advance
receipts
as
income.
in
addition,
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
several
decisions
involving
cash
basis
taxpayer
such
as
united
states
versus
lewis
and
burnet
versus
sanford
&
brooks
company
in
282
u.s.,
which
the
respondent
has
cited
frequently
in
his
brief.
in
these
cases,
the
court
explicitly
recognized
the
difference
between
--
the
difference
between
tax
accounting
for
cash
basis
taxpayers
and
accrual-basis
taxpayers.
in
particular,
that
taxes
are
to
be
paid
on
a
basis
of
receipts
only
by
cash
basis
taxpayers.
for
example,
in
burnet
versus
sanford
&
brooks
company,
the
court
said
that
items
of
gross
income
are
required
to
be
included
in
gross
income
for
the
taxable
year
in
which
receipt
by
the
taxpayer
unless
they
may
be
accounted
for
on
the
accrual
basis.
we
urge
that
these
decisions
and
others
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
the
brief
of
the
amicus
call
for
the
rejection
of
the
respondent's
position
that
the
commissioner
may
set
aside
a
method
of
accrual
accounting
solely
because
it
postponed
the
reporting
as
income
of
amounts
received
to
a
tax
year
subsequent
to
the
year
of
the
receipt.
this,
in
essence,
completes
the
taxpayer's
position.
before
closing,
i
should
say
that
the
government's
dispute
with
our
position
apart
from
the
american
automobile
association
case
is
grounded
basically
on
two
legal
doctrines
which
are
repeatedly
referred
to
throughout
its
brief.
these
are
the
annual
accounting
requirement
and
the
claim-of-right
doctrine.
we
do
not
understand
the
relevancy
of
these
doctrines
to
this
case.
we
believe
that
they
have
been
discredited
as
the
basis
for
taxing
advance
receipts
of
accrual-basis
taxpayer
in
the
year
of
receipt.
in
here,
the
same
opinion
in
the
american
automobile
association
case,
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
that
the
court
does
not
base
its
decision
on
this
theory
referring
into
the
annual
accounting
requirement
presumably
because
the
court
believes
as
i
do
that
the
theory
is
not
valid.
likewise,
in
the
american
automobile,
the
respond
--
the
respondent
pointing
to
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
harlan
in
the
automobile
club
of
michigan,
there
agreed
that
the
so-called
claim-of-right
doctrine
was
not
applicable
and
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
american
automobile,
it
was
specifically
pointed
out
the
government
had
abandon
the
claim-of-right
doctrine
in
that
case.
now,
we
will
reserve
until
later
our
reputation
of
what
the
government
has
to
say
about
these
two
doctrines.
we
do
hope,
however,
that
government
will
explain
why
it
is
that
it
now
seeks
to
ground
its
case
on
the
annual
accounting
requirement
in
the
claim-of-right
doctrine.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
it
will
make
a
very
--
sir
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
over
the
long
run,
it
will
make
a
tremendous
--
tremendous
difference.
in
fact
this
company
would
probably
be
bankrupt.
it
could
make
that
much
difference.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
the
--
under
the
determination
of
the
commissioner
they,
determined
that
all
--
i
--
all
--
the
entire
contract
price
of
the
contracts
was
income
at
the
time
it
was
signed.
and
we
show
in
--
the
record
shows
that
over
20%
of
all
contracts
that
was
--
were
so
signed
were
cancelled,
a
student
never
went
and
--
went
through
with
it,
never
made
payments
and
if
you
don't
match
the
costs
in
the
same
tax
year,
you
get
a
complete
distortion
of
income.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
no
sir,
(voice
overlap),
not
under
the
method
we
used.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
may
it
please
the
court.
one
of
the
things
that
show
the
distortion
of
income
that
would
result
is
in
the
case
of
where
we
have
a
note
which
is
discounted
--
not
discounted
but
negotiated
with
the
bank.
in
those
cases,
the
record
specifically
found
that
the
studio
could
not
receive
the
50%
that
was
retained
by
the
bank
until
after
the
student
made
the
full
payment
on
the
contract.
so
for
example,
if
we
had
a
contract
which
provided
with
a
note
for
$50
which
was
negotiated
with
the
bank
and
the
studio
would
receive
$50
and
then
it
would
not
get
the
other
$50
until
the
student
have
made
a
complete
payment
on
account,
therefore,
we
didn't
have
a
legal
right
to
receive
the
amount
even
under
the
commissioner's
theory
of
the
balance
of
the
$50
in
the
tax
year
or
at
the
time
the
contract
was
signed.
and
the
--
as
a
result
of
this
and
other
things
the
--
it
ends
up
with
--
the
effect
of
it
is
to
buildup
income
at
the
time
the
contracts
are
signed
in
one
year
and
then
have
that
income
subjected
to
tax
rate
at
a
higher
rate
and
then
when
the
performance
is
given
in
a
subsequent
tax
year,
we
have
a
distortion.
and
because
of
the
tax
rates,
it
means
much
more
revenue
would
accrue
to
the
government.
the
1951
statute
authorizing
membership
organizations
to
use
an
accrual
accounting
system
as
that
--
that
found
in
american
automobile
association
dealt
with
that
particular
type
of
accrual
accounting
system
where
they
had
to
use
statistics
and
other
things
we
feel.
here,
we
have
the
statute
41
and
42
which
is
always
are
permitted
the
use
of
the
accrual
accounting
system.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
not
to
my
knowledge,
sir.
i
can't
answer
you
positively
but
i
have
no
knowledge
that
they
did.
lifetime
courses
which
we
have
mentioned
here
are
only
--
really
unusual.
we
don't
have
many
of
that
type
most
of
them
are
for
a
lots
--
less
amount
involved.
in
--
and
the
whole
system,
i
don't
believe,
should
look
--
to
be
looked
just
through
lifetime
course
alone.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
i
think
the
record
in
this
case
will
show
that
it
was
a
growing
business
over
the
years
that
we
had
involved
sir,
five-year
period
that
it's
disclosed
by
the
record.
sales
increased
--
decreased
each
year
but
since
then
some
times
have
not
been
so
good.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
in
a
good
broad
way,
they
were
about
the
same
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
it
would
not
be
near
so
harsh
as
in
the
--
in
--
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
it
would
completely
distort
it.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
the
rate
of
tax
would
have
a
lot
to
do
with
the
job.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
i
think
they
make
some
service
charge,
sir.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
the
end
of
the
period
and
it
so
specifically
stipulated
in
the
case.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes,
sir.
in
fact
there
was
a
collection
procedure
because
the
students
would
be
more
readily
inclined
to
pay
the
bank
they
would
the
studio.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
that
is
correct.
the
full
recourse
of
the
notes
are
transferred,
the
bank
fully
because
it
was
really
i
think
in
the
--
and
the
record
shows
where
the
collection
procedure
in
a
large
--
to
a
large
extent.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
i
--
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
i'm
sorry,
sir.
i
can't
answer
the
question,
i
just
don't
know.
i'm
not
sure
the
record
shows.
mr.
carl
f.
bauersfeld
i
think
that
they
do
have
progressive
courses
and
they
give
them
awards
and
have
other
sales
features.
we
--
the
--
this
case
really
presents
the
questions
as
i
stated
in
the
beginning
as
to
whether
an
accrual
basis
of
method
of
accounting
may
continue
to
be
used
where
there
are
advanced
receipts
involved.
now,
we
don't
care
what
--
what
the
system
may
be
designated
as
but
it
certainly
is
not
the
accrual
method
of
accounting
if
you're
required
to
take
in
advance
receipts
before
they
are
earned
by
performance.
