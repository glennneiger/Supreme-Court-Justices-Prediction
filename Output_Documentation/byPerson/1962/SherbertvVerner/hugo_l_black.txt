justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
that
the
--
the
state
now,
does
it
get
any
part
of
their
funds
from
the
federal
government
or
if
it's
all
collected
as
a
state
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
extent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
federal
statute
have
any
strings
attached
to
it
in
anyway
or
any
conditions
with
which
the
states
have
to
comply
in
connection
to
getting
the
money?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
any
matter.
i'm
just
wondering
frankly
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
this
is
a
matter
in
which
the
federal
government
would
be
sufficiently
interested
why
they
should
be
present.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
are
not
met,
what
happens?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
federal
government
does
have
an
actual
interest
in
the
way
these
funds
are
administered,
does
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
excuse
me,
i
ask
because
i
saw
no
reference
to
the
federal
laws
in
either
brief
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
i
had
an
idea
that
they
might
be
--
might
be
applied
to
these
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
they
know
what
interest
the
federal
government
had
in
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
would
be
interested
in
this,
i
should
think.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
we
were
to
hold,
suppose
the
court
should
hold
your
state
law
in
this
respect
violates
the
federal
constitution,
what
effect
would
that
have
on
the
federal
statute
for
unemployed
insurance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
appreciate
that
because
frankly,
i
didn't
think
about
it
until
i
looked
for
the
federal
statute,
it
doesn't
seem
that
it's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
wouldn't
be
any
federal
involvement
if
we
were
to
hold
if
one
of
the
state
security
system
in
which
they
are
end
of
the
[inaudible]
as
i
recall
it,
certain
standards
have
to
be
followed.
they
act
with
it.
it
wouldn't
affect
the
federal
statutes
for
us
to
hold
that
this
is
unconstitutional
in
that
respect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
your
statute
provided
--
it
now
provides
other
statute
which
mr.
justice
goldberg
called
your
attention
to
that
they
can
get
off
of
the
conscientious
reason
on
sunday,
suppose
your
statute
provided
only
that
people
who
did
not
want
to
work
on
saturday
could
be
excused
for
conscientious
reasons
but
others
could
not,
what
would
you
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
about
your
statute
to
which
mr.
justice
goldberg
called
your
attention?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
--
suppose
if
the
legislature
want
to
make
it
saturday
and
it
said
that
those
who
had
conscientious
reasons
to
get
working
on
saturday.
it
attaches
conscientious
reasons.
the
cases
the
court
held
at
least
the
majority,
believed
that
the
statutes
were
not
based
at
this
time
on
any
distinction
because
of
religion,
it
was
a
day
of
rest,
but
here,
your
statute
says,
they
want
to
get
up
on
sunday
for
a
conscientious
reasons
and
why
wouldn't
it
be
precisely
the
same
if
it
said
they
wanted
to
get
off
saturday
for
conscientious
reason
except
in
that
instance,
it
would
let
all
seventh-day
adventists.
justice
hugo
l.
black
68-114.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
that
is
put
in
there
by
reason
of
the
federal
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
the
statute
to
which
i
called
attention
is
--
is
the
title
28
united
states
code,
2403
which
requires
that
any
actions
suit
or
proceedings
of
the
united
states
or
any
agency
of
it,
is
not
a
party
within
the
--
wherein
the
constitutionality
of
any
act
of
congress
affecting
the
public
interest
is
drawn
in
question,
the
court
shall
certify
such
fact
to
the
attorney
general
and
should
permit
the
attorney
general
to
intervene
in
the
presentation
of
evidence
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
it
should
be
construed
the
other
way,
do
you
know
what
would
be
the
effect
then
on
the
federal
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
