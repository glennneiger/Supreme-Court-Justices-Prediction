isn't
that
the
sense
in
which

usually
used,
religious
conviction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
--
you
don't
usually
say
in
the
statute
that
if
you
--
if
you
feel
that
it's
--
you're
in
jeopardy
of
your
health
that
it's
a
conscientious

all
of

work
six
days
a
week?
chief

in
this
--
in

credit
rating.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
of
the
employers
for
--
for
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
the
more
people
they
have
unemployed
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
more
they
have
to
pay,
is
that
what
you're
referring
to?

that's
experience
rate.
chief

man
people

suppose
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how

people
in
the
area?
chief
justice

chief

couldn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that

business?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
you
mean,
in
this
one
industry?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
there
are
other
industries
that
perhaps
that
she
could
--
she
could
be
employed
in
and
why
--
why
wouldn't
she
be
eligible
for
employment
there
and
if
there
wasn't
anything
open
for
her
there,
why
shouldn't
she
have
a
reasonable
time
to
obtain
employment
there.

justice
earl
warren

donnelly.
