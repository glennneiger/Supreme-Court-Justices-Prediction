mr.
william
d.
donnelly
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina,
probable
jurisdiction
was
noted
december
17,
1962.
the
question
presented
in
essence
is
whether
a
seventh-day
adventist
observing
the
saturday
sabbath
from
friday
evening
at
sundown
to
saturday
evening
at
sundown
maybe
required
to
work
on
saturday
under
penalty
of
loss
upon
employment
compensation.
the
basic
question
is
whether
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
first
amendment
guaranteeing
the
free
exercise
of
religion
is
violated
by
the
south
carolina
unemployment
compensation
act
as
here
construed
and
applied.
the
pertinent
facts
are
simple.
the
appellant,
age
57
had
been
employed
as
a
school
tender
for
about
approximately
35
years,
and
since
1938
steadily
in
the
plant
of
spartan
mills
at
spartanburg,
south
carolina.
from
world
war
ii,
its
saturday
work
had
been
on
a
voluntary
basis
and
appellant
was
required
to
work
only
five
days
a
week,
monday
through
friday.
she
worked
on
the
first
shift
from
7
a.m.
to
3
p.m.
on
august
6,
1957,
she
became
a
member
of
the
seventh-day
adventist
church.
the
religious
teaching
of
that
church
is
that
the
sabbath
for
the
worship
of
god
commanded
by
him
commences
at
sundown,
friday
evening
and
ends
at
sundown,
saturday
evening.
without
incident
after
her
joining
the
seventh-day
adventist
church
and
for
approximately
22
months,
she
continued
in
the
same
regular
employment
until
june
5,
1959,
when
the
employer
posted
notice
that
thereafter
work
on
saturday
would
be
mandatory
as
well.
after
the
notice
was
posted,
she
explained
to
her
employer
that
her
religion
would
not
permit
her
to
work
on
saturday.
no
relief
was
given
to
her
and
she
was
absent
from
work
for
six
successive
saturdays
and
was
then
discharged.
she
admittedly
applied
for
unemployment
compensation.
the
pertinent
sections
of
the
state
law
are
set
out
in
our
gray-covered
brief
at
pages
3
and
4.
this
statute
is
substantially
the
same
as
that
found
in
most
of
the
states.
section
68-113
(3)
requires
it
to
be
initially
eligible
for
compensation
benefits,
the
claimant
must
be
able
to
work
and
available
for
work.
the
claims
examiner
held
her
not
available
for
work
because
she
was
unwilling
to
work
on
saturday.
section
68-114
provides
that
even
though
initially
eligible
for
benefits,
the
claimant
maybe
disqualified
for
misconduct
conduct
--
connected
with
her
most
recent
work.
and
on
that
further
ground,
the
same
examiner
held
her
disqualified
for
five
weeks
because
of
her
unexcused
absences.
i
might
say
that
this
as
applied
in
this
case
means
simply
that
the
payment
of
the
benefits
which
can
total
to
22
weeks
or
deferred
was
deferred
for
five
weeks
and
the
examiner
did
not
purport
to
apply
a
forfeiture
of
the
five
weeks
of
pay
unemployment
benefits
which
might
have
been
imposed
in
a
case
that
he
felt
was
flagrant
enough.
it
appears
--
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
connected
with
her
work,
that’s
right,
your
honor.
it
appeared
that
the
appellant
had
applied
at
three
other
textile
mills
shortly
after
her
discharge,
but
found
that
they
were
on
a
six-day
basis.
the
record
shows
that
most
of
the
textile
plants
operate
on
a
six-day
basis,
but
this
record
also
shows
a
curious
case
of
growth
of
that
fraction
most.
the
referee
on
appeal
said
practically
all
of
the
textile
plants
operate
on
a
six-day
basis.
the
commission
said
all.
the
court
of
common
pleas
said
all,
and
when
it
got
to
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina,
we
having
taken
the
specific
exemption
to
that
finding
because
of
the
record
showing
most,
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
commission
had
found
all
operate
on
a
six-day
basis.
i
call
the
attention
of
that
because
it
is
significant
in
the
light
of
the
other
circumstances
of
this
case.
in
any
event,
the
applicant
was
on
an
apparently
very
little
wage
because
the
record
shows
that
her
benefits,
if
paid,
would
have
been
limited
to
$26
per
week.
and
under
the
south
carolina
law,
this
is
usually
taken
to
approximate
half
of
the
average
weekly
wage.
she
stated
in
the
hearing
before
the
referee
that
she
was
willing
to
work
and
able
to
work,
in
any
mill
or
in
any
other
industry
so
long
as
the
job
was
a
decent
job,
and
so
long
as
it
did
not
require
her
to
work
on
her
sabbath.
the
evidence
is
also
un-contradicted
in
this
record
that
of
the
150
members
of
the
seventh-day
adventist
church
in
spartanburg,
all
are
gainfully
employed
and
none
experience
any
particular
difficulty
in
obtaining
jobs.
we
think
the
record
is
clear
that
the
appellant
did
not
remove
herself
from
the
labor
market
in
that
area
by
her
refusal
to
work
on
the
sabbath.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
none
whatsoever,
your
honor
as
i
understand
it.
the
claim
examiner's
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
referee
by
the
state
unemployment
compensation
commission
and
by
the
common
pleas
court
of
spartanburg
county.
the
state
supreme
court
apparently
conceded
that
“available
for
work”
the
classic
phrase
means
available
for
suitable
work.
in
1955,
the
law
of
south
carolina
had
been
amended
to
provide
specifically
in
determining
whether
or
not
any
work
is
suitable
for
an
individual,
the
commission
shall
consider
the
degree
of
risk
involved
to
his
health,
safety,
and
morals.
the
court,
however,
held
that
this
amendment
merely
referred
to
work,
the
character
of
which
would
be
morally
objectionable
to
any
employee,
and
therefore,
excluded
the
contention
there
made
by
the
appellant
that
consideration
and
application
of
that
amendment
would
require
recognition
that
to
require
her
to
work
on
saturday
would
be
violative
and
--
of
her
religion
and
carry
with
it
a
grave
threat
to
her
morals
and
by
reason
of
that
fact
would
exonerate
her
from
this
requirement.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
that
appears
in
the
middle
of
page
4
of
my
gray
brief,
and
it
quotes,
“in
determining
whether
or
not
any
work
is
suitable
for
an
individual,
the
commission
shall
consider
the
degree
of
risk
involved
to
his
health,
safety
and
morals.”
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
oh
no,
no,
no,
that
is
a
--
this
is
a
negative
statement.
you're
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
that's
right.
there
is
no
impairment
of
that
rule
at
all.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
i
think
that's
carried
through
in
the
general
thinking
in
the
application
of
this
line,
sir.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
no,
they
did
not
consider
as
such.
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
decisions
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
tary
against
board
of
review
and
in
re
miller
in
243,
north
carolina,
later
of
which
incidentally
did
involved
mill
work
where
it
held
not
applicable
by
the
state
of
--
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
n
essence,
the
court
concluded,
“the
purpose
of
the
available
for
work
test
is
to
determine
whether
the
claimant
is
actually
and
currently
attached
to
the
labor
market.
that
is
to
say
whether
or
not
she
was
offering
a
service
for
which
there
was
a
demand
and
which
was
being
supplied
in
that
area,
whether
or
not,
that
there
was
a
job
open
that
would
require
her
services
at
that
time
because
of
course,
the
law
contemplates
the
compensation
for
those
who
are
unemployed.”
curiously,
the
court
went
on
to
say,
however,
that
the
test
in
determining
whether
or
not
she's
attached
to
the
labor
market
is
unrestricted
availability.
later
on
in
opinion
they
said,
but
this
doesn't
mean
on
sunday,
but
i'll
come
to
that
later.
curiously,
the
court
made
no
further
reference
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
market
for
the
appellant
services.
the
--
it
does
not
refer
to
the
fact
that
all
other
seventh-day
adventists
were
able
to
obtain
positions
without
difficulty
and
were
all
gainfully
employed
and
it
ignores
that
point
completely
in
the
opinion.
the
state
court,
instead,
held
that
by
adhering
to
the
seventh-day
adventist
decree,
the
appellant
had
rendered
herself
unable
or
unwilling
to
work
in
her
usual
trade
or
occupation
for
the
usual
and
customary
number
of
days
or
hours
and
had
restricted
her
willingness
to
work
to
periods
that
fit
her
own
personal
circumstances.
the
resort
to
both
those
phrases
apparently
was
occasioned
by
the
fact
that
they
had
been
used
in
other
circumstances
by
other
state
courts
in
rejecting
claims
to
compensation.
because
of
this,
the
court
concluded
that
she
was
not
available
for
work.
as
to
the
disqualification
to
which
mr.
justice
goldberg
referred,
they
quite
made
a
minor
shift
and
said
that
she
was
disqualified
not
for
misconduct
connected
with
her
work
but
failure
to
accept
without
good
cause,
available
suitable
work
offered
to
her
by
her
employer,
referring
to
the
fact
that
the
employer
was
quite
willing
to
keep
her
on
if
she
were
willing
to
work
on
saturdays.
as
to
the
constitutional
right
to
the
free
exercise
of
religion,
the
court
held
that
the
law
had
placed
no
restriction
of
right
to
observe
her
religious
beliefs
in
accordance
with
her
own
conscience.
she
was
completely
free
to
do
as
she
pleased
in
other
words.
the
only
trouble
was,
she
would
lose
the
right
to
the
compensation
benefits.
the
dissent
noted,
as
the
record
clearly
shows,
that
she
had
made
no
change
in
the
days
or
hours
of
her
usual
work
and
that
her
loss
of
the
job
was
occasioned
by
the
change
of
the
employer
in
shifting
over
to
the
six-day
week.
of
course,
if
we
can
refer
back
to
what
happened
22
months
before
and
say
that
she
changed
her
religion,
then
yes,
indirectly
and
remotely,
her
change
was
occasioned
for
her
being
discharged.
now,
free
exercise
of
religion,
as
we
conceive
it,
means
exercise
free
of
sanctions
or
penalties
that
influence
or
compel
the
person
to
profess
her
belief
or
disbelief
in
any
religion,
or
to
do
an
act
repugnant
to
his
religion.
relying
on
the
language
of
mr.
justice
jackson
in
the
barnett
case,
we
first
start
with
the
proposition
here
that
in
requiring
this
applicant
to
express
a
willingness
to
work
on
saturday,
she
was
being
required
to
express
and
profess
an
attitude
of
mind
in
conflict
with
her
religious
beliefs
sincerely
held.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
well,
i
think
that
the
--
to
say
that
that's
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
is
to
give
undue
weight
to
the
state
--
statement
that
there
is
a
wall
of
separation
between
church
and
state.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
i
--
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
that
says
that
to
give
effect
to
any
person's
religious
belief
is
to
--
and
permit
that
person
to
exercise
his
religious
belief
is
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
and
the
everson
--
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
and
the
everson
case
also
said,
“neither
the
state
nor
the
federal
government
can
force
or
influence
a
person
to
go
to
or
to
remain
away
from
church
against
his
will
or
force
him
to
profess
a
belief
or
disbelief
in
any
religion.”
now,
i
submit
that
here
--
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
well,
they're
both
parts
of
the
same
constitution.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
of
the
same
--
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
--
amendment
and
of
the
same
constitution
under
which
we
operate
--
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
--
that
is
correct.
this
was
reiterated
in
the
more
recent
decision
in
the
braunfeld
case.
if
the
purpose
or
effect
of
the
law
is
to
impede
the
observance
of
one
or
all
religions
or
as
to
discriminate
invidiously
between
religions,
that
law
is
constitutionally
invalid
even
though
the
burden
maybe
characterized
as
being
only
indirect.
and
of
course,
if
your
argument
or
your
point
is
valid,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
submit
that
to
recognize
any
right
of
religious
freedom
in
any
particular
individual,
in
any
particular
case,
first,
is
not
in
derogation
of
the
presumed
right
of
other
individuals
having
other
religions
to
exercise
that
same
right
free
of
sanction
or
trammel.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
this
is
correct.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
i
submit
that
it
aids
no
religion
in
permitting
an
individual
to
practice
her
or
his
religion.
this
is
the
basic
freedom.
this
is
the
dignity
of
the
individual
on
which
i
think
the
first
amendment
was
based
and
that
in
both
the
establishment
clause
as
barring
the
right
to
permit
the
exercise
of
religion
by
the
individual
is
an
untoward
extension
of
that
clause.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
now,
continuing,
this
court
has
of
course
recognized
that
in
the
welfare
state,
the
sanctions
that
maybe
imposed
by
withholding
the
numerous
so-called
privileges
of
compensation
for
unemployment
and
public
housing
and
in
most
recently
in
the
spicer
case,
the
tax
exemption
for
veterans
tantamount
to
sanctions
equivalent
to
a
penalty
and
i
believe,
it
equate
--
with
those,
equate
with
a
prohibition
of
law.
now
the
appellee
relies
chiefly
as
i
understand
your
argument
upon
the
contention
that
in
the
braunfeld
case,
the
sunday
law
cases,
this
question
was
already
decided
that
this
is
an
indirect
burden
and
falls
with
it.
they
lack
the
result
in
that
case.
i
still
lack
the
language
in
the
braunfeld
case
because
in
this
case,
it
cannot
rightly
be
asserted
that
there
is
any
indirect
pressure
because
there,
in
distinguishing
the
flag
salute
case,
this
court
pointed
out
the
statute
before
us
does
not
make
criminal,
the
holding
of
any
religious
belief
or
opinion
nor
does
it
force
anyone
to
embrace
any
religious
belief
or
to
say
or
believe
anything
in
conflict
with
these
religious
tenants.
or
as
mr.
justice
brennan
considered
in
his
dissent,
the
distinction
was
based
on
the
fact
the
laws
do
not
say
that
appellants
must
work
on
saturday.
now
here,
if
we
concede
that
the
imposition
of
a
criminal
penalty
or
a
fine
as
in
the
sunday
law
cases
is
equivalent
to
or
equaled
by
the
penalty
imposed
by
the
withholding
of
the
unemployment
benefit,
then
i
submit
that
here,
we
have
a
direct
penalty
and
the
direct
burden
because
the
individual
is
left
with
no
intermediate
choice
such
as
it
was
brought
in
the
sunday
law
cases.
here
he
has
only
two
choices,
two
alternatives.
he
works
on
saturday,
he
expresses
a
willingness
to
work
on
saturday
or
he
sacrifices
his
right
to
compensation,
and
the
court
of
south
carolina
suggests
no
alternative.
this
court
further
in
the
braunfeld
case
says
--
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor,
and
i
think
there's
something
in
this
record
and
the
appellee
nurtures
it
in
a
certain
extent
of
the
idea
that
this
is
a
mill
town
but
spartanburg
as
this
court
may
traditionally
notice
has
a
population
of
47,000
and
it
has
a
surrounding
county
that
is
build
up
in
a
total
area
or
the
immediate
surroundings
are
probably
approximately
150,000,
so
that
we're
not
dealing
with
the
one
industry
town.
this
court
also
recognized
in
the
braunfeld
case,
if
the
state
regulates
--
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
pardon
me.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
this
court
also
said
that
if
the
state
regulates
conduct
by
enacting
a
general
law
within
its
power,
the
purpose
and
effect
of
which
is
to
advance
the
state's
secular
goals,
the
statute
is
valid
despite
its
indirect
burden
on
religious
observance
unless
the
state
may
accomplish
its
purpose
by
means
which
do
not
impose
such
a
burden.
even
--
this
is
a
negative
way
of
stating
the
shelton
against
tucker
rule
even
though
the
government's
purpose
would
be
legitimate
and
stifled,
that
purpose
cannot
be
pursued
by
means
of
broadly
stifled
fundamental
personal
liberties
when
the
end
could
be
more
narrowly
achieved.
the
breadth
of
legislative
abridgment
must
be
viewed
in
the
light
of
less
drastic
means
for
achieving
the
basic
purpose.
in
this
case,
the
only
suggestion
made
by
the
appellee
to
justify
this
rigid
rule
that
excludes
consideration
is
the
possible
of
fraudulent
--
possibility
of
fraudulent
representation
that
the
individual
entertains
these
particular
beliefs.
the
answer
to
that
is
two-fold.
in
a
number
of
the
cases
including
the
schneider
case,
this
court
has
pointed
out
that
there
are
laws
against
fraud
that
can
be
enforced.
secondly,
in
our
appendix,
we
have
about
30
states'
administrative
decisions,
but
most
of
which
have
recognized
this
right
and
none
of
which,
so
far
as
i
can
recall,
referred
to
any
difficulty
in
ascertaining
whether
the
person
was
fraudulent
or
was
sincere.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
practically,
all
of
these
laws
provide
for
a
hearing
before
a
referee
at
which
i
believe
there's
no
limitation
on
what
can
be
done
into
it.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
yes.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
i
may
endeavor
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
are
raised
by
the
court.
as
i
recall,
the
only
provision
in
the
federal
statute
setting
standards
that
would
be
pertinent
here
was
the
one
which
i
believe
is
embodied
and
followed
in
section
68-114
(3)
(c).
this
is
not
set
out
in
our
briefs,
but
this
is
in
the
state
statute,
and
it
reads,
“not
with…”
--
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
68-114
(3)
(c).
i
believe
this
conforms
--
was
put
in
to
conform
to
the
federal
requirement.
“notwithstanding
any
other
provisions
of
this
title,
no
work
shall
be
deemed
suitable
and
benefit
shall
not
be
denied
under
this
title
to
any
otherwise
eligible
individual
for
refusing
to
accept
new
work
under
any
of
the
following
conditions.
(1)
if
the
position
offered
is
vacant
due
directly
to
strike,
blackout,
or
other
labor
dispute.
(2)
if
the
wages,
hours,
or
other
conditions
of
the
work
offered
are
substantially
less
favorable
to
the
individual,
then
those
prevailing
for
similar
work
in
the
locality,
or
(3),
if
as
a
condition
of
being
employed,
the
individual
would
be
required
to
join
a
company
union
or
to
resign
from
or
refrain
from
joining
any
bona
fide
labor
organization.”
i
happen
to
know
about
this
section,
your
honor
because
i
thought
it
was
somewhat
ironical,
that
the
individual
could
not
be
deemed
to
be
offered
suitable
work
if
it
required
him
to
resign
from
a
union,
but
under
the
interpretation
of
the
south
carolina
court,
he
is
offered
suitable
work
though
his
work
would
require
him
to
work
on
a
saturday
and
in
effect
to
resign
from
his
church.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
i
believe
it
will
found
that
the
federal
statute
requires
that
those
provisions
be
in
the
state
statute
and
if
the
state
statute
does
not
contain
those
provisions,
it
will
be
deemed
not
to
comply
with
the
exemption
granted
in
the
federal
statute.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
i'm
familiar
with
the
statute,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
it
has
application
for
here,
in
this
case.
for
example,
a
number
of
states
--
i've
cited
them
in
the
brief,
three
of
them,
at
least
have
held
that
their
statute
does
not
require
the
seventh-day
adventist
to
work
on
saturday
and
there
is
not
--
have
been
deemed
to
be
any
conflict
in
that
construction
with
the
federal
statute.
so
the
federal
statute
still
remains
in
full
force
and
effect
unaffected
by
the
construction
which
we
suggest
is
necessary
to
comply
with
the
constitution.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
well
i
think
--
i
think
that
the
federal
statute
would
be
unaffected
if
this
statute
were
construed
to
be
valid.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
i
still
--
i
still
do
not
believe
that
the
federal
statute
would
be
affected.
mr.
william
d.
donnelly
there's
only
one
other
point
that
i
wanted
to
mention.
the
peculiar
sunday
law
that
was
a
subject
of
the
discussion
earlier
is
referred
to
at
record
48
by
the
court
as
the
reason
for
accepting
the
requirement
of
working
on
sunday.
it's
significant
that
they
did
not
rely
on
the
general
sunday
law
prohibiting
work
on
sunday
by
an
individual
and
i
speculate,
but
i
think
the
reference
to
the
statute
will
show
that
this
was
done
because
within
a
month,
before
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina,
the
general
sunday
law
prohibition
had
been
amended
radically
to
provide
that
many
types
of
work
were
permissible
on
sunday
under
the
impact
of
the
decision
in
the
sunday
law
cases
and
a
threat
that
the
old
statute
was
going
to
be
enforced
very
rigidly.
thank
you,
your
honor.
