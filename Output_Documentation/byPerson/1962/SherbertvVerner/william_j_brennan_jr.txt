well,
how
would
this
operate,
mr.
attorney
general,
if
this
petitioner
were
employed
in
an
industry
which
had
one
of
the
national
emergency
exceptions?
i
gather
if
she
refused
to
work
on
saturday,
she'd
be
disqualified,
but
if
someone
along
side
of
her
refused
to
work
on
sunday
that
someone
would
not
be
disqualified
for
it.
justice

now,
well
mr.
attorney
general,
isn't
there
--
isn't
there
federal
supervision
of
the
state
administration
of
the
unemployment
compensation
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
rather
a
comprehensive
federal
supervision,
is
there
none?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
that.
what
i
meant
--
isn't
there
a
federal
supervision
of
the
state
administration?
