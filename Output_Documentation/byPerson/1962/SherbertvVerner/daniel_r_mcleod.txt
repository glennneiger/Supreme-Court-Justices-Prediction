mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
--
and
members
of
the
court.
i
may
note
initially
that
in
response
to
the
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there's
no
question
made
with
respect
to
the
bona
fides
of
the
conviction
of
the
appellant
in
this
matter.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
exactly,
no
question
about
that,
your
honor.
if
the
court
please,
the
primary
purpose,
of
course,
unemployment
compensation
law
is
to
take
care
of
the
effects
of
unemployment
that
is
brought
about
not
by
the
voluntary
action
of
the
employee,
but
by
the
involuntary
action
of
the
employee.
the
unemployment
laws
recognize
that
there
would
be
dislocation
industrially
and
economically
resulting
in
involuntary
unemployment.
the
line
that
has
been
drawn
by
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
and
by,
i
think
a
majority
of
the
other
states,
with
respect
to
questions
similar
to
that
presented
here
is
this,
that
if
the
unemployment
is
brought
about
as
a
result
of
economic
or
industrial
dislocation,
then
it
is
compensable,
but
it
is
brought
about
by
something
that
is
personal
to
the
employee.
some
personal
action
that
does
not
come
within
the
scope
of
the
statute
or
the
administrative
construction
of
the
statute,
then
it
is
not
compensable.
that
can
be
illustrated
by
a
number
of
cases,
one
of
which
has
been
before
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
for
instance
a
workman
or
a
worker
having
to
care
for
children,
having
to
care
for
sick
husband,
a
very
laudable
purpose
that
one
requires
that
she
not
be
at
her
job,
but
nevertheless
in
circumstances
such
as
that,
compensation
is
denied.
that
has
been
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
and
by
a
number
of
all
state
courts.
cases
involving
the
cessation
of
work
by
a
wife
when
her
husband
has
been
transferred
away
from
the
site
of
her
employment;
she
may
form
religious
or
other
reasons
to
be
compelled
to
be
by
the
side
of
her
husband
but
nevertheless
that
is
not
held
to
be
a
suitable
ground
for
ceasing
work
and
in
that
case,
unemployment
benefits
are
withheld.
an
exception
is
made
to
some
extent
administratively
in
south
carolina
with
respect
to
cessation
of
work
by
reason
of
pregnancy
up
through
a
certain
stage
of
the
pregnancy
period
benefits
are
payable,
beyond
that,
there
are
none.

may
interrupt
the

mr.
justice,
this
is
not
a

first
place
of
the
unemployment
compensation
law.

law.
mr.
daniel

mcleod
an
entirely
different
title.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
they're
unrelated
from
that
standpoint.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
in
certain
industries.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
in
certain
circumstances,
national
emergency
and
so
forth.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
would
think
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
the
--
the
--
that's
--
this
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
it
does,
mr.
justice,
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
my
answer
to
that
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
my
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice,
is
this.
that
that
is
an
unusual
limited
circumstances.
it's
applicable
only
to
textile
employment
and
applicable
only
to
mercantile
establishments,
i
believe,
is
the
other.
a
limited
field
of
industrial
activity
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
in
the
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
my
answer
to
that
is
this.
sunday
is
universally
accepted
under
the
common
statute
as
a
day
of
rest.
we
have
the
same
beacon
statute.
this
is
an
exemption
from
that
old
religion
statute
and
that
is
i
say,
is
a
limited
field,
limited
industrially
and
limited
also
to
those
who
have
national
defense
contracts.
moreover,
the
status
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
in
those
particular
industries
which
allow
the
breaching
of
the
sunday
rest
day,
i
feel
that
the
distinction
is
this,
that
the
sunday
is
a
day
of
rest
day,
stand
in
a
category
by
themselves,
and
that
if
there's
an
exemption
as
was
in
the
massachusetts
statute
in
a
very
detailed
manner,
so
much
so
that
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
rendered
the
statute
in
veritable
hodge-podge.
exemptions
from
the
sunday
closing
laws
are
not
unusual,
and
as
i
see
it,
they
are
tacitly
recognized
as
valid
by
this
court.
this
is
one
of
those
exemptions.
and
therefore,
to
say
that
it
invidiously
discriminates
against
these
members
of
this
faith
who
won't
work
on
saturday
and
they're
thereby
penalized
by
being
withheld
from
unemployment
benefits.
to
say
that
is
to
say
also
that
the
exemption
granted
for
the
sunday
closing
statute
must
be
granted
in
all
other
fields:
unemployment
benefits,
public
employment,
appearances
in
court.
if
one
exemption
would
stand
there
then
the
exemption
would
necessarily
by
that
process
of
reasoning
be
applicable
in
every
other
field
of
activity
in
the
state.
and
therefore,
i
feel
that
there
is
no
invidious
discrimination.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
true.
i
think
that
would
be
--
that
point
has
never
come
up.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
this
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
it
does.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
true
initially.
now
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
conscientious,
now
i
wanted
to
make
this
point
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
think
it
means
just
this.
i
think
it
means
the
terms
that
are
used
are
almost
synonymous
and
the
point
i
was
just
about
to
make
a
moment
ago
and
that
is
this
that
normally
a
seven-day
week
is
something
that
we
don't
like.
but
for
defense
purposes,
the
state
permits
a
seven-day
working
week
and
that
therefore,
when
they
use
the
words
conscientiously
and
physically
opposed
to
it
then
that
meant
then
in
a
synonymous
sense
and
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to
be
based
upon
some
religious
belief
as
to
not
being
willing
to
work
on
sunday
or
unwilling
to
work
on
sunday.
it
might
be
based
on
a
conscientious
objection
to
work
seven
days
a
week
for
physical
reasons
or
it
could
be
conceivably
be
based
upon
religious
grounds.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
oh
yes,
correct.
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
exactly.
i
think,
your
honor,
yes.
that
is
a
normal
phraseology
used,
a
normal
--
a
normal
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
--
attitude
that
would
be
taken.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
construe
those
to
mean
as
i
say,
i
think
they're
used
interchangeably
in
the
same
sense.
it
may
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
well,
i
would
--
maybe.
i
feel
that
the
--
and
maybe
substituted
in
the
place
[inaudible]
on
that.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
normally
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
should
think
it
would.
my
basic
position
in
this
matter
is
this
that
this
is
a
statute,
this
is
an
administrative
policy
that
is
secular
in
aim
and
object
and
purpose
and
secular
in
its
goal.
and
that
if
there
is
any
resulting
burden
upon
any
exercise
of
religion
as
claimed
by
this
appellant,
that
is
an
indirect
burden
which
must
be
borne
and
which
does
--
it
is
not
constitutionally
objectionable.
the
object
of
the
unemployment
compensation
law
is
not
merely
to
compensate
those
who
are
not
working.
another
object
and
probably
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
it's
collected
from
both,
mr.
justice
black.
there
is
a
three
per
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
there
is
a
3%
that's
been
increased
in
recent
weeks
or
months
but
slightly
more
than
that,
the
federal
tax
is
laid
upon
the
employer
for
the
purpose
of
creating
a
fund.
now
the
federal
government
credits
the
employer
up
to
the
amount
of
two
and
seven
tenth
percent
of
that
tax
if
they
pay
it
in
to
distinct
and
it
is
collected
by
the
state
of
south
carolina,
so
that
three-tenths
of
1%
is
federal,
2.7%
is
state.
the
3%
has
been
increased
to
some
small
extent
in
recent
months.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
none
that
i'm
aware
that
they
touch
on
this
matter
here.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
well
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i'm
not
aware
--
i
am
not
aware
of
any
of
the
--
there
are
a
number
of
requirements
that,
of
course,
must
meet
such
as
creating
unemployment
service,
and
maintaining
certain
standards
and
must
have
a
merit
system
for
employees,
certain
salaries
must
be
met,
and
things
of
that
nature,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
any
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
those
particular
items
and
i
presume
that
there
would
be
means
of
withdrawing
any
federal
participation
in
the
scheme
of
unemployment.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
my
understanding
and
i'm
not
quite
confident
to
answer
it
--
to
the
justice's
question
--
is
that
the
manner
in
which
--
matters
such
as
this
would
be
determined,
will
be
at
the
state
level
and
that
will
be
accepted
by
the
state
--
by
the
federal
government.
i
say
that
for
this
reason
because
as
counsel
has
pointed
out
a
moment
ago,
many
states
provide
for
an
exemption
exactly
as
this
appellant
acted
for
and
some
do
not.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
think
whenever
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
no.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
on
this
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
on
this
phase,
i
can
see
none.
i
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
from
an
accounting
standpoint,
from
the
establishment
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
it's
primarily
a
state
function
as
i
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
undoubtedly.
i'm
certain
there
is.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
shouldn't
--
perhaps
so.
i
have
no
--
it
not
occurred
to
me.
i
have
no
reason
for
believing
that
they
would
care
whether
this
matter
should
be
decided
one
way
or
the
other.
now,
i
say
that
additionally
for
this
reason,
the
funds
and
taxes
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
from
the
amount
that's
paid
by
the
employer,
the
2.7%
for
which
the
federal
government
credits,
all
of
the
benefits,
the
unemployment
benefits
such
as
these
later
received,
all
of
those
are
paid
from
that
2.7%
fund.
therefore,
it's
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
think
that's
true
and
i
have
information
that
the
benefits
come
from
that
point
that's
created
by
the
employer.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
one
point
that
i
think
is
of
vital
significance
is
the
thing
that
not
only
that
we
think
benefits
were
that
--
the
worker
is
unemployed,
but
the
statute
requires
that
employment
be
secured
for
these
unemployed
as
far
as
possible
so
that
they
maybe
placed
back
in
the
working
force.
the
textile
industry
in
my
state
is
the
largest
single
employer.
spartanburg
got
--
where
this
case
originated
is
the
largest
textile
manufacturing
plant
area
in
south
carolina,
employing
about
14%
of
all
the
textile
labor
market.
the
court
will
note
that
the
five
--
that
the
reference
in
the
transcript
of
record
to
the
fact
that
this
employee,
since
1900
and
since
the
end
of
the
world
war
ii
had
worked
on
saturday
for
a
period
of
about
five
years
prior
to
the
time
this
case
arose,
but
that
was
voluntarily
done
and
permitted
by
the
employer.
the
employer
was
operating
on
a
six-day
schedule
and
the
mills
are
operating
on
six-day
schedules
now
with
three
day
--
three
shifts
each.
when
conditions
worsen,
the
work
force
is
not
reduced
but
first
the
days
are
shortened
so
that
you
may
have
three
days
per
week,
but
all
of
three
shifts
each.
i
am
pointing
that
out
to
emphasize
that
economic
conditions
in
the
textile
industry
where
this
appellant
worked
for
35
years
are
good
and
that
employment
is
available,
but
that
--
this
employee
has
restricted
her
availability
for
employment.
number
one,
by
refusing
to
work
because
of
her
religious
beliefs
on
saturday
but
it
maybe
noted
incidentally
that
she
is
a
first
shift
employee.
that's
the
shift
that
normally
goes
to
the
senior
employees.
being
a
first
shift
employee,
she
is
available
for
work
on
five
days
of
the
week.
but
on
the
second
shift,
and
on
the
third
shift,
those
shifts
overlapping
sundown
friday
until
sundown
saturday,
on
those
two
shifts,
she
will
only
be
available
four
days
per
week.
now
that's
given
some
recognition
by
the
administrative
agency
in
the
--
in
the
state,
but
it
restricts
her
appeal
of
employment
so
that
we
are
now
attempting
to
place
not
a
textile
worker,
but
a
seventh-day
adventist
textile
worker.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
and
i'm
unable
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i'm
asking
you
this
question
for
this
reason.
if
the
statute
would
require
before
we
pass
on
a
case
which
raises
constitutional
validity
of
a
federal
statute,
the
department
of
justice
must
be
noted
by
and
be
present.
and
could
we
decide
this
constitutionality
of
this
case
so
as
to
hold
that
it's
unconstitutional,
that
that
thereby
to
a
certain
extent
holding
that
the
federal
statute
is
unconstitutional?
would
there
have
an
effect
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
mr.
justice
black,
i
can't
--
i
have
not
given
thought
to
that
thing
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
--
i'm
unable
to
state.
i
do
not
feel
there
would
be
any
federal
involvement
in
here.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
presume
so.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
in
spartanburg
area,
it
is
true,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
all
of
them,
all
of
them
do.
the
counsel
for
--
it
was
--
it
was
associated
with
the
general
counsel
for
the
mill's
employer
involved
in
this
case
and
he's
closely
associated
with
mill
and
he
so
informed
me.
the
phrase
“suitable
for
work”
is
one
that
has
been
referred
to
mr.
justice
goldberg
a
moment
ago,
noted
almost
the
--
all
of
the
matter,
the
criteria
that
is
set
forth
to
determine
what
suitable
for
work
means
in
the
statute.
it
is
not
set
forth
in
its
complete
detail
in
the
transcript
nor
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
health,
safety,
and
morals
of
the
person
must
be
considered
in
determining
whether
the
work
is
suitable
--
other
criteria
coming
--
a
physical
fitness
in
the
work,
the
prior
training,
the
prior
experience,
the
prior
earnings,
and
length
of
employment,
the
prospects
for
local
work
in
the
customary
occupation
of
that
employee,
the
distance
of
that
available
work
from
the
employee's
home,
all
of
those,
may
it
please
the
court,
are
secular
criteria
and
none
of
them
has
any
religious
significance
whatsoever.
i
feel
that
it's
a
reasonable
deduction
to
make
when
i
say
that
if
this
appellant
is
entitled
to
unemployment
benefits
and
still
refused
to
take
work
in
her
customary
occupation
on
saturday
by
the
same
token,
the
employer
would
be
required
to
compensate
her
for
any
number
of
days
that
they
might
want
to
work
depending
upon
their
particular
religious
faith
and
with
300
or
more
various
religious
faiths
in
the
country
and
to
employers,
will
be
placed
in
an
intolerable
--
intolerable
situation.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
feel
that
if
one
person's
faith
may
require
him
to
work
on
three
days
of
the
week,
for
instance,
the
muslims
as
i
understand
it,
requires
a
religious
holiday
on
friday.
it's
conceivable
that
a
person's
religious
faith
might
require
him
to
work
on
three
days
of
the
week.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
then
we
must
find
somebody
--
some
person
employment
in
an
industry
that
works
three
days
per
week.
the
employer
is
faced
in
this
position.
that's
why
i
say
placed
in
a
rather
intolerable
position.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
true,
but
the
employer
is
involved
in
this.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
the
employer
is
one
who
creates
the
fund
from
which
these
benefits
are
paid.
the
employer
is
faced
with
the
proposition
of
hiring
the
appellant.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
well,
the
appellant
in
this
case
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
--
was
working
there.
she
was
discharged
because
she
would
not
work
the
full
six
days
work
that
was
available
for
her.
now
the
only
alternative
the
employer
has
is
to
retain
her
on
a
five-day
basis
or
else,
they
--
the
unemployment
benefits
to
that
which
come
from
upon
that
he
himself
has
created
by
his
own
taxes.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
have
what?
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
credit
rating.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes
sir.
that's
the
point
i
want
to
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
the
experience
rate.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
was
attempting
to
show
that
there's
an
overriding
state
interest
in
this
matter,
and
that
we
have
a
balanced
secular
statute.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
employees
--
well,
it's
a
negative
conclusion.
it's
not
shown
that
they
were
not
working.
there
is
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
there's
one
of
them
i
believe
who
is
not
employed,
but
the
record
does
not
show
that
this
employee,
this
appellant,
a
member
of
that
faith,
it's
unanimously
employed
there
--
wholesale
employed
there
has
been
able
to
secure
employment
just
as
in
other
members
of
their
faith.
there's
no
evidence
she's
applied
to
employment
that
is
available
to
a
member
of
the
seventh-day
adventist
church.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
she
has
applied
in
the
other
remaining
plants
in
the
spartanburg
area,
and
all
of
them
are
working
on
a
six-day
schedule.
she
declined
the
employment.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
true.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
the
statute
further
requires
except
suitable
work
when
offered,
five
instances
of
this
type
of
work
were
offered
to
her,
which
she
had
declined.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
of
the
area?
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
have
those
figures.
14%
of
all
of
the
textile
workers
in
the
state
are
employed
in
the
area,
but
i
do
not
have
the
total.
there
are
119,000
persons
employed
in
the
textile
industry
in
the
state.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
18
--
i
do
not
have
those
figures,
not
in
all
--
in
all
respects.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
do
have
the
spartanburg
area
textile
employment.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
know
it
was
18,000.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
people,
that's
right
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
150,000
in
the
metropolitan
area.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
should
think
so.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
she
wouldn't
be,
if
she
was
--
if
it
was
available
and
if
it's
a
work
which
she
can
undertake,
but
the
point
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
work
is
available
there.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
true.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
well,
i
should
think
she
should.
now
the
record
shows
no
evidence
on
her
point
and
the
burden
is
on
her,
by
the
general
trend
of
the
business
--
of
the
decision.
the
record
shows
no
activity
on
her
part
except
in
applying
to
the
remaining
textile
mills
in
the
spartanburg
area.
no
effort
to
apply
to
the
--
any
seventh-day
adventist
industry
or
business.
no
effort
to
apply
anywhere
else.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
the
disqualification
came
after
she
had
declined.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
would
say
that
it
wouldn't
--
a
general
statute
of
that
nature.
i
state
my
personal
feeling
on
the
thing
that
i
don't
think
that
type
of
statute
ought
to
be
enacted
because
i
think
it
is
attempting
to
establish
in
a
regulation,
a
police
regulation,
if
you
please,
an
exemption
that's
framed
in
terms
of
religious
belief
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
--
and
it
ought
not
to
be
done
in
the
[inaudible]
on
the
establishment
clause
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
do
not,
for
this
reason,
that
that,
as
i
say,
he
stands
in
a
completely
different
category
because
it
is
a
day
of
rest
statute.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes.
with
this
exemption,
i
reiterate
repetitious
perhaps,
but
this
is
a
limited
field,
a
limited
economy,
one
that
was
called
upon
by
the
war
department
in
time
of
emergency
to
a
very
large
extent,
perhaps
larger
than
or
more
so
than
any
other
industry
and
this
exemption
was
made
to
give
relief
in
the
seven-day
work
period
and
not
for
any
religious
purpose.
