justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
dispute
at
all
between
the
litigants
here
as
to
the
good
faith
of
her
religious
beliefs?
justice
potter
stewart
the
difficulty
with
your
argument
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
mr.
donnelly
is
that
if
the
state
had
done
anything
other
than
what
it
did
in
this
case,
it
would
have
violated
the
establishment
clause
because
it
would
have
favored
one
religion.
justice
potter
stewart
i
wholeheartedly
agree
with
you
but
i'm
talking
about
the
establishment
clause
that
has
been
construed
by
this
court.
justice
potter
stewart
the
everson
--
the
everson
case
says
that
any
state
which
favors
one
religion
violates
the
establishment
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
the
act
--
the
--
the
--
if
the
state
took
the
action
which
you
say
should
have
taken
here
would
have
favored
the
seventh-day
adventist
and
therefore
would
have
violated
the
establishment
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
that's
--
that's
the
--
that
touches
only
free
exercise
clause
of
which
you
are
relying
on.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
they're
not.
they're
two
different
clauses.
justice
potter
stewart
they're
both
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
the
state
must
not
aid
all
religions
or
--
and
must
not
aid
any
one
religion
under
the
establishment
clause
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
construed
by
this
court.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
agree
with
you
but
i'm
just
suggesting
that
these
statutes
are
vague.
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
where
these
other
--
what
is
it,
a
150
members
of
the
jehovah's
witnesses
based
in
spartanburg,
where
they
--
where
they
employed?
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
i
meant
the
seventh-day
adventist.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
no
question
either
that
her
bona
fide
religious
belief
does
require
her
to
observe
the
sabbath
on
saturday.
justice
potter
stewart
but
says
conscientious
or
physical
objections
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
whatever
that
might
be,
whatever
that
means
--
physical
objection.
justice
potter
stewart
attitudes
too
â€“-
justice
potter
stewart
use
all
the
alternative
objections.
it
doesn't
say
conscientious
i.e.
physical
objection.
it's
says
conscientious
or
physical
objection.
justice
potter
stewart
it
--
they
do
not
(voice
overlap)
in
the
dictionary?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
and
the
bar
not
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
that
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
now
you're
talking
about
a
private
employer,
right?
so
this
case
isn't
involved
with
that.
this
case
is
involved
with
the
action
of
the
state
of
south
carolina.
justice
potter
stewart
how?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
hiring
anybody.
justice
potter
stewart
hiring
its
employees.
justice
potter
stewart
i
still
don't
follow
that.
what
this
case
involves
is
the
right
of
this
appellant
in
unemployment
compensation
from
the
state
of
south
carolina.
that's
what's
involved
here,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
now
an
employer,
i
suppose,
a
private
employer
in
a
private
factory,
at
least
we
may
hypothesize,
that
he's
free
to
hire
or
not
hire
anybody
he
wants
for
any
reason
he
wants,
the
absence
of
some
nondiscrimination
statute
in
the
state.
now
he
doesn't
have
to
hire
a
seventh-day
adventist
or
a
catholic
or
a
presbyterian
or
anybody
else
if
he
doesn't
want
to,
but
this
case
involves
an
action
between
his
appellant
and
the
sovereign
state,
the
state
of
south
carolina.
justice
potter
stewart
the
record
shows,
as
i
understand
it,
that
all
the
--
that
150
other
members
of
the
--
of
this
church
are
employed
in
the
state,
in
this
town
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
doesn't
she
have
to
apply
and
show
that
she's
applying
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
compensation?
justice
potter
stewart
violates
the
constitution,
wouldn't
it?
