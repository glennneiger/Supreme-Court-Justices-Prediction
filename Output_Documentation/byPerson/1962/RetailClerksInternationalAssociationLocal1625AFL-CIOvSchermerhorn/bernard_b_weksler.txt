mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please,
in
the
course
of
this
case
which
i
have
handled
from
the
inception
down
in
miami,
i
have
heard
two
startling
propositions
advanced
by
the
union.
one
was
advanced
just
before
this
court
a
moment
ago,
the
effect
that
congress
did
not
know
how
to
state
a
simple
principle.
the
second
startling
comment
was
in
the
brief
that
was
filed
before
this
court
seeking
the
writ
of
certiorari
when
the
union
boldly
stated
in
labor
relations
as
in
all
other
aspects
of
political
life,
the
power
of
the
purse
strings
is
the
power
to
control.
that
was
stated
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
where
the
question
that
was
presented
to
this
court
and
the
court
considered
in
granting
the
writ
of
certiorari,
was
not
a
question
pertaining
to
a
service
fee
arrangement,
as
the
union
is
now
seeking
to
name
this
particular
device
or
stratagem
or
gimmick
to
try
circumvent
section
14(b)
and
the
right-to-work
laws
of
the
state
of
florida.
the
question
presented
to
this
court
in
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
whether
the
florida
supreme
court
misconstrued
section
14(b)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
in
holding
that
it
authorizes
the
states
both
to
prohibit
and
to
regulate
an
agency
shop
clause
in
an
interstate
labor
contract.
after
this
court
granted
certiorari,
and
as
i
understand
the
rules
of
this
court,
the
certiorari
is
to
be
limited
to
the
questions
presented
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
then
the
union
switched
its
attack
and
now
refers
to
a
service
fee
arrangement,
which
is
supposed
to
be
something
separate
and
distinct
from
an
agency
shop.
and
i
will
quote
the
eminent
solicitor
general
when
he
before
referred
to
a
question
from
mr.
justice
brennan
that
there
is
no
difference
between
an
agency
shop
and
an
union
shop
and
i
believe
he
labeled
it
in
latin
as
“tweedledum,
tweedledee.”
i
will
say
that
a
service
fee
arrangement
is
the
same
thing
as
an
agency
shop
for
arrangement
on
the
basis
of
the
record
that
was
presented
to
the
florida
court
and
the
record
that
is
before
this
united
states
supreme
court.
the
record
clearly
shows,
as
mr.
justice
white
observed
the
complaint.
all
we
have
before
this
court
and
all
we
had
before
the
florida
supreme
court
was
a
complaint,
wherein
the
complaint
referred
to
an
agency
shop
provision,
wherein
the
complaint
had
affixed
to
it
as
exhibits,
a
so-called
important
notice
to
employees
which
is
on
page
7
of
the
record,
and
also
had
affixed
to
it
as
an
exhibit
on
page
8
of
the
record,
the
particular
provision
in
the
union
contract
referring
to
an
agency
shop
clause.
nowhere
in
the
contract
is
there
a
reference
to
a
service
fee
clause,
but
only
a
reference
to
an
agency
shop
clause
and
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court
in
19
places
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
the
brief
they
referred
to
an
agency
shop.
now,
what
has
the
union
asked
for
non-union
employees
of
food
fair
to
do?
they
have
told
these
employees
that
you
do
not
have
to
belong
to
union
if
you
want
to
work
here
for
food
fair.
we
very
graciously
say
you
don't
have
to
belong
to
union,
but
if
you
want
to
keep
on
working
here
as
a
condition
of
employment,
you
must
pay
to
the
union
the
same
amount
of
money
that
the
union
member
will
pay.
and
because
some
of
the
employees
of
food
fair
may
not
be
too
literate,
the
union
very
graciously
posted
an
important
notice
to
the
employees
to
explain
the
agency
shop
to
these
employees
and
stated,
because
many
of
you,
which
notice
is
page
7
of
the
record,
because
many
of
you
may
not
be
too
familiar
with
the
meaning
and
purpose
of
an
agency
shop,
a
few
words
of
explanation
may
be
in
order.
and
they
explained
that
under
an
agency
shop
that
even
though
the
union
and
the
company
have
agreed
that
you
may
not
have
joined
the
union,
you
are
obligated
under
the
provisions
of
the
agency
shop
to
pay
an
initial
service
fee,
which
is
the
equal
of
the
initiation
fee
for
union
members
and
a
monthly
service
fee,
which
is
equal
of
the
monthly
dues
for
those
who
voluntarily
become
union
members.
this
is
the
same
provision
that
is
in
the
general
motors
case.
they
are
asked
to
pay
the
same
amount
of
money
as
union
members,
which
is
more
onerous
than
the
situation
that
you
have
with
a
person
who
voluntarily
becomes
a
union
member.
now
many
people,
the
majority
of
the
people
in
the
state
of
florida
and
in
19
other
right-to-work
states,
have
by
election
determined
that
they
do
not
wish
to
be
members
of
the
union.
that
unionism
is
a
matter
of
voluntary
choice,
is
a
voluntary
freedom.
i
believe
if
a
person
wants
to
join
the
union,
they
have
all
the
right
in
the
world
to
join
the
union
and
they
should
be
able
to
join
the
union
if
they
so
desire,
but
if
at
the
same
time,
if
a
person
wishes
to
refrain
from
being
a
member
of
the
union,
that
person
should
also
have
that
right.
however,
what
is
being
proposed
actually
by
the
union
in
this
particular
case
is
that
after
the
supreme
court
in
three
cases
has
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
right-to-work
laws
of
states,
has
now
said
that
your
efforts,
you
work
has
all
been
in
vain,
because
even
though
states
may
have
right-to-work
laws
and
even
though
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
in
section
14
(b)
to
permit
states
to
continue
to
have
right-to-work
laws,
the
union
has
now
said
you
can
forget
those
right-to-work
laws,
you
can
forget
the
congressional
intent,
because
now
we
have
come
up
with
a
new
arrangement,
a
service
fee
arrangement
whereby,
we
might
say
to
the
union
member
or
to
the
employee,
you
don't
have
to
pay
the
same
amount
of
money
as
a
union
member,
you
just
have
to
pay
a
service
fee.
maybe
the
service
fee
might
be
ten
cents
less
than
what
a
union
member
would
have
to
pay.
maybe
we
can
setup
an
elaborate
bookkeeping
or
accounting
system,
whereby
we
will
say
the
money
that
came
from
employee
x,
who
is
a
non-union
member,
will
be
used
to
pay
the
cost
of
collective
bargaining.
the
money
that
comes
from
employee
y,
who
is
a
union
member
that
money
we
will
use
for
political
contributions,
we
will
use
it
to
pay
nice
big
salaries,
we'll
use
it
to
buy
a
building,
we'll
use
it,
we
will
use
it
for
contribution
to
some
worthwhile
charity.
how
is
the
average
union
employee
or
the
average
non-union
employee
able
to
determine
what
portion
of
this
so-called
service
fee
which
is
being
exacted
from
him
or
her
without
her
concern,
how
can
they
determine
whether
or
not
that
is
being
used
for
collective
bargaining
purposes.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
i
would
say
sir
that
they
cannot
do
that.
i
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
the
argument
on
that
is
the
fact
that
the
state
has
enacted
a
right-to-work
law,
which
says
if
a
person
does
not
have
to
be
a
member
of
the
union,
and
which
would
also
mean
that
the
person
does
not
have
to
financially
assist
the
union
if
that
person
does
not
wish
to.
i
say
that
the
unions
have
been
entrusted
by
congress
with
being
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent
of
all
the
persons
in
the
bargaining
unit
that
that
is
something
that
the
unions
themselves
have
sought
and
asked
by
congress
that
the
unions
in
becoming
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent
for
every
employee
who
is
in
the
bargaining
end
and
has
actually
now
deprived
the
non-union
employee
of
the
right
to
be
able
to
contract
and
bargain
for
himself,
for
herself,
and
in
this
particular
instance,
even
in
the
contract
which
is
affixed
to
the
complaint,
we
have
a
situation,
one
of
my
clients
is
a
woman
who
has
been
working
for
food
fair
for
over
eight
years
who
would
have
a
certain
amount
of
substantial
seniority.
this
contract,
which
they
allege
gives
people
many
benefits,
this
contract
specifically
provides
in
section
3,
page
six
of
the
contract
which
is
on
page
13
of
the
record,
specifically
provides
that
on
layoffs
and
transfers,
stewards,
union
stewards
shall
enjoy
super
seniority.
the
chief
steward
in
each
store
shall
be
the
last
employee
to
be
transferred
or
laid
off.
i
don't
know
how
many
stewards,
if
a
food
fair
store
has
30
employees
and
20
of
them
are
union
employees
and
ten
are
non-union,
maybe
the
20
will
be
designated
as
stewards,
the
other
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
no,
it
has
a
relevancy
in
this
sense
sir,
only
in
the
sense,
and
they
talk
about
benefits
that
are
being
given
by
a
contract
and
as
a
result
that
anybody
who
benefits
by
it
should
pay
for
it.
i
would
dispute
the
fact
that
it
necessarily
means
that
there
is
a
benefit
to
the
non-union
employee
by
virtue
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
having
been
entered
into.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes
sir,
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
because
now
is
the
only
obligation
that
can
be
made
upon
an
employee,
is
the
obligation
to
pay
periodic
dues
and
initiation
fees.
this
would
not
--
that
is
provided
for
in
section
8
(a)
(3).
now
this
would
not
come
within
that
particular
provision,
and
i
can
refer
the
court
to
a
case
decided
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
called
the
hughes
ii
company
case,
wherein
you
had
several
locals
within
a
union,
one
was
a
white
local,
one
was
a
colored
local.
the
white
local
was
paying
regular
dues
and
fees
into
the
union.
the
colored
local
was
not
paying
any
dues
and
fees,
and
the
union
said
that
it
costs
us
so
much
money
to
take
care
of
grievances
and
arbitration,
we
are
now
going
to
setup
a
$15
fee
for
grievance
and
we
are
going
to
setup
an
arbitration
expense
of
$400
and
those
of
you
who
are
non-union
members
will
have
to
pay
that
money
into
the
union.
the
national
labor
relations
board
almost
revoked
the
certification
of
the
union
and
did
not
do
it
only
because
of
the
fact
that
they
revoked
the
certification
of
the
union
for
seeking
to
get
this
type
of
an
assessment;
that,
that
would
have
the
effect
of
putting
the
colored
local,
deprive
the
colored
local
of
the
certification,
so
they
gave
them
a
warning
and
told
him
that
they
could
not
have
that.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes
sir.
this
case
fits
--
there
is
a
case
that
came
out
of
the
third
circuit
involving
oddly
enough
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
food
fair
wherein
the
union
went
to
the
food
fair
employees
and
asked
all
food
fair
employees
to
come
up
with
a
$15
strike
assessment,
this
was
not
a
period
due,
it
was
not
an
initiation
fee.
some
of
the
employees
at
food
fair
refused
to
come
up
with
a
$15
strike
assessment
and
the
union
sought
to
have
them
discharged.
the
national
labor
relations
board
held
that
this
was
an
unfair
labor
practice,
that
the
union
has
no
right
to
obtain
any
sort
of
an
assessment
or
charge
any
assessment,
because
under
8
(a)
(3)
they
are
only
able
to
seek
to
collect
periodic
dues
which
are
periodic
membership
dues
and
an
initiation
fee
which
applies
to
initiation
as
a
member.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes
sir,
if
the
national
labor
relations
board
would
feel
that
this
came
within
their
jurisdiction
that
certainly
would
be
a
credit.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
your
honor,
it
has
not
been
raised
by
the
record.
it
has
been
raised
in
the
brief
after
this
court
granted
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
and
the
solicitor
general
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
have
already
stated
not
only
before
this
court
orally
today,
but
also
in
their
brief
filed
in
the
general
motors
case,
that
the
board
is
of
--
and
i
quote
from
page
13
of
their
brief
that
in
preferring
to
an
agency
shop
that
the
board
is
of
the
view
that
such
an
arrangement
meeting
an
agency
shop
could
be
regulated
by
the
states
under
section
14(b)
of
the
act.
now
i
do
not
see
any
type
of
a
difference,
frankly
between
the
so
called
service
fee
and
the
agency
shop
because
congress.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes
sir,
i
very
gladly
not
even
have
to
discuss
anything
relative
to
a
service
fee.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
that's
right
it
is
not
--
and
well,
i
certainly
hope
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes
i
would
say
this
was
an
agency
shop.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
mr.
justice
black
that
raises
a
question
in
my
mind
because
as
you
will
recall
the
1946,
this
court
in
the
case
of
afl
versus
watson
pertaining
to
the
same
constitutional
provision
that
we
have
here
in
the
state
of
florida,
stated
that
it
is
up
to
the
state,
that
the
state
court
must
first
interpret
and
construe
its
own
constitutional
provision,
so
i
would
humbly
submit
to
this
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
well
it
might
come
up
mr.
justice
black,
but
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
service
fee
arrangement
is
embraced
within
the
florida,
right
to
work
provision
and
i
believe
that
possibly
under
the
construct
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
i
would
say
that
the
board
would
still
have
to
ask
the
florida
court
or
hold
off
until
such
time
as
the
florida
court
has
determined
whether
or
not
the
service
fee
arrangement
came
within
the
proscription
of
the
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
i
would
say
then
that
the
board
would
go
ahead
and
act
and
i
would
say
also
like
mr.
justice
stewart
commented
on
the
indiana
thing,
that
maybe
the
indiana
court
was
wrong.
i
think
that
the
nlrb
would
be
wrong.
and
then
it
would
just
be
a
situation
of
going
up
to
the
appropriate
circuit
and
determining
whether
the
national
labor
relations
board
was
right.
i
don't
believe
that
the
act
permits
or
authorizes
a
service
fee
arrangement,
but
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
actually
is
not
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
actually
is
not
in
this
appeal,
although
it
has
been
argued.
i
say
to
conclude
very,
very
briefly
that
what
has
happened
over
here
is
that
the
unions
now
are
seeking
to
usurp
the
powers
of
government
by
taxing
people
who
don't
wish
to
belong
to
a
union
or
finance
or
assist
a
union
by
taxing
them
with
the
cost
of
the
union.
and
this
was
never
the
intent
of
congress,
this
is
not
to
be
permitted
by
the
unions,
and
that
a
person
has
a
voluntary
choice
to
be
member
of
the
union
and
that
the
slogan,
“the
land
of
the
free”
is
not
to
be
substituted
by
the
unions
to
be
called
the
“land
of
the
fee.”
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
all
know
the
formulation
of
the
national
labor
relations
policy
does
not
only
take
into
consideration
the
rights
and
interests
of
the
unions,
the
rights
and
interests
of
the
management,
the
rights
of
interests
of
the
government.
the
formulation
the
national
labor
relations
policy
contemplates
primarily
the
rights
and
interests
of
the
individual
working
men,
that
the
taft-hartley
law
was
characterized
as
the
bill
of
rights
of
the
american
working
men.
i
am
here
representing
for
working
people
from
the
state
of
florida
in
fact
now
reduced
to
one,
those
three
are
no
longer
working
for
the
food
fair
chain
involved
in
this
litigation.
we
in
florida
believe
that
the
right
to
work
is
a
right
to
live,
the
right
to
be
able
to
obtain
money
to
pay
for
the
necessities
of
life.
and
we
feel
that
it
is
a
fundamental
right
that
can
only
be
protected
by
the
courts
and
cannot
be
protected
solely
by
an
administrative
agency
and
that
is
the
reason
why
florida
passed
the
right-to-work
law.
before
i
go
into
the
situation
as
we
feel
it's
applicable
here
i
would
like
to
respond
to
some
of
the
contentions
made
by
brother
lippman
particularly
in
response
to
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
the
state
of
florida
we
do
not
have
chain
gangs
where
we
send
union
executives
or
employers
if
they
violate
the
florida
right-to-work
law.
in
the
state
of
florida
we
do
not
permit
punitive
damages
to
be
imposed
by
a
court
of
equity.
this
case
was
initiated
in
the
circuit
court
of
dade
county,
the
equity
court.
i
was
the
attorney
representing
the
four
individual
working
people
at
that
time.
all
our
equity
court
can
do
in
the
state
of
florida
is
grant
an
injunction
to
enjoin
the
execution
or
application
of
a
compulsory
unionism
contract
which
this
court
has
said
this
agency
shop
device
or
gimmick
actually
is.
the
court
can
also
award
an
accounting
of
any
at
all
fees
or
dues
that
were
coerced
or
exacted
from
the
individual
working
men
because
of
this
type
of
a
contract.
the
court
can
also
award
court
costs.
unfortunately
our
florida
laws
do
not
permit
attorneys
fees,
so
the
court
cannot
even
award
attorney's
fees
or
punitive
damages
against
a
union
in
this
case.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
it
can
award
accounting
sir
because
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
well,
it
can
award
an
accounting
in
the
sense
that
any
dues
or
fees
that
the
individual
working
person
had
to
pay
in
order
to
hold
on
to
their
position
that
the
court
will
order
that
money
to
be
returned
to
them.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes
sir
a
court
of
chancery
in
its
overall
equity
jurisdiction
does
have
the
right
to
give
complete
relief
including
damages.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes
in
this
particular
case
the
court
would
be
able
to
give
damages
in
the
event
the
employees
had
been
discharged,
the
court
would
be
able
to
give
them
damages
in
the
sense
of
whatever
their
laws
of
earnings
would
have
been
mitigated
by
whatever
other
salaries
or
earnings
they
would
have
had
in
other
sources
of
employment.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes
sir,
but
it
could
not
award
punitive
damages.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
the
labor
board
is
able
to
have
the
individual
reinstated
and
have
an
award
of
back
pay
coming
to
them
so
actually
our
florida
court
cannot
really
give
anymore
than
the
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
ordinarily.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
no
sir,
well
in
the
event
--
i
would
say
sir
that
in
the
event
the
florida
law
did
provide
for
punitive
damages
and
it
did
award
attorney's
fees
and
make
the
execution
and
application
of
this
contract
as
a
misdemeanor
as
some
of
the
states
have
done,
then
certainly
their
remedies
would
be
more
drastic
than
the
national
labor
relation
board,
but
then
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes
sir,
i
say
that
was
the
intent
of
congress
when
congress
passed
section
14
(b)
whereon
they
said
the
states
may
have
more
drastic
remedies
and
that
was
also
expressed
by
this
court
in
the
algoma
case
that
the
state
courts
may
have
more
drastic
remedies
than
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
no
sir
if
i
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
florida
does
not
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
no
sir
there
are
20
states
now
that
have
right-to-work
laws,
there
maybe
more
states
that
will
have
right-to-work
laws
in
the
future
and
i
would
assume
that
some
of
the
states
in
order
to
prevent
the
spread
of
compulsory
unionism
in
their
states
may
have
in
their
laws,
more
drastic
and
more
punitive
remedies
than
we
have
in
the
state
of
florida.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes
sir,
if
this
--
yes
that
would
be
involved
in
this
case
mr.
justice
black.
now,
i
wish
to
comment
just
briefly
a
question
and
matter
that
brother
lippman
talked
about
that
was
a
hiring
hall
situation
in
texas.
i
believe
that
there
may
have
been
some
misreliance
placed
upon
the
case
because
as
i
understand
the
case,
the
texas
court
granted
a
temporary
injunction
based
upon
some
verified
pleadings
that
shortly
thereafter
the
union
and
the
employers
entered
into
a
stipulation
wherein
they
made
a
new
contract
without
the
hiring
hall
provision
and
stipulated
that
there
would
not
appeal
the
texas
court's
decision.
so
it
is
not
a
situation,
the
injunction
is
still
remaining
in
full
force
and
in
effect,
the
union
and
management
did
get
together
and
resolved
their
problems.
now
the
question
presented
to
this
court
is
not
whether
or
not
this
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
to
be
the
sole
and
exclusive
tribunal.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
congress
in
yielding
to
the
states
the
right
to
enact
right-to-work
laws
also
said
to
the
states
that
you
have
the
right
to
enforce
your
own
laws
and
certainly
it
would
be
a
unique,
not
an
eccentric
result,
but
a
unique
result
in
the
event
congress
says
to
the
states,
you
have
the
right,
you
have
the
continued
right
to
do
something
that
you
have
been
traditional
doing,
you
have
the
right
to
do
so
but
you
have
no
right
to
enforce
your
own
laws.
that
is
something
that
would
be
extremely
unique
in
american
jurisprudence
and
there
has
been
no
authority
cited
by
brother
lippman
to
show
that
there
was
any
other
contrary
intent.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
in
hill
against
florida
that
was
not
involved.
in
hill
against
florida
that
was
where
florida
said
that
a
union
business
agent
could
not
have
any
type
of
a
criminal
record
as
i
understand
and
this
court
held
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
taft-hartley
act
that
the
florida
could
not
impose
their
regulation
which
would
in
violation
of
the
national
comprehensive
scheme
of
labor
regulation.
it
was
not
a
situation
of
14
(b)
in
hill
against
florida.
14(b)
had
not
yet
been
passed
at
that
time
and
the
hill
against
florida
did
not
involve
a
right-to-work
statute.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
no
mr.
justice
black
in
that
particular
case
this
court
believed
that
with
the
florida's
imposition
of
law
upon
the
union
agent
that
the
florida
was
not
letting
the
two
parties
union
and
management
free
to
bargain
and
as
a
result
that
would
be
in
violation
of
the
law
in
existence
at
that
time,
but
again
it
did
not
involve
the
florida
right-to-work
law.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
it
involved
–
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
no
mr.
justice
black,
it
does
not.
that
hill
against
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
if
the
congressional
intent
was
clear
that
the
state
did
not
add
to
it,
then
the
principle
of
preemption
would
apply.
in
fact--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
the
question
of
preemption
has
been
raised
in
this
case
mr.
justice
black,
definitely.
and
the
question
of
preemption
is
resolved
by
the
clear
cut
congressional
intention
that
congress
did
not
intend
in
enacting
section
14
(b),
which
permitted
the
states
to
keep
on
with
their
right-to-work
laws.
congress
did
not
intend
to
preempt
the
right
to
work.
a
recent
case
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
mr.
justice
black
i
must
respectfully
disagree
with
you.
it
was
not
the
intention
of
the
taft-hartley
act
to
have
a
right-to-work
violation
be
construed
as
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
i
would
say
that
if
congress
intended
to
preempt
the
florida
right-to-work
law,
then
in
that
case
we
would
have
clear
cut
preemption.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
no
sir,
not
if
that
was
a
limitation
that
congress
imposed
upon
it.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
a
congressional
intention
was
to
preclude
the
states
from
being
able
to
do
anything
with
the
right-to-work
law
enforcement
once
the
state
was
given
the
permission
to
continue
with
right-to-work
laws.
that
is
the
issue
here.
now
in
connection
with
hill
against
florida,
in
new
york
we
have
the
case
wherein
congress
recognized
a
waterfront
compact
that
was
actually
between
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
state
of
new
jersey,
wherein
in
that
compact
you
have
the
similar
type
of
provision
that
florida
had
with
the
hill
versus
florida
case,
wherein
the
compact
recognized
that
a
person
having
a
felony
record
could
not
be
able
to
serve
as
a
business
agent,
which
was
the
same
type
of
thing
in
hill
against
florida.
and
this
court
held
in
that
case
that
the
clear
cut
congressional
intent
of
recognizing
this
compact
and
in
recognizing
the
waterfront
commission
of
new
jersey
and
new
york
meant
that
it
was
intended
to
not
to
preempt
the
power
of
the
state
to
be
able
to
regulate
on
the
basis
of
this
compact.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
i
think
that
was
deveau
versus
–
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
braisted
and
that
was
about
two
years
ago
and
there
was
some
comment,
there
was
some
comment
made
in
the
descending
opinion
that
in
the
sense
this
case
does
effectively
overruled
hill
against
florida.
there
was
a
clear
cut
case
of
congressional
intention
taking
care
of
the
matter
and
that
is
what
we
have
here
today.
we
have
a
situation
of
congress
specifically
spelling
out
in
congressional
debates,
in
congressional
records
and
in
section
14
(b)
that
nothing
was
intended
to
displace
the
states
in
their
power
to
regulate
compulsory
unionism
within
the
state.
now
although
the
contention
has
been
made
that
a
violation
of
a
right-to-work
law
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
it
is
again
clear
from
the
act
itself
that
congress
did
not
spell
it
out
that
way.
if
congress
had
wanted
to
make
a
violation
of
a
right-to-work
law
an
unfair
labor
practice,
congress
would
have
so
designated
in
the
act
that
the
violation
of
a
right-to-work
law
is
a
federal
unfair
labor
practice,
but
congress
did
not
do
so.
brother
lippman
is
trying
to
have
that
read
into
the
act,
but
it
cannot
be
read
into
there
by
inference
in
our
position
the
clear
cut
congressional
intention.
now
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes
they
would
have
put
proviso
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes,
they
would
have
put
in
there
that
in
the
event,
a
violation
--
in
the
event
there
is
a
violation
of
a
state
right-to-work
law
that
will
also
constitute
a
federal
unfair
labor
practice.
they
did
not
do
so
and
certainly
the
vociferous
opponents
of
the
taft-hartley
act
would
have
urged
that
such
a
proviso
be
put
in.
there
was
no
question
whatsoever
from
the
opponents
of
the
taft-hartley
act
which
they
characterized
as
a
slave
labor
bill
that
the
states
did
not
have
the
right
to
enact
and
enforce
their
own
right-to-work
bills.
in
fact
the
attorneys
in
congress
certainly
would
have
yelled
and
complained
vociferously
if
it
was
believed
that
the
states
could
pass
laws
and
yet
congress
and
the
courts
would
say
that
the
states
cannot
enforce
their
own
laws.
the
question
now
comes
up,
what
good
is
a
right
without
a
remedy?
we
as
attorneys
have
always
felt
that
if
we
have
a
right
that
we
have
the
right
and
the
power
to
go
into
a
court
to
have
our
rights
enforced.
now
unfortunately
in
non
right-to-work
states,
if
a
right-to-work
violation
is
committed
or
for
that
matter
there
would
be
a
right-to-work
violation
was
committed,
the
person
who
has
been
aggrieved
can
only
seek
relief
through
the
national
labor
relations
board.
and
if
the
regional
director
or
the
general
counsel
refused
to
act
on
the
compliant
of
the
aggrieved
party
that
person
has
no
recourse
whatsoever
to
the
courts
and
that
person's
remedy
has
actually
been
lost
because
of
the
failure
to
act
of
an
administrative
agent.
in
florida,
we
would
not
be
deprived
of
that
fundamental
right,
the
right
to
be
granted,
the
right
to
be
able
to
work,
the
right
to
eat,
the
right
to
live.
and
yet
that
is
something
that
the
union
would
seek
to
deprive
the
individual
working
men
of,
that
right
to
be
able
to
go
into
the
court
and
get
some
quick
relief.
now
we
can
go
into
our
courts
in
florida,
into
equity
court
in
florida
if
the
union
and
management
seeks
to
execute
a
unionism
contract
and
we
can
go
in
there
and
if
that
is
the
issue
before
the
court,
the
court
will
grant
quick
relief
to
us
and
we
will
have
quick
relief
within
a
two
month
period
of
time,
but
if
we
were
relegated
to
going
through
the
processes
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
which
the
federal
judges
characterized
as
a
sort
of
a
slow
march,
almost
analogous
to
the
march
of
a
wounded
snake
creeping
along,
if
we
went
into
the
national
labor
relations
board
it
takes
in
some
instances
at
least
400
days
before
the
final
decision
is
rendered
by
the
board.
and
when
the
board
finally
renders
its
decision,
the
board
cannot
itself
enforce
its
decision
if
the
board
was
to
enter
a
cease
and
desist
order,
the
board
must
go
to
the
federal
courts
and
obtain
an
injective,
an
injunction
in
the
federal
courts
which
might
take
from
the
time
the
appeal
goes
through
another
300
days,
possibly
700,
800
days
goes
by
before
the
individual
workingmen
would
be
able
to
obtain
effective
relief.
by
that
time
the
matter
is
merely
one
of
academic
interest
and
the
relief
and
the
remedy
that
the
courts
had
to
protect
is
something
that
is
meaningless
to
the
average
working
men.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
we
would
have,
we
would
be
able
to,
from
the
time
the
equity
court
would
grant
its
final
decree
which
would
be
probably
within
90
days,
we
would
be
able
to
be
up
before
our
district
court
of
appeals,
which
in
most
instances
is
a
final
court,
we
would
be
able
to
be
up
there
and
have
it
concluded
within
another
six
months.
meanwhile
we
have
a
situation
here
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes
and
i
wish
to
point
out
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
i
think
that
after
the
court
makes
its
determination
in
this
case
which
i
hope
affirms
the
florida
court
that
there
will
not
be
--
the
delays
that
it
will
be
consumed
because
the
determination
of
this
court
will
make
it
clear
to
the
right
to
work
state
and
it
will
make
it
clear
to
unions
and
to
management
exactly
how
their
rights
are
to
be
remedied
by
the
state
courts.
and
i
also
wish
to
point
out
that
the
unions
would
have
to
put
up
bonds,
unions
and
management
would
have
to
put
up
bonds
and
that
they
might
not
be
inclined
to
do
that
whereas
in
this
case
it
can
only
point
out
in
this
case,
this
suit
was
initially
started
in
florida
in
1960.
it
has
still
not
been
resolved
and
here
we
are
now
in
october
of
1963
and
i
recognize
that
if
it
went
through
the
national
labor
relations
board
we
might
not
be
here
today,
it
might
be
in
two
years
from
today
that
we
would
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
well,
as
i
understand
it,
it
does.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes
and
its
unfortunate
that
while
the
courts
are
slow
and
lawyers
are
slow
that
the
individual
workingman's
remedies
have
not
been
granted
and
that
is
a
reason
why
it's
so
important
for
us
to
be
in
the
state
courts,
where
at
least
in
the
trial
court
level
we
can
have
a
quick
determination.
and
i
am
not
saying
and
i
am
not
saying
that
the
trial
court
would
in
all
instances
grant
an
injunction
or
grant
relief
because
the
facts
are
going
to
having
to
come
out
and
that
trial
court
and
especially
our
florida
courts
have
recognized
strongly
the
preemption
doctrine
in
all
cases
that
are
applicable
and
they
are
very,
very
leery
of
granting
injunctions
in
union
and
management
cases.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
at
this
point
i
think
that
i
will
be
veering
off
slightly
from
the
viewpoint
of
solicitor
general.
i
think
that
the
lower
courts
and
any
right
to
work
state
should
have
the
right
to
enjoin
picketing
wherein
the
objective,
the
main
objective
of
the
picketing
is
to
enforce
a
violation
or
compel
a
violation
of
the
florida
right
to
work
law.
and
i
believe
that
the
trial
court
is
in
a
position
to
determine
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that
we
brought
up
before
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not
that
is
the
main
objective
of
the
picketing
situation.
so
i
would
go
and
say
that
they
should
be
able
to
enjoin
picketing.
i
may
add
however
that
in
the
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
i
would
say
that
the
hiring
hall
situation
as
much
as
this
court
has
already
said
that
a
non-discriminatory
hiring
hall
is
not
violative
of
a
right
to
work
law.
i
will
say
that
the
florida
courts
will
say
that
they
could
not
exercise
jurisdiction
over
non-discriminatory
hiring
hall
situation,
because
the
court
would
respect
the
opinion
of
this
court
and
the
findings
of
this
court.
it
--
i
would
think
that
the
state
court
would
entertain
the
case
and
on
an
evaluation
of
the
facts
brought
before
the
court,
if
the
state
court
felt
that
the
hiring
hall
was
a
non
discriminatory
situation
and
was
another
subterfuge
or
device
or
gimmick
to
circumvent
or
evade
the
state
right
to
work
laws
that
the
florida
court
would
hold
that
the
non
--
that
the
discriminatory
hiring
hall
was
a
violation
of
the
right
to
work
statute.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
no,
no
mr.
justice
white
i
would
like
to
say
so,
but
i
feel
rather
florida
courts
where
that
the
law
would
not
permit
us
to
do
that
and
it
would
have
to
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
for
initial
determination
where
in
all
probability
the
national
labor
relations
board
would
under
14
(c)
cede
the
facts
to
the
florida
courts
and
say
that
the
florida
courts
that
you
should
be
the
judge
and
the
arbitrator
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
an
violation
of
your
right
to
work
law,
because
under
14
(c)
the
national
labor
relations
board
can
now
cede
these
cases
back
to
the
state
court.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes,
yes
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
that
is
my
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
14
(c)
is
a
recent
amendment
to
the
act
under
the
landrum
and
griffin
bill
and
14
(c)
provides
that
the
board
in
its
discretion
may
by
rule
of
decision
or
by
published
rules
adopted
pursuant
to
the
administrative
procedure
act
decline
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
any
labor
dispute
involving
any
class
or
category
of
employers
wherein
the
opinion
of
the
board
the
effect
of
such
labor
dispute
on
commerce
is
not
sufficiently
substantial
to
warrant
the
exercise
of
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
the
commentators
have
all
referred
to
it
as
an
ad
hoc
authority.
i
believe
mr.
cox
will
be
able
to
show,
state
to
when
he
talks
about
made
by
rule,
or
decision,
the
decision
made
beyond
an
ad
hoc
basis
and
i
believe
mr.
cox
will
be
able
to
comment
on
that.
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
in
the
curry
case
that
was
a
situation
of
where
there
was
picketing
and
conduct.
that
apparently
was
under
dispute,
even
though,
even
through
there
was
some
disputes
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
yes.
that
was
an
allegation
and
that
was
dispute
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
mr.
justice
white
i
thought
that
i
had
stated
that
in
the
event
of
doubt,
where,
it
was
disputed
set
of
facts
that
the
florida
courts
(inaudible)
national
labor
relations
board
which
is
what
the
georgia
court
should
have
done
in
the
curry
case.
the
fact
that
there
was
an
allegation
made
about
a
violation
of
a
right
to
work
law,
does
not
ipso
facto
make
it
a
violation
and
the
court
was
enjoining
conduct
in
trying
to
prevent
consorted
activities
wherein
the
main
objective,
the
ultimate
objective
was
not
a
violation
of
the
florida
right
to
work
law,
but
to
obtain
rights
which
are
permissible
under
the
federal
act.
i
would
distinguish
the
curry
case
on
the
fact
that
there
were
different
facts
and
that
it
was
not
solely
designed
to
get
around
georgia
right
to
work
law,
even
though
as
they
say
peaceful
picketing
was
involved
in
that
case.
i
say
in
the
first
instance
that
when
there
is
any
doubt
the
state
courts
would
send
it
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
then
let
the
national
labor
relations
board
decide
whether
to
cede
it
back
to
the
state
courts
and
that
were
in,
incidentally
the
state
courts
are
to
utilize
state
law
once
the
national
labor
relations
board
sends
it
back
to
them.
now
i
wish,
i
wish
--
mr.
bernard
b.
weksler
it
may,
it
may
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
i
say
the
congress
did
not
intend
to
make
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
not
spelling
it
out
in
the
act
and
it
may
very
well
be
an
unfair
labor
practice,
but
that
still
does
not
mean
as
in
the
smith
versus
evening
news
association
case
that
a
matter
may
not
also
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
at
the
same
time
the
individual
can
go
into
the
state
court
to
obtain
their
rights
under
contract.
if
mr.
justice
white,
you
recall
on
that
smith
case,
the
unions
and
management
conceded
that
this
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
yet
they
were
permitted
to
go
into
the
state
courts
to
seek
their
damages
for
violation
of
collective
bargaining
contract.
you
may
have,
out
of
one
incident,
you
may
have
an
unfair
labor
practice,
let
us
take
the
violent
situation,
out
of
the
one
incident
you
may
have
an
unfair
labor
practice
where
you
can
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
you
maybe
able
to
go
into
the
state
civil
court
for
damages.
you
maybe
able
to
go
into
the
state
criminal
court
for
criminal
offence,
you
may
even
be
able
to
go
into
the
federal
court
if
we
take
an
example
if
the
violence
was
committed
by
the
use
of
a
jack
handle
that
was
barred
from
united
states
mail
truck
and
there
was
a
situation
of
abusing
government
property
and
have
the
federal
offense,
but
the
thing
is
that
you
may
go
into
the
various
courts,
congress
did
not
say
that
there
cannot
be
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
i
submit
that
if
a
matter,
if
as
the
union
contents,
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
that
would
be
contented
and
agreed
to
before
national
labor
relations
board
trial
examiner,
but
assuming
that
the
union
would
agree
that
the
matter
is
an
unfair
labor
practice,
over
its
own
state,
we
don't
agree
that
it
is
but
if
they
would
so
state,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
national
labor
relations
board
from
exercising
jurisdiction
and
also
the
state
court
from
exercising
jurisdiction
under
the
state
right
to
work
law.
we
conclude
by
saying
that
congress
did
not
empower
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
process
violations
of
state
laws,
but
left
it
to
the
state
courts
and
we
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
florida
court
and
do
not
permit
our
florida
right
to
work
law
to
be
mutilated
because
we
cannot
enforce
our
own
law.
thank
you.
