mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
prior
proceedings
in
this
litigation
established
two
points
beyond
dispute.
now
first
the
petition
is
agency
short
contract
violates
the
florida
right
to
work
law
and
second
the
florida
is
right
to
work
law
is
applicable
to
the
petitioners
because
their
operation
is
affecting
the
state
of
commerce
at
least
in
substance.
the
only
question
remaining
is
whether
a
state
has
jurisdiction
to
enforce
in
some
manner
because
there's
been
no
decree
here,
to
enforce
in
some
manner
it's
valid
and
substantively
applicable
law
against
an
acknowledged
violator.
we
submit
that
the
state
has
that
jurisdiction
because
of
the
express
declaration
of
congress
in
section
14
(b)
and
the
case
centers
around
the
meaning
of
that
express
provision
and
not
what
the
rules
would
be
in
the
absence
of
such
provision.
the
court
did
raise
in
its
prior
opinion
an
obviously
related
question
which
was
whether
the
execution
of
a
contract
that
violated
a
state
right
to
work
law
but
was
otherwise
consistent
with
the
proviso
of
the
section
8
(a)
(3)
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
national
act.
we
think
did
that
question
does
not
need
to
be
answered
here
because
it
seems
to
us
that
whatever
answer
is
given
the
court's
disposition
on
the
central
question
the
only
one
raised
by
this
litigation
must
be
the
same.
our
answer,
it
could
be
material
is
that
the
national
act
establishes
a
single
national
uniform
rule
and
that
the
contract
would
not
be
a
federal
unfair
labor
practice
under
those
circumstances,
i
should
discuss
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
would
say
that
â€“
mr.
archibald
cox
--
that
was
a
failure
to
bargaining
good
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
therefore
an
unfair
labor
practice,
i
would
--
but
i'll
say
it
now
but
i
will
cut,
no
doubt
i
will
come
myself
later.
mr.
archibald
cox
let
me
say
that,
we
suggest
there
is
this
difference,
that
there
the
state
law
is
the
framework
within
which
the
parties
was
to
operate
and
therefore
the
background
against
which
the
board
judges
whether
they're
bargaining
in
good
faith
or
engaging
in
protected
concerted
activities
and
since
they
must
operate
in
that
background
the
board
must
judge
their
conduct
in
that
background,
but
it
is
not
directly
enforcing
the
state
right
to
work
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
one
of
the
environmental
facts.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
it
would
be
i
think
under
those
circumstances
with
the
facts
proved
and
so
forth
a
controlling
one,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
a
controlling
fact.
as
i
said
i
shall
discuss
two
questions
in
the
order
in
which
i
stated.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
conclusion
that
section
14
(b)
leaves
the
states
with
jurisdiction
to
punish
or
grant
other
remedies
for
the
execution
or
application
of
an
unlawful
union-security
agreement
is
sustained
by
the
words
of
the
statute,
by
the
legislative
history,
and
by
the
uniform
interpretation
and
practice
from
the
time
that
have
currently
enacted,
really
down
to
the
first
argument
of
this
case.
ordinarily,
i
would
think
it's
appropriate
to
begin
with
the
words.
here
i
think
the
words
gain
so
much
meaning
from
their
context
and
from
the
background
that
i'm
going
to
take
the
liberty
of
discussing
the
legislative
history
first.
mr.
archibald
cox
14
(b)
your
honor
and
it
provides
that
nothing
contained
in
the
national
act
shall
prohibit
--
shall
authorize
the
execution
or
application
of
a
contract
requiring
union
membership
is
a
conditioner
of
employment
in
any
state
where
that
execution
or
application
is
prohibited
by
state
law.
and
we
think
this
has
the
effect
of
reversing
the
normal
rules
with
respect
to
preemption,
that's
the
nub
of
my
argument.
in
the
beginning
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
state
had
jurisdiction
to
adapt
right
to
work
laws
and
enforce
them
against
employers
and
labor
unions
in
business
affecting
interstate
commerce.
mr.
lippman
keeps
speaking
as
if
the
question
where
that
was
whether
congress
had
delegated
some
power
to
state.
of
course
the
states
unquestionably
had
that
power
and
the
question
here
is
whether
congress
has
enacted
legislation
which
under
the
supremacy
clause
somehow
takes
that
power
away
from
the
states,
by
preempting
the
field.
now
the
question
of
preemption
first
came
up
with
respect
to
union-security
contract
in
the
deliberations
on
the
wagner
act
and
it
was
clearly
expressed
in
committee
reports
and
in
statements
on
the
floor
by
the
sponsors
of
the
legislation
that
it
was
not
the
intention
of
the
congress
--
of
the
statute
to
interfere
with
the
operation
of
state
law
on
this
subject.
the
bill
does
nothing,
the
committee
report
said,
to
facilitate
closed-shop
agreements
or
to
make
them
legal
in
any
state
where
they
maybe
illegal.
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
status
quo
on
this
debatable
subject
but
leaves
the
way
open
to
such
agreements
as
might
now
legally
be
consummated.
mr.
archibald
cox
no
sir.
it
just
said
there
was
no
intentions
that
change
the
existing
state
law
and
that
it
leaves
the
states,
does
not
interfere
with
the
laws
of
the
several
states
on
this
subject.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
now
i
come
up
by
1947
when
14
(b)
came
into
plan
there
were
two
reasons
for
additional
concerns
about
the
question
of
preemption.
the
first
was
that
in
the
case
of
hill
and
the
florida,
this
court
had
held
that
section
7
and
8
barred
the
application
to
interstate
businesses
of
state
laws
restricting
the
employees'
choice
of
bargaining
representatives
and
it
said
that
it
barred
their
application,
the
language
is
quite
interesting,
because
the
collective
bargaining
which
congress
has
authorized
contemplates
two
parties
free
to
bargain
and
thus
cannot
be
frustrated
by
state
legislation.
i'm
emphasizing
that
the
word
authorized
by
congress
was
used
in
the
context
of
preemption
and
the
reason
in
hill
and
florida
for
saying
that
there
was
preemption.
of
course
the
argument
was
made
both
in
this
court
in
afl
against
watson
and
elsewhere
that
the
right
to
work
clause
could
be
challenged
on
the
same
ground.
congress
had
authorized
bargaining
about
union-security
contract
it
was
said
and
the
argument
went
on,
since
congress
had
authorized
that
bargaining
that
the
states
could
not
interfere
with
it
by
adopting
and
applying
right
to
work
laws
and
the
contention
was
and
this
was
so
strong
argument
that
it
overcame
the
legislative
history
that
i
referred
to
earlier.
the
other
reason
for
concern
in
1947
was
that
about
the
danger
of
preemption.
was
the
congress
intended
to
legislate
the
subject
to
union
security
far
more
comprehensively
than
it
had
done
before?
now
if
closed
shop
contracts
would
be
outlawed,
the
discharges
on
the
union
security
contracts
which
would
be
lawful
were
to
be
limited
and
in
the
original
taft-hartley
act,
your
honors
will
remember,
there
was
also
a
provision
calling
for
a
vote
of
the
employees
to
authorize
the
bargaining
representative
to
negotiate
a
union
shop
contract,
unless
there
was
such
a
vote
the
authority
would
not
be
granted,
the
contract
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
sir,
from
1947
i
think
it
was
1951
it
was
repealed,
it
was
subsequently
repealed.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
there,
that's
true.
no
not
a
decade.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
yes
it
stayed
for
a
year.
mr.
archibald
cox
alright
with
these
two
additional
reasons
for
concern
about
preemption
the
house
labor
committee
brought
into
its
bill
a
section
13,
which
appears
on
pages
20
and
21
of
our
brief,
which
is
so
long
and
cumbersome
that
i
can't
read
it
in
court,
but
it's
worth
finding
out
over
on
page
21
that
it
stated,
all
such
agreements
that
is
union
security
agreements
insofar
as
they
report
to
impose
such
requirements
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
law,
or
constitution
of
any
state
are
hereby
divested
of
their
characters
a
subject
of
regulation
by
congress,
skipping
a
few
word,
to
the
extent
that
such
agreement
shall
in
addition
to
being
subject
to
applicable
preventive
provision
for
this
act
the
subject
to
the
operation
and
effect
of
such
state
laws
in
constitutional
provisions
as
well.
no
doubt
from
that
language
that
it
was
intended
to
negate
any
inference
of
preemption
from
the
congressional
regulation
either
on
this
express
subject
or
from
the
more
general
provision
dealing
with
the
right
to
bargain
collectively.
if
there
were
any
doubt
it
would
be,
it
would
be
negated
by
the
committee
report.
the
committee
said
over
on
page
22
of
my
brief,
by
section
13
the
united
states
expressly
declares
the
subject
of
compulsory
unionism,
one
that
the
states
may
regulate
concurrently
with
the
united
states.
in
the
face
of
that
one,
one
just
couldn't
conclude
that
there
was
any
preemption
i
think.
the
bill
went
to
conference
along
with
a
senate
bill
but
had
no
provision
dealing
that
over
lapped
with
section
13.
when
the
bill
came
out
of
conference
the
language
of
section
14
(b)
was
there
and
section
13
of
the
house
bill
was
gone.
but
the
history
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
all
that
congress
did
was
substituted
a
far
similar
declaration
in
section
14
(b)
for
this
extraordinarily
cumbersome
recital
in
section
13
of
the
house
bill.
and
this
was
made
perfectly
plain
again.
the
house
conference
report
on
page
23,
i
am
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
it
was
never
the
intention
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
preempt
the
field
in
this
regard,
so
as
to
deprive
the
states
of
their
powers
to
prevent
compulsory
unionism
to
make
certain
that
there
should
be
no
question
about
this,
section
13
was
included
in
the
house
bill.
the
conference
agreement
in
section
14
(b)
contains
a
provision
having
the
same
effect,
there
can't
be
any
doubt
i
think
about
the
meaning
of
that
statement,
having
the
same
effect.
in
the
senate,
the
senator
taft
who
of
course
gave
the
chief
exposition
of
the
meaning
of
the
conference
report
directed
himself
to
this
express
--
to
this
subject
expressing,
he
referred
to
the
wagner
act
and
to
the
closed
shop
proviso
and
then
said,
but
that,
referring
back
to
the
proviso
in
the
original
act,
did
not
in
any
way
prohibit
enforcement
of
state
laws,
here
the
language
is
terms
of
sanctions
mr.
justice
black,
did
not
in
anyway
prohibit
enforcement
of
state
laws
which
already
prohibited
closed
shops.
that
has
been
the
law
ever
since
that
time,
speaking
of
the
wagner
act.
then
looking
to
the
new
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
bottom
of
page
24
of
my
brief,
where
i
am
quoting
senator
taft's
exposition
of
the
conference
agreement
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
i
pointed
that
he
used
a
word
applicable
to
enforcement
and
that
goes
to
enactment
when
he
spoke
of
state
laws.
then
he
went
on
after
having
spoken
of
the
wagner
act
and
said
that
has
been
the
law
ever
since
that
time.
it
was
the
law
of
the
senate
bill,
he
thought
14
(b)
was
unnecessary
and
in
putting
in
this
expressed
provision
from
the
house
bill,
we
in
no
way
changed
the
bill
as
passed
by
the
senate,
taking
of
course
his
interpretation
of
the
senate
bill
which
he
said
had
the
same
effect
as
section
13
of
the
house
bill,
even
so
it
didn't
the
express
declaration.
in
the
face
of
that
history
we
submit
that
there
can
be
no
question
about
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
section
14
(b).
mr.
archibald
cox
only,
only
equally
general
words,
the
word
that
prevent,
to
prohibit,
enforce,
regulate
concurrently
there
is
no
express
mention.
mr.
archibald
cox
nobody
mentioned
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it
was
clear
that
they
did
not
wish
to
overrule
it,
as
applied
to
other
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it
is
equally
clear
that
they
did
not
wish
it
to
be
applied
in
the
field
of
union
security.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
no
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
no
expressed
statement,
we
do
not
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
there
is
no,
that
was
mentioned
on
the
floor
i
think,
but
i
know
going
by
memory
and
not
by
anything
that
i
have
immediately
in
front
of
me,
there
was
mentioned
of
cases
like
afl
against
watson,
where
it
was
argued
that
hill
against
florida
applied
to
this
subject
and
it
was
quite
plain
and
it
did,
i
think
explained
from
the
language
14
(b)
mr.
justice
black
that
they
had
hill
and
florida
in
mind
because
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
but
i
think
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
i
think
it's
a
fair
inference
though
i
can't
prove
it,
that
when
the
court
had
said,
that
the
reason
for
preemption
in
hill
and
florida
was
that
congress
had
authorized
a
certain
type
of
collective
bargaining
through
representatives
of
their
own
choosing
and
therefore
the
states
couldn't
interfere
that
when
congress
came
to
prevent
preemption
in
this
area
it
said
that
nothing
in
the
act
shall
be
construed
to
authorize.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
execution
or
application
of
union
security
contract
in
fields
where
there
--
in
states,
where
they
are
prohibited
by
state
law.
i
would,
i
would
think--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
to
apply
it
in
the
algoma
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
those
were
cases
in
which
no
question
of
federal
preemption
or
interstate
commerce
was
raised.
in
the
algoma
case
where
you
did
sustain
the
right
of
the
state
to
grant
a
remedy
and
sustained
it
both
under
the
wagner
act
and
under
the
taft-hartley
act,
because
there
was
an
argument
about
which
applied,
the
state
was
allowed
to
frame
its
own
remedy
the
substantive
law
was
different
from
the
federal
law.
the
remedy
was
probably
the
same
as
the
federal
board
would
have
granted
in
algoma
it
was
certainly
the
same
general
character.
i
would
also
like
to
again
mr.
justice
black
to
suggest
here
that
what
congress
was
doing
was
negating
an
inference
of
preemption
and
if
they
negated
that
inference
it
certainly
goes
to
the
enforcement
in
carrying
out
the
state
law
â€“
mr.
archibald
cox
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow;
it
could
have
been
done
the
other
way,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
probabilities
are
very
strongly
against
it.
we
start,
i
think
that
no
one
would
dispute
this,
we
start
as
i
suggested
before
where
the
situation
in
which
the
states
may
do
both
and
until
something
happens
to
show
that
the
states
have
been
deprived
of
the
power
to
do
both,
they
have,
then
the
question
arises.
mr.
archibald
cox
substantively
and
carry
out
their
own
laws.
yes
excuse
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
then
if
the
congress
says
as
was
clearly
said
in
the
discussions
and
as
i
think
14
(b)
says,
we
don't
intend
to
preempt
the
field.
we
intend
to
leave
the
situation
that
would
--
as
it
would
be
if
we
had
legislated
it
all
that
then
it
follows
that
the
status
quo
continues
and
the
states
may
do
both.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
do
not
argue
that.
our
brief
skirts
the
problem.
the
logic
of
our
--
i
would
come
to
it.
we
didn't
mention
that
expressly,
because
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
decided
here.
our
position
would
be
that
the
state
might
deal
with
the
closed
shop.
that's
the
logic
of
our
argument
as
we
made
it
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
even
by
adding
an
additional
section.
now
let
me
say
two
things
about
the
problem
with
sanctions.
in
the
first
place
when
i
speak
of
adding
an
additional
sanction
i
do
not
include
adding
sanctions
which
would
profit
federal
rights.
for
example
it's
quite
clear
that
a
state
could
not
provide
that
no
union
which
has
ever
executed
a
unlawful
right
to
work
law
may
act
as
a
bargaining
representative
in
the
state
of
florida
or
nebraska
or
wherever
else,
there
is
a
long
line
of
cases
to
that
effect
not
just
in
the
labor
case.
but
leaving
that
to
inside,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
congress
is
willing
to
allow
the
states
to
enact
their
own
substitutive
law
in
this
area
allowing
them
to
provide
their
own
sections
is
a
comparatively
a
minor
addition.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
all
ready
implied
or
just
as
if
they
committed
robbery
or
burglary
or
discriminated
against
people
on
grounds
into
a
race
or
color,
violation
of
a
state
statute.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
believe
the
interstate
commerce
act
has
usually
been
held
to
occupy
the
field,
but
here
we
have
an
expressed
declaration
the
other
way,
if
section
14
(b)
where
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
our
basic
position.
so
i
would
make
these
mr.
justice,
i
would
be
making
the
same
argument
however
you
decided
the
underlying
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
it
is
only
in
violation
of
state
law
and
conforms
in
all
other
respects
to
the
national
law,
i
would
say
that
the
national
government
had
no
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
it
depends
--
it
then
would
be
otherwise
in
violation
of
national
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
that
case
the
national
board
could
deal
with
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
with
its
limited
revenues,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
after
all
mr.
justice
it's
like
normal
organization
in
our
federal
system
is
that
a
national
agency
enforces
the
national
law
and
it
does
not
undertake
to
enforce
as
such
provisions
of
state
law.
now
congress
may
have
to
regulate
comprehensively
to
occupy
the
field
or
it
may
as
it
sometimes
does
leave
it
to
the
state.
when
it
does
leave
it
to
the
states
it
is
always
left
it
to
them
both
to
enact
and
administer
the
law.
the
suggestion
here
is
an
utterly
unprecedented
arrangement
to
the
best
to
my
knowledge.
certainly
the
situation
in
federal
enclaves
has
no
resemblance
to
it,
because
there
it's
a
lack
of
territorial
jurisdiction.
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
think
that
the
cases
go
various
ways
on
that
as
they
do
in
the
preemption
area.
i
find
myself
that
i
confess
in
an
unfamiliar
position
here.
i've
normally
argued
very
strongly
for
preemption.
i've
argued
that
section
14
(b)
should
not
have
been
in
the
statute
and
if
i
could
have
my
brothers
on
either
point,
i'd
be
arguing
those
views
now,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
whole
history
of
labor
law
and
the
discussion
in
congress
and
the
holdings
of
this
court
show
that
14
(b)
was
intended
to
have
the
other
meaning.
the
question
after
all
came
before
this
court
in
1948
in
the
algoma
case
and
the
court
squarely
held
then
with
the
taft-hartley
debates
consideration
fresh
in
it's
mind
that
section
14
(b)
made
it
even
clear
than
it
was
under
the
wagner
act
as
the
court
put
it
that
the
states
are
left
free
to
pursue
their
own
more
restricted
causings.
section
14
(b)
was
intended
to
first
all
the
inference
that
federal
policy
was
to
be
exclusive
and
justice
black
and
justice
douglas
dissented
chiefly
on
the
ground
that
the
state
should
not
be
permitted
to
punish
somebody
for
carrying
out
a
contract
that
a
federal
agency
had
required
him
during
the
war
to
execute.
in
justice
black
opinion
that
says
this
taft-hartley
act
expressly
granted
the
states
more
leeway
in
regard
to
enforcement
of
their
own
policies,
enforcement
of
their
own
policies
as
to
contracts
of
the
type
here
involved.
mr.
archibald
cox
(inaudible)
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
of
course
i
said,
hope
i
said
before
all
right
i
would
have
to
recognize
that
this
is
an
imaginable
way
for
congress
to
go
at
it.
i
suggest
you
that
everything
points
in
the
other
direction.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
if
i
may
also
we've
covered
it
in
the
brief
to
the
problem
of
the
curry
case
and
the
problem
of
the
strikes
picketing
other
concerted
activities
generally.
i
think
i
do
it
best
by
taking
the
curry
case
farnsworth
chambers'
case
on
the
one
side
and
contrasting
it
with
this
case
and
the
algoma
case
on
the
other.
now
both
curry
and
farnsworth
and
chambers
grew
out
to
what
essentially
was
a
controversy
over
union
organization's
bargaining
right.
in
curry
the
employer
was
not
employing
union
labor
and
had
no
contract
with
the
building
trades
in
that
area.
there
was
a
dispute
over
just
what
the
union
did
say
and
just
why
they
started
picketed
and
the
florida
courts
found
that
the
aim
of
the
union
was
to
procure
the
employment
of
union
labor
and
therefore
issued
an
injunction
which
this
court
reversed
and
held
that
the
national
board
had
exclusive
jurisdiction.
now
farnsworth
&
chambers
is
essentially
the
same,
the
same
case.
it
again
was
a
dispute
over
union
organization
in
bargaining
rights
although
the
precise
evidence
was
a
little
different.
we
think
there
are
three
differences
between
that
situation
and
the
situation
in
this
case
and
in
the
algoma
case.
in
the
first
place,
in
a
controversy
over
union
recognition
organization
bargaining
rights,
there
is
a
very
real
chance
that
the
state
will
interfere
with
the
declared
federal,
may
i
continue
a
minute
mr.
chief
justice,
will
interfere
with
a
very
carefully
written
federal
policy.
the
federal
statute
in
section
7
and
8
guarantee
certain
rights
to
engage
in
concerted
activities.
it
prescribes
certain
activities
but
leaves
others
unregulated.
this
manifestly
was
done
with
considerably
subtlety
and
sensitivity
and
of
course
as
mr.
justice
black
suggested
earlier,
the
failure
to
proscribe
some
kinds
of
conduct,
guarantee
of
the
right
to
engage
with
others,
implies
that
what
was
not
proscribed
was
intended
to
be
left
free
and
that
as
justice
jackson
said
in
the
garner
case
is
the
fundamental
reason
for
preemption
in
this
area
in
the
absence
of
some
other
evidence
to
come.
second
even
in
those
cases
there
was
a
sharp
controversy
about
the
facts.
there
always
is
in
that
in
the
controversies
where
there
is
picketing
for
organizational
purposes.
there
have
been
no
formal
submitted
negotiations
and
demand.
this
conflicted
testimony
and
there
was
a
real
chance
therefore
as
always
a
very
great
likelihood
that
the
state
court
will
come
to
a
different
appraisal
of
the
fact
than
the
federal
board
and
frustrate
rights
guaranteed
by
the
federal
act.
third
there
is
really
in
those
cases
only
a
remote
problem
affecting
the
state's
law
concerning
the
execution
or
application
of
a
collective
bargaining
realm.
union
had
been
recognized,
there
had
been
no
bargaining,
there
had
been
none
of
the
give
and
talk
and
sacrificing
of
the
demands
that
takes
place
in
bargaining,
so
that
the
conduct
created
only
a
very
slight
if
any
danger
of
frustrating
the
state
policy.
now
in
this
case
as
in
the
algoma
case
one
has
just
the
opposite
situation,
but
the
contract
had
been
executed
its
terms
are
before
the
court
and
indeed
in
algoma
also
apparently
not
here
some
one
had
been
discharged
under
the
contract.
now
this
case
did
not
go
to
judgment
in
the
lower
court,
the
trail
court
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs,
so
we
don't
know
what
remedy
would
have
been
granted
and
certainly
they
are
entitled
to
go
back
if
there
is
any
remedy.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
not
the
slightest
room
for
doubt,
but
that
a
remedy
could
be
framed
which
would
not
interfere
in
any
way
with
the
area
of
strikes
and
picketing.
indeed
the
core
of
the
relief
they
request
is
a
declaratory
judgment
and
the
injunction
against
discharging
anyone
and
an
accounting
for
money's
collected
which
of
course
is
in
effect
an
application
of
a
rule
of
damages.
it
--
there
is
no
real
likelihood
of
interference
with
strikes
at
all.
so
we
think
that
one
way
of
separating
the
curry
case
and
that
problem
from
the
problem
of
execution
and
application
of
a
union
security
contract
is
to
say
yes,
the
states
may
deal
with
the
execution
and
application,
but
they
can't
deal
with
the
area
of
strikes
and
picketing.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
first
time
i
had
heard
that
suggestion.
i
might
say
it
was
the
last
thing
in
my
mind
when
i
wrote
14
(c).
the
general
purpose
--
[laughter]
mr.
archibald
cox
if
i
may
say
mr.
justice?
the
purpose
of
course
of
14
(c)
was
to
deal
with
what
was
known
as
the
no
man's
land
created
by
the
gust
decision,
the
area
in
which
the
board
was
unwilling
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction
yet
it
had
been
held
that
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
no
there
was
certainly
no,
well
of
course
there
is
an
english
house
of
lords
case,
perhaps
mr.
colin
will
remember
it
where
some
one
said,
the
worst
way
to
find
the
meaning
of
a
statute
is
asking
the
man
who
wrote
it.
but
i,
there
is
no
evidence,
no
evidence
that
congress
had
any
thought
other
than
dealing
and
it
says
by
rule
or
rule
of
decision
because
the
board
had
not
issued
rules
regulation,
also
i
always
thought
they
should,
that's
why
they've
got
in.
the
rule
of
decisions
were
broad
rules
of
decisions
that
they
would
announce
in
lead
opinion.
so
that
was
all
that
was
intended
to
do.
the
--
there
is
room
for
a
suggestion
that
where
a
union
strikes
for
the
purpose
of
compelling
an
employer
to
do
something
unlawful
that
there
is
an
anomaly
in
any
rule
of
law
that
says,
well
the
state
may
again
punish
the
employer
as
he
does
it,
but
it
cannot
do
anything
to
the
union
that's
trying
to
make
him
do
it.
our
answer
to
that
is
at
first
that
as
justice
stewart
said
yesterday,
if
congress
wishes
to
create
such
an
anomaly
that's
the
end
of
the
myth
and
there
is
bound
to
be
under
our
system
of
government
and
particularly
in
the
field
of
labor
management
relation,
some
places
where
the
joints
between
state
law
and
federal
laws,
after
all
the
state
laws
do
apply
to
some
extent
to
labor
unions
and
the
employer
and
there
are
always
going
to
be
problems
in
bringing
the
two
together.
third,
second
i
guess
it
is,
we
would
say
that
the
anomaly
isn't
really
very
great.
i
have
spelled
out
in
my
brief
that
there
are
remedies
in
merely
all
the
situations
that
can
be
embedded
under
the
national
act.
so
the
employer
is
not
going
to
go
save
in
one
very
rare
case
without
any
protection
at
all.
the
third
answer
on
this
point
i
think
is
that
the
court
needn't
decide
here
the
exact
scope
of
state
power
in
relation
to
strikes
and
picketing.
if
the
line
of
distinction
i
first
suggested
seemed
dubious
then
there
is
a
second
possible
line
of
distinction
and
that
is
with
the
states
power
extends
to
the
case
where
the
union
is
unequivocally
here
and
now
seeking
to
compel
a
violation
of
state
law,
but
then
it
does
not
go
back
to
the
more
remote
sort
of
thing
involved
in
curry.
i
prefer
the
first
time
myself
with
the
others,
you
know,
possible
one
and
so
that
we
think
that
there
is
no
serious
danger
of
conflict
or
confusion
between
the
state
law
and
the
national
labor
policy
in
this
area.
i
am
afraid
that
i
have
pressed
this
too
much
on
the
court's
time.
i
will
leave
the
other
issue
that
the
court
raised
whether
this
is
a
federal
unfair
labor
practice
to
submission
on
our
brief.
