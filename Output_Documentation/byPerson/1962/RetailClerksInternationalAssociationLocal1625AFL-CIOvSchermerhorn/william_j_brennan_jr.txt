justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
saying
now
mr.
lippman
that
as
far
as
this
record
is
concerned,
we
have
to
treat
the
case
as
if
all
union
revenues
were
expended
for
purposes
in
carrying
on
collective
bargaining.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
a
finding
to
that
effect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
lippman,
i
really
don't
understand
that
in
light
of
your
reliance
on
curry,
while
you
conceded
with
justice
white
with
even
in
the
crystal
clear
case,
state
court
granted
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
find
anything
in
curry
which
suggests
that
we
should
have
made
that
confession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
put
words
in
your
mouth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
you
had
a
record
here
that
told
us
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
we
had
a
record
here
and
you
told
us
we
don't,
showing
that
union
revenues
was
spent
for
other
purposes
beside
those
that
[inaudible]
to
collective
bargaining.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
only
way
it
can
use
to
sue.
that's
the
question
i
put
to
you
is
whether
there
is
anything
in
this
record
regarding
the
expenditure
of
union
revenues
and
growth,
is
there
anything
which
indicates
that
all
of
the
union
revenues
and
growth
whether
service
fee
or
otherwise
are
all
expended
for
collective
bargaining
purpose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you've
asked
us
i
understand
it,
to
consider
this
record
as
if
all
union
revenues,
inclusive
of
the
service
fee
revenues,
are
all
used
for
collective
proper
bargaining
purpose
and
nothing
else.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
ad
hoc
basis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
doesn't
sound
to
me
like
an
ad
hoc
authority,
a
case
by
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
i
correctly
understand
your
brief
you
are
arguing
here,
if
there
had
been
executed
in
outright
closed
shop,
clearly
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(3)
then
in
that
circumstance
is
the
matter
only
for
the
board
and
not
for
the
state
courts
in
the
right
–
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
argue
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
would
include
of
course
that
in
the
imposition
of
criminal
sanction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
would
(inaudible)
and
the
union
representative
wouldn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
happens
in
the
circumstance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
its
limited
from
of
with
its
limited
–
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
state
court
you
suggest
now
could
also
deal
with
it
with
the
harsher
remedies
of
whatever
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
do
you
think
of
advise
to
mr.
weksler,
are
you
suggesting
that
14
(c)
might
permit
the
board
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
think
you
are
a
very
good
one
to
ask
that
since
you
wrote
it,
it
surely
it
didn't
extend
on
the
ad
hoc?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
guess
we
could
find
unless
to
those
everyone
on
this
bench
