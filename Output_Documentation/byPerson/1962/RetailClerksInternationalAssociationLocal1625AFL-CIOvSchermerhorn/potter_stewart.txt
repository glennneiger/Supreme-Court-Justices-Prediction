justice
potter
stewart
how
many
such
states
are
there,
about
a
dozen?
justice
potter
stewart
twenty.
justice
potter
stewart
were
the
pleadings
alleged
this,
you
said
it
was
decided
on
the
pleadings?
justice
potter
stewart
but
don't
you
think
that
we
have
a
progress
to
that
end,
it
might
not
be
possible
in
this
very
case?
why
should
the
board
have
to
do
it
in
every
case,
this
is
one
of
those
reasons
that
this
court
is
here?
justice
potter
stewart
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
a
meaning
of
a
federal
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
but
right
here
in
this
case
we
have
now
before
us,
the
question
of
what
does
section
14(b)
mean
and
it's
--
certainly
there
is
an
opportunity
is
there
not,
to
contribute
to
uniformity
by
deciding
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
assume
a
state
has
a
law
prohibiting
the
union
shop
in
the
purer
sense
to
that
word,
i
choose
whatever
the
language
you
want
for
the
statute,
and
that
the
highest
court
of
the
state
says
this
is
all
it
means.
it
means
this
and
nothing
more
and
nothing
less.
do
you
think
it's
up
to
the
--
do
you
think
the
labor
board
then
have
the
power
of
saying,
well,
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
means
something
else
and
you
have
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
my
assumed
case,
yes?
justice
potter
stewart
you
call
this
a,
very
carefully
a
service
fee
provision
or
a
service
fee
arrangement
all
the
way
through.
let's
assume
that
it
was
not
that,
but
that
it
was
an
agency
shop
clause
as
it
would
be
is
titled
of
the
jurists
in
most
obvious
kinds
similar
to
the
general
motors
post
provision.
what
do
you
think,
do
you
think
that
would,
a
state
could
prohibit
that
under
14
(b)?
justice
potter
stewart
he
can
be.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we
know
the
facts
of
life
though.
justice
potter
stewart
well
this
means
then
that
these
people
are
paying
a
larger
than
their
proportionate
share
of
their
collective
bargaining
expenses.
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
exhibits
next
to
them
show
that
the
payments
here
were
exactly
the
same
as
initiation
fees
and
dues.
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
service
fee
might
or
might
not
be
an
entirely
different
case.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
the
service
fee
where
it
was
shown,
where
it
was
shown
or
whether
it
was
not
shown
that
this
was
for
collective
bargaining
purposes
only
and
it
wasn't
tantamount
to
membership.
your
point
is
that,
your
case
is
that
i
gather
that
the
payments
here
were
the
same
thing
as
initiation
fees
and
dues.
justice
potter
stewart
therefore
they
come
under
the
meaning
of
the
word
membership
in
14(b).
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
not
–
that
conduct
arguably
at
least
is
not
covered
by
section
14
(b)
which
referred
only
to
the
execution
or
application
of
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
it
so
eccentric
if
as
you
told
us
from
the
enactment
of
the
wagner
act
in
1934
until
1947
this
was
completely
accepted,
the
states
had
the
state
right-to-work
laws
where
--
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
it
all
of
a
sudden
becomes
so
eccentric
and
arbitrary
and
unreasonable?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
seems
to
me
if
i
can
suggest,
what
seems
to
me
is
eccentric
if,
it
may
not
be
the
right
word
but
unique
is
to
have
federal
enforcement
of
a
state
created
right?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
that
under
the
wagner
act,
you
had
cease
and
desist
order.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
mr.
lippman
what
we're
of
course
here
to
try
to
determine
is
what
the
congress
actually
provided
and
it
may
well
be
that
you
are
right
as
to
what
they
provided,
but
what
troubles
me
is
your
suggestion
at
this
point
in
your
argument
that
to
provide
anything
else
would
be
eccentric
and
outrageous
and
incredible
when
i
remember
that
this
is
actually
what
was
going
on
from
1934
until
1947
under
the
wagner
act,
you
had
a
closed-shop
permissible,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
a
state
could
put
an
employer
in
jail
if
he
executed
a
closed-shop
agreement,
couldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
do
any
of
them
provide
that
only
--
do
all
of
them
provide
that
only
the
union
could
be
enjoined
or
replenished
or
do
some
of
them
provide
the
---
justice
potter
stewart
on
both
parties
you
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
so
there
–
so
during
that
period
you
have
possibly
cease
and
desist
orders
going
on
against
employers
and
also
the
possibility
of
employers
going
to
jail.
justice
potter
stewart
you
certainly
are
not
intending
not
to
say
that
the
state
could
not
act
--
that
congress
could
not
have
provided
for
what
the
government
contends
to
be
the
law,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
as
the
matter
of
lack
of
constitutional
power
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
you're
just
saying
that
a
closed-shop
could
be
a
violation
of
both
it
is
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(3),
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
8
(a)
(3),
and
it
is
also
a
violation
of
those
state
laws
which
have
right-to-work.
justice
potter
stewart
well
a
state
can
remedy
violence
for
example
even
though
it
constitutes
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
potter
stewart
they
would
have
put
the
proviso
in
the
8
(a)
(3).
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
been
the
normal
way
of
doing
it
if
they
didn't
want
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
14(c)
in
the
brief
somewhere,
what
does
14
(c)
provide?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
i
--
can
sense
this
in
your
own
time
i
realize
you
are
just
making
preliminary
remarks,
but
how
about
union
which
insisted
at
the
bargaining
table
on
a
union-shop
provision
in
and
on,
in
a
state
which
has
such
a
law
would
that
be
an
unfair?
justice
potter
stewart
would
that
be
refusal
about
--?
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
it's
just
one
of
the
environmental
facts.
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
controlling
one
in
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
a
what?
justice
potter
stewart
we're
talking
now
about
the
legislative
history
of
the
1934,
the
original
wagner
act,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
not
of
14
(b)
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
your
way
back
in
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
in
the
statute
till
1951,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
was
there
for
a
decade
or
more.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no
if
you
please
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right,
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
by
doing
both
you
mean
what,
outlaw
them
and
enforce
--
justice
potter
stewart
third
position
mr.
solicitor
general
if
this
an
adding
punishment
because
it's
your
basic
position
that
this
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
that
there
is
no
federal
sanction
therefore,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
so
if
this
is
an
adding
a
cumulative
punishment,
this
is
a
matter
of
state
law,
not
a
federal
law?
justice
potter
stewart
congress
picked
an
awfully
funny
place
to
put
it
if
it
wanted
that
to
be
an
additional
condition
of
8
(a)
(3)
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
there
was
a
closed
shop
then
it
is
clear
that
it
is
unfair
labor
practice
that
is
a
violation
of
the
federal
act.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
relates
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
what
footnote?
do
you
have,
don't
bother.
justice
potter
stewart
