mr.
s.
g.
lippman
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
a
related
problem
to
the
one
that
was
just
argued
before
this
court.
in
our
situation,
the
local
union
and
food
fair
negotiated
a
collective
bargaining
contract
which
contained
a
panoply
of
many
benefits
to
the
employees
and
florida
being
one
of
the
like
to
work
states
which
prohibits
the
entry
into
a
contract
requiring
membership
in
a
union
pursuant
to
14(b).
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
there
are
20
at
the
moment
sir.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
we
negotiated
what
i
think
could
be
correctly
characterized
as
a
service
fee
arrangement.
in
that
service
fee,
and
it
is
set
forth
on
page
9
of
the
record,
although
it's
called
agency
shop,
i
think
the
court
will
recognize
that
it
has
substantial
differences
from
the
agency
shop
in
the
gm
case
just
argued.
in
that
service
fee
arrangement,
we
provide
that
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
florida
the
employees
have
a
right
to
join
and
not
to
join
the
union.
however,
the
union
is
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent.
it's
been
certified,
chosen
by
the
employees,
and
the
union
has
the
obligation
under
the
law
to
represent
all
the
employees
equally
and
impartially.
the
union
incurs
many
expenses
in
connection
with
this
representation
and
therefore
we
say
in
so
many
words
to
defray
the
cost
of
the
union
as
a
collective
the
bargaining
agency,
the
employees
who
determine
that
they
do
not
wish
to
join
the
union
would
be
required
to
pay
a
service
fee.
in
a
subsequent
notice
which
we
posted,
after
reiterating
the
language,
we
said
that
the
service
fee
would
be
the
equivalent
of
the
monthly
dues
and
the
initiation
fee.
i
might
point
out
that
the
issue
before
this
court
and
the
issue
before
the
florida
supreme
court
was
not
the
amount
of
the
service
fee
or
the
reasonableness
of
the
service
fee,
but
was
whether
or
not
one
penny
could
be
charged
as
a
service
fee
arrangement.
the
rationale
if
it
may
please
the
court
is
this.
a
union
has
the
obligation
under
the
law,
and
the
court
has
spelled
out
that
obligation,
to
represent
all
employees,
union
and
nonunion
alike,
and
to
represent
them
impartially.
all
employees
receive
these
benefits
and
the
record
of
contract
is
in
the
record
indicates
the
substantial
benefits
involved.
being
a
collective
bargaining
agency
requires
a
great
deal
of
expenditures.
i
think
that
is
clear
and
it's
spelled
out
in
the
brief,
one
has
to
hire
attorneys
and
negotiators
and
fulltime
representatives.
committees
have
to
be
paid,
records
have
to
be
kept,
contracts
have
to
be
administered,
cases
have
to
be
taken
to
arbitration.
and
so
we
say
that
if
you
want
the
benefits
and
you
have
chosen
us
to
obtain
benefits
for
you,
we
believe
that
you
should
pay
a
prorated
cost
of
carrying
on
as
the
collective
bargaining
agent
not
as
a
member
of
the
union,
but
as
a
member
or
an
employee
within
the
bargaining
unit.
now,
how
do
we
differ
from
the
agency
shop?
the
sums
which
are
paid
can
only
be
used
to
defray
the
cost
of
collective
bargaining.
none
of
the
money
could
in
any
way
be
used
for
institutional
or
labor
union
objectives
unrelated
to
the
collective
bargaining
function
of
the
particular
union
involved.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
no
sir.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
because
the
costs
of
collective
bargaining
are
ascertainable
just
as
in
the
hiring-hall
arrangement
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
in
this
case,
but
there
is
no
demonstration
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
right
sir,
in
this
case,
but
there
is
no
demonstration
in
the
record
that
this
particular
union
did
not
use
all
of
its
funds
for
collective
bargaining
purposes.
this
is
actually
one
of
the
other
small
unions,
it's
rather
unusual,
but
this
case
does
not
present
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
sum.
now,
it
could
very
well
be
that
in
a
subsequent
action,
in
a
subsequent
proceeding,
the
reasonableness
of
the
sum
could
be
questioned.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
there
was
never
any
trial.
the
case
was
decided
on
the
pleadings.
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
it
must
be
so
treated
because
this
is
a
sole
issue
and
this
is
the
sole
issue
which
the
court,
which
lower
courts
addressed
themselves
to.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
yes,
the
pleadings
point
out
that
the
employees
that
do
not
want
to
be
members
of
the
union.
they
do
not
want
to
pay
any
fees,
they
do
not
want
to
pay
any
service
fees,
and
this
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
florida
right
to
work
law
and
of
course,
constitutes
a
violation
of
section
14(b).
now,
i
was
about
to
point
out
and
i
think
i
did
point
out
that
in
no
sense
can
any
of
the
moneys
be
used
for
any
institutional
purposes,
that
it
can
only
be
used
for
collective
bargaining
functions,
and
that
the
relationship
is
the
relationship
between
a
union
and
the
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
and
not
between
a
union
and
its
membership.
involved
here
is
the
question
of
section
14(b).
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
yes,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
sought
to
develop
forenoon
the
argument
that
the
contract
that
we
have
before
us,
the
particular
clauses,
we
call
a
service
fee
arrangement.
it's
drafted
in
the
since,
requires
specifically
that
employees
in
a
bargaining
unit
who
choose
not
to
be
members
of
the
union
must
pay
a
service
fee
to
defray
the
union's
ordinary
costs
in
connection
with
collective
bargaining.
we
also
tried
to
make
it
clear
that
in
issue,
is
not
the
amount
of
the
fee,
but
the
principle
as
to
whether
or
not
such
a
clause
in
a
contract
can
be
nullified
by
the
state
of
florida
operating
under
section
14(b).
i
would
like
now
to
discuss
the
requirements
and
the
limitations
of
14(b)
as
it
impinges
on
the
–
and
raises
the
federal
preemption
problem.
14(b)
is
quite
clear,
in
that
it
is
an
exception
to
the
general
pattern
of
the
labor
act
and
provides
in
substance
that
the
states
are
permitted
to
pass
laws
specifically
prohibiting
membership
in
a
labor
organization.
now
congress
knew
quite
well
what
is
meant
by
membership
in
a
labor
organization.
it
is
not
a
difficult
ambiguous
word
and
if
there
is
any
uncertainty
about
the
matter,
i
believe
a
reference
to
the
legislative
history
would
demonstrate
what
congress
was
concerned
with
in
8
(a)
(3)
when
they
abolished
the
closed
shop
and
in
14(b),
congress
was
concerned
with
the
evils
of
compulsory
membership
in
a
union.
they
were
concerned
with
the
cecil
de
mille
where
an
employee
or
a
person
had
to
pay
assessments
for
political
purposes.
they
were
concerned
with
a
situation
where
an
employee
was
expelled
from
the
union
for
doing
unionism
or
an
employee
was
--
and
lost
his
job,
or
an
employee
who
testified
against
another
employee
in
a
court
proceeding
was
expelled
from
the
union,
they
were
concerned
with
the
abuses
of
internal
unionism.
in
no
sense
do
i
find
anything
in
the
legislative
history,
which
indicates
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
payments
to
the
extent
that
congress
did
have
such
a
concern.
it
did
have
an
amendment,
it
does
have
an
amendment
in
the
law
prohibiting
excessive
initiation
fees.
beyond
that,
there
was
no
concern
with
that
problem.
on
the
other
hand,
congress
did
throughout
manifest
a
concern
about
a
fee
right.
now,
since
we
have
this
exception,
since
the
language
of
14(b)
is
so
clear,
is
a
state
justified
in
taking
the
position
that
14(b)
goes
beyond
what
it
says,
that
is
a
validation
of
its
right-to-work
laws.
what
the
states
do
is
they
interrupt
their
own
laws
and
then
they
say
this
stems
from
14(b)
we
have
the
authority
to
do
so
under
14(b).
now
what
abuses
have
we
seen?
we
have
cases
coming
from
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
and
arkansas
outlawing
the
hiring-hall
based
upon
the
presumed
authority
under
14(b).
we
have
a
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
where
they
took
the
position,
where
the
court
took
the
position
that
an
exclusive
bargaining
contract
could
not
stand
in
face
of
its
right-to-work
law
again
stemming
from
the
authority
of
14(b).
and
we
have
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
in
south
dakota
to
the
same
extent.
the
states
do
not
look
to
the
language
of
14(b)
to
its
intent,
but
they
look
to
their
own
right-to-work
laws
and
under
the
guidance
of
that,
they
believe
14(b)
is
a
license
for
them
to
regulate
all
aspects
or
many
aspects
of
labor
relations.
in
this
respect,
i
raise
the
question
of
preemption,
clearly
where
a
state
were
to
go
outside
the
authority
of
14(b)
and
say
that
you
cannot
negotiate
on
a
particular
subject,
that
you
cannot
negotiate
a
hiring-hall
or
that
you
cannot
negotiate
a
contract
benefiting
employees
and
seeking
a
service
fee
in
return,
where
it
is
not
clearly
covered
by
the
language
and
where
quite
arguably
it
is
covered
by
the
provisions
of
the
federal
act
and
actually
protect
it
and
where
it
is
not
clear
at
all
that
the
states
have
such
authority,
it
seems
to
me,
if
we
are
going
to
obtain
any
kind
of
uniformity
in
the
first
instance,
it
should
be
the
labor
board,
which
would
have
primary
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
particular
subject
matter
folds
within
the
scope
of
14(b)
and
is
subject
to
regulation
by
the
states.
otherwise,
we
will
have
at
the
moment
20
different
states
each
interpreting
14(b)
and
carrying
rights
under
the
labor
act.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
mr.
justice
white,
in
my
judgment
it
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
well,
there
may
be
an
element
of
concurrent
jurisdiction.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
i
don't
concede
it,
but
i
raise
the
problem.
one
court,
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
took
the
position,
the
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
and
discuss,
took
the
position
that
the
state
merely
have
the
authority
to
declare
the
law
and
by
declaring
the
law,
it
could
very
well
nullify
to
provisos
of
section
8
(a)
(3).
but
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
yes.
we
raise
that
question
because
we
said
number
one,
a
service
fee
arrangement
or
even
an
agency
shop
is
not
within
the
scope
of
14(b)
and
is
covered
by
the
general
provisions
of
the
labor
act
and
therefore
of
course,
the
entire
area
would
be
controlled
by
the
labor
act,
and
under
this
should
we
take
the
position
that
where
there
was
an
arguable
question,
the
state
should
not
be
in
a
position
to
sit
and
determine
its
own
jurisdiction.
in
this
respect,
the
situation
is
not
entirely
dissimilar
from
the
case
which
this
court
decided
last
june,
the
meba
case
on
the
great
lakes,
which
opinion
written
by
justice
potter
stewart.
there
a
state
sought
to
determine
its
own
jurisdiction
by
seeking
to
interpret
what
is
meant
by
a
labor
organization
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
by
seeking
to
interpret
what
is
meant
by
supervise
the
employees
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
but
this
court
held
that
in
the
first
instance
even
there
it
is
for
the
labor
board
to
determine
and
i
contend
for
the
proposition
that
under
a
situation
where
a
clear
question
is
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
the
states
have
this
authority
and
where
it's
also
clear
and
the
question
raised
and
this
comes
within
the
purview
of
the
labor
board
that
in
the
interest
of
uniformity
and
the
interest
of
the
preemption
principles
which
have
be
so
thoroughly
explored
and
articulated
by
this
court,
it
is
only
the
labor
board
which
has
primary
jurisdictions.
otherwise,
we
will
have
the
most
terrible
kind
of
hodgepodge,
we
will
have
the
most
terrible
kind
of
impairment
of
rights,
states
interrupting
their
laws
and
saying
the
authority
comes
from
section
14(b).
now
we
could
have
a
situation
of
this
sought,
the
state
--
the
state
of
florida
could
adjoin
the
operation
of
this
clause.
we
could
turn
around
and
seek
to
negotiate
a
similar
clause
with
the
employer.
the
employer
might
take
the
position
as
it
did
in
the
gm
case
that
it's
--
i
can't
do
that,
it's
outside
of
the
law.
the
labor
board
might
issue
a
complain
saying
that
this
is
outside
of
the
scope
of
14(b)
and
the
employer
is
under
an
obligation
to
negotiate
on
this
matter.
14(b)
is
as
much
a
part
of
the
labor
act
as
any
other
provision.
it
is
a
limitation
on
the
board
where
the
states
act
properly,
but
the
board
cannot
carry
out
its
functions
unless
it
carries
out
its
functions
in
light
of
an
interpretation
of
14(b)
and
it
is
also
important
that
14(b)
be
given
a
uniform
interpretation
so
that
all
states
will
interpret
an
act
on
the
14(b)
in
the
same
way.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
well,
because
the
court
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
but
it's
a
federal
statute
over
which
the
board
is
given
exclusive
jurisdiction,
if
the
federal
and
the
board
is
given
the
primary
responsibility
of
protecting
rights
under
the
law
and
caring
of
the
policies.
if
the
state
interprets
or
passes
a
law
in
the
14(b)
which
impairs
any
rights
under
the
statute,
the
board
is
surely
concerned
with
that.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
of
great
aid
to
the
labor
board
to
interpret
14(b)
and
give
it
some
definitive
meaning,
but
i
would
also
say
that
in
the
final
analysis
the
determination
of
whether
a
service
fee
arrangement
comes
within
14(b)
or
the
outside
of
scope
of
14(b)
and
therefore,
a
protective
kind
of
activity
should
be
made
by
the
labor
board
which
is
expert
not
only
in
the
conduct
presumably
but
also
in
the
interpretation
of
a
statute;
14(b)
has
to
be
accommodated
to
the
rest
of
the
act.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
i
would
say
and
certainly
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
i
would
say
sir
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
in
a
situation
where
it
is
absolutely
clear
beyond
any
arguable
reason.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
that
there
i
believe
a
state
could
outlaw
or
could
prohibit
the
enforcement
of
that
particular
clause,
but
by
an
injunction,
but
where
there
is
--
but
where
there
is
a
great
deal
of
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not,
i
mean
taking
the
reasoning
of
the
colorado
supreme
court,
but
where
there
is
substantial
doubt
of
substantial
uncertainty
where
the
law
has
been
undeclared,
then
i
think
only
the
labor
board
can
make
that
determination.
i
don't
believe
that
the
principle
differs
markedly
from
the
principle
in
any
other
preemption
case.
if
it
is
the
preemption
doctrine
that
even
where
the
law
is
well
established
where
the
labor
board
has
set
it
down
as
well
established
that
the
federal
government
does
not
have
jurisdiction,
then
the
state
has
jurisdiction.
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
go
to
the
labor
board.
i'm
endeavoring
to
apply
the
same
principles
which
this
court
would
apply
in
any
other
kind
of
a
preemption
case.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
has
in
a
number
of
cases
indicated
that
14(b)
does
not
stand
in
the
way
of
the
application
of
the
preemption
doctrine.
it's
done
so
recently
in
the
curry
case,
which
came
before
this
court
where
the
state
of
georgia
sought
to
enjoin
activities
seeking
to
obtain
a
closed
shop.
this
court
held
the
application
of
the
preemption
doctrine
and
cited
garmon.
this
court
in
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
well
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
well,
the
conduct
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
with
–
i
frankly
--
i
don't
think
anything
anyone
knows
except
as
we
have
learned
from
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
any
kind
of
jurisdiction
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
no
sir
i
find
nothing
in
curry
which
indicates
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
based
on
all
the
indications
that
i
know
of,
it
appears
that
the
state
has
no
authority
at
all
to
act
in
that
field
except
to
declare
the
law.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
yes,
but
i
was
--
i
just
wondered
whether
or
not
if
there
was
to
be
any
area
--
if
there
was
to
be
any
area,
it
is
in
that
area
in
which
there
would
be
no
doubt
at
all,
but
even
there
i
speak
with
uncertainty
as
to
just
what
the
authority
of
the
state
court
is,
but
surely
i
don't
have
to
go
that
far
and
i
only
contend
to
this
proposition
surely
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
where
there
is
substantial
doubt.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
as
to
whether
or
not
a
service
fee
arrangement
comes
under
14(b).
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
by
the
florida
law
itself;
well,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
it
was
barred
by
[inaudible]
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
no,
we
didn't
concede
that
moving
to
the
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
well,
we
filed
a
--
we
filed
a
motion.
our
motion
to
dismiss
was
also
that
our
conduct
did
not
come
--
would
not
prohibited
by
the
state
law.
it
was
a
matter
of
interpreting
the
state
statute
too,
but
the
question
is
not
so
whether
or
not
our
conduct
to
be
condemned
by
the
state
law
but
the
question
is
whether
our
conduct
would
be
condemned
by
section
14
(b)
because
whatever
validity
that
state
law
may
have
in
the
field
of
interstate
commerce
is
dependent
on
section
14
(b).
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
if
14
(b)
had
never
been
adopted
again
i
would
say
in
my
judgment
there
would
not
been
any
doubt
that
appeal
was
completely
preempted.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
because
–-
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
yes
the
appeal
would
be
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
it
would
appropriately
lawful
agreement.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
yes,
if
i
understand
your
question
whether
or
not
an
agreement
for
a
service
fee
arrangement
whether
or
not
that
that
would
have
been
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
well
in
case
sir,
we
have
a
service
fee
arranged
with
the
employer
i
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
--
which
should
be
paid
employee
sir
in
order
to
defray
the
cost
of
collective
bargaining.
there
isn't
any
doubt
about
its
validity
under
the
federal
law.
the
only
question
which
is
raised
there,
was
a
question
of
14
(b)
because
quite
clearly
if
one
could
justify
under
it
section
8(a)(5)
because
the
union
is
a
bargaining
agent
has
the
power
and
the
authority
to
provide
for
its
own
operations
as
exclusive
bargaining
agent
and
in
any
event
it
would
undoubtedly
be
saved
by
section
8
(a)
(3),
which
is
a
much
lesser
kind
of
an
arrangement,
which
8
(a)
(3)
contemplates.
so
i
would
have
no
doubt
that
the
service
fee
would
be
lawful
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
i
might
say
however
that
the
only
question
under
the
federal
law
would
be
as
to
whether
or
not
in
fact
the
service
fee
was
a
sincere
effort
to
defray
the
cost
of
collective
bargaining
or
whether
or
not
it
was
an
effort
of
coerce
employees
into
union,
but
this
is
a
question
of
fact
which
the
labor
board
would
have
to
make
a
determination.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
sorry
sir.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
in
that
case
sir
there
would
be
a
surcharge,
there
would
be
a
violation
of
a
fiduciary
relationship,
violation
of
trust,
the
money
could
be
recovered.
this
money
can
only
be
used
for
collective
bargaining
purposes
and
not
for
any
institutional
purpose.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
at
this
point
i
part
to
company
with
the
solicitor.
i
do
not
believe
the
state
would
the
authority
to
bar
that
under
section
14
(b)
and
the
reasons
are
these.
i
believe
that
section
8
(a)
(3)
meant
what
it
said
that
the
--
it
is
perfectly
lawful
and
permissible
for
the
union
to
enter
into
a
contract
requiring
membership
in
a
union
and
that
8
(a)
(3)
is
a
lot
more
than
agency
shop.
we
have
thousands
of
contracts
throughout
the
country
requiring
a
union
shop
arrangement,
requiring
employees
to
join
union
after
30
days
of
employment.
now,
the
only
problem
we
have
there
is
that
the
union
shop
cannot
be
enforced
in
such
a
way
as
to
jeopardize
the
employee's
job
rights,
so
long
as
he
continues
to
pay
his
union
dues,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
he
does
not
have
the
obligation
that
the
employer
does
not
have
the
obligation
to
see
to
it
that
the
employee
joins
the
union
otherwise
congress
just
did
not
say
what
it
meant.
one
cannot
read
8
(a)
(3)
except
by
being
impressed
as
if
that
he
permeated
with
the
idea
of
membership
in
the
union
as
a
condition
of
employment,
or
the
base
indicate
that
this
is
a
compromise
between
a
closed
shop
and
a
union
shop.
now
the
argument
that
14(b)
therefore
is
also
an
agency
shop
prohibition,
stems
from
that
kind
of
a
fallacy,
that
8
(a)
(3)
is
nothing
but
an
agency
shop,
but
if
8
(a)
(3)
were
in
fact
as
i
believe
it
to
be
a
union
shop,
but
with
qualifications
as
to
how
you
can
administer
it,
then
the
entire
argument
would
fall
because
then
you
could
read
14(b)
in
it's
exact
language
namely
giving
the
state's
authority
only
to
prohibit
membership
in
the
union
and
not
to
prohibit
any
kind
of
a
fee
payment.
i
believe
the
mistake
has
been
made
as
result
of
the
misinterpretation
of
the
union
starch
case
and
radio
officer
decided
by
this
court,
because
in
all
of
those
cases
you
had
no
problem
at
all
about
the
employee
being
a
member
of
the
union.
in
my
judgment,
in
my
judgment
an
employee
who
says
i
refuse
to
join
the
union,
but
i
would
pay
you
dues,
that
employee
can
be
discharged
under
8
(a)
(3)
because
he
does
not
have
a
willingness
to
join.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
yes
sir.
otherwise
8
(a)
(3)
is
going
to
be
completely
emasculative,
but
you
cannot
impose
conditions
beyond
that.
there
are
two
conditions
you
can
impose.
one,
he
must
show
willingness
to
join
the
union,
which
is
basic,
and
thereafter
he
must
pay
his
union
dues
and
initiation
fees.
to
read
an
agency
shop
out
of
8
(a)
(3)
means
that
congress
just
did
not
know
how
to
state
its
simple
principle
and
i
believe
this
is
the
error
which
people
are
falling
into.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
no
i
said
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
sir,
i
ought
to
say
which
in
anyway
raised
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
fee,
that
the
only
question
which
was
raised
is
whether
or
not
one
penny
could
be
obtained.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
yes
sir
you
can
accept
those
facts,
but
whether
or
not
the
initiation
fees
or
the
equivalent
would
be
used
for
any
other
purpose,
there
you
have
--
there
you
must
also
be
faced
with
the
proposition
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
yes
you
do
have
a
record
if
my
may
say
so
sir,
because
the
contract
itself
says
it
can
only
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
defraying
costs
in
connection
with
collective
bargaining.
and
there
is
no
allegation
that
the
money
could
be
or
was
used
in
any
other
respect,
and
this
is
the
only
way
in
which
the
union
can
use
the
money.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
in
that
respect
sir.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
that's
right
and
surely.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
well
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
the
contract.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
well
but
we
say
though
--
but
we
say
so
sir
with
respect
to
the
particular
sums
collected
as
service
fees;
there,
there
is
--
there
if
i
that
only
leave
one
thought
it
is
this;
that,
that
money
can
only
be
used
for
collective
bargaining
purposes.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
no
sir,
it
does
not
mean
that,
because
if
they
were
in
that
position,
they
would
be
in
the
same
position
that
the
board
was
in
the
holman
case.
they
could
then
come
in
and
object
and
enjoin
the
collection
of
the
fund
and
make
sure
that
all
employees
were
paying
the
same
sums
of
money
for
collective
bargaining
purposes.
this
is
another
question
entirely,
this
is
a
question
of
the
administration
to
think,
but
the
sole
question
we
have
and
we
must
assume
that
the
sums
are
reasonable
and
that
the
sums
are
only
to
be
used
for
service
fee
arrangements
and
nothing
else.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
insofar
as
the
charges
concerned
to
him,
but
not
as
to
the
purpose
for
which
the
money
could
be
used.
the
non
--
the
member
paying
money
sir,
is
money
to
be
used
for
institutional
purposes.
there
would
be
no
restriction,
but
the
nominee
member,
his
money
could
only
be
used
for
collective
bargaining
purposes.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
i
don't
think
so,
because
he
is
getting,
he
is
paying
--
he
is
paying
only
what
he
should
pay
as
a
member
of
the
bargaining
unit.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
well
the
same
sum,
but
the
purpose
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
yes,
sir.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
pursuant
to
the
court's
decision
in
the
first
schermerhorn
case
decided
last
june.
the
court
there
determined
that
an
agency
shop
arrangement
came
within
the
purview
of
section
14
(b)
of
the
labor
act,
which
permits
the
states
to
prohibit
certain
kinds
of
compulsory
membership
arrangements,
and
that
the
agency
shop
arrangement
involved
violated
the
state
right-to-work
law.
the
court,
however,
left
open
for
argument
and
for
consideration
the
question
of
enforcement,
namely,
whether
or
not
the
state
of
florida
have
the
power
to
grant
a
remedy
for
the
violation
of
14
(b)
or
whether
or
not
this
problem
was
exclusively
within
the
province
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
in
deciding
the
schermerhorn
case,
the
court
recognized
the
close
interrelationship
between
section
14
(b)
giving
the
states
the
power
to
prohibit
union
arrangements,
and
section
--
and
the
proviso
of
section
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
federal
act
which
setout
the
scheme
under
which
unions
could
obtain
lawful
union
shop
arrangements.
indeed
it
was
quite
clear,
the
court
recognized
that
whatever
meaning
section
14
(b)
has
stems
from
and
is
related
to
8
(a)
(3)
and
because
the
court
in
the
gm
case
determined
that
an
agency
shop
was
within
the
scope
of
8
(a)
(3),
it
had
little
difficulty
in
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
a
state
operating
under
14
(b)
similarly
could
outlaw
that
kind
of
an
arrangement.
our
position
is
that
only
the
federal
government,
acting
under
the
labor
act,
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
remedy
the
violations
involved
and
our
analysis
is
the
one
which
the
court
itself
suggested
in
the
schermerhorn
case,
namely
that
without
the
proviso
in
8
(a)
(3)
any
union
shop
arrangement
is
unlawful
under
section
7
of
the
labor
act
which
broadly
guarantees
the
right
of
employees
to
engage
in
concerted
union
activities
and
to
join
or
not
to
join
the
union.
however,
section
7
says
“except
to
the
extent
that
any
infringement
might
be
authorized
under
section
8
(a)
(3).
in
section
8
(a)
(3),
congress
in
great
details
spelled
out
the
conditions
and
the
circumstances
under
which
a
union
shop
could
be
authorized.
it
pointed
out
that
there
must
be
in
the
majority
of
representatives
in
the
appropriate
in
appropriate
bargaining
units.
it
initially
stated
that
the
union
shop
arrangement
must
be
specifically
authorized
by
a
referendum
vote
and
then
three,
it
pointed
out
that
the
kind
of
union
shop
arrangement
that
you
could
only
have.
now
14
(b),
with
obvious
reference
and
relevance
to
8
(a)
(3),
says
nothing
in
this
act
shall
authorize
the
execution
or
application
of
any
kind
of
a
union
security
arrangement,
which
a
state
prohibits.
it
is,
therefore,
our
contention
that
14
(b)
is
as
much
a
proviso
to
8
(a)
(3)
as
every
other
condition
which
is
laid
down
in
8
(a)
(3)
and
therefore,
it
can
be
said
that
to
have
a
lawfully
authorized
union
shop
under
8
(a)
(3),
you
cannot
--
you
must
have
such
a
shop
only
in
a
state,
which
does
not
prohibit
it.
if
this
state
prohibits
it,
you
cannot
then
have
a
lawfully
authorized
union
shop
by
the
very
same
reason
that
if
you
did
not
represent
a
majority
of
the
employees,
you
could
not
have
a
lawful
union
shop.
if
in
a
referendum
election
the
employees
do
not
grant
you
the
right,
you
could
not
have
a
lawful
union
shop.
the
action
of
the
state
is
just
another
condition
and
no
more.
now,
it
is
the
cornerstone
of
our
position
that
the
execution
of
a
union
shop
arrangement
in
a
right-to-work
state
constitutes
an
unfair
labor
practice
pursuant
to
section
8
(a)
(3)
so
far
as
the
employer
is
concerned,
and
it
would
be
a
section
8
(b)
(2)
violation
so
long
as
the
union
is
concerned.
now
under
the
wagner
act,
there
was
no
effort
to
regulate
union
conduct
at
all.
while
there
was
a
provision
in
section
8
(3)
of
that
act
that
unions
might
negotiate
all
kinds
of
union
shop
arrangements,
it
was
pretty
clear
and
held
by
this
court
in
algoma
that
this
did
not
mean
that
there
was
a
right,
that
the
union
had
any
such
right.
as
this
court
pointed
out,
it
was
an
expression
on
non-hostility
and
it
is
quite
clear
and
none
of
the
parties
here
contend
otherwise
that
the
entire
field
of
union
shops
and
union
security
were
completely
and
totally
regulated
by
the
states
as
indeed
were
most
acts
of
picketing
and
boycotts
and
strikes.
the
wagner
act
did
not
enter
that
field,
and
therefore,
when
this
court
was
faced
with
the
problem
in
algoma
as
to
whether
or
not
the
states
had
authority
to
prohibit
union
shops
arrangement
or
closed-shops,
the
answer
was
quite
clear.
there
wasn't
any
problem
of
conflict
because
the
wagner
act
did
not
regulate
a
thing.
it
left
that
area
completely
to
the
states.
there
wasn't
any
problem
of
having
to
reconcile
federal
law
with
state
law
and
the
notion
at
that
point,
in
the
early
stages
of
the
development
of
the
preemption
doctrines
were
not
fully
as
–
were
not
as
fully
developed
as
they
are
today
following
garmon.
the
concept
which
the
court
looked
upon
as
controlling
was
the
concept
of
an
actual
conflict
or
overlapping.
the
court
was
not
concerned
then
as
i
believe
it
is
now,
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
arguably
this
is
a
protected
activity
or
arguably
whether
this
is
a
prohibited
act.
and
therefore
the
very
same
question
would
arise
today.
i
believe
the
court's
notion
would
be
on
a
different
posture,
in
a
different
plane,
because
i
believe
it
would
take
the
attitude
and
the
point
of
view
that's
expressed
in
garmon
rather
than
the
early
attitude
which
was
expressed
in
algoma.
as
i
pointed
out
when
congress
passed
the
taft-hartley
law,
the
situation
changed
radically.
there
you
have
the
most
detailed
regulation
of
the
union
shop
that
perhaps
any
country
has
ever
undertaken.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
no
sir
--
oh
yes!
it
was
after
the
passing
of
the
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
no
sir
algoma
did
not
--
algoma
merely
said
as
i
understand
it
sir
that
section
14
(b)
did
not
do
anymore
than
the
states
already
obtained,
but
algoma
did
not
attempt
to
reconcile
8
(a)
(3)
and
any
state
exercise
of
power
because
that
was
not
involved.
algoma
merely
said
there
was
a
violation
of
the
wagner
act
--
that
was
not
a
violation
of
the
wagner
act
and
that
the
states
had
the
authority
to
do
it,
to
regulate
the
field
involved
and
that
there
was
nothing
in
14
(b)
which
it
could
see
which
in
any
way
suspended
the
state's
power
in
this
area.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
yes,
but
did
not
focus
on
the
question
when
you
had
a
conflict
between
federal
power
and
state
power
and
this
is
the
question
which
we
have
before
us.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
yes,
if
the
question
rose
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
under
my
argument,
under
my
argument
that
which
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
labor
act,
the
states
would
be
powerless
to
correct,
but
the
states
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
it
was
an
opposite
result
because
in
wagner
the
federal
government
was
not
authorized
to
forbid
the
particular
act.
the
federal
government
did
not
regulate
that
area.
that
area
was
left
exclusively
to
the
state.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
at
the
present
day
under
taft-hartley.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
well
no
the
case
arose
before
taft-hartley,
but
was
decided
after
taft-hartley.
it
arose
under
the
taft-hartley
but
the
case
was
not
decided
until
sometime
in
1947
just
after
taft-hartley
law
was
passed.
i
am
sorry
sir
of
my
vagueness
of
argument.
now,
i
started
to
say
when
the
federal
government
laid
down
this
detailed
prescription
regulating
affirmatively
the
conditions
under
which
a
union
shop
could
be
obtained
and
impliedly
said
that
a
closed-shop
was
unlawful.
there
was
apprehension
that
this
regulation
of
the
union
shop
picture
might
completely
wipe
out
any
state
policy
on
the
map
as
indeed
i
think
it
was
a
proper
and
a
rational
apprehension,
and
therefore
to
make
sure
that
state
policy
would
be
considered
and
would
be
effective,
indeed
would
be
controlling
in
the
adjudications
under
section
8
(a)
(3),
14
(b)
was
written
into
the
law,
making
it
quite
clear
that
nothing
in
the
act
would
authorize
the
execution
of
a
union
shop
or
any
other
kind
of
union
or
any
other
kind
of
a
union
security
arrangement
where
the
state
outlaws.
this
was
no
different
than
saying
that
before
you
can
have
the
union
shop
in
the
first
instance,
the
employees
in
a
plant
must
vote
for
it.
if
they
vote
against
it,
you
can't
have
it.
so
they
decided
that
the
employees'
choice
would
be
important.
congress
also
recognizes
the
tremendous
feelings
on
this
subject
in
the
states
and
therefore
said,
“similarly
if
the
state
determines
that
it
is
against
its
policy
that
too
would
invalidate
any
efforts
to
obtain
a
union
shop.”
so
what
we
have
here
really
is
not
state
policy
or
the
congress
or
the
federal
government
supporting
itself
to
the
state,
but
actual
federal
policy
because
the
state
can
only
enact
these
laws
pursuant
to
the
grant
by
the
federal
authority,
and
that
it
is
a
very
limited
grant,
but
the
law
in
the
states
act
it
fills
out
the
area
of
section
8
(a)
(3).
now,
if
my
analysis
is
correct
that
a
violation
of
state
right-to-work
law
constitutes
an
unfair
labor
practice,
i
would
then
think
that
would
just
about
end
the
problem
because
i
think
all
of
the
preemption
cases
would
require
this
result.
the
government,
however,
does
not
concede
that
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
on
the
other
hand
it
recognizes
and
states
quite
candidly
that
the
interpretation
leading
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
unfair
labor
practice
is
warranted
and
is
supportive.
the
government
relies
however
on
the
legislative
history
which
it
thinks
it's
somewhat
clearer
than
the
actual
enactment.
the
government,
however,
does
not
--
is
unable
to
reconcile
this
court's
determinations
in
curry
and
in
farnsworth
&
chambers
where
this
court
determined
that
with
respect
to
strikes
and
pickets,
seeking
a
closed-shop
that
the
states
were
preempted
and
that
the
states
had
no
authority
to
enter
this
field.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
the
conduct
is
not
covered
in
that
right
specific
language
but
it
would
seem
pretty
clear
mr.
justice
potter
that
the
moment
you
acknowledged
the
right
of
a
state
to
enter
the
field
expecting
the
execution
and
the
application,
you
would
be
pretty
hard
put
to
say
that
you
could
not
therefore
enjoin
conduct
like
some
picketing
directed
at
obtaining
that
kind
of
a
result.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
well,
it
would
seem
that
congress
would
have
been
quite
eccentric
to
have
said
that
–
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
because
if
they
recognize
that
the
states
have
this
kind
of
a
concern
and
therefore
that
you
would
cut
off
the
line
at
this
point
it
becomes
a
highly
impractical
thing
to
permit
a
state
court
to
issue
an
injunction
restraining
the
actual
execution
of
the
contract
and
yet
at
the
same
time
permitting
the
union
to
be
on
strike
seeking
the
closed-shop
or
the
union
shop.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
but
i
believe
this
court
has
called
upon
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
rational
scheme
cannot
be
worked
out
or
whether
or
not
this
court
was
seriatim
and
permitted
eccentric
results
of
law.
and
i
would
say
only
if
you
have
the
strongest
kind
of
legislative
history
and
the
strongest
kind
of
language
in
the
act
which
clearly
compelled
that
conclusion,
only
then
would
i
say
that
you
ought
to
allow
that
kind
of
an
eccentric
results
and
beyond
that
sir
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
well,
because
congress
at
that
point
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
because
congress
in
8
(a)
(3)
in
great
detail
prescribed
the
conditions
of
a
union
shop
and
set
forth
clear
a
national
policy,
having
entered
this
field
in
such
great
detail
with
such
great
regulation,
one
must
assume
of
course
that
congress
intended
that
constitutes
an
unfair
practice
that
the
remedies
would
be
pursuant
to
the
remedies
under
the
act.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
you
have
federal
enforcement
of
the
standards
laid
down
by
the
federal
government
itself.
the
federal
government
has
said
that
they
will
respect
the
wishes
of
the
states
respecting
union
security.
the
standards
are
laid
down
by
the
federal
government.
beyond
this
when
you
consider
what
is
involved
in
the
execution
and
application
of
the
state
right-to-work
laws,
you
are
faced
with
a
rather
formidable
problem
sir
because
there
you
have
not
a
cease
and
desist
remedy
which
i
think
is
the
cornerstone
in
the
administration
of
the
labor
act
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
yes
you
have
--
we
have
that
probably
with
respective
violation
of
8
(a)
(3).
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
not
against
labor
unions,
it
did
not
seek
to
regulate
labor
unions
sir,
but
here
you
have
a
complete
detailed
machinery
worked
out,
a
complete
scheme,
and
now
we
are
to
say
that
congress
in
regulating
this
field
permits
the
states
to
throw
people
into
jail
for
violating
the
right-to-work
law,
to
fine
them
and
to
establish
other
punitive
remedies,
also
private
injunctions,
all
of
these
things
are
so
completely
antagonistic
and
contradictory
to
the
scheme
laid
out
for
the
regulation
of
labor
relations
in
this
country.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
yes
it
was.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
because
--
it's
not
anomalous
sir
because
congress
did
not
attempt
in
anyway
to
regulate
union
activities
under
the
wagner
act.
the
only
aspect
of
labor
relations
which
it
sought
to
regulate
was
the
employer
unfair
labor
practices
and
therefore
it
left
that
field
to
the
states.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
well
i
suppose
if
it
had
such
a
law
at
that
time,
it
probably
could
do
so.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
well
at
the
time
of
enactment
of
the
taft-hartley
law,
there
were
about
twelve
laws
of
that
sort.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
it
provides
penalties
for
the
execution
of
i
resume
all
parties.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
i
presume
that,
yeah,
all
parties.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
but
remember
sir
at
that
time
it
was
not
national
policy
to
regulate
the
affairs
of
unions,
congress
did
not
concern
itself
with
entire
field
of
union
security,
the
moment
however
that
congress
began
–
felt
it
was
necessary
to
regulate
union
conduct,
the
moment
congress
felt
it
was
important
that
it
come
to
grips
with
the
union
security
problem
and
laid
down
a
scheme
for
handling
it,
congress
took
that
matter
to
hand,
at
that
point
it
was
completely
anomalous
to
say
that
in
one
state
we
violate
8
(a)
(
3),
you
are
subject
to
a
cease
and
desist
order
and
in
a
second
state
you
got
a
jail.
so
long
as
there
was
not
a
matter
of
congressional
concern
then
obviously
the
state
could
act,
but
the
moment
it
became
a
matter
of
congressional
concern,
then
the
states
could
not
act.
that's
what
i'm
saying
sir.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
yes
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
no
sir,
no
sir.
i
would
say
that
it
would
not
--
i
would
say
that
is
so
contrary
to
the
scheme
of
handling
labor
relations
in
this
country,
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
that
kind
of
a
result.
now
to
show
you
or
at
least
to
demonstrate
the
anomalies
involved,
the
government
recognizes
that
if
they
if
a
closed
shop
were
to
be
executed,
this
would
constitute
only
a
violation
of
the
federal
law
and
would
not
constitute
a
violation
or
rather
and
that
the
states
could
not
pass
upon
that
(inaudible)
because
a
closed-shop
the
government
recognized
is
quite
clearly
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
yet
of
course
it
equally
constitutes
a
violation
of
a
state
right-to-work
law.
indeed
many
of
the
state
right-to-work
laws,
it
could
be
argued
were
really
primarily
aimed
at
the
closed-shop
and
they
were
called
in
fact
closed-shop
laws.
now
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
i'm
saying
sir
that
the
moment
it
becomes
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(3),
it
cannot
be
a
violation
or
rather
that
the
only
remedy
involved
is
the
remedy
provided
for
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
that
the
state
cannot,
cannot
remedy
that
--
this
conduct
under
its
laws
because
that
field
in
the
closed-shop
is
completely
regulated
and
remedied
by
the
labor
act.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
violence
sir
is
another
aspect.
when
the
state
remedies
violence
as
remedy,
the
same
kind
of
conduct
which
if
it
occurs
in
any
street
corner
or
in
any
house,
it
is
not
regulating
labor
relations,
it
is
regulating
under
it
police
power,
tortuous
and
criminal
conduct.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
thank
you
sir.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
sought
to
develop
the
argument
that
there
is
a
complete
integration
between
section
14
(b)
and
section
8
(a)
(3),
point
being
that
but
for
the
proviso
in
section
8
(a)
(3)
setting
forth
the
conditions
under
which
a
union
can
obtain
a
valid
union
shop
or
a
union
security
arrangement;
but,
for
that
proviso,
it
would
otherwise
constitute
an
unfair
labor
practice.
i
sought
to
point
out
that
14
(b)
was
as
much
a
proviso
as
that
which
is
explicitly
stated
in
8
(a)
(3).
it
would,
obviously,
seem
quite
anomalous
for
congress
to
grant
the
authority
of
the
states
to
outlaw,
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law
a
union
shop
and
then
at
the
same
time
to
say
that
this
is
permissible
under
the
proviso.
i
think
any
fair
reading
would
indicate
as
this
court
has
i
think
indicated
in
the
first
schermerhorn
case
that
there
is
the
complete
interrelationship
between
these
sections.
beyond
that
i
endeavor
to
point
out
that
when
one
contemplates
the
punitive
aspects
of
state
enforcement,
it
would
seem
utterly
incomprehensible
and
beyond
belief
that
congress,
which
attempted
to
set
out
this
entire
scheme
of
labor
relations,
would
have
permitted
that
kind
of
conduct.
at
the
point
of
adjournment,
i
stated
the
position
as
i
understood
it
of
the
government
and
we
find
that
we
are
not
as
far
apart
as
we
thought
we
were.
the
government
agrees
that
all
conduct
prior
to
the
actual
execution
of
the
contract,
the
strikes
and
picketing
and
boycott
which
may
take
place
is
preemptive
and
is
exclusively
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government
and
i
believe
it
must
take
that
position
because
of
the
major
thrust
of
the
curry
case.
i
do
believe,
however,
that
the
strikes
and
picketing
and
the
execution
are
so
much
part
of
the
same
ball
of
wax
that
it
seems
almost
arbitrary
to
draw
the
line
at
that
particular
point.
of
course,
if
my
--
if
our
first
contention
is
correct
as
i
believe
it
is,
that
the
execution
of
a
law
in
violation
of
a
state
right
to
work
law
constitutes
an
unfair
labor
practice,
i
think
that
would
be
dispositive
of
the
issue.
on
the
other
hand,
let's
examine
some
aspects
of
the
government's
position,
because
in
our
mind
the
administration
of
the
execution
on
the
application
is
so
thoroughly
related
to
other
provisions
of
the
labor
act
that
one
would
be
faced
with
continuous
conflicts
in
substance
and
in
administration
and
would
take
this
court
years
to
unravel
the
puzzle.
the
first
point,
the
actual
exe
--
seeking
to
enjoin
the
actual
execution
of
a
contract
alleged
to
violate
the
state
right
to
work
law
would
immediately
constitute
interference
with
the
collective
bargaining
process.
at
what
point
does
the
state
say
that
there
is
a
threat
that
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
violative
of
its
law
is
about
to
be
executed.
this,
of
course,
must
look
to
the
actual
processes
involved
and
the
collective
bargaining
involved.
beyond
that,
we
have
seen
how
zealous
the
states
are
in
finding
violations
of
its
right
to
work
law.
indeed
as
this
court
has
observed
in
the
agency
shop
case,
the
schermerhorn
case,
it
would
have
been
best
in
this
situation
where
there
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
agency
shop
falls
within
the
proviso
to
permit
the
federal
government
in
the
first
instance
to
make
that
determination.
we
have
even
a
more
dramatic
illustration
of
that
in
connection
with
the
hiring
hall
situations.
the
state
of
texas,
the
attorney
general,
and
some
of
lower
courts
have
held
that
a
hiring
hall
violates
its
right
to
work
laws.
it
has
enjoined
the
picketing
and
the
strikes
in
that
connection.
a
year-and-a-half
later,
the
labor
board
in
the
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
said
that
this
is
a
permissible
activity,
but
the
union,
of
course,
is
still
enjoined.
now,
what
about
a
question
of
a
discharge
under
a
union
security
contract
and
a
right
to
work
state?
a
complaint
is
filed
saying
that
the
individual's
discharge
because
he
refused
to
join
or
remain
a
member
of
the
union.
the
defense
of
the
union
and
the
employer
is
that
he
was
not
discharged
for
that
purpose,
but
he
was
discharged
pursuant
to
his
seniority
clause
in
the
contract.
this
raised
the
question
of
intent
and
the
surrounding
circumstances.
the
very
kind
of
problems
that
congress,
i
believe,
has
left
to
the
expertise
of
the
board.
if
the
court
should
find
--
a
state
court
should
find
that
the
discharge
was
unlawful
it
could
be
wrong,
the
board
might
have
come
to
another
conclusion.
the
court
thereby
has
interfered
with
the
collective
bargaining
process
(inaudible)
and
the
court
has
interfered
with
section
7
rights,
because
this
contract
was
negotiated
pursuant
to
section
7.
the
point
being
that
at
every
stage
in
the
administration
of
an
executed
contract,
you
invariably
come
into
conflict
with
the
scheme
of
the
federal
law.
let's
take
the
example
of
a
minority
union,
which
executes
a
contract
containing
the
unlawful
union
security
clause
in
the
state.
this
plainly
constitutes
an
unfair
labor
practice,
because
the
minority
union
in
the
first
place
has
no
business
negotiating
contracts
with
the
employer
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent.
it
constitutes
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(3),
it
constitutes
a
violation
of
other
sections
of
the
law.
plainly
the
labor
board
would
enjoin
that
kind
of
a
contract,
it
would
set
aside
that
kind
of
a
contract,
shall
we
then
say
that
the
labor
board
has
lost
its
jurisdiction
because
it
contained
an
illegal
union
security
clause?
take
the
situation
of
a
majority
union.
a
majority
union
executes
that
kind
of
a
contract
and
plainly
in
a
minority
union
case
the
labor
board
has
jurisdiction,
but
in
the
majority
case
it
would
be
urged
under
no
circumstances
does
the
labor
board
have
any
jurisdiction.
but
then
suppose
the
majority
union
is
bargaining
for
such
a
contract
to
the
point
of
impasse
and
then
goes
on
strike
to
obtain
it,
the
government
would
recognize
that
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction
and
the
state
courts
to
enjoin
that
strike.
that
would
be
a
matter
for
the
labor
board,
but
if
it
succeeded
in
pressuring
the
employer
into
granting
it
the
contract
only
at
that
point
would
the
state
courts
have
jurisdiction
and
by
some
magic
the
federal
government
would
loose
jurisdiction.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
the
board
--
i
would
expect
the
board
to
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order.
i
would
expect
the
board
to
find
if
the
violations
were
serious
enough
to
obtain
an
injunction
under
section
(10)
(j)
and
this
is
a
government
injunction
because
there
is
full
relief
in
that
kind
of
a
situation.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
well,
they
relieved
--
first
of
all,
the
question
if
you
pardon
me
sir,
the
basic
question
is
whether
or
not
congress
has
regulated
this
field?
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
alright.
the
difference
relief
is
this.
in
a
state
court
not
the
union
would
be
subject
to
all
damages
in
connection
with
the
strike
including
punitive
damages
if
a
state
were
to
take
jurisdiction
in
that
kind
of
a
situation.
in
addition
to
that,
if
it
occurred
in
the
state
of
georgia
the
officials
might
be
very
well
(inaudible),
there
is
just
that
difference
which
is
very,
very
substantial.
now,
i
will
end
my
direct
statement
to
the
court
by
pointing
out
that
in
this
entire
field,
there
is
such
a
close
interrelationship
that
one
cannot
permit
the
states
to
enter
into
this
field
without,
at
the
same
time,
creating
an
unwarranted
intrusion
in
the
actual
application
and
in
the
execution
of
the
law.
this
is
a
field
which
i
believe
congress
has
left
to
the
federal
government
and
the
idea
of
any
kind
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
would
actually
in
practical
operations
completely
oust
the
federal
government
of
its
regulatory
powers.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
well
i
would
take
it
sir,
i
think
i
just
a
few
remarks
to
make.
i
think
the
solicitor
has
candidly
discussed
the
matter
and
i
think
it
has
resulted
in
enlightenment
and
the
point
that
struck
me
was
his
acknowledgement
of
course
that
the
execution
of
a
closed
shop
contract
is
an
unfair
labor
practice,
clearly
an
labor
practice
but
at
the
same
time
he
would
not
commit
the
federal
government
to
force
it,
but
it
would
be
left
to
the
states.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
well
in
that
case
and
of
course
you
would
have,
you
would
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
as
to
whether
in
fact
it
is
a
closed
shop,
you
would
have
contrary
findings
of
fact,
you
would
have
all
the
i
am
sorry
if
i
am
misunderstood
mr.
solicitor,
you
would
have
all
the
mischief
which
congress
has
--
which
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
more
20
preemption
cases.
the
solicitor
relies
on
the
legislative
history,
but
where
in
the
legislative
history
can
he
find
what
he
acknowledges
to
be
a
correct
rule
of
law
that
the
states
cannot
interfere
with
strikes
or
picketing
or
other
activities
seeking
to
obtain
a
closed
shop
or
a
union
shop.
if
one
were
to
take
his
legislative
history
this
would
indicate
of
course
that
curry
is
wrong
and
finds
within
chambers
is
wrong.
you
cannot
rely
on
these
broad
generalities
thing.
indeed
contrary
to
the
suggestion
contained
in
the
solicitor's
brief
curry
and
farnsworth
and
chambers
were
extensively
briefed.
the
very
same
arguments
that
the
solicitor
has
made,
the
very
same
reliant
on
the
legislative
history
were
before
this
court
when
it
curry
and
farnsworth
&
chambers.
now
i
think
that
the
best
one
can
do
relative
to
legislative
history
i
think
is
to
refer
to
the
distinguished
solicitor's
article
in
the
harvard
law
review
in
which
he
says
it
is
folly
to
search
for
straw
and
statute
a
legislative
history
suppose
to
point
to
what
went
on
the
minds
of
an
imaginary
congressman,
deliberating
on
a
question
that
no
one
actually
considered.
problems
of
federalism
ought
to
be
decided
upon
explicit
considerations
of
the
factors
entering
into
a
determination
of
policy,
viewed
from
the
standpoint
of
one
sympathetic
to
the
national
labor
policy
embodied
in
existing
legislation.
the
practice
would
not
only
lead
to
sounder
solutions
but
would
also
encourage
discussion
helpful
to
the
court
in
future
decisions
and
leading
to
a
more
informed
opinion
legislative
review.
of
course
this
was
professor
cox
talking
and
not
the
solicitor
of
united
states.
referring
to
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
i
imagine
itself
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
the
solicitor's
reliance
upon
section
13
of
the
house
bill,
it's
quite
true,
section
13
of
the
house
bill
attempted
to
establish
some
concurrence
jurisdiction,
but
the
important
thing
about
it
is
that
it
was
never
accepted
in
conference.
it
was
completely
rewritten
with
a
completely
different
intent.
what
emerged
is
14
(b)
which
definitely
ties
in
to
8
(a)
(3)
because
it
says
nothing
in
this
act
shall
authorize
the
execution
or
application
of
a
contract
which
is
violative
of
state
policy.
now
this
in
the
strongest
measure
relates
14
(b)
to
8
(a)
(3)
and
it
seems
inconceivable
that
congress
would
have
told
the
states
that
you
could
outlaw
this
as
a
matter
of
substance
of
law
and
then
say
that
this
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
i
think
i
have
demonstrated
in
my
argument,
my
opening
argument
of
the
relationship
between
section
14
(b)
and
8
(a)
(3).
i
believe
the
brief
of
the
government
acknowledges
that
this
is
a
warranted
interpretation.
you
will
find
nothing
in
the
brief
which
would
anyway
militates
against
their
point
of
view.
so
summarizing
let
me
say,
one,
i
believe
the
execution
of
any
union
security
agreement
violative
of
state
law
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
congress
met
to
integrate
that
into
8
(a)
(3)
and
that
is
much
a
proviso
of
8
(a)
(3)
as
every
other
provision.
beyond
this
you
will
not
find
a
single
word
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
had
any
kinds
of
awareness
or
consideration
to
permitting
punitive
state
power.
indeed
it
is
not
have
to
appear
there
because
the
intent
of
14
(b)
was
to
integrate
it
in
to
8
(a)
(3)
and
8
(a)
(3)
of
course
provides
the
cease
and
desist
orders.
i
therefore
submit
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
no
because
8
(a)
(3)
in
this
language
would
(inaudible)
because
14
(b)
in
this
language
refers
explicitly
to
14
(b)
--
let
me
start
again
because
14
(b)
in
this
language
explicitly
refers
to
8
(a)
(3)
and
to
section
7.
section
7
says
that
employee
shall
be
free
from
any
(inaudible)
except
where
authorized
8
(a)
(3).
actually
there
was
another
section
called
8
(b)
(4)
of
the
house
bill.
that
section
specifically
say
this
that
would
it
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
it
was
so
held
and
that's
referred
to
in
the
briefs
sir,
but
the
senate
recognizing
the
mischief
which
is
the
house
was
up
to
and
conference
would
have
anything
of
this
and
they
rewrote
section
14
(b)
and
rewrote
section
8
(b)
(4)
into
what
is
now
section
8
(a)
(3)
and
it
therefore
seems
to
me
that
the
legislative
history
as
a
whole
demonstrates
what
i
think
is
clear
in
the
report
which
the
house
made
following
the
meetings
in
the
conference.
in
the
house
report
following
the
conference
there
isn't
any
reference
any
longer
to
any
concurrent
jurisdiction.
the
only
reference
you
find
there
is
that
we
have
made
sure
that
the
labor
board
administering
8
(a)
(3)
and
the
proviso
of
8
(a)
(3)
would
not
permit
any
kind
of
shop
arrangement
where
we
outlawed
it
in
our
states
and
this
is
the
total
effect.
what
we
proposed
gentlemen
is
a
simple
system,
which
work
well
because
all
the
board
has
to
do
is
to
consider
this
as
part
of
the
substantive
law
then
you
will
have
one
agency
administering
the
law
in
every
state,
it
received
uniform
interpretation.
it
is
not
dependent
upon
hundreds
of
different
judges
sitting
throughout
our
land.
your
penalties
and
your
remedies
will
be
equal.
you
will
have
sound
administration
and
you
will
be
able
to
carry
out
intent
of
a
state
where
they
say
that
a
union
shop
is
against
the
policy.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
if
i
am
wrong
that
this
is
an
unfair
labor
practice,
then
i
believe
that
the
entire
area
involved
because
there
are
radiations
in
administrations
which
will
inevitably
interfere
with
the
administration
by
the
board.
i
will
recognize
though
that
i
am
wrong
in
my
argument
the
basic
platform
upon
which
i
rest
was
false.
my
argument
is
that
this
is
a
matter
of
labor
board
concern,
of
congressional
concern
and
that
whether
as
a
matter
of
remedy
or
as
a
matter
of
administration
you
cannot
deal
with
union
security
matters.
you
cannot
deal
with
these
matters
and
not
impinge
and
if
i
am
wrong
in
my
argument
sir
i
think
that
perhaps
it
would
raise
great
question
as
to
the
correctness
of
curry
and
farnsworth
and
i
believe
those
decisions
to
be
eminently
correct
because
they
proceed
on
the
analysis
that
to
attempt
to
obtain
a
closed
shop
constitutes
an
unfair
labor
practice.
contrary
to
my
opponent
i
believe
that
the
curry
case
is
pretty
clear.
this
court
adopted
the
findings
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
to
the
affect
of
the
purpose
of
the
union
was
to
obtain
a
closed
shop.
there
was
any
organization
problem
involved
there.
it
wasn't
any
question
of
unionization
as
such.
it
was
a
naked
effort
to
obtain
a
closed
shop
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
yes.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
but
the
court
itself
does
not
--
but
the
court
itself
did
not
focus
on
a
closed
shop
but
set
forth
the
entirely
these
sections
and
recognized
that
this
thing
is
arguably
an
unfair
practice
under
any
of
the
provision
of
section
8
(a)
(b),
no
state
(inaudible).
it
seems
to
me
that
the
results
of
curry
and
farnsworth
really
control
the
disposition
of
this
case
as
i
think
it
was
acknowledged
by
the
solicitor
in
its
footnote
because
he
said
that
if
curry
and
farnsworth
were
correctly
decided
then
it
was
clear
that
a
closed
shop
was
unfair
labor
practice
and
the
states
would
have
not
any
authority.
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
i
believe
it
is
found
sir
on
page
37
and
38
referring
to
the
--
mr.
s.
g.
lippman
yes
sir
that's
the
one.
for
all
the
reasons
stated
i
believe
this
court
should
enter
a
degree
making
the
findings
that
while
a
state
has
a
power
to
declare
the
substantive
law
pursuant
to
a
grant
of
congress
the
matter
must
be
administered
and
remedies
granted
pursuant
to
the
provision
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
