suppose
14
(b)
had
never
been
adopted
what
would
you
say
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
preempted
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
you
say
about
the
legality
of
the
agreement
as
far
as
federal
law
is
concerned
--
[inaudible]
had
not
been
adopted
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
are
making
service
free
arrangement
with
the
employer
that
might
be
one
thing,
making
a
service
fee
employment
for
employee
who
do
not
belong
your
union
might
be
another.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
is
to
be
paid
by
the
employee
who
does
not
want
to
pay
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
us
assume
as
i
understand
your
challenges,
the
challenges
on
the
basis
of
this
statement
and
everything
else,
let
us
assume
they
had
provided
in
the
contract
that
they
must
pay
the
cost
of
collective
bargaining
when
they
are
representing
it
and
they
had
figured
out
from
last
year
[inaudible]
was
so
much
that
they
would
be
required
to
pay
that
as
a
fee
only
for
collective
bargaining,
what
would
you
say
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
the
argument
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
have
any
relevance
to
the
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
your
position
that
get
the
issues
a
little
more
confused
than
they
have
been,
what
was
the
--
you
have
a
situation
where
its
agreed
that
congress
has
selected
for
its
own
purpose
one
reason,
the
majority
of
unions,
if
they
are
majority
that
represent
all
the
employees
as
bargaining
agents.
i
suppose
there
was
a
--
figured
out
exactly
what
the
cost
of
that
bargaining
union
would
be
and
that
would
you
say
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
did
not
approve
such
a
provision
on
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
pursuing
this
inquiry
for
this
reason,
there
is
a
question
of
preemption.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
are
wrong
with
reference
to
the
fact
that
your
argument,
that
such
an
agreement
could
be
held
valid
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
by
the
national
labor
relations
board,
that
would
be
a
serious,
more
serious
question
here
of
preemption
that
you
have
assumed,
would
there
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
one
of
the
questions
raised.
justice
hugo
l.
black
my
question
is
mainly
this.
it's
doesn't
make
it
what
they
call
this
or
what
you
call
it,
if
it's
within
the
ambit
of
what
the
board
will
have
jurisdiction
to
determine
is
a
valid
arrangement,
i
would
assume
that
its
pretty
well
settled
by
some
of
our
cases
that
they
would
be
ones
that
pass
on
the
bona
fide
of
the
claim
and
as
to
the
service
fee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
agree
to
that.
we
are
bound
by
what
the
state
of
florida
says
this
does
insofar
as
florida
is
concerned,
but
not
insofar
as
the
powers
of
the
national
labor
relations
are
concerned
in
connection
with
the
scope
that
florida
gives
this
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
were,
suppose
it
were.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
florida
had
attempted
to
forbid
a
service
fee
arrangement
and
suppose
it
would
be
held
that
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
power,
the
[inaudible]
of
the
kind
is
in
the
board,
what
would
go
with
your
florida
act
in
that
respect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
does,
suppose
it
comes
within
the
prescription
of
that
--
proscription
of
that
constitutional
provision,
but
comes
within
the
allowable
limits
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
to
approve
it
is
right,
what
would
you
say
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
award
damages?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
accounting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
thought
ordinarily
--
maybe
it's
not
true
in
florida
and
i
am
not
sure
how
much
(inaudible)
has
but
i
thought
ordinarily
court
of
chancery
could
award
damages.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
(inaudible)
couldn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
it
could
give
such
damages
that
are
ordinarily
given
for
bringing
about
an
unlawful
discharge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
fact
he
said
it
is
here
so
far
it
has
any
value,
that
you
could
give
--
court
could
award
damages,
would
that
be
in
addition
to
what
the
labor
board
could
award?
justice
hugo
l.
black
ordinarily
or
–
justice
hugo
l.
black
though
do
not
ordinarily
completely
coincide,
i
don't
know
the
materiality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
again
for
whatever
it
maybe
worth
that
the
--
the
argument
that
he
makes
is
if
you
could
(inaudible)
other
states
could
if
your
position
of
the
law
is
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
could
send
them
to
the
chain
gang
if
that's
a
one
method
of
punishment
or
could
punish
him
criminally.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
is
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
argument,
but
i
didn't
understand
--
you
are
trying
to
answer
with
the
impression
that
states
couldn't
do
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
wouldn't
be
any
answer
to
it,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
so
that
issue
is
in
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
involved
at
all
in
hill
against
florida?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
it
or
not
involve
--
i
haven't
looked
at
it
recently
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
did
it
or
not
involve
an
insistence
that
florida
punish
a
man
in
a
way
for
doing
something
which
national
labor
relations
act
had
not
authorized
to
be
done
and
was
that
based
on
a
holding
that
in
failing
to
go
any
further
than
it
did,
congress
had
barred
the
states,
and
was
that
not
the
same
issue
that's
been
presented
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
whether
it
involved
that
right-to-work
law
or
not,
it
involved
the
principle,
did
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
act
was
construed
to
saying
that
the
court
--
congress
went
this
far
it
intended
to
go
no
further
and
all
i
am
asking
is
to
see
if
that
same
thing,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
met
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
congress
had
by
its
act
intended
that
the
remedy
it
afforded
was
all
that
could
be
voted
because
the
state
had
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
is
basically
the
issue
we
have
here
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
is
your
position
--
is
this
as
i
--
maybe
it's
right,
i
am
asking
for
information.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
act
was
passed,
it
provided
a
way
that
we
are
assuming
that
this
is
an
unfair
labor
practice,
i
understood
that
your
–
that
it
provided
a
way
that
this
should
be
stopped
by
administrative
agents
of
the
government
as
an
unfair
labor
practice.
it
went
no
further
to
provide
any
further
punishment
or
to
add
anything
else
that
could
be
done.
so
you
position
is
that
having
done
nothing
else,
it
didn't
intend,
it
did
not
intend
what
it
had
provided
to
be
all
that
could
be
done,
but
it
left
it
open
to
the
states
to
add
punishment
to
what
could
be
done
in
the
way
of
an
injunction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
me
hasten
the
directive
saying
it
as,
and
my
question
assumed
probably
my
language
lead
you
to
believe,
that
they
did
intent
that,
but
suppose
the
congress
did
provide
this
and
that
was
all
that
the
act
was
intended
to
be
done
in
case
of
what
was
done
here,
what
would
you
say
then
about
the
florida
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
intended
to
make
--
words
sometimes
are
confusing,
let's
forgot
preempt.
if
it
intended,
we've
fill
out
here
a
full
and
complete
remedy,
we
are
entitled
to
be
enjoined
and
the
board
can
give
them
back
pay
or
whatever
it
is
and
it
intended
that
to
be
all
it
should
be
done
in
those
cases
could
a
state
come
along
and
add
a
punishment
to
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that's
our
issue
here,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
case
was
that
that
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
average
time
for
an
equity
case
before
the
–
florida
first
court
and
second
court,
third
court,
and
maybe
up
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
federal
question,
they'd
have
right
to
come
up
here
wouldn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
assume
to
say
that
i
am
afraid
that
your
argument
about
delay
is
one
and
the
other
is
relevant,
quite
relevant
because
everybody
knows
the
courts
are
rather
slow
particularly
in
equity
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
not
take
longer
than
three
years.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
there
couldn't
be
much
difference,
courts
are
rather
(inaudible)
slow
many
times.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
of
which
section?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
say
anything
about
sanctions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
there
is
anything
specially
said
with
reference
to
the
right
of
the
state
to
punish
or
to
do
something
to
people
who
violate
that
provision
except
what
you
are
quoting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
nobody
mention
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
mention
in
hill
versus
florida
and
say
they
want
to
elude
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
is
it
clear
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
there
any
statement
to
that
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
talking
about
general
and
abstract
statements?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
first
mentioned
of
it--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
find
it
difficult
from
that
language,
because
there
is
maybe
this
other
as
far
as
asking
if
there
is
anymore,
besides
the
general
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
authorize
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
think
we
sustained
that
in
two
cases
in
this
court,
the
right
of
the
state
have
such
a
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
we,
did
we
sustain
the
right
in
the
one
from
nebraska
the
other
where
the
state
imposed
a
different
kind
of
punishment,
i
don't
recall.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible),
i
don't
get
there,
that's
where
i'm
stuck
on
your
argument.
why
does
it
follow
if
they
wanted
to
permit
the
state
to
outlaw
this
kind
of
contract
they
also
wanted
them
to
ask
to
the
sanctions
against
it
which
the
congress
has
provided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
when
the
congress
has
no
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
either
outlaws
it
provide
the
particular
punishment
against
those
who
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
congress,
suppose
if
they
prepare
a
law
of
making
it
a
crime,
to
violation
of
provision
do
the
interstate
commerce
act,
what
would
think?
they
had
provided
our
own
sanctions
of
the
committee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
say
this,
you
say
an
express
declaration.
i
simply
in
order
to
understand
by
not
asking
you
about
it,
i
do
not
understand
that
and
i
cannot
possibly
read
section
14
(b)
to
be
an
express
declaration
that
they
can
had
punishment
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
from
that
that
you
mean
that
the
congressional
act
itself
would
not
authorize
the
labor
board
to
do
something
to
somebody
who
made
one
of
these
contracts
in
violation
of
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
had
thought
maybe
i'm
wrong,
this
court
has
said
a
number
of
times
that
where
federal
government
does
something
making
it
an
offense,
we
will
certainly
not
strain
ourselves
to
find
that
the
state
can
make
the
same
thing
another
offence
whatever
we
might
decide
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
i
may
say
that
again
when
you
use
my
sentence
it
shows
we
cannot
ever
confine
the
power
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
restrict
our
views.
i
would
think
even
now
retroactively
speaking
and
when
i
say
the
court
put
policies
it
meant
that
they
didn't
intend
them
keep
them
from
having
a
closed-shop
law.
i
wouldn't
think
that
implied
that
could
add
punishments
to
the
government
(inaudible).
i
would
divide
the
two
into
separate
segments
in
connection
with
consideration
of
what
the
state
could
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
are
wrong
in
your
argument
that
this
is
not
bad
labor
practice,
what's
your
argument
then?
