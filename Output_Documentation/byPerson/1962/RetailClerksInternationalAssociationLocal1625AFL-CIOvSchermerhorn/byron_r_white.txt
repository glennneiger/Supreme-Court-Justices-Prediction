justice
byron
r.
white
which
i
suppose
leads
to
objective
employee
pay
a
greater
proportion
of
the
collective
bargaining
costs?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he's
going
to
be
paying
monthly
the
same
dues,
the
same
amount?
i
mean,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that's
one
of
his
--
that
was
true
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
are
talking
about
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
conduct
certainly
have
been
unfair
labor
practice
in
that
attempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
about
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
under
the
state
law.
do
you
think
there
is
any
doubt
in
this
case
that
this
kind
of
arrangement
is
barred
by
the
florida
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
conceded
it
in
moving
to
dismiss.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
for
the
purpose
of
your
motion
to
dismiss
it.
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lippman
you
said
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
indicating
what
the
amount
of
these
payments
were
to
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
are
i
suppose
free
to
consider
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
which
you
didn't
controvert
in
this
respect
as
to
--
that
these
payments
would
be
equivalent
to
initiation
fees
and
monthly
dues.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
we
can
accept
those
facts
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
there's
nothing
in
the
record
either
way
on
that,
whether
the
union
spent
--
they
did
or
did
not
spend
any
money
for
other
than
collective
bargaining.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
do
establish
that
the
member
and
the
non-members
in
equivalent
position
insofar
as
his
–
the
financial
charge
to
him
is
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
may
mean
that
this
is
even
more
burdensome
than
the
union
shop,
i
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
event,
the
same
money
comes
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
member
and
the
non-member.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
that's
all.
that
was
my
only
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
algoma
was
after
that,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
algoma
treated
as
the
same
of
that
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
state
could
continue
under
the
taft-hartley
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
what
is
in
practice
that
is
involved
in
algoma,
wouldn't
that
under
your
argument
amount
to
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
your
argument
wouldn't
the
state
be
powerless
to
remedy
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
opposite
result
that
was
indicated
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said
few
minutes
ago
that
the
same
practice
would
be
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
after
taft-hartley.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
it
hard
to
say
but
that
was
what
congress
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
said
–
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
good
argument
against
the
congress
and
anything
within
the
state
realm.
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
they
--
under
the
wagner
act
when
there
are
all
cease
and
desist
orders?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
at
the
same
time
a
state
could
put
people
in
jail
for
actually
getting
a
closed-shop
agreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
many
laws
were
there
during
that
period?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what
the,
how
do
you,
how
do
you
handle
the
curry
case
(inaudible)
picketing
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
allegation
was,
the
allegation
was
that
if
picketing
was
aimed
at
getting
the
employer
to
have
to
hire
only
union
labors.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
kind
of
thing
i
understood
you
say
the
florida
court
would
enjoin?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
the
union,
if
the
union
were
insisting
on
bargaining
for
an
agency
shop
in
a
right
to
work
state
like
florida
why
wouldn't
that
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
on
part
of
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
by
adding
an
additional
--
