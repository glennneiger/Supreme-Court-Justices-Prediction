justice
john
m.
harlan
did
any
case
come
before
or
after?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
may
be
i'm
confused,
wasn't
the
request
made
to
the
production
of
these
witnesses?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that's
all
there
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
is
the
government's
position
that
if
they
requested
the
names
and
he
wanted
these
witnesses
to
testify
on
cross-examination
purposes
it
would
–
should
have
been
granted,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you're
not
--
you're
saying
number
one,
as
i
get
it,
that
the
regulations
don't
give
this
man
a
right
to
require
the
government
to
call
a
witness
for
his
own
case,
if
they
don't
want
to
call.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
a
fortiori
not
arguing
that
if
it
chooses
to
hear
the
affidavits
that
they
then
can't
say,
“well,
since
we
haven't
produced
any
witness,
we
don't
have
to
produce
these
fellows
to
the
cross-examination.”
you're
not
taking
that
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
guess
my
question
is
rhetorical
so
it's
late,
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
trouble
is
this
is
ambiguous.
it
says
their
presence
was
requested
have
been
requested
though
--
i
suppose
mr.
pollak
would
say
to
that
is
that
refers
to
the
request
previously
on,
i
don't
remember
that
page
is
that
have
been
made
for
the
government
to
call
him
as
part
of
the
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
the
fact?
did
you
asked
the
air
force
to
bring
these
people
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
two
gentlemen
seem
to
be
and
head
on
collision
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
pollak
says
that
a
request
had
been
made
to
the
air
force,
these
men
did
not
appear,
the
government
wouldn't
be
here
which
is
just
exactly
what
i
expect
to
solicitor
general's
office
to
say.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
say
on
the
contrary
that
there
was
a
request
made
and
you
couldn't
get
him?
justice
john
m.
harlan
-
(voice
overlap)
read
the
whole
record
it
sounds
off
[inaudible]
to
me
because
i
can't
imagine
mr.
pollak
getting
up
in
making
the
statement
of
that
kind
that
he
thought
the
record
can
be
[inaudible]
