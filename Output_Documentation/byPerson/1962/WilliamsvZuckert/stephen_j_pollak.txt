mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
was
a
civilian
employee
of
the
air
force
employed
as
a
recreation
supervisor
at
the
air
force
academy
in
colorado
springs.
he
was
removed
after
proceedings
before
the
air
force
and
on
appeal
before
the
civil
service
commission,
proceedings
which
upheld
the
charges
that
he
had
committed
homosexual
assaults
on
three
named
airmen.
these
charges
which
are
set
forth
at
pages
16
and
17
of
the
record
provided
petitioner
with
the
names,
dates,
and
places
of
the
alleged
assaults.
the
subjects
of
the
assaults,
the
accusers
were
known
to
the
petitioner,
but
he
did
not
call
them
to
the
hearings
nor
did
the
air
force
call
them,
the
record
consisted
of
affidavits.
the
issues
in
the
government's
view
here
is
not
whether
an
employee
can
be
denied
an
opportunity
to
confront
and
cross-examine
his
accusers
for
we
believe
there
was
no
such
denial
here
rather
we
believe
the
issue
is
whether
a
government
employee
under
the
veterans
preference
act
and
the
regulations
must
make
his
own
arrangements
for
the
appearance
of
witnesses
whom
he
may
wish
to
examine
or
cross-examine.
we
believe
the
regulations
are
clear,
that
this
obligation
was
placed
on
the
employee
and
more
so
had
he
done
so
that
he
would've
been
afforded
his
full
rights
of
examination.
we
do
not
believe
there
is
any
basis
in
this
record
for
a
contention
that
the
witnesses
would
not
have
agreed
to
appear
or
that
the
air
force
would've
precluded
their
appearance.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
at
the
proceedings
before
the
civil
service
commission,
the
proceedings
on
appeal
mr.
justice
harlan
at
page
44
of
the
record,
the
attorney,
the
counsel
for
mr.
williams
asked
the
air
force
or
one
of
the
air
force
representatives
at
that
proceeding,
mrs.
dillon,
a
personnel
officer
whether
three
named
airmen
were
available
for
attendance
at
the
hearing
as
witnesses
and
if
so,
why
they
had
not
been
brought.
mrs.
dillon
responded
that
the
--
that
two
of
the
men
were
stationed
at
the
academy,
colorado
springs
which
was
some
68
miles
from
the
location
of
the
hearing
and
that
the
air
force
saw
no
need
for
their
presence
and
did
not
believe
that
they
would
be
able
to
add
anything
and
had
not
called
them
as
its
witnesses.
we
believe
that
this
request
here
was
a
request
that
the
air
force
produce
these
men
as
its
affirmative
case
witnesses.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
all
there
is.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
in
our
judgment,
yes.
further,
a
review
of
the
contentions
before
the
board
of
appeals
and
review,
i
believe
indicates
that
that
is
petitioner's
contention.
moreover,
in
a
later
response
in
the
board
of
appeals
and
review
proceedings,
the
air
force
representative,
the
personnel
officer
stated
that
there
was,
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
85
of
the
record,
“that
there
was
no
design
or
intent
upon
--
on
the
part
of
any
official
of
the
air
force
to
preclude
mr.
williams
from
such
opportunity”
that
is
the
cross-examination
or
having
the
witnesses.
as
i
will
indicate
in
the
moment,
the
regulations
are
clear
that
each
side
is
to
make
arrangements
for
its
witnesses.
these
regulations
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
of
the
government's
brief
and
the
air
force
was
proceeding
on
that
basis.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
is
the
government's
position
that
he
asked
these
witnesses
to
appear
in
accordance
with
the
air
force
policy,
the
air
force
would've
permitted
and
in
fact
assisted
the
witness
to
appear.
i
refer
to
the
regulations
which
are
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
regulation
804.403,
that
is
in
the
32
c.f.r.,
air
force
regulations
which
states
that
it
is
the
policy
of
the
department
of
the
air
force
to
make
official
information
available
for
use
in
litigation
and
to
permit
military
and
civilian
personnel
to
testify
concerning
such
information
in
its
files
if
material
and
relevant
to
litigation.
and
that
had
the
petitioner
and
his
lawyer
only
addressed
their
request
to
these
witnesses
or
a
request
to
the
staff
judge
advocate
who
was
located
on
the
air
force
academy
grounds
that
in
accordance
for
these
regulations,
the
witnesses
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
they
would
have
agreed
or
disagreed,
the
individuals,
but
the
air
force
would've
permitted
them
to
testify
and
i
think
in
accordance
with
its
policy
would've
encouraged
them
to
do
so.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
might
i
respond
to
that
in
two
ways.
first,
counsel
for
mr.
williams
here
has
cited
the
regulation
05.3
and
advised
me
yesterday
that
he
would
do
so.
in
reviewing
that
regulation,
i
find
that
it
does
not
apply
to
members
of
the
military.
members
of
the
military
are
excluded
from
that
power
of
the
commission
by
a
just
immediately
prior
regulation
01.1
which
states
that
the
rules
in
this
sub-chapter
apply
to
all
positions
in
the
competitive
service.
so
that
i
cannot
respond
to
your
question
by
saying
that
the
commission
could
have
ordered
their
appearance
under
05.3
because
it
does
not
have
that
power
over
members
of
the
military.
whether
the
--
a
request
then
to
the
examiner,
civil
service
examiner
should
have
brought
forth
an
order
then
whatever
power
it
had
that
they
appear,
i'm
not
sure
how
it
would
develop
since
it's
--
since
none
of
these
steps
were
taken.
but
certainly,
had
the
witnesses
refused
to
appear,
had
the
attorney
for
mr.
williams
contacted
the
air
force
and
asked
the
air
force
to
urge
them
to
appear,
had
he
asked
the
examiner,
none
of
these
he
did,
had
he
asked
the
examiner
to
order
the
witnesses
to
appear,
had
he
asked
the
examiner
to
strike
the
affidavit,
if
they
did
not
appear,
any
one
of
those
steps
were
open
to
this
petitioner
and
he
and
his
counsel
did
not
take
it.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
if
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no.
well,
your
honor,
this
is
a
summary
of
the
proceedings
prepared
by
the
examiner
and
given
the
counsel
for
each
party
and
we
can
only
read
that
in
the
light
of
what
is
here.
and
we
read
it
to
mean
that
the
request
was
that
the
air
force
produce
these
witnesses
as
part
of
its
affirmative
live
case
and
that
that
request
was
denied.
we
read
it
to
mean
that
the
petitioner
wanted
the
air
force
to
arrange
for
their
appearance
as
its
witnesses
and
we
read
no
more
into
it.
the
complaint
of
the
petitioner
as
indicated
a
little
bit
thereafter
on
pages
47
and
48
was
that
he
had
had
no
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
witnesses
on
whose
statement
to
the
air
force
is
relying
on.
i
don't
believe
that
he
was
contending
that
the
air
force
was
there
refusing
a
request
for
him
to
call
them
as
his
witnesses
by
him.
for
example
he
made
no
objection
to
the
proceedings
taken
place
on
affidavits.
he
did
not
suggest
that
the
air
force
affidavits
which
were
part
of
the
record
before
the
examiner
that
should
be
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
is
the
government's
position
that
the
regulations
here
afford
cross-examination
of
witnesses
to
either
party
brings
to
the
hearing
and
that
had
he
asked
these
witnesses
to
appear
and
they
appeared
why
certainly
he
is
entitled
to
cross-examination.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
think
they
--
i'm
not
certain
that
the
government
would
be
here
and
let
me
state
this
case.
if
you're
suggesting
that
he
had
--
had
he
asked
them
to
come
that
they
refused
and
he
addressed
to
request
to
the
staff
judge
advocate
that
staff
judge
advocate
concededly
--
and
let
them
to
come
with
--
they
were
saying,
well
we
can't
come
because
the
air
force
says
no
and
had
the
air
force
declined
to
permit
them.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
which
stems
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
--
which
stems
from
the
lack
of
a
subpoena.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
on
the
basis
of
the
affidavits
of
men
who
refused
to
appear
and
who
could
not
be
ordered.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
regulation
supports
cross-examination
of
witnesses.
i
don't
think
that
that
would
come
within
the
regulation
and
i
believe
that
would
present
a
more
serious
question
such
as
order
of
this
court
based
in
green
and
the
mcelroy
or
possibly
in
some
of
the
considerations
which
were
present
in
the
vitarelli.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
don't
think
that
question
is
presented
here.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
is
our
position.
i
believe
that
is
the
case
presented
on
this
record.
i
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
even
though,
that's
right,
that
the
government
may
present
its
case
on
affidavit
and
that
he
is
not
to
direct
his
request
to
the
government
to
present
a
live
case
but
rather
to
bring
the
witnesses
in
and
in
accordance
with
the
regulations
which
make
this
an
informal
proceeding
where
the
rules
of
evidence
are
not
strictly
enforced
where
a
verbatim
transcript
need
not
be
necessary.
he
may
cross-examine
them,
he
may
bring
them
in,
call
them
and
then
proceed
to
cross-examine.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
is
--
yes,
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right.
the
regulation
provides
and
has
provided
since
the
act
was
passed
in
1944
and
the
regulations
were
issued
in
november
of
1944
that
the
employee
and
his
designated
representative
and
the
employing
agency
must
make
their
own
arrangements
for
the
appearance
of
witnesses.
and
the
interpretation
of
that
regulation
has
been
consistent
that
each
side
must
if
it
wishes
live
witnesses
it
must
bring
them
to
the
hearing.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
i
believe
you've
correctly
stated
what
our
position
is,
yes
and
here,
he
did
not
do
so
as
we
read
this
record.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
case
that
isn't
here
is
where
he
tries
to
make
his
own
arrangements
and
the
witnesses
themselves
say,
“no,
we
won't
come
--”
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
or
the
government
obstructs
it,
yes,
and
we
state
that
had
he
only
tried,
the
air
force
regulations
would
have
required
the
air
force
to
permit
them
to
come
and
to
assist
in
their
coming.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no.
this
light
went
on
and
i
--
if
they
only
meant
that
i
didn't
(voice
overlap)
second
question
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
wanted
to
mention
one
other
factor
of
proceeding.
following
a
proceeding
before
the
air
force
which
the
petitioner
chose
not
to
make
personal
appearance,
he
was
advised
of
his
right
to
make
an
immediate
appeal
or
to
seek
grievance
proceedings
before
an
air
force
grievance
committee.
he
chose
with
counsel
to
take
an
immediate
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission
and
that
is
the
proceeding
which
is
the
issue
here.
had
he
chosen
to
go
first
to
the
grievance
committee,
the
air
force
regulation
which
is
cited
in
this
letter
advising
him
that
he
might
seek
provide
that
at
that
hearing,
he
might
list
witnesses
whom
he
wish
and
that
the
air
force
grievance
committee
would
order
their
appearance
that
had
he
availed
himself
of
this
right
to
seek
grievance
proceeding
for
the
air
force,
the
confrontation
and
cross-examination
which
he
is
complaining
here
or
lack
of
it
on
the
appeal
would
have
been
afforded
in
proceedings
before
the
air
force
under
air
force
regulations.
these
regulations
appear
in
the
air
force
manual
40-1
of
public
regulation.
we
believe
that
here,
the
--
there
--
we
recognize
there
was
no
cross-examination
or
confrontation.
what
we
believe
is
that
it
was
the
fault
of
the
petitioner
that
had
he
sought
to
ask
for
these
men
to
appear,
had
he
sought
to
ask
the
examiner
to
give
him
a
continuance
to
ask
them,
had
he
sought
to
ask
that
the
affidavit
to
be
struck
for
in
any
other
way
to
avail
himself
of
a
right
to
cross-examination,
it
would've
been
procured
or
at
least
an
issue
farther
from
that
which
we're
confronted
here
have
been
raised.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
he
did.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice,
counsel
did
make
that
--
take
that
position.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
in
our
view,
these
witnesses
were
certainly
available
to
this
man.
he
was
represented
by
counsel
and
the
air
force
academy
is
an
open
base.
counsel
on
business
could
have
proceeded
to
find
the
witnesses
and
asked
them
to
appear.
the
petitioner
had
he
not
been
avail
himself
of
counsel,
because
he
have,
could
have
written,
telephoned,
telegraphed
as
indications
that
these
men,
the
witnesses
whom
he
was
seeking,
frequently
went
off
the
base,
the
record
shows
that
these
alleged
incidents
occurred
off
the
base
and
for
all
the
record
shows
they
may
have
lived
off
of
the
base.
we
think
that
petitioner's
right
to
access
to
these
men
was
very
clear.
he
had
no
difficulty
for
reaching
them.
had
he
really
wanted
them
a
communication
to
the
staff
judge
advocate
on
the
base
from
his
lawyer,
mr.
williams'
attorney
would've
--
we
think
had
gone
right
through.
there's
no
indication,
in
fact,
there
is
a
concession
which
is
reported
page
110
of
the
record
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
he
made
no
attempt
to
contact.
he
made
no
attempt
to
ask
them
to
come;
he
didn't
know
if
they
would
come.
i
would
like
only
briefly
to
reply
to
the
contention
that
the
veterans
preference
act
was
enacted
to
set
up
a
trial
type
hearing.
i
think
that
the
brief
shows
that
the
words
of
a
statute
which
state
that
the
employee
shall
have
a
right
to
make
a
personal
appearance.
the
legislative
history
and
really
all
the
other
pertinent
evidence
shows
that
the
statute
was
meant
to
give
a
right
of
personal
appearance
and
no
more.
might
i
just
say
that
i
believe
on
this
record,
we
must
assume
that
had
petitioner
asked
these
witnesses,
they
would've
attended
and
that
the
air
force
would've
given
its
permission.
the
remote
possibility
that
they
might
have
refuse,
that
the
air
force
would've
given
permission
is
not
present
here
because
petitioner
and
his
lawyer
never
asked.
we
respectfully
request
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below.
