justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

i
must
confess
i
didn't
think
there's
[inaudible]
can
i
just
sum
up
the
word,
what
is
the
government's
position,
is
it
that
--
is
there
any
premise
that
he
was
entitled
to
have
confrontation
here
or
is
it
the
government's
position
that
he's
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
is
it
the
government's
position
that
he
followed
the
regulation
and
had
not
been
able
to
get
them
to
appear
that
the
government
had
no
obligation
to
produce
witnesses.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i'm
not
thinking
to
that.
i
gather
what
you
just
said
is
that
there's
a
permission
on
that
part
of
the
witnesses
to
appear
or
not
as
the
witnesses.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
now,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
in
this,
if
that
had
happened
here,
there's
been
a
proper
request
whatever
regulations
provide
and
nevertheless
although
the
air
force
to
believe
that
let
them
come
you
said
no,
i
won't
come,
would
the
government
then
decide
that
you
nevertheless
have
proceeded
and
dismiss
him
as
he
was
dismissed
without
producing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
am
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
am
i
to
infer
then
from
your
answer
that
so
far
as
the
government's
concern
the
only
question
before
us
is
did
he
or
did
not
apparently
he
did
not
this
--
to
have
to
ask
for
those
witnesses
as
the
regulation
said
that
he
might
be
and
if
it's
the
fact
that
he
did
not
although
he
might
have
under
the
regulations
that
are
set
forth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
pollak
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
pollak,
is
that
the
key
to
your
position
that
he
would've
had
to
approach
those
witnesses
first
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
before
he
could
make
any
request
to
the
air
force
for
assistance
and
as
this
record
show
and
i
don't
because
as
i
told
you
i
haven't
read
it,
if
this
record
shows
that
there
was
a
request
to
the
air
force
it
was
a
request
without
first
going
to
the
witnesses
to
ask
them
as
they
be.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
position
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
now,
there
was
no
request
to
the
witnesses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
your
point
--
your
position
as
i
understand
that
without
a
request
for
the
witnesses
first
he
has
no
case
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
am
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
was
this
hearing?
