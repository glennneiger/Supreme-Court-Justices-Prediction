mr.
david
i.
shapiro
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
an
employee
with
veterans’
preference
status
can
be
denied
an
opportunity
to
confront
and
cross-examine
his
accusers
in
a
proceeding
before
the
civil
service
commission
challenging
his
removal
from
federal
employment.
the
employing
agency,
in
this
case,
the
air
force,
admitted
that
the
witnesses
to
petitioner's
alleged
misconduct
were
all
airmen,
on
active
duty
and
subject
to
which
military
control,
yet
it
refused
to
produce
them
before
the
civil
service
commission
because
if
the
air
force
unilaterally
concluded
that
their
testimony
would
not
have
aided
the
petitioner's
test.
now,
court
below
held
that
the
failure
of
the
air
force
to
produce
these
witnesses
did
not
violate
petitioner's
statutory
or
procedural
rights,
one
of
the
facts.
the
petitioner
was
a
veteran
with
16
years
government
service,
was
employed
as
a
recreational
supervisor
at
the
air
force
academy.
on
march
19,
1959,
he
was
suspended
from
employment
on
grounds
that
he
had
attempted
to
make
homosexual
assaults
upon
three
airmen
and
it
willfully
damaged
a
government
type.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes
sir
he
was.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes.
now,
two
of
the
attempted
assaults
were
alleged
to
have
occurred
while
the
petitioner
was
on
active
duty
with
the
air
force,
approximately
a
year
and
two
years
before.
the
third
attempt
was
alleged
to
have
occurred
while
he
was
employed
in
a
civilian
capacity
at
the
air
force
academy.
now,
prior
to
his
removal,
the
petitioner
was
notified
that
he
could
answer
the
charges
against
him
personally
and
in
writing.
however,
since
he
had
been
prohibited
the
day
before
from
entering
the
academy
grounds
on
pane
of
arrest,
he
did
not
avail
himself
of
his
so-called
“opportunity”
to
answer
the
charges
in
person,
but
did
so
in
writing
instead.
now
he
was,
after
he
replied
in
writing,
discharged
from
his
position
with
the
air
force
on
april
12,
1959.
he
then
appealed
to
the
civil
service
commission
under
section
14
of
veterans
preference
act.
on
may
5,
1959,
the
tenth
civil
service
region
held
a
hearing
to
take
evidence
of
petitioner's
misconduct.
now
at
the
outset
of
the
hearing,
the
petitioner
requested
the
department
of
the
air
force
for
an
opportunity
to
interrogate
three
airmen,
two
of
them
were
alleged
victims
of
this
homosexual
attempts
and
who
were
stationed
at
the
air
force
academy
but
this
requests
were
rejected.
the
air
force
submitted
its
evidence
against
the
petitioner
in
affidavit
form
and
while
admitting
its
ability
to
produce
all
three
airmen,
it
declined
to
do
so
on
the
grounds
at
the
hearing
that
the
air
force
academy
saw
no
need
for
their
attendance,
it
did
not
consider
that
they
would
be
able
to
add
anything
to
the
case.
they
later
explained
this
by
saying
that
if
they
had
appeared,
the
testimony
that
they
would've
offer
on
cross-examination
would
even
been
more
damaging
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
the
third
one
apparently
was
an
individual
who
was
present
there.
there
is
some
confusion
in
the
record.
they
were
actually
two
of
these
airmen
who
were
the
accusing
witnesses
that
he
requested.
the
third
was
apparently
an
individual,
another
airman
who
was
present
during
one
of
the
occurrences
and
i
think
the
government
states
that
fact
correctly
in
its
brief
with
regard
to
that
airman.
now,
as
i
said,
the
tenth
civil
service
region
upheld
the
refusal
of
the
air
force
to
produce
the
airmen
and
despite
the
petitioner's
denial
of
the
assaults
which
included
an
attack
on
the
credibility
of
these
accusers,
the
conflicts
and
evidence
according
to
the
tenth
civil
service
region
were
resolved
in
favor
of
the
air
force
and
petitioner's
removal
from
the
stand.
the
petitioner
appealed
to
the
board
of
appeals
and
review
of
the
civil
service
commission
which
affirmed
the
regional
director's
decision
on
his
rationale.
on
june
6,
1960,
the
petitioner
filed
the
complaint
in
united
states
district
court
on
cross
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint.
on
november
9,
1961,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
now,
we
contend
that
where
the
issue
on
a
veteran's
appeal
to
the
commission
turns
in
part
on
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
against
him
and
the
agency
admits
command
and
control
of
those
witnesses,
section
14
of
the
veterans
preference
act
and
the
applicable
civil
service
regulations
do
not
authorize
the
agency
to
refuse
to
produce
such
witnesses
at
the
hearing,
but
to
rely
in
their
affidavits
instead.
section
14
of
the
veterans
preference
act
of
1944,
although
it's
modeled
on
section
6
in
the
lloyd-la
follette
act
of
1912,
was
designed
to
provide
special
and
additional
preferences
for
war
veterans.
that
statute
eliminated
the
lloyd-la
follette
provision
making
cross-examination
of
witnesses,
trial
or
a
hearing
a
matter
for
the
discretion
of
the
removing
officer
and
substituted
in
its
place
an
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission
with
the
right
to
make
an
appearance
either
personally
or
by
representative.
and
here's
the
provision
which
was
excluded
from
the
veterans
preference
act
and
is
contained
in
the
lloyd-la
follette
act,
“no
examination
of
witnesses
nor
any
trial
or
hearing
shall
be
required
except
in
the
discretion
of
the
officer
directing
the
removal
or
suspension.”
as
i
say,
that
was
specifically
eliminated
from
the
veterans
preference
act
and
in
its
place
was
substituted
the
appeal
provisions
of
the
civil
service
commission.
now,
the
legislative
history
in
the
78th
congress
is
virtually
silent
as
to
the
meaning
of
section
14
appeal
provision,
but
the
legislative
history
of
that
provision
in
both
the
75th
and
76th
congresses
demonstrates,
we
think,
that
it
was
designed
to
provide
a
trial
type
hearing
on
the
appeal
to
the
commission.
legislative
representative
of
the
veterans
of
foreign
wars
testified
in
1937
and
pretty
much
the
same
way
again
in
1939
that,
“the
purpose
of
that
section
referring
to
what
became
section
14
as
apparent
is
to
prevent
any
man
from
being
let
out
without
good
cause
shown
and
he
would
be
let
out
only
after
a
proper
hearing.”
it
would
protect
veteran
from
being
discharged
for
shall
i
say
personal
reasons
and
on
the
other
hand
it
will
not
absolutely
prohibit
a
supervisory
officer
from
discharging
a
man
for
cause,
but
it
does
give
the
veteran
an
opportunity
to
defend
himself
by
trial.
now
your
honors,
almost
immediately
after
14
of
the
veterans
preference
act
was
enacted,
the
civil
service
commission
adopted
regulations
governing
employee
appeals.
these
regulations,
which
are
substantially
the
same
now
as
when
the
first
issued,
provide
pretty
much
as
follows.
first,
the
employee
has
a
right
to
appear
at
the
hearing
on
his
appeal.
the
agency
has
a
right
to
participate
in
such
hearing
and
both
parties
shall
have
the
right
to
produce
witnesses,
that's
22601.
two,
opportunity
will
be
afforded
for
the
introduction
of
evidence,
including
testimony
and
statements
by
the
employee
and
witnesses
and
by
representatives
of
the
agency
and
its
witnesses
and
for
the
cross-examination
of
witness,
that's
22603.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes
sir,
they
were.
third,
the
testimony
at
hearing
shall
be
uninterrupted.
now
the
court
below
following
its
earlier
decision
in
the
luévano
against
campbell
concluded
despite
these
regulations
that
in
as
much
as
22607
of
the
commission's
regulations
provided
that
the
commission
is
not
authorized
to
subpoena
witnesses
and
that
the
employee
and
the
agency
must
make
their
own
arrangements
for
the
appearance
of
witnesses,
the
failure
of
the
air
force
to
produce
its
witnesses
at
the
hearing
in
no
way
violated
the
petitioner's
rights.
now,
we
say
that
this
interpretation
of
22607
is
erroneous.
we
say
that
that
section
has
to
be
read
together
with
22601
which
provides
that
both
the
employee
and
the
agency
shall
have
the
right
to
participate
in
a
hearing
and
that
both
parties
shall
have
the
right
to
produce
witnesses.
when
so
read,
we
say
that
22607
means
that
since
the
commission
is
not
authorized
to
subpoena
witnesses,
the
employee
and
the
agency
must
make
their
own
arrangements
for
the
appearance
of
their
own
witnesses
because
otherwise,
the
regulations
providing
for
cross-examination
of
witnesses
and
requiring
that
the
testimony
at
the
hearing
should
be
under
oath
would
be
rendered
meaningless
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
since
the
luévano
against
campbell
they
have
it.
now,
the
government
argues,
first,
that
the
commission
has
always
interpreted
its
regulations
to
mean
that
the
employee
has
the
burden
of
persuading
the
agency's
witnesses
to
appear
and
testify
against
him
first
before
being
able
and
able
under
the
regulations
or
entitled
to
cross-examine.
and
second,
that
congress
by
reenacting
the
veterans
preference
act
in
1947
implicitly
accepted
and
ratified
this
so-called
interpretation
and
if
the
court
please,
the
only
thing
that
congress
had
before
it
in
1947
was
the
commission's
regulations
and
it
was
these
regulations,
the
ones
i've
just
quoted
here,
not
the
commission's
unreported
administrative
practice
under
them
which
congress
in
1947
implicitly
accepted
and
ratified.
because
in
fact,
the
commission's
interpretation
which
the
government
can
--
for
which
the
government
contends
was
an
unknown
prior
to
the
1952
decision
in
the
luévano
against
campbell,
which
this
court
declined
to
review
on
certiorari
and
which
we
say
was
wrongly
decided.
the
luévano
rule
makes
veterans
appeal
hearings
before
the
commission
where
both
parties
are
granted
the
right
under
these
regulations
to
produce
witnesses,
to
introduce
evidence,
to
cross-examine
witnesses
in
a
hearings
where
the
employee
submits
his
evidence
by
testifying
under
oath
and
subjecting
himself
to
cross-examination.
and
the
government
submits
its
witnesses
by
submitting
affidavits
and
you
cannot
cross-examine
an
affidavit.
now,
in
practical
effect,
what
has
happened
is
that
the
employee's
right
of
cross-examination
specifically
provided
for
in
22603
has
been
read
out
of
the
regulations
entirely.
i
say
employee
has
his
right
of
cross-examination,
but
the
government
still
retains
its
right
of
cross-examination.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that
is
correct.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
the
reason
for
that
was
that
he
had
hoped
to
make
his
case
through
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
that
did
not
appear
and
that's
why
at
the
outset
of
the
hearing
he
asked
the
air
force
to
produce
them.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
correct,
sir.
now,
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
they
were
the
government's
witnesses
that
he
had
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes
sir.
now,
the
government
suggests
that
this
problem
that
we
have
here
need
never
have
come
about
and
that
in
fact
the
witnesses
might
have
appeared
at
the
hearing
if
petitioner
had
only
taken
the
trouble
to
ask
them
to
appear.
but
this
suggestion
ignores
air
force
regulation
110-5
which
precludes
the
voluntary
appearance
of
air
force
personnel
at
such
hearings
absent
prior
consent
from
the
air
force.
the
fact
that
the
air
force
rejected
the
request
of
the
petitioner
that
such
witnesses
be
produced
and
the
fact
that
these
witnesses
were
stationed
at
the
air
force
academy
and
petitioner
have
been
prohibited
from
entering
the
academy's
grounds.
now,
the
government
attempts
to
make
much
of
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
no
subpoena
power
and
this
of
course
is
true,
but
section
05.3
of
the
commission's
rules,
that's
5
c.f.r.05.3,
which
unfortunately
is
not
set
forth
in
the
briefs,
specifically
provides,
“all
officers
and
employees
in
the
executive
branch
shall
give
to
the
commission
or
its
authorized
representatives,
all
information
and
testimony
in
regard
to
matters
inquired
of
arising
under
the
laws,
rules,
and
regulations
administered
by
the
commission.”
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
5
c.f.r.,
section
05.3,
in
vitarelli
versus
seaton
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
5
c.f.r.,
section
05.3
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
in
vitarelli
the
interior
department
had
no
subpoena
power
and
no
power
equivalent
to
that's
set
forth
in
05.3
of
the
commission's
rules.
yet,
in
that
case,
this
court
construed
a
department
of
interior
order
which
gave
the
employee
the
right
to
cross-examine
any
witness
offered
in
support
of
the
charges
as
requiring
the
interior
department
to
call
as
witnesses
at
the
hearing,
all
so-called
non-confidential
informants
who
supplied
information
against
the
employee
upon
which
the
agency
relied.
your
honors,
we
say
that
[inaudible]
is
controlling
in
this
case
and
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i'm
sorry
sir,
i
didn't
hear
your
question.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
before
sir,
1952.
vitarelli
was
decided
i
believe
in
1959.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i'd
like
to
read
from
page
47
of
the
record
if
i
may.
this
is
the
middle
paragraph.
at
this
time,
mr.
andrews
who's
the
counsel
for
petitioner
before
the
commission
again
made
a
point
of
the
fact
that
airmen,
ryan
and
tyler
are
assigned
to
duty
at
the
air
force
academy.
they
even
know
their
presence
had
been
requested
at
the
hearing
for
cross-examination,
the
air
force
had
failed
to
produce
them
as
witnesses.
counsel
for
the
appellant
contended
that
the
refusal
to
produce
these
airmen
as
witnesses
was
arbitrary
in
the
best
methods
of
full
supply
and
error.
again
on
page
48,
second
paragraph,
at
the
conclusion
of
mrs.
dillon's
remarks
on
behalf
of
the
department
of
the
air
force
counsel
for
the
appellants
initiated
the
summation
of
the
case
by
again
pointing
out
“that
there's
been
no
opportunity
to
cross-examine
the
witnesses
on
whose
statements
the
removal
action
have
been
taken
and
under
the
circumstances,
the
motives
of
these
witnesses
were
unknown.”
i
believe
that
should
put
to
rest
the
question
for
the
contention
that
there
has
been
no
request
to
the
air
force
that
these
witnesses
be
produced
for
cross-examination.
it
was
the
two
affidavits
by
two
of
the
accusing
witnesses
who
were
in
fact
air
force
military
policemen
upon
which
the
removal
was
sustained
and
it
was
these
witnesses
whom
counsel
for
the
petitioner
asked
the
air
force
to
produce
at
the
hearing.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes
sir,
at
the
outset
of
the
hearing
right
on
page
44,
the
last
sentence.
he
--
mr.
andrew
stated
that
in
other
words,
the
request
which
the
appellant
made
for
the
appearance
ryan,
stevens
and
tyler
was
rejected
to
which
mrs.
dillon
required
lineup
affirmative
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say
that
he
wants
them
for
cross-examination
and
he's
referring
back
to
that
same
request
on
47
and
again
on
48.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
from
the
record
that
he
requested
that
these
people
be
produced
for
cross,
not
for
direct
and
the
fact
that
they
had
their
case
in
by
affidavits
would
indicate
that
by
failing
to
make
an
objection
to
the
use
of
the
affidavits,
he
wanted
to
use
the
affidavits
for
the
purpose
of
cross.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes
sir,
it
was
at
the
hearing
itself.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes
sir,
after
the
affidavits
were
read.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no
sir.
the
record
does
not
indicate
that
he
did
so.
we
take
the
position
however
that
the
air
force
regulation
110-5
required
to
him
to
ask
the
air
force
to
produce
them
because
they're
precluded
from
appearing
voluntarily
if
he
would've
asked
them.
110
makes
it
--
110-5
required
him
to
asked
the
air
force
to
produce
these
men
at
the
hearing.
he
couldn't
just
ask
them
to
appear
and
they
would
appear
because
air
force
regulation
110-5
prohibits
just
that
kind
of
procedure.
now,
that
that
regulation
is
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief
and
i
think
it's
quite
clear
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes
sir,
he
was.
we
take
the
point
--
we
take
the
position,
number
one,
that
the
reason
he
didn't
come
in
and
personally
appear
when
he
first
got
the
notification
of
charges
because
he
couldn't
come
on
the
base.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
appears
from
18
to
19
of
the
record
if
he
did
show
up
on
the
base,
there
was
an
order
out
for
his
arrest
so
he
answered
the
charge
in
writing.
i
think
that
this
arrest
order
would
seriously
have
inhibited
him
from
talking
to
the
air
force
military
policeman
on
the
base
who
in
fact
ordered
to
arrest
them
and
who
in
fact
where
the
witnesses
who
were
--
the
air
force
witnesses
at
--
who
had
supplied
the
affidavits
which
were
used
in
the
civil
service
commission
hearing
in
kansas
and
upon
which
–-
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
hope
so.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
what
the
record
stated
(voice
overlap)
your
honor,
that's
the
way
you
are
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
think
it's
quite
clear
and
i
would
also
like
to
point
to
page
85
at
the
record
where
they
explain
their
failure
to
produce
them
to
the
civil
service
commission
and
it
said
here
this
witnesses
at
furnish
warrant
statements
concerning
mr.
william's
behavior
and
it
was
considered
unnecessary
to
bring
them
to
the
hearing,
whether
it
was
felt
that
any
testimony
they
would
give
would
be
repetitious
and
it
would've
made
william's
case
even
worse.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no
sir
but
they
point
out
there
that
the
air
force
academy
and
here
is
the
important
part,
knowing
the
character
and
reputation
of
the
airmen
who
were
concerned
in
this
matter,
it
is
firmly
believe
that
even
had
the
officials
of
the
academy
deem
it
necessary
for
them
to
attend
neither
the
counsel
for
williams
nor
mr.
williams
could
have
discredited
them
upon
cross-examination.
so,
obviously
the
air
force
knew
that
the
reason
that
they
were
being
asked
to
produce
these
people
was
for
the
purpose
to
cross-examine.
i
think
when
these
portions
of
the
record
are
read
together,
there
can't
be
really
any
question
about
the
fact
that
a
request
was
made
and
under
refusal
was
also
made
and
made
explicit.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
we
certainly
take
the
position
referring
to
page
85
which
has
been
cited
that
there
was
no
desire
or
intent
on
the
part
of
any
official
of
the
air
force
academy
to
preclude
the
witnesses
from
appearing.
we
are
--
we
do
not
believe
had
a
request
be
directed
--
directed
to
the
witnesses
or
the
staff
judge
advocate
that
the
air
force
would
have
declined
to
permit
to
go
[inaudible]
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
for
cross-examination,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
believe
(voice
overlap)
--
under
the
air
force
regulation
the
air
force
would
have
been
obliged
to
permit
them
to
come
and
to
carry
out
the
policy.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
the
civil
service
commission
examiner?
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
that
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
believe
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
believe
that
if
he
had
said
at
the
hearing
that
we
have
attempted
to
make
arrangements
to
have
these
witnesses
attend
and
we
have
been
unsuccessful
with
the
air
force
at
the
commissioner
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that
is
what
the
record
show
and
you
are
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
don't
think
we're
at
[inaudible]
on
that
(voice
overlap)
there
was
no
request
to
the
witnesses.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
right.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
our
position
is
that
we
--
i
would
not
--
i
would
like
you
to
--
court
understand
that
had
he
made
a
request
first
to
the
air
force
staff
judge
advocate
and
said,
“we
want
you
to
assist
us
in
getting
these
witnesses.”
that
the
too
raised
the
question
but
he
did
not
do
that.
he
did
not
approach
the
witnesses,
he
did
not
approach
staff
judge
advocate
which
the
air
force
regulations
provide
its
air
force
regulations
provide
its
air
force
policy
for
him
to
permit
witnesses
to
testify.
the
orderly
procedure
would
have
been
to
approach
the
witnesses
and
ask
them
to
attend.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
think
he
came
to
the
hearing
and
stated,
“the
witnesses
aren't
here,
i
expect
you
to
produce
the
witnesses.”
he
said
that
to
the
air
force
personnel
officer
who
was
there
and
the
air
force
personnel
officer's
stated,
“we
didn't
think
it
was
necessary
to
produce
them
as
part
of
our
case.”
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
that
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
i
certainly
said
that
we
think
it
would
be
very
questionable
whether
the
government
would
be
here.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
we
--
the
air
force
policy
would
have
been
to
have
the
witnesses
at
the
airway,
had
he
made
a
request.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
they
are
members
of
the
airway,
that's
right.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
it
could
have
done,
yes.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
my
argument
really
is
i
think
as
i
hope
i
stated
that
had
he
ask
to
witnesses
to
come,
have
they
not
come,
had
he
told
the
air
force
they
weren't
coming,
the
air
force
would've
seen
that
they
had
come,
that
they
would
have
come.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
there
was
a
third
person
that
he
didn't
ask
to
come,
there
were
three
witnesses.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
and
he
asked
for
two
of
them
to
come,
the
third
just
--
he
didn't
make
a
request
that
the
third
would
be
here.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
the
third
one
was
at
the
oklahoma
base
which
was
somewhat
more
distant.
he
have
been
subsequently
transferred.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
this
hearing
was
in
denver,
regional
10
hearing.
may
i
say
further
in
answer
of
the
question
whether
they
would
have
been
ordered
to
come,
should
i
take
it
that
on
the
basis
of
grievance
proceeding
hearing
where
the
air
force
would
have
ordered
the
witnesses
to
appear
and
he
availed
himself
of
that
procedure
that
it
would
have
take
him
the
same
steps
in
the
order
into
appear
at
a
civil
service
hearing
had
he
sought
that.
there's
no
question
on
the
regulation
been
to
order
to
witnesses
to
appear
at
the
grievance
hearing
which
is
an
air
force
procedure.
therefore,
i
can
make
no
distinction
then,
i
see
no
reason
why
it
should
have
not
order
them
to
come,
had
he
asked
for
them
to
come
at
a
civil
service
hearing.
thank
you.
