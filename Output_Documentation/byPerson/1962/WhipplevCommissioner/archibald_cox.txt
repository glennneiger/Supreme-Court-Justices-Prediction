mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
recall
your
attention
in
the
beginning
to
the
precise
words
of
the
statute
section
23
(k)
of
the
revenue
act
of
1939
which
was
inserted
in
1942.
that
provides
that
a
loss
on
a
bad
debt
would
be
fully
deductible
from
ordinary
income
if
and
only
if
it
is
a
debt
--
the
loss
from
which
is
incurred
in
the
taxpayer's
trade
or
business.
to
provide
--
to
obtain
the
full
deduction
therefore,
the
taxpayer
must
show
not
only
first,
that
he
was
engaged
at
some
point
in
a
trade
or
business,
but
also
second,
that
the
loss
was
incurred
in
that
trade
or
business.
now,
the
first
requirement
of
a
trade
or
business
plainly
cannot
be
satisfied
merely
by
showing
that
the
taxpayer
entered
into
the
transaction
with
the
hope
of
reaping
a
profit.
now,
the
tax
laws
have
consistently
distinguished
between
trade
or
business,
a
comparatively
narrowed
term
and
transactions
entered
into
for
profit
or
income
producing
transaction.
a
looser
term
which
may
or
may
not
include
a
narrower
one
but
which
in
any
event
is
frequently
used
in
our
position.
it's
also
settled
that
investing
ones
money
and
receiving
a
return
in
the
form
of
income
or
capital
gain
is
not
a
trade
or
business,
no
matter
how
much
time,
effort
or
attention
it
consumed.
the
second
requirement
that
the
loss
be
incurred
in
the
trade
or
business
is
the
rock
upon
which
much
of
my
brother's
argument
is
founded.
mr.
dillingham
seeks
to
bundle
up
together
all
these
taxpayer's
miscellaneous
activities
including
the
debt
of
the
resulting
loss
and
then
to
ask
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
is
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business,
but
this
is
only
half
of
necessary
inquiry.
section
23
(k)
doesn't
say
that
anyone
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business
may
deduct
any
bad
debt.
it
says
that
the
loss
must
be
incurred
in
the
trade
or
business,
and
obviously
the
same
man
may
be
both
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business
as
to
part
of
his
activity.
and
he
may
be
investor
as
another
part
or
as
by
may
using
for
an
example
mr.
dillingham
might
do
if
he
were
to
invest
money
in
the
alaska
wildcat
mining
corporation.
that
would
not
be
a
loss
if
it
were
unfortunate
that
was
incurred
in
but
for
tax
purposes
is
the
trade
or
business
of
practicing
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
that
money
lending,
if
i
may
large
enough
scale
and
repetitive
enough
and
to
enough
people
involve
really
dealing
in
money
and
became
a
trade
or
business.
but
the
courts,
the
courts
below
had
found
against
the
taxpayer
on
that
point.
if
i
remember
correctly
in
his
reply
brief,
he
disclaims
being
in
business
as
a
money
lender.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
was
thinking,
mr.
justice,
that
one
of
my
difficulties
in
answering
was
that
i
don't
know
what
went
on
behind
that
door
and
probably
you
do.
but
to
put
it
a
little
--
mr.
archibald
cox
to
put
it
little
differently,
the
term
capitalist
may
describe
activities
some
of
which
constitute
engagement
in
a
trade
or
business
or
it
may
not.
and
i
think
this
is
indeed
the
part
to
which
i
was
leading
up
was
i
think
that
really
here
there
is
no
alternative
to
analyzing
the
petitioner's
activity
with
those
two
critical
questions
in
mind.
was
some
relevant
part
of
them
trade
or
business?
if
the
answer
is
yes,
then
was
the
loss
incurred
in
or
as
part
of
the
activities
that
constitute
trade
or
business?
not
as
part
of
his
total
and
wider
activity.
so
with
that
in
mind
i
propose
first
to
look
at
the
taxpayer's
relations
with
mission
orange,
his
activities
there
would
have
view
to
showing
that
none
of
them
constituted
a
trade
or
business.
and
second
that
if
any
part
of
them
did
constitute
a
trade
or
business,
the
loss
was
not
incurred
in
that
part.
after
that,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
his
other
activities
and
go
on
to
show
that
they
do
not
affect
the
case
and
in
dealing
with
that
part
of
the
case,
i
shall
emphasize
that
whether
or
not
some
of
them
were
trade
or
business
such
as
his
partnerships
which
probably
were,
the
loss
was
not
incurred
in
connection
there
with.
now,
as
to
the
fact,
the
petitioner
first
became
interested
in
mission
orange
early
in
1951.
for
about
three
months,
he
operated
the
enterprise
as
a
sole
proprietor
under
that
state
of
course
of
bottling
and
distributing
soft
drinks
was
his
trade
or
business.
then
in
july
1951,
in
order
to
avoid
the
personal
liability
that
would
be
attendant
upon
carrying
on
that
trade
or
business
of
distributing
goods
to
the
public,
he
transferred
--
he
formed
the
mission
orange
corporation
and
transferred
the
assets
to
the
corporation.
and
the
bottling
and
distributing
of
soft
drink
then
became
the
corporation's
trade
or
business.
and
his
activities
in
connection
with
bottling
and
distributing
soft
drinks,
producing
soft
drinks
became
activities
in
the
corporation's
business
and
the
promotion
thereof.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
got
no
salary
from
this
corporation.
he
made
no
claim
until
his
reply
brief
in
this
court
that
he
had
any
arrangement
calling
for
payment
or
that
he
intended
to
get
a
payment
or
that
he
was
hoping
in
the
future
to
get
a
payment
that
has
been
interjected
for
the
first
time
in
the
reply
brief
and
i
shall
deal
with
it
little
later
on.
originally,
he
put
$25,000
into
the
company
by
transferring
the
assets
to
it
on
credit
and
he
had
also
put
in
something
over
$8,000
in
the
form
of
stock.
then
his
stock
holdings
were
increased
to
something
between
$30,000
and
$31,000
and
he
begged
during
1952
and
1953
cash
advances
totaling
about
$55,000.
so
that
by
december
1,
1953,
he
had
in
advance
just
less
than
$80,000
to
the
corporation,
quite
apart
from
his
stock
investment.
in
december
1953,
when
the
company
was
apparently
already
hopelessly
insolvent,
he
put
up
another
$55,000,
i
think
it
was,
to
pay
off
trade
creditors
and
the
assets
were
all
transferred
to
him.
and
without
stopping
to
discuss
the
detail,
you'll
note
that
both
courts
below
indicated
that
this
was
a
separate
special
transaction
which
might
not
qualify
regardless
of
the
main
one.
during
the
period,
he
was
the
dominant
shareholder
and
president
of
the
corporation.
he
made
important
policy
decisions,
prescribed
to
business
practices
and
during
part
of
the
time
he
performed
the
functions
of
plant
manager.
he
received
no
salary,
as
i
said
earlier,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question.
now,
this
branch
of
case
--
and
it
is
necessary
to
make
some
division
here,
raises
the
question
which
we
take
it
that
certiorari
was
granted
to
resolve,
whether
a
man
who
organizes
one
or
more
corporations,
puts
money
into
them
as
a
shareholder
and
as
a
large
lender
manages
their
business
but
does
all
this
with
the
expectation
of
profiting
as
a
lender
and
shareholder
may
nevertheless,
when
one
of
the
corporations
failed,
deduct
his
losses
on
the
debts
on
the
ground
that
he
was
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business
and
that
the
loss
was
incurred
in
that
trade
or
business.
the
petitioner,
as
you
have
heard,
would
answer
both
questions
yes
on
the
ground
that
there's
some
difference
between
an
active
and
a
passive
investor.
and
he
is
sustained
in
that
by
decisions
in
the
first,
eighth
circuits
and
in
the
court
of
claims.
we
answered
no
to
either
or
both
questions
depending
on
the
assumptions,
and
i
think
we
are
squarely
sustained
by
the
decisions
in
the
second,
fifth,
and
ninth
circuit.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
two
just
before
we
recess.
that
we
think
it
is
quite
wrong
to
speak
as
if
the
current
of
authorities
was
continuous
up
until
the
revenue
act
of
1954.
commissioner
against
smith,
a
second
circuit
decision
which
sustained
this
and
which
we
think
is
not
in
any
way
been
overruled
or
qualified
was
decided
in
1953.
and
two
cases
in
this
court,
dalton
and
bowers,
and
burnett
and
clark
go
all
the
way
back
to
1932.
and
we
think
they
sustained
us
in
principle.
i'll
address
myself
to
that
general
question
first
tomorrow
morning,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
pointed
out
that
in
order
to
qualify
for
a
business
bad
debt
deduction
under
section
23
(k),
it
was
necessary
for
the
taxpayer
to
show
not
only
that
some
part
of
his
activities
constituted
trade
or
business,
but
also
second
and
equally
important
that
the
loss
on
the
debt
was
incurred
in
the
trader
business,
that
is
to
say
in
that
part
of
his
activities
which
constituted
trade
or
business.
we
had
then
gone
over
at
these
taxpayers'
relationship
to
mission
orange
corporation
with
a
view
of
applying
those
tests
to
it.
his
activities
had
been
described
and
i
think
it
can
be
fairly
summarized
to
say
that
he
organized
the
corporation,
that
he
put
up
the
financing
some
$80,000,
partly
less
than
half
but
partly
in
the
form
of
stock
so
that
he
became
the
80%
dominating
stockholder,
and
the
rest
in
the
form
of
loans.
and
then
he
continued
to
give
an
indeterminate
amount
of
time
to
the
affairs
of
the
mission
orange
corporation
managing
and
carrying
on
its
business.
and
the
question
as
this
case
originally
came
before
the
court
was
whether
those
activities
including
the
debt
could
be
bundled
together
so
as
to
say
that
there
was
a
trade
or
business
and
that
the
loss
was
incurred
in
the
trade
or
business.
in
other
words,
the
taxpayer
was
pressing
that
he
was
not
a
passive
investor,
who
we
conceded
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
business
bad
debt
deduction,
but
was
arguing
that
he
was
an
active
investor,
and
that
this
activity
entitled
him
to
the
full
business
bad
debt
deduction.
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
several
thoughts
in
that
argument.
the
first
is
that
it
overlooks
the
distinction
so
penetrating
in
our
law
between
a
corporation
and
its
shareholders.
after
all,
the
property
of
the
corporation
is
not
the
property
of
the
stockholders,
and
the
business
of
the
corporation
is
not
the
business
of
the
stockholders,
even
in
the
case
of
a
one-man
corporation.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
--
some
family
and
some
apparently
employees,
and
about
the
rest,
the
finding
showed
nothing.
it
was
scattered
over
six
or
seven
people.
when
the
petitioner
transferred
the
bottling
and
distributing
business
which
had
been
his
business
before
he
formed
the
corporation,
then
he
went
out
of
the
business
and
his
activities
that
they're
on
in
behalf
of
the
business
became
activities
in
the
corporation's
business
and
in
support
of
his
investment.
the
second
difficulty
it
seems
to
us
with
petitioner's
effort
to
distinguish
between
active
and
passive
investors
is
that
uncompensated
personal
activities
aimed
at
building
up
a
corporation's
business
so
as
to
increase
one's
dividends
or
increase
the
value
of
one
stockholdings
or
make
ones
debts
more
secure,
is
not
an
independent
trade
or
business.
those
activities,
we
think,
are
no
different
in
principle
from
the
activities
that
the
taxpayer
was
engaged
in
the
higgins
case,
activities
that
were
time
consuming,
but
were
directed
and
intending
to
and
increasing
the
value
of
investments
rather
than
a
trade
or
business.
for
carrying
on
a
trade
or
business
as
justice
frankfurter
said
in
deputy
against
du
pont,
involves
holding
oneself
out
to
others
as
engaged
in
selling
goods
or
services
without
some
sale
or
exchange
or
without
some
quid
pro
quo
or
consideration.
no
amount
of
promoting,
advising,
performing,
or
managing
corporation
can
constitute
a
trade
or
business.
and
this
doesn't
mean
that
advising
or
managing
a
company
or
promoting
companies
can
never
be
a
trade
or
business
or
where
one
receives
a
fee
either
in
dollars
or
in
some
other
form
in
the
form
of
an
allocation
of
stuff
or
in
the
form
of
property
perchance,
then
of
course,
the
element
of
sale
or
exchange
is
present
and
we
would
concede
that
the
trade
or
business
element
of
the
case
was
made
out.
but
in
this
case,
there
was
no
quid
pro
quo.
there
was
no
element
of
exchange.
he
received
no
salary,
there's
not
slightest
evidence
and
certainly
no
finding
that
he
ever
intended
to
receive
a
salary.
all
it
was
done
was
activities
intended
to
increase
his
profit
through
dividends
and
through
appreciation
of
the
value
of
the
shares
and
increasing
the
chance
that
he
would
get
the
repayment
of
his
debt.
but
all
of
those,
as
i
say,
were
directed
at
the
investments.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
i
said,
yes,
they
--
i
think
that
is
irrelevant
because
you
can't
bundle
it
all
together
and
these
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
seem
to
me
that
he
--
that,
i
would
agree
that
he
is
in
trade
or
business
in
the
corporations
for
which
he
works
and
receives
salary.
but
at
that
point,
he
fails
on
the
other
requirement
to
where
he
can't
show
that
this
loan
was
in
anyway
related
to
those
other
trade
or
business
activities.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
the
salary
point
with
respect
to
the
other
business
is
certainly
not
determinative,
and
i
would
say
that
the
salary
point
even
with
respect
to
mission
orange
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
subject
to
this
qualification.
it
would
be
substantially
the
same.
and
this
was
the
next
objection
to
this
area
that
i
would
like
to
express
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
the
element
of
trade
or
business
would
be
made
out,
to
with
that
he
and
then
to
the
extent
that
he
was
rendering
services
to
that
corporation
would
be
in
a
trade
or
business.
if
he
had
to
pay
a
secretary
for
example
in
order
to
be
an
officer
of
the
corporation,
then
he
could
deduct
this
incident
to
his
trade
or
business
to
that
expense.
but
that
would
remand
request
where
these
large
loans
in
anyway
related
to
his
trade
or
business
of
rendering
services
to
the
corporation,
and
i
would
be
arguing,
if
i
might
just
say
a
word
or
two
more
in
answering
the
question,
i
would
be
arguing
and
do
argue
here
that
there
is
no
relationship
between
the
loans
and
any
services
that
he
rendered
to
mission
orange.
indeed,
there
are
several
reasons
for
asserting
that
very
confidently.
the
first
place,
he
never
made
this
claim
before
the
tax
court
or
before
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
this
court
until
he
had
read
our
brief
and
shifted
his
ground
in
an
effort,
we
flatter
our
things
to
ourselves
in
thinking
to
avoid
enforcing
it.
in
the
second
place,
the
loans
were
so
great
in
size
compared
to
any
return
that
he
could
have
gotten
from
these
part
time
personal
services
that
it
seems
foolish
to
think
that
he
was
making
the
loans
to
the
company
so
that
he
could
protect
his
job.
now
the
reason
i
said
a
minute
ago,
justice
white
that
i
would
recognize
one
qualification,
there
are
cases,
the
leading
cases
commissioner
against
trent
in
the
second
circuit,
where
a
man
in
order
to
continue
to
hold
his
job
was
forced
to
lend
money
to
the
corporation,
and
indeed
when
he
stopped
lending
any
more
money,
he
was
fired.
so
there
was
very
good
evidence
that
he
have
to
put
up
some
money
to
hold
the
job.
in
that
sort
of
case,
we
would
agree,
certainly
we
don't
argue
the
contrary
here
that
the
necessary
relationship
existed.
but
here
there
wasn't
that
kind
of
relationship
and
it
was
never
suggested
there
was,
and
that
there
was
a
flat
finding
against
the
taxpayer
on
that
point.
on
page
32
in
the
opinion
of
the
tax
court,
it
is
said,
“we
cannot
find
that
the
purpose
of
these
loans
was
other
than
to
protect
that
investment
such
lending
activity
does
not
constitute
a
trade
or
business.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
would
have
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
--
i
think
i
would
suggest
they
were
separate
parts.
let
me
--
let
me
just
say
a
word
or
two
to
supply
a
transition
and
then
come
to
your
question.
let
us
now
look
in
terms
of
the
actual
facts
here
as
to
the
question
whether
the
number
of
corporations
which
the
taxpayer
was
interested
in
makes
any
difference
assuming
that
i'm
right
looking
at
mission
orange
loans.
but
i
would
say
if
it's
two
or
three
or
four
or
five,
and
that
he
has
formed
some
and
holds
the
stock
with
no
immediate
notion
of
selling
it,
that
then
it
is
simply
an
investment.
the
same
principle
applies
as
you
suggested
yesterday
whether
there's
one
or
two
or
three
or
four
or
five.
and
of
course,
this
is
just
what
the
second
circuit
said
in
the
smith
case.
now,
i
would
agree
that
if
there
are
enough
corporations,
then
in
legal
theory,
there
are
some
other
arguments
that
a
taxpayer
might
make.
one
might
buy
and
sell
corporations
as
he
did
choose
coal
mines
or
something
like
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
perhaps
so,
but
one
can
conceive
of
a
corporation
being
a
stock
in
trade.
mr.
archibald
cox
of
a
number
of
them.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it
would
to
qualify.
but
again,
the
findings
are
clear
here
by
both
courts
below
that
this
taxpayer
did
not
in
--
deal
in
corporation
and
that
he
falls
short
on
that
ground.
indeed,
there's
no
evidence
that
he
had
any
notion
ever
of
disposing
of
the
mission
orange
stock.
he
wasn't
a
dealer
in
the
corporation.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
be
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
of
course
i
think
that
is
the
common
sense
behind
what
we're
arguing
about,
that
although
i
can't
--
as
your
honor
will
immediately
realize,
press
this
to
a
logical
conclusion
because
there
are
too
many
exception.
still
i
think
the
central
core
of
the
business
bad
debt
deduction
is
that
you
--
when
the
debts
came
in,
they
would
come
in
to
gross
receipts
in
the
ordinary
income
and
therefore,
what
doesn't
come
in,
it's
fair
to
set
it
off
against
it.
but
now,
i
can't
press
this
too
far,
but
i
think
this
is
the
central
core
of
the
thing
and
that
therefore
any
claim
that
doesn't
satisfy
that,
it
has
to
be
looked
at
with
greater
care
and
it
might
otherwise
be
the
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
will
want
to
take
it
as
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
the
other
possibility
other
than
buying
and
selling
corporations,
just
to
touch
all
the
bases,
is
that
he's
a
manufacturer
and
seller
of
corporations.
so
one
can
conceive
that
by
stretching
his
imagination
a
good
deal
of
that
kind
of
activity,
but
of
course,
again
the
finding
is
against
him
that
he
wasn't
the
dealer
in
corporations.
mr.
archibald
cox
then,
wouldn't
the
income
from
the
mission
orange
business
be
taxable
to
the
petitioner
as
ordinary
income.
in
other
words,
the
partnership
like
a
sole
entrepreneur,
he
would
be
engaged
in
the
trade
or
business.
but
here
he
runs
into
the
objection
that
the
corporation's
business
is
not
his
business.
and
i
may
say
in
that
connection
that
the
leading
case
of
course,
distinguishing
between
the
corporation's
business
and
the
taxpayer's
business
is
burnet
and
clark
which
we
think
on
its
fact
is
an
all
force
with
this
case.
in
burnet
and
clark
the
taxpayer
was
the
majority
shareholder
in
a
dredging
company.
he
spent
his
time
working
for
the
dredging
company.
he
did
have
some
incidental
enterprises
which
were
in
a
related
field.
in
order
to
keep
the
dredging
company
alive,
he
endorsed
a
number
of
its
notes
and
under
putnam
we
can
think
of
those
just
as
if
they
were
debts.
later
the
corporation
failed
and
he
did
not
recover,
could
not
recover
the
full
amount
of
the
debt.
he
sought
to
deduct
it
on
the
ground
that
this
was
a
loss
--
a
loss
incurred
or
resulting
from
the
operation
of
a
trade
or
business.
the
second
circuit
said
it
was.
it
said,
“you
can't
breakdown
this
activity.”
this
court
reversed
and
held
that
the
monetary
losses
from
the
endorsements,
the
debt
losses
were
not
part
of
the
trade
or
business.
now,
the
court
didn't
consider
all
the
arguments
that
are
presented
here
by
mr.
dillingham
but
the
holding
is
perfectly
clear.
the
only
factual
difference
it
seems
to
me
today
that
clark
did
not
form
the
company.
but
a
companion
case,
dalton
against
bowers,
was
the
one
involving
six
corporations.
and
there
the
taxpayer
had
formed
them,
but
the
court
indicated
that
that
made
no
difference
whatsoever.
there
are
a
number
of
other
miscellaneous
arguments
that
are
made.
i
want
to
deal
with
just
two
of
them
and
each
in
a
sentence.
the
taxpayer
argues
while
i
was
in
the
bottling
and
distributing
business,
i
had
this
other
root
beer
company
and
i
had
a
franchise
to
sell
dispensing
machines,
and
i
want
to
take
the
whole
thing
together
and
say
i
was
in
the
bottling
business.
well
of
course,
there
he
runs
into
the
problem
that
i
was
just
addressing
myself
to,
that
the
company
so
far
as
the
mission
orange
part
was
concerned
with
what
was
in
the
business,
and
he
cannot
claim
that
he
was.
another
argument
that
i
should
mention
very
gratefully
and
i'm
sorry
this
has
to
be
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
he
could
say
it,
it's
for
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
could
say
it
in
an
ordinary
conversation
but
he
wouldn't
be
in
the
business
of
manufacturing
and
selling
automobiles
for
the
purposes
of
the
tax
law
because
that's
general
motor's
business.
i
mean,
business
is
often
used
and
this
court
in
other
context
has
used
it
in
a
broader
sense,
i
couldn't
deny
that.but
the
case,
you
say,
that
the
flint,
stone
and
tracy
used
a
new
business
and
i
mean,
these
clarifications
are
not
applicable
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
one
other
aspect
of
the
case
that
i
should
mention.
the
argument
is
made,
it
was
made
orally
and
it
is
made
from
the
reply
brief,
while
i
was
in
the
business
of
leasing
real
estates,
and
these
loans
were
made
to
protect
my
interest
in
the
rents
from
the
real
estate
that
i
lease
to
mission
orange.
well,
i
would
agree
again
that
as
a
matter
of
legal
theory
one
can
conceive
a
case
in
which
a
loan
might
be
made
to
protect
one's
interest
in
rentals.
i
supposed
the
easiest
example
would
be
--
we
owned
a
lot
and
department
store
and
then
leased
it
to
the
company
that
was
operating
the
department
store
and
it
needed
cash
to
get
over
a
difficult
time.
if
it
was
a
profitable
lease,
you
might
put
up
the
money
in
order
to
protect
your
interest
in
the
lease.but
here,
the
facts
just
don't
bear
this
out.
in
the
first
place,
the
argument
was
never
made
in
the
tax
court.
in
the
second
place,
most
of
the
loans
were
made
before
the
building
--
that
was
the
--
the
building
was
leased
to
mission
orange
and
the
testimony
was
that
the
building
was
built
and
the
land
was
used
for
the
purpose
in
order
to
try
and
save
mission
orange,
in
other
words,
to
try
to
save
the
investment
rather
the
other
--
than
the
other
way
around,
and
then
finally
we
come
to
the
point
that
i
emphasized
before
that
there
is
a
critical
finding
of
fact
on
this
point
against
the
petitioner
to
with
that
the
loan
was
made
only
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
investment
and
that
finding
is
certainly
supported
by
a
substantial
evidence.
and
we
think
it's
conclusive
on
all
of
these
minor
aspects
of
the
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
i
would
put
--
i
was
thinking
about
that
overnight.
i
would
put
the
point
this
way
justice
goldberg.
the
question
whether
a
loss
is
incurred
in
a
trade
or
business
is
very
much
a
question
of
fact.
the
only
question
raised
here
which
is
not
on
the
fact
is
whether
as
a
matter
of
law
being
what
mr.
dillingham
calls
an
active
investing
that
it
say
being
active
in
the
affairs
of
the
company
to
which
you
loan
the
money
is
as
a
matter
of
law
enough
to
get
the
deduction.
we
say
that
it
is
not.
he
has
some
earlier
cases,
let's
say
that
it
is,
we
say
that
those
things
can't
be
bundled
up
together
as
a
matter
of
law
that
if
the
--
factually
the
thrust
is
to
gain
through
investment,
then
the
higgins
case
is
controlling.
then
we
say
once
you
accept
higgins
and
apply
it
to
the
person
who
is
active
in
promoting
his
investment,
all
the
remaining
questions
are
questions
of
fact
and
that
here
we
have
the
concurrent
findings
of
two
bodies
below
in
our
favor
on
all
those
questions
of
fact.
