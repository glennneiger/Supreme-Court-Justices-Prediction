how
about
dividends?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
sale
of
the
stocks?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
dividends
--
of
these
dividends
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
claim
that?
justice

(inaudible)
justice

mr.
dillingham,
is
it
--
would
your
argument
be
exactly
the
same
if
he
was
in
only
one
company
and
it
was
a
large
company
and
he'd
spent
all
of
his
time
managing
that
company,
and
he
got
salary,
and
he
got
interest,
he
loaned
that
money
and
he
spend
all
this
time
at
it,
he
was
an
officer
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
in
time,
the
opinion
of
the
things
you're
talking
would
be
just
as
meaningful
in
the
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
of
that
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
it
--
what
does
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
fact
that
he
was
loaning
money
to
the
company
or
giving
it
managerial
advice,
it
isn't
what
distinguishes
his
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
fact
that
he
is
doing
it
to
a
lot
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
these
translates
--
the
complexity
translates
the
nonbusiness
to
a
business
person?

justice
byron

white
was
it
irrelevant
that
he
got
salaries
from
other
corporations
which
were
part
of
what
he
said
was
his
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
part
of
his
claim,
i
suppose,
is
that
he
--
he
did
a
trade
or
business
because
it
is
in
other
corporations.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
really
--
the
salary
point
the
--
is
not
determinant
in
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
had
his
salary
for
mission
orange,
you
would
still
be
making
the
same
argument,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then,
there
wouldn't
be
a
quid
pro
quo
or
would
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it's
--
i
suppose
it's
possible
to
conceive
a
trade
or
business
in
which
you
do
organize
and
help
managed
corporations
with
the
idea
of
the
--
your
stock
increasing
in
value
when
selling
the
stocks.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event
you
would
be
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
part
of
the
business
might
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
making
loans,
part
of
the
business
might
be
working
for
a
salary.
