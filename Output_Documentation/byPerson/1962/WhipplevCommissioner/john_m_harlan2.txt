how
would
you
define
the
business
activity
that
you
claim?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
trouble
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
trouble
that
is
that
the
statute
requires
that
he'd
be
given
a
label
or
the
statute
has
given
it
a
label.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
these
have
been
going
enterprises
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with,
i
mean
independently
himself
and
he'd
made
some
loans
from
time
to
time,
do
one
or
more
going
corporations
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
without
a
small
stock
interest
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
would
that
--
would
those
be
deductible?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i
said
if
he
had
not
organized
them.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
turned
my
question
around,
i
am
saying,
supposing
he
had
none
of
those
relationships
with
the
corporation
but
simply
he'd
made
a
loan.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
my
--
my
only
point
is
that
you
cannot
escape
the
necessity
of
showing
that
these
were
business
bad
debts,
that
means
showing
that
they
were
incurred
in
connection
with
some
kind
of
business
which
it
kept
taxpayers
engaged,
would
you
agree
with
that
much?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you've
got
findings
of
facts
against
you,
is
it
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
was
the
other
20%
of
the
stock?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
the
situation
that
he
was
--
that
this
is
a
partnership
instead
of
a
corporation?
