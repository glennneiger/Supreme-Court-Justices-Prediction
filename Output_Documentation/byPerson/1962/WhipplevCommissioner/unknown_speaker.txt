wrong
one.
unknown
speaker
that
this
bottling
corporation
was
just
like
--
it
was
formed
in
the
same
way
as
all
of
the
others.
now,
the
fact
that
it
unfortunately
wasn't
that
they
were
successful
because
that's
the
history
of
bad
debt
cases,
and
i
don't
think
that
your
business
disappears
because
--
a
retail
merchant's
business
doesn't
disappear
because
one
of
his
customers
doesn't
pay
him
or
even
that
he
picked
the
wrong
line
of
hats
that
won't
sell.
this
bottling
corporation
is
made
for
the
same
purposes
and
in
the
same
line
of
activities
as
all
these
other
corporations
are
formed.
he
went
into
all
sorts
of
enterprise.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
somebody
doesn't
pay
you
a
debt
that
that
becomes
a
loss
because
their
customer's
business
goes
bad.
you'd
always
have
the
risk
of
--
when
you
make
a
loan,
you
always
have
the
risk
of
the
debtor
not
succeeding.
and
he
--
this
was
--
as
far
as
the
record
shows
and
as
far
as
on
my
personal
knowledge
is,
this
was
the
only,
only
instance
and
this
is
with
which
he
suffered
the
loss.
i
don't
think
that
it's
reasonable
to
have
a
man
who's
paid
ordinary
income
all
--
over
all
these
years
and
have
a
successful
business
and
the
first
time
he
suffers
the
lost
to
say
well,
that's
different.
that
should
now
be
a
capital
investment
or
something.
that's
what
the
--
this
was
just
like
the
others
as
far
as
his
purposes
and
the
way
he
operate
in
connection
with
it.
actually,
this,
in
this
corporation,
he
furnished
one
thing.
he
didn't
some
of
the
others.
and
that
was
--
he
actually
furnished
some
of
them
personally
held
and
allowed
them
operate
under
a
franchise,
was
still
in
his
personal
name
and
that
he
was
personally
responsible
for.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
thank
you.
