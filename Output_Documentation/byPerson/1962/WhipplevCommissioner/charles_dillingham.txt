mr.
charles
dillingham
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
proceeding
originated
where
an
income
tax
deficiency
for
the
years
1952
and
1953,
the
issues
by
the
time
they
reached
the
tax
court,
had
narrowed
to
three.
first,
involving
a
deduction
for
a
payment
made
by
the
petitioner
to
one
dm
dossier
which
was
decided
favorably
for
the
taxpayer,
the
government
has
not
appealed
that.
the
second
involved
some
statutory
penalties
in
which
partially
decided
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
and
partially
for
the
government.
neither
side
has
appealed
that.
the
issue
before
this
court
coming
by
certiorari
from
the
fifth
circuit
has
split
decision.
judge
hutcheson
dissenting
and
the
sole
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
$56,975.10
bad
debt
owed
by
mission
orange
bottling
company
inc.
to
petitioner
was
a
business
bad
debt
or
a
non-business
bad
debt
within
section
23
(k)
(1)
and
23
(k)
(4)
of
the
internal
revenue
act
of
1939.
it
was
stipulated
in
the
tax
court
by
the
commissioner,
one,
that
this
was
a
debt;
and
two,
that
it
became
worthless
in
1953,
the
tax
here
in
question.
the
only
and
the
real
issue
in
this
case
as
responded
admits
in
his
brief
is
whether
the
extensive,
varied,
regular
and
continuous
activities
of
the
petitioner
over
a
long
period
of
years
were
business
activities
or
were
investment
activity.
some
idea
of
how
extensive
these
activities
were
or
how
varied
they
were
can
be
gathered
from
a
quick
glance
at
the
many
items
on
his
1952
income
tax
on
page
20
of
the
record.
how
extensive
they
were
can
be
determined
from
how
many
--
from
the
substantial
sums
amounting
to
over
$150,000
in
ordinary
income
which
these
activities
generated
in
the
years
1952
out
of
which
the
bad
debt
in
question
arose
in
the
form
of
$62,800
in
salaries
from
six
corporations
in
the
form
of
$27,500
in
rent
from
three
separate
building,
in
the
form
of
over
$4,000
in
interest
from
17
different
parties
and
$56,000
from
partnership
income.
these
came
from
enterprises
of
which
the
petitioner
was
the
architect.
he
created
these
himself.
these
came
from
business
not
investment
activity.
1941
to
1953,
the
petitioner
organized
some
22
corporations,
10
partnerships
and
a
number
of
joint
ventures.
some
idea
of
the
way
the
petitioner
operated
can
be
seen
from
the
account
of
high
form
and
promoted
the
tile
distributorship
with
a
man
named
lisby
on
page
88
and
89
of
the
record.
he
also
entered
into
the
restaurant
business.
he
promoted
oil
deals
in
west
texas
and
in
lee
--
in
lee
county
and
washington
county.
he
went
out
and
suddenly
bought
some
property
from
fairway
department
stores
when
they
were
under
the
gun
to
out
of
five-day
deadline
to
begin
construction
for
which
he
was
paid
a
fee
and
paid
ordinary
income
on.
mr.
charles
dillingham
mr.
justice
harlan,
it's
very
difficult
to
define
a
petitioner's
business
activities
and
i
think
that
was
the
--
one
of
the
troubles
of
the
decision
of
the
tax
court.
they
were
trying
to
fit
it
into
a
particular
category
to
try
to
give
it
a
label,
a
label
and
i
think
it's
always
dangerous
instead
of
analyzing
the
things
to
give
the
label.
mr.
charles
dillingham
he
was,
he
was
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
well,
i
don't
--
it
says
a
business
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
--
petitioner's
business.
i
would
say
that
if
you
have
to
state
what
his
business
was
and
this
is
not
the
kind
of
label
that's
ordinarily
given,
it
was
in
--
he
was
in
the
business
of
promoting,
organizing,
financing,
and
leasing
to
corporations,
partnerships,
and
joint
vec
--
ventures
and
conduct
--
and
conducting
business
activities
from
which
he
had
--
he
intended
and
had
reasonable
expectation.
and
in
fact
did
generate
substantial
sums
of
ordinary
income
separate
and
apart
from
the
operations
and
the
income
and
the
corporations
themselves.
mr.
charles
dillingham
well,
i
think
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
--
that
he
did
that
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
alright,
i
would
think
if
he
made
--
if
he
organized
the
corporation
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
i
think
if
he
made
loans
to
them,
if
he
managed
them,
if
he
rented
to
them,
if
he
collected
interest
from
them,
then
that
could
be
a
business
managing
the
corporation
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
well,
if
he
had
simply
made
a
loan
to
the
corporations,
he
might
have
made
a
number
of
loans
as
he
might
qualify
for
being
in
the
lending
business.
we're
not
resting
our
case
on
that.
mr.
charles
dillingham
i
would
agree
with
some
kind
of
business
but
i
think
that
the
answer
to
business
consists
of
two
things.
one
is
continued
regular
activities,
the
other
is
the
creation
of
ordinary
income.
both
of
these
he
did
for
over
a
long
period
of
years.
mr.
charles
dillingham
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
the
findings
of
fact
are
against
us.
i
believe
that
the
tax
court
held
that
which
---
that
he
was
not
in
a
--
in
a
business
because
the
business
of
organizing
and
promoting
and
lending
to
corporations.
and
ignored
the
fact
that
he'd
been
leasing
to
them
because
he
didn't
form
the
corporations
for
sale
and
that
is
the
crux
of
this
case.
that
is
a
rule
which
i
believe
is
so
narrow
rule
that
it
--
it
has
simplicity,
but
the
--
the
only
trouble
with
it
doesn't
apply
to
anybody
as
the
respondent
pretty
well
admits
in
his
brief.
and
it's
against
the
weight
of
authority
and
certainly
not
within
the
intent
of
congress.
he
formed
these
corporations
in
many
--
with
many
different
people
that
made
different
purposes
in
many
different
localities,
and
not
only
did
he
invest
his
money
and
induce
others
to
invest
his
money
in
a
stock
in
these
corporations,
but
over
a
period
of
10
years,
he
carried
on
a
regular
activity
of
advancing
temporary
financing
to
these
various
corporations
and
partnerships
with
the
idea
that
they
would
pay
it
for
their
special
demands
that
they
have
at
the
particular
time,
they
argued
they
would
pay
it
back
and
it
would
be
reloaned
to
others.
mr.
charles
dillingham
he
is
--
he
is
engaged
since
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
he
claimed
to
make
a
profit
and
his
purposes
was
--
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
that's
what
he
did.
he
created
a
series
of
enterprises
that
paid
him
a
salary
that
he
created
tenants
that
paid
him
rent.
he
--
in
the
course
of
these
loans,
he
collected
interests,
and
those
are
all
items
of
income
which
are
separate
and
apart
from
the
income
of
the
corporations
themselves.
mr.
charles
dillingham
dividends
come
from
ownership
and
investment
in
the
corporation.
his
dividends
are
negligible,
mr.
justice
white.
they
were
about
$3,400
compared
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
--
strictly
on
the
corporation
of
$94,000.
mr.
charles
dillingham
the
sale
of
the
stock,
that
is
--
i
think
in
one
of
the
things
that,
that
worried
the
tax
court
was
that
sale
of
the
--
of
the
stock
--
you're
talking
about
the
sale
of
stock
in
1951?
mr.
charles
dillingham
no,
sir.
he
never
claimed
to
be
in
the
business
of
forming
a
corporation
to
sale,
if
he
--
we've
had,
we
wouldn't
have
been
here.
the
tax
court
would
have
given
him
relief.
mr.
charles
dillingham
no,
he
never
did.
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
the
tax
court
after
we
had
rested
our
case,
the
tax
court
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
introduce
testimony
or
evidence
that
he
might
overlooked
as
to
--
as
to
having
form
the
corporations
for
sale.
mr.
charles
dillingham
well,
yes.
he
would
have
had
ordinary
income,
had
he
done
that
but
he's
been
pers
--
perfectly
consistent
throughout
in
saying
that
he
did
not
--
a
lot
would
have
qualified
in
his
case,
he
didn't
intend
it,
but
he
formed
these
corporations
to
make
--
to
carry
--
to
furnish
him
of
the
livelihood
to
the
say
--
to
furnish
him
of
the
salaries
and
rent
and
income,
he
lived
on
this.
he
was
not
a
--
this
is
not
the
type
of
person,
he's
not
a
promoter.
this
is
a
small
businessman
who
is
creating
different
enterprises.
and
i
am
--
and
take
--
going
into
different
ones
with
different
people,
so
that
there
will
be
more
of
these
entities
to
pay
him
salaries.
more
entities
to
pay
him
rent.
more
entities
to
pay
him
interest.
this
is
the
way
he
made
his
living.
this
is
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
no,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
wouldn't.
i
would
say
that
he
was,
he
was
in
one
sense
a
promoter
but
as
the
--
as
the
tax
court
restricted
the
term
“promoter”
to
the
type
of
person
who
forms
not
a
corporation
for
sale.
he
should
try
to
unload
it
on
somebody
to
profit
or
maybe
hold
it
for
a
while
in
a
crèche.
mr.
charles
dillingham
now
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
yes.
mr.
charles
dillingham
no.
mr.
charles
dillingham
well,
i
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
--
perhaps
object
to
the
term
capitalist
because
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
yes.
mr.
charles
dillingham
well
he
was,
he
was
well
except
--
he
was
more
--
he
--
there
was
--
it
was
true
as
one
of
the
witnesses
had
testified.
he
was
this
sort
of
person
because
of
his
abilities
in
raising
money
and
then
putting
things
together.
he
was
a
sort
a
person
that
people
brought
enterprises
to
but
he
didn't
wait
for
him
to
bring
them
to
him.
he
went
out
and
created
these
enterprises.
he
found
different
people.
as
you
see
all
through
the
record
a
number
of
different
people
that
he
would
organize
this
one
with
and
that
one
of
different
enterprise.
and
his
business
was
the
overall
management
coordination
of
these
activities
and
through
--
these
enterprises
paid
him
salaries
for
doing
that
and
paid
him
these
other
num
--
these
other
elements
of
ordinary
income
and
i
want
to
point
out
right
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
say
that
my
argument
might
be
the
same
if
i
were
up
here
before
this
court,
but
i
think
that
the
situation
is
entirely
different
and
it's
best
to
--
to
post
hypothetical,
i
would
say
that
hypothe
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
no,
i
don't
believe
so
because
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
because
if
you
form
one
corporation,
you
--
and
with
a
certain
set
of
stockholders,
that
is
a
relatively
simple
operation.
but
this
man's
business
was,
is
creating
with
a
set
of
different
stockholders
who
--
and
corporations
with
different
purposes
in
different
localities
who
--
you
don't
find
some
of
these
stockholders,
mr.
finley
in
his
bottling
plant
was
not
interested
in
building
houses
or
the
lumber
business,
and
you
don't
have
some
of
these
others
not
interested
in
oil
deal,
and
certainly
mr.
head
wasn't
interested
in
investing
in
a
corporation
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
it
--
it
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
i
think
that
that
--
you
asked
me
whether
the
same
as
an
refer
--
as
an
ordinary
corporation,
i
would
say
that
the
person
who
is
loaning
this
to
a
number
of
corporations
and
keeps
creating
them
has
his
managerial
functions
are
much
more
complicated,
and
are
much
more
expensive
and
more
--
much
more
regulated.
if
you
organize
a
corporation
once,
that
part
of
it
certainly
is
over.
this
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
the
com
--
the
--
i
said
earlier
that
businesses
consist
of
two
--
to
me
two
and
i
think
the
courts
have
recognized
two
elements.
one
is
as
distinguished
from
an
investment
that
you
enter
into
for
profit.
you
must
have
to
have
continuous
regular
activity.
now,
that
--
this
complexity
of
this
--
of
his
enterprise
and
the
fact
that
he
organized
a
number
of
them
and
financed
them,
and
had
to
watch
the
financing
of
this
and
to
seizure
its
credit
was
--
the
money
was
in
that.
and
its
credit
was
right
and
yet
it
didn't
rely
idle
gave
him
a
full
time,
kept
him
busy
as
a
full
time
business.
the
second
is
that
you
must
create
ordinary
income
through
these
various
activities
and
this
was
his
purpose
was
creation
of
ordinary
income.
and
this
income
is
separate
and
apart
from
the
corporations
themselves.
salaries,
rent,
interest
are
for
services
and
facilities
furnished
to
the
corporations.
they
are
deductible
from
the
corporation's
income
and
as
distinguished
from
dividends
where
--
which
is
the
part
of
an
investment
income
which
comes
to
a
taxpayer
for
his
ownership
in
the
corporation.
and
the
dividend
is
merely
a
distribution
of
the
corporation's
profits
for
which
today
the
tax
laws
give
recognition
to
some
credit
because
they
say
it's
a
double
taxation.
so
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
these
activities
definitely
were
pecuniary
regular
cost
to
those
of
other
businesses
distinguished
from
just
going
in
from
profit
and
they
generate
ordinary
income
separate
and
apart.
now,
the
rule
the
tax
court
however,
unfortunately,
in
spite
of
these
activities
rule
that
you
cannot
be
in
the
business
of
promoting,
organizing,
managing,
and
financing
corporations.
and
i
say
gave
no
consideration
at
all
to
the
extent
of
leasing
operations
with
the
taxpayer
unless
you
form
the
corporations
in
our
course
of
language
for
sale
as
going
businesses
to
customers
in
the
course
of
the
business
of
promoting
them.
now,
certainly
if
you
did
that,
that
would
be
one
method
of
creating
inco
--
ordinary
income
but
it
isn't
the
only
method.
and
such
a
rule
is
to
say
the
respondent
points
out
to
find
people
who
have
corporations
and
inventory
ready
for
sale
is
a
considerably
more
imaginary
than
real.
furthermore,
the
extension
of
the
rule
that
the
--
the
respondent
makes
and
says
that
the
term
dealer
and
enterprises
is
used
by
the
fifth
circuit,
the
majority
in
the
fifth
circuit
would
include
the
promoter
who
forms
the
corporation
for
a
fee
is
equally
unrealistic.
the
promoter
who
forms
the
corporation
for
a
fee
and
then
goes
on
and
forms
another
corporation
is
certainly
not
going
to
be
financing
the
corporations.
and
therefore,
no
question
ever
arises
under
23
(k),
there
is
no
debt
and
because
the
very
definition
of
a
promoter
as
used
by
professor
valentine
in
the
quotation
in
his
brief
is
one
whose
primary
purpose
is
to
got
out
and
seek
other
people
who
will
finance
the
corporations.
and
so
not
only
--
so
the
rule
of
the
lower
courts,
we
submit,
is
not
only
without
reason.
it
is
a
radical
departure
from
as
we
point
at
in
the
first
and
second
points
of
our
original
brief
from
the
established
authorities
and
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress.
it
is
contrary
to
the
long
established
decisions
of
the
tax
court,
acquiesced
in
by
the
commissioner
before
the
1954
revenue
act.
the
revenue
act
of
1954
was
passed
without
substantial
change
at
all
as
acknowledged
by
the
respondent.
that
substantial
change
in
the
wording
of
section
23
(k),
given
a
new
number,
that's
all.
it
--
the
--
and
it
was
contrary
to
the
--
this
is
contrary
as
the
respondent
admits
to
the
decisions
in
the
first,
third,
sixth
and
eighth
circuits
and
the
court
of
claims
the
--
we
submit
that
the
only
circuit
that
supports
his
position
is
the
ninth
as
in
the
holtz
case.
the
respondent
has
cited
in
his
brief
three
cases
in
the
second
circuit,
but
i
guess
overlooked
citing
that
these
three
cases
in
the
second
circuit
has
subsequently
been
substantially
limited
and
modified
in
such
--
by
evident
that
they
have
been
severely
restricted
and
their
application
limited
by
the
letter
--
later
cases
in
the
same
circuit,
second
circuit,
folker
versus
johnson
and
trent
versus
commissioner.
mr.
charles
dillingham
the
second
--
i
would
say
the
question
is
open
in
the
second
circuit.
although,
when
you
read
the
trent
decision
which
gives
a
clear
and
detailed
analysis
of
the
trade
or
business
cases,
you
--
certainly
have
a
decision
and
holdings
in
limiting
these
others
that
are
favorable
to
our
position.
actually,
the
taxpayer
was
allowed
business
bad
debt
in
that
case,
he
had
made
loans.
he
was
an
employee.
he'd
made
loans
to
protect
his
job.
i
see
no
reason
why
a
person
who
makes
loans
to
protect
his
job
but
a
person
who
would
make
loans
to
protect
his
job
is
allowed
to
business
bad
debt
deduction
while
a
person
who
makes
loans
that
create
--
his
job
shouldn't
be.
mr.
charles
dillingham
no.i'm
not
claiming
that
i
would
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
i
don't
feel
that
the
second
circuit
has
had
to
pass
on
the
real
organization
management
and
of
financing
corporation
cases.
now,
this
theory
of
organizing,
managing,
and
financing
corporations
of
business
is
not
my
idea,
this
was
decided
by
the
tax
court
in
bad
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
yes.
mr.
charles
dillingham
yes.
mr.
charles
dillingham
well,
i'm
not
sure
they
wouldn't,
mr.
justice
white.
all
i
said
was
at
least
one
of
his
activities
that
of
organizing
corporations
would
only
be
a
single
transaction.
i'm
saying
--
i
think
that
your
--
that
the
idea
of
going
out
and
promoting
and
organizing
is
one
business
activity
of
the
petitioner,
where
he
has
a
number
of
corporations
that
wouldn't
exist
in
that
case
and
so
our
case
is
strong.
i
don't
believe
that
one
or
single
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
if
that
was
--
i
think
that
that
was
proximately
related
to
his
business
if
his
business
is
organizing
and
financing
and
leasing
to
corporations.
mr.
charles
dillingham
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
only
have
two
minutes
so
i'll
make
two
statements.
as
shown
in
the
brief,
a
question
of
whether
a
person
is
in
a
business
is
a
mixed
question
of
law.
in
fact,
solicitor
general
is
taking
a
long
time
and
the
court's
time
discussing
the
facts.
i
suggest
that
the
reason
is
the
court
has
justified
in
considering
this
case
on
certiorari
is
not
to
determine
the
facts
in
this
case
but
to
whether
congress
intended
to
lay
down
a
rule
that
which
the
lower
courts
say
it
did
by
requiring
that
the
only
way
you
can
get
bad
debt
treatment
is
by
having
corporations
for
sale,
whether
they
intended
a
rule
like
that
to
which
would
threw
these
enterprising,
energetic,
small
businessmen
like
mr.
whipple
in
the
same
category
as
somebody
who
inherited
a
bond
and
kind
of
go
bad
in
a
safe
deposit
box.
now,
this
taxpayer
showed
clearly
in
the
organization
and
management,
and
the
renting
to
and
the
financing
of
his
corporations
that
he
generated
three
other
sources
of
ordinary
income
separate
and
apart
from
that
of
the
corporation.
he's
not
claiming
he's
in
them
--
that
he
is
in
the
corporation's
business
organizing
and
managing
and
financing
corporations
is
not
the
same
as
bottling
drinks.
he's
never
claimed
that.
and
he
--
but
he
did
--
he
did
carry
on
the
same
activities
in
connection
with
mission
orange
as
he
did
with
all
of
these
other
corporations
from
which
he
got
this
$94,000.
he
induced
some
seven
other
people
to
invest
in
it
and
i
don't
know
of
any
relativity
if
it
was
included
in
it
and
he
--
he
was
the
--
he
was
the
active
manager
of
it.
mr.
barnhart
testified,
it's
the
evidence
on
page
116
and
118
will
show.
he
--
mr.
charles
dillingham
that's
right,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
and
he
has
never
claimed
that
he
was
in
the
business
of
organizing
corporations
for
sale.
he
was,
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday,
he
was
offered
the
opportunity
by
the
tax
court
to
present
evidence
that
he
had
--
he
formed
corporations
for
sale
which
under
the
tax
court
rule
would
have
given
him
the
deduction
claim.
he's
been
completely
consistent.
he
organized
these
corporations
not
as
a
promoter.
he
organized
these
corporations
to
operate
them
and
to
furnish
him
with
a
salary
and
rent
and
dividend
income.
and
he
entered
into
a
lease
with
this
corporation
providing
for
$500,000
--
$500
a
month
for
ten
years.
and
as
the
controlling
stockholder
in
this,
had
this
corporation
succeeded,
you
can
be
sure
he
would
have
seen
to
it
that
he
would
have
been
paid
a
salary
and
interest
as
he
--
as
well
as
this
rent,
as
well
as
he
will
--
it
was
in
all
of
the
other
corporations.
