justice
hugo
l.

but
when
you
refer
to
national
standards,
community
standards
--
you
seem
to
refer
to
it
as
synonymous.
what
do
you
understand
by
community
standard?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
whole
country
by
community
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
london,
i
was
interested
naturally
in
your
statement
about
the
jury
and
i
was
also
interested
in
your
further
statement
after
a
precise
charge
given
by
the
court,
paraphrasing
the
sentence
that
came
into
some
disputes
some
years
ago
as
soon
as
circumstances
will
permit,
i
presume
you
mean
as
precise
as
the
circumstances
permit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
statement
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
that
(inaudible)
--
i
don't
under
--
i
thought
you
said
that
congress
couldn't
draw
a
standard.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
could.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
who
would
define
the
national
standards?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
know
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
only
thing
that
bothers
me
is
that
what
you
are
suggesting
is,
there
can
be
a
standard,
established
and
that
congress
can't
do
it,
but
we
can.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
comes
to
me
like,
if
we
are
to
do
the
legislating
for
the
--
for
the
nation
and
take
--
to
say
that
congress
is
incapable
of
doing
it,
but
we
are.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
admitted
to
evidence
to
determine
what
the
national
standard
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
it
has
to
bear
with
each
case
then
according
to
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
determined
a
national
standard
each
time
a
case
is
tried
somewhere
and
it
comes
up
to
us,
we
have
to
look
at
the
evidence
and
see
if
it
established
a
national
standard
of
violating
this
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
the
evidence
there
whether
that
evidence
was
enough
to
show
what
the
national
standard
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
mean,
it
should
in
the
future?
justice
hugo
l.
black
its
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
how
do
you
define
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
some
of
these
statutes
subject
men
to
penitentiary
punishment
for
selling
books
that
may
later
be
found
to
be
obscene?
justice
hugo
l.
black
50?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
50
states
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
subject
him
to
penitentiary
punishment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
we've
held
the
number
of
cases
that
the
facts
that
was
written
so
vaguely
that
a
man
can't
possibly
know
whether
he'd
be
convicted
under
it,
under
this
trial,
is
void
for
violation
of
due
process.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
standard
you've
suggested,
how
could
a
man
know
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
until
he
--
until
he's
tried.
how
can
anybody
know
until
he's
tried?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
some
other
words
could
be
adopted.
if
that's
the
standard
and
you
don't
know
what
it
means
and
nobody
else
knows
what
it
means,
i
think
the
man
who
sells
the
book
know
what
it
means.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
because
it
raises
instead
of
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
man
due
process
for
the
references
--
definition
of
a
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
--
but
certainly
--
but
--
certainly
i
don't
suppose
we're
going
to
wholly
abandon
the
idea
which
has
been
accepted
all
these
years.
so
that
someway,
a
statute
has
to
be
so
--
have
so
much
(inaudible)
to
it
that
the
man
can
at
least
guess
with
reasonable
certainty
whether
he's
going
to
the
penitentiary
if
he
sells
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
other
--
the
case
--
the
roth
case
didn't
purport
to
overrule
(inaudible)
and
in
numerous
cases
in
which
this
court
has
held
to
get
it
forward
in
other
field
not
in
obscenity
maybe.
but
in
other
fields
that
if
crime
must
be
so
definite
and
they've
set
out
that
the
man
can
know
whether
he's
violating
it
or
not.
i
didn't
understand
the
whole
rule
in
roth.
and
now
they've
reached
the
question
as
to
what
is
the
standard.
and
the
standard
you
suggest
or
any
i've
heard
leaves
the
man
in
just
as
much
doubt
that
he
could
possibly
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
held
it
was
not
at
that
time
but
i
assume
this
court
like
all
other
government
agencies
is
open
to
reconsideration
and
resurvey
if
the
efforts
to
enforce
the
law
showed
that
nobody
under
a
certain
standard
show
that
the
man
cannot
possibly
know
what
it
is.
maybe
the
court
is
rigid
and
said,
i
don't
know.
