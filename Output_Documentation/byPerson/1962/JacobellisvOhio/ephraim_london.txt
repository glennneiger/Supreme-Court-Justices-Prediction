mr.
ephraim
london
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
of
the
court.
this
appeal
is
from
an
order
of
the
ohio
supreme
court,
affirming
the
conviction
of
the
appellant
jacobellis
on
two
felony
counts;
one
was
the
possession
of
a
motion
picture
film
that
was
said
to
be
obscene,
the
name
of
the
film
was
“the
lovers”
and
the
other
felony
of
which
he
was
convicted
was
exhibiting
the
film.
jacobellis
was
the
manager
of
a
theater
in
cleveland
heights,
ohio.
he
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
selection
of
pictures.
his
function
was
running
the
theater
physically,
seeing
to
it
that
employees
were
present
and
projecting
the
film
and
so
on.
the
films
were
actually
selected
by
the
owner
of
the
theater
which
by
the
way
was
one
of
the
fairly
large
chains
and
the
owner
was
a
resident
of
ohio.
i
shouldn't
describe
the
film
itself,
the
film
is
in
exhibit
and
i
think
--
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor,
he
knew
the
content
of
the
film.
he
had
shown
it
to
some
critics
before
he
exhibited
it.
and
he
arranged
for
public
exhibition
and
the
point
of
fact,
the
police
chief
called
up
and
asked
about
the
film
when
he
saw
an
ad
for
it,
and
mr.
jacobellis
said,
“come
on
and
see
it,”
invited
him
to
the
first
showing.
the
--
as
i
say,
a
sheriff
described
the
film
itself
except
to
mention
that
particular
objection
seems
to
be
taken
by
the
state
and
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
to
one
sequence
in
the
film
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
not
within
the
range
of
a
camera.
it
takes
place
off
screen.
one
does
not
see
what
is
happening
but
the
state
believes
and
offered
witnesses
to
state
that
they
felt
that
something
that
was
pretty
obscene
was
going
on
out
of
the
camera
range
and
i
think,
your
honor,
this
is
pretty
much
like
saying
that
the
photograph
of
an
apartment
house
has
a
blurry
picture
because
of
what
has
going
on
behind
the
darkened
windows.
mr.
ephraim
london
what
is
on
screen
is
a
woman,
your
honor,
and
you
see
her
face
and
bare
shoulders.
she
is
lying
in
bed,
and
prior
to
that
time,
there
has
been
a
scene
of
love
making
between
the
woman
and
the
man.
you
don't
see
any
act
of
love
but
it's
quite
obvious
that
they
are
making
love
to
each
other
or
at
least
that
they're
in
the
bed
for
that
purpose.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
don't
think
the
analogy
is
exact,
but
one
must
imagine
what
is
going
on
and
when
what
one
cannot
see
in
order
to
say
that
this
particular
sequence
is
obscene.
mr.
ephraim
london
the
advertising
does
in
this
respect
that
i
think
the
state
relies
to
a
very
large
extent
in
order
to
show
intent
and
knowledge
of
obscenity
on
in
the
advertisement
that
appeared
in
a
newspaper.
mr.
ephraim
london
the
owner
of
the
theater.
the
ad
is
made
up,
sometimes
mats
are
supplied.
the
manager
of
the
theater
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
advertisement
but
he
must
place
it
in
a
local
paper
and
of
course
in
placing
it,
he
can
read
the
text
of
the
advertisement
and
the
advertisement
in
this
case
said
that
this
was
the
most
daring
love
story
ever
filmed.
however,
i
think
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
many
advertisements
color
very
highly,
the
content
of
the
film
or
a
book,
and
frequently
exaggerate
the
sexual
appeal.
this
is
--
this
is
almost
standard.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
remember
when
the
guidance
committee
was
conducting
an
investigation
of
pornography,
one
of
their
chief
objections
was
to
the
deceptive
nature
of
the
covers
of
certain
books
which
led
one
to
believe
that
he
was
reading
a
lurid
film
or
buying
it,
when
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
he
was
getting
was
a
classic
so
that
one
could
not
really
have
been
put
on
notice
by
the
content
of
the
advertisement.
i
think
it
should
be
noted
that
this
film
has
won
two
important
international
prizes.
one
was
the
second
prize
at
the
venice
film
festival
where
it
got
the
silver
lion
award,
and
then,
and
the
first
prize
at
a
brazilian
festival.
it
was
said
to
be
one
of
the
best
10
films
of
the
year
by
bosley
crowther,
the
film
critic
of
the
new
york
times,
also
by
hollis
alpert
and
arthur
knight
of
the
saturday
review
of
literature
and
it
was
extremely
well
reviewed
by
the
critic
of
the
herald
tribune
who
testified.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
these
facts
are
all
in
the
record
and
the
point
of
fact,
mr.
beckley
of
the
herald
tribune
did
testify
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
ephraim
london
this
was
a
testimony
in
the
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
well,
the
reviews
that
are
--
the
reviews
that
the
--
the
reviews
that
are
in
record
are
the
reviews
of
mr.
hollis
alpert
and
i
believe
mr.
weiler
of
the
times,
not
mr.
bosley
crowther.
mr.
ephraim
london
it
was
before
a
three-judge
court
without
a
jury,
your
honor.
are
they
entitled
to
a
jury
argument?
mr.
ephraim
london
you
are
entitled
to
a
jury
and
the
jury
was
in
this
case
was
waived.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor
there
was
--
mr.
ephraim
london
there
was
a
request
for
three
judges
and
that
request
was
granted.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
this
was
all
brought
out
on
the
question
generally
of
intent
and
also
in
the
question
of
the
quality
of
the
picture.
mr.
ephraim
london
there
is
no
--
no
objection
on
that
ground,
your
honor.
in
addition
to
the
reviews
that
i
have
mentioned
and
i
should
say
by
the
way
that
mr.
jacobellis,
the
appellant,
was
aware
of
the
reviews
but
was
not
then
aware
of
the
fact
that
this
picture
was
found
to
be
one
of
the
best
10
of
the
year
that
happened
later.
but
he
was
aware
of
the
international
prizes,
he
was
aware
of
the
--
or
at
least
the
major
prize
and
he
was
aware
of
the
reviews
that
had
been
received.
these
usually
come
in
the
form
of
press
clippings
which
are
sent
to
the
theater
manager
by
the
owner
of
the
theater.
there
was
another
factor
of
which
he
was
aware
and
that
is
that
the
customs
bureau
had
examined
this
picture
and
had
made
a
specific
finding
that
the
picture
was
not
obscene.
it
usually
does
not
make
such
a
determination.
it
did
in
this
case
because
it
held
the
film
up
to
customs.
the
film
was
then
apparently
sent
to
the
washington
office
of
the
customs
bureau,
it
was
examined
there,
and
returned
with
the
specific
information
and
advice
that
this
film
was
found
not
obscene
under
the
--
under
the
tariff
law.
mr.
ephraim
london
he
was
aware
of
that.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
he
was
aware
of
those
facts.
he
was
also
--
that
fact,
he
was
also
aware
that
this
film
had
been
shown
either
at
or
near
columbus,
ohio
and
at
or
near
toledo,
ohio.
before
he
showed
it,
there
was
no
incident
in
either
place.
it
happened
that
later
there
was
a
showing
in
dayton,
ohio
and
an
arrest
of
a
theater
manager
there.
mr.
ephraim
london
this
relates
to
two
issues,
your
honor.
one
is
the
question
of
the
obscenity
of
the
film
which
is
a
constitutional
issue
and
i
shouldn't
discuss
that
in
any
length
but
there's
a
related
issue
and
that
is
the
issue
of
what
standards
shall
apply
in
determining
whether
a
film
is
obscene.
this
court
has
said
that
a
film
to
be
determined
obscene
must
be
thought
obscene
according
to
contemporary
community
standards.
now,
the
question
becomes
in
this
case,
should
one
apply
the
standards
of
the
local
community
which
in
this
case
was
cuyahoga
county
or
the
standards
of
the
country
at
large.
i
think
it
is
clear
from
the
record
the
judged
by
the
standards
of
the
nation,
this
film
is
not
obscene.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
--
not
a
requirement,
your
honor
but
the
related
question
which
has
arisen
in
this
court
two
or
three
times,
but
is
not
yet
been
determined
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor,
but
i
think
we
can
go
beyond
the
determination
of
the
court.
they
merely
said
that
this
film
was
obscene
according
to
community
standards
and
didn't
say
what
the
community
was.
but
if
we
look
at
the
record,
we
will
find
that
the
only
testimony
that
this
picture
offended
community
standards
was
testimony
relating
specifically
to
cuyahoga
county.
the
questions
were
asked
about
what
the
people
in
that
county
thought
and
felt
and
believed
in
relation
to
a
film
of
this
kind.
mr.
ephraim
london
these
were
critics
who
wrote
and
published
in
cleveland
in
the
same
county.
mr.
ephraim
london
there
was
--
there
was
a
one
lady
from
the
national
review,
this
and
was
not
a
national
magazine.
mr.
ephraim
london
the
hollywood
writer,
your
honor,
i
believe
was
those
mr.
hunt
and
mr.
marsh
were
the
two
critics
who
testified
other
the
critic
from
the
national
review.
mr.
ephraim
london
may
i
say
for
a
moment,
your
honor,
that
i
have
taken
exception
to
the
publication
of
that
particular
review
as
an
appendix
to
the
brief
from
the
ground
that
it
had
been
offered
in
evidence
and
then
withdrawn
by
the
state.
i
thought
it
had
no
part
of
the
appellee's
brief
and
i
don't
think
it
ought
to
be
considered
by
the
court.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
there's
even
a
discussion
in
the
record
when
there
was
an
attempt
to
introduce
evidence
of
standards
in
another
area
where
the
prosecutor
made
a
point
that
the
only
relevant
standards
were
the
standards
of
cuyahoga
county.
mr.
ephraim
london
no
express
ruling
of
the
court,
your
honor.
i
just
say
that
this
court
has
of
course
an
obligation
to
go
into
the
record
where
the
question
is
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
is
raised.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
it
was
--
it
was
made
an
issue
at
the
trial,
your
honor
because
for
one
thing,
all
of
the
testimony
that
the
prosecutor
offered
was
testimony
with
respect
to
the
local
standards.
i
think
the
other
testimony
indicated
and
all
the
testimony
of
national
standards
that
i
have
spoken
of
indicated
that
so
far
as
the
standards
of
the
people
at
large
were
concerned,
this
was
not
an
obscene
film,
that
it
had
shown
for
example
in
a
hundred
major
cities
in
the
united
states,
and
that
in
none
of
those
cities
had
there
been
any
objection
to
the
showing
of
the
film.
now,
i
should
indicate
that
there
were
two
or
three
cases
where
there
was
objection
taken
to
the
film.
this
happened
in
oregon
and
this
happened
in
chicago.
in
both
cases,
the
manager
of
the
theater
ultimately
prevailed
and
the
owner
of
the
film.
the
film
was
shown
without
finally
in
the
last
analysis
without
further
complaint.
mr.
ephraim
london
your
honor,
you
do
remember
correctly,
some
half-minute
of
testimony
was
taken
out
of
the
version
that
showed
in
new
york
and
boston.
it
was
licensed
in
new
york
with
one
half
minute
less.
the
witnesses
who
testified
with
respect
to
the
two
versions
said
they
saw
no
difference.
that
is
the
only
testimony
with
respect
to
those
--
to
that
change.
and
the
point
of
fact,
a
half-minute
change
could
make
very
little
difference
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
i
think
at
some
three
minutes
that
is
objected
to
and
it's
the
--
as
i
say
the
testimony
was
that
there
was
no
difference
in
reality
between
the
two
versions
and
the
full
version
that
was
objected
to
here
was
shown
in
chicago,
was
shown
in
detroit,
was
shown
in
michigan
and
was
shown
in
many
other
places.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
the
issue
was
here
in
the
evidence,
on
all
of
the
evidence.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes
your
honor,
you
do
have
some
witnesses
--
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
i
think
it
was
just
mentioned
just
casually
on
cross-examination
that
there
had
been
some
difficulty
in
oregon
and
ultimately,
the
owner
of
the
film
prevailed.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
go
further
and
say
that
the
evidence
was
so
overwhelming
that
it
was
not
obscene
that
i
think
that
we
can
take
this
and
i
have
mentioned
my
reasons,
the
fact
that
it
is
shown
in
as
many
places
as
it
was,
i
think
is
a
pretty
clear
indication
that
the
picture
did
not
offend
the
standards
in
the
cities
that
i've
mentioned.
mr.
ephraim
london
the
question
of
community
standards
was
raised
and
i
believe
in
a
different
way
and
i
cannot
speak
of
the
argument
because
i
wasn't
--
i
didn't
argue
the
appeal.
mr.
ephraim
london
the
brief,
i
think,
very
clearly
raises
the
issue
of
the
matter
of
community
standards,
as
to
the
appellants
brief
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
mr.
ephraim
london
they
too
do
not
state
but
i
don't
see
what
in
the
record
they
could
have
relied
upon
if
they
were
going
to
find
that
this
film
violated
the
national
standards
of
decency.
mr.
ephraim
london
well,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
ephraim
london
that's
perfectly
true,
your
honor,
but
it's
also
true
that
this
as
it's
been
said
in
this
court
that
this
court
must
itself
make
its
own
judgment
with
respect
to
obscenity
and
i
don't
know
how
this
court
could
apply
the
standards
of
cuyahoga
county.
mr.
ephraim
london
that
may
very
well
be
but
to
the
extent
that
national
standards
would
show
us
here
that
the
film
is
not
obscene,
i
think
they
must
be
applied.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
well,
one
of
the
difficulties
we
have
is
that
the
test
of
obscenity
or
the
determination
of
obscenity
is
a
constitutional
judgment
that
each
judge
must
independently
make
as
i
understand
the
opinions
in
this
court.
mr.
ephraim
london
my
point
amounts
to
this
that
--
that
this
--
mr.
ephraim
london
and
i
am
stating
now
that
this
court,
in
making
the
judgment
of
obscenity,
should
apply
the
national
standards
of
decency
and
that
according
to
those
standards,
this
film
is
not
obscene.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
you're
bound
by
the
fact
--
by
the
evidence
in
the
record,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
even
if
you
--
in
your
personal
judgment,
you
felt
this
was
film
obscene,
you
would
still
have
or
should
rule.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
wasn't
speaking
about
opinion
evidence.
i
was
speaking
about
fact,
your
honor.
i
was
speaking
on
the
fact
of
this
film.
mr.
ephraim
london
the
fact
that
this
film
has
been
shown
in
so
many
places
and
has
been
accepted.
i
think
this
is
the
fact.
this
is
proof
of
community
standards.
i
don't
know
what
stronger
proof
we
could
have.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
that
this
would
have
been
inevitable.
it
was
widely
advertised.
the
police
were
aware
of
it
in
every
community.
there
was
no
attempt
to
conceal
the
showing,
not
several
as
it
was
not
done
as
an
obscene
thing.
it
was
shown
so
that
everyone
could
see
it.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor,
i
think
--
then
you
must
still
exercise
your
own
judgment
according
to
the
decisions
or
the
opinion
of
this
court.
mr.
ephraim
london
the
constitutional
judgment
would
be
to
determine
whether
this
is
obscene
within
the
standards
that
you
have
laid
out.
mr.
ephraim
london
well,
that's
just
one
because
i
believe
that
it's
possible
for
a
film
to
have
been
thought
obscene
by
a
great
many
communities
and
yet
this
court
might
consider
the
work
of
such
value
that
you
could
not
ban
it
as
obscene.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor,
i
cannot.
mr.
ephraim
london
because
according
to
the
definition
that
you
have
laid
out,
this
film
is
not
obscene.
mr.
ephraim
london
i'm
saying
in
the
last
analysis
is
of
course
the
judgment
of
this
court,
but
i
also
say
that
the
court
should
be
guided
by
its
own
determinations
in
the
past
to
the
effect
that
the
community
standard
should
be
applied
and
we
have
proof
of
community
standards
here
in
the
actual
exhibition.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
didn't
indicate,
your
honor
that
they
ought
to
be
disregarded.
i
meant
to
indicate
that
they
were
not
controlling,
but
there
might
be
other
factors
that
--
this
court
has
outlined
several
criteria.
the
community
standards
is
one,
if
in
any
respect,
the
film
does
not
meet
the
criteria
of
obscenity
then
it
is
not
obscene.
mr.
ephraim
london
the
standards
are
these
--
that
the
work
must
be
judged
as
a
whole.
i'm
not
going
to
go
into
that
but
this
film
was
not
judged
as
a
whole.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
would
think
your
honor
that
the
same
apply.
the
criteria
--
mr.
ephraim
london
no
but
i
think
that
the
court
has
actually
--
i
would
change
my
answer,
yes,
your
honor.
it
has
been
held
so
by
this
court
in
times
--
the
first
times
film
case
against
chicago
where
the
court
overruled
a
determination
in
chicago
on
the
grounds
of
the
roth
case
indicating
that
the
roth
case
did
apply
to
motion
picture
films.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
film
would
finally
have
to
be
determined
by
its
dominant
effect.
and
if
you
went
away
from
the
film,
feeling
that
it
was
a
dirty
picture
then
it
would
be
an
obscene
picture.
and
if
you
went
away
felling
that
the
dominant
effect
was
the
portrayal
of
rebecca
of
sunnybrook
farm
that
there
were
three
minutes
that
were
revolting,
i
would
end
up
by
saying
that
this
was
a
--
this
was
not
an
obscene
film
according
to
your
judgment.
mr.
ephraim
london
that
doesn't
mean
that
a
particular
part
may
not
so
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
and
dominate
the
picture
that
it
would
not
be
judged
but
on
--
as
it
happened
in
this
particular
case,
the
ohio
supreme
court
found
the
picture
as
a
whole
is
extremely
dull.
mr.
ephraim
london
we
have
no
evidence
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
don't
believe
other
than
the
opinion
that
they
are
required
to
do.
i
may
be
mistaken
about
that.
mr.
ephraim
london
from
the
evidence
in
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
only
from
the
evidence.
mr.
ephraim
london
from
the
evidence
in
the
record
and
from
the
--
from
the
clear
evidence
to
the
contrary
with
respect
to
national
standards.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
we
must
take
the
record
as
we
find
it
--
mr.
ephraim
london
unfortunately,
there
was
not
a
jury
here
and
there
were
no
specific
instructions
on
that
issue.
we
can
tell
about
the
mental
operation
of
the
judge
but
we
do
know
the
evidence
we've
had
before
them.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
the
reference
that
i
made
before
was
to
the
opinion
of
the
ohio
supreme
court.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor,
they
recited
the
test.
mr.
ephraim
london
accepting
your
honor,
i
submit,
that
they
could
not
have
met
the
test
with
respect
to
community
standards.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
there's
no
contraction
of
that
evidence.
mr.
ephraim
london
we
do
in
this
record,
your
honor.
i
have
recited
the
--
and
shown
wherein
each
witnesses
testimony
this
question
of
the
community
was
stressed
and
the
community
was
that
of
the
cuyahoga
county.
they
were
not
talking
now
then
of
national
standards.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
understand
the
term
that
the
court
used
when
it
meant
community
standards
was
this
nation,
the
people
of
this
country.
and
now
they
--
mr.
ephraim
london
not
the
people
of
each
state,
not
the
people
of
each
locality
because
i
think
that
if
we
were
to
determine
--
use
the
standards
of
a
particular
locality,
we
would
be
imposing
such
a
burden
on
communication
that
it
would
make
it
almost
impossible
to
publish
periodicals,
books
and
even
films.
you
can't
make
a
separate
film
or
separate
version
of
the
film
for
cuyahoga
county
but
you
can
make
--
mr.
ephraim
london
this
can
be
proved
by
other
means
as
i
think
they
were
here.
mr.
ephraim
london
may
i
call
your
honor's
attention
of
the
fact
there
was
a
dissenting
opinion
in
the
companion
case,
the
alberts
case
which
indicated
that
different
standards
should
be
applied
when
the
court
was
ruling
on
a
determination
made
by
a
state
and
i
assume
that
because
it
was
in
dissent
that
the
majority
of
the
court
was
of
the
other
view
and
--
mr.
ephraim
london
it
may
have
been.
mr.
ephraim
london
well,
this
was
my
own
interpretation
and
i'm
pleased
that
your
honor
agrees.
thank
you.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
always
before
a
jury,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
i
was
not
the
trial
counsel.
mr.
ephraim
london
well,
the
court
has
indicated
that
it
was
a
mistake
and
i
would
myself
feel
that
i
prefer
the
jury
and
i
prefer
the
jury
to
have
a
precise
charge
from
the
judge
as
to
what
controlling
law
is
and
i
believe
in
the
jury
system.
i
very
much
prefer
the
jury
and
i
would
think
that
my
experience
in
this
field
is
perhaps
been
wider
than
that
of
anybody
else
in
united
states.
mr.
ephraim
london
this
has
been
--
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
this
is
of
necessity
and
inaccurate
statement,
your
honor,
but
my
informed
guess
is
about
30.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
again,
i
couldn't
verify
this.
i
can
and
i
think
i
--
mr.
ephraim
london
three,
your
honor,
but
as
i
say
in
all
cases,
the
owner
of
the
film
prevailed.
i
should
in
candor
indicate
that
there
is
one
state
where
the
picture
was
offered
for
license
where
the
--
a
change
was
demanded
which
the
owner
of
the
film
refused
to
make
and
so
the
film
did
not
show
in
that
state.
i
believe
that
was
virginia,
but
that
of
course
is
not
--
mr.
ephraim
london
the
only
one
is
that
i
indicated
before
of
something
like
191
feet,
a
half
minute
about
31
seconds
of
actual
playing
time
which
was
removed
from
the
new
york
version
and
i
believe
also
from
the
boston
version.
thereafter,
the
owner
of
the
film
decided
he
would
not
make
any
concession.
and
--
mr.
ephraim
london
no
any,
not
even
that
one
and
to
my
knowledge
he
did
not.
mr.
ephraim
london
it
was
a
full
version
that
played
all
over
in
ohio.
mr.
ephraim
london
as
précised
as
the
circumstances
permit,
i
think
that
the
court
has
agreed
that
this
is
of
necessity
of
vague
definition.
mr.
ephraim
london
they
seemed
to
be
using
a
combination
of
both
and
the
most
recent
one
that
was
proposed
in
texas.
on
this
very
question
of
community
standards
indicated
that
they
would
have
to
use
community
standards
with
the
standards
of
the
community,
that
the
word
“community”
would
mean
an
area
not
less
than
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
ephraim
london
it
was
--
there
was
a
prosecution
in
portland,
oregon
which
as
i
say
was
ultimately
unsuccessful.
there
was
a
prosecution
in
--
or
there
was
refusal
to
license
in
chicago
that
was
ultimately
reversed
and
then
there
was
the
prosecution
in
ohio.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
this
film
was
shown
in
chicago
in
the
full
version
and
i
think
the
court
may
perhaps
take
judicial
notice
that
the
regulations
in
chicago
are
more
stringent
than
they
are
in
most
of
the
states.
there
was
a
specific
finding
of
--
most
of
the
cities,
i'm
sorry,
there
was
a
specific
finding
in
the
ruling
by
the
local
board
that
this
film
is
not
obscene
under
the
chicago
limits.
mr.
ephraim
london
oh
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
one
of
the
places
that
was
named
in
the
testimony.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
there
isn't
any
that
i
know
of.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
say
that.
i
do
think
though
that
the
determination
by
the
customs
bureau
had
some
effect.
mr.
ephraim
london
had
some
effect
and
i
think
that
they
are
certainly
--
they
must
have
been
attempting
to
use
the
national
standards
of
decency.
thank
you.
mr.
ephraim
london
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
if
the
court
please,
this
is
a
reargument
of
an
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
affirming
the
conviction
of
jacobellis,
the
appellant,
on
two
counts.
one
count
was
for
possession
of
a
film,
motion
picture
film,
that
was
found
by
the
court
to
be
obscene
and
the
other
count
was
for
showing
or
exhibiting
the
film.
the
picture
that's
involved
in
this
case
is
the
motion
picture
called
“lovers.”
the
first
question
that's
presented
by
the
appeal
is
whether
or
not
this
picture
is
obscene,
if
it
is
not
obscene
under
constitutional
standards.
that's
an
end
of
the
case.
and
to
make
that
or
to
consider
that
question,
i
think
we
must
first
consider
the
standards
by
which
a
film
must
be
judged
and
i
should
add
that
i
don't
think
that
this
film
can
be
judged
obscene
by
any
constitutionally
acceptable
standards.
but
the
criteria
for
judgment
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
film
is
obscene
are
set
out
in
roth
and
alberts.
but
the
highest
courts
of
the
various
states
had
considerable
difficulty
in
applying
those
standards.
and
there
are
many
questions
that
have
been
raised
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
the
roth-alberts
standards.
the
first
question
in
which
there
have
been
differences
of
opinion
in
the
state
courts
is
whether
it
was
intended
by
the
roth-alberts
decision
to
allow
the
suppression
of
punishment
of
only
what
is
termed
hardcore
pornography.
and
i
hope
that
that
i
won't
be
asked
to
define
that
term
but
it's
been
used
by
many
of
the
courts
and
i
understand
that
to
mean
that
which
is
not
only
obscene
but
so
flagrantly,
patently,
blatantly
obscene.
that
there
could
be
no
difference
of
opinion
between
men
of
--
whose
opinion
is
to
be
respected
between
reputable
people
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
that
matter
is
actually
obscene
or
not.
mr.
ephraim
london
well,
i
assume
that
the
society
is
ours
and
i
think
we're
going
to
have
to
explore
that
question
too
because
that
question
of
which
society
is
to
be
the
judge
or
according
to
the
standards
of
which
society
is
another
matter
that
is
involved
here.
and
there's
also
another
matter
about
which
the
state
courts
differ
in
connection
with
a
specific
application
of
the
term
community
standards,
what
the
community
has
intended
to
be.
but
if
i
may
speak
first
to
the
question
of
hardcore
pornography,
i
take
it
from
reading
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
that
have
related
to
punishment
of
--
of
matter
found
to
or
suspected
or
charged
of
violating
federal
law.
that
something
like
the
standard
of
hardcore
pornography
does
apply
where
a
federal
statute
is
involved
and
where
a
federal
prosecution
is
involved.
i've
made
that
assumption
from
a
reading
of
the
various
cases
that
this
court
has
--
has
determined,
some
without
opinion
and
such
cases
as
manual
against
day
where
the
--
certainly,
the
--
at
least
one
of
the
opinions
is
very
clear
in
indicating
that
only
what
was
patently
offensive
and
obnoxious
would
be
considered
obscene.
in
relation
to
a
federal
case
and
the
question
is
whether
the
same
rule
will
apply
where
there
is
a
state
prosecution.
none
of
course
relates
to
the
very
much
broader
question
as
to
whether
the
first
amendment
means
the
same
thing
in
a
state
prosecution
as
it
does
in
a
federal
prosecution.
mr.
ephraim
london
of
the
manager
of
the
theater.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
the
punishment
was
the
fine
of
$500
on
one
count
and
the
maximum
fine
of
$2000
on
another
count.
the
court
had
the
option
of
either
imposing
a
fine
or
an
indeterminate
prison
sentence
of
not
less
than
one
or
more
than
seven
years.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
the
--
the
fine
has
not
been
paid
and
there
is
a
workhouse
sentence
but
the
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
fine
isn't
there.
mr.
ephraim
london
now,
before
going
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
federal
standards
are
to
apply
here
in
a
state
prosecution,
i
think
i
--
i
should
state
and
i
think
the
record
clearly
indicates
that
if
this
were
a
federal
prosecution,
this
motion
picture
could
not
possibly
be
considered
obscene
under
the
standards
that
have
been
followed
by
this
court
in
a
federal
prosecution.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
and
as
i
--
as
i
indicated,
i
have
some
questions
--
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
no,
your
honor
but
i
believe
in
your
opinion
in
manual
against
day,
that
particular
term
was
used
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
indicating
that
the
--
that
the
criteria
that
had
been
set
out
in
your
opinion
of
--
of
patent
offensiveness
was
somehow
equivalent
or
close
to
what
the
state
courts
call
hardcore
pornography.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
--
i
said
before
that
i
had
indicated
my
understanding
of
the
federal
standards
from
a
consideration
of
the
various
cases
that
this
court
has
passed
upon
many
without
opinion.
for
example,
the
--
the
mounts
(ph)
case,
the
one
case
where
there
was
material
involved
which
i
think
would
be
considered
obscene
perhaps
by
other
standards
and
where
perhaps
the
court
might
have
--
might
have
been
--
where
--
where
i
think
it
was
pretty
clear
that
the
court
was
insisting
that
the
work
be
more
than
merely
what
is
--
might
ordinarily
be
considered
obscene.
but
as
i
stated
before
this
picture
that
we
have
here
couldn't
possibly
under
the
--
what
i
conceive
to
be
the
federal
standards
be
judged
obscene
and
constitutionally
punishable
or
suppressible.
it's
a
picture
that
has
been
examined
by
a
number
of
censorship
boards
that
are
in
the
business
of
detecting
obscenity
and
passed
by
them
ultimately,
found
to
be
not
obscene
by
at
least
six
or
seven
of
them.
mr.
ephraim
london
this
picture
has
been
banned
in
only
one
place,
not
even
a
state.
this
picture
has
been
banned
only
in
--
in
two
places
rather
in
ohio,
in
dayton,
ohio
and
in
cleveland
heights,
ohio.
mr.
ephraim
london
oh
yes,
it
showed
four
and
a
half
months
in
columbus,
ohio.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor,
it's
in
exhibit
in
this
case.
and
of
course
available
for
the
court's
examination
but
it
was
passed
by
censorship
boards
in
maryland,
by
censorship
boards
in
providence,
by
censorship
board
finally
in
chicago,
in
new
york
and
boston.
now
some
question
has
been
raised
as
to
whether
new
york
and
boston,
not
the
other
places
that
i've
mention
but
new
york
and
boston
have
seen
a
revised
version
and
the
fact
is
that
they
did
see
a
version
that
is
131
feet
less
which
is
less
than
a
minute
showing
time,
131
feet
less
than
the
version
that
was
shown
in
chicago,
the
version
that
was
shown
in
columbus,
ohio
and
the
version
that
is
being
prosecuted
today.
there
is
that
difference,
however,
the
witnesses
and
the
record
shows
that
there
is
no
--
no
one
could
detect
any
real
difference
between
the
two
versions.
the
only
--
mr.
ephraim
london
you've
got
the
one
with
the
additional
131
feet.
mr.
ephraim
london
unexpurgated,
unchanged.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
the
131
feet
were
taken
out
as
a
kind
of
sort
to
a
censor
board
which
objected
to
the
--
the
passing
of
the
film
initially
and
then
compromised
on
the
taking
out
of
the
hundred
and
--
mr.
ephraim
london
pardon
me?
mr.
ephraim
london
not
the
whole
scene,
your
honor,
less
than
a
half
a
minute
of
the
scene.
mr.
ephraim
london
that
was
the
only
part
of
the
film
that
was
challenged.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
that
the
court
can
judge
it
out
of
context.
and
i
--
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
court,
it
cannot.
it
would
be
required
to
look
at
the
entire
film
to
--
to
understand
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--that
sequence.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
i
--
i
would
like
to
make
that
clear.
i
don't
think
that
there
was
any
difference
whatever
between
the
version
that
was
licensed
in
new
york
and
the
version
that
was
shown
in
boston
and
the
version
that
was
--
is
now
in
court.
and
that
was
--
is
being
prosecuted
or
was
prosecuted
by
the
ohio
authority.
mr.
ephraim
london
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
that
the
board
originally
that
requested
the
deletion
and
requested
a
larger
deletion,
the
distributor
refused
to
make
it
and
this
was
a
compromise.
later
on,
the
distributor
refused
to
make
that
compromise
and
decided
he
wasn't
going
to
change
it
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
chicago,
he
refused
to
--
to
make
any
deletion
and
the
film
was
finally
passed
in
the
version
that
is
now
before
this
court.
and
again,
in
columbus,
ohio
when
it
was
shown,
the
version
that
is
now
before
this
court
was
shown.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
but
critics
who
saw
both
the
changed
version
and
the
full
version
said
they
saw
no
difference
between
the
two
films
and
saw
them
both.
mr.
ephraim
london
it
was
tried
by
a
three-judge
court.
mr.
ephraim
london
there
could
have
been
a
jury.
i
did
not
try
the
case.
mr.
ephraim
london
there
could've
been
a
jury
and
the
jury
would
waive
trial
by
a
three
judge
court,
was
requested
and
granted.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
don't
know
that
it's
become
the
practice,
your
honor.
i
--
i
myself
do
not
waive
a
jury
in
a
case
of
this
kind.
but
as
i
was
indicating
before,
i
think
that
if
you
apply
federal
standards,
this
film
cannot
be
banned.
it
had
played
in
addition
to
what
i
had
mentioned
before,
that
played
in
a
hundred
different
major
cities
in
the
united
states,
a
total
of
44
states.
mr.
ephraim
london
including
washington,
d.c.
and
it
had
won
numerous
prizes.
it
had
been
recommended,
i
shouldn't
say
numerous
prizes,
two
prizes.
it
had
been
recommended
and
nominated
for
an
award
as
one
of
the
ten
best
films,
not
only
by
the
new
york
times
but
by
the
saturday
review
of
literature,
i
think
three
different
critics
had
--
had
made
that
recommendation.
now,
the
question
of
--
of
whether
or
not
the
first
amendment
standards
can
vary
from
state
to
state,
there's
never
been
specifically
passed
upon
by
this
court.
and
that
is
the
appellant's
position
here
that
the
standards
are
the
same
whether
the
prosecution
is
by
the
federal
or
by
a
state
government.
as
i
understand
it,
the
--
it
is
the
first
amendment,
whether
it
has
become
part
of
the
fourteenth
by
incorporation
or
whether
by
absorption.
it
is
still
the
first
amendment
that
has
become
applicable
to
the
states.
and
the
first
amendment
right,
i
should
not
think
would
vary
from
state
to
state.
i
think
it
has
been
--
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
took
the
same
position
also
but
i
--
none
as
clearly
as
did
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
in
the
hudson
county
case.
there
is
an
excellent
exposition
which
is
not
quoted
in
my
brief
but
i
think
that
the
whole
question,
i
--
i
think
there
is
an
excellent
--
excellent
statement
of
the
question
and
discussion
of
it
in
that
new
jersey
case.
now
in
relation
to
the
application
of
national
standards
again,
with
respect
to
the
criterion
of
community
standards,
the
roth
case
says
that
a
work,
if
it
is
to
be
judged
or
one
is
to
judge
whether
or
not
it
is
obscene
must
be
judged
according
to
community
standards
and
the
question
as,
what
is
meant
by
the
term
community.
is
it,
as
the
new
jersey
court
suggested,
national
standards?
in
a
state
prosecution,
is
it
the
state
standards?
is
it
the
county
in
which
the
defendant
is
being
prosecuted
or
as
if
no
community
at
all
as
the
state
of
kansas
has
suggested
in
its
brief
in
the
following
case.
the
--
the
state
of
kansas
suggest
that
society
at
large
as
--
as
its
standards
are
interpreted
by
a
particular
judge
or
a
jury,
is
the
community
that
the
court
intended
in
roth
against
united
states.
mr.
ephraim
london
if
your
honor
please,
i
am
not
going
to
try
to
defend
that
position.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
had
that
question
in
mind
when
it
enunciated
the
--
the
standards
in
roth
against
the
united
states
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
any
other
standards
can
be
applied
consistently
with
the
first
amendment
rights.
perhaps,
that
--
perhaps,
that
term
should
be
modified
or
changed.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
--
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
i
would
say
that
the
first
amendment
would've
come
in
to
the
fourteenth
intact
and
not
varying
as
one
crosses
the
state
line
or
as
one
crosses
a
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
would
think
that
would
be
--
that
would
not
be
consistent
with
the
--
with
the
first
amendment
protection
your
honor.
i
think
if
that
is
the
definition
that
is
adopted,
then
i
think
that
definition
calls
afoul
of
the
first
amendment
right
of
freedom
of
speech.
to
me,
the
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
that
question
is
directly
involved,
yes
your
honor.
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
that
would
certainly
indicate
your
--
your
honor
that
the
court
intended
the
same
sentence
to
be
use
in
both
the
federal
and
state
prosecution,
i
would
--
i
had
made
that
assumption
also
from
the
fact
that
there
was
a
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
by
mr.
justice
harlan
in
which
he
objected
of
the
use
of
the
same
standard
in
the
two
types
of
cases.
and
i
think
there
was
some
other
language
in
the
roth
opinions
supporting
that
view.
i
think
that
the
court
indicated
in
roth
and
alberts
that
the
first
amendment
right
applied
with
equal
vigor.
i
think
that
was
the
phrase
the
court
used
as
against
the
federal
government
and
the
states.
and
if
it
is
to
apply
--
to
apply
with
equal
vigor,
then
i
believe
that
the
federal
standards
must
be
used
when
one
judges
even
a
state
prosecution.
mr.
ephraim
london
the
--
mr.
ephraim
london
the
question
of
determining
the
standards
is
--
is
your
honor
an
extremely
difficult
one
and
poses
many
problems.
and
i
suppose
that
one
way
of
--
one
way
of
determining
these
problems
in
a
given
case
is
to
find
out
what
people
are
reading,
people
are
looking
at
throughout
the
united
states,
what
they
are
tolerating,
what
they
are
accepting
in
this
particular
case
the
problem
is
a
very
easy
one.
we
here
have
a
case
that
--
were
picture
has
been
shown
in
100
different
important
cities
which
is
practically
the
entire
number
of
cities
in
which
it
would
be
shown
normally
whether
or
not
it
was
obscene
there
is
a
limited
market
for
films
that
are
called
art
films
and
this
is
one
of
them,
it's
a
fine
film
it
normally
would
not
be
shown
in
many
more
than
100
different
large
cities.
shown
in
100
cities
and
44
states,
i
should
think
there
that
there
is
a
clear
--
one
doesn't
have
to
go
very
much
beyond
that
to
determine
that
this
is
accepted
nationally.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
that
the
jury
would
have
to
have
some
evidence
before
or
it
should
have
some
evidence
before
it.
mr.
ephraim
london
uninstructed
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
--
i
imagine
that
this
would
depend
a
great
deal
on
a
particular
jury
in
a
particular
case.
but
this
is
a
problem.
mr.
ephraim
london
well
each
--
each
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
one
draws
from
his
own
knowledge
and
experience
and
background
in
making
a
determination.
but
i
believe
that
properly
instructed
the
jury
might
certainly
follow
a
judge's
direction
to
consider
the
standards
of
the
nation.
and
in
the
given
case,
it
maybe
possible
in
--
in
this
case
it's
certainly
is
possible
to
prove
what
the
national
standards
are.
mr.
ephraim
london
to
my
thinking
not
more
than
of
jury.
mr.
ephraim
london
to
my
thinking
you
couldn't
depend
on
the
judge's
decision
anymore
than
you
could
on
the
juries
without
instructions.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
don't
think
that
congress
could
possibly
to
legislate
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
a
standard
which
would
be
effective
the
following
day
because
the
standards
of
the
country
changed
from
time
to
time.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
realistically
there
will
be
a
difference.
i
think
also
that
if
the
jury
does
not
take
the
facts
into
consideration,
there
are
always
appellate
courts
which
can
correct
an
error.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
here
the
court
would
be
--
would
be
compelled
virtually.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
would
think
that
that
in
a
--
in
an
appropriate
prosecution
the
national
standards,
under
the
court's
definition,
that
the
national
standards
should
be
proved.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
some
attempt
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
would
think
this
is
an
affirmative
part
of
the
--
of
the
people's
case
in
the
prosecution
of
the
work
that
is
obscene
under
this
court's
definition.
mr.
ephraim
london
well
if
--
if
your
honor
is
suggesting
that
the
--
that
the
standards
are
the
same
throughout
the
country,
i
would
beg
to
differ.
mr.
ephraim
london
would
not
--
that
there
is
no
difference,
but
that
--
what
the
particular
standards
are
that
the
standards
are
in
a
given
case
that
the
--
that
according
to
the
national
standards,
this
--
this
particular
word
would
offend
the
national
standards
of
decency.
i
think
this
would
be
a
part
of
the
--
of
the
affirmative
case.
or
in
any
event,
it's
certainly
a
relevant
consideration.
mr.
ephraim
london
well
your
honor
the
only
--
the
only
kind
of
expression
that
is
--
that
is
prohibited
or
punished
is
obscenity.
all
other,
it
allowed.
and
so
this
is
the
only
area
in
which
the
question
arises.
mr.
ephraim
london
couldn't
legislate
the
standard,
yes
sir.
mr.
ephraim
london
not
that
your
honor
can
legislate
the
standard
but
that
your
--
but
that
a
court
with
the
information
before
it
can
determine
that
the
national
--
that
according
to
the
national
standard.
mr.
ephraim
london
but
this
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
--
i
think
that
in
--
in
many
instances
of
the
--
if
the
record
doesn't
show
it,
this
court
has
made
a
determination
as
to
what
the
standards
were
and
obviously,
i
believe,
we're
not
applying
the
standards
of
a
local
community
as
for
example
in
the
times
film
case,
the
first
times
film
case
that
came
from
chicago
this
court
reversed.
a
--
a
--
suppression
of
a
film
whether
--
it
was
held
that
the
film
was
obscene
and
i
am
assuming
that
no
member
of
this
court
was
applying
the
standards
of
illinois
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
when
that
determination
was
made.
pardon
me.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
am
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
--
i
didn't
state
my
position
clearly.
what
i
intended
to
say
your
honor
was
that
it
is
possible
for
one
to
prove
in
a
given
case
that
there
is
a
national
standard
of
decency
and
that
according
to
the
national
standard
a
particular
work
could
not
be
held
to
violate
that
standard.
now,
i
say
that
this
--
mr.
ephraim
london
pardon?
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor
and
i
--
i
submit
that
this
case
was
the
perfect
example
of
one
in
which
it
can
be
done.
now
there
maybe
others
in
which
it
will
be
difficult
but
this
is
the
court's
definition
of
what
is
obscene
and
how
obscenity
is
to
be
judged.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
each
case
is
an
individual
case,
there's
no
question
about
it,
this
court
has
said
so.
mr.
ephraim
london
under
--
mr.
ephraim
london
under
the
laws
it
now
stands,
i
think
that
your
honor
has
to
--
i
mean
the
court
must
--
must
judge
in
accordance
with
some
standard.
mr.
ephraim
london
well,
i
believe
it
has
in
the
past.
mr.
ephraim
london
in
--
mr.
ephraim
london
in
citing
--
in
citing
the
roth-alberts
case
which
set
out
these
standards,
i
assume
that
the
court
applied
those
standards.
mr.
ephraim
london
no
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
that
--
that
is
--
that
is
so
your
honor.
i
am
--
i
am
indicating
however
that
the
several
of
the
highest
courts
have
indicated
that
the
criteria
that
was
set
out
in
roth-alberts,
and
now
according
to
massachusetts'
court
is
a
dim
beacon.
and
i
think
that
the
courts
have
in
effect
asked
the
explication.
by
the
way,
that
was
the
only
thing
on
which
the
--
the
majority
in
dissenting
opinion
agreed
in
the
case
that
i'm
quoting
namely
that
--
that
they
didn't
have
a
sufficiently
clear
course
--
clear
light
by
which
to
guide
their
cause.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
wouldn't
your
honor.
i'm
--
i'm
afraid
my
opinion
would
follow
justice
black's.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
believe
that
is
--
that
is
my
own
opinion
which
your
honor
asked
for.
mr.
ephraim
london
that
would
have
to
be
determined
in
a
given
case.
in
manual
against
day
for
example,
the
--
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
would
instruct
the
jury
that
in
determining
whether
a
given
work
is
obscene.
they
must
make
that
determination
not
in
accordance
with
their
own
concepts
or
the
concepts
of
the
people
living
in
their
neighborhood
or
even
if
the
state
but
to
the
extent
that
that
has
been
proved
in
accordance
with
the
standards
of
the
nation.
now,
that
particular
charge
was
said
in
a
federal
case
to
be
a
necessary
charge.
thus,
the
first
department
has
held
and
this
was
said
to
be
the
necessary
standard
in
the
manual
against
day
case
by
at
least
the
opinions
of
justices
stewart
and
harlan
--
with
justices
harlan
and
stewart.
now,
if
there
is
such
a
standard,
and
if
it
can
be
prove
and
it's
--
this
is
the
way
a
jury
must
judge,
surely
that
standard
can
be
proved
in
a
federal
case
as
well
as
in
a
state
case.
mr.
ephraim
london
that's
what
here
the
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
this
is
the
burden
that's
been
imposed.
mr.
ephraim
london
if
your
honor
please,
i
have
--
i
would
have
to
try
the
individual
case.
and
the
one
before
the
court
--
mr.
ephraim
london
my
--
my
burden
is
a
very
--
mr.
ephraim
london
that
can
certainly
opinion
evidence.
i
think
this
court
or
at
least
some
of
the
justices
of
this
court
have
indicated
have
indicated
in
session
--
mr.
ephraim
london
about
the
--
about
the
limits
of
community
tolerance.
about
what
is
acceptable,
about
the
kind
of
book
that
is
read,
about
the
kind
of
magazine
that
is
seen
on
the
--
on
the
stand.
mr.
ephraim
london
well,
as
your
honor
please,
you
are
speaking
more
of
the
burden
of
proof
of
the
standard
than
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
standard
is
provable.
whether
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
would
say
that
if
the
book
were
sold
freely
in
most
of
the
united
states
and
if
that
there
had
been
no
successful
prosecution
of
the
book,
in
most
of
the
united
states
that
this
book
did
not
offend
the
standards
of
the
people
of
the
united
states.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
this
is
in
your
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
logical
inference.
mr.
ephraim
london
again,
and
i
think
that
the
prosecution
should
show
to
sustain
his
burden
that
the
particular
book
does
not
only
offend
the
standards
in
the
local
community
but
the
people
elsewhere.
now,
i
--
i
concede
--
mr.
ephraim
london
that
--
that
maybe
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
but
they
are
comparable
pictures
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
london
very,
very
frequently,
you
would
have
i
think.
question
the
different
--
difference
of
opinion
amongst
experts.
mr.
ephraim
london
(inaudible)
mr.
ephraim
london
the
jury
--
the
jury
would
--
would
have
to
make
a
determination.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
--
i
suppose
somebody
who
knew
what
pictures
were
shown
or
what
books
were
sold
throughout
the
united
states
could
qualify
certainly
as
an
expert
on
what
is
--
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
somebody
who
knew
about
particular
pictures
and
knew
their
reception
throughout
the
united
states.
one
can
say
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
even
i
can
say
your
honor
that
this
particular
picture
when
i
look
at
it,
is
going
to
meet
with
difficulty
in
detroit
and
is
going
to
meet
with
--
with
difficulty
in
cleveland,
in
cleveland
heights.
but
in
the
rest
of
the
country,
it's
going
to
be
accepted
without
any
question.i
could
add
memphis
to
that
city.
now
i
think
that
the
--
i
--
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
i
--
i
may
say
that
i
am
called
upon
to
make
that
determination
from
time
to
time
and
i
do.
and
i
--
i
may
boast
of
some
accuracy
in
making
those
determination.
mr.
ephraim
london
this
is
--
this
is
my
understanding
of
the
roth
test
and
specifically
the
language
that
we
must
leave
the
door
only
the
slightest
fitted
jar.
certainly,
the
new
jersey
court
has
adopted
that
determination.
i
believe
that
wisconsin
supreme
court
has
--
has
adopted
that
as
being
the
proper
standard.
and
new
york
has
said
whether
or
not,
this
is
what
roth
meant.
this
is
our
standard
hardcore
pornography.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
there's
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
been
only
one
instance
of
the
case
where
there
is
a
question
is
debatable
as
to
whether
or
not
the
work
is
hardcore
pornography.
that
was
not
a
criminal
prosecution.
that
was
a
licensing
case.
mr.
ephraim
london
the
kingsley
case
as
i
remember
your
honor,
that
wasn't
even
an
issue
before
the
court.
the
--
the
owner
of
the
books
took
the
position
that
he
wanted
the
court
to
assume
that
they
were
pornographic
and
he
wanted
to
test
the
validity
of
the
law
so
that
the
court
never
had
to
pass
on
that
question
in
kingsley.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes.
and
that
was
by
the
way
before
the
hardcore
pornography
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
rule
was
established
in
the
state
of
new
york.
the
--
the
first
time
that
the
court
used
that
phrase
and
i
think
the
majority
was
willing
to
follow
it
was
in
the
richmond
county
case
which
was
later
than
the
kingsley
book
case.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
so.
but
i
think
that
these
difficulties
are
inherent
in
the
--
in
the
definition
of
obscenity.
and
i
suppose
that
it's
easier
to
determine
what
hardcore
pornography
is
than
just
ordinary
run
of
the
mill
pornography.
mr.
ephraim
london
no,
your
honor.
but
i
think
the
question
of
--
mr.
ephraim
london
by
--
by
definition,
i
--
i
have
assumed
that
hardcore
pornography
meant
something
that
was
so
shocking,
so
blatant
that
--
that
there
would
be
little
doubt
in
the
minds
of
reasonable
men.
mr.
ephraim
london
on
the
question
of
what
is
hardcore
pornography
and
as
i
think
justice
reed
once
suggested
in
various
opinions
of
--
stated
in
this
court
that
this
in
effect
is
what
the
court
has
been
doing
in
a
number
of
cases.
mr.
ephraim
london
oh
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
as
i
understand,
all
50
states
have
--
have
statutes.
mr.
ephraim
london
all
50
states
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
has
statutes
which
in
effect
say
that
if
a
man
sells
book
which
is
found
to
be
obscene
and
he
has
knowledge,
we
haven't
come
to
another
issue
of
just
exactly
what
intend
is
required
in
this
case.
but
if
he
certainly,
if
he
has
knowledge
of
the
--
of
the
contents
of
the
book,
i
understand
all
50
statute
--
all
50
states
has
statutes
which
would
punish
--
mr.
ephraim
london
subject
him
to
penitentiary
punishment
of
several
years.
mr.
ephraim
london
many
times.
mr.
ephraim
london
your
honor
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
think
he
would
--
he
would
unfortunately
be
compelled
to
take
the
risk.
the
risk
is
lessened
by
the
--
by
the
requirement
that
the
work
be
hardcore
pornography,
that
the
work
be
something
that
if
any
ordinary
man
would
reason
--
mr.
ephraim
london
your
honor,
i'm
--i'm
not
going
to
try
to
answer
that
question.
i
guess
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
--
mr.
ephraim
london
i
would
agree
with
your
view
point
but
i
have
no
hope
of
convincing
the
rest
of
the
court.
mr.
ephraim
london
your
honor,
i
have
meant
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
that
argument
and
they
cannot
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
dispute
it.
mr.
ephraim
london
that
is
why
i
indicated
i
didn't
hope
to
convince
the
court.
mr.
ephraim
london
but
i
--
i
do
agree
with
the
position
that
justice
black
has
taken.
mr.
ephraim
london
but
perhaps,
less
often
than
the
--
than
the
word
obscenity,
i
suppose
some
other
qualifying
word
would
make
it
--
mr.
ephraim
london
--
more
certain.
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
--
mr.
ephraim
london
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
the
court
ruling.
mr.
ephraim
london
i
would
hope
so,
but
i
would
--
i
would
state
also
that
the
--
that
the
various
state
courts
i'm
referring
myself
now,
have
indicated
that
some
further
guidelines
would
be
desirable
on
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
these
standards.
mr.
ephraim
london
thank
you.
