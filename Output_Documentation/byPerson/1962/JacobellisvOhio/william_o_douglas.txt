justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
a
pretty
good
one
in
that
case
though,
was
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
there
any
prosecution
for
that
--
showing
that
film?
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
many
prosecutions
of
this
kind
have
there
been
in
the
cleveland
area?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
i
gather
that
this
judgment
of
conviction
is
the
only
award
it
has
received
in
ohio.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
the
film
here
on
the
posit
of
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
the
only
--
is
the
only
part
of
the
film
challenged
or
seen
obscene?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
all
--
all
we
have
to
do
is
(inaudible)
that
131
feet?
