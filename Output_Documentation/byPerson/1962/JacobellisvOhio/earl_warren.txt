anything
to
do
with
it?
chief

who
was

for
that?
chief

mr.

the
trial
--
the
trial
court
refuse
to
consider
this
picture
as
a
whole?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
if
--
if
under
your
ohio
procedure,
three-judge
court
of
this
kind
is
required
to
make
findings
to
support
its
judgment.
chief

well
then,
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
know
what
standard
it
did

chief
justice
earl
warren
only
from
--
only
from
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
only
reading
the
entire
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
had
chosen
as
you
had
the
right
to
do
to
have
a
jury
you
could
have
had
instructions
on
that
subject
that
would
have
protected
your
right
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
could
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren

them
to
run?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mr.
--
mr.
corrigan.
chief
justice
earl
warren

that
case
may
i
ask,
mr.
corrigan
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
a
jury
case,
that
other
one
was
reversed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
not.
one
of
these
three-judge
courts
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
one
of
these
three-judge
courts
like
this
one
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
a
federal
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
i
see,

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
case
tried
to
a
court
or
to
a
jury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
have
had
a
jury
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
as
--
what
we're
dealing
now
with
the
opinion
in
roth
then
assuming
that
there
is
a
national
standard
or
should
be
a
national
standard,
what
do
you
conceive
that
standard
to
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you'd
have
to
give
instructions
to
a
jury
as
to
what
the
standard
was,
wouldn't
you
if
you
had
a
jury
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
right,
what
instruction
would
you
give
them
as
to
the
standard
of
obscenity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
london,
do
you
--
do
you
contend
that
--
nothing
but
the
hardcore
pornography
as
you
used
that
term
can
come
within
the
roth
test?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
burned
a
lot
of
books
with
porn
--
hardcore
pornography
at
new
york,
isn't
it?
in
the
kingsley
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
case
--
kingsley
book?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
but
--
but
the
lower
court
had
to
pass
on
it
in
order
to
do
what
it
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
you
think
mr.
london
that
we
would
eventually
have
as
much
difficulty
defining
what
is
hardcore
pornography
as
we
do
obscenity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
--
would
we
have
to
have
experts
from
all
over
the
country
determine
for
every
jury
what
constitutes
hardcore
pornography
and
what
doesn't?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
would
make
that
decision?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
mr.
corrigan.
