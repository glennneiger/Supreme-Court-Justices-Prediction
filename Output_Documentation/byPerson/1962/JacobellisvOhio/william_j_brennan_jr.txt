they
have
no
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
relates
to
what
issue
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
secondly,
the
requirement
of
that
--
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
[inaudible]
of
this
court
that
there's
--
it's
not
applied
to
national
or
international?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
was
--
was
--
was
there
an
express
ruling
of
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
was
just
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
just
asking
not
--
i
had
some
trouble
with
these
--
trying
to
find
out
how
this
was
an
issue
at
all
at
the
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
you've
got
to
have
evidence
--
you
have
evidence
on
that
part
that
you
say
each
county
--
this
was
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
that
there
are
some
of
these
evidences
of
the
area
outside
of
this
county
which
did
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you
--
you're
argument
was
--
i
believe
it's
on
this
record
assuming
it
should
have
been
a
national
census
that
on
that
record
there
was
no
basis
in
evidence
for
inclusion
that
on
that
community
standards.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
london,
if
you
are
right,
that
there
are
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
case
whether
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
a
full
version.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
matter
mr.
london,
i
gather
from
the
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
not
much
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
you
considered
this
--
that
it
provides
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said,
it
provides
the
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
i
gather
--
i
thought
you
were
arguing
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
only
find
the
dominant
theme
in
these
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
enough.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
london,
you
mean
the
only
part
that
was
the
--
the
deleted
part.
it's
the
only
thing
that
those
boards
would
require
the
deletion,
you
thought,
that
made
the
picture
obscene,
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
that
that
you
do
not
think
so
but
i
wondered
if
those
boards
have
required
the
release,
i
didn't
think
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that
favorable,
new
york
times
review,
was
that
of
the
--
of
the
--
that
was
just
exhibited
with
131
feet
out?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
it
become
the
practice
the
way
to
do
it
in
these
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
including
washington.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
supreme
court,
has
any
other
court
taken
as
to
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that's
what
we
intended
to
use
or
rather
unfortunately,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
even
--
even
the
other
one,
even
the
one
from
new
jersey
supreme
court
had
taken.
if
we
had
meant
national
standard,
isn't
community
an
unfortunate
way
to
express
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
london,
do
you
make
any
significance
in
the
fact
that
--
that
opinion
is
written
in
two
cases,
one
a
federal
case,
roth
and
the
other,
a
state
case,
alberts?
what
opinion
could've
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
london,
does
this
mean
that
every
state
and
every
federal
obscenity
prosecution
necessarily
fail
that
the
prosecution
doesn't
abuse
evidence
of
what
the
national
standard
is
that
--
that
may
affect
a
particular
book
or
a
motion
picture?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
the
answer
is
that
every
state
obscenity
prosecution
must
fail
that
the
prosecution
does
it
or
for
that
kind
of
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
may
--
but
you
don't
know
which
element
of
the
--
of
the
path
they've
laid
down
on
roth
may
have
determined
the
result
as
to
the
picture
of
--
a
picture
or
a
book.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
i
gather
if
we
agree
with
you
first
of
all,
that
even
under
the
roth
has
not
further
explicated,
this
was
not
obscene.
we
don't
reach
question
of
community
standard
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
london
sure
you
can't
just
stop
and
say
to
a
jury,
you
have
to
determine
this
according
to
a
national
standard.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
you'd
have
to
define
what
a
national
standard
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
what
--
well,
what
i
think
the
chief
justice
is
suggesting
and
i
certainly
like
it
to
have
some
help
with
it,
what
ingredients
would
you
put
in
this
national
standard?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
how
will
you
even
know
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you're
the
prosecutor
--
if
you're
the
prosecutor,
what
kind
of
evidence
are
you
going
to
give?unless
we
give
you
some
guidance
of
--
under
the
national
standard,
what
kind
of
evidence
satisfies?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
opinion
about
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
specific
(inaudible)
--
will
the
prosecution
have
to
come
in
and
say,
bring
in
a
whole
bunch
of
girly
magazines
and
say
now,
around
this
town
you
can
find
all
of
these
you
want,
at
the
barber
shops,
the
news
stands
and
everything
else,
but
that's
as
far
as
this
town
goes
in
acceptability
of
this
kind
of
fact?
is
that
what
you
have
to
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
suppose
in
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
in
your
very
case
mr.
london,
instead
of
being
the
--
the
last
experience
your
motion
picture
had
had,
that
which
resulted
in
your
prosecution,
that
has
been
the
very
first
--
had
never
been
exhibited
anywhere
else
in
united
states.
now,
what
in
that
circumstance
would
the
prosecution
had
to
prove
to
establish
it
was
obscene?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
nobody
has
ever
seen
the
picture.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
would
--
how
would
you
call
it
by
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
anybody
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
i
might
be
idle
on
that
to
decide
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
london
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
didn't
--
mr.
london
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
very
argument
was
made
in
the
roth
case
and
the
court
rejected
it.
the
court
found
that
there
wasn't
any
violation
in
these
criminal
statutes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
without
overruling
roth
in
that
respect.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
that
earlier.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understood
mr.
roth
that
many
states
are
now
revising
their
obscenity
law
to
proscribe
that
in
the
very
words
in
haec
verba,
the
roth
test
as
what's
violated
and
what
subjects
to
criminal
penalty,
is
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
roth,
we
doubt
of
the
very
question
whether
under
such
a
statute,
they
have
rule
against
(inaudible)
and
the
others
would
be
offended,
didn't
we?
and
we
held
it
would
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
this
is
only
a
fact
question
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
obscenity
is
only
question
of
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
that
--
if
that's
so,
then
i
gather
every
reviewing
court
is
free
to
arrive
with
a
different
constitutional
judgment
whether
this
picture
--
picture
is
obscene
or
not,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering
if
the
fact
that
three
ohio
courts
found
that
this
was
obscene
was
necessarily
at
all
controlling
on
whether
this
or
not
in
the
constitutional
sense
the
judgment
we
have
to
make.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
corrigan,
none
of
that
is
before
us
really,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
none
of
that
is
before
us
now
is
it?
in
this
case,
our
concern
is,
isn't
it,
whether
--
whether
as
mr.
london
has
suggested,
this
doesn't
raise
the
problem
rather
than
do
about
this
community
standards
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
hoping
you're
going
to
get
to
that
in
detail
about
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
do
you
meet
mr.
london's
argument
that
if
this
is
a
first
amendment
problem?
the
first
amendment
--
and
the
first
amendment
is
applied
to
the
states
as
it
would
be
applied
to
the
federal
government,
how
you're
going
to
escape
the
logic
of
his
argument
that
means
you
must
have
a
single
national
standard.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
just
to
say
that
you
think
there
ought
to
be
a
local
standard
that
that
answer
this
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
merely
to
say,
you
think
there
ought
to
be
a
local
standard
and
not
a
national
standard.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
would
you
prove
that
there's
a
community
standard?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
why
--
why
--
you
just
--
you
just
said
the
roth
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
just
said
you
thought
even
in
a
local
standard,
there
should
be
evidence?
why?
if
--
if
--
if
it's
a
local
standard,
isn't
the
jury
in
theory
at
least
and
perhaps
in
fact
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
--
better
judges
than
any
experts
brought
in
from
outside
just
to
what
the
local
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
record?
