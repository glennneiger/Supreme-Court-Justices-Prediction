what
is
on
screen,
an
apartment
house?
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
--
in
your
apartment
house
in
our
view
is
something
of
a
euphemism?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand.
i
was
just
curious.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
you
waive
a
jury
and
you're
not
entitled
as
of
right
to
three
judges
but
you're
entitled
to
the
discretion
of
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
--
except
for
the
capital
case?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
jacobellis
was
aware
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
a
time
of
the
--
when
he
got
possession
of
this
movie
and
exhibited
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
a
hollywood
writer
who
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
there
a
--
is
there
not
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
film
in
review
--
films
in
review.
justice
potter
stewart
after
all
the
expert
testimony
is
in,
it's
up
to
the
trier
of
the
facts
whether
the
trier
be
a
jury
or
a
judge
or
as
in
this
case
three
judges
to
make
its
own
determination,
isn't
that
true?
and
isn't
that
inevitably
going
to
be
the
local
standard,
certainly,
it
is
with
the
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
draw
it
in
the
cuyahoga
county
at
ohio.
you
don't
draw
jurors
from
the
florida
and
california
and
arkansas
and
maine
and
massachusetts.
you
draw
them
from
the
county.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
the
trial
--
in
the
trial,
it's
inevitably
going
to
be
the
standards
of
the
place
--
where
the
place
--
where
the
case
is
tried,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
we
are
bound
by
the
expert
testimony.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
can't
conceive
of
the
opposite
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
why
because
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes
but
it's
--
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
in
the
end,
it's
the
judgment
of
this
court,
the
members
of
this
court
or
rather
that
the
--
in
the
end,
the
members
of
this
court
are
bound
by
what
various
communities
have
done
or
failed
to
do?
justice
potter
stewart
that
stand
--
that
particular
factor
arose
not
from
movie
picture
case
but
in
the
case
of
books
and
literature
or
something.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
would
think
that
it
hasn't
been
held
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
do
you
think
that
this
is
the
use
of
extreme
case
that
if
you
had
an
hour
and
half
movie
of
rebecca
of
sunnybrook
farm
and
right
in
the
middle
of
the
film,
three
minutes
of
the
hardest
core
filthy
--
filthiest
pornography
that's
imaginable,
do
you
think
you
should
then
say,
“well,
98%
of
this
was
rebecca
of
sunnybrook
farm.”
justice
potter
stewart
but
judging
it
as
a
whole
is
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
dominate
as
a
whole
--
justice
potter
stewart
who
asked
to
waive
the
jury
in
this
case?
you
weren't
at
the
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
judge
--
federal
district
judge
campbell
in
chicago.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
first
thing
you
mentioned
is
this
very
case,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
wetzel
case
that
antedate
or
come
after
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
so
while
as
you
say,
the
ohio
is
now
clear.
it
wasn't
clear
at
the
time
of
the
trial
of
this
case,
was
it?
as
of
that
time,
the
rule
was
the
rule
of
the
state
against
mapp,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
state
against
mapp
held
that
mere
knowing
possession
of
obscene
material
was
a
criminal
offense
under
that
statue.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
if
somebody
just
found
something
in
the
street
and
picked
it
up
and
saw
it
was
obscene,
he
would
at
that
moment
be
guilty
of
an
offense
under
the
statute
as
construed
in
the
state
against
mapp,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
it
was
in
that
state
of
the
law
that
this
case
was
tried,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
the
conviction
on
--
this
was
the
conviction
on
both
counts,
wasn't
it,
on
possession
and
on
exhibition?
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
the
sentences
imposed
on
each
count?
justice
potter
stewart
seven
years?
justice
potter
stewart
or
seven
years
in
the
penitentiary
on
each
count?
justice
potter
stewart
this
movie
has
won
some
prizes
in
cannes
in
brazil.
do
you
think
those
prizes
were
given
purely
on
the
basis
of
this
three-minute
sequence?
justice
potter
stewart
this
movie
has
won
some
prizes
by
--
on
it's
--
based
on
its
artistic
merit.
do
you
think
those
prizes
were
awarded
purely
on
this
three-minute
objectionable
sequence?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
your
view
that
without
these
three
minutes
which
you
say
is
criminal
that
the
movie
would
be
entirely
without
value
for
--
of
any
kind.
justice
potter
stewart
for
artistic
otherwise.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
connotes
that
only
if
that's
an
element
of
the
crime
as
a
matter
of
state
law
and
state
against
mapp
had
held
that
it
was
not.
justice
potter
stewart
and
state
against
mapp
held
that
it
was
unlawful
even
without
that.
so
that
in
the
word
“unlawfully”
doesn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
word
“unlawful”
doesn't
add
or
attract
anything
because
that
merely
refers
you
to
the
law
whatever
it
may
be.
in
state
against
mapp,
it
said
that
guilty
not
--
guilty
purpose
was
not
a
necessary
ingredient
of
the
offense
as
a
matter
of
the
law.
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
you
mean
in
any
--
in
any
given
moment
in
any
given
time.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
a
criminal
prosecution
of
the
exhibitor,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
and
what
was
the
punishment?
justice
potter
stewart
and
no
--
no
sentence,
no
prison
--
no
imprisonment
was
imposed,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
how
--
how
you
find
out
the
national
standard?
is
it
the
lowest
common
denominator
or
is
it
some
average
of
all
the
public
opinion
in
each
of
the
50
states
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
the
determinable
(inaudible)
of
tolerance
in
this
particular
case.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
was
just
wondering.
i
--
i
presume
if
it's
a
national
standard,
you
--
you
couldn't
depend
upon
a
jury
which
always
is
drawn
from
a
very
local
community
as
from
a
county
to
make
a
determination
unless
it
was
hated
by
expert
testimony
or
testimony
of
tolerance
in
other
communities
through
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
--
it
couldn't
have
upon
a
local
jury
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
unaided
by
--
unaided
by
outside
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
i
suppose
the
jury
left
to
its
own
devices
would
apply
local
standards.
well
if
the
standards
of
it
--
of
the
community
from
which
its
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
--
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
depend
upon
a
local
judge
if
the
judge
were
the
trier
of
the
fact
without
evidence
as
to
the
tolerance
of
this
particular
book
or
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
potter
stewart
should
we
look
to
act
of
congress
to
determine
national
standard?
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
national
legislature
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
after
articulating
that
standard,
hasn't
new
york
gone
ahead
and
affirmed
convictions
of
for
items
which
are
not
hardcore
in
your
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
kingsley
books.
