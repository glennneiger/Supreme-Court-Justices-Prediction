mr.
john
t.
corrigan
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
may
i
address
my
remarks
in
part
to
the
reply
brief
filed
by
the
appellant
wherein
he
sets
forth
the
fact
that
in
the
appendix
12
of
my
brief,
that
therein
is
cited
a
case
which
has
been
reversed.
that
statement
is
correct.
that
case
has
been
reversed
on
appeal
and
reversed
for
the
reason
stated
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
appellant,
namely
that
the
procedure
employed
was
not
in
keeping
with
the
roth
case.
the
improper
standards
were
implied
--
employed
in
that
particular
instance.
i
wish
to
point
out
to
the
court
however,
that
while
i
take
the
responsibility
for
citing
that
case,
unfortunately,
the
two
assistants
that
have
--
that
in
this
case
up
until
this
time
are
no
longer
in
the
prosecuting
attorney's
office,
one
of
them
having
gone
on
to
the
assistant
district
attorney's
office
and
the
other
having
since
passed
away.
with
regard
to
the
other
appendix
to
which
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no,
apparently
that
was
a
one
man
court.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
was
in
the
federal
court,
campbell,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
with
respect
to
the
other
appendices
that
the
appellant
takes
objection
to
in
his
reply
brief,
may
i
point
out
that
these
appendices
where
before
this
court
previously
in
the
brief
supporting
the
motion
to
dismiss,
and
that
these
appendices
are
the
subject
of
testimony
of
the
several
witnesses
that
appear
in
the
transcript
of
the
record
that
is
before
the
court.
i
think
that
they
are
properly
before
the
court.
now,
with
regard
to
the
factual
situation
in
this
case;
the
case
in
the
first
instance
came
on
for
a
hearing
by
the
common
pleas
court
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
a
grand
jury
had
returned
an
indictment
after
viewing
the
movie.
under
the
ohio
law,
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury
or
a
waiver
of
the
same
or
in
the
discretion
of
the
court,
a
trial
by
a
three-man
court
if
application
was
made
for
such
a
trial.
in
this
instance,
an
application
was
made
for
a
trial
before
a
three-man
court
and
that
motion
was
granted.
the
trial
court
viewed
the
movie
as
did
the
court
of
appeals,
as
did
the
supreme
court
ultimately
in
passing
judgment
on
the
question
of
obscenity.
under
the
ohio
law,
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
court,
in
rendering
its
verdict,
set
forth
an
opinion
or
a
conclusion
of
law
or
a
fact.
however,
in
this
instance,
the
trial
court
did
set
forth
an
opinion
which
opinion
almost
in
toto
was
reiterated
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
supreme
court.
in
that
opinion,
the
court
will
note
that
the
trial
court
was
cognizant
of
and
did
employ
the
standards
set
forth
in
the
roth
case.
now,
with
respect
to
the
movie
itself;
it
was
not
contended
by
the
state
nor
is
it
contended
here
that
we
object
to
one
portion
of
the
movie
but
rather
that
we
object
to
the
movie
in
its
entirety.
and
as
the
court
did
employ
the
standard
set
forth
in
the
roth
case,
we
ask
that
the
standards
be
set
forth
in
the
review
in
this
particular
instance.
in
the
movie,
as
the
expert
witnesses
had
testified,
the
fourth
version
--
portion
of
the
movie
was
devoted
to
setting
the
stage
as
it
were
for
the
climax.
and
the
climax
was
one
wherein
a
young
married
woman,
mother
of
a
child
for
some
reason
or
another,
unhappy
with
her
husband's
failing
to
manifest
any
affection
or
attention
toward
her,
she
picked
up
with
a
relative
stranger
and
after
a
brief
dinner
engagement
in
their
home
in
this
particular
evening,
and
after
she
had
retired
for
the
evening,
she
went
out
into
a
garden
on
the
front
of
the
house
dressed
in
a
negligee,
met
this
young
man
and
they
then
proceeded
to
go
for
a
ride
in
a
boat
in
a
lake
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
house.
and
in
the
boat,
there
was
much
arduous
lovemaking
after
which
the
two
returned
to
the
house.
she
returned
to
the
upper
portion
of
the
house,
she
kissed
her
young
daughter
good
night
for
the
evening
and
then
returned
to
her
bedroom.
and
the
scene
then
shows
the
negligee
being
removed
from
the
upper
portion
of
her
body
and
dropping
to
the
floor.
and
then
she
in
turn,
removing
the
clothing
of
the
young
gentleman
and
these
being
dropped
to
the
floor.
the
scene
then
moves
to
the
bedroom
wherein
the
upper
portion
of
her
body
is
exposed
as
is
his
and
the
scene
depicts
him
laying
on
top
of
this
young
lady
engaged
in
arduous
embrace.
and
after
a
period
of
this
lovemaking,
he
then
disappears
and
she
is
seen
on
the
screen
and
as
the
expert
witnesses
testified,
experiencing
an
orgasm
and
leaving
no
other
inference
but
that
the
young
man
is
then
engaged
in
cunnilinguis.
after
this
is
completed,
the
young
couple
continued
to
spend
the
balance
of
the
night
sleeping
together
in
the
bed.
in
the
morning,
she
leaves
the
bed
and
retires
to
the
bathroom
for
the
purpose
of
taking
a
bath
and
she
is
in
the
bathtub
leaving
no
other
imprints
but
that
she
is
variably
nude
and
then
the
young
gentlemen
proceeds
to
get
in
the
bathtub
with
her
and
they
bathe
together.
then
the
movie
quickly
winds
up
with
the
two
of
them
dressing,
and
before
that
i
might
add,
he
wears
a
gown
and
at
which
time
he
opens
the
gown
and
invites
her
to
come
inside
the
gown
with
him
and
there
they
engage
in
an
embrace.
subsequently,
they
dress
and
they
are
on
their
way
leaving
all
behind.
your
honors,
in
this
case,
the
contention
is
made
that
2905.34,
as
interpreted
when
the
appellant
was
tried,
violates
the
constitutional
guarantees
of
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
defense
argues
that
the
mapp
case
which
was
before
this
court,
i
might
add
that
the
mapp
case
being
before
this
court
was
reversed
for
other
reasons
that
of
violating
due
process
because
of
an
unlawful,
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
but
then
in
the
mapp
case
before
the
state
of
ohio,
the
court
held
that
scienter
was
necessary
and
the
defense
contends
that
in
that
case,
that
culpable
intent
or
mens
rea
was
not
required.
i
argue
that
the
mapp
case
is
distinguished
from
the
present
case
and
that
in
the
mapp
case
we
were
concerned
with
mere
knowing
possession.
and
i
might
point
out
that
in
that
case,
that
case
did
not
preclude
the
application
of
the
ohio
statute
to
an
instance
or
into
a
fact
situation
wherein
there
is
a
possession
for
commercial
purposes,
a
possession
for
exhibition
as
is
the
case
in
this
instance.
just
--
judge
herbert
in
that
case
pointed
out
specifically
in
his
dissent
that
he
would
not
have
any
court
or
whatever
for
the
defendant
if
there
was
evidence
of
commercialization
in
that
instance.
in
the
instant
case,
we
find
that
the
defendant
had
no
inquisition.
we
find
that
he
had
exhibited
the
movie
to
critics.
this
by
admission
in
the
record
that
there
had
been
three
showings
before
the
film
was
confiscated
and
the
arrest
was
effective.
further,
the
evidence
showed
that
he
had
the
benefit
of
reading
the
reviews
local
and
otherwise
that
had
pointed
out
at
least
with
respect
to
the
local
reviews
that
are
in
the
opinion
of
those
reviewers,
this
movie
was
obscene.
state
versus
mapp
did
not
foreclose
the
ban
and
possession
for
purposes
of
exhibition.
mere
possession
as
possibly
was
the
case
in
the
mapp
case,
mere
knowing
possession
might
well
be
lawful.
certainly,
it
is
not
the
intent
of
the
law
to
hold
unlawful
the
possession
knowingly
of
obscene
material
by
a
prosecutor,
a
judge
or
a
jury
or
a
psychiatrist
holding
the
same
pretty
lawful
purpose
namely
to
affect
the
prosecution
there
under.
in
the
alberts
versus
california,
this
court
held
that
a
state
statute
was
constitutional
for
lewdly
keeping
for
sale
obscene
materials,
so
i
submit
that
much
more
so,
the
constitutionality
of
the
ohio
statute
should
be
upheld
for
it
knowingly,
or
prohibits
rather
the
knowing
possession
and
control
for
exhibition
of
an
obscene
motion
picture
film.
i
submit
that
a
conviction
there
under
for
knowingly
possessing
and
controlling
the
obscenity,
for
the
purpose
of
exhibition
and
the
actual
exhibition
is
and
should
be
a
sustainable
statute.
the
prevailing
and
authorative
interpretation
of
the
ohio
statute
is
to
be
found
in
state
versus
jacobellis
and
state
versus
wetzel,
173
ohio
state
and
then
in
these
two
cases,
the
facts
are
specifically
in
point
whereas
in
the
mapp
case,
the
mapp
is
generally
in
point.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that's
right.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
the
wetzel
case
was
tried
and
heard
on
the
same
day
in
the
ohio
state
supreme
court,
your
honor
and
in
the
wetzel
case,
a
conviction
was
had
in
the
trial
level.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
then
the
supreme
court
considered
the
wetzel
case
along
with
the
jacobellis
case
and
affirmed
the
conviction
of
the
common
pleas
court.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
the
state
against
mapp.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
not
in
the
facts
of
the
state
of
--
the
ruling
in
the
state
against
mapp
did
not
preclude
a
different
interpretation
with
different
facts
namely
facts
that
embodied
the
possession
for
commercial
purposes.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes,
your
honor,
however
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
however,
may
i
point
out
this,
that
in
the
mapp
case,
there
were
five
judges
that
found
the
constitution
or
found
the
statute
as
so
construed
to
be
unconstitutional,
nevertheless,
under
the
ohio
law,
it
is
necessary
that
six
out
of
the
seven
must
find
the
law
to
be
unconstitutional
when
the
appeal
is
taken
from
the
lower
court
in
order
to
affect
that
unconstitutional
finding.
but
i
submit
your
honor
that
in
the
mapp
case,
there
was
the
mere
knowing
possession
as
opposed
to
the
possession
for
commercialization
or
purposes
of
exhibition.
the
appellant
argues
that
the
state
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes
the
one
--
in
the
first
count,
i
believe,
the
sentence
was
$500.
this
statute
provides
for
an
imprisonment
or
a
money
fine
or
both.
i
believe
on
the
first
count,
the
fine
was
$500.
on
the
second
count
it
was
$1,500,
the
maximum
being
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
$2000
on
each
count.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
one
to
seven
years,
indeterminate
sentences,
your
honor.
the
court
is
not
empowered
to
--
of
sentence
specifically
the
number
of
years.
might
i
point
out
in
that
connection
also
and
this
is
raised
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief
that
there
is
one
offense
in
two
sentences.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
these
are
separate
and
distinct
offenses
much
the
same
as
the
offense
of
involving
narcotics
for
example,
the
possession
for
sale
and
the
sale.
they
are
separately
indictable,
they
are
separately
triable
and
one
is
not
a
--
trial
of
one
is
not
a
bar
to
the
trial
of
another.
i
might
point
out
that
this
contention
is
raised
by
the
amicus
curiae
and
i
think
that
is
a
proper
--
improper
contention.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes,
your
honor.
the
dominant
theme
as
taken
as
a
whole
is
obscene
and
without
the
last
portion
of
the
same,
the
fore
portion
becomes
meaningless.
it
becomes
dribbled
as
is
pointed
out
in
the
testimony
by
the
several
witnesses
put
on
by
the
state.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
then
i
submit,
your
honor,
you
would
have
nothing.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
it
would
be
perfectly
all
right
if
you
were
to
take
out
that
scene.
it
would
have
nothing
that
would
be
appealing
to
anyone.
for
the
meaningless
picture,
it
would
have
no
purpose
and
it
would
have
no
commercial
purpose
thereafter.
there
would
be
nothing
to
appeal
to
the
viewing
public.
it
would
be
a
movie
if
you
please
that
would
lead
you
to
a
certain
point
and
it
will
just
leave
you
hanging
high
and
dry.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
cannot
pass
judgment
as
to
why
the
prizes
were
awarded,
what
standards
were
used,
i
have
no
knowledge
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
for
any
purpose.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
the
three
minutes
is
dependent
upon
that
which
comes
before
and
that
which
comes
before
and
certainly
is
dependent
upon
the
--
the
climax
that
is
reached
in
the
last
portion
of
the
movie.
three
or
four
minutes,
i
don't
know
specifically
time
wise,
just
how
much
time
there
is.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
it
adds
to
it.
it
is
part
of
it.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
which
happens,
your
honor
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
oh
no.
no,
no.
oh
no,
the
dominant
theme
begins
at
the
very
beginning
when
the
characters
were
identified
and
when
their
relationship
one
to
another
as
made
known.
and
when
the
scenes
that
follow
that
which
set
the
stage
for
what
comes
ultimately,
this
are
part
of
the
dominant
theme.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
would
i
permit
it?
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
to
my
knowledge,
it
was
not
shown
in
the
greater
cleveland
area.
there
is
no
law
that
would
prohibit
it
being
shown
other
than
a
post-criminal
action
if
a
finding
was
made
by
a
grand
jury
that
the
same
was
indictable.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
to
my
knowledge,
it
was
not
shown
on
the
greater
cleveland
area,
your
honor.
it
may
well
have
been,
however.
there
was
no
prosecution
in
any
event.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
of
this
kind,
specifically,
i
would
say
that
we've
had
one
other
involving
a
movie.
this
was
appealed
to
the
ohio
state
supreme
court
and
not
beyond
that,
maybe
that
case
is
state
versus
juvera,
the
constitutionality
of
this
section
was
upheld
in
that
instance.
and
these
are
the
only
two
cases
to
my
knowledge
wherein
a
motion
picture
film
has
been
the
subject
of
the
prosecution
in
the
greater
cleveland
area.
now,
this
same
film,
your
honor,
was
the
subject
of
a
prosecution
in
dayton,
ohio,
predicated
on
a
misdemeanor
statute
and
a
conviction
was
had,
a
finding
was
made
by
a
jury
that
it
was
obscene.
however,
on
appeal,
the
supreme
court
reversed
that
decision
and
the
basis
of
the
smith
case
namely
that
that
misdemeanor
section
did
not
provide
scienter
and
therefore
reversed
it.
however,
there
was
the
conviction
in
fact
by
jury
on
the
same
movie.
in
that
same
connection,
the
appellant
contends
that
this
movie
has
been
shown
in
a
number
of
jurisdictions.
in
the
record,
we
have
evidence
of
the
fact
that
it
was
not
the
same
movie
in
new
york,
not
the
same
movie
in
boston.
the
movie
was
precluded
from
being
shown
in
virginia
and
in
maryland
until
it
was
presented
to
a
board
and
i
do
not
know
what
the
fact
is
with
respect
to
it
being
shown
in
a
hundred
other
jurisdictions.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
right
your
honor,
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
this
wasn't
a
film
given
a
commercial
name,
as
i
recall.
it
was
a
series
of
pictures
that
were
in
a
nickelodeon
type
picture
machine
and
my
recollection
is
that
by
putting
in
a
quarter,
you
receive
three
minutes
and
another
quarter
three
more
minutes
and
so
on.
and
it
was
that
entire
series
that
they
became
the
subject
to
that
litigation.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
not
a
commercial
movie
as
such.
the
appellant
in
connection
with
the
question
of
mens
rea
or
guilty
mind,
or
guilty
purpose
cites
and
supports
thereof
screws
versus
the
united
states.
and
he
contends
that
in
that
instance,
the
supreme
court
in
adding
the
word
“willful”
that
they
had
then
gave
meaning
to
what
was
a
vague
statute.
and
the
defendant,
because
of
being
prosecuted
on
a
vague
statute,
was
denied
due
process.
the
facts
of
that
case
are
these;
that
that
statute
in
substance
made
a
decline
for
one
under
the
color
of
office
or
authority
to
willfully
deny
another
his
right
of
due
process.
the
statute
specifically
provided
for
the
element
of
willfulness.
the
court
in
that
case
did
not
instruct
the
jury
on
the
element
of
willfulness
and
on
that
basis
alone,
certainly,
the
--
the
decision
should
have
been
reversed
for
due
process
was
denied
the
defendant.
the
court,
however,
did
point
out
that
the
term
“willful”
in
that
statute
gave
the
statute
more
meaning,
it
made
it
more
definitive.
so
also,
i
contend
that
in
the
ohio
statute,
when
we
have
the
word
“knowingly”
and
then
when
the
court
further
requires
as
an
inescapable
part
of
the
scienter,
the
element
of
mens
rea,
then
i
say
that
we
have
made
the
ohio
statute
as
definite
as
can
be
made
in
the
attack
that
the
same
as
vague
should
be
dismissed.
i
might
point
out
that
the
contention
is
made
that
the
trial
court
did
not
have
in
mind
at
the
time
that
it
rendered
its
decision,
the
element
of
mens
rea.
in
the
decision
of
the
trial
court,
you
will
find
that
the
court
found
that
the
acts
of
the
defendant
unlawfully
and
knowingly
possessing
for
purposes
of
exhibition
a
motion
picture
film.
the
term
“unlawfully”
certainly
connotes
the
element
of
guilty
mind
or
guilty
person
in
the
mind
of
the
trier
of
the
fact
when
they
use
that
term.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
it
is
not
spelled
out
in
the
statute.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
as
applied
to
the
facts
into
the
mapp
case,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
the
defendant
relies
further
in
this
area
on
the
case
of
james
versus
the
united
states.
in
james
versus
the
united
states,
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
failing
to
report
as
taxable
income
funds
which
were
embezzled.
and
the
defendant
presumably
was
relying
on
a
prior
decision
of
this
court
entitled
--
in
commission
versus
wilcox
where
this
court
specifically
held
that
embezzled
funds
were
not
taxable
income.
in
as
much
as
this
was
the
law
at
that
particular
time,
the
defendant
if
i
may
use
the
term
“sandbag”
into
believing
that
this
was
the
law
and
therefore
did
not
report
this
income.
and
this
court
held
that
he
could
not
be
charged
with
willfulness
because
of
the
fact
that
he
was
relying
on
that
which
was
then
the
announced
law
of
this
court
and
of
this
land.
i
think
that
this
case
is
distinguished
from
the
case
at
bar
and
that
i
contend
that
no
case,
no
court
as
well
as
the
mapp
case
said
that
mens
rea
or
guilty
purpose
or
guilty
mind
is
not
an
element
in
a
possession
for
the
purpose
of
exhibition
and
the
actual
exhibition
of
a
motion
picture
film.
i
contend
that
the
appellant's
possession
in
this
instance
was
not
in
their
private
possession.
and
in
order
to
make
effective,
the
prohibition
against
commercialization
against
selling,
against
giving,
against
lending,
against
exhibiting
as
is
provided
for
in
2905.34
and
since
the
instant
case
does
involve
the
possession
for
exhibiting,
then
in
determining
the
validity
of
the
statute,
it
should
be
determined
in
the
light
of
these
facts
and
not
some
mere
--
some
non-existent
mere
possession.
the
facts
here
are
that
the
defendant
held
private
showings
for
the
critics.
he
had
three
showings
before
the
arrest
was
affected,
he
placed
the
ads
in
the
newspapers,
he
had
counseled
with
the
police
officer
with
respect
to
the
propriety
of
showing
the
same
and
thereafter,
the
advertising
continued
and
he
again
showed
it
the
next
evening.
in
the
mapp
case,
we're
concerned
with
the
privacy
of
her
own
home
and
the
material
therein.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
it
was
another
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
they
found
that
there
was
mens
rea,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
they
said
that
it
was
inescapable
--
inescapably
a
portion
of
scienter.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
will
not
admit
to
the
fact
that
it
was
uncertain.
i
will
say
that
they
saw
the
mapp
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no,
i
won't
subscribe
to
that,
your
honor.
they
have
the
facts
of
the
mapp
case
and
the
interpretation
under
those
facts
and
how
we've
got
different
facts
and
interpreting
under
different
facts.
they
did
not
exclude
mens
rea.
and
in
the
mapp
case,
i
might
point
out
that
justice
herbert
specifically
said
that
i
would
have
no
quarter
or
whatever
for
the
defendant
if
there
was
evidence
that
this
was
a
commercialization
or
a
possession
for
commercial
purposes.
in
point
two,
the
appellant
argues
and
i
must
quickly
move
through
this
one
that
the
statute
should
be
void
in
its
entirety.
for
the
first
time,
now,
we
have
the
entire
statute
being
the
subject
of
concern.
i
submit
that
this
was
not
properly
raised
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
it
was
not
before
the
lower
courts,
and
in
general,
may
i
say
that
the
rule
of
law
that
the
court
--
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
should
not
be
tested
and
the
abstract
should
be
employed
in
this
particular
instance.
only
the
legal
rights
of
the
litigant
should
be
adjudicated.
however,
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution,
i'll
point
up
that
the
appellant
contends
that
in
this
case
there
are
exceptions
that
are
applicable.
he
points
out
for
example
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
in
a
majority
of
its
intended
applications.
he
then
speculates
and
engages
in
conjecture
and
says
that
the
statute
has
already
been
declared
unconstitutional
in
the
vast
majority
of
its
intended
application.
this
statute,
i
submit,
has
not
been
found
unconstitutional
in
any
application.
he
goes
down
to
say
that
where
the
statute
would
have
an
inhibitory
effect
on
expression
that
then
the
court
should
look
into
the
statute
in
its
entirety.
and
he
cites
to
support
this
position,
the
smith
case,
the
smith
case
is
distinguished
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
lacks
scienter.
we
have
scienter
in
this
instance.
he
cites
the
thornhill
case,
this
case
is
distinguished
because
the
framing
in
that
instance
against
the
defendant
was
generally
and
not
specifically.
in
conclusion,
may
i
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
in
light
of
the
facts
in
this
case?
thank
you.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
it
is
well
to
begin
with
giving
the
court
a
bit
of
a
background
with
regard
to
how
this
case
is
here
before
the
court.
an
arrest
was
made
after
a
showing
of
a
film
entitled
“the
lovers”
in
cleveland
heights
a
suburb
of
the
city
of
cleveland.
after
this
arrest
was
made,
the
film
in
question
was
submitted
to
a
grand
jury
and
the
grand
jury
returned
an
indictment
charging
the
defendant
with
two
violations
of
the
law.
that
of
possessing
with
knowledge
and
i've
seen
motion
picture
film
and
a
certain
count
of
exhibiting
knowingly
and
i've
seen
motion
picture
film.
the
defendant
was
entitled
under
the
law
to
a
trial
by
jury
but
elected
to
move
the
court
to
have
a
three-man
court
try
the
case
and
under
the
ohio
law,
this
is
discretionary
with
the
court
and
the
court
granted
the
motion
and
permitted
the
trial
by
a
three-man
court.
the
three-man
court
in
its
memorandum
opinion
which
is
set
forth
in
the
brief
of
the
appellee
recites
the
rule
of
the
roth
case
as
the
basis
for
its
finding.
the
case
subsequently
was
appealed
to
a
three-man
appellate
court.
and
the
appellate
court
again
cites
the
rule
of
the
roth
case
as
its
basis
for
affirmation.
the
case
was
then
appealed
to
the
ohio
state
supreme
court
and
the
ohio
state
supreme
court
again
affirmed
six-to-one
citing
the
rule
of
the
roth
case
as
its
affirmation.
now,
going
immediately
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
rule
is
or
should
be
hardcore
pornography.
the
law
of
ohio
and
the
law
of
the
50
states
and
the
law
of
the
united
states
in
dealing
with
the
obscenity
as
i
understand,
have
used
the
term
obscenity
and
not
the
term
hardcore
porno
--
pornography
nor
have
the
decisions
of
any
state
or
the
decision
of
this
united
states
supreme
court
at
any
times
that
the
rule
is
with
respect
to
hardcore
pornography.
let
us
assume
however
for
a
moment
that
that
was
so.
pornography
as
i
recall
has
its
derivation
at
a
greek
word
which
means,
dealing
with
prostitution.
so,
pornography
is
now
all
inclusive
in
the
term
obscenity
because
much
obscenity
deals
with
matters
other
than
that
which
deals
with
prostitution.
however,
in
the
instant
case,
justice
radcliffe
of
the
ohio
state
supreme
court
in
his
majority
opinion
stated
that
this
was
worst
than
hardcore
pornography.
so,
in
order
to
be
worst
than
hardcore
pornography,
he
undoubtedly
found
that
to
be
such.
i
know
of
no
rule
of
law
that
is
reiterated
more
often
in
the
reviewing
courts
than
the
rule
that
a
reviewing
court
will
not
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
finders
of
the
fact
where
there
is
evidence
to
support
that
finding.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no.
i
think
obscenity
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
facts
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
it
is
one
of
those
difficult
questions
your
honor
because
of
the
legal
definition
of
obscenity
that
it
obviously
must
become
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no.
i
do
not
say
that
it
forecloses
that
your
honor.
now,
the
statement
was
made
by
the
appellant
that
this
motion
picture
film
has
been
reviewed
by
a
number
of
reviewing
boards
and
has
had
no
difficulty.
i
ask
you
if
you
will
to
go
to
the
record
page
376
and
in
the
testimony
given
by
mr.
frankel,
the
president
of
the
distributor
of
this
film.
the
question
that
was
asked
to
him
was
--
that
shown
at
the
top
of
the
page,
was
that
shown
to
the
censor
board
in
chicago,
illinois.
the
answer
yes
sir.
was
it
censored
by
the
law
and
the
state
of
new
york?
isn't
that
correct?
the
answer
was
yes.
now,
the
same
film
that
was
shown
in
cleveland
heights
is
not
shown
to
the
public
in
the
state
of
new
york
in
its
entirety.
in
its
entirety,
no.
and
i'm
moving
further
down
the
page.
so
far
as
you
know,
there
are
two
prints
of
this
film,
generally
speaking,
two
different
versions.
his
answer
to
that
is,
yes
sir.
now,
the
one
shown
in
dayton,
ohio,
that
was
the
same
as
the
one
shown
in
the
cleveland
heights
theater?
yes
sir.
this
film
--
and
no
version
is
being
shown
in
the
state
of
maryland?
have
attempts
been
shown
--
have
been
made
by
zenith
international
to
show
the
film
in
maryland?
an
attempt
was
made
by
zenith
international
and
i
was
present
to
secure
a
censor
seal
from
the
state
of
maryland.
well,
the
state
of
maryland
requested
several
deletions,
isn't
that
right?
yes.
there
were
two
deletions
requested.
moving
down
the
page
in
the
film
"the
lovers"
isn't
shown
in
any
version
in
the
state
of
maryland?
answer:
no.
this
film
is
not
shown
on
any
version
in
the
state
of
virginia?
answer:
no,
sir.
so
i
submit
that
this
film
has
had
difficulty
in
other
areas.
now,
with
regard
to
dayton
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no,
you
do
not.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
the
only
version
here
is
the
ver
--
is
the
film
that
was
shown
in
cleveland
heights
and
the
film
that
was
shown
in
dayton,
ohio.
now,
in
dayton,
ohio,
this
film
was
shown
to
a
jury
and
the
jury
made
a
finding
of
guilty.
however,
the
charge
there
was
predicated
under
a
misdemeanor
statute
of
the
--
of
ohio.
this
did
not
require
scienter
as
did
the
felony
statute.
an
appeal
was
taken
from
the
dayton
case,
an
affirmation
was
had
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
when
it
got
to
the
supreme
court,
the
supreme
court
found
the
misdemeanor
statute
unconstitutional
because
of
the
lack
of
the
scienter
provision
in
keeping
with
the
smith
case
of
this
united
states
supreme
court.
now,
the
appellant
argues
that
as
interpreted,
this
statute
was
violative
of
the
constitutional
guarantees
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
as
part
of
his
argument,
he
cites
the
mapp
case.
the
mapp
case
was
a
case
wherein
the
question
of
possession
of
obscenity
was
an
issue
and
miss
mapp
was
found
guilty
and
upon
appeal
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
for
another
reason
involving
search
and
seizure,
a
reversal
was
held.
this
court
did
not
pass
upon
the
question
of
obscenity
in
the
mapp
case.
however,
the
facts
of
the
mapp
case
were
such
that
they
concerned
--
were
concerned
with
mere
possession
as
opposed
to
possession
for
commercial
purposes.
the
appellant
contends
that
in
the
mapp
case,
there
was
a
lack
of
guilty
purpose
or
mens
rea
announced
by
the
court
as
an
element
of
the
obscenity
law
of
ohio.
the
mapp
case
did
not
say
that
guilty
purpose
was
not
a
necessary
element.
the
mapp
case
merely
concerned
itself
with
a
factual
situation
of
a
mere
possession
knowledgeable
but
not
a
possession
for
commercial
purposes
or
for
--
with
a
guilty
purpose.
in
the
instant
case,
we
are
concerned
with
a
knowing
possession
for
the
purposes
of
public
exhibition.
state
versus
mapp
did
not
foreclose
the
ban
on
possession
for
purposes
of
exhibition.
again,
for
purposes
of
clarification
may
i
say
that
four
out
of
the
six
charges
in
the
mapp
case
found
that
as
applied
to
the
mapp
--
mapp
facts,
the
statute
to
be
unconstitutional.
though,
four
out
of
the
six
so
found
that
this
is
not
sufficient
in
ohio
to
make
a
law
unconstitutional,
the
reason
being
that
it
is
necessary
in
an
appeal
from
a
lower
tribunal
that
all
but
one
of
the
justices
must
find
it
to
be
unconstitutional
in
order
to
make
a
statute
unconstitutional.
in
alberts
versus
california
passed
upon
by
this
court,
this
court
found
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute
which
provided
for
the
lewdly
keeping
or
sale
of
obscene
materials.
much
more
so,
the
constitution
of
--
constitutionality
of
the
ohio
statute
should
be
upheld
for
prohibiting
the
knowing
possession,
the
control
and
the
knowing
exhibition
of
obscene
motion
picture
films.
mapp
is
generally
in
point
only
and
that
it
deals
with
the
question
of
this
statute
whereas
state
versus
jacobellis
which
is
the
state
case
of
this
case
before
this
court
now
and
state
versus
wetzel,
w-e-t-z-e-l
which
was
decided
at
the
same
time
is
specifically
in
point
and
this
clearly
gives
the
interpretation
of
the
ohio
state
supreme
court
relative
to
the
construction
of
the
ohio
statute.
there
can
be
little
doubt
but
that
in
the
mapp
case
when
justice
stewart
said
and
justice
--
justice
stewart
said
in
mapp,
"i
would
however
reverse
the
judgment
in
this
case
because
i
am
persuaded
that
the
provisions
of
2905.34
of
the
ohio
revised
code
upon
which
the
petitioner's
conviction
was
based
is
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
harlan
not
consistent
with
the
rights
of
free
thought
and
expression
assured
against
state
action
by
the
fourteenth
amendment."
in
this
instance,
the
justice
had
in
mind
a
mere
possession
as
opposed
to
a
knowing
possession
for
purposes
of
exhibition.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
beg
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
this
your
honor
--
this
mens
rea
is
an
issue
that
was
raised
in
the
first
point
of
the
appellant.
he
unfortunately
did
not
get
to
that
in
arguing
it
to
the
court.
it
is
argued
in
the
--
in
the
brief.
now,
he
argues
also
with
regard
to
community
standards
and
i
say
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
say
that
the
community
standards
set
forth
in
the
roth
case
are
the
standards
that
were
filed
--
were
followed
and
the
standards
that
should
be
followed.
why,
pray
tell,
should
ohio
be
compelled
by
the
standards
of
somebody
far
distant
from
ohio.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
think
your
honor,
we
have
to
apply
rule
of
reason
and
a
rule
of
reason
on
this
instance
it
seems
to
me
places
the
responsibility
upon
a
jury
certainly
in
making
a
finding
with
respect
to
what
is
the
standards
of
that
particular
community
and
has
this
material
below
that
standards
and
if
so
then,
is
it
obscene?
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i'm
sorry
your
honor
i
didn't
heard
you.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
that
you
cannot
have
a
national
standard.
you're
going
to
work
hodgepodge
on
this
area.
you're
going
to
destroy
the
whole
idea
of
having
any
laws
regulating
obscenity,
and
you're
going
to
make
impossible
the
establishment
of
the
standards
and
to
present
the
question
to
a
jury.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
you
prove
community
standards
your
honor
by
putting
them
in
evidence
people
who
are
able
to
answer
to
a
hypothetical
question
for
example
relative
to
the
material
in
question,
you're
able
to
have
these
people
testify
as
to
whether
or
not
this
material
is
below
or
above
the
community
standards,
you're
able
to
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
--
subject
them
to
cross-examination
as
to
the
basis
for
their
opinion.
you're
able
to
present
to
them
other
materials
in
the
same
area
that
they
will
pass
judgment
on
and
i
might
add
in
this
case
evidence
to
this
effect
was
put
on
by
the
defense
as
well
as
the
state
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
--
in
an
effort
to
show
the
community
standards.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
but
a
jury
does
and
can
take
judicial
notice
if
you
please,
if
i
may
use
that
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
--
terminology
with
respect
to
what
to
be
the
standards
are.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
you
have
to
make
--
you
have
to
make
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
your
honor,
you'd
have
to
make
a
record
upon
which
to
appeal.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
you've
got
to
have
something
before
the
appellate
court
otherwise
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
the
obscene
publication
in
this
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i'm
sorry.
i
can't
hear
you
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
don't
think
that
you'll
necessarily
have
it.
i
certainly
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
--
think
that
it
is
--
it
is
helpful
in
making
the
determination
as
to
what
the
community
standard
is.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
exactly
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
how
can
you
escape
the
ultimate
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
well,
i
don't
say
that
this
court
escapes
that
ultimate
responsibility.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
--
i
wouldn't
put
it
in
a
category
of
having
a
great
value,
no.
it
--
it
does
have
some
probative
value
as
to
the
degree
of
value,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
--
a
great
weight
to
be
given
to
that.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no
sir
i
would
not.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no.
i
--
i
do
not
agree
with
you
your
honor
that
you
would
make
it
finally
but
no
community
can
determine
its
own
standards.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
no,
i
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
--
i
don't
quite
agree
with
you.
i
--
i
think
that
you
would
have
to
make
a
finding
that
the
selection
of
the
jury
in
the
first
instance
was
proper.
i
think
that
you
would
--
i
think
that
you
would
have
to
make
a
determination
that
the
jury
knew
their
community
standards.
you
certainly
would
give
weight
to
whatever
evidence
there
was
other
than
that
that
would
aid
the
jury
in
being
exposed
to
the
community
standards
by
other
testimony.
then,
all
of
these
taken
as
a
whole
would
be
the
basis
upon
which
you
would
predicate
your
judgment
or
along
with
viewing
the
subject
matter
in
question
and
--
and
making
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
their
findings
were
consistent.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
you
could
make
that
finding,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
that
is
correct
sir.
i
--
i
agree
with
that
proposition.
the
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
in
ohio?
no.
i
have
no
idea
your
honor.
in
our
--
in
our
jurisdiction
perhaps,
the
whole
gamut
of
obscenity
in
the
course
of
the
year,
maybe
a
dozen
to
15
such
cases.
and
with
regard
to
motion
picture
films,
this
is
the
second
since
1957,
the
other
one
was
appealed
to
the
ohio
state
supreme
court
in
a
--
it
was
affirmed
in
that
court
that
appeal
was
not
taken
to
this
court
with
regard
to
other
type
of
material,
literature,
as
i
say,
maybe
as
many
as
a
dozen
a
year.
the
majority
--
the
vast
majority
dealing
with
pictures
and
magazines
depicting
sexual
activities
between
both
female
and
males
and
in
most
instances,
these
are
not
appealed
and
in
most
instances,
i
might
add
a
--
a
plea
of
guilty
as
the
result
rather
than
a
trial.
but
i
would
say
that
there
--
in
a
given
year
probably
or
not
in
excess
of
15
in
cuyahoga
county
which
has
a
population
of
approximately
1,700,000
people.
moving
on
to
the
second
point
of
the
appellant's
argument
and
i
submit
that
this
should
not
be
before
the
court
or
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
the
appellant
did
not
set
forth.
this
is
one
of
the
bases
of
his
appeals.
for
the
first
time,
he
submits
to
the
court
for
its
consideration
the
entire
statute
and
the
--
the
constitutionality
are
the
same.
when
i
submit
that
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
should
never
be
tested
in
the
abstract,
and
only
in
the
--
with
respect
to
the
legal
rights
of
litigants,
should
it
be
adjudged?
however,
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
this
point,
the
appellant
argues
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
the
majority
of
its
intended
applications.
and
then
he
speculates
and
he
engages
in
conjecture
and
as
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
that
the
court
will
not
go
beyond
the
limits
of
the
facts
in
litigation.
the
appellant
sets
up
three
exceptions.
the
first
being
with
the
statute
and
question
has
already
been
declared
unconstitutional
the
vast
majority
of
its
intended
applications.
this
is
not
so
here.
this
statute
has
not
been
found
to
be
unconstitutional
in
any
of
its
applications.
the
second
is,
where
the
statute
would
have
an
inhibiting
effect
on
expression.
for
this
exception,
the
appellant
relies
on
smith
versus
california
which
we
distinguished
because
that
lack
the
scienter
provision
which
is
in
the
ohio
law.
he
relies
also
on
the
thornhill
case.
this
we
say
is
distinguishable
because
the
finding
against
the
defendant
in
that
instance
was
in
the
general
language
of
the
statute
and
not
by
any
specification
of
the
evidence
or
any
specific
portion
of
the
statute.
he
further
cites
herndon
versus
lowry
to
support
this
position
and
i
contend
that
this
case
is
distinguished
because
here,
the
court
found
the
statute
to
be
vague,
so
vague
as
to
make
a
criminal
and
--
to
make
criminal
and
innocent
utterance.
the
third
contention
is
that
where
the
statute
is
left
standing,
it
would
not
give
fair
warning
of
its
prohibition.
here,
to
support
this
position,
the
appellant
in
my
opinion
dissects
the
statute
and
he
argues
for
example
that
the
statute
provides
where
a
material
is
not
wholly
obscene
but
contains
lewd
and
lascivious
articles
that
violates
the
roth
rule.
a
reading
of
that
statute
sets
forth
that
no
one
shall
knowingly
sell,
give,
lend
away
--
lend,
give
away
a
book,
picture
or
film
and
so
on
which
is
obscene.
and
then
it
goes
on
and
we
states
and
no
one
shall
give,
lend
away
--
lend,
give
away
a
book,
picture,
film
and
so
on
not
wholly
obscene
but
containing
lewd
and
lascivious
material
that
purpose
of
this
statute
is
that
we
conceivably
could
have
a
magazine
that
would
have
many
articles
in
it
and
one
of
those
articles
could
be
most
obscene
and
the
rest
of
the
magazine
be
devoted
to
wholesome
material.
under
the
ohio
statute,
an
individual
could
be
prosecuted
for
the
exhibiting,
selling
of
that
obscene
material.
i
do
not
think
that
the
roth
rule
is
a
rule
of
quantity
but
rather
a
rule
of
quality.
you
could
not
conceivably
have
a
book
that
would
be
a
hundred
pages
and
49
of
which
would
be
obscene
and
51
not
obscene
and
then
say
that
therefore,
this
book
could
not
be
found
obscene.
the
appellant
argues
also
that
this
section
in
part
provides
that
no
person
shall
--
shall
give
away
--
show
to
a
minor
an
obscene
lewd
or
lascivious
work.
and
in
support
of
this
--
this
contention
of
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
in
this
application,
he
cites
butler
versus
michigan.
butler
versus
michigan
was
a
case
wherein
you
will
recall
where
an
adult
was
prosecuted
for
the
possession
of
materials
that
would
tend
to
the
delinquency
of
a
minor.
the
ohio
statute
provides
that
an
adult
would
be
prosecuted
if
there
was
a
sale
to
a
minor
not
merely
the
possession
or
if
there
was
a
knowing
exhibition
of
the
material
to
a
minor
so
butler
isn't
--
not
at
all
in
point.
he
says
that
this
section
is
unconstitutional
because
it
contravenes
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution
and
that
it
accepts
from
its
application
works
of
art.
this
in
fact
is
not
so.
it
accepts
from
its
application
bona
fide
works
of
art.
bona
fide
works
of
art
are
defined
as
being
works
of
art
that
are
not
obscene.
it
provides
also
that
these
bona
fide
works
of
art
be
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
--
presentments
from
a
--
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
certainly
not
obscene
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
corrigan
it
would
be
a
bona
fide
work
of
art.
and
--
and
in
addition
to
that,
even
if
it
were
not,
it
is
not
obscene
on
any
sense
by
any
test
that
i
know.
and
with
respect
to
the
bona
fide
work
of
art
coming
from
an
association,
the
bona
fide
art
association
is
defined
as
one
in
the
law
as
an
organization
not
in
contravention
with
other
sections
of
the
law
that
deal
with
obscene
language,
nudism,
obscenity,
seduction,
sodomy,
wife
slavery,
adultery,
fornication
and
the
like.
so
a
bona
fide
association
is
one
that
has
proven
names
of
conformity
with
the
well
ordered
society.
and
i
submit
that
if
this
movie
was
published
by
an
art
association,
the
exhibition
of
the
film
would
still
be
subjected
to
the
criminal
law
and
therefore,
there
is
not
an
exception
on
the
law
which
would
be
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution.
he
contends
also
that
a
matter
having
second
class
mailing
privileges
is
exempted
from
the
application
of
the
law.
this,
we
contend
is
a
justified
classification
or
no
mail
--
no
obscenity
maybe
mailed
by
any
class
whatever
and
we
contend
that
this
is
a
proper
classification.
thank
you
your
honor.
