assumptions
sometimes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
practical
question?
you
tried
a
lot
of
these
cases?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
rather
come
before
a
jury
or
before
a
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
really?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
your
point.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
it
shown
in
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
supreme
court
construed
the
statute
in
relation
to
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
found
it
in
--
in
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
statute
required
them.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
trial
court
decides
--
at
the
time
it
decided
the
case,
the
three-judge
court
found
that
the
law
was
uncertain
at
least
at
that
time.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
to
do
some
synthetic
argument
though
to
say
the
law
was
clear,
but
frankly
it
was
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
of
course
the
court
has
never
announced
the
hardcore
porno
--
hardcore
pornography
test
even
in
a
federal
prosecution.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
some
of
it
do
have
but
the
court
has
not
adopted
that
here
so
far.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
only
commented
the
views
of
myself
and
my
brother
stewart.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
what
states
was
this
picture
been
banned?
justice
john
m.
harlan
been
shown
in
other
parts
of
ohio?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
one
we've
got,
the
131
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
saying,
i
take
it
is
that
the
--
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
gives
the
same
scope
in
this
area,
to
the
first
amendment,
as
the
first
amendment
itself
then
it
automatically
follows,
is
that
it?
that
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
it
has
to
be
a
--
a
national
one
or
not
a
community.
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
if
you
put
it
--
if
you
put
it
conversely,
a
community
standard
meaning
less
than
a
national
standards,
does
it
says
then
--
now,
would
it
also
follow
that
there
is
a
different
scope
(inaudible)
more
light
to
than
the
--
under
the
fourteenth
and
the
federal
government
than
the
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
community
standard
test,
whether
it's
national
or
--
or
less
than
national,
at
least
it
really
is
another
way
of
saying
that
whether
the
first
amendment
(inaudible)
to
the
fourteenth
has
the
same
scope
as
the
first
amendment
directly?
is
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
you
were
rewriting
the
roth
and
alberts
case,
how
would
you
formulate
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
it
can't
be
done,
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
have
we
got
both
versions
here,
the
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
have
we
got
both
versions
of
this
film
here
in
the
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
we
just
got
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
perhaps
every
jury
men
who
sits
on
these
cases
have
read
by
and
large
(inaudible)
i
suppose
what
you're
doing
with
this
evidence
is
to
expose
the
juryman
to
at
least
view
the
other
individual
in
the
community
in
the
name
of
community
standards
to
tell
him.
well,
you
ought
to
consider
this
before
you
say
this
book
is
obscene
or
--
or
to
consider
that
before
you
say
it
isn't
obscene.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
advisory
on
the
ultimately
--
ultimately
the
question
of
obscenity
whether
it's
a
federal
case
or
a
state
case
being,
you
say
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
the
law
of
being
constitutional
--
i
don't
--
how
can
you
escape
the
ultimate
proposition
that
what's
obscene
and
what
isn't
obscene
ultimately
if
what
this
court
says
is
--
it
isn't
so?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
can
you
escape
it?
if
--
how
can
this
--
how
can
you
suggest
that
this
court
can
escape
that
ultimate
responsibility?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore,
the
evidence
is
presented
to
a
jury
if
the
jury
finds
obscenity,
is
in
no
great
value
is
it
when
it
comes
up
to
this
court
to
review?
a
matter
that
this
court
happens
to
think
is
beyond
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
wouldn't
exclude
it
obviously?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
you
would
on
argument
of
counsel,
saying,
now
you
ought
to
take
a
look
at
this
passage.
justice
john
m.
harlan
maybe
a
little
off
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
point,
have
you
any
idea,
how
many
obscenity
prosecution
there
are
in
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
would
the
venus
de
milo
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
would
the
venus
de
milo
be
classified
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
would
the
venus
de
milo
be
classified
as
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
antiquity?
i'm
just
interested
in
that
provision,
how
does
it
work?
