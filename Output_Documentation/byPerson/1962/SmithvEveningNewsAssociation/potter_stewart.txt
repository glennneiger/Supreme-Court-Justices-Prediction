mr.
harris,
as
a
matter
of
local
law
could
the
guild
had
sued
as
an
uncooperative
association
as
a
party
to
the
guild
of
the
party
to
--
as
plaintiff?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
i
wondered
if
it
is
(inaudible)
would
require
that
form
of
action
which
is
required
that
as
of
a
--
maybe
by
the
michigan
law
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
take
it,
in
that
case,
it
would
have
been
much
wiser
if
you've
had
the
union
a
plaintiff.
justice
potter
stewart
apart
from
the
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
i
wasn't
suggesting
that,
i'm
just
asking
you
as
a
matter
of
procedure.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
in
dowd
box,
the
only
question
presented
was
whether
or
not
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
in
301
suits
was
exclusive.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
an
unfair
--
that
its
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
--
and
that
was
certainly
implicitly
dealt
with
here,
correct?
but
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
--
as
i
remember
it
with
these
--
what
substantive
law
was
applicable.
justice
potter
stewart
it
certainly
wasn't
that
he
assumed
in
the
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
or
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
true
in
lucas
flour,
that
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
might
have
forgotten
that.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
lucas
flour
that
said
that.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
entirely
again
based
on
the
statute,
isn't
it,
the
implications
of
the
railway
labor
act?
justice
potter
stewart
the
duty
to
fairly
represent
--
justice
potter
stewart
by
statute.
by
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
now
how
about
the
right
of
an
incorp
--
of
a
union,
an
incorporated
association
to
sue
as
a
party
plaintiff,
is
that
suit
in
there?
justice
potter
stewart
cannot.
justice
potter
stewart
as
an
assignee
and
therefore
they're
asserting
somebody
else's
rights,
yes?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
if
--
as
a
matter
of
state
procedural
law
even
in
a
case
which
was
concededly
based
on
the
union's
right
as
the
union
but
what
if
the
--
if
the
state
required,
it
wouldn't
--
would
not
permit
a
union
to
be
a
party
plaintiff
and
required
that
individual
employee
--
that
individuals
be
in
--
be
the
plaintiffs.
now,
and
certainly
that
would
be
under
301
or
could
be
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
it
was
too.
justice
potter
stewart
apparently
so,
that
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
talking
about
the
“uniquely
personal
right”?
justice
potter
stewart
and
now
are
these
nine
circuits
which
you
consider
this
--
so
they
considered
it
since
lincoln
mills?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
could
fall
into
the
same
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
within
the
footnote
on
page
21
of
your
brief,
most
of
them?
justice
potter
stewart
sometimes
that's
done
when
they
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
to
be
any
power
on
the
part
of
the
court,
state
or
federal
to
refer
to
the
board
for
the
way
courts
should
refer
to
the
icc
in
some
matters
within
that
agency's
expertise?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
whether
or
not
be
desirable,
do
you
think
there's
any
mechanics
available
either
on
the
part
of
the
court
referring
or
on
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
part
of
the
board
which
would
be
the
recipient?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
the
practical
difficulty
with
your
suggestion
is
that
almost
invariably
the
short
statute
of
limitations
would
have
run.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
this
would
leave
in
that
case,
that
case
