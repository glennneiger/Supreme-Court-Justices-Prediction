mr.
thomas
e.
harris
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
michigan.
it
is
before
the
court
on
the
pleadings,
the
courts
below
having
dismissed
the
plaintiff's
second
amended
declarations.
it
is
a
suit
for
damages
for
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
newspaper
guild
of
detroit
and
the
respondent,
the
evening
news
association,
which
publishes
a
newspaper
in
that
city.
the
plaintiff
sued
on
his
own
behalf
and
as
the
assignee
of
49
other
named
employees
of
the
newspaper.
the
second
amended
declaration
as
alleged
is
as
follows.
the
plaintiff
and
his
assignees
were
employees
of
the
newspaper
and
were
members
of
the
union,
the
newspaper
guild
of
detroit.
at
all
irrelevant
times,
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
in
effect
between
the
guild
and
the
respondent
newspaper.
this
agreement
provided
and
this
language
appears
on
page
five
of
the
record,
“there
shall
be
no
discrimination
against
any
employee
because
of
his
membership
or
activity
in
the
guild.
the
declaration
goes
on
to
allege
that
while
this
contract
was
in
effect,
there
was
a
strike
at
the
newspaper
by
a
union
other
than
the
guild.
that
during
the
strike,
the
guild
members,
that
is
the
plaintiff
and
his
assignors,
were
ready
and
willing
to
work
during
the
strike
but
that
the
newspaper
would
not
permit
them
to,
that
it
locked
them
out
in
whole
or
in
part.
but
that
--
at
the
same
time,
the
paper
permitted
other
employees
who
did
not
belong
to
any
union
to
work.
the
declaration
alleges
that
this
discrimination
violated
the
contract
and
it
asked
$20,000
in
damages.
the
respondent
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
following
grounds,
this
is
the
respondent's
language.
one,
defendant
is
charged
with
x
which
if
true
constitute
an
unfair
labor
practice
as
defined
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended.
two,
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
been
vested
by
virtue
of
such
amended
act
with
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
the
parties
stipulated
that
the
respondent
is
engaged
in
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
they
were
in
agreement
in
the
courts
below
and
are
in
agreement
here
also
that
the
language
of
the
contract
in
part
parallel
section
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
so
that
the
acts
alleged
as
a
violation
of
the
contract
would
also
be
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
trial
court
granted
the
respondent's
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
affirmed.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
there
is
a
statute
in
michigan
which
allows
a
union
to
sue
as
an
entity
and
that
statute
appears
to
me
to
permit
a
union
to
sue.
however,
the
michigan
cases
mostly
seemed
to
be
brought
by
these
class
suits
or
by
individual
union
members.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
it
does
not
appear
to
me
that
it
is
required
and
i
think
that
the
explanation
is
that
this
suit
was
filed
during
the
period
between
westinghouse
and
lincoln
mills,
and
that
is
--
and
the
westinghouse
decision
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
well,
the
westinghouse
was
interpreted
by
some
people
and
the
respondent's
still
interprets
it
as
saying
that
only
the
individuals
can
sue.
i
think
that
is
a
mistaken
interpretation
in
and
all
the
way
it
was,
but
it
is
an
interpretation
that
had
some
currency
in
the
lower
court.
there
was
no
reason
that
the
union
could
not
have
been
joined
apart
from
the
misapprehension
on
that
point.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
i
mean
that
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
case
of
hostility
between
the
plaintiffs
and
the
union
or
that
the
union
has
undertaken
to
settle
the
case
or
that
it
refused
to
take
it
to
arbitration
or
anything
of
that
sort.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
dismissed
the
case
on
the
broad
ground
at
the
pre-emption
doctrine
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
second
garmon
case
controlled.
it
quoted
at
length
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
that
case
and
from
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
harlan
and
said
that
under
either
one
federal
pre-emption
apply.
in
other
words,
it
treated
this
case
just
as
if
it
had
been
a
support
case
or
an
equity
case.
it
rejected
the
contention
that
a
suit
for
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
called
for
a
different
pre-emption
rule.
the
question
here
thus
is
whether
his
suit
on
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
breach
of
the
agreement
may
be
maintained.
when
the
acts
claimed
to
constitute
the
breach
would
also
constitute
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
now
we
contend
that
in
a
series
of
cases
at
the
last
term,
this
court
held
that
the
pre-emption
doctrine
of
such
cases
as
garmon
is
not
applicable
in
a
suit
for
breach
of
collective
bargaining
agreement.
we
do
not
believe
these
cases
are
distinguishable
on
any
relevant
ground.
secondly,
we
contend
that
the
same
result
should
be
reached
in
any
event
if
the
issue
is
regarded
as
an
open
one.
the
first
of
the
cases
which
seems
to
us
decisive
of
those
at
the
last
term
is
dowd
box
against
courtney.
that
was
a
suit
brought
in
state
court
in
massachusetts
by
local
union
officers
as
representatives
of
the
membership
of
the
union.
it
was
brought
--
i
take
it
as
a
class
suit.
there,
the
union
--
there
had
been
a
contract
in
effect
between
the
union
and
the
company
and
negotiations
looking
to
a
modification
of
the
contract
had
taken
place.
the
union
claimed
that
certain
--
to
go
about
changes
including
a
wage
increase
had
been
agreed
to.
the
company
however
repudiated
the
new
agreement
on
the
ground
that
its
bargaining
representatives
had
acted
without
authority.
(inaudible)
the
complaint
as
for
a
declaration
that
a
new
or
modified
contract
was
in
effect
and
was
legally
binding
and
for
a
many
judgment,
apparently
the
first
half
of
this
period
became
moot
to
the
passage
of
time
while
the
litigation
was
going
on.
and
the
final
decree
entered
in
the
massachusetts
courts
awarded
specific
sums
of
money
to
named
employees,
the
amounts
being
the
difference
of
the
higher
wages
provided
by
the
new
contract
from
those
do
under
the
old
contract.
now,
here
the
--
and
then
massachusetts
too,
the
company
argued
federal
pre-emption
on
two
grounds.
they
said
first,
that
the
suit
couldn't
be
brought
in
state
court
because
it
should've
been
brought
in
federal
court,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
under
section
301
(a)
is
exclusive.
it
argued
secondly
that
the
conduct
alleged
also
amounted
to
an
unfair
labor
practice,
that
is,
the
company's
repudiation
of
its
bargaining
representatives
was
a
refusal
to
bargain.
and
it
argued
that
at
least
in
that
situation
federal
jurisdiction
but
though
the
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
courts
rather
than
of
the
board
should
be
exclusive.
this
court
rejected
the
claim
of
federal
pre-emption.
it
pointed
out
that
the
congress
in
enacting
the
taft-hartley
act
had
deliberately
dropped
proposals
to
make
breach
of
contract
and
unfair
labor
practice.
both
the
taft
bill
in
the
senate
and
the
hartley
bill
in
the
house
have
contained
such
provisions.
they
were
however
dropped
in
conference.
and
this
court
quoted
from
the
report
of
the
house
conferees
as
follows.
once
parties
have
made
a
collective
bargaining
contract,
the
enforcement
of
that
contract
should
be
left
the
usual
processes
of
the
law
and
not
the
national
labor
relations
board.
this
court
declared
that
the
considerations
which
had
let
it
define
pre-emption
in
such
cases
as
garner,
garmon,
anheuser-busch
were
not
applicable
to
suits
for
breach
of
collective
bargaining
agreements,
because
congress
had
not
elected
to
entrust
cases
growing
out
of
such
a
breach
exclusively
to
the
nlrb
but
had
left
them
to
the
courts.
in
answer
to
the
claim
that
federal
jurisdiction
under
301
(a)
was
exclusive,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
purpose
of
that
provision
was
to
provide
an
additional
remedy
not
to
contract
an
existing
one.
finally,
an
answer
to
the
contention
that
diversities
and
conflicts
of
doctrine
would
result
from
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
this
situation
the
court
stated
that
the
federal
common
law
of
labor
relations
would
control
so
that
this
court
could,
if
need
be,
resolve
such
conflicts
and
diversities.
now
the
court
in
its
opinion
did
not
explicitly
point
out
that
the
conduct
alleged
to
as
a
breach
of
contract
was
also
an
unfair
labor
practice.
it
can
hardly
have
escaped
the
court's
attention
however.
the
opinion
seems
in
part
directed
to
that
point
and
the
case
was
argued
at
the
same
time
as
lucas
flour
which
also
involved
that
point.
and
then
lucas
flour
which
was
decided
shortly
after
dowd
box,
the
dowd
box
opinion
is
cited
on
that
point.
lucas
flour
is
the
second
of
the
cases
at
the
last
term
which
we
think
disposed
of
this
issue.
that
is
rather
the
reversed
situation
of
dowd
box.
there
the
employers
sued
the
union
for
damages
for
a
strike
claimed
to
be
in
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
--
an
agreement
did
not
have
a
specific
no-strike
clause,
it
had
a
provision
for
final
and
binding
arbitration
of
issues
including
issues
as
to
discharge
of
an
employee
which
was
what
had
provoked
the
strike.
the
substantive
issue
which
was
before
this
court
was
whether
in
that
situation
a
strike
was
a
violation
of
the
contract.
the
union
contended
of
course
that
it
was
not
and
that
the
strike
was
therefore
protected
concerted
activity
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
it
also
argued
that
since
its
defense
raised
this
issue
within
the
competence
of
the
nlrb
that
the
pre-emption
doctrine
of
garmon
should
apply.
this
court
disposed
of
this
contention
in
a
footnote,
footnote
9
in
369
united
states,
at
page
101.
it
said
that
since
this
was
a
suit
for
breach
of
contract
that
the
doctrine
of
--
the
pre-emption
doctrine
did
not
apply.
it
cited
a
number
of
court
of
appeals
decisions
which
have
held
that
a
suit
for
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
maybe
maintained
even
though
the
acts
constituting
the
breach
are
also
an
unfair
labor
practice.
that
is
the
general
rule
followed
which
has
been
followed
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
i
think
the
way
the
state
court
authority
probably
is
the
other
way.
anyway
this
court
cited
those
cases
which
hold
that.
it
cited
the
dowd
box
case
and
finally
before
it
said,
“it
is
of
course
true
that
conduct
which
is
a
violation
of
a
contractual
obligation
may
also
be
conduct
constituting
an
unfair
labor
practice.”
and
what
has
been
said
is
not
to
imply
that
enforcement
by
a
court
of
a
contract
obligation
affects
the
jurisdiction
of
the
nlrb
to
remedy
unfair
labor
practices
as
such.
the
final
case
which
seems
to
us
dispositive
of
the
issue
is
atkinson
v.
sinclair
which
in
this
respect
was
very
like
lucas
flour.
that
is,
it
was
a
suit
for
a
strike
in
alleged
violation
of
a
contract.
it
had
the
additional
feature
that
one
count
of
the
suit
was
laid
against
individual
employees
and
purported
to
be
and
federal
jurisdiction
now
is
invoked
on
grounds
of
diversity.
the
court
disposed
of
the
pre-emption
contention
in
our
footnote
simply
saying
again
that
it
doesn't
apply
in
suits
for
breach
of
collective
agreements.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
no,
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
get
--
look
for
the
same
result
even
if
it
is
not
maintained.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
i
do
not
think
it
is.
i
think
that
if
the
suit
is
maintainable
under
301
that
that
would
dispose
of
it
but
i
would
think
that
the
court
should
reach
the
same
result
anyway.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
yes,
i
will.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
i
think
it
has
been
overruled.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
but
i
think
that
there
are
numerous
other
grounds
on
which
this
case
has
to
be
decided
against
the
respondent
anyway.
now
in
our
brief,
we
have
an
inordinate
length,
reargued
the
question
which
i
contend
it
was
disposed
off
in
these
cases.
we
have
argued
that
even
if
the
issue
be
treated
as
an
open
one,
the
court
should
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
pre-emption
doctrine
of
garmon
and
garner
does
not
apply
in
contract
actions.
i
will
go
over
that
very
hurriedly
since
these
points
are
not
as
i
understand
it,
directly
controverted
by
respondent.
we
say
in
essence
that
there
is
really
no
way
that
courts
can
avoid
sometimes
getting
into
issues
which
are
within
the
competence
of
the
nlrb.
lucas
flour
for
example
is
a
case
just
of
that
sort.
there,
the
claim
that
the
strike
was
protected
activity
if
that
had
precluded
judicial
jurisdiction,
no
remedy
would
have
been
available
to
the
company.
again,
the
board
has
found
it
necessary
to
decide
precisely
the
issue
which
this
court
decided
in
that
case.
for
example,
when
a
strike
takes
place,
under
board
doctrine
if
the
strike
is
in
violation
of
a
contract,
the
employer
may
discharge
the
employees.
therefore
when
that
happens,
it
is
necessary
for
the
board
to
decide
whether
the
strike
violates
the
contract.
and
in
the
mead
case,
exactly
on
facts
exactly
like
those
in
lucas
flour,
the
board
did
hold
that
a
strike
over
an
issue
which
the
contract
says
maybe
submitted
to
final
combining
arbitration
violates
the
contract,
so
that
the
employer
was
within
his
rights
in
discharging
the
employees.
that
of
course,
is
exactly
the
issue
of
interpretation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
this
court
decided
in
lucas
flour.
and
this
court
cited
the
mead
case
and
other
board
cases
for
its
ruling.
so
that
there
really
is
no
way
as
we
see
it
that
cases
--
that
issues
can
be
taken
in
one
category
and
the
courts
can
be
kept
out
of
them
or
that
the
board
on
the
other
hand
can
be
kept
out
of
issues
of
contract
interpretation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
such
sections
as
8
(e),
the
so-called
hot
cargo
clause
of
the
contract
of
the
taft-hartley
act
as
amended
by
landrum-griffin,
make
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
parties
to
enter
into
a
specified
type
of
agreement.
so
the
board
automatically
is
in
the
business
of
deciding
whether
the
agreements
have
been
entered
into
and
of
interpreting
those
agreements.
it
does
the
same
thing
under
the
union
security
provisions
of
course.
but
let
me
pass
that
and
come
to
the
respondent's
contentions.
now,
as
i
said
below
the
respondent
argued
broadly
as
such
cases
as
garmon
apply
equally
to
suits
for
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
that's
what
the
michigan
courts
held.
that
argument
i
take
it
is
no
longer
open
and
i
for
--
and
i
take
it
in
recognition
of
that,
the
respondent
now
undertakes
to
support
the
decision
below
on
various
narrower
grounds.
it
undertakes
to
distinguish
the
decisions
of
the
last
term
on
two
grounds.
first,
the
respondent
says
that
the
contractual
provision
here
directly
parallels
the
content
of
section
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
so
that
its
enforcement
in
the
courts
involves
the
possibility
of
a
more
direct
conflict
with
nlrb
doctrine
then
was
involved
in
the
cases
at
the
last
term.
however,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
get
a
possibility
of
anymore
direct
conflict
and
was
present
in
the
lucas
flour
case,
the
very
issue
which
the
court
decided
there
was
one
which
have
been
decided
by
the
board
and
the
court
relied
on
board
decisions
as
well
as
on
court
decisions
of
--
for
its
interpretation
of
the
contract.
in
other
argument,
the
respondent
makes
is
that
here
the
remedy
available
before
the
nlrb
would
parallel
that
available
in
court,
that
is
back
wages.
and
that
this
was
not
true
of
the
cases
at
the
last
term.
that
is
true
but
the
second
garmon
decision
explicitly
holds
that
it
is
not
the
comparability
of
remedies
which
determines
a
pre-emption
or
the
lack
of
pre-emption
but
wholly
different
considerations.
also,
the
respondent
undertakes
to
lay
cases
involving
arbitration
to
one
side.he
undertakes
to
say
that
--
or
to
concede
that
arbitrators
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
or
that
courts
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
enforcing
agreements
to
arbitrate
or
in
enforcing
arbitration
awards.
the
respondent
seems
to
consider
this
required
by
the
warrior
case,
lincoln
mills
and
so
on.
however,
the
possibility
of
conflict
with
nlrb
doctrine
is
just
as
great
in
arbitration
as
it
is
in
suits
for
damages.
professor
christensen
of
the
nyu
law
school
has
written
a
very
lengthy
article
on
the
point
here
at
issue
which
appears
in
37
nyu
law
review
411
in
support
of
the
respondent's
position
here.
his
principal
concern
however
is
the
danger
of
conflict
between
arbitration
and
the
nlrb
and
there
of
course
is
a
conflict
between
arbitration
and
the
nlrb.
but,
the
nlrb
doesn't
have
to
accept
the
result
if
it
doesn't
want
to.
let
me
give
with
a
single
example.
there
is
probably
no
issue
which
is
more
arbitrated
than
employer
discharges
of
employees
for
conduct
during
a
strike.
now,
nearly
every
collective
bargaining
agreement
contains
a
provision
that
an
employer
may
discharge
only
for
cost
or
for
just
cost.
this
same
standard
is
in
effect
written
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
provides
that
the
board
can't
reinstate
employees
discharged
for
cost.
so
that
in
end,
that
there
is
no
common
or
type
of
arbitration
and
there
is
no
common
or
type
of
board
case.
now
the
respondent
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
here,
the
contractual
language
parallels
8
(a)
(3)
rather
specifically.
the
result
however
would
be
just
the
same
if
it
were
these
standard
contract
clause
prohibiting
discharge
except
for
cost
because
no
court
or
arbitrator
will
uphold
the
discharge
for
conduct
protected
under
the
national
act,
so
that
the
(inaudible)
--
the
result
is
the
same
anyway.
now
in
these
cases,
the
board
either
orders
the
employee
reinstated
and
either
finds
that
he
did
not
engage
in
misconduct
warranting
discharge.
if
it
finds
that,
it
orders
you
reinstated
with
back
pay.
now,
the
arbitrators
apply
pretty
much
the
same
substantive
standard
but
they
very
often
resort
to
compromise
solutions
with
the
nlrb,
it
is
all
or
not
--
or
nothing.
with
an
arbitrator
on
the
other
hand,
they
quite
often
order
reinstatement
but
without
back
pay
or
they
sustained
suspension
for
some
given
period
of
time
or
some
intermediate
result
like
that.
the
fact
that
the
arbitrators
do
tailor
the
remedy
in
a
fashion
that
the
board
does
not
--
is
one
reason
for
that
the
union
so
often
resort
to
arbitration
in
these
cases.
and
of
course,
there
is
in
the
sense
that
the
diverging
remedy
would
be
a
possibility
of
a
different
result
from
that
which
would
be
had
before
the
nlrb.
however,
in
these
cases,
the
board
has
said
that
it
will
follow
the
arbitration
absent
some
good
reason
for
not
doing
so.and
that
is
the
board's
own
policy
and
has
been
for
many
years.
also,
i
do
not
see
any
way
that
this
court
could
reach
the
result
that
there
is
pre-emption
in
damage
suits
for
breach
of
contract
but
no
pre-emption
in
arbitration.
the
question
of
pre-emption
turns
ultimately
on
the
intention
of
congress,
real
or
imputed.
and
i
do
not
know
how
anyone
could
impute
to
the
congress
which
enacted
the
taft-hartley
act,
an
intention
to
prefer
arbitration
over
suits
for
damages
as
respect
to
pre-emption.
section
301
is
written
in
terms
of
suits
for
damages.
it
was
only
by
construction
that
suits
to
enforce
arbitration
agreements
were
brought
within
it.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
arguments
which
respondent
principally
makes
here
and
makes
for
the
first
time.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
we
have
not
briefed
the
point
whether
individuals
could
sue
under
section
301
(a)
because
we
think
it's
most
unlikely
that
the
court
were
rigid.
there
being
so
many
other
grounds
of
disposing
of
the
case
which
i
will
come
to.
the
point
is
briefed
in
a
footnote
in
the
government's
reply
brief
and
is
briefed
by
respondent.
i
would
think
that
the
question
of
the
right
of
individuals
to
sue
under
section
301
(a)
should
be
controlled
by
the
determination
of
the
substantive
issue
of
their
right
under
collective
bargaining
agreements
rather
than
as
a
procedural
matter.
and
i
--
as
i
understand
that
that
what
is
the
government
is
saying.
in
other
words,
if
it
is
held
that
individuals
have
rights
under
collective
agreements
which
they
can
enforce
separately,
which
they
can
enforce
in
a
state
court
for
example,
then
i
think
that
they
should
be
permitted
to
sue
under
section
301
(a).
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
an
absurd
result
to
say
that
they
could
sue
only
in
state
court
and
not
under
301
(a).
there
is
some
language
in
the
legislative
history
by
mr.
martin
which
is
set
forth
in
the
government's
brief
which
supports
this
contention.
there's
also
some
legislative
history
just
the
opposite
ways
which
is
set
forth
in
the
respondent's
brief.
now,
respondent's
principal
contention
here
is
that
this
case
differs
from
those
decided
by
the
last
term.
in
that,
it
is
controlled
by
state
substantive
law
while
those
were
controlled
by
federal
law.
therefore,
according
to
the
respondent,
the
pre-emption
doctrine
of
garmon
and
that
line
of
authorities
must
be
applied
to
prevent
conflicts
of
doctrines
which
this
court
could
not
resolve
since
this
court
may
not
review
state
substantive
law.
if
we
agreed
that
state
substantive
law
controlled
here,
i
think
we
would
agree
that
the
pre-emption
doctrines
should
be
applied.
however,
we
do
not.
the
key
issue
thus
between
us
is
whether
state
law,
state
substantive
law
controls.
now
to
--
for
establishing
that
it
--
the
state
law
controls
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
i
think
that
there
are
strong
considerations
for
finding
pre-emption
in
that
event
simply
because
the
decisions
would
be
unreviewable
by
this
court
except
of
course
on
the
issue
of
pre-emption.
that
is,
this
court
could
not
review
substantive
state
doctrine.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
and
i
would
agree
with
them
that
this
court
should
apply
pre-emption
doctrines
in
that
event.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
it
is
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
no,
i
don't
think
so
and
i
will
get
to
that
point
right
now,
your
honor.
for
the
proposition
that
state
law
controls,
a
respondent
goes
back
to
the
westinghouse
case.
it
says
that
that
case
holds
that
suit
on
a
right
uniquely
personal
to
the
employees
such
as
wages
may
not
be
brought
by
a
union
in
federal
court
under
section
301
(a)
or
by
the
employees
in
federal
court
under
301
(a)
but
only
by
the
employees
in
a
state
court
if
this
is
a
suit
like
that.
and
that
federal
substantive
law
applies
only
in
suits
which
are
or
could
have
been
brought
by
the
union
under
section
301
(a)
and
that
this
is
not
such
a
suit.
now
let
us
consider
first
this
question
of
the
reach
of
the
federal
common
law
of
labor
relations
which
is
i
think
the
most
important
issue
presented
by
this
case.
now
the
respondent
contends,
we
think
it
is
a
misapprehension
that
this
body
of
federal
common
law
exist
solely
by
virtue
of
section
301
(a)
and
the
interpretation
which
this
court
gave
that
section
in
the
lincoln
mills
case.
and
they
say
that
this
law
therefore
applies
only
in
suits
within
the
procedural
reach
of
section
301
(a).
they
argue
that
even
in
a
diversity
case
in
the
federal
courts
state
substantive
law
would
have
to
control
under
the
doctrine
of
erie
railroad
against
tompkins.
now,
we
don't
believe
that
the
reach
of
the
federal
common
law
of
labor
relations
is
limited
in
any
such
fashion.
we
suggest
that
it
encompasses
all
issues
as
to
the
negotiation,
interpretation,
and
enforcement
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
for
example,
this
court
has
held
that
a
union
in
negotiating
a
contract
must
fairly
represent
all
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit.
and
then
it
may
not
discriminate
against
any
of
them
on
grounds
for
instance
of
reach.
this
court
laid
down
that
doctrine
in
the
steel
case,
a
case
decided
before
the
taft-hartley
act.
it
was
first
applied
in
contracts
negotiated
under
the
railway
labor
act
but
it
has
since
been
extended
to
contracts
negotiated
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
again,
this
court
has
held
that
in
negotiating
a
new
contract,
a
union
may,
if
it
acts
in
good
faith
terminate
or
modify
existing
contractual
rights
such
as
seniority
rights
which
the
employees
enjoyed
under
the
prior
contract.
this
court
ruled
that
way
in
ford
motor
company
against
huffman
in
345
u.s.
that
was
a
diversity
suit
brought
by
individual
employees.
no
suggestion
of
section
301
in
that
suit.
now
surely
these
federal
substantive
doctrines
must
apply
in
all
the
contract
negotiation.
they
cannot
conceivably
be
limited
to
suits
brought
under
301
(a)
or
suits
in
which
could
have
been
brought
under
301
(a).
neither
those
suits
were
maintained
or
belong
to
301
(a),
they
weren't
suits
for
violation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
they
were
the
reverse.
the
dissatisfied
employees
complained
that
the
union
and
the
employer
were
applying
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
we
submit
that
federal
substantive
law
has
to
control
on
a
wide
range
of
other
questions
involving
the
relationships
among
the
employer,
the
union,
and
the
individual
employees.
it
must
control
for
example
on
the
power
of
the
union
to
settle
the
dispute
with
the
employer,
without
the
acquiescence
or
over
the
objection
of
the
employees
concerned.
i'm
not
taking
a
position
on
how
that
question
is
answered,
if
your
honors
understand.i'm
merely
saying
that
federal
law
must
control
the
answer.
again,
it
must
con
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
i
don't
believe
that
the
body
of
federal
common
law
goes
back
that
far,
so
that
i
would
not
be
able
to
find
a
federal
policy
on
that
which
antedated
the
wagner
act.
i
believe
however,
that
it
quite
clearly
goes
back
beyond
lincoln
mills
and
that
it
would've
had
to
be
developed
even
if
lincoln
mills
had
been
decided
the
other
way.
i
think
the
--
that
this
court
would've
had
to
decide
whether
a
union
could
discriminate
against
certain
members
for
example,
or
whether
it
owed
a
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith
for
all
members.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
well,
i
think
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
do
it
just
on
that
basis
though
i
have
sometimes
--
the
hutchison
case,
of
course,
suggest
that
there
were
some
possibilities
there.
now,
another
question
as
i've
already
indicated
which
it
seems
to
me
has
to
be
controlled
by
federal
law
is
whether
individual
employees
have
individual
rights
which
they
may
enforce
independently
of
or
in
opposition
to
the
union.
again,
let's
suppo
--
again,
here,
the
respondent
could
have
urged
for
instance
that
the
union
and
the
respondent
had
entered
into
a
binding
settlement
of
the
claims
sued
of,
or
that
the
suit
should
be
stayed
pending
arbitration
or
dismissed
because
of
the
union's
failure
to
take
the
case
to
arbitration.
i
think
any
of
those
defenses
would
have
been
controlled
by
a
federal
law.
as
--
respects
the
availability
of
arbitration,
atkinson
and
sinclair
and
(inaudible)
both
seem
to
indicate
that
this
federal
law
that
would
control
the
sufficiency
of
that
contention.
now,
if
respondent's
contention
that
the
reach
of
federal
law
is
restricted
by
the
jurisdictional
reach
of
301
(a)
were
accepted,
it
would
get
a
number
of
absurd
results.
in
the
first
place,
uniform
federal
law
which
prevailed
as
to
rights
running
to
or
against
a
union
but
rights
personal
to
employees
would
be
subject
to
the
big
reason
of
state
law.
states
would
even
be
free
to
adopt
the
conservative
view
of
the
privy
council
or
the
radical
view
of
dean
shulman
that
collective
bargaining
agreements
are
mere
moral
obligations,
not
enforceable
at
all.
i
don't
suppose
that
the
states
would
adopt
such
a
principle
but
they
would
be
free
too.
secondly,
however,
according
to
respondent,
federal
doctrine
would
still
impinge
even
if
as
to
these
rights
personal
to
employees
if
the
case
involved
issues
are
arguably
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
nlrb
such
as
this
one
or
in
that
even
pre-emption
doctrines
would
come
into
play.
thirdly,
the
courts
would
have
to
decide
in
each
case
whether
the
right
asserted
runs
to
the
employee
individually
or
to
the
union.
as
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
in
westinghouse,
that
is
a
difficult
determination.
the
lower
courts
were
not
even
in
agreement
on
whether
an
individual
employee
may
sue
for
discharge
in
alleged
violation
of
a
contract.
that
is
perhaps
the
commonest
to
all
employee
claims
but
there
is
wide
diversity
among
the
state
courts
on
whether
the
employee
may
assert
this
or
only
the
union.
new
york,
who
whilst
that
the
union
may
assert
it.
some
other
states,
all
--
the
employee
made.
each
state
court
determination
on
statistic
whether
a
right
was
an
individual
one
or
whether
it
ran
to
the
union,
would
itself
present
a
federal
question
subject
to
review
by
this
court.
let's
consider
another
difficulty.
many
rights
have
what
the
former
professor
clark's
told
a
double
aspect.
this
is
such
a
provision,
a
provision
against
discrimination
on
account
of
union
membership
or
activity,
certainly
is
not
for
the
sole
benefit
of
individual
employees.
it
is
through
the
protection
of
the
union
as
an
entity
also.
so
that
surely
the
union
too
would
be
entitled
to
force
that
--
enforce
that
right.
now
according
to
respondent,
you
apparently
would
have
the
result
that
if
the
union
sued
to
enforce
that
right,
federal
law
would
control
and
the
suit
could
be
brought
in
federal
court.
but
if
the
individual
employee
sued
to
enforce
it,
it
could
only
be
brought
in
state
court.
now
look
at
ballot
box,
there,
there
were
two
prayers
for
relief
bags,
one,
a
declaration
that
the
whole
of
contract
was
valid,
second,
a
prayer
for
money
damages
or
lost
wages
for
individual
employees.
according
to
the
respondent,
the
first
of
these
would
be
a
suit
maintainable
by
the
union,
the
second
only
by
the
individual
employees.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
respondent
thinks
that
the
federal
law
would
control
as
to
half
of
the
action
and
state
law
as
to
the
other
half
or
when
the
first
cause
of
action
became
moot
whether
it
started
out
as
controlled
by
federal
law
and
ended
up
as
controlled
by
state
law
or
what.
actually
of
course,
when
the
case
reached
this
court,
it
involved
only
individual
claims
of
employees.
this
court
explicitly
held
that
federal
law
controlled
dowd
box
is
as
i
see
it,
a
complete
answer
to
respondent's
contention
on
this
point
because
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
claims
more
personal
to
the
employees
than
the
money
judgments
for
back
wages
entered
in
the
names
of
individual
employees
in
that
case.
yet
this
court
held
that
the
federal
common
law
controlled.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
according
to
the
respondent's
contention,
section
301
couldn't
govern
it.
according
to
their
contention,
that
would've
been
one
of
these
suits
on
rights
particularly
uniquely
personal
to
the
employees.
that
was
--
that
is
exactly
the
example
they
give,
a
suit
for
back
wages.
that
to
the
claim
suit
on
there
was
much
more
uniquely
personal
to
employees
than
the
ones
suit
on
here
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
--
because
certainly
the
provision
against
discrimination
on
account
of
union
activity
is
this
is
at
best
a
sort
of
mixed
provision
which
is
intended
for
the
benefit
of
the
union
no
--
as
an
entity,
no
less
than
of
the
employees.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
in
the
contract
in
this
case,
the
provision
that
employees
would
not
be
discriminated
against
for
guild
membership
or
activity
and
the
contention
is
that
during
a
strike,
the
guild
members
were
locked
out
in
whole
or
in
part
when
other
nine
union
members
were
permitted
to
work.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
that
is
the
specific
clause
in
the
contract.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
well,
that
is
an
issue
on
which
the
government
in
its
brief
amicus
and
the
respondent
are
not
in
agreement.
the
government
feels
that
if
employ
--
that
if
there
are
rights
on
which
employees
may
sue
in
state
court
that
they
should
also
be
permitted
to
sue
under
section
301
(a).
respondent
takes
the
reversed
position.
now,
it
may
be
that
--
in
further
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
i
would
say
it
is
not
absolutely
clear
whether
in
dowd
box,
this
court
held
that
the
suit
was
a
section
301
(a)
suit
or
whether
it
held
that
the
federal
common
law
controlled
anyway
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
but
either
way
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
either
way
it
appears
to
me
that
the
case
is
adverse
to
respondent
because
if
that
was
a
suit
maintainable
under
section
301
(a),
so
is
this.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
the
brief
shows
that
the
petitioner
also
argued
that
the
fact
that
the
conduct
amounted
to
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
--
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
no
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
i
would
have
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
but
i
would
have
to
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
i
would
have
to
disagree
with
your
honor.
i
think
the
court
explicitly
held
that
the
federal
common
law
did
control
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
and
in
dowd
box
also.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
and
the
--
that
was
essential
to
the
courts
reaching
their
result
it
did
because
the
argument
was
made
that
if
the
state
courts
were
allowed
to
entertain
these
suits
a
diversity
of
interpretations
of
the
act
and
of
the
contract
would
arise.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
both.
and
in
answer
this
court
specifically
said
in
dowd
box
that
federal
law
would
control
and
if
you
would
look,
mr.
justice,
that
the
final
sentence
of
your
opinion,
you
will
see
that
you
stated
that
to
resolve
these
diversities
in
conflicts
is
the
business
of
this
court.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
it
was
said
there
no
less
than
in
it,
lucas
flour.
now,
another
case
which
on
this
point
seems
to
me
decisive
against
the
respondent
is
atkinson
versus
sinclair.
there
your
honors
we'll
recall
the
second
count
sought
damages
from
individual
employees
for
a
strike
in
vio
--
or
for
intermittent
work
stoppages
in
violation
of
the
contract.
federal
jurisdiction
there
was
invoked
not
under
301
(a)
but
diversity
of
citizenship.
and
it
was
thought
to
state
a
cause
of
action
under
the
common
law
of
indiana.
this
court
held
however
that
federal
law
controlled
as
to
that
count
2.
now
it
isn't
clear
whether
the
court
meant
that
that
suit
could
have
been
brought
under
301
(a)
or
whether
it
meant
that
federal
law
controlled
anyway.
but
on
either
proposition,
it
is
fatal
to
the
respondents
because
if
those
individual
defendants
could
be
sued
under
301
(a)
these
individual
plaintiffs
here
presumably
can
sue
under
301
(a).
as
i
said
earlier
however
it
seems
to
me
that
the
truly
decisive
answer
to
the
contention
is
that
the
reach
of
the
federal
common
law
is
in
no
way
limited
by
the
jurisdictional
scope
of
301
(a).
it
antedated
301
(a)
the
federal
substantive
common
law
maybe
in
part
a
response
to
the
jurisdictional
grant
of
301
(a)
but
it
isn't
found
there.
it
is
found
elsewhere.perhaps
the
largest
body
being
in
section
7
and
8
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
but
some
of
it
is
simply
been
devised
by
this
court
out
of
its
own
sense
of
what
--
of
justice,
such
a
doctrine
in
the
steel
case
for
example.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
i
think
it
is
based
on
the
court's
conception
that
what
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
--
would
require
in
the
case
of
a
union
which
is
by
law
the
exclusive
bargaining
represented
to
each
everyone.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
or
perhaps
even
the
constitution.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
we
do
not
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
none
of
which
i
know.
now,
actually
even
the
westinghouse
case
to
begin
with,
did
not
hold
as
the
respondent
asserts
it
to
hold.
five
of
the
eight
justices
who
participated
in
that
case
expressed
the
view
that
a
union
may
enforce
a
wage
claim.
now
a
majority
of
the
court
did
hold
that
under
--
that
301
(a)
should
be
construed
--
should
not
be
construed
as
conferring
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
courts
over
a
suit
while
whomever
brought
to
enforce
the
wage
provisions
of
a
contract.
but
there
was
no
majority
for
the
provision
that
the
proposition
that
a
union
couldn't
enforce
those
provisions.
i
think
the
restrictive
interpretation
given
to
section
301
(a)
in
westinghouse
rested
primarily
on
the
court's
desire
to
avoid
the
question
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
section
301
(a)
under
article
3
of
the
constitution,
which
would
arise
unless
the
sections
were
given
substitute
content.
and
upon
the
court's
reluctance
to
give
its
substantive
content
as
justice
frankfurter
put
it
in
that
case
to
work
out
without
more
a
federal
code,
governing
collective
bargaining
agreements.
however
in
lincoln
mills,
the
court
did
face
the
constitutional
issue
and
it
held
that
section
301
(a)
was
not
only
jurisdictional
but
empowered
the
court
to
fashion
a
federal
common
law
for
collective
bargaining
agreements.
that
develop
was
continued
in
the
arbitration
cases
and
in
the
cases
at
the
last
term.
and
i
think
that
the
development
of
that
common
law
of
collective
agreements
makes
it
clear
that
westinghouse
has
no
lingering
validity.
finally,
even
if
westinghouse
held
as
the
respondent
contends
it
should
and
even
if
it
were
good
law,
it
is
very
doubtful
that
it
would
win
the
case
for
the
respondent,
because
the
contractual
clause
suit
on
here
is
not
uniquely
personal
to
employees
in
the
sense
of
the
clause
in
westinghouse
clause.
as
i
said,
it
is
plainly
for
the
benefit
of
the
union
as
an
entity
and
for
the
protection
of
the
union
as
well
as
of
the
individual
employees.
so
that
on
any
rational,
surely
the
union
suit
to
enforce
it
and
could
have
sued
under
301
(a).
so
that
even
according
to
respondent's
own
contentions,
federal
law
would
control.
now,
sets
for
a
number
of
reasons,
we
think
that
federal
and
not
state
substantive
law
is
controlling.
we
see
no
basis
for
differentiating
this
case
from
dowd
box
and
lucas
flour
in
which
it
was
held
that
the
pre-emption
doctrine
of
garmon
is
not
applicable
in
suits
for
breach
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
reserve
the
balance
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
i
would
like
if
i
may
to
give
the
court
a
concrete
illustration
of
why
it
is
that
we
are
anxious
to
preserve
the
concurrent
arbitral
and
judicial
remedy
even
in
situations
where
we
could
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
in
1955
there
was
a
long
invidious
strike
against
the
southern
bell
telephone
company.
at
the
end
of
that
strike,
the
strike
settlement
agreement
provided
as
it
very
often
does,
that
the
employees
who
had
been
discharged
by
the
company
some
226
employees
had
been
discharged
during
the
strike
for
alleged
misconduct.
the
settlement
agreement
provided
that
these
226
discharges
would
be
submitted
to
arbitration.
the
arbitration
took
several
weeks.
in
the
end
a
majority
of
the
employees
were
put
back
to
work.
the
next
year,
1956,
there
was
a
strike
at
cowler.
some
60
employees
were
discharged
for
alleged
misconduct.
the
issue
of
the
reinstatement
of
those
60
employees
at
cowler
is
still
before
the
national
labor
relations
board.
in
fact,
the
end
is
not
yet
in
sight.
that
is
why
we
are
so
anxious
to
preserve
the
arbitral
remedy
and
we
see
no
way
of
distinguishing
between
arbitration
and
damage
suits.
now,
our
counsel
for
respondent
mentioned
the
case
of
glidden
company
against
zdanok,
z-d-a-n-o-k.
that
case
of
course
was
before
this
court
last
year
only
on
a
quite
different
point,
the
right
of
a
court
of
claims
judge
to
sit
on
the
court
of
appeals.
it
does
however,
i
agree
illustrate
very
well
the
problem
as
to
the
reach
of
the
federal
common
law
of
labor
relations.
that
was
a
plant
closing
case.
the
employer
closed
a
plant
in
long
island
and
shifted
the
work
from
there
into
another
plant
in
bethlehem,
pennsylvania.
the
union
tried
to
take
the
--
tried
to
compel
arbitration
in
the
new
york
states
courts
but
the
suit
was
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
the
contract
covering
the
long
island
plant
had
expired.
then
individual
employees
sued
in
the
federal
court
on
diversity
of
citizenship.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
ruled
in
their
favor.
it
held
that
their
seniority
rights
under
the
expired
contract
covering
the
long
island
plant
attached
to
the
other
plant
in
bethlehem,
pennsylvania
that
they
were
entitled
to
go
to
work
in
the
pennsylvania
plant
with
their
old
seniority
rights.
the
majority
of
the
second
circuit
held
that
new
york
substantive
law
controlled
on
that
point.
judge
lumbard
dissenting
said,
“no,
this
is
a
thing
on
which
there
should
be
a
uniform
federal
principle
and
federal
substantive
law
should
control.”
and
i
submit
that
that
case
perfectly
illustrates
that
federal
law
should
control.
in
other
situations
where
a
plant
closes,
it
is
quite
often
for
a
union
to
enter
into
an
agreement
as
to
the
consequences
of
a
closing,
severance
play,
employment
rights
at
the
new
plant
and
so
forth
whether
that
is
done
even
according
to
the
respondent.
federal
substantive
law
would
control
because
--
the
enforcement
of
the
agreement
as
to
the
consequences
of
the
closing.
surely
it
would
be
absurd
to
have
federal
law
control
in
the
one
situation
and
state
to
common
law
control
in
the
other.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
i
rather
think
that
even
in
that
situation,
the
court
would
still
have
jurisdiction
but
it
appears
to
me
that
both
there
and
in
a
good
many
other
situations
i
can
think
of,
the
court
should
in
its
discretion
refuse
to
entertain
the
suit
on
the
ground
that
it
is
a
matter
better
left
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
an
illustration
of
that
was
a
holding
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
i
would
think
that
it
should
not
here.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
as
this
is
a
normal
provision
in
a
collective
agreement
not
materially
different
from
the
typical
provision
that
there
shall
be
a
discharge
only
for
just
cause.
i
think
to
refer
to
this
sort
of
matter
to
the
board
would
cut
too
deeply
into
the
normal
arbitral
process
and
the
normal
judicial
process.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
i
think
that
it
would
be
desirable
in
a
number
of
cases
or
types
of
situations
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
--
for
the
court
to
do
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
well
--
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
well,
there
are
some
difficulties.
one
is
this
very
short
statute
of
limitations
with
the
board
six
months.
the
other
is
that
the
party
has
no
absolute
right
to
institute
a
proceeding
before
the
board.
that
right
is
vested
only
in
the
general
counsels
of
the
board
so
that
there
is
not
a
really
true
choice
of
remedies
here.
even
so,
i
think
that
there
are
some
situations
even
which
where
as
i
contend
the
court
has
jurisdiction
that
it
should
say
that
it
would
prefer
to
leave
this
to
the
board,
just
as
the
board
now
quite
frequently
or
refuses
to
handle
issues
of
contractual
interpretation
even
within
its
jurisdiction
on
the
ground
that
they
are
better
handled
by
arbitration.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
harris
its
--
it
is
a
very
practical
difficulty.
thank
you.
