mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
this
is
my
initial
appearance
before
the
court.
i
hope
that
in
these
difficult
areas
of
pre-emption
and
301
which
have
been
likened
to
delphic
mysteries
and
dark
rooms
that
i
won't
be
able
to
be
of
assistance
to
the
court.
we
do
have
a
subject
of
pre-emption
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
we're
at
the
bedrock
of
whether
or
not
the
doctrine
of
pre-emption
in
the
area
of
labor
contracts
is
relevant
and
can
be
applied
at
all.
and
as
to
the
reach
and
scope
of
301,
i
think
we
have
finally
come
to
the
question
of
whether
westinghouse
is
alive
or
dead,
were
used
mr.
harris'
remark
which
i
liken
a
dustbin
of
history.
we
must
determine
it
seems
to
me
in
this
action
whether
this
suit
by
an
individual
employee
for
back
pay
is
within
the
purview
of
that
section
or
not
because
we
are
at
least
agreed
that
if
this
suit
is
not
governed
by
federal
common
law,
that
then
though
it
be
on
a
contract,
pre-emption
should
apply.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
i
referred
to
the
dissenting
opinion
of
the
chief
justice.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
but
--
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
no.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
that
i
realized
your
honor.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
well,
if
i
recall
this
--
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
we
would
like
the
court
to
listen
to
us
in
that
area
if
we
might.
we
think
there
are
strong
reasons
why
this
very
same
point
should
be
considered
and
with
your
honors
permissions,
i
would
like
to
speak
about
it
briefly.
my
recollection
of
the
gonzales
was
that
it
was
a
suit
against
the
union
by
an
employee,
that
within
the
reach
of
301
and
they
did
apply
state
law.
and
of
course
as
your
honor
mentioned
this
pre-emption
did
not
apply
but
if
you
will
recall,
i
think
the
majority
distinguished
that
on
the
basis
that
it
was
so
to
speak
on
the
periphery
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
obviously
something
that
the
board
could
not
have
acted
upon.
we're
here
at
the
heart
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
it's
always
existed
in
the
area
of
unfair
labor
practices.
this
is
not
a
peripheral
matter.
now,
it's
been
customary
--
i
shouldn't
say
customary
but
this
court
has
always
approached
pre-emption
cases
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
we
also
adopt
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
lincoln
mills
who
said
that
the
correct
approach
is
to
decide
each
case
as
it
comes
along.
we've
become
involved
in
a
great
many
hypothetical
cases
in
a
reading
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief
and
of
our
brother
harris'
brief
which
are
not
involved
here.
for
that
reason,
we
would
like
with
the
court's
permission
to
briefly
restate
the
facts
because
we
think
they
are
very
important
to
this
case.
our
issues
are
very
narrow
and
our
contentions
are
accordingly
narrow.
the
respondent
is
a
publisher
of
a
daily
and
sunday
newspaper
in
the
city
of
detroit,
michigan.
it
was
stipulated,
it
was
engaged
in
interstate
commerce,
that
the
petitioner
was
a
janitor
as
were
his
assignors.
they
belong
to
a
local
of
the
national
guild
with
whom
the
respondent
had
a
labor
contract.
we
had
14
other
contracts
with
various
trades
and
crafts
such
as
pressmen
and
the
like.
on
december
1st
of
1955,
a
strike
occurred
caused
by
a
union
other
than
the
guild
which
lasted
approximately
a
month
and
a
half.
during
this
strike,
most
of
our
organized
labor
was
laid
off
altogether
such
as
the
pressmen
stereotype
persons
and
the
like
be
unorganized
working
force
consisting
primarily
of
editorial
business
and
advertising
employees
continued
to
work
full
time.
as
petitioner
says,
and
we
must
concede
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
with
no
work
available.
the
petitioner
as
a
janitor
worked
part
time.
upon
the
resumption
of
publication,
all
crafts
and
employees
were
recalled
and
worked
from
then
on
full
time.
this
action
was
brought
for
back
pay
based
on
the
collective
agreement
and
the
breach
of
only
one
paragraph
of
that
agreement
which
i
would
like
to
refer
to.
it
appears
on
page
4
of
the
record.
there
shall
be
no
discrimination
--
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
yes,
page
4,
mr.
justice
brennan.
there
shall
be
no
discrimination
against
any
employee
because
of
his
membership
or
activity
in
the
guild.
all
parties
have
regarded
this
section
as
being
nothing
more
than
the
paraphrasing
of
the
obligations
contained
in
section
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
act.
i
think
it's
so
regarded.
to
us
it
is
no
more
than
had
the
parties
agreed
to
abide
by
section
8
(a)
(3)
by
reference
and
had
the
union
agreed
to
abide
by
section
8
(b)
of
the
act.
in
other
words,
incorporation
by
reference
and
as
mr.
--
our
brother
harris
has
made
clear
in
his
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
this
was
the
sole
basis
for
the
action.
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
was
never
filed,
either
by
the
petitioners
or
by
the
union,
or
by
anyone
on
their
behalf.
the
action
in
the
state
court
was
a
simple
--
of
some
said
action
by
the
individual
employees
based
on
breach
of
contract.
the
union
was
not
a
party.
no
relief
was
sought
on
its
behalf.
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned,
its
views
are
unknown.
it
was
commenced
after
the
six
months
period
provided
in
section
10
(a)
for
the
filing
of
charges
had
elapsed.
and
under
our
local
statute
of
limitations
could
have
been
commenced
at
anytime
within
six
years.
as
to
damages
and
i
might
at
that
point
answer,
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
it
is
not
required
to
my
knowledge
under
michigan
law
that
the
individual
sue
--
the
union
could
sue
his
assignee
and
this
jurisdiction
incidentally
at
least
in
michigan
has
existed
for
i
would
say
at
least
40
years.
there
is
a
well
developed
body
of
michigan
law
relating
to
the
rights
of
individuals
under
collective
bargaining
agreements
particularly
cortez
versus
ford
motor
which
is
a
relative
in
recent
case
and
(inaudible)
--
reviews
of
the
prior
decisions
of
the
court.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
i
believe
that
that
can
be
done
if
they
are
an
assignee.
they
cannot
do
it
in
their
own
rights
so
to
speak.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
absent
an
assignee
but
i
know
of
no
obstacle
to
their
suing
if
they
are
suing
as
an
assignee.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
exactly.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
difference
that
the
michigan
law
regards
the
employee
as
a
third
party
beneficiary.
some
states,
they
regard
it
as
principal
agent
and
so
forth.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
exactly.
because
we
have
to
conclude
the
parties,
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
the
only
way
we
can
satisfy
a
judgment
is
where
the
parties
are
actually
before
the
court.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
as
to
damages
recovery
was
sought
solely
of
back
pay
consisting
of
the
difference
between
what
this
employee
would
have
recovered
had
he
worked
full
time
and
had
he
worked
part
time.
this
is
the
identical
relief
that
he
could
have
secured
from
the
board,
had
he
gone
to
the
board.
there
is
no
difference
that
we
know
of.
and
finally
we
brought
the
motion
to
dismiss
as
our
brother
harris
has
stated
it
and
i
think
there's
one
element
of
humor
that
entered
into
this
but
which
is
illustrative
of
the
state
court's
reaction
to
these
matters.
our
pretrial
judge
who
happens
to
be
one
of
our
best
trial
judges,
this
appears
at
page
23
of
the
record.
he
said
after
reciting
the
facts,
let's
be
blunt
about
it
if
this
court
could
settle
this
controversy,
if
it
settle
with
difference
between
the
western
powers
in
russia.
i
know
when
i'm
licked.
this
simply
illustrates
the
complete
lack
of
knowledge
of
state
court
judges
in
the
area
of
unfair
labor
practices,
never
had
the
occasion
to
consider
these
things
and
confront
it
with
them
why
they
are
if
they
admit
--
whether
they
admit
it
or
not
licked.
now
we
would
like
to
consider
with
the
court
if
we
might
very
briefly
the
question
of
pre-emption
because
we
would
like
to
submit
that
that
issue
was
not
foreclosed
by
the
decisions
of
the
last
term
upon
which
my
brother
relies.
we
have
here
gentlemen
a
situation
where
this
court
is
asked
to
create
a
concurrent
and
independent
jurisdiction
over
conduct
which
is
cognizable
before
the
board
as
an
unfair
labor
practice.
it
is
said
that
this
is
different
because
it's
a
contract.
i
submit
that
this
is
a
difference
in
form
and
not
in
substance.
if
the
petitioner
is
correct
then
we
have
a
situation
where
we
have
a
raise
of
diligence
as
was
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
railway
labor
act
cases,
with
one
party
running
to
the
board
perhaps
and
another
party
running
to
the
courts.
we
have
a
situation
where
we
are
injecting
the
courts
into
an
area
totally
foreign
to
them,
where
they
will
be
asked
to
give
a
secondhand
reading
to
board
decisions.
we
are
bypassing
the
procedures
and
the
practices
which
congress
established
specifically
as
stated
in
garner
to
develop
these
peculiar
distinctive
rights
which
we
find
in
section
8
and
section
7
of
the
act.
we
find
nothing
i
submit
if
it
is
carefully
examined
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
this.
the
principle
argument
for
the
proposition
that
this
is
so
is
that
congress
and
specifically
senate
bill
1126
included
the
provision
which
would
have
made
a
breach
of
contract
and
unfair
labor
practice,
cognizable
by
the
board.
this
was
also
true
of
section
301
or
its
antecedent
i
should
say.
so
that
under
the
senate
bill
as
proposed,
we
would
have
had
two
remedies;
one
before
the
board
and
one
before
the
courts.
eventually
as
a
result
of
conference
this
was
dropped
and
as
a
house
conference
report
decided,
my
brother
harris
quoted
it.
it
chose
to
leave
the
matter
to
the
usual
processes
of
the
law.
i
think
in
this
connection
that
there
is
a
significant
statement
which
unfortunately
i've
been
trudging
through
the
legislative
history
for
a
month
or
so
now
and
i
did
not
find
at
the
time
i
wrote
my
brief
but
i
would
like
to
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
and
that
is
the
remarks
of
senator
taft
explaining
the
conference
agreement
which
to
me
is
of
equal
if
not
more
significance
than
the
house
conference
report.
he
had
this
to
say,
it
appears
in
the
congressional
record
of
the
senate,
june
5th,
1947
and
can
be
found
in
volume
2
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
government
printing
office
at
page
1539.
he
says
this
in
pertinent
part,
when
the
bill
passed
the
senate,
it
also
contained
a
sixth
paragraph
in
this
subsection,
section
8
(a)
(6)
which
made
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
violate
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
the
terms
of
an
agreement
to
submit
a
labor
dispute
to
arbitration.
the
house
conferees
objected
to
this
provision
on
the
ground
that
it
would
have
the
effect
of
making
the
terms
of
every
collective
agreement
subject
to
interpretation
and
determination
by
the
board
rather
than
the
courts.
the
senate
conferees
ultimately
agreed
to
its
elimination
as
well
as
the
deletion
of
a
similar
provision
contained
in
sec
--
subsection
8
(b)
(5)
which
governed
the
unions.
the
provisions
of
the
senate
amendment
which
conferred
the
right
of
action
for
damages
upon
a
party
aggrieved
by
a
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract
however
were
retained
in
the
conference
agreement,
that
section
301.
if
both
provisions
had
remained,
there
would
been
--
have
been
a
probably
conflict
of
remedies
and
decisions.
and
if
you
study
the
minority
report
in
the
house,
you
will
find
that
this
was
one
of
the
principal
objections
of
those
opposing
in
the
house,
this
proposal.
so
that
we
now
have
this
peculiar
situation,
the
senate
bill
would
of
course
have
been
a
part
of
the
federal
law
reviewable
by
this
court
and
any
diversities
and
conflicts
between
the
board's
interpretation
of
a
contract
and
the
court's
interpretation
of
a
contract
under
section
301
would
have
been
reviewable
by
this
court.
nonetheless,
congress
decided
that
this
was
not
right
because
of
the
possibility
of
conflict.
and
yet
in
this
case,
gentlemen,
what
this
petitioner
seeks
is
to
vest
jurisdiction
concurrently
in
the
board
under
the
guise
of
breach
of
contracts
and
we
will
have
even
though
it
is
reviewable
because
controlled
by
sub-federal
substantive
law
or
part
of
301,
we
will
have
the
same
confusion
and
conflict
and
we
will
have
it
many
times
over
because
we
will
have
the
trial
courts
throughout
the
country
state
and
federal
open
to
every
litigant
regardless
of
amount,
regardless
of
diversity
of
citizenship.
and
we
say
that
this
is
not
something
that
the
contract
or
rather
that
the
congress
considered
a
desirable
result.
now,
i
would
like
to
also
make
it
clear
that
our
contention
is
very
narrow.
we
only
seek
the
result
which
we
do
in
those
cases
where
the
collective
agreement
by
reference
paraphrase
or
what
have
you
incorporates
into
the
contract
an
unfair
labor
practice
where
the
board
can
give
relief.
we
have
no
sympathy
for
the
use
of
pre-emption
in
the
contract
action
as
a
complete
defense
to
any
liability.
we
do
not
suggest
that
our
responsibility
be
avoided.
all
we
seek
is
to
channelized
into
the
expertise
and
knowledge
of
the
board,
matters
that
are
as
clearly
an
unfair
labor
practice
as
this.
we
do
not
attempt
to
unseek
arbitration
because
we
believe
if
this
case
were
to
fall
because
this
court
felt
that
arbitration
would
be
affected
then
we
would
withdraw
because
all
of
us
who
work
in
that
labor
field
have
a
growing
respect
for
arbitration.
it
is
a
peculiar
institution,
it
is
favored
by
congress,
it
is
favored
by
the
courts,
and
more
importantly,
it
has
been
favored
by
the
board
since
its
inception.
as
the
solicitor
general
points
out
in
his
brief,
the
board
has
always
had
an
attitude
of
accommodation
towards
arbitration,
in
fact,
has
insisted
upon
it
in
many
occasions.
so
that
we
do
not
feel
that
the
reach
of
our
argument
affects
arbitration
and
of
course,
there
is
no
arbitration
present
here.
what
is
the
practical
effect?
they
say,
"no,
it
doesn't
affect
the
board's
jurisdiction
as
such."
that
is
certainly
so,
it
does
not.
but
it
encourages
every
employee
in
such
a
situation
to
bypass
the
board
and
how
can
the
board
effectuate
public
policy
if
you
provide
another
forum
and
say
to
that
employee,
“here
is
another
place
to
go.”
perhaps
they
are
more
receptive.
its
forum
shopping,
that's
what
it
is
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
and
it
substitutes
as
i
have
said
for
the
board's
expertise
and
knowledge,
a
state
court's
ignorance
and
secondhand
reading
of
the
board's
decision.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
no
sir,
they
had
not.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
exactly.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
i
do
not
but
i
can
speculate
that
the
--
one
grounds
we're
going
to
the
state
court
was
that
they
thought
that
it
was
more
receptive
than
the
board
at
that
time.
perhaps
they
feel
differently
now
but
the
point
is
that
--
that
this
isn't
an
opportunity
for
forum
shopping.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court
we
were
discussing
pre-emption
and
i
had
about
concluded
my
remarks
on
the
practical
effect
of
the
petitioner's
position
it
adopted.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
so
that
there
will
be
no
misunderstanding
that
in
our
opinion,
we
have
here
a
parallel
remedy
and
a
parallel
right
to
appear
before
the
court
and
before
the
board
and
that
the
relief
would
have
been
the
same.
in
other
words,
if
the
petitioner
could
have
gone
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
it
is
conceded
that
he
would've
secured
the
same
relief
instead
he
waited
beyond
the
statutory
period
before
going
to
--
before
commencing
his
lawsuit
and
he
never
did
go
to
the
board.
now,
i
would
like
to
discuss
very
briefly
dowd
box
and
lucas
flour.
it
is
the
petitioner's
argument
that
dowd
box
considered
this
exact
situation
such
as
most
certainly
not
the
case
if
one
reads
the
briefs
and
considers
the
argument
of
mr.
feller
at
the
last
term
in
dowd
box.
that
was
a
true
collective
right
that
was
being
enforced
by
the
union.
in
fact,
it
involved
the
entire
validity
of
the
agreement
which
the
company
claimed
was
void
by
a
reason
of
lack
of
authority
in
the
negotiators.
and,
naturally
the
union
was
--
had
a
perfect
right
under
301
to
assert
the
contract's
validity.
there
followed
a
wage
increase
which
had
been
included
in
the
contract
as
negotiated,
and
there
was
a
relief
given
as
to
that
but
that
was
an
incidental
part
of
the
suit.
the
suit
was
for
enforcement.
the
alleged
unfair
labor
practice
was
a
refusal
to
bargain
and
we
know
from
the
insurance
agents
case
that
the
board
is
in
no
position
whatsoever
to
grant
the
same
relief
as
the
court
using
its
equity
powers
in
massachusetts
which
was
done
in
dowd
box.
so
that
--
and
another
thing,
there
was
no
disagreement
in
that
case
about
pre-emption.
if
you
will
read
the
petitioner's
brief
again,
you
will
find
that
the
petitioner
claimed
that
pre-emption
did
not
apply
to
a
301
action.
he
agreed
with
mr.
feller.
what
he
did
say
was
that
it
applied
solely
on
the
federal
court
because
301
confined
jurisdiction
exclusively
to
the
federal
courts
so
that
the
pre-emption
wasn't
argued
either.
as
to
lucas
flour
we
had
no
unfair
labor
practice
at
all.
it
was
a
claim
--
the
claim
of
the
union
in
that
case
as
a
means
avoiding
liability
altogether
that
the
right
to
strike
was
arguably
protected.
there
is
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
it
was
arguably
prohibited.
i
don't
quite
understand
that
and
i
don't
think
mr.
oles
who
argued
for
lucas
flour
in
that
case
understood
it
either.
but
in
any
event,
the
pre-emption
rule
as
claimed
by
the
respective
parties
in
dowd
box
and
lucas
flour
is
not
our
case
because
in
those
cases
most
certainly
the
board
was
not
in
a
position
to
grant
relief
and
couldn't
have
granted
relief.
and
before
leaving,
well
i
should
say
i've
one
other
remark
to
make
and
that
is
that
this
contract
argument
is
deceptively
simple.
in
our
case,
the
government
brief
says
that
pre-emption
should
not
apply
to
a
contract
action.
our
brother
harris
admits
that
this
is
not
so
if
substantive
state
law
controls.
the
government,
through
the
solicitor
general,
has
several
reservations
about
this.
he
says
this
is
right
in
this
case
but
it
is
wrong
as
he
says
in
his
footnote
at
page
25
--
rather
in
his
footnote
at
page
17.
it
is
wrong
if
the
contract
includes
a
sweeping
--
i
think,
to
use
his
exact
words
--
no,
he
uses
this.
he
says
if
the
bargaining
agreement
merely
adopted
as
such
a
wide
range
of
obligations
imposed
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
imposed
statutory
duty
to
bargain
collectively
and
so
forth,
then
this
would
be
a
different
case.
this
is
a
different
case
and
degree
but
i
submit
to
the
court
that
it's
no
valid
distinction
because
section
8
(a)
(3)
equally
requires
the
expertise
and
knowledge
of
the
board
as
if
you
included
in
section
7,
section
8,
and
the
duty
to
bargain
collectively,
etcetera.
and
in
section
20
--
i
mean
on
page
25
in
his
footnote,
he
refers
to
another
exception
and
these
are
cases
in
which
the
board
has
appeared
and
the
claim
is
a
contract
claim.
it
involves
recognition,
a
standard
part
of
every
contract
which
says
that
the
union
is
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent
but
suddenly
the
union
loses
the
majority
of
the
employees
who's
--
choose
to
be
represented
by
another
employer
and
the
--
or
rather
another
union
and
then
the
union
who's
been
unseated
brings
an
action
in
court
on
301
to
enforce
the
agreement.
the
solicitor
general
says
that
here
he
feels
that
there
ought
to
be
determined
by
the
courts
to
the
expertise
and
knowledge
of
the
board.
i
agree
--
oh,
i
think
all
we
disagree
on
is
whether
or
not
we
ought
not
to
defer
to
the
expertise
and
knowledge
of
the
board
in
this
area
where
the
contract
incorporates
section
8
(a)
(3).
to
us
it's
equally
important.
now,
as
a
selectee
--
as
a
suggested
solution
and
one
supported
by
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
the
railway
labor
act
cases
and
by
anson
versus
hiram
walker
cited
in
our
brief
which
was
a
decision
by
the
seventh
circuit
denied
review
by
this
court,
we
feel
that
it
should
be
required
of
an
individual
employee
with
a
remedy
before
the
board
to
go
to
the
board
first
and
that
if
the
court
is
approached
on
the
same
theory
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
that
the
court
insist
that
he
go
to
the
board
first.
if
the
board
refuses
to
take
jurisdiction
or
will
not
issue
a
complaint,
then
he's
in
the
position
to
go
back
to
the
court.
if
the
board
on
the
other
hand
takes
jurisdiction
as
it
most
certainly
would
have
in
this
case
i
think,
then
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
and
this
is
suggested
in
the
railway
labor
act
cases
such
as
slocum
versus
delaware
and
order
of
railway
conductors
in
339
u.s.
where
the
courts
were
denied
the
right
to
act
where
the
employee
had
not,
where
the
union
had
not
gone
to
the
railway
adjustment
board
to
seek
relief.
they
insisted
--
it
was
insisted
by
this
court
in
those
cases
that
that
be
followed.
otherwise,
this
raise
of
diligence
would
follow
and
there'd
be
a
result
in
conflict
at
least
potentially.
and
with
that
i
would
like
to
pass
to
the
question
of
section
301.
as
we
see
it,
our
argument
is
--
maybe
summarized
in
this
manner.
we
think
that
section
301
is
the
basis
for
this
federal
labor
law
which
the
court
enunciated
in
lincoln
mills
that
this
section
grants
rights,
federal
rights
so
to
speak
from
which
this
court
is
free
to
fashion
a
federal
law.
the
question
is
what
are
these
rights
and
what
is
the
reach
of
this
statute?
and
does
it
apply
to
a
suit
by
an
individual
employee
for
back
pay?
and
if
it
does
not,
what
is
the
applicable
substantive
law,
state
or
federal.
and
so
i
think
in
our
quest
for
an
answer,
we
start
with
westinghouse.
westinghouse
of
course
was
by
--
there
was
no
majority
opinion
in
westinghouse
but
the
feeling
i
think
of
those
in
the
majority
was
that
these
were
uniquely
personal
or
individual
rights
and
that
congress
did
not
contemplate
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
301,
a
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
courts
over
suits
by
individual
employees.
this
has
a
sound
legislative
basis
because
we
find
consistent
references
to
the
flood
of
litigation
which
would
result,
the
fact
that
federal
judiciary
was
then
vastly
overburdened
and
still
is.
and
furthermore
we
find
only
two
references.
at
least,
i
have
only
been
able
to
find
two
references
to
individual
employee
actions
in
the
entire
legislative
history
of
section
301
and
the
taft-hartley
act.
one
is
--
was
referred
to
my
--
by
my
brother
harris
a
question
by
representative
barden
answered
by
representative
hartley.
this
is
the
only
one
of
significance.
it
appears
in
lincoln
mills.
it
doesn't
seem
to
have
any
particular
significance.
it's
a
long
question
perhaps
misunderstood.
the
other
was
a
remark
by
senator
taft
in
which
he,
referring
to
section
301
said
that
it
granted
rights
to
the
employers
and
the
employees.
he
obviously
misspoke
himself.
he
meant
the
union
not
the
employees
because
he
didn't
even
mentioned
a
labor
organization
or
the
union.
westinghouse
established
this
proposition.
westinghouse
is
no
longer
law
as
to
the
constitutional
questions
which
bothered
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
lincoln
mills
settled
that.
but
if
we
have
westinghouse
in
(inaudible)
of
history
by
reason
of
lincoln
mills
then
i
failed
to
see
why
this
court
was
so
careful
to
distinguish
westinghouse
as
it
did
in
lincoln
mills.
and
mr.
justice
harlan,
joining
in
the
occurring
opinion
made
it
plain
that
his
concurrence
was
on
the
basis
that
lincoln
mills
involved
the
enforcement
of
a
collective
right
and
not
a
uniquely
personal
right.
so
that
was
--
to
me
at
least
the
status
of
westinghouse
and
how
was
it
--
as
it
appeared
to
the
lower
courts
since.
i
have
reviewed
the
lower
court
decisions
and
of
our
ten
circuits
plus
the
district
of
columbia,
there
have
been
--
this
question
has
been
raised
in
nine
out
of
11,
in
nine
out
of
11
cases
have
followed
westinghouse
and
said
that
an
individual
has
no
right
to
sue
under
section
301.
this
incidentally
was
a
situation
in
the
case
heard
by
this
court
at
the
last
terms,
zdanok
versus
glidden
from
the
second
circuit,
a
suit
by
individual
employees
and
considered
to
be
without
the
purview
of
section
301.
every
court
has
consistently
said
in
these
cases
that
they
were
dependent
upon
diversity
and
necessary
jurisdictional
amount.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
definitely.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
that
was
the
case
in
dowd
box.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
i
think
that
the
massachusetts
law
required
--
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
--
the
individuals
sue
on
behalf
of
the
union
--
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
--
under
their
local
procedures.
well,
contrary
definitely
a
state
procedure
could
not
block
enforcement
of
301
rights.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
yes,
i
am,
and
i'm
talking
about
the
reaction
of
the
lower
courts,
federal
courts
that
have
treated
the
question
since
westinghouse.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
well,
we
have
--
we
have
four
cases
decided
may
and
june
of
this
year.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
there
was
detroit
edison
versus
palno.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
i
think
that
is
cited
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor,
mr.
justice
stewart.
there's
another
sixth
circuit
case
which
i'm
sure
is
cited
in
my
brief,
general
drivers
union
versus
riss,
there
--
those
were
both
sixth
circuit
cases.
we
also
have
the
case
of
sheppard
versus
cornelia
--
cornelius
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
i
believe
so
sir
and
that
was
decided
in
302
f.2d.
i
think
its
june,
may
or
june
of
this
year.
so
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
many
of
these
courts
of
appeal
seem
to
have
some
little
difficulty
with
a
question
that
they
decide
the
case
is
per
curiam.
i
mean
there's
no
extended
consideration
--
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
(inaudible)
--
i
choose
--
think
it
was
a
simple
matter
and
maybe
--
but
at
least
the
sixth
circuit
has
done
it
per
curiam
and
perhaps
because
of
the
difficulty.
in
any
event
that's
been
the
status
of
the
matter
in
the
local
courts
so
that
i
can't
conclude
the
dowd
box
or
rather
the
westinghouse
has
yet
in
the
dustbin
of
history.
now
we
come
to
dowd
back
--
box
and
that
puts
it
in
the
dustbin
of
history.
that
puts
it
in
the
dustbin
of
history
only
if
dowd
box
involved
uniquely
personal
rights
alone
which
it
didn't.
it
did
at
the
end
because
the
other
questions
have
become
moot
as
i
recall
it.
but
as
initiated
in
the
massachusetts
court,
it
was
a
collective
right
that
the
union
claimed
to
enforce
just
as
much
as
the
right
to
arbitrate.
and
of
course,
in
lincoln
mills
we
wound
up
with
an
arbitration
concerning
back
pay.
but
the
assertion
of
the
federal
right
which
congress
found
a
desirable
method
in
which
lincoln
mills
decided
was
a
right
considered
by
congress
within
the
meaning
of
section
301
and
equally
with
dowd
box.
now
coming
to
atkinson,
i
must
confess
at
more
difficulty
with
atkinson
for
the
simple
reason
that
it's
premised
on
two
grounds.
i
think
that
the
majority
through
mr.
justice
white
in
discussing
count
2
of
atkinson
where
the
jurisdiction
was
based
on
diversity
said
it
was
sufficient
if
the
complaint
on
its
face
showed
an
alleged
violation
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
but
mr.
justice
white
then
went
on
to
consider
the
second
ground.
and
the
second
ground
involves
the
only
substantive
law
to
be
found
in
section
301
in
its
entirety.
and
that
is
the
vicarious
responsibility
of
the
union
and
the
exculpation
of
the
union
member
from
liability
to
the
--
end
that,
there
would
be
no
repetition
of
the
danbury
hatter
situation.
congress
was
unanimous
in
this
view
both
majority
and
minority.
they
wanted
to
end
any
possibility
of
a
union
member
being
liable.
and
in
atkinson,
count
2,
as
mr.
justice
white's
opinion
states
charged
these
members
with
liability
for
breach
of
the
no-strike
clause
even
though
they
were
acting
as
agents
of
the
union.
and
to
us
at
least
this
is
controlled
by
section
301
(b)
in
a
substantive
law
there.
we
were
there
involved
with
the
suit
against
the
union
member
individually.
here,
we
are
considering
a
suit
by
an
individual
member
which
we
think
is
considerably
difficult.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
according
to
my
theory,
mr.
justice
white,
which
i
think
professors
--
professor
cox
went
--
subscribed
to,
there
is
a
uniquely
personal
right
involved
for
the
individual
suits
for
back
pay.
after
all
he
earned
it,
it's
his,
the
title
to
it
is
his,
the
union
has
no
interest
in
it.he
is
the
only
that
can
assert
--
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
in
that
case,
we
say
that
pre-emption
should
apply
firstly.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
then
we
have
what
the
solicitor
general
terms
or
has
termed
in
a
law
review
article,
a
provision
with
a
dual
aspect
because
the
union
has
an
interest
in
it
but
so
does
the
individual.
but
i
submit
to
the
court
that
if
the
union
were
to
sue,
its
cause
of
action
would
be
entirely
different
except
as
to
the
issue
perhaps
of
discrimination.
because
the
union,
i
would
assume,
would
be
claiming
that
it
was
damaged
because
its
membership
was
in
fact
discouraged,
it
lost
dues,
etcetera.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
well,
anyone
as
i
understand
it
can
file
a
charge
before
the
board
and
so
the
union
could.but
the
board
would
be
considering
the
section
7
and
8
rights
of
the
employees.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
yes,
but
i
say
totally
different.
mr.
philip
t.
van
zile,
ii
i
certainly
do
because
i
think
when
back
pay
is
involved
as
there
was
in
westinghouse,
it
doesn't
make
much
difference
what
caused
the
contract
is
involved.
this
is
an
accrued
right.
this
is
now
several
years
old,
closed,
the
wages
are
--
the
right
to
the
wages,
if
there
is
one,
are
vested
and
they're
in
the
employed.
the
lower
courts
at
least
have
so
observed.
but
i'm
most
frank
to
admit
that
it
does
have
a
dual
aspect.
now,
i
would
also
like
to
mention
that
congress
as
i
think
many
have
observed
considered
only
collective
rights
and
for
that
matter,
as
lincoln
mills
--
the
briefs
in
lincoln
mills
may
claim,
the
main
thing
that
they
consider
was
the
no-strike
clause.
and
they
also
considered
arbitration
rights.
in
considering
the
breach
of
contract,
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
they
considered
these
collective
rights.
they
--
at
no
point
except
these
two
references
that
i
have
noted
referred
to
individual
rights.
and
in
fact,
the
contrary
it
was
noted
i
think
by
secretary
schwanbach
(ph)
testifying
before
the
committee
that
individuals
had
always
been
able
to
sue
and
of
course,
congress
at
that
point
was
concerned
with
the
suability
of
unions
as
an
entity.
this
was
a
problem
with
them.
there
was
of
course
no
problem
with
the
suit
by
an
individual,
nor
has
there
ever
been
to
my
knowledge
in
the
state
such
a
problem
on
one
theory
or
another,
be
a
third
party
beneficiary
what
have
you
traditionally.
individual
rights
have
been
enforceable
whether
it's
for
seniority
or
what
have
you.
so
that
there
was
no
necessity
felt,
i
would
assume
by
congress
for
dealing
with
these
rights
or
trying
to
affect
these
rights.
instead
they
left
as
they
said,
the
house
conference
report
said
in
rejecting
the
senate
amendment
on
breach
of
contract
as
an
unfair
labor
practice,
we
leave
this
to
the
usual
processes
of
the
law.
well,
these
processes
become
--
i
submit
respectfully
quite
unusual
if
petitioner's
argument
is
acceptable
because
they're
going
to
have
displaced.
in
michigan
i
know
our
entire
substantive
body
of
law
developed
over
40
or
50
years
in
the
sense
that
it
will
only
exist
if
it
is
compatible
with
this
so-called
federal
common
law.so
that
we
do
have
a
problem
in
federalism,
we
lack
any
clear
intent
from
the
congressional
history
or
the
legislation
indicating
that
congress
intended
to
usurp
the
states
in
the
exercise
of
these
rights.
and
i
become
frankly
quite
lost
in
this
area
in
many
respects.
because
normally,
i
think
of
legislation,
federal
legislation
as
creating
rights
in
the
sense
of
a
statute
to
which
you
can
look.
this
is
not
so
here.
we
do
know
however
that
the
federal
rights
created
under
section
301
which
we
construed
to
be
the
right
of
the
union
or
the
employer
to
sue
for
breach
of
agreement,
does
give
the
court's
power
to
fashion
a
federal
law.
but
we
say
that
it
is
--
that
the
scope
of
this
law
is
limited
to
the
jurisdictional
scope
of
section
301
because
that's
where
the
federal
laws
came
from
so
to
speak
from
these
federal
rights.
and
to
indicate
why
we
feel
difficulty
in
this
area,
we
compare
new
york
central
versus
winfield
with
the
situation
here.
that
case
involved
the
reach
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act.
and
in
that
case,
congress
directed
the
code
of
regulation
though
it's
comprehensive
and
it
was
based
on
negligence.
the
new
york
legislature
passed
the
workmen's
compensation
act
which
did
not
require
a
showing
of
negligence.
and
in
that
case,
the
question
was
whether
or
not
a
railroad
employee
could
sue
under
the
employer's
lia
--
could
sue
or
recover
under
the
workmen's
compensation
act
being
covered
by
the
employer's
liability
act.
the
answer
of
the
court
was
no
but
when
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
federal
employer's
liability
act
as
mr.
justice
bender
said,
you
find
that
the
legislator
--
legislature
that
congress
considered
this
very
point
and
rejected
the
idea
of
imposing
liability
without
negligence.
and
even
then
mr.
justice
brandeis
despite
this
legislative
history
would
have
permitted
the
new
york
courts
to
apply
the
workmen's
compensation
law
because
it
was
not
in
conflict.
here,
by
virtue
of
this
federal
law,
common
law,
the
breadth
of
which
we
do
not
know
and
have
no
idea
of,
we
have
now
displaced
all
law
in
the
area
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
industries
affecting
commerce.
and
they
maybe
utilized,
that
is
the
state
decisions
maybe
utilized
only
as
they
are
consistent
with
federal
decisions
so.
as
a
practitioner,
we
are
left
without
guidelines
or
means
of
determining
what
law
applies.
that
is
exactly
petitioner's
position
as
to
the
reach
of
the
law.
on
the
contrary
on
the
railway
labor
act
which
some
people
have
said
as
a
state
--
within
the
state
and
subject
to
the
breath
of
legislation
contained
in
the
railway
labor
act,
this
court
didn't
reach
this
conclusion
because
in
moore
and
kopel.
the
cases
where
the
employees
were
discharged
what
law
applied
there?
it
was
state
law
said
this
court.
in
the
case
of
moore
it
was
a
state
statute
limitation
and
in
kopel
it
was
the
state
rule
regarding
exhaustion
of
internal
remedies.
and
i
submit
that
the
railway
labor
act
proposes
this
comprehensive
regulation
as
does
the
national
labor
relations
act
with
regard
to
collective
agreements.
and
going
through
the
entire
history
of
--
not
the
entire
history
but
many
of
the
cases
which
have
considered
whether
or
not
state
law
applies
under
various
(inaudible)
types
of
federal
legislation,
i
found
no
instance
where
the
court
has
displaced
state
law
unless
there
is
a
comprehensive
regulation
and
a
probability
of
conflict
not
just
a
possibility
of
conflict.
so
we
submit
to
the
court
that
whether
this
be
an
action
based
on
section
301
or
not
and
whether
or
not
the
federal
substantive
law
applies
that
nonetheless
if
there's
to
be
centralized
coherent
administration
of
the
act
and
not
duplicate
remedies,
forum
shopping
and
the
like
that
this
court
will
following
--
the
reasoning
of
other
situations
require
an
individual
employer
to
resort
the
board
first
and
the
court
to
defer
to
the
board
where
its
expertise
and
knowledge
is
evaluated
in
this
situation.
and
we
will
ask
--
we
respectfully
suggest
that
this
is
the
best
remedy
for
obtaining
centralized
administration
of
title
1
of
the
act.
we
also
--
and
if
this
would
be
so
if
we
are
right
in
this
contention,
then
there's
no
necessity
for
considering
the
reach
of
federal
law
under
section
301.
on
the
other
hand,
if
in
the
court's
opinion
pre-emption
does
not
apply
in
a
section
301
action,
then
the
reach
of
section
301
becomes
important
because
as
my
brother
harris
agrees
i
believe,
if
substantive
law
does
not
control,
that
is
federal
substantive
law
does
not
control
this
action
then
pre-emption
does
apply
even
though
it
is
a
contract
action.
thank
you.
