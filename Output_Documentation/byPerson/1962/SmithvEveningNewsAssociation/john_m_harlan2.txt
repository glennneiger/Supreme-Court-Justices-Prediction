justice
john
m.
harlan
everything
you
said
so
far
sums
that
this
action
is
maintainable
under
301,
is
that
correct?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
mean
today,
i
was
going
to
ask
you
that
as
the
next
question.
is
it
--
is
that
the
controlling
issue
in
this
case
as
you
see
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
we
can
come
to
that
next
point
then.
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
which
--
up
to
date,
you're
really
--
are
you
suggesting
that
the
westinghouse
is
--
has
been
overruled
or
should
be
overruled?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
it
has
been?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)see
if
i
understand,
you
say
if
state
law
controls
and
you
concede
that
there
is
pre-emption.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'm
surprise
to
hear
you
make
that
concession
so
readily,
that's
the
reason
i
asked.
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
this
really
does
come
back
as
far
as
your
case
is
concerned
to
standing
or
falling
on
whether
301
covers
this
action.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
because
section
301
governed
the
action.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
isn't
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
that
was
crystal
clear.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
neither
of
you
refers
to
the
gonzales
case.
but
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
dissenting
opinion,
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
holding
of
the
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
--
that
was
a
case
that
was
governed
by
state
law
and
where
pre-emption
notwithstanding
was
not
held
applicable.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
you
say
--
what
you
need
to
do
with
that
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
case
is
very
easily
disposed
obviously
if
301
governs
this
case
--
governs
this
cause
of
action.
