justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
general,
is
it
correct
to
say
that
the
cases
here
because
panagra
has
been
unable
to
pursue
an
application
before
the
cab
and
before
the
president
because
pan
american's
50%
interest
prevented
a
proceeding
to
proceed
before
the
cab?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
solicitor
general,
at
the
time
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
general
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
solicitor
general,
the
court
ordered
them
to
divest
and
with
usual
language
in
the
decree,
this
character,
could
they
file
an
application
before
the
cab
without
going
back
to
the
court
in
saying
circumstances
have
changed
and
you
would
like
to
(voice

--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
then
having
divested,
could
they
reacquire
in
any
way
without
getting
the
court
to
say
that
they
had
a
right
to
do
it?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so
that
if
we
order
--
if
we
order
--
sustain
the
order
and
use
justice
black's
illustration,
then
in
effect
and
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
to
administer.
then
in
effect,
this
court
would
say
to
the
district
court
that
the
time
is
now
right
for
you
to
make
another
application,
would
that
be
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
judge,
may
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
but
did
not
the
government
charge
this
as
one
of
the
elements
in
the
government's
complaint?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
about
the
complaint
that
the
government
(voice

--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
substantive
allegation
of
the
complaint?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
did
they
charge
the
section
2
violation
in
the
complaint?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
i
--
i
was
reading
the
statement
from
it
and
one
of
the
statements
was
that
pan
american
use
this
50%
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
full
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
to
prevent
panagra
from
securing
authorities
from
the
civil
aeronautics
board.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
would
get
the
business
that
having
from
the
west
coast
but
not
the
east
coast
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
why
do
you
come
to
that
conclusion?
i
follow
you
--
i
follow
you
on
the
through
flights,
if
someone
starts
on
the
west
coast
you
might
want
to
continue
(voice

--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
more
than
pan
american
would
with
its
big
east
coast
traffic?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
before
you
leave,
you
refer
to
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
the
second
circuit,
and
in
fact
said,
that
the
injunction
would
be
adequate
under
the
antitrust
laws
because
under
that
opinion,
that
could
have
been
achieved
through
the
cab.
but
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
in
concluding
its
opinion
in
that
case,
say
in
effect
that
was
not
disposing
to
the
antitrust
issues
even
by
permitting
this
to
be
done.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
wasn't
the
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so
that
even
the
proceeding
that
they
have
permitted
would
not
have
affect
through
the
antitrust
(voice

--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
mckay,
you
speak
about
illegal
agreement
of
the
illegal
agreement
why
this
pan
american
to
be
divested
of
its
part
of
panagra?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
how
do
you
make
that
argument?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well
couldn't
that
be
solved
by
an
order
of
the
cab
which
presumably
was
available
in
the
second
circuit
decision
case
now
to
get
your
route
extended,
why
does
it
require
a
divestiture
of
pan
american
of
its
interest
in
panagra?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
will
you
preclude
it
from
going
back
to
the
cab
in
any
way
after
1946,
where
it
precluded
by
the
agreement
you
made
on
the
through
route?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
then
what
prevented
you
from
going
before
the
cab?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
in
other
words,
there
are
proceedings
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
before
the
cab
but
the
cab
has
not
proceeded
with
them,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
