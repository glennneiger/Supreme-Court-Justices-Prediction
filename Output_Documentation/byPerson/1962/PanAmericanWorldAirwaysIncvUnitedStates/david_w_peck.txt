mr.
david
w.
peck
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
to
get
true
insight
into
and
perspective
on
this
case.
one
has
to
relate
the
complaint,
the
course
of
the
trial
and
the
result
reached
by
the
decree
rendered.
first,
the
complaint.
this
complaint,
not
only
in
essence
but
its
in
entirety,
was
a
claim
that
the
two
defendants
were
engaged
in
an
illegal
combination
to
restrain
and
monopolize
trade.
while
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
was
mentioned,
it
is
perfectly
clear
in
the
government's
briefs
here,
make
it
clear,
that
basically
fundamentally
to
use
the
words
of
the
solicitor
general
and
i
say
entirely,
this
is
a
section
1
and
3
combination
case
as
set
forth
in
the
complaint
and
that's
all
the
government's
case
ever
was
and
as
i
read
the
government's
brief,
all
the
government's
case
is
today.
and
that
naturally
follows
from
what
the
solicitor
general
has
told
the
court,
as
to
how
this
proceeding
started.
it
started
at
the
request
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
who
ordered
to
divest
both
of
these
owners,
at
the
same
time
and
equally.
and
not
only
that,
but
in
furtherance
of
a
program
that
the
cab
had
in
response
to
its
responsibility
for
formulating
the
air
pattern
of
american
flag
carriers
and
that
was
pursuant
to
a
declaration
of
policy,
going
back
many
years
and
reiterated
as
recently
as
last
year,
that
the
traffic
in
the
south
america
is
too
thin
to
support
more
than
two
american
flag
carriers.
and
therefore,
the
most
fundamental
preset
of
the
cab
in
this
area
of
its
jurisdiction
is
to
say
that
there
must
be
only
two
american
flag
carriers.
there
must
not
be
three
because
to
quote
the
cab,
to
have
more
than
two
would
be
either
a
waste
of
public
funds
or
private
investment.
and
therefore
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
no,
i
think
--
let
me
get
that
straight
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
cab
has
always
considered
that
since
granting
a
certificate
to
braniff
in
1946,
that
there
are
only
two
american
flag
carriers
in
the
south
america.
because
to
quote
the
cab
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
--
they
have
always
regarded
panagra
as
a
part
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
--
of
the
pan
american
system.
and
therefore
their
program
was,
that
when
these
two
owners
were
divested
as
the
cab
hoped
they
would
be,
that
the
purchaser
of
the
stock,
and
they
would
have
considerable
leverage
in
that
matter,
should
be
braniff,
the
other
airline
carrier
into
south
america
so
that
then
what
you
would
have
would
be
one
airline
braniff
pretty
much
going
down
one
side,
one
airline
pan
american
pretty
much
going
down
the
other.
and
then
there
might
be
any
adjustments
of
routes
that
the
cab
desired
in
between
but
there
would
be
only
two
carriers.
now,
there
has
been
no
suggestion,
not
a
suggestion
in
this
complaint,
not
a
suggestion
by
the
government
at
the
trial
and
i
still
do
not
find
any
suggestion
from
the
government,
that
there
has
been
any
unilateral
restraint
by
pan
american
alone
in
violation
of
section
2
independently
standing
by
itself.
or
any
desire
upon
anybody's
part
at
any
time,
the
cab
or
the
government,
even
now,
that
pan
american
alone
should
be
divested.
now,
the
course
of
this
case
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
that's
what
the
district
court
did.
mr.
david
w.
peck
and
i
--
my
second
point
after
i
cover
why
the
district
court
was
right
in
the
first
part
of
its
decision,
is
why
it
was
all
wrong
in
the
second
part
of
its
decision.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
do
not
take
it
that
that
was
the
government
theory.
i
can't
find
anything
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
--
anything
of
that
kind
in
the
complaint.
mr.
david
w.
peck
it
was
grace's
theory.
i
come
now
to
the
course
of
the
trial.what
happened
at
the
trial?
the
court
permitted
grace
to
assume
the
role
of
a
private
plaintiff
of
its
own
right
in
this
government
antitrust
suit
and
allowed
grace
to
bring
into
the
case
the
argument
that
the
only
violation
here
was
a
unilateral
violation
by
pan
american
alone.
and
the
way
the
court
regarded
this
case
can
be
noted
from
its
opening
sentence,
very
significant,
i
submit.
the
court
said
this
is
only
nominally
an
antitrust
case.
actually,
the
court
said,
this
is
a
better
family
court.
and
then
the
court
proceeded
to
make
the
major
of
what
i
think
is
its
many
errors
here,
of
treating
this
case
really
as
if
it
were
a
divorce
proceeding
brought
by
grace
against
pan
american
and
the
issue
is
the
custody
of
their
child,
panagra.
and
of
what
resulted?
a
finding
that
there
has
been
no
illegal
combination
here
that
the
formation
of
panagra,
its
organization,
its
joint
ownership,
that
everything
that
these
two
defendants
did
jointly
was
perfectly
alright.
but
in
one
single
respect,
when
it
came
to
exercising
what
the
government
acknowledges
to
be,
the
exercise
of
the
normal
incidence
of
ownership
of
pan
american's
50%
ownership
of
the
stock
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
joint
venture
should
be
extended
to
the
united
states.
in
voting
though,
that
pan
american
was
cast
in
the
role
of
a
unilateral
section
2
violation.
now,
i
submit
that
this
is
not
only
grossly
unfair
to
pan
american
as
i
shall
develop
at
the
end
of
my
argument,
but
more
significant,
an
absolute
and
complete
defeat
of
national
policy
in
air
transportation,
international
air
transportation,
as
declared
by
the
cab,
the
agency
of
the
government
with
a
responsibility
for
that
air
pact.
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
david
w.
peck
the
government,
i
will
hope
from
their
brief,
they
say
that
what
pan
american
did
in
respect
to
this
route
extension
supported
in
part,
that's
the
language
of
their
brief,
supported
in
part
the
illegal
combination.
evidentiary,
i
take
it
really
evidentiary.
mr.
david
w.
peck
the
complaint
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
there
--
i
again
regard
it
as
evidentiary.
i
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
but
only
in
the
combination.
i'm
sure
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
when
you
read
that
complaint,
you'll
agree
with
me
completely.
mr.
david
w.
peck
that's
right.
mr.
david
w.
peck
that's
right.
mr.
david
w.
peck
what
they
say
is
supporting
in
part
this
whole
illegal
combination
but
they
say
it
all
stems
from
the
illegality
of
the
combination
in
the
setup
in
the
beginning
of
this
joint
ownership
and
joint
organization.
now
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
it
became
such
beginning
about
the
year
1938
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes.
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes.
may
i
--
and
i'm
going
to
develop
that
fully.
i
just
like
to
complete
this
one
point
that
the
result
here
is
a
decree
which
makes
panagra
the
very
thing
that
the
cab
says,
we
must
not
have.
if
this
decree
stands,
there
will
be
pan
american,
there
will
braniff
and
there
will
be
panagra
as
a
third
independent
air
carrier
in
the
south
america.
so
we
have
ended
up
after
all
what
the
result
which
is
the
very
antithesis
of
what
the
responsible
agency
of
the
government
says
we
must
have
and
this
result,
if
it
pleases
the
court,
is
only
symptomatic
and
illustrative
of
the
basic
usurpation
here
by
the
court
of
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
in
entertaining
this
case
to
begin
with.
and
particularly
after
the
district
court
came
to
the
conclusion
that
what
the
cab
had
asked
him
to
do
should
not
be
done
that
they
both
should
not
be
divested
in
order
that
the
cab
could
carry
out
its
program.
after
the
court
came
to
that
conclusion,
then
certainly,
it
should
not
have
gone
on
with
a
case
which
is
essentially
a
route
matter
and
fall
squarely
within
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
grace
versus
the
civil
aeronautics
board
referred
to
at
some
length
in
our
briefs,
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
very
subject
of
whether
or
not
panagra
should
be
extended
to
the
united
states,
and
whether
or
not
pan
american
was
justified
in
voting
its
stock
the
way
it
did
on
that
subject,
was
a
matter
within
the
special
expertise
and
responsibility
of
the
cab
not
merely
primary
but
exclusive
according
to
what
this
court
of
appeals
specifically
said
in
that
case.
now,
i'm
going
to
come
to
the
formation
of
panagra,
very
briefly
the
conditions
at
the
time.
the
solicitor
general
speaks
about
the
joinder
at
this
time
of
a
dominant
air
carrier
and
the
dominant
steamship
carrier.
now,
i
will
concede
that
grace
was
the
dominant
steamship
carrier
at
that
time
and
since
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
there
was
at
that
time,
mr.
justice
white,
no
american
airline
industry
in
south
america
at
all.
mr.
david
w.
peck
on
the
--
oh
yes,
yes,
yes.
on
the
west
coast,
quite,
quite.
these
two
parties
were
coming
together
in
the
most
pioneering
of
pioneering
venture.
there
was
no
industry.
they
were
starting
an
entirely
new
field
to
talk
about
this
in
the
terms
of
a
joinder
of
competitors
in
some
kind
of
a
combination
to
restrain
trade
is
just
as
far
from
the
reality
as
you
could
get.
this
was
a
joinder
of
people
to
create
something.
and
they
had
a
third
partner
in
it,
they
weren't
the
only
partners.
the
united
states
government
was
the
third
partner
because
to
use
the
phrase
appropriate
to
the
airline
industry,
this
company
couldn't
have
gotten
off
the
ground
if
the
government
hadn't
come
along
with
a
mail
contract
issued
by
the
post
office
department
which
paid
their
expenses,
their
revenues
for
years
worth
didn't
amount
to
a
quarter
of
what
it
cost
to
operate
this
airline.
and
consequently,
as
the
district
court
found,
this
was
a
three-way
operation
of
the
government
as
much
as
them.
and
then
the
question
why
pan
american
and
grace
here,
why
pan
american
is
perfectly
obvious,
pan
american
was
an
airline,
a
beginning
airline
as
the
district
court
found,
it
had
plans
to
have
an
air
system
throughout
all
of
latin
america.
it
projected
an
airline
down
the
east
coast.
it
had
already
established
one
from
the
united
states
to
the
canal
zone
and
had
a
mail
contract
for
that.
it
was
going
down
the
west
coast
of
south
america,
and
the
only
thing
that
happened,
and
of
course
i
think
this
probably
turned
up
to
be
its
mistake
in
hindsight.
but
the
only
thing
that
happened
is
that
instead
of
doing
it
alone
as
they
originally
intended
to
do
on
the
west
coast
of
south
america,
it
joined
with
grace.
and
the
reason
grace,
because
in
this
difficult
situation
of
getting
this
new
industry
started,
grace
had
business
houses
all
along
the
west
coast
of
south
america,
steamship
lines
for
rescue
operations
and
the
like,
and
they
made
as
the
court
has
observed
and
the
post
office
department
observed
at
that
time,
a
perfect
combination
to
get
american
industry
started
in
this
area.
if
i
may,
let
me
just
quote
that
postmaster
general
which
puts
this
matter
in
perspective.
he
said,
i
would
repeat
that
the
contracting
question,
and
this
is
the
contract
granted
to
panagra
and
he
went
on
to
spell
out
why
it
was
granted
to
panagra.
it
was
granted
to
panagra
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
a
lower
bidder,
the
postmaster
general
said,
it
was
granted
to
panagra
because
panagra
represented
the
joinder
of
pan
american
and
grace
and
their
combined
facilities
were
just
what
the
country
needed
to
get
this
airline
started.
then
they
quote
the
postmaster
general,
i
would
repeat,
“that
the
contract
in
question
is
for
a
route
most
difficult
to
serve,
at
the
same
time
a
very
great
and
far
reaching
importance,
not
only
to
the
public
but
to
the
whole
future
of
transportation
by
it.
failure
would
be
a
serious
blow
to
the
prestige
of
american
aeronautical
enterprise.”
mr.
david
w.
peck
this
was
in
1928,
when
panagra
started.
now,
they
had
an
agreement.
i
say
express,
because
their
letters
of
agreement
certainly
expressly
and
explicitly
said
that
this
airline
must
operate
from
the
canal
zone
south
down
the
west
coast
of
south
america
and
they
used
the
word
‘ultimately',
that
that's
what
it
was
to
do
ultimately.
aside
from
being
expressive,
the
word
express
i
agree
entirely
with
the
solicitor
general
there
would
have
been
implicit
and
inherent
that
these
two
airlines
were
not
to
parallel
each
others
routes.
indeed,
that
was
compelled
by
the
facts
at
that
time,
the
economic
impossibility
of
competition
which
all
of
us
recognized
and
a
policy
defined,
acknowledged,
that
the
post
office
department
not
to
grant
a
mail
contract
or
to
subsidize
more
than
one
airline
on
one
route.
mr.
david
w.
peck
the
east
and
west
coast
were
--
started
almost
simultaneously.
mr.
david
w.
peck
almost
simultaneous.
mr.
david
w.
peck
no,
no.
mr.
david
w.
peck
if
it
just
gotten
its
mail
contract
from
the
united
states
to
the
canal
zone.
that
came
in
1928,
just
before
this
agreement
between
pan
american
and
grace.
mr.
david
w.
peck
all
--
all
--
all
already
together.
as
i
say
it,
so
far
as
pan
american
was
concerned,
all
part
of
a
single
picture
and
it
just
took
grace
as
a
partner
in
this
part.
now,
from
the
facts
which
i
stated
to
the
court,
i
submit
that
the
legality
of
this
arrangement
follows.
and
that
the
district
court
was
entirely
correct
in
that
part
of
its
decision
in
which
it
said
that
this
joinder
of
these
parties
was
a
lawful
combination
with
a
legitimate
end,
that
the
division
of
territories
understanding
and
i
quote
the
district
court
as
to
what
understanding
was,
it
was
not
to
parallel
each
other's
routes,
was
not
unreasonable
under
the
circumstances
that
the
blending
of
these
resources
with
the
financial
and
diplomatic
assistance
of
the
government
pull
to
facilitate
success
of
panagra,
the
american
entry
on
the
west
coast
of
south
america
that
this
was
a
sound
arrangement
for
the
establishment
and
development
of
american
commercial
aviation
on
the
west
coast
useful
to
the
community
and
consistent
with
the
best
interest
of
the
country.
now,
i
come
only
briefly
to
what
the
solicitor
general's
argument
as
i
understand
it
comes
down
to.
i
have
expressed
it
to
the
court
why
i
think
obviously
it
cannot
rest
upon
the
premise
that
this
was
a
joinder
of
dominant
carriers.
certainly,
there
was
no
dominant
airline.
there
was
no
airline
industry
at
all
at
that
time.
on
what
the
government
says
in
its
brief,
a
more
accurate
picture
of
the
argument
and
one
more
realistic
and
fair,
although
i
think
entirely
untenable,
is
that,
while
these
two
companies
were
not
competitors,
that
they
were
potential
competitors.
that
pan
american
might
have
gotten
this
airline
alone,
that's
true,
that
grace
might
have
established
the
airline
alone,
i
doubt
that.
but
then
as
much
as
both
of
them
might
have
done
it,
that
that
was
a
joinder
of
potential
competitors
and
therefore,
competition
potentially
was
frustrated
at
the
outset.
now
in
a
word,
why
i
think
that
argument
cannot
possibly
be
regarded
as
sound
is
that
the
logical,
the
full,
the
inevitable
scope
of
it
is,
that
there
could
never
be
any
kind
of
a
joint
venture
at
any
time.
because
any
joint
venture
represents
a
joinder
of
potential
competitors,
it
represents
two
people
who
want
to
go
in
to
the
business.
speculative,
psychologically
speculative
as
to
whether
they
might
both
go
into
it
separately
if
they
didn't
go
into
it
in
partnership.
but
i
know
of
no
case
that
holds
or
suggests
that
two
people
joining
together
to
create
a
business.
now,
as
distinguished
from
two
competitors,
existing
competitors
joining
together
to
create
a
joint
venture
which
of
course
can
be
an
instrumentality
of
monopoly.
but
i
know
of
no
case
that
lends
any
support
to
the
suggestion
that
two
people
starting
in
on
a
brand
new
venture
have
got
to
do
it
along
upon
the
risk
that
if
they
go
into
partnership
and
the
business
becomes
successful
that
government
will
say
you
have
to
divest
yourselves
because
you
might
have
done
it
alone
and
therefore
your
joinder
in
the
beginning
was
a
joinder
of
potential
competitors.
i
need
not
remind
the
court
that
in
this
day
and
age
of
a
vast
investment
nor
enterprise
that's
required
to
start
many
new
enterprises,
the
whole
world
of
the
underdeveloped
countries
for
example,
the
necessity
of
partnerships
to
have
the
resources
to
start
a
business.
i
can't
imagine
anymore
anti-enterprise
or
anti-endeavor
of
proposition
and
then
the
government
suggest
as
the
predicate
for
its
argument
in
this
case.
now,
i'm
going
to
move
to
where
i
submit
the
district
court
went
terribly
wrong.
in
taking
up,
in
deciding
a
case
that
was
not
brought,
my
first
submission
is
that
everything
that
the
district
court
found
on
the
legality
of
this
arrangement
in
the
beginning,
the
legality
of
the
joint
formation,
the
joint
ownership
and
the
joint
operation
of
panagra
in
and
of
itself
compelled
a
conclusion
that
there
was
nothing
illegal
in
pan
american
doing
what
the
government
has
acknowledge
to
be,
the
mere
exercise
of
the
normal
incidence
of
its
half
ownership
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
joint
venture
should
be
extended.
now,
i
will
try
to
state
quite
briefly
what
this
controversy
is
that
the
district
court
seized
upon
to
make
the
basis
of
its
finding
against
pan
american.
it
is
a
controversy
that
started
in
1938
by
grace
suggesting
that
panagra
be
extended
with
a
route
of
its
own
between
the
united
states
and
the
canal
zone.
let
me
state
the
consequence
of
that
right
off
so
that
the
court
will
understand
the
importance
that
i'm
going
to
develop
this
argument
in
a
more
detail
later.
but
the
consequence
of
what
they
were
talking
about
was
not
competition
between
panagra
and
pan
american.
the
suggestion
in
substance
was
that
panagra
replaced
pan
american
on
this
route
and
put
pan
american
out
of
business
and
let
the
joint
venture
taken
over.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
the
suggestion
perfectly
clear
is
because
the
uncontradicted
evidence
in
this
case
and
indeed
the
finding
of
the
district
court
is
in
accord
with.
that
if
panagra
had
this
route,
it
would
get
all
the
business,
practically
all
the
business
that
went
over
the
pan
american
line.
for
this
obvious
reason,
that
is,
unless,
and
i
emphasize
unless,
at
the
same
time
that
panagra
got
a
route
between
the
canal
and
the
united
states,
pan
american
got
a
route
from
the
canal
down
the
west
coast
of
south
america.
mr.
david
w.
peck
oh
no,
i'm
--
you're
quite
right,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
now,
i'm
only
talking
about
coming
down
from
the
united
states
down
the
west
coast.
because
the
facts
of
life,
perfectly
clear,
considered
that
all
of
the
through
traffic
would
then
go
over
to
panagra
which
is
two-thirds
of
it
and
by
reason
of
the
scheduling
of
flights
and
the
handling
of
the
relative
loads
of
traffic,
the
result
would
be
the
two-thirds
of
the
rest
of
them
would
go
to
panagra.
so
what
this
joint
venture
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
because
they
would
be
able
to
have
so
many
more
airplanes
carrying
the
through
traffic.
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes,
because
the
east
coast
traffic
doesn't
go
that
way.
it
goes
from
new
york
directly
down
the
east
coast
of
south
america.
you
see,
the
pan
american
and
panagra
are
connecting
in
complimentary
carriers.
that's
the
way
they
were
setup,
that's
basic.
pan
american
had
the
route
from
the
united
states
down
to
the
canal
zone
where
it
connected
with
panagra
and
took
the
traffic
down
the
west
coast
of
south
america.
if
panagra
had
the
whole
route,
broke
the
connection
and
have
the
whole
route
to
itself,
it
would
take
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
all
of
that
traffic
that
goes
by
pan
american
either.
certainly,
all
of
it
from
the
united
states
down
the
west
coast
of
south
america
and
indeed
most
of
it
that
goes
from
the
united
states
down
to
the
canal
zone.
so
what
this
partner
was
suggesting
to
its
partner
pan
american
was,
let's
extend
this
joint
venture
to
put
you
out
of
the
business
that
you
would
start
it
first
and
which
was
the
predicate
of
this
whole
venture.
now,
pan
american
naturally
said
no.
and
then
in
1939,
they
reached
an
understanding,
grace
at
that
time
was
complaining
about
the
connecting
service.
they
reached
an
understanding
that
if
according
to
arbitrators,
the
connection
wasn't
sound
then
pan
american
would
consent
to
an
application
for
a
route
of
panagra
zone.
two
years
later,
without
any
suggestion
of
anything
being
wrong
with
the
connection,
without
any
willingness
to
go
to
arbitration,
grace
started
agitating
again.
this
is
after
--
as
a
concession
from
pan
american
they
had
a
man
of
their
own
elected
president
and
general
manager
of
the
company,
despite
the
fact
that
the
agreement
between
the
parties
in
the
beginning
was
that
pan
american
was
to
run
this
airline
and
grace
was
to
supply
the
agencies
in
the
west
coast
of
south
america.
and
in
breach
of
the
first
agreement
and
that
of
the
second
agreement,
in
1941,
grace
filed
this
application
of
its
own
nominally
in
behalf
of
panagra
for
this
route
and
that
ended
in
litigation
by
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
in
grace
versus
the
cab,
in
which
the
second
circuit
said
that.
the
cab
had
jurisdiction
to
entertain
this
application
by
grace
in
behalf
of
panagra.
and
if
it
were
found
by
the
cab,
that
pan
american's
opposition
to
this
extension
was
actuated
by
fraud
and
illegality
then
the
cab
upon
that
finding
could
issue
a
certificate
to
panagra
on
grace's
application.
and
it
was
in
that
connection,
in
which
it
said
that
the
issues
presented
there
which
are
precisely
the
issues
presented
in
this
case
if
there
is
going
to
be
any
section
2
case
against
pan
american
law,
precisely
the
issues
which
grace
have
raised
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
said
in
that
case,
came
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
cab.
well
then,
i
move
ahead
quickly
to
1946,
the
solicitor
general
said
this
matter
in
the
litigation
from
--
for
quite
a
while.
and
in
1946,
grace
and
pan
american
and
panagra
got
together
in
what
is
perfectly
clearly
a
settlement
of
this
controversy
in
which
it
was
finally
agreed
and
approved
by
the
cab
something
which
pan
american
had
been
suggesting
for
years
that
panagra
planes
on
through
flights
fly
over
pan
american's
routes
as
well
as
the
grace
route.
and
that
was
approved
by
the
cab
with
a
finding
that
no
monopoly
would
thereby
be
involved
in
clear
settlement
of
the
controversies
so
everyone
understood
at
that
time.
and
without
enlarging
upon
the
argument,
i
want
to
tell
the
court
with
emphasis
despite
the
brevity
that
in
our
submission,
the
approval
of
that
agreement
by
the
cab
gave
pan
american
immunity
under
section
414
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act,
not
from
all
antitrust
charges,
not
antitrust
immunity
as
the
solicitor
general
said.
but
immunity
from
its
opposition
to
the
extension
of
panagra
to
the
united
states
which
is
the
only
issue
involved
on
this
appeal.
now
the
decision
of
the
district
court
against
pan
american
was
based
on
the
following
claim.
first,
that
pan
american
had
excluded
panagra
from
the
united
states
canal
zone
market.
second,
that
it
was
not
justified
in
doing
so
because
the
territorial
agreement
between
the
parties
not
to
parallel
each
others
routes,
only
run
east
and
west
and
didn't
run
north
and
south.
and
third,
it
was
not
justified
because
panagra
was
not
a
subsidiary
of
pan
american.
the
court
said
that
1%
would
make
all
the
difference
in
this
case,
that
if
they
had
51%,
the
court
indicated
it
would
have
been
alright
to
do
what
they
did.
but
that
having
only
50%,
they
couldn't
do
it.
i'm
not
going
to
enlarge
upon
that
argument,
i
simply
can't
follow.
i
merely
stated
it.
and
finally,
and
most
importantly,
that
this
exclusion
of
panagra
from
this
segment
between
the
united
states
and
the
canal
zone,
gave
pan
american
a
monopoly
on
that
segment
and
in
turn
therefore
a
monopoly
position
in
the
united
states
south
american
traffic.
and
i
emphasize
that
and
i'm
going
to
read
from
the
government's
brief
on
this
because
this
is
what
the
district
court's
finding
comes
down
to.
i
read
from
page
8
of
the
government's
response
in
this
appeal
that
said,
this
holding,
that
is
the
holding
against
pan
american,
was
based
upon
findings
of
pan
american
has
been
since
1928,
the
dominant
air
carrier
on
the
canal
zone
united
states
segment
of
commerce
with
south
america.
that
by
using
its
50%
stock
ownership
in
panagra,
pan
american
prevented
panagra
from
entering
that
segment
of
commerce,
that's
all,
and
thereby
--
thereby,
maintained
its
dominance
not
only
over
air
transportation
between
the
united
states
and
the
canal
zone
but
also
between
the
united
states
and
south
america
as
a
whole.
now,
as
briefly
as
i
can
and
i
hope
time
will
allow,
i
will
tell
the
court
why
i
think
the
district
court's
decision
was
erroneous
on
each
and
everyone
of
those
points.
first,
we
say
that
there
was
no
exclusion
of
panagra
from
this
segment
that
pan
american
came
on
to
the
segment
and
these
flying
panagra
planes
are
flying
over
pan
american
routes
by
virtue
of
the
through
flight
agreement
ever
since
1946
pursuant
to
a
recommendation
made
by
pan
american
going
back
to
1939.
mr.
david
w.
peck
no,
they're
panagra
crew.
secondly,
there
was
no
power
to
exclude
panagra
from
this
segment
by
virtue
of
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
cab
versus
grace,
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
said,
it
is
up
to
the
cab
to
determine
the
legality
and
the
propriety
of
what
pan
american
is
doing
there.
and
unless
the
cab
held
that
they
were
justified
in
doing
it,
they
couldn't
do
it
and
an
application
by
grace
would
be
considered
an
application
by
panagra.
so
we
say
that
pan
american
didn't
have
the
power
to
exclude
panagra.
mr.
david
w.
peck
certiorari
was
granted,
the
case
was
dismissed
as
moot
upon
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
--
the
through
flight
--
the
establishment
of
the
through
flight
agreement
which
is
the
best
evidence
that
the
whole
controversy
was
settled.
thirdly,
about
this
agreement
being
on
the
east-west
which
had
been
the
claim
of
grace
in
the
finding
of
the
district
court
inconsistently,
the
district
court
says
the
agreement
was
that
they
should
not
parallel
each
other's
routes.
it
said
that
their
half
ownership
was
setup
so
that
this
joint
company
would
not
enter
into
competition
would
be
independent
lines
of
the
two
parents.
and
yet,
unaccountably,
i
can
only
say
utterly
unaccountably,
the
district
court
finding
following
the
suggestion
of
grace
says,
the
division,
their
understanding
only
run
east
and
west,
it
didn't
run
north
and
south.
now,
perfectly
obviously
i
say,
it
ran
north
and
south.
every
consideration,
every
single
consideration
for
this
non-paralleling
agreement
applied
equally
to
the
north
and
south
as
to
the
east
and
west,
if
anything
more
so
because
panagra
was
established
to
be
a
connecting
and
complimentary
carrier
with
pan
american.
pan
american
already
had
this
route
down
to
the
canal
zone.
its
only
interest
in
joining
with
grace
was
in
an
airline,
which
was
their
agreement
said,
ultimately
would
go
from
the
canal
zone
down
the
west
coast.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i'm
challenging
the
finding
of
the
judge
which
is
wholly
an
inference.
i'm
challenging
the
finding
of
the
judge
as
being
clearly
erroneous,
mr.
justice
black,
thoroughly
erroneous.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
think
that
you
can
all
--
we
say
this
that
all
one
has
to
do
is
read
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
know
that
it's
an
error.
mr.
david
w.
peck
not
in
the
--
not
in
the
sense
that
you
would
approach
a
case
and
say,
here's
finding
number
one,
number
two
and
number
three,
we
don't
agree
with
that.
i'm
taking
that
some
total
of
these
findings,
breaking
them
up
into
their
various
parts
and
saying
that
this
holding
can't
hold
of
anyone
of
its
joints,
it
has
many
joints
and
not
one
of
them
hold.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
would
say
it
--
yes.
i
would
say
it
was
a
purely
factual
issue
but
i
stand
upon
the
proposition
that
it's
perfectly
clear
that
you
can't
possibly
reach
any
other
conclusion.
for
all
the
reasons
that
was
stated
by
the
district,
for
all
the
reasons
that
are
argued
by
both
the
government
and
the
grace
--
and
grace,
as
to
the
existence
of
the
reason
for
the
justification
of
the
east-west
division,
every
single
argument
fits
like
a
glove
the
north-south
and
compels
the
conclusion.
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
agree
with
that
observation
mr.
justice
white,
yes
indeed.
now,
let
me
--
i
have
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
whole
design
of
panagra
was
to
be
a
connecting
and
a
complementary
carrier
with
pan
american,
not
a
competitive
one.
and
let
me
quote
from
the
grace
memorandum
to
the
district
court,
this
goes
back
to
the
time
because
it
explains
a
good
deal.
grace
hadn't
the
faintest
notion
of
ever
having
such
an
extension
or
have
ever
having
this
airline
do
anything
but
run
south
of
the
canal
because
perfectly
clearly
and
the
district
court
says
this,
that
was
grace's
only
interest.
and
as
grace
said
in
its
memorandum
to
the
district
court,
grace
was
not
interested
in
the
“hazardous
water
crossing
of
the
caribbean
or
the
alternative
of
the
difficult
land
group
through
central
america
but
was
only
interested
in
a
route
starting
from
the
canal
which
was
a
focal
point”
i'm
quoting,
“for
a
large
number
of
steamship
companies
serving
south
america
from
the
united
states
such
as
the
grace
line
and
from
europe.”
mr.
david
w.
peck
now
--
i'm
sorry
that
i'm
--
i
have
to
go
--
then
i'll
have
to
just
say
this,
if
the
court
please.
i
want
to
say
two
things.
if
the
court
assumes,
contrary
to
all
that
i've
argued
up
to
now,
that
there
was
exclusion
of
panagra
here,
that
the
exclusion
was
not
justified,
this
case
founders
fatally
upon
the
key-finding
that
i
read
to
you
from
the
government's
brief
that
the
exclusion
gave
pan
american
a
monopoly
on
this
segment
in
which
it
was
dominant.
there
is
no
evidence
whatever,
i
repeat
it,
there
is
no
evidence
whatever
of
this
suggestion
of
dominance
of
pan
american
upon
this
route.
the
only
evidence,
the
totality
of
evidence
on
this
subject
is
that
there
are
eight
airlines
that
compete
for
this
traffic.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
as
to
the
division
of
the
traffic
between
them
as
to
the
share
of
the
traffic,
this
record
is
bare
as
to
anything
about
competitive
conditions
on
this
segment
except
the
single
significant
fact
that
eight
airlines
compete
for
the
traffic
which
navigates
in
itself
this
suggestion
of
dominance.
now,
the
reason
that
the
evidence
isn't
here
is
just
the
significance
of
the
fact
that
it
isn't
here.
and
that
is
the
government
never
suggested,
never
thought,
never
advanced
the
idea
that
pan
american
was
dominant
on
this
segment
and
that
its
exclusion
of
panagra
gave
it
to
monopoly.
and
furthermore,
equally
significant,
is
the
reason
or
the
way
in
which
the
district
court
came
to
its
conclusion
of
dominance,
it
was
a
mistake
of
law,
pure
and
simple.
as
stated
by
the
district
court,
the
district
court
was
under
the
impression
that
this
traffic
between
these
two
points
was
overseas
traffic
instead
of
foreign
traffic
and
hence
that
the
only
ones
who
could
compete
for
it
were
american
airlines.
what
he
didn't
realize,
no
such
issue
was
presented
or
would
have
been
clarified
that
ever
since
1949,
when
since
the
panama
--
since
the
airbase
--
airfield
for
the
canal
zone
has
been
in
panama,
it
has
been
foreign
traffic
not
overseas
traffic,
and
there
are
eight
lines
competing
from
it,
so
the
whole
finding
of
the
district
on
this
subject
has
no
support
in
fact
and
is
based
entirely
of
panama's
state
of
law.
now
finally
in
a
gallop,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
divestiture.
if
one
were
to
assume
that
i
have
been
wrong
about
everything
that
i've
stated
to
the
court
so
far,
i
would
still
say
that
this
remedy
of
divestiture
is
inadmissible.
it's
unnecessary,
it's
unwarranted
and
it's
unjustified.
in
--
it's
only
suggestion
of
sustaining
it,
the
district
court
cites
the
--
solicitor
general
cites
one
case,
the
dupont
case,
which
holds
a
divestiture
as
a
proper
remedy
where
the
heart
of
the
illegality
is
in
the
intercorporate
combination.
now,
that
is
exactly
what
this
case
isn't
upon
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
there
is
no
illegality
in
the
intercorporate
combination
and
therefore,
divestiture
cannot
be
rested
upon
that
ground.
obviously,
we
submit,
the
legal
remedy
of
injunctions
such
as
incorporated
in
this
decree
would
be
sufficient,
which
is
that
pan
american
should
do
what
the
district
court
said
it
should
have
done
in
the
first
place
and
all
that
the
district
court
said
that
it
should
have
done,
is
to
permit
an
application
to
be
made
to
the
cab
and
then
go
and
argue
it
out
before
the
cab
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
said
it
was
proper
as
to
whether
it
should
be
granted
or
not.
so
a
simple
remedy
of
injunction
would
be
sufficient.
the
other
tragedy
of
divestiture
as
far
as
pan
american
is
concerned,
would
be
that
it
couldn't
possibly
realize
for
the
stock,
anything
that
it
ought
to
realize
for
something
that
it
created
and
build
up
from
nothing.
i
can
leave
it
to
the
court
for
judicial
notice
that
no
one
is
going
to
buy
into
this
airline
50%
of
the
stock
and
become
a
partner
with
grace.
and
finally,
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
beginning,
this
decree
of
divestiture
flies
fairly
in
the
face
of
what
the
cab
has
said
should
happen
here,
it
would
result
in
projecting
panagra
as
a
third
airline
into
an
area
where
the
cab
says
there
must
only
be
two
because
to
have
more
than
two
would
be
either
a
waste
of
public
funds
or
private
investment.
mr.
david
w.
peck
it
obviously
was
not
doing
that
because
that
wasn't
the
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
--
wasn't
the
case.
but
--
mr.
david
w.
peck
i
readily
agree
as
a
legal
finding
but
i'm
saying
that
what
it
said
in
its
process
of
reasoning
in
the
rightness
thereof,
applies
very
squarely
here.
and
further
in
response,
may
i
say,
that
if
there
should
be
any
antitrust
proceeding
in
the
court
here,
it
should
only
come
after
the
cab
has
wrestled
with
this
case
and
decided
that
what
ought
to
be
done
along
the
lines
of
the
second
circuit
lead,
and
if
at
that
time,
the
cab
says
that
the
thing
to
do
is
to
divest
both
of
these
people,
then
it
could
come
to
court
in
an
implementary
way
in
which
the
district
court
would
be
in
the
frame
of
implementing
the
body
that
has
the
responsibility
and
not
going
off
on
an
independent
attack
which
defeats
the
jurisdiction
and
the
responsibility
of
the
agency
that
has
the
responsibility.
mr.
david
w.
peck
yes,
your
honor?
so
long
as
i'm
not
in
my
own
time
anymore.
mr.
david
w.
peck
that
certain
--
it
certainly
is
my
position
in
this
case.
i
see
nothing
that
has
happened
since
1928
to
make
the
joint
ownership
legal
then,
illegal
since.
and
certainly,
there's
no
suggestion
of
that
in
the
district
court's
opinion.
mr.
david
w.
peck
there
is
now
because
these
people
created
it
(voice
overlap)
and
i
think
having
created
something
commendably
and
legally,
they're
entitled
to
keep
it
unless
they've
abused
it
in
some
way
and
certainly
pan
american
in
my
opinion,
our
submission
hasn't
abused
it
in
any
way.
i
say
the
situation
essentially
is
no
different
than
the
pan
american
had
done
here,
what
it
intended
to
do
in
the
first
place
has
established
this
west
coast
airline
on
its
own
and
taking
a
partner
didn't
make
any
difference.
