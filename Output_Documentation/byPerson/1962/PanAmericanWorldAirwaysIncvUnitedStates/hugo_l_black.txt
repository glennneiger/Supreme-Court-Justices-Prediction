do
you
mean
by
that
if
it
were
held
that
the
antitrust
act
had
been
violated,
president
decided
to
give
their
certificate
as
it
was
involved
here,
that
under
the
other
case
--
how
was
that
been
referred
in
the
other
case?
in
other
--
the
other
case
he
could
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
cox,
i
hope
before
you
finish,
you'll
discuss
that
phase
on
this
standpoint.
it's
disturbing
for
me
to
finish
it.
this
court
has
gone
along
to
decide
a
case
of
controversy
which
could
later
--
its
judgment
could
later
be
frustrated
by
the
president
or
an
agency
executive
or
any
other
kind.
that
would
seem
to
raise
questions
on
the
old
cases
at
the
beginning
of
the
history
of
the
country
as
to
what
duties
can
be
opposed
on
this
court,
would
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
that
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
that
wouldn't
prevent
the
--
that
would
quite
answer
the
question,
would
it,
that
our
decree
could
be
upset
by
the
president
or
by
the
executive
agency?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
want
to
(voice
overlap)
further
just
to
say
this
that
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
other
case
stand
at
this
time,
that
the
president
himself
could
do
precisely
what
we
are
being
asked
to
do
here,
could
these
people
ask
for
permission
to
do
it
and
that
if
he
can,
we
should
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
sorry.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
could
they
do
--
what
could
they
do
after
that
fresh
start?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
just
been
reading
--
i'd
like
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
read
the
case
again
mr.
justice
jackson's
court
went
pretty
far
holding
number
one
that
no
order
could
be
reviewed
under
the
enactment
of
foreign
aviation
until
the
president
had
acted,
so
it's
not
a
mature
judgment.
and
after
the
president
acts
then
they
can't
act
at
all.
and
he
calls
attention
to
the
old
policy
of
this
court
not
passing
--
refusing
to
pass
on
matters
where
some
other
agency
could
undo
what
they
have
done.
now,
the
problem
in
my
mind
gets
down
to
this,
if
--
so
far
as
that
question
is
concerned,
suppose
these
people
should
go
--
we
should
--
we
could
render
a
decree,
the
court
does,
says
they
shall
not
--
they
shall
be
separated
and
that
they
be
allowed
to
be
together.
they
then
go
in
and
petitioned
because
they
will
be
allowed
to
go
to
get
together.
why
--
what
could
we
do
about
that
if
the
president
--
cab
decided
it
could
and
the
president
approved
it?(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
oh
no,
come
back
right
away.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
offer
the
--
a
request
applied
to
do
precisely,
form
precisely
the
combination
that
is
here
today.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
you
referred
two
sources
of
power
for
the
president.
one
of
them
being
a
social
--
one
of
them
being
a
social
power
which
according
to
the
court's
judgment
from
which
i
dissented,
which
i
have
a
question
here,
the
president
can
do
what
he
see
is
fit
in
this
field.
that's
the
substance
of
what
the
court
held.
if
that's
--
and
then
therefore
we
said,
we
had
no
jurisdiction.
we
could
never
even
do
it
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
still
leave
me
--
and
now,
this
case
goes
to
the
full
extent
of
saying
that
the
president
--
not
ours
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
to
what
could
be
done
with
reference
to
aviation
in
foreign
fields.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
hope
you
are
right
on
the
way
this
case
would
be
later
construed
when
the
matter
comes
up.
but
this
case
rests
on
the
--
on
one
of
the
--
is
that
the
president
is
commander-in-chief
of
the
army.
he's
in
control
of
our
foreign
affairs
and
that
this
--
the
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
to
anything
as
i
understand
this
--
the
thrust
of
it,
which
would
contradict
his
desire
with
reference
to
who
shall
have
this
carriage,
how
it
should
be
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
what
source
though?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
no
--
no,
it's
not
limited
to
that
as
i
read
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
the
facts
but
the
scope
of
the
holding
if
one
judgment
of
it
all
by
the
opinion
here,
president
has
powers,
commander-in-chief.
by
reason
of
it
being
the
president,
control
of
foreign
affairs
to
determine
these
things,
we
can't
look
at
it
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
hope
that
you
are
right
in
what
you
say
at
least
to
the
point
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
which
you'll
be
limited.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
that
report
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
in
this
argument
you
are
challenging
the
finding
of
the
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
true
with
reference
to
some
of
the
other
arguments
that
you've
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
that
finding,
and
i
know
you're
challenging
others,
is
there
any
place
in
your
brief
where
you
have
set
out
the
findings
that
you
challenge
--
i've
been
a
little
confused
because
i
couldn't
--
didn't
understand
which.
