mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
two
appeals
bring
before
the
court
a
major
government
antitrust
case
involving
air
transportation
between
continental
united
states,
the
canal
zone,
and
south
america.
the
defendants
are
three.
first,
pan
american
airways
which
is
the
largest
international
air
carrier
in
the
world,
its
route
extend
over
most
of
the
globe,
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
it's
enough
to
note
that
pan
american
is
the
dominant
air
carrier
between
the
united
states,
the
caribbean,
and
central
and
south
america.
somewhere
from
66%
to
85%
of
all
passenger
traffic
to
east
and
south
american
is
carried
by
pan
american.
it
carries
50%
of
all
the
traffic
to
south
america
either
alone
or
with
the
baggage.
pan
american's
view
is
always
been,
that
it
should
be
the
only
u.s.
foreign
air
carrier,
the
chosen
instrument
and
presumably
it
still
adheres
to
that
aspiration.
the
second
defendant,
w.r.
grace
and
company,
is
a
holding
company
with
very
diversified
interest,
but
for
present
purposes,
it's
enough
to
note
that
it
owns
the
grace
line,
the
dominant
steamship
company
between
the
united
states
and
the
west
coast
of
south
america,
and
has
a
large
number
of
agencies
itself
along
the
west
coast
of
south
america.
it
carries
today
and
has
for
most
of
the
period
of
this
suit
i
believe,
carried
simply
from
81%
to
94%
of
the
steamship
passenger
traffic
between
the
eastern
united
states
and
western
south
america.
and
it
carried
more
than
50%
of
the
freight.
the
third
defendant
is
pan
american-grace
airways,
an
airline
whose
routes
as
i
shall
show
in
more
detail
in
a
moment,
extend
from
the
canal
zone
along
the
west
coast
of
south
america,
panagra
was
formed
by
combination
of
grace
and
pan
american,
each
owns
50%
of
the
stock.
and
panagra
carries
50%
to
75%
of
the
passenger
traffic
flying
under
the
u.s.
flag
from
the
united
states
to
western
south
america.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
it's
w.r.
grace
and
company
which
owns
grace
lines.
mr.
archibald
cox
these
are
two
subsidiaries.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct
and
pan
am
the
other.
mr.
archibald
cox
fully
owned,
i
believe.
the
heart
of
the
government's
case
is
the
charge
that
the
combination
in
1928
and
1929
of
the
emerging
dominant
air
carrier
between
the
united
states
and
south
america,
with
the
company
that
controlled
the
dominant
steamship
lines
to
the
west
south
america,
along
with
certain
ancillary
understanding.
and
particularly
in
view
of
the
50th
division
of
control
which
gave
either
the
power
to
block
acts
by
panagra
was
in
its
inception
and
in
its
subsequent
operation
an
illegal
combination
in
restraint
of
trade.
most
of
the
facts,
i'm
not
disputed
although
some
of
the
inferences
are
and
in
stating
them
in
somewhat
more
detail,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
the
court
had
in
front
of
it
the
small
map
that
is
in
a
folder
in
the
back
of
our
brief.
this
shows
the
airline
routes
as
they
are
today
but
it's
useful
to
explain
them
as
they
were
earlier.
in
19
--
the
late
1920s
and
early
1930s,
where
the
first
period
of
rapid
growth
in
air
transportation,
especially
foreign
air
transportation
and
largely
under
subsidies
from
the
post
office
for
carrying
mail.
the
success
of
the
u.s.
flag
carriers
in
south
latin
america
was
regarded
as
having
great
diplomatic
and
commercial
importance.
late
in
1927,
pan
american
began
to
plan
the
establishment
of
a
complete
system
of
air
transportation,
serving
the
caribbean
and
central
and
south
america.
it
started
at
miami
and
then
began
to
push
south
to
cuba,
puerto
rico,
barbados
and
trinidad,
and
there
it
later
extended
its
routes
along
the
north
and
east
coast
of
south
america.
it
acquired
its
only
competitor,
only
u.s.
competitor
for
air
mail
contracts
with
the
approval
of
the
post
office
department
and
the
qualified
approval
of
the
department
of
justice.
by
qualified,
it's
approved.
it
said,
we
can
give
you
now
guarantees
as
the
future.
it
was
on
approval
as
of
that
time.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
was
long
before
the
days
of
the
cab
which
was
established
in
1938.
mr.
archibald
cox
gradually,
pan
american
pushed
its
route
south
to
buenos
aires
so
that
it
came
for
our
purposes
to
be
a
carrier
from
florida
to
the
canal
zone
and
to
the
caribbean
islands
and
then
along
the
east
coast
of
south
america.
it's
shown
in
the
map
in
blue,
as
i
said
earlier,
as
it
is
today,
but
this
will
give
you
the
picture.
at
the
same
time,
pan
american
was
interested
in
exploiting
the
west
coast
of
south
america.
in
1927
and
1928,
it
was
negotiating
with
foreign
governments
to
secure
landing
and
operating
rights
in
the
west
coast
countries,
either
directly
or
through
subsidiaries.
and
the
district
judge
found
that
at
this
time,
pan
american
was
far
ahead
of
any
potential
competitors
in
planning
know
how
in
the
ordering
of
equipment.
at
the
same
time,
grace,
which
is
i
have
explained
had
extensive
agencies
of
steamship
interest
on
the
west
coast
of
south
america,
was
beginning
to
explore
the
possibilities
of
west
coast
air
transportation.
she
commissioned
the
study
of
the
routes,
engaged
in
discussions
with
the
post
office
department
about
possible
air
mail
contracts.
and
then
in
august
and
september
of
1928,
pan
american
and
grace
agreed
to
pull
their
interest.
the
basic
letters,
out
of
which
the
combination
emerged,
appear
in
our
brief
at
pages
8
to
10
in
a
footnote
and
they're
also
set
forth
in
full
in
the
district
court's
opinion.
the
initial
step
that's
the
letters
describing,
was
for
grace
and
pan
american
to
for
--
agreed
to
form
a
subsidiary
to
undertake
airplane
transportation
in
peru
under
certain
privileges
that
it'd
been
secured
there
and
it
was
to
contribute
half
of
the
stock.
then
it
was
also
agreed
in
those
letters,
that
pan
american
or
a
holding
company
which
at
that
time
controls
pan
american,
was
attempting
to
secure
an
air
mail
contract
from
our
post
office
department,
to
fly
from
the
canal
zone
down
to
santiago.
and
it
was
agreed
on
the
letter
that
if
they
got
the
contract
and
if
grace
desired
to
come
in,
then
grace
could
come
in
on
the
50/50
basis.
the
contract
was
awarded
to
the
holding
company
that
controlled
pan
american.
grace
did
elect
to
come
in
and
panagra
was
formed
with
grace
and
pan
american,
each
holding
50%
of
the
stock,
and
it
proceeded
to
take
over
their
contract
and
to
establish
what
has
become
the
dominant
airline
on
the
west
coast
of
south
america.
you'll
see
that
its
routes
are
set
forth
in
the
--
shown
on
the
map
in
the
pink
lines,
whereas
pan
american
is
the
blue
line,
with
panagra,
confined
pretty
much
the
west
coast
and
south
of
the
canal
zone
and
pan
american
on
the
east
coast
but
going
on
north
of
the
canal
zone
to
bases
in
the
united
states.
the
yellow
line,
i
should
say,
while
the
--
where
we
have
the
map
in
front
of
us,
is
the
routes
that
braniff
now
flies.
braniff
is
certificated
to
fly
from
the
united
states
to
those
points
in
south
america.
it
secured
its
certificate
in
1946,
so
that
up
until
1946
and
later
as
it
developed,
you
had
only
the
two,
the
red
and
blue,
as
shown
on
the
map.
mr.
archibald
cox
a
transfer
or
issuance
of
a
certificate
involving
overseas
air
carrier,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
chicago
and
southern
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
not
reviewable
and
that
there
was
no
--
as
i
remember
it,
it
was
no
jurisdiction
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
because
this
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
there's
no
presidential
decision
here
except
the
decision
that
braniff
should
be
certificated.
because
these
events
all
took
place
long
before
the
civil
aeronautic
act
and
of
course
nothing
that
comes
out
of
this
case
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
don't
think
those
would
have
to
be
some
of
the
extensions
(voice
overlap)
it
might
have
been
approved
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board
but
that
wouldn't,
as
i
understand
it,
require
presidential
action.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
they
had
grandfather
rights.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
automatic.
mr.
archibald
cox
no
presidential
approval
is
required.
and
equally
of
course,
no
action
will
be
required
as
a
result
of
this
decision
that
would
in
any
way
foreclose
later
action
by
the
cab
or
the
president
with
respect
to
certificates
if
appropriate
applications
were
made
either.
so
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
of
interfering
with
the
decision
of
either
agency.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
suppose
to
try
and
put
it
as
precisely
as
i
have
been
able
to
in
my
own
thinking.
i
suppose
that
if
the
decree
that
we
seek
here,
ordering
pan
american
and
grace,
both
to
divest
themselves
of
any
interest
in
panagra.
it
appears
that
--
then
panagra
withhold
the
certificate.
the
start
would
in
some
way
be
distributed.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
that's
right.
then
let
us
suppose
that
it
were
to
be
--
that
pan
american
were
subsequently
to
come
in
and
say,
“well
now,
we
would
like
to
buy
up
the
stock
from
x.”
we
think
that's
desirable
and
we
want
cab
approved.
i
presume
that
the
final
decree
would
not
foreclose
that
possibility
that
if
the
reason
i
give
is
that
the
board
has
authority
to
authorize
exemptions
from
the
antitrust
laws
and
i
presume
any
decree
ordering
pan
american
to
divest
and
would
imply
an
obligation
to
stay
out
so
long
as
it
--
the
antitrust
laws
required
it
but
if
the
cab
15
years
later,
i
should
say
it
was
consistent
with
national
policy
that
under
the
federal
aviation
act
and
its
authority
to
approve
acquisitions
of
control
and
give
exemptions,
it
could
do
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
here,
mr.
justice
black
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose.
indeed
the
department
of
justice
was
asked
by
the
cab
to
bring
this
action
as
i've
explained
when
i
get
back
to
the
fact.
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
any
such
application
will
be
made
to
the
board
or
to
the
president
or
that
it
will
be
approved.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
if
no
events
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
--
isn't
it
frequently
true
that
new
events
may
develop.
new
legislation
may
be
passed
which
in
the
course
of
time
results
in
a
different
arrangement,
then
it
would
result
under
the
decision
of
the
court.
the
executive
agency
isn't
required
here
either
to
carry
out
nor
is
there
any
suggestion
that
it
can
disapprove
the
court's
decree.
the
court's
decree
would
certainly
require
the
divestiture
of
itself
and
it
would
--
that
would
be
binding,
subject
to
null
frustration
or
review
by
anything.
now,
if
new
events
take
place,
the
--
in
that
upshot
25
or
50
years
later,
as
in
many,
many
cases.
maybe,
that
something
that
develops
that
is
different
from
what
the
court
ordered
pending
the
change
in
the
event.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
that
is
like
old
cases
dealing
with
advisory
opinions
or
requiring
the
executive
department's
approval
of
being
--
order
for
instance
of
the
court
of
claims,
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
this
major
difference,
mr.
justice
and
that
is
neither
the
board
nor
the
president
has
any
authority
to
deal
with
this
combination
as
it
now
stands.
and
it
is
the
cases
here
in
this
court
because
this
combination
has
--
i'm
getting
a
little
ahead
of
myself
of
that
fact
in
the
middle
of
my
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
basically,
the
reason
we
are
here
is
that
this
combination
stand
as
an
obstacle
to
the
sound
development
of
american
aviation
in
relation
to
south
america
in
two
respects.
in
the
first
place,
it
has
brought
together
interest
which
shouldn't
be
competitive,
the
dominant
steamship
and
the
dominant
west
coast
airline
interest
and
has
therefore
prevented
the
development
of
real
competition
between
them
which
is
certainly
inconsistent
with
the
general
policy
that
the
cab
has
adhered
to.
second,
it
has
prevented
the
development
of
a
west
coast
company
which
is
genuinely
competitive
with
pan
america,
especially
the
development
of
a
west
coast
country
that
might
be
competitive
with
pan
american
on
flights
from
the
canal
zone
to
the
united
states.
and
the
combination
is
we
think
illegal
in
that
brief,
also,
it
would
be
for
either
as
in
the
law
but
because
it
has
done
both
of
those.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
certainly
--
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
reasons
to
come
back
to
the
facts.
prior
to
1938,
the
policy
of
the
post
office
department
was
to
subsidize
only
one
line
so
that
no
parallel
policy
at
this
court.
and
the
result
i
think
is
that
there
was
no
likelihood
but
prior
to
1938
that
panagra
or
anyone
else
could
have
gotten
a
route
paralleling
pan
american's
route,
north
of
the
canal
zone.
but
in
1938,
the
policy
changed
with
the
passage
of
the
creation
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board.
and
at
that
time,
grace
began
to
be
anxious
and
so
that
was
cutoff
at
the
canal
zone
to
get
its
own
routes
to
the
united
states
and
it
proposed
pan
american
that
it'd
be
make
an
application.
pan
american
rejected
the
proposal
and
refused
to
vote
to
permit
an
application.
it
took
the
position
that
this
is
--
it
would
not
be
in
the
best
interest
of
our
stockholders
to
authorize
a
panagra
application
to
extend
north
in
competition
with
pan
american.
grace
then
filed
the
grace
half
of
panagra
then
filed
an
application.
because
of
the
war,
there
was
a
considerable
delay.
after
the
war,
the
cab
dismissed
the
application
on
the
ground
that
it
did
not
have
power
to
order
a
carrier
to
make
so
an
extensive
change
in
its
business
as
to
start
flying
from
the
mainland
to
the
canal
zone
in
addition
to
what
had
there
before
have
been
a
south
american
enterprise.
that
case
was
carried
up
to
the
second
circuit,
the
second
circuit
reversed
and
this
court
issued
certiorari.
meanwhile,
following
a
presidential
decision,
braniff
had
been
certificated
to
go
to
south
america
and
to
the
west
coast.
and
the
result
was
that
panagra
was
faced
with
no
through
route,
it
was
dependent
on
connections
of
the
canal
zone.
and
it
had
a
competitor
who
had
a
right
to
fly
through
planes
in
a
through
route.
and
where
that
litigation
would
end
up
that
was
then
pending
in
this
court,
no
one
could
tell.
faced
with
that
condition,
panagra
entered
into
a
“through
flight
agreement”
with
pan
american.
whereby
panagra
planes,
they
now
go
on
to
new
york
through
an
agreement
with
the
national,
panagra
planes
are
flown
to
the
u.s.
mainland
by
pan
american
pilots.
pan
american
controls
the
operations,
issues,
tickets,
handling
of
baggage
and
gets
a
considerable
part
of
the
revenue.
but
at
least
there
is
a
through
claim.
and
at
this
stage
of
panagra
settled
the
business
dispute
on
those
terms
and
did
not
press
any
further
to
litigation
at
that
time.
the
cab
in
1947
and
again
in
1953,
requested
the
department
of
justice
to
institute
this
litigation
and
it
was
instituted
about
1953
pursuant
to
that
request.
the
district
court
made
two
main
rulings.
first,
it
held
that
the
combination
of
pan
american
and
grace
informing
panagra
and
the
subsequent
division
of
territory,
the
east-west
coast,
were
not
illegal.
so
it
ruled
against
us
on
that
point.
it
went
on
to
hold
that
pan
american
subsequent
use
of
its
control
of
50%
of
the
stock
of
panagra,
to
block
panagra's
extension
of
its
route
to
the
united
states
in
competition
with
pan
american.
a
constituted
monopolization
in
violation
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act,
so
it
ruled
and
following
that
ruling,
it
added
an
order
on
requiring
pan
american
to
divest
itself
of
its
50%
of
the
panagra
stock.
but
otherwise,
it
dismissed
the
complaint
so
that
grace
was
left
free
to
retain
its
50%.
the
united
states
and
pan
american
have
both
appealed.
i
plan
in
my
argument
because
there
are
more
issues
here
than
what
can
possibly
cover
in
the
time
permitted
to
direct
myself
to
our
fundamental
contention
that
this
combination
of
the
dominant
steamship
interest
and
the
dominant
air
interest
to
form
a
controlled
airline
in
the
west
coast
of
south
america,
was
itself
in
its
inception
and
subsequent
operation,
an
illegal
combination
in
restraint
occurred.
that
of
course
would
--
if
i
--
we
are
right
in
that,
that
would
not
only
sustain
the
case
so
far
as
the
order
against
pan
american
goes
but
would
require
reversal
so
far
as
the
order
in
favor
of
grace
goes.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
doing
it
simply
because
it
seems
it
makes
the
heart
of
the
case
the
most
effective
argument.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
certainly,
it
can
be
argued
that
pan
american's
subsequent
acts
were
and
are
illegal.
i
see
no
difference
in
what
grace
is
doing
today
from
what
it
was
doing
at
the
beginning.
it
has
been
the
same
from
the
beginning.
the
intent
was
shown
in
the
beginning
and
the
subsequent
events
simply
carried
forward.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
certainly
could
become
illegal
at
a
subsequent
stage,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
the
facts
justify
it
and
i
see
no
real
difference
in
the
court
below.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
there
might
have
been
subsequent
developments
which
turned
to
what
had
been
legal
into
an
illegal
combination.
i
was
about
to
say
that
the
--
with
respect
to
the
monopolization
aspect
of
the
case
and
some
of
the
subsidiary
claims
that
those
that
we
will
have
to
submit
on
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
and
on
our
brief
where
they
are
thoroughly
covered.
now
there
are
two
preliminary
points
that
i
must
mention.
first
is
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
in
the
order
putting
the
case
on
the
calendar,
the
court
asked
counsel
to
reque
--
to
discuss
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
that
was
done
after
the
brown
shoe
case
had
been
argued
orally
and
prior
to
the
decision
in
the
brown
shoe
case,
and
in
our
view,
indeed
the
view
of
all
the
counsel,
the
brown
shoe
case
is
decisive
here
because
this
order
does
either
dismiss
the
government's
case
or
order
divestiture
unqualifiedly
and
therefore
it
seems
to
us
--
to
be
exactly
likely
question
presented
and
decided
in
brown
shoe.
the
other
preliminary
question
that
i
should
note
is
the
question
whether
this
action
should
have
been
in
court
at
all
or
whether
it
was
a
proceeding
that
should
have
been
brought
before
the
civil
aeronautics
board.
pan
american
suggests
somewhat
faintly
that
the
federal
aviation
act
gives
air
carriers
a
blanket
immunity
and
that
they
are
no
longer
subject
to
prosecution
under
any
circumstances
under
the
sherman
act.
we
think
that's
quite
plainly
wrong
for
three
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
this
is
not
so
detailed
a
system
of
regulation
that
one
could
find
and
--
an
intention
impliedly
to
repeal
all
earlier
statutes
and
they
could
mean
applicable.
for
example,
with
respect
to
foreign
air
carriers,
there's
no
regulation
of
rates.
second,
the
federal
aviation
act
does
contain
or
authorize
two
specific
kinds
of
exemptions
from
the
antitrust
law.
and
the
specification
for
those
--
of
those
specific
exemptions
it
seems
to
us
to
imply
as
it's
been
held
in
other
cases
involving
other
regulatory
acts
indicate
that
no
general
blanket
immunity
is
intended.
mr.
archibald
cox
one
of
them
has
to
do
with
mergers
and
the
other
has
to
do
with
agreements
between
carriers
relating
to
pulling
some
things
of
that
kind.
i
think
412
is
the
section
i
believe.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
federal
aviation
act
is
compare
--
yes,
there
was
an
intervening
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
so
too,
yes
sir.
i
was
referring
to
the
present
law.
next,
we
submit
that
the
case
is
not
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
because
the
board
had
no
power
to
deal
with
the
basically
unlawful
combination
which
is
attacked
by
the
government's
case.
the
civil
aeronautics
board
can't
determine
the
legality
of
a
combination
formed
in
1928.
it
has
no
power
to
grant
the
relief
that
we
seek
here.
and
in
addition,
there
is
nothing
in
the
decree
which
we
seek
here,
which
would
anyway
interfere
with
its
power
to
issue
certificates
or
make
decisions
concerning
routes.
mr.
archibald
cox
--
in
this
case,
to
where
that
the
combination
of
pan
american
and
grace
to
form
panagra,
each
holding
50%
of
the
stock
together
with
the
division
of
territory
and
other
related
arrangements.
both
was
in
the
beginning
and
in
its
subsequent
operation
continued
to
be,
an
illegal
combination
in
restraint
of
trade.
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
it
seemed
to
us
to
make
it
plain,
that
the
combination
was
put
together
partly
for
a
business
purpose
but
also
with
an
intent
of
avoiding
true
competition
and
protecting
the
interest
of
grace
on
the
one
hand,
the
other
interest
of
grace
on
the
one
hand
and
pan
american.
the
district
court
opinion
appears
in
volume
11
of
the
record.
and
at
page
5388,
where
you
can
find
the
judge
saying,
grace
was
aware
of
the
competitive
potential
of
air
transportation
with
its
large
steamship
investments,
so
as
pan
american
aware
of
potential
competition.
and
then
over
on
the
next
page,
by
joining
with
each
other
in
a
joint
venture
on
the
west
coast,
grace
on
the
one
hand
would
be
assured
against
the
entry
of
an
independent
american
airline
competitor
into
its
west
coast
demand
and
gain
time
to
get
experience.
pan
american
on
the
other
hand,
would
be
substantially
free
from
american
flag
competition
in
the
rest
of
south
america.
their
method
of
organization
of
the
joint
company
appears
calculated
to
give
each
negative
control
of
the
company
in
order
to
assure
against
possible
treachery
of
the
other
to
expand
the
operations
of
the
company
in
competition
with
their
respective
independent
line.
pan
american
has
never
denied
as
i
understand
it,
that
it
was
their
intention
that
panagra
should
not
furnish
competition
with
pan
american's
own
lines.
grace
in
its
argument
here
protest
that
grace
had
no
intention
but
to
set
up
being
a
--
going
business,
but
that
seems
to
me
hardly
to
have
been
the
intention
of
its
offices
as
they
declared
it
at
the
time
the
combination
was
formed.
for
example,
iglehart
then
the
president
of
the
grace
--
of
grace
have
wrote
to
one
of
his
close
associates
in
1930,
this
was
just
a
few
years
later.
i've
got
volume
2
--
3,
page
966
of
the
record.
we
went
into
this
business
because
we
felt
that
in
view
of
our
big
investment
in
steamers,
we
should
become
a
party
to
this
new
branch
of
transportation
which
will
yearly
become
more
important.
and
in
10
years,
will
be
a
real
competitor
of
our
steamers
over
a
968,
a
memorandum
written
a
month
later.
he
again
says
to
an
associate,
“we
went
into
the
business
because
we
felt
that
in
10
years
from
now,
air
transport
would
be
a
--
an
important
competitor
of
steamer
transport
in
which
we
have
so
large
investment.”
as
i
say,
i
think
the
aim
was
both
to
control
potential
competition
but
we
do
not
mean
to
say
that
grace
was
not
anxious
to
have
the
airline
investment
succeed
once
it
went
into
them.
but
to
where
it
wished
the
two
to
progress
is
pretty
well
revealed
in
another
letter
which
was
written
--
which
appears
on
969,
a
memorandum
written
by
iglehart
to
some
of
the
subordinate
officers
of
the
company.
i'm
anxious
as
i
know
you
are
anxious
to
see
the
traffic
airplanes
built
up
in
a
very
aggressive
way.
then
it
goes
on
into
some
details.
further
down,
why
not
talk
over
the
idea
with
mann,
carter
and
young
who
are
all
here
now
and
see
whether
you
can
get
a
practical
suggestion,
get
hold
of
a
man
who
would
not
only
build
up
the
air
traffic
but
would
build
it
up
in
a
way
which
would
not
necessarily
draw
traffic
from
our
steamship
line.
then
skipping
a
bit,
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
steamer
and
air
traffic
are
competitors
but
i
believe
that
by
handling
the
whole
matter
as
i've
indicated,
we
may
avoid
the
prejudice
of
competition.
his
notion
of
what
was
meant
by
avoid
the
prejudice
of
competition
appears
in
a
letter
written
in
1933,
again
to
a
company
official,
where
he
suggest
you
check
up
but
i
think
you'll
see
that
from
a
particular
instance,
i'm
on
977
now,
air
rates
are
getting
too
low
in
comparison
with
steamship
rates.
in
other
words,
build
them
up
but
not
so
there's
any
real
competition.
i
think
you
might
wish
to
have
pushed,
put
all
the
facts
before
you,
and
see
whether
your
panagra
rates
now
actually
got
too
low.
and
whether
or
not,
there
is
in
some
way
jacking
them
up,
that
suddenly
or
in
a
radical
way
gradually
we
know
that
these
things
can
be
done
gradually
without
calling
attention
or
creating
any
opposition,
whereas
they
have
done
too
quickly
and
they're
likely
to
attract
opposition.
compete
but
don't
compete
too
vigorously
and
lets
us
control
both
where
there
could
be
more
vigorous
competition
if
the
agents
who
are
handling
it
were
not
subject
to
divided
loyalties.
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
there
are
two
points
in
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
i
am
going
to
now
show
how
the
intent
was
--
became
real,
if
i
may
put
it
that
way.
how
competition
was
actually
restrained
by
this
potentially
restrictive
arrangement.
first
and
between
steamship
and
airline,
between
grace
and
panagra
and
then
second,
i
will
turn
to
the
pan
american
aspect
of
it.
now
the
district
judge,
i
really
am
coming
to
your
question,
the
district
judge
said
that
this
allegedly
unlawful
combination
of
airline
and
steamship
interest,
was
not
an
unlawful
combination
because
these
two
weren't
competing
in
the
same
market.
that
conclusion
seems
to
us
not
only
to
be
plainly
erroneous
on
the
evidence
but
also
to
be
based
essentially
on
a
misconception
of
the
applicable
legal
standard.
airlines
and
steamships
are
alternative
and
therefore
we
say,
competing
methods
for
carrying
passengers.
the
airline's
share
of
passenger
traffic
has
risen
from
a
very
small
percentage,
so
that
today
--
and
so
did
1957,
it
was
84%.
now
bearing
in
mind
that
shift
and
bearing
it
in
mind
that
there
are
250,000
travelers
a
year
between
the
united
states
and
south
america,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
defies
common
sense
to
suppose
that
there
aren't
a
considerable
number
of
those
travelers,
because
of
these
travels
are
for
pleasure,
whose
choice
will
not
be
affected
by
considerations
balancing
comfort,
convenience,
rates,
time
and
other
factors
throwing
them
all
into
the
pot,
by
the
way,
we
all
know
that
--
we
and
our
friends
do
when
you
decide
which
way
to
go
to
europe.
but
this
is
not
just
speculation.
there's
ample
evidence
of
current
competition,
mr.
justice.
my
first
answer
is
that
even
with
respect
to
passenger
traffic,
there's
ample
evidence
of
competition.
my
second
answer
to
your
question
and
second
submission
with
respect
to
this
aspect
of
the
case
is
that
we
want
to
be
sure
that
the
same
thing
doesn't
happen
with
air
freight
with
cargo
in
the
day
of
cargo
which
is
growing,
that
happened
in
the
1930s
with
respect
to
passenger.
so
that
it
may
be
that
most
of
the
incidents
with
respect
to
passengers
are
in
a
sense
path.
we
think
that
that
evidence
is
important
with
respect
to
the
current
competition
for
passenger
but
even
more
important
because
it
shows
the
impossibility
where
you
have
a
steamship
company
and
an
airline
company
for
the
same
people
to
act
for
those
conflicting
interest
the
same
way
that
independent
agents
or
officers
would
represent
those
interests.
and
there
is
as
i
shall
show
in
the
moment,
a
great
opportunity,
with
respect
to
cargo
where
it's
particularly
important
that
this
should
not
occur.
now,
the
evidence
of
competition
with
respect
to
passengers
is
the
testimony
of
various
witnesses.
ferguson,
the
treasure
of
pan
ameri
--
pan
american
was
asked,
“does
pan
american
engaged
in
publicity
efforts
to
sell
passengers
on
the
idea
that
an
air
trip
is
more
pleasant
than
a
sea
trip?”
“oh
i'm
sure
we
do.”
after
some
omissions,
“do
you
consider
that
pan
american
is
in
competition
with
the
steamship
lines?”
“very
definitely,
we
are
both
trying
to
get
the
same
market.”
in
addition,
you
will
find
many
comments
in
the
internal
grace
correspondence
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
showing
that
the
agents
were
all
too
aware
of
the
competition
that
panagra
officers
were
frustrated
because
they
felt
that
the
agents
were
more
loyal
to
the
steamships
than
they
were
to
the
airlines.
there
was
even
one
instance
of
a
prospective
passenger
who
went
into
in
grace
agency
and
he
wanted
to
make
a
trip
in
a
hurry.
how's
the
fastest
way
i
can
get
to
the
united
states?
and
the
agent
got
out
all
the
folders
for
the
steamship
company
and
figured
out
to
sailings
and
so
forth
and
the
man
said,
well,
there's
an
airline.
oh
yes,
but
that's
not
as
safe
as
a
steamship
but
that
was
the
--
this
was
inevitable
in
the
senate.
now,
the
panagra
officials
--
many
of
them
protested
against
it
but
i
think
the
inherent
part
of
the
--
unavoidable
part
of
the
arrangement.
second,
we
say
that
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
the
--
i'm
not
sure
what
your
honor
has
reference
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
it
is
--
as
i've
said
(voice
overlap)
i
don't
want
to
overstate
my
case,
i
think
it's
quite
true
that
there
have
been
many
grace
officials
who
wanted
this
airline
to
succeed
and
i
realize
their
interest
in
it.
but
--
and
i
don't
think
that
i
can
make
a
case
except
for
some
instances
like
that
letter
from
mr.
iglehart
where
there
was
a
deliberate
instructions
to
suppress
it.
but
there
was
an
inherent
recognition
especially
down
the
line
that
if
this
shipment
go
or
this
passenger
goes
by
water,
grace
gets
a
hundred
percent.
if
he
goes
by
air,
grace
gets
a
much
smaller
percent.
and
there
was
a
problem
of
which
commission
would
the
agent
get
whether
it
goes
one
way
or
another.
and
this
it
seems
to
us
still
exists
as
shown
by
the
testimony
from
ferguson.
now,
with
respect
to
cargo,
the
gross
of
air
freight
bids
fair
to
become
spectacular
during
the
next
three
decades
as
the
growth
of
passenger
traffic
was
in
the
past.
mr.
archibald
cox
for
the
purposes
of
the
present
case
mr.
justice,
we
can
fully
agree
that
if
grace
had
built
up
this
airline
by
itself
on
the
west
coast,
a
hundred
percent,
that
there
would
be
no
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
there
is
some
authority
to
the
contrary
of
that
and
i
simply
without
making
any
concessions
lay
it
to
one
side,
i
do
not
pitch
my
case
upon
it.
indeed,
we've
waived
it
in
effect,
our
argument
is
that
even
though
a
company
may
go
in
and
do
this
by
itself,
there
are
many
things
that
you
may
do
by
yourself
that
you
cannot
go
and
do
by
combination.
and
here,
grace
got
together
with
pan
american
but
grace
might
or
might
not
have
been
so
successful
doing
it
alone.
pan
american
might
have
gotten
in
there
ahead
of
grace
so
they
might
both
have
been
there.
so
that
our
case
rests
on
the
doing
by
combination,
and
of
course
this
combination
between
the
steamship
and
airline
interest
is
only
one
aspect
of
it,
the
highly
important
one
but
only
one
aspect
as
the
wholly
illegal
combination.
i
was
about
to
point
out
the
potentialities
of
air
cargo
in
19
--
taking
all
airlines,
in
1945,
there
were
only
9
million
revenue
ton
miles.
in
1961,
a
decade
and
a
half
later,
there
were
308
million
revenue
ton
miles
of
air
freight,
a
30-fold,
34-fold
increase.
furthermore,
the
kinds
of
freight
carried
by
airplane
have
--
it
must
be
realized
become
very
fair.
the
record
shows
here
that
the
freight
carried
by
airplane
to
south
america
has
included
--
with
south
america
has
included
such
things
as
cattle,
industrial
machinery,
automobiles,
refrigerators,
wearing
apparel,
bricks,
onions
and
so
forth.
it
is
a
diverse
service
today.
finally,
i
should
emphasize
this
part
of
the
background
that
relative
transportation
cost
which
we'll
realize
of
course
when
you
stop
the
think
are
not
to
be
determined
simply
by
looking
at
the
rates,
the
cost
of
handling,
transshipment,
warehousing,
different
forms
of
packaging
and
so
forth,
so
that
what
is
superficially
non-competitive
in
the
case
of
the
rates,
being
in
truth
the
competitive
in
that
pressure.
now
here,
grace's
insistence
that
all
airlines
can't
really
compete
for
freight
with
steamships
if
--
which
is
its
litigating
position,
if
that
is
the
company's
commercial
position,
it
seems
to
be
--
us
to
be
the
best
evidence
in
the
world
of
the
anti-competitive
dangers
of
putting
the
same
company
in
control
of
both
steamers
and
airlines.
because
the
record
has
a
great
deal
of
testimony
in
it,
about
the
competition
that
airlines
can
offer
steamship
transportations.
conwell,
a
cargo
sales
manager
for
pan
american
was
asked,
“from
your
point
of
observation,
would
you
say
there
is
an
active
area
of
competition
in
the
north
america
and
south
america
trade
between
air
carriers
and
ships?”
well
yes,
i
believe
there
is
an
active
area
of
competition
between
surface
and
air
at
the
present
time.
carl
michael,
the
president
and
general
manager
of
an
oil
cargo
carrier
serving
the
caribbean
and
south
america
was
asked
whether
there
was
an
area
of
competition.
well,
our
particular
face
of
operations
i
consider
most
definitely
competitive.
and
he
went
on
to
list
specific
instances
of
competition
between
himself
and
the
steamers.
riddle,
the
president
of
the
riddle
airline
which
does
not
serve
latin
america
apparently
but
which
nevertheless
is
one
of
the
biggest
freight
carriers
testified
too
of
his
ability
to
compete
and
frequent
competition
with
steamer
transportation.
and
we
set
forth
in
our
brief,
references
to
gold
and
platinum
shipments
as
specific
illustrations
of
instances
in
which
panagra,
for
example
got
some
gold
shipments
that
had
previously
gone
by
grace.
there
was
intercompany
correspondents
pointing
out
that
if
only
they'd
gone
by
water,
grace
would
have
got
a
hundred
percent
of
the
revenue
whereas
going
by
air
of
pan
american
got
some
and
some
u.s.
domestic
carrier
got
some.
so
that
there's
ample
testimony
of
instances
in
which
there
are
competition.
now,
grace
says
to
this,
as
the
district
judge
did,
that
while
looking
at
the
whole
picture,
the
two
really
aren't
competitive.
in
the
case
of
passengers,
there
are
great
many
people
short
of
time
and
they'll
only
go
by
airline,
water
obviously
isn't
competitive
as
to
that.
and
he
might
have
said
and
did
say
in
effect
that
the
shipments
of
grain,
fertilizers,
ores
and
so
forth
and
of
course
the
airlines
don't
cover
to
carry
those.
and
the
result
is
that
if
you'd
assume
that
all
passengers
once
are
interchangeable
and
that
all
freight
is
fungible,
then
you
do
find
only
a
small
part
of
the
passengers
going
by
water
and
only
a
very
small
part
of
the
freight
going
by
air
relatively
speaking.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
number
of
fallacies
in
this
contention.
in
the
first
place,
percentage
figures
based
on
the
total
freight
or
total
passengers
are
meaningless
because
they're
made
up
of
all
different
kinds
of
freight.
and
to
talk
about
the
way
petroleum
is
carried
and
how
much
petroleum
or
grain
isn't
carried
by
air,
doesn't
bear
on
the
extent
of
competition
that
there
is
for
other
kinds
of
traffic.
so
too,
the
total
volume
of
traffic
is
to
which
there
is
a
competition
is
not
small
indeed.
panagra
carried
8
million
revenue
ton
miles
and
had
gross
merit
revenues
of
two
and
a
half
million
from
freight
or
cargo
carriers
during
1961.
and
if
it's
two
and
a
half
million
that
it
carry,
there
must
be
a
great
deal
more
as
to
which
there
was
a
competition
if
it
had
been
vigorously
pressed.
the
fundamental
legal
fallacy
i
think
in
counsel's
argument
is
in
attempting
to
focus
attention
at
the
extremes
of
a
wide
range
of
different
kinds
of
cargo
or
different
kinds
of
passengers.
undoubtedly,
at
one
end
of
the
range,
there
is
cargo
that
will
travel
only
by
water
and
that
the
other
end
of
the
range
is
cargo
or
passengers
that
will
travel
only
by
air.
now,
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
situation
and
which
there
had
been
a
number
of
competitive
steamship
--
number
of
competitive
steamship
company,
and
they
were
being
merged
into
a
unit.
and
the
question
was
whether
that
was
a
combination
in
restraint
of
trade.
it
would
not
be
an
answer
if
they
monopolize
--
they
combined
a
large
part
of
the
steamship
market
to
say,
oh
well
you
might
ship
your
grain
or
oil
by
airplane
because
for
some
purposes,
the
steamer
market
is
the
only
one
reasonably
available
to
a
lot
of
people.
but
if
you
--
our
concern
with
putting
the
--
what
already
is
the
dominant
steamship
company,
together
with
the
dominant
airline
and
you
ask
is
this
kind
of
result
in
a
lessening
of
competition.
true,
it
may
not
directly
lessen
the
competition
with
respect
to
the
people
who
could
travel
only
by
water
or
the
people
who
can
travel
only
by
air,
or
the
cargo
that
can
travel
only
one
way
or
only
the
other.
but
there's
this
band
in
the
middle
where
they
are
interchangeable
and
this
makes
it
proper
to
let
--
to
that
band
in
the
middle
and
say,
is
this
a
substantial
restraint
of
interstate
of
foreign
commerce.
and
in
this
instance,
we
think
quite
plainly
that
we
have
shown
that
it
is.
i
should
emphasize
that
the
view
that
competing
forms
of
transportation
ought
not
to
be
under
common
control,
is
very
deeply
embedded
in
our
national
policy.
one
finds
it
in
the
panama
canal
act
applicable
to
all
rail
and
water
carriers.
one
finds
it
in
the
motor
carrier
act
applicable
to
railroad
and
motor
carriers.
one
finds
it
in
the
federal
aviation
act
applicable
to
the
acquisition
of
control
of
an
air
carrier
by
a
form
of
surface
transportation.
and
the
courts
of
appeals
in
approving
civil
aeronautics
board
orders
have
frequently
noted
that
there
is
competition
between
the
two.
indeed,
the
civil
aeronautics
board
itself
once
refused
grace
authority
to
establish
an
airline
to
the
caribbean
on
the
ground
that
it
would
be
expecting
too
much
to
assume
that
in
that
--
that
that
transportation
company
would
be
in
a
position
to
provide
vigorous
competition
for
its
steamship
interest.
now,
turning
to
the
other
half
of
the
combination,
we
think
that
there
was
equally
plainly
an
inherent
tendency
to
restrain
and
an
actual
restraint
of
competition
with
respect
to
air
transportation
itself.
first,
the
combination
inclined
and
resulted
in
a
division
of
territory
with
pan
american
receiving
the
east
coast
of
south
america,
you'll
remember
all
the
blue
was
down
that
side
of
the
map,
and
panagra
receiving
the
west
coast
of
south
america.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
the
figures
--
the
figures
with
respect
to
passengers
carried
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
a
considerable
detail,
both
in
the
statement
of
facts
and
then
in
a
later
argument
as
showing
the
dominance
of
the
companies.
for
--
i
can
give
you
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
some
of
them
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
foreign
carriers
aren't
broken
down
but
there
are
in
the
brief
--
well,
you
will
find
63
and
64
but
there
are
some
references.
these
companies
--
these
two
companies
carry
half
of
all
the
traffic
and
75%
to
83%
of
the
u.s.
flag
traffic,
the
foreign
carriers
are
not
broken
down
by
company
but
the
mark
--
rest
of
the
market
is
divided
among
15
or
16,
each
of
which
has
a
very
small
part.
mr.
archibald
cox
i've
referred
to
the
division
of
territory
between
panagra
and
pan
american,
it
suggested
in
the
briefs
for
grace
that
--
well
this
came
to
an
end
in
1938,
but
we
find
a
number
of
references
following
1938
where
grace
and
grace
officials
were
still
speaking
in
terms
of
a
division
of
territory
between
pan
american
and
panagra.
those
are
cited
and
quoted
at
some
length
in
our
reply
brief
which
develops
this
evidence
and
rather
than
take
the
time,
i
would
simply
refer
the
court
to
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
as
i
understand
their
argument,
it
is
--
it's
this.
yes
of
course,
there
was
a
division
of
territory
up
to
1938
because
you
couldn't
get
competing
air
mail
contract.
it's
--
and
after
that,
it
could,
well
i'm
not
sure
that
that
really
applies
to
all
these
points
that
they
divided.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
very
--
it's
--
in
all
honesty,
very
hard
to
tell.
there
are
telegrams
and
letters
speaking
of
an
agreement
so
that
when
they
speak
of
an
--
in
expressed
terms
of
what
the
agreement
is.
on
the
other
hand,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
all
probability
that
this
agreement
was
simply
inherent
in
the
basic
original
setup.
that's
one
of
the
vices
of
the
basic
original
setup.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
has
gone
--
that
is
my
basic
point
and
that
it
doesn't
stand
on
some
expressed
terms
in
--
but
this
inherent
in
the
--
unavoidable
in
the
set
up.
now,
the
second
place
where
a
restraint
in
air
competition
was
inherent
in
the
setup
and
therefore
unavoidable
is
in
the
commerce
with
buenos
aires.
both
airlines,
panagra
and
pan
american,
run
down
the
buenos
aires.
the
shorter
route
by
air
miles
is
the
panagra
route.
but
we
find
a
number
of
instances
in
which
panagra,
a
number
of
ways
in
which
panagra
was
kept
from
competing
vigorously
with
respect
to
those
flights.
it
couldn't
have
its
own
offices.
the
maps
that
were
put
out
in
publicity
by
pan
american
ostensibly
for
both
a
distortedly
map
showed
the
distance
wrongly.
agents
were
even
instructed
on
occasion
to
sell
pan
american
routing
unless
the
travelers
expressly
requested
panagra.
again,
i'm
not
relying
on
these
specific
violations
if
i
could
call
them
that,
but
rather
on
the
fact
that
this
was
an
inescapable
consequence
of
the
basic
and
continuing
arrangement.
now,
it
is
plain
i
think
that
in
both
its
steamship
and
airline
aspect
that
the
combination
tended
to
inhibit
and
did
inhibit
competition.
and
the
critical
question
i
suppose
becomes
whether
the
combination
is
saved
from
illegality
by
its
business
success.
our
answer
or
answers
very
briefly
to
that,
they're
developed
in
the
brief
are
these.
first,
neither
the
court
nor
an
agency
can
excuse
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
on
the
argument,
well
this
is
really
been
a
good
thing
for
the
country.
second,
this
combination
plainly
contemplated
and
accomplished
a
division
of
territory
and
the
division
of
territory
is
a
perceived
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
now,
it
said
here,
well
this
was
a
new
enterprise
and
was
an
area
which
neither
of
us
served
before.
but
if
the
two
companies
or
three
companies,
selling
a
new
product
in
the
mississippi
valley
were
to
say
when
you
go
and
exploit
the
east
coast
and
i'll
go
and
exploit
the
west
coast
and
neither
of
us
will
compete
with
the
other
perfectly
or
plainly
even
so
it
was
a
new
product,
that
would
be
a
combination
or
agreement
in
restraint
of
trade
under
the
sherman
act.
third,
we
point
out
that
no
combination
of
such
dominant
firms
as
pan
american
and
grace
has
ever
been
held
justifiable
under
the
rule
of
reason.
and
fourth,
we
say
even
if
the
rule
of
reason
does
apply,
even
if
one
must
weigh
the
business
gains
against
the
costs,
still
this
combination
must
be
condemned.
now,
it
must
be
remembered
that
whatever
post
office
policy
or
the
commercial
necessity
might
have
required
in
1928,
it
certainly
didn't
require
putting
the
dominant
steamship
interest
in
50%
control
of
what
was
to
be
the
air
carrier.
and
it
certainly
didn't
require
of
combining
the
dominant
steamship
interest
with
the
dominant
airline
interest.
and
still
is,
we
submit,
did
it
require
setting
up
an
arrangement
which
would
project
this
control
way
into
the
future.
and
then
all
of
those
three
counts,
this
went
way
beyond
post
office
policy
and
way
beyond
anything
that
could
be
justified.
now,
i
would
like
in
my
last
minute
or
two,
to
go
back
to
the
question
raised
by
justice
black
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument.
it
does
seem
to
me
here
mr.
justice,
that
this
court's
decree
and
only
this
court's
decree
can
break
up
this
illicit
combination
and
there's
no
other
agency
that
can
deal
with
it.
that
is
why
the
case
is
here.
it
is
also
true
that
if
divestiture
is
ordered,
nothing
can
or
will
frustrate
unless
congress
changes
the
law.
that
decree,
there
will
have
to
be
divestiture.
and
then
the
civil
aeronautics
board
and
the
president
will
get
a
fresh
start
so
that
the
court's
decree
to
that
extent
would
accomplish
something
that
only
a
court
decree
can
do
and
there's
no
question
of
its
being
set
aside
by
anybody.
mr.
archibald
cox
after
that
fresh
start,
the
number
of
things
might
develop.
the
civil
aeronautics
board
had
said
that
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
in
its
tentative
judgment
is
that
to
be
a
single
u.s.
airline
on
the
west
coast
of
south
america.
another
thing
that
could
happen
after
that
fresh
start
is
that
panagra
might
become
an
independent
company
or
grace
might
acquire
all
of
it.
conceivably,
pan
american
might
acquire
all
of
it.
the
one
thing
that
we
could
be
sure
that
would
not
have
because
the
cab
and
everyone
concerned
has
found
it
intolerable
is
that
this
particular
arrangement
that
nothing
but
a
court
decree
can
resolve
would
ever
come
back
again.
indeed,
i
think
the
parties
will
agree
that
that
will
never
be
brought
back
to
any
agency
again.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
excuse
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
that
in
the
first
place
sir
--
if
they
came
back
20
years
later.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don't
think
anything
could
happen
to
frustrate
the
order
of
divestiture.
even
then,
there
would
have
been
a
basic
change
in
the
circumstances.
this
court
would
have
cleared
the
desk
and
created
an
arrangement
whereby
the
cab
and
the
president
can
pass
on
whatever
applications
maybe
submitted
to
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
suppose
--
may
i
answer
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
by
putting
an
illustration.
suppose
that
you
are
trespassing
everyday
over
my
land,
or
at
least
i
think
you
are.
and
you
assert
that
you
have
some
right
of
prescription
or
lost
grant
that
gave
you
the
power
to
do
it.
and
i
went
in
before
the
judge
and
said,
i
want
an
injunction
to
restrain
this
trespasser
from
going
over
my
land.
and
the
judge
said,
well
i
know,
you're
a
soft-hearted
fellow
in
any
way
you
appear
before
mr.
justice
black
all
the
time.
even
if
i
grant
the
injunction,
you're
likely
to
give
him
a
license,
my
reply
would
be,
well
at
least,
i
will
then
have
the
opportunity
to
decide
whether
i
want
him
doing
it
or
not,
which
is
something
that
i
don't
have
now.
in
fact,
i
don't
want
him
doing
it
now
but
he's
persisting
in
doing
it.
and
i
don't
think
the
judge
would
say,
well
this
means
you're
likely
to
frustrate
my
decree
and
therefore
i
will
not
grant
you
the
injunction.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
--
of
course,
i
take
it
that
what
was
really
in
a
--
the
mind
of
the
majority
at
that
stage
and
the
decision
has
been
much
criticized
by
teachers
and
administrative
law
and
others
but
i
take
it
that
was
--
what
was
in
--
as
what
supports
justice
jackson's
reasoning
was
the
theory
that
the
president's
decision
will
be
based
not
only
on
matters
in
the
record
but
on
a
lot
of
other
matters
in
considerations
which
aren't
properly
subject
to
traditional
cognizant.
there's
no
suggestion
here
that
anything
we
based
on
anything
other
than
the
record
that
is
before
the
court.
and
there's
no
--
the
president
has
no
power
with
respect
to
this
combination
to
step
in
and
say,
i
want
you
to
do
thus
or
so.
indeed,
he
has
no
power
in
the
future
to
step
in
and
say,
i
want
you
to
do
thus
and
so.
the
very
most
that
he
could
do,
would
be
to
act
on
some
application
that
these
gentlemen
might
file
and
believe
me,
there's
no
chance
if
they
will
file
an
application
for
the
setup
they
now
have.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
they
would
have
to
do
--
i
think
they
would
have
to
divest.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
too,
one
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
court
and
get
it
approved,
yes.
the
only
(voice
overlap)
--
the
only
contention
if
i
might
just
answer
that
question.
the
only
contention
that
i
hesitate
in
honestly
to
make
is
that
they
might
get
that
permission
and
i
think
they
might
well
and
i
don't
want
to
--
but
i
think
you
--
one
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
court.
the
point
i
think
is
again,
to
what
the
court
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
i
understood
you,
yes.
excuse
me,
justice
black.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
to
review
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
it
seems
to
me
it's
much
far
limited
than
that.
but
it
said
that
the
case
holds
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
to
order
--
to
review
a
cab
order
which
is
subject
to
the
president's
review
and
that
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction
to
review
it
after
the
president
had
acted
the
point
which
has
--
even
that
point
hasn't
been
squarely
decided.
there
are
many
people
who
think
that
when
the
time
comes,
the
case
should
be
decided
contrary
to
the
dicta.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
in
any
event,
all
of
that
case
deals
with
surely,
is
the
review
of
an
order
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board.
it
doesn't
purport
to
say
that
the
whole
field
of
foreign
air
commerce
is
set
aside
as
one
of
executive
discretion.
the
courts
can't
intervene
and
it
can't
even
intervene
into
it
with
respect
to
a
matter
as
to
which
the
president
plainly
has
no
authority,
this
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
i
may
say
just
one
sentence.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
court's
opinion
must
be
confined
to
matters
over
which
the
president
and
the
cab
have
some
jurisdiction.
mr.
archibald
cox
under
the
civil
aeronautics
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
the
facts
were
limited
to
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
afraid
i
can't
add
to
what
i've
already
said.
mr.
archibald
cox
thank
you.
