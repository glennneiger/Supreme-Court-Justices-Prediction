want
to
be
sure
i
have
the
link
to
each
share

it's

grace
lines.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
it's
a
grace
--
w.r.
grace
and
company
owns
50%
of
panagra
and
pan
am
owns
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
grace
line
is
a
separate
subsidiary
of
w.r.

of
course,
this
long
before
the
days
of

1938.
justice
potter
stewart
it
always
wasn't,
the
federal
aviation
act
is
apparently
new
enactment,
isn't
it
but
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
the
--
but
since
1938,
i
think
those
two
antitrust
extensions
have
been
in
this
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
doesn't
the
record
indicate
that
as
of
now,
the
grace
company
thinks
that
the
future
transportation
in
this
area
lies
on
the
airline
business
rather
than
the
shipping
business?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i'm
not
sure
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
and
yet
when
there
were
only
two,
they
granted
the
--
they
granted
a
certificate
to
a
third
one,
didn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
they
(voice

panagra.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
part.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
judge
peck,
certainly
that's
just
what
the
district
court
did.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
basis
of
finding
that
there
was
a
violation
of
section
2.
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
the
theory
was
that
the
--
that
pan
american
was
exercising
monopoly
power
in
excluding
this
competitor
from
going
into
the
united
states
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
the
district
court's
theory?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
the
district
court's
theory?
justice
potter
stewart
at
that
point
in
the
--
in
that
episode
and
throughout
the
history
of
this
thing,
this
was
hardly
a
combination.
it
was
a
fight
between
two
antagonists,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
certainly
with
reference
to
getting
a
certificate
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
whole
history
that
you've
given
us
shows
that
there
was
an
airline,
an
existing
airline
in
the
east
coast
of
south
america
and
they
are
creating
one
for
the
west
coast,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
they
were.
justice
potter
stewart
pan
american
has
not
been
operating?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
operating
where?
over
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
so
these
were
simultaneous
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
certiorari
was
granted
and
then
later
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
you
got
--
back
in
1928,
this
is
describing
grace's
frame
of
mind
back
in
1928.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
gather
that
you
don't
consider
the
interchange
agreement
in
any
way
even
close
to
an
equivalent
of
--
about
the
certificate
for
panagra.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
also
suggested
that
far
from
a
monopoly,
the
route
from
the
united
states
to
the
canal
zone
is
very
competitive
that
there
are
some
eight
other
carriers
and
that
this
is
an
international
operation
now
because
of
the
geographical
location
of
the
airport
in
panama
rather
than
in
the
canal
zone.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
--
maybe
they're
really
talking
about
different
things.
i
mean,
is
there
only
one
route
from
new
york
to
the
canal
zone,
only
one
carrier
maybe
six
from
miami
to
the
canal
zone
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
all
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
kind
of
ambiguous,
does
the
government
mean
that
the
agreement
--
while
continuing
in
existence
became
illegal
at
least
as
early
as
1938.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
that's
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
is
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
illegal
at
least
since
1938?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
think
that
the
government
has
certainly
--
the
government's
brief
and
the
solicitor
general
this
morning
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
trying
to
persuade
us
that
grace's
ownership
stifles
or
competition
between
--
i'm
coming
to
that
ocean
service
travel
and
air
travel,
both
in
passengers
and
freight.
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
decree
--
did
you
purchase
the
stock
of
panagra
known
by

justice
potter
stewart

pan
american?
