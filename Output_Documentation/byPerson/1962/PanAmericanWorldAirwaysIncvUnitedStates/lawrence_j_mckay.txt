mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
at
the
very
outset,
like
to
make
crystal
clear
what
the
government's
objective
has
been
and
is
against
my
client
w.r.
grace.
it
is
as
the
court
below
observed,
an
effort
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board
and
by
the
department
of
justice
to
compel
a
merger
of
two
american
competing
airlines.
indeed,
the
only
two
american
lines
competing
on
this
route.
this
is,
as
i
submit,
diametrically
opposed
to
the
customary
efforts
of
the
department
of
justice
which
is
to
prevent
horizontal
mergers,
not
to
coerce
them.
the
government
has
plainly
stated
that
it
brought
this
suit
at
the
behest
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board.
now,
the
board
had
two
reasons
for
urging
the
department
of
justice
to
bring
this
suit.
first,
the
board
as
had
grace
and
claimed
for
20
years
by
pan
american's
continued
refusal
to
permit
panagra
to
even
apply
to
the
civil
aeronautics
board
for
the
right
to
come
through
to
the
united
states
in
competition
with
pan
american.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
mr.
justice
black,
the
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
oh
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
douglas.
judge
frank
did
rule
in
our
favor
and
said
that
the
civil
aeronautics
board
could
inquire
into
whether
or
not
the
pan
american
board
of
directors
and
their
stockholders
were
voting
in
fraud
of
the
rights
of
panagra
and
grace.
they
took
a
petition
for
certiorari,
this
court
granted
certiorari.
at
the
same
time,
the
civil
aeronautics
board
put
braniff
in
as
our
competitor
with
access
to
the
united
states.
grace
at
that
time
was
faced
with
continued
litigation,
doubtful
outcome
and
a
competitor
who
is
right
through
for
the
united
states.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
pan
american
after
the
matter
was
entered
into
one
of
the
through
flight
moved
and
had
it
dismissed
on
the
grounds
of
mootness
and
it
was
dismissed.
the
second
reason
that
the
board
had
for
urging
the
department
of
justice
to
institute
this
suit,
was
that
it
recognized
that
it
was
an
error
in
1946,
when
it
certificated
braniff
on
the
expectation
that
there
would
be
sufficient
traffic
to
support
two
carriers.
this
turned
out
not
to
be
the
fact
and
the
civil
aeronautics
board
was
desirous
of
alleviating
the
burden
of
subsidizing
the
loss
of
two
carriers.
so
they
decided
that
these
two
carriers
should
merge.
and
the
suggestion
has
been
made
repeatedly
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board
that
braniff,
the
joining
company
lately
should
not
merge
into
panagra
but
panagra
should
merge
into
braniff
and
permit
braniff
to
be
this
surviving
carrier
solely
because
it
wanted
to
get
rid
of
this
bitter
impasse
that
had
resulted
from
pan
american's
continued
rejection
of
grace's
attempts
to
extend
panagra
into
the
united
states
which
the
board
itself
had
repeatedly
and
urgently
solicited
the
partners
to
cooperate
in
so
doing.
i
submit
that
insofar
as
this
case
is
based
upon
the
desire
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
and
the
department
of
justice,
to
compel
grace
to
divest
itself,
it
is
improperly
found.
the
government,
may
it
please
the
court,
on
the
eve
of
trial
in
1959,
entered
into
a
consent
decree
with
pan
american
and
submitted
the
same
to
the
court
for
its
approval.
under
this
decree,
pan
american
agreed
to
divest
itself
of
its
entire
interest
in
braniff
--
in
panagra
in
favor
of
braniff,
provided
for
reasons
best
known
to
itself
that
grace
could
be
persuaded
or
compelled
to
divest
itself
of
its
interest
in
panagra.
grace
objected
that
district
court
disapproved
--
refused
to
approved.
among
the
reasons
that
grace
objected
to
the
approval
of
the
decree
was
number
one,
it
felt
in
its
opinion
that
it
would
not
give
immediate
and
effective
relief
to
panagra,
to
grace
and
to
the
traveling
public.
further,
grace
felt
that
as
a
pioneer
here,
that
is
one
of
the
people
who
have
fought
vigorously
for
the
rights
of
panagra,
it
should
not
be
requested,
directed
or
ruined
to
give
up
its
interest
in
the
facility
that
it
had
created
along
with
pan
american
but
the
only
one
of
the
two
partners
who
had
fought
for
its
rights
continuously
since
its
organization.
i
submit
that
the
grandfather
provisions
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act,
now
the
federal
aviation
act,
which
confirms
two
pioneer
carriers
that
were
operating
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
act
that
they
shall
have
the
right
to
continue
to
operate
under
the
certificate
from
the
board
prevents,
precludes
any
such
attempted
compulsion
of
a
merger.
the
air
transport
--
the
air
transportation
policy
of
the
united
states
might
or
might
not
be
served
by
such
a
merger.
what
i
submit
is
surely
clear
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
antitrust
laws
upon
which
this
case
is
necessarily
based
which
can
order
grace
to
divest
itself
in
favor
of
a
particular
person,
braniff
or
anyone
else.
i
submit
further
the
--
may
it
please
the
court,
that
insofar
as
this
case
is
based
upon
pan
american's
continued
refusal
to
permit
panagra
to
come
through
to
the
united
states
that
it
has
properly
founded
and
ought
to
prevail.
this
refusal
hasn't
been
impeded
competition,
this
restraint
was
found
by
the
court
as
an
attempt
by
pan
american
to
monopolize
the
segment
of
the
transportation
field
and
it
does
warrant
an
antitrust
remedy.
the
question
is,
what
should
the
remedy
be
and
against
whom
should
it
be
granted,
i
submit
that
the
district
court
properly
found
that
it
should
be
pan
american
that
should
be
divested
or
the
case
should
be
dismissed
as
to
grace.
the
district
court
in
so
finding
and
directing
pan
american's
dive
--
divestiture,
clearly
found
that
there
was
never
any
agreement
between
any
of
the
parties
or
among
any
of
the
parties
that
prevented
panagra
from
applying
coming
to
the
united
states
and
restricting
it
to
routes
south
of
the
canal
zone.
rather
the
district
court
found
that
pan
american
unilaterally
imposed
these
unlawful
restraints
upon
panagra
in
its
attempt
to
maintain
enacting
or
obtain
a
monopoly.
pan
american
itself
has
admitted
this
when
grace
for
the
first
time
in
1938
proposed
to
pan
american
that
panagra
apply
to
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
the
matter
was
discussed
at
a
pan
american
board
meeting.
and
it's
in
the
record
and
the
minutes
clearly
show
that
pan
american
there
determined
that
such
an
expansion
would
not
be
in
the
interest
of
our
stockholders,
namely
the
stockholders
of
pan
american,
not
of
panagra,
to
have
panagra
come
north
in
competition,
in
further
competition
with
pan
american
and
they
have
consistently
maintained
that
position
until
today.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
civil
aeronautics
board
and
i
believe
all
the
air
carriers
were
all
in
agreement
but
an
interchange
is
a
very
poor
substitute
for
one
zone
route.
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
might
point
out
here
that
panagra
is
the
only
american
flag
carrier
that
has
on
its
own
terminal
in
the
united
states.
it
comes
with
the
canal
zone.
it
is
dependent
on
pan
american,
through
flight
going
out
with
pan
american's
route
into
miami
and
to
miami
to
new
york
on
an
interchange
where
its
pilots
and
its
crew
were
taken
off
into
new
york
on
the
national
airline.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
that
is
somewhat
contradictory
of
what
judge
peck
pointed
out.
he
was
relying
on
witnesses
presented
by
pan
american
at
the
trial
that
if
panagra
was
permitted
to
compete
with
pan
american
between
the
canal
zone
and
miami,
pan
american
would
go
out
of
business
because
panagra
would
get
all
the
traffic.
how
would
then
can
it
be
explained
these
eight
other
carriers
that
are
competing
with
pan
american.
why
is
pan
american
still
living?
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
horror
presented
by
pan
american's
witness
at
the
trial,
this
would
not
have
come
about.
pan
american
competes
through
the
world
with
other
carriers
and
i'm
sure
that
she
could
compete
with
panagra.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
there's
a
number
from
miami
and
pan
american
flies
down
from
miami,
new
york-miami
and
into
the
canal
zone.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
(voice
overlap)
international
carriers
carrying
that
local
traffic
that
they
would
be
carrying
to
the
west
coast.
they
would
not
be
going
down
the
west
coast
if
that's
panagra's.
your
honor,
in
an
effort
to
achieve
its
objective
here
against
grace,
the
government
has
disingenuously
devised
a
number
of
arguments.
now,
in
so
doing,
they
not
only
cast
an
antitrust
language
but
they
find
themselves
in
a
number
of
contradiction.
they
argue
on
the
one
hand
that
grace
agreed
with
pan
american
that
panagra
should
not
compete
with
pan
american
and
that
pan
american
shouldn't
compete
with
panagra.
if
the
district
court
found
the
government
does
not
deny
and
in
fact
admits,
that
grace
was
the
only
one
of
the
two
partners
that
fought
and
fought
vigorously
for
panagra's
extension
in
competition
with
pan
american.
another
contradiction
that
the
government
finds
itself
in
is
that
they
say
that
the
affiliation
of
grace
--
grace
line
with
panagra,
restrained
the
development
of
panagra.
yet
on
the
other
hand,
they
attest
to
the
fact
that
panagra
is
one
of
the
leading
airlines
on
the
west
coast
of
south
america.
they
say
that
its
air
cargo
had
been
vigorously
developed
within
the
past
years.
who
did
that?
only
grace
is
operating
panagra
under
the
management
of
agreement
they
entered
into,
certainly
pan
american
is
not
interested
in
developing
panagra,
they
have
done
everything
to
restrain
it
as
the
record
clearly
shows
and
as
the
court
found.
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
see
how
the
government
can
continue
to
argue
this
case
and
support
both
theories,
grace
restrained
panagra
in
favor
of
the
grace
line,
yet
grace
vigorously
fought
for
panagra.
and
panagra
had
as
the
government
claims
maintain
and
ascertain
a
dominant
position.
turning
now
to
the
first
argument
that
the
government
advances
in
this
understanding
of
agreement
between
grace
and
pan
american,
which
they
referred
to
as
this
division
of
territories
in
the
east-west,
the
government
complains
that
grace
and
pan
american
agreed
to
limit
this
fear
of
pan
american
and
panagra.
now,
i
state
that
this
argument
found
is
on
two
grounds.
first,
that
it's
clear
from
the
record
and
i
say
that
the
court
so
found
that
this
agreement
terminated
over
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
and
that
since
that
time,
grace
has
neither
attempted
to
enforce
it
or
indeed
has
even
recognize
it
as
an
existing
agreement.
now,
this
i
say
is
evident
from
grace's
consistent
course
of
action
for
the
past
25
years.
in
answer,
i
believe
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
the
solicitor
general
said
that
the
actions
of
the
parties
then
were
the
same
as
they
are
now
in
connection
with
why
was
he
attacking
the
combination
at
its
creation.
and
he
pointed
and
referred
to
the
fact,
pan
american
was
still
continuing
to
restrain.
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
that
he
had
no
point
mentioned
anything
that
grace
was
doing
since
1938
and
even
prior
to
1938,
this
agreement
,i
submit,
was
perfectly
valid
as
the
district
court
found.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act
in
1938,
as
i
believe
it
has
been
pointed
out,
these
independent
airlines
depended
on
air
mail
contract.
without
them,
you
could
not
operate.
people
tried
it
and
they
were
losing
at
the
rate
of
$40,000
a
month,
which
even
those
days,
was
a
lot
of
money.
these
contracts
were
at
the
periods
of
10
year.
the
post
office
department
and
the
state
department
clearly
defined,
lays
down
as
the
government
admits,
enforced
the
policy
of
a
no
parallel
operating
carrier.
in
other
words,
the
post
office
department
would
not
support
and
the
state
department
would
not
assist
two
carriers
for
the
same
route.
and
this
continued
up
until
1938,
it
was
during
this
period
that
pan
american
and
grace
recognizing
the
economic
impossibility
of
competition
as
the
district
court
found
that
they
did
not
move
into
the
other
territory.
number
one,
they
couldn't
because
there
would
be
no
air
mail
contract
for
them.
two,
they
would
not
have
the
assistance
of
the
state
department.
and
it
is
this
agreement
upon
which
the
government
is
resting
its
case
and
saying
that
it
continued
as
far
as
grace
is
concerned,
it
never
continued.
immediately
in
1938,
with
the
passage
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act,
grace
pressed
for
an
expansion
of
panagra.
we
not
only
pressed
that
its
route
be
extended
coming
north.
we
pressed
that
they'd
be
extended
going
east.
we
asked
pan
american
to
agree
to
permit
panagra
to
go
into
rio
and
sao
polo,
they
refused.
they
have
recognized
this
agreement.
they
have
maintained
that
it
continues
to
exist.
and
we
state,
it
terminated
in
1938
when
its
validity
terminated
as
the
government
itself
said
in
a
jurisdictional
statement
filed
in
this
court,
the
agreement
ceased
to
be
valid
no
later
than
1938.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
yes,
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
i'll
give
you
today
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
in
other
words,
the
government
contends
the
agreement
is
continuing.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
but
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
that
is
correct.
they
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
because
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
i
make
the
argument,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
this
agreement
was
legal
and
lawful
while
competition
was
economically
impossible.
that
was
up
to
1938.
since
1938,
pan
american
has
persistently
refused
to
commit
panagra
to
extend
its
routes
in
competition
with
pan
american.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
well,
i
respectfully
submit,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
the
record
here
is
replete
with
instances
that
pan
american
has
shown
itself
to
be
such
a
persistent
and
consistent
violator
of
the
law,
of
the
antitrust
laws
here.
despite
the
fact
that
the
civil
aeronautics
board
on
at
least
four
or
five
occasions,
requested
pan
american
to
permit
panagra
to
even
apply.
they
have
refused.
and
it's
so
clear
mr.
justice
goldberg,
from
the
record
from
their
own
minutes
that
they
will
never
permit
panagra
to
become
an
effective
competitor
with
pan
american
as
long
as
they're
in
there.
i
think
it
is
the
only
--
i
agree
with
the
district
court
that
it
is
the
only
really
effective
relief
that
can
be
granted
for
a
persistent
violator
--
a
violator
of
the
antitrust
laws
which
has
continued
since
1938.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
no.
the
testimony
mr.
justice
goldberg,
before
the
civil
aeronautics
board
by
the
general
counsel
and
vice-president
of
pan
american,
by
the
president
of
panagra,
under
oath,
they
both
testified
and
they
assisted
in
the
drafting
of
that
that
there
was
no
agreement
in
the
through
flight
agreement
which
prevented
either
panagra
or
grace
requesting
an
extension
of
panagra's
routes
north.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
mr.
justice
goldberg,
in
1948,
we
worked
under
the
through
flight
agreement.
the
matters
were
in
a
period
of
suspense.
we
were
looking
at
the
matter.
we
made
additional
applications
for
it.
in
fact,
we
have,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
think
about
three
applications
pending
now
for
panagra.
we
refiled
an
application
on
behalf
of
panagra,
we
asked
pan
american
again
to
join
in.
i
think
it
was
1950
but
it's
within
the
--
or
maybe
1954.
we
applied
on
behalf
of
panagra,
pan
american
again
refusing.
we
filed
with
the
cab
a
petition
asking
the
cab
to
look
into
the
fraud
and
illegality
of
pan
american
in
accordance
with
the
second
circuit
decision.
that
matter
has
been
pending
as
the
latin
american
route
case
until
this
case
comes
to
a
final
decision.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
there
are
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
that
is
correct.
they
have
been
pending
now
for
i
believe
five
or
six
years.
this
case
started
i
believe
it
was
in
january
or
february
1954.
your
honor,
i
--
your
honors,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
government
here
has
not
sustained
its
case
against
grace.
when
it's
relying
upon
an
agreement
that
went
out
of
existence,
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago,
the
record
shows
that
grace
has
not
recognized
or
attempted
to
enforce
in
the
past
25
years
ever
since
the
enactment
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act
and
when
during
the
period
of
its
existence,
i
submit,
it
was
valid.
that
is
the
government's
case
against
grace,
as
far
as
this
agreement
is
concerned,
this
division
of
territory.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
i'm
coming
to
that
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
wasn't
referring
that
this
was
the
government's
case
against
grace
on
the
division
of
territory
argument.
i'm
coming
now
to
their
other
argument
that
there
was
something
inherent,
unlawful
of
grace
owning
a
hundred
percent
of
a
steamship
company
to
go
into
the
air
business
and
take
a
50%
interest.
now,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
district
court
was
absolutely
correct
when
it
found
that
in
this
particular
case,
panagra
and
the
grace
line
did
not
comprise
part
of
the
same
market.
this
is
--
i
think
it's
obvious
from
a
mere
appreciation
of
what
is
panagra
and
what
is
grace
line.
pangara
is
essentially
a
carrier
of
passengers,
whereas
this
is
the
most
insignificant
part
of
grace
line's
business.
even
more
important,
is
that
the
few
passengers
that
grace
line
carries
are
not
prospective
customers
of
panagra.
and
i
think
this
is
evident
from
these
two
pieces
of
thought
which
we
find
in
the
record
and
they
relate
to
the
time
consumed
and
the
cost
of
the
travel.
prior
to
the
institution
of
getting
the
service,
it
took
a
passenger
on
panagra
from
new
york
to
santiago
21
hours,
on
the
grace
line,
21
days.
taking
another
point,
new
york
to
panama,
it
took
10
hours
by
panagra,
six
to
seven
days
on
the
grace
line.
now,
the
record
shows
that
there're
equally
rate
differences
in
the
course.
on
panagra,
the
tourist
fare
from
new
york
to
santiago
was
$414.
on
grace
line,
the
minimum
fare
during
the
winter
season
is
$645,
on
the
off
season,
$595
and
down
to
$545.
so
you
have
these
differences
of
cost.
you
have
21
hours
as
the
record
shows
against
21
days.
now,
if
one
is
much
quicker
and
cheaper
than
the
other
mean,
why
is
it
that
anyone
goes
on
the
grace
line?
i
submit
that
the
only
answer
is
that
they
want
the
experience
and
perhaps
the
relaxation
of
a
notion
voyage.
that
is
something
that
panagra
does
not
and
cannot
offer.
the
government
takes
the
position
that
well,
vacation
may
be
torn
between
flying
down
to
the
argentina
and
spending
six
weeks
there
as
against
taking
six
weeks
sea
voyage.
but
i
submit
if
that
is
what
to
--
we
are
to
regard
as
compromising
the
same
market,
you
have
to
put
in
this
very
market,
hotels
in
the
caribbean,
lodges
up
in
and
out
because
the
vacation
--
he's
looking
at
that,
he's
looking
at
everything
in
his
vacation
folder.
turning
quickly
your
honor
to
the
manner
of
the
freight
that
the
solicitor
general
argued
at
such
great
length,
again,
it's
important
i
think
to
consider
how
much
does
grace
line
carry
as
against
panagra.
in
1958,
grace
line
carried
almost
1
million
tons,
panagra,
3000
tons.
the
fact
that
panagra's
service
needs
that
the
steamship
company
cannot
meet.
i
think
there's
evidence
from
the
comparison
of
the
rates.
the
general
commodity
rate
on
panagra
for
2000
pounds
moving
from
new
york
to
santiago
is
$1660;
on
the
grace
line,
$90.
now,
it's
obvious
that
even
if
there
were
some
fluctuation
in
the
prices
here,
they
could
not
by
any
means
get
close
enough
together
whether
it'd
be
a
matter
of
difference
to
a
shipper
as
to
whether
head
ship
on
the
grace
line
or
on
panagra.
and
i
submit
that
it's
unlikely
that
these
rates
will
change
to
any
large
degree
because
the
rates
are
based
largely
on
the
cost
involved.
and
the
record
will
show
that
the
cost
of
carrying
freight
on
panagra
or
cargo
service,
from
july
1957
to
january
1959
was
$35.06
per
ton
mile,
while
in
the
1958,
on
the
grace
line,
it
was
only
6
tenths
to
7
tenths
of
1
cent
per
ton
mile.
now,
with
that
great
difference
in
cost,
one
cannot
expect
that
there's
going
to
be
any
change
in
rate,
at
least
any
significant
change
to
make
the
$1660
charge
somewhat
compatible
with
a
$90
charge
on
the
grace
line.
the
solicitor
general
during
the
course
of
his
argument
relied
upon
the
testimony
of
a
few
witnesses
presented
by
pan
american
as
to
whether
they
compete
with
steamship
companies.
i
could
have
told
your
honors
what
the
testimony
would
have
been
before
the
gentleman
talked.
because
pan
american
has
usually
referred
to
the
grace
people
as
they
both
have.
they
have
no
love
for
their
partner
who
had
put
them
in
this
difficult
situation
by
asking
that
panagra
be
extended
in
competition
with
them.
but
i
think
perhaps
the
best
witness
to
rely
upon,
is
the
government's
own
witness
which
the
solicitor
general
did
not
quote,
and
he
testified
as
follows.
bear
with
me
just
a
moment.
the
vast
majority
of
export
freight,
tons
in
ton
miles
would
have
commodities
that
could
not
possibly
have
been
carried
by
airplane.
and
he
further
testified,
steamship
rates
on
quantity
movement
are
far
below
attainable
cost
for
moving
freight
by
air
in
the
foreseeable
future.
your
honor,
i
see
that
my
time
is
running
out
but
i
do
want
to
refer
to
the
solicitor
general
reading
from
various
isolated
documents
in
the
record.
wholly
with
age
back
in
the
early
1930s,
these
believe
me
were
selected
documents.
we
have
filed
a
reply
and
you
will
find
that
document
from
grace
officials
attesting
to
the
fact,
instructing
the
employees
down
the
line
that
they
are
to
be
completely
impartial.
in
fact,
there
was
one
letter
cited
by
the
government
which
was
answered
and
contradicted
that
that
was
not
in
their
brief.
we
have
pointed
it
out
in
our
brief.
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
say
that
here,
we
have
a
clear
picture
of
w.r.
grace
who
has
attempted
to
promote
and
in
fact
has
promoted
the
interest
of
panagra.
it
has
met
with
the
opposition
of
pan
american.
the
district
court
has
ordered
the
divestiture.
in
fact,
the
district
court
has
permitted
grace
to
file
an
additional
application
on
its
own
that
we
are
in
the
burden
that
if
pan
american
is
not
divested
that
is
reversed,
that
application
must
be
withdrawn.
we
do
have
our
other
applications
pending
as
i
mentioned
to
mr.
justice
goldberg
(voice
overlap)
on
the
fraud
and
illegality
point.
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
that
would
be
subject
to
cab
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
mckay
--
approval
mr.
justice
stewart,
because
of
the
acquisition
of
additional
control
if
we
went
out
on
quite
additional
fact
over
and
beyond
50.
we
can
only
do
it
if
the
cab
determined
that
it
was
in
the
public
interest.
well,
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
in
view
of
grace's
conduct
throughout
which
has
been
consistent,
not
deny,
subject
to
findings
of
the
court
that
it
alone
has
promoted
the
interest
of
panagra
that
this
paper
case
the
government
attempts
to
make
out
of
us
--
out
against
us
on
the
basis
of
a
few
isolated
documents,
some
30
years
ago,
over
30
years
ago
should
not
prevail
and
the
evidence
against
pan
american
is
clear,
uncontradicted,
in
fact
admitted.
and
that
they
should
be
divested
on
the
case,
dismissed
against
grace.
thank
you.
