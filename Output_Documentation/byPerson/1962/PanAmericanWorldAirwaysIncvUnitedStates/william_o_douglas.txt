just
--
justice

that
that

shall
be
divided

what
the
overall
competitive
picture
is
with
airlines
like
killeen
--
as
i
remember
killeen?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice

foreign
carriers
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
thank
you.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
didn't
you
win
that
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit?
justice
william
o.
douglas
douglas
was
the
name.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
the
case
was
dismissed
here,
i
think.
