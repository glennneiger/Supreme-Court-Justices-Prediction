justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
if
in
this
case,
the
transcript
to
the
reporter's
notes
had
been
available
when
they
were
requested
in
1957,
1958,
whenever
it
was.
why
couldn't
the
court
have
refused
that
transcript
even
though
the
notes
were
available
on
the
grounds
that
the
defendant
or
the
petitioner
had
not
pursued
his
remedies
at
the
time
of
his
trial
or
right
after
his
trial
had
not
requested
a
free
transcript
then?
i
don't
know
why.
i
mean
if
your
reason
is
--
if
you're
--
if
the
ground
you're
relying
on
is
good
for
one
thing
or
that
would
be
good
for
another.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
apparently
relying
in
this
case
upon
the
--
upon
the
failure
of
the
petitioner
to
request
from
the
judge
a
transcript
back
in
the
time
of
his
trial,
aren't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
constitutionally,
you
are
saying
that
failure
to
request
at
an
earlier
time
when
the
opportunity
was
available.
constitutionally,
that's
an
adequate
answer
to
his
request.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
if
illinois
wanted
its
part
of
its
rules
say
that
we
will
grant
these
transcripts,
delayed
--
this
delayed
request
for
transcripts
in
cases
where
the
petitioner
has
asked
for
and
was
refused
a
transcript
at
an
earlier
dates,
illinois
could
constitutionally
do
that.
that
would
be
your
contention.
