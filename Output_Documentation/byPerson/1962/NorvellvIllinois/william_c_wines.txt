mr.
william
c.
wines
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
sullivan
has
stated
the
facts
of
the
case
fairly
and
accurately
as
he
invariably
does.
however,
i
think
that
i
can
best
present
illinois's
argument
by
restating
those
facts
in
the
focus
of
the
questions
from
the
bench
and
distinguishing
those
facts
from
those
in
the
cases
upon
which
the
petitioner
chiefly
relies
in
this
argument.
petitioner,
whose
race
is
not
so
far
as
i
know
shown
by
the
record,
was
indicted
for
murder
in
1941
with
two
other
defendants,
pleaded
not
guilty,
waived
trial
by
jury,
was
tried
by
the
bench
and
was
found
guilty
of
murder.
he
was
represented
at
that
time
by
counsel
employed
and
paid
by
his
family.
its
not
disputed
at
least
to
this
juncture
of
the
case
that
the
employment
of
counsel
exhausted
petitioner's
funds.
he
then
made
informal
inquiry,
perhaps
even
request
of
the
official
court
reporter
of
cook
county
or
one
of
them
for
a
gratuitous
transcript,
what
it
was
then
called
and
still
is
called
in
an
illinois
criminal
case,
a
bill
of
exceptions
without
charge.
so
far
as
the
record
shows
and
so
far
as
it's
contended,
the
only
effort
that
petitioner
made
in
1941
to
obtain
a
free
transcript
which
request
the
court
before
the
court.
he
made
no
application
of
any
kind
to
any
court
for
any
kind
of
an
order
that
would
entitle
him
to
that
transcript.
some
fifth
--
in
april
of
1956,
the
23rd
i
believe
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
so
far
as
i
know,
there
was
no
representation
to
any
judge
of
any
court
in
1941.
the
trial
court,
any
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
a
federal
court
or
any
other
court,
that
he
was
a
pauper,
that
he
was
indigent.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think
that
is
true.
mr.
william
c.
wines
now,
he,
as
i
say,
made
no
effort
in
1941.
eight
years
later,
mr.
e.h.
allen,
the
court
reporter,
died.
mr.
sullivan
is
correct,
mr.
e.h.
allen
was
a
venerable
court
reporter
in
cook
county
for
many
years,
it
is
considered
--
not
only
in
this
case
but
in
many
others,
many
others.
everybody
tells
a
state's
attorney
and
the
attorney
general
that
nobody
can
read
the
notes
of
e.h.
allen
in
any
of
his
cases.
with
his
death,
they
became
insoluble
cryptograms,
a
dead
script.
among
such
cases
was
the
case
of
william
highlands
which
has
been
through
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
another
seven
years
and
a
few
months
went
by,
and
in
april
of
1956,
your
honors
decided
griffin
against
illinois.
promptly,
upon
the
announcement
of
the
opinion
in
that
case,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
promulgated
its
rule
65-1.
that
rule
gives
free
transcripts
or
authorizes
at
least
the
giving
of
free
transcripts
to
prisoners
who
were
indigent
at
that
time
of
their
conviction,
if
they
make
application
before
march
1st,
1957.
petitioner
made
such
an
application.
he
obtained
an
order
from
judge
crowley,
directing
that
he
be
given
a
free
transcript
of
his
proceedings.
it
then
developed.
perhaps
it
had
been
previously
suspected
but
it
then
developed
with
certainty
that
was
not
--
it
was
impossible
to
transcribe
the
notes
of
mr.
e.h.
allen.
thereupon,
petitioner
brought
this
proceeding
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
elicited
the
opinion
and
judgment
to
which
review,
which
your
honors
have
granted
to
this
court
certiorari.
now,
i
should
like
to
contrast
this
case,
the
case
upon
which
petitioner
chiefly
relies,
eskridge
against
washington
prison
board
357
u.s.
214,
decided
in
1958.
the
opinion
is
per
curiam.
because
of
certain
passages
in
the
reply
brief,
i
should
like
to
ask
the
chief
justice's
permission
to
read
less
than
half
page
of
this
opinion
so
i
won't
--
i
can't
possibly
misrepresent
what
is
in
it.
your
honors
say
at
the
bottom
of
pages
--
page
214
and
the
top
of
page
215.
in
1935
after
petitioner,
now
that's
petitioner
eskridge
in
washington,
was
convicted
of
murder
in
a
washington
state
court
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
he
gave
timely
notice
of
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state,
end
of
that
quotation.
it
appeared
that
he
was
indigent
and
washington,
the
supreme
court
of
washington
held
that
your
honors
didn't
intend
the
griffin
case
to
be
retrospect
just
how
the
washington
court
could
achieve
that
in
conclusion,
i
don't
know,
but
it
did
and
it
declined
to
give
mr.
eskridge
a
transcript.
now,
the
court
says
at
page
216,
“the
state,”
that's
the
state
of
washington,
“the
state
concedes
that
the
reporter's
transcript
from
the
1935
trial
is
still
available.”
in
other
words,
all
that
your
honors
did
in
this
unanimous
per
curiam
case
in
the
eskridge
case
was
make
the
state
of
washington
what
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
did
promptly
upon
the
announcement
of
the
griffin
case
in
the
issuance
of
the
mandate,
rule
65-1
was
then
drawn.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right,
but
as
of
the
present
time
barring
some
such
anomalous
cases
raises
a
different
question.
you
must
get
your
bill
of
exceptions
certified
within
100
days.
it
was
50
days
in
1941
or
any
extension
obtained
within
that
hundred
days
and
there's
no
limit
on
the
length
of
the
extension,
except
you
must
get
each
one
before
the
last
one
expires.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
never
know
of
one
that
was
granted
but
i
never
know
one
that
was
applied
for.
i
really
don't
know.
i
don't
handle
criminal
cases
in
the
trial
court
and
i
do
know
this
and
i'll
concede
it,
that
nobody
would
have
--
it
wasn't
done.
how
often
it
was
applied
for
and
denied,
i
don't
know.
how
often
if
ever
it
was
applied
for
and
granted,
i
just
don't
know,
but
i
will
tell
the
court
that
it
was
certainly
not
a
common
practice.
now
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
is
your
honor
through
with
the
question?
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
so
far
i'm
narrating
the
facts,
but
to
answer
your
honors
first
question
as
i
understand
it,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
promulgated
rule
65-1
which
gave
convicted
persons
transcripts
even
though
they
hadn't
requested
and
the
time
to
request
them
--
request
them
would
otherwise
have
expired.
the
--
let
me,
let
me
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
say
that
that
would
be
an
adequate
answer
showing
--
absent
some
showing
that
he
was
prevented
from
requesting
it
which
wouldn't
necessarily
mean
that
coercion
by
guards
might
be
mental
infirmity
or
something
of
this
sort.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
would
be
my
contention,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
and
there
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
yes.
yes,
indeed,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
don't
know
of
any
case
where
a
request
was
made
within
--
would
otherwise
have
been
the
time.
again,
i
just
don't
know,
but
as
far
as
i
know
there
were
no
such
cases.
now,
if
the
court
please,
rule
65-1
does
contain
a
provision
which
raises
no
question
here
but
i'll
inform
the
court
of
it,
that
rule
by
the
way
is
set
forth
at
appendix
page
7
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
it
does
provide
that
you
must
specify
the
alleged
errors
which
the
petitioner
claims
occurred
at
his
trial
and
that
he
desires
to
apply
for
issuance
of
a
writ
of
error
to
review
the
conviction
but
petitioner
did
that.
he
complied
that
--
with
that
and
we
don't
say
that
he
didn't.
and
he
obtained
an
order
for
a
transcript
under
rule
65-1,
but
rule
65-1
contains
this
provision
which
occurs
at
page
8,
“in
the
event,
the
court
finds
it
is
impossible
to
furnish
petitioners
to
know
stenographic
transcript
for
the
proceedings
of
his
trial
because
of
the
unavailability
of
the
court
reporter,
who
reported
the
proceedings
and
the
inability
of
any
other
court
reporter
to
transcribe
the
notes
of
the
court
reporter
who
served
at
the
trial
or
for
any
other
reason
the
court
shall
deny
the
petition.”
of
course,
all
that
does
is
recognize
what,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
so
principally
said,
is
an
impossibility.
there's
really
nothing
gained
--
it
makes
no
--
by
granting
a
petition
that
mounts
only
where
a
rule
on
a
man
who
is
dead
and
buried
to
transcribe
his
notes.
now,
eight
--
now,
15
years
after
his
conviction
and
more
than
seven
years
after
the
death
of
mr.
allen,
petitioner
made
application
under
rule
65-1
and
obtained
this
order
for
a
free
transcript.
the
notes
could
not
be
transcribed
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
as
i
say,
wrote
the
opinion,
it's
now
here
for
review.
now,
at
this
--
the
second
case
upon
which
petitioner
principally
relies
is
the
westbrook
case
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
arising
in
illinois.
in
the
westbrook
case,
westbrook
was
not
a
pauper.
there
may
be
an
inadvertent
statement
in
illinois
brief
that
he
was.
he
wasn't
a
pauper.
within
the
hundred
days,
he
requested
a
bill
of
exceptions
and
he
offered
to
pay
for
it.
and
he
got
several
extensions.
the
reason
he
didn't
get
it
was
that
the
reporter
developed
multiple
sclerosis,
left
the
state
and
refused
to
transcribe
anything
for
anybody,
no
matter
how
much
he
was
paid.
there,
timely
application
had
been
made,
had
been
persisted
here.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
says
in
this
statement
quotation
is
criticized
in
petition
of
reply
brief
here,
that
westbrook
“filed
a
timely
notice
of
appeal.”
actually,
that's
inaccurate
because
notice
of
appeal
isn't
ordinarily
used
and
until
recently
couldn't
be
used
in
illinois.
what
you
filed
was
a
press
for
a
writ
of
error.
well,
the
court
--
petitioner's
counsel
takes
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
to
pass
for
this
inaccurate
statement.
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
meant
is
correct
that
he
evinced
the
record
his
desire
for
a
transcript
within
the
time
provided
for
him.
he
didn't
make
a
showing
of
poverty
because
he
wasn't
a
pauper
but
he
did
come
up
with
money.
now,
in
that
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
did
say
that
--
and
they
relied
on
the
timeliness
of
the
application
that
in
that
case
sits,
it
wasn't
possible
to
grant
a
timely
application
or
a
report
of
proceedings.
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
a
new
trial
and
illinois
did
seek
certiorari.
now,
in
the
instant
case,
the
situation
is
that
petitioner
made
no
effort
for
15
years
to
obtain
a
free
transcript.
mr.
william
c.
wines
1956.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
the
court
reporter
didn't
die,
there
was
a
transcript
available.
mr.
william
c.
wines
in
the
monroe
case,
there
was
a
transcript.
many
of
our
court
reporter's
transcripts
can
be
read
by
any
reporter.
at
least
so
the
reporter
tells
us
and
everybody
believes
him.
mr.
william
c.
wines
15
years
delay
plus
intervening
impossibility.
that
is
our
contention.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
i
think
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
white
of
course
not
to
rule
but
to
suggest
that
illinois
could
have
taken
the
position
that
absent
of
showing
in
a
particular
case
of
mental
retardation,
something
in
that
sort
if
you
didn't
make
timely
application
in
1941,
you
can't
make
it
now.
but
i
don't
have
to
argue
that
because
the
illinois
didn't
take
that
position.
mr.
william
c.
wines
what?
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
say
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
forget
rule
65-1
for
a
moment
as
though
it
had
never
been
promulgated,
that
in
1941,
petitioner
willie
norvell
could
have
done
exactly
what
griffin
and
his
co-defendant
crenshaw
did
in
19
--
shortly
before
1956.
he
could
have
gone
before
--
the
judge
before
whom
he
was
convicted
or
any
other
judge
at
the
criminal
court.
he
could
have
asked
for
a
transcript.
it
might
have
been
denied.
he
could
have
taken
his
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
there's
no
presumption
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
wouldn't
have
respected
the
constitutional
amendment.
that
this
petitioner,
in
other
words,
could
have
done
in
1941
exactly
what
griffin
did
shortly
before
1956,
made
his
application,
timely
application,
taken
his
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
if
he
suffered
defeat,
sought
this
court's
writ
of
certiorari.
if
griffin
was
the
law
in
1941,
presumably
this
court
would
have
said
so
in
1941.
if
it
wasn't
the
law
in
1941,
presumably
this
court
wouldn't
have
said
so.
now
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think
it
was.
your
honors
just
hadn't
said
so
yet
and
presumably
would
have
said
so
if
--
if
some
previous
convicted
person
such
as
norvell
had
brought
this
case
here.
now,
i'm
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
say
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
a
little
more
than
that.
a
little
more
than
that
but
just
in
amplification
and
this
is
what
i
say
in
amplification.
that
one,
if
we
look
at
it
realistically,
one
who
seeks
appellate
review
of
a
conviction
of
a
crime
is
like
anybody
else
who
has
to
prove
a
fact,
only
this
time
instead
of
having
to
prove
what
actually
happened
at
state,
in
monroe,
in
chicago,
he
has
to
prove
in
order
to
get
a
review,
what
a
witness
said
happened
there.
the
best
evidence
of
that,
not
necessarily
the
only
evidence
but
the
best
evidence
of
that
is
ordinarily
an
authenticated
transcript
of
a
record.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
there
--
the
evidence
on
that
is
there's
not
only
no
evidence
that
they
can
be
done
but
there's
pretty
conclusive
evidence
that
it
cannot
be
done.
now,
so
the
fifth
of
my
argument
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
which
also
proves
that
the
state
can't
be
tried.
the
fifth
of
my
argument
is
this,
as
a
matter
of
fourteenth
amendment
due
process,
never
mind
some
greater
right
that
illinois
may
choose
to
give,
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
getting
up
a
record
when
a
convicted
man
waits
15
years
and
then
seeks
it.
i'm
so
anxious
to
make
this
point.
while
i'm
arguing,
it's
conceivable
that
some
court
reporter,
some
place
in
the
united
states
is
dying
right
this
minute.
now,
talk
about
unreasonable
classifications.
does
a
man
suddenly
get
a
right
to
a
new
trial
as
soon
as
his
court
reporter
dies?
whether
that
is
15
years
or
20
years
afterwards,
now
it's
different
when
he
goes
within
--
with
reason
--
i'm
talking
due
process
now,
not
the
appellate
--
canons
of
appellate
judicature
of
illinois
or
any
other
particular
state
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
my
answer
is
that
if
he
has
waived
an
unreasonable
length
of
time,
he
should,
that
a
convicted
person
shouldn't
be
able
to
bet
his
own
life
expectancy
against
that
of
the
court
reporter
in
effect.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
i
wouldn't.
i
say
that
it's
--
that
when
--
that
when
we
get
to
fourteenth
amendment
due
process,
it's
a
matter
of
reasonableness.
reasonableness
is
the
defining
ingredient
of
due
process
in
all
cases
and
i
say
that
it
might
very
well
be
that
in
the
hypothetical
case
that
mr.
justice
white
puts,
that
this
man
who
has
got
the
transcript
would
wish
to
heaven's
sake
that
it
was
his
court
reporter
who
died
because
he
might
get
an
affirmance
and
the
other
fellow
say,
“well,
you
can't
presume
that
the
record
in
my
case
was
like
his
and
he
would
get
the
new
trial.”
i
say
that
for
a
reasonable
time
and
that
time
should
usually
be
the
time
fixed
by
the
rules
of
the
state.
100
days,
60
days,
3
months,
2
months,
if
the
court
reporter
dies
and
there's
no
real
way
to
reconstruct
it,
the
defendant
should
get
a
new
trial.
but
otherwise,
if
you
can
raise
it
anytime
then
every
time
a
court
reporter
dies,
it
operates
as
a
pardon
for
everybody
whose
trial
is
transcribed
if
his
notes
can't
be
read
and
if
they
can't
--
and
if
they
can't
be
transcribed.
now,
as
to
this
question
as
to
how
many
cases
are
pending
as
to
how
many
cases
are
filed
in
illinois,
i
don't
know.
i
haven't
had
anything
like
the
information
that
mr.
sullivan
had
for
mr.
justice
goldberg.
as
to
how
many
prisoners
there
are,
whose
notes
were
transcribed
by
e.h.
allen,
i
have
no
information.
as
to
how
many
prisoners
there
are
in
the
other
49
states,
convicted
anywhere
from
10
days
to
40
years
ago,
whose
reporters
have
died,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
think
that
the
death
of
a
court
reporter
ought
to
act
not
just
as
a
pardon
but
as
a
general
active
amnesty
to
everybody
whose
notes
--
whose
case
he
transcribed.
mr.
william
c.
wines
it
certainly
would,
it
certainly
would.
i
would
not
want
to
be
a
court
reporter
under
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
beg
your
honor's
for
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
i
wouldn't
want
to
comment
on
that
for
fear
i
might
offend
our
group
libel
statute
that
your
honors
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
upheld.
mr.
william
c.
wines
thank
you.
mr.
william
c.
wines
and
equal
protection.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think
it
was
made
better
by
mr.
justice
harlan's
single
question
that
was
by
my
half
hour.
but
when
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
counsel,
“does
illinois
deny
equal
protection
when
it
does
discriminates
between
the
possible?”
that
is
the
case
where
the
court's
reporter
is
alive
or
his
notes
can
be
otherwise
transcribed
and
the
impossible
that
is
where
he's
dead
or
has
multiple
sclerosis.
i
think
this
that
--
i
really
think
that
these
petitioners
who
have
waited
a
long
time,
what
they
need
is
a
witness
to
what
happened.
if
the
court
reporter
is
dead,
the
best
evidence
is
gone.
if
nobody
else
is
around
and
nobody
can
prove
it,
it's
just
a
question
who
has
the
burden
of
proof,
20
years
later
that
due
process
was
denied
in
1941.
the
man
who
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
beg,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that
the
court
has
said
that
you
don't
have
to
allow
appellate
review
of
any
kind.
but
that
if
you
do,
you
can't
deny
it
on
a
basis
of
race,
property,
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
wish
your
honor
would.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
your
honor.
that
case
that
you
will
put
as
a
hypothetical
is
exactly
the
actual
griffin
case.
griffin
had
no
counsel
any
place
until
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
appointed
counsel
for
him.
he
and
crenshaw,
they
were
co-defendants.
they
took
their
case
in
forma
pauperis
proceed
from
the
criminal
court
of
--
i
think
it
was
cook
county
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
sought
certiorari
here.
now,
in
the
(inaudible)
case
your
honors,
sustained
the
conviction
where
court-appointed
counsel
appealed
and
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
within
five
days
and
that
was
the
capital
case.
i
say
that
their
--
that
the
situation
is
if
this
wasn't
the
law
in
1941
which
i
think
it
was
then
norvell
wasn't
entitled
to
it.
and
if
he
was
if
he's
properly
claimed
it,
it's
presumed
that
he
would
have
gotten
it.
because
he
has
made
no
allegation
that
anything
kept
him
from
applying
in
that
time.
