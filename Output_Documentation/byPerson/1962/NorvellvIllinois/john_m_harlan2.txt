justice
john
m.
harlan
up
today
--
up-to-date
this
is
all
pre-griffin?
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
put
--
if
i
get
your
argument
correctly,
to
put
it
crudely,
you're
saying
that
it's
an
unreasonable
classification
for
the
state
to
distinguish
between
the
possible
and
the
impossible?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
isn't
--
isn't
that
the
substance
of
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
neither
of
which
events
was
attributable
to
any
fault
on
the
part
of
the
state?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh
naturally
--
naturally.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
anything
to
indicate
or
is
it
possible
to
say
without
the
transcript
what
kind
of
trial
errors
the
client
would
assert
if
he
had
an
appeal
--
if
he
didn't
have
an
appeal?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
view
of
your
state
rule,
post-griffin
rule,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
he
knew,
whether
he
waived,
whatever
happened
back
in
1950,
in
1941?
under
the
rule
he's
entitled
on
a
showing
of
indigency
to
get
the
transcript
as
i
read
the
rule.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
only
question
then
is
whether
or
not
the
provision
in
the
rule
that
says,
the
state
will
not
do
what
i
call
the
impossible
is
a
constitutional
provision.
is
that
permissible
--
permissibly
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--constitutional
provision?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
but
the
rule
is
construed
by
your
court
is
that
he
gets
now
relief
which
i'd
assume,
binds
us,
meaning
that
he
doesn't
have
to
get
a
new
trial.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
they
reached
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
as
the
law
we
have
to
take
is
a
state
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
reason
i
am
raising
this
question
is
to
talk
about
waiver
and
not
waiver
whether
he
had
a
lawyer
or
whether
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer,
whether
he
made
a
representation
to
--
that
he
was
or
was
not
indigent.
i
don't
see
what
bearing
all
that
has
on
--
in
view
of
the
existence
of
this
rule
in
your
state.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
can
understand
what
mr.
wines
argued
because
it's
kind
of
appealing
ad
hominem
point.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
i
should
think
from
your
point
of
view
you
would
say
that
you
can
accept
everything
that
mr.
wines
said
and
still
stand
on
your
present
rule
and
then
argue
from
that
premise.
