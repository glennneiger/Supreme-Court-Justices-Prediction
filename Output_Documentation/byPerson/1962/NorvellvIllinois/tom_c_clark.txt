justice
tom
c.

i
see
in
these
defendants
to
petitioner's
brief,
a
case
called
a
monroe
case
that
a
sentence
was
imposed
in
the
year
1936
and
the
griffin
case
was
in
what?
1956?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
the
illinois
court
reversed
and
remanded
in
1958?
justice
tom
c.
clark
how
do
you
explain
that
case?
is
that
different
from
this
one?
justice
tom
c.
clark
there
was
one
case.
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
your
point
is
not
what
you
just
said
that
the
15
years
delay
is
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
of
course,
it
wasn't
the
law
when
griffin
was
convicted.

happens
