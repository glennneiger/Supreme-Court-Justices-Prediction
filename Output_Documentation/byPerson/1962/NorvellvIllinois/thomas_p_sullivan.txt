mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
honorable
members
of
the
supreme
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
it
comes
here
as
an
aftermath
to
the
case
of
griffin
against
illinois
in
351
united
states.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
a
convicted
defendant
whose
poverty
has
precluded
him
from
obtaining
appellate
review
and
therefore
prevented
the
trial
proceedings
that
were
begun
against
him
from
being
completed
is
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
these,
the
petitioner
willie
norvell
was
an
18-year-old
colored
boy
in
1941.
he
and
his
brother
james
and
his
brother-in-law
edgar
shepherd
were
indicted
for
murder.
the
petitioner
at
that
time
and
at
all
times
between
then
and
now
was
indigent
and
have
no
money,
whatever.
however,
his
family
retained
counsel
to
represent
him
at
the
trial.
the
defendants
waive
trial
by
jury
and
were
trying
before
a
judge
in
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county.
the
--
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
all
three
defendants
were
found
guilty.
petitioner,
willie
norvell,
was
sentenced
to
199
years
in
the
illinois
state
penitentiary.
the
other
two
defendants
were
each
sentenced
to
50
years
imprisonment.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
mr.
norvell's
family
no
longer
had
funds
with
which
to
retain
counsel
and
counsel
did
not
represent
him
at
any
time
between
1941
at
the
end
of
the
trial
and
1961
when
i
was
appointed
to
represent
him
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
nor
did
the
family
have
any
money
with
which
to
buy
the
trial
transcript
which
as
your
honors
know
this
is
necessary
in
order
to
present
a
case
to
the
illinois
supreme
court,
a
criminal
case
in
illinois.
nevertheless,
efforts
were
made
by
the
petitioner
to
determine
the
cost
of
a
transcript.
an
order
was
entered
in
the
trial
court
extending
the
time
within
which
the
transcript
could
be
filed
and
certified
but
--
and
this,
your
honors,
is
undisputed
in
the
records,
solely
because
the
petitioner
had
no
funds.
solely
because
he
was
a
pauper,
he
was
unable
to
obtain
the
transcript
in
1941.
the
time
expired
for
the
certification
of
the
transcript.
he
went
down
to
jail
to
begin
the
service,
199
years
sentence.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
all
1941,
and
mr.
--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
so
far
as
this
record
shows,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
was
no
representation
made
to
the
court
in
1941
of
his
indigency.
he
was
represented
at
the
trial
and
the
record
we
have
doesn't
show
that
they
talked
about
pauperism
or
wealth
or
poverty.
he
was
convicted.
a
judge
who
was
entered
against
him,
the
sentence
was
imposed
and
that's
the
last
thing
we
have
other
than
an
order
extending
the
time
for
filing
the
transcript
for
90
days.
in
other
--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned,
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
that
shows
that
the
trial
court
in
cook
county
knew
that
norvell
was
a
pauper
in
1941.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record.
there
is
a
provision
and
was
at
that
time
in
illinois
law
that
the
trial
judge
could
order
a
transcript
to
be
prepared
at
state's
expense,
but
there's
nothing
on
the
record
to
show
that
the
court
was
informed
that
norvell
was
a
pauper.
is
that
--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
no
request
made
then.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
your
honor's
decision
in
griffin
against
illinois
of
course
was
not
speaking
just
as
of
1956
when
that
case
was
decided
but
the
court
held
that
illinois
always
was
under
a
constitutional
obligation
to
do
that.
now
--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
well,
your
honor,
i
would
answer
that
in
this
two-fold
fashion.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
that
the
state
of
illinois
will
concede
today
that
if
in
1941
the
court
was
informed
that
the
man
was
indigent
and
did
ask
for
a
transcript,
that
transcript
would
not
have
been
granted.
it
would
have
been
denied.
secondly,
when
in
1956,
the
illinois
supreme
court
on
remand
in
the
griffin
case
wrote
its
rule
to
comply
with
griffin.
they
stated
that
everyone,
whenever
convicted,
should
be
given
a
free
transcript
and
no
distinction
was
drawn
as
to
whether
or
not
a
request
had
been
made
by
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
his
trial
or
conviction.
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
classification
that
has
been
established
by
the
state
of
illinois.
now,
the
outcome
of
that
classification
is
arbitrary,
capricious
and
unconstitutional.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
the
--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
the
rule
provides,
your
honor,
that
if
the
defendant
who
is
--
who
was
tried
before
the
griffin
decision,
files
a
petition
in
the
court
in
which
he
was
convicted
before
a
certain
date
and
states
that
he
was
a
pauper
at
the
time
of
his
conviction
and
is
still
a
pauper,
then
he
is
to
be
given
a
free
transcript.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
well,
of
course
the
court
--
i
assume
the
court
could
hold
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
the
statements
in
his
petition
are
true.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
well,
it
might
be,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
it
indicates
--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
that
--
that
may
be,
your
honor.
it
might
be
hard
to
determine
it
but
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
did
file
such
a
petition
after
the
griffin
case
was
remanded
and
that
rule
was
written.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
there
was
an
order
entered
by
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county
finding
that
he
was
indigent
in
1941
and
still
indigent.
and
he
himself
testified
in
the
proceedings
held
in
1961
and
testified
to
that
fact
when
there
is
no
dispute
about
that
in
the
record
whatsoever.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
and
i'm
also
referring
to
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
himself
in
1961
appearing
at
page
42
of
the
record
which
said,
“i
did
not
have
a
penny
at
the
time
of
my
trial
from
the
time
i
went
down
the
stateville
in
1941
until
today
i
have
not
had
any
money,”
except
for
a
few
dollars
that
he
got
from
being
a
guinea
pig
in
some
of
these
injection
matters
that
they
have.
in
1956,
going
back
now
to
the
facts,
if
the
court
please.
in
1956,
this
court
decided
the
griffin
case
and
as
i
have
stated,
illinois
--
then,
the
illinois
supreme
court
promulgated
its
rule
65-1,
providing
that
those
convicted
before
the
griffin
case
could
obtain
a
free
transcript
if
they
filed
a
verified
petition
in
the
trial
court
containing
certain
allegations.
mr.
norvell,
the
petitioner
here,
filed
such
a
petition
in
1956.
the
--
an
order
was
entered
directing
the
court
reporters
to
prepare
the
transcript.
it
was
found
that
a
full
transcript
was
necessary
in
order
to
present
to
a
reviewing
court
the
errors
that
he
stated
were
made
at
the
trial.
nothing
further
was
done
in
the
case
between
1956
and
1961
when
i
was
appointed
to
represent
mr.
norvell
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
at
that
time,
upon
checking
into
the
matter,
we
discovered
that
two
reporters
were
present
at
the
time
of
his
trial
and
one
of
them
had
died
in
1949.
hearings
were
then
held
in
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county,
and
as
a
result
of
those
hearings,
the
following
facts
appear
without
any
contradiction
in
this
record.
half
of
the
transcript
of
the
1941
trial
is
missing,
including
all
of
the
state's
proof
and
sheet.
there
are
approximately
200
to
250
pages
of
actual
transcript
that
are
--
were
contained
in
the
deceased
reporter's
notebook.
further,
no
one
can
read
the
notes
of
this
deceased
reporter.
efforts
have
been
made
not
only
in
this
case
but
in
a
prior
case,
the
oscar
bragg
case
in
which
i
represented
mr.
bragg
and
it
was
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
twice
to
construct
--
to
read
the
notes
of
mr.
e.m.
allen.
efforts
were
made
throughout
the
country
to
find
a
court
reporter
who
could
translate
these
notes
and
we
were
not
successful.
so
that
we
have
the
facts
in
this
record,
half
of
the
transcript
is
missing,
there
notes
are
eligible
and
we
called
witnesses
back,
all
the
witnesses
we
could
from
the
1941
trial
to
try
to
reconstruct
the
missing
portions
of
the
trial
and
none
of
these
people
could
recall
the
testimony
that
had
been
given
back
in
1941
at
that
trial.
so
that
we
have
half
of
the
record,
including
none
of
the
state's
case
and
sheet,
whereupon
we
moved
for
a
new
trial.
the
motion
was
denied,
we
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
the
court
unanimously
affirmed
the
order
denying
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
the
cases
before
this
court
on
certiorari
raising
issues
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution.
it
is
our
position,
if
the
court
please,
in
this
case
that
the
legal
proceedings
which
were
begun
against
mr.
norvell
in
1941
have
never
been
completed.
in
the
griffin
case,
this
court
recognized
that
appellate
review
has
now
become
an
integral
part
of
the
illinois
trial
system
for
finally
adjudicating
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
a
defendant.
and
that
to
deny
appellate
review
to
the
poor
means
that
many
of
them
may
lose
their
life,
liberty
or
property
because
of
unjust
convictions
which
appellate
courts
would
set
aside.
the
petitioner
here
has
never
had
that
appellate
review.
his
conviction
may
be
unjust.
not
only
has
he
never
had
the
appellate
review
which
is
guaranteed
to
him
by
the
constitution
and
the
laws
of
illinois,
he
never
can
have
it
insofar
as
his
1941
trial
is
concerned.
the
approximate
cause
of
this
situation
is
two-fold,
i
believe.
it
is
first
that
in
1941,
illinois
unconstitutionally
failed
to
make
available
to
paupers,
convicted
of
crime,
free
transcripts
of
the
trial
or
some
other
means
by
which
they
could
obtain
review.
and
then
we
have
the
continuance
of
that
situation
until
the
state's
official
reporter
died
in
1949
and
it
has
been
discovered
that
the
state's
official
reporter
took
a
system
of
shorthand
notes
that
no
one
now
can
read.
therefore,
there
is
no
question
about
that,
if
mr.
norvell
had
had
funds
in
1941,
he
would
have
been
able
to
obtain
review
of
his
conviction.
because
he
had
no
funds,
he
could
not
do
it
and
now
he
can
never
do
that.
we
think
not
only
that
illinois
violated
mr.
norvell's
rights
in1941
when
he
was
convicted
but
also
that
the
classification
that
has
been
established
by
illinois
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
illinois
--
the
illinois
supreme
court
as
i
mentioned
earlier
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question
has
ruled,
in
there
ruled
and
written
in
response
to
this
court's
opinion
in
the
griffin
case,
that
any
person
who
was
convicted
before
the
griffin
case,
is
entitled
to
a
free
transcript
if
he
files
a
petition
setting
up
certain
facts
within
a
certain
time
and
mr.
norvell
did
that.
what
we
have
here
as
the
thing
has
worked
out
is
that
illinois
says,
“we
will
grant
relief
to
you
if
your
court
reporter
is
still
alive
or
if
he
is
dead
if
he
took
a
legible
system
of
notes.”
we
submit
that
this
classification
of
granting
review
to
all
persons
except
those
who
had
--
court
reporters
who
died
in
the
interim
and
who
took
a
system
of
shorthand
notes
that
cannot
be
read
is
more
arbitrary
and
capricious
than
granting
--
than
denying
review
to
persons
who
are
poverty
stricken.
and
because
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
griffin
case,
the
state
does
not
cause
a
person
to
become
poor
but
--
and
perhaps
the
defendant
himself
has
--
by
his
wastefulness
has
brought
about
his
poverty.
but
how
can
mr.
norvell
be
charged
with
the
help
of
the
state's
official
court
reporter
or
the
way
in
which
he
took
notes
back
in
1941.
we
say
that
if
illinois
as
it
has
applies
the
griffin
rule
retrospectively,
it
must
do
so
without
regard
to
whether
the
court
reporter
who
took
notes
if
the
trial
is
still
alive
and
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
that
court
reporter
used
the
system
of
shorthand
which
cannot
be
read.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
that
is
one
way
of
putting
it,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
i
think
that
it
should
be
put
this
way.
they
say,
“we'll
give
you
a
transcript
if
we
can.”
that's
about
the
size
of
it
and
i
say
that
that's
an
unreasonable
classification
when
you
ask,
“but
why
can't
you
give
mr.
norvell
a
transcript?”
and
the
only
reason
you
can't
do
it
is
because
his
reporter
is
dead
and
he
didn't
use
a
legible
system
of
notes.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
nor
is
it
attributable,
your
honor,
to
any
fall
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
however,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
illinois
had
granted
mr.
norvell
his
full
constitutional
rights
in
1941
this
problem
would
not
have
arisen.
so
that
to
the
extent
there
is
fault,
the
fault
lies
with
the
state
and
there
is
no
fault
lying
with
the
defendant
in
the
case,
the
petitioner
here.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--
the
citation
to
the
illinois
statute
is
--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--
in
the
statement
of
facts
in
our
brief.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
granting
a
new
trial
to
a
person
whose
trial
transcript
has
been
become
unavailable
in
a
criminal
case
is
the
routine
relief
granted
by
courts
throughout
the
united
states.
we
have
cited
many
cases
in
our
brief
from
courts
all
over
the
united
states
in
which
new
trials
have
been
granted
to
convicted
defendants
where
the
trial
transcript
is
unavailable
and
therefore
appellate
review
is
not
possible.
the
reason
of
course
is
that
the
reason
for
the
foreclosure
of
appellate
review
is
not
ascribable
to
the
defendant.
he
will
be
deprived
of
an
important
right
and
integral
part
of
the
trial
system.
and
in
order
that
an
injustice
not
be
done
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
proceedings
cannot
be
completed,
the
proceeding
is
started
all
over
again.
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
clyde
castle
case
cited
in
our
brief
recently
granted
a
new
trial
to
a
convicted
defendant
who
was
unable
to
obtain
a
transcript
for
appeal.
we
say
that
if
mr.
castle
is
entitled
to
a
new
trial
under
these
circumstances,
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
that
mr.
norvell
likewise
be
granted
a
new
trial.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
they
did
not
advert
to
the
norvell
case.
i
should
correct
myself,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
castle
case
was
decided
before
the
norvell
case.
the
opinion
in
the
castle
case
was
not
published
and
it
was
not
called
to
my
attention
until
after
i
had
submitted
my
briefs
in
the
illinois
supreme
court.
so
i
did
not
confront
them
with
the
conflict.
but
it
was
shortly
before
they
decided
the
norvell
case,
so
presumably
they
had
it
in
mind
when
they
wrote
the
opinion.
castle
was
convicted
after
the
griffin
case,
norvell
before
him.
perhaps
that's
the
ground
of
distinction
--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question,
if
the
court
please,
about
the
fact
that
review
is
needed
in
illinois.
we
have
cited
in
an
appendix
to
our
brief
the
many,
many,
many
cases
that
have
been
reversed
in
illinois
solely
as
a
result
of
this
court's
opinion
in
the
griffin
case.
there
are
over
50
case
since
1956
in
which
convictions
has
been
thrown
out
entirely
or
gross
error
has
been
found
at
the
trial
and
the
court
has
determined
that
appellate
review
was
necessary.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
there's
only
this,
your
honor.
the
defendant
made
a
confession
apparently
and
that
confession
is
part
of
the
record
in
this
case
and
that
confession
starts
at
page
21
of
the
trans
--
of
the
record.
and
that
was
introduced
against
them
at
the
trial.
a
motion
to
suppress
the
confession
was
made
by
the
defendant.
we
don't
have
the
hearings
on
the
motion
to
suppress
but
at
page
20
of
the
transcript,
the
trial
judge
said
this
to
the
state's
attorney
at
the
conclusion
of
the
state's
case.
i
want
to
state
the
situation
for
the
record,
this
is
at
page
20.
if
the
confessions
as
to,
as
to
two
of
these
boys
are
stricken,
there
is
no
testimony
whatsoever
against
them
outside
of
the
verbal
statements
if
there
are
any
in
the
record
that
incriminate
these
boys.
and
then
the
state's
attorney
says,
well
as
to
willie
norvell,
who's
the
petitioner
here,
he
thinks
that
officer
negrin
(ph)
testified
through
an
oral
confession
and
the
judge
said,
“well
he
didn't
he
remember
it
but
we
better
--
we'll
talk
about
it
when
we
talk
about
the
motion
to
suppress
on
monday.”
so
the
trial
judge
was
concerned
about
the
adequacy
of
the
proof.
i
don't
know
what
the
ground
of
the
motion
to
suppress
was.
i
don't
know
what
any
of
the
evidence
was,
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
this
is
the
kind
of
a
case
where
appellate
review
might
be
necessary
and
if
it
--
if
we
have
the
whole
record,
we
may
find
that
the
confession
was
unlawfully
obtained
from
this
18-year-old
moronic-negro
boy
back
in
1941
and
that
the
entire
conviction
would
form.
i
just
don't
know.
the
--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
yes.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
yes,
your
honor.
it
so
happens
that
i
have
become
very
familiar
with
this
problem.
and
mr.
wines
and
i
in
1958
argued
against
each
other
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
westbrook
case
which
is
much
discussed
in
the
brief.
it
happens
that
i
was
appointed
to
represent
charles
westbrook,
oscar
bragg,
willie
norvell
here
and
i
also
represent
a
man
named
claude
dickerson,
who
--
who
however
paid
me
a
fee,
my
only
criminal
fee
case.
so
far
as
i
know,
there
are
five
such
cases
in
illinois.
one
is
the
case
mckee
pending
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
undoubtedly
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
mckee,
it's
cited
in
my
brief.
another
is
the
leodis
smart
case,
pending
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
awaiting
the
out
case
--
outcome
of
this
case.
the
third
is
the
claude
dickerson
case,
whom
i
represented
mr.
dickerson.
he
was
paroled
and
withdrew
his
writ
of
error
from
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
the
fourth
is
the
oscar
bragg
case
cited
in
these
briefs,
mr.
bragg
died
pending
the
appeal
to
the
illinois
supreme
court.
that
case
presumably
would
have
been
argued
here
instead
of
this
case
if
he
had
lived.
the
fifth
is
the
westbrook
case
which
mr.
wines
and
i
argued
against
each
other
in
1958
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
mr.
westbrook
has
been
granted
a
new
trial
and
had
been
released.
those
are
the
only
cases
that
i
know
about.
they
talk
about
a
mass
exodus
from
the
jails
throughout
the
country.
i
don't
think
it's
true.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
these
one
and
two
others
--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
well,
this
one
and
the
mckee
and
the
smart
case,
three,
one
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
one
waiting
here
and
this
one.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
your
honors,
i
have
concluded
my
opening
argument.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
your
honor.
as
i
understand
the
argument
of
the
state
of
illinois,
it
is
in
short
that
the
petitioner
here
should
not
be
given
any
relief
solely
because
at
the
time
he
was
tried,
he
did
not
ask
that
he
be
given
a
transcript
of
the
trial
without
payment
of
cost.
now,
it
may
be
that
this
court
will
hold
that
the
griffin
case
does
not
extend
retrospectively
to
those
who
did
not
request
transcripts,
as
mr.
wines
points
out
the
eskridge
case
involved
the
person
who
did
ask
for
a
free
transcript,
although
he
didn't
raise
a
constitutional
point
in
that
regard.
however,
when
this
--
when
the
griffin
case
went
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
itself
resolved
that
issue
for
illinois.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
your
honor,
i
say
as
did
mr.
wines,
that
if
the
transcript
cannot
be
prepared,
there's
no
point
in
having
an
order
directing
that
it'd
be
prepared.
the
rule
doesn't
say
what
shall
happen
if
this
case
arises.
if
the
transcript
can't
be
prepared,
the
petition
shall
be
denied.
the
question
here
is
whether
a
new
trial
should
thereupon
be
granted
and
this
rule
does
not
expressly
state
or
even
by
implication
that
no
other
relief
should
be
granted.
the
illinois
supreme
court
looked
at
this
question
of
waiver,
they
looked
at
this
question
of
whether
we
should
hold
it
against
the
man
that
he
didn't
make
an
application
back
in
1941
or
whenever
he
was
tried
and
they
said
this,
“we
have
considered
the
applicability
of
the
doctrine
of
waiver,
it
could
be
held
that
a
prisoner
who
did
not
request
a
free
transcript
within
the
time
has
waived
his
right
but
waiver
assumes
knowledge
and
we
are
unwilling
to
hold
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
prisoners
have
been
waived.”
it
is
the
same
notion
that
this
court
expressed
several
weeks
ago
in
the
noia
case.
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
waiver
there
must
be
an
intelligent,
knowing,
giving
up
of
a
right.
that's
the
very
same
thing.
now
illinois
has
said
we
will
not
hold
it
against
you
indigent
defendants
but
at
the
time
you
were
convicted
you
didn't
apply
for
a
free
transcript
or
raised
a
constitutional
question.
therefore,
in
the
final
analysis,
the
only
difference
between
mr.
monroe,
whom
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
out,
was
convicted
some
years
before
norvell.
the
only
difference
between
monroe
and
norvell
is
that
monroe's
court
reporter
is
still
alive
or
that
the
reporter
being
dead
he
wrote
an
eligible
system
of
shorthand.
we
say
that
to
deny
relief
solely
because
of
that
circumstance
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
norvell
was
just
as
prompt
in
seeking
relief
as
monroe.
norvell
did
nothing
to
cause
this
reporter
to
die
or
the
transcript
to
be
lost,
yet
he
cannot
obtain
review
under
the
present
circumstances
and
monroe
did.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
well
--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
don't
think
rule
65-1
says
if
the
--
if
the
transcript
cannot
be
supplied,
the
prisoner
shall
be
sent
back
to
jail
without
further
relief.
the
rule
leaves
open
the
question
of
what
relief
should
be
granted
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
well,
your
honor,
they
did
not
reach
this
result
based
on
a
construction
of
the
rule
but
rather
--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
they
reached
it
based
upon
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
yes,
and
that
is
precisely
the
rule
which
i
am
appealing
from
and
saying
it
creates
an
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
classification.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
i
concur,
your
honor.
i
don't
understand
why
mr.
wines
stands
before
you
and
argues
waiver,
argues
that
you
should
hold
it
against
norvell
that
he
didn't
ask
for
a
transcript
when
the
state
of
illinois
has
already
said
that
they
won't
do
that
as
to
any
of
these
men
and
that
that
is
not
a
ground
for
discrimination
or
distinction.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
but
it
--
i
suggest,
your
honor
that
it
is
not
a
proper
argument
in
light
of
the
opinion
on
the
griff
--
the
illinois
supreme
court
on
remand
in
griffin
and
of
the
text
of
the
rule
that
we
have
before
us.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
just
one
last
point
in
--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
that
is
the
opinion
on
remand
in
the
griffin
case
in
the
illinois
supreme
court,
9
illinois
2d
164.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
on
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
yes.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
it
is,
i
agree
with
that
judge.
i
certainly
do.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
that
is
correct
and
i
might
add,
your
honor,
that
appendix
b
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
i
have
included
a
much
more
complete
list
with
many
more
cases
as
a
result
of
further
research.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
thank
you,
your
honor.
thank
you.
