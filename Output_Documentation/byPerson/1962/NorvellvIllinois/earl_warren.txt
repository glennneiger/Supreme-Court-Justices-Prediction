illinois.
mr.
sullivan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
was
--
how
was
that
represented
to
the
court,
his
indigency
at
that
particular
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
well,
how
would
they
--
assuming
that
griffin
does
apply
as
of
that
date,
how
could
it
be
expected
that
the
court
would
know
that
he
was
indigent
and
that
he
was
in
need
of
a
free
transcript,
and
that
the
court
should
have
given
him
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
yes.
i
was
just
wondering
what
effect
that
would
have
on
all
prisoners
who
are
in
prison
at
the
present
time
but
who
before
griffin
made
no
representation
to
the
court
as
to
indigency
at
all
and
no
transcript
was
given
to
them.
no
request
made
for
a
transcript.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
could
the
state
be
at
fault
in
not
providing
a
transcript
under
those
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
that
isn't
the
point
i'm
making.
the
point
i'm
making
is
this.
why
would
--
how
would
the
state
be
charged
by
not
giving
a
transcript
to
a
person
because
he
was
indigent
if
there
was
no
representation
made
to
the
court
that
he
was
an
indigent
and
that
he
needed
the
transcript
and
wanted
one,
a
free
transcript
because
of
his
indigency?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
was
--
was
there
anything
in
that
order
to
say
that
he
was
entitled
to
it
regardless
of
his
indigency?
chief
justice
earl
warren
regardless
of
his
indigency?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
merely
states
that
fact
now,
not
whether
he
doesn't
make
--
it
depends
on
whether
he
was
at
that
time
a
pauper.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it'd
be
pretty
hard
after
20
years,
wouldn't
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
point
out
whether
the
man
was
indigent
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
when
he
had
a
--
when
he
had
a
paid
lawyer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
you
correctly
to
say
that
even
in
1941
the
judge
--
trial
judge
was
empowered
to
grant
a
free
transcript
if
he
desired
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
sullivan,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may,
you
may
preserve
your
time.
mr.
wines.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
we
get
to
that
mr.
wines.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any,
any
representation
to
the
court
in
1941
that
he
was
an
indigent?
i
understand
he
was
represented
by
paid
counsel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it'd
be
--
and
as
i
understood
from
mr.
sullivan,
the
illinois
law
at
that
time
did
give
the
trial
judge
the
discretion
to
grant
a
free
transcript
if
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sullivan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sullivan,
before
you
sit
down,
i
would
like
to
express
the
appreciation
of
the
court
to
you
for
your
representation
of
this
indigent
defendant
at
the
request
of
your
own
supreme
court
and
doubly
so
because
you
have
apparently
done
it
for
a
number
of
other
indigent
defendants.
that's
a
splendid
public
service
and
our
court
is
very
appreciative
of
it.
and
mr.
wines,
we're
very
appreciative
of
course
of
the
fair
and
earnest
way
in
which
you
always
represent
the
state
of
illinois
in
these
cases.
