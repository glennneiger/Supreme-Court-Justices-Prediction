justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
i
understand
that
these
--
do
you
think
that
either
those
two
cases
overruled
international
harvester
statement
that
as
the
sale
take
place
in
the
state
even
though
it's
to
be
delivered
out
of
the
state,
it
can
be
taxed
by
the
state
--
by
the
state
of
the
carrier?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
be
delivered
in
another
state
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
was
--
he
was
to
do
that.
that
was
understood
all
the
time
and
that
what
which
was
levied,
was
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
may
i
ask
you
just
one
more
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
this
is
very
important
point
to
me.
in
the
international
harvester,
mr.
justice
douglas
said
the
wood
preserving
corporation
case
indicates
that
it's
immaterial
to
the
present
issue
that
the
goods
ought
to
be
transported
out
of
indiana
immediately
on
delivery.
has
that
been
changed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
irrelevant,
so
that
it
can
be
taxed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
(voice
overlap)
--
i
evidently
overlooked
some
--
not
understood
some
of
your
statement.
i
understood
the
other
side
and
i
looked
to
the
contrast,
the
amendment
say
that
these
have
made
in
that
state
to
be
delivered
there
and
that's
the
only
ones
they
attack,
those
that
were
delivered
there
and
to
stay
inside
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
difference
in
that
in
the
wood
preserving?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
was
not
relevant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
irrelevant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
he
not
complete
the
delivered
this
fob
at
his
foundry,
these
things
that
are
attacked
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
won't
ask
anymore.
i
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
mean
that
they
don't
always
pay
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
deliver
it
to
them,
that
they
don't
owe
you
the
money
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
when,
from
what
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
were
lost
on
the
way,
would
that
relief
the
purchaser?
they've
delivered
the
fob
purchase.
if
that's
lost
on
the
way,
transported
to
the
other
state,
who's
lost
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
technically.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
buyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
because
you
bought
it,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
has
been
delivered
to
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
transaction
is
over
so
far
as
they're
concerned
with
reference
to
the
establishment
of
liability
for
the
purchase
of
the
goods?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
furnished
its
sole
wisdom
with
agreement
to
deliver
fob
at
the
furnish
that
it
has
really
not
delivered,
it
hadn't
completed
the
transaction,
and
it
still
got
to
see
that
gets
through
them
at
the
other
end
before
the
other
company
is
liable.
