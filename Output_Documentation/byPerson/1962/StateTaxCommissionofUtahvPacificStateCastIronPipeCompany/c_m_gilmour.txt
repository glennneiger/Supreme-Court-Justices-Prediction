mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
no
quarrel
here
with
the
general
proposition
that
a
fully
consummated
local
sale
to
a
purchaser,
resident
or
non-resident,
who
with
or
without
the
knowledge
of
the
seller
merely
intends
then
or
thereafter
to
transport
the
goods
out-of-state,
that
is
not
the
question
in
this
case.
here,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
utah
as
the
state
of
the
seller
may
levy
and
impose
a
direct
tax
on
the
--
on
the
unapportioned
gross
receipts
of
an
interstate
sale.
now,
the
situation
here
on
the
facts
is
that
the
court
has
specifically
held
on
the
facts
that
this
is
an
interstate
sale.
the
petitioner
itself
at
the
hearing
specifically
found
that
all
of
the
goods
here
have
been
negotiated
by
the
companies
out-of-state
sales
agents.
and
that
they
were
purchased
for
use
in
the
specific
sizes
and
lengths
called
for
by
the
engineering
specifications
covering
the
particular
waterworks
or
sewerage
project,
and
were
strictly
inconformity
with
those
--
with
those
specifications.
so
the
--
under
the
facts,
under
those
two
facts
as
found
by
the
petitioner
and
the
additional
facts
as
they
were
found
by
the
supreme
court
and
our
procedure
there
it's
a
certiorari
under
which
the
supreme
court
has
authority
to
review
the
decision
on
both
the
law
and
the
facts.
and
the
supreme
court
of
our
state
held
that
if
this
pipe
has
had
been
conceded
and
admitted
had
gone
by
a
common
carrier,
that
there
would
have
been
no,
no
tax
payable
here.
now,
under
the
company's
system
of
pricing
pipe,
it
is
on
a
basis
of
delivered
price
to
the
job
site.
the
way
these
things
come
up
el
jebel
or
the
town
of
littleton
may
have
a
water
project.
and
the
engineer
will
get
the
plans
and
specifications
in
great
detail
with
blueprints
and
the
material,
the
pipe
material
for
that
job
is
specifically
prescribed
in
those
engineering
plans
and
specifications.
then
the
pipe
company
knowing
when
this
job
will
come
up
for
bid,
will
ascertain
the
names
of
all
of
the
contractors
that
are
proposing
to
bid
of
that
job.
the
pipe
company
will
then
give
a
delivered
price
quotation
on
that
specific
job.
the
quotation
will
be
tied
right
into
the
job,
it
will
name
the
job,
it
will
list
in
detail
the
exact
sizes
of
pipes
and
fittings,
the
prices
delivered
at
the
job
site
and
identify
that
quotation
to
that
particular
job.
now,
the
--
that
the
pricing
system
in
this
industry
is
a
little
unusual
by
reason
of
the
nature
of
the
product,
all
quotations,
all
prices
are
given
to
the
customer,
delivered
at
the
specific
point
of
use,
and
in
each
individual
sale
and
quotation
of
pipe,
the
--
the
company
computes
a
price
in
the
light
of
the
competitive
conditions
that
it
will
face
at
that
particular
point
of
use.
the
--
those
prices
are
and
quotations
are
given
to
all
these
contractors
that
bid
and
then
thereafter,
the
--
the
pipe
is
either
shipped
to
the
customers
by
--
on
a
freight
prepaid
basis.
the
bulk
of
course
of
the
--
of
the
pipe
is
sold
and
delivered
by
common
carrier
or
in
remote
areas
it
is
delivered
by
the
respondent's
own
trucks.
these
--
yes?
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
yes.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
that's
right.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
that
particular
quotation
is
then
signed
by
him.
when
he
is
the
successful
bidder,
it's
forwarded
to
provo
at
the
home
office,
and
it
is
approved
there
and
that
constitutes
the
--
that
part
of
the
contract.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
yes.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
that's
right.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
by
the
home
office
and
approved
by
the
home
office.
now,
we
--
this
case
is
unique
not
only
on
the
basis
of
the
facts,
but
here
the
bulk
of
this
tax
--
the
bulk
of
these
sales
have
been
subjected
to
tax
in
the
state
of
destination.
now,
in
the
case
of
colorado,
the
pipe
company
of
course
is
qualified
to
do
business
there
and
has
it
has
sales
office
there,
and
on
all
of
these
sales
that
go
over
to
colorado
either
by
customer
truck
or
by
a
common
carrier,
the
respondent
collects
that
tax
from
the
purchaser
and
remits
it
periodically
to
the
--
to
the
state
of
colorado
department
of
revenue.
now,
the
evidence
was
that
in
the
case
of
wyoming,
new
mexico
and
arizona
that
the
customers
have
paid
taxes
down
there
that
was
not
really
controverted
at
the
hearing,
it
was
the
testimony
of
the
company
that
those
taxes
were
paid.
we
didn't
call
in
these
witnesses,
the
dozens
upon
dozens
of
contractors,
but
we
did
have
mr.
clyde
who
was
there,
and
he
testified
that
the
taxes
down
in
arizona
were
--
were
included.
and
he,
in
his
testimony,
meant
not
only
that
they
were
included,
but
that
they
were
paid
down
there
in
arizona
on
that
grand
canyon
project.
now,
the
only
--
the
only
sales
that
where
no
tax
was
paid
to
the
--
to
the
state
of
destination
were
those
sales
into
idaho
and
into
montana
which
at
the
present
time
do
not
have
any
sales
or
use
tax.
the
testimony
being
that
the
--
and
it
was
the
question
of
time
in
idaho
but
that
in
the
last
legislature,
the
governor
had
vetoed
the
passage
of
the
sales
and
use
tax
there.
now,
we
read
--
yes?
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
yes.
as
i
mentioned,
we
have
in
these
tax
cases
out
in
utah,
the
hearings
are
conducted
by
the
state
tax
commission
which
has
an
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
them.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
that's
correct
and
has
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
we
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
that
--
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
the
--
we
had
raised
the
interstate
commerce,
the
due
pro
--
pro
--
process
because
the
sale
is
in
two
states
and
it
was
negotiated
out.
we
had
raised
the
equal
protection
point
because
of
the
irrational
discrimination
between
the
--
the
mere
means
of
transport.
we
had
raised
the
point
that
under
the
regulations,
the
tax
was
not
payable
because
the
goods
went
across
the
state
as
an
essential
part
of
the
sale,
and
under
contracts,
it
legally
obligated
the
seller
to
get
the
goods
to
the
out-of-state
job
site.
but
the
court
ruled,
as
we're
assuming
here,
that
the
tax
was
invalid
under
the
commerce
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
and
left
unanswered
--
these
other
--
these
other
questions.
and
the
court,
i
think
in
reading
its
opinion,
found
that
on
the
facts,
these
were
inters
--
interstate
sales.
and
utah
being
state
of
the
seller
was
prohibited
from
levying
a
tax
on
them
and
that
is
certainly
borne
out,
i
might
turn
to
the
--
to
the
cases,
the
law
applicable
here.
we
rest
squarely
on
the
adams
manufacturing
company
case,
the
gwin,
white
case,
and
the
freeman
against
hewitt
case
which
specifically
hold
that
the
state
of
the
seller
cannot
tax
the
--
levy
a
direct
tax
on
the
unapportioned
gross
receipts
of
the
inter
--
interstate
sale.
now,
as
a
matter
of
interest
and
going
back
a
little
bit
in
history
and
as
assistance
to
the
court,
i
might
point
out
the
sequence
here
at
--
it
has
long
been
settled
that
state
of
destination,
state
of
market,
the
place
where
the
property
is
to
be
used
is
the
state
that
has
the
primary
claim
for
the
tax
here.
now,
there
were
some
earlier
cases
involving
motor
fuels
but
in
1937,
this
court
in
henneford
case
held
at
washington
could
levy
a
use
tax
on
the
goods
that
were
shipped
into
the
state
of
washington.
in
1938,
the
adams
manufacturing
case
followed
which
held
at
the
state
of
the
seller
could
not.
and
the
western
livestock
came
in
1938
hold
--
which
brought
in
a
principle
of
the
multiple
levies.
and
in
gwin,
white
in
1939,
again
reaffirmed
the
adams
manufacturing
that
the
--
that
the
tax
on
the
state
of
the
seller
was
invalid.
and
in
1940,
the
berwind-white
case
was
decided
which
upheld
the
right
of
new
york
city,
the
state
of
the
buyer
to
levy
a
sales
tax.
now,
the
case
is
--
the
wood
preserving
case
was
in
1941,
and
the
international
harvester
case
which
is
a
fully
consummated
type
of
transaction
in
intention
case
was
in
1944.
now,
freeman
against
hewitt,
although
it
had
been
first
argued
in
1944,
was
reargued
in
this
court
in
1946.
at
the
same
time
that
the
richfield
oil
case,
some
10
days
or
two
weeks
afterwards,
and
the
freeman
against
hewitt
is
in,
is
in
3
--
volume
329
of
the
reports
of
249,
richfield
oil
at
page
69.
so
freeman
against
hewitt
is
a
later
case,
then
the
richfield
oil
by
a
matter
of
days.
the
rich
--
the,
the
freeman
against
hewitt
reaffirmed
again
the
principle
that
the
state
of
the
seller
cannot
levy
the
tax
and
the
reason,
and
what
we
have
involved
here
essentially
is
the
historic
distinction,
if
not
continental
divide
between
two
types,
between
adams
manufacturing
and
the
grin,
white
and
on
the
other
side
is
the
henneford
and
the
berwind-white.
now,
commentators
in
the
law
reviews
say
like
gnats
buzzing
over
a
bowl
of
fruit
have
attempted
to
analyze
these
various
decisions.
is
the
tax
bad
by
reason
that
isn't
apportioned?
is
the
tax
bad
because
it's
a
direct
tax?
is
the
tax
bad
because
it
imposes
the
risk
of
multiple
taxation?
it
is
unnecessary
here
to
pursue
those
various
interesting
theories
because
the
cases
have
in
holding
--
in
actual
holdings
hold
that
a
direct
tax
on
the
unapportioned
gross
receipts
of
an
interstate
sale
is
bad
and
invalid.
now
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
international
harvester,
mr.
justice
black
is
--
has
not
been
overruled.
it's
--
it
stands
for
the
proposition
that
a
fully
consummated
local
sale
where
the
non-resident
comes
in
indiana
and
purchases
indiana
goods
from
an
indiana
seller
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
well,
he
transported
it
--
he
transported
under
the
stipulated
facts
that
were
involved
in
that
case,
he
took
title,
he
took
delivery,
and
then
he
thereafter
transported
those
goods
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
under
--
under
the
--
under
the
stipulated
facts
there
the
--
it
was
--
it
was
clear
that
the
contract
between
seller
and
buyer
did
not
require
an
interstate
of
shipment
of
goods.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
yes.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
that
--
that's
correct.
any
--
any
locally
consummated
sale
where
the
--
where
the
buyer
intends
whether
then
with
or
without
the
knowledge
of
the
seller,
if
he
intends
to
transport
that
--
that
goods
out
and
even
though
that
intent
is
known
of
the
seller,
even
though
it's
a
fact
of
the
case,
it's
irrelevant.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
it
can
be
taxed
because
that's
a
locally
consummated
sale.
the
interstate
commerce
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
contract.
the
seller
has
no
obligation
to
get
the
goods
across
the
state
line
to
an
out-of-state
water
works
or
sewerage
project.
there's
no
requirement.
there
wasn't
even
any
finding
of
fact
by
the
--
there
that
as
here
by
the
--
by
the
commission
at
the
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
no,
the
contracts
here
are
all
setup.
they're
tied
into
the
job.
we
paid
the
purchasers,
the
common
carrier
established
freight
rate
for
hauling
the
goods
to
the
out-of-state
job
site.
the
purchaser's
truck
driver,
when
he
drove
into
the
boundary
with
his
truck,
he
signed
the
bill
of
lading,
bill
of
lading
showed
on
its
face,
the
out-of-state
destination,
and
we
paid
that
purchaser.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
the
wood
preserving
situation,
like
the
harvester
case
was
a
fully
consummated
local
sale
where
the
only
--
there
was
no
--
no
requirement
in
the
contract
that
necessitated
an
interstate
transport
of
the
goods.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
the
bill
of
lading
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
the
bill
of
lading
in
the
wood
preserving
case
was
held
in
view
of
the
completed
delivery
and
transfer
of
title
in
indiana
to
be
irrelevant.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
the
title
--
the
technical
title
passed
to
fob
foundry
and
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
yes.
but
the
delivery
to
the
customer
--
customer's
truck
driver
was
not
a
fully
consummated
delivery.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
that's
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
yes,
that
is
it,
mr.
justice,
but
i
might
also
add
that
in
all
these
cases,
the
pipe
is
paid
for
out
of
the
proceeds
of
the
particular
governmental
job.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
that's
correct.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
absolutely.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
that's
--
that's
right
and
the,
and
the
--
and
each
--
and
each
sale
is
paid
for
out
of
the
proceeds
of
that
particular
job.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
that's
--
that
is
correct.
there
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
because
under
the
record,
all
of
the
--
in
all
these
cases,
the
pipe
is
paid
for
out
of
the
job
before
any
quotation
is
made
or
contract
entered
into
the
sales
department
of
the
respondent
gets
a
legal
description
of
the
real
property
where
that
pipe
is
going
to
be
buried,
so
that
it
can
file
a
mechanic's
lien
in
order
to
get
a
collection
or
it
gets
the
name
of
the
bonding
company
if
the
job
bonded
so
that
a
job
can
--
so
that
a
suit
could
be
filed
against
the
bonding
company.
and
as
a
matter
of
proof,
we
are
able
and
have
always
been
able,
even
where
the
contractor
goes
--
well,
to
prove
that
the
pipe
went
into
that
particular
job
and
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
the
evidence,
mr.
justice,
is
that
they're
paid
for
out
of
the
proceeds.
the
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
that's
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
that's
correct.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
that
is
the
evidence
here
that
the
pipe
is
paid
for
in
practically
all
cases
out
of
the
proceeds
of
the
particular
job
on
which
it's
used.
now,
the
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
the
contractor
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
the
contractor
owes
it
by
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
the
invoices
provide
30
days
in
that,
but
the
evidence
is
that
--
and
in
the
light
of
this
information
about
the
legal
description
of
the
real
estate
and
the
method
of
payment
that
it
comes
--
he's
paid
for
out
of
the
proceeds
of
the
particular
job
on
which
it's
used.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
the
risk
of
loss
is
technically
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
in
the
buyer.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
the
risk
of
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
the
risk
of
loss
is
in
the
buyer.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
because
he
has
title
to
the
goods
in
transit
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
and
it
has
been
--
it
has
been
delivered
to
him,
but
it
has
been
delivered
to
him
for
the
sole
and
the
paid
purpose
as
in
the
case
of
a
common
carrier
if
hauling
that
--
hauling
those
goods
to
that
particular
sewerage
or
water
works
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
no,
because
the
facts
as
found
by
the
lower
court
are
--
are
directly
contrary
to
that,
mr.
justice.
the
contract
is
not
over.
the
contract
required
the
interstate
shipment
of
goods
across
the
state
line
into
the
out
of
work
--
out-of-state
waterworks.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
yes.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
that's
correct.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
well,
we
pay
him
the
freight
and
we
had
the
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
that's
right.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
we
--
yes,
because
the
evidence
is
that
--
in
the
whole
contractual
setup
here
is
that
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
the
--
in
this
particular
business,
the
company
follows
each
length
of
pipe
by
piece
right
into
the
ground
and
follows
it
right
through
until
it
gets
paid
out
of
the
proceeds
of
that
--
of
that
ground.
and
occasionally,
some
of
these
contractors
go
broke
as
the
contractor
did
in
the
air
force
academy
and
we
have
to
go
into
court
and
prove
that
each
piece
of
pipe
was
buried
in
a
specific
piece
of
colorado
real
estate
and
collect
it.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
absolutely.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
so
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
if
it
were
a
sale
on
open
credit,
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
we
would
--
we
would
have
to
go
in
and
prove
it.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
the
--
i
don't
believe,
mr.
justice,
that
there
is
any
question
of
what
the
colorado
use
tax
is
--
is
applicable
here.
the
company
affects
the
sale
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
it
has
been
collected
and
remitted.
the
colorado
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
no,
the
company.
the
seller
--
the
seller
has
been
--
has
been
billing
them
on
the
invoice.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
that's
--
that's
correct
and
because
of
the
--
and
because
under
scripto
and
general
trading,
and
even
far
more,
so
here
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
oh,
we're
--
we're
obligated
to
--
to
--
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
well
here,
we've
got
sales
offices,
mr.
justice
in
all
these
states.
our
activity
is
not
only
the
negotiation
of
the
sale,
the
constant
work
with
the
municipal
engineering
water
department
authorities.
there
is
matter
of
the
collection
activity
out
of
the
state
where
we're
--
we're
in
those
--
we're
in
these
states.
mr.
c.
m.
gilmour
very
--
we
have
--
we're
in
--
we're
in
activity,
sales
collection,
negotiation
activity
in
all
those
states.
thank
you
very
much
for
your
kind
attention.
if
the
court
has
no
more
questions,
we'll
submit
the
matter.
