justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
--
is
that
a
matter
of
the
construction
of
your
own
statute
or
do
you
say
that
the
constitutional
requirement
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
you
don't
suggest
that
you're
forced
to
exempt
these
sales
and
make
the
common
carrier
--
whether
the
deliveries
made
to
a
common
carrier,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
in
this
--
in
this
case
that's
before
the
court,
do
you
think
there's
really
substantially
a
lot
of
difference
between
delivery
to
a
common
carrier
where
under
the
uniform
sales
act,
the
title
passes
at
the
time
you
delivered
it
to
a
common
carrier
and
the
delivery
to
a
man
own
trucks?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
risk
is
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
risk
--
who
is
the
risk
on
when
it's
delivered
to
a
common
carrier?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
there
isn't
a
contractual
arrangement,
who's
the
risk
for
losses
--
justice
byron
r.
white
when
the
risk
--
which
means
that
the
carrier
can't
pay
the
risk
of
the
buyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
on
--
and
who's
got
title
to
it
--
who's
got
the
insurable
interest
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean,
i'm
just
wondering
what
the
really
the
substantial
difference
is
between
delivery
to
the
common
carrier
and
delivery
to
the
man's
own
truck?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
say
colorado
would
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
use
tax
there
had
an
exemption
--
had
a
credit
for
any,
any
sales
tax
had
paid.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know
as
a
matter
of
practice
whether
do
it
or
whether
you
just
can't
find
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
actually
think
that
we
--
it
probably
adverted
to
international
harvester
is
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
perhaps
it
ought
to
be
raised
when
--
when
the
fellow
pays
his
use
tax
in
colorado.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
ruled
--
didn't
they
rule
on
the
constitutional
ground
that
the
reason
that
the
--
that
the
law
may
--
may
cover
it,
but
that
it
can't
because
of
the
united
states
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
--
well
then,
the
risk
of
loss
isn't
on
the
buyer
as
you
say
--
but
you're
talking
about
the
original
contract.
you
are
talking
about
the
original
contract
before
they
buyer
said,
“couldn't
i
please
pick
this
up
at
your
plant?”
because
you
originally
contemplated
sending
it
to
them
by
common
carrier,
do
you
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
came
and
said,
“let
me
pick
this
up
from
your
plant
and
you'll
get
me
credit
for
the
freight
and
it
will
cost
me
less
than
the
--
than
the
freight.”
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
you
pay
him
the
freight,
but
you
give
him
credit
for
what
the
common
carrier
freight
would
be,
not
what
it
costs
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
wants
to
come
and
pick
it
up
himself.
do
you
really
think
your
transaction
isn't
over
because
of
what
the
original
contract
says,
even
though
the
buyer
says
that,
“i
want
this
--
do
me
this
favor”?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
have
accrued
an
account
receivable
until
and
unless
that
is
arrives
in
colorado?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
not
what
i'm
getting
at,
it
hasn't
got
the
--
the
only
reason
you
do
it
is
because
you
have
accrued
an
account
receivable,
and
you
want
to
collect
your
money
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
you
want
to
collect
your
money
because
they
owe
it
to
you,
so
you
file
a
mechanic's
lien.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
whether
the
colorado
authorities
are
aware
of
the
--
this
situation
of
whether
it
is
the
buyer
that
talked
to
the
colorado
use
tax
collectors
about
this
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
going
to
collect
it
though.
i
mean
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
been
collected
because
the
buyer
has
been
returning
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
--
well,
that's
why
--
on
the
company
because
of
the
colorado
use
tax
collector.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
put
the
freights
on
that
and
leave
it
up
to
the
buyer
and
let
the
buyer
freight
it
out
from
colorado
use
tax
though.
