justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
which
you
mean,
the
sale
is
in
fact
been
consummated
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
utah?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
i
take
it
that
utah
law
was
that
on
delivery
to
a
common
carrier,
the
sale
is
com
--
within
utah,
the
sale
was
consummated
within
utah,
you
wouldn't
recognize
any
constitutional
discovery,
would
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
that
fact
as
one
of
the
federal
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
suppose
that's
blown
up,
anyway?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
eyes
are
not
that
good
for
these.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
cause
mr.
gilmour,
the
end
--
the
destination
--
partly,
a
completed
transaction
was
that
the
pipe
gets
to
its
destination
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
a
sense
that
it's
all
wrapped
up
into
the
fitting
arrangement
that
you
described
to
us
awhile
ago,
is
that
the
distinction
you're
drawing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
example,
suppose
they're
building
a
sewer
system
or
something
out
in
colorado,
and
that
also
takes
all
different
kinds
of
specification
of
the
pipe
and
the
rest
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
described
the
truck
--
you
in
effect
say
that
there's
no
transaction
completed
notwithstanding
the
technical
type
of
the
pipe
until
it's
--
this
pipe
special
specification
arrives
at
the
job
site
in
colorado.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
that
sense,
interstate
is
in
effect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
the
colorado
governmental
agency
or
maybe
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
--
doesn't
your
client
couldn't
pay
the
interest,
mr.
gilmour,
unless
the
pipe
gets
to
the
job?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
there'd
be
no
proceed
unless
the
pipe
gets
in
place
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
the
job?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
to
say
then
that
unless
the
pipe
actually
gets
into
place,
at
this
job
site
in
colorado,
you
wouldn't
get
paid
for
it?
