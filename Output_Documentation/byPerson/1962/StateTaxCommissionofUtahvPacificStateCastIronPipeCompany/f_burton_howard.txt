mr.
f.
burton
howard
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
imposition
of
sales
tax
by
the
petitioner,
the
state
tax
commission
of
utah
upon
sales
of
cast-iron
pipe,
fittings
and
other
related
commodities
by
the
pacific
states
cast
iron
pipe
company,
who
is
the
respondent
here,
to
contractors
who
came
within
the
state
of
utah,
took
title
to
and
accept
the
delivery
of
the
items
so
purchased
within
that
state,
and
thereafter
pursuant
to
the
contractual
agreement
with
the
seller,
transport
of
the
items
outside
of
the
state
of
utah
for
use
and
consumption.
this
is
an
interstate
commerce
situation
which
has
arisen
to
trouble
less
court
in
times
passed.
utah
law
requires
that
every
sale
consummated
within
the
borders
of
that
state
be
subjected
to
a
sales
tax
and
the
question
here
presented
for
review
is
whether
or
not
this
tax
as
imposed
by
the
tax
commission
on
sales
conducted
by
the
respondent
in
this
manner
is
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
which
is
prohibited
by
the
commerce
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
case
began
as
an
original
proceeding
in
the
supreme
court
of
utah
to
review
an
order
and
decision
of
the
tax
commission
imposing
sales
tax
liability
upon
to
respondent
for
these
sales.
the
pipe
company
below
contended
that
as
its
quotations
which
it
issued
to
prospective
purchasers,
call
for
a
sale
fob,
its
foundry
provo,
utah
and
as
it
claimed
to
be
legally
obligated
to
effectuate
delivery
across
state
lines
out
of
utah
and
that
out-of-state
use
and
consumption
being
conceded
by
the
tax
commission,
and
because
of
these
facts,
there
was
sufficient
certainty
of
out-of-state
use
or
destination
to
require
the
decision
of
these
sales
were
in
interstate
commerce.
respondent
further
contended
below
that
the
risk
of
multiple
taxations
herein
constituted
the
sales
tax
imposed
by
the
tax
commission,
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
now
after
argument,
the
utah
supreme
court
ruled
that
the
states
sales
tax
statute
as
applied
under
the
facts
of
this
case
reflected
a
situation
offensive
to
the
commerce
clause,
apparently
because
of
the
certainty
of
foreign
destination
and
with
considerable
reliance
upon
the
richfield
oil
case.
the
tax
commission
filed
a
timely
petition
for
certiorari
which
is
granted
by
this
court
on
october
8,
last
fall.
the
facts
as
found
on
the
record
indicate
that
the
pipe
company
respondent
is
a
nevada
corporation
qualified
to
do
business
in
utah,
that
it
manufactures
cast-iron
pipe,
fittings
and
related
items,
selling
in
most
of
the
western
states,
and
that
the
majority
of
its
sales
are
in
interstate
commerce,
that
is
the
delivery
is
made
to
the
purchaser
across
state
lines.
these
sales
are
not
involved
in
the
present
controversy
at
all.
the
materials
purchased
from
the
pipe
company
by
contractors
coming
into
utah,
wherein
they
took
delivery
of
the
materials
in
utah,
the
title
passed
in
utah
subject
to
quotations
given
them
by
the
pipe
company
and
invitations
given
them
by
the
pipe
company
to
haul
their
our
own
materials
on
their
own
trucks
are
the
only
matters
which
are
involved
and
need
efficiency
assessment
which
has
been
levied
by
the
state.
these
materials,
the
materials
which
were
taken
in
utah
by
the
ultimate
consumers
whereof
specified
sizes
and
lengths
to
conform
to
the
specifications
of
out-of-state
jobs.
often
these
specifications
were
federal
specifications.
they
were
concededly
designed
to
be
used
out
of
utah
and
this
is
one
of
the
items
that
the
respondent
relies
upon
in
great
detail.
all
of
the
sales
however,
were
proved
at
the
home
office
of
the
respondent
in
provo,
utah.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
no,
your
honor.
the
original
quotations
which
where
issued
by
the
respondent
to
all
bidders
on
these
federal
projects
or
other
projects,
the
original
quotations
contemplated
that
delivery
would
be
made
out
of
utah
to
the
job
site,
where
the
work
was
going
to
be
done,
but
in
these
quotations,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
provide
that
the
prices
quoted
under
fob
are
foundry
at
ironton
with
whole
present
3,500
or
whatever
it
may
have
been
found
a
minimum
rate
of
truckload
freight
allowed
to
the
foreign
destination,
that
the
parties
here
on
all
of
the
sales
which
we've
included
in
this
deficiency
assessment,
the
parties
by
a
subsequent
correspondents
are
dealing
have
modified
this
original
requirement.
and
they
have
agreed
that
delivery
is
to
be
made
to
the
purchaser
at
the
pipe
company's
foundry
in
utah.
exhibit
6b
is
typical
of
this,
it's
found
in
the
record
on
197,
and
this
exhibit
and
other
similar
ones
which
we've
included
provides
the
prices
quoted
herein
are
fob,
our
foundry
at
littleton,
provo,
utah
with
full
truckload
freight
allowed
to
farmington,
new
mexico.
therefore,
these
are
delivered
prices
and
then
significantly,
should
you
desire
to
haul
this
material
from
our
foundry
at
provo,
utah,
we
will
allow
$20.40
per
net
ton
which
is
the
current
freight
rate.
all
of
these
sales,
where
the
contractor
came
into
utah
pursuant
to
this
or
similar
invitations
to
haul
the
pipe
in
its
own
trucks
and
to
take
delivery
in
utah
have
been
included
in
this
deficiency
assessment,
others
have
not.
now
--
mr.
f.
burton
howard
that's
right.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
that's
right.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
that
is
correct.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
utah
at
least
requires
a
consummated
transaction
of
sale,
unless
there's
delivery
to
the
ultimate
consumer
within
the
borders
of
the
state
of
utah,
if
the
delivery
is
processed
across
states
line,
there
is
no
consummated
sale
within
our
state.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
the
sales
tax
law
in
utah
is
contained
in
several
sections
but
one
of
them
says
that
the
tax
applies
to
every
consummated
transaction
of
sale.
this
is
constructed
and
a
matter
of
statute
that
we
don't
apply
to
--
mr.
f.
burton
howard
we
feel
that
that
isn't
before
the
court.
utah
supreme
court
seemed
to
take
the
position
that
we
conceded
this
--
mr.
f.
burton
howard
the
case
has
generally
upheld
that
delivery
to
a
common
carrier
is
not
delivery
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
he's
not
acting
as
an
agent
for
the
consumer
--
mr.
f.
burton
howard
--
for
purposes
of
--
mr.
f.
burton
howard
this
is
often
a
matter
a
contractual
agreement.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
usually
the
risk
is
on
the
carrier.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
that's
correct.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
you're
talking
about
the
situation
where
a
common
carrier
carries
the
property?
mr.
f.
burton
howard
well
--
mr.
f.
burton
howard
i
can't
personally
see
any
substantial
difference
as
far
as
the
--
the
theory
that
we're
proceeding
in
this
case
on.
in
other
words,
we're
holding
that
this
is
a
local
transaction
which
is
taxable
by
the
state
and
i
can't
--
mr.
f.
burton
howard
yes.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
no.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
that
the
construction
of
the
--
of
the
utah
law
and
the
regulations
of
the
commission
at
the
present
time
have
precluded
taxation
of
this
kind
of
situation.
now,
when
the
contractor
comes
into
utah,
he
--
and
accepts
delivery
of
the
property,
he
receives
two
documents.
he
signs
a
bill
of
lading
and
an
invoice
to
accompany
these
goods
in
their
transportation
out
of
utah.
the
bill
of
lading
and
the
invoice
together,
we
submit,
showed
the
title
passes
to
the
purchaser
in
utah
at
the
moment
of
delivery.
in
this
regard
exhibit
4d
is
typical
and
it's
found
on
the
record
in
155.
it
provides
in
section
1
(a),
the
carrier
or
party
in
possession
of
any
of
the
property
herein
described
shall
be
liable
as
at
common
law
for
any
loss
thereof
or
damage
thereto,
except
as
hereinafter
provided.
section
7
on
the
same
exhibit
provides
the
owner
or
a
consignee
shall
pay
the
freight
and
an
average
of
any
--
mr.
f.
burton
howard
no.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
it
isn't.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
the
invoices
which
accompany
these
goods
--
this
is
in
larger
print,
exhibit
4e
on
page
158,
is
typical
of
these
invoices
and
if
you
will
notice
paragraph
four
provides,
delivery
is
to
be
made
fob
to
seller's
foundry
upon
which
the
seller's
responsibility
ceases.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
paragraph
four,
on
page
158,
delivery
is
to
be
made
fob
to
seller's
foundry
upon
which
the
seller's
responsibility
ceases.
paragraph
five
says,
freight
charges
when
agreed
in
a
selling
price
are
to
be
paid
by
the
buyer.
now,
as
a
result
of
all
of
these
contractual
documents,
a
result
of
both
parties
considered
the
pipe
to
be
the
exclusive
property
of
the
vendee
at
the
time
it
accept
the
delivery
at
the
respondent's
foundry.
in
this
regard,
mr.
w.
w.
clyde,
a
utah-based
in
domicile
contract
purchaser
who
was
a
successful
bidder
on
the
glen
canyon
arizona
project,
upon
being
asked
if
he'd
obtained
a
permit
to
operate
as
a
contract
motor
carrier
of
property
as
required
by
the
utah
statute
testified
you
don't
need
a
license
to
carry
your
own
products.
this,
if
nothing
else,
indicates
the
intention
of
the
parties
to
consider
this
the
property
of
the
contract
purchaser
as
it
accepted
delivery
in
utah.
now,
based
upon
these
facts,
in
this
testimony,
the
tax
commission
concluded
the
title
of
the
pipe
passed
to
the
purchaser
in
utah,
that
the
purchaser
who
are
not
shipping
for
hire,
were
not
contract
motor
carriers
of
property
and
could
not
be,
and
that
the
pipe
company
have
no
obligation
to
deliver
the
pipe
out
of
utah
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
this
particular
set
of
findings
was
not
reviewed
by
the
utah
supreme
court.
petitioner's
position
essentially
is
that
we
have
a
completed
transaction
of
sale
within
the
state
of
utah
and
that
the
international
harvester
--
the
department
of
treasury
case
control
here,
just
as
in
that
case,
if
you
will
recall,
indiana
imposed
a
gross
receipt
tax
on
indiana
sellers
who
sold
indiana
goods
to
out-of-state
buyers
who
came
into
that
state,
accept
the
delivery
and
immediately
transported
the
materials
out
of
the
state
of
indiana.
the
agreement
to
sell
and
the
delivery
took
place
there
and
this
court
held
that
a
local
transaction
was
made
a
taxable
event
and
that
it
--
that
event
was
separate
and
distinct
from
the
transportation
or
intercourse
which
was
interstate
commerce.
the
court
here
held
we
only
hold
that
where
a
state
seeks
to
tax
gross
receipts
from
interstate
transactions
consummated
within
its
borders,
its
power
to
do
so
cannot
be
withheld
on
constitutional
grounds
where
it
treats
wholly
local
transaction
by
the
same
way.
so
in
the
present
case,
we
have
the
goods
manufactured
and
produced
in
utah,
a
title
passing
in
utah,
and
delivery
to
the
ultimate
consumer
in
utah,
and
we
feel
that
this
case
is
controlling.
however,
respondent
disagrees.
the
pipe
company
contends
that
because
of
the
nature
of
the
quotations
and
the
bills
of
lading
that
this
case
differs
from
the
international
harvester
case
and
that
there
is
more
than
a
mere
intention
to
deliver
outside
of
the
state
here,
but
that
rather
there
is
a
contractual
obligation
to
deliver
outside
of
the
state
present
in
this
case.
the
tax
commission
concedes
that
the
materials
were
purchased
for
out-of-state
use
and
consumption.
we
don't
concede
that
the
pipe
company
was
legally
obligated
to
effectuate
this
delivery
out
of
utah
but
even
assuming
for
purposes
of
argument
that
it
was,
the
case
then
falls
within
the
holding
of
the
department
of
treasury
v.
wood
preserving
corporation
case.
i'd
like
to
review
the
facts
of
that
case
just
a
moment.
this
case
was
decided
in
the
same
year
as
the
international
harvester
case.
it
was
a
case
where
indiana
imposed
a
tax
upon
the
gross
income
that
wood
preserving
corporation
which
basically
consisted
of
gross
receipts
from
the
sale
of
raw
ties
to
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad,
under
two
contracts.
the
first
contract
there
called
for
the
sale
of
raw
ties
to
the
railroad
fob,
the
cars
on
the
railroad
tracks
in
indiana.
a
supplemental
contract
called
for
the
delivery
of
all
ties
outside
of
indiana.
in
ohio,
it
required
them
to
be
shipped
to
ohio
for
treatment.
the
payments
to
the
respondent
in
that
case,
the
wood
preserving
corporation
were
made
in
pennsylvania
and
deposited
in
the
bank
account
there
to
its
account.
the
lower
court
in
that
case
held
that
these
receipts
were
not
taxable
in
indiana
and
this
court
held
in
reviewing
and
distinguishing
the
adams
manufacturing
case
which
is
relied
on
by
the
respondent,
held
that
this
was
an
intrastate
local
sale.
this
court
said
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
what
indiana
had
authority
to
lay
the
tax
and
further
held
that
313
u.s.
68,
they
were
local
transactions,
sales
and
deliveries
of
particular
ties
by
the
respondent
to
the
railroad
company
in
indiana,
the
transactions
were
nonetheless
intrastate
activities
because
the
ties
less
sold
and
delivery
were
forthwith
loaded
on
the
railroad
cars
to
go
to
ohio.
and
in
commenting
on
the
supplemental
contract
which
required
delivery
out
of
the
state
of
indiana
to
another
state
for
treatment,
this
court
said
that
this
was
not
a
consequence
in
light
of
the
facts
showing
a
completed
delivery
in
indiana.
we
submit
that
basically,
this
case
is
bottomed
on
those
two
cases.
now,
there's
a
significant
feature
--
mr.
f.
burton
howard
one
of
them
was
and
one
of
them
wasn't,
i
understand.
the
wood
preserving
case
requisitions
for
the
ties
were
issued
in
ohio
but
accepted
at
the
home
office
in
indiana,
very
similar
to
the
problem
we
have
here.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
that
is
basically
correct.
the
respondent
here
had
sales
offices
out
of
the
state
of
utah,
in
various
states,
principally
in
denver.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
yes.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
no,
the
acceptance
was
always
in
utah.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
perhaps
mr.
gilmore
can
clarify
this
more
than
i
can.
but
basically,
the
pipe
company
maintained
sales
offices
in
various
parts
of
the
western
united
sates
and
the
original
quotations
are
issued
from
those
offices
to
contractors
known
to
be
bidding
on
the
big
federal
projects
involved.
these
quotations
always
provide
on
the
bottom
that
they're
subject
to
acceptance
in
the
home
office
in
provo.
i
cite
this
on
my
brief
and
i'm
not
--
oh,
here
it
is
on
page
149,
the
last
line
of
the
quotation.
there
are
no
agreements
or
verbal
understandings
outside
of
its
proposal
foregoing
shall
become
a
contract
to
agreement
only
when
accepted
by
you
as
purchaser
and
approved
in
writing
by
an
executive
officer
of
our
company
in
our
home
office
in
provo,
utah.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
i
don't
believe,
in
practice,
it
is,
although
the
exhibit
i
just
said
was
signed
by
the
pipe
company.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
i
don't
know
about
the
procedure
involving
that
as
a
whole.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
no.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
i
think
concededly
that
the
--
that
the
pipe
company
was
obligated
at
that
time
to
deliver
these
goods
to
the
foreign
job
site.
but
subsequently
there
was
another
arrangement
made
whereby
they
agreed
that
the
delivery
should
be
made
in
utah
instead.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
i
think
your
understanding
is
correct
on
that.
the
significant
point
of
this
case
has
escaped
treatment
so
far
in
the
international
harvester
case,
19
years
ago
much
was
said
concerning
double
taxation
of
the
class
d
sales
there
involved.
it
was
argued
by
the
appellant
that
it
would
also
probably
be
subjected
to
a
tax,
the
illinois
retailers'
occupation
tax
on
some
of
the
sales
which
had
been
included
in
the
indiana
gross
receipts
tax.
and
this
court
at
that
time
speaking
through
mr.
justice
douglas
said
there
will
be
time
to
cross
that
bridge
when
we
come
to
it.
and
i
think
we've
come
to
this
bridge
today.
respondent
in
point
one
of
its
brief
alleges
that
the
tax
here
sought
to
be
a
levied
by
utah
as
the
state
of
the
seller
is
on
proceeds
of
interstate
sales
of
the
bulk
of
which
have
already
been
taxed
by
the
states
of
the
buyer.
this
allegation
is
somewhat
misleading.only
the
state
of
colorado
has
imposed
or
will
impose
a
use
tax
upon
the
goods
sold
by
the
respondent,
which
were
ultimately
consumed
in
that
state.
these
transactions
constitute
32.3%
of
the
total
sales
involved
in
this
deficiency.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
yes,
your
honor,
they
will.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
i
wish
i
had
been
able
to
find
that
exemption
because
i
haven't.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
i
don't
know
as
a
matter
of
practice
and
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
it.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
i
think
so.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
the
respondent
is
registered
with
the
state
of
colorado
to
correct
--
to
collect
use
tax.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
understand
that
it
did
collect
tax
on
these
transactions.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
been
forwarded
to
colorado
or
not,
the
record
doesn't
show
that.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
that's
correct.
before
i
go
into
that,
i'd
like
to
comment
on
the
rest
of
the
deficiency,
that
final
destinations
of
some
these
sales
were
arizona,
new
mexico
and
wyoming.
this
is
36.6%
of
the
total
sales
here
and
we
can
find
no
indication
in
the
record
that
these
sales
have
been
taxed
or
will
be
taxed,
and
that
no
tax
has
been
paid.
mr.
--
two
of
the
states,
mr.
justice
white
have
this
reciprocal
exemption
you're
talking
about
which
provide
that
if
the
purchaser
can
prove
that
he
has
paid
the
sales
tax
on
the
items
in
the
state
of
origin,
they
won't
impose
a
use
tax
on
the
use
or
other
enjoinment
in
the
state
of
destination.
those
two
states
are
new
mexico
and
arizona.
we
can't
find
in
the
record
any
indication
that
these
taxes
have
been
paid
to
any
of
these
states.
mr.
clyde,
the
grand
canyon
contractor
again
testified
that
he
had
included
arizona
taxes
in
preparing
his
bids
to
the
government,
but
the
record
is
silent
as
to
whether
they
have
been
paid.
the
other
31.1%
of
the
sales
went
into
the
states
of
montana
and
idaho,
which
at
that
time
and
today,
to
the
best
of
my
understanding
have
no
sales
or
use
tax
by
at
all.
so
whatever
this
court
decides
concerning
a
double
taxation
of
the
colorado
sales,
the
majority
of
these
sales
have
not
been
taxed
and
will
not
be
subject
to
double
taxation
and
we
submit
all
within
the
language
of
mr.
justice
douglas
again
in
the
international
harvester
case
where
he
said
--
for
example
in
the
wood
preserving,
case
the
state
to
which
the
purchaser
took
the
ties
might
also
have
sought
to
tax
the
transactions
by
levying
a
use
tax
but
we
did
not
withhold
the
hand
of
indiana's
tax
collector
on
that
account.
basically,
the
risk
or
the
likelihood
or
the
possibility
of
double
taxation
not
being
present
was
not
enough
to
strike
down
the
tax
imposed
in
the
international
harvester
case
when
this
matter
was
considered
there.
this
double
tax
situation
was
foreseen
like
i
have
said
19
years
ago
in
the
international
harvester
case,
it
was
also
anticipated
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
freeman
v.
hewitt
and
i
cite
his
reference
as
to
this
matter
in
my
brief.
i
think
we've
come
to
the
crux
of
the
case
really
here.
the
petitioner
cannot
deny
that
there
is
a
double
taxation
of
these
transactions
if
utah
imposes
the
sales
tax
on
the
sales
and
colorado
imposes
the
use
tax
on
their
user
consumption.
however,
we
believe
that
this
procedure
is
implicitly
authorized
by
this
court,
where
in
mcleod
v.
dilworth,
this
court
distinguished
between
a
sales
and
a
use
tax.
the
court
said
a
sales
tax
and
a
use
tax
be
in
many
instances
bring
about
the
same
result
but
they
are
different
in
conception,
are
assessments
upon
different
transactions,
and
the
interlacing
of
the
two
legislation
authorities
within
our
federation
may
have
to
justify
themselves
on
different
constitutional
grounds.
a
sales
tax
is
a
tax
on
a
freedom
of
purchase
and
a
use
tax
is
a
tax
from
the
enjoyment
of
that
which
was
purchased.
we
think
it
is
also
significant
that
the
purchaser
here
deliberately
chose
to
submit
itself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
utah.
it
could
have
protected
itself
on
these
so-called
interstate
transactions
by
making
them
real,
legitimate,
bona
fide
interstate
transactions
and
accepting
delivery
across
the
state
line,
but
it
didn't
want
to
do
that.
we
submit
that
possibly
the
petitioner
or
the
purchaser
itself
burdens
interstate
commerce
more
than
the
state
by
deliberately
placing
itself
in
a
situation
where
it
will
possibly
be
subjected
to
two
or
even
more
state
taxes
which
arise
out
of
the
same
transaction
of
sale.
we
don't
feel,
however,
that
the
state
of
utah
or
the
state
of
colorado
is
unduly
burdening
interstate
commerce
when
it
imposes
its
tax
on
a
legitimate
local
and
that
which
occurs
in
either
state.
but
the
significant
point
here
is
that
the
buyer
brought
this
all
on
himself.
there
are
certain
equities
involved
which
we
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention.
if
the
goods
are
to
be
turned
over
to
a
buyer,
tax
exempt
on
his
naked
representation
that
they
are
to
be
taken
to
another
state
or
based
upon
some
contractual
agreement
which
may
be
broken
that
they
are
to
be
taken
to
another
state,
the
fact
of
subsequent
exportation
is
very
difficult
to
establish.
thousands
of
transactions
would
fall
into
this
category
across
this
nation.
and
petitioner
submits
that
it
is
impracticable
for
--
from
an
administrative
point
of
view
to
require
the
taxing
authorities
to
the
various
states
to
verify
the
out-of-state
destination
of
claimed
local
sale.
another
basic
consideration
is
the
principle
of
tax
administration
that
all
taxpayers
who
are
required
to
bear
a
burden
should
bear
it.
nothing
was
more
damaging
or
detrimental
to
taxpayer
morale
and
to
have
a
situation
developed
where
a
one
man
knows
that
his
neighbor
is
the
evading
a
tax
that
he
has
to
pay.
this
situation
may
well
develop
here
and
well
it
occurs
all
too
frequently
now,
we
feel
that
it
would
be
seriously
aggravated
by
adopting
the
petitioner's
viewpoint.
for
these
reasons,
we
urge
that
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
utah
be
reversed
and
that
the
tax
commission's
assessment
be
upheld
as
a
lawful
levy
on
a
series
of
wholly
local
transactions.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
the
classical
distinction,
your
honor,
is
the
point
of
asset
you've
titled.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
i
think
that
will
be
one
point
in
utah
with
a
full
freight
allowed
to
a
point
outside
of
utah
is
really
a
meaningless
conglomeration.
fob
traditionally
hasn't
met
the
point
where
title
passes.
this
pipe
company
is
trying
to
have
its
cake
in
either
two
in
this
--
in
this
situation
we
think.
there
is
a
great
difference.
mr.
f.
burton
howard
it
is
but
the
--
the
significant
considerations
here
are
that
fob,
means
passage
of
title
and
the
responsibility
for
bearing
the
freight
is
also
an
indicia
who
actually
owns
the
goods
at
the
time.
and
we
submit
that
the
purchaser
takes
delivery
and
title
and
owns
the
goods
and
has
the
responsibility
of
thereafter
assuming
the
freight
all
in
the
state
of
utah
that
this
is
a
local
transaction
and
has
to
be
taxed
under
utah
law,
we
can
exempt
them.
