mr.
george
a.
kain
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
the
petitioner
in
his
opening
argument
related
to
the
facts,
surrendering
original
detention
of
the
petitioner,
raymond
haynes.
i
would
like
to
cover
some
of
the
facts
that
occurred
after
this
original
surrendering
detention.
after
mr.
haynes
had
been
taken
into
the
police
car
and
transported
to
police
headquarters
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
he
was
arrested
at
9:25.
he
reached
the
police
headquarters
at
about
10
p.m.
that's
indicated
at
the
record
--
in
the
record
on
page
55.
he
was
there
questioned
by
lieutenant
wakeley
for
a
period
of
one-half
hour
and
one-half
hour
only.
that
also
appears
at
page
55
of
the
record.
at
that
time,
he
confessed
in
detail
to
the
robbery
of
this
service
station
in
conjunction
with
the
help
of
his
brother.
when
lieutenant
wakeley
testified,
he
was
not
asked
the
question:
did
raymond
haynes
asked
you
if
he
could
call
a
lawyer
or
asked
you
to
call
a
lawyer
for
him.
lieutenant
wakeley
was
never
asked
this
question.the
questions
in
this
regard
were
asked
at
page
56
of
the
record.
after
the
petitioner
orally
confessed
to
lieutenant
wakeley,
the
lieutenant
testified
that
he
may
have
asked
to
call
his
wife,
and
the
lieutenant
told
to
petitioner
haynes
that
his
wife
would
be
called.
the
petitioner
in
his
testimony
did
not
testify
that
he
had
ever
asked
lieutenant
wakeley
to
call
a
lawyer.
the
lieutenant
testified
at
the
trial
and
he
stated
in
detail
what
mr.
raymond
haynes
had
told
him
with
respect
to
his
oral
confession.
no
objection
of
any
kind
was
offered
by
the
defense
to
the
lieutenant's
narration
of
this
oral
confession.
the
lieutenant
finished
with
the
petitioner,
raymond
haynes.
in
other
words,
he
finished
talking
to
him
at
10:30
p.m.
on
the
evening
of
his
arrest.
that's
found
in
the
record
at
page
55.
the
petitioner
was
placed
in
a
lineup
for
about
15
or
20
minutes
according
to
his
own
account.
that
appears
at
page
98
of
the
record.
he
was
then
taken
to
the
city
jail,
not
the
county
jail.
the
city
jail
is
in
the
same
building
with
the
detective
headquarters.
this
appears
in
the
record
at
page
98.
the
petitioner
himself
indicates
that
he
was
taken
to
the
city
jail.
the
petitioner
himself
testified
that
nothing
else
was
done
that
night.
that's
found
at
page
98
of
the
record.
this
puts
aside
any
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
any
nighttime
questioning.
mr.
george
a.
kain
page
98
of
the
record.
the
petitioner
testified
that
nothing
else
was
done
that
night.
the
time
as
near
as
we
can
determine
from
the
record
that
he
was
placed
in
the
city
jail
was
about
11
p.m.
to
12
midnight.
there's
no
real
way
of
telling
what
time
it
was.
there's
no
indication
of
any
deprivation
of
adequate
food
or
adequate
sleep.
now,
the
petitioner
testified
that
detective
pike
who
worked
at
4
p.m.
to
midnight
shift
on
this
evening,
made
promises
to
him,
and
that
he
asked
detective
pike
for
an
attorney.
the
record
shows,
however,
that
detective
pike
never
talked
to
the
petitioner
that
he
was
in
the
same
room
with
him;
that
he
dealt
with
the
petitioner's
brother
keith
haynes
but
that
he
had
no
dealings
with
raymond
haynes
other
than
to
place
him
in
the
lineup.
mr.
george
a.
kain
the
detective,
your
honor?
mr.
george
a.
kain
detective
pike
testified
that
he
had
never
talk
with
the
petitioner.
that's
found
at
page
51
of
the
record.
this
is
in
complete
contradiction
to
raymond
haynes'
testimony
that
pike
had
promised
him
communication
if
he
would
confess
and
that
pike
had
told
him
that
--
or
that
--
excuse
me,
that
he
had
asked
detective
pike
if
he
could
call
an
attorney.
mr.
george
a.
kain
your
honor,
under
the
practice
that
existed
in
spokane
of
1857,
there
was
a
police
department
rule
that
held
if
a
man
is
detained
on
investigation
only,
that
he
is
not
permitted
phone
calls.
there
is
a
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
only
two
people
testified
in
this
regard,
your
honor,
one
was
the
lieutenant
who
testified
that
no
phone
calls
were
permissible.
lieutenant
cockburn
testified
that
he
did
not
know
whether
a
man
would
be
permitted
to
call
an
attorney.
mr.
george
a.
kain
yes,
nothing
was
said,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
delivering
of
messages
or
anything
of
that
nature.
and
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
lieutenant
told
the
petitioner
that
he
would
inform
his
wife
that
he
was
being
held.
i
can
contend
that
this
is
a
means
of
communication,
both
of
these.
mr.
george
a.
kain
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
the
next
morning,
the
morning
after
the
petitioner's
arrest
at
9
a.m.,
the
petitioner
was
fingerprinted.
at
9:30
a.m.,
detectives
cockburn
and
--
not
detective
pike
but
detectives
cockburn
and
peck
first
talked
to
the
petitioner.
they
interrogated
him
for
one
and
one-half
to
two
hours
according
to
their
version
indicating
they
started
at
9:30.
this
is
found
in
the
record
at
page
67.
actually,
they
interrogated
petitioner
haynes
for
one
and
one-half
hours
because
a
stenographer
testified
that
she
completed
the
dictation
of
the
written
confession,
exhibit
6,
at
11
a.m.,
one
and
one-half
hours
after
the
two
detectives
first
spoke
with
petitioner
haynes.
during
this
one
and
one-half
hour
period,
the
petitioner
haynes
made
an
oral
confession
to
detectives
peck
and
cockburn.
the
oral
confession
was
a
detailed
one.
detective
cockburn
testified
in
detail
at
the
trial
as
to
the
contents
of
this
oral
confession
and
there
was
no
objection
of
any
kind
to
his
testimony.
according
to
the
petitioner's
version,
he
was
questioned
one
hour
or
longer
by
these
two
detectives;
that's
found
at
page
99
of
the
record.
the
petitioner
in
this
written
confession
made
no
request
to
call
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
the
petitioner
testified
that
he
asked
these
two
detectives
for
permission
to
call
his
wife,
not
an
attorney,
but
his
intention
was
to
call
his
wife.
he
testified
that
they
promised
him
this
telephone
call
if
he
would
confess.
i
contend
that
the
record
is
conflicting
because
of
his
own
later
statements
and
because
of
statements
of
detective
cockburn
who
testified.
mr.
george
a.
kain
because
of
the
petitioner's
own
later
statements,
your
honor,
and
because
of
the
testimony
of
the
detective
cockburn
who
testified.
mr.
george
a.
kain
i
might
first
state,
your
honor,
that
the
petitioner
in
his
confession
made
no
request
for
an
attorney,
nor
did
he
request
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
in
the
written
confession,
your
honor,
made
no
request.
he
did
request
to
call
the
prose
--
to
see
the
prosecuting
attorney.
he
made
no
other
request
to
that
of
any
nature.
as
i
indicated,
he
attributed
promises
and
denials
of
communication
to
detectives
peck
and
cockburn.
however,
when
he
was
asked
a
few
moments
later,
the
determination
of
this
written
confession,
he
was
asked
this
question:
“did
we
--”
meaning
detectives
peck
and
cockburn,
“--
make
any
promises
or
threats
to
you?”
and
he
replied,
“no.”
now,
this
was
in
direct
and
absolute
conflict
with
his
testimony
at
the
trial.
he
was
then
asked
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
yes,
your
honor,
i'm
coming
to
that
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
--
just
a
moment.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
detectives
peck
and
cockburn
said
to
him,
“did
we
make
any
threats
or
promises?”
the
petitioner
replied,
“no.”
the
detectives
then
asked,
“has
any
police
officer
made
you
any
threats
or
promises?”
and
the
petitioner,
in
response
to
that
question,
even
though
he
did
in
his
testimony,
he
attributed
promises
to
various
officers,
in
response
to
that
question,
he
said
only
one
thing,
“no,
except
the
lieutenant
promised
me
that
when
i
was
booked
and
not
when
i
confessed,
that
the
lieutenant
promised
me
when
i
was
booked,
i
could
call
my
wife.”
now
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
no,
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
they
never
testified
to
that.
there's
--
there
can
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
they
testified,
your
honor,
that
in
this
only
that
he
could
not
call
until
he
had
been
booked.
the
officers
never
admitted
and
it
is
our
contention
that
it
does
not
occur
that
he
was
ever
told
that
he
could
call
his
wife
only
when
he
had
confessed
or
cooperated.
that
was
contended
but
that
is
not
our
position
and
no
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
the
officer
who
testified
detective
cockburn
was
asked,
i
believe,
first
of
all,
whether
or
not,
the
petitioner
haynes
had
asked
to
call
his
wife
and
i
believe
detective
cockburn
indicated
that
he
could
recall
no
request
of
this
nature.
he
did
not
category
--
categorically
and
unconditionally
deny
this.
he
was
asked
whether
or
not,
he
promised
the
petitioner
haynes
the
right
to
call
if
he
confessed
or
cooperated,
i
believe.
he
did
not
categorically
deny
this
but
he
did
say,
“i
don't
recall”,
or
“i
don't
remember”,
or
“i
don't
recall
any
such
request.”
now,
that
doesn't
mean,
your
honor,
that
a
request
was
made.
it
means
that
in
this
officer's
recollection,
he
recalled
no
such
request
by
the
petitioner.
and
my
contention
is
this:
the
petitioner
himself
said
there
were
no
promises
in
his
written
confession
which
he
signed.
then
two
or
three
hours
after
he
dictated
this
confession,
he
was
asked
to
read
this
confession
over
and
make
corrections
if
there
were
any
mistakes.
he
read
this
confession.
he
did
make
corrections,
but
he
did
not
make
any
corrections
with
respect
to
whether
he
had
been
made
any
promises,
indicating
at
that
time
that
the
only
promise
he
had
been
made
since
his
arrest
was
the
promise
that
he
could
call
his
wife
when
he
had
been
booked.
and
i
submit
that
this
promise
call
for
nothing
from
this
petitioner.
it
depended
upon
his
being
booked,
in
other
words,
that
arbitrary
point
which
the
officers
wrote
his
name
in
another
section
of
the
log
in
the
jail
charging
him
with
a
specific
crime.
mr.
george
a.
kain
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
kain
your
honor,
possibly
a
--
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
make
myself
clear.
the
officer
was
asked
whether
he
had
told
the
petitioner
that
he
could
call
his
wife
when
he
had
confessed.
and
the
officer
said
he
could
not
remember,
i
believe.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
your
honor,
my
contention
is
this.
that
is
correct.
two
officers
told
him
that.
mr.
george
a.
kain
your
honor,
to
me
when
he
was
told
that
he
could
not
call
until
he
was
booked,
that
meant
that
he
could
not
call
until
the
police
decided
to
place
his
name
in
another
portion
of
the
log
in
the
jail,
not
that
he
could
not
call
until
he
confess.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
testimony
in
the
record
other
than
from
the
petitioner
himself
that
says
--
that
he
was
told
that
you
can
call
your
wife
only
when
you
confess
or
cooperate.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
in
the
state
of
washington,
we
don't
have
what
apparently
is
called
the
mallory
rule.
a
man
must
be
taken
before
the
justice
of
the
peace
or
a
committing
magistrate
within
a
reasonable
time.
this
man
was
arrested
after
the
court
had
closed
on
a
thursday.
he
was
given
an
appearance
before
a
committing
magistrate
the
following
afternoon;
the
day,
the
first
day
of
court
session
in
the
afternoon.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
he
--
the
petitioner
himself
although
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
may
have
taken
this
view
that
when
they
were
through
questioning
him,
he
would
be
booked.
but
that
does
not
mean
i
submit
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
that
was
the
practice,
i
believe,
in
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
--
in
--
in
1957,
that
they
could
hold
him
for
a
reasonable
time.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well
no,
your
honor,
the
police
had
a
duty
to
produce
the
defendant
before
a
justice
of
the
peace
or
a
committing
magistrate
within
a
reasonable
time.
they
couldn't
hold
him
forever,
and
this
man
was
given
an
appearance
the
following
day.
now,
as
i
said,
i
can't
tell
what
the
petitioner
had
in
his
mind.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
i
--
your
honor,
i
can't
assume
how
long
they
would
hold
this
man.
he
had
already
confessed
twice.
he
confessed
the
first
time
before
he
made
any
request.
now,
how
could
he
possibly
be
contended
that
they
would
hold
him
until
he
confess,
be
--
he
had
already
confessed
before
he
did
any
request.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
apparently
the
next
morning
they
were,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
kain
there
is
a
substantial
distinction,
yes.
mr.
george
a.
kain
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
kain
i
believe
so,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
kain
yes,
the
requests
with
the
instructions
are
also
in
the
record.
mr.
george
a.
kain
the
trial
court's
instructions
on
16
and
17,
those
are
the
trial
court's
instructions
that
deal
with
the
voluntariness
and
with
the
statute
in
question.
mr.
george
a.
kain
yes,
your
honor.
i
might
make
this
statement
in
that
regard,
your
honor,
the
--
excuse
me,
i'll
pass
that
for
the
moment.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
your
honor
in
the
state
of
washington
at
that
time,
the
jury
was
the
ultimate
decider
as
to
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
just
as
they
decide
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
george
a.
kain
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
kain
i
believe
at
that
time,
your
honor,
they
were
permitted
to
consider
the
statement
and
the
effect
that
the
inducements
--
excuse
me,
may
have
had
with
respect
to
voluntariness,
and
i
believe
the
next
paragraph
of
that
instruction
holds
that
if
the
jury
found
that
the
inducements
were
sufficient
to
overcome
voluntariness,
then
they
were
not
to
consider
that
confession.
mr.
george
a.
kain
no,
your
honor,
i
believe
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
yes.
as
i
read
the
--
it
would
be
the
fourth
paragraph
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
as
i
read
the
fourth
paragraph
your
honor,
they
were
permitted.
the
jury
were
permitted
to
consider
the
statement
and
the
inducements.
however,
setting
aside
the
question
of
corroboration,
the
jury
was
to
decide
whether
or
not
these
inducements
were
sufficient
to
overcome
the
will
of
the
accused.
mr.
george
a.
kain
in
case
of
a
threat,
your
honor,
i
believe
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
fear
and
produced
by
threats
i
believe,
made
the
confession
involuntary.
mr.
george
a.
kain
in
inducements
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
did
not,
unless
the
jury
felt
in
their
opinion
that
the
inducement
was
sufficient
to
overcome
the
will
of
the
accused.
mr.
george
a.
kain
oh
yes,
what
i
--
what
i
meant
to
say,
your
honor
was
that
they
were
to
consider
inducements
if
they
existed
and
consider
whether
or
not
the
inducements
were
sufficient
to
overcome
the
will
of
the
accused.
the
question,
the
prime
question
before
the
jury
was,
is
this
confession
voluntary?
the
trial
court
under
the
washington
practice
at
that
time
had
only
this
authority
if
the
state
conceded
that
the
confession
was
involuntary
or
the
admitted
facts
show
that
the
confessional
was
involuntary.
the
trial
court
could
withhold
it
from
the
jury.other
than
that,
the
jury
decided
the
question
of
voluntariness
just
as
they
decided
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
the
petitioner
when
he
testified
with
regard
to
the
post-confession
procedure
made
this
conclusion
in
answer
to
a
question
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
call
his
--
to
call
his
wife.
he
indicated
that
he
had
no
purpose
to
call
an
attorney
and
merely
said
to
call
his
wife.
there
was
no
testimony
of
any
request
that
he
actually
made
to
anyone
to
call
other
than
the
request
to
the
lieutenant
and
the
conflicting
request
made
to
the
conflicting
evidence
as
to
request
made
to
other
police
officers.
there
were
no
jailers
produced
at
the
trial
to
indicate
that
they
had
received
request
and
refused
them.
the
petitioner's
wife
testified.
she
indicated
that
--
she
went
to
the
city
jail
the
day
following
the
petitioner's
arrest
and
she
asked
merely
this
question,
or
she
called
the
city
jail
by
telephone.
she
asked
this
question.
“is
raymond
haynes
in
jail?”
and
she
was
told,
“yes,
he
is.”
she
then
asked
why
and
she
identified
herself
and
said
that
she
was
mrs.
haynes.
the
police
at
that
point
refused
to
give
her
further
information.
of
course,
this
was
a
telephone
call.
they
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
this
was
mrs.
haynes
or
merely
a
curious
neighbor.
and
they
said
if
you
want
to
know
why
he's
in
jail,
read
it
in
the
papers.
she
did
not
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
pardon?
yes.
mr.
george
a.
kain
she
did
not
ask
to
see
mr.
raymond
haynes.
she
did
not
ask
to
call
him
by
telephone.
she
made
no
request
at
that
time
other
than
why
he
is
in
jail
--
why
he
was
in
jail.
and
this
is
found
at
page
131
of
the
record.
now,
the
following
day,
she
again
went
to
the
city
jail
and
she
asked
about
raymond
haynes'
automobile.
she
talked
to
detective
cockburn.
she
did
not
ask
to
visit
him
at
that
time.
now,
bear
in
mind
that
this
is
after
the
confession,
after
the
booking
so
that
the
rule
did
not
prevent
her
seeing
the
petitioner.
she
could
have
seen
him
had
she
sought
too,
because
there
was
no
so-called
small
book
rule
once
he
had
been
booked.
she
went
to
the
jail
personally
after
he
had
been
booked
but
she
did
not
ask
to
see
him,
she
did
not
ask
to
telephone
him,
she
did
not
ask
that
a
message
be
delivered
to
him.
she
only
asked
about
the
family
car.
mr.
george
a.
kain
i
believe
i'll
have
to
concede
that,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
george
a.
kain
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
your
honor
in
that
regard,
the
petitioner's
wife
and
the
petitioner
both
indicated
that
they
had
no
communication
for
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
no
jailer
to
say
that
that
was
not
the
fact,
no.
the
petitioner
testified
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
call.
the
state
produced
no
law
enforcement
people
to
show
that
that
statement
was
false.
mr.
george
a.
kain
being
post-confession
procedure
for
what
it's
worth
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
--
as
you
say.
although
as
i
indicated,
the
rule
did
not
prevent
communication
once
the
man
had
been
booked,
the
rule,
it
was
enforced
at
that
time.
and
the
petitioner's
wife
testified
that
she
first
saw
the
petitioner
one
week
after
his
surrender.
that's
on
131.
she
didn't
testify
that
she'd
ever
tried
to
see
him
before
that.
she
merely
said
she
first
saw
him
at
that
time.
and
the
rule
would
not
have
prevented
her
seeing
him,
nor
would
the
rule
have
prevented
the
petitioner's
calling
out.
the
rule
applied
to
those
held
by
the
police
charged
with
merely
investigation
for
a
crime
and
not
booked
for
a
specific
crime.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
your
honor
i'll
have
to
admit
this
case
without
the
confessions
was
rather
unusual.
there
were
two
eye
witnesses.
one
of
those
has
since
died.
these
eye
witnesses
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
yes.
yes,
he
did.
and
he
identified
the
accused
and
his
brother
as
being
those
two
persons
who
had
committed
a
robbery
upon
himself
at
his
service
station.
of
course,
these
three
oral
confessions,
the
confession
to
the
uniformed
officers,
the
confession
to
lieutenant
wakeley,
and
the
confession
to
detectives
cockburn
and
peck
were
also
in
evidence.
mr.
george
a.
kain
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
kain
no,
there
were
--
there
were
two
witnesses
that
gave
--
each
gave
--
giving
a
partial
identification
that
one
of
those
two
witnesses
has
since
died,
yes.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well
i'm
--
i
believe
that
the
service
station
owner
testified
and
his
wife
testified,
gave
a
partial
description
of
the
accused
as
i
recall.
her
testimony
isn't
in
the
record
but
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
kain
yes.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
your
honor,
each
party
of
course
had
the
duty
to
designate
those
portions
of
the
record
to
be
prepared
for
this
court
and
in
view
with
the
cause
involved,
i
felt
that
i
--
if
i
set
forth
a
portion
of
the
testimony
of
the
actual
victim,
the
owner
of
the
service
station,
that
would
indicate
that
there
was
at
least
one
eye
witness.
i
then
went
to
the
portion
of
the
record
which
covered
the
wife
and
i
could
find
no
small
number
of
pages
that
encompass
this
identification
that
i
could
pick
out
and
put
in
the
record
so
i
left
at
it
indicating
that
the
owner
himself
had
identified
the
accused.
mr.
george
a.
kain
no.
mr.
george
a.
kain
no,
your
honor,
i
couldn't
find
anything
within
a
period
--
a
space
of
--
a
page
or
two,
and
i
didn't
wish
to
expand
the
record
forever.
i
thought
it
would
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
it's
--
it's
in
the
trial
court
record,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
kain
but
you're
aware
of
how
trials
proceed,
questions
are
asked
and
some
answers
aren't
responsive
then
they
refer
to
it
again
and
i
thought
it
would
be
sufficient
to
indicate
in
as
much
as
the
truthfulness
of
a
confession
or
other
evidence
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
yes.
mr.
george
a.
kain
i
felt
it
because
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
i
think
the
state
had
a
pretty
good
case
without
the
confession,
yes.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
i
meant
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
the
record
indicates
the
identification
of
the
husband,
the
owner
of
the
service
station.
and
my
recollection
is
that
his
wife
was
not
as
sure
in
her
identification
as
he
was.
that's
all
i
can
say,
your
honor.
if
the
court
please,
under
a
consideration
of
all
of
these
circumstances,
it
made
the
following
observations
to
be
compared
possibly
with
other
cases
although
that
is
not
critical
or
decisive.
the
petitioner
here
was
an
adult.
he
was
a
person
of
average
intelligence
according
to
his
testimony
at
the
trial.
he
was
a
skilled
workman.
he
was
a
sheet
metal
worker.
he'd
been
convicted
of
five
serious
crimes
including
robbery,
theft
of
a
car,
breaking
and
entering,
jailbreak,
resisting
arrest.
he
was
on
parole
at
the
time
he
came
to
the
state
of
washington
and
he
was
pretty
familiar
with
the
law
enforcement
procedures.
in
other
words,
he
--
as
our
--
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
held
he
was
not
a
lamb.
he
was
told
only
that
he
could
call
his
wife
when
he
was
booked
on
a
specific
charge.
he
was
never
told
according
to
the
undisputed
evidence
that
he
could
call
his
wife
only
when
he
confessed.
he
made
two
oral
confessions
after
his
surrender
and
initial
confession.
he
was
detained
for
about
14
hours
without
being
permitted
communication
prior
to
signing
--
excuse
me,
14
hours
prior
to
the
dictating
the
written
confession.
and
he
was
detained
16
hours
prior
to
his
signing
this
written
confession.
he
was
giving
--
given
a
hearing
as
i
indicated
before
a
committing
magistrate
within
17
to
19
hours
after
his
arrest
and
the
day
following
his
arrest
when
the
courts
were
not
in
session
on
the
day
of
his
arrest.
and
this
is
kind
of
unusual.
it's
contrary
to
the
majority
of
the
confession
cases,
at
no
time
did
this
petitioner
denied
his
guilt
to
the
police.
from
the
very
moment
of
his
arrest,
he
did
not
deny
his
guilt;
he
confessed.
he
was
interrogated
for
a
total
time
of
one
hour
and
15
minutes
according
to
one
account,
the
maximum
time
that
he
could
have
been
interrogated
by
all
persons
concerned
was
two
hours
and
20
minutes.
during
this
time,
during
this
two
hours
and
20
minutes
maximum,
he
made
four
separate
confessions;
three
of
them
oral
and
one
of
them
written.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well
your
honor,
confessed,
when
i
use
that
term,
i
didn't
mean
a
confession
in
detail.
he
said
he
was
the
one
they
were
after.
he
got
in
the
car
and
said
he'd
robbed
the
service
station.
he
then
pointed
out
the
service
station
he
had
robbed.
in
other
words,
to
my
way
of
thinking,
that's
a
complete
admission
of
his
guilt
unless
a
confession
brief
as
it
may
be.
mr.
george
a.
kain
at
that
time,
your
honor,
he
was
actually
had
not
been
booked
on
any
charge.
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
police
station.
mr.
george
a.
kain
the
second
statement
commenced
at
10
p.m.
and
finished
at
10:20
or
10:30
and
he
made
no
request
of
any
kind
during
that
time.
mr.
george
a.
kain
i
don't
believe
he'd
been
booked
at
that
time,
your
honor.
i
think
he
was
placed
on
the
so-called
small
book
after
he'd
been
placed
in
the
lineup.
they're
placed
on
this
book
when
they‘re
--
all
it
is,
is
a
jail
log.
and
their
names
are
placed
in
this
jail
log
when
they're
taken
to
the
jail.
in
this
case
that
didn't
occur
until
maybe
11
or
12
o'
clock.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
that's
true.
of
course,
the
uncontradicted
test
of
testimony
is
that
the
petitioner
didn't
ask
to
make
any
telephone
call
to
anybody
until
he'd
confess
twice
orally.
mr.
george
a.
kain
no,
it
was
before
the
lineup
and
after
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
after
he
had
confessed
to
lieutenant
wakeley
at
about
10:20
or
10:30
p.m..
mr.
george
a.
kain
the
lieutenant
could
not
recall
for
certain
whether
he
asked
to
call
his
wife
but
he
must
have
because
the
lieutenant
then
admitted
in
his
testimony
that
he
had
told
the
petitioner
that
he,
the
lieutenant,
would
call
his
wife.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well
it
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
your
honor,
i
can't
explain
why
the
police
held
this
man
after
they
had
--
had
two
oral
confessions.
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
drew
from
me,
it's
obvious
that
the
police
desire
a
written
confession.
mr.
george
a.
kain
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
your
honor
the
--
the
small
book,
other
than
the
infamous
name
it's
acquired
recently,
the
small
book
is
just
a
log,
as
i
indicated,
in
the
jail,
and
the
booking
procedure
required
that
a
man
who
is
booked
on
a
specific
charge
would
be
put
in
what
i
would
imagine
they
must
have
called
the
large
book.
and
if
no
specific
charge
had
been
brought
against
the
man,
in
other
words,
if
he
had
until
that
point
at
which
a
warrant
and
a
complaint
had
been
filed,
he
could
be
held
only
on
the
small
book.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
your
honor,
i
must
admit
that
the
practice
in
spokane,
washington
at
that
time
until
this
day
is
this.
that
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
no,
no,
not
this
small
book
rule,
your
honor.
people
now
are
permitted
to
use
the
telephone,
permitted
communication
with
friends
and
attorneys.
this
small
book
rule
didn't
last
for
any
period
of
time.
but
the
practice,
they
does
continue
in
the
city
of
spokane
is
this.
that
when
a
man
is
arrested
even
though
the
question
of
his
guilt
is
obvious,
he
is
not
taken
before
a
committing
magistrate
until
legal
process
had
be
filed
in
the
court,
because
the
purpose
of
the
judge
is
twofold.
first,
to
advice
the
man
as
to
his
constitutional
rights,
secondly,
to
set
bond,
he
cannot
set
bond
until
he's
been
fully
apprised
to
the
facts
surrounding
the
offense
and
he
sets
bond
by
looking
at
the
allegations
and
the
warrant
questioning
the
officer
and
then
deciding
what
the
bond
shall
be.
so
the
practice
is
that
within
a
reasonable
time
after
an
arrest,
the
complaint
warrant
are
tied
up,
presented
to
the
judge
for
signing,
and
at
that
point,
that
the
man
is
given
a
hearing.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
your
honor,
i
can
say
this.
if
the
--
if
this
had
occurred
during
the
ordinary
business
hours,
he
would
have
been
taken
immediately
to
the
prosecutor's
office
on
the
basis
of
what
he
had
said,
a
complaint
and
warrant
would
have
been
typed
up
because
it
was
obvious
that
this
man
had
--
a
crime
had
occurred
and
this
man
had
committed
it.
this
would
have
been
presented
to
the
judge
and
then
he
would
have
been
given
an
appearance
at
that
time,
because
the
judge
would
have
had
something
to
deal
with.
mr.
george
a.
kain
that's
correct.
mr.
george
a.
kain
that's
correct.
mr.
george
a.
kain
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
kain
no,
i'm
sorry,
i
may
have
misunderstood.
i
didn't
--
it's
true
in
this
case
they
could
have
--
they
could
have
been
present
at
the
hour
of
8:30
the
next
morning
to
request
a
formal
complaint
and
warrant
on
the
facts
that
they
had
at
that
time.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
this
is
kind
of
an
oddity.
his
brother
in
sharp
contrast
to
this
petitioner
had
no
criminal
record.
his
brother
steadfastly
refused
to
confess.
he
may
have
confessed
but
of
the
inception
at
the
very
beginning
with
contrast
to
mr.
haynes,
raymond
haynes,
he
said
nothing
to
the
police.
mr.
george
a.
kain
he
said
nothing
to
the
police.
i'm
not
certain.
i
believe
a
written
confession
was
introduced
in
evidence
with
respect
to
the
petitioner
keith
haynes.
the
time,
i
believe,
he
was
questioned
for
about
the
same
period
of
time
that
raymond
was.
mr.
george
a.
kain
i
believe
it
was
sometime
before
noon,
as

your

mr.

mr.

the

convicted
and
received
probation,
yes.
if
i
could
complete
this
summary,
your
honor,
the
--
there
were
no
false
inducements
to
confess
in
this
case.
there
was
no
indication
of
lack
of
adequate
food
and
rest.
there
was
no
nighttime
questioning
unless
we
consider
nighttime
from
11:00
to
midnight.
there
was
no
physical
violence.
he
was
questioned
by
only
four
officers,
i
submit,
in
contrast
to
the
petitioner's
briefs.
he
was
confe
--
questioned
by
officer
--
five
officers.
officer
usher,
the
uniformed
officer,
lieutenant
wakeley,
detectives
peck,
cockburn,
and
detective
pike.
in
this
case,
no
person,
relative,
friend,
or
attorney
actually
sought
to
visit
with
petitioners
and
was
turned
away.
the
testimony
undisputed
is
that
if
an
attorney
went
to
the
jail
to
see
him,
he
would
have
been
admitted.
the
petitioner's
wife
knew
of
his
incarceration
at
least
the
next
day,
the
next
morning
and
could
have
seen
fit
to
her
an
attorney
who
would
have
been
admitted
in
the
jail
even
under
the
rule
excluding
friends.
mr.
george
a.
kain
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
whether
he
notified
her
or
not,
your
honor,
but
the
fact
that
she
appeared
at
the
police
station
the
following
day
and
said,
“is
keith
in
jail?”
(inaudible)
err,
excuse
me,
“is
my
husband
raymond
in
jail?”
you
can
take
that
either
way
that
she'd
been
told
and
was
verifying
it
or
that
she
had
not
been
told
and
was
there
asking
for
him
because
possibly
he
hadn't
come
home.
mr.
george
a.
kain
that
must
have
been
before
--
after
the
dictation
of
the
written
confession
and
before
the
signing
of
the
written
confession.
mr.
george
a.
kain
yes,
he
could
your
honor,
if
the
lawyer
had
known
he
was
in
jail.
mr.
george
a.
kain
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
coupled
with
the
testimony
of
lieutenant
cockburn
to
the
effect
that
a
lawyer
could
see
an
accused.
mr.
george
a.
kain
that
a
lawyer
could
see
an
accused
even
though
he
was
on
the
small
book
if
he
knew
he
was
in
jail.
i
feel
that
the
answer
of
lieutenant
wakeley
if
somewhere
he
wants
to
contact
--
if
some
relative
wants
to
contact
a
lawyer,
that's
their
privilege.
there
wouldn't
be
much
sense
in
making
that
statement.i
contend
if
the
lawyer
couldn't
do
his
job
once
he'd
been
contacted.
and
lieutenant
cock
--
or
detective
cockburn
testified
that
a
lawyer
could,
under
that
rule,
visit
with
an
accused
booked
on
the
so-called
small
book
or
held
for
investigation
only.
mr.
george
a.
kain
the
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
i
believe
it's
on
69,
your
honor.
mr.
george
a.
kain
at
that
--
on
that
page
it
says
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
i
--
i've
compared
the
facts
in
this
case
even
though
at
first
blush
they
seem
extremely
vicious
with
two
cases
that
were
decided
by
this
court
solely
on
the
basis
of
age
and
i'd
like
briefly
to
refer
to
the
facts
in
those
two
cases.
i
know
that
each
case
determines
--
rest
upon
its
own
facts
but
i
feel
that
there
is
such
a
divergence
in
the
facts
between
these
cases
that
they're
worthy
of
mention.
the
first
is
haley
versus
ohio,
332
u.s.
596.
in
that
case,
the
petitioner
was
15
years
old
contrasted
to
mr.
haynes'
age
of
25
to
30.
he
was
questioned
for
five
hours
and
this
questioning
didn't
start
until
midnight.
the
five
or
six
policemen
questioned
him
in
relays.
he
denied
implication
in
the
crime
until
he
was
shown
alleged
confessions
of
coconspirators.
on
the
other
hand,
petitioner
haynes
admitted
from
the
very
inception
that
he
was
the
guilty
party.
the
petition
--
mr.
haley,
the
young
man,
was
told
that
his
confession
was
voluntary
and
he
was
told
that
no
promises
have
been
made.
he
was
not
asked
this
question
as
was
petitioner,
mr.
haynes.
a
lawyer
in
the
haley
case
actually
tried
to
see
this
young
boy
twice
and
was
turned
away.
we
don't
have
that
situation
in
the
haynes'
case.
his
mother
wasn't
permitted
to
see
him
for
five
days.
he
had
no
court
appearance
for
three
days
after
the
confession
was
signed.
and
there
was
some
evidence
of
physical
abuse
in
that
case
without
citing
the
law
that
this
court
set
forth
had
held
that
this
case
depended
basically
upon
the
tender
years
of
the
petitioner.
and
this
court
held
that
what
transpired
would
make
--
make
this
pass
for
careful
inquiry
if
a
mature
man
were
involved.
it
then
went
on
the
hold
because
this
was
a
mere
child.
the
record
should
be
very
carefully
scrutinized.
referring
to
the
nighttime
interrogation
from
midnight
to
5
a.m.
by
relays
by
police
officers,
the
court
held
in
part,
we
cannot
believe
that
a
lad
of
tender
years
is
a
match
for
the
police
in
such
a
contest.
in
gallegos
versus
colorado,
a
recent
case
cited
by
this
court,
the
petitioner
was
only
14
years
of
age.
his
formal
confession
was
signed
five
days
after
his
arrest.
he'd
been
held
incommunicado
all
of
this
time.
his
mother
actually
sought
to
see
him.
she
actually
went
to
see
him
and
was
refused.
this
court,
citing
the
haley
case,
held
that
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
only
14
years
of
age,
puts
this
case
on
the
same
footing
as
haley
versus
ohio.
they
held
in
part,
we
deal
with
the
person
who
is
not
equal
to
the
police
in
knowledge
and
understanding.
in
that
language,
in
those
two
cases,
i
feel
is
the
--
the
crux
of
the
situation
here
because
i
submit
that
the
petitioner,
raymond
haynes,
was
very
equal
to
the
police
in
knowledge
and
understanding.
in
the
gallegos
--
the
case
of
gallegos
versus
colorado,
this
court
held
that
the
young
man,
14
years
of
age,
cannot
be
compared
with
an
adult
in
full
position
of
his
senses
and
knowledgeable
of
the
consequences
of
his
admissions.
and
therefore,
even
though
mr.
gallegos
confessed
immediately
upon
his
arrest,
they
held
it
because
he
didn't
know
what
his
constitutional
rights
were,
that
this
immediate
confession
shouldn't
be
considered.
but
in
this
case,
mr.
haynes,
i
submit,
had
the
adequate
edu
--
as
adequate
an
education
as
mr.crooker
did
in
the
case
of
crooker
versus
california.
mr.
crooker
had
a
college
education
and
some
law
school
training.
i
asked
you
to
consider
the
conduct
of
a
law
--
a
freshman
in
law
school
when
detained
by
the
police
and
then
consider
a
man
in
the
position
of
mr.
haynes
when
detained.
a
man
who
had
been
convicted
of,
i
believe,
six
crimes,
five
of
them
serious
crimes,
three
of
them
appeared
to
be
felonies,
one
of
them
was
armed
robbery,
the
facts
indicated
in
this
case,
he
had
committed
another
armed
robbery.
he'd
been
on
parole,
i
think,
the
record
said
for
some
two
years
is
that
--
is
as
indicated
in
the
decision
of
the
washington
state
supreme
court
with
no
disrespect,
they
held
this
man
was
not
a
lamb.
i
feel
that
under
the
facts,
he
was
as
adequately
equipped
to
deal
with
the
police
as
mr.
crooker
was
in
the
case
of
crooker
versus
california.
mr.
george
a.
kain
your
honor,
i
read
the
record
again
last
night
and
i'm
not
prepared
to
answer
that.
mr.
george
a.
kain
well,
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
in
the
printed
record
indicating
that
any
exceptions
were
taken
by
the
defense.
whether
there
were
exceptions
taken
in
the
trial
court,
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
one
way
or
the
other.
i
don't
recall.
mr.
george
a.
kain
i'm
not
able
to
say
that,
your
honor.
i
didn't
try
that
case.
sometimes
they
are
transcribed
if
it's
an
important
case
where
a
counsel
requests
that
they'd
be
transcribed
in
cases
which
are
a
matter
of
course.
i
can't
say
in
this
case.
continuing,
your
honor,
i
--
i
submit
that
the
liberal
consideration
given
to
the
petitioners
in
haley
and
in
gallegos
versus
colorado
not
be
given
to
this
petitioner
because
the
facts,
they
were
not
on
the
same
footing.
the
facts
here
are
basically
boiled
down
to
this.
what
--
i
suppose
some
people
would
call
a
hardened
criminal
was
told
that
you
can't
call
your
wife,
not
an
attorney,
but
you
can't
call
your
wife
until
you've
been
booked.
i
was
only
held
17
to
19
hours
before
an
appearance
and
he
signed
a
written
confession
after
16
hours.
now,
the
question
is,
was
this
--
mr.
george
a.
kain
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
he
did
say,
i
didn't
--
that
he
did
testify
that
he
had
asked
some
police
officers
for
a
lawyer.
mr.
george
a.
kain
that
--
my
contention
is,
your
honor,
that
their
facts
were
actually
disputed.
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
didn't
really
differ
on
the
law
to
any
great
extent,
they
differed
on
the
facts.
half
of
them
or
five
of
them
took
one
version
and
four
of
them
took
the
other
version.
the
judge
who
wrote
this
portion
of
the
dissent
took
a
version
which,
in
effect,
favored
the
petitioner,
haynes.
my
contention
is
that
the
facts
were
in
dispute
on
every
material
issue
except
those,
of
course
that
have
been
conceded
before
this
court,
that
the
trial
court
and
the
jury
decided
those
facts
against
haynes,
and
of
course,
he
was
an
impeached
witness.
they
apparently
didn't
believe
what
he
had
to
say
and
they
decided
those
facts
against
him.
mr.
george
a.
kain
i
concede
that
when
the
written
confession
was
dictated,
he
did
ask
--
i
don't
say
that
he
begged
but
i
say
that
he
asked
to
see
the
prosecutor,
for
what
reason
i
cannot
say.
the
petitioners
have
assumed
the
reason,
i'm
not
--
i
can't
say
why
he
made
that
request.
to
touch
briefly
upon
what
has
been
charged
in
the
petitioner's
supplemental
brief
as
an
unlawful
arrest
in
the
consequent,
illegal
seizure
of
oral
declarations
from
the
accused,
i
briefly
state
that
our
position
is
this.
that
first
of
all,
this
attack
was
raised
for
the
first
time
not
in
the
trial
court,
not
in
the
state
supreme
court,
not
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
not
in
the
petitioner's
brief
on
the
merits,
but
for
the
first
time
by
the
petitioner's
supplemental
brief
filed
before
this
court.
there
were
no
objections
or
motions
made
before
the
trial
court
on
this
matter.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
was
not
permitted
to
consider
it,
whether
or
not
the
arrest
was
unlawful,
whether
the
admissions
were
illegally
seized
under
the
authority
cited
in
the
respondent's
reply
brief.
i
submit
that
that
matter
is
not
here
for
consideration
at
this
time.
assuming
that
an
objection
was
made,
it
was
not
properly
preserved
according
to
the
state
practice
which
requires
assignments
of
error
in
the
briefs
and
actual
argument
in
the
brief
on
the
point
alleged
to
be
error
under
authority
of
beck
versus
washington,
369
u.s.
541.
i
submit
that
an
illegal
arrest
and
search
and
seizure
of
oral
declarations
is
not
an
enlargement
of
an
argument
made
in
the
state
court
system
that
was
discussed
in
the
case
of
wilson
versus
crooker.
now
assuming,
just
for
the
purpose
of
argument,
that
the
error
had
been
preserved
the
facts
conclusively
show
that
the
arrest
was
lawful.
there
was
a
description
of
the
guilty
party.
a
policeman
testified
that
the
petitioner
was
stopped
but
he
didn't
quite
fit
the
description.
the
petitioner
himself
says
that
when
they
stopped
him,
they
asked
him
about
another
man,
“did
you
see
somebody
go
by?”
or
words
to
that
effect.
he
was
released.
at
that
point
he
was
released.
he
walked
up
the
sidewalk
of
a
house.
the
policeman
waited,
he
returned,
got
back
in
the
car.
the
policeman
was
still
seated
in
the
patrol
car
apparently
for
time
he
walked
up.
he
surrendered.
he
said,
“you've
got
me,
let's
go.”
when
he
talked
to
lieutenant
wakeley,
lieutenant
wakeley
testified
that
he
said,
he
might
as
well
give
up.
so
he
told
them
he
was
the
man
they
were
looking
for.
that's
what
petitioner
haynes
told
lieutenant
wakeley
about
the
surrender.
and
in
his
written
confession,
he
said,
“i
gave
up
the
ghost.”
the
meaning
of
that
is
pretty
obvious.
“i
gave
up
the
ghost”,
and
told
him,
“i
might
as
well
ride
downtown
with
him.”
the
petitioner
seeks
to
apply
the
doctrine
of
wong
sun
versus
the
united
states
to
this
situation.
i
feel
that
the
facts
are
a
great
deal
different
in
wong
sun
where
doors
were
broken
down
on
partial
information
regarding
assumed
possession
of
contraband
or
narcotics.
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
to
assume
that
the
arrest
was
illegal.
i
submit
that
the
arrest
was
not
illegal
but
the
petitioner
surrendered.
when
he
surrendered
and
at
that
moment,
he
was
arrested
not
before
because
he
was
merely
questioned.
he
says,
the
petitioner
himself
says
he
was
questioned
as
to
whether
somebody
else
might
have
gone
by
or
run
by
or
been
in
the
area.
so
when
he
was
questioned
at
that
moment
or
when
he
admitted
at
that
moment
that
he
gave
up,
he
then
was
taken
into
custody.
thank
you.
