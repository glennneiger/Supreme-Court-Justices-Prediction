justice
john

[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
at
this
point?
are
the
instructions
that
were
given
to
the
jury
on
pages
16
and
17
of
the
record,
are
those
as
given
by
the
trial
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean
these
are
not
request
to
an
--
to
instructions.
these
are
actual
instructions.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'm
interested
in
the
instructions
themselves
and
i
want
to
make
sure
that
what
was
--
what
i'm
reading
on
page
16
and
17
were
the
instructions.
justice
john
m.
harlan
including
the
question
of
the
relevancy
of
the
absence
of
counsel.
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
kain,
i
wanted
to
check
something.
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
no
exceptions
to
the
judges'
charge
were
made
on
behalf
of
the
defendant?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
reason
i
asked
that
is
because
on
132,
the
only
exception
i
see
is
made
on
behalf
of
the
state
and
i
wonder
if
that
is
something.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
other
thing
i
wanted
to
ask
you,
are
the
summations
of
counsel
to
the
jury
--
the
arguments
of
counsel
to
the
jury
included
--
they're
not
included
in
the
printed
record
but
are
they
--
were
they
transcribed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
then,
the
instruction
didn't
stop
there.
the
court
went
on
to
say,
“if
you
find
from
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
any
officer
having
custody
of
either
defendant
in
this
case
denied
him
communication
with
his
friends
or
an
attorney
in
violation
of
the
above
statute,
then
i
instruct
that
you
may
consider
such
denial
in
connection
with
the
voluntariness
of
any
statement
made.”
now,
that
instruction
certainly
conforms
to
the
law
up
to
date
in
this
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
asking
us
to
substitute
at
least
in
some
facets
a
courtesy
test
on
voluntariness
rather
than
the
test
that
up
to
now
has
prevailed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
to
put
it
in
another
way
what
you'd
like
to
see
is
the
prophylactic
rule
that
is
applied
in
the
federal
courts
under
our
supervisory
powers
as
represented
in
one
facet
by
the
mallory
rule,
you'd
like
to
see
something
of
that
kind
extend
to
the
states.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
just
heard
what
its
(inaudible)
position,
and
i
understand
that.
