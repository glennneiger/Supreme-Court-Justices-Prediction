mr.
lawrence
speiser
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
issue
as
to
whether
the
petitioner
has
been
deprived
of
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
the
introduction,
into
his
trial
on
a
charge
of
robbery,
of
a
confession
which
was
obtained
from
him
under
circumstances,
including
being
booked
for
investigation,
being
held
incommunicado,
being
refused
permission
to
call
his
wife
or
an
attorney
under
a
regular
practice
and
procedure
of
the
spokane
police
department
in
violation
of
a
state
law
in
which
a
confession
was
signed
by
him
some
16
hours
after
his
arrest
and
in
which
he
was
not
informed
of
his
constitutional
rights
until
he
was
brought
before
a
magistrate
some
18
and
a
half
hours
after
arrest.
there
is
a
second
issue
in
the
case
which
has
been
raised
in
the
filing
of
a
supplemental
brief
as
to
whether
the
confessions
obtained
from
him
after
an
arrest
without
probable
cause
should
be
excluded
on
the
basis
of
the
decisions
of
mapp
versus
ohio,
holding
the
exclusionary
rule
applicable
to
the
states
and
wong
sun
versus
united
states,
holding
that
verbal
evidence
which
has
been
obtained
after
an
arrest
without
probable
cause
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
exclusionary
principle.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
these.
on
december
19,
1957,
a
robbery
occurred
in
the
city
of
spokane,
two
men
were
involved.
the
police
were
called.
within
10
minutes,
one
of
the
men
was
captured.
fifteen
minutes
later,
a
prowl
car,
some
five
blocks
from
the
scene
of
the
robbery
which
had
received
what
was
described
as
an
incomplete
description
of
the
remaining
robber,
spotted
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
as
the
prowl
car
approached,
he
started
up
the
yard
of
a
house.
the
police
shown
a
spotlight
on
him,
he
is
called
back
to
the
car,
they
question
him
for
a
few
moments.
apparently
satisfied
with
his
explanation
and
the
discussion,
he
was
permitted
to
leave.
he
walked
back
up
the
yard
of
the
house
to
the
door.
he
fumbled
with
a
key
at
the
storm
door.
in
the
meanwhile,
the
police
sat
in
the
prowl
car,
did
not
move,
and
watched
him.
he
then
walked
back
toward
the
police
car
and
it's
a
little
unclear
from
the
record
exactly
what
transpired
first.
however,
the
office
--
the
arresting
officer
testified
that
he
walked
back
to
the
car,
he's
placed
under
arrest,
and
apparently,
at
the
same
time
or
near
the
same
time
he
said,
“you
got
me,
let's
go.”
after
being
placed
in
the
police
car,
the
officer
testified,
this
officer
usher,
that
he
admitted
the
robbery
that
he
was
crying,
that
he
was
taken
to
the
scene
of
the
robbery,
that
he
identified
it
and
then
in
response
to
a
call
from
headquarters
he
was
taken
back
to
headquarters.
at
headquarters,
he
was
booked
for
investigation.
he
was
searched.
he
had
not
been
frisked
or
handcuffed
during
the
ride
back
to
the
police
station.
on
him
was
found
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
no,
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
on
that--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
on
that
question.
it
maybe
inferred
i
believe
though
that
it
is
not
the
petitioner's
house
because
in
the
record,
he
gives
his
address
and
his
address
apparently
is
not
the
same
as
this
house.
there
was
no
attention
called
to
that
point
on
the
record.
that
--
he
arrived
back
at
the
police
station
approximately
10
p.m.,
which
was
about
a
half
hour
after
being
arrested,
he
was
interrogated
in
an
interrogation
room
by
lieutenant
wakeley
of
the
spokane
police
department.
during
the
interrogation,
the
petitioner
testified
that
he
asked
several
times
for
permission
to
call
his
wife
and
to
call
an
attorney.
lieutenant
wakeley
testified
that
he
could
not
remember
whether
he
did
or
not,
he
might
have.
apparently,
there
was
no
warning
of
constitutional
rights,
the
right
to
remain
silent
nor
the
right
to
contact
counsel.
lieutenant
wakeley
testified
that
being
held
on
what
was
called
small
book
or
held
for
investigation
meant
that
he
was
held
incommunicado.
he
could
not
call
out
nor
could
he
receive
incoming
calls
nor
visitors.
the
only
discussion
as
to
whether
an
attorney
could
get
in
to
see
him
was
that
if
an
attorney
had
been
contacted
to
by
the
family
that
would
be
another
matter.
it's
not
indicated
that
an
attorney
could
get
in.
however,
it
was
fairly
clear
from
the
testimony
of
both
lieutenant
wakeley
and
other
police
officers
that
the
practices
to
hold
him
incommunicado
without
his
having
permission
to
call
out
nor
anyone
having
permission
to
come
in
to
see
him
or
to
contact
him.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
he
--
he
testified
that
he
asked
for
permission
to
call
his
wife
or
an
attorney
during
the
evening
he
was
being
interrogated
by
lieutenant
wakeley.
lieutenant
wakeley
stated
that
he
could
not
remember
whether
he
did.
he
might
have.
apparently,
there
was
more
emphasis
in
his
request
for
permission
to
call
out
to
call
his
wife
because
subsequently
in
talking
about
the
interrogation
the
following
morning,
he
indicated
that
he
had
mentally
changed
his
mind
about
wanting
permission
to
call
an
attorney
directly,
but
wanted
to
get
his
wife
--
going
to
call
his
wife
so
that
she
could
contact
an
attorney.
he
raised
the
question
that
he
didn't
want
to
have
two
attorneys
coming
in
at
the
same
time
that
if
he
got
one
and
his
wife
got
one,
he
would
have
the
problem
of
paying
two
attorneys.
however,
he
indicated
that
was
a
mental
thought
process
that
he
went
through
rather
than
anything
that
he
stated,
but
there
is
no
flat
denial
on
the
part
of
the
--
any
of
the
police
that
he
made
such
request
to
call.
both
lieutenant
wakeley
that
evening
and
officer
cockburn
who
interrogated
the
following
morning
stated
in
a
somewhat
similar
terms
that
they
could
not
remember
whether
he
made
such
request
that
he
might
have
in
one
case
or
that
he
could
have
stated
by
officer
cockburn.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
yes,
it
does
and
it
didn't
in
this
case.
there
was
a
lineup
at
11
o'clock
that
evening
which
was
approximately
an
hour
after
he
got
to
the
police
station
and
he
was
booked
at
that
point
after
the
lineup
that
he
was
--
in
which
there
was
--
his
name
was
placed
in
what
was
called
the
small
book.
the
--
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
there
was
any
interrogation
after
midnight
of
that
evening.
apparently,
he
was
sent
over
to
the
county
jail,
and
the
next
morning,
he
was
brought
back
to
the
police
station
at
9
o'clock.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
lieutenant
wakeley
testified
that
he
confessed
to
him
orally
that
he
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well,
the
interrogation
occupied
about
an
hour
so
it
was
sometime
during
that
period
of
time.
i
don't
know
whether
--
i
don't
believe
it's
indicated
in
the
record
how
soon
after
the
interrogation
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
no,
there
is
not.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that's
going
to
indicate
that
he
first
stated
that
he
wanted
to
call
the
wife
before
confessing.
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
--
excuse
me,
lieutenant
wakeley
testified
that
after
what
he
described
as
his
conversation
with
him
that
he
then
requested
permission
to
call
his
wife.
lieutenant
--
but
the
petitioner
in
his
testimony
stated
that
he
asked
several
times
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
he
does
not
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
he
does
not
state
when
it
was
in
the
record.
on
the
following
morning,
two
detectives
interrogated
the
petitioner,
officers
cockburn
and
peck.
he
was
fingerprinted.
their
interrogation
occupied
from
one
hour
and
a
half
to
two
hours.
he
again
asked
to
call
his
wife.
officer
cockburn
in
his
testimony
stated,
he
doesn't
remember
whether
he
did,
he
could
have.
also,
he
asked
to
talk
to
the
prosecutor
before
his
--
while
his
confession
was
being
taken
down
by
a
stenographer
and
this
request
was
refused
by
officer
cockburn.
there's
no
indi
--
there's
no
indication
in
the
confession
which
was
taken
down
by
a
stenographer
that
he
was
advised
of
his
constitutional
rights
was
nothing
in
the
record
that
any
time
indicated
that
this
occurred.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
confession,
he
was
asked,
“have
we
made
you
any
threats
or
promises?”
and
he
answered
“no”.
“has
any
police
officer
made
you
any
promises
or
threats?”
he
stated,
“no,
except
that
the
lieutenant
promised
me
that
as
soon
as
i
was
booked
that
i
could
call
my
wife.”
and
detective
cockburn
replied,
“you
are
being
held
for
investigation.
you
haven't
been
booked
yet.
when
you
are,
you
will
be
able
to
phone
your
wife.”
after
this
confession
was
taken
down
by
a
stenographer,
he
was
taken
to
the
assistant
prosecutor's
office,
mr.
gray.
there
is
some
ambiguity
in
the
record
as
to
when
he
signed
the
confession
at
prosecutor
gray's
office.
the
majority
opinion
of
the
washington
supreme
court
stated
it
was
around
noon.
however,
in
the
record,
there
is
a
notation
which
hasn't
been
brought
to
the
court's
attention
in
any
of
the
briefs
which
states
1:47
p.m.
and
initials
r.l.h.
which
i
assume
refers
to
raymond
l.
haynes,
the
name
of
the
petitioner.
in
any
case,
the
confession
was
signed
by
the
petitioner
sometime
either
at
noon
or
one
--
at
1:47
p.m.
in
the
meantime,
his
wife
had
called
the
police
department
and
asked
if
her
husband
was
in
jail.
she
was
told
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
it
was
two
and
a
half
hours
the
night
before
so
it'd
be
fourteen-and-a-half
hours
from
the
date
of
--
from
the
time
of
arrest
until
they
signed
a
confession,
and
noon
was
the
time
for
--
it
was
1:47
would
be
another
two
hour
--
one
and
three
quarter
hours.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
how
much
sleep
he
had.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
he
was
subjected
to
all
night
interrogation.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
or
anything
similar
to
that.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
there
is
a
blank.
he
was
taken
from
the
police
station
to
the
county
jail.
there
have
been
situations
where
there
has
been
interrogation
which
is
going
on
at
the
county
jail
by
police
officers.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
that
occurred
in
this
--
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
yes,
in
the
record
on
--
for
exhibit
6
on
page
139,
you
will
see
subscribed
and
sworn
to
before
me
this
20th
day
of
december,
1957,
carol
d.
gray,
harry
h.
cockburn,
who
is
one
of
the
detectives.
then
on
the
left
hand
side
it
says
6
am-pm
with
no
indication
as
to
what
that
means
and
rlh,
12/20/57,
1:47
p.m.
and
i
--
again,
i
can't
tell
whether
that
means
that
he
in
fact
did
sign
it
at
that
time
and
that
this
is
his
initials
to
indicate
that
but
there
is
--
there
is
nothing
else
to
indicate
the
specific
time
other
than
the
statement
in
the
majority
opinion
of
the
washington
state
supreme
court
that
it
was
around
noon.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well,
in
the
--
in
exhibit
6
which
is
the
signed
confession
on
page
138
of
the
record,
it
states,
“has
any
police
officers
made
any
promises
or
threats?”
“no
except
that
the
lieutenant
promised
me
that
as
soon
as
i
was
booked,
i
could
call
my
wife.”
question:
“you're
being
held
for
investigation,
you
haven't
been
booked
yet,
when
you
are,
you
will
be
able
to
phone
your
wife,”
the
last
sentence
of
the
--
of
this
signed
confession.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
yes,
it
did.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
yes,
it
did
and
a
motion
to
strike
the
confession
was
made
which
i'll
come
to
as
i
get
to
that
point.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
if
we
accept
the
12
noon,
if
we
accept
the
1:47,
it's
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
then
i
--
i
would
say
it's
close
to
16
hours.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
no.
it
is
not.
at
least
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
there
is
--
there
apparently
was
no
interrogation
after
12
midnight
until
9
o'clock
the
next
morning.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
it.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
yes.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
then
the
following
morning,
there
was
interrogation
of
an
hour
and
a
half
to
two
hours.
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
i
think
there
are
some
aspects
of
that
in
this
case,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
go
that
far
though.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
i
don't
believe
that
you
do
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
there
are
--
for
example,
the
mallory
rule
would
be
applicable
in
barring
a
confession
even
though
there
were
probable
cause
in
an
arrest,
but
there
was
an
unlawful
detention
by
the
fact
that
the
person
who
was
not
brought
before
a
magistrate
without
unnecessary
delay.
but
in
this
case,
i
believe
that,
as
i'll
get
to,
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
so
that
you
don't
have
that
specific
problem
before
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well,
no,
because
under
the
mallory
rule,
confessions
are
barred
if
they're
obtained
during
a
period
of
unlawful
detention
even
though
it's
a
completely
voluntary
confession.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well,
but
in
this
case,
we
have
under
the
traditional
test
it
seems
--
and
which
was
argued
in
the
--
in
the
brief
in
chief
that
looking
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
you
have
enough
here
to
show
an
extraction
of
the
confession
by
impermissible
constitutional
means
which
is
an
irrelevant
consideration
under
the
mallory
rule.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
yes.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
first
of
all,
he
was
held
incommunicado.
under
mallory
rule,
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
he
was
held
incommunicado.
he
could
have
been
in
the
police
station,
could've
called
a
thousand
people,
it
wouldn't
have
mattered.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
so
being
held
incommunicado,
it
was
in
violation
of
a
state
law.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
but
the
state
laws
may
vary
but
this
happens
to
be
a
specific
state
law
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
no,
it's
slightly
different
than
a
prompt
arraignment
law.
this
was
a
state
--
this
is
a
state
law
which
is
in
the
record
which
states
that
it's
a
misdemeanor
for
a
police
officer
to
refuse
permission
on
the
part
of
any
person
being
held
in
a
jail
to
communicate
with
a
friend,
relative,
or
an
attorney
for
the
purpose
of
extracting
a
confession.
now,
the
state
supreme
court
held
that
to
bar
this
confession
in
a
sense
so
that
it
should
not
have
been
presented
to
the
jury
to
determine
voluntariness,
there
should
have
been
an
additional
factor
found
which
was
that
the
--
this
holding
incommunicado,
violation
of
this
law
induced
the
confession.
however,
that's
an
additional
requirement
it
seems
to
me
that
for
the
state
--
if
that
is
the
state
law,
that
is
--
it
doesn't
cover
the
situation
as
to
whether
the
police,
in
fact,
were
guilty
of
violating
their
own
state
law
of
misdemeanor.
that's
only
a
question
of
the
introduction
of
evidence,
not
the
question
as
to
whether
they
in
fact
broke
a
state
penal
law.
and
in
addition,
the
mallory
rule
is
--
it
doesn't
consider
the
question
as
to
whether
a
person
is
informed
of
his
constitutional
rights.
that's
in
the
district
of
columbia
since
the
mallory
case.
the
police
have
stated
that
they
generally,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
universal,
do
inform
an
individual
prior
to
the
time
that
the
confession
is
obtained
to
--
from
him
but
he
doesn't
have
to
answer
the
question.
but
this
is
not
required
by
the
mallory
rule.
this
is
a
circumstance
that
exists
in
this
case
and
it's
looked
and
i
would
say,
fits
in
within
this
total
concept
of
looking
at
all
the
facts.
in
some
of
the
cases
that
the
court
has
considered
in
coerced
confession
situations,
they've
spelled
out
generally
the
factors
of
this
kind
as
being
the
use
of
impermissible
methods.
and
they
haven't
done
it
entirely
or
they
haven't
done
on
the
basis
of
mcnabb-mallory
which
has
been
an
exclusionary
rule
based
on
a
supervisorial
power
of
the
court.
i
agree,
it
approaches
close
to
mcnabb-mallory
but
i
think
that
the
limits
in
the
--
and
the
scope
of
it
will
be
different
under
particular
circumstances.
the
wife
in
this
case
testified
that
she
called
the
police,
attempted
to
find
out
information
about
her
husband,
but
was
told
that
it
was
all
in
the
morning
papers,
to
get
the
papers
and
read
it.
she
testified
that
she
came
the
following
day
on
a
saturday
and
picked
up
the
car,
and
testified
that
she
was
not
permitted
to
see
him
until
a
week
after
his
arrest.
he
testified
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
call
his
wife
until
either
five
or
seven
days
after
the
arrest.
after
signing
the
confession,
he
was
brought
before
a
magistrate
at
4
o'clock
of
that
afternoon
which
is
some
eighteen
and
a
half
hours
after
the
arrest
where
he
was
first
informed
of
his
constitutional
rights.
after
that,
he
was
brought
to
the
prosecutor's
office
on
several
occasions
and
was
asked
to
sign
new
statements
and
he
refused
to
do
it
in
his
testimony
on
the
grounds
that
he
had
not
been
permitted
to
call
his
wife.
it's
i
think
pertinent
to
point
out
that
he
has
a
prior
criminal
record.
this
was
brought
out
during
the
trial
when
he
took
the
stand
and
the
evidence
was
given
that
he
had
been
convicted
at
prior
times
of
robbery,
breaking
and
entering
which
was
a
gross
misdemeanor
in
the
state,
drunken
driving,
resisting
arrest,
and
taking
a
car
without
permission,
and
breaking
jail.
he
was
given
a
sentence
not
exceeding
20
years
after
being
found
guilty
by
the
jury.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
no,
he
--
no,
he
did
not.
he
signed
only
this
one
confession.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
no.
there
was
the
oral
testimony
of
the
police
officers
about
his
oral
confessions
and
then
this
one
confession,
signed
confession
was
introduced
over
objection
of
the
--
of
his
defense
attorney.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
yes
or
16.
that
was
1:47.
at
the
trial,
his
counsel
moved
to
strike
the
confession
on
several
grounds,
but
the
pertinent
one
here
was
that
on
--
that
on
the
grounds
that
raymond
haynes'
rights
under
the
constitution,
would
be
violated
by
these
introductions
with
regard
to
self-incrimination
and
enforces
him
to
take
the
witness
stand
against
himself
and
against
his
will.
now,
the
state
supreme
court
over
the
contention
of
the
state,
interpreted
this
to
mean
as
being
an
objection
that
its
introduction
would
violate
his
rights
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
state
supreme
court
then
decided
whether
the
introduction
of
this
confession
into
his
case
did
violate
his
rights
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
by
five
to
four
majority
held
that
it
did
not.
and
it
was
this
--
the
question
of
introduction
of
this
confession
was
the
thrust
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
i
believe
there
was
--
there
was
argument
in
the
chambers
of
the
judge
on
the
admissibility
of
this
confession
and
the
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
no,
i
believe
so
--
i
believe
not
it
was
before,
it
was
beforehand.
when
it
--
excuse
me,
no.
the
evidence
i
believe
was
heard
before
then
there
was
a
motion
--
an
argument
in
the
judges'
chambers
on
its
admissibility.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
yes,
they
did.
now,
the
argument
that
was
made
in
the
brief-in-chief
was
on
the
exclusion
of
this
confession
on
the
grounds
that
it
violated
the
petitioner's
rights
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
denying
him
fundamental
fairness.
now,
this
has
been
expressed
in
various
ways
by
the
court
to
whether
the
confession
is
involuntary,
whether
it
was
obtained
as
a
result
of
coercion
or
whether
it's
a
combination
of
factors,
including
the
extraction
of
it
by
impermissible
means
plus
the
compulsion
that
should
prevent
--
that
was
--
the
fifth
amendment
was
designed
to
prevent.
it
is
clear
that
the
trustworthiness,
the
truth
of
the
confession
is
not
the
proper
issue
in
determining
its
admissibility.
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
this
confession
was
obtained
under
a
regular
practice
and
procedure
of
the
spokane
police
department.
this
is
not
a
case
of
the
constable
blundering.
this
is
a
case
of
an
established
police
practice
not
only
in
spokane,
but
throughout
the
country.
the
uniform
crime
reports,
the
last
one
in
1961
indicated,
for
example,
that
there
are
136,000
arrests
on
suspicion
or
investigation,
they
used
it
somewhat
synonymously,
in
which
individuals
are
arrested
sufficiently
so
that
the
statistics
are
reported
to
the
department
of
justice
and
the
fbi
and
are
collected.
and
that
those
people
have
been
arrested
and
are
never
brought
before
a
magistrate
but
are
released
without
a
charge.
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
last
year,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
attention
on
this
question
and
there
were
approximately
6000
arrests
for
investigation
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
have
in
mcnabb-mallory
rule
which
is
applicable
in
the
district
of
columbia,
but
in
the
spokane
police
department,
this
was
an
established
practice.
they
even
had
a
name
for
it.
it
was
the
small
book
that
if
a
person
wasn't
charged
with
a
crime,
he
was
held
for
investigation.
there
was
nothing
to
take
him
before
a
magistrate
because
a
magistrate
would
--
function
at
that
point
would
be
to
determine
if
there
was
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
and
of
course
there's
no
probable
cause
which
could
be
determined
if
the
person
is
merely
brought
before
a
magistrate
having
been
arrested
for
investigation,
having
been
booked
for
investigation.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well,
i
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well,
this
is
--
this
is
part
of
that
case,
mr.
justice
stewart,
because
here
is
a
situation
where
they
picked
someone
up
and
i
disagree
that
they
had
probable
cause
to
pick
him
up.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
they
knew
a
service
station
has
been
robbed.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
and
they
knew
that
a
felony
had
occurred
and
this
is
true
and
i
would
say
in
almost
all
of
the
cases
where
people
are
arrested
on
suspicion
but
no
crime
has
been
committed
and
they
pick
people
up
in
order
to
extract
from
them
confessions
which
is
going
to
be
the
basis
for
a
conviction.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well,
i
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
that
does
make
a
difference
if
that
is
the
proper
construction
of
the
evidence.
however,
there
have
been
cases
that
have
been
decided
which
hold
that
mere
submissiveness
is
not
a
surrender
or
does
not
waive
the
rights
to
object
to
an
arrest
without
probable
cause.
in
the
district
of
columbia,
there
was
a
court
of
appeals
decision
in
which
the
court's,
kelley
versus
united
states,
298
f.2d
310,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“it
is
sufficient
if
the
person
arrested
understands
that
he
is
in
the
power
of
the
one
arresting
and
submits
in
consequence.”
and
in
the
ray
case
in
this
court,
the
court
stated,
“it
is
the
right
of
one
placed
under
arrest
to
submit
to
custody.
probable
cause
cannot
be
found
from
submissiveness.”
now,
here,
i
agree
that
there
is
a
problem
here
as
to
what
actually
happened
at
the
time
of
arrest.
i
believe
a
reasonable
construction
though
is
this.
here,
is
a
situation
of
a
man
who
had
been
stopped
on
a
street
corner.
as
far
as
the
police
were
concerned
at
that
point
they
had
no
probable
cause
to
hold
that
man
for
the
crime
--
for
whose
solution
that
they
were
working.
he
didn't
quite
fit
the
subscription
--
the
description.
that
the
description
was
vague
and
uncertain
and
they
let
him
go.
but
they
were
suspicious,
not
probable
cause
but
suspicious.
so
they
sat
there
and
watched.
they
waited.
they
watched
and
go
up
to
the
house
and
then
he
fumbled
with
the
key
and
he
came
back
down.
now
i
believe
a
reasonable
construction
is
he
never
really
was
free
to
go
at
that
point,
that
they
sat
there
and
watched,
and
he
was
like
--
he
was
on
the
end
of
a
rubber
band.
they
watched
him
go
up
to
the
door
and
they
pulled
him
back
in.
he
could
not
have
walked
by
the
police
car,
i
believe
that
--
and
officer
usher
testified
that
he
got
out
of
the
car
and
arrested
him.
now,
i
agree
there
is
some
ambiguity
here
as
to
whether
he
got
out
of
the
car,
when
the
man
was
walking
back,
and
therefore
went
to
meet
him.
but
i
believe
that
the
man
was
not
free
to
walk
down
from
the
house
and
then
walk
away
that
the
police
are
waiting
for
him
and
that
his
statement,
“you
got
me,
let's
go”,
is
merely
an
acknowledgment,
“you've
got
me.
i
am
under
--
i'm
under
arrest.”
and
his
testimony
says
he
saw
they
were
waiting
out
there
and
decided
--
he
gave
up
the
ghost
and
he
--
he
walked
back
down.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
this
is
our
position
but
i
am
not
relying
on
that
alone.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
but
--
yes.
yes.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
i
think
on
that
point,
i
probably
have
to
rely
on
the
fatality
concept
and
say
this
would
be
one
major
factor.
there
have
been
statements
by
the
court
which
--
in
which
it
has
said
that
anyone
of
these
factors
would
be
sufficient
but
this
has
been
a
dictum,
there
hasn't
yet
in
a
case
it
was
written.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
[inaudible]
to
chenny,
i
quite
agree.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well,
i
regard
that
to
be
a
critical
element
--
i
--
but
i
would
also
go
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
i
believe
that
a
confession
obtained
from
someone
who
is
held
incommunicado
which
i
believe
would
be
a
shorthand
way
of
describing
what
you've
asked
me,
should
be
excluded
under
the
fourteenth
amendment's
due
process
clause
on
that
factor
alone.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
oh,
the
reason
that
point
is
here
is
that
on
january
17,
i
believe
it
was,
this
court
decided
wong
sun
versus
united
states
holding
that
confessions
that
are
obtained
after
an
arrest
without
probable
cause
are
excludable
under
the
exclusionary
principle
as
applied
to
the
federal
government
which
is
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
no,
but
there
--
you
have
--
this
issue
has
come
up
in
other
ways.
it's
principally
come
up
since
mapp
versus
ohio
where
the
issue
has
come
up
as
to
what
has
happened
to
defendants
who
have
been
tried
and
have
not
made
a
motion
to
strike,
evidence
obtained
as
a
result
of
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
and
the
last
expression
that
i've
seen
on
this
was
a
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
what
--
mr.
justice
white,
if
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
this
is
a
direct
appeal,
but
in
the
orderly
administration
of
justice,
if
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
he
should
now
--
that
you
should
then
uphold
the
conviction,
send
it
back
down
then
to
file
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
raise
that
ground
fair,
it
seems
to
me
is
a
needless
waste
of
time
in
the
case
where
the
record
clearly
indicates
all
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
they
might
have
--
they
might
have
considered
it,
but
i
think
that
it's
unrealistic
to
say
that
the
law
has
not
changed
since
the
supreme
court
of
washington
has
looked
at
the
case.
in
a
fourth
circuit
decision
last
month,
hall
versus
warden
before,
there
was
a
--
this
question
came
up.
shouldn't
he
--
shouldn't
the
individual
have
made
a
motion
to
exclude
illegally
obtained
--
evidence
obtained
by
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
in
a
trial
--
a
state
court
trial
in
maryland,
the
case
was
taken
on
up
to
this
court
then
he
filed
habeas
corpus.
chief
judge
sobeloff
said,
“well,
not
only
it
would
have
been
useless
for
the
defense
attorney
to
have
made
such
a
motion
on
such
a
ground
considering
the
fact
that
wolff
versus
[inaudible]
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well,
there
have
been
cases
where
this
court
has
taken
up
issues
that
were
--
that
were
existing
in
the
record
even
though
motions
had
not
been
made
specifically
on
those
issues
in
the
court
below.
there
was
a
motion
which
was
interpreted
by
the
court,
by
the
washington
state
supreme
court
that
he
contended
the
admission
of
his
confession
into
his
trial,
denied
him
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
there
are
some
members
of
the
court
who
feel
that
there
isn't
any
incorporation
of
fourth,
fifth,
sixth
amendments
into
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
these
are
facets
of
due
process.
and
that
the
major
contention
is
that
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
the
criteria
to
be
determined.
now,
it's
certainly
preferable,
i
quite
agree
that
when
there
is
--
when
you're
coming
up
to
the
supreme
court
that
you
should
specify
with
--
as
much
particularity
as
possible
in
what
way
something
violates
the
due
process
clause
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
the
federal
constitutional
ground
was
raised
and
there
have
been
cases
before
this
court
in
which
the
federal
constitutional
grounds
were
not
raised
and
yet
this
court
has
considered
them
in
their
decisions.
there
were
some
questions
for
example
in
mapp
versus
ohio
whether
the
federal
issue
was
properly
raised.
in
eaton
versus
price,
there
was
some
question
that
was
upheld
by
an
equally
divided
court.
terminiello
versus
chicago,
there
was
some
question
about
that
as
to
whether
a
question
was
properly
raised,
but
here
there
hasn't
been
a
change
in
the
law
made
by
wong
sun
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
sufficient
reason
for
this
court
to
consider
it
on
the
record.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
in
this
case
a
number
of
factors
that
the
court
has
considered
in
the
past
in
other
cases.
the
difficulty
with
applying
a
subjective
rule
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
voluntary
confession
or
a
coerced
confession
is
highlighted
by
this
case
just
in
the
fact
that
the
two
brothers,
one
of
whom
had
no
criminal
experience
before
and
was
belligerent
as
testified
by
the
police
officer
refused
to
confess
at
first.
and
this
man
who
had
had
a
prior
criminal
experience
at
some
length,
confessed
initially
and
then
confessed
before
his
brother.
therefore,
i
think
the
subjective
rule
or
the
subjective
factor
is
not
a
good
basis
in
which
to
determine
the
inadmissibility
of
a
confession.
by
looking
at
the
objective
facts
as
to
what
the
police
did
and
whether
their
methods
were
impermissible
under
the
standards
of
a
civilized
society,
i
think
will
give
a
standard
here,
a
more
exact
standard,
in
determining
the
admissibility
of
the
confession.
here,
the
police
did
hold
the
man
incommunicado
and
they
did
it
for
a
purpose.
and
the
purpose
was
to
nail
the
case
down.
and
they
continued
to
attempt
to
nail
the
case
down
not
only
after
getting
the
signed
confession
in
the
interrogation
room
of
the
police
department
but
there
was
also
subsequent
attempt
to
get
succeeding
confessions
signed
before
the
prosecutor.
the
police
admit
they
have
this
practice.
i
think
that
--
to
suggest
that
the
man
could
have
made
phone
calls
before
he
was
placed
on
small
book
would
--
is
totally
unrealistic.
i
think
the
small
book
is
merely
an
expression
of
police
department
policy
but
as
far
as
police
department
practice
is
concerned,
it's
fairly
evident
that
this
man
could
not
have
made
a
phone
call
out
anytime
until
he
was
booked.
now,
it's
been
suggested
that
at
first,
that
he
could
--
that
they
were
awaiting
to
present
this
to
the
prosecutor.
however,
it's
to
be
noted
that
he
wasn't
brought
before
a
magistrate
until
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
yes,
and
this
appears
in
the
written
confession
itself.
there
are
some
things
we
don't
know
about
what
was
said
in
the
interrogation
by
this
man
by
the
police
officer
since
there
was
no
secretary
present
and
this
was
not
taken
down,
but
in
the
written
confession
itself,
there
was
a
request
by
him
to
see
the
prosecutor.
now,
spokane
is
like
most
that
is
i
assumed
that
the
magistrate
was
available
at
ten
o'clock
or
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning,
the
following
morning
after
his
arrest.
nevertheless,
he
was
not
brought
before
a
magistrate
at
that
time
when
he
could
have
been
informed
of
his
rights.
he
could
have
at
that
point,
attempted
to
contact
an
attorney
perhaps
although
we
can't
tell
for
sure
from
this
record
whether
this
was
possible
simply
because
of
the
fact
that
he
wasn't
able
to
--
as
he
can
testify
to
contact
an
attorney
for
or
to
contact
his
wife
to
contact
an
attorney
for
several
days
after
the
confession.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well,
i
think
it
can
be
done
in
several
fashions,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
it
can
be
done
in
the
way
the
court
has
looked
at
the
cases
in
the
past
in
looking
at
a
totality
of
circumstances
and
seeing
whether
the
totality
adds
up
to
some
impermissible
method.
this
would
involve
looking
at
the
factors
of
the
incommunicado
detention.
it
would
look
at
the
factors
of
not
bringing
before
a
magistrate.
it
would
look
at
the
factor
of
not
advising
the
individual
of
his
constitutional
rights.
it
would
look
at
the
factor
of
whether
he
had
counsel
to
advice
him,
if
he
requests
a
counsel
at
any
time
before
signing
a
confession.
i
also
urge
the
court
that
it
could
be
done
on
anyone
of
these
factors.
there
was
a
statement
in
the
case
of
ward
versus
texas
which
indicates
this
but
as
yet
the
court
has
not
made
any
ruling
on
that
one
score.
and
the
cases
that
have
come
up
to
the
court
in
which
the
particular
emphasis
has
been
on
the
--
that
facet
of
the
due
process
clause
involving
the
right
to
counsel
in
cicenia
versus
lagay
and
crooker
versus
california.
the
court
has
not
been
--
was
not
willing
to
rely
on
that
one
factor
alone
which
was
the
only
factor
that
raised
this
constitutional
issue
before
the
court.
but
those
cases,
perhaps,
can
be
distinguishable
although
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart
yesterday,
i
urge
that
they'd
be
overruled.
they
can
be
distinguished,
i
believe,
on
the
grounds
that
in
both
cases,
in
crooker,
there
was
evident
in
the
record
that
he
had
been
advised
of
his
right
to
refuse
to
answer
questions
and
that
the
statements
would
be
used
against
him.
also,
there
was
that
very
unique
circumstance
that
he
had
attended
law
school
and
presumably
therefore
knew
what
his
rights
were.
in
cicenia,
there
was
a
similar
awareness
of
rights
and
there
was
a
contact
with
an
attorney,
with
an
assumption
that
an
attorney
had,
in
fact,
consulted
with
him
prior
to
his
surrender
at
the
police
station.
now,
in
both
of
those
cases,
it
seem
to
me
that
one
of
these
facets
that
i've
mentioned
has
had
been
satisfied
as
far
as
the
courts
are
concerned.
and
i
suggest
that
this
is
a
distinction
in
--
as
far
as
those
two
cases
are
concerned.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
here
to
indicate
that
this
man
had
an
opportunity
to
consult
with
an
attorney,
to
talk
with
an
attorney
before
he
confessed.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
i
--
i
agree.unfortunately,
there
was
no
objection
to
this
instruction,
as
far
i
could
tell
from
the
lower
court
record,
however,
i'd
like
to
point
out
in
the
case
of
terminiello
versus
chicago,
the
court
decided
that
case
based
on
a
faulty
instruction
that
was
not
objected
to
in
the
trial
court,
was
not
considered
in
the
state
courts
before
it
reached
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
and
i
--
and
i
am
suggesting
that
the
--
that
position
i
have
taken
in
response
to
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question
is
slightly
different.
i
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
i
would
even
suggest
eliminating
the
word
“voluntary”
as
a
needlessly
confusing
term
to
define
to
determine
whether
confessions
should
be
admitted
which
have
been
obtained
by
impermissible
methods
in
line
with
civilized
society
standards.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
yes.
obviously
the
prophylaxis
of
the
--
of
the
exclusionary
principle
is
something
i'm
urging
before
the
state.
it
has
been
adopted
by
mapp
versus
ohio
in
applying
as
far
as
one
facet
of
the
fourteenth
amendment's
due
process
clause
illegally
--
unreasonably
search
and
seizure
evidence
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
no,
there
are
--
there
were
--
there
are
several
factors,
it
seems
to
me,
in
the
adoption
of
the
exclusionary
rule
which
have
been
--
were
referred
to
in
mapp
versus
ohio
and
in
other
cases
in
which
they
come
up.
there
has
--
it
has
been
suggested,
it
has
a
deterrent
effect
on
the
police
and
this
has
been
mentioned
in
determining
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
had
a
constitutional
basis.
but
in
addition
to
that,
there
was
the
factor
of
whether
the
courts
are
going
to
become
part
of
governmental
lawlessness
that
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
procedure
was
at
stake
and
for
this
court
to
uphold
the
utilization
in
a
trial
of
evidence
obtained
by
unconstitutional
methods
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
yes.
i
--
i'm
suggesting
that
these
two
reasons
have
been
both
been
stressed
and
i
recognized
that
some
justices
prefer
one
reason
rather
than
the
other
but
they
have
--
are
both
apparently
appear
--
appeared
in
the
cases
that
have
discussed
the
reason
for
the
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
yes.
and
i
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
court
ignored
the
judicial
restraint
which
is
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well,
the
definiteness
of
that
has
been
subject
to
too
much
criticism
and
an
easy
answer
then
would
be
the
civilized
standards
or
whether
there's
been
a
violation
of
the
constitution
in
some
fashion
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
i'm
always
willing
to
try
to
suit
you,
justice
black.
the
exclusionary
rule
has
had
a
benefit
on
police
lawlessness.
there
--
were
refusing
cries
about
the
mallory-mcnabb
rule
and
i
realized
that
that
was
based
on
the
supervisorial
capacity
of
the
court
over
the
--
over
the
federal
courts.
but
in
spite
of
the
cries
that
the
adoption
of
mcnabb-mallory
rule
would
prevent
efficient
law
enforcement,
efficient
law
enforcement
has
gone
on
within
the
district
of
columbia.
oliver
gasch
who
was
formally
the
u.s.
attorney
here
indicated
that
that
was
only
an
issue
in
approximately
5%
of
the
cases
and
it
has
had
some
effect
on
the
police
practices
here
to
the
extent
that
arrests
for
investigation
are
to
be
ended
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
after
a
thorough
study
by
indicating
that
they
were
unconstitutional.
the
effect
of
mapp
versus
ohio
is
completely
still
too
early
to
say,
however,
the
benefit
of
experience
in
the
states
that
have
the
exclusionary
rule
indicated
that
it
had
a
beneficial
effect.
but
we
have
had,
in
the
courts
since
1936,
a
series
of
so-called
coerced
confession
cases
in
which
they
have
been
earmarked
by
arrest
on
suspicion,
incommunicado
interrogation
which
involves
refusal
to
permit
contact
with
friends
and
relatives,
no
informing
of
rights
to
silence
in
the
counsel,
delay
in
bringing
before
magistrates
and
a
denial
of
bail
and
a
denial
of
writ
of
habeas
corpus
during
that
interim
period.
the
governments
and
the
states
have
in
effect
become
lawbreakers
and
there's
a
very
intimate
relationship
between
the
willingness
of
the
people
to
observe
laws
and
their
cynicism
which
will
develop
if
they
feel
that
the
government
itself
is
a
lawbreaker.
justice
brandeis
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
olmstead,
it
seems
to
me,
made
the
most
eloquent
statement
as
to
the
value
of
this.
to
declare
that
in
the
administration
of
the
criminal
law,
the
end
justifies
the
means.
to
declare
that
the
government
may
commit
crimes
in
order
to
secure
the
conviction
of
a
private
criminal
would
bring
terrible
retribution.
against
that
pernicious
doctrine,
this
court
should
resolutely
set
its
base.
