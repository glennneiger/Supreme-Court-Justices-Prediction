justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
he
testify?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
pardon
me
but,
i
thought
at
the
end
of
the
written
confession,
the
questions
and
answers,
there
was
a
statement
by
him
that
he
had
to
--
they
had
promised
that
they
would
call
his
wife.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
doesn't
--
i
just
didn't
quite
understand
it,
how
you
reconcile
with
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
the
--
what
did
the
officers
say
about
this
part
of
the
confession
where
he
had
said
that
he
has
been
told
that
he
could
call
his
wife
after
he
confess
or
whatever
it
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the
officers
--
what
did
the
officers
say
in
response
to
that,
this
part
of
the
confession?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understood
you
to
say
a
moment
ago
that
the
officer
had
told
him
that
he
could
not
call
his
wife
until
he
was
booked.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
that
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
that
language
but
didn't
you
say
that
he
was
--
what
--
what
was
meant
by
booking?
how
long
was
he
going
to
wait?
how
long
do
they
hold
him
of
that
booking?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
when
they
have
told
him
as
you
said
it
is,
he
couldn't
call
his
wife
until
after
he
was
booked,
what
was
the
impression
left
by
that
as
to
what
booking
meant
and
when
it
did
take
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
because
it's
--
and
reading
it
in
context
of
what
you
have
said,
occurred
to
me
that
it
meant
that
when
they
got
to
the
question,
he
need
be
booked.
is
that
about
the
thing
he
does?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
your
practice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
practice
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
time
this
happened
it
was
the
practice
to
hold
him,
not
book
him
until
after
they
interrogated
him.
so,
they
either
got
a
confession
or
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
wouldn't
that
--
doesn't
that
--
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
it
but
i
--
reading
it,
i
read
it,
i
drew
the
impression
what
you
meant
--
what
was
meant
by
that
when
the
officer
said
that
context
of
what
was
said
in
the
context
to
what
the
petitioner
said
that
the
--
was
denied
by
anybody
so
far
--
that's
all.
that
it
meant
that
after
they
got
through
with
him,
that
he
confessed,
he'd
be
--
or
if
they
reached
the
conclusion
he
would
never
confess
that
he
might
be
able
to
call
his
wife.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
were
--
they
were
holding
him
and
asked
him
a
lot
more
after
he
had
confess,
what
we
are
holding,
want
to
keep
on
asking
questions
on
that
if
he'd
already
confessed
twice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
make
it
three
times
that's
famous
in
history
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
charge
makes
a
distinct
--
this
distinction,
as
i
read
it,
am
i
correct
in
that,
that
if
there
had
been
so
many
threats,
the
jury
was
instructed
that
they
could
not
use
the
evidence
against
him,
you're
not
considering
that.
but
that
if
they
had
offered
inducements
for
him
to
confess,
it
could
be
used
as
evidence
against
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
i
was
talking
about
the
two,
just
divided,
the
charge
divided,
the
jury
--
jurisprudence
in
two
parts:
(a)
if
the
threat
--
if
they
have
found
that
the
threat
discretion
had
been
induced
by
threats
of
violence
or
threats,
then
they
couldn't
use
it
against
him
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
it
was
induced
by
promises
or
hope
of
reward,
then
they
could
use
it
against
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
different
distinction
being
if
--
they
could
consider
their
confession
even
though
it's
induced
by
promises,
but
they
could
not
sustain
a
conviction
unless
there
was
corroborating
testimony
about
it.

i've
never

one
exactly
like
it,

indicated.
justice

were
they
permitted
to
do

did
not.
justice

may
i
ask
you
regarding
the
verdict
of
this
crime,
what
kind
of
case
did
you
have
against
the
man
without
the
confession?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
testify?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
say,
aside
from
the
confessions,
you
say
you
had
one
witness
that
identified
him
to
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
since
died
then
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
partial
evidence
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
identify
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
both
of
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
you
couldn't
find
anything
in
the
wife's
testimony?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
find
a
--
any
statement
where
you've
said,
is
this
the
man
and
she
said,
yes.
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
crucial
in
this
case,
i
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
just
curious
as
to
why
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(inaudible)
confession
if
you
have
a
good
case
without
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
joined
issue
with
the
statement
of
a
dissent
on
page
150,
do
you
not?
had
the
court
said
that
--
the
judge
said
that
the
appellant
was
allowed
to
communicate
with
anyone
not
--
were
not
allowed
to
communicate
with
anyone
outside
despite
his
repeated
request
to
do
so.
and
the
appellant's
wife
had
telephoned
at
city
jail
where
he
was
incarcerated
to
refuse
any
information
at
that
time
except
the
fact
that
he
was
being
held.
the
following
day,
decided
it,
she
called
at
the
jail
in
the
futile
attempt
to
see
him
not
successful
until
thursday,
december
26,
one
full
week
after
the
arrest.
do
you
think
the
record
does
not
bear
that
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
also
join
the
issue
with
the
statement
that
during
the
time
he
was
being
held,
he
begged
for
the
opportunity
of
talking
to
the
prosecutor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
wasn't
based
on
the
idea,
was
it,
that
if
you
--
that
we
had
to
sit
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
conduct
opposed
--
violated
civilized
standards.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
quite
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
if
we
would
hold
as
a
general
rule
as
we
could
upset
any
state
law,
any
state
action
at
anytime
on
our
basis
of
whether
or
not
it
violated
civilized
standards,
there
would
be
some
question
about
the
lawlessness
or
the
lawfulness
of
our
conduct,
would
there
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
judicial
restraint.
i'm
talking
about
interpretation
whether
you
--
interpreting
the
constitution
according
to
this
language
or
introducing
a
new
factor
rather
what
the
court
thinks
it
violates
civilized
standards.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
--
suits
to
be
better.
