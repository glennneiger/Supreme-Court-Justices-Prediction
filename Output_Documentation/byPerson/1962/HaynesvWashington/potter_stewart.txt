potter
stewart
did
the
evidence
show
whose
house
it
was?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
his
house
or
a
relative's
house
or
a
stranger's
house?
justice
potter
stewart
how
much
sleep
did
he
get
to
this?
justice
potter
stewart
or
anything
similar
to
that?
justice
potter
stewart
this
--
i
want
to
be
sure
how
much
time
was
involved
here.
it
was
approximately
a
14-hour
period.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
it's
a
15
and
47-minute-hour
period.
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
16,
but
now,
this
is
not
a
continuum
questioning
or
interrogation
or
anything
like
it.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
an
interrogation
after
they
were
first
arrested
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
after
he
first
arrested
and
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
actually
--
it's
a
fair
question,
are
you
asking
us
to
make
the
--
to
make
the
so-called
mallory
rule
a
constitutional
rule,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
actually,
you
like
us
to,
but
i
wondered
if
we
don't
have
to
go
this
far
or
that
far
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
subject
of
your
supplemental
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
but
on
your
original
brief,
doesn't
it
boil
down
to
the
--
to
that
contention
that
the
mallory
rule
should
be
a
constitutional
rule,
a
due
process
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
wondered
what
additionally
there
was
here?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don't
--
could
you
just
say
in
a
word
or
two
what
in
addition
there
is
here
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
addition
to
--
at
the
top
of
the
contrary.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
the
mallory
rule
is
in
violation
of
a
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure.
justice
potter
stewart
requiring
prompt
arraignment?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
--
those
practices
which
you
described
aren't
quite
illustrated
by
this
case,
are
they?
they
knew
that
the
service
stations
had
been
held
up
but
as
soon
as
they
picked
this
man
up,
he
said,
“you've
got
me.”
then
he
came
in
and
he
orally
--
then
he
orally
confessed
to
lieutenant
wakeley
that
evening.
justice
potter
stewart
we
all
know
the
--
we've
all
read
about
the
practices
which
you're
describing
of
the
people
picked
up
on
open
charges
so-called
are
on
suspicion
and
then
released
without
charges.
this
is
that
case
and
this
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
they
did
know
a
service
station
has
been
robbed.
justice
potter
stewart
that
night
before
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
on
your
first
point,
you
have
to
rely
on
this
court's
overruling
at
least
two
authoritative
precedents.
justice
potter
stewart
what
time
did
that
happen?
what
time
of
the
day?
