justice
tom
c.
clark
by
the
owner
of
this
small
business
at

c.
clark
was

c.
clark
then
there
was
no
prohibition
--
if
there
is
a
rule
that
is
a
prohibition
against
the
cause
after
the
small

you,
there

no
such
prohibition
until

time
of

c.
clark
was
that
after
the
lineup
that

c.

(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
when

tom
c.
clark
well,
the
rest
of
the
custody
was
incommunicado,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
was
in
order
to
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
to
write
up
the
confession,
is
that
your
theory?
justice
tom
c.
clark
he
had
--
he
had
oral
statements
to
two
separate
officers.
justice
tom
c.
clark
he
just
--
the

the
brother.

tom
c.
clark
the
next
day?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
is
this
small
book
in
the
nature
of
a
booking
for
investigation
purposes?
justice
tom
c.
clark
could
it
be
possible
that
the
police
were
trying
to
tie
in
the
brother
who
had
not
confessed
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
when
they
booked
him
on

justice
tom
c.
clark

i
do
know
what
the
--
attorney
does
come
to
see
an
individual
being
held,
that
is
a
driving
privilege.
