mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
ever
sign
those
later
confessions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
they
ever
introduced
or
the
substance
of
it
introduced
in
the
court
against
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief

raymond
l.
haynes,
petitioner,
versus
washington.
mr.
kain.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
--
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you.
but
the
--
was
there
anything
in
the
record
as
to
whether
during
that
conversation
that
you
just
related,
he
asked
to
see
either
his
wife
or
an
attorney
or
to
communicate
with
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
he
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
the
confession
is
testified
too
by
the
officers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
officers
have
already
testified
that
he
wouldn't
be
booked
until
he
did
make
a
statement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
they
testify
to
in
that
regard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
categorically
denied
by
the
officers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
newspaper?
read
the
newspapers,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
did
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
he
claim
--
didn't
he
claim
here
that
for
some
days
after
the
confession
he
was
denied
the
opportunity
to
see
either
his
wife
or
a
lawyer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
--
is
there
contradiction
of
that
in
the
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
didn't
ask
that.
i
said
he
--
he
claims
that
he
was
held
incommunicado.
he
denied
the
opportunity
to
talk
to
anyone
for
days
after
the
confession.
now,
was
that
contradicted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
i
suppose
for
what
it's
worth,
we'd
have
to
take
it
as
true.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
its
worth,
they
say,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
isn't
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
only
reason
i
asked
that
question
was
because
you
said
two
other
witnesses
partially
identified
him.
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
since
that
--
since
you've
stated
--
said
that,
you
have
said
that
they
did
positively
identified
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
small
book?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
that
if
the
police
arrest
a
man
a
few
moments
after
a
robbery
and
he
is
identified
by
the
people
whom
he
robbed
and
he
confesses
to
the
robbery,
that
he
--
he
isn't
arrested,
in
the
normal
sense
of
the
word
and
--
and
then
subject
to
all
of
equal
processes
that
are
either
available
to
or
against
him
as
an
arrested
man.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
this
day
exists,
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
submit
that
that
--
that's
the
only
reason
this
man
was
not
put
on
a
regular
book
before
he
was
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
here
in
this
case
that
happened
late
at
night
and
the
police
and
everybody
went
home
and
went
to
bed,
and
got
up
in
the
morning
and
--
in
the
morning,
they
didn't
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
went
after
him
again.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
didn't
--
then
didn't
book
him
until
--
until
he
had
made
this
written
confession,
had
signed
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
that
doesn't
quite
bear
out,
does
it?
the
conclusion
that
the
only
reason
they
don't
charge
him
immediately
is
because
they
want
to
have
him
advise
of
his
rights.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who?
raymond
or
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
brother.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
the
brother
convicted
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
--
a
lawyer
couldn't
have
seen
him
during
the
time
he's
on
this
small
book,
could
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
the
lieutenant
testified
that
he
could
not,
am
i
--
you
know
the
record
better
than
i
do.
if
he
didn't
--
if
he
didn't
say
that
why
--
we
got
it
--
those
--
the
rest
of
your
argument
but
i
thought
the
lieutenant
said
that
--
i
think
the
--
one
of
these
questions
asked
of
lieutenant
wakeley,
“when
was
he
booked?
“he
wasn't
booked.
he
was
booked
for
investigation.
that
is
an
open
charge
after
the
people
picked
him
out
of
the
lineup.”
“this
book
for
investigation
is
what
you
call
a
small
book
down
there.”
answer:
“that
is
right.”
question:
“and
when
a
person
is
booked
for
investigation,
are
they
allowed
to
make
any
telephone
calls,
whatsoever?”
answer:
“no.”
“are
they
allowed
to
have
any
contact
with
the
outside
world?”
answer:
“no,
we
don't
allow
them
to
use
the
phone
to
call
out,
if
some
relative
wants
to
contact
the
lawyer
that
is
their
privilege.”
question:
“that
is
assuming
the
relative
knew
that
the
party
was
in
custody.”
“that
is
right.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
--
that
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
also
say
--
first
call
--
ask
for
an
attorney?asked
if
he
could
phone
an
attorney?i
thought
he
first
asked
--
said
he
asked
for
--
in
contact
with
an
attorney
and
then
later
he
just
asked
for
his
wife
and
he
testified
that
after
awhile
he
thought
it
over
and
concluded
that
he
didn't
want
his
wife
perhaps
to
get
a
lawyer
or
him
get
another
one
and
then
have
two
lawyers
settled
on
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
what
i
thought.

justice
earl
warren

speiser.
