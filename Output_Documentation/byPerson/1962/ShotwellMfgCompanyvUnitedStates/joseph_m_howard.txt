mr.
joseph
m.
howard
the
court
please,
i
will
handle
the
second,
third,
fourth
and
fifth
questions
in
the
briefs
and
mr.
oberdorfer
will
take
the
first
question,
the
question
of
the
suppression
of
evidence
of
the
voluntary
disclosure.
the
jury
found
these
defendants
guilty
after
six
weeks
trial
with
very
lengthy
evidence
about
3,000
pages
of
the
transcript
printed.
judge
nordbye
found
that
the
voluntary
disclosure,
the
alleged
voluntary
disclosure
was
false.
he
found
that
after
two
lengthy
hearings,
one
before
the
trial
and
the
other
one
after
this
court
had
remanded
the
case.
he
found
that
the
unrecorded
receipts
which
had
been
disclosed
by
the
voluntary
disclosure
had
not
been
spent
for
raw
materials
as
had
been
claimed
in
the
alleged
voluntary
disclosure.
judge
nordbye
also
found
that
there
was
an
attempt
to
fix
this
case
by
some
sort
of
mechanisms
within
the
revenue
service.
i
like
to
give
just
a
brief
summary
of
the
facts
to
support
those
two
findings
of
the
jury
and
of
the
--
of
judge
nordbye.
at
the
trial,
the
evidence
showed
that
corporation
through
its
officers
had
received
$400,000
in
black
market
receipts
during
the
years
1945
and
1946.
and
that
those
receipts
had
not
been
reported
on
the
returns.
there's
plenty
of
evidence
of
this,
direct
evidence
not
only
from
lubben
of
his
payments
but
also
from
others
who
had
made
payments
for
lubben.
and
there
was
a
wealth
of
documentary
evidence
to
support
that
to
corroborate
the
testimony
that
lubben
gave
as
to
this
approximately
$400,000
in
payments.
the
defense
was
that
the
taxpayers
had
received
that
is
that
the
corporation
had
received
only
$150,000
and
the
defense
further
claimed
and
put
on
evidence
to
support
it
that
they
had
spent
all
of
that.
the
evidence
was
not
different.
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
specific
payment
at
all
it
was
very
general.
the
issues
that
went
to
the
jury
then
were
how
much
did
the
corporation
get
in
the
first
place.
did
it
get
$400,000
or
did
it
get
$150,000?
and
the
second
issue
was
where
did
it
go?
did
it
go
in
payments
for
raw
material
as
the
defendants
claim
or
did
it
go
someplace
else?
there
was
a
sharp
conflict
in
the
evidence
on
this,
the
evidence
on
both
sides.
it
was
purely
a
question
of
credibility
which
group
of
witnesses
was
the
jury
going
to
believe
or
the
jury
believed
the
government's
witnesses
and
convicted
the
defendants.
on
the
voluntary
disclosure,
the
evidence
at
those
hearings
showed
that
sometime
early
in
1948,
the
defendants
began
worrying
about
these
1945
and
1946
returns.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
the
jury
was
allowed
to
consider
everything
that
came
before
them
as
to
the
voluntary
disclosure
and
there
was
a
great
deal.
they
were
instructed
that
they
could
consider
that
as
to
the
intent
of
the
defendants
whether
or
not
they
had
acted
in
good
faith.
the
instruction
was
given
at
the
requests
of
the
defense
and
in
substantial,
almost,
well,
it
was
very
substantially
as
requested
by
the
defense
and
there
was
no
objection.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
criminal
intent,
that's
right.
they
began
to
worry
about
this
early
in
1948
and
the
reason
for
that
was
that
lubben
was
beginning
to
have
tax
troubles
himself.
lubben's
tax
troubles
dated
back
as
far
as
1945
or
certainly
in
february
1946
when
he
filed
his
income
tax
return
and
included
only
a
partial
payment
and
gave
certain
reasons
why
he
had
not
paid
the
full
thing.
the
treasury
began
to
investigate
him
at
that
time.
and
as
judge
nordbye
found
in
his
opinion,
shotwell,
people
knew
that
when
lubben
began
having
tax
troubles,
their
day
of
reckoning
was
not
far
away.
consequently,
some
time
before
june
21,
1946
--
1948
busby
and
cain
went
in
to
see
mr.
sauber
who
was
at
that
time
a
high
official
in
the
chicago
office
of
the
revenue
service
and
this
is
judge
nordbye's
finding
on
the
--
after
the
supplemental
hearing.
sauber
told
them
to
make
a
complete
computation
of
the
receipts
and
the
disbursements.
now,
the
other
side
has
challenged
our
statement
that
he
wanted
--
that
sauber
told
them
to
make
a
computation
of
both
receipts
and
expenditures.
but
that
is
the
testimony
of
sauber
at
the
original
suppression
hearing.
it's
the
testimony
of
busby
at
the
trial
and
it's
the
testimony
of
graflund
who
quotes
cain
at
length
and
saying
that
this
is
what
sauber
told
them
to
do.
the
testimony
of
graflund
at
the
suppression
hearing
or
at
the
supplemental
hearing
after
the
case
went
back.
on
june
the
21st,
agent
sam
krane
arrived
on
an
errand
asking
for
records
of
the
corporations
dealings
with
lubben.
there
was,
as
the
record
shows,
immediate
consternation.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
uncertain.
judge
nordbye
finds
that
the
conversation
with
sauber
was
not
in
january
as
busby
and
cain
testified.
it
was
not
in
march
as
sauber
testified.
it
was
some
time
later
and
that
the
march
date
was
in
arbitrarily
hooked
up
date
between
busby,
cain
and
sauber.
that's
his
finding.
he
says
he
cannot
pin
it
down
exactly
but
it
was
sometime
before
june
21
when
agent
krane
came
in.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
right.
judge
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
right
sir.
he
made
his
finding
--
we're
not
concerned
with
that.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no
sir,
no
sir.
when
the
case
was
here
before,
we
thought
we
had
proof
that
it
had
not
occurred
at
that
time.
all
of
that
proof
was
put
before
him
and
he
made
his
finding.
after
--
immediately
after
krane's
visit
on
june
the
21st,
there
were
a
number
of
frantic
conferences
among
the
defendants
as
to
what
should
be
done.
and
at
that
time
as
judge
nordbye
found,
they
first
began
to
exert
themselves
to
collect
the
figures
on
the
attempted
voluntary
disclosure.
very
shortly
after
also,
cain
with
a
new
york
attorney
by
the
name
of
grace
at
a
meeting
with
lubben
and
his
attorney
whose
name
was
davidson
in
a
night
club
outside
of
new
york,
the
riviera
club.
and
cain
told
lubben
and
davidson
that
he
was
attempting
to
settle
a
case
by
political
contacts
and
he
mentioned
a
member
of
the
cabinet.
and
i
might
say
that
the
investigation
that
has
been
made
as
shown
no
connection
of
that
member
of
the
cabinet
with
this
case
whatsoever.
there's
other
evidence
in
the
record
that
cain
was
a
notorious
name-dropper
and
that
he
was
likely
to
say
that
he
had
gone
all
the
way
to
the
top.
so
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
although
that
name
is
in
there,
nothing
has
been
shown
to
connect
him
with
in
any
way
at
all.
at
any
rate,
cain
said,
he
was
trying
to
settle
it
in
this
manner
and
he
urged
lubben
to
go
to
south
america
and
stay
there
for
two
years
to
keep
out
of
the
way.
grace
said
that
he
was
going
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
office
of
dan
bolich
who
was
the
internal
revenue
agent
in
charge
in
new
york.
he
was
in
charge
of
the
fraud
cases.
and
this
court
knows
of
mr.
bolich
through
the
grunewald
case
where
he
appears
very
prominently
and
in
fact,
he
was
a
defendant.
after
the
meetings
in
new
york,
cain
called
the
various
interested
members
or
officers
of
the
corporation
together
in
the
belden-stratford
hotel
in
chicago
in
order
to
work
out
the
figures
which
were
to
be
submitted
to
the
revenue.
those
figures
showed
receipts
of
$400,000
and
they
also
showed
expenditures
of
$400,000.
i'm
using
it
in
a
very
approximate
term.
cain
admitted
that
those
expenditure
figures
were
merely
plug
figures
and
there
is
considerable
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
officers
of
the
corporation
tried
to
work
out
the
expenditures
and
the
most
they
could
come
to
is
about
$125,000
or
$150,000.
and
cain
said,
“sauber
told
us
we
had
to
have
this
in
here
and
we've
got
to
make
the
figures
matched”.
he
said,
“give
me
a
piece
of
paper
and
i'll
work
it
out.”
and
in
about
two
minutes,
he
scribbled
down
the
figures
which
we
have
at
the
bottom
of
this
exhibit
to
show
the
so-called
expenditures.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no
sir.
the
record
simply
shows
that
cain
said
or
i
mean
sauber
said,
“prepare
the
figures
on
the
receipts
and
on
the
disbursements
and
i
will
then
send
an
agent.
i
will
see
to
it
that
an
agent
comes
out
to
make
an
audit
to
determine
how
much
you
actually
owe”.
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
sauber
himself
did
not
testify
to
that,
no
sir.
at
a
later
date,
other
officials
in
the
revenue
said
that
they
would
refuse
to
close
the
date
or
close
the
case
until
they
found
out
where
that
actually
went
until
they
got
the
proof.
after
the
figures
had
been
completed,
agent
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no,
not
exactly,
no
sir.
i'm
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
it
comes
pretty
close
to
it.
that
was
the
figure
at
the
trial,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well,
i
think
that's
--
the
total
of
the
trial,
the
total
proof
there
was
about
$450,000.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
right.
and
the
total
on
the
sheets
is
slightly
different,
so
i
was
using
$400,000
just
as
an
approximate
figure.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
he
says
that
it
may
have
been
very
probably
exaggerated,
yes
sir.
he
doesn't
give
any
details
because
he
says
in
the
amount
that
we're
--
it
is
something
that
we're
not
concerned
with
on
this
particular
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well,
he
doesn't
say
that.
he
just
says
that
it
may
very
well
have
been
exaggerated.
after
this,
agent
lima
came
to
the
plant
and
talked
to
busby
and
was
handed
just
the
top
sheet,
just
the
summary.
he
wasn't
given
the
entire
set
of
papers.
he
was
told
by
lima
that
he
could
have
all
of
the
papers
if
he
could
come
to
an
agreement
that
the
figures
on
this
summary
were
acceptable
to
the
revenue.
so
lima
went
back
to
his
office
and
he
prepared
a
draft
of
reports
at
the
instructions
of
johnson
who
was
his
superior.
and
in
that
report,
he
allowed
deductions
for
all
of
these
unclaimed
expenditures,
unreported
expenditures
which
under
the
policy
of
the
department
at
that
time
were
not
being
allowed.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that
was
--
ultimately,
it
was
held
that
they
should
have
been
allowed.
the
first
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
came
after
this
episode,
that's
right.
first
decision
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
to
that?
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
at
that
point,
there
had
not
been,
no
sir.
it
was
in
dispute
and
ultimately,
the
first
decision
was
the
sullenger
decision
in
the
tax
court
which
is
cited
in
our
case
and
that
was
followed
up
by
three
or
four
circuit
court
cases.
and
finally,
just
before
the
trial,
the
commissioner
acquiesced
in
and
of
itself.
he
allowed
all
of
these
claimed
expenditures
although
he
had
been
presented
with
no
substantiation
for
them
whatsoever.
and
it's
been
admitted
all
along
they
can't
be
substantiated.
and
he
came
up
on
the
draft
of
his
report
with
a
$20,000
deficiency.
shortly
after
this,
cain
told
huebner
and
graflund
that
he
had
settled
the
case
for
$20,000
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
1945
and
1946,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
those
are
the
allowed
expenditures,
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well,
he
allowed
--
he
disallowed
those
i
think.
those
that
you've
got
there
are
those
that
he
disallowed.
he
said,
he
would
not
allow
them.
what
he
allowed
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
oh,
i'm
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes,
that's
right,
that's
right.
he
was
proposing
to
allow
almost
all
of
those
expenditures.
all
of
the
claimed
expenditures
for
raw
materials
he
was
allowed.
there
were
a
few
others
in
there
that
he
disallowed,
exactly
why
it's
never
been
explained
but
they
were
a
very
minor
amount
of
the
claimed
expenditures.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
right,
right
sir,
that's
right.
cain
told
graflund
and
huebner
that
he
could
settle
it
for
$20,000,
and
shortly
after
that,
he
asked
huebner
for
$10,000
to
take
care
of
the
fix
of
the
case.
well,
this
was
in
the
late
summer
of
1948
and
about
this
time,
somebody
in
the
revenue
service
apparently
got
suspicious
of
the
case
and
a
fraud
investigation
was
began,
and
thereupon
followed
the
destruction
of
quite
a
number
of
records.
lima's
draft
of
a
report
was
destroyed
within
the
revenue
service
on
the
instructions
of
his
superior,
johnson
who
is
by
the
way
a
defendant
in
the
other
case
which
is
pending
in
chicago
at
the
present
time.
cain
directed
that
graflund
destroy
a
record
which
mrs.
merrill
had
kept
of
the
so-called
corn
box.
money
was
coming
into
the
corn
box
and
being
paid
out
for
the
raw
materials
according
to
the
general
testimony
at
the
trial.
the
record
had
been
kept
to
that
and
cain
ordered
it
destroyed.
graflund
had
kept
a
record
of
money
which
was
transferred
from
that
corn
box
to
a
safety
deposit
box
in
the
bank.
this
was
all
the
black
market
receipts.
cain
destroy
--
or
cain
directed
him
to
destroy
that
record.
finally,
sometime
later,
when
the
revenue
agents
were
already
working
in
the
plant,
revenue
agent
mammel,
whose
name
was
mentioned
throughout
the
record,
discovered
that
there
had
been
some
studies
of
inventory.
and
he
asked
for
those
and
cain
at
that
point
directed
that
they'd
be
destroyed
and
they
were.
graflund
went
down
to
the
plant
on
a
saturday
afternoon
and
destroyed
them
also.
as
to
the
second
point
which
is
the
charge
that
we
submitted
false
affidavits
to
this
court
when
the
case
was
here
before.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes
sir.
it
could.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
could
they?
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
right,
right,
it
was
another
offense,
separate
offense.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
right,
right
but
of
course
that
occurred
to
us
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings
but
we
saw
no
reason
to
begin
a
new
prosecution
when
we
have
this
one
in
the
stage
that
it
was.
as
to
the
contention
that
we
submitted
false
affidavits
to
this
court
and
that
we
withheld
evidence
from
the
court
when
the
case
was
here
before,
so
far
as
the
false
affidavits
are
concerned,
they
are
the
affidavits
of
mr.
yaden,
mr.
russo,
mr.
huebner
and
mr.
graflund.
all
of
which
were
submitted
to
the
court
at
one
time
or
another
in
support
of
the
motion
to
remand.
when
the
case
went
back
before
judge
nordbye,
all
of
the
witnesses
testified
as
we
said
they
would.
there
wasn't
any
material
variance.
there
were
some
things
that
they
did
not
testify
to.
but
as
to
the
statements
that
we
made
to
the
court
as
to
what
witnesses
would
testify,
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
record
that
they
did
testify
as
we
said
they
were
going
to.
and
judge
nordbye
heard
those
witnesses
and
saw
them
on
the
stand.
and
he
has
found
that
nothing
that
was
submitted
in
the
affidavits
to
this
court
was
false.
he
found
that
there
was
one
mistake
in
the
statement
of
graflund
that
he
had
not
told
busby
about
the
black
market
dealings
in
january.
as
to
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes
sir,
it
was.
that's
right.
it
was
crucial
to
our
argument
on
the
timeliness
part
of
it.
and
as
to
that,
he
found
that
busby
had
made
a
mistake.
he
also
found
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
i'm
sorry,
graflund,
yes
sir.
that
graflund
had
made
a
mistake.
he
also
found
specifically
that
he
had
done
it
honestly.
and
he
says
in
at
least
two
points
in
his
opinion
that
he
was
satisfied
that
graflund
was
trying
to
tell
the
truth.
he
may
have
been
mixed
up
on
that
one
point
where
he
was
trying
to
tell
the
truth.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
the
only
thing
that
--
so
far
as
i
know
your
honor,
when
we
filed
a
brief
here
before,
we
included
in
it
a
summary
of
what
our
witnesses
would
testify
to
when
the
case
got
back
before
judge
nordbye.
so
far
as
i
know,
that's
the
only
thing
in
which
he
has
found
that
we
were
mistaken.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes
sir.
that
was
part
of
it.
there
were
two
parts
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
we
have
the
testimony
of
a
man
as
i
recall
it
now
of
a
man
name
irvin
who
was
going
to
testify
about
a
meeting
that
he
had
have
with
the
defendants
and
that
was
the
basis
of
--
a
part
of
our
position
when
we
were
here
before
on
the
timeliness.
now,
irvin
had
a
stroke
before
the
trial
--
before
the
rehearing
and
in
fact
died
a
short
time
later,
so
he
was
not
available
to
us.
later
on,
after
we
had
filed
those
claims,
graflund
did
change
the
testimony
that
he
had
given
to
us
earlier.
after
the
--
i'll
use
the
word
“refresher
courses”
that
we
had
given
the
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
i'm
not
sure.
yes,
he
did,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
it
was
in
graflund's
affidavit.
not
the
change,
no,
the
fact
that
the
testimony
that
he
had
not
talked
to
busby
about
this
in
january
was
in
his
affidavit.
we
said
nothing
about
the
change.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
right.
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
right.
before
the
remand,
he
said
that
but
he
had
at
that
time
talked
to
busby
and
in
--
no.
he
was
saying
that
he
had
not
talked
to
busby
at
the
time
the
case
was
here
before
until
june,
until
some
time
after
sam
krane
had
appeared
in
the
court.
and
that's
the
posture
in
which
the
case
was
in
at
the
time
it
came
before
you
in
the
court.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
it
was
before
the
remand
because
that
was
the
effect
of
his
affidavit.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
found
against
his
story.
that's
right,
that's
right,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
because
your
honor,
this
was
a
question
of
credibility
of
the
witnesses
and
we
after
a
long
thorough
investigation
of
all
of
these
witnesses,
had
concluded
that
the
story
that
was
being
told
to
us
at
that
time
was
the
true
story.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
and
the
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
oh
no,
he
hadn't
repudiated
his
affidavit.
he
had
repudiated
his
earlier
story.
the
story
he
--
what
he
had
said
in
the
first
place
was
that
he
had
talked
to
busby
in
january.
and
then
he
--
certain
things
were
brought
to
his
attention
and
he
changed
his
testimony.
he
said,
“i
didn't
talk
to
him
until
sam
krane
had
appeared
at
the
plant.”
that
was
what
was
put
into
the
affidavit
that
was
submitted
to
this
court.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
what
he
testified
to
before
judge
nordbye,
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
judge
nordbye
found
that
he
was
mistaken
but
that
he
is
honestly
mistaken.
and
our
reason
for
not
submitting
the
contradictory
statements
to
this
court
was
that
we
believe
that
the
story
of
the
witnesses
were
telling
us
at
that
time
was
a
true
story
and
we
have
examined
it
over
a
period
of
about
18
months
and
checked
it
in
every
way
we
possibly
could
and
we
felt
that
it
was
a
question
of
credibility.
and
this
court
does
not
usually
pass
on
questions
of
credibility
if
this
had
been
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well,
we
were
saying,
this
is
what
the
witnesses
will
testify
to
at
this
time
and
we
submit,
i
think
this
is
the
language
that
we
used
in
our
motion
to
remand
that
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
are
not
equipped
to
decide
issues
of
credibility.
and
for
that
reason,
we
ask
that
it'd
be
sent
back
so
that
those
questions
of
credibility
could
be
decided
back
there.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no
sir.
no,
if
he
had
change
prior
to
that
time.
the
affidavit
that
we
presented
to
this
court
was
what
he
testified
to
at
the
remand.
he
had
given
us
a
much
earlier
statements
here
that
this
investigation
went
long
for
18
months
and
when
these
people
were
first
called
in
to
be
questioned,
they
had
--
this
was
a
matter
that
had
happened
10
or
12
years
before.
and
the
first
time
they
were
called
in,
they
were
encouraged
to
give
anything
that
they
recalled
about
the
thing.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no,
he
had
change
before
that.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no.
we
didn't
say
it
was
wrong,
we
said
that
what
he
would
testify
to
that
is
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no.
no,
he's
stuck
to
that
thereafter.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
right.
he
changed
only
once
and
he
is
stand
to
that
story
afterward.
judge
nordbye
found
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no
sir.
he
found
that
he
was
mistaken.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
right,
that's
right.
he
found
that
he
was
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that
was
all
in
the
record.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
sure.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
not
for
the
jury,
no
sir.of
course,
all
of
this
was
--
i
can't
see
that
that
would
have
made
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no,
no
sir.
the
contention
that
we
had
made
at
the
first
hearing
was
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that
question
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no,
that
question
didn't
come
up.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
right,
not
when
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
january.
the
sauber
did
not
testify
at
the
trial.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no
sir.
cain
and
busby
testified
at
the
trial
and
they
said
it
happened
in
january.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no
sir.
not
at
that
time
at
all.
we
were
not
concerned
with
that
point
at
the
trial.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
it
came
to
our
attention
much
later,
that's
right,
when
after
the
petition
for
certiorari
had
been
filed.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
right.
he
did
not
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
he
did
not
make
any
finding
as
to
timeliness
at
all.
there
had
been
an
argument
about
it.
we
were
saying
that
the
case
had
been
assigned
to
an
agent
back
in
december
but
he
said,
it's
not
necessary
for
me
to
make
any
finding
on
that
at
all
because
i
find
that
it's
entirely
lacking
in
good
faith.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
this
is
judge
nordbye's?
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
oh!
oh
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that
was
the
affidavit
that
he
had
submitted.
we
had
other
statements.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
we
had
earlier
statements
that
busby
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no
sir.
no,
he
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no,
he
didn't
say
anything
about
it
there
at
all.
we
did
have
such
statements
which
he
had
given
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
you
said
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no.
no,
no.
no
sir.
what
we
had
were
the
earlier
statements
that
graflund
had
given
which
were
the
other
way.
that
is
that
he
had
talked
to
busby
on
the
train
and
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no
sir,
he
didn't
change
it.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no,
no,
they
didn't
know.
this
court
did
not
know
anything
about
the
earlier
statements
because
we
told
this
court
what
we
thought
busby
would
testify
to
when
the
case
went
back.
what
we
thought
was
the
truth,
busby
had
given
his
earlier
statements
and
we
have
gone
over
those
and
over
those
and
pointed
out
to
him
various
things.
and
finally,
something
that
was
said,
some
incident
stirred
his
mind
and
he
finally
decided
that
he
must
have
been
wrong
about
the
january
conference
with
busby
on
the
train
and
decided
that
it
could
not
have
been
until
june.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no
sir,
no
sir.
because
our
feeling
never
even
--
i
handled
a
good
bit
of
this
and
it
never
even
crossed
my
mind
that
we
should
submit
to
this
court
all
of
the
various
statements
that
we
have.
some
of
which
were
different
from
those
which
we
were
telling
the
court,
the
witnesses
were
going
to
testify
to.
i
don't
know
how
we
could
have
done
it.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
no
sir,
we
wanted
you
to
send
it
--
we
wanted
you
to
send
it
back
to
judge
nordbye,
so
that
he
could
determine
who
was
telling
the
truth
about
this.
we
didn't
want
to
--
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
well,
your
honor,
we
vouched
for
his
testimony
as
of
that
moment.
that
is
that
this
is
what
he
would
say
and
that's
what
judge
--
well,
i'm
sorry
on
this
one.
on
this
particular
one,
judge
nordbye
found
that
he
was
mistaken.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
he
did
say
it
to
judge
nordbye,
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
m.
howard
that's
correct.
but
honestly,
he
emphasizes
that
but
he
thought
that
graflund
was
mistaken
but
that
he
had
made
an
honest
mistake.
