mr.
george
b.
christensen
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
tragic
tale
that's
unfolded
by
this
record
is
i
think
one
that
with
tax
your
credulity
where
we
not
able
to
document
it,
so
well
as
we
assert
we
have
documented
it.
and
once
it's
understood
it's
a
--
not
only
tragic
but
it's
a
dark
and
frightening
tale
but
for
two
things,
those
two
things
are
first,
your
decision
in
the
jencks
case
in
1957
that
gave
us
the
tools
to
work
with
at
least
to
start
the
investigation
by
the
production
of
witness
statements
and
that
ultimately
led
to
grand
jury
testimony
that
disclosed
how
this
record
at
least
upon
the
remanded
proceeding
had
been
put
together.
and
that
in
turn
led
us
to
the
evidence
of
the
perjury
that
had
been
offered
against
the
citizens
we
represent
upon
their
original
jury
trial.
and
of
course
the
second
thing
that
relieves
the
tragedy
of
this
case
that
we
assert
brings
a
blush
of
shame
to
american
jurisprudence
is
the
right
to
apply
here
for
certiorari
and
fortunately
to
have
obtained
it.
now,
the
case
is
complicated.
i
fear
that
you
are
going
to
have
the
greatest
of
difficulty
in
following
the
facts.
basic
to
an
understanding
of
it,
i
think
is
this,
this
was
a
criminal
indictment
or
evasion
of
a
portion
of
the
income
taxes
of
the
shotwell
manufacturing
corporation,
a
corporation,
for
the
years
1945
and
1946
indictment
alleged
some
$500,000
of
gross
income
or
of
net
income
was
unreported
and
that
the
resulting
tax
by
the
time
of
trial,
they
claim
they
had
there
shown
time
of
trial
not
$500,000
but
approximately
$454,000.
now
that
mind
you
is
the
year
1953
when
the
trial
took
place.
now,
there's
a
greatest
difference
between
that
figure
and
something
that
had
occurred
years
before
and
which
was
in
large
part,
subject
to
justice
harlan's
opinion
when
we
were
here
the
first
time.
bearing
in
mind
that
this
alleged
evasion
is
assumed
to
have
occurred
in
1945
and
1946
and
that
the
prosecutors
delayed
until
the
last
day
before
the
statute
ran
in
1952
before
pitching
in
an
indictment.
the
fact
is
that
in
early
1948
when
the
treasury
so-called
“voluntary
disclosure
program”
was
in
effect.
these
petitioners
went
to
ernie
sauber
then
assistant
deputy
collector
in
chicago
and
made
a
voluntary
disclosure.
now,
mind
you,
here
is
where
mentally
you
have
to
shift
gears
and
you
get
in
to
some
of
the
confusion
in
which
this
entire
case
evolves.
the
shotwell
company
made
candy.
it
made
a
variety
of
candy
that
instead
of
using
corn
--
instead
of
using
cane
sugar,
used
corn
syrup
as
its
principal
sweetener.
and
in
the
year
1945,
after
the
v-e
day,
the
fact
was,
and
there
is
no
dispute
about
this,
that
the
office
price
administration's
price
ceilings
upon
corn,
raw
corn,
corn
in
the
bin
in
the
hands
of
the
farmer,
became
totally
out
of
balance
with
respect
to
the
price
on
hogs.
and
it
was
of
course
far
more
profitable
then
for
a
farmer
instead
of
selling
his
corn
to
feed
it
and
sell
his
hogs
and
there
came
a
time
in
the
late
fall
of
1945
and
i
speak
from
the
record
that
any
time
i
depart
from
the
record,
i
will
tell
you
so.
when
cash
corn
virtually
disappeared
from
the
greatest
corn
market
in
the
world,
the
chicago
board
of
trade,
the
commodity
credit
corporation
either
in
late
1945
or
early
1946,
i
forget
which
itself
went
out
on
the
so-called
black
or
gray
market
and
began
paying
anywhere
from
25
cents
to
50
cents
a
bushel
upward
for
corn.
well,
what
went
on,
i
don't
but
obviously,
the
war
was
over,
the
period
of
price
controls
was
about
over.
they
were
not
adjusted
until
some
time
in
about
june
30th,
1946.
that
is
near
enough
when
the
ceiling
upon
corn
was
removed,
it
became
plentiful
and
after
that,
there
became
plenty
of
corn
syrup
and
on
we
went
in
our
way.
now,
during
that
time,
it
is
our
contention
that
to
get
cash,
it
did
not
show
upon
shotwell's
books
so
that
we
wouldn't
be
caught
by
the
opa
inspectors.
we
sold
some
candy.
a
character
by
the
name
of
lubben
whom
you've
met
before,
not
merely
in
your
first
go-around
with
this
case
but
in
the
long
and
giglio
cases
arising
out
of
new
york.
we
sold
candy
to
him
in
which
he
paid
in
addition
to
the
ceiling
invoice
price
of
the
candy,
a
premium
per
pound.
a
great
dispute
as
to
what
the
amount
of
that
premium
was.
we
then
took
that
cash,
didn't
record
it,
said
nothing
about
it
and
we
used
that
in
turn
to
pay
elevator
operators
or
so-called
“bird
dogs”,
you
would
pay
them
the
premium
price
upon
corn
and
they
would
sell
and
then
make
corn
available
to
corn
products
refining,
hubinger,
penick
and
ford,
whoever
the
corn
refiner
was.
they
grind
the
corn
and
they
in
turn
would
sell
you
corn
syrup
at
ceiling.
now,
this
has
all
been
done
secretly.
as
the
fellow
lubben
fell
into
the
greatest
of
difficulties
as
he
well
could
with
the
characters
he
was
associated
with
that
reflected
by
your
record
in
united
states
versus
long
and
giglio
and
justice
brennan
knows
that
experience
with
mr.
lubben
in
new
jersey
that
led
to
a
disbarment
there
and
a
rectification
of
a
distillery
swindle
he
got
into
later
on.
he
wanted
a
loan
and
my
corporate
client
sends
its
outside
auditor.
he
used
to
take
a
look
at
lubben's
books
and
to
see
what
shape
he
was
in.
should
we
loan
him
some
money?
he'd
go
into
the
candy
business.
this
auditor,
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
busby,
an
auditor,
a
public
accountant
of
unquestioned
integrity,
went
out
there
and
he
came
back
and
he
saw
our
clients
harold
sullivan
and
byron
cain
and
he
said
he's
in
hopeless
shape,
don't
loan
in
any
money
and
what's
more?
his
books
would
indicate
that
he's
been
paying
you
some
over
ceiling
premiums
back
in
1945
and
1946.
and
you
never
told
me
anything
about
that.
i
made
your
tax
returns.
what
are
you
guys
been
up
to?
and
lubben
had
with
him
on
this
trip,
and
this
becomes
crucial,
shotwell's
own
comptroller
or
head
bookkeeper,
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
graflund.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
beg
your
pardon,
thank
you
sir.
busby
had
with
him
this
gentleman
by
the
name
of
graflund.
and
graflund
on
this
trip,
told
him
yes
and
as
he
put
it
in
testifying
to
united
states
grand
jury,
“i
didn't
spare
the
horses
in
telling
you.”
they
returned
to
chicago
on
the
11th
of
january
and
busby
goes
to
his
clients
and
says,
“what
are
you
been
up
to?”
so
you're
in
tax
difficulties
and
this
is
a
fine
kettle
of
fish
and
they
say
to
one
in
substance,
“look,
we
took
the
money
in.
we
spend
it
for
corn,
what's
the
tax
problem?”
he
said,
“the
tax
problem
is
this,
that
under
treasury
regulations,
what
you
acquire
or
receive
is
premium
payments,
is
gross
income
that
you
must
account
for.
what
you
may
have
spent
over
ceiling
for
raw
material
cannot
be
taken
as
part
of
the
cost
of
goods
or
any
other,
for
our
purposes,
let's
say,
deductible
item.
you
are
going
to
be
taxed
upon
the
gross
amount.”
he
then
told
them
about
the
voluntary
disclosure
program.
busby
is
not
a
lawyer
and
he
had
never
made
a
voluntary
disclosure
although
he
knew
about
it.
and
the
essence
of
the
voluntary
disclosure
program
and
you
will
find
at
the
back
end
of
both
our
petition
for
certiorari
in
our
main
brief,
the
official
statements
of
it.
it
never
came
out
in
a
regulation
but
pronouncements
from
the
secretary
of
treasury
as
the
general
counsel
of
the
treasury
and
they
were
in
substance,
you've
got
something
wrong
with
your
tax
return.
come
in
and
tell
us
about
it.
you'll
be
taxed,
you
may
get
civil
penalties
but
there
will
be
no
criminal
prosecution.
this
is
the
way
to
avoid
going
to
jail.
it
was
part
of
a
concerted
right
during
those
years
to
get
in
money,
tax
money,
resulting
from
precisely
transactions
of
this
kind.
it
was
feared
that
much
of
it
would
escape
taxation.
they
said,
busby
find
out
how
to
do
it.
busby
went
to
sauber,
he
talked
with
him
without
disclosing
the
name
of
his
client,
simply
finding
out
what
to
do
and
putting
it
up
as
a
hypothetical
case.
and
then
he
went
on
and
reported
to
his
clients,
“yes,
we
can
do
it,
it
will
be
all
right.
all
right,
go
in
and
disclose
and
tell
them
who
we
are.”
and
that
was
done.
now,
i'm
not
trying
to
be
precise
on
dates.
i
will
get
to
that
and
that
was
part
of
the
controversy
when
we
were
here
before.
they
said,
“we
don't
know
what
we
did
with
this
money.
we
can't
prove
it.
we
didn't
want
to
know
too
much
about
these
people,
it
was
dirty
business.”
and
the
deputy
collector
said,
“as
treasury
regulations
at
that
time
1948
required,
you
will
get
no
credit
for
a
dime
that
you
spend
over
ceiling
no
matter
how
you
documented
or
proved
it.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
you
know
what
you
did
with
this
money
or
who
you
paid
it
to
you
aren't
going
to
be
able
to
take
it
as
a
deduction
or
an
offset
or
as
a
part
of
your
cost
to
goods.
don't
bother
to
file
an
amended
return,
you
apparently
haven't
got
accurate
records,
assemble
such
information
as
you
can,
from
memory,
from
notes,
from
what
you
can
gather
here,
there
and
the
other
places,
an
agent
will
be
out
to
investigate
and
turn
it
over
to
him.”
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
i
am
--
the
deputy
collector's
words,
the
words
of
busby
who
testified
with
the
same
conversations
and
the
words
of
cain
upon
the
original
suppression
hearing
in
1952.
they're
all
to
the
same
general
effect,
mr.
justice.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
say
not.
no
contradictory
testimony.
the
government
claim
before
it
had
circumstances
inconsistent
with
that.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
january
to
march
of
1948.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
it
occurred
over
three
conversations,
possibly
four.
my
memory
isn't
sharp
enough
to
answer
that
any
more
accurately
than
that
mr.
justice.
he
first
went
in
and
put
it
hypothetically.
how
do
i
do
this?
what
do
i
do?
and
he
went
back
and
he
reported
to
cain
and
sullivan,
“this
is
what
you
can
do
and
it
will
probably
be
alright.”
they
said,
“alright.”
go
in
and
disclose.
he
went
in
and
ultimately
he
took
cain
who
was
the
president
of
the
company
and
the
two
of
them
talked.
now
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
cain
was
the
president
of
the
corporation.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
and
sullivan
was
the
general
counsel
and
treasurer
or
vice
president,
i
forgot
which.
and
they
or
their
families
were
the
principal
stockholders
of
the
shotwell
company.
now,
this
was
done
and
then
they
prepared.
i
don't
know
whether
you
have
before
you
the
petitions
for
certiorari
but
we're
talking
about
suppressing
of
documents
and
the
copies
of
these
documents
that
appear
in
the
photo
stacks
or
the
xerox
copies
at
the
back
end
of
the
petitioner
for
certiorari
are
the
most
legible
reproductions
of
it.
these
are
what
are
known
as
the
disclosure
documents,
this
with
some
others
but
this
is
illustrated.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
those
were
filed
in
august
of
1948
when
the
agent
came
out.
now,
they
told
him,
“we
don't
know
what
to
do”.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes,
i
am.
now
they
told
him,
“we
don't
know.
we
don't
have
any
records
and
we
know
this
fellow
lubben
is
going
to
claim
everything
and
of
course
they
knew
that
whatever
they
said
about
these
transactions
would
be
checked
by
the
treasury
with
whatever
lubben
claimed
and
we
know
we
had
trade
deals
with
this
fellow
in
which
he
would
go
out
and
locate
some
fellow
who
had
an
oversupply
of
chocolate
or
milk
or
whatever
it
may
be
and
we
trade
him
some
candy
at
ceiling
for
him
making
oral
goods.
we
will
disregard
all
of
that.
we
will
consider
that
on
every
town
the
candy
we
saw
lubben,
we
got
the
highest
possible
rate
of
overage
that
he
ascribes
to
it.
we
will
try
to
make
such
a
computation
and
when
we
come
up
with
that,
we'll
say,
that's
our
best
recollection
and
you
tax
us,
you
tax
us.”
so
they
prepared
these
things.
they
got
to
hold
to
some
of
lubben's
record
in
january
or
february.
they
found
lubben
who'd
gotten
in
difficulty,
had
some
of
his
records
in
the
hands
of
a
public
accountant,
(inaudible)
in
new
york.
they
got
his
things.
they
got
themselves
together
but
they
weren't
dragged,
didn't
go
on
all
the
time,
busby
who
was
in
charge
of
it,
went
away
on
vacation.
and
finally
along
in
june,
the
treasury
began
investigating
mr.
lubben
in
new
york.
new
york
treasury
agents
began
investigating
lubben.
and
so
new
york
said
to
its
brothers
in
chicago,
“go
out
and
see
what
shotwell's
record
show
about
lubben.”
that
was
on
the
21st
day
of
june
1948.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that
was
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
sam
krane
and
he
also
then,
at
a
subsequent
date,
he
came,
the
chief
agent
for
the
intelligence
section
who
investigated
our
case.
but
on
june
21,
1948,
sam
krane
was
simply
running
an
errand
for
his
counterparts
in
new
york
to
get
confirmatory
information
from
shotwell
for
the
use
of
the
new
york
agents
in
investigation.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
agent
lima
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that's
the
way
he
pronounced
it.
agent
lima
is
simply
an
ordinary
agent.
krane
is
in
the
so-called
detective
intelligence
section
they
worked
in
different
departments.
now,
they
prepared
these
things
then
cain
finally
said
to
his
people
“get
together”.
they
owned
an
interest
in
the
belden-stratford
hotel.
he
said,
“get
out
to
the
factory.
come
out
to
the
hotel.
let's
sit
down
and
everybody
get
together
and
get
this
over
with.
there's
going
to
be
an
agent
out
here
and
i
want
to
know
where
we
stand.”
in
the
meantime,
early
in
june
and
this
came
out
on
the
remanded
hearing
you
ordered.
harold
sullivan
had
been
in
a
hospital
and
there
was
another
fellow
from
the
treasury
and
he'd
known
for
quite
awhile
was
a
room
or
two
away
from
him.
and
on
the
4th
of
june,
harold
is
getting
early
to
leave
the
hospital
and
this
fellow
horrigan
had
just
come
in.
they
had
the
same
doctor
and
he
said,
“look,
i've
got
your
friend
horrigan
down
the
hall,”
and
harold
said,
“well,
i'll
go
down
and
say
goodbye
to
him
before
i
go.”
and
he
gets
in
there
and
he
loans
him
a
portable
radio
and
he
says,
“what's
the
trouble
with
this
fellow
sullivan?
why
doesn't
he
send
an
agent
out
to
investigate?”
and
horrigan
says,
“well,
i'll
jog
him
up.”
and
so
horrigan
calls
up
sullivan
and
says,
“what
are
you
doing?”
sullivan
is
in
here
complaining
to
me.
he
says,
“oh
well,
you
know
things
take
time.”
or
that
is
--
i
haven't
got
it
quite
right
but
that
is
substantially
it.
now,
in
any
event,
they
prepared
these
computations
and
you
will
see
if
you
examine,
they
start
out
sales
is
recorded
in
the
shotwell
records
and
down
there,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
every
transactions,
every
sale
ever
called
in
to
question
in
this
case.
and
down
there,
there
may
be
a
clerical
error
here
and
there
but
for
all
practical
purposes
on
there
is
every
scrap
of
information
of
our
books
digest.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
that
would
be
--
now,
if
i
may,
i'm
not
referring
on
each
one
of
the
sheets
mr.
justice
brennan.
if
i
may,
let
me
switch
over
before
i
answer
that
to
the
other
side
of
the
sheet.
and
you'll
see
that
as
headed
“memo
taken
from
lubben
record”.
now,
you'll
recall,
i
told
you
they
tried
to
find
out
what
lubben
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
i'm
looking
at
86
but
it's
the
same
on
87.
it's
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
and
they
took
the
way
that
lubben
appeared
to
reflect
on
such
records
as
he
had
his
counterpart
at
these
transactions.
now,
then
if
i
may
go
back
to
get
to
your
question,
you'll
see
under
memo
taken
from
lubben
record,
his
record,
and
you
compare
that
with
our
figure
on
the
first
line
of
the
page
i'm
looking
at
is
$2600
item.
lubben
showed
it
as
a
$6100
item.
and
then
we
show
he
added
some
$34,000.
now,
that
is
taken
--
that
difference
is
translated
into
pounds
and
that
furnishes
the
per-pound
figure
shown
on
shotwell
on
recorded
per-pound
upon
the
assumption
of
lubben's
claims,
you
would
add
that
much
per-pound.
now,
bearing
in
mind
and
it's
found
that
lubben's
testimony
was
exaggerated
on
the
new
hearing
you
ordered.
and
lubben
was
charging
off
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
certainly.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes
sir.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
added
from
lubben
records.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
those
were
--
see
this
is
in
1943
or
1944
whether
our
records
weren't
in
existence.
these
were
sales
he
showed
he'd
receive
from
us
that
didn't
--
weren't
reflected
on
our
records.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
$16,336.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
beg
your
pardon.
well,
judge,
that
is
--
that's
the
total
of
the
whole
page,
i
think.
no,
i
don't
know.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i'll
get
an
explanation
for
that.
i
can't
make
that
for
you
at
the
moment.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i'm
coming
to
that,
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
now,
accepting
our
thesis
for
a
moment
that
by
taking
his
figures
that
from
the
very
first
moment,
we
told
sullivan
and
everybody
were
wrong
but
we
said,
“we
want
this
immunity.
we
want
no
fight
with
this
man.
we
contest
his
figures.
we're
going
to
have
a
tax
hearing
or
some
kind
and
these
people
did
not
want
any
record
in
chicago.
they'd
been
in
the
black
market
even
to
this
extent.
we'll
take
whatever
he
said.”
and
by
--
to
that
extent
and
for
purposes
of
a
civil
settlement
in
gaining
immunity,
saying,
“we'll
take
lubben's
figures.
they
then
show
in
this
first
sheet
at
85
is
a
summary
or
a
recapitulation
of
the
big
sheets.
they
show
on
there
accounts
receivable
or
income
that
was
far
greater
than
the
truth.
now,
they
knew
they
weren't
going
to
get
any
credit
for
whatever
they'd
spend
out
and
they
couldn't
make
a
truthful
account
having
been
willing
to
confess
or
admit
or
say
for
this
purpose,
“alright,
we'll
take
his
figures”.
they
couldn't
make
an
accurate
account
of
disbursements.
if
you
pay
me
a
thousand
dollars
and
i
admit
i
got
$5,000,
i
can't
show
anybody
in
god's
world
from
now
to
the
end
of
eternity
how
i
spent
that
other
$4,000.
these
figures
were
never
filed
as
a
deduction,
as
an
amended
return
or
any
benefit
claim
on
them
whatsoever
as
you
read
judge
nordbye's
opinion,
you
will
find
that
it
is
the
bottom
half
of
this
so-called
cash
account
down
here
that
is
used
to
condemn
our
people.
those
figures
were
never
filed
with
the
government.
these
were
part
of
busby's
work
papers
turned
over
to
agent
lima
when
pursuant
to
the
disclosure
he
came
to
make
his
own
investigation.
my
people
went
ultimately
as
this
investigation
went
on
and
on
and
on
and
they
say,
“who
do
you
pay
this
black
market
money
to?
who
should
buy
it
for
and
from?”
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
first
time
they
were
wanting
us
to
turn
the
informer.
now,
when
we
confess
upon
shotwell
and
disclose
on
shotwell,
we
are
not
required
to
turn
informer
on
our
suppliers.
or
if
you
accept
judge
nordbye's
theory
which
we
thoroughly
contest,
that
some
of
this
money
found
its
way
into
the
personal
pockets
of
the
corporate
officers
for
which
they
have
never
been
indicted
or
at
a
jury
trial.
the
corporation
is
not
obliged
to
turn
informer
upon
those
corporate
officers.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes,
yes.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
all
in
cash.
lubben
would
pay
him
cash.
they'd
accumulate
cash.
there
was
a
dentist
the
board
of
trade
as
you
will
recall
is
in
an
office
building
downtown
where
they
got
a
lot
of
people
in
that
office,
there
was
a
dentist
doctor.
his
name
was
dr.
dowell
we
first
heard
about
it.
this
dentist
was
an
operator
in
this
field.
you
can
get
an
envelop
with
a
lot
of
bills
in
it
and
take
it
down
to
dr.
dowell
and
dr.
dowell
would
say
there's
going
to
be
northern
pacific
car
number
so
and
so,
burlington
car
so
and
so,
so
and
so
and
so
and
so.
they
will
show
up
a
week
from
now
at
corn
products
refining.
pays
a
ceiling
price,
corn
products
will
pay
the
ceiling
price
you
get.
that
was
that
kind
of
an
operation.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
if
i
said
it
an
unqualified
fact
and
i
did
not
mean
to.
yes,
they
were.
they
were
turned
over
to
agent
lima.
and
they
were
turned
over
to
the
intel
--
they
were
turned
over
to
agent
lima
approximately
the
1st
of
august
when
he
came
out
to
commence
his
investigation
and
when
the
intelligent
people
got
in
at
some
six
to
eight
weeks
later,
they
had
some
of
them
and
more
of
the
work
papers
that
went
with
them
but
they
were
not
turned
in
mr.
justice
as
a
claim
for
deduction.
they
were
not
turned
in
as
being
true.
they
are
saying,
“here's
what
we
put
together
and
here's
the
basis
on
which
we
did
it.”
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that's
right.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
your
guess
is
as
good
as
mine.
we
say
that
judge
nordbye's
--
they
won't
make
any
findings.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
1945
and
1946
of
the
indictment
years
on.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
they're
saying
this.
cain
said,
“i
didn't
spend
or
just
drop
down
the
line
or
two”,
judge.
he
said,
“i
didn't
spend
$45,000
for
chocolate”.
that's
what
they're
talking
about.
i'm
going
to
say
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
now,
you've
asked
two
or
three
questions.
number
one
--
number
one,
there's
no
question
of
false
statement
in
this
case.
we
weren't
indicted.
number
two,
these
were
turned
over
for
what
they
were
worth
and
they
were
turned
over
with
every
perjury
agent,
saying,
why
they
put
the
disbursements
on
there
at
all.
cain
says,
“well,
i
hope
they'll
think
i'd
paid
out
something.”
everybody
said
at
that
time,
“you're
going
to
get
no
credit
for
whatever
you
put
down
there.”
we
can't
do
it
in
the
perjury
regulations
quoted
in
our
brief
wouldn't
let
it.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no
sir.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
say
it
doesn't
show
whatnot
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination,
not
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination,
not
remotely
by
that.
this
fellow,
lima
said,
he
made
out
of
$20,000
payment
after
he'd
sworn
to
the
grand
jury
that
he
didn't
and
we
finally
drop
it
out
and
we
ask
him,
“how
did
you
arrive
at
the
$20,000?”
“i
don't
know.”
“was
it
for
1945
or
was
it
for
1946?”
“was
it
for
both
years?”
“i
don't
know
but
it
was
$20,000.”
mr.
george
b.
christensen
correct,
you're
correct.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
we
have
that
right.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
but
if
we
--
had
we
done
that
--
had
we
done
that
justice
harlan,
we
of
course
would
add
to
come
in
with
a
claim
for
a
refund.
prove
document
completely
and
precisely,
every
penny
that
we
claimed
as
an
offset.
and
i
want
to
and
i'm
going
to
sit
down
in
just
two
or
three
minutes
because
i
do
wish
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal
and
my
brother
kirby
have
some
time
to
speak.
and
i
haven't
yet
gotten
to
the
issues
about
which
we
complain
so
bitterly
in
our
petition
and
in
our
brief.
you
sent
this
case
back
on
the
basic
ground
that
all
these
the
government
had
told
you
and
i
am
painting
with
the
wide
brush,
i
understand,
but
time
permits
me
to
do
no
other
way.
the
government
came
in
here
and
they
told
you,
we
are
going
to
prove
that
no
disclosure
was
made.
this
is
all
an
utter
perjurious
fabrication.
we
are
going
to
prove
to
you
and
to
any
court
that
mr.
busby
never
reveal
--
that
mr.
graflund
never
revealed
these
transactions
to
mr.
busby
in
january
of
1948,
so
he
could
not
have
made
a
disclosure.
we
are
going
to
prove
to
you
that
huebner
threatened
to
tell
the
truth
on
the
stand
in
1952,
so
they
kept
him
off
the
stand
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
judge
nordbye
return
to
a
pretty
harsh
opinion
against
us
but
he
finds
that
that
claim
to
this
court
was
false
that
busby
did
reveal,
that
busby
did
reveal,
that
graflund
did
reveal
to
busby
in
january
1948
which
was
the
genesis
of
this
disclosure.
when
huebner
got
on
the
stand
and
had
to
face
cross-examination,
he
gave
not
one
syllable
of
this
conspiracy
of
perjury
that
he'd
been
kept
off
the
stand.
and
at
the
time,
the
representations
were
made
to
this
court
that
nothing
like
this
had
taken
place,
the
united
states
prosecutors
had
in
their
possession
sworn
grand
jury
testimony
by
this
fellow
graflund.
yes,
i
told
busby
all
about
this
in
january
and
i
didn't
spare
the
horses
in
telling.
they
had
agent
lima
saying,
“i
never
heard
of
a
$20,000
settlement.
i
never
heard
of
any
corruption
in
this
case.
i
never
heard
of
an
870
form
which
is
the
form
you
use
to
close
a
case
out
with.
that
was
all
in
the
possession
of
the
treasury
department
and
the
prosecutors
in
the
field
at
the
time
we
were
up
here
some
years
ago
having
these
heeded
arguments.
and
we
finally
dragged
it
out.
fortunately,
by
starting
under
jencks
and
progressing
to
the
grand
jury
next.
i
can't
say
what
you
would
have
done
that
you
control
what
the
actual
facts
were
in
1957
when
we
argued
this
case
before.
i
doubt
whether
you
would
render
this
remand.
but
at
least
you
were
entitled
to
know.
and
as
american
citizens,
my
client
were
entitled
to
have
the
united
states
deal
fairly
with
it
and
say
that
either
these
affidavits
that
they
have
now
given
us
after
months
and
months
and
months
of
refresher
courses
and
i
used
the
term
of
the
witness,
lima,
are
false
or
their
repeated
sworn
statements
obtained
by
us
before
this
very
grand
jury
our
perjury
that
lie
behind
this
case.
i've
only
scratched
the
surface
of
it.
you
are
going
to
have
a
hard
time
with
the
briefs.
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i'm
not
saying
that.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i'm
not
saying
that.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i'm
saying
at
some
point
in
the
department
of
justice
and
certainly
the
prosecutors
in
the
field
have
the
knowledge.
i
would
make
no
claim
against
the
solicitor
general.
he
may
have
been
a
little
indulgent
with
his
boys
and
taken
too
much
on
faith.
quite
certainly,
the
solicitor
general
would
not
come
in
here
remotely.
i
don't
think
and
dream
this.
the
record
is
silent
on
it.
i
am
making
no
charges
whatsoever
against
the
solicitor
general.
i
am
making
charges
against
some
of
the
man
in
the
field
who
heard
this
very
evidence,
who'd
obtained
it
and
filed
an
affidavit
that
no
disclosure
had
been
made
and
nothing
like
this
took
place.
now,
where
the
lapse
came,
i
don't
know
but
it
can.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
judge
nordbye
said
the
disclosure
was
made.
he
says
that
it
was
made
before
june
21.
the
government
told
you,
they'd
show
nothing
was
done
before
june
21
and
says
necessarily
it
was
made
before
june
4.
he
quibbles
about
the
date
but
he
says
the
disclosure
was
made.
he
says
it
was
made
in
about
the
way
we
say
it
was
but
because
the
corporate
officers
in
disclosing
on
shotwell
didn't
say
as
he
believes
the
fact
to
be
and
as
we
say
is
not
the
fact
and
in
any
event
is
immaterial
to
shotwell's
taxes
that
the
corporate
officers
got
some
so-called
constructive
dividends
and
should
have
disclosed
upon
themselves
personally
that
this
was
not
in
good
faith
and
therefore
we
forget
about
it.
that,
as
i
understand
it
is
the
gist
of
judge
nordbye's
reason.
thank
you.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
may
it
please
the
court.
the
turn
of
events
this
morning
of
course
has
been
very
interesting
to
us.
i
would
like
however
to
go
back
and
clear
up
a
couple
of
things
on
which
i
was
not
as
precise
as
i
should
have
been
on
questioning
the
other
day.
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
me
to
explain
page
86
of
these
figures.
you
will
recall
when
--
mr.
justice,
you
and
i
were
trying
to
look
at
the
--
that
little
memo
at
the
foot
of
86
added
from
l
records
from
lubben
records?
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that
figure
sir
is
$1633.06.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no.
it
is
carried
over,
you
can
see
it's
carried
across
the
page
here
and
then
added
in
to
the
total
of
$29,000
for
the
year
1944
which
is
not
an
issue
in
the
indictment.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
now,
you
spoke
sir,
a
moment
ago
of
this
being
received
against
the
defendants
as
an
admission.
it
was
so
received
before
the
petit
jury
on
the
trial.
we
say
without
as
until
out
of
evidence
that
it
was
an
admission.
its
reception
was
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
basis.
in
the
face
of
the
evidence,
number
one,
that
it
was
procured
by
a
promise
of
immunity,
and
number
two,
that
all
of
the
evidence
said,
"this
is
what
we
make
out
from
lubben's
records,
go
ahead
and
assess
on
any
basis
you
want."
now
they
--
there
has
been
some
talk
this
morning
of
these
workpapers
and
here
they
are,
all
stretched
up.
here's
a
reproduction
of
them.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes
sir.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
if
you
look
them
over
carefully,
you
will
see
that
the
big
sheets
are
the
supporting
sheets
from
which
the
so-called
recapitulation,
a
little
sheet
is
made
up.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
then
you
will
see
also
that
right
across
the
top
of
it,
they
show
what
this
accountant
was
doing,
memo
taken
from
lubben
record
as
compared
with
our
records.
and
they're
turned
over
to
the
agent,
make
out
of
it
what
you
can.
here
is
what
it
shows.
now,
with
respect
to
the
cash
account
at
the
bottom,
the
disbursement
section,
there
was
some
question
about
that
the
other
day.
and
in
our
brief,
we
say
that
mr.
sauber
never
told
us
to
render
an
account
of
the
disbursements
and
i
was
taken
a
task
of
them.
and
mr.
howard
and
i
do
not
read
the
record
alike.
mr.
howard
says
that
busby
testified
to
that
and
that
cain
testified
to
that
and
that
sullivan
did.
i've
had
the
benefit
of
the
weekend.
i
have
reviewed
that
char
--
testimony
as
carefully
as
i
can.
busby
testified
at
record
181
that
the
payouts
for
raw
materials
were
not
deductible,
they
were
immaterial.
mr.
cain
testified
to
that
general
effect
at
229,
232,
244,
252,
257,
262,
268,
274,
and
he
testified
that
on
the
original
1952
suppression
hearing
before
the
government
puts
sauber
on
the
stand.
sauber
never
testi
--
never
contradicted
that,
but
he
said,
“well,
get
together,
you
people
can't
file
an
amended
return.
you
don't
know
what's
going
on.
reconstruct
an
account
as
best
as
you
can.”
he
said,
“well,
talk
with
everybody
that
knows
about
the
over-ceiling
receipts
and
disbursement.
and
that
and
this
i
think
is
important.
i
think
sauber
was
being
perfectly
alright,
a
little
cute
with
our
people.
he
wanted
to
get
these
payouts,
i
assume
if
he
could
to
lead
on
to
people
who
might
have
received
them
the
old
informer
trying
to
pull
us
along.
he
said
reconstruct
the
figures
for
an
accurate
tax
return.
now
that,
if
it
please
the
court,
gets
us
into
one
of
the
difficulties
that
clouds
everyone's
thinking
and
it's
so
easy
to
do
it.
mr.
sauber
was
speaking
as
of
1948.
and
at
that
time,
these
payouts
were
utterly
immaterial.
we
could
not
take
a
deduction
for
him
whether
we
paid
them
as
constructive
dividends
for
raw
materials
or
anything
else.
by
the
time
of
trial
--
by
the
time
of
trial
in
1952,
the
law
had
trade
and
if
we
could
show
we
paid
out
what
we
took
in
we
had
no
net
income.
now,
there'd
been
talk
about
how
much
this
exaggeration
was.
permit
me
to
take
the
worst
figures
i
can
for
my
clients,
the
figures
which
i
can
backup
from
judge
norbye's
findings
erroneous
though
we
think
some
of
them
are.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no
difference.
no
difference
because
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
--
you
are
talking
--
you
were
talking
solely
of
the
return
to
corporation,
the
shotwell
manufacturing
company.
it
had
to
account
for
all
of
these
as
income,
as
gross
income.
and
until
we
claim
a
deduction
for
it
which
we
couldn't
claim
in
1948
either
as
constructive
dividends,
couldn't
take
that
as
a
deduction
of
course,
nor
as
a
payout
for
raw
materials.
and
what
judge
norbye
has
been
saying
for
years
and
years
and
years
when
you
disclose
on
behalf
of
a
corporation,
you've
also
got
to
tell
if
the
corporation
officers
personally
have
been
up
to
any
hanky-panky.
he
thinks
they
have.
we
say
it
isn't
so.
but
it
would
not
be
material
to
shotwell's
tax
return
on
the
law
as
of
the
time
of
the
1948
disclosure.
now
as
to
the
amount
of
the
exaggeration,
it
was
--
the
government
claimed,
it
proved
$454,000
by
lubben
and
his
book
which
government
proof,
not
our
proof,
government
proof
upon
the
remanded
hearing
showed
had
been
doctored.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
what
it
confronted
it,
it
confronted
it,
mr.
justice
brennan
in
this
posture
with
the
united
state
attorney
standing
up,
not
merely
on
the
theoretical
endorsement
of
the
witness
they're
vouching
for
but
striving
in
front
of
that
jury
saying,
“i'll
tell
you,
david
lubben
is
an
honest
citizen.
this
is
so.
and
his
books
are
correct.”
now
the
government
proof
on
the
remanded
hearing
shows
that
lubben
is
a
confirmed
perjurer
both
graflund
and
huebner
testified
the
instances,
$145,000
payment,
another
sum,
$50,000
of
where
lubben
lied.
this
is
government
evidence
brought
out
by
the
government.
and
government
evidence
out
of
the
mouth
of
huebner,
that
a
treasury
employee,
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
tobias
and
one
time
worked
for
lubben
said,
“yes,
i
worked
with
lubben
doctoring
up
his
books
and
charging
items
up
to
shotwell
they
never
had.”
mr.
george
b.
christensen
it
would
sir.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
it
would
certainly
would,
and
you
were
then
faced
with
precisely
what
you
are
putting
your
finger
on
mr.
justice
black,
when
you
have
admittedly
false
evidence,
exaggerated
evidence,
not
mistaken
evidence.
before
a
jury,
can
a
judge
say,
“well,
i
think
the
exaggeration
wasn't
enough
that
jury
would
have
come
in
and
found
them
guilty
anyway.”
and
we
say
there's
nothing
in
the
history
of
this
court
that
indicates
that
our
right
to
jury
trial
can
be
violated
that
much.
in
the
mesarosh
case
and
the
communist
party
case
i
think
it
was
a
contention
was
made.
well,
there's
enough
valid
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
finding
of
the
subversive
control
board.
this
court
said,
“that
isn't
--
they
answered
it.
get
that
out
of
the
record.
get
detained
off
and
let
the
tribunal
take
a
fresh
look
at
it.”
now,
the
--
there
was
a
question
in
this
process
of
the
graflund
conversion
to
this
new
story
in
which
the
chronology
was
quite
involved
the
other
day.
if
i
might
take
a
moment
to
give
you
that,
graflund
testified
as
a
government
witness
on
the
original
trial,
he
was
asked,
nothing
particularly
relevant
to
the
disclosure
although
he
had
been
thoroughly
interviewed.
and
the
notes
that
were
brought
out
in
the
remanded
hearing
showed
that.
when
the
reinvestigation
started,
he
was
interviewed
by
the
treasury
on
november
8,
1955.
he
didn't
tell
the
story
about
this
of
being
true.
on
may
10,
1956,
the
prosecutors
who
had
a
grand
jury
working
interviewed
him
at
great
length.
on
august
28,
29,
and
30,
1956,
he
was
before
the
grand
jury
and
he
said,
“i
revealed
all
of
these
to
busby
on
a
train
in
january.
i
told
them
all
about
it.
that's
the
starting
place
of
the
disclosure.”
he
was
very
graphic
about
it.
he
put
in
details
that
no
one
had
ever
heard
of.
now
the
proceeding
is
going
on
here.
the
motion
to
remand
was
filed
in
this
court
on
october
15,
1956
in
an
amendment
form
a
month
later.
and
on
the
24th
of
november
1956,
we
filed
our
answer
to
the
motion
to
remand
in
which
we
tried
to
be
as
vigorous
as
we
could
and
we
were
unconvincing
to
the
court.
we
said
this
is
hearsay,
all
you've
got
is
a
hearsay
affidavit
from
a
treasury
detective
and
a
government
lawyer.
where
are
the
witnesses?
what
are
they
talking
about?
the
prosecutors
then
went
back
to
mr.
lubben
on
february
3rd,
1957.
and
they
made
no
record
of
what
happened
upon
that
interrogation.
so
i
assume
he
didn't
change
his
testimony.
they
went
back
at
him
and
got
him
in
for
another
session
on
february
17,
1957.
and
again,
they
made
no
notes
or
record
of
that
one.
so,
we
must
assume
that
was
unsuccessful.
but
on
february
20,
1957
for
the
first
time,
mr.
lubben
said,
“oh”
--
or
mr.
graflund
said,
“oh,
it's
a
mistake.
i've
never
told
this
to
busby
on
the
train.
nothing
like
that
happened.
i
went
out
to
see
him
in
july
and
he
was
startled
to
hear
there'd
been
any
black
market
transactions."
and
then
several
months
later
on
august
17,
1957,
his
affidavit
to
that
effect
was
filed
here.
that
is
the
chronology
of
graflund,
its
set
forth
in
a
chronology
attached
to
our
brief.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
(inaudible)
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
the
materiality
of
it
to
the
suppression
issue
mr.
justice
black,
is
this.
and
it's
very
material,
it's
crucial
in
my
humble
judgment.because
my
people
have
always
said,
“the
reason
we
made
the
disclosure
was
because
our
tax
adviser,
our
tax
accountant,
busby
told
us
to.
we've
never
had
any
other
--
never
made
any
other
statement
as
to
the
genesis
of
the
disclosure.”
and
the
significance
then
of
the
affidavit
to
you
that
graflund
or
that
busby
knew
nothing
about
this
until
the
following
july
is
pre
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
oh,
when
the
--
when
the
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
the
investigation
of
the
government
never
started
except
as
a
consequence
of
this
disclosure.
they
made
no
independence
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
it
started
about
--
lima
came
out
on
august
1st,
but
the
case
had
been
started
in
the
chicago
office
and
was
delayed
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
we
say
it
started
when
we
talked
to
sauber
which
was
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no,
there
was
not.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no,
there
was
not.
there
was
not
an
issue
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
--
before
the
jury.
there
was
an
issue
on
the
suppression
of
this
evidence
obtained
by
promises
of
immunity.
this
came
out
on
the
suppression
hearing,
on
the
voluntary
disclosure.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
it
became
material
of
1952
when
they
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
motion
to
suppress.
the
government's
theory
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
its
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
the
original
indictment.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
it's
so
confusing
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
--
that
this
will
take
me
off
on
a
little
different
attack.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
at
that
time
--
at
that
time,
the
government
said,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
you
did
anytime
in
1948,
the
time
--
your
last
date
of
the
disclosure
was
in
december
1947.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
it
was
right
through.
it
was
until
after
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case
in
1955.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
the
government
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
there
was
testimony
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
--
you
would
see
a
testimony
as
to
what
--
as
to
how
files
tax
returns
are
sent
to
washington
and
what
constitutes
the
initiation
of
an
investigation.
the
government
took
the
unsound
position
that
the
timeliness
date
fell
in
december
of
1947
and
that
anything
my
people
did
after
that
was
not
untimely.
they
have
long
since
abandoned
that
position.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes
sir.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no
sir.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no.
what?
now,
i
have
got
to
sit
down
if
it
please
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
you
are
not
mistaken.
that
was
the
main
allegation
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
was
made
here.
they
tipped
their
theory
upside
down
and
when
they
came
in
with
these
remand
proceedings.
now,
they
said
the
timeliness
date
was
june
20
or
21,
1948
and
we're
going
to
show
you
nothing
happened
prior
to
that
date.
and
that
went
--
that
what
went
back
to
judge
norbye
and
they
couldn't
demonstrate
it
and
judge
nor
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
precisely.
now,
before
i
sit
down
and
i've
only
scratch
the
surface
of
the
constitutional
doctrine
that
obtains
here.
i've
only
haven't
touch
upon
the
argument
that
you
don't
let
confessional
material
in
because
it's
false.
according
to
dean
wigmore,
that's
why
you
keep
it
out
material
obtained
by
a
promise
of
immunity.
and
there
is
in
this
case
and
we
think
of
tremendous
importance
to
the
entire
country
and
not
peculiar
to
the
facts
of
this,
a
question
of
jury
selection
procedures.
this
record
establishes
indisputably
that
the
court
commissioners
elected
not
a
one
of
the
grand
jurors,
not
a
one
of
the
petit
jurors
in
this
case.
we
have
challenged
the
department
time
after
time
show
any
evidence
in
this
record
that
mr.
crux
picked
out
a
juror.
show
any
evidence
that
volunteers
were
lawful
at
this
time.
the
jury
question
is
one
that
cuts
under
everything
here
and
we
think
there's
a
tremendous
importance
to
the
court.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
they
say
we
did
not.
we
say
we
did.
we
didn't
find
out
about
these
facts
until
the
case
was
pending
in
this
court
that
after
this
court
had
set
aside
the
judgments
and
you
will
--
mr.
justice
harlan
will
recall,
in
your
opinion
you
used
the
phrase,
“justice
is
not
a
one
way
street”.
with
the
case
reopened
to
go
back
to
a
pretrial
suppression
of
evidence
hearing,
we
said
reopen
this
to
let
us
move
to
dismiss
this
indictment
on
the
ground
of
a
new
legal
grand
jury
and
the
verdict
on
the
ground
of
an
illegal
petit
jury
and
they
say,
“we
aren't
timely."
then
we
say
justice
is
not
a
one
way
street.
in
the
unusual
twist
and
turn,
this
case
is
taken
as
quickly
as
we
found
out
that
contrary
to
the
presumption
that
public
officials
are
doing
their
duty,
that
crux
just
wasn't
doing
anything
except
exercise
in
ceremonial
functions,
we
proved
this
matter.
and
there
was
a
hearing.
it's
in
the
briefs.
i
haven't
the
time.
i'm
beyond
my
time
as
you
can
see.
but
we
think
