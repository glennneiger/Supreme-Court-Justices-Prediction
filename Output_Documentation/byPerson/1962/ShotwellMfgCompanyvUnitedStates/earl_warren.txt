mr.
christensen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
he
was
busby.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
contradictory
testimony
on
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
cain
and
sullivan
were
told?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kirby.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
howard.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
rather
important
thing,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
busby
had
made
a
mistake?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
the
only
thing
that
judge
nordbye
questioned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
it
was
beforehand,
why
weren't
we
advised
of
this
change?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
man
whose
affidavit
you
presented
to
us
had
repudiated
his
affidavit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
what
he
testified
to
before
judge
nordbye.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
that
the
court
below
has
done
it
but
you
were
passing
on
it
yourselves,
were
you
not,
without
giving
us
both
sides
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
howard,
if
the
jury
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
judge
nordbye
came
to
that
he
did
not
testify
but
didn't
say
accurately
if
he
wish
on
the
date
of
disclosure,
would
that
in
your
opinion
had
been
an
important
fact
in
this
decision?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
and
did
you
have
anyone
to
testify
that
it
didn't
occur
until
later?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
wanted
this
to
give
credibility
to
his
present
affidavit,
didn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
howard.

mr.
oberdorfer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
is
on
remand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
oberdorfer,
when
the
case
was
here
before,
the
government
files
certain
affidavits
with
us
and
said
that
the
witnesses
would
so
testify
if
the
case
went
back.
and
the
government
also
said
that
those
cases
--
that
those
affidavits
would
prove
perjury
on
the
part
of
the
defendants,
the
petitioners
here.
and
the
--
and
also
that
it
would
possibly
show
corruption
in
the
internal
revenue
department.
now
may
i
ask
you,
if
judge
norbye,
in
this
hearing
on
remand,
found
that
those
affidavits
had
the
effect
that
you
represented
to
--
now,
you
--
i
mean
the
government
represented
to
this
court
that
they
would
have,
if
the
government
had
an
opportunity
to
have
a
hearing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
isn't
the
finding
that
these
affidavits
of
yours
were
true.
on
the
contrary,
i
thought
judge
norbye
found
that
they
were
not
true
in
very
material
respects.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
they
point
out
to
you.
i
may
be
mistaken
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
the
record
but
i
thought
that
if
the
original
hearing
and
that
--
and
possibly
at
the
trial,
one
of
the
crucial
questions
was
whether
the
defendants
have
had
ever
started
to
make
a
disclosure
to
the
government
or
had
ever
made
any
mention
of
it
to
the
authorities
on
or
before
june
21st
of
this
year,
i
think
that
the
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
was.
the
defendants
claiming
that
they
--
that
they
started
making
it
on
january
18th,
and
the
government
contending
that
it
was
not
made
until
the
21st
of
june.
and
your
affidavits
that
were
here,
as
i
remember
them,
showed
that
you
have
the
testimony
that
would
prove
that
the
defendants
had
committed
perjury
in
asserting
that
they
had
started
and
had
informed
the
government
on
january
18th.
and
as
i
understood
it,
judge
norbye
found
that
the
affidavits
that
you
submitted
to
us
were
not
true,
and
that
in
all
probability,
the
defendants
were
right
in
their
testimony
that
they
had
brought
this
thing
to
the
attention
of
the
government
before
the
21st
of
june.
and
in
all
probability,
it
was
on
the
18th
of
january,
as
they
said
in
the
course
of
a
train
ride
from
chicago
to
some
other
place.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
it
did
not
happen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
it
was
june
21st.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
he
also
said
and
possibly
on
this
ride
on
january
18th,
am
i
wrong
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
you
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
record
better
than
i
do,
we'll
see
it
later
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
i'm
wrong
on
it,
why
was
the
(voice
overlap)
wrong
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
claimed
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
there
was
perjury
in
being
wrong
and
yours
was
just
exaggeration
or
a
mistake.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
he
might've
become
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mistaken
but
in
that
--
in
--
at
all
events,
the
affidavits
that
you
gave
us
here
to
the
effect
that
the
perjury
would
be
shown
was
not
substantiated
by
judge
norbye's
theory.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
say
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that's
different.
that
wasn't
the
affidavit
that
was
made
here
to
cause
this
court
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
do
what
it
did.
the
thing
that
caused
the
court
to
do
what
it
did
was
the
fact
that
you
--
the
government
made
certain
representations
here
that
the
result
below
on
the
suppression
was
arrived
at
because
the
defendants
had
engaged
in
perjury
and
fraud
in
connection
with
the
testimony.
and
you
filed
affidavits
in
support
of
that.
and
the
case
went
back.
and
as
i
â€“
as
i
have
read
the
record,
i
haven't
read
it
all,
but
as
i've
read
it,
judge
norbye
did
not
support
you
insofar
as
those
affidavits
were
concerned.
he
took
the
whole
testimony
that
he
had
taken
before
at
the
motion
on
suppression,
thrust
these
things
and
then
he
rationalized
all
of
them
and
said
as
a
package,
it
showed
convincingly
that
fraud
had
been
performed.
but
what
i
want
to
know
from
you
is
what
testimony
you
brought
to
this
case
as
a
result
of
those
affidavits
that
were
presented
to
this
court
that
caused
him
to
change
his
mind
or
that
caused
him
to
find
that
conclusively
that
this
was
untimely
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
is
--
that
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
it
was
fraudulent.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
judge
make
a
finding
that
that
was
fraudulent
or
that
it
was
merely
a
suspicious
circumstance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
find
that
was
fraud
within
the
bureau
or
as
you
represented
it,
it
would
show?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
hearing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
this
hearing
proved
any
fraud
in
the
department
of
internal
revenue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
any
terms?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
didn't
want
you
--
told
us
about
the
conversation?
you
said
possible
fraud
in
this
court
using
some
other
authorities
where
the
defendant
had
been
convicted
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
questionable
testimony,
gave
the
same
benefit
of
doubt
to
the
government
and
gave
you
a
chance
to
go
back
to
the
court
and
use
these
affidavits.
now
it
seems
to
me,
it's
terribly
important
whether
or
not,
the
judge
found
these
affidavits
that
the
government
made
to
us,
word
in
all
essentials
true
or
substantially
true.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
oberdorfer,
another
thing
that
i
was
wondering
about.
i
noticed
from
the
dates
here
that
it
would
be
five
years
tomorrow
since
this
court
remanded
that
case,
what
is
the
explanation
of
that
five
years
in
having
a
simple
remand
of
that
kind
and
it
coming
back
to
this
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
a
few
months
since
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
we
will
take
that
out
of
five
years,
that
isn't
very
important.
chief
justice
earl
warren
takes
a
few
more
months
out.
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
four
years
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
four
years,
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
year
for
those
things
and
four
years
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
having
a
simple
remand
on
the
case
of
this
kind
on
facts
that
go
back
to
1946.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
--
i
noticed
that
the
indictment
was
not
filed
until
the
last
day
before
the
statute
of
limitations
right,
six
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
it
took
five
years
from
that
date
to
get
to
this
court,
we
remand
it
and
it
takes
five
years
for
it
to
come
back,
isn't
that
a
commentary
on
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
he
was
a
black
marketeer
with
these
people
as
you
allege
them
to
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
mr.
oberdorfer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
christensen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
make
time
of
the
objection
to
that?
