mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
discuss
in
the
remaining
time
available
to
the
government
the
defendant's
contention
that
the
individual
defendants
have
been
compelled
to
be
witnesses
against
themselves
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
and
that
the
so-called
voluntary
disclosure
that
was
made
in
this
--
at
the
administrative
stage
in
this
case
should
not
have
been
admitted
in
evidence
during
the
trial.
the
voluntary
disclosure
policy
of
the
internal
revenue
service
and
the
treasure
department
prevailed
for
a
period
in
the
1940s
until
1952.
that
policy
was
a
corollary
of
our
self-assessment
federal
tax
system.
that
system
assumes
that
when
--
that
the
individuals
assess
themselves
that
they
--
when
they
make
out
of
tax
return,
they
write
down
on
the
return
the
true
facts
of
their
liability,
their
income,
and
their
deductions,
and
they
file
it.
and
it
is
from
this
that
their
civil
liability
is
established.
the
voluntary
disclosure
policy
in
the
period
that
we're
discussing
developed,
as
i
say,
is
a
corollary
of
that
self-assessment
system.
it
was
understood
by
the
then
tax
authorities
that
during
world
war
ii
because
manpower
--
enforcement
manpower
were
short
because
of
the
temptations
of
war
time
business
and
a
lot
of
other
things,
that
people
may
not
and
many
people
may
not
have
met
their
tax
--
their
civil
tax
obligations
on
the
return
date.
and
the
voluntary
disclosure
policy
was
adopted
not
to
empty
the
jails
and
not
to
forgive
people
for
crime,
but
to
collect
the
taxes
that
might
have
been
missed
in
those
circumstances.
and
the
policy
was
essentially
very
simple.
a
person
who
had
omitted
income
or
understated
his
taxable
income
was
told
in
a
general
statement
that
if
before
an
investigation
had
been
begun
of
his
tax
return,
particular
year,
he
came
in
and
made
a
voluntary
disclosure
which
presumed
in
its
context
and
i
--
we
say
in
its
text,
that
the
taxpayer
told
all
the
facts
were
necessary
to
establish
his
civil
liability
and
cooperated
in
the
settlement
of
it
that
he
would,
having
paid
the
civil
liability
and
his
civil
penalties
that
mightily
do,
other
government
would
not
prosecute
him
for
the
crime
of
tax
evasion.
in
this
case,
we
have
--
so
far
as
this
voluntary
disclosure
is
concerned,
the
question
a
of
whether
the
disclosure
was
timely,
that
is
whether
it
was
made
before
an
investigation
had
begun.
and
secondly,
whether
the
other
terms
of
the
policy
were
met
namely
that
the
taxpayer
cooperated
with
the
authorities
in
achieving
what
was
the
basic
objective
of
the
policy
namely;
the
establishment
and
payment
of
a
civil
liability.
in
the
posture
of
the
case
now,
we
do
not
contend
that
the
so-called
statement
was
untimely.
we
acquiesce
in
judge
norbye's
finding
that
the
disclosure
occurred
before
an
investigation
had
begun.
we
do
contend,
and
this
is
one
of
the
areas,
it's
already
been
discussed
on
the
facts
that
not
only
did
these
defendants
fail
to
cooperate
in
the
determination
of
their
civil
liability.
they
didn't
just
sit
silent
and
wait
to
be
pursued
which
might
be
a
questionable
case.
they
affirmatively
and
overtly
attempted
to
deceive
the
authorities
as
to
their
civil
liability
acting
under
the
smoke
screen
of
their
so-called
voluntary
disclosure.
the
courts
have
had,
the
lower
courts
have
already
had
cases
involving
the
question
of
whether
a
so-called
voluntary
disclosure
made
after
an
investigation
had
begun,
was
admissible
in
evidence.
and
the
second
circuit
among
others
has
held
that
an
untimely
disclosure
that
is
one
begun
after
an
investigation,
one
made
after
an
investigation
has
begun
is
not
admissible.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
these
cases
include
cases
where
the
taxpayer
was
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
the
investigation
had
begun.
(inaudible)
and
the
lower
courts
have
nevertheless
held
that
such
disclosures
are
admissible
in
evidence
because
the
terms
of
the
voluntary
disclosure
policy
which
are
fairly
clear
were
not
met.
and
as
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
relative.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
mr.
justice
goldberg,
there
are
some
additional
remarks
in
that
particular
speech
which
i'll
just
quote.
“in
excusing
the
man
from
criminal
prosecution,
we
are
merely
taking
a
sensible
step
to
produce
the
revenue
called
for
by
law
with
the
minimum
cost
of
investigation.
the
man
who
makes
a
voluntary
disclosure
saves
us
a
lot
of
money
in
investigating.
in
return,
we
can
spare
him
a
turn
in
jail.
this
is
your
business
from
his
standpoint
and
it
is
good
business
from
the
government's
standpoint.
that's
as
far
as
once
your
statement
itself
is
concerned.
in
addition,
this
statement
of
secretary
schneider
on
may
25,
1947,
which
was
subsequent
to
mr.
wancho's
statement
which
was
before
the
so-called
voluntary
disclosure
in
this
case
and
which
is
perhaps
more
authoritative
than
mr.
wancho
said
having
described
the
voluntary
disclosure
policy,
“this
presumes
of
course,
that
the
recipient
taxpayer
cooperates
with
agents
of
the
bureau
in
determining
the
true
tax
liability”.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
we
have
to
concede,
mr.
justice,
that
there
was
never
a
ruling
or
a
regulation
having
the
formality
and
the
precision
of
the
(inaudible)
state,
that
certainly
true.
but
the
whole
context
of
the
policy,
we
believe,
puts
--
put
any
taxpayer
on
notice
that
even
if
he
--
if
he,
in
this
case
for
example,
had
come
to
the
treasury
and
said,
“i
know
i've
received
some
unreported
income.
i'm
not
sure
of
what
i
did
with
it.
or
even,
i
don't
care
to
tell
you
what
i
did
with
it.”
that
would
be
one
thing.
this
is
a
case
where
the
taxpayer
said
that
he'd
received
some
unreported
income.
but
then
came
in
affirmatively
and
attempted
to
mislead
by
a
series
of
actions,
a
series
of
statements,
and
by
the
finding
of
documents,
a
filing
which
almost
has
the
dignity
of
the
filing
of
an
amended
return.
and
this
series
of
representations,
oral
representations
to
mr.
sauber,
the
filing
of
documents
to
mr.
lima,
and
the
evidence
we
have
of
an
attempt
to
fix
the
case
by
a
settlement
which
presumed
that
the
fictitious
expenditures
had
in
fact
been
made.
all
those
things
are
not
mere
passive
acquiescence.
actually,
they
are
acts.
they
are
steps
in
the
commission
of
the
crime
that's
charged
here,
namely
the
evasion
of
taxes
from
1945
and
1946.
mr.
justice
goldberg,
you
asked
the
other
day
about
whether
the
filing
of
those
statements
was
a
crime
and
the
answer
that
we
gave
at
that
time
may
have
suggested
merely
that
it
was
a
separate
crime
punishable
by
a
separate
indictment.
but
the
fact
is,
under
this
--
particularly
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
beacon
brass
case
of
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
this
particular
act
or
this
series
of
acts
are,
as
i
say,
steps
in
the
commission
of
the
crime
that
was
tried
here.
and
you
recall
that
taxpayer's
counsel
suggested
that
this
indictment
was
brought
on
the
eve
of
the
exploration
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
under
the
beacon
brass
case,
the
statute
of
limitations
began
to
run
all
over
again
when
these
taxpayers
made
these
fraudulent
representations
which
i
say
almost
have
the
dignity
of
an
amended
return.
there
is
a
question
lurking
here
as
to
whether
or
not
assuming
as
we
do
in
this
judge
norbye
found
that
these
representations
were
fraudulent.
you
recall
it,
judge
norbye
found
in
--
i
quote
his
statement
on
page
1766
of
the
appendix.
the
defendants
made
a
dishonest,
faults
and
fraudulent
disclosure
because
such
a
disclosure
did
not
conform
to
the
true
facts.
the
so-called
voluntary
disclosure
was
concocted
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
misleading
the
tax
official.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
not
in
those
terms,
mr.
justice
black.
the
original
jury
was
charged
that
if
it
found
that
the
payments
received
by
the
defendant
corporation
were
expended
for
inventory,
the
jury
should
acquit
the
defendants.
and
we
say
that
the
conviction,
the
verdict
of
conviction
necessarily
reflects
a
finding
of
fact
by
the
jury
that
whatever
happened
to
the
money,
a
large
sum
of
it
did
not
--
was
not
spent
in
the
inventory.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
by
buttressed,
there
was
--
the
matter
was
not
referred
back
to
the
jury.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
there
was
--
there
was
a
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
there
was
additional
--
there
was
evidence
that
proved
not
only
that
the
funds
were
not
expanded
for
inventory.
there
was
evidence
which
judge
norbye
found
in
support
of
his
conclusion,
his
finding
of
fact
that
the
money
which
had
been
represented
to
have
been
spent
for
inventory
actually
was
taken
out
of
the
corporation
by
the
individual
defendants.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that
was
not
established
that
they
were
--
although,
that
--
there
was
evidence
to
that
effect
at
the
original
trial.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
not
necessary
to
the
verdict,
no
sir.
it
was
not
necessary
to
the
verdict
that
the
money
found
its
way
into
the
individual's
pockets.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
the
timeliness
was
not
an
issue
before
the
jury
as
i
recall
it
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
this
court's
previous
opinion
and
decision
and
disposition
of
the
case
confirmed
what
the
--
in
effect,
confirmed
what
the
lower
courts
had
done
namely,
tried
this
issue
of
admissibility
to
the
judge.
the
--
as
i
recall
it,
the
defendants
requested
in
their
original
motions
to
suppress
that
the
matter
be
tried
to
the
judge.
and
this
proceeding
that
is
--
followed
this
court's
opinion,
namely,
the
second
suppression
hearing
is
in
effect
a
continuation
of
the
original
suppression
hearing
before
the
judge.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
oh,
yes
sir
they
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
before
the
petit
juries.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
the
--
if
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
black,
the
--
what
happened
before
the
jury
has
not
been
disturbed
at
all
by
the
suppression
hearing.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
the
jury's
verdict
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
sir?
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
mr.
justice
black,
the
finding
of
judge
norbye
about
the
dimension
of
the
word
exaggeration
if
i
may
so,
sir,
has
been
exaggerated
in
turn.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
i
will
--
i'll
address
myself
to
that.
the
--
in
an
income
tax
--
criminal
income
tax
case,
the
government
does
not
have
the
burden
of
proving
the
exact
amount
of
the
gross
income
or
deductions
or
taxable
income
that
has
been
erroneously
and
fraudulently
reported.
it's
enough
and
if
--
and
this
court
has
held
that,
it's
enough
to
have
proof
that
there
was
a
substantial
amount
relatively
speaking.
now
judge
norbye's
finding
about
exaggeration
on
the
part
of
the
witness
lubben
is
followed
by
this
if
i
may
quote
it
and
then
i'll
come
back
directly
to
your
question,
sir.
but
the
evidence
is
overwhelmingly
clear
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
1758
of
the
appendix.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
this
is
the
motion
--
this
is
the
supplemental
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
but
the
evidence
is
overwhelmingly
clear
that
not
only
were
substantial
sums
of
black
market
money
paid
to
shotwell
as
premium
payments
by
lubben
during
1944,
1945,
and
1946,
totaling
between
$300,000
and
$400,000.
but
also
that
the
greater
part
of
this
so-called
black
money
--
market
money
was
appropriated
by
cain,
huebner,
and
sullivan
for
their
own
personal
use.
so
that
what
judge
norbye
found
--
still,
even
though
he
suggested
that
perhaps
this
witness
may
have
exaggerated
and
he
didn't
challenge
his
good
faith
in
this
respect.
he
still
found
a
substantial,
a
very
gross
amount
of
omitted
income
more
than
enough
to
have
supported
the
original
verdict
of
the
jury
if
the
evidence
had
been
$300,000
or
$400,000
rather
than
whatever
it
was
at
the
trial.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that
was
their
con
--
that
was
their
contention
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
but
we
must
measure
the
alleged
exaggeration
and
we
find
that
even
exaggerated,
there
was
--
judge
norbye
found
that
the
evidence
was
overwhelmingly
clear,
that's
his
word,
that
the
amount
on
--
admitted
--
the
amounts
submitted
were
between
$300,000
and
$400,000.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
we
--
we
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
we
say
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
one
further
answer,
mr.
justice
black.
we
don't
believe
that
if
this
additional
evidence
that
was
produced
at
the
supplemental
hearing
had
been
offered
in
support
of
a
timely
motion
for
new
trial.
then
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
under
the
authorities
that
a
new
trial
would
have
been
justified
by
that
offer
for
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
we
--
we've
not
and
not
--
the
only
answer
that
the
--
the
final
answer
that
i
can
--
that
i
would
give,
your
honor
is
that
the
alleged
exaggeration
was
in
effect
de
minimis
and
it
was
not
material
to
the
result
and
it
would
not
have
supported
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
but
i
can't
find
the
reference
your
honor.
on
the
--
i
refer
to
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice
to
page
1770
of
the
appendix.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page,
judge
norbye
in
a
--
our
quoting,
on
this
record
in
view
of
the
convincing
evidence,
there
must
be
a
finding
and
i
do
so
find
that
fraud
permeated
the
showing
made
by
these
defendants
before
me
at
the
original
suppression
hearing
as
well
in
to
--
as
at
the
trial,
in
the
supplemental
hearing.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
as
i
recall
it,
the
only
place
where
--
the
only
one
item
which
--
i
don't
think
that
judge
norbye
found
that
our
affidavits
were
not
true.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
1948.
but
i
(voice
overlap)
--
the
government
1948,
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
on
the
suppression
hearing
if
judge
norbye
reached
the
conclusion
that
we
were
right
when
we
said
that
it
didn't
happen
in
january
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
did
not
happen
in
january.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that
it
--
did
not
happen
before
march
15th.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that
it
--
but
they
--
but
judge
norbye
was
compelled
to
conclude
that
it
occurred
sometime
relatively
shortly
before
june
21st,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
just
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it
was
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it
was
--
we
were
both
--
i
think
that
--
i
think
the
complete
answer,
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
we
were
both
wrong.
that
is,
that
it
didn't
occur
in
january.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
and
that
it
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it
was
a
--
the
--
if
the
--
if
your
honor
when
you
examine
judge
norbye's
discussion
of
the
testimony
of
mr.
graflund,
he
explains
that
mr.
--
when
mr.
graflund's
affidavit
was
presented
here,
mr.
graflund
then
believed
and
incidentally
subsequently
testified
as
he
--
as
his
affidavit
indicated
he
would,
as
to
the
date
of
the
episode
at
busby's
home.
graflund
denying
that
the
train
ride
had
occurred.
judge
norbye
traces
graflund's
thinking
process
on
this.
graflund
never
repudiated
his
affidavit.
graflund's
affidavit
was
traversed
by
other
evidence
and
he
was
crossed
examined.
and
judge
norbye
concluded
that
graflund
was
mistaken
in
his
affidavit
and
explains
how
he
became
mistaken.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
not
it
--
not
completely
so.
there
was
the
--
in
other
words,
there
was
a
--
i
think
i
just
--
i
wish
i
could
put
my
finger
right
on
it
but
i
believe
that
judge
norbye
agreed
with
us
that
this
episode
of
january
did
not
occur
in
january,
it
didn't
occur
anytime
during
the
winter.
i
believe
judge
norbye
also
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes
sir,
i
wish
somebody
would
--
if
i
can
put
my
finger
on
that
finding.
also
judge
--
i
believe
judge
norbye
concluded
that
the
preparation
of
the
material
to
be
submitted
did
not
begin
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
again.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
he
didn't
find
that
it
was
untimely,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
concede
that
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
--
that
it
was
fraudulent.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
the
particular
things
that
i
would
point
to
are
first
of
all
the
testimony
of
huebner
who
was
an
employee
who
did
not
testify
at
the
original
trial.
and
who,
in
the
supplemental
hearing,
testified
with
precision
that
had
not
been
available
before
as
to
the
disbursement
of
this
money
to
the
individual
defendants.
we
also
brought
in
as
it
was
--
as
we'd
advised
the
court
at
the
time
the
case
was
here
before,
the
testimony
relating
to
the
report
that
had
been
prepared
by
revenue
agent
lima
which
would
have
settled
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
fictitious
expenditures
had
in
fact
been
incurred.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
he
--
it
was
regard
to
lima's
report,
he
found
that
lima
had
prepared
such
a
report
and
then
had
destroyed
it
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
--
which
was
new.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
don't
think
that
he
actually
reached
the
conclusion
that
that
was
in
so
many
words
fraud.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it
was
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
not
in
those
terms,
no
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
no
sir.
it
did
prove
that
there
had
been
conversations
on
the
taxpayer's
side.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
he
did
not
find
in
so
many
--
in
terms
that
as
a
matter
--
as
a
conclusion,
that
fraud
had
been
committed
in
the
internal
revenue
service.
he
found
specific
facts
which
could
have
led
to
that
conclusion
but
he
was
not
--
he
did
not
reach
the
final
conclusion
that
there
was
in
fact
fraud.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
we
found
that
there
was
a
conversation
about
that
but
he
never
found
that
that
had
actually
been
paid
to
an
internal
revenue
service
officer
within
the
corporation.
there
had
been
--
there
was
--
there
were
statements
made
which
could
have
led
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
fraud
but
in
answer
to
chief
justice's
question,
i
can't
say
that
the
court
below
found,
in
fact,
that
there
are,
as
a
conclusion
of
law,
that
there
was
fraud.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
part
of
--
part
of
the
explanation
is
the
delay
of
few
months
of
it,
the
delay
on
account
of
the
illness
of
one
of
the
defendants.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that
--
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
and
part
of
it,
this
case
was
supposed
to
have
been
argued
here
last
spring
which
accounts
for
a
few
more
months.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
and
other
than
that,
so
far
as
i
know,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was
the
grinding
process
of
getting
ready
for
this
proceeding
and
conducting
it.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it
should
not
have
take
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it
should
not
have
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes,
yes.
this
is
a
serious
problem.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
right,
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it
is
a
--
it
is
a
factor
that
has
concerned
--
concerned
us.
if
your
honor
will
look
at
this
record
in
that
view,
i
think
you
will
observe
that
the
defense
has
been
very
active
in
this
matter.
they
have
made
motions.
they
are
--
i
have
one
thing
that
pops
into
my
mind
is
a
recollection
of
a
proceeding
on
remand
to
disqualify
judge
norbye
on
the
proceedings
on
remand.
there
have
been
number
of
motions
to
assign
the
case
to
different
judges
that
the
case
--
i
don't
think
that
the
government
or
the
court
below
is
entirely
responsible
for
the
time
it's
been
consumed.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
in
the
original
trial,
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
--
principal
witness
was
mr.
lubben.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
and
his
bookkeepers.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
don't
remember
their
names
now
but
mr.
--
miss
feldman.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
because
mr.
lubben
testified
--
mr.
lubben
was
the
customer
to
whom
the
sales
and
over-ceiling
prices
were
made
and
who
paid
the
amounts
which
the
defendants
were
accused
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
--
of
omitting.
sir?
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
he
was
their
customer
and
he
paid
them
more
than
the
o.p.a.
ceiling
for
the
merchandise
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes
sir,
i
believe
so.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
have
--
i
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
believe
that
he
didn't
make
some
remark
to
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
don't
--
it
wasn't
mr.
lubben's
evidence
that
was
supported
by
these
affidavits,
it
was
--
you
see,
mr.
lubben
didn't
have
--
was
not
a
witness
to
the
distribution
of
the
money.
this
was
--
so
to
say,
to
support
his
testimony,
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
-–
i
think
isn't
correct,
it
was
to
--
it
was
some
additional
relevant
evidence
that
wasn't
available
to
him
as
a
witness.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
exaggerated.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
this
could
have
been
develop
on
cross-examination
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
right.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
suppress.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
wish
i
could
be
clear
about
this
but
it
is
my
impression
that
the
--
first
of
all,
that
the
evidence
which
caused
judge
norbye
to
say
that
mr.
lubben
exaggerated
was
not
available
to
the
government
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
but
i
don't
concede
that
this
evidence
would
have
if
--
would
have
supported
a
timely
--
sustained
a
timely
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
the
--
if
--
the
--
i
come
back
to
the
finding
of
fact
that
i
quoted
that
even
if
lubben
was
exaggerating
there
was
still
--
i
forget
the
adverb
now,
overwhelmingly
clear
demonstration
that
the
crime
had
been
committed
in
substantially
the
way
that
it
had
been
presented.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
this
was
offered
by
the
government
in
rebuttal.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
the
government
got
it
originally
when
it
was
handed
to
revenue
agent
lima
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
--
in
august
of
1948.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
by
busby,
i
--
by
the
auditor
for
shotwell,
by
busby
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it
was
offered
as
an
admission.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it
was
offered
as
rebuttal.
as
--
in
as
--
but
if
--
i
--
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
it
was
offered
as
an
admission
(inaudible).
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
as
i
recall
it
in
the
proceedings,
it
--
lubben's
tabulation
on
page
19
of
our
brief
shows
the
total.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
of
lubben,
now
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
$453,
872.40.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
a
hundred
--
that
a
$100,000.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
they
did
do
a
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
their
own
admissions
and
the
--
their
own
admissions
plus
the
testimony
of
lubben's
bookkeeper.
of
course,
in
turn,
this
is
a
tangled
web.
part
of
their
admission
is
based
on
information
that
they
got
from
lubben.
they
had
conversations
with
lubben.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
correct.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
--
i'd
--
i
believe
this
explanation
was
made
at
the
trial.
it
was
certainly
made
here
the
other
day
that
this
admission
was
prepared
by
the
defendants
as
they
say
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution.
they
claimed
they
exaggerated.
the
jury
had
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
a
logical
possibility
although
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
correct.
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
sir?
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
on
the
stand
--
let's
see.
the
(inaudible)
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
they
had
--
they
--
it
seems
to
me
they
admitted
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
$150,000
out
of
their
own
mouths.
that
is
the
testimony.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
purchases.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
they
were
--
the
jury
was
specifically
charged
on
that
issue.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
the
jury
was
charged
on
that.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
he
was.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
had
the
impression
and
i'm
sorry
to
be
fuzzy
on
this
because
i
should
be
precise.
i
had
the
impression
that
the
thing
that
convinced
judge
norbye
that
the
visit
occurred
before
june
29
--
21st
was
a
exchange
of
--
in
the
hospital
with
a
mr.
horgan,
this
was
just
a
few
days
before
june
21.
and
i
had
the
impression
that
judge
norbye
had
found
that
this
was
the
thing
that
cinched
it
for
him,
that
the
interview
had
occurred
before
june
21.
he
couldn't
disbelieve
horgan.
and
that
--
now,
i
can't
now
tell
whether
that's
what
judge
norbye
found
or
whether
that's
just
an
inference
that
we
draw.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
thank
you
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
correct.
they
are
indicted.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
don't
think
so.
but
i
--
the
--
i'm
told
that
this
indictment
was
returned
two
days
after
the
cert
petition
was
granted.
that's
before
the
remand.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes,
in
the
--
well,
the
affidavits
were
before
you
at
the
time
you
granted
the
cert
petition,
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
but
they
weren't
--
you
had
--
there
were
some
affidavits
there,
was
it
not?
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
no
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
sauber
was
the
deputy
commissioner,
johnson
was
a
revenue
agent.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
thanks.
