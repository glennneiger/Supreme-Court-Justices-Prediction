were
all
these

receipts?

the
disbursements
for
black
markets
supplies
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
you
described
all
in
cash.
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
there
is
something
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
shotwell
reserved
the
right
to
contest
the
treasury
department
ruling
or
position
at
that
time?
justice
john

that
these
disbursements
that
were
not
deductible.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
that
right.

justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
saying
in
effect,
and
i
want
to
make
sure

you're
saying
in

the
former
solicitor
general
either
consciously
misrepresented
the
situation
in
the
--
justice

overreached
the

well,
what
is
your
point
then?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
relation
to
the
suppression
issue.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
record
show
why
sauber
insisted
on
the
figures
in
view
of
the
then
policy
of
the
department
that
these
figures
were
not
deductible?

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
that
before
the
case
that
was
decided
against
the
department?
justice
john
m.
harlan
ultimately,
it
was
held,
was
it
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
decision
came
after
this
episode,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
had
there
been
any
court
decisions
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
after
that
time?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
you
have
said,
the
only
finding
that
nordbye
made
on
the
first
suppression
hearing
is
that
the
disclosure
is
not
being
made
in
good
faith.
he
didn't

justice
john
m.
harlan

rule
on
timeliness
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
trial
record
already
showed
that,
that's
what
he
testified
to
at
the
trial,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
suppression.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
whole
issue
is
(inaudible)?
