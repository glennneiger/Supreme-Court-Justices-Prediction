what
did
judge
nordbye
said
about
the
disclosure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather
in
the
court's
opinion,
i've
just
been
reading
now
and
it's
also
brought
out
in
this
case.
it
was
rather
crucial
as
to
this
day
what
the
perjury
and
the
manner
indicates
that
it's
crucial
on
page
239
of
this
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
this
is
this
court's
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
this
court
has
acted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
has
acted
on
the
basis
graflund
swears
quite
differently
to
what
some
others
were
insisting
that
the
--
no
time
prior
to
a
meeting
held
in
july
1948
were
they
ever
advised
or
led
to
believe
by
respondents
to
shotwell's
black
market
receipts
had
been
disposed
to
the
treasury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
as
i
understand
it,
i
want
to
see
if
i'm
wrong,
at
that
very
time,
the
department
did
have
an
affidavit
from
graflund
showing
that
that
was
not
true.
am
i
right
in
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
these
affidavits
passed
has
paid
a
sharply
different
picture
of
the
entire
facts
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
court
is
explaining
why
turning
it
back.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
dissented
and
i
have
no
right
of
course.
justice
hugo
l.
black
indeed,
they
flatly
contradict
detail
and
unfold
it
on
behalf
of
respondents
in
the
district
court.
that
was
that
they
had
conferred
with
the
government
to
get
immunity
before
june
23rd.
but
this
court
as
the
basis
for
its
remand
said,
indeed
they
flatly
contradict
the
detail.
more
specifically,
graflund
swears
that
the
first
time
he
discuss
the
black
market
transaction,
was
at
busby's
home
in
late
june
1948.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
did
the
government
at
the
very
time
this
happened
--
we
relied
--
the
court
here
relied
on
that.
did
the
government
have
an
affidavit
from
graflund,
showing
that
busby
was
not
until
late
june
but
back
in
february?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
court's
opinion
states
graflund's
affidavit
on
which
we
acted
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
placed
it
at
a
different
date,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
although
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
government
had
an
affidavit
from
graflund
at
this
very
time
showing
that
graflund
was
now
admitting
that
the
thing
had
happened
in
april?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that,
however,
this
court
was
not
told
at
that
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
time
they
were
telling
the
truth
but
we
didn't
know
about
all
the
time
as
to
what
they'd
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
was
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
an
issue
before
the
original
jury
that
convicted
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
evidence,
the
--
as
to
the
finding
of
the
jury
on
the
evidence
then
they
hold.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
was
this
buttressed
and
the
hearing
before
judge
norbye
was
referenced
to
this
crucial
point
in
the
trial
of
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
new
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
new
evidence
to
prove
the
government's
side
of
that
issue,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
an
issue
in
the
original
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
was
relevant,
was
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
evidence
of
time
and
it
was
relevant,
was
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
--
one
of
the
crucial
issues
in
that
case
was
whether
they
had
decided
to
follow
the
government
by
this
alleged
report
of
that
limit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
judge
norbye
has
announced
--
strengthen
that,
has
he
not,
about
the
evidence
which
was
heard
a
part
which
he
says
is
based
on
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
of
which
he
has
now
found
either
to
be
grossly
exaggerated,
exonerated
of
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
before
the
petit
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
not
been
sup
--
disturbed
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
his
right
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
finding
is
the
same
but
how
do
we
know
it
would
have
been
the
same?
how
do
we
know
what
the
jury
would
have
found
in
the
original
trial
of
these
defendants
if
it
had
this
evidence
which
now
has
been
found
that
was
referenced
to
the
witnessed
used
against
them
where
judge
norbye
has
found
that
it's
exaggerated
or
grossly
exaggerated?
how
can
we
know
what
their
verdict
could've
been?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
my
--
my
question
is
based
on
the
fact
whether
it's
exaggerated
or
false,
whether
it
was
--
has
the
judge
found
peculiar
or
there's
nothing
wrong
about
it
on
that
witness'
part,
whether
he
just
testified
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
that
not
a
jury
question
which
should
have
been
sent
back
in
the
jury
to
the
trial
on
a
motion
on
the
new
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
my
--
that's
my
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
judge
norbye's
opinion
on
the
motion
for
new
trial
on
this
evidence
which
was
crucial
at
both
sides.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
unless
my
memory
is
wrong,
the
defense
put
up
by
the
defendant's
was
that
all
--
that
amount
was
crucial
to
them
because
they
claimed
that
they
had
spent
enough
on
black
market
contents
to
offset.
was
not
that
the
case
in
the
original
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury
was
it
not,
with
that
issue,
with
this
evidence
as
to
the
amount
that
had
been
spent,
the
government
now
brings
up
evidence
to
show
what
exaggerated
by
the
witness
so
that
the
jury
grant
--
the
petit
jury
did
not
get
the
advantage
of
that
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
my
problem
frankly
and
that
it
--
what
it
was
before.
who's
been
this
(voice
overlap)
on
trial
for
his
life
or
his
liberty
whether
the
amount
was
overwhelmingly
(inaudible)
--
to
this
extent
or
to
that
extent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
of
the
judge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
can
that
--
in
that
view,
(inaudible)
anymore
by
remanding
a
case
by
rehearing
by
a
trial
judge
that
it
could
in
the
original
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
a
new
trial.
i'm
talking
about
in
the
original
trial
before
the
jury
commands
that
people
are
convicted
on
one,
that
basis
of
issue
and
evidence
of
witnesses
said
to
be
truthful.
as
i
recall
it,
the
prosecuting
attorney
vouched
for
the
truthfulness
of
this
particular
witness.
that
being
the
case,
its
remanded
by
a
hearing
by
the
judge
to
see
whether
there
was
anything
wrong
then
he
finds
that
the
witness
is
supposedly
exa
--
or
exaggerated
it,
certain
other
facts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
witness
that
had
been
said
to
be
so
truthful.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
of
your
familiarity
with
the
record.
i
want
to
get
this
figured.
i
consider
this
case
very
important,
not
merely
for
these
defendants
here,
but
with
reference
to
the
right
of
trial
by
a
jury
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
provided
by
the
constitution.
who
were
the
chief
witnesses
against
the
defendants?
with
that
reach,
the
case
could
not
have
proceeded?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
lubben.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
was
mr.
lubben's
testimony
so
important?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
were
not
before
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
testified
and
his
evidence
was
essential,
was
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
gotten
along
with
that,
as
i
recall
it,
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
told
the
jury
that
he
vowed
for
his
integrity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
one
of
the
objections
they
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
mr.
lubben
is
the
man
whose
evidence
was
sought
to
be
supported
by
these
affidavits,
was
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
importance
of
his
testimony
was
that
he
could
testify,
they
had
turned
in
--
they
had
failed
to
turn
in
a
lot
of
payments
that
he
had
made
them
on
the
black
market.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
it
went
back,
for
some
reason,
judge
norbye
found
it
necessary
to
go
into
great
detail
to
find
that
while
he
had
misstated
the
evidence
or
had
not
directly
stated
the
evidence,
or
had
exaggerated
it,
or
whatever
you
please,
that
he
found
he
was
not
guilty
of
deliberate
perjury
but
had
merely
misstated
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
suppose
that
evidence
had
been
presented
to
the
jury,
petit
jury,
would
that
have
been
revelant
--
relevant
to
attack
the
credibility
of
mr.
lubben?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
have
been
developed
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
they
didn't
have
it,
and
they
didn't
get
it
until
finally
the
government
brought
it
out
on
this
motion
for
rehearing,
motion
for
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
remand.
so
that
you
have
a
case
where
relevant
evidence,
relevant,
exceedingly
relevant
to
the
defendants,
is
not
submitted
to
the
jury
to
support
its
verdict
but
submitted
to
the
judge
by
piecemeal
to
support
its
verdict,
to
support
the
government's
case,
is
that
not
true?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
suppose
it's
not
of
the
--
let's
suppose
its
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
you
have
a
case
that
the
government
is
getting
its
verdict
to
stick
on
evidence
which
have
been
--
which
had
it
been
offered
by
the
defendant
would
likely
have
given
him
a
right
for
a
new
trial
before
a
jury
with
all
that
evidence
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
not
correct?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
that
would
--
it
would
--
then
you're
saying
that
it's
not
strong
enough
to
give
a
new
trial
but
it
is
strong
enough
to
let
the
government
keep
a
verdict
that
was
obtained
by
evidence
now
found
to
be
wrong
and
by
witness
who
could've
been
at
least
considerably
impeached
by
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
judge's
finding
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
where
were
their
admission?
what
did
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they
admit?
how
much
did
they
admit
they
receive
on
the
stand?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
they
refused,
they
attacked
these
figures
and
said
they
were
given
to
them
by
lubben
and
they
didn't
know
whether
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
correct
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
claimed
did
they
not
that
they
had
stamped
of
black
market
commodities
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
an
amount
equal
to
that
$150,000
which
they
extented.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
why
--
that
was
the
real
crucial
issue,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
the
jury
had
to
rely
on
evidence
of
lubben
or
evidence
he
had
supplied
to
them
and
put
in
this
--
put
in
here
in
order
to
reach
a
conclusion
as
to
whether
that
defense
was
good
or
bad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
was
a
very
material
witness.
justice
hugo

was
that
evidence
have
been
admissible
to
impeach
lubben's
credibility
--
justice

before
the
