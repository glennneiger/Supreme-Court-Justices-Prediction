i
wanted

did

that

(inaudible)

450?

well
do
you
have
this
--
i
forgotten
whether
the
affidavits
or
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
before
arguing
to
--
the
same
that
you
were
arguing
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
one
told
you
about
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
affidavit
that
he
handed
to
you
was
he
had
not
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
on
that
affidavit
that
he
actually
decided
to
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
time
he
filed
the
affidavit,
when
did
you
finally
--
in
relation
to
this
time,
he
decided
that
has
been
remanded,
when
did
he
tell
you
he
doesn't
know,
“i
was
wrong”
and
i
said
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
the
trial
is
it
the
government's
contention
that
the
disclosure
that
one
is
made
and
not
made
entirely
of
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
the
hearing.
i'm
speaking
of
what
the
theory
had
been.
what
was
he
doing
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
lack
of
exposure.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
the
jury
i
gather
with
mr.
christensen
an
issue
of
this
disclosure
to
accredit
his
claim
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
was
in
the
evidence
is
the
date
of
disclosure
of
sauber?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
he
was
reiterating
was
the
various
statements
of
a
january
or
some
other
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
he
can't
go
out
with
a
story
that
did
not
happened
in
june
now
what
you're
telling
us
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he
never
changed
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
even
when
he
got
back
before
judge
nordbye.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
judge
nordbye
made
his
finding
that
he
was
in
error
on
the
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
did
say
it
to
judge
nordbye.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sworn
to
judge
nordbye
that
that
was
in
june.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
judge
nordbye
nevertheless
concluded
that
he
was
quite
mistaken.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
as
through
a
jury.
well
mr.
oberdorfer
in
that
connection,
this
type
that
we
were
discussing
with
mr.
christensen
and
mr.
howard
was
the
other
day
maybe
with
both
of
this
appendix
d
at
page
85
of
the
petition,
was
that,
you
know,
was
that
an
evidence
before
the
petit
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
noticed
at
the
bottom
of
that,
my
arithmetic's
any
good,
this
indicates
receipts
of
roughly
around
$368,000
collection.
by
whom
was
that
offered,
by
the
government
or
by
the
defendants?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
where
did
the
government
get
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
whom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
whom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
behalf
of
shotwell.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
in
that
sense,
in
--
an
admission
was
it?
was
it
offered
as
an
admission
by
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
i
gather
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
how
far
at
the
trial
did
lubben's
testimony
as
to
the
amount
that
he
paid,
shotwell
exceed
or
was
it
less
than
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
total?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
we're
still
talking
about
the
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
was
his
total
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
does
exceed
shotwell's
own
admission
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
what
it
received,
by
roughly
what?
not
--
by
the
hundred
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
gather
your
position
is
that
without
lubben's
testimony,
their
own
admission
showed
what
the
expense
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unrecorded
income
of
around
$368,000.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
i
gather
mr.
oberdorfer
from
the
government's
position
is
that,
as
far
as
you
know,
the
petit
jury
may
completely
have
disbelieved
lubben
and
have
accepted
their
own
admission
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
on
the
strength
of
that
had
made
a
finding
of
guilt
because
by
their
own
admissions
there
had
been
these
various
substantial
amounts
around
the
corner.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
was
a
general
verdict
that
they
put.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
not
a
$163,000
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
christensen.
do
i
understand
all
of
four
sheets
were
in
evidence,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
first
(voice
overlap),
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
tell
me
mr.
christensen,
wasn't
the
issue
of
lubben's
credibility
before
the
jury
in
face
of
his
testimony,
whether
from
the
books
or
(inaudible)
or
both
of
$450,000,
these
papers
constructing,
reconstructing
$368,000
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
testimony
the
defendants
themselves
that
know
--
was
only
a
$150,000.
now,
did
that
confront
the
jury
with
an
issue
of
lubben's
credibility.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
on
the
first
suppression
hearing,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
the
position
taken
at
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
a
testimony
on
the
government
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
have
at
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
(inaudible)
on
the
way
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
was
the
position
at
the
trial
itself?
