mr.
william
t.
kirby
i
speak
for
the
petitioner,
harold
sullivan
who
is
a
lawyer
in
chicago
and
during
all
the
years,
the
question
was
engaged
in
a
substantial
law
practice
and
acting
as
a
master
in
chancery.
now,
he
--
the
proof
is
very
plain
that
harold
sullivan,
the
petitioner,
did
not
prepare
the
tax
returns
in
question
and
did
not
see
that.
indeed,
he
became
a
vice-president
of
the
company
only
after
the
return
which
is
count
1
of
the
indictment
was
filed.
now
when
--
mr.
william
t.
kirby
no
sir.
it's
0.5
of
the
general
brief.
when
this
case
was
here
before,
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
case
was
now
going
to
be
sent
back
for
a
limited
area
of
inquiry
and
that
the
merits
of
the
first
verdict
with
respect
to
any
of
the
petitioners
were
not
being
reached.
and
this
court
said
at
that
time,
that
verdict
clearly
must
stand
or
fall
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
already
introduced
on
the
trial.
and
it
pointed
out
that
no
questions
of
substances
of
the
petitioners
not
yet
been
reached
but
could
be
reached
and
it's
those
points
with
respect
to
harold
sullivan
that
i
address
myself.
mr.
william
t.
kirby
i
address
myself
with
respect
to
harold
sullivan
on
two
points
as
to
the
merits
of
the
trial.
our
subsection
5
of
the
general
brief
has
captured
that
sullivan
did
not
have
a
fair
trial.
suppression
question
has
basically
been
treated
by
mr.
christensen.
my
point
on
the
suppression
issue
is
very
simple.
you
did
not
want
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
these
documents
were
constitutionally
inhibited
until
you
got
to
the
question
of
whether
the
documents
came
in
as
a
part
of
a
disclosure.
it
went
back
down
to
judge
nordbye
and
judge
nordbye
said,
“yes,
these
documents
came
in
as
a
part
of
the
disclosure
and
indeed
they
say
it
was
used
in
the
disclosure
recap.”
it's
what
he
found
but
he
said,
“i'm
not
satisfied
with
the
truth
of
it.”
but
of
course
in
rogers
versus
richmond,
you
decided
that
truth
or
falsity
does
not
decide
the
question
of
constitutional
permissive
use.
but
that's
another
question.
they
think
constitutionally,
these
documents
cannot
be
used.
that's
in
the
other
portion
of
the
brief.
but
with
respect
to
harold
sullivan,
the
only
truth
about
harold
sullivan,
the
trial
is
exceedingly
limited.
this
was
a
trial
four
defendants
that
lasted
several
weeks
with
75
witnesses
but
when
it
was
over,
judge
nordbye
asked
--
he
reserved
the
question
of
the
motion
of
acquittal
for
sullivan
and
he
pondered
that
six
weeks
after
the
jury
trial.
he
asked
for
briefs
and
he
only
asked
for
small
portions
of
the
testimony
of
two
witnesses
to
be
written
up
out
of
the
75.
and
the
only
testimony
that
runs
through
judge
nordbye's
whole
opinion
denying
the
acquittal
of
sullivan
is
that
this
man
lubben
said
that
he
had
gone
to
sullivan's
office
on
february
14,
1946
and
he
tendered
some
checks
and
sullivan
said,
“i
don't
want
checks,
we
want
cash.”
and
as
lubben
so
testified,
he
produced
check
forms
dated
february
14,
1946
but
with
the
names
of
the
payees'
cut
out.
that's
to
prove
his
case.
now,
that's
all
there
is
about
sullivan.
accordingly,
when
you
go
to
judge
nordbye's
careful
written
opinion,
that's
all
there
is.
now,
i
point
out
that
the
next
morning,
lubben
took
the
stand
and
referring
to
divine
guidance
recanted,
said
he
wasn't
there
in
february,
it
was
in
the
fall.
well,
in
the
fall?
he
could
have
been
there
about
february
14
checks
and
this
poisonous
point,
“he
didn't
want
checks,
he
want
cash”
couldn't
have
occurred
in
the
fall.
now,
this
court,
therefore
have
this
to
sullivan
an
instance
where
the
whole
case
as
to
sullivan
is
upon
an
alleged
extrajudicial
admission
uncorroborated
therefore
the
corpus
delicti
cannot
be
established
with
the
u.s.
versus
smith
and
u.s.
versus
collin.
but
not
only
is
this
an
extrajudicial
admission
which
is
uncorroborated.
it's
recanted
the
very
next
morning
and
i
say
with
all
respect
that
as
you
said
that
verdict
must
stand
or
fall
on
the
evidence
that
was
in
then,
as
to
sullivan,
it
must
fall.
mr.
william
t.
kirby
the
mechanics
of
the
recanting
were,
he
said,
i
had
“a
conversation”
in
the
fall.
he
never
gave
the
context
or
the
text
of
it
so
i
say
that
it's
a
recantation
in
full.
at
least
it
is
no
corroborated
extrajudicial
admission
of
that
substance
that
is
needed
to
supply
that
one
thing
to
hold
mr.
sullivan.
now,
at
the
very
least,
further,
and
as
an
additional
point
with
respect
to
sullivan,
this
case
presented
a
problem
which
is
often
occupied
the
attention
of
this
in
other
courts
where
you
have
a
number
of
man
in
a
long
complicated
trial
in
evidences
admissible
against
some
but
not
others.
and
then
the
question
is,
has
the
one
against
to
whom
the
evidence
was
not
admitted
can
protect
so
that
his
faith
is
not
decided
by
evidence
which
is
not
admitted
or
admissible
against
him.
judges
learned
hand
and
jerome
frank
and
a
number
of
the
justices
of
this
court
have
taken
the
view
that
where
the
evidence
is
vital
and
dramatic,
it
is
impossible
for
the
jury
to
perform
the
mental
gymnastics
of
just
simply
striking
it
from
their
mind.
and
some
fine
opinions
have
been
written
where
it
is
said
that
where
you
have
that
vital
evidence,
it
just
will
be
transferred
inevitably.
but
in
any
event,
this
court
has
in
two
cases
where
the
court
gave
very
strong
restrictive
instruction
that
the
evidence
should
not
be
transferred
over
to
the
person
against
whom
that
was
not
admitted.
in
two
cases,
this
court
is
permitted
the
conviction
to
stand,
those
being
blumenthal
and
delli
paoli.
that
even
in
delli
paoli,
there
was
a
very
strong
dissent
by
justice
frankfurter
for
himself
and
justices
black,
douglas
and
brennan
which
said
that
psychologically
it
was
impossible
for
the
jury
not
to
consider
that
strong
dramatic
evidence
against
the
other
petitioner.
now,
in
this
case
involved
and
in
two
cases
where
the
judge
didn't
make
that
impregnable
barrier,
convictions
were
reversed.
those
two
being
anderson
and
kotteakos.
now,
in
this
case,
most
of
the
evidence
was
never
admitted,
much
of
it
was
never
even
offered
against
sullivan
but
when
it
came
time
to
instruct
the
jury,
the
judge
affirmatively
directed
them
to
consider
that
evidence
against
sullivan.
there
was
an
affirmative
misdirection
not
a
mere
equivocation.
for
instance,
lubben
testified
about
many
conversations
out
of
the
presence
of
sullivan
and
cain
and
they
were
highly
dramatic
with
money
piled
up
by
motel
beds.
they
were
not
admitted
against
sullivan
but
in
the
instructions,
the
jury
was
told
to
consider
them
against
sullivan.
the
claimed
oral
admissions
of
cain
where
he
was
asked
many,
many
questions
about
how
he
made
up
some
figures,
they
were
not
offered
against
sullivan,
they
were
not
admitted
against
sullivan
but
in
the
charge
of
the
jury,
the
judge
very
vividly
recall
them
and
told
the
jury
to
consider
them
against
sullivan.
now,
the
documents
--
mr.
william
t.
kirby
yes,
indeed
over
objection
and
the
good
judge
said
to
me
when
i
made
the
objection,
he
said,
“didn't
i
tell
the
jury
that
when
the
documents
were
admitted
that
they
weren't
to
be
considered?”
i
said,
“yes,
your
honor
but
you
are
now
telling
them
just
the
opposite.”
with
all
respect
in
the
world,
he
told
me
to
hurry
on.
mr.
william
t.
kirby
yes,
he
did.
mr.
william
t.
kirby
that's
exactly
true.
it's
exactly
what
he
said.
however,
where
you
have
an
abstract
to
destruction,
and
that
abstract
to
destruction
generally
something
that
occurs
out
of
the
presence
of
the
defendant
is
not
admissible
against
him.
but
then
as
the
judge,
you
recite
details
of
evidence
and
important
evidence,
indeed
the
so-called
exhibit
185
series,
the
government
time
after
time
has
said
it's
one
of
the
two
legs
upon
which
the
conviction
stand.
those
were
not
even
admitted
against
sullivan
or
offered
against
him
and
judge
nordbye
described
them
in
particular
and
he
said
those
could
be
used
to
determine
the
intent
of
sullivan
to
violate
the
tax
law.
and
in
kotteakos,
it
was
pointed
out
that
if
you
have
an
equivocal
and
unilluminating
instruction
but
then
you
have
misdirection,
then
this
risk
that
this
evidence
will
be
transferred
over
against
the
defendant
is
surely
there.
mr.
william
t.
kirby
i
--
this
was
not
a
conspiracy
case.
the
government
in
a
footnote
says
that
in
a
conspiracy
case,
they
might
have
been
able
to
put
it
in
a
conspiracy
case.
but
i
don't
think
sir
that
we
can
--
i
don't
think
that
we
can
say
that
much
of
this
evidence
under
any
circumstances
would
have
been
admissible
against
sullivan.
from
a
deep
familiarity
of
the
record,
i
assure
you
especially
some
of
the
most
crucial
evidence
which
they
didn't
even
proffer
against
sullivan.
so
we
have
here
a
case
of
affirmative
misdirection
which
certainly
produced
equivocation.
the
government
and
the
court
below
said,
well,
we
gave
one
good
instruction
and
that
should
satisfy
it.
gentlemen,
it
satisfies
none
of
the
tests
of
the
leading
cases
and
i
humbly
submit
that
at
least
as
to
sullivan
there
must
be
a
reversal.
thank
you.
