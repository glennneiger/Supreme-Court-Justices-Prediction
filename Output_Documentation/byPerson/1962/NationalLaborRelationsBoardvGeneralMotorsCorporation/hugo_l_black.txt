what?
justice

what
do
you
mean
by
far
more
onerous?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
were
accorded
that
same
privilege
and
benefits,
would
you
still
object?
justice

and
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
that
the
great
relevance
here
--

--
other
arguments
you're
making.

but
if
they
were
to
get
precisely
the
same
service
thinking
of
it
as
a
service
agreement
as
though
the
secretary
of
labor
for
instance
has
been
designated
to
form
the
bargaining
service.if
they
were
to
get
precisely
the
same
service,
you
would
still
have
the
objection
that
this
was
unlawful.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
not
a
constitutional
objection
you're
making.

it
does
not
raise
the
question
of
whether
the
government
--
congress
would
have
the
power
to
require
a
worker
to
contribute
actual
cost,
pay
the
services
for
collective
bargaining
agent
selected
by
the
government.
justice

will
your
pleadings
or
the
issues
you
have
raised
bring
before,
decipher
the
question
whether
these
people
are
being
or
would
be
required
to
pay
for
services
that
are
not
rendered
by
a
collective
bargaining
agent.
