mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
my
name
is
harry
s.
benjamin,
i
represent
the
respondent
in
this
matter,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
i
think
that
i
am
in
substantial
agreement
with
the
solicitor
general's
statement
of
the
facts.
i
think
that
if
i
understand
his
presentation
as
to
what
the
issue
is,
we
both
see
the
issue
as
the
same.
now,
two
painters
with
common
colors
and
a
common
subject
can
think
two
pictures
which
will
have
various
reactions
by
various
people
so
too
to
lawyers
with
a
common
set
of
facts
and
a
common
issue
can
present
two
pictures
which
will
give
varying
interpretations
depending
on
where
one
sits.
in
this
particular
case,
i
believe
the
solicitor
general
with
rather
broad
strokes
has
presented
the
picture
within
a
rather
large
framework.
this
picture
to
us
has
been
out
of
focus.
we
believe
that
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
and
the
question
presented
here
and
in
agreement
with
the
solicitor,
there
is
a
narrow
issue.
and
so
i
would
like
at
the
outset,
if
i
may,
within
the
narrow
framework
against
which
we
ask
the
court
to
view
our
position
very
briefly
state
our
position.
in
this
particular
matter,
a
proposal
was
made
to
general
motors
to
enter
into
an
agreement
which
would
condition
the
continuance
of
a
man's
job
upon
his
payment
to
a
labor
organization
of
a
fee.
the
fee
in
this
particular
case
happening
to
be
equivalent
to
the
membership
dues
and
initiation
fees
which
would
be
charged
to
members
of
the
union
who
might
otherwise
be
covered
by
a
union
shop
agreement.
from
the
outset,
we
took
the
position
with
respect
to
that
proposal
that
it
was
invalid;
it
was
in
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended.
our
position
was
that
it
violated
the
federal
law.
now,
let
me
turn
very
quickly
to
the
provisions
of
the
act
which
we
believe
invalidated
the
proposal.
frankly,
i
listen
very
attentively
to
hear
the
solicitor
general
make
reference
to
one
section
of
the
statute
which
we
believe
is
the
lifeblood
of
this
whole
problem,
namely,
section
7,
but
i
did
not
hear
reference
to
that
section.
section
7
spells
out
the
rights
of
individuals.
that
section
says
that
an
employee
may
have
the
right
to
join,
to
assist,
to
form,
and
otherwise
carry
on
legitimate
labor
organization
activities.
in
1947,
congress
saw
fit
to
amend
that
section,
to
provide
that
employees
might
refrain
from
joining,
assisting,
or
contributing
to
labor
organizations.
at
the
end
of
the
amendment
to
that
section,
it
inserted
these
words
after
indicating
that
an
individual
might
refrain
from
joining,
assisting,
and
so
forth
except
to
the
extent
that
such
right
may
be
affected
by
an
agreement
requiring
membership
in
a
labor
organization
as
a
condition
of
employment
as
authorized
in
section
8
(a)
(3).
now,
if
i
understand
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
he
believes
that
section
8
(a)
(3)
confers
certain
rights
and
authorizes
certain
types
of
agreements
but
section
8
(a)
(3)
is
written
in
the
terms
of
limitation.
the
rights
insofar
as
those
of
individuals
are
concerned,
are
set
forth
in
section
7.
every
employee
has
the
right
absolutely
to
refrain
from
joining,
assisting,
or
contribute
--
contributing
to
a
labor
organization
except,
except
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
agreement
that
might
be
entered
into
under
section
8
(a)
(3)
which,
by
the
terms
of
the
statute,
might
be
authorized.
now,
the
only
agreement
that
is
authorized
under
section
8
(a)
(3)
and
the
only
agreement
which
will
provide
some
shield
for
an
employer
being
charged
with
an
unfair
labor
practice
if
he
should
attempt
to
make
an
employee
pay
some
money
to
a
labor
organization
is
one
which
requires
membership
where
the
statute
clearly
says
that
nothing
in
this
act
shall
preclude
an
employer
from
making
an
agreement
with
the
labor
organization
to
require
as
a
condition
of
employment,
membership
therein,
and
then
there
are
other
words
which
are
not
relevant
to
the
issue
here
presented.
now,
membership
and
the
word
--
membership
has
no
unusual
meaning.
when
congress
amended
the
statute,
it
did
not
deem
it
necessary
to
put
in
a
specific
definition
of
membership
in
that
section
of
the
statute
which
sets
forth
definitions.
membership
simply
means
the
status
which
one
acquires
by
having
a
desire
to
become
associated
with
an
organization
in
having
been
admitted
to
that
organization
after
fulfilling
whatever
requirements
and
obligations
the
organization
may
impose.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
record
is
clear
that
there
are
a
number
of
employees
and
it
so
stipulated
on
the
record.
there
are
a
number
of
employees
who
have
no
desire
whatsoever
to
be
bound
by
the
agency
shop
arrangement,
to
make
any
contributions
to
the
union.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
is
also
clear
in
this
particular
case
that
those
employees
who
might
be
obligated
to
make
the
contributions
which
this
arrangement
would
require
would
not
even
receive
the
same
treatment
as
those
employees
who
were
members.
for
example
--
for
example,
the
record
is
clear
that
those
employees
who
would
be
covered
by
the
agency
shop
would
never
have
the
opportunity
to
vote
on
whether
they
wanted
this
arrangement.
the
record
is
also
clear
that
they
would
not
have
the
right
or
privilege
to
attend
union
meetings.
they
would
not
have
the
right
of
privilege
to
vote
on
certain
matters
with
respect
to
the
disposition
of
certain
union
funds.
the
record
is
clear
that
they
could
not
even
receive
the
union
newspaper
which
was
the
document
or
means
by
which
people
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
were
advised
as
to
what
was
taking
place
between
the
employer
and
the
employee.
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
i
believe
the
record
would
indicate
that
they
could,
but
the
point
is,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
the
statute
does
not
require
them
to
exercise
any
such
option.
section
7
says
that
they
have
the
absolute
right
to
refrain
from
joining,
assisting,
or
becoming
a
member
of
the
union
except
as
an
agreement
having
membership
as
its
basis
may
require,
and
there's
no
question
here
that
the
solicitor
general
does
not,
i'm
sure,
contend.
in
fact,
they
wouldn't
be
making
the
proposal.
he
does
not
contend
that
membership
is
--
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
i
did
not
hear
the
first
part
of
your
question.
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
we
disagree
with
that.
we
say
that
the
record
does
not
support
that
statement
and
i
respectfully
direct
--
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
no,
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
well,
this
appears
on
page
61
is
in
the
board
so-called
supplemental
decision
and
order.
now,
it's
interesting
to
me
that
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
when
the
board
--
when
the
board
handed
down
its
supplemental
decision
and
order,
it
vacated
every
finding
of
fact
and
every
conclusion
apparently
that
appears
in
the
original
decision
which
upheld
our
position
and
the
only
things
that
it
carried
over
into
this
supplemental
decision
were
the
findings
that
has
been
made
as
to
the
respondent's
business
and
the
fact
that
the
union
was
a
labor
organization.
this
is
--
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
woodcock
testified
in
part
to
that
fact
but
let
--
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
there
is
some
statements
made
by
woodcock
which
might
prompt
such
a
statement
but
i
respectfully
direct
your
attention
to
page
90
of
the
record
wherein
i
--
in
examining
mr.
woodcock
said,
“i
think
you
have
already
indicated,
have
you
not,
just
so
it
is
clear
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
union's
constitution
who
are
nonmembers
to
vote
with
respect
to
the
ratification
of
any
agreement
that
may
have
been
negotiated
on
behalf
of
the
employees
you
represent
in
terms
of
membership
ratification.”
“no.”
then
i
said
to
him,
“well,
is
there
anything
in
the
union's
constitution
which
specifically
spells
out
or
protects
the
right
of
nonmembers
who
are
represented
exclusively
by
the
union
pursuant
to
a
live
certification
issued
by
the
nlrb?”
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
and
he
said,
“no.”
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
he
did
say
that,
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
i
can't
say
that
on
the
basis
of
the
record
but
i
say
that
the
conclusion
that
he
draw
--
drew
and
answers
the
question
that
was
put
to
him,
does
not
appear
to
be
supported
in
the
record.
i
say
that
his
responses
to
other
questions
indicate
it
clearly
that
they
did
not
receive
some
of
those
benefits
and
privileges
that
members
would
receive
and
did
receive.
it's
just
as
a
small
item.
he
indicated,
for
example,
that
in
his
testimony
that
the
nonmembers
would
receive
the
union
newspaper,
but
the
constitution
specifically
said
that
on
--
that
nonmembers
could
only
receive
it
upon
paying
an
additional
fee
and
when
supplement
was
called
to
his
attention,
he
said,
“yes,
that
is
correct.”
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
in
my
--
yes.
and
you
can
make
the
point
very
well
because
of
the
argument
that
it
is
a
lesser
form.
it
is
not
a
lesser
form.
under
the
circumstances
here
and
as
this
record
reveals,
in
our
view,
this
is
far
more
onerous.
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
it
--
in
that
the
nonmembers
covered
by
the
agency
shop
would
have
to
pay
the
same
amount
that
members
had
to
pay
but
in
return
they
would
not
have
the
same
privilege
and
benefits.
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
i
would
still
object
on
the
grounds
that
the
contract
still
does
not
require
--
is
not
based
upon
membership,
that
the
agency
shop,
the
proposal
here
is
not
one
within
the
terms
of
the
contract,
within
terms
of
the
statute
because
it
is
not
based
on
membership.
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
well
--
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
it's
only
in
answer
to
the
argument
that
was
made
in
the
brief
that
the
agency
shop
is
something
less
--
is
a
lesser
form
of
union
security.
i
say
that's
not
a
lesser
form
of
union
security
because
number
one,
it
is
not
based
on
membership
but
number
two,
if
you
look
at
lesser
in
the
terms
of
burdensome,
it
is
more
burdensome
because
here
the
individuals
would
have
to
pay
the
same
amount
that
a
member
would
have
to
pay
but
would
not
get
the
same
benefit,
so
in
effect,
they
are
subsidizing
the
members
rather
than
the
other
way
around.
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
we
still
have
the
objection
that
it
is
unlawful
because
one
is
a
question
whether
it's
based
on
membership,
the
other
goes
to
question
of
treatment
whether
it's
discriminatory
because
of
treatment.
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
plus
the
fact
that
he
has
the
protection
of
the
statute
which
it
didn't
require
him
to
come.
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
no,
there
is
no
constitutional
question
raised
in
this
case.
there
has
not
been
a
constitutional
question
raised
here.
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
i
would
have
to
answer
that
question,
your
honor,
that
it
might
form
the
basis
for
some
constitutional
argument
that
as
the
pleadings
refrained
here
and
as
the
case
was
tried,
that
was
not
argued
and
was
not
presented.
now,
the
solicitor
general
has
indicated
by
reference
to
pages
101
of
the
record
and
particularly
the
term
what
is
collective
bargaining
agreement,
if
i
understood
his
argument
correctly,
that
all
one
has
to
do
is
pay
membership
dues
and
initiation
fees
and
he
thereby
becomes
a
member
under
this
particular
arrangement
which
we
had
with
uaw
and
therefore,
in
effect,
it's
no
different
from
the
agency
shop.
well,
if
you
read
section
4
(a)
which
the
solicitor
general
referred,
the
language
there
is
in
dual
terms.
it
talks
about
becoming
a
member
of
the
union,
the
employee
who
is
not
a
member
of
the
union
shall
become
a
member
of
the
union
and
shall
remain
a
member
by
paying
dues
and
so
forth.now,
the
mere
fact
that
he
pays
his
dues
does
not
make
him
a
member
because
if
you
respectfully
will
turn
to
page
105,
section
3
of
the
union's
constitution
there
states
under
section
3,
upon
acceptance
of
the
application
of
membership
shall
be.
so
that
there
are
two
things
involved
even
under
the
--
under
the
existing
agreement
and
that
is
that
one
must
make
an
application
for
a
membership,
a
desire
to
become
and
then
maintain
his
membership
to
the
extent
of
paying
his
dues.
mr.
harry
s.
benjamin,
jr.
no,
they
do
not,
mr.
justice.
the
solicitor
general
had
also
indicated
that
the
proposal
which
was
made
to
the
company
was
in
rather
general
terms
and
therefore
is
not
easy
to
argue
that
it
was
illegal
under
the
statute.
i
submit
that
the
record
clearly
indicates
that
in
the
original
proposal
made
to
the
union,
they
spelled
out
in
great
detail
that
they
want
--
that
they
wanted
to
condition
the
continued
membership
of
nonmembers
of
the
union
solely
upon
the
payment
of
a
fee.
it
did
--
it
so
happened
that
it
was
the
equivalent
of
membership
dues
and
initiation
fees,
but
that
the
proposal
was
never
intended
that
it'd
be
any
broader
than
that.
and
the
record
so
--
makes
that
absolutely
clear,
because
counsel
for
the
union
stated
in
the
record,
if
i
may
be
permitted,
he
said
to
the
trial
examiner,
“i
would
suggest
that
neither
you
nor
the
board
ought
to
infer
from
the
terms
used
by
the
witness,
the
idea
that
any
other
proposal
than
that
embodied
in
the
letter
is
in
his
mind.
and
then
again
on
page
93,
the
counsel
for
the
union
again
states,
“our
proposal
embodies
every
essential
subsident
element
of
an
agency
shop
agreement”.
our
position
is
a
very
simple
one.
we
say
that
the
statute
must
be
construed
literally
to
say
that
section
7
does
not
require
a
person
to
become
associated
with
the
union
to
make
contributions
to
it
or
to
assist
the
labor
organization
except
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
agreement
requiring
membership.
the
proposal
here
on
its
face
does
not
require
membership
and
therefore,
the
proposal
as
far
as
any
protection
under
the
statute
finds
no
support.
now,
the
solicitor
general
makes
some
argument
with
respect
to
the
provisos
to
section
8
(a)
(3),
but
those
provisos
never
come
into
play.
they
deal
with
agreements
and
discharge
of
employees
for
their
failure
to
pay
their
membership
dues
or
initiation
fees.
those
provisions
of
section
8
--
the
two
provisos
of
section
8
(a)
(3)
never
come
into
play
in
this
case
because
there
is
no
agreement,
there
is
no
agreement
which
would
be
in
existence
that
continued
--
conditions
continued
membership
upon
conditions
--
continued
employment
upon
membership
in
the
labor
organization.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
construed
the
statute
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
when
it
said
the
language
is
unambiguous.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
acted
when
they
said
that
they
would
not
rewrite
the
law
and
neither
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
expressed
themselves
when
they
said
that
if
the
statute
is
to
be
construed
as
the
national
labor
relations
board
contends
that
is
for
congress
to
decide.
