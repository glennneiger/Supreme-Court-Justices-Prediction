it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
it
requires
all
the
burdens
of
membership
if
it
confers
not
all
the
benefits
of
membership.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
--
i
still
don't
think
get
your
answer.
in
other
words,
you're
saying
this
is
the
same
as
membership.
justice
potter
stewart
i
still
have
a
little
philosophical
difficulty
in
understanding
this
--
understanding
why
you
say
that
an
agency
shop
is
so
much
more
of
power
than
much
more
liberal
--
liberal
with
respect
to
an
individual
employee,
the
employee
has
to
pay
exactly
the
same
initiation
fee
and
dues
as
a
member,
general.
and
then,
it's
up
to
him
whether
or
not
he
wants
to
get
anything
for
that
money,
but
that
fee
--
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
a
member
doesn't
have
to
go
to
meetings,
and
he
doesn't
have
to
have
his
fellow
union
members
to
his
house
for
dinner.
this
is
a
--
but
he
does
get
the
union
newspaper
and
that's
it.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
hurt
your
argument
at
all
to
say
they're
exactly
the
same
thing.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you
win
your
case.
justice
potter
stewart
it
suggests
that
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
was
wrong,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
of
major
contemporary
significance
as
union
preference
clause?
i
asked
you
because
i've
never
heard
of
it
frankly.
justice
potter
stewart
with
that
preference,
a
union
preference
clause
would
be
illegal
under
the
present
law,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
for
both
discriminating
and
hiring
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
what
senator
taft
was
saying
in
effect
was
we've
set
up
in
the
statute
an
agency
shop
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
a
union
shop.
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
record
clear,
mr.
benjamin
that
--
that
if
they
want
to
they
can
become
members
of
the
union
and
then
get
all
of
these
things
too
as
many
of
them
as
they
choose
to
do?
justice
potter
stewart
the
point
is
that
if
a
person
who
wants
to
join
a
union,
he
pays
this
money
and
gets
the
benefits
of
union
--
union
membership
but
a
person
who
doesn't
want
to
but
has
all
the
burdens
and
all
the
benefits.
it's
like
if
you
have
a
dollar
and
you
want
to
go
to
a
movie,
you
get
--
you
go,
you
see
the
movie
for
a
dollar
and
that's
a
lot
different
from
somebody
who's
taking
dollar
from
you
and
give
you
nothing.
justice
potter
stewart
if
he
doesn't
want
to
see
the
movie,
he
is
worse
off.
justice
potter
stewart
well
