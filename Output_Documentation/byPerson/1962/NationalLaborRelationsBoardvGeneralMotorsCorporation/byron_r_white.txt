justice
byron

well,
on
the
case
of
pension
funds,
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
have
to
become
a
member
as
well
as
pay
these
equivalent
sums?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
saying
under
14
(b)
your
position
indeed
is
the
--
the
act
which
permits
the
state
to
regulate
anything
--
any
type
of
union
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
three
or
four
examples
that
you
gave
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
short
of
union
shop.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
have
one
question.
an
agency
shop
or
some
form
of
union
security
along
this
which
would
be
normally
protected
by
8
(a)
(3)
but
it
is
then
by
state
law
which
you
say
the
state
is
free
to
ban
section
14,
does
the
package
then
become
--
that
remains
in
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
the
government
take
any
position
at
this
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
nor
whether
or
not
the
board
feels
that
it
is
the
one
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
state
law
does
or
does
not
stand.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
the
absence
of
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
disputing
the
--
you
really
don't
agree
with
the
board
in
this
case,
dispute
whether
or
not
nonmembers
would
be
deprived
of
particular
rights.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
while
ago
you
said
--
you
said
that
if
--
that
these
employees
would
be
deprive
the
rights
of
his
members
ordinarily
would
enjoy.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
significance
of
this
statement
that's
here
on
page
61
of
the
--
of
the
record,
in
the
footnote
--
footnote
12.
you
said
there's
no
basis
for
the
position
derived
from
the
testimony
of
woodcock
that
nonmember
employer
--
employees
required
to
pay
these
local
union
dues
would
be
deprived
for
certain
benefits.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
the
finding
of
the
board,
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
this
--
what
is
this
here
on
page
61?
justice
byron
r.
white
woodcock
did
so
testify,
didn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
at
least
there
is
this
much
basis
for
the
statement
namely,
woodcock's
testimony.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
no
difference
in
the
footnote
on
61
really.
he
admitted

he
admits
that
the
constitution
indicates
to
the
matter
of
union
practice
that
nonmembers
are

are
extended
with
the
normal
rights
of
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
say
that's
wrong
as
a
matter
of
fact?
justice
byron
