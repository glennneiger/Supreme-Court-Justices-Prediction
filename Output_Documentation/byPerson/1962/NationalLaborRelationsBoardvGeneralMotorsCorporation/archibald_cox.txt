mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
labor
board
case
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
whether
an
employer
and
a
labor
union
representing
its
employees
may
without
violating
the
national
labor
relations
act
execute
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
leaves
each
employee
free
to
join
the
union
or
not
as
he
chooses,
but
which
requires
every
employee
as
a
condition
of
employment
to
pay
the
union
a
sum
or
sums
equivalent
to
its
initiation
fee
and
periodic
dues.
such
a
contract
is
called
the
“agency
shop”.
it
contrasts
with
the
pure
union
shop
and
that
the
union
shop
in
its
pure
form
required
membership
as
a
condition
of
employment.
this,
i
say,
does
not
require
membership
but
requires
merely
the
payment
of
sums
equivalent
to
those
that
--
that
union
members
would
pay.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
fair
to
say,
as
i
shall
develop
a
little
later
in
my
argument,
it's
entirely
clear
under
this
proposal
and
under
the
existing
general
motors
uaw
contract
that
anyone
who
pays
the
money
is
entitled,
if
he
alleged
that
it's
entirely
his
right
in
his
free
election
to
all
the
benefits
of
membership.
so
that
i
think
it's
not
fair
to
say
that
there
are
any
burdens
imposed
on
anyone
unless
he
chooses
to
suffer
the
burdens
and
not
have
the
benefit.
that's
a
matter
of
contract
right
and
it
was
clearly
implicit
in
the
union's
proposal.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
saying
that
this
is
the
--
well,
i'm
saying
that
anyone
who
offers
to
pay
these
sums
is
entitled
to
be
a
member.
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
unfair
to
say
that
any
burdens
are
put
on
him
without
the
benefit.
now,
he
may
wish,
and
this
is
the
theory
of
the
agency
shop,
he
may
wish
not
to
engage
in
personal
association
with
the
union.
he
may
feel
that
that
requires
a
surrender
of
individual
liberty
of
a
character
which
is
somewhat
different
from
simply
paying
a
tax,
if
you
will,
equivalent
contribution,
but
that
is
left
up
to
the
individual.
the
point
that
i
did
want
to
emphasize,
mr.
justice,
if
you
will
look
at
page
101
of
the
record,
the
general
motors-uaw
contract,
down
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page,
stipulates
the
union
shall
accept
into
membership
each
employee
covered
by
this
agreement
who
tenders
to
the
union
the
periodic
dues
and
the
initiation
fees.
so
that
anyone
who
pays
these
sums
could
join
the
union
and
have
all
the
privileges
of
union
membership
without
doing
anything
more
than
paying
those
sums.
and
it's
quite
clear
that
that
was
the
nature
of
the
union's
proposal.
so
if
he
has
benefits
with
--
has
burdens
without
benefit
that
is
his
voluntary
surrender
of
a
perfectly
clear
right,
and
i
don't
think
that
i
simply
wouldn't
apply
the
term
burden
to
that
situation.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
normal
collective
bargaining
pension
fund
is
applicable
to
all
the
employees
in
the
union
and
such
funds
are
common
even
though
there
is
no
union
shop
clause
or
--
and
no
agency
shop
clause.
there
are
some
unions
which
operate
their
own
pension
funds
for
members.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
contract,
as
i
understand
it,
would
not
--
well
this
union,
i
believe,
doesn't
operate
any
such
pension
fund.
and
i
don't
think
these
payments
would
include
any
contribution
to
a
pension
fund
if
they're
not
entitled
to
recover.
this
would
certainly,
in
any
event,
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
how
this
case
comes
up,
this
arises
simply
on
the
union
proposal
that
the
company
bargained
for
the
proposed
agency
shop
clause.
and
if
there
are
any
details
in
the
exact
form
of
the
agency
shop
clause,
it
would
make
a
difference.
i
don't
think
there
are.
and
surely,
the
company's
reply
should
have
been
not
an
absolute
refusal
to
negotiate
but
a
sitting
down
and
negotiating
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
what
--
making
minor
changes
or
ascertaining
just
what
it
was
that
the
union
meant.
the
question
arose
for
these
reasons.
general
motors
and
the
uaw
have
long
had
a
national
union
shop
agreement,
but
it
is
applicable
by
its
terms
only
in
those
states
in
which
union,
compulsory
union
membership
agreements
have
not
been
outlawed
by
state
law.
the
agreement
was
not
applicable
in
indiana
because
indiana
does
have
a
law
that
requires
--
that
prohibits
contracts
requiring
union
membership
as
a
condition
of
employment.
in
1959,
an
indiana
appellate
court
held
that
the
state
statute
did
not
forbid
the
agency
shop
and
that
the
agency
shop
since
it
did
not
require
this
personal
association
was
lawful
under
the
indiana
statute.
the
uaw
then
requested
general
motors
to
bargain
an
agency
shop
clause
applicable
to
the
indiana
employees.
general
motors
categorically
refused.
upon
those
facts,
the
board
first
held
that
the
refusal
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice,
but
later
on
a
motion
for
reconsideration,
changed
its
view
and
held
that
general
motors
had
committed
the
unfair
labor
practice
of
refusing
to
bargain
collectively.
it
ordered
general
motors
to
bargain
and
that
is
the
order
that
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside.
you'll
note
that
the
issue
thus
raised
is
truly
very
narrow.
general
motors
is
guilty
of
a
refusal
to
bargain
if,
but
only
if,
the
agency
shop
clause
is
valid.
the
agency
shop
clause
is
admittedly
valid
so
far
as
indiana
law
is
concerned.
it's
also
admittedly
invalid,
one
might
say,
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
either
discrimination
to
induce
union
membership
or
as
interference
of
coercion
with
the
freedom
of
choice,
unless
it
falls
under
the
proviso
to
section
8
(a)
(3)
which
are
the
statutes
at
the
last
page
of
our
brief,
which
provides
that
nothing
in
the
act
or
any
other
federal
statute,
shall
preclude
an
employer
from
making
an
agreement
with
a
labor
organization
omitting
a
few
words
to
require
as
a
condition
of
employment
membership
therein.
plainly,
the
proviso
covers
the
union
shop.
the
question
here
is
whether
it
covers
the
contract
much
more
tolerant
than
personal
liberty
and
of
freedom
of
choice
under
the
act
which
requires
each
employee
to
pay
the
equivalent
of
the
initiation
fee
and
dues,
but
does
not
require
him
in
any
personal
sense
to
become
a
member
of
the
labor
organization.
the
court
below
--
mr.
archibald
cox
he
--
well,
i
would
put
it
--
i
would
put
it
this
way.
i
suppose
not
everyone
would
agree,
but
certainly
there
are
many
people
who
feel
that
what
you
do
with
your
money
and
what
you
are
obliged
to
do
isn't
the
only
measure
or
even
the
most
important
measure
of
your
individual
liberty.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
to
the
extent,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
one
does
not
have
any
feelings
that
it
makes
difference
to
him
whether
he
must
belong
to
an
organization,
then
i
would
say
there
was
no
difference.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
there
are
those
who
feel
that
there
is
an
important
difference.
there
are
cases.
i
recall
the
miller
case
in
california
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
where
it
was
felt
that
there
was
a
major
difference
between
these
two
things.
now
if
that's
not
an
important
difference,
then
it's
not
to
that
extent
by
more
tolerant
of
is
immaterial
and
i
would
say
they
were
just
the
same
thing.
mr.
archibald
cox
indeed
--
mr.
archibald
cox
precisely,
precisely.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
i
think,
indeed,
i
shall
argue
that
the
union
shop
as
watered
down
by
the
taft-hartley
act
is
in
every
respect,
of
every
significant
respect,
the
same
thing.
and
this
indeed
is
the
first
reason
on
which
i
argue
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong,
because
the
true
union
shop
is
no
longer
required
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
that
is
made
quite
apparent
by
the
second
proviso
of
the
section
8
(a)
(3)
over
on
page
46.
the
second
proviso
most
of
the
court
will
recall,
provides
that
no
employer
shall
justify
any
discrimination
against
the
employee
for
nonmembership
in
the
labor
organization.
if
he
has
reasonable
grounds
for
believing
that
membership
was
denied
or
terminated
for
reasons
other
than
the
failure
of
the
employee
to
tender
the
periodic
dues
and
the
initiation
fees,
he's
not
required
to
be
a
member
in
any
other
sense,
then
that
he
must
tender
the
periodic
dues
and
initiation
fees.
certainly,
it's
not
so
required
as
a
condition
of
employment.
and
the
court
pointed
this
out
in
the
radio
officers'
case
in
a
passage
that's
quoted
in
our
brief.
the
point
justice
stewart
that
i
did
want
to
emphasize
and
perhaps
i
became
a
little
too
enthusiastic
was
this
matter
of
their
being
--
these
employees
who
don't
join
and
who
are
subject
to
the
agency
shop
being
forced
to
carry
additional
burdens.
i
do
think
that
there's
no
merit
to
that
argument
because
of
this
clause
in
the
general
motors
contract.
the
general
motors
contract
itself
dramatizes
the
insignificance
of
this
purely
formal
difference
between
the
union
shop
clause
as
it
exists
under
the
taft-hartley
act
and
the
agency
shop
clause.
if
you
look
again
at
page
101
of
the
record,
where
the
general
motors
contract
is
set
forth,
and
i'm
looking
at
paragraph
4
(a),
it
provides
that
any
employee
who
is
not
a
member
of
the
union
shall
become
a
member
of
the
union
within
60
days
and
so
forth,
and
shall
remain
a
member
of
the
union
to
the
extent
of
paying
an
initiation
fee
and
the
membership
dues.
in
other
words,
the
only
thing
that
the
clause
the
general
motors
says
is
valid
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
requires
nothing
more
than
paying
the
initiation
fee
and
dues.
what
the
agency
shop
clause
required
is
paying
a
sum
equal
to
the
initiation
fee
and
dues,
and
i
suggest
with
all
respect
that
that
certainly
tweedledum
and
tweedledee
and
nobody
has
any
suggest
--
ever
suggested
any
meaningful
difference
between
the
two.
our
second
reason
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
think
it
suggests
if
counsel
will
forbid
me,
that
the
uaw
was
wrong
and
not
contending
that
the
present
contract
is
an
agency
shop
clause
under
indiana
law.
i
say
wrong,
they
may
have
had
reasons
that
i'm
not
aware
of.
all
i
meant
to
imply
was
the
argument
certainly
could
be
made.
our
second
reason
for
rejecting
the
argument
that
was
advanced
by
general
motors
and
was
espoused
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
it
disregards
the
office
and
function
of
the
proviso
as
revealed
both
by
the
structure
of
the
statute
and
by
its
legislative
history.
if
you
were
to
take
section
8
(a)
(1)
prohibiting
interference,
coercion,
and
restraint
where
the
rights
are
guaranteed
in
section
7,
and
where
to
take
section
8
(a)
(3)
prohibiting
discrimination
that
encourages
or
discourages
membership
in
any
labor
organization,
and
where
to
have
stopped
there,
then
of
course,
all
forms
of
union
security
clause:
union
shop,
agency
shop,
closed
shop,
all
the
rest
of
them,
would
have
been
unlawful.
now,
the
office
of
the
proviso
was
to
say
that
in
collective
bargaining,
you
may
go
up
to
a
certain
point.
we're
going
to
qualify
these
rights
once
the
union
becomes
the
bargaining
representative
up
to
a
certain
extent.
and
it
makes
--
there's
no
earthly
reason
from
the
standpoint
of
that
policy
to
distinguish
between
the
agency
shop
or
the
preferential
shop
or
the
maintenance
of
membership
clause,
or
any
other
form
of
the
union
security
which
is
more
consonant
with
the
guarantees
of
freedom
of
choice
and
individual
liberty
than
the
strict
closed
shop
as
it
originally
was.
now,
this
is
not
just
a
matter
of
speculation
on
my
part,
the
legislative
history
of
the
wagner
act
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
purpose
of
the
proviso
was
to
preserve
to
unions
and
employers
in
negotiations
with
them
the
status
quo
with
respect
to
the
power
of
contracting
once
the
union
had
become
the
bargaining
representative.
the
senate
committee
report
stated
that
the
bill
does
not
interfere
with
the
status
quo
on
this
debatable
subject,
but
leaves
the
way
open
to
such
agreements
as
might
now
be
legally
consummated
and
of
course
they
included
even
that
early,
a
variety
of
forms
of
what
we
now
call
‘union
security
clauses'
which
were
then
usually
loosely
referred
to
as
the
closed
shop
whether
they
were
closed
shop
clauses
or
not.
our
third
reason
for
rejecting
the
interpretation
below
and
for
supporting
the
board's
interpretation
is
that
the
interpretation
below
would
defeat
while
the
board's
interpretation
would
advance
that
one
of
the
basic
statutory
policies,
that's
the
policy
of
encouraging
the
representatives
of
employees
and
the
employers
to
work
out
the
issues
between
them
by
collective
bargaining
and
by
negotiation
in
an
effort
to
write
those
contracts
which
are
most
consonant
with
their
individual
needs
and
aspiration.
the
great
virtue
of
collective
bargaining
is
its
flexibility,
its
adaptability,
its
creativity.
i
think
one
can
say
that
for
half
a
century
there's
been
no
more
explosive
issue
than
the
union
security
question.
what
the
interpretation
below
does
is
to
outlaw
most,
if
not
all,
the
variance
of
the
union
security
clause
that
have
been
negotiated
and
worked
out
over
the
past
25
years
by
employers
and
unions
in
collective
bargaining
and
to
restrict
them
to
one
of
the
more
stringent
forms
of
the
union
security
clause,
take
it
or
leave
it,
without
any
room
for
this
flexible,
adaptable,
creative
process.
and
i
emphasize
that
this
would
be
the
consequence
not
only
in
indiana
but
in
every
state
where
we're
now
disputing
not
the
indiana
law
but
the
meaning
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i
would
illustrate
this
point
because
i
think
it's
very
important,
by
just
four
examples
of
the
kind
of
clauses
that
have
been
worked
out
over
the
past
quarter
century
which
would
be
outlawed
certainly
by
the
logic
of
the
respondent's
argument.
now
take
first
the
so-called
union
preference
clause
which
was
brought
into
prominence
by
louis
brandeis
before
he
became
a
member
of
this
court.
that
clause
requires
an
employer
to
give
preference
to
union
members
in
new
hiring.
it
does
not
require
any
existing
employee
to
become
a
member
of
the
union
as
a
condition
or
employment
or
require
any
employee
to
maintain
membership
after
he's
been
employed.
it
does
not
even
make
union
membership
an
absolute
requirement
for
being
employed.
under
respondent's
argument,
this
clause
would,
so
far
as
i
can
see,
unquestionably
be
illegal
because
it
does
not
literally
require
membership
as
a
condition
of
employment.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
that
there
are
many
industries
where
it's
used
today.
the
last
that
i
know
of
which
may
retain
it
in
some
places,
is
the
--
well,
let
me
answer
you
and
then
you
state
why
i'm
wrong
--
it's
in
the
waterfront.
and
it's
not
of
importance
today,
mr.
justice
stewart.
that
remained
true
up
until
1947.
but
of
course
today
you
can't
discriminate
in
hiring
because
the
taft-hartley
act
outlaws
the
closed
shop.
but
remember,
we
are
construing
not
just
the
current
statute,
but
a
proviso
that
goes
all
the
way
back
to
the
wagner
act
when
this
was
important
and
the
preferential
shop
clause
does
show
this
intent
of
the
congress
because
the
senate
labor
committee
explicitly
refer
to
the
preferential
shop
in
saying
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
proviso
is
to
make
it
possible
to
negotiate
preferential
shop
centrally.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
be
illegal
but
not
for
the
reason
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
not
for
the
reason
of
general
motors.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
now
my
second
illustration,
of
course,
is
legal
under
the
present
law
and
that's
the
maintenance
of
membership
clause
developed
chiefly
during
the
war
under
the
offices
of
the
war
labor
board
which
represents
again
and
compromised
because
it
recognizes
that
no
employee
can
be
compelled
to
enter
into
an
association
not
of
his
choosing.
also,
it
gave
effect
to
notions
of
freedom
of
contract
and
responsibility
of
contract
by
saying
that
if
you
do
enter
into
the
relationship,
you
may
bind
yourself
and
indeed
must
bind
yourself
for
a
certain
period.
the
maintenance
of
membership
clause
does
not
unconditionally
require
membership
of
employees
as
a
condition
of
employment.
it
requires
only
those
who
have
voluntarily
chosen
to
join
to
be
members.
so
again,
there's
something
taken
off
the
literal
words
in
the
statute.
our
third
illustration
is
the
so-called
harmony
clause.
there
have
been
a
number
of
employers
who
very
genuinely
accepted
collective
bargaining
and
were
desired
to
encourage
the
union,
believe
that
the
union
should
be
secured
to
plan
but
were
unwilling
to
take
the
final
step
of
telling
an
employee,
“you're
fired
unless
you
will
join
the
union.”
and
many
of
those
employers
have
mediated
disputes
in
this
fashion
signed
the
contract
requiring
the
employer
to
call
the
employees
in
and
urge
them
to
join
the
union
and
tell
that
the
employer
believed
in
the
union
and
in
collective
bargaining,
but
left
him
free
not
to
take
that
final
step.
now,
under
the
respondent's
interpretation
of
that
kind
of
clause,
clearly,
with
that
kind
of
activity
and
the
clause
calling
for
it,
would
clearly
be
illegal.
finally,
i
should
point
out
that
also
the
term
‘agency
shop'
is
of
comparatively
reasonable
advantage,
the
substance
of
what
is
required
by
an
agency
shop
clause
that
goes
a
good
deal
for
the
fact.
the
war
labor
board
ordered
employers
and
unions
to
include
in
their
collective
bargaining
agreements,
clauses
that
stipulated
that
no
employee
should
be
required
to
be
a
union
member
as
a
condition
of
employment,
but
it
also
stipulated
that
every
employee
in
the
bargaining
unit
must
pay
support
money
where
it's
frequently
called,
equal
to
the
initiation
fee
and
dues
as
a
condition
of
employment.
another
variant
of
what's
essentially
the
same
thing
was
sometimes
described
as
the
compulsory
check-off
without
the
closed
union
shop
which
again
required
this
financial
support.
the
best
known
instance
was
the
rand
formula,
as
it
was
called,
because
of
an
arbitration
award
by
justice
rand
of
the
supreme
court
of
canada
which
disposed
of
a
dispute
between
ford
and
the
uaw
in
canada
in
that
fashion.
these
practices
are
important
for
several
reasons.
first,
i
think
they
demonstrate
the
importance
of
my
point
that
the
policy
of
the
act
requires
an
interpretation
that
leaves
a
room
for
bargaining
rather
than
constricts
the
bargaining.
second,
they
represent
a
practical
interpretation
of
the
proviso
to
the
wagner
act
during
the
12
years
between
the
adoption
of
the
wagner
act
and
the
enactment
of
the
taft-hartley
amendments.
and
congress
surely
acted,
indeed
we
know
congress
acted
and
continued
to
use
the
words
after
the
parties
in
collective
bargaining
had
been
negotiating
since
the
contract
often
under
government
offices
for
10
or
12
years.
third,
we
know
that
the
rand
formula
and
other
information
of
this
kind,
was
in
fact
called
to
the
attention
of
the
congress,
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
my
brief
at
the
time
of
the
taft-hartley
debates.
indeed,
senator
taft
in
discussing
the
conference
report
referred
to
the
rand
formula
with
approval.
and
said
this
is
in
effect
what
we
have
done.
we
have
set
up
a
system
under
which
the
union
may
get
the
financial
support
without
the
other
burdens
on
employees
that
are
required
by
the
strict
union
shop
the
a
fortiori
the
closed
shop
contract.
the
combination
of
those
reasons
seems
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes,
that's
true.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
myself,
if
i
may,
for
a
few
minutes
to
the
relationship
between
section
8
(a)
(3)
and
section
14
(b)
because
the
two
used
the
same
phrase
and
the
court
has
before
it
in
the
next
case,
the
schermerhorn
case,
the
question
whether
the
states
under
section
14
(b)
may
regulate
or
prohibit
the
agency
shop
as
something
coming
under
the
phrase
“contracts
requiring
membership
in
a
union
as
a
condition
of
employment”.
if
the
court
should
decide
that
the
agency
shop
comes
under
section
14
(b),
then
a
fortiori
it
must
reverse
the
decision
below
in
this
case.
the
converse
is
not
necessarily
true
if
the
court
were
to
interpret
the
words
requiring
union
membership
therein
very
strictly,
very
literally,
it
might
still
conclude
that
that
was
the
definition
of
the
outer
line
of
the
exception.
and
that
if
you're
looking
at
it
in
terms
of
the
policy
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
unions
may
go
up
to
the
line.
you're
looking
at
it
in
terms
of
what
the
states
may
do,
you
come
from
the
other
side
and
the
line
would
then
define.
i
point
out
the
possibility
the
view
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
that
the
words
were
used
in
the
same
sense,
that
the
words
requiring
membership
in
a
union
as
a
condition
of
employment
were
used
somewhat
loosely
to
symbolize
all
forms
of
compulsory
connection
with
the
union,
and
that
they
cover
the
agency
shop
in
both
instance
--
instances,
and
indeed,
we
think
we
are
aided
in
this
respect
by
the
legislative
history
of
section
14
(b).
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
was
just
--
well,
i
was
just
about
to
draw
what
i
think
is
a
very
important
distinction,
would
you
say
any
type
of
union
security
--
i
might
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
three
or
four
examples
that
i
have
given,
i
would
say
yes
to
it,
but
i
do
want
to
emphasize
and
i
think
it's
very
important
as
defining
the
perimeters
of
this
problem.
the
difference
between
what
i
would
call
compulsory
unionism
and
a
true
service
fee,
i'd
like
to
take
a
minute,
if
i
may,
to
illustrate
this
important
difference.
mr.
archibald
cox
a
true
service
fee.
now,
i'm
going
to
explain
what
i
mean
by
the
two.let
me
take
it
clear
instance
first.
suppose
that
a
union
operates
a
--
say
in
the
construction
industry
or
along
the
waterfront,
operates
a
hiring
hall
and
search
as
it
must
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
all
employees,
members
and
nonmembers
equally,
and
it
requires
a
fee
for
everyone
who
goes
as
hired
through
the
hall
as
it
charge
for
the
service.
in
the
case
of
the
union
member,
it's
a
portion
of
his
dues.
in
the
case
of
the
nonmember,
it
will
have
to
be
a
payment
of
15
cents,
25
cents,
50
cents,
whatever
the
case
may
be.
it
is
a
payment
of
that
kind,
may
i
continue
just
a
moment?
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
a
payment
of
that
kind
that
i
refer
to
as
a
true
service
fee,
something
in
exchange
for
considerations
rendered.
the
board
held
in
a
homan
case,
cited
in
our
brief
that
such
a
system
with
the
payment
of
the
service
fee
was
consistent
with
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
i
would
say
that
that
kind
of
contractual
arrangement
was
valid
entirely
without
regard
to
the
proviso
of
the
section
8
(a)
(3)
because
it's
not
interference,
coercion,
or
restraint
to
stay
with
the
service.
and
equally,
i
would
say,
that
the
state
may
not
forbid
such
a
service
fee
under
section
14
(b).
then
the
question
arises,
well
how
far
do
you
carry
this?
take
in
one
further
illustration.
one
of
the
very
heavy
financial
burdens
on
a
local
union
is
the
cause
of
arbitrating
grievances.
arbitrators
charge
quite
a
fee
and
both
sides
frequently
think
that
they
need
lawyers.
a
union
might
conceivably
set
up
sort
of
an
insurance
fund.
everybody
who
must
contribute
to
the
fund
as
sufficient
premium
to
pay
the
expected
annual
or
five-year
cause
of
arbitration
wouldn't
that
also
be
a
service
fee
at
outside
the
scope
of
section
14
(b)?
and
i
would
say,
yes,
that
it
would.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
like
the
homan
case.
now,
if
you
--
as
you
keep
adding
the
things
covered
by
the
service
fees,
you
obviously
get
closer
and
closer
to
the
union
shop
and
the
question
would
arise
where
if
this
distinction
has
validity,
is
the
line
to
be
drawn
between
them.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
terms
of
the
underlying
policies,
that
the
line,
we've
spelled
this
out
at
more
length
in
our
brief,
that
the
line
should
surely
be
drawn
between
those
things
like
the
collective
bargaining
contract,
grievance
arbitration,
the
hiring
hall,
of
where
the
employee
gets
some
direct
and
immediate
benefits.
and
those
things
that
unions
engage
in
which
may
go
counter
to
the
political
or
social
or
economic
views
of
the
employee,
political
activities,
lobbying,
legislative
activity,
and
so
forth.
i'm
suggesting
this
distinction
essentially
for
two
reasons.
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
important
in
any
case
before
the
court.
i'm
suggesting
it
first
because
it
seems
to
me
important
to
bear
the
perimeters
of
the
problem
in
mind.
because
it
would
be
unfortunate
if
the
issue
doesn't
have
to
be
decided.
that
the
court
should
say
anything
that
shut
off
a
development
along
these
lines
which
it
seems
too
many
of
us
at
least
to
offer
promising
opportunities.
in
addition,
i
want
to
make
it
very
plain
that
if
the
court
should
hold
that
a
true
service
fee,
not
all
the
union
initiation
fees
and
dues
that
go
to
a
manyfold
variety
of
activities
is
beyond
state
control
under
section
14
(b),
that
that
certainly
would
not
require
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below
that
the
distinctions
between
a
service
fee
and
the
agency
shop
that
i
have
suggested
are
certainly
valid
and
operate
in
that
direction
even
if
they
do
not
operate
in
the
other.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
an
unsettled
question,
justice
white.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
board
hasn't
ruled
on
it
and
it
hasn't
been
presented
and
consequently,
i
don't
feel
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
free
to
state
how
the
board
would
rule.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
assume
that
the
board
would
follow
any
state
determination
upon
that
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
it
is
very
doubtful
that
the
board
--
and
i
say
this
rightfully.
i
think
it
is
very
doubtful
that
the
board
would
undertake
to
act
under
section
8
(a)
(3)
where
the
contract
and
the
practice
pursuant
to
contract
were
entirely
valid
so
far
as
national
is
always
concerned,
and
it
was
uncertain
what
was
their
status
under
state
law.
in
other
words,
if
they
were
going
to
take
the
view
at
all
that
the
state
law
was
relevant
i'm
advised
that
every
reason
to
think
that
they
will
do
it
only
where
the
state
law
was
clear.
and
the
other
question
they
haven't
decided
and
therefore
i
don't
think
i
should
express
an
opinion
on
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
take
just
one
moment
in
the
time
that
you
offer
me
if
i
may
reply.
to
deal
with
this
matter,
once
again,
of
whether
the
agency
shop
leaves
the
employee
who
must
pay
worse
off
than
he
would
be
under
the
union
shop
agreement.
i
think
i
can
make
my
point
very
simply
by
borrowing
mr.
justice
stewart's
example
of
the
man
in
front
of
the
movie
theater.
if
there
were
two
of
us
there,
one
of
whom
was
chores
to
turn
over
a
dollar
and
to
see
the
movie,
he
would
get
something
in
exchange.
if
there
were
another
there
who
were
simply
forced
to
give
over
the
dollar
and
couldn't
see
the
movie,
he
would
be
worse
off.
but
that
is
not,
i
respect,
what
happen
--
respectfully
submit
what
happens
under
the
agency
shop
under
this
contract.
he
is
forced
to
give
over
the
dollar,
but
he
is
told,
“you
now
have
the
right
to
go
and
see
the
movie
if
you
wish
without
doing
anything
more
than
walking
into
the
movie”.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
not
worse
off
than
if
he
were
forced
suppose
to
pay
the
dollar
and
sees
a
movie
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
which
are
the
two
things
we
are
comparing
not
if
whether
he's
worse
off
than
if
they
were
neither
taught.
we're
comparing
the
giving
up
the
dollar
under
any
circumstances
and
seeing
the
movie
by
compulsion
or
seeing
it
if
you
wish.
i
would
suggest
to
whether
seeing
the
movie
by
compulsion
if
the
movie
industry
will
not
block
--
well
maybe
they're
worse
off.
