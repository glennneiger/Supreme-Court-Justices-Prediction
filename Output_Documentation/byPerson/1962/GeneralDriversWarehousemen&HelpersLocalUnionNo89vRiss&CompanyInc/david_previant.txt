mr.
david
previant
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
pleases;
this
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
denying
the
enforcement
of
what
we
describe
as
a
grievance
award.
since
the
genesis
of
the
case
is
on
the
filing
of
a
complaint
in
the
district
court,
and
since
the
lower
courts
made
their
determination
on
the
basis
of
a
motion
to
dismiss,
holding
that
the
facts
alleged
in
the
complaint
were
not
sufficient
to
predicate
a
cause
of
action
or
claim
for
relief,
the
only
facts
which
are
really
before
this
court
are
those
facts
which
are
pleaded
in
that
bill
of
complaint.
the
operative,
operative
facts
may
be
summarized
as
follows.
the
petitioner
local
89
is
a
local
labor
organization,
having
its
office
in
louisville,
kentucky.
the
six
individual
petitioners
are
members
of
local
89
and
they
are
represented
by
local
89
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
with
an
employer
who
is
the
respondent
here,
riss
&
company.
riss
&
company
is
an
interstate
carrier
of
freight
having
among
other
places
in
this
country,
a
terminal
in
louisville
and
one
in
philadelphia.
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
local
89
and
the
riss
company
which
its
counterpart
has
been
before
this
court
on
a
number
of
occasions
before,
it’s
exhibit
a
in
the
record.
it’s
a
multiemployer,
multi-union,
multi-state
contract.
the
contract
provides
among
other
things
--
mr.
david
previant
it
is
virtually
the
same
contract,
although
this
one
covers
local
cartage
operations
where
the
out
of
the
case
covers
that
--
mr.
david
previant
--
over
the
rule.
but
the
contract
clauses
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
--
mr.
david
previant
--
are
the
same.
they
are
actually
the
same
that
we're
also
able
to
translate
and
in
the
nebraska
short
lines
case,
local
524
(inaudible).
the
contract
contains,
among
other
things
a
provision
called
“protection
of
rights”,
which
provides
that
it
shall
not
be
a
violation
of
the
contract,
and
it
shall
not
be
cause
for
discharge
if
any
employee
or
employees
refuse
to
go
through
the
picket
line
of
the
union,
or
refuse
to
handle
unfair
goods.
incidentally
i
should
say
that,
as
many
times
and
as
many
lawyers
who
have
read
the
record
in
this
case,
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
last
night
that
a
very
important
word,
the
word
“not”
was
omitted
from
the
complaint
as
printed
in
the
record
but
the
contract
clause
itself
is
as
i
have
read
it,
in
the
contract
attached
to
the
record
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
itself
that
is
quoted
incorrectly
as
being,
“it
shall
not
be
a
violation
of
the
contract”.
the
record
would
indicate
that
it
shall
be
a
violation
of
the
contract.
the
validity
of
this
clause
incidentally
has
not
been
challenged
in
these
proceedings.
the
riss
&
company
had
a
labor
dispute
with
a
local
union
in
philadelphia.
that
local
union
sent
its
pickets
to
louisville,
to
picket
the
riss
terminal
there.
exercising
the
right,
assured
to
them
by
this
contract
provision
to
which
i
referred,
these
six
petitioners,
members
of
the
union
and
employees
of
riss
refused
to
go
through
that
picket
line
and
they
continued
in
such
refusal
for
approximately
three
weeks.
it
was
in
early
1960.
they
then
offered
to
return
to
work
and
presented
themselves
for
work.
however,
the
company
refused
to
permit
them
to
return.
accordingly,
they
filed
a
grievance
under
the
provisions
of
this
contract
in
which
they
sought
reinstatement
to
their
employment,
wages
from
the
time
that
they
had
offered
to
return
to
work
and
were
refused
such
right
to
return,
some
vacation
pay
which
had
accumulated,
and
also
requiring
the
employer
to
make
certain
contributions
to
a
health
and
welfare
trust
fund
which
provided
hospital
and
medical
and
sick
benefits
for
the
employees,
and
certain
contributions
to
a
pension
trust
fund
which
provided
pensions
at
age
60.
these
contributions
are
predicated
according
to
the
contract
on
so
much
per
employee
per
each
week
worked
and
go
into
the
trust
fund
and
do
not
go
to
the
pocket
of
these
six
employees
who
were
then
denied
their
right
to
return
to
work.
the
grievance
procedure
itself
is
set
forth
in
article
vii
and
article
viii
of
the
agreement.
article
vii
establishes
a
series
of
committees.
all
of
them
are
bipartisan
committees.
there's
equal
representation
by
the
employer,
equal
representation
by
the
union.
there
is
a
local
area
committee
which
first
considers
disputes
and
controversies
if
the
parties
cannot
settle
them
directly.
if
the
local
area
committee
cannot
settle
the
dispute,
it
goes
to
what
is
called
a
local
joint
state
committee,
again
a
bipartisan
committee
which
makes
an
effort
to
settle
the
dispute.
and
if
they
do
not
settle
the
dispute,
or
if
it
is
a
matter
of
interpretation,
it
goes
to
what
is
known
as
a
joint
area
committee,
which
is
a
larger
committee
comprising
representatives
of
the
unions
and
employers
in
a
multi-state
area.
in
all
instances,
if
there
is
a
majority
vote
in
either
committee
as
they
go
up,
that
will
settle
the
dispute.
if
the
two
lower
committees
are
deadlocked,
it
goes
up
automatically.
when
it
reaches
the
top
committee,
if
there
is
a
majority
decision
then
that
dispute
is
finally
settled.
if
there
is
no
majority
decision
at
that
point,
then
the
parties
are
free
to
use
the
vernacular,
grab
their
best
holds.
they
may,
if
they
desire
submit
to
umpire
handling.
the
union
may
--
mr.
david
previant
the
district
court
did
not,
and
apparently
the
court
of
appeals
did.
mr.
david
previant
well
it
didn't
--
it
did
not
say
that
the
joint
area
committee
determination
was
not
final.
it
just
said
that
the
entire
grievance
procedure
did
not
have
the
finality
because
i
believed
it
was
looking
at
this
step.
mr.
david
previant
there
was
an
agreement,
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
precisely.
mr.
david
previant
i
don't
read
the
court
of
appeals
decision
saying
that
that
particular
decision
was
--
lacked
finality.
i
read
it
only
as
saying
that
since
there
is
not
what
we
consider
in
the
practical
sense
lets
say,
a
final
arbitration
award.
mr.
david
previant
or
a
compulsory
arbitration,
the
procedure
had
no
finality.
mr.
david
previant
right.
mr.
david
previant
that's
right.
mr.
david
previant
precisely
so
justice
brennan,
that's
exactly
what
happened.
mr.
david
previant
no,
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
should
make
that
necessarily.
i
think
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
we
had
the
sufficient
basis
to
say
in
court,
this
court
would
have
to
conclude
that
under
the
contract,
there
was
a
decision
here.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
because
this
arose
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
there
had
been
a
counterclaim
filed
and
many
other
charges
made
--
mr.
david
previant
exactly,
exactly.
the
--
well,
the
joint
area
committee
as
justice
brennan
has
pointed
out
did
determine
the
dispute.
it
directed
that
these
drivers
be
reinstated.
it
directed
that
they
be
given
back
pay
and
their
proportion
of
vacation
earnings.
it
directed
to
that
the
company
do
pay
up
its
contributions
which
were
delinquent
in
both
the
health
and
welfare
and
in
the
pension
trust
funds.
the
employer
refused
to
comply
with
that
award.
and
because
of
that
refusal,
that
the
complaint
which
i
have
just
summarized
was
then
brought
in
the
western
--
federal
court
for
the
western
district
of
kentucky.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
at
this
point,
at
respondent's
brief
refers
to
many
other
facts
in
addition
to
those
which
i
have
just
outlined
here.
those
are
facts
which
the
respondent
alleged
in
its
answer
and
counterclaim.
they
are
not
facts
in
the
record
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
since
this
case
was
decided
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
based
upon
the
complaint.
so
i
would
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
whatever
additional
facts
may
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
with
respect
to
whether
this
was
a
strike,
with
respect
to
whether
there
were
threats,
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
the
picketing
is
not
and
was
not
before
either
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
or
this
court,
or
the
--
and
was
not
before
this
court
below.
the
complaint
sought
precisely
the
same
relief
which
was
granted
to
these
six
employees
by
the
joint
area
committee.
the
respondent,
in
making
answer
to
the
complaint
asserted
as
its
first
defense
that
the
complaint
did
not
state
facts
upon
which
a
claim
for
relief
could
be
based.
it
went
on
to
refer
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
state
court
suit
pending
in
which
the
respondent,
the
employer
was
a
plaintiff
in
which
he
was
seeking
damages.
it
said
that
the
stoppage
or
the
recognition
of
the
picket
line
was
in
fact
a
breach
of
the
contract
and
therefore
it
was
not
required
to
submit
to
or
nor
was
it
bound
by
the
grievance
procedure.
and
that
grievance
procedure
for
that
reason
was
a
sham
and
made
a
counterclaim
for
the
damages
it
suffered
as
a
result
of
this
refusal
to
go
to
the
picket
line
subsequently,
an
amended
complaint
was
fought
--
a
counterclaim
was
filed
for
injunction,
an
effort
to
restrain
the
picketing.
none
of
these
matters
came
to
trial.
issue
was
not
joined
on
that.
at
a
pretrial
hearing
called
by
the
district
judge,
consideration
was
given
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
court
made
a
very
simple
order
saying,
“on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
it
is
granted
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
on
the
authority
of
westinghouse”,
the
court
reading
westinghouse
as
precluding
a
claim
of
this
kind
because
it
was
--
for
the
benefit
of
these
six
individual
petitioners.
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
the
lower
court's
order
and
judgment
was
affirmed.
this
court
went
beyond
however,
the
reason
given
by
the
lower
court.
it
did
say
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
under
westinghouse
because
in
the
words
of
the
court,
the
purpose
of
the
action
is
to
recover
for
the
individual
plaintiff's
lost
wages
together
with
incidental
benefits
to
the
union
based
on
payment
of
wages
to
employees,
but
the
court
also
went
further.
it
said
that
the
decision
of
the
joint
area
committee
was
not
an
arbitrational
order,
therefore,
lincoln
mills
and
the
other
cases
were
not
aptable.
mr.
david
previant
surely.
mr.
david
previant
right.
mr.
david
previant
right.
mr.
david
previant
the
record
is
silent
now,
and
i
think
on
the
basis
of
the
record,
we
must
assume
that
it
was
no
less
than
a
majority
and
probably
a
unanimous
opinion.
mr.
david
previant
the
deadlock
referred
to
there
justice
goldberg
is
in
the
event,
the
union
and
employer
representatives
at
this
top
level
of
the
grievance
procedure
are
unable
to
agree
on
a
final
disposition
of
the
matter
then
if
a
majority
of
them
say,
“in
view
of
our
disagreement
perhaps
instead
of
having
a
strike,
or
instead
of
prolonging
this
matter,
it
ought
to
be
submitted
to
an
umpire
for
final
adjudication,”
it
is
submitted
to
adjudication.
if
they
don't
go
that
far
then
this
question
of
whether
or
not
they're
entitled
to
legal
or
economic
recourse,
meaning
a
strike
or
meaning
perhaps
a
suit
for
a
declaration,
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
--
or
as
to
the
merits
of
the
particular
contracts.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
that
it's
read
it
--
well,
it's
there
in
e,
it
is
agreed
that
all
matters
pertaining
to
the
interpretation
of
any
provisions
of
this
contract
shall
be
referred
after
request
of
any
party
at
any
time
for
final
decision
to
the
joint
area
cartage
committee
after
first
being
processed
by
the
joint
state
cartage
committee.
i
think
it
is
right
out
of
f
saying
that,
if
they
deadlock
there,
then
it
may
proceed
further.
i
think
it's
in
g,
failure
to
comply
with
any
final
decision.
i
will
say
that
it
is
much
more
explicit
where
it
refers
to
the
majority
vote
in
the
local
committee,
and
the
majority
vote
in
the
state
committee
then
it
is
in
this.
it
is
much
more
explicit,
and
this
is
poor
draftsmanship
frankly.
mr.
david
previant
but
there's
been
question
raised
here
and
there
is
no
question
between
the
parties
that
this
is
actually
the
way
that
works.
mr.
david
previant
oh,
yes.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
if
the
employer
had
raised
that
question,
it
would
be
a
matter
for
determination
then
by
the
district
court
with
the
parties
having
the
opportunity
to
present
-
mr.
david
previant
no.
mr.
david
previant
we
think
you
can,
but
in
the
posture
of
this
case,
it's
not
necessary.
well,
the
court
did
say
that
there
was
no
finality
here,
but
as
i
read
it
that
the
court
was
not
saying
that
a
final
decision
in
the
joint
area
committee
was
not
final
but
because
it
was
opened
and
reading
the
bare
words
of
the
statute,
it
was
not
the
kind
of
a
contract
clause
which
was
before
this
court
in
lincoln
mills
or
the
other
cases.
and
the
court
also
went
on
and
decided
that
it
would
construe
the
contract
itself.
and
construing
the
contract,
it
came
to
an
entirely
different
conclusion.
and
the
parties
who
had
been
selected
by
the
employer
and
the
union
to
determine
what
the
contract
meant
and
actually,
it
follows
the
construction
urged
upon
it
by
the
respondent.
but
again
concerning
which,
the
union
had
no
opportunity
to
present
evidence
or
to
make
argument
before
the
district
judge
and
had
not
been
considered
at
all
by
the
district
judge.
i
think
at
the
outset,
or
at
least
i
hope
at
the
outset,
we
might
lay
the
ghost
of
westinghouse
to
rest
as
a
result
of
evening
news
decided
by
this
court
in
december,
because
as
we
read
evening
news,
it
expressly
holds
that
the
constitutional
misgivings
which
underpin
the
decision
in
westinghouse
had
since
been
debilitated
and
that
therefore
--
mr.
david
previant
--
dissipated,
a
much
stronger
word,
thank
you
and
that
therefore,
the
--
it's
no
longer
authoritative
as
a
precedent
and
the
court
went
on
to
hold
that
individual
claims
of
course
and
it
strictly
bound
up
us
they
are
with
the
interest
of
the
collective
bargaining
agent
may
and
should
be
considered.
now,
if
there
are
any
residuals
of
westinghouse
by
virtue
of
the
statement
that
the
question
of
standing
to
sue
may
be
left
open
for
a
different
occasion.
we
believe
that
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
here
sufficient
--
of
our
position
that
here
there
are
no
uniquely
personal
rights,
that
these
are
rights
which
are
an
amalgam
of
the
rights
of
the
union
and/or
the
employees
and
they
are
the
rights
which
we
believe
presently
and
historically
both
the
individuals
and
the
union
should
be
permitted
to
pursue
particularly
when
as
here,
they
pursue
them
jointly
in
this
case.
we
get
then
to
this
problem
which
we
believe
is
implicit
here
as
to
whether
or
not,
as
the
complaint
here
was
framed,
we
are
suing
on
an
award
under
these
circumstances.
the
--
and
i
suppose
candor
would
require
us
to
say
that
when
this
bill
of
complaint
was
filed
back
in
1960,
we
were
acutely
aware
of
the
westinghouse
case
and
its
implication.
surely,
we
were
not
certain
at
that
point
as
to
how
we
would
fare
in
the
federal
district
court
on
a
claim
which
sought
to
vindicate
the
individual
rights
and
employment
and
back
wages
as
well
as
the
union's
right
in
the
interpretation
and
maintaining
the
integrity
of
its
agreement.
and
this
case
was
presented
through
the
courts
and
is
presented
here
on
the
theory
that,
what
happened
in
this
proceeding
was
of
the
nature
of
an
award,
it
was
in
fact
an
award
although
it
does
not
have
all
of
the
classical
trappings
of
the
arbitrator,
the
impartial
party
selected
by
the
parties
to
the
agreement
to
come
to
a
decision
as
to
what
the
parties
intended
by
their
agreement.
the
procedure
we
believe
fully
qualifies
as
an
arbitration,
in
that,
it
is
a
determination
made
by
a
group
of
representatives
on
the
dispute
submitted
to
them
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
meaning
and
application
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
is
a
formal
procedure
and
the
decision,
certainly
partakes
in
all
sense
the
nature
of
an
award.
the
only
distinction
being
that
this
was
not
a
matter
submitted
to
an
impartial
outside
tribunal
umpire
for
that
determination.
there's
nothing
that
we
read
in
the
cases
of
this
court
on
the
definitions
of
what
is
an
arbitration
or
what
is
an
award
which
requires
that
a
particular
grievance
procedure
and
a
decision
arising
out
of
that
procedure.
in
order
to
be
classified
as
an
award
must
follow
any
particular
road
or
must
be
involved
in
any
particular,
specific
formal
procedure
which
perhaps
may
be
characteristic
of
arbitration
clauses
which
had
been
before
this
court
in
the
steelworker
cases
or
in
lincoln
mills.
i
think
that
all
of
these
cases
and
the
law
indicate
that
the
important
thing
is
that
the
parties
agree
among
themselves
on
a
procedure
for
the
settlement
of
their
disputes.
the
law
does
not
adjure
them
to
adopt
any
particular
or
special
procedure,
but
that
if
the
procedure
by
their
likes
is
well
calculated
and
would
in
fact
solve
their
problems
in
the
manner
which
they
believe
is
best
for
their
industry,
that
procedure
is
not
subject
to
attack
or
should
that
procedure
receive
less
support
in
the
courts
in
cases
of
this
kind
because
it
is
not
the
classical
procedure.
mr.
david
previant
if
the
parties
so
agreed.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
these
parties
did
hope
that
in
this
multi-step
grievance
procedure,
they
would
wash
out
most
of
the
grievances
which
would
be
of
any
trouble.
they
did
not
believe
and
required
umpire
handling.
they
had
one
unfortunate
experience
in
that
regard
early
in
their
history
and
however,
i
think
the
record
would
show
that
that
this
particular
union
under
this
particular
contract
has
been
remarkably
devoid
of
plagiarism
with
respect
to
any
strikes
where
there
is
a
contract
in
this
respect
and
this
procedure
works
for
them.
this
is
the
way
the
parties
have
agreed
they
will
solve
their
disputes
and
it
is
in
accordance
with
that
agreement
that
this
particular
proceeding
was
determined.
there
has
been
incidentally
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
this
at
no
time
during
this
proceedings
has
the
employer
or
--
taken
the
position
that
this
procedure
was
in
any
way
defective,
that
it
was
in
any
way
inadequate,
that
it
was
in
any
way
unfair.
mr.
david
previant
he
did.
mr.
david
previant
he
did
take
--
mr.
david
previant
yes.
he
took
the
position
that
because
in
his
opinion,
the
refusal
to
go
through
a
picket
line
was
a
strike.
this
breached
another
part
of
the
contract,
therefore
it
was
no
longer
bound
by
the
grievance
procedure
and
therefore
it
was
a
sham
as
far
as
he
was
concerned.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
i
would
say
that
this
position
is
taken
for
the
first
time
in
the
litigation,
but
again
this
would
be
a
matter
for
the
court
to
determine.
mr.
david
previant
yes,
i
said
it
was
not
raised
during
the
grievance
procedure.
mr.
david
previant
it
was
not
raised
during
the
grievance
procedure.
strangely
enough
and
i
would
ask
the
court's
indulgence
to
add
a
case
to
our
footnote
3
called
riss
&
company
versus
nichaslon.
mr.
david
previant
footnote
3.
i
think
on
page
8
of
our
brief.
this
was
a
--
mr.
david
previant
this
was
a
case
which
was
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals,
but
some
or
others
did
not
find
its
way
into
this
brief,
its
355
pacific
second
304.
this
case
under
the
--
a
similar
grievance
procedure,
an
employees
sued
this
respondent
saying
that
the
grievance
procedure
was
unfair
as
to
him
because
although
he
had
been
restored
to
his
job,
he
didn't
get
back
pay.
and
he
sought
in
court,
then
in
the
state
court,
an
additional
award
of
back
pay
and
this
respondent
was
there
arguing
the
integrity
of
virtually
the
identical
grievance
procedure.
and
i
say
that
the
only
change
of
position
here
is
this
argument
now
made
that
there
was
a
breach.
we
say
that
the
parties
to
the
contract
are
the
ones
who
determine
whether
there
was
a
breach
of
the
contract.
this
was
the
agreement
of
the
parties,
that
they
would
determine
among
themselves
how
to
apply
this
contract.
i
would
make
just
this
last
observation
in
connection
with
the
point
that
we
had
structured
this
lawsuit
on
the
assumption
that
we
would
be
confronted
with
westinghouse
when
we
got
here
that
even
if
this
is
not
considered
an
award,
it
is
an
interpretation
or
an
agreement
by
the
parties
to
the
contract
who
are
authorized
to
make
such
interpretation
or
agreement.
as
such,
it
becomes
a
part
of
the
contract,
and
at
such
the
contract
in
toto
maybe
enforced
by
these
petitioners,
the
union
and
its
members.
so
it
doesn't
make
much
difference
whether
you
consider
this
in
our
opinion.
whether
you
consider
this
particular
procedure
as
ending
in
an
award,
which
may
be
independently
enforced
under
301,
or
whether
you
consider
it
an
interpretation
of
the
agreement,
an
interpretation
which
the
parties
themselves
has
stated
they
would
abide
by
if
made
through
their
own
tribunals
and
by
a
majority
of
the
tribunals.
now,
on
that
basis
then
we
say
--
we
think
that
the
court
below,
certainly
misconstrued
--
mr.
david
previant
well,
the
suit
would
be
for
violation
of
the
contract
and
for
whatever
relief
the
court
might
grant
and
the
courts
have
been
granting
relief
requiring
rehiring
in
very
much
the
same
manner
--
mr.
david
previant
--
as
in
board
cases.
mr.
david
previant
there
was
a
time
when
they
didn't,
but
i
think
that
the
entire
theory
of
no
more
specific
performance
for
personal
services,
i
think
that
in
the
cases
which
came
be
for
this
court.
mr.
david
previant
there
was
a
suggestion,
i
think
there
was
a
suggestion
in
enterprise
that
these
men
were
entitled
to
return
to
work,
this
was
the
--
mr.
david
previant
i
don't
know
that
that
specific
provision
has
been
before
this
court
apart
from
an
arbitration
award
or
board
order,
but
i
see
no
difference
between
an
agreement
of
the
parties
that
an
employer
agreed
to
maintain
a
man
on
the
payroll,
or
a
decision
of
the
board
of
arbitration
that
he
shall
be
maintained
on
the
payroll
or
a
decision
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
he
shall
be
maintained
on
the
payroll.
mr.
david
previant
well
yes,
and
we
think
that
these
contracts
can
be
construed.
i
don't
want
to
get
ahead
on
myself,
we
got
a
case
coming
up
here
in
several
months
in
which
the
particular
argument
under
a
similar
contract
where
the
--
where
there
was
no
specific
provision
merely
said
the
party
shall
agree
as
to
what
the
--
what
shall
happen
in
particular
kinds
of
disputes.
the
only
point
i'm
making
here
is
that,
again
we
don't
need
the
formality
of
the
classical
award.
we
don't
need
to
have
this
procedure
called
an
arbitration
procedure.
mr.
david
previant
that's
all
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
we
think
we
have
a
solid
one
and
we
believe
that
the
parties
who
are
confided
by
the
contract
with
the
power
to
interpret
the
contract
have
interpreted
and
their
interpretation
should
not
be
biased
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
previant
yes,
i
believe
that
today
in
the
common
law
courts
and
the
equity
court
that
kind
of
relief
is
available.
i
don't
believe
that
the
old
common
law
theory
that
in
this
kind
of
a
case
you're
relegated
solely
to
damages
would
be
accepted
today.
i
don't
believe
that
in
fashioning
federal
law
in
this
field
with
the
--
mr.
david
previant
--
wide
precedent
given
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
david
previant
well,
this
would
be
an
action
for
breach
of
contract,
i
assume
under
301,
you're
talking
about
a
breach
of
contract.
mr.
david
previant
yes.
mr.
david
previant
no,
you
have
not.
mr.
david
previant
i
think
in
this
court,
it
is.
mr.
david
previant
i
would
have
thought
that
the
question
we
have
here
today
has
been
decided
by
this
court,
your
honor.
thank
you.
