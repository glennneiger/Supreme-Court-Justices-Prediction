justice
william
j.
brennan,

is
this
the
contract
in
[inaudible]?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
same
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
district
court
haven't
reached
the
question
whether
this
had
an
attribution
of
finality
for
the
purposes
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
same
thing?
at
this
stage
as
i
gather
it,
what
happened
here
was,
there
was
no
reference.
it
wasn't
like
the
yellow
transit.
there
was
no
question
of
may
or
may
not
refer
to
an
umpire.
here,
there
was
an
agreement
by
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
argument,
i
gather
is
that
for
these
purposes
that
sufficient
finality
within
steelworkers
and
ruston.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
because
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
because
of
the
structure
of
your
clause
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
i
understand
it
that
this
level
maybe
a
final
decision
and
you
say
there
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
therefore,
there
was
no
necessity
to
go
onto
the
umpire
stage
which
was
a
problem
in
the
yellow
transit,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
now,
the
only
thing
i've
wanted
to
ask
you
is
--
i
gather
this
is
a
question
of
contract
instruction.
are
you
going
to
ask
us
to
make
that
instruction
here
that
the
district
court
not
having
reached
it,
should
we
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
and
ask
them
to
decide
this
question
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
therefore,
we
could
send
it
back
to
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
had
(voice
overlap)
--
problems
before
we
decided
smith
here
and
before
we
decide
yellow
transit
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
any
event
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
any
event,
mr.
previant,
i
gather
there's
enough
good
point
that
the
district
court
and
its
gets
everything
bears
upon
what
the
meaning
of
that
is.
there
is
enough
in
the
clause
itself
to
withstand
any
motion
addressed
to
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
want
to
be
sure,
you're
not
asking
us
to
decide
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
dissipated.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
does,
he
did
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
pleaded
--
pled
that
it
was
a
sham,
did
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
proceedings.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
another
reason
this
has
to
go
back
to
district
court,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
looking
at
the
fifth
defense
at
page
17
of
the
answer,
it
was
raised
in
the
answer,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
said
in
part.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
footnote
3?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
--
what
page?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
have
a
little
trouble
with
this.
is
this
a
suggestion
that
suppose
you
had
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
jones
smith
and
robinson
following
the
strike
shall
be
reinstated
and
they're
not
reinstated?
are
you
suggesting
that
there
could
be
specific
performance
of
the
provision
for
reinstatement?
that
these
were
just
a
mere
agreement
and
not
an
arbitration
whether
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
had
been
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
specific
performance
and
things
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
we
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
apart
from
an
arbitration
award,
have
we
ever
said
that
a
provision
like
that
specifically
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that's
the
navy
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
are
right
mr.
previant,
then
as
in
the
previous
case,
we're
talking
about
seniority
clauses.
are
you
suggesting
that
an
employer
breaches
a
provision
for
seniority
that
the
employer
--
employee
has
addressed
in
the
form
of
action
for
specific
performance
of
a
seniority
relief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
would
this
be
a
301
--
i
mean
on
the
301,
or
would
it
be
under
a
common
law
[inaudible]?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
have
to
be
under
301,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
haven't
yet
fashioned
any
federal
law
at
that
time,
have
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
it's
still
open?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
