mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
asking
for
the
affirmation
of
the
decisions
of
the
two
lower
courts,
the
response
here
today
shall
be
addressed
to
four
defensive
propositions
any
one
of
which
the
respondent
contends
is
decisive
of
this
action
at
bar
and
in
the
favor
of
the
respondent.
now
these
propositions
are
as
follows;
first
is
the
purpose
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
to
protect
the
general
welfare
of
a
community
minimizing
a
substantial
disruption
of
interstate
commerce,
or
is
its
purpose
to
compel
the
federal
district
courts
to
assume
jurisdiction
of
the
trivial
monetary
controversies
arising
between
employees
and
employers,
over
wages,
vacation
benefits
and
related
manner
issues
which
traditionally
may
have
been
adjudicated
in
the
local
inferior
courts.
and
secondly,
the
proposition,
does
the
labor
management
relations
act
require
the
federal
district
courts
to
act
as
the
enforcement
and
collection
agency
of
every
grievance
award
throughout
our
land
regardless
of
the
minuteness
of
the
issue.
thus
in
substance,
making
every
grievance
award
tantamount
to
an
order
or
to
a
judgment
of
the
federal
court.
is
this
true
especially
as
in
this
case
where
there
is
no
binding
effect
where
there
is
no
finality
to
the
contract
in
question
as
well
as
the
grievance
procedure
outlined
therein.
third,
was
a
refusal
to
compel
or
there
was
a
refusal
to
employ
back
the
six
individual
petitioners
who
abandoned
their
post
voluntarily
in
order
to
participate
in
a
strike
justify
it
thus
failing
to
state
a
legal
cause
of
action
in
the
petitioner's
complaint
and
fourth
and
last,
what
state
court
jurisdiction
has
been
invoked?
is
there
concurrent
federal
jurisdiction
without
the
customary
removal
procedure?
i
feel
that
--
there
was
a
court
that
perhaps
one
of
the
outstanding
questions,
issues
here
today
is
solely
and
simply
as
this.
shall
this
court
give
to
the
federal
court
the
right
to
have
the
effect
or
to
give
to
the
effect
of
every
grievance
award
the
power
of
a
federal
order
or
federal
judgment.
now
the
pertinent
facts
are
briefed
in
this
situation.
as
mr.
previant
pointed
out
on
january
25,
1960,
the
six
individual
petitioners
were
employees
of
the
respondent.
the
union
at
philadelphia,
local
107,
the
same
international
union,
sent
them
some
of
its
own
members
to
the
local
terminal
on
the
morning
of
january
25,
1960.
and
these
individuals
from
philadelphia
commenced
carrying
and
displaying
conspicuously
strike
signs
with
reference
to
this
respondent.
without
any
notice
whatsoever,
in
contrary
to
various
and
different
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
these
six
individual
petitioners
immediately
abandoned
their
respective
post
of
employment.
early
in
the
morning,
they
left.
none
of
the
petitioners,
including
local
89
to
which
they
belonged,
sought
negotiations.
they
did
not
ask
for
settlement,
arbitration
as
provided
for
in
the
written
contract.
to
the
contrary,
these
six
individual
petitioners
went
to
the
outer
entrance
of
the
respondent's
terminal
and
proceed
to
and
did
march
back
and
forth
near
the
entrance
carrying
signs
captioned,
“local
89
on
strike”
and
“riss
there
is
a
strike”
and
physically
threatened
customers,
invitees
and
other
employees
of
the
respondent
in
acting
in
concert
with
each
other
did
strike,
commit
a
tort
and
work
stoppage,
all
of
which
are
continued
for
a
period
of
several
weeks
and
without
making
any
attempts
of
whatsoever
to
invoke
the
grievance
procedure
in
violation
of
the
contract.
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
if
your
honor
please,
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
the
--
it
is
true
that
there
was
no
evidence
taken
in
the
lower
court.
the
complaint
in
response
to
a
compliant
in
the
federal
court
and
answer
in
a
counterclaim
and
a
supplemental
answer
and
counterclaim
were
filed,
the
matter
of
which
was
verified.
in
the
state
court,
there
was
also
a
complaint
filed
which
was
verified
alleging
these
same
facts.
now,
there
has
been
no
reply
denying
these
facts.
however,
there
was
a
controverted
record
in
the
local
district
court
and
which
i
do
not
believe
was
a
part
of
this
official
record
in
which
we
controverted
the
claim
of
damages
as
the
respondent's
claimed
for
damages
on
the
counterclaim.
now,
mr.
logan
as
local
counsel
and
if
he
says
all
these
facts
were
controverted,
i
shall
defer
to
his
statement
because
i'm
sure
that
he
will
be
correct
about
it
that
there
is
no
reference
in
the
record
as
to
a
denial
of
these
allegations.
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
no,
sir
it
was
based
on
an
order
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
on
the
dismissal
of
what
facts
--
it
was
only
the
question
of
jurisdiction
raised
at
the
dismissal,
if
your
honor
pleases.
that
was
the
only
question
that
was
raised
in
order
of
dismissal.
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
no
sir,
if
your
honor
pleases,
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
law
that
the
allegations
in
the
pleadings
themselves
cannot
be
--
cannot
go
beyond
those
allegations
in
the
pleadings
themselves.
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
it's
my
understanding,
in
the
pleadings.
any
further
understanding
that
as
far
as
the
ground
rules
are
concerned
and
it
was
laid
in
their
jurisprudence
field
or
before
the
advent
of
the
opinion
was
perhaps
that
where
there
is
an
order
for
dismissal,
summary
judgment,
any
pleadings
which
have
not
been
--
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
no
sir.
that's
correct
sir.
it
is
an
order
of
dismissal
in
connection
with
that
point.
i
notice
on
page
22
of
petitioner's
brief
that
they
referred
to
the
[inaudible]
case
and
quoting,
it
says
that
we
cannot
make
findings
of
fact
different
from
the
allegations
of
the
pleadings
and
affidavits
upon
which
summary
judgment
or
dismissal
was
entered
below.
it
would
appear
from
that
statement
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
the
order
of
dismissal
or
from
the
summary
judgment
and
the
word
pleading
was
used
rather
than
just
a
complaint.
so
i
would
construe
from
their
citation
themselves
at
any
pleading,
any
fact,
any
allegation
and
any
pleading
in
the
record
which
is
not
controverted
or
which
is
not
the
matter
would
have
to
stand
on
its
own
face.
again,
i've
like
to
make
it
clear
in
fairness
to
mr.
logan
that
he
says
that
these
facts
were
controverted,
i
shall
refer
to
his
judgment.
in
continuing,
a
brief
with
the
factual
issue,
on
january
28,
63
days
after
this
incident
occurred
and
while
these
men
were
still
on
strike
line,
the
respondent
filed
a
suit
in
the
jefferson
county
kentucky
circuit
court
and
it
involves
the
same
issues,
the
same
people
and
all
of
the
petitioners
are
duly
before
that
court
and
they
have
filed
responsive
pleadings
and
the
restraining
order
was
entered.
now,
because
of
the
abandonment
of
their
post,
the
respondent
had
to
go
ahead
and
did
go
ahead
on
february
1st
and
make
arrangements
for
other
employees
to
carry
out
the
functions
of
those
who
had
left.
now,
these
individual
petitioners
and
there's
no
question
about
this
did
not
file
any
grievance
whatsoever.
they
did
not
bring
up
with
the
counsel
or
with
any
other
agency
desire
or
expressing
a
desire
to
have
grievance
arbitration
and
what
have
you,
they
left.
now,
the
only
time
the
grievance
came
about
was
on
february
the
15th
when
they
returned
after
pickets,
and
they
had
gone
back
to
philadelphia.
and
they
came
back,
these
six
petitioners
and
asked
to
be
replaced.
at
that
time,
the
respondent
advised
them
that
it
had
already
made
other
arrangements.
and
with
the
case
with
which
this
court's
[inaudible],
the
case
of
international
association
of
machinist,
lodge
1652,
versus
international
aircraft
service,
i
believe
this
is
in
their
brief,
a
citation
of
that
is
302
f.2d,
page
812
and
i
quote,
“it
is
a
well
set
of
rule
that
an
employer
may
fill
positions
left
vacant
by
employees
going
out
on
economic
strikes
and
that
he
is
not
later
bound
to
displace
men
hired
to
take
the
strikers
places
in
order
to
provide
positions
for
them”
and
they
cite
numerous
decisions
in
connection
with
that
case.
now,
insofar
as
the
argument
may
be
concerned,
i
feel
that
is
of
interest
to
this
court,
to
perhaps
look
back
just
a
tiny
bit
into
the
wording
and
to
get
a
general
overall
brief
understanding
of
this
act
which
we
are
confronted,
and
section
301
is
included
in
this
act.
now
reading
all,
the
labor
management
relations
act
as
amended,
produces
a
profound
and
an
articulate
realization
that
such
act
was
never
enacted
by
the
congress
for
the
purpose
of
settling
individual
monetary
disputes
between
employer
and
employee.
to
the
contrary,
we
observe
in
section
1
of
the
same
act
under
the
heading
of
a
short
title
and
declaration
of
policy
that
neither
labor
nor
management
“has
any
right
in
its
relations
with
any
other
to
engage
in
acts
or
practices
which
jeopardizes
the
public
health,
safety
or
interest.”
now
i
ask,
was
this
done
in
the
instant
case,
of
course
not.
now
the
same
session
provides
that
it's
the
purpose
and
policy
of
the
act
to
provoke
the
full
flow
of
commerce
and
to
deal
with
situations
“which
affect
commerce
and
are
inimical
to
the
general
welfare
and
to
protect
the
right
of
the
public
in
connection
with
labor
disputes
affecting
commerce.”
also,
section
101
of
the
same
act,
it
says
that
and
i
quote,
“it
is
here
by
declared
to
be
the
policy
of
the
united
states
to
eliminate
the
causes
of
certain,
substantial,”
this
word
“substantial”
is
used
in
various
places
throughout
this
act,
“substantial
destructions
to
the
free
flow
of
commerce
and
to
mitigate
and
eliminate
these
obstructions.”
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
sir?
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
yes
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
mr.
justice
goldberg,
had
there
been
a
neutral
and
impartial
arbitrator
selected,
mutually
and
jointly
by
the
parties
hereto
this
respondent
would
have
lived
up
to
that
adjudication
and
would
not
have
been
here
today.
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
there
would
be
no
question
whatsoever,
sir.
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
yes
sir,
i
feel
that
is
all
it
is.
the
main
question,
mr.
justice
goldberg
is
first,
is
a
grievance
award,
that
is
the
grievance
award
of
a
local
level,
state
level,
binding,
does
it
have
the
effect
of
the
federal
order
or
a
judgment
or
is
there
a
--
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
but
it
does
--
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
yes
sir,
if
there
was
an
outside
arbitrator.
this,
your
honor,
if
[inaudible]
ahead
a
moment
ago
when
you
reached
and
questioned
about
this
umpire
handling.
on
page
9
here,
the
section
f
to
an
umpire
for
decision,
that
is
what
the
parties
had
in
mind
if
they
arrived
at
the
point
where
they
themselves,
this
is
an
interfamily.
this
grievance
award
is
merely
a
vehicle
by
which
the
parties
themselves
in
their
own
families
try
to
work
it
out
and
which
is
--
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that,
but
they
realized
and
they
recognized
from
reading
this
contract
and
this
court
will
too
by
looking
over
that
they
realized
their
inadequacies
that
mr.
previant
has
pointed
out.
and
if
they
get
to
a
point
where
they
cannot
agree,
then
this
umpire
handling
or
arbitration,
formal
arbitration
which
this
court
has
held
time
after
time
is
enforceable
by
the
federal
court.
but
this
court
has
never
held
to
my
knowledge
that
a
grievance
award,
a
true
grievance
award
and
as
this
court
knows
or
at
least
in
this
situation,
lawyers
and
parties
are
not
permitted
at
this
local
level
conferences
where
they
get
together.
they
are
not
based
or
they're
not
fashioned
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
they
are
prepared
for
the
people
who
get
together
and
they
work
it
out,
they
enter
an
order,
but
there
is
a
great
difference
between
the
arbitration
award
and
the
grievance
award.
the
arbitration
award
is
won
where
the
parties
mutually
agree
that
they
will
have
federal
mission
--
mediation
board,
american
arbitration
association
or
some
other
capable
person
to
come
in
and
to
listen
to
their
dispute
and
permit
counsel
to
present
the
facts
for
consideration.
they
and
that
has
the
effect
of
a
binding
agreement,
but
this
here,
your
honor
will
note
provides
section
8
of
the
contract
and
section
8
of
the
contract
going
on
down
a
little
bit
farther,
mr.
justice
goldberg
pointed
out
a
moment
ago,
there
is
no
binding
agreement
upon
the
decision
of
the
joint
area
of
decision.
it
is
not
pointed
--
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
yes
sir.
oh,
incidentally,
this
contract,
the
copy
of
the
entire
contract
was
filed
with
a
complaint.
and
i
understood
that
it
was
made
a
part,
the
contracts
made
a
part
of
the
record
and
went
to
the
sixth
circuit
and
also
to
the
record
here.
but
in
the
transcript
itself,
the
section
to
which
i
refer
is
subsection
g
on
page
9
of
the
record.
now,
let
us
see
and
this
is
what
destroys
or
one
of
the
things
that
destroys
the
finality
or
the
binding
effect
of
this
contract.
this
provides
that
the
failure
of
any
joint
committee
to
meet
without
fault,
the
complainant
said,
“refusal
of
either
party
to
submit
or
to
appear
at
the
grievance
procedure
at
any
stage
or,
undermined,
failure
to
comply
with
any
filed
decision
withdraws
the
benefits
of
article
viii.”
in
other
words,
if
either
party
fails
to
comply
then
the
union
has
its
right
to
economic
recourse,
to
strike
or
to
picket
and
they
have,
i
assure
you,
relied
upon
that
because
more
than
two
years,
august
1960
up
to
the
present
time,
they
have
relied
upon
that
because
it
had
pickets
in
front
of
respondent's
terminal
in
louisville
and
they
are
there
today
unless
they
withdrawn
this
morning
or
last
night.
so,
that
is
not
binding
upon
either
of
the
parties.
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
yes,
we
feel
that
the
respondent
feels
that
under
this
particular
situation
that
this
contract
was
breached
in
its
entirety.
when
these
men
left
their
positions
without
any
request
for
arbitration
and
joined
the
picket
line
that
breached
the
whole
thing
because
i
have
to
point
your
honor
also
that
on
the
next
page,
page
--
though
the
--
apparent
to
that
is
not
in
this
record
here.
the
page
or
the
following
page
--
subsection
h
of
the
--
of
this
particular
contract,
page
24
of
the
record
provides
--
yes,
subsection
h.
down
at
the
bottom
of
page
24,
subsection
h
down
at
the
bottom,
nothing
herein
shall
prevent
legal
proceedings
by
the
employer
where
the
strike
is
in
violation
of
this
agreement.
we
have
pleaded.
we
have
alleged
that
the
strike
was
in
violation
of
the
agreement.
we
have
pointed
out,
it
was
on
page
9
of
the
record
and
i'd
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
this
part
that
says,
“its
article
viii,
the
unions
and
the
employers
agree
that
there
should
be
no
strike,
lockout
or
illegal
proceedings
without
first
using
all
possible
means
of
the
settlement
as
provided
for
in
this
agreement
of
any
controversy
which
might
arise.”
and
then
following
that,
dispute
shall
first
be
taken
up
between
the
employer
and
the
local
union
involved
failing
adjust,”
but
then
they
go
ahead
through
this
grievous
procedure.
so
we
will
submit
that
these
provisions
of
this
contract
have
not
been
complied
with
by
the
sixth
circuit.
in
our
brief
to
the
sixth
circuit,
i
would
like
to
mention
in
fairness
to
the
record
concerned
that
the
question
was
raised
on
page
8
and
which
is
not
a
part
of
your
record
here,
assumed
of
the
brief
which
was
filed
there,
but
question
of
reaching
of
this
contract
was
raised
and
the
sixth
circuit
in
pursuance
of
it,
went
ahead
and
held
that
this
contract
was
not
a
finality,
it
was
not
a
final
thing,
this
contract
here
because
the
theory
of
it
is
quiet
apparent.
if
these
two
parties
themselves
cannot
agree
upon
a
binding
contract,
they
reserve
the
right
there,
either
one
pulls
out,
they
don't
appear
then
it's
not
but
a
binding
performance
of
either
of
them.
the
economic
recourse
may
be
had
or
legal
procedures
maybe
instituted
by
the
employer.
so,
if
these
two
parties
themselves
have
agreed
that
there
shall
not
be
a
binding
contract
between
the
two
of
them,
then
i
will
submit
to
the
court
that
it
is
not
equitable
for
if
the
petitioner
or
them
to
ask
this
court
to
make
a
binding
agreement
for
them.
it
is
certainly
incongruous
and
inconsistent
and
will
not
hold
water,
but
this
last
point
which
--
the
last
provision
of
the
contract
which
we
refer
is
one
mentioned
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
its
decision.
it
held,
yes,
they
respect
the
right
for
these
employees
not
to
cross
a
picket
line,
but
there
is
another
section
of
that
same
section,
other
subsection
of
article
ix
and
that
is
on
page
--
record
is
on
page
20.
apparently,
the
article
ix
is
not
in
the
record.
and
i
don't
know
how
that
occurred,
but
i've
searched
my
own
folder,
it
is
not,
but
the
article
ix
was
referred
to
in
a
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
and
it
quotes,
“it
quotes
it
and
so
it
is
in
the
record
and
i
quote
this
portion
of
it
which
it
must
read
into
the
record
with
which
is
before
the
court.”
we're
talking
about
these
employees
where
they
say
that
they
did
not
have
to
cross
the
picket
line.
and
this
is
the
section
which
the
sixth
circuit
read
into
it,
had
to
read
with
the
other
one
to
get
the
full
meaning.
the
insistence
by
any
employer,
that
his
employee
handle
unfair
goods
or
go
through
the
picket
line
after
they
have
elected
not
to
and
if
such
refusal,
--
refusal
has
been
approved
in
writing
by
the
responsible
officials
of
the
central
states
driver's
counsel
shall
be
sufficient
cause
for
an
immediate
of
striking
of
all
such
employers
operations
without
any
need
of
the
union
to
go
through
the
grievance
procedure
herein.
now
there
is
no
allegation
that
that
was
complied
with.
there
could
not
be
an
allegation
because
it
was
not
complied
with.
so,
in
view
of
that,
it
destroys
completely
and
wholly
the
breadth,
the
vitality
of
this
collective
bargain
agreement
if
it
is
one
but
i
doubt
it,
it
is
a
binding
one.
the
court
has
said
there
is
no
finality
to
it
because
either
party
can
get
out
of
it.
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
we
have
pleaded
that
as
--
your
honor
has
pointed
out,
we
have
pleaded
that,
and
the
court
of
--
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
it
was
a
degree
of
finality.
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
yes
sir.
the
classical
arbitration
had
that
been
here
again
mr.
goldberg,
we
would
not
be
here
if
there
had
been
in
this
case
a
classical
arbitration.
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
in
chicago?
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
if
your
honor
please,
i
did
not
have
that
place
here.
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
oh,
it
would
be
hearsay.
it's
not
in
the
record.
i
understand
that
there
were
two
employees
and
if
they
could
not
discuss
the
facts
at
length
if
they
wanted
to.
if
that
is
referred
back
to
the
district
court
for
trial
which
i
hope
will
not
be,
we
would
introduce
it
through
to
the
fact
that
it
was
a
mere
sham
up
there,
also.
and
i
know
that
would
be
contrary
by
my
worthy
adversaries
here
but
that
would
be
one
thing,
but
gentlemen,
as
far
as
this
question
of
this
contract
is
concerned,
i
would
like
to
refer
the
attention
of
this
court
to
a
previous
decision
and
which
i
believe
would
be
appropriate
here.
the
same
wording
this
grievance
has
pointed
out
of
the
same
type
of
contract
has
been
included
in
the
yellow
transit
case.
and
in
that
case
mr.
justice
brennan,
they've
announced
the
opinion
and
in
that
case,
in
referring
to
this
article
viii,
the
question
arose
as
to
whether
there
was
a
binding
contract
there
for
arbitration.
the
wording
is
either
identical
or
extremely
comparable
and
this
is
the
statement
of
this
court
and
its
opinion,
“since
it
is
clear
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
involved
in
this
case
does
not
bind
either
party
to
arbitrate
any
dispute,
we
agree
that
no
injunction
should
be
granted.”
that
is
the
decision
of
this
court
in
a
recent
case,
also
the
case
of
hoover
motor
express
company
versus
the
same
union
in
217
f.2d
49.
they
held
that
the
contract,
the
same
contract
which
we
have
here
before
us,
the
wording
is
identical,
did
not
contain
an
arbitration
clause,
it
must
be
mutual.
there
is
no
binding
effect
upon
either
party
to
submit
to
classical
or
formal
arbitration
under
the
terms
of
this
particular
contract
because
it
must
be
mutual.
so
therefore,
there
is
not
a
binding
effect
as
far
as
this
contract
might
be
concerned.
the
sixth
circuit
injected
based
upon
the
briefs
or
at
least
upon
the
respondent's
brief,
this
question
of
whether
they
had
the
right
to
go
off
their
jobs,
participate
in
the
strike
and
then
come
back.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
to
the
court
that
if
this
grievance
award
were
given
legal
effect,
it
would
mean
that
every
grievance
award
upon
the
local
level
involving
thousands
and
thousands
of
unions
and
people
would
have
the
same
effect
if
on
the
local
level,
they
entered
into
a
grievance
award
and
take
it
to
a
federal
court
and
then
it
would
go
ahead
and
be
the
same
or
tantamount
to
a
ruling
of
the
federal
court.
i
do
not
believe
as
what
congress
had
in
mind.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
was
this
court
has
in
mind
at
all,
because
we
know
as
this
court
point
out
of
the
westinghouse
case
that
nowhere
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
ever
show
any
recognition
of
this
type
of
suit.
my
time
has
just
about
gone.
insofar
as
this
evening
news
case
is
concerned,
i'd
like
to
address
the
court's
attention
to
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black
in
which
he
gives
an
excellent
evaluation
in
which
i'll
not
try
to
repeat
but
he
states
that
in
order
for
this
court
decide
whether
the
suit
brought
from
this
case
is
one
of
the
types
which
an
in
--
that
individual
can
bring.
one
thing
is
certain,
that
case
held
that
the
state
courts
have
concurrent
jurisdiction.
the
state
court
assumed
jurisdiction
of
this
very
case
and
is
still
pending
in
jefferson
county
circuit
court
of
louisville,
kentucky.
it's
still
pending.
it
was
filed
first,
it's
filed
before
the
grievance
was
ever
invoked
so
--
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
yes
sir,
it
involves
the
same
issues
and
the
same
parties
--
mr.
h.
bemis
lawrence
yes,
we're
the
plaintiff,
you're
right
again
mr.
justice
stewart,
exactly
right.
in
conclusion,
members
of
the
court,
i
know
that
this
evening
news
association
case
has
been
decided
since
the
summation
of
my
brief.
i
can
appreciate
the
issues
involved.
what
the
evening
news
case
has
held,
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
black
that
perhaps
i'm
on
the
same
dilemma,
maybe
he
is,
but
one
thing
is
certain,
this
evening
news
case
gives
no
precedent
for
the
facts
involved
in
this
case
authority
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
pursuant
to
the
rules
of
the
court
or
you
want
to
get
an
early
decision
of
this
but
if
you
give
the
respondent
10
days
to
file
a
supplemental
brief
and
the
petitioners
10
additional
days
to
comment
upon
the
fact,
we
feel
that
this
case
has,
well,
it
would
be
very
much
appreciated.
in
that
way,
in
20
days,
we'd
have
both
the
supplemental
briefs
in.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
yesterday,
mr.
justice
goldberg
referred
in
a
very
appropriate
analogy
to
history
and
to
logic,
i
would
like
to
use
that
same
phrase
here
this
morning
[inaudible]
that
there
has
been
no
history,
no
conversional
history
in
the
background
of
this
legislation
to
indicate
that
this
type
of
a
case
was
ever
intended
to
be
turned
lose
upon
our
united
state
district
courts.
from
a
logical
standpoint,
i
submit,
with
all
the
sincerity
at
my
command,
that
if
this
type
of
case
were
presented
to
our
federal
courts
that
only
catastrophic
results
would
be
had
and
chaos
and
confusion
would
be
the
in
line.
