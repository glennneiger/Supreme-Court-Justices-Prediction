mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
proceeding
comes
from
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit
by
certiorari.
it
involves
the
specific
question
of
whether
a
seaman
who
has
brought
a
maintenance
and
cure
claim
appended
to
a
jones
act
negligence
claim
arising
out
of
the
same
incident,
the
same
employment,
and
the
same
injuries
is
or
is
not
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury
of
the
issues
relating
to
the
maintenance
and
cure
claim.
in
the
court
below,
it
was
denied
to
him
and
we
are
be
--
on
behalf
of
a
petition
on
the
ground
that
he
was
entitled
to
that
trial
by
jury
and
that
it
was
improperly
denied
to
him.
as
the
court
may
note
from
the
caption,
the
plaintiff,
mr.
andres
san
martin
died
during
the
pendency
of
the
appeal
and
his
administrator,
the
public
administrator
of
the
county
of
new
york
was
substituted
and
that
is
why
the
caption
reads
the
way
it
does.
he
was
alive
during
the
time
of
trial
and
testified.
now,
very
briefly,
the
facts,
as
they
may
relate
to
the
legal
question
before
the
court,
was
that
the
petitioner
or
the
intestate
alleged
that
on
november
5,
1954,
while
an
ordinary
seaman
aboard
the
ship
of
the
respondent,
he
was
directed
over
his
own
objection
and
that
of
other
seamen
to
carry
a
100-pound
drum
of
cement
up
an
inclined
gangway
from
the
pier
to
the
ship.
but
this
gangway
was
not
secure,
that
he
--
as
he
was
going
up
the
gangway
with
this
100-pound
drum
of
cement
on
his
shoulder,
lost
his
balance,
wrenched
his
back,
and
suffered
severe
injuries.
at
the
end
of
the
voyage
in
december,
he
left
the
ship
with
master
certificate,
and
went
to
the
united
states
public
health
service
hospital
in
staten
island,
new
york.
he
was
treated
there,
became
an
in-patient,
and
remained
an
in-patient
until
march
1,
1955,
a
period
of
about
--
approximately
three
months.
he
was
discharged
from
that
hospital
marked
“not
fit
for
duty”
with
the
diagnosis
of
a
herniated
disc
and
another
notation
that
he
had
received
maximum
hospital
benefits.
he
filed
suit
in
june
of
1955.
the
case
came
to
trial
in
may
of
1960
in
the
southern
district.
at
that
time,
when
it
finally
became
time,
that
i
will
go
into
later,
for
the
maintenance
and
cure
testimony
to
be
presented,
the
defendant's
physician,
orthopedic
specialist,
claimed
that
mr.
san
martin
could
not
receive
any
further
curative
care
and
that
when
he
was
discharged
on
march
1,
1955,
his
condition
was
such
that
he
would
not
benefit
in
any
way
from
any
further
medical
care.
the
plaintiffs,
the
petitioner's
physician,
who
happened
to
be
the
former-chief
of
the
orthopedic
service
of
the
very
marine
hospital
from
which
this
man
had
been
discharged,
testified
to
the
contrary.
this
was
all
to
the
court
alone
since
the
jury
trial
had
been
denied
on
these
issues.
at
the
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes,
your
honor.
and,
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner's
physician
was
that
he
should
have
received
conservative
treatment,
received
the
brace,
there
is
other
medical
treatment
that
this
would
not
only
have
provided
a
cure
in
terms
of
relief
from
pain
and
suffering
but
would
have
removed
him
from
the
ranks
of
total
disability
which
is
where
he
remained
throughout
these
five
years
and
would
have
made
him
able
to
accept
gainful
employment
of
a
non-arduous
nature
such
as
an
elevator
operator
or
an
assembler
of
parts
or
things
of
that
nature.
now
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
it's
a
little
longer
than
the
normal
at
that
time.
the
southern
district
is
much
less
congested
now.
the
waiting
period
--
my
own
experience,
limited
as
it
may
be
was
--
is
that,
now,
three
years,
it's
the
normal
waiting
period,
approximately
two
years
from
the
filing
of
note
of
issue
but
that
can't
be
done
until
all
free
trial
discovery
is
completed.
it
averages
about
a
year,
i
would
say
three
years.
at
that
time,
it
was
longer.
your
honors
may
be
familiar
that
numerous
just
--
judges
have
been
appointed
recently
and
that's
cut
down
the
waiting
period.
now,
as
is
clear
from
the
opinions
on
the
record,
the
district
court
judge
decided
this
factual
issue
against
the
plaintiff
and
accepted
in
full
the
testimony
of
the
defendant's
physician
that
there
was
no
curative
treatment
available
to
the
man.
and
so,
without
going
to
the
facts
anymore,
now
reverting
to
legal
question,
i
think
the
record
establishes
that
the
seeking
by
the
petitioner
of
a
trial
by
jury
related
to
some
very
substantial
monetary
issues
to
him,
the
outstanding
maintenance
and
cure
for
the
five
years
that
it
intervened
as
well
as,
as
is
noted
from
his
complaint,
he
sought
damages
for
the
failure
to
properly
pay
him
the
maintenance
and
cure
when
it
was
due
and
of
course,
this
court
has
held
many
times
that
maintenance
and
cure
is
due
when
it
is
due,
that
is
the
very
day
that
he
is
ill,
the
very
day
that
he
would
and
should
receive
curative
treatment
and
does
not.
and,
again,
this
amount
was
substantial
because
the
petitioner
could
have
shown
that
he
not
only
lost
the
$8
a
day
but
the
employment
and
the
earnings
that
he
would
have
had,
had
he
been
able
to
obtain
gainful
employment
which
he
would've
been
able
to
obtain
according
to
his
physicians
having
received
the
medical
treatment
to
which
he
was
entitled
and
which
the
shipowner
denied
to
him,
although,
without
question,
there
had
been
a
due
demand
by
june
of
1955
when
the
complaint
was
filed.
that
of
course,
is
on
the
record.
i
think,
if
i
may
speak
to
the
facts
of
life,
we
all
know
that
the
demand
in
fact
had
been
made
earlier,
the
seaman's
condition
was
known
to
the
shipowner,
it
happened
aboard
the
ship,
he
received
the
master
certificate
and
they,
in
fact,
had
paid
him
a
very
small
amount,
some
$32
in
maintenance
and
cure
in
the
intervening
period
and
then
had
cut
him
off.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
the
maintenance
is
during
that
period.
the
cure
relates
to
the
cost
of
the
medical
care.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
frequently
now,
obtains
free
of
charge
from
the
united
states
public
health
service
but
not
always.
the
maintenance
refers
to
$8
a
day
which
is
agreed
upon
throughout
the
industry
as
the
board
and
lodging,
the
“keep”
as
sometimes
called
in
old
maritime
cases.
during
the
period
that
he's
receiving
the
cure,
the
medical
care,
he
gets
upkeep
of
$8
a
day
for
maintenance.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
it's
now
the
adopted
in
agreement
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes,
your
honor.
and
again,
in
my
experience,
even
in
those
cases
where
the
nmu,
the
national
maritime
union
contract
isn't
in
effect,
it's
almost
stipulated
by
counsel
rather
than
calling
him
“home
economist”
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
to
testify
what
might
be
the
reason
of
that.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
no,
not
while
he's
an
in-patient
because
he's
being
maintained
inside
the
hospital
which
--
if
it's
free,
it's
there
and
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
the
period
that
petitioner
alleges
would
be
from
the
time
of
march
1,
1955
when
he
no
longer
was
an
in-patient,
right
through
to
the
time
of
trial.
he
never
became
an
in-patient
again.
and
then
we
reached
the
problems
that
this
court
recently
noted
in
the
salem
case
of
whether
any
amount
should
ever
be
allowed
for
the
time
after
trial.
as
i
understand
the
rule,
if
it
is
very,
very
clear
and
certain
as
to
what
amount
should
be
allowed
for
the
period
after
trial,
the
court
may
allow
it.
otherwise,
it
should
refrain
from
allowing
it
for
any
period
after
the
trial.
but
certainly,
the
claim
was
in
may
12,
1960
when
this
case
came
for
trial,
something
over
five
years
of
maintenance,
so
it
was
a
substantial
claim
in
addition
to
the
other
elements
involved,
the
loss
of
employment
and
earnings.
now,
on
the
legal
issue,
the
question
framed
on
the
writ
of
certiorari,
i
submit
that
there
has
been
literally
no
question
that
it
is
desirable
on
all
of
the
policy
considerations
that
a
joint
trial
be
held.
i
note
that
--
in
the
briefs,
we
submit
the
writings
of
learned
commentators
and
as
i
see
it,
there
is
not
a
learned
commentator
who
has
devoted
time
and
energy
and
scholarship
to
this
question
but
has
not
reached
the
conclusion
that
this
is
indeed
the
desirable
result
that
when
a
jones
act
claim
or
when
a
seaman
comes
before
a
court
and
relates
that
he
has
been
injured,
relates
that
negligence
or
unseaworthiness
has
caused
his
injury
and
presents
all
his
medical
testimony
that
the
efficient
affair,
the
proper
way
to
proceed,
if
possible,
would
be
to
allow
the
same
jury
to
determine
what
maintenance
and
cure
payments
he
should
receive.
and
so,
i
will
not
speak
at
this
point
to
any
extent
as
to
the
question
for
what
--
this
is
the
desired
result.
in
fact,
even
below,
the
only
voice
of
all
the
opinions
and
commentators
that
have
spoken
on
the
subject
that
has
suggested
that
a
joint
jury
trial
should
not
be
allowed,
that
it
suggested
that
the
question
now
before
the
court
should
be
answered
in
the
negative
is
the
opinion
of
judge
friendly
of
the
circuit
court
on
behalf
of
only
four
of
the
nine
members
of
the
second
circuit
who
heard
this
matter
en
banc.
and
even
he
concludes
that
this
indeed
would
be
desirable
to
have
a
joint
jury
trial.
in
other
words,
the
question
now
before
this
court
should
be
answered
in
the
affirmative,
if
at
all
possible.
so,
i
now
turn,
if
i
may,
to
what
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
i
do,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
the
reason
is
this.
in
fact,
there
was
diversity
of
citizenship.
in
fact,
this
man
was
a
resident
of
the
state
of
new
york.
he
was
a
citizen,
as
the
record
shows,
either
of
spain
where
he
was
born
or
of
new
york
where
he
resided.
in
fact,
he
had
become
a
naturalized
citizen
in
1943.
this
appears
in
the
depositions
but
not
in
the
trial
record,
but
on
the
trial
record
appears
the
fact
that
he
was
born
in
spain
and
lived
for
a
long
time
in
new
york.
so,
he's
either
--
from
the
trial
record,
a
citizen
of
new
york
or
spain.
the
defendant
on
his
pleadings,
was
a
resi
--
was
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
new
jersey,
was
in
any
case
a
citizen
not
of
the
state
of
new
york.
it
was
a
foreign
corporation,
not
an
alien
but
a
foreign
corporation.
and
therefore,
diversity
of
citizenship
existed.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
this
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
i
then
reach
this
proposition,
your
honor,
if
i
understand
the
point
we're
at.
a
maintenance
and
cure
claim,
if
diversity
of
citizenship
exists,
i
submit
is
entitled
--
it
is
--
they
affirmed
it,
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury
in
the
federal
court.
now,
i
submit
the
following
that
a
maintenance
and
cure
claim
may
enter
the
federal
court
on
one
of
two
grounds.
it
may
approach
through
the
exercise
of
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
in
article
3
of
the
constitution
and
28
title
1333,
and
it
--
there
appears
as
a
maritime
--
as
an
admiralty
claim,
historically,
not
entitled
to
a
jury.
but
a
plaintiff
may
appear
as
he
so
desires
not
that
way
but
claiming
it
as
a
common
law
right
which
would
be
entitled
to
a
jury
in
the
state
court.
but
is
he
entitled,
and
that
brings
us
to
the
question,
to
bring
a
state
claim?
he
is,
if
diversity
of
citizenship
exists.
and
then
he
appears
in
court
under
1332
of
title
28
and
under
the
exercise
of
diversity
of
citizenship,
if
he
were
entitled
to
a
jury
in
the
state
court,
he
is
clearly
entitled
to
a
jury
in
the
federal
court.
or,
he
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
this
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
discussed
in
the
opinion
below.
there
are
numerous
cases
cited
there
of
this
court
and
it
has
been
conclusively
held
that
in
the
state
courts,
a
trial
by
jury
as
a
common
law
matter,
is
permitted
for
maintenance
and
cure
claims
and
has
been
regularly
allowed.
i
might
call
this
attention
--
the
court
to
its
own
opinions
in
leon
v.
galceran,
in
the
garrett
v.
moore-mccormack
case
which
is
a
more
recent
case,
rather
often
quoted
in
this
area.
there
was
a
trial
by
jury
in
the
pennsylvania
court.
it
so
happen
that
the
pennsylvania
court
applied
a
state
rule
as
to
the
burden
of
proof
on
release
and
this
court
took
the
question
and
pointed
out
that
they
must
apply
the
federal
maritime
rule.
but
recognizing
without
any
disapproval
or
question
whatsoever,
that
it
was
a
properly
submitted
question,
the
maintenance
and
cure
claim
is
a
$1000
verdict
for
maintenance
and
cure
in
the
garrett
case
in
the
pennsylvania
court.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
that
question
of
course,
would
lie
to
what
has
been
the
state
procedure
in
the
past.
and
i
would
submit
that
a
study
of
this
will
show
that,
throughout
the
years,
the
state
courts
have
allowed
and
grant
the
juries
on
these
state
--
on
these
maintenance
and
cure
claims
when
brought
as
a
simple
claim
for
money
in
personam
against
the
shipowner
for
money
damages.
it
is
in
fact
the
--
almost
the
simplest
type
of
common
law
in
personam
claim
in
which
the
man
comes
in
and
seeks
money
against
the
shipowner,
over
whom
he
has
obtained
in
personam
jurisdiction,
which
was
--
what
was
obtained
here.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
i
would
say
this,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
in
leon
v.
galceran,
decided
in
i
think
approximately
1893,
the
specific
issue
was
wages,
but
wages
is
maintenance
and
cure.
there's
no
issue
about
that.
this
court
has
said
so
i
think
in
pacific
v.
peterson,
pointed
out
that
wages
consists
of
maintenance
and
cure
as
it
were.
it
consists
of
three
items:
maintenance,
cure,
and
wages
--
beyond
our
wages.
and
there,
it
was
specifically
held
by
this
court
that
the
claim
for
wages
was
within
the
savings
clause,
was
a
common
law
remedy,
was
entitled
to
a
jury
resolution.
i
may
point
now
this
court's
attention
to
the
extensive
scholarly
discussion
in
mr.
chief
justice
stone's
decision
in
madruga
which
is
cited
in
our
reply
brief
and
there,
it
is
comprehensively
noted
in
the
footnotes
the
fact
--
excuse
me,
it's
mr.
justice
black's
decision
in
madruga.
i'm
very
sorry.
that
the
jury
trials
were
allowed
on
these
common
law
claims.
also
in
fact,
if
i
may
borrow
from
my
learned
adversary's
brief,
in
the
very
case
he
cite,
henry
v.
moore
in
which
mr.
chief
justice
stone
wrote
an
extensive
opinion
and
the
issue
there
was
an
in
rem
proceeding
in
the
state
courts
but
in
the
scholarly
discussion
that
appears
there,
they
have
numerous
cases
cited,
a
numerous
discussion
of
all
of
the
old
law
on
this
issue
that
state
courts
regularly
treat
these
maritime
claims
and
rightfully
grant
juries
on
them.
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
maritime
does
not
deny
a
jury
resolution
of
the
issues
in
the
state
courts,
and
the
opinion
below
in
this
court,
in
the
second
circuit
in
this
case,
fully
accepted
that
fact.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
you
could
not
--
the
petitioner,
a
seaman,
could
not
get
into
the
federal
court
absent
diversity
and
absent
pending
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
--
to
a
substantial
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
he
couldn't
get
in
the
door
except
through
1333,
the
admiralty
court
jurisdiction.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
absolutely.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
right.
or
you
could,
of
course,
attempt
to
invoke
rule
39
(c)
of
the
frcp
and
seek
an
advisory
jury
to
the
discretion
of
the
court,
but
we
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
i
can
only
say,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
i
was
relatively
heartbroken
that
the
court
did
not
--
below
did
not
invoke
that
discretion
and
power
that
it
have.
i
don't
even
know
if
it's
discretionary.
i
see
it
that
the
court
had
to,
and
when
it
was
for
--
and
that
was
cited
to
the
court,
the
brooks
v.
yawkey
case
to
the
first
circuit
which
point
out
that
even
when
the
case
is
pending
on
appeal,
a
court
may
and
should
amend
the
pleadings
to
bring
the
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
the
fact
that
--
starting
from
the
respondent's
side,
the
fact
that
the
respondent
was
not
a
citizen
of
new
york,
so
that
the
first
hurdle
was
acquired
was
--
or
the
second
hurdle,
however
you
look
at
it,
that
appeared
from
the
pleading
right
from
the
outset.
the
fact
that
the
petitioner's
intestate,
the
plaintiff,
was
a
citizen
of
new
york
or
of
spain
but
in
any
case,
diverse
from
the
defendant,
appeared
during
the
course
of
his
testimony
on
the
first
day
of
trial
when
he
testified
that
he
came
from
spain
and
that
he
resided
in
new
york,
and
that
appears
in
the
record
here
and
that
was
testimony
taken
on
the
first
day
of
trial.
i
may
also
say,
because
this
was
--
i
may
also
say
that
i
submit
respectfully
that
it
was
brought
to
the
court's
attention
--
the
trial
court's
attention,
perhaps
implicitly
rather
than
explicitly,
when
i
argue
to
the
--
to
judge
levitt,
district
judge
levitt,
and
appears
on
page
89
of
the
brief,
that
this
man
could've
brought
his
proceeding
in
the
state
court
on
a
common
law
basis.
in
the
state
court,
it
would've
been
entitled
to
a
jury.
i
think
implicit
within
that
was
that,
since
i
was
referring
to
the
state
law
and
what
it
would've
been
entitled
to
in
the
state
law,
i
was
referring
to
the
diversity
of
citizenship
and
the
rights
under
erie
v.
tompkins
which
would
grow
there
from.
and
i
think
that
implicitly
in
that
argument
was
already
brought
to
the
court's
attention
the
fact
that
there
was
a
diversity
of
citizenship
vaguely
but
explicitly
as
to
the
facts
of
citizenship,
certainly
the
first
day
of
trial
revealed
the
plaintiff's
situation
and
the
pleadings
had
already
been
before
the
court
as
to
the
defendant.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
only
in
the
--
on
the
appeal
before
the
circuit
court
or
when
the
brief
was
filed
to
the
circuit
court,
the
brief
contained
a
discussion
of
this
issue
and
stated
to
the
circuit
court
that
we
are
prepared
and
ready
to
amend
the
pleadings
if
such
be
necessary.
we
noted
the
brooks
v.
yawkey
case
of
the
first
circuit
where
the
court
had
pointed
out
that
it's
not
necessary
to
amend
the
pleading
just
so
long
as
the
fact
of
diversity
is
brought
to
the
court's
attention
then
the
court
will
allow
a
pro
forma
motion
after
the
opinion
is
rendered.
and
so,
we
brought
to
the
court's
attention
that
fact
and
assume
that
the
brooks
v.
yawkey
decision
would
be
followed.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
i
would
submit
that
he
had
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes,
i
would
submit
that
and
i
would
say
even
further,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
if
i
may,
that
i
don't
think,
dealing
with
this
basic
and
cherished
procedural
right,
as
mr.
justice
clark
--
as
judge
clark
called
it
below,
that
it
is
--
that
this
can
turn
either
on
whether
i,
as
counsel,
mentioned
it
to
judge
levitt
below.
i
think
that
if
the
fact
of
diversity
of
citizenship
existed
then
the
jurisdictional
principle
must
apply
just
that
the
reverse
side
of
the
coin,
supposing
diversity
of
citizenship
hadn't
in
fact
existed
and,
for
some
reason
or
other,
this
case
was
in
court
on
diversity
of
citizenship.
would
it
depend
on
whether
counsel
called
it
to
the
court's
attention?
clearly
not.
many
courts,
this
court
too
has
held
that
absent
diversity,
the
sword
must
fall,
the
case
must
go
out.
i
think
that
the
sword
has
two
sides
but
in
any
case,
as
i
submit,
it
was
called
to
the
court's
attention.
of
course,
as
i
say,
as
we
have
argued
in
our
briefs,
we
don't
realize
solely
on
the
diversity
of
citizenship.
we
think
that
as
a
matter
of
fundamental
policy
in
appended
jurisdiction
argument
should
be
evoked
in
the
main
brief
and
perhaps
more
extensively
developed
in
the
reply
brief,
if
i
may
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
discussion
there
that
we're
fully
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
below.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
a
couple
of
points
and
particularly
to
point
out
the
following.
the
petitioner
here
appeared
and
entered
the
federal
court
through
the
state
door.
granted,
he
had
the
right
to
come
in
through
the
admiralty
door.
he
chose
to
come
in
through
the
state
door.
by
coming
in
to
the
state
door,
and
i'll
speak
in
a
moment
of
simler
v.
conner
and
its
effects
on
this
situation.
but
holding
that
to
a
side
for
the
moment,
i
submit
that
this
court
has
held
on
numerous
occasions,
and
i
refer
specifically
to
the
decision
of
mr.
justice
black
in
madruga
against
the
superior
court
of
california,
and
noted
that
in
admiralty
matters,
notwithstanding
the
constitution,
article
3
seems
to
suggest
that
there
is
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
admiralty
matters.
what
really
is
the
fact
is
that
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts
and
of
the
federal
courts.
accordingly,
this
petitioner
was
within
his
rights
to
claim
and
he
is
within
his
rights
here
and
now
to
argue
to
this
honorable
court,
that
he
had
a
state
common
law
right,
notwithstanding
that
it
is
an
event
that
occurred
on
the
navigable
waters
and
is
in
that
sense,
drenched
with
the
maritime.
there
is
a
common
law
and
a
long
history
of
common
law
claims,
notwithstanding
it
comes
from
the
maritime.
the
only
maritime
exclusively
admiralty
and
maritime
proceeding
that
exists,
as
was
held
in
madruga
and
in
other
cases,
are
the
in
rem
proceedings
against
the
offending
vessel
or
thing
and
in
personam
judgment,
a
suit
for
money
is
permissibly,
notwithstanding
that
it
arises
from
the
navigable
waters,
a
state
common
law
claim,
if
it
be
such.
now,
i
understand
the
majority's
opinion
of
this
court
in
romero
to
be
to
the
effect
that
there
is
a
“common
law”
law
of
the
maritime
controllable
by
this
court
in
the
sense
that
it
must
be
uniform
throughout
the
country.
in
that
sense,
it
is
nationally
administered
but
nevertheless,
in
its
origins,
it
comes
from
the
state
common
law.
it
was
the
minority
ruling
to
apply
--
the
minority
in
romero.
there'd
be
no
question
this
man
had
a
jury
trial.
he'd
be
in
the
court
under
1331
of
title
28.
but
under
the
majority
opinion,
in
applying
romero
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
that's
our
position
here,
sir.
now,
i
just
want
to
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
that
is
the
basic
point
i
want
to
make
and
the
answer
there
is
no.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
that
is
the
basic
point
i
want
to
make.
he
came
in
on
a
pending
jurisdiction
theory,
assuming
that
he
hadn't
--
he
didn't
have
diversity
of
citizenship,
holding
that
to
the
side.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
he
claimed,
just
as
a
man
with
a
copyright
and
an
unfair
competition
case,
the
classic
hurn
v.
oursler
case.
he
has
a
federal
claim
under
the
copyright
act
and
the
unfair
com
--
this
man
had
a
federal
claim
under
the
jones
act.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
he
claimed
that
he
had
a
substantially
related
claim
under
maintenance
and
cure.
he
claims
that
that
is
a
state
claim
under
the
common
law.
it
may
also
be
a
federal
admiralty
and
maritime
claim
but
it's
also
a
state
common
law
claim.
he
alleges
it,
appended
to
his
federal
substantially
related
jones
act
claim.
he
is
therefore
entitled
to
walk
in
the
door
with
his
substantially
related
claim.
that's
the
tail
to
the
dog.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
from
the
majority
opinion
in
romero,
from
the
various
decisions
cited
to
this
court,
it
is
historical
that
the
claim
for
maintenance
and
cure
arises
out
of
the
common
law.
this
is
what
this
court
decided
in
romero.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
excuse
me?
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
thank
you,
your
honor,
yes.
it
is
exactly,
it's
a
savings
law
claim,
a
clause
claim.
it
is
one
of
those
common
law
claims
that
existed
prior
to
the
judiciary
act
of
1789,
historically
triable
in
the
state
courts
to
a
jury
and
was
saved
to
suitors
under
the
judiciary
act
of
1789.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
this
is
what
this
court
said
in
madruga,
that
the
fact
that
it
is
maritime
doesn't
mean
that
it
is
not
state
common
law.
that
is
the
--
i
hope
that
that
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes,
if
i
may
adopt
your
honor's
words,
it
is
both,
a
maritime
and
a
common
law
claim,
if
that
it
was
what
your
honor
is
saying.
at
least
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
as
to
that,
as
i
unders
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
mr.
justice
harlan,
if
i
may
respond
this
way.
not
that
our
agreement,
counsel's
agreement,
is
in
any
way
binding
on
the
court,
but
the
answer
to
the
diversity
of
citizenship
proposition
could
not
be
what
counsel
have
agreed
it
to
be
if
there
wasn't
a
state
common
law
basis
for
the
maintenance
and
cure
claim
because
if
there
isn't
such
a
basis,
then
diversity
of
citizenship
would
not
apply
and
it
could
not
enter
the
federal
court
as
a
diversity
of
citizenship
case
because
that
principle
applies
only
to
state
common
law
claims.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
yes,
your
honor.
i
refer
to
leon
v.
galceran,
cited
below,
dealing
with
wages
but
honoring
wages
to
the
end
of
the
voyage
is
--
well,
i
submit,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
not
in
any
sense
different
than
maintenance
and
cure.
it
comes
--
it
springs
from
the
same
birthplace
and
is
the
same
right
of
a
seaman.
the
seaman
injured
aboard
ship
in
the
course
of
employment
without
proving
negligence
or
unseaworthiness
entitled
to
three
things:
maintenance,
cure
and
unearned
wages,
from
the
laws
of
oleron,
etcetera,
and
that's
all
the
same
thing.
now,
leon
v.
galceran
deals
with
it
specifically,
garrett
v.
moore-mccormack
in
passing
and
if
i
may
refer
to
just
one
point
that
i
would
like
to
say
before
my
time
runs
up,
and
that
is
this.
the
aspect
of
whether
it's
pending
and
now
that
we
are
--
the
moot
question,
i
submit,
(a)
that
you
have
to
decide
as
was
pointed
out
from
the
bench
here,
this
question
when
it
arose.
and
it
arose
before
there'd
been
any
jury
verdict.
but
also,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
first
cause
of
action,
it
was
alleged
that
the
plaintiff
was
injured
by
the
failure
to
pay
the
maintenance
and
cure.
now,
unless
and
until
the
jury
--
the
trier
of
the
issue
of
what
maintenance
and
cure
would
do
had
decided
that
so
much
maintenance
was
due
and
so
much
cure
was
due
for
which
injuries
and
for
which
period
of
disability,
no
jury
could
possibly
return
a
verdict
for
nil
or
for
thousands
as
to
the
effect
of
the
aggravation
and
the
hurt
and
the
consequential
damages
to
this
seaman
by
the
failure
to
pay
the
maintenance
and
cure
when
due.
i
therefore
submit
that
if
the
petitioner
here
is
successful
before
this
honorable
court
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
no,
it
was
never
decided
because
the
jury
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
it
did
not
go
to
the
jury
and
it
could
not
go
to
the
jury
because
the
trial
court,
having
reserved
to
himself
in
subsequent
hearings
to
be
held
after
the
verdict
of
the
jury,
the
question
of
what
maintenance
and
cure
would
do
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
in
effect,
he
did,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
point.
he
said
that
all
main
--
that
maintenance
and
cure
issues
were
to
be
decided
on
evidence
submitted
to
him
after
the
jury
verdict.
he
uses
the
very
words
“after
the
jury
verdict,”
and
that's
what
happened.
and
i
submit
that
no
jury
could've
possibly
considered
the
question
of
the
failure
to
pay
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
submit
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
i
submit
that
your
remand
should
include
a
direction
that
if
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
you
--
not
allowed
me
to
argue
here
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
you
may
see
fit
on
this
early
discussion
to
allow
a
reopening
of
the
petition,
i
don't
know.
i
hope.
but,
in
any
case,
i
submit
that
the
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
well,
it
truly
was
not
improvidently
or
incompetently
granted.
that
i'm
sure
of
but
in
any
case,
i
say
that
the
denial
of
the
writ
on
the
jones
act
was
limited
only
to
the
question
of
the
jones
act
claim
basically,
as
it
related
to
the
negligence
of
ordering
up
--
him
up
the
gangway
and
whether
certain
evidence
have
noticed
that
should've
been
admitted
--
wasn't
admitted
and
whether
it
was
probably
for
the
circuit
court,
which
held
that
it
was
improper
to
bar
the
evidence
to
nevertheless
sustain
the
verdict.
that
was
the
jones
act
claim
that
was
submitted
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
was
not
covered
but
the
jones
act
claim,
insofar
as
related
to
the
maintenance
and
cure
issues,
has
never
been
submitted.
and,
i
submit,
on
the
remand
if
granted,
should
clearly
state
rather
than
us
have
to
argue
below
that
we
are
now
permitted
to
try
all
of
the
issues
limited
relating
to
maintenance
and
cure,
whatsoever
they'd
be,
including,
if
the
petition
again
so
show,
the
negligent
failure
to
pay
the
maintenance
and
cure
when
due
and
the
aggravation
and
consequential
harm
which
flowed
there
from.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
i'm
sorry.
i
have
it
here.
i
didn't
get
to
it.
simler
v.
conner
clearly
held
that
--
also
held,
in
addition
to
noting
this
court's
historic
favor,
looking
at
favor
upon
trial
by
jury
of
issues.
also
noted
that
the
basic
nature
of
the
claim
must
be
looked
to
rather
than
the
words
of
the
pleading
or
the
form
of
which
it's
presented.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
i
surely
didn't
hope
--
intended
to
say
that
mr.
justice
stewart.
what
i
said
was
that
this
is
both
a
maritime
and
a
common
law
claim,
historically
triable
before
a
jury
in
the
places
and
in
the
courts
where
it
arose,
before
there
was
a
constitution,
before
there
was
a
federal
court,
before
this
great
institution
existed.
the
courts
of
the
states
and
the
colonies
tried
this
claim
before
a
jury.
that
was
the
basic
nature
of
it.
looking
to
the
basic
nature
of
it,
this
court,
whether
it
apply
the
state
law
on
the
pending
jurisdiction
theory
or
the
--
establish
a
federal
rule
looking
to
the
origin
and
basic
nature
of
the
claim,
i
submit
in
both
--
through
both
avenues,
may
and
should
grant
a
trial
by
jury
and
--
or
viewed
from
a
more
modern
view
point,
viewing
the
policy
as
conceded
here
by
counsel
as
to
what
should
be
desirable,
this
court
may
and
should
establish
as
a
policy
that
these
type
of
claims
when
joined
and
when
related
to
the
same
incident
in
employment
and
injuries
should
be
tried
with
the
same
jury
that
decides
a
substantial
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes.
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
that
is
correct
and
--
but
as
to
one
that
is
--
mr.
theodore
h.
friedman
yes.
but
as
to
the
question
of
what
standard
or
what
rule
to
apply
to
a
maintenance
and
cure
claim
which
is
substantially
related
and
intertwined
with
a
jones
act
claim
arising
out
of
the
same
incident,
this
i
submit,
we
have
no
determination
from
this
court
and
i
submit
that
policy
considerations
dictate
that
it
be
granted
a
jury
trial.
i
also
submit
that
this
case
was
not
before
the
--
judge
levitt
on
the
admiralty
side.
it
was
not
an
admiralty
case.
it
was
before
him
as
a
civil
side
case
all
the
way
from
the
very
beginning.
thank
you
and
i
thank
the
court
for
allowing
me
the
extra
time.
