mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
in
his
original
brief
and
in
his
reply
brief
which
i
received
today
or
so
ago
and
here
today
has
alluded
to
and
has
been
arguing
questions
which
this
court
refused
to
consider
when
it
granted
the
writ.
one
of
the
questions
is
this
very
diversity
question
that
has
been
discussed
with
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
will
not
yield
to
the
temptation
at
this
time
to
attempt
to
refute
the
argument
on
these
questions
that
are
now
presented.
and
i
will
deal
solely
with
the
question
which
is
presented,
which
i'll
read.
question:
“does
a
seaman
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
a
claim
for
unpaid
maintenance
and
cure
enjoined
by
the
claim
for
jones
act
negligence?”
that
is
the
only
question
that
is
presented
to
the
court
here
today.
now,
since
maintenance
and
cure
is
basically
a
maritime
claim,
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
discuss
briefly
the
historical
background
and
development
of
the
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
as
this
court
knows,
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
constitution.
there
existed
in
america
a
system
of
laws
and
these
laws
embodied
principles
of
the
maritime
law
which
principles
have
developed
from
the
very
early
ancient
sea
codes.
under
the
--
under
this
system,
maintenance
and
cure
claims
were
prevented
or
presented
for
adjudication
and
they
were
heard
and
determined
without
a
jury.
the
framers
of
the
constitution,
in
drafting
the
constitution,
had
this
system
in
mind
and
they
adopted
it
and
incorporated
it
into
the
constitution.
they
not
only
adopted
the
substantive
features
of
this
maritime
law,
this
admiralty
maritime
jurisdiction,
but
also
the
procedural
feature
which
did
not
permit
a
jury
trial
in
these
maritime
claims.
now,
article
3,
section
2,
clause
1
of
the
constitution
is
the
provision
which
incorporated
this
preexisting
system
and
it
read
that
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
shall
extend
to
all
cases
of
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction.
now,
in
addition
to
article
3,
section
2,
clause
1,
the
framers
of
the
constitution
further
provided
in
article
3
that
congress
would
have
the
power
to
set
up
inferior
federal
courts.
and
pursuant
to
this
power,
congress
set
up
the
inferior
court
system
under
the
first
judiciary
act
of
1789.
and
among
other
things,
congress
invested
these
inferior
courts
with
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction.
these
courts
were
not
common
law
courts
or
courts
of
general
jurisdiction.
their
jurisdiction
was
strictly
limited
to
what
congress
had
conferred
upon
them.
now,
the
language
of
this
act
of
1789
did
not
show
any
indication
on
the
part
of
congress
to
change
the
existing
maritime
practice
of
hearing
these
maritime
claims
without
a
jury.
all
that
it
provided
for,
it
preserved
to
suitors
the
right
to
pursue
the
common
law
remedies
in
the
state
courts
which
they
had
a
right
before
the
adoption
of
the
constitution.
thus,
from
the
very
founding
of
the
constitution
and
the
enactment
of
the
first
judiciary
act,
the
federal
courts
had
the
power
to
hear
and
determine
these
maritime
claims
but
only
on
its
admiralty
side
where
a
jury
was
not
allowed.
the
first
judiciary
act
did
not
authorize
the
courts
to
give
jury
trials
which
congress
had
not
provided
for
and
congress,
up
to
this
present
day
has
not
seen
fit
to
provide
in
these
maritime
claims,
the
jury
trials
except
in
two
classes
of
cases
which
are
not
here
applicable.
that's
the
cases,
so-called
great
lake
cases
which
is
28
u.s.c.
1783,
in
the
jones
act
case,
46
u.s.c.
688.
now,
the
petition
--
now
recognizing
the
fact,
that
this
court
did
not
have
the
power
to
try
a
maritime
case
with
the
jury,
has
asserted
that
because
his
maritime
cause
of
action
was
joined
with
his
jones
act
claim,
therefore
he's
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
and
in
doing
this,
he
adopts
the
doctrine
of
hurn
v.
oursler,
which
i
submit
to
your
honors,
is
not
applicable
in
this
case
at
all.
the
hurn
doctrine
of
pendency
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
mode
of
trial.
it
relates
solely
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
the
authority
of
the
federal
court
to
decide
a
nonfederal
claim
that
is
appended
to
a
federal
claim.
it's
really
a
question
of
jurisdiction
and
giving
access
in
the
federal
court
to
a
state
claim.
i
submit
to
your
honors
there's
no
--
there's
no
sound
basis
for
extending
this
hurn
doctrine
which
is
limited
strictly
to
jurisdictional
and
not
to
mode
of
trial,
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
congress
is
not
seen
fit
to
extend
jury
trials
in
these
maritime
claims
and
the
constitution
certainly
does
not
provide
for
it.
now,
since
petitioner's
maintenance
and
cure
claim
was
joined
in
the
same
complaint
with
his
jones
act
claim,
it
is
therefore
subject
to
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
no,
i
do
not,
sir.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
yes
sir.
the
only
thing
i
do
question
is
that
the
mode
of
trial
is
governed
by
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
the
district
court
must
follow
these
rules
in
giving
the
mode
of
trial.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
your
honor,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
cannot
quarrel
with
the
policy
considerations
urged
by
my
opponent.i
must
concede
that
from
a
practical
standpoint
of
convenience
that
it
probably
would
be
better
to
try
these
two
claims
together.
my
position
is
that
the
court
does
not
have
the
right
or
the
power
to
do
that
is
up
to
the
congress
or
this
court
under
its
rulemaking
power
to
provide
for
that
right,
and
that
the
district
court
cannot
do
it.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
well,
there's
no
--
no,
mr.
justice
black,
there's
no
statute
that
says
they
cannot
do
it
but,
from
the
history
of
the
development
of
the
maritime
law,
as
i
just
attempted
to
point
out,
from
time
immemorial
in
maritime
cases,
you
have
not
had
juries.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
well,
you
mean
before
this
case?
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
no.
no,
sir.
no,
mr.
justice
black.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
such
case.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
yes,
sir.
my
case
depends
upon
the
lack
of
power
in
the
district
court
to
grant
a
jury
trial
in
a
maritime
claim
absent
diversity
of
citizenship.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
that's
right,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
that's
correct.
now,
as
i
was
saying
--
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
yes.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
i
must
agree
with
my
opponent
as
far
as
policy
considerations
are
concerned.
it
probably
would
be
better,
more
convenient,
can
save
time
of
the
court
to
try
both
of
these
claims
together,
but
i
say
that
the
court
has
no
such
right
to
do
that
absent
--
this
court
here,
making
a
rule
providing
for
it.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
yes,
sir.
i
return
now
to
my
discussion
of
the
federal
rules
which
would
govern
in
this
case
because
the
maintenance
and
cure
claim
was
pendent
to
the
jones
act
claim.
rule
38
and
rule
39
are
the
specific
rules
which
deal
with
the
mode
of
trial
in
cases
where
these
rules
are
applicable.
now,
under
rule
38,
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
is
preserved
and
filed,
as
declared
by
the
seventh
amendment,
in
cases
as
declared
by
the
seventh
amendment
and
statutes
by
the
united
states.
and
under
rule
39,
if
the
court
should
find
that
one
of
the
issues
in
which
a
jury
trial
has
been
demanded
does
not
come
under
the
seventh
amendment
or
under
the
statute
of
the
united
states
and
they
cannot
grant
a
jury
trial
and
this
is
a
specific
prohibition
in
the
rules
to
that
effect.
now,
petitioner
in
this
case
does
not
come
under
the
seventh
amendment
of
the
constitution
because
that
deals
with
common
law
rights
and
remedies
and
i
pose
that
such
situations,
the
common
law
right
to
a
jury
trial
shall
be
preserved.
petitioner
does
not
come
under
that
because
this
is
a
maritime
right.
it's
maritime
in
nature
and
it's
not
legal
or
common
law
in
nature
whatsoever.
petitioner
has
no
right
to
a
jury
trial
under
any
statute
of
the
united
states.
congress
has
seen
fit
to
enact
two
statutes
in
which
it
has
specifically
granted
jury
trials.
one
of
them
is
the
great
lake
statute
which
i
have
referred
to
before
in
the
jones
act,
but
neither
of
these
statutes
includes
the
maintenance
and
cure
claim.
surely,
the
language
of
the
jones
act
itself
doesn't
expressly
include
it.
there's
nothing
in
the
act
at
all
that
refers
to
maintenance
and
cure.
however,
petitioner
takes
the
position
that
the
maintenance
and
cure
claim
is
so
intertwined
as
it
puts
it
with
the
jones
act
case
that
it
becomes
part
of
it.
and
therefore,
it
was
--
it's
implicit
that
congress
must
have
intended
that
it'd
be
tried
with
the
jones
act
case
into
a
jury.
i
point
out
that
while
it
is
true,
there
is
some
connection
between
a
jones
act
case
and
the
maintenance
and
cure
case,
that
is,
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
intertwining,
particularly
in
this
case,
because
the
jones
act
case
is
based
upon
one
and
the
same
action
as
the
maintenance
and
cure
claim.
so,
there
is
intertwining
to
that
extent.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
that's
correct.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
that's
correct.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
that's
correct.
this
--
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
there
was
a
claim
for
unseaworthiness
and
negligence
and
that
issue
was
submitted
to
the
jury
--
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
--
for
determination
and
resulted
in
a
verdict
for
the
defendant.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
that's
--
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
well,
to
answer
your
question,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
it
should
be
determined
there.
that's
correct
but,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white,
it
is
a
fact
that
we
no
longer
have
anymore
jones
act
or
unseaworthiness
claim
in
this
case.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
it
was
decided
against
the
petitioner.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
that's
correct.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
correct.
and
i
say,
because
of
that
situation,
i
think
the
writ
has
been
improvidently
granted.
and
i
so
argue
that
in
the
first
point
of
my
brief.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
that's
the
problem
presented
here,
your
honor.
there's
one
other
element
i
would
like
to
add
and
that
is
we
do
not
have
diversity
of
citizenship
here.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
yes.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
that's
right
sir.
so,
getting
back
to
the
intertwining
of
the
maintenance
and
cure
claim
with
the
jones
act
claim,
i
say
that
the
only
intertwining
in
this
case
is
that
both
claims
arose
out
of
the
same
accident
and
nothing
more.
that's
where
the
intertwining
ceases
from
thereon.
you
have
separate
and
distinct
and
independent
causes
of
action.
the
jones
act
cause
of
action
is
an
action
that
damages
personal
injury
based
on
negligence.
your
maintenance
and
cure
of
cause
of
action
is
simply
an
action
to
recover
maintenance.
all
you
have
to
show
in
such
an
action
is
that
an
action
or
an
injury
occurred
on
the
ship
and
that
you
were
disabled
during
a
certain
period
of
time
and
therefore,
you're
entitled
to
be
maintained
during
that
period
of
time.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
just
to
one.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
does
the
seaman
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
a
claim
for
unpaid
maintenance
and
cure
when
joined
with
a
claim
for
jones
act
negligence?
that's
the
only
question
that
--
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
it's
not
his
fault,
if
your
honor
please,
that
this
court
has
seen
fit
to
deny
his
--
the
other
questions
that
he
presented.
if
that's
what
you
mean.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
going
back
again
to
the
history
of
the
admiralty
maritime
jurisdiction
prior
to
the
constitution,
even
in
state
courts,
maritime
matters
were
heard
and
determined
and
in
those
instances,
jury
trials
were
permitted
and
when
the
constitution
was
enacted
or
rather
when
the
judiciary
act
was
passed
and
the
congress
set
up
the
inferior
courts
and
invested
them
with
jurisdiction
in
these
admiralty
maritime
matters,
they
specifically
reserved
to
suitors
the
right
to
pursue
whatever
remedies
were
existing
at
that
time
in
the
common
law
courts
of
the
states
and
colonies.
so,
this
practice
of
hearing
and
determining
maritime
claims
in
common
law
existed
long
before
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
and
that
was
preserved
in
the
savings
to
the
suitor's
clause.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
yes,
i
do.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
i
do,
sir.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
correct.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
that's
correct.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
i
would
be
interested
in
that
case,
your
honor.
mr.
matthew
l.
danahar
in
summary,
i
would
just
like
to
say
that
in
the
absence
of
diversity,
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
that
maintenance
and
cure
claim
is
not
properly
triable
to
a
jury
on
the
civil
side
of
the
federal
court,
that
pendency
of
policy
considerations
notwithstanding
the
district
court,
does
not
have
the
power
to
extend
this
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
his
maritime
claim
for
maintenance
and
cure.
