well,
is
there
any
statute
or
rule
that
says
they
cannot
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
that
that's
the
court's
--
this
case
--
courts
has
held
that
equity
cases
and
maritime
cases
do
not
require
to
have
a
jury.
the
constitution
doesn't
tell
us,
but
has
there
ever
been
any
case
that
said
that
--
there
may
have
been
that
a
maritime
case
cannot
be
tried
before
a
jury
if
the
judge
wants
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
well,
this
case,
as
i
gather,
would
put
perhaps
on
the
ground
that
the
claim
didn't
come
at
the
right
time.
but
whether
--
has
there
ever
been
a
case
in
this
court,
as
i've
said
that
a
maritime
issue
like
this
cannot
be
tried
before
a
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
reason
i
was
a
little
startled
when
you
said
the
court
was
without
power.
i
understand
your
historical
argument,
but
you're
going
far
enough
to
say
it
was
without
power
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
your
case
depends
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
as
i
understand,
you
agree
that
--
i
thought
you
said
that
if
there
is
power,
that
you
agree
with
the
other
side
as
to
the
policy
of
the
obedience
and
the
wisdom
of
doing
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
insofar
as
the
court
procedure
is
concerned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
it
would
have
to
be
expressly
permitted
by
a
rule
or
a
statute.
