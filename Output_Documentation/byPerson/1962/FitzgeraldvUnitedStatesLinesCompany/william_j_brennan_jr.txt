justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
get
them
while
he
was
hospitalized?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
get
this
through?
looking
at
the
petition,
there
were
two
grounds,
the
questions
presented
under
the
jones
act
suits
which
we
refused
to
take,
is
that
it?
questions
three
and
four
seemed
to
deal
with
the
jones
act
claim,
questions
one
and
two,
the
maintenance
and
cure
claim.
i'm
looking
at
the
petition
for
cert,
what
we
do,
limit
this
to
questions
one
and
two?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
to
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
in
a
sense,
suggested
independently
that
1331
point
that
probably
a
jury
trial
is
required
where
joined
with
a
jones
act
case,
could
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
the
whole
burden
of
the
savings
clause,
that
even
if
it
is
a
maritime
claim,
it
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
was
actionable
in
common
law
and,
under
the
savings
clause,
is
actionable
in
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
was
a
negligent
failure
to
pay,
i
gather,
as
a
jones
act
claim,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
wasn't
that
decided
against
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
that
go
to
the
jury?
i
don't
know.
i
haven't
read
the
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
did
the
judge
take
to
himself
the
jones
act
phase
or
the
negligent
(inaudible)
phase?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
telling
us
that
it's
still
opened,
the
jones
act
claim,
based
on
negligent
failure
to
pay
maintenance
and
cure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
way
we've
limited
your
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we've
thrown
you
out
on
the
jones
act
claims
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
we're
(voice
overlap)
throwing
you
out.
we
just
haven't
let
you
open
your
mouth
yet.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
rather
than
dismiss
as
incompetently
granted.
