the
issue
of
being
whether
you'd
reached
the
point
of
maximum
cure,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
the
duty
--
just
to
verify
the
confusion
in
my
mind,
the
duty
of
maintenance
and
cure
is
to
pay
cure
up
to
the
point
of
maximum
cure
where
it
--
up
to
the
point
when
no
more
treatment
would
do
any
good.
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
maintenance
is
what?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
wonder
where
the
$8
a
day
came
from
because
that
was
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
matter
of
universal
custom
now?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
say
what
the
period
involved
as
to
maintenances
here?
justice
potter
stewart
did
it
--
if
this
had
been
only
a
suit
for
maintenance
and
cure,
you
make
no
contention
that
it
could
have
been
tried
in
any
other
way
except
before
a
judge
alone,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
even
so,
this
isn't
a
common
law
action,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
assuming
a
law
--
a
suit
only
for
maintenance
and
cure,
nothing
else
joined
with
it.
justice
potter
stewart
i
follow
this
all
except
to
your
assumption
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
jury
in
a
state
court.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
--
are
you
--
the
question
i'm
asking
is
not
whether
a
court
may
submit
it
to
a
jury
but
whether
a
court
must,
upon
request,
submit
it
to
a
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
question
in
any
way
the
propriety
jointer
of
the
two
claims,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
customary.
that's
all
the
time
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
well,
even
--
it
doesn't
necessarily
--
perhaps
the
only
--
in
your
opinion,
the
only
good
argument
you
can
make
is
that
--
and
the
only
one
that
will
stand
up,
but
judge
smith
and
judge
waterman
apparently
didn't
feel
there
was
a
lack
of
power
in
the
judges,
the
trial
judges'
discretion
to
submit
the
maintenance
and
cure
case
to
the
jury
and
that
indeed,
the
district
judge
did
have
such
discretion
to
submit
it
but
they
nevertheless
concurred
with
the
--
with
judge
friendly's
judgment
because
they
didn't
think
that
there
was
any
compulsion
to
do
so,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
may
or
may
not
be
valid
but
in
other
words,
at
least
two
circuit
judges
didn't
go
so
far
as
you
did
and
they
nevertheless
concurred
in
the
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
but
am
i
right
in
remembering
that
in
order
to
recover
maintenance
and
cure,
you
don't
have
to
show
any
unseaworthiness
or
any
fault
or
anything
else
in
the
part
of
the
ship?
if
you
fall
sick
and
you're
a
member
of
the
ship's
crew,
you're
entitled
to
maintenance
and
cure,
are
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well
your
--
your
point,
i
gather,
is
that
the
question
on
which
we
granted
certiorari
and
the
present
posture
of
the
case
simply
isn't
here.
justice
potter
stewart
what
we
have
now
is
an
isolated
single
claim
for
maintenance
and
cure.
justice
potter
stewart
not
joined
to
anything
else.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
just
to
one.
just
to
one.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it's
not
his
fault
if
we
severed
this
now
so
that's
--
and
make
it
a
maintenance
and
cure
claim,
is
it?
he
tried
to
get
his
--
justice
potter
stewart
so,
you're
--
in
basic
agreement,
as
i
understand
you
with
mr.
friedman,
aren't
you,
mr.
danahar,
on
the
outer
limits
of
this
thing?on
the
general
framework,
you
say
that
you
agree
with
him,
as
i
understand
it
that
perhaps
you
don't,
that
if
this
certainly
--
if
this
were
in
a
--
in
a
state
court,
an
action
exclusively
for
maintenance
and
cure,
the
plaintiff
would
be
entitled
upon
request
to
a
jury
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
and
do
you
all
--
further
agree
that
in
a
federal
court
where
jurisdiction
is
based
upon
diversity
of
citizenship
there
would
also
be
such
a
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
--
and
then
he
agrees
with
you
on
the
other
hand
that
if
jurisdiction
is
based
only
on
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
and
there's
a
single
action
for
maintenance
and
cure,
that
he
would
have
no
right
to
a
jury
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
think
therefore,
you
--
at
least
on
the
outer
limits,
we've
narrowed
the
controversy
between
you.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
fed
--
but
your
--
accepting
everything
you
say
about
his
right
of
action
in
a
state
court
and
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
there,
a
federal
court
is
a
court
of
limited
jurisdiction
and
the
jurisdiction
in
this
case
was
invoked,
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
was
invoked,
was
it
not?
there
was
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
tell
me
why.
justice
potter
stewart
right,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean,
it's
a
savings
act
claim.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
savings
clause
claim
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
what
you're
saying.
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
like
to
ask
you
about
what
you
think
of
the
effect
of
simler
against
conner
on
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
told
us
that
the
basic
nature
of
this
claim,
it's
an
admiralty
claim
and
in
the
federal
courts
alone
would
not
be
triable
as
of
right
to
a
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
mr.
friedman,
accepting
the
truth
of
your
historic
argument
that
before
there
was
a
constitution
these
were
triable
in
the
common
law
courts
of
the
colonies
before
juries
which
had
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
and
further
that
after
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
in
the
courts
of
the
state,
you
had
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
maintenance
and
cure
claim.
i
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
frankly
didn't
know
that
but
i
accept
--
accepting
all
that
is
true.
it
still
remains
a
fact,
does
it
not,
that
in
the
federal
trial
courts,
a
claim
--
an
isolated
claim
for
maintenance
and
cure
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
and
practice
and
precedent
is
not
triable
to
a
jury?
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
in
simler
--
let
me
just
ask
you
--
my
--
the
reason
i
asked
that
is
because
i
want
to
ask
a
further
question.
simler
against
conner
held,
did
it
not,
that
in
a
diversity
case
you
apply
the
federal
standard
in
order
to
find
out
whether
a
person
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
