justice

agreement.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
what
day?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question.
as
i
understand
you,
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
the
appeal
sua
sponte
in
effect.
in
other
words
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
there
was
no
motion
by
your
opponent
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
on
your
petition
for
rehearing,
did
you
ask
the
court
of
appeals
to
take
a
look
at
your
january
17
appeal
in
interpreting
the
scope
of
your
january
26
notice
of
appeal?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
i
--
i
guess
the
answer
to
my
question
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
the
court
of
appeals
displayed
knowledge
of
your
earlier
appeal
in
it's
your
original
opinion
and
all
you
were
arguing
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
all
that
you're
arguing
was
that
they
should've
interpreted
your
later
appeal
in
relation
to
the
scope
of
your
earlier
appeal.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
this
question
is
before
us
on
the
writ
of
certiorari.
i
don't
see
that
we
get
--
why
do
we
have
to
get
to
the
merits
of
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
that
isn't
the
only
question
we
have
up
here
as
to
whether
the
court
of
appeals
is
right
or
wrong
in
dismissing
the
appeal.
what
else
is
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
isn't
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
we've
just
been
giving
the
court
of
appeals'
advisory
opinion.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
none
of
our
business.
we
haven't
gotten
jurisdiction
under
that
(inaudible)
