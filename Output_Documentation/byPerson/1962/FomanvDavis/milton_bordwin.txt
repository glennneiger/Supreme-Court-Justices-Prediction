mr.
milton
bordwin
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
your
honors
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
having
arisen
on
the
district
court
before
the
district
of
massachusetts.
the
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
having
arisen
in
the
district
court
before
the
district
of
massachusetts
on
diversity
of
citizenship
jurisdiction.
thank
you.
the
case
has
never
gone
beyond
the
pleading
stage.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
action
on
the
ground
that
the
complaint
failed
to
state
a
claim
for
which
relief
could
be
granted.
the
plaintiff
filed
a
motion
to
amend
her
complaint
and
the
district
court
without
opinion
denied
the
motion.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
adequacy
of
the
complaint
was
not
tested,
the
court
holding
that
the
appeal
from
the
judgment
dismissing
the
action
had
not
properly
been
taken
and
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
that
portion
of
the
appeal
which
related
to
the
judgment
of
dismissal.
insofar
as
the
district
court's
denial
of
plaintiff's
motion
to
amend
her
complaint,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“there
are
no
facts
that
appear
to
us
that
would
indicate
an
abuse
of
discretion”,
that
is
the
considerations
before
the
district
court
are
not
before
us
and
they
affirmed
those
orders.
this
case
raises
some
very
basic
questions
in
the
area
of
federal
civil
procedure
and
the
issues
and
our
arguments
will
appear
in
a
full
statement
of
the
facts.
this
is
a
case
brought
against
a
decedent's
state.
the
plaintiff
is
the
daughter
of
the
decedent
and
she
alleges
in
her
complaint
the
following.
for
some
years
prior
to
1947,
the
plaintiff's
wife,
decedent's
mother,
was
confined
to
a
sanatorium
for
mental
and
other
disorders.
in
1947,
the
decedent
requested
of
the
plaintiff,
his
daughter
that
she
take
over
responsibility
for
the
care
and
support
of
her
mother.
and
in
1947,
the
complaint
alleges,
the
parties
orally
agreed
that
the
plaintiff
would
take
care
of
her
mother,
incur
all
the
liabilities
and
costs
for
her
support
and
maintenance
and
orally,
the
decedent
promised
that
he
would
neither
make
nor
leave
a
will
to
the
end
that
his
daughter
as
his
only
child
would
take
her
intestate
share
of
his
estate
under
the
intestacy
laws
of
massachusetts.
the
complaint
continues
alleging
full
performance
by
the
plaintiff
of
her
part
of
the
agreement.
she
paid
all
the
costs
of
her
mother's
care
and
support
in
the
sanatorium.
in
1951,
when
it
became
impossible
or
impracticable
for
the
sanatorium
to
care
for
her
mother
any
longer,
she
took
her
mother
into
her
own
home
and
there
cared
for
her
until
the
date
of
her
death
in
1953,
some
six
years
after
the
alleged
oral
agreement.
in
1957,
the
decedent
remarried,
and
in
that
year
made
a
will
in
which
he
bequeathed
his
entire
estate
except
for
a
$5000
legacy
to
a
brother,
to
his
wife
elvira
a.
davis,
the
individual
named
as
executrix
in
this
action.
some
two
years
after
the
marriage,
the
decedent
died.
the
complaint
concludes
with
a
prayer
for
judgment
in
that
amount
which
would
equal
the
amount
to
which
the
plaintiff
would
have
been
entitled
to,
had
the
decedent
died
without
making
a
will
as
allegedly
promise.
mr.
milton
bordwin
that
amount
is
two-thirds
of
his
estate
which
turned
out
to
be
$60,000
or
$40,000.
mr.
milton
bordwin
her
share
with
the
$40,000.
mr.
milton
bordwin
yes
sir.
in
due
course,
the
defendant
filed
an
answer
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
it
failed
to
state
a
claim
for
which
relief
could
be
granted.
mr.
milton
bordwin
excuse
me
sir?
yes
sir,
this
is
on
diversity
jurisdiction
and
the
district
court
on
december
16th
of
1960
allowed
that
motion
and
dismissed
the
complaint.
in
its
memorandum
opinion,
it
made
clear
that
the
only
grounds
on
which
it
relied
were
that
the
statute
of
frauds
constituted
a
bar
to
recovery
on
the
expressed
oral
contract.
it
did
not
consider
whether
the
complaint
stated
a
claim
for
relief
on
any
other
basis
that
is
implied
contract
of
quantum
meruit.
and
on
december
19th,
the
district
court
entered
judgment
dismissing
the
action.
the
very
next
day,
the
plaintiff
filed
two
motions
in
the
district
court.
one,
to
vacate
the
judgment
of
dismissal,
and
the
other,
to
amend
her
complaint
and
she
proffered
her
proposed
amendment.
mr.
milton
bordwin
that
was
december
20th,
the
day
after
the
judgment
was
entered.
that
amendment
added
two
new
factors
which
did
not
appear
in
the
original
complaint.
one
was
the
specification
of
the
dollar
amount
which
the
plaintiff
had
to
spend
in
caring
for
her
mother,
$12,500
and
a
prayer
for
judgment
in
that
amount.
and
plaintiff
asked
for
a
jury
trial.
i
would
like
to,
for
a
moment,
call
the
court's
attention
to
an
error
in
our
amendment
which
appears
on
page
10
of
the
record,
in
paragraph
2
of
the
amendment.
the
word
defendant
appears
instead
of
the
word
decedent.
this
we
took
to
be
a
clerical
error,
however,
the
defendant
has
raised
this
point
a
number
of
times
in
the
courts
below
and
raises
it
here
and
we
would
like
to
clarify
what
we
feel
to
be
the
position
of
this
error
now.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
first
opinion
and
this
error
was
raised
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
first
opinion
on
the
bottom
of
page
13
of
the
record,
characterized
this
amendment
as
“a
second
cause
of
action
for
moneys
paid
and
services
rendered
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
decedent”.
we
would
take
it
then
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
foreclosed
any
further
argument
that
that
word
defendant
was
intended
and
that
they
took
it
to
be
an
error
--
mr.
milton
bordwin
that
sir
is
on
the
bottom
of
page
13
of
the
record
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
where
they
characterized
the
amendment
as
a
second
--
about
four
lines
from
the
bottom,
the
second
cause
of
action
for
moneys
paid
and
services
rendered
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
decedent.
we
say
that
they
implicitly
overruled
the
argument
that
was
made
to
them
that
defendant
was
intentional.
in
any
event,
these
two
motions,
the
motion
to
vacate
judgment
and
the
motion
to
amend
the
complaint
were
both
pending
when
the
appeal
period
from
the
judgment
was
about
to
run
out
and
the
plaintiff
apprehends
unless
she
lose
her
right
to
appeal
from
that
judgment
on
january
17th,
1961.
he
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
with
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
from
the
judgment.on
january
23rd,
both
motions
were
denied
by
the
district
court.
that
is
the
motion
to
vacate
judgment
and
motion
to
amend
were
denied
without
opinion.and
on
january
26th,
we
filed
our
second
notice
of
appeal
from
the
orders
denying
these
two
motions.
within
the
time
prescribed
by
the
rules,
the
--
both
appeals
were
docketed
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
is
within
the
40-day
period
from
the
first
notice
of
appeal.
both
appeals
were
docketed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
on
february
24th,
that
court
consolidated
them
for
argument.
on
march
3rd,
the
plaintiff
filed
a
statement
of
points
in
compliance
with
the
federal
rules
of
procedure
and
the
rules
of
the
first
circuit,
a
statement
of
points
upon
which
she
intended
to
rely.
here,
she
raised
the
two
main
areas
that
were
--
that
arose
from
each
appeal,
one,
the
propriety
of
the
judgment
dismissing
the
action,
two,
the
propriety
of
the
orders
denying
leave
to
amend.
subsequently,
briefs
were
filed
in
exchange,
and
again,
these
two
issues
were
argued.
on
the
fourth
oral
argument
was
had
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
and
on
the
oral
argument,
judge
aldridge
inquired
of
the
--
of
counsel
as
to
what
was
properly
before
the
court
on
appeal.
specifically
he
asked
was
the
judgment
which
dismissed
the
action
properly
before
the
court
on
appeal.
in
its
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
held,
“no,
the
judgment
was
not
properly
before
the
court”.
and
it
reasoned
as
follows.
it
said,
whether
the
judgment
was
before
the
court
of
appeals,
depended
on
whether
it
was
a
final
decision,
whether
it
was
appealable
when
the
first
notice
of
appeal
was
filed.
this
in
turn,
depends
on
the
effect,
our
motion
to
vacate
had
on
the
finality
of
the
judgment
that
is
certain
motions
will
affect
the
finality
of
the
judgment
and
others
will
not.
the
court
said
that
the
motion
being
undesignated
could
have
been
filed
under
either
rule
59
which
deals
with
motions
to
alter
or
amend
judgments
or
under
rule
60
which
deals
with
relief
from
judgment.
if
it
was
filed
under
rule
59,
says
the
court,
the
time
for
taking
an
appeal
is
told.
and
this,
says
the
court,
means
that
the
judgment
has
deprived
of
its
finality,
and
therefore,
any
notice
of
appeal
filed
during
the
impendency
of
a
59
motion
is
premature
and
presumably
void.
rule
60
motions
do
not
affect
the
finality
of
the
judgment,
and
therefore,
any
notice
of
appeal
filed
during
dependency
of
a
60
motion
would
be
valid
or
otherwise
timely.
the
court
holds
--
and
this
page
14
of
the
record.
“although
the
cases
do
authorize
a
vacating
of
a
judgment
under
both
rules
in
the
proper
circumstances,
we
believe
that
the
full
context
of
the
rules
dictates
that
resort
should
be
made
to
the
procedure
under
rule
59
if
time
for
applying
for
such
motions
has
not
expired”.
this
then
is
the
ground
that
the
court
relies
on,
this
full
context
of
the
rules
reasoning,
it
seems,
from
the
10-day
limitation
in
rule
59.
that
is,
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
be
saying,
since
a
motion
under
rule
59
must
be
filed
within
10
days
of
judgment
and
your
motion
was
filed
within
10
days
of
judgment,
therefore,
it
is
a
rule
59
motion.
therefore,
you
get
no
review
on
the
merits
because
your
judgment
was
not
final.
your
notice
of
appeal
was
premature
and
we
will
dismiss
the
appeal
insofar
as
it
is
taken
from
the
judgment.
the
court
notes
the
alternative
results
that
will
be
achieved
under
a
59
or
a
60
treatment
but
this
doesn't
enter
into
their
decision
nor
do
they
advert
to
the
policy
that
cases
be
decided
on
their
merits
wherever
possible
rather
than
dismissed
on
the
procedural
technicality.
the
court's
approach
--
the
court's
academic
approach
is
illustrated
by
its
citation
of
professor
moore's
criticism
of
the
chicago
and
northwest
railway
case.
in
that
case,
the
judgment
was
entered
by
the
district
court
dismissing
the
action
for
improper
venue.
the
plaintiff
then
filed
a
motion
to
vacate
the
judgment
and
to
have
the
case
transferred
to
the
proper
district.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
specifically
relying
on
rule
60.
professor
moore
says
this
is
wrong
because
the
court
didn't
have
to
rely
on
rule
60.
the
motion
was
filed
within
10
days
and
it
could
have
relied
on
rule
59.
this
maybe
so
but
it
didn't
make
one
wit
of
difference
in
that
case
whether
it
was
59
or
60.
and
in
this
case,
it's
of
crucial
importance.
in
regard
to
the
second
notice
of
appeal
which
we
filed,
the
court
of
appeals
says,
“you
could
have
referred
to
the
judgment
but
you
didn't.
you
referred
only
to
the
denial
of
your
post
judgment
motions
and
that
of
course
doesn't
cover
the
judgment”.
and
they
dismissed
the
appeal
insofar
as
it's
taken
from
the
judgment.
on
the
second
aspect
of
the
appeal
that
is
the
propriety
of
the
orders
denying
us
that
leave
to
amend,
the
court
says,
“there
is
nothing
presented
by
the
record
to
show
the
circumstances
which
were
before
the
district
court
for
its
consideration
and
ruling
on
the
motions,
we
therefore
cannot
say
that
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion”.
there
was
no
mentioned
by
the
court
of
rule
15
(a)
which
says
that
permission
to
amend
should
be
freely
given
when
justice
requires.
there
is
no
mentioned
by
the
court
of
the
fact
and
i
raise
this
for
the
first
time
now.
it's
in
the
brief
but
i
haven't
raised
it
in
oral
earlier.
the
court
does
not
mention
the
fact
that
the
district
court
refused
to
follow
a
first
circuit
case,
the
1933
case
of
cleaves
versus
kenny
in
holding
as
it
did
on
the
statute
of
frauds
issue.
cleaves
versus
kenny
held
that
an
oral
contract
to
revoke
a
will
and
codicil
and
to
die
intestate
were
not
barred
by
the
statute
of
frauds.
the
plaintiff
expressly
relied
on
that.
the
district
court
shows
not
to
follow
this,
there
is
no
mention
made
of
this
factor
nor
is
there
a
mention
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
question
whether
the
complaint
as
it
stood
would
have
sufficed
to
be
a
basis
for
recovery
in
quantum
meruit.
in
due
course,
the
plaintiff
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
with
the
court
of
appeals.
we
cited
to
them
a
line
of
cases
representing
every
federal
jurisdiction
--
federal
appellate
jurisdiction
including
this
court
and
including
the
first
circuit.
those
cases
uniformly
held
that
where
a
notice
of
appeal
refers
not
to
a
judgment
but
to
the
denial
of
post-judgment
motions
if
the
intention
to
appeal
from
the
judgment
will
otherwise
appear,
the
court
will
review
the
judgment.
rehearing
was
denied
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
respect
to
this
on
page
21
of
the
record,
plaintiff's
second
notice
of
appeal
cannot
be
said
to
indicate
an
intention
to
appeal
from
the
original
judgment
of
dismissal.
thus,
the
court
required
that
the
intention
to
appeal
appear
from
the
second
notice
or
not
at
all.
the
court
disregards
the
first
notice
which
was
an
expressed
intention
of
appeal
of
--
intention
to
appeal
from
the
judgment.
it
disregards
the
statement
of
points,
it
disregards
the
briefs
filed
by
both
parties
and
it
disregards
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
in
nowise
prejudiced
by
this
technical
error.
indeed,
it
seems
that
our
care
in
filing
that
first
notice
of
appeal,
prejudices
us
for
the
court
says,
“since
your
intention
must
appear
from
the
second
notice,
it
does
not
--
you
obviously
intended
your
first
notice
to
cover
the
judgment
and
now
that
we
say
that
your
first
notice
is
premature
and
void,
you
argue
that
your
second
notice
covers
the
judgment
and
you
will
not
be
heard
to
argue
this.
if
i
may
digress
for
a
moment,
i
think
the
--
mr.
milton
bordwin
sir?
mr.
milton
bordwin
i
--
i
--
mr.
milton
bordwin
no,
i
wouldn't
admit
it.
i
say
the
question
in
my
petition
but
it
is
one
of
the
weaker
arguments
which
isn't
as
clear
as
it
might
be
on
the
law
and
the
--
mr.
milton
bordwin
i
don't
argue
it,
no.
i
have
no
need
to
fall
back
on
that.
if
i
might
digress
for
a
moment,
the
error
that
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
have
fallen
into
here
is
failure
to
distinguish
between
two
separate
and
distinct
concepts.
on
the
one
hand,
appellate
jurisdiction,
on
the
other
hand,
scope
of
the
appeal.
now,
appellate
jurisdiction
using
the
word
jurisdiction
in
its
strict
sense,
and
by
strict
sense,
i
mean
impersona
jurisdiction
or
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
of
the
interim
action
or
the
peculiar
competency
of
a
court
of
limited
jurisdiction
over
a
certain
case
or
class
of
cases
such
as
probate
courts,
military
courts.
this
type
of
jurisdiction
is
required
in
order
for
a
judgment
to
be
valid
that
is
not
void
and
not
collaterally
attackable.
now
this
type
of
jurisdiction,
the
late
judge
hand
addressed
himself
to
in
the
area
of
appellate
jurisdiction.
in
the
case
cited
by
the
defendant
in
her
brief
in
our
position
on
page
8,
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
versus
congregation
of
poile
zedek.
judge
hand
says,
“some
paper
must
be
filed
in
at
least
one
court
--
excuse
me,
or
the
other
to
constitute
a
notice
of
appeal.
the
least
requirement
which
will
be
tolerable
is
that
some
papers
shall
be
accessible
in
the
records
of
the
court
upon
which
both
judges
and
parties
can
rely”.
in
that
case,
the
appellant
had
merely
sent
a
letter
to
the
appellee
indicating
an
intention
to
appeal.
but
this
is
what
is
required
for
appellate
jurisdiction.
but
once
that
paper
is
filed,
we
submit,
appellate
jurisdiction
is
complete.
the
court
has
the
--
the
appellate
court
has
confidence
over
the
action.
the
next
question,
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
appeal
is
separate
although
the
scope
of
the
appeal
is
usually
determined
from
the
very
notice
from
which
appellate
jurisdiction
is
derived
and
it's
the
notice
of
appeal
which
specifies
the
judgment
or
portion
thereof,
many
courts
have
looked
outside
of
the
notice
to
find
the
intention
to
appeal,
witness
that
line
of
cases
we
cited
in
our
petition
for
rehearing.
they
have
looked
to
designations
of
record
on
appeal.
they
have
looked
to
that
statement
of
points.
they
have
looked
to
the
briefs.
we
cite
these
cases
in
our
brief.
indeed,
one
case
which
the
defendant
cites
for
the
proposition
that
the
second
notice
is
inadequate
to
raise
the
judgment
on
appeal,
carter
v.
powell
on
page
14
of
her
brief,
there,
the
court
looked
also.
this
is
a
1939
case
and
the
court
there
said,
“the
statement
of
points
and
designation
of
contents
of
record
on
appeal
indicate
that
nothing
else
was
intended
to
be
relied
on
by
appellants
in
this
court.
under
the
new
rule
cited,
the
appellants
were
not
required
to
and
did
not
appeal
from
the
entire
judgment”.
thus,
the
courts
have
looked.
in
that
case,
they
found
after
looking
at
these
other
papers,
no
intention
to
appeal.
in
our
case,
the
court
closed
is
eyes
to
the
other
papers.
one,
final
area
of
issues
is
that
involving
the
question
of
whether
the
complaint
as
it
stood
was
sufficient
to
base
a
claim
for
recovery
in
quantum
meruit.
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
themselves
to
this.
i
would
like
to
quote
merely
a
few
brief
lines
which
give
us
the
rules
in
this
area.
this
court
in
conley
versus
gibson
said,
“the
accepted
rule
--
the
accepted
rule
is
that
a
complaint
should
not
be
dismissed
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
unless
it
appears
beyond
doubt
that
plaintiff
can
prove
no
set
of
facts
in
support
of
his
claim
which
would
entitle
to
relief.
in
hodges
v.
renfroe
which
we
cite
on
page
34
of
our
brief,
“it
is
the
duty
of
the
court
to
grant
the
relief
to
which
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
irrespective
of
the
prayer
for
relief”.
this
reflects
rule
54
(c)
which
says,
“every
final
judgment
shall
grant
the
relief
to
which
the
party
and
whose
favor
is
rendered
is
entitled
even
if
the
party
has
not
commanded
such
relief
in
his
pleadings.
mr.
milton
bordwin
that's
right.
mr.
milton
bordwin
no,
that
was
raised
on
the
courts
only.
mr.
milton
bordwin
in
our
petition
for
rehearing,
we
cited
the
--
this
line
of
cases
which
said,
you
look
out
--
you
must
--
you
can
look
outside
of
the
notice
of
appeal
--
mr.
milton
bordwin
--
because
in
those
cases,
the
only
mention
in
the
notice
of
appeal
was
the
denial
of
post
judgment
motions.
this
was
the
essence
of
our
petition
for
the
--
mr.
milton
bordwin
yes
sir.
mr.
milton
bordwin
yes
sir.
mr.
milton
bordwin
that's
right.
in
any
event,
i
say
that
the
intention
of
the
appellant
which
if
there
is
a
proper
manifestation
in
the
file
of
such
intention,
that
is
what
governs
the
scope
of
appeal.
this
case
then
in
summary
simply
involves
the
plaintiff's
right
to
have
a
case
heard
on
the
merits
since
it
was
here
possible
without
any
judicial
strain
on
the
court's
own
terms.
the
immediate
issue
involves
construction
of
certain
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
that
will
depend
in
turn
on
this
court's
attitude
toward
the
rules
and
the
rule
of
procedure
in
the
courts.
this
court
has
stated
again
in
conley
and
gibson,
“the
federal
rules
reject
the
approach
that
pleading
is
a
game
of
skill
in
which
one
misstep
by
counsel
maybe
decisive
to
the
outcome
and
accept
the
principle
that
the
purpose
of
pleading
is
to
facilitate
a
proper
decision
on
the
merits”.
this
we
submit
was
disregarded
by
the
lower
courts
where
they
have
the
choice
of
59
or
60.
they
chose
the
choice
that
foreclosed
the
hearing
on
the
merits.
they
will
wear
of
alternative
results
but
this
played
no
part
in
their
coming
to
a
decision.
on
the
intention
to
appeal,
we
submit,
this
is
clear
in
our
case
than
in
any
of
the
cases
we've
cited
to
the
courts
below
and
to
this
court.
and
yet,
the
court
not
only
says
your
intention
must
appear
from
the
second
notice
of
appeal
or
not
at
all.
they
have
disregarded
the
obvious.
and
third,
we
say
that
the
wrong
stated
is
the
essence
of
the
complaint
and
the
wrong
is
stated
in
our
complaint.
moneys
were
extended,
services
were
rendered
for
the
benefit
of
the
decedent.
at
least
a
quantum
meruit
recovery
was
--
should've
been
here
allowed.
in
conclusion,
i
would
merely
say
that
the
plaintiff
mrs.
foman
is
no
lawyer
and
she
will
understand
little
of
what
has
happened
in
the
case
so
far.
all
we
can
tell
her
is
that
through
the
ingenuity
of
a
federal
judge,
she
has
been
denied
her
day
in
court
for
no
good
reason
as
far
as
we
can
see.
if
these
decisions
below
are
committed
to
stand,
they
will
constitute
a
travesty
on
justice
and
in
view
of
development
of
the
federal
rules
a
long
step
into
the
past.
thank
you
for
your
attention.
mr.
milton
bordwin
just
three
small
points.
one
is
a
point
that
we
address
ourselves
to
in
our
brief.
mr.
shaine
has
said
that
if
the
first
motion
is
a
60
motion,
the
court
of
--
the
district
court
is
ousted
of
jurisdiction
and
then
how
can
it
rule
on
the
motions.
in
our
brief,
we
answer
this
in
two
ways.
first,
the
courts
that
have
addressed
themselves
to
the
question
say
that
the
district
court
retains
jurisdiction
to
consider
and
deny
such
motions
even
after
a
notice
of
appeal
has
been
filed.
second,
is
the
general
plenary
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
enables
appellate
courts
to
dispose
of
the
entire
case
and
since
we
have
rulings
by
the
district
court
on
these
motions,
it
becomes
really
irrelevant
in
that
sense
as
to
whether
it
had
jurisdiction
strictly
because
this
court
surely
will
not
send
it
back
for
a
ruling
that
has
already
been
made.
on
the
second
point,
my
brother
says
that
the
quantum
meruit
issue
and
that
is
whether
the
original
complaint
stated
a
cause
of
action
in
quantum
meruit
was
not
raised
to
the
court
of
appeals.
if
the
court
will
notice
page
15
of
our
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
copies
of
which
were
furnished
to
the
court.
page
15,
part
b
begins
in
our
complaint.
the
appellant
sets
forth
a
state
of
facts
under
which
if
she
could
not
recover
for
a
breach
of
an
expressed
oral
agreement,
she
nevertheless
could
recover
upon
a
quantum
meruit.
this
is
a
sub-question
under
our
--
in
the
way
our
brief
is
set
up,
that
is
we
say
we
have
the
right
to
amend
being
the
central
question,
the
first
sub-question
being
that
there
was
no
need
to
amend,
the
court
have
stated
a
cause
of
action.
the
final
point
is
that
--
is
on
this
defendant
decedent
issue.
the
defendant
here
--
actually,
there
are
two
defendants.
the
defendant
here
if
the
court
will
note
page
1
which
starts
--
states
the
name
of
the
case
is
the
good
effect
and
credits
of
wilbur
w.
davis
etcetera.
it's
an
estate.
there
is
a
defendant
who
is
an
individual
but
she
appears
solely
in
her
legal
representative
capacity
as
executrix
and
it
seems
completely
out
of
line
to
believe
that
she
would
have
any
connection
with
the
facts
underlying
the
case
because
she
doesn't
appear
here
in
her
individual
capacity,
so
references
to
the
defendant
are
even
taking
my
brother's
point
of
view,
references
to
the
estate.
finally,
i
want
simply
to
say
that
the
references
to
the
district
court
argument
would
not
seem
to
us
to
be
relevant
here.
i
cannot
refute
them
as
i
was
not
there.
all
we
have
to
go
on
is
the
memorandum
opinion
of
the
court
and
the
papers
in
the
file.
thank
you
again.
