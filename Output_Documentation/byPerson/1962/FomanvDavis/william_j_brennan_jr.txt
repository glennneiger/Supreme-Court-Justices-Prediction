well,
i
don't
quite
understand
mr.
shaine,
this
--
does
this
go
to
the
merits
on
the
appeal,
what's
this
got
to
do
with
the
issue
before
us
whether
it
was
proper
to
dismiss
this
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
you
mean
this
is
a
second
point
in
addition
to
the
one
on
the
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
that's
the
--
it's
the
support
point
raised
from
these
questions
presented,
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
mr.
shaine,
if
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
in
dismissing
the
appeal,
we
don't
have
to
reach
this
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
in
the
merits
in
the
appeal
including
this
point
i
would
suppose
that
this
were
before
the
court
of
appeals.
