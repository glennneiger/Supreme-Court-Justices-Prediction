mr.
roland
e.
shaine
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
best
way
for
me
to
get
out
the
differences
between
the
parties
here
is
to
take
up
two
illustrations
of
--
from
the
presentation
of
my
brother.
for
example,
in
the
matter
of
the
application
of
rule
59
or
rule
60,
it's
presented
to
the
court
as
a
simple
matter
of
let
us
say,
case.
this
view,
however,
is
to
disregard
the
integral
path
of
the
differences
in
those
rules
and
the
parts
that
they
are
to
play
in
the
appellate
system
as
set
up
by
the
statute
and
filled
out
by
the
rules.
the
fist
step
required
by
the
statutes
in
taking
an
appeal
in
the
federal
courts
is
of
course
to
have
a
final
judgment.
now
the
concept
of
a
final
judgment
long
precedes
the
promulgations
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
for
example,
in
baltimore
contractors
inc.
against
bodinger
in
19
--
decided
by
this
court
in
1955,
the
court
reaches
that
to
a
decision
in
1891,
mclish
against
roff
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
11.
to
point
out
the
policy
of
the
statutes
in
the
matter
of
finality
of
judgment
to
have
the
whole
case
and
every
matter
in
controversy
in
it,
decided
in
a
single
appeal.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
yes,
i
was.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
now,
the
counsel
is
correct
in
that
the
intimation
of
this
issue
was
first
made
by
one
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
that
is
correct.
now
then,
we
come
to
the
relationship
of
rules
59
and
60
in
terms
of
a
final
judgment
or
decree.
rule
59
provides
for
the
service
of
a
motion
to
alter
or
amend
judgment
within
10
days
after
the
entry
of
judgment.
and
by
the
operation
of
rule
73,
such
a
motion
would
have
the
effect
of
suspending
the
finality
of
the
judgment
with
respect
to
the
motion
under
rule
59
as
presented.
rule
60
deals
with
motions
to
relieve
from
such
matters
as
mistake,
inadvertence
excusable
neglect.
and
altogether,
different
set
of
circumstances
than
those
contemplated
by
rule
59
and
without
any
provision
for
suspending
the
finality
of
the
judgment.
now,
it
is
therefore
it
seems
to
us,
a
manifest
purpose
of
the
rules
and
the
rule
73
in
suspending
the
finality
of
a
judgment
upon
a
timely
motion
under
rule
59
to
hold
up
the
finality
of
a
case
for
that
period
of
time
in
order
to
let
--
to
reserve
to
the
trial
court
the
jurisdiction
we
wish
to
deal
with
the
matter
at
hand.
in
this
manner,
the
policy
of
a
finality
of
judgment
for
appeals
is
advanced.
and
it
is
within
this
concept
that
we
can
see
why
there
really
can
be
no
quarrel
with
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
full
context
of
the
rules
dictates
that
resort
be
made
to
the
procedure
under
rule
59
if
the
time
for
applying
for
such
motions
has
not
expired.
in
pressing
the
position
that
my
brother
has
advanced,
he
entirely
disregards
the
effect
that
such
an
application
of
the
rules
would
have
upon
his
own
case.
for
if
the
motion
to
amend
were
indeed
treated
as
coming
under
rule
50
--
rule
60,
thereby
giving
finality
to
a
judgment
of
the
district
court.
the
district
court
at
the
same
time
would
have
been
deprived
of
jurisdiction
with
which
to
deal
with
the
very
motions
that
the
plaintiff
brought
to
vacate
the
judgment
or
to
amend
the
--
and
then
to
amend
the
complaint.
because
once
there
has
been
a
final
judgment
and
appeal
has
been
--
an
effective
appeal
has
been
taken
the
jurisdiction
of
the
trial
court
is
ousted
and
invested
in
the
appellate
court.
with
regard
to
rule
59,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
our
briefs
and
in
the
opinions
of
the
court,
the
bringing
of
the
motions
by
the
plaintiff
to
vacate
judgment
and
to
amend
her
complaint,
spoken
of
as
having
been
brought,
having
been
made,
having
been
filed.
rule
59
(e)
actually
reversed
to
a
motion
to
alter
or
amend
the
judgment
shall
be
served
not
later
than
10
days
after
the
entry
of
the
judgment.
and
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
those
motions
were
actually
served
on
the
defendant
on
the
same
day
as
they
were
filed
in
the
court,
namely
december
20th,
1960.
now,
as
a
further
illustration
of
the
failure
of
the
appellant
to
come
to
grips
with
the
true
issues
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
allude
to
conley
against
gibson
of
which
my
brother
has
made
much
in
argument
as
in
his
brief.
this
reduces
itself
really
to
a
little
more
than
the
quotation
of
a
nice
sounding
language
from
cases
that
have
no
application,
added
to
by
the
citation
of
cases
which
are
only
within
the
general
area
of
the
issues
before
the
court.
it
is
true
that
conley
against
gibson
says
that
the
federal
rules
reject
the
approach
that
pleading
is
a
game
of
skill,
and
certainly,
the
appellee
subscribes
to
that
but
conley
against
gibson
is
really
not
authority
in
this
case
because
conley
against
gibson
dealt
purely
and
simply
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
the
complaint
in
that
case
did
or
did
not
set
forth
a
sufficient
cause
of
action.
now,
to
proceed
to
a
further
point
in
the
same
order
as
my
brother,
my
brother
has
discussed
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
original
complaint
comprehended
an
action
in
quantum
meruit.
to
be
sure,
that
problem
was
not
before
the
court
of
appeals
anymore
than
it
is
before
this
court.
my
brother,
however,
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
does
not
allude
to
this
issue
at
all.
there
is
a
very
simple
sufficient
explanation
of
that
fact
and
that
is
just
as
in
the
appellant's
brief
before
this
court
at
pages
32
and
35,
so
in
the
district
court
on
the
argument
on
the
defendant's
motion
to
dismiss,
the
plaintiff
quite
deliberately
presented
her
case
as
setting
forth
one
claim
and
one
claim
only
and
that
was
an
action
on
the
alleged
oral
contract.
it
is
explicit
in
her
complaint.
it
was
explicit
in
her
argument
of
the
motion
before
the
court
and
it
is
as
far
as
the
memorandum
of
decision
of
the
district
court
is
concerned,
it
took
--
it
did
nothing
more
than
take
the
plaintiff,
appellant
and
their
word
and
in
good
faith
proceeds
accordingly.
now,
the
next
matter
with
which
my
brother
dealt
is
the
content
of
her
motion
to
amend
set
forth
in
page
10
of
the
record.
i
wish
to
make
it
abundantly
clear
that
the
error
to
which
my
brother
referred
is
not
in
the
reproduction
of
that
motion
to
amend
or
rather
the
proposed
amendment
as
set
forth
in
the
transcript
of
the
record.
there
was
no
print
as
--
error
there
at
all.
the
proposed
amendment
as
it
appears
in
the
printed
transcript
is
exactly
as
it
was
presented
to
the
district
court.
and
it
is
apparent
from
a
reading
of
the
proposed
second
cause
of
action
that
what
the
plaintiff
was
there
proposing
by
way
of
amendment
was
a
claim
in
quantum
meruit
not
for
services
rendered
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
decedent
which
was
in
general,
the
concern
of
the
original
complaint
but
for
the
payment
of
money
and
the
rendition
of
services
for
and
on
behalf
of
elvira
a.
davis.
now,
if
we
--
we
cannot
dispose
of
this
in
the
manner
that
my
brother
has
so
far
as
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
concerned.
the
court
didn't
go
into
the
question.
it
took
the
motion
as
a
self-style
amendment
by
adding
a
second
cause
of
action.
and
that
was
as
far
as
the
court
of
appeals
had
to
go
for
its
purposes.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
this
your
honor,
is
the
key
to
the
appellee's
point
on
this
and
that
i
believe
explains
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals,
that
the
argument
before
the
district
court,
defendant
raised
the
inadequacy
of
the
motion
to
amend
in
this
respect.
the
plaintiff
shows
to
make
light
of
it
and
say
that
there
was
no
mistake
and
insistent
that
there
was
no
mistake.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
that
is
correct.
the
opportunity
existed
then
and
there
for
the
plaintiff
to
have
(inaudible)
it
out.
the
plaintiff
for
her
own
reasons
chose
to
leave
the
dilemma
with
the
court,
and
the
court
obviously
was
entitled
to
consider
it
as
the
inadequate
motion
to
amend
that
it
was.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
the
original
complaint
your
honor.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
it
says
that
in
paragraph
2
--
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
the
defendant,
that's
elvira
a.
davis.
paragraph
1,
your
honor,
says
the
defendant
is
elvira
a.
davis.
paragraph
2
says
the
defendant
and
that
is
to
say
elvira
a.
davis,
owes
the
plaintiff
$12,500.
the
money
is
paid
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
defendant.
now,
the
defendant
properly
raised
this
as
one
ground
of
objection
to
allowance
of
the
proposed
motion
and
the
court
turned
to
the
plaintiff
for
explanation
or
discussion
or
whatever
else
might
have
been
expected.
the
plaintiff
score
on
the
issue
all
together.
now,
we
submit
that
it
is
not
an
abusive
discretion
for
a
district
court
under
these
circumstances
to
refuse
to
allow
a
motion
to
amend
which
to
say
the
very
least
would
have
to
be
amended
again.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
well,
the
appellant,
your
honor,
claims
that
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
denying
that
motion
to
amend
by
setting
forth
this
second
cause
of
action.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
yes.
that
is
to
say,
under
the
rules,
we
were
concerned
with
whether
or
not
the
motion
to
vacate
and
the
motion
to
amend
neither
did
not
suspend
the
finality
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
that's
right
sir.
and
that's
why
i
say,
that
it
re
--
it
comes
right
to
the
issue.
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
it
must
transfer
itself
to
the
situation
with
which
the
trial
court
was
confronted.
the
party's
litigant
appeared
before
the
court
and
invites
the
court's
attention
to
a
particular
aspect
of
the
case
by
virtue
of
papers
and
motions
which
are
filed
with
the
court
and
it
is
for
the
court
to
try
to
govern
the
procedure
along
sensible
line.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
i
would
say
that's
true.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
although,
your
honor,
perhaps
i'm
not
doing
justice
to
the
appellant
in
that
respect.
i
suppose
that
in
fact
--
and
this
really
again
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals
upon
further
reflection.
the
fact
is
that
what
the
appellant
wants
here
is
consideration
of
the
propriety
of
the
dismissal
of
the
appeal
because
it
didn't
set
forth
a
cause
of
action
which
is
one
point.
then
if
it
goes
back
say
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
holds
that
the
district
court
was
correct
in
that
respect,
the
appellant
plaintiff
would
then
want
to
be
heard
on
the
propriety
of
the
denial
of
its
motion
to
vacate
and
amend.
perhaps
it
would
want
a
ruling
on
that
anyway
to
enlarge
that
grounds
on
which
it
would
go
before
a
jury.
but
this
of
course
is
--
comes
right
to
the
heart
of
the
position
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
second
notice
of
appeal
to
raise
anything
more
than
the
question
of
the
abusive
discretion
by
the
district
court
in
denying
the
motion
to
vacate
and
to
amend.
and
again,
i
brought
to
what
i
consider
to
be
an
essence
in
the
issues
which
my
brother
has
chose
to
disregard.
in
his
resort
to
the
language
such
as
he
quoted
from
conley
against
gibson
about
that
rules
not
being
a
game.
of
course,
they're
not
a
game
but
a
well
ordered
system
of
procedure
also
is
important
for
the
promotion
of
justice,
and
to
paraphrase
the
language
of
the
court
of
the
third
circuit
in
healy
against
pennsylvania
railroad.
we
are
not
oblivious
of
the
trend
away
from
a
nice
and
easy
procedure
but
we
do
not
feel
that
we
are
asking
this
court
to
decide
these
questions
on
the
basis
of
barren
formal
technicality.
we
say
that
it
is
of
the
highest
importance
that
the
appellate
function
be
free
of
jurisdictional
doubts
when
they
can
be
so
simply
avoided
by
compliance
with
a
few
specific
requirements
of
the
federal
statutes
and
the
federal
rules.
now,
to
come
to
the
next
point
with
which
my
brother
dealt.
again,
on
the
issue
of
the
abuse
by
the
district
court
of
this
discretion
in
denying
the
motions
to
vacate
and
amend,
(inaudible)
my
brother
takes
the
premise
that
the
district
court
was
bound
to
follow
cleaves
against
kenny
decided
in
1933
by
the
first
circuit
prior
to
healy
against
railroad
and
by
a
divided
court.
as
was
brought
out
by
a
question
from
justice
douglas,
this
case
of
course
is
purely
and
simply
a
diversity
jurisdiction
case.
the
question
--
the
basic
question
of
law
is
one
of
massachusetts
law,
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
massachusetts
statute
of
frauds
in
this
regard.
a
district
court
of
course
is
not
bound
to
follow
a
--
an
earlier
determination
by
a
court
of
appeals
on
the
matter
of
the
interpretation
or
application
of
a
state
statute
as
was
said
by
this
court
in
thompson
against
consolidated
gas
utilities
corporation
cited
at
page
23
of
our
brief.
the
federal
courts
cannot
settle
the
proper
construction
of
state
statute
and
if
we
look
at
the
memorandum
decision
of
judge
ford
in
the
case
at
bar,
we
will
see
that
judge
ford
diligently
considered
the
question
of
the
massachusetts
law
and
on
the
basis
of
decisions
since
cleaves
against
kenny
came
to
the
honest,
sincere
conclusion
that
massachusetts
law
was
not
as
the
court
of
appeals
had
annunciated
it
in
cleaves
against
kenny.
and
that
is
--
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
the
view
of
judge
ford,
it
does
happen,
coincided
with
the
minority
view
expressed
in
cleaves
against
kenny.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
yes,
he
did.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
yes,
he
did.
at
the
same
time,
your
honor,
he
referred
to
a
more
recent
massachusetts
case
as
indicating
that
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
would
not
give
the
literal
application
of
the
statute
of
frauds
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
in
cleaves
against
kenny.
but
suffice
it
to
say
that
it
is
manifest
that
judge
ford
was
attempting
properly
to
discharge
his
duties
under
erie
railroad
against
tompkins
and
particularly
where
he
is
a
district
judge
sitting
in
the
district
of
massachusetts
and
is
close
to
the
massachusetts
law.
i
think
that
it
would
--
he
is
entitled
to
be
spared
condemnation
as
having
abused
his
discretion
in
the
resolution
he
made
of
this
particular
matter.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
your
honor,
i
would
ask
that
judge
ford's
opinion
be
read
with
consideration
of
the
fact
that
he
is
the
trial
judge
who
is
disposing
of
these
matters
as
part
of
litigation
and
that
his
whole
memorandum
decision
must
be
read
as
a
whole.
and
while
it
is
true
that
he
is
quite
forthright
in
expressing
his
own
conviction
that
judge
morton
was
correct
rather
than
the
majority
in
cleaves
against
kenny.
he
does
say
that
the
--
in
the
second
to
last
paragraph
of
his
opinion
on
page
8
of
the
transcript.
the
only
recent
interpretation
of
section
5
by
the
massachusetts
courts
in
west
against
trust
company,
328
massachusetts
which
is
a
fairly
recent
decision.
the
--
indicates
that
the
massachusetts
court
would
not
adopt
the
strictly
literal
construction
of
the
majority
in
the
cleaves
case.
now
i
think
--
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
this
is
not
on
the
merits
and
should
not
be
considered
on
the
merits.
its
pertinence
is
that
my
brother
has
adduced
cleaves
against
kenny
as
an
example
of
how
the
district
court
abused
his
discretion
because
it
denied
--
it
leave
to
amend
when
it
had
failed
to
follow
a
decision
which
my
brother
presents
as
having
bound
the
district
court.
i
am
suggesting
that
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
district
court
on
that
respect
because
the
district
court
was
not
bound
to
follow
cleaves
against
kenny
because
cleaves
against
kenny
could
not
settle
anything
if
there
were
subsequent
massachusetts
law.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
because
--
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
--
if
it
goes
back
to
the
--
if
it
goes
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
question
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint
and
the
court
of
appeals
goes
along
with
judge
ford
and
holds
that
massachusetts
law
would
not
have
entitled
this
plaintiff
to
a
recovery.
then
there
is
still
the
question
as
to
whether
the
court
should,
the
trial
court
should
or
should
not
have
allowed
the
plaintiff's
motion
to
amend.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
well,
to
be
sure,
that's
true.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
well,
i
know
that
if
i
were
trying
a
plaintiff's
case,
i
would
want
to
go
on
a
jury
with
a
two-prong
complaint
would
account
such
as
was
set
forth
in
the
original
action
and
one
in
quantum
meruit
because
if
i
didn't
satisfy
the
jury
if
it
was
a
contract,
at
least,
i
would
want
to
recover
in
quantum
meruit.
but
perhaps,
this
court
should
contempt
itself
with
the
issue
of
the
--
whether
the
court
was
correct,
the
circuit
court
was
correct
in
holding
that
the
merits
were
not
brought
before
it
by
either
the
first
or
the
second
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
yes
your
honor.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
yes
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
that
is
correct.
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
that
is
correct.
when
i
said
about
--
that
they
haven't
ruled
on
the
merits,
i
meant
with
respect
to
the
--
mr.
roland
e.
shaine
--
the
judgment
dismissing
the
complaint.
that
is
correct.
my
time
has
expired.
