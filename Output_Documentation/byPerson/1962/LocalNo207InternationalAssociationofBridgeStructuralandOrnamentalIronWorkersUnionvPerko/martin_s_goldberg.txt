mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
court.
this
situation
in
my
way
of
thinking
is
comparable
to
a
wrestling
match
when
one
of
the
opponent
strikes
the
other
one
below
the
belt
and
when
the
referee
looks
at
him,
he
said,
“i
didn't
do
a
thing”
and
that's
just
what
happened
in
our
trial
court.
the
union
denied
doing
anything.
they
didn't
present
any
evidence
that
the
activity
that
they
participated
in
was
a
protected
concerted
activity.
they
pled
a
defensive
concerted
activity,
but
they
didn't
bring
any
evidence
in
at
all.
now,
it
strikes
me
that
in
order
for
there
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice,
there
must
be
a
coercion
or
intimidation
of
rights
that
are
protected
under
the
act.
29
u.s.
code
section
152
specifically
exempts
supervisors
from
the
operation
of
the
act.
the
act
deals
with
employees
and
supervisors
are
not
employees
according
to
the
plain
simple
language
of
the
act.
and
i
feel
that
because
of
his
being
exempted
from
the
act,
they
must
show
that
this
was
a
protected,
concerted
activity.
now,
the
record
clearly
shows
they
--
the
record
clearly
shows
that
they
had
no
right
under
their
own
constitution
to
take
away
mr.
perko's
foreman's
rights.
he
needed
his
foreman's
rights
in
order
to
act
as
a
superintendent
and
he
was
a
superintendent,
the
record
is
clear
as
to
that
on
that
day
that
the
trouble
started
with
his
own
union.
there's
no
question
about
his
being
a
superintendent
supervising
the
different
crafts
that
work
under
five
different
crafts.
now,
if
they
violated
their
own
constitution,
section
45
of
their
own
constitution
that
they
had
no
right
to
deprive
him
of
his
foreman's
rights.
they
say
we
didn't
do
it
and
yet
the
evidence
and
the
facts
the
jury
found
that
they
did
do
it
because
he
couldn't
give
orders
to
his
men.
that
can't
be
deemed
as
a
type
of
activity
that
would
encourage
membership
if
they
violate
their
own
constitution.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
why
sir?
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
the
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
your
honor,
mr.
perko
operated
under
the
orders
of
his
company.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
he
was
directed
to
assign
certain
types
of
work
to
certain
crafts.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
in
other
words,
a
boilermaker's
craft
would
participate
in
certain
activity,
the
iron
workers
and
others.
acting
pursuant
to
the
general
company
direction,
he
assigned
each
craft
to
its
different
job.
the
structural
iron
workers
filed
a
complaint
after
the
matter
have
been
arbitrated
by
a
joint
labor
management
arbitration
committee
and
resolved
in
favor
of
the
company.
the
iron
workers
decided
that
they
were
going
to
file
charges
against
mr.
perko
and
it's
very
interesting
to
note
that
these
charges
were
filed,
prepared
and
filed
against
him
on
december
the
4th
that
accused
him
of
committing
acts
that
happened
on
december
the
6th,
claiming
that
he
was
assisting
the
boilermakers.
that
was
the
basis
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
--
of
their
--
having
a
union
trial
and
fining
him.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
well
i
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
in
order
--
i'm
sorry,
in
order
to
function
as
a
superintendent,
he
would
of
necessity
have
to
give
orders
to
the
foreman
of
the
various
crafts.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
now,
that's,
that's
set
out
in
the
record.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
no,
he
does
not.
he
does
not.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
he
happened
to
be
a
member
of
the
structural
iron
workers
union.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
he
happened
to
be
a
member
of
the
structural
iron
workers
union
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
and
a
foreman
would
not
take
orders
from
him
unless
he
had
a
member's
card.
it
boiled
down
to
that
in
actual
practice.
they
say,
“no,
he
didn't
have
to
be
a
member,
“but
an
actual
practice
as
a
practical
matter
he
had
to
have
that
foreman,
that
ability
to
give
orders
to
the
iron
workers
and
they
wouldn't
take
order
unless
he
was
a
card
carrying
member.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
in
either
case.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
no,
he
did
not,
your
honor.
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
i
don't
know.
i
know
this
that
as
a
practical
matter,
the
iron
workers
wouldn't
take
orders
from
mr.
perko
or
their
foreman
wouldn't
and
the
men
wouldn't
even
when
he
was
a
member
of
the
union.
and
they
--
they
claim
that
they
had
no
right
to
take
away
his
foreman's
rights
under
their
own
constitution.
and
yet
they're
coming
in
here
to
this
court
now
at
this
stage
and
saying,
“well
we
did
it
but
it
was
protected.”
and
i
don't
think
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
to
protect
or
immunize
unions
from
unlawful
conduct.
i
think
the
intention
of
the
taft-hartley
act
was
clearly
to
proscribe
some
of
their
activity.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
oh
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
i
think
that
the
legislative
intent
of
congress
in
the
--
in
the
taft-hartley
act
was
to
impose
some
restraints
on
union
activity.
i
don't
feel
that
it
was
all
inclusive
and
i
think
that
this
is
borne
out
by
the
subsequent
passing
of
the
landrum-griffith
act
which
clearly
spelled
out
the
right
of
a
member
to
protect
--
to
protect
his
rights.
there
might
have
been
an
area
where
there
was
some
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
congress
intended
to
permit
the
states
to
assume
jurisdiction
in
these
types
of
cases,
but
i
think
landrum-griffith
act
pretty
clearly
gives
a
member
the
right
to
protect
what
he
--
well
his
property
rights.
and
i
think
that
in
this
--
summarizing
it
in
a
more
or
less
an
outlined
form
in
this
particular
case
where
a
man
is
a
superintendent,
the
record
shows
it
clearly,
exempted
from
the
operation
of
the
act,
where
he
has
no
protective
rights
under
the
act
that
to
deprive
him
of
his
right,
his
property
right
to
seek
employment
at
his
own
will,
that
he's
capable
of
performing,
to
deprive
him
of
that
right
by
saying
that
congress
implied
that
the
state
courts
would've
been
preempted
in
this
type
of
field
without
spelling
it
out
is
to
deprive
him
of
due
process.
i
think
he
has
a
right
to
pro
--
or
he
has
--
he
should
have
a
right
to
go
to
court
to
protect
this
valuable
property
rights
and
by
taking
them
away
by
the
--
not
giving
him
a
forum
in
which
to
have
the
evidence
heard
failure,
he's
being
deprived
of
a
valuable
property
right.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
yes.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
think
that
the
board
has
the
power
to
order
that
union
to
give
him
back
his
foreman's
rights.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
that's
a
matter
of
dispute
between
him
and
his
own
union.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
oh,
i
feel
that
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
i
am
suggesting
it
strong
very
strongly
--
very
strenuously,
he
didn't
have
any
other
remedy
but
in
the
state
court
and
i
feel
that
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
your
honor,
as
i
said
before,
i
think
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice,
he
would
have
to
have
a
right
that
he's
protected
under
the
act,
and
as
a
superintendent
he
--
or
supervisor
he
doesn't.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
well,
i'm
saying
this
that
the
only
area
where
there
could
be
discrimination,
where
a
supervisor
is
fired
is
if
the
employer
fires
him
with
the
intention
of
coercing
union
in
acquire
--
coming
into
a
plant
or
encouraging
or
discouraging
membership.
but
i
don't
feel
that
by
an
activity
that
was
started
by
the
union,
more
or
less
compelling
the
employer
to
let
him
go
that
they
can
come
in
here
and
claim
that
what
they
were
trying
to
do
is
to
encourage
membership.
they
violated
their
own
constitution
in
doing
it.
there
was
no
dispute
between
management
and
the
union.
this
was
not
a
matter
relating
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
i
think
it's
clearly
outside
the
scope
of
taft-hartley
act.
i
think
that
it
is
a
matter
for
a
state
court
jurisdiction.
i
don't
think
the
taft-hartley
act,
there's
any
conflict
with
national
policy
or
any
conflict
with
the
purposes
and
the
spirit
of
the
taft-hartley
act
at
all.
i
think
the
preemption
of
--
should
apply
if
there's
--
if
there
is
conflict
but
i
can't
see
where
there
is
any
conflict
in
affording
this
man
a
form
to
protect
a
valuable
property
right.
and
i
think
that
the
doubt
has
been
resolved
by
the
landrum-griffith
act,
29
u.s.
code
section
523,
preserving
the
rights
of
members
in
the
state
courts
and
federal
courts.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
well,
no.
we
would
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
no,
no
your
--
mr.
justice
white,
we
would
not
because
he
has
separate
damages
during
this
years
that
he's
been
unable
to
get
employment
in
the
capacity
that
he's
qualified
for.
and
that
after
all
the
record
shows
that
he
worked
exclusively
for
the
pollock
company
that
at
the
time
this
happening,
he
was
making
between
$11,000
and
$12,000
a
year
as
a
supervisor.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
damages
for
the
loss
of
it
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
yes,
your
honor.
well,
i
say
that
there's
more
to
it
than
just
back
pay,
your
honor.
i
feel
that
there's
an
element
of
damage
that
he
has
lost
certain
valuable
property
right
as
a
member
of
the
union
that
the
board
is
powerless
to
give
him.
the
board
can
tell
the
company,
you
take
this
man
back
but
if
the
man
continues
to
refuse
to
take
orders
from
them,
the
board
can't
do
anything.
this
is
of
--
this
clearly
in
the
record
shows
that
it's
a
dispute
between
a
man
and
his
union.
the
taft-hartley
act
states
specifically
that
nothing
under
section
8
(a),
nothing
should
--
and
herein
provided
shall
affect
the
right
of
a
union.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
well,
your
honor,
i
say
that
it
can't
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
since
it
doesn't
cover
rights
that
are
protected
under
the
act.
what
the
activity
covered
i
think
would
fall
under
section
303
of
the
taft-hartley
act
which
deals
with
secondary
boycotts
which
would
give
mr.
perko
a
right
as
a
person
that
they
caused
his
company
that
he
is
doing
business
with
to
go
into
the
court
and
enforce
his
rights,
but
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
i
don't
think
he's
covered.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
if
that
man
is
a
supervisor,
he
is
not
an
employee
and
the
unfair
labor
practices
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
i
say
it
is
not
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
yes.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
mr.
justice
black,
i
feel
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
yes,
sir
and
my
thinking
on
that
is
that
it
comes
under
the
secondary
boycott
provision
which
would
be
section
303,
29
u.s.
code
187
which
would
be
an
interference
by
a
union
with
the
relationship
between
a
--
say
an
employer
and
someone
he's
doing
business
with.
i
feel
that
that
section
of
the
act
would
apply
and
that
section
of
the
act
clearly
gives
a
man
that
he
is
injured
that
way
the
right
to
go
into
a
federal
court
and
obtain
relief.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
sir?
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
well
no,
we're
not.
we're
suing
under
the
state
--
under
our
state
common
law,
a
higher
state
common
law,
a
wrongful
interference
with
employment
which
caused
mr.
perko
to
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
yes,
i
do.
i
think
that
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
yes,
i
do,
mr.
justice
black.
i
feel
again
that
this
is
outside
the
periphery
of
the
act.
that
the
act
wasn't
intended
to
regulate
act
--
the
rights
of
the
union
to
discipline
their
own
members
and
when
they
go
beyond
their
own
constitution
and
they
engage
and
arbitrary
conduct
that's
against
the
law,
i
feel
that
the
board
is
powerless
to
remedy
it
and
that
the
only
forum
where
he
can
get
relief
is
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
then
i'd
say
it's
a
concurrent
remedy
that
it
wouldn't
--
there
would
be
no
conflict
between
the
board
and
the
state
court.
i
feel
that
in
that
case,
we
could
have
dual
remedies
where
the
rights
could
be
enforced
in
either
form.
i
think
that
preemption
applies
only
where
there's
conflict.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
well
then
you
have
a
conflict
but
i
don't
think
that
would
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
well
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
mr.
justice
black,
the
only
way
i
could
feel
the
board
could
possibly
assume
jurisdiction
or
rule
on
the
matter
would
be
to
say
that
this
is
a
protected
activity
of
the
union,
but
how
can
it
be
a
protected
activity
of
the
union
when
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
then
on
what
basis
could
they
possibly
assume
jurisdiction?
i
mean,
i
don't
know.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
the
board
would
be
going
contrary
to
the
language
of
the
act.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
yes,
that's
correct
and
i
maintain
that
they
do
not
have
the
power
and
i
maintain
that
unions
have
matured
in
age
and
size
but
i
don't
feel
that
they've
quite
yet
matured
in
responsibility
for
some
of
their
activities
and
that
the
courts
are
the
proper
forum
to
insist
that
they
do
assume
their
responsibility
for
their
activity.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
well,
your
honor,
as
an
element
of
damage,
i
think
there's
mental
suffering
that
goes
in
with
the
inability
to
work
in
a
craft
that
you've
worked
in
and
i
think
that
there
are
certain
union
rights
that
the
board
and
no
power
to
grant
mr.
perko
that
the
union
still
would
refuse
to
give
him
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
yes.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
we'd
had
--
we'd
be
stuck
with
it.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
that
would
be
about
all
we
could
ask
for,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
we're
not
asking
for
reinstatement,
mr.
justice
white.
our
client
is
76
years
old.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
no,
no
sir,
none
at
this
time.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
well,
no,
sir.
we're
act
--
we're
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
mr.
perko's
on
--
at
this
stage
of
the
game
would
not
be
working
at
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
that's
right
for
a
completed
tort
--
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
martin
s.
goldberg
i
want
to
thank
the
court
for
their
indulgence.
this
has
been
my
first
time
hearing
that.
