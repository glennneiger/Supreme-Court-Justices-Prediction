justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
it
would
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union,
out
of
knowledge
or
legal
knowledge
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
a
person
to
lose
his
job
as
a
foreman
on
the
ground
that
they
didn't
want
to
work
with
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
he
--
whether
he's
an
employee
or
not,
i'm
talking
now
about
the
activity
of
the
union
in
bringing
about
a
man's
discharged
wrongfully.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
union,
but
a
vice
president
of
the
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
got
mad
at
the
vice
president
of
the
company
and
decided
they
wanted
to
him
to
lose
his
job
and
they
proceeded
and
say
they
wouldn't
work
under
him.
would
that
be
or
would
it
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know,
i'm
asking
you
for
your
answer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
you're
suing
under
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
you
are
suing
under?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
suppose
the
union
does
wrongfully
interfere
with
the
employee
even
though
he's
not
employee
in
the
technical
union
of
the
act,
you
still
say
that
the
board
would
have
no
jurisdiction
to
anything
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
you
maybe
right,
i'm
just
trying
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
are
wrong
on
that
and
the
board
does
have
power,
what
would
be
your
position
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
decided
differently.
one
decided
they've
done
it
wrongful
and
one
decided
they
haven't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
would
certainly
have
a
potential
conflict
whether
they
actually
mix
those
contradictory
decisions
or
not.
that
is
assuming,
i'm
not
saying
that
that's
the
case
here
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
assuming
as
i
asked
you
the
question
that
the
board
does
have
power,
jurisdiction
and
remedies
at
some
way,
you
have
to
have
a
potential
conflict
if
you
allowed
a
suit
to
be
filed
in
the
state,
do
you
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
cited
it
once
for
the
protected
activity
of
the
union.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
suppose,
suppose
they
realize
the
evidence
that
we
had
argued
with
the
meaning
of
what
the
language
you
used,
suppose
they
held
that
the
union
was
committing
a
wrong
which
the
board
had
power
to
redress
and
then
would
you
say
that
the
state
remedy
was
concurrent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then
--
then
you
would
say
they
don't
have
the
--
that
gets
back
to
the
question
where
they
have
the
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
made
one
statement.
you
said
that
you
couldn't
get
all
the
damages
even
if
the
board
had
the
right
but
you
wouldn't
get
all
the
damages
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
merely
because
they
paid
him
his
back
pay.
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
congress
had
decided,
assuming
now
contrary
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
your
view
point,
it
had
decided
that
the
board
did
have
jurisdiction
to
give
a
remedy
and
give
damages
and
it
had
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
only
damage
that
should
be
allowed
would
be
the
back
pay,
what
would
be
your
answer
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
stuck
with
it?
