mr.
david
e.
feller
may
it
please
the
court,
chief
justice.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
that
court
had
refused
review
of
a
judgment
in
the
trial
court,
and
affirmed
by
intermediate
appellate
court
for
the
plaintiff,
who
is
the
respondent
here,
against
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner
--
or
petitioners
are
local
207
of
the
structural
ironworkers
union
and
its
officers
who
are
sued
as
representatives
of
its
members,
being
a
class
alleged
in
the
complaint
to
be
too
numerous
to
name
in
the
complaint.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
case
is
here
after
a
jury
verdict
for
the
plaintiff,
my
statement
of
the
facts
will
necessarily
assume
all
doubtful
questions
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
and
in
making
that
assumption,
the
facts
are
substantially
as
follows.
the
plaintiff,
a
man
named
perko,
something
over
65
years
of
age
was
working
as
a
superintendent
for
the
william
pollock
company,
a
construction
company
in
ohio.
he
did
construction
work
of
various
kinds,
the
kind
this
man
worked
on
involved
the
erection
and
demolition
and
repair
of
glass
for
instance.
the
plaintiff
was
an
iron
worker,
but
he
worked
for
the
pollock
company
alternately
as
a
foreman
and
as
a
superintendent.
to
avoid
confusion,
i'd
like
to
start
out
right
at
the
beginning
of
this
case
to
explain
the
use
of
those
terms
in
this
case.
as
these
jobs
are
done
there
is
a
sup
--
they
involved
several
crafts.
there'll
be
iron
workers,
boilermakers,
carpenters,
electricians.
the
superintendent
is
in
charge
of
the
job
and
supervises
all
the
crafts.
then
there
are
foreman
for
each
craft.
now
the
foreman,
as
this
term
is
used
in
this
practice
in
ohio,
is
not
a
supervisor,
now
here
claimed
to
be
a
supervisor.
he
is
really
a
straw
boss,
he's
more
frequently
called
the
pusher,
i
think
the
records
shows.
he
receives
the
orders
from
the
superintendent
and
working
with
the
other
men,
directs
their
activities;
i
think
in
an
industrial
plant
we'd
call
him
a
gang
leader.
in
any
case,
the
plaintiff
was
working
as
a
superintendent
on
a
job
building
or
reconstructing
a
blast
furnace
for
the
ohio
works
of
u.s.
steel,
working
for
the
pollock
company
as
a
superintendent
with
several
crafts
working
for
him.
he
--
during
the
period
of
his
job,
a
jurisdictional
dispute
arose
between
the
iron
workers
and
the
boilermakers.
as
a
matter
of
fact
during
his
--
during
the
immediate
period
when
the
facts
here
occurred
there
were
no
iron
workers
working
on
this
job,
where
the
plaintiff
was
working,
but
they
were
working
on
another
job
for
the
same
company
and
they
--
the
claim
was
that,
mr.
perko
was
assigning
or
instructing
boilermakers
in
iron
workers'
work.
and
the
union,
in
fact,
shut
down
the
other
job,
where
they
had
people
working
in
the
hubber
job
and
this
company
at
this
job,
and
the
ohio
works
job,
they
shut
down
operations.
the
company
voluntarily
shut
down
until
the
matter
could
be
settled.
the
dispute
then
went
to
a
jurisdiction
committee,
a
local
jurisdiction
committee
and
they
said
that
part
of
the
work
was
boilermakers'
work
to
work
in
dispute
on
the
job
on
which
perko
was
working.
part
of
the
work
was
iron
workers'
work.
the
rigging
part
was
iron
workers'
work.
and
the
day
after
that
the
ironworkers
were
called
out
to
work
on
the
job
where
perko
was
superintendent.
at
or
about
the
same
time,
charges
were
filed
against
mr.
perko
in
the
ironworkers
union,
although
he
was
a
superintendent
he
was
a
member
of
the
ironworkers
union,
charging
him
with
having
violated
the
union
law
against
instructing
boilermakers
in
the
trade
or
craft
of
the
ironworkers.
and
when
the
ironworkers
showed
up
on
this
job
the
day
after
the
agreement
in
jurisdictional
dispute
committee
which
was
then
subsequently
appealed
further,
but
that's
of
no
moment;
the
iron
workers
refused
to
take
orders
from
mr.
perko.
mr.
perko
--
the
orders
were
in
fact
given
by
the
field
superintendent
who
was
yet
at
a
higher
level
of
supervision.
mr.
perko
was
retained
on
the
payroll
for
some
period
of
time
and
subsequently
when
the
job
was
completed
he
was
let
go.
ordinarily
in
this
business,
you
work
only
for
the
duration
of
a
job
and
the
record
so
shows
but
in
any
case
he
was
let
go
and
his
complaint
was
that
he
was
never
rehired
as
a
superintendent
or
as
a
foreman,
either
by
the
pollock
company
his
immediate
employer
or
by
any
other
employer
in
this
area
because
he
claimed
that
the
union
had
in
its
disciplinary
procedure
taken
away
his
foreman's
rights.
there's
no
ever,
ever
evidence
that
this
actually
happened,
but
the
claim
was
that
the
union,
as
part
of
this
controversy
arising
out
of
the
[inaudible]
dispute,
had
prevented
him
from
obtaining
employment
as
a
superintendent
or
as
a
foreman
and
by
foreman,
i
mean
pusher.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
gather
he
worked
--
the
record
shows
that
he
worked
for
12
or
13
years
and
he
worked
sometimes
as
a
foreman
and
sometimes
as
a
superintendent.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
gather
that
that
he
was
for
12
or
13
years.
the
record
on
page
22
says
that
he
was
employed
as
a
superintendent
and
a
foreman.
there
would
be
times,
the
answer
from
the
pollock
company
representatives
was
probably
when
work
was
slow
that
he
would
work
in
a
gang
or
work
as
an
iron
worker.
but
as
a
rule
as
a
foreman
or
a
superintendent,
so
he
was
an
employee
some
of
the
time,
a
plain
ordinary
employee,
he
was
a
pusher
type
employer,
a
foreman
some
other
time
and
he
was
a
superintendent
other
times.
the
record
also
shows
that
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
the
record
doesn't
really
say
much
on
that,
if
your
honor
please,
though
it
does
show,
again,
i
don't
know
that
anybody
has
made
anything
of
this
subject,
the
president
of
the
local
union
on
page
111
of
the
record
testified
without
contradiction
as
to
what
the
practice
was.
and
he
says
one
of
construction
job
is
completed
of
what
happens
to
the
men,
it's
at
the
bottom
of
page
111,
he
says,
“it
is
payday.”
question,
“everybody
is
laid
off?
yes,
sir.
is
this
true
as
to
the
men
who
had
been
engaged
in
the
capacity
of
a
foreman?
is
it
true
about
foreman?
yes.”
yes,
generally
it
is
true
too.
mr.
david
e.
feller
no
he's
not
had
a
job
with
pollock
since
or
anywhere
else
for
that
matt
--
well
he's
had
--
no,
correction.
he
has
had
jobs
in
subsequent
years
all
of
which
terminated
for
one
reason
or
other
before
he
earned
$1,200.
he
was
receiving
certain
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
again
i
have
to
suspend
my
judgment
as
to
what
the
record
shows
since
the
jury
found
damages.
but
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
ohio
found
in
this
case,
the
only
evidence
actually
that
he
ever
asked
for
a
job
was
his
evidence
and
he
only
asked
for
a
job,
he
said
only
at
pollock
and
that
one
other
company,
the
american
bridge
company
and
american
bridge
witness
testified
that
he
hadn't
asked
for
a
job
there.
mr.
david
e.
feller
yes.
actually,
the
court
of
appeals,
i
go
through
the
procedure,
expressed
grave
doubt
as
to
whether
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
oh,
no.
it
doesn't
hurt
me
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'd
be
pleased
to
admit
it
except
for
the
fact
that
i
have
a
whole
history
of
the
litigation.
in
any
case,
the
plaintiff
brought
suit
claiming
he
was
deprived
of
his
right
to
work
as
a
foreman
or
as
a
superintendent,
and
this
constitutes
a
conspiracy
which
was
a
common
law
tort
for
which
he
was
entitled
to
recover
damages.
the
union
moved
to
dismiss
on
two
grounds;
first
that
since
he
was
complaining
about
union
disciplinary
action
he
hadn't
exhausted
his
remedies
within
the
union;
and
second,
that
the
acts
complained
of
if
and
they
in
fact
occurred
constituted
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
therefore,
was
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
the
trial
court
sustained
the
motion
on
the
first
ground,
on
the
exhaustion
of
remedies
ground,
and
this
has
significance
for
the
preemption
point
later.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
without
opinion
and
then
the
case
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
first
time.
and
that
court
reversed
in
its
opinion
quite
clearly
said
that
on
the
exhaustion
point
that
plaintiff
and
i
am
quoting,
“is
not
attempting
to
secure
any
redress
for
loss
of
rights
as
a
member
of
the
union.
he
is
not
seeking
reinstatement,
he
is
not
asking
for
equitable
relief,
he
is
suing
for
a
common
law
tort,
and
therefore,
he
was
not
required
to
exhaust
his
remedies
within
the
union.
then
it
addressed
itself
to
the
second
argument
and
again,
here
its
words
are
worth
quoting.
the
court
said,
very
simply,
without
much
discussion,
“that
the
national
labor
relations
board
does
not
have
such
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
an
action
to
recover
damages
for
a
common
law
tort
which
is
also
when
unfair
labor
practice
prescribed
by
the
act
as
to
preclude
a
state
remedy.”
citing
what
then
appeared
to
be
cases
which
were
believed
in
some
quarters
to
hold
that.
and
that
is
the
decision
to
this
court
in
the
gonzales
case
and
in
roberno
--
and
in
the
russell
case.
and
though
not
citing
it,
the
ca
--
the
garmon
case
first
time
around
in
this
court
in
which
this
court
sent
the
case
back
to
the
california
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
damages
would
lie
under
state
law.
that
was
the
court's
opinion;
that
the
--
that
really
is
the
ruling
law
of
this
case
as
far
as
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
is
concerned;
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
does
not
preclude
a
state
court
from
granting
damages
in
a
tort
action
for
an
unfair
labor
practice.
so
the
case
went
back
for
trial
in
the
district
--
in
the
trial
court.
this
time
the
defendants
amended
their
answer
to
also
alleged
now
that
the
action
was
protected
under
section
7
of
the
act
just
to
button
up
the
preemption
argument
on
both
end.
the
case
was
tried
and
went
to
a
jury.
the
jury
could
not
agree.
before
the
jury
retired,
the
defendants
had
moved
for
a
directed
verdict.
the
motion
had
been
denied,
and
after
the
jury
couldn't
agree,
the
motion
was
renewed
to
the
trial
court
and
the
trial
court
granted
judgment
for
the
defendants.
it
was
again
appealed
through
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
which
then
said
that
this
was
error
because
the
trial
judge
did
not
find,
as
it
then
said
the
trial
judge
had
to
find
and
this
is
apparently
the
new
law
for
ohio
in
this
case
that
there
was
no
evidence
at
all
for
the
plaintiff.
so
it
went
back
for
trial
again.
the
third
time
around
resulted
in
the
judgment
which
we
are
now
complaining
about
here.
it
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
the
intermediate
court
in
ohio
and
its
opinion
a
very
instructive
one
appears
on
pages
182
through
184
of
the
record.
and
it
had
grave
doubts
as
to
whether
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
so
there
is
very
little
that
supports
the
plaintiffs
cause
of
action
but
after
that
time
before
when
it
has
been
kicked
in
the
seat
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
it
felt
that
it
couldn't
do
anything
but
affirm
and
so
we
are
here.
now
basically,
the
question
in
this
case
is
a
very
simple
one,
and
i
think
already
decided
by
this
court
and
that
is
whether
actions
of
a
union
with
regard
to
the
affecting
the
employment
of
the
plaintiff
here
are
to
be
tested
and
judged,
and
damages
to
be
awarded
under
the
common
law
of
conspiracy
to
the
way
this
case
was
brought
and
which
in
the
way
the
jury
was
instructed;
the
common
law
of
conspiracy
or
under
the
standards
for
concerted
action
established
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
actually,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
which
--
its
first
opinion
is
the
law
of
this
case
up
to
this
point
answered
that
question
very
simply.
in
its
view,
there
could
coexist
a
remedy
for
unfair
labor
practices
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
a
common
law
cause
of
action
sounding
in
conspiracy
under
state
law.
now
i
gather
that
at
this
point
that
opinion
--
that
view
has
been
abandoned
by
the
respondent.
at
least
it's
not
argued
at
all
because
since
the
first
opinion
under
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
there
have
been
some
other
decisions
in
this
court,
and
though
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
refused
the
third
time
around
to
hear
this
case,
it
denied
review
and
dismissed
an
appeal
on
the
ground
that
the
federal
question,
the
constitutional
question
was
without
substance.
in
fact,
this
court
has
decided
the
garmon
case,
and
the
garmon
case
pretty
clearly
demonstrates
that
it
is
not
true
that
a
cause
of
action
for
damages,
unlike
a
cause
of
action
for
an
injunction
can
coexist
with
respect
to
what
are
or
arguably
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
this
is
garmon
second.
mr.
david
e.
feller
garmon
second?
yes,
garmon
second
was
tort.
it
was
under
a
tort
law
assimilated
by
the
state
of
california
to
the
federal
law.
if
that‘s
the
case
that
matter
was
sent
back,
there
really
was
no
law
but
it
was
tort
and
it
was
damages.
and
garmon
established
that
the
fact
that
it
was
damages
didn't
make
any
difference.
up
to
that
point,
there
were
those
who
believe
since
that
we
had
russell
which
relied
on
the
fact
there
was
violence.
we
had
gonzales
which
relied
on
the
fact
it
was
a
suit
on
--
in
contract
to
restore
membership
rights
but
both
were
suits
for
damages,
as
has
been
the
labernum
which
is
a
violent
case.
and
there
were
those
including
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
read
that
law
as
to
say
that
the
distinction
was
damages
versus
injunction
and
this
court
decided
in
garmon
it
was
not
that.
and
so
the
supreme
court
of
ohio's
theory,
as
i
said,
has
been
abandoned
here.
the
respondent
in
his
brief
doesn't
rely
on
it
at
all.
instead,
he
has
--
made
several
other
arguments
which
i
can
briefly
summarize
as
far
as
i
can.
the
first
argument
is
that
the
plaintiff
respondent
was
a
supervisor
and
supervisors
are
outside
of
the
act.
therefore,
there
is
no
preemption.
that
argument
is
erroneous
to
the
matter
of
fact
and
as
of
law.
perhaps,
when
we
go
over
to
the
marks,
i'll
spend
a
few
minutes
on
that
question.
the
second
argument
is
that
the
relationship
of
union
to
member
is
at
the
periphery
of
the
act,
like
those
of
the
language
that's
used
and
therefore,
gonzales
applies.
now
let
me
deal
with
the
second
one
first
because
it's
very
quick.
in
gonzales,
this
court
held
that
a
member
who
sued
his
union
for
breach
of
contract,
the
contract
being
the
constitution
and
claiming
a
right
to
be
restored
to
membership
could
sue
in
the
state
court,
that
wasn't
disputed,
and
could
also
recover
consequential
damages
in
loss
of
employment
in
order
this
court
said
so
as
not
to
truncate
the
remedy.
the
essential
cause
of
action
as
the
court
in
gonzales
repeated
again
and
again,
the
critical
point
in
that
case
was
that
the
suit
was
a
suit
for
loss
of
rights
as
a
membership
in
the
union.
i
think
the
crux
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
said,
the
crux
of
the
claim
sustained
by
the
california
court
was
that
the
california
law
membership
in
the
labor
union
constitutes
a
contract
between
the
member
and
the
union.
the
dissent
in
that
case
argued
of
course
that
allowing
damages
for
a
loss
of
employment
rights
which
was
concededly
in
the
federal
area,
but
letting
it
latch
on
to
this
contract
action
put
a
premium
on
artful
pleading.
now
we
don't
have
to
worry
in
this
case
whether
gonzales
is
good
law
or
not
because
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
has
expressly
thrown
out
any
reliance
on
gonzales
in
this
case.
when
in
disposing
of
the
exhaustion
remedy,
it
said
this
case
is
not
a
case
in
which
suit
is
brought
for
loss
of
membership
rights
as
a
contract
suit,
but
is
a
suit
for
damages
for
loss
of
employment
rights.
but
of
course,
employment
rights
and
union
action
dealing
with
the
employment
rights,
this
is
the
very
crux
of
the
regulation
of
the
act,
a
good
part
of
the
regulation
of
the
act
in
regulating
union.
mr.
david
e.
feller
oh
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
“plaintiff
is
not
attempting
to
secure
any
redress
for
loss
of
rights
as
a
member
of
the
union.”
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
then
i
was
--
i
was
going
on
to
my
argument
that
employment
rights
are
what
at
the
crux
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
regulation
of
union
activity
section
8
(a)
(3)
which
your
honors
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
no.
well
i
think
that
--
i
think
what
it
says
is
that
seeking
a
monetary
award,
defendants
contend
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
he
said
it's
a
tort.
he
said
there
--
they
committed
a
common
law
tort
against
him
by
conspiring
to
deprive
him
of
his
right
to
earn
a
living
and
interfering
with
his
contract
of
employment
with
of
the
--
of
william
b.
pollock
company
for
which
he
has
money
judgments.
i
think
that's
interfering
with
his
employment
with
the
pollock
company.
now
as
i
said
interference
with
employment
for
not
being
a
union
member
or
for
other
reasons
is
at
the
essence
of
the
act's
regulations
of
union
conduct
in
section
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
act,
as
employer
section
8
(b)
(2)
of
the
act
and
as
i
think
we
can
get
on
the
later
section
8
(b)
(1)
of
the
act
also.
so
that
gonzales
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
we
are
in
the
essence
of
the
regulation.
the
only
question
left
i
think
for
me
to
discuss
is
the
question
as
to
whether
this
is
out
of
the
preempted
area
because
of
the
claim
that
plaintiff
is
just
a
superintendent
and
superintendents
somehow
are
exempted
from
the
entire
scope
of
the
act.
mr.
david
e.
feller
thank
you,
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
argument
yesterday,
i
think
we
had
left
only
one
point
uncovered.
that
is
the
respondent’s
argument
not
referred
to
in
the
courts
below
but
presumably
made
there
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
doesn’t
apply
to
the
area
involved
in
this
case
because
the
plaintiff
is
a
supervisor.
i
would
like
to
be
brief
and
i
think
to
brief
this
way
of
disposing
that
argument
is
to
point
out
that
it's
flatly
contradicted
by
the
record.
it
appears
that
a
superintendent
is
a
supervisor,
i
say
it
appears,
although
that
question
has
not
been
decided,
but
the
plaintiff
sued
not
only
for
a
loss
of
employment
as
a
superintendent,
but
for
the
union’s
action
in
preventing
him
from
obtaining
employment
as
a
foreman,
and
a
foreman
on
this
record
or
a
pusher
is
at
least
arguably
and
we
think
demonstrably
an
employee.
he's
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining
unit,
he's
covered
by
the
agreement,
he
is
required
to
be
a
member
of
the
union,
he
works
with
the
men,
he
has
--
bears
none
of
the
indicia,
normal
indicia
of
a
supervisor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
in
all
that,
if
your
honor
please,
i'll
move
right
on
to
that.
despite
the
fact
that
it's
clear
that
the
jury
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
everybody
consider
this
as
a
suit
for
loss
of
employment
as
a
foreman
as
well
as
a
superintendent.
it
is
also
clear
that
were
this
not
so
and
to
had
this
suit
only
for
a
loss
of
employment
as
a
superintendent,
we
think
it
is
clear
that
this
is
also
in
the
area
which
congress
has
regulated
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
on
the
approach
that
supervisors
are
not
excluded
from
the
act.
they
are
excluded
from
the
definition
of
employee
for
a
specific
reason.
congress
decided
and
senator
taft
--
this
is
senator
taft's
view
really
that
supervisors
are
to
be
identified
with
management.
they're
a
part
of
management.
the
employer
can
fire
him
or
hire
him
without
regard
to
union
activity
or
anti-union
activity
and
they're
to
be
identified
with
that.
now
that
doesn't
mean
that
congress
hasn't
made
a
decision
about
supervisors
or
regulated
supervisors,
but
what
it
means
is
the
congress
has
said
they
are
not
to
be
given
employee
protection
against
employer
action
and
indeed
following
that
theory
they
went
further.
they
said
they
are
to
be
giving
protection
against
union
action
because
they
are
members
of
management.
and
in
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
of
the
act
they
made
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
restrain
or
coerce
an
employer
in
the
selection
of
his
representatives
for
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining
or
the
adjustment
of
grievances.
and
as
we
quote
senator
taft
in
our
brief,
he
said,
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
say
is
to
prevent
a
union,
and
i
quote
here
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
to
prevent
a
union
from
quote,
saying
to
the
employer,
“you
have
to
fire
foreman
jones,
we
do
not
like
foreman
jones
and
therefore
you
have
to
fire
him
or
we
will
not
go
to
work.”
that
was
the
purpose
of
8
(b)
(1)
(b).
now,
in
other
words,
congress
regulated
the
whole
area
of
union
action
affecting
the
employment
rights
of
both
employees
and
supervisors,
but
it
regulated
them
differently.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
we
think
gonzales
has
no
bearing
because
we
think
that
gonzales
is
a
case,
your
honor,
which
rested
on
the
proposition
as
it
was
stated
in
the
opinion.
that
it
was
a
suit
concededly
within
state
court
jurisdiction
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
to
redress
the
contractual
right
of
a
member
to
remain
a
member
of
the
union.
damages
or
loss
of
employment
rights
were
admitted
to
be
within
the
power
of
the
state
in
that
case
because
the
court
did
not
want
to
separate
a
unitary
remedy.
it
seemed
to
be
conceded
in
gonzales
that
a
suit
based
on
union
action
to
deprive
the
member
of
his
employment
would
be
preempted
that
a
suit
to
deprive
him
of
his
rights
as
a
member
of
the
union,
and
indeed
section
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
act,
which
your
honors
had
an
opportunity
to
consider
this
last
week,
intended
to
separate
the
whole
act,
membership
rights
from
employment
rights.
and
what
the
court
said
as
we
have
one
thing
which
is
exclusively
federal,
one
thing
--
area
in
which
the
state
can
act
and
they
said
as
a
kind
of
pendent
jurisdiction
we
will
allow
the
state
to
give
the
remedy
in
the
federal
area
because
it
is
part
of
a
lawsuit
which
the
state
clearly
has
jurisdiction
of.
and
in
the
first
appeal
in
this
case,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
took
out
the
state
area
of
action
here.
so
we
have
--
the
best
argument
is
we
have
pendent
jurisdiction
with
nothing
to
pend
to.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
there
are
those
including
the
afl-cio
who
argued
that
that
is
what
it
comes
down
to
and
therefore
gonzales
is
wrong.
we're
not
compelled
to
come
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
david
e.
feller
no,
your
honor.
i
--
you
asked
my
opinion,
i
think
the
case
is
wrong,
but
i'm
not
compelled
to
argue
it
here
and
i
don't
want
to
use
the
little
time
i
have
to
argue
a
question
that's
not
necessary
to
the
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
think
that
it
is
at
least
arguable,
(a)
that
if
he
is
a
supervisor,
it
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
the
union
to
do
what
it
did
here,
and
for
the
one
reason
i
gave
and
for
another
reason
there
are
cases
cited
in
our
brief
in
which
the
board
has
held
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
fire
a
supervisor
because
the
effect
of
that
firing
under
those
circumstances
will
have
to
encourage
or
discourage
employees
in
membership
of
the
union.
i
don't
want
to
go
in
that
detail.
that's
the
second
reason
why
it
was
arguably
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
the
third
string,
if
i
may
barrow
from
mr.
warren
yesterday,
the
third
string
is
that
even
if
there
were
no
argument
as
to
whether
if
he
were
a
supervisor
there'd
be
an
unfair
labor
practice,
it
is
at
least
arguable
whether
he
is
a
supervisor
here
and
relies
underneath
the
case.
and
that
i
think
three
strings,
three
arrows
are
enough
to
dispose
of
that
argument.
and
so
i
like
to
conclude
and
save
a
minute
or
two
for
rebuttal
if
i
may?
mr.
david
e.
feller
we
find
that
just
a
concluding
word
that
this
case
involves
an
area
of
activity,
union
activity
dealing
with
employment,
not
membership
which
congress
has
regulated,
and
having
regulated
we
do
not
think
that
the
states
are
free
to
judge
whether
the
conduct
is
proper
or
improper
and
assess
damages
on
a
common
law
conspiracy
doctrine.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
the
two
answers
to
that
question,
the
board
has
held
that
under
the
circumstances
in
which
it
finds
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
discharging
the
foreman
and
we
cite
the
cases
on
page
3
of
our
reply
brief,
they
can
order
the
foreman
reinstated
with
back
pay.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
correct.
now
those
are
not
exactly
these
case
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
assume
that
if
a
charge
was
filed
under
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
and
these
cases
which
i've
cited
are
not
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
cases.
they
are
8
(a)
(1)
cases
in
which
an
employer
was
found
guilty
of
coercing
his
employees
by
discharging
a
supervisor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
in
those
cases
i
assume
--
i
don't
know
who
filed
the
charge.
it
doesn't
matter,
anybody
can
file
a
charge
with
the
labor
board
and
the
labor
board
then
gives
relief
to
those
they
find
have
been
injured
by
the
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that
he
could
file
a
charge
jointly
against
the
employer
and
the
union
or
against
the
union
or
against
the
employer
if
he
so
desire.
mr.
david
e.
feller
but
i
don't
think
it
even
makes
a
difference
whether
he
could
or
not.
in
other
words,
i
say
first
that
he
could
and
he
could
get
back
pay
and
second
of
all
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
if
he
couldn't.
mr.
david
e.
feller
because
i
think
this
court
said
in
garmon,
relying
on
guss
where
it
was
perfectly
clear
nobody
could
file
a
charge.
indeed,
that's
where
the
problem
arose
in
guss
because
the
board
refused
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
what
this
court
said
if
this
is
an
area
which
congress
has
regulated
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
congress
gave
the
board
the
power
to
regulate
in
this
area.
and
indeed,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
garmon
case
had
to
explain
the
ways
of
some
language
in
labernum
and
said
that
we
recognize
that
in
labernum
that
opinion
found
support
in
the
fact
that
the
state
remedy
had
no
federal
counterpart,
that's
what
we're
asking
here.
does
the
state
remedy
have
a
federal
counterpart
and
he
explains
that
that
wasn't
really
the
basis
of
the
decision.
the
decision
was
determined
on
the
basis
of
violence
as
an
exception
to
the
normal
preemption
rules.
in
other
words,
you
cannot
find
an
exact
concordance
of
remedies.
the
question
is
has
congress
decided
to
regulate
this
kind
of
activity
in
this
area
and
if
it
has,
if
congress
has
provided
a
remedy
that's
well
and
good.
and
congress
may
have
not
provided
a
remedy
but
you
cannot
interstitially
stick
in
state
court
jurisdiction
on
a
completely
different
theory
because
in
a
particular
case
you
find
no
remedy.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right.
and
our
position
also
is
that
he
has
a
remedy,
it's
a
superfluous
argument.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
think
it's
true
that
a
supervisor
fired
because
he's
a
member
of
a
union
would
take
that
simple
case,
congress
decided
that
employers
could
fire
supervisors
because
they
were
members
of
the
union
and
i
think
that's
the
answer
to
it,
if
i
may
just
take
one
more
minute
-
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
no,
the
board
could
not
do
that
for
him.
that
was
gonzales
and
i
think
that
in
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor,
i
think
i
have
to
correct
the
record
or
at
least
correct
the
argument,
in
this
case
of
mr.
goldberg
has
apparently
put
it
back
in
the
case.
i
direct
your
honors
attention
to
page
168
of
the
record
which
he
said,
“members
of
the
jury,
i
charge
you
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
trial
of
jacob
perko
by
the
executive
order
of
the
defendant
union
was
an
exercise
of
the
lawful
right
of
the
executive
order
of
the
defendant
union”.
the
findings
and
penalty
of
the
local
union
as
modified
by
the
--
cannot
be
questioned
to
this
court
in
this
proceeding.
so
he
cannot
justify
the
judgment
he
got
on
the
basis
that
he's
trying
to
rectify
the
union
proceeding
against
perko
because
that
is
out
of
the
case
by
instruction
of
the
trial
court.
thank
you.
