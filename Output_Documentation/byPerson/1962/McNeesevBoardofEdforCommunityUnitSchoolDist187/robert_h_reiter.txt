mr.
robert
h.
reiter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
fact
is
this
is
a
test
case.
the
big
problem
out
in
illinois
is
in
chicago
where
there
are
a
number
of
suits
pending
which
have
resulted
in
the
same
disposition,
at
least
one
of
them
has,
as
in
this
case.
so
that,
i
think
perhaps
it's
fair
to
say
that
everybody
has
been
holding
up
waiting
to
see
what
this
court
is
going
to
do
on
this
question
of
the
required
attempt
to
resort
to
the
state
procedure.
referring
to
mr.
justice
goldberg's
inquiry
about
illinois,
there
is
now
a
very
serious
problem
pending
in
chicago
where
there
have
been
nine
applications
made
to
the
state
superintendent
of
public
instruction.
he,
thereupon,
appointed
a
hearing
examiner.
the
hearing
examiner
has
taken
the
testimony
on
both
sides,
and
now,
has
the
matter
under
submission.
the
big
problem
of
course
in
chicago,
as
in
new
york
in
most
of
the
--
in
many
of
the
large
areas
of
population
in
the
east,
is
what
is
known
as
de
facto
segregation
which
this
court,
at
some
time
or
other,
is
perhaps
going
to
have
to
consider.
and,
namely,
he's
a
local
authority
under
an
affirmative
duty
to
integrate
in
a
community
where
you
have
pockets
of
negro
and
white
population
adjoining
one
another.
this
is
going
to
be
a
very
serious
problem.
mr.
robert
h.
reiter
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
reiter
yes,
and
we
have
the
same
problem
in
this
case,
too,
and
i
think,
probably,
that
judge
juergens
had
this
in
mind
when
he
decided
and
which
is
all
that
he
decided,
as
found
on
page
22
of
the
record,
that
“look,
fellows,
before
you
come
into
the
federal
court
and
ask
me
to
go
into
this
whole
problem
of
boundaries,
transportation,
questions
of
economics,
the
question
of
building
new
schools,
and
so
forth,
at
least
shouldn't
you
give
the
state
a
chance?
i'm
not
saying,
in
other
words,
that
you
have
to
exhaust
any
administrative
remedy.
all
i'm
saying
is
you
haven't
shown
that
you
e
--
you
have
even
tried
to
ask
the
state
to
do
anything.
at
least
give
the
state
which
has,
in
the
past,
given
no
indication
of
either
a
propensity
or
of
affirmative
action
on
their
part
to
deny
the
rights
of
negroes.
give
them
a
chance
and
then
come
back
to
me
later
on.”
i
think
this
is
not
exactly
a
monroe
versus
pape
situation
to
revert
to
the
question
after
my
colleague
by
mr.
justice
douglas.
monroe
versus
pape
considered
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
you
were
required
to
resort
to
the
state
remedy
and
there
was
no
federal
remedy
in
a
situa
--
under
the
civil
rights
act
in
a
situation
where
what
you
were
complaining
about
is
not
a
violation
of
state
law.
and
the
court
in
that
case
it
held
that
it
was
very
definitely
decided
in
the
--
by
congress
in
enacting
the
civil
rights
act
that
even
where
the
state
law
would
declare
the
complaint
of
action
to
be
illegal,
still,
there
was
a
right
to
come
into
federal
court
under
the
civil
rights
act.
our
question
here
is
entirely
different.
our
question
here
basically
is
this,
where
a
federal
judge
feels
that
the
state
should
be
given
a
chance,
is
he
within
his
proper
exercise
of
judicial
discretion
in
saying,
“gentlemen
go
to
the
state
and
then
come
back
to
me”?
i
don't
think,
frankly,
that
judge
juergens
in
this
case
really
intended
to
say
“you
have
no
cause
of
action
because
you
didn't
go
to
the
state.”
i
think
what
he
really
intended
to
say
is,
“i'm
deferring
to
the
state.
take
a
crack
at
the
state
remedy
and
then
if
you're
turned
down,
either
because
of
the
fact
that
you
--
that
he
requires
50
signatures
and
doesn't
take
to
the
signature
of
one
person
or
due
to
the
fact
that
he
drags
the
page
out
for
years
so
that
your
remedy
will
be
ineffectual
or
that
he
defers
it
to
a
state
judicial
proceeding,
then,
please,
come
back
here.”
mr.
robert
h.
reiter
well,
he
had
a
choice.
i
suppose,
if
i
had
been
in
his
shoes
and
had
decided
to
do
what
he
thought
was
proper
practice,
i
think
i
would
probably
retain
jurisdiction
which
was
what
has
been
done
in
many
of
the
district
cases
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief.
he
would
have
said,
“i'm
n
--
just
not
going
to
proceed
in
the
case.
i'm
going
to
hold
it
in
advance
then
you
go
to
the
state
and
come
back
here
after
that.”
he
chose
the,
let's
say,
the
more
serious
and
the
--
what
i
consider
would
probably
be
the
less
desirable
technique
of
simply
dismissing
it
and
say
“start
your
suit
over
again.”
but,
i
think
in
his
opinion,
and
he
fortunately
wrote
quite
a
nice
memorandum
opinion,
he
did
indicate
why
he
did
it.
he
wanted
them
to
just
try,
and
this
is
in
accordance
with
the
longstanding
proce
--
practice.
we
have
a
lot
of
--
a
long
line
of
decisional
law.
for
example,
the
famous
case
of
prentis
versus
the
atlantic
coast
line
railroad
at
211
u.s.
210
which
says
that,
ordinarily,
where
there
is
a
state
administrative
procedure,
the
federal
courts
will
give
way
to
the
state
procedure
and
require
the
exhaustion
of
the
remedies.
now,
if
this
is
found
to
be
simply
a
judicial
procedure,
mr.
chief
justice,
then
i
would
agree
with
you,
then,
it
doesn't
apply.
this
has
been
utilized
only
where
it
is
a
state
administrative
procedure.
and,
our
answer
to
that
is
simply
that
where
you
have
a
state
which
has
been
known
for
years
and
years
to
have
followed
the
rule
against
segregation,
against
discrimination,
where
you
have
no
showing
whatever
that
the
state
superintendent
of
public
education
won't
be
in
--
won't
inquire
properly
and
will
not
administratively
grant
the
relief
which
he
has
in
his
control,
namely
the
power
of
the
purse,
where
he
won't
do
it,
then
you
have
a
state
administrative
relief
possible.
he
isn't
required
to
go
into
court.
that,
in
other
words,
is
the
--
perhaps
the
ultimate
remedy
available
to
him
if
the
local
community
says,
“well,
we're
going
to
operate
without
any
state
funds,”
and
it's
rather
unlikely
that
the
--
that
any
state
locality
is
going
to
operate
without
25%
of
its
budget
being
raised
in
the
form
of
state
funds.
this
court,
in
other
words,
in
monroe
versus
pape
had
simply
the
question
of
jurisdiction
before
it
and
it
held
that
there
--
that
they
are
coequal
remedy,
the
state
remedy
and
the
federal
remedy
under
the
civil
rights
act.
but
today,
we
have
a
different
problem.
we've
got
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
federal
courts
may
defer
to
the
state
administrative
remedy.
and
i
would
not
try
to
reargue
monroe
versus
pape.
i'm
pleased
that
we
have
such
a
group
of
opinions
in
that
case
which
give
a
pretty
good
outline
of
the
problems
created.
i
would
simply
suggest
perhaps
that
the
court
reconsider
the
points
raised
by
the
late
justice
frankfurter
in
his
dissent.
those
points
are
--
may
i
just
take
a
moment
to
review.
first
of
all,
shouldn't
there
be
a
proper
distinction
created
or
isn't
it
possible
that
a
distinction
should
be
created
in
a
mind
of
a
federal
judge
exercising
his
discretion
as
to
where
in
cases
that
exist,
and
this
court
is
fully
familiar
with
them,
in
the
south
where
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
state
authorities
and
the
state
legislature
certainly
does
not
intend
that
the
--
that
relief
be
given
and
where
the
state
law
actually
sanctions,
in
many
cases,
the
discriminatory
actions
complained
of.
and,
on
the
other
hand,
a
state
such
as
illinois,
where
this
certainly
is
not
the
case,
where
the
state
authorities
are
bound
by
their
oaths
to
uphold
not
only
the
federal
constitution
but
the
constitution
and
the
laws
of
the
state
of
illinois
which
have,
for
years,
said
that
discrimination
is
illegal.
secondly,
it
has
been
suggested
by
mr.
harth
that
there
are
263
cases
pending
in
the
south
covering
this
type
of
problem.
there
are
many
cases
pending
in
the
north.
however,
i
have
been
able
to
calculate
the
number.
they
just
aren't
listed
anywhere.
it
is
a
principle
of
judicial
administration
that
the
effectiveness,
particularly
of
a
judicial
remedy
in
the
federal
courts,
is
inversely
proportional
with
the
frequency
of
its
exercise.
it
seems
to
me
that
justice
frankfurter,
in
mentioning
that,
had
in
mind
that,
if
possible,
the
federal
courts
should,
particularly
in
the
field
of
public
schools,
keep
their
intervention
to
a
minimum.
this
court
recognized
in
the
brown
case,
and
has
recognized
in
other
cases
since
then,
that
the
problems
existing
in
the
public
school
sys
--
public
school
cases
are
much
more
difficult
probably
than
any
other
area
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
because,
here,
you
simply
do
not
have
the
problem
relating,
“yes,
admit
this
man
to
a
college”
or
the
case
that
came
up
last
week,
“yes,
let
these
people
enter
the
public
parks.”
here,
you
have
a
problem
of
drawing
new
districts
--
new
school
districts,
and
the
problems
are
fantastic.
and,
i
believe
that
not
only
justice
frankfurter,
but
judge
juergens
recognized
the
seriousness
of
these
problems.
third,
public
school
education
is
basically
a
question
for
determination
by
the
state
authority.
they
had
--
this
is
clearly
a
state
function
and
i
feel
that
justice
frankfurter,
in
suggesting
that,
had
in
mind
that
if
it
were
at
all
possible,
if
there
appear
to
be
any
likelihood
that
relief
would
be
obtained
in
the
state,
that
likelihood
should
be
exhausted.
and
here,
there's
no
indication
in
the
record
whatever
that
it
would
not
be
done.
of
course,
i
would
add
another
point
to
those
mentioned
by
justice
frankfurter,
namely
that
as
we
see
it
--
mr.
robert
h.
reiter
they
assert
that
discrimination
does
exist.
mr.
robert
h.
reiter
yes,
but
someone
has
to
determine
whether
in
fact
they
do
exist.
mr.
robert
h.
reiter
that
--
mr.
chief
justice,
you
misunderstood
me.
i
intended
to
say
that
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record
of
any
inclination
on
the
part
of
the
state
authorities
against
granting
relief
in
a
case
where
a
proper
case
of
discrimination
is
made
out.
that
is
what
i
intended
to
say.
mr.
robert
h.
reiter
unfortunately,
we
have
an
extremely
poor
record
here,
and
as
a
matter,
if
we
had
understood
conceivably
that
we're
coming
to
the
supreme
court,
we
might
have
done
it
differently.
on
the
other
hand,
we
perhaps
would
never
have
had
a
record
establishing
that
there
had
been
any
attempt
made
by
the
petitioners
here
to
make
application
to
the
state
authorities.
and,
i
believe
it
was,
as
i
understand
it,
the
intention
of
the
school
board
here
to
see
that
such
application
was
made,
so
that
at
least
the
state
authorities
had
an
opportunity
to
consider
whether
they
were
going
to
go
into
the
case.
that
was
the
--
that's
the
only
way
we
could
get
a
proper
record
in
this
case,
if
they
had
actually
applied
to
the
superintendent
of
public
instructions.
mr.
robert
h.
reiter
well,
the
structure
in
which
the
case
comes
before
this
court
is
the
complaint.
and
the
court
has
to
simply
consider
it
based
upon
the
complaint
which
says
there
is
discrimination,
and
as
a
matter
--
you're
correct,
your
honor,
in
indicating
that
it
might
have
been
better
if
this
whole
thing
had
been
all
the
way
through
the
federal
district
court
and
he
had
made
his
findings
and
so
forth
but,
at
that
point,
unfortunately,
the
issue
of
whether
they
had
gone
--
should
have
gone
to
the
state
authorities
would
have
been
aviated
because,
then,
federal
judge
would've
gone
to
all
the
trouble
of
going
into
it
and
perhaps
establishing
a
decree.
it
would
then
be
too
late
probably
for
us
to
go
in
to
raise
this
issue
which
is
before
the
court
today.
mr.
robert
h.
reiter
i
agree,
absolutely.
mr.
robert
h.
reiter
well
--
mr.
robert
h.
reiter
we
then
--
mr.
robert
h.
reiter
he
filed
the
motion,
not
thinking
that
it
would
come
up
on
that
basis.
we
thought
they
would
try
to
go
to
the
statement
and
be
turned
down
if
they
were
going
to
be
turned
down.
it
is
unfortunate
that
this
case
comes
on
this
poor
record
and,
actually,
it
would've
been
much
better.
mr.
robert
h.
reiter
mr.
boman
has
indicated
that
he
has
the
answer
to
this
and
since
he
was
on
the
spot,
may
i
defer
to
him
on
this
matter?
mr.
robert
h.
reiter
let
me
say,
in
connection
with
what
mr.
justice
harlan
said,
that
this
court
itself
in
cooper
versus
aaron
said
this,
“every
state
legislator
and
executive
and
judicial
officer
is
solemnly
committed
by
oath
taken
pursuant
to
article
6
paragraph
3
to
support
the
constitution.
no
state
legislator
or
executive
or
judicial
officer
can
war
against
the
constitution
without
violating
his
undertaking
to
support
it.”
in
other
words,
the
state
superintendent
of
public
instruction
has
a
responsibility
here,
in
the
same
manner
as
the
federal
agencies
who
hand
out
funds
to
the
states
under
the
national
defense
education
act
and
the
other
acts
providing
for
federal
assistance
require
that
there
not
be
discrimination
in
the
areas
where
they
do
give
such
money.
there
is
no
reason
why
the
state
superintendent
of
education
should
not
follow
the
same
rule
and
will
not
follow
the
same
rule
in
carrying
out
his
duties.
now,
here
are
the
things
which
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
conclusion
which
we
do
not
want
and
which
we
do
want.
we
would
not
be
pleased
with
a
decision
which
said
that,
in
all
cases,
a
federal
court
must
defer
to
a
state
court.
this
could
be
used,
we
feel,
by
jurisdiction
which
really
had
in
mind
delaying,
if
not
completely
eliminating,
any
possibility
of
segregation
being
excluded.
nor,
would
we
be
pleased
with
the
decision
that
the
discretion
of
the
federal
courts
in
this
matter
is
absolute.
on
the
other
hand,
we
do
feel
that
where
there
is
no
showing
of
the
predisposition
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
frustrate
adheres
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
state
authorities
who
are
principally
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
educational
system
of
the
state
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
work
them
out.
as
pointed
out
last
week
in
connection
with
the
memphis
case,
this
is
the
serious
--
this
is
the
most
serious
area
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
is
the
area
where
there
are
a
number
of
fiscal,
economic,
transportation,
and
social
problems
involved
in
any
determination
that's
made.
and,
in
this
type
of
determination,
we
feel
that
the
state,
where
the
--
where,
in
our
view
incidentally,
the
board
of
education
not
only
of
the
state
and
the
--
but
the
board
of
education
of
the
locality
which
are
not
involved
in
--
under
the
civil
rights
act,
we
say,
could
be
brought
into
this
situation
where
they
could
sit
down
and
be
asked
to
work
these
things
out,
a
judicial
procedure
is
simply
not
the
proper
kind
of
a
procedure
for
the
determination
of
such
thing.
it
can
be
done,
no
question
about
it.
judge
kaufman
did
it
in
new
rochelle.
i
guess
it
could
be
done
again,
but
it's
a
tremendous
undertaking
to
try
to
do
it,
and
judge
kaufman
indicated
he
had
a
terrible
time
but
he
tried
to
be
mediator
for
a
while.
so,
i
say,
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
--
mr.
robert
h.
reiter
well,
not
very
much,
as
i
understand,
in
the
area
of
redistricting
whole
communities.
they're
going
to
be
asked
to
do
it
from
now
on.
there
are
number
of
cases
pending
on
long
island,
in
new
york
city,
in
chicago.
mr.
robert
h.
reiter
well,
i
think,
however,
voting
is
a
little
bit
clearer
than
schools.
voting,
you
--
i
think
you
can
perhaps
handle
on
a
somewhat
more
of
a
geographical
basis
than
you
can
children.
mr.
robert
h.
reiter
that
is
--
that's
a
--
voting
--
this
is,
at
least,
a
serious
problem
as
baker
versus
carr,
and
i'd
say
more
serious.
and,
therefore,
i
think
the
court
owes
a
responsibility,
if
it
feels
as
though
there
is
a
possibility
of
state
relief,
to
permit
the
state
at
least
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
it
can
do
the
job.
thank
you.
