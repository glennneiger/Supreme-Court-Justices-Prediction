justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
what
i
thought
because
illinois
goes
much
further
south.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
was
called
--
justice
potter
stewart
little
egypt
or
whatever
it's
called.
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
is
not
in
that
area?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
in
the
st.
louis
area.
justice
potter
stewart
what
we
have
--
what
you're
telling
us,
mr.
harth,
is
disclosing
this
case,
if
it
all,
only
by
the
pleadings,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
is
this
an
exhaustion
case,
or
is
it
--
well,
the
claim
made
simply
that
you
didn't
even
--
even
--
to
even
attempt
to
invoke
the
state
remedies?
justice
potter
stewart
exhausted
or
invoked?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
opinion
speaks
for
itself.
i
don't
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
want
to
be
--
get
clear
in
my
own
mind
what
the
issue
is
here.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
it's
an
exhaustion
issue
or
a
failure
to
try.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
you
go.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
we
did
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
complaint
specifically
alleges
that
the
plaintiffs
have
not
exhausted
it
because
the
administrative
remedy
is
inadequate.
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
the
state
procedure
enacted?
justice
potter
stewart
the
illinois,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
has
prohibited
racial
segregation
in
its
school
systems
since,
what,
1901,
hasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
procedure
is
relatively
new.
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
anything
--
did
it
have
a
predecessor?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
a
provision,
isn't
there,
that
the
superintendent
can
proceed
on
his
own
motion?
justice
potter
stewart
where
does
that
appear
in
the
brief
or
isn't
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
wouldn't
it
at
least
be
presumed
that
if
any
one
individual
wrote
to
him
and
set
out
the
--
told
him
about
a
pattern
of
racial
segregation
in
a
particular
school
district,
that
that
would
give
him
a
sufficient
basis
to
have
reason
to
believe,
as
the
statute
says,
that
such
discrimination
may
exist.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
authorize
him
in
his
discretion,
as
it
says
“may,”
to
proceed.
justice
potter
stewart
to
proceed.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
again,
this
is
just
a
request.
he
can't--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
my
question
as
to
this
part
of
the
statute
was
really
directed
to
your
point
that
it
requires
50
people
to
initiate
one
of
these
proceedings.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
thought
that
maybe
one
person
writing
to
the
superintendent
and
setting
out
a
situation
in
a
particular
school
district
would
then
permit
the
superintendent
to
proceed.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
that
would
be
--
even,
even
though
50
people
get
together
and
make
a
complaint,
still,
they'd
abs
--
the
element
of
compulsion
is
absent,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
you
still
have
the
lack
of
compulsion
after
he's
comple
--
finished
on
the
attorney
general?
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
point
is
that
for
only
an
individual
and
the
superintendent
declined
in
his
discretion
to
act
after
being
told
about
the
situation
by
an
individual,
that
as
to
that
individual,
the
state
remedy
would
be
clearly
inadequate
and
he
would
then
be
clear
to
go
into
federal
court.
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
is
reminiscent
of
the
argument
of
the
losing
party
in
baker
versus
carr.
