justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
the
same
one
that
was
involved
in
monroe?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
what
we
said
in
that
case,
but
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
about
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
language
there
is
“shall.”
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
person.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
doesn't
make
--
that
doesn't
bear
upon
the
--
whether
or
not
cause
of
action?
justice
william
o.
douglas
have
you
any
authority
of
any
precedence
in
the
resort
to
a
state
remedy
before
you
resort
to
your
federal
remedy,
or
you
have
two
remedies,
one
under
state
law
and
one
under
federal
law?
that
seems
to
be
at
war
with
the
whole
conception
of
the
federal
system
because,
as
you
know,
there
was
in
the
very
beginning
of
this
country,
an
effort
made
to
enforce
federal
rights
in
state
courts,
and
the
first
congress
created
the
federal
court
system.
justice
william
o.
douglas
for
the
enforcement
of
federal
rights,
and
i
just
wonder
where
you
get
this
or
where
the
court
below
got
this
idea
that
a
federal
right
couldn't
be
enforced
until
a
state
right,
if
there
was
one,
had
first
to
be
enforced
or
sought
to
be
enforced.
justice
william
o.
douglas
they
must
be
so
differing
as
to
be
not
recognizable
as
such.
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh,
yes,
over
and
over
again,
but
suppose
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
but
we're
dealing
with
a
dual
system
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
rights
under
a
state
system
and
rights
under
a
federal
system.
i
never
realized
that
federal
rights
were
dependent
on,
first,
going
--
exhausting
a
state
remedy
unless,
of
course,
that
was
provided
in
the
creation
of
a
federal
right.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
then,
what
we
said
monroe
v.
pape
is
not
in
line
with
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
but
there
were
defendants
rep
--
who
were
performing
municipal
function.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
on
the
basis
that
this
is
just
legal
strategy,
we
can't
take
it
at
face
value
to
what
mr.
reiter
says
because,
certainly,
a
federal
district
court
is
a
place
where
issues
can
to
be
tried
out.
