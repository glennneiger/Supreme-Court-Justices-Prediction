did
you,
in
fact
--
perhaps
it's
shown
in
the
record,
if
not,
i
don't
know.
did
you,
in
fact,
make
any
effort
to
proceed
to
the
state?
justice
tom
c.
clark
we
didn't
need
that
record
to
contest
what
we
have
been
told
here
today
that,
in
fact,
in
east
st.
louis,
schools
have
been
desegregated.
the
problem
that
you
are
now
dealing
with
drawing
boundaries
and
we're
not
dealing
actually
with
a
question
of
basic
segregation
of
school
structures.
we
don't
have
that
here.
the
case
that
you
are
stating
to
us
orally,
we
don't
have
before
us.
we
have
a
case
which
deals
with
a
complaint
and
says
that
the
school
authority
is
deliberately
proceeding
upon
a
plan
to
maintain
and
create
new
segregation
in
the
school
system
and
we
have,
of
all
the
certs
here,
legal
defense
that
assuming
that
it's
true,
that
everything
you
say
is
true,
separate
entrances,
all
of
that,
that
the
remedy
for
you
is
to
make
a
complaint
before
the
school
superintendent
who
has
some
specific
and
then
some
general
powers
over
the
school
system,
isn't
that
the
structure
of
the
case
now
before
us?
justice
tom
c.
clark
not
necessarily
because
of
this,
that
the
question
of
what
relief
might
be
available
under
the
administrative
procedure
and
a
necessity
to
have
recourse
to
it
might
very
well
depend
upon
the
given
facts,
don't
you
agree?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
therefore,
how
do
you,
how
do
you
treat
it
in
isolation,
as
this
case
has
now
before
us?
justice
tom
c.
clark
of
course,
the
parties
made
their
choice,

clients
