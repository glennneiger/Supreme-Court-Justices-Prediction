mr.

chief
justice
earl

mr.
harth,
in
the
event
the
superintendent
has
a
hearing
on
one
of
these
complaints
under
these
administrative
procedures
and
he
finds
that
the
complaint
is
not
supported,
is
there
any
judicial
review
of
that
action
on
his
part?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
harth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
boman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
whites
and
how
many
blacks
are
there
in
the
city
in
that
school
district?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
just
one
person
abides
to
the
superintendent
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
would
not
have
a
hearing,
that
he
could
then
go
in
without
a
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
your
act
said
that
50
--
he
wouldn't
have
to
do
it
unless,
unless
50
people
signed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
would
it
be
any
easier
for
your
state
courts
to
do
that
job
judicially
than
for
the
federal
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
if
the
superintendent
decides
that
there
was
a
case
made
in
the
complaint
to
him,
then
he
would
ask
the
attorney
general
to
bring
an
action
in
your
state
courts,
and
then
your
state
courts
would
have
to
do
exactly
the
thing
that
you're
saying
the
federal
courts
cannot
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
but
your
procedure
provides
that
he
shall
take
it
to
the--
he
may
take
it
to
the
attorney
general,
and
the
attorney
general
will
file
a
suit
in
the
circuit
court
in
illinois.
and,
if
he
did
that,
wouldn't
he
be
in
precisely
the
same
situation
as
the
federal
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
nothing
could
compel
him
to
do
that
in
your
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
under
your
administrative
practice
act,
your
school
district,
after
he
made
his
ruling,
could,
itself,
take
it
into
the
courts
and
go
through
the
courts,
could
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
would
bring
me
back
to
justice
brennan's
question
of
view.
i
wonder
why
the
superintendent,
instead
of
going
through
a
long
proceeding
of
this
kind
through
the
district
courts,
through
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
through
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
wouldn't
hold
a
hearing
and
determine,
if
as
you
say
these
things
are
untrue,
determine
that
they
are
not
and
get
it
over
with.
why
would
he
wait
years
and
let
this
hang
fire
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
there
was
nothing
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
understand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
one
more
counsel
to
argue,
mr.
harth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
reiter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
don't
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
say
that
that
has
not
been
done,
that
there
is
this
discrimination
in
the
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well,
don't
we
have
to
accept
that
as
being
the
fact
for
the
purposes
of
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
but
you
say
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
nothing
on
the
record
to
show
this.
our
record
says
that
those
things
are
true,
so
far
as
the
case
is
concerned
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
harth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
harth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
gentlemen,
there's
one
matter
that
i'd
like
to
get
cleared
up.
as
i
understood
mr.
boman,
the
superintendent
of
public
instruction
was
required
to
withhold
funds
if
there
was
any
discretion
--
i
mean,
any
discrimination
in
these
local
schools
and
that
he
had
the
power
to
do
just
that.
i
understood
you
to
say
the
opposite
now.
am
i
right
that
those
two
statements
were
made?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it's
your
position
there's
nothing
in
the
law
that
gives
him
the
right
to
withhold
funds.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
mr.
boman,
is
there
any
difference
of
opinion
on
that,
i
--because
i
got
the
impression
that
there
was
direct
conflict
between
the
two
of
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
as
i
understood
mr.
harth,
it
isn't
put
within
his
power
to
determine
the
validity
of
those
affidavits,
that
if
the
affidavit
is
filed,
he
shall
certify.
isn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
is
it
your
contention,
under
illinois
law,
that
he
can
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
perhaps,
both
of
you
could
give
us
a
short
memorandum
on
that
as
to
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
your
understanding
of
the
law.
