they
had
assumed
the
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.

did
he
have
to
allege
that
he
tried
to
make
a
decision
but
was
unable
to
get
one?
justice
arthur
j.

does
he
have
to
show
a
reason
for
not
complying
with
this?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
in
your
opinion
would
be
a
good
excuse
to
not
comply?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
may
i
ask
a
question?
we
all
know
from
the
experience
that
there
is,
according
to
decisions
of
this
court,
that
it's
not
very
easy
to
get
parents
to
litigate
to
a
certain
community
as
in
here.
do
you
think
allegations
of
that
type
would
be
adequate
to
single
out
the
state's
problems
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
parents
in
this
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
community
who
see
fit
that
these
claimants
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
are
you
saying,
mr.
boman,
i
should
know
the
answer,
but
is
my
recollection
correct
that,
despite
the
fact
that
this
constitutional
provision
of
illinois
has
been
in
existence
all
that
period
of
time,
that
as
a
practical
matter,
there
was
a
very
substantial
amount
of
school
segregation
throughout
the
state
up
to
the
time
of
the
brown
decision,
and
perhaps
if
my
recollection
as
a
former
resident
of
chicago
law,
but
i
don't
exclude
chicago
from
it.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
the
school
district
that
was
involved.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
reiter,
(inaudible)
despite
the
question
in
the
plea
to
cease
and
desist.
then,
it
goes
on
and
says
that
your
clients
are
maintaining
they're
creating
racially
segregated
classrooms
and
separate
educational
facilities
and
go
on
and
deal
specifically
that
negro
--
no
negro
teachers
teach
any
white
students
in
this
school,
there's
the
negro
students
with
exceptionally
in
the
10
classrooms
located
in
the
other
in
one
part
of
the
school
building
separate
and
apart
from
the
white
students
who
are
perfectly
free
to
use
entrances
separate.
now,
counsel
says
when
he
got
up
and
made
his
final
argument,
“this
isn't
true
and
we
could
prove
that
it's
not
true,”
but
again,
we
have
it
in
the
complaint.
and,
perhaps
what
you're
saying
would
have
much
greater
validity.
if
an
answer
has
been
filed
raising
--
contesting
the
allegation,
then
concluding
as
one
of
the
defendants
that
there
is
no
pattern
of
general
segregation,
that
the
school
was
desegregated.
in
fact,
in
addition
to
everything
that
has
been
done,
if
there
is
a
specific
complaint
by
this
child,
that
there
is
an
avenue
of
relief
under
state
law.
but
we
don't
have
such
a
case,
do
we?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
to
basically
file
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
hope
you're
right.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
how
can
we
assume
that
the
affidavit
isn't
false?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
they
are
not
bearing
proof
in
here
particularly?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
of
course,
that
cuts
both
ways.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
could've
walked
over
there
and
filed
your
complaint,
and
it
might
have
been
tossed
out
but
you
could've
done
it.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so,
both
parties
here
are
relying
from
the
law
on
whether
they
are
of
more
than
expensed.
is
that
about
it?
