mr.
raymond
e.
harth
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
school
segregation
case
brought
under
the
civil
rights
act
section
1983,
pursuant
to
the
judicial
code
title
28
section
1343
subparagraph
3.
the
allegation
of
the
complaint
in
substance
is
that
the
plaintiff-children
had
been
compelled
to
attend
racially
segregated
public
schools
and
that
this
violates
their
rights
to
due
process
of
law
and
to
equal
protection
of
the
law
as
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
plaintiffs
are
negro
elementary
school
children
who
reside
in
centreville,
illinois.
now,
centreville
is
a
city
just
outside
of
east
st.
louis
in
southern
illinois.
and
they
attend
the
chenot
elementary
school
which
is
one
of
several
elementary
schools
operated
by
the
defendants
and
the
community
unit
school
district
number
187.
it
is
at
this
school
that
the
defendants
maintain
separate
classes
for
white
and
negro
students
in
the
same
school
building,
and
it
is
also
in
this
school
that
negro
children
are
required
to
use
separate
entrances
to
and
exits
from
the
school
building
from
those
used
by
the
white
children.
now,
the
chenot
school
is
relatively
new.
it
was
opened
in
the
year
1957
at
the
opening
of
the
school
year.
now,
the
complaint
alleges
that
this
school
was
planned
and
built
and
its
attendance
area
boundaries
were
intentionally
drawn
by
the
defendants
so
as
to
make
it
an
all-negro
school
in
the
students
enrolled.
now,
the
presence
of
the
white
children
in
the
school
at
the
present
time
was
something
that
happened
subsequent
to
that
period.
in
fact,
and
as
alleged
in
the
complaint,
all
children
of
elementary-school-age
who
reside
within
the
chenot
attendance
area
are
negroes.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
the
chenot
school
is
in
centreville.
it's
just
outside
--
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
it's
in
southern
illinois,
just
outside
this
city
of
east
st.
louis.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
yes.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
it
goes
much
further
south.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
--
this
is
not
in
the
very
southern
part.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
no.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
in
the
st.
louis
area,
that's
correct.
the
city
of
centreville,
in
fact,
is
adjacent
to
the
city
of
east
st.
louis.
now,
subsequent
to
the
opening
of
the
chenot
school
in
1957,
there
were
white
children
who
were
transferred
into
there
from
the
adjacent
centreville
school
area
but,
prior
to
the
opening
of
the
chenot
school,
the
negro
children
who
were
assigned
there
all
attended
the
centreville
elementary
school
which
was
also
attended
by
white
children.
however,
at
that
time,
the
defendants
achieved
the
segregation
by
requiring
all
negro
children
to
attend
classes
in
the
afternoons
exclusively
while
the
white
children
attended
school
in
the
mornings
exclusively.
now,
there
was
one
exception
in
the
case
of
certain
slow
fifth
and
sixth
grade
white
students
who,
because
of
the
academic
deficiencies,
attended
all
day.
except
for
that,
there
was
a
rigid
pattern
of
segregation
maintained
even
prior
to
the
opening
of
the
chenot
school.
now,
since
they
--
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
this
is
all
by
the
pleadings,
that's
correct,
and
by
the
motion
to
dismiss,
of
course,
the
defendants
admit
all
facts
while
pleading.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
yes.
now,
since
1957
and
because
of
overcrowding
at
the
adjacent
centreville
school,
certain
fifth
and
sixth
grade
classes
only
were
transferred
to
the
chenot
school
building.
now,
these
classes
consisted
of
approximately
97%
white
students
and
3%
negro
students.
now,
upon
being
transferred
to
the
chenot
school
harbor,
they
became
students
and
were
carried
on
the
roles
as
being
students
of
the
chenot
school
and
their
teachers
were
carried
on
the
role
as
faculty
members
of
the
chenot
elementary
school.
however,
the
complaint
alleges
that
these
classes
were
maintained
intact
while
at
this
chenot
school
in
pursuance
of
the
defendants'
plan
to
maintain
separate
classes
are
racially
for
white
and
negro
students.
now,
this
complaint
was
filed
a
few
days
after
the
opening
of
the
1961-1962
school
year,
and
it
refers
specifically
to
certain
statistics
from
the
1960
and
1961
school
year.
however,
the
amended
complaint
does
allege
that
all
or
substantially
all
of
these
same
conditions
which
we
allege
existed
in
1960
and
1961
were
true
for
the
then-current
school
year,
and
we
submit
that
this
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
the
point
which
is
raised
by
the
respondents
in
this
connection.
now,
as
alleged
in
the
complaint,
at
this
particular
time,
there
were
251
negro
students
and
254
white
students.
all
the
white
students
and
eight
of
the
negro
students
were
in
the
classes
which
were
transferred
from
the
centreville
school.
there
were
10
classes
with
only
negro
students
and
there
were
3
classes
with
only
white
students.
the
other
5
classes
of
the
total
of
18
had
8
negro
students
who
were
divided
along
with
about
146
white
students.
now,
except
for
these
eight,
all
the
negro
students
attended
classes
in
one
part
of
the
school
building
while
all
the
white
children
attended
--
negro
children
attended
classes
in
the
other
part
of
the
building
and,
further,
they
were
compelled
to
use
different
entrances
to
and
exits
from
the
same
school
building.
the
complaint
further
alleges
that
these
facts
continue
to
exist
through
the
then-current
school
year
despite
request,
demands,
and
pleas
to
the
defendants
to
cease
and
desist
from
their
actions.
it
further
alleged
that
the
defendants
were
acting
to
perpetuate
such
a
racially
segregated
public
school
system.
the
defendants
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
original
complaint
and
leave
of
court
was
granted
to
file
an
amended
complaint.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
the
complaint
asked
for
relief
of
a
declaratory
judgment
declaring
the
policies
of
the
defendants
violated
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
plaintiff-children.
it
asked
for
an
injunction
to
restrain
the
defendants
from
further
violating
the
constitutional
rights,
and
it
asked
that
the
court
order
the
defendants
to
submit
a
plan
for
desegregating
their
district.
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
extended
to
attack
the
amended
complaint
and,
in
substance,
the
motion
to
dismiss
said
that
the
complaint
failed
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted
because
the
plaintiffs
had
not
exhausted
certain
procedures
under
an
illinois
law,
referring
specifically
to
section
22-19
of
the
illinois
school
code.
now,
that
act
provides,
in
substance,
that
upon
the
filing
with
the
state
superintendent
of
public
instruction
of
a
complaint
signed
by
50
persons
or
10%
of
the
residents
of
the
school
district,
whichever
number
happen
to
be
the
smaller,
alleging
that
any
pupil
has
been
excluded
from
or
segregated
in
a
school
because
of
his
race,
that
the
state
superintendent,
on
receiving
such
a
complaint,
was
required
to
set
a
date
for
a
hearing.
it
also
provided
that
the
state
superintendent
may
set
a
date
for
a
hearing
whenever
he
has
reason
to
believe
any
such
discrimination
may
exist
in
a
school
district.
the
statute
provides
for
representation
of
the
parties
by
counsel
for
cross-examination,
subpoenaing
witnesses,
and
for
the
taking
of
depositions,
as
in
other
civil
actions.
now,
following
the
hearing
--
and
this
is
a
significant
part
of
the
statute,
following
the
hearing
before
the
state
superintendent,
he
must
decide
whether
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
substantially
correct.
now,
this
is
all
that
he
can
do
after
such
a
complaint
is
filed.
he
can
only
determine
whether
the
allegations
are,
and
i
quote
from
the
statute,
“substantially
correct”
and
if
he
does
so
determine,
he
shall
request,
and
the
statute
provides
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
statute,
“he
shall
request
the
attorney
general
to
apply
to
the
appropriate
circuit
court
for
such
injunctive
or
other
relief
as
may
be
necessary
to
rectify
the
practices
complained
of.”
it
gives
him
no
power,
no
authority
to
issue
any
cease
and
desist
orders
to
the
local
school
board
who
he
might
have
found
has
committed
acts
of
racial
segregation.
all
he
can
do
is
ask
the
attorney
general
to
institute
an
action
in
the
circuit
court
revealing
in
the
final
analysis,
of
course,
that
this
is
really
judicial
and
not
administrative.
the
plaintiffs
responded
to
this
motion
by
asserting
that
the
actions
being
brought
under
the
provisions
of
the
civil
rights
act
need
not
be
preceded
by
the
exhaustion
of
state
remedies,
and
that
the
remedies
referred
to
by
the
defendants
were
neither
administrative,
adequate,
or
available.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
the
court
did
refer
to
the
fact
that
we
did
not
even
attempt
to
invoke
the
state
remedies.
it
wasn't
a
matter
that
we
started
and
we
didn't
complete
them.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
until,
and
because
the
complaint
--
they
say
that
the
complaint
did
not
allege
acts
which
were
unconstitutional
in
themselves,
that
we
must
allege
in
the
complaint
that
we
have
exhausted
state
remedies.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
i
believe
that
the
opinions
said
--
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
i
believe
it
did
say
that,
“exhaustion,”
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
alright.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
well,
i
believe
the
court
said,
and
it's
on
page
29
in
the
records,
“because
the
amended
complaint
does
not
allege
school
board
policies
which
are
unconstitutional
in
themselves,
parents
are
required
to
resort
to
the
remedy
held
forth
in
the
illinois
school
code
before
seeking
the
aid
of
a
federal
court.”
so
what
the
court
is
saying
in
substance
is
that
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
in
a
case
of
this
type,
to
hear
and
determine
the
controversy
until
such
time
as
we
have
applied
for
a
remedy
under
the
state
statute.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
under
the
administrative
review
act
of
the
state
of
illinois,
an
appeal
could
be
taken
to
the
appropriate
circuit
court.
however,
the
court
in
that
case
could
not
substitute
its
findings
for
that
of
the
administrative
--
administrative
state
superintendent
could
merely
determine
whether
or
not
the
finding
was
contrary
to
the
manifest
weight
of
the
evidence.
now,
of
course,
the
district
court
sustained
the
motion
to
dismiss
because
of
the
failure
to
exhaust
and
the
court
of
appeals
pro
--
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
also
--
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
it
also
alleges
there
was
a
manipulation
of
the
school
boundary
lines
by
the
defendants
to
create
an
all-negro
school.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
that
is
correct.
we
think
that
the
holdings
of
this
court
have
so-indicated
as
well.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
the
fourth
circuit,
in
its
cases,
is
dealing
with
a
remedy
which
is
called
a
pupil
placement
act.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
those
cases
are
saying
is
that
these
acts,
having
been
passed
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
brown
versus
board
of
education,
appear
to
be
constitutional
on
their
faces
but
--
and
appear
to
provide
a
method
whereby
students
could
be
assigned
to
schools
on
a
non-discriminatory
basis.
and
so,
they
say
in
those
cases,
it
seems
to
me,
that
before
you
can
show
that
the
state
officials
have
discriminated
against
you,
you
must
apply
for
admission
to
school
in
accordance
with
those
statutes.
now,
i
might
point
out
some
of
the
later
cases
involving
pupil
placement
acts
in
the
fourth
circuit
have
found
that
the
application
of
those
statutes
has
been
unconstitutional
and
has
--
these
cases
upheld
that
they
need
not
be
complied
with
it
but
this
is
because
the
acts
have
been
unconstitutionally
applied.
the
principal
issue
therefore
presented
by
this
case
is
one
which
this
court
has
not
previously
decided
and
the
various
circuits
are
in
conflict
on
this
particular
point
and
litigation
proliferates
and,
probably,
substantive
rights
of
the
plaintiffs
in
these
cases
go
without
adjudication.
for
example,
in
the
southern
and
border
states
alone,
more
than
293
court
cases
had
been
filed
in
state
and
federal
courts
on
school
segregation
as
of
november
1962.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
at
the
time
that
we
recessed
for
lunch,
i
just
referred
to
the
fact
that
there
had
been
293
court
cases
filed
in
state
and
federal
courts
on
the
issue
of
school
segregation
up
to
1962.
now,
a
number
of
these
cases
have
been
going
back
and
forth
in
the
lower
federal
courts
because
of
a
good
deal
of
confusion
in
this
very
area
that
is
presented
by
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not,
in
a
civil
rights
action
against
school
segregation,
that
it's
necessary
to
exhaust
state
remedies.
now,
this
action
is
based
on
the
civil
rights
act
section
1983
which
provides
for
a
civil
action
for
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights
under
the
color
of
law.
now,
the
jurisdiction
in
this
case
is
asserted
under
section
13-43
subparagraph
(3)
which
provides
that
the
district
court
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
of
any
civil
action
which
is
brought
to
redress
the
deprivation
of
civil
rights
guaranteed
by
the
constitution.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
monroe
versus
pape,
exactly.
the
same
statutes
were
involved
in
both
cases
and,
i
might
point
out
to
the
court,
their
rule
that
the
fact
that
there
is
an
existence
of
state
remedy,
there's
no
bar
to
a
federal
remedy,
although,
there,
they
are
considering
the
damage
claim.
here,
we're
seeking
an
injunction.
and,
the
other
part
of
that
one
was
that
there
was
a
state
judicial
remedy,
but
the
court
said,
in
referring
to
monroe
versus
pape,
in
referring
to
that
fact,
that
the
fact
that
there
is
such
a
remedy
is
no
bar
to
relief
because
the
federal
remedy
is
supplementary
to
the
state
remedy
and
need
not
be
first
sought
and
reviewed
before
the
federal
right
is
invoked.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
the
court
of
appeals,
as
i
recall,
did
not
say
anything
about
that.
i
don't
recall
that
they
refer
to
the
case
monroe
versus
pape
at
all,
although
it
was
in
our
brief
there.
the
complaint
here
charges
that
the
plaintiff-children
had
been
deprived
of
due
process
of
law
and
equal
protection
of
the
law
by
the
defendants.
and,
the
principal
issue
then,
it
seems,
is
whether
any
suit
under
the
civil
rights
act
seeking
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
against
the
maintenance
of
a
racially
segregated
school
system
or
whether
the
plaintiffs
must,
first,
seek
a
remedy
provided
by
the
state
before
suing
in
the
federal
court.
now,
we
submit
that
the
answer
to
this
is
and
must
necessarily
be
in
the
negative
because
the
complaint
here
alleges,
among
other
things,
maintaining
separated
classes
and
facilities
for
white
and
negro
pupils
in
the
same
school.
now,
that
such
allegation
is
sufficient
to
show
a
deprivation
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
is
clear
from
this
court's
decision
many
years
ago
in
the
mclaurin
versus
oklahoma
state
regents
and,
further,
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
defendants
have
manipulated
the
attendance
area
lines
in
order
to
make
the
chenot
school
an
all-negro
school.
and,
again,
these
allegations
are
sufficient,
as
shown
by
the
decision
of
taylor
versus
board
of
education
of
new
rochelle
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
and,
i
might
also
point
out
by
comparison,
the
case
of
chameleon
versus
lightwood
recently
decided
by
this
court.
but
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
the
allegations
are
not
sufficient
to
allege
school
board
acts
which
are
unconstitutional
in
themselves.
as
to
this,
we
submit
that
the
lower
court
is
clearly
in
error.
the
court
went
on
to
say
that,
since
the
allegations
were
insufficient
to
allege
cons
--
acts
which
are
unconstitutional
in
themselves,
we
must,
therefore,
allege
the
exhaustion
of
the
state
remedy.
now,
there
is
no
doctrine
of
invoking
state
administrative
remedies
or
any
administrative
remedies.
if
it
is
required
at
all,
it
is
req
--
they
are
required
to
be
exhausted,
not
merely
invoked.
now,
it's
true
in
this
case,
we
did
not
--
not
only
did
not
exhaust,
but
we
did
not
even
invoke
them
because
of
our
position
that
it
was
not
necessary
and,
further,
because
of
the
inadequacy
of
the
remedy.
a
--
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
it
was
enacted
in
1961.
it
became
effective
july
1,
1961.
this
complaint
was
filed
september
1961.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
that's
correct.
for
many,
many
years,
this
has
been
the
case.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
this
is
a
relatively
new
procedure,
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
none
at
all.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
that
is
correct,
and
this
is
one
of
the
points
that
we
make.
it's
in
--
covered
in
our
brief
in
the
third
part.
that
this
remedy,
if
it
can
be
called
a
remedy
at
all,
is
unavailable
because
of
the
requirement
of
50
signatures
and
the
nature
of
a
constitutional
right
is
one
which
is
an
individual
right
and
cannot
be
made
to
defend
upon
the
consent
or
concurrence
of
any
number
of
other
persons.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
it
says
that
he
may,
yes.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
it
appears
in
the
--
in
section
22-19,
in
the
second
paragraph,
referring
to
our
brief
on
page
3
under
statutes
involved,
in
the
second
paragraph
which
starts
“the
superintendent
shall
fix
a
date
not
less
than
20.”
the
second
sentence
he
may
also
--
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
--
fix
a
date
for
hearing
whenever
he
has
reason
to
believe.”
now,
i
might
point
out
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
that
an
individual
may
request
the
state
superintendent
to
initiate
such
a
hearing
and
there'll
be
any
compulsion
by
him
to
do
this,
except
--
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
that
is
correct,
this
might
--
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
that's
correct.
this
might
very
well
happen.
we
don't
deny
this
at
all,
but
our
point
is,
though,
even
if
he
were
to
do
so
and
even
if
he
were
to
go
through
all
these
proceedings
of
conducting
a
hearing,
he
can
still
grant
no
relief.
his
action
is
limited
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
to
requesting
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
to
proceed
in
the
state
court.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
that's
a
request
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
isn't
anything
in
the
statute
which
provides
or
which
tells
the
attorney
general
that
he
must
exceed
to
such
a
request
and,
as
also
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
there's
some
question
as
to
whether
or
not
under
illinois
law
the
attorney
general
has
the
right
to
file
such
an
action
because
the
--
that
authority
is
not
granted
by
section
22-19,
except
possibly
by
implication.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
right,
what
--
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
that
is
correct,
it
might.
but,
you
see,
if
this
statute
is
going
to
be
interposed
between
these
plaintiffs
and
their
federal
remedy,
it
would
seem
to
us
that
there
should
be
some
more
compulsion
on
the
state
superintendent
to
conduct
such
a
hearing
rather
than
just
a
request.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
that's
a
separate
point,
yes.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
that's
correct.
now,
the
50
people,
if
there
is
a
signature
by
--
petition
by
50
people,
he
must
conduct
such
a
hearing.
he
must
conduct
it.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
“he
shall,”
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
but,
in
the
other
part,
it
said
“he
may.”
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
he
has
not.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
he
has
not.
might
i
point
out
that
he
was
originally
named
as
a
defendant
but
his
name
was
stricken
as
a
party-defendant
after
they
filed
the
amended
complaint.
now,
the
defendants,
in
moving
to
dismiss,
of
course
admit
all
facts
of
the
complaint
which
are
well
pleaded
and
what
they
are
saying,
therefore,
is
that
we
admit
that
we
planned
and
built
the
chenot
school
to
make
it
an
all-negro
school
and
that
we
did
this
by
drawing
its
attendance
area
boundaries
so
as
to
make
it
conform
to
the
negro
residential
area.
we
admit
further
that
prior
to
1957
that
negro
children
were
made
to
attend
classes
in
the
afternoons
while
the
white
children
attended
schools
in
the
morning.
and
we
further
admit
that
we
are
maintaining
separate
classes
for
white
and
negro
children
in
the
same
school
and
make
them
use
different
entrances
and
exits,
but
what
the
defendants
further
say
is
that
there
is
nothing
that
a
federal
court
can
do
about
this
until
the
plaintiffs
have
asked
the
state
superintendent
of
public
instruction
to
correct
what
we
have
done.
but,
the
defendants'
position
ignores
the
clear
and
explicit
language
of
the
statutes
which
give
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
of
this
case
and
which
give
rise
to
this
action,
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
section
1343
of
the
judicial
code.
now,
the
effect
of
the
decision
below
is
that
a
state
may
encumber
or
limit
this
federal
jurisdiction
which
is
granted
by
passing
a
statute
which
appears
to
grant
a
remedy
because
the
opinions
assume
that
the
exhaustion
of
state
administrative
remedies
or
state
remedies
is
jurisdictional
and
an
absolute
prerequisite
to
the
exercise
of
federal
judicial
powers.
now,
if
such
a
view
is
upheld,
i
submit
that
there
would
be
a
complete
abdication
of
federal
judicial
responsibility
which
would
deprive
the
petitioners
of
a
federal
forum
completely
and
remitting
them
to
the
remedies
made
available
by
the
state
with
the
implied
invitation,
of
course,
to
return
if
relief
is
not
secured
from
the
state.
now,
indeed,
if
such
is
to
be
the
rule,
then
access
to
federal
courts,
to
a
remedy
to
school
segregation
could
be
effectively
blocked
particularly
in
those
states
where,
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge,
there
is
a
strong
desire
to
maintain
the
status
quo.
now,
this
court
recently
had
occasion
to
consider
the
legislative
history
of
section
1983
which
gives
rise
to
this
action
and
consider
the
issue
on
existence
of
a
state
remedy,
and
that
was
the
case
of
monroe
versus
pape.
i
might
point
out
further
that
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
harlan
in
the
case
of
monroe
versus
pape,
considering
this
very
same
question
in
the
extent
to
which
the
congress
intended
to
give
a
federal
remedy,
stated
as
follows:
“the
statute
becomes
more
than
a
jurisdictional
provision
only
if
one
attributes
to
the
enacting
legislature
a
view
that
a
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right
is
significantly
different
from
and
more
serious
than
a
violation
of
a
state
right
and,
therefore,
deserves
a
different
remedy,
even
though
the
same
act
may
constitute
of
a
state
tort
in
the
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right.
now,
while
the
court
there
was
talking
about
a
tort
action
brought
by
an
individual,
the
same
basic
reasoning,
i
would
think,
would
hold
true
here.
the
existence
of
a
state
remedy
is
no
bar
to
the
federal
remedy
which
is
provided
by
a
federal
law.
the
court
considered
the
debates
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
1983
and
of
section
1343,
and
it
found
that
the
spirits
of
tho
--
the
spirit
of
those
acts
was
the
access
to
the
federal
courts
for
redress
of
civil
rights
was
not
to
be
delayed
by
the
availability
or
non-availability
of
state
remedies.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
the
decision
in
harrison
versus
naacp?
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
as
i
recall,
this
involved
a
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
certain
statutes
and
i
would
say,
no.
this
--
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
that
is
correct,
but
the
case
of
harrison
versus
naacp
involved
a
question
of
interpretation
of
the
state
law
which
we
do
not
have,
at
this
point,
in
this
case
and,
indeed,
the
dissent
did
say
that
since
this
was
a
civil
right
--
rights
act
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
that
the
doctrine
of
abstention
was
inappropriate.
this
point
has
been
urged
with
great
force,
as
i
recall,
on
many
occasions,
that
congress
intended
to
treat
civil
rights
violation
different
from
other
violations
and
this
is,
of
course,
as
indicated
by
the
fact
that
in
a
damage
action,
for
instance,
it's
not
necessary
to
have
the
jurisdictional
amount
in
controversy.
indeed,
one
could
be
filed
if
the
amount
were
$10,
$15,
or
$100
involved.
now
--
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
that
is
correct
but
this
would
involve
the
question,
and
this
would
have
been
true
not
only
in
a
civil
rights
case
but
in
any
other
one
where
there's
a
question
of
interpretation
of
state
law.
here,
the
--
there,
the
plaintiffs
were
asking
for
there
to
be
a
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
of
a
state
statute
and
there,
of
course,
you
were
very
--
had
the
problem
of
a
federal
court
declaring
unconstitutional
state
action,
which
of
course
the
courts
have
a
reluctance
to
do.
if
they
can
reasonably
avoid
it
without
unduly
limiting
the
person's
rights
which
may
have
been
granted
under
federal
law.
and
the
court,
as
i
recall,
held
there
that,
until
such
time
that
the
state
court
held
that
the
statute
was
applicable,
that
federal
court
--
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
that's
correct.
now,
these
cases
which
have
involved
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
i
might
point
out,
have
been
where
the
administrative
remedies
sought
has
been
the
agency
itself
which
has
caused
the
violation
of
rights.
to
my
knowledge,
this
is
the
first
case
that's
been
presented
to
this
court
where
it
has
been
contended
that
you
must
go
to
a
state
agency
for
review
of
another
state
agency
before
you
can
come
into
a
federal
court,
and
this
is
significantly
different.
there
had
been
those
cases
which
have
held
that
the
administrative
remedies
would
have
to
be
exhausted
before
granting
judicial
relief
in
many
other
areas,
not
just
limited
to
civil
rights.
but,
that
doctrine
is
based
upon
the
existence
and
ability
of
an
administrative
body
to
hear
and
adequately
dispose
of
the
entire
controversy
in
a
reasonably
expeditious
manner.
otherwise,
there
would
be
no
reason
for
requiring
a
person
to
resort
to
any
such
remedies.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
our
position
would
still
be
the
same
on
the
first
point
that
we
would
not
be
required
to
submit
to
those
procedures
before
we
would
be
entitled
to
come
into
a
federal
court.
whatever
remedy
that
he
would
give
or
could
give,
assuming
that
he
had
this
built-in
provisions,
would
certainly
be
a
significantly
different
remedy
from
that
which
would
be
provided
by
a
court
and
a
judgment
--
a
declaratory
judgment.
so
that,
we'd
be
--
in
that
case,
we
would
say
that
this
would
not
be
an
absolute
bar
to
a
proceeding
under
the
federal
act
as
the
court
below
has
held
in
this
case.
however,
the
statute
involved
here
does
not
provide
such
a
remedy
and
i
would
point
out
that
it
is
quite
similar
to
the
statute
which
was
before
this
court
in
the
case
of
u.s.
alkali
association
versus
u.s.
and,
in
that
case,
there
was
one
which
was
brought
under
the
sherman
act.
the
section
5
of
the
webb-pomerene
act
provided
that,
before
an
action
--
an
antitrust
action
should
be
instituted
against
the
trade
association,
that
the
federal
trade
commission
should
conduct
a
hearing
into
the
alleged
violations,
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing,
it
would
make
a
recommendation
to
the
association
that
it
rectify
its
practices,
and
if
it
did
not
do
so,
then
it
would
request
the
attorney
general
to
take
such
action
as
he
might
deem
proper.
and,
the
court,
in
that
case,
rejected
an
argument
that
equity
should
not
appear
and
advance
such
a
process
by
pointing
out
that,
under
the
section
5
of
the
webb-pomerene
act,
the
only
function
of
the
federal
trade
commission
was
to
investigate,
recommend,
and
report.
it
pointed
out
that
it
could
make
no
controlling
finding
of
law
or
fact
and
its
recommendation
need
not
to
be
followed
by
any
court
or
administrative
officer,
or
executive
officer.
and
the
court
there
held
that
such
are--
such
a
statute,
since
it
did
not
provide
a
remedy,
need
not
be
exhausted
before
this
action
could
be
instituted.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
no,
it
does
not
--
we
do
not
contend
this.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
no,
absolutely
not.
it
appears,
from
all
that
we
can
see
as
to
be
simply
a
method
whereby
it
gives
the
state
superintendent
power
to
investigate
charges
of
racial
discrimination
which
the
school
code
doesn't
otherwise
give
him,
but
it
will
noted
in
the
view
of
the
fact
that
it's
limited
to
investigating.
it
does
not
give
a
remedy.
it
was
not
intended,
it
seems
to
us,
to
give
any
remedy
and,
certainly,
it
was
--
i
would
not
ascribe
to
the
legislature
any
intention
to
try
to
block
parties
from
going
into
federal
court
by
passing
such
a
statute.
we
certainly
do
not
contend
that.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
well,
it
is
our
position
that
this
does
not
give
him
any
specific
authority,
in
that,
unless
there
is
a
specific
grant
of
authority
to
an
official,
i
guess
he
doesn't
have
it.
there's
nothing
specific
--
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
the
st
--
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
we
know
of
no
such
order
by
the
state
superintendent
at
all.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
i
beli
--
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
i
don't
recall
that
that
was
in
there
but,
i
do
recall,
i
believe
it
was
1870
that
the
constitution
was
--
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
i
would
say
so.
i
might
point
out,
in
regard
to
this
question,
if
the
legislature
had
intended
to
give
the
state
superintendent
authority
to
correct
discrimination
that
it
had
found
to
exist,
it
would
have
been
very
simple
for
it
to
have
done
so
right
in
section
22-19
by
saying,
in
addition
to
it
--
or
instead
of
requesting
the
attorney
general
to
institute
an
action
to
say
that
he
may
then
issue
cease
and
desist
orders
and
so
forth,
but
the
statute
manifestly
does
not
do
that.
now,
the
court,
we
might
further
point
out,
in
connection
to
this,
the
50-signature
requirement
of
the
statute
is
again
a
reason
why
we
should
not
be
required
to
comply
with
that.
and
even
considering
the
fact
that
the
state
superintendent
may
institute
such
a
hearing
on
his
own
motion,
there
is
nothing
in
there
to
say
that
he
must
do
so.
so
that,
in
substance,
we
say
that
this
being
an
action
under
civil
rights
act
and
since
section
13-43
gives
the
s
--
district
courts
original
jurisdiction,
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
to
provide
a
federal
remedy
for
civil
rights
and
constitutional
violations
without
the
parties
having
first
to
exhaust
any
state
remedies
before
coming
into
federal
court,
thank
you.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
in
monroe
versus
pape,
it
was
a
damage
action
and
the
court,
in
ruling
that
the
city
of
chicago
was
not
liable
under
1983
for
damages,
recall
that
the
court
went
into
the
legislative
history
again
of
13
--
of
1983
and
of
attempts
to
make
cities
pecuniarily
reliable
for
civil
rights
violation
and
concluded
that
it
was
not
definitely
not
intended
that
they
do
so.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
and
not
--
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
not
damages.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
that's
right.
that
is
correct
because
the
reasons
--
the
basic
reasons
for
holding
a
city
to
be
not
liable
for
civil
damages,
of
course,
do
not
apply
to
prospective
relief.
indeed,
there
are
cases
in
which
this
court
previously
has
indicated
sanction
provision
of
injunction
against
municipalities,
thank
you.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
oh
i'm
sorry.
i
wasn't
aware
of
it.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
may
it
please
the
court.
the
latest
point
just
raised
by
mr.
boman,
of
course,
it's
true
that
the
amended
complaint
was
filed
on
the
date
this
hearing
was
held.
now,
he
seems
to
be
saying
that
he
now
has
some
regrets
about
having
extended
his
motion
to
dismiss
to
our
amended
complaint
in
view
of
our
having
withdrawn
our
the
motion
for
temporary
injunction.
however,
he
has
never
withdrawn
it
up
to
this
point.
i
might
point
out
too,
that
the
counsel,
and
both
of
them,
had
gone
substantially
outside
of
the
record
and
i
think
that
we
must
confine
ourselves
to
the
record
here.
and
just
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
had
pointed
out
that
we
must
take
it
on
the
facts
as
alleged
in
the
record,
as
alleged
and
we
must
take
them
as
being
true.
now,
first
of
all,
this
is
not
a
suit
against
the
state.
this
is
a
suit
against
a
state
agency.
it
is
against
the
local
board
of
education
whom
we
claim
has
discriminated
against
these
defendants,
the
plaintiffs
here.
the
defendants
say
that
we
must,
before
we
can
come
into
a
federal
court,
exhaust
state
remedies.
now,
there
are
a
couple
of
lower
court
decisions
on
this
very
specific
point.
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
have
to
meet
with
the
same
problem
about
a
contention
that
where
there
was
a
claim
of
discrimination,
that
you
would
first
have
to
appeal
to
the
state
board
--
superintendent
of
education,
and
that
was
in
the
case
of
borders
v.
rippy
where
the
court
said,
that's
reported
incidentally
at
247
f.2d
268,
texas
state
law
gave
the
board
and
the
local
superintendent
the
power
to
act,
and
that
is
of
course
true
here.
as
pointed
out
in
the
briefs,
the
state
statutes
give
the
local
of
board
of
education
the
power
to
assign
children
to
school
and
to
draw
attendance
area
lines.
the
court
went
further
to
say,
that
in
the
exercise
of
such
power,
they
have
denied
the
plaintiffs
the
right
to
attend
public
schools
of
their
choice
solely
on
account
of
their
race
or
color.
by
such
action,
the
plaintiffs
have
been
denied
their
constitutional
right
and
they
are
not
required
to
seek
redress
from
any
administrative
body
before
applying
to
the
courts,
and
it
cited
some
other
cases
in
support
of
that
proposition.
now,
i
might
point
out
also
that,
at
this
point
at
least,
the
neighborhood
school
policy
is
not
before
this
court.
it
may
become
before
the
court
or
the
lower
court
at
some
time
in
the
future,
but
it's
not
before
the
court
at
this
point.
what
is
before
the
court
at
this
point
is
the
claim
in
the
complaint
that
the
defendants
have
intentionally
drawn
the
attendance
area
lack
of
boundaries
of
the
chenot
school,
this
is
the
only
one
that
is
made
specific
at
this
point,
to
make
it
an
all-negro
school
in
its
student
enroll.
now,
the
--
mr.
boman
so
--
seemed
to
me
that
he
conceded
that
under
these
facts
that
we
alleged,
that
we
are
entitled
to
some
type
of
equitable
action.
well,
actually,
this
is
all
that
we
are
seeking
in
this
complaint,
is
equitable
relief.
we
are
asking
for
declaratory
judgment
and
for
an
injunction.
now,
the
--
this
act
is
based
on
1983
and
on
section
13-43
subparagraph
(3)
of
the
judicial
code
which
provides
a
right
for
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment
guarantees
and
which
is
exactly
what
we
have
in
this
case,
claim
of
the
denial
of
due
process
of
law
and
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
he
referred
also
to
decisions
in
the
eighth
circuit
referring,
i
assume,
specifically
to
the
case
of
parham
versus
dove,
being
one
in
support
of
their
proposition
that
administrative
remedies
would
have
to
be
exhausted.
but
even
in
parham
versus
dove,
the
court
of
appeals
in
reversing
the
case
directed
the
lower
court
to
issue
an
injunction
to
restrain
the
defendants
for
maintaining
a
racially
segregated
school
system,
but
what
it
said
was
that
the
individual
plaintiffs
in
that
case,
because
of
the
dual
nature
of
a
class
action,
that
is
for
the
protection
of
the
individual
rights
of
the
individual
plaintiffs
and
for
the
protection
of
the
rights
of
the
class
as
a
whole,
it
directed
that
there'd
be
an
issuance
of
an
injunction
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
class
as
a
whole
but
said
that,
before
the
court
can
determine
whether
the
individual
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
relief,
they
must
apply
under
the
pupil
placement
act
of
the
state
of
arkansas
to
determine
whether
they
are
entitled
to
admission
to
particular
schools.
but,
we
don't
have
that
in
this
case.
we
don't
have
a
case
here
where
the
plaintiffs
are
seeking
admission
to
any
particular
school.
now,
again,
there's
a
good
deal
of
time
spent
on
referring
to
the
other
sanctions
that
the
state
superintendent
might
impose,
and
they
refer
to
the
withholding
of
funds.
well,
now,
the
statutory
reference
to
that
says
that
before
a
state
--
before
a
local
school
board
is
entitled
to
get
funds
from
the
state,
there
must
be
an
affidavit
filed
stating
that
no
discrimination
exists
in
the
school
district.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
that
if
the
state
superintendent
receives
such
an
affidavit,
even
though
he
may
know
it
to
be
false,
that
he
can
withhold
funds.
he
has
no
discretion.
he
is
given
no
discretion.
once
he
gets
the
affidavit,
he
must
dispense
the
funds.
and
to
say
that
it
can
be
assumed
that
he
will
withhold
these
funds
is
certainly
--
was
not
certain
enough
in
terms
of
giving
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
a
remedy.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
i
would
have
to
assume
that,
since
this
district,
district
187,
has
gotten
state
funds
and
since,
in
the
allegations
of
our
complainant,
it
shows
that
there
has
been
discrimination
in
the
school
district,
that
there
must
be
either
a
false
affidavit
or
an
affidavit
by
a
person
who
does
not
know
the
facts.
we
cannot
assume,
in
all
cases,
that
there
will
be
a
false
affidavit,
but
i'm
saying
that
under
these
circumstances,
so
far
as
the
law
reads,
all
that
the
state
superintendent
can
do
is
to
refuse
to
pay
out
funds
if
he
gets
--
unless
he
receives
an
affidavit.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
to
a
certain
extent,
yes.
but,
on
the
other
hand,
in
view
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
which
we
have
here
which
shows
a
history
of
segregation
within
this
school
district,
dating
back
prior
to
1957
when
they
had
children
attending
school
at
different
times,
and
that
this
has
been
con
--
permitted
to
continue
to
exist,
then
we
do
not
have
a
different
situation
here
than
you
would
have
there.
i
think
we
have
perhaps
a
more
subtle
attempt
to
maintain
segregation
because
certainly,
in
the
other
states,
they
make
no
bones
about
just
what
they're
attempting
to
do.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
they
are
not.
and,
certainly,
as
they
point
out,
certainly
a
single
individual
might
have
requested
the
state
superintendent
to
initiate
a
procedure
by
the
same
token,
so
could
the
school
board.
once
this
complaint
had
been
filed,
the
school
board
could
have
said
to
the
state
superintendent,
“look,
we
find
ourselves
involved
in
a
federal
court
suit
claiming
discrimination.
will
you
please
make
an
investigation
so
that
we
can
clear
this
thing
up?”
but
certainly,
this
has
not
been
done.
and,
certainly,
i
would
think
that
the
state
superintendent
would
exceed
more
to
request
a
school
board
who
is
involved
in
a
federal
litigation
than
he
would
a
single
individual
who
might
say,
“they're
discriminating
against
me
in
this
school.”
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
it
does.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
yes,
we
might
have.
that's
true.
but,
our
positi
--
our
basic
position
is
that,
since
our
action
is
based
on
the
civil
rights
act,
that
no
state
statute
maybe
interposed
between
these
plaintiffs,
who
had
been
discriminated
against,
and
we
have
to
take
it
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
their
federal
remedy.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
i
would
say
that
this
is
true,
yes.
again,
the
--
all
these
points
that
the
defendants
make
concerning
possible
sanctions,
possible
criminal
sanctions
against
those
who
discriminate,
possible
withdrawal
of
certification
and
all
are
so
uncertain
that
they
should
not
be
held
to
be
a
requirement
to
these
plaintiffs
before
they
come
into
a
federal
court.
i
referred
to
the
case
of
hillsborough
township
versus
cromwell
in
which
there
was
a
consideration
given
to
whether
a
state
remedy
would
have
to
be
exhausted
involving
taxation.
and
the
court
held
that
the
state
remedy
involved
was
not
a
matter
of
right
but
was
discretionary
and
was
a
part
of
the
basis
for
holding
that
the
remedy
was
too
uncertain
and
speculative
to
be
as
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient
remedy
which
would
preclude
a
court
of
equity
--
a
federal
court
of
equity
from
granting
relief.
thank
you.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
that
is
correct.
under
the
school
code,
it
provides
that
before
a
--
before
a
local
board
is
entitled
to
receive
state
funds,
it
must
file
an
affidavit
stating
that
there's
no
discrimination,
and
it
provides
that
upon
--
that
the
state
superintendent,
upon
receipt
of
such
affidavit,
shall
certify
to
the
state
auditor
that
this
local
board
may
receive
whatever
the
funds
that's
based
on
the
attendance
of
the
school
district.
mr.
raymond
e.
harth
that
is
correct.
