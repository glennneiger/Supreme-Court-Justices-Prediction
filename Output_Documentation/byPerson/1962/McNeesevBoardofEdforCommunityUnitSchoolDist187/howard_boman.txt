mr.
howard
boman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
isn't
any
evidence
before
the
court,
and
for
that
reason,
one
may
draw
conclusions,
some
of
which
had
been
hinted
at
by
this
time
as
to
what
the
situation
really
is
in
this
school
district
and,
if
i
may
go
off
the
record
just
a
minute
or
outside
of
the
record,
i
would
say
this,
that
the
--
well,
we
haven't
got
to
this
point,
but
every
charge
of
discrimination
made
by
mr.
harth
here,
orally
or
in
the
complaint,
will
at
that
time
ever
comes
be
denied
and
proof
will
be
rendered
against
that.
and
it's
a
highly
fictional
thing,
i
think
the
court
recognizes,
for
mr.
harth
to
get
up
and
say
that
we
admit
that
children
have
to
use
separate
doors,
or
separate
toilets,
or
separate
drinking
fountains,
or
they're
put
in
a
separate
part
of
the
building.
that
is
not
true
and
that
is
denied.
that
will
be
denied
when
the
proper
time
comes,
but
we
would
very
vigorously
try
to
have
your
honors
understand
that
what
you're
dealing
with
here
is
not
a
school
district
which
is
in
some
backwater
at
illinois
which
sends
1,872
as
resist
to
these
things.
this
is
a
part
of
the
metropolitan
area
of
st.
louis
on
the
east
side.
there
are
about
5,500
students
in
the
school
district.
i
think
there
are
11
elementary
schools.
there's
a
junior
high
school.
there's
a
senior
high
school.
there
are
colored
children
in
all
of
the
schools,
in
my
understanding.
now,
what
we
have
here
is
the
chenot
school
which
is
located
up
to
the
north
of
the
district
which
touches
the
city
of
east
st.
louis.
and
the
city
of
east
st.
louis
has
a
large
colored
population.
much
of
the
population
over
the
last
few
years
has
moved
gradually
south
entering
into
this
district.
by
“last
few
years,”
i
mean
since
the
war.
mr.
howard
boman
as
such,
it
was
created
in
1949.
mr.
howard
boman
in
1949
and
1951,
there
was
annexation
of
the
period,
the
territory
that
these
--
that
we're
interested
in
here
now.
mr.
howard
boman
the
particular
area
that's
involved
in
this
case
was
annexed
in
1951
or
1953.
i'm
not
quite
sure.
now
--
so,
those
matters,
i
want
to
make
clear,
are
resisted.
and,
what
ha
--
mr.
howard
boman
i
hope
not,
sir,
but
the
impression,
even
as
i
sit
here
and
hear
it,
is
--
makes
me
cringe
a
little
bit
and
i
would
not
want
that
impression
to
be
accepted
at
face
value.
what
you
really
have,
as
you
see
in
the
complaint
here,
is
an
attack
upon
the
neighborhood
school
policy
which
has
been
made
in
many
cases
and
i
think
that
this
is
probably
the
first
case
to
come
before
this
court
where
the
court
allowed
certiorari
where
that
was
the
attack.
and
that's
made
clear
in
the
complaint
and
these
other
things
given
by
mr.
harth
today
or
cited
as
an
example
of,
and
then
they
delineate
those
various
charges.
but
the
complaint,
if
one
reads
the
complaint,
we'll
see
it
is
an
attack
upon
the
neighborhood
school
of
policy
as
such
and
since
the
chenot
school
district
is
in
the
area
where
there
is
a
predominance
or
where
i
think
it's
all
coming
from
probably,
and
it's
colored
board
of
the
south,
and
the
centreville
school
that
they
speak
of
then
there
is
a
mixture
in
residential
housing
of
the
two
races.
the
problem
comes,
although
it's
here
and
there
all
over.
mr.
howard
boman
i
frankly
don't
know.
the
complaint
or
one
of
the
briefs
here
says
how
many
there
are
in
the
chenot
school
and
i
think
some
275
children
or
so.
i
don't
think
records
are
maintained
on
that
basis,
although
i
suppose
you
could
count
heads.
but
it
would
be
a
perhaps
less
than
10%
of
the
5,500,
would
be
my
guess.
mr.
howard
boman
yes,
but
that's
just
in
the
elementary
school.
mr.
howard
boman
yes,
sir,
and
then
there
are
good
many
colored
children
in
the
centreville
school
system
--
centreville
school
district
which
adjoins
the
chenot
school
and
there's
a
sprinkling
--
predominantly
white
schools
but
a
sprinkling
where
there
are
negro
families
in,
as
i
understand,
all
of
the
other
grade
schools.
mr.
howard
boman
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
boman
yes
sir,
yes.
mr.
howard
boman
yes
sir,
i
suppose,
for
that
limited
purpose.
now,
we
raise
it
here
that
the
defense
that
there
is
and
can
be
no
suit
against
the
school
district
as
such
under
monroe
versus
pape.
we
equate
the
school
district
with
the
city
of
chicago
in
monroe
versus
pape
which
directly
held
that.
we
see
nothing
to
distinguish
the
two
situations
whatsoever,
either
in
the
philosophy
of
the
act
or
in
the
language
of
the
act.
so,
we
think
that
although
the
ground
was
not
urged
below
by
anybody,
it
was
not
contended
that
they
were
support
by
monroe
versus
pape.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
when
this
case
was
filed,
monroe
versus
pape
was
still
in
the
advance
sheets.
as
far
as
i
was
concerned,
i
didn't
see
it.
but
it
also
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seven
circuit
which
had
decided
monroe
versus
pape
and
was
reversed
and
nobody
raised
it
there.
but,
in
all
candor,
we
think
that
that
is
a
complete
lore
to
this
action
as
against
the
school
district.
now,
we
have
pointed
that
the
superintendent
of
the
schools
is
a
party
that's,
mr.
catley.
although,
in
the
complaint
he
is
just
lumped
with
the
school
district,
they'll
just
say,
“defendants,
defendants,
defendants,”
and
no
separate
attention
was
paid
to
any
responsibilities
that
he
might
have
under
the
civil
rights
act
as
a
superintendent
from
the
school
district.
so,
we
say
that
that
matter
has
not
been
litigated
and
it
has
not
been
briefed
up
to
this
point.
mr.
howard
boman
sir?
mr.
howard
boman
i
don't
see
any
distinction
between
the
two.
it's
a
question
--
i
believe,
the
act
says
“every
person,”
and
the
court
held
that
a
municipality
is
not
a
person
and
the
--
mr.
howard
boman
the
same
section.
mr.
howard
boman
yes,
sir.
the
same
section,
yes.
and,
the
court
was
unanimous
there.
justice
frankfurter
who
had
dissented,
of
course,
did
not
dissent
as
to
that
aspect
of
monroe
versus
pape.
so,
that
was
a
unanimous
holding.
mr.
howard
boman
the
petitioners?
mr.
howard
boman
of
course,
there
is
remedies
galore
in
the
state
of
illinois.
we
say
there
is
no
remedy
here
or
in
the
federal
court
system
as
against
the
school
district
under
the
civil
rights
act.
now,
i
think
there's
the
general
equity
power
of
the
federal
courts.
i
think
your
southern
cases
would
be
an
antecedent
for
this
case
based
upon
equity.
however,
they
hinge
their
entire
case
on
the
civil
rights
act
as
against
the
school
district
as
well
as
against
the
individual.
mr.
howard
boman
i
should
think
so,
sir.
mr.
howard
boman
i'm
not
able
to
say
that
right
off,
but
i
should
think
under
the
same
ways
that
they
went
into
the
southern
states
for
equitable
relief
in
many,
many
instances
claiming
a
denial
of
rights
of
children
secured
to
them
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
howard
boman
yes
sir,
that's
true.
mr.
howard
boman
i
think
so,
and
that's
why
we've
continued
to
argue
this
saying
that,
there,
clearly,
the
administrative
remedy
as
an
alternative
would
be
a
defense.
and,
the
brief
goes
on
and
does
say,
in
effect,
that
if
one
considers
either
the
point
have
been
waived
or,
if
the
court
would
consider
this
without
regard
to
form
that
there,
the
court
should
take
cognizance
of
the
illinois
statute,
which
we
claim
to
be
adequate,
and
require
that
petitioners
to
use
that
in
those
means.
now,
the
courts
of
appeals
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
in
the
eighth
circuit
have
required
that.
and
the
court
of
appeals
(inaudible)
in
a
series
of
cases,
has
frequently
not
required
that
and
we
have
pointed
out,
and
i
think
it's
obvious
there
that
the
administrative
remedy
being
considered
was
usually
something
that
was
far
from
adequate.
it
would
be
a
vain
and
a
useless
thing
to
require
them
to
go
through
that
sort
of
useless
procedure.
now,
in
illinois,
the
segregation
in
the
public
schools
has
been
unconstitutional
since
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
which
i
believe
was
in
1872,
and
the
court
in
1901
especially
--
specifically
rejected
a
separate
but
equal
interpretation
of
our
constitution.
and
the
school
code
of
illinois
has,
for
a
long
time,
prohibited
a
school
district
from
being
excluded
or
segregated
according
to
color.
furthermore,
the
school
code
for
many
years,
what
is
now
the
school
code,
has
made
it
a
criminal
offense
for
any
school
officer
or
other
person
to
exclude
from
the
public
schools
on
account
of
color
any
child
and
--
or
anybody
who
threatens
or
intimidates
or
menaces
that
child
in
pursuing
that.
now,
those
statutes
have
preceded
your
brown
versus
the
board
of
education
by
a
good
number
of
years.
the
legislature
has
attempted
to
put
more
teeth
in
those
things
in
the
postwar
years.
and,
in
one
of
those,
they
provided,
first,
by
a
writer
to
an
appropriation
bill
and,
later,
in
substantive
law
that
no
school
could
participate
in
state
funds
as
long
as
there
was
a
practice
of
discrimination
in
the
schools.
and,
in
illinois,
at
least
the
school
district
of
this
type,
the
lands
on
state
funds
is
vital.
about
25%
of
the
budget
comes
from
the
state
of
illinois.
and
it
is
required
that
a
school
official
verify
annually
with
a
claim
for
state
money
that
there
has
not
in
fact
been
a
violation
of
the
segregation
provisions
of
the
school
code.
now,
the
state
superintendent
of
public
instruction,
as
the
state
official,
he
has
the
duty
of
transmitting
to
the
state
dispersing
official
these
claims
for
the
several
school
districts.
in
fact
the
law
says
that
he
shall
certify
those
and
the
auditor
of
public
accounts
would
not
pay
out
any
money
without
that
certification.
that's
an
important
point
in
our
argument.
the
same
official,
the
state
superintendent
of
public
instruction,
is
the
party
who
is
required
to
hold
the
hearings
under
section
22-19,
upon
the
receipt
of
a
petition
signed
by
50
voters
or
more,
or
who
may
initiate
the
proceeding
on
his
own
motion.
and
the
proceeding
that's
outlined
in
the
statute
which
maybe
begun
like
that
is
fairly
simple.
he
may
appoint
a
hearing
officer,
take
evidence,
and
make
a
finding
as
to
whether
or
not
the
complaint
was
justified.
now,
we
stop
at
that
point
and
say
that
is
sufficient,
as
far
as
the
use
of
section
22-19
goes,
to
ensure
the
rights
of
the
petitioners
because
it
is
inconceivable
that
in
a
state
where
segregation
is
unconstitutional,
and
whether
statute
after
statute
in
favor
of
the
policy
of
non-segregation,
that
a
state
official
who
makes
a
finding
that
there
is
segregation
in
school
district
number
187,
he
could
not,
the
next
day,
certify
the
request
for
funds
to
that
same
school
district
and
close
his
eyes
to
the
fact
that
there
was
the
thing
that
prevents
them
from
getting
the
money.
now,
that
is
as
close,
i
think,
as
one
will
ever
find
to
an
adequate
remedy
and
was
the
purpose
of
it,
of
course,
to
have
these
rights
adjudicated
because
the
state
superintendent
can
either,
he
can
block
the
money
which
will
bring
the
school
district
to
its
knees
or
he
can
revoke
a
certificate
of
recognition
to
the
school
district
for
the
same
reason,
and
that's
one
of
the
standards
incidentally
that
he
uses,
and
that
would
deny
the
rights
of
the
graduates
not
to
go
to
university
without
examinations
and
rights
of
the
teachers
to
write
some
of
the
pension
act
and
host
to
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
howard
boman
it's
quoted
in
full.
it's
on
page
4
and
on
page
five.
one,
two,
three,
fourth
paragraph,
second
to
the
last
paragraph.
mr.
howard
boman
and
we
say
then
that
that
is
an
adequate
remedy
of
law.
in
answer
to
a
question
put
earlier
about
has
the
superintendent
ever
revoke
a
certificate,
i
don't
know
of
any
revocation
but
i
know
of
where
threats
was
made
in
the
case
of
school
boards
that
were
not
managing
the
money
properly
and
he
caused
their
removal
by
a
threat
to
withdraw
the
certification
and
the
board,
of
course,
then
had
to
resign,
which
was
his
purpose.
the
point
is
made
that
the
50
signatures
is
a
burdensome
requirement
and
i
would
say
this
that
this
is,
first
of
all,
a
class
action,
the
district
court
so-looked
at
it
as
a
class
action,
and
probably,
it
would
not
be
a
difficult
thing
to
obtain.
but,
in
any
event,
we
would
rest
our
case
by
saying
that
if
the
state
superintendent
had
presented
to
him
a
colorable
case
of
segregation
by
one
person
and
he
did
nothing
about
it,
that
that
petitioner
could
then
go
in
the
federal
court
and
proceed
there
because
i
think,
in
that
case,
he
would
not
be
following
the
law.
the
state
superintendent
would
not
--
mr.
howard
boman
and
he
turned
him
down.
mr.
howard
boman
i
think
that
petitioner
would
then
have
done
all
that
he
would
have
to
do
under
the
illinois
remedy.
mr.
howard
boman
it
says
“shall.”
when
in
connection
with
50,
it
says
“may
otherwise.”
mr.
howard
boman
yes.
mr.
howard
boman
and
when
the
district
court
pursued
at
that
point.
mr.
howard
boman
i
should
think
so,
sir.
now,
we're
--
mr.
howard
boman
i
should
think
so.
we're
now
talking
not
about
the
civil
rights
act,
as
i
understand
it,
but,
proceeding
under
the
equitable
powers,
against
the
school
district,
and
i
would
say,
yes,
he
would
have
to
show
that
attempt
to
comply
and
that
the
superintendent
arbitrarily
turned
him
down.
mr.
howard
boman
i
don't
know
what
the
superintendent
might
do.
assuming
that
he
was
an
honest
individual,
and
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that,
and
the
meant
to
carry
out
the
law
of
the
state
of
illinois,
i
suppose
you
could
get
a
crackpot
type
thing
he
might
turn
down.
in
which
case,
i
should
think
then
the
federal
court
would
have
probably
to
litigate
the
merits
of
the
turn
down.
mr.
howard
boman
i
would
think
so.
i
would
think
if
they
couldn't
raise
the
50
signatures
they
need
because
they
were
fearful
or
indifferent.
mr.
howard
boman
yes.
mr.
howard
boman
and,
i
should
think,
if
there
were
10,
they
should
go,
or
if
there
was
one
child,
he
should
go
to
his
parents.
mr.
howard
boman
of
course,
i
live
300
miles
from
chicago
and
don't
know
what
the
situation
up
there
was.
in
certain
areas,
certainly,
and
i
can
think
this,
close
to
home
there,
the
city
schools
in
the
city
of
east
st.
louis
were
segregated
i
don't
think
until
brown,
but
i
think
until
the
legislature
put
its
writer
on
the
appropriation
bill.
i
believe
that's
what
it
was.
now,
that
is,
at
certain
levels,
like
the
elementary
schools,
not
the
separate
high
schools,
in
that
type
of
thing.
mr.
howard
boman
i
suppose
he
was
at
liberty.
mr.
howard
boman
he
might
have
noticed
that,
yes,
and
--
mr.
howard
boman
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
howard
boman
the
state
superintendent
is
not
a
party,
no.
mr.
howard
boman
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
boman
correct,
he
is
not
a
party.
mr.
howard
boman
and
he
--
there's
no
appearance
made
for
the
county
superintendent.
mr.
howard
boman
yes.
mr.
howard
boman
well,
i
think,
sir,
the
decisions
of
this
court,
in
certainly
differing
circumstances,
have
held
at
a
number
of
times.
mr.
howard
boman
i'm
talking
about
the
cases
where
the
court
--
this
court
has
held
that
there
should
be
resort
to
administrative
remedies.
mr.
howard
boman
yes.
mr.
howard
boman
yes.
mr.
howard
boman
it
must
be
alluded
in
a
matter
of
committee
between
the
national
and
state
governments.
that
seems
to
be
the
ex
--
those
are
the
expressions
one
finds
in
the
circuit
cases,
that
it
is
on
deference
to
that
committee.
it
is,
as
a
matter
of
committee,
deference
to
sovereignty
of
those
states,
and
particularly,
when
one
deals
with
the
educational
program
which
is
an
operation
of
the
state
government
itself,
as
--
i
think
it's
an
engrafted
type
thing
on
the
law.
i
don't
know
any
other
source
of
it.
mr.
howard
boman
of
course,
in
monroe
v.
pape,
the
court
said
you
can't
proceed
at
all
against
the
city
of
chicago.
mr.
howard
boman
they
were
individuals,
yes,
sir.
and,
as
to
them,
the
court
said,
“you
can
proceed
here
and
you
don't
need
to
use
the
illinois
courts.”
of
course,
that
would
be
a
judicial
type
remedy.
i
would
think,
sir,
that
in
the
case
of
the
superintendent,
the
local
superintendent
here,
you
have
perhaps
a
different
situation
than
that,
quite
a
different
situation
than
you
have
with
a
municipality.
what
were
his
duties
under
the
civil
rights
act
and
isn't
he
one
of
the
persons
spoken
of
in
1983?
i
say
that
that
matter
was
--
has
not
been
litigated.
there's
nothing
at
all
that
comes
to
this
court
to
review
really,
and
that
aspect
has
just
been
ignored.
there
are,
of
course,
very
strong
policy
considerations
that
the
court
would
desire
to
weigh,
it
strikes
me,
before
the
court
would
not
require
a
resort
to
state
administrative
remedies
because
the
practical
matter
is,
and
this
is
i
think
not
merely
conjuring
up
these
evils
that
lawyers
can
do
so
readily,
but
it
really
opens
this
type
of
suit
to
where
the
line
between
this
district
and
that
district
should
be,
whether
it
should
be
on
this
side
of
elm
street
or
on
the
north
side,
counting
heads,
looking
at
complexions,
all
of
those
different
things
are
the
type
of
thing
that
is
suggested
by
the
plaintiffs,
and
they
want
--
the
petitioners,
and
they
want
the
federal
judge
to
do
that.
and
that
strikes
me
as
a
very,
very
great
burden
and
we
cite
the
experience
of
judge
kaufman
in
the
new
rochelle
case
and,
after
he
went
through
one
of
those
cases
said
in
the
opinion
that
litigation
is
an
unsatisfactory
way
to
resolve
questions
of
this
type.
that,
in
the
course
of
going
through
it,
the
attitudes
of
both
sides
become
hardened
and
it
makes
the
operation
of
the
schools,
apparently
his
ideas,
that
much
difficult
afterwards.
well,
i
think
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
this
first
court
has
had
a
lot
of
experience
in
enforcing
its
decrees
and
it's
been
through
everything
i
suppose.
it
could
come
possibly,
but
when
one
gets
down
into
the
details
where
the
line
should
be
in
the
cahokia,
illinois
school
system,
for
instance,
it
strikes
me
that
where
the
state
of
illinois
says,
“here
is
a
way,
if
somebody
thinks
that
these
lines
are
not
in
the
right
place,
a
way
to
determine
whether
they're
right
or
whether
they're
wrong
that
that
would
be
for
the
best
interests
of
everyone.”
mr.
howard
boman
i'm
suggesting,
sir,
that
it
would
be
a
hearing
officer
of
the
superintendent
administratively
to
do
it.
mr.
howard
boman
i
don't
think
he
would,
sir.
if
he
finds
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
law,
he
can
act.
he
can
withdraw
the
certification
of
the
schools
or
he
can
stop
their
money,
just
like
that.
mr.
howard
boman
if
he
use
that
means,
yes.
but,
if
he
used
the
means
in
his
own
office,
he
wouldn't
do
that.
he
--
mr.
howard
boman
no,
except
that,
of
course,
there
wouldn't
be
anything
to
compel
a
federal
judge
to
follow
the
law
either.
i
think
one
has
to
believe
that
these
men,
unless
there
is
something
to
the
contrary
that
appears,
will
follow
their
oaths.
and
the
state
superintendent
has
sworn
to
carry
out
the
law
and
i
can't
concede
that
he
would,
as
i
say,
make
a
finding
of
segregation
and
okay
their
money
at
the
same
time
when
the
law
forbad
a
school
district
which
practice
segregation
to
have
any
mo
--
fed
--
any
state
money
whatsoever.
i
think,
at
that
point,
he
would
deny
--
if
he
made
that
formal
finding,
he'd
deny
the
money,
he'd
lift
the
certificate
of
that
school
district,
and
that'd
be
the
end
of
that.
mr.
howard
boman
i
think
they
could
litigate
the
correctness
of
the
finding,
yes.
yes,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
would
prevent
them
meanwhile
from
being
denied
funds
or
being
denied
a
certificate.
i
think
that
he
would
effectively
stop
the
practice
right
there.
mr.
howard
boman
i
suppose
--
mr.
howard
boman
as
i
can't
answer
for
him,
i
never
talked
to
the
man,
but
he's
not
a
party
here,
you
understand?
mr.
howard
boman
and
what
he
knows
about
this
case
would
be
something
he'd
be
told
on
site.
i
wouldn't
assume
that
he
would
think
that,
well,
this
is
a
test
case
by
these
petitioners
that
want
to
point
rule
on.
i
supposed
that's
the
attitude
he'd
take.
i
don't
know.
i
don't
--
suppose
he'd
see
any
merit
in
it,
on
the
facts,
or
he
would've
done
so.
the
--
as
i
say,
if
the
court
please,
the
--
what
the
case
is
really
not,
as
i
conceive
it
here
and
it's
been
argued
in
the
district
court
and
appellate
court,
not
individual
pupils
complaining
that
they
were
denied
a
transfer
to
such
and
such
a
school.
there
never
was
a
transfer
request.
in
fact,
there's
been
no
negotiation
of
any
kind
in
this
matter.
the
first
thing
is
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
there's
no
antecedence
to
that
at
all.
it's
alleged,
but
that
isn't
the
fact,
and
immediately
taken
in
the
district
court
and
this
litigation
started.
that's
all
there's
been
to
it.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
boman
this
is
simply,
as
i
understand
the
law
and
the
pleadings,
an
admission
for
the
purpose
of
the
motion
and
one
doesn't
swallow
these
things
for
any
other
purpose.
so
--
mr.
howard
boman
yes,
sir,
and
the
law,
as
i
understood
it
at
that
time
and
as
the
seventh
circuit
held
it
to
be,
was
that,
as
a
prerequisite
to
that
type
of
action
in
the
district
court,
there
was
a
resort
to
the
state
administrative
remedy
as
a
prerequisite.
so,
that's
why
the
point
was
raised
there.
that
was
the
holding
in
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
howard
boman
it
--
mr.
howard
boman
sir,
it's
the
law,
as
i
understood
it
to
be,
and
the
fact
is,
i
mean,
if
somebody
want
to
talk
about
these
things
--
mr.
howard
boman
the
petitioners
--
mr.
howard
boman
the
petitioners
never
even
spoke
of
it
or
wrote
a
letter
to
the
board.
mr.
howard
boman
sir
--
mr.
howard
boman
--
could
i
make
one
point?
mr.
howard
boman
in
the
indulgence
of
the
court,
in
response
to
the
question
over
here,
it
comes
back
to
me.
the
first
complaint
was
accompanied
by
petition
for
a
temporary
injunction.
and
i
filed
the
motion
against
the
petition
for
a
temporary
injunction
as
well
as
for
the
preliminary
injunction.
the
matter
was
then
continued
for
hearing
on
the
temporary
injunction,
and
the
morning
it
was
to
be
heard,
they
brought
in
an
amended
complaint,
knocking
out
the
petition
for
temporary
injunction.
and,
rather
than
to
ask
for
any
time,
i
extended
the
motion
to
dismiss
to
the
amended
complaint.
i
didn't
recall
those
things,
but
that
was
the
setting
in
which
that
type
of
motion
was
filed
and
i
think
there
was
more
urgency
and
perhaps
this
motion
had
more
point.
then,
the
school
board
was
faced
with
a
hearing
to
cut
off
their
funds,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing,
that
very
morning.
so,
that
was
the
setting
in
which
that
was
filed.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
howard
boman
i
don't
quite
follow
mr.
harth.
my
position
is
that
the
superintendent,
of
course,
is
required
to
certify
claims
for
state
aid
to
the
dispersing
officer.
now,
the
same
superintendent
is
the
man
who
may
make
a
finding
that
there
was
discrimination
here.
now,
i'm
saying
that
it
passes
understanding
that,
one
day,
he
will
find
that
there
is
discrimination
in
the
cahokia
school
district,
and
the
second
day,
he
will
sign
his
name
to
a
certification
--
as
a
certification
to
a
claim
where
the
school
district
was
not
segregating.
mr.
howard
boman
well,
mr.
howard
boman
i
don't
think
it
says
either
way.
it
does
not
literally
say
that
he
may
review
or
not
review
the
affidavits.
mr.
howard
boman
yes,
sir.
i
think
he'd
fly
in
the
face
of
state
policy
if
he
wore
two
hats
in
the
same
matter.
mr.
howard
boman
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
boman
thank
you.
