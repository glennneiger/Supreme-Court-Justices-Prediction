justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
chenot?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
where
is
the
community
in
rel
--
in
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
see
if
i
understand
your
position,
mr.
harth.
is
it
that
this
is
an
action
under
the
civil
rights
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
alleges
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights
primarily
separation
by
races
requiring
individual
en
--
or
separate
entrances
and
exits.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
therefore
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
and
therefore
that
you're
not
required,
in
the
context
of
those
allegations,
to
invoke
any
state
remedies
of
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
even
though
the
action
was
a
civil
rights
action
and
(inaudible)
nevertheless,
it's
much
(inaudible)
even
though
the
action
was
a
civil
rights
action.
maybe
it
was
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
point
here
is
you
don't
have
to
get
administrative
state
remedy,
no
matter
what
it
could
be.
you're
just
seeking
a
remedy,
that's
all,
under
civil
rights.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
answer
is
that
you
have
the
contention
of
declaratory
relief
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
not
damages
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
therefore,
you
(inaudible)
monroe
versus
pape
apply.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
are
the
distinctions,
mr.
harth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
distinction,
mr.
harth,
is
that
the
damages
under
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
we
prove
it
then
as
a
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it's
not
about
the
statute.
he
might
have
taken
this
in
a
way
of
a
petition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
mr.
reiter,
i
must
say
i
have
difficulty
understanding.
if
the
school
board
was
anxious
to
have
this
thing
resolved
in
the
manner
that
they
feel
it
might
best
be
resolved
administratively
when
this
action
was
brought
against
them,
why
was
not
the
power
of
the
state
superintendent
invoked
and
then,
reference
or,
rather,
representation
made
to
the
--
judge
juergens
that
“the
state
superintendent
has
got
a
hold
of
this
thing
and
we
think
that's
where
it
ought
to
be
handled
and
hold
this
thing
for
awhile,”
why
wasn't
that
done?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
my
brother
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
douglas
says,
that
sounds
just
like
lawyer
strategy.
if,
actually,
you
are
willing
to
have
this
thing
explored,
as
i
understand
mr.
reiter
is
telling
us,
was
the
desire
of
the
school
board,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
easiest
way
in
the
world
for
the
school
board
to
have
that
desire
realized
would
have
been
to
ask
the
state
superintendent
to
do
something
about
it.
as
i
understand
it,
you're
telling
us
that
the
state
of
illinois
has
an
ideal
system.
you
have
state
laws
which
ban
this
kind
of
thing,
state
laws
which
could
do
the
obligation
of
the
superintendent
of
the
schools
to
--
state
superintendent,
rather,
to
enforce
and
respect
and
honor
and
see
to
it
that
the
school
board
did
it.
i
don't
follow
why
lawyers
should
adopt
a
kind
of
strategy
which
ultimately
gets
you
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
sometimes
law
and
action
is
a
lot
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
a
lot
better
than
law
enforced,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
federal
district
courts
have
been
doing
this
in
many,
many
situations.
