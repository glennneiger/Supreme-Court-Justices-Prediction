justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
said
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
were
saying
that
they
do
not
have
the
right
whatever
may
be
the
right
to
try
him
for
the
selling
of
books
that
prove
it's
obscene
that
at
the
trial
be
conducted
according
to
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
could
probably
be
illustrated
for
taking
the
extreme
case.
many
people
think
that
there
are
many
parts
of
the
bible
that
are
obscene
and
i
assume
that
no
one
would
defend
the
statute
that
you
gave
us
for
the
right
to
notify
books
of
it,
couldn't
sell
the
bible
because
of
these
obscene
parts.
what's
to
keep
your
board
from
doing
this
if
it
wanted
to?
i'm
sure
it
wouldn't
but
suppose
it
wanted
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
are
some
parts
of
â€˜the
autobiography
of
benjamin
franklin'
that
is
said
to
be
obscene.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
read
those
and
decide,
they
didn't
want
that
said
book.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you'd
say
they
couldn't
prosecute
him
and
tried
him
for
it,
on
the
ground
that
it
is
obscenity.
you
wouldn't
say
they
could
convict
him
or
not
convict
him
but
you'd
say
they
could
be
prosecuted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
drawing
a
distinction
between
the
prosecution
and
the
preparation
of
list
to
notify
people
that
they
can't
sell
those
particular
things
because
that
board
thinks
they
are
obscene.
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
place
further
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there's
one
play
of
where
they
have
said
you
reported
to
the
chiefs
of
police.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
chiefs
of
police
is
originally
active
in
some
cases
in
some
type
of
things.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
it
all.
suppose
they
just
read
the
book
and
they
decided
it's
obscene
and
went
to
somebody,
over
to
the
district
attorney
and
accomplish
with
--
this
supposed
to
be
obscene,
they
went
through
and
pointed
out
that
that
is
obscene
you
went
on
and
prosecute
them,
would
there
be
any
violation
of
the
constitution
(voice
overlap)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
your
answer
to
that
would
be
that's
not
state
action.
that's
not
governmental
action
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
citizens
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
mean
that
board
rule
goes
in
there
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
either
the
government,
the
district
attorney
or
whether
the
board,
if
they
discuss
it
without
saying
that
we
want
you
to
prosecute.
the
district
attorney
tells
him
come
back
three
or
four
days
later
regarded
it
as
obscene
and
have
not
instituted
prosecution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
with
the
constitutionality
of
the
statement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suggest
that
you
might
find
everything
reading
in
the
debate
that
appears
in
the
senate
some
years
ago,
with
reference
with
to
the
amendment
by
senator
cutting
to
the
tariff
bill
in
which
it
was
finally
settled
on
the
basis
that
they
could
do
it,
let's
find
out
what
was
obscene
by
having
trials
in
court,
where
a
jury
trial
was
granted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
simply
calling
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
as
i
understand
it,
basically,
you're
raising
the
question
whether
the
state
can
create
agencies
which
shortcuts
or
bypass
to
put
up
our
obstacles
or
hurdles
to
the
constitutional
right
to
a
trial
before
a
man
who
is
harassed
or
pressured
by
governmental
agencies
into
suppressing
certain
books.
that
was
the
basis
of
the
debate
which
took
place
in
that
--
and
that
with
reference
to
that
territory.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
that
that
was
bad,
objectionable
legally
for
prosecuting
attorney
to
threaten
prosecution
but
it's
not
bad
for
the
state
to
set
up
a
board
which
is
not
a
part
of
the
court
to
go
over
the
books
and
send
that
lists
for
the
prosecuting
officer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
distinguish
those
two?
it
may
be
that
there
is
a
ground
or
there's
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
think
it
was
part
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
that's
frequently
done
in
states
by
prosecutors
with
reference
to
different
charges
or
offenses
sometimes
for
them
having
passed
on
it.
he
says,
i
will
consider
this
defense
and
prosecute
it.
do
you
think
that
your
board
stands
on
precisely
the
same
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
mean
it
had
no
power
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
actually
to
initiate
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
convict
people
and
stop
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
practically
speaking,
you'd
assume
you
would
agree
that
it
would
have
been
creative
except
for
the
belief
that
it
would
have
considerable
power
to
keep
booksellers
from
selling
certain
books
honestly
deemed
against
the
public
welfare.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
agency
for
that
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
there's
no
teeth
insofar
as
they're
being
able
to
start
prosecutions
in
the
court
of
their
own
motion?
that's
what
you
mean
by
no
teeth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
does
have
the
teeth,
it
will
be
given
to
anything
of
that
kind
when
the
state
puts
it
prestige
in
power
and
money
behind
an
agency
which
wants
to
--
certain
views
to
prevail
here
to
use
with
reference
to
certain
books.
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
say?
i
didn't
quite
understand
what
you
said
about
it.
what
did
you
stated?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
said
(voice
overlap).
what
did
you
--
did
you
express
a
view
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
misunderstood
you.
i
just
thought
you
said,
suppose
you
would.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
stating
what
you
understand
to
be
the
real
objective
of
the
commission?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
explaining
to
me
now
what
you
mean
by
educating
the
public
of
rhode
island?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
just
an
ordinarily
language
what
is
its
objective?
why
did
they
want
to
do
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
did
they
want
to
do
this
in
your
words?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
hope
to
be
accomplished
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
cooperate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we'll
not
sell
those
books
that
had
come
to
--
that
had
met
the
display
of
the
commission,
isn't
it?
that's
what
you
mean
by
cooperation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
what's
the
difference
in
that
expression
which
has
recently
come
into
both
of
exposure
for
exposure's
sake
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
what
is
the
object
of
what
the
commission
does
except
to
expose
for
exposure
sake,
meaning
to
expose
in
order
that
the
people
will
not
sell
these
books,
that
the
distributors
will
refuse
to
sell
these
books
which
have
met
indiscretion
of
the
commission.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
object
that
by
publishing
it
and
looking
into
them
and
sending
the
reports
that
will
keep
the
booksellers
from
selling
the
books
that
have
met
the
displeasure
of
the
state
commission.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
whatever
is
done,
i
believe
that
all
words
do
not
fit.
what
i
want
to
find
out
here
if
the
object
and
purpose
of
this
commission,
you
are
certainly
familiar
with
it,
is
i'm
not
saying
it's
wrong
or
that
it's
unconstitutional.
but
if
there
are
written
purposes
by
getting
these
lists
of
books
and
giving
such
publicity
to
them
as
they
do
give,
whatever
that
is,
is
not
his
or
is
not
with
the
hope
and
the
object
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
preventing
the
sale
of
those
books
and
these
large
numbers
of
them
in
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
there
any
other
purpose
except
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
directory
have
those
read
they
want
read,
they
think
should
be
read,
and
those
not
read
they
think
should
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
of
course
could
be
done
with
reference
to
political
books,
couldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose,
probably
they
wouldn't
do
it
but
suppose
the
same
board
as
to
your
argument,
in
fact
there
has
no
--
there's
nothing
to
do
that's
been
constitutionally,
suppose
it
puts
out
a
list
of
those
books
that
it
thought
the
most
desirable
at
the
state's
expense
to
be
read
and
divided
them
according
to
parties
and
they
would
want
a
party
over
the
other,
books
of
one
party
over
the
other.
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it's
not
a
state
activity
intended
to
reduce
in
some
way
the
opportunity
to
read
certain
types
of
literature,
then
it
wouldn't
violate
the
law
from
the
dividing
up
according
to
political
basis,
would
it,
or
religious?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
of
course
wouldn't
say
they
could
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
state
legislature
were
to
pass
a
bill
which
put
these
particular
books
on
the
list,
they
were
to
be
published,
that
list
were
to
be
published
in
showing
the
public
that
the
offenses
in
violation
of
the
law,
could
the
legislature
pass
that
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
pretty
close
to
the
bill
of
attainder
in
some
aspects.
