how
can
there
be
convictions
if
they
have
acquittals
without
injunctions?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
when
did
you
interpret
the
commission's
notices
to
the
request
to
remove
these
publications
completely
from
circulation
or
only
from
distribution
to
the
minors?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
yet
do
all
of
the
notices
speak
in
terms
as
i
see
them
in
the
record
being
objectionable
for
sale,
distribution
or
display
for
youth
under
18
years
of
age,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
would
scarcely
regard
the
books
and
magazines
listed,
the
examples
in
good
literature,
would
you?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
wouldn't
that
be
a
good
characterization
of
most
of
the
books
and
magazines
that
were
listed?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
been
with
your
argument,
if
you
will
turn
to
the
resolution
creating
the
commission
on
page
81
is
--
then
look
at
the
last
paragraph
describing
the
duties
of
the
commission,
is
it
the
nub
of
your
argument
that
the
vice
of
this
statute
is
the
power
to
recommend?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
where
is
it?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
would
you
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
surely.
now,
would
the
--
is
it
the
nub
of
your
argument
that
(c)
recommend
legislation
prosecution
is
the
vice
of
this
statute
or
would
your
argument
has
the
same
force
it
confined
to
the
first
part
stating
the
duty
of
the
commission
to
educate
the
public
concerning
books,
et
cetera
at
obscenity.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
don't
equate
the
power
to
recommend
prosecution
of
an
average
citizen
to
a
state
body
set
up
by
law,
do
you?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
there
was
a
difference,
there's
a
vital
difference
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
would
your
argument
reach
to
the
point
that
a
state
educational
agency,
say
council
of
higher
education
of
the
state
could
not
distribute
literature
pointing
out
what
was
junk
and
what
is
good
literature?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
does
the
college
teacher
do
this
when
he
talks
to
the
class
that
he
says
that
this
stuff
isn't
worth
reading
and
this
stuff
is
good
literature?
