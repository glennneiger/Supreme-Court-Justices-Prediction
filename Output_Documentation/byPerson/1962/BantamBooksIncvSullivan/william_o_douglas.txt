o.
douglas
there's
no
criminal
prosecution?
justice
william
o.
douglas
they
never
had
strategy?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
the
commission
authorized
to
send
notices
to
the
police?
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
many
--
how
many
--
how
many
prosecutions
have
there
been
preparedly
to
comply
with
the
request
of
the
commission?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
know
what
you're
saying
in
your
brief
the
fact
that
the
distributor
exceeded
to
the
suggestion
of
the
commission
to
get
that
the
distributor
also
agreed
that
the
books
were
obscene.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
was
just
--
i
was
quoting
your
brief.
justice
william
o.
douglas
a
very
reasonable
inference
you
say
to
be
drawn
from
silverstein
withdrawal
is
the
silverstein
realizing
that
the
books
were
objectionable.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
why
would
a
--
what
differences
will
it
make
whether
they're
objectionable
or
not
if
they
weren't
obscene
or
indecent?
justice
william
o.
douglas
who
won
that
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
maybe
this
was
being
enforced
against
the
books
that
were
not
obscene.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
gather
that
the
commission
acts
sometimes
by
divided
vote.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
that
might
be
--
maybe
three
or
two.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
wonder
how
you
can
possibly
consider
obscene
a
book
that
by
distinguish
citizens
of
rhode
island
like
before
this
commission
disagree
it
for.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
see
the
commission
has
been
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
proposing
to
distributors
that
the
commission
read
all
the
magazines
if
they
get
the
distributors
while
they're
distributed.
is
that
policy
being
carried
into
effect?
justice
william
o.
douglas
no,
the
commission
wanted
--
i
see
on
page
110,
the
commission
wanted
to
read
the
magazines
before
the
distributors
distributed
them.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that'd
be
more
effective
with
it,
wouldn't
it?
