mr.
horace
s.
manges
mr.
chief
justice,
all
the
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
superior
court
of
rhode
island.
before
appellants,
bantam
books,
dell
publishing
company,
pocket
books
and
the
new
american
library
of
world
literature
are
publishers
of
paper
bound
books
distributed
in
that
state.
the
appellees
are
the
members
and
the
executive
secretary
of
the
rhode
island
commission
to
encourage
morality
and
youth.
this
appeal
raises
two
basic
questions.
first,
does
rhode
island
resolution
number
73
which
created
this
commission
tend
to
suppress
or
inhibit
the
circulation
of
books
in
violation
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments?
secondly,
did
the
commission's
actions
in
sending
notices
to
book
sellers
and
police
chiefs
throughout
the
state
of
rhode
island
stating
that,
“particular
publications
were
objectionable
for
a
sale
or
display
to
youth
tend
to
suppress
or
inhibit
the
circulation
of
those
books
and
did
those
actions
actually
suppress
or
inhibit
the
circulation
of
those
books
again
in
violation
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments”.
rhode
island
resolution
73
was
enacted
in
1956,
its
operative
provision
as
amended
in
1959
insofar
as
pertinent
here
reads
as
follows
and
i
read
from
page
2
of
the
record,
“it
shall
be
the
duty
of
said
commission
to
educate
the
public
concerning
any
book,
etcetera,
containing
obscene,
indecent,
or
impure
language
as
defined
in
chapter
11-31
of
the
general
laws
entitled
obscene
and
objectionable
publications
and
shows
and
to
investigate
and
recommend
the
prosecution
of
all
violations
of
said
sections”.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
yes.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
yes.
they
deal
not
only
with
minors
but
also
adults
and
they
also
deal
with
in
rem
proceedings
which
may
be
brought
in
connection
with
allegedly
obscene
literature.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
both
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
1960,
these
plaintiffs
instituted
this
action
in
the
superior
court.
the
case
was
tried
before
justice
mackenzie
and
a
decree
was
there
added,
adjudging
one
that
the
resolution
was
constitutional.
secondly,
that
the
commission's
actions
were
unconstitutional
and
the
court
issued
an
injunction
enjoining
the
commission
from
the
continuance
of
those
acts.
both
sides
appealed
the
rhode
island
supreme
court.
the
appellants
from
that
portion
of
the
decree
which
upheld
constitutionality
of
the
resolution
the
appellees
from
the
rest.
that
court
by
its
majority
opinion
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
both
the
resolution
and
the
commission's
actions.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
mr.
chief
justice
and
other
members
of
the
court.
the
rhode
island
supreme
court
in
sustaining
constitutionality
of
both
the
resolution
and
of
the
commission's
actions
in
sending
out
its
notices
remanded
the
case
to
the
superior
court
for
the
entry
of
a
final
decree
in
conformity
with
its
majority
opinion.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
undisputed
and
they
are
as
follows.
between
july
1957,
which
was
shortly
after
this
commission
began
to
function,
and
early
1960
when
this
action
was
started,
the
commission
sent
out
to
booksellers
throughout
the
state
of
rhode
island
and
also
to
sellers
of
magazines,
at
least
35
separate
notices,
each
listing
books
and
magazines
which
the
commission
had
found
objectionable
for
sale
or
youth
--
or
display
to
youth
under
18.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
yes,
your
honor.
that's
it.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
the
statute
creating
the
commission.
it's
the
commission
to
encourage
the
morality
in
youth,
but
that
to
recommend
prosecution
of
all
the
state
obscenity
laws
including
those
which
apply
to
it
--
to
adults.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
yes
sir.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
the
public.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
that's
right.
by
early
1960,
the
commission
admitted
that
it
had
found
108
books
and
magazines
thus
objectionable.
one
of
the
recipients
of
these
notices
was
the
firm
of
max
silverstein
and
sons
of
providence
which
was
the
exclusive
wholesale
distributor
of
appellant's
books
for
70%
to
75%
of
the
state
of
rhode
island
including
all
of
the
city
of
providence.
the
first
notice
that
the
silverstein
firm
received
was
dated
july
19,
1957.
it
appears
at
page
55
of
the
record
and
as
you
will
note
is
on
the
official
letterhead
of
the
commission
as
were
all
the
other
notices.
it
contains
several
significant
statements
and
i
should
like
to
read
some
of
them.
this
agency
was
established
by
a
legislative
order
in
1956
with
the
immediate
charge
to
prevent
the
sale,
distribution
or
display
of
indecent
and
obscene
publications
to
youths
under
18
years
of
age.
“the
commissioners
have
reviewed
the
following
publications
and
by
majority
vote,
had
declared
that
they
are
completely
objectionable
for
sale,
distribution
or
display
for
youth
under
18,”
then
those
three
magazines,
and
then
it
goes
on,
“the
chiefs
of
police
have
been
given
the
names
of
the
aforesaid
magazines
with
the
order
that
they
are
not
to
be
sold,
distributed
or
displayed
to
youths
under
18
years
of
age.
the
attorney
general
will
act
for
us
in
case
of
non-compliance.
the
commissioners
trust
that
you
will
cooperate
with
this
agency
in
their
work.”
and
then
the
notice
ends,
“thanking
you
for
your
anticipated
cooperation”.
a
further
commission
threat
to
recommend
prosecution
to
the
attorney
general
is
contained
in
another
commission
notice
being
petitioners'
exhibit
11,
we
being
the
petitioners
down
below.
that
exhibit
appears
at
page
76
of
the
record
and
i
should
like
to
read
the
last
two
sentences.
“your
cooperation
in
removing
the
listed
and
other
objectionable
publications
from
your
newsstands
will
be
appreciated.
cooperative
action
will
eliminate
the
necessity
of
our
recommending
prosecution
to
the
attorney
general's
department.”
this
coupling
by
the
commission
of
the
word
“cooperation”
along
with
the
mention
of
attorney
general's
action
makes
it
quite
clear
that
when
this
commission
used
the
term
“cooperation”
in
these
two
notices
and
the
other
33
notices
it
meant
to
convey
to
booksellers
a
message.
“you
either
take
these
books
and
magazines
off
sale
or
else
we're
going
to
see
to
it
that
you'll
be
recommended
for
prosecution.”
now,
to
make
--
to
make
certain
that
this
message
would
register
with
the
booksellers,
the
commission
notified
them
that
they
were
sending
copies
of
all
these
notices
to
the
chiefs
of
police
throughout
rhode
island
and
the
copies
were
so
found.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
well,
there
is
one
statement
in
the
commission's
annual
report
of
1960
that
on
seven
cases
that
was
cited
by
way
of
their
injunction
that
there
were
three
convictions
and
that
there
were
three
acquittals.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
injunction
--
adjudication
(inaudible)
the
way
of
the
commission's
report.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
yes
sir,
there's
one
--
there's
one
criminal
prosecution
where
the
defendant
in
connection
have
taken
place.
the
jury
convicted
and
had
the
verdict
set
aside
on
the
ground
that
one
of
the
jurors
was
just
to
be
related
to
the
chief
complaining
witness.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
no.
and
about
two
years
have
gone
by
since
--
since
that.
but
the
commission
was
not
satisfied
with
sending
these
copies
to
the
police
chiefs.
in
every
case,
they
followed
up
with
a
questionnaire
to
the
police.
on
this
subject,
the
appellee
mccallum,
the
executive
secretary
of
the
commission
testified
and
i
quote
from
page
45
of
the
record,
i
asked
him
the
question,
“will
you
tell
us
what
do
these
questionnaires
that
are
referred
to
in
the
minutes?”
mr.
mccallum
answered
me.
answer:
the
questionnaires
were
sent
to
the
various
chiefs
of
police
in
the
state
asking
them
of
why
they
had
followed
up
any
list
if
they
admit
any
cooperation
or
any
negative
action.
the
effect
of
this
--
of
these
methods
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
record
shows
that
within
10
days
after
everyone
of
these
commission
notices
were
sent
out,
the
firm
of
silverstein
received
an
inquiry
from
the
providence
police
department
asking
for
a
report
of
what
action
had
been
taken
with
the
respect
to
every
listed
publication.
a
police
officer
inquired
as
to
how
many
copies
of
the
publication
silverstein
originally
received,
how
many
he
had
tried
to
recall
from
its
customers,
how
many
it
had
shipped
back
to
the
publishers.
so
you
see
that
this
procedure
produced
the
desired
effect
of
frightening
all
of
the
sales,
books
that
had
been
listed
by
the
commission
as
objectionable.
thus,
the
record
shows
that
every
time
silverstein
received
a
list
of
publications,
it
took
off
sale
every
copy,
it
sent
out
its
field
man
to
its
retail
customers
and
recalled
every
copy,
and
then
it
took
all
the
unsold
copies
and
shipped
all
of
those
copies
back
to
the
publishers.
silverstein
took
this
action
as
its
manager
kaplan
testified.
and
i
quote
from
page
25
of
the
record
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
“rather
than
face
the
possibility
of
some
sort
of
a
court
action
against
ourselves
as
well
as
the
people
that
we
supply”.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
that's
at
the
bottom
of
page
25,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
i
--
i
treat
them,
mr.
justice
goldberg
as
a
request
to
take
them
off
sale
completely,
as
typified
by
the
exhibit
11
at
the
bottom
of
page
76
where
it
states
your
cooperation
in
removing
the
listed
another
quote,
“objectionable
publications
from
the
newsstands
will
be
appreciated
and
cooperative
action
will
indeed
eliminate
the
necessity
of
our
recommending
prosecution.”
mr.
horace
s.
manges
that's
correct.
but
also,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
these
notices
were
sent
to
all
the
wholesalers.
now,
the
wholesalers
weren't
selling
--
they
weren't
selling
to
those
under
18.
the
wholesalers
were
selling
it
to
retailers.
so
they're
obviously
trying
to
cut
off
at
the
source
of
supply.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
there
is
a
list
in
the
record
of
--
i
counted
106
of
the
108
books
and
magazines
that
had
been
found
objectionable
up
to
january
1960.
our
action
having
been
--
it
started
in
february
1960.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
106
of
them.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
they
are
mostly
--
there
are
more
magazines
than
books.
the
book
taken
place
published
by
one
of
our
appellants
was
on
the
list
and
by
grace
metalious
or
the
book
the
bramble
bush
by
charles
mergendahl
which
is
a
very
good
seller,
one
of
the
bestsellers
published
by
another
appellant,
dell,
was
also
on
the
list.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
i
wouldn't
stand
up
to
there
being
good
literature
but
i
don't
think
that
they're
obscene
and
i
think
they're
still
entitled
to
constitutional
protection
your
honor
even
if
they're
judged
as
obscene.
i
think
many
of
them
--
many
of
them
are
trashy
in
answer
to
your
question.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
i
would
say
many
of
them.
in
the
commission's
--
in
the
commission's
report
dated
january
1960,
it
referred
further
to
this
question
of
withdrawal
of
publications
and
it
began
to
do
a
little
bragging.
and
i'd
just
like
to
read
a
few
lines
from
the
report
of
the
commission
which
was
a
report
that
was
sent
annually
to
the
governor
of
rhode
island
and
to
the
legislature
that
this
particular
report
is
the
one
of
january,
1960
and
i
read
from
page
103
of
the
record.
this
is
below
the
middle
of
page,
after
the
commission
states
that
the
list
found
objectionable
is
now
brought
up
to
a
total
of
108
that
goes
on
to
say
regardless
requested
by
chiefs
of
police
distributors
and
educators
in
1957
of
the
type
of
publications
deemed
objectionable
for
youth
under
18
is
still
sent
to
all
local
distributors
and
chiefs
of
police
in
rhode
island
with
the
result
that
in
the
last
six
months
our
newsstands
so
at
very
improved
condition.
in
most
cases,
local
distributors
have
been
cooperative
this
year
withdrawing
publications
of
the
type
listed
in
the
commission
guide
list
and
returning
them
to
publishers.
this
commission
feels
that
the
guide
list
court
action
initiated
by
this
commission
and
the
cooperation
of
the
attorney
generals
department
is
largely
responsible
for
the
new
look,
and
i
turn
this
quote
on
rhode
island
these
days.
from
the
foregoing
statement
of
the
facts,
it
seems
clear
that
the
effect
of
this
resolution
and
of
the
commission's
actions
there
under,
has
had
the
effect,
then
to
suppress
the
circulation
of
books
and
magazines
in
rhode
island
without
any
prior
judicial
determination
that
they
are
obscene.
now,
it
is
true
under
the
holdings
of
this
court
that
obscene
publications
are
not
entitled
to
constitutional
protection.
it
is
equally
clear
as
stated
by
this
court
in
smith
against
california
that
no
state
has
the
power
to
restrict
the
dissemination
of
publications
that
are
not
obscene.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
i
read
--
mr.
horace
s.
manges
i
read
from
page
103
before,
mr.
justice
stewart,
on
the
commission's
annual
report.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
oh,
oh,
i
said
--
mr.
horace
s.
manges
this
is
my
statement.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
i'm
sorry.
i
said
of
that.
i
said
the
statement
that
i
was
ending
the
quotation.
i
said
from
my
foregoing
statement
of
facts,
i
meant
that
it
is
clear.
it
is
clear
that
there
has
been
effect
of
this
suppression
of
publications
in
rhode
island
without
the
prior
court
determination
that
they're
obscene.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
yes
and
professor
walter
gellhorn
who
--
i
think
who
wrote
the
book
on
the
other
side.
i'm
not
certain
to
how
much
--
how
much
of
the
activities
of
the
commission
were
presented
when
that
act
really
was
sought
and
granted
ex
parte.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
yes,
sir.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
yes.
yes,
it
is,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
yes.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
yes.
yes
to
appropriations.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
yes,
sir.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
that's
not
the
--
that's
not
the
amended
resolution,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
it
got
before
the
amendment
of
1959.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
the
amended
part
is
at
page
2
of
the
record
where
the
operative
position
--
operative
provision
was
amended.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
would
say
that
the
provision
for
recommending
the
prosecution
aggravates
the
situation
very
seriously
but
even
if
there
were
no
such
power
to
recommend
prosecution
because
that
evidence
can
really
recommend
prosecution
without
an
appropriation
to
order
that
effect.
the
general
impact
of
that
was
to
inhibit
the
circulation
of
books
because
none
of
these
--
this
was
not
a
nullity
in
meaning.
it's
supposed
to
be
a
purpose
in
having
this
resolution.
now,
the
average
bookseller
didn't
want
to
tangle
with
the
law
and
he
saw
how
that
if
he
didn't
comply
with
the
wish
of
the
commission,
he
would
be
getting
in
dot.
now,
he
had
to
bear
in
mind
that
they
were
recommending
prosecutions
not
only
with
respect
to
those
under
18
but
with
respect
to
those
over
18.
so
if
he
incurred
their
goodwill,
this
could
be
a
very
serious
limitation
on
his
career
and
it
would
seriously
intend
to
inhibit
what
he
would
be
willing
to
carry
in
stock.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
no.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
i
find
it
all
serious
and
i
think
the
rhode
island
legislature
so
in
candid
and
i
think
that's
one
of
the
reasons
they
put
this
in
to
frighten
and
it
did
have
that
effect
of
frightening.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
i
think
they
could
make
all
the
recommendations
in
the
world
about
books
generally.
like
when
they
come
down
to
adjudicate
educating
by
adjudicating
what
particular
books
are
obscene
or
not
obscene
that
there's
annual
serving
of
court
function.
and
i
don't
think
anybody
but
the
court
can
do
that.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
yes.
but
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
interest
of
threat
of
any
wielding
power.
there's
nothing
malice
about
that.
i
say
in
answer
to
the
first
part
of
your
question,
even
though
this
expressed
power
to
recommend
prosecution
hadn't
been
in
a
law,
there
would
be
impending
that
the
imply
--
the
implication
that
this
commission
had
power
to
wield
--
wield
something,
had
some
influence
over
these
people
and
that
they
would
thread
slowly
and
that
would
inhibit
the
circulation
of
literature.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
i
think
that
would
be
bad.
in
bantam
books
against
melko
which
i
argued
before
mr.
justice
brennan
in
new
jersey,
the
prosecutor
of
elizabeth
county
sent
out
notices
to
the
county
prosecutor.
“the
book
‘the
chinese
room'
is
obscene.
and
if
anybody
in
this
county
sell
‘the
chinese
room',
i'm
going
to
--
i'm
going
to
prosecute
him.”
now
we
contended
that
that
was
unconstitutional
because
if
a
prosecutor
wants
to
prosecute,
he
should
prosecute
but
he
shouldn't
threaten
by
saying
that
something
obscene
because
a
prosecutor
hasn't
have
the
right
to
determine
what's
obscene
or
has
the
legislature
nor
has
economical
legislature.
this
is
a
court
function
and
constitutional
privileges
should
not
be
taken
away
lightly.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
he
has,
your
honor,
but
if
the
prosecutor
says
to
a
man
that
he
sees
about
to
burn
down
a
building,
if
you
burn
down
that
building,
i'm
going
to
prosecute
you.
that's
something
objective.
he's
got
a
perfect
right
to
do
that.
but
if
a
man
says,
“i'm
going
to
take
away
your
rights
under
the
--
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
and
deprive
you
of
freedom
of
press,
if
you
publish
this
book,”
i
say
no,
that's
very
different.
as
this
court
has
said,
there's
a
difference
obtained
in
the
mind
and
the
belly.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
the
obscenity
statute
--
the
obscenity
statute
alone,
every
obscenity
statute
has
a
slight
inhibiting
influence.
as
your
honors
said
in
smith
against
california,
but
your
honors
also
said
when
you
dealt
with
the
question
of
scienter
that
that
is
a
different
problem,
it's
a
matter
of
degree.
the
existence
of
an
ordinary
criminal
actions,
tearing
of
books
in
the
face
has
a
slight
inhibiting
--
has
a
slight
inhibiting
effect.
yes,
but
that's
minimal.
but
he
doesn't
know
--
he
doesn't
know
whether
he's
going
to
be
convicted
of
prosecution
because
he
may
have
certain
defense.
scienter,
he
may
read
the
book
himself
and
if
he
reads
it
in
good
faith,
this
court
is
left
open
whether
he
may
have
a
good
defense.
but
if
he
has
the
threat
of
this
commission
telling
him
or
prosecuted
telling
him,
these
books
are
obscene.
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
this
restrain
is
much
greater.
so
i
say
in
each
case,
it's
the
question
of
degree
and
with
the
freedom
of
the
press
and
the
first
amendment
this
court
has
said
time
and
again
that
it
would
go
slow
in
depriving
people
of
their
constitutional
right.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
yes,
sir.
in
an
adversary
proceeding
with
due
process,
if
our
court
says
that
--
mr.
horace
s.
manges
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
have
anything
to
prevent
them
to
do
it
because
they
are
short
circuiting
their
courts,
they're
bypassing
the
courts,
and
there
you're
asserting
a
court
function.
and
they
are
depriving
any
administration
of
due
process
and
declaration
adjudication
of
obscenity.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
true.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
it's
subject
to
the
very
abusive
power
that
your
honor
described.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
well
you
say
--
mr.
horace
s.
manges
yes.
we
object
to
frightening
books
or
sales
so
the
courts
have
not
given
the
opportunity
of
making
the
adjudication
whether
a
publication
is
obscene
or
not.
if
the
publication
is
obscene,
after
a
fair
trial
in
the
courts,
then
we
say
the
publisher
must
abide
by
that.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
the
board,
mr.
justice
clark
said,
“your
removal
of
these
publications
from
the
newsstands
will
eliminate
the
necessity
of
our
putting
on
pressure,
and
going
to
the
attorney
general
and
see
to
it
that
we're
going
to
give
our
official
recommendation
and
you'll
be
prosecuted
as
putting
a
pretty
severe,
pretty
severe
pressure
on
the
average
of
bookseller.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
they
stand
up
to
it.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
they
said
that
in
--
they
said
in
--
mr.
horace
s.
manges
exactly,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
your
honor,
i
say
any
sellers
can
go
over
the
district
attorney
with
that
same
message
of
the
district
attorney
or
the
attorney
general
once
prosecuted
that
perfectly
follows.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
that's
right.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
that's
right.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
well,
i
--
mr.
horace
s.
manges
i
think
there's
nothing
wrong
about
that
if
it's
kept
secret,
if
it
--
mr.
horace
s.
manges
yes,
i
do.
i
do
with
the
type
of
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
i'll
come
into
that
for
another
reason
but
in
answer
to
your
question
if
the
statute
--
if
the
commission
have
been
constitutionally
created,
then
i
would
see
nothing
wrong
in
a
private
recommendation
to
a
prosecuting
officer
to
prosecute
because
that
would
not
have
inspired
fear
and
the
selling
would've
--
would
go
on,
we
assume
until
there's
an
adversary
proceeding
in
court
where
the
book
can
be
defended.
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
that.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
with
the
respect
to
first
amendment
matters,
i
would
say
yes
because
this
is
putting
undue
pressure
--
mr.
horace
s.
manges
not
of
the
bill
of
rights,
no.
but
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
speaking
for
the
court,
there's
a
difference
between
a
pure
food
and
drug
act
where
you
can
have
an
absolute
prohibition.
there's
a
difference
between
the
belly
and
the
mind
when
it
comes
to
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
press,
you
can't
deprive
people
--
you
shouldn't
deprive
people
of
constitutional
right
unless
there
has
been
an
adjudication
of
obscenity
without
putting
pressure
on
it.
now,
if
you
frighten
a
person
of
taking
the
books
off
sale,
if
the
prosecutor
--
if
the
district
attorney
says
this,
“you
better
read
this
or
else”,
that's
going
to
discourage
the
publication
of
literature.
we
say
there
should
be
absolutely
no
restraints
on
publications
until
somebody
starts
the
prosecution
and
tries
the
case
out
in
a
court
in
an
adversary
proceeding
whether
there
is
the
opportunity
to
defend.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
well,
mr.
justice
white,
there
have
been
--
there
are
many
of
these
injunctive
statutes
all
over
the
country
and
you
know
to
make
them
right
and
constitutional
and
to
give
them
the
opportunity
to
defend,
there
is
a
provision
that
one
of
these
proceedings
started,
there
is
an
opportunity
for
the
publisher
or
anybody
else
to
come
in
and
defend
even
though
the
bookseller
thinks
it's
too
expensive
or
for
any
other
reasons
decides
not
to
defend.
so
the
publisher
always
hears
about
this
and
he
would
just
come
in
to
defend
his
book.
in
that
way,
even
though
the
bookseller
doesn't
defend,
he
will,
if
everybody
deliberately
defrauds
and
i
see
no
reason
for
not
having
the
adjudication
of
obscenity.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
well
the
publisher
--
i've
never
had
published
the
defrauding.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
admitting?
rather.
but
if
--
if
the
--
and
i
think
the
proceeding,
several
proceedings
have
instituted
ordinarily
if
the
bookseller
defends,
the
publisher
is
in
there
with
him
defending
or
if
the
bookseller
says
it's
too
expensive
to
me,
but
then
publisher
will
defend.
and
the
court
has
a
chance
of
adjudicating.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
and
the
publisher.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
well,
there
are
--
mr.
justice
black,
there
are
trials,
jury
trials
provided
in
--
under
certain
statutes
now,
for
instance
in
new
york
city,
there's
a
provision
of
the
law
without
--
mr.
horace
s.
manges
i
see,
i've
already
finished
about
half
of
that
in
my
argument.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
well,
i
haven't
started
my
real
argument
at
all,
really.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
i
have
about
20
minutes.
mr.
horace
s.
manges
thank
you,
mr.
justice
warren.
i'm
saying
that
while
it
is
true
that
publications
that
are
obscene
are
not
entitled
to
constitutional
protection,
it
is
equally
true
as
stated
by
this
court
that
publications
that
no
state
has
the
power
to
restrict
the
dissemination
of
publications
that
are
not
obscene
at
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
publication
is
obscene
or
not
obscene,
involves
a
question
of
constitutional
judgment
as
was
stated
by
mr.
justice
harlan
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
alberts
against
california.
such
a
constitutional
judgment,
we
say,
can
be
made
only
by
a
court.
therefore,
until
a
court
decides
what
is
obscene,
we
just
don't
know
what
publications
ought
to
be
deprived
of
their
constitutional
protection.
if
the
effect
of
a
statute
is
to
coerce
the
suppression
of
publications
without
a
prior
court
determination,
we
have
no
assurance
whatever
that
such
suppression
would
be
confined
to
publications
that
ought
to
lose
their
constitutional
protection.
such
a
statute
would
have
a
tendency
to
inhibit
constitutionally
protected
expression.
that
was
just
the
kind
of
a
tendency
that
led
this
court
to
strike
down
the
ordinance
of
smith
against
california.
now,
i
say
this
resolution
73
has
this
very
tendency
because
it
confers
the
right
and
the
duty
on
the
commission
to
educate
the
public
as
to
any
publication
containing
obscene
or
other,
any
et
cetera
is
the
word.
now
any
book
here
plainly
means
specific
books
and
the
commission
has
construed
it
that
way.
any
education
of
the
public
as
to
what
specific
books
are
obscene
constitutes
and
implies
threat
on
prosecution
unless
the
sale
of
those
particular
books
is
stopped.
and
we
say
that
that's
what
exactly
what
the
rhode
island
legislature
intended.
now,
in
the
rhode
island
supreme
court,
the
rationale
of
the
court
was
mainly
that
there
is
no
power
here
to
order
prosecution.
we
say
that
power
or
lack
of
power
is
not
the
determining
factor
what
is
fundamental
and
what
is
inescapable
here
that
this
resolution
which
includes
that
confers
on
an
official
body
that
threat
to
recommend
prosecution
has
had
the
effect
of
inhibiting
the
circulation
of
books
in
rhode
island
without
the
prior
court
determination.
it
gives
some
other
reasons
but
they're
dealt
with
it
in
the
brief.
now,
i
say
to
inject
--
they
said
let
us
all
do
the
voluntary
cooperation
and
the
record
is
absolutely
the
contrary.
and
we
say
that
to
argue
that
this
case
involves
voluntary
cooperation
is
just
engaging
in
semantics
and
nothing
else.
these
were
threats
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
and
the
result
is
you
got
108
--
108
publications
taken
off
sale
during
that
period.
and
we
don't
know
which
one
of
them
should
have
lost
their
constitutional
guarantees.
and
if
this
kind
of
procedure
is
allowed
to
go
on,
we
don't
know
how
many
of
the
other
states
will
encourage
this
and
you
have
your
adult
population
also
deprived
of
what
the
commission
was
talking
about
should
not
be
published
for
those
under
18.
we
say
that
both
the
resolution
on
its
face
is
unconstitutional
because
you
can't
have
--
constitutionally
have
a
non-court
educate
the
public
as
to
specific
books.
and
two,
that
the
actions
of
the
commission
are
unconstitutional.
we
ask
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
thank
you.
