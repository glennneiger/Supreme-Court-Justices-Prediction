justice
john
m.
harlan
was
the
statute
is
limited
to
youth?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
it's
more
general.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
excluding
those
for
adults.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
question
i
want
to
ask
you
was,
is
there
any
record
of
the
prosecution
that
had
been
brought
in
rhode
island
pursuant
to
recommendation
of
the
commission?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
that
please?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
such
a
thing
such
a
thing
as
a
list
of
the
books
that
the
commission
has
found
objectionable
since
its
inception?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
are
the
names
of
the
publications
or
books
given
in
that
list?
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
the
names
of
each
of
the
publications?
justice
john
m.
harlan
read
the
last
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court
said
that
the
effect
of
this
was
to
suppress
these
publications.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
prosecutor
has
got
that
authority
to
institute
a
prosecution
with
or
without
notice.
justice
john
m.
harlan
given
the
constitutionality
of
the
obscenity
statute,
what
is
the
difference?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
you
have
a
high-minded
district
attorney
who
says
that
these
obscenity
laws
are
illusory
things
and
he's
not
going
to
prosecute
without
giving
a
publisher
a
chance
both
to
read
the
book
if
he's
a
large
publisher
and
he
doesn't
read
every
book
on
the
bookshelves
or
give
him
a
chance
to
make
his
own
decision
as
to
whether
he's
going
to
run
the
risk
of
prosecution
or
not
and
he
does
that
universally
in
all
cases
under
the
obscenity
statute.
could
he
be
enjoined
from
doing
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
the
first
amendment
stands
on
some
different
basis
in
any
other
so
--
in
any
other
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
find
yourself
as
attorney
general
having
to
do
a
lot
of
outside
reading
as
a
result
of
this
commission?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
requires
you
as
attorney
general
to
institute
or
refuse
to
institute
prosecution.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
institute
a
jury,
you're
not
bound
by
the
action
of
the
commission.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
nothing
new
in
this
court,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
nothing
new
around
here,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
does
lady
chatterley's
lover
stand
in
rhode
island?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
that
your
case
would
be
different
in
view
for
one
way
or
the
other
if
practice
of
this
commission
had
been
limited
to
simply
giving
the
district
attorney
or
the
attorney
general
its
views
of
the
books
on
which
they
thought
prosecution
ought
to
be
instituted
without
sending
these
broadcast
notices
to
the
police?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
is
that?
what's
the
purpose
of
sending
them?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
want
to
keep
obscene
literature
off
the
stands.
it's
just
as
simple
as
that.
