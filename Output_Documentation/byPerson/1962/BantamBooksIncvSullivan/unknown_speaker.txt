may
i
just
refer
to
two
short
excerpts.
unknown
speaker
at
page
33
of
the
record,
there's
the
testimony
of
mr.
gerald
kaplan,
the
manager
of
the
silverstein.
incidentally,
when
i
subpoenaed
silverstein,
he
said
kaplan
knows
more
about
this
than
i
do.
please
have
him
as
a
witness
because
he
is
the
important
one.
that's
why
mr.
kaplan
was
the
witness,
not
mr.
silverstein.
the
question
in
64,
i
said
to
mr.
kaplan,
page
33,
“the
substance,
as
i
understand
it,
you
stated
that
books
--
that
you
took
books
on
sale
and
refuse
to
accept
anymore
accounts,
that
you
didn't
sell
anymore
books
was
because
in
effect,
you
didn't
want
to
get
entangled
with
the
authorities,
with
the
commission
in
connection
with
any
court
proceeding.”
answer:
“that
is
correct.”
that
doesn't
sound
as
though
mr.
silverstein
was
reading
books
were
obscene.
now,
i
turn
to
page
--
there's
a
very
--
page
111,
this
is
my
last
reference.
page
111
of
the
record,
there
is
an
interesting
exchange
between
two
members
of
the
commission,
father
flannery
and
mr.
mcaloon,
both
appellees.
and
this
is
their
question
whether
this
was
voluntary
compliance.
in
the
middle
of
page,
father
flannery,
noted
that
he
had
been
called
about
magazines
proscribed
by
the
commission.
this
is
their
own
minutes.
this
was
what
they're
saying,
their
minutes
of
october
9,
1957,
remaining
on
sale
after
list
has
been
sent
to
distributors
and
police
to
which
mr.
mcaloon
suggested
that
it
could
be
that
the
same
magazines
were
seen
but
there
are
probably
was
not
the
same
edition
proscribed
by
the
commission.
father
flannery,
pressing
the
statewide
compliance
by
the
police
or
anyone
else
to
get
the
proscribed
magazines
off
the
stand,
mr.
mcaloon
show
the
commissioners,
the
questionnaire
sent
to
the
chiefs
of
police
from
this
office
and
return
to
us.
the
word
‘proscribed'
in
the
american
college
dictionary
means
prohibited
as,
your
honors
would
well
recognize.
