mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
it
should
be
noted
at
the
outset
that
the
appellants
here,
the
publishers,
do
not
challenge
the
proposition
that
we're
dialing
in
the
exercise
of
this
constitutional
mandate
may
enact
legislation
which
is
designed
to
educate
the
public
in
good
reading
habits
and
at
the
same
time
to
encourage
morality
in
its
youth.
in
view
of
this,
there
are,
it
seems
to
me,
two
issues
to
you.
one
is
the
resolution
in
question
--
resolution
no.
73
constitutional
and
if
so,
are
the
acts
of
the
commission
constitutional?
turning
first
to
the
terms
of
the
resolution,
it
must
be
emphasized
that
the
resolution
does
not
permit,
allow
or
authorize
directly
or
indirectly
the
impairment
of
any
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
appellants.
the
resolution
does
nothing
more
than
great
--
grant
state
sanctions
to
a
group
of
individuals
whose
authority
is
limited
to
educating
the
public
of
rhode
island
with
good
reading
habits
and
to
investigate
in
the
objectionable
material
and
were
warranted
making
recommendations
to
the
attorney
general.
the
commission
has
no
power
beyond
that
listed
in
the
resolution.
it
is
so
limited.
the
resolution
in
my
opinion
does
not
operate
and
cannot
operate
to
impinge
upon
any
of
the
appellant's
rights.
with
reference
to
these
notices,
i
think
it's
fair
to
state
that
these
notices
are
merely
guides
to
these
six
distributors
in
rhode
island
and
their
advisory
in
character,
the
distributor
upon
the
receipt
can
either
accept
them
in
a
spirit
of
cooperation
or
he
can
reject
them,
stand
on
his
ground,
and
sell
these
books
which
are
on
the
list.
i
also
want
to
point
out
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
that's
just
incidental.
there's
nothing
specified
in
the
resolution.
actually,
mr.
justice
douglas,
copies
of
these
notices
are
sent
to
the
chiefs
of
police
in
the
various
cities
and
towns
in
rhode
island.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
actually,
there
hasn't
been
any.
there
was
one
prosecution
in
newport
of
a
distributor
who
were
actually
performing
a
dual
function
there.
he
was
distributor
and
a
retailer
for
selling
a
book
which
was
on
the
list,
the
book
called
‘peyton
place',
and
this
was
a
result
of
a
grand
jury
indictment
for
violation
of
the
--
violating
the
provisions
of
the
criminal
statute.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
well,
of
course,
i
can't
agree
with
the
allotted
conclusion
that
he
agreed
also
that
the
books
were
obscene.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
yes.
if
you
notice
in
the
--
he
agreed
to
cooperate
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
yes
sir,
well,
objectionable.
that's
the
term
i
was
going
to
use
because
you
notice
on
those
the
word
that
was
used
in
all
these
different
notices
not
the
books
were
obscene
but
they
were
objectionable
for
sale,
distribution
and
display
for
youths
under
18.
i
also
want
to
point
this
out
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
well,
of
course
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
well,
it's
my
understanding
mr.
chief
justice
that
some
of
these
books
were
horror
books
and
they
didn't
come
within
the
definition
of
this
court
in
the
roth
case,
and
those
books
were
on
the
list.
some
of
those
books
were
on
the
list.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
no.
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
i
don't
think
so.
in
rhode
island,
we
have
a
very
peculiar
system.
we
don't
have
the
county
attorney
system
or
the
district
attorney
system.
the
attorney
general
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
on
the
prosecution
of
all
criminal
cases.
and
he
has
the
final
word
on
whether
or
not
prosecution
should
be
initiated.
the
members
of
this
commission,
the
most
they
could
do
would
--
they
recommend
and
the
fact
is
they'd
have
recommended
in
some
cases
that
i
initiate
prosecution
against
some
of
these
distributors.
but
there
is
only
one
case
and
i
say
that
didn't
--
that
case
did
not
resolve
this
or
did
not
come
about
as
a
result
of
these
notices.
there's
only
one
case
in
rhode
island
during
the
last
five
years
where
a
bookseller
had
been
prosecuted
for
violating
the
criminal
--
the
provisions
of
the
criminal
anti-obscenity
statute,
and
that
was
in
the
peyton
place
case.
so
that
to
say
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
well,
the
state
prevailed
on
the
jury
trial
level.
the
verdict
was
said
that
the
bookseller
was
guilty
of
selling
an
obscene
book.
the
implication
being
of
course
that
peyton
place
is
obscene
but
the
trial
justice
granted
a
new
trial
on
a
technical
legal
ground
unrelated
to
the
question
of
obscenity.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
as
far
as
i
know,
there
was
--
there
are
six
distributors
by
the
way
in
rhode
island.
four
of
them
complied
and
two
of
them
in
effect
stood
their
ground
and
disregarded
these
notices
and
went
ahead
which
they
had
a
perfect
right
to
do.
and
they
sold
these
books,
and
the
fact
remains
that
not
one
prosecution
was
initiated
as
a
result
of
them
doing
that.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
no,
i
say
this
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
no.
they're
no
the
--
well
of
course,
some
books
around
these
lists
that
were
not
obscene
as
i
understand
it.
some
of
these
are
so-called
horror
books
around
them,
and
as
i
say
in
my
opinion,
they
did
not
come
within
the
definition
of
this
court
in
the
roth
case.
but
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
i
can
say
this,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
i
have
the
final
word
on
whether
or
not
prosecution
should
be
initiated
and
as
i
say
there
was
only
one
case
in
the
last
five
and
a
half
years
which
has
been
initiated
as
a
result
of
--
should
i
say
done
as
a
result
of
these
notices
but
because
in
my
judgment
i
thought
the
book
was
obscene.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
no,
there
is
not.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
no,
i'm
not.
and
i
might
say
that
there
have
been
books
that
have
been
submitted
to
me
for
review
for
appraisal
and
i
have
different,
come
to
a
different
conclusion
that
the
members
of
the
commission
with
reference
to
whether
or
not
they
were
obscene.
and
as
a
result,
no
prosecution
was
initiated.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
not
in
my
judgment,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
feel
that
the
distributor
has
the
choice
either
to
stand
on
his
ground
if
he
differs
with
the
finding
of
the
commission
that
these
books
are
objectionable
and
to
sell
these
books
at
his
peril
and
incidentally,
since
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
smith
case
in
which
as
you
recall
this
court
struck
down
a
los
angeles
ordinance
which
made
a
criminal
offense
to
sell
obscene
books
without
proof
of
scienter
in
that
case.
i
think
that
in
order
to
successfully
prosecute
a
bookseller
for
violating
the
provisions
of
the
criminal
anti-obscenity
statute
in
rhode
island
that
a
person
in
authority
such
as
the
attorney
general
should
make
a
preliminary
judgment
and
put
these
distributors
and
booksellers
on
notice
that
in
the
judgment
of
the
attorney
general,
such
and
such
a
book
is,
in
his
opinion,
legally
obscene
and
then
of
course
the
bookseller
can
stand
on
his
ground
and
sell
a
book
in
his
own
peril,
and
take
his
chances
in
court
with
a
judicial
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
book
is
or
it
is
not
legally
obscene.
we
had
that
situation
about
a
year
ago
in
rhode
island.
the
book
‘tropic
of
cancer'
if
you
recall
that
book
was
band
from
importation
of
the
united
states
from
1935
until
june
of
1961.
and
in
the
fall
of
1961,
the
book
was
on
display
on
the
newsstands,
our
newsstands
in
rhode
island.
a
complaint
was
made
some
may
firstly
that
in
the
opinion
of
this
person,
the
book
was
legally
obscene.
that
was
on
a
friday
afternoon.
i
read
the
book
over
the
weekend
and
i
concur,
and
i
made
a
public
announcement
on
the
following
monday
that
in
my
opinion,
the
book
was
legally
obscene.
and
the
result
was
that
some
of
the
distributors
who
had
issued
these
books
and
had
them
on
the
newsstands
voluntarily
recalled
not
one
bookseller
or
distributor
chose
to
take
his
chances
in
court
with
a
judicial
determination.
there
were
some
criticisms
of
my
action
in
that
case
and
--
but
i
welcomed
a
court
test,
but
it
never
came
about.
and
so
it
is
with
this
situation
here
as
far
as
the
actions
of
the
commission
to
encourage
morality
in
youth.
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
the
phraseology
of
this
resolution.
in
1955
and
1956
in
rhode
island,
we
have
a
--
an
increase
in
these
so-called
trashy
magazine.
i
think
that
was
the
characterization
of
my
brother
mr.
manges,
on
with
reference
to
some
of
these
dirty
magazines.
and
the
legislature
recognized
that
the
situation
and
it
seems
to
me
in
the
exercise
of
that
constitutional
mandate,
they
enacted
this
resolution
and
they
were
very
careful
with
reference
to
the
phraseology.
i
was
a
member
of
the
legislature
at
that
time
and
i
remembered
very
well.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
they
actually
did
two
things.
first
of
all,
in
the
very
first
paragraph,
they
authorized
this
commission
to
educate
the
public
that
was
probably
used
under
18
but
also
adults
as
well.
and
then
later
on,
it
also
said
to
investigate
the
causes
of
juvenile
delinquency
and
to
make
recommendations
to
the
attorney
general.
and
it
wasn't
until
july
of
1957
that
this
commission
started
to
send
out
these
notices.
i
can
frankly
say,
“hey,
i
never
saw
these
notices
before
they
went
out.”
but
my
predecessor,
mr.
--
who
is
now
on
the
supreme
court
of
rhode
island,
mr.
justice
powers,
he
did.
and
he
advised
the
members
of
this
commission
to
send
out
these
notices,
these
guide
lists
which,
in
our
judgment,
are
merely
advisory
and
nothing
more.
and
the
distributor,
as
i
said
before,
can
stand
his
ground
and
sell
these
magazines,
books
and
magazines
at
his
own
peril.
this
situation,
this
factual
situation,
i
think
is
very
important.
and
it's
quite
unlike
the
situation
you
have
in
new
jersey
in
the
melko
case,
and
that
was
around
1954
with
reference
to
the
book
“the
chinese
room”.
and
in
that
case,
the
county
prosecutor,
one
of
the
counties
in
new
jersey,
he
made
a
statement
and
in
his
opinion
that
this
books
was
obscene
and
that
anybody
who
had
it
in
their
possession,
any
news
dealer
or
bookseller
should
get
it
out
of
circulation
and
the
result
was
the
action
was
instituted
against
it.
and
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
in
that
case,
there
--
actually
it
was
in
1953,
bantam
books
secured
an
injunction
in
the
superior
court
against
the
prosecutor.
the
appeal
limited
it
in
the
appeal,
the
appeals
court,
it
limited
their
decision
to
the
single
book
in
issue,
“the
chinese
room”.
it
rejected
as
rule
the
superior
court's
ruling
that
the
prosecutor
lack
the
authority
to
promulgate
list
of
objectionable
books.
the
prosecutor
took
this
as
a
blanket
endorsement
of
his
activities
and
threatened
a
new
drive,
that's
a
next
shift
in
the
new
york
times
and
also
it's
in
the
38
minnesota
law
review
at
295.
but
this
is
different
because
in
new
jersey
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
mr.
justice
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
mr.
justice
black,
in
answer
to
your
question,
first
of
all
i
think
that
the
county
prosecuting
attorney
had
some
foresight
to
foresee
what
--
by
chance
of
course,
what
(voice
overlap).
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
i
think
as
it
turned
out,
having
in
mind
the
smith
case,
i
think
if
something
like
this
has
got
to
be
done
today
by
somebody
in
authority
such
as
a
county
prosecutor
in
those
states
where
they
have
the
county
prosecutor
system
or
in
those
states
where
they
have
the
district
attorney
system
who
prosecutes
for
the
district
attorney
prosecutes
criminal
cases,
or
as
in
rhode
island
where
the
attorney
general
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
prosecution
of
criminal
cases
that
he
has
got
to
do
something
like
that.
in
other
words,
he's
got
to
make
a
preliminary
judgment
and
what
his
opinion
is
to
put
these
booksellers
and
distributors
on
notice.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
no,
i
do
not.
but
this
very
simple
reason,
mr.
justice
black,
this
board
had
no
power
or
whatsoever
other
than
what
it
expressly
declared
in
the
resolution.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
to
initiate
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
prosecution.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
right.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
i
agree
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
i
agree
with
that
conclusion.
i
think
that
this
resolution
was
designed
originally
for
that
very
purpose.
but
there
was
no
teeth
put
into
this
resolution.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
that's
right.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
that's
right.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
yes,
sir.
that's
right,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
if
you
notice
in
the
--
in
those
notices
that
says
by
majority
vote
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
they
find
these
books
to
be
or
magazines
to
be
objectionable
for
sale
to
youths
under
18.
i
think
they
have
in
mind
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
butler
case.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
well
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
now,
that
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
well,
i
can
--
i
was
going
to
say
that
that
happened
in
california
in
the
tropic
of
cancer
case
where
two
different
juries,
one
in
los
angeles
county
up
in
the
section
of
beverly
hills,
they
found
the
book
to
be
legally
obscene,
tropic
of
cancer
whereas
in
marion
county,
apparently
have
different
community
standards,
they
found
the
book
not
to
be
legally
obscene.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
i
--
frankly,
as
far
as
i
know
it's
not
on
the
list
of
objectionable
books
to
be
sold
to
youths
under
18
which
should
not
be
sold
to
youths
under
18,
lady
chatterley's
lover.
i
think
that's
correctly
do
on
style
as
far
as
the
reading
public
of
rhode
island
is
concerned.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
lady
chatterley's
lover,
as
far
as
i
know
it's
not
on
the
list
of
objectionable
books
for
those
--
for
youths
under
18.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
no,
i
did
not.
that
was
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
that
i
do
not
know.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
no,
they
are
not.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
no.
they
are
sent
to
the
distributors
and
there
are
six
of
them
in
rhode
island
and
there
are
also
copies
of
those
notices
are
sent
to
the
chiefs
of
police.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
that
these
copies
of
the
notices
i
sent
to
the
various
police
departments
in
rhode
island
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
incidentally,
the
police
department
checked
up
on
these
books
before
the
commission
ever
came
into
existence.
they
were
just
following
up
a
new
policy
or
procedure
that's
been
in
existence
for
a
long
time
in
rhode
island
starting
out
with
the
city
of
providence.
they
had
an
amusement
officer.
they
call
him
amusement
officer.
they
are
used
to
pass
upon
films
then
the
scope
of
his
work
brought
him
to
other
fields
probably
books
and
magazines.
and
as
far
as
i
know,
the
providence
police
department,
at
least
i
can
say
this,
they
were
the
most
active
to
follow
up
these
notices
as
they
did
with
--
at
the
outset,
they
went
to
silverstein's
place
and
to
find
out
how
many
books
that
run
on
the
list
were
in
circulation
and
what
thing
did
they
do
as
a
result
of
receiving
these
notices.
i
want
to
say
this
to
the
court
that
in
rhode
island
we're
in
favor
of
giving
these
publishers
their
day
in
court.
they've
never
avail
of
themselves
of
it
either
in
the
tropic
of
cancer
controversy,
not
that
it
was
published
by
any
of
the
publishing
companies
that
mr.
manges
represents
but
even
with
references
in
having
their
distributors
and
i
think
it's
worthy
of
note
here
that
the
distributors
are
not
complaining,
it's
the
publishers
who
are
complaining.
the
distributor
and
this
man
silverstein
is
a
very
intelligent
man
as
i
remember
the
rhode
island
bar.
this,
in
my
opinion,
i
can
truthfully
say
as
a
voluntary
act
on
his
part
to
cooperate
with
this
commission.
and
as
a
result
of
course
his
cooperation,
the
bookstands
in
rhode
island
according
to
the
annual
reports
of
the
governor
are
in
better
condition
now
with
reference
to
obscenity
than
they
ever
were
in
the
last
ten
years.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
that
was
not
the
distributor.
that
was
his
manager,
mr.
chief
justice,
who
made
that
statement.
yes.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
yes.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
yes.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
you
should
rather
to
get
into
court
controversy
of
some
kind
that
they
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
--
complied.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
the
distributors
read
them
all?
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
that's
not
being
done,
no.
no
sir.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
i
think
so.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
first,
i
think
it's
designed
to
educate
the
public
of
rhode
island
with
good
reading
habits.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
well,
i
say
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
well,
they
--
it's
not
a
question.
i
can
put
it
in
a
negative
way
better
i
think.
it's
not
a
question
of
telling
to
the
adult
public,
of
course,
in
both
classes,
adults
and
those
under
18
what
they
can
or
cannot
read.
it's
merely
in
my
opinion,
they
have
another
side
of
this
right
away.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
yes,
indeed
it
is.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
well
they
do
it
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
by
sending
out
these
lists
to
the
distributors
of
books
that
are
objectionable
for
sale,
distribution
and
display
to
youths
under
18.
that's
one.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
those
notices
are
designed
really
in
the
hopeful
expectation
that
these
distributors
will
cooperate
with
these
notices.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
well
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
i
think
that's
the
hopeful
expectation
of
the
members
of
the
commission.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
the
distinction
between
the
two?
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
distinction.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
incidentally,
there's
no
publication
of
these
notices.
these
are
sent
for
whatever
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
well,
of
course,
as
i
say,
i
can
put
it
to
you
this
way.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
yes,
there
is
another
purpose
and
it's
an
affirmative
one,
to
cultivate
good
reading
habits
in
the
adult
and
not
only
the
adults
but
those
under
18.
they
have
another
list,
which
they
recommend,
of
books
which
are
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
that's
right.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
yes,
but
their
recommendations
as
far
as
the
reading
of
these
books
is
concerned
as
i
say,
is
not
compulsory,
it's
not
a
mandatory
thing
on
the
part
of
anybody
to
accept
it.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
they
don't
do
that
in
rhode
island.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
and
i
don't
think
it'd
be
permissible
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
yes,
you
could
go
on
and
in
other
classification
of
people
too.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
no.
i
don't
mean
anything
and
i
say
they
don't
do
it.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
that's
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
my
answer
to
that
is
that
if
you
come
to
the
conclusion
as
i
have
that
these
notices,
these
guide
lists
are
merely
advisory
in
character
not
binding
on
anyone
particularly
the
book
distributors
or
the
booksellers.
i
say,
if
you
come
to
that
conclusion,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
they
have
no
value
whatsoever
as
far
as
official
sanction
is
concerned.
it's
something
that
during
on
their
own,
they
don't
have
any
expressed
authorization
to
do
it
in
the
resolution
which
created
this
commission.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
that's
true.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
and
yet
if
that's
so,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
bookseller
or
the
book
distributor
can
take
issue
with
the
prosecutor
and
say
--
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
members
of
the
--
yes.
but
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
law
which
prohibits
a
private
citizen
from
going
to
the
local
prosecutor
whether
he'd
be
a
district
attorney
or
county
attorney
or
the
attorney
general
in
making
complaint
that
in
his
opinion,
the
individual
citizen's
opinion
that
the
distributor
has,
in
his
possession,
a
certain
book
which
in
his
opinion
is
legally
obscene
and
says
to
this
distributor,
“if
you
don't
get
it
out
of
your
possession,
if
you
don't
sent
it
back
to
the
publisher,
then
i'm
going
over
to
the
prosecutor
and
i'm
going
to
make
a
square
out
a
criminal
complaint.
i
think
there's
nothing
else
about
that.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
well,
of
course,
i
didn't
use
the
word
threaten,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
hope
that
it
was
not
interpreted
to
mean
that
the
citizen
was
threatening
these
bookseller
or
distributor.
he
was
merely
putting
him
on
notice
of
this
thing,
that
in
his
individual
opinion
that
this
book
was
legally
obscene.
now,
if
you
multiply
that
individual
by
nine
as
you
have
here,
this
is
a
nine-member
commission,
the
only
thing
different
about
that
and
the
result
is
that
this
commission
has
been
created
by
the
state
legislature.
actually,
it's
a
state
agency.
and
so
from
that
standpoint,
it
has
some
standing
but
the
important
thing,
i
think,
to
remember
is
that
they
have
no
power
to
prosecute,
to
initiate
prosecution
that
that
is
exclusively
belongs
to
the
attorney
general
and
as
this
court
has
said
on
federal
questions,
he
has
the
final
word.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
no,
i
think
that
clearly
would
be
unconstitutional
in
my
opinion
to
acquire.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
well,
for
one
thing,
first
of
all,
you
have
a
--
the
legislature
by
legislative
fiat
declaring
that
such
and
such
a
book
is
obscene.
mr.
j.
joseph
nugent
it
seems
to
me
it
violates
at
least
one
provision
of
the
federal
constitution.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
