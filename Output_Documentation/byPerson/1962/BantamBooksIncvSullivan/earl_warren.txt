118,
bantam
books,
incorporated
et

appellants
versus
joseph

sullivan
et
al.
mr.
manges.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
proceed,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
say
you
have
--
you
said
you
have
one
more
constitutional
point
to
raise,
did
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
give
you
five
minutes
to
sum
up
and
then
i
would
give
the
attorney
general,
of
course,
five
minutes
more
also.
chief
justice
earl
warren
attorney
general
nugent.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
why
would
they
have
the
right
to
recommend
prosecutions
for
the
sale
of
any
book
that
was
not
obscene
or
indecent
just
because
it
was
objectionable
to
the
commission?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
be
subject
to
prosecution
in
rhode
island?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
wouldn't
it
be
a
restraint
if
the
state
commission
recommended
prosecution
for
such
things?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
what
extent
mr.
attorney
general
did
the
booksellers
comply
with
these
recommendations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
that
mean
that
the
power
of
the
commission
is
a
dead
letter
or
does
it
mean
that
the
law
wasn't
enforced?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
as
a
matter
of
practical
effect
of
this
commission,
if
two
of
the
main
distributors
of
the
state
have
distributed
these
things
for
six
years
now
and
four
of
them
have
gone
entirely
out
of
business
so
far
as
these
publications
are
concerned,
and
many
of
them
are
magazines
that
could
not
be
proscribed,
doesn't
it
follow
that
there
has
been
a
restraint
on
the
publication
of
literature
that
it
is
not
unlawful?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
far
as
you
know,
this
is
on
sale
in
rhode
island?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
wondering
mr.
attorney
general,
if
these
lists
of
books
are
made
public,
the
list
that
they
send
to
the
chiefs
of
police
and
to
the
stores
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
not
published.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
mr.
--
whatever
his
name
is
who
is
distributing
these,
didn't
he
say
that
he
just
wanted
to
do
to
cooperate
or
didn't
you
say
he
did
it
in
order
to
avoid
being
involved
with
the
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
his
manager.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
someone
on
his
behalf.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
have
gone
beyond
obscenity
and
indecency,
haven't
they,
because
you
say
they
have
included
in
their
lists
some
of
these
books
that
you
describe
as
horror
books
that
cannot
be
proscribed
because
of
any
violation
of
public
morals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
saying
and
wondering
about
the
same
things
justice
black
would,
how
far
can
they
go
in
that
if
it
isn't
--
if
they
don't
want
to
stop
proscribing
or
recommending
the
stoppage
of
horror
books,
then
could
they
go
to
some
other
kind
of
literatures,
some
other
kind
of
literature
and
until
there'd
be
--
there
would
be
a
very
clear
restriction
of
literature.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
haven't
been
a
prosecutor
myself.
i
always
felt
that
there
was
some
significance
to
the
action
of
a
--
of
a
state
or
body
saying
now
either
you
do
so
and
so
or
i'm
going
to
go
to
the
public
prosecutor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i'm
just
wondering
if
that
isn't
using
state
--
the
state
to
proscribe
the
same
with
these
things.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
isn't
the
prosecutor
he's
taking
issue
with.
it's
these
other
people
who
are
initiating.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
don't
know
a
private
citizen
can
save
to
contract
in
a
man
in
that
manner
but
i
do
believe
that
a
prosecuting
officer
could
say
after
reviewing
the
book
in
his
opinion
it
is
and
if
he
continues
to
sell
it,
that
he's
going
to
prosecute
him.
i
think
that's
alright.
i'm
not
so
sure
that
a
private
citizen
could
threaten
a
man
because
that
could
come
pretty
close
to
extortion
and
a
lot
of
cases.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
(voice
overlap).
yes,
alright.
