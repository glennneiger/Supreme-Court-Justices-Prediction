three
times
now
and
it's
the
reason
to
my
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
advise
that
--
i
want
to
object
as
to
mr.
davis'
counsel
to
the
state,
i
want
to
object
to
the
records,
to
the
segregation
ordinance,
this
ordinance
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
manner
of
segregation.
i
think
he'd
need
a
trespass
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
court
--
wouldn't
it
apply
equally
to
everybody
and
i
take
it
that
refers
to
the
segregation
ordain
--
ordinance.
i
overrule
the
objection.
justice

m.
harlan

it
could
be
certain
if
you
read
it
to
me,
my
objections
is
as
to
what
the
judge
says
as
to
what
the
ordinance
(inaudible)
use
the
question
of
the
law
to
distinguish
what
effect
the

the
actions
of
the

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
would
like
to
ask
you
two
questions.
from
your
brief
in
the
supreme
court,
did
you
raise
specifically
the
exclusion
or
the
alleged
exclusion
of
inquiry
respecting
the
state
ordinance,
the
city
ordinance?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
error,
did
you
raise
that
as
error?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
--
i'm
talking
about
the
brief.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
brief.
it
was
not
raised
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan

wonder
with
the
permission
of
the
chief
justice
you
would
leave
a
copy
of
the
brief
in
the
supreme
court.
