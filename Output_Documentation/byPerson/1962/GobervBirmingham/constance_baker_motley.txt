ms.
constance
baker
motley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
10
negro
students
attending
daniel
payne
college
in
birmingham,
alabama.
they
are
here
pursuant
to
title
28,
united
states
code
section
1257,
seeking
a
reversal
of
their
convictions
for
trespass
after
warning
by
the
alabama
court.
now,
relying
on
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
these
petitioners
repeatedly
find
the
law
and
assert
here
that
their
convictions
are
constitutionally
void
because
they
are
the
product
of
state
action
manifestly
prohibited
by
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
all
10
petitioners
were
arrested
on
march
31st,
1960
following
sit-in
demonstrations
in
five
birmingham
department
stores.
they
at
that
time
were
seeking
food
service
at
a
lunch
counter
limited
to
white
persons.
each
petitioner
was
charged
and
convicted
of
violating
section
1436
of
the
birmingham
code,
a
trespass
after
warning
statute
which
appears
on
page
2
of
our
brief.
there
are
five
trials
in
these
cases,
one,
petitioner
was
tried
and
then
it
was
stipulated
that
the
testimony
as
to
that
one
petitioner
would
apply
to
his
companion.
you
see,
two
petitioners
went
into
each
of
these
five
stores.
and
they
were
first
tried
in
the
recorder's
court
of
the
city
of
birmingham
and
convicted
and
then
appealed
to
the
circuit
court,
their
convictions
were
--
they
affirmed
and
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
alabama
which
is
the
only
court
that
wrote
an
opinion
and
certiorari
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
was
denied.
now
the
significant
facts
in
all
of
these
cases
are
relatively
the
same.
the
first
important
fact
is
that
birmingham
has
a
city
ordinance
which
makes
it
unlawful
to
serve
negroes
and
whites
in
the
same
room.
that
ordinance
appears
on
page
2
of
our
brief.
now
this
ordinance
is
a
part
of
a
massive
state
policy
of
racial
segregation,
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
alabama
segregation
statutes.
all
of
the
petitioners
of
course
are
negroes.
for
one
successfully
sought
service
in
department
stores
where
negroes
are
welcomed
and
served
at
all
counters
except
the
lunch
counter
where
this
ordinance
requires
that
there
be
racial
segregation.
now,
in
every
one
of
these
cases,
the
petitioners
were
asked
to
leave
the
counter
by
some
representative
of
the
store
in
the
sense
that
they
were
told
that
they
could
not
be
served
there
or
we
have
a
counter
for
negroes
on
the
fourth
floor,
in
the
basement
once
you
go
there.
or
in
some
instances,
the
counter
was
closed
after
the
negroes
appeared
and
were
told
this
and
didn't
leave.
now,
the
police
arrived
and
the
police
arrived
in
some
instances
when
the
people
were
still
eating
and
the
police
arrived
and
not
pursuant
to
a
call
from
any
member
of
the
store
in
any
case.
and
this
--
that
the
record
is
absolutely
clear
on
that
that
no
employee
in
any
one
of
the
five
stores
called
the
police.
moreover
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
and
every
case,
the
officer
testified
that
he
was
directed
to
go
there
either
by
a
superior
officer
or
by
a
call
over
the
radio
in
his
car
from
police
headquarters.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
it
doesn't.
but
he
testified
that
he
was
directed
by
a
superior
or
a
call
from
the
police
headquarters
and
every
store
employee
testified
that
he
or
she
did
not
call
the
police
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
and
that
was
clear.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no
sir,
i
don't
believe
there's
any
indication
to
that
effect.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
i
would
say
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
oh,
i
would
say
in
this
case
like
--
unlike
the
others,
we
have
the
ordinance
which
was
clearly
in
the
record
i
think
or
the
court
certainly
was
required
to
take
judicial
notice
of
it
but
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
even
if
they
were
not
an
ordinance
in
this
case,
the
rest
of
the
petitioners
and
their
conviction
in
this
matter
in
these
circumstances
would
still
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
if
this
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes
sir,
on
page
24
of
the
record,
the
representative
from
kress'
department
store
was
on
the
stand
and
he
was
asked
what
the
petitioners
have
been
told.
answer,
on
page
24,
he
told
them,
“it
would
be
against
the
law
to
serve
them
there”.
then
petitioners
counsel
asked
him
about
this
ordinance
which
i've
just
referred
to
and
there
was
an
objection
by
the
respondent
--
by
the
lawyer
for
the
city
and
the
judge
sustained
that,
he
said
he
didn't
think
the
witness
--
his
knowledge
of
the
law
was
material
or
anything
like
that
and
the
counsel
for
the
defendants
here
said,
“this
is
the
whole
theory
of
our
case”.
and
the
court
would
not
permit
him
to
develop
that
theory
of
the
case.
he
said
that,
“we
want
to
show”,
as
he
says
at
the
bottom,
“it
is
our
theory
of
this
case,
it
is
one,
they
simply
on
the
city
segregation
ordinance”.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
oh,
certainly.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
as
i
say
that
the
court
was
not
--
have
been
to
develop
it
but
i
think
this
case
shows
--
this
record
shows
that
this
ordinance
was
what
was
being
enforced
because
each
police
officer
came
in
to
the
store
and
on
the
stand
he
was
asked,
“what
did
you
see
unusual
as
you
came
in
to
the
store?”
and
each
one
replied,
“i
saw
two
negroes
sitting
on
the
couch”,
and
for
him
that
was
enough.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
he
didn't
refer
to
--
specifically
to
an
ordinance
but
in
one
case,
he
said,
“i
arrested
them
under
the
authority
of
the
city
of
birmingham”.
but
the
police
officer,
he
--
in
most
instances
he
spoke
to
no
one
as
he
came
in.
in
one
case
he
said,
“mrs.
evans
gave
me
the
complaint”.
the
petitioner
said,
they
never
saw
mrs.
evans
until
that
--
she
got
to
court,
the
recorder's
court
so
that
the
testimony
in
each
case
says
that
the
police
officers
went
in
and
did
not
speak
to
any
employee
of
the
store
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
what
i
just
read
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
in
the
other
cases,
i
think
the
court
made
it
clear
to
the
lawyer,
he
wasn't
(inaudible)
--
have
that
testimony.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
and
then
in
another
place,
the
lawyer
for
the
petitioners
wanted
to
bring
out
that
these
people
would
have
been
served
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the
ordinance
and
the
court
cuts
that
off.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes
sir.
it's
--
one
on
page
67
and
one
on
page
168.
the
court
said
at
this
point
in
the
middle
of
that
page,
“is
there
any
question
before
the
court
now?”
and
mr.
hall,
the
lawyer
for
petitioner
said,
“if
your
honor
pleases,
we
have
asked
mr.
sterling
(ph)
about
new
various
policy.”
the
court
-
“that
is
not
competent”.
and
then
he
took
an
exception.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
the
appellate
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
pardon
me?
ms.
constance
baker
motley
he
--
they
didn't
say
anything
about
that
specific
ruling.
they
ignored
all
the
evidence
of
the
state
policy
--
the
state
ordinance.
and
said,
the
owner
here
was
exercising
his
right
to
choose
his
own
customers.
as
to
the
ordinance,
they
said
it
has
not
been
pleaded
and
therefore
they
wouldn't
pass
on
that
but
there
is
a
statute
in
alabama
which
requires
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
an
ordinance.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
the
court
of
appeals
of
alabama.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
they
said
that
it
should
have
been
pleaded
that
we
should
have
by
some
pleading
set
forth
that
ordinance.
well
of
course,
i
don't
believe
that's
true
because
number
one,
you
could
take
judicial
notice
of
it,
and
number
two,
the
petitioner
said
my
whole
defense
is
there.
and
certainly,
that
was
before
the
court
when
it
reviewed
the
case.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
of
course
they're
not
and
i
--
the
court
in
making
its
decision
just
ignored
all
of
the
evidence
here
that
the
police
came
in,
that
the
storeowner
did
not
call
the
police
that
even
after
the
police
arrived,
the
storeowners
did
not
request
the
arrest.
and
the
officer
was
asked
in
every
case,
“was
an
arrest
requested?”
so
it's
clear
i
think
that
the
state
was
acting
in
this
case
to
enforce
a
state
policy
regardless
of
what
the
owner's
policy
might
have
been.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
i
think
that
here,
the
--
as
far
as
the
free
speech
--
are
you
saying
or
the
donor
with
respect
to
no
evidence.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
think
that
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
petitioners
were
asked
to
leave
the
store
by
some
representative
of
the
store
and
in
that
sense,
this
evidence
that
they
were
asked
to
leave.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
now,
as
to
the
garner
case,
what
we
say
with
reference
to
that
is
that
this
situation
is
like
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
harlan
in
garner
that
here,
the
storeowners
were
apparently
willing
to
endure
this
controversy.
they
did
not
call
the
police.
when
the
police
came,
they
didn't
ask
if
they'd
be
arrested.
and
so
these
petitioners
were
there
demonstrating
against
the
state's
policy
of
enforcing
segregation
and
they
demonstrated
in
this
manner
by
sitting
themselves
at
the
counter,
quietly
asking
for
service
like
anyone
else
who
as
white
does.
and
the
owner
apparently
was
willing
to,
as
i
say,
endure
this
kind
of
controversy
in
this
manner.
if
he
was
not,
he
obviously
would
have
called
the
police.
when
the
police
arrived,
he
would
have
said
i
wanted
them
arrested.
and
there's
no
question
that
they
were
peaceful.
there
were
only
two
in
each
store.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no
sir.
there
--
gober
was
tried
and
his
companion
was
davis.
davis
was
not
separately
tried.
the
testimony
as
to
gober
was
stipulated
as
a
testimony
as
to
davis.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no
sir.
and
then
the
next
two
came
up.
they
were
in
a
different
store.
one
was
tried,
the
testimony
as
to
that
--
defendant
was
stipulated
as
to
his
companion
and
so
forth.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
after
that,
he
didn't
mention
the
ordinance
again.
but
as
i
say,
there's
a
state
statute
which
requires
the
courts
to
take
judicial
notice
of
ordinances
in
cities
of
a
certain
size
of
which
birmingham
certainly
is
one.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
one
after
the
other.
they
were
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
before
the
same
judge
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes
sir,
same
counsel.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
they
were
treated
as
a
whole.
the
motions
were
all
identical
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
they
were.
i
believe
they
were.
and
the
sentencing
was
a
joint
sentencing
for
all
of
them.
they
were
treated
as
one
case.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
think
that's
some
confusion
in
the
record
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
when
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
it's
very
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
but
then
mr.
harlan,
on
--
to
ask
about
the
ordinance
and
he
then
said
that
wasn't
competent.
and
i
think
that
what
he
intended
to
say
was
that
he
was
sustaining
the
objection
of
the
city's
--
city
attorney
to
the
introduction
of
any
testimony
concerning
the
ordinance.
it's
very
confusing.
i
was
not
at
the
trial
and
the
way
i
read
it
here
this
is
what
he
was
really
doing.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
pardon
me?
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
he
did
not
let
him
put
in
that
evidence
regarding
the
ordinance.
so
what
he
was
doing
was
sustaining
the
city's
objection
to
the
introduction
of
testimony
regarding
the
effect
of
the
ordinance.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
think
that
what
the
court
was
saying
that
he
didn't
want
any
testimony
regarding
that
ordinance
in
this
record.
that's
the
way
i
read
it.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
i
think
it's
subject
to
that
interpretation,
yes.f
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
i
think
at
that
point
he
was
talking
about
kress'
policy
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
the
man
at
the
storeowner's
policy.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
they
were
talking
about
both
i
think
at
this
point.
he
said
that
the
manager's
policy
was
not
material.
he
also
said
that
the
ordinance
was
not.
as
i
understand
the
trial
judge,
he
didn't
want
to
hear
that
this
is
--
would
serve
these
people
notwithstanding
the
ordinance.
he
didn't
want
to
hear
that
either.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
he
was
the
president
or
vice
president
of
the
business,
the
person
who
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
i
think
i
would
like
to
save
the
remaining
portion
of
my
time
for
the
rebuttal.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
not
that
i
know
of
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
controlling
consideration
is
whether
the
court
below
or
the
highest
court
of
the
state
which
could
have
rendered
an
opinion
or
did
render
an
opinion,
considered
and
disposed
of
the
constitutional
issues
which
we
are
here
presenting
to
this
court.
and
on
page
61
of
the
record,
the
court
in
the
last
paragraph
of
its
opinion
says,
“counsel
has
argued
among
other
matters,
various
faces
of
constitutional
law
particularly
as
affected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution
such
as
freedom
of
speech”,
in
regard
to
which
counsel
state,
“what
has
become
known
as
a
sit-in
is
a
different
but
well-understood
symbol,
meaningful
method
of
communication”.
and
the
court
says,
“counsel
has
also
referred
to
cases
pertaining
to
restrictive
covenants.
we
consider
such
principles
entirely
inapplicable
to
the
present
case.”
and
on
page
60
of
the
record,
they
point
out
that
they
can
consider
in
this
type
of
proceeding
because
the
civil
rules
govern
on
appeal,
the
matters
raised
and
argued
in
the
brief.
and
so
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
in
brief
for
counsel
--
in
brief,
counsel
for
appellant
argues
that
the
complaint
is
insufficient
--
is
insufficient
and
not
setting
forth
--
i'm
sorry,
that's
not
it.

ms.
constance
baker
motley
this
being
an
appeal
from
a
conviction
for
violating
a
city
ordinance.
it
is
quasi
criminal
in
nature,
and
subject
to
rules
governing
civil
appeals.
accordingly,
we
will
limit
our
review
to
errors
assigned
and
argued
in
appellant's
brief.
and
of
course,
this
is
cited
in
number
of
alabama
cases.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
really
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
really
don't
know.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
it
appears
if
that's
what
they
mean
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
raise
certain
--
well,
accordingly,
we
will
limit
our
review
to
errors
assigned
so
that
errors
were
assigned
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
and
argued
in
appellant's
brief.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
and
these
matters
and
particularly
the
fourteenth
amendment
questions
was
certainly
assigned
as
error
and
argued
in
our
brief
and
considered
by
the
court
and
disposed
of
by
the
court.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right
your
honor.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right
your
honor.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
and
on
that
point,
we
say
you
have
the
statute
which
says
that
the
court
must
take
judicial
notice
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
but
it
didn't.
but
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
we've
cite
it
in
our
brief.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
our
petition
for
cert
--
i'm
sorry,
i
believe
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
in
our
petition
for
cert.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
well,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
here,
the
court
was
required
by
the
state
law
to
take
judicial
notice
of
this
ordinance
and
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
think
really,
we
did
more
than
that.
we
said
it
to
the
court,
our
whole
defense
is
the
ordinance
and
i
think
that
when
we
said
that,
we
were
saying
everything
that
we
were
required
to
with
this
kind
of
proceeding
to
advise
the
court
and
the
other
side
of
what
our
theory
was.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
and
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
in
the
brief,
i
believe
they
did
mention
it
because
the
court
itself
says
that
it
was
not
raised
by
a
pleading.
you're
here
arguing
it
but
it
wasn't
raised
by
a
pleading.
that's
the
way
they
treated
it.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
they
considered
it
in
the
sense
that
they
said,
“here,
you
are
arguing
it
and
you
didn't
put
it
in
a
pleading.
we
think
it
should
have
been
raised
by
a
plea.”
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right
but
then
they
--
as
to
that
ordinance.
but
then
they
went
on
to
decide
that
this
case
was
not
governed
by
the
restrictive
covenant
cases.
and
the
only
reason
we're
assigning
the
ordinance
was
to
show
that
there
was
state
action
and
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
again,
even
if
the
ordinance
were
not
involved
here,
we
would
still
be
properly
before
this
court
on
shelley
against
kraemer
because
there
was
this
massive
state
policy
of
racial
segregation
which
we
say
compel
the
owner
to
put
these
people
out
and
the
state
cannot
escape
responsibility
for
that.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
don't
recall.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
just
a
moment.
i
don't
believe
it
was
your
honor
raised
as
such.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
the
exclusion
of
the
test
of
the
evidence
after
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
in
the
brief?
ms.
constance
baker
motley
now,
that
i
don't
have
a
copy
of
--
with
here
so
i
can't
answer
that
with
definiteness
that
it
was
so
raised.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
we
will.
we'll
try
to
get
a
copy
of
the
brief
that
was
presented
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
now,
i
wanted
to
point
out
with
reference
to
a
question
asked
me
earlier
by
mr.
justice
goldberg.
there
was
in
the
record
a
stipulation
that
the
rulings
made
in
the
first
case
would
apply
to
all
other
cases
and
that
appears
on
page
106
of
the
record
and
on
page
122
of
the
record.
not
just
the
pleadings
were
to
be
the
same
but
the
rulings
which
he
has
made
in
the
first
case
were
the
rulings
in
the
other
cases
and
that's
why
they
didn't
again
raise
that
question
as
to
the
ordinance.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
122,
106
and
122.
and
as
i‘ve
said
before
in
closing,
this
ordinance
was
just
a
part
of
a
massive
state
policy
here
of
racial
segregation
and
the
owner
was
influenced
and
compelled
by
this
policy
to
refuse
service
to
these
petitioners
at
this
counter.
and
the
state
bears
full
responsibility
for
the
owner's
exclusion
where
they
specifically
relied
on
the
ordinance
or
not
because
here
was
a
state
policy
which
compelled
them
to
exclude
these
people
from
the
counter.
and
we
say
that
for
this
reason,
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
clearly
violated
here
and
the
state
certainly
cannot
escape
responsibility
until
such
time
as
it
takes
affirmative
action
to
change
that
policy
such
as
has
been
done
in
other
northern
states
by
the
enactment
of
civil
rights
laws.
i
think
the
influence
of
the
states
designed
to
set
up
a
segregated
society
as
what
is
controlling
here.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes
they
are
sir,
they
are.
they're
not
like
the
other
cases
where
the
policy
has
been
abandoned.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
think
if
those
laws
were
repealed
with
the
understanding
and
a
preamble
to
the
repeal
that
this
was
done
to
do
away
with
state
enforced
segregation
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
we
have
a
different
situation.
but
as
long
as
the
state's
policy
is
there
on
the
books,
this
is
the
thing
which
we
say
influences
discrimination
in
a
public
place
of
this
kind
whether
the
statute
or
ordinance
specifically
says
department
store
or
drugstore
or
whatever
the
situation
maybe
that
the
state's
policy
is
there.
and
that's
the
operative
consideration
which
makes
the
person
exclude
you.
and
until
the
state
chose
some
affirmative
change
in
that
policy,
that
influence
is
still
there,
we'd
say.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
what
i
have
in
mind
is
that
here,
alabama
has
not.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
alabama
in
this
case
has
not
required
equal
treatment
of
negroes
in
places
of
public
accommodations
as
this
court
in
deciding
the
civil
rights
cases
assumed
that
the
states
would.
i
remember
the
civil
rights
cases,
they
said,
we
assumed
that
the
states
would
protect
you
against
this.
well,
this
isn't
true
in
alabama
and
these
other
states.
the
states
of
course
has
done
just
the
opposite
and
they
have
done
it
in
a
massive
way
so
that
the
whole
society
is
set
up
on
a
segregated
basis.
and
this
influences
the
determination
of
businessman
in
the
state.
and
we
say
that
the
state
in
order
to
get
away
from
or
escape
responsibility
for
this
enforced
segregation
would
have
to
do
something
more
affirmative
than
it
has
now
up
to
this
point.
it
does
not
protect
us
against
the
policy
which
it
has
set
up.
