now
with

yes
but
i

that
but
there

no
(inaudible)
by

justice
arthur

or
the

(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.

(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
the
motion
(inaudible)?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
look
at
page
12
of
the
record.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
granted
below
(inaudible)
each
defendants
had
the
evidence
in
this
case,
the
evidence
to
go
on
the
specific
there
is
--
this
ruling,
to
overrule
the
objection
and
then
on
(inaudible).
is
that
properly
raised
the
issue
to
(inaudible)
the
case?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
you
didn't
try
it
yourself.
first,
in
the
(inaudible)
pleadings
been
demurred
and
then
(inaudible)
into
evidence.
and
was
it
to
exclude
evidence
that
(inaudible)
reference
to
constitutional
issue?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
davis
ask
you
this?
you
refer
to
your
ordinance
which
is
in
the
record
at
page
58,
would
it
not
be
a
violation
of
your
ordinance
as
agreed
on
its
face
or
any
of
these
defendants
to
have
refused
to
leave
after
being
warned
by
the
police
independently
of
what
the
storeowner
said?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
doesn't
the
state
--
doesn't
the
ordinance
say
that?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
except
the
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
except
the
ordinance
itself
does
not
require
the
warning
to
be
by
the
owner.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
in
other
words,
what
you're
saying
here
is
that
the
ordinance
doesn't
say
so
but
it
would
have
to
be
construed
that
way.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
wasn't
the
complaint
here
based
upon
the
ordinance
and
the
complaint
itself
also
didn't
say
anything
about
the
owner.
so
isn't
the
non-guilty
plea
then
putting
an
issue
--
all
that
was
put
in
an
issue
by
the
complaint?you
refer
to
the
complaint?
the
complaint
also
doesn't
say
who
did
the
warning
but
just
says
after
being
warned
not
to
do
so.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so
from
the
standpoint
of
the
pleadings
going
back
to
the
point
which
we
have
been
discussing,
didn't
the
not
guilty
plea
put
an
issue
to
everything
that
the
complaint
alleged.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
must
you
prove
then
that
they
were
warned
and
in
fact
ordered
off
by
the
defendant
and
not
by
the
state
--
by
the
owner
and
not
by
the
state?
