but
on
the
law,
not
on
the

he
was
judge
--
yes,
but
that
was
referring
to
the
ordinance
rather
than
the

he's

justice
tom
c.

in
any
case,
you
have
the

putting
a

in
jail.
what

case
whether
it's
the
proprietor
doesn't
like
negroes
in
his
store
or
whether
the
city
ordinance
says
that
he
shan't
serve.
in
either
case
you
have
a
state
putting
a
man
in
prison
because
he
is
a
negro
shopping
in
a
certain
place,
isn't
that
right?

but
you
get
a

problem
when
you
go
