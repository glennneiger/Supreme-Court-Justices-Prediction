your
case
differs
from
the
other
then
and
that
as
i
understand
it,
if
the
restaurant
owner
could
not
have
chosen
to
serve
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
without
making
himself
a
violator
of
the
city
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that's
your
argument
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
certainly
in
this
case,
you
have
a
city
law
which
he
would've
violate
--
would've
violated
had
they
served
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
could
not
make
a
choice
of
their
own
free
will
but
that's
if
--
if
there'd
been
the
other
way
without
subjecting
in
there
the
prosecution
and
conviction
for
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
this
ordinance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
is
the
state
in
a
position
despite
all
that?
how
was
the
state
in
a
position
to
say
that
this
is
voluntary
action
of
an
owner
when
he'd
be
a
criminal
under
that
state
law
if
he
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
show
one
of
those
that
has
now
abandoned
the
old
type
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
in
that
group.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
just
said
immediately
before,
he
cannot
serve
them
there.
he
told
them
it
would
be
against
the
law
to
serve
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
davis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
suppose
that
any
merchant
in
birmingham
even
if
he
hadn't
been
there
as
long
as
he
possessed
the
store
there.
he
didn't
know
it
was
against
the
city
law
to
serve
white
and
colored
together.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
is
there
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
anybody
think
in
birmingham
just
live
there
and
knows
it
but
mr.
pizitz's
store
all
these
years
didn't
know
that
it
was
against
the
law
to
serve
them
together.
that
may
be
legal.
you
may
have
a
right
to
do
it
legally
but
how
could
anybody
be
assumed
not
to
know
it
when
it
was
on
the
books
and
that
--
when
its
been
the
practice
since
time
immemorial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you've
only
heard
of
it
being
enforced
because
it
was
obeyed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
certainly
it's
not
obeyed,
its
just
hadn't
been
(voice

--
justice

the
merchant
wouldn't
dare
to
break
it
even
if
he
wanted
to,
wouldn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
hadn't
been
a
merchant
running
a
restaurant,
merchants
running
a
restaurant
know
who
can
they
serve
and
who
they
can't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
it
(voice

but
they
hadn't
trespassed
after
warning.
they
would've
been

if
the
man
had
not
warned
them,
it
could've
been
against
the
law
from
--
to
go
in
there
and
sit
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
merchant
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
merchant
can't
be
put
at
the
risk
of
having
--
saying
that
maybe
they'll
hold
it
void
for
him
to
set
up
against
the
validation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
personally
do
not
see
how
in
this
case,
it's
possible
to
say
for
anybody
to
reach
a
conclusion
in
a
matter
of
this
importance
that
this
merchant
acted
because
he
wanted
to
rather
than
because
it
was
against
the
law.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
see
no
answer
to
that
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
i
see
a
great
difference.
i
don't
misunderstand
it.
i
see
a
great
difference
for
myself
when
a
merchant
deciding
he
doesn't
want
to
sell
to
somebody.
i
don't
care
what
the
ground
is.
deciding
he
won't
sell
them
and
not
sell
them.
and
having
a
law
that
tells
him
he
can't
sell
them
and
then
say,
“well,
because
of
his
own
choice
he
didn't
sell
them”.

justice

you
mean
not

these
are
cases,
are
they
not,
if
a

how
much?

$100.
justice

tried

justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that
--
what
is
required
as
i
understand
it,
it
used
to
be
was
that
the
state
or
the
city
proved
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
every
element
in
it.
one
element
if
you
were
trying
to
trespass
after
warning
would
be
rule
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
owner
of
his
own
choice
not
because
he
had
a
gun
in
his
bag
had
directed
the
man
to
leave,
so
that
would
be
an
issue
in
the
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice

we
are
not
guilty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
guilty
claims
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
ordinance
is
based
on
the
principle
i
suppose
that
he
was
ordered
by
the
owner
of
his
own
choice
with
his
own
knowledge
making
up
his
own
mind
not
to
stay
there,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
didn't
do
that?
supposed
you
have
to
charge
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
you
believe
from
the
evidence
in
this
case
on
the
plea
of
not
guilty.
do
you
believe
from
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
owner
did
not
himself
do
this
because
he
wanted
to
do
it
but
because
there
was
a
man
standing
behind
him
with
a
gun
in
his
bag?
they
asked
to
charge
it
then.
there
was
evidence
to
that
effect,
could
you
convict?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
could
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
could
convict
even
though
the
evidence
showed
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
the
man
had
a
gun
in
his
back
when
he
did
it
that
somebody
telling
him,
“you've
got
to
do
this”?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it's
the
same
thing
is
it
not,
always
been
recognized
if
the
law
tells
you
that
you
can't
do
something.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
assuming.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
assuming
that
the
state
has
to
show
that
they
acted
and
they
exercised
their
own
judgment
and
their
own
choice
in
ordering
him
to
get
out.
and
what
you
have
here
is
that
there's
a
law
standing
there,
they
have
them
in
debate
that
if
they
don't
order
them
to
get
out
there,
they'll
go
to
jail
themselves.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
get
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
true
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
every
allegation
but
that
doesn't
include
that
allegation
i
think
to
that
ordinance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
would
certainly
be
a
bad
ordinance
wouldn't
it
if
it
was
based
on
the
fact
that
the
owner
did
that
because
the
law
told
him
to.
that
would
be
a
bad
order,
wouldn't
it,
void?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
void?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
that
--
that's
an
essential
element
as
that
he
did
it
himself,
not
because
the
state
made
it,
i
would
think.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
(voice

justice

it
was

wasn't
it?
justice

may
i
ask
you
what
kind
of
special
plea
would
have
been
filed
to
raise
the
issue
of
that
--
this
man
did
not
do
this
because
of
his
own
choice
but
because
the
law
forced
him
to
do
it?
what
kind
of
plea?
i
--
probably
it's
been
changed
since
i
was
there,
that
i
do
not
recall.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
the
burden
of
proof
would
have
been
put
in
him
on
the
alabama
law
to
prove
that
the
man
actually
gave
the
order
of
his
own
choice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
you
are
saying
is
that
a
man
--
whether
the
man
did
it
because
the
law
compelled
him
to
do
it
or
whether
he
did
it
because
he
wanted
to,
it
would
be
immaterial
to
prove
any
crime.
justice

defensive
matter,
that
would
be
--
the
burden
would
be
put
on
him.
justice

have
you
cited
any
cases
to
that
effect
with
reference
to
(voice

justice

the
defendant

affirmatively
proving
on

that
which
is
an
essential

(voice

you
don't
plea
it
contributory

down
there
to
cases
where
the
people
had

justice

black
i
suppose
they'd
be
sent
to
jail
for
six
months.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought,
our
court
there
stopped
very
tenaciously
to
the
idea
that
the
business
of
government
whether
it's
a
city
or
state
to
prove
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
wouldn't
just
have
to
prove
that
he
shot
somebody.
you'd
have
to
prove
he
shot
him
with
malice
and
deliberate
--
deliberation
and
so
forth.
he
wouldn't
have
to
plead
any
of
that
would
he,
as
a
defendant?
justice
hugo

black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo

what
about
an
alibi,
does
he
have
to
plead
especially
an
alibi?
justice

black
well,
what
he
means
when
pleading
guilty
--
not
guilty
here
of
course
this
might
be
a
state
problem
but
i'm
just
interest
--
i
have
to
confess
my
interest
to
it,
what
he
is
charging
is,
i'm
not
guilty
of
--
he
may
say,
i'm
not
guilty
of
being
there.i'm
not
guilty
of
staying
there
or
you
may
say
i'm
not
guilty
of
staying
there
after
the
defendant
--
after
the
owner
of
the
property
because
he
wanted
to,
not
--
it's
not
because
the
state
made
him,
ordered
me
to
leave.
justice
hugo
l.

supposed
he'd
been
told
to
leave
by
a
man
who
came
in
from
the
street.
justice

of
course
it
was.

you
think
the

had
been

oh,
you
weren't

oh,
i
thought
you
were.
justice

black
well,
have
you
have
a
--
justice

the
elements
of
first
degree
murder
down
there
are
(inaudible)
--
premeditated
killing
with
malice
aforethought.
justice
hugo

black
do
you
mean
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
does
--
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
what's
the
inference
they
could
find
from
evidence
that
it
was
done
with
malice
aforethought
but
do
you
mean
that
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant
to
show
the
didn't
do

aforethought?
justice

all
of
these
--

if
it's
a
question

of
course,
it
maybe
too
far
from
this
but
if
--
but
i
have
as
to
the
--
if
it's
a
question
of
showing
and
it
was
done
with
deliberation
and
malice
forgetting
the
words
presumption,
the
court
always
charges
a
jury,
doesn't
it?you
must
find
from
the
evidence
that
he
did
it
deliberately
and
with
malice
aforethought
and
find
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
--
justice
hugo

black
--
without
regard
to
pleading.
justice
hugo
l.
black
my
--
i
would
like
to
come
back
if
i
could
to
my
question.
assuming
that
you
asked
for
those
to
file
a
special
plea
and
assuming
that
the
state's
proof
was
sufficient
to
withstand
the
motion
for
instructed
burden
of
not
guilty,
would
it
be
permissible
for
the
defendant
in
examining
--
in
putting
on
his
testimony
to
offer
the
proof
that
he
said
he
wanted
to
offer
with
reference
to
mr.
pizitz's
policy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
assuming
that
he
did
not
raise
it
by
plea
at
all
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
like
in
cases
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
he
was
supposed
to
raise
it.
the
law
required
him
to
raise
it,
you'll
say.
and
that
your
proof
or
the
state's
proof
was
sufficient
to
go
to
the
jury,
could
he
in
rebutting
your
proof
of
trespass
on
this,
i
guess
you
would
have
to
prove
that
it
was
a
trespass,
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
assuming
that
in
common
colloquy,
we
told
that
you
met
a
prima
facie
proof
in
a
civil
action.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
it's
not
any
such
thing
as
criminal
action.
and
you
went
--
you
were
able
to
go
to
the
jury
on
that.
could
he
request
that
prima
facie
proof
by
offering
proof
that
you
tendered
as
i
understand
it
on
page
25
that
mr.
pizitz
will
assume
had
no
such
policy
of
segregation
and
that
he
wanted
these
people
here,
indeed
he
has
indicted
them
to
come
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
suppose
he
didn't
plead
it.
justice
hugo
l.

the
evidence
wouldn't
be
admissible.
justice

the

justice

the
judge
didn't
go
off

ground.
he
said
it
was
immaterial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
pizitz's
policies
in
the
court
on
25,
mr.
pizitz's
policy
would
not
be
material
as
i
conceive
this.
that's
what
he
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that
were
true,
it
looks
like
to
me
that
he
would
have
said
that
you
didn't
plead
this
or
the
evidence
is
not
admissible.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
wouldn't
be
meeting
your
burden
of
showing
a
trespass.
i
wouldn't
be
trying
to
meet
your
burden
--
i
mean
trying
to
counteract
your
burden,
your
proof.
justice
hugo
l.

have
you
read
the
case
of
leland
versus
oregon.
do
you
happen
to
read
it
in
studying
this
case
where
we
held
up
the
question
as
to
whether
they
could
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
man
to
prove
insanity
in
the
court
--
majority
of
the
court
held
that
they
could
in
an
insanity
because
it
had
always
been
done
but
pointed
to
the
fact
that
this
court
have
held
that
this
government
--
federal
government
must
prove
every
essential
element
of
a
crime.
justice

black
you
think
that
--
there's
no
--
is
there
a
difference,
maybe
i
haven't
quite
understood.
is
there
a
difference
in
your
mind
the
pleadings
required

appeal
from

which
this
was,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
a
difference
in
your
mind
as
to
the
pleadings
a
defendant
is
required
to
put
in,
in
a
case
in
the
recorder's
court
where
he's
been
convicted
of
a
defense
like
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
the
rules
that
apply
if
he
was
charged
with
a
state
crime
or
misdemeanor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
that
because
i
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
that
he
has
also
proved
that
it
was
not
a
trespass
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
wouldn't
that
be
true
with
reference
truth
and
that
mr.
pizitz
did
not
want
them
to
leave.
he
was
acting
under
state's
requirement
of
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
what
i
mean,
they
offered
to
prove
as
i
understand
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
mean
just
in
meeting
your
burden.
your
burden
must
be
proved
that
there
was
a
trespass.
it
was
up
to
them
to
prove
there
wasn't
a
trespass.
that's
what
you
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
in
trying
to
prove
that
there
was
not
a
trespass,
it
would
have
been
appropriate
for
them
to
offer
proof
that
mr.
pizitz
instead
of
ordering
them
out
indeed
wanted
them
to
stay.
but
--
and
now
read
--
told
them
to
go
out
because
it
was
the
state
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
of
course,
practically
speaking,
i
suppose
it
would
be
from
a
--
was
on
a
persuasive
argument
against
construing
the
ordinance
in
such
a
way
that
the
guilt
or
innocent
could
be
determined
in
an
unknown
hidden
motive
which
prompted
the
man
to
give
the
order,
wouldn't
it?
that
is
--
that
couldn't
be
a
very
satisfactory
way,
was
it?
i'm
not
saying
that
you
haven't
advocated
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
thinking
about
that
as
a
rule
of
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
mean
is
this.
suppose
it
does
depend
on
--
so
as
you
have
to
prove
whether
he
did
it
for
one
reason
or
another.
the
only
way
you
could
do
that
would
be
to
prove
someway
of
what
was
in
his
mind
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
a
pretty
difficult
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
sometimes
the
law
resorts
to
that
but
not
unless
it
has
to
do,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
mean
that
in
--
i
think
maybe
it
does
that
in
criminal
cases
now,
what
they
call
criminal
state
cases,
they're
not
required
to
file
assignments
of
their
own.
i'm
sure
that's
true
with
capital
cases.
is
that
the
distinction
that
this
opinion
is
drawing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
this
is
appeal
from
the
recorder's
court,
they're
not
required
to
assign
error?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
argued
in
the
brief.
