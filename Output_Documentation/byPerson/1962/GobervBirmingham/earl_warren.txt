do
you
require

but
do
you

yes,
but
do
require
pleadings?

chief

earl
warren
well,
its
criminal
when
you
go
to
jail,
isn't
it?
a
violation
of
the
law
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
not
criminal
law
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
effect
does
a
plea
of
not
guilty
have?
what
issues
does
it
brace?
chief

in

case
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
a
case
of
this
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
can
enter,
yes,
but
what
issues
can
be
raised
under
the
plea
of
not
guilty.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
your
position
that
the
federal
questions
were
not
adequately
raised
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
consider
--
you
may
finish
that
answer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
you
may
continue
your
arguments.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we've
had
a
good
many
of
these
sit-in
cases
where
the
police
did
initiate
it
and
we
had
to
reverse
it
for
that
reason.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
it
is
a
mesmerism,
that's
a
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
if
in
your
--
if
in
your
brief,
you
have
cited
the
statute
which
compels
a
special
pleading
in
this
case
to
raise
these
questions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
in
your
brief
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
it's
in
your
brief,
that's
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
isn't
an
ordinance.
this
is
a
state
law,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
yes,
yes,
i
remember.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
you
cite
your
alabama
code
1940,
title
vii,
section
225
and
you
quote
as
follows
-
“the
defendant
may
plead
more
pleas
than
one
without
unnecessary
repetitions.
and
if
he
does,
not
rely
solely
on
a
denial
of
the
various
cause
of
action.
it
must
plead
especially
the
matter
of
defense”.
now
that
sounds
to
me
more
like
a
civil
proceeding
than
a
criminal
proceeding
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
this
specifically
apply
to
criminal
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
civil
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
--
is
there
any
case
that
holds
that
this
are
--
these
civil
rules
apply
to
criminal
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
one
case
that
you
cite?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
can
we
find
any
discussion
in
any
cases
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
or
in
any
textbooks
on
the
requirement
to
file
special
pleas
in
criminal
cases
in
your
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
criminal
cases,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
don't
you
cite
them
in
your
brief
instead
of
citing
this
as
a
general
language
such
as
there
is
in
25
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
the
only
time
that
such
thing
has
been
discussed
in
the
history
of
alabama?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
is
because
you
call
it
a
quasi
criminal
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i
was
wondering
because
justice
black
was
asking
you
about
a
first
degree
murder
case
and
you
said
that
there,
there
would
have
to
be
a
special
pleading.
so
is
that
under
the
civil
rules
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
set
of
rules
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
davis,
suppose
you
had
a
simple
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon
case
and
the
state
proved
that
the
defendant
used
a
wrench
let's
say
and
assaulted
a
person
with
it
and
then
arrested.
that
would
incorporate
all
the
things
that
are
ordinarily
necessary
in
order
to
prove
an
assault
with
deadly
weapon,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
do
--
if
the
--
suppose
if
the
defendant
wants
to
prove
self-defense,
is
he
obliged
under
your
law
to
file
a
special
pleading?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
these
rules
make
a
distinction
between
writing
and
orally?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
didn't
you
differentiate
between
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
don't
you
get
right
back
the
same
thing
here
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
will
you
prove
that
he
was
told
to
leave
and
he
doesn't
leave?
he
says
there
was
a
reason
other
than
a
lawful
reason
as
to
why
this
man
put
me
off
his
property?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
equivalent?
you
said
a
little
while
back
that
it
was
equivalent
criminal
contributory
negligence.
well
now,
why
isn't
that
just
as
much
a
plea
under
the
general
issue
as
self-defense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
fine.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well
mr.
davis.

justice

warren
