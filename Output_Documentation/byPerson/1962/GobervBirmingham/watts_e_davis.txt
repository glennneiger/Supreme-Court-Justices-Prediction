mr.
watts
e.
davis
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
if
i
might
clarify
one
or
two
items
that
have
just
gotten
into
this
matter,
we've
been
discussing
here
the
unusual
circumstances
of
the
court's
ruling
and
i
think
simply
it
was
a
slip
of
the
tongue.
you'll
notice
mr.
hall
and
the
judge
have
been
discussing
this
matter
from
page
24
through
26.
and
i
think
the
judge
forgot
the
frame
of
the
court
--
the
form
of
the
question
of
the
objection
at
this
point.
it
was
simply
going
along
with
the
thing
and
overruling.
when
he
says
overrule,
i
think
he
means
the
“overrule”
is
a
general
approach
to
this
thing
that
you're
getting
into
the
surrounding
or
--
irrelevant
matters.
but
another
thing
that
i
want
to
mention
before
i
go
into
what
i
had
in
mind,
addressing
the
court
on
is
the
propositions
that
counsel
has
said
apparently
they
were
willing
to
tolerate
this
condition.
and
i
believe
in
briefs,
they
mentioned
the
proposition
of
economic
give
and
take.
and
i
might
throw
this
question
out
for
an
answer
if
they
desire
to
answer
it.
why
would
the
storeowners
have
turned
out
the
lights
if
they
want
them
to
sit
there
and
tolerate
this?
why
did
they
ask
them
to
leave
if
they
were
willing
to
tolerate
this?
why
did
they
say
we
cannot
serve
you
here
if
they're
willing
to
tolerate
it?
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
that
page
24,
mr.
justice
black,
and
follow
that
if
we
may
of
the
language,
the
comptroller,
both
pizitz
--
i
believe
his
name
is
mr.
gotlinger
who
was
testifying
at
the
time
and
this
was
cross-examination.
and
mr.
hall
is
asking
mr.
gotlinger,
what
some
other
person
said?
what
mr.
pizitz,
dick
pizitz,
the
assistant
--
i
believe
the
assistant
of
the
president.
he
said,
“what
did
he
tell
them?”
he
told
them,
“they
couldn't
serve
there
and
we
had
facilities
in
the
basement
to
serve
them”.
he
told
them
that
it
would
be
against
the
law
to
serve
them
there.
he
told
them
it
would
be
against
the
law
to
serve
them
there.
what
law
did
he
have
in
mind,
do
you
know?
answer
-
i
don't
know.
question
-
he
didn't
say
it
was
against
the
(inaudible)
policy
to
serve
them
there
and
this
is
the
key.
he
used
the
term
we
cannot
serve
you
here.
question
-
and
you
assumed
that
he
meant
it
that
it
was
against
the
law?
i
assumed
that.
so
all
of
these
there
is
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
mr.
justice
black,
it's
my
sincere
thought
on
this
matter
that
the
ordinance
never
comes
in
to
the
thought
process.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
can
make
a
confession
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
of
course
i'll
say
this,
i
believe
there
are
some
40
odd
years
and
i
have
never
heard
of
it
being
enforced.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
that's
a
possibility.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
but
i
think
it
was
obeyed
long
before
it
became
an
ordinance.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
i
think
it
goes
back
to
the
question
of
which
comes
first,
the
chicken
or
the
egg.wasn't
that
the
custom
existing
at
the
time
the
ordinance
went
into
effect
so
there
was
no
occasion
for
any
change.
but
i
would
say
this
to
his
honor
and
i'm
a
little
bit
ashamed
to
admit
it,
i
was
only
with
the
city
attorney's
office
a
few
months
when
this
case
came
up.
i
didn't
know
there
was
such
an
ordinance
on
that
book
and
i
didn't
think
there
was
and
when
mr.
hall
got
into
this
question,
he'd
been
shooting
constitutional
objections
in
every
direction.
i
thought
this
was
another
one
of
these
generalized
objections
that
segregation
was
an
issue.
he
had
no
city
code
on
his
hand.
he
was
citing
it
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
let's
get
back
if
i
may
to
the
basic
question
that
i
think
is
basic
in
this
question
--
in
this
whole
controversy.
first,
what
were
the
issues
in
this
case?
we
filed
a
complaint
charging
one
thing
that
they
trespassed
after
warning.
they
concede
that
in
each
case
the
evidence
shows
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
--
that
they
didn't.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
we
have
a
void
ordinance
which
we
concede
is
void.
i've
never
known
of
the
thing
--
a
case
yet
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
--
before
(inaudible)
come
in.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
i
think
there
is
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
mr.
justice
black,
my
answer
to
that
is
this.
you
of
course
are
familiar
with
the
locality
of
birmingham
and
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
you
know
that
there's
an
abundance
of
attorneys
down
in
the
city
of
birmingham
and
notwithstanding
this
whole
expression
you
can't
fight
city
hall.
you
know
that
many
of
them
down
there
do
fight
city
hall
and
if
they
wanted
to
for
a
moment
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
on
this
issue?
mr.
watts
e.
davis
no
sir,
but
many
others
and
if
the
merchant
wanted
to
bring
this
thing
ahead
and
see
what
their
rights
were,
well
i
think
it
would've
been
very
long
ago.
but
again,
i
think
it
goes
back
to
the
question
that
custom
preceded
the
ordinance
and
the
ordinance
didn't
bring
on
any
occasion
whereby
they
should
change
that
custom
but
we
concede
that
the
ordinance
was
invalid
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
--
theres
no
issue
on
that.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
oh,
30
days
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
no
sir.
i
don't
think
so.
he's
put
in
jail
because
he
trespassed
after
he
was
told
he
was
not
to
remain
there
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
--
which
he
actually
admit,
which
(voice
overlap).
mr.
watts
e.
davis
but
--
what
the
point
is,
and
i
don't
think
we
have
yet
touched
the
basic
point
in
that
in
the
city
of
birmingham's
case.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
very
definitely.
i
think
there
are
some
factual
differences
certainly.
but
as
far
as
the
law
and
the
powers
out
of
the
constitution
are
concerned,
we
think
private
property
is
private
property
whether
it's
in
your
home,
whether
it's
in
your
office
or
whether
it's
in
a
small
store
or
big
store.
but
the
prime
question
that
i
think
is
of
importance
for
this
case
is,
what
were
the
issues?
mr.
watts
e.
davis
no
sir.
i
construe
the
constitution
as
a
limitation
of
power
and
not
some
affirmative
instrument
to
use
to
do
positive
things
but
a
limitation
upon
the
states
not
to
give
anybody
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
--
positive
power.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
some
people
use
the
word
segregation,
some
use
the
expression
of
racial
discrimination.
i
prefer
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes,
i
further
think
that
racial
discrimination
of
a
different
sense,
racial
choice
or
racial
selectivity.
i
know
that
an
irish
man
prefer
irish
man
or
at
least
i've
heard
that,
i'm
not
irish.
i
know
there's
a
chinese
community
in
our
hometown.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
no
sir.
i
don't
think
its
prejudice.
it's
a
personal
taste.
i'm
told
by
responsible
neighbors,
they
have
segregation
among
themselves
in
our
city.
you
say
--
some
people
have
feeling,
i
think
that
the
negroes
don't
prosper
in
the
south.
well,
i
can
assure
this
court
in
my
hometown
they
have
beautiful
residential
districts
and
i
feel
right
ashamed
when
i
see
some
of
their
cadillac's,
new
ones
and
i
have
a
10-year-old
automobile.
that's
the
rule
and
not
the
exception
to
the
rule
that
i
make
to
this
court.
but
the
issue
we're
getting
out
here
is
how
was
this
case
tried
out
in
the
state
court?
to
me,
it
was
just
another
lawsuit.
we
filed
a
complaint
saying,
“well,
you
didn't
leave
when
you
were
asked
to”.
trespass
after
warning,
a
simple
city
ordinance.
they
came
along
and
they
filed
a
motion
to
strike
the
complaint.
supreme
court
decided
authority
and
two
cases
have
been
in
this
court,
one
is
(inaudible)
versus
birmingham
and
the
other,
taylor
versus
birmingham.
a
motion
to
strike
in
this
type
of
action
which
is
a
quasi
civil
action
does
not
serve
the
purpose
to
attack
the
validity
or
the
sufficiency
of
the
complaint.
they
don't
say
that
it
does.
they
--
haven't
taken
an
issue
with
that
proposition.
the
motion
to
strike
went
out
the
window
whether
they
come
along
with
the
next,
to
set
demurs
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
in
alabama
said
two
things,
first,
they
were
all
general
and
we
have
a
code
section,
this
issue
must
file
a
specific
demurs
specified
forth
in
the
complaint
you're
objecting
to
and
not
be
general.
the
court
of
appeals
said
every
one
of
those
were
general.
in
addition
to
that,
they
raised
certain
constitutional
objections,
they
said,
“as
applied
to
this
defendant,
this
press
--
this
ordinance
does
so
and
so
and
so”.
well,
the
court
said,
“that
was
a
speaking
demurrer
because
it
required
evidence”.
it
didn't
appear
on
his
face
how
it
was
going
to
affect
a
particular
defendant.
they
took
evidence.
that
was
a
speaking
demurrer.
they
haven't
denied
that
that
was
--
or
claimed
that
that
was
an
erroneous
ruling.
so
what
do
we
normally
come
to
than
a
plea
of
general
issue?
there
they
trespassed
after
warning.
isn't
that
the
only
question
we
had
in
the
trial
court?
we're
charged
they
did,
they
say,
“we
didn't.”
now
they
come
along
and
say
all
but
the
city
was
negative
state
action.
under
what
theory
are
we
required
to
make
it
if
anything?
they
drew
the
boundary
lines
in
this
dispute.
they
didn't
file
a
form
or
any
special
plea.
they
brought
up
nothing
of
that
nature
that
the
court
could
adjudicate.
this
court
in
hill
versus
mendenhall,
about
--
in
88
u.s.,
announced
the
fundamental
question
of
pleadings,
pleadings
apprise
the
party
on
the
court
of
the
facts
and
issue,
the
court
that
it
may
declare
the
law
in
the
parties
that
they
may
know
what
to
meet
by
their
proof.
and
here,
we're
sitting
here
with
the
general
issue
to
how
they
say,
“well,
you
can
take
judicial
notice”.
they're
asking
the
lower
court
to
act
as
counsel.
when
they
say
that
--
judicial
notice
is
not
a
substitute
for
pleading
if
i
may
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir,
but
these
are
quasi
civil.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
pardon?
i
think
its
quasi
criminal
but
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
mr.
breckenridge
was
saying,
this
is
case
is
quasi
criminal
and
you
asked
the
question
what
pleadings
are
required
in
criminal
cases.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
not
under
the
alabama
decisions
interpreting
these
matters
your
honor.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
pardon
sir?
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
a
hundred
dollars.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
$100
and
180
days.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
don't
contend
that
they're
not
penal.
they're
punished.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
under
the
supreme
court
decision
in
the
state
of
alabama,
they
are
quasi
criminal.
the
rules
of
civil
proceedings
apply
on
appeal.
your
civil
rules
apply.
they
must
assign
error
and
argue
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
hear
it
on
the
supreme
court.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
the
general
issue
is
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
--
they
didn't
do
it.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
they
didn't
do
it.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
oh,
the
question
that
they
didn't
do
the
act
complained
of
then
the
complaint
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
if
it
were
brought
up
by
a
plea
or
a
defense
what
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
if
i
may
say
this,
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
you're
going
in
--
to
watch
the
defense
to
this
trespass
saying
all
we're
involved
is,
it
is
proving
that
he
did
put
the
ordinance
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
--
that
says
you
must
not
do.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
i
would
assume
that
someone
wants
to
tell
him
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
pardon?
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
think
once
you
prove
the
simple
fact,
he
was
told
to
leave
the
premises
and
didn't
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
--
the
state
has
carried
its
burden
and
then
the
defense
takes
over.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
you
have
to
tell
him
to
get
off
the
premises?
mr.
watts
e.
davis
no
sir
that
would
not
be
a
voluntary
act.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
you're
assuming
of
course
that
they
acted
under
this
invalid
law
and
i
am
assuming
that
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
(inaudible)
we
hadn't
filed
a
charge.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
as
i
interpret
your
honor's
question
or
statement,
it
looks
like
that
the
state
in
prosecuting
any
case,
somebody
shoot
somebody
else,
they
don't
have
to
show
that
it
--
they
voluntarily
did
it,
they're
going
to
have
to
show
that
they
were
not
insane
that
the
state
has
got
the
negative
ever
defensive
element.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
but
this
is
purely
defensive
i
think
what
is
on
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
oh,
the
allegation
simply
says
that
he
failed
to
refuse
after
being
warned
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
i
think
the
ordinance
is
telling
he's
got
to
make
that
election
as
bad
and
void,
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
and
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
if
that
were
the
law
that
in
every
case
and
i'm
not
a
prosecutor
that
you
probably
guess,
i'm
a
land
attorney
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
--
in
the
city
of
birmingham.
but
i
don't
think
the
law
places
any
burden
on
the
prosecution
to
come
along
in
negative
every
possible
defense
it
may
creep
into
a
situation.
as
i
see
this,
this
is
a
defensive
matter
and
you'll
notice
in
the
discussion
plea,
mr.
hall
and
the
court
--
mr.
hall
says
first,
“that
if
the
had
not
gone
in
to
pizitz's
store
and
mrs.
pizitz
have
not
told
them
to
get
out
the
store”,
and
that's
on
page
24
and
25.
he
says,
“we
wouldn't
be
here”.
and
the
court
says,
“well,
is
there
any
(inaudible)
between
you
and
the
city
on
this?”
in
other
words
if
pizitz
hadn't
told
them
to
get
out,
well,
they
wouldn't
have
been
prosecuted
and
he
says,
“i
don't
know”.
then
the
court
says
this,
“in
the
issue
in
this
thing
whether
they
trespassed
after
warning”.
and
he
said,
“i
think
so
mr.
hall”,
the
petition
for
counsel
--
counsel
for
petitioners.
then
the
court
says
one
other
thing,
“well,
isn't
that
issue,
isn't
that
the
thing
that
you
mean?”
and
what
did
he
say,
“it
certainly
is
your
honor”.
so
how
could
we
be
more
doubly
sure
of
what
we're
trying
in
this
case?
what
the
issues
were?
how
we
were
to
fix
the
boundary
lines
of
the
dispute
and
not
only
by
the
pleadings
but
by
the
admission
of
the
counsel
himself
that
the
boundary
lines
are
--
is
--
has
there
been
a
trespass
committed?
isn't
that
the
issue?
isn't
that
the
thing
which
is
the
main
--?
mr.
watts
e.
davis
pardon
sir?
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
oh,
very
definitely,
very
definitely.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
it's
a
matter
that
he
had
searched.
he
has
that
burden
of
proceeding
with
it
at
least.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
it
is
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
but
may
i
say
this
at
this
point?
they
have
cited
the
thompson
versus
louisville
case
and
of
course
the
garner
case
and
we
would
like
to
join
them
in
citing
those
two
cases.
the
rule
that
this
court
enunciated
and
as
i
recall
correctly
in
garner
was
that
the
test
is
not
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
before
the
trial
court
but
whether
there
was
any
evidence
before
the
trial
court.
they
concede
the
evidence
is
positive
in
each
case.
the
employee
of
a
store
ordered
them
the
premises.
so
we
have
no
issue
there
really.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
no,
it
was
not
argued.
it's
mentioned
in
the
court's
opinion
that
they
had
five
assignments
of
error
which
they
must
--
if
they
had
to
rely
on
them,
assigned
as
error
and
argued.
the
fifth,
what
it
was,
some
question
about
evidence.
i
believe
it
was
in
the
evidence
sufficed
the
prejudice,
that's
my
recollection
but
it
appears
in
each
case,
the
assignment
of
errors.
but
they
didn't
even
argue
that.
they
didn't
argue
any
question
of
evidence,
whatever
in
the
case.
they
simply
argued
that
demonstrations
were
--
that
there
were
demonstrations,
there
were
symbols
of
communications
or
symbols
of
something
rather.
and
if
you
know,
the
court
took
off
on
one
or
two
of
those
arguments.
but
the
only
thing
they
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
the
overruling
of
the
--
and
they
didn't
argue
this,
they've
cited
this
error.
you're
reeling
a
motion
to
strike
complaint
that
emerged
and
they
file
this
motion
to
exclude
the
evidence,
a
motion
for
new
trial.
and
that
--
unless
this
motion
excludes
the
evidence,
may
i
say
this,
this
question
of
state
action
gets
into
it.
if
you'll
notice,
there
are
8
grounds,
grounds
2,
3,
4,
7,
and
8
say
this
if
i
may
point
out
to
the
court
and
invite
your
attention
to
them.
i
think
on
page
6
you'll
find
the
first
one
in
the
gober
case
(inauidble).
in
five
of
those
grounds,
they
say
it's
not
the
policy
of
the
city
of
birmingham
or
the
state
of
alabama.
they
say
it's
the
policy
of
the
customer
and
the
usage
of
(inaudible)
or
whatever
particular
department
store
was
involved
that
has
deprived
them
of
their
fourteenth
amendment
yearns.
the
other
three
grounds,
they
don't
attribute
to
fall
through
--
direct
in
accusing
things
as
to
anyone
but
that
simply
was
a
confirmation
as
i
view
it
and
what
the
simple
issue
was
in
the
trial
court
in
the
first
place,
did
they
or
didn't
they
trespass
after
somebody
told
them
to
get
off
the
premises.
and
we
had
no
other
question
and
they
didn't
bring
that
up
until
they
got
to
this
court.
but
the
local
counsel,
there
were
five
of
them
who
were
experts
in
this
matter.
you
will
notice
that
motion
to
exclude
the
evidence
five
times
of
the
eight
grounds
they
assert.
it
says
it
was
the
policy
of
the
store
or
the
policy
custom
in
usage
of
the
store,
or
the
custom
or
the
preponderant
number
of
department
stores
in
the
city
of
birmingham
that
deprived
them
of
their
rights.
so
we
were
not
arguing
any
constitutional
issues
in
this
thing.
but
since
they
brought
them
up,
i
think
right
here,
the
local
counsels
directs
them
to
the
policy
of
the
stores
themselves
as
confessed
with
the
state
and
the
city.
it
fairly
--
clearly
answers
the
question.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
not
raised
at
all
sir.
well,
adequately
perhaps
is
a
better
way
to
put
it
but
in
the
demurrers
they
were
not
properly
raised
in
a
motion
to
strike,
that
doesn't
even
lie
and
there
had
been
two
cases
from
alabama
for
this
court,
the
(inaudible)
versus
birmingham
and
taylor
versus
birmingham
where
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
denied
that's
involved.
and
then
after
the
evidence
was
taken
now
we
went
to
issue
on
that
several
question.
after
the
evidence
was
there
and
they
come
along
and
filed
a
motion
to
exclude
the
evidence
never
suggesting
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
in
any
way.
they
simply
say
the
evidence
shows
that
these
stores
were
exercising
these
policies.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
i
recall
that
in
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
which
ground?
please
sir,
you
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
would
not
think
so.
the
case
had
already
been
tried
at
this
point
your
honor.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
constant
reference,
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
they
were
constantly
referring
to
constitutional
proposition
but
not
once
did
they
come
in
with
a
formal
plea
or
a
special
plea
as
this
court
has
said
in
the
mendenhall
--
hill
versus
mendenhall.
how
would
any
lawyer
know
how
to
prepare
a
case
if
they
were
not
to
have
pleadings?
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
thank
you
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
one
other
question
which
was
injected
into
the
controversy
here
and
i
say
here
because
i
respect
to
submit
it
was
never
injected
under
the
controversy
in
the
state
courts.
was
this
question
a
police
action?
as
i
mentioned
earlier
in
alabama,
you
assigned
to
their
appellate
courts
your
errors
that
you
wish
the
court
to
consider.
now
the
supreme
court
rules
specifically
state
that
if
you
don't
assign
them
or
don't
argue
them
they
won't
consider
those
grounds.
but
these
acts
considered
--
are
injected
into
the
thing
by
appellate
counsel
and
not
by
a
local
counsel
in
the
state
courts.
but
it
has
been
injected
under
the
thing
here
which
i
don't
think
it's
a
proper
forum
for
it
without
the
court
having
first
had
a
chance
to
rule
on
it.
they
bring
up
the
question
how
the
arrest
were
effectuated
and
brought
about.
again,
i
say
that
the
plea
was
a
simple
general
denial.
had
we
known
that
this
was
one
of
the
channels
that
they
wanted
to
proceed
on
by
the
pleadings
then
we
would
have
brought
the
police
records
to
court?
we
could
have
mastered
up
the
complaint
records.
we
could
have
looked
for
witnesses
to
say
or
to
find
out
who
made
this
report
to
the
police.
the
police
didn't
come
there
through
some
form
of
mesmerism.
someone
initiated
this
thing
but
it
was
not
upon
us
to
explain
that
situation
under
a
simple
general
issue
in
this
matter.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
i
think
that
would
be
the
problem,
right.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
think
that
would
be
a
proper
action.
but
i
think
this
that
we've
got
to
try
the
case
within
the
framework
of
the
pleadings.
we
can't
shoot
mugshot
in
every
direction
and
hope
one
will
hit
here
and
one
will
hit
there.
going
back
to
your
hill
versus
mendenhall
case,
the
fundamental
principle
of
pleadings
is
to
define
the
issue
so
the
court
may
declare
the
law
and
the
parties
may
know
what
to
meet
by
their
proof
and
agreement.
but
in
any
event,
the
petitioners
themselves,
elicited
from
the
officers
who
were
testifying
that
for
us
who's
in
possessed,
when
the
arresting
officer
arrived,
he
or
his
superior
is
talking
with
people
in
the
store
presumably
witnesses
who
had
seen
this
thing,
getting
information
and
they
directed
the
arresting
officer
to
make
the
arrest.
they
brought
it
out
also
that
in
laughlin's,
one
of
the
officers
through
cross-examination,
one
of
his
superior
officers
have
been
told
that
two
of
these
volunteers
have
been
told
to
leave
and
refused.
so
it
--
there
was
a
duty
on
him
to
make
an
arrest.
an
ordinance
had
been
violated.
and
in
the
case
of
(inaudible)
they
--
i
think
as
they
have
brought
it
out
in
the
trial
court,
mrs.
evans,
the
(inaudible)
manager
told
the
officer
she
had
told
the
two
boys
to
leave
and
they
refused
and
that
in
his
presence
she
told
them.
so
in
the
presence
of
the
officer,
the
offense
was
committed.
but
i
say
again
and
i
hope
the
court
would
adhere
to
its
rulings.
it
has
adopted
in
the
past
that
these
matters
which
are
not
before
a
state
court
will
not
come
up
here
for
a
first
hearing.
in
other
words,
not
let
them
come
here
to
try
the
case.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir,
its
title
vii.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
and
it
relates
to
civil
cases
and
i
also
spell
out
that
these
are
quasi
criminal
cases
that
all
your
rules
of
evidence
that
which
apply
in
civil
cases
apply
in
quasi
criminal
cases
to
appellate
rules
that
apply
into
civil
cases
apply
in
quasi
criminal
cases.
it
is
a
civil
proceeding.
now
the
court
of
alabama
whether
rightly
or
wrongly
is
held
that
an
offense
against
the
city
ordinance
does
not
rise
for
the
dignity
of
a
crime
whether
that
is
its
philosophy
in
this
matter,
i
don't
know.
they
don't
go
into
it.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
this
is
a
city
ordinance
they
were
prosecuted
on
this.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
city
of
birmingham's
ordinance.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
but
in
any
event,
this
court
have
said
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
(voice
overlap)
mr.
watts
e.
davis
pardon
sir?
mr.
watts
e.
davis
it's
the
code
section
in
volume
--
in
title
vii.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
but
it
is
title
vii
and
i
think
its
235,
let's
see
--
court
of
alabama,
225.
i
copied
a
portion
of
it
on
page
5
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
or
at
least
i
make
a
reference
to
it
at
that
point.
i
think
it's
in
shuttlesworth
case
perhaps
it
was
that
i
copied
part
of
it.
but
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
he
went
into
the
policy
of
other
stores,
i
recall
and
i
think
the
government
suggested
that
is
being
tantamount
to
an
attempted
to
show
the
city
ordinance.
i
made
the
objection
that
the
policy
of
the
other
stores
would
not
be
involved.
he
was
going
not
in
birmingham
where
this
case
came
up
but
into
other
areas
and
i
think
the
courts
there
it
was
and
perhaps
erroneously
i
won't
comment
on
it,
that
policy
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
believe
he
said,
aren't
we
trying
--
a
question
here
whether
he
violated
this
ordinance.
but
i
think
they
brought
nothing
before
the
court
in
the
nature
of
a
formal
plea
to
suggest
these
things.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
it
would
just
be
a
plea
setting
up
affirmatively
these
defensive
matters
for
that
they
exist
in
the
city
of
birmingham,
an
ordinance
that
define
this
section
so
and
so
and
that
it
was
in
compliance
with
this
ordinance
as
the
storeowner
operate
--
made
this
request
to
leave
or
direct
them
to
leave.
and
so
we'll
put
it
in
issue.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
don't
conceive
the
choice
is
an
issue.
the
ordinance
says,
if
a
man
tells
you
to
get
off
his
property,
you
must
leave.
if
you
don't,
you
violate
the
ordinance.
if
that's
the
ordinance
as
your
honor
is
thinking
of.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
what's
the
defensive
matter,
may
i
submit?
mr.
watts
e.
davis
that's
right
sir.
but
he
hasn't
even
put
it
in
issue.
irrespective
of
whose
burden
it
is,
it's
not
even
an
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
cite
a
case
to
this
court.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
cited
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
your
honor
perhaps
i
made
this
mistake.
i
assume
that
it
was
not
a
question
for
the
state.
to
me,
it's
something
to
a
plea
of
contributory
negligence.
i
assume
this
your
honor
on
a
theory
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
--
an
enemy.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
no,
what
i'm
--
speaking
of
the
same
general
situation.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
no
sir,
but
basically
you
have
the
affirmative
matter
and
defensive
matter.
you're
the
defendant
in
this
thing
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
proved
that
he
committed
the
act
charged.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
i
don't
know
but
i
am
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
don't
know
that
i'm
a
100%,
the
court
decided
on
that
proposition
though
it's
not
exactly
the
question
here.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
no
sir,
because
he
pleads
not
guilty
which
means
i
didn't
do
it
and
if
i
can
show
that
i
was
somewhere
else
at
the
time
then
certainly
the
jury
can
assume
using
his
common
experience
as
a
common
sense
but
if
he
was
somewhere
else
he's
sure
didn't
do
it.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
our
position
is
that
he
simply
says,
“i'm
not
guilty
of
what
you
say
i
did”.
now
we
say
he
did
on
--
there
were
two
elements
to
what
we
say
he
did.
number
one,
he
was
on
the
premises,
he
was
told
to
leave.
but
number
two,
he
refused
to
leave.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
they
don't
say
that
that
was
a
fact.
they
concede
that
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
--
before
he
did
it.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
think
i
mentioned
in
my
brief
that
if
that
situation
existed,
i
didn't
feel
like
the
ordinance
had
been
violated.
but
again
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
would
not
think
so
and
i
mentioned
that
in
my
brief.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
i
said
that
in
my
brief.
i
didn't
think
it
can
be
violated
but
they
make
no
such
contention
in
this
case.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
it
is
--
we
might
suppose
that
that
particular
code
section
applies
by
its
own
language
to
civil
cases.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
in
our
brief,
we
have
developed
its
application
to
this
case.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
rules
of
evidence.
we
don't
have
a
whole
field
of
law
on
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
not
--
no
sir.
no
sir.
but
under
even
criminal
law
if
you
wanted
to
come
in
and
say
the
defendant
was
insane,
you
would
put
it
in
a
plea
of
insanity.
but
if
you
want
to
plea
there
was
an
involuntary
act
where
he's
charged
with
perhaps
murder,
you
want
to
show
this
involuntary
act.
you'd
have
to
show
something.
you
admittedly
did
it,
it's
more
like
a
confession
and
avoidance,
really.
you
admit
you
did
the
act
that
say
you
did
what?
and
then
we
avoid
the
act
even
in
criminal
law.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
that
this
happens
to
fall
in
a
civil
case.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
that's
right
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
it's
presumed
from
the
homicide
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
of
course,
the
burden
is
on
him,
yes
sir.
well,
i'd
say
this
is
a
presumption.
when
i
throw
a
weapon
and
i
fired
it
to
the
man,
they
don't
have
to
go
beyond
that
and
say,
“oh,
but
in
his
heart,
his
heart
was
black,
he
intended
to
do
it”,
while
the
evidence
speaks
for
itself
but
if
i
want
to
show
that
somebody
dropped
me
with
something
or
has
turned
me
into
a
pinch
of
insanity
through
some
process,
i
would
come
along
and
set
that
up
as
a
defense
but
certainly
the
state
isn't
going
to
say
that
all
of
these
various
defenses
didn't
happen
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
--
because
they
would
never
their
case.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
think
that's
(inaudible)
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
think
that's
even
in
the
indictment,
yes
sir.
so
i
think
they
have
to
--
they
generally
will
show
some
motive
involved
with
it.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
assuming
that
it
was
a
proper
form
of
plea
or
injected
in
to
--
that
in
a
proper
issue,
i
think
so.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir,
assuming
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
that
he
remained
after
he
was
warned
to
leave.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
think
if
he
of
course
have
put
it
in
a
form
of
a
plea
or
any
pleading
as
to
it.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
no
sir.
then
i
quoted
to
it.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i'm
certain
not
in
alabama.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
what
he
said
was
as
i
understood
it,
it
was
that
the
witness
who
was
an
employee
of
a
store,
his
knowledge
of
the
law
was
not
competent
really
and
later
on
he
(voice
overlap)
material.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
i
think
the
court
was
right
in
this
particular
instance
where
it
was
not
made
an
issue
and
they
had
the
right
to
drew
up
the
boundary
lines
on
this
dispute.
they
have
(inaudible)
--
they
had
been
in
more
of
these
cases
than
i
have.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
no
sir.
we
only
had
two
elements
to
prove.
one,
they
were
told
to
leave
and
two,
they
refused
and
the
only
burden
on
the
state
--
on
the
city.
because
they
didn't
file
any
plea
--
they
filed
all
sorts
of
other
things,
very
extensive
pleadings
but
elected
to
go
to
issue
on
the
general
denial.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
in
criminal
cases.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
your
honor,
we
have
in
the
code,
forms
of
pleas
to
file
any
criminal
cases.
i
think
they
assume
that
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
i
stopped
to
the
civil
rules
which
we
contend
that
this
case
comes
under
it
and
the
court
of
appeals
cited
cases.
it's
in
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court,
(inaudible)
versus
state,
that
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
no
sir.
i've
cited
two
cases
this
morning
where
on
appeal,
your
civil
rules
apply
(inaudible)
versus
state
came
to
this
court
on
petition
for
certiorari.
senator
glen
taylors
case
versus
city
of
birmingham
came
to
this
court.
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
denied.
but
it
said
in
all
of
those
cases,
these
things
follow
civil
rules
in
alabama,
civil
rules.
they
had
another
case
before
this
one
that
came
to
this
court
where
the
civil
rules
in
the
record
that
didn't
get
to
certain
questions
(inaudible)
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
i
never
have
really
liked
the
word
quasi
criminal,
how
much
is
quasi?
i
don't
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
no
sir,
i'm
sure
not.
i
think
you
cannot
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
--
under
said
common
law
rule
under
the
same
rule
enunciated
by
an
earlier
court
hearing
in
hill
versus
mendenhall
that
--
the
part
of
is
that
it
would
be
applied
in
what
the
issues
are.
the
courts
got
to
know
it.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
i
think
we
must
prove
every
essential
element
of
the
fact.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
think
generally,
the
same
rule
is
applied
but
the
courts
have
specifically
stated
that
these
cases
are
a
quasi
criminal
case.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
agree
with
you
despite
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
i
don't
see
but
two
basic
differences
in
making
a
quasi
criminal
and
not
civil.
one
is
that
in
civil,
of
course,
the
motion
exclude
the
evidence
won't
apply
it,
must
be
a
motion
for
the
affirmative
charge.
there's
another
time
at
the
time,
it
slipped
through
my
mind
but
there's
no
real
basic
difference
that
i
see
in
our
pleadings
down
there.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
they
should
approve
either
one
or
two
things.
they
weren't
asked
to
leave
or
when
they
were
asked,
they
did
leave
but
they
concede
that
those
conditions
existed
and
we
met
that
burden
of
proof.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
of
course
mr.
pizitz
himself
didn't
ask
that
somebody
who
was
simply
quoting
him
and
saying
what
he
assumed
mr.
pizitz
meant
in
this
thing.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
but
they
had
put
in
a
plea
of
state
action,
certainly,
they
would
have
been
able
to
come
in
and
establish
that.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
in
essence,
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
i
would've
said
that,
it
would've
been
a
very
good
false
value
--
it
had
mr.
pizitz
up
there
and
testified
to
that
and
prior
to
that
it
could
have
pleaded
to
that
effect
and
let
the
court
know
that
that
was
an
issue
in
this
case
as
well
as
the
question
did
they
or
were
they
in
fact
ever
told
to
leave
and
did
in
fact
leave
after
they
were
told
to.
those
were
the
two
issues
that
were
there.
they
could
have
put
the
other
issues
in
and
in
fact,
i
think
it
would
have
been
advised
to
bring
mr.
pizitz
to
say,
“well,
i
want
them
to
sit
at
the
lunch
counter.
i'd
like
to
have
them
here.”
but
this
confound
the
city
ordinance
which
i
know
is
invalid
(inaudible)
but
that
isn't
in
this
record.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
no
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
--
i'm
not
completely
clear
on
what
his
honor
had
referenced
to
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
proof
of
mental
operation,
a
mental
operation.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
think
it
would
be.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
the
mental
operations,
i
think
we'd
get
into
a
rather
dangerous
(inaudible).
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
not
in
writing,
it's
my
impression
in
the
criminal
side.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
the
pleadings
must
be
filed
in
writing
exactly
speaking
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
don't
know
on
the
criminal
level
that's
why
i
went
to
some
extent
to
point
out
these
things
were
civil
in
my
brief
because
i
think
that
rule
--
we've
traveled
pretty
much
on
the
common
law
in
the
criminal
cases.
we
simply
prescribed
the
forms
of
pleas
in
criminal
cases
if
you
want
to
put
them
in
issue.
self-defense
i
think
is
just
a
matter
of
argument
and
of
course
it's
--
it
would
--
i
don't
think
it
would
even
require
a
plea
because
the
events
means
that
he
did
it
without
some
provocation.
in
other
words,
its
negative
in
its
sense
--
in
itself,
the
self-defense.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
i
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
your
honor,
i
can't
answer
your
question
in
all
of
these
fringed
areas.
i
will
just
answer
--
i
admit
i
can't.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
would
not
go
that
far
personally
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
it
said
that
after
being
warned,
i
think
we
have
to
assume
it
comes
in
our
code
out
of
the
chapter
heading
of
trespass
and
of
course
trespass
assumes
that
there
is
a
proprietary
address
and
i
don't
know
how
we
could
assume
that
the
police
officer
had
any
proprietary
interest.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
heading
of
trespass.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
think
by
implication,
you'd
have
to
construe
it
that
way
and
its
context
as
a
trespass
ordinance.
someone
in
possession
or
some
agent,
designee
or
a
servant
of
the
person
in
possession
or
at
least
mr.
pizitz's
greater
--
must
be
greater
than
the
customer
who
is
directed
to
leave.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
think
he
would
have.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
that
follow
the
language
of
the
ordinance
after
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
--
being
warned.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
that's
right
sir,
yes
sir.
and
if
someone
other
than
a
person
in
authority
had
ordered
them
off,
that
would
be
an
issue.
we
must
prove
that
they
were
warned
and
i
think
it
goes
without
saying
that
a
proprietary
address
must
be
involved
in
that
person
warning.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
no
sir.
i
think
the
evidence
showed
that
these
were
employees
which
they
concede.
they
have
never
denied
that.
they
don't
raise
the
issue
to
some
stranger
or
some
policeman
ordered
them
off
the
premises.
and
i
don't
think
the
officers
could
order
them
off.
they
took
the
reports
after
talking
with
the
people
there.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
thank
you
sir.
