mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
understand
mr.
rein,
he's
no
longer
arguing
about
the
first
issue
which
he
presented
to
this
court.
that
is
whether
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
erred
in
refusing
to
allow
the
reopening
of
the
deportation
proceedings
for
a
second
time
to
hear
petitioner's
proper
testimony
that
he
had
never
advocated
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence.
now,
since
he
is
no
longer
making
this
contention,
the
government's
answer
to
this
may
be
either
irrelevant
or
if
it's
not
irrelevant,
it
could
be
left
to
the
brief.
i
would
just
like
to
know
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
if
that's
the
--
if
that's
his
sole
(voice
overlap)
issue.
if
that's
his
sole
issue,
then
he's
also
given
up
on
another
point
which
he
wasn't
quite
so
explicit
on
and
that's
whether
he
was
denied
any
rights
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
knowing
--
having
two
judges
to
decide
his
second
appeal.
i
don't
think
that's
a
very
serious
issue.
he
only
contends
that
this
violated
the
spirit
of
the
statute
not
its
letter.
i
think
it's
sufficiently
answered
in
the
government's
brief
and
i'll
pass
that
over
too.
turning
now
to
what
mr.
rein
says
is
the
issue
in
the
case,
and
that
is
whether
the
evidence
was
sufficient
under
the
standards
laid
down
by
this
court
in
galvan,
rowoldt,
and
niukkanen,
not
merely
in
rowoldt
because
rowoldt
doesn't
purport
to
create
a
new
standard,
purports
to
follow
the
standard
in
galvan
and
niukkanen
also
purports
to
follow
the
standard
in
galvan.
that
under
those
standards,
whether
there
was
reasonable
substantial
and
probative
evidence
as
section
242
of
the
1952
act
requires
to
sustain
petitioner's
deportation.
i
wish
to
underline
the
standard
here
is
not
the
criminal
standard.
it's
not
the
standard
in
expatriation
cases.
it's
reasonable,
substantial
and
probative
evidence.
and
under
rowoldt,
in
galvan,
and
niukkanen,
that
would
be
reasonable,
substantial,
and
probative
evidence
of
meaningful
membership
in
the
communist
party.
now,
at
the
start,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
this
issue
has
already
been
fully
litigated.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
found
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
under
the
standard
in
galvan
in
the
first
deportation
proceeding.
after
rowoldt
had
been
determined
by
this
court,
the
board
held
that
the
evidence
established
meaningful
membership
in
the
communist
party
under
the
standards
laid
down
in
the
galvan
decision.
in
making
this
determination,
the
board
did
not
rely
as
petitioner
contends
on
petitioner's
mere
membership
in
the
communist
party.
instead
the
board
emphasized
and
this
is
--
mr.
justice
goldberg
pointed
out
that
the
actual
findings
are
at
page
2
of
the
record
that
after
peti
--
petitioner's
active
participation
in
communist
party
affairs,
which
the
board
emphasized
was
totally
unexplained
unlike
in
the
rowoldt
decision.
and
the
board's
determination
was
sustained
in
the
face
of
explicit
attacks
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
by
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
and
then
in
the
denial
of
certiorari
by
this
court.
after
the
board
refused
to
reopen
the
deportation
proceedings
for
a
second
time,
petitioner
again
attacked
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
and
both
of
these
courts
again
denied
these
contentions.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
it
will
not
reassess
administrative
findings
of
fact
which
have
been
carefully
considered
by
the
lower
courts.
and
we
submit
that
it
follows
a
fortiori
in
this
case,
that
in
the
absence
of
the
plainest
kind
of
error,
that
the
prior
review
of
the
board's
findings
of
fact
in
litigation
which
came
through
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
and
to
the
--
this
court,
the
highest
court
in
the
land,
should
be
conclusive
here.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
they
--
at
that
point,
rowoldt
hadn't
been
decided,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
pardon
me?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
rowoldt
decided
that
merely
voluntary
membership
was
not
enough.
now,
at
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
understand
rowoldt
to
hold
nothing
different
than
what
--
than
what
this
court
had
decided
in
the
galvan
case
although
with
further
explanation.
now,
i
--
it
seems
to
me
therefore
that
--
that
the
crucial
--
that
the
crucial
test
is
--
is
what
this
court
laid
down
in
galvan
and
which
in
rowoldt
was
explicitly
reaffirmed.
it
isn't
a
matter
that
it
was
something
that
rowoldt
was
silent
on
the
issue.
it
reaffirmed
the
test.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
that
would
--
the
government
does
not
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
you
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
--
there
are
series
of
things
i
would
like
to
answer
in
that.
i
don't
think
rowoldt
modified
galvan.
the
reason
i
don't
think
so
is
because
rowoldt
says
that
it's
not.
it
applies
the
standard
of
galvan.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
said
--
it
says
more
than
just
membership.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
is
--
it
--
the
court
in
--
in
galvan
said
at
page
528
of
347
united
states
v.
forest,
“it
is
enough
that
the
alien
joined
the
party
and
doesn't
stop
there
because
that
would
be
membership”,
aware
that
he
was
joining
an
organization
known
as
the
communist
party
which
operates
as
a
distinct
and
active
political
organization
and
that
he
did
so
of
his
own
free
will.
now
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
this
court
found
that
it
wasn't
for
the
reason
that
rowoldt's
un-contradicted
statement
was
that
he
joined
the
party
for
other
than
political
reasons.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
it
said
the
reason
he
joined
the
communist
party
was
because
he
was
fighting
for
something
to
eat
and
he
was
looking
for
the
necessities
of
life.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i'm
assuming
that
there's
more
content
than
just
the
con
--
just
the
conclusion.
he
says
well
i've
read
the
rowoldt
decision
and
i
am
--
i'm
going
to
testify
to
the
conclusions
there.
i
assume
that
he's
going
to
--
he's
going
to
give
to
--
he's
going
to
be
specific
as
to
why
he
joined
the
party.
if
that's
un-contradicted
by
the
government
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
and
the
government
does
not
say
that
he
had
any
other
reason,
and
there's
no
way
you
can
draw
an
inference
from
objective
facts
such
as
active
participation
in
party
affairs
which
would
contradict
your
statement,
then
we
--
then
we'd
have
rowoldt.
that's
--
that
--
those
are
the
facts
in
rowoldt.
and
i
suppose
there
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
now,
i
may
say
that
the
court's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
as
i
understand
that
the
difference
between
the
dissent
and
the
majority
of
rowoldt
was
in
the
--
was
in
the
--
with
the
evidence,
and
also
whether
--
also
whether
--
well,
i
think
it
was
mainly
in
the
evidence
that
the
majority
said
that
there
was
no
political
implications
in
his
joining.
the
dissent
in
particularly
relying
on
the
appendix
set
out
some
evidence
indicating
that
he
did
have
political
motivations
in
his
joining
and
in
his
membership.
now
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
the
only
--
the
only
lack
of
the
solidity
of
proof
is
--
is
this
lack.
i
--
in
this,
it
was
just
a
general
statement
which
wasn't
going
to
be
tied
to
any
--
any
of
the
specific
evidence
in
the
case.
the
only
thing
that
they
specifically
tied
it
to
was
this
being
devoid
of
any
political
implications.
and
therefore,
i
have
--
i
have
to
assume
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
that
that
was
the
crucial
thing.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
he
--
the
majority
went
on
also
to
say
and
i
gather
that
--
that
this
also
a
part
of
what
it
thought
was
lacking,
presumably,
he,
rowoldt
had
to
live
on
something
and
further
inquiry
might
have
elicited
that
he
was
getting
the
necessities
of
life
where
he's
worked
in
the
bookshop
nor
was
there
a
hint
in
the
record
that
this
was
not
a
bona
fide
bookshop.
i
--
the
tenor
of
the
opinion
was
that
this
was
a
man
who
was
there
for
economic
reasons
and
not
for
political
reasons
that
under
galvan,
this
court
said,
that
person
had
to
join
the
communist
party
as
a
distinct
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
if
you
--
if
you
compare
the
facts
in
niukkanen
and
in
rowoldt,
they're
not
tremendously
differently.
the
only
thing
that
niukkanen
had
that
was
different
than
rowoldt
that
i
can
see
that's
of
any
considerable
importance
is
that
niukkanen
didn't
say
he
joined
the
communist
party
for
any
other
than
political
reasons.
now
niukkanen
--
it
is
true
there
is
evidence
in
the
niukkanen
case
that
said
that
niukkanen
was
in
the
“top
fraction”
of
the
communist
party,
although
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
dissent
that
he
said
he
wasn't
a
functionary.
i
--
assuming
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
that
he
was
in
the
“top
fraction”
of
the
communist
party
and
further
that
he
discussed
communist
actions
with
other
people
in
the
communist
party.
i
still
--
that
evidence
doesn't
advance
you
tremendously
past
rowoldt
unless
you
emphasize
the
distinction
that
in
niukkanen,
that
alien
did
not
explain
why
he
was
in
the
communist
party.
that's
--
that
is
the
major
distinction
and
this
is
the
major
distinction
which
has
been
seen
by
the
courts
of
appeals.
he
too
was
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
is
evidence
in
this
case
that
is
different
and
it
seems
to
me
in
at
least
three
important
respects
why
this
case
is
stronger.
first
in
rowoldt,
the
alien
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
for
a
year,
as
long
ago
was
1935.
now,
that's
a
very,
very
different
situation
than
a
man
who
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
1948
to
1950.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
--
that
difference
but
also
more
important
is
the
time.
in
1935,
it
was
not
--
is
well
known
that
the
communist
party
was
an
active
political
organization
with
particular
views.
now,
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
any
average
and
the
intelligent
person,
in
9th
--
who
was
living
in
this
country
in
1948
to
1950
had
any
doubts
that
the
communist
party
was
an
active
political
organization.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
there's
[inaudible]
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
mr.
rowoldt
apparently
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
mr.
rowoldt
apparently
doubted
because
he
--
he
apparently
joined
it
to
get
something
to
eat
and
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
sir.
that's
right,
your
honor.
if
rowoldt
hadn't
--
if
rowoldt
hadn't
testified
and
that
hadn't
been
--
and
if
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'm
--
the
only
evidence
was
a
statement
and
that
was
the
equivalent
of
testimony
because
under
the
board's
rules,
if
--
it
allows
the
admission
of
statements.
you're
right,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
they're
introduced
it
--
as
evidence.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
pardon
me.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
in
rowoldt?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
in
rowoldt,
but
he
didn't
testify,
your
honor.
assuming,
in
the
same
sense
that
i
used,
testified
to
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
that
was
1935.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
other
--
the
other
important
thing
is
that
there
is
testimony
in
this
record
that
he
was
a
member
--
that
he
attended
at
least
a
few
executive
meetings
and
that
he
was
apparently
an
officer
of
his
local
unit.
now
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
--
there
isn't
an
explicit
finding,
your
honor,
but
that's
how
i
read
this
on
page
2
of
the
record
which
mr.
justice
goldberg
was
--
is
alluding
to,
that
for
several
months,
an
attempt
was
made
to
make
the
respondent
a
leading
figure
in
the
unit
of
the
communist
party.
i
think
that
--
that
is
the
evidence
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
--
let's
see.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
that
is
--
that
is
the
testimony.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
record
in
this
case,
the
actual
record
which
you
don't
have
here
is
some
300
--
250
pages
long,
but
almost
all
of
it
is
on
cross-examination
in
the
light
which
doesn't
go
directly
to
the
issues.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
elorriaga.
i
may
--
i
may
say
on
that
issue
because
mr.
rein
has
made
a
great
deal
of
it
that
special
inquiry
officer
who
heard
the
testimony
of
scarletto
and
elorriaga
specifically
credited
both
witnesses.
now,
his
report
is
--
his
decision
is
not
again
in
the
printed
record.
it
is
in
the
record
which
is
--
which
the
clerk
has.
now,
he
specifically
credited
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
--
there
was
one
discrepancy
in
the
testimony
which
was
not
brought
up
before
the
special
inquiry
officer.
nobody
noticed
it.
it
was
--
he
said
at
one
point
that
elorriaga
said
at
one
point
the
petitioner
attended
meetings
regularly,
i
think
it
was
maybe
two
or
three
times
a
month
over
the
two-year
period.
and
then
later
on,
he
said,
that
he
had
seen
him
at
two
or
three
meetings
in
1949
and
1951.
now
nobody
noticed
this
discrepancy
when
the
hearing
was
actually
being
held,
and
so
it
wasn't
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
government
or
the
witness
that
he
had
testified
in
contradiction
to
himself.
the
board
noticed
the
discrepancy.
i
suppose
counsel
brought
it
to
the
board's
attention.
the
board
said
that
it
didn't
have
to
decide
which
version
was
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
the
only
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
only
--
the
only
--
the
only
actual
reference
to
that
point
which
is
in
any
of
its
opinions
is
the
sentence
that
i've
pointed
out
to
you
on
page
2.
that's
--
i
think
what
it
is
alluding
to.
i
don't
know
of
anything
else
in
the
record
it
could
be
alluded
to.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
then
later
on,
your
honor,
i
didn't
come
back
to
the
--
this
part
of
your
earlier
suggestion
to
me.
at
that
point,
rowoldt
hadn't
determined
that
the
language
that's
--
that
one
uses
in
these
cases
is
meaningful
that
that
--
you
don't
just
find
--
you
got
to
find
meaningful.
the
issue
then
came
before
the
board
again
specifically
arguing
rowoldt
to
the
board.
the
board
said
looking
again
at
the
record,
that
this
was
meaningful.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
think
the
findings
that
--
the
findings
are
the
same.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
new
findings
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
was
no
new
testimony.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
--
i
think
there
is
another
point
and
i
can't
find
it
at
the
moment.
there
is
another
point
where
the
board
says
that
petitioner
was
a
regular
member,
he
attended
meetings
regularly,
and
that
he
paid
dues
regularly.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
but
rowoldt
--
again
i
have
to
emphasize
that
rowoldt
explained
why
he
was
in
the
communist
party.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
--
that
is
the
most
important
difference
in
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
the
ones
that
i've
--yes.
--
indicated
to
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
would
think
--
i
would
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
in
the
next
case
to
figure
--
i'm
not
so
sure
in
the
next
case
that
the
government
is
going
to
let
them
--
those
kinds
of
statements
go
un-contradicted.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
it's
possible
that
more
evidence
could
have
been
gotten
even
in
this
case.
i
don't
know.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
scar
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
you
can't
--
you
may
not
be
able
to
contradict
that
directly.
but
it
would
--
in
this
case,
scarletto
and
elorriaga
were
at
meetings
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
scarletto
and
elorriaga
were
at
meetings
in
which
petitioner
was
present,
communist
party
meetings.
now,
if
this
issue
was
squarely
presented,
that
he
said
at
the
hearing,
the
witness
said,
“well,
i
just
joined
the
communist
party
because
i
was
looking
for
--
looking
for
food.”
it
may
well
be
that
scarletto
could
testify.
well,
he
talked
about
an
awful
lot
of
other
things.
he
talked
about
the
--
that
the
communist
party
should
try
to
spread
its
influence
in
the
steel
plants.
i
don't
know
what
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
may
say
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
the
reason
it
did,
your
honor,
because
at
that
time,
both
sides
believe
that
just
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
voluntarily,
it
was
enough
at
the
time
of
the
--
of
the
hearing
in
the
board's
first
decision.
now,
i
think
rowoldt
explained
that
galvan
didn't
mean
just
that,
that
there
was
something
else
that
would
be
relevant.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
did,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
what
happened.
it
went
back
to
the
board.
that's
what
we
--
well,
the
second
time
the
board
didn't
allow
reopening
but
he
went
back
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
to
the
board
the
first
time
in
--
yes,
it
did.
the
board
explicitly
allowed
reopening
in
the
light
of
rowoldt.
that's
exactly
what
happened.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
he
did,
he
had
a
lawyer
all
the
way
through.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
but
he
didn't
testify
although
--
i
want
to
make
that
clear.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
didn't
take
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
they
had
extensive
cross-examination
over
hundreds
of
pages
but
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
cross-examination
as
to
what
occurred
at
the
meetings.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
he
said
he
only
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
--
well,
he
--
what
happened
when
it
went
back,
he
said,
he
said
that
the
board
--
all
he
was
arguing
was
that
under
rowoldt,
the
evidence
was
insufficient.
the
same
argument
he's
making
here.
so
the
board
said,
“well,
we're
also
giving
you
the
opportunity
to
present
more
evidence
under
rowoldt.”
he
said,
“well,
you
misconstrued
my
petition
to
reopen.”
and
so
the
board
found
that
on
an
existing
evidence,
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
show
that
he
was
a
meaningful
member
of
the
communist
party.
so
he's
had
--
it's
not
a
matter
of
not
having
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
he's
--
he
came
here
in
1920
so
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
at
the
moment
he's
been
here
43
years.
he
wasn't
at
the
time
he's
a
member,
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he's
53.
let
me
say
--
i
don't
know
that
this
is
relevant
but
mr.
justice
goldberg
asked
what
employment
he
had.
the
record
indicates
and
i
gather
maybe
he's
had
different
jobs.
the
reason
for
this,
there's
one
point
in
the
record
which
scarletto
says
that
he
left
to
sell
insurance
for
a
while.
and
then
the
alien
registration
form
when
he
--
that
he
filed
with
the
government
indicated
that
he
was
self-employed
in
the
ice
business.
so
i
gather
maybe
that
as
i
say
that
he's
had
different
job.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
of
course,
that
isn't
the
test
under
this
provision
of
the
statute.
i
mentioned
one
other
thing
about
what
he
did
in
the
party.
there
is
--
there
is
a
statement
that
the
reason
he
didn't
attend
more
meetings
--
and
by
the
way
the
number
of
meetings
to
be
absolutely
accurate
that
scarletto
testified
to
is
two
or
three
in
the
el
sereno
club.
he
was
in
two
clubs,
two
or
three
in
the
el
sereno
club
at
the
beginning
of
1949
and
at
least
15
or
16
in
the
mexican
concentration
club
from
1949
at
least
through
1950.
now,
there's
an
indication
why
he
didn't
attend
more
meetings
and
that
is,
scarletto
says
that
he
was
occasionally
transferred
out
by
the
party
to
other
work.
scarletto
apparently
may
not
have
known
what
the
other
work
was
or
at
least
he
didn't
testify
to
what
it
was.
but
that
may
explain
why
he
didn't
attend
more
meetings
although
he
was
a
regular
member
of
the
unit.
he
paid
dues
regularly
and
sometimes
had
amounted
to
a
considerable
amount
of
money
because
they
had
special
assessments.
now,
i
haven't
yet
come
to
the
issue
which
mr.
rein
says
this
is
the
heart
of
the
case
and
i
think
it
may
indeed
be,
and
that
is
this
issue
which
may
be
called
the
burden
of
proof
issue.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
--
the
dues
themselves,
the
actual
assessments
i
think
were
a
dollar
a
month
but
then
they
gave
special
assessments
for
--
for
drives
and
things
like
that.
i
can't
--
can't
remember
the
exact
amount
but
some
of
those
i
think
if
my
recollection
is
correct,
would
amount
to
$25
or
$50,
i
may
be
wrong,
your
honor.
i
--
it's
not
in
this
portion;
it's
not
in
the
printed
record.
i
don't
believe
it's
--
it's
in
the
transcript.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
was
from
--
he
was
48
--
the
board
said
1948
or
1949
to
the
end
of
1950,
at
least
to
the
end
of
1950.
there
were
seven
testimonies
by
elorriaga
that
he
was
--
that
went
into
1951.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
rowoldt
was
1935,
that's
right,
your
honor.
galvan
was
1944
to
1946
and
niukkanen
was
1937
to
1939.
that's
what
we
think
the
evidence
here
on
this
fact
and
i
think
it
is
an
important
fact.
it's
considerably
strong
for
in
this
case
that
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
when
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
galvan
said
the
test
was
whether
he
joined
the
communist
party
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
but
rowoldt
purports
to
apply
this
standard.
that's
the
reason
i
think
it's
significant.
galvan
says
that
the
test
is
whether
you
join
the
communist
party
as
a
political
organization.
this
court
said
in
rowoldt
that
he
joined
the
communist
party
for
economic
reasons.
now,
that's
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
your
honor,
i
really
must
emphasize
this
point
because
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
it
sorted
out
there
must
be
substantial
basis
for
finding
that
an
alien
committed
himself
to
the
communist
party
in
consciousness
that
he
was
quote,
and
this
is
from
galvan,
“joining
an
organization
known
as
the
communist
party
which
operates
as
a
distinct
and
active
political
organization.”
i
think
it
excerpted
this
test
from
galvan
and
then
applied
it.
i
don't
think
there's
any
other
way
to
read
it
and
then
niukkanen
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
difference
is
on
the
facts
between
galvan
and
press
and
this
case
are
too
obvious
to
be
detailed
and
niukkanen
does
exactly
the
same
thing.
it
says
that
it's
relying
on
the
ultimate
question
is
whether
petitioner
is
subject
to
deportation
under
galvan
and
press
or
it's
saved
from
it
under
rowoldt
and
perfetto.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
they
said
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
in
the
majo
--
in
the
majority
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
niukkanen
was
per
curiam,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
galvan,
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
on
the
question
of
the
facts
in
niukkanen,
of
course,
it's
to
the
government's
benefit
to
make
the
facts
in
niukkanen
as
weak
as
possible
so
that
we
can
show
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
that's
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
only
thing
that
the
majority
alludes
to
is
this
question
of
whether
niukkanen
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
the
majority
says
that
was
a
question
of
fact.
they're
going
to
accept
the
determination
of
the
district
court
and
that
--
and
that
under
rowoldt
and
galvan,
this
was
sufficient
to
show
meaningful
membership.
now,
the
dissent
says,
that
niukkanen
really
hadn't
done
very
much.
it
says
that
he
wasn't
as
functionary
of
the
communist
party.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
as
i've
indicated,
said
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
“top
fraction”.
if
the
dissent
in
niukkanen
is
right,
that
he
was
not
a
functionary,
he
really
wasn't
very
important
at
all,
then
i
think
niukkanen
is
absolutely
controlling
on
this
case.
i
am
not
going
back
into
the
record
to
find
out
whether
the
dissent
in
niukkanen
is
accurate
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
niukkanen
is
wrong
or
the
converse
is
true,
but
it's
to
the
government's
benefit
to
if
the
facts
in
niukkanen
is
weak
as
possible,
i
suppose.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
very
detailed
consideration
--.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
this
controversy
about
official
by
the
way,
as
far
as
the
convention
is
concerned,
i
gather
what
scarletto
meant
was
he
didn't
know
what
capacity
was
there.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
was
there
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
that's
--
of
course,
that's
an
issue
that
--
that
hasn't
been
briefed
or
argued
by
either
side
i
may
say
that
the
question
of
the
point
is
i'm
not
ruling
much
of
the
position
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
perfect
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
thing
is
perfectly
clear
from
page
2
that
that
paragraph,
one
of
the
findings
of
the
board.
we
believe
this
record
establishes
the
respondent's
membership
was
voluntary,
that's
the
last
sentence
of
that
paragraph.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'd
assume
that
means
that
the
things
that
are
stated
in
that
paragraph
are
accepted
as
true
by
the
board.
now,
the
government
says
that
what's
found
in
that
paragraph
is
sufficient
under
rowoldt,
and
the
absence
of
any
explanation
whatsoever
by
the
alien.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
right.
but
your
honor,
let
me
try
--
i
don't
think
i
am
making
myself
clear.
that
paragraph
says
that
the
following
facts
are
true.
we've
looked
at
the
record.
we've
accept
it's
true
the
following
facts
and
they've
followed
a
series
of
facts,
the
dues,
the
meetings
and
the
like.
they
say
on
the
basis
of
those
facts,
we
make
a
determination;
the
conclusion
that
respondent's
membership
was
voluntary.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
okay
now,
then
rowoldt
was
decided,
but
the
alien
argued
to
the
board
that
rowoldt
was
controlling
that
the
facts
which
had
been
established
did
not
show
meaningful
membership,
but
the
board
then
said
--
the
board
then
said
that
the
facts
in
the
record
established
meaningful
membership.
now,
those
facts
that
it
had
found
are
on
page
2.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
then
--
i
think
that
that
is
the
issue
whether
those
facts
are
sufficient
to
show
meaningful
membership.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
think
--
as
i
--
as
i
say
in
general,
some
of
the
--
some
of
the
things
in
the
record
are
more
specific
as
to
what
--
in
other
words,
he
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
when
the
--
no,
your
honor,
only
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
this.
underneath
each
one
of
those
general
sentences,
there
are
number
of
specific
facts
that
are
testified,
they
didn't
testify
it
generally
as
these
sentences
would
indicate.
but
these
are
con
--
general
sentences
including
a
number
of
subsidiary
facts
which
were
testified
to
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
that's
all
i'm
--
he
attended
executive
meetings
and
he
attended
the
convention.
that's
--
that's
all
i'm
suggesting
by
that.
these
--
these
conclusory
sentences
as
to
facts,
grouping
facts
within
--
with
one
--
within
a
general
statement,
we
submit,
are
sufficient
under
rowoldt
to
establish
meaningful
nature.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
you
do.
i
think
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
that's
right,
because
it
isn't
a
different
theory.
it's
just
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
we
--
of
course
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
--
the
board
found
that
it
believed
scarletto
and
it
believed
elorriaga.
now,
i
think
anything
they
testified
to
can
be
used
to
support
this.
i
don't
--
i
don't
want
to
press
this
too
far
because
i
don't
think
you're
going
to
find
very
much
other
than
things
that
are
concluded
within
those
sentences.
and
i
don't
--
i
think
we
could
have
a
discussion
but
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
pretty
theoretical
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
difference
in
time
and
length
of
time.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
totally
different.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
that
thing
(voice

--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that
they
haven't
assumed
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that
shows
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
find
that
this
is
--
that
this
at
the
very
least
means
that
he
was
not
just
the
average
person
down
at
the
bottom.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'm
not
sure
about
the
closed
part
of
it
in
rowoldt
but
(inaudible)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
board
did.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
board
substituted
it.
it
wasn't
just
that
i
wanted
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
along
with
the
fact
that
there
was
no
explanation.
that's
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
it's
substituted.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
what
i
was
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
your
honor.
except
in
rowoldt
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
of
course
our
argument
is
your
honor
that
you
--
that
you
shouldn't
be
doing
that
in
this
record
because
it's
already
--
that
we've
already
had
the
determination
of
four
courts
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
and
that
the
proper
standard
is
(voice

--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
evidence
to
support
the
conclusion
that
there
was
meaningful
membership
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
that
it
doesn't
reassess
those.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
your
honor.
i'm
trying
--
if
anything,
i'm
arguing
quite
exactly
the
opposite
that
you
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
that
you
--
that
the
government's
argument
is
that
when
four
courts
have
all
found
that
the
evidence
is
sufficient,
this
court
shouldn't
reexamine
the
evidence
at
all
except
for
when
there
is
indication
of
the
plainness
sort
of
error
and
this
is
nothing
novel.
this
court
has
said
it
in
numerous
cases.
i'm
quite
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
1935.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
i
--
indeed
i
do
emphasize
that
point.
i
think
it
is
important,
then
if
--
that
in
the
30s
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that
is
of
considerable
importance
that
people
in
the
--
in
the
1940s,
i
think,
were
quite
aware
of
the
nature
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
appears
twice
your
honor,
actually.
it
appears
at
--
on
page
14.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh,
what
--
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
rowoldt
hadn't
been
decided
when
that
opinion
was
handed
down.
the
terms
meaningful
membership,
i
don't
think
it
even
existed
in
the
law
at
the
time
that
--
that
this
first
opinion
was
handed
down.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
you
can
find
nothing
in
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
not
--
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
the
document
you're
reviewing.
if
you
were
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
if
you
were
reviewing
that
document,
and
there'd
been
no
consideration
of
rowoldt,
it
might
be
--
well,
it
might
be
the
proper
disposition
to
send
it
back
to
the
board
to
determine
whether
the
standards
of
rowoldt
had
been
met.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
been
done.
that's
exactly
what
has
been
done.
it's
been
done
three
times.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
what
they
said
--
no,
this
isn't
a
matter
of
what
they
meant.
they
said
that
the
testimony
which
had
been
taken
satisfied
the
standards
of
rowoldt,
then
they
said
and
this
is
in
the
--
in
the
first
reopening
of
the
proceedings.
we
will
allow
the
petitioner
even
though
we
think
that
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
rowoldt,
despite
that
we
will
allow
the
petitioner
to
have
the
opportunity
to
introduce
further
evidence
on
this
issue,
petitioner
decided
not
to
do
so.
he
had
no
evidence
apparently.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
it's
in
the
--
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
that's
of
course
the
board's
conclusion,
the
actual
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
on
pages
9
to
13
is
the
hearing
on
the
reopening
when
petitioner
said
that
he
had
nothing
to
introduce.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
--
to
the
issue
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
it
was
satis
--
well,
the
reason
he
was
satisfied
is
because
the
board
i
suppose
had
already
said
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
under
rowoldt.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
was
an
opinion.
[laughter]
it
was
an
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
what
happened
--
what
happened
was
this,
your
honor.
you
had
the
first
decision
of
voluntary
membership
found
by
the
board.
rowoldt
was
decided.
petitioner
then
moved
to
reopen.
the
board
said
--
to
reconsider
under
rowoldt
and
reopen,
the
board
then
found
that
rowoldt
did
not
require
a
different
determination.
it
analyzed
the
rowoldt
decision;
it
said
the
evidence
was
sufficient,
but
it
would
allow
petitioner
to
reopen
even
though
the
evidence
was
sufficient
as
it
now
stood.
petitioner
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
precisely
and
then
--
and
then
he
deliberately
decided
to
introduce
no
evidence.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
and
that
--
and
that
of
course,
is
the
--
is
the
controversy
between
the
petitioner
and
the
government.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
pardon
me.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
yates
--
i
don't
know
the
exact
time,
but
it
was
prior
to
the
original
hearing
because
scarletto
testified
at
the
yates
case,
in
fact,
i
think
--
so
i
know
that
it
was
prior,
i
don't
know
the
exact
date.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
elorriaga
was
not.
scarletto
was.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
--
well,
i
think
--
no,
wait
a
minute.
no
--
the
trial
--
the
trial
in
--
in
yates
was
in
1952
because
that
--
because
that's
the
time
that
scarletto
left
the
communist
party
to
testify
at
the
--
at
yates'
trial.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
in
the
time
i
have
left
to
the
issue
of
--
that
petitioner
calls
the
burden
of
proof.
and
he
emphasizes
that
the
board
said
at
one
--
in
one
of
the
opinions,
that
there
wasn't
a
great
deal
of
evidence
showing
petitioner's
awareness
that
he
was
joining
the
communist
party
as
distinct
political
organization.
petitioner
emphasizes
to
show
that
there
wasn't
proof
satisfying
the
standards
of
galvan
and
rowoldt.
but
as
the
board
and
the
lower
courts
have
all
held,
if
petitioner
had
not
known
that
the
political
implications
joined
the
communist
party,
it
was
his
responsibility
to
come
forward
with
such
evidence
just
as
rowoldt
had
done.
we
submit
there's
nothing
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
he
had.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
the
government's
argument
is
this
evidence
is
sufficient
to
establish
meaningful
membership.
we
say
that
the
normal
inference
that
can
be
drawn
from
somebody
showing
up
at
the
communist
party
meetings
for
over
two
years
paying
dues,
attending
a
party
convention,
attending
executive
meetings
is
that
he
knew
what
he
was
doing,
that
he
was
joining
a
political
organization.
we
say
that's
the
normal
and
reasonable
inference
that
you
can
draw
that
kind
of
an
inference
in
any
kind
of
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
what
this
court
said
in
galvan.
and
then
we
said
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
that's
--
that's
what
this
court
said
in
galvan
and
then
said
again.
that's
right.
that's
--
that's
--
that's
the
government's
position
and
we
say
that
you
can
draw
that
inference
from
an
active
participation
in
communist
affairs.
and
this
isn't
a
novel
doctrine
that
the
government
is
suggesting.
you
can
do
this
in
criminal
cases.
in
fact,
in
criminal
cases,
the
burden
may
even
be
on
the
defendant
to
come
forward
with
evidence
not
the
burden
of
proof
and
i
wanted
to
distinguish
the
burden
of
proof.
we
have
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
--
i'm
trying
to
explain
the
distinction.
i
don't
(voice
overlap).
i
could
not
be
successful.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
distinction
as
i
see
it
is,
that
for
certain
types
of
things
that
are
peculiarly
within
the
knowledge
of
one
party,
it
is
required
to
come
forward,
but
the
finder
of
fact
in
assessing
the
proof
which
is
before
it
assesses
it
on
the
basis
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
maybe
--
it
maybe
on
the
other
party.
now,
in
this
case
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
government,
but
we
don't
have
to
go
as
far
as
that.
we
say
the
normal
inference
from
this
--
from
these
--
from
the
facts
in
this
case
isn't
membership
in
the
communist
party
knowing
that
it
is
an
active
political
organization.
now,
we
say
if
there
was
any
evidence
to
rebut
this
normal
inference
which
could
have
been
--
we
say
that
kind
of
inference
could
be
made
in
the
criminal
case
and
this
--
and
here
of
course,
the
standards
that
the
burden
on
the
government
is
considerably
less,
that
if
that
could
be
done
in
the
criminal
case,
it
fairly
can
be
done
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
enough.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
that's
enough.
now,
if
he
wants
to
rebut
it
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
now,
if
he
comes
in
and
says
as
in
rowoldt
that
i
joined
the
communist
party
for
nonpolitical
reasons,
then
the
standard
which
the
board
applies
in
evaluating
that
evidence
like
the
government's
evidence
is
the
government
had
the
burden
of
proof.
we
do
not
say
and
as
far
as
i
know,
none
of
the
--
the
board
did
not
say
it,
that
the
burden
of
proof
shifted
to
the
alien
in
the
sense
that
he
had
to
prove
something
by
substantial
evidence.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
finally
to
the
scales
decision.
and
this
as
members
of
the
court
have
indicated
the
scales
decision
did
not
involve
as
to
the
facts
which
were
before
it,
deportation
and
all
involved
the
criminal
prosecution
under
the
smith
act.
and
we
don't
believe
that
a
modification
in
the
standards
for
deportation
which
involves
an
entirely
different
statute
and
in
fact
an
entirely
different
constitutional
basis
should
be
inferred
from
the
court's
opinion
in
scales
unless
the
court
made
that
modification
extremely
clear.
now,
all
that
the
court
said
in
scales
and
this
is
what
petitioner
relies
on,
this
court
in
passing
on
a
similar
provision
requiring
the
deportation
of
aliens
will
become
members
of
the
communist
party.
the
provision
which
rested
on
congress
is
far
more
plenary
power
over
aliens
and
hence
did
not
press
nearly
so
closely
on
the
limits
of
constitutionality
as
this
enactment
that
is
the
--
the
smith
act,
had
no
difficulty
in
interpreting
membership
there
as
a
meaning
--
as
meaning
more
than
the
mere
voluntary
listing
of
a
person's
name
on
party
roles.
then
the
court
cited
galvan
and
rowoldt.
a
similar
construction
is
called
for
here.
now,
we
say
that
all
these
sentence
means,
all
these
two
sentences
mean
is
what
the
government
concedes
that
more
than
mere
membership
is
required
both
for
deportation
and
for
a
prosecution
under
the
smith
act.
now,
we
submit
there's
no
basis
for
believing
that
this
court
sub
silentio
in
dictum
overruled
galvan
and
rowoldt
and
niukkanen.
but
even
if
scales
did
modify
those
cases,
we
submit
that
the
evidence
here
as
to
active
membership
was
sufficient
under
the
test
laid
down
in
scales.
the
court
said
in
scales
that
the
element
of
activity
in
the
proscribed
membership
stands
apart
from
the
gradient
of
guilty
knowledge
in
that
the
former,
that
is
activity,
may
be
shown
by
defendant's
participation
in
general
party
affairs
whereas
the
latter,
the
guilty
knowledge
requires
linking
him
with
the
party's
illegal
activities
and
we
think
the
evidence
here
is
plain.
the
petitioner
did
actively
participate
in
general
party
affairs.
he
paid
dues,
he
attended
numerous
closed
meetings
of
his
unit,
he
attended
a
party
convention
and
attended
executive
sessions
for
his
party
unit,
and
he
was
apparently
an
officer
of
the
unit.
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
board
applied
proper
legal
standards,
the
standards
laid
down
in
galvan
and
rowoldt
in
finding
the
petitioner
was
a
meaningful
member
of
the
communist
party.
this
finding
is
twice
been
upheld
by
the
district
court
and
twice
been
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals.
we
submit
that
the
lower
courts
were
correct,
that
the
board's
determination,
the
petitioner
was
a
meaningful
member
of
the
communist
party.
it's
supported
by
reasonable,
substantial,
and
probative
evidence,
which
is
what
section
242
of
the
act
requires.
and
therefore,
the
government
submits
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
