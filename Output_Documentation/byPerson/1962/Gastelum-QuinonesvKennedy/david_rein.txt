mr.
david
rein
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
challenging
the
validity
of
the
deportation
order
entered
against
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner
is
a
mexican
national
who
has
resided
in
the
united
states
since
he
entered
in
this
country
in
1920
at
the
age
of
10.
he
is
married
and
supports
his
wife
who
resides
in
this
country.
he
has
two
american
born
children
and
eight
american
born
grandchildren
who
also
live
in
this
country.
although
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
he
has
lived
here
since
the
age
of
10
and
his
roots
are
definitely
in
this
country
and
not
in
mexico.
he
was
ordered
deported
on
a
finding
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
1949
and
1950,
and
hence
was
deportable
under
the
provisions
of
section
241
(a)
(6)
(c)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
mr.
david
rein
i
don't
believe
it
does.
mr.
david
rein
yes,
he
sells
tortillas
in
the
los
angeles
area.
he
comes
from
los
angeles.
mr.
david
rein
tortillas.
mr.
david
rein
no.
mr.
david
rein
no,
he's
never
gone
through
the
process
of
naturalization.
mr.
david
rein
this
section
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
provides
for
deportation
for
past
membership
in
the
communist
party.
and
the
chief
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
that
finding
can
be
--
that
holding
can
be
supported
on
the
basis
of
the
findings
made
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
in
this
case.
the
findings
upon
which
the
order
of
deportation
rests
were
set
forth
and
summarized
by
the
bia
and
that's
quoted
in
our
brief
at
page
5
to
6,
these
are
the
essential
findings.
according
to
the
bia,
membership
in
the
communist
party
was
found
to
have
been
established
on
the
testimony
of
government
witness,
scarletto,
who
testified
that
he
had
collected
communist
party
dues
from
the
respondent
and
had
attended
close
meetings
of
the
communist
party
with
him,
and
the
general
corroboration
offered
by
the
testimony
of
government
witness,
elorriaga.
there
were
no
findings
beyond
this
as
to
the
nature
of
petitioner's
membership.
there
were
no
findings
that
the
petitioner
had
ever
engaged
in
any
party
activity
of
any
kind,
or
that
he
had
ever
said
anything
at
any
party
meetings.
simply,
there's
bare
finding
that
he
had
attended
some
meetings
and
had
paid
dues.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
nevertheless
held
that
on
these
findings,
that
petitioner
was
deportable
within
the
requirements
of
this
court's
decision
in
rowoldt
and
i
digress
for
a
moment,
this
court
held
in
the
rowoldt
case,
that
aliens
who
were
only
nominal
members
of
the
party
were
not
deportable
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
establish
deportability
to
show
a
“meaningful
association”
with
the
party.
mr.
david
rein
i
submit
that
there
was
no
such
evidence.
i
can
get
to
it
--
i
tend
get
to
it
a
little
later
on
the
government's
contention,
if
i
may,
but
primarily
on
that
point,
i
would
take
this
point
that
this
--
mr.
david
rein
not
to
witness
elorriaga,
yes.
the
witness,
elorriaga,
if
i
may
digress
for
a
moment,
testified
in
this
case.
he
testified
at
one
point
that
the
petitioner
attended
meetings
regularly,
i
think
three
or
four
times
a
month
over
a
period
of
three
years.
at
another
point
in
his
testimony,
the
same
witness
testified
that
over
a
period
of
three
years,
he
saw
the
petitioner
at
a
total
of
two
meetings.
now,
what
is
significant
is
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
in
its
opinion,
recognizing
the
conflict
in
this
testimony,
said,
“we
find
it
unnecessary
to
resolve
this
conflict,
because
under
our
view,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
he
attended
two
meetings
or
meetings
regularly,
he
is
still
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
and
in
any
event,
we
will
only
consider
this
witness,
elorriaga
to
be
corroborative
of
the
witness,
scarletto.”
from
the
portion
i
have
just
read
to
you,
they
relied
upon
the
witness,
scarletto
and
said
that
elorriaga
is
merely
corroborative.
so
you
have
two
points,
i
say
both
reading
the
witness
fairly,
there
is
no
such
evidence,
and
secondly,
and
perhaps
more
decisive,
i
think
for
this
court,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
and
most
recently
in
the
burlington
truck
lines
case
that
when
a
case
comes
here
from
an
administrative
agency,
it
will
examine
it
on
the
basis
of
the
findings
made
by
the
administrative
agency
and
not
go
beyond
it.
now,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
made
no
finding
that
the
petitioner
here
had
attended
any
executive
meetings
of
the
club.
the
sole
finding
on
the
basis
of
all
elorriaga's
testimony
was
that
they
were
considered
to
be
merely
corroborative
in
view
of
the
great
contradiction
in
his
testimony.
so
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
and
although
the
government
disputes
it
and
i
have
discussed
their
statements
in
my
reply
brief
at
some
length,
but
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
on
the
bia
findings,
all
that
there
is
before
this
court
and
all
that
there
is
before
the
bia,
and
all
that
the
bia
thought
it
had
was
attendance
at
some
meetings.
and
as
i
point
out
these
meetings
were
not
more
than
about
possibly
15
meetings
over
a
period
of
two
years
and
payment
of
dues
and
nothing
more.
now,
the
bia
said
and
recognizing
the
force
of
the
rowoldt
case
that
one
of
the
prime
indicia
that
must
be
examined
in
the
rowoldt
case
to
see
whether
or
not
there
was
the
necessary
“meaningful
association”
was
the
alien's
awareness
of
the
political
implications
of
his
membership.
the
bia
recognized
that
and
in
its
opinion,
it
stated,
that
there
was
little
development
of
the
respondent's
awareness
of
the
fact
that
he
belonged
to
a
political
organization.
as
i
indicate
that
that
really
is
an
overstatement
because
there
was
no
development
of
the
respondent's
awareness.
nevertheless,
according
to
the
bia,
the
petitioner
was
deportable,
and
it
arrived
at
that
conclusion
on
the
following
theory.
on
the
theory
that
once
the
government
had
shown
a
bare
organizational
membership,
it
was
permissible
to
draw
an
inference
that
there
was
a
“meaningful
association”
and
the
bia
would
presume
a
“meaningful
association”
unless
the
alien
came
forward
and
demonstrated
to
the
contrary.
in
other
words,
the
way
they
view
the
case
was
that
once
there
was
bare
organizational
membership,
the
burden
of
proof
as
to
the
character
of
that
membership
rested
upon
the
petitioner
and
not
upon
the
government.
we
brought
a
complaint
originally
in
the
united
states
district
court
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
deportation
order
in
that
theory.
the
district
court
gave
judgment
for
the
government
and
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
agreeing
with
the
board
of
immigration
appeals'
theory
that
a
presumption
can
be
drawn
from
bare
organizational
membership,
but
it
arrived
at
this
result
by
a
very
novel
and
unprecedented
route
which
was
quite
different
from
the
one
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
had
arrived
at.
in
essence,
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
as
follows.
it
read
the
various
statutes
on
this
subject
and
this
court's
opinions
as
coming
to
the
following
conclusion
that
prior
to
the
1950
act
and
going
back
to
the
1940
act,
the
court
said,
“it
was
necessary
to
establish
deportability
to
show
that
the
alien
involved
had
personally
advocated
the
overthrow
of
government
by
force
and
violence.”
it
then
said
that
the
1950
act
which
provided
the
deportation
on
membership
alone
or
did
it
as
follows,
that
congress
made
a
legislative
finding,
that
the
communist
party
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
it
then
established
a
legislative
presumption
that
all
members
of
the
communist
party
advocated
the
overthrow
of
government
by
force
and
violence.
and
that
the
force
of
this
court's
decision
in
rowoldt
case
was
that
that
presumption
was
a
rebuttable.
we
petitioned
the
court
for
certiorari
from
that
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
pointing
out
the
novel
nature
of
the
opinion
and
what
seemed
to
be
a
faulty
analysis
of
this
court's
previous
decisions
in
the
area.
the
government
represented,
we
say
erroneously
and
they're
still
apparently
maintaining
the
same
misconstruction
of
the
record
that
the
court
had
merely
evaluated
the
testimony.
now,
there's
nothing
in
the
court's
opinion
could
show
that
they
were
merely
evaluating
testimony.
in
any
event,
this
court
denied
certiorari
at
that
time.
the
net
result
of
that
was
that
under
the
court
of
appeals
decision
which
by
virtue
of
this
court's
denial
of
certiorari,
became
the
final
law
of
the
case.
the
petitioner
was
to
be
deported
because
he
had
failed
to
rebut
the
presumption
that
he
had
personally
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
since
prior
to
that
ruling,
neither
petitioner
nor
the
service
knew
or
had
a
reason
to
know
that
such
evidence
relating
to
the
petitioner's
personal
advocacy
was
at
all
relevant
to
the
issue,
petitioner
requested
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
to
reopen
his
case
so
as
to
give
him
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
he
never
personally
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
and
hence
was
not
deportable
under
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
and
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals.
he
supported
this
motion
with
an
affidavit
to
the
effect
that
he
had
never
advocated
or
espoused
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
and
stated
that
if
the
hearing
were
reopened,
he
would
so
testify.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
granted
oral
argument
on
this
petition
to
reopen.
after
argument,
it
denied
the
petition
to
reopen
on
the
ground
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
affirmatively
himself
espoused
violent
overthrow
is
not
material
to
deportability.
it
disposed
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
on
the
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
which
justified
petitioner's
motion
was
inconsistent
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
we
concede
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
pointed
that
out
in
our
original
petition.
mr.
david
rein
no,
it's
our
view
that
the
court
of
appeals
established
the
law
of
the
case
for
this
particular
case.
we
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
overruled
galvan
against
press.
it
did
not
have
the
authority,
but
we
say
that
under
the
law
of
the
case,
once
the
court
of
appeals
established
the
particular
rule
for
this
particular
case,
it
was
certainly
binding
at
least
on
the
lower
tribunals.
mr.
david
rein
even
though
erroneous,
i
think
that's
perfectly
clear.
mr.
david
rein
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
do
not
say
that.
we
concede
that
once
this
case
comes
up
here,
this
court
is
perfectly
free
to
examine
the
case
on
the
merits,
but
we
think
on
the
merits
and
on
the
correct
analysis
of
the
evidence,
we're
certainly
would
prevail
on
either
event.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
i
think
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
david
rein
no,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
--
let
me
put
it
this
way
and
i
will
develop
it
much
later
when
i
get
into
my
arguments.
the
law
of
the
case
doctrine
holds
that
once
a
--
in
an
appellate
tribunal,
sets
down
an
issue
of
law
in
a
particular
case,
it
does
not
necessarily
apply
to
other
cases,
that
rule
of
law
is
binding
on
a
lower
tribunal
whether
or
not
correct
in
that
same
case
and
i
submit
you
could
not
have
an
orderly
process
of
law.
if
you
could
have
a
lower
tribunal
say,
“well,
i'm
not
going
to
be
bound
by
what
the
appellate
tribunal
said
in
this
case
because
it
was
wrong.
it
does
not
have
the
authority
to
inquire
into
whether
or
not
in
that
particular
case,
the
appellate
tribunal
was
correct
because
otherwise,
i
don't
know
what
the
force
of
a
ruling
of
an
appellate
tribunal
would
be.”
it
is
bound
by
it
and
it's
bound
by
that
particular
case
even
if
it
thinks
it's
wrong.
mr.
david
rein
i
would
submit
that
that
i
think
is
the
proper
issue
before
this
court.
i
felt
it
necessary
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
i
had
gone
up
before,
this
court
had
denied
certiorari
and
indicated
the
basis
on
which
we
came
back.
and
i
will
just
--
mr.
david
rein
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
rein
that's
--
i
would
submit
that
that
the
essential
issue
here.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
i
would
--
certainly
clear
that
this
court
does
not
have
to
follow
the
erroneous
reasoning
from
the
court
of
appeals.
the
law
of
the
case
doctrine
makes
it
perfectly
clear.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
the
erroneous
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
even
binding
on
the
court
of
appeals
and
it's
certainly
not
binding
on
this
court.
but
to
turn
then
for
the
question
of
what
is
the
heart
of
the
case
as
to
whether
or
not
on
these
facts,
the
--
the
petition
that
comes
within
the
rowoldt
case,
i'll
turn
now
to
argue
that.
rowoldt
against
perfetto
established
that
the
statutory
provision
which
provides
for
deportation
for
past
membership
in
the
communist
party
applies
only
to
membership
which
has
a
certain
political
significance
described
as
a
“meaningful
association.”
aliens
whose
membership
was
only
nominal
and
which
lacked
the
“meaningful
association”
are
not
deportable.
in
rowoldt
itself,
the
alien
belonged
to
the
communist
party.
there
was
much
language
which
the
government
emphasizes
in
its
brief
about
how
the
board
found
that
the
petitioner
here
voluntarily
joined
the
party.
there
is
no
question
that
rowoldt
voluntarily
joined
the
party.
he
belonged
to
the
party
for
about
a
year.
he
attended
closed
party
meetings.
he
paid
dues.
he
ran
a
party
bookstore
and
to
quote
justice
harlan,
he
had
considerable
albeit
rudimentary
knowledge
of
communist
history
and
philosophy.
mr.
david
rein
but
i
don't
know
that
anybody
disagreed
with
the
court
in
that.
secondly,
we
leave
that
out.
the
majority
said
that
he
belonged
to
the
party
for
about
a
year.
he
paid
dues
and
he
ran
a
party
bookstore.
these
findings
were
nonetheless
held
insufficient
to
establish
the
“meaningful
association”
which
was
a
requisite
for
deportability.
a
further
gloss
on
the
court's
opinion
in
rowoldt
was
given
by
this
court
in
the
subsequent
case
of
scales
against
the
united
states.
that
case
which
was
a
criminal
case
involved
the
construction
of
the
term
“member”
as
used
in
the
criminal
provisions.
he
was
not
necessarily
member
of
the
communist
party,
member
of
an
organization
advocating
the
overthrow
of
government
by
force
and
violence
but
it
involved
the
construction
of
the
meaning
of
that
word
“member”.
this
court,
relying
on
its
previous
decisions
in
galvan
and
in
rowoldt,
held
that
the
10-member
must
be
confined
to
only
active
members
and
that
it
cannot
be
applied
to
nominal
members.
in
the
course
of
its
opinion,
the
court
pointed
out
that
rowoldt,
in
relying
on
rowoldt,
would
not
permit
deportation
solely
on
the
ground
of
a
voluntary
joining
of
the
party
and
it
argued
that
a
similar
construction
would
certainly
be
applied
to
the
criminal
portion
of
the
statute.
it
is
significant
and
i
think
the
court,
it's
worthwhile
to
note
that
the
language,
so
far
as
the
word
“member”
is
concerned,
both
as
was
used
in
the
provision
of
the
smith
act
involved
in
scales,
and
both
as
used
here
in
the
deportation
provision,
both
trace
their
origin
back
to
the
alien
registration
act
of
1940.
they
both
really
go
back
to
the
same
statute.
it
is
plain
that
the
findings
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
which
i
have
quoted,
cannot
possibly
satisfy
this
term
of
“meaningful
association”
or
active
membership.
since
the
board
found
only
the
petitioner
attended
some
party
meetings
and
paid
dues
and
no
more
and
this
in
fact
was
less
than
was
found
in
rowoldt.
to
turn
very
briefly
to
the
government's
contention
as
to
the
--
what
the
facts
are
that
might
support
other
findings;
they
say
--
as
i
started
to
say
earlier,
our
first
answer
to
that,
would
be
that
this
court
ordinarily
reviews
administrative
findings
--
administrative
orders
on
the
basis
of
the
findings
made
by
the
board
of
immigration
of
--
by
the
administrative
agency.
it
does
not
go
behind
it
to
see
whether
or
not
the
agency
could
have
made
other
findings
and
could
have
acted
on
another
theory.
i
think
that
that
matter
was
put
very
succinctly,
very
recently
by
this
court
in
the
burlington
truck
case
saying
that
the
court
would
not
have
recognized
appellate
counsel's
post
hoc
argument
as
to
the
rationalization
of
an
agency's
decision.
but
leaving
that
aside,
we
turn
to
what
the
government
says,
“the
board
could
have
found
even
if
we
want
to
look
into
the
record.”
they
say
first,
that
the
petitioner
was
an
active
member
of
the
party.
now,
the
board
never
found
the
petitioner
was
active
and
unless
you
say
that
because
he
attended
meetings
and
paid
dues,
he
was
an
active
member,
it
adds
nothing.
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
activity
and
indeed,
the
government
points
to
none.
it
then
argues
that
he
was
a
regular
member
of
the
party.
now
significantly,
it
talks
constantly
throughout
its
brief
about
the
testimony
of
two
witnesses.
as
i
have
pointed
out,
the
board
relied
only
on
one
indicating
that
the
other
witness
because
of
the
big
cut
--
the
complete
contradiction
in
this
testimony
could
be
considered
only
corroborative.
that
witness,
one
scarletto,
testified
and
this
is
scarletto's
testimony,
that
petitioner
just
went
once
in
a
while
to
party
meetings.
he
testified,
and
if
you
want
to
really
look
at
the
testimony
that
his
communist
party
club
in
which
both
he
and
the
petitioner
were
members,
met
regularly
once
a
week
at
the
home
of
a
different
member
of
the
club.
nevertheless,
over
the
two-year
period,
he
could
recall
seeing
petitioner
at
the
most
at
maybe
15
meetings
or
he
wasn't
sure.
mr.
david
rein
he
--
he
went
regularly
once
a
week,
scarletto
did.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
that's
his
testimony.
he
went
and
the
club
met
regularly
once
a
week.
he
went
regularly,
he
can
recall
seeing
the
petitioner
maybe
at
15,
he
wasn't
sure.
he
said
several,
maybe
15,
maybe
16,
but
he
couldn't
be
pinned
down
to
any
number
and
the
most
he
could
say
was
several.
and
they
never
met
although
they
met
regularly
at
the
homes
of
different
members
of
the
club,
they
never
met
at
the
home
of
the
petitioner's
club.
mr.
david
rein
i'm
sorry.
they
never
met
at
--
the
club
never
met
at
the
meeting
of
petitioner's
home.
mr.
david
rein
he
said
it
varied
in
size
from
about
30
members,
i
think,
and
then
it
was
broken
up
later
into
about
15
or
16
members.
it
was
scarletto's
testimony.
mr.
david
rein
no.
what
he
said
was,
he
did
meet
petitioner
at
these
meetings
but
although
the
club
met
regularly,
once
a
week
--
mr.
david
rein
--
over
a
period
of
two
years,
he
could
only
recall
seeing
petitioner
at
several
of
those
meetings
and
at
the
most
maybe
15
over
the
period
of
two
years.
mr.
david
rein
well,
yes,
it
appears
in
the
record,
74,
here's
the
record,
at
page
74.
he
was
at
several
of
those
meetings.
by
several,
you
mean
more
than
a
couple
or
it
could
be
15
or
16
times.
the
testimony
is
to
how
often
the
party
met,
he
said
61
to
62,
how
often
the
clubs
met,
it
was
from
61
to
62
where
scarletto
said,
“one
day
a
week
the
executives
would
meet
and
then
the
club
would
meet
also
one
day
a
week.”
mr.
david
rein
he
couldn't
recall.
mr.
david
rein
but
you
have
no
present
recollection
in
regard
to
the
number
of
times.
he
says
no.
i
submit
that
when
a
witness
just
gives
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
rein
what?
mr.
david
rein
no,
it
couldn't
have
been
once
every
week.
i
don't
think
the
witness
could
possibly
say
that
he
was
at
several
of
those
meetings
when
he's
talking
about
the
fact
that
these
meetings
happened
once
a
week
over
a
period
of
two
years
which
is
a
100
meetings.
it
seems
inconceivable
to
me
that
a
witness
would
say,
“he
might
have
been
at
15
but
i'm
not
sure.”
and
in
any
event,
i
should
certainly
say,
all
that
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
found
was
that
the
witness
attended
meetings.
it
didn't
say
he
find
that
he
attended
and
i
submit
it
would
be
improper
for
him
to
find
any
more
than
that
on
the
basis
of
such
a
vague
testimony.
the
government
also
argues
that
there
was
evidence
although
the
board
made
no
findings.
the
petitioner
had
attended
a
party
convention.
we
have
set
out
in
our
footnote
the
testimony
of
scarletto
on
that
subject
at
page
7,
and
i
can
read
it
very
briefly.
the
testimony
was,
“do
you
know
whether
jose
gastelum
ever
attended
any
such
party
convention?”
answer:
i
saw
him
at
one
convention
one
time.
question:
do
you
know
whether
he
was
there
on
an
official
capacity?
answer:
no.
that's
the
total
of
his
testimony
on
that.
it's
perfectly
clear
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
saw
no
significance
in
that
particular
bit
of
testimony
as
adding
to
the
total
picture
and
had
made
no
findings
on
it.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
the
record
shows,
he
says
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
the
record
shows
exactly
what
i
have
read
that
there
was
a
convention
which
mr.
scarletto
attended
as
an
official
delegate
and
was
there
and
participated
in
the
discussions.
he
also
said
that
this
convention
was
closed
to
anybody
but
communist
party
members
and
then
he
said,
“do
you
know
whether
jose
gastelum
ever
attended
any
such
convention?”
“i
saw
him
at
one
convention,
one
time.”
“do
you
know
whether
he
was
there
on
official
capacity?”
“no.”
“that's
--
that's
the
total
of
the
testimony
and
i
submit
that
there
are
no
findings
made
by
the
bia.
you
will
find
nothing
in
the
bia
report
that
ever
mentions
that
petitioner
attended
the
convention.
and
i
say
that
this
decision
should
be
based
on
bia
findings
and
obviously
the
bia
did
not
consider
this
little
bit
of
testimony
to
have
any
significance.
otherwise,
i
assume
it
would
have
dwelt
on
it
and
said
that
its
finding
of
“meaningful
association”
was
based
upon
it
because
after
all
what
is
before
this
court
is
a
decision
of
the
bia
and
if
the
bia
says,
it
finds
“meaningful
association”
solely
on
bare
organizational
membership,
i
don't
think
it's
appropriate
for
the
government
to
argue
and
certainly
not
for
the
court
to
find
that
maybe
the
bia
is
wrong
on
that
theory
but
it
could
have
found
something
else.
that
flies
in
the
face
of
all
the
cases
in
this
court
in
reviewing
administrative
agency
decisions.
mr.
david
rein
the
bia
findings?
mr.
david
rein
well,
there
were
several
opinions
of
the
bia.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
have
quoted
from
the
transcript
on
page
6.
mr.
david
rein
yes
in
which
the
bia
made
the
following
statement,
and
this
was
referring
to
a
previous
decision
in
which
it
had.
it
said,
“membership
in
the
communist
party
was
found
to
have
been
established
on
the
testimony
of
government
witness,
scarletto,
who
testified
that
he
had
collected
communist
party
dues
from
the
respondent
and
had
attended
close
meetings
of
the
communist
party
with
him
and
the
general
corroboration
offered
by
the
testimony
of
government
witness,
elorriaga.
mr.
david
rein
there
were
not
detailed
findings,
i
submit.
there's
a
detail
account
on
what
the
testimony
was.
mr.
david
rein
well,
it
recites,
for
example,
at
page
2
at
great
length
what
elorriaga
testified
to
but
then
at
page
4
of
that
opinion,
it
points
out
that
elorriaga
contradicted
himself
and
that
he
was
not
going
to
make
any
findings
on
the
basis
of
his
testimony.
mr.
david
rein
yes,
but
i
say
that
you
would
come
to
no
different
conclusion
because
if
you
eliminate
their
account
of
what
elorriaga
testified
to
which
you
must
on
the
basis
of
what
they
said
at
page
4
of
that
same
opinion,
you
find
merely
scarletto's
testimony
and
that's
all
that
scarletto
testified
to
was
that
he
attended
meetings
with
the
respondent
and
that
the
respondent
pay
--
with
the
petitioner
and
that
the
petitioner
paid
dues.
there
isn't
anything
else
recited
any
place.
there
is
no
recital
for
example,
anywhere
in
here,
about
how
the
--
either
as
a
testimony
about
petitioner
attending
a
convention
at
any
time.
mr.
david
rein
yes.
mr.
david
rein
well,
that
comes
from
elo
--
elorriaga's
testimony.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
yes,
but
i
say
they're
no
different
from
what
i
said,
with
the
exception
of
that
other
matter
which
i
say
was
elorriaga's
testimony
and
was
discounted.
now
--
mr.
david
rein
1949
and
1950
prior
to
the
korean
war.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
think
that's
the
heart
of
the
case
as
to
who
has
to
prove
deportability.
now
first,
let
me
get
down
to
the
point
that
if
rowoldt
held
and
the
meaning
of
the
rowoldt
decision
is
what
had
to
be
proved
before
an
alien
could
be
brought
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
rowoldt
did
not
testify
at
the
deportation
proceeding.
rowoldt
gave
a
pre-hearing
statement
to
an
immigration
officer
which
was
the
sole
evidence
introduced
against
rowoldt
at
the
deportation
proceeding,
but
at
the
deportation
proceeding
itself,
rowoldt
like
the
petitioner
here,
refused
to
testify.
now,
there
was
nothing
in
rowoldt
that
lent
sanction
to
the
idea
that
it
laid
down
a
new
novel
rule
of
method
of
proof
or
to
suggest
that
the
situation
would
have
been
any
different
as
to
whether
the
testimony
came
from
rowoldt
or
whether
it
came
from
any
place
else.
now
the
important
point
to
note
here
is
what
did
rowoldt
decide?
rowoldt
decided
that
an
alien
is
not
deportable
unless
there
is
a
“meaningful
association.”
now,
it
is
clear
and
i
don't
think
the
government
disputes
that
the
burden
of
proof
in
all
deportation
cases
rests
upon
the
government.
if
it
is
an
element
of
deportability,
that
“meaningful
association”
must
be
shown
and
that
burden
of
proof
rests
upon
the
government.
so
that
if
you
have
a
record
here
which
shows
membership
and
gives
you
no
light
whatsoever
on
whether
or
not
that
there
is
a
“meaningful
association”,
the
government
has
not
carried
its
burden
of
proof
and
the
case
must
be
thrown
out.
mr.
david
rein
well
--
mr.
david
rein
i
submit
no,
it's
not
a
possible
distinction.
if
you
can
make
inferences
from
which
are
in
the
record,
they
must
be
sufficient
inferences
to
support
your
burden
of
proof
in
the
first
place.
and
then
you
could
say
--
mr.
david
rein
i
don't
have
to
argue
that
case
here.
you
might
say
that
attending
meetings
regularly
every
week
is
enough
to
show
the
“meaningful
association,”
but
that's
not
a
question
of
making
an
inference
which
shifts
the
burden
of
proof.
the
question
would
be
whether
the
government
had
proved
enough
to
bring
him
within
rowoldt.
i
say
and
there's
particularly
no
reason,
it's
a
very
novel
rule
of
law.
it's
never
been
applied
in
any
other
deportation
case
that
i
know
of
to
say
that
any
element
of
the
deportability
should
be
shifted
to
the
alien
and
does
not
rest
upon
the
government.
and
i
might
indicate
that
--
mr.
david
rein
no,
i'm
not
--
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
the
answer
to
that
clearly
is
no.
mr.
david
rein
because
rowoldt
says
that
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
galvan,
despite
the
language
of
the
statute
is
not
enough
to
be
deportable,
that
you
must
show
more.
mr.
david
rein
you
must
show
membership
which
is
meaningful
according
to
rowoldt
--
mr.
david
rein
--
which
contains
necessary
political
implications.
well,
galvan
didn't
explore
it.
may
i
point
that
scales
went
on
to
say
in
interpreting
the
word
“member”
there
that
you
had
to
be
an
active
member.
there
was
no
notion
that
you
could
be
convicted
as
a
member
under
the
smith
act
unless
the
defendant
came
in
and
said,
he
was
not
an
active
member
and
this
court
--
mr.
david
rein
it
said
member.
it
had
just
the
term
member.
mr.
david
rein
member
in
an
organization
that
advocates
the
overthrow
of
government
by
force
and
violence.
mr.
david
rein
well,
may
i
say
that
this
court
thought
it
was
the
same
question
because
it
argued
on
the
basis
of
rowoldt
and
galvan
that
you
should
have
a
similar
construction
in
scales
as
the
court
had
previously
given
to
the
rowoldt
case.
and
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
in
rowoldt
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
think
i
have
but
let's
--
leaving
that
aside,
there
is
no
question
that
rowoldt
held
that
it
is
not
enough
to
prove
just
membership
in
the
communist
party
that
you
have
to
prove
something
more.
mr.
david
rein
no.
mr.
david
rein
well
yes,
it
held
what
was
necessary
for
the
deportability
--
mr.
david
rein
--
and
i
would
assume
--
i
would
assume
from
the
decision,
i
think
there's
no
reason.
now,
let
me
correct
myself.
i
think
rowoldt
probably
read
--
did
say
something
about
the
burden
of
proof
and
if
i
refer
to
the
language
of
rowoldt,
i
would
indicate
this
is
what
rowoldt
said
insofar
as
it
commented
on
the
point.
it
said
and
i
quote
from
rowoldt,
“there
must
be
a
substantial
basis
of
finding
meaningful
membership
and
a
solidity
of
proof
is
required.”
now,
i
submit
it
did
not
consider
the
issue
on
the
terms
on
which
is
being
presented
here
as
to
whether
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
alien
or
on
the
government.
what
--
obviously
the
idea
that
the
burden
of
proof
of
any
element
of
deportability
should
be
upon
the
alien
is
a
novel
and
new
idea.
rowoldt
didn't
say
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
government
it
just
assumed
it
because
the
burden
of
proof
and
deportability
is
always
on
the
government.
and
if
this
government
wishes
to
make
a
new
suggestion,
i
might
indicate
incidentally
for
what
its
worth
that
the
government
does
not
support
in
its
brief
or
argue
the
validity
of
the
bia
theory
that
is
possible
to
shift
his
burden
of
proof.
it
simply
abandons
the
whole
question.
i
don't
know
what
view
we'll
have
in
argument
but
its
brief
is
silent
on
the
point.
but
deportation,
even
though
the
court
has
found
that
it's
technically,
perhaps
not
punishment
in
the
legal
sense,
this
court
has
recognized
on
numerous
occasions,
the
harsh
consequences
of
a
deportation
statute.
in
galvan
it
recognized
the
harsh
consequences
and
the
unjust
character
of
this
particular
statute.
and
i
would
certainly
suggest
to
the
court
that
certainly
this
case
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
court
should
invent
novel
rules
of
proof
and
novel
rules
of
the
order
of
proof
and
the
burden
of
proof
so
as
to
make
it
easier
for
the
government
to
make
out
a
case
against
aliens
and
against
this
petitioner
then
normally
apply
in
ordinary
administrative
hearings.
i
am
certainly
asking
for
no
more
than
the
application
of
the
novel
rules
of
proof
in
administrative
proceedings
generally.
the
government
and
the
bia
would
be
asking
to
carve
out
an
exception
for
a
case
of
this
kind
to
say
that
in
this
case,
the
burden
rests
not
upon
the
government
but
upon
the
alien,
and
i
say
there
is
no
justice
in
that
kind
of
a
--
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
that's
exactly
my
position.
mr.
david
rein
that
is
exactly
my
position,
that
there
just
is
not
enough
evidence
and
that
it
cannot
be
bolstered
by
saying
that
even
though
there
is
not
enough
evidence
to
support
the
order,
he's
deportable
because
he
didn't
come
forward
to
show
that
he
was
not
deportable.
i
say
that
--
mr.
david
rein
i
think
it
would
be
much
preferable
for
the
court
to
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
made
out
here
rather
than
on
the
--
i
agree
that
the
aberrations
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
probably
no
part
of
the
issue
before
the
court
here
and
need
not
be
--
and
it
would
not
be
appropriate
and
necessarily
for
the
court
to
consider
it.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
that
if
the
burden
is
on
the
government,
that
if
the
alien
is
not
deportable
unless
the
membership
is
shown
to
have
a
“meaningful
association”
and
the
burden
and
that
is
an
element
of
deportability
as
much
as
any
other
element
--
mr.
david
rein
no,
i
say
it's
consistent
with
experience
to
show
that
membership
in
the
communist
party
may
or
may
not
be
meaningful
or
meaningless
and
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
rowoldt
case
itself
shows
that.
that
there
are
number
of
cases
which
were
decided
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
basis
of
the
rowoldt
doctrine
where
they
found
that
the
membership
was
not
meaningful
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
has
held
that
too.
i
say
you
can't
draw
any
inference
one
way
or
the
other.
i
don't
have
to
say
that
the
fair
inference
is
that
it
was
meaningless.
and
may
i
point
out
that
even
in
rowoldt
--
mr.
david
rein
that
the
government
hasn't
shown
that
it's
meaningful.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
that
is
right.
that
is
not
because
it's
a
fair
inference
that
mere
membership
is
meaningless,
but
it's
a
fair
inference
--
mr.
david
rein
that
it
may
be
even
meaningful
or
meaningless
depending
on
certain
other
circumstances
which
have
not
been
presented
here
in
which
the
record
is
barren.
in
other
words,
if
you
can
draw
either
inference
the
government
hasn't
supported
their
burden
of
proof.
mr.
david
rein
it
may
be.
mr.
david
rein
it
may
be.
mr.
david
rein
without
more,
that's
correct.
just
membership
alone
doesn't
show
that
there
was
a
“meaningful
association”
and
i
don't
see
any
other
way
to
read
rowoldt,
and
let
me
--
mr.
david
rein
with
all
--
mr.
david
rein
no.
mr.
david
rein
i'm
not
--
mr.
david
rein
i'm
not
arguing
that.
i'm
saying
that
it
must
be
shown
some
activities
within
the
communist
party,
not
within
the
proscribed
activities,
but
something
--
let's
for
example
take
what
this
court
had
in
niukkanen.
mr.
david
rein
no,
that
was
the
reason
he
was
given
for
joining
the
communist
party
but
he
knew
he
was
joining
the
communist
party,
it
was
a
voluntary
joining
of
the
communist
party
and
he
attended
meetings
and
paid
dues
and
he
did
more.
he
ran
a
party
bookstore
--
mr.
david
rein
--
and
the
court
--
mr.
david
rein
no.
i
--
mr.
david
rein
i
beg
to
get
through
with
you,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
think
the
point
the
majority
looked
at
it
was
that
you
had
to
show
more
than
just
membership
to
bring
you
within
the
scope
of
the
statute
then
that's
the
--
the
gist
of
rowoldt.
mr.
david
rein
well,
let
me
give
you
an
example.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
and
then
i
think
i
probably
would
have
been
out
of
court
if
your
views
have
been
accepted
at
the
present
time,
but
i'm
arguing
on
the
basis
of
the
majority
opinion.
now,
let
me
give
you
an
example
--
for
example,
it
means
--
this
is
presented
as
somewhat
of
a
dilemma.
this
court
has
recently
since
niukkan
--
since
rowoldt
has
had
one
other
case
in
which
it
considered
the
meaning
of
rowoldt
and
what
had
to
be
proved
and
that
was
the
niukkanen
case.
now,
the
court
there
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
the
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
find
in
niukkanen?
it
didn't
find
just
that
he
was
a
member.
they
found
that
niukkanen
actively
participated
in
discussions
of
the
policies
of
the
party
and
the
circulation
of
newspaper
as
a
party
order.
they
found
that
niukkanen
was
not
an
ordinary
member
of
the
communist
party,
but
belonged
to
what
members
of
the
party
called
the
“top
fraction,”
and
that
he
actively
participated
in
party
councils.
now,
these
are
not
necessarily
related
to
the
proscribed
activities
of
illegal
overthrow,
but
it
was
necessary
to
find
and
niukkanen
did
found
--
it
find
into
the
court
in
niukkanen
--
the
court
of
appeals
in
niukkanen
did
find
and
this
court
sustained
him
that
there
was
activity
of
some
kind,
an
activity
of
a
responsible
nature
sufficiently
to
show
a
“meaningful
association”.
and
i
submit
that
that
is
the
burden
on
the
government
under
rowoldt
and
under
any
other
logical
--
i
mean
in
view
of
the
deportation
statute.
and
let
me
make
this
final
word
with
respect
to
it,
that
this
statute
has
been
sustained.
its
constitutionality
has
been
sustained,
and
was
sustained
in
galvan
against
press.
the
court
later
recognized
that
it
would
sustain
what
it
considered
to
be
purely
historical
reasons.
it's
been
sustained
on
a
theory
that
after
all
deportation
is
not
punishment,
but
the
court
has
recognized
consistently
although
not
punishment
in
the
legal
sense
the
consequences
of
deporting
an
alien,
who
has
lived
here
all
his
life
and
has
his
roots
here,
has
extremely
harsh
consequences.
i
submit
that
in
a
--
that
type
of
case,
there
is
no
reason
whatsoever
to
relax
the
normal
rules
of
the
standard
of
proof
and
the
burden
of
proof
assuming
that
we
have
this
harsh
statute
and
because
of
the
nature,
this
harsh
nature
of
the
statute,
if
the
petitioner
and
the
evidence
brings
the
petitioner
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
as
interpreted
by
this
court,
then
he
is
unfortunately
deportable
and
these
harsh
consequences
must
be
visited
on
him.
but
i
see
no
reason
whatsoever
why
the
government
or
this
court
should
stretch
anything
to
force
him
within
the
scope
of
the
statute
rather
than
outside.
mr.
david
rein
i'm
not
--
mr.
david
rein
i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
go
one
with
--
beyond
the
extent
to
which
it
went
in
the
rowoldt
case.
and
i
submit
that
what
the
government
is
asking
here,
is
asking
the
court,
and
if
the
court
did
stretch
in
rowoldt,
i
think
that
that
is
the
law
i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
go
beyond
it.
the
government
is
asking
the
court
to
retreat
from
rowoldt
and
now
establish
a
new
standard
at
a
much
more
stricter
--
stringent
standard
of
proof
that
was
applied
in
the
rowoldt
case.
now,
i
think
that's
what
this
case
comes
down
to.
mr.
david
rein
well,
except
that
rowoldt
attended
certainly
as
many
meetings
and
the
point
about
rowoldt
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
don't
think
that
that
--
if
i
may
submit
it,
that
if
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
prove
something,
i
think
the
absence
of
evidence
is
in
the
favor
of
the
petitioner
rather
than
against
it
as
against
rowoldt.
mr.
david
rein
well,
the
record
is
un-contradicted
here
to
that
extent
too,
but
the
point
about
rowoldt
--
mr.
david
rein
--
is
that
rowoldt
said
--
i'm
sorry,
if
i
may
finish
my
sentence.
mr.
david
rein
that
rowoldt
said,
“that
you
can't
deport
someone
solely
on
the
ground
of
evidence
that
he's
a
member.
there
must
be
something
more.”
mr.
david
rein
well,
un-contradicted
that
he
was
a
member.
but
it
said
it
lacked
the
necessary
extra
thing
of
“meaningful
association”
and
political
understanding
of
the
political
implications
of
this
joining.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
submit,
really
--
it
can't
logically
be
read
any
other
way
than
to
say
that
once
you
know
that
a
man
is
a
member,
he
is
not
deportable
unless
you
show
something
more
which
will
show
“meaningful
association.”
mr.
david
rein
no,
i
submit
that
he
could
not
possibly
be
read
in
that
fashion
because
it
would
be
creating
a
new
doctrine
in
deportation
orders
about
shifting
burden
of
proof
--
mr.
david
rein
certainly,
there's
nothing
--
mr.
david
rein
well,
it's
certainly
--
mr.
david
rein
but
certainly
nothing
in
rowoldt
that
says
that.
mr.
david
rein
well,
i
think
it
does
change
the
burden
of
proof.
i
don't
understand
that
if
a
membership
is
enough
to
make
a
man
deportable
now
what
is
it
that
rowoldt
showed?
he
showed
that
he
was
a
member
and
there
he
won
--
that
he
was
still
a
member
after
he
presented
his
evidence.
he
didn't
disproved
the
government's
--
mr.
david
rein
yes.
he
didn't
disprove
the
government,
its
evidence
that
he
was
a
member.
mr.
david
rein
that's
correct.
mr.
david
rein
no.
there's
no
evidence
that
he
ever
did
anything
(voice
overlap)
in
connection
with
the
communist
party.
mr.
david
rein
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
rein
well,
let
me
say
just
this
very
briefly
--
mr.
david
rein
that
is
--
mr.
david
rein
that
is
correct
and
that's
the
way
i
read
it
and
to
read
it
any
other
way
means
that
once
the
government
shows
membership
that
the
--
you
would
have
to
assume
that
rowoldt
had
presented
some
evidence
to
disprove
that
he
was
a
member
and
he
did
not
do
that.
mr.
david
rein
i'd
like
briefly
to
discuss
the
point
about
the
actual
findings
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
as
mr.
terris
has
indicated,
the
board
first
made
its
findings
before
rowoldt.
the
petition
for
reopen
was
filed
asking
it
to
reconsider
the
case
in
the
base
--
on
the
basis
of
rowoldt
or
at
least
to
reopen.
and
it's
significant
that
in
that
decision,
in
which
it
considered
the
meaning
of
rowoldt,
this
is
what
the
board
said
it
had
found
and
what
its
findings
were.
and
here
are
findings
at
page
--
it
appears
at
page
6
of
the
transcript,
membership
in
the
communist
party
was
found
to
have
been
established
on
the
testimony
of
government
witness,
scarletto,
who
testified
that
he
had
collected
communist
party
dues
from
the
respondent
and
had
attended
closed
meetings
of
the
communist
party
with
him,
and
the
general
corroboration
offered
by
the
testimony
of
government
witness,
elorriaga.
those
are
your
findings
are
meant,
the
board
goes
on
to
say
at
page
8,
there
was
little
development
of
the
respondent's
awareness
of
the
fact
that
he
belonged
to
a
political
organization.
when
the
case
went
back,
it
wasn't
at
the
question
of
the
respondent
not
offering
evidence,
the
government
offered
no
evidence.
and
mind
you,
in
this
particular
case,
they
had
a
witness
who
was
an
undercover
informant
for
the
fbi
who
according
to
the
government
had
observed
the
respondent
over
a
considerable
period
of
time
and
had
adequate
opportunity
to
testify
to
anything
that
he
did.
the
fair
inference
to
draw
from
the
lack
of
any
testimony
is
that
there
was
no
test
--
there
was
no
activity
to
testify
to.
and
i
submit
that
where
the
government
has
an
opportunity
to
present
testimony
of
“meaningful
association,”
has
witnesses
who
would
have
knowledge
or
that
if
there
were
and
presents
no
such
testimony,
it
is
certainly
as
fair
an
inference
to
conclude
there
was
no
“meaningful
association”
rather
than
to
say
that
the
government
had
to
prove
it.
one
last
point
--
mr.
david
rein
no.
scarletto,
the
one
on
which
the
board
relied
was
the
undercover
informant
for
the
fbi.
mr.
david
rein
scarletto.
mr.
david
rein
the
other
one,
the
board
indicated,
they
could
not
rely
in
his
testimony.
i
wanted
have
one
further
point.
there's
been
much
discussion
here
that
rowoldt
joined
the
communist
party
merely
to
get
something
to
eat.
i
wanted
to
indicate
and
i
want
to
read
now
from
the
opinion
in
rowoldt,
in
which
rowoldt,
the
court
says,
rowoldt
then
explains
his
reasons
for
joining
the
communist
party,
“the
purpose
was
probably
this.
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
came
hand
in
hand,
the
communist
party
and
the
fight
for
bread.
it
seemed
to
me
like
this.
let's
put
it
this
way
that
the
communist
party
and
the
workers'
alliance
had
one
aim
to
get
something
to
eat
for
the
people.
i
didn't
know
it
was
against
the
law
for
aliens
to
join
the
communist
party
and
the
workers'
alliance.”
now,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
rowoldt
was
not
joining
the
communist
party
to
get
a
hand
out.
he
did
not
think
it
was
a
salvation
army.
he
joined
it
as
an
organization
which
he
thought
would
help
get
people
food
generally.
it
was
not
personally
to
get
food.
now,
i
just
want
to
make
that
point
clear.
thank
you.
