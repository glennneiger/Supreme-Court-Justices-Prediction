justice

black
where
are
these
findings
that
you
referred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
make
separate
findings,
that's
what
i
was
asking?
justice
hugo
l.
black
six?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

did
he
not
that
he
paid
party
dues.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
worked
without
pay
in
the
communist
bookshop
for
a
long
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
this
man
work
in
the
communist
bookshop
and
sold
communist
books?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
he
did
anything
more
than
what
is
said
and
what
i
think
was
a
correct
statement
of
the
fact
that
justice
harlan
has
said
at
page
125
that
he
was
freely
admitted,
he
was
a
member
of
the
party
about
a
year,
he
paid
party
dues,
that
he
attended
party
meetings,
worked
without
pay
at
the
party
bookstore
which
was
recognized
as
an
official
outlet
for
communist
liberty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
do
you
see
as
to
that,
here,
that's
in
there
that
in
the
case
that
somehow
the
--
that
destroyed
the
government's
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
fact
if
they
held
that
was
meaningful
membership,
if
it
had
to
be
more
than
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
more
solidity
in
the
mere
membership.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
they
find
on
page
2?
they
found,
did
they
not,
that
the
membership
was
voluntary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
found
in
rowoldt
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
found
in
rowoldt
about
the
voluntary
membership?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
what
was
meant
by
that,
not
enough,
as
you
understand
rowoldt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
rowoldt
modified
it
to
the
extent
that
it
must
be,
did
it
not,
whatever
it
is
meant
by
meaningful
and
the
court
--
where
the
court
had
and
had
this
validity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
understand
you're
thinking
that
rowoldt
is
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
it's
difficult
for
me
to
see
the
distinction
which
is
attempted
to
be
drawn
between
this
case
and
rowoldt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
by
the
board
which
said
it
was
voluntary
and
it
was
voluntary
in
rowoldt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
had
galvan
said
anything
about
having
been
meaningful
and
more
than
membership?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
had?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
it
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
isn't
every
bit
of
that
proven
in
rowoldt?
wasn't
everything
there
you
said
proven
in
rowoldt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
mean
then
if
this
man
had
taken
the
stand
and
said,
he
joined
it
for
other
than
political
reasons,
he
couldn't
have
been
deported
under
rowoldt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
mean
it
has
to
be
precise
--
just
precisely
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
--
the
dissent
took
the
other
view,
didn't
it?
the
dissent
took
the
view
that
that
proved
enough
in
rowoldt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
the
court
said
was
it
meant
--
may
well
have
been
devoid
of
any
political
implications.
but
i
do
not
read
the
opinion
as
resting
on
that
fact.
i
read
it
as
resting
on
the
fact
that
entails
a
consequence
of
deportation
and
it
applies
more
solidity
of
proof
than
was
[inaudible]
--
that
was
held
there
which
was
fairly
set
out
in
the
dissent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
didn't
say
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
say
that
the
evidence
showed
it
was
devoid
of
political
implications
in
the
opinion
here,
as
i
read
it.
i
agree
with
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
agree
readily
on
it
that
the
test
is
a
very
loose
one
of
what
is
meaningful,
but
i
have
found
a
difficulty
of
this
term,
up
to
this
time,
why
--
that
was
not
as
much
or
more
have
justified
deportation
in
rowoldt
as
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he's
been
a
member
a
year.
he
went
to
all
the
meetings,
paid
his
dues,
and
in
addition
to
that,
worked
in
the
communist
bookstore.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
show
that
it
takes
a
pretty
heavy
burden
somewhere
as
to
the
kind
of
meaningful
membership
it
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
suppose
anybody
doubted
it
in
1935?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
had
--
they
were
running
candidates
to
various
places
there.
i
should
think
that
it
was
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
a
reason
to
believe
that
that
was
a
political
organization
then.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
thought
he
told
them
when
he
--
when
they
asked
him
that,
but
he
also
paid
dues
and
went
to
meetings,
attended
meetings
regularly
for
a
year.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
was
that
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
of
the
two
witnesses
testified
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
was
read
from
awhile
ago
as
to
the
effect
that
they
were
--
they
didn't
have
to
resolve
that
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
board
decide
that
he
was
an
official?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
it
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
very
unsatisfactory
set
of
findings.
you
say
whether
or
not
the
board
found
the
facts,
sufficient
to
show
that
he
had
a
meaningful
membership.
i
can't
tell
which
part
of
its
findings
and
which
part
of
it
is
just
to
say
that
there
was
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
see
that
they
said
that
he
was
a
voluntary
member.
they
found
that
very
clearly
and
specifically.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
what
--
where
are
the
findings
on
which
they
based
that?
i
mean
the
findings
of
fact,
not
their
conclusion
that
was
meaningful
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
did
not
make
any
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
findings
of
fact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
we
have
to
look
back
at
page
2.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
the
part,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
very
unsatisfactory,
the
findings
of
fact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
what
rowoldt
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
that's
your
difference.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they're
having
no
additional
findings
of
facts.
rowoldt
had
been
a
man
here
40
years.
the
court
took
that
into
the
consideration.
how
long
have
this
man
been
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
43
years.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
indication
in
the
record
that
he's
ever
done
anything
unlawful
unless
he
was
joining
the
communist
party
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
within
that
43
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
was
no
idea
that
this
man
didn't
know
what
he
was
doing,
rowoldt,
was
there
except
the
same
as
a
normal
man
who
was
working
in
a
bookstore.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
galvan,
i'm
talking
about
rowoldt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
it
didn't
quite
say
that.
it
said
that
he
was
not
devoid
of
evidence
from
which
it
might
be
inferred
that
he
joined
for
something
else
besides
political
reasons.
but
that
case
unless
i'm
wrong
that
i
rest
on
this,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
who
wrote
it
that
deportation
is
a
very,
very
serious
thing.
it
must
not
be
lightly
considered
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
should
occur,
particularly
in
reference
the
man
has
been
there
40
years
and
that
it's
got
to
be
something
more
than
membership.
this
man
had
membership.
that
was
--
it
was
the
approach
that
the
court
took
to
the
effect
of
deportation
on
the
man.
and
i
don't
see
where
it
could
be
said
that
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
engraft
a
modification
of
their
meaningful
modification
on
galvan.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
dissent
has
pointed
out
that
there
wasn't
much
difference,
didn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
said
that
it's
not
accurately
stated
what
the
facts
were.
justice
hugo
l.
black
unless
you
can
show
they
didn't.
and
the
argument
said
the
opposite.
no,
they
didn't
say
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
majority
decided
and
it
did
with
the
knowledge
with
the
fact
stated
as
the
dissent
was
correct.
they
could
not
be
disputed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
hope
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
hope
you
have
argued
on
the
basis
a
little
more
than
that
in
it
for
this
reason.
there
should
be
findings
of
fact
by
the
agency
charged
with
the
findings
of
facts
that
it's
sufficient
to
support
the
conclusion.
i
do
not
think
we
should
be
required
to
wade
through
this
evidence
of
how
much
there
is
to
make
findings
which
the
board
failed
to
make.
and
for
me,
as
to
my
way
of
thinking,
they
have
not
made
adequate
finding
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
subsidiary
facts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
challenge
was
to
the
fact
that
he
said
that
to
read
that
page
is
--
when
i
read
it,
i
felt
to
agree
with
but
it's
largely
just
a
recital
of
evidence.
it's
hard
to
tell
what
facts
are
found
except
that
this
man
voluntarily
joined
the
party.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
nobody
denied.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
first
sentence
and
that
last
sentence
from
the
paragraph
relates
to
whether
his
membership
was
voluntary.
that
finding
is
that
he
was
a
voluntary
member
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
nobody
denied.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
voluntary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
those
facts
that
they
had
there,
if
you
call
that
a
finding
of
fact,
relate
to
being
voluntary.
they
do
not,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
the
facts
they've
stated
there,
if
you
call
them
findings,
do
not
support
any
different
kind
of
membership
to
that
of
rowoldt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
paragraph
--
in
that
paragraph?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
if
--
you
mean
--
i
thought
that
--
it's
pretty
well
settled
that
if
an
agency
made
findings,
subsidiary
findings,
we
look
to
them
to
make
the
findings
and
we
didn't
go
look
to
see
if
other
findings
could
have
been
made
by
them
from
other
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
might
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
might
be
where
you
can
see
now,
which
part
of
this
do
you
think
is
a
subsidiary
finding
different
to
rowoldt.
testimony
introduced
by
the
government
reveals
that
respondent's
membership
continued
over
a
period
from
1948
or
1949
to
at
least
end
of
1950.
that's
a
difference
in
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
that
for
several
months
an
attempt
was
made
to
make
the
respondent
a
leading
figure
in
the
unit
of
the
communist
party.
justice
hugo
l.
black
totally
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
it
--
would
you
think
if
that
was
sufficient
to
show
that
he
was
an
official
that
the
fact
that
several
months,
somebody
made
an
effort
to
make
him
a
leading
figure
in
the
unit
of
the
communist
party?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
as
a
serious
finding
that
this
man
was
an
official
of
the
communist
party.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
--
that
--
i
agree
to
that.
the
respondent
paid
dues
over
the
period
of
his
membership,
that's
rowoldt
and
attended
many
meetings,
he
claimed
close
to
all
but
members
of
the
communist
party.
that's
rowoldt,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
they
said
that
this
testimony
established
a
prima
facie
case
of
voluntary
membership,
and
you
say
that
we
should
substitute
for
that,
i
agree
that
that
could
be
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
that
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
sufficient
and
that
judgment
to
show
meaningful.
that's
what
they
rested
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
called
your
attention
to.
would
you
say
that
these
facts
which
i've
read
to
you
that
this
was
meaningful
in
there
in
the
beginning
would
have
distinguished
this
from
rowoldt
sufficiently?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
what
your
case
hangs
on?
you're
not
asking
us,
are
you,
to
go
look
over
this
record.
read
all
the
evidence
and
make
findings
of
our
own
in
addition
to
these.
justice
hugo
l.
black
evidence
to
support
these
findings.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
do
i
understand
that
the
government
--
i
want
to
know
this
in
connection
with
government
cases.
the
government
is
now
taking
the
position
is
when
their
agencies
make
findings
of
specific
facts
that
we
ought
to
go
out
and
look
beyond
those
each
time
we
have
an
agency
determination
to
see
if
we
could
find
--
make
some
more
findings
from
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
mean
they
told
them
in
advance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
my
trouble
in
the
questions
i've
asked
you
is
not
that.
i
understood
that
that
was
the
fact.
i
understood
that
the
board,
when
he
get
back
said
they
found
--
what
they
found
before
to
show
meaningfulness
within
rowoldt.
my
trouble
is
that
i
do
not
think
what
they
did
find,
brings
it
in
rowoldt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
rowoldt
hadn't
come
forward.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
your
case
depend
on
our
taking
at
that
adopting
a
theory
that
we
believe
when
a
man
is
being
deported
or
when
a
man
was
being
tried
for
something,
and
the
government
failed
to
put
up
enough
evidence,
somehow
when
he
puts
up
a
certain
amount,
changes
the
duty,
and
makes
him
--
go
follow
it
to
put
on
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
hope
it
doesn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
he
knew
he
was
joining
political
organization
that
is
[inaudible]
in
rowoldt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
your
argument
is
that
there's
enough
evidence
for
them
to
find
that
he
knew
he's
joining
political
organization
that
brings
it
in
rowoldt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i've
never
been
able
to
understand
that
difference.
i
tried
to
explain
my
difficulty,
the
first
year
i
was
on
this
court,
an
explanation
that
i've
never
been
able
to
understand
that
there's
any
distinction
between
those
two
ideas.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
how
would
it
be
different
from
that?
it's
like
that
disappearing
