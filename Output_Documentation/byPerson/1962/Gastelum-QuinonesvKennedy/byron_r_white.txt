is
it
your
view
that
the
court
of
appeals
overruled

against

even

erroneous.

how
many
did
he
go
to?
justice
byron

white
he
went
to
all
of
them.
justice
byron

white
but
he
said
that
it
could've
been
15
times
or
could
be
more
that
he
recalled
seeing
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
said,
it
could
be
15,
it
could
be
more.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could've
been
every
week.
justice
byron

white
in
could've
been
every
week?
justice
byron

white
so,
i
gather
you
would
indicate
that
fair
membership
in
the
communist
party
is
unless
shown
otherwise
meaningless
membership
and
--
if
all
you
show
is
a
membership
and
haven't
shown
anything
meaningful,
you
must
show
something
besides
membership.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
it
--
and
your
contention
is
that,
that
there's
no
ground
for
saying
that
membership
in
an
organization
like
the
communist
party
is
meaningful
and
that
all
go
into
a
certain
case,
a
person
might
be
able
to
show
that
it
isn't
meaningful
doesn't
have
the
burden
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it's
consistent
with
experience
to
what
the
--
knowledge
about
the
communist
party
do
you
say
that
membership
of
the
communist
party
is
normally
meaningful?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
to
say
and
you
do
have
to
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.

now,
do
you
have
to
say
that
the
--
and
you
are
saying
that
the
government
must
show
more
than
membership.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
must
go
on
and
show
that
it's
meaningful.
if
they
haven't
shown
that
it's
meaningful,
if
they
just
show
membership,
in
account
of
(voice

justice
byron

white
meaningful
or
meaningless
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
saying
then
that
it's
a
--
that
membership
in
a
communist
party
is
absolutely
[inaudible]
and
it's
the
--
that
its
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
--
it's
the
fact
that
--
the
fact
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
doesn't
point
one
way
or
another.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
go
right
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
it
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
isn't
shifting
any
burden
of
proof,
you're
just
saying
that
burden
of
proof
is
satisfied
when
as
the
matter
of
common
experience
you
attach
the
membership
the
fact
that
it's
a
meaningful
membership,
it's
not
just
that
i
don't
think
he'd
join
the
communist
party.
and
that
your
burden
of
proof
is
completely
satisfied
when
you
show
membership.
this
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
way
--
you
satisfy
your
burden
in
your
--
at
least
you
get
by
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
get
by
anything
else
by
showing
that
you
--
that
made
your
case
and
that
somebody
does
something
to
it
which
destroys
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
rowoldt,
the
government
case
was
destroyed.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
change
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
terris,
you
truly
lose
me
along
the
way
when
you
say
that
rowoldt
having
more
than
membership
and
that
you
must
have
more
than
membership
and
the
government
must
show
meaningful
membership.
that's
your
burden
of
proof
that
you
must
satisfy.
that's
your
position,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
there
any
evidence
to
support
that
other
than
nowhere
here
on
page
72
of
the
record?
i
don't
know
where
is
that
page
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it's
at
69.
all
i
know
at
that
time
he
was
an
official
of
the
club
because
he
attended
a
few
executive
meetings.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
there
was
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
gather
mr.
terris,
you
concede
that
it
wouldn't
be
proper
for
us
--
at
least
we
don't
have
to
--
put
it
the
first
way,
it
wouldn't
be
proper
for
us
to
support
the
findings
of
meaningfulness
by
any
facts
in
the
record
other
than
in
that
paragraph.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
we
could
find
our
judgment
about
meaningfulness
or
not
with
the
facts
in
that
paragraph,
or
are
you
urging
us
to
look
to
some
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
--
i
know
you
think
those
are
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
for
example
the
attempt
to
make
him
a
leading
figure,
for
example,
encompasses
any
specific
evidence
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
such
as
he
was
an
official.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
went
outside
those
findings
and
took
a
--
found
something
in
the
record
that
was
entirely
independent
of
those
findings,
different
and
said
this
supports
the
meaningfulness,
do
we
have
a
plenary
problem
here
or
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
different
theory.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
includes
that
he
was
in
fact
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
mr.
terris
before
it
said
later
that
it
is
meaningful
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
board
later
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
itself
said
it
on
these
facts,
it
is
meaningful
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
not
just
voluntary.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
didn't
offer
any
evidence
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
after
the
chance
--
that
was
after
the
chance
to
offer
evidence.
they
had
to
make
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
both
their
minds,
didn't
they,
in
advanced
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
whether
they
would
or
would
not
for
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
he
rested
at
that
point
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
there
was
no
more
evidence,
you've
won
your
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
made
by
the
burden
is
that
if
he
wants
to
win
this
case
is
that
--
if
defendant
wants
to
win
the
case
that
time,
he
better
do
something
about
your
case.
