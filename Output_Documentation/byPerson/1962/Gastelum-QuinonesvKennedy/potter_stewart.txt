stewart
he
was
never
a
naturalized
citizen?
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
not
preceded
by
the
nationalization
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
you
know
where
that
is
in
the
record
off
hand?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rein,
i
--
don't
we
have
to
begin
with
the
statute?
and
the
statute
as
it's
set
out
on
page
2
of
your
brief,
says
that
the
--
i'm
talking
about
the
immigration
nationality
act
provides
that
a
person
shall
be
deported
who
at
any
time
after
entry
has
been
an
alien
who
is
a
member
of
or
affiliated
with
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states.
now,
you
--
certainly
you're
not
--
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
government
did
not
prove
that
this
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
after
he
was
--
after
he
entered
united
states,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
rowoldt,
as
i
understand
the
government's
argument
at
least
says
that
the
terms
of
the
--
that
the
--
to
be
sure
the
statute
says
that,
but
if
it
can
be
shown
affirmatively
by
the
petitioner,
that
he
wasn't
--
that
his
membership
was
not
a
political
kind
of
a
membership,
that
it
was
not
as
you
say
a
meaningful
membership
as
the
--
the
court
said
in
that
case,
then
he
doesn't
come
within
the
statute,
but
isn't
it
enough
beginning
with
the
statute
which
is
where
it
normally
begins
for
the
government
to
prove
his
membership
and
certainly
that
was
proven
here,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
why?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
must
under
galvan
show
knowing
membership
and
didn't
the
government
show
that
here?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
talking
about
galvan.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
scales
didn't
involve
the
statute
which
had
--
which
talked
about
membership
in
the
communist
party,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
communist
party?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
might
have
been
a
question
under
the
criminal
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
did
rowoldt
say
anything
about
the
burden
of
proof?
justice
potter
stewart
so
rowoldt
didn't
hold
that
it
was
not
enough
for
the
government
just
to
prove
membership,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
and
on
page
14,
of
the
final
paragraph
there,
they
explained
that
their
first
opinion
in
which
it
satisfies
them
that
the
membership
was
meaningful.
