that
the
issue
is
even
narrowly
made
on
this
record,
on
which
you
relied,
rowoldt
and
galvan.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,

[inaudible]
that's
what
we're
down
to
for
the
purposes
of
our
--

view
in
(voice

justice
william

that
was
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,

as
i
understand
it,
mr.
terris,
mr.
rein
has
made
it
very
clear.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
problem
is
that
this
case
rowoldt
or
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
old
is
he
now,
mr.
terris?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
there's
much
emphasis
on
it,
was
not
in
niukkanen
on
the
finding
of
the
two
courts
below
at
least
to
the
[inaudible]
i've
forgotten.
that
niukkanen
had
pressured
himself
and
the

judge
say,
--
justice

--
“pressured
himself

justice
william
j.
brennan,

mr.
terris,
may
i
ask
another
--
a
different
question
to
you.
i
think
rowoldt
involved
the
membership
in
the
theory,
the
third
of
the
1930s.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
haven't
heard
you
said
anything
about
it
but
do
you
draw
a
distinction
between
rowoldt
and
this
case
bearing
on
meaningfulness
that
membership
here
was
1949
to
1953
whatever
the
time
is
whereas
membership
in
rowoldt
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
was
incurred
to
--
are
you
arguing
that
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
you
--
i
gather
--
if
you've
argued
that

justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
don't
believe
you
argued
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
guess
i
didn't
hear
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

that
has
been
done.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
have
the
opening
sentence
at
page
14,
both
sides

upon
