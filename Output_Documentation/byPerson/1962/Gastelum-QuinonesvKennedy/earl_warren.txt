gastelum-quinones
versus
robert
f.
kennedy,
attorney
general.
mr.
rein.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
sells
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
tortillas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
big
was
the
club?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
big
was
the
club?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yet
he
didn't
meet
the
petitioner
at
any
of
those
meetings?
is
that
what
i
understood
you
to
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
terris.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
terris,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
assume
--
let's
discard
for
the
moment
that
the
ex
parte
statement
that
rowoldt
made
at
the
time
he's
arrested
to
the
effect
that
he
joined
the
party
for
bread
and
butter,
or
words
to
that
effect,
let's
exclude
that
from
that
case.
is
there
any
meaningful
difference
between
rowoldt
and
this
case
with
the
exception
of
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
two
years
instead
of
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
rowoldt
didn't
testify,
did
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now
let's
--
let's
get
back
to
my
question
if
we
can.
what
other
meaningful
distinction
is
there
between
this
case
and
rowoldt
other
than
the
fact
that
his
was
for
one
year,
this
was
for
two
years,
and
rowoldt's
was
in
1938
and
this
was
1949,
or
whenever
it
was.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
--
is
there
any
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
a
finding
to
that
effect
that
he
was
an
officer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
--
those
are
the
only
differences
you
know
of.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
so
if
--
this
man
when
he
was
arrested
for
deportation
and
said
well
yes,
i
did
join
the
party
but
i
only
did
it
for
bread
and
butter
and
that
was
not
contested
by
the
government,
would
that
have
put
him
within
the
rowoldt
rule
and
would
he
be
entitled
to
--
now
to
remain
in
the
country?
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
you
think
that's
--
do
you
think
that's
a
meaningful
distinction?
don't
you
think
that
every
communist
will
--
if
that's
the
only
distinction
every
communist
will
say,
“oh
yes,
i
joined
it
but
i
joined
it
for
bread
and
butter
personally
not
for
political
purposes”
and
then
you're
stuck
with
all
of
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
might
be
no
way
the
government
couldn't
--
might
be
no
way
the
government
can
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
could
say
that
a
man
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
10
years
ago
wasn't
hungry
for
some
reason
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
other
and
joined
the
party
that
promised
him
some
food
and
some
better
condition
in
life.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
a
little
strange
that
in
a
proceeding
of
this
kind
where
they
bring
two
witnesses
to
testify
how
many
times
a
man
has
attended
inside
meetings,
that
they
wouldn't
ask
him
one
word
about
whether
the
man
had
talked
to
--
whether
he
discussed
any
problems,
whether
he'd
advocated
anything,
whether
he'd
taken
any
action
at
all?
as
i
read
this
record,
those
two
witnesses
testified
and
nobody
asked
them,
did
he
take
any
part
from
the
meetings?
did
he
say
anything?
did
he
preside
at
the
meeting?
was
he
a
head
of
any
committee?
did
he
do
anything?
and
some
of
these
meetings,
most
of
them
were
as
small
as
six
people.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
still
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
he
did
anything
meaningful
at
any
of
those
meetings.
why
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
a
proceeding
comes
to
us
in
that
manner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
why
shouldn't
that
go
back
from
now
and
be
heard
in
the
light
of
rowoldt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
didn't
allow
reopening.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
were
dues
by
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
think
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
would
have
ignored
the
difference
between
them?
he
wrote
both
opinions,
did
he
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
talking
--
no,
i'm
talking
about
galvan
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
galvan
and
rowoldt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
wrote
both
of
them.
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
terris,
i
understood
you
say
a
few
moments
ago
that
in
the
same
document
that
we're
reading
from
on
page
2,
that
the
board
later
found
that
this
voluntary
membership
was
meaningful
membership,
where
does
that
appear?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
well
that's
a
different
document.
that's
in
a
different
proceeding.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
entirely
a
different
proceeding.
mr.
justice
black
was
asking
you
about
these
findings
in
this
particular
--
your
argument
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
is
there
in
this
document,
that
part
of
it
appears
on
page
2
that
we
can
refer
to
in
determining
whether
the
commission
found
that
this
was
meaningful
as
well
as
voluntary.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
none.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
take
any
further
testimony
or
--
to
determine
or
just
say
that's
what
we
meant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rein.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
was
one
of
these
two
witnesses,
scar
--
or
the
other
fellow
an
fbi
agent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
scarletto,
that's
what
i'm
asking.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
