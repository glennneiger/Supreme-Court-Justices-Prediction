mr.

would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
these
buses
were
owned
by
susquehanna
rather
than
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
your
point
as
i
gather
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
statute
applies
only
to
an
actual
train
that
physically
crosses
from
new
jersey
to
new
york?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
i
get
it(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
the
question
for
our
decision
is
narrow
as
this
then,
what
is
a
train?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
does
it
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
i
correctly
understand
you,
mr.
gural.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
far
as
the
state
is
concerned,
the
state
loses
if
we
conclude
that
this
is
a
train.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
making
any
suggestion
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
just
want
to
find
out
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
what
the
issue
was
that
he
sought.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
--
you
mean
for
example
all
the
lackawanna
trains
now
go
into
hoboken?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
go
on
to
manhattan
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
by
a
subway.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
suggest
that
the
premise
here
would
mean
that
new
jersey
commission
has
ousted
it,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
were
ferries
operating
on
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
biunno,
are
there
any
susquehanna
stops
after
the
transfer
before
you
get
to
new
york?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
your
answer
to
mr.
gural's
suggestion
that
affirmance
here
means
that
even
lackawanna
could
terminate
under
13a
(2)
is
that
when
you
get
into
the
station
in
jersey
city,
you
are
free
to
go
by
subway,
is
that
it?
it's
not
integrated
in
that
sense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
still
a
ferry
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
biunno,
may
i
just
ask
you
a
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
looking
at
this
exhibit,
proposed
discontinued
to
service
at
page
74
of
the
record
and
all
the
way
from
butler
to
north
bergen
there
were
a
whole
lot
of
stations,
oakland,
(inaudible),
wyckoff,
i
never
heard
of
some
of
these.
now,
are
these
the
stations
on
the
susquehanna
service
between
butler
and
north
bergen
before
you
get
to
the
susquehanna
transfer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
74.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
45
and
46?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
question
--
oh,
yes,
i
see
and
my
question
is
this,
i
take
it
the
notice
of
abandonment
is
also
to
abandon
the
intrastate
service
between
and
among
those
several
new
jersey
stops
before
you
get
to
susquehanna
transfer,
isn't
it?
aren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
if
--
i
should've
--
it
must
have
an
answer
to
this
but
to
that
extent
there
is
an
abandonment
of
an
intrastate
service
here,
isn't
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
discontinuance
rather.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
nevertheless
icc
and
not
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
commission
jurisdiction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
hear
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
say
mr.
biunno,
before
--
before
this
new
statute
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
state
commission
would've
been
involved
before
you
could
have
made
this
--
discontinue
this
train
even
though
the
icc
may
have
had
the
last
word,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nothing
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
say
they,
you
mean
the
commission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
this
question
mr.
gural
that
justice
white
and
i
were
putting
to
mr.
biunno
about
that
--
this
apparently
people
ride
to
908
and
leaves
at
butler
at
626
to
hackensack
721
that
was
the
--
they
couldn't
care
less
whether
you
go
on
to
susquehanna
transfer
but
if
they're
going
to
lose
that
service.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
i
haven't
--
you
haven't
made
in
the
argument
based
on
that
or
is
there
no
merits
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
you're
wrong
about
that,
suppose
you
are
wrong
and
this
is
a
train
in
that
sense
even
though
it
utilizes
a
bus,
what
about
the
state's
interest
in
the
continuance
of
that
intrastate
service?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
even
though.
i
understood
mr.
biunno
to
say
that
if
they
go
off
on
this
application
tomorrow,
you
can
require
them
to
put
another
train
on
just
for
the
intrastate
points
up
to
the
transfer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
disagree
with
them
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
just
had
a
gift
times
five.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
entirely
intrastate
that
his
point
was
that
abandonment
or
discontinue
of
this
interstate
train
and
then
tomorrow
you
can
require
them
to
give
another
train
service
between
the
intrastate
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
20
days?
you
have
the
20
days
from
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
threw
it
out
in
the
grounds
of
jurisdiction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
follow
you
on
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
didn't
act
because
they
thought
they
had
no
power
to
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
a
surprise
if
you're
out.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
we
affirm
then
why
don't
the
things
start
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
application
or
the
notice
we'll
give
them
tomorrow.
