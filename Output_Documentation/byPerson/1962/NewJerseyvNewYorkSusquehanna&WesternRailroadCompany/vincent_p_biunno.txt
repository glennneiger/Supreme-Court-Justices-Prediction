mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
whatever
the
eventual
determination
of
this
case
may
be,
it
is
a
symbolic
coincidence
that
it
should've
been
reached
for
argument
today,
december
11,
1962.
the
coincidence
there
that
some
time
today
in
one
of
the
85
assembly
plants
to
united
states,
they
will
be
built
a
200
million
automobile
manufactured
in
the
united
states
since
1896.
it
took
52
years
to
build
the
first
100
million
and
only
14
years
was
needed
to
build
the
second
100
million.
the
coincidence
is
symbolic
because
this
vast
achievement
of
what
has
become
the
nation's
largest
industry
is
an
undeniable
reflection
of
a
tremendous
change
in
the
travel
habits
of
our
public.
and
this
is
itself,
the
massive
force
underlying
the
very
difficult
problems
of
the
nation's
railroads.
part
of
this
problem
is
before
the
court
today
in
the
form
of
this
disagreement
about
procedure
in
which
procedure
should
be
followed
to
discontinue
an
operation
used
to
transport
passengers
between
new
jersey
and
new
york.
now,
before
launching
into
our
own
affirmative
argument,
i
do
want
to
call
attention
to
several
basic
factors
which
will
perhaps
help
answer
incidental
questions
that
might
otherwise
come
up.
the
appellant
has
noted
that
the
facts
relating
to
the
financial
results
of
operation
both
with
respect
to
the
passenger
service
and
the
overall
passenger
and
freight
operations
are
merely
self-serving
declarations
not
tested
at
a
hearing.
the
facts
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
statement
if
the
court
please
are
set
out
in
the
statement
required
to
be
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
a
13a
(1)
proceeding.
and
i
refer
the
court
--
i
refer
the
court
to
section
1.19
of
the
rules
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
49
code
of
federal
regulations
at
page
52
of
appellee's
brief.
it
states
that
recitals
of
materials
and
relevant
facts
in
a
pleading
filed
prior
oral
hearing
in
any
proceeding
unless
specifically
denied
in
the
counterpleading
shall
constitute
evidence
and
shall
be
a
part
of
the
record
without
special
admission
on
corporation.
but
if
request
was
reasonably
made,
a
competent
witness
must
be
made
available
for
cross-examination
on
the
evidence
so
included
in
the
record.
now,
the
appellants
here
have
the
opportunity,
have
they
followed
a
better
practice
to
file
an
answer
on
the
merits
including
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
i'm
sure
that
the
concept
of
waiving
jurisdictional
issues
by
filing
an
answer
is
no
longer
true
in
the
proceedings
before
administrative
agencies
that
is
in
courts
that
used
to
be
years
ago
that
if
you
wanted
to
challenge
the
method
of
service
of
the
summons,
you
had
to
make
a
special
appearance.
and
if
you
so
much
have
asked
from
an
extension
of
time,
you
found
that
you
were
in
court
and
no
longer
have
the
opportunity
to
challenge
service.
in
recent
years,
this
has
all
have
been
changed,
the
traps
of
the
technicalities
have
been
erased
and
the
attitude
is
to
encourage.
in
fact,
required
that
all
matters
of
defense
whether
they
go
to
the
merits
or
whether
they
go
to
jurisdiction
or
method
of
service.
so
all
be
raised
in
the
answer.
this
would
give
an
opportunity
if
there
were
a
dispute
on
the
facts
for
the
state
to
have
said
what
that
dispute
is,
having
chosen
to
limit
their
objection
to
what
they
call
an
issue
of
jurisdiction.
i
submit
they
can
hardly
complain
here
of
the
effect
of
the
rule
of
the
commission
which
makes
those
statements
evidence.
the
other
question
that
i
would
like
to
mention
very
briefly
is
in
relation
with
the
one
asked
by
mr.
justice
harlan
as
to
what
would
happen
with
the
state
court
--
state
agency
record.
the
rules
on
13a
(2)
proceeding
which
we
have
also
printed
at
page
56
of
appellee's
brief,
43.6
subsection
(d)
to
be
filed
only
with
the
original
of
the
petition
to
the
commission,
copy
of
the
record
made
before
the
state
authority
including
copies
of
the
application
or
petition
to
a
transcript
of
any
of
our
hearing
and
decision
and
order,
if
any.
so,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
itself
requires
that
the
record
before
the
agency
be
in
substance
to
starting
point
so
that
all
particular
data
need
not
be
again
repeated
in
the
hearing
before
the
commission.
now,
turning
to
the
substance
of
the
issue
on
this
matter,
we
submit
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
is
undoubtedly
correct
for
the
number
of
independent
reasons
each
of
which
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
section
13a
(1)
applies
here.
the
first
reason
is
that
by
force
of
law,
case
law
and
statute,
this
transfer
operation
between
north
bergen,
new
jersey
and
manhattan,
new
york
is
to
be
regarded
and
handled
in
the
same
way
as
though
the
trains
themselves
went
into
new
york.
i
say
by
force
its
case
law
because
prior
the
enactment
of
the
motor
carrier
law
in
1935,
it
had
already
been
ruled
by
this
court
in
the
central
transfer
case
that
intra-terminal
transfers
by
motor
truck
paying
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
it
was
recognized
there
and
i
mentioned
this
because
the
rationale
is
always
of
more
interest
than
the
specific
result.
the
rationale
was
that
if
you're
going
to
regulate
the
railroad
transportation
effectively
you
must
regulate
all
aspects
of
it
and
where
the
transfer
is
essential
to
the
railroad
operation,
it
would
be
hopelessly
ineffective
to
allow
local
agencies
to
regulate
the
truck
operation
and
have
the
interstate
commerce
commission
regulate
the
trains.
there
will
be
a
division
of
authority
here
that
would
undercut
the
very
purpose
of
the
act
itself.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
you
are
assuming
now,
i
take
it,
a
physical
arrangement
in
which
our
passengers
would
be
free
to
leave
our
facilities
and
walk
out
on
the
street
and
either
go
to
new
york
or
not
go
to
new
york
--
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
we
didn't
say
which
to
--
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
on
a
situation
it
might
be
different.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
it
might
be
different.
this
is
the
situation
obtaining
at
jersey
city
for
example
where
trains
terminate
their
run
and
where
a
passenger
may,
if
he
wishes
to
go
to
new
york,
change
to
h&m
2,
path
as
it's
called
now
or
he
can
do
this
at
newark
but
he
may
not
and
there
is
no
integration
in
the
sense
we
have
here
--
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
--
between
the
two.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
we
have
some
intrastate
passengers,
yes.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
but
not
at
susquehanna
transfer,
your
honor.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
there's
nothing
there
but
to
get
on
the
bus.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
that's
right.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
that's
not
correct.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
i
understand
that.
this
is
not
--
unfortunately
--
explicitly
in
the
record
but
the
arrangement
with
public
service
transportation
company
who
runs
the
buses
is
that
they
are
to
carry
only
rail
passengers
holding
tickets
to
and
from
points
on
the
susquehanna
line
and
that
the
railroads
shall
designate
or
shall
instruct
public
services
to
the
method
of
identification.
and
since
this
problem
was
specifically
pointed
up
in
the
appellants'
vagrant
opposition
to
our
motion
to
affirm,
we
checked
and
found
that
there
have
been
a
small
handful
of
people
who
ride
the
erie-lackawanna
who
have
been
using
the
bus
by
paying
a
quarter.
this
had
been
done
without
our
approval.
it's
unlawful
so
far
as
we're
concerned
and
we
promptly
instructed
public
service
to
accept
nobody,
except
with
a
bus
ticket
and
with
a
susquehanna
ticket.
now,
there
used
to
be
an
arrangement
with
the
erie-lackawanna
whereby,
their
passengers
could
also
use
this
bus
on
a
like
arrangement.
but
that
contract
was
terminated
back
in
1959
and
we
suppose
that
there
are
a
couple
of
passengers
who
have
the
habit
of
riding
it
and
who
still
do
and
for
all
we
know
and
maybe
still
doing
it
in
some
fashion
that
we
get
in
effect.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
not
anymore.
they
used
to
run
to
jersey
city
and
then
take
the
passengers
across
on
the
erie
ferry
but
the
ferry
service
was
terminated
at
the
same
time
that
erie
ferry
was
terminated
and
thereafter
there
was
a
118
proceeding
for
abandonment
of
the
remaining
portion
of
the
erie
truckage
which
had
been
under
lease
down
at
jersey
city.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
no.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
it
doesn't
--
this
case
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
for
this
--
for
several
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
i
do
not
understand
that
the
ferries
run
on
schedules
that
are
tied
in
with
the
trains
in
the
sense
these
buses
are.
they
are
general
ferries
and
i
can
get
on
that
with
an
automobile,
i
think
even
today.
i
haven't
tried
it
but
i'm
pretty
sure
i
can.
i
can
certainly
walk
in
off
the
street
and
ride
without
ever
being
a
real
passenger.
now,
if
those
ferries
will
run
on
the
basis
that
these
buses
were
so
that
lackawanna
will
be
in
a
position
to
say,
“we
are
discontinuing
train
111
consisting
of
the
run
to
jersey
city
and
the
corresponding
ferry
crossing
to
new
york
then
this
principle
might
well
apply
but
then
it
wouldn't
be
because
of
this
case.
13a
(1)
in
the
state's
own
argument
says
train
or
ferry
that's
all
it
would
be
involved.
so,
even
without
the
question
of
whether
you
mean
by
train,
if
this
were
the
form
of
lackawanna's
operation,
they
could
have
13a
(1)
applied
without
regard
to
this
case
at
all.
now,
of
course
after
the
central
transfer
case
rule
at
intra-terminal
incidental
motor
truck
services
were
to
be
regulated
in
the
same
fashion
as
the
trains
were
by
the
icc,
the
same
principle
was
explicitly
enacted
in
1940
as
an
amendment
to
the
motor
carrier
act.
that's
section
12
(2)
(c)
which
we
referred
to
which
it
should
be
noted
not
only
excludes
those
operations
from
part
2
does
not
treat
them
as
motor
carrier
operations
but
affirmatively
commands
that
they
be
regulated
in
the
same
fashion
as
the
transportation
by
rail
to
which
they
are
incidental.
next,
you
say
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
is
correct
by
force
of
res
judicata.
in
the
proceedings
of
which
excerpts
appear
at
the
record
page
46,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
made
determinations
a
fact.
one,
that
susquehanna's
terminal
is
at
new
york.
two,
if
the
transfer
of
point
in
north
bergen
is
within
the
terminal
area
of
that
terminal.
three,
that
the
service
is
an
intra-terminal
transfer.
now,
in
this
respect,
our
factual
and
legal
background
differs
considerably
from
that
in
the
arlington
and
fairfax
case.
and
on
to
the
fairfax,
and
this
is
a
history
which
are
little
difficult
to
piece
together
from
the
three
opinions
starting
with
u.s.
against
elgin.
there
had
been
a
rail
operation
into
the
district
with
a
railroad
station
in
the
district
across
14th
street
bridge.
the
terminal
building
was
taken
by
the
federal
government
for
government
buildings
and
while
the
opinions
are
silent,
there
must
have
been
some
proceeding
to
abandon
that
portion
of
the
line
of
railroad
which
led
from
virginia
and
to
the
district
because
that
service
stops
and
the
new
terminal
was
in
virginia.
then
came
the
use
of
this
convertible
auto
car
and
it's
amazing
to
see
how
far
back
that
goes.
run
on
rails
and
by
lowering
rubber
tired
wheels
could
ride
on
the
city
streets
and
this
is
where
the
litigation
came
up
and
it's
quite
a
bit
of
litigation.
the
first
case
was
as
the
result
of
a
refusal
of
the
district
commission
to
fix
a
route
and
the
carrier
sought
mandamus.
this
was
denied
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
the
ground
that
the
determination
of
what
was
a
terminal
area
and
whether
the
virginia
terminals
was
within
that
terminal
area.
there's
a
question
of
fact
requiring
expert
knowledge
of
transportation
and
should
be
made
a
determination
made
by
the
icc,
the
court
would
not
make
it.
they
went
back
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
they
applied
for
a
certificate
under
118
to
extend
their
line
of
railroads.
and
this
is
what
it
implies
if
they
must
have
applied
for
a
certificate
to
abandon
the
corresponding
portion.
strangely
enough,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
while
holding
that
this
would
not
be
an
extension
of
a
line
of
railroad
distinguishing
the
new
york
dock
case,
expressly
said
that
it
did
not
decide
whether
it
was
within
the
terminal
area.
if
they
had
made
that
determination
and
if
they
had
been
that
it
wasn't
within
the
terminal
area,
it
would
have
been
no
further
disputing
the
question
about
whether
a
certificate
was
needed
and
what
kind
of
certificate
but
they
passed
the
question
and
didn't
decide
it.
the
carrier
went
back
to
the
district
commission,
did
get
a
route
designation
but
the
district
commission
refused
to
say
whether
or
not
an
icc
certificate
was
needed
so
they
began
operations.
a
competitor
took
that
into
courts
on
a
proceeding
for
injunction,
succeeded
in
getting
the
injunction,
the
appeals
was
taken,
it
was
argued,
the
court
was
ready
to
file
its
opinion
when
the
carrier
reported
that
its
financial
condition
obliged
to
drop
the
project
entirely
and
will
never
find
out
what
the
appellate
court
had
decided
to
do
with
it.
so,
i
say
we
learned
very
little
so
far
as
the
law
is
concerned
from
that
one.
but
--
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
yes.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
this
is
74?
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
this
is
a
notice
of
discontinuance.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
they
--
or
between
butler
and
susquehanna
transfer
the
actual
station
stops.
i
suggest
you
will
find
what's
easier
to
look
at.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
on
page
45,
46
which
is
a
timetable.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
45,
46
is
an
exhibit.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
this
proceeding
will
be
to
discontinue
the
entire
operation
which
would
include
both.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
discontinuance?
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
yes,
sure.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
oh
yes.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
no
question
about
that
and
there's
no
question
about
this
either.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
well,
the
fact
that
the
matter
comes
under
13a
(1)
doesn't
mean
you
better
get
the
relief
what
you
ask
for
if
the
local
service
--
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
well
--
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
in
new
york?
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
that's
a
different
question,
if
your
honor
please,
we've
pointed
out
on
page
38
of
our
brief
that
we
do
not
contend
that
by
virtue
of
the
application
of
13a
(1),
the
state
of
new
jersey
has
no
jurisdiction
whatever
over
intrastate
commerce.
we
recognize
fully
that
if
the
state
that
you
see,
feels
that
there
should
be
a
train
operator
between
let's
say
butler
and
paterson
both
within
the
state
of
new
jersey
for
intrastate
service,
they
have
the
full
power
to
require
us
to
do
it.
but
that's
a
different
train,
the
train
we
are
running
now.
do
you
follow
me
on
that?
in
other
words,
we
--
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
--
we
proposed
the
discontinuance
of
train
108,
butler
to
new

proceedings

under

is
discontinuance.
this
is
no
bar,
the
state
of
new
jersey
saying,
“intrastate
requirements
have
a
need
for
a
train
between
butler
and
paterson
you
run
it
and
if
they
can
show
a

for
it,
we
have
to

mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
and
that
--
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
right.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
that's
right.
the
accesso.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
only
--
are
you
speaking
only
of
a
train
that
carries
only
intrastate?
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
well,
i
think
that's
a
question
that
was
answered
a
good
many
years
ago
when
118
was
first
construed.
it's
the
same
problem.
a
complete
abandonment
--
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
i
know.
that
came
up
--
that
kind
of
problem
was
considered
in
colorado
against
u.s.,
which
i
think
is
probably
the
most
instructive
opinion
that
i've
come
across
in
the
research
for
this
argument
which
relates
to
118.
i
think
it's
been
a
--
as
a
result
of
a
misconception
of
the
law
on
118
that
led
to
the
enactment
of
13
(a)
in
the
first
place.
i
don't
think
they
needed
it
but
this
court
pointed
out
in
colorado
against
united
states,
every
projected
abandonment
of
any
part
of
a
railroad
engaged
in
both
interstate
and
intrastate
commerce
may
conceivably
involve
a
conflict
between
state
and
national
interests.
now,
you're
not
--
the
congress
nonetheless
exercised
as
to
118
its
interstate
commerce
power
and
place
that
power
solely
and
exclusively
in
the
commission.
the
point
the
court
makes
in
colorado
against
united
states
is
that
while
the
commission
has
exclusive
authority,
this
does
not
mean
that
local
institute
disregard
it.
this
is
now
a
subject
to
be
taken
up
in
the
course
of
considering
whether
the
application
should
be
granted
or
not.
and
in
that
regard,
colorado
against
u.s.
strongly
urges
that
the
local
interest
be
accommodated
as
fully
as
possible
consistent
with
the
intrastate
interest.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
yes.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
the
understanding
before
the
statute
was
that
the
icc
had
nothing
to
say
about
it.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
this,
i
think,
was
wrong
and
that
came
up
the
only
time
that
was
decided,
if
your
honor
please,
was
in
first
ferry
cases.
it
was
raised
over
in
the
first
ferry
cases.
those
cases
were
taken
here
but
the
appeal
was
dismissed
because
it
became
moot
to
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
i
think
the
first
ferry
cases
are
wrong.
now,
one
reason
for
that
is
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
about
the
buses.
if
we
got
these
trains
off
under
13a
(2),
how
would
we
get
the
buses
off?
it
has
been
suggested
that
we
do
that
merely
by
filing
a
change
of
tariff.
well,
if
it
that's
so,
why
do
they
have
all
the
trouble
that
they
didn't
get
in
the
ferries
off?
why
didn't
they
just
file
a
change
of
tariffs?
well,
we
know
very
well
it
couldn't
do
any
such
thing.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
because
what?
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
and
so
are
we.
our
line
is
to
new
york
city.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
our
line
is
to
new
york
city,
you
see
--
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
the
bus
line
is.
here's
what
the
first
ferry
case
has
held.
now,
this
is
interesting
because
it's
the
rule
of
the
whole
trouble
here.
susquehanna
has
a
line
to
new
york
city.
at
the
time
that
this
bus
service
was
inaugurated,
that
service
was
executed
by
trains
to
jersey
city
and
ferries
across
the
river
just
like
the
erie,
just
like
the
new
york
central
and
just
like
all
the
others.
when
this
bus
service
began,
we
still
serve
new
york
by
the
ferries.
susquehanna
transfer
bus
operation
was
an
ultimate
group
and
we
went
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
someone
had
raised
the
question,
“don't
you
need
a
certificate
to
run
the
bus?”
an
application
was
made
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
said,
“no,
you
don't.”
your
terminal
is
new
york.
when
you
reach
north
bergen
you
are
within
your
terminal
area.
the
bus
operation
is
intra-terminal
transfer.
it
is
not
“an
extension”
of
a
line
of
railroad
not
for
the
reason
in
arlington
fairfax
but
for
the
reason
that
our
line
of
railroad
already
ran
to
new
york
and
this
was
simply
an
ultimate
branch.
now,
if
you
read
the
opinion
in
the
first
ferry
cases,
you
will
find
that
the
source
of
the
whole
difficulty
declared
to
the
enactment
of
13
(a)
was
that
118
in
the
abandonment
section
had
been
read
to
that
time
and
the
general
understanding
was
that
abandonment
necessarily
involved
a
complete
termination
of
service
on
some
serial
segment
of
a
railroad
and
not
a
parallel
segment,
if
i
can
make
that
distinction.
in
other
words,
i
might
have
several
ways
of
going
to
point
a
or
point
b.
if
i
am
to
come
under
118,
the
understanding
was
that
everything
between
point
a
and
b
had
to
be
terminated.
i
think
this
was
a
misreading
of
the
act.
it
says
abandonment
in
whole
or
in
part
and
there
is
nothing
i
know
of
that
says
that
a
part
has
to
be
between
point
a
and
b
and
not
one
of
the
routes
but
anyway
that's
what
they
held.
now,
in
the
first
ferry
cases
--
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
the
commission
i
believe
has
a
long
line
of
rulings
to
that
effect
on
what
we
call
curtailment
or
discontinuance
or
possible
discontinuance
of
service.
now,
in
the
ferry
cases,
this
came
up
because
the
railroads
pointed
out
that
they
ran
a
passenger
ferry
from
let
us
say
we
walk
in
to
33rd
street
and
this
was
a
different
route
than
the
route
used
to
carry
freight
across
the
hudson
river
that
the
--
the
ferry
service
while
starting
at
one
point
either
we
walk
at
the
jersey
city
fan
out
like
the
fingers
of
a
hand
to
multiple
points
of
the
new
york
side
which
were
different
points
for
a
degree
than
the
freight
routes
were.
this
would
have
been
an
abandonment
of
a
part
of
the
line
of
railroad
taking
part
to
meet
a
parallel
alternate
route.
the
first
ferry
cases
said,
“no.”
in
line
of
railroad
is
a
single
entity.
it
is
the
whole
cord
and
no
single
strand
of
that
cord
may
be
separated
from
it
and
its
service
terminated
unless
you
abandon
operation
on
the
cord
as
a
whole
and
of
that,
i
think,
is
the
route
--
i'm
sorry,
difficulty
as
to
route
of
the
enactment
of
13
(a)
i
think
is
wrong.
there's
no
occasion
decided
here,
i
can
see,
but
it
is
a
value
in
understanding
the
context
in
which
13
(a)
was
passed.
now,
of
course
as
to
the
idea
that
a
train
is
a
train
as
the
appellant
say,
this
must
be
said,
“a
train
has
any
number
of
varied
meanings.”
one
meaning
could
be
as
suggested
by
the
appellant
of
this
court
had
held
in
the
erie
railroad
against
united
states,
a
locomotive
of
cars
coupled
together
from
running
along
the
track.
of
course,
that
case
didn't
hold
if
that's
what
a
train
means.
it
held
that
such
an
operation
was
a
line
haul
and
not
a
switching
operation,
entirely
different
question.
but
any
event,
it
could
mean
a
specific
locomotive
and
a
specific
car
or
set
of
cars
or
it
can
mean
the
particular
run
at
a
certain
time
of
the
day
between
two
different
points
regardless
of
whether
it's
the
same
locomotive
or
different
locomotive,
that
sort
of
thing
that
in
railroad
pods
is
called,
train
99.
that
train
99
here,
if
you
look
at
the
timetable,
is
the
whole
service
from
butler
to
new
york
and
back
again,
part
of
which
is
executed
by
motor
coach,
a
part
of
which
is
executed
by
anyone
of
a
number
of
different
locomotives,
and
number
of
different
cars,
not
the
same
locomotive
and
not
the
same
car
day
in,
day
out.
now,
of
course,
it
doesn't
even
mean
--
it
can't
mean
the
vehicle
that
runs
on
steel
wheels
on
tracks.
the
interstate
commerce
itself
--
interstate
commerce
act
itself
today,
made
this
1962
in
section
19
(a),
still
uses
the
term
“steam
railroad.”
we
all
know
very
well
that
the
(inaudible)
electric
motor
power
but
we
wouldn't
hesitate
to
say
the
railroad
that
used
to
use
steam
is
the
one
that's
covered
by
the
section
even
though
it
no
longer
uses
steam.
there
was
a
proposal
perhaps
six
or
seven
years
ago
for
this
very
north
jersey
and
new
york
area
to
build
a
loop
service
to
which
the
key
idea
was
that
the
vehicles
would
run
on
rubber
tires
in
a
concrete
channel.
they
would
be
automatic
like
that
kind
of
horizontal
elevator.
i'm
sure
that
would
be
a
train
for
the
purpose
of
13a
(1)
but
it
wouldn't
look
like
the
train
in
the
old
sense.
the
engineers
are
suppose
to
be
working
on
things
like
levicar
that
ride
on
a
cushion
of
air,
no
wheels
at
all,
would
this
be
a
train
for
the
purpose
of
this
section?
i'm
sure
it
would.
so,
i
don't
think
it
makes
much
difference
that
a
bus
in
one
sense
is
not
the
same
thing
as
a
train
in
that
sense.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
i'm
sorry.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
my
understanding,
if
your
honor
please,
is
that
the
method
of
execution
is
up
to
the
railroad.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
--
i
would
say
not.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
yes.
of
course
the
view
of
safety
would
have
a
good
deal
to
say
about
mechanical
changes
of
this
kind.the
interstate
commerce
commission
would
be
intimately
involved
in
any
such
drastic
change
from
a
safety
standpoint
but
not
from
a
certificate
standpoint.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
yes.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
correct.
mr.
vincent
p.
biunno
yes.
now,
of
course
the
other
reason
why
the
result
involved
was
right
is
that
the
overwhelming
ratio
of
passengers
are
intrastate,
90%
or
so.
and
how
this
can
be
an
operation
which
the
states
must
first
pass
it
on,
i
do
not
understand.
in
any
event,
the
trial
court
even
if
you
would
read
the
statute
as
the
appellant
suggests,
the
court
could
not
have
refused
to
enjoin
and
set
aside
the
order.
first,
because
the
icc
dismissed
instead
of
exercising
its
undoubted
jurisdiction
under
13a
(2)
within
appropriate
amendment
applying
the
same
principles
that
were
stated
only
a
week
ago
in
forman
in
this
court
that
the
federal
rule
of
pleading
are
designed
to
reach
the
merits
and
that's
precisely
what
we
feel
should
have
been
done
here
even
if
the
statute
is
read
and
as
the
state
contends.
and
second,
because
the
icc
dismissed
on
the
state's
motion
not
only
without
a
hearing
but
without
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing,
they
dismissed
it
before
the
time
for
reapply
under
their
own
rules
that
had
expired.
and
this,
at
least
was
a
denial
of
due
process.
now,
the
state
insists
that
13a
(2)
applies
and
that
it
should
have
the
first
opportunity
to
conduct
the
hearing.
the
difficulty
with
this
argument
is
that
it
has
admitted
to
this
court
in
the
course
of
the
papers
filed
that
this
case
was
right
for
13a
(2)
proceeding
at
the
time
this
statement
was
filed.
secondly,
it
is
not
required
by
state
law
and
this
is
rs-48224
which
we
cite
on
page
16
of
our
brief
that
the
state
commission
be
on
the
application
of
the
carrier,
the
state
agency
has
a
general
supervisory
power
just
as
the
federal
commission
has
and
it
is
kept
thoroughly
aware
of
conditions
through
required
filing,
it
may
itself
initiate
and
hold
a
hearing
on
this
question
any
time
it
chose
to
do
so.
and
two
years
have
gone
by
without
any
such
step
having
been
taken.
it
can't
complain
if
it
hasn't
had
its
own
hearing
before
its
own
body
if
it's
entitled
to
it.
thank
you.
