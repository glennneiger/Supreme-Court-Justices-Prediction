yes,

you
just
don't

you
just
think
that
a
bus
ride
in
connection
with
an
intrastate
train,
the
continuation
of
an
intrastate
train

bus
arranged

for
a
service
--
justice
byron

white
you
don't
think
then
that
the
word
“service”
includes
a
depot?
that
isn't
the
service
of
the
train
--
justice

--
that's
the
service
for
the
railroad
company.
justice

to
all
intrastate

are
what?
under

what

the

does

buy

no

would

passengers
ride
on

or
from
other

justice
byron

so
what
are
other
railroads
--
other
railroads
that
use
bus?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
the
same
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
here
in
the
sense
that
everybody
who
--
everybody
who
gets
on
this
train
doesn't
go
on
to
new
york
that
was
the
thing,
that
if
it's
so,
was
it?
justice

yes,
we
will
get
off
the
train
and
don't
take
the
bus.
justice

there's
nothing
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
--
but
the
other
part
of
it
applies
if
perhaps
if
he
can
get
off
the
train
if
he
wants
to
and
leave
and
also
he
doesn't
buy
through
ticket
all
the
time?
justice
byron

he
may
--
he
may
buy
just
the
train
ticket
on
the
train
and
pay
--
and
then
get
on
the
bus
and
pay
an
additional
sum
for
his
bus
ride.
justice
byron
r.
white
after
that
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
is
that?
the
argument
that
the
state
is
making
here,
why
it's
even
more
forcefully
to
the
abandonment
of
a
service
between
north
bergen
and
some
point
between
north
bergen
and
susquehanna
transfer?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
say
that
the
argument
in
its
faith
would
apply
more
forcefully
that
this
comes
under
--
the
best
part
of
it
anyway
comes
under
13a
(2)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it's
the
only
part
that
if
you
come
under
13a
(1)
is
between
susquehanna
transfer
or
the
last
stop
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
new
york.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
you
are
saying
don't
you
--
aren't
you
that
13a
(1)
permits
you
to
abandon
the
full
train,
the
north
bergen
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
without
filing
anything
with
the
state
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
the
accesso
that
only
applies
to
an
interstate
train.
i'm
talking
about
an
intrastate
train
that
goes
to
north
bergen
at
some
point
to
susquehanna
transfer
and
you're
saying
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
suppose
the
train
is
still
a
train
between
two
intrastate
points
even
though
it
goes
beyond
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
train
number
so
and
so
is
--
you
will
see
on
the
sign,
this
is
a
train
that
runs
from
north
bergen
to
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
were
certificated.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
were
certificated.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
the
bus
line
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
bus
line
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
whether
--
but
the
question
here
is
what
is
--
what
are
the
respective
scopes
of
13a
(1)
and
13a
(2)?
justice
byron
r.
white
congress
says
that
the
states
may
pass
--
may
first
pass
on
the
discontinuance
of
an
intrastate
train.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it
an
intrastate
train
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
after
the
hackensack?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
just
argued
that
it
is
not
an
interstate
claim,
it
hooks
onto
bus.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
don't
know
why
you
won't
argue
that
an
intrastate
train
no
matter
what
it
has
ought
to
do
because
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
it
runs
to
hackensack.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
aren't
you
saying
that
why
abandon
and
have
it
that
--
then
you
have
to
set
up
a
new
docket
and
have
a
new
hearing
to
go
on
the
train
and
you
said
abandon
meanwhile
and
then
you
have
to
get
them
to
reinstitute
a
service,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
like
to
get
(voice

before
they
abandon
that
train
from
the
hackensack?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
would
you
--
how
would
the
railroad
has
gone
about
terminating
only
the
bus
service?
let's
assume
that
it
dis
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
they
didn't
want
to
go
into
new
york
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
it
wanted
to
stop
at
the
last
stop
before
susquehanna
transfer?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
interstate
aspect
of
this
train
could
have
been
terminated
by
a
change
in
tariff?
