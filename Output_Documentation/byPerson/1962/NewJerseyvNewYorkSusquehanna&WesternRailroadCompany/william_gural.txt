mr.
william
gural
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
a
three-judge
statutory
court,
which
reversed
a
determination
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
that
determination
would
be
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
to
permit
a
discontinuance
of
the
trains
which
were
operated
by
this
railroad
has
one
judge
dissenting.
this
railroad
operates
three
trains
in
each
direction
between
butler,
new
jersey
and
susquehanna
transfer
in
north
bergen,
new
jersey.
thereafter,
passengers
are
transported
by
a
bus
to
the
port
of
new
york
authority
bus
terminal.
this
carrier
sought
to
discontinue
its
trains
under
the
provisions
of
section
13a
(1)
of
the
1958
transportation
act
which
is
concerned
with
interstate
trains.
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
its
determination
says
--
said
that
these
were
intrastate
trains
and
the
fact
that
they're
connected
with
a
bus
carrying
them
on
to
new
york,
did
not
make
it
an
interstate
train,
so
that
the
provisions
of
13a
(1)
did
not
apply.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
transportation
act
of
1958,
the
jurisdiction
over
the
discontinuance
of
trains
and
ferries,
both
interstate
and
intrastate
was
--
were
in
the
states.
the
federal
or
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
no
jurisdiction
over
the
discontinuance
of
a
train
or
ferry.
its
jurisdiction
was
over
the
discontinuance
or
the
abandonment
of
a
line
of
railroad.
now,
13
--
section
13a
is
divided
into
two
parts,
there's
a
subsection
13a
(1)
which
deals
with
a
discontinuance
of
interstate
trains
and
a
procedure
is
outlined
in
this
section
where
in
the
carrier
post
its
notices
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
may
or
may
not
act
to
require
those
trains
to
continue.
and
on
the
other
hand,
subsection
13a
(2)
deals
with
intrastate
trains
and
there,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
may
not
act
unless
and
until
the
state
first
has
had
an
opportunity
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction
over
those
intrastate
trains.
the
procedure
under
13a
(2)
is
different
too
because
if
a
state
fails
to
act
within
a
period
of
a
120
days
or
denies
the
relief
that
the
carrier
request
with
respect
to
discontinuance,
the
intrastate
commerce
commission
must
hold
a
full
hearing.
i
must
make
specific
findings
with
respect
to
the
--
or
the
effect
that
present
and
future
can
--
public
convenience
and
necessity,
permit
the
discontinuance
of
the
service
and
also
that
the
continued
operation
of
these
intrastate
trains
would
be
a
burden
on
the
carriers'
interstate
operations
or
on
interstate
commerce
itself.
now,
i
believe
that
the
statute
itself
is
quite
clear.
it
limits
its
terms
to
the
vehicles
of
transportation,
trains
or
ferries,
buses
are
not
mentioned,
terminals
are
not
mentioned
and
terminal
transfers
are
not
mentioned.
and
even
though
the
bus
here
is
a
vehicle
which
is
incidental
to
railroad
transportation,
the
word
“railroad”
and
the
word
“transportation”
are
larger
terms
than
the
words
“trains
or
ferries”.
the
bus
is
not
incidental
to
a
train
or
to
a
ferry;
it's
incidental
to
railroad
transportation.
now,
i
think
the
court
below
permitted
its
attention
to
be
diverted
to
where
the
passengers
were
going,
where
the
tickets
--
the
destination
on
the
tickets
and
from
that
reason
a
--
an
interstate
train
and
i
submit
that
that
was
incorrect.
it
misapplied
the
word
“transportation”.
transportation
again
is
a
larger
term
than
the
word
“train”.
the
test
in
this
case,
should've
been
“where
do
the
trains
go?”
do
they
travel
from
a
point
in
one
state
to
a
point
in
the
same
state
or
do
those
trains
go
from
a
point
in
one
state
to
a
point
in
another
state?
not
where
the
passengers
going,
not
where
the
bus
goes
or
not
where
the
entertainment
--
enter
--
terminal
transport
takes
them.
the
--
mr.
william
gural
as
far
as
i
know,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
authority
over
the
bus,
their
intrastate
bus,
by
a
provision
in
the
carrier's
tariff.
there's
a
provision
that
these
buses
will
be
carried
across
to
the
port
of
new
york
authority
terminal.
mr.
william
gural
the
interstate
commerce
commission
could
approve
abandonment
of
the
buses
if
this
carrier
should
file
amendment
to
its
tariff
and
discontinue.
in
other
words,
omit
the
provision
for
the
buses
and
if
there
was
no
objection,
i
presumably,
the
bus
could
be
discontinued,
but
i
dare
say
in
this
situation,
there
probably
would
be
objections
because
the
new
york
passengers
would
have
no
way
of
getting
over
and
they
would
probably
ask
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
conduct
an
investigation
and
request
a
hearing
on
the
subject
of
amendments
to
the
tariff
that
would
curtail
this
bus
services.
mr.
william
gural
oh,
if
the
train
was
authorized
to
be
discontinued,
all
the
carrier
would
have
to
do
is
amend
this
tariff
and
i'm
sure
nobody
would
complain
then
once
the
train
was
discontinued.
mr.
william
gural
well,
no
i
disagree
because
this
carrier
operates
these
buses
by
virtue
of
a
provision
that
has
this
tariff,
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
and
if
this
carrier
wanted
to
discontinue
these
buses,
it
could
file
and
amend
the
tariff
and
if
there
were
no
objections
to
the
amendment,
i
would
assume
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
would
permit
the
filing
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
bus.
mr.
william
gural
it
is
an
interstate
bus,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
gural
under
part
2?
i'm
not
familiar,
your
honor.
this
is
a
part
2,
you
mean
a
motor
carrier
operating
under
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity.
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
prepared
on
that
but
this,
i
concede,
is
not
a
part
2
operation.
i
concede
that
it's
a
railroad
operation
under
30
--
under
the
exceptions
in
section
49
u.s.
code
302.
mr.
william
gural
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
gural
it's
--
it
would
be
immaterial
of
the
ownership
because
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
test.
we
are
looking
at
the
vehicle
that
the
statute
spells
out
--
mr.
william
gural
--
trains
or
ferries.
mr.
william
gural
yes
sir,
your
honor.
or
ferry
that
crosses
--
mr.
william
gural
yes
and
because
it
uses
those
two
vehicles,
train
or
ferry
and
excluded
all
other
vehicles,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
spell
--
mr.
william
gural
the
words?
yes,
service
of
--
mr.
william
gural
yes,
and
then
i
pose
the
question
to
myself,
service
of
what?
service
of
a
train
or
a
ferry
and
not
service
of
a
bus.
mr.
william
gural
yes.
this
--
yes,
the
bus
is
a
--
is
an
incidental
service
to
the
railroad
facility.
mr.
william
gural
the
other
--
mr.
william
gural
as
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity.
then
the
problem
would
--
i
see
no
difference
in
the
problem
because
it
would
be
a
--
instead
of
a
bus
meeting
this
train,
it
would
on
a
catch-as-catch-can
basis.
the
certificate
bus
would
operate
its
own
schedule
which
may
not
necessarily
--
mr.
william
gural
no,
sir.
this
--
again,
this
is
not
a
part
2
certificated
operation.
this
operation
was
held
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
be
incidental
--
mr.
william
gural
no,
no.
mr.
william
gural
incidental
to
the
rail
transportation
but
i
submit
when
they
said
incidental
to
rail
transportation,
they
did
not
mean
incidental
to
a
train.rail
operation
or
rail
services
are
much
broader
term
than
the
term
train.
mr.
william
gural
yes
sir.
i
would
say
that
the
--
mr.
william
gural
well,
i
would
qualify
that
service
of
a
train
because
as
soon
as
you
start
using
--
stressing
this
word
“service”,
you
fall
into
a
pitfall.
service
becomes
a
subject
and
‘train
becomes
a
modifier.
in
other
words,
you're
saying
train
service
rather
than
the
service
of
a
train
or
a
ferry.
mr.
william
gural
no.
mr.
william
gural
that's
right.
a
service
in
the
railroad
again
is
larger
but
--
mr.
william
gural
13
(a)
intrastate
or
under
13a
(2).
intrastate
depot,
stations
--
the
discontinuance
of
a
station
would
be,
although
a
station
of
course
is
not
in
the
act
and
i
respectfully
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
brief
of
amicus
national
association
of
railroad
and
utilities
commissioners
at
page
11
where
he
spells
out
the
act
as
it
was
first
introduced
over
the
top
of
the
page.
mr.
william
gural
page
11
of
the
amicus
national
association
of
railroad
and
utilities
commissioners.
he
talks
and
this
is
senate
bill
3778
as
introduced
by
sponsors.
the
discontinuance
are
changed
in
whole
or
in
part
of
the
operation
or
service
of
any
train
or
ferry
engaged
in
the
transportation
of
passengers
or
property
in
interstate
foreign
and
intrastate
commerce
or
any
of
them
or
the
operation
or
service
of
any
station,
depot
or
other
facility
where
passengers
or
property
are
received
for
transportation
in
interstate
foreign
and
intrastate
commerce
or
any
of
them.
now,
note
how
broad
this
statute
was
when
it
was
introduced.
and
reading
it
today,
you
see
that
they
withdrawn
all
of
that
borderline
which
--
and
only
intended
to
have
these
provisions
applied
to
a
train
or
a
ferry,
a
service
of
a
train
or
a
ferry.
mr.
william
gural
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
gural
oh,
yes,
if
you
affirm
the
decision
below,
we
are
--
and
i
might
say
that
we
are
in
out
--
effectively
ousted
from
the
jurisdiction
in
other
carriers
because
the
court
below
i
feel
has
effectively
--
mr.
william
gural
no.
mr.
william
gural
yes.
mr.
william
gural
yes,
sir.
i
feel
that
the
court
below
has
effectively
repealed
13a
(2)
so
far
as
new
jersey
is
concerned
because
all
of
the
trains
in
new
jersey
as
you
know
terminated
a
river.
and
then
there
are
other
vehicles
for
crossing
the
river.
it
could
be
a
taxi,
it
could
be
a
subway,
it
could
be
a
tube.
mr.
william
gural
no,
sir.
the
definition
--
a
line
of
railroad
does
not
necessarily
have
to
apply
to
train.
but
again,
a
line
of
railroad
is
something
greater
than
a
train.
mr.
william
gural
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
gural
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
gural
i
think
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
so
held
that
there
was
a
case
cited
in
my
brief.
the
arlington
--
arlington
and
fnar
company
page
18
of
my
brief,
down
about
the
middle
of
the
page.
the
icc
in
arlington
and
fnar
company
stated
that
an
auto
rail
cars
operating
within
one
state
as
rail
cars
but
converting
it
to
auto
cars
and
then
crossing
the
state
line
into
another
state.
we're
not
an
extension
of
a
line
of
railroad.
and
i
might
say
that
case
that
this
appellee
relies
upon.
the
motor
carrier,
new
york
susquehanna
motor
carrier
application
also
so
held.
i
can
refer
you
to
the
record
at
page
77,
down
one,
two,
three,
four,
five
lines
from
the
bottom
where
the
commission
says,
we
conclude
for
the
reason
there
stated
--
stated
in
this
case
that
i
just
quoted
from
that
applicants
subscribe
more
operation
is
not
an
extension
of
railroad
as
contemplated
by
section
118.
mr.
william
gural
the
same
section
that
applied
to
this
carrier
now.
the
--
i
would
assume
that
this
kind
of
vehicle
would
probably
have
a
tariff
provision
to
continue
the
service
across
the
same
as
this
--
the
carrier
does
have
a
tariff
provision
allowing
the
bus
service
or
providing
for
the
bus
service
from
new
jersey
to
new
york.
mr.
william
gural
yes,
sir.
the
train
as
described
by
this
court
in
--
at
page
18
of
my
brief,
united
states
versus
erie,
237
u.s.
402.
this
court
stated
that
a
train
consist
of
an
engine
of
cars
which
have
been
assembled
and
coupled
together
ran
a
--
ran
or
for
a
trip
along
the
road.
from
the
legislative
history
too,
it
will
be
found
that
a
bus
was
never
mentioned.
there
was
a
discussion
of
the
terminals.
there
was
discussion
of
transfers,
depots,
and
--
but
none
of
these
specific
items
appear
in
the
statute
here,
the
only
vehicles
that
we
have
here
to
deal
with
are
the
train
or
ferry.
now,
the
appellee
--
mr.
william
gural
yes,
sir.
the
train
--
the
passenger
obtains
a
ticket
to
new
york
and
in
that
ticket
it
concludes
a
ride
to
--
from
a
point
in
new
jersey
to
the
port
authority
terminal
and
it
shows
that
--
mr.
william
gural
yes,
on
a
bus
or
on
the
other
hand,
he
can
buy
his
ticket
on
the
train
and
then
pay
a
quarter
to
the
bus
driver
and
continue
his
journey
to
new
york
and
he
has
that
choice.
mr.
william
gural
railroad
passengers
only.
i
did
raise
--
mr.
william
gural
yes,
sir.
i
did
raise
that
in
my
motion
in
our
position
to
affirm
wherein
we
found
that
this
bus
service
was
also
available
to
erie-lackawanna
railroad
train
passenger
using
the
eastbound
morning
train
number
1202
and
the
westbound
evening,
number
train
1203
from
hoboken
to
nyack,
new
york.
mr.
william
gural
yes
sir
but
i
understand
now
as
a
controversy,
these
railroads
since
this
has
been
called
to
their
attention
have
been
prohibiting
the
lackawanna
passengers
from
using
this
bus.
mr.
william
gural
august
of
1958,
your
honor.
mr.
william
gural
yes,
sir.
now,
that
brings
me
to
point
one
of
the
appellee's
arguments
where
he
makes
a
distinction
between
procedure
and
jurisdiction
saying
that
this
is
a
simple
matter
of
procedure.
and,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
way
you
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
any
agency
of
court
is
through
proper
procedure
and
i
can
only
--
in
his
argument
of
course,
he
supposes
that
if
he
came
to
the
public
utility
commission,
he
would
be
denied
the
relief,
but
i
think
that
from
the
period
1956
down
to
july
of
1960
when
this
carrier
has
been
coming
to
the
port
although,
i
must
admit,
there
was
some
very
testy
litigation
in
the
interim
but
they
--
we've
--
the
board
has
permitted
them
to
cut
down
--
cut
back
almost
90%
or
approximately
90%
of
their
train
service.
so
it's
not
as
though
the
board
has
--
is
going
to
deny
them
really.
i
can
only
speculate
that
the
reason
he
--
the
appellee
chose
13a
(1)
because
the
procedure
there
is
a
--
is
shortcutted,
it's
a
chance
that
there
might
not
even
be
a
hearing.
whereas,
under
13a
(2),
a
full
hearing
is
guaranteed.
the
findings
are
somewhat
different
in
--
under
13a
(2).
after
the
state
denies
relief,
the
petitioner
has
a
burden
because
he
must
file
a
petition
with
interstate
commerce
commission
and
then
must
show
that
or
the
commission
must
find
that
the
present
and
future
public
convenience
and
necessity
permit
discontinuance.
that
word
“future”
does
not
appear
on
--
in
13a
(1).
mr.
william
gural
well,
under
13a
(2),
the
interstate
commerce
commission
holds
a
hearing
de
novo
--
mr.
william
gural
however,
the
record
made
in
the
case
below
is
usually
considered
by
the
commission
at
least
we've
always
--
when
we
participate
in
those
hearings,
we've
always
offered
the
complete
record
made
below
in
evidencing
the
commission.
mr.
william
gural
oh
no,
no
--
mr.
william
gural
yes,
i
think
that's
about
the
size
sir.
they
make
independent
findings
and
are
not
bound
by
what
the
state
commission
has
said
in
the
decision.
now,
in
point
two,
the
appellee
makes
a
--
or
points
to
the
intra-terminal
transfer
of
--
that
this
bus
amounts
to
an
aid
to
its
rail
service.
now,
i
submit
that
the
rail
service
is
not
a
train.
in
common
--
in
a
common
carrier
application
that
the
appellee
relies
upon
here,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
made
a
finding
that
this
bus
and
i'm
reading
from
page
50
of
the
appellee's
brief
where
section
49
u.s.
code
302
is
set
forth.
this
bus
was
transportation
by
motor
vehicle
by
any
person
for
a
common
carrier
by
railroad
subject
to
part
1
etcetera
and
i'm
skipping
now
to
page
51.
and
then
the
last
four
lines
there,
as
part
of
and
shall
be
regulated
in
the
same
manner
as
transportation
by
railroad,
express,
motor
vehicle
or
water
or
to
be
freight
forwarder,
transportation
or
service
to
which
such
services
are
incidental.
now,
you
see
these
are
incidental
to
railroad,
incidental
to
express
not
incidental
to
a
train.
now,
in
the
certain
point,
the
appellee
makes
a
great
stress
on
the
word
“service”
and
expresses
some
apprehension
that
if
the
trains
were
discontinued,
he
would
be
forced
to
continue
a
bus
and
i
submit
that
this
is
not
the
case.
i
think
that
if
these
trains
were
allowed
to
be
discontinued,
there
would
be
simple
filing
of
an
amendment
to
its
tariffs
and
if
the
trains
were
off
there,
nobody
in
the
world
would
try
to
continue
a
bus
service
from
susquehanna
transferred
to
new
york
because
there
would
be
no
one
to
use
it.
and
the
icc
would
accept
that
tariff
and
entered
the
filling
and
that
would
finish
the
bus
service.
there'd
be
no
need
to
continue
it.
i
believe
also
that
the
court
below
considered
matters
beyond
the
jurisdictional
question
and
perhaps
permitted
its
sympathy
to
be
carried
away
but
i
submit
that
all
of
the
material
on
the
financial
condition
of
this
carrier,
the
loss
of
passengers
and
all
are
all
based
upon
self-serving
statements
which
were
submitted
with
its
application
to
the
icc
for
the
discontinuance.
these
have
never
been
tested
at
a
hearing
and
i
think
that
although
the
court
below
has
learned
in
law,
i
think
that
the
administrative
agency
with
its
experts
is
the
correct
body
to
explore
these
financial
losses
and
find
out
why
or
whether
or
not
they
are
valid
and
--
or
the
loss
of
passengers
to
determine
whether
that's
valid.
i
say
that
if
the
court
below
is
--
the
judgment
below
is
affirmed
then
for
all
the
country
perhaps
new
jersey
hasn't
lost
its
regulatory
jurisdiction
over
all
of
the
train
service
in
or
--
all
of
the
intrastate
train
service
because
all
of
our
trains
connected
one
way
or
another
with
some
other
type
of
vehicle
for
a
trip
across
the
river
either
on
--
at
the
new
york's
terminal
or
in
south
jersey
at
camden
and
philadelphia
terminal.
mr.
william
gural
yes,
sir.
and
--
mr.
william
gural
either
by
--
mr.
william
gural
by
sub
--
by
hudson
tubes
or
by
--
mr.
william
gural
they
would
be,
yes
sir
because
the
railroads
would
then
point
to
the
--
to
this
decision
and
say,
you
don't
look
at
where
the
train
is
going
any
more,
you
look
at
where
the
passenger
is
going,
you
look
at
the
tickets,
this
trip
takes
him
across
the
river
now.
mr.
william
gural
yes
sir.
there
are
--
the
lackawanna
operates
some
ferries
and
the
central
railroad
of
new
jersey
also
operates
ferries
from
jersey
city.
i
respectfully
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
dissenting
opinion
which
i
think
expresses
correctly
the
application
of
the
law
in
this
case.
that's
all
i
have.
mr.
william
gural
i
just
wanted
to
make
an
observation
--
mr.
william
gural
yes.
well,
that
would
be
the
intrastate
faith
but
--
mr.
william
gural
no,
my
argument
is
that
the
whole
operation
from
butler
to
susquehanna
transfer
is
an
intrastate
operation.
that
this
connecting
bus
--
mr.
william
gural
well,
i'm
afraid
that
if
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
permitted
the
discontinuance
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
decides
that
this
is
an
interstate
operation
and
permitted
discontinuance,
i'm
afraid
the
state's
ousted
from
jurisdiction.
the
state
can
no
longer
--
mr.
william
gural
well,
i
can
only
--
mr.
william
gural
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
gural
that's
our
argument.
mr.
william
gural
in
that
respect
although
that's
not
the
entire
trip.
mr.
william
gural
and
not
only
that,
susquehanna
transfer
--
mr.
william
gural
exactly.
mr.
william
gural
or
to
susquehanna
transfer
which
is
also
within
new
jersey.
it
runs
--
it's
entire
run
is
within
the
state
of
new
jersey.
mr.
william
gural
no,
that
would
be
an
interstate
train's
act.
i've
just
--
mr.
william
gural
yes
sir.
i
did
want
to
point
out
that
in
page
16
of
the
record,
counsel
contradicts
me.
he
says
that
there
is
no
provision
for
tolls,
tariffs
and
fare
page
16
in
the
record
i
quote
from
their
tariff.
number
two,
motor
coach
fare
in
each
direction
between
north
bergen,
new
jersey
and
new
york
is
25
cents.
mr.
william
gural
yes
sir,
if
we
found
--
if
the
state
found
public
convenience
and
necessity
required
such
as
service,
we
could
order
--
however
--
mr.
william
gural
no
sir,
because
the
way
13
(a)
works
if
the
interstate
commerce
commission
does
not
choose
to
investigate,
they
have
to
make
up
their
mind
within
20
days
of
debate
with
these
notices
to
investigate
and
if
they
don't
do
that,
those
trains
--
under
the
statute,
those
trains
automatically
go
off.
mr.
william
gural
i
--
i
--
mr.
william
gural
yes
sir,
i
must
disagree
because
i
think
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
at
this
point
(voice
overlap)
by
fairly
--
mr.
william
gural
well
--
mr.
william
gural
that's
--
that
would
be
the
proceeding
--
mr.
william
gural
we
would
like
to
--
we
would
like
to
extend
the
hearing
and
explore
this
application
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
gets
it.
now,
i
also
want
to
point
out
one
other
item
in
the
appellee's
brief
wherein
page
23
of
the
appellee's
briefs,
he
supposedly
quotes,
the
bus
service
--
about
eight
lines
down
to
beginning,
“the
bus
service
is
an
intra-terminal
transfer
of
passengers
in
aid
of
and
as
an
incident
of
the
rail
service
that
when
susquehanna's
trains
are
at
north
bergen,
new
jersey
or
grants
the
susquehanna
transfer,
they
are
within
the
susquehanna's”
and
then
in
quotes,
“terminal
area
at
new
york
in
respect
of
both
rate
and
passenger
service”.
now,
i
submit
the
record
doesn't
bear
not
on
that
because
at
page
48
of
the
record,
the
quote
is,
“we
concluded
that
susquehanna
transfer
applicant
have
entered
this
terminal
area
at
new
york
in
respect
of
both
freight
and
passenger
traffic.”
the
decision
that
he
quotes
from
--
he
doesn't
use
the
word
“service”
he
uses
the
word
“traffic.”
now,
his
suggestion
that
the
determination
of
susquehanna
transfers
terminal
area
at
new
york
and
its
res
judicata,
it
is
--
but
in
this
context,
it's
the
terminal
area
and
not
a
train.
and
again,
i
must
keep
using
this
term
because
a
train
is
something
else
than
a
terminal
area
and
the
statute
doesn't
allow
to
discontinue
a
terminal
area.
it
only
allows
them
to
discontinue
a
train.
and
i
say
that
the
train
is
something
less
than
a
terminal
area.
now,
i
think
justice
white
also
asked
the
question
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
this
bus
was
an
extension
of
railroad
under
--
and
that
sections
--
at
records
page
77,
this
--
the
interstate
commerce
commission
made
a
definite
finding
after
the
citation
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
and
we
conclude
for
the
reasons
there
stated
that
applicants
described
motor
operation
is
not
an
extension
of
railroad,
it
is
contemplated
by
section
118.
the
certificate
requirements
of
section
118
therefore
are
enact
--
inapplicable.
whereas,
the
question
justice
white
that
you
have
with
respect
to
a
ferry,
the
ferry
is
regarded
as
a
line
of
railroad
and
as
it's
these
ferry
cases
that
made
that
determination.
mr.
william
gural
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
gural
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
gural
well,
i
think
the
appellee
has
two
courses
open
for
him.
he
may
either
come
to
the
state
and
make
his
application
pursuant
to
13a
(2)
and
then
if
we
deny
him
the
relief
or
do
not
act
within
four
months
on
his
application,
he
may
then
go
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
who
give
a
full
hearing
on
the
merits.
mr.
william
gural
yes
sir,
a
full
hearing
exploring
--
mr.
william
gural
not
as
i
read
the
statute
sir
but
he
can't
--
i
think
he
also
has
available
to
him
the
procedure
that
was
suggested
in
our
response
to
his
motion
to
lift
the
injunction.
that
is
--
we
decided
back
in
july
of
1960
when
his
application
to
discontinue
all
of
the
trains,
we
permit
that
--
to
discontinue
just
one
of
those
trains
in
these
directions
so
that
they
are
down
to
three
trains
now.
there
is
no
reason
why
under
13a
(2),
he
couldn't
then.
july
of
1960
made
his
application
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
as
i
say
it,
it's
only
speculation.
i
feel
that
perhaps
at
that
time
again,
and
i
insist
the
speculation
that
maybe
he
could
not
approve
in
the
elements
that
are
required
under
13a
(2)
namely
that
present
and
future
public
convenience
and
necessity
permits
such
discontinuance
and
that
the
continuation
of
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
gural
it's
--
they
may
have
different
rules
of
evidence,
yes
sir
and
maybe
--
mr.
william
gural
different
approach,
yes,
like
the
icc
has
the
national
approach
and
--
mr.
william
gural
we
usually
allow
20
days
from
the
time
of
the
application
for
an
answer
to
be
filed
and
then
usually
within
10
days
after
that,
we
put
it
down
for
a
hearing
--
mr.
william
gural
--
although
--
mr.
william
gural
well,
we've
been
furnishing
these
hearings
within
a
period
of
fourth
months,
within
120
days
--
mr.
william
gural
yes
sir,
because
the
statute
requires
us
to
do
that
otherwise
if
we
don't
dispose
of
it
--
mr.
william
gural
well,
then
he
files
petition
to
the
icc
and
of
course
--
mr.
william
gural
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
gural
well,
then
under
the
statute
which
operates
automatically,
these
trains
go
off
because
the
icc
failed
to
order
the
continuance
as
the
statute
requires
it.
mr.
william
gural
no,
we're
out.
mr.
william
gural
our
jurisdiction
--
mr.
william
gural
let
me
read
you
the
statute.
the
carrier
files
his
notices.
upon
the
filing
of
such
notice,
the
commission
shall
have
authority
during
the
said
30
days
notice
period
either
upon
complaint
or
upon
its
own
initiative
without
complaint
to
enter
upon
an
investigation
of
the
proposed
discontinuance
or
change.
upon
the
institution
of
such
investigation,
the
commission
by
orders,
served
upon
the
carrier
or
carriers
affected
thereby
at
least
10
days
prior
to
the
day
on
which
such
discontinuance
or
change
would
otherwise
become
effective
may
require
such
train
or
ferry
to
be
continued.
now,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
said
it
had
no
jurisdiction.
it
didn't
issue
the
order
that
the
statute
calls
for.
mr.
william
gural
this
--
mr.
william
gural
yes,
sir.
and
--
but
the
court
now
has
said
that
they
do
have
jurisdiction
and
that's
where
--
where
--
mr.
william
gural
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
decision
if
they
had
no
jurisdiction
was
reversed
by
the
court
below.
the
court
said
the
icc
did
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
gural
because
the
statute
said
that
the
icc
had
to
--
have
acted
back
when
these
notices
were
posted
and
ordered
the
continuance
of
this
service
and
conduct
an
investigation.
it
would
be
ver
--
it
would
not
revert
back.
the
trains
under
this
--
this
is
a
self
--
an
automatic
statute,
it
permits
--
if
the
icc
fails
to
act,
the
trains
go
off.
mr.
william
gural
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
gural
if
it's
an
interstate
train,
--
if
it's
an
interstate
train
and
they
investigate
the
discontinuance
then
they
must
conclude
it
within
four
months.
mr.
william
gural
but
if
it's
a
--
mr.
william
gural
well,
no
they
have
to
--
if
they
find
that
the
trains
are
--
operation
of
the
trains
are
required
by
public
convenience
and
necessity
and
will
not
unduly
--
burden
interstate
or
foreign
commerce,
the
commission
then
may
require
that
they
run
for
one
more
year.
on
the
other
hand,
on
the
intrastate
face
of
it,
the
commission
is
not
bound
by
such
a
time
limit.
it
does
not
need
to
adhere
to
a
four-month
time
limit,
if
it's
an
intrastate.
mr.
william
gural
the
railroad
--
mr.
william
gural
well
--
mr.
william
gural
there's
a
file
tariff
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
wherein
the
--
well
--
mr.
william
gural
that's
all
it
would
take
because
this
is
the
only
obligation.
this
is
not
a
certificated
operation.
this
is
an
operation
incidental
to
rail
service,
not
incidental
to
a
train
but
incidental
to
a
rail
service
which
is
not
the
same
as
a
certificated
operation.
and
the
only
thing
they
have
to
do
is
file
a
tariff,
amend
their
tariff
and
say
that
the
bus
service
is
no
longer
going
to
be
continued.
however,
the
fact
that
they
file
amendment
to
the
tariff
does
not
mean
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
will
accept
it
for
filing
because
the
interstate
commerce
commission
might
say,
well
look
here,
where
are
your
new
york
people
--
how
your
new
york
people
going
to
get
over
him
--
they'll
suspend
the
tariff
and
may
be
conduct
an
investigation
and
refuse
to
accept
the
filing.
there's
a
procedure
for
that.
i
think
that's
all,
your
honor.
oh,
excuse
me,
just
one
other
point.
i'm
sorry.
i
just
wanted
to
point
out,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
determination
in
this
thing
--
in
this
case
that
it
lacks
jurisdiction
is
entitled
to
persuasive
weight.
they've
been
administering
this
law
since
1958
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
so
held
in
several
of
its
cases
that
the
administrative
body
that
is
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
law,
its
opinions
with
respect
to
that
law
are
entitled
to
persuasive
weight.
thank
you,
sir.
