--
no
particular
weights
given

its
finance,
they
give
it
simply
with
respectful
consideration.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
your
situation
have
been
different,
if
instead
of
having
a
contractual
arrangement
with
the
buses
where
your
railroad
line
stopped,
you've
simply
deposited
the
passengers
and
let
them
take
a
regular
bus
service
running
to
new
york,
issuing
however,
yourselves
through
ticket?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
say
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
who
didn't
want
to
go
to
new
york,
or
should
go
to
new
york
but
those
who
did,
do
you
sell
them
through
ticket
which
would
be
honored.
justice
john
m.
harlan
might
be
different?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
question
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
about
the
practicality
of
this.
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
you
prevail,
what
is
the
course
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean
does
he
have
to
start
--
do
they
have
to
start
all
over
again
in
the
icc?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
icc
can't
call
this
application
advanced
and
say
in
writing
out
in
a
piece
of
paper
application?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
reaffirming
into
the
icc
is
one
thing
and
proving
it
to
the
local
agencies
is
another?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
may
give
a
rule
and
different
approach.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
soon
--
how
soon
would
--
if
you
prevail,
how
long
would
it
take
to
get
a
hearing
before
the
state
agency?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
how
long
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
how
long
a
period
is
--
the
period
gestation
before
you
get
in?
justice
john
m.
harlan
from
the
time
issue
is
joined?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
you
lose,
how
long
does
it
take
to
get
a
hearing
in
the
icc?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i
meant,
supposing
you
lose
this
case,
supposing
you
lose
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
the
icc
would
be
told
they
did
have
jurisdiction,
how
long
would
--?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
took
it
out,
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
understand
that
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
start.
