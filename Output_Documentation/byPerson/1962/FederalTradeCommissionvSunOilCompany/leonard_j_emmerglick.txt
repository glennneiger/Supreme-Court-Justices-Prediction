mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
words
of
this
statute
and
particularly
the
words
of
the
proviso
maybe
described
by
an
observation
of
mr.
justice
holmes.
a
“word”
he
said
is
not
a
crystal,
transparent
and
unchanged
with
the
skin
of
a
living
thought.
the
words
of
this
proviso
are
opaque,
but
more
they
are
imprecise
as
this
court
has
had
occasion
more
than
once
to
point
out,
beginning
in
staley
and
continuing
in
subsequent
decisions.
a
microscopic
view
which
walks
upon
the
words
of
this
proviso
will
not
serve
to
disclose
its
reach.
the
court
below
therefore
took
a
panoramic
view
of
the
statute,
of
the
antitrust
laws,
and
of
the
economic
realities
involved
in
the
marketing
of
gasoline
and
saw
that
suppliers
indeed
compete
for
the
business
of
motorists
that
suppliers
are
indirect
in
continuous
communication
with
them.
the
court
then
centered
its
attention
on
19th
and
pearl
streets,
a
residential
area
in
which
most
of
the
buyers
are
highly
price
conscious
coming
from
low
income
groups.
the
commission
looks
upon
the
words
of
the
statute
narrowly
and
in
adopting
its
construction,
it
told
some
to
do
one
of
two
things;
to
reduce
its
price
to
all
dealers,
when
the
dealer
like
mclean
finds
himself
subjected
to
a
price
rate
by
a
chain
retailer
or
to
go
into
direct
retailing.
that
result
was
not
found
by
the
court
below
to
be
consistent
with
a
proper
construction
of
the
statute
or
the
spirit
and
purpose
of
the
antitrust
laws
as
a
whole.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
yes.
the
commission
had
adopted
as
an
administrative
practice,
the
sanctioning
of
just
such
price
assistance
as
is
involved
here
from
1954
until
either
the
end
of
1955
or
early
1956.
at
that
time
as
the
court
below
found,
the
commission
changed
its
mind
and
adopted
a
different
position
in
a
letter
written
by
the
chairman
of
the
commission
to
a
congressional
committee,
until
that
letter
came
to
our
attention
when
it
became
public
in
early
1956,
it
was
well
known
to
be
the
commission's
view
that
price
assistance
of
this
sort
was
consistent
with
the
statute
and
within
the
2
(b)
defense.
this
is
elaborated
in
detail
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
texas
company,
the
correspondence
is
set
out
in
full
in
an
appendix
to
that
brief.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
well
before
1954,
the
statute
was
in
language
when
it
was
construed
definitively,
was
in
a
language
different
than
the
language
which
is
involved
now
and
which
was
involved
in
1954.
the
statute
at
one
time
spoke
of
the
meeting
of
the
--
meeting
of
competition.
it
was
amended
to
read
upon
the
meeting
of
a
lower
price
of
a
competitor.
it
is
our
reading
of
the
legislative
history
that
the
purpose
of
that
amendment
was
to
prevent
a
beating
of
a
lower
price
rather
than
a
meeting,
but
not
to
disturb
at
all
the
essence
of
the
defense.
and
this
court,
in
standard
oil,
in
340
u.s.
said
that
despite
all
of
the
amendments
to
the
statute,
the
core
of
the
defense
was
not
at
all
effective
and
that
it
continued
to
be
that
wherever
a
lawful
lower
price
of
a
competitor
threatens
to
deprive
a
seller
of
a
customer,
the
seller
to
retain
that
customer
may
in
good
faith
meet
that
lower
price.
now,
what
is
involved
here
is
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
super
test,
a
chain
retailer
to
deprive
sun
of
a
customer
it's
outlet
mclean
by
deep
price
cuts
over
weekends
and
sporadically
from
time
to
time
so
that
sun
could
not
readily
respond
to
them,
deep
price
cuts
of
as
much
as
5
cents
a
gallon.
now,
the
commission's
position
is
that
if
super
test
had
made
an
offer
to
mclean
to
sell
him
gasoline
at
a
lower
price,
sun
could
have
met
that
offer
by
giving
mclean
a
discount.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
oh,
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
who
super
test
was.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
or
the
super
test
company
as
a
chain
retailer
having
enough
gasoline
to
supply
65
stations.
if
for
example,
that
your
point
itself
was
an
abundance
--
an
over
abundance
of
gasoline
and
should
try
to
establish
additional
outlets
or
if
it
should
find
that
it
could
make
large
long-term
contracts
which
would
lower
its
cost,
if
it
could
only
find
some
more
useful
outlets,
if
then
super
test
offered
mclean
gasoline
at
2
cents
a
gallon
less
than
what's
on
--
was
the
charge
of
it,
sun
says,
the
commission
could
meet
that
price
and
this
court
said
essentially
that
in
standard
oil.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
that
is
clearly
within
the
literal
words
of
the
statute.
now,
if
that
had
happened,
sun
could
have
discriminated
against
these
four
dealers
working
upon
them,
we
will
assume
the
same
competitive
injury
as
to
the
[inaudible]
by
giving
mclean
price
[inaudible].
this
coincides
with
the
commission's
view,
but
the
reality
is
that
sun
is
just
as
much
deprived
of
mclean
as
an
outlet
by
price
cuts,
by
super
test
of
5
cents
a
gallon
which
threatened
to
destroy
them
and
if
super
test
wins
him
over
by
offering
2
cents
of
gallon.
in
either
case,
the
core
of
the
matter
as
this
court
put
it
in
standard
oil,
the
core
of
the
matter
is
that
sun
is
being
deprived
of
the
customer
and
the
defense
exists
to
enable
a
seller
to
defend
himself
against
such
a
price
rate.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
that
is
the
essential
question.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
it's
the
only
question.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
yes.
no,
if
this
statute
were
a
statute
which
did
not
meet
structure,
we
would
not
be
here
but
it
is
so
--
inartificially
drawn
as
this
court
and
other
courts
have
found
that
we
must
search
for
its
meaning
by
resort
to
reason
to
analogy
the
consistency
of
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
on
the
level
of
reason,
i
submit
that
if
we
could
discriminate
to
meet
a
super
test
offer
or
an
offer
of
a
major
to
say
to
mclean
that
essentially,
competition
is
being
just
as
much
protected
by
giving
him
the
kind
of
assistance
that
we
could
give
him.
now
this
kind
of
an
attack
upon
super
test
--
upon
mclean,
could
be
made
by
companies
only
differ
from
super
test.
this
is
not
a
confrontation
simply
between
sun
oil
company
and
a
chain
retailer
called
a
private
brand
or
an
independent.
for
example,
if
a
west
coast
refinery
[inaudible]
should
determined
into
come
in
to
the
eastern
market,
it
could
do
so
and
to
break
into
the
market,
the
lower
prices
of
the
station
office
of
mclean,
without
violating
the
law,
and
sun
would
be
confronted
by
a
major
competitor
of
formidable
size.
for
example,
to
spend
just
a
moment
more
on
this,
union
oil
company
is
in
california
in
a
case
pending
in
the
ninth
circuit
is
shown
to
be
marketing
gasoline
by
consigning,
not
selling.
if
the
union
oil
company
determined
to
go
into
the
florida
market
and
located
the
station
office
of
mclean
and
there
sold
gasoline
through
an
agent
to
whom
gasoline
was
consigned
and
dropped
the
price
to
break
into
the
market,
3
or
4
or
5
cents
surely,
sun
should
be
in
a
position
to
meet
that
competition.
now
it's
the
view
of
the
commission
that
we
must
reduce
our
price
to
all
dealers.
this
is
what
the
commission
said
in
its
decision.
in
its
brief
in
this
court,
the
commission
said
that
we
should
reduce
our
price
to
all
dealers
in
the
area.
now,
there
is
great
difficulty,
however,
in
determining
what
the
area
shall
be
and
to
remain
free
regardless
of
the
determination
of
a
lawsuit
by
the
commission
and
likely
determination
that
you
have
violated
your
office
in
top
of
that.
may
i
take
a
few
minutes
to
point
out
why
that
is
so?
i
just
want
to
focus
the
attention
if
we
may
on
mclean
for
a
moment
by
way
of
introduction.
the
only
source
of
help
which
was
available
to
mclean
was
sun.
while
super
test
with
its
chain
of
resources
could
fix
any
price
it
pleased,
mclean's
ability
to
compete
depended
upon
sun's
price
to
him.
if
to
help
mclean,
sun
had
to
reduce
its
price
everywhere
not
only
would
that
be
economically
unreasonable
and
not
supportive
and
active
sound
business
judgment,
but
it
would
have
several
profound
consequences.
suppose
sun
reduced
its
price
everywhere,
there
would
be
no
discrimination
and
we
would
have
no
problem.
as
soon
as
sun
tried
to
narrow
everywhere
and
to
define
a
market,
the
problem
is
presented.
for
in
the
first
place,
sun
might
select
too
wide
an
area,
the
whole
of
florida
for
example
and
then
there
would
be
a
great
risk
of
primary
line
discrimination,
the
kind
of
discrimination
identified
by
this
court
in
moore
against
mead's
fine
bread
or
the
kind
of
discrimination
found
to
exist
in
the
pure
oil
case
to
which
my
learned
friend
referred.
in
pure
oil,
pure
reduced
its
price
to
all
of
its
dealers
in
birmingham,
but
not
to
its
dealers
elsewhere.
this
was
found
to
be
primary
line
discrimination,
hurtful
to
the
independent
chain
retailers
in
birmingham.
second,
we
risk
selecting
two
narrow
an
area
and
a
charge
of
the
secondary
line
price
discrimination
even
if
we
select
an
area
larger
than
mclean,
the
only
one
who
seemed
to
be
hurt
by
the
bouncing
ball
kind
of
price
discrimination
which
was
off
again
and
on
again
every
few
days.
the
most
illuminating
decision
on
this
subject
has
come
down
recently
from
the
federal
trade
commission
and
when
considered
with
its
decision
in
this
case,
exhibits
the
profound
difficulties
which
the
trade
commission's
doctrine
presents.
in
american
oil,
it
appeared
that
paraland
was
a
private
brand
and
the
shell
oil
company,
a
major,
reduced
its
price
to
narrow
the
two
cents
brand
between
the
paraland
and
shell.
american
then
went
down
in
smyrna,
but
not
in
marietta,
these
being
adjacent
communities.
the
court
found
that
american
who
was
guilty
of
secondary
line
discrimination
because
the
dealers
in
marietta
were
injured.
so
the
selection
of
an
entire
community
did
not
protect
it
from
a
charge
of
discrimination.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
that
case
is
in
our
brief
your
honor.
the
court
could
--
in
the
index.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
it
is
the
trade
commission
--
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
there
was
nothing
but
the
docket
number.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
american
oil
company.
i
plan,
however,
to
further
enlighten
the
court
by
referring
to
some
parts
of
the
opinion
of
that
case
--
of
that
proceeding.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
that
is
it
and
in
his
dissent,
he
calls
attention
to
the
dilemma
which
a
marketer
confronts
and
since
it
is
only
the
commission
decision,
may
i
read
an
excerpt
from
his
dissent
which
states
the
argument
most
forcibly?
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
yes.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
it
is
on
page
26
in
our
brief.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
if
american
had
chosen
to
give
equally
large
discounts
to
its
marietta
dealers,
where
could
it
have
safely
stopped.
smyrna
and
marietta
are
located
along
a
major
north-south
highway
with
gasoline
stations
in
every
town
along
the
way.
a
price
cut
to
any
station
or
group
of
stations
would
be
bound
to
affect
the
sales
of
nearby
stations
up
or
down
the
road.
and
if
american
made
its
reductions
to
all
stations
on
this
highway,
there
would
undoubtedly
be
effects
upon
stations
located
on
adjacent
and
intersecting
roads.
under
the
commission's
theory,
american's
only
safe
alternative
would
be
to
reduce
its
prices
to
all
of
its
dealers
everywhere.
but
if
the
commission
prepared
to
say
that
this
enlargement
of
the
local
[inaudible]
buyer
into
a
nuclear
price
war
would
have
effects
upon
competition
less
injurious
than
those
of
the
course
of
action
which
american
actually
pursued.
now,
the
sequel
to
this
came
just
the
other
day
and
as
i've
said,
shell
was
the
first
major
to
go
down
in
this
area.
in
the
reply
brief
filed
yesterday
by
the
petitioner,
it
is
only
argued
that
there
need
be
no
concern
about
the
area
of
price
discrimination
because
the
commission
has
stated
its
policy
be
that
surely
there
would
be
some
fringe
effects
that
these
will
not
bring
it
about
that
there
will
be
a
violation
of
the
statute.
and
in
support
of
that
argument
at
page
6
of
the
reply
brief,
the
argument
was
on
that
a
representative
of
shell
oil
company
testified
before
a
congressional
committee
looking
into
this
subject
that
such
price
assistance
as
they
give
dealers
is
now
offered
to
all
their
dealers
in
a
competitive
retail
marketing
area.
well
last
week,
the
commission
filed
a
complaint
against
shell
because
it
gave
assistance
to
its
dealers
in
smyrna
as
american
did.
so
the
dilemma
which
is
presented
by
the
commission's
tortured
reading
of
the
statute
is
one
which
makes
practical
market
limitation
and
impossibility
--
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
gave
assistance?
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
cut
prices
in
one
form
or
another,
sometimes
by
lowering
the
tank
wagon,
sometimes
without
lowering
the
tank
wagon
by
making
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
gave
lower
prices.
now
a
further
difficulty
is
presented.
price
assistance
must
be
in
good
faith.
good
faith
means
among
other
things
that
the
price
must
meet
but
not
beat
the
lower
price.
but
it
also
means
that
a
market
area
geared
to
the
price
attack
must
be
selected
or
if
a
different
market
area
is
selected,
then
price
wars
are
certain
to
be
generated
in
remote
areas
where
there
has
been
no
need
for
this
lower
price
and
a
warrant
good
faith
is
very
likely
the
conclusion
which
will
come.
now,
the
other
alternative
of
the
commission
then
is
to
go
into
direct
retail
and
this
--
the
commission
explicitly
advises
it
might
do
if
it
needed
a
direct
price
release
upon
its
business
which
is
really
one
that's
involved
by
chains
like
super
test.
now,
it
is
our
submission
that
the
elimination
of
the
independent
dealer
from
the
american
scene
was
not
one
of
the
purposes
of
congress
in
adopting
the
robinson-patman
act.
there
were
two
main
evils
which
the
price
discrimination
law
seeks
to
deal
with.
the
first
was
identified
before
the
robinson-patman
act
was
adopted.
that
statute,
if
we
take
back
originally,
was
adopted
to
prevent
a
driving
out
of
competing
sellers
by
price
discrimination,
something
we
have
come
to
term
or
here
termed
as
primary
line
discrimination.
when
the
robinson-patman
act
came,
it
was
to
deal
with
another
evil
primarily,
the
confine
of
a
competitive
advantage
on
large
chain
buyers
by
giving
them
lower
discriminatory
prices.
neither
of
those
evils
is
involved
here.
primary
line
discrimination
charge
is
not
charged.
mclean
was
not
a
large
chain
buyer.
he
was
our
outlet
that
we
were
trying
to
protect
and
a
moment's
reflection
would
show
that
a
marketer
like
sun
gains
nothing
by
helping
mclean
at
the
expense
of
gallonage
sold
by
nearby
sun
dealers.
it's
merely
taking
gallonage
from
one
dealer
and
transferring
it
to
another.
at
the
same
time,
we
make
our
dealers
unhappy
and
dissatisfied
and
we
gave
nothing
at
all
by
discriminating
in
price
and
helping
less
than
all
who
are
under
attack.
we
gave
price
assistance
to
mclean.
he
was
the
only
one
who
seemed
to
be
hurt.
other
marketers
did
not
give
any
assistance
to
their
dealers
until
six
weeks
later.
then
the
hurt
became
apparent
to
all
marketers
and
then
we
gave
assistance
to
all
of
our
dealers.
there
was
no
--
mr.

j.
emmerglick
in
jacksonville.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
we
cut
the
prices,
yes.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
yes,
we
cut
prices,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
yes.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
it
would
not
be
any
different
mr.
chief
justice
if
we
look
to
the
fundamental
basic
premise
of
our
position
which
is
that
a
gasoline
supplier
of
grand
profit
is
in
competition
for
the
business
of
motorists.
he
almost
in
a
sense
reaches
over
the
dealer
to
make
direct
contact
with
motorists.
he
maintains
the
bulk
of
these
supplies,
the
dealer
having
very
little
storage
deposit
and
he
provides
a
uniform
product.
he
keeps
the
brand
in
high
esteem
and
the
dealer
is
as
mr.
justice
jackson
put
it
in
his
dissent
in
the
standard
stations
case,
a
conduit
so
that
the
verity
is
that
the
supplier
of
a
branded
product
is
in
competition
for
the
business
of
the
motors
with
anyone
else
who
is
seeking
that
business.
now,
this
is
of
course
a
theoretical
possibility
that
such
a
situation
might
arise.
i
would
point
out
that
it
is
not
very
likely
that
sun
would
exercising
judgment
lower
its
price
where
a
dealer
without
any
assistance
from
a
supplier,
a
single
dealer
lowered
his
price
in
competition
with
mclean
and
the
evidence
of
that
is
that
for
four
months,
sun
carefully
refrains
from
doing
anything
to
help
mclean.
in
retrospect,
we
acted
too
late,
but
this
evidence
is
the
unlikely
one
that
absent
an
attack
of
an
aggressive
sort
why
someone
like
a
chain
or
like
another
major
able
because
of
superior
resources
to
destroy
mclean.
as
to
that
kind
of
attack,
it
is
unlikely
that
sun
would
give
assistance
but
in
the
presence
of
such
a
confrontation
as
existed
here,
a
chain
retailer
with
65
stations
versus
a
small
businessman,
mclean,
sun
i
think
had
given
a
situation
like
that
as
the
statute
permit
as
construed
here
might
come
to
the
assistance
of
it,
every
dealer
who
seems
to
be
hurt
might
be
expected
to
do
so.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
throughout
the
city
of
jacksonville.
the
[inaudible]
that
super
test
triggered
a
price
war
in
mid-february.
this
price
war
came
about
first
by
the
reduction
throughout
the
city
of
prices
by
a
number
of
majors,
and
thereupon,
some
reduced
its
price,
lowered
its
price
to
all
its
dealers
throughout
the
city.
the
elimination
of
the
independent
dealer
is
threatened
by
the
commission's
interpretation
and
the
argument
in
the
brief
of
the
commission
before
this
court
attempts
to
suggest
that
this
has
not
been
taken
seriously
but
there
is
no
likelihood
that
major
gasoline
suppliers
would
go
back
to
direct
retail.
well,
now
in
standard
oil
of
california,
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
dissent,
pointed
out
that
a
narrow
construction
of
section
3
of
the
clayton
act
would
set
the
stage
for
direct
retailing
or
the
use
of
agency
which
he
said
in
practical
effect
means
control
the
refilling
stations
by
the
oil
companies.
now
that
development,
your
honors,
has
come
about.
the
union
oil
company
is
shown
by
this
proceeding
pending
in
the
ninth
circuit
to
be
consigning
gasoline.
two
proceedings
pending
in
the
federal
trade
commissions,
attack
consignment
operations
in
the
marketing
of
gasoline,
one
of
them
against
the
sun
oil
company,
and
in
the
record
in
that
case,
it
appears
that
sun
adopted
the
method
of
offering
consignment
to
its
dealers
in
the
norfolk
market
area
because
a
few
weeks
before,
the
complaint
in
this
proceeding
was
filed
against
it,
and
because
of
the
difficulties
in
determining
just
where
to
draw
the
line
in
market
delimitation
and
to
be
free
when
you
draw
it
from
either
primary
line
or
secondary
line
charges
or
both
and
to
be
sure
that
you
have
the
benefit
of
the
proviso
because
if
you
draw
the
line,
you
still
don't
have
the
benefit
of
the
proviso
of
the
commission's
view
was
sound.
and
if
you
don't
have
the
benefit
of
the
proviso,
you
can't
draw
any
line,
you
must
reduce
prices
to
everybody.
now,
no
such
[inaudible]
results
fall
from
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
in
the
court
below.
the
mclean's
of
this
world
can
be
preserved
from
price
range
by
chains
and
powerful
majors
through
price
assistance
carefully
geared
to
be
defensive
and
solely
defensive.
predatory
pricing
is
not
facilitated.
the
commission's
view
is
claimed
in
its
brief
to
be
grounded
and
appear
that
the
other
view
will
promote
predatory
pricing.
for
that,
if
it
should
exist,
could
be
easily
detected.
the
difference
between
predatory
pricing
and
defensive
pricing
is
manifestly
clearly
in
this
case.
the
state
of
affairs
is
not
big
sun
versus
little
super
test.
it
was
super
test
which
attacked
mclean,
sun
merely
reacted
when
mclean
appealed
to
it
for
help
and
as
it
was
reacted
with
perhaps
too
much
circumspection
and
care
before
deciding
to
give
him
help.
now
of
course
it
is
true
--
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
well,
perhaps
we
should
have
helped
him
shortly
than
waiting
for
four
months,
your
honor.
i
think
we
would
have
been
barred
from
doing
so
if
we
had
waited
for
four
months.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
well,
we
think
that
--
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
we
think
it
makes
no
difference.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
because
super
test
is
a
chain
retailer
at
least
--
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
well,
the
record
shows
that
it
has
65
retail
stations.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
it
does
not
affect
our
position.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
because
the
market's
confrontation
is
the
same.
super
test
versus
mclean
had
we
defensively
undertaking
to
preserve
him
from
aggressive
price
attack.
mr.
leonard
j.
emmerglick
yes
indeed.
[laughter]
well,
may
i
add
one
more
comment
on
that,
on
that
subject?
there
was
an
augmenting
of
the
force
and
vigor
of
competition
when
super
test
if
it
had
one
station
or
65
stations
lowered
its
price,
the
competition
was
theoretically
benefited
by
that
act.
and
if
the
situation
went
on
that
way,
there
would
be
an
augmenting
of
competition
compared
with
the
situation
just
before.
now
if
in
addition,
sun
can
help
mclean
lower
his
price,
there
is
a
further
augmentation
of
competition
so
that
the
competition
is
aided
and
the
fundamental
aims
of
the
antitrust
laws
are
promoted
by
the
construction
of
the
court
below.
