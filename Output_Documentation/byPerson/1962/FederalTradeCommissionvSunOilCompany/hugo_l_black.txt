below
all
level?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
merely
sun
but
below
all
level?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
sun
was
the
only
one
that
cut
the
prices
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
to
all
the
customers
in
that
community
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
that
area
or
whatever
area
you
want
to
call
it,
all
in
that
county
for
instance,
suppose
all
the
others
did
cut
it
down?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
county.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
it
--
suppose
that
all
the
local
dealers,
not
just
the
tank
wagon,
the
ones
who'd
sell
it
to
me
when
i
go
by,
suppose
all
of
them
in
that
county
had
cut
it
down
except
sun
and
then
sun
cut
it
down,
what
would
be
the
situation
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
in
that
county
but
didn't
do
it
in
the
next
county.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
of
the
country,
i
think.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
i
run
up
in
areas
in
the
country
wherein
the
whole
counties,
you
feel
like
you're
coming
into
an
oasis
in
the
desert
because
you
find
all
of
them
had
cut
down
there
to
sell
to
the
automobile
owner.
what
situation
--
would
that
make
any
difference?
you'd
not
always
notify
them
in
advance
so
you
can't
always
take
advantage
of
it.
[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
for
instance,
you're
going
from
here
to
florida
and
found
frequently
that
certain
sections
that
seemingly
for
a
whole
county,
it
maybe
a
county-and-half,
there
will
be
what
some
people
call
a
price
war
going
on
and
some
others
would
say
it's
a
place
to
get
cheap
gasoline
and
suppose
all
of
them
have
cut
the
price
there,
all
but
one,
would
he
violate
the
law
if
he
then
cut
it
to
meet
their
prices?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
far
as
--
what
is
the
area,
you
have
to
consider
some
area
in
that
connection,
do
you
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i'm
getting
at.
you
really
have
to
consider
some
areas
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
your
neighboring
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
some
dealers,
you're
talking
about
this,
or
competitor
dealers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
it
does
raise
the
problem
as
to
areas
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
name
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
“gave
assistance”?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
gave
assistance,
you
mean
cut
prices?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
they
gave
lower
prices.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what
area?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
by
that,
you
cut
the
prices.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
understand
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
may
not
be
euphemistic
[inaudible].
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
understand
you.
