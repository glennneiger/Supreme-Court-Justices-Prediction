mr.
robert
b.
hummel
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
an
order,
cease
and
desist
order,
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
the
issue
is,
under
section
2
(a)
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended
by
the
robinson-patman
act,
is
a
violation
to
discriminate
among
customers
where
the
effect
may
be
to
tend
to
create
a
monopoly,
to
tend
to
eliminate
competition,
or
to
injure
competition.
here,
the
question
is,
does
the
section
2
(b)
proviso
to
the
section
2
(a)
violation
which
i
have
just
related
which
exempts
such
a
discrimination,
having
the
proscribed
defect,
where
the
discrimination
is
made
“to
meet
an
equally
low
price
of
a
competitor”
apply
to
a
special
price
made
to
aid
a
customer,
meet
his
competitor’s
price.
in
brief,
the
pertinent
facts
here
are,
the
commission
found
that
the
respondent,
sun
oil
company,
have
violated
section
2
(a)
of
the
act
by
giving
price
concessions
to
one
gilbert
mclean,
an
operator
of
a
retail
service
station
in
jacksonville,
florida,
which
was
not
given
to
other
sun
stations
in
the
area.
the
examiner
and
the
commission
found
that
this
caused
competitive
injury
to
other
stations,
and
specifically
to
the
operators
of
four
other
sun
stations
located
in
the
immediate
area
within
less
than
a
mile
to
three-and-a-half
miles
away.
the
finding
of
competitive
injury
which
was
made
by
the
examiner
and
confirmed
by
the
commission
was
not
appealed.
what
was
appealed
arose
out
of
the
fact
that
the
price,
the
lower
price
given
to
mclean
was
given
because
he
was
losing
business
to
a
cut
rate
station
across
the
street,
a
super
test
station.
it
was
claimed
that
this
was
a
price
made
to
meet
an
equally
low
price
of
a
competitor
within
the
meaning
of
the
proviso
to
section
2
(b).
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
was
within
the
meaning
of
the
proviso,
overruling
the
trade
commission’s
finding
that
it
was
not,
and
we’re
here
to
contest
that
ruling.
i
propose
to
discuss
the
issues
in
the
following
fashion.
first,
i
will
discuss
the
statute
as
applied
to
just
the
limited
facts
which
i
have
related
and
then
i
will
propose
to
discuss
the
statute
as
applied
in
the
economic
setting
and
in
the
light
of
all
the
facts
of
this
case.
turning
to
the
statute
on
the
limited
facts,
the
robinson-patman
act
was
designed
to
assure
equality
of
opportunity
among
customers,
and
by
that
means,
to
promote
the
health
in
small
business
and
of
the
free
enterprise
system.
thus,
the
house
report
which
we
quote
in
our
brief
at
page
27,
states
at
page
8,
the
existing
law
has
in
practice
been
too
restrictive
in
requiring
a
showing
of
general
injury
to
competitive
conditions
in
the
line
of
commerce
concerned,
whereas,
the
more
immediately
important
concern
is
an
injury
to
the
competitor
victimized
by
the
discrimination.
only
through
such
injury,
in
fact,
can
the
larger
general
injury
result.
it
was
pursuant
to
this
philosophy
that
the
robinson-patman
act
was
enacted,
and
to
this
extent,
the
proviso
is
an
exemption
or
an
exception
to
the
major
purpose
of
the
act
for
the
act
reflects
congress’
judgment
that
the
way
to
promote
competition
in
this
area
is
to
assure
that
so
far
as
possible,
there
will
be
equality
of
opportunity
among
the
customers
of
a
particular
seller.
the
act
itself
reflects
dissatisfaction
basically
with
the
scope
of
the
old
“meeting
competition”
defense
which
had
been
in
the
clayton
act.
and
to
that
extent,
if
i
should
use
the
expression
meeting
competition,
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
not
properly
stating
the
content
of
the
section
2
(b)
proviso,
although
i
admit
that
it’s
easy
to
slip
into
this
expression.
we
have
reviewed
the
history
of
the
act
detailed
and
at
length
in
our
brief
and
it
is
reviewed
at
considerable
length
in
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
standard
oil
decision
in
340
u.s.
that
decision
reflected
the
judgment
of
this
court
that
the
section
2
(b)
proviso
was
a
defense,
an
absolute
defense,
three
justices
dissenting
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
fact
--
a
factor
which
the
commission
could
take
into
consideration,
but
need
not
accept
as
an
absolute
defense.
this
court
decided
that
it
was
an
absolute
defense,
but
the
court
concluded,
i
refer
now
to
the
majority
opinion
at
the
conclusion
of
its
opinion,
that
the
proviso
to
section
2
(b)
is
understandable
as
“continuing
in
effect
a
defense
which
is
equally
absolute
but
more
limited
in
scope
than
that
which
existed
under
section
2
of
the
original
clayton
act.”
now
from
this,
we
make
just
the
simple
point
that
the
section
2
(b)
proviso
was
meant
to
limit
the
scope
of
the
so-called
meeting
competition
defense.
it
was
added
as
a
limited
exemption
to
the
main
purpose
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
now
here,
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
words
to
meet
an
equally
low
price
of
a
competitor
need
be
construed
narrowly.
we
are
simply
arguing
that
they
be
construed
in
accordance
with
natural,
normal
usage.
in
natural,
normal
everyday
english,
reference
to
a
competitor
means
ordinarily
someone
who
is
at
the
same
functional
level,
a
manufacturer
against
the
manufacturer,
a
wholesaler
against
the
wholesaler,
a
retailer
against
the
retailer.
i
don’t
intend
to
dwell
on
this
point
too
long,
but
it
seems
to
me
a
point
that
we
have
not
hitherto
given
sufficient
attention.
in
normal
usage,
the
corner
jeweler
selling
elgin
watches
for
example
is
not
a
competitor
of
the
bulova
watch
company
nor
is
the
butcher
who
sells
swift
&
company
meats
ordinarily
considered
a
competitor
of
the
armor
company.
now
i'm
not
saying
that
the
word
competitor
cannot
have
the
vertical
as
well
as
horizontal
meaning,
which
the
expression
clearly
has
in
the
statute.
simply
said
that
in
these
examples,
normal
understanding
is
that
it
has
a
horizontal
meaning
and
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
examples
i
give
are
cases
where
there
is
a
direct
appeal
by
the
manufacturer
to
the
consumer.
there
is
brand
or
loyalty
at
work
and
this
is
not
a
concept
which
is
a
concept
which
is
new
since
the
passage
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
yet
neither
party
to
this
proceeding
nor
the
amicus
or
either
the
friends
of
the
court
has
submitted
any
examples
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
indicating
debate,
reports,
or
otherwise
that
any
members
of
the
congress
considered
the
words
--
the
word
competitor
to
have
this
vertical
impact
that
a
manufacturer
selling
a
branded
article
could
be
in
comp
--
could
be
a
competitor
of
a
retailer.
now,
we're
not
saying
that
there
could
not
be
circumstances
under
which
this
would
be
so
and
under
some
concepts
under
the
antitrust
laws,
this
might
very
well
be
so,
but
we're
dealing
here
with
a
limited
exception
to
a
broad
policy
provision.
this
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes,
this
is
different.
it
is
true
that
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
i
could
perhaps
give
you
the
example
of
a
shirt
store
specializing
in
handling
a
particular
brand
of
shirts
and
very
often
it
carries
the
name
of
the
manufacturer
of
the
shirts,
arrow
shirt
store,
manhattan
shirt
store,
and
it
is
its
primary
article
of
commerce
just
the
retail
gas
--
service
station
sells
other
things
besides
gasoline
and
it
sells
accessories,
tires,
batteries,
and
well,
it
carries
the
name
of
the
supplier
of
gasoline
on
the
station.
it
is
not
under
the
clayton
act
required
to
carry
all
of
the
products
of
the
station
--
of
the
oil
company.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes,
they
do
and
we
say,
our
position
is
that
out
of
that
--
the
extent
to
which
that
station
is
tied
to
a
particular
manufacturer
is
the
result
of
the
choice
of
the
manufacturer
basically.
for
example,
the
sun
oil
company,
there's
a
prior
united
states
government
proceeding
against
sun
oil,
arising
out
of
the
coercive
tactics
which
it
used
to
require
its
dealers
to
carry
the
tires,
batteries,
and
accessories
of
sun,
but
here,
we
have
a
service
station
in
a
position
of
subservience
to
the
supplier.
we
submit
that
this
position
of
subservience
ought
not
to
be
the
occasion
for
bypassing
the
injury
against
which
the
dealer
cannot
protect
himself
because
he
is
the
titled
supplier.
he
can't
go
out
and
find
an
alternative
source
readily
because
that's
not
the
way
the
majors
do
business.
arising
out
of
that
fact,
it
seems
to
us
not
to
be
a
conclusion
that
he
ought
thereby
just
suffer
the
lost
which
the
four
particular
service
station
operators
here
suffered
as
a
result
of
the
discriminatory
price
given
to
the
mclean.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
there
is
a
conclusion
to
this
effect.
i
would
suggest
that
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
there
were
six
price
cuts
in
--
with
respect
to
mclean
that
were
deep
over
a
period
of
six
months
in
the
price
war
which
ensued
when
sun
gave
a
price
cut
to
mclean
which
he
did
not
give
to
its
other
dealers,
there
was
a
period
of
more
than
six
weeks
when
all
of
the
dealers
of
the
area,
including
the
dealers
for
some
six
or
eight
other
majors
who
were
within
a
two-and-a-half
mile
or
two
--
within
a
radius
of
two
or
three
blocks,
were
competing
as
substantial
disadvantage
to
mclean.
mclean
sold
some
better
than
30,000
gallons
of
gasoline
in
the
month
of
january.
the
super
test
station
sold
70,000
gallons
of
gasoline
in
that
same
month
after
the
price
war
which
ensued
when
sun
gave
the
cut
price
to
mclean.
now
that
was
five
or
six
times
as
much
gasoline
as
it
had
been
sold
through
that
corner
previously.
that
gasoline
came
from
somewhere
and
where
it
came
from
was
out
of
the
sales
of
competitive
gasoline
dealers
who
were
not
given
the
same
price
allowance
by
their
supplier,
and
in
particular,
four
sun
dealers
who
lost,
as
i
will
illustrate
later,
more
both
in
gallonage
and
percentage
wise
during
the
month
of
january
than
then
mclean
lost
in
the
entire
six
months
that
he
was
in
competition
with
the
super
test
station
without
the
special
help
of
the
sun
company.
but
to
get
back
to
the
statute
without
the
complicating
additional
facts
for
the
time
being,
this
court
in
the
standard
oil
case
used
the
word
competitor
in
a
number
of
occasions
and
gave
examples
which
were
all
of
this
horizontal
type.
now
the
facts
of
that
case
involved
only
the
horizontal
situation
which
i
am
now
discussing.
so
i'm
not
saying
that
the
court
had
it
be
--
had
that
issue
before
it.
i'm
simply
saying
that
this
is
the
natural,
normal
way,
to
use
the
language,
and
in
all
the
examples
given
in
the
standard
oil
opinion
and
all
the
examples
given
in
the
debate
during
the
robinson-patman
act
history
in
congress,
the
horizontal
meaning,
manufacturer
against
manufacturer,
wholesaler
against
a
wholesaler
was
repeatedly
used.
i
would
suggest
that
to
open
up
by
means
of
the
section
2
(b)
proviso,
a
situation
where
every
time
a
retail
store
cuts
the
price
on
one
item
of
branded
merchandize,
it
immediately
becomes
face
to
face
in
competition
with
the
manufacturer
of
other
--
another
brand
of
merchandize
which
--
with
which
that
brand
competes
is
to
open
up
an
unwarranted
exception
to
the
robinson-patman
act.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
an
argument
is
made
that
the
commission
did
have
that
understanding
and
i
don't
propose
to
dispute
it
here
today.
yes,
we
will
concede
that.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes
they
were
and
if
they
had
--
if
they
were
taking
that
position
today,
i
would
not
be
here
defending
it.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
of
course,
this
is
--
this
i
might
say
that
the
commission
was
or
congressional
committees
felt
that
the
statute
was
being
not
properly
and
--
not
enforced
at
all
during
the
period
and
i
may
say
it
was
not
too
long
a
period.
the
letters
which
are
attached
to
the
brief
of
the
amicus
of
texaco
indicate
that
it
was
about
a
year
from
the
middle
of
1954
to
the
middle
of
1955
when
the
commission
repeatedly
held
that
position.
prior,
i
may
say
also
that
prior
to
1951,
this
court's
decision
in
the
standard
oil
case,
the
problem
had
different
overtones
because
section
2
(b)
was
not
considered
to
be
an
absolute
defense
in
any
attempt
by
the
commission.
our
position
is
that
the
argument
of
the
respondent
and
texaco
as
friend
to
the
court
that
this
proviso
was
to
be
construed
broadly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
it
has
the
word
competitor
in
it,
and
therefore,
assumedly
reflects
the
general
purpose
of
promoting
competition,
does
violence
to
the
structure
of
the
statute
and
the
intention
of
congress.
texaco
indeed
speaks
of
giving
this
proviso
a
preferred
position
such
as
it
deserves
in
a
competitive
society.
that's
at
page
25
of
the
amicus
brief.
it
says
the
preferred
position
of
meeting
competition
over
uniform
price
treatment
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
on
page
29,
it
says,
“one
would
have
expected
the
commission
to
have
accorded
the
meeting
competition
defense,
the
preferred
position
that
it
deserves
in
a
competitive
society.”
we
submit,
you're
dealing
with
the
statute
which
requires
that
first
there
be
discrimination
in
price
among
com
--
customers.
second,
they
find
it
that
the
effect
of
that
discrimination
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
or
to
injure,
destroy,
or
prevent
competition.
and
in
the
find
--
in
the
face
of
those
findings
to
say
that
the
policy
of
free
enterprise
is
exclusively
promoted
as
is
argued
here
by
the
proviso
to
section
2
(b),
is
an
odd
way
to
construe
the
statute.
now,
it's
not
clear
entirely
as
i
now
turn
to
the
more
detailed
facts
of
the
case,
that
the
court
below
did
not
accept
our
construction
of
the
statute.
the
careful
reasoning
of
the
opinion
indicates
that
among
other
things
what
the
court
did
was
to
integrate
the
super
test
station
across
the
street
backward
and
at
the
same
time,
integrate
the
sun
station
forward.
it
said
that
sun
advertised
heavily
and
appeals
directly
to
the
consumer,
and
that
the
retail
gasoline
dealer
is
simply
a
conduit
for
delivering
gasoline
to
the
consumer,
that
is
a
rare
bird
among
merchants.
the
effort
in
this
approach
is
to
put
sun
and
super
test
on
the
same
horizontal
level
which
i
have
suggested
is
the
normal
way
to
read
the
statute.
we
think
that
the
dealer's
legal
independence
which
sun
saw
assiduously
creates
itself,
cannot
thus
easily
be
put
aside.
the
dealer
bears
the
risk
of
the
loss.
he
is
merely
a
tenant
in
the
sun
station
with
a
supply
contract.
sun
carefully
sets
it
up
that
way.
now
on
the
facts
of
this
presentation,
it
is
not
easy
to
see
how
we,
all
of
a
sudden,
in
a
situation
where
sun
claims
the
right
to
deal
unequally
with
its
tenants
in
the
stations
to
say
why
we're
going
to
ignore
this
independence
and
say
this
dealer
is
something
between
an
independent
contractor,
something
less
than
an
independent
contractor,
and
something
more
than
an
employee
as
the
court
below
did.
now
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
review
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
among
the
gasoline?
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
no,
it
does
not.
this
is
the
usual.
i
think
there
are
vastly
a
greater
number
of
stations
independent,
occupied
by
tenants
of
the
gasoline
companies
and
tied
to
them
in
one
form
or
another
by
supply
contracts.
they
rent
the
pumps.
they
rent
the
stations
and
the
stations
are
painted
in
the
colors
of
the
gasoline
supplier.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
it
does
not.
although
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
i
do
not
know
where
the
court
of
appeals
got
that
conclusion.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
there
was
no
issue
created
on
this
subject.
the
sun
company
offered
no
evidence
whatsoever
as
to
the
character
of
the
sun
company,
i
mean
of
the
super
test
company
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
--
or
the
nature
of
that
operation.
the
fact
that
super
test
owns
65
retail
stations,
came
in,
in
the
course
of
interrogation
of
a
ms.
goodwin
who
was
the
office
manager
of
super
test,
who
was
asked
to
supply
certain
records
as
to
the
gallonage.
she
testified
she
had
10
office
employees
under
her
and
she
received
the
reports
of
65
stations.
other
than
that,
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
what
super
test
character
really
is
and
this
was
not,
if
i
may
say
it,
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
a
defense
of
the
sun
oil
company
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
i
think
we
might
have
a
case
against
texaco
because
this
might
arise
very
well
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes,
your
honor,
because
this
presumes
a
situation
in
which
the
texaco
dealer
across
the
street
may
very
well
be
--
have
been
given
special
arrangements
by
the
texaco
company.
i'll
say
this,
if
texaco
had
cut
the
tank
wagon
price
in
the
whole
area,
it
will
be
quite
unlikely
for
sun
to
respond
by
cutting
the
price
at
one
of
its
stations.
it
would
be
more
likely
to
respond
by
cutting
the
tank
wagon
put
--
its
own
tank
wagon
price.
and
if
texaco
cut
the
price
to
the
one
station,
it
would
immediately
become
subject
to
this
provision
of
the
act
and
it
might
also
become
subject
to
the
sherman
act
for
having
engaged
in
predatory
practices.
and
this
has
something
to
do
with
the
facts
of
this
case
as
i
want
to
--
would
like
to
present
at
this
point.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes
we
would.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
the
mclean
station
opened
at
the
end
of
february
1955.
it
was
one
of
eight
stations
in
the
territory
of
the
--
as
setup
by
the
sun
company.
there
were
six
other
sun
stations
fairly
close
to
it
and
there
were
three
sun
territories
in
duval
county
which
is
the
jacksonville
area.
in
all,
there
were
38
stations
in
the
jacksonville
area.
super
test
opened
in
june
as
compared
to
mclean
opening
in
february.
it
was
diagonally
across
the
street
from
it.
it
was
one
of
a
chain
of
65
stations.
it
sold
regularly
at
a
price
two
cents
below
the
price
of
the
major
gasoline
as
for
instance
the
sun
product.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
oh
no.
that's
right,
below
all
the
major
prices
then
common
in
the
area.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
in
response
--
yes,
subsequently.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
sun
was
the
only
major
supplier
which
cut
its
price
in
the
entire
six-week
period
of
price
warfare
to
which
--
which
followed
the
initial
sun
cut
price
to
mclean.
i'm
jumping
ahead
now
to
another
period,
but
the
other
sun
--
the
other
major
stations
in
that
area
did
not
move
their
price.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
to
just
one
of
their
dealers
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
to
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes
an
across
the
board
tank
wagon
price
cut
to
all
the
dealers
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
--
there
would
be
no
violation
of
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
assuming
that
sun
cuts
its
price
to
all
of
its
dealers,
there
would
be
no
violation
in
sun's
action.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
if
in
the
next
county,
there
might
be
some
peripheral
effect
on
some
dealers
right
at
the
edge
of
the
area
if
that's
your
honor's
question.
and
that
might
raise
a
question
under
the
robinson-patman
act
but
the
trade
commission
under
its
1948
policy
recognizes
that
there
may
be
some
peripheral
effect
on
competition
resulting
from
a
fair
effort
to
cut
a
price
in
an
area.
now
this
effort,
i
may
say
ought
to
be
an
effort
subject
to
reexamination
that
as
the
events
wear
on,
workout,
the
company
ought
to
be
required
to
reappraise
the
situation,
to
see
whether
the
price
that
they'd
tried
to
give
fairly
to
all
its
dealers
is
working
out
that
way.
i'm
not
sure
if
i
answered
your
question.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
i'm
afraid
i
just
don't
follow
your
honor's
question.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
i
think
clearly
not.
i
mean,
i
--
it
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes.
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that's
correct.
now
in
a
recent
pure
oil
ruling,
a
ruling
of
pure
oil
proceeding
involving
another
type
of
violation,
a
primary
line
violation,
the
examiner
observed
that
there
were
something
like
500
different
tank
wagon
prices
and
that's
generally
what
you
call
i
think
a
county
price,
a
tank
wagon
price.
there
were
some
500
different
tank
wagon
prices
being
maintained
by
pure
in
the
20
odd
states
in
which
it
operates
and
that
these
were
not
alike
except
coincidentally.
the
robinson-patman
act
does
not
require
price
uniformity
in
all
areas
of
the
country.
in
this
aspect,
what
is
required
is
that
the
seller
make
a
bona
fide
effort
to
not
discriminate
among
its
various
dealers
when
it
gives
a
price
cut
to
make
an
effort
to
see
to
it
that
this
price
it
gives
a
dealer,
five
dealers,
10
dealers
does
not
cause
substantial
injury
to
surrounding
dealers.
and
then
we
submit
to
reappraise
that
situation
in
the
face
perhaps
of
complaints
from
neighboring
dealers
that
they
didn't
get
a
fair
break,
and
that
they
are
perhaps
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
of
the
same
company.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
no,
i'm
--
i'm
dealing
only
with
the
dealers
of
one
company
because
this
is
the
issue
in
this
type
of
proceeding.
i'm
not
certain
i
have
answered
your
question
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
undoubtedly,
there
is
no
question
but
what
it
raises
a
problem.
in
this
case,
the
sun
oil
company
cut
the
price
to
one
dealer.
other
dealers
complained
within
a
nearby
area.
the
examiner
found
they
were
on
a
common
traffic
pattern
leading
from
north
or
northwest
jacksonville
into
downtown
jacksonville
from
a
residential
area.
that
they
could
travel
alternative
routes
and
that
customers
wide
--
were
diverted
from
the
sun
dealers
located
nearby
to
mclean
station.
the
examiner
found
that
this
caused
the
nearby
sun
dealers
substantial
injury
and
i
may
say
that
one
of
them,
the
examiner
found,
dropped
from
10,900
gallons
in
december
which
was
before
the
price
war
to
9300
in
january.
that's
a
drop
of
about
1600
gallons
or
about
15%.
the
examiner
found
that
another
dealer
dropped
from
an
average
of
17,000
or
18,000
gallons
a
month
to
14,500
in
january
during
the
price
war.
in
other
words,
from
2500
to
3500
gallons
lost
or
15%
to
25%
plus
car
washes,
plus
tires,
batteries,
and
accessories
which
might
have
been
sold,
incidental
repairs,
those
are
lost
customers
to
those
dealers.
that's
a
loss
of
the
total
profit
on
those
sales.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
it
might
have
been,
but
it
wasn't.
oh,
you
mean
during
this
period,
you
mean
during
the
price
war
period?
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes.
some
of
that
probably
was
to
super
test,
but
i
may
say
that
when
--
the
way
the
price
war
came
about,
super
test
on
the
27th
of
december
cut
its
price
to
24
and
ninth
tenths
cents
a
gallon.
mclean
had
been
selling
at
28
and
nine
tenths
cents
a
gallon.
when
he
got
an
allowance
from
the
sun
oil
company
of
one
and
seven
tenths
cents
a
gallon,
he
cut
his
price
3
cents.
he
hadn't
cut
it
all
at
that
point,
but
when
he
got
this
allowance,
he
cut
it
3
cents.
that
put
him
within
1
cent
of
the
super
test
price.
now
super
test
generally
and
the
non-major
gasoline
generally
have
been
selling
in
a
2-cent
differential.
so
super
test
dropped
another
penny.
when
that
happened,
it
was
super
test
and
the
sun
stations
selling
well
below
the
regular
price.
and
moreover,
a
royal
arrow
station
or
red
arrow
station,
next
door
also
dropped
to
the
super
test
price,
another
non-major,
it
dropped
an
additional
penny.
so
that,
here
was
all
of
this
gallonage
flooding
into
this
corner,
now
some
of
it
was
undoubtedly
going
to
these
non-majors
because
the
price
gap
at
that
--
the
greater
the
price
gap,
the
more
likelihood
there
is
that
some
customers
who
would
otherwise
buy
major
gasoline
will
buy
this
gasoline.
but
the
point
is
that
the
sun
oil
company
was
financing
this
price
war,
we
submit,
out
of
the
pockets
of
the
surrounding
retail
gasoline
dealers
and
in
this
case
out
of
its
own
gasoline
dealer's
pockets
because
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
i
can't
tell.
i
--
it
might
--
it
might
be
that
this
kind
of
a
price
cut
would
be
required
in
order
to
assure
that
whatever
price
war
eventuates
is
being
borne
by
the
supplier
who
has
chosen
to
protect
its
share
of
the
market
as
the
lower
court
described
it,
by
cutting
its
price.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that's
right.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
it
happens
in
this
case
that
the
super
test
station,
apparently,
was
the
only
super
test
station
in
the
area,
but
let
me
say
this
about
that
super
test
pricing
operation.
the
lower
court
describes
it
as
being
predatory
in
two
or
three
occasions.
there
is
uncontradicted
testimony
in
the
record
by
the
vice
president
of
the
sun
oil
company
and
by
the
director
of
marketing
research
for
the
sun
oil
company,
that
what
super
test
was
doing
was
the
commonly
used
tactic
of
a
non-major
breaking
into
a
new
market,
getting
a
foothold
in
the
market,
building
up
the
gallonage
quickly.
let
me
read
just
briefly.
mr.
charles,
the
director
of
marketing
research,
“super
test
used
the
commonly
used
methods
of
more
rapidly
developing
volume
in
new
service
stations
that
is
used
by
such
outlets.
they
first
utilized
the
low
price.
they
lowered
the
normal
price
and
they
advertised
that
price
extensively.”
that's
on
page
232.
then
mr.
wright,
the
vice
president
in-charge
of
marketing,
on
page
222,
gives
his
understanding
of
what
causes
price
wars
and
he
lists
a
number
of
ways
in
which
price
wars
come
about
and
the
third
one
is
this
case.
he
says,
page
222,
“for
one
of
the
chains,
and
this
is
particularly
true
where
the
chain
builds
a
new
station,
the
change
man
--
chain's
management
may
decide
that
it
would
lower
the
price
at
that
particular
chain
in
order
to
get
that
station
off
to
a
good
start
and
build
a
high
gallonage
with
greater
rapidity
than
normal.
this
is
a
practice
that
is
rather
well
recognized
in
the
industry.”
now
here's
a
newcomer
coming
into
a
market,
opening
up
a
gasoline
station.
to
get
that
gasoline
station
of
to
a
start,
its
cut
the
price
--
cut
the
price
six
times
in
the
course
of
six
months,
first
the
grand
opening
sale
that
was
held
six
weeks
after
it
opened.
but
the
idea
is,
you
got
a
non-major
line
of
gasoline
and
want
people
to
try
that
gasoline,
you
induce
them
to
come
to
your
station
with
a
lower
price,
and
in
the
hope
that
they
will
like
it.
the
major
oil
companies
spend
--
sun
in
this
case,
spends
a
third
of
a
cent
a
gallon
in
advertising
its
product.
by
that
third
of
a
cent
of
gallon,
it
manages
to
maintain
for
its
one
price
gasoline,
at
this
time
it
had
only
one
rate,
a
margin
of
2
cents
over
the
non-major
brands.
it
induces
the
dealers
to
sell
sun
gasoline
because
it
promises
them
a
somewhat
protected
area
from
other
sun
dealers
and
it
promises
them
a
margin
of
two
cents
over
the
nonstandard
brands.
having
established
these
stations,
induce
them
to
come
in
and
take
over
the
operation
and
this
record
as
it
indicates,
there
is
a
$2000
deposit
involved
and
then
when
it
gets
involved
with
some
price
competition,
with
a
non-major
trying
to
break
into
the
market,
cuts
the
price
to
one
station
and
i
say
finances
a
large
portion
of
that
price
war
out
of
the
pockets
of
the
other
dealers
because
they
find
themselves
instead
of
having
a
two-cent
margin
over
non-major
gasoline,
they
suddenly
find
themselves
in
competition
with
other
stations,
selling
sun
gasoline
at
a
substantially
lower
price
here,
three
cents
lower.
burying
the
clang,
crabcree
and
winning,
four
sun
station
operators
who
testified
in
this
case,
found
themselves
during
this
period
that
they
were
in
business.
they
weren't
all
in
business
during
the
whole
period,
found
themselves
in
a
condition
where
they
were
competing
with
sun
gasoline
being
sold
at
3
cents
lower
than
they
were
selling
at.
and
we
said
--
i
said
this
--
this
was
a
means
of
financing
a
price
war
out
of
the
pockets
of
the
dealer
and
i'd
like
to
explain
how
this
works.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
absolutely
not.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
what
i
am
talking
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that's
correct
and
the
court
found
in
the
facts
which
have
been
suggested
by
questions,
the
problems
of
the
gasoline
marketing,
the
court
found
in
those
circumstances
a
reason
for
treating
the
sun
oil
company
as
though
it
were
in
direct
competition
with
the
super
test
station
across
the
street.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
i
would
say
not
and
that's
why
i
preceded
my
argument,
this
part
of
the
argument
by
discussing
how
you
construe
the
statute,
whether
you
look
for
this
purpose
of
promoting
competition
under
section
2
(a)
violation
which
requires
the
finding
that
there
be
a
tendency
to
monopolize
or
a
tendency
to
eliminate
competition
or
a
substantial
injury
to
competition.
and
that
you're
dealing
here
with
a
very
limited
proviso
so
that
you
--
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
court
should
take
all
of
the
facts
and
look
for
the
ultimate
solution
which
in
its
judgment
will
best
solve
the
problems
of
price
wars
in
the
gasoline
industry.
this
is
not
a
problem
susceptible
of
being
so
readily
solved
and
certainly
not
through
the
--
a
construction
to
be
given
the
robinson-patman
act
which
stands
for
some
general
principles
which
we
insist
should
be
adhered
to,
but
these
facts
which
the
lower
court
referred
to
put
an
equitable
gloss
on
the
case
which
the
sun
company
presents
and
i'm
going
into
them
just
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
just
what
is
the
impact
that
these
factors
which
the
court
discussed.
when
you
get
right
down
to
it,
after
you
have
discussed
the
fact
that
the
gasoline
station
is
subservient
to
the
sun
company
because
it's
tied
to
it
as
a
supplier,
the
station
is
painted
with
the
colors
of
the
sun
company,
that
it's
a
lessee
who
come
right
back
with
the
proposition
that
what
really
lends
some
color
to
the
court's
proposition
that
the
manufacturer
is
a
competitor
of
that
retailer
is
that
it's
a
brand
product.
the
argument
is
that
gasoline
like
other
products
has
a
direct
brand
appeal.
the
testimony
of
the
vice
president
of
marketing
of
the
sun
oil
company
at
page
210
of
the
record,
illustrates
this
point
and
i
may
say
that
it
also
illustrates
the
point
that
it's
a
brand
appeal
that
isn't
much
different
from
other
brand
appeal.
he
says,
“all
manufacturers
and
distributors
of
branded
products
have
been
emphasizing
the
superiority
of
their
brand.
they
do
the
[inaudible]
advertising.
they
emphasize
their
brand
through
the
type
of
package
they
use.
they
are
neat.
they
are
objective.
they
are
easy
to
handle.”
i
would
also
say
that
during
this
time,
all
consumers
were
buying
branded
packed
products
in
packages.
they
buy
coffee
in
packages.
they
buy
brands
of
cookies
in
packages
and
it
has
been
the
same
with
gasoline.
so
the
issue
is,
does
a
retailer
of
a
branded
product
who
finds
in
--
who
cuts
the
price
of
that
branded
product,
does
he
invite
a
situation
where
the
manufacturer
of
other
branded
products
automatically
and
instantaneously
becomes
his
competitor
and
he
finds
himself
facing
the
manufacturer
in
competition.
and
let
me
say
this,
“not
only
does
the
manufacturer
thereby
come
in
competition
with
the
retailer
by
this
process
under
this
construction,
but
he
has
the
right
to
pick
and
choose
which
of
the
retailers
he's
going
to
favor
in
this
way.
this
section
2
(b)
proviso
is
not
something
which
a
manufacturer
has
to
follow.
it's
something
which
he
has
the
option
to
follow
and
if
he
doesn't
like
the
situation
in
which
this
particular
retailer
is
demanding
a
pay
price
cut,
he
doesn't
have
to
give
it.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
i
would
say
that
he
should
apply
the
statute
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
discriminate
among
the
stations
to
their
competitive
injury.
now
that's
not
apparently
an
answer
to
the
question
but
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
let
me
say
this.
in
this
case,
to
heighten
the
question
a
little
more,
in
this
case,
the
evidence
is
that
before
sun
gave
the
price
cut
to
mclean,
none
of
these
dealers
were
damaged
at
all
by
super
test
competition.
so
here,
you
have
a
case
where
4
four
dealers,
zero,
zero,
zero
against
the
mclean
suffering
injury.
and
the
commission's
position
is
that
we
say
correctly
under
the
statute,
that
when
it
gives
a
price
cut,
it
has
to
give
that
price
cut
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
create
injury
to
those
four
who
had
previously
been
zero,
zero,
zero,
zero.
and
if
it
turns
out
upon
later
appraisal,
if
it
makes
its
first
best
effort
to
select
a
fair
across
the
board
price
cut
or
persons
to
whom
they
give
it,
that
in
fact
those
persons
begin
to
suffer
injury.
it
has
to
make
or
create
accommodation.
this
is
the
commission's
position
on
the
construction
with
respect
to
this
problem.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
the
--
one
might
hypothesize
that
that
would
be
the
situation
except
that
as
i
said
in
the
pure
oil
case,
the
examiner
refers
to
the
fact
that
there
are
some
500
different
tank
wagon
prices
that
being
the
price
at
which
major
--
the
pure
oil
company
was
selling
its
retail
dealers
in
various
portions
of
the
country
and
none
of
them
were
alike
except
coincidentally.
the
majors
are
quite
accustomed
to
having
different
tank
wagon
prices
in
different
parts
of
the
country,
in
different
counties,
in
different
cities
accommodating
to
local
conditions
and
no
--
nothing
improbable
or
impossible
about
there
being
as
different
prices.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
the
direct
answer
is
that
it
ought
to
make
a
reduction
to
at
least
those
stations,
but
it
might
be
required
to
make
a
reduction
to
more
stations.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
it
ought
to
give
price
cuts
to
at
least
to
those
five
equally
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
--
or
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
cause
injury
from
the
price
cuts
which
it
gives.
in
other
words,
it
could
be
--
it
possibly
could
feather
out
the
price
cut
and
some
gasoline
stations
--
companies
do
this.
it
could
give
the
–
a
one
price
cut
to
two
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
to
two
and
the
other
to
three
or
the
others,
or
it
could
give
it
to
four
into
one.
the
issue
would
be
not
what
the
prior
harm
had
they
suffered
from
super
test
but
what
future
harm
might
be
anticipated
from
the
special
price
cut
that
the
sun
was
giving.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes,
i
am
leaving
out
the
primary
line
of
the
problem
and
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that's
correct
and
there
are
no
charges
of
the
violation
of
the
primary
line.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes.
and
so
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
i
answer
the
question
in
terms
of
our
construction,
how
you
would
carry
out
this
application
of
the
statute,
what
would
be
the
practical
impact
of
it?
my
argument
as
to
whether
or
not
2
(b)
applies
is
that
you
meet
the
statute
in
its
normal
construction
that
there's
no
occasion
on
the
facts
of
this
case
to
read
it
in
the
other
way
and
there's
no
occasion
on
the
history
of
the
legislation
to
read
it
any
other
way.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
this
is
the
essence
of
my
argument
on
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
right,
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
the
reason
there's
no
issue
as
to
the
injury
of
the
competition
is
that
there
is
an
undisputed
finding
that
there
is
a
--
there
was
an
injury
on
the
secondary
line
basis
to
competition.
this
is
--
this
is
conceded
in
the
--
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
refer
one
more
time
to
this
price
war
and
the
four
months
that
super
test
was
presumably
oppressing
mclean
before
the
price
cut
was
given
by
the
sun
oil
company.
the
record
shows
that
super
test
cut
the
price
on
the
27th
and
28th
of
august
and
it
did
not
cut
the
price
thereafter
until
the
3rd,
i'm
sorry
the
4th
of
december,
the
4th,
the
12th,
13th,
and
14th,
and
27th
of
december.
on
the
27th
of
december,
sun
responded
with
a
price
cuts
to
mclean.
so
there
was
a
four-month
period
there
when
no
deep
price
cuts
were
made
by
super
test
during
that
period.
the
court
will
resort
that
--
will
refer
to
the
table
at
page
354,
will
find
that
mclean
continued
to
lose
gallonage.
now,
reference
has
been
made
to
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
this
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
this,
if
your
honor
please,
refutes
the
notion
that
mclean
was
being
oppressed
by
super
test.
the
oppression
is
alleged
to
come
from
the
deep
price
cuts
which
it
has
said
were
repeatedly
made
and
which
repeatedly
caused
mclean
to
complain
to
the
sun
company.
but
actually,
the
price
cuts
were
made
in
august,
late
in
august
after
super
test
had
been
in
business
for
at
least
six
weeks.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
if
your
honor
please,
it
appears
to
me
that
this
is
a
kind
of
signal
price
warfare.
this
is
the
way
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
signal
price
warfare.
this
is
a
way
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
signal.
this
is
a
way
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
--
in
which
the
sun
oil
company
tells
the
super
test
company,
“hold
off
on
these
price
cuts
or
we
will
cut
the
price
so
close
to
your
price
that
you
will
have
to
come
down
and
as
happened
here,
you
will
be
selling
61,000
gallons
of
gasoline
at
a
substantially
lower
price
than
you
had
previously
been
selling
it.
now,
i
said
it
was
a
signal
and
i
say
it's
a
signal
in
this
sense.
the
other
major
oil
companies
standby
and
do
not
respond
when
this
happens.
now
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
six
weeks
later
after
this
price
war
had
gone
on
for
six
weeks
out
of
what
i
say
is
the
profits
of
the
other
sun
dealers
and
other
independent,
the
other
major
dealers
in
fact.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that
--
there
was
a
finding
that
the
purpose
of
sun
oil
was
to
go
below
the
price
of
super
test
as
normally
maintained
and
that
this
refuted
the
good
faith
defense.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
this
finding
and
it
is
not
here
for
review.
we
did
not
petition
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
--
for
certiorari
on
this
your
honor.
