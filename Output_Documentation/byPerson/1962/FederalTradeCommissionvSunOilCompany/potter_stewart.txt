this
is
a
--
this
is
a
peculiar
kind
of
a
business.
it's
certainly
not
like
a
jewelry
store
which
sells
a
variety
of
brands
of
watches
and
many
other
items
manufactured
by
many
manufacturers
and
sold
by
--
probably
by
many
wholesalers.
this
is
a
--
this
automobile
--
i
mean
these
service
stations,
gas
stations
although
setup
as
independent
entrepreneurs
sell
one
product
and
have
no
choice,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
that
it's
unique
but
it's
certainly
quite
different,
quite
different
from
the
ordinary
jewelry
store
or
dry
good
store
or
department
store.
justice
potter
stewart
but
those
--
that
is
the
fact,
that
those
are
the
facts
of
life
generally,
they
do
carry
the
products
of
only
one
manufacturer,
do
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
--
i
suppose
a
fortiori,
it's
quite
clear
that
had
this
price
reduction
not
been
granted,
mclean
would've
gone
out
of
business
very
quickly?
justice
potter
stewart
small
businessmen
who
have
just
been
destroyed
very
quickly.
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
what
the
setup
was
over
--
across
the
street
at
super
test?
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
it
as
an
integrated
operation
i
think
or
didn't
come
around
the
state
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
super
test
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
if
instead
of
the
super
test
across
the
street,
it
had
been
texaco
and
the
evidence
was
that
it
was
--
the
hearing
to
show
that
texaco's
setup
was
exactly
the
way
the
sun
oil
did
with
controlled,
theoretical,
independent
contractors
but
people
who
are
very
much
under
the
control
of
the
supplier,
would
you
have
the
same
case
as
you
have
now?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
regardless
of
what
texaco
might
or
might
not
be
guilty
of,
if
sun
--
if
everything
were
the
same
except
to
what
i've
said
that
this
is
a
texaco
station
and
not
a
super
test
one
and
it
was
shown
that
texaco
marketed
its
products
the
way
sun
does
here.
if
sun
had
cut
its
tank
wagon
price
to
this
to
mclean
station
in
order
to
meet
that
competition,
would
you
have
the
same
case
as
you
have
now?
justice
potter
stewart
you
would?
justice
potter
stewart
the
loss
might
have
been
to
super
test.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
the
automobile
being
what
it
is,
i
don't
see
that
this
would
stop
anywhere
short
of
a
nationwide
reduction.
justice
potter
stewart
what
you've
address
yourself
so
far
to
as
i
understand
it
is
that
only
by
doing
what
you
said
sun
would
have
to
do,
could
it
avoid
a
violation
that
is
from
the
point
of
view
of
injuring
competition.
you've
just
assumed
in
all
of
this
argument
that
the
proviso,
2
(b)
isn't
available
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
haven't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
--
but
that's
the
real
issue
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
if
you
--
is
that
your
whole
argument
on
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
because
i'd
understood
that
that
was
the
sole
issue
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
no
question
about
the
injury
of
the
competition
here.
the
sole
issue
is
the
availability
of
the
proviso
to
be
as
a
defense?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
super
test
is
the
supplier
and
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
who
that
was.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
mean
--
you
mean
super
test
the
supplier
rather
than
super
test
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
clearly
is
within
the
literal
words
of
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
the
question
before
it
sued.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
only
question,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
availability
of
the
--
this
proviso
as
a
defense
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
case
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
trade
commission.
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
american
oil
company.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
on
your
brief?
justice

stewart
page

justice
potter
stewart
would
affect
a
little
bit
the
eloquence
of
your
argument
because
you
couldn't
talk
about
this
big
giant.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
was
this
--
is
this
good
or
bad
from
your
point
of
view,
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
should
sun
have
cut
--
done
these
four
months
earlier
from
your
point
of
view?
justice

single
or
signal?
