mr.
john
j.
lally
mr.
--
may
it
--
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1959,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
bearing
in
mind
the
decision
of
this
court
in
griffin
versus
illinois
and
in
eskridge
versus
the
board
of
prison
terms
and
paroles
for
the
state
of
washington
came
out
with
this
decision
which
my
brother
counsel
has
referred
to,
which
is
in
re
woods
versus
rhay
appearing
in
54
washington
2d,
page
36.
and
in
it,
our
supreme
court
was
trying
to
do
two
things;
one
is
to
set
up
a
procedure
for
the
providing
of
free
transcripts
to
indigents
that
would
comply
with
the
standards
this
court
set
out
in
the
griffin
and
eskridge
cases.
and
two,
to
provide
a
means
within
constitutional
standards
that
would
eliminate
the
granting
of
free
transcripts
if
the
request
was
a
frivolous
one.
members
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
just
add
this
in
reference
to
what
counsel
has
stated
on
this
formula
that
appears
in
that
case.
the
formula
goes
on
and
then
states
this,
after
the
trial
judge
has
done
these
indicated
items
that
counsel
mentioned,
a
stenographic
court
recorder's
report
of
that
hearing
should
have
been
made,
must
be
made,
that
shall
be
forwarded
to
our
supreme
court
if
the
indigent
defendant
is
not
satisfied
because
the
trial
court
did.
in
this
particular
case
which
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
of
the
hearing
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
on
the
application.
mr.
john
j.
lally
not
of
the
trial.
now,
this
case
and
what
happened
in
it,
i
think
typically
exemplifies
how
our
trial
courts
work
under
this
formula.
in
this
case,
the
indigent
was
not
satisfied
when
he
was
turned
down,
his
application
for
the
free
transcript
of
the
robbery
trial
itself.
so,
the
rule
provides
that
if
the
man
is
represented
by
counsel
who
was
appointed,
which
was
the
situation
in
this
case,
that
counsel
shall
be
retained
and
continue
to
represent
that
indigent
man
throughout
this
process.
it
provides
in
this
case
--
pardon
me,
what
happened
then
in
this
case,
the
stenographic
report
of
the
hearing
held
before
the
trial
judge
for
the
free
statement
of
facts
or
transcript
was
forwarded
to
our
supreme
court.
the
affidavit
and
motion
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
where
they
asked
for
the
free
transcript
was
forwarded
into
our
supreme
court,
a
lengthy
affidavit,
counter
affidavit,
pardon
me,
filed
by
the
deputy
prosecuting
attorney
who
tried
this
case
in
which
appears
beginning
on
page
19
of
the
record
before
this
court
was
sent
to
our
supreme
court.
and
in
that
respect,
members
of
the
court,
there
is
no
question
raised
by
the
petitioners
to
what
the
facts
set
out
in
the
johnson
counter
affidavit
are
true.
and
they
summarized
in
essence
in
a
narrative
form,
all
the
testimony
that
occurred
at
the
robbery
trial.
mr.
john
j.
lally
that
appears
on
page
9
--
(inaudible)
i
believe
its
on
page
19,
it
begins
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
--
of
the
record
before
this
court.
in
addition
to
that,
of
course,
there
were
submitted
to
our
court,
the
briefs
of
counsel
and
the
oral
argument
of
counsel
which
occurred.
a
transcription
of
the
oral
argument
that
heard
--
that
was
heard
before
the
trial
judge
and
then
further
oral
argument
heard
before
our
appellate
court.
that
in
essence
is
the
procedure
which
this
formula
calls
for.
now,
as
counsel
pointed
out,
there
were
two
items
under
this
formula
which
were
not
followed
by
the
trial
judge.
and
it
wasn't
an
omission
by
accident
but
it
occurred
unsatisfied
without
accident.
it
was
the
state's
physician
in
this
case
that
there
hadn't
been
anything
raised
--
there
hadn't
been
anything
raised
by
the
petitioners
which
required
any
kind
of
a
transcript
or
statement
of
facts
from
the
trial
itself.
mr.
john
j.
lally
that's
right
and
i
believe
i
can
show
mr.
justice
white
in
a
moment
that
our
supreme
court
from
the
record
that
was
before
us
was
able
to
answer
every
single
contention
that
was
raised.
mr.
john
j.
lally
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
lally
i
think
it
can.
i
think
it
can
and
i'll
state
why.in
this
situation
--
i
better
back
up
on
this.
under
the
rules
of
evidence
in
effect
in
washington,
our
supreme
court
will
review
nothing
that
has
not
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
in
other
words,
a
nonindigent
who
forwards
to
our
supreme
court
a
full
statement
of
facts
that
may
have
10
errors
in
it,
if
there
was
no
record
made
before
the
trial
court
at
the
time
the
error
occurred,
our
supreme
court
will
not
reverse.
mr.
john
j.
lally
if
there
was
no
objection
made
and
on
the
proper
ground.
mr.
john
j.
lally
our
supreme
court
will
not
reverse.
mr.
john
j.
lally
because
if
--
what
happened
in
this
case,
and
it
shows
up
on
--
beginning
on
page
77
of
this
trial
record
is
the
opinion
of
our
supreme
court
that
this
matter
it
was
decided
by
our
supreme
court
under
the
title
of
state
versus
law.
now
in
that
for
example,
here's
what
happened.
just
for
illustration,
i
try
to
boil
it
down.
under
contention
for
illustration
number
six,
the
petitioners
here
alleged
13
grounds
of
error.
in
actual
fact,
there
are
12,
but
the
13th
was
the
request
for
the
free
transcript.
on
number
six,
for
example,
was
this
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
that
appears,
mr.
justice
black,
on
page
12
of
the
record.
number
six
for
illustration
is
that
the
trial
judge
was
prejudiced
against
the
defendant
throughout
the
entire
trial.
now
with
reference
to
that,
in
its
findings
of
fact,
the
trial
judge
denied
that,
but
the
important
fact
is
this
and
here's
how
our
supreme
court
could
answer
it.
even
and
--
though
the
answer
would
have
been
identically
the
same
and
had
there
been
a
full
statement
of
fact
of
the
robbery
trial
itself.
our
supreme
court
said
this
and
it
appears
in
the
opinion
which
begins
on
page
77.
in
assign
--
“in
assignment
number
six,
the
defendant
states
that
the
trial
judge
was
prejudiced
against
them
throughout
the
trial.”
mr.
john
j.
lally
the
judge
denies
this
allegation,
under
our
rules
of
pleading,
practice
and
procedure
of
the
right
to
disqualify
a
trial
judge
because
of
prejudice
must
be
by
affidavit,
made
prior
to
the
judges
entering
upon
the
trial
of
the
matters,
citing
the
statute.
mr.
john
j.
lally
the
seventh
assignment?
mr.
john
j.
lally
very
well.
the
seventh
assignment
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
the
seventh
assignment
alleged
where
that
the
trial
judge
should
have
dismissed
the
case
as
the
defendants
are
not
guilty
as
charged.
you'll
recall,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
in
the
record
on
page
1920
and
1921
appears
the
uncontradicted
affidavit
of
johnson,
the
trial
deputy
prosecutor
who
summarized
all
the
evidence.
and
there's
no
question
raised
that
the
evidence
he
sets
out
in
his
affidavit
is
not
correct.
the
trial
judge
then
in
his
findings
of
fact,
which
appear
on
--
in
the
record
on
24,
25,
26
and
27
found
similarly
the
facts
to
be
as
they
appeared
in
the
uncontradicted
affidavit
of
johnson.
our
supreme
court
then,
in
dealing
with
seven,
said
this.
and
it
appears
in
the
58
washington
2d
on
pages
833
and
834,
“in
the
seventh
assignment
of
error,
the
defendant
state
that
the
judge
should
have
dismissed
the
case
because
they
are
not
guilty.
we
will
assume
without
deciding
that
this
assignment
raises
the
question
of
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
a
conviction.
the
evidence
outlined
above
which
the
jury
was
entitled
to
believe
was
sufficient
proof
in
support
of
the
convictions.”
mr.
john
j.
lally
by
--
in
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
trial
judge
and
the
uncontradicted
affidavit
of
johnson
which
summarized
the
evidence
given
with
reference
to
the
robbery.
mr.
john
j.
lally
in
this
particular
case
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
they
found,
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
in
this
case
it
is
our
position,
mr.
justice
white
that
the
supreme
court
of
washington
was
able
to
review
this
in
the
same
manner
as
if
they
have
had
a
statement
of
stenographic
report
of
the
trial.
mr.
john
j.
lally
i
think
we
can
state
that
the
result
would
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
(inaudible)
be
either
way.
mr.
john
j.
lally
number
eight?
mr.
john
j.
lally
well
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
with
reference
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
well,
here
is
how
our
supreme
court
handled
number
eight,
mr.
justice.
number
eight
was
the
exhibits
rendered
over
objection
that
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
be
entered
and
shouldn't
but
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
be
entered.
our
supreme
court
stated
on
page
835
of
the
volume
58,
washington
2d,
in
assignment
of
errors
number
eight
and
nine
--
nine,
of
course,
is
the
one
the
testimony
with
a
lot
of
our
objections
and
should
have
not
been
allowed.
in
assignments
of
errors
eight
and
nine,
it
is
alleged
that
exhibits
which
should
have
been
excluded
were
admitted
over
objection.
and
testimony
was
improperly
allowed
in
spite
of
objections,
thereto
manifestly,
these
allegations
are
too
broad
and
indefinite
to
indicate
what
specific
erroneous
rulings
of
the
court
the
defendants
had
in
mind
and
they
have
not
been
made
more
definite
by
the
briefs
before
this
court.
mr.
john
j.
lally
well,
in
this
particular
case
--
in
the
first
place,
the
lawyer
who
handled
all
of
it
was
selected
by
the
indigents
and
then
paid
compensated
by
the
state.
he
represented
them
at
the
trial
itself
that
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
at
the
hearing
for
the
free
statement
of
facts
and
in
the
supreme
court
that
he
was
familiar
with
the
case
from
the
beginning.
mr.
john
j.
lally
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
lally
that
is
certainly
correct.
in
other
words
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
one
is
what,
sir?
mr.
john
j.
lally
i
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
i
certainly
would
agree
that
this
method
of
review
in
many
instances,
our
court
could
not
review
by
this
method
in
many
cases
but
--
and
if
they
applied
the
formula
wrong
and
of
course,
that
there
would
be
difficulties.
and
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
incumbent
that
the
free
statement
of
stenographic
facts
of
the
trial
certainly
be
granted
in
many
instances.
and
it's
only
our
position
that
in
this
case
for
example,
they
applied
it
properly
and
a
review
was
possible
by
certiorari
which
this
method
has
occurred,
which
in
substance
resulted
in
the
same
and
as
had
it
been
reviewed
by
appeal.
mr.
john
j.
lally
well
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
not
solely,
not
solely.
you
see
before
the
supreme
court
or
the
stenographic
reports
of
the
full
argument
that
happened
at
the
hearing,
at
which
time
the
petitioner
draper
got
up
and
told
the
judge
all
the
things
he
had
on
his
mind.
and
they
appeared
therein,
all
the
argument
of
his
counsel
that
was
given
at
the
time
for
that
hearing
were
there
and
the
pleadings
itself
were
forwarded
to
our
supreme
court
at
the
time
of
review
on
certiorari.
mr.
john
j.
lally
no,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
lally
that's
right,
sir.
however,
for
illustration,
this
trial
is
in
the
record
reflects
was
a
three
day
trial.
the
record
reflects
an
experienced
criminal
lawyer
represented
the
petitioners
and
--
well,
this
is
not
mentioned
in
the
record.
i
think
we
may
reasonably
assume
if
any
errors
that
occurred
during
the
trial
to
which
he
objected
and
made
a
record
which
could
be
reviewed
by
our
appellate
court,
he
was
certainly
aware
of
it.
mr.
john
j.
lally
i
sort
of
think
it
is,
mr.
justice
black.
in
other
words,
i
would
agree
in
this
situation
if
the
facts
were
in
dispute.
we
would
very
like
to
have
a
different
problem.
in
other
words
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
yes.
if
the
facts
were
in
dispute,
i
think
our
appellate
court
would
have
a
very
difficult
time
to
try
and
review
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
i
think
our
court
would
have
to
grant
a
free
transcript
if
the
facts
had
been
in
dispute.
mr.
john
j.
lally
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
lally
well,
i'm
not
too
sure,
mr.
justice
black.
i
know
what
exactly
you
have
in
mind
by
bill
of
exceptions.
mr.
john
j.
lally
oh
well
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
in
wash
--
in
the
state
of
washington,
a
review
by
our
appellate
court
had
happened
and
occurred
either
in
some
instances
without
any
statement
of
facts
at
all
if
it's
a
legal
question
applying
to
the
pleadings.
it
can
occur
by
an
agreed
statement
of
facts
upon
which
counsel
agree
upon.
it
can
occur
by
a
full
stenographic
report
of
the
entire
trial
being
forwarded
to
our
appellate
court,
or
it
can
occur
by
a
portion
of
the
entire
record
being
sent
to
our
appellate
court
or
by
our
court
recorder
certified
by
our
judge
if
the
question
is
restricted
for
example
just
to
a
portion
of
the
record
itself.
mr.
john
j.
lally
oh
no
--
oh
--
no,
mr.
justice
black,
no,
(inaudible).
mr.
john
j.
lally
if
this
had
gone
to
our
appellate
court
by
a
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
--
by
a
full
transcript.
the
appellate
court
presumably
would
have
read
the
transcripts
through
and
it
is
our
position
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
black,
that
after
reading
it
through,
they
would
have
come
up
with
the
same
answers
they
came
up
to
as
set
out
in
their
decision
beginning
on
page
77
with
relation
to
every
point
that
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
oh
no,
there
would
be
argument
just
as
there
was.
there
was
argument,
of
course,
in
this
instance
going
up
this
way.
see,
in
the
first
place
of
the
12
grounds
that
this
petitioner
alleged,
in
seven
of
them,
there
had
been,
the
record
shows
that
seven
of
them,
there
had
been
no
objection
made
at
any
time
during
the
trial.
so,
under
the
procedure
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
that
appears
from
the
findings
of
fact
that
the
trial
judge
made
and
it's
not
contested
the
factual
correctness
of
the
trial
judge
findings
of
fact.
no
one
contends
there
an
error
factually.
mr.
john
j.
lally
well
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
the
issues
were
before
him
at
that
time
was
mr.
draper,
this
petitioner
and
his
codefendant,
mr.
lorentzen
and
their
counsel.
and
mr.
draper
wanted
to
address
the
court
himself
in
depth,
so
the
judge
as
it
appears
in
this
record
here
went
down
with
mr.
draper,
these
12
points
that
he
raised.
mr.
john
j.
lally
he
said
--
in
court
at
the
time
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
the
issue
at
that
time
was
whether
or
not
a
free
transcript
of
the
robbery
trial
which
had
already
occurred
would
be
granted
or
if
in
fact
the
request
was
frivolous
and
should
be
denied.
mr.
john
j.
lally
he
passes
first
and
automatically
this
formula
provides
if
the
indigent
is
not
satisfied,
it
must
be
reviewed
by
certiorari
by
our
appellate
court.
mr.
john
j.
lally
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
lally
yes.
as
a
matter
fact,
the
trial
judge
had
quite
a
time.
one
of
the
contentions
was
in
point
number
--
one
of
the
points
here
was
that
in
the
trial
itself,
the
exclusionary
witness
rule
had
been
invoked.
and
the
trial
judge
said,
as
you
would
see
in
this
record
here,
he
said
to
the
petitioner,
mr.
draper,
he
said,
“i
recall
no
witnesses
being
in
this
courtroom
after
i
invoked
the
rule.”
and
mr.
draper
said,
“well,
there
were
two.”
and
the
judge
said,
“well,
what
evidence
do
you
have
at
this?”
mr.
draper
said,
“i
have
witnesses.”
the
trial
judge
said,
“who
are
the
witnesses?”
mr.
draper
said,
“i
don't
have
to
tell
you
and
i
won't
tell
you
who
my
witnesses
are
to
that
fact.”
now
--
and
that
went
a
little
farther
in
the
conversation
and
the
conversation
went
on
most
to
the
points
but
that
was
the
way
the
trial
judge
--
a
part
of
the
hearing
covered
that
as
he
went
down
each
point
was
mr.
draper
who
wanted
to
speak
in
addition
to
having
his
counsel
speak.
mr.
john
j.
lally
i'm
sorry,
i
have
a
cold,
and
little
hard
of
hearing.
mr.
john
j.
lally
there
is.
the
formula
itself
states,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
anyone
who
is
not
satisfied
and
the
indigent
who
is
not
satisfied
of
what
the
trial
judge
does
has
an
automatic
right
on
certiorari
and
without
cost
and
with
counsel
to
have
it
reviewed
by
our
appellate
court.
mr.
john
j.
lally
yes,
mr.
justice
white
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
in
fact
in
this
case,
the
same
counsel
functioned
throughout
the
entire
proceeding
and
that's
our
general
practice.
mr.
john
j.
lally
it
is
obliged
to
hear
it
because
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
it
is
obliged
to
hear
it.
mr.
john
j.
lally
he
is
obliged
to
hear
it.
mr.
john
j.
lally
yes.
mr.
john
j.
lally
yes.
mr.
john
j.
lally
the
issue
is
--
mr.
john
j.
lally
yes.
it
just
happened,
sir,
that
in
this
case,
the
trial
judge
--
pardon
me,
our
appellate
court
was
able
to
review
the
thing
as
it
did
and
hit
every
single
point.
and
i
would
concede
if
it
hadn't
been
able
to
do
that,
it
is
better
to
take
the
position
that
the
indigent
had
better
be
given
a
free
statement
of
facts.
and
i
think
our
court
is
well
aware
of
this
court's
views
because
eskridge
came
from
spokane.
thank
you.
