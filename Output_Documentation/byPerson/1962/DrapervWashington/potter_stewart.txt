justice
potter
stewart
now
he
--
it
certainly
gives
the
indigent
a
lot
more
than
the
federal
statute
gives
in
section
1915
of
title
28
of
united
states
code,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'd
read
it
to
you.
justice
potter
stewart
it
simply
says
with
the
statutory
language,
“an
appeal
--”
this
is
part
of
1915
(a)
--
only
a
part
of
--
“an
appeal
may
not
be
taken
in
forma
pauperis
if
the
trial
court
certifies
in
writing
that
it
has
not
taken
in
good
faith
and
there's
no
requirement
for
a
hearing
or
finding
or
for
representation
by
counsel
before
the
trial
court.”
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
that.
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course
there
is
(inaudible)
in
the
other
cases
but
i
--
the
statutory
language
is
all
i
was
referring
to.
justice
potter
stewart
and
do
you
think
that
was
constitutionally
required
embroidery?
i
guess
you're
answer
has
to
be
yes,
i
gather.
justice
potter
stewart
if
--
that
is
if
there
was
no
objection
made
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
found
on
page
80,
i
think,
of
the
record.
justice
potter
stewart
then
it
would
--
then
it
would
very
likely
be
error
at
least
under
the
state
law
not
to
grant
a
free
transcript.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
or
not
in
the
constitution
it
would
be
error
under
state
law
not
to
grant
a
free
transcript
if
there
was
dispute
about
as
--
about
what
the
record
shows.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
--
since
they're
not
going
to
bystander's
bill
of
exceptions
or
something
equivalent
thereto
you
say
its
sufficient
under
--
both
under
the
state
law
and
constitutionally.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
apparently
a
full
hearing
at
which
the
trial
court
gave
the
lawyer
full
opportunity
to
say
whatever
he
wants
to
say
apparently,
and
in
addition
to
that,
gave
these
--
the
defendants
themselves
since
they
want
to
do
--
dispensing
the
services
of
the
lawyer
gave
them
a
full
opportunity
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
state
what
they
want
to
say.
as
far
as
i
can
see,
i'm
just
looking
through
the
record.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
that
both
counsel
that
turned
the
transcript
are
necessary
to
make
the
appeal
meaningful?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
had
it
--
you
had
counsel
on
appeal,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
have
question
of
fact
(inaudible)
--
the
affidavit
which
is
on
page
19
of
the
record,
you
don't
--
i
just
want
to
ask
you
whether
that
was
filed
before
the
hearing,
i
presume
it
was,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
trial
court
before
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
there's
no
showing
that
there
was
no
opportunity
to
take
exceptions,
factual
exceptions
to
that
either
orally
or
in
writing.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
--
it
was
there.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
time
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
opportunity,
wasn't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
the
issues
where
there's
sufficiency
of
the
evidence?
one
of
the
exceptions?
it
wasn't
stated
that
way.
it
was
stated
in
a
form,
“we're
not
guilty.”
justice
potter
stewart
and,
its
certainly
relevant
to
(inaudible)
it
couldn't
be
more
so,
could
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
there
was
opportunity
to
contradict
anything.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
thank
you.
