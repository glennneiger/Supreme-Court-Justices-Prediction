would
you
mind
indicating
(inaudible)
in
arguing
which
of
these

do
you
think
that
should
mean
(inaudible)
justice
arthur

(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
in
other
words,
do
you
say
that
the
relevance
is
a
one
way
to
(inaudible)
the
generality
of
the
charge
that
a
denial
was
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
of
the
hearing
on
the
application
--

--
for
a
defense.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
not
of
the
trial?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
mr.
lally,
a
litigant
who
could
afford
the
transcript
would
not
be
in
their
position
before
your
supreme
court,
would
he?
having
the
court
faced
upon
the
argument
made
on

motions
make
the
ultimate
determination
without
a
transcript
of
whether
the
evidence
justify
the
judgment.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
how
do
we
meet
therefore
the
basic
contention
of
this
case
that
having
afforded
a
right
of
appeal,
then
you
must
in
connection
with
the
appeal
give
equal
consideration
to
every
litigant,
rich
or
poor,
that
does
not
increase
under
your
premise,
does
it?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
how
do
we
know
that
in
this
case
since
there
is
no
stenographic
record?
justice
arthur

now,

(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now
this
is
the
evidence
outlined
by
the
files
as
it
said.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
isn't
there
a
(inaudible)
there
is
no
requirement
that
you
can
buy
a
transcript
in
order
to
raise
the
point
that
you
insist
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
isn't
that
correct?
