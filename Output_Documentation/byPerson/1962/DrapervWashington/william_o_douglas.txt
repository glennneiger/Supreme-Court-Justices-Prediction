if
you
have
no
due
process
questions,
(inaudible)
if
the
state
didn't
grant
an
appeal,
if
any.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
then
it
comes
down
to
a
discrimination
within
the
system
if
the
state
--
whether
that
explanation
is
fair
enough
to
violate
due
process.
justice
william
o.
douglas
on
equal
protection.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
it
so
held
in
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
amendment
--
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
fifth
amendment
has
no
equal
protection
clause
or
whether
the
--
it
(inaudible)
into
(inaudible)
--
into
the
problem
of
your
due
process
(inaudible)
in
equal
protection.
justice
william
o.
douglas
aren't
you
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
aren't
you
in
difficulty
on
that
when
you
come
to
errors
number
eight
and
nine?
justice
william
o.
douglas
numbers
eight
and
nine
of
what
the
court
which
discusses
on
page
81,
because
without
the
presence
of
a
transcript,
they
were
unable
to
specify
what
those
errors
were
with
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
sufficient
precision
to
satisfy
the
court?
justice
william
o.
douglas
isn't
that
--
aren't
those
errors
eight
and
nine
illustrative
of
the
utility
and
the
need
for
a
transcript
in
preparing
an
appeal?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
how
could
you
without
a
transcript,
unless
you
have
a
remarkable
memory?
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
you're
--
if
you
are
right
in
this,
your
position
is
adopted
to
this
case,
would
this
court
be
faced
with
the
problem
of
assigning
counsel
with
indigents
for
the
preparation
of
petitions
for
certiorari?
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
this
court,
i
said
with
this
court.
