in
fact,
what
you're
saying
inst
it,
that
this

switched
along
with
the
affidavit
with
the
state's
attorney
whether
the
man
is
a
--
was
in
a
--
equivalent
of
a
bystander's
bill
of
exception,

that
the
effect

what
you're
saying?

transcript
and
carried
it
up
with
the
way
you
say,
brought
it
up
to
the
court,
could
the
state
then
have
brought
in
this
affidavit
by
the
district
attorney
to
refute
what

in
the
transcript?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
it
have
been
tried
then
by
the
court
--
the
appellate
court?
how
would
you
determine
the
issue,
whether
you've
looked
at
it
and
said
we
looked
at
this
record
and
dismissed
it
as
frivolous?

well,
what
was
the
occasion

i
can
understand
that
findings
of
fact
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
defiance
of
guilty
but
what
were
the
issues
before

judge
when
he
made
this
finding
of
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
in
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
was
the
issue
at
that
moment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
under
your
rules
the
district
--
trial
judge
passes
on
that
first?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
was
in
this
kind
of
a
hearing
that
this
--
finds
it
--
his
findings
were
made
to
which
you
refer
--
on
which
you
rely?
justice
hugo
l.
black
both
of
them
were
entitled
to
offer
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
kind
of
hearing
is
required
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
evidence
is
admissible
on
the
part
of
each
project
on
that
issue?
