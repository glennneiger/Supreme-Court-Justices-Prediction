mr.
charles
f.
luce
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
washington
reviewing
a
judgment
which
in
effect
denied
the
petitioners,
mr.
draper
and
mr.
lorentzen,
a
right
of
appeal
because
they
lack
the
funds
to
purchase
a
transcript
at
the
trial
of
proceeding.
petitioners
are
presently
incarcerated
in
the
penitentiary
at
walla
walla,
washington
under
maximum
sentences
which
totaled
40
years.
they
are
admittedly
without
funds.
the
issue
in
this
case
as
petitioners
see
it
is
whether
consistent
with
equal
protection
of
law
and
due
process
of
law,
the
state
of
washington
may
deny
the
right
to
appeal
to
indigents
but
not
to
others.
whenever
the
trial
court
finds
that
the
asserted
grounds
of
appeal
are
frivolous
involved
in
a
determination
of
this
case
or
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
--
the
counsel,
the
preceding
counsel
taken
part
of
my
record
away
here
--
mr.
charles
f.
luce
--
in
fact,
they've
taken
the
whole
thing.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
you
have
the
record
early
as
well
--
mr.
charles
f.
luce
i
assume
there
was
no
complicity
on
part
of
the
state
on
what
happened.
the
general
principles
which
apply
to
this
case
are,
i
think
quite
clear,
they'd
been
laid
down
in
two
cases
to
this
court.
first
of
all,
griffin
against
illinois,
decided
in
1956,
wherein
the
court
said
or
at
least
the
opinion
of
the
majority
of
the
judges
--
thank
you
--
that
destitute
defendants
must
be
afforded
as
adequate
and
appellate
review
as
defendants
who
have
money
enough
to
buy
transcripts.
and
secondly,
the
principle
laid
down
in
a
subsequent
case
out
of
the
same
state,
state
of
washington.
the
fact
that
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
judge
that
there
was
no
reversible
error
cannot
be
a
substitute
for
the
right
to
full
appellate
review,
and
i
emphasize
that,
full
appellate
review,
available
to
all
defendants
who
can
afford
the
expense
of
transcript.
in
the
eskridge
case,
the
trial
judge
upon
being
requested
by
the
indigent
defendant
who
was
convicted
i
think
in
that
case
of
a
murder
had
given
life
sentence
in
prison,
the
trial
judge
upon
passing
on
the
request
of
that
particular
defendant
for
free
transcript
ruled
that
there
was
no
substantial
ground
for
the
appeal
and
that
justice
would
not
be
promoted
by
granting
transcript,
hence,
it
was
not
granted.
this
court
when
the
case
finally
got
back
up
here
many
years
later
held
that
that
determination
by
the
trial
court
was
not
an
adequate
substitute
for
the
full
appellate
review
that
a
defendant
with
funds
could
obtain
under
the
rules
of
the
state
of
washington
and
that
in
effect
and
i
might
add,
now
in
effect.
let's
take
a
look
at
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
involving
mr.
draper
and
mr.
lorentzen
as
applied
to
the
principles
laid
down
in
the
griffin
case
and
in
the
eskridge
case.
the
state
of
washington
still,
as
i
mentioned
gives
a
full
right
of
review
to
those
who
can
pay
for
it.
if
you
have
the
necessary
funds
to
purchase
a
transcript,
you
may
do
so,
and
all
that
you
have
to
do
then
is
to
have
that
transcript
certified
by
the
trial
judge,
file
a
brief
with
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
and
you
are
given
a
full
scale
review.
you
do
not
have,
at
any
stage,
to
convince
the
trial
judge
of
the
merits
of
your
appeal.
indeed
under
our
procedure
in
the
state
of
washington,
the
trial
judge
never
gets
an
opportunity
in
the
criminal
case
to
state
what
he
thinks
of
the
merits
of
the
appeal,
a
matter
never
comes
before
him
and
there's
no
procedure
by
which
he
can
indicate
his
opinion
to
the
supreme
court.
now
in
this
particular
case,
the
defendants
having
been
convicted
on
two
counts
of
robbery
after
a
jury
trial
appeal.
at
the
trial
being
without
funds,
they've
been
represented
by
court
appointed
counsel,
the
same
court
appointed
counsel
represented
them
upon
the
--
their
request
for
a
free
transcript
in
order
that
they
might
appeal.
now,
in
considering
the
procedures
followed
in
this
case,
the
court
should
have
in
mind
the
rules
laid
down
by
the
state
of
washington
following
the
eskridge
case
wherein
the
--
this
court
held
that
the
procedures
previously
followed
by
the
state
of
washington
did
not
meet
the
constitutional
test
of
due
process.
following
the
eskridge
case,
our
court
laid
down
rules
which
i
have
set
forth
in
full
on
our
brief
at
pages
3
and
4.
in
order
to
get
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
straight,
i
would
like
to
read
these
rules
and
then
refer
to
the
record
to
show
wherein
and
how
they
were
complied
with
in
this
case.
the
supreme
court
of
washington
says
that
an
indigent
defendant
desiring
to
appeal
shall
file
an
affidavit
in
which
he
set
forth
the
fact
of
his
indigency,
among
other
things
that
an
affidavit
is
in
the
record
at
pages
10
and
11.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
yes,
i
will
do
that,
sir.
the
rule
next
requires
that
the
indigent
seeking
a
free
transcript
shall
specify
and
i
quote
the
rule,
these
are
quoted
on
page
3
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
“shall
specify
the
errors
which
he
claims
were
committed.”
and
if
it
is
claimed
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient
to
justify
the
verdict,
this
will
specify
what
particularity
in
what
respect
he
believes
the
evidence
is
lacking.
now
at
the
record,
in
the
record
on
pages
10
and
11,
the
petitioners
have
set
forth
some
12
or
13
errors
which
they
alleged
were
committed.
i
won't
refer
to
all
of
them,
but
the
ones
which
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
principal
ones,
they
alleged
that
evidence
was
admitted,
that
is
testimony
was
admitted
over
objection
improperly.
they
alleged
that
exhibits
were
improperly
admitted
over
objection,
they
alleged
the
trial
judge
with
prejudice
against
them,
and
they
alleged
in
effect
that
the
evidence
did
not
sustain
the
verdict.
i
might
say
that
the
list
of
claimed
errors
appears
to
have
been
drawn
in
the
penitentiary
at
walla
walla.
i
don't
think
a
lawyer
drew
that
list,
but
nevertheless,
the
list
does
cover
the
four
points
which
i
mentioned
and
some
others
which
are
slightly
redundant,
so
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
complied
with
the
rules
of
the
state
of
washington
insofar
as
they
were
able
to
do
so,
not
having
a
transcript,
well
of
course.
the
rules
go
on
to
say
that
if
the
state
is
at
the
opinion
that
the
errors
alleged
can
properly
be
presented
on
appeal
without
a
transcript
of
all
the
testimony,
it
may
make
a
showing
of
what
portion
of
the
transcript
will
suffice,
or
if
it
believes
that
a
narrative
statement
will
be
adequate,
it
shall
so
state
and
shall
inform
the
court
that
the
narrative
statement
will
be
available
to
the
indigent
defendant
who
wants
to
appeal.
now
in
this
instance,
the
state
did
neither
of
these
things,
rather,
as
it
appears
on
page
21
of
the
record,
beginning
actually
on
page
19,
it
recited
in
a
lengthy
affidavit
filed
by
the
deputy
prosecutor
who
tried
the
case
that
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
of
the
guilt
of
these
petitioners
now
before
the
court,
but
he
did
not
alleged
that
they
could
obtain
an
appellate
review
with
something
less
than
the
full
transcript
or
with
a
narrative
statement.
it
is
simply
that
the
prosecutor
just
didn't
touch
on
it
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
f.
luce
to
defend,
mr.
justice
white,
on
what
the
point
was.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
yes,
my
contention
would
be
this,
and
i
think
it's
consistent
with
the
decision
of
this
court.
but
since
an
appellant
with
funds
has
the
right
to
order
a
full
transcript
no
matter
what
the
trial
judge
thinks
to
the
merits
of
appeal
and
put
their
transcript
before
the
supreme
court
of
washington
and
let
the
sup
--
mr.
charles
f.
luce
yes,
that
--
well
--
but
i
understood
your
question
to
be
whether
i
would
contend
that
in
such
a
case,
the
man
would
be
entitled
to
a
transcript.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
oh,
that's
correct.
yes,
yes.
that's
the
--
that
i
think
is
the
vice
of
the
rules.
the
state
had
a
few
comments
in
its
affidavit
answering
and
resisting
the
request
for
a
free
transcript
on
the
alleged
grounds
of
appeal
but
those
comments
were
very
general.
for
instance
on
page
21
of
the
record,
the
prosecutor
swears
in
his
affidavit
in
response
to
the
argument
that
the
trial
judge
was
prejudiced,
he
says
that
he
--
the
prosecutor
denies
that
there
was
any
perjury
committed
or
that
the
trial
judge
was
in
anywise
prejudiced
against
any
of
these
defendants.
well,
that's
simply
a
general
denial.
similarly
with
regard
to
the
petitioners'
allegation
that
errors
had
been
committed
in
admitting
testimony
and
exhibits,
that
all
the
prosecutor
did,
as
appears
on
page
22
of
the
record,
was
to
enter
a
general
denial
to
that.
he
says,
in
his
affidavit,
that
no
exhibit
or
testimony
was
improperly
admitted
in
evidence
but
he
does
not
go
into
the
particular
questions
that
had
been
objected
to
nor
the
particular
exhibits
that
had
been
admitted
over
objection.
and
nowhere,
nowhere
in
the
record
that
is
before
this
court,
or
that
was
before
the
supreme
court
of
washington
is
there
a
transcript
of
the
questions
that
were
asked
objected
to
and
testimony
that
was
admitted
over
objection
similarly
with
regard
to
exist.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
that's
correct.
he
couldn't
have
--
he
couldn't
in
that
case
have
done
much
more.
on
the
other
hand,
i
don't
know
how
you
would
demonstrate
prejudice
of
a
trial
judge
without
a
full
transcript.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
that
is
correct.
the
same
thing
would
be
true
if
the
contention
of
the
evidence
failed
to
sustain
the
verdict.
the
rules
of
washington
go
on
to
say,
as
to
what
the
trial
court
does
in
this
proceeding
where
the
indigent
is
seeking
a
free
transcript,
that
the
trial
court
in
disposing
of
an
indigent
motion
were
statement
of
facts
that
county
expense
shall
enter
findings
of
fact
upon
the
following
the
matters:
(a)
the
defendants
indigency
where
there's
no
issue
on
that
and
it's
admitted
on
all
sides
and
the
court
so
stated
that
he
would
have
been,
defendants
are
indigent,
(b)
the
trial
court
shall
enter
findings
of
fact
on
which
of
the
errors,
if
any
are
frivolous
and
the
reasons
why
they
are
frivolous.
now
what
did
the
trial
court
do
about
that?
on
page
27
of
the
record
we
have
findings
at
the
trial
court
on
which
of
the
errors
are
frivolous.
and
again,
all
that
the
trial
court
did
was
to
enter
what
amounts
to
general
denial
or
general
statements
that
the
allegations
of
error
have
any
merit.
for
example,
with
regard
to
the
contention
that
evidence
was
improperly
admitted,
the
trial
judge
says
on
page
27
--
or
finds
on
page
27
of
the
record,
near
the
bottom
of
page
f
as
to
assignment
of
error
number
7,
the
court
finds
that
the
evidence
offered
by
the
state
against
these
defendants
--
well,
that
is
not
the
--
that
has
to
do
with
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
the
finding
with
reference
to
the
admission
of
exhibits,
is
b
on
page
27
as
to
assignments
of
error,
2
and
8,
relating
to
identification
on
the
list
of
exhibits,
each
exhibit
would
properly
identify
at
the
trial
the
material
and
relevant
to
the
issues,
and
that
the
objection
of
exhibit
2,
the
gun
identified
by
the
accomplice
robert
jennings,
as
one
used
in
the
holdup
as
well
as
the
objections
to
the
remaining
exhibits
offered
go
to
the
weight
the
jury
should
place
upon
the
exhibits
rather
than
their
admissibility.
but
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
these
findings
of
fact
that
advised
the
supreme
court
of
washington
what
was
before
the
trial
judge
at
the
time
he
made
these
rulings
which
he
says
in
his
finding
of
fact
were
correct
rulings.
the
trial
judge
did
not
comply
with
that
part
of
the
rules
of
the
state
of
washington
which
say
that
he
shall
find
what
portion
of
the
stenographic
transcript
shall
be
necessary
to
effectuate
the
indigents'
appeals.
they
simply
overlooked
that
particular
section
or
he
construed
the
rules
in
this
manner
apparently
that
if
he
concluded
that
the
trial
judge
concluded
that
the
appeal
had
no
merit
then
here
--
it
wasn't
up
to
him
to
specify
which
part
of
the
record
would
be
necessary
to
effectuate
the
appeals.
petitioners
contend
that
this
procedure
on
its
face
does
not
give
an
indigent
defendant
in
the
state
of
washington
the
same
full
appellate
review,
if
indeed
it
gives
them
any
appellate
review
before
the
supreme
court
of
washington
as
compared
with
what
a
defendant
who
have
some
money
to
buy
the
record
can
get.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
i
don't
have
that
performing
--
mr.
charles
f.
luce
--
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
well,
yes,
but
this
court
has
construed
that
statute
--
mr.
charles
f.
luce
--
in
coppedge
case
in
such
a
way
that
i
don't
know
how,
how
the
statute
could
be
complied
with
unless
a
district
--
federal
district
court
gave
a
transcript
to
the
indigents
who
have
filed
his
motion
for
an
appeal
in
forma
pauperis.
in
fact,
as
i
recall
or
which
the
concurring
opinion,
i
believe
it
was
by
you
that
indicated
that
that
flat
rule
should
be
announced
because
that
was
the
result
that
would
be
reached
under
the
interpretation
that
the
chief
justice's
opinion
placed
upon
the
statute
to
which
you
refer.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
yes,
so
far
as
the
statutory
language
is
concerned,
i
don't
think
that
without
the
embroidery
that
this
court
has
placed
on
it
goes
quite
as
far
as
our
rule.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
well,
yes.
i
think
the
court
would
have
power
under
its
supervisory
powers
to
require
it
whether
that
was
constitutionally
required
or
not,
but
i
think
that
the
wording
of
the
opinion
is
cast
somewhat
in
due
process,
terms
right
to
counsel.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
right
to
appeal,
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
well,
the
griffin
case
and
the
eskridge
case
talked
jointly
of
due
process
and
equal
protection.
i
think
the
better
clause
to
handle
it
under
as
the
due
process
question
because
--
or
the
due
process
clause
because
it's
broader
and
encompasses
more.
it
encompasses,
for
example,
the
question
of
whether
the
provision
of
a
record
on
appeal
is
adequate
either
for
indigents
or
nonindigents
where
as
the
equal
protection
clause
simply
looks
at
how
do
you
treat
the
nonindigent
as
compared
to
the
indigent.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
well,
i
suppose
it
wouldn't
because
this
court
would
hold
this
(inaudible)
mr.
charles
f.
luce
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that
we're
dealing
with
liberty,
where
we're
dealing
with
life
as
we
are
in
criminal
cases,
that
the
courts
are
more
concerned
with
assuring
that
litigants
have
the
fullest
rights
than
were
as
in
a
typical
civil
case,
we
were
dealing
only
with
property.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
same
is
true
with
due
process.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
i
would
be
willing
if
the
case
be
decided
on
either
grounds.
but
i
feel
that
the
due
process
clause
probably
fits
the
case
better
and
i
noticed
in
the
arguments
yesterday
that
the
--
mr.
fortas
felt
the
same
way
with
regard
to
the
grounds
upon
which
the
right
to
counsel
that
the
trials
have
been
placed.
but
i
think
it
could
be
well
decided
on
a
equal
protection
ground
of
this
case.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
not
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
since
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
an
appeal,
that's
right.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
yes,
that's
correct.
but
i
feel
--
mr.
charles
f.
luce
that
in
the
concept
of
due
process,
there's
such
a
consideration
of
fairness
that
in
--
it
imports
characteristics
of
equal
protection
also
but
i
think
you
can
say
it's
so
unfair.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
well,
i
noticed
the
court
have
put
them
together
and
possibly
that's
the
reason.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
five
minutes.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
mr.
chief
justice.
in
my
remaining
five
minutes,
i
would
like
to
point
out
first
that
the
contention
that
the
petitioners
here
have
somehow
admitted
the
accuracy
of
the
prosecutor's
affidavit
is
not
justified
in
the
record.
the
preceding
in
which
that
affidavit
was
filed
was
a
proceeding
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
the
petitioners
were
entitled
to
a
free
transcript.
and
the
rules
in
woods
against
rhay,
which
i
quoted
from
extensively
in
my
opening
argument,
do
not
provide
that
either
the
applicant
for
a
free
transcript
or
the
state
shall
file
such
an
affidavit
as
the
prosecutor
filed
in
this
case.
and
certainly
the
rules
do
not
require
that
the
defendants
seeking
of
free
transcript
file
a
counter
affidavit
and
say
in
effect
that
the
state's
affidavit
reciting
the
facts
is
incorrect.
there's
just
nothing
in
the
rules
that
requires
that
to
be
done.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
at
that
time,
mr.
justice
black,
the
hearing
which
is
required
is
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
alleged
grounds
of
appeal
set
out
by
the
applicant
for
a
free
transcript
are
frivolous
or
not.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
the
rules
are
silent
on
that
point,
but
the
--
as
a
practical
matter,
what
happened
here
in
the
evidence
such
as
it
was,
was
simply
the
recollection
of
the
attorney
who
represented
the
defendants
at
the
trial,
the
recollection
of
one
of
the
defendants
himself,
the
recollection
of
the
deputy
prosecutor
who
had
tried
the
case,
and
the
recollection
of
the
trial
judge.
that
--
that's
--
there
was
no
evidence
taken.
it
was
simply
an
oral
argument
in
which
each
got
up
and
in
turn
stated
how
he
remembered
it
happened.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
one
of
them.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
that's
correct,
but
none
of
the
--
neither
of
the
defendants
nor
their
counsel
had
the
benefit
of
a
transcript
with
the
testimony
to
refresh
his
recollection
of
what
these
errors
were.
now,
for
instance,
there
was
an
error
alleged
in
here
that
a
gun
had
been
improperly
admitted
which
it
was
contended
by
the
state
it
had
been
used
in
pursuant
to
the
robbers.
that
gun
was
apparently,
you
can
find
here
in
the
record,
it
was
found
in
a
corridor
of
the
same
hotel
in
which
two
of
the
--
or
one
of
the
petitioners
were
staying
and
an
argument
ensued
is
to
whether
the
gun
had
been
properly
identified
as
the
gun
used
in
these
alleged
robberies.
this
record
does
not
have
before
it,
or
does
not
have
in
it
any
of
the
foundation
that
was
laid
by
the
state
as
an
identification
through
that
gun.
the
same
thing
is
true
of
a
jacket
that
was
offered
in
evidence.
the
supreme
court
of
washington
just
doesn't
have
--
didn't
have
before
it
the
foundation
that
was
laid
identifying
that
jacket
which
it
was
alleged
belong
to
one
of
the
defendants
and
in
which
some
money
was
found
in
the
pocket,
which
allegedly
had
been
stolen
in
the
course
of
these
robbery.
now,
the
point
that
the
petitioners
make
here
is
if
that
they
had
the
money
to
buy
a
transcript,
they
would
have
been
able
to
bring
before
the
supreme
court
of
washington
the
whole
course
of
events,
all
of
the
happenings
at
the
trial
and
if
there
had
been
an
error
in
the
admission
of
this
gun,
if
the
foundation
has
not
been
properly
laid,
they
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
show
that
to
the
supreme
court
of
washington.
but,
under
the
procedure
here
adapted,
they
simply
did
not
have
that
opportunity.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
i'm
sorry,
i
can't
hear
you.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
yes,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
f.
luce
no,
the
--
there
is
no
question
in
this
record
that
the
two
exhibits
that
i
have
referred
to,
the
gun
and
the
jacket,
were
not
in
these
--
in
these
numbers.
there's
no
question
in
the
record
about
what
these
items
were
objected
to.
and
the
objection
was
overruled,
the
court
--
in
the
trial
court
holding
that
the
objection
went
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence
rather
than
to
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence,
which
may
or
may
not
be
the
case
depending
of
course
on
the
foundation
of
--
mr.
charles
f.
luce
well
this
--
you
mean
in
the
state
courts?
mr.
charles
f.
luce
well,
in
this
--
our
case,
of
course,
do
not
present
that
question
because
the
court
did
appoint
the
counsel.
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
follows
that
because
an
indigent
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
free
transcript
where
a
full
transcript
is
given
to
a
moneyed
appellant
that
the
counsel
in
a
petition
for
certiorari
must
therefore
be
granted.
i
don't
think
that
it
was.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
i
didn't
hear
you
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
well,
i
didn't
come
here
to
argue
the
right
to
counsel
on
appeal
because
it
wasn't
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
yes
that's
right,
though
the
issue
just
isn't
in
this
case
but
i
would
certainly
contend
that
--
mr.
charles
f.
luce
and
so
i
argue
that
the
transcript
is
necessary,
yes.
and
i
would
be
willing
to
go
forward
if
the
question
were
in
the
case
and
further
argue
that
counsel
is
necessary
on
the
appeal.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
yes,
i
certainly
would
argue
that
and
it
maybe
noted
in
the
california
case
that
just
proceeded
this
year
that
is
approximately
the
procedure
they
used.
they
give
free
transcripts
to
everybody.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
and
incidentally,
california
is
not
bankrupt
as
a
result.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
well,
apparently
not.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
on
--
i
wouldn't
see
the
issue
quite
that
way.
i
think
the
issue
is
whether
the
state
giving
a
full
review
to
a
man
who
can
afford
to
buy
a
transcript.
the
full
scale
appellate
review
doesn't
have
to
give
that
same
full
review
on
a
transcript
--
mr.
charles
f.
luce
well,
i
think
that
it
is
implicit
in
these
cases
that
the
same
full
appellate
review
shall
be
given
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
f.
luce
--
to
an
indigent.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
i
think
we
have
that
under
that
procedure,
mr.
justice
harlan,
but
i
certainly
feel
also
that
it
would
be
advisable
if
the
broader
would
be
stated.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
i
don't
construe
the
griffin
case
and
the
eskridge
case
that
way.
i
think
that
what
they
were
saying
was
this,
that
if
an
appellant
who
had
money
would
not
reasonably
require
a
transcript.
for
instance
here,
we're
just
attacking
--
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
under
which
he
were
convicted
or
for
instance,
if
his
objection
to
his
conviction
was
something
that
happened
outside
the
courtroom
tampering
with
the
jury
or
something
of
that
nature,
that
he
wouldn't
have
to,
the
indigent
then
wouldn't
have
to
be
given
a
full
transcript
because
a
moneyed
appellant
wouldn't
want
one
either.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
yes,
it
was.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
filed
before
the
hearing.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
well,
i
think
that
there
was
no
opportunity
in
this
sense
that
the
rules
didn't
contemplate
that
kind
of
an
affidavit
be
filed
in
the
first
place
nor
did
it
contemplate
--
that
they
contemplate
that
the
affidavit
to
be
answered.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
but
there
was
time
--
there
was
time.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
there
was
a
time
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
f.
luce
well,
it
--
that
affidavit
was
just
extraneous
to
any
issue
that
was
before
the
--
that
was
before
the
--
mr.
charles
f.
luce
--
trial
court
in
its
passing
on
the
application
for
a
free
transcript
under
the
rules
and
once
again
for
any
--
mr.
charles
f.
luce
yes,
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
well,
i
would
have
to
agree
that
it
was
relevant
to
that,
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
luce
well,
i
think
that
the
record
shows
a
contradiction
that
these
people
contend
in
their
request
for
a
free
transcript
that
the
evidence
does
not
show
they're
guilty
and
whether
they
then
would
have
had
to
file
another
affidavit
and
say
that
we
don't
think
we're
guilty
for
the
following
reasons.
i
don't
think
is
contemplated
by
our
rules.
at
least
the
rule
is
not
clear
that
that's
required.
