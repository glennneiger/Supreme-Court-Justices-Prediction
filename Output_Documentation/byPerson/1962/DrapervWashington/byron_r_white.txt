had
the
evidence,
and
the

said
it's
a
frivolous
point.

in

so,
mr.
lally
isn't
that
--
i
think
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
the
supreme
court
of
washington
gave
full
appellate
review
on
the
merits
to
this
assignment
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
not
hold
that
--
that
it
was
a
frivolous
ground
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
in
the
rhay
case,
in
your
woods
against
rhay
case,
that
the
supreme
court
of
washington
said
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
had
held
that
an
appeal
could
not
be
denied
on
the
grounds
that
the
point
was
frivolous,
whether
the
defendants
contention
was
that
the
evidence
was
insufficiently
sustained
the
conviction.
and
in
its
own
--
in
its
own
words,
the
washington
court
in
dealing
with
a
contention
but
there
was
insufficient
evidence
certainly
wasn't
just
making
a
preliminary
determination
as
to
whether
there
was
frivolous
point
raised
but
was
giving
full
review
on
the
merits
but
without
a
transcript.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
say
this
--
that
this
whole
appellate
procedure
that
was
going
through
in
this
particular
case
really
is
equivalent
to
a
full
appellate
review
in
a
fair
way.
and
a
--
and
not
significantly
discriminatory
review
as
compared
with
what
would
happen
if
there
had
been
a
transcript.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
help
him
make
his
motion
in
the
trial
court
but
is
the
practice
to
have
the
counsel
continue
on
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
the
transcripts
as
well
as
the
counsel,
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
whether
--
whether
counsel
was
necessary
or
not
a
transcript
--
whether
a
counsel
is
present
or
not,
a
transcript
is
necessary.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
don't
give
the
lawyers.
