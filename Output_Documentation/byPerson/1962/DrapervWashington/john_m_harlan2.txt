justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
conceive
of
this
question
as
being
basically
a
due
process
question
or
an
equal
protection
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
suppose
broader
and
narrower
because
if
you
look
at
this
as
an
equal
protection
question
why
--
why
wouldn't
it
apply
equally
to
civil
cases
as
well
as
criminal?
that
equal
protection
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
know
but
what's
the
rationale
in
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
equal
protection
is
the
constitutional
concept
certainly
is
not
limited
to
criminal
cases.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
covers
property
rights.
it
covers
every
conceivable
kind
of
a
right
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
where
equal
protection
is
denied.
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
necessarily.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
that
affidavit?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
in
the
record
i
gather,
don't
you,
that
the
--
there
was
no
court
opinion
in
griffin
that
the
two
--
the
prevailing
things,
both
were
things
to
recognize,
things
to
say
that
transcripts
were
not
automatically
necessary
in
all
cases.
and
eskridge,
it
was
(inaudible)
to
reiterate
the
same
thing
so
that
in
all
of
the
cases
that
you
were
relying
on
here,
you
have
the
majority
of
the
court
subscribing
to
those
opinions
all
agreeing
that
there
is
no
automatic
rule
involved
that
requires
a
furnishing
of
a
transcript
in
every
case.
and
therefore,
the
question
that
is
involved
here
surely
must
be
whether
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
something
more
than
what
was
called
the
bystander's
bill
of
these
affidavits
or
something
more
than
the
state
procedure
was
required
in
order
to
give
this
man
a
fair
break
on
whether
he
should've
had
a
hearing
on
this
appeal,
isn't
that
the
issue?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
do
you
rely
onto
that
in
many
of
these
cases?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
here's
--
here's
what
i'm
referring
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
my
brother
black's
opinion
in
griffin
and
it's
repeated
in
justice
frankfurter's
concurring
opinion,
his
opinion
was
necessary
to
make
the
court
in
that
case
and
it's
repeated
unless
my
recollection
serves
me
in
the
per
curiam
opinion
in
eskridge.
and
it
says
--
justice
black
says
in
his
opinion,
“we
do
not
hold
however
that
illinois
must
purchase
a
stenographer's
transcript
in
every
case
where
a
defendant
cannot
buy
it.”
now,
a
so-called
rich
defendant
or
rich
appellant
can
of
course,
always
buy
one.
and
therefore
the
statement
would
seem
to
indicate,
that
there
is
a
margin
of
difference,
that
a
constitution
may
be
recognized
in
what
a
state
has
to
do
in
affording
a
so-called
indigent
a
fair
right
of
appeal.
and
the
opinion
goes
on
the
supreme
court,
that
is
referring
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
may
find
other
means
of
affording
adequate
and
effective
appellate
review
to
indigent
individuals,
individual
--
indigent
defendants.
and
then
it
was
said
as
an
example
of
bystander's
bill
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
so,
i
submit
to
you
that
the
question
--
unless
you're
arguing
that
it
is
a
matter
of
law
in
every
instance,
in
every
instance
an
indigent
in
order
to
be
put
on
an
equal
footing
in
constitution
with
a
so-called
rich
defendant
is
entitled
to
the
transcript
unless
you're
arguing
that
i
submit
that
the
--
you've
got
to
meet
this
case
on
the
basis
of
what
actually
happened
here
under
the
washington
proceeding.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
do
have
to
make
a
broader
rule
to
sustain
your
position
on
the
broader
front?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
language
i
read
to
you
doesn't
bear
that
interpretation
because
it
(inaudible)
to
say
refer
to
a
bystander's
will
--
bill
which
obviously
presupposes
a
situation
in
which
more
than
questions
of
law
are
involved,
where
evidence
is
involved.
