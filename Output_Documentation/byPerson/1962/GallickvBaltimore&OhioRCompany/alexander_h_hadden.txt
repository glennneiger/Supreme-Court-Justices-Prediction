mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
nurenberg
has
dwelled
at
some
length
on
two
issues
presented
in
this
case.
he
has
not
dwelled
on
the
third.
he
maintains
at
the
outset
and
i
should
like
to
address
the
preliminary
words
of
this
matter
what
issues
are
present
for
the
decision
of
this
court
at
this
time.
mr.
nurenberg's
reference
in
his
brief
and
quote
to
a
large
extent
also
in
his
argument
today
has
contended
to
the
court
that
the
sole
question
presented
for
its
decision
in
this
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
determining
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
of
causation
to
take
this
case
to
the
jury.
respondent
submits
to
the
contrary
that
there
are
three
questions
presented
to
this
court.
first,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
record
evidence
of
railroad
negligence.
mr.
nurenberg
has
not
devoted
any
attention
at
all
to
that
question
up
until
the
present
moment.
second,
whether
there
was
sufficient
evidence
of
causation.
and
third,
whether
or
not
the
special
verdict
returned
by
the
jury
in
this
case
is
sufficient
to
support
a
judgment
for
the
petitioner
or
whether
on
the
contrary
it
does
not
require
entry
of
final
judgment
for
the
respondent.
i
would
say
with
regard
to
those
three
issues
that
they
are
all
squarely
presented
by
this
case
for
decision
at
this
time
and
they
cannot
be
that.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
cases
present
questions
of
federal
law
which
must
be
determined
uniformly
throughout
the
states
without
regard
to
the
degrees
of
state
procedure.
i
think
mr.
nurenberg's
own
argument
in
the
length
of
time
he
has
spent
today
on
a
special
verdict
resolves
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
court
must
not
look
at
the
special
verdict
and
determine
for
itself
what
the
meaning
of
the
jury
was
as
expressed
in
the
special
verdict.
now,
there
are
cases
of
one
of
which
mr.
nurenberg
has
cited,
the
ellerman
case,
atlantic
&
gulf
stevedores
against
ellerman
and
another
one
arnold
against
panhandle
railroad
company
which
in
both
of
which
this
court
has
held.
it
has
not
held
specifically
that
the
interpretation
of
special
findings
is
for
this
court
but
in
effect
sub
silentio
as
so
held
because
it
is
--
has
examined
state
court
jury
verdicts,
state
court
special
findings
and
itself
for
which
the
conclusion
of
the
interpretation
to
be
placed
upon
it.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes
sir.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
no,
that's
implicit
in
it
your
honor
but
the
question
as
i
put
it
the
third
one
was
the
matter
of
whether
or
not
the
special
verdict
does
not
require
entry
of
final
judgment
for
the
respondent
railroad.
and
of
course,
implicit
in
that
question
is
the
jury's
finding
of
the
total
lack
of
foreseeability
and
therefore
necessarily
the
question
of
foreseeability
is
involved
in
that
question
as
indeed
it
is
both
in
the
question
approximate
cause
under
the
question
of
negligence.
in
as
much
as
all
of
these
three
questions
are
present
before
the
court,
i
would
like
to
turn
my
attention
to
what
i
regard
as
the
one
which
the
court
must
first
get
over
in
order
to
reach
to
--
to
reverse
the
result
now
--
which
now
obtains
in
the
case.
as
mr.
nurenberg
points
out
the
jury
in
this
case
was
asked
to
return
and
did
return
a
special
verdict.
no
general
verdict
was
returned.
the
jury
was
asked
to
express
its
findings
in
terms
of
the
23
questions
framed
by
the
trial
judge.
consistent
with
federal
court
procedure,
ohio
procedure
is
entirely
consistent
i
might
add
in
this
connection
with
federal
court
procedure.
federal
court
procedure
and
ohio
procedure
both
provide
for
special
verdicts
and
in
both
cases
no
(inaudible)
--
no
general
verdict
is
returned
by
the
jury.
under
the
federal
rules,
federal
rule
49
(a),
the
court
submits
to
the
jury
questions
on
issues
of
fact,
disputed
issues
of
fact
and
gives
only
such
as
instructions
as
are
required
by
the
jury
to
render
an
intelligent
decision
on
the
question
submitted.
that
was
done
here.
it
was
done
for
the
purpose
of
withdrawing
from
the
jurors
the
emotionalism
that
was
intended
--
was
attended
upon
the
trial
of
this
highly
charged
emotional
case
with
the
man
very
badly
crippled.
mr.
nurenberg
seeks
to
avoid
the
legal
effect
of
the
finding
of
lack
of
foreseeability
on
a
ground
which
respondent
has
great
difficulty
in
grasping.
he
has
not
cited
any
cases
which
dispense
with
the
legal
requirement
of
foreseeability
of
risk
of
harm
as
unnecessary
and
indispensable
for
predicate
to
liability
for
negligence.
respondent
submits
that
there
are
no
such
cases.
this
court
repeatedly
and
time
after
time
in
federal
employers'
liability
act
cases
has
held
that
it
must
appear
with
reason,
with
reason
from
the
proofs
that
an
injury
such
as
sustained
by
a
plaintiff
could
have
been
anticipated
from
the
negligence
or
the
conditions
existing
on
the
railroads
property.
that
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
20,
most
--
for
the
most
part,
22
also
and
question
13
also
your
honor.
it's
our
feeling
that
this
special
verdict
must
be
regarded
as
a
whole.
in
the
ellerman
case,
in
the
arnold
case,
this
court
has
twice
held
that
the
view
of
special
findings
must
be
adopted
which
serves
to
harmonize
those
findings
one
with
the
other.
the
court
has
specifically
stated
that
appellate
courts
must
not
grow
for
conceptions
of
the
facts
which
will
make
the
jury
findings
inconsistent.
here,
mr.
nurenberg
asked
the
court
to
adopt
the
finding
which
not
necessarily
makes
the
findings
to
adopt
the
view
which
makes
the
findings
inconsistent
but
he
asks
the
court
for
reasons
which
i
fail
to
understand
to
disregard
entirely
these
three
findings
which
are
favorable
to
the
respondent.
it
is
not
--
he
does
not
hypothesize
any
view
of
the
facts
or
any
view
of
the
case
under
which
these
three
findings
can
be
harmonized
with
the
remainder
of
the
verdict.
respondent
submits
that
there
is
a
means
under
which
that
the
--
all
findings
maybe
harmonized
one
with
the
other.
that
view
is
one
which
can
be
taken
only
after
a
brief
look
at
the
instructions
given
by
the
court
to
the
jury
to
assist
in
reaching
its
factual
determinations.
contrary
--
contrary
to
what
mr.
nurenberg
has
said
there
is
no
find
--
there
is
no
instruction
in
this
record
whether
in
writing
as
requested
by
the
parties
or
orally
given
by
the
judge
which
told
the
jury
that
it
wasn't
legally
necessary
for
them
in
order
to
reach
a
finding
of
negligence
in
order
to
say
that
the
respondent
was
negligent.
it
was
legally
indispensible
for
the
jury
also
to
find
that
a
risk
of
harm
was
foreseeable
and
should
have
been
anticipated
by
the
respondent.
no
such
instruction
was
given.
it
is
the
fact
that
the
jury
was
extensively
charged
on
the
general
subject
of
foreseeability.
that
question
was
at
the
heart
of
this
case
from
the
very
time
the
pleadings
were
filed.
respondent
denied
the
foreseeability
in
its
answer
and
that
was
controverted
in
the
reply.
the
nature
of
this
man's
disease,
the
nature
of
the
way
in
which
it
is
said
to
have
been
contracted
by
him
is
so
incredible,
it's
so
unique,
so
oddly
unprecedented
that
foreseeability
by
the
very
nature
of
the
case
lay
at
the
heart
of
it
from
the
outset.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
what
is
sustainable
your
honor?
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes
sir.
i'm
saying
--
i'm
saying,
first,
that
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
of
negligence.
second,
that
even
if
there
was,
the
jury
resolved
the
question
of
foreseeability
and
therefore
negligence
against
the
petitioner.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
the
court
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
--
did
not
expressly
discuss
--
the
court
discussed
the
question.
it
reached
no
specific
conclusion.
it
said
merely
that
--
i
believe
the
language
of
the
court
below
was
that
this
finding
could
furnish
the
gravamen
of
a
--
of
the
cause
of
action
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
whether
that
amounts
to
a
holding
on
its
part
that
it
so
held,
i
rather
doubt.
i
think
that
a
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
it
assumes
that
arguendo,
i
would
say
your
honor.
to
return
to
the
construction
of
the
special
verdict,
the
important
thing
here
is
that
the
jury
did
not
know
that
to
find
negligence
it
must
also
find
foreseeability.
the
only
instruction
given
to
it,
defining
negligence
was
the
definition
stating
simply
that
negligence
is
the
failure
to
exercise,
due
care
or
the
care
which
would
be
exercised
by
persons
of
ordinary
prudence.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes
sir.
we
requested
several
and
several
were
given
but
they
were
instructions
which
dealt
with
the
question
of
foreseeability
pure
and
simple.
that
is
for
example
that
hindsight
could
not
enter
into
it
but
only
--
the
only
consequences
which
could
be
reasonably
foreseen
by
persons
in
the
position
of
respondent
and
so
on.
that
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
was
involved
in
the
definition
of
foreseeability
but
there
was
no
linking
instruction
and
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
we
did
not
your
honor.
we
felt
it
was
unnecessary
because
by
the
very
nature
of
a
special
verdict
none
was
required.
the
jury
is
--
was
instructed
to
find
and
give
answers
to
specific
questions
and
general
propositions
of
law
were
not
proper
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
i
make
no
complain
about
the
instructions
your
honor.
i
merely
point
out
that
the
jury
didn't
know
what
the
relationship
was.
therefore,
the
--
in
following
this
court's
rules
which
require
that
every
reasonable
intendment
be
given
to
try
and
harmonize
and
give
effect
to
all
of
the
features,
all
of
the
passage
of
a
special
verdict
in
applying
that
rule
it
is
necessary
to
try
and
see
what
the
jury
really
meant
and
to
give
effect
to
each
and
every
one
of
the
findings.
i
submit
therefore
that
in
view
of
the
general
instruction
given
to
the
jury
on
the
term
“negligence”
namely
failure
to
exercise
due
care,
that
and
nothing
more
and
on
the
two
sentences
of
an
oral
instruction.
it
is
most
probable
it
seems
to
us
that
what
the
jury
was
in
effect
saying
when
it
said
that
respondent
was
negligent
because
it
permitted
a
stagnant
pool
and
then
animals
to
exist
on
its
property.
although,
no
risk
was
--
of
harmless
foreseeable
there
from
was
merely
that
this
particular
location
which
indeed
is
not
a
garden
spot
and
we
make
no
secret
to
that.
it
could've
been
cleaned
up.
it
must
have
(inaudible)
--
presented
perhaps
a
clean
air,
pleasanter,
more
attractive
place
for
respondent
to
work.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
is
the
only
view
of
this
special
verdict
under
which
all
of
its
particular
parts
and
all
of
the
answers
to
the
various
questions
can
be
made
a
uniform
whole.
petitioner
does
not
suggest
and
has
not
to
date
and
cannot
now
suggest
any
other
view
of
this
verdict
which
favors
anybody
which
gives
effect
to
all
parts
of
the
verdict.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes
sir.
that
is
to
say
a
case
went
to
the
jury?
was
given
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
--
to
the
jury
to
decide?
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
that
they
were
erroneously
instructed
on
the
question
of
foreseeability?
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
no
sir.
i
don't
think
they
were
insufficiently
instructed.
i
merely
say
that
their
findings
had
to
be
read
in
the
context
of
the
instructions
which
were
given.
and
in
attempting
to
reach
a
conclusion,
a
rational
conclusion
as
to
what
the
jury
meant,
you
have
to
look
up
at
the
instructions
and
the
answers
given
to
the
questions
one
as
a
uniform
whole.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
well,
there
is
no
question
urged
upon
this
court
at
this
time.
questions
have
been
made
in
the
courts
below
but
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
--
not
presented
here.
that's
correct.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
determining
my
considerations
of
a
special
verdict,
i
would
like
to
say
that
since
the
most
specific
finding
was
what
--
findings
were
findings
which
were
favorable
to
respondent
and
since
the
general
spirit
both
of
the
federal
rules
and
of
the
ohio
procedural
statutes
affecting
interpretation
of
verdicts
since
both
of
those
in
effect
require
that
the
special
findings,
the
more
specific
findings
prevail
over
the
general,
it
is
our
position
that
this
special
verdict
and
the
findings
of
lack
of
foreseeability
requires
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
be
affirmed.
however,
let
me
add
that
if
the
court
should
differ
with
us
on
that
contention
and
then
on
that
event
this
respondent
railroad
without
any
question
whatsoever
be
entitled
to
a
new
trial
at
which
findings
would
be
returned
which
would
present
a
uniform
whole
in
which
no
inconsistencies
were
present.
thus
although
we
had
contended,
we
are
entitled
to
final
judgment
on
a
special
verdict
that
we
also
feel
at
a
new
trial
at
the
very
least
is
owed
us.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes,
it's
on
page
626
of
the
record.
the
paragraph
reads
as
follows.
we
can
with
reason
say
that
to
maintain
for
a
period
of
years
stagnant,
vermin
and
infested
pool
of
water
on
and
over
which
insects
gather
on
property
where
its
employees
are
required
to
work
could
furnish
the
gravamen
of
it
--
an
offense
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
well,
that's
my
interpretation
of
it
your
honor.
i
didn't
say
that
in
so
many
words,
no.
but
i
--
to
me
that
means
it
could,
we
don't
necessarily
agree
that
it
did
but
we
pass
the
question,
we're
going
to
the
question
of
causation.
perhaps
i'm
wrong
and
if
you
read
it
differently
i
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
that's
the
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
that's
the
interpretation
i
placed
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
--
from
the
language.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes
sir.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
alright,
i
pass
now
to
the
question
of
the
record
evidence
of
negligence
which
in
the
first
instance
where
this
determined
the
question
whether
or
not
the
case
should
go
to
the
jury.
petitioner
had
vacillated
somewhat
in
his
theory
of
the
case
and
we've
had
some
difficulty
understanding
just
what
his
theory
of
the
case
is.
as
originally
pleaded
and
as
tried,
this
case
was
presented
on
the
theory
that
the
alleged
unsanitary
conditions
on
respondent's
property
attracted
an
insect
and
that
the
insect
bit
the
petitioner
as
a
direct
and
proximate
consequence
of
those
conditions
and
that
he
has
this
disease
as
a
result.
to
me,
it's
absolutely
indispensably
essential
to
that
line
of
proof
that
the
assumption
that
a
biting
insect
was
attracted.
now
however
in
this
court
in
his
reply
brief
and
i
think
for
the
first
time
petitioner
concedes
and
he
says
the
presence
of
an
unidentified
insects
does
not
imply
danger
and
that
the
real
gist
of
his
complaint
and
his
cause
of
action
is
that
there
were
unsanitary
conditions
on
the
property
just
that
and
nothing
more.
respondent
felt
at
the
time
of
trial
and
continuous
to
feel
that
there
must
be
three
conditions
which
coalesce
three
essentials
to
cause
of
action
such
as
this
negligent
of
transmission
of
disease
as
it
were.
first,
that
there
was
a
probable
source
of
a
medically
known
disease
or
infection
on
the
premises
and
that
respondent
was
unnoticed
of
that
through
the
notoriety
of
the
disease
or
infection
whatever
it
may
be.
second,
that
there
was
a
known
means
of
transmission
upon
which
respondent
was
unnoticed
of
the
existence
of
it,
whether
an
insect
or
anything
else.
if
an
insect
is
essential,
a
biting
insect,
that's
one
thing.
if
not,
there
must
be
shown
something
else
from
which
it
could
be
reasonably
anticipated
by
respondent
that
these
property
conditions
gave
rise
to
a
risk
of
harm
of
some
sort
to
its
employees.
finally,
there
must
be
some
evidence
or
some
rational
basis
to
infer
for
the
jury
that
both
the
disease
or
the
infection
or
the
lack
of
sanitation
or
whatever
phrase
used
to
describe
it
and
the
means
of
transmission
could
by
some
reasonable
means
available
to
the
railroad
company
have
been
either
eliminated
or
reduced
or
in
some
manners
materially
controls
the
risk
of
harm
to
employee
was
lessened.
obviously,
those
three
things
are
essential.
they
doesn't
know
--
no
railroad
company
can
be
charged
with
the
duty
of
keeping
its
premises
immaculately
claimed.
we
know
and
there's
evidence,
abundant
evidence
in
this
case
that
there
are
microorganisms,
potentially
infectious
microorganisms
which
are
present
everywhere.
they
are
present
in
this
courtroom.
they're
present
on
everybody's
body.
they're
present
in
the
pool
but
they're
all
also
ubiquitous
and
nothing
anybody
can
do
or
could
ever
try
to
do
to
--
could
get
rid
of
all
of
them.
the
same
thing
of
course
applies
to
insects.
insects
are
everywhere,
we
know
all
about.
the
numbers
of
them,
there
are
millions
and
millions
of
them
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
species
of
them.
many
of
them
are
not
harmful.
many
of
them
are
beneficial
to
mankind.
nothing
that
anybody
can
do,
can
eradicate
insect
life
and
in
the
second
place
nobody
would
want
to
do
that,
just
to
hog
anywhere.
thus,
the
only
insect
life
and
the
only
microorganisms,
bacteria
and
(inaudible)
--
and
whatnot
which
reasonable
care
imposes
a
duty
to
remove
are
those
which
are
harmful
and
those
which
reasonable
care
can
eradicate,
reasonable
meth
--
means.
now,
what
is
the
evidence
of
record
pertinent
to
these
questions?
first
is
as
to
insect
life.
the
only
insects
identified
by
name
in
this
record
are
ants,
flies,
mosquitoes,
sand
fleas
and
canadian
soldiers,
the
latter
two
are
seasonal
little
harmless
bugs
that
flying
off
lake
erie
of
the
cleveland
in
the
spring.
those
are
the
only
names
of
insects
which
are
--
appear
in
this
record.
none
of
them
except
mosquitoes
can
be
thought
of
as
--
that
are
--
none
of
them
except
mosquitoes
are
harmful
to
man.
none
of
them
habitually
attack
human
beings.
it's
doubtful
that
mosquitoes
can
be
said
to
cause
legal
harm.
they
do
bite
as
we
all
know
but
in
northern
ohio,
as
i
think
this
record
demonstrates,
there
is
no
history
of
malaria
or
yellow
fever
or
any
of
the
well
known
insect
mosquito-borne
diseases.
petitioner
in
this
case
did
say
that
his
testimony
on
this
point
being
somewhat
contradictory
that
he
had
seen
on
previous
occasions
insects
two
inches
long
and
described
it
as
the
width
of
his
three
fingers
and
a
half
of
inch
in
diameter
about
this
big
around
as
his
little
finger
that
being
the
size
which
he
felt
inside
his
pant
leg
when
he
flapped
his
leg.
he
didn't
see
insects
of
that
size
on
the
dead
hives
as
he
called
them
which
were
in
the
pool.
now,
as
to
those,
there
is
no
testimony
whatever
as
to
the
fact
that
any
insects
of
that
size
are
known
to
be
of
a
harmful
nature
or
propensity
to
attack
human
beings
in
northern
ohio.
there
is
no
showing
whatsoever
in
this
record
that
any
insects
or
any
harmful
nature
whatsoever
would
be
attracted
by
conditions
under
this
bridge.
the
record
evidence
is
entirely
to
the
contrary.
the
record
evidence
is
coming
from
the
only
expert,
entomologist,
who
testified
in
this
case
and
he
testified
on
our
behalf.
he
said
that
the
only
insects
attracted
by
the
conditions
under
this
bridge
would
be
mosquitoes
in
the
first
instance.
and
no
mosquito
is
involved
in
this
case
considerably.
mosquitoes
and
certain
forms
of
carry-on
or
varying
beetles
which
crawl
their
way
into
the
dead
animal
life
and
consume
it,
those
insects
he
said
would
not
bite
and
would
not
sting
human
beings.
there
is
no
evidence
that
these
premises
would
attract
any
insect
which
would
attack
human
beings.
it's
true
that
petitioner's
doctors
hypothesized
in
their
answer
to
the
hypothetical
question
that
some
insects
would
be
attracted
by
the
conditions
on
the
premises.
all
of
them,
both
of
the
doctors
however
repeatedly
and
wholeheartedly
conceded
that
they
had
no
expert
information
or
knowledge
about
insect
life
and
their
conclusions
with
respect
to
what
insects
would
be
attracted
are
therefore
without
anyway
whatever.
now,
if
petitioner's
theory
at
the
present
time
be
accepted
that
lack
of
sanitation
without
insects
be
accepted
as
a
sufficient
basis
for
the
case
to
go
to
the
jury,
let
us
just
look
at
that
intention
for
a
moment.
petitioner
says
that
merely
the
existence
of
these
property
conditions
without
any
expert
testimony
whatsoever
are
sufficient
to
--
for
a
lay
jury
to
conclude
that
risk
of
health
or
risk
to
the
health
of
employees
would
be
--
would
result.
but
that
is
not
this
case.
there
is
record
evidence.
there
is
record
expert
evidence
from
both
petitioner's
doctors
and
ours
as
to
what
health
risks
were
presented
by
the
conditions
under
this
bridge.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
only
testimony
which
in
anyway
can
be
said
to
support
a
conclusion
by
the
jury
of
lack
of
sanitation
being
a
risk
to
employees
consist
of
one
answer
given
by
one
of
petitioner's
doctors
to
a
question
asked
on
cross
examination.
he
was
asked,
“doctor,
how
do
you
reach
the
conclusion?
how
do
you
justify
your
conclusion
that
there
is
a
connection
between
the
property
conditions,
the
presence
of
the
insect,
the
bite
of
the
insect
and
the
petitioner's
disease?”
that
was
one
question
which
was
answered,
“yes,
i
have
that
opinion.”
and
he
said,
“well,
we
know
that
there
are
certain
recognized
diseases
which
conditions
of
this
sort
enhance
the
growth
of.”
alright,
doctor
what
are
those
conditions?
the
only
conditions,
the
only
diseases
which
he
was
able
to
respond
are
plague,
bubonic
plague
caused
by
rats
in
the
middle
ages
and
malaria.
there
is
no
--
not
--
one
other
word
of
testimony
in
this
record
to
confirm
what
risk
of
health
--
risk
to
health
was
presented
by
these
property
conditions.
in
further
cross
examination
of
both
doctors
it
was
developed
that
their
reasoning
process
goes
something
like
this.
it's
a
syllogism
major
or
minor
premise
and
a
supposed
conclusion.
they
say
we
recognize
that
certain
diseases,
certain
recognized
diseases
are
enhanced,
their
possibilities
of
developing
are
enhanced
by
conditions
such
as
for
present
respondent's
premises.
that's
the
major
premise
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
neither
of
those
recognized
diseases
has
ever
been
known
nor
has
any
incident
of
this
sort
ever
originated
near
this
property
before
nor
since.
the
minor
premise
is
--
petitioner
suffers
from
a
disease
of
unknown
origin,
having
no
understood
medical
cause,
a
disease
entirely
unprecedented
for
which
there
is
not
one
precedent
in
any
medical
literature
whatsoever.
he
suffers
from
this
disease
which
he
--
which
had
its
onset
at
the
time
when
he
was
present
near
this
stagnant
pool.
therefore,
the
doctor
says,
“there
is
a
direct
causal
connection
between
the
filth
and
the
pool
and
this
unknown
disease.”
there
are
--
in
a
number
of
reasons
why
that
reasoning
process
is
unsound
and
must
be
disregarded
and
overturned.
in
the
first
place,
as
i
have
already
observed
the
testimony
is
heavy
in
this
record
that
microorganisms,
that
the
only
microorganisms
which
would
be
present
in
this
particular
pool
are
the
same
identical
microorganisms
which
are
present
on
everybody's
body.
the
testimony
is
that
in
inside
our
bodies
and
on
the
outside
the
same
types
of
bacteria
are
present
which
would
be
present
in
the
pool.
the
doctors
have
ruled
out
all
of
these
microorganisms
as
a
possible
cause
of
petitioner's
illness.
they
simply
do
not
know
what
causes
his
illness.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes
sir.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes
sir.
he
got
a
bite
about
two
inches
above
his
knee
and
the
back
of
his
knee,
inside
his
pant
leg.
i
don't
have
the
chronology
of
it
exactly
in
mind
but
in
general
is
this
that
that
night
he
noted
a
swelling
there
which
he
couldn't
see
i
don't
believe
because
it
was
of
its
location
that
it
continued
to
grow
in
size.
it
formed
a
pus
head,
sometime
of
--
a
matter
of
days
or
perhaps
a
week
later,
that
got
broke.
he
went
to
a
doctor,
doctor
heller
who
testified
that
when
he
went
there,
when
he
saw
him
the
first
time
he
did
see
him,
the
wound
had
the
appearance
of
a
staphylococci
lesion
that
is
simply
a
boil,
like
any
other
boil.
there
was
no
testimony
whatever
that
from
any
doctor
that
connected
the
type
of
injury,
the
type
of
wounds
sustained
by
this
man
from
the
bite
with
the
bite
itself.
there
was
nothing
characteristic
of
it
to
indicate
that
it
came
from
a
bite.
it
looked
like
a
staphylococcus.
it
looked
like
something
that
anybody
could
get
if
--
through
a
hair
follicle
or
in
shaving
or
whatever,
a
boil
which
would
form
and
pus
would
come
out
of
it.
that
was
--
that's
the
general
nature
of
the
testimony
relating
to
the
origin
of
the
bite,
your
honor.
there
is,
i
might
add,
that
it
is
affirmatively
demonstrated
that
staphylococcus
which,
as
i
say,
was
doctor
heller's
initial
impression
what
was
the
cause
of
this
--
of
his
lesion.
the
testimony
is
that
through
subsequent
test
that
has
been
ruled
out
as
the
cause
of
his
disease.
all
other
known
organism,
microorganisms
had
also
been
ruled
out
as
a
cause
of
his
disease.
the
doctor
simply
don't
know
what
this
man
has.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
i
don't
believe
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
i
don't
believe
it
ever
did
heal
up.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
it
grew
larger
and
then
within
about
two
months
he
started
to
get
other
wounds
of
similar
nature
on
other
parts
of
his
body
where
there
was
no
history
of
any
insect
bite.
those
came
and
went
into
--
his
progress
has
been
one
of
partial
and
momentary
remission
and
followed
by
cases
of
an
unsaid
of
the
disease
which
get
primarily
got
deeper
and
deeper
and
it
got
to
the
tendons
of
his
legs
upon
the
--
there
was
no
hope
of
saving
the
legs
or
any
usefulness
of
them
and
they
were
cut
off.
the
source
formed
at
various
parts
of
his
bodies,
his
body
with
no
history
of
how
they
start
or
why
they
start.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
he
had
--
his
history
was
so
far
as
he
knew
without
any
exception
prior
to
the
time
of
this
bite.
however,
in
that
--
in
the
record
there
was
--
in
the
record
there
is
testimony,
mr.
justice
clark,
that
to
the
effect
that
the
probable
real
diagnosis
of
this
man's
illness
not
well
understood
and
highly
theoretical
at
the
present
moment
so
far
as
the
medical
profession
is
concerned
that
the
real
cause
of
it
is
the
fact
that
he
is
a
man
who
has
a
hyper-allergy
as
they
call
it.
this
is
something
of
peculiar
sensitivity
to
infection
that
no
doctor
can
understand
why
it's
there,
why
it
develops
at
one
particular
time.
on
the
matter
of
causation,
i
would
like
to
say
one
or
two
words
though
my
time
is
limited.
petitioner's
testimony
or
theory
is
that
not
only
that
it
was
foreseeable
that
this
particular
property
condition
gave
rise
to
a
risk
of
--
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
thank
you
sir.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
petitioners
contends
not
only
that
it
was
foreseeable
that
a
risk
of
harm
to
health
of
employees
would
be
created
by
these
unsanitary
conditions
not
only
that
but
he
contends
that
he
actually
did
come
from
this
particular
pool.
the
record
is
plain.
we
believe
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
any
such
conclusion
whatsoever.
there
is
no
rational
basis.
this
court
has
said
so
many
times
that
it
has
to
be
concluded
with
reason
by
the
jury
that
the
negligence
was
the
cause
of
the
illness.
that
is
not
present
on
this
record.
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
