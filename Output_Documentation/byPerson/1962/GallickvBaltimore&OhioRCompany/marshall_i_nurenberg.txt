mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
senior
counsel
on
this
case
for
the
petitioner,
mr.
a.h.
dudnik
very
much
wanted
to
address
the
court
but
unfortunately
is
confined
to
a
hospital
in
cleveland
having
underwent
major
surgery
but
i'm
going
to
do
my
best
to
substitute
as
associate
counsel
on
the
case.
now,
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
cuyahoga
county,
ohio.
it
is
an
action
brought
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
section
51
through
60
as
amended.
the
case
was
tried
to
a
jury
in
the
state
court
of
general
jurisdiction
namely
the
court
of
common
pleas
of
cuyahoga
county.
it
was
tried
upon
a
special
verdict
statute
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
ohio
which
actually
had
only
been
amended
approximately
a
year
before
this
case
was
tried.
now,
i
would
like
if
i
may
before
getting
in
to
what
i
concede
to
be
the
real
issue
in
this
case
to
briefly
discuss
what
the
jury
did
find
under
the
special
verdict
statute
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
evidence
did
support
so
that
i
can
then
go
into
what
i
consider
the
prime
question
in
this
case
and
that
is
what
we
claimed
to
be
the
fundamental
error
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
holding
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
jury
in
the
case
found
a
causal
relationship
between
the
negligence
which
the
jury
found
and
the
injuries
to
the
petitioner
which
the
jury
found
that
such
finding
of
causal
relationship
said
the
court
of
appeals
or
reasons
which
i
will
get
in
to
in
just
a
moment
is
not
supported
by
the
evidence,
but
would
require
the
jury
to
indulge
in
speculation
and
conjecture
and
therefore
the
court
of
common
pleas
instead
of
submitting
the
case
to
the
jury
in
the
first
place
should
have
directed
a
verdict
for
the
respondent.
and
therefore
the
court
of
appeals
upon
a
statute
of
the
state
of
ohio
entered
that
judgment
which
it
said
the
court
of
common
pleas
should've
entered
for
the
respondent
namely
a
final
judgment
for
the
respondent.
and
the
court
of
--
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
refused
to
review
the
case
under
appropriate
statutes
and
constitutional
provisions
of
the
state
of
ohio
thereby
making
that
judgment
final
and
permitting
us
to
perfect
our
petition
for
a
writ
to
this
court.
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
it
was
--
actually,
there
were
16
grounds
of
error
asserted
by
the
respondent
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
included
among
others
the
refusal
of
the
court
of
common
pleas
to
grant
its
motion
for
a
directed
verdict.
the
refusal
of
the
court
of
common
pleas
to
enter
judgment
for
the
respondent
railroad
on
the
verdict
of
the
jury
being
a
special
verdict
which
the
respondent
claimed
entitled
him
the
judgment
and
upon
the
refusal
of
a
court
of
common
pleas
to
grant
a
new
trial
to
the
respondent
for
what
it
claimed
for
certain
errors
and
trial
procedure.
the
other
assignments
are
very
basically
are
encompass
within
those.
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
only
on
--
and
this
is
very
important,
only
on
the
single
ground
that
the
court
of
common
pleas
erred
in
not
directing
a
verdict
for
respondent.
this
--
and
i
want
to
emphasize,
this
is
terribly
important.
this
is
not
one
of
those
cases
where
the
court
below
having
decided
the
case
on
one
ground
which
would
be
sufficient
to
what
to
--
adjudge
the
case,
found
it
unnecessary
to
consider
other
points
of
error.
the
court
of
appeals
in
both
its
opinion
and
in
its
general
entry
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
that
it
considered
each
and
every
amount
of
error
which
was
asserted
by
the
respondent.
and
the
only
one
of
those
grounds
of
error
said
the
court
of
appeals
which
we
find
prejudicial
to
the
rights
of
respondent
is
the
refusal
of
the
court
of
--
what
the
refusal
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
to
direct
the
verdict.
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
precisely
--
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
that
is
precisely
our
position
mr.
justice.
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
if
we
don't
prevail,
we
(inaudible).
it's
in
the
plain
language.
in
other
words,
there's
a
final
judgment
against
us
and
if
this
court
does
not
see
our
point
of
view
and
reverse
the
judgment
and
reinstate
the
judgment
which
the
court
of
common
pleas
entered
for
the
petitioner
then
of
course
the
petitioner
is
completely
exhausted
all
possible
remedies
and
there'll
be
a
final
judgment
before
the
requirement.
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
no,
there
is
not,
mr.
justice
harlan.
now,
if
i
may
i
want
to
talk
about
that
special
verdict
for
just
a
minute.
now,
up
until
the
time
that
the
special
verdict
statute
of
the
state
of
ohio
was
amended
as
i
say
was
approximately
a
year
before
this
case
was
decided,
the
special
verdict
statute
in
the
state
of
ohio
provided
that
the
jury
was
to
find
questions
of
fact
and
from
those
findings
of
questions
of
fact,
the
trial
judge
was
to
draw
the
necessary
conclusions
of
law
and
then
to
enter
the
judgment
which
should
be
rendered.
that
statute
was
amended
before
this
case
was
tried
and
the
case
was
tried
under
the
amended
statute
and
the
statute
as
amended
said
that
it
would
be
the
function
of
the
jury
to
try
the
determinative
issues
in
the
case
and
so
that
all
that
would
remain
to
be
done
by
the
trial
judge
would
be
to
enter
judgment.
and
the
amended
statute
removed
therefore
from
the
functions
of
the
trial
judge
the
duty
of
drawing
the
conclusions
of
law.
now,
there's
no
dispute
in
this
case
at
all
but
that
there
is
no
issue
of
contributory
negligence.
that
case
--
that
question
is
not
even
in
the
case.
so
that
under
section
51,
the
only
determinative
issues
which
could
possibly
be
present
in
this
federal
employers'
liability
act
case
would
be;
(a)
was
the
respondent
negligent?
and
(b)
did
such
negligence
in
whole
or
in
part
cause
injury
to
the
petitioner?
there
are
no
other
determinative
issues
which
could
possibly
be
tried
to
the
jury.
but
the
trial
court
nevertheless
submitted
several
ancillary
questions
to
the
jury
dealing
with
factual
problem.
but
the
jury
did
specifically
find
and
one
of
the
questions
asked
the
jury
is
--
was
and
it
was
question
16
on
the
special
verdict.
was
the
respondent
negligent
in
one
of
more
of
the
particulars
alleged
in
the
petition
to
which
the
jury
answered,
“yes”.
and
then
they
asked
question
17,
in
what
respect
was
the
respondent
negligent?
and
the
jury
said,
“in
causing
on
his
property
or
permitting
to
exist
on
his
property
a
pool
--
and
i
may
not
be
quoting
it
exactly,
this
is
the
open
and
close,
--
“a
pool
of
stagnant
water
into
which
were
permitted
to
accumulate
dead
pigeons,
dead
rats
and
bugs
and
vermin
of
various
sorts”.
and
then
the
jury
was
asked
in
other
questions
in
the
special
verdict,
“did
acts
or
omissions
of
the
respondent
proximately
contribute
to
cause
injury
to
the
petitioner?”
and
the
jury
answered,
“yes.”
and
they
were
asked
whether
there
was
a
proximate
causal
of
relationship
in
any
--
or
in
the
slightest
degree
and
again
the
jury
answered,
“yes.”
now,
the
respondent
has
argued
vigorously
however
that
the
jury
was
also
asked
the
question
whether
the
respondent
could
foresee
that
its
property
conditions
which
are
the
substance
of
this
action,
the
maintaining
of
a
pool
of
stagnant
water
with
all
these
vermin
adjacent
to
which
the
petitioner
was
required
to
work
whether
the
respondent
could
foresee
that
these
would
cause
injury
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
and
that
is,
i
think
question
21.
now,
let
me
--
what?
what
(inaudible)
question
20
and
this
question
is
quite
important.
i
want
to
talk
to
you
--
talk
about
that
for
a
moment.
it's
noted
--
it's
on
the
record
on
page
13
and
it's
known
as
exhibit
t,
or
question
20.
there
was
another
question
on
foreseeability
too
and
that
is
question
22
but
the
question
22
i
think
we
can
dispose
of
in
a
hurry
because
that
was
whether
they
could
foresee
the
present
physical
condition
of
the
petitioner
and
what
happen
is
that
he
developed
this
ulceration
which
ultimately
spreads
throughout
his
body
literally
ate
his
legs
away
from
gangrene
so
that
after
four
years
in
a
hospital,
it
was
necessary
to
amputate
both
of
his
legs
above
the
knee.
but
i
think
the
law
is
abundantly
clear
that
a
defendant
in
a
law
--
in
a
negligence
action
does
not
have
to
foresee
the
end
result.
so
that
that
question
i
don't
think
is
particularly
significant
but
i
want
to
go
back
to
question
20
for
this
reason.
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
yes,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
will.
let
me
get
to
question
13
right
now.
yes.
did
the
jury
find
a
safe
place
in
which
to
work
and
they
said
they
cannot
answer
this
question.
i
would
say
on
that
at
the
outset
that
a
similar
question
was
presented
to
this
court
sometime
ago
in
another
case
from
our
office
actually
called
harris
versus
pennsylvania
railroad
company
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
its
361
u.s.15.
in
that
case
which
was
a
general
verdict
for
the
petitioner,
the
jury
likewise
could
not
answer
that
question.
but
in
another
question,
the
jury
did
find
specific
negligence
and
this
court
held
in
a
per
curiam
opinion
where
there
was
no
oral
argument
simply
that
the
decision
of
the
jury
was
in
line
with
the
well
known
rogers
case
reversed
a
judgment
for
the
respondent
and
reinstated
the
judgment
for
the
petitioner.
in
this
case,
although
the
jury
did
not
answer
that
particular
question,
the
jury
did
find
specific
negligence
in
one
or
more
the
respects
claimed
in
--
claim
in
petition
--
in
the
petition.
and
since
the
only
other
specification
besides
the
general
count
of
unsafe
place
to
work
that
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
only
other
one
was
specification
of
negligence
number
6
in
the
petition
which
may
be
found
in
the
record
on
page
2
or
page
3
and
that
specification
is
retaining
--
pertaining
to
respondent
and
that
it
knew
that
by
permitting
said
pool
of
stagnant
water
to
accumulate
dead
pigeons,
rats,
bugs
and
vermin,
insects
would
be
attracted
to
said
area
and
that
his
employers
would
have
to
work
under
unhealthful
and
unsanitary
conditions.
and
we
maintained
that
in
substance
when
the
jury
answer
question
17,
that's
what
they
had
in
mind.
now
getting
back
to
question
20,
the
question
was,
if
the
answer
is
to
any
one,
any
one
of
the
questions
number
1,
5,
6,
7,
and
8
is
yes,
was
there
any
reason
to
foresee?
now,
this
i
think
is
very
important
because
the
way
the
trial
judge
submitted
the
question
to
the
jury,
he
never
asked
the
jury
if
you
can
conceive
of
a
collective
situation.
in
other
words,
all
of
these
things
be
present
at
one
time,
dead
rats,
dead
pigeons,
pool
of
stagnant
water
and
insects
and
requiring
the
petitioner
to
work
there
would
that
create
a
condition
where
it
could
be
reasonably
foreseen
that
the
petitioner
would
be
subject
to
harm.so
that
the
jury
could
very
well
have
answered
question
20
by
simply
saying
when
they
said,
no,
just
one
of
these
conditions
alone
wouldn't
be
enough.
you
have
to
have
them
all
there
together
and
in
fact
the
jury
did
find
them
all
there
together
in
question
number
17.
and
i
think
this
--
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
what's
that?
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
question
number
17?
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
question
number
13.
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
it's
--
well,
let's
put
it
this
way.
i
--
my
only
criticism
of
question
13
and
remember
under
the
statute
by
the
way,
the
lawyers
don't
draw
the
questions
the
judge
does.
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
i
think
it's
a
little
bit
vague
and
could
very
well
have
been
confusing
to
the
jury
whereas
question
16
and
17
were
completely
clear
to
the
jury
and
i
don't
think
--
in
my
humble
judgment
that
there
was
any
question
but
that
the
jury
intended
to
find
negligence,
did
find
negligence
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
his
decision
conceded
that
jury
found
negligence.
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
reasonable
care.
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
reasonable
care
or
ordinary
care.
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
right
mr.
justice
stewart.
right.
now,
i
want
to
talk
if
i
may
again
about
question
20
for
this
reason.
not
too
long
ago,
this
court
decided
a
case
called
ellerim
--
now,
it
was
the
ellerman
lines
case
and
i
got
it
cited
on
one
of
the
briefs.
but
anyway,
the
question
there
is
very
similar
to
what
we
have
here
and
that's
what
i
want
to
talk
about
for
a
minute.
in
that
case,
it
was
an
action
by
a
shipowner
against
a
stevedoring
company
seeking
reimbursement
under
what
it
claimed
was
the
breach
of
the
stevedoring
contract
requiring
the
stevedoring
company
the
use
actually
the
utmost
care
in
unloading
the
vessel.
and
in
that
particular
case,
what
had
happened
was
that
as
the
burlap
bags
which
are
around
--
had
certain
bands
around
were
being
unloaded.
one
of
the
bands
snapped
and
fell
and
it
seriously
injured
the
petitioner
who
recovered
on
a
general
negligence
action.
and
then
the
ship
company
brought
suit
for
indemnity
against
the
stevedoring
company
by
whom
petitioner
was
employed.
and
the
jury
in
answer
to
special
questions
found
negligence
but
it
also
found
in
answer
to
a
special
question
that
the
stevedoring
company
had
complied
in
all
respects
with
its
contract.
now
the
court
of
appeals,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
said
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
these
were
inconsistent
answers
because
in
order
for
the
accident
to
happen
that
way
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
stevedoring
company
had
to
breach
its
contract.
therefore,
it
disregarded
the
finding
by
the
jury
and
substituted
its
own
finding
thereby
reaching
a
different
result
from
the
jury
did.
but
this
court
held
that
that
overlooked
the
fact
that
if
advanced
around
the
burlap
bag
broke
this
would
be
consistent
with
the
warranty
of
unseen
worthiness
which
would
make
all
of
the
answers
consistent.
and
it
was
the
duty
of
the
court
whenever
possible
to
try
to
reconcile
all
of
the
answers
and
make
them
consistent.
so
applying
that
same
line
of
rational
to
this
case
i
say
that
when
the
jury
finds
negligence,
when
the
jury
finds
causal
relationship
and
the
question
is
put
to
the
jury
in
question
20
merely
says
anyone
and
omits
presenting
to
the
jury
the
question
of
the
collective
situation
that
that
answer
can
therefore
be
reconciled
with
the
answers
to
questions
16
and
17.
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
yes
sir,
mr.
--
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
i
think
there
was
although
i'm
not
completely
positive
offhand.
i
think
there
was.
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
finding
by
the
jury
generally
of
negligence
on
the
general
issue
would
be
an
equivalent
to
a
general
verdict
of
the
other
questions
with
deal
again
with
--
be
treated
similar
to
interrogatories.
now,
the
real
question
as
i
see
it
thought
in
this
particular
case
and
by
the
way
before
i
leave
that
last
point,
the
respondent
in
its
last
brief
to
this
court
stated
that
the
jury
was
never
charged
on
foreseeability.
this
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
record.
on
page
5,
17,
18
and
19,
the
trial
court
very
thoroughly
charged
the
jury
on
the
issue
of
foreseeability
in
relation
to
negligence.
in
special
charges
of
writing
prepared
by
the
respondent
itself
because
under
ohio
law
a
lawyer
has
a
right
to
submit
charges
and
writing
to
be
given
by
the
court
and
if
these
charges
are
correct
they
must
be
given
in
the
language
prepared
by
the
counsel
and
submitted
to
the
jury
in
writing.
and
the
general
charge
to
the
court
is
then
taken
to
be
in
pari
materia
with
the
special
charges
and
there
are
some
total
then
constitute
the
total
charge
of
the
court.
and
the
respondent
itself
prepared
questions
on
foreseeability
and
those
charges
were
given
by
the
trial
judge.
so
the
jury
did
have
them
and
it
is
not
correct
as
respondent
states
in
its
last
brief
that
the
jury
was
never
instructed
on
the
issue
of
foreseeability.
now,
what
the
court
of
appeals
found
and
this
is
very
interesting
to
me
was
not
that
there
could
not
be
a
causal
relationship
between
the
conditions
because
the
two
doctors
who
treated
the
petitioner
both
testified
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
there
was
a
causal
relationship,
a
medical
causal
relationship
between
the
disease
which
the
petitioner
ended
up
with
and
the
stagnant
pool
of
water
with
its
filthy
conditions
which
we
have
referred
to.
the
respondent's
doctor
took
the
position
that
there
was
no
causal
relationship
so
that
this
created
a
square
question
of
fact
we
contend
to
the
jury
which
was
resolved
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
not
that
there
could
not
be
a
causal
relationship
but
merely
that
there
were
also
other
places
where
the
contaminated
insect
could've
come
from
and
it
evolved
upon
the
petitioner
to
exclude
the
other
places
before
the
jury
had
a
right
to
say
that
it
came
from
this
place
although
you
have
here
--
and
this
is
the
picture
that
were
shown
to
the
jury,
a
pool
of
water
with
a
track
and
the
petitioner
is
standing
about
10
feet
away.
this
is
looking
through
the
south
and
it
--
and
all
the
witnesses
testified
that
for
many
years
there
were
accumulated
in
this
pool
of
water
and
he
worked
from
10
to
20
dead
or
dying
rats,
pigeons,
and
different
kinds
of
bugs
and
vermin
crawling
and
flying
all
around
this
area.
yet,
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
position
and
this
was
another
view
showing
the
same
thing.t
he
pool
of
water
which
leads
to
the
south
to
a
drainage
ditch
and
the
petitioner
was
standing
about
like
so.
but
despite
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
right
next
to
a
contaminating
source,
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
it
evolved
upon
the
petitioner
the
duty
of
looking
elsewhere
or
to
eliminate
looking
elsewhere
for
this
bug
or
this
insect.
and
if
i
may
draw
an
example
against
from
a
recent
decision
by
this
court
in
a
totally
different
type
of
situation
not
too
long
ago,
last
june,
this
court
was
confronted
with
a
problem
in
a
case
called
continental
ore
company
versus
union
carbide
corporation
where
the
court
of
appeals
held
--
the
lower
court
of
appeals
held
that
a
directed
verdict
on
causal
relationship
should
have
been
to
the
respondents
because
the
petitioner
failed
to
show
that
he
had
tried
up
all
the
other
sources
where
he
could've
gotten
this
ore.
in
other
words,
the
petitioner
didn't
show
that
he
had
made
seasonable
demand
for
such
ore
and
that
he
had
shown
that
all
other
source
--
if
he
hadn't
shown
that
all
other
sources
where
he
could
get
the
ore
besides
those
of
the
respondents
were
dried
up,
he
failed
to
meet
his
burden
on
causal
relationship.
and
this
court
held
that
no
such
burden
evolved
upon
the
petitioner
or
at
least
as
i
understand
it
that
would
be
a
question
for
the
jury
to
draw
the
inferences
and
not
the
court.
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
saying
that
a
directed
verdict
should
have
been
for
the
respondents
that
these
were
questions
of
facts
for
the
jury
and
yet
and
in
deciding
that
case,
this
court
cited
its
precedent,
the
tennant
case
which
of
course
is
one
of
the
leading
federal
employers'
liability
act
cases.
and
by
the
same
rational,
certainly
where
there
is
substantial
evidence,
remember
the
petitioner
testified
that
although
he
never
saw
this
insect
he
felt
what
was
a
hard
shelled
insect,
he
reported
to
his
claim
agent
that
he
was
bitten
by
an
insect
under
the
bridge
before
he
ever
had
a
lawyer
or
he
was
laying
sick
in
a
hospital
bed
that
it
was
described
as
being
a
hard
shelled
insect
about
two
inches
long
and
an
inch
in
diameter
that
he
had
seen
insects
that
fitted
that
description
crawling
on
these
dead
hives,
in
this
pool
of
stagnant
water
just
the
track
with
the
way.
there
was
no
testimony
that
any
such
situation
was
ever
seen
elsewhere
except
underneath
the
bridge
and
yet
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
petitioner
failed
to
meet
his
burden
on
causal
relationship
because
he
didn't
show
that
there
was
any
efficient
causal
relationship
between
the
conditions
under
the
bridge
and
the
petitioner's
injury
despite
the
fact
that
the
fela
provides
and
this
court
has
interpreted
it
in
the
rogers
case
as
providing
that
you
don't
have
to
show
any
efficient
causal
relationship.
you
merely
have
to
show
negligence
in
whole
or
in
part
and
as
a
producing
cause
of
a
petitioner's
injury.
so
that
where
we
are
left
now
and
why
we
have
asked
this
court
to
review
the
case
is
because
at
least
litigants
in
the
state
of
ohio
are
being
forced
to
litigate
this
class
of
case
under
an
impossible
burden.
well,
were
--
or
at
least
a
burden
which
is
totally
inconsistent
with
what
we
concede
to
be
the
interpretation
of
that
act
as
this
court
has
put
upon
it
time
and
time
again.
i
don't
know
how
much
time
i
have
left
but
this
is
a
--
how
much?
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
7
minutes.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
last
7
minutes
if
i
may.
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
they
stated
--
and
that
was
doctor
hipolito
and
doctor
anderson.
well,
let's
take
that
(inaudible)
first.
he
put
it
this
way.
that
in
his
opinion,
an
organism
of
some
sort
was
introduced
into
petitioner's
body
through
this
insect
bite
which
he
felt
as
an
expert
on
sanitation
problems
although
not
necessarily
an
expert
on
insects
of
necessity
was
related
to
the
pool
and
filthy
conditions
there
prevailing
and
that
medical
science
was
unable
to
properly
control
the
spread
of
this
disease
once
it
was
injected
into
petitioner's
body
which
resulted
in
his
debilitated
condition.
doctor
robin
anderson,
who
treated
this
man
for
two
years
at
the
cleveland
clinic,
in
cleveland,
ohio,
testified
--
to
use
his
words
and
perhaps
i
can
find
them
in
a
hurry,
because
i
hate
to
misquote
--
doctor
anderson
stated
answer
to
a
hypothetical
question,
“my
opinion
is
there
is
a
direct
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
man's
health,
the
insect
bite
and
the
stagnant
area.”
and
elsewhere
in
cross
examination,
doctor
anderson
stated
that
the
condition
of
the
man
in
his
medical
opinion
was
related
to
the
conditions
that
were
maintained
in
this
stagnant
pool
by
reason
of
the
filthy
condition
there
and
prevailing.
and
i
might
add
by
the
way,
the
last
thing
i
want
to
say
--
well,
that
comes
up
on
this
hypothetical
question
which
respondents
attack
in
their
brief,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
respondent
used
the
identical
hypothetical
question
to
their
own
doctor,
doctor
davis.
the
very
one
which
they
claimed
the
trial
court
should
not
have
permitted
us
to
ask,
their
doctor
answered
it
differently
than
our
doctor
did
or
i
should
say
the
treating
doctors
did.
and
that
of
course
created
that
square
issue
of
fact.
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
in
a
few
brief
moments
that
i
have
i
would
like
to
just
point
out
a
few
things.
number
one,
on
page
548
of
the
record
at
the
conclusion
of
the
charge
of
the
court,
so
that
there
is
no
misunderstanding
on
this.
the
court
asked
counsel
if
there
was
anything
further
that
he
was
charged
on
and
mr.
leasure
speaking
for
the
respondent
stated
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
we
do
not
have
any
request
for
an
additional
charge.
however,
i
want
to
save
my
exceptions.
and
the
law
in
ohio
was
clear
and
i
think
that's
the
law
generally
that
if
there
should
be
an
error
commissioned
and
i
don't
think
there
was
one
you
can't
take
advantage
of
it
if
you
don't
call
it
to
the
court's
attention.
and
we
do
repeat
contrary
to
this
--
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
that
means
that
if
there
is
an
error
of
commission
in
the
charge
that
if
the
judge
said
something
wrong
to
the
jury
when
he
did
say
which
could
be
precedentially
erroneous
then
he
would
be
entitled
--
the
party
objecting
would
be
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
but
if
there
was
only
an
error
of
commission
then
you
can't
find
that
error
in
the
upper
court.
so
at
best,
respondent's
argument
could
only
deal
with
an
error
commission
and
i
repeat
that
if
the
court
will
read
the
entire
charge
it's
given
before
argument
on
page
518,
it
will
find
that
the
jury
was
instructed
and
no
uncertain
terms
about
this
question
foreseeability
in
its
overall
relation
to
the
case.
and
i
do
claim
that
if
foreseeability
is
in
the
case
that
on
the
basis
that
i
gave
that
anyone
is
the
significant
answer
and
it
can't
be
reconciled
with
the
jury's
answers
to
the
specific
finding
of
negligence.
now,
i
would
like
to
read
if
i
may,
the
answer
of
doctor
robin
anderson
to
a
question
imposed
to
him
on
cross
examination
which
gives
a
fairly
good
chronology
and
it's
found
on
pages
260
and
261
of
the
record.
and
he
says,
the
man
had
met
--
i'm
skipping
the
first
paragraph
about
his
arm,
they
treated
him
and
he
had
a
history.
this
man
had
massive
ulcerative
disease
which
from
a
medical
standpoint
and
as
far
as
medical
evidence
is
concerned
can
be
traced
back
directly
to
something
related
to
a
bite
of
some
insect
which
was
observed
and
found
to
be
a
small
red
mark.
over
a
specific
period
of
time,
the
small
red
mark
increased
in
size.
at
the
end
of
six
or
seven
days,
this
red
mark
had
increase
to
something
much
longer
with
what
we
are
told
had
a
head
on
it.
and
we
must
assume
that
this
lesion
at
this
time
is
the
same
lesion
which
started
at
the
time
of
the
original
injury
and
i
might
say
parenthetically
that
that
was
well
verified
medically.
from
this
point
on,
their
study
progressed
all
of
which
is
verified
medically,
from
this
point
we
have
our
own
history
in
terms
of
the
record.
we
must
carry
our
basic
reasoning
back
one
step
further
and
that
is
at
the
presence
of
filth,
of
rats,
of
dead
vermin,
of
stagnant
water
predisposes
to
disease,
predisposes
to
the
growth
of
insects
and
the
like.
this
man
was
bitten
in
close
proximity
to
such
an
area
of
stagnant
filth
and
it
is
only
logical
that
we
must
assume
that
the
probability
is
there
that
whatever
it
was
and
the
insect
and
the
bug
is
related
to
the
presence
of
that
area
and
this
from
a
doctor
who
treated
this
man
for
two
years
at
the
cleveland
clinic
and
as
--
and
is
the
head
of
the
department
of
plastic
surgery
in
that
particular
institution
--
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
no,
that
was
an
answer
to
a
question
on
cross
examination
by
mr.
leasure
as
to
why
do
you
feel
doctor
anderson
that
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
stagnant
pool
of
water
and
the
ultimate
result.
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
and
it
relates
to
the
hypothetical
question
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
--
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
it
relates
to
that
question
--
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
--
as
to
why
he
gave
the
answer
that
he
did.
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
and
as
to
this
question
of
hyper-allergy,
no
doctor
testified
this
man
had
a
hyper-allergy.
respondent's
doctor,
doctor
davis
said
that
--
and
he
was
only
called
as
a
medical
expert
to
testify
hypothetically.
respondent's
doctor,
doctor
davis
testified
that
this
is
the
only
thing
i
can
say
to
explain
it
but
the
respondent
--
but
petitioner's
doctor
explained
it
differently.
they
related
the
fact
to
the
condition
complained
of.
if
i
got
just
another
moment
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
marshall
i.
nurenberg
the
only
other
thing
i
want
to
say
is
that
on
this
question
of
the
arnold
case
and
these
other
cases,
they
all
dealt
with
the
deprivation
of
federal
rights,
a
deprivation
of
the
right
to
trial
by
a
jury
in
finding
negligence
and
causation.
in
the
arnold
case,
the
jury
found
an
unsafe
place
to
work,
but
specifically
rejected
each
and
every
claim
of
negligence
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas
entered
a
final
judgment
for
the
respondent
on
the
claim
that
under
texas
procedure
this
was
mandatory.
and
this
court
held
that
when
a
jury
found
that
the
place
of
work
was
unsafe,
this
was
sufficient
to
warn
the
petitioner's
judgment
in
the
verdict.
but
here,
there
is
no
claim
of
a
deprivation
of
federal
rights.
respondents
had
its
trial
by
a
jury
and
any
questions
of
a
state
procedure
were
resolved
against
the
respondent.
and
so
all
that
remains
here
is
for
this
court
to
determine
whether
the
court
below
was
wrong
when
it
came
to
the
conclusion
that
defined
causal
relationship,
the
jury
would
have
to
have
indulged
in
speculation
and
conjecture
and
not
in
evidence.
thank
you
very
much.
