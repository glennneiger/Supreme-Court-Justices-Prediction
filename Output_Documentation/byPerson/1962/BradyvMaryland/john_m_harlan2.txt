justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
he
had,
had
--
brady
had,
had
this
statement
before
his
trial,
would
it
have
been
admissible
at
the
trial
on
the
issue
of
guilt?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words
under
your
law
jury
can
really
become
a
legislature
ad
hoc
and
say
we
don't
like
this
going
in
your
business,
and
we
won't
apply
it
to
anybody
who
didn't
pull
the
trigger,
that's
about
--
i
gather
that's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
more
of
a
legislature
i
would
say
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
the
statue
had
said
i
suppose,
this
is
a
felony
murder,
but
the
jury
if
it
wishes
can
confine
felony
murders
only
to
people
who
pull
the
trigger.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
many
states
of
the
union
have
got
this
kind
of
a
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
if
this
had
been
offered,
if
this
statement
had
been
available
and
had
been
offered
at
the
trial
of
brady,
would
it
have
been
admissible
for
all
purposes,
or
let
me
put
it
this
way,
could
the
state
have
objected
to
its
general
admissibility
and
said
it
should
be
limited
only
to
the
question
of
punishment
in
view
of
this
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
for
all
purposes?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
is
no
law
outside
of
this
opinion
in
maryland
on
this
kind
of
a
situation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
thomas,
yeah.
justice
john
m.
harlan
for
all
purposes?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
so,
the
way
i
read,
it
could
be.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
another
question
on
this
--
these
instructions
as
to
less
than
first
degree
murder,
less
than
felony
murder.
had
the
court
refused
to
give
those
instructions
on
this
record,
would
that
have
been
a
reversible
error
under
your
law?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
you
are
limiting
it
a
little
bit.
what
i'm
putting
to
you
is
this.
supposing
the
petitioner's
counsel
had
said
i
want
instructions
on
second
degree
murder,
et
cetera,
manslaughter,
the
judge
said
no,
because
the
evidence
in
this
record
is
uncontroverted,
that
this
man
was
guilty
of
a
felony
murder
and
therefore
a
verdict
of
that
kind
would
be
unsupported
by
evidence,
just
like
we
had
in
the
greene
case
up
here.
would
that
have
been
reversible
error,
to
give
an
instruction,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
specific
wording,
any
instruction
would
it
have
been
reversible
error?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
purpose
–
what
effect
it
would
give
it
to
the
provision
of
the
constitution?
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
into
your
constitution?
[inaudible]
something
duty
of
the
jury,
power
of
the
jury
to
go
beyond
what
it
already
had
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
in
a
case
of
jury
where
it
is
operating
under
[inaudible]
constitutional
provision,
there
is
a
presumption
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]accept
it
the
way
it
should
–-
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
i
think
you
said
yesterday
that
this
confession
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that
is
not
getting
[inaudible]
would
have
done
had
the
government
said
these
people
what
the
court
had
said
they
should
have
done
and
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
he
would
have
it
if
the
state
had
not
done
what
it
did
[inaudible]
if
it
had
not
been
done,
he
would
have
had
[inaudible]
at
his
trail
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
jury
found
murder
it
seems
to
me
the
typical
case
where
the
jury
is
going
to
exercise
their
power
under
the
law
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
case
is
a
lot
stronger
with
that.
