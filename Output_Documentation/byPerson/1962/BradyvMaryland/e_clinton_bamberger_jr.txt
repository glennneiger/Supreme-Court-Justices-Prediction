mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
was
an
appeal
more
from
a
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
from
its
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
agreed
with
the
petitioner's
contention
in
that
court
that
he
had
been
denied
due
process
when
the
prosecutor
withheld
a
confession,
which
the
petitioner's
accomplice
had
made
to
the
prosecuting
authorities,
to
the
police.
but
having
agreed
that
due
process
of
law
had
been
denied
to
the
petitioner,
the
court
of
appeals
then
by
its
mandate,
respected
the
relief
to
a
new
trial
on
the
question
of
punishment
only.
it
did
not
disturb
the
verdict
of
guilt,
the
verdict
of
guilt
of
murder
in
first
--
of
murder
in
the
first
degree.
and
the
court
of
appeals
would
by
its
mandate
send
the
case
back
to
the
trial
court
for
the
plaintiff,
if
he
would
so
elect,
to
have
a
trial
before
a
jury
with
guilt
already
determined
and
only
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
the
jury
would
say
he
is
guilty
without
capital
punishment
and
so
respect
the
court's
power
to
impose
capital
punishment
or
merely
say
guilty
and
leave
the
court
free
to
impose
capital
punishment
or
to
sentence
to
imprisonment
for
life.
one
fact,
peculiar
to
this
case,
peculiar
to
maryland
and
i
think
also
to
indiana,
but
at
the
base
of
this
case
to
which
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention,
is
that
in
maryland
the
jury
in
a
criminal
case
is
the
judge
of
the
law
as
well
as
the
judge
of
the
fact.
and
the
court's
instructions
to
a
jury
in
a
criminal
case
in
maryland
are
advisory
only,
not
binding
on
the
jury,
and
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals
go
to
the
jury
merely
as
a
means
of
enlightenment.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes,
sir
i
think
i
have
a
case,
but
i
think
i
will
have
a
more
difficult
case.
i
think
then
we
would
have
a
more
basic
consideration
of
whether
the
depravation
of
the
constitutional
right
is
the
violation
of
such
a
thing
so
sacred
that
we
are
not
going
to
leave
any
appellate
court
to
try
to
sift
out
what
the
affect
of
this
might
be.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
he
was
participating
in
a
robbery
and
there
was
homicide
in
the
course
of
the
robbery,
and
if
the
jury
found
those
facts
and
they
were
--
some
of
them
were
denied
by
him
in
some
respects
and
there
was
a
contention
made
on
appeal
that
the
robbery
had
been
completed
before
the
homicide
occurred,
but
there
certainly
were
facts
from
which
the
jury
could
very
easily
find,
aside
from
this
confession,
could
very
easily
find
that
he
had
--
it
was
a
felony
murder
and
under
binding
instruction
would
be
guilty.
what
had
happened
here
was
that
a
man
named
brooks
was
murdered
in
the
course
of
a
robbery.
the
petitioner,
brady
and
his
companion
boblit
were
arrested
several
days
later.
the
petitioner
was
arrested
first.
he
had
fled
to
cuba
and
then
had
returned,
surrendered
himself
and
was
return
to
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
office
in
miami.
a
day
after
that,
as
a
result
of
some
statements
made
by
the
petitioner
in
florida,
his
companion
boblit
was
arrested
in
maryland.
now
statements
were
taken
from
both
of
these
men.
of
course
the
important
statements
are
the
first
four
statements
taken
from
the
petitioner's
companion,
boblit.
in
each
of
those
four
statements,
boblit
said,
i
didn't
commit
the
homicide,
i
didn't
commit
the
killing,
brady
did
it.
but
after
boblit
knew
that
the
petitioner
was
in
the
custody
of
the
police
and
after
the
police
in
maryland
had
taken
some
statements
from
the
petitioner,
the
police
went
to
boblit,
the
companion
and
they
said,
there
are
some
discrepancies
in
these
first
four
stories,
which
you
have
given
us.
now
he
knows
the
police
speak
of
discrepancies,
he
knows
his
companion
is
in
the
same
jail
house
and
he
now
makes
a
fifth
statement,
and
in
this
fifth
statement
he,
boblit,
admits
that
not
brady,
not
the
petitioner,
but
he
boblit
was
the
person
who
actually
committed
the
killing.
and
one
other
significant
thing
about
this
fifth
statement
is
that
at
the
end
of
it,
when
he
was
asked
to
sign
it,
he
refused
to
sign
it,
although
he
had
signed
the
first
four
statements.
these
two
men
had
separate
counsels.
in
the
course
of
preparing
for
trial,
counsel
for
this
petitioner
asked
the
prosecutor
for
copies
of
the
statements,
not
only
made
by
the
petitioner,
but
also
the
statements
made
by
boblit.
the
prosecutor
gave
to
counsel
for
the
petitioner
only
the
first
four
statements
made
by
boblit.
the
four
statements
in
which
boblit
said,
i
didn't
do
it,
the
petitioner
here
brady
did
it.
he
did
not,
the
prosecutor
did
not
give
to
the
petitioner's
counsel,
nor
inform
the
petitioner's
council
of
the
existence
of
the
fifth
unsigned
statement,
which
at
least
in
the
one
detail,
the
fact
that
boblit,
not
the
petitioner
was
the
actual
murderer
corroborated
the
petitioner's
defense.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
i
think
the
importance
of
it
for
this
argument
your
honor
is
that
on
these
facts
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it
would
raise
the
same
question
and
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
it
adds
anything,
but
i
did
want
to
set
the
chronology,
that
the
withholding
occurred
prior
to
this
petitioner's
trial,
prior
to
the
time
when
a
jury
found
that
he
was
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
and
my
argument
on
the
denial
of
due
process
is
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
this
withholding
denied
due
process,
that
everything
that
happened
from
that
point
on
was
unfair,
that
this
denial
vitiates
all
that
happened,
at
least
all
that
happened
after
that
and
in
some
circumstances
could
even
affect
things
that
happened
before.
but
here
was
a
man
who
was
deprived
of
what
the
court
agrees
he
was
entitled
too,
prior
to
the
time
of
his
trial
of
guilt,
and
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
put
him
back
there.
they
only
put
him
back
to
a
point
after
the
jury
has
found
him
guilty.
now,
if
--
as
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes,
sir
but
i
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
and
this
is
particularly
true
in
maryland.
this,
if
you
had
as
in
california
a
system
where
there
are
the
two
processes,
the
process
of
finding
guilt
and
the
sentencing
process,
and
if
as
in
--
if
this
case
was
in
california,
i
would
be
hard
put
to
make
the
arguments
that
i
make
here,
because
you
have
two
separate
processes,
the
process
of
finding
guilt
and
the
process
of
sentencing
and
you
have
a
jury
there
bound
by
the
court's
instructions
on
the
law.
but
this
isn't
so
here
and
this
is
also,
it's
difficult
to
separate
in
this
case,
the
argument,
the
denial
of
equal
protection
under
the
laws
and
the
denial
due
processes
of
the
law.
but
this
is
where
the
evil
of
the
--
where
the
equal
protection
is
denied,
because
the
trial
to
which
brady
was
entitled
was
a
trial
with
this
information,
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
he
should
have
had
this
when
he
asked
for
it.
before
a
jury
with
the
right,
not
just
the
power,
but
the
right
to
judge
the
law
and
the
fact,
and
a
jury
with
the
right
and
the
power
to
find
him
the
guilty
of
first
degree
murder,
guilty
of
murder
or
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
but
without
capital
punishment,
guilty
of
murder
in
the
second
degree,
guilty
of
manslaughter
or
acquitted,
and
this
is
not
the
trial
he
had.
this
is
the
trial
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
he
ought
to
have.
it's
the
trial
that
every
other
defendant
accused
in
similar
circumstances
in
maryland
will
have
and
then
finally
it's
the
trial
which
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
said
he
isn't
going
to
have
and
he'll
never
have.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
i
think
several
questions
would
have
arisen,
your
honor.
yes,
i
think
it
would
have
been
admissible
on
the
issue
of
guilt,
because
when
the
jury
is
judging
the
law,
they
could
well
consider
that
in
our
view
of
the
law,
the
man
who
pulls
the
trigger
is
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
and
appellant
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
they're
a
legislature
ad
hoc
mr.
justice
harlan
or
a
judge
ad
hoc?
they
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
they
didn't
rule
that
it
wasn't
admissible
on
the
issue
of
guilt,
they
said
it's
relevant
only
on
the
issue
of
punishment,
but
that's
where
i
say
that
is
an
error
on
this
one.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes
sir,
except
that
i
--
it
seems
to
me
they
can
say
it's
admissible
on
the
question
of
the
punishment
without
necessarily
saying
it's
not
admissible
on
the
question
here.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes,
sir
the
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
they
were
instructed
at
page
42
of
the
record
that
they
could
find
the
petitioner
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
without
any
restrictions
on
the
punishment,
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
without
capital
punishment,
murder
in
the
second
degree,
manslaughter,
it's
at
page
44
of
the
record,
the
first
full
paragraph,
beginning
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
five
possible
verdicts,
second
degree
manslaughter
and
equivalent.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
well
i
have
to
see
the
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
i
was
thinking
of
the
court's
restrictive
statement
on
the
--
at
the
end
and
i
don't
think
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
no,
sir
i
think
you
really
got
it.
in
the
one
--
in
one
similar
case
which
had
come
before
the
court
of
appeals,
not
by
the
same
route,
which
this
case
took;
this
case
came
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
by
its
post
conviction
proceeding,
but
in
a
prior
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
of
day
versus
state,
two
defendants
were
indicted
for
a
felonious
homicide.
they
asked
for
a
severance.
the
severance
was
denied.
incriminating
statements
by
each
of
them
were
admitted
in
evidence.
the
jury
was
instructed,
well
disregard
what
a
says
that
incriminates
b,
and
vice
versa.
this
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
on
the
appeal
from
the
trial
court's
denial
of
the
motion
of
severance
and
the
argument
was
made
that
it
makes
no
difference
because
both
are
involved
in
the
felony
murder
and
therefore
both
are
guilty
of
first
degree
murder,
but
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
in
that
case
that
the
jury
is
the
judge
of
the
law.
they
recognized
also
that
even
through
this
evidence
looking
at
it
as
a
lawyer,
purely
as
a
lawyer,
even
though
this
evidence
simply
most
directly
effected
the
punishment,
yet
the
failure
of
the
court
to
grant
a
severance
in
this
case
amounted
to
such
a
denial
of
due
process,
that
the
cases
were
remanded
for
separate
trials
on
both
the
issues
of
guilt
and
punishment.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes
sir
and
the
petition
--
this
came
up
on
a
post
conviction
proceeding.
the
petition
for
post
conviction
release
sought
a
new
trial,
set
aside
both
the
verdict
of
guilt
and
the
sentence
in
an
entire
new
trial.
the
appellant's
argument
i
think
was
directed
very
strongly
towards
the
fact
that
this
evidence
did
go
to
the
question
of
punishment.
and
in
the
appellant's
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
did
make
statements
that
the
appellant
was
guilty
of
first
degree
murder.
i
was
there
really
directing
myself
to
an
argument
that
even
though
it
only
goes
to
the
question
of
punishment,
it
still
amounts
to
a
denial
of
a
constitutional
right.
the
question
of
what
kind
of
relief
ought
to
be
afforded
never
came
up,
until
at
the
very
close
of
argument.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
had
finished
rebuttal
argument
and
was
at
least
moving
to
the
chair,
when
the
chief
judge
burns
of
the
court
said
to
me
mr.
bamberger,
if
we
agree
with
you
that
due
process
has
been
denied,
what
relief
would
you
want,
and
my
response
during
then
was
that
we
were
entitled
to
a
whole
new
trial
both
on
the
question
of
guilt
and
of
punishment.
i
think
that
what
this
sentence
means
is
that
my
brief
and
my
oral
argument
in
the
court
certainly
was
particularly
directed
to
the
fact
that
the
evidence
did
effect
only
punishment,
but
then
regardless
of
that,
in
a
matter
to
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
well,
that
would
not
--
that
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
record
because
the
post
conviction
petition
sought
a
new
trial,
and
to
set
aside
the
verdict
of
guilt
and
the
sentence
and
a
new
trial,
the
relief
--
this
was
a
relief
prayed
in
that
petition
and
when
it
was
once
raised
by
the
court,
chief
justice
burns
specifically
said,
you
just
want
a
new
trial
of
punishment
or
a
new
trial
of
guilt
too
and
i
said
we
think
we
are
entitled
to
both.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
said
there
could
be
no
verdict.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
i
think
there
is
language
in
their
opinion
which
suggests
that,
but
i
challenge
the
correctness
of
that
because
the
jury
could
have
found
this
man
guilty
of
something
less
than
first
degree
murder
or
could
have
acquitted
him
and
the
lower
court's
instructions
recognized
that
and
the
state
didn't
object
to
those
instructions.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals,
yes
sir
i
think
they
did.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
and
there
it's
a
difference
between
the
power
and
the
rights.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
leaves
the
power
there,
but
in
maryland
it
is
the
matter
of
right
too
and
the
court
has
got
to
recognize
that
you
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
well,
yes
sir,
legal
right
is
enough
i
think,
but
he
is
entitled
to
that
kind
of
a
trial.
he
is
entitled
to
a
trial
regardless
of
what
we
may
think
of
this
system
and
this
jury.
he
was
entitled
to
that
kind
of
a
trial
with
this
evidence
available
to
him
before
that
trial
began
and
with
the
jury
entitled
to
acquit
him
on
this
evidence.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
to
my
knowledge
only
maryland
and
indiana.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes
sir,
several
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes
sir
it
has,
yes
sir
it
has
been
suspended.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
this
rule
has
existed
in
other
states.
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
nelson
versus
the
united
states,
which
is
an
opinion
of
some
130
pages,
there
is
a
review
of
the
history
of
this
and
all
of
the
states.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes,
i
think
principally
in
the
eastern
counties
and
it
still
exists
in
maryland
and
in
indiana.
this
was
not
a
matter
of
the
record.
there
was
a
bill
strongly
endorsed
by
leaders
of
the
bar
as
it
was
once
in
illinois,
in
the
current
session
of
the
maryland
legislature
which
i
understand
has
died
in
a
committee.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
it
would
at
least
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes,
so
it
would
at
least
be
error
for
the
court
to
confine
its
instructions
to
anything
less
than
that.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
to
say
that
the
trial
court's
instruction
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
no,
this
is
implicit
in
the
court's
opinion.
it
had
to
say
that.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
said
in
those
terms
in
this
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
that--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
it
was
not
argued
at
any
point
in
the
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
i
don't
recall
one
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
in
one
part
of
the
state's
argument
the
state
assumes
that
the
evidence
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
no
sir
i
was
not
a
trial
counsel.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yeah.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
think
we
can
consider
this
case
as
if
the
statement
by
boblit,
the
withheld
statement
is
the
end
of
the
evidence
that
we
could
discover
or
that
the
withheld
statement
is
in
itself
the
truth
of
what
occurred.
the
point
is
that
this
was
a
statement
which
was
the
fifth
of
five
which
was
a
statement
made
after
four
denials
of
having
anything
to
do
with
the
murder.
now
the
man
came
so
far
in
that
statement,
he
still
implicated
brady.
at
this
point
all
interrogation
of
him
stops.
he
was
never
again
questioned
by
the
police.
he
was
never
questioned
by
counsel
for
this
defendant,
and
the
point
is
where
would
this
have
led
to,
i
don't
know,
i
don't
know.
i
mean
the
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
but
i
can't
reach
into
his
mind,
but
i
think
that
part
of
what
he
is
saying
there
and
this
is
my
understanding
of
it
is,
that
he
had
these
arguments
before
the
jury,
he
had
the
issue
of
both
guilt
and
punishment,
but
on
the
question
--
on
the
issue
of
guilt
he
had
no
evidence,
no
evidence
outside
of
the
denial
by
this
man
brady
himself.
and
so
he
chose
rather
than
to
put
both
these
issues
to
the
jury,
he
made
a
tactic,
he
made
a
choice
of
strategy
and
he
decided
instead
of
putting
both
these
issues
to
the
jury
and
maybe
angering
them,
because
i
don't
have
very
much
to
say
about
this
guilt
thing,
i
am
going
spread
the
cards
on
the
table
and
i
am
just
going
to
go
hard
on
this
issue
of
mercy
and
on
the
question
of
the
punishment.
but
that's
a
choice
that
he
made
after
he
had
been
overreached
by
the
state
and
as
much
as
that
is
speculation,
so
i
would
have
to
speculate
to
say
to
you
how
the
trial
would
have
deferred,
if
before
the
trial
began
he
had
that
fifth
statement
where
the
man
--
you
see
at
this
point
this
is
a
statement
made
when
the
man
knows
that
the
other
man
is
in
custody
and
when
he
is
told
by
the
police
that
there
are
some
discrepancies
in
what
you
said
before
and
he
comes
--
he
changes
the
story.
now
he
doesn't
change
it
so
far
as
to
exonerate
this
man,
but
where
might
further
interrogation
of
him
by
the
police
led,
where
might
it
have
led
further
interrogation
and
investigation
and
a
testimony
of
the
trial
by
counsel
for
brady,
this
is
speculation,
i
don't
know.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes.
well
that's
part
of
it
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
--
that
is
just
part
of
it
quoted
by
the
trial
court
in
the
post-conviction
proceeding,
but
at
page
39
of
the
record,
pages
39
to
41,
the
entire
statement
is
reproduced.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
dated
july
9,
1958.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
what
position,
well
i
think
they
have
already
put
that
question
aside.
in
this
case
they
have
decided
that
it
would
admissible.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
well,
[attempt
to
laughter]
it
would
at
least
i
think
be
settled
at
the
trial
court
level.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
well
there
are
other
ways
we
could
get
the
testimony
in
i
think
and
the
fruit
of
it,
what
is
my
belief
then
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
we
could
offer
the
man
himself
and
maybe
the
use
of
that
statement
might
lead
to
some
other
evidence
which
would
be
admissible
and
helpful
and
i
don't
know,
but
this
is
really
the
crux
of
our
problem
in
this
court
that
there
was
an
unconstitutional
suppression
or
a
withholding
of
evidence
prior
to
a
trial,
and
now
we
are
only
going
to
have
half
of
that
and
we
are
going
to
have
a
different
trial
than
anybody
else
would
have
and
we
are
not
going
to
have
the
trial
of
the
court
of
appeals
said
we
should
have
had.
they
admitted
that
the
first
trial
was
unfair
and
we
should
have
had
another
trial
and
then
they
--
i
assure
you
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
as
certain
as
i
can
be
or
any
lawyer
can
be
of
what
a
court
decides,
never
meant
to
decide
in
the
brady
case
that
it
was
tacking
on
any
additional
limitation
to
the
maryland
constitutional
provision.
the
best
proof
that
i
can
say
for
that
is
that
it
was
not
discussed
in
briefs.
it
was
not
discussed
at
oral
arguments,
and
in
the
giles
case
where
they
was
a
vigorous
attack
on
this
maryland
constitutional
provision,
it
was
held
has
violating
the
due
process
clause
and
as
violating
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
court
went
at
great
pains
to
cite
the
history
of
this
constitutional
provision
and
they
cite
the
limitations
which
have
been
engrossed
on
it
through
the
years.
and
there
is
no
mention
of
the
brady
case,
nor
is
there
any
mention
of
any
additional
limitation
that
the
brady
case
put
upon
this
constitutional
provision.
and
the
giles
case
was
decided
in
just
last
year
1962
and
i
--
there
was
no
intention
in
the
brady
case
to
change
the
law
of
maryland
that
the
jury
has
the
right
to
judge
the
law
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
the
only
category
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
is
that
they
said
this
comes
by
post-conviction
and
under
the
post-conviction
statute
we
have
a
broad
area
of
the
remedy
which
we
may
apply.
i
say
this
because
in
the
opinion,
chief
judge
burns
refers
to
that
section
of
the
post-conviction
act,
but
he
says
also
that
he
compares
it
with
the
rule
of
the
court
which
in
an
ordinary
criminal
appeal
gives
it
the
same
kind
of
a
power
to
tailor
the
remedy.
now
i
think
the
only
category
that
i
can
put
john
brady
in
is
that
he
is
placed
in
a
category
of
a
man
whose
constitutional
rights
have
been
denied
by
the
suppression
or
withholding
of
evidence.
and
who
either
wasn't
smart
enough
to
find
it
out
until
he
had,
the
time
for
a
direct
appeal
had
expired
or
the
state
so
cleverly
hid
it
that
he
couldn't
find
it
out
until
the
time
for
direct
appeal
had
expired
and
so
he
is
forced
to
come
up
by
the
post-conviction
remedy.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
then
that's
--
the
basic
error
there
is
that
i
don't
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
meant
to
say
that
the
jury
in
maryland
is
no
longer
going
to
have
the
power
to
judge
the
law
in
a
criminal
case
and
in
effect
what
they've
done
is
direct
the
verdict
of
guilt
of
first-degree
murder
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes
sir,
they
have
a
duty
to
follow
their
oath
as
jurors,
but
part
of
the
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
they
have
a
duty
not
to
depart
from
the
law,
but
what
is
the
law,
they
have
the
right
to
define
the
law.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
more
than
the
power
they
have
the
right.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
i
think
they
have
a
duty
to
follow
that
clear
rule
of
law,
but
they
also
have
the
duty
to
follow
the
--
to
exercise
the
right
that
they
have
to
judge
the
law
and
there
maybe
--
i
can,
i
could
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
i
think
if
a
jury
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
if
a
jury
came
out
of
the
jury
room
and
they
said,
well
we
really
didn’t
think,
we
don’t
think
that
the
law
ought
to
be
this,
but
the
judge
told
us
it
was
and
all
12
of
us
agreed
that
we
wouldn’t
want
the
law
to
be
that,
and
we
don’t
really
think
it
is,
but
we
were
in
a
civil
case
last
week
and
the
judge
told
us
we
were
bound
by
the
law.
i
think
they
would
then
have
violated
their
duty
to
judge
the
law.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
have
a
jury
exercise
its
right
to
judge
the
law.
i
would
put
it
that
way.
and
every
other
defendant
will
be
tried
on
both
guilt
and
punishment
before
that
kind
of
a
jury,
but
this
man
won’t
have
that
kind
of
a
fair
trial.
the
court
of
appeals
said
he
didn’t
have
it
on
the
issue
of
guilt
and
they
said
he
won’t
have
it,
and
this
is
how
he
set
aside.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
he
may
not
do
that?
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
because
his
instructions
may
only
be
advisory.
he
must
instruct
him
that
his
instructions
are
advisory,
he
may
tell
them
what
the
statute
says
and
counsel
may
argue
contrary
to
his
instructions.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
this
is
what
--
the
court
of
appeals
has
in
fact
directed
a
verdict.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
every
jury
may
or
may
not
follow
instructions.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
that
the
jury
may
or
may
not
follow
his
instructions
and
that
he
can
give
them
such
an
instruction?
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes,
but
he
must
say
that
it
is
advisory.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
a
jury
may
say
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
no
sir,
they
would
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
that
is
exactly
the
point
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
tried
by
the
court.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
found
guilty
in
the
same
sentence.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
the
sentence
is
death
sir.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
both.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
both
of
the
warrant
of
execution
was
stayed
by
the
court,
because
of
the
appellate
procedures
in
the
brady
case
and
the
governor
has
just
not
--
has
withheld
the
warrant
in
the
bobbitt
case
awaiting
the
outcome
of
this.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge.
i
think
i
wouldn’t
have
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
he
was
tried
after.
this
is
when
the
--
his
fifth
statement
was
offered
in
evidence.
at
his
trial,
his
counsel
objected,
because
he
hadn’t
signed
it.
the
trial
court
erroneously
excluded
it.
it
was
discovered
by
counsel
for
brady
later
when
a
clemency
petition
was
being
prepared
and
this
--
the
reference
to
the
statement
in
the
record
arouse
some
curiosity,
that’s
the
first
time
that
brady
or
his
counsel
knew
of
the
existence
of
it
and
this
was
to
go
back
to
the
beginning
of
this
argument.
mr.
chief
justice,
this
conference
in
the
trial
court’s
chambers
was
--
at
this
point,
brady’s
counsel
made
it
perfectly
clear
to
the
state
that
the
one
defense
that
was
being
asserted
that
brady
wasn’t
the
man
who
actually
did
the
killing.
now,
he
could
have
argued
with
on
that
point
with
that
evidence.
he
could
have
argued
to
a
jury
that
you
ought
to
construe
the
felony
murder
statute
that
the
man
who
actually
pulls
the
trigger
in
the
commission
of
the
felony
is
the
man
who
will
get
the
death
sentence,
but
the
other
man
won’t.
and
--
but
he
apparently
made
a
choice
that
he
didn’t
have
any
evidence
to
support
a
strong
argument
on
this,
because
he
had
only
the
testimony
of
brady,
and
he
might
have
made
a
far
different
choice,
if
he
knew
of
the
statement
and
he
might
have
had
for
a
stronger
evidence
and
the
statement
alone,
if
he
knew
of
it.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
argument
was
not
transcribed.
the
only
reference
to
that
is
at
the
beginning
of
the
court’s
instructions,
where
the
court
says
that
--
and
the
court
feels
that
even
though
there
has
been
a
confession
by
counsel
for
the
defendant
that
this
traverser
is
guilty
of
murder
on
the
first-degree
without
capital
punishment.
i
take
it
that
at
this
point,
having
no
evidence
to
support
any
argument,
any
strong
argument
that
they
ought
to
find
the
man
guilty
of
something
less
than
first-degree
murder
that
counsel
had
in
effect
said
to
the
jury,
“i
want
a
verdict
of
murder
in
the
first-degree
without
capital
punishment
and
we
lay
ourselves
in
your
hands.”
i
don’t
know
what
he
said.
it’s
not
transcribed,
but.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don’t
think
so.
i
would
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
well,
i’d
say
it
would
violate
the
equal
--
certainly
the
equal
protection
clause,
because
it
sets
this
man
aside
in
a
different
category
and
gives
him
a
trial
before
a
jury
with
his
guilt
already
determined
and
just
on
the
question
of
punishment.
and
the
only
reason
i
can
see
to
put
him
in
that
classification
is,
because
he
didn’t
discover
the
overreaching
by
the
state
until
after
the
time
for
a
direct
appeal
had
expired.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
tried
by
jury
which
may
or
may
not
have
done
its
duty,
but
by
a
prosecutor
who
didn’t
do
his
duty
and
if
the
prosecutor
had
done
his
duty
and
the
jury
had
done
its
duty,
the
result
might
have
been
different.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
if
the
prosecutor
had
come
up
with
this
evidence
for
brady
prior
to
the
trial,
where
might
it
have
lead?
now
in
all
the
cases
in
which
this
court
has
considered
denials
of
due
process
i
have
not
found
any
case
where
the
court
segregated
the
conviction
and
the
guilt
or
any
part
of
the
case,
but
have
always
said
it
vesicates
the
conviction.
and
one
very
important
consideration
by
this
court
in
doing
that
is,
what
are
you
encouraging
law
enforcement
officers
to
do
and
i
think
that’s
important
in
this
case.
if
this
results
stand
then
what’s
to
prohibit
the
prosecutor
with
perhaps
not
the
most
honorable
motives
to
take
the
same
kind
of
chance
with
evidence
in
a
first-degree
murder
case
knowing
that
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
well
i
think
it
was
settled
by
the
thomas
case
which
preceded
this
and
so
did
the
court
of
appeal.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
well,
i
am
not
--
i
don’t
say
that
i
had
to
prove
that
there
was
any
guile
by
this
prosecutor
in
this
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
that.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
no,
i
am
suggesting
that
the
remedy
for
the
denial
of
a
constitutional
right
ought
to
be
so
complete
that
no
one
can
take
any
advantage
of
it
in
the
future.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
in
this
case?
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
it
was
the
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
the
failure
of
the
state
to
give
to
boblit’s
counsel
the
statement
made
by
his
companion
prior
to
the
trial,
more
than
that
giving
him
four
of
them
and
not
the
fifth
one,
misleading
him,
indicating
to
him
that,
oh,
sure
i’ll
give
you
boblit’s
statements
and
here
they
are,
but
not
given
him
the
one
that
was
important.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
i
think
i
rely
on
many
of
your
prior
cases
as
did
the
court
of
appeals.
the
particular
case
in
point
is
a
decision
of
the
third
circuit
but
the
--
and
i
can’t
point
to
a
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
those
cases
are
not
briefed
in
this
brief
and
i
don’t
remember
that
particular
case,
but
in
the
--
this
point
was
argued
of
course
before
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland.
the
other
--
on
part
of
that
on
constitutional
or
the
depravation
of
the
constitutional
right
was
that,
when
that
was
done,
this
--
the
state
knew
that
the
issue
that
brady
was
going
to
present
to
the
jury
was
whether
he
did
or
boblit
did
it.
they
knew
that
that
was
the
prime
issue.
all
of
these
facts
together
amounted
to
a
depravation
of
due
process
by
failure
to
give
him
that
scenario.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
al
corta
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
well
i
argued
on
that
basis
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yeah.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yeah.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
don’t
think
that
my
case
stands
or
falls
on
the
peculiar
provision
of
the
maryland
constitution,
but
i
think
my
case
is
an
easier
one
to
argue,
because
of
the
peculiar
maryland
provision.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
no
sir,
it
would
not
be
different,
it
would
perhaps
be
less
forceful.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
my
case
is
a
lot
stronger
with
that.
i
don’t
give
it
away,
i
say
that
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
would
make
the
same
argument
but
i
am
more
comfortable
making
it
without
maryland
constitutional
provision.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
the
court
has
not
changed
the
law
in
either
the
giles
case
or
in
the
brady
case
and
the
court
by
its
own
rule,
which
i
have
included
at
page
17
of
the
appendix
of
this
brief
says
that
the
instructions
are
advisory
and
that
the
court
is
required
to
give
instructions.
now
the
court
now
by
the
rules
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland,
the
trial
court
must
give
instructions,
which
if
they
are
requested
and
if
they
state
the
applicable
law.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
well
i
would
argue
from
the
other
side
of
this
trial
table,
that
what’s
the
right
this
defendant
has
to
be
tried
before
what
kind
of
a
jury.
does
he
have
a
right
to
be
--
has
anyone
ever
said
he
has
a
right
to
be
tried
before
a
jury
which
will
do
its
duty
and
maybe
interpret
the
law
as
the
judge
thinks
the
law
ought
to
be
interpreted,
but
he’s
got
a
right
also
to
be
judged
before
a
jury
which
has
the
right
to
tell
the
judge
to
take
his
interpretation
of
the
law
and
throw
it
out
the
window
and
that
the
jury
itself
will
say
what
the
law
is
and
as
much
as
we
as
lawyers
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
well
i
say
it’s
the
duty
of
the
jury
to
exercise
the
constitutional
prerogative
that
it
has.
it
has
just
as
much
that
duty
as
it
has
a
duty
to
follow
its
oath
in
any
other
regard.
the
court
instructs
them.
these
instructions
which
i
give
to
you
on
the
law
are
advisory.
you
decide
what
the
law
is.
they
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
the
right
to
disregard
it
and
the
duty
to
disregard
it
if
their
conscience
convinces
them
that
the
law
is
an
ass
and
ought
to
the
otherwise.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
well
i
can’t
take
it
--
if
you
take
a
clear
rule
of
law
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
and
they’ve
got
the
right
to
do
it
and
even
if
the
rule
of
law
is
perfectly
clear,
but
they
think
they
ought
not
to
do
--
convict
this
man
of
it,
they’ve
got
a
right
not
to
convict
him,
this
is
the
history
of
the
purpose.
it
was
to
protect
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
if
they
may
disregard?
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
they
have
a
right
not
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
well,
i
think
i’ve
been
trying
to
say
that
and
that
i
say
as
they
have
a
duty
to
follow
the
law
so
they
have
a
duty
to
follow
the
constitution
and
so
exercise
their
prerogative.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
i
think
i
might
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
the
constitution
i
hope.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
oh
yes.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
and
i
say
they
have
a
duty
to
follow
the
constitution
and
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
that’s
the
first
duty
and
mr.
justice
bernnan
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
the
jury.
alright
and
as
mr.
justice
bernnan
says
then
they
are
--
then
they
got
a
duty
to
follow
nothing.
well
i
suppose
that
they’ve
got
a
duty
to
follow
the
constitution
and
if
that
leads
them
to
disregard
some
duty
that
they
might
have
to
judge
properly
then
i
can’t
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
well
they
may
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
i
have
--
i
can’t
quote
it
to
you
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
remember
nothing
in
the
oath
given
to
criminal
juries,
which
is
different
than
that
given
to
civil
juries
and
nothing
there
about
following
or
judging
the
laws
as
such,
i
think
it’s
well
and
truly
tried.
the
issue
is
--
mr.
e.
clinton
bamberger,
jr.
well
brought
before
you
in
the
case
of
plaintiff
versus
defendant
or
state
versus
defendant.
i
think
its
well
and
truly
tried
the
issue.
