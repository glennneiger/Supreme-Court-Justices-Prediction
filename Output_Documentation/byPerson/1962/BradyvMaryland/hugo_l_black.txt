justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
about
what
a
general
verdict
in
a
murder
case
means
anyhow,
isn't
it,
[inaudible]
government
to
appeal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah,
but
the
language
used
is
to
leave
the
power
there
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
legal
right
as
well
as
a
technical
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
a
matter
of
out
of
court
confessions
made
by
a
third
person
admissible
as
an
exception
to
the
hearsay
rule
in
maryland?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
case
or
…
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
they
do
not
have
to
argue
that
it's
unconstitutional
for
the
state
to
recognize
the
hearsay
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand,
you
say
that
the
constitution
says
one
thing
and
the
law
says
another.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
does
the
constitution
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
that
constitution
is
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
you
in
effect
saying
is
that
they
have
changed
your
constitution,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seemed
to
mean
contrary
to
what
it
seems
to
mean
on
its
face?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
another
thing
to
find
out
is
that
if
we
ought
to
go
on
the
basis
of
your
argument
that
the
constitution
said,
that
it
means
what
it
says,
that
means
now,
has
a
less
restricted
meaning
by
reason
of
the
recent
opinion
of
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
stated
bluntly,
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
saying
the
recent
rule
that
the
jury
is
not
a
judge
of
the
law
in
fact
in
maryland,
although
the
constitution
says
it
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
remedy
if
they
do
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
same
as
the
general
verdict?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
can
tell
the
jury
what
the
law
is,
but
they
can't
decide
what
the
law
is,
for
themselves.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
that's
right,
but
i'm
just
--
if
we
have
to
decide
this,
i
would
want
very,
very,
very
clear
reason
myself
for
saying
if
the
constitution
of
maryland
says
that
the
jury
shall
be
the
judge
of
the
law
and
in
fact
that
can
be
escaped
by
saying,
the
judge
can
be
the
judge
of
the
law,
in
fact
he
can
get
it
covered
and
that's
the
law
they
have
to
follow,
not
their
own.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
you
need
to
follow.
you
were
saying
if
you
are
drawing
a
distinction
between
that
duty
and
what
can
do
under
the
constitutional
provision.
do
you
have
that
same
thing
with
reference
to
liable
in
maryland?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah,
same
provision.
justice
hugo
l.
black
many
states
have
that
and
why
they've
had
there
i
don't
understand
it,
but
it
remained
the
law.
it's
always
been
held,
they
didn't
have
to
follow
the
judge
at
all,
when
they
have
the
duty
do
it.
they
can
decide
as
they
saw
fit.
i
think
[inaudible],
i'm
not
sure.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
not
to
say
it
is
harmless
error?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
vagaries
of
a
jury's
reasoning
are
beyond
human
understanding
when
you
begin
to
try
to
hold
that
something
would
have
been
--
would
have
done
him
no
good
[inaudible],
but
it
is
difficult.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
situation
would
you
be
in,
if
you
would
go
back
to
maryland
if
the
supreme
court
were
to
hold
that
this
confession
could
not
be
on
news
because
of
the
[inaudible].
justice
hugo
l.
black
sometimes
those
things
we
think
have
settled
are
not
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
--
you
might
be
coming
in
the
position
of
having
to
say
that
some
constitutional
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
could
offer
the
man
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what
legal
category
according
to
your
idea
that
the
supreme
court
put
its
refusal
to
let
this
case
be
retried
so
that
evidence
could
be
offered
on
the
merit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
have
--
they
did
that
on
the
ground
of
harmless
error?
as
i
see
it,
what
they
have
said
is
that,
he
is
not
entitled
to
this
rather
new
trial,
if
you
are
correct
in
saying
he
is
denied
his
constitutional
right,
but
it
would
have
done
no
good
in
that
issue
because
we
stated
as
a
matter
of
law
that
on
the
facts
here
stated,
he
was
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
anyhow?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question,
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
case
was
sent
back
for
a
closed
trial
on
both
issues
and
this
precise
confession
was
offered,
which
is
held
admissible,
that
the
judge
charged
the
jury,
i
charge
you
as
a
matter
of
law,
could
he
charge
you?
i
charge
you
as
a
matter
of
law
that
this
confession
shows
that
this
defendant
brady
is
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
and
it
is
your
duty
so
define,
will
he
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
the
effect
of
what’s
been
done
here
is,
if
the
supreme
court
is
holding
just
exactly
what
you
say
the
trial
judge
couldn’t
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
keep
informing
the
jury
the
evidence
on
the
basis
that
as
a
matter
of
law
he
is
guilty
of
first
degree
as
shown
by
that
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
in
that
case,
in
that
case
the
defendant
would
have
a
chance
to
get
the
judgment
of
the
jury
on
whether
they
would
hold
it
murder
in
the
first
degree,
would
they
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
wouldn’t
have
to
hold
it,
would
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
here
the
court
has
held
it,
taking
the
place
of
the
jury
in
making
that
decision.
justice
hugo
l.
black
tried
after
or
before.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
like
to
pursue
my
question
with
one
more
that
i
ask
you.
let’s
assume
that
the
court
has
--
you
said
the
function
of
the
jury
in
this
man’s
case
in
the
state
of
maryland
that
it
has
decided
as
a
fact
what
these
--
under
maryland
law
would
be
left
to
the
jury
to
decide?
in
what
way
do
you
say
that
would
violate
the
federal
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
denial
of
constitutional
rights?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
say
that,
yes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
point
to
as
a
denial
of
constitutional
rights?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
relying
on
any
of
our
prior
cases
to
say
that
that’s
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
we
not
have
a
case
several
years
ago
on
that
point.
i
have
a
vague
recollection
of
it,
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
recall,
we
had
a
case
from
texas
in
which
a
mexican
was
abused
and
murdered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
right.
do
you
think
that
apply
to
this?
are
you
arguing
on
that
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
answer
his
argument
that
even
though
the
constitution
says
that
the
jury
has
that
right,
they
have
the
right
to
decide
it,
but
it’s
their
duty
not
to
take
advantage
of
that
right
which
the
constitution
said
they
right
the
exert,
how
do
you
answer
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
as
i
understand
it,
his
argument
is,
that
it’s
the
duty
of
the
jury,
not
to
exercise
this
right,
which
the
constitution
said
they
could?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
what
is
this
supreme
law
of
maryland?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
that’s
the
supreme
law
of
maryland,
why
did
you
say
they
--
why
do
you
not
answer
the
question
when
it’s
asked
to
you,
if
they
have
a
right
to
disregard
the
law
that
they
are
not
disregarding
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
doing
that,
which
the
supreme
law
of
maryland
charges
him
with
the
responsibility
to
do
it.
it
is
besides
the
law
in
fact
for
the
case
and
is
your
constitution
not
the
supreme
law
of
your
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that’s
the
first
duty,
isn’t
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
and
say
we
are
not
going
to
do
it.
we
are
not
going
to
do
it,
because
some
judge
told
us
he
didn’t
want
us
to
follow
the
constitution,
didn’t
want
us
to
exercise
the
right
of
constitution
for
that,
who
is
right,
the
judge
or
the
jury?
