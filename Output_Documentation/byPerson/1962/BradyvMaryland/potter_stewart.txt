stewart
if
that
were
not
true
would
you
have
any
case
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
but
under
the
laws,
it's
understood
by
lawyers
if
not
by
juries
in
maryland,
it's
clear
that
this
man
was
guilty
of
the
first
degree
murder,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
murdered.
he
was
participating
in
the
â€“
what
was
it,
a
robbery?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
bamberger,
do
i
understand
that
--
then
that
in
every
felony
murder
case
it
would
be
hard
for
the
court
not
to
charge
on
the
second
degree
murder
and
manslaughter
as
well
as
giving
you
a
charge
of
felony
murder?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
that
the
practice
universally
in
--
where
the
only
evidence
is
that
there
was
murder
committed
--
the
killing
in
--
while
committing
a
felony
and
that's
the
only
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
still
error
for
the
court
not
to
charge
on
manslaughter
or
second
degree
murder?
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
doubt
--
as
i
read
this
last
paragraph
of
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
opinion,
what
it
does
is
--
as
i
understand
it,
is
to
say
that
the
trial
court
did
commit
error
in
this
case,
because
this
was
only
a
first
degree
murder
case.
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
say
explicitly
so,
but
it
does
say
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
isn't
that
matter
of
maryland
law
not
federal
law,
and
aren't
we
bound
by
what
the
highest
court
in
a
state
says
is
the
law
of
maryland?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
implicitly
i
thought
it
should
be
the
one.
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
you
reading
from?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
jamison
what
happens
in
maryland
if
a
man
pleads
guilty
to
the
first-degree
murder
or
doesn't
that
really
happen?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
doesn't
get
a
jury
trial
on
that
punishment?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
a
function
of
a
single
judge,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
wanted
to
shoot
him
and
brady
wanted
to
strangle
him.
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
jury
rule
on
the
admissibility
of
evidence?
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
ever
any
such
thing
as
a
directed
verdict
or
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
in
maryland
practice?
justice
potter
stewart
in
civil
litigation?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
in
that
case
the
judge
takes
it
away
from
the
jury
if
he
grants
the
motion.
justice
potter
stewart
the
statement
we
are
talking
about
appears
at
page
nine
of
the
record,
does
it,
that's
the
one,
statement
number
five?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
this
is
the
one,
this
is
statement
number
five,
i
think.
