mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
one
thread
follows
throughout
the
proceedings
in
this
case
and
that
is
that
the
defendant,
brady,
the
appellant
here,
has
consistently
and
universally
admitted
that
he
participated
in
the
robbery,
in
which
mr.
william
brooks
was
murdered.
during
the
preparation
for
the
trial
of
the
case
in
the
circuit
court
of
anne
arundel
county,
brady's
attorney
had
a
conference
with
the
state
attorney
and
in
the
judge's
chambers
and
also
with
the
counsel
for
the
accomplice
named
boblit
and
it
appears
on
page
26
of
the
record,
mr.
wolfel,
the
counsel
said,
i
recall
i
stated
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
they
took
a
jury
trial,
i
wanted
mine
first,
actually
the
accomplice
didn't
take
a
jury
trial,
then
he
went
on
to
say
and
that
the
case
would
be
limited
to
penalty
for
murder
in
the
first
degree.
question;
well
why
would
it
be
limited
to
that
penalty
sir?
answer;
because
that
was
absolutely
no
justification
or
reason
or
rhythm
or
rhyme
for
killing
a
man,
and
both
of
them
were
at
least
engaged
in
robbery
or
larceny
and
so
forth.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
i'm
reading
from
the
bottom
of
page
26
of
the
record
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
this
was
the
attorney,
who
represented
brady
at
his
trial,
referring
to
a
conference
between
the
attorney
for
the
co-defendant
or
the
accomplice
and
the
court
and
the
court's
chambers.
discussing
his
strategy
prior
to
the
trial
and
he
says
at
the
bottom
of
the
question
number
25
and
that
the
case
would
be
limited
to
penalty
for
murder
in
the
first
degree.
over
on
page
27,
there
is
some
further
discussion
at
that
point.
now
this
was
the
attitude
of
counsel
before
the
trial
started.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
your
honor,
the
case
was
tried
of
course
under
a
plea
of
not
guilty,
but
i
do
submit
that
under
--
the
record
as
shown
in
the
record
here,
the
case
was
not
really
tried
on
a
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
that's
true.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
and
i
think
that
is
supported
by
a
comment
made
by
the
court
in
its
instructions,
which
appears
on
page
42
of
the
record,
near
the
top
of
the
page,
where
the
court
says,
i
think
it's
the
third
sentence,
“and
the
court
feels
that
even
though
there
has
been
a
confession
by
a
counsel
for
the
defendant,
that
this
[inaudible]
is
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
without
capital
punishment,”
the
court
filled
the
jury
and
order
and
so
forth.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
that's
what
the
court
is
saying
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
what
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
there
has
been
really
no
controversy
about
guilt
in
this
case.
there
never
has
been
any
controversy
about
it,
and
the
statement
of
the
accomplice,
of
which
brady
was
deprived,
his
counsel
was
deprived
before
the
trial,
and
which
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
did
say
that
deprived
him
due
process
of
law,
this
statement
beginning
on
page
39,
of
the
record,
clearly
does
not
exonerate
him
from
guilt
of
first
degree
murder.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statement,
which
exonerates
him
from
guilt
of
felony
murder.
it
admits
that
brady
was
the
one
who
knew
mr.
brooks,
that
brady
was
the
one
who
said
we've
got
kill
mr.
brooks
and
brady
was
the
one
who
said
we've
got
the
strangle
mr.
brooks.
the
only
thing
in
the
statement,
which
has
any
--
which
provides
any
support
for
the
appellant
here
is
the
admission
by
boblit.
that
he,
boblit,
actually
strangled
the
decedent
and
it
is
the
state's
position
that
this
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence,
but
only
on
the
question
of
punishment.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
your
honor,
i
think
in
view
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
in
this
case
there
is
considerable
doubt
that
it
would
have
been
ruled
inadmissible.
it
may
very
well
have
been
decided
to
be
admissible.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
it
might
have
been
you
honor.
the
court
in
my
--
as
i
read
this
opinion
is
not
entirely
clear
that
it
could
have
been
admitted.
i
think
however
that
probably
the
opinion
says
it
could
have
been,
what
the
court
says
is
we
think
that
boblit's
undisclosed
confession
might
have
been
usable
under
any
one
of
the
three
and
it
didn't
say
it
would
have
been
usable,
but
it
might
have
said
if
it
had
so
desired.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
there
are
a
number
of
cases,
and
the
one
which
the
court
relies
upon
most
in
its
opinion
is
the
thomas
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
which
would
indicate,
that
for
certain
purposes
this
could
have
been
admitted.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
well,
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
but
i
do
think
that
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
fact
it
could
have
been
used
even
if
it
wasn't
admitted.
it
might
have
been
used
for
one
purpose
or
another
without
being
offered
in
evidence.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
boblit
did
not
testify
at
brady's
trial
your
honor,
no.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
under
error
of
law,
the
court
must
give
advisory
instructions
when
requested
to
do
so,
that's
the
first
one.
now,
as
i
understand
the
question,
it
is
--
if
these
specific
instructions
had
been
requested
and
the
court
had
refused
to
grant
these
specific
instructions,
would
that
have
been
error?
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
your
honor,
i
did
not
know
of
any
case
in
maryland,
which
would
require
the
five
possible
verdict
type
instructions
in
a
felony
murder
case.
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
court
could
have
given
an
instruction
that
the
jury
could
find
guilt
of
first
degree
murder
with
capital
punishment
or
without
capital
punishment
or
not
guilty,
but
as
i
say,
i
don't
know
of
any
change
to
that
rules
specifically
on
the
point.
now
after
the
trial
of
the
--
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
that's
–
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
well
your
honor,
the
contention
was
raised
on
appeal.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
on
appeal,
but
i
don't
think
it
was
seriously
pressed
at
the
trial.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
it's
not
my
understanding
of
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
it
is
now,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
well,
this
case,
certainly
i
think
i
must
admit,
said
so.
it
says
that
an
out
of
court
confession
made
by
a
third
party
is
admissible.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
no
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
know
of
any
case
in
maryland
in
which
that
point
has
arisen.
i
suspect
that
there
might
well
be
a
lot
of
dispute
over
that
question
on
the
part
of
the
defense.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
before
the
recess,
i
had
sought
to
establish
two
facts
which
i
believe
must
be
considered
during
the
study
of
this
case.
first
of
all,
the
statement
of
the
confederate,
boblit,
contains
nothing,
which
would
exculpate
brady
from
guilt
of
first-degree
murder
under
the
maryland
felony
murder
statute.
it
merely
contains
the
assertion
or
the
admission
that
boblit
himself
actually
strangled
the
victim,
but
it
places
brady
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
as
the
man
who
knew
brooks,
as
the
man
who
said,
“we
have
got
to
kill
brooks,”
as
the
man
who
said
“we've
have
got
to
strangle
brooks.”
secondly,
the
attorney
representing
john
brady
determined
before
the
trial
even
began
that
the
real
issue
in
the
trial
was
not
guilt
or
innocence,
but
penalty
for
murder
in
the
first-degree.
in
other
words,
he
sought
to
persuade
the
jury
to
bring
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
first-degree
murder
without
capital
punishment.
now,
at
the
trial
of
the
case,
brady
took
the
stand
and
again
brady
admitted
as
he
had
in
his
statements,
which
he
had
given
to
the
police
prior
to
his
trial,
he
again
admitted
he
had
participated
in
the
robbery,
but
denied
he
had
actually
committed
the
homicide.
in
his
--
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
a
man
pleads
guilty
to
first-degree
murder
then
the
court
would
have
the
option
as
to
whether
or
not
to
sentence
him
to
death
or
to
sentence
him
to
life
imprisonment.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
he
would
not
have
a
jury
trial.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
that's
correct
your
honor,
it's
merely
a
question
of
sentence.
the
closing
argument
or
at
least
the
--
the
closing
argument
to
the
jury
by
a
counsel
for
brady
consisted
of
a
confession
of
guilt
of
first-degree
murder.
now
when
brady
again
went
to
court
himself
to
testify
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
before
the
circuit
court
for
anne
arundel
county,
he
again
admitted
his
guilt
of
first
degree
murder.
he
admitted
that
he
was
there
and
he
participated
in
the
robbery.
he
admitted
the
facts
which
constitute
first-degree
murder
on
the
statute.
so
--
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
that
point
was
raised
in
brady's
appeal
from
his
conviction.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
i
stand
corrected
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
bamberger
reminds
me
of
boblit's
appeal
that
actually
raised
that
point.
they
were
tried
--
they
were
argued
together,
the
two
appeals
were
tried
under
one
argument.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
apparently
not
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
but
at
any
rate
this
point
was
brought
up
at
the
post-conviction
hearing.
now
throughout
the
other
proceedings
in
this
case,
it
had
never
been
controverted
that
brady
has
always
admitted
his
presence
at
the
trial
--
at
the
robbery
and
his
participation
in
the
robbery
and
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
remember
that
there
was
a
judicial
confession
in
effect
at
his
trial
when
brady
admitted
his
presence
and
his
participation.
now,
in
view
of
these
facts
and
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
states
that
nothing
in
--
well,
this
withheld
confession
this
appears
on
page
52
of
the
record,
nothing
in
it
could
have
reduced
the
appellant
brady's
offense
below
murder
in
the
first
degree.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
it
was
made
prior
to
the
trial
at
a
conference
in
the
judge's
chambers
with
counsel
for
a
coconspirator
or
the
confederate
and
they
were
discussing
various
aspects
such
as
we
have
a
jury
trial,
which
defendant
will
be
tried
first
and
so
forth
and
at
that
time,
counsel
for
brady
said
that
his
trial
would
be
limited
to
penalty
for
murder
in
the
first-degree.
now,
in
maryland,
the
constitution
provides
that
the
jury
is
the
judge
of
the
law
as
well
as
the
facts.
this
provision
has
been
in
the
constitution
of
maryland
at
least
since
1867
i
think
and
to
my
knowledge
has
never
been
applied
in
exactly
the
way
it
is
sought
to
be
applied
in
this
case,
but
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
in
a
recent
case,
giles
versus
state
said
this.
“it
is
the
duty
of
a
jury
to
decide
a
case
according
to
the
established
rules
of
law.”
in
all
frankness,
i
must
admit
that
this
statement
was
made
from
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
dealing
the
duty
of
the
jury
from
the
standpoint
of
the
defendant
other
than
the
standpoint
of
the
state,
but
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
duty
of
the
jury
is
the
same
whether
it
acquits
the
defendant
or
convicts
him,
it
is
nevertheless
the
duty
of
a
jury
to
decide
the
case
according
to
the
established
rules
of
the
law,
in
spite
of
this
constitutional
provision.
otherwise,
we
would
have
nothing
but
chaos.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
the
state
of
maryland's
position
that
the
trial
judge
charge
was
an
error
that
he
went
further
than
the
law
required.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
no
prep
just
whatsoever.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
yes
your
honor.
that's
exactly
what
they
said,
i
think
in
their
opinions,
what
they
held
in
their
opinion.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
giles
was
decided
after
this
case
and
i
might
say
that
the
giles
case,
there
is
a
petition
for
certiorari
pending
at
the
present
time.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
you
do.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
no,
mr.
justice
black.
i'm
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
that
it
is
the
duty
of
a
jury
to
decide
a
case
according
to
the
established
rules
of
law.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
the
constitution
says,
the
jury
is
the
judge
of
the
law
as
one
of
the
fact.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
no,
i
do
not.
what
i'm
saying
though
is
that
although
the
jury
has
the
right
to
decide
the
law,
they
have
the
duty
to
decide
the
law
according
to
their
conscience,
according
to
reason,
according
to
their
best
efforts
and
not
according
to
some
whim
or
fancy.
they
have
the
same
duty
to
decide
the
law
as
the
trial
judge
would
have
to
interpret
the
law
according
to
their
best
ability
and
not
to
ignore
the
law,
or
disregard
the
law,
or
twist
the
law
for
some
purpose
or
other.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
it
is
my
opinion
that
it
adds
very
little
to
the
power
of
a
jury
or
to
the
--
what
it
would
ordinarily
be
the
case
in
other
jurisdictions.
it
maybe
that
when
the
constitutional
prevision
was
enacted,
the
idea
was
to
give
a
great
scope
of
authority
to
the
jury,
but
i
believe
that
in
view
of
the
two
recent
cases,
the
giles
case
and
the
brady
case,
the
court
of
appeals
has
indicated
that
it
feels
there
was
a
very
limited
scope
to
this
provision.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
they
have
construed
the
constitution,
that
all.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
i
don't
believe
that
is
correct.
i
think
the
jury
has
the
right
to
interpret
the
law
and
if
it
makes
a
mistake
no
one
can
again
say
it.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
i
think
that
is
the
law,
now
it's
true
--
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
yes
i
believe
that
is
my
position.
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
indicated
in
the
giles
case
that
the
constitutional
provision
is
not
as
broad
as
it
might
be
thought
to
be
upon
reading
it.
i
think
that
the
jury
has
a
duty
to
construe
the
law
the
same
as
a
judge
would
construe
a
law,
it
was
best
of
its
ability
and
not
whimsically.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
there
has
been
an
effort
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
believe
that
the
current
session
of
the
legislature,
such
a
measure
was
introduced
and
it
was
not
enacted,
i
don't
know
whether
its
been
defeated
or
whether
it's
still
pending,
but
i
think
there
was
one
enacted,
i
mean
introduced.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
i
honestly
don't
know
whether
there
have
been
others
or
not.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
no
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
say
that.
i'm
merely
saying
that
there
is
not
the
distinction
between
the
situation
in
maryland
and
situation
in
other
states
which
would
appear
on
the
face
of
the
maryland
constitution.
the
jury
is
the
judge
of
the
law,
but
they
have
a
duty
to
judge
the
law
conscientiously
in
good
faith,
sincerely
and
legitimately
and
not
whimsically,
and
if
they
do
--
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
we
have
no
remedy.
if
they
act
according
to
whim
and
caprice
and
acquit
the
defendant,
the
defendant
is
acquitted,
and
there
is
no
remedy.
they
have
the
power
--
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
that
is
correct.
so
they
have
the
power
to
do
this
and
that
cannot
be
denied,
but
any
jury
has
the
power
to
do
this.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
i
don't
think
that
there
is
such
a
presumption
under
the
maryland
law.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
they
do
not,
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
that
is
our
position
exactly.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
i'm
saying
that
they
have
--
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
no.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
to
liable?
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
i
honestly
don't
know
mr.
justice
black.
i'm
not
familiar
with
laws
of
maryland
pertaining
to
liable.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
i
can't
help
you
on
that
point.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
not
only
is
customary,
but
i
think
it's
mandatory.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
well
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
getting
my
point
really
across
as
well
i
would
like.
it's
a
very
thin
distinction,
i
admit,
but
the
jury
does
have
the
right
under
the
constitution
to
interpret
the
law,
to
find
the
law
if
you
like.
all
i'm
saying
is
they've
got
to
do
it
honestly,
conscientiously,
intelligently
to
the
--
according
to
their
best
efforts
and
they
cannot
do
it
according
to
whim
and
if
they
do
it
according
to
the
whim,
then
they
are
violating
their
duty
to
the
state,
to
the
people.
now
if
they
do
that,
if
they
violate
their
duty
there
is
no
way
that
anybody
can
do
anything
about
it.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
i
don't
believe
i
am.
i
think
i
am
merely
relying
upon
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
in
the
giles
case.
and
although
they
said
it
there
in
reference
to
the
duty
of
the
jury
that
it
owes
to
the
defendant.
i
think
the
same
duty
is
owed
to
the
state.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
that
is
exactly
our
position.
that
no
jury
acting
in
good
faith
could
possibly
under
the
facts
of
this
peculiar
case,
could
possibly
have
rendered
any
verdict
except
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
or
not
guilty
of
anything
at
all.
but
since
there
was
a
judicial
confession
in
court
by
the
defendant,
the
jury
really
could
not
bring
in
a
verdict
of
not
guilty.
however,
the
court
--
the
trial
judge
was
entitled
at
the
trial
to
instruct
the
jury
that
they
could
bring
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
of
first
degree
murder,
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
without
capital
punishment
or
not
guilty.
on
the
facts
of
the
record
as
it
stands
now
however,
in
view
of
all
the
facts
and
the
way
in
which
the
trial
was
conducted,
it
is
our
position
that
the
defendant
was
not
denied
due
process
of
law
by
being
given
a
new
trial
on
the
issue
of
punishment
only.
since
this
is
the
sole
point
to
which
his
claim
of
prejudice
relates.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
it
would
have
been,
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
he
is
not
--
now
he
had
not
had
this
confession
or
this
statement
of
boblit
before
a
jury
before
he
was
tried.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
this
is
correct.
our
position
on
that
is
this,
that
there
was
no
prejudice,
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
statement
which
could
have
reduced
the
offense
below
first
degree
murder.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
statement
which
could
possibly
lead
the
jury
to
believe
he
was
as
an
innocent
bystander.
the
statement
says
that
it
was
brady's
idea
to
kill
him.
it
was
brady's
idea
to
strangle
him.
now
--
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
that's
exactly,
yes.
so
the
jury
couldn't
possibly
get
any
sympathy
for
the
man
out
of
this
statement.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
i
think
it
was
harmless
error
from
the
standpoint
of
guilt
or
innocence,
but
not
from
the
standpoint
of
punishment.
it
might
have
persuaded
the
jury
to
recommend
without
capital
punishment,
and
that
is
exactly
the
relief
that
he
has
been
granted
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
yes
it
is
difficult.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
no
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
the
jury
in
maryland
does
not
rule
on
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute,
it
does
not
rule
on
the
admissibility
of
evidence
and
in
the
first
instance
it
does
not
rule
on
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession,
although
after
the
judge
plans
a
confession
to
be
voluntary,
then
the
jury
in
turn
is
on
the
point.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
yes,
there
certainly
is.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
yes,
that's
correct,
but
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
has
a
right
to
move
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal
at
the
conclusion
of
the
state's
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
jamison,
iii
well,
i
never
heard
it
done
personally,
but
i
have
heard
that
there
have
been
times
when
a
judge
indicated
dissatisfaction
with
the
verdict,
but
this
has
no
real
legal
significance.
