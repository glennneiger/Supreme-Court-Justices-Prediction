justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
tell
me
this
mr.
bamberger,
the
lawyer
can
expect
instructions
that
some
lesser
offense
might
find
him
guilty
of
some
lesser
offense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
--
if
that's
so
i
take
it
the
exclusion
of
this
testimony
then
might
indeed
be
prejudicial,
might
it
not,
under
your
curious
system
of
jury,
judge,
the
law?
in
fact,
they
might
have
believed
that
where
they
totally
could
find
guilt
of
a
lesser
offense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bamberger,
may
i
ask
this
looking
at
page
52?
what
was
meant
by
the
court
in
that
opening
sentence
of
the
first
full
paragraph?
the
appellant's
sole
claim
of
prejudice
goes
to
the
“punishment?”
is
this
is
a
suggestion
that
the
only
thing
before
the
court
raised
by
the
appellant's
right,
and
should
not
be
that
but
only
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
could
you
see
what
i'm
reaching
for?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
possible
that
counsel
at
this
--
a
statement
by
a
court
of
appeals
that
the
only
issue
before
that
raised
by
the
appellant
goes
to
punishment
and
not
to
the
guilt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
there
again
i
take
it
felony
murder
is
an
offense
under
your
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
i
gather
in
the
trial
of
the
felony
murder,
the
strange
business
of
jury
being
judge
of
law
and
fact,
it
may
nevertheless
where
the
state's
proofs
would
support
a
conviction
of
felony
murder,
because
it
is
the
judge
of
law
and
fact,
nevertheless
return
a
verdict
which
is
not
for
felony
murder.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
let
me
see
if
i
followed
that.
i
remember
under
my
state
practice,
it
was
not
where
the
jury
assesses
the
penalty
of
death
or
life
imprisonment,
and
where
the
recommendation
of
the
jury
is
binding
on
the
judge
and
then
frequently
a
case
would
be
tried
solely
on
it,
they
persuade
the
jury
to
bring
in
life
rather
than
death
sentence.
and
there
would
be
no
legal
controversy
at
all
over
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
now
are
you
suggesting
that
practice
was
the
way
this
case
was
tried,
that
defense
counsel
wasn't
raising
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
what
i'm
asking?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
--
to
me
what
that's
saying
is
the
judge
says
he
doesn't
care
how
the
defense
counsel
wants
to
try
it,
and
he
had
to
instruct
the
jury
that
they
might
bring
any
one
of
five
verdicts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
boblit

at
the
trial?
