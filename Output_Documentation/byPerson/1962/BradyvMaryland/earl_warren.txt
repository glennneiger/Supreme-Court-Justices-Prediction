number
490,
john
l.
brady,
petitioner
versus
maryland.
mr.
bamberger.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
a
matter
of
first
impression
with
the
court
at
this
time
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
hadn't
occurred
in
any
other
case
prior
to
that
for
precise
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
malton
--
oh
mr.
jamison,
excuse
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
who
is
speaking?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wasn't
there
some
contention
in
this
case
that
the
murder
was
committed
after
the
robbery
and
that
therefore
it
wasn't
felony
murder?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
be
the
reason
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
that
kind
of
instruction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
appeal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
at
the
trial
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it
be
admissible
against
brady
as
well
as
for
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
will
adjourn
now
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
-
490,
john
l.
brady,
petitioner
versus
maryland.
mr.
jamison,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
also
that
the
murder
was
committed
at
the
time
of
the
robbery,
not
later,
is
that
correct,
because
i
did
notice
some
place
along
the
line
here
where
it
was
contended
that
the
murder
was
detached
from
the
robbery
itself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
not
at
the
trial,
i
think
you
answered
that
yesterday?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see
and
brady
did
not
raise
it
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may,
i
ask
you
just
one
more
thing
before
you
get
into
another
phase
of
the
case?
on
page
26,
item
25
that
we
talked
about
yesterday
somewhat,
would
you
mind
telling
me
when
that
statement
was
made
by
counsel
for
the
defendant
and
in
want
context
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jamison
is
it
customary
in
maryland
in
cases
of
this
kind
to
instruct
--
for
the
judge
when
he
instructs
the
jury
to
tell
them
that
his
instructions
are
only
advisory
and
they
may
decide
the
law
in
anyway
that
they
desire.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
what
you
just
argued
to
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
aren't
you
confusing
power
and
duty?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bamberger
before
you
get
your
main
argument
i'd
like
to
ask
you
this
question.
in
the
event
we
were
to
affirm
this
judgment.
in
what
respect
would
you
be
in
a
different
position?
if
you
go
back
on
the
question
of
punishment,
then
you
were
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
and
the
reason
i
ask
you
that
question
is
because
of
what
occurred
here
on
page
26
of
the
record
and
i
think
you
were
testifying
at
the
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
you
were
not,
so
counsel
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it
starts
this
way.
now
do
you
remember
participating
in
the
conference
prior
to
brady's
trial
in
judge
michelson's
office?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
was
present
then
sir.
it
was
judge
michelson,
mr.
stowes,
mr.
turk,
mr.
deboe
and
myself,
i
think
that
was
all.
i
don't
think
the
assistant
state's
attorney
was
there
all
day.
what
was
discussed
at
that
conference?
answer:
quite
a
number
of
things,
what
we
wanted
to
go
to
trial,
what
day
we
wanted
to
go
to
trial,
and
how
we
elected
trial.
and
i
recall
i
stated
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
they
took
a
jury
trial,
i
wanted
my
mine
first
and
that
the
case
would
be
limited
to
penalty
for
murder
in
the
first-degree.
well,
why
would
it
be
limited
to
that
penalty
sir?
answer;
because
there
was
absolutely
no
justification
or
reasons,
or
rhythm,
or
rhyme
for
killing
a
man
and
both
of
them
were
at
least
engaged
in
robbery
or
larceny
which
is
a
felony
and
understanding
of
law
if
both
of
them
involved
in
the
felony.
and
there
was
an
objection
to
him
explaining
the
law
and
it
was
overruled
and
the
witness,
the
counsel
went
on
and
said
and
both
of
them
were
in
fact
committing
a
felony,
they
were
charged
each
with
a
greater
offense
and
one
of
them
committing
murder
which
everyone
of
them
--
it
was
--
would
be,
would
automatically
charge
the
other
one
with
murder.
and
then
i
understand
that
brady
after
that
testified
that
he
did
participate
in
the
robbery
and
the
murder.
now,
how
or
in
what
respect
will
you
injured
if
you
in
fact
to
have
his
punishment
only
determined
in
the
light
of
that
approach
that
was
made
at
his
original
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
counsel
apparently
knew
the
facts
at
least
as
he
got
them
from
his
client
brady
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
said
that
the
only
issue
was
the
issue
of
punishment
because
his
client
had
clearly
committed
first-degree
murder
under
any
reading
of
the
facts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
recall
mr.
bamberger
how
this
case
was
argued?
did
the
counsel
for
brady
concede
on
the
argument
after
brady’s
testimony
that
he
had
participated
in
the
robbery?
did
he
concede
on
the
argument
that
brady
was
guilty
of
first-degree
murder,
but
that
he
should
not
receive
the
maximum
penalty?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bamberger,
you
happen
to
recall
what
oath
the
jury
takes
when
it’s
sworn
to
try
a
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
very
well.
