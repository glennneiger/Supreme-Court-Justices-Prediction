justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
regular
stock
suit,
isn't
it,
under
the
title
of
malicious
immaterial
--
the
contract
rather.
is
it
any
different
to
the
ordinary
suit
of
that
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
is
the
texas
law
different?
i
haven't
agreed
--
put
it
merely
with
that
particular
kind
of
a
lawsuit.
is
the
texas
law
different
to
that
in
the
other
states
which
is
to
this
effect,
it's
not
malice
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
--
if
you
do
not
prove
malice
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
ill
will
or
even
motive
but
that
it's
sufficient
to
have
a
legal
malice,
that
is
to
show
that
a
wrongful
conduct
occurred
which
brought
about
the
damage.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
think
so
either
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
you
were
discussing
it
and
i
seem
to
be
putting
some
emphasis
on
whether
it
was
malicious
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
had
understood
that
in
this
kind
of
enactment,
you
do
not
look
into
the
general
meaning
of
malice
if
some
person
wants
--
very
anxious
to
do
somebody
wrong
because
of
hatred
or
envy
or
malice
or
something,
but
is
simply
that
he's
done
a
wrong
and
the
law
enforced
malice
in
this
particular
kind
of
action
from
that
wrongful
conduct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
saying
now,
i
assume
is,
that
if
the
federal
law
does
authorize
as
remedy
to
farther
extend
under
the
act,
fix
the
amount,
texas
can't
use
a
state
remedy
in
order
to
add
to
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
in
this
case
that
this
man
had
a
remedy
before
the
labor
board
and
that
the
labor
board
could
--
it
could
establish
wrong
has
been
done
that
the
labor
board
could
have
awarded
back
pay
as
damage.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
concede
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
it
was
privileged
under
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
if
it
was
privileged
conduct
under
the
act,
the
board
--
neither
the
board
and
other
states
could
give
a
remedy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
they
go
beyond
that
privilege
which
the
act
gives
them
then
the
board
can
give
a
remedy
for
the
wrongful
conduct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
argument
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
could
you
finish,
that
isn't
what
was
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wasn't
it
alright
to
raise
it
by
plea
in
abatement?
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
either
event,
i
presume,
even
if
there's
preemption,
they
would
still
be
free
to
try
out
the
issue
of
whether
they
were
guilty
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
i
--
i
still
probably
due
to
my
fault
but
i
still
don't
understand
where
you
get
by
this
particular
argument
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they've
contended
they
were
not
but
they've
also
contended,
have
they
not,
as
to
issues
as
to
whether
they
had
or
not
but
one
for
the
board,
and
that
was
properly
raised
by
a
plea
in
abatement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
(voice
overlap)
--
did
they
quite
admit
that?
i
thought
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
what
they
admitted
was
that
if
what
you
charged
was
true,
they
had
committed
an
unfair
labor
act
but
did
not
admit
whether
the
charge
was
true.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
the
question
is
who
should
have
found
those
facts,
the
jury
or
the
board?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
they're
saying
is
that
whatever
the
--
whether
the
finding
was
right
or
wrong,
it
can't
be
accepted
because
that
was
for
the
board
to
find
and
not
for
the
jury.
