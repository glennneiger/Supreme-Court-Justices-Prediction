what
the
--
what
is
the
arguable
(inaudible)
under
what
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
the
8
(a)
(3)
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
that
time
that
was
against
the
employer,
was
it?
justice
byron

white
8
(b)
(2)
then
or
8
(b)
(3)
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
8
(b)
(1)
and
(2).
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
do
you
think
your
case
really
is
substantially
distinguishable
to
the
cases
which
the
union
had
attached
to
their
reply
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i'm
not
sure
you've
got
the
--
it
got
to
do
with
distinguishing
these
two
cases,
the
(inaudible)
case
and
the
walker
case,
that's
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we
simply
found
that
the
employer
had
to
have
it
or
it
was
the
festive
of
hiring
only
through
the
hiring
hall.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
only
in
the
--
and
based
their
finding,
mostly
on
the
fact
that
the
union
member
who
was
complaining,
had
been
told
by
the
employer,
he
wouldn't
be
hired
unless
he
was
referred.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
that
then
--
which
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
can't
be
covered
though
you
--
you
couldn't
recover
at
any
court,
could
you,
without
showing
that
--
without
showing
that
the
union
really
was
of
the
operative
factor
and
your
client
must
recover
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
being
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
which
is
--
which
is
establishing
precisely
what
the
board
had
found
to
be
true
in
these
two
cases,
namely
that
the
--
the
employer
had
enough
regard
to
what
the
union
thought
at
least
that
it
passively
was
in
agreement,
would
it,
not
to
hire,
unless
there
was
a
referral.
