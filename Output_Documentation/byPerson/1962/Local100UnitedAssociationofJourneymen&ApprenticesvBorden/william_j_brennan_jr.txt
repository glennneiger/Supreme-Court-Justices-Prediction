well,
under
texas
law,
does
the
finding
in
malice
a
requisite
for
an
award
of
punitive
trust
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering,
are
we
--
are
we
to
suppose
that
the
punitive
damages
rest
on
some
finding
in
malice
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
it's
not
material
of
the
issue
that
you're
presenting.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
from
what
you
said
earlier,
having
failed
to
file
a
charge
within
the
record,
the
six-month
period.
if
you're
right,
this
fellow's
out,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
must
say
in
my
state,
we
do
distinguish
malice
as
they're
defined
under
willfully
from
actual
malice.
that
is
under
our
rule,
at
least,
only
so-called
legal
malice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
none
at
all
--
