mr.
robert
weldon
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
the
supreme
court.
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
yours,
mr.
justice
black,
yes,
there
was
legal
wrong
done
here
and
the
texas
courts
have
found
that
was
malicious.
in
the
court's
charge
to
the
jury,
on
number
seven
which
is
in
the
record
on
page
62,
the
court
defines
the
term
‘willfully'
as
used
in
this
charge
to
mean
the
intentional
and
purposeful
disregard
of
the
known
rights
of
another.
then
drawing
your
attention
to
the
special
issue
number
five,
the
court
inquired
as
to
whether
the
action
taken
against
borden
was
done
willfully
to
which
the
jury
answered
yes.
it
was
on
this
foundation
that
the
court
based
the
finding
of
exemplary
damage,
the
intentional
disregard
of
the
known
rights
of
another.
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
well,
in
texas,
sir,
there
is
no
distinction,
the
willful
or
--
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
--
malicious
action
taken
is
treated
the
same.
the
legal
remedy
to
which
judge
black
--
justice
black,
i
think
referred,
applies
in
texas.
now,
to
begin
with,
mr.
borden
was
a
member
of
both
the
local
union
100
and
the
united
association
at
the
time
of
this
trial.
local
100
in
dallas
is
a
member
of
the
parent
organization,
united
association.
suit
was
originally
brought
against
both,
the
parent
and
the
local
union.conspiracy
was
charged
against
both
unions
in
breach
of
contract
against
mr.
borden
as
well
as
the
commission
of
authority.
later
on,
during
the
progress
of
the
trial,
the
united
association,
on
motion
by
the
court,
was
dismissed
from
the
action
and
is
no
longer
in
the
case.
i
thought
i'd
bring
that
to
the
court's
attention
this
time.
now,
mr.
borden
did
work
in
galveston
for
the
farwell
construction
company.
he
was
a
member
of
a
local
union
in
galveston
which
is
also
a
member
of
the
united
association.
after
leaving
galveston,
he
did
come
to
dallas
to
attempt
to
get
a
job.
now,
in
the
united
association,
if
a
man
has
a
dues
book,
he
may
automatically
become
a
member
of
that
particular
local
union
even
without
a
clearance
card.
if
he
has
a
clearance
card
from
his
previous
local
union,
he
may
also
become
a
member
of
the
new
local
union.
or
failing
to
have
either
of
these
indicia
of
membership,
he
may
deposit
$10
as
an
evidence
of
good
faith,
and
then
maybe
referred
out
on
the
job
as
any
other
member
of
the
local
union.and
it
is
the
union's
responsibility
to
obtain
his
clearance
card.
mr.
borden
arrived
in
dallas
around
september
the
15th.
he
called
to
farwell
construction
company
job
and
talked
to
mr.
heave.
after
he
talked
to
mr.
heave,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
as
to
what
was
said
between
the
two
of
them.
after
he
talked
to
mr.
heave,
he
went
to
the
local
union,
to
lanham
who
was
a
businessman,
who
had
the
duty
as
found
by
the
jury,
and
as
it
is
shown
in
the
constitution
and
bylaws
of
the
local
union
to
refer
the
man
out
on
the
job.
he
asked
mr.
lanham
for
a
job.
he
asked
specifically
to
be
referred
to
the
republic
bank
job.
mr.
lanham
refused,
he
cursed
him,
he
said
he
come
in
here
wrong,
he
came
in
with
the
job
in
his
pocket,
he
wasn't
going
to
send
him
out.
he
refused
to
accept
his
clearance
card.
now,
we're
not
basing
our
action
on
his
union
membership
rights
on
whether
or
not
they
accepted
the
clearance
card
this
time
contrary
to
what
mr.
wells
has
said.
because
later
on
and
we
have
admitted
in
our
pleadings
and
it
is
in
evidence,
they
did
accept
the
clearance
card
after
he
had
gone
back
to
shreveport
at
a
later
date
and
picked
up
the
clearance
card.
that
first
time
he
only
had
the
dues
book.
after
he
had
gone
back
and
picked
up
his
clearance
card
and
brought
it
back,
he
finally
did
find
lanham
and
did
give
it
to
him.
now,
it
took
him
about
six
days
during
his
entire
period
of
time
in
order
to
merely
be
enrolled
as
member,
but
that
is
not
the
real
issue.
now,
after
he
had
come
back
to
dallas
the
second
time
with
what
he
called
the
boss,
the
clearance
card,
he
presented
that
to
lanham
and
said
he
wanted
to
go
to
work
on
the
republic
bank
job.
and
in
the
meantime,
he
had
talked
to
mr.
thurman
who
was
not
the
sole
hiring
agent
on
the
job
but
was
a
superintendent
on
the
job
and
did
have
the
authority,
as
the
jury
found,
to
hire.
he
asked
mr.
thurman
to
place
a
call
for
him
with
the
local
union.
mr.
thurman
testified
that
he
did
do
so.
mr.
borden
went
to
the
union
and
this
time,
he
was
told
or
mr.
thurman
was
told
that
they
would
not
refer
mr.
borden
for
the
job
because
he
had
shoved
his
clearance
card
down
their
throats.
in
any
event,
mr.
borden
didn't
get
the
job
and
he
was
referred
down
on
several
other
jobs.
now,
the
jury
has
found,
one,
that
mr.
borden
had
a
job
opportunity
offered
to
him.
they
found
that
mr.
lanham
had
the
duty
under
the
rules
and
procedures.
he
had
a
duty
under
the
rules
and
procedures,
a
contract
prior
to
mr.
borden's
to
refer
mr.
borden
for
the
job,
and
that
he
willfully
violated
that
duty.
and
it's
on
this
basis
that
the
court
awarded
both
the
actual
and
the
exemplary
damages.
now,
in
answer
to
one
question
from
the
court
as
to
why
the
judge
reduced
the
exemplary
damages
from
$5000,
as
awarded
by
the
jury,
to
$1916
which
is
the
exact
amount
of
the
actual
damages,
i
can
only
answer
--
i
don't
know
except
that
i
think
that
he
thought
that
he
could
not
award
exemplary
damages
in
any
amount
greater
than
actual
damages.
we
contested
in
the
appeals
court
but
you
must
prove
a
gross
abuse
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court
in
ordering
remittitur
and
this
finding
of
the
court
was
upheld.
also,
we
contested
in
the
appeals
court
the
disallowance
by
the
trial
court
on
his
own
motion
of
the
$1500
mental
pain
and
suffering.
this
also
was
disallowed
by
the
appellate
--
appeals
court
on
the
grounds
once
again,
we
must
have
proof
gross
abuse
of
discretion
which
is
almost
impossible
to
prove.
now,
the
testimony
shows
that
mr.
borden
was
cursed,
he
was
abused.
he
was
kicked
from
teller
to
post.
it
also
shows
that
he
went
to
an
executive
board
meeting,
and
there
in
this
meeting,
they
told
mr.
borden
that
if
he
didn't
like
the
action
that
the
union
was
taken
against
him
that
they
could
take
away
his
clearance
card,
they
could
take
away
his
union
membership,
kick
him
out
of
the
union,
and
kick
him
out
of
dallas.
and
that
the
best
thing
he
could
do
would
be
to
forget
the
whole
matter
and
leave.
now,
mr.
borden
testified
that
after
this
meeting,
that
he
was
in
fear
of
bodily
harm
and
he
made
himself
scarce
around
the
union
hall
except
when
he
had
to
go
there
to
pay
dues.
now,
i
imagine
he
was
pretty
careful
about
that.
now,
this
action
is
not
based
in
anyway
on
the
labor
management
relations
act.
there
are
no
pleadings
by
borden
that
the
union
violated
any
provision
of
the
act.
no
contention
has
ever
been
made
that
the
act
in
anyway
is
involved
in
this
case
insofar
as
mr.
borden's
concern.
the
supreme
court
of
state
of
texas
as
mr.
wells
has
already
alluded
to
did
get
to
the
nub
of
this
case
in
the
first
appeal
when
it
said
on
page
34
of
the
record,
“according
to
the
petition,
it
was
lanham's
duty
to
place
the
members
of
the
union
with
their
various
job
opportunities,
a
duty
that
he
had,
a
contract
action.”
this
is
also
shown
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
civil
appeals
from
which
the
appeal
has
been
taken
to
this
court
where
the
court
stated,
“the
suit
of
borden
as
already
stated
was
based
on
both
contract
and
tort.”
this
is
on
page
350
of
the
record.
no
special
issue
was
submitted
to
the
jury
in
anyway
based
on
the
taft-hartley
act.
the
special
issues
submitted
were
solely
based
upon
duties
owed
to
mr.
borden
by
lanham
and
by
the
union.
special
issue
number
6
inquired
as
to
whether
lanham
breached
his
duty
to
borden
under
the
rules
and
procedures
of
local
100.
the
jury
answered,
“yes”,
failing
to
receive
an
affirmative
answer
on
this
particular
special
issue,
our
case
would
have
followed
and
mr.
borden
would
not
have
received
relief.
unless
we
approved
the
contract,
unless
we
approved
the
deal
on
lanham,
the
business
manager,
there
would
have
been
no
action.
there
is
no
special
issue
in
anyway
related
to
any
duties
owed
under
the
taft-hartley
act
only
under
the
rules
and
procedures
of
the
union.
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
it
is
my
view
that
it
would
not.
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
yes,
sir,
i
will
go
this
--
this
far.
it's
--
as
in
some
of
the
opinions
of
the
court
have
recognized,
gonzales,
one,
local
357
is
another.
in
any
situation
where
you
have
a
union
and
a
union
member
or
an
employer
or
in
anyway
involved,
you
can
abstractly
reason
around
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
act
somewhere,
and
i
suppose
you
can
do
the
same
thing
here.
but
as
a
direct
violation
of
the
act,
i
see
none.
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
mr.
justice
white,
it
is
our
duty
that
the
nlrb
and
particularly
in
the
miranda
fuel
case,
they
explained
in
detail
what
they
mean.
it's
going
on
the
assumption
that
where
you
have
a
certified
bargaining
agent,
a
majority
agent,
that
owes
the
duty
to
all
of
the
employees
and
the
union
refuses
to
refer
under
this
situation,
the
employer
cannot
hire.
under
this
situation,
the
duty
has
--
the
union
has
violated
a
duty
under
the
act,
and
therefore,
estimated
an
unfair
labor
practice.
going
further,
there
is
another
situation
where
the
union
threatens
the
employer
with
intimidation,
coercion,
and
other
activities
that,
“we
will
refuse
to
do
something
if
you
hire
this
man.”
then
in
that
situation,
you
would
also
have
a
violation
of
the
act
under
the
later
nlrb
decision.
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
well,
i
think
--
i
think
in
both
of
those
cases,
your
honor,
there
--
they
were
the
majority
agents
and
i
think
that
the
board
found
--
i'm
not
too
familiar
with
them,
i've
read
--
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
well,
it
did
establish
--
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
yes,
sir
and
--
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
no,
sir.
that's
not
exactly
what
happened.
in
that
case,
i
think
the
nlrb
did
find
that
there
was
an
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
employer
that
they
would
only
take
those
people
who
were
referred.
now,
the
nlrb
found
that
there
was
a
common
practice
and
that
this
is
what
had
been
done
in
the
past,
as
i
recall
it.
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
they
are
--
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
they
are
the
operating
the
factor.
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
yes,
sir,
and
i
think
it
goes
to
the
radio
officers'
case
and
also
to
local
357
wherein
the
court
found
that
it
was
a
true
motive
of
the
employer
in
not
hiring
in
which
the
board
must
look
that
the
failure
to
hire
by
itself
was
not
the
only
criteria,
but
if
they
had
an
agreement
that
they
would
only
hire
if
they
were
referred
by
the
union
then
in
that
event,
they
were
encouraging
union
membership
by
refusing
to
hire
and
by
refusing
to
refer.
i
think
that
would
be
the
distinction.
but
going
further,
the
union
has
never
pleaded
as
a
defense
except
by
a
way
of
a
plea
in
abatement
that
it
was
doing
anything
for
borden
to
encourage
or
discourage
union
membership
for
that
it
was
displaying
here.
in
the
trial
court,
the
union
contended
that
borden
had
never
been
refused
a
referral.
borden
had
always
been
treated
like
any
other
employees.
it
was
doubtedly
denied
that
anything
had
ever
happened
to
him.
there
was
no
error
affected
on
appeal
for
failure
to
submit
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
union
was
correct
in
taking
any
action
against
borden
whether
they
had
a
right
to
discipline
him,
whether
they
had
a
right
to
keep
him
from
referral.
no
supplemental
findings
were
ever
requested
or
error
perfected
on
the
same.
and
in
texas,
we
have
a
special
issue
system
where,
under
rule
275,
all
findings
of
the
court
are
presumed
in
favor
of
the
special
issues
unless
the
court
makes
other
findings.
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
that's
--
that's
all.
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
it
was
alright
to
raise
it
by
plea
in
abatement,
your
honor,
but
what
i
am
saying
is,
that
they
did
not
come
in
to
court
and
say,
“yes,
we
took
an
action
against
borden
for
this
reason
--
for
that
reason.”
the
only
thing
they
have
said
is,
“this
action
is
preempted
because
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
and
8
(b)
(2).
now,
they
have
pleaded
no
facts
to
support
this.
now,
i
assume
that
the
labor
union,
in
any
case,
is
always
going
to
plea
as
it
wrote
a
possibility
that
it
may
be
preempted
that
it's
preempted
by
the
act,
but
they
have
no
facts
under
that
showing
what
they
mean
by
any
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
legally
--
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
that's
legally
correct,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
well,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
they
have
never
contended
that
they
were
taking
any
action
against
mr.
borden.
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
that's
right.
yes,
sir.
now,
what
was
the
business
agent's
purpose
in
refusing
to
give
mr.
borden
a
job?
they
have
never
admitted
that
he
was
called
for
and
it
was
a
practice
for
11
years
in
this
union
that
if
a
man
was
called
for
by
name
that
he
was
referred
to
the
job.
yes,
they
did
say
it
one
time
after
the
evidence
kept
rolling
in
that
he
had
been
called
for
that
he
may
have
been
drunk
but
they
never
did
produce
a
witness
to
show
that
he
never
had
a
drink
for
over
10
years.
in
fact,
the
man
who
claimed
that
he
was
drunk
to
begin
with,
later
on
said,
no,
he
didn't
smell
anything
on
his
breath
and
he
doesn't
seem
to
me
drunk.
so
naturally,
this
testimony
was
discredited.
but
now
the
union
admits,
“yes,
we've
committed
a
violation
of
the
act.
now,
we've
missed
to
hold
with
our
hands
in
the
cookie
jar
and
we're
guilty
--
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
but
we're
not
guilty
under
this
law.”
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
sir?
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
well,
justice
black,
it's
beyond
that
point.
it's
what
the
jury
has
found.
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
well,
i
think
they
did
admit
in
their
--
in
their
brief
in
this
case
that
regardless
of
what
happened,
borden
was
being
disciplined
in
this
instance.
now,
i
don't
think
they
have
admitted
it
beyond
that
point
but
i
think
that
it
has
on
that
burden.
reliance
has
been
placed
upon
the
radio
officers'
case
to
show
that
this
case
is
similar
to
that
that
an
8
(b)
(2),
violation
has
been
committed.
in
that
case,
a
man
was
hired
first
and
then
fired
by
an
employer
pursuant
to
an
illegal
union
security
agreement.
and
back
to
what
justice
black
asked
awhile
ago,
in
that
situation,
the
court
found
that
by
discharging
the
man
pursuant
to
the
union
request
have
found
that
the
motive
of
the
employer
was
to
encourage
union
membership.
in
the
case
of
local
357,
which
was
a
hiring
all
case,
nlrb
versus
local
357,
the
majority
of
this
court,
some
affirmative
showing
of
motivation
of
encouragement
or
discouragement
must
be
shown
that
it
is
the
true
purpose
and
the
real
motive
of
the
employer
in
refusing
to
hire
which
is
at
issue.
the
concurring
opinion
said
that
it
was
the
forbidden
motivation
which
must
be
examined.
the
certified
bargaining
agent
has
the
duty
to
represent
all
the
employees'
fair
and
that
all
business
purposes
are
not
bad.
now,
the
only
thing
shown
in
this
record
is
that
mr.
borden
was
told
to
go
to
the
union
and
get
a
referral.
now,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
showing
that
mr.
borden
ever
went
back
and
tried
to
get
a
job
after
he
had
been
referred
to
the
union.
there
is
no
showing
of
that,
that
there
was
any
agreement
whatsoever
between
the
farwell
construction
company
and
the
union.
that
they
would
only
hire
men
referred
to
them
by
the
union.
and
in
fact
in
texas,
we
have
the
right
to
work
law
and
it
would've
been
illegal
anyway.
so,
there
is
no
motivation
shown
here
by
the
union.
the
union
claims
in
its
brief
that
the
record
is
insufficient
in
regard
to
hiring
arrangements
between
farwell
and
the
union
and
i
say
that
since
this
was
the
duty,
since
this
was
the
issue
raised
by
the
union,
that
they
had
the
burden
of
going
forward
to
show
that
this
was
an
action
which
should
have
been
considered
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
the
union
cannot
raise
on
one
hand
as
an
issue
that
this
is
preempted
by
the
act
and
hide
behind
the
skirts
without
going
further
and
showing
in
what
manner
it
does
come
within
the
purposes
of
the
act.
they
went
--
they
did
not
go
forward
where
they
act
at
all.
now,
next,
we
say
that
even
though,
even
though
it'd
be
considered
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
act
in
this
case,
not
admitting
but
assuming
that
it
be
found.
nonetheless,
the
texas
state
courts
had
jurisdiction.
the
state
courts
have
the
right
as
found
by
the
court
in
gonzales
to
vindicate
the
personal
rights
of
an
individual
on
the
contract.
now,
that
is
exactly
what
this
case
involves.
the
constitution
and
bylaw
of
section
30
of
the
union
constitution,
says,
that
a
man
will
not
take
a
job
without
a
referral
from
the
union.
to
do
so,
we'll
place
him
in
the
position
where
he
may
be
expelled
from
the
union.
mr.
borden
shows
not
to,
after
having
been
a
member
of
the
union
for
22
years,
place
his
retirement
and
pension
that
he
had
obtained
in
the
union
on
the
block
to
lose
all
of
his
union
rights
and
go
ahead
and
go
back
to
the
employer
and
ask
for
the
job
anyway.
we
have
pleaded
in
paragraph
15
specifically
that
this
was
a
violation
of
the
union
constitution
and
bylaws,
and
this
was
found
by
the
jury
in
answer
to
the
special
issue
number
six.
the
appeals
courts
have
treated
this
as
a
violation
of
contract.
texas
courts
have
long
recognized
and
--
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
your
honor,
i
think
it
has
not
been
affected
by
the
second
garmon
case.
the
court
in
that
case,
the
second
garmon,
recognized
the
validity
of
the
gonzales
case
that
in
situations
where
a
matter
is
of
peripheral
concern
to
the
act,
nonetheless,
the
state
courts
may
have
jurisdiction.
now,
this
assumed
that
it
may
also
be
a
violation
of
the
act,
but
that
it
is
a
fair
amount
of
right
for
the
state
to
go
ahead
and
take
consideration
of
the
case.
now,
i
think
the
garmon
case
goes
back
to
weber
and
garner.
the
court
in
the
garmon
case
clearly
considered
that
this
was
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(2).
in
fact,
they
found
in
the
first
instance
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
i
think
that
this
case
does
follow
clearly
within
gonzales.
as
i
said
before,
you
might
pick
out
a
violation
of
the
act
in
this
case,
but
nonetheless
--
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
well,
i
think
the
court
has
gone
further
and
said
that
it's
not
only
arguably
but
it
--
that
it
is
reasonably
arguable.
in
the
interlake
case,
the
court
used
the
word
reasonable.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
meant
that
ingenuity
of
counsel
is
paramount
in
saying
whether
or
not
a
case
should
go
before
the
nlrb.it
has
to
be
of
reasonable
argument,
surely.
and
what
i'd
like
to
point
out
further
is
that
the
proviso
to
section
8
(b)
(2)
or
8
(b)
(1)
as
congressional
history
in
93
congressional
record,
page
440
where
senator
ball
stated
that
it
was
never
the
intention
of
the
sponsors
of
the
pending
amendment,
that
is
the
proviso,
to
interfere
with
the
internal
affairs
of
organizations
of
the
union.
now,
this
does
not
refer
clearly
to
whether
a
man
has
been
expelled
from
the
union
or
whether
he's
been
denied
membership.
this
goes
to
all
of
the
internal
affairs.
senator
taft
said
the
same
thing.
he
said
that,
“although
the
union
may
be
wrong
and
that
under
the
act,
the
man
must
be
reemployed
by
an
employer,
nonetheless,
regardless
of
whether
the
man
did
a
rightful
act
or
wrongful
act,
the
union
can
discharge
him
from
membership.
and
that
the
act
does
not
cover.
now,
that's
what
this
case
is
based
upon.
this
man
had
rights
within
the
union.
what
is
the
difference
if
a
man
is
expelled
from
the
union,
if
he
is
suspended
from
the
union,
or
if
he's
merely
kept
within
the
union
but
denied
on
union
rights?
and
that's
what
happened
in
this
instance.
if
you
say
that
a
man
must
be
expelled
from
the
union
first
before
he
may
take
action,
then
will
not
the
union
just
keep
the
man
a
membership
but
deny
him
all
of
the
rights?
it
would
seem
likely
that
that
would
be
exactly
the
result
of
the
fault.
now,
i
do
not
think
also
that
the
holding
in
gonzales
should
be
limited
only
to
contract
actions.
i
think
that
the
court
in
that
instance
was
talking
of
matters
of
peripheral
concern
in
the
act.
now,
surely,
where
there
is
a
picketing
activity
whether
it's
a
matter
--
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
robert
weldon
smith
whether
it's
a
matter
which
is
directly
within
the
protective
area
of
the
act,
in
that
situation,
where
the
state
may
desire
that
which
is
right
under
the
act
maybe
wrong,
then
the
nlrb
should
have
jurisdiction.
this
is
the
wording
of
the
court
in
the
russell
case.
this
is
what
the
court
has
used
before
in
distinguishing
between
those
cases
which
are
preempted
and
those
cases
which
are
not.
i
thank
the
court.
