mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
texas
courts
have
awarded
actual
and
punitive
damages
to
a
union
member
named
borden.
for
as
the
texas
court
says,
“refusal
to
refer
him
to
a
job
offered
him
in
the
construction
of
the
republic
bank
building
in
dallas”,
we're
here
on
certiorari
challenging
the
texas
state
jurisdiction
and
asserting
that
the
conduct
refusal
to
refer
is
subject
to
the
exclusive
federal
regulation.
we're
quite
close
to
the
case
which
precedes
this,
except
we
don't
have
the
supervisory
problem
in
this
case.
briefly,
the
facts,
borden
was
a
member
of
the
plumber's
union
who
lived
in
shreveport.
construction
workers
are
ambulatory,
he's
all
over
every
place,
building.
he
worked
for
farwell
construction
company
down
in
galveston
and
on
a
big
hospital.
this
job
was
about
to
conclude
and
he
learned
down
there
in
galveston
that
this
large
job
was
coming
in
dallas.
he
quit
in
galveston
and
went
home
to
shreveport
and
as
he
said
went
fishing
for
two
to
three
months.
and
then
in
september,
came
over
to
dallas,
as
he
said
to
go
to
work
on
the
republic
bank
job,
which
was
the
biggest
job
in
dallas
at
that
time.
he
said
that
it
was
a
good
job
and
i
like
to
work
on
big
work.
it
was
a
big
job
and
i
wanted
it.
so
he
went
to
the
supervisor
for
farwell
who
was
the
mechanical
contractor
on
the
republic
bank,
and
was
told
that
he
would
be
employed
if
he
obtained
a
union
referral.
he
then
came
back
to
the
dallas
local
union
hall.
he
had
not
obtained
a
clearance
card
from
his
shreveport
local,
but
he
did
have
his
international
union
due
book
with
him.
he
went
to
the
dallas
local
and
told
the
business
agent,
lanham,
“i'm
here
to
go
to
work
on
the
republic
bank
building.”
as
borden
testified,
lanham
“blow
his
top”
and
said,
“you're
not
going
to
work
on
that
bank
building.
you've
come
in
here
wrong.
you've
come
in
here
with
a
job
in
your
pocket.”
now,
if
i
may
digress
briefly
here,
there
was
a
contract
in
effect
in
dallas
between
this
local
union
and
the
mechanical
contractors
association.
farwell
was
a
member
of
that
association.
it
is
an
abbreviated
contract.
it's
in
the
record.
it
provides
wage
rates
and
grievance
procedures.
it
does
not,
in
so
many
words,
provide
for
a
hiring
hall,
but
it
is
undisputed
in
this
record
that
it
is
the
custom
in
dallas
for
all
the
mechanical
contractors
and
certainly
--
well,
perhaps
i'm
overstating
the
record.
it
is
the
--
it
is
clear
that
farwell
hired
only
through
the
union
hiring
hall
as
a
matter
of
custom.
now,
when
lanham,
the
business
agent,
tells
borden,
the
man
coming
in
from
shreveport,
“you've
come
in
here
wrong;
you've
come
in
with
the
job
in
your
pocket.
i'm
not
going
to
refer
you.”
apparently,
he,
lanham
was
referring
to
a
local
union
rule
which
said
that
members
shall
not
solicit
work
from
any
contractor.
all
the
employment
must
be
procured
through
the
business
office
of
the
local.
this
is
very
much
likely
a
rule
which
was
written
into
the
collective
bargaining
contract
in
the
teamsters
seattle-los
angeles
case
which
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote.
and
it's
not
an
unusual
provision
for
a
building
trade
union
to
require
that
members
seek
their
employment
through
the
hiring
hall
rather
than
directly
from
employer.
in
any
event,
borden
was
unable
to
get
the
referral
to
the
job.
he
returned
to
shreveport,
obtained
a
clearance
card
from
his
shreveport
local
union.
and
then
came
back
to
dallas
and
deposited
his
clearance
card
in
the
dallas
local.
under
the
international
constitution,
that
made
him
a
member
of
the
dallas
local.
his
card
was
not
accepted
very
graciously.
the
business
representative,
lanham
said
that,
“i'll
accept
it.
i
have
to
under
the
constitution,
but
that
don't
mean
you're
going
to
work
by
any
means.”
he
did,
however,
accept
the
clearance
card.
now,
if
i
may
backtrack
for
a
moment.
i
indicated
earlier
that
borden
has
been
working
down
in
galveston
on
a
big
hospital
job
down
there
several
months
earlier.
down
there,
he
became
friendly
with
a
man
named
thurman
who
was
a
rank-and-file
employee.
by
the
time
he
gets
up
to
dallas,
thurman
is
the
foreman
and
the
hiring
agent
for
farwell.
so,
borden
goes
to
his
friend
thurman
who
is
hiring
on
the
republic
bank
job
and
says,
“call
for
me”,
and
thurman
says,
“yes,
i
have
a
job
for
you,
but
you'll
need
a
referral.”
thurman
then
called
lanham,
the
business
agent.
this
is
the
foreman
calling
lanham,
the
business
agent,
and
asked
him
to
refer
borden
now,
and
rather
profanely,
mr.
lanham
said,
“i'm
not
about
to
send
that
old
so
and
so
down
to
the
bank.
he
shoved
his
card
down
our
throat.
i'm
not
about
to
send
him
out
to
the
bank.”
now,
several
days
later,
precise
dates
are
difficult
in
this
record.
it
was
tried
about
six
or
seven
years
after
the
operating
events
and
recollection
on
neither
side
were
too
good,
but
i
won't
dispute
what
my
adversary
says
with
respect
to
four
or
five
days
later.
borden
did
obtain
a
referral
first
of
the
spencer
plumbing
company
job
where
he
worked
until
--
from
september
until
almost
christmas,
until
december
17.
he
was
laid
off
there
when
they
got
cut
off
on
that
job.
early
in
january,
he
was
referred
to
keep
or
a
plumbing
job
and
stayed
there
until
march
or
april
and
was
laid
off
there.
he
was
off
for
only
a
week
or
two
and
which
he
referred
to
the
rose
plumbing
company
and
without
going
into
detail
he
was
referred
then
to
the
texas
plumbing
company
and
to
the
dallas
school
board.
so
for
the
year,
from
the
time
he
first
came
to
dallas,
the
jury
found
that
he
would
have
made
approximately
--
what
is
this?
$6000
as
i
recall,
approximately
$6000
had
he
been
referred
to
the
republic
bank.
but
that
in
the
interim
employment
to
which
he
was
referred,
he
made
some
$1900
less
than
he
would
have
made,
had
he
gone
to
the
job
which
he
preferred.
now,
borden
didn't
ever
attend
a
union
meeting.
he
waited
for
a
year
although
he
was
from
time
to
time
complaining
to
the
business
agent,
but
as
far
as
coming
into
the
local
union
and
making
any
complaint
or
going
before
any
tribunal
before
which
he
might
have
gone,
he
waited
for
a
year
before
he
did
anything
or
perhaps
10
or
11
months
rather
than
a
complete
year,
and
hired
a
lawyer.
well
now,
of
course,
when
he
waited
for
a
year,
he
got
way
past
the
six-month
limitation
period
which
is
in
section
10
(b)
of
the
federal
act.
he
was
foreclosed
under
the
federal
act
because
congress
had
determined
in
the
federal
act
that
these
disputes
ought
to
be
determined
properly
when
recollections
are
fresh
and
when
--
there
can
come
some
remedy
promptly.
he
waited
and
then
hired
him
a
lawyer.
the
lawyer
wrote
the
union.
the
local
union
executive
board
held
a
hearing
and
this
is
11
months
after
--
perhaps,
12
months
after
the
time
he
first
came
to
dallas.
called
borden
and
lanham
and
the
various
people
involved
before
the
local
union
executive
board
and
borden
testified
that
at
that
point,
members
of
the
executive
board
cursed
him
and
abused
him,
and
that
he
suffered
mental
diff
--
or
that
there
was
mental
suffering
by
reason
of
the
abuse
which
was
heaped
on
him
a
year
after
the
event.
now,
on
these
facts,
he
brought
his
suit
alleging
that
he
was
refused
appearance
into
the
local.
now
that
is
a
membership
right
that
he
--
that
the
board
couldn't
do
anything
about.
and
alleging
number
two
that
there
was
a
refusal
of
referral
to
a
job,
and
that
is
something
that
the
board
can
and
does
something
about
everyday.
the
case
went
off
on
the
pleadings
originally.
we
filed
a
plea
to
the
jurisdiction.
there
was
a
finding
in
the
state
district
court
that
it
was
a
matter
of
federal
and
not
state
concern,
and
it
was
dismissed.
borden
appealed
it.
the
dallas
court
of
civil
appeals
affirmed
the
dismissal,
but
while
it
was
pending
on
rehearing,
gonzales
came
down.
and
this
was
properly
called
to
the
texas
court's
opinion
--
attention
and
they
reconsidered
and
held
that
it
was
a
state
matter
and
there
was
state
jurisdiction.
then
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
texas
which
does
not
treat
of
the
federal
preemption
issue
at
all.
it
treats
of
other
matters
in
the
case.
and
in
a
lengthy
opinion,
the
texas
supreme
court
came
to
the
nub
of
what
the
case
was
about
under
texas
law,
that
it
said
that
the
allegations
that
borden
willfully
was
denied
a
job
to
which
he
was
entitled
under
the
rules
and
procedures
established
by
the
union
for
allocating
work
entitled
him
to
maintain
this
suit,
and
remanded
for
a
jury
trial.
now,
we
have
a
special
issue
practice
in
texas.
no
general
verdict.
the
jury
answered
specific
questions
as
to
what
had
happened.
the
jury
found
that
he
had
been
promised
of
a
job
on
the
bank
if
he
got
a
referral.
that
the
foreman
called
for
him
--
called
the
union
to
give
him
a
referral
and
the
union
wouldn't
do
it.
the
jury
found
that
he
was
not
refused
clearance
into
the
union.
and
in
our
view,
that
takes
this
membership
right,
individual
versus
union,
out
of
the
case
by
this
favorable
finding
to
us
on
that
aspect
of
the
case,
but
did
found
that
he
was
refused
a
referral
and
that
he
had
been
damaged
in
the
amount
of
approximately
$1900.
now,
what
was
the
damage
that
they
found?
what
was
the
measure?
he
--
the
damage
he
would
have
earned
if
he
had
been
allowed
to
work
on
the
republic
bank,
exactly
the
same
back
pay
that
the
board
could
have
given
under
the
federal
act.
now,
counsel
through
his
briefs
has
indicated
that
there's
malice
and
there's
some
kind
of
general
tort
idea
and
there
are
other
wrongs
involved,
but
we
take
that
he's
bound
by
what
he
presented
to
the
jury
and
what
the
jury
found.
and
the
only
damage
they
found
was
the
damage
that
is
squarely
within
the
federal
remedy
and
the
very
matter
that
the
board
would
look
to.
in
addition,
the
jury
found
$1500
worth
of
mental
anguish
and
$5000
worth
of
punitive
damages.
so
we,
under
the
verdict,
had
$1900
of
actual
damage
for
the
difference
between
what
he
has
made
at
republic
and
elsewhere,
$1500
for
mental
anguish,
and
$5000
for
punitive.
there
were
post
trial
motions
and
the
trial
court
found
that
mental
anguish
was
not
raised
by
the
law
in
the
evidence
and
should
not
have
been
submitted.
we
take
it
that
this
is
a
trial
court
finding
that
much
of
what
is
in
our
opponent's
brief
about
ugly
talk
by
the
executive
board
or
ugly
talk
by
a
union
business
agent
is
clearly
out
of
the
case
because
the
trial
court
found
in
his
judgment
that
it
was
not
raised
for
the
evidence
and
should
not
have
been
submitted
as
an
issue.
so,
the
trial
court
then
reduced
the
punitive
damage
to
the
equal
of
the
actual
damage
and
entered
a
judgment
against
us
for
double
what
the
labor
board
would
have
given,
had
the
matter
been
before
the
board.
i
emphasize
there
was
no
damage
for
the
cursing,
no
damages
for
refusal
to
clear
in
to
the
union,
and
the
sole
damage
was
with
respect
to
the
refusal
to
refer
to
this
job.
now,
on
the
basis
of
that
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
$1900
and
something,
doubled
to
$3800
and
a
little
more.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
just
on
the
theory
that
texas
gives
punitive
damages.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
your
honor,
i
said
mental
suffering.
that
he
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
he
had
three
crutches
on
which
he
was
moving,
actual
mental
suffering
and
punitive
damages.
the
jury
gave
him
all
three.
the
court
not
dealt
with
mental
suffering
and
reduced
the
punitive
to
be
equal
to
the
actual
damage.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
judge,
we
always
thought
so.
this
court
didn't
charge
the
necessity
of
finding
malice.
and
nevertheless,
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
charged
the
jury
merely
that
--
what
do
you
think
is
--
what
is
the
proper
punitive
award
here
without
defining
it
in
terms
of
malice.
we
objected
to
that
but
our
objection
got
us
nowhere
on
the
--
in
the
appellate
courts
and
the
texas
court
doesn't
write
at
any
length
on
this
technical
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
i
don't
believe
youcan,
judge.
there's
certainly
no
finding
here
if
--
of
any
malice.
the
specific
finding,
i
wonder
if
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
well,
i
would
certainly
take
the
view
that
that
is
immaterial,
that
texas
has
no
business
supplementing
the
board's
remedy,
and
in
that
connection
the
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
the
jury
did
but
judge
stout
would
doubt
much
as
he
--
had
he
cut
it
down
to
the
$1900
which
were
--
was
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
we
asked
the
judge
to
give
us
--
to
inquire
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
malice
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
judge,
i
don't
believe
we
printed
that.
i
think
if
you
look
at
page
66,
you'll
find
the
special
issue
number
14.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
as
i
read
the
plaintiff's
pleadings
and
as
the
texas
court
read
the
plaintiff's
pleadings,
it
was
in
tort
of
the
type
that
your
honor
has
indicated.
it
was
in
contract,
claiming
a
contract
right
to
referral
as
set
out
in
the
--
in
the
union
constitution
and
in
the
union
rules.
there
was
also
a
reference
in
the
petition
to
the
texas
right
to
work
law.
however,
the
appellate
court
made
no
reference
at
all
to
the
latter
matter
and
decided
it
purely
as
a
matter
of
texas
tort
and
contract
law.
if
i
might
very
briefly
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
my
understanding
has
been
that
it
means
more
than
willful
acts
--
willful-wrongful
act.
there
has
to
be
some
--
something
more
than
that
in
texas
although
that
was
the
proposition
that
we
--
prevented
judge
stout
and
which
was
denied
us
here
but
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
see
how
this
can
really
have
any
relevance
to
the
case
here
of
what
the
texas
law
is
if
the
federal
government
has
occupied
the
field.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
well
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
this
i
gather
was
the
trial
court's
view
in
the
--
in
the
instruction
which
he
gave
on
page
62
of
the
record.
the
appellate
court
doesn't
talk
about
that
but
--
yes,
sir.
by
the
term
willfully
as
used
in
this
charge
is
meant
the
intention
--
intentional
and
purposeful
disregard
of
the
known
rights
of
another.
and
then
over
on
this
inquiry
with
respect
to
the
--
with
respect
to
the
punitive
damage,
he
merely
says,
“you're
instructed
that
--
this
is
on
page
66,
that
by
the
term
punitive
damage
is
meant
damages
which
are
assessed
against
the
defendant
for
the
purpose
of
punishing
it
and
also
for
the
purpose
of
setting
a
wholesome
example
if
any
to
others.”
now,
we
say
that
it's
not
of
texas
business
to
be
setting
wholesome
examples
for
other
or
punishing
unions
with
respect
to
matters
as
to
which
the
federal
law
has
fully
occupied
the
field.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
exactly
so,
and
as
the
texas
appellate
court
makes
crystal
clear
right
on
the
face
of
its
opinion,
that
is
exactly
what
texas
has
done
here.
now,
we
say
that
the
matter
of
a
referral
system
is
a
matter
that
is
literally
hundreds
of
times
before
the
labor
board.
some
2000
--
8
(b)
(2)
cases
before
it
in
a
year,
charges
filed
in
over
a
hundred
formal
board
orders
in
areas
like
this.
we
have
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
yes,
sir,
that
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
i
do
that
depending
on
what
the
labor
board
had
found.
now,
if
the
--
if
the
labor
board
found
that
the
reason
for
the
refusal
of
referral
was
a
reason,
why
did
toward
discrimination
to
affect
union
membership,
then
there
would
have
been
a
remedy.
we
say
that
the
labor
board
may
well
have
found
because
i've
recited
borden's
testimony
here
but
they're
sharply
conflicting.
we
say
that
had
--
well,
the
--
another
tribunal
heard
it.
they
may
well
have
found
that
borden
was
properly
refused
a
referral
quite
similarly
to
the
plaintiff
in
the
california
case,
the
teamsters
case
that
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
for
running
around
the
hiring
hall
and
getting
his
job
outside
the
hiring
hall.
but
we
say
that
you
can't
tell
whether
it
would
be
lawful
or
unlawful
under
the
federal
act
until
you
find
out
what
the
reason
was.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
exactly,
so.
yes,
sir.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
8
(b)
(1)
and
8
(b)
(2),
it's
the
radio
officers'
case.
it's
just
exactly
like
fowler
in
the
radio
officers'
case
here.
fowler
went
to
work
contrary
to
his
union
rule,
didn't
clear
through
the
union
hall
and
the
union
found
out
about
it
and
asked
the
employer
to
fire
him.
and
this
court
found
that
that
was
violative
of
fowler's
rights
under
the
union
contract,
but
the
point
on
which
the
court
centered
was
not
the
matter
of
contract
violation,
but
the
fact
that
the
federal
congress
has
legislated
about
activities
like
hire
--
about
hiring
halls.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
well
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
at
that
time
it
was
--
well,
that
fowler
--
the
radio
officers'
case
was
against
the
union,
and
as
i
recall
against
the
union
alone.
in
that
connection
there's
some
very
--
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
8
(b)
(1)
and
(2).
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
yes,
sir.
in
that
connection,
there
are
two
very
recent
nlrb
cases
which
are
not
yet
formally
printed.
they're
only
in
their
mimeograph
form.
we
have
printed
them
as
an
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
here,
the
philadelphia
hotel
case
and
marine
engineers'
case
in
alabama,
both
of
which
are
just
on
all
fours
on
these
facts.
what
i'm
saying
is
if
the
labor
board
found
the
facts
as
the
texas
jury
found
them,
then
we
are
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
if,
however,
the
labor
board
found
the
facts
says
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
a
legitimate
hiring
hall
relationship
insofar
as
borden
is
concerned,
we
might
have
had
the
same
result
that
the
union
had
in
the
los
angeles-seattle
case.
you
can't
tell
until
you
get
the
federal
determination.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
yes,
sir.
if
your
honor
please,
i
should
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
l.
n.
d.
wells,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
unless
there
are
questions
of
the
court,
i'll
waive
rebuttal.
thank
you,
your
honors.
