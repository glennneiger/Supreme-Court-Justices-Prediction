mr.
frank
salter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
reference
to
the
question
of
appointment
of
counsel
in
this
particular
matter,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
as
of
the
time
of
the
arraignment,
prior
to
the
appointment
of
able
counsel,
the
defendant
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty
to
the
crime
of
murder
which
is
the
only
crime
for
which
he
has
been
tried
and
convicted.
this
crime
of
robbery,
armed
robbery
which
he
had
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to,
in
which
plea
the
court
permitted
to
be
withdrawn
along
with
all
other
pleas
has
never
been
to
trial
your
honor,
only
the
charge
of
the
murder.
mr.
frank
salter
yes.
now,
on
this
question
of
appointment
of
counsel,
as
both
counsel
agree,
the
arraignment
was
set
aside
on
--
as
it
is
permitted
to
be
done
under
louisiana
law.
and
the
defendant
was
arraigned
again
with
the
assistance
of
counsel.
we
take
the
position
that
this
case
differs
from
hamilton,
david
hamilton
versus
alabama.
and
that
under
alabama
law,
an
arraignment
cannot
be
set
aside
once
a
man
has
been
arraigned,
there
are
certain
rights
that
are
irretrievably
lost.
that
is
not
the
situation
under
louisiana
law.
mr.
frank
salter
no
sir,
none
whatsoever.
and
then
this
particular
--
that
is
the
law
of
louisiana
and
in
this
particular
case,
he
was
permitted
to
withdraw
those
pleas.
in
other
words,
that
arraignment
was
set
aside
as
if
that
it
never
occurred.
now,
your
honor,
the
question
is
on
that
particular
point
itself,
are
we
to
be
permitted
to
correct
if
it
is
a
mistake,
a
mistake
as
we
did
in
this
case
at
that
time
with
reference
to
the
arraignment
and
counsel
are
--
does
the
law
deny
us
the
right
to
correct
it
at
the
time
we
did
and
require
us
to
go
on
through
trial
through
all
of
the
appellate
procedures
within
our
state
and
through
the
supreme
court
and
then
go
back
and
correct
it
on
that
particular
point.
they
have
had
this
defendant
as
able
counsel.
now,
with
reference
to
their
question
number
three
with
the
court's
indulgence,
i
am
skipping
around
on
their
question.
mr.
frank
salter
i'll
discuss
their
question
number
two
first.
mr.
frank
salter
with
reference
to
their
question
as
to
the
oral
and
written
confessions,
this
crime
was
committed
at
approximately
7
p.m.
within
an
hour
or
two,
the
defendant
was
arrested
driving
one
of
the
victim's
automobile
down
the
highway
with
the
suitcase
full
of
the
$14,091
that
he'd
gotten
from
the
bank
when
he
robbed
it
and
kidnapped
them
at
gunpoint
and
took
them
out
and
lined
them
up,
started
shooting
at
them.
the
oral
confession
at
which
defense
counsel
alleged
with
certain
statements
made
by
this
defendant
on
the
ride
back
from
highway
louisiana
close
to
the
point
of
capture
to
lake
charles,
some
distance
of
ten
miles.
those
oral
confessions,
your
honor,
the
record
will
reflect
were
in
the
nature
of
spontaneous
confessions.
they
were
not
the
result
of
an
interrogation.
they
were
not
a
question
and
answer
confession.
while
riding
back
with
the
sheriff
and
another
deputy,
he
makes
certain
admissions
of
a
spontaneous
nature.
mr.
frank
salter
sir,
this
was
within
two
hours
after
the
offense
was
committed.
now,
the
television
didn't
take
place
until
the
next
day.
he
was
captured
in
riding
back,
these
oral
confessions.
upon
the
return
to
lake
charles
that
night,
he
was
taken
into
the
sheriff's
office
where
he
again
and
in
more
detail,
orally
confessed
and
that
confession
was
reduced
to
writing
and
signed
by
him.
now,
the
people
present
during
that
confession
were
myself,
two
fbi
agents,
the
sheriff,
two
or
three
deputies,
the
defendant,
all
in
a
rather
large
room.
that
was
a
narrative
type
confession,
your
honor.
as
matter
of
fact,
the
record
reflects
that
one
question
was
asked
that
defendant
at
the
time
this
confession
was
taken.
he's
been
brought
into
the
jail
from
the
car
after
being
transported
in
from
the
point
of
capture.
he
sat
down
on
a
chair
and
he
was
given
a
cigarette
and
the
record's
going
to
reflect
now
the
question
that
was
asked,
“wilbert,
do
you
want
to
tell
us
about
it?”
that's
the
interrogation.
mr.
frank
salter
your
honor,
he
was
not
at
that
point
advised
of
any
right
to
counsel.
he
made
no
request
for
counsel.
his
mother
was
sitting
out
in
the
waiting
room
with
his
brother.
as
to
whether
there'd
been
any
conversation
between
them,
i
do
not
know
but
she
knew
he
was
there.
of
course,
now
this
case
on
the
question
of
confession
and
counsel
can
be
distinguished
and
it's
distinguishable
from
spano
versus
new
york
in
this
regard.
mr.
frank
salter
he
was
advised,
that's
set
forth
in
page
7
of
the
brief,
your
honor,
that
he
didn't
have
to
say
anything
that
anything
he
said
could
be
held
against
him
--
mr.
frank
salter
--
and
could
be
used
against
him
in
trial.
mr.
frank
salter
was
not
discussed
in
any
regard.
as
i
say
your
honor,
this
--
these
two
confessions,
the
oral
on
the
road
back
from
capture
to
the
jail
and
the
oral
at
the
jail
that
resulted
in
being
reduced
to
writing
of
a
spontaneous
nature
in
a
narrative
type
confession
not
the
result
of
interrogation.
and
this
--
this
is
further
distinguished
from
the
spano
case
with
regard
to
counsel
in
this
respect.
in
spano
versus
new
york,
the
defendant
had
already
been
indicted
as
the
court
said
the
crime
had
already
been
solved.
the
defendant
had
already
been
indicted.
he
had
been
there
with
his
lawyer
and
his
lawyer
said,
“don't
talk.”
and
then
they
interrogated
him
in
shifts
for
eight
hours.
in
addition
to
that,
he
used
a
supposed
friend
on
the
police
department
lulled
him
into
(inaudible)
security.
whereas
here,
there'd
been
no
indictment,
the
confessions
were
in
a
nature
of
spontaneous
narrative
type
confessions
taken
in
the
course
of
the
search
for
the
person
who
had
committed
the
crime
before
any
indictment.
mr.
frank
salter
what
paragraph,
if
you
mind
--
mr.
frank
salter
your
honor,
it
is
not
my
position
that
he
was
advised
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
frank
salter
he
was
advised
as
of
the
time
that
i
was
present
with
reference
to
the
statement
but
not
of
--
not
with
reference
to
counsel
--
mr.
frank
salter
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
salter
well,
your
honor,
it's
--
mr.
frank
salter
let
me
see.
mr.
frank
salter
that
is
the
area
in
which
it's
covered,
your
honor,
the
--
page
transcript
citation
given
by
the
petitioner
in
this
court.
now,
--
mr.
frank
salter
with
reference
to
the
spontaneous
oral
confession
made
coming
back
to
the
jail,
i
have
--
i
cannot
state
one
way
or
another
whether
he's
advised
--
mr.
frank
salter
--
your
honor.
the
record
will
not
show
that
whether
he
was
advised
of
anything
at
that
time.
mr.
frank
salter
in
the
office
--
i
take
the
position
that
he
was
advised
not
of
a
right
to
counsel.
mr.
frank
salter
but
that
what
he
said
could
be
used
against
him.
mr.
frank
salter
as
i
remember
the
record,
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
frank
salter
with
reference
--
with
reference
--
mr.
frank
salter
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
salter
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
salter
yes
sir,
along
with
this
television
soundtrack
with
a
statement
that
proceeded.
your
honor,
with
reference
to
the
television,
of
course
they
--
it
bears
upon
this
case
from
the
standpoint
of
whether
or
not
a
fair
and
impartial
juror
and
jury
and
trial
could
be
had.
but
for
that
question,
it
would
be
of
no
moment
to
this
court
but
it's
--
because
it's
only
in
that
way
that
it
brings
into
play
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
or
not
he
was
able
to
obtain
a
fair
jury
and
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
now,
after
this
television
film
had
been
taken
on
the
day
following
the
two
confessions
and
had
been
shown
on
three
different
occasions,
defense
counsel
moved
for
a
change
of
venue
alleging
that
the
bias
and
prejudice
caused
by
this
television
would
prevent
obtaining
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
which
could
give
the
defendant
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
the
state
takes
the
position
that
this
defendant
could
and
did
get
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
by
a
fair
and
impartial
jury.
on
the
question
of
motion
for
change
of
venue,
29
witnesses
appeared
and
testified.
their
testimony
is
in
the
record
which
is
in
this
court.
24
of
those
29
witnesses
were
of
the
opinion
that
he
could
obtain
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
mr.
frank
salter
i
would
estimate
approximately
150,000
people.
now,
your
honor
with
reference
to
figures
though,
this
television
station
serves
more
than
that
parish
or
county.
it
serves
a
much
wider
area.
mr.
frank
salter
no,
sir.
now
--
mr.
frank
salter
there
were
29
witnesses
called.
mr.
frank
salter
no
sir.
29
witnesses
called
to
--
on
the
--
to
establish
in
evidence
on
the
motion
for
a
change
of
venue.
a
hearing
was
held
on
that.
mr.
frank
salter
that
he
could
obtain
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
now,
that
is
shown
in
the
record.
all
of
their
testimony
is
in
the
record.
and
--
mr.
frank
salter
whatever
witnesses
the
state
desired
to
call
or
whatever
witnesses
the
defense
counsel
desired
to
call.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
defense
counsel
hired
a
private
investigator
to
go
out
among
the
public
to
ask
certain
questions
to
determine
whether
in
their
opinion
he
could
get
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
as
a
result
of
their
investigator's
efforts,
they
called
some
of
those
people
they
talked
to.
mr.
frank
salter
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
salter
it
was
--
it
was
what
they
felt
like
they
could
do
and
what
they
felt
in
their
opinion
of
the
citizens
in
the
community
could
do.
mr.
frank
salter
well,
no
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
called
some
of
the
defense
witnesses
myself
but
they
neglected
the
call.
mr.
frank
salter
that
they
did
not
call
--
that
they're
subpoenaed
but
did
not
call.
mr.
frank
salter
i
don't
remember
the
exact
number,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
salter
there
were
29
who
testified
at
the
hearing.
i
do
not
recall
how
many
of
them
were
state
witnesses
and
how
many
were
defense
witness.
but
the
total
figure
that
testified
at
the
hearing
on
a
motion
for
change
of
venue
was
29,
five
of
them
said
he
could
not
get
a
fair
trial,
24
of
whom
said
that
he
could.
now,
i
do
remember
then
the
record
will
reflect
that
defense
counsel's
investigator,
i
put
him
on
the
stand
and
he
testified
that
he
talked
to
no
less
than
31
people.
but
yet,
i
believe
the
record
will
reflect,
well,
five
of
them
testified
he
couldn't
get
a
fair
trial
and
he
--
in
his
--
in
the
record,
it
shows
their
investigator
talked
to
31
people
which
indicates
--
mr.
frank
salter
well
--
mr.
frank
salter
your
honor,
that's
a
matter
of
conjuncture.
mr.
frank
salter
well,
let
me
say
this
--
mr.
frank
salter
alright
sir.
mr.
frank
salter
who
believed
that
he
could.
now,
of
course,
i
would
presume
and
believe
that
the
proof
of
the
footing
is
in
the
aiding.
when
it
came
time
for
trial,
the
record
will
reflect
that
approximately
what
120
to
130,
i
believe,
prospective
jurors
were
examined
on
voir
dire,
your
honor.
that's
the
--
oh,
that's
the
maximum
number
required
to
obtain
a
jury.
this
case
is
quite
different
from
--
i
believe
it
was
irving
--
irvin
versus
dowd,
the
case
set
your
honor
well.
in
that
case,
from
the
first
place,
the
newspapers
and
other
media
printed
the
defendant's
prior
record.
nothing
like
that
was
done
here.
they
had
cartoons
of
electric
chairs
and
things
of
that
nature.
editorial
opinion
and
comment
in
that
case
whereas
in
the
rideau
case,
nothing
but
straight
news
reporting.
in
that
case,
mob
violence,
the
burning
of
homes,
the
court
having
to
enforce
and
put
into
effect
strict
rules
of
procedure
in
order
to
preserve
the
safety
of
the
people
in
that
community,
nothing
like
that
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
salter
trial
began
on
april
the
10th.
i
believe
the
last
showing
of
this
was
probably
on
or
about
the
20th.
mr.
frank
salter
of
february.
mr.
frank
salter
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
salter
yes
sir,
almost
two
months.
mr.
frank
salter
12.
mr.
frank
salter
yes.
mr.
frank
salter
each
side
gets
same
amount,
12
for
the
jury
and
then
one
for
the
alternative.
mr.
frank
salter
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
salter
i
do
not
have
the
figure
available,
your
honor,
but
there
was
something
like
a
120
to
a
150
jurors,
prospective
jurors,
examined
on
voir
dire
before
obtaining
the
whole
panel.
mr.
frank
salter
yes
sir,
so
--
say,
with
30
--
well,
let's
i
say
a
150,
although
there
had
to
be
a
good
number
of
those
who
were
challenged
because
on
the
basis
of
conscientious
scruples
against
capital
punishment
--
mr.
frank
salter
--
and
many
other
things.
mr.
frank
salter
the
only
record
of
the
voir
dire
is
in
connection
with
those
particular
challenges
where
the
court
overruled
the
defendant's
motion
for
challenge
and
they
reserved
the
bill
of
exception.
mr.
frank
salter
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
salter
yes
sir.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
cover
very
quickly
this
two
deputy
sheriffs.
in
many,
many
communities,
if
not
all,
some
good
citizen
who
want
some
form
of
identification,
so
maybe
he'll
get
a
little
friendly
treatment
from
the
police
officer
driving
down
the
highway
will
go
into
the
sheriff's
office
and
say,
“sheriff,
i'd
like
to
have
a
commission.
and
so
if
he
is
a
person
that
the
sheriff
feels
is
of
good
character
and
he
can
--
that
sort
of
thing.
he
will
say,
“here
is
your
commission,
it's
an
honorary
commission.
no
pay,
no
duty,
no
nothing.”
honorary.
mr.
frank
salter
yes,
sir.
and
those
of
a
two
tight
men
that
defense
counsel
is
talking
about
100%.
are
we
to
assume
--
mr.
frank
salter
--
that
people
like
that
can't
be
fair
and
impartial?
mr.
frank
salter
no,
sir.
these
two
men
are
strictly
honorary
as
justice
says,
like
the
kentucky
colonel.
mr.
frank
salter
well,
your
honor,
under
our
law
anyone
can
carry
arms
--
mr.
frank
salter
--
so
long
as
they're
not
concealed
on
their
person.
mr.
frank
salter
well,
no,
not
concealed.
mr.
frank
salter
oh,
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
salter
well
--
mr.
frank
salter
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there
that
we
would
have
to
assume
something
outside
of
the
record
and
assume
something
very
sinister
outside
of
the
record.
mr.
frank
salter
well,
that
will
be
my
error
from
straying
from
the
facts
of
this
case.
i'm
sure
that
the
record
though
in
this
case
will
reflect
that
these
