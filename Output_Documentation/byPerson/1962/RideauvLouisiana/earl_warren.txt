chief
justice
earl
warren
where
did
this
television
take
place?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
could
it
possibly
have
been
done
without
the
confinements
of
the
sheriff?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
had
it
permitted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
in
his
office.
chief
justice
earl
warren
participated
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
they
challenged?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
did
use
all
your
peremptory
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
salter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it's
been
before
the

chief
justice
earl
warren
no,

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
your
own
language,
mr.
salter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
you
present
at
the
television
appearance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
jurors,
you
mean?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
the
24
witnesses
called
by
the
--
called
by
the
state
and
the
five
witnesses
called
by
the
defense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
were
the
24
though
who
testified
that
he
could
get
a
fair
trial
were
those
--
the
ones
located
and
subpoenaed
by
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
thought
you
said
there
were
24
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
though
it
wouldn't
be
a
very
popular
thing
in
that
community
after
that
television
appearance
for
a
citizen
to
take
the
stand
and
testify
in
his
behalf
that
he
couldn't
get
a
fair
trial
in
that
county.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it's
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
only
say
it
because
you've
tell
us
there
were
24
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
who
had
said
that
he
could
get
a
fair
trial
and
five
has
said
that
he
couldn't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
aren't
they
permitted
to
carry
arms
by
reason
of
being
a
deputy
sheriff,
isn't
that
why
most
of
them
get
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
concealed
arms?
chief
justice
earl
warren
concealed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
can't
--
can
a
deputy
sheriff,
special
deputy
sheriff
do
that
in
your
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
does
have
some
connection
and
you
say
that
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
is
a
deputy
sheriff
because
he
likes
to
get
some
favors
from
the
police.
like
he
is
speeding
or
something
and
gets
a
favor
from
them.
i
suppose,
if
you
testified
against
him,
why
those
favors
wouldn't
be
forthcoming,
would
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
maybe
it's
a
little
sinister
to
say
he
is
entitled
to
some
consideration
for
driving
down
the
road
against
the
law,
might
be
some
sinister
in
that
too.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
case
officers
under
your
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
there
are
no
questions,
we'll
adjourn.
