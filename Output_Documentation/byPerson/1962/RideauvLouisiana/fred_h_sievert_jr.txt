mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
on
february
17,
1961,
you
are
in
the
city
of
lake
charles
or
the
surrounding
areas,
in
the
late
afternoon
and
you
had
your
tv
set
on,
you
saw
something
which
probably
you
had
never
seen
before
and
probably
may
never
see
again.
we
saw
a
19-year
old
colored
boy
in
the
custody
of
the
sheriff
of
calcasieu
parish
confessing
by
sound
and
by
this
picture
to
the
commission
of
three
heinous
crimes:
murder,
aggravated
kidnapping
and
armed
robbery.
that
young
colored
boy
is
the
petitioner
before
your
honors.
the
day
before
in
lake
charles
in
the
late
evening,
a
bank
was
robbed,
three
tellers
kidnapped
and
taken
out
of
town,
shot,
and
one
of
them
murdered
with
a
knife.
the
petitioner
was
picked
up
two
or
three
hours
later,
he
then
thereafter
made
oral
admissions,
a
written
confession
and
the
following
morning,
in
the
sheriff's
office,
this
boy
who
had
up
to
that
time
had
been
without
counsel,
without
friends,
without
anyone
to
lean
on,
was
made
the
participant
as
well
as
the
record
shows
without
his
knowledge
of
what
was
happening
in
this
movie,
at
which
time
a
sound
track
was
made
by
the
local
and
only
television
station
in
lake
charles.
and
that
film
which
lasted
for
20
minutes
wherein
this
petitioner
confessed
to
the
commission
of
these
crimes
which
shown
on
the
17th
to
approximately
24,000
people,
was
shown
on
february
18,
the
following
day
to
approximately
53,000
people
and
was
shown
on
february
the
19th
to
approximately
29,000
people.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
the
record
doesn't
show
specifically.
we
think,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
result,
the
prejudice
that
resulted
is
the
same.
we
have
no
proof
--
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
your
honor,
i
have
no
proof
to
the
matter.
i
think
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
very
hot
news
item.
i
think
everybody
became
overexuberant
perhaps
about
the
quick
capture
and
that
sort
of
thing.
but
i
think
that
the
phrases
that
resulted
was
nevertheless
(inaudible).
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
it
doesn't
show
either
way.
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
he
was
sitting
--
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
well,
as
far
as
i
remember,
the
film,
it
is
in
evidence,
i
think
the
film
which
show
the
equipment
by
whether
or
not
this
boy
who
i
think
was
an
8th
grade
and
knew
what
sound
equipment
was
and
whether
this
was
merely
part
of
police
routine
which
he
was
not
familiar
with
or
not,
of
course
i
don't
know.
the
record
doesn't
show,
if
the
court
please,
that
he
voluntarily
submitted
to
this
or
that
he
knew
what
was
happening
or
that
he
gave
them
authority
or
okay,
they're
convicting
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
public
before
he
was
even
arraigned.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it
doesn't.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
it
was
in
the
sheriff's
office,
mr.
chief
justice.
at
the
time,
the
sheriff
was
shown
on
the
film.
he
also
interviewed
a
state
troop
who
apprehended
this
petitioner
the
night
before.
it
lasted
for
approximately
20
minutes.
the
sheriff
would
do
most
of
the
talking.
he'd
say
one
out,
“wilbert,
didn't
you
--
then
you
threw
the
knife
here?”
and
the
petitioner
would
say,
“yes”
and
shake
his
head
and
he
said,
“well
now,
you
don't
know
why
you
did
these
crimes?”
and
then
the
petitioner
would
say
--
shake
his
head
and
say,
“yes.”
so
--
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
sheriff's
office
of
calcasieu
parish
and
that
is
the
parish
seat,
lake
charles'
parish
seat
in
our
area.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
oh,
the
sheriff
had
to
know
about
it?
if
the
court
--
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
he
had
it
--
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
he
participated
in
it.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
now,
i
think
in
answering
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
where
the
--
as
i
appreciated
his
question
was
this
designed
with
the
purpose
of
prejudicing
this
boy,
i
can't
say
that.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
but
obviously
the
sheriff
knew
about
it
because
he
must
have
arranged
it.
he
permitted
it
in
his
premises
where
no
one
could
have
gone
without
his
permission.
and
of
course,
all
during
this
time,
this
boy
had
no
counsel.
the
record
doesn't
show
that
any
time
he
had
anyone
to
lean
on
which
is
another
point
that
we
have
raised.
and
again
all
of
these,
before
arraignment,
before
indictment
in
fact,
this
took
place
february
the
16th,
to
go
on
further,
the
boy
was
arraigned
on
march
1,
1961.
that
time,
not
only
had
they
had
all
admissions,
a
confession
in
writing,
the
following
day
the
tv
film,
then
the
fbi
took
the
confession.
two
weeks
later,
he
was
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
and
arraigned
--
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
and
we
specifically
raised
that.
he
was
arraigned
on
three
counts
and
one
indictment
murder,
aggravated
kidnapping
to
which
he
plead
not
guilty.
to
the
third
count,
which
was
armed
robbery
with
which
was
a
felony
murder
in
the
context
of
all
of
these
facts,
he
plead
guilty.
the
only
thing
left
--
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
this
was
at
the
arraignment
as
yet
he
did
not
have
counsel.
mr.
leithead
and
myself
were
not
appointed
until
after
this
boy
had
plead
guilty.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
they
asked
him,
what
we
are
you
--
what
were
pleas,
we
were
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
that's
the
practice.
to
call
the
--
they
accused
before
the
boy
asked
him
how
he
--
the
indictment
is
read,
how
does
he
plead.
and
of
course,
he
plead
not
guilty
to
the
first
two
and
then
guilty
to
the
third.
why?
that
was
permitted
since
what
was
involved
was
a
felony
murder,
of
course
we
don't
know
and
we
have
raised
it.
so
--
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
the
trial
began
on
april
the
10th,
it
was
completed
on
april
the
17th.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
yes
sir.
oh,
was
less
than
59
days
as
i
calculated.
we
had
a
boy
charged,
indicted,
and
sentenced
to
death.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
that
motion
was
denied
and
we
of
course
reserved
our
--
it
was
argued
in
our
court
and
it
was
one
of
the
bases
of
our
coming
at
this
court
for
a
writ.
in
addition
to
the
fact,
and
we
have
also
raised
that
this
boy
being
allowed
to
plead
guilty
without
counsel.
we
also
raised
the
question
of
these
purported
confessions
which
went
into
evidence.
now,
if
the
court
please,
this
record
may
not
be
as
complete.
on
this
matter,
we
raised
that
and
quite
candidly
it
was
not
one
of
the
four
points
raised
in
our
application.
we
asked
the
court
though
to
consider
it
under
rule
23
since
we
think
it
encompasses
something
properly
under
the
--
or
one
of
the
four
points
that
we
did
raise,
in
which
the
writ
was
granted.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
no
sir,
the
question
of
our
not
having
a
complete
record.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
now,
in
fairness
to
the
state,
we
got
us
a
complete
record
as
was
permitted.
mr.
leithead
and
i
without
any
apology
were
civil
lawyers.
we
don't
normally
practice
law.
we
were
appointed
by
the
trial
court
in
lake
charles
to
defend
the
petitioner.
so,
consequently,
as
your
honors
know,
in
a
civil
practice,
a
record
is
being
made
and
you
rely
on
your
record.
in
this
case,
as
in
criminal
cases
in
louisiana,
if
you're
questioning
a
witness
on
his
voir
dire
examination
and
then
you
challenge
him
at
the
end
and
the
judge
says,
“well,
i
won't
grant
the
challenge.”
you
accept,
you
reserve
your
--
through
his
ruling,
you
reserve
a
bill,
then
everything
stops.
and
then
the
attorney
for
the
accused
and
the
district
attorney
attempt
to
reconstruct
what
was
said.
so
that
if
perhaps
this
record
is
not
as
complete
as
it
should
be,
that
is
the
reason
and
we
did
argue
and
raise
that
point
in
the
lower
court.
now
--
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
yes
sir,
your
honor.
it's
about
700
pages,
but
actually
it's
a
lot
of
exhibits
and
pleadings
and
the
like.
there's
--
there
is
several
hundred
pages
of
testimony
which
was
taken
when
we
argued
our
motions
for
change
of
venue
and
a
sanity
hearing
and
the
like.
now,
one
point
which
i
think
will
be
raised
by
the
state
on
this
matter
of
not
having
counsel
at
the
time
of
arraignment
under
our
law,
the
judge
may
permit
an
accused
to
withdraw
pleas
for
the
purposes
of
filing
motions.
that
was
done
in
this
case,
but
we
would
say
to
your
honors
even
though
we
were
aware
of
the
hamilton
case
and
the
case
that
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
read
a
procurement
opinion
in
today,
i
think
it
was
on
docket
number
600.
nevertheless,
even
if
we
must
for
some
reason
in
this
case
point
to
prejudice,
we
think
this,
the
boy's
plea
of
guilty
to
the
armed
robbery
which
was
a
series,
one
series
of
transactions,
one
crime
was
aired
in
the
newspaper
so
that
consequently
he
was
at
a
critical
time
without
the
benefit
of
counsel.
so
later
when
we
withdrew
those
pleas
and
we
said
we
now
enter
pleas
of
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
such
pleas
became
mere
lawyer's
pleas.
and
--
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
yes.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
yes
sir.
if
we
must
point
to
something,
we
point
to
that.
now,
if
the
court
please,
on
our
change
of
venue
when
that
was
overruled
and
we
went
to
trial,
it
took
a
number
of
days
to
select
a
jury.
this
petitioner
was
required,
if
the
court
please,
to
submit
his
life
to
a
jury
of
12
persons,
three
of
whom
had
seen
this
entire
tv
film
who
have
heard
the
defendant
confess,
who
had
seen
the
petitioner's
face
as
this
man
confessed.
now,
if
the
court
please,
if
you're
starting
off
with
three
people
against
you
and
i
don't
challenge
the
sincerity
of
those
jurors
who
sat
on
the
case,
but
we
think,
if
the
court
please,
that
it's
not
within
our
human
understanding
and
everyday
experience
for
a
district
judge
to
say
to
those
three
people,
“now,
can
you
remove
from
your
mind
this
20-minute
film
that
you
saw
this
boy
confessing.”
we
don't
think
that
that
conforms
with
reasons,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
we
--
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
no,
if
the
court
please,
he
didn't.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
we
challenged
them
for
a
cause
--
we
challenged
them
for
cause,
we
then
challenged
them
peremptorily,
the
court
informed
us
that
our
peremptory
challenge
has
had
been
exhausted
and
we
had.
so
that
gentlemen
is
basically
our
case.
i
don't
know
what
else
i
can
say.
i
couldn't
begin
post
to
this
court
cases
on
what
is
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
have
cited
some
cases
in
our
brief
which
we
feel
come
as
close
and
which
would
a
form
basis
of
what
we
have
said
in
our
brief
and
what
we've
argued.
if
--
unless
the
court
would
have
any
questions,
i'd
be
willing
to
submit
it
asking
the
court
to
save
me
one
or
two
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
well,
it
was
publicized
in
the
newspapers
so
that
when
we
withdrew
after
being
appointed
that
plea
of
guilty,
and
we
then
entered
for
him
pleas
of
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
then
that
was
aired
on
the
newspaper
and
that's
very
similar
to
the
maryland
case
where
the
jury
knew
of
that,
knew
of
that
fact.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
well,
to
be
can
--
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
yes
sir
and
your
honor,
i'd
have
--
i'd
be
less
than
candid
if
i
--
see,
we
don't
have
a
type
of
record
we
would
have
if
this
were
a
civil
case.
it's
possible
and
this
is
entirely
outside
the
record
but
it's
possible
that
one
or
more
of
those
jurors
had
seen
this
plea
of
guilty
which
--
in
the
newspaper.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
no
sir,
it
doesn't.
but
the
record
does
show
that
those
three
did
see
the
television
program.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
i
have
--
no
sir,
it
does
not.
i
might
mention
and
then
i
will
--
i'll
close,
we
also
challenge
--
we
can't
find
any
case
where
two
police
officers
even
though
considered
to
be
special
deputies
were
allowed
to
sit
on
a
petty
jury
in
the
parish
where
they
hold
their
commissions
and
decide
a
case
such
as
this.
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
any
case.
so
here,
this
petitioner
was
faced
with
three
people
who
couldn't
possibly
wipe
out
of
their
minds
his
guilt
before
the
first
witness
was
called,
without
an
attorney
at
the
time
of
arraignment.
and
at
this
time,
it
was
critical
because
of
the
subsequent
newspaper
publicity
and
he
was
forced
to
take
two
other
jurors
who
call
themselves,
who
actually
held
deputy
sheriffs
commissions
although
of
a
special
nature.
thank
you.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
we
challenged
them
also,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
fred
h.
sievert,
jr.
used
all
our
peremptory
challenges
and
challenged
those
five
persons
and
actually,
one
additional
person
which
we
haven't
discussed
here,
five
that
we
have
challenged
in
which
we
preserved
both
in
the
--
in
our
state
supreme
court
and
in
our
writ
here.
thank
you.
