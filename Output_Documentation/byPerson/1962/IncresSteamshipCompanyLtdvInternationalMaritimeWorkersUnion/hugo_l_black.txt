well,
do
you
not
have
to
say
that
the
opinion
went
further
than
it
should
with
this
language
if
you
say
to
distinguish
it.
that
we
are
left
unconvinced,
leaves
us
convinced
that
congress
did
not
fashion
the
labor
act.
it
is
our
labor
dispute
between
nationals
of
other
countries
operating
ships
under
foreign
law.
the
whole
background
of
the
act
is
concerned
with
industrial
strikes
between
american
employers
and
employees?

that's
true,

you
get

i
thought
that
is
very
much
the
same
as
the
closing
part
of
section

--
justice
hugo

--
of
the
treaty.
but
that
still
brings
you
back
doesn't
it
to
the
question
whether
our
local
law
does
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
treaty
is

is
opened
i
presume
but
we
must
interpret
our
act
to
whether
to
include
this
jurisdiction?
