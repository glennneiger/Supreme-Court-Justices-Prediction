mr.
mcallister,
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
court
of
appeals'
opinion
was
based
squarely
on
the
arguably
subject
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
put
to
garmon.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
understand
the
distinction
that
the
solicitor
general
have
made
in
which
you've
repeated
and
adopted
between
statutory
jurisdiction
and
such
as
is
here
is
involved
and
the
matters
that
are
within
the
expertise
of
the
navy
board
such
as
it
was
involved
in
garmon
and
perhaps
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
last
year's
meba
case.
justice
potter
stewart
but
assuming
that
that
is
an
invalid
distinction,
assuming
that's
invalid.
certainly
it
is
true
that
as
of
the
time
this
case
was
before
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
this
matter
was
arguably
subject
to
the
--
to
labor
board
jurisdiction
and
because
of
the
fact
that
the
labor
board
had
assumed
jurisdiction
over
half
a
dozen
and
more
such
cases,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
the
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
court
of
appeals,
so
i
gather.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
the
final
paragraph
in
that
opinion
(inaudible)
--
it'll
be
more
helpful
to
your
--
the
point
you're
now
making
but
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
actually
technically
it's
--
they're
owned
by
liberian
corporation,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
could
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
you
could
say
on
your
analogy
that
this
is
the
shipping
of
the
west
indies
because
the
queen
mary
is
just
as
much
in
the
--
carries
i
suppose
without
knowing,
it
carries
as
many
americans
to
england
as
it
does
englishmen
to
the
united
states,
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
a
great
deal
of
this
is
done
i'm
sure
over
the
queen
mary
too,
wouldn't
it,
