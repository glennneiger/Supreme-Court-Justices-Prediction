mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
has
been
adverted
too
already
but
i
should
like
to
state
the
facts
in
it
because
i
do
not
believe
they've
been
fully
stated
as
yet.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
review
the
judgment
of
that
court
dismissing
the
complaint
herein
on
the
ground
that
the
subject
matter
of
the
action
was
arguably
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
the
national
labor
--
the
labor
act
under
the
rule
of
this
court
in
the
garmon
case.
now,
this
action
is
a
civil
action
in
part
in
the
state
court
seeking
both
damages
and
an
injunction
against
the
intentional
interference
by
the
respondent
union
with
the
internal
order
in
business
and
property
of
the
plaintiff
company.
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
is
a
foreign
corporation,
a
liberian
corporation,
fully
owned
by
italian
nationals,
resident
in
italy
and
the
officers
and
directors
are
also
italians,
resident
in
italy.
the
defendant
below
is
the
international
maritime
workers
union
which
was
jointly
formed
by
the
two
leading
american
seamen's
unions,
the
national
maritime
union
and
seafarers'
international
union.
it
was
organized
as
its
constitution
provides
for
the
stated
purpose
of
organizing
and
representing
the
foreign
seamen
on
certain
types
of
foreign-flag
vessels
and
the
type
referred
to
is
those
whose
ultimate
ownership
and
control
has
no
substantial
connection
with
the
country
of
registry.
now
the
ships
that
are
involved
here
are
two
in
number,
the
nassau
and
the
victoria.
both
were
built
in
england
--
i
am
sorry,
one
was
built
in
england,
and
one
was
built
in
ireland.
both
are
registered
in
liberia
and
by
the
liberian
flag.
both
have
almost
entirely
italian
cruise
recruited
in
genoa
and
they
signed
--
i
have
to
make
a
minor
correction
of
the
solicitor
general's
statement
of
my
incres
case.
they
signed
liberian
articles,
seamen's
articles
in
the
presence
of
the
liberian
council
in
genoa.
the
officers
are
licensed
by
the
republic
of
liberia.
the
articles
stand
approved
by
an
italian
union
and
the
record
shows
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
crew
belong
to
this
italian
union.
the
ships
are
engaged
in
the
caribbean
cruise
trade.
the
nassau
makes
a
weekly
trip
to
british
west
indies
for
some
30
weeks
each
year.
the
victoria
likewise
makes
cruises
to
caribbean
ports
during
a
period
of
about
the
same
length,
about
seven
months
every
year.
both
ships
return
to
genoa
each
year
for
refitting
and
for
leave
for
the
crew.
the
company
in
new
york
city
maintains
an
agent.
the
agent
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary.
it
is
a
new
york
corporation
and
this
agent,
like
other
agents
of
steamship
lines,
sells
tickets
and
takes
care
of
the
arrival
and
departure
of
the
ships
and
the
passengers.
the
corporation,
the
foreign
corporation
also
employs
another
new
york
corporation
known
as
cosmopolitan
shipping
corporation.
like
other
foreign
lines,
this
cosmopolitan
shipping
corporation
is
known
as
a
ship's
husband.
this
takes
care
of
such
matters
as
the
physical
ending
of
the
ship,
the
fueling
of
the
ship
between
trips,
the
hiring
of
tugboats
and
linesmen,
and
pilots,
and
docking,
and
all
such
physical
features
in
the
handling
of
a
ship.
now
the
lawsuit
below
began
when
the
respondent
union
commenced
a
campaign
under
its
constitution
to
organize
the
seamen
on
these
ships.
this
campaign
began
in
february
of
1960.
the
overt
incidence
in
this
case
began
on
friday
the
13th
of
may
of
1960.
the
respondent
union
has
admitted
in
its
answer
in
the
case
--
in
this
case
that
on
may
13th,
the
union
representatives
requested
crew
members
of
the
ss
nassau
to
engage
in
this
freight
and
indeed
they
did.
the
nassau
arrived
on
the
morning
of
may
13th
at
about
quarter
of
9
with
the
load
of
passengers.
the
passengers
were
debarked.
by
eleven
o'clock,
there
was
a
picket
line.
the
crew
takes
its
leave
normally
from
12
until
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
when
again
a
new
load
of
passengers
comes
on
board
for
the
scheduled
of
departure
at
six
o'clock.
the
crews
are
under
articles
and
under
duty
to
return
at
four
o'clock.
they
did.
but
then
as
when
the
activities
of
the
union
began
and
it
appears
in
the
record
that
they
actually
went
on
board
the
ship
and
urged
the
crew
members
to
leave.
the
crew
members
did
and
to
abbreviate
the
story,
now
all
of
the
crew
members
did
but
a
substantial
number
did.
to
abbreviate
this
part
of
the
story,
the
cruise
was
cancelled
by
midnight.
the
crew
did
not
return.
the
other
ship,
the
victoria,
arrived
in
new
york
harbor
on
sunday
the
15th
of
may.
there
was
a
minor
incident
in
the
outer
harbor.
the
victoria
was
unable
to
dock
because
the
nassau
occupied
the
pier
to
which
it
was
accustomed
to
go.
so,
it
laid
anchor
in
the
outer
harbor
in
new
york.
efforts
to
unload
the
returning
passengers
by
tender
were
interfered
with
by
a
picket
boat
of
the
respondent
union
but
a
police
launched
took
care
of
that
situation
evidently
and
at
any
rate
the
passengers
were
debarked
and
there
was
no
further
incident
on
that
occasion.
the
real
difficulty
began
with
the
victoria
on
the
following
tuesday
when
the
victoria
again
was
scheduled
to
depart
on
another
cruise.
the
passengers
have
been
embarked
by
tender
as
the
ship
still
laid
anchor
at
quarantine
in
the
harbor.
the
departure
which
had
originally
been
scheduled
for
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
had
been
postponed
until
5:30
due
to
the
problem
of
getting
the
passengers
on
board.
when
the
passengers
were
on
board
and
again
the
crew,
under
articles
--
i
mean
by
that
they
were
on
duty,
the
--
was
prepared
to
sail.
again,
a
picket
boat
came
out,
this
time
it
was
manned
by
members
of
the
crew
of
the
nassau.
but
the
record
is
clear
that
this
picket
boat
was
sent
out
by
a
mr.
levangie
(ph),
the
chief
picket
of
this
union
and
was
sent
out
for
the
very
purpose
that
was
sought
to
be
carried
out
and
it
was
successfully
accomplished.
a
picket
boat
called
through
loud
speakers
in
italian
to
the
italian
crew
members
and
urged
them
to
feign
sickness
and
not
to
sail.
this
had
its
effect
of
creating
confusion
on
shipboard
and
there
ensued
many
conversations
on
the
shipboard
which
i
need
not
detail
with
the
same
result
as
in
the
case
of
the
nassau
that
the
victoria
did
not
sail
on
its
cruise
and
it
was
cancelled,
and
the
passengers
were
debarked
by
tender.
now,
this
proceeding
was
as
i've
said
in
thought
in
the
state
court
to
seek
an
injunction
and
indeed
a
restraining
order
was
obtained
on
monday,
the
day
before
the
victoria
incident
but
it
apparently
did
not
stop
the
activities.
a
permanent
injunction
issued
on
may
25th
and
the
matter
is
now
here.
the
federal
question
was
raised
below
at
the
outset
by
the
respondent
union
by
cross
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
the
state
court
had
no
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
of
the
suit
in
view
of
the
federal
labor
act.
that
point
has
of
course
been
pressed
in
every
--
all
the
way
out
here.
the
question
presented
are
of
course
and
very
obviously
the
garmon
rule
by
the
state
court
correctly
applied
that
rule,
we
contend
that
it
did
not.
and
of
course,
more
basically
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
federal
act
applies
at
all
to
the
foreign
seamen
employed
by
a
foreign
corporation
are
unknown
on
these
ships.
these
men
of
course
were
i
repeat,
was
serving
under
foreign
article
which
were
entered
abroad
and
the
ships
were
of
course
in
territorial
waters
at
the
time
of
these
events.
now,
i
certainly
do
not
wish
to
repeat
so
many
of
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
here
already,
many
of
which
have
a
direct
bearing
upon
the
incres
case.
i
want
to
emphasize,
perhaps,
three
parts,
maybe
a
few
more.
first,
i
find
myself
in
very
fine
company.
i
find
the
solicitor
general
is
on
my
side.
i
find
that
five
foreign
governments
have
filed
briefs
in
the
incres
case
and
in
the
related
cases,
all
of
which
are
also,
i
think
on
my
side.
that
is
a
very
welcome
situation
and
i
think
the
presence
of
so
many
foreign
governments,
ones
against
any
hasty
conclusion
that
this
act
should
be
construed
without
full
regard
to
the
interests
of
the
foreign
nations
that
are
before
this
court
in
the
amicus
briefs
because
--
and
i
join
the
solicitor
general
in
one
basic
and
fundamental
point
he
made.
we
are
concerned
not
with
the
garmon
type
of
situation
of
this
court
acting
as
the
--
what
has
been
called
the
empire
of
our
federal
system
in
adjusting
jurisdiction
between
state
and
nation
but
we
are
quite
the
contrary
engaged
in
the
adjustment
if
you
like
of
power
between
sovereign
nations.
and
the
presence
of
these
--
the
governments,
i
think
it
must
again
be
emphasized.
and
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
only
one
nation
may
properly,
effectively,
if
you
like,
regulate
labor
relations
on
shipboard.
and
here,
we
are
concerned
not
with
a
tort
law
such
as
in
the
jones
act
where
there
is
a
choice
of
law
in
the
private
international
sense
that
we
are
concerned
with
a
comprehensive
regulatory
law
that
reaches
into
the
most
important
relationship
on
shipboard
to
wit
the
relation
between
the
master
and
the
crew.
we
regard
the
benz
decision
as
controlling
here
in
every
respect.
frankly,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
distinction
attempted
by
my
worthy
opponent
is
valid.
the
suggestion
is
that
in
that
case,
the
ship
was
only
temporarily
in
a
united
states
port
but
as
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
inquired
earlier,
isn't
every
foreign
ship
that
comes
to
our
harbors
in
here
temporarily.
i
believe
they
are.
i
think
the
reach
of
that
decision
is
far
deeper
than
that.
the
important
point
that
i
think
i
should
like
to
stress
is
that
the
benz
case
is
in
full
conformity
with
the
established
principles
of
international
law
under
which
we
have
lived
for
so
long.
i
would
like
to
mention
that
because
several
suggestions
have
been
made.
one
is
sort
of
the
notion
that
there
is
some
fiction
maybe
about
registration
under
the
flag
of
liberia.
and
secondly,
the
suggestion
that
there
is
some,
perhaps
some
--
even
the
word
fiction
was
used
in
connection
with
the
matter
of
registry
of
a
ship
in
liberia,
i
think,
and
elsewhere.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
republic
of
liberia
has
filed
a
brief
here
in
which
in
its
--
in
the
appendix,
it
has
listed
the
international
conventions
to
which
the
republic
of
liberia
is
a
signatory
power.
this
appears
in
appendix
a
to
the
brief
of
the
republic
of
liberia
on
page
19.
they
have
listed
eight
international
conventions:
the
intergovernmental
maritime
consultative
organization,
the
international
convention
safety
of
life
at
sea,
international
load
line
convention,
international
telecommunication
convention,
north
atlantic
ice
patrol,
the
ilo
convention
relating
to
officers,
competencies,
certificates,
the
ilo
convention
relating
to
shipowners'
liability,
relating
to
sick
and
injured
seamen
and
the
ilo
convention
relating
to
minimum
age
at
sea.
i
most
respectably
--
respectfully
submit
that
the
republic
of
liberia
is
a
recognized
maritime
power
and
its
laws
are
entitled
to
the
same
recognition
that
all
the
laws
of
any
--
of
a
sovereign
nation
that
may
come
before
this
court.
i
would
add
that
the
conventions
to
which
i
referred
relate
to
the
ships
themselves,
the
control
regulation
exercised
by
the
republic
over
those
ships.
i
would
refer
also
to
the
statement
in
the
brief
of
the
republic
of
liberia
that
they
recognized
the
duty
to
regulate
and
control
all
matters
of
employment
and
in
relation
to
the
internal
management
of
liberian
ships
and
that
it
does
regulate
these
matters
and
has
what
is
stated
in
this
brief
to
be
a
growing
body
of
law
with
respect
to
minimum
age,
working
hours,
overtime
wages,
maintenance
and
care
of
sick
and
injured
seamen,
repatriation,
and
unionization.
i
most
respectfully
submit
again
that
in
this
area,
the
republic
of
liberia
being
one
of
the
four
largest
maritime
nations
in
the
world
has
and
is
recognizing
its
obligations
in
that
respect.
and
i
believe
there
should
be
accorded
to
it
before
this
court
exactly
the
same
recognition
as
would
be
accorded
to
any
other
nation
that
comes
before
this
court.
i
emphasize
that
because
there
has
been
some
suggestions
that
there
was
something
peculiar
about
registration
under
the
law
of
that
republic.
frankly,
i
haven't
the
remotest
this
idea
while
these
italian
owners
chose
to
register
these
ships
under
the
republic
--
flag
of
the
republic
of
liberia
but
i
suppose
that's
a
decision,
a
business
decision
which
they
are
entitled
to
make
for
whatever
reasons
may
appeal
to
them
and
i
do
not
believe
that
that
decision
is
subject
to
criticism
or
review.
many
individual
much
capital
in
the
world
of
one
nation
is
registered
under
the
flag
of
some
other
nation,
in
ships
under
the
flag
of
some
other
nation.
american
capital
does
it,
british
capital
does
it,
greeks
do
it,
norwegians
do
it,
it
is
been
going
on
for
a
very
long
time.
i
sometimes
think
that
columbus
did
it.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
right.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
i
perhaps
should've
said
mr.
justice
stewart
that
a
--
in
the
early
--
in
may
when
this
matter
began
the
union
filed
a
charge
with
the
regional
office
of
the
labor
board
in
new
york
charging
us
with
having
violated
section
8
(a)
(5)
of
the
act
for
having
failed
to
bargain
with
the
--
what
they
called
the
--
to
the
chosen
representatives
of
the
crew.
that
charge
has
remained
in
the
local
office
in
new
york
every
since.
the
board
has
not
acted
upon
that
charge.
it
has
issued
no
complaint
and
has
simply
done
nothing.
but
of
course,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
that
your
question
goes
deeper
than
that
because
i
do
think
that
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
benz
case
that
the
matter
was
definitely
not
subject,
to
argue
this
subject.
we
believe
that
the
benz
decision
goes
far
deeper
than
the
particular
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
that's
what
the
dissent
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes.
that
is
correct.
now
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
i
think
it
does.
i
think
the
act
does
not
apply,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
no,
i
think
that
it
goes
--
again
goes
deeper
than
that.
i
think
the
act
must
be
treated
as
a
whole.
i
think
it
truly
is
an
integrated
whole.
for
example,
we
so
urge
in
our
brief
that
you
can't
dismember
the
act
and
give
it
what
seems
to
me
a
lopsided
application.
that
certain
features
of
it
might
be
applicable
here
relating
to
picketing,
for
example,
but
then
nothing
else
should
apply.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
but
i
think
the
distinction
there
is
simply
this,
that
in
that
case,
this
court
was
making
an
adjustment
between
two
different
acts
of
congress;
one,
the
railway
labor
act;
and
secondly,
the
labor
board
to
the
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
true
but
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
true,
but
i
think
the
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
well,
that
makes
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
yes.
well,
that
maybe
but
i
think
again,
you
are
dealing
with
the
situation
in
which
the
full
power
of
the
united
states
was
available
there.
under
the
railway
labor
act,
there's
the
certain
aspect
of
the
relation
and
under
the
labor
act
as
to
others
and
there
was
a
dismemberment
of
the
act,
i
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
correct.
precisely,
because
in
that
situation,
there
is
no
power
of
this
court
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
that
they
could
not.
that
is
correct.
we
claim
--
we
have
filed
no
charge.
we
propose
--
we
do
not
propose
to
institute
any
action
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
--
because
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
the
picket
signs
are
in
the
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
are
in
the
record,
mr.
justice.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
i've
gotten
--
i
think
they've
just
simply
said
they
had
no
dispute
with
anybody
else
except
the
crew
of
the
nassau
and
the
crew
of
the
victoria.
they
were
attempting
to
avoid
of
course
the
possibility
of
a
boycott
charge.
but
let
us
see
if
we
can
find
that
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
very
well.
no.
we
don't
think
you
can
dismember
this
act,
because
we
think
it
would
simply
wrench
it
apart
and
the
interrelationship
of
the
various
clauses
in
the
act
would
be
destroyed
because
what
congress
was
doing
in
this
act,
it
seems
to
me,
was
writing
an
act
as
a
whole.
it
was
not
writing
part
of
an
act.
it
was
adjusting
very
deep
seethed
conflicts
in
congress
in
the
determination
of
what
kind
of
picketing
was
to
be
controlled.
what
should
be
the
scope
of
the
secondary
boycott
provisions
and
all
of
this
is
related
to
an
ultimate
exercise
of
the
rights
guaranteed
under
section
7,
to
organize,
bargain,
to
represent.
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
the
what?
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
but
not
--
not
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
when
the
union
--
mr.
breck
p.
mcallister
no.
i
would
say
that
the
--
our
position
is
a
very
flat
one,
mr.
justice.
we
think
in
the
words
of
mr.
manoli
that
the
labor
board
has
no
business
here.
in
other
words,
we
do
not
recognize
the
basic
primary
right
of
an
american
union
to
seek
to
organize
the
seamen
on
a
foreign-flag
ship,
the
foreign
seaman
on
a
foreign-flag
ship
or
to
represent
them,
to
intrude
into
the
internal
affairs
of
these
ships
by
bargaining
with
these
men,
with
the
owners
of
these
ships,
or
to
do
anything
in
that
direction,
and
the
court
below,
the
new
york
court,
found
that
the
acts
of
this
union
were
illegal
and
tortious
under
state
law.
and
i
should
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
courts
to
the
decision
of
the
appellate
division
here
which
was
reversed
on
the
preemption
ground
but
a
decision
that
has
been
followed
in
a
later
case
and
represents
the
law
of
new
york
as
to
the
illegality
of
this
conduct.
we
argue
that
this
was
tortuous
and
the
court
so
held.
it
declared
the
appellate
division
in
this
case
that
the
striking
or
other
interference
with
the
internal
management
of
the
crew
of
the
vessel,
away
from
its
own
port
was
illegal.
and
i
should
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
the
appellate
division
relied
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
southern
steamship
case
against
the
labor
board
in
316
u.s.,
which
is
indeed
a
federal
decision
and
it
may
show
that
we
have
here
the
problem
of
a
federal
maritime
tort.
the
state
court
did
not
reach
that
question.
it
isn't
before
this
court
but
mr.
justice
white
asked
the
question
and
i
thought
i
should
describe
the
holding
in
the
state
court
that
this
is
indeed
illegal.
it's
just
we
respectfully
request
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed.
