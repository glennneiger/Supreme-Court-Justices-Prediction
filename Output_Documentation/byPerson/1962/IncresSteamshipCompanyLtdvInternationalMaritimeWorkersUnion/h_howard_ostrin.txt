mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
solicitor
general
in
the
empresa
case,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
the
empresa
case,
the
appellate
division
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
of
the
--
supreme
court
of
new
york
state
in
the
incres
case
have
all
held
and
all
agreed
that
the
flag
law
does
not
govern
this
situation
by
itself.
mr.
cox,
of
course,
has
some
reservations
but
judge
friendly
in
the
empresa
case
stated
the
board
is
right
in
saying,
“the
scope
of
its
powers
in
respect
of
seamen
is
not
to
be
determined
by
the
simple
notion
that
a
honduran
registered
ship
is
a
floating
piece
of
honduran
territory.
that
is
a
mere
fiction
--
a
figure
of
speech
whose
fictitious
character
was
exposed
long
ago”.
mr.
cox
--
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
mr.
cox,
in
his
brief
to
this
court
at
page
13
stated,
“the
flag
in
registry
of
a
vessel
are
not
always
decisive”.
at
page
45
of
this
brief,
he
said,
“this
is
not
to
say
that
congress
necessarily
intended
the
act
never
to
be
applicable
to
foreign-flag
vessels.
there
maybe
situations
in
which
other
considerations
may
outweigh
the
law
of
the
flag
and
may
call
for
the
application
of
the
labor
act
to
foreign-flag
vessels”.
and
again
at
page
45
of
his
brief,
he
said,
“one
would
have
to
consider
not
only
the
weight
of
this
country's
interest
but
also
the
possible
significance
if
any
of
the
fact
that
the
doctrine
that
the
law
of
the
flag
to
control
was
established
long
prior
to
the
growth
of
true
flag
of
convenience
shipping”.
the
attorney
general
in
his
brief
to
the
board
in
the
west
india
case
said,
“it
is
elementary
that
the
board
has
the
duty
in
the
first
instance
of
making
the
determination
of
whether
seamen
and
ships
involved
are
employees
and
employers
within
the
act”.
and
that
the
terms
employee
and
employer
in
the
act
draw
substance
from
the
policy
and
purposes
of
the
act,
the
circumstances
and
background
of
the
particular
employment
relationships,
and
all
the
hard
facts
of
industrial
life.
citing
national
labor
relations
board
against
e.
c.
atkins,
331
united
states,
and
he
continued
in
his
brief
to
say,
“through
its
past,
the
board
must
not
only
bring
an
appreciation
of
economic
realities
but
is
free
to
take
account
of
the
more
relevant
economic
and
statutory
considerations
in
determining
whether
or
not,
the
act
is
applicable”.
the
appellate
division
for
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
this
case
said,
“the
liberian
nationality
of
plaintiff
and
the
liberian
registry
of
the
ships
should
not
be
conclusive
of
the
character
of
the
shipping
involved”.
the
nlrb
has
inappropriate
cases
involving
american
ships
flying
foreign
flags
of
convenience
ships
has
so
determined
and
the
conclusions
are
entirely
persuasive.
so
that
when
the
--
this
case
came
to
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals,
there
was
no
question
was
that
the
board,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
noted,
had
already
asserted
jurisdiction
of
the
foreign-flag
cases.
now,
i
respectfully
submit
that
it
has
had
been
suggested,
if
not
perhaps
stated
by
judge
friendly
and
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
that
congress
did
intend
the
board
to
have
jurisdiction
over
certain
types
of
foreign-flag
operations.
and
isn't
--
it's
not
correct
to
say
that
in
those
circumstances,
surely
the
board
has
the
right
and
has
the
primary
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
or
not
in
a
given
situation,
it
should
assert
jurisdiction
over
a
foreign-flag
operation.
i
hardly
think
that
congress
when
it
wrote
the
act
carved
out
to
all
convenient
classifications
as
it
was
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
on
the
strength
of
his
own
argument,
on
the
strength
of
his
own
observation
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
does
have
primary
jurisdiction
in
this
area.
now,
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
and
if
we
are
to
apply
the
context
test
as
we
submit
was
promulgated
by
this
court
in
the
larson
case
and
i
think
was
necessarily
followed
by
judge
friendly
in
the
empresa
case.
then
i
say,
that
it
is
certainly
arguable
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
jurisdiction
from
the
first
instance
and
that
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
was
correct.
now,
we
must
remember
that
the
union
had
filed
a
charge
against
the
incres
company
which
was
pending
before
the
national
labor
relations
board.
and
as
we
learned
from
myers
against
bethlehem
steel
company
which
to
my
knowledge
has
never
been
reversed
or
modified
or
distinguished,
the
board
must
first
be
allowed
to
exhaust
its
administrative
processes
before
resort
can
be
had
to
the
courts.
and
i
say
that
even
if
a
charge
had
not
been
filed,
then
certainly
under
the
arguable
subject
doctrine,
first
promulgated
in
garmon
and
later
i
submit
extended
in
marine
engineers
beneficial
association
against
interlake
that
this
was
a
case
of
preemption
pure
and
simple.
i
know
that
my
adversary
refers
to
the
arguable
subject
doctrine
as
not
being
applicable
here
because
they
don't
reach
the
threshold
question.
but
surely
the
board
was
required
to
grapple
with
the
threshold
question
of
commerce
in
myers
against
bethlehem,
and
was
also
required
to
grapple
with
the
threshold
question
of
what
constitutes
a
labor
organization
in
interlake.
and
so
we
say
that
this
court
need
go
no
further
than
the
preemption
doctrine.
however,
should
this
court
go
or
choose
to
go
beyond
preemption
then
i
respectfully
submit
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
which
were
glossed
over
by
the
solicitor
general,
that
on
the
facts
in
this
case,
the
kind
of
shipping
that
incres
is
engaged
in
is
truly
the
shipping
of
the
united
states.
let
us
examine
the
operation
of
incres.
its
two
vessels
are
registered
under
the
law
of
liberia.
it
has,
at
least
it
claims
to
have
a
home
office
in
england
or
in
london.
what
it
does
in
that
office,
we
don't
know.
nothing
was
said
about
it
in
the
summary
hearing
before
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york.
it
is
owned
concededly
by
italian
national.
but
what
are
its
operations?
these
two
vessels
both
come
to
new
york
city
and
operate
not
temporarily,
not
casually,
not
transiently,
but
regularly
in
the
cruise
business
between
new
york
city
and
the
caribbean.
and
in
so
conducting
its
business
is
competing
with
our
own
american
flag
vessels
engaged
in
the
same
trade,
engaged
in
the
same
cruise
business.
and
how
does
it
operate?
it
operates
admittedly
through
a
wholly
owned
new
york
state
subsidiary,
the
incres
agency,
and
both
utilize
the
same
offices
at
39
broadway.
they
both
have
the
same
letterhead.
mr.
berman
jerry
is
not
only
the
president
of
incres
line,
the
foreign
corporation
and
the
member
of
its
board
of
directors,
but
he
is
also
the
president
and/or
rather
an
officer,
and
a
member
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
new
york
state
corporation.
and
he,
together
with
mr.
wilson,
conduct
the
day
to
day
operations
of
these
two
luxury
vessels.
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
they
are
owned
by
italian
nationals,
mr.
justice
black.
but
they
are
operated
exclusively
with
the
one
exception
of
once
a
year
it
takes
a
trip
to
italy.
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
technically
by
a
liberian
corporation.
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
never
have
been
to
liberian
waters
--
in
liberian
waters,
never
been
to
liberian.
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
whoa!
i
think
it's
--
we
think
it's
rather
simple
to
distinguish
this
case
from
benz.
benz
as
this
court
noted,
the
marine
corps
noted
that
its
only
connection
with
american
commerce
or
with
american
trade
was
that
it
happened
transiently
or
temporarily
to
be
in
american
waters
and
that
american
union
happen
to
have
participated
in
the
picketing.
i
have
said
--
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
well,
i
can't
accept
that,
mr.
justice
douglas
because
concededly
even
our
american
owned
vessels
are
here
temporarily
but
that
doesn't
preclude
the
nlrb
from
asserting
jurisdiction
over
them.
it's
in
a
very
nature
of
this
industry
that
ships
come
and
go
but
i
think
the
critical
question
is,
in
whose
commerce
are
they
engaged
in?
now,
clearly
in
benz
this
vessel
happened
to
be
here
almost
fortuitously.
it
was
not
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
the
united
states.
it
was
not
engaged
in
our
shipping.
it
happened
to
have
been
here
at
the
time
when
a
dispute
erupted.
but
in
this
case,
in
incres,
these
vessels
make
regular,
weekly
trips.
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
i
think
so,
mr.
justice
black
for
this
reason.
the
board
has
never
hesitated
to
assert
jurisdiction
of
a
foreign
nationals.
and
when
--
at
least
we
hope
to
that
we
are
reading
benz
correctly
when
we
say
that
what
was
intended
and
we
don't
presume
to
--
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
yes.
we
don't
presume
to
be
speaking
for
mr.
justice
clark
but
we
feel
it
was
intended
was
when
words,
american
seamen,
american
employers
were
usually
mean
that
seamen
engaged
in
american
commerce.
for
example,
the
national
maritime
union
represents
hundreds
of
aliens,
foreign
nationals
and
the
other
seafaring
unions
do.
the
nlrb
has
never
hesitated
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
foreign
employers
or
foreign
employees.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
italian
lines
case,
the
board
asserted
jurisdiction
over
all
of
the
resident
alien
employees
of
the
italian
lines
who
are
based
here
in
new
york.
well
concededly,
you
can't
face
a
vessel
in
a
stationary
place
but
i
submit
that
the
seamen
on
these
transient
vessels
as
they
must
be
should
be
accorded
the
same
rights
and
protections
under
our
act
as
are
the
seamen
who
worked
on
american
flag
vessels.
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
yes.
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
under
the
laws
of
liberia.
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
carry
american
passengers
--
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
the
distinction
is
i
think
is
a
relatively
simple
one,
mr.
justice
black.
let's
try
to
analogize
with
the
queen
mary.
the
queen
mary
is
based
and
it
operates
in
the
commerce
of
great
britain.
it
goes
from
great
britain
to
the
united
states
and
back.
these
vessels,
while
owned
by
italian
nationals
and
while
applying
the
flag
of
liberia
don't
engage
regularly
in
the
commerce
of
italy
and
certainly,
it
doesn't
touch
liberian
ports
or
liberian
waters,
and
there's
a
vast
difference
in
the
queen
mary.
it
is
truly
the
shipping
of
great
britain
and
when
it
comes
to
these
american
ports,
this
is
merely
not
--
it's
nothing
more
than
an
incident
of
the
shipping
of
great
britain.
but
i
don't
think
we
can
say
that
this
is
truly
the
shipping
of
italy.
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
(inaudible)
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
i
couldn't
say
that.
i
couldn't
say
that
either
mr.
justice
stewart
for
this
reason.
that
every
voyage
originates
in
new
york
city.
the
terminal
points
in
the
caribbean
are
not
always
the
same.
the
voyage
begins
in
new
york
and
ends
in
new
york.
the
vessels
are
provisioned
in
new
york.
all
consular
communications
are
directed
from
the
liberian
consulate
to
the
office
in
new
york,
not
italy,
not
liberia,
not
central
america,
or
the
caribbean,
but
all
of
the
provisioning
and
everything
that
is
done
is
done
in
new
york
city.
and
i
submit
--
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
well,
except
--
except
there
is
this
--
and
i
think
it's
a
real
distinction
that
on
the
case
of
the
queen
mary,
the
vessel
is
--
first
of
all,
is
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
the
flag
nation.
that's
another
vast
distinction.
secondly,
it
is
truly
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
great
britain.
now,
i
don't
think
that
we
can
say
the
same
for
the
two
incres
vessels
which
are
clearly
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
and
are
nothing
more
than
floating
hotels
and
i
might
say,
financed
with
american
capital.
there
is
a
$4
million
mortgage
loan
advanced
by
the
american
--
by
the
bank
of
america
covering
these
two
vessels
and
the
interesting
thing
is
that
the
new
york
agency
guarantees
the
payment
of
this
loan.
so
that
when
the
loan
was
first
made,
it
was
signed
by
a
mr.
barnett
as
both
officer
of
incres,
and
is
the
foreign
corporation,
and
also
as
an
officer
of
the
new
york
incorporated
agency.
when
that
loan
was
extended,
it
was
signed
by
mr.
berman
jerry
as
president
of
the
foreign
corporation
and
also
as
an
officer
and
director
of
the
new
york
state
corporation
so
that
not
only
are
these
two
vessels
regularly
engaged
in
the
trade
of
the
united
states
they
are
financed
by
american
capital.
they've
worked
hand
in
hand
together
with
a
new
york
corporation.
and
as
i
said
before,
they
received
all
of
their
consular
communications
in
their
new
york
office.
so
that
we
cannot
merely
say
that
there
are
no
connections
with
american
commerce.
now
something
--
and
much
has
been
said
on
the
subject
of
the
internal
order.
i
submit
that
a
distinction
must
be
drawn
and
has
been
drawn
between
discipline
on
board
ship
and
wages
and
powers.
and
just
as
this
has
been
recognized
in
the
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
honduras,
so
is
it
recognized
but
even
stronger
in
the
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
liberia.
and
i
refer
to
page
55
of
our
brief.
it
begins
at
page
--
the
bottom
of
page
54.
treaty
--
this
is
the
--
this
is
article
x
of
the
consular
convention
between
the
united
states
and
liberia.
and
it
says,
“a
consular
officer
shall
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
controversies
arising
out
of
the
internal
order
of
private
vessels
of
this
country
and
shall
a
law
in
exercised
jurisdiction
in
cases
wherever
arising
between
officers
and
crews
pertaining
to
the
enforcement
of
discipline
on
board
provided
the
vessels,
person
in
charge
of
long
doing
shall
have
entered
the
port
within
its
consular
district”.
and
then
the
language
continues
at
the
bottom
of
page
55
of
our
brief
and
it
says,
“such
consular
officer
shall
also
have
jurisdiction
also
over
issues
concerning
the
adjustment
of
wages
and
the
execution
of
contracts
relating
thereto
provided
however,
that
such
jurisdiction
shall
not
exclude
the
jurisdiction”,
and
here's
where
the
language
is
stronger
than
in
the
honduran
treaty,
“shall
not
exclude
the
jurisdiction
conferred
on
local
authorities
under
existing
or
future
laws”.
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
very
much
to
same.
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
well,
i
submit
--
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
well,
i
submit
that
they
must
have
been
thinking
of
our
local
and
existing
laws.
not
only
for
this
but
if
we
look
at
page
369
--
of
section
369
of
the
liberian
labor
code
which
is
referred
to
at
page
2
of
our
supplemental
statement
we
find
this
very
interesting
provision.
notwithstanding
anything
in
this
chapter,
nothing
shall
prevent
a
shipowner
or
an
employer
from
entering
into
agreements
with
employees
covering
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
as
a
consequence
of
collective
bargaining
or
otherwise
embodying
standards
not
lower
than
those
required
by
this
chapter.
now
i
submit
that
section
369,
if
read
together
with
article
x
of
the
consular
convention,
not
only
contemplates
the
making
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
but
also
contemplates
that
the
local
law
shall
have
the
right
to
make
those
collective
bargaining
or
collective
bargaining
agreements
maybe
made
under
the
local
law.
now,
since
the
vessels
doesn't
ever
touch
liberian
waters
are
we
to
expect
that
the
seamen
can
get
any
sort
of
appropriate,
realistic
representation
by
let
us
say,
a
liberian
based
union
where
they
never
go
there?
and
similarly,
since
the
vessel
only
goes
to
italy
once
a
year
at
which
time
the
crew
members
take
their
vacations
or
leave
the
employee
of
that
vessel,
are
they
to
receive
the
necessary
and
realistic
protection
that
goes
with
representation
by
a
labor
organization
from
an
italian
based
union?
or
isn't
this
more
realistic
to
assume
particularly
if
we
are
mindful
of
the
language
in
the
atkins
case
on
the
basis
of
hard
economic
reality,
that
the
best
place
and
the
only
place
where
these
seamen
can
get
the
proper
and
appropriate
representation
is
from
an
american
based
union
when
these
vessels
come
into
port,
as
they
do
every
week
and
when
their
grievances
are
processed
as
they
do
everyday.
now,
mr.
justice
white
asked
a
very
pertinent
question
in
my
adversary
report.
this
act
work
both
ways.
now,
what
about
the
application
of
the
labor
act
against
unions?
and
mr.
mcallister
was
quite
right
--
quite
correct
when
he
said
that,
“we
have
not
sought
to
invoke
the
taft-hartley
act
against
this
union.
but
the
record
factor
that
in
the
navios
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
resulted
from
the
picketing
of
the
(inaudible)
in
philadelphia
that
not
only
were
did
--
were
secondary
boycott
charges
filed
by
secondary
employers
against
this
very
union,
international
maritime
workers
union,
and
not
only
where
those
charges
processed
but
those
charges
were
settled
and
there
is
presently
pending
in
the
courts
of
pennsylvania,
damage
suits
under
section
301.
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
dissent
in
the
benz
case
noted
quite
properly
i
submit,
that
there
too
that
employers
and
foreign
employers
have
utilized
the
act
against
american
unions,
who
are
engaged
in
picketing
of
foreign-flag
vessels.
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
pardon?
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
we
say
that
if
they
are
to
be
subjected
to
their
obligations
under
the
act
and
if
these
foreign
employers
or
foreign-flag
operators
through
american
--
or
not
their
instance
can
use
the
act
against
them.
then
certainly
i
submit
that
they
are
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
act.
mr.
rhine
in
his
remarks
said
that
this
is
a
two-way
street
and
what
we
can
do
to
honduras,
honduras
can
do
to
us.
well,
i
think
this
requires
us
to
look
into
it
but
for
a
moment
to
how
the
airlines
stewardess
cases
were
handled.
there,
this
court
held
that
the
railway
labor
act
i
think
was
--
had
no
application.
there
the
employees
were
based
abroad.
in
this
case,
the
foreign
employees,
the
italian
nationals
are
based
in
the
united
states.
they
work
out
of
the
united
states.
they
are
in
the
commerce
of
the
united
states,
why
then
should
not
either
liberia
or
italy
respect
our
laws
and
respect
our
rights
to
exercise
board
jurisdiction
in
this
sensitive
area
of
labor
relations?
i
submit
that
if
this
is
true
--
a
two-way
street
and
i
believe
it
is
then
since
they
are
operating
here,
certainly,
just
as
we
had
no
jurisdiction
over
airline
stewardess,
stewardesses
who
are
operating
abroad
by
the
same
token
neither
liberia
nor
italy
should
exercise
jurisdiction
in
labor
relations
matters
over
seamen
who
work
regularly
and
only
in
the
united
states
and
out
of
united
states
ports.
i
think
--
perhaps
i'm
just
sticking
my
neck
out
just
a
little
bit
on
this.
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
that
was
the
foley
case.
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
yes,
sir.
and
that's
covered
in
our
brief.
i
would
like
to
close
on
this
note.
i
think
it
is
recognized
now
and
certainly
has
been
recognized
by
the
geneva
convention
that
there
is
little
more
to
the
law
of
the
flag
and
the
convention
has
already
adopted
--
i
see
my
time
is
up,
if
i
may
--
mr.
h.
howard
ostrin
thank
you.
the
convention
has
already
adopted
a
rule
that
there
must
be
a
genuine
link
between
the
flag
nation
and
the
vessel.
they
recognized
that
flag
law
is
involved.
and
now,
we
have
the
european
common
market
commenting
on
the
same
thing
and
i
think
it's
merely
here
set
the
very
guts
of
this
question.
the
(inaudible)
studies
pointed
out,
i
quote,
“the
extent
to
which
shipowners,
charters,
etcetera,
have
recourse
to
the
courts
of
the
flag
state
of
the
defendant
probably
reflects
to
a
greater
degree
than
most
aspects
of
shipping,
the
true
relationship
between
the
ship
and
her
flag
where
a
shipping
company
has
no
assets
in
the
flag
state
and
the
owners,
directors,
and
managers
are
not
nationals.
it
is
useless
to
have
recourse
to
the
courts
in
those
countries
as
they
cannot
enforce
their
decisions.
it
is
significant
that
even
the
owners
of
vessels
under
flags
of
convenience
prefer
to
have
their
disputes
settled
in
the
courts
of
the
maritime
countries
and
this
is
precisely
what
they're
going
to
give.”
they
don't
go
to
italy
to
this
--
to
settle
their
disputes
here.
they
don't
go
to
liberia
to
settle
their
disputes
here
but
they
come
here
and
they
utilize
our
ports.
