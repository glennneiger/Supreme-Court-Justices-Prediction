it's
necessarily
to
follow
--
necessarily
follows
from
the
fact
that
the
labor
act
may
not
apply
to
these
foreign-flag
ships
to
attempt
with
the
representation
of
election,
something
like
that.
does
it
necessarily
follow
that
the
act
doesn't
apply
to
present
the
union
from
committing
unfair
labor
practices
or
applied
to
otherwise
protected
activities?
justice

it's
wholly
on
the
ground
that
here
in
this
case
it
is
--
just
because
of
the
question
of
coverage
that
isn't
preempted,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
mean
the
piggy-back
case,
isn't
--
wasn't
upheld
with
the
railway
labor
act
applied
in
some
aspects
with
the
--
that
the
taft-hartley
act
applies
to
the
union
activities
of
boycotting?
justice

but
nevertheless
the
employer
couldn't
be
forced
to
do
anything
into
the
taft-hartley
act
in
this
case.
but
the
union
--
justice
byron

white
but
the
union
could
be
prevented
from
doing
something
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
justice
byron

white
similarly,
its
conduct
would've
been
protected
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
justice
byron
r.

that's
better
if
it
hadn't
been
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice

so
you
would
say
that
the
foreign-flag
ships
--
the
owners
of
the

came
in

should
not
be
able
to
file
a
complaint
before
the
national
labor
relations
board.
justice
byron

or
to
sue
for
damages
for
a
boycott
under
the

justice
byron

well,
what
was
on
the
--
justice
byron

white
--
you
perhaps
said
that
i

i've
forgotten,
what
was
on
the
picketing
of

were
there
signs,
the

signs,
what
was
on

points
alright,
(inaudible)
justice

there's
no
question
though,
the
entire

they
intended
to

congress
intended
the
act
to
be
applicable
to
the
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
there's
no
question
that
congress
intended
the
act
to
be
applicable
to
union
such
as
picketing
here.
justice

the

didn't
intend
it
to
be
applicable
at
the
suit
of
