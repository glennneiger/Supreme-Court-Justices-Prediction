mr.
t.
raber
taylor
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
floyd
b.
engeman,
the
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
colorado
will
share
the
argument
with
me.
i
am
going
to
open
and
i
hope
that
i
would
be
able
to
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
may
i
first
review
with
the
court,
the
facts
relating
to
marlon
d.
green
and
continental
air
lines?
marlon
d.
green
was
a
united
states
air
force
officer
serving
in
the
orient.
he
had
worked
in
air-sea
rescue
and
he
had
over
3,000
flight
hours
in
the
armed
forces.
like
many,
a
united
states
airline
pilot,
before
his
discharge,
he
had
the
ambition
to
become
an
airline
pilot.
accordingly,
before
his
discharge,
he
sent
applications
to
large
and
to
small
airlines
in
the
united
states.
in
april
of
1957,
from
the
sales
office
of
continental
air
lines
in
san
francisco,
he
obtained
an
application
form
which
was
filed
with
the
headquarters
office
of
continental
air
lines
on
april
30th,
1957.
the
application
of
mr.
green
appears
in
the
record
at
page
211.
mr.
green's
application,
as
originally
filed,
required
a
statement
of
descent
and
race
as
well
as
a
photograph.
neither
his
descent
nor
his
race
nor
the
photographs
were
supplied.
later,
the
race
was
supplied
at
the
direction
of
the
checking
out
officer,
captain
kramm
when
he
was
finally
called
to
denver.
in
june
of
19
--
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
fact,
it
was
--
continental
air
lines
had
no
knowledge
that
mr.
green
was
a
negro
until
after
he
had
been
ordered
into
denver.
in
june
of
1957,
continental
air
lines
was
seeking
to
hire
14
or
15
pilots
and
they
ordered
into
denver,
marlon
d.
green.
he
was
met
and
given
a
link
trainer
test
and
found
qualified.
the
applicants
who
were
also
found
qualified
were
five
in
number,
the
other
applicants.
on
page
7
of
the
white
brief
of
marlon
d.
green,
we
have
given
a
summary
of
the
qualifications
of
the
six
applicants
who
were
found
qualified.
the
application
blank
for
continental
air
lines
specifically
required
that
anyone
to
be
considered
would
have
to
have
minimum
flight
time
of
2,000
hours
and
be
not
over
30
years
of
age.
mr.
green
had
more
than
3,000
flight
hours
and
was
27
years
of
age.
at
that
time,
he
was
fully
licensed
as
an
airline
pilot
by
the
civil
aeronautics
authority
and
continental
does
not
dispute
that
he
was
so
licensed,
nor
does
continental
dispute
that
he
was
qualified.
in
connection
with
the
interview
at
denver,
the
personnel
office
of
continental
air
lines
was
the
place
where
other
--
where
employees
would
normally
be
sent,
mr.
green
was
not
sent
to
that
office,
but
he
was
interviewed
at
the
air
base
at
stapleton
field.
he
was
under
the
impression
--
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
he
was
discharged
as
of
may
8,
1957,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
it
was
in
june
of
1957
when
he
was
being
interviewed
in
denver.
there
was
a
july
1957
class,
the
other
men
were
found
qualified
and
ordered
to
that
class.
mr.
green
was
not
ordered
to
that
class
because
he
was
under
the
impression
that
he
would
be
pulled
one
way
or
the
other,
and
not
have
receiving
word,
he
called
continental
air
lines
and
was
told
that
he
was
still
being
considered.
however,
he
was
not
accepted
for
the
july
class,
and
in
august
1957,
he
filed
a
complaint
with
the
colorado
anti-discrimination
commission.
i
think
here
it
is
important
to
point
to
the
record
as
to
the
reason
why
or
one
of
the
reasons
why
continental
says
that
mr.
green
was
not
employed.
in
the
record
at
page
183
is
a
newspaper
article
from
the
state
journal
of
lansing,
michigan
dated
august
4th,
1957
entitled,
“job
as
airline
pilot
eludes
lansing
negro,
blames
racial
bias”.
i
think
it's
important
to
also
point
out
that
in
the
record
at
page
120
in
folio
on
359,
an
official
of
continental
said
that
the
reason
that
mr.
green
was
not
selected
for
the
july
class
was
happenstance.
and
at
page
123,
in
answer
to
questions
from
the
commissioner,
it
has
said,
“we
didn't
need
that
number
of
pilots.”
and
at
folio
183,
they
discussed
the
article
in
the
newspaper
telling
that
mr.
green's
qualifications
and
difficulties
trying
to
get
the
job.
at
record
134,
there
is
a
stipulation
that
the
article
appearing
in
the
lansing,
michigan
journal
is
substantially
identical
to
a
news
release
which
was
seen
by
a
continental
official
in
an
albuquerque
newspaper.
this
case
came
on
for
hearing
before
the
colorado
anti-discrimination
commission.
before
the
commission
hearing,
counsel
for
continental
argued
that
the
colorado
anti-discrimination
commission
did
not
have
jurisdiction
because
continental
was
under
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
was
also
a
certified
air
carrier
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board
authorized
to
transport
persons,
property
and
united
states
mail.
now,
that
argument
was
made
in
advance
to
the
hearing
and
it
appears
an
answer.
however,
i
think
we
are
here
today
confined
to
the
facts
which
were
put
into
the
record.
continental's
evidence
established
that
its
headquarters
offices,
its
personnel
office,
treasurer's
office
were
all
located
at
denver,
colorado,
that
in
denver,
colorado
it
had
800
employees
and
that
it
was
certified
by
the
cab.
but
for
an
airline
to
carry
any
united
states
mail
to
fly
in
the
airs
over
the
state
of
colorado
even
if
the
flights
were
only
from
denver
to
pueblo
or
to
denver
to
colorado
springs,
they
would
have
to
have
certification
by
the
cab.
continental
did
introduce
into
the
record
evidence
that
they
were
engaged
in
business
in
eight
states
and
the
“in
eight
states”
is
significant
because
they
did
not
introduce
any
evidence
that
they
were
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
or
in
commerce
between
the
states.
the
record
clearly
shows
that
they
had
bases
at
dallas
and
el
paso,
texas,
that
is
at
page
109.
but
texas
is
a
large
enough
state
to
adequately
take
care
of
intrastate
transportation.
they
also
show
in
the
record
at
page
107
that
there
was
a
sales
office
at
san
francisco.
now,
whether
or
not
there
was
any
activity
of
an
intrastate
agent
in
any
of
the
other
states
or
in
any
of
the
states,
no
evidence
was
offered.
they
did
state
that
they
did
business
in
new
mexico,
oklahoma,
kansas,
missouri
and
illinois
but
whether
that
was
just
fly
over
or
whether
it
was
sales
or
what
they
did,
we
do
not
know
from
the
record.
but
it's
more
important,
especially
in
view
of
the
decision
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
that
the
respondent,
continental,
did
not
introduce
any
evidence
of
any
law
of
any
other
state,
any
of
the
other
seven
states.
the
only
law
which
was
before
the
colorado
anti-discrimination
commission,
the
only
law
which
was
before
the
denver
district
court,
and
the
only
law
which
has
been
before
the
colorado
supreme
court,
has
been
the
colorado
anti-discrimination
act
and
the
federal
laws
which
had
been
introduced
in
the
record
by
reason
of
the
pleadings
and
the
statements.
it
is
important,
i
think,
also
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
record
shows
at
page
125
and
129
that
under
the
collective
bargaining
contract
with
the
american
pilots
association,
continental
had
the
right
to
hire
whomever
it
pleased
on
a
one
year
probationary
basis
and
during
that
one
year
probationary
basis,
they
had
the
right
to
discharge
without
any
question.
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
if
your
honor
please,
that
question
we
stipulated
to
after
the
first
appeal
of
the
colorado
supreme
court,
but
it
was
not
in
the
record
until
22
months
after
the
commission's
order.
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
the
states
which
were
involved
were
colorado,
new
mexico,
oklahoma,
kansas,
mississippi
and
illinois,
or
pardon
me
missouri
and
illinois.
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
if
your
honor
please,
answering
from
the
record,
there
is
no
knowledge.
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
on
the
basis
of
speaking
as
lawyer
to
lawyer,
illinois
does
have
one,
so
does
california,
but
i
feel
this
record
was
kept
lily-white
from
any
knowledge
and
therefore,
i
think
that
we
are
bound
by
the
record.
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
the
decisions
of
this
court,
your
honor,
and
the
decisions
of
the
colorado
supreme
court,
i
think
clearly
say
that
the
court
cannot.
the
decisions
are
set
forth
in
my
brief.
first
of
all,
under
the
colorado
administrative
procedure
act,
if
they
aren't
introduced
there
they
couldn't
be
introduced
later,
at
pages
28
and
29,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
you
would
find
the
authorities
which
hold
that
any
law
of
any
other
state
would
have
to
be
pleaded
or
introduced
in
evidence,
the
same
as
any
other
evidence.
at
the
bottom
of
page
28,
we
cite
the
pando
against
jasper
in
the
colorado
supreme
court
and
the
case
which
i
think
is
controlling
in
this
court
is
hanley
against
donoghue,
116
u.s.
1
at
page
6.
but
here,
in
lemon
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
used
to
say,
there
was
no
evidence
introduced
in
the
record
before
the
commission
and
that
was
controlled
by
the
colorado
administrative
procedure
act.
the
--
there
was
also
not
introduced
in
the
record
before
the
anti-discrimination
commission
and
that's
the
only
place
for
it
to
be
introduced
on
any
burd
--
any
evidence
of
any
burden,
or
expense,
or
inefficiency,
or
delay,
or
change
of
pilots
in
flight,
or
confusion
in
interstate
operations,
or
restriction
of
its
right
of
free
passage.
now,
i
think
there
is
an
important
point
which
was
introduced
by
the
united
states
into
the
record
before
the
colorado
supreme
court.
in
the
stipulation
which
was
entered
into
before
the
denver
district
court,
it
was
agreed
that
continental
was
certified
by
the
cab
to
carry
mail.
one
issue
is
whether
or
not
they
did
carry
mail
and
we
do
not
dispute
that
they
did
carry
mail,
but
insofar,
as
there
was
any
contract
with
the
united
states
to
carry
mail,
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
such
contract
introduced
in
the
record
before
the
commission.
and
before
the
colorado
supreme
court,
the
attorney
general
of
united
states,
by
affidavit,
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
colorado
supreme
court,
the
fact
that
there
was
no
mail
contract
between
continental
air
lines
and
the
united
states,
but
they
were
--
there
is
no
dispute
that
they
didn't
carry
mail.
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
i
think
it
is
not,
your
honor,
but
despite
in
all
of
these
cases,
it's
hard
to
decide
which
is
going
to
be
the
controlling
one.
one
point
after
the
carrying
before
the
colorado
anti-discrimination
commission,
the
petitioner
there
responded
here
at
continental,
appealed
to
the
denver
district
court
challenging
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
and
at
that
juncture,
mr.
green
introduced
in
the
record,
in
his
answer,
a
specific
reference
to
the
enabling
act
of
the
state
of
colorado
passed
by
the
congress
of
united
states
in
1875.
this
act,
which
was
the
first
enabling
act
of
any
state
passed
after
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
specifically
provided
that
the
enabling
act
of
the
state
of
colorado
by
its
constitution
and
the
state
would
make
no
distinction
in
civil
or
political
rights
on
account
of
race
or
color.
the
denver
district
court
after
a
hearing
--
well,
there
were
two
hearings
but
--
and
we
went
once
to
colorado
supreme
court
and
back
so
i
think
we
can
elide
that.
but
in
the
second
hearing
before
justice
black
of
the
denver
district
court,
he
accepted
the
argument
of
continental
air
lines
and
dismissed
the
complaint
of
marlon
d.
green
on
the
ground
of
preemption
and
burden.
on
appeal
to
the
colorado
supreme
court,
we
obtained
a
four
to
three
decision
in
which
the
colorado
supreme
court
has
announced
a
novel
principle
that
racial
discrimination
by
interstate
carrier
is
a
subject
which
must
be
free
from
diverse
regulation
by
the
several
states
and
governed
uniformly,
if
that
all,
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
i
think
it
is
important
to
first
view
what
federal
laws
are
involved.
first,
i
think
we
must
point
out
that
there
has
been
no
federal
fair
employment
practice
act
passed
involving
either
employers
or
employees
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
since
1944,
congress
has
perennially
considered
fair
employment
practice
act.
i
do
not
have
in
the
brief,
but
since
coming
to
washington
with
better
facilities,
i
have
obtained
the
most
recent
statement
from
the
congressional
committee
on
house
committee
on
education
and
labor,
equal
employment
opportunity
act
of
1962,
hr
or
court
number
1370
on
the
current
and
the
last
bill
considered
and
i
think
this
provision
from
that
report
is
significant.
in
recommending
a
federal
equal
employment
opportunity
act,
the
report
says,
“the
committee
wishes
to
make
quite
clear
its
intention
to
respect
the
rights
of
states
and
municipalities
which
carry
on
effective
anti-discrimination
programs
to
eliminate
and
prohibit
discrimination
in
employment.”
this
question
of
cooperation,
i
think,
has
to
be
reached
with
the
question
which
mr.
justice
goldberg
addressed
to
me
about
the
number
of
laws
in
the
various
states.
there
are
20
plus
laws
in
the
united
states
and
in
those
states,
there
are
roughly
63%
of
the
population
of
the
united
states.
i
think
we
can
appropriately
take
judicial
notice
that
the
majority
of
the
employees
in
the
63%
of
our
population
are
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
yet
to
this
day,
we
have
not
had
a
federal
fair
employment
practice
act.
now,
the
question
as
to
when
a
negro
or
when
any
minority
person
should
be
allowed
the
opportunity
of
work
certainly
goes
back
to
the
emancipation
proclamation.
and
also
to
the
--
to
the
laws
which
were
enacted
in
fulfillment
of
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
and
to
an
extent
maybe
the
fifteenth
amendment.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
when
it
was
first
considering
the
admission
of
colorado
to
the
union
was
confronted
with
the
problem
of
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
provides
that
congress
shall
have
power
to
enforce
by
appropriate
legislation,
the
provisions
of
this
article.
i
submit
that
the
legislative
history
recited
on
pages
17,
18,
19
and
20
of
the
brief
for
marlon
d.
green
indicates
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
members
of
the
senate
of
the
united
states
to
pass
appropriate
legislation
when
they
passed
the
enabling
act
for
the
state
of
colorado.
in
fact,
it
was
the
criticism
of
the
dissenting
voices
that
the
bill
as
being
introduced
or
being
acted
on
by
congress
would
have
the
affect
of
enforcing
into
the
colorado
constitution
and
its
organic
law,
a
civil
rights
bill.
now,
it
is
my
premise
that
even
though
the
congress
of
the
united
states
said
that
there
should
be
no
distinction
in
civil
or
political
rights
and
the
colorado
constitution
implemented
that
concept
in
many
details
that
there
is
still
a
residual
of
legislative
authority
in
the
state
of
colorado
and
in
its
legislative
body.
now,
what
is
this
residual
of
legislative
authority
which
is
now
in
the
state
of
colorado?
certainly,
it
is
to
fulfill
the
prohibition
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
with
regard
to
employees
who
are
employed
by
the
state
of
colorado
which
the
fourteenth
--
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
they
don't
answer
it
in
their
brief,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
that
is
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
the
exact
provision
which
--
position
which
they
take
is
reflected
on
page
19
of
their
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
they
tell
it
--
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
they
don't
differ
with
this.
they
don't
dispute
the
power.
on
page
19
of
continental's
brief,
they
tell
us,
“continental
has
not
challenged
the
authority
of
colorado
under
his
police
powers
to
enact
fair
employment
legislation
nor
to
apply
such
legislation
to
employees
of
interstate
employers
generally.
continental
has
and
does
contend
that
the
flight
crew
members
who
operate
interstate
aircraft
are
a
unique
group
already
subject
to
all
embracing
federal
control.”
now
--
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
we
would
--
that
would
be
true.
that
issue
mr.
justice
stewart
came
up
before
the
colorado
supreme
court.
the
opinion
recited,
and
i
quote
from
the
colorado
supreme
court
opinion,
this
language
negatives
the
idea
that
there
was
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
legislature
to
legislate
upon
a
matter
invoking
or
involving
interstate
commerce.
now,
that
issue
was
raised
on
the
--
on
continental's
brief,
in
opposition
to
petition
for
cert.
and
on
page
311
of
the
record
is
the
petition
for
rehearing
when
this
error
made
by
the
colorado
supreme
court
to
inadvertence
or
otherwise,
we
do
not
know,
was
brought
to
their
attention,
they
deleted
the
provision
and
let
the
federal
ground
as
the
only
ground
in
the
case.
if
i
may
--
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
oh
i
--
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
yes.
we
would
never
have
been
here.
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
well,
i
admit
that
is
their
argument.
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
the
petition
for
rehearing
and
the
deletion
by
the
colorado
supreme
court
makes
very
clear
that
the
only
grounds
in
the
opinion
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
are
all
federal.
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
well,
there
is
--
they
are
in
opposite
there
and
inexplicit
as
to
exactly
--
their
major
ground
and
their
major
thrust
is
very
clearly
in
the
one
statement
that
you
have
a
subject
matter
which
requires
national
uniformity.
now
i
--
they
did
affirm
the
action
of
the
denver
district
court.
they
did
say
that
they
might
adopt
the
rationale
of
the
denver
district
court.
therefore,
it
leads
us,
i
think,
to
the
necessity
of
facing
the
issue
squarely
and
with
that,
i
face
it
with
the
case
of
corsi,
railway
mail
association
against
corsi
which
i
submit
is
the
controlling
decision.
the
--
neither
mr.
westfeldt
nor
i
had
access
to
the
briefs
which
are
in
this
court
in
the
corsi
case
and
they
state
that
the
issues
relating
to
interstate
commerce
were
neither
raised,
nor
discussed,
nor
decided.
i
submit
that
the
briefs
and
the
record
in
the
corsi
case
abundantly
show
that
the
issues
in
that
case
parallel
the
issues
in
this
case.
before
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
it
was
very
clear
that
they
were
claiming
the
preemption
argument
therewith
under
article
1,
section
8
with
regard
to
postal
service
employees.
the
employees
in
the
corsi
case
were
u.s.
civil
service
employees
hired
by
the
united
states.
all
of
their
qualifications
passed
on
and
approved
by
the
united
states.
and
these
employees
were
engaged
in
the
business
of
writing
the
postal
cards
and
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
to
the
argument
that
the
issue
was
not
involved
in
that
case,
i
have
before
me
the
appellant's
brief
which
was
the
association's
brief
where
they
raised,
the
issue
of
commerce
was
discussed
at
page
38.
they
also
discussed
the
issue
in
the
appellant's
reply
brief
under
0.2
on
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
the
brief
for
the
corsi
appellee
at
pages
12
and
15
points
out
the
fact
that
interstate
commerce,
not
only
the
postal
power
but
also
the
commerce
power
was
being
involved
and
was
being
invoked.
also,
i
think
this
is
important.
here,
continental's
position
is
that
their
employees,
these
flight
crew
personnel,
are
a
unique
group
of
professional
people.
the
uniqueness
is
that
they
fly
aircraft.
the
employees
in
the
corsi
case
which
i
submit
is
controlling
were
under
the
provisions
of
the
lloyd-la
follette
bill
with
regard
to
all
types
of
working
conditions,
hours
of
employment
but
they
did
not
have
the
right
to
strike.
but
we
had
an
area
of
which
under
the
lloyd-la
follette
bill
of
1912
closely
parallels
the
statutes
which
continental
claims
to
be
preempted.
i
will
ask
my
associate,
mr.
engeman,
to
proceed
with
the
argument.
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
again
please
the
court.
i
open
by
directing
my
remarks
to
the
specific
language
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act
on
the
area
of
preemption.
a
careful
reading
of
the
act
will
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
not
occupied
the
field
of
the
regulation
of
air
carriers
to
the
exclusions
of
the
--
exclusion
of
the
states.
section
676
of
the
act
which
was
the
original
caa
act,
now
49
united
states
code
section
1506,
there
was
the
reenactment
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act
in
1958;
this
provision
reads
remedy
is
not
exclusive.
nothing
contained
in
this
chapter
shall
in
any
way
abridge
or
alter
the
remedies
now
existing
at
common
law
or
by
statute,
but
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
are
in
addition
to
such
remedies.
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
the
--
this
was
a
reenactment
in
1958,
the
colorado
act
or
discrimination
act
is
of
1957.
now,
i
would
say
this,
this
language,
the
fact
that
it
is
--
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
this
case
--
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
the
compliant
was
filed
april
30th
or
no
--
the
application
of
continental
was
filed
on
april
30th,
1957
and
the
hearing
was
during
june
of
1957.
the
order
of
the
anti-discrimination
commission
was
entered
in
december
of
1958.
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
that
is
correct.
i
do
think,
however,
that
it
is
significant
that
when
the
caa
act
was
reenacted
into
the
federal
aviation
authority
in
1958,
if
there
was
any
whisper
that
this
act
was
going
to
incorporate
into
the
federal
administration
authority
act,
an
anti-discrimination
provision
with
regard
to
race
and
the
employees,
and
let's
say
an
fepc
law
being
incorporated
into
the
civil
aeronautics
act,
we
would
have
not
had
the
outstanding
approval
of
the
southern
senators
of
the
united
states.
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
i
would
say
this
--
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
insofar
as
one
has
a
desire
to
protect
passengers,
one
would
not
have
a
desire
if
they
have
denied
of
some
of
our
southern
brethren
to
give
equal
protection
for
all
job
opportunities
throughout
the
airline
industry.
i
think
--
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
that
--
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
t.
raber
taylor
well,
under
the
connelly
decision,
under
the
railway
labor
act,
there
was
--
might
be
a
question
of
whether
or
not
she'd
want
to
fight
all
the
way
up
to
this
court
via
the
federal
courts
to
establish
jurisdiction,
but
again,
i
don't
think
it
is
clear.
i
think
the
prime
purpose
and
thrust
of
the
railway
labor
act
is
certainly
the
collective
bargaining
is
good
or
bad
as
it
can
be
negotiated
and
under
the
cab,
the
primary
thrust
is
in
relation
to
passengers
and
to
traffic
and
to
provide
adequate
service
for
that
traffic.
i
think
the
brief
of
the
united
states
which
has
been
filed
in
this
court
does
the
best
job
in
speaking
to
that
point
because
they
point
out
that
federal
laws
will
not
likely
be
held
to
preempt
an
area
against
state
legislation.
they
also
point
out
that
it
is
never
been
held
that
the
provisions
of
the
cab,
section
404
(b)
and
this
is
on
page
39
of
the
brief
of
united
states
that
it
is
never
been
held
that
these
provisions
were
or
are
applicable
to
discrimination
and
employment.
then,
on
page
41
they
go
into
detail
as
to
section
404
(b)
which
is
primarily
concerned
with
transportation
service.
certainly,
we
do
not
have
any
legislative
history
to
guide
us,
but
we
do
know
that
the
purpose
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act
has
been
preoccupied
with
service
either
of
the
transporting
of
property
or
the
transporting
of
passengers.
it
is
no
surprise
that
it
was
applied
for
the
protection
of
ella
fitzgerald
in
the
case
when
she
was
discriminated
against
and
i
think
it's
no
surprise
that
california
--
united
states
district
court
in
california
has
applied
it
when
a
coach
passenger
was
discriminated
against,
but
i
don't
think
it
has
any
application.
we
are
here
concerned
with
whether
or
not
the
civil
aeronautic
acts
should
be
converted
into
a
fair
employment
practice
act.
i
would
take
one
moment
to
mention
the
railway
labor
act
and
this
court
on
march
4th
of
this
year
passed
on
the
scope
of
that
act
in
the
case
of
the
brotherhood
of
local
engineers
and
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad,
relying
upon
prior
language
of
this
court
in
terminal
association
of
st.
louis
against
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
to
me,
that
language
and
the
principles
there
enunciated
would
be
determinative
of
any
argument
in
this
case
as
to
the
application
of
the
railway
labor
act.
but
primarily,
we're
confronted
with
concurrence
of
jurisdiction
even
if
there
were
jurisdiction
under
some
federal
law.
we
do
know
that
the
most
recent
legislative
history
from
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
the
consideration
of
a
fair
employment
practice
act
is
that
they
want
to
respect
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
commissions.
they
want
to
make
it
clear
that
it
is
their
intention
to
cooperate
with
the
state
and
municipal
agencies
to
eliminate
and
promote
the
--
and
lessen
the
discrimination
in
employment.
we
have
had
the
question
of
whether
or
not
flight
crew
personnel
should
stand
in
a
favored
position.
certainly,
the
employees
of
the
united
states,
the
u.s.
civil
service
employees
who
were
engaged
in
the
business
of
handling
the
mail
and
the
postal
railcars
are
much
closer
to
being
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states.
there,
this
court
made
clear
that
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
their
anti-discrimination
commission
to
bar
the
union
provision
which
excluded
from
the
railway
mail
association
all
colored
people.
to
me,
especially
after
having
an
opportunity
to
read
the
briefs
here,
i
feel
that
that
issue
is
controlling.
mr.
justice
harlan
has
inquired
about
the
case
of
pennsylvania
against
nelson.
to
me,
i
do
believe
that
there
is
a
concurrent
jurisdiction
which
was
given
to
the
state
of
colorado
by
the
enabling
act
of
1875.
certainly,
we
would
all
agree
that
sedition
has
a
higher
value
in
the
hierarchy
of
our
values
than
even
race
relation
and
yet
in
pennsylvania
against
nelson,
this
court
did
find
that
there
was
concurrent
jurisdiction.
