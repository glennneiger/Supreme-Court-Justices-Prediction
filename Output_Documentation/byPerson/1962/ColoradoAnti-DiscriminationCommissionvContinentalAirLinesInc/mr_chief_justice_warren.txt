mr.
taylor.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
he
wasn't
in
service
at
that
time,
was
he?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
at
the
time
of
this
interview,
he
had
been
discharged?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
yes,
yes.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
was
that
a
matter
of
any
significance
whether
they
did
or
not?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
mr.
engeman.
mr.
mr.

mrs.

mr.
mr.

mr.
westfeldt.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
was
there
any
contention
on
the
part
of
the
continental
that
the
others
were
better
qualified
than
this
man?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
do
you
believe
that
the
--
that
the
federal
law
is
sufficiently
comprehensive
to
afford
this
man
in
these
circumstances
a
remedy
in
the
federal
courts
or
before
a
federal
agency?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
you
think
--
you
think
there
is
such
a
proceeding.
what
kind
of
a
proceeding
would
that
be?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
so
you
ask
us
in
this
proceeding
to
hold
that
you
do
not
have
jurisdiction
in
the
state
of
colorado
but
that
the
federal
--
that
the
congress
has
given
jurisdiction
to
the
--
to
the
cab
and
that
this
man
does
have
a
remedy
in
that
--
through
that
agency.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
court
remedies
independent
of
the
cab.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
this,
i
suppose,
would
apply
to
stewardesses
the
same
as
pilots
in
your
opinion?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
yes.
do
you
have
any
response
to
what
the
attorney
general
of
new
york,
mrs.
siegel,
had
to
say
about
the
way
they
have
handled
it
with
25
different
airlines
in
their
state
without
any
--
without
a
point
of
this
kind
being
raised?
you
can
answer
that
after
--
after
lunch.
we'll
recess
now.
