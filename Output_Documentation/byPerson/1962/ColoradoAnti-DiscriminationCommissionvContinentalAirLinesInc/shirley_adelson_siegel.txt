ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
get
to
this
burning
question
of
preemption.
but
first,
i
wish
to
state
very
vigorously
that
i
am
here
today
in
behalf
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
sets
the
standard
for
these
state
laws.
we're
the
granddaddy
state
from
which
all
the
others
followed
and
i
represent
also
a
group
of
--
well
over
a
dozen
other
states
that
have
that
have
high
discrimination
agencies
and
they
are
vitally
concerned
with
the
outcome
of
this
case.
not
out
of
any
petty
jealousy
for
their
jurisdiction,
but
they
are
vitally
concerned
that
a
verdict
for
the
respondent
here
might
create
a
very
serious
vacuum
in
the
matter
of
protections
against
racial
discrimination
in
employment
and
also
unsettle
the
foundations
of
our
jurisdiction
because
--
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
new
jersey,
very
quickly
followed
in
our
heels
made
its
law
effective
the
same
date
[attempt
to
laughter]
but
we
had
--
it
developed
the
law
as
the
result
of
a
traveling
commissions
holding
hearings
and
presenting
proposed
bills
from
one
of
the
state
to
the
other
period
of
year
or
so,
and
so
we
think
that
--
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
they
may
have
done
that
too,
but
i
believe
that
new
jersey
would
be
the
first
to
yield
to
us
the
honor
as
the
--
a
private
jurisdiction
in
this
area.
they
certainly
are
in
touch
with
us
for
advice
in
our
administrative
construction
often
enough.
i
am
sorry,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
guess
i
regret
that
my
valuable
time
may
be
slipping
in
this
give
and
take.
we've
have
lot
of
experience
in
new
york.
we've
had
thousands
of
cases
involving
this
racial
discrimination
in
employment.
and
approximately
7%
of
these
have
involved
interstate
carriers.
in
the
early
years,
there
were
many
railroad
cases
and
in
these
many
dozens
and
dozens,
in
fact,
a
couple
of
hundred
railroad
cases,
the
railroads
perhaps
they
squirmed.
i
don't
know
what
went
on
behind
their
common
experience,
but
they
accepted
the
conciliation
procedures
of
the
state
commission,
the
first
negro
brakeman
was
put
on
in
one
railroad
and
so
on.
and
these
breakthroughs,
each
of
them,
although
maybe
only
a
handful
of
persons
were
concerned
had
an
enormous
significance.
as
i'm
sure,
this
court
will
appreciate.
i
need
not
belabor
the
point
here.
in
the
case
of
the
airlines,
we
have
had
to
date
done
business
with
25
airlines
all
of
an
interstate
in
new
york
alone.
now,
these
airlines
haven't
gone
screaming
to
the
civil
aeronautics
board
to
give
them
the
statement
of
preemption
to
bail
them
out.
i
might
mention
it
has
been
suggested
to
me
about
the
colloquy
here
this
morning
that
the
arabian-american
oil
company
didn't
hesitate
to
go
screaming
to
the
secretary
of
state
when
our
state
commission
against
discrimination
was
asserting
jurisdiction
over
their
employment
practices
in
new
york,
and
get
a
letter
which
stayed
the
hand
of
a
commission
for
a
time,
made
it
hesitate,
the
matter
had
to
go
through
the
courts
until
that
proceeding
was
settled.
not
only
in
our
experience
was
close
to
a
hundred
cases
involving
airlines,
almost
half
of
those
involving
flight
crew
of
pilots,
as
well
as
hostesses
and
we
had
perhaps
the
dubious
honor
of
having
been
responsible
for
the
first
negro
hostesses,
negro
stewardesses
on
airlines
in
our
region.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
the
mohawk,
right.
not
one
of
these
airlines
has
gone
to
court
about
this.
we've
had
no
litigation
on
the
question
of
our
jurisdiction
over
interstate
employers
of
any
kind
and
no
litigation
over
the
question
of
preemption
in
the
case
of
carriers.
now,
on
the
preemption
point,
i'm
sure
that
it's
in
the
--
a
back
of
the
minds
of
a
--
of
all
of
you,
but
i
feel
that
i
must
state
again
and
that
is
that
even
if
the
civil
aeronautics
act
or
the
railway
labor
act
which
was
--
has
also
then
brought
to
question
here
should
create
a
right
in
this
field
and
we
think
that's
pretty
doubtful,
but
even
if
it
should,
that
wouldn't
close
our
question
because
there
certainly
is
a
great
deal
of
precedent
in
this
court
for
permitting
state
regulation
which
does
not
burden
commerce
and
is
in
harmony
with
the
national
policy
to
proceed.
in
fact,
in
one
of
those
cases,
california
v.
zook,
there
was
some
language,
which
we
found
particularly
interesting
for
this
case
that
we
cite
at
the
page
in
our
brief
and
that
was
that
--
sorry.
i'm
sorry
i've
been
unable
to
put
my
hand,
oh
yes,
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
intended
to
deprive
itself
of
effective
aid
from
local
officer's
experienced
in
a
kind
of
enforcement
necessary
to
combat
this
evil,
aid
a
particular
importance
in
view
of
the
icc's
small
stock
than
citing
some
other
reports
of
the
icc,
that's
california
v.
zook,
336
u.s.
725.
now
--
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
yes.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
yes,
i
would
like
to.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
before
every
congress
since
1942.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
i
thank
you
for
making
that
point
and
because
it's
certainly
our
belief
--
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
--
that
it
wouldn't
have
in
this
area
a
fair
employment.
experience
has
shown
that
the
only
effective
approach
is
a
rather
elaborate
administrative
procedure
which
includes
a
provision
for
conciliation
and
so
on.
now,
this
language
about
discrimination
in
the
civil
aeronautics
act
is
--
it
reflects
in
our
opinion,
a
time
worn
common
law
right
of
equality
of
opportunity
for
service.
it's
an
integral
part
of
our
tradition
going
way
back
before
there
was
a
statute
that
common
carriers
should
not
discriminate
and
i
think
basically
that's
the
throb,
the
heartbeat
before
the
word
discrimination
and
the
language
in
air
transportation,
the
language
in
service
appears
everywhere
in
the
civil
aeronautics
act
where
you
have
language
about
discrimination.
section
402
(c)
declares
that
a
policy
of
the
act,
the
promotion
of
adequate,
economical
and
efficient
service
by
air
carriers
without
unjust
discriminations.
section
484
(b)
provides,
no
air
carriers
shall
subject
any
particular
person
in
air
transportation
to
any
unjust
discrimination.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
i
am
a
liberal
constructionist
that
i
would
personally
and
i
believe
that
i
may
say
for
the
state
of
new
york
that
it
wouldn't
make
us
unhappy
if
this
language
were
extended
to
cover
that,
but
candidly,
we
don't
think
it
does.
if
it
is,
that's
fine
because
we
believe
that
it
would
certainly
not
displace
our
jurisdiction
in
any
event.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
it
is
not
fatal
and
of
course
in
an
area
like
this
where
this
police
power
of
the
state
has
such
a
strong
interest
in
the
enforcement
of
the
regulation,
unless
there's
a
clear
congressional
indication,
a
clear
congressional
indication
that
our
jurisdiction
has
to
be
displaced,
such
displacements
would
not
take
place
and
on
the
contrary,
there's
perfect
harmony
here.
burden
hasn't
been
shown
and
it's
very
similar
i
believe
to
the
railroad
cases.
a
man,
a
locomotive
engineer
who
drives
in
interstate
railroad
has
the
nation's
safety
in
his
hand
and
in
the
same
way
as
an
airline
pilot.
it
just
translates
in
different
terms.
the
railroads
are
very
heavily
regulated
by
the
national
government
and
yet
this
court
again
and
again
has
sustained
local
regulations
enacted
under
the
police
power
which
for
example
required
all
locomotive
engineers
to
take
an
eye
examination
or
said
that
men
who
were
driving
trains
would
have
to
have
an
examination
and
if
they
were
--
if
intemperate
habits,
they
would
be
disqualified,
state
rules
that
require
full
train
cruise,
state
rules
for
adding
a
caboose
to
the
train
for
the
comfort
of
the
railroad
employees,
these
had
been
sustained.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
well,
if
you
examine
those,
for
example,
southern
pacific
against
arizona,
a
case
--
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
that
was
the
length
of
the
train.
it
was
a
dramatic
case
and
there
it
was
said
like
these
passengers
in
hall
v.
decuir
every
time
you
came
to
a
state
boundary,
you
have
to
stop
and
change
the
length
of
your
train
and
so
on.
there
was
an
element
of
burden
there
too.
but
--
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
if
you
will
note,
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
that
case
that
it
was
not
so
clear
as
the
majority
recorded
there
that
this
statute
really
was
necessary
for
safety.
they
said
that
statistics
have
shown
that
because
the
length
of
the
train
was
limited
you
therefore
had
to
have
more
trains
that
maybe
in
the
long
run,
you
ended
up
with
just
as
many
accidents,
and
so
the
statute
itself
was
of
some
questionable
value.
we
don't
have
any
such
problems
here.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
--
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
i
would
just
like
to
say
in
closing
that
so
far
as
we're
concerned,
we
are
dealing
here
with
an
enormous
problem
and
we
in
new
york,
i
think,
know
more
than
anybody
the
kind
of
consistent
attention
that
a
problem
like
this
requires
to
bring
about
results
and
of
the
--
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
[attempt
to
laughter]
new
york
has
some
useful
experience
on
the
basis
of
which
--
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
1945.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
45.
ms.
shirley
adelson
siegel
new
york
law
became
effective.
and
we
say
only
that
it's
not
the
issue
here
that
the
federal
government
has
acted
in
such
a
clear
way
and
so
demonstrated
it
so
unmistakably
it's
a
right
to
preempt
this
field.
we
have
a
going
pattern
of
state
laws
which
are
doing
a
job.
they
have
not
resulted
in
turmoil
in
interstate
transportation.
on
the
contrary,
they
have
been
doing
an
effective
job
and
have
worked
in
accordance
with
the
highest
national
policy
and
we
earnestly
urge
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
colorado
supreme
court.
thank
you.
