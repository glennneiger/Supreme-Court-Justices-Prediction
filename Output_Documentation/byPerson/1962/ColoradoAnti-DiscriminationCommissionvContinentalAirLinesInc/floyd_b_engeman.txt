mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
mr.
chief
justi
--
justice
and
members
of
the
bench.
i
would
like
to
explain
briefly
why
i
did
not
open
this
morning.
actually,
mr.
taylor's
case
is
listed
as
the
second
case,
but
mr.
taylor
had
the
privilege
of
being
connected
with
this
case
throughout
its
trial
before
the
commission
in
the
district
court
and
both
the
times
it
was
in
our
local
supreme
court.
i
was
pleased
to
come
into
the
case
after
it
had
been
decided
by
our
local
supreme
court.
i
thought
for
this
reason
that
mr.
taylor
was
much
more
familiar
with
the
details
of
the
facts
on
how
this
case
actually
got
to
this
court.
i
think
that
our
local
supreme
court,
either
purposely
or
by
inadvertence,
jumped
to
a
conclusion
that
was
not
warranted
when
they
made
the
statement
that
mr.
taylor
has
called
to
the
courts
attention
which
is
found
in
our
supreme
court
decision
and
is
recited
in
the
record
of
page
294
that
racial
discrimination
by
interstate
carrier
is
a
subject
which
must
be
free
from
diverse
regulation
by
the
several
states
and
govern
uniformly,
if
at
all,
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
and
then
they
say
the
opinions
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
have
established
the
rule.
and
they
quote
the
famous
case
of
hall
versus
decuir
which
was
decided
in
1877
and
perhaps
if
we
were
in
1877,
it
might
be
that
our
colorado
statute
would
to
some
extent
fall
within
that
case.
however,
we're
not
in
1877,
we're
in
1963
and
many
things
have
changed
since
that
time.
the
court
further
relied
upon
the
fact
that
hall
versus
decuir
had
been
cited
in
the
case
of
morgan
versus
virginia
in
1946
and
later
in
portland
cement
company
versus
the
city
of
detroit
that
was
decided
in
1960
which
i
recall,
mr.
justice
stewart
wrote
the
opinion.
this
case
of
hall
versus
decuir
involved
a
statute
which
was
passed
in
--
shortly
after
the
civil
war
wherein
a
person
in
louisiana
had
the
right
to
share
space
with
a
person
of
another
race.
and
this
court
decided
at
that
time
that
this
indeed
would
cause
a
burden
upon
interstate
commerce
because
at
that
time,
mississippi
could
have
legislation
that
did
in
fact
discriminated.
so
if
you
had
a
colored
and
a
white
person
riding
in
the
same
passage,
same
cabin,
when
it
came
to
mississippi,
they
would
have
to
change
their
cabin
space
or
this
was
a
possibility.
however,
when
you
get
to
the
case
of
morgan
versus
virginia
decided
in
1946,
you
have
the
other
side
of
the
picture.
virginia
at
that
time
had
a
statute
which
provided
that
a
bus
traveling
through
virginia
had
to
separate
the
negro
and
the
white
passengers,
a
completely
opposite
situation.
and
it's
true
that
in
that
situation,
this
court
did
strike
down
that
segregation
statute
in
virginia
which
applied
to
interstate
commerce.
we
think
one
of
the
things
that
our
supreme
court
failed
to
recognize
is
that
this
was
a
discrimination
statute
which
operated
against
the
national
policy.
in
other
words,
this
was
before
a
period
of
time
with
our
line
of
cases
beginning
with
shelley
versus
kraemer,
brown
versus
the
board
of
education,
barrows
versus
jackson,
all
of
which
this
court
is
very
familiar
with.
i
think
the
important
point
in
hall
versus
decuir
which
our
supreme
court
seemed
to
refuse
to
recognize
is
a
statement
in
that
decision
when,
which
this
court
said
after
delineating
certain
rules
concerning
interstate
commerce,
the
burden
upon
it
and
the
sort
of
thing
said
that
it
is
far
better
to
leave
a
matter
of
such
delicacy
to
be
settled
in
each
case
upon
the
view
of
the
particular
rights
involved.
in
other
words,
hall
versus
decuir
doesn't
per
se
say
that
discrimination
or
anti-discrimination
is
a
no
man's
land
that
can't
be
touched
by
state
legislation.
it's
only
if
the
statute
involved
creates
a
burden
and
it
has
to
be
something
more
than
just
a
slight
inconvenience,
there
has
to
be
a
direct
burden
then
the
court,
this
court,
will
look
at
that
situation
and
at
that
time
decide
whether
or
not
that
statute
should
be
stricken.
i
think
another
thing
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
in
1877,
it
was
permissible
for
a
state
to
discriminate
if
this
was
the
philosophy
of
the
people
of
that
state
against
a
person
of
the
colored
race.
in
fact
in
1883,
the
civil
rights
cases
on
page
25,
we
find
comment
along
a
line
that
certain
privileges
enjoyed
by
persons
of
the
white
race
are
not
obtainable
by
persons
of
the
colored
race,
paraphrasing
that
statement.
however,
time
as
changes
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
our
philosophy
changes
and
for
this
reason,
i'm
sure
the
court
has
entered
the
decision
to
which
i
have
referred
previously,
shelley
versus
kraemer
and
et
cetera.
i
refer
to
those
on
page
12
of
my
brief.
i
think
that
our
supreme
court
completely
missed
the
point
when
they
relied
upon
morgan
versus
virginia
as
supporting
the
hall
versus
decuir
case.
now,
i'm
not
saying
that
morgan
versus
virginia
didn't
agree
with
the
principle
involved
in
hall
versus
decuir,
but
that
principle
is
not
that
discrimination
is
a
no
man's
land.
it
merely
says
that,
if
there
is
a
burden
then
we
will
look
at
it
and
perhaps
strike
the
statute.
and
i
agree
that
in
morgan
versus
virginia,
in
view
of
this
statute
requiring
the
separation
of
the
passengers,
you
do
have
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
another
case
they
refer
to
is
boynton
versus
virginia,
again
a
case
of
a
terminal
facility,
a
virginia
statute
requiring
separation
of
people
in
their
eating.
again,
this
court
struck
that
statute
as
being
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
i
think
that
if
one
concludes
that
it
is
still
lawful
to
discriminate
against
negroes
in
this
united
states,
you
have
to
completely
disregard
the
precedent
setting
cases
which
have
clearly
established
that
this
is
not
possible.
and
i
think
this
comes
to
the
point
that,
as
mr.
taylor
pointed
out,
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record,
and
i
think
that's
what
this
court
must
consider,
of
any
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
i
ask
myself
in
the
brief
and
i
ask
the
court
the
question
on
page
14
but
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
would
indicate
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
is
it
possible
if
there
would
be
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce?
i
have
struggled
to
find
any
sort
of
a
situation
that
would
in
fact
create
this
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
there
was
a
bit
of
illusion
in
the
record
at
page
--
record
84
that
because
a
negro
might
fly
an
airplane
that
there
would
be
disharmony
in
the
cockpit
and
also
at
record
92
and
115,
but
actually
these
statements
were
never
substantiated
by
any
competent
evidence.
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
well,
i'm
sure
they
do.
i
--
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
there
is
none.
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
in
fact
i
--
i
question
if
there
wouldn't
be
less
of
a
problem
in
having
a
negro
and
a
white
pilot
controlling
this
plane
than
there
would
be
if
you
had
a
negro
passenger
perhaps
in
texas
or
someplace
boarding
the
plane.
mr.
taylor
has
referred
to
the
enabling
act.
i
think
that
this
to
some
extent
is
a
delegation
from
congress
to
colorado
to
enact
legislation
that
would
prohibit
discrimination
against
people
because
of
race.
now,
i
think
that
the
case
is
perhaps
--
answers
this
question
of
whether
there's
a
conflict
with
federal
policy
or
with
federal
statute
is
the
huron
portland
cement
company
case
which
i
refer
to
on
page
16
of
my
brief
wherein
you
have
the
situation
of
a
steamship
that
was
licensed
under
federal
statute
and
that
license
there
authorized
and
went
to
the
inspection
of
the
boilers
as
to
whether
the
boilers
were
safe
or
whether
they
were
not
safe.
the
city
of
detroit
had
a
--
an
ordinance
requiring
certain
precautions
in
view
of
the
smoke
that
they
emitted.
and
this
court
there
held
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
this
boat
was
federally
licensed
instilled
in
the
city
of
detroit
to
make
it
change
--
make
it
change
its
boilers
so
that
it
didn't
emit
the
smoke.
now,
this
certainly
raises
two
points.
first
of
all,
it
seems
to
me
there
would
very
--
there
would
possibly
be
a
direct
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
and
secondly,
that
you
do
have
both
state
and
federal
legislation
acting
on
almost
the
same
thing,
in
other
words,
the
boiler
system
of
the
steamship.
i
think
that
one
reason
the
huron
portland
cement
company
case
is
important
is
the
fact
that
on
page
480
--
448
of
362,
united
states
border,
the
court
said
there
that
the
record
contains
nothing
to
suggest
the
existence
of
any
such
competing
or
conflicting
local
regulations.
the
point
was
raised
that
it
might
be
possible
that
there
would
be
more
than
one
regulation
and
the
steamship
might
have
a
boiler
that
would
be
alright
say
for
the
city
of
detroit
but
if
it
went
someplace
else,
it
wouldn't
be
proper
there.
that's
exactly
the
point
that's
been
raised
in
our
case
and
i
think
that
in
this
huron
case,
it
was
much
more
possible
that
you
could
have
these
conflicts.
i
don't
believe
that
we
have
any
such
conflict
in
our
--
in
the
case
at
bar.
as
it's
not
shown
in
the
record
and
i
seriously
question
whether
any
can
be
shown.
now,
mr.
taylor,
i
think,
has
covered
quite
adequately
the
railway
mail
association
versus
corsi.
and
i
think
that
as
this
court
has
now
been
refreshed
by
mr.
taylor
that
the
problem
of
the
conflict
with,
and
the
question
of
interstate
commerce
was
considered
in
those
briefs
and
the
court
rejected
that
argument.
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
your
honor,
i'm
afraid
that
at
the
moment,
i
do
not
have
that
decision
in
mind.
a
last
case
which
i
think
is
also
in
this
area
and
of
importance
is
the
case
of
bob-lo
excursion
company
which
we
--
i
referred
to
on
page
18
of
brief.
i
must
admit
that
this
case
to
some
extent
is
of
limited
application
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
excursion
boat
in
a
true
sense
probably
didn't
operate
in
interstate
commerce.
it
was
operating
in
a
very
localized
area.
i
would
like
to
move
on
by
my
--
to
the
two
questions
that
i
think
are
of
some
importance
that
has
been
raised
by
respondent.
i
think
this
question
was
raised
briefly
from
the
bench
by
the
court
this
morning
as
to
whether
there
is
a
state
issue
in
the
decision
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
that
would
prohibit
this
court
from
rendering
a
decision
at
this
time.
i
think
respondent's
counsel
would
like
for
this
court
to
find
that
there
is
such
issue
and
i
feel
quite
confident
on
page
14
and
15,
they
have
argued
that
point
well
to
this
court.
i
think
the
--
the
fact
of
that
argument
is
that
they
are
arguing
the
first
decision,
and
i
shouldn't
say
the
first
decision,
i
should
say
the
preliminary
decision
in
our
supreme
court
in
the
case
which
is
for
review
here.
mr.
taylor
with
design
brought
to
the
attention
of
our
local
supreme
court
in
his
petition
for
rehearing
and
pointed
out
that
if
the
colorado
supreme
court
made
the
statement
to
which
continental
has
referred,
and
if
that
remained
in
the
case
then
there
was
no
need
for
four
or
five
pages
of
argument
or
four
or
five
pages
of
decision.
that
took
care
of
it
by
itself
and
i
think
the
court
realized
that
if
they
did
retain
this
point
of
view
that
they
were
indeed
making
statements
that
were
not
necessary.
and
i
am
serious
--
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
well,
i'm
sure
that
they
--
our
local
supreme
court
did
not
take
that
out
of
their
decisions
so
that
this
case
could
be
brought
to
this
court.
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
of
the
district
court
--
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
yes.
well,
they
did
in
a
sense
--
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
this
i
must
confess,
they
made
statements.
i
have
difficulty
in
arriving
at
a
conclusion
as
to
what
they
actually
did
decide.
if
this
again
were
true,
they
could've
affirmed
our
trial
court's
decision
without
written
opinion.
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
yes,
they
did.
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
this
is
true.
i
agree,
your
honor.
but
i
believe
that
in
reading
our
decision
as
a
whole
and
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it's
a
split
decision,
you
do
definitely
have
before
this
court
a
federal
issue.
i
think
the
thing
they
were
really
concerned
about
is
can
the
statute
of
colorado
be
applied
to
an
interstate
carrier?
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
well,
i
think
in
order
--
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
this
is
true.
i
would
i
agree
with
this
your
honor
but
our
statute
is
framed
without
any
limitation.
it
says
employer
of
six
or
more
when
it
was
called
to
the
attention
of
our
court
that
this
is
what
the
statute
says,
they
agreed
with
the
petition
for
rehearing.
they
agreed
that
it
applied
and
then
they
took
it
out
of
their
opinion.
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
well,
perhaps
i'm
the
one
that
caused
that
error
if
it's
an
error.
we
just
deliberated
it,
your
honor.
about
including
the
opinion
as
originally
written,
it
has
been
removed
from
the
opinion
and
the
opinion
as
it
now
stands
and
the
reported
decision
does
not
include
this
language.
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
yes.
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
that's
right.
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
that's
right.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
that's
right,
this
is
a
sort
of
--
i
have
trouble
with
this
myself
on
our
local
court.
the
opinion
always
takes
the
date
that
it
has
when
it
was
originally
issued
although
they
may
have
revised
it
and
so
forth.
well,
i
feel,
your
honors
that
beyond
any
doubt,
this
statute
of
colorado
does
not
create
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
there's
been
no
showing
that
it
does.
there
are
no
statutes
that
specifically
apply
and
for
this
reason,
i
believe
that
the
decision
of
our
local
supreme
court
should
be
reversed.
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
yes.
your
honor,
i'm
going
to
reserve
that
problem
to
be
covered
by
counsel
which
will
follow
me.
mr.
floyd
b.
engeman
if
it's
all
right
with
the
court,
thank
you.
