mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
it's
inescapable
and
it's
not
disputed
that
in
this
case
we
have
an
order
of
a
state
commission
which
is
unskilled
in
the
field
of
aviation
that
has
ordered
a
federally
certificated
commercial
airline
to
hire
a
particular
person
as
a
pilot
to
fly
its
aircraft.
this
is
the
fact
and
tenor
and
meaning
of
the
order.
now,
how
did
the
commission
get
to
that
point?
the
commission
got
to
that
point
by
acting
as
it
is
required
to
act
under
the
colorado
statute
in
any
case
over
which
it
has
jurisdiction.
the
colorado
prohibition
against
discrimination
is
against
discrimination
in
many
facets
of
an
employer-employee
relationship
where
the
employer-employee,
i
beg
your
pardon
is
and
i
quote
“otherwise
qualified.”
now
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
yes
i
will,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
green
arrived
in
denver
on
june
24th.
he
was
there
for
the
25th
and
26th,
and
he
took
a
link
trainer
check
test
and
he
had
an
interview
and
he
had
a
flight
test.
continental's
decision
after
that
action
was
that
green
was
eligible
and
was
qualified.
he
was
wired
by
another
one
of
the
supervisory
people
wyler
on
july
5th
that
he
hadn't
been
included
in
the
july
class.
that
wire
went
to
his
old
home
address
in
arkansas
instead
of
his
michigan
address.
so
mr.
green
on
the
8th
called
continental,
talked
to
mr.
bell,
vice
president
of
personnel.
mr.
bell
told
him
that
he
was
eligible
and
was
qualified,
but
he
hadn't
been
included
in
the
july
class.
the
record
in
the
case
shows
that
there
was
a
particular
file
where
all
of
the
eligible
and
qualified
pilots
named
and
applications
were
kept.
on
august
6th,
right
about
august
6th
which
is
a
month
later,
the
associated
press
news
story
which
continental
saw
from
an
albuquerque
newspaper,
but
which
it
described
at
some
length
in
the
record
and
the
source
of
it
of
course
was
mr.
green's
discussion
with
the
reporter
in
lansing,
michigan
and
they
picked
up
there.
at
that
point,
continental,
mr.
bell
exercising
its
judgment
said,
“here's
the
man
with
not
only
nationwide
notoriety,
but
he
also
has
a
fair
employment
practice
cases
pending
against
other
aviation
employer
--
employers
seeking
a
job.
we
don't
like
this
notoriety.
i
don't
know
if
it's
good
for
him
or
not,
but
we
don't
like
it
if
he
is
going
to
follow
ahead
with
those
cases
it
will
interrupt
this
training
and
service
in
colorado.”
so,
it
was
at
that
point
and
upon
receipt
of
that
information
that
the
company
decided
that
green
wasn't
qualified
for
the
position.
there
is
no
question
about
his
being
able
to
apply.
we
never
said
that.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
that's
right.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well
that
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
mr.
justice
goldberg
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
no,
the
record
does
not
show
specifically
or
really
even
indirectly.
it
shows
that
the
continental
people
and
the
investigators
had
not
been
able
to
determine
a
specific
reason.
but
the
point
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
yes,
i'd
say
that
the
reason
were
--
i
would
say
that
the
reasons
were
that
there
were
at
least
six
and
maybe
more
by
that
time
named
in
the
file
and
the
first
four
that
came
off
the
top
were
employed
and
put
into
the
regular
program
which
first
includes
pilot
training
and
then
during
the
first
year
means
probationary
employee.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
your
honors
let
me
say
that
i
do
not
believe
if
that
is
entirely
necessary.
we
do
have
a
commission
finding
here.
the
commission
finding
is
clear.
it
says
it's
conclusive
that
continental
discriminated
on
account
of
race,
but
there
is
no
court
decision
in
colorado
either
in
the
trial
court
or
in
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
not
by
this
court.
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
but
even
proceeding
from
that
point,
and
i
don't
see
any
point
spending
any
more
time
on
it,
the
basis
or
one
of
the
necessary
elements
in
the
conclusion
of
the
commission
that
continental
discriminated
on
account
of
race
was
its
decision
as
to
pilot
qualifications
which
not
only
made
a
decision
that
he
was
qualified,
but
that
he
was
better
qualified
than
any
of
the
other
applicants.
this
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
was
that
when
the
check
pilot,
he
didn't
grade
according
to
different
standards
of
qualification.
he
just
said
okay
and
not
okay.
now,
it
is
true
that
this
commission
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
correct.
it
is
true.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
the
contention,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
that
no
rating
was
made
as
to
who
was
better
qualified
and
who
wasn't
better
qualified.
i
really
believe
that
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
because
i
don't
believe
that
if
the
policy
of
continental
air
lines
or
any
other
airline
to
really
grade
finally
on
initial
pilot
flight
checks.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
no,
we're
not.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
i
think
it
is
here
in
that
posture,
mr.
justice
harlan,
but
i
also
think
that
in
considering
this
statute
and
the
order
of
the
commission
that
is
before
the
court,
the
fact
that
the
statute
confers
upon
the
commission
a
duty
to
pass
upon
employee
qualifications
is
important
and
should
be
brought
out
to
the
court
because
in
that
argument
on
the
diversity
of
state
regulation,
this
is
another
area
of
discretion
and
judgment
and
decision
by
the
particular
commission
that
has
to
be
exercised
and
which
we
think
was
--
would
result
in
inconsistent
and
conflicting
result.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
and
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
i
will
proceed,
your
honor,
first
to
the
--
first
point
of
--
part
of
our
legal
argument,
the
independent
state
ground.
we
know
and
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
the
colorado
supreme
court
did
delete
one
sentence
from
the
opinion
in
its
original
form.
the
only
order
entered
by
the
colorado
supreme
court
at
that
time
is
the
order
denying
petitions
for
rehearing
on
page
314
of
the
record.
two
petitions
have
been
filed,
one,
by
my
brother
mr.
taylor
for
mr.
green
on
another
subject,
and
one
by
the
commission
asking
that
the
particular
sentence
be
deleted.
the
order
denying
the
petitions
for
rehearing
makes
no
remark
whatsoever
about
the
sentence
deleted.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
the
sentence
was
in
fact
deleted.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
the
only
place
where
the
actual
language
of
the
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
on
311,
the
second
sentence
in
the
second
paragraph
is
the
particular
--
it
should
be
in
quotation
marks
or
something
like
that
on
the
record
but
that's
the
sentence
that
was
stricken
out
of
the
colorado
supreme
court's
opinion
and
in
the
original
opinion
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
this
language
negative
the
idea
that
there
was
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
legislature
to
legislate
upon
a
matter
involving
interstate
commerce.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
without
comment
and
the
order
--
at
least
the
language
of
the
order
is
just
a
denial
of
the
petitions
for
rehearing.
it
makes
no
reference
to
the
modification
of
the
opinion
or
any
explanation
thereof.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
that's
right,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
but
even
the
petition
for
rehearing
doesn't
go
to
any
of
the
other
things.
it
is
in
the
opinion
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
which
i
maintain,
i
argue,
was
still
there
and
still
controlling.
now,
the
particular
items
to
which
i
refer
are
on
the
record
at
page
293
in
the
first
full
paragraph.
the
second
sentence
the
court
said,
“the
only
question
resolved
was
that
of
jurisdiction.”
now,
in
that
sentence
they're
talking
about
the
trial
court,
and
in
the
next
sentence,
“the
trial
court
determined
that
the
act
was
inapplicable
to
employees
of
those
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
judgment
was
based
exclusively
on
that
ground.”
then
further
down
the
page
is
the
strong
approval
of
all
of
the
findings
and
conclusions
to
the
trial
court
saying
that
they
might
well
be
adopted
in
toto
in
the
opinion
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
and
further
saying
that
--
stating
that
the
opinion
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
was
not
exhaustive
on
the
subject
but
just
for
the
sake
of
brevity,
he
wouldn't
say
a
few
of
the
opinions
that
he
considered
controlling.
now,
notwithstanding
that
fact,
there
is
also
in
the
opinion
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
--
beginning
at
page
290
of
the
record.
the
applicable
sections
of
the
aeronautics
act
of
colorado
passed
in
1937
and
the
colorado
supreme
court
itself
without
changing
any
of
that
said,
thus
in
1937,
the
legislature
gave
recognition
to
laws,
to
federal
laws
and
regulations
in
the
realm
of
aeronautics.
and
in
those
particular
statutes,
the
introduction
to
the
navigation
of
aircraft
and
the
license
for
navigation
is
the
recognition
by
the
colorado
state
legislature
that
the
public
safety
requires
and
the
advantages
of
uniform
regulation
made
desirable.
the
federal
control
--
and
the
federal
control
on
these
particular
points
include
qualifications
and
licensing
of
flyers.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
on
what
page
of
the
record?
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
if
they
did
that
that
isn't
an
adequate
state
ground.
as
i
read
that
opinion
and
compare
it
with
the
trial
court's
opinion
and
i
see
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
adoption
of
it
and
the
actual
construction
of
the
trial
court's
opinion
because
they
construe
the
trial
court's
opinion
as
saying
the
act
is
not
applicable.
and
with
that
construction,
and
that
approval,
and
that
adoption,
i
think
that's
the
law
in
colorado
from
the
colorado
supreme
court's
opinion.
therefore,
i
do
believe
that
there
isn't
inadequate
independent
ground.
and
i
think
it's
adequate
and
dependent
as
i
connect
it
with
the
burden
of
preemption
questions.
if
the
statute
is
construed
as
not
applying
then
the
commission
doesn't
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
mr.
justice
white,
many
things
were
argued
below
and
from
the
very
beginning,
those
particular
issues
had
been
argued.
they
along
with
the
others
were
an
important
element
of
the
trial
court's
opinion.
a
lot
of
these
other
items,
these
state
constitutional
questions
and
things
of
that
nature
were
not
with
the
merits
the
question
of
discrimination,
regulations
of
the
commission,
none
of
those
have
ever
been
ruled
on,
but
the
colorado
supreme
court
in
essence,
i
believe,
ruled
on
the
same
grounds
that
the
trial
court
did.
the
only
one
--
the
one
thing
that
it
didn't
mention
in
the
supreme
court
opinion
that
the
trial
court
did
mention
was
a
question
that
we've
had
urged
and
argued,
the
preemption
by
federal
regulation
under
the
government
contract
of
executive
orders.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
i
don't
recall
any
--
they
certainly
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
really
goes
to
those
issues.
i
don't
know
that
mr.
justice
pringle's
does.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
mr.
justice
white,
on
that
i
can
only
say
that
this
other
issues
were
vigorously
argued
and
briefed
and
there
was
a
lot
of
opposition
and
conflict
about
them.
and
that
the
department
of
justice
and
others
intervened
as
amici
in
the
case
in
colorado
so
that
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
perfectly
logical
for
the
court
to
do
what
we
believe
they
did
hold
no
jurisdiction
on
three
bases.
the
statute
doesn't
cover
it
and
burden
on
commerce
and
preemption,
but
obviously
there's
an
argument
on
the
other
side
but
i
think
it's
a
fair
construction
of
the
opinion
of
the
colorado
supreme
court.
now,
i'd
like
to
move,
if
the
court
please,
to
the
issue
of
preemption.
so
the
discussion
has
already
been
had
about
section
404
(b)
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act.
the
language
of
that
particular
provision
of
the
statute
is
sweeping.
also
that
language
in
substance
is
identical
to
sections
31
and
216
(d)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
this
court
has
--
had
the
commerce
act
anti-discrimination
provisions
before
it
in
many
cases,
particularly
the
mitchell
case,
the
henderson
case
and
the
boynton
case.
now,
those
cases
as
you
will
recall
barred
racial
discrimination
among
--
on
passengers
in
interstate
vehicles
and
persons
using
restaurant
facilities
at
a
bus
terminal
that
was
an
integral
part
of
the
transportation
system.
and
in
henderson,
particularly,
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
material
parts
of
section
31
of
the
commerce
act
had
been
in
that
statute
since
1887.
and
from
the
very
beginning,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
recognized
its
application
to
discriminations
between
white
and
negro
passengers.
so
from
the
very
beginning,
it
was
apparently
upheld
by
the
administrative
agency
that
that
anti-discrimination
provision
related
to
matters
of
racial
discrimination.
in
mitchell,
the
court
points
out
that
there
was
no
intent
by
the
congress
to
exempt
any
discrimination
from
the
coverage
of
the
act.
now,
following
the
lead
of
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
1956
ruled
in
the
ella
fitzgerald
case
against
pan
american.
it
there
held
that
404
(b)
prohibits
discrimination
against
persons
including
passengers
and
that
although
agencies
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
yes,
your
honor.
it
--
where
we
have
the
mitchell
and
henderson
and
boynton
cases.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
page
44.
i
believe
we
set
forth
the
statute
to
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
the
identity
of
a
language
is
--
is
i
think
unquestionable,
but
the
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
it
was
reenacted
in
the
1958
act.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
it's
verbatim.
i
know
of
no
changes.
now,
the
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
i
don't
know
whether
it
has
or
not,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
know
of
no
case
where
it
has
been
applied
to
an
employee.
however,
in
the
civil
aviation
act,
the
word
“person”,
this
discrimination
relates
to
a
person
and
the
definition
of
the
word
“person,”
it
just
says
it
means
an
individual.
so
that
it's
in
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
yes,
i
have,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
and
i
think
that
there's
other
federal
legislation
too,
but
on
this
particular
point,
i
am
taking
that
position.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
yes
on
that
basis
and
the
broad
statutory
scheme.
there's
an
agency
procedure
and
what's
more,
this
particular
agency
also
has
some
expertise
in
light
proof
qualifications.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
they
--
when
the
civil
aeronautics
act
was
passed
in
1938,
no
action
was
taken.
i
don't
believe
until
1961
by
the
board
in
relation
--
of
race
relations
matters.
but
beginning
in
1961,
when
--
and
1962
when
the
board
under
section
1007
of
the
act
requested
the
attorney
general
to
proceed
with
the
terminals
in
montgomery
and
birmingham,
the
three
or
fourth
--
the
actions
were
brought
under
404
of
the
act.
now,
the
argument
certainly
can
be
made
as
far
as
i
know
that
nobody
in
mr.
green's
position
or
a
comparable
position
to
that
has
ever
taken
a
case
of
this
kind
of
civil
aeronautics
board.
i
haven't
seen
that
happen.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do.
and
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
the
agency
proceeding
in
the
first
instance
would
be
to
file
a
complaint
under
1002
(a)
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act
with
the
civil
aeronautics
board
and
assert
violation
of
the
act
under
404
(b).
under
1002
(c)
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act,
the
board
has
power
to
issue
an
order
to
compel
compliance
with
the
act.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
he
also
has
some
court
remedies.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
even
under
the
cab,
under
the
fitzgerald
case.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
fitzgerald
was
a
404
(b)
case
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
--
and
it
was
a
damage
suit
and
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
a
passenger,
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
brought
into
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
that's
correct,
your
honor
and
in
that
particular
case,
pan
american
airways
moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
saying
there
was
no
diversity
of
citizenship
and
no
federal
question
because
they
said
it
was
a
simple
contract
question.
but
the
court
overruled
pan
american
on
that
point
and
said
this
is
a
federal
law
question,
it's
under
404
(b).
404
(b)
covered
persons
including
passengers
and
there
was
a
ruling
of
the
court.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
oh,
i
think
it
would
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it
would
and
i
think
that
the
provision
of
404
(b)
is
about
as
broad
as
it
can
be.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
immediately
before
the
recess,
you
asked
me
to
address
myself
to
some
comments
of
mrs.
siegel.
mrs.
siegel
pointed
out
that
the
new
york
commission
had
dealt,
first
of
all,
with
many
railroads
and
that
is
involving
railroad
employee.
on
this
particular
point,
it
is
pointed
out
on
page
21
of
our
brief
that
there
is
a
vast
difference
in
the
intensity
of
regulation
of
railroad
employees
and
persons
like
flight
crew
personnel
on
interstate
airlines.
and
the
federal
government
doesn't
even
provide
a
license
for
a
railroad
engineer
or
truck
or
bus
driver,
but
obviously
there's
a
vast
degree
of
licensing,
certification,
checking,
re-examining,
things
of
that
nature
in
regard
to
pilots.
next,
she
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
mr.
chief
justice,
on
that
point,
when
we
get
to
the
quest
--
in
the
question
of
preemption,
there
is
not
only
the
subject
of
federal
law
coverage,
but
the
next
step
bridged
the
gap
whether
it
has
to
be
exclusive.
i
do
believe
that
between
different
classes
of
employees,
there
may
be
different
degrees
of
federal
regulation
and
the
hostess
and
the
pilot
do
present
an
example
of
that.
hostesses
for
example
are
not
subject
as
pilots
are
under
section
609
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act,
to
constant
examination
and
reexamination
and
proficiency
checks
and
qualification
judgments
by
federal
agencies.
and
there,
for
example,
might
be
a
difference
in
an
expression
of
a
congressional
intent
and
for
that
reason,
i
really
--
i
say
this.
i
say
that
the
substantive
coverage
of
federal
law
as
embodied
in
404
(b)
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act
is
sweeping
and
broad.
i
think
with
respect
to
flight
crew
members
and
pilots
particularly,
and
the
hostess
is
not
a
flight
crew
member.
she
rides
on
an
airplane,
but
a
flight
crew
member
is
defined
in
the
civil
aeronautics
regulation
as
including
pilots
and
flight
engineers.
this
is
a
particular
--
a
particular
group,
but
the
evidence
of
an
intent
of
congress
to
establish
in
exclusivity,
exclusive
regulation
with
respect
to
pilots,
i
believe
is
much
clear
than
with
respect
to
any
other
position
on
an
aircraft.
next,
mrs.
siegel
also
pointed
out
that
there
had
been
conciliation
and
persuasion
in
the
relationship
between
the
new
york
commission
and
various
airlines,
and
pointed
particularly
to
the
hostess
on
mobile.
but
i
think
it's
also
true
that
she
indicated
to
this
court
that
these
airlines
had
not
gone
to
the
court
and
i
don't
believe
that
she
or
i
or
anyone
else
knows
of
any
court
case
which
has
upheld
an
order
of
a
state
anti-discrimination
requiring
affirmatively
an
airline
to
hire
a
pilot.
i
don't
believe
that
such
a
decision
exists.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
--
i
do
not
know
of
anything
in
the
legislative
history
on
404
(b).
i
do
know
what
this
court
has
held
about
3
(1)
and
216
(d)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
what
this
court
considered
the
intent
of
congress
to
be
and
that
is
they
considered
that
no
discrimination
was
exempted,
no
discrimination
was
exempted
and
i
think
that's
critical
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
i
do
not
believe
there
is,
justice
goldberg.
if
there
is,
i
don't
know
of
it.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
i
don't
know
of
it,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
haven't
looked
at
it
recently.
i
don't
recall
the
details
of
it.
i
--
i
argue
my
position
from
the
parallel
of
practically
identical
statutes
and
these
other
expressions
by
this
court.
now
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
i
believe
that
we
are,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
this
was
argued
in
the
court
below.
we
did
not
present
that
question
for
review
before
this
court.
the
justice
department
contended
that
we
weren't
because
we
didn't
have
a
written
contract
to
carry
mail.
my
view
on
it,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
contract
is
written
or
not,
we
are
required
to
carry
it
by
statute
and
we're
required
to
be
compensated
for
the
service
by
statute
in
effect
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
by
the
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
by
the
united
states
government.
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
i
would
call
it
a
statutory
contract.
it's
embodied
in
the
law
itself.
you're
required
to
carry
it
in
the
fees
prescribed
i
think
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
that's
correct,
constantly,
on
all
aircraft.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
no,
mr.
justice
clark,
there
is
a
mail
pay
subsidy
but
that
is
different
from
just
a
straight
fee
for
compensation
for
mail.
and
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
it
depends
on
the
airline.
i
think
the
smaller
feeders
may
still
have
mail
pay
subsidies.
continental
is
a
small
trunk.
it
doesn't
have
a
mail
pay
subsidy
but
it
is
compensated
for
carrying
mail.
i
think
that
--
i
want
to
touch
briefly
also
on
the
subject
of
the
railway
labor
act.
and
i
particularly
want
to
touch
on
that
because
i
believe
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
followed
it
also
provide
federal
substantive
law
coverage.
the
subjects
covered
in
the
railway
labor
act,
they're
not
only
collective
bargaining,
normal
labor
relations
problems,
but
the
general
area
is
described
as
rates
to
pay
rules
in
working
conditions,
that
must
be
kept
in
mind
because
we
all
know
the
broad
inclusive
character
of
that
phrase.
now,
the
very
--
the
colorado
act
that
we're
dealing
with
here
doesn't
go
just
to
the
subject
of
hiring.
it
goes
beyond
hiring
and
it
goes
throughout
the
whole
ambit
of
the
employer-employee
relationship.
and
that
it
covers
hiring,
promotion,
demotion,
discharge,
compensation,
all
of
which
fall,
i
submit,
within
the
clear
meaning
of
rates,
payrolls
and
working
conditions.
now,
in
howard,
this
court
on
remand
to
the
district
court
ordered
that
the
employer,
the
railroad
as
well
as
the
union
be
enjoined
for
--
from
participating
with
the
union
in
racial
discrimination
against
negro
employees
who
were
represented
by
still
a
second
union.
then,
there
are
two
fifth
circuit
cases
that
follow
howard,
one
of
which
is
the
central
georgia
railroad,
decided
1956
in
229
f.2d
and
cert
was
denied
by
this
court
in
352
u.s.
there
again,
the
court
of
appeals
barred
an
employer
from
discriminating
in
concert
with
a
union
and
it
held
the
employer
liable.
now
that
case
--
the
district
court's
order
which
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
which
was
discussed
at
great
length
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
held
the
employer
liable
in
damages
to
the
negro
employees
against
whom
this
discriminated
--
discrimination
have
been
exercised.
and
also
ordered
an
affirmative
injunction
to
open
up
the
jobs
to
the
employees
against
whom
the
discrimination
had
been
practiced.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
railway
labor
act
case
following
howard.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
have
absolutely
none.
and
i
say
that
in
principle
and
i
don't
think
it
can
really
seriously
be
argued
here,
one
cannot
say
that
a
railway
laborer
act
employer
can't
discriminate
against
employees
in
concert
with
the
union,
but
can
discriminate
against
such
employees
unilaterally.
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
fit
the
logic
of
the
howard
rule,
the
logic
of
it.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
that
point
and
in
a
case
immediately
following
the
central
of
georgia
by
the
same
circuit;
it's
richardson
against
the
texas
and
new
orleans
railroad
in
242
f.2d.
in
that
particular
case,
the
court
analyzed
the
reason
for
the
rule.
they
said
that
you
have
to
read
the
contract
as
if
the
illegal
clause
isn't
in
it.
and
it
says
then,
the
employer
is
the
one
who
is
discriminating.
and
then
it
went
a
little
bit
further
and
said
that
it
would
be
absolutely
impossible
to
enforce
the
howard
rule
unless
a
commensurate
duty
were
placed
upon
the
employer
and
i
think
that's
correct.
the
rationale
behind
it
is
that
a
railway
labor
act
employer,
an
airline
or
a
railroad
or
whoever
it
may
be
is
a
federally
sponsored
industry
and
it
exists
by
virtue
of
its
certification.
it
exists
and
operates
under
a
multitude
of
detailed
federal
regulation
and
of
--
an
employer
in
that
sense
acts
as
an
instrumentality
of
the
government
and
can't
engage
in
such
discrimination.
however,
that's
my
view
of
it
and
i
think
that
even
the
railway
labor
act
--
there
are
more
examples.
railway
labor
act
provides
for
settlement
of
grievances
by
binding
arbitration,
by
a
system
board
of
adjustments
in
the
case
of
airlines.
all
the
questions
relating
to
promotion
or
demotion
or
discharge
or
any
implementation,
their
application
of
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
example
are
covered
under
the
grievance
procedure.
now
these
are
the
very
same
acts
--
incidents
of
the
employment
relationship
that
purports
to
be
covered
by
the
colorado
law.
but
to
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
a
grievance
could
be
filed
by
an
employer
against
an
employee,
a
kind
of
discrimination,
i
promote
one
and
not
the
other
be
could
grieve.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
i
think
their
prospective
employee
would
not
be
covered
by
the
grievance
procedure.
the
prospective
employee
would
be
covered
by
the
civil
actions
permitted
in
the
central
of
georgia
and
the
richardson
against
the
railroad
imposing
clearly
the
duty
on
the
employer,
even
the
affirmative
injunction
to
open
up
the
jobs
to
employees
in
the
central
of
georgia
case.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
under
the
railway
labor
act
following
the
howard
rule
with
an
employer
operating
under
federal
sponsorship
and
it
has
reference
in
regulation
of
the
government.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
i
would
think,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
that
particular
thing,
this
court
would
require
such
an
action
to
be
brought
under
the
railway
labor
act,
because
of
the
specific
relationship
to
unions
and
union
organization
in
collective
bargaining
in
the
railway
labor
act.
and
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
appropriate
--
the
appropriate
act
to
apply
in
that
case,
but
i'll
contend
further
and
i
believe
it's
true
that
the
railway
labor
act
does
not
only
start
becoming
operative
after
a
man
has
been
employed.
it
actually
has
some
specific
pre-employment
provisions.
one
is
the
prohibition
on
the
yellow-dog
contract.
the
other
is
the
situation
that
you
just
alluded
to
and
that
would
be
any
union
discrimination
in
employment.
then
labor
contracts
can
require
an
employer
to
hire
more
employees
rather
than
contract
out
work.
in
other
words,
my
theory
is
that
the
impact
of
the
railway
labor
act,
developing
substantive
federal
law
coverage
of
the
type
of
discrimination
complained
of
in
this
case,
that
we
have
large
bodies
of
federal
law
that
actually
cover
the
subject.
and
then
you
move
from
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
i
think
that's
entirely
right,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
i
certainly
think
that
those
cases
are
terribly
important
and
very
persuasive
there.
and
i
think
that
alluding
to
mrs.
siegel's
remarks
about
the
new
york
commission.
this
same
thing
came
before
this
court
in
the
bethlehem
steel
against
the
new
york
labor
board.
new
york
had
the
little
wagner
act.
this
court
has
pointed
out
that
the
laws
were
compatible
but
the
procedures
were
different.
in
garner
against
teamsters,
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
laws
were
compatible,
but
the
procedures
are
different.
with
the
multiplicity
of
tribunals
and
the
diverse
procedures,
inconsistent
and
conflicting
results
occur
just
as
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
that
is
my
argument,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
that
we
are
dealing
with
this
industry
that
escapes
the
bounds
of
local
regulative
confidence,
the
minute
the
airplane
takes
off.
i
think
that
uniformity
of
regulation
is
necessary.
i
do
not
think
diversity
of
regulation
can
be
permitted.
i
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
mr.
justice
white,
i
will
agree
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
case
of
brown
against
board
of
education,
so
no
state
could
enact
a
legal
segregation
law
today
whether
relating
to
schools
or
employment
or
anything
of
that
nature.
and
if
the
colorado
act
were
that
way,
i'm
quite
sure
that
the
petitioner
would
be
asserting
this
pervasive
federal
regulation
and
preemption.
however,
the
colorado
law
is
not
that
way
and
we
can
assume
that
the
policies
and
purposes
of
the
federal
laws
and
all
of
the
state
laws
are
the
same.
they're
anti-discrimination
laws
and
the
policy
is
anti-discrimination,
but
identity
of
policy
and
identity
of
purpose
doesn't
mean
that
the
same
results
are
going
to
be
reached.
if
you
have
an
anti-discrimination
case,
you
have
a
case
where
a
commission
or
a
court
is
going
to
have
to
weigh
the
facts
and
make
the
decision,
use
its
judgment,
use
its
discretion
in
areas
of
that
kind
with
all
of
the
different
tribunals
that
would
be
available,
different
results
would
occur.
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
i
think
we
bridge
the
gap
between
substantive
federal
law
coverage
and
preemption.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
this
is
particularly
true
in
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court
on
this
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
i
do
believe
that
it's
quite
interesting
in
those
cases.
they
do
permit
because
of
this
court's
view
of
the
meaning
of
section
301
of
the
act
that
an
employee
alleging
breach
of
contract
which
also
happens
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
can
go
into
the
federal
court
or
state
court
to
do
it.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
but
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
the
comparable
situation
--
i
think
if
you
follow
the
lucas
flour
case
and
the
dowd
case
and
--
and
dowd,
what
that
would
mean
is
that
an
employee
claiming
discrimination
could
sue
in
the
state
court
for
violation
of
404
(b)
or
the
railway
labor
act.
he
couldn't
sue
in
the
state
court
for
violation
of
the
state
anti-discrimination
act.
this
is
the
way
i
understand
the
evening
news
and
those
cases
because
those
cases
specifically
provide
that
even
though
the
suit's
brought
in
state
court
you're
talking
about
a
body
of
federal
labor
law
and
we
say
that
the
federal
law
on
this
subject
must
occur
if
it's
not
different.
airlines
will
be
treated
differently
just
depending
on
where
they
happen
to
have
their
employment
office
or
one
airline
might
be
treated
differently
from
state
to
state.
we
think
that
the
federal
regulation
is
so
pervasive
that
it
indicates
the
congressional
intent
to
have
uniform
application
in
relation
to
discrimination
against
pilots
and
this
is
the
way
we
bridge
the
gap.
the
examples
are
many
fold.
this
court
has
found
that
in
the
campbell
against
husky
case,
the
tobacco
case,
this
court
has
found
that
in
the
pennsylvania
nelson
case
that
mr.
justice
harlan
mentioned.
now
there,
there
was
a
particular
national
interest
and
compatible
state
and
federal
policy.
we
say
the
same
thing
is
true
here.
the
congressional
legislation,
the
pervasiveness
--
the
pervasiveness
of
the
regulation,
and
particularly
regulation
of
pilots
which
goes
right
down
to
checking
and
reexamination
and
everything
of
that
nature
spelled
out
in
the
statute
and
the
regulation.
we
have
compatible
policies
against
discrimination
and
if
it
is
permitted
here,
if
20
or
25
states
are
permitted
to
rule
on
this
subject
by
all
50
can
and
with
that
number
of
tribunals
and
an
equal
number
of
diverse
procedures,
i
think
it's
the
rule
of
--
the
intent
or
court
order,
the
decisions
of
this
court.
that
the
same
kind
of
inconsistent
and
conflicting
results
can
be
reached
as
if
there
were
an
actual
substantive
conflict
in
the
laws.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
have
any
what,
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
as
far
as
i
know
this
is
the
first
case
involving
a
state
commission's
order
being
enforced
in
a
court
to
hire
a
pilot.
but
i
think
--
i
think
the
language
of
the
court
in
--
maybe
it
was
bethlehem
steel
or
else
it
was
garner
where
they
said,
“we
don't
want
to
go
on
a
case
by
case
basis
just
to
test
federal
supremacy
that
way.”
the
laws,
the
policies
were
substantively
compatible.
the
procedures
were
different
and
the
court
said
preemption
occurred.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
i
really
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
yes,
i
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
in
policy.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
oh,
i
believe
there
is,
your
honor.mr.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
we
just
have
one
case
and
this
is
the
first
case
of
this
kind
that
i
know
of
but
the
fact
that
the
law
has
provided
inconsistent
procedures
are
here.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
that's
certainly
true
as
between
state
and
federal
but
throughout
the
united
states
where
all
of
the
anti-discrimination
laws
exist
as
a
different
procedure
and
state
after
state,
after
state.
some
cases,
private
individuals
can
--
bring
complaints
and
others,
only
the
attorney
general
can.
in
colorado
we
got
the
private
individual,
the
attorney
general,
the
commission
and
the
commissioner.
we've
got
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
this
fits
the
preemption
argument
and
the
case
of
california
against
zook
was
mentioned
and
the
huron
cement
case
in
detroit
was
also
mentioned.
in
the
california
case
the
california
law
was
upheld
and
in
the
huron
case,
the
detroit
law
was
upheld,
but
in
both
of
those
cases
it
was
pointed
out
that
--
i
think
in
the
detroit
case,
there
was
no
mention
whatsoever
of
any
other
local
law
that
might
conflict
in
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
there
was
no
evidence
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
then
in
the
zook
case
there
were
just
two
comparable
local
laws
and
i
believe
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
there
indicates
that
the
decision
of
this
court
might
have
been
different
if
there
had
been
a
multitude
of
state
laws.
and
so,
i
do
believe
that
the
multitude
of
state
laws
and
the
diversity
of
state
laws
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
would
prevent,
prevent
uniform
application
of
federal
law,
either
presumed
intent
of
congress
or
actual
intent
of
congress,
i
think
that
when
you
compare
the
civil
aeronautics
act
and
the
railway
labor
act,
the
civil
aeronautics
act
there
is
much
more
specific
and
sweeping
on
a
--
as
an
anti-discrimination
provision.
but
i
think
the
railway
labor
act
has
been
construed
and
properly
construed
that
an
employer
sponsored
by
the
federal
government
cannot
participate
in
racial
discrimination.
and
it
is
true
that
the
pervasiveness
of
the
regulation,
what
i
say
is
the
need
for
uniformity
which
is
accented
by
the
multitude
of
tribunals
gives
rise
to
my
argument
that
there
is
preemption
here.
i
think
the
same
thing
is
--
it
follows
on
the
burden
argument
that
we
make.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
i
think
the
congressional
design,
i
--
i'll
certainly
agree,
mr.
justice
brennan
it
was
more
specific
there
but
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
and
there's
that
multitude
of
the
labor
cases.
the
garner
involved
the
pennsylvania
law
and
the
bethlehem
steel
involved
the
new
york
law
and
the
goss
involved
the
utah
law
and
there
was
a
forerunner
to
goss.
i
forgot
--
forgotten
the
style
of
it
right
now,
but
in
garmin
the
prohibition
bringing
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
in
a
state
court
and
all
of
those
laws
were
compatible.
the
new
york
law
was
called
the
little
wagner
act
and
there's
just
preemption
there
because
you
got
to
have
--
and
i
think
it
also
should
be
--
i
should
emphasize
that
there
--
the
congressional
regulation
indicates
a
tremendous,
intensive
national
interest,
federal
interest
in
aviation,
in
aviation
operations,
not
only
as
respective
crew
members
but
all
of
the
other
safety
questions,
the
use
of
airways,
traffic
control,
you
can't
operate
the
aircraft
without
federally
certificated
personnel
according
to
federal
commands
and
directions.
i
think
that
industry
is
a
national
industry.
i
don't
think
it
can
be
localized.
i
don't
think
that
any
airline
should
be
subject
to
varying
infringement
of
state
laws.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
the
cases
that
i
referred
the
court
to
earlier,
the
mitchell
case
and
the
henderson
case
are
the
ones
that
this
court
--
when
this
court
had
before
it
the
identical
portions
of
the
commerce
act
and
it
was
this
court's
decision
referring
to
the
identical
portions
of
the
commerce
act
that
if
concluded
--
this
court
concluded
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
exempt
any
discrimination.
furthermore,
the
icc
has
been
aware
since
1887
that
that
clause
did
apply
to
this
race
relation
question
that
is
desegregation
of
white
and
negro
passengers.
so
that
even
--
back
on
those
earlier
cases,
this
court
has
concluded
that
this
identical
federal
statutory
language
did
have
that
purpose
and
the
broad
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
no,
i
don't
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
my
response
to
those
remarks
is
that
the
language
of
the
act,
employer
discrimination
against
any
person
in
any
respect
whatsoever,
the
broadest
language
possible,
the
word
person
is
defined.
the
fitzgerald
case
didn't
limit
it's
holding
to
passengers
in
reading
the
act,
it
said
it
prohibits
discrimination
against
persons
and
then
including
passengers.
the
idea
was
that
it
didn't
intend
by
that
construction
to
limit
it
simply
to
passengers.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
i
certainly
think
that
it
--
i
know
that
it's
used
in
relation
to
service
and
this
court
has
just
heard
this
icc
case
which
relates
to
discriminatory
rates
and
certainly
are
applicable
to
that.
but
this
court
itself
had
--
has
held
it
applicable
not
only,
really
to
questions
of
actual
service
by
the
character
but
the
terminal
restaurants
and
so
on
operated
by
independent
contractors.
the
cab
itself
has
a
--
and
asked
and
requested
the
attorney
general
to
bring
these
suits
down
in
montgomery
and
birmingham
and
alabama
and
they
relate
to
all
terminal
facilities.
the
scope
of
it
in
relation
to
race
relations
i
think
is
as
broad
as
it
can
be.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
i'd
say
it
remained
dorman
--
dormant
for
about
22
years
and
then
they
started
to
use
it.
of
course
the
federal
government
started
to
use
it.
actually,
the
fitzgerald
case
in
--
is
in
1956
and
so
that's
18
years
after
the
statute
was
passed,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
means
--
i
don't
think
the
rule
is
--
that
just
a
period
of
dormant
excludes
the
question
of
preemption.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
the
court
here
held
that
the
commerce
act
--
that
the
commerce
commission
recognized
immediately
from
the
beginning,
i
think
the
words
were,
that
it
covered
discrimination
against
--
in
relation
to
segregation
of
white
and
negro
passengers
so
that
it
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
yes,
start
from
beginning.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
1886,
it's
when
it's
passed.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
i
think
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
but
i
do
not
think
that
it's
possible
under
the
language
of
the
act
to
make
a
distinction
between
a
passenger
and
a
pilot
or
a
passenger
and
employee.
i
think
the
definition
covers
it.
i
think
that
the
understanding
of
the
court
in
fitzgerald,
it
was
persons
the
act
was
talking
about
and
not
just
passengers.
it
wouldn't
make
sense
just
to
limit
it
to
passengers
to
permit
air
carriers
to
discriminate
against
all
kinds
of
persons
just
because
they
weren't
passengers,
whatever
the
reason
might
be.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
i
have
no
idea,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
have
no
idea
whatsoever.
i'm
sure
that
we
at
continental
air
lines
were
faced
with
the
new
field
when
this
case
came
up
and
we've
been
working
on
it
rather
steadily
for
several
years
now,
and
this
is
our
conclusion
as
to
what
the
law
is.
i
would
like
to
go
one
step
further
with
the
point
that
you're
making,
your
honor.
there
have
been
many
cases
where
agency's
activities
and
powers
have
remained
dormant.
i
think
an
interesting
case
in
this
field
is
boynton.
that
was
the
one
where
the
bus
terminal
was
an
integral
part
of
the
bus
transportation
system.
the
restaurant
in
the
terminal
was
operated
by
a
lessee,
an
independent
contractor
not
operated
by
the
trailways
bus
company.
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
took
the
view
that
that
they
didn't
think
they
had
the
authority.
they
disclaimed
authority
to
regulate
these
lessee
restaurant
operators.
but
this
court
held
that
that
was
a
violation
of
the
act
and
within
a
year
after
this
court's
decision,
the
icc
then
adopted
a
new
set
of
regulations
specifically
to
cover
it.
so
here
was
an
area
of
dormancy
for
many
years.
the
administrative
agency
was
told
by
this
court
that
by
gosh!
this
is
within
the
scope
of
your
authority
and
they
passed
the
--
adopted
the
regulation
and
implemented
it.
in
the
very
recent
case
decided
by
this
court,
the
pan
american-grace
case.
i
believe
there
the
cab
disclaimed
authority
on
the
particular
issue
before
the
court.
but
if
the
court
--
where
the
court
concluded
that
this
was
specifically
within
the
authority
of
the
cab,
the
dormant
exercise
of
that
authority
was
of
no
moment.
so,
i
don't
really
think
that
the
question
of
dormancy
should
change
the
issue
when
this
changed
the
result
of
this
case.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
i
do
that
for
this
reason,
mr.
justice
brennan.
one
is
both
decisions
below
are
limited
to
flight
crew
personnel
and
that
is
the
issue
that
stayed
in
the
supreme
court's
opinion,
that
is
the
decision
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
that's
all
i
need
to
prevail
on
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
i
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
i
think
that
your
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
an
interesting
question.
i
think
that
what
will
have
to
be
decided,
i'm
sure
that
there's
substantive
federal
law
coverage
with
respect
to
those
people
because
of
the
way
i
construe
the
act.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
the
question
is
whether
with
respect
to
those
employees,
you
can
bridge
the
gap
of
just
federal
law
coverage
and
actual
preemption.
is
there
a
need
for
uniformity
of
a
regulation
with
respect
to
unlicensed
people
who
aren't
necessarily
required
to
have
the
high
degree
of
qualification?
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
no.
some
mechanics
or
licenses
and
some
and
some
aren't.
you
start
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
and
you
might
have
an
unlicensed
man.
you
move
up
to
your
senior
mechanics
and
lead
men
then
you
have
any
licenses
and
things
of
that
nature.
there
may
be
--
you
can
--
you
could
make
an
argument
perhaps
on
any
particular
employee
as
to
what
was
the
degree
of
his
national
contacts.
what
is
the
incidence
of
his
relationship
with
the
federal
government
in
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
mr.
justice
white,
sorry.
i
do
have
some
familiarity
with
the
labor
laws
and
i
think
that
from
my
experience
as
a
labor
lawyer,
it
has
been
that
we
always
examined
whatever
law
has
really
covered
the
subject
and
how
they
would
dispose
of
the
problem
but
my
experience
also
as
a
labor
lawyer
has
indicated
to
me
that
99
times
out
of
a
hundred,
the
law
that's
applicable
is
the
federal
law.
it's
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
the
railway
labor
act
or
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
it's
the
federal
law
that
occupies
this
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
know
of
the
situation.
i
haven't
run
into
that.
i
have
run
into
the
instances
under
14
(b)
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
where
there
are
more
limitations
in
state
laws
on
union
security
problem.
but
i
don't
know
of
particular
cases
where
there's
a
line
in
any
particular
organization
of
state
laws
covering
rather
than
federal
law.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
it's
really
very
difficult
i
think
to
give
a
categorical
answer
to
that.
i
think
the
federal
law
coverage
is
there
as
to
all
airline
industry,
where
the
line
on
preemption
would
be
drawn,
i
really
don't
know.
i
think
it
would
take
a
careful
study
of
the
facts
of
that
particular
case
but
i
just
cannot
see
how
a
relationship
between
an
airline
and
a
pilot,
the
man
who
is
flying
the
plane
and
moving
from
state
to
state,
and
airlines
that
cover
all
states
can
be
subject
to
inconsistent
varying
conflicting
regulation.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
pilots
that
we
have
do
have
federal
licenses.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
the
actual
language
of
the
act
permits
the
cab
to
issue
such
appropriate
orders
maybe
necessary
to
compel
compliance
with
the
act.
now
what
the
--
i
think
the
normal
scope
of
an
order
in
the
first
instance
would
be
an
order
such
as
the
one
entered
by
the
discrimination
commission
here,
hire
that
man,
promote
that
man,
or
don't,
whichever
is
required
depending
on
the
--
whether
they
could
go
further
than
that
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
sure.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
unless
there
are
some
other
legal
problems
that
i
can't
put
my
hands
on
right
now,
i
think
an
order
such
as
you
suggest
after
proper
notice
and
hearing
and
subject
to
judicial
review
and
everything
of
that
nature
is
within
the
scope
of
that
1002
description,
that
description
of
the
type
of
orders
that
could
be
issued.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
perhaps,
it
maybe
some
other
issue
like
that
--
i
don't
know
but
the
breadth
of
it
is
the
scope
of
the
language
is
very
great
and
i
argue
that
this
is
the
way
it
should
be.
we
are
regulated
by
the
federal
government
from
top
to
bottom
and
we
deal
with
the
agencies
regularly,
their
control
or
familiar
with
their
procedures.
they
would
establish
uniform
rules
there
and
uniform
practices
just
like
they
have
on
all
of
the
other
matters.
these,
the
agencies
that
are
familiar
with
airlines,
with
pilot
qualifications,
with
issues
such
as
could
come
up
in
a
case
before
them.
the
likelihood
of
uniform
result
is
so
much
more
great
in
the
case
of
preemption
than
use
of
the
federal
agencies
than
it
is
by
use
of
multiple
state
agencies
that
i
think
it's
very
significant.
the
only
other
area
that
i
really
haven't
touched
on
in
any
detail
is
the
question
of
burden.
this
is
another
part
of
their
argument.
the
colorado
supreme
court
relied
on
the
morgan
case
and
the
old
hall
case,
hall
against
decuir.
i
think
that
those
cases
stand
for
the
proposition
that
where
uniformity
is
necessary
as
we
contend
it
is,
the
state
laws
cannot
move
in
to
that
field
of
commerce
because
of
--
this
isn't
the
area
that
permits
the
diverse
regulation.
now,
everything
i've
said
about
the
need
for
uniformity
in
connection
with
my
argument
on
preemption
goes
right
to
the
same
need
for
uniformity
and
the
argument
on
burden.
i
don't
think
that
hall
can
just
be
dismissed
because
brown
avoided
it
against
board
of
education.
hall
still
expresses
the
same
rule
if
that
happened
to
be
the
reconstruction
act
in
louisiana
that
required
comingling
of
passengers
on
riverboats
in
that
state.
morgan
was
the
later
--
the
virginia
segregation
statute,
both
of
them
have
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
an
--
as
an
unconstitutional
burdens
on
commerce.
the
point
has
been
made
that
this
evidence
is
--
the
evidence
in
this
case,
the
record
does
not
show
the
type
of
burden
that
was
spent
on,
say
in
southern
pacific
against
arizona
and
bibb
against
navajo
freight
lines
and
an
actual
impediment
involving
a
great
deal
of
cost.
i
think
the
court
should
also
recall
the
morgan
decision,
that
isn't
the
kind
of
burden
that
was
found
there.
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
passengers
had
to
order
their
movements
on
interstate
travel.
there
is
no
great
impediment
to
the
flow
of
travel
there.
the
discrimination
certainly
was
unlawful
but
it
was
a
burden
on
commerce.
it
wasn't
another
fourteenth
amendment
case.
i
also
want
to
point
out
that
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
need
for
any
more
evidence
on
burden.
earlier
in
my
argument
this
morning,
i
did
allude
--
i
did
start
discussing
the
fact
that
the
colorado
commission
did
make
a
determination
of
green's
qualification.
it
made
that
determination
that
he
was
qualified,
therefore
the
only
discrimination
is
on
account
of
race,
but
that
is
inherent
in
the
colorado
act.
a
decision
by
the
commission
on
qualifications
has
to
be
made.
i
think
that
really
is
all
that
need
be
said
about.
i
do
not
think
it
is
possible
to
permit
28-30
commissions
around
the
state
with
persons
unskilled
in
matters
of
aviation
to
determine
qualifications
of
pilots.
just
for
the
sake
of
argument
suppose
the
facts
in
this
case
were
a
little
bit
different,
suppose
mr.
green
instead
of
having
3000
hours
had
had
1000
hours.
could
they
then
still
determine
qualification?
all
of
the
things
that
go
into
determination
of
qualification
of
pilots
we
think
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
mr.
chief
justice,
they
did
in
part
and
then
they
dismissed
our
conflicting
judgment
which
arose
at
the
time
of
the
publicity
that
occurred.
at
that
time
continental
had
first
decided
that
green
was
qualified.
at
the
later
date
when
the
wide
publicity
occurred
was
when
continental
took
the
position
that
he
was
therefore
not
qualified.
now,
so
they
made
the
decision
in
conflict
with
our
judgment,
the
judgment
is
the
judgment
that
was
exercised
in
early
august
of
1957.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
what
the
record
in
the
case
shows
is
that
the
company
felt
that
this
would
cause
a
lot
of
notoriety
and
that
it
could
interfere
with
his
training.
now
that's
what
it
showed
but
if
--
they
also
--
they
--
no,
the
testimony
also
shows
that
other
pilots
had
been
discharged
from
becoming
involved
in
controversial
public
things
and
this
was
their
view
that
they
wanted
someone
that
was
less
in
the
public
eye,
quieter
type
of
person
but
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well,
at
that
particular
time,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
he
already
had
been
admitted
to
the
first
trade
of
course,
he
was
told
that
he
was
eligible
and
his
name
was
held
with
the
other
eligible
pilots
for
subject
on
employment.
and
this
appears
in
the
record
and
this
is
in
telephone
conversation
between
mr.
green
and
mr.
bell.
my
view
on
the
burden
argument
is
that
the
diverse
state
regulation
involving
these
issues
that
can
only
be
decided
by
an
exercise
of
judgment
in
discretion
of
course
is
the
burden.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that's
determined,
but
that's
determined
under
an
act.
that
doesn't
provide
blanket
discrimination.
it
doesn't
--
isn't
a
blanket
anti-discrimination.
it
only
prohibits
an
employer
from
discriminating
persons
otherwise
qualified.
so,
this
is
the
statute
that
we're
dealing
with.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
but
you
can
also
acknowledge
that
the
act
does
require
the
commission
to
make
a
determination
of
qualification
because
they
couldn't
make
the
second
decision
unless
they
first
made
the
first
decision.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
my
feeling
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
my
feeling
on
that
is
this
that
the
initial
--
that
the
judgment
on
--
whether
to
hire
or
not
to
hire,
qualifications
things
of
that
kind
must
first
reside
with
the
carrier.
there's
where
the
responsibility
is.
that's
the
organization
that
performs
the
interstate
transportation,
it
is
the
one
that
runs
the
risks,
makes
the
games,
things
of
that
nature.
but
if
its
judgment
is
going
to
be
limited,
it
must
be
limited
according
to
the
intent
of
congress
and
by
one
single
federal
agency,
a
single
authority
prescribing
uniform
regulations.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
we
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
no.
no,
it's
identical.
and
the
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
right,
they
are
the
policies.
they're
completely
compatible,
just
completely
compatible.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
identical.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
and
they
are
both
strong,
they're
both
vigorous.
the
federal
policy
is
strong
and
it's
vigorous.
the
state
policy
is
strong
and
it's
vigorous.
this
is
true
but
we
--
but
then
we're
dealing
with
this
high
speed
transportation
industry
with
commissions
all
over,
and
officials
all
over,
90
more
commissions,
some
of
them
are
board
of
education
commissioner,
or
things
of
that
nature
and
i
do
believe
that
these
airlines,
so
regulated
from
top
to
bottom
must
be
regulated
in
this
field
also
by
the
federal
government.
i
think
that
a
decision
by
a
state
commission
in
conflict
with
the
carrier's
judgment
that
an
employee
is
qualified
is
a
direct
intrusion
into
something
that
is
very
national
in
character
and
must
be
regulated.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
and
if
it
does
differ
with
our
judgment,
it
is
the
board
that
has
the
expertise
relating
to
pilot
qualifications.
it's
obligated.
the
case
is
now
brief
--
pointed
out.
the
609
cases,
the
cab
examines
and
reexamines
qualifications
part,
there's
the
expertise.
the
same
thing
is
true
in
our
grievance
cases,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
if
you
have
a
pilot
discharge
case.
you
got
your
system
board
of
adjustment.
you
may
have
an
arbitrator
but
you've
got
four
experts
with
you.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
but
who
is
the
state
commission's
decision
reviewable
by?
it's
not
reviewable
by
the
civil
aeronautics
board
where
there
is
some
expertise.
it's
reviewable
by
a
state
court
where
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
we'll
follow
legal
principles
that
would
not
have
any
particular
knowledge
as
to
the
abilities
of
qualifications
of
a
pilot.
this
is
where
the
thing
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
but
--
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
well
--
but
i
say,
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
you
don't
reach
the
decision
of
whether
discrimination
occurred
until
you
reached
the
prior
decision
of
qualifications.
mr.
patrick
m.
westfeldt
not
by
the
state
commission.
thank
you
very
much.
