justice
potter
stewart
continental's
first
position,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
there's
an
adequate
state
ground
to
support
this
judgment
that
the
--
that
your
colorado
courts
have
held
that
the
legislation
is
not
intended
to
apply
the
interstate
commerce
as
a
matter
of
the
construction
of
the
law,
the
state
legislation,
and
if
that's
true,
of
course
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
certainly
agree
that
if
--
if
the
statute
had
explicitly
said
that
it
was
to
be
inapplicable
to
interstate
carriers
by
air
that
you
couldn't
possibly
have
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
federal
question
here.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
and
it's
the
--
continental
still
makes
the
claim
that
that's
the
way
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
has
construed
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
nothing
or
whatever
to
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this
wasn't
even
the
first
time
the
court
has
done
that,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
court
did
continue
to
approve
the
findings
and
conclusions
and
reasoning
of
the
--
what
you
call
it?
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
district
court
of
denver
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
explicitly
did
rely
on
the
--
at
least
in
part
--
at
least
as
one
of
the
grounds
for
its
decision
on
the
fact
that
this
legislation
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
interstate
carriers,
if
i
--
am
i
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
could
have
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
that
wouldn't
again
be
the
first
time
of
the
court
which
could've
done
one
--
something
one
way
actually
did
it
another
way.
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
i
know
that
--
every
--
all
counsel
agree
that
they
took
it
out
of
their
opinion.
i
can't
quite
find
this
in
the
record
that
made
clear
to
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
opinion
as
we
have
it
in
the
record
beginning
on
page
290
or
whatever
it
is
--
the
288
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
the
opinion
as
amended
after
the
petition
for
rehearing.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it's
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
is
quite
a
distinct
and
separate
question
from
the
one
of
whether
or
not
federal
legislation
has
preempted
it.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
going
to
get
to
the
preemption
argument
which
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
[inaudible]
took
part
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
own
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
want
to
interfere
with
your
plan
of
argument,
but
i
do
hope
somebody's
going
to
get
to
that
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
in
mind,
particularly
section
404
(b)
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act
of
1938
which
was
in
effect
at
the
time
that
this
arose.
i
realize
that
statute
has
now
been
replaced
by
the
federal
aviation
act.
justice
potter
stewart
it
contains
different
languages.
justice
potter
stewart
it
requires
every
other
carrier
not
to
subject
any
particular
person
to
any
unjust
discrimination
or
any
undue
or
unreasonable
prejudice
or
disadvantage
in
any
respect,
whatsoever.
justice
potter
stewart
then
you
get
very
close
to
smith
--
to
nelson
against
pennsylvania,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
in
which
there
was
a
parity
of
interest
of
state
legislation
of
federal
law.
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
you
--
wouldn't
you
as
a
representative
of
california
think
that
you
would
be
happy
if
your
state
policy
were
enforced
nationally?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
it's
a
good
policy,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
my
suggestion
is
and
that
the
suggestion
of
the
respondent
would
be
that
the
deed
has
already
have
been
done.
section
404
(b)
for
example
does
require
exactly
what
you
say
california
requires,
but
in
this
case,
colorado
says
it
require
and
at
the
field
is
therefore
been
preempted.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
nobody
said
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
are
talking
about
a
specific
industry
and
specific
regulation
of
a
specific
industry.
we
are
not
talking
about
federal
law
generally.
we
are
talking
about
the
airline
industry
in
united
states
and
the
very
pervasive
federal
regulation
over
it.
we're
not
talking
about
generalities.
we
are
talking
about
preemption
in
this
field.
justice
potter
stewart
i
hope
you'll
address
yourself
to
that.
i've
been
talking
about
it,
but
it
but
i
haven't
heard
very
much
about
it
from
you.
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
mohawk?
justice
potter
stewart
just
on
that
point.
justice
potter
stewart
others
however
have
been
stricken
down,
have
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
the
--
is
that
the
length
of
the
train?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
was
that
curtain
case,
i
can't
even
remember
the
caption
of
the
case,
curtain,
do
you
know
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don't
either
but
there
is
such
a
case
on
which
i
think
they
struck
down
the
state
legislation.
i
think,
curtain
[inaudible]
locomotive
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
westfeldt,
in
the
posture
of
the
case
as
it
is
here
now
before
us,
don't
we
have
to
assume
that
he
was
refused
employment
by
your
company
on
the
basis
of
his
race.
whether
or
not
this
turns
out
to
be
true
as
a
matter
for
the
--
for
your
unemployment
or
made
for
your
non
--
whatever
this
commission
is
called
as
reviewed
by
your
state
courts,
but
as
the
case
is
presented
to
us
now,
there's
no
issue
at
all,
is
there,
unless
the
only
basis
on
which
he
was
refused
employment
was
because
he
was
a
negro.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
he
did
--
he
did
say
okay
on
this
man,
did
he
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
sentence
was
deleted.
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
is
the
sentence?
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
page
311?
justice
potter
stewart
it
begins
with
the
--
this
language
negatives
the
idea
--
is
that
--
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
and
that's
the
sentence.
it
was
originally
in
and
there
was
there
--
thereafter
taken
out
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
without
comment.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
page
296
of
the
record.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
296
of
the
record
beginning
in
the
state
of
colorado.
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
these
citations
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
just
trying
to
find
the
part
of
the
brief
which
you're
discussing,
the
practical
identity
with
the
language
of
the
civil
aeronautics
act
to
that
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
justice
potter
stewart
around
page
44.
justice
potter
stewart
has
this
language
--
this
1930
act
language
survived
in
the
new
federal
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
haec
verba
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
fitzgerald
was
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
brought
directly
in
the
federal
district
court,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
on
the
theory
that
404
(b)
conferred
federal
district
court
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
under
the
railway
labor
act?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
--
in
our
case
now
before
us,
there's
no
--
there's
no
claim
of
any
collusion
between
your
client
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
pilot's
union,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
fit
the
logic
of
anything,
i
agree
with
you,
but
the
point
is
that
in
the
second
case,
when
there's
just
unilateral
discrimination,
perhaps
the
railway
labor
act
is
not
in
--
is
not
applicable?
justice
potter
stewart
we
--
we
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
asserted
argumentatively
that
there
might
be
other
local
laws,
but
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
existence
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
like
that
was
stated
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
the
interstate
commerce
act
language
been
dormant
until
it
was
reawakened
in
mitchell?
justice
potter
stewart
white
pilots
might
have
an
objection
based
on
constitutional
grounds
in
a
federal
[inaudible]
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
it's
possible
i
suppose
in
legal
theory
for
the
person
to
be
unqualified
for
a
reason
which
might
indirectly
stem
from
his
race
but
not
because
of
his
race.
so
assuming
that
somebody
who
was
a
--
followed
the
tenants
of
the
black
muslims,
who
hated
white
people
so
badly
that
he
was
likely
to
get
so
infuriated
that
he
might
shoot
one.
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
want
somebody
like
that
as
a
co-pilot
with
a
flight
--
flight
crew
for
safety
reasons
and
yet
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
assuming
this
person
had
been
born
a
white
man
instead
of
colored
man,
he
--
chances
are
he
would
not
have
become
a
black
muslim.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
--
it's
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
your
position
as
it's
so,
that
--
as
to
racial
discrimination,
the
federal
standard
is
a
different
standard
from
that
imposed
by
colorado
in
any
way?
justice
potter
stewart
each
requires
complete
lack
of
discrimination
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
identical?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
mean,
(voice
overlap)
--m
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
language
doesn't
fit
this
case,
does
it,
because
the
applicable
federal
statute
was
enacted
in
1938
and
at
that
time
this
colorado
remedy
was
not
then
existed?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
arose
prior
to
1958,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
or
when
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
very
small
point,
but
i
only
suggest
that
the
--
the
colorado
remedy
when
the
1938
statute
was
enacted
was
not
a
then
existing
remedy.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
that
could
be
said
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
also
which
has
been
held
to
have
required
--
to
have
required
complete
non-discrimination
based
on
races
among
passengers
and
that
terminal
facility,
wouldn't
the
same
inference
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
withdrawable?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
fair
--
is
it
fair
to
surmise
mr.
taylor
that
if
they
were
no
fair
employment
legislation
in
colorado
and
if
continental
air
lines
on
its
own
[inaudible]
--
on
its
motion
had
for
purely
racial
reasons
turn
down
a
completely
qualified
applicant
for
a
pilot
that
you
might
not
be
arguing
here
that
the
federal
law
required
them
not
to
discriminate?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
imagining
a
case
that
doesn't
exist
and
maybe
that's
an
unfair
question
but
it
occurs
to
me
that
you
would
have
a
pretty
good
case
if
you
were
here?
