mr.
howard
h.
jewel
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
members
of
the
court.
california
is
one
of
those
states
which
has
a
commission
which
varies
in
many
respects
with
the
colorado
anti-discrimination
commission.
we
call
ours
the
fair
employment
practice
commission
but
its
duties
and
as
i
understand,
the
colorado
commission,
its
jurisdictions
are
roughly
comparable.
when
our
legislature
enacted
the
law
creating
our
fair
employment
practice
commission,
it
stated
its
policy
which
i
would
i
like
to
read
to
this
court.
it
stated
the
policy
to
be
as
follows.
“it
is
hereby
declared
as
the
public
policy
of
this
state
that
it
is
necessary
to
protect
and
safeguard
the
right
and
opportunity
of
all
persons
to
seek,
obtain,
and
hold
employment
without
discrimination
or
abridgment
on
account
of
race,
religious
creed,
color,
national
origin
or
ancestry.
it
is
recognized
that
the
practice
of
denying
employment
opportunity
and
discriminating
in
terms
of
employment
for
such
reasons
commence
domestic
strife
and
unrest,
deprives
the
state
of
the
fullest
utilization
of
its
capacities
for
development
and
advance,
and
substantially
and
adversely
affects
the
interest
of
employees,
employers
and
the
public
in
general.”
now,
it
is
in
defense
of
this
policy
of
california
that
we
have
asked
leave
of
this
court
to
appear
as
amicus
and
it
is
in
defense
of
this
policy
that
i
speak.
as
we
understand
this
case,
this
case
poses
a
rather
grave
threat
to
that
policy
for
us
here
in
california.
i
note
that
continental
in
its
petition
states
that
on
page
19
or
in
its
brief
states
that
they
do
not
challenge
the
authority
of
colorado
under
its
police
powers
to
enact
fair
employment
legislation
nor
to
apply
such
legislation
to
employees
of
interstate
employers
generally
to
employees
of
interstate
employer.
but
i
think
it's
unfortunately
true
that
the
admission
of
the
--
of
continental
in
this
case
would
not
be
binding
upon
the
court.
and
the
burden
which
the
--
which
the
continental
seeks
to
urge
upon
this
court
is
not
a
burden
which
goes
only
to
airline
pilots,
unfortunately.
as
i
make
it
out,
the
airline
pilots
are
only
distinguishable
from
other
employees
of
interstate
commerce
carriers
and
in
that,
there
is
a
--
a
rather
particular
and
specified
group
of
federal
regulations
which
have
to
do
with
safety
and
since
mr.
green
in
this
case
has
been
certificated
by
the
federal
authorities,
and
so
far
as
i
know,
there
has
been
no
word
in
this
record
to
the
effect
that
mr.
green
was
in
any
way
an
unsafe
pilot
or
was
in
any
way
uncertificated.
that
issue
so
far
as
the
--
as
the
limitation
of
this
--
of
this
problem
to
airline
pilots
seems
to
be
questionable
because
the
burden
as
the
respondents
allege
is
not
a
burden
which
is
limited
only
to
airline
pilots
but
it
applies
generally.
the
burden
that
they
allege
is
one
of
multiplicity
and
they
stated
rather
eloquently
in
their
brief
at
pages
20,
21,
22,
and
23.
they
point
out
at
such
things
as
a
fact
that
the
various
commissions
have
various
numbers
of
commissioners
who
receive
various
salaries
and
that
they
have
different
means
of
enforcing
these
procedures.
some
by
penal
sanction,
others
simply
by
persuasion,
et
cetera
and
they
document
this
more
fully
for
the
court
in
their
appendix
a
of
their
brief
which
describes
in
some
great
detail
the
multiplicity
of
state
and
federal
or
of
state
commissions
having
to
do
with
this
subject.
this
applies
not
only
if
there's
a
burden
in
continental
with
respect
to
airline
pilots,
but
i
would
think
there
would
be
so
far
as
multiplicity
is
concerned,
the
burden
also
with
stewardesses,
perhaps
they'd
burden
also
with
other
continental
employees
who
are
required
to
physically
be
--
to
physically
go
from
state
to
state.
and
i
suspect
the
number
of
employees
in
this
respect
would
be
considerable
since
continental
operates
in
many
states,
and
i
presume,
they
have
occasion
for
example
to
send
accountants
from
one
of
their
offices
to
another.
well,
there's
any
number
of
employees
of
continental
who
must
travel
from
state
to
state.
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
i
was
--
yes
sir,
i
was
going
to
come
next
to
it.
it
would
apply
not
only
to
airline
employees
but
to
all
other
employees
who
are
actually
in
the
business
of
transportation.
and
why
not
to
other
employees
--
other
employers
who
are
actually
engaged
in
interstate
commerce,
any
manufacturer
who
sends
employees
from
state
to
state
might
similarly
make
the
same
burdens
or
make
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
the
burden
on
the
commerce
here
is
the
burden
of
multiplicity
of
state
action.
in
addition,
and
i
have
been
told
that
--
that
up
to
approximately
48%
of
all
california
employees
for
one
purpose
or
another
--
or
another
might
be
considered
to
be
within
--
within
interstate
to
be
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
or
in
occupations
which
affect
interstate
commerce.
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
up
to
48%
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
well,
it's
a
--
i
agree
with
you,
sir.
it's
a
figure
that
is
extremely
difficult
to
come
by.
i
put
the
question
to
our
bureau
--
chief
of
our
bureau
of
labor
statistics
in
california
and
he
indicated
great
difficulty
in
doing
anything
that
was
precise
and
therefore,
i
didn't
offer
a
precise
figure
and
absolute
numbers,
but
in
any
amount,
we
think
it's
substantial
and
we
are
concerned
and
that's
why
--
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
so
--
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
yes,
sir
--
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
well
--
then
i'm
going
--
let
me
talk
about
--
we
contend
--
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
yes.
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
we
contend
sir
that
the
governing
law
of
this
case
is
the
law
of
cooley
versus
board
of
wardens.
we
think
that
this
--
this
is
an
elderly
doctrine
of
law
which
has
been
employed
by
this
court
invariably
in
these
matters
and
not
to
be
employed
again
in
this
situation.
as
i
understand
the
doctrine
of
that
case,
it
is
simply
that
this
court
will
--
will
look
and
any
time
a
piece
of
state
legislation
is
challenged,
as
being
in
conflict
with
or
in
opposition
to
the
federal
right
to
--
the
congressional
right
to
regulate
the
commerce,
this
court
will
take
a
close
look.
and
to
that
purpose,
it
will
consider
such
matters
as
the
pervasiveness
of
the
state
legislation,
a
subject
to
be
involved
the
need
for
uniformity
versus
the
right
of
the
state
--
of
the
individual
state
to
legislative
matters
to
protect
its
own
or
in
accordance
with
its
own
police
powers.
we
think
that
the
whole
case
is
simply
a
manifestation
of
the
application
of
this
doctrine.
we
think
that
the
morgan
case
is
an
application
of
this
doctrine.
we
think
that
the
bob-lo
excursion
case
is
another
application.
in
each
one
of
these
cases,
the
court
considered
the
relative
merits
of
the
--
of
the
commerce
on
the
one
side
and
the
right
of
the
state
on
the
other
to
regulate
for
its
police
power.
i
think
although
it's
on
a
different
subject
matter
that
pennsylvania
versus
nelson
that
mr.
justice
harlan
raised
was
a
--
is
another
example
of
that
situation
that
had
to
do
with
the
problem
of
communism.
i
think
that,
if
i'm
not
mistaken
--
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
yes.
well,
it's
a
preemption
but
the
--
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
the
court
considered
very
carefully
and
recorded
in
its
report
the
testimony
of
mr.
j.
edgar
hoover
who
discussed
the
fact
that
this
was
a
nationwide
conspiracy
that
we
were
dealing
with
--
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
for
the
pre
--
yes.
if
i
said
commerce
--
it
was
not
a
commerce
--
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
burden
and
--
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
well,
the
questions
of
preemption
as
i
make
them
out
here
have
to
do
with
--
with
the
railway
--
the
railway
labor
act
and
that
--
or
rather
let
me
take
the
commerce
--
the
federal
communication
act
first.
in
the
preamble
to
that
act,
there's
mentioned
in
there
the
word
“discrimination”.
the
act
was
passed
sometime,
i
think
originally
in
the
1920s,
i
maybe
mistaken
on
the
date.
there
has
never
been
in
california,
so
far
as
i
know,
and
i
have
been
--
my
attention
has
never
been
drawn
to
--
in
any
other
jurisdiction
for
any
of
these
federal
--
federal
acts
which
are
urged
upon
this
court
as
preempt
in
this
area
have
ever
in
any
way
been
applied
to
anybody
who
applied
--
who
applied
for
a
job
and
was
refused
because
of
his
race.
now,
there
have
been
one
or
two
cases
in
which
these
acts
were
extended
to
cover
passengers,
the
fitzgerald
case
was
one
example
of
that.
whether
or
not,
the
congress
had
in
mind
the
protection
of
passengers
from
racial
discrimination
in
the
enactment
of
those
laws,
i
have
no
idea,
but
they
--
whether
they
did
or
not,
i
shouldn't
think
that
whether
they
cover
passengers
who
have
any
significance
as
precedent
in
this
case
which
has
to
do
only
with
employment
--
with
discrimination
in
employment.
i
can
say
to
the
members
of
this
court
that
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
such
thing
in
california
that
there
never
has
been
practically
any
such
thing
in
california
as
the
use
of
either
the
railway
labor
act
or
the
federal
aviation
act
by
anybody
who
claimed
he
was
being
discriminated
against
--
because
of
his
race
by
an
employer
who
is
--
who
is
subject
to
one
of
these
acts.
it's
a
brand
new
concept
that
if
it
exists,
it
exists
in
a
vacuum
so
far
as
i
know.
and
there
are
cases
to
which
i
can't
immediately
point
on
by
this
court
wherein
the
court
has
stated
that
unless
there'd
be
some
conflict
shown
with
respect
to
the
preemption
or
unless
the
subject
matter
be
such
so
as
to
indicate
that
the
congress
itself
has
wanted
to
exert
100%
of
its
jurisdiction
that
the
court
will
not
--
will
not
use
or
will
not
hold
that
the
state
act
is
--
has
been
preempted.
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
completely
--
a
completely
new
concept
to
us
and
i
wonder
what
would
have
been
the
case
for
example
if
mr.
green
in
this
situation
had
made
application
to
the
federal
commerce
commission
or
to
--
to
his
--
exert
some
rights
under
the
--
under
the
railway
labor
act.
certainly,
he
would
have
been
operating
in
a
brand
new
area
for
them
because
no
case
has
ever
come
to
my
attention
and
i
think
the
court
will
hear
of
none.
there
have
been
none
any
of
the
briefs
where
any
of
these
agencies
of
the
federal
government
who
are
responsible
for
the
administration
of
these
acts
have
ever
ruled
one
way
or
another
with
respect
to
this
question.
i
don't
think
the
matter
has
ever
--
has
ever
been
brought
up
to
them.
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
this
is
the
act
which
contains
the
single
word
of
--
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
yes.
it
includes
the
word,
if
i
recall
it
correctly,
discrimination
and
refers
to
service
in
the
act.
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
in
the
--
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
can
only
respond
to
you
that
--
that
if
that
section
gives
a
right
to
people
in
mr.
green's
situation,
it
has
never
been
exercised
in
the
state
of
california.
we
have
no
--
we
have
no
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
any
--
of
any
right.
now,
conceivably
it
could
but
the
case
has
--
the
case
has
--
has
never
a
reason
in
which
it
has
and
there
had
been
--
even
when
there
had
been
attempts
to
apply
this
kind
of
language
to
passengers,
they
have
been
--
there
have
been
resistant
--
there
has
been
resistance
to
this
doctrine.
it
has
simply
never
been
--
never
been
attempted
anywhere.
therefore,
i
would
urge
upon
the
court,
no
semblance
of
any
conflict
between
the
federal
act
and
then
section
404
(b)
and
the
activities
of
the
state
anti-discrimination
commission.
the
worst
that
could
be
said
in
such
an
instance
is
that
the
colorado
anti-discrimination
commission
is
simply
carrying
out
the
intendments
of
section
404
(b)
of
the
federal
act.
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
well
i
--
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
parity
of
interest
there,
sir,
but
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
it
was
the
--
it
was
the
position
of
the
federal
government
in
pennsylvania
versus
nelson
that
there
needed
definitely
to
be
a
federal
preemption
in
this
area
in
order
that
we
may
come
back
what
was
in
essence,
what
is
in
essence
a
federal
conspiracy.
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
no
sir.
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
well,
i
was
going
to
come
to
that.
we're
in
a
strange
situation
in
this
case.
those
of
us
who
are
advocating
in
behalf
of
civil
rights
measure
because
we
do
not
ask
in
this
particular
case
that
the
policies
and
experience
of
california
should
be
translated
to
the
other
49
states,
rather
the
reverse.
we
only
ask
that
this
court
enable
us
in
california
to
maintain
the
policies
which
our
experience,
in
our
state
and
have
led
us
to
believe
our
wise
policies
for
us.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
spread
our
california
law
to
other
states.
we're
only
asking
this
court
to
maintain
our
california
law
in
our
state.
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
if
this
--
if
this
is
the
situation
sir,
then
i
for
one,
i'm
learning
it
for
the
first
time.
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
i'm
not
complaining
about
that
doctrine
certainly
and
if
this
court
wishes
--
wish
to
announce
that
doctrine,
i'm
sure
representing
the
state
of
california
in
our
interest
in
the
matter,
we
would
be
very
gratified.
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
that
is
true,
sir.
but
--
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
i
believe
that
so,
sir.
we
would
have
then
--
if
that
were
the
situation,
all
employees
in
california
would
be
treated
equally
regardless
of
whether
they
were
subject
to
federal
or
state
law.
but
if
the
colorado,
the
doctrine
as
announced
by
the
colorado
court
is
reaffirmed,
then
we
will
have
two
classes
of
employees
in
california;
those
who
have
the
protection
of
fpp
and
those
who
have
the
protection
of
some
federal
law,
which
to
date
has
never
been
--
has
never
been
--
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
but
--
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
well,
sorry.
i
tried
to
express
my
concern
that
it
would
be
very
hard
for
us
to
specifically
delimit
this
on
any
ground
that
i
know
of
to
one
particular
class
of
employees.
maybe
your
own
is
in
my
assumption,
but
--
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
that
--
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
--
that
might
conceivably
be
so
sir
in
a
diff
--
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
well,
i
have
no
--
as
i
say,
i
would
agree
that
it
ought
to
work
both
ways
and
--
but
i
just
have
not
known
of
the
existence
of
this
doctrine.
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
yes
sir,
we
would
and
we
do
up
to
--
and
have.
we
have
--
we
have
always
felt
that
we
had
jurisdiction
over
these
kinds
of
employees.
mr.
howard
h.
jewel
no
sir,
there
is
none
and
none
according
to
age.
mr.
howard
