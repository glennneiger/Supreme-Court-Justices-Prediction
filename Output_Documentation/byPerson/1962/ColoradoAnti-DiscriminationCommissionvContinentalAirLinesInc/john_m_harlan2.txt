john
m.
harlan
you're
going
to
comment
on
the
conclusion
of
pennsylvania
against
nelson?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
question
is
not
whether
they
have
a
federal
reach
because
among
the
grounds
of
the
state
court's
decision
was
an
adequate
state
premise.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
state
court
goes
on
both
grounds
to
choose
as
to
some
reason
it
will
reach
federal
questions
and
also
include
state
grounds
because
as
our
truly
recognized
state
grounds.
that
should
probably
be
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
preemption,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
was
commerce
clause
preemption?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
talking
about
the
burden
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
somebody
on
your
side
address
yourself
on
preemption.
justice
john
m.
harlan
put
that
thing
in
other
way
if
you're
representing
an
institution
itself
and
the
construction
of
the
statute
of
the
state
is
that
it
would
be
segregated
and
the
opposite
of
the
matter
is
i
suppose
the
first
thing
you'd
be
arguing
is
the
federal
acts
preempt
the
state
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
would
be
a
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
with
reference
to
the
evidence
of
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
not
suggesting
that
new
york
was
preemptable?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
year
was
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
19
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
45.
justice
john
m.
harlan
for
sure,
they
were
not
trying
out
that
issue.
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
case
is
here
on
findings
of
the
commission
that
this
man
was
excluded
solely
on
the
grounds
of
race.
you're
not
--
your
state
court
didn't
disturb
those
findings,
you're
not
contesting
them
here
and
that's
the
platform
that
we've
got
to
start
from.
isn't
that
all
there
is
to
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
do
we
get
into
these
collateral
issues
with
this
--
this
case
is
here
in
that
posture?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes
but
if
you've
been
able
to
show
the
commission
here
that
this
man
apart
from
his
color
was
not
a
qualified
pilot,
the
commission
would
have
had
no
other
--
no
interest
in
it,
i
take
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
shouldn't
they?
so
--
why
do
--
why
don't
you
get
down
to
the
question
really
--
the
bottom
of
this
case,
questions
of
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
just
you
quoted
on
page
15
of
your
brief,
don't
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
also
got
this
statement
of
the
--
next
to
the
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion
in
which
your
court
says
the
state
of
colorado
either
does
or
does
not
have
power
to
legislate
concerning
racial
discrimination
by
employers
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
it
goes
on
to
conclude
that
there's
no
power.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'm
using
the
opinion
from
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
using
the
petition
for
cert
here
which
i
find
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
state
of
colorado.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
question
i'm
putting
to
you
is
this.
i'm
wondering
whether
it's
a
fair
reading
of
this
opinion
to
say
that
what
actually
the
colorado
supreme
court
did
was
to
say
that
they
had
to
include
--
they
had
to
construe
--
they
had
to
construe
their
statute
as
they
did
because
of
their
views
as
to
the
constitutional
question
--
federal
constitutional
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
if
they
did
that
that
certainly
would
not
be
an
adequate
state
ground.
