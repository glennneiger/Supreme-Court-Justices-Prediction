mr.
westfeldt,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
don't
have
--
for
stewardess,
you
don't
have
to
have
a
federal
license,
yet
you
say
that
you
can't
--
this
commission
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
over
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
in
our
--
in
our
wagner
act,
and
other
labor
laws,
isn't
there
a
great
deal
of
legislative
history
and
declaration
of
policy
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
preempt
the
situation
as
--
as
you
said
it
has
been
done
in
garmin
and
the
rest
of
the
cases?
where
here,
as
i
understand
it,
you
have
been
unable
to
find
any
legislative
history
or
any
declaration
of
policy
in
this
specific
area
and
there
certainly
was
legislative
history
in
the
labor
fields.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
there's
no
question
about
it
on
what
you
could
find
legislative
history
on
the
question
of
discrimination
as
to
passengers
in
the
kind
of
service
that
they
--
that
they
rendered,
no,
there
wouldn't
be
any
trouble
in
doing
that
would
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
on
the
other
hand,
when
you
say
that
the
employment
field
is
preempted,
you
cannot
find
any
discussion
of
any
before
the
congress
on
that
subject
even
to
indicate
that
they
were
legislating
in
that
area.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
got
--
counsel
pointed
out
that
this
word
discrimination
was
used
invariably
in
the
sections
of
the
act
that
had
to
do
with
service
and
that
of
course
is
legislative
history,
i
think
that
we
must
consider.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
thought
they
put
their
decision
on
the
ground
that
you
yourselves
had
found
this
man
to
be
qualified.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
taylor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
