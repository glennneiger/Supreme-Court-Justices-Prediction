on
what
do
you
base
that?
justice

what
practical

justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
practical
interpretation
of
the
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
say
that
he
does
that
he
did
it
in
either
or
both?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
judgment
do
you
cover
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
did
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
trial
down
there
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
take
it
your
client
wanted
to
try
it
there
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
instead
of
in
tennessee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
be
an
impermissible
interpretation
of
the
rule
to
say
that
the
counterclaim
can
always
be
treated
so
long
as
it
has
not
been
adjudicated
in
our
aid
after
the
adjudication,
in
other
words,
it's
never
been
satisfied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
in
some
instances,
courts
have
said
that
although
two
courts
have
jurisdiction
of
a
matter,
the
one
that
the
first
acts
on
it
shall
be
accepted
as
final.
what
would
be
wrong
with
that
interpretation
of
this
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
which
one
has
--
first
has
jurisdiction.
i'm
talking
about
so
long
as
the
claim
is
outstanding
and
not
satisfied.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
of
course
literally
--
that
is
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
logically
it's
correct
and
--
but
maybe
in
here
in
writing
this
rule
even
lawyers
have
failed
to
write
one
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
do
what
the
rule
is
supposed
to
do,
achieve
the
end
of
justice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
basically
at
the
bottom
is
the
idea
that
the
man
has
a
counterclaim
he'll
have
an
opportunity
to
enforce
it
somewhere
during
the
time
they
--
before
