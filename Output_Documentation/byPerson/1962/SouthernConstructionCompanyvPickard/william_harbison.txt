mr.
william
harbison
may
it
please
the
court.
if
the
court
please,
in
the
interest
of
time,
if
this
is
agreed
with
the
court
the
two
sides
would
be
willing
to
split
the
remaining
time
for
the
day
if
that
is
satisfactory
with
the
court.
mr.
william
harbison
i
think
we
state
our
points
very
briefly,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
william
harbison
alright,
sir
and
so
i
will
take
just
about
10
or
12
minutes,
if
the
court
please.
may
it
please
the
court,
these
are
--
this
is
a
miller
act
case
arising
in
the
middle
district
of
tennessee.
the
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
if
the
court
please,
briefly,
i
can
state
the
situation.
this
is
a
procedure
case
involving
rule
13
(a)
or
one
of
the
other
rules,
rule
8
in
which,
we
have
this
situation,
may
it
please
the
court,
and
i
think
there
is
no
dispute
really
about
the
underlying
facts.
southern
construction
company
is
in
the
general
contracting
business
and
had
two
separates
sets
of
contracts
with
the
united
states
government
for
the
rehabilitation
of
barracks.
one
set
of
these
contracts
was
at
fort
benning,
georgia,
the
other
contract
a
much
smaller
one
was
at
fort
campbell,
tennessee.
the
two
contracts
were
let
separately
and
there
was
no
--
nothing
in
common
between
them
except
it
happened
to
be
the
same
general
contractor.
it
happened
also
that
the
pickard
engineering
company
of
washington
d.c.
was
the
mechanical
subcontractor,
the
successful
bidder
on
each
set
of
contracts,
submitting
a
bid
in
georgia
and
being
awarded
the
subcontract
there,
another
bid
in
tennessee,
being
awarded
the
bid
there.
the
work
on
the
two
contracts,
however,
proceeded
simultaneously
and
pickard
had
one
common
supplier
furnishing
the
majority
of
his
materials
being
the
atlas
supply
company
of
atlanta,
georgia
from
whom
he
bought
most
of
the
materials
that
he
put
into
both
of
these
two
jobs.
pickard
left
both
jobs,
if
the
court
please,
before
they
were
complete
under
circumstances
that
are
not
now
particularly
material
except
that
he
left
the
fort
campbell
job
in
december
1955,
he
left
the
fort
benning
jobs
shortly
after
that
and
southern
the
prime
contractor
completed
both
jobs.
at
the
time
when
pickard
left,
if
the
court
please,
he
owed
admittedly
on
account
at
fort
campbell,
tennessee
to
at
least
of
$34,520.
he
had
so
certified
to
southern
and
atlas
had
also
billed
southern
in
that
amount.
at
the
time
he
left
fort
benning,
georgia,
atlas
claimed
that
southern
owed
it
or
that
pickard
owed
it
and
southern
secondarily
under
the
miller
act
a
$104,000.
the
record
in
this
shows
that
southern
never
disputed
the
account
at
fort
campbell,
tennessee,
had
no
basis
upon
which
they
disputed.
but
it
disputed
in
its
entirely
the
billing
made
to
it
because
it
was
liable
under
the
miller
act
by
atlas
at
fort
benning,
georgia
and
denied
any
validity
to
that
account
whatever
of
mr.
pickard's.
if
the
court
please,
businessmen
don't
always
act
as
one
might
wish
them
to
act
and
in
august
1956,
southern
and
atlas
met
together
and
southern
paid
atlas
a
lump
sum
of
$35,000
and
accepted
a
complete
release
of
it's
liability
to
atlas
under
the
miller
act
on
both
jobs.
those
--
that
check
is
in
the
record.
the
money
was
paid.
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
the
money
--
the
payment
was
not
allocated
by
southern
at
that
time
to
either
job,
both
of
them
had
some
--
had
gone
to
substantial
completion.
mr.
pickard
was
shown
of
the
record
to
be
insolvent
and
southern
simply
did
not
make
an
allocation
at
that
time.
they
just
made
the
payment
and
settled
a
business
transaction
and
the
check
is
in
the
record.
then,
if
the
court
please,
in
december
1956,
some
months
after
this
payment
was
made
on
august,
1956,
mr.
pickard
brought
a
suit
against
southern
under
the
miller
act
in
the
middle
district
of
georgia
claiming
that
he
had
not
been
fully
paid
on
both
jobs.
he
--
his
suit
clearly,
a
complaint
is
in
the
record,
shows
that
he
sued
in
that
action
in
december
1956,
on
both
at
fort
campbell,
tennessee
job
and
the
fort
benning,
georgia
job
claiming
certain
amounts
due
to
him.
of
course
as
the
court
knows
the
time
for
pleading
is
20
days
and
within
the
20
days,
southern
filed
an
answer
and
counterclaim
setting
up
the
defense
that
it
had
more
than
paid
to
mr.
pickard
or
to
his
suppliers,
the
contract
prices
on
both
jobs
and
asserting
a
counterclaim
against
him
on
both
jobs.
at
that
time,
the
$35,000
payment
was
included
in
this
georgia
case
because
the
tennessee
contract
was
also
in
the
georgia
case
at
that
time.
now
it
is
true
that
the
miller
act
provides
that
suits
shall
be
brought
in
the
district
where
the
work
is
done
and
nowhere
else.
so
some
months
later
in
april
of
1957,
mr.
pickard
brought
a
separate
suit
in
the
middle
district
of
tennessee
on
the
fort
campbell,
tennessee
contract,
although
that
wasn't
formally
deleted
from
the
pleadings
in
georgia
until
the
trial
of
the
georgia
case,
he
did
bring
a
separate
suit
in
tennessee
in
april
1957
on
the
tennessee
contract
alone.
it
was
then,
if
the
court
please,
that
southern
was
faced
with
the
problem
of
where
this
$35,000
payment
made
on
august
1956
properly
should
be
allocated
because
it
was
now
faced
with
two
separates
suits
on
two
separates
contracts.
the
underlying
facts
as
i
have
stated
to
the
court
were
that
southern
had
paid
$34,520
on
the
tennessee
contract
which
it
did
not
dispute
to
atlas
and
a
token
payment
on
the
fort
benning's
contract
which
it
had
disputed
in
its
entirety
and
obtained
a
complete
release.
now,
southern
is
a
bonded
contractor
and
obviously
its
position
about
there
being
a
substantial
dispute
in
the
atlas
billings
must
have
been
correct
because
otherwise
there
would
be
no
reason
for
atlas
to
make
such
a
settlement
with
southern.
so
southern,
if
the
court
please,
under
this
undertaking
claimed
this
$34,520
payment
as
a
credit
on
the
tennessee
contract
which
the
district
court
allowed
over
the
objection
however
of
mr.
pickard
that
the
$34,520
payment
or
$35,000
payment
was
a
compulsory
counterclaim
and
had
to
be
asserted
by
southern
in
the
georgia
proceedings
or
not
be
asserted
at
all
that
--
paid
it
to
assert
it
there
would
be
res
judicata.
the
georgia
case
was
tried
first
in
march
of
1959
and
in
that
trial
of
that
case,
neither
side
listed
this
$35,000
payment
or
any
part
of
it
as
being
a
credit
on
the
georgia
contract.
that
has
been
found
concurrently
by
both
the
district
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
is
a
fact,
if
the
court
please.
it
was
not
claimed
by
southern
in
the
trial
of
that
case.
it
was
not
credited
by
mr.
pickard
in
the
trial
of
that
case
as
properly
being
allocable
to
that
case,
any
part
of
it.
the
tennessee
case
came
only
for
trial
some
months
later
and
southern
claimed
the
$35,000
payment
or
$34,520
of
it
in
as
a
credit
in
the
tennessee
case
which
the
district
court
allowed,
but
which
this
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
and
held
that
the
$35,000
payment
was
a
compulsory
counterclaim
under
rule
13
(a)
in
georgia
and
could
not
be
asserted
by
southern
in
the
tennessee
case.
mr.
william
harbison
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
william
harbison
there
was
--
let
me
--
say
this,
there
was
a
trial,
there
was
jury
verdict
for
mr.
pickard
which
were
set
aside
by
the
district
court.
mr.
pickard's
theory
in
that
case,
if
the
court
please,
was
a
rescission
of
the
contract
in
a
quantum
merit
in
the
district
court.
mr.
william
harbison
no,
sir.
mr.
pickard's
suit
has
been
dismissed.
now
southern's
counterclaim
in
the
georgia
case
has
remained
open,
if
the
court
please,
southern
claimed
that
they
overpaid
mr.
pickard
and
that
remains
open
in
the
georgia
case,
if
the
court
please,
at
this
time.
southern
--
mr.
william
harbison
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
assume
we
are
free
to
assert
it
if
it
belongs
there,
although,
the
trial
of
that
case
is
a
very
lengthy
and
very
expensive
process.
and
--
mr.
william
harbison
we
could
not
collect
it,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
william
harbison
they
have
a
judgment
against
us
in
tennessee
as
a
result
to
the
different
--
court
of
appeals
decision,
if
the
court
please,
where
its
--
mr.
william
harbison
exactly.
exactly,
if
the
court
please,
that
if
--
excuse
me
--
mr.
william
harbison
no,
sir.
mr.
william
harbison
it
has
been
filed,
if
the
court
please,
southern
has
a
notice
out
to
get
an
affirmative
judgment
against
pickard
and
has
no
desire
to
proceed
with
it
unless
we
are
compelled
to
proceed
there
with
it.
mr.
william
harbison
if
the
court
please,
there
is
a
judgment
against
us
for
34,000
odd
dollars
with
interest
which
has
been
stayed
temporally
pending
this
court's
decision
of
the
matter
by
bond
which
is
of
somewhat
expensive
process.
mr.
william
harbison
exactly.
the
court
--
we
have
to
pay
that,
if
the
court
please,
it's
gone.
we
can
never
get
--
mr.
william
harbison
can't
collect
--
mr.
william
harbison
exactly
sir.
we
can't
--
mr.
william
harbison
exactly.
mr.
william
harbison
yes,
sir.
that
is
exactly
the
practical
situations
that
we
find
ourselves
faced
with,
if
the
court
please.
and
we
feel
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
given
it
--
for
it
to
have
a
technical
construction
to
rule
13
(a)
because
they
said
this,
if
the
court
please,
their
rationale
was
that
we
--
they
said
this
item
was
compulsory
in
either
of
two
suits
and
was
compulsory
and
assumed
which
we
first
had
to
plead,
overlooking
the
fact
however
that
the
two
suits
were
not
filed
simultaneously,
they
were
filed
at
separate
times.
the
georgia
suit
was
filed
first
and
then
the
tennessee
suit
is
taken
out
of
that
and
filed
separately
in
tennessee.
that
that
is
the
--
the
fact
situation
we
were
faced
with
and
we
tried
to
plead
this
claimants
according
to
the
underlying
facts
which
have
been
found
concurrently
and
i
think
they're
not
in
dispute,
if
the
court
please,
and
we
feel
that
the
payment
belonged
to
the
tennessee
contract
and
not
to
the
georgia
one.
mr.
william
harbison
because,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
william
harbison
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
harbison
well,
if
the
court
please,
the
--
as
i
said
the
rationale
was
this
of
the
sixth
circuit
that
we
had
--
that
there
were
two
suits
against
us
and
it
was
compulsory
in
either
of
them.
we
say
they
were
not
too
simultaneous
suits.
we
had
to
plead
in
georgia
first,
if
the
court
please.
and
in
--
for
example,
there
were
a
number
other
payments
on
the
tennessee
contract,
in
addition
of
this
$34,000
one.
there's
been
no
objection
to
have
--
withdrawing
them
from
the
georgia
and
filing
them
in
the
tennessee
case.
but
this
one
item
which
settled
both
accounts,
they
say,
we
have
no
option
that
the
defendant
has
no
option
where
to
plead
it
whatever
the
underlying
facts
are.
this
is
what
--
mr.
william
harbison
yes,
sir.
if
the
court
please,
where
you
have
--
rule
13
(a)
it
seems
to
us
never
contemplated
the
situation
where
defendant
was
faced
with
two
separate
suits
on
two
separate
contracts.
mr.
william
harbison
exactly.
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
william
harbison
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
this
your
honor.
if
the
two
suits
had
been
filed
simultaneously
so
that
we
had
an
option
of
pleading
it
according
to
its
underlying
facts,
we
would
be
bound
by
that
option,
but
that
didn't
happen.
erroneously,
it
--
there
was
a
suit
brought
in
georgia
pertaining
to
the
tennessee
contract
which
was
later
withdrawn
and
brought
separately
in
tennessee
and
when
that
was
done,
we
claimed
the
right
to
plead
as
a
defense
and
we
claimed
that
this
is
really
in
a
--
a
defense
we
are
seeking
no
affirmative
judgment
over
in
the
sense
of
a
counterclaim
in
that
sense
of
an
affirmative
judgment
that
it
belongs
in
the
case
where
the
payment
was
admittedly
made
or
all
but
just
a
token
part
of
it,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
william
harbison
exactly
sir.
yes,
sir.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
william
harbison
yes
sir,
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
make
this
statement.
rule
8
(a)
in
addition
to
rule
1
which
justice
goldberg
mentioned
talks
about
payments
as
a
premature
defense.
we
are
not
seeking
a
judgment
against
mr.
pickard,
if
the
court
please
but
we
are
strongly
resisting
getting
one
against
us.
we
have
paid
this
money
for
debts
that
he
says
are
valid.
if
the
court
please,
he
had
this
check
in
his
file
in
the
georgia
case.
he
put
on
sworn
testimony
in
the
georgia
case.
he
did
not
list
this
check
as
a
payment
made
on
his
behalf
in
georgia
neither
did
we,
if
the
court
please
and
if
the
court
please,
we
think
that
it
would
be
highly
inequitable.
the
georgia
case
took
a
week
to
try
it
in
order
for
us
to
get
credit
for
this
thing.
we've
got
to
show
it
was
a
valid
claim
on
a
valid
debt
or
reasonably
required
payment.
and
we
think
we
have
done
that
in
the
tennessee
case
where
it
belonged,
if
the
court
please,
because
those
were
the
facts
under
which
the
payment
was
made
and
that's
been
found
concurrently
by
two
courts.
there's
no
dispute
in
that
facts
underlying
that,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
william
harbison
exactly.
if
the
court
please,
we
have
admitted
owing
that
up
there
and
he
certified
that
he
owed
that
much
than
--
mr.
william
harbison
--
34,520.
he
also
certified
he
owed
a
104,000
in
georgia
but
atlas
said,
they
didn't
agree
to
any
that,
if
the
court
please,
and
the
record
so
showed.
they
didn't
admit
any
validity
to
this
georgia
indebtedness.
they
claimed
we
have
been
billed
twice.
we
hadn't
got
credits
for
payment
made
down
there
and
we
denied
owing
anything
and
obviously
when
they
took
35,
if
the
court
please,
we
found
they've
been
just
about
correct
in
that.
mr.
william
harbison
if
the
court
please,
he
sued
to
try
to
rescind
and
sue
--
try
to
rescind
the
contract
and
sue
for
one
merit
but
the
trial
court
clearly
could
not
do
that
and
he
is
confined
to
the
contract
price
in
tennessee
and
there's
no
appeal
from
that
here.
now,
if
we
are
allowed
the
$34,000
payment
as
credit
in
tennessee,
we
have
overpaid
them
and
the
whole
litigation
will
be
[inaudible]
mr.
william
harbison
thank
you
sir.
