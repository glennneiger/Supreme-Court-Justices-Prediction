mr.
edward
gallagher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
position
of
respondent
is
based
or
rooted
in
the
proposition
that
to
a
large
extent
the
substance
of
this
counterclaim
throughout
of
the
georgia
contract.
it
was
logically
related
to
the
georgia
contract.
and
being
so
logically
related,
it
was
part
of
the
georgia
transaction
or
occurrence
as
those
terms
are
implied
in
the
rule.
this
being
true,
it
was
a
compulsory
counterclaim
in
the
georgia
proceeding.
it
was
injected
by
the
operation
of
the
rule,
it
was
injected
into
the
georgia
proceeding
and
became
part
of
the
issues
in
the
georgia
case.
being
part
of
the
issues,
it
was
adjudicated
there
and
when
an
effort
was
made
at
a
subsequent
date
to
litigate
the
same
claim
in
the
later
tennessee
proceeding
it
was
res
judicata.
now,
there's
been
some
talk
about
or
argument
about
to
what
extent
was
an
attempt
made
to
prove
the
claim
in
the
georgia
case.
according
to
our
interpretation
of
the
rule,
it
is
not
important
to
what
extent
proof
was
submitted
in
support
of
the
claim.
it
is
not
important
whether
it
was
even
ignored.
the
important
thing
is
that
by
the
operation
of
the
compulsory
counterclaim
rule
the
counterclaim
became
part
of
the
issues
in
the
georgia
proceeding
and
therefore
it
was
adjudicated
there
and
it
was
res
judicata
in
the
subsequent
tennessee
case.
mr.
edward
gallagher
in
--
pickard
got
two
verdicts,
one
in
georgia
and
one
in
tennessee.
mr.
edward
gallagher
well,
i
say,
if
your
honor
please,
the
matter
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
primarily.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
gallagher
i
say
that
by
operation
of
the
rule,
it
necessarily
became
part
of
the
issues
in
georgia,
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
gallagher
no,
sir.
but
i
think
the
basic
and
cardinal
principle
of
res
judicata
is
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
actually
proved
but
should
have
improved.
so
that
we
say
that
the
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
no,
sir.
it
has
not.
and
georgia
the
--
the
sequence
of
events
was
that
the
case
was
tried,
the
plaintiff
pickard
obtained
the
verdict.
there
was
a
motion
for
a
verdict
not
--
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
there
was
also
a
judgment
for
a
new
trial
and
both
the
main
case
and
the
counterclaim.
the
court
in
georgia
granted
after
a
reasonable
length
of
time,
granted
the
motion
to
set
aside
the
verdict
which
it
did.
and
it
held
in
abeyance
any
action
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
just
within
the
last
few
weeks
it
has
granted
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
counterclaim.
mr.
edward
gallagher
not
in
georgia,
no,
sir.
mr.
edward
gallagher
well,
in
tennessee
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
a
fine
distinction.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
sir,
there
is.
and
we
are
not
relying
on
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
except
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
no,
sir.
we're
not
relying
in
either
one
of
those.
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
gallagher
no,
sir.
mr.
edward
gallagher
well,
i
say
yes,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
law
it
has
been
passed
upon
in
the
georgia
case.
mr.
edward
gallagher
in
a
georgia
case
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
sir.
i
have
made
--
i
should
probably
have
qualified
my
reply
by
saying
this
that,
in
our
opinion
and
in
our
position
is
that
the
matter
was
passed
upon
during
the
trial,
the
initial
trial
of
the
georgia
case
but
--
and
was
adjudicated
there
for
purposes
of
the
later
tennessee
case.
but
by
the
recent
action
of
the
court
in
granting
a
new
trial
on
the
counterclaim,
now
they
have
another
bite
at
the
apple
in
georgia.
mr.
edward
gallagher
where
we've
said
it
always
belonged
in
the
first
place.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
your
honor.
and
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
that.
there
has
been
some
remark
right
--
during
this
argument
about
the
impossibility
of
collecting
on
the
counterclaim
judgment
if
one
is
secured.
i
think
the
implication
is
that
the
--
that
my
client
is
insolvent.
there's
nothing
whatever
in
this
record
about
the
solvency
of
mr.
pickard.
it
was
never
an
issue,
he
is
not
a
bankrupt.
he
has
never
been
a
receivership.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
regarding
his
financial
condition.
mr.
edward
gallagher
so
that
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
i
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
i
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
the
reason,
if
your
honor
please,
is
this.
there
has
never
been
a
defense
to
the
tennessee
claim
as
indicated
by
the
verdict
of
the
jury
in
tennessee
which
was
for
the
plaintiff.
the
only
defense
that
could
be
created
was
by
splitting
off
a
piece
of
this
georgia
counterclaim,
they
left
most
of
there
but
they
split
off
the
item
that's
now
before
your
honors.
why,
to
create
a
defense
for
the
tennessee
case
that
otherwise
did
not
exist.
if
it
weren't
for
splitting
off,
this
piece
of
the
counterclaim
from
georgia
bringing
it
to
tennessee,
the
tennessee
suit
was
indefensible.
the
jury
held
for
us
in
tennessee,
it
was
only
by
the
action
of
the
judge
in
tennessee.
and
by
reason
of
his
legal
conception
of
what
the
counterclaim
rule
required
that
the
verdict
of
tennessee
was
nullified.
but
to
answer
mr.
justice
black's
question,
the
reason
they
did
not
want
to
litigate
this
particular
item
in
georgia
is
because
they
thought
they
could
use
it
to
better
advantage
in
tennessee.
and
i
may
say
this,
if
your
honor
please,
that
that
is
the
very
verbatim
testimony
of
counsel
for
the
petitioner
here.
he
testified
in
this
case
and
he
testified
that
the
reason
--
that
the
piece
was
split
off
from
georgia
to
be
used
in
tennessee
is
because
he
as
a
lawyer
thought
that
would've
--
it
would
be
to
his
better
advantage
to
use
in
tennessee
as
a
defense.
so
that's
the
answer
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes
your
honor,
that's
correct,
but
may
i
just
say
this?
if
you
--
if
the
wording
of
the
rule,
the
language
of
the
rule
itself
is
examined,
it
completely
supports
the
position
of
the
respondent
here.
the
rule
says
that
the
pleading
must
state
as
a
counterclaim,
any
claim
which
the
pleader
has
at
the
time
that
the
counterclaim
asserted.
in
other
words,
the
rule
says
that
the
date
of
decision
or
the
date
on
which
the
application
of
the
counterclaim
rule
applies
is
the
date
on
which
the
first
complaint
is
filed.
so
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
your
honor
this
--
the
miller
act's
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
but
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
but
only
because
we
were
statutorily
bound
to
it.
mr.
edward
gallagher
in
other
words
--
the
statute
said
that
--
the
stat
--
the
miller
act
says
that
the
suit
shall
be
brought
in
the
federal
district
where
the
work
is
performed
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes.
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
sir.
but
if
may
say
this
your
honor
that's
makes
no
difference
about
the
application
of
the
rule
in
this
case
because
the
application
of
the
rule
had
been
determined
as
of
the
date
of
the
filling
of
the
georgia
complaint
and
so
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
gallagher
certainly.
yes,
your
honor.
that's
right.
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
gallagher
no,
your
honor.
for
this
reason
that
if
the
tennessee
contract
had
been
left
in
the
georgia
proceeding.
in
other
words,
the
operation
of
the
rule
had
been
exhausted
at
the
time
that
the
suit
was
moved
to
tennessee
and
at
the
time
that
the
tennessee
suit
came
along.
the
operation
of
the
rule
is
exhausted
as
of
the
date
on
which
the
first
complaint
is
filed.
whatever
the
situation
is
there
then,
that's
when
it's
determined.
in
other
words,
if
the
counterclaim
was
in
existence
on
the
date
that
the
georgia
complaint
was
filed
as
it
was
and
if
the
counterclaim
had
a
logical
relationship
to
the
georgia
contract
which
it
did
then
the
rule,
then
the
claim
was
compulsory
in
georgia.
now,
let
me
say
one
thing
about
whether
or
not
it
had
a
logical
relationship
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes.
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
gallagher
oh,
yes,
sir,
absolutely,
yes,
sir.
now,
let
me
say
this
about
the
logical
relationship.
there
was
a
$139,000
involved
here,
that
was
the
total
debt.
there
was
one
supplier
who
supplied
both
the
georgia
contract
and
the
tennessee
contract.
the
total
outstanding
debt
was
a
$139,000.
the
104,000
of
that
was
owed
in
georgia
not
tennessee,
in
georgia,
34
in
tennessee
so
that
the
--
it
will
--
that
by
far
the
largest
proportion
of
the
debt
was
it
--
that
was
settled
was
incurred
under
the
georgia
contract.
this
was
natural
because
the
contract
in
georgia
was
$513,000.
the
contract
in
tennessee
was
$50,000.
the
percentages,
in
other
words,
that
were
settled,
this
--
the
percentages
that
were
settled
by
this
payment
of
this
counterclaim
by
him
of
$35,000
was
75
in
georgia,
25
in
tennessee
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
--
so
that
there
is
every
logical
reason
why
this
thing
should
be
looked
--
litigated
in
georgia.
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
gallagher
it's
true.
mr.
edward
gallagher
the
thing
is
though
if
your
honor
please,
there
was
nothing
in
the
rule
that
says
that
the
existence
of
a
dispute
or
the
non-existence
of
a
dispute
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
--
alters
the
normal
application
of
the
rule.
mr.
edward
gallagher
it
does
not
make
an
exception
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
--
for
disputed
claims.
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
gallagher
well,
it
is
true
that
they
say
that
they
disputed
the
georgia
part
of
the
claim.
but
the
--
as
--
according
to
our
view
of
the
case
that
is
not
important
because
the
rule
makes
no
exception
for
disputed
claims.
every
claim
is
disputed,
it's
a
characteristic
of
a
claim
to
have
a
dispute.
in
the
eastport
case
that
the
second
circuit
decided
recently,
that's
cited
in
the
sixth
circuit
opinion,
there
was
a
very
serious
and
bitter
dispute
involved
there.
mr.
edward
gallagher
well,
counterclaim
as
your
honor
knows
is
compulsory
and
permissive
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes.
mr.
edward
gallagher
oh,
i
think
that
would
be
in
line
with
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
rule,
namely
that
the
georgia
court
first
had
jurisdiction
of
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
oh,
well
then,
on
that,
if
your
honor
please,
it's
the
wording
of
the
rule.
the
rule
says,
that
the
counterclaim
shall
be
compulsory
in
the
suit
where
the
first
responsive
pleading
is
served.
so
that
under
the
rule,
the
court
that
had
the
duty
to
pass
on
would
be
the
court
in
which
the
first
suit
was
instituted
on
where
the
first
responsive
pleading
was
served.
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
gallagher
well,
if
may
say
so
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
fundamental
philosophy
of
the
rule
was
to
hold
the
parties
where
they
are
found
when
the
first
litigation
is
instituted
so
that
it
will
not
be
a
considerable
copying,
the
filing
of
a
new
suit
or
the
withholding
of
a
counterclaim
and
so
forth.
they
would
produce
unnecessary
added
litigation
so
the
--
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir.
i
think
they're
entitled
to
have
an
adjudication
in
accordance
with
the
rules.
i
say
that
that
the
--
the
effort
on
their
part
to
transfer
the
adjudication
of
this
particular
counterclaim
to
tennessee
instead
of
leaving
it
in
georgia
where
the
bulk
of
the
debt
arose
in
the
georgia
case
would
be
unfair
to
the
respondent
and
would
be
in
an
illogical
move
because
that
both
of
the
charge
was
--
that
gave
right
to
this
$35,000
arose
out
of
the
georgia
contract.
and
the
--
and
rule
13
(a)
says
that,
if
it
arises
out
of
the
--
if
it
arises
out
of
the
transaction
it's
compulsory.
well,
75%
of
this
transaction
arose
out
of
georgia.
mr.
edward
gallagher
yes,
sir.
and
also
in
addition,
if
your
honor
please,
the
suggestion
contained
in
your
question
that
they
still
haven't
acted
to
the
windward.
they've
got
a
--
this
very
same
counterclaim
now
pending,
currently
pending
in
georgia
which
has
already
reached
the
pretrial
stage
in
georgia.
