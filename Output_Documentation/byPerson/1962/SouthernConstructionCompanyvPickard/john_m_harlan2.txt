justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
an
action
brought
in
finding
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
perhaps
they
haven't
got
any
question
to
be
adjudicated?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
in
tennessee?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
[inaudible]
adjudicated
because
of
rule
13.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
(voice
overlap)
quite
different.
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
are
you
relying
on?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it
was
--
it
was
your
action,
it
was
your
judgment
rightly
or
wrongly
that
instead
of
pursuing
on
everything
down
in
georgia
because
of
the
provisions
of
the
miller
act
you
better
break
up
your
cause
of
action
or
you
though
you
might
have
to
break
them
up
under
the
miller
act
and
bring
your
certain
suit
in
tennessee.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
--
you
were
the
man
--
you
were
the
people
who
were
fragmentizing
this
situation
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
rather
than
the
other
side.
justice
john
m.
harlan
exactly.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
not
blaming
you
on
this
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
has
some
bearing
as
to
whether
this
situation
is
--
fits
within
the
rule
because
the
purpose
of
the
rule
is
surely
to
prevent
fragment
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
fragmentization.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
has
that
bearing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i
thought
the
record
tended
to
indicate
that
when
they
came
to
settle
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
they
didn't
dispute
the
tennessee
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
tennessee
situation
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
but
they
did
dispute
the
georgia
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
situation
and
the
total
amount
paid
was
just
a
little
more
than
what
was
due
under
the
tennessee
situation
and
stated
in
dispute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
true.
therefore,
i
should
think
the
practicality
of
the
situation
would
operate
in
favor
of
tennessee
rather
than
against
georgia,
if
you're
arguing
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
aren't
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
brought
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
brought
this
up
only
because
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
it
was
your
suggestion
that
since
most
of
this
was
allocate
--
allocable
to
georgia
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
georgia
was
the
natural
place
to
assert
it,
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
much
is
he
suing
in
the
court
in
tennessee?
