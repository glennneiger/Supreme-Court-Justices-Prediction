mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
hour
remaining,
counsel
for
the

and
i
have
agreed
to

the
time

mr.
howard
p.

this
case
comes
before
the
court
on
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
under
the
provisions
of
the
criminal
appeal
acts
and
involves
the
construction
of
the
federal
mail
fraud
statute.
prosecution
under
the
mail
fraud
statute
requires
proof
of
two
elements;
first,
a
scheme
and
artifice
to
defraud
and
second,
use
of
the
mails
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
fraudulent
scheme.
this
case
involves
an
issue
dealing
with
the
second
statutory
requirement.
the
specific
question
raised
is
whether
the
mails
were
used
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
particular
scheme
set
forth
in
this
indictment,
in
view
of
the
fact,
that
the
mails
were
used
after
the
moneys
had
been
obtained
by
the
defendants
from
their
so-called
victims.
the
44-count
of
indictments
set
forth
in
the
record
charges
23
individual
defendants
and
the
defendant,
lenders
service
corporation,
the
violations
of
the
mail
fraud
and
conspiracy
statutes.
count
one
of
the
indictment
described
in
some
detail
the
alleged
scheme
and
artifice
to
defraud.
in
brief,
the
count
describes
the
plan
of
the
defendants
to
defraud
small
businessmen
for
entering
and
securing
loans
or
in
selling
their
businesses.
defendants
would
represent
to
take
or
provide
valuable
services
to
assist
these
businessmen
in
return
for
a
fee,
a
portion
of
which
was
to
be
paid
in
advance.
the
indictment
specified
that
in
fact
the
defendants
did
not
intend
to
perform
the
services
contracted
for
and
in
fact
did
not
intend
to
perform
any
services
designed
to
be
valuable
in
assisting
these
businessmen
in
obtaining
their
objectives.
in
order
to
affect
their
scheme,
the
indictment
states
that
the
defendants
organized
three
corporations
including
the
defendant,
lenders
service
corporation,
and
commenced
the
program
of
hiring
and
training
salesmen.
the
indictment
indicates
that
these
salesmen
were
trained
by
the
defendants
in
the
use
of
evasions,
half-truths
and
innuendos.
the
plan
called
for
the
contacting
by
these
salesmen
of
prospects
who
had
expressed
an
interest
in
the
services
of
the
defendants.
the
salesmen
would
then
engage
in
a
personal
interview
of
these
prospects.
throughout
this
personal
interview,
the
indictment
alleges
that
the
salesmen
engaged
in
a
number
of
substantial
false
and
fraudulent
representations.
among
other
things,
the
salesmen
misrepresented
they’re
on
training
and
competence
to
evaluate
the
business
needs
of
the
prospects.
the
salesmen
also
misrepresented
the
facilities
available
to
the
defendants
to
assists
these
small
businessmen
and
would
also
represent
on
occasion
the
interest
rates
and
other
terms
at
which
loans
might
be
made
available
through
the
assistance
of
the
defendants.
the
thrust
of
all
these
misrepresentations
of
course
according
to
the
indictment
was
to
secure
the
signature
of
the
prospect
on
a
--
of
a
document,
on
a
document
called
a
financial
service
agreement.
this
document
in
effect
was
an
application
for
the
services
to
be
provided
by
the
defendants
and
called
for
the
payment
of
a
fee
by
the
applicant.
according
to
the
indictment,
the
next
step
involved
the
acceptance
by
the
defendants
of
these
applications.
according
to
the
indictment,
the
defendants
accepted
these
applications
indiscriminately
so
long
as
the
fee
was
paid
in
cash
and
so
--
or
so
long
as
they
had
been
paid
by
cashier’s
check
which
could
be
transformed
into
cash.
the
indictment
charges
that
this
defendant
accepted
the
application
had
made
no
effort
to
evaluate
such
things
as
the
qualifications
of
the
prospect
or
the
facilities
which
the
defendant
might
in
fact
be
able
to
develop
in
order
to
assist
the
prospect
in
obtaining
the
desired
goal.
according
to
the
indictment,
the
defendants
would
then
mail
a
copy
of
the
accepted
contract
in
a
form
letter
to
the
applicant.
according
to
the
indictment
as
set
forth
at
page
8
of
the
record,
the
defendants
mailed
a
copy
of
the
accepted
contract
and
a
form
letter,
“for
the
purpose
of
lulling
said
victims
by
representing
that
their
applications
had
been
accepted
and
that
the
defendants
would
therefore
perform
for
said
victims
the
valuable
services
which
the
defendants
had
falsely
and
fraudulently
represented
that
they
would
perform.
that
a
further
purpose
thereof
was
to
inform
said
victims
that
they
could
not
obtain
a
refund
of
their
fees
and
that
the
contract
was
not
cancellable
and
that
the
said
victim
was
bound
thereby
and
had
no
recourse
for
retrieving
his
money.”
mr.
howard
p.
willens
mr.
chief
justice,
the
contracts
varied
in
that
respect
and
i’ll
be
addressing
myself
to
that
point
in
a
minute.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
according
to
the
indictment
after
the
mailing
of
this
accepted
contract
and
form
letter,
the
scheme
entailed
a
continued
relationship
between
the
defendants
on
the
one
hand
and
their
victims
on
the
other.
according
to
the
indictment,
the
defendants
after
securing
certain
financial
information
for
their
--
from
various
sources
would
prepare
what
they
call
a
business
and
financial
report
for
submission
to
lending
institutions.
prior
to
the
submission
of
these
reports
to
lending
institutions,
the
indictment
states
that
the
defendants
would
mail
a
proofed
copy
of
this
report
to
the
applicants
for
their
approval.
the
indictment
state
that
in
fact
these
business
and
financial
reports
were
mailed,
but
again
with
no
effort
to
correlate
the
type
or
extent
of
loan
requested
with
the
nature,
type
or
lending
practices
of
any
particular
lending
institution
in
the
relevant
geographical
area.
the
indictment
and
its
description
of
the
fraudulent
scheme
by
alleging
that
on
those
occasions
when
complaints
were
made
by
the
victims
the
defendants
would
pretend
to
investigate
when
complaints
were
made
--
were
made
regarding
misrepresentations
of
the
salesmen,
for
example,
the
indictment
alleges
that
the
defendants
would
contact
the
salesmen
and
encourage
the
particular
salesman
to
deny
that
any
misrepresentations
had
been
made.
at
that
point,
the
defendants
according
to
the
indictment
would
contact
the
victim,
inform
him
of
the
salesmen
denial
and
tell
him
that
for
that
reason
no
portion
of
the
advance
fee
could
be
refunded.
at
this
point
and
throughout,
the
scheme
set
forth
in
this
indictment,
the
defendants
would
continue
to
assure
their
victims
that
valuables
services
had
been
performed
and
would
continue
to
be
performed
by
the
defendants
on
the
applicant’s
behalf.
after
setting
forth
this
scheme
and
artifice
to
defraud,
the
first
43-counts
of
the
indictment
charge
specific
mailings
which
were
said
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
scheme.
the
last
count
of
the
indictment
charges
a
conspiracy
to
use
the
mail
to
defraud
in
violation
of
section
371
of
title
18.
in
the
district
court,
the
defendants
made
four
separate
motions
to
dismiss.
in
response
to
these
motions,
the
government
filed
what
was
called
a
supplemental
brief
which
is
printed
in
the
record
beginning
at
page
37.
this
supplemental
brief
was
subsequently
treated
as
a
bill
of
particulars
by
the
district
court
to
the
extent
it
described
the
mailings
involved.
in
fact,
the
supplemental
brief
did
describe
in
some
detail
the
43
mailings
relied
upon
as
the
basis
for
the
43
substantive
mail
fraud
counts.
in
this
supplemental
brief,
the
government
indicates
that
two
of
the
43
counts
were
based
upon
the
mailings
of
newspaper
advertisements
which
the
defendant
caused
to
be
mailed
in
its
effort
to
secure
the
services
of
salesmen
for
its
enterprise.
seven
of
the
mailings
dealt
with
the
mailings
of
brochures.
a
sample
brochure
was
attached
to
the
supplemental
brief
and
is
printed
at
pages
52
and
53.
this
brochure
was
mailed
by
the
defendants
to
two
prospects
prior
to
the
visit
of
any
salesmen.
the
brochure,
a
sample
of
which
is
in
the
record
is
called
when
our
salesmen
--
when
our
representative
calls
and
it
describes
various
commercial
financing
alternatives
available
to
small
businessmen
and
described
certain
specific
banks
as
correspondent
bank
of
the
defendant.
the
34
remaining
mailings
and
the
one
at
issue
before
this
court
involved
the
mailings
of
the
copies
of
the
accepted
contracts
in
the
accompanied
form
letters
by
the
defendants
to
their
victims
after
the
advance
pay
had
been
secured
by
the
defendant.
a
sample
of
contract
and
form
letter
are
set
forth
in
the
record
at
pages
50
and
51.
as
the
court
will
note
from
the
examination
of
the
contract
set
forth
at
page
51
--
mr.
howard
p.
willens
the
payment
of
the
fee
in
advance
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
in
many
instances,
yes,
but
as
the
court
will
note
from
this
financial
service
agreement
in
the
record
there
is
a
space
left
on
this
contract
in
which
the
salesmen
will
fill
out
a
particular
fee
payment
schedule
pertinent
to
each
transaction.
the
form
provides
a
space
where
the
total
fee
is
to
be
stated
and
whether
arrangements
made
regarding
installment
payments.
so
for
example,
in
this
contract
in
the
record,
a
total
fee
of
$900
is
requested.
that
was
to
be
paid
as
follows,
$200
on
this
date
which
was
the
june
11th,
1958,
the
date
of
the
interview
between
the
salesman
and
the
prospect.
then
it’s
provided
in
this
particular
case
for
a
payment
of
$250
on
or
before
june
20
of
1958,
nine
days
later
and
the
remaining
$450
was
to
be
paid
when
the
loan
is
made.
now
--
mr.
howard
p.
willens
that’s
on
page
51
of
the
record
sir.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
now
--
mr.
howard
p.
willens
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
howard
p.
willens
yes,
sir.
this
is
the
mailing
upon
which
count
three
of
the
indictment
is
based.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
fifth
--
mr.
howard
p.
willens
these
vary
from
transaction
to
transaction.
for
example,
the
vast
majority
of
being
the
contracts
upon
which
these
34
counts
are
based
did
not
provide
for
a
three-payment
installment
as
does
the
sample
in
the
record
rather
they
provided
for
either
payment
of
a
single
installment
totaling
in
advance
or
for
the
payment
of
two
installments,
a
portion
in
advance
at
the
time
of
the
interview
and
the
remainder
when
the
loan
was
made,
as
was
the
case
with
the
third
payment
in
this
transaction
printed
in
the
record.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
no,
mr.
justice
clark.
as
to
all
34
contracts,
the
government
conceded
in
the
district
court,
in
its
supplemental
brief
that
once
the
defendant
secured
the
payment
in
advance
from
their
prospect
or
applicant,
they
did
not
have
any
intention
to
recover
further
moneys
from
the
applicants
for
their
services.
but
the
pertinent
language
in
this
respect
is
set
forth
at
page
38
of
the
record
which
is
a
part
of
a
supplemental
brief.
in
the
last
paragraph
on
that
page,
the
government
is
speaking
of
all
these
34
counts
and
what
it
described
as
split-fee
contract.
as
to
these,
the
government
stated
in
the
district
court
and
i
quote,
“true
it
is
that
the
defendants
allegedly
had
no
intention
of
obtaining
the
loans
sought
by
their
victims
and
might
be
said
therefore
to
have
had
no
intention
of
obtaining
more
money
in
the
form
of
the
other
half
of
the
split
fee”.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
oh,
no
mr.
chief
justice.
at
that
date
he
paid
$200
either
in
a
cashier’s
check
or
by
cash.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
that
--
mr.
howard
p.
willens
according
to
the
scheme
alleging
the
indictment
it’s
the
government’s
position
that
the
defendants
had
no
intention
of
performing
any
bona
fide
services
in
obtaining
loans
for
their
applicants.
so
to
that
extent,
they
had
no
intention
of
completing
the
transaction
on
obtaining
more
moneys
from
their
applicant.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
as
a
matter
of
fact
according
to
this
record
they
did
not
and
we
concede
that
as
to
all
34
counts
the
defendant
did
not
have
intention
to
obtain
further
money.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
there
was
--
i
do
not
believe
any
stipulation
of
fact
of
that
sort
in
the
district
court.
the
defendants
have
recognized
in
their
brief,
of
course,
that
the
supplemental
brief
so
far
as
it
described
the
mailings
was
treated
as
a
bill
of
particulars
by
the
district
court
and
the
government
recognizes
that
the
description
of
the
mailings
in
this
supplemental
brief
is
therefore
binding
upon
the
government.
in
the
district
court,
the
court
denied
three
of
the
four
motions
to
dismiss.
however,
the
court
granted
in
part
that
motion
made
by
the
defendant
to
dismiss
each
and
every
count
of
this
indictment
on
the
ground
that
it
failed
to
state
an
offense
under
the
federal
criminal
laws.
as
to
the
nine
counts
based
upon
the
mailings
of
the
advertisements
and
the
brochures
sent
prior
to
any
visit
of
a
salesman
and
to
obtain
of
any
money,
the
court
held
that
these
did
state
an
offense
under
the
federal
laws.
as
to
these
the
court
said
that
it
could
not
as
a
matter
of
law
hold
that
they
might
not
be
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
scheme
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
since
they
took
place
prior
to
the
obtaining
of
any
moneys.
after
the
34
counts
at
issue
here
however,
the
court
held
differently.
the
court
in
reliance
on
this
court’s
decision
in
the
kann
and
the
parr
cases
held
that
the
moneys
had
been
obtained
and
that
therefore
as
a
matter
of
law
these
mailings
of
the
accepted
contracts
and
form
letters
could
not
be
said
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
scheme.
the
relevant
portion
of
the
district
court’s
opinion
is
on
page
60
of
the
record
where
speaking
of
these
34
counts,
the
district
court
stated,
“it
appears
that
the
mailings
involved
in
the
remaining
counts
of
the
indictment
relate
to
transactions
where
money
had
already
been
obtained
from
the
victims
prior
to
such
mailings.
this
subsequent
use
of
the
mails
under
the
holdings
in
the
parr
and
kann
cases
supra
and
the
case
of
getzer
v.
united
states
were
not
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
scheme.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
district
court
also
dismissed
the
conspiracy
count
without
any
particular
discussion
as
to
its
rationale
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
p.
willens
that’s
correct,
sir.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
that’s
correct,
sir.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
yes,
sir.
they
have
the
conspiracy
count
adjudged
a
violation
of
section
371
and
in
violating
the
mail
fraud
statute
in
the
various
ways
set
forth
in
the
43
substantive
counts
which
in
--
mr.
howard
p.
willens
oh,
that
may
have
been
the
rationale
mr.
justice
goldberg.
of
course,
the
government
contends
that
that
was
not
the
proper
disposition
--
mr.
howard
p.
willens
--
of
the
conspiracy
count,
but
we
assume
that
that
is
why
he
acted
as
he
did.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
no,
it
doesn’t
sir
and
there's
no
discussion.
in
the
district
court
opinion
as
setting
forth
precisely
his
reason
for
dismissing
the
conspiracy
count.
the
government
suggests
that
an
analysis
of
this
court’s
prior
decisions
interpreting
the
mail
fraud
statute
indicate
that
this
particular
question
of
statutory
construction
has
typically
been
resolved
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
we
suggest
that
decisions
of
this
court
have
--
require
first
an
examination
of
the
particular
fraudulent
scheme
set
forth
in
the
indictment,
construed
in
light
of
the
defrauder’s
intent
and
purpose.
and
secondly,
an
examination
of
the
specific
mailing
alleged
to
be
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
scheme.
if
the
mailing
serves
in
some
material
and
substantial
way
to
advance
the
fraudulent
scheme
then
it
is
the
suggestion
of
the
government
that
that
mailing
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
is
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
scheme
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
kann
and
parr
suggest
any
contrary
analysis
nor
do
they
suggest
a
mechanical
rule
based
upon
the
passage
of
money
which
provide
the
substitute
for
a
close
and
particularized
analysis.
in
the
kann
case,
the
fraudulent
scheme
involved
the
efforts
of
the
defendant
to
defraud
a
corporation
called
triumph
explosives
inc.
of
which
they
were
officers
and
directors.
to
this
end,
they
organized
a
second
corporation
called
elk
mills.
the
plan
called
for
the
diversion
of
illegal
profits
through
the
payment
from
elk
mills
to
the
defendants
of
salaries,
bonuses,
and
dividends.
as
the
kann
case
reached
this
court,
two
specific
mailings
were
at
issue.
both
mailings
involved
the
mailings
of
checks
steming
from
two
different
transactions.
one
transaction
involved
the
payment
of
a
check
to
the
defendants
from
a
contractor
in
payment
for
timber
which
the
defendants
had
falsely
represented
belonged
to
them.
the
check
was
taken
by
the
defendants
and
cashed
at
a
local
bank.
the
second
transaction
involved
the
payment
of
a
bonus
payment
from
elk
mills
to
one
of
the
defendants.
again,
the
check
was
taken
and
deposited
to
the
credits
of
one
of
the
defendants
at
a
local
bank.
the
court
held
that
these
mailings
of
two
checks
from
bank
to
bank
were
subsequent
banking
transactions
and
were
incidental
and
collateral
to
the
main
scheme
and
therefore
not
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
fraudulent
scheme
within
the
meaning
of
the
mail
fraud
statute.
since
this
court’s
opinion
in
kann
has
been
relied
upon
by
both
parties
to
this
proceeding
and
an
analysis
of
the
language
of
the
opinion
is
significant
to
a
determination
of
this
issue,
it
might
be
useful
to
quote
that
portion
of
the
kann
case
which
the
government
believes
is
most
useful
in
analyzing
this
case.
the
court
stated
there,
“the
scheme
in
each
case
have
reached
fruition”
--
mr.
howard
p.
willens
pages
94
and
95
of
volume
323.
the
scheme
in
each
case
had
reached
fruition,
the
persons
intended
to
receive
the
money
had
received
it
irrevocably.
it
was
immaterial
to
them
or
to
any
consummation
of
the
scheme,
how
the
bank
which
paid
or
credited
the
check
would
collect
from
the
drawee
bank.
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
mailings
in
question
were
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
scheme
as
the
statute
requires.
the
case
is
to
be
distinguished
from
those
where
the
mails
are
used
prior
to
and
as
one
step
forward,
the
receipt
of
the
first
of
the
fraud
such
as
united
states
v.
kenofskey.
also
to
be
distinguished
are
cases
where
the
use
of
the
mails
as
a
means
of
concealment
so
that
further
fraud
which
are
part
of
the
scheme
may
be
perpetrated.
indeed,
the
mailing
has
ordinarily
had
a
much
closer
relation
to
further
fraudulent
conduct
that
has
the
mere
clearing
of
a
check
although,
it
is
conceivable
that
this
alone
in
some
settings
would
be
enough.
the
federal
mail
fraud
statute
does
not
purport
to
reach
all
frauds
but
only
those
limited
instances
in
which
the
use
of
the
mails
as
a
part
of
the
execution
of
the
fraud
leaving
all
other
cases
to
be
dealt
with
by
appropriate
state
law.
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
parr
case
to
the
extent
that
it
is
relevant
here
is
very
similar.
as
this
court
knows
the
scheme
in
the
parr
case
involved
the
takeover
by
the
defendants
of
a
texas
school
district
and
the
misappropriation
of
a
portion
of
the
revenues
collected
by
that
school
district.
in
the
parr
case,
there
were
three
specific
mailings
which
are
pertinent
to
the
issue
now
before
this
court.
these
mailings
related
to
transactions
in
parr
between
oil
companies
and
the
defendants
whereby
the
defendants
secured
goods
and
services
from
the
oil
companies
through
the
illegal
use
of
the
school
district’s
credit
card.
the
three
mailings
involved,
the
mailing
of
two
invoices
from
oil
companies
to
the
school
district
after
the
goods
and
services
had
been
obtained.
the
third
mailing
involved
the
mailing
of
a
check
from
the
school
district
to
an
oil
company
in
payment
of
such
an
invoice.
but
this
court
held
that
those
three
mailings
between
the
oil
companies
and
the
school
district
were
not
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
total
fraudulent
scheme
as
required
by
the
statute.
in
so
holding
this
court
relied
on
the
language
i
have
quoted
from
kann
and
emphasized
that
the
mailings
there
were
incidental
and
collateral
to
the
main
fraudulent
scheme.
the
government
believes
that
there
are
some
substantial
distinctions
between
the
kann
and
the
parr
cases
on
the
one
hand
and
this
case
on
the
other
which
supports
the
government’s
position
that
the
mailings
set
forth
in
this
indictment
were
for
the
purpose
of
executing
this
particular
fraudulent
scheme.
in
part,
the
government
wishes
to
emphasize
the
functions
which
these
mailings
served
in
relation
to
the
individual
victims
or
the
recipients
of
the
accepted
contract
and
the
form
letters.
secondly,
the
government
wishes
to
emphasize
the
role
that
these
mailings
played
in
the
total
single
scheme
set
forth
in
this
indictment.
with
reference
to
the
(inaudible)
--
mr.
howard
p.
willens
i
hope
--
the
government
believes
mr.
justice
harlan
that
the
bill
of
particulars
and
these
attachments
are
relevant
--
mr.
howard
p.
willens
--
and
part
of
the
record.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
focusing
on
the
individual
defendants
the
government
believes
that
the
copy
of
the
accepted
contract
served
the
very
material
purpose
of
discouraging
the
applicant
from
attempting
to
recover
his
advance
fee
and
therefore
served
in
a
very
meaningful
way
to
enable
the
defendants
to
retain
their
ill
gotten
gains.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
no,
that
--
that’s
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the
government
believes
that
even
with
reference
to
the
individual
victims
the
mailings
here
serves
some
--
mr.
howard
p.
willens
--
substantial
ways
which
serve
to
distinguish
them
--
mr.
howard
p.
willens
--
on
the
mailings
involved
in
kann
and
parr.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
we’d
like
to
emphasize
that
the
mailing
of
this
particular
document
was
planned
from
the
very
outset
of
the
scheme.
it
can
be
seen
from
the
sample
contract
set
forth
in
the
record,
page
51
that
it
provides
as
follows.
this
agreement
shall
become
effective
when
accepted
at
any
regional
office
of
lenders
service
corporation.
notification
of
acceptance
shall
be
made
by
returning
to
applicant
a
copy
of
this
agreement
executed
by
duly
authorized
personnel.
in
the
event,
this
agreement
is
not
accepted
by
lsc,
the
entire
fee
will
be
refunded.
now,
the
government
is
not
here
stressing
the
legal
rights
which
might
be
the
applicant’s
if
in
fact
he
chose
to
go
to
court
to
exercise
such
legal
rights.
rather
we
are
emphasizing
the
practicalities
of
the
situation
as
viewed
from
the
perspective
of
the
gullible
victim
who
already
paid
his
fee
and
a
few
days
later
receives
rather
formidable
legal
document.
we’re
suggesting
that
it’s
not
unreasonable
to
assume
that
such
an
applicant
would
be
discouraged
by
the
receipt
of
this
document
which
informed
him
that
his
advanced
fee
could
not
be
refunded.
we
think
also
though
that
this
single
document
served
a
simultaneous
purpose
of
a
slightly
different
character.
the
document
as
i’ve
noted
specifies
in
rather
general
terms,
certain
services
which
the
defendants
indicate
they
will
perform
on
the
applicant’s
behalf
during
the
continued
relationship
between
the
defendants
and
the
applicant.
to
this
extent
the
document
serves
the
important
purpose
of
assuring
the
applicant
that
in
fact
he
has
not
made
an
unsound
bargain
and
that
perhaps
benefits
will
renowned
resolving
from
the
services
to
be
rendered
on
his
behalf
by
the
defendant.
this
impact
of
the
form
--
of
the
accepted
contract
is
of
course
corroborated
by
the
simultaneous
mailing
of
the
cover
letter,
a
sample
of
which
is
again,
in
the
record.
this
form
letter
ties
the
applicant
for
his
competence
in
the
services
of
the
defendant
and
then
proceeds
to
request
the
applicant
to
take
certain
measures
which
are
designed
to
be
useful
to
the
defendants
in
the
further
services
to
be
performed.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
yes.
example
of
the
form
letter
is
in
the
record
at
page
50
and
as
the
court
will
note
the
form
letter
which
makes
reference
to
five
enclosures.
in
this
letter,
the
defendants
request
the
applicant
to
send
for
of
the
enclosures
to
an
accountant,
a
bank,
and
to
suppliers.
presumably,
these
authorization
cards
will
then
be
used
as
a
means
of
collecting
financial
information
from
these
sources
regarding
the
applicants
of
financial
situation.
now,
the
fifth
enclosure
referred
to
in
this
letter
is
a
personal
history
form
which
the
applicant
has
requested
to
complete
and
return
immediately
so
that
the
defendants
can
perform
their
services
throughout
the
continued
life
of
the
scheme.
you
will
note
that
the
form
letter
makes
reference
to
this
business
and
financial
report
which
is
to
be
compiled
by
the
defendant
and
that
reference
is
made
there
as
in
the
indictment
to
ascending
to
the
applicant
of
a
proofed
copy.
we
suggest
that
these
two
mailings
standout
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
mailings
involved
in
the
kann
case.
in
kann,
we
have
mailings
between
third
parties,
two
banks,
but
were
not
a
party
directly
to
the
fraudulent
scheme.
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
importance
of
these
mailings
is
highlighted
by
the
fact
that
the
mailings
took
place
directly
from
the
defendant
to
the
victims.
moreover,
in
light
of
the
substantial
and
material
way
in
which
these
mailings
served
to
at
once
discouraged
and
assure
the
applicant,
we
think
they
served
a
vital
function
in
the
context
of
this
particular
fraudulent
scheme,
whereas,
the
mailings
in
the
kann
case
were
properly
described
as
incidental
and
collateral
to
the
scheme
there.
throughout
this
court’s
opinion
in
kann
it
was
stressed
that
what
was
involved
was
routine
bank
collection
mailings
and
that
there
was
only
at
stake
there,
the
question
is
to
whether
or
not
the
mere
clearing
of
a
check
which
is
typified
commercial
practice
was
sufficient
to
invoke
the
federal
mail
fraud
statute.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
yes,
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
brennan
and
that
would
deal
as
the
second
important
distinction
between
this
case
on
the
one
hand
and
kann
and
parr
on
the
other
which
supports
the
government’s
position.
because
it
is
clear
that
the
scheme
alleged
in
this
indictment
was
a
single,
elaborate
scheme
structured
so
as
to
permit
the
defendants
to
defraud
a
multitude
of
small
businessmen
who
might
be
attracted
to
its
representations.
the
scheme
--
the
indictment
makes
it
clear
that
the
defendants
here
constructed
the
scheme
to
operate
on
a
national
basis
and
to
reap
the
total
profits
which
could
only
be
gained
by
reaching
as
many
individual
victims
as
possible.
now
we
submit
that
these
mailings
served
an
important
purpose
in
developing
and
enhancing
the
fraudulent
scheme.
these
mailing
served
to
prevent
the
development
of
complaints
from
individual
victims
which
might
conceivably
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
newspapers.
the
courts
or
law
enforcement
officials,
the
end
result
of
these
complaints
from
these
victims
might
bring
a
speedy
end
to
the
fraudulent
scheme
constructed
by
the
defendants.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
it
is
the
contention
of
the
government
that
the
scheme
described
in
this
indictment
is
a
single
scheme
and
artifice
to
defraud.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
i'm
afraid
i
don’t
understand
--
mr.
howard
p.
willens
we
have
44
counts
in
the
entire
indictment,
43
counts
charged
substantive
mail
fraud
offenses.
each
count
incorporates
the
description
of
the
scheme
and
artifice
to
defraud
which
is
set
forth
in
detail
in
the
first
count
and
then
on
each
of
the
43
substantive
mail
fraud
counts
charge
a
specific
mailing
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
p.
willens
it
is
the
--
the
law
under
the
mail
fraud
statute
that
each
offense
constitutes
the
mailing
--
of
a
mailing
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
fraudulent
scheme
and
that
as
such
the
mailing
is
an
individual
offense,
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
contention
is
frequently
raised
in
mail
fraud
cases
by
the
defendants
that
in
fact
the
--
of
the
offense
of
the
mail
fraud
statute
is
a
single
scheme
and
artifice
to
defraud
rather
than
the
affect
in
mailings.
however,
to
date
the
courts
have
held
without
exception
that
this
statute
as
interpreted
makes
the
mailing
as
they
say
the
gist
of
the
offense.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
that
is
correct.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
yes,
mr.
justice
clark.
it
was
conceded
by
counsel
in
the
parr
case
who
represented
the
defendants
that
their
clients
were
guilty
of
constructing
a
scheme
and
artifice
to
defraud.
that
was
conceded
in
parr
and
the
only
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
second
element
of
the
mail
fraud,
a
statute
was
borne
out
that
is
the
use
of
the
mails
for
the
purpose
of
executing
a
fraudulent
scheme.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
no,
mr.
justice
clark
we
don’t
believe
that
necessarily
adds
anything
to
the
mailing
of
the
contract
itself
which
bears
on
its
face
the
signatures
of
the
defendants
and
which
constitutes
an
acceptance
of
this
document.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
well,
it
is
the
government’s
contention,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
in
fact
it
was,
an
integral
part
of
the
transaction
even
with
reference
--
mr.
howard
p.
willens
--
to
the
individual
victim.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
no,
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
--
any
additional
support
that
might
be
gained
from
the
second
paragraph
of
the
form
letter
which
accompanied
the
accepted
--
mr.
howard
p.
willens
--
copy
of
the
contract.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
yes,
mr.

clark.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
yes,
51.
the
financial
service
agreement
is
set
forth
at
page
51
was
an
enclosure
to
the
form
letter
--
mr.
howard
p.
willens
--
as
set
forth
at
50.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
signed
by
the
applicant
and
then
it
was
signed
by
authorized
personnel
at
the
regional
office
of
the
defendants.
in
this
case,
the
regional
office
was
in
atlanta.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
yes,
mr.
justice
clark.
that's
correct.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
yes,
that
was
the
procedure.
typically,
the
--
a
portion
of
the
money
was
paid
in
cash
or
else
it
was
paid
in
check
through
the
salesman.
the
indictment
indicates
that
the
salesman
was
equipped
with
a
rubber
stamp
and
could
quickly
stamp
the
check
as
appropriate
for
certification
so
he
could
get
a
cashier’s
check
as
quickly
as
possible.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
yes.
that
is
correct.
as
in
--
as
the
indictment
had
been
construed
in
light
of
the
bill
of
particulars,
the
government
believes
that
the
defendants
only
intended
to
recover
that
advance
paid
to
the
salesman
and
did
not
intend
to
recover
any
further
money
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
p.
willens
we
so
contend
and
that
you
do
not
have
to
go
further
to
consider
the
impact
of
this
particular
mailing
with
reference
to
the
total
scheme
set
forth
in
the
indictment.
it
has
to
be
emphasized
that
these
prospects
were
told
of
course
as
the
court
recognizes
that
the
moneys
would
be
refunded
in
the
event
the
contract
was
not
accepted.
and
so,
if
the
contract
indicated
an
acceptance
had
not
been
mailed,
there
certainly
is
reason
to
assume
that
there
would’ve
been
the
complaints
from
the
individual
victims
which
the
government
believes
might
well
have
a
brought
an
end
to
this
fraudulent
scheme
with
reference
to
other
victims.
we
suggest
that
the
court
in
the
kann
case
did
have
in
mind
precisely
this
type
of
mailing.
the
court
in
kann
accepted
from
it’s
ruling
those
cases
where
the
mails
were
used
“as
a
means
of
concealment
so
that
further
frauds
which
are
part
of
the
scheme
can
be
perpetrated.
”now,
it’s
clear
that
the
scheme
in
kann
involved
only
a
single
victim
whereas
the
scheme
here
involves
a
large
number
of
victims,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
this
court
or
certainly
in
the
underlying
rationale
which
would
so
limit
this
theory
to
only
those
schemes
involving
single
victims.
to
so
interpret
the
language
or
interpret
the
statute
in
the
government’s
view
were
to
be
unrealistic
or
unrealistically
fragmentized
the
single
scheme
alleging
the
indictment
into
a
multitude
of
individual
schemes
with
reference
to
individual
victims.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
i
think
that
the
government
has
--
chooses
to
state
the
offenses
under
the
statute
only
in
terms
of
individual
mailings.
it
could
have
limited
its
indictment
to
5,
10
or
15
mailings,
in
fact
we
had
alleged
43
mailings
in
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
i
don’t
feel
that
there’s
anything
to
prevent
the
government
from
so
charging
in
its
indictment.
now,
we
suggest
the
government’s
analysis
of
the
statutes
is
consistent
with
this
court’s
opinion
--
opinions
in
kann
and
parr
and
in
addition
we
believe
that
the
analysis
is
supported
by
a
large
number
of
courts
of
appeals’
decision
which
are
cited
in
the
government’s
brief.
many
of
these
decisions
have
involved
fraudulent
schemes
much
more
analogous
to
the
scheme
here
at
bar
than
the
schemes
in
the
kann
and
the
parr
cases.
and
in
such
cases
the
courts
of
appeals
have
applied
the
statute
in
a
way
so
as
to
support
the
government’s
position.
one
such
case
which
might
be
useful
in
illustration
is
a
case
called
clark
v.
united
states
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
cited
at
page
14
of
the
government’s
brief.
in
this
case,
the
defendant
took
money
from
the
victim
and
represented
that
he
would
invest
this
moneys
on
the
victim’s
behalf.
in
fact,
they
did
not
invest
them
on
the
victim’s
behalf,
but
appropriated
the
moneys.
subsequently
he
wrote
letters
to
the
victims
in
which
he
continued
the
representation
that
the
moneys
had
been
invested
on
the
victim’s
behalf
and
it
was
these
mailings
which
were
at
issue
in
the
clark
case.
and
judge
prettyman
in
clark
rejected
the
contention
that
this
court’s
opinion
in
kann
requires
that
once
money
had
passed
hands
the
scheme
terminated
and
then
a
subsequent
mailing
could
not
be
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
scheme.
in
rejecting
that
argument,
judge
prettyman
stated,
the
fallacy
of
this
argument
is
that
the
taking
described
in
the
indictment
was
not
the
bare
taking
of
the
money
and
its
conversion
to
appellant’s
use.
the
scheme
also
included
a
representation
that
the
money
would
be
invested
in
mr.
dixon’s
behalf
with
the
insurance
company.
such
a
scheme
obviously
included
an
understanding
at
some
return
by
way
of
interests
or
dividends
would
be
forthcoming.
it
encompassed
an
intention
not
only
to
convert
the
money
but
also
to
keep
it.
so,
as
to
any
action
on
the
part
of
appellant
which
represented
efforts
on
his
part
to
continue
the
representation
that
the
money
was
invested
and
efforts
by
him
to
keep
the
money
constituted
activities
for
the
purpose
of
executing
such
scheme
or
artifice
or
attempting
so
to
do.
we
think
that
other
decisions
also
demonstrate
the
facts
which
are
relevant
in
interpreting
the
statute
as
applied
to
this
particular
type
of
comprehensive
fraudulent
scheme.
in
any
event,
we
stress
that
the
mailings
here
contrary
to
kann
and
parr
were
between
the
defendant
and
the
victims.
they
were
planned
from
the
outset
as
an
essential
ingredient
of
the
scheme
to
discourage
the
victim
from
recovering
their
money.
they
continued
the
representation
that
valuable
services
would
be
performed
and
they
enabled
the
defendants
to
perpetrate
further
frauds
during
the
course
of
their
continued
and
elaborate
scheme.
we
think
the
district
court
erred
in
ignoring
these
factors
and
stressing
only
the
point
at
which
money
changed
hands
and
then
judgment
should
therefore
be
reversed.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
mr.
chief
justice,
i
just
like
to
take
a
moment
to
correct
a
misunderstanding
that
i
may
have
caused
in
response
to
a
question
from
mr.
justice
goldberg.
you
asked
whether
or
not
the
mailings
might
be
linked
together
in
a
single
count
in
the
government’s
indictment.
and
under
the
present
state
of
the
law
which
is
that
these
mailings
constitutes
an
offense
such
adjoining
of
more
than
one
individual
mailing
would
be
the
[inaudible].
under
the
present
law
it
would
be
a
closer
question
perhaps
if
more
than
one
letter
were
mailed
at
the
same
time
and
in
some
way
could
be
identified
with
each
other
under
the
present
state
of
the
law.
the
government
did
not
address
itself
to
the
conspiracy
count
dismissal
for
several
reasons
and
i’d
like
to
just
mention
now
to
the
court
that
the
arguments
raised
by
the
appellees
here
may
not
really
be
appropriately
before
this
court
under
the
jurisdiction
of
criminal
appeals
act.
in
effect
the
district
court’s
dismissal
of
the
conspiracy
count
could
not
have
been
based
upon
the
district
court’s
rationale
that
every
count
in
this
indictment
was
in
fact
a
conspiracy
count
because
as
counsel
for
appellees
has
indicated
said,
precisely
such
a
motion
was
made
below
in
the
district
court
and
it
was
denied
by
the
district
court.
and
it’s
clear
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
that
an
appeal
by
the
government
is
strictly
limited
and
does
not
open
up
the
entire
case.
in
any
event
we
believe
there’s
no
merit
to
this
contention
because
the
pereira
and
pinkerton
cases
stand
for
the
clear
proposition
that
a
conspiracy
can
be
linked
with
substantive
counts.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
we
really
grant
that
there's
a
similarity
in
substantive
mail
fraud
counts
with
conspiracy
counts
but
we
don’t
think
that
the
similarity
is
particularly
relevant
to
the
issue
now
before
this
court.
mr.
howard
p.
willens
no,
we
think
the
conspiracy
count
was
improperly
been
dismissed.
we
think
the
pereira
case
was
clear
on
this
point,
a
conspiracy
to
use
the
mails
to
defraud
was
a
link
with
a
substantive
mail
fraud
count
and
in
the
count
sustained
such
adjoining
over
the
objections
similar
to
those
being
raised
here
today.
so,
we
think
it’s
clear
that
you
--
the
government
can
join
a
conspiracy
to
use
the
mails
to
defraud
for
substantive
counts
under
the
mail
fraud
statute.
and
as
to
any
prejudice
which
may
have
result
to
the
salesman
or
any
participants
in
a
scheme
or
artifice
we
think
these
are
matters
for
--
of
proof
and
can
--
any
problems
of
prejudice
can
be
certainly
fairly
resolved
by
the
district
court
in
the
exercise
of
his
sound
discretion.
i
would
like
to
mention
also
that
the
appellees
have
stressed
continually
the
offense
of
fraud.
the
mail
fraud
statute
is
not
so
drafted,
it’s
a
scheme
or
artifice
to
defraud
and
this
court
for
many
years
has
emphasized
that
the
statute
is
not
to
be
limited
by
particular
state
definitions
of
the
criminal
offense
of
the
fraud
or
false
pretenses.
as
long
ago
as
1896
in
the
durland
case,
this
court
rejected
precisely
such
a
contention
to
the
effect
that
the
mail
fraud
statute
encompassed
only
the
common
law
offense
of
false
pretenses.
this
court
held
to
the
contrary
instead
the
mail
fraud
statute
was
passed
to
prevent
all
intentional
efforts
to
despoil
and
the
use
of
the
post
office
in
affecting
that
offense.
we
believe
that
therefore
the
offense
stated
here
is
within
the
statute
and
that
the
mails
were
used
for
executing
the
fraudulent
scheme.
