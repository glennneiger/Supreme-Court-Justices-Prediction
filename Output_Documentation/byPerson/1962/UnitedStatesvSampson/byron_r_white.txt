a
matter
of
fact
[inaudible]
--
justice
byron
r.
white
your
position
is
that
it
makes
no
difference
once
the
money
is
received
that
it
was
clearly
contemplated
that
there
would
be
further
mailing.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
connection
with
all
of
the
accounts
that
were
dismissed
you
concede
that
these
mailings
were
within
the
contemplation
of
the
scheme.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
these
the
ones
clear
even
though
all
of
these
other
mailings
were
contemplated
by
the
scheme
in
advance?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
you
base
on
parr
and
kann?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
did
the
mailings?
justice
byron
r.

could
have
[inaudible]?
justice

white
the
defendants
themselves
did
the
[inaudible]?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
execution
of
the
scheme?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
do
you
say
that
they're
not
quite
[inaudible],
that
there
were
--
the
government
alleged
44
schemes
--
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
you
deny
it
--
you
do
not
[inaudible]
one
ongoing
scheme.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
going
to
argue
the
[inaudible]?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
you
apparently
agree
with
the
district
court’s
dismissal?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
–
[inaudible]
i
assume
the
--
your
position
must
be
include
that
the
individual
counts
are
conspiracy
[inaudible]
and
all
of
whom
connected
with
the
conspiracy
[inaudible]
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
authority
for
this
[inaudible]
or
do
you
have
some
other
[inaudible]?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
your
(inaudible)
--
is
it
your
contention
that
the
substantive
counts
for
themselves
conspiracies,
or
do
you
deny
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it’s
--
you
mean,
it
isn’t
relevant
at
all
as
to
whether
or
not
you
can
have
an
additional
conspiracy
count?
