justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
willens,
is
your
argument
double
barreled
that
the
mailings
were
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
scheme
to
avoid
a
particular
victim
and
also
part
and
parcel
of
the
broader
scheme
to
defraud
victims
generally?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
as
i
understood
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
go
ahead.
as
i
understand
it,
the
only
payment
that
the
scheme
contemplated
according
to
the
indictment
was
that
which
was
made
when
the
application
was
signed,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
independently
of
anything
else,
the
acceptance
as
such
and
return
by
mail
of
the
executed
--
of
the
contract
executed
in
atlanta,
the
government
says
was
a
part
of
the
fraudulent
scheme,
so
that
the
mailing
was
part
of
it
and
if
you
prevail
on
that
you
don’t
have
to
go
beyond
that,
is
that
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
on
the
premise
of
the
allegation
that
was
never
contemplated
by
the
alleged
defrauders
that
any
more
money
be
--
would
be
accepted,
all
the
rest
was
a
facade
around
the
central
purpose
of
getting
that
money
and
once
they
got
it,
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
the
fraud
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
thrower,
may
i
ask
was
it
--
i
gather
some
of
this
material,
particularly
that
at
52
and
53,
that
was
--
this
is
material
mailed
before
the
money
was
paid
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
can
i
just
ask
you,
when
you
[inaudible]
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
discussing
it,
are
there
any
counts
that
relate
to
the
--
that
mailing
is
based
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
what
point
was
it
executed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
those
subsequent
events
involved
the
mailings
i
gather
of
the
--
by
the
gas
station
of
the
bill
and
the
return
by
mail
of
the
check.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
don’t
want
to
take
too
much
of
your
time
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
may
i
just
on
this
first
point.
you
see
no
distinction
between
the
facts
that
here
the
subsequent
mailings,
that
is
after
the
payment
of
the
money
whereby
the
defendants
themselves
charged
with
the
fraud
whereas
in
kann
and
then
parr
the
subsequent
mailings
involved
whereby
other
than
the
defendants
themselves,
don’t
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
to
the
facts
to
what
you
answered
me
before
that
the
real
objective
of
the
fraud
was
to
get
this
money
and
once
they
had
it
the
fraud
was
executed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
the
only
basis
on
which
--
the
only
basis
stated
in
the
motion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
must
be
on
the
premise
as
mr.
justice
white
has
said
that
what's
--
are
already
pending
without
the
conspiracy
count
are
themselves,
conspiracy
count
scheme.
