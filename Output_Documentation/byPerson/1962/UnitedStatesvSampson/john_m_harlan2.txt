justice
john
m.
harlan
what
did
you
mean
by
advance
fee,
the
payment
of
the
fee
in
advance
or
payment
on
account
or
(inaudible)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
the
total
fee
in
advance?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
page
is
that
on?
justice
john
m.
harlan
51.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
district
court
also
dismiss
the
conspiracy
count?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
on
top
of
the
34
counts
you’re
talking
about?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
there
are
35
counts
that
were
dismissed
in
total?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
is
that
all
together
clear
because
he
also
--
the
conspiracy
count
also
included
substantive
offenses
which
the
district
court
held
were
sufficient.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
the
rationale
doesn’t
necessarily
follow,
does
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
in
judging
this
case
do
we
--
are
we
limited
to
the
allegations
of
the
indictment
or
can
we
also
take
into
account
these
exhibits?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
these
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
bill
of
particular,
they’re
not
exhibits
in
the
[inaudible]?
