mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
thrower.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
yes.
we
would
like
initially
to
call
to
the
court’s
attention
that
our
brief
raises
three
major
issues
with
respect
to
this
appeal
but
only
one
of
which
was
touched
by
the
argument
of
mr.
willens.
i
will
undertake
to
cover
the
argument
which
he
covered;
the
portion
of
the
issues
covered
by
him
and
then
proceed
to
the
other
two
issues.
there
is
of
course
here
no
question
on
our
part
but
that
the
indictment
if
true
and
it
is
denied
by
the
defendants,
but
if
the
indictment
is
true,
charges
a
fraud,
charges
wrongful
conduct
by
which
we
would
not
undertake
to
defend.
that
is
not
the
issue
here.
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
indictment
charges
a
federal
offense.
i
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
counsel,
mr.
willens
correctly
states
the
statutory
test
which
requires
that
the
mailing
be
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
scheme
or
artifice
to
defraud
or
obtain
money
by
false
pretenses
or
attempting
so
to
do.
but
in
his
brief,
the
government
quickly
departs
from
this
statutory
test
and
the
statutory
language
which
is
language
of
limitations
and
restrictions
and
goes
to
the
broadest
kind
of
language
such
as
mailings
which
advanced
the
plan
or
advanced
the
plot,
mailings
as
part
of
a
long
range
preparations
and
the
like.
and
by
substituting
here,
this
broader
language
for
the
narrower
restrictive
language
of
a
statute
perhaps
in
1872,
we
feel
that
the
government
here
seeks
to
extend
this
coverage
of
statute
in
both
directions
to
extend
it
in
one
direction,
to
cover
mailings
which
are
purely
preliminary
and
to
extend
it
in
the
other
direction
or
to
cover
mailings
which
follow
the
execution
of
the
offense.
we
believe
that
the
issue
is
squarely
covered
by
the
decisions
at
the
issue
as
to
the
subsequent
mailing
just
squarely
covered
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
kann
versus
united
states,
a
position
that
was
reaffirmed
and
reasserted
only
for
a
couple
of
years
ago
in
parr
versus
the
united
states.
i
think
that
mr.
willens
have
given
a
best
statement
of
the
facts
of
this
case
as
alleged.
we
take
--
we’d
wish
to
comment
only
about
the
lack
of
clarity
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
all
of
the
money
which
was
expected
to
be
received
by
the
defendants
was
received
before
the
mailings
involved
in
the
first
issue
which
we
are
discussing.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
that
your
honor
executed
the
offensive
fraud
and
as
this
court
stated
within
it’s
holding
within
the
very
holding
in
kann
--
in
the
kann
case
that
executed
the
scheme
or
artifice
to
obtain
money
by
false
pretenses.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
your
honor
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
we
would
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
i
think
that
the
--
our
position
would
be
that
the
underlying
offense
of
fraud
has
been
committed,
the
state
offense,
the
crime
of
fraud
has
been
committed
and
when
the
proceeds
when
the
fruits
had
been
received
and
that
the
fraud
has
been
executed.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
according
to
the
allegations,
yes.
i
might
review
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
oh,
we
do
not
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
--
we
take
the
issue
with
the
fact
that
it
was
contemplated
that
there
would
be
further
mailing.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
we
would
concede
that,
yes.
there
would
be
no
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
yes,
if
i
may
come
to
that
subject
--
yes,
that
would
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
[inaudible]
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
seven
of
the
accounts
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
--
not
dismissed
by
the
district
court
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
--
related
to
that
mailing
and
it
was
because
of
that
that
the
court
did
not
dismiss
it.
we
will
argue
that
the
court
erred
in
that.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
but
with
respect
to
the
subsequent
mailings
our
position
is
that
the
reference
to
the
scheme
or
artifice
to
obtain
money
by
false
pretenses
stated
within
the
statute
refers
to
the
offense
of
fraud
or
obtaining
money
by
false
pretenses
that
that
offense
is
committed
finally
and
irrevocably
when
the
wrong
doer
receives
all
of
the
money
which
he
is
seeking
and
which
he
expects
to
get.
and
that
therefore,
the
fraud
is
executed
and
that
the
scheme
or
artifice
as
discussed
--
as
stated
in
this
statute
is
also
executed.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
they
may
be
related.
we
don’t
take
issue
with
the
fact
that
they
maybe
related.
our
point
is
that
the
offense
of
fraud
was
executed
when
the
proceeds
of
the
fraud
were
received.
we
believed
it
was
precisely
that.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
on
parr
and
kann
and
i
would
like
to
discuss
those
cases
to
the
extent
of
pointing
out
that
that
was
a
clear
holding
of
each
of
those
cases.
i
may
say
incidentally
when
you
referred
to
paul,
we’re
referring
to
the
action
of
the
court
on
counts
17,
18
and
19.
they
are
not
to
the
counts
involving
the
legally
compelled
mailings.
in
the
kann
case,
as
counsel
has
pointed
out
there
were
two
mailings
of
checks.
one
check
was
received
by
a
subsidiary
of
the
victim
corporation.
it
was
endorsed
and
deposited
for
credit.
the
other
check
was
received
from
an
innocent
contractor.
he
was
an
innocent
intermediary
who
gave
a
check
to
the
defendants
for
$12,000
and
was
then
to
bill
the
ultimate
victim
for
that
amount
of
$12,000
and
this
other
check
clearly,
it
was
most
important
to
the
defendants
that
there
be
a
smooth
clearance
of
that
check
because
there
then
followed
a
subsequent
activity
which
was
the
billing
of
the
$12,000
to
the
ultimate
victim
whereupon
the
defendants
would
use
their
offices
within
the
corporation
to
see
that
the
check
was
paid
without
disturbance.
it
cannot
be
said
here
that
subsequent
mailings
were
not
within
their
contemplation.
it
cannot
be
said
here
that
subsequent
mailings
were
not
extremely
important
to
the
security
of
the
defendants.
in
fact,
it
would
appear
that
the
subsequent
mailings
there
were
of
much
greater
concern
to
the
security
of
the
defendants
than
were
the
subsequent
mailings
here.
the
dissent
in
that
case
as
i
understand
was
based
upon
the
fact
that
those
mailings
were
somewhat
tentative
because
the
burden
did
not
fall
back
upon
the
victim
until
the
checks
had
cleared.
in
the
case
of
the
check
from
the
intermediary,
the
contract
--
it’s
not
--
and
he
indicated
that
the
ultimate
victim
had
in
any
way
had
sent
it
to
the
transaction
and
that
the
billing
was
yet
to
be
made
to
the
ultimate
victim.
what
the
court
pointed
out
in
that
case?
well
first,
an
issue
was
raised
as
to
whether
the
defendants
had
received
irrevocably
the
fruits
of
the
fraud
because
of
the
tentative
nature
which
i
pointed
to.
the
majority
held
however,
that
once
those
checks
were
deposited
and
a
credit
was
received
or
cash
was
received
that
the
payment
could
not
be
stopped
and
that
the
fruits
of
the
fraud
had
been
irrevocably
received.
and
therefore,
subsequent
mailings
were
incidental,
irrelevant
really
to
the
fact
that
a
crime
of
fraud
had
been
committed
and
the
court
in
its
very
holding
pointed
out,
we
hold
therefore
that
one
element
of
the
offense
defined
by
this
statute
namely
that
the
mailing
must
be
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
fraud
is
lacking
in
the
present
case.
and
we
think
that
squarely
covers
this
case.
it
was
alleged
as
is
indicated
in
the
argument
set
in
–
digested
proceeding
the
opinion
that
the
government
argued
that
this
was
a
continuing
scheme,
there
wasn’t
any
question
about
that.
there
was
a
very
elaborate
continuing
scheme
intended
apparently
to
go
on
indefinitely
where
the
officers,
certain
officers
and
others
in
a
corporation
were
to
defraud
a
corporation
which
they
control
by
diverting
--
diverting
a
portion
of
its
earnings
and
profits
to
a
subsidiary
and
then
draining
money
out
of
this
subsidiary
in
one
way
or
another.
there’s
no
question,
but
that
a
detection,
a
discovery
with
respect
to
one
transaction
would
have
blown
up
the
whole
deal.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
that
is
our
position
exactly
with
respect
to
the
mailings
here.
now,
the
parr
case
is
probably
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
mr.
chief
justice,
to
bring
a
conspiracy
within
the
coverage
of
this
statute,
it
must
be
shown
that
they
conspired
to
use
the
mails
to
defraud.
i
think
that
the
government
would
acknowledge
that
unless
a
use
of
the
mails
to
defraud
is
shown
in
some
substantive
count
that
they
have
not
alleged
and
intend
to
use
the
mails
to
defraud
so
that
the
conspiracy
count
would
fall.
the
mere
fact
that
in
conjunction
with
the
broad
range
conspiracy
of
one
of
the
overt
acts
may
contemplate
the
use
of
the
mails
would
not
bring
that
within
the
mail
fraud
statute
unless
that
use
of
the
mails
were
in
execution
of
defraud
or
in
attempting
so
to
do.
so
that
if
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
i
beg
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
well,
that
depends
upon
what
statute
intends
to
refer
to
when
it
uses
the
ten
--
the
term
scheme
or
artifice.
i
think
when
it
uses
the
term
scheme
that
could
possibly
be
construed
to
be
broad
or
narrow.
when
it
uses
the
term
artifice
however,
i
think
it
is
indicating
as
the
court
held
in
kann
that
it
is
talking
about
a
particular
transaction
of
fraud
and
not
a
long
range
of
plan
of
operations
which
may
contemplate
fraud.
the
very
argument
that
you
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
was
made
to
the
court
in
the
kann
case
and
the
court
replied
to
that
that
it
must
look
at
the
matter
in
transaction
by
transaction,
that
is
fraud
by
fraud
and
artifice
by
artifice
and
the
question
was
as
to
whether
in
the
execution
of
any
fraud
to
obtain
money
by
false
pretenses,
the
crime,
the
offense
rather,
the
underlying
wrong
and
offense
of
obtaining
the
money
by
false
pretenses,
there
was
a
use
of
the
mails
that
the
scheme
or
artifice
as
referred
to
does
not
extend
to
a
long
range
plan
of
operations.
we
recognize
that
that
is
the
government’s
position
here.
we
think
it
is
squarely
contrary
to
kann
and
is
--
i
only
wish
to
say
squarely
contrary
to
parr.
we
--
of
course,
it
is
unnecessary
to
call
to
the
court’s
attention
the
fact
that
this
is
a
criminal
statute,
that
it
should
be
strictly
construed
even
if
there
were
some
ambiguity
within
the
statute
on
that,
it
should
be
decided
in
favor
of
the
accused.
and
this
point,
we
say,
has
been
decided
by
this
court
on
two
occasions
in
the
kann
case
and
again
in
the
parr
case.
the
parr
case
perhaps
is
even
clearer,
even
more
conclusive
if
that
were
possible
on
this
particular
point.
there
it
was
charged
in
count
17,
18
and
19
that
the
accused
using
wrongfully
a
charge
account
of
the
school
district
of
the
particular
district
in
texas
had
obtained
gas
and
oil
and
services
from
a
gas
station.
subsequent
to
their
obtaining
the
gas
and
oil
of
course,
the
gas
station
billed
the
school
district
which
the
defendants
controlled
and
by
reason
of
their
control
they
had
the
school
district
pay
those
checks.
now,
of
course
what
happened
subsequent
to
their
getting
the
gas
and
all
was
of
great
moment
so
far
as
the
security
of
the
accused,
the
defendants
were
concerned.
that
was
the
critical
thing.
the
smooth
clearance
of
the
bills
through
the
school
district
and
the
sending
of
checks
back,
but
the
court
held
there
relying
again
on
the
kann
case
that
the
fraud
was
executed.
the
offense
of
fraud
was
committed
irrevocably.
there
was
no
point
thereafter
of
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
it
was
executed
when
they
wrongfully
obtained
and
converted
to
their
possession
the
gas
and
the
oil
and
the
services
even
though
it
remained
later
for
the
burden
to
fall,
through
their
efforts
and
according
with
--
to
their
plans
upon
the
school
district.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
controlled
by
the
kann
case
and
that
those
mailings
was
not
a
part
of
the
execution
of
the
fraud.
it
seems
to
us
to
cover
the
matter
very
clearly.
now,
they
[inaudible]
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
well,
i
think
it
was
--
i
think
it
was
very
--
i
think
your
honor
that
it
was
apparent
from
the
face
of
the
transaction
that
the
sending
of
the
bill
and
the
return
of
the
check
was
essential
to
the
concealment
of
the
transaction
because
it
had
to
be
cleared
through
the
books
and
the
payment
office
of
the
school
district
as
a
normal
and
routine
business
expense
of
the
school
district.
i
have
reviewed
the
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
well,
it
was
essential
that
it
be
concealed
that
the
school
district
would
not
--
could
not
pay
their
personal
gas
and
oil
expenses.
it
had
to
be
concealed
in
the
running
of
it
through
the
books
as
a
business
expense
of
the
school
district.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
the
mailing
was
done
by
the
--
first
by
the
gas
company
and
then
it
was
done
by
the
school
district
which
was
controlled
by
the
defendants.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
they
--
alright,
to
the
extent
that
they
controlled
the
school
district,
they
did
the
mailing
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
--
to
the
extent
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
the
bank
did
the
mailing.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
yes.
now,
let
me
point
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
i
think
your
honor
that
what
is
referred
to
there
are
mailings
subsequent
to
one
fraud
which
a
part
of
the
execution
and
contribute
to
the
execution
of
a
further
fraud.
for
example,
in
the
cases
that
are
cited
under
that
point
that
are
referred
to
in
our
brief
where
there
is
a
continuing
fraud
against
a
single
victim
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
--
a
mailing
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
a
mailing
may
lull
that
victim
so
as
to
persuade
in
to
invest
more
money
in
the
enterprise.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
where
there
have
been
cases
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
yes.
there
have
been
cases,
your
honor,
where
one
victim
is
used
in
order
to
effect
a
fraud
upon
a
second
victim,
but
the
argument
that
the
government
makes
here
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
see
the
distinction.
the
argument
that
the
government
makes
here
in
effect
is
that
these
mailings
prevented
the
defendants
from
being
arrested
and
therefore,
left
them
that
liberty
to
affect
other
frauds
upon
other
people.
that
argument
was
not
what
was
accepted
in
kann
and
that
is
not
the
exception
that
was
made
in
kann
because
clearly
there,
if
the
earlier
transaction
of
fraud
upon
the
ultimate
victim,
the
triumph
corporation
had
been
revealed,
the
whole
thing
would’ve
blown
up
and
there
would’ve
been
no
fraud.
likewise
in
the
parr
case,
if
one
transaction
were
revealed,
of
course
it
would
have
blown
up
and
there
would
have
been
no
more.
what
the
court
is
referring
to
is
where
one
mailing
contributes
to
the
execution
of
a
later
fraud.
another
example
of
that,
cited
--
which
is
given
involved
in
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
solicitor
here
is
where
a
loan
had
been
made
from
a
bank
putting
up
securities.
there
was
a
mailing
subsequent
to
the
date
of
that
loan,
but
the
court,
this
was
corbett
versus
united
states,
the
court
made
it
very
clear
that
that
contributed
to
the
inducing
of
the
bank
to
make
further
loans
upon
--
for
its
bonds
and
that
it
was
part
of
the
effort
to
get
further
loans.
but
it
would
not
cover
a
situation
where
the
concealment
merely
prevents
arrest,
arrest
and
leaves
the
defendant
free
to
commit
other
frauds.
there
is
no
allegation
in
this
indictment
that
the
performance
in
one
case
had
anything,
any
relation
whatsoever
to
a
sale
in
another
situation.
and
in
fact,
a
reading
of
the
full
indictment
would
indicate
that
these
were
separate,
independent
and
unrelated
transactions.
again,
i
would
say
not
nearly
so
closely
related
as
in
kann
and
parr
where
a
failure
to
conceal
one
transaction
would
of
course
had
terminated
as
to
other.
if
i
may
proceed,
i
think
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
congress
has
on
many
occasions
passed
statutes
with
--
which
deal
with
the
matter
of
concealment
after
the
execution
of
a
crime.
this
court
has
also
on
several
occasions
as
we
note
in
our
brief
concerned
itself
with
the
claim
that
concealment
after
the
commission
of
a
crime
is
a
part
of
the
crime
itself.
and
it
has
consistently
held
and
indicated
in
dicta
that
concealment
is
not
a
part
of
the
execution
of
the
offense
itself.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
may
it
please
your
honor,
i
would
answer
that
by
saying
that
there
is
no
federal
statute
which
makes
it
a
federal
offense
to
conspire
to
defraud
nor
is
there
a
federal
statute
which
makes
it
an
offense
to
mail
letters
that
are
related
to
such
a
conspiracy.
the
only
federal
statute
is
one
that
makes
it
a
federal
offense
to
use
the
mails
in
the
execution
of
the
offense
of
fraud
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
and
this
court
held
in
the
kann
case
and
the
execution
of
fraud.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
well
this
court,
there
was
a
scheme
in
kann
and
in
parr
which
was
a
continuing
scheme
and
this
court
held
that
the
terms
scheme
or
artifice
as
referred
to
in
kann
and
parr
met
the
particular
transaction.
if
it
referred,
if
your
honor,
it
refers
to
a
single
scheme,
i
think
then
that
the
comment
of
--
comments
of
mr.
justice
goldberg
i
believe
and
mr.
justice
brennan
would
be
pertinent
that
there
could
be
simply
--
there
could
be
one
offense.
we
do
not
acknowledge
that
there
could
be
indictments
for
multiple
mailings
for
one
offense.
the
cases
which
have
held
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
yes,
yes.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
we
concede
--
the
question
is,
what
is
the
statute
referring
to,
words
or
scheme
or
artifice
to
obtain
money
by
false
pretenses?
this
court
held
in
kann
that
that
is
a
reference
to
a
single
transaction
of
fraud.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
well,
i
hope
to
your
honor
and
i
have
an
intermediate
point
which
i
will
have
to
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
yes.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
we
see
no
distinction.
the
courts
have
held
many,
many,
many
times
that
the
statute
refers
to
mailings
done
or
mailings
caused
and
there
would
be
no
question
but
if
there
were
a
routine
clearance
of
a
check
preliminary
to
the
receipt
of
the
money
that
that
would
be
covered.
the
courts
have
held
that
many
times,
the
question
here
is
solely
whether
this
comes
after
the
execution
of
the
fraud
and
we
say
here
as
to
a
criminal
statute
that
if
this
statute
is
opened
up
under
the
vague
terminology
that
had
been
suggested
in
the
brief
that
there
is
no
ending
of
the
extension
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
excuse
me
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
now,
let
me
refer
to
the
preliminary
mailings.
i
think
if
i
may
simply
say
this.
the
statute
refers
to
for
the
purpose
of
executing
the
fraud
or
attempting
to
do
so.
this
statute
has
historically
been
known
and
treated
as
the
mail
fraud
statute.
the
use
of
the
mails
to
commit
a
fraud
or
the
use
of
the
mails
in
an
attempt
to
commit
a
fraud
and
mailings
which
are
purely
preliminary
and
have
not
reached
the
level
of
an
attempt
we
think
are
not
covered
by
the
statute.
we
note
that
mr.
miller,
head
of
the
criminal
division
in
the
department
of
justice,
assistant
attorney
general
miller
in
testimony
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee
was
asked
whether
he
wanted
the
1961
anti
--
antiracketeering
statutes
extended
to
include
fraud.
if
fraud
had
been
included
then
there
would
be
no
question
but
that
any
mailing
in
the
course
of
unlawful
--
in
the
course
of
a
business
having
as
its
objective
fraud
would
be
covered.
but
he
expressly
declined
that
and
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
he
declined
there
to
accept
the
jurisdiction
which
your
question
would
tend
to
give
it
here.
that
is
any
mailing
in
the
course
of
an
unlawful
business
in
the
mailing
of
fraud
--
in
the
mailing
in
the
course
or
any
transportation
across
state
lines
in
the
course
of
an
unlawful
business
would
have
been
covered
and
these
preliminary
mailings
would
have
been
covered,
the
subsequent
mailings
would
unquestionably
have
been
covered
if
he
had
accepted
the
jurisdiction
which
one
of
the
senators
suggested
might
be
given
by
including
fraud
within
the
antiracketeering
statute
of
1961.
he
said
that
this
would
be
a
major
expansion
or
a
jurisdiction
which
would
burden
both
on
the
prosecuting
and
on
investigative
staffs
and
we
feel
that
the
government
is
seeking
here
through
this
indictment
and
under
a
restrictive
statute
which
this
court
has
held
to
be
limited
and
restricted
is
seeking
to
get
the
jurisdiction
of
that
it
declined
there.
now,
if
i
may
move
quickly
and
in
closing
to
the
point
involving
the
conspiracy.
this
third
point
does
not
arise
of
course
unless
the
court
finds
and
we
would
regret
if
it
did
so,
unless
the
court
found
--
finds
that
these
so-called
substantive
counts
charged
a
federal
offense.
we
argued
in
support
of
a
motion
before
the
district
court
that
every
count,
every
so-called
substantive
count
in
the
indictment
actually
was
a
conspiracy
no
matter
what
it
was
called
and
that
therefore,
each
of
the
substantive
counts
was
duplicative
of
each
of
the
others
and
that
the
conspiracy
count
was
duplicative
of
them
all.
we
believe
that
it
was
in
response
to
that
that
the
district
court
dismissed
the
conspiracy
count.
we
believe
that
that
is
the
least
that
it
could
have
done,
that
it
might
proffer
or
have
required
the
government
to
stand
on
one
count
and
to
dismiss
all
of
the
others.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
it
paid
no
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
--
comment
about
it.
it
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
left
it
to
us
to
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
except
for
the
dismissal
it
said
nothing
further,
it
did
not
explain.
however,
the
motion
was
made
to
dismiss
it
on
the
ground
that
it
was
duplicative
of
the
substantive
counts.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
there
was
the
further
basis
that
the
--
a
further
argument,
that
not
of
the
substantive
counts
alleged
federal
expense
but
presumably,
it
did
not
move
on
that
basis
because
it
upheld
some
of
the
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
so,
we
have
assumed
that
it
was
on
that
basis.
i
think
that
is
their
assumption.
let
me
call
your
attention
to
the
length
of
the
indictment
here.
it
indicates
the
charge
of
a
conspiracy
or
as
the
chief
justice
has
indicated
it
extended
over
a
period
of
more
than
three
years
involving
three
corporations
and
three
individuals
and
–
23
individuals.
some
of
them
were
employed
the
principals
who
were
employed
all
of
the
time
and
some
of
them
were
employed
a
part
of
the
time.
it
was
a
conspiracy
alleged
to
defraud
46
named
persons
and
as
the
indictment
says
a
numerous
and
diverse
other
persons
throughout
the
united
states.
the
use
of
the
mails
--
the
intent
to
use
the
mails
was
alleged
to
be
a
part
of
the
plan
and
of
the
conspiracy.
the
indictment
does
not
charge
that
one
defendant
mailed
or
any
particular
defendants
mailed
and
that
other
defendants
aided
and
abetted.
the
indictment
charges
that
all
defendants
mailed.
all
of
these
facts
are
charged
as
a
part
of
each
one
of
the
substantive
counts
and
all
of
these
defendants
are
named
in
each
of
these
substantive
counts.
we
believe
that
it
is
apparent
from
a
reading
of
the
entire
indictment,
this
total
charge
encompassing
all
of
the
defendants
as
a
group
in
each
substantive
count
that
in
reality
there
is
in
each
substantive
count,
the
charge
of
a
conspiracy.
there
is
not
the
slightest
indication
within
any
substantive
count
that
any
individual
is
included
by
reason
of
his
direct
activity
in
doing
something
or
by
--
or
under
the
principle
statute
as
aiding,
abetting,
counseling,
commanding
or
procuring.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
well,
i
think
that
reference
to
the
salesmen
best
illustrates
the
scope
of
this
charge
because
it’s
indicated
that
the
salesmen
had
a
limited
function.
he
went
out
to
make
a
sale
or
actually
the
--
it
alleged
that
the
major
moving
misrepresentations
inducing
the
payment
of
money
was
in
a
personal
interview.
he
worked
in
an
area.
he
was
an
employee,
he
was
in
the
conspiracy,
we
grant
it,
no
question
about
that,
but
he
was
an
employee
at
a
low
level
within
the
conspiracy.
it
would
appear
that
he
did
not
participate
in
the
overall
planning
because
others
are
alleged
to
be
the
principle
directors
of
the
alleged
conspiracy.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
well
--
well,
that
is
true.
i
said
your
honor
that
he
was
not
at
the
decision
or
level.
it
is
alleged
that
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
yes,
yes.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
there
was
no
--
and
your
honor,
we
recognize
that
each
of
the
salesmen
maybe
indicted
as
a
part
of
this
total
conspiracy.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
we
are
questioning
whether
each
salesman
can
be
included
within
each
substantive
offense.
we
take
the
position
for
example
that
a
salesman
in
miami
no
more
committed
a
substantive
offense
of
fraud
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
california
when
there
was
a
sale
in
california
and
no
more
committed
a
substantive
offense
of
a
mailing
in
connection
with
that
fraud
in
california
than
a
truck
driver
who
might
be
employed
to
drive
all
untaxed
whiskey
in
chicago
being
employed
by
a
national
syndicate
is
guilty
of
the
substantive
offense
of
hauling
untaxed
whiskey
in
new
york
or
in
miami.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
well,
we
think
this
is
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
indictment,
your
honor.
and
we
think
that
a
tremendous
--
we
think
this
is
a
very
dangerous
tactical
weapon
which
is
given
to
the
prosecutor
if
it
is
permitted
to
stand
here.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
the
possibility
of
an
individual
defense
is
completely,
that
is
by
an
individual
at
a
lower
level
is
completely
stomped
out
if
the
principle
of
vicarious
responsibility
for
substantive
offenses
is
carried
this
far.
we
believe
the
effect
of
the
case
probably
reaches
to
the
outer
limits
and
define
the
outer
limits
of
vicarious
liability
for
a
substantive
offense.
but
that
case
as
we
understand
it
would
not
approach
this
situation.
there,
as
the
court
pointed
out
the
particular
individual
making
the
appeal
was
at
a
decisional
level.
he
was
truly
a
partner
in
the
crime.
he
shared
in
the
planning
of
the
total
conspiracy
and
presumably
also
in
the
benefits
if
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
true,
your
honor.
but
if
the
salesman
in
miami
have
a
part
in
the
substantive
offense
that
might
be
committed
in
the
state
of
california
or
in
chicago
or
new
york
or
kentucky?
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
then,
that
gives
the
question
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
they
--
well,
we
would
acknowledge
too
that
the
salesman
could
be
indicted
to
participate
for
the
participation
in
the
substantive
offense
where
he
made
the
sale.
we
do
not
question
here
what
the
nature,
the
dragnet
as
this
court
has
often
mentioned,
the
dragnet
in
this
indictment
is
that
everybody,
all
salesmen
are
indicted
with
respect
to
every
substantive
offense.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
well
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
well,
my
argument
would
indicate
that
each
of
the
substantive
counts
is
in
reality
a
conspiracy
count
drawn
as
such
encompassing
everyone
in
every
substantive
offense
so
that
the
so-called
substantive
offense
is
really
--
there
were
43
conspiracies,
each
naming
a
particular
overt
act
and
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
we
would
recognize
that
one
of
those
counts
is
a
good
count
if
any
one
of
them
faced
a
conspiracy
to
use
the
mails
and
--
for
the
purpose
of
executing.
but
we
think
that
the
district
court
had
a
certain
discretion
in
the
treatment
of
this
particular
issue.
we
think
the
district
court
should
have
dismissed
all
counts
but
one.
but
certainly
at
the
least,
it
should
--
it’s
discretion
in
dismissing
--
its
action
in
dismissing
the
conspiracy
count
should
not
be
distinct
--
disturbed
because
it
concluded
that
the
conspiracy
count
was
merely
duplicative
of
the
other
count.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
oh,
yes.
we
--
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
well,
we
think
that
would
be
the
result.
yes,
your
honor.
we
would
see
that
if
this
court
went
into
the
matter
fully
it
might
well
direct
the
district
court
to
do
what
we
asked
it
to
do
to
dismiss
all
of
these
counts
but
one.
but
at
the
least,
we
think
this
court
should
leave
in
fairness
and
proper
administration
of
criminal
trials
in
the
federal
courts
that
at
the
least
this
court
should
leave
the
district
court’s
dismissal
of
the
conspiracy
count
undisturbed.
we
would
like
--
very
much
the
courts
to
go
further
into
the
issue.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
yes.
this
point
would
not
be
raised
unless
we
have
been
unsuccessful
on
either
the
first
or
the
second
issue
that
we
raise
and
i
do
not
want
to
indicate
by
my
show
of
concern
about
this
issue
because
though,
i
am
not
experienced
in
the
criminal
law
by
any
means,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
this
goes
beyond
any
point
involving
the
carrier’s
liability
for
substantive
offenses
which
has
ever
been
brought
before
this
court.
mr.
randolph
w.
thrower
i
think
that
this
--
there
is
--
i
find
no
precedent
for
this
kind
of
an
indictment
coming
before
this
court.
i
find
little
precedent
and
little
treatment
of
the
issue
in
any
lower
court.
i
think
it
is
to
a
considerable
extent,
a
case
of
first
impression
certainly
before
this
court.
thank
you
your
honors.
