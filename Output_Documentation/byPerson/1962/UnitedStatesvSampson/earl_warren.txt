mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
willens,
was
that
--
were
those
checks
in
final
--
suppose
to
be
in
the
final
payment
of
everything
that
they
owed
to
these
people
or
was
there
--
was
there
more
to
come
when
the
transaction
was
completed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it’s
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
on
this
transaction
on
page
51,
then
did
the
victim
write
a
check
for
the
entire
$900
or
checks
aggregating
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
why
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
concede
then
that
they
expected
no
more
money
from
him
if
this
document
said
that
he
was
to
pay
$900
on
toll?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
defense
stipulate
that
they
--
there
was
no
intention
of
performing
any
service
or
completing
any
transaction,
was
that
the
basis
for
these
stipulation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
willens,
when
you
speak
of
it
--
to
carry
out
this
particular
scheme,
you
don’t
limit
that
to
each
individual
transactions.
do
you
mean
the
general
scheme
to
defraud
the
public
by
these
various
transactions,
is
that
what
you
mean
by
this
particular
scheme?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
not
limited
to
each
transaction
as
one
scheme,
are
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that?
it
is
in
the
record
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
why
--
why
isn’t
that
a
part
of
that
--
detriment
part
of
the
transaction,
if
they
agreed
beforehand,
if
they
agreed
beforehand
that
for
payment
of
so
much
money,
if
accepted
by
the
defendants
that
it
would
be
a
deal?
and
here,
they
write
a
letter
and
they
say,
“this
is
your
acceptance
and
it
is
a
deal.”
why
isn’t
that
as
much
of
a
part
of
the
transaction
as
sending
the
money
itself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
well
i
misunderstood
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
clark.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
thrower.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
thrower
or
thrawer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thrower?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
that
end
the
transaction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
--
i
notice
here
on
this
exhibit
that’s
on
page
51
of
the
transcript,
the
agreement
that
the
victim
--
so-called
victim
signed
and
which
the
defendant
promised
to
sign
if
it
was
agreeable
to
him
said
this.
“this
agreement
shall
become
effective
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
payment
of
the
moneys
when
accepted
by
any
regional
office
of
lender
service
corporation.

in
the
event
the

is
not
accepted
by
lsc,
the
entire
fee
would
be
returned.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
isn’t
that
a
--
isn’t
that
vital
part
of
the
transaction
and
isn’t
it
just
the
other
side
of
the
coin
so
far
as
these
parties
are
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
under
the
law
of
conspiracy
if
they
join
together
for
the
purposes
of
doing
that
isn’t
that
a
--
doesn’t
that
make
it
a
continuing
conspiracy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
[inaudible]
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
was
to
keep
the
scheme
alive
and
operative
in
the
community
as
against
all
of
these
people
that
they
named
that
says
that
it
been
--
beginning
prior
to
march
9th,
1956
and
continuing
until
june
1,
1959,
the
defendants,
a
corporation
devised
and
intended
to
devise
a
scheme
and
artifice
to
defraud
then
naming
about
40
people
and
numerous
and
diverse
other
persons
throughout
the
united
states
were
owners
of
businesses
and
so
forth.
well
now,
wouldn’t
any
if
they
were
doing
it
to
--
having
these
transactions
at
different
times
and
that
keeping
of
all
scheme
alive
by
sending
mails
--
mail
through
--
and
letters
through
the
mail
and
documents
through
the
mail
saying,
“we’re
servicing
your
loan
and
we’re
going
to
do
so
and
so
for
you,
and
this
is
our
acceptance,”
and
as
it
says
at
page
50
there,
we
agreed
to
do
certain
other
things,
isn’t
that
keeping
the
--
isn’t
that
keeping
the
thing
alive
and
isn’t
that
using
the
mails
to
do
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
aren’t
there
other
things
besides
concealment
involved
here
mr.
thrower?
assuming
that
a
general
conspiracy
to
do
with
these
men
alleged
to
have
done
does
lie
as
it
has
been
charged
in
this
first
count
of
the
indictment
and
that
over
a
period
of
three
years
from
march
9th,
1956
to
june
1,
1959,
these
defendants
were
in
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
all
of
these
40
people
or
40
or
so
people
and
divert
–
numerous
and
diverse
other
persons
and
they
made
those
40
transactions,
had
those
40
transactions
and
that
part
of
that
transaction
in
each
case
was
to
pay
over
the
money,
and
then
to
have
these
receipts
going
back
saying
we
have
accepted
it
and
so
forth,
in
each
case
that
that
happens
over
a
period
of
three
years.
do
you
tell
us
that
that
is
not
a
continuing
conspiracy
and
that
these
things
are
keeping
the
conspiracy
going
in
the
community
or
in
the
country
or
whatever
if
the
--
whatever
the
jurisdiction
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
scheme?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
he
hired
out
to
do
these
things
and
was
trained
to
do
them,
specifically
trained
in
the
school
to
perform
these
kind
of
acts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
--
that’s
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
here
as
i
understand
it,
he
did
play
a
part
because
he
had
--
it
was
the
salesman
who
went
to
the
--
to
chester
j.
french
in
this
case
and
told
him
what
the
transaction
was
to
be
and
gave
him
this
lender
service
corporation
contract
which
includes
the
statement,
this
agreement
shall
become
effective
when
accepted
at
any
regional
office
and
so
forth
that
notifications
shall
be
made,
he
got
the
man’s
signature
on
that
and
then
took
it
to
his
principles
with
the
understanding
by
all
parties
concerned,
the
salesman
included
that
that
was
to
be
returned
as
a
part
of
the
transaction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
all
didn’t
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
all
had
their
own
transactions.
that’s
true.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
mr.
thrower.
mr.
willens.
