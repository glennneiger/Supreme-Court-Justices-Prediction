you
say
this
was
a
single
fraudulent
scheme?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
wouldn’t
it
be
arguable
that
there
couldn’t
be
more
than
one
count
of
the
indictment?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
counts
were
there
in
the
original
indictment?
justice
potter
stewart
so
these
people
are
convicted
on
all
of
the
counts
if
these
counts
are
restored
could
conceivably
be
sentenced
to
what,
440
years
in
the
penitentiary?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
thinking
--
maybe
i
--
this
isn’t
part
of
this
case
is
it,
in
its
present
posture
here,
but
don’t
you
think
there
might
arise
questions
in
this
case,
under
cases
like
[inaudible]
--
justice
potter
stewart
even
when
there
is
admittedly
about
a
single
scheme
to
defraud?
justice
potter
stewart
each
mailing
is
a
separate
offense.
you
say
that
settled?
justice
potter
stewart
what
the
district
court
says
about
its
dismissal?
justice
potter
stewart
didn’t
say
anything
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
looking
but
i
couldn’t
--
justice
potter
stewart
didn’t
say
a
word
about
--
about
its
reason?
justice
potter
stewart
because
he
didn’t
throw
all
the
counts
out.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
wouldn’t
that
be
a
matter
of
proof
at
the
trial?
