justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rolph,
don't
you
depend
on
--
that
what
you
can't
claim
on
the
contract
that
you
are
claiming
the
basis
of
a
completely
separate
port
between
these
two
vessels
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
the
right
of
contribution
as
a
--
in
the
admiralties
of
--
absolutely
separate
and
independent
towards
the
--
and
it
doesn't
arise
solely
because
an
employee
was
injured.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
if
you
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
like
the
--
like
the
shipowner
to
recover
from
--
on
the
longshoreman
because
he's
got
an
independent
right
of
action
against
him
under
contract
and
you're
saying
that
this
shipowner
got
an
independent
right
of
action
against
the
other
shipowner
because
of
the
historic
maritime
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
always
equal
--
equal
sharing
in
the
damages
in
collision
cases,
where
both
are
at
fault?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
american
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
english
admiralty
law,
one
vessel
could
sue
the
other
in
a
--
even
though
both
were
at
fault.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you
can
--
if
somebody
can
prove
that
one
is
more
than
--
more
at
fault
than
the
other,
there
should
be
unequal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
a
big
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
one
can't
recover
from
the
other
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
see.
because
one
is
damaged
--
if
one
is
damaged
$10,
another
damaged,
$100,
they
split
the
damage.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
that
one
doesn't
recover
from
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
if
one
is
damaged
$50
and
one
is
damaged
at
$50,
total
of
$100,
you
can't
recover
from
the
other
vessel?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
likewise
--
likewise,
ryan
is
very
a
persuasive
theory
because
it's
--
because
ryan
made
specific
--
say
at
this
specific
case
here
and
said
that
halcyon
is
what
the
joint
tortfeasors
contribution
case,
and
so
they
didn't
even
have
to
consider
this
problem
with
anything
else,
and
they
specifically,
left
this
case,
put
this
case
aside.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
ryan
really
isn't
persuasive
either,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
they
have
also
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
the
united
states
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
recovers.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they'll
consider
no
(inaudible)
in
the
case,
in
this
particular
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
can
make
just
as
good
an
argument
for
the
purpose
of
the
provision
was
to
start
united
states
off
a
plea
that
the
consequences,
the
factions
that
the
act
made
for
the
united
states,
namely
the
waiver
of
the
institutions,
things
like
that
--
they're
getting
back
to
this
and
say,
“you
cannot
be
liable
to
the
employee
in
this
situation
if
we
didn't
see
what
their
part
is.
so
we'll
just
start
you
off
as
though
there
hadn't
been
any
--
and
there
was
an
absolute
prohibition
against
liability
to
an
employee.”
so
you
can't
be
hurt
--
hurt
or
harmed
by
the
provisions
of
the
compensation
act,
it
wouldn't
leave
you
there.
and
then
if
you
have
to
be
liable,
the
third
party,
for
--
on
the
basis
of
some
other
law
or
some
other
doctrine,
why
does
it
worry
you
about
(inaudible)
following
the
liability
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rolph,
what
was
the
argument
in
the
--
in
the
--
the
accruing
of
the
damages
in
the
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
the
--
when
did
we
--
when
did
this
court
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
doctrine
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
it
that
the
--
that
the
english
rule
was
rejected?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
it
--
did
employees'
injuries
were
included
in
the
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
they
were
just
damaged
because
--
