in

may
i
ask
you
--
justice
hugo

black
--
what's
the
similarity
between
your
case
and
the
stevedoring?
is
it
here,
in
the
longshoremen
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
isn't
it
what
the
government
make
in
the
ryan
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
similar
to
their
position
in
ryan?

why
is

justice

may
i
ask
you
just
a
moment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wonder
what
do
you
think
(inaudible)
seemed
to
mean,
the
insurance
company
had
sold
their
policies
and
the
business
have
been
established
from
the
basis
that
the
case
--
that
the
only
payment
had
to
be
made
falls
under
the
act.
is
there
anything
here
that
could
show
us
how
the
--
i
am
sure
that
insurance
companies
are
involved,
i'm
not
asking
about
that
because
most
of
the
business
is
handled
that
way
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
take
judicial
notice
of
that.
is
there
any
showing
here
as
to
what
is
the
standard
practice
or
belief
of
the
insurance
company
when
fixing
their
rates
in
connection
with
this
or
is
this
a
true
minor
or
nature
to
justify
any
such
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
statement
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
while
your
client
is
--
i'm
sure
it
bought
insurance,
presumptively,
maybe
the
government
doesn't
buy
insurance,
that's
in
the
judgment,
i
guess
it
has
its
own
insurance.
but
is
this
of
--
frequent
enough
occurrence
and
so
forth
so
that
the
rate
for
the
insurance
company
would
be
altered,
conceivably
altered
by
way
--
whichever
way
we
decide
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
so,
what
has
been
the
accepted
practice
heretofore?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
has
been
in
vogue
for
how
long
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
not
as
fixed
as
anything
in
the
admiralty
law,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
about
as
fixed
in
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
contract
becomes
more
and
more
evanescent
since
then
in
the
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
really,
what's
left
under
that
tort
committee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
sounds
strikingly
familiar
to
me
here,
as
though
i
have
written
it
in
a
dissent
in
ryan.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
--
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you.
i
am
--
i'm
wondering
if
your
number
one
argument
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
precisely
the
number
one
argument
that
was
made
in
ryan?
your
number
one
argument,
that
you
could
not
increase
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
liability
because
the
statute
had
said
that
was
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
true
in
the
harbor
workers'
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
shipowner
stipulated
in
the
ryan
case,
that
he
was
not
depending
on
the
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
may
i
ask
you
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
question
about
--
for
the
long
time
since
i've
studied
torts,
but
i
--
i
have
a
big
recollection
about
the
mystery
i
had
about
the
difference
between
a
tort
that
was
based
on
the
obligation
arising
out
of
what
they
called
ex
contractu
and
one
that
was
based
on
simply
on
injury
that
was
wrong.
now,
suppose
this
man
had
sued
in
ryan
and
plainly
said,
as
i
thought
he
did
say,
“we're
not
suing
on
contract.
we
are
suing
on
the
court
inflicted
on
us
because
there
was
obligation
by
a
contractor
not
to
--
to
view
this
right
and
yet
we
are
suing
on
the
court,
common
law
tort,”
wouldn't
he
have
a
right
to
do
that?
can't
you
sue
on
either
way?
can't
you
label
it
tort,
a
contract
either
one
you
choose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
suing
for
tort.
that
if
--
when
does
a
contract
--
can't
you
sue
and
base
your
action
and
say
i'm
suing
on
a
tort
because
i'm
suing
the
violation
of
the
obligation
to
do
this
for
--
in
a
certain
way.
and
that
would
be
an
action
ex
delicto
as
i
recall
the
name
of
it.
but
if
you
say,
i'm
suing
here,
you
promise
to
this
by
contract.
i'm
suing
you
for
breach
of
contract,
you'd
reach
the
same
result
either
way,
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
what
you
are
saying
is
that
where
the
--
parties
can
choose,
either
to
call
it
ex
delicto
or
ex
contractu
on
the
same
circumstances
that
we
should
draw
a
distinction
and
disregard
what
was
held
in
ryan
on
that
thin
basis,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
could've
sued
either,
ex
delicto
or
ex
contractu
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
if
a
contract
has
anything
to
do
with
it
directly
or
indirectly
that
that
simply
changes
it,
doesn't
have
to
be
a
suit
on
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
look
at
the
facts.
when
you
look
at
facts
what
happens?
in
each
instance
you
have
a
case
where
a
shipowner
contributes
to
an
injury
--
contributes
to
an
injury.
here,
in
that
case,
the
court
was
--what
i
thought
created
enough
to
decide
for
purposes
of
its
own
that
there
they
would
disregard
the
exclusivity
part
of
it,
and
placed
the
liability
on
the
shipowner.
on
the
basis
of
an
ex
--
of
contract,
implied
contract,
here,
there
is
a
basis
of
a
license,
claim
in
the
collision
which
is
more
than
a
century
old
i
suppose,
maybe
several
centuries,
it's
a
long
established
claim
and
you
are
saying
that
that
should
not
be
treated
with
as
much
dignity
and
given
as
much
weight
in
determining
whether
the
actual
law
of
this
case
as
it
would
be
if
they
had
certain
claims
on
its
contract.
why
isn't
that
suit
--
whatever
you
call
it,
just
as
well
established
and
why
shouldn't
it
be
recognized
just
the
same
as
one
that
you
called
ex
contractu?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
argument
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
a
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
they
argued
in
ryan
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
question
about
the
government
consenting
to
be
sued
in
this
way,
is
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
mondello,
i
want
to
add
or
know
what
i
have
asked
you
about
the
statute.
i
know
that
that
i
think
you've
made
a
good
argument
although
i
am
trying
to
think
that
you
have
a
number
of
difficulties
in
your
way.
