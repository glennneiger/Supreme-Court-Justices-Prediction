mr.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
rolph,
i
know
you've
said
that
--
and
it
isn't
before
us,
no
question
here,
the
situation
of
apportioned
damages,
but
on
--
if
the
lower
court
was
right,
will
it
be
different
--
would
it
be
a
different
problem
if
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
apportionment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
my
question
though
is,
would
--
there
was
--
wouldn't
it
probably
any
difference
that
it
were
not
the
case
of
mutual
fault
or
where
there
have
been
a
propionate
allocation
of
fault
greater
to
one
than
to
the
other?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
--
i
know
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i'm
trying
--
i'm
not
making
myself
clear,
and
i
shouldn't
be
wasting
your
time
that
the
issue
wasn't
here.
as
i
understand
it,
what's
involved
here
is
whether
by
reason
of
the
exclusivity
provision
of
the
federal
statute,
the
ordinary
admiralty
rule
can
be
here
applied.
now,
if
we
actually
had
a
case
of
proportioned
responsibility
for
the
division
of
the
same
$16,000,
12
and
4,
let's
say,
wouldn't
we
still
have
a
question
whether
in
place
of
the
exclusivity
provision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
it
assigned
to
the
federal
government,
couldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
okay.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rolph,
before
you
get
to
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
do
you
suggest
who
would
be
included
within
that
language,
anyone
otherwise
entitled
to
recover
damages?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
was
a
father
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
didn't
come
within
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
language
“next
to
kin”?
he
was
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
you
add
them
together
and
divide
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
an
understatement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rolph.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
point
of
view.
certainly,
the
long
--
the
exclusivity
provision
of
the
longshoremen's
act
and
what
we're
dealing
with
here
on
the
employees'
compensation
act,
they're
identically
phrased,
aren't
they?
one
must
be
the
pattern
for
the
other.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
is
first?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
it
doesn't
matter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
being
so,
that
precedes
the
longshoremen's
act,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
the
language
of
both
is
identical
as
i
read
them
that
the
liability
in
there
as
to
the
employer,
here
as
to
the
united
states
shall
be
exclusive
in
place
of
all
other
liability.
here,
the
united
states,
there,
the
employee
and
that
statute
also
has
the
language
and
anyone
otherwise
entitled
to
recover
damages,
the
longshoremen's
act
has
as
this
one
does.
now,
in
ryan,
we
said
that
nevertheless
under
the
circumstances
of
that
case,
that
was
not
exclusive
and
the
literal
reading
--
language
of
exclusivity
was
not
to
be
given
effect.
well,
now
your
argument
here
i
should
think
can
be
as
narrow
as
similarly
for
the
reason
you've
stated,
namely
the
historic
admiralty
rule
and
applicable
in
situations
of
this
kind
ought
to
be
a
good
reason
for
not
giving
exclusivity
to
the
identical
language
of
this
provision,
shouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
do
you
have
to
go
beyond
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
i
agree
but
i've
--
what
i'm
wondering,
why
isn't
that
an
argument
against
giving
exclusivity
to
this
provision
just
as
we
refuse
to
give
exclusivity
to
the
identical
language
for
a
different
reason
in
ryan?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
longshoremen's
act
have
a
similar
provision
for
a
credit
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
year
was
the
chattahoochee?
well,
don't
bother,
don't
bother,
don't
waste
your
time.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
bother.
don't
waste
your
time.
