mr.
henry
r.
rolph
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
my
name
is
henry
rolph.
i'm
here
representing
the
petitioner,
weyerhaeuser
steamship
company.
this
case
is
a
proceeding
in
admiralty
and
as
an
outgrowth
of
an
action
which
was
commenced
in
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
northern
district
of
california.
it
developed
from
a
mutual
fault
collision
between
two
vessels.
one
vessel,
the
f.e.
weyerhaeuser
owned
by
weyerhaeuser
steamship
company
and
the
other
vessel,
united
states
army
dredge
pacific
operated
by
the
corps
of
engineers
of
the
united
states
army.
the
collision
occurred
on
september
8,
1955
in
the
area
near
coos
bay,
oregon.
the
weyerhaeuser
was
proceeding
outbound
from
coos
bay
and
the
dredge
pacific
was
on
a
opposing
course
and
they
both
--
collision
--
vessels
came
into
collision.
negotiations
were
conducted
to
attempt
to
explore
the
possibility
of
a
settlement.
a
settlement
was
impossible
and
the
case
was
tried
before
honorable
michael
j.
roach
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
the
court
held
that
both
vessels
were
at
fault
and
entered
a
decree
dividing
the
damages
pursuant
to
the
historic
admiralty
rule.
however,
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
action
on
the
principal
collision
litigation,
a
suit
had
been
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
washington
by
one
reynold
e.
ostrom
who
was
a
seaman
employee
of
the
united
states
employed
on
the
u.s.
army
dredge
pacific.
he
had
received
compensation
from
the
government
in
a
minor
amount,
to
be
exact
of
$329.01.
he
was
precluded
under
the
terms
of
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act
from
proceeding
directly
against
the
government.
he
commenced
his
action
against
weyerhaeuser
steamship
company
in
the
state
of
washington
and
that
action
was
held
up
pending
the
decision
on
the
principal
collision
action.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
collision
action,
a
special
hearing
was
held
before
the
u.s.
district
judge,
judge
roach
on
whether
or
not
damages
paid
to
mr.
ostrom
by
weyerhaeuser
were
includable
in
the
overall
damages
resulting
from
the
collision.
now,
in
this
connection,
the
suit
filed
by
ostrom,
the
government
employee
against
weyerhaeuser
had
been
compromised
for
an
agreed
payment
of
$16,000.
the
government
agreed
that
the
amount
of
the
settlement
was
reasonable
but
did
not
stipulate
or
agreed
to
the
fact
that
it
should
be
included
in
the
overall
damages
resulting
from
the
collision.
so
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
district
court
case,
the
case
was
concluded
for
all
practical
purposes
with
the
exception
of
this
one
item
of
damages.
now,
this
is
an
extremely
important
point
because
--
as
it
--
it
comes
up
in
a
case
where
the
figures
are
relatively
small
but
i
think
that
it's
incumbent
upon
me
to
present
to
the
court
the
overall
importance
of
what
is
involved
here
because
if
this
doctrine
which
was
ultimately
determined
to
be
the
doctrine
of
the
united
states
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
should
be
permitted
to
be
the
law
of
the
country,
then
and
in
that
event,
you'll
have
a
situation
where
a
private
vessel
comes
into
collision
with
a
government
vessel
and
should
--
if
there
is
a
substantial
loss
of
life
or
great
personal
injury
as
there
was
in
the
collision
between
the
united
states
navy
hospital
ship,
benevolence
and
the
private
vessel,
mary
luckenbach
where
15
government
employees
were
killed
and
85
were
seriously
injured,
you
have
a
tremendous
potential
liability
against
the
private
vessel
under
the
doctrine
as
concluded
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
now,
to
back
up
a
minute
on
the
history
of
the
case,
judge
roach
held
that
the
$16,000
item
of
damages
was
merely
another
item
of
damages
and
was
to
be
included
in
the
overall
damages
resulting
from
the
collision
and
applying
the
admiralty
rule,
it
would
be
divided
by
two.
now,
the
government
protested
that.
they
requested
a
rehearing
on
the
subject
before
judge
roach.
the
rehearing
in
the
district
court
was
denied.
the
matter
was
then
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
by
the
government
and
the
case
was
heard
before
the
ninth
circuit
and
an
order
was
entered
ruling
that
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act
was
paramount
and
that
the
payments
which
the
government
made
pursuant
to
the
compensation
act
were
exclu
--
the
exclusive
limit
of
their
liability.
so
that
we
have
here
before
us
now
for
the
first
time
a
case
where
there's
an
attempt
to
make
an
exception
to
the
divided
damages
rule
which
has
existed
since
the
beginning
of
time
on
these
admiralty
maritime
collision
cases.
now,
it's
our
argument
of
course
that
the
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
yes.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
no.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
thank
you
for
raising
that
point,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
let's
assume
on
the
basis
of
the
entry
of
the
decree
which
was
made
by
judge
roach
at
the
district
court
level
that
both
vessels
were
held
mutually
at
fault
and
the
divided
damages
rule
apply.
the
government
has
made
no
contention
that
there
should
be
an
apportionment
of
damages
and
that
point
isn't
in
the
case.
now,
so
much
for
the
factual
background
of
the
case,
now,
it's
interesting
the
way
the
question
is
presented
to
the
court
and
in
comparing
the
statement
of
the
question,
there
are
some
substantial
differences
between
the
way
we
state
it,
between
the
way
the
government
state
it
in
its
brief
in
opposition
to
our
petition
for
certiorari,
and
the
way
the
government
now
states
it.
now,
we
state
that
what
is
involved
in
the
case
is
--
is
the
historic
and
established
rule
of
divided
damages
in
mutual
fault
collisions
to
be
altered
for
the
first
time
by
a
federal
compensation
statute.
the
question
as
presented
in
the
government's
briefs
in
opposition
to
our
petitioner
for
certiorari
states
it
whether
the
exclusivity
provision
of
the
federal
employee's
compensation
act
precludes
the
petitioner,
weyerhaeuser
from
covering
--
from
recovering
from
the
united
states
when
half
of
its
tort
liability
to
a
government
employee
in
the
mutual
fault
collision
between
petitioner's
vessel
and
the
government
vessel.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
now
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
yes.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
well,
the
--
it's
accepted
mr.
justice
brennan
that
issue
was
determined
in
the
lower
court
that
both
vessels
were
equally
at
fault,
so
then
the
mutual
fault
damage
rule
comes
into
play.
and
the
damages
of
both
vessels
are
added
together
and
then
under
the
prehistoric
moiety
rule,
they're
divided
two.
now,
there's
no
question
on
that
basic
procedure
involved
here.
the
only
question
that
is
now
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
government
must
participate
in
the
damages
which
weyerhaeuser
incur
in
affecting
the
settlement
with
ostrom,
the
government
employee,
to
whom
the
government
had
previously
made
compensation
payments.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
well,
of
course,
under
the
mutual
fault
collisions
historically
in
this
country,
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
contrasted
with
the
law
of
england,
if
both
vessels
are
found
to
be
at
fault,
there's
only
one
rule
that
can
be
applied
under
the
historic
decisions
of
this
court
including
the
chattahoochee
and
the
atlas,
and
the
juanita,
and
these
many
other
decisions
at
--
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
yes.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
the
(inaudible)
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
yes.
that
was
a
--
excuse
me,
i
misunderstood
the
question
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
--
mr.
justice
brennan.
yes.
to
--
under
that
situation,
the
question
would
be
identical.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
now,
significantly
the
government
in
its
brief
before
this
court
in
stating
the
question
prefers
to
ignore
now
the
mutual
fault
collision
divided
damage
rule
and
states
the
question
this
way,
whether
section
7
(b)
of
the
federal
employer's
compensation
act
which
states
the
liability
of
the
united
states
under
the
act
for
injuries
to
its
employees
shall
be
exclusive.
and
in
place
of
all
other
liability
of
the
united
states
for
the
employee
and
on
the
--
one
otherwise
entitled
to
recover
it
from
the
united
states
on
account
of
such
injury
precludes
a
suit
by
a
third
party
to
obtain
contribution
the
payment
of
damages
on
account
of
an
injury
to
a
federal
employee
covered
by
the
act.
without
belaboring
the
point,
it's
quite
obvious
that
the
way
the
question
is
presented
where
the
government
in
its
brief
here
had
completely
ignores
the
mutual
fault
divided
damages,
admiralty
doctrine
arising
where
you
have
a
maritime
collision
and
both
vessels
have
been
found
to
be
equally
at
fault.
now
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
well,
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
well,
basically
that's
the
argument
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
--
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that's
right,
i
think
it's
just
the
question
of
emphasis
but
i
do
think
that
it's
extremely
important
in
approaching
the
question
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
--
under
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
language
particularly
in
the
halcyon
case
that
if
we
recognize
that
what
we
have
here
before
us
is
a
mutual
fault
divided
damages
collision.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that
would
be
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that's
correct.
that's
exactly
correct.
that's
the
point.
now,
this
is
basically
a
question
of
statutory
construction
according
to
the
government's
interpretation
of
the
matter
and
the
applicable
statute
of
course
is
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act
which
provides
that
the
united
states
shall
pay
compensation
as
herein
specified
for
the
disability
or
death
of
an
employee
resulting
to
personal
injury
sustained
while
in
the
performance
of
his
duty.
but
no
compensation
shall
be
paid
if
the
injury
or
death
is
caused
by
willful
misconduct
of
the
employee.
now,
the
important
part
of
this,
we
--
as
we
consider
it
is
in
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
that
the
statute
itself
restricts
the
liability
here
to
an
employ
--
to
the
liability
arising
to
the
employee,
his
legal
representative,
spouse,
dependent,
next
to
kin
and
anyone
otherwise
entitled
to
recover
damages
from
the
united
states.
now,
that
language
is
limiting
language.
now,
we
think
that
the
wording
of
the
statute
is
most
important
and
we
consider
that
the
wording
of
the
statute
shows
a
clear
legislative
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
restrict
the
liability
as
between
the
employer
and
his
employee.
and
section
757
(b)
of
the
act
specifically
provides
that
the
liability
shall
be
one
to
the
employee
or
someone
in
a
relationship
to
him.
now,
the
government
on
the
other
hand
is
taking
that
language
and
in
doing
so,
we
think
is
violating
the
rules
of
construction
which
have
been
established
by
this
court
in
cases
which
we've
--
and
cited
in
our
brief
and
takes
the
language
that
anyone
otherwise
entitled
to
recover
damages
from
the
united
states
would
include
some
third
person
unrelated
to
the
employee-employer
relationship.
now,
the
specific
categories
in
the
statute
are
the
employee,
his
relatives
and
his
dependents.
and
the
government
is
attempting
here
to
apply
the
general
words,
anyone
otherwise
entitled
to
recover
damages
to
a
person
seeking
to
recover
after
mutual
fault
collision
which
is
obviously
a
matter
unconnected
with
the
employer's
relationship
with
his
workers
and
their
families.
now,
when
we
stop
and
think
of
the
purpose
of
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act,
we
can
see
that
there
was
obviously
no
intention
by
congress
that
this
should
apply
to
a
third
person
because
the
purpose
of
the
employees'
compensation
act
as
set
forth
in
the
legislative
discussion
in
our
brief
and
in
appendix
to
it
was
to
give
to
the
employee
an
assured
recovery
and
in
return
as
part
of
the
quid
pro
quo,
the
government
was
to
have
a
limitation
of
liability
and
it
was
--
and
the
scheme
was
of
--
the
compensation
act
were
adopted
for
this
very
purpose.
and
it
would
be
quite
inappropriate
to
hold
that
a
third
party
vessel
owner
which
had
no
relationship
to
the
employee-employer
relationship
and
was
not
involved
in
the
quid
pro
quo
exchange
should
be
called
upon
to
bear
the
entire
front
of
the
damages
resulting
from
the
collision
to
which
the
government
vessel
had
been
equally
responsible
through
its
negligence.
now,
further
we
wished
to
point
out
that
in
the
act,
the
word
a
direct
is
used.
direct
modifying
judicial
proceedings
in
section
757
(b)
of
the
act
and
this
obviously
is
not
a
direct
legal
proceeding.
what
we
have
here
is
an
action
which
arose
out
of
the
collision.
the
collision
was
--
action
was
commenced
between
the
employee
and
weyerhaeuser
steamship
company
and
totally
unrelated
to
him
in
the
state
of
washington
and
the
principal
action
was
an
action
for
collision
damages
between
the
weyerhaeuser
steamship
company
and
the
united
states
government.
so,
obviously
what
we
have
before
us
on
a
basis
of
the
construction
of
the
statute
is
not
a
direct
proceeding
as
the
term
that's
meant
in
the
act.
now,
furthermore
we
think
from
a
standpoint
of
determining
the
intention
of
congress
in
this
statute,
the
proceedings
with
reference
to
the
1949
amendments
to
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act
are
quite
enlightening
and
we
think
indicative
of
the
fact
that
congress
intend
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
yes.
mr.
henry
r.

yes.
that
point

no,
the

is
that

brought
an

mr.

the

from

and
therefore
the
only
right
of
recovery
was
under
the
federal

act.
now,
coming
up
to
the
point
of
the
1949
amendments
to
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act,
we
wish
to
point
out
that
there
was
--
that
the
court
has
previously
reviewed
these
amendments
in
the
case
of
johansson
versus
the
united
states
and
the
legislative
history
is
quite
well-defined
there
but
we
do
wish
to
make
this
comment
that
there
was
--
in
the
original
draft,
when
the
bill
was
before
the
house,
there
was
very
general
language
that
the
remedy
would
be
afforded
to
any
person
under
the
act
with
respect
to
his
own
injury
or
the
death
of
another
individual
unless
otherwise
specifically
provided
by
law.
now,
the
situation
was
that
it
went
over
to
the
senate
that
in
this
very
general
language
was
revised
and
then
it
went
a
joint
conference
and
the
present
language
which
is
much
more
specific
was
adopted
which
restricts
it
to
the
liability
to
the
united
states
or
its
instrumentalities
under
this
act,
thereof
with
respect
to
the
injury
or
death
of
an
employee
shall
be
exclusive.
so
that
they've
gone
from
the
general
to
the
specific
and
therefore
we
think
that
the
only
proper
construction
of
that
change
is
that
congress
con
--
intended
that
it
was
to
be
an
act
which
applied
exclusively
between
the
employee
and
the
employer
and
had
no
bearing
on
outside
third
persons,
in
this
case
an
independent
shipowner.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that's
quite
right
your
honor
and
we've
tried
to
define
what
information
we
could.
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
there's
a
language
in
the
court
between
senator
morris
and
senator
lucas.
senator
lucas
was
evidently
the
manager
of
the
bill
in
the
senate.
and
senator
morris
requested
that
the
bill
be
amended
to
provide
that
it
should
not
apply
to
the
master
or
seaman
of
any
vessel.
and
thereafter,
that
amendment
was
added
in
but
in
the
case
of
johansson
versus
the
united
states,
it
was
held
that
the
acts
of
the
master
and
the
seaman
where
the
rights
were
the
same
after
the
legislation
as
they
had
been
before.
so
therefore
they
were
both
precluded,
both
the
master
and
the
seaman
from
maintaining
an
independent
action.
and
that's
in
the
case
of
johansson
versus
united
states
where
this
court
has
previously
gone
into
the
legislative
history
of
this
act.
now,
we
think
further
that
to
permit
the
government
to
be
immune
from
participating
in
the
divided
damages
resulting
from
mutual
fault
collision
is
in
clear
violation
of
the
spirit
intent
of
the
public
vessels
act
of
the
united
states.
now,
this
court
in
the
case
of
the
canadian
aviator
in
1945
and
united
states
versus
shaw
in
1940
have
reviewed
the
provisions
of
the
public
vessels
act
and
held
that
they
are
fully
applicable
to
the
united
states
and
the
history
of
course
of
the
public
vessels
act
is
that
--
in
1924,
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
shaw,
and
the
case
of
the
western
maid,
justice
holmes
held
that
unless
there
was
affirmative
action
by
the
united
states
to
participate
in
the
litigation,
it
was
immune
under
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity.
thereafter,
quite
interestingly
and
this
is
most
important,
judge
holmes
in
the
case
of
thekla
decided
in
1924
also
that
the
--
if
the
united
states
joins
in
litigation
under
the
--
regardless
of
whether
there's
a
statute
of
sovereign
immunity
or
not
and
this
decision
of
this
court
preceded
the
public
vessels
act,
joins
in
the
litigation
arising
from
a
maritime
collision
as
it
had
in
that
case
by
filing
either
a
libel
or
a
cross
libel.
and
the
significant
point
is
that
here
although
we
file
the
libel,
the
united
states
filed
a
cross
libel
seeking
affirmative
damages.
so
that
even
in
the
absence
of
the
public
vessels
act,
the
--
there
was
a
right
of
the
courts
to
grant
a
recovery
against
the
united
states
where
united
states
had
joined
in
the
proceeding.
therefore,
basically
even
before
the
passage
of
the
public
vessels
act
where
the
government
did
as
it
did
here
filed
a
cross
libel
and
affirmatively
joined
in
the
litigation,
then
it
waived
it
sovereign
immunity.
now,
we
make
an
--
we
emphasize
this
because
we
think
that
quite
inappropriately
in
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
opinions
--
appeal
written
by
just
--
judge
barnes,
he
brings
in
the
question
of
sovereign
immunity
which
we
feel
has
no
place
in
the
case.
but
--
and
indicates
that
by
the
passage
of
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act,
there
was
a
withdrawal
of
the
sovereign
--
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
originally
granted
in
the
public
vessels
act,
and
therefore
we
mention
this
because
we
think
that
to
grant
any
sort
of
an
end
road
through
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act
in
an
indirect
way
in
favor
of
the
government
would
in
affect
--
in
effect
be
reducing
the
effect
of
the
public
vessels
act
and
the
effect
granted
by
this
court
that
where
the
united
states
joins
in
litigation
that
that
is
a
complete
waiver
in
--
of
its
sovereign
immunity.
and
the
court
hearing
the
case
can
proceed
to
judge
all
damages
arising
in
the
case
and
in
this
case,
injuries
to
those
on
either
vessel,
parties
on
either
vessel.
now,
we
think
that
it's
also
significant
in
the
consideration
of
this
court
that
the
court
consider
its
decisions
starting
with
the
halcyon
case
and
the
ryan
case
and
the
nacirema-weyerhaeuser
case,
crumady
versus
fisser
and
the
waterman
versus
dugan
&
mcnamara
cases.
now,
those
cases
starting
with
the
ryan
stevedoring
case
versus
pan-atlantic
have
recognized
that
even
though
and
in
that
--
those
cases
decided
under
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act,
that
even
though
there's
an
--
there
is
an
attempt
under
the
compensation
acts
to
give
an
exclusive
liability
to
the
employee
as
against
this
employer
that
the
third
party
can
recover.
now,
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
yes.
yes,
justice
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
they
are
substantially
the
same.
the
exclusivity
provisions
mr.
justice
black
in
that
one
is
a
federal
employees'
compensation
act
which
is
the
act
that
we
have
here.
we
also
have
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
which
was
before
this
court
in
the
ryan
case
and
the
other
cases
that
have
been
decided
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
the
ryan
took
--
in
the
ryan
case,
it's
quite
an
interesting
point,
your
honor,
they
were
not
a
party
to
the
case,
but
they
filed
an
amicus
curiae
brief
and
their
position
in
the
ryan
case
was
an
they
had
actually
adjoined
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
that
the
compensa
--
that
the
federal
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
was
exclusive
only
as
between
the
employee
and
the
employer.
and
if
the
employee
filed
an
independent
action
in
this
case
against
the
shipowner,
in
the
ryan
case,
then
and
in
that
event,
there
would
be
a
right
of
a
full
recovery
in
the
event
that
there
was
found
to
be
a
breach
of
the
so-called
warranty
of
indemnity
to
perform
the
stevedoring
contract
in
a
workmanlike
manner.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
and
their
position
here,
we
consider
to
be
entirely
inconsistent
in
--
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor
we
quote
from
their
brief,
in
the
ryan
case
and
i
think
that
it's
particularly
significant
that
mr.
justice
black
has
raised
this
question
because
we
think
that
the
briefs
in
the
ryan
case
and
the
other
amicus
curiae
briefs
which
have
been
written
by
the
government
of
which
i
believe
there
are
others
in
the
waterman
case
and
in
the
crumady
versus
the
henry
fisser
case,
take
the
diametrically
opposed
position
to
what
they
are
taking
here.
but
my
counsel
of
--
on
my
right
--
well,
as
they
have
indicated
in
their
brief
will
attempt
to
reconcile
this
apparent
inconsistent
position
of
the
government
on
the
ground
that
the
ryan
case
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
breach
of
warranty
of
the
contract
to
perform
on
a
workmanlike
manner.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
well,
in
that
case
your
honor,
the
case
went
off
on
the
ground
of
contract
and
it's
quite
obvious
on
the
cases
that
have
come
up
since.
there
was
a
crumady
versus
hendrik
fisser
where
there
was
no
relationship
at
all
between
the
shipowner
and
the
employee.
and
then
in
fact
the
case
there
was
--
the
suit
was
brought
against
it
or
the
charterer
of
the
vessel
had
in
fact
employed
the
stevedoring
company.
the
shipowner
had
had
no
direct
relationship
with
them.
and
then
in
the
later
case
of
the
waterman
versus
dugan
&
mcnamara
company
which
incidentally
we've
neglected
to
cite
in
our
brief,
but
i'm
certain
that
the
court
is
well
familiar
with
it,
it
was
held
by
this
court
in
the
waterman
case
that
there
was
--
would
still
be
a
right
of
recovery
even
though
there
wasn't
an
expressed
contract
where
the
arrangements
for
the
unloading
of
the
vessel
between
the
stevedoring
contactor
and
the
employee
were
made
by
a
consignee
of
the
cargo.
and
so
that
the
point
is,
the
case
still
recognizes
that
there
was
a
contractual
relationship
and
based
on
this
violation
of
the
breach
of
warranty
to
perform
on
a
workmanlike
manner,
there
was
a
right
of
recovery
recognized
over
in
spite
of
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
act
by
the
shipowner
which
was
called
upon
to
pay
the
judgment
to
the
individuals
steved
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
well,
that's
the
effect
mr.
justice
black
of
the
ryan
case
and
the
cases
which
have
followed
it,
quite
obviously
that
the
federal
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
act
is
an
exclusive
liability
provision
exactly
as
this
is,
but
that's
between
the
stevedoring
contractor
who
was
the
employer
and
the
individual
longshoreman.
so
that
under
that
act,
there
is
no
direct
right
between
the
longshoreman
and
his
employer.
but
as
result
of
his
going
to
the
shipowner
and
filing
a
suit
against
the
shipowner
just
as
was
done
by
ostrom,
the
government
employee
here,
then
he
would
have
a
right
independent
of
the
statute
and
the
ryan
case
and
the
following
cases
of
this
court
under
the
ryan
doctrine
have
recognized
that
the
shipowner
would
then
have
a
full
right
of
recovery
over
for
whatever
damages
he
incurred
if
he
was
able
to
establish
that
there
has
been
a
breach
of
the
warranty
of
indemnity
to
perform
the
service
of
unloading
or
loading
the
vessel
in
the
workmanlike
manner.
so
that
there
is
a
striking
similarity
and
get
--
the
government's
position,
we
think,
is
utterly
inconsistent
in
the
ryan
case
and
the
following
cases
and
this
particular
case.
and
the
--
in
the
ryan
opinion,
the
government
made
--
pointed
this
out
to
the
court.
the
compensation
acts
in
concurring
immunity
on
the
employer
from
common
law
suits
by
the
employee
and
its
dependents
did
not
mean
to
free
the
employer
from
suits
by
outsiders.
now,
what
could
be
clearer
than
that?
that's
what
we
have
right
here
before
us
in
this
case.
this
is
the
government's
brief
in
the
ryan
case.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
well,
it
shows
that
the
purpose
of
the
compensation
acts
in
granting
an
immunity
on
the
employer
from
common
law
suits
did
not
mean
to
free
the
employer
from
suits
by
outsiders.
now,
in
this
case,
you've
got
the
government
to
reverse
position.
in
the
ryan
case,
the
government
was
interested
in
the
position
of
the
shipowner.
here
of
course,
the
government's
interest
is
not
in
the
shipowner
but
in
the
position
of
the
employer.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
it
stated
its
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
--
it
stated
its
position
in
the
briefs
quite
clearly
and
his
interest
in
the
case
was
that
of
a
shipowner
and
in
ship
operator,
and
of
course
that
came
from
the
cases
which
the
government
had
in
operating
and
owning
vessels
as
it
did
through
the
war
shipping
administration
during
the
war
and
the
year
shortly
following
the
war.
so
the
position
there
basically
is
that
the
--
they're
around
on
the
other
foot
trying
to
get
over
--
a
right
over
against
the
employer
so
that
they
won't
be
held
liable
for
all
the
damages.
so,
plainly
and
simply
your
honor,
i
think
when
the
cases
are
compared
to
this
case
it's
quite
evident
that
there's
an
obvious
inconsistency
in
the
government's
pos
--
only
can
try
to
explain
its
position
on
one
basis
which
mr.
mondello
will
attempt
to
do,
i'm
sure.
and
that
is
in
these
cases
involving
the
long
--
federal
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act,
there's
been
some
sort
of
a
contractual
relationship
and
based
on
this
contractual
breach
of
warranty
by
the
stevedore
to
perform
in
a
workmanlike
manner,
that
breach
of
the
warranty
of
indemnity
gives
the
right
over
by
the
shipowner
against
the
employer.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
well,
we
--
we're
not
in
the
position
to,
your
honor.
i
mean
--
well,
you
see,
we
were
talking
about
a
mutual
fault
collision.
we
have
two
vessels,
one,
a
government
vessel,
one,
a
private
vessel,
both
on
opposing
courses
in
a
fog,
no
negotiations.
one
vessel's
presence
is
unknown
to
the
other,
and
they
come
into
collision.
we
haven't
any
--
a
basis
for
pointing
out
that
there
was
any
prior
relationship
or
that
the
cargo
of
one
vessel
was
dependent
on
the
work
of
the
stevedoring
contractor
as
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
ryan
and
the
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
yes.
that's
right.
that's
--
on
this
particular
point,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that
is
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that's
exactly
correct
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
--
mr.
justice
white
and
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that's
--
that's
a
correct
statement
your
--
mr.
justice
white.
and
that's
the
next
point
that
i
was
going
to
make
in
my
argument
here,
and
that
is
that
we
consider
that
the
long
established
admiralty
rule
of
divided
damages
should
not
be
modified
or
changed
by
indirection
and
that
what
occurs
here
is
when
two
vessels
come
into
collision
and
under
the
historic
decisions
which
have
construed
the
mutual
fault
doctrine
and
applied
the
divided
damages
rule,
it's
been
recognized
that
the
cause
of
action
arises
not
on
a
derivative
basis
or
not
on
the
basis
of
any
contractual
relationship
but
directly
from
the
tort,
directly
from
the
act
of
the
two
vessels
coming
into
collision.
and
from
that
fact,
of
the
vessels
coming
in
to
collision,
all
of
the
damages
which
result
from
the
collision
must
be
totaled
and
divided
by
two.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
they're
--
under
the
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
there
is,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
well,
of
course,
both
can
sue
here
and
it's
just
a
question
of
determination.
in
this
case,
for
instance
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
no,
not
that.
no,
under
the
american
doctrines,
if
both
vessels
are
found
at
fault,
there
would
be
no
apportionment
of
damages.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that's
correct.
well,
no.
excuse
me.
that
would
be
rule
of
contributory
negligence
which
is
not
applicable
here
wherein
in
admiralty
under
the
divided
damages
rule.
so
each
vessel
is
at
fault.
it
becomes
a
question
of
damage
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that's
--
that's
exact
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
yes.
that's
right.
you
split
the
damages
and
divide
it
by
two
and
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
well,
yes.
you
add
the
damages
together
and
then
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that's
correct.
it's
an
adjustment
of
damages
and
there
are
many,
many
cases
that
have
recognized
this.
but
to
digress
for
a
minute,
the
canadian
law
permits
an
apportionment,
and
the
british
law
permits
an
apportionment
of
damages
based
on
relevant
degrees
of
fault.
if
however,
there
is
not
such
a
thing
under
our
doctrine
as
determining
the
relative
degrees
of
fault.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
well
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
the
difference
is
this,
mr.
justice
black
that
contribution
is
really
what
we
consider
not
to
be
an
appropriate
term
for
divided
damages
because
what
occurs
is
that
there's
an
impact
between
two
vessels
as
resulting
damage
to
each.
the
damages
are
added
up
and
there
then
divided
by
two.
now,
that
arises
properly
from
the
collision
itself.
it's
not
a
participation
as
between
two
people
to
the
damages
involved
to
a
third
person
which
was
a
situation
which
was
before
the
court
in
the
halcyon
case.
the
damages
here
arise
directly
from
the
maritime
collision
and
as
a
result
of
the
maritime
collision,
the
so-called
moiety
rule
applies
and
with
the
moiety
rule,
all
of
the
damages
resulting
from
the
collision
are
totaled
together.
if
both
vessels
are
found
to
be
at
fault,
as
they
were
in
this
case,
and
then
they're
equally
distributed
between
both
vessels.
so
under
strict
analysis,
that
is
not
contribution
as
we
analyze
it
as
the
term
has
been
used
in
other
tort
cases.
but
it's
a
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
no
--
that's
quite
correct
your
honor.
this
--
it
isn't
necessary
at
all
to
overrule
ryan
in
this
case
for
the
reason
that
you've
got
the
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
halcyon
--
no,
there's
a
--
of
course
in
the
halcyon
case,
there's
a
specific
provision
for
this
situation
directly
in
the
court's
opinion
which
is
as
follows,
halcyon
lines
versus
haenn
ship
ceiling,
where
two
vessels
collide
due
to
the
fault
of
both.
it
is
established
admiralty
doctrine
that
the
mutual
wrongdoers
shall
share
equally
the
damages
sustained
by
each
as
well
as
personal
injury
and
property
damage
inflicted
on
innocent
third
parties.
this
maritime
rule
is
of
ancient
origin
and
has
been
applied
in
many
cases.
but
this
court
has
never
expressly
applied
it
to
non-collision
cases.
so
that
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that's
correct,
your
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that's
the
very
point
in
issue,
yes,
your
honor.
and
as
far
as
the
halcyon
case
is
concerned,
it
made
specific
provision
for
this
very
case
so
that
there
would
be
no
conflict
whatsoever
with
halcyon
at
all.
now
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that's
correct.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
well,
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that's
the
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that's
quite
correct,
mr.
justice
black.
but
the
rationale
of
the
decision
is
that
that
was
reached.
the
exclusive
provisions
were
in
fact
overcome
by
the
finding
of
a
breach
of
a
warranty
of
a
contractual
relationship
but
the
contractual
relationship
with
each
succeeding
case
since
ryan
has
become
vaguer
and
more
difficult
to
proceed.
now,
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
yes.
now,
in
addition
before
closing,
i
wish
to
call
the
court's
attention
the
striking
similarity
between
--
what
the
situation
that
we
have
here
and
the
harter
act
decision
starting
with
the
case
of
the
chattahoochee
and
the
harter
act
was
a
case
or
the
harter
act
is
a
statute
which
grants
immunity
to
a
shipowner
for
suits
brought
by
his
own
cargo.
and
this
court
in
the
famous
case
of
the
chattahoochee
held
that
a
shipowner,
although
he
had
no
direct
right
for
damages
--
no
direct
liability
for
damages
to
his
own
cargo.
nevertheless,
he
would
be
called
upon
to
pay
if
in
a
suit
over
against
the
other
vessel,
his
cargo
was
called
upon
to
pay
into
the
overall
contribution
then,
he
would
have
to
share
a
part
of
those
damages
equally.
now,
the
court
went
--
recognized
that
the
harter
act
granted
immunity
between
a
shipowner
and
a
cargo
owner
so
that
the
cargo
owner
--
so
that
the
shipowner
could
not
be
liable
for
any
damages
resulting
to
the
cargo
on
his
own
ship.
but
if
the
cargo
on
his
own
ship
filed
a
cross
libel
against
the
other
vessel
as
it
did
in
the
chattahoochee
then
--
and
gained
a
recovery,
then
the
non-carrying
vessel
would
have
the
right
to
apportion
those
damages
to
the
cargo
on
the
carrying
vessel
to
the
damages
resulting
from
the
overall
collision.
so
that
you
have
a
strikingly
similar
situation
under
the
harter
act
and
to
what
you
have
here
under
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act
and
there
have
been
decisions
since
by
this
court
since
the
harter
act,
united
states
versus
atlantic
mutual
insurance
company
decided
in
1952.
and
before
closing
on
that,
i
would
just
like
to
call
to
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
oh.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
it
is
this
case
your
honor.
there's
no
question
about
it.
and
in
this
particular
case,
interestingly
enough
to
show
how
the
mechanics
of
it
work,
in
the
record
on
the
case,
there
is
a
breakdown
of
the
damages
which
appear
on
page
74
of
the
record
and
it
shows
in
this
very
case
that
our
vessel
was
called
upon
under
the
provisions
of
the
doctrine
of
the
chattahoochee
to
pay
half
the
damages
resulting
to
dam
--
to
the
cargo
on
its
own
vessel.
and
if
you
--
looking
on
the
record
at
page
74,
it
says,
$16,000
paid
to
ostrom
and
then
it
says
$20,490
paid
to
the
intervening
liableness,
the
intervening
liableness
in
this
case
were
the
cargo
representatives
on
the
f.e.
weyerhaeuser
who
have
filed
the
suit.
there
was
no
cargo
on
the
government
dredge
and
those
damages
were
brought
into
play
and
under
the
doctrine
of
the
chattahoochee,
our
client
f.e.
--
the
owner
of
the
f.e.
weyerhaeuser
was
called
upon
to
pay
half
of
the
damages
to
its
own
cargo
even
though
it
extensively
have
immunity
against
those
damages
under
the
provisions
of
the
harter
act.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that's
right.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
no.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
are
you
asking
me
now
mr.
justice
black
with
reference
to
the
situation
that
we
have
in
this
case?
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
yes.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that's
a
very
good
question,
your
honor,
and
the
answer
to
it
would
be
this
that
there
would
be
a
very
materially
great
rise,
i
would
think,
in
the
rates,
the
protection
and
indemnity
insurance
rates
on
private
vessels
if
in
the
future
under
this
doctrine,
if
it's
permitted
to
stand
up
in
this
case,
that
the
private
vessel
will
be
responsible
for
all
of
the
damages
resulting
on
the
publicly
owned
vessel.
now,
you
take
the
benevolence
collision
which
i
referred
to
with
the
hospital
ship,
benevolence
was
sunk
on
a
trial
trip
off
from
san
francisco
in
1950.
the
ship
was
lost.
there
were
85
serious
injuries.
there
were
15
deaths.
under
the
doc
--
and
incidentally,
it's
an
interesting
sidelight,
we
haven't
ever
been
able
to
obtain
the
damages
of
--
that
was
--
the
case
was
settled
and
evidently
the
--
as
part
of
the
settlement,
it
was
concluded
that
the
damage
figures
would
not
be
released.
so,
they've
not
been
available
to
us.
but
the
effect
would
be
in
a
situation
of
that
type
and
we
can
take
it
to
another
collision
that
occurred
just
a
few
weeks
ago
off
of
long
beach
between
the
peninsula
and
oriental
lines,
oriana
and
the
united
states
navy
carrier,
kearsarge.
now
fortunately,
the
damages
weren't
particularly
great
in
that,
but
if
both
of
those
vessels
had
been
damaged
and
if
there
have
been
a
great
loss
of
life
on
the
kearsarge
with
serious
personal
injury,
that
this
doctrine
would
be
permitted
to
hold
up,
then
the
limit
off
the
government's
liability
would
be
under
the
statutes
for
the
soldiers
and
sailors.
there
would
be
no
right
of
recovery
but
those
same
soldiers
and
sailors
could
sue
that
private
vessel,
namely
the
oriana
in
this
case,
for
an
unlimited
amount
and
there
would
be
no
apportionment
through
the
divided
damages
equal
fault
doctrine.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that's
been
in
vogue
since
the
beginning
of
time
and
it
was
first
defined
by
this
court
in
detail
in
the
case
of
the
catharine.
i
believe
the
date
is
1854,
it
was
gone
over
again
in
the
north
star,
it
was
reviewed
again
in
chattahoochee,
it
was
reviewed
recently
in
it
by
this
court
in
the
canadian
aviator,
and
the
united
states
versus
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
your
honor?
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
its
--
there's
just
absolutely
no
question
about
it
and
i
could
stand
here
and
go
on
with
no
end
of
authorities
on
the
subject.
it's
very
definitely
accepted,
had
been
fixed
from
the
beginning
in
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
yes
mr.
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
mr.
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
yes.
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
which
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
with
the
federal
employee
--
federal
employees'
compensation
act
was
originally
enacted
in
1916,
was
modified
in
1949.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
yes.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
yes.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
except
for
the
fact
that
we
have
here
a
special
situation
which
has
been
defined
by
this
court
in
the
halcyon
case,
you
have
an
admiralty
collision
case
with
its
special
rules
of
damages,
and
for
that
reason
we
have
a
separate
and
distinct
matter
before
the
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
well,
the
--
i
would
say
that
this
case
is
controlled
or
certainly
should
be
influenced
by
the
doctrine
of
this
court
in
ryan.
the
only
point
is
that
the
government
in
its
brief
has
attempted
to
distinguish
ryan
and
therefore
we
have
to
go
outside
of
ryan
because
of
the
fact
that
ryan
went
off
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
contract.
we
have
no
contract.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
that's
quite
true,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
well,
each
case
has
narrowed
it
down
very
considerably
so
we
have
this
case
in
1962,
the
ellerman
lines
case
and
the
waterman
and
mcnamara
case
and
it's
a
very,
very
thin
shred
of
a
contract
that's
left
but
yet
the
government
ceases
to
--
insist
in
placing
considerable
importance
there.
therefore,
we
have
to
go
outside
and
find
another
explanation
besides
the
contract.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
mr.
chief
justice,
i'll
be
very
brief.
i
just
wanted
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
two
recent
cases
decided
by
this
court
which
further
go
on
--
defined
the
ryan
case
and
makes
the
account
warranty
indemnity
theory
to
be
a
very
thin
one
and
we
did
not
cite
them
in
our
brief,
that's
waterman
steamship
corporation
versus
dugan
&
mcnamara
decided
in
1960
and
atlantic
&
gulf
stevedores
versus
ellerman
lines
decided
april
2,
1962.
the
only
comment
which
i
would
like
to
make
in
reply
to
government's
argument
is
that
he
tempts
to
--
attempted
to
minimize
the
importance
of
these
third
party
actions
and
that
it
wasn't
congress'
intent
to
consider
them
because
they
were
relatively
unimportant
but
they're
tremendously
important
and
that's
illustrated
by
the
whole
series
of
cases
of
this
court
starting
with
the
ryan
case.
and
they're
tremendously
important
if
the
court
will
think
of
the
factual
situations
that
can
be
involved
with
this
doctrine
as
set
forth
in
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion.
and
this
case
is
permitted
to
stand
where
the
private
shipowner
coming
in
to
a
mutual
fault
collision
with
a
government
vessel
will
be
required
to
absorb
all
of
the
damages
above
the
compensatory
payments
accruing
on
the
government
vessel
and
they
could
be
a
very
tremendous
amount.
so
that
the
matter
can't
be
just
brushed
with
--
brushed
off
on
the
basis
that
these
third
party
actions
weren't
--
aren't
important
and
therefore
they
weren't
considered
by
congress.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
well,
it's
historic
doctrine,
it
goes
way
back
and
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
prevent
the
injustices
that
would
accrue
if
the
straight
rule
of
contributory
negligence
were
applied.
for
this
reason
mr.
justice
white,
to
take
by
way
of
illustration.
one
vessel
is
damaged
very
extensively
and
we
will
say
for
the
purposes
of
illustration,
she
suffered
damaged
of
$2
million.
we
would
say
that
the
other
vessel
which
came
in
to
collision
with
her
suffered
no
damages
at
all.
but
she
was
equally
at
fault
and
in
violation
of
the
duty
to
refrain
from
negligence
as
far
--
in
her
navigation
as
far
as
that
vessel.
well,
if
you
apply
to
contributory
negligence
rule
as
we
have
it
in
common
law,
the
vessel
sought
having
sustained
all
the
damages
but
equally
at
fault
would
be
in
a
very
weak
position
and
it
could
cause
a
bankruptcy
or
insolvency
of
that
shipowner.
so
through
the
years
and
it
goes
back
to
--
really,
i
think
to
the
days
in
england
when
they
first
--
they
were
trying
to
encourage
people
to
invest
in
ocean
shipping.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
this
court
first
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
--
recognized
it
formally
in
the
--
where
it
was
defined
in
the
case
of
the
catharine
in
1854
and
it
was
further
recognized
by
the
court
in
the
north
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
well,
subsequently
after
the
adoption
by
this
court
of
the
mutual
fault
doctrine
of
divided
damages
and
later
on
in
history,
the
british
courts
evolved
a
system
of
apportionment
of
damages
based
on
degrees
of
fault.
and
that
was
never
accepted
in
this
country
although
arguments
were
made
along
that
line
in
the
case
of
the
chattahoochee
and
the
doctrine
was
rejected
in
the
chattahoochee.
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
well,
chattahoochee
mr.
justice
brennan
was
decided
in
connection
with
construction
of
the
harter
act
and
i
should
have
it
here
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
well,
what
i
was
looking
for
mr.
justice
goldberg
is
to
see
if
we
had
here
the
date
when
the
decision
was
handed
down.
but
in
any
event,
starting
with
the
chattahoochee,
all
of
decisions
since
then
have
uniformly
accepted
it
one
after
the
other,
the
canadian
aviator
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
(inaudible)
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
they
were
--
mr.
henry
r.
rolph
they've
always
been
considered
--
employee
--
any
personal
injury
or
loss
of
life
has
always
been
considered
to
be
a
proper
item
of
damages
in
a
mutual
fault
collision
to
be
added
into
the
total
damages
resulting
from
the
collision.
and
the
government
up
until
the
time
of
this
case
has
settled
many,
many
cases
on
that
basis
including
this
benevolence
case
which
had
never
actually
went
into
litigation.
we
settled
on
that
basis
and
that
formula
has
been
applied
uniformly
down
through
the
years
so
that
it
--
the
--
there's
no
question
but
that
it
applies
to
the
personal
injuries
as
well
as
the
death
cases,
which
resulted
from
collisions,
mr.
justice
white.
and
the
--
in
closing,
i
just
want
to
point
out
as
we
have
in
the
brief
that
the
state
courts
have
uniformly
recognized
the
rights
of
third
parties
in
construing
these
compensation
acts
in
rights
over
against
the
employers
and
we've
cited
the
various
cases
in
the
matter,
in
our
brief
including
the
leading
case
from
california,
baugh
versus
rogers.
with
that,
i
thank
the
court
for
its
attention.
