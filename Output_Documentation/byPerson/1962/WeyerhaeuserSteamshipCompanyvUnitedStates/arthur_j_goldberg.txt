mr.

justice
arthur
j.

how
about
--
if
we
have
to
draw
this
connection,
when
the
--
we
haven't
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
would
assume
that
you
will
reach
that,
is
that
right?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
rolph,
before
you
do
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
outside
the
fact
that
the
government
was
a
party
to
this,
and
in
fact
there's
a
difference,
would
you
say
clearly
it's
pretty
much
this
case?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
mr.
mondello,
is
there
an
excerpt
over
the
amount
of
payment
that's
gotten
into
--
that
the
worker
gets
from
it?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
the
surplus
had
prevented
him,
the
worker
itself.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
if
it's
a
third
party?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
the
government
--
they
were
not
entitled
to
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
all
suits
against
the
united
states.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
oh,
let
me
actually
ask
you
these,
will
you
take
time
--
when
it's
contemplated
that
--
has
it
been
in
the
workmen
provision
suit
against
the
united
with
different
amounts
and
has
it
been
in
a
third
party
action,
the
workmen's
fee
on
a
third
party
action,
in
the
united
states
liability
(inaudible)
is
that
what
you're
argument
means?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
except,
don't
you
have
to
make
the
exception?
well
in
those
cases,
they
are
not
a
vogue,
traditional
underlying
doctrine
of
sharing
the
responsibility.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
statute
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
are
you
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
wouldn't
that
be
arguable
under
this
statute,
the
terms
of
the
government
under
the
rule,
the
liability
of
the
united
states
court?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
does
that
review
--
what
should
that
point?
