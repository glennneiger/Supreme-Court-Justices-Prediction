mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
liability
of
united
states
on
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act
is
a
complete
substitute
for
any
and
all
tort
liabilities
that
it
might
otherwise
owe
a
third
party
arising
out
of
injury
to
a
federal
employee.
our
argument
in
brief
is
that
congress
has
given
us
the
fullest
indication
in
the
language
of
section
7
(b)
and
in
the
legislative
history
which
brought
that
language
into
being.
and
in
the
legislative
history
in
terms
of
the
basic
act
of
1916
that
any
sharing
by
the
united
states
of
the
burden
of
a
tort
liability,
any
exposure
to
the
hazards
of
large
tort
verdicts
arising
out
of
an
employment
injury
would
violate
the
most
basic
purposes
of
the
compensation
schemes.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
the
thrust
of
our
argument,
your
honor,
is
precisely
that.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute.
i'd
like
to
review
them
very
briefly.
in
1955,
the
s.s.
weyerhaeuser
and
the
army
dredge
pacific
collided.
this
action
was
thereafter
brought
by
petitioner
against
united
states
under
the
public
vessels
act.
on
cross
libel,
the
district
court
found
that
the
collision
occurred
through
the
mutual
fault
of
the
two
vessels
and
the
damages
suffered
by
each
party
was
stipulated
and
the
only
disputed
item
involved
the
liability
of
united
states,
the
contribution
to
the
amount
of
the
settlement
with
--
which
petitioner
had
made
with
reynold
ostrom,
the
federal
employee
aboard
the
pacific
who
had
suffered
the
personal
injury
in
the
collision.
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
amount
of
the
settlement
was
an
item
of
provable
damage
to
which
the
united
states
had
to
contribute
in
the
division
of
damages
and
the
final
degree
incorporating
that
ruling
was
entered.
on
the
appeal
of
the
united
states,
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
that
decision
holding
instead
that
the
exclusive
liability
provisions
of
section
7
(b)
of
the
compensation
act
precluded
contribution
by
the
united
states
on
account
of
an
injury
to
one
of
its
employee.
it's
not
very
much
that
we
can
say
about
the
plain
language
and
the
meaning
of
section
7
(b).
to
us,
its
meaning
is
clear
and
it
prohibits
contribution
to
any
tort
liability
with
respect
to
the
injury
to
a
federal
employee.
petitioner
sees
it
otherwise
but
we
suggest
that
the
meaning
which
you
must
give
that
language
can
best
be
determined
from
an
understanding
of
the
basic
policy
that
congress
wrote
into
the
compensation
act.
and
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
that
immediately.
our
argument
on
that
score
is
in
two
parts.
the
first
part
of
which
seems
to
us
strong
and
clear;
the
second
of
which
presents
a
good
deal
more
difficultly
for
us.
the
first
part
of
the
argument
is
devoted
to
the
question
whether
the
liability
of
united
states
to
pay
compensation
under
the
act
can
be
increased
because
of
the
inclusion
in
the
act
of
the
employee's
right
to
sue
third
parties.
we'll
show
first
as
to
that
that
the
liability
of
united
states
when
it
alone
is
negligent
was
very
carefully
regulated
by
the
congress,
and
involves
the
balance
of
competing
interest
which
lies
at
the
heart
of
every
workmen's
compensation
act.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
yes.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
increase.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
i
think
that's
so,
your
honor,
yes.
we
will
then
show
from
the
history
of
the
reimbursement
provisions
of
compensation
act
that
first
they
were
not
intended
to
affect
these
more
basic
rights
of
the
parties.
and
second,
that
the
employee's
right
to
recover
any
amount
in
excess
of
the
statutory
compensation
was
viewed
as
being
less
important
to
the
compensation
scheme
than
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
be
reimbursed.
our
conclusion
from
this
will
be
that
the
right
to
sue
third
parties
cannot
result
in
increasing
beyond
the
statutory
terms,
the
liability
of
the
united
states.
in
short,
united
states
owes
no
more
when
it
and
another
are
at
fault
then
it
owes
when
it
is
solely
at
fault
with
respect
to
an
injury.
the
second
major
part
of
our
argument
will
attempt
to
answer
the
questions
whether
the
united
states
gets
off
scot-free
so
to
speak
when
it
shares
its
mutual
fault
or
whether
it
must
first
--
it
must
instead
contribute
to
the
extent
of
its
statutory
liability.
in
effect,
the
bacille
case
situation.
we
start
with
this
where
congress
started
when
it
said
about
in
1915
and
1916
on
the
hearings
to
consider
what
could
be
done
to
improve
the
plight
of
the
disabled
federal
employee.
it
was
well
known
then
that
workmen's
compensation
acts
are
designed
to
serve
two
basic
purposes.one
is
to
provide
for
employees
a
sure
remedy
which
is
both
expeditious,
and
independent
of
proof
of
fault.
the
other
is
to
provide
for
employers
a
liability
which,
though
absolute
in
terms
of
fault,
is
limited
and
determinant
free
in
a
word
from
the
hazards
--
the
former
hazards
of
large
tort
verdicts.
these
two
purposes
were
congress'
purposes
in
1916
when
in
passing
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act,
it
chose
to
follow
the
pattern
established
by
the
best
there
could
then
be
found
in
the
various
state
acts
and
particularly
had
it
on
that
in
new
york
state.
the
legislative
history
testifies
overwhelmingly
to
the
existence
of
both
these
major
purposes.
proponents
of
the
measure
were
intent
on
providing
federal
employees
a
swift,
economical,
and
assured
compensation
for
injury
arising
out
of
employment
regardless
of
the
negligence
of
the
employee
or
that
of
his
fellow
servants,
and
regardless
of
the
lack
of
fault
of
the
united
--
on
the
part
of
united
states.
and
in
exchange
for
this
assumption
of
liability
without
fault
that
was
reserved
to
the
united
states,
a
limitation
as
to
the
types
and
amounts
of
damages
recoverable
for
employment
connected
injury.
it's
of
interest
to
note
that
at
the
time
that
the
yielding
of
sovereign
immunity
then
to
this
limited
extent
occurred
at
the
time
when
the
united
states
unlike
most
employers
who
were
then
covered
under
compensation
acts
was
immune
from
any
tort
liability
to
its
employees
at
all.
we
have
recited
at
pages
13
and
14
of
our
brief
some
statements
from
the
debate
which
point
out
the
terms
of
this
hard
fought
bargain
for
compromise
for
employees,
a
measured
long-range
system
of
assured
compensation
for
the
united
states,
an
absolute
but
limited
liability,
both
of
them
available
regardless
of
fault.
this
is
the
same
compromise
that
exists
at
the
heart
of
every
workmen's
compensation
act.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
now
--
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
well,
that's
a
different
part
of
the
--
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
yes,
your
honor.
i'll
take
that
up
when
i
discuss
the
bacille
--
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
well,
i'd
like
to
get
to
the
next
set
of
provisions
in
the
statute
which
congress
put
there
too
at
the
same
time
it
was
doing
this
back
in
1916
which
has
bearing
on
that.
in
1916,
the
act
also
was
made
to
contain
provisions
concerning
third
parties
and
the
right
to
recover
through
an
action
against
third
parties.
these
provisions
are
sections
26
and
27
of
the
act.
we
placed
them
at
--
reproduced
them
at
pages
37
and
38
of
the
government's
brief.
when
you
examine
them,
you
find
that
they
are
explicit
and
detailed.
they
contain
mandatory
instructions
that
the
reimbursement
to
the
united
states
of
any
compensation
it
has
paid
is
a
first
charge
on
any
recovery
from
the
third
party
made
by
the
employee
or
made
on
his
behalf
by
the
united
states.
to
ensure
this
priority
of
payment,
the
united
states
authorized
to
require
an
injured
employee
to
assign
to
it
his
cause
of
action
against
the
third
party.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
section
33
is
a
companion
provision,
i
think
it
is
true
there
also,
your
honor.
these
reimbursement
terms
are
written
to
apply
across
the
board.
they
apply
to
every
recovery
against
the
third
party
libel
and
damages
for
the
injury.
but
the
obvious
purpose
of
these
provisions
was
commented
on
by
this
court
in
dahn
v.
davis,
a
case
which
we've
cited
at
page
18
of
our
brief
where
the
court
said
plainly
by
these
two
sections
and
i'm
quoting
now,
“congress
deals
with
the
liability
of
persons
other
than
the
united
states
to
employees
entitled
to
compensation
under
the
act
not
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
that
compensation
but
for
the
purpose
of
reimbursing
the
government
for
payments
made
and
of
indemnifying
it
against
other
amounts
payable
in
the
future.”
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
the
provisions
of
the
reimbursement
sections
are
that
while
he
can
get
the
recovery,
yes,
the
amount
of
the
recovery
less
the
expenses
it
cost
him
to
get
it
are
applied
for
the
benefit
of
the
united
states
as
a
credit
against
any
payments
that
may
have
to
make
in
the
future.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
well,
there
can't
be
any
--
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
i'm
sorry,
your
honor
i
don't
--
there
can
be
no
surplus
after
that.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
the
typical
situation
covered
by
the
reimbursement
provision
is
that
the
employee
recovers
from
the
third
party,
makes
reimbursements
of
united
states
precisely
as
was
under
this
case.
and
any
balance
remaining
to
him,
less
deductions
for
the
expense
of
what
it
cost
him
to
get
that
money
in,
he
keeps
the
dollar
but
a
credit
is
setup
on
the
books
of
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
yes,
because
the
government's
liability
for
compensation
persists
along
as
the
disability
does
and
he
may
well
take
it
up
in
the
future
years
since.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
well,
we
start
with
the
ideas
that
he
gets
the
surplus
and
he
gets
it
immediately,
yes.
it's
clear
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
that
congress'
primary
concern
was
the
definition
of
the
change,
rights
and
liabilities
of
the
united
states
and
its
employees
which
were
brought
about
by
the
elimination
of
fault
as
a
consideration
between
them
and
compensation
for
injury.
the
primary
result,
we
know,
was
swift
in
certain
compensation
for
the
employee,
limited
though
absolute
liability
for
the
united
states.
it's
also
clear
that
the
retention
of
the
employee's
right
to
sue
a
third
party
was
a
relatively
incidental
matter
to
the
congress.
when
congress
provided
the
carefully
regulated
compensation
scheme,
it
effectively
decided
that
this
was
far
more
important
and
beneficial
to
the
employee
than
the
illusory
right
to
seek
a
large
tort
verdict
from
the
government.
at
the
same
time,
there
was
no
reason
to
allow
a
third
party
to
benefit
from
these
arrangements
to
which
he
was
a
stranger,
hence
there
was
opposition
expressed
to
the
retention
of
the
employee's
right
to
sue
a
third
party.
but
as
we've
seen
in
the
reimbursement
provisions,
the
real
limit
of
congress'
concern
in
dealing
with
a
third
party
was
to
ensure
that
any
recovery
would
be
applied
to
the
credit
of
the
united
states
against
its
payment
of
either
past
or
future
compensation.
we
conclude
from
this
that
since
congress,
through
the
reimbursement
provisions
has
prevented
the
employee
from
enjoying
any
tort
recovery
until
the
united
states
has
first
recovered
it's
compensation
payment,
its
statutory
liability,
that
it
follows
quite
naturally
--
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
but
it
follows
from
this
quite
naturally
that
no
employee
would
be
allowed
to
increase
his
recovery
by
a
tort
action
if
the
result
would
be
to
impose
upon
the
united
states
a
liability
in
excess
of
that
imposed
by
the
act.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
my
difficulty
with
that
your
honor
is
that
what
congress
did,
it
put
in
to
the
reimbursement
provisions
and
it
didn't
seem
to
have
this
design
in
doing
so.
but
if
this
is
so,
then
there's
no
warrant
in
the
statute
or
its
history
for
believing
that
congress
would
have
tolerated
through
the
indirect
mechanism
of
a
third
party
suit.
a
result
of
it
faced
directly
and
squarely
prohibits.
we
submit
that
the
basic
terms
and
policies
of
the
act
prohibit
the
subjection
of
united
states
to
a
greater
liability
when
it
and
another
party
are
both
negligent
than
when
it
alone.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
i
will
show
too,
your
honor.
one
final
note
on
this,
the
basic
policy
of
congress
has
placed
in
the
compensation
scheme
generally
and
in
the
reimbursement
provisions.
as
we've
noticed,
the
reimbursement
provisions
permit
the
united
states
after
an
assignment
to
the
--
of
the
employees'
claim
to
bring
the
suit
against
a
third
party
on
behalf
of
the
employee.
now,
contributions
were
allowable.
this
places
the
united
states
in
the
awkward
position
of
suing
for
a
judgment
half
of
which
would
be
executable
against
itself.
this
is
an
odd
procedure
to
say
the
least
and
you
think
that
had
this
kind
of
procedure
has
been
in
the
contemplation
of
congress.
you'd
expect
to
find
something
about
it
in
the
reimbursement
provisions.
it's
not
there
and
we
think
it's
significant
that
it
means
that
congress
didn't
contemplate
this
kind
of
arrangement.
that
the
united
states
was
to
be
free
of
tort
liability
in
this
fashion.
now,
to
this
point,
we
have
no
difficulty
with
the
argument
that
no
liability
in
excess
of
the
amount
of
statutory
liability
should
be
visited
upon
the
united
states.
we
must
admit,
however,
that
a
more
difficult
question
is
presented,
that
the
petitioner's
thrust
is
directed
at
only
the
amount
that
is
the
statutory
liability
of
the
united
states
under
the
compensation
act.
we're
faced
as
petitioner
reminds
us
with
the
availability
to
him
in
other
circumstances
of
a
case
law
rule
of
contribution,
the
moiety
rule,
divided
damages
rule.
and
we've
tried
to
asses
whether
there
can
be
any
accommodation
among
the
relationships
of
the
third
party,
the
employee
and
united
states,
which
wouldn't
disturb
the
more
fundamental
purposes
of
the
compensation
act.
we've
--
we
have
found
only
three
reconciliations
and
while
we
have
stated
them
at
some
detail
in
our
brief,
i'd
like
merely
to
mention
them
summarily
and
give
the
reason
why
they
seemed
to
us
to
be
inappropriate.
first,
you
--
the
congress
could
have
cut
off
the
employee's
right
of
action
against
a
negligent
third
party
or
could
have
limited
that
right
of
action.
it
didn't
and
for
two
reasons,
we
believe
this
alternative
as
a
judicial
compromise
is
unavailable.
for
one
thing,
congress
didn't
make
explicit
provisions
for
such
a
lawsuit
and
the
employee
is
entitled
to
have
it.
it
even
made
provisions
for
--
how
the
recovery
should
be
distributed
in
very
explicit
term
and
would
be
most
difficult
to
fashion
the
rule
which
would
limit
the
employee's
right
around
these
restrictions.
second,
such
an
alternative
would
interfere
with
the
well-established
right
of
an
innocent
third
party
to
recover
his
full
damages
from
either
of
two
wrongdoers
through
whose
fault
this
injury
occurred.
the
risks
and
burdens
of
obtaining
contribution
have
always
been
placed
by
courts
on
the
wrongdoer
who
is
sued
so
the
employee
shouldn't
be
put
to
that
verdict.
the
second
possible
reconciliation
of
these
competing
interest
is
to
hold
the
united
states
liable
for
contribution
but
only
to
the
extent
of
a
statutory
liability.
this
is
the
alternative
--
it
once
adopted
by
the
third
circuit
in
construing
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act
provisions,
which
are
in
this
respect
virtually
identical
to
those
of
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act,
in
the
bacille
case.
now,
there
are
many
difficulties
we
think
presented
by
this
approach.
first
of
all,
neither
the
longshoremen's
act
nor
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act
contains
any
authority
and
written
into
the
statute
for
such
a
tort
based
compromise.
each
one
provides
that
the
liability
under
that
act
is
the
exclusive
liability
and
if
those
words
mean
anything,
there
is
no
rational
way
to
convert
a
tort
liability
for
contribution
or
divided
damages
of
admiralty
into
a
liability
arising
under
the
act.
these
are
two
different
arrangements.
and
second,
the
reimbursement
provisions
of
both
these
compensation
acts
also
stand
in
the
way.
and
in
pope
&
talbot
v.
hawn,
we
cite
this
case
in
our
brief
at
page
22.
this
court
faced
the
contention
of
a
third
party
that
it
and
not
the
negligent
employer
should
have
the
benefit
of
a
reduction
in
liability
equivalent
to
the
statutory
liability
of
the
employer
under
the
compensation
act.
in
rejecting
this
contention,
the
court
pointed
to
the
specific
provisions
for
reimbursement
in
the
longshoremen's
act.
it
noted
that
the
contention
and
i'm
quoting,
“if
accepted
would
frustrate
this
purpose
to
protect
employers
who
are
subjected
to
absolute
liability
by
the
act.”
and
the
court
stated
that
the
contention
was
a
substantial
equivalent
of
contribution
which
it
had
declined
to
require
in
the
halcyon
cases.
and
finally
as
to
the
second
alternative
of
permitting
contribution
but
only
to
the
limit
of
united
states'
liability
under
the
act,
we've
noted
in
our
brief
a
number
of
practical
difficulties
that
suggest
that
the
adoption
of
this
alternative
would
probably
raise
a
good
many
more
problems
than
it
would
solve.
the
difficulty
arises
essentially
from
the
fact
that
congress
made
the
welfare
of
federal
employees
a
continuing
government
responsibility.
and
you
can't
discharge
that
responsibility.
the
united
states
cannot
effectively
by
the
commutation
of
future
benefits,
which
is
a
practice
which
by
implications
from
section
14
of
the
act
is
probably
not
available
anyway.
section
14
is
a
brief
section,
captioned
lump
sum
settlements
and
which
states
the
terms
under
which
the
bureau
of
employees'
compensation
is
authorized
to
make
lump
sum
settlements
typically
where
the
amounts
don't
exceed
in
this
$25
a
month
or
beneficiaries
about
to
leave
the
country.
but
a
very
limited
range
of
circumstances
and
it
was
certainly
not
within
congressional
contemplation
that
the
commutation
--
the
current
value
of
these
long
range
payments
to
support
families
of
the
disabled
employee
were
to
be
few
in
this
fashion.
these
practical
problems
are
intensified
by
the
normal
reluctance
of
courts
of
admiralty
to
enter
decrees
which
might
be
suitable
for
this
kind
of
long-range
administration
of
the
payment
of
compensation.
we
certainly
have
found
no
practicable
way
to
permit
contribution
to
this
limited
extent
and
to
insure
at
the
same
time
that
ultimately
the
united
states
won't
be
made
to
pay
something
more
than
its
share
of
the
liability
that
all
arises
we
think
as
the
result
of
fact
that
we
do
have
the
responsibility
to
pay
compensation
whenever
it
is
required
and
that
means
whenever
dis
--
until
disability
ceases
to
persist.
and
in
the
event
that
death
occurs
by
natural
consequence
from
the
injury
after
a
long
term,
we
then
have
to
continue
compensation
payments
to
widows
or
dependents.
it's
very
difficult
to
bring
all
these
short
range
into
a
precise
amount
of
money
payable
now.
the
third
and
last
alternative
which
is
that
of
requiring
the
negligent
third
party
like
petitioner
to
bear
the
entire
burden
of
the
damages
which
resulted
from
the
injury
is
the
only
one
which
is
totally
consistent
with
the
fundamental
purposes
of
the
--
of
purposes
and
the
language
of
the
federal
employees'
compensation
act
in
this
court's
decision,
decision
by
pope
&
talbot
v.
hawn.
now,
we
have
set
out
at
pages
25
to
30
of
our
brief,
the
cases
from
five
courts
of
appeals
which
have
construed
the
exclusive
liability
provision
of
section
7
(b)
or
the
equivalent
in
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers'
act,
section
5.
each
of
these
cases
involves
a
suit
by
a
third
party
against
the
compensation
paying
employer
where
the
third
party
claims
that
he
doesn't
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
employee,
the
representative
next
to
kin
and
so
on.
the
uniform
holdings
of
these
courts
are
that
the
third
party
suit
is
barred,
barred
by
the
plain
meaning
of
the
language
of
these
sections
and
the
fundamental
purposes
of
this
statute.
petitioner
has
referred
us
to
no
appellate
decisions
to
the
contrary.
we
have
found
none.
there's
nothing
i
wish
to
add
to
the
treatment
of
those
cases
as
they
are
handled
in
the
brief.
now,
as
to
the
indemnity
cases,
we
think
the
reliance
petitioner
places
on
those
is
misplaced
essentially
for
the
reason
that
they
defend
for
their
result
on
the
contractual
right
of
indemnity.
our
concern
here
in
this
case
--
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
i
remember
--
i
think
the
acceptance
by
the
majority
of
--
in
the
ryan
case
of
the
contractual
basis
for
the
decision
is
what
makes
it
stand.
and
there's
been
no
denial
of
this
basis
for
that
decision
in
the
cases
which
follow
it.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
i
think
you
bringing
the
action
can
label
it
anything
you
choose.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
i
think
you
would
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
well,
i
don't
regard
the
basis
as
thin
for
this
reason.
if
you
look
at
the
ryan
case
and
regard
the
right
of
action
there,
the
--
what
produced
the
result
in
ryan
we
say
is
the
contractual
element.
the
way
it
has
otherwise
been
stated
here
is
that
there
was
something
independent
that
went
on
about
ryan
that
caused
that
result.
now
to
us,
i
think
the
clearer
basis
for
decision
really
is
the
fact
that
a
contract
could
be
looked
at,
i
appreciate
it
was
not
written
but
an
implied
contract,
a
contract
implied
in
fact
of
that
variety
and
not
anything
by
operation
of
law
was
going
on
in
ryan
at
least
purportedly
and
certainly
in
the
later
cases
--
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
but
the
point
--
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
your
honor
is
that
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
plaintiff
calls
it.
it
matters
what
you
have
to
consider
it
for
whatever
purpose
you
have
before
you
when
you're
making
the
decision.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
no
sir.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
if
a
plaintiff
can
--
could
prevail
whether
he
sues
in
contract
or
sues
in
tort,
he
can
do
either
and
he
can
prevail.
but
if
there
are
other
considerations
for
the
court
that's
handling
that
suit,
other
matters
for
it
to
consider,
it
must
consider
those
matters
and
decide
within
that
framework,
within
that
context
whether
--
what
it
really
is
handling
is
a
tort
matter
or
what
its
handling
is
a
contact
matter.
now,
in
ryan
you
could
point
to
a
contract
implied
in
fact
which
is
what
it
was.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
i
think
it
shouldn't
because
of
the
problem
that
the
court
has
faced
rather
than
talk
about
the
ryan
case,
let's
--
i
want
to
talk
about
this
one
and
the
problem
that
we
have
here
--
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
you
have
the
language
of
section
7
(b)
and
that
language
doesn't
raise
any
questions
about
--
is
this
an
independent
kind
of
claim?
it
raises
very
direct
questions
in
terms
whether
--
whatever
you
call
the
claim,
is
it
a
claim
with
respect
to
an
injury
or
the
other
language
of
the
statute,
is
it
a
claim
brought
on
account
of
the
injury
and
the
critical
--
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
on
account
of
is
the
language
in
the
statute
whether
you
bring
the
claim
on
account
of
an
injury.
you
take
the
injury
to
ostrom
out
of
this
case
and
we
have
no
argument
with
petitioner,
none
whatever.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
we
--
you
take
the
injury
to
ostrom
out
of
this
case,
the
settlement
with
ostrom,
it
just
didn't
exist.
we
wouldn't
be
standing
here
arguing
with
petitioner
about
the
--
this
problem
which
highlights
the
fact
that
we're
here
because
of
the
injury
--
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
well,
ryan
in
the
later
cases
still
go
off
on
this
other
question.
in
ryan,
what
you
said
was,
there
is
between
the
two
parties
who
are
fighting
about
who's
going
to
pay
ultimately
--
a
contract,
a
different
relation,
a
relation
that
has
nothing
to
with
the
injury
necessarily.
now,
when
the
injury
arises
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
too
that
in
ryan,
this
was
a
full
recovery
over.
this
was
an
indemnification
of
the
type
which
is
known
also
to
the
law
and
probably
is
already
a
doctrine,
as
the
admiralty
doctrine,
or
the
contribution
doctrine
which
arose
under
the
common
law.
but
the
question
under
our
section
of
the
statute
is,
is
this
a
tort
liability?
and
more
specifically
we
get
to
the
language
of
the
section
which
is
at
page
3
of
the
government's
brief.
notice
that
it
winds
up
mentioning
that
the
proceedings
in
which
the
action
is
brought
can
be
those
in
admiralty
or
those
under
any
federal
tort
liability
statute.
now,
this
action
was
brought
under
the
public
vessel's
act.
i
don't
suppose
that
--
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
no,
none
whatever.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
my
point
is
that
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
the
public
vessel's
act,
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
are
all
regarded
as
waivers
of
jurisdiction
in
tort.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
all
suits
against
the
united
states
but
all
tort
cases.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
that
happens
to
be
the
necessary
effect
of
a
good
many
compensation
statutes.
the
state
statutes
contained
very
similar
provisions
to
these.
the
courts
have
openly
commented
about
the
fact
that
in
certain
limited
situations,
it's
true
the
compensation
paying
employer
in
effect
comes
off
scot-free
with
the
one
caveat,
i
suggested
before
that
the
compensation
paying
employer,
particularly
the
united
states
under
this
act
never
knows
when
it's
through.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
no,
i
--
that,
i
don't
think
you
need
to
accept
your
honor
because
i
don't
know
how
old
the
doctrine
of
contribution
at
common
law
after
the
common
law
courts
decided
it
was
not.
but
we've
had
contribution
in
some
states.
i
guess
it's
developed
as
a
result
of
development
of
common
law
now,
particularly
the
district
of
columbia.
in
most,
it
came
about
by
statute
but
it's
certainly
an
old,
old
doctrine
and
the
notion
of
sharing
for
a
mutual
fault
is
very,
very
old.
i
see
nothing
--
i
see
no
difference,
i
guess
it's
the
way
i
would
best
put
this,
i
see
no
difference
between
contribution
at
common
law
and
contribution
at
admiralty
law.
the
divided
damages
rule
for
--
however
many
other
names
it
has,
is
nothing
but
a
system
for
sharing
the
burden
of
loss
in
a
tort
incident.
now,
i
think
the
compensation
act
cut
across
all
tort
liability
of
this
sort
and
so
when
in
ryan,
he
went
off
on
a
contractual
basis.
i
think
you
did
this
because
you
had
to.
there
was
no
other
way
to
go
in
ryan.
so
long
as
ryan
appear
to
you
to
be
a
tort
case
you
had
to
follow
the
dictates
of
the
equivalent
of
section
7
because
it
purports
to
cut
off
and
in
the
broadest
terms,
all
tort
liability.
whatever
is
left
is
the
only
predicate
you
could
possibly
use
for
the
full
indemnity
over
that
occurred
in
ryan.
and
this
--
at
that
point
of
course,
you
stopped
talking
about
a
sharing
50-50
or
in
any
other
basis.
you
have
taken
the
entire
burden
over
which
is
the
--
also
an
old
doctrine
of
contractual
indemnity.
all
these
doctrines
run,
they've
been
running
for
a
long,
long
time.
but
in
1916,
congress
which
had
the
power
to
interfere
with
them
did
interfere
with
them.
and
it
did
so
in
language,
in
a
small
section
of
the
statute
in
broadest
terms
which
says
the
united
states
shall
not
undertake
under
this
act
tort
liability.
now,
if
you
can
make
of
--
the
only
way
you
could
find
the
way
out,
i
think
in
this
situation
would
be
to
make
of
the
admiralty
contribution
rule
something
other
than
tort
liability
and
that
i
don't
think
it
is.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
it's
a
difficult
case,
your
honor.
the
harter
act,
this
will
be
my
last
--
excuse
me.
we
think
the
analogy
to
the
harter
act
case
is
inappropriate
because
of
the
differences
really
between
the
harter
act
as
a
working
statute
in
this
compensation
act.
the
harter
act
settled
a
much
narrower
question
between
the
shipper
and
the
carrier
with
respect
to
cargo.
and
its
terms
and
its
legislative
history
and
the
expressions
about
those
terms
from
that
legislative
history
by
this
court
shows
that
it
was
never
designed
to
interfere
with
the
rights
of
third
parties.
you
have
literally
said
that,
you
said
it
in
delaware,
you
said
it
again
i
think
--
you
did
in
the
chattahoochee.
and
in
this,
that
statute
is
remarkably
different
from
the
compensation
act.
and
of
this,
you
should
have
no
doubt.
the
compensation
act
is
--
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
i
think
the
statute
--
the
statutory
terms
don't
purport
to
deal
with
third
parties
and
the
legislative
history
indications
are
that
there
was
this
very
narrow
arrangement
of
the
exculpation
from
liability
to
negligence.
that
the
congress
was
trying
to
correct
between
shipper
and
cargo
carriers
and
that's
all
that
congress
had
an
interest
at
that
point.
it
was
not
--
literally,
it
was
not
trying
to
affect
third
parties.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
but
more
often
--
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
no
sir.
you
cannot
argue
that
and
still
take
account
of
the
reimbursement
provisions
of
this
statute
because
in
this
statute
congress
did
talk
about
third
parties
and
decided
precisely
wanted
--
what
it
wanted
to
do
about
it.
you
don't
have
that
in
the
harter
act.
and
well,
we
submit
that
the
summation
of
the
factors
that
judge
learned
hand
used
in
the
matthews
case
where
he
denied
contribution
against
this
argument
about
the
analogy
to
the
harter
act
under
section
5
of
the
longshoremen
harbor
workers'
act
and
it
fits
like
a
glove
here
under
the
almost
precise
--
precisely
identical
language
of
section
7
(b)
of
the
compensation
act.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
no
sir.
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
yes,
it
is.
the
contribution
aspect
under
this
--
mr.
anthony
l.
mondello
--
case,
yes.
