really,
what
it
comes
down
to
is
you
want
to
back
away
from
the
limitation
the
government
relies
on
and
say
that
this
is
a
separate
admiralty
proceeding,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
as
far
--
what
this
other
statute
provide.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
they
want
to
say
now
that
the
application
of
mutual
fault
doctrine
or
apportionment
doctrine
means
that
you
have
to
read
it
in
connection
with
this
other
statute
and
that
being
so,
then
they
say
you
have
to
exclude
that
$16,000
from
the
division.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it
doesn't
make
much
here,
and
it's
how
you
put
it
--
whether
you
put
it
your
way
and
you
put
it
the
government's
way.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
real
problem
here,
from
the
government
standpoint
is
to
get
out
from
under
ryan,
isn't
it?
because
everything
you
said
up
to
date
was
argued
as
i
remember
it
in
ryan,
the
statute,
in
the
saying,
in
the
wording,
arguments
made,
the
same.
and
the
only
thing
i
can
find
in
your
brief
is
you
say
it's
contractual
in
that
case,
and
that's
the
difference
and
i
hope
you
come
to
what
that
mean
as
a
distinction.
