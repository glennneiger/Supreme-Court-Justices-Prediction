has
been
active
in
the

the
part
that

about
the
patent
office
and
discussed
about
the
commissioner
of
patents
(inaudible)

mr.

it's
your

that
he
can't
have
an
office
in
florida?
justice

no,
i
haven't
said
that.
can
this
man
(inaudible)
patent
office
have
an
office
in
florida,
what's
your
argument?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
alright.
now,
if
he
can
have
an
office
there,
if
he
can
rent
an
office,
what
can
he
do
in
that
office
consistent
with
the
florida

that
you
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
considering
any
patent
application
to
the

what
do
you
do
outside

pay
rent?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so,
what
you're
saying
now
(inaudible)
what
you're
saying
now
is
he
cannot
have
a
lease
or
rent
an
office.
he
could
work
in
a
corporation
if
he's
under
the
supervision
of
a
lawyer.
now,
(inaudible)
what
could
he
do
independently?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
suppose
he
says
--
now
supposedly,
i
am
not
a
lawyer
and
i
am
an
agent
of
the
patent
bar
and
owning
to
both
to
--
by
applications
before
the
patent
office,
not
every
lawyer
(inaudible)
what's
your
view
there?
justice

j.
goldberg
in

he
could
not
have
(inaudible)
within
the
patent
office
within
florida,
in
this

unless
--
regardless
of
the

what
might
be
fully
advised
unless
he
operates
under
the
(inaudible)
of
a
lawyer.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
then
your
statement
concludes
it,
but
i
am
trying
to
get
to
the
facts.
he
could
not
operate
in
a
limited
area
on
filing
applications
or
letters
for
patent
to
the
patent
office
from
florida
(inaudible)
regarding
