justice
john
m.
harlan
does
this
record
show
one
way
or
the
other
whether
mr.
sperry
ever
attempted
to
take
the
bar
--
the
florida
bar
examination?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
any
bar
examination?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
say
you
objected
to
three?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
depends
what
the
documents
are.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
most
--
are
there
any
figures
that
indicate
how
much
of
the
business
in
the
patent
office
handled
by
people
who
are
registered
attorneys
as
distinguished
in
patent
agents.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
to
whether
the
business
tends
to
flow
on
one
direction
or
the
other,
it
has
no
trend
or
you
don't?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
not
suggesting,
as
i
understand
it
in
your
argument
--
(inaudible)
your
argument
that
under
florida
law,
what
your
client
did,
constituted
under
florida
law
the
practice
of
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it
maybe
that
florida
has
no
right
to
do
what
it's
done
but
it
surely
has
the
right
to
say
what
is
the
--
what
is
practice
of
law
and
within
the
meaning
of
the
florida
statutes?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
what
i
thought
the
real
question
in
this
case
was
whether
the
federal
statute
in
effect
preempts
florida's
right
to
say
that
you
can't
do
this
without
becoming
a
member
of
the
bar
under
florida
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
we'll
put
it
in
another
way.
this
case
comes
here
with
a
finding
by
the
highest
court
of
florida
that
what
is
being
done
here
violates
their
practice
of
law
statutes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
we
certainly
have
to
accept
that
determination,
don't
we?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
is
that
where
the
point
(voice
overlap)
is
--
that
doesn't
end
the
case
as
far
as
you're
concerned
obviously
but
that's
the
point
of
departure
that
we
have
to
move
on
from,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
black
perhaps
i
misapprehended
the
thrust
of
it.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
things
you
thought
that
florida
had
no
right
to
interfere
with
were
number
five
which
was
the
preparation
of
applications
for
--
to
those
patents,
would
you
--
you
go
beyond
that,
i
take
it,
you
say
that
they
can
give
opinions
and
draw
contracts
within
the
field
of
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
what
pertains
to
applications?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they're
horrible
things
to
read.
i
know.
i've
read
a
lot
of
them
--
you
go
beyond
that,
you
go
beyond
that,
don't
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
do
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words
supposing
these
decree
were
cut
down,
let
me
put
it
specifically
to
you,
to
limit
--
limited
simply
to
five,
would
you
be
satisfied
with
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
same
rules,
if
i
mean
one
