j.
brennan,

(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
was
it
initiated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
preparation
of
introduction
of
evidence
at
first.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
deposition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
agent
or
would
your
client
do
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
of
the
--
any
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unless
the
board
(inaudible)
whatever,
your
position
basically
as
i
understand
it
is
that
--
can
federal
preemption
here,
whatever
the
activities
maybe
defined
as
under
florida
law
as
bringing
them
within
the
practice
of
the
law,
nevertheless
to
the
extent
of
the
federal
statutes,
permit
the
patent
office
to
permit
agents
to
do
things.
to
that
extent,
florida
is
powerless
to
prevent
it.
they're
being
done
in
florida.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
what
--
well,
then
what
--
i
don't
understand
why
you're
--
you're
so
willing
to
concede
the
wording
of
this
injunction
in
any
form
if
basically
it's
a
problem
of
preemption.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
the
patent
office
defines
what
these
agents
may
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
preparing,
drafting,
construing
legal
documents
in
this
context,
if
permitted
under
patent
office
regulations
could
be
done
by
patent
agents,
i
would
suppose
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
should
think
you
would.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
your
point,
mr.
vom
baur
that
all
that
he's
been
enjoined
from
doing,
he's
doing
it
--
doing
these
things
in
florida.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
i
thought
one
of
his
arguments
was
that
he's
practicing
before
the
patent
office
when
he's
doing
these
things
in
florida.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
--
say
mr.
vom
baur
that
he
--
he
might
take
employment
with
a
florida
law
firm
in
general
practice
and
do
their
patent
application
work
for
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
would
--
what
would
the
lawyers
in
general
practice
know
about
--
especially
in
patent
applications.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
that
to
say
then
that
the
only
employment
he
could
take
would
be
with
some
law
office
doing
a
patent
law
of
business.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
with
some
firm
in
general
practice.
