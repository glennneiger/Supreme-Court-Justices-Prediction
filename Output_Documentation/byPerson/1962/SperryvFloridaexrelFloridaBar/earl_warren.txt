state
of
florida
on
the
relationship
of
the
florida
bar.
mr.
moore.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
the
patent
bureau
call
them
now
since
they
no
longer
called
them
attorneys?
chief
justice
earl
warren
patent
agents.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
object
to
three?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
take
that
this
is
broad
enough
to
prevent
him
from
drafting
an
application
for
a
patent.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
five.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
--
is
the
patent
application
a
legal
document?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
the
preparation
of
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
patents
â€“
customs
and
patent
appeals
be
a
legal
document?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
questioning
what
you're
contending.
i'm
just
trying
to
see
whether
this
number
three
preparing,
drafting,
and
construing
legal
documents
would
prevent
you
from
doing
certain
things.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
court
of
patent
appeals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
concede
that
there
must
be
a
lawyer
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
rules
say
what
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
can't
take
depositions,
can
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
probably
so,
do
they
not,
don't
they
have
agents
all
over
the
country
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
who
are
qualified
to
act
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
doesn't
the
--
doesn't
the
regulation
of
the
bureau
provide
that
they
shall
not
do
it
by
public
appearance
in
washington
that
they
shall
--
they
shall
deal
with
the
bureau
by
mail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
let's
talk
about
--
let's
talk
about
the
normal
practice
and
what
they
--
what
they
ask
their
agents
to
do.
do
they
not
encourage
them
to
deal
with
the
bureau
by
correspondence
and
not
by
personal
appearance
before
the
patent
bureau?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
don't
they
suggest
it
in
their
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
they
suggest
it
in
their
rules?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
admits
that
he
can't
go
before
the
patent
appeals.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
yes,
i
agree.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
in
preparing
an
application
for
a
patent,
he
would
have
to
do
it
under
the
supervision
of
a
florida
lawyer
and
when
it
came
to
presenting
it
to
the
--
the
patent
office,
the
florida
lawyer
would
have
to
do
it
under
the
supervision
of
this
man.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
say
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
say
that
superciliously
but
isn't
that
true
as
you
state
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
are
there
in
texas
who
are
lawyers
who
are
--
not
detected
within
florida
who
were
so
qualified?
i
read
from
your
brief
that
there
are
73
in
the
state
of
florida,
73
lawyers
who
were
qualified
to
act
before
the
commission,
is
that
not
correct?
