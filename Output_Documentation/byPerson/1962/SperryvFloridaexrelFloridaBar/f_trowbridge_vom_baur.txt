mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
probably
the
first
unauthorized
practice
case
to
be
argued
in
this
court.
and
in
my
view
of
the
petitioner's
contentions
raised
a
number
of
serious
legal
questions.
and
as
a
result,
i
have
a
fair
amount
of
materials
to
try
to
get
out
in
30
minutes
and
accordingly
i
will
endeavor
to
present
my
argument
in
more
or
less
outlined
form.
now,
there
are
certain
facts
which
the
petitioners
did
not
mention
of
which
i
think
are
material
to
the
case.
the
solicitor
general
states
in
his
brief
that
the
petitioner
here
had
practiced
in
florida
for
many
years.
this
is
incorrect.
the
petitioner
moved
to
florida
in
1958.
and
there
he
proceeded
to
rent
an
office
on
the
first
national
bank
building
of
tampa
and
to
advertise
himself
on
the
office
door
as
a
patent
attorney.
and
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
petitioner
admitted
in
his
brief
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
which
i
have
here,
that
the
term
‘patent
attorney',
quote,
“implies
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
florida
bar.”
then
he
proceeded
to
advertise
himself
in
august,
1960
in
the
classified
directory
of
the
telephone
book
as
a
patent
attorney.
and
properly
thereafter,
in
february
1961,
the
unauthorized
practice
committee
of
the
florida
bar
got
after
him
and
sued
him,
sued
to
enjoin
the
unlawful
practice
of
law
by
the
petitioner.
now
here's
what
the
petitioner
did
in
florida.
first,
he
rendered
legal
opinions
as
to
infringement
and
as
to
patentability.
secondly,
he
prepared
patent
applications.
third,
he
prepared
legal
documents,
specifically
license
agreements,
and
he
was
admitted
in
the
court
below,
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
page
2
of
the
record,
that
the
petitioner
quote,
“holds
himself
out
to
the
public
as
authorized
to
engage
in
the
practice
of
law
in
the
patent
field.”
in
short,
this
is
a
holding
out
case.
now,
in
the
decision
below,
as
it
has
already
been
indicated,
the
court
below
held
that
each
of
the
acts
in
question
committed
by
the
petitioner,
constituted
the
practice
of
law.
and
the
court
also
held
that
the
practice
of
law
or
rather
the
practice
of
patent
law
was
the
practice
of
law
because
the
petitioner
argued
in
the
court
below
that
the
practice
of
patent
law
was
not
the
practice
of
law.
now
it
has
also
been
indicated
but
not
quite
specifically
enough,
the
petitioner
here
does
not
contest
the
entire
decree
below.
he
does
not
assert
a
right
to
continue
to
use
the
term
‘patent
attorney'
or
to
continue
to
hold
himself
out
as
a
lawyer.
now,
he
does
not
assert
the
right
to
continue
to
repair
legal
documents
and
notably
license
agreements,
and
he
does
not
assert
the
right
to
otherwise
engage
in
the
practice
of
law,
and
notably
trademark
practice
which
is
also
covered
by
the
record.
and
here,
we
come
close
to
the
point
of
the
case
perhaps
of
the
issue.
as
i
read
his
reply
brief
at
page
2,
he
does
not
assert
a
right
to
give
legal
opinions
as
to
infringement
and
patentability
if
unconnected
with
the
preparation
of
patent
opinions,
but
he
does
assert
a
right
to
give
legal
opinions
as
to
infringement
and
patentability
if
connected
with
the
preparation
of
patent
opinions
--
patent
applications,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
yes,
sir,
i
used
the
wrong
word,
patent
applications.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
yes,
sir,
i
think
that
is
a
fair
statement.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
yes,
sir,
and
here
we're
coming
so
closer
to
the
--
to
the
fine
point
of
case
because
the
petitioner
contends
in
this
court,
his
brief
as
replete
with
statement
to
this
effect
that
what
the
court
below
did
was
to
enjoin
him
“from
practice
before
the
patent
office”.
now,
i
submit
to
this
court,
that
is
not
a
fair
commentary
on
the
decision
below
that
the
court
below
did
not
enjoin
the
petitioner
from
practice
before
the
patent
office,
and
i
will
state
my
reasons
why
it
did
not.
in
the
first
place,
there
is
no
language
in
the
opinion
below
which
is
susceptible
of
any
such
interpretation.
secondly,
the
only
acts
which
took
place,
which
were
enjoined
by
the
court
below
took
place
in
florida
and
it
is
noteworthy
that
--
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
this
is
part
of
my
point.
it's
not
--
it
is
not
the
whole
story.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
this
is
what
he
says
and
this
is
what
i
am
endeavoring
to
rebut.
i'm
just
proceeding
to
that
point
now
if
i
could
continue
with
it.
in
short,
my
point
here
that
i'm
now
endeavoring
to
make
is
that
the
court
below
did
not
enjoin
him
from
practicing
the
board
of
patent
law.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
yes,
sir,
the
court
specifically
said
the
contrary
of
that
--
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
they
say
--
the
court
said
the
issuance
of
this
injunction
and
i
think
i
can
quote
it
will
not
in
any
sense
interfere
with
the
right
of
the
petitioner
to
practice
before
the
patent
office
in
washington
d.c.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
if
it
is
a
practice
before
the
patent
office,
i
deny,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
it
is
and
i
would
still
like
to
try
to
get
out
my
reasons
as
to
why
if
i
may,
sir.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
that
is
an
interesting
question,
mr.
justice
warren,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
--
well,
the
petitioner
here
makes
that
statement
in
his
brief.
that
in
fact,
in
reading
his
brief,
one
has
the
impression
i
think,
that
no
personal
appearances
are
ever
necessary
before
the
patent
office
and
perhaps
it
never
even
take
place.
the
contrary
is
--
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
i
cannot
answer
as
to
whether
they
encourage
it
but
i
can
say
is
--
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
--
the
rule
of
the
patent
office
--
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
well,
they
say
something
about
all
correspondence
should
be
carried
on
by
mail,
but
the
point
i
would
like
to
make
in
answer
to
your
question
is,
that
the
patent
office
rules
which
is
a
fairly
voluminous
document
here
provide
specifically
for
a
number
of
personal
appearances
in
the
patent
office,
such
as
interviews
with
examiners
under
patent
rule
133,
an
oral
hearing
or
oral
argument
before
the
board
of
patent
appeals.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
no,
this
is
the
board
of
patent
appeals
in
the
patent
office,
sir.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
and
these
are
things
which
take
place
in
the
patent
office
in
which
i
think
constitutes
practice
before
the
patent
office.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
now
third,
there
are
--
there
is
oral
argument
on
motions
in
the
patent
office
and
interference
cases.
and
fourth,
there's
a
whole
section
in
the
patent
rules
which
bears
a
big
heading
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
trial
in
interference
proceedings.
and
then
there
is
oral
argument
before
the
board
of
patent
interferences,
another
board
within
the
patent
office.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
yes,
sir.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
and
hold
himself
out
as
a
patent
lawyer.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
i
think
he
can
have
an
office
there.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
he
cannot
practice
law
in
florida,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
he
--
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
he
cannot
prepare
a
patent
application.
that
--
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
justice
goldberg,
most
--
the
great
bulk
of
patent
app
--
of
patent
agents
do
not
hold
themselves
out
to
the
public.
the
instance
of
a
patent
agent
holding
himself
out
to
the
public
as
entitled
to
practice
patent
law
is
a
rare
occurrence.
the
great
bulk
of
patent
agents
work
in
corporations,
in
the
government,
or
in
law
firms
largely
under
the
supervision
of
a
lawyer,
that
is
the
--
those
are
the
facts
which
distinguished
this
case
from
the
great
bulk
of
the
other
cases
involving
patent
agents.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
he
cannot
hold
himself
out
to
practice
law
in
the
patent
field.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
the
court
below
held
that
the
preparation
of
patent
applications
constitutes
the
practice
of
law.
he
would
be
enjoined
from
doing
that
and
he
will
be
barred
from
doing
it.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
yes,
sir,
if
he
is
practicing
law,
that
is
correct.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
i
think
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
working
under
the
supervision
of
a
lawyer,
yes
sir.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
well,
and
--
very
frankly,
lawyers
in
general
practice
don't
practice
patent
law
unless
they
are
also
admitted
to
practice
before
the
patent
office.
there
are,
however,
patent
law
firms
in
florida
and
i
dare
say
as
elsewhere
some
of
them
employ
patent
agents
to
work
in
the
firm
of
lawyers.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
or
with
a
corporation
or
within
the
government,
there
are
a
number
of
faculties
in
the
government.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
under
the
law
of
florida?
yes,
sir.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
with
one
condition,
mr.
justice
white,
and
that
is
that
the
lawyer
also
be
admitted
to
practice
before
the
patent
office.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
because
the
rules
of
the
--
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
no,
sir,
there's
a
federal
statute
which
requires
--
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
perhaps
so.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
i
think
so.
that's
right.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
yes,
sir.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
we
don't
believe
--
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
that
is
fairly
close
sir.
we
do
not
believe
a
patent
agent
has
the
right
to
practice
law
in
florida
in
the
patent
field.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
i
think
so.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
i
think
so.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
well
sir,
i
would
like
now
if
i
may
to
return
to
my
point
that
practice
before
the
patent
office
was
not
enjoined
by
the
court
below.
it
has
pointed
out
the
court
below
expressly
disavowed
any
intention
to
interfere
with
the
practice
--
the
practice
before
the
patent
office.
and
fourth,
in
support
of
--
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
yes,
sir,
that
is
true.
and
in
the
context
of
facts
in
this
case,
i
think
it
is
impossible
to
practice
before
the
patent
office
in
florida-d.c.
and
i
would
like
to
give
you
one
big
reason
in
my
opinion
why.
practice
before
the
patent
office
according
to
the
cases
as
i
understand
it
means
practice
in
the
presence
of
the
practice
office,
the
patent
office.
i
have
cited
some
five
cases
in
my
brief,
pages
54
and
55,
to
the
effect
that
practice
before
a
government
official
or
tribunal
means
in
the
presence
of
the
particular
government
official
or
tribunal.
those
five
cases
in
turn
i
may
say,
cites
some
other
cases
and
they
are
not
disputed
by
--
by
adversary
here.
and
further,
if
i
may
proceed
to
the
mechanics
of
practice
before
the
patent
office
which
i
think
there
are
some
significance
on
this
question,
we
find
that,
i
submit,
the
practice
before
the
patent
office
cannot
begin
until,
number
one,
a
proceeding
is
started
before
the
patent
office,
and
number
two,
there
is
an
applicant
there
who
can
be
represented.
now,
the
mere
preparation
of
a
patent
application
does
not
start
a
proceeding
in
the
patent
office.
secondly,
if
it's
mailed
at
the
patent
office
and
physically
received
by
the
patent
office,
it
is
not
automatically
filed
there.
there
is
a
rule
of
the
patent
office
which
says,
they
will
be
carefully
inspected,
and
if
the
particular
application
does
not
meet
the
specific
requirements
of
the
rules,
the
application
will
not
be
accepted,
and
will
be
sent
back
to
the
applicant.
and
i
may
that
if
the
statute
of
limitation
runs
in
the
meantime
of
course,
the
inventor
is
in
trouble.
now
finally,
there
is
no
applicant
before
the
patent
office
to
be
represented
by
anybody
until
after
an
application
has
been
physically
received
and
legally
accepted
and
filed
by
the
patent
office.
and
now
i
come
to
my
first
point,
which
is
if
the
states
have
the
right
to
control
and
regulate
the
practice
of
law.
this
i
think
has
been
settled
in
this
court
by
bradwell
versus
illinois
and
in
theard
versus
united
states
in
354
u.s.
this
court
stated
that
a
states
control
over
its
judicial
system
was
“autonomous”
and
the
reason
for
this
appears
to
be
as
stated
in
theard
versus
united
states
that
the
court's
control
over
a
lawyer's
professional
life
derived
from
his
relationship
to
the
responsibilities
of
the
court,
now
i
come
to
my
second
sub-point
under
this,
which
is
the
fact
that
the
practice
of
law
in
a
particular
state
involves
federal
subject
matter
in
no
way
diminishes
the
power
of
the
state
to
regulate
it
and
here
we
come,
if
the
court
please,
to
perhaps
the
only
unauthorized
practice
of
law
case
that
has
ever
actually
reach
this
court
and
then
cited
by
it
with
approval
and
that
case
is
kovrak
versus
ginsburg
in
358
u.s.
now
in
that
case,
kovrak
was
admitted
to
practice
before
this
court,
the
district
of
columbia
courts
and
most
significantly,
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania,
a
tribunal
which
sets
in
philadelphia.
now,
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
pennsylvania
bar,
but
like
the
petitioner
here
very
much,
he
nevertheless
set
up
an
office
in
philadelphia
and
preceded
as
such
--
advertised
himself
as
“attorney
at
law,
proctor
in
federal
taxation”.
and
at
this
point,
the
unauthorized
practice
committee
of
the
philadelphia
bar
association
proceeded
to
sue
to
enjoin
him
from
unlawfully
practicing
law
in
pennsylvania.
an
interestingly
enough
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
kovrak's
position
according
to
the
court's
statement
was
and
i'm
quoting
now,
“that
he
has
a
legal
right
to
practice
law
anywhere
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
with
regard
to
any
legal
matter
in
which
a
federal
question
was
involved,
no
matter
how
remote.”
this
is
on
page
26
and
28
of
respondent's
brief.
and
i
may
say
this
is
very
close
to
the
petitioner's
contention
in
this
case,
“that
he
has
a
right
to
practice
law
anywhere
in
florida
with
regard
to
any
legal
matter
in
which
a
patent
question
is
involved
perhaps”.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
yes,
bear
in
mind
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
is
entirely
right
sir,
but
here,
this
man,
held
--
opened
an
office
in
philadelphia,
the
very
place
where
this
tribunal
six
in
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
through
which
he
was
admitted,
and
he
held
himself
out
as
an
attorney
at
law,
proctor
in
federal
taxation.
and
he
contended
he
had
a
right
to
practice
law
anywhere
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
where
a
federal
question
was
involved.
and
the
court
rejected
his
contention
and
said
and
i
--
this
is
very
significant
if
you
will
bear
with
me,
i'd
like
to
read
it
just
one
sentence.
no
case
has
been
suggested
to
us
which
holds
that
membership
in
the
bar
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
entitles
an
attorney
to
practice
anywhere
in
the
united
states
without
reference
to
local
state
requirements.
and
that
we
substitute
membership
in
the
bar
of
the
united
states
patent
office.
we
have,
i
think
the
basic
problem
in
this
case.
now
in
addition,
in
kovrak
versus
ginsburg,
the
court,
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
also
pointed
out
that
this
did
not
interfere
with
his
right
to
try
cases
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
just
as
the
court
below
pointed
out
that
the
--
that
the
decree
below
does
not
prevent
him
from
practicing
before
the
patent
office
in
washington
d.c.
and
finally,
with
respect
to
this
case,
if
i
may
mention,
it
was
cited
with
approval
by
this
court
in
martin
versus
walton
in
368
u.s.
25.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
yes,
sir.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
appear
where,
sir?
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
exactly.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
not
so
much
a
part
of
--
the
matter
of
housing,
it's
a
matter
of
holding
himself
out.
he
can
house
himself
physically
anywhere
but
if
he
holds
himself
out
to
practice
law,
that
is
bad.
well,
i
may
say
in
this
connection,
there
are
two
leading
cases,
i
have
so
little
time
that
i'm
just
struggling
to
get
this
out
which
upheld
that
admission
to
practice
before
a
federal
administrative
agency
does
not
entitle
the
person
involved
to
practice
law
in
a
particular
state.
now
one
of
them
is
a
leading
case
in
the
patent
field,
chicago
bar
versus
kellogg
upon
which
the
court
below
extensively
relied.
and
again,
the
petitioner
in
that
case
contended
there
as
he
does
here,
that
his
recognition
before
the
patent
office
entitled
him
to
practice
patent
law
in
illinois.
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
said,
“no,
you
can
practice
before
the
patent
office
to
beat
the
bond
but
you
cannot
practice
patent
law
in
illinois.”
now
if
i
may
continue,
i
only
have
four
minutes
left
that
i
want
to
get
to
this
matter
of
the
construction
of
the
statute,
if
the
court
please,
because
this
is
rather
important.
the
petitioner
is
given
the
impression
that
there
is
some
kind
of
federal
preemption
here.
in
my
opinion,
this
is
not
so.
the
keyword
in
this
statute
is
the
word
recognition.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
the
word
recognition
does
not
deal
with
the
subject
or
purport
to
grant
anything
of
a
nature
of
a
federal
license,
rather
it
is
a
much
more
passive
lukewarm
tepid
kind
of
word
which
deals
only,
as
i
read
webster's
dictionary
with
the
subject
of
acceptance
in
the
sense
of
being
entitled
to
attention.
this
is
a
far
cry
from
an
affirmative
grant
of
a
license
or
the
language
in
the
federal
power
act
for
instance
which
specifically
says
that
so
on
as
the
commission
has
power
to
issue
licenses
for
the
construction
of
dams,
etcetera.
now
finally
and
this
would
be
the
last
point
i
was
trying
to
get
out
because
i
do
not
have
any
more
time.
this
particular
statute
in
dealing
with
the
recognition,
i
submit,
was
not
passed
to
implement
article
1,
section
8,
clause
8
of
the
constitution,
rather
it
was
merely
a
legislative
recognition
of
a
practice
which
had
long
existed
in
many
of
the
government
departments
as
part
of
their
inherent
power
as
a
government
department
under
article
2
of
the
constitution.
now,
the
first
place
under
that,
during
the
civil
war
and
shortly
thereafter,
the
pension
office
dealt
with
the
subject
of
admission
of
attorneys
to
practice
and
their
continued
regu
--
recognition
under
regulations
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
then
the
attorney
general
in
1880
ruled
that
the
authority
to
disbar
an
attorney
practicing
before
the
department
of
the
interior
was
an
authority
not
given
by
statute
but
which
seems
to
have
been
exercised
heretofore
by
heads
of
departments
in
the
protection
of
the
government.
that
is
independent
of
statute
and
that
is
this
statute
here
because
it
is
a
companion
statute,
the
two
statutes
which
were
passed
at
1884,
each
virtually
identical
with
this
one,
one
dealing
with
interior
and
one
dealing
with
treasury.
and
finally,
in
philips
versus
ballinger,
a
case
which
is
cited
by
approval
by
this
court
in
goldsmith
versus
board
of
tax
appeals,
the
court
there
upheld
the
disbarment
of
a
lawyer
by
the
secretary
of
interior
under
the
1884
act,
which
as
i
say
is
virtually
identical
with
this
one
on
the
theory
and
i'm
quoting
the
case
now,
“it
is
unnecessary
to
consider
whether
the
1884
act
constitutes
anything
more
than
a
legislative
sanction
of
the
practice
heretofore
existing
under
another
statute
by
a
--
through
all
revised
statute
161
nullified
united
states
code
22.
and
that
statute,
i
may
say,
gives
the
head
of
each
department
the
power
to
promulgate
rules
governing
the
conduct
of
this
department
and
this
court
held
in
united
states
versus
george
in
228
united
states
that
the
power
given
by
that
statute
was
administrative
only
and
not
legislative.
in
short,
my
point
here
is,
if
the
court
please,
that
this
particular
statute
was
not
passed
to
implement
article
1,
section
8,
clause
8,
but
rather
was
a
mere
legislative
recognition
of
a
practice
theretofore
existing
for
many
years
as
part
of
the
inherent
power
of
a
government
department
under
article
2
of
the
constitution.
now
there's
another
feature
the
red
light
hasn't
flashed
yet
but
there
is
another
feature
here
which
i
wish
to
--
which
is
of
some
importance.
and
that
is
to
take
the
administrative
interpretation.
in
1938,
the
rules
of
the
patent
office
were
revised
so
as
to
provide
categorically,
and
i
have
this
in
full
page
type
on
page
56
of
our
brief,
that
the
registration
on
the
patent
office
“shall
not
be
construed
as
authorizing
persons
not
members
of
the
bar
to
practice
law.”
and
that
in
1949,
the
rules
were
given
--
addressed
the
provision
and
that
provision
was
restated
in
a
new
rule
to
effect
that
registration
in
the
patent
office
shall
only
entitle
the
persons
registered
to
practice
before
the
patent
office;
in
short,
not
somewhere
else.
now,
i
have
--
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
yes,
sir.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
in
my
opinion,
that
is
correct.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
no,
sir,
there
is
an
additional
rule
which
says
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
trademark.
mr.
f.
trowbridge
vom
baur
yes,
sir.
if
you
will
look
on
page
56
of
respondent's
brief,
you
will
see
the
1938
rule
which
provides
in
categorical
terms
the
registration
before
the
patent
office
shall
not
be
construed
as
authorizing
persons
not
members
of
the
bar
to
practice
law.
now
there
is
a
separate
--
an
additional
rule
which
is
mentioned
i
think
in
appendix
a
which
has
said
the
same
thing
for
trademark
practices.
then
as
i've
pointed
out,
the
1938
rules
when
they
were
given
a
general
revision
in
1949,
preceded
the
state,
i
submit
the
same
thing
by
providing
that
registration
in
the
patent
office
shall
only
entitle
people
to
practice
before
the
patent
office.
now
there's
one
other
point
i
should
like
to
try
to
get
up
before
the
red
light
flashes,
and
that
is
that
the
patent
power
is
a
very
limited
power.
this
court
has
held
in
patterson
versus
kentucky
and
two
other
cases
that
except
for
interference
with
an
--
and
fetters
exclusive
right
to
a
patented
invention,
the
patent
clause
and
the
patent
statute
passed
by
congress
are
subject
to
the
state's
police
power
and
there
is
at
least
one
unauthorized
practice
case
which
is
referred
to
at
some
length
in
patterson
versus
kentucky,
one
of
the
leading
cases
in
this
court
on
federal
state
relations
in
the
--
rather
in
the
patent
field
where
the
--
where
jordan,
this
is
jordan
versus
overseers
of
dayton
in
our
brief
at
pages
71
to
73
claimed
that
he
had
a
federal
right
to
administer
a
patented
product
without
getting
a
license
to
practice
medicine
in
ohio.
and
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
and
also
this
court
said
that
he
have
to
get
a
license
to
practice
medicine
in
ohio
before
he
could
administer
the
particular
invention.
of
that,
the
case
at
least
came
close
to
interfering
with
an
inventor's
exclusive
right
to
an
invention.
well,
our
case
does
not.
our
case
bears
no
relationship
whatever
to
the
protection
of
an
inventor's
exclusive
right
to
an
invention.
finally,
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
involves
the
future
of
the
bar
and
my
last
point
is
that
a
strong
bar
is
itself
essential
to
the
public
welfare,
and
in
this
connection,
i
think
it
is
effect
of
no
small
significance
that
one
of
the
first
acts
of
dictators
such
as
hitler,
mussolini
and
castro
is
to
decimate
the
bar
and
with
the
decimation
of
the
bar
there
disappears
also
that
leadership
and
public
affairs,
if
i
may
say
so,
and
the
protection
of
the
public
which
a
strong
bar
affords.
and
with
--
if
the
practice
of
law
is
going
to
be
whittled
away,
chip
by
chip
and
turned
over
to
laymen,
lay
agencies
then
the
public
will
no
longer
have
the
protection
which
a
strong
bar
affords
and
the
public
will
suffer.
