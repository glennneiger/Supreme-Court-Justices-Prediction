justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
stating
precisely
as
you
can
--
precisely
what
you
think
an
agent
can
do
like
this
sort
of
the
staging
in
the
practice
of
law
in
giving
legal
opinions
and
so
forth,
precisely
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
of
course,
that
if
he
can
do
that
as
an
agent,
he
can
do
it
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
he
can
do
it
in
any
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
most
of
the
agents
is
here
in
washington
provide
for
practice
and
their
agencies
of
people
who
are
not
attorneys.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
are
other
agencies
in
the
city
of
washington
besides
the
patent
office
and
many
of
them,
people
who
are
there
all
the
time
and
file
applications
of
various
kinds
and
types.
lawyers
do
it
sometimes
and
other
people
do
it
sometimes.
are
there
any
regulations
with
reference
to
the
other
agencies
that
you
know
of
in
this
connection
besides
the
patent
office?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
that
familiar
with
the
--
that
branch,
however,
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
treasury
department
can
qualify
or
register
qualified
attorneys
and
laymen
to
represent
people
before
the
customs
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
jurisdiction
of
dispute
something
like
a
dispute
that
they
frequently
have
over
--
making
abstracts
of
title?
i've
been
familiar
with
some
of
those.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
wouldn't
have
(voice
overlap)
to
this
title,
lawyers
sometimes
get
an
idea
that
nobody
should
make
abstract
for
a
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
they
have
laws
to
that
effect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
also
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
also
analogous,
i
assume,
to
the
controversy
that
come
over
banks.
justice
hugo
l.
black
acting
as
guardians
and
so
forth,
and
to
what
extent
they
can
do
one
thing
and
not
do
another.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
aren't
we
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
that
either.
what
i
understand
is,
as
you
claim
that
the
federal
government
with
power
to
do
so
as
prescribed
how
patent
applications
shall
be
filed
carried
to
the
patent
office
and
that
the
appointed
agents
who
have
power
to
do
that,
do
you
say
that
florida
has
come
along
and
said
that
--
the
doing
of
that
thing
violates
florida
law
and
you
say
that
it's
barred
by
the
superior
--
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
that's
your
only
question,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
claim
as
i
understand
it
that
the
florida
court
did
that
it
can
prevent
that
being
done
in
florida
whatever
else
might
be
done
somewhere
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
they
can't
prevent
it
being
done
there
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
in
california
because
they
were
without
power.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
they
don't
have
a
right
to
have
clothes
shop
industry?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
something
like
the
labor
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
something
like
a
labor
act
preemption.
justice
hugo
l.
black
very
well.
mr.
vom
baur.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
they
specifically
said
that,
is
it
not,
on
page
68?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
if
he
comes
to
washington
and
does
these
things,
couldn't
it?
but
if
it's
practiced
before
the
patent
office
to
do
these
things
in
florida,
certainly,
he's
been
enjoined
to
that
extent
from
practicing
before
the
patent
office.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
--
i
think
i
understand
what
the
idea
is
but
i'd
like
to
just
state.do
you
represent
the
bar
association,
do
you
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
american
bar
association.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
--
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
under
the
position
of
bar
association
means
that
it
doesn't
want
any
patent
agents
doing
the
business
in
florida,
thinks
they
shouldn't
do
it,
that's
its
position
and
belief
and
if
they
should
--
cannot
be
done
legally
and
if
the
state
of
florida
can
bar
agents
from
carrying
on
any
of
that
patent
activities
in
florida.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
gather
it
to
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
let's
forget
the
words
practice
law.
that
means
a
thousand
different
things
to
a
thousand
different
people.
what
can
he
do
--
or
is
it
your
position
that
he
cannot
thoroughly
be
there,
be
a
patent
agent,
draw
up
application,
talk
to
people
about
their
applications,
amend
their
applications
and
general
management,
and
do
any
of
those
things
and
that
if
he
does,
he
violates
the
law
of
florida
under
the
law
of
florida
is
valid.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
we
could
get
it
better
if
it's
--
just
argued
on
those
--
that
statement
of
facts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
when
done
outside
the
state
of
florida,
that's
the
language
you've
used.
