mr.
chief
justice,
this

no,
sir,
it
is
not
true
because
in
the
first
place,
if
i
may
say
so,
sir,
it
is
unrealistic
in
the
sense
that
no
general
practitioner
tries
to
file
applications
in
the
patent
office.
there
is
a
federal
statute
which
prohibits
him
from
holding
himself
as
qualified
to
do
that
unless
he
has
admitted
also
to
practice
before
the
patent
office.
the
great
bulk
of
the
patent
work
in
this
country,
as
i
understand
it,
is
done
by
lawyers
who
were
admitted
to
practice
before
the
patent
office
and
those
are
what
you
might
call
dual
authority.
