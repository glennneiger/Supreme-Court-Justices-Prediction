mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
petitioner
who
is
a
nonlawyer
has
been
duly
authorized
by
the
commissioner
of
patents
pursuant
to
federal
statutes
and
rules
to
advise
and
represent
applicants
before
the
patent
office
in
the
preparation
and
prosecution
of
patent
applications.
the
petitioner
resides
in
florida
and
there
carries
on
these
activities.
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
the
state
of
florida
has
the
power
to
enjoin
petitioner
from
these
activities
merely
because
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
florida
bar,
and
the
court
has
forbidden
such
activities,
and
we
feel
that
the
court
was
incorrect
in
the
following
specific
portions
of
the
injunction,
wherein
the
--
enjoined
the
petitioner
from
rendering
opinions
as
to
patentability
of
inventions,
from
holding
himself
out
in
florida
as
qualified
to
prepare
and
prosecute
applications
for
letters
patents,
and
amendments
thereto,
and
from
actually
preparing
in
prosecution
applications
--
prosecuting
applications
for
letters
patents,
and
amendments
thereto
in
florida.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
he
can
theoretically
call
himself
a
patent
attorney
because
he
was
admitted
to
practice
before
the
patent
office
prior
to
1938
at
which
time
even
though
he
was
a
nonlawyer,
he
was
entitled
to
call
himself
a
patent
attorney.
in
1938,
the
rules
were
changed
so
that
nonlawyers
thereafter
registered
with
the
patent
office
couldn't
but
there
is
a
grandfather
clause
which
permitted
those
admitted
before
to
still
continue
calling
the
same
thing.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
he
can't
call
himself
a
patent
lawyer.
a
patent
lawyer
would
be
a
term
which
he
is
not
permitted
to
use.
he
is
not
a
lawyer.
now
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
he
can
describe
himself
as
a
patent
agent
or
as
--
as
a
patent
attorney.
in
this
case,
actually
he
has
ceased
to
use
the
name
patent
attorney,
although
under
the
federal
rules,
he
is
permitted
to
do
so.
this
perhaps
might
be
one
of
the
engraftments
on
federal
rules
which
might
be
permissible
so
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
mistake
as
to
what
capacity
he's
operating
under.
now,
he
has
voluntarily
stopped
using
the
term
patent
attorney.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
issue
is
not
before
us.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
my
understanding
is
that
originally
attorney
meant
attorney
in
fact,
and
then
as
distinguished
from
attorney
at
law
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
and
that
i
think
that
the
normal
interpretation
of
the
word
today,
an
attorney
means
an
attorney
at
law.
i
think
that's
the
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
that
would
be
giving
me
an
attorney
--
power
of
attorney
in
fact.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
and
i
think
that
usually
they
qualify
it
to
be
an
attorney
of
fact
rather
than
a
straight
attorney
which
i
think
to
the
general
public
which
he's
really
most
interested
in
what
they
are
called.
to
general
public,
i
think
that
a
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
--
person
who
says
an
attorney
means
he's
an
attorney
of
law.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
i
think
that
is
correct
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
--
what
the
public
necessarily
think.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
the
record
doesn't
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
the
record
does
not
show
that
and
i
myself
do
not
know.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
there
are
two
classifications,
'patent
attorneys'
and
patent
agents.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
the
members
who
are
registered
with
the
commissioner
of
patents
who
are
attorneys
are
entered
on
the
list
of
'patent
attorneys'.
now
those
who
are
not
are
entered
on
a
list
called
patent
agents.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
correct.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
we
object
your
honor
to
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
we
don't
object
to
that.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
we
object
to
the
portion
wherein
it
says
including
opinions
as
to
patentability.
we
maintain
that
this
is
a
necessary
function
in
advising
an
inventor
as
to
the
preparation
of
an
application.
we
object
to
number
four
and
number
five
as
well.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
three
is
--
as
broadly
stated
preparing
drafting
and
construing
legal
documents,
he
is
not
a
lawyer.
if
this,
however,
was
intended
to
include
activities
before
the
patent
office,
then
we
would
object
to
it.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
of
course
that
is
particularly
covered
in
five.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
and
insofar
as
any
activities
which
are
restricted
to
state
lawyers,
we
don't
feel
that
he
has
any
right
to
pursue
those.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
your
honor,
three
as
stated
strictly
the
practice
of
law
which
would
we
--
within
the
purview
of
the
state.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
it
does.
it
--
you
have
to
find
out
what
documents
were
intended,
however,
what
we
are
particularly
concerned
with
are
four
and
five
having
to
do
with
the
patent
applications.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
there
is
an
answer
--
our
question
would
have
to
be
answered
yes
in
the
sense
that
the
patent
application
as
it
has
been
held
by
this
court
is
really
a
contract
between
the
inventor
and
the
government.
now
this
is
a
contract,
however,
that
can
be
prepared
for
the
inventor
only
by
those
whom
the
commissioner
of
patents
has
decided,
has
sufficiently
qualified
both
legally
and
technically
to
prepare
and
prosecute
such
a
contract.
it
is
a
contract
which
cannot
be
prepared
on
behalf
of
an
inventor
by
any
regular
member
of
a
state
bar.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
that
would
not
be
practiced
before
the
patent
office.
yes,
that
would
be
a
legal
document.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
but
we
aren't
contending
that
practice
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
i
would
say
that
there
is
no
right
in
a
patent
agent
to
appeal
to
a
court
without
becoming
a
member
of
the
bar
of
that
court.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
court
of
--
customs
and
patent
appeals,
correct.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
now,
we
contend
that
practice
before
the
patent
office
consist
of
preparing
a
patent
application
after
consulting
with
the
inventor
as
to
the
scope
of
the
invention
then
filing
that
patent
application
with
the
patent
office,
and
then
prosecuting
it
through
the
patent
office
until
there
is
a
final
determination
by
the
patent
office,
all
of
these
to
be
performed
within
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
patent
office.
now,
once
a
patent
is
issued
then
any
advice
pertaining
to
the
patent
would
not
be
practiced
before
the
patent
office.
preparing
of
license
agreements
under
patents
is
not
something
which
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
patent
office.
that
would
not
be
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
i
would
say
that
matters
relating
to
infringement
are
matters
of
law
relating
to
issued
patents
over
which
the
patent
office
has
no
jurisdiction.
so
therefore,
it
would
not
be
practiced
before
the
patent
office.
that
would
be
reserved
to
a
lawyer.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
by
the
rules
of
the
patent
office,
agents
and
attorneys
were
treated
alike
within
the
conduct
of
interference
proceedings.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
the
advise
as
to
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
that's
--
that
would
be
another
problem.
first
of
all,
if
an
inventor
comes
to
a
patent
practitioner
being
an
attorney
or
agent,
his
first
problem
is,
is
this
an
invention
which
calls
for
making
a
preliminary
search
back
here
in
washington
in
the
patent
office.
after
the
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
is
correct.
that
is
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
he
is
rendering
opinions
as
to
whether
the
particular
invention
concerned
is
new
and
inventive
in
relation
to
the
disclosures
of
those
other
patents.
now
the
patents
are
prior
--
part
of
the
prior
art
which
can
invalidate
the
patent,
but
so
are
magazine
articles,
publications
which
aren't
legal
documents.
as
far
as
determining
patentability
as
to
whether
the
following
application,
all
that
you
are
concerned
with
is
whether
the
particular
invention
now
is
different
from
what
has
been
done
in
the
past.
you
aren't
concerned
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
it's
very
conceivable
that
he
might.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
i
think
that
when
you
get
to
matters
like
that,
that
that
is
beyond
the
rights
of
a
patent
agent
but
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
you
would
have
to
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
i
would
say
so.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
an
interference
proceeding
is
a
proceeding
within
the
patent
office
to
determine
which
of
two
applicants
is
actually
the
first
inventor.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
it's
initiated
by
--
usually
by
the
patent
office
because
there
are
two
conflicting
applications
in
the
patent
office
which
are
claiming
the
same
subject
matter.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
it
could
be
initiated
by
the
fact
of
a
patent
issuing
which
was
then
is
a
public
document.
someone
else
who
has
the
same
invention
either
already
on
--
in
an
application
in
the
patent
office
are
--
who
then
files
an
application
claiming
the
same
subject
matter
in
order
to
setup
an
interference.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
it
involves
--
well,
pleadings
of
a
sort,
yes,
within
the
patent
office.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
it
concerns
the
taking
of
testimony
by
deposition.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
by
deposition.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
the
rules
granting
that
privilege.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
the
rules
throughout
the
--
the
rules
of
practice
throughout
refer
to
attorney
or
agent
in
all
instances
that
i
can
find
wherein
it
determines
what
--
what
can
be
done.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
as
i
was
trying
to
find
a
particular
place
here
as
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
the
bulk
of
the
proceedings
are
by
mail,
all
conducts
with
the
patent
office
is
by
writing
otherwise
depositions
are
reduced
to
writing.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
under
the
rules,
he
is,
yes.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
i
know
of
no
such
statistics
along
that
line,
all
i
know
are
the
statistics
which
we
obtained
from
the
patent
office
as
to
the
numbers
of
practitioners
in
the
various
groups.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
precisely,
i
think
that
the
patent
agent
can
advise
and
assist
inventors
in
the
preparation
and
prosecution
of
applications
before
the
patent
office.
and
this,
i
believe
includes
by
necessity,
the
right
to
advise
a
client
as
to
whether
a
patent
application
should
be
filed,
that
is
whether
it's
patentable.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
your
honor
because
'patent
attorneys'
and
agents
reside
all
over
the
country
as
to
inventors.
it's
necessary
for
them
--
for
the
practitioner
to
meet
with
the
inventor
to
discuss
the
technical
problems
involved
in
any
invention.
now
the
congress
has,
i'm
sure
recognized
the
fact
that
there
are
patent
agents
and
practitioners
all
throughout
the
country.
the
patent
office,
i
believe,
certainly
realizes
--
publishes
a
list
of
practitioners
by
state.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
they
do.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
and
from
the
amicus
brief,
i
understand
that
about
a
third
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
practitioners
are
not
attorneys.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well
there
again,
the
treasury
before
the
tax
court
has
provisions
wherein
it
can
set
the
standards
of
who
appears
before
the
agency
and
it
permits
attorneys
are
qualified
nonattorneys
to
represent
people
before
that
agency.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
i'm
--
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
problems
involving
the
object
of
titles.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
oh,
i
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
yes,
and
actually
you
would
have
really
somewhat
the
same
problem
here
that
that's
a
matter
of
policing
of
activities
which
are
carried
on
by
professions
which
sometime
overstep
their
rights
and
privileges
and
get
into
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law.
that
of
course,
is
improper.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
could
happen
here.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that's
correct
and
even
though
there
maybe
problems,
there's
no
reason
to
abolish
those
institutions.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
i
can
take
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
i
contend
that
this
is
an
area
under
which
florida
has
no
power
that
this
is
not
an
area
under
which
any
of
their
general
attorneys
can
practice.
this
is
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
i
think
it
might
have
that
power
but
i
don't
think
that
it
can
then
go
and
say
that
even
though
they
consider
this
to
be
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law,
i
don't
think
that
they
have
the
right,
the
power
to
say
that
a
person
cannot
do
that
in
florida
when
he
has
a
federally
right
to
do
it.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
that
is
correct.
and
the
patent
statutes
and
rules
do
provide
that.
the
patent
statutes
provide
--
give
the
commissioner
of
patents
the
sole
power
to
determine
who
is
to
be
admitted
to
practice
before
the
patent
office.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
is
correct.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
not
when
it
discuss
upon
federal
rights
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
i
don't
think
that
you
are
bound
by
their
determination
that
this
is
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law
and
therefore
must
be
stopped.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes.
that
there
is
a
case
cited
in
the
--
in
the
reply
brief
also
relied
upon
by
respondent
wherein
they
say
that
the
state
of
florida's
determination
on
this
matter
should
be
accepted
as
final
and
binding
on
this
court.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
is
correct.
and
i
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
i
think
it's
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
i
think
it's
completely
at
odds
with
the
federal
legislation
on
the
subject.
if
all
states
were
to
do
this
and
as
indicated
by
one
of
these
amicus
briefs,
their
bar
associations
of
about
20
different
states
taking
the
respondent's
position.
obviously,
they
are
all
going
to
--
to
do
the
same
thing
if
the
florida
decision
is
upheld
and
the
position
of
patent
agents
sanctioned
by
congress
would
be
eliminated.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
i
don't,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
they
do,
that
this
is
something
i
feel
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
state.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
only
re
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
only
relating
to
practice
within
the
patent
office.
what
field
in
which
they
have
been
especially
qualified
to
which
they
have
had
to
take
a
test,
a
one
day
written
test
given
to
lawyers
and
agents
alike
before
the
patent
office
to
meet
the
technical
requirements
of
the
--
an
equivalent
of
an
engineering
degree
which
--
which
is
something
that
the
average
attorney
does
not
posses.
these
are
matters
of
special
techniques
both
legal
and
technical
which
are
required
to
compare
these
patent
applications.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
your
honor,
because
then
with
four,
it
says
he
can't
hold
himself
out
as
qualified
to
prepare
and
prosecute
applications,
what
sense
would
there
be
in
saying
that
he
could
do
that
in
florida
and
yet
say
that
he
couldn't
hold
himself
out
as
--
and
able
to
do
that.
it
makes
no
sense
to
me.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
is
our
position.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
because
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
because
the
--
the
judgment
here
extends
far
beyond
practice
before
the
patent
office.
now,
we
are
con
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
then
we
would
say
that
was
bad.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
we
do,
your
honor,
and
that's
why
i
was
talking
about
specifically
four
and
five.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well
then,
of
course
that's
what
they
do
right
now.
that
might
however
be
in
such
a
field
that
a
state
could
properly
require
those
persons
to
designate
themselves
in
such
a
manner
that
would
not
confuse
the
public
into
thinking
that
they
were
actually
attorneys
at
law.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
that's
--
of
course,
that
is
one
of
the
problems
involved
here.
that's
why
the
case
is
here.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
is
correct
generally.
but
there's
another
requirement.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
on
that's
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
on
that
specific
point,
this
court
itself
has
said
that
it's
the
duty
of
the
commissioner,
not
the
courts
to
protect
the
public
from
dishonest
patent
practitioners.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
we
find
it
in
sections
31,
32,
and
33
of
title
35
and
then
in
the
--
in
a
comprehensive
set
of
rules
which
have
been
adopted
by
the
patent
office
covering
the
admission,
conduct,
and
expulsion-exclusion
and
discipline
of
patent
practitioners.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
in
this
particularity,
yes.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
like
what?
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
i
know.
