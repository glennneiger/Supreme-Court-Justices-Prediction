justice

stewart
or
whether
an
attorney
means
agent,
doesn't
it,
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
lawyer
although
a
good
many
people
think.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
if
i
give
you
a
power
of
attorney
because
you're
my
attorney,
you're
not
necessarily
a
lawyer
although
you
have
to
be
one.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
an
attorney
has
come
to
mean
a
lawyer.
justice
potter
stewart
although
the
dictionary
definition
i'm
sure
without
having
looked
it
up
which
showed
at
least
one
meaning
of
the
word,
it's
simply
“agent.”
justice

stewart
qualification.
justice
potter
stewart
in
short,
is
it
correct
to
say
that
the
issues
now
are
narrowed
so
that
all
the
petitioner
is
claiming
is
what
the
--
what
the
rules
of
the
patent
office
gives
him,
by
which
do
not
include
the
right
to
hold
yourself
out
as
a
lawyer
in
the
general
practice
of
law.
justice
potter
stewart
so
now
that
--
it's
boiled
down
to
all
--
he
is
claiming
against
infringement
by
florida
of
the
rights,
you
say,
which
the
patent
office
gives
him,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
any?
