justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
all
--
aren't
all
the
proceedings
by
mail
with
the
patent
office.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
anything
--
any
kind
of
proceedings
that
goes
on
in
the
patent
office
an
agent
who
is
authorized
to
inform
the
patent
office
as
well
as
an
attorney.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
say,
don't
you
that
if
number
six
says
otherwise
engaging
in
the
practice
of
law,
i
would
assume
you
would
say
that
if
doing
what
the
pat
--
patent
office
tells
you,
you
can
do,
happens
to
amount
to
the
practice
of
law
in
the
state
of
florida,
florida
nevertheless
cannot
prevent
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
patent
office
wants
to
call
an
attorney
instead
of
agents.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
vom
baur,
that
doesn't
quite
follow
does
it
really
--
it
seems
to
me
that
anything
that
the
patent
office
want
it
done
or
that
not
wanted
done,
permitted
to
be
done
by
a
nonlawyer,
he
could
do
it.
anything
that
required
a
lawyer
to
do
in
the
state
of
florida
any
lawyer
could
do
as
far
as
florida
law
is
--
were
concerned.
any
lawyer
could
give
a
patent
opinion,
any
lawyer,
isn't
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
isn't
it
true
that
any
lawyer
could
hire
this
man
to
help
him
and
sign
his
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
how
far
does
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
just
talking
about
the
laws
in
the
state
of
florida?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
this
but
anything
that
goes
to
the
patent
office,
he
signs.
now,
the
two
of
them
together
could
do
--
could
do
everything
that
you
or
the
state
of
florida
or
the
patent
office
which
implies.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
