justice
potter
stewart
particularly
for
me,
mr.
fitzgerald
with
that
argument
is
that
the
kahns
aren't
here.
they
are
not
the
petitioner's
here.
you
have
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
not
talking
about
the
kahns
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
petitioner
here
is
a
third
party
and
how
can
avail
himself
to
their
rights
or
complain
if
their
rights
are
violated
anymore
that
he
can
complain
if
they
hadn't
waived
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
testified
against
him?
justice
potter
stewart
well
testimony,
yeah.
their
testimony
against
this
defendant
would
have
prejudiced
him
too,
but
we
are
talking
about
whether
or
not
it
was
erroneous,
whether
it
was
an
error.
now,
of
course
in
the
prosecution
testimony
always
prejudiced
the
defendant.
