mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
justices
of
this
court.
may
it
please
the
court,
for
a
moment
i
would
just
like
to
review
the
factual
situation
concerned
with
this
case?
this
case
involves
an
infraction
of
title
26
of
the
u.s.
code,
which
requires
any
person
in
the
business
of
accepting
wagers
to
have
a
federal
tax
stamp,
further
to
register
as
a
so-called
acceptor
of
such
wagers
with
the
local
internal
revenue
bureau.
david
namet
was
accused
of
failing
to
have
done
this.
the
treasury
agents
for
sometime
conducted
a
surveillance
of
mr.
namet,
during
which
period
they
followed
him
about.
they
saw
him
visiting
on
a
couple
of
times
a
week
various
variety
stores,
which
had
a
reputation
for
accepting
wagers.
at
no
time
in
their
entire
surveillance,
which
consumed
over
a
month,
did
they
ever
see
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
here,
accept
one
bet,
one
wager
for
himself
or
anybody
else
or
did
they
find
any
--
during
that
period
of
surveillance,
any
kind
of
evidence
upon
his
person.
the
evidence
offered
by
the
government's
eyewitnesses
was
to
the
effect
that
the
surveillance
was
conducted
in
the
month
of
march
during
one
of
the
fabled
new
england
winters
of
course
where
an
automobile
could
be
used
and
when
it
couldn't,
the
petitioner
would
go
on
foot.
this
time
he
wore
a
three-quarter
length
coat,
which
paired
with
patch
pockets.
witnesses
testified
to
the
effect
that
as
he
went
into
the
different
stores,
his
pockets
were
perceptibly
filled
when
he
came
out
while
there
were
perceptibly
empty
when
he
went
in.
a
raid
was
eventually
conducted
in
the
city
of
chelsea,
massachusetts
to
the
north
of
boston,
at
which
time
the
treasury
agents
went
into
the
house
of
namet.
there
they
found
an
envelope
containing
--
three
envelopes
containing
a
total
of
$700,
$75
and
$50
and
$186
in
cash
on
defendant
namet's
peron.
they
found
miscellaneous
items
of
pieces
of
paper
with
numbers
on
them.
political
cards,
pencils,
paper,
unused
pads,
three
slips
in
his
wallet
the
size
of
3x5
pad
containing
some
numbers
there
on,
none
of
which
was
dated
in
anyway
except
for
three
items,
two
of
which
were
mere
information
items
called
half
slips;
they
were
dated
1948
and
1949
i
believe.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
a
half
slip
your
honor
is
a
card
where
the
better
puts
in
a
number
to
a
person
engaged
in
a
business
of
taking
wagers.
should
numbers
they
play
come
up
so
frequently,
they
are
only
paid
half
of
the
odds,
which
another
number
would
pay
the
full
extent
of
the
odds.
these
are
merely
for
information
purposes
and
i
suppose
they
found
as
has
been
testified
by
experts
in
these
various
cases
and
through
the
course
of
the
year
or
so
as
the
numbers
come
out
repeatedly
in
the
newspapers,
they
are
taken
from
newspapers
by
the
way,
should
numbers
repeat
themselves
with
such
a
frequency,
that
it's
unfair
to
the
so-called
man
who
accepts
a
wager
to
have
him
pay
the
full
amount
of
the
bet,
so
therefore
he
only
pays
half,
they
are
just
information.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
something
to
that
effect
your
honor.
but
these
are
not
for
sale,
they
are
given
away
and
there
was
some
other
--
and
there
was
one
other
envelope
in
the
defendant
namet's
house,
which
had
a
date
february
with
no
specific
day
your
honor
but
1949.
about
this
evidence
which
was
taken
in
his
house,
his
son
appeared
and
testified
on
behalf
of
his
father
and
parenthetically
and
coincidentally
his
son
happens
to
be
a
practicing
lawyer
in
massachusetts,
office
of
the
court.
he
testified
to
the
effect
of
this
material,
this
pile
of
pencils
and
papers
have
been
around
the
house
for
years
to
his
knowledge.
the
money
and
the
envelopes
was
the
proceeds
of
an
insurance
policy
left
over
after
they
had
buried
his
mother
with
--
recently
before
this
so-called
raid.
at
the
trial,
it
was
during
the
same
raid
in
another
part
of
the
city,
same
agents
picked
up
a
husband
and
a
wife
irving
and
annette
kahn.
present
counsel
appeared
for
all
three.
for
reasons
best
known
to
counsel,
he
suggested
that
the
kahns
change
their
plea
of
guilty
to
not
guilty,
which
they
did.
while
changing
their
plea
to
guilty
and
at
the
same
time,
the
namet
trial
was
to
proceed
on
a
not
guilty
basis
for
a
jury.
the
united
states
attorney
had
the
united
states
marshall
present
serve
the
two
kahns
with
a
summons.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
separate
and
--
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
yes,
mr.
justice
they
were
similar,
but
separate.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
all
with
the
same
deed.
the
kahns,
husband
and
wife
were
on
separate
information,
both
included
on
that
information,
namet
was
included
on
other
information.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
same
judge.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
i
was
the
counselor,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
the
kahns
case
called
first
that
morning.
when
first
we
appeared
in
the
court
as
it
usually
happens,
the
call
of
the
list,
which
counsel
on
short
notice
generally
to
accept
the
practice
pleads
not
guilty.
then
the
case
is
marked
for
trial
and
the
day
came
for
trial,
all
three
were
called
at
the
same
time.
at
that
time,
the
counsel
decided
for
the
best
interests
of
the
kahns
to
plead
guilty.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
and
they
pleaded
guilty.
and
the
case
is
customarily
done
on
our
jurisdiction,
the
cases
were
put
off
for
usually
a
minimum
of
two
weeks
for
disposition.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
for
a
probationary
report
and
so
forth.
so,
at
that
particular
moment
upon
their
plea
of
guilty,
they
were
served
with
a
summons
to
be
government
witnesses.
while
it
isn't
a
matter
of
any
record
this
took
place
down
the
back
of
the
courtroom
during
a
recess.
counsel
advised
the
united
states
attorney
that
he
would
instruct
the
kahns
about
their
rights
to
further
incrimination
and
that
he
believed
that
they
would
avail
themselves
of
the
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
the
trial
then
started
the
case
of
namet
and
jury
was
impaneled
and
namet
--
the
government
made
their
opening.
of
course,
the
counsel
believed
that
he
had
to
wait
until
the
opening
was
made
to
be
sure
of
what
was
going
to
be
said.
in
the
opening,
the
government
attorney
stated
to
the
jury
that
he
would
produce
two
witnesses,
a
husband
and
wife
who
he
believed
would
testify
against
the
defendant
namet.
once
he
finished
his
opening,
counsel,
the
government
and
defense
counsel
approached
the
bench.
there
ensued
one
of
many
bench
conferences,
which
is
replayed
in
the
transcript
and
which
isn't
in
the
transcript
many,
many
lobby
conferences
ensued
beside
that,
over
a
period
of
two
days.
the
principle
issue
was
whether
the
government
could
use
the
kahns
as
witnesses,
which
raises
the
salient
issue
that
the
counsel
brings
before
this
court.
so,
whether
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts
erred
in
permitting
two
witnesses,
the
husband
and
wife,
namely
the
kahns,
who
had
pleaded
guilty
in
a
separate,
similar
but
separate
case
involving
the
same
crime
to
take
the
stand
over
not
only
to
petitioner's
objection,
but
over
their
own
counsel's
objection
when
both
the
court
and
the
prosecution
knew
in
advance
that
such
witnesses
would
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
further
self-incrimination.
from
the
beginning,
in
reliance
upon
this,
the
counsel
has
cited
throughout
his
brief,
the
united
states
versus
maloney
in
1959
where
mr.
justice
hand,
learned
hand
of
new
york
in
the
second
circuit
held
that
in
a
similar
instance,
it
wasn't
quite
as
similar
as
this,
because
the
witness
on
the
stand
was
not
--
had
never
been
a
defendant
in
the
case,
the
particular
witness
involved.
but
the
attorney
for
one
of
the
defendants
there
also
represented
the
witness
testifying
and
he
requested
the
court
to
advice
the
witness
of
his
constitutional
privileges,
which
the
court
did.
despite
that,
the
witness
was
compelled
to
testify.
justice
hand
in
reviewing
the
doings
of
that
court
stated
that
it
was
reversible
error
to
force
a
witness
to
take
the
stand
under
those
circumstances.
and
as
in
this
case
here,
the
government
knew
in
advance
as
did
the
court
below
that
the
kahns
who
undoubtedly
were
essential
to
the
government's
case,
but
whether
they
are
a
necessity
in
the
government's
case
should
overshadow
the
danger
and
would
say
were
headed
to
further
incriminate
themselves
and
subject
themselves
to
further
indictment
is
one
of
the
issues
before
this
court.
counsel
advised
the
court
immediately
following
the
government's
opening
to
the
jury
and
the
bench
conferences
to
which
i
had
alluded.
while
the
kahns
had
admittedly
confessed
their
guilt
to
failure
to
fulfill
the
requirements
of
the
26th
united
states
code,
i
believe
it
was
sections
44/11
and
44/12,
they
had
only
pleaded
guilty
to
a
conceivable
conspiracy,
which
could
arise
out
of
any
testimonial
in
their
part.
they
had
only
pleaded
guilty
to
conceivable
bribery
of
a
federal
official
to
income
tax
evasion,
federal
income
tax
evasion
and
they
were
compelled
to
take
the
stand.
it
was
felt
by
counsel,
who
not
withstanding
the
government's
brief,
was
not
trying
to
engineer
a
case,
but
was
looking
out
for
the
best
interest
of
the
kahns
and
they
coincidentally
represented
during
this
trial
to
not
further
subject
themselves
to
future
incrimination.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
they
are
not
petitioner's
here,
admittedly
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
if
the
kahn's
were
testifying
concerning
a
further
crime,
these
crimes
might
also
involve
the
petitioner.
that
was
the
same
case,
which
was
before
mr.
justice
hand
in
the
united
states
versus
maloney,
neither
was
a
witness
there
a
defendant.
the
witness
was
not
a
--
while
an
acknowledged
part
of
a
conspiracy,
he
had
never
been
indicted,
but
he
was
represented
by
the
same
counsel,
who
represented
one
of
the
defendants
in
the
maloney
case.
and
thus
was
the
reasoning
of
mr.
justice
hand
that
the
witnesses
in
that
case.
and
again,
it
was
the
--
for
the
trial
court
to
force
the
witness
to
take
the
stand.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
that
is
a
further
part
of
my
argument,
your
honor
in
the
so-called
popular
term
guilt
by
association.
and
that
i
would
attempt
to
develop
as
i
proceed,
but
that
is
the
salient
but
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
the
same
set
of
facts
confronted
mr.
justice
hand
in
new
york.
and
then,
in
the
maloney
case,
mr.
justice
hand
in
arriving
at
his
position
stated,
which
partially
will
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
goldberg,
by
virtue
of
the
commonwealth
knowing
in
advance
--
the
government
knowing
in
advance
that
these
witnesses
will
avail
themselves
in
the
fifth
amendment,
an
inference
would
be
created
by
their
failure
to
answer
the
questions
put
to
them,
which
inference
would
they
almost
like
an
unseen
cloud
pulled
over
to
the
jury.
and
the
jury
would
treat
that
as
evidentiary
and
the
jury
would
be
conjuring
up
what
the
answer
might
have
been
had
the
witness
answered,
whether
it
was
the
kahns
or
somebody
else.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
there
was
a
same
transaction
–
well,
for
instance
the
kahns
would
be
asked
the
question
which
they
were
asked,
did
you
have
any
business
relations
with
the
defendant?
there
was
an
objection,
there
was
an
invocation.
the
fifth
amendment,
it
was
sustained,
that
is
in
the
transcript.
now
the
jury
would
conceivably
sit
there
and
try
to
conjure
up
what
the
answer
would
have
been.
in
other
words,
what
did
the
kahns
have
to
hide,
why
didn't
they
say
yes
or
no?
well,
knowing
fine
technical
distinctions
of
the
law,
now
as
this
approach
or
inference
would
roll
across
the
courtroom,
the
counsel
had
no,
the
defense
counsel
for
namet
had
no
opportunity
to
cross
examine
that
inference,
which
was
the
evidenced
being
put
into
the
jury's
mind
indirectly.
the
inference
further
under
mr.
justice
hand's
rulings
was
to
avoid
of
the
sanctity
of
a
note.
and
counsel
feels
this
apparently
mr.
justice
hand
felt
to
strip
any
defense
counsel
in
this
way
of
the
excalibur
of
cross-examination
is
to
erase
the
search
for
the
truth,
which
cross-examination
is
supposed
to
be
and
is
designed
to
produce.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
there
were
some
witnesses,
some
questions
counsel
didn't
object
to
their
name,
where
they
lived,
what
they
did,
how
long
they
owned
the
property
they
had.
those
were
harmless
questions
to
which
counsel
didn't
object.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
matters
along
that
line.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
and
there
were
other
questions,
which
in
the
course
of
this
trial,
having
in
mind
that
the
kahns
have
pleaded
guilty.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
it
was
virtually
a
retrial
or
an
opening
up
of
their
trial
by
questions.
did
you
accept
wagers?
yes,
i
did
accept
wagers.
they
had
already
pleaded
guilty
to
that,
which
counsel
pointed
out
to
the
court.
now
again,
there
was
a
–-
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
i
am
not
saying
that
is
a
general
statement.
i
don't
believe
that
statement
would
hold
through
generally.
i
am
saying
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
for
instance,
there
it
is
conceivable
whether
it
could
be
government
witnesses
that
were
called
to
the
stand
and
they
might
be
custodian
of
public
documents.
they
would
have
no
conceivable
danger
in
invoking
the
fifth
amendment.
it
might
be
a
witness
who
saw
at
a
distance
a
crime
occurring,
an
eyewitness
might
be
a
[inaudible]
or
a
witness
who
was
present
when
statements
were
made
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant
who
was
in
an
outer
circle
from
the
arresting
officers
so
to
speak.
there
are
many
instances
where
you
conceive
that
a
government
witness
could
not
possibly
incriminate
himself
and
would
have
no
need
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
i
say
this
case
is
unique
mr.
justice,
because
here
the
government
knew
from
the
information
being
before
it,
from
the
dockets
of
the
court
before
it,
that
kahns
were
within
[inaudible]
this
entire
matter,
which
involved
mr.
namet.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
that's
right,
there
is
no
question
about
that
and
government
even
admitted
that
on
their
bench
conferences.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
again,
as
a
court
ruled
in
sustaining
the
objections
at
--
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
i
believe
they
did
your
honor,
where
they
said
it
was
a
legal
conclusion.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
prior
to
that,
there
was
an
--
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
it's
relevant.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
prior
to
that,
there
was
another
question.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
well,
now
they
wanted
to
explain.
again,
i
go
back
to
the
inferences
of
--
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
of
course,
i
think
i
agree
with
your
honor
too.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
of
course,
your
honor,
dealings
of
one
thing.
what
were
the
extent
of
the
dealings,
having
in
mind
that
nature
of
the
kahn's
business
was
primarily
the
conduct
of
variety
store
and
again,
they
confess
that
they
took
bet
in
that
variety
store.
there
was
nothing
to
say
what
the
nature
of
the
dealings
where.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
what
i
say,
set
as
my
original
--
hoping
as
i
told
the
trial
of
judge
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
that
kahn
should
ever
have
been
put
on
the
stand.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
well,
there
was
a
question
before
that
your
honor
which
was
not
admitted.
did
you
have
any
business
dealings
was
the
question.
and
the
trial
of
justice
asserted
that
call
for
illegal
conclusion,
so
what
the
dealings
were.
then
the
question
was
rephrased
to
omit
the
word
business.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
well,
many
people
had
dealings
with
the
kahn.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
i
can't
see
the
relevancy
of
it.
i
failed
to
see
the
relevancy
of
that
question.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
yes.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
that's
right.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
he
didn't
say
that
to
me,
no.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
he
called
for
a
conference
between
--
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
well,
i
believe
your
honor
that
the
--
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
i
did
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
well,
when
we
had
these
various
conferences,
the
judge
was
--
let's
say
on
my
side
one
time
and
the
government
side
the
other
time,
and
it
was
never
completely
clear
just
what
his
feeling
was.
in
other
words,
in
the
testimony
of
the
--
in
the
conversations
of
the
bench
conferences
its
replete
what
the
judge's
own
statements
to
the
government,
what
would
you
have
done
if
the
kahns
had
not
pleaded
guilty?
do
you
have
enough
evidence
without
them?
and
the
government
answered
we
have
--
admittedly,
we
don't
have
a
strong
case
without
the
kahn's.
then
after
a
few
more
questions
by
the
kahns,
another
recess
was
had.
the
trial
judge
stated
to
the
government,
“i
don't
see
how
i
can
let
you
proceed
with
the
kahns,
you
are
going
to
put
them
in
jeopardy
of
further
indictment.”
and
then
there
was
a
suggestion
that
the
kahns
be
released
from
the
court,
be
sent
home.
and
the
judge
himself
told
and
then
further
instructed
the
u.s
attorney,
“you
better
keep
the
witnesses
here,
you
might
be
criticized
downstairs.”
and
it
went
back
and
forth
on
seesaw
effect
like
that.
there
was
no
clear-cut
idea
as
to
just
what
was
the
conviction
of
the
judge
in
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
not
relevant
to
the
namet's
case.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
there
was
no
evidence
of
--
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
they
never
had
one
iota
of
evidence
that
namet
was
every
present
when
a
bet
was
taken
in
the
counsel.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
they
had
evidence
he
was
in
and
out
of
the
store.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
i
would
say
this
is
relevant
your
honor
if
namet
--
unless
an
agent
was
inside
to
say
he
stood
there,
saw
namet
present
when
bets
were
being
taken.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
well,
may
i
put
–-
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
may
i
put
it
this
way
your
honor,
there
was
an
--
that
exact
question
came
up
in
relation
to
another
store,
when
namet
had
entered,
as
he
was
followed
around,
and
the
government
witness
on
the
stand
testified
to
the
effect,
the
bets
were
taken
in
that
store.
i
objected
again
on
the
same
ground
as
to
where
was
it
material
to
namet,
because
unless
they
can
place
him
in
the
store
and
bets
were
being
taken.
the
judge
received
me
upon
that.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
well,
a
prosecutor
at
that
time
felt
that
if
he
could
get
the
court's
permission
to
put
the
khans
on
the
stand,
he
could
go
the
distance
and
ask
them
many
questions,
open
up
everything
and
bring
out
evidence
of
what
happened
or
things
that
occurred
when
mr.
namet
wasn't
present.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
i
didn't
put
the
query
that
way
your
honor,
but
i
thought
i
had
tried
to
make
that,
so
that
is
my
position.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
that's
very
true
your
honor
and
in
answer
to
that,
the
government
in
its
brief
has
said
that
the
--
or
the
government
as
they
went
along
in
this
case
have
no
time
knew
other
than
the
mere
statement
of
an
attorney
as
to
what
the
khans
would
do
well.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
virtually
the
only
way
i
can
see
--
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
well
i
--
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
that's
right
your
honor
--
they
are
not
objecting
themselves.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
he
is
prejudiced
very
much
i
think
of
this
way
that
his
counsel
is
stripped
of
the
right
of
cross
examination
to
an
inference,
which
has
been
created,
an
important
inference.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
as
guesswork
in
the
part
of
the
jury
is
a
conjunction.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
it's
one
of
the
--
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
unless
the
–
as
a
judge
putting
this
case
and
by
the
remark
of
counsel
was
in
an
enviable
position
and
--
that's
true.
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
that
was
the
government's
position
if
they
and
--
mr.
john
h.
fitzgerald
insofar
it's
the
one
information
to
which
they
have
pleaded
guilty
was
concerned,
they
didn't
have
a
wagering
tax.
