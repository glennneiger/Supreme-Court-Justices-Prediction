justice

what
did
the
prosecutor
say
was
the
relevancy
of
having
these
witnesses
ask
questions
before
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
when
it
was
known
that
their
answer
would
be
--
they
wouldn't
answer
it
because
of
the
fifth
amendment?
what
did
the
prosecutor
say
was
the
relevancy
of
having
them
making
that
claim
before
the
jury
instead
of
having
the
court
act
on
it
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury?
what's
the
relevancy
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
suppose
that
your
objection
is,
i
haven't
heard
you
say
it
yet,
but
i
thought
that
was
it,
that's
it
was
certainly
not
relevant
or
proper
deliberately
to
put
witnesses
on
the
stand
and
ask
them
questions,
which
would
tend
to
incriminate
this
defendant
when
it
was
known
in
advance
that
they
would
refuse
to
answer
on
the
ground
of
self-incrimination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
your
objection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
not
claiming
that
it
is
not
relevant
to
ask
them
some
questions
about
this.
what
you
are
saying
if
there
was
jury
on
court,
as
i
understand
it,
not
to
put
these
people
up
there
and
make
them
refuse
to
answer,
when
it
was
known
in
advance
and
as
frequently
done
by
prosecutors
that
that
would
have
a
bad
effect
on
the
defendant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
very
common
factor
[inaudible]
committed
something
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
say
they
won't
testify
without
incrimination
may
be
two
or
three
hundred
times.
the
idea
being
that
the
[inaudible]
they
are
guilty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
more
than
that,
isn't
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
everybody
knows
if
you
get
a
witness
who
is
associated
with
somebody
else,
some
kind
of
bet
and
you
are
[inaudible]
kind
of
been
connected
with
one
another,
if
the
prosecutor
can
[inaudible]
get
in,
as
that
man
standing
before
the
jury
and
not
going
to
testify
on
the
ground
of
discriminating,
it
does
more
than
affect
the
witness,
it
affects
the
other
man.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
may
not
be
sufficient
to
reverse
the
case,
but
i
would
think
it
would
[inaudible]
prejudices
on
the
circumstances
at
the
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
its
testimony
that's
put
in
against
him
as
the
testimony
relevant,
prosecutor
knows
it,
that's
one
thing
of
course,
but
if
they
put
somebody
up
there
and
make
them
do
something,
they
know
that
they
won't
do.
what
right
do
they
have
to
use
that
as
a
method
for
convicting
the
defendant,
if
they
going
to
draw
inferences
from
the
claiming
of
the
privilege.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
have
you
viewed
the
record
as
i
have
read
it,
but
as
you
view
the
record,
did
the
prosecuting
attorney
ask
any
questions
of
the
kahns
which
the
court
had
told
him
in
advance
in
his
chamber,
he
would
not
compel
them
to
answer.
so
i'm
free
to
say
that
that
has
[inaudible]
to
do
with
the
case.
i
do
not
agree
in
other
words
that
at
this
time,
that
the
statement
that
you
could
never
put
a
witness
on
the
stand
if
he
says,
i
claim
the
privilege.
i
do
not
agree
with
the
idea
that
a
prosecutor
can
run
rough
shot
over
the
government
of
what
the
judges
told
him
he
couldn't
do
it
inside
the
court
and
get
it
for
the
purpose
of
having
him
claim
the
privilege
in
the
court.
what
i
understood
is
what
this
record
shows
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
what
i
thought,
what
this
record
shows
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
challenging
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
was
--
the
government
did
have
knowledge
of
something
when
the
judge
told
them
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
there
were
certain
things
they
would
not
let
him
ask.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they
been
convicted
for
taking
wagers
from
this
man
namet?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
had
not
--
that
is
it
had
not
been
adjudicated
in
the
prior
case
where
they
pleaded
guilty
or
whether
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
this
question
was
one
that
was
related
to
this
defendant
on
trial,
and
which
was
precisely
inline
with
what
the
court
had
told
him
they
couldn't
ask
him,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
it,
i
understand
it.
the
reason
i
am
asking
is
this,
i
do
think
it
would
be
wrong
and
lawless,
as
the
judge
looked
into
and
they've
came
up
with
the
claim,
and
said
now
we
are
going
to
claim
this.
it
precisely
is,
the
judge
said,
i
would
agree
you,
and
you
claim
that
that
you
got
it
right.
then,
i
would
say
if
the
prosecutor
takes
them
in
and
the
jury
has
to
make
that
claim
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
think
he
did
it
for
any
reason
on
earth
except
to
get
the
advantage
whatever
it
is
from
having
that
constitutional
privilege
claimed
by
the
witnesses
and
i
wouldn't
think
that
was
correct
on
the
part
of
prosecutor.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
of
course
that
is,
without
that
there
would
be
no
relevancy
to
it
unless
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
you
are
[inaudible]
with
that
been
said
the
layer
said
they
were
going
to
do
and
nobody
objected
on
the
ground
and
hadn't
asked
them.
the
only
way
that
could
be
proven
that
the
lawyer
meant
what
he
said
and
the
witnesses
wouldn't
testify
without
the
question
asked
in
open
court
or
the
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
that
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
judge
went
on
to
say
didn't
he,
he
says
that's
[inaudible]
criminal,
i've
got
to
go
along
with
it,
probably
if
i
doubt
her,
i
could
examine
her
in
private.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
judge
showed
pretty
clearly
that
he
thought
that
this
time,
now
this
could
be
held
in
private.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
it
have
to
be
about
that
question,
there
had
been
private
proceedings.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
judge
had
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
there
was
no
challenge
that
affected
the
law,
he
was
truthfully
stating
this
about
his
witness
because
that's
a
defender
about
his
witness.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
saying
the
prosecuting
attorney
had
a
right
somehow
to
say
keep
back
in
the
back
of
his
mind
well
now
later
on
when
this
comes
up
i
will
say
that
--
witness
didn't
say,
this
is
just
the
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
right,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
rather
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
have
to
agree
there
the
circumstances
well,
you
know,
on
which
that
shouldn't
be
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
two
brothers
are
charged
with
a
crime,
both
of
them
are
there,
they
try
and
went
out
and
the
brother
comes
there
and
its
already
brought
out
for
the
jury,
they
are
together
and
the
lawyer
goes
and
says,
now
look
here
i
don't
want
them
to
ask
them
a
question,
because
he
is
going
to
claim
his
privilege,
and
that
hurt
me
before
the
jury.
would
you
say
that
that
would
be
a
proper
proceeding
for
the
prosecuting
attorney
knowing,
let's
assume
that
he
knows
that
he
is
going
to
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
you
say
that
if
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
going
to
hold
out
on
the
basis
of
maybe
of
witness
then
the
lawyer
may
not
be
telling
the
truth.
it
would
his
duty
to
say
it,
wouldn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
know
the
defendant
himself.
well,
and
he
had
told
them
in
advance,
i
want
to
claim
my
privilege.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
it's
just
a
difference
in
degree
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
--
i
do
not
understand
that
you
would
say
what
that
question
implies
from
what
i
understand.
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
if
the
prosecutor
thinks
he
can
get
some
[inaudible]
to
convict
a
man
by
bringing
a
witness
up,
who
is
going
to
claim
his
privilege
of
self-incrimination
and
the
prosecutor
puts
him
up
for
that
purpose,
that's
it.
he
knows
that
the
judge
won't
let
him
in
that
that
would
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
can't
simply
draw
the
distinction
on
the
fact
that
one
of
them
is
the
defendant
and
one
on
them
is
a
witness,
can
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
you
can?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
not
on
the
basis
merely
that
one
is
a
defendant
and
one
is
a
witness.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
judge
hastings'
statement
in
the
tucker
case,
it
was
called
to
out
attention,
where
he
said
that
two
circuit
courts
of
appeals
have
already
warned
that
[inaudible]
interrogation
which
has
no
apparent
purpose
which
invite
invocation
of
privilege
against
self
incrimination
is
improper
and
is
likely
to
constitute
reversible
error?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
statement
he
said
there
–
he
also
said
that
in
our
view
interrogating
official
himself
gravely
abuses
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
when
believing
a
truthful
answer
will
incriminate
a
witness
he
nevertheless
insists
on
that
incriminating
question
with
the
view
to
eliciting
claim
of
privilege
thereby
creating
a
prejudice
against
the
witness
or
some
other
person
concerned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
understood
–-
