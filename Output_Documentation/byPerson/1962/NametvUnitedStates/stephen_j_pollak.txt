mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
review
of
the
petitioner's
criminal
conviction.
as
opposing
counsel
has
stated
he
was
found
guilty
of
violation
of
the
internal
revenue
code
by
failing
to
register
and
pay
the
taxes
as
to
one
engaged
in
the
business
of
accepting
wagers.
at
this
trial,
the
government
called
mr.
and
mrs.
kahn,
proprietors
of
a
variety
store
in
chelsea
and
people
who
had
admitted
to
revenue
agents
that
they
had
acted
as
agents
in
their
store
for
petitioner
in
the
wagering
operations.
they
had,
as
stated
here,
also
pleaded
guilty
to
separate
information,
making
charges
based
upon
their
actions
involving
the
petitioner.
there
are
two
issues;
the
first
issue
raised
and
the
only
issue
raised
by
the
petitioner
is,
whether
the
government
was
properly
permitted
to
call
mr.
and
mrs.
kahn,
where
the
petitioner's
lawyer
had
informed
the
court
and
the
government
that
he
had
advised
them
to
plead
their
privilege.
essentially,
we
believe
this
issue
is
whether
the
defense
counsel
may
block
material
witnesses
and
material
and
relevant
evidence
by
informing
the
court
before
trial
that
he
has
advised
those
witnesses
to
claim
their
privilege.
we
believe
that
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
fifth
amendment
would
warrant
giving
this
control
over
an
opposing
party's
case
to
the
opposing
counsel.
the
parties
must
be
free
to
call
and
question
witnesses
known
to
be
able
to
give
relevant
evidence
so
that
each
party
may
present
his
case.
there
is
a
second
issue
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
it
only
came
from
counsel,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
second
issue,
which
i
will
just
state,
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
by
the
government
in
our
memorandum
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
and
it
concerns
the
cautionary
instruction,
which
the
court
gave
on
the
inferences
which
could
or
could
not
be
drawn
from
the
claim
of
the
privilege.
the
question
here
is,
whether
that
instruction,
which
we
concede
to
have
been
defective,
was
so
prejudicial
as
to
require
a
new
trial
where
there
was
no
objection
prior
to
the
retirement
of
the
jury
and
where
the
issue
was
not
raised
at
any
appellate
level
or
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
mean
to
spend
as
petitioner's
counsel
addressed
himself
most
primarily
to
the
first
issue
on
the
propriety
of
the
calling
kahns.
i
mean
to
spend
most
of
my
time
on
that,
but
let
me
state
that
we
raised
this
issue
for
the
court's
consideration.
the
court
took
this
case
we
took
that
to
mean
that
this
court
wished
us
to
make
the
review,
which
we
initially
suggested
be
made
at
an
appellate
court
level.
so
we
endeavored
to
address
ourselves
to
that
issue
and
provide
the
court
with
a
briefing
and
an
argument
position
and
i'm
prepared
to
argue
that
point.
it
may
be
helpful
to
state
briefly
the
facts
on
which
we
think
the
issue
is
raised,
the
issues.
the
information
as
stated
were
brought
against
the
petitioner
and
the
two
kahns
charging
that
each
of
them
all
three
had
engaged
in
wagering
operations
with
failure
to
register
and
pay
the
tax.
my
opposing
counsel
has
detailed
the
evidence.
the
kahns
were
the
proprietors
of
one
of
the
stores
that
the
petitioner
was
observed
to
visit
each
day.
they
retained
at
same
counsel
and
plead
guilty,
on
the
morning
of
the
trial
as
stated
the
kahns
withdrew
their
plea
of
--
did
i
say
guilty
--
they
withdrew
their
plea
of
not
guilty
and
plead
guilty.
in
the
opening,
the
government
stated
that
it
would
believe
that
it
would
offer
a
husband
and
wife,
who
would
testify
that
they
had
acted
as
agents
in
petitioner's
wagering
operation
and
would
testify
to
the
procedures
of
that
operation.
at
a
bench
conference
immediately
following
this
opening,
petitioner's
lawyer
stated
to
the
court,
that
the
court
should
keep
in
mind
that
the
kahns
and
i'm
quoting
“were
defendants,
entitled
not
to
testify
in
their
own
case.”
the
court
stated
that
they
had
pled
guilty
and
the
defense
counsel,
petitioner's
defense
counsel,
stated
that
he
had
not
intended
to
wave
any
constitutional
privileges
in
pleading
them
guilty.
the
court
then
stated
that
he
hadn't
seen
them
on
the
stand.
if
they
took
the
stand,
if
they
made
a
claim
it
would
ruled.
thereafter
as
the
second
witness,
the
government
called
mrs.
khan.
she
answered
a
number
questions
voluntarily
stating
that
she
and
her
husband
were
proprietors
of
harvey's
variety
shop
in
chelsea,
that
they
knew
the
petitioner,
that
they
had
known
him
by
sight
for
a
couple
of
years.
thereafter
she
was
asked
if
she
had
a
business
relationship
with
the
petitioner
and
she
stated
“our
attorney
has
advised
us
not
to
answer
on
a
plea
of
the
fifth
amendment,”
her
attorney
of
course
was
also
the
defense
counsel.
thereafter
at
proceedings
outside
the
hearing
of
jury,
bench
conference,
the
court
ruled
that
because
of
her
plea
of
guilty,
mrs.
khan
could
be
questioned.
she
could
be
asked
what
she
did
and
she
had
seen
in
relation
to
the
defendant,
but
that
she
could
not
be
asked
questions
which
might
tend
to
incriminate
her
of
other
crimes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that
was
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
mr.
justice
black,
yes
sir.
the
government
described
in
stating
why
it
was
calling
mrs.
khan,
had
described
the
statements
that
she
had
given
to
the
revenue
agents,
stating
--
laying
out
the
direct
evidence
against
the
petitioner
which
she
was
aware
of.
she
had
been
the
petitioner's
agent
in
his
wagering
operation,
she
and
her
husband.
the
court
noted
the
spot,
the
defense
counsel
was
in
representing
the
various
parties
and
defense
counsel
stated
and
i'm
quoting
“in
pleading
her
guilty
he
had
not
intended
that
she
would
cooperate
with
the
government.”
then
the
court
as
it
was
pointed
out
i
believe
in
the
questioning
by
mr.
justice
white,
sustained
the
objection
on
the
ground
that
the
question
called
for
a
legal
conclusion.
immediately
thereafter
on
page
8
i
believe
of
the
record,
the
court
ruled
that
the
witness
could
be
asked
if
she
had
a
relationship
with
the
petitioner.
however,
the
government
did
not
put
that
question
to
mrs.
kahn,
the
government
asked
several
other
questions
to
which
she
gave
answers
and
then
when
there
was
an
objection
on
grounds
of
materiality
of
a
line
of
questioning,
mrs.
kahn
was
excused
without
claiming
the
privilege
again.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
think
that
would
make
a
difference,
and
i
intend
to
address
myself
to
that
directly.
i
just
have
one
more
statement
of
facts
on
which
this
issue
is
raised
that
i
think
is
important.
later
in
the
trial,
the
government
called
mr.
kahn.
he
was
asked
18
questions.
he
answered
ten
questions
voluntarily.
he
claimed
the
privilege
as
to
eight.
the
court
sustained
the
claim
of
the
privilege
as
to
four
questions
and
ordered
him
to
answer
the
other
four.
when
the
privilege
was
sustained
as
to
two
questions
in
a
row,
the
government
excused
the
witness.
now,
mr.
kahn
testified
voluntarily
and
under
orders
of
the
court,
court
ruling
that
he
had
no
valid
claim
of
the
privilege,
that
he
ran
a
store
in
chelsea,
that
he
knew
the
petitioner,
that
he
had
dealings
with
him
during
the
period
of
the
information;
that
he
had
accepted
wagers
in
his
store,
that
the
petitioner
came
to
his
store
not
everyday
and
not
twice
a
day,
but
came
to
his
store
several
times
a
week.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
there
were
some
questions,
your
honor,
as
to
which
no
objection
was
interposed
and
he
answered
those
questions.
we
mean
to
say
that
he
--
the
record
shows
that
he
voluntarily
testified.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
we
would
not,
but,
we
assume
that
if
there
is
--
if
the
question
is
asked
and
there
is
no
objection,
that
then
he
is
giving
a
voluntary
answer.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
our
position
is
your
honor
that
the
government
here
acted
properly
in
putting
him
on
the
stand
and
in
questioning.
we
do
not
mean
to
say
that
it
would
not
be
improper
under
some
circumstances
for
the
government
to
put
a
witness
on
the
stand
with
knowledge
that
the
witness
is
going
to
claim
the
privilege.
if
the
witness
is
placed
on
the
stand
in
bad
faith
for
purposes
of
forcing
the
claim
of
the
privilege,
we
would
think
that,
that
would
be
improper.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
do
not
believe
that
this
record
shows
that.
the
petitioner
has
cited
the
johnson
case,
texas
case,
and
we
have
cited
a
case
called
tucker
in
the
third
circuit.
i
might
just
mention
the
tucker
case.
in
that
case
that
it
was
coming
on
to
the
third
trial.
there
had
been
a
first
trial;
the
government
had
called
a
witness.
the
witness
had
pled
the
privilege
to
several,
a
string
of
questions.
the
trial
then
was
--
conviction
was
obtained,
there
was
a
reversal
on
appeal,
there
was
a
second
trial.
at
the
second
trail,
the
same
witness
was
called,
the
same
questions
were
asked,
the
same
privilege
was
pled.
the
third
circuit
said
upon
review
of
that
second
trial,
said
since
there
must
be
a
third
trial
and
reversed
the
second
conviction,
since
there
must
be
a
third
trial,
we
state
that
the
government
should
not
call
this
witness
unless
it
has
knowledge
that
he
will
now
no
longer
claim
the
privilege
or
that
it
has
--
well
the
court
really
didn't
expatiate
on
that.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we're
not
challenging,
no
your
honor.
we
also
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
justice
goldberg,
we
do
not
think
that
those
questions
were
--
require
a
reversal
here.
we
think
that
there
are
several
points
that
are
important.
prior
to
the
asking
of
those
questions,
the
witness
had
answered
five
questions
voluntarily.
the
six
previous
questions
he
had
been
ordered
to
answer.
so
he
had
proceeded
to
answer
six
questions.
we
believe
that
in
light
of
the
court's
ruling
in
the
case
that
the
witnesses
could
be
asked,
what
they
had
done
and
what
they
had
seen
in
relation
to
the
petitioner
that
these
questions
were
within
the
parameters
laid
down
by
the
court.
and
that
counsel,
again
i
might
stress
that
defense
counsel
had
never
asked
here
for
proceedings
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
jury.
we
think
on
the
top
of
23
that
the
court
perhaps
even
invited
such
proceedings.
no
question
was
--
no
request
was
made
for
that.
the
government
lawyer
here,
we
think
the
record
really
--
you
can
smell
it
if
you
read
the
record
that
the
government
lawyer
was
trying
to
be
careful,
not
trying
to
overreach,
he
was
trying
to
represent
the
public
in
placing
the
case
before
the
jury.
and
that
these
questions,
these
two
questions
as
you
pointed
out
the
witness
was
then
released
after
the
two
questions
were
asked,
came
within
those
parameters.
now
the
--
i
don't
think
that
the
government
attorney
can
be
taxed
with
being
certain
under
the
circumstances
here
that
the
witness
would
make
the
claim.
i
might
address
myself
to
that
for
a
minute,
because
this
petitioner
has
not
argued
here
for
a
broad
rule
in
the
oral
argument,
we
think
the
facts
of
the
case
are
also
important.
here
the
court
stated
that
the
government
--
that
the
defense
lawyer
was
in
the
spot,
in
representing
witnesses
and
the
defendant
at
the
same
time.
i
think
it's
particularly
appropriate
here
for
the
government
to
have
determined
whether
these
witnesses
intended
to
plead
the
privilege
themselves
and
it
really
didn't
become
clear.
they
continued
to
give
voluntary
testimony,
so
that
where
there
is
an
advice,
the
only
advice
that
the
government
had
from
the
defense
counsel
was
that
he
had
advised
these
witnesses
to
claim
their
privilege.
he
did
not
inform
the
government
that
they
would
claim
their
privilege
or
so
far
as
the
record
shows.
he
perhaps
candidly
said,
he
had
advised
them
to
claim
their
privilege.
in
the
background
was
the
plea
of
guilty
to
the
charges
involving
the
very
transactions
and
the
government
went
into
the
case
relying
on
the
decisions
as
it
read
them
believing
that
there
was
no
basis
for
a
claim
of
a
privilege
at
all.
there
is
some
suggestion
in
the
reina
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right.
we
don't
--
we
of
course
cannot
state
that
the
government
proceeded
without
knowledge,
that
there
were
--
that
there
might
possibly
be
objections
to
certain
questions
or
a
claim
of
the
privilege
would
be
sustained
as
to
certain
questions,
but
it
never
had
knowledge
that
the
privilege
would
actually
begin
to
pose.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
they
had
been
convicted
of
failing
to
register
and
failing
to
pay
the
tax
while
engaged
in
wagering
operations.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
face
of
the
information
did
not
refer
to
namet.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
no.
as
we
read
the
court's
ruling,
he
stated
that
they
could
be
asked
what
they
did
and
what
they
saw
in
relation
to
namet
and
what
they
did
in
relation
to
namet
is
taking
wagers
in
relation
to
namet.
i
might
say
your
honor
that
there
has
not
been
an
objection
made
as
to
the
court's
ruling
as
to
what
questions
would
be
allowed
and
what
questions
would
not.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
we
may
--
the
government
may
differ
mr.
justice
black
in
this
respect,
the
--
we
feel
that
there
is
some
burden
upon
the
lawyer
for
witnesses
or
a
lawyer
for
a
defendant
to
see
that
the
witness
make
it
certain
that
the
witness
will
claim
the
privilege.
i
pose
this
situation,
this
is
what
--
this
is
the
rule.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
we
do
not
believe
that
it
was
certain
that
these
witnesses
would
continue
to
claim
their
privilege.
what
the
court
or
what
the
government
had
was
the
statement
of
the
attorney
for
the
defendant.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
believe
that
in
the
absence
of
a
request
by
the
defendant's
lawyer
for
proceedings
outside
the
hearing
of
the
jury,
the
government
was
entitled
to
proceeding
the
normal
way.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
and
we
are
very
concerned
that
the
rule
contended
for
by
the
petitioner
would
exclude
witnesses,
exclude
material
evidence
from
the
jury.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
we
think
that
under
the
circumstances
of
the
questioning
of
the
witness
where
he
had
proceeded
to
answer
several
questions,
where
it
was
still
unclear
as
to
the
intention
of
the
witness
to
claim
the
privilege,
as
to
question-by-question
that
the
government
in
these
circumstances
was
entitled
to
--
it
was
entitled,
we
claim
in
good
faith
to
test
the
parameters
of
what
the
witness
was
willing
to
answer
and
that
there
is
at
least
a
basis
in
an
ongoing
trial
here
for
the
government
to
believe
that
these
question
were
within
the
court's
prior
ruling.
there
may
have
been
some
conflict
in
the
position
that
the
court
was
taking
as
to
what
would
and
would
not
permitted.
of
course
the
case
comes
up
in
a
situation
where
there
was
considerable
doubt
as
to
whether
the
witnesses
had
any
claim
of
the
privilege
available
to
them
at
all
since
they
had
pled
guilty
and
since
these
questions
we
are
asking
them
about
the
very
transactions
out
of
which
their
information
arose.
i
don't
mean
to
override
the
point
that
the
name
of
namet
wasn't
on
the
information,
but
that
was
the
only
basis
on
which
the
information
was
brought.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
suppose
the
government's
response
to
that
your
honor
is
that
we
--
this
was
for
the
defense
counsel
to
ask
if
he
wished
proceedings
out
of
the
voir
dire
proceedings
that
was
never
requested.
we
don't
know
why
that
wasn't
requested.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
there
has
been
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
there
has
been
no
request
by
the
defendant
for
proceedings
at
which
the
witness
was
questioned
in
advance
of
the
appearance
on
the
stand.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
don't
make
any
--
there
is
no
dispute
that
he
advised
the
witness
to
make
the
claim.
he
never
told
us
that
the
witness
would
make
the
claim.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
think
that
there
is
–-
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
think
there
is
teaching
that
states
that
a
claim
of
the
privilege
much
be
personally
made
under
the
fifth
amendment,
the
maloney
case
cited
in
our
brief
and
we
don't
think
that
it's
unusual
for
the
witness
to
make
a
claim
so
that
it
can
be
ruled
on
by
the
court
and
that
these
proceedings
follow
that
procedure.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
this
is
the
lawyer
for
the
brother
who
is
so
advised.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
we
think
there
are
--
that
there
is
justice
learned
hand
said
in
the
mahoney
case,
there
are
--
there
is
no
general
rule
here
to
keep
witnesses
from
the
state.
we
think
that
the
circumstances
--
the
circumstances
will
show
and
overreach
by
the
federal
government,
which
we
don't
believe
is
present
here
or
an
overreach
by
a
prosecutor.
there
are
state
cases
which
have
charted
these
courses
and
we
think
that
johnson
case
cited
by
the
petitioner,
the
washburn
case,
both
texas
cases
show
over
reaching,
but
we
don't
find
an
over
reaching
by
the
prosecutor
here
in
the
circumstances.
we
think
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
in
judge
--
in
the
mahoney
case,
judge
hand
at
the
conclusion
of
his
opinion
rested
it
solely
on
the
fact
that
the
judge
had
not
given
a
cautionary
instruction.
he
did
not
rest
it
and
he
did
not
as
i
read
it,
rule,
that
the
calling
of
the
witness
was
a
reversible
error.
so
that
there
are
several
other
cases
in
the
new
york
second
circuit
they
seem
to
have
risen
most
there
that
hold
where
the
witnesses
entered
a
plea,
there
is
no
objection
to
calling
him
at
all,
but
we
recognize
it
in
those
cases,
the
practice
in
new
york
at
least
with
those
indictments
have
been
the
charge
both
conspiracy
and
the
substantive
crime,
a
situation
we
didn't
have
here.
we
think
also
that
it
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
we
could
not
call
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
i
think
we
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
think
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
don't
take
that
position,
i
am
sure
that
there
is
no
suggesting
that
the
government,
that
the
government
is
taking
that
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
draw
the
distinction
on
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
draw
the
distinction
on
whether
the
government
as
the
record
shows
call
the
witness
in
good
faith
for
a
purpose
of
giving
material
evidence.
we
believe
that
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
don't
think
we
would
make
that
--
just
draw
that
line,
because
we
recognize
that
there
are
some
circumstances
where
a
witness
knowing
he
will
plead
the
fifth
amendment,
knowing
that
the
court
will
sustain
the
plea
and
knowing
for
example
that
he
has
almost
no
material
evidence
to
give
that
he
wouldn't
claim
the
privilege
to
or
none,
i
make
that
flat
none,
then
the
governments
would
be
calling
him
in
bad
faith.
but
here,
we
review
the
record
and
we
find
there
are
three
things
to
review,
whether
the
witness
is
in
a
position
to
give
material
and
relevant
evidence.
this
witness
was.
this
witness
did
give
material
and
relevant
evidence
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
belief
that
he
wouldn't
claim
the
privilege.
there
was
such
a
reasonable
basis
here
as
to
both
mr.
and
mrs.
kahn.
one,
they
had
pled
guilty;
they
had
shown
a
willingness
and
pled
guilty.
two,
they
had
given
statements
to
the
revenue
agents,
we
had
no
reason
to
believe
they
wouldn't
continue
to
give
bad
account,
and
three,
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
the
court
would
not
sustain
the
claim
of
the
privilege
and
that
the
time
we
call
them
we
thought
that
the
privilege
would
not
be
sustained
on
the
background
of
this
case.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
we
believe
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well
there
are
differences
in
the
situation
in
which
the
cautionary
instruction
rises,
although
we've
attempted
to
state
carefully
our
position
in
the
brief
on
that
issue
which
we
raise.
we
take
it
from
judge
hand's
opinion
that
the
objections
to
the
lack
of
a
cautionary
instruction
were
presented
and
pursued
by
the
--
at
the
appellate
level
by
the
attorney
for
mr.
mahoney,
something
that
has
never
been
done
here.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
think
you
are
correct
mr.
justice.
at
the
trail
–
at
the
trial
it
reads
as
if
the
defendant
was
willingly
have
nothing
to
say
and
in
fact
judge
hastings
set
it
on
that
ground
and
said
that
the
defendant
should
have
that
within
his
own
purpose.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
have
studied
those
two
cases.
in
one
of
them
the
court
held
that
it
was
not
reversible
error,
that
was
the
five
cases
case
and
in
amadio
it
also
held,
if
i
am
right,
my
memory
may
not
serve
me,
but
in
amadio
they
did
not
reverse
as
well
but
in
the
tucker
circumstance
of
straight
track
–-
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
if
the
–-
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
if
it
shows
that
he
did
that
with
a
view
to
eliciting
the
claim
of
the
privilege
i
would
agree.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
--
i
think
that's
the
position
we
have
taken
in
the
brief
that
where
knowing
the
witness
will
claim
the
privilege,
the
question
is
asked
in
bad
faith
for
the
purpose
of
the
eliciting
the
claim
that,
that
would
be
improper.
we
don't
believe
that's
presented
here.
