justice
john
m.
harlan
was
he
given
mr.
waldman,
was
he
given
the
names
of
the
two
lawyers?
justice
john
m.
harlan
told
about
them.
told
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
does
that
appear
in
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
say
where,
i'm
not
questioning
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
never
mind
go
ahead
sir.
justice
john
m.
harlan
go
ahead
don't
let
me
interrupt
you
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
the
character
committee
as
an
arm
of
the
court
simply
files
its
report
either
recommending
or
recommending
against
a
candidate,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
now
the
next
question
i
want
to
ask
you,
is
there
a
procedure
where
if
a
man
fails
to
be
certified
by
the
character
committee,
does
he
have
any
regress
before
the
appellate
division,
if
he
chooses
to
contest
its
recommendation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
a
fact?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you
are
saying,
i
take
it
mr.
cohen.
as
we
examine
this
record
which
is
referred
to,
which
i
understand
is
in
the
clerk's
office,
the
question
we
have
got
to
decide
is
whether
either
in
1948,
1960
the
appellate
division
abused,
violated
a
due
process
by
denying
a
hearing
on
the
basis
of
what
was
presented
to
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
that
the
only
thing
in
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
we
got
to
look
at
the
record,
now
where
is
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
big
it
is?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
noticed
that.
how
big
is
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
big
is
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
i
would
like
to
ask
another
question
if
i
may?
i
am
puzzled
by
this
amicus
brief.
is
there
a
representative
of
the
bar
association
in
the
court
room?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
know
what
the
--
there
seems
to
be
a
difference
of
view
between
the
committees
on
some
subjects
in
relation
to
this
amicus
brief
and
i
can't
put
my
finger
on
what
the
difference
is?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
an
old
fashion
trade.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
an
old
fashion
trade.[laughter]
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
unless
things
have
changed,
since
i've
been
practicing
in
new
york,
i
would
suppose
that
an
applicant
who
had
been
denied
admission
to
the
bar,
where
there
is
a
matter
of
inherent
power
of
the
court
or
under
article
78,
could
file
a
petition
in
the
court,
in
the
appellate
division
saying
that
he
has
been
improperly
denied
admission
on
the
basis
of
an
ex
parte
report
of
the
character
committee.
and
if
the
appellate
division
thought
there
was
substance
to
it,
they
would
appoint
a
referee
to
investigate
the
matter
and
make
a
report.
now,
am
i
incorrect?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
question
was
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
know
what
the
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
it's
[inaudible]
sometime.
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
honor,
excuse
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
was
going
to
ask
you
perhaps
you've
answered
it
and
i
state,
as
to
what
relief
you
are
requesting
here,
that
he
be
--
as
if
this
court
directed
his
admission
to
the
bar
or
that
it'd
be
--
the
case
be
sent
back
with
the
directions
that
he
be
accorded
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
