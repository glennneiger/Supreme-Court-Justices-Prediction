mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
your
honor
and
justices
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
possibly
one
of
the
clearest
answers
that
can
be
given
to
the
petition
in
this
case
was
indicated
by
the
procedure
here
this
morning
when
in
connection
with
admissions
to
the
bar
of
this
court,
each
applicant
was
required
to
produce
somebody
who
would
certify
that
the
applicant
satisfied
the
requirements
of
the
bar
of
this
court.
new
york
has
a
similar
requirement
with
respect
to
its
bar.
the
process
of
admission
as
mr.
willner
has
stated
has
been
entrusted
by
the
new
york
courts
to
the
various
appellate
divisions,
the
four
appellate
divisions
throughout
the
state.
each
of
these
appellate
divisions
dealing
with
residence
in
its
own
district
has
what
has
been
described
as
a
character
committee.
this
character
committee
can
affect
forms
for
the
large
group
of
applicants
to
the
bar
in
new
york,
the
same
function
that
was
performed
here
this
morning
by
previously
admitted
members
of
a
bar
of
this
court.
it
examines
into
the
character
of
each
applicant
and
if
the
committee
is
satisfied
as
to
the
applicant's
character
and
fitness
it
certifies
to
the
appellate
division
that
the
applicant
is
entitled
to
admission.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
it's
not
exactly
like
yours,
it's
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
exactly
your
honor,
in
effect
there
is
a
monopoly,
but
it
is
a
monopoly
which
exists
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york,
they
–
there
isn't
any
challenge
as
i
see
it
to
the
procedural
provision
that
requires
the
endorsement
by
the
committee
that
is
not
the
question
that
is
been
presented
either
by
mr.
waldman,
for
his
client
or
by
the
bill
of
rights
committee
of
the
bar
association,
which
has
filed
a
brief
amicus.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
no,
that's
not
agreed
to
at
all.
the
–
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
an
admission
were
denied
arbitrarily
in
new
york,
there
is
a
procedure
under
–
we
submit
under
article
78
of
the
civil
practice
act
which
would
provide
for
review
of
any
arbitrary
action
by
the
committee.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
your
honor
is
absolutely
right,
if
this
is
in
effect
an
investigating
committee
of
the
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
[inaudible]
was
applied
at
the
court
for
admission,
he
can
attempt
review
as
i
suggested
by
article
78.
the
situation
here
with
mr.
waldman
--
with
mr.
willner
but
the
–
apparently
at
no
time
after
his
various
denials
to
be
applied
directly
to
the
appellate
division
for
review
of
an
action
by
the
committee,
the
–
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
i
think
that
is
a
fact
and
i
think
that
the
record
will
bear
that
out.
there
were
various
applications
that
were
made,
various
boards
of
applications,
but
if
i
can
get
down
to
the
facts
briefly,
possibly
i
can
show
you
exactly
what
happened.
the
first
application
that
was
made
by
mr.
willner
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
well
to
those
questions
one
at
a
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
in
response
to
your
first
question,
there
are
no
absolute
requirements
that
i
can
find
in
the
new
york
statute
for
any
hearing.
there
are
no
absolute
requirements
for
cross
examination
or
confrontation,
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
no,
the
statute
does
not
prescribe
in
any
sort
of
detail,
the
procedure
that
is
to
be
followed
by
this
committee.
the
committee
is
primarily
an
investigating
committee
and
is
so
designated
in
the
statutes
which
provides
for
its
creation.
the
committee
is
--
has
its
procedure
prescribed
only
in
or
approximately
a
very
limited
degree
by
stating
that
one
of
the
procedures
that
it
can
require
from
an
applicant
is
that
he
submit
two
affidavits
in
support
of
his
application
by
attorney
showing
his
good
moral
character.
apart
from
that
the
committee
is
pretty
much
left
on
its
own
as
an
investigator
for
the
court,
as
an
arm
of
the
court,
to
go
out
and
to
obtain
its
information
in
the
manner
in
which
it
deems
it
best
to
obtain
the
information.
there
are
no
limitations
on
its
processes
of
investigation.
the
committee
advertises
as
soon
as
an
applicant
files
his
application
with
the
committee
and
transmits
the
certificate
that
he
has
satisfied
the
scholarship
requirements
by
passing
the
bar
exam.
committee
advertises
in
the
law
journal
the
names
of
the
persons
who
have
applied
for
admission.
attorneys,
other
persons
who
see
the
advertisement
in
the
law
journal
respond,
send
in
whatever
information
they
have.
the
committee
itself
has
investigators.
the
staff
is
a
relatively
small
staff,
who
are
able
to
go
out
and
to
check
up
on
the
information
that
they
receive,
but
the
ultimate
function
of
the
committee
is
not
to
pass
upon
the
application
for
admissions
to
the
bar,
not
to
adjudicate
that
a
person
is
not
entitled
to
admission,
but
simply
to
transmit
to
the
appellate
division
when
it
receives
this
information,
which
is
unfavorable.
now
when
there
is
no
such
information,
when
there
is
nothing
which
comes
before
the
committee,
which
acts
as
sort
of
a
danger
signal,
a
warning
to
the
committee
that
it
should
stop.
the
committee
is
in
a
position
where
it
can
certify
that
an
applicant
is
entitled
to
admission
to
the
bar.
when
information
comes
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
yes,
page
four
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
no,
that
certificate
is
sent
to
the
appellate
division
and
the
appellate
division
acts
on
it
pretty
much
pro
forma.
in
most
cases
they
will
admit
a
very
large
class
at
one
time,
sometimes
it
comes
to
300
or
400.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
now
this
is
the
pathological
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
they
get
in
touch
with
the
applicant.
they
bring
him
in
for
–
before
a
sub-committee,
generally
consisting
of
three
to
five
members.
in
this
particular
department
they
work
with
two
sub-committees
both
consisting
of
five
members
generally.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
this
was
the
procedure
back
in
1937
and
1938.
originally
however
in
this
particular
case
they
brought
him
in
before
a
three-man
sub-committee
as
was
stated
and
mr.
wieder
was
confronted
with
these
letters,
or
this
--
the
record
indicates
one
letter
at
that
particular
time,
which
had
been
received
filing
a
compliant
against
him.
presumably
he
was
informed
as
to
the
substance
of
the
complaint.
the
sub-committee
apparently
thought
there
was
enough
here
to
worry
about
to
have
a
full
hearing
and
a
hearing
was
arranged,
mr.
wieder,
however,
was
not
informed
beyond
apparently
the
substance
of
this
letter
as
to
the
nature
of
the
compliant
that
had
been
filed
against
him.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
mr.
willner.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
they
are
so
much
alike
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
wieder
is
the
complainant.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
mr.
willner,
the
applicant
was
the
only
person
present.
willner
is
the
applicant
for
admission,
and
no
one
was
present
at
the
hearing.
these
hearings
are
held
privately,
secretly,
confidentially,
so
that
the
facts
as
to
an
applicant
are
not
exposed
to
the
public
at
large.
applicants
as
to
whom
unfavorable
information
is
received
are
protected
against
publicity
on
such
complaints
and
there
is
--
and
possibly
they
may
not
turn
not
to
be
true.
willner
attended
the
hearing
and
as
justice
harlan
has
pointed
out
in
the
second
koenigsberg
case,
the
hearings
are
a
form
of
obtaining
information
from
these
applicants.
one
of
the
best
methods
of
obtaining
information
from
applicants
is
by
examining
them
on
the
basis
of
information
that
has
been
obtained
as
to
them.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
no.
the
complainants
were
never
brought
in
for
hearing.
this
was
not
an
adversary
type
of
proceeding,
apparently
what
happened
was
that
the
committee,
the
character
committee
sent
out
its
own
investigator
to
check
to
a
certain
extent
or
as
far
as
this
investigator
could,
on
the
details
of
the
complaints
that
were
filed
against
the
applicant
and
on
the
basis
of
the
report
that
was
brought
back
by
the
committee's
own
investigator,
the
applicant
was
examined
before
the
committee.
now,
he
was
given
notice
through
the
form
of
questioning
as
to
the
nature
of
the
charges
and
complaints
that
were
filed
against
him.
he
was
given
an
opportunity
to
deny
or
admit
the
charges,
in
connection
with
the
first
complaint,
and
the
first
complaint
was
that
this
applicant
had
attempted
to
serve
a
clerkship
where
the
attorney
weider
had
not
completed
it
for
various
reasons.
the
applicant
admitted
that
he
had
failed
in
his
questionnaire
before
the
committee
that
set
forth
the
fact
that
he
had
been
employed
by
weider.
now,
the
fact
of
employment
was
significant
because
it
indicated
a
non-disclosure
of
a
fact
that
apparently
the
committee
deemed
material.
in
view
of
the
fact,
this
man
actually
did
not
require
a
clerkship.
the
committee
apparently
did
not
dispose
completely
of
the
application
in
a
negative
form,
but
as
you
will
see,
as
you
go
through
the
history
of
this
case,
it
gave
mr.
willner
an
opportunity
to
come
in
supply
whatever
information
he
had
to
disprove
the
charges
in
the
complaint.
these
were
not
formal
charges,
this
was
just
material
contained
in
the
letter.
the
substance
of
my
argument
it
seems
has
to
be
reduced
in
view
of
the
short
time
that
i
have
and
i'm
not
going
to
try
to
quote
with
this
whole
record.
but
the
record
will
indicate
that
at
various
times
the
committee
deferred
its
disposition
of
this
matter,
granted
various
adjournments
in
effect
to
the
applicant,
to
give
him
an
opportunity
to
clear
up
his
record.
each
time
that
he
was
given
such
an
opportunity,
there
was
a
new
complaint,
there
was
something
else
that
appeared
that
was
disadvantageous
to
willner.
each
time
that
the
committee
set
this
matter
down
for
hearing
that
was
material
before
it
that
could
be
considered
as
reflecting
upon
his
character.
now,
there
was
no
formal
disposition
in
his
first
application
until
1938.
i
would
say
that
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
it's
a
very
general
finding,
your
honor,
which
indicates
that
the
committee
was
not
satisfied
as
to
that
this
particular
applicant
was
fit
for
admission
to
the
bar
and
that
he
had
the
moral
character
which
entitled
him
to
admission.
it
is
not
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
he
can
apply
to
the
appellate
division
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
--
at
that
time
he
can
apply
for
review.
he
can
move
his
admission.
it
seems
to
me,
might
have
some
sort
of
procedure
available
by
which
he
could
ask
for
a
hearing.
there
is
nothing,
which
prohibits
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
there
is
no
statute
on
it,
there
are
no
rules
and
regulations
which
have
been
prescribed.
there
is
just
the
general
procedure
that
is
available
either
by
way
of
motion
practice
in
new
york
or
by
way
of
our
so
called
article
78
review
the
determination
of
an
administrative
body.
now
in
effect,
what
mr.
waldman
suggests
that
we
throw
away
the
whole
book,
on
the
record
it
was
of
what
has
occurred
with
relation
to
the
applicant,
what
they
have,
what
i
have
set
forth
as
to
the
proceedings
before
the
character
committee.
the
various
hearings
that
were
held
in
1938,
1948
and
disregard
this
record
in
effect
what
he
is
asking
us
to
do
is
to
say
that
any
of
the
facts
before
the
committee
were
immaterial
because
his
client
was
not
given
the
right
to
cross-examine
and
to
confront
the
people
who
filed
the
first
two
complaints
against
him,
weider
and
dempsey.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
well,
our
experience
in
connection
with
these
cases
is
very
limited.
generally
what
happens
is
that
these
committees
treat
these
matters
as
non-adversary
proceedings.
they
have
no
ax
to
grind.
their
report
goes
to
the
court
as
an
arm
of
the
court.
it
is
then
up
to
the
court
to
determine
what
it
should
do,
but
the
court
is
in
a
position
where
on
its
own
motion,
it
can
direct
such
a
hearing,
it
can
direct
that
the
hearing
be
held,
whenever
it
wants
to
in
--
if
a
situation
develops
that
requires
a
trial-type
hearing.
most
of
these
cases
apparently
are
disposed
by
the
character
committee
in
a
manner
where
they
will
not
receive
ex
parte
any
information
which
the
applicant
is
not
given
an
opportunity
to
explain
or
to
deny
and
the
position
of
the
committee
is
that
it
proceeds
only
on
information
which
is
not
ex
parte.
now,
if
in
connection
with
any
particular
application
before,
the
committee
has
unfavorable
information,
information
that
makes
it
set
up
its
own,
and
so
here,
this
man
must
wait,
the
committee,
it
seems
to
me
is
not
acting
arbitrarily
if
it
has
in
its
possession
unfavorable
information.
in
this
particular
case,
the
assumption
is
that
everything
was
set
against
willner
in
these
first
two
complaints
was
credited.
if
the
complaints
were
completely
credited
and
as
to
the
first
one
of
the
charges
was
that
the
man
asked
for
a
false
affidavit
that
he
had
served
the
clerkship.
i'm
sure
that
if,
if
the
committee
had
accepted
that
that
it
would
never
have
allowed
willner
later
on
and
the
court
itself
would
not
have
allowed
willner
at
a
later
day
to
have
filed
a
new
application
for
admission
as
it
did
in
1948.
if
it
had
accepted
the
second
charge,
which
would
in
effect
was
that
willner
had
engaged
in
a
fraudulent
transaction
where
he
promised
that
he
could
put
through
an
rfc
loan
that
he
had
to
pay
moneys
to
an
rfc
employee
to
bring
about
the
loan,
if
these
charges
had
been
taken
in
hold
--
at
face
value
by
the
distinguished
members
of
the
bar
who
constitute
this
committee
then
it
seems
to
me
that
again
the
1948
application
would
not
have
been
allowed.
these
would
have
been
allegations
of
a
sort
that
would
have
so,
despite
the
man's
character
if
accepted
that
he
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
file
a
second
application.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
well
he
can
pick
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
answer
to
that
is
substantially
the
answer
i
tried
to
give
you
a
little
while
ago
and
that
is
that
the
application,
the
man
can
bring
his
case
to
court
and
say
this
is
what
happened,
this
is
how
i
was
examined
before
the
committee,
i
do
not
know
on
what
ground
my
application
was
denied
for
a
certificate,
not
my
application
for
admission,
the
application
for
admission
must
be
made
to
the
court,
i
don't
know
why
this
committee
is
not
giving
me
a
certificate.
i
ask
you
the
appellant
division
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
direct
the
committee
to
come
in
with
a
report
which
is
specific,
which
contains
findings
which
will
inform
me
of
the
basis
upon
which
my
application
has
been
denied.
now
he
did
not
do
that
at
the
time
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
he
can
get
such
a
hearing
by
applying
directly
to
the
appellate
division
which
in
its
inherent
power
has
the
right
to
grant
such
a
hearing.
there
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
he
didn't
do
that
when
he
--
what
apparently
what
happened
is
that
after
an
application
is
denied
the
applicant
is
notified
by
letter,
by
the
secretary
of
character
committee
that
his
application
for
a
certificate
of
good
character
has
been
denied.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
he
went
back
to
the
appellate
division,
but
at
the
times
that
he
went
back
these
manners
will
rather
stale.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
when
you
mentioned
the
first
time,
the
first
time
apparently
he
went
to
the
appellate
division
was
1943,
which
was
five
years
after
his
application
for
a
certificate
had
first
been
denied,
he
started
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
well,
in
1943
apparently
what
happened
was
that
the
appellate
division
denied
without
opinion
his
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
his
request
on
the
basis
of
the
report
that
has
been
transmitted
to
it
by
the
character
committee.
at
that
time
he
had
asked
for
a
hearing
relative
to
his
admission
to
the
bar
in
which
he
stated
that
he
deemed
it
inadvisable
to
set
forth
at
great
detail,
the
various
phases
of
testimony
and
the
basis
upon
which
his
application
for
admission
to
the
bar
was
denied.
now
that
very
allegation
would
seem
to
indicate
that
at
that
time
he
knew
i
had
a
pretty
good
idea
of
the
basis
upon
which
his
application
had
been
denied
back
in
1938.
his
hearing
before
the
committee
had
been
quite
extended
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
he
wanted
to
be
appraised
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
well
this
was
not
in
19
--
he
didn't
say
if
there
was
a
conspiracy
in
1943.
he
said
in
his
original
application
for
leave
and
we're
here
simply
on
an
application
for
a
leave
to
renew
his
application
upon
his
application
for
leave
to
renew
in
1961
that
there
was
conspiracy.
back
in
1943
and
this
record
is
rather
complex
and
i'd
had
to
dig
it
out
individual
file
papers,
he
said
that
he
knew
two
things,
first
a
considerable
stress
had
been
placed
at
his
hearing,
this
first
hearing
on
the
fact
that
he
had
set
forth
in
answer
to
a
request
for
information
that
he
had
served
no
clerkship.
he
didn't
hit
directly
on
the
point
the
fact
that
he
had
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
in
effect
that
was
what
he
asked
for.
he
asked
that
he
--
he
didn't
get
that
at
that
time.
there
isn't
any
explanation
that
i
can
find
in
the
record
the
appellate
division
disposed
of
thing
without
opinion,
i
can
only
speculate
that
on
the
basis
of
the
report
that
had
been
made
by
the
committee
and
you'll
find
a
reference
to
that
at
page
33
of
my
brief,
33
to
34,
the
committee
had
reviewed
the
testimony
and
the
hearings
at
which
willner
had
been
personally
present
and
in
addition
to
they
set
forth
certain
details
as
to
his
conduct
between
1938
date
and
1943
application.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
why
the
appellate
division
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
let
me
say
this,
i
would
say
that
all
of
this
material
is
rather
academic
as
back
to
1943,
because
the
appellate
division
actually
allowed
him
in
1948
to
renew
his
application.
i
would
say
that
every
--
well
let
me
tell
you
what
happened
in
1948.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
before
the
appellate
division?
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
well
he
--
apparently
various
representatives
of
his
have
seen
the
material
in
the
file
at
various
times.
it's
not
clear
whether
they
saw
the
confidential
reports
by
the
character
committee
to
the
appellate
division
that
little
gap,
which
may
not
be
considered
by
the
court
is
a
little
gap
is
missing.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
well,
i
would
say
that
he's
had
an
opportunity
to
defend
himself
against
it,
because
the
record
shows
at
first
he
was
granted
this
opportunity
in
1948
to
file
a
new
application
for
admission.
in
1948
it
appeared
that
he
had
testified
falsely
in
a
civil
proceeding
as
to
one,
whether
he
was
a
member
of
a
certified
public
accountants
associate.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
this
material
which
was
incorporated
in
the
various
reports
by
members
of
the
character
committee
to
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
he
had
made
an
application
before
the
appellate
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
i
don't
whether
these
motions
were
argued
orally
or
whether
they
were
submitted
simply
on
the
basis
of
the
motion
papers,
but
there
were
various
motions
returnable
before
the
appellate
division.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
he
never
requested
before
the
appellate
division
that
he
be
granted.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
he
asked
that
at
this
--
in
connection
with
a
particular
application,
which
is
before
this
court
for
review,
where
in
effect
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
well
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
i
think
the
answer
to
that
has
to
depend
upon
the
nature
of
function
that
this
particular
committee
performs.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
i
would
say
that
it
does
not
deny
him
due
process.
if
he
failed
to
request
at
an
appropriate
time,
a
hearing
before
the
court
itself.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
one,
it's
a
little
bit
tardy.
witnesses
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
just
about.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
i
think
it
is
because
witnesses
die.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
well,
i
think
he
is
pretty
much
in
the
same
situation
as
somebody
who
tries
to
get
certiorari
from
this
court
and
tries
at
about
six
weeks
or
20
days
too
late.
i
think
that
the
time
for
him
to
make
his
application
was
at
the
time
when
there
are
people
available
who
can
testify,
pro
or
con.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
well,
i
didn't
say
at
anytime.
i'd
say
within
--
under
your
new
york
statute,
the
provision
that
deals
with
the
ordinarily
review
of
the
determination
of
an
administrative
body
requires
that
an
application
for
a
view
be
taken
promptly.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
an
investigative
body.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
it's
an
investigative
body
primarily;
the
only
administrative
function
that
i
can
see
that
it
performs
is
to
issue
or
not
to
issue
a
certificate.
now,
if
you
--
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
think
that
the
question
has
ever
been
formally
presented
to
the
new
york
courts
for
review.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
in
this
particular
case?
in
1939?
in
1961,
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
in
may
1961
you
had
an
application,
which
was
an
application
addressed
to
the
discretion
of
the
court
for
leave
to
renew
an
application
for
admission
to
the
bar.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
they
just
denied
it.
the
reason
that
they
denied
it
is
not
clear.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
they
did
that
because
this
committee
and
the
court
itself
has
assumed
that
it
is
its
functions.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
possibly,
i
have
clouded
the
issue
rather
than
straighten
it
out.
but
let
me
say
this,
this
particular
committee
has
acted,
as
justice
harlan
indicated
a
little
while
ago
as
an
arm
of
the
court.
the
court
has
assumed
through
the
years
and
it
was
not
until
1960.
now,
that
in
any
case,
the
court
of
appeals
called
upon
the
attorney
general
to
submit
a
brief
or
to
argue
in
the
court
of
appeals,
any
appeal
connected
with
the
disposition
of
an
application
for
admission
to
the
bar.
the
matter
has
always
been
considered
as
an
intra-court
process.
the
character
committee
reported
to
the
appellate
division.
the
appellate
division
in
case
there
was
any
application
disposed
the
application.
if
an
appeal
were
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
papers
were
transmitted
just
as
they
were
in
this
case
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
it
was
not
until
the
disposition
of
matter
of
anonymous,
which
i've
referred
to
in
my
brief
in
1960,
that
for
the
first
time,
so
far
as
i
know,
the
court
of
appeals
called
upon
any
outside
agency
being
the
attorney
general's
office
in
that
particular
case,
and
the
attorney
--
this
is
the
second
time
that
it
has
called
on
the
attorney
general
to
intervene
in
a
case,
and
to
act
as
an
advocate.
the
theory
of
a
court
being
that
this
is
a
matter,
which
requires
the
court's
own
exercise
of
discretion,
apparently
being
--
that
the
theory
being
that
these
experienced
members
of
the
bar
will
not
out
of
hand
arbitrarily
or
otherwise
on
the
basis
of
ex
parte
evidence
dispose
off
any
applicant
arbitrarily.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
it's
exactly
what
they
say
we
have
done
here.
they
say
we've
acted
arbitrarily
because
we
haven't
given
this
man
a
hearing.
that
in
every
case
we
got
to
give
a
man
no
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
well,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
very
case,
which
they
cite,
this
matter
of
anonymous
that
came
through
the
court
of
appeals
last
year.
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
if
a
proper
application
were
made
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
papers,
they
would
be
allowed
to
be
examined
by
the
applicant.
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
afforded
that
opportunity
and
directed
that
the
confidential
file
be
supplied.
now,
one
of
the
difficulties
with
the
position
here
is
no
such
application
was
ever
made.
now,
the
failure
to
take
advantage
of
the
available
remedy,
it
seems
to
me
indicates
a
failure
of
advocacy
possibly,
a
lack
of
diligence
by
willner,
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
that
decision
was
handed
down
in
1960.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
when
you
say
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
this
is
not
this
case
i'm
about,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
i'm
afraid
that
your
honor
is
going
to
have
to
read
this
record
a
little
bit
more
carefully,
than
i've
been
able
to
explain
it
within
the
limits
of
a
30-minute
argument.
the
record
--
this
book
which
the
appellant
asks
us
to
disregard
completely
contains
facts
which
indicate
that
in
1943,
possibly
the
basis
upon
which
a
hearing
could
have
been
granted,
might
have
been
outlined
by
the
appellant,
but
there
would
not
have
been
at
that
time
an
arbit
--
yeah.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
there
is
no
reason
why
that
could
not
be
done
in
new
york
without
an
express
rule.
actually
what
happened
in
this
particular
case
was
that
apparently
the
court
concluded
that
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
you
have
the
facts
on
the
basis,
your
own
committee's
report
and
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
ordinarily,
i
should
say
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
well,
i
think
that
possibly
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
within
the
past
few
minutes
indicate
an
unwillingness
to
accept
what
has
been
the
traditional
method
of
dealing
with
applications
for
admission
to
the
bar.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
i
think
it's
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
it's
accurate
and
up-to-date
statement
of
the
–
of
the
committee's
procedures.
let
me
say
this,
the
bill
of
rights
committee
filed
its
brief
amicus
rather
late,
gave
me
very
little
chance
to
reply.
i've
done
as
well
as
i
could
within
relatively
few
days
in
getting
out
a
reply
to
the
bill
of
rights
committee.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
the
things
that
we
are
heading
for
in
this
discussion
of
the
case
is
a
question
as
to
whether
the
bill
of
rights
committee
is
correct
in
suggesting,
that
as
to
this
particular
type
of
investigation
in
to
the
conduct
of
a
particular
individual,
the
rules
which
ordinarily
apply
to
trial
type
hearings
should
apply.
now,
our
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
that
judicial
process
can
be
available
if
on
the
facts
that's
presented
--
a
showing
has
made
to
the
court
with
such
a
judicial
proceeding
as
warranted.
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
new
york
law
that
prohibits
that,
even
though
jersey
needs
to
have
a
specific
provision.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
yeah,
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
the
record
is
on
file
in
the
clerk's
office.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
it's
been
stipulated
between
the
parties
that
these
papers
which
were
the
original
papers
can
be
examined
by
the
court.
i
have
summarized
in
this
completely
as
i
can.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
pardon.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
oh!
i
would
say
that
this
no
higher
than
these
two
stacks
of
papers.
they
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
there
is
no
represent
--
i
gather,
they
were
allowed
to
file
a
brief,
but
not
to
argue.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
well,
they
have
said
it's
far
from
their
brief.
i
haven't
had
any
greater
advantage
then,
your
honor,
in
being
able
to
find
out
exactly
where
the
division
lies
in
the
committee.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
my
information
up
until
about
two
to
three
weeks
ago
was
that
they
were
not
likely
to
file
a
brief
in
connection
with
the
case.
apparently,
there
was
a
last
minute
switch,
a
brief
was
filed.
the
brief
is
addressed
primarily
as
i
can
see
it
to
this
trial-type
hearing
problem.
they
--
if
i
can
go
back
to
a
period
say
about
35
years
ago,
when
i
studying
with
mr.
justice
douglas
at
columbia
law
school,
i
might
say
this,
at
that
time
i
learned
not
to
over
generalize
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
yeah.
and
i
should
say
that
the
over
generalization
that
might
result
from
the
presentation
of
facts
by
the
bill
of
rights
committee
is
that
because
this
is
a
specific
type
of
investigation,
a
hearing
is
required.
now
i
think
if
we
read
carefully
what
your
honor
said
the
second
canningsberg
case
with
justice
frankfurter
has
said,
or
justice
cardozo
said,
when
he
was
a
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
state
of
new
york,
mccollum
case,
it
will
be
fairly
clear
that
the
tradition
in
this
specific
type
of
investigation
has
been
for
the
responsibility
to
be
placed
with
the
members
of
the
bar
or
the
court
to
find
out
and
ascertain
the
information
that
was
available
about
a
particular
applicant
and
if
issues
arise
with
relation
to
them,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
not
beyond
the
procedures
that
were
available
without
specific
rule,
without
specific
statute
in
new
york.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
--
for
the
court
to
give
any
man
who
says
that
he
has
been
denied
a
hearing
on
any
subject
and
under
appropriate
circumstances
where
the
court
deems
it
essential
or
proper
to
even
require
cross
examination
of
persons
who
filed
complaints
as
to
which
an
adjudication
maybe
necessary
before
a
determination
of
character.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
you
are
absolutely
right
your
honor,
not
incorrect.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
yeah.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
no
what
you
have
here
now
your
honor
is
an
application
for
a
leave
or
permission
to
renew
an
application
for
admission
to
the
bar,
25
years
after
it
was
first
denied.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
well,
that
may
have
been
due
to
his
own
awkwardness
in
applying
to
the
court.
mr.

well,
it
depends
upon
timeliness;
it
depends
upon
all
of
the
other
facts
that
are
contained
in
the
record.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
i
don't
think
that
that
has
been
done,
but
i
think
that
some
of
these
papers
indicate
that
he
had
a
very
clear
idea
of
why
his
application
had
been
denied.
let
me
go
back
to
1943,
when
he
made
his
application
in
1943
to
the
court,
he
said
--
so
that
committee
can
be
properly
apprised
of
the
various
places
at
which
he
has
resided
since
the
termination
of
the
prior
date,
prior
proceedings
and
hearings
in
1939.
if
instant
awareness
at
that
time
of
the
necessity
and
of
giving
the
committee
up-to-date
information,
which
was
what
he
hadn't
done
originally
and
he
set
forth
as
to
the
second
matter,
which
he
acknowledged
had
been
stressed
by
the
committee,
“my
failure
to
state
or
to
explain
more
fully
the
nature
of
certain
litigation
in
which
i
had
participated
at
or
about
the
time
of
my
consideration
before
a
set
committee.
a
particular
enquiry
was
made
of
me
by
the
clerk
and
of
the
character
committee
during
such
time
as
to
moneys
owed
by
me
and
litigation
pending.”
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
the
committee
made
no
findings
at
that
time.
it
just
supplied
a
confidential
report
to
the
court
and
that
report
indicated
all
sorts
of
other
conduct
between
1938
and
1943.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
no,
no
more
than
this
court
did
in
1954,
when
it
denied
certiorari
to
this
applicant
the
first
time.
this
court
denied
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
there
is
a
slight
difference
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
to
the
character
committee.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
by
reason
of
different
conduct
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
they
have
submitted
and
whether
they
are
or
not
it
depends
upon
that
type
of
conduct,
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
that's
substantially
an
outline
of
the
record
with
an
omission
of
the
details
as
to
the
nature
of
the
misconduct
that
was
involved
and
without
a
consideration
of
whether
the
conduct
that
he
was
guilty
of
in
the
first
instance,
which
was
clearly
reflected
in
the
record
not
as
to
the
details
with
--
as
to
which
there
might
be
a
dispute
was
the
type
of
conduct
which
might
be
considered
by
the
appellate
division
in
connection
with
his
application
for
leave
to
renew,
as
the
type
of
conduct
that
might
be
akin
to
cancerous
misconduct
or
whatever
it
was
conduct
that
was
trivial
that
might
be
overlooked,
where
the
man
quoted
some
later
date
in
someway
reprieve
themselves.
now
they
--
and
in
connection
with
an
application
to
renewal,
i
assume
that
the
basic
problem
before
the
court
is
whether
this
man
is
entitled
to
another
opportunity
to
appeal
before
our
character
committee
at
this
late
date.
that
is
something
that
seems
to
me,
which
is
purely
discretionary
and
which
should
be
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
state
admitting
court.
thank
you.
