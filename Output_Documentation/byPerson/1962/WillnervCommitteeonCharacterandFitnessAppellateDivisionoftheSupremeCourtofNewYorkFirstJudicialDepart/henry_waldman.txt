mr.
henry
waldman
yes
i
want
to
say
at
the
very
outset
that
i
have
been
practicing
law
more
than
60
years,
and
most
of
it
in
trial
and
appeal
work
in
courts.
well
that's
the
reason
my
voice
may
not
have
the
volume
and
i'm
going
to
ask
your
honors
to
bear
with
me.
mr.
henry
waldman
thank
you,
your
honor.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
unanimous
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york,
which
denied
the
petitioner,
willner
admission
to
the
bar.
willner
commenced
or
rather
applied
for
admission
some
25
years
ago.
it
was
denied
and
he
has
been
fighting
for
it
ever
since.
willner
was
the
son
of
immigrant
parents
who
were
impoverished,
and
unlike
we
often
read
about
young
men
who
work
their
way
through
college,
he
not
only
had
work
to
his
way
through
college,
and
four
years
of
law
school,
but
he
actually
had
to
work
his
way
through
elementary
school.
the
reason
of
the
fact
that
those
people
were
so
poor.
now
ordinarily
the
average
young
man
who
applies
for
admission
to
the
bar
is
about
the
age
of
25,
26,
27,
when
he
applied
he
was
a
mature
man,
36
years
of
age.
he
had
graduated
from
the
school
of
commerce,
new
york
university
with
a
degree
of
bachelor
of
commercial
science.
he
then
studied
law
for
four
years
and
graduated
first
as
a
bachelor
of
laws
and
then
as
a
master
of
laws,
and
that
exempted
him
from
having
to
serve
a
clerkship
in
a
lawyer's
office,
and
that's
very
important
in
this
connection.
he
was
married,
had
two
children,
a
boy
was
suffering
from
asthma,
was
living
in
new
york
and
then
decided
it
would
be
better
if
he
would
move
the
family
to
the
country,
or
at
least
--
and
he
moved
it
to
peekskill
up
in
westchester
county.
it's
about
30
miles
north
of
the
city
line.
and
he
had
to
make
a
living
and
what
he
knew
was
accounting,
he
practically
finished
his
accounting
course.
so
he
engaged
in
business
of
accounting,
and
that
of
course
brought
him
into
contact
with
people
who
had
to
do
business
with,
and
anyone
who
participates
in
the
activities
of
the
marketplace
is
bound
to
get
an
occasional
cuff,
bound
to
get
into
disputes
like
anybody
else
who
engages
in
business,
and
he
did.
he
got
into
a
dispute
with
a
lawyer
by
the
name
of
james
dempsey
and
i
am
not
going
into
details
regarding
it,
but
he
made
a
bitter
enemy
of
dempsey.
in
the
meanwhile,
he
had
taken
the
bar
examination,
had
passed
successfully
and
was
ready
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar.
now
admission
into
the
bar
in
new
york
is
delegated
to
the
appellate
division.
the
court
of
appeals
makes
the
rules
and
regulations
and
delegates
the
appellate
division,
the
business
of
admitting
attorneys
to
the
bar.
naturally
the
number
of
lawyers
who
apply
for
admission
is
very
large
in
new
york,
and
so
the
job
of
examining
the
character
and
fitness
of
the
applicant
for
admission
to
the
bar
is
delegated
to
a
committee
of
--
termed
the
committee
on
character
and
fitness.
it
consists
of
ten
members
and
they
are
all
supposed
to
be
eminent
lawyers.
willner
having
received
his
certificate
from
the
board
of
the
law
examiners
then
applied
to
the
--
or
bar
rather
appeared
before
the
character
committee.
mr.
henry
waldman
pardon?
mr.
henry
waldman
oh,
the
character
committee
is
appointed
by
the
presiding
justice
of
the
appellate
division
and
in
the
meanwhile,
while
waiting
to
receive
his
certificate
as
a
certified
public
accountant,
he
thought
it
advisable
to
open
an
office
in
manhattan,
and
he
sublet
from
the
firm
weidner
and
westall
[inaudible]
cost
of
$7.50
a
month.
that
office
was
apparently
managed
by
weider,
and
after
he
got
in
there
he
found
a
motley
crowd
of
subtenants,
one
was
a
bookmaker
and
by
that
i
don't
mean
one
who
publishes
or
writes
books,
one
who
takes
bets
on
races,
another
was
a
handicapper
and
as
soon
as
willner
saw
what
he
was
in
for,
he
walked
out,
and
meanwhile
he
gotten
into
row
with
weidner
and
weidner's
partner
also
realizing
the
sort
of
office
was
in,
dissolved
his
partnership
and
walked
out.
when
he
came
before
the
character
committee,
oh,
yes,
and
weidner
also
filed
a
complaint
--
mr.
henry
waldman
pardon?
mr.
henry
waldman
weider
did
and
dempsey
did.
mr.
henry
waldman
complaint
that
is
--
whether
it
was
in
affidavit
form
or
just
mere
letters,
we
do
not
know,
because
willner
was
never
permitted
to
read
them.
he
was
questioned
about
them,
and
the
committee
consisted
of
mr.
strook,
mr.
ellison
and
basil
o'connor.
apparently
when
he
appeared
before
this
committee,
he
was
questioned
very
sharply
and
he
became
very
much
nettled
and
probably
in
all
--
probably
spoke
rather
crudely.
in
any
event
he
apparently
made
a
bad
impression
on
this
committee
of
three
and
lo
and
behold
they
filed
a
report
which
stated
that
they
were
not
satisfied
that
he
possessed
the
character
and
fitness
requisite
for
a
member
of
a
bar
of
new
york.
mr.
henry
waldman
yes,
he
was
told
about
them.
mr.
henry
waldman
but
he
was
--
he
asked
the
committee
to
summon
these
two
men
and
confront
and
permit
him
to
cross-examine
them.
in
fact
what
he
demanded
of
the
committee
was
he
demanded
a
trial.
mr.
henry
waldman
oh,
yes.
mr.
henry
waldman
it
appears
in
the
transcript.
mr.
henry
waldman
pardon?
mr.
henry
waldman
now
he
--
that
was
in
1937
and
he
made
additional
applications,
about
five
or
six
more.
everyone
was
denied
without
opinion,
not
so
much
as
a
three
word
sentence.
all
unanimously
denied,
no
opinion,
and
to
this
day
he
doesn't
know
just
why
he
was
not
admitted
to
bar
except
of
course
he
assumes
that
the
dempsey
and
wieder
letters
probably
are
the
cause.
now,
the
right
to
a
trial,
in
a
case
of
this
kind
is
unquestioned.
when
i
mean
a
trial,
i
mean
he
has
the
right
to
face,
to
confront
his
accusers,
cross
examine
them
and
in
fact
have
a
trial
in
the
ordinary
and
the
usual
course,
where
common
law
procedure
and
rules
of
evidence
are
maintained.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
right
is
established
as
case
law
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
case
of
a
recoupment.
that
case
was
argued
in
1959,
but
decided
--
published
in
1960,
that's
a
long
time
ago,
but
that
case
has
never
been
overruled,
modified
or
qualified
to
my
knowledge
and
its
stare
decisis
is
still
in
force.
that
case
is
the
law
in
the
state
of
new
york.
now
that
case
stated
that
admission
to
the
bar
was
a
substandard
right.
in
other
words,
a
substantial
right
to
which
a
man
was
entitled
to
confrontation
and
all.
now
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
character
committee
every
time
is
served
with
papers,
never
appeared
either
by
serving
a
reply
to
the
petition
or
by
the
personal
appearance
of
one
of
it's
members,
all
of
whom
are
lawyers
or
of
it's
secretary.
he
simply
ignored
it
with
a
sort
of
silent
content
and
that
man
willner
where
every
few
years,
he
made
a
new
application,
denied,
the
character
committee
didn't
appear
and
the
appellate
division
simply
denied
it
without
opinion.
we
finally
got
the
petition,
which
initiated
this
proceeding
was
run
up
by
willner
himself,
though
i
think
with
the
aid
of
a
young
lawyer
friend.
in
any
event
he
appeared
pro
se
and
i
only
got
into
it
later.
the
petition
was
denied
by
the
appellate
division.
i
made
application
to
the
appellate
division
for
leave
to
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
was
necessary.
motion
denied,
then
i
made
an
application
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
my
amazement
and
joy
the
application
was
granted.
when
i
of
course
filed
a
brief
and
the
other
side
did
not
file
a
brief,
when
i
appeared
in
albany
before
the
court,
the
other
side
wasn't
there.
i
argued
the
appeal
for
about
20
minutes
and
two
days
later,
they
rendered
their
decision.
order
of
the
appellate
division
unanimously
affirmed,
no
opinion.
the
first
time
that
i
received
a
brief
was
when
i
filed
my
petition
for
certiorari
here.
and
then
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
up
here
filed
a
brief
and
from
the
--
but
only
really
said,
was
in
view
of
the
fact
that
his
application
had
been
denied
way
back
25
years
ago,
there's
no
reason
why,
the
petition
should
be
granted.
and
there
is
that
--
although
he
didn't
raise
the
claims,
res
judicata
and
in
my
reply
brief,
i
would
like
to
state
because
i
think
its
worth
stating
in
answer
to
his
claim,
a
distinguished
general
in
the
army
attended
a
social
function
in
full
dress
uniform
and
his
chest
covered
with
medals.
asked
how
he
got
all
of
these
medals,
he
said
the
first
i
got
by
mistake
and
the
others
because
of
the
first.
now
the
same
thing
here,
the
--
having
denied
his
admission
in
1936
and
they
contend
that
he
should
be
denied
admission
in
the
year
1963.
mr.
henry
waldman
i'll
only
take
a
minute
or
two.
in
the
first
place,
i
was
shocked
to
hear
mr.
cohen
say
that
under
the
new
york
practice,
an
article
what
he
terms
an
article
78
proceeding
could
have
been
brought
by
willner
to
test
the
validity
of
the
action
of
the
character
committee.
article
78
applies
only
to
a
proceeding
to
compel
an
administrative
agency
to
do
its
duty
and
has
nothing
to
do.
furthermore,
mr.
willner
at
someone's
suggestion
took
his
file
to
mr.
robert
roger
bryan
hunting,
the
secretary
of
the
bar
association
of
the
city
of
new
york,
and
mr.
hunting,
two
weeks
later
informed
him
that
there
was
nothing
in
that
in
his
record,
which
justified
the
denial
of
admission
of
the
bar.
and
i
might
say
this
day
willner
was
entitled
to
be
admitted
at
the
bar,
when
he
first
applied
and
in
view
of
his
age,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
20
years,
25
years
had
been
lost,
the
court
should
admit
him
to
the
bar,
direct
his
admission
to
the
bar
forth
with.
mr.
henry
waldman
yeah.
mr.
henry
waldman
to
send
it
back
for
a
rehearing
before
perhaps
a
hostile
--
mr.
henry
waldman
--
committee
and
why
the
man
has
gone
through
hell
over
the
25
years.
agony
and
some
of
the
wild
letters
that
he
wrote
anybody
else,
any
--
i
believe
i
would
go
berserk,
if
i
had
been
treated
that
way.
this
man
has
been
denied
justice,
just
simple
and
plain
justice
and
if
this
court
reverses,
please
do
not
send
it
back
to
the
character
committee
for
rehearings,
but
direct
his
admission
on
committee.
thank
you.
