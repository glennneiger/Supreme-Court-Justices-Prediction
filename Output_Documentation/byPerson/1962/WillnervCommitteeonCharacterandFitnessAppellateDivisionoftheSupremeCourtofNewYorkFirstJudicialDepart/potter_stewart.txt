justice
potter
stewart
filed
a
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
cohen,
i
assume
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
the
cases,
99%
or
so
cases
a
certificate
is
issued
by
the
committee,
by
the
character
committee
under
rule
1,
which
if
you
are
right
in
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
saying
that
the
applicant
is
entitled
to
admission
and
that
certificate
is
sent
to
the
appellate
division
is
it
or
to
the
applicant?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
now
we're
dealing
here
--
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
now
we
are
dealing
with
the
rare
case
where
the
committee
did
not
issue
such
a
certificate
and
what
do
they
do
before
they
fail
to
issue
a
certificate,
do
they
get
in
touch
with
the
applicant
or
what
happens?
justice
potter
stewart
and
really,
well
i
suppose
we
shouldn't
be
talking
about
what
was
the
procedure
back
in
1937
and
1938
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wieder
or
mr.
willner?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
mr.
willner.
mr.
wieder
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
the
complainant,
wasn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
so
there
was
conspiracy?
justice
potter
stewart
25
years?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
been
a
good
many
references
to
the
amicus
briefs
filed
by
the
committee
of
the
new
york
city
bar
association.
today,
you
filed
a
reply
to
that
amicus
brief
containing
at
the
end
of
it,
in
the
appendix,
a
letter
to
mr.
herbert
brownell
from
mr.
waldman
purporting
to
set
up
the
procedure
and
function
of
this
committee.
does
that
accurately
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
knowledge
--
to
your
own
knowledge
