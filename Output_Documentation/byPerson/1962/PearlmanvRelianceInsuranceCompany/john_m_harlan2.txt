justice
john
m.
harlan
would
the
--
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
would
the
government
have
had
the
right
to
use
moneys
in
it's
possession
when
it
becoming
new
under
the
contract
to
the
prime
contractor
to
satisfy
the
claims
of
the
materialmen?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
answer
to
my
question
would
turn
whether
the
materialmen
had
rights
against
the
government,
would
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
government
could
contract
certainly
with
the
--
with
the
prime
contractor
who
give
the
right
to
that,
asked
you
whether
it
might
have.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
or
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
under
this
contract
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
government
would
have
no
such
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
what
if
the
--
does
the
contract
exclude
as
between
the
government
and
the
prime
contractor,
does
it
--
the
contract
expressly
exclude
the
government's
right
to
utilize
funds
to
satisfy
the
claims
of
this
paid
materialmen.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
says
nothing
about
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
reason
i
asked
you
the
question
is
because
the
court
of
claims
dealt
with
the
somewhat
similar
situation,
analyzed
it
that
way.
