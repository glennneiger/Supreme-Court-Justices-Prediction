mr.
mark
n.
turner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
request,
if
i
may,
the
opportunity
to
review
the
brief
of
the
amicus
curiae
from
oregon
which
has
not
been
filed
or
served
if
i
may
have
just
a
few
days
in
which
to
reply
to
what
efforts
received?
mr.
mark
n.
turner
i'll
do
it
within
a
week.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
that
would
be
satisfactory?
mr.
mark
n.
turner
if
the
court
please,
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
discuss
very
briefly
some
of
the
matters
which
i
feel
are
landmarks,
so
to
speak,
which
we
feel
the
court
in
the
hinds
and
earle
cases
overlooked
or
misconceived.
in
the
first
place,
i
would
like
to
repeat
and
emphasize
that
the
respondent
surety
here
has
paid
all
of
the
job
creditors
on
this
job.
and
the
stipulation
further
provides
that
there
are
no
known
unpaid
job
creditors,
so
that
the
other
creditors
who
are
in
the
picture
here
have
claims
entirely
unrelated
to
this
st.
lawrence
seaway
job
which
the
reliance
insurance
company
bonded.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
reemphasize
the
fact
that
the
payment
and
performance
bonds
here
as
in
all
contract
surety
cases
is
not
any
form
of
insurance
or
protection
to
the
contractor.
the
contractor
is
and
remains
to
--
remains
the
principle
obligor
or
debtor.
it
is
his
first
obligation
to
pay
his
debts
and
complete
the
job.
a
surety
stands
secondarily
liable
only,
true
as
to
a
creditor,
a
surety
is
liable
equally
with
the
contractor
but
as
between
themselves,
the
surety
is
secondarily
liable.
and
following
that,
if
a
surety
pays
or
discharges
an
obligation
of
the
principle,
the
surety
is
entitled
so
far
as
may
be
possible
to
be
made
whole
by
the
contractor.
now,
the
trustee
in
this
situation
represents
or
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the
contractor.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the
contractor.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
so
that
whatever
rights
may
so,
as
between
the
reliance
insurance
company,
the
respondent,
and
the
petitioner
are
in
favor
of
the
surety
and
against
the
contractor
rather
than
vice-versa.
one
other
matter
is
this,
that
the
payment
and
performance
bond,
and
we
are
dealing
here
primarily
with
a
payment
bond,
is
an
undertaking
by
the
surety
and
the
principle
in
favor
of
the
united
states,
but
for
the
benefit
of
a
selected
group
of
the
contractor's
creditors,
not
his
general
creditors.
it
is
an
obligation
confined
by
its
terms
to
the
suppliers,
the
laborers
and
materialmen
on
that
particular
job.
mr.
miles
the
other
day
made
a
remark
that
there
were
some
general
creditors
whose
claims
antedated
the
making
of
this
contract.
i
don't
recall
any
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
in
the
record.
however,
i
feel
that
is
of
little
or
no
moment
because
we
are
agreeing
that
there
are
no
unpaid
job
creditors.
one
other
matter
and
that
is
this.
it
is
our
position
to
what
--
that
whatever
rights
the
laborers
and
materialmen
had
under
the
common-law
are
not
cut
down
or
limited
by
the
furnishing
of
this
bond
or
these
bonds
that
like
the
mechanic's
lien
laws
in
most
--
it's
not
all
of
the
states,
those
remedies
are
supplemental
remedies
and
merely
because
there
is
a
bond
present
in
the
case,
should
not
be
similar
and
tend
to
diminish
or
cut
down
the
laborer
and
materialmen's
rights
in
a
situation
merely
because
there
is
a
bond.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
say
--
mr.
mark
n.
turner
only
the
--
only
this
as
i
see
it
that
the
argument
is,
is
made
here
that
the
government
may
have
had
some
moral
or
equitable
obligation
to
be
sure
that
the
laborers
and
materialmen
were
paid.
but
that
it
fully
discharge
that
obligation
by
the
requirement
of
a
bond.
i
cite
it
that
--
only
for
this
reason
that
our
argument
is
that
despite
the
giving
of
the
bond,
that
there
still
exists
the
same
moral
or
equitable
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
see
that
the
laborers
and
materialmen
are
paid.
the
parallel
--
i
urge
no
farther
than
that.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
yes,
your
honor.
and
here,
i
would
like
to
allude
to
the
question
you
asked
of
mr.
miles
as
to
whether
or
not,
if
the
surety
were
in
some
--
mr.
mark
n.
turner
that
is
in
that
type
of
situation
because
in
the
mckinley
case,
decided
by
the
court
of
claims
and
certiorari
denied
in
this
--
in
this
court,
we
have
that
very
situation,
the
surety
was
insolvent,
the
contractor
was
insolvent.
there
the
rights
of
the
laborers
and
materialmen
were
given
effect
by
letting
them
share
to
the
exclusion
of
other
creditors,
the
job
moneys,
the
earned
--
the
earned
contract
moneys
--
mr.
mark
n.
turner
perhaps
in
a
manner
of
speaking,
but
it's
a
matter
of
fairness
and
equity
also.
and
in
the
westinghouse
case
decided
by
this
court,
there
we
had
a
situation
where
the
amount
of
the
undertaking
by
the
surety
was
insufficient
to
pay
all
of
the
job
creditors.
the
surety
paid
the
full
amount
of
its
penalty
--
of
the
penalty
of
its
bond
and
then
sought
to
share
in
the
bankrupt
estate
pro-rata
along
with
the
other
unpaid
creditors,
but
there
were
unpaid
job
creditors.
and
this
court,
very
properly,
it
seems
to
me,
said
to
the
surety,
“you
must
stand
aside
until
all
the
job
creditors
are
paid.
this
fund
is
for
their
primary
protection.”
and
there,
i
submit
is
a
shining
example
of
how
the
court,
sitting
as
a
court
of
equity
reaches
through
and
protects
those
who
are
entitled
to
the
proceeds
of
the,
of
the
contract
moneys.
also,
in
the
--
in
the
samson
case,
the
court
did
the
same
thing.
and
in
the
martin
case,
the
surety
had
an
assignment
but
became
bankrupt.
he
filed
the
assignment
and
said
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
job
creditors
as
this
court
had
no
hesitancy
in
allocating
to
the
job
creditors
the
proceeds
of
the
job
money.
our
opponents
concede
that
if
the
surety
in
this
case
paid
out
its
money
in
physically
completing
the
job,
we
would
be
entitled
to
the
contract
moneys
assuming
there
are
loss
equaled
or
exceeded
the
balance
on
hand.
i
maintain
and
suggest
that
in
the
fundamental
nature
of
things,
there
is
no
basic
difference
whether
the
surety
pays
out
his
money
under
a
payment
bond
or
a
performance
bond.
i
like
to
use
this
simple
formally
illustration,
a
brick
wall
is
being
built
--
mr.
mark
n.
turner
the
208
is
the
–-
mr.
mark
n.
turner
that
was
a
payment
bond.
the
prairie
--
the
prairie
state
bank
case
was
the
--
mr.
mark
n.
turner
it
was
a
performance
bond.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
straight
payment
bond
case.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
it
was
a
bond
covering
the
laborers
and
materialmen,
similar
to
the
one
here
involved
at
the
--
it
was
a
bond
given
under
the
old
heard
act
which
was
the
predecessor
of
the
miller
act.
and
the
only
difference
as
i
see
it
there
is
that
under
the
heard
act,
the
obligation
of
the
surety
was
expressed
in
one
piece
of
paper,
whereas
under
the
miller
act,
it's
two.
it
had
--
the
old
heard
act
had
certain
procedural
difficulties
requiring
the
laborers
and
materialmen
to
stand
aside
until
the
--
until
the
claims
of
the
government
were
satisfied.
and
if
the
claims
of
the
government
exhausted
the
penalty
to
bond,
the
laborers
and
materialmen
took
nothing.
under
the
--
under
the
miller
act,
there
are
two
separate
bonds,
one
running
to
the
government
with
respect
to
--
to
performance
or
completion,
the
other
one
in
favor
of
the
laborers
and
materialmen
only
for
their
protection.
i
would
like
to
reemphasize
that
basically,
i
see
no
difference
between
a
payment
and
a
performance
bond,
so
far
as
the
rights
of
the
surety
are
concerned.
a
brick
wall
is
being
built.
i
maintain
--
it
is
of
no
consequence
legally
whether
the
surety
contracts
in
advance
to
have
the
brick
lay
or
whether
it
pays
for
the
brick
after
the
brick
is
laid,
pursuant
to
its
obligation
previously
under
taken.
in
either
the
work
is
done
and
paid
for
by
the
surety's
money
acting
under
compulsion
or
pursuant
to
its
obligation
under
the
bond.
so
that
basically,
i
see
no
fundamental
difference
legally
as
to
whether
the
payment
is
made
by
the
surety
under
the
payment
or
the
performance
bond.
now,
i
would
like
to
treat
this
case
in
discussion
under
two
general
branches,
one,
the
affirmative
rights
of
the
surety
company
and
secondly,
the
absence
of
any
right
to
the
fund
by
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
the
early
case
of
course
was
the
--
was
the
prairie
national
bank
case
which
was
a
payment
bond
case,
followed
by
the
henningsen
case
which
is
a
--
of
the
--
the
prairie
bank
case
was
a
performance
case,
the
henningsen
case,
a
payment
bond
case.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
well,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
nut
that
was
at
a
time
when
both
obligations
were
physically
embraced
within
one
bond.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
yes.
the
bond
itself
was
both
a
performance
and
payment
bond,
but
the
question
issued
related
to
the
surety's
payment
of
labor
and
material
bills
as
distinguished
from
physical
completion
of
the
job.
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
rights
of
the
--
of
the
surety
here,
there
have
been
announced
three
general
avenues
of
recovery;
one,
by
subrogation
to
the
rights
of
the
owner
or
the
government
to
see
to
it
that
the
laborers
and
materialmen
are
paid.
the
rationale
of
those
cases
is
--
is
to
this
effect
that
by
requiring
the
contractor
to
furnish
a
labor
and
material
bond,
the
government
had
expressed
its
interest
and
moral
obligation
to
see
to
it
that
the
laborers
and
materialmen
were
paid.
and
that
stemming
from
that
moral
obligation,
they
had
a
right,
so
to
speak,
to
use
those
funds.
and
in
that
connection,
we
have
cited
the
mckinley
case,
the
martin
case,
the
westinghouse
case,
and
the
samson
case
as
indicating
that
when
the
chips
are
down,
so
to
speak,
and
there
is
no
other
source
of
recovery,
by
one
means
or
another,
the
government
and
the
courts
have
seen
to
it
that
what
we
maintain
is
the
government's
moral
obligation
to
see
that
laborer
and
materialmen
claimed
to
have
paid
has
been
accomplished.
so
that
while
--
while
it
is
true,
no
laborer
has
a
right
to
file
a
lien
on
a
federal
judge
or
to
sue
the
government,
still
no,
there
are
equitable
obligations
existing
there
which
under
the
proper
setting
or
in
a
proper
setting
are
given
expression.
and
there's
one
very,
very
interesting
case,
the
new
york
insurance
company
case
which
illustrates
rather
neatly
actually,
it's
the
court
of
claims
case,
the
direct
rights
of
the
surety
to
the
fund
that
was
a
case
where
the
government
had
no
interest
of
its
own
to
serve.
it
had
no
claims
either
for
--
for
the
completion
of
the
job
or
any
of
that
sort,
a
surety
had
paid
substantial
claims
under
its
payment
bond
and
had
notified
the
contracting
officer
of
the
existence
of
its
claim
or
that
it
had
--
had
paid
all
these
claims.
after
such
notice,
the
government
paid
over,
of
course
the
contract
moneys,
to
an
assignee
bank.
the
surety
then
brought
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
to
require
the
government
to
repay
the
money
which
had
been
paid
to
the
assignee
bank.
the
question
arose
on
the
pleadings
to
be
sure
but
the
government
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
petition
or
claim
on
the
ground
it
failed
state
tax
sufficient
to
constitute
cause
of
action.
that
motion
was
denied
and
the
court
there
said,
if
the
government
with
no
claims
of
its
own
to
assert
or
protect,
disregard
the
right
of
a
surety,
it
might
have
to
pay
twice.
i
only
cite
that
as
an
illustration
of
how
the
court
seeks
a
way
to
do
what
we
feel
is
simple
justice.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
you
mean
--
i
mean
the
case
here
at
bar?
not
in
the
formal
sense,
judge
goldberg,
but
we
do
feel
that
it
is
an
equitable
claim.
the
matter
has
been
spoken
of
in
various
ways,
equitable
lien,
equitable
right,
and
it
is
rather
hard
to
say
this
is
it
and
nothing
else.
it
has
been
variously
characterized
as
derivative
rights
to
the
fund,
direct
rights
to
the
fund,
equitable
lien,
equitable
claim
and
i
hate
to
--
i
hate
to
give
it
any
one
name
tag.
but
the
mckinley
case,
the
martin
case,
the
westinghouse,
the
samson
cases,
all
do
speak
of
the
equitable
rights
and
obligations
which
are
given
effect
to
in
the
court
--
in
a
court
of
bankruptcy
which
of
course
has
equitable
jurisdiction.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
well
there
of
course
--
mr.
mark
n.
turner
oh,
yes.
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
cited
some
cases
on
page
11
of
our
brief
--
well,
those
are
bankruptcy
cases.
on
page
--
on
page
21,
those
largely
come
up
on
the
--
on
the
second
branch
up
to
the
matter
i
was
--
as
to,
as
to
the
trustee's
lack
of
property
to
which
he
could
succeed.
they've
--
they
come
up
in
a
slightly
different
way
because
there
are
often
times,
there
are
a
mechanic's
lien
statutes,
and
i
refer
particularly
to
the
aquilino
case
and
the
durham
lumber
company
case
decided
by
this
court
not
too
long
ago
where
in
a
non-federal
contract
matter,
the
court
said
if
the
--
if
the
laws
of
the
state
under
which
the
matter
arose,
provided
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
bankrupts
lack
of
interest,
that
would
be
respected
by
this
--
by
this
court.
and
in
that
setting,
we
do
have
a
number
of
cases
which
we
have
--
have
cited
on
page
21
of
our
brief.
the
second
ground
of
--
of
the
surety's
rights
is
subrogation
to
the
rights
of
the
laborers
and
materialmen
and
that
is
the
basis
adopted
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
and
there
again,
it
springs
basically
from
the
same
general
situation
that
the
contract
funds,
arising
from
the
performance
of
the
contract
are
in
the
nature
of
trust
funds
dedicated
to
the
payment
of
labor
and
materialmen's
claims.
now
in
many
of
the,
in
many
of
the
states,
we
do
have
the
statutory
lien
provisions
constituting
trust
--
constituting
contract
moneys
as
trust
funds.
and
here
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
allude
to
my
adversary's
comment
that
there
is
no
reece,
there
is
no
trust
fund.
i
submit
there
is
one.
in
our
case,
we
have
$87,000
in
the
hands
of
the
--
of
the
trustee
through
until
the
actual
money
is
segregated
and
paid
out
by
the
--
by
the
comptroller
or
the
united
states
treasury,
it
is
in
a
mess
but
when
the
question
comes
up
for
decision
as
it
is
here,
the
fund
is
segregated.
we
know
that
these
funds
arose
from
the
--
from
the
performance
by
the
contract
of
the
physical
work
and
his
failure
to
pay
for
it,
and
the
surety's
payment
for
that.
and
through
this
--
throughout
--
throughout
these
cases
is
the
--
is
the
all
pervasive
idea
of
the
courts,
some
adopting
one
theory,
some
adopting
another.
here
are,
are
contract
funds
which
should
be
dedicated
as
though
they
were
in
formal
trust
funds
to
the
beneficiaries
who
produced
the
improvement,
the
subcontractors,
the
laborers
and
materialmen.
and
when
the
surety
company
discharges
those
obligations,
it
is
entitled
to
stand
in
their
shoes
and
assert
there
equitable
liens
are
priorities.
the
third
ground
is
assignment.
in
this
case,
prior
to
--
prior
to
the
giving
of
the
bond,
the
surety
--
the
contractor
execute
an
assignment
of
his
rights
to
the
surety.
all
contract
moneys
in
the
event
of
his
default.
we
urge
that
also
as
a
ground
of
relief
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
this
court
in
the
martin
against
national
surety
company
case;
selected
that
ground
as
the
basis
for
distributing
the
fund
to
laborers
and
materialmen
and
then
the
surety
was
insolvent,
but
the
court
took
it
upon
itself
to
divide
that
fund
among
the
job
creditors.
and
in
the
munsey
trust
case,
which
we've
cited,
the
1947
case,
it's
interesting
to
note
that
footnote
one
of
the
court's
opinion
in
that
case
said
that
where
the
rights
of
the
government
by
way
of
set-off,
which
was
the
munsey
case,
are
not
involved,
the
assignment
is
valid.
so
that
our
feeling
here
is,
will
the
government
having
no
interest
in
this
fund,
no
claim
for
taxes
or
any
other
claim
that
martin
against
the
national
surety
company
is
a
valid
subsisting
authority
for
the
support
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
respondent's
position
here.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
mark
n.
turner
yes,
your
honor.
by
with
the
bond,
not
the
bond
itself
but
the
application
for
the
bond
and
that
is
a
part
of
the
record
before
the
court.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
no,
we
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
in
the
state
of
new
york?
we
have
--
mr.
mark
n.
turner
we
have
--
yes,
we
have
the
usual
recording
statutes.
but
--
mr.
mark
n.
turner
we
did
not.
not
until
after
bankruptcy
and
for
entirely,
entirely
different
purposes.
but
the,
the
court
in
the
martin
case
--
this
court
in
the
martin
case
makes
no
point
of
the
--
of
the
recording
or
filing
of
the
assignment.
it
is
treated
as
--
as
an
assignment
in
equity
valid
as
between
the
parties
including
the
trustee
and
bankruptcy.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
mark
n.
turner
the
martin
case?
that
was
1937.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
yes,
but
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
--
in
the
19
--
in
the
munsey
trust
case
in
1947,
the
martin
is
cited
for
the
proposition
that
if
the
rights,
the
government
were
not
involved.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
i
know
of
none,
i
know
of
none.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
well,
under
the
terms
of
the
assignment,
it
was
not
to
be
effective
until
--
until
default.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
well,
it
might
not
have
been
avoided
because
on
the
analogy
of
a
mechanic's
lien
which
can
be
filed
within
four
months
or
after.
mr.
mark
n.
turner
not
in
that
respect,
not
in
that
respect.
i
would
--
i
would
like
briefly
to
--
to
pass
to
the
remaining
matter
here
as
to
the
absence
of
the
trustee's
rights.
the
trustee
here
has
not
expended
$1
of
the
general
assets
of
the
bankrupt
to
complete
this
contract
or
to
pay
the
bills.
whatever
payments
have
been
made
by
the
surety
here
did
not
deplete
the
bankruptcy
state
one
iota.
the
trustee
used
none
of
the
general
assets.
now
that
was
present
in
some
of
the
cases,
but
here,
there
was
not
one
iota
of
general
assets
used
by
the
trustee
in
completing
the
job
or
paying
expenses.
so
we
say
as
a
matter
of
equity,
bearing
in
mind
that
the
fundamental
rights
between
these
parties
to
this
appeal
are
in
favor
of
the
surety
against
the
contractor,
who's
represented
here
by
the
trustee
that
the
equities
run
in
favor
of
the
respondent
against
the
trustee
and
that
he
should
not
step
in
here
and
seek
what
in
effect
is
a
windfall,
and
share
in
a
fund
to
the
building
up
of
which
he
contributed,
little
or
nothing,
nothing,
so
far
as
the
general
assets
of
the
state
are
concerned.
one
remark
about
the
hinds
case,
in
our
view
of
the
case,
the
court
overlooked
some
of
these
fundamental
equities
and
treated
the
case
on
a
purely
legalistic
theory
which
as
i
read
it
here
that
in
as
much
as
a
laborer
or
materialmen
on
a
federal
job
had
no
legal
or
enforceable
rights
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
against
the
government
or
relating
to
the
contract
moneys
that
therefore,
the
payment
surety
in
paying
these
claims
were
subrogated
to
no
legal,
enforceable
right.
now
that
is
not
our
concept
of
the
law
that
is
applicable
here.
we
are
dealing
throughout
here
it
seems
to
me,
in
the
field
of
equity
what
is
fair
and
right.
we
respectfully
ask
that
the
order
of
the
circuit
court
be
affirmed.
