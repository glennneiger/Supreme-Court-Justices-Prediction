mr.
raymond
t.
miles
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
on
monday
of
this
week
issued
some
orders,
permitting
the
amicus
curiae.
murphy,
mr.
murphy
from
oregon
and
the
association
of
surety
company
represented
by
mr.
morgulas
to
file
amicus
curiae
brief.
that
brief
was
served
on
the
--
late
last
night
as
far
as
the
amicus
curiae,
mr.
morgulas,
the
other
brief
has
not
been
served
of
course
and
i
would
like
to
ask
that
this
court
give
us
a
short
period
of
time
say
10
or
12
days
to
have
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
one
brief
that
has
been
submitted
and
to
make
any
reply
that
we
deemed
necessary.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
thank
you.
now,
well
this
case
is
here
before
this
court
pursuant
to
a
writ
of
certiorari
then
in
directing
the
review
of
the
judgment
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
new
york
which
in
turn
had
reversed
a
decision
of
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
in
that
court.
i
would
like
to
review
very
briefly
the
facts
which
will
only
take
about
a
minute
or
a
minute
and
a
half
but
will
put
the
matter
in
proper
focus.
the
dutcher
construction
corporation
entered
into
a
contract
with
the
united
states
core
of
engineers
for
the
doing
of
certain
work
from
the
st.
lawrence
seaway
project.
this
was
in
april
of
1955.
at
that
time,
the
dutcher
construction
corporation
secured
from
the
fire
association
of
philadelphia
the
issuance
of
two
bonds.
these
bonds
were
issued
pursuant
to
the
miller
act.
there's
one
as
a
performance
bond
and
the
other
is
a
payment
bond.
they
run
in
favor
of
the
united
states
core
of
engineers.
subsequently,
the
fire
association
of
philadelphia
changed
its
name
to
the
reliance
insurance
company
and
that
is
the
name
of
the
respondent
in
this
matter
today.
in
april
of
1956,
the
core
of
engineers
terminated
the
contract
being
performed
by
the
dutcher
construction
corporation
on
the
st.
lawrence
seaway.
it
did
so
for
the
convenience
of
the
government
and
at
that
time
the
bankrupt
corporation
was
not
in
default.
however,
there
was
owed
to
suppliers
and
materialmen,
some
$329,000
which
the
reliance
insurance
company
has
since
paid.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
reliance
insurance
company
had
certainly
tended
the
expenses
and
then
later
discovered,
i
believe
that
there
was
another
supplier
that
came
under
the
roof
that
was
known
to
the
reliance
insurance
company
at
the
time
of
the
termination
of
the
contract
so
that
the
reliance
insurance
company
also
paid
that
supplier
and
the
total
amount
paid
by
the
reliance
insurance
company
to
date
is
approximately
$389,000.
the
contract
was
terminated
in
april
of
1956
and
dutcher
construction
corporation
became
and
adjudged
bankrupt
in
august
of
1956.
at
that
time
and
when
i
say
at
that
time,
i
mean
the
time
of
the
contract
was
terminated,
that
was
due
to
the
dutcher
construction
corporation
by
way
of
retainages
upon
the
government
contract
the
sum
of
$127,000,
but
the
engineers
took
the
position
that
there
should
be
some
additional
work
done
by
the
bankrupt
contractor.
and
accordingly
an
arrangement
was
entered
into
between
the
trustees
in
bankruptcy
of
dutcher
construction
corporation,
the
reliance
insurance
company
representatives
and
representatives
of
the
corp
of
engineers
by
which
a
group
of
joint
venturers
went
in
and
did
certain
work
which
the
corp
of
engineers
said
should
have
been
done
by
the
dutcher
construction
corporation.
and
this
was
pursuant
to
an
agreement
whereby
the
joint
venturers
whether
to
receive
not
over
$40,000
upon
the
completion
of
the
work
by
the
joint
venturers
on
the
st.
lawrence
seaway.
the
joint
venturers
received
the
sum
of
$40,000
from
the
united
states
core
of
engineers.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
yes
sir
and
the
balance
of
$87,000
is
the
amount
that
has
been
contended
for
today.
now
the
position
of
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
is
that
this
$87,000
should
come
into
his
hands
as
part
of
the
general
assets
in
the
bankruptcy
and
be
subject
to
the
claims
of
general
creditors
of
whom
the
reliance
insurance
company
would
be
one.
the
position
however
of
the
reliance
insurance
company
is
that
it
has
a
right
to
these
$87,000
which
is
superior
to
the
rights
of
the
general
creditors
of
the
bankruptcy.
now
primarily
we
res
--
we
rely
in
our
positions
--
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
i
think
that
all
of
this
is
for
the
suppliers
and
materialmen
as
distinct
from
wages.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
i
don't
believe
that
there's
any
laborers.
now,
our
position
is
that
we
are
sustained
by
three
cases
primarily
the
--
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
against
the
munsey
trust
company
which
was
decided
in
this
court
in
1947.
now
that
case
was
decided
by
mr.
justice
jackson
who
wrote
the
opinion.
there
was
a
situation
there
in
which
a
contractor
had
a
number
of
jobs
to
do
for
the
united
states
government
and
there
were
bonds
furnished
in
all
of
these
jobs.
the
jobs
were
completed,
but
the
materialmen
and
the
suppliers
were
not
paid.
the
contractor
also
had
another
job
to
do
for
the
government.
there
was
no
bond
furnished.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
opinion
itself
as
to
why
no
bond
was
furnished,
but
that
was
the
case
that
the
contractor
never
went
into
the
performance
of
this
particular
contract.
consequently,
the
government
had
to
secure
another
contractor
which
it
did,
but
the
other
contractor
succeeded
the
first
contractor,
did
the
job
at
a
cost
to
the
government
which
exceeded
the
cost
which
would
have
been
the
government's
cost
if
the
first
contractor
had
gone
through
with
the
job.
consequently,
the
government
took
the
position
that
it
was
entitled
to
setoff
the
excess
completion
cost
for
the
performance
of
this
unbonded
job
against
the
amounts
which
the
contractor
had
earned
and
which
were
being
held
by
the
government
as
retained
for
certitudes
and
this
court
held
with
the
government's
position.
it
stated
that
it
did
so
for
two
reasons.
the
first
was
the
strength
of
the
government's
position
as
a
creditor
which
had
a
setoff
against
that
which
it
owed
to
its
debtor.
but
the
second
reason
and
the
reason
which
we
stress
and
which
was
stressed
by
mr.
justice
jackson
in
his
opinion
was
the
weakness
of
the
surety's
position.
you
pointed
out
that
the
surety
had
paid
the
materialmen,
the
suppliers,
laborers,
and
that
is
therefore
succeeded
only
to
the
materialmen
and
the
laborers
and
consequently
could
rise
no
higher
than
they
could
and
they
had
no
enforceable
rights
against
the
government.
so
on
those
two
basis,
the
position
of
the
government
was
sustained.
now,
along
in
1958
came
the
american
surety
company
against
hinds
case
which
was
decided
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
that
case
is
an
all
force
was
the
case
before
this
court
today.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
--
certainly.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that
the
answer
--
the
thrust
is
that
those
persons
who
have
wages
within
the
connotation
of
bankruptcy
act
can
all
pay
in
particular
case.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
yes
sir.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
that's
right.
now
the
american
surety
company
case
against
--
american
surety
company
against
hinds
decided
in
the
tenth
circuit
was
a
situation
in
which
there
was
a
contract
with
the
united
states
government.
the
contractor
did
some
of
the
work
but
failed
to
finish.
accordingly,
the
trustee
went
ahead
and
actually
performed
the
work
and
finished
the
job.
the
surety
company,
one
of
the
moneys
that
had
been
retained
by
the
government
for
the
performance
of
the
contractor
up
until
the
time
that
he
failed
to
continue
in
his
performance
and
the
court
held
that
the
surety
would
have
to
fail.
the
surety
hadn't
established
its
right
to
priority.
it
had
all
the
cases
that
the
respondent
has
cited
in
this
matter
before
it,
a
large
number
of
which
were
court
of
claims
cases,
a
large
number
were
state
cases
applying
state
law.
and
in
fact,
the
court
and
the
tenth
circuit
stated
that
the
position
of
the
surety
in
a
matter
before
it
was
not
unsupported
by
authority.
but
on
the
basis
or
the
second
basis
set
forth
by
mr.
justice
jackson
it
held
against
the
surety
and
made
this
statement.
we're
not
convinced
however
of
the
merit
of
reason
which
limits
the
clear
holding
of
munsey
to
factual
situations
where
the
government
is
a
direct
claimant.
mr.
justice
jackson
speaking
for
the
court
notes
that
claim
with
the
surety
must
fail
for
two
reasons,
both
the
strength
of
the
government's
right
to
setoff
and
the
weakness
of
the
surety's
claim
to
equitable
rights
in
the
fund.
the
reasoning
of
the
opinion
in
a
latter
regard
is
in
no
way
dependent
upon
the
united
states
being
the
claimant.
now
we
have
one
other
case
that
we
rely
on
to
sustain
our
position,
that's
the
case
of
phoenix
indemnity
company
against
earle
which
was
decided
in
1955
in
the
ninth
circuit.
and
there,
the
united
states
government
tried
to
assert
certain
tax
liens
against
funds
which
had
come
into
the
hands
of
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
had
retained
these
funds
from
the
government
that
they
were
previously
been
retainages.
in
that
case
too,
the
surety
had
paid
the
laborers
and
materialmen,
but
the
court
held
that
the
government's
tax
liens
were
impressed
upon
the
moneys
received
by
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
and
stated
that
an
assertion
to
the
contrary
which
seems
to
have
been
laid
to
rest
by
the
munsey
case.
now
these
are
the
three
doc
--
cases
that
we
rely
upon
and
as
against
that,
the
surety
has
in
this
case
characterized
the
munsey
case
as
a
violent
doctrine
seeking
to
discredit
the
munsey
case
except
to
those
situations
where
the
government
is
a
party
and
seeking
to
discredit
these
two
cases
which
had
followed.
now
primarily
the
surety's
position
is
that
it
follows
the
cases
set
forth
as
the
prairie
state
national
bank
against
the
united
states
and
the
case
of
henningsen
against
the
united
states
fidelity
&
guaranty
company.
the
prairie
state
case
was
decided
in
1896.
we
have
no
argument
whatsoever
with
that
case.
it's
a
case
where
a
contractor
did
some
work
then
failed
to
complete
the
job,
the
surety
ran
and
completed
the
job.
so
the
surety
is
here
in
a
performance
rather
than
a
payment
situation.
in
that
particular
situation,
the
contractor
had
assigned
moneys
that
were
to
come
due
from
the
performance
of
the
contract
to
a
bank
and
the
contest
therefore
was
whether
the
assignee
bank
should
retain
the
retainages
or
whether
the
surety
should
succeed
and
the
court
held
that
the
surety
should
succeed.
now
we
think
that
that's
a
logical
case
and
we
point
out
why
it's
logical
and
why
a
contrary
result
would
be
illogical.
we
say
this
that
here
the
surety
has
come
in
and
actually
performed
and
the
first
thing
that
occurs
is
it's
perhaps
created
the
fund
which
it
subsequently
gets.
it
should
be
rewarded
by
the
creation
of
its
own
efforts.
the
second
thing
is
that
the
united
states
by
the
very
nature
things
can
be
forced
to
perform
upon
a
contractor.
that
the
united
states
has
a
million
dollar
contract
and
it
spends
$500,000
and
the
job
is
half
done,
and
the
contractor
defaults,
the
united
states
by
the
nature
of
things
might
be
forced
to
go
in
and
complete
the
contract,
to
complete
the
building,
to
protect
its
investments
and
the
time
and
the
money,
but
under
no
circumstances
can
the
united
states
of
america
be
forced
to
pay
the
materialmen
and
the
laborers.
so
as
i've
said
before,
we
have
no
argument
whatsoever
with
the
prairie
state
case,
but
then
the
next
case
which
is
cited
by
the
surety
is
henningsen
against
united
states
fidelity
&
guaranty,
decided
in
this
court
in
1908
and
it
again
seems
to
be
a
case
that
is
equally
cited,
but
this
is
an
entirely
different
case.
in
the
henningsen
case,
we
have
a
somewhat
similar
situation
in
that
the
contractor
assigned
the
moneys
to
be
earned
by
the
contractor
from
a
performance
of
the
government's
bond
to
a
bank.
the
contractor
did
some
of
the
work.
if
the
work
failed
to
pay
the
suppliers
and
the
materialmen
surety
stepped
in
paid.
now
the
strange
thing
here
is
that
the
surety
again
prevailed,
but
the
court
and
the
only
citation
contained
in
the
text
of
its
opinion
cited
the
prairie
state
case.
and
as
far
as
it
can
be
determined
by
the
opinion
itself,
it
made
no
distinction
between
payment
and
performance,
nevertheless
the
surety
prevailed
in
that
case.
the
court
stated
the
prairie
state
case
controlled.
there
is
no
reference
to
the
arguments
which
we
have
made
here
that
the
united
states
can
by
the
nature
of
things
be
forced
to
complete
a
contract
but
can
never
be
forced
to
pay,
then
proceeded
into
the
henningsen
case
and
made
the
statement
that
the
surety
was
obligated
to
pay
by
contract,
that
the
bank
was
a
volunteer.
well
to
me
that
which
did
not
seem
to
be
the
cheap
reason
in
the
case
is
to
point
out
a
different
situation
in
this
case
before
this
court,
we
point
out
that
we
represent
all
of
the
creditors,
some
of
whom
obtained
a
creditor
status
before
the
issuance
of
these
bonds
and
before
the
execution
of
this
contract
with
the
united
states
government.
and
we'd
hardly
think
that
they
qualify
as
volunteers
in
the
sense
that
the
court
used
that
phrase
in
the
henningsen
case.
however,
the
court
went
along
and
put
the
basis
for
the
recovery
by
the
surety
in
this
case
on
the
basis
that
the
surety
by
the
payment
of
laborers
and
materialmen
had
released
the
government
from
its
obligation
to
those
persons
and
to
the
same
extent
had
released
the
government
from
its
obligation
to
see
that
the
laborers
and
materialmen
were
paid.
so
that
at
this
stage,
we
now
come
into
the
cases
which
hold
that
the
surety
is
subrogated
to
the
position
because
of
its
satisfactions
of
the
government's
equitable
obligation
to
the
materialmen
and
the
laborers.
now
this
has
been
a
matter
which
has
been
criticized
over
the
course
of
time
and
various
law
journals
we've
been
citing
university
of
cincinnati
law
journal.
it's
been
criticized
in
yale
law
journal
which
was
published,
i
think,
in
the
later
part
of
the
summer
although
the
issue
itself
is
dated
as
recently
as
june
of
1962.
it
was
pointed
out
in
that
particular
article
that
what
the
court
seemed
to
be
saying
was
either
that
the
surety
had
a
claim
for
simple
reimbursement
from
the
government
as
a
secondary
principle
or
it
was
stating
that
the
satisfaction
of
the
government's
obligation
as
an
equitable
obligor
put
it
in
the
position
of
holding
the
retainages
which
the
government
had
at
the
time
of
dissatisfaction.
well
in
either
case
we
say
that
this
isn't
a
proper
subject
for
subrogation
because
we're
only
satisfying
what
is
an
equitable
obligation
and
not
a
legal
obligation.
and
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
at
this
time
that
in
the
henningsen
case
that
was
as
far
as
it
went
and
that
was
the
basis
of
the
recovery.
it
did
not
state
in
the
henningsen
case
that
the
laborers
and
materialmen
had
any
equitable
liens
or
equitable
priorities
as
against
the
retainages.
that
was
a
development
of
cases
which
followed.
now
the
cases
that
have
followed
have
not
explained
how
the
satisfaction
of
this
equitable
obligation
as
it's
described
in
henningsen
in
effect
creates
a
legal
right
in
the
surety.
the
belknap
case
is
probably
the
case
most
cited
by
attorneys
in
this
field.
belknap
case
was
decided
in
1921
and
that
case
attempted
to
spell
out
the
reasoning
of
the
henningsen
case
and
made
this
statement.
the
surety's
claim
of
prior
argument
with
the
fund
was
sustained
and
this
was
done
on
the
stated
theory
of
subrogation
since
it
cannot
be
the
transfer
of
a
right
by
subrogation
unless
there
is
a
right
to
be
transferred.
we
think
the
necessary
effect
of
the
decision
is
to
hold
that
the
laborers
and
materialmen
in
spite
of
or
in
addition
to
the
giving
of
the
bond
had
an
original
and
continuing
equitable
priority
to
the
bond
and
it
was
this
right
to
which
the
surety
was
subrogated.
so
now
we
have
an
evolution,
a
next
step
where
they
say
that
there
is
an
equitable
priority
to
which
the
surety
has
succeeded.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
no
sir.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
because
you
can't
have
a
lien
against
the
united
states
government.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
had
not
been
--
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
quite
right,
under
most
all
state
statutes
that's
true,
and
certainly
that
would
be
true
in
my
own
statement.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
that
maybe
the
background
of
it,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
government
has
here
done
something
more
than
would
be
the
case
what
a
private
individual
were
if
a
contract
was
done
in
new
york
state,
material
man
was
not
paid,
he
has
a
right
to
assert
a
mechanics
lien
against
the
property.
here
the
government
we
think
has
satisfied
this
equitable
obligation
by
the
payment
bonds.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
yes
sir.
now
what
we've
stated
here
is
that
the
government
is
asserted
by
the
court
to
be
in
a
certain
sort
of
ought
to
pay
situation,
that's
badly
said
but
that's
the
situation
as
we
see
it
and
we
say
does
that
create
a
right
to
payment
of
the
laborers
and
if
that's
the
position,
then
that
position
will
apply
in
the
face
of
all
the
cases
that
say
that
the
laborers
and
the
materialmen
have
no
rights
in
the
fund.
the
strange
thing
about
the
belknap
case
was
that
after
it
came
to
this
equitable
priority
theory,
and
it
had
noted
that
the
henningsen
case
that
favored
the
surety
on
the
basis
of
the
subrogation
theory,
the
belknap
case
then
described
its
subrogation
and
so
stated
in
the
opinion
itself,
and
made
these
rather
interesting
comments
which
i'd
like
to
read
to
the
court
but
which
one
follows
exactly
after
the
other
in
the
text
of
the
opinion.
the
belknap
case
goes
back
to
the
prairie
state
case
which
is
the
performance
bond
case
with
which
petitioner
in
this
matter
has
no
argument
whatsoever
and
referring
to
the
performance
bond
case
made
in
this
statement.
when
the
surety
in
the
later
case
stepped
in
the
united
states
was
the
obligee
in
an
unperformed
contract
holding
security
for
its
performance
and
the
surety
was
subrogated.
we
go
right
along,
then
the
next
sentence
refers
to
the
henningsen
case,
the
payment
bond
case
and
makes
this
statement.
when
henningsen
surety
paid
up,
the
united
states,
and
secured
creditors
had
been
satisfied
and
had
no
further
claim
of
the
fund
unless
it
was
the
duty
to
devote
the
fund
to
the
labor
and
material
claimants
and
hence
the
proposition
must
be
considered
as
established.
in
other
words,
belknap
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
there
had
to
be
this
equitable
priority
without
giving
a
basis
for
it
and
without
following
any
subrogation
theory
which
had
been
followed
in
the
henningsen
case
and
then
in
the
very
next
sentence
made
this
statement.
obviously
the
retained
fund
is
devoted
to
the
payment
for
such
labor
and
material
as
maybe
necessary
to
finish
the
work
after
the
contractor
defaults.
whether
it
is
devoted
to
pay
the
contractor's
debts
of
this
class
is
a
distinctive
question
and
the
cited
cases
suggest
to
us
confusion
of
thought.
in
other
words
when
you
quarrel
with
all
and
you
have
the
henningsen
case,
a
payment
bond
case
resulting
in
a
decision
favorable
to
the
surety
on
the
basis
of
subrogation
to
an
equitable
obligation
of
the
government.
in
the
belknap
case
the
surety
again
prevails
not
on
a
theory
subrogation,
but
on
a
new
theory
of
equitable
priority
comparable
to
an
equitable
lien.
and
we
say
that
it
can't
be
an
equitable
lien
because
it
doesn't
meet
any
of
the
elements
for
such
a
thing.
to
have
an
equitable
lien,
there
would
have
to
be
a
debtor
and
creditor
relationship.
there
is
no
debtor-creditor
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
materialmen.
the
second
thing
that
would
have
to
be
present
would
be
a
raise.
there
is
no
raise
because
the
funds
which
are
identified
as
retainages
are
only
so-called,
they
are
not
a
separate
identifiable
fund
but
rather
they
are
part
of
the
general
assets
of
the
united
states.
the
third
thing
has
been
no
act
of
appropriation
by
the
government
identifying
this
raise
as
set
aside
for
the
use
of
the
materialmen
and
the
laborers.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
session,
i
had
pointed
out
how
we,
representing
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
were
favored
by
three
decisions
of
recent
vintage
including
the
decision
of
this
court,
united
states
against
the
munsey
trust
company
decided
in
1947,
and
the
decisions
of
two
circuit
courts
which
clearly
favor
us.
one
of
the
being
an
all
force
with
the
case
before
your
honors.
i
had
also
pointed
out
that
time
that
the
surety
here
claimed
support
from
two
cases
of
this
court,
one
decided
1896,
the
prairie
state
national
bank
against
united
states
and
the
other,
the
case
of
henningsen
against
united
states
fidelity
and
guarantee
company
decided
in
1907.
i'll
repeat
what
i
said
yesterday
that
we
have
no
quarrel
whatsoever
with
the
case
of
prairie
state
against
national
bank.
i've
also
pointed
out
i
believe
that
there
is
an
attack
being
made
directly
here
on
the
henningsen
case.
now
we've
shown
how
the
courts
have
wandered
around
in
an
effort
to
sustain
the
results
which
have
favored
the
surety
in
these
cases
which
of
course
preceded
the
case
as
which
we
cite
are
supporting
us
since
1947.
now,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
might
be
interesting
to
look
to
the
position
of
the
government.
the
government,
under
the
standard
contract
that
it
had
in
this
case
and
it
has
in
all
of
these
types
of
cases,
has
a
provision
that
the
contracting
officer
is
under
no
obligation
to
see
that
the
laborers
and
the
materialmen
are
paid,
the
suppliers
and
the
materialmen
are
paid
where
50%
of
the
contract
has
been
performed.
we
think
that
this
is
indicative
of
the
fact
that
either
the
government
has
concluded
there
is
no
equitable
obligation
upon
the
government
to
see
that
they
are
paid
or
that
it
is
the
government's
thought
that
the
equitable
obligation
has
been
satisfied
by
the
passage
of
the
miller
act.
now,
it
might
also
be
of
some
interest
to
look
to
the
statements
made
in
the
congress
at
the
time
that
this
act
was
before
the
congress.
i
think
it's
clearly
stated
there
that
the
passage
of
the
miller
act
served
two
purposes.
the
performance
bond
was
to
satisfy
the
obligation
to
the
government
and
the
passage
of
the
provision
regarding
the
payment
bond
was
to
satisfy
any
obligation
or
any
duty,
call
it
what
you
will,
to
the
suppliers
and
the
materialmen.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
i
do
not
think
that
they
--
that
there
would
be
such
a
right.
i've
never
seen
a
statement
made
to
that
effect,
but
i
would
conclude
that
it
would
not
have
such
a
right
because
the
materialmen
have
no
enforceable
rights
directly
against
the
government.
it
would
almost
seem
that
if
they
were
doing
so,
it
was
in
the
nature
of
a
gift.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
government
--
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
oh,
you
mean
to
have
an
entirely
different
type
of
contract?
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
well,
it
would
be
an
entirely
different
con
--
contract.
the
contract
--
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
yes
sir,
the
contract
--
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
that's
right.
the
contract
runs
exclusively
to
the
contractor.
there
are
no
rights
included
to
the
materialmen
and
the
laborers.
it
would
have
to
be
an
entirely
different
thing
that
has
ever
been
done
before.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
it
says
nothing
about
it.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
that's
right.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
yes,
sir.
i
might
add
that
the
court
of
claims
is
presently
awaiting
the
decision
of
this
court
because
it
has
a
matter
before
it
in
which
this
--
which
this
matter
has
been
cited
and
it's
aware
of
the
fact
that
this
decision
is
up
for
consideration
for
the
members
of
this
court.
and
finally,
i
know
that
there's
been
a
great
deal
set
about
various
equities
here
and
we'd
like
to
point
out
the
fact
that
there
are
certain
equities
held
by
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
in
some
of
these
cases.
and
this
has
been
notably
apparent
in
the
fact
that
you
now
have
two
amicus
curiae,
who
represent
trustees
in
bankruptcy
who
are
presenting
briefs
to
this
court.
one
of
them
has
already
presented
a
brief
to
this
court
and
another
one
will
shortly
present
a
brief
to
this
court.
both
of
those
gentlemen
represent
trustees
in
bankruptcy
who
have
gone
ahead
and
performed
the
contract,
completed
the
contract
with
the
funds
of
the
bankrupt,
that
is
the
general
assets
of
the
bankrupt,
and
if
the
decision
of
this
court
is
that
under
the
circumstances
are
paid
for
by
the
surety,
if
the
surety
is
successful
then
i
take
it
that
the
trustees
in
bankruptcy
will
be
foreclosed
from
recovering
any
of
the
retainages
presently
held
by
the
government
in
those
particular
cases
and
will
have
the
anomalous
situation
that
the
trustee
who
did
the
work
did
not
recover
any
of
the
retainages,
but
the
surety
who
didn't
do
the
work
and
didn't
complete
the
job
did
recover
the
retainages.
thank
you.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
i
would
think
that
they
could
not
pay.
the
government
could
not
pay.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
that
is
right
but
as
i
--
but
as
i
pointed
out,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
it
is
not
a
separate
identifiable
fund
that's
part
of
the
general
assets
of
the
government.
it's
not
a
fund
that's
been
set
aside
and
appropriated.
and
in
addition,
the
government
would
then
be
in
a
position
that
it
would
be
paying
these
people
but
it
would
be
on
a
no
obligation
because
the
people
could
not
assert
any
kind
of
a
lien.
they
could
not
bring
any
kind
of
a
lawsuit
and
prevail.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
i
think
it's
an
effort
to
sustain
a
position
where
that
surety
recovered
and
the
first
time
that
i
saw
--
ever
sought
was
in
the
case
of
the
henningsen
case.
and
there,
the
court
seemingly
decided,
first,
how
it
wanted
to
decide.
that
is
that
the
surety
company
was
obligated
by
contract
and
then
set
but
the
assetee
bank
in
that
particular
case
was
a
mere
volunteer,
so
it
created
a
certain
equitable
appearance
on
behalf
of
the
surety.
and
then
apparently
in
an
effort
to
sustain
the
decision
which
seemingly
had
been
made
on
the
basis
of
the
voluntariness
or
the
lack
of
voluntariness
of
these
particular
parties
went
ahead
and
said
that
the
government
had
equitable
obligation
even
though
it
had
no
legal
obligation.
and
seemingly,
try
to
justify
its
reasoning
on
that
basis
and
it
was
subsequent
to
that
these
cases
seized
upon
the
equitable
obligation
theory.
but
clearly,
nobody
even
knows
that
it
said
that
the
government
actually
could
be
sued
or
would
--
could
be
made
to
pay
that.
mr.
raymond
t.
miles
with
an
ought-to-pay
situation,
they
ought
to
pay,
yes
sir.
