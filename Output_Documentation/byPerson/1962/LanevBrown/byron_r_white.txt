justice
byron
r.
white
the
basic
question
is
judged
in
a
couple
of
times
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
but
have
never
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
--
if
you
uphold
a
habeas
corpus
decision
in
the
federal
court,
i
guess
you
didn't
enunciate,
or
would
you
oppose
a
habeas
corpus
issue
in
the
federal
court
on
the
ground
that
he
had
not
exhausted
his
state
remedy?
justice
byron
r.
white
once
he
had
gone
through
the
trial
court
with
a
coram
nobis?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
there
grounds
alleged
in
the
petition
which
would
qualify
for
coram
nobis
under
indiana
law,
but
might
not
be
a
federal
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
there
are
grounds
alleged
in
the
petition
which
the
fed
--
which
it
would
do
him
no
good
whatsoever
to
go
into
federal
habeas
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
consequently,
people
who
couldn't
pay
for
lawyers
can
have
those
grounds
reviewed
in
the
indiana
courts
on
appeal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
whereas
ones
without
them
--
without
lawyers,
or
without
an
appeal
just
don't
have
those
grounds
reviewed.
the
trial
is
the
end
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
a
--
in
the
previous
argument,
you
noticed
that
if
you
have
a
lawyer,
it
would
be
a
substitute
for
a
transcript.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
was
only
--
if
there
was
only
a
federal
ground
alleged
in
the
petition,
you
really
would
have
no
particular
exception
of
this
whole
procedure,
would
you,
because
you
could
go
right
on
the
federal
habeas
after
the
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
give
up
one
chance
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right,
but
isn't
--
isn't
that
the
end
of
it
then?
doesn't
the
state
admit
then
that
state
remedies
are
exhausted
and
you
could
go
right
into
federal
habeas?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
what
the
state
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
i
asked
that
yesterday
of
the
state's
counsel
and
they
thought
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
in
this
case
[inaudible]?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
[inaudible]?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
were
the
added
post
to
that
[inaudible]
--
whether
or
not
what
the
grounds
were
in
a
coram
nobis
procedure
at
this
[inaudible]?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there's
a
real
question
[inaudible]
isn't
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
[inaudible]?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
confession
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
other
grounds?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
the
only
ground
is
what
you
considered
on
the
direct
appeal
and
this
ground
saying
that
you
have
[inaudible]
based
on
new
evidence
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
outside
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
it
raised?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
could
have
been.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
confession
in
evidence
that
he
alleged
was
--
was
demanded.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
did
answer
yesterday
that
your
position
is
that
it
has
been
in
this
case,
this
man
has
exhausted
his
state
remedies.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
also
went
a
little
farther
i
take
it,
and
said
that
the
indiana
--
the
rule
would
consider
an
indigent
to
have
exhausted
his
remedies
when
the
public
defender
refuses
to
represent
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
he
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
he
did
not
have
to
go
on
for
a
writ
of
mandate
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
certainly,
if
you
thought
the
[inaudible]
that
hearing
was
relevant,
you
won't
have
those
hearings
[inaudible]
