mr.
nathan
levy
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
nathan
levy
may
it
please
the
court.
i
knew
the
admission
of
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
indiana,
william
d.
ruckelshaus
and
i
think
a
(inaudible)
latin,
pro
hac
vice.
mr.
nathan
levy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
attention
has
been
called
to
the
case
of
indiana
cited
in
the
dissent,
i
believe,
in
betts
against
brady
which
was
an
1854
case,
and
which
contains
language
concerning
the
necessity
for
counsel.
it
is
a
language
from
the
indiana
supreme
court.
it
is
hardly
believable
to
me
that
a
hundred
years
later,
the
same
court
should
utter
an
opinion
such
as
it
was
written
in
the
mccrary
case
after
remand
of
that
case
to
it.
indeed,
i
would
hardly
have
expected
to
read
such
an
opinion
a
hundred
years
earlier.
mr.
nathan
levy
oh,
yes.
mr.
nathan
levy
counsel
at
trial.
mr.
nathan
levy
that
is
correct.
mr.
nathan
levy
this
is
not
questionable
based
on
the
macon
case
but
up
to
that
time
it
was
thought
to
be
the
ruling.
mr.
nathan
levy
this
man
(inaudible)
mr.
nathan
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
nathan
levy
that
is
correct.
mr.
nathan
levy
coram
nobis
proceedings.
mr.
nathan
levy
right.
and
at
that
point,
the
situation
of
this
case,
in
brown
situation,
became
precisely
the
same
as
the
situation
in
mr.
mccrary's
case
that
came
to
this
court.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
proper
place
for
us
to
begin.
there
is
one
or
two
difficulties
now
in
indiana
that
it
seems
to
me
ought
to
be
pointed
out
as
well.
for
the
willoughby
case,
apparently,
that's
something
to
change
the
rule
in
the
mccrary
case.
and
subsequent
to
the
willoughby
case,
there
was
the
macon
case
which
we
got
just
before
our
brief
went
off
to
be
printed
and
we
put
in
as
a
footnote
case.
since
that
time
and
since
our
arrival
here
in
washington,
we
understand
that
there
have
been
at
least
three
other
decisions
by
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
which
were
ordered
not
published
and
from
which
certiorari
has
been
asked
into
this
court,
all
of
which
apparently
affect
the
situation
of
indigents,
their
representation,
and
their
appeals
in
indiana.
we
are
not
prepared,
of
course,
to
speak
with
respect
to
these
later
cases
now
before
this
court
and
about
which
we
did
not
know
until
we
came
here.
the
attorney
general
is
bound
to
take
the
position
that
the
mccrary
case
fulfills
all
the
requirements
of
griffin
and
the
cases
following
it.
that
is
to
say,
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
whether
it'd
be
conceived
of
as
ground
to
the
--
in
due
process
or
grounded
in
the
equal
protection
clause.
there
seems
to
be
however,
a
colloquy,
an
argument
going
on
between
the
attorney
general,
between
his
adherence
and
reliance
upon
mccrary
and
the
adherence
and
reliance
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
on
a
chain
situation
in
willoughby,
which
of
it
becomes
important
i
will
go
into
it
later
on.
but
i
think
that
we
can
start
with
george
robert
brown's
case
at
the
same
place
that
we
can
start
with
mr.
mccrary
after
he
came
to
this
court.
he
came
to
this
court
and
this
court
reversed
or
set
aside
a
dismissal
of
his
action
and
remanded
the
case.
in
the
remand,
this
court
pointed
out
that
mr.
mccrary
had
made
certain
allegations
which
this
court
felt
that
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
may
not
have
education
to
look
into
in
light
of
the
griffin
case.
so
the
case
went
back
to
indiana
and
there
the
indiana
supreme
court
undertook
to
prepare
a
decision
on
that
case
on
the
remand.
this
court
indicated
that
mccrary's
allegations
were,
first,
that
he
could
not
get
a
transcript,
and
second
that
he
could
not
have
an
appeal
without
a
transcript,
and
that
he
could
not
receive
the
aid
of
the
public
defender,
and
therefore,
he
could
get
no
transcript,
and
that
he
was
indigent.
his
indigence
was
admitted.
now,
he
appears
--
his
case
appeared
before
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
on
remand.
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
first
says
that
the
griffin
case
does
not
apply
and
it
uses
distinctions
later
set
aside
by
this
court
in
the
smith
against
bennett
case.
so
that
those
distinctions,
it
seems
to
me,
are
no
longer
worthy
of
hearing
but
the
allegations
that
he
made
in
this
court
are
proved
to
be
the
truth.
he
said
in
this
court,
without
a
transcript,
he
could
have
no
appeal.
he
said
in
this
court
if
he
could
not
get
the
aid
of
the
public
defender,
he
could
not
get
the
transcript.
now
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
having
made
the
distinctions
of
which
i
have
mentioned,
having
indicated
that
griffin
against
illinois
was
not
applicable
then
proceeds
to
set
out
in
its
decision
the
precise
truth
of
the
allegations
that
mccrary
made
in
this
court.
first,
that
he
indicated
that
he
was
there
as
a
pro
se
appellant
subject
to
all
of
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
leaving
out
rule
26
with
respect
to
bill
of
exceptions
of
sticking
just
with
the
transcript,
says
that,
“you
must
have
a
transcript
and
this
is
a
formal
document
signed
by
the
court
below
or
by
the
clerk
below
in
vacation
time.
without
that,
you
are
not
here
in
this
court.
and
they
justified
the
conduct
of
the
public
defender
saying
that
he
must
not
give
a
transcript
to
anyone
he
does
not
represent.
and
it
was
shown
that
the
public
defender
decided
not
to
represent
mccrary.
now,
there's
--
there
is
this
hearing.
well,
this
affidavit
which
i
will
speak
in
a
moment
about
what
happened
to
mccrary
was
this;
he
was
not
really
in
court
at
the
time
that
case
was
being
considered
upon
remand.
he
was
standing
in
the
(inaudible)
some
place.
and
the
court
was
considering
whether
he
would
come
in,
and
they
said
the
papers,
not
the
appeal,
the
papers
that
you've
filed
do
not
fulfill
the
rules
and
you
are
out
of
this
court.
they
then
undertook
this
process
which
--
to
which
my
friend
from
indiana
has
referred.
they
issued
a
rule
to
show-cause
upon
the
public
defender.
he
files
an
affidavit
attaches
to
it
apparently,
the
affidavit
of
trial
counsel
in
the
original
trial
of
mccrary.
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
even
the
ethics
of
this
kind
of
an
affidavit.
this
kind
of
a
revelation
by
trial
counsel
without
at
least
mccrary's
permission
but
this
document
is
then
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
with
mccrary
still
securely
locked
away
in
the
state
prison,
same
kind
of
a
hearing
he's
had.
at
the
end
of
which
without
any
chance
on
mccrary's
part
--
mr.
nathan
levy
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
nathan
levy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
court's
recess
yesterday,
we
had
proceeded
with
the
respondent's
argument
to
the
point
of
examining
the
law
of
indiana
as
expressed
in
the
mccrary
case.
and
to
resume
that
argument,
i
would
like
first
simply
to
say
that
from
the
mccrary
case,
it
is
clearly
established
that
the
presence
of
a
transcript
is
necessary
to
an
appeal
in
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
and
by
transcript,
we
mean,
the
full
blown
transcript
in
its
formal
aspect.
it
is
also
established
in
the
law
of
indiana
by
the
mccrary
case
that
an
indigent
convicted
prisoner
goes
to
the
public
defender,
and
if
the
public
defender
refuses
to
accept
his
case,
refuses
to
represent
him,
that
prisoner
is
unable
to
obtain
a
transcript.
mr.
nathan
levy
to
the
extent
that
it
is
expressed
in
the
mccrary
case,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
levy
this
--
the
statute
refers
to
belated
appeals
and
apparently
could
be
broaden
to
include
the
direct
appeal
as
well.
mr.
nathan
levy
this
is
a
post
conviction
--
mr.
nathan
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
levy
i
would
say
that
it
is
an
absolute
right
taking
the
older
cases.
i
do
not
believe
the
question
has
been
raised
in
recent
years
at
least.
now,
from
the
mccrary
case,
it
may
also
be
gathered
that
there
is
some
form
of
review.
it
was
used
in
the
mccrary
case
and
then
after
the
brown
case
was
repeated
in
--
with
slight
changes
in
the
willoughby
case.
but
it
seems
to
us
unnecessary
to
examine
into
that
review
at
the
present
time
unless
the
court
desires
to
hear
upon
it
because
it
was
not
available
to
brown
and
he,
by
admission
of
the
state,
had
exhausted
all
state
remedies
available
to
him
prior
to
the
time
that
the
willoughby
case
was
decided.
now
when
we
turn
to
brown's
own
case,
we
have
a
slightly
different
treatment
both
by
this
court
and
by
the
court
below.
when
brown
first
sought
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
it
was
denied
him
on
the
ground
that
he
had
failed
to
exhaust
the
state
remedies.
then,
brown
proceeded
through
the
various
steps
that
mccrary
proceeded
through,
and
finally
came
before
this
court
with
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
upon
the
denial
by
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
of
a
writ
of
mandate
to
the
lake
criminal
court
to
provide
him
counsel
and
a
transcript
and
permit
him
to
appeal
from
the
denied
petition
for
writ
of
error
coram
nobis.
in
this
court,
instead
of
setting
aside
the
dismissal
of
his
action
and
remanding
as
had
been
done
in
the
mccrary
case,
the
court
denied
certiorari
without
prejudice
to
brown's
right
to
bring
habeas
corpus
in
the
appropriate
federal
district
court.
now
brown
did
go
into
the
federal
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
indiana
--
mr.
nathan
levy
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
the
great
problems
involved
in
this
case
is,
as
has
been
discussed
in
some
of
the
preceding
cases,
the
question
of
federalism
and
the
abrasive,
corrosive
relationship
with
respect
to
the
states.
the
procedures,
as
i
will
attempt
to
show
in
my
understanding
of
the
brown
case,
follow
precisely
the
recommendations
of
the
conference
of
chief
justices
with
respect
to
such
matters
in
the
use
of
federal
habeas
corpus.
so
that
when
brown's
case
was
in
the
federal
district
court
of
the
northern
district
of
indiana,
the
question
arose
as
to
whether
or
not
his
constitutional
rights
have
been
denied.
we
--
i
think
he
filed
on
july
19th,
1961.
we
were
assigned
to
represent
him
on
july
20th,
1961
and
in
the
interval
between
the
20th
and
the
26th,
when
the
order
of
the
district
court
was
entered,
two
hearings
were
held,
one,
the
original
hearing
and
then
at
the
request
of
the
state
of
indiana,
another
hearing.
now
the
federal
district
judge,
having
heard
the
case,
wrote
an
opinion
which
is
a
part
of
the
transcript,
finding
that
brown
had
been
denied
his
constitutional
rights.
and
the
federal
district
judge,
following
the
recommendations
and
rules
of
this
court,
as
established
in
an
earlier
indiana
case
by
chance,
granted
the
state
of
indiana
time
in
which
to
correct
the
defect
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
rights
of
george
robert
brown.
mr.
nathan
levy
no,
your
honor,
it
was
cook
against
dowd,
another
similar
case
in
which
this
court
--
cook's
papers
were
destroyed
each
time
that
he
prepared
them
and
they
were
never
sent
up
to
the
court.
and
when
the
court
decided
that
his
rights
have
been
taken
away
from
him,
this
court
directed
the
federal
district
court
from
the
northern
district
of
indiana,
south
bend
division,
another
judge
city,
to
give
the
state
of
indiana
some
time
in
which
to
permit
him
to
have
his
appeal
rather
than
to
release
him
at
once,
so
that
the
federal
district
court
below
in
the
brown
case
followed
very
meticulously
this
rule,
granted
90
days
to
the
state
of
indiana
to
attempt
to
correct
this
constitutional
defect,
the
deprivation
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
george
robert
brown.
i
must
also
call
the
court's
attention
that
in
the
order,
the
court
below
indicated
that
additional
time
would
be
granted
if
desired
by
the
state
of
indiana.
thus
--
mr.
nathan
levy
no,
sir.
no,
i
am
trying
to
indicate
that
in
every
respect
of
the
--
in
the
case
of
george
robert
brown,
all
that
it
can
possibly
be
done
with
respect
to
the
relationship
of
this
court
and
the
state
judiciaries
--
the
state
judiciary
of
indiana
has
been
done.
mr.
nathan
levy
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
nathan
levy
the
--
yes,
i
believe
that
in
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
the
original
one
having
been
granted
by
what
is
known
at
the
prison
as
the
writ
department,
the
grounds
are
stated.
mr.
nathan
levy
yes,
the
writ
department
of
the
indiana
state
prison.
mr.
nathan
levy
--
is
a
--
it's
a
sort
of
a
--
what
the
--
justice
schaefer
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
once
called
it
the
prison
therapy
department.
there
are
no
lawyers
in
the
writ
department,
but
they
draft
all
these
petitions
and
papers
and
they
--
they
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
levy
the
statement
of
them
appears
in
the
transcript
of
record
beginning
at
page
20
and
is
a
very,
very
long
statement,
as
is
true
of
the
writ
department,
that
he
was
denied
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
because
the
appointed
attorney
neglected
to
enforce
his
constitutional
rights
and
--
mr.
nathan
levy
there
was
a
question
of
a
confession
involved
in
the
case,
that
the
confession
was
improperly
admitted
--
mr.
nathan
levy
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
be
fully
frank,
we
felt
at
the
time
that
we
were
assigned
and
having
examined
what
record
we
could
that
the
--
that
the
denial
of
what
we
argued
then
was
equal
protection
of
the
law
whether
it
is
equal
protection
or
due
process
is
a
different
question,
was
so
startling
an
error
and
so
complete
the
deprivation
of
the
rights
of
this
man
as
measured
by
the
griffin
case
and
the
ones
following
that
there
was
little
need
to
go
into
any
other
of
the
questions
raised.
and
it
was
--
the
other
questions
are
--
mr.
nathan
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
nathan
levy
yes,
your
honor.
well,
it
is
our
feeling
that
this
constitutional
right
follows
him
both
in
the
trial
stage
and
the
direct
appeal
and
in
any
post
convictional
appeal.
and
if
denied
and
the
denial
persisted
against
the
opportunity
to
correct,
he
must
be
given
the
benefit,
the
advantage
of
that
constitutional
right
as
well
as
any
other
person.
mr.
nathan
levy
yes,
i
--
i
--
i'm
convinced
that
there
are
your
honor,
in
the
--
through
the
length
of
the
--
mr.
nathan
levy
yes.
that
is
true.
mr.
nathan
levy
that's
correct.
mr.
nathan
levy
mr.
justice
white,
we
--
we
thought
of
arguing
the
question
of
lack
of
counsel
and
in
our
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals,
we
mentioned
the
point,
but
we
did
not
argue
it
in
our
oral
argument
there.
the
problem
of
arguing
counsel
in
our
case
is
extremely
peculiar.
what
good
would
counsel
do
him
without
the
transcript?
the
transcript
is
the
key
to
the
appeal.
mr.
nathan
levy
not
in
indiana,
not
in
the
face
of
the
--
of
the
clear
cut
statement
of
rule
in
the
mccrary
as
repeated
in
willoughby.
there
is
--
we
actually
felt
that
we
should
argue
the
question
of
counsel
particularly
when
this
case
was
set
on
the
calendar
following
the
other
three.
mr.
nathan
levy
yes.
it
is
a
slightly
--
a
slightly
different
towards
that
you
are
expressing
sir,
but
--
mr.
nathan
levy
yes.
we
have
the
feeling
that
what
brown
was
asked
to
go
back
to
indiana
to
do,
to
exhaust
state
remedies
was
itself
wrong.
there
are
no
state
remedies
in
indiana.
mr.
nathan
levy
once
the
public
defender
has
said,
“i
will
not
give
you
a
transcript
--”
mr.
nathan
levy
i'm
not
sure
that
the
state
will
admit
that.
mr.
nathan
levy
i'm
not
sure
that
the
--
that
the
state
of
indiana
will
admit
that.
what
mccrary
was
put
through
and
what
brown
was
put
through
was
--
mr.
nathan
levy
we
thought
that
--
that
state's
counsel
had
gone
further
in
response
to
your
question
than
the
state
had
gone
in
any
other
time
in
our
working
in
this
case,
but
i
--
i
do
not
believe
it
could
be
so.
mr.
nathan
levy
that
is
correct,
but
nevertheless
in
each
of
the
instances,
the
convicted
criminal
appearing
pro
se
went
through
the
effort
in
the
trial
court
which
denied
the
petition
for
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
to
get
counsel
and
transcript
upon
the
--
upon
refusal
attempted
by
writ
of
mandate
in
the
supreme
court
to
get
counsel
and
transcript
by
mandate
to
that
court.
i
do
not
believe
that
those
can
be
classified
as
state
remedies
available.
they
represent
lawyers
or
writ
department's
efforts
to
find
remedies.
they
are
not
established
as
remedies.
mr.
nathan
levy
we
believe
that
they
have
been
exhausted.
mr.
nathan
levy
no,
and
under
those
circumstances
where
there
are
only
federal
questions
to
be
raised,
we
would
not
be,
but
the
questions
raised
are
a
mass
of
problems.
the
one
question
that
we
believe
stands
out
above
all
others
is
the
question
of
the
denial
of
his
constitutional
rights.
now,
it
seems
so
clear,
so
obvious,
that
the
state
of
indiana,
under
the
system
and
i
will
discuss
the
actual
system
itself
(inaudible)
--
mr.
nathan
levy
that's
correct.
yes
--
mr.
nathan
levy
yes,
and
(voice
overlap)
--
they
have
been
reviewed
on
direct
appeal
and
the
conviction
was
sustained.
now
--
mr.
nathan
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
nathan
levy
denied.
mr.
nathan
levy
that
is
correct.
now
indiana
has
created
a
post
--
mr.
nathan
levy
they
are
res
judicata
but
coram
nobis,
if
the
allegations
with
respect
to
petition
--
mr.
nathan
levy
yes.
at
least
you
can
raise
in
coram
nobis
in
indiana
which
is
somewhat
like
a
state
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
those
questions
that
--
of
which
the
convicted
prisoner
can
say,
“had
you
known
this
at
that
time
you
would
not
have
convicted
me”
and
this
could
be
any
kind
of
a
question
--
mr.
nathan
levy
yes,
i
would
say
that
this
is
--
this
is
the
rule,
this
is
a
court
interpreted
rule.
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
--
mr.
nathan
levy
i
cannot
answer
that,
your
honor,
because
we
have
not
seen
the
transcript,
we
have
not
seen
the
record.
there
is
no
way
for
us
to
know.
mr.
nathan
levy
yes.
mr.
nathan
levy
yes.
mr.
nathan
levy
well,
if
you
gather
from
that,
then
the
allegations
at
least
contain
other
grounds.
the
--
mr.
nathan
levy
that
is
correct.
mr.
nathan
levy
that
--
mr.
nathan
levy
has
the
record,
can
respond
to
the
questions
and
can
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
and
yet
its
judgment
expressed
upon
even
the
very
question
that
has
been
proposed
to
me
by
the
court.
mr.
nathan
levy
well,
i
can
--
i
will
address
myself
to
that
right
now
because
this
is
the
situation
as
we
have
it.
we
have
sort
of
three
categories
of
people.
we
have
non-indigents
who
can
afford
their
transcripts.
we
have
indigents
who
receive
the
assistance
of
the
public
defender
which
means
representation
and
transcript.
and
then
we
have
the
category
into
which
george
robert
brown
falls,
an
indigent
convicted
prisoner
whom
the
public
defender
refuses
to
represent
and
who
therefore
cannot
have
his
transcript,
and
therefore
cannot
have
any
kind
of
review.
mr.
nathan
levy
that
is
correct.
mr.
nathan
levy
oh
yes.
mr.
nathan
levy
has
the
transcript.
mr.
nathan
levy
agree,
yes.
mr.
nathan
levy
that
is
correct.
mr.
nathan
levy
yes.
the
--
the
supreme
court
in
the
mccrary
case
says
specifically
that
without
the
transcript,
it
has
no
jurisdiction.
the
transcript
is
jurisdictional
to
it.
mr.
nathan
levy
that
could
be
but
--
mr.
nathan
levy
mr.
justice
white,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
regardless
of
what
the
coram
nobis
record
would
show,
that
is
a
matter
for
the
state
and
the
state's
jurisdiction.
that
should
not
be
a
matter
tried
or
heard
in
the
federal
court.
he
was
denied
his
constitutional
rights
the
moment
he
was
denied
the
right
to
appeal.
that
happens
in
indiana
to
take
the
form
of
the
denial
of
the
transcript.
mr.
nathan
levy
it
could
be
that
they
were
foreclosed,
and
possibly
they
were
not
foreclosed
but
the
question
of
whether
--
mr.
nathan
levy
you
can't
tell
unless
you
have
the
record
and
the
question
of
whether
they
are
or
are
not
foreclosed
is
a
question
that
should
be
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
and
not
by
a
court
in
the
federal
judicial
system.
mr.
nathan
levy
your
honor,
it
makes
the
test
the
most
difficult
single
kind
of
case.
may
i
respond
to
that
by
saying
this?
indiana
tests
this
kind
of
a
problem
with
respect
to
the
non-indigent
prisoner
by
having
his
transcript
go
into
the
supreme
court
and
having
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
say,
“you
are
simply
re-alleging
the
very
same
things
that
we
have
examined
before
and
there's
nothing
new
in
it,”
we
deny
this
appeal.
now
the
--
mr.
nathan
levy
the
indigent
certainly
has
no
right
to
compel
the
state
to
pour
its
money
down
the
sewer,
but
the
state,
as
a
matter
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
or
due
process
which
are
--
however
you
wish
to
think
about
it
that
the
cases
say
equal
protection
of
the
law,
certainly
does
not
have
the
right
to
say,
and
this
is
in
response
to
your
question,
sir,
and
the
question
of
mr.
justice
goldberg
as
well.
here
is
a
lawyer
available
to
you,
our
indigent
friend,
who's
called
the
public
defender,
you
go
to
him.
the
public
defender
sees
this
man,
listens
to
his
tale,
examines
what
he
can
of
the
record
and
of
his
own
notes
in
this
instance
of
what
occurred
in
the
court
and
says
to
him,
“there
is
no
merit
in
your
case.”
now
the
state
of
indiana
has
sent
the
prisoner
to
the
public
defender
as
lawyer
and
then
by
interpretation
and
rule
of
law,
the
man
who
has
visited
the
public
defender
as
lawyer
suddenly
finds
out
this
was
the
judge,
this
was
the
man
who
decided
this
case.
he
went
to
him
for
assistance
as
a
lawyer
and
that
man,
by
the
interpretation
of
the
laws
of
indiana,
is
given
the
power,
the
equivalent
power
of
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
mr.
nathan
levy
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
--
i
can
only
speculate
in
this
way.
to
me,
it
would
seem
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
nathan
levy
in
--
earlier,
in
one
of
the
cases
that
you
your
honor
asked,
a
similar
question.
under
the
peculiar
situation
in
indiana,
he
has
an
absolute
right
to
get
a
transcript
because
that's
jurisdictional
to
anything
that
he
gets.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
language
of
griffin
or
the
succeeding
cases
which
say
that
a
state
is
free
to
workout
other
methods
is
meaningless
language.
the
state
of
indiana
maybe
able
to
workout
other
methods
so
that
instead
of
the
formal
document
called
a
complete
transcript,
what
your
honor
referred
to
as
a
bystander's
transcript,
something
of
that
kind
could
be
used,
but
where
the
state
itself
says,
“you
must
either
have
this
document
or
we
have
no
jurisdiction,”
how
else
can
the
indigent
react?
how
else
can
the
constitution
protect
the
indigent?
there
must
be
--
mr.
nathan
levy
well,
you
--
the
state
has
established
a
public
defender
and
this,
i
think
is
an
answer
now
to
questions
asked
by
a
number
of
the
members
of
the
court,
has
established
a
public
defender.
he
is
a
lawyer.
he
acts
as
lawyer
to
the
indigent.
with
respect
to
the
questions
of
lack
of
merit
in
the
appeal
of
a
non
--
of
an
indigent
person,
his
judgment
is
accepted
as
infallible.
that
ends
the
rights
of
the
non-indigent
--
of
the
indigent
person
in
indiana.
well,
this
is
quite
of
a
responsibility
for
a
lawyer.
this
is
outside
the
province
of
a
lawyer
and
there
can
be
differences
of
opinion
among
lawyers.
as
mr.
justice
stewart
indicated
in
an
earlier
case,
the
non-indigent
might
try
a
thousand
different
ways
until
he
found
one
who
believed
he
had
a
point
by
which
he
could
appeal.
now,
let
us
look
at
the
public
defender
the
other
way.
the
public
defender
in
none
--
in
cases
in
which
he
finds
a
lack
of
merit
has
the
final
word,
but
when
he
thinks
there
is
merit,
the
state
of
indiana
itself
does
not
give
him
the
final
word.
when
he
finds
there
is
merit,
he
becomes
just
another
lawyer
like
the
rest
of
us
who
provides
the
transcript
and
takes
that
question
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
mr.
nathan
levy
if
the
non-indigent
--
mr.
nathan
levy
yes
sir,
your
honor.
if
the
non-indigent
--
mr.
nathan
levy
it
would
seem
to
me,
your
honor,
that
--
that
the
state
would
have
a
right
to
protect
itself.
for
example,
if
they
were
to
say,
“it
is
unnecessary
to
bring
out
the
full
transcript,”
you
can
use
the
narrative
statement.
there
are
--
mr.
nathan
levy
no,
sir.
mr.
nathan
levy
under
those
circumstances,
my
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
they
must
provide
--
mr.
nathan
levy
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that's
true.
it
may
--
makes
his
own
condition.
mr.
nathan
levy
yes.
mr.
nathan
levy
yes.
well,
the
--
as
long
as
indiana
makes
the
full
transcript,
the
only
way
to
open
the
door
to
the
supreme
court,
you
have
one
question.
if
the
state
of
indiana
would
create
a
system
by
which
frivolous
appeals
of,
let
me
say
the
indigent
and
non-indigent
both
could
be
sifted
and
looked
into
so
that
they
were
all
treated
alike
and
the
transcript
were
not
the
--
the
one
key
for
opening
the
door
to
the
supreme
court
a
thousand,
maybe
a
hundred
thousand
different
possible
combinations
would
be
open.
but
in
response
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
the
state
of
indiana
in
this
case,
its
requirements
with
respect
to
the
transcript,
there
seems
to
us
no
way
out
except
to
say,
the
indigent
must
be
given
the
transcript
and
the
public
expense.
mr.
nathan
levy
no,
if
that
system
were
made
available
and
may
i
add
some
--
one
other
thing
to
it,
enough
of
the
record
itself,
not
an
affidavit
or
so
--
mr.
nathan
levy
could
tell.
mr.
nathan
levy
this
would
seem
to
be
--
mr.
nathan
levy
that's
correct.
to
put
it
in
this
way,
we,
in
order
to
uphold
the
indiana
system,
we
must
say
that
the
judgment
and
the
opinion
of
the
public
defender
is
the
constitutional
equivalent
of
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
highest
court
in
the
state.
mr.
nathan
levy
if
it
were
applicable
to
a
rich
and
poor
alike
and
had
to
do
with
an
appeal
which
the
state
could
or
create
upon
any
terms
that
it
wished,
that
would
a
be
constitutional
procedure.
mr.
nathan
levy
that's
correct,
we
couldn't
be
here.
mr.
nathan
levy
now,
i
would
like
to
indicate
just
one
more
thing.
the
defect
in
the
state
of
indiana,
the
crux
of
the
problem
is
this
transcript.
we
wanted
to
argue
the
counsel
question.
i
would
hate
to
have
to
be
without
counsel
on
appeal
in
indiana,
as
with
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
words
that
the
court
has
heard
concerning
counsel
at
the
trial
level
and
believing
them
all,
and
coming
from
the
state
which
branches
attorneys
at
the
trial
level,
if
i
were
accused
of
crime
and
were
not
a
lawyer
but
could
remember
what
i'd
known
as
being
a
lawyer
and
had
to
choose
in
indiana
between
having
counsel
at
the
trial
or
counsel
for
an
appeal,
i
would
choose
to
have
counsel
on
the
appeal.
mr.
nathan
levy
well,
that
is
correct
but
the
odds
it
seems
to
me
that
chances
are
greater
in
indiana,
that
you
would
need
the
assistance
of
the
attorney
on
--
at
the
appeal
level
than
you
would
at
the
trial
level.
and
in
this
case,
we
have
a
writ
department
at
the
prison
that
turns
out
these
papers
and
if
you
examine
the
transcript,
you
have
seen
some
of
the
work
that
they
do,
but
there
are
policies
in
some
prisons
that
do
not
permit
this.
there
are
prisons
where
the
prisoners
have
a
higher
degree
of
illiteracy,
less
sophistication
and
if
this
kind
of
a
situation
can
exist
in
the
state
of
indiana,
the
--
the
equivalent
in
other
states
is
at
least
as
great
and
possibly
worst.
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
time
--
the
time
has
come
to
enunciate
some
kind
of
a
rule
that
will
prevent
this
kind
of
a
situation
as
rules
in
the
case
of
george
robert
brown
or
in
the
case
of
mccrary.
mr.
nathan
levy
there
was
a
hearing,
your
honor,
of
--
mr.
nathan
levy
i
do
not
--
there
was
a
hearing
and
it
was
denied.
i
--
george
robert
brown
was
not
present
in
--
mr.
nathan
levy
the
public
defender.
mr.
nathan
levy
he
was
represented
at
that
trial
and
the
--
the
public
defender
--
we
cannot
furnish
any
statistical
data,
neither
the
state
nor
the
respondent's
counsel,
concerning
the
number
of
cases
that
the
public
defender
handles
of
any
--
finds
have
merit
on
any
--
he
finds
do
not
have
merit
because
of
the
small
staff
and
small
office
staff
that
he's
unable
to
keep
records
and
statistics
and
so
reported
to
us.
mr.
nathan
levy
he
is
entitled
to
be
released,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
levy
yes,
he
can
be
held
and
retried
on
this
charge
or
he
can
be
arrested
at
the
gate
and
an
article
in
the
newspaper
one
the
portions
of
the
state
indicated
that
he
would
be
arrested
at
the
gate,
but
with
respect
to
this
first
--
this
present
situation,
he
is
entitled
to
be
released.
mr.
nathan
levy
if
--
if
we
are
--
if
we
are
right,
he
has
been
denied
the
right
of
appeal
from
his
denied
petition
for
writ
of
coram
nobis.
mr.
nathan
levy
there
is
no
way
that
he
can
have
that
appeal.
mr.
nathan
levy
may
i
say
this
with
respect
to
that.
the
district
court
below
indicated
that
the
responsibility
of
indiana
was
to
provide
george
robert
brown
with
the
full
appellate
review
from
the
denial
of
his
petition
for
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
--
mr.
nathan
levy
--
that
the
non-indigent
prisoner
was
entitled
to
get.
the
state
of
indiana
had
90
days
and
as
much
additional
time
was
--
would
be
wanted,
they
did
not
ask
for
them,
90
days
in
which
to
do
that.
now,
this
denial
is
the
denial
of
a
constitutional
right.
we
are
concerned
about
that
and
i
am
sure,
as
has
been
indicated
in
arguments
on
the
other
cases,
with
the
improper
withholding
of
constitutional
rights
and
in
the
doing
of
that,
improperly
depriving
a
person
of
life
and
liberty.
he
has
--
he
has
been
a
resident
of
death
row
for
a
long
time.
and
in
every
respect,
the
right
of
the
state,
the
opportunity
for
the
state
to
give
him
this
full
review
has
been
protected
and
held
out
and
offered.
the
state
of
indiana
has
of
its
own
volition,
determined
it
would
not
do
so.
time
is
--
has
been
long
and
it
has
run
a
long
time.
mr.
nathan
levy
well,
if
--
i
have
not
gone
into
this.
i
am
--
some
--
in
some
instances,
it
is
held
that
one
who
receives
his
freedom
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
not
permitted
to
plea
double
jeopardy.
i
don't
--
the
state
has
given
no
indication
of
that,
but
an
article
appeared
in
one
of
the
newspapers
stating
that
the
state
was
ready
upon
the
moment
of
release
to
arrest
him
on
another
crime
and
i
am
advised
that
at
the
time
he
appeared
once
in
the
court,
the
federal
district
court
at
our
first
argument,
the
sheriff
was
present
with
a
warrant
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
levy
the
conviction
(inaudible)
--
mr.
nathan
levy
under
those
--
mr.
nathan
levy
under
those
circumstances,
i
would
agree
that
he
could
not
be
retried,
but
this
would
not
change
the
position
that
he
must
be
released.
may
i
say
this?
mr.
nathan
levy
if
--
yes.
mr.
nathan
levy
he
was
--
well,
he
was
convicted
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
levy
yes,
he
would
do
(inaudible)
--
in
this
case
of
murder
and
a
perpetuation
of
a
robbery
which
resulted
in
the
death
of
a
woman
and
i
think
[inaudible]
mr.
nathan
levy
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
nathan
levy
he's
under
the
death
sentence.
mr.
nathan
levy
the
--
i
am
told
that
his
--
that
his
confession
includes
the
confession
of
another
murder.
mr.
nathan
levy
well,
the
--
the
state
of
indiana
--
let
me
start
out
by
saying
--
by
quoting
lord
seldon's
general
approach
to
the
problem.
lord
seldon
said,
“with
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
we
deliberately
take
a
social
risk
that
there
will
be
a
few
extra
slashed
throats”,
and
he
used
those
words.
this
is
not
a
proceeding
to
measure
the
worth
of
george
robert
brown.
this
is
a
proceeding
to
measure
the
worth
of
a
constitutional
protection.
the
state
of
indiana
has
held
him
in
prison
after
having
had
full
opportunity
to
offer
him
what
the
justices
now
indicate,
and
once
again
would
be
indicated
to
indiana.
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
started
to
describe
the
procedure
with
respect
to
the
george
robert
brown
case
so
carefully
was
that
we
--
that
the
federal
courts
in
this
instance
have
the
final
responsibility
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
question
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
the
federal
courts
in
this
instance
have
followed
out
every
possible
suggestion
with
respect
to
the
maintenance
of
good
relations
with
the
state
judicial
system.
the
court
followed
the
recommendations
of
the
conference
of
chief
justices.
the
lower
court
did
precisely
what
is
now
suggested
shall
be
done.
now
if
the
constitutional
right
has
a
real
value
despite
the
danger
to
the
--
to
individuals
in
our
society,
how
long
they
may
had
--
be
withheld.
mr.
nathan
levy
oh,
yes
but
in
addition
to
--
mr.
nathan
levy
in
addition
to
the
right
not
to
have
to
go
to
the
electric
chair,
the
constitution,
under
these
circumstances,
would
restore
him
his
liberty.
mr.
nathan
levy
none
at
all.
mr.
nathan
levy
no.
mr.
nathan
levy
well,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
argument
on
that
point
was
one
that
i
indicated
in
the
last
sentence
of
my
brief
in
opposition
and
i
doubt
seriously,
the
court
would
wish
made
now.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
very
strong
case
can
be
made
out,
that
the
position
of
the
state
of
indiana
with
respect
to
this
case
and
its
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
its
seeking
certiorari
here
was
as
frivolous
as
anything,
that
it
is
charged
the
indigent
prisoners
with
--
back
in
the
state
of
indiana.
mr.
nathan
levy
that
is
correct.
mr.
nathan
levy
it
was
a
matter
of
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
and
that
--
mr.
nathan
levy
well,
the
--
there
is
some
doubt
in
indiana,
but
there
is
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
that
they
can
change
their
rules
by
their
own
force
and
power
and
when
you
read
the
mccrary
case,
the
rule
240
which
also
appears
in
our
brief
is
the
rule
which
--
which
requires
the
transcript.
and
the
mccrary
case
says
that
in
just
so
many
words,
that
transcript
is
jurisdictional.
we
felt
that
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
would
vary
at
the
time
that
the
district
court
entered
its
order.
mr.
nathan
levy
i
don't
know
what
they
would
--
what
they
could
do.
we
feel
this.
we
feel
that
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
has
the
power
if
it
wished
to
order
a
transcript
brought
to
it
and
to
review
in
the
case
of
this
kind,
and
i
believe
that
the
district
court
gave
the
90-day
period
and
indicated
a
longer
time
if
necessary
feeling
that
the
court
would
do
that.
mr.
nathan
levy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
levy
thank
you.
