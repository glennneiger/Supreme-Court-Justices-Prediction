justice
william
o.
douglas
in
that
connection,
on
page
21
of
your
brief,
you
cite
the
mccrary
case,
the
willoughby
case,
and
the
--
and
this
case
on
the
petition
for
a
mandate.
the
(inaudible)
--
to
review
the
decision
of
the
public
defender
not
to
proceed
and
you
cite
those
cases
from
the
point
that
the
decision
of
the
public
defender
not
to
proceed,
or
in
other
words,
his
decision
at
the
appeal
would
be
--
present
frivolous
matter
is
reviewable.
and
my
question
is,
reading
those
three
decisions
indicates
that
technically
your
statement
is
correct
but
actually
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
affords
its
own
relief,
does
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
has
it
ever
--
has
it
ever
reversed
the
public
defender?
has
it
ever
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
appointed
a
new
public
defender?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
as
i
read
those
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
those
opinions,
the
opinions
read
as
if
the
discretion
of
the
public
defender
is
non-reviewable
actually,
i
mean
they
entertain
the
petition;
they
write
an
opinion
and
say
petition
denied.
