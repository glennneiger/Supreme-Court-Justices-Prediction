mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
express
my
appreciation
at
the
court
allowing
me
to
appear
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
indiana
in
this
case.
this
case
involves
somewhat
the
same
consideration
as
were
involved
in
the
previous
case
and
to
put
those
into
a
factual
context,
i
will
give
a
brief
statement
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
george
robert
brown,
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
and
was
an
indigent.
he
was
convicted
in
the
lake
county
criminal
court
in
lake
county,
indiana
of
murder
in
the
perpetration
of
a
robbery
in
december,
1957.
he
was
sentenced
to
die
on
the
electric
chair.
this
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
in
december
1958.
george
robert
brown
was
provided
with
counsel
and
with
a
transcript
on
that
appeal
as
all
indigents
are
in
indiana
on
appeal
from
the
original
conviction.
he
filed
certiorari
in
this
court
and
it
was
denied
in
march,
1959
without
prejudice
to
his
right
to
file
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
he
then
filed
his
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
of
the
northern
district
of
indiana.
this
writ
was
denied
in
february,
1964
his
failure
to
exhaust
state
remedy.
he
then
in
went
--
went
back
into
the
state
court
in
lake
county,
indiana
in
the
criminal
court
and
filed
a
writ
of
error
coram
nobis.
this
was
in
may
of
1960.
in
this
writ
of
error
coram
nobis,
he
alleged
that
several
deprivations
of
constitutional
right
and
other
rights,
the
main
contention
that
he
alleged
whether
he
was
--
his
confession
was
coerced
and
that
he
was
inadequately
represented
by
counsel
at
his
trial.
the
public
defender
in
indiana
represented
the
george
robert
brown
at
this
hearing.
in
june
1960,
the
lake
county
criminal
court
denied
his
petition
for
writ
of
coram
nobis.
he
then
sought
by
a
writ
of
mandate
in
that
court
or
prior
to
that
he
asked
the
public
defender
to
represent
him
on
an
appeal.
the
public
defender
in
a
letter
sent
to
george
robert
brown
and
reprinted
in
the
record
on
pages
40
and
41,
said
that
he
could
find
no
merit
on
his
appeal
and
therefore
had
it
declined
to
represent
him
in
this
appeal.
george
robert
brown
then
filed
a
petition
for
mandate
in
the
lake
county
criminal
court
seeking
to
have
that
court
appoint
him
counsel
and
also
to
provide
him
with
the
record
for
appeal.
this
petition
was
denied.
he
then
saw
the
petition
for
writ
of
mandate
in
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
seeking
the
same
thing,
in
other
words
to
have
a
counsel
appointed
and
also
to
have
a
transcript
provided
so
that
he
might
perfect
an
appeal.
this
petition
was
denied
by
the
indiana
supreme
court.
he
again
saw
the
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
court
which
again
was
denied
in
february,
1960
or
in
june,
1961,
and
again
without
prejudice
to
his
right
to
bring
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
he
filed
the
--
another
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
indiana
on
june
--
this
was
on
july,
in
july
of
1961.
on
july
26th,
the
judge
of
the
district
court
of
the
northern
district
of
indiana
ordered
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
to
grant
george
robert
brown
an
appeal
from
his
denial
of
his
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
on
the
grounds
that
he
had
been
denied
equal
protection.
this
order
gave
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
90
days.
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
took
no
action
on
this
case
and
in
november
of
1961
a
show-cause
order
was
issued
to
the
state
of
indiana
as
to
why
george
robert
brown
should
not
be
released.
after
hearing
on
the
show-cause
order,
he
was
ordered
release
but
remanded
back
to
the
custody
of
the
warden
of
state
prison
pending
his
appeal
to
pending
the
appeal
of
the
state
to
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
now
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals,
last
may,
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
district
court
of
the
northern
district
of
indiana.
it
is
from
this
affirmance
that
the
state
has
sought
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit
and
it
was
granted
by
this
court
last
october.
as
i
have
said
before,
george
robert
brown
is
an
indigent.
it
is
conceded
by
the
state
that
before
he
can
appeal
in
a
belated
proceeding
such
as
the
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
or
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
he
must
seek
the
aid
of
the
public
defender.
this
is
so
because
of
the
statutes
and
the
interpretations
of
the
statutes
by
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
in
indiana.
the
statute
is
set
down
in
our
briefs
states
that
the
public
defender
--
the
only
method
by
which
an
indigent
can
obtain
a
transcript
is
if
he
is
represented
by
the
public
defender.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
has
stated
that
the
public
defender
need
not
represent
an
indigent
if
he
finds
that
there's
no
merit
to
his
appeal.
it
is
necessary
for
an
indigent
under
rule
240
of
the
indiana
supreme
court
to
file
a
transcript
in
order
to
properly
present
any
errors
that
he
might
claim
on
the
writ
of
error
coram
nobis.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
your
honor,
there
is
a
public
defender
statute
which
provides
for
the
representation
of
indigents
in
certain
counties
in
indiana,
in
the
more
populous
counties.
however,
in
indiana,
if
a
man
seeks
an
appeal
the
--
from
an
original
conviction,
the
court
automatically
appoints
him
counsel
and
if
counsel
can
then
get
a
transcript,
this
is
all
at
the
county's
expense.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
no,
he
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
there
has
been
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
as
pointed
out
on
our
brief
there
has
been
one
distinction
recently
made
in
willoughby
against
state
and
it's
pointed
out
in
the
brief
of
brown,
there
was
a
distinction
made
in
macon
against
orange
county
circuit
court,
wherein
if
the
court
appointed
counsel
and
the
counsel
decided
that
there
was
no
merit
to
his
appeal
in
the
original
conviction,
then
the
court
need
not
have
to
appoint
another
counsel,
if
this
counsel's
determination
was
sufficient.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
in
1851,
i
remember
it
was.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
correct
and
that
is
--
its
my
understanding
that
that
is
true
and
indiana
does
provide
for
counsel
on
appeal
with
these
exceptions
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
right,
your
honor,
it
was.
now,
it
is
this
process
relating
to
belated
appeals
and
the
appointment
of
the
public
defender
that
the
two
courts
below
in
this
process
is
peculiar
to
indiana
which
the
district
court
and
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
below
has
found
denied
equal
protection
to
george
robert
brown.
i
have
divided
my
argument
into
three
phases.
the
first
phase
is
a
discussion
of
the
court's
opinions
below
as
to
their
finding
of
equal
protection.
i
think
it
is
significant
that
the
basis
of
both
of
the
decisions
below
was
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
at
the
second
part
of
my
argument
is
a
discussion
of
this
case
as
it
relates
to
the
due
process
clause.
and
the
third
phase
is
a
discussion
of
this
case
as
it
relates
to
the
federal
process
of
providing
indigents'
appeals
as
outlined
by
this
court
in
the
coppage
case.
as
to
the
first
argument,
as
i
stated
before
i
think
it
is
significant
that
both
of
the
lower
court
base
their
decision
on
the
equal
protection
clause.
indiana
has
classified
for
the
purposes
of
belated
appeals
indigents
and
nonindigents.
if
this
classification
in
and
of
itself
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection,
then
most
assuredly
indiana
has
violated
the
equal
protection
clause.
however,
i
would
submit
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
classification
is
made
between
indigents
and
nonindigents
does
not
in
and
of
itself
deny
a
man
equal
protection.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
unless
the
public
defender
finds
that
there
is
some
merit
to
his
appeal.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
correct,
your
honor,
he
could
have
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
correct.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that
is
the
difference.
as
i
see
it
this
difference
in
and
of
itself
is
not
in
denial
of
equal
protection
because
there
is
a
rational
state
policy
behind
this
classification
and
that
rational
policy
is
the
--
of
the
state
is
to
protect
the
state
against
frivolous
appeals
taken
at
the
state's
expense.
and
that
this
rational
policy
takes
the
classification
out
of
the
proscription
of
the
equal
protection
clause
which
is
against
invidious
discrimination.
i
would
say
that
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
the
griffin
against
illinois,
and
from
smith
against
bennett,
and
from
burns
against
ohio,
which
this
court
found
was
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
in
that
in
every
one
of
those
cases
the
only
thing
that
kept
the
indigent
from
taking
an
appeal
or
in
the
case
of
smith
against
bennett
filing
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
the
fact
that
he
was
an
indigent.
there
was
no
attempt
made
on
the
part
of
the
states
involved
to
inculcate
into
this
process
the
idea
that
there
was
no
merit
to
the
appeal.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
--
that
is
what
i
am
saying
in
essence.
i
am
saying
this
simply
because
the
rich
man
is
treated
differently
than
a
poor
man
by
the
state
does
not
that
mean
that
these
differences
are
protected
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
there
are
several
ways
that
a
rich
man
is
treated
differently
from
a
poor
man
but
there
must
be
this
invidious
discrimination
and
no
rational
state
policy
behind
the
distinction
made
before
it
falls
within
the
proscription
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that
--
your
honor,
that
brings
up
a
point
that
we're
forced
to
assume
that
because
in
griffin
and
in
smith
against
bennett,
and
burns
against
ohio
they
were
talking
--
that
this
court
was
talking
about
a
whole
system
of
law
which
they
said,
this
law
cannot
operate
to
give
equal
protection
to
indigents
because
it
bases
it
strictly
on
the
fact
this
man
is
indigent,
that
he
can't
--
indigency
that
he
can't
appeal.
but
here,
we're
not
talking
about
that.
we're
not
basing
it
strictly
on
his
indigency.
we're
basing
it
on
his
indigency
plus
the
fact
that
he
lacks
merit.
now
--
so,
you
cannot
declare
this
whole
system
of
law
in
indiana
unconstitutional.
but
then
if
you're
declaring
a
particular
application
of
that
law
unconstitutional
and
in
this
case
if
the
public
defender's
decision
had
been
an
error
and
had
it
--
and
there
was
merit
in
the
indigent's
appeal
then
if
there
had
been
a
showing
of
this
and
he
could've
said
that
i've
been
denied
equal
protection.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
that
the
showing
that
he
would
--
that
he
would
have
to
make
would
--
i
think
that
he
could
show
it
in
another
coram
nobis
proceeding.
for
instance,
if
he
said,
i
was
not
--
the
public
defender's
decision
was
an
error
as
to
my
not
having
any
merit
on
this
appeal
or
he
might
show
it
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
federal
court
by
saying,
the
public
defender's
deci
--
denied
me
equal
protection
because
there
was
merit
in
my
appeal.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
it
is
not
available
unless
the
public
defender
provides
him
--
says
that
he
will
represent
him
on
appeal.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
there
has
been
a
transcript
made
of
this
particular
year.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
there
is
a
transcript
in
existence
of
this
particular
coram
nobis
proceeding.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
don't
--
he
couldn't
get
the
transcript.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
he
could
not
get
the
transcript.
now,
there
have
been
times
as
we
pointed
out
on
our
brief
when
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
has
issued
a
show-cause
order
to
the
public
defender
at
least
twice.
and
asked
him
the
--
asked
the
public
defender
to
say,
why
he
thought
there
was
no
merit
in
a
particular
appeal?
when
george
robert
brown
filed
his
petition
for
mandate
in
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
he
made
no
allegation
that
there
had
been
a
dereliction
on
the
duty
of
the
public
defender
that
he
hadn't
properly
said
that
there
was
no
merit
in
his
appeal.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
it's
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
that
is
a
process
whereby
indiana
--
the
supreme
court
sort
of
keeps
watch
over
their
public
defender.
they
don't
order
a
show-cause
in
every
case
they
didn't
in
this
case
and
there's
no
set
standards
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
he
did
not
ask
for
a
show-cause
order,
he
asked
for
a
writ
of
mandate
providing
that
other
counsel
and
for
the
--
a
transcrtipt.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that
the
claim
is
that
--
it
has
been
presented
in
the
--
at
least
i
think
implicitly
in
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
court
below
because
he's
alleged
the
same
thing.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
he
has
alleged
the
exact
same
constitutional
deprivation
in
his
habeas
corpus
petition
as
he
--
as
alleged
in
the
coram
nobis
petition.
so
at
least
inferentially
he's
saying
that
the
public
defender
was
in
error
and
not
appealing.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
court
has
before
it
just
a
report
of
the
public
defender.
there
is
no
transcript
of
the
proceeding
below
before
dakota.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
--
that's
essentially
the
process,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
no,
there
has
not
been
such
an
instance,
mr.
justice
brennan.
there
has
been
only
two
instances
when
the
supreme
court
has
issued
a
show-cause
order,
one
was
on
remand
from
this
court
in
the
mccrary
case
and
another
was
on
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
a
belated
appeal.
and
in
both
of
those
cases
they
issue
a
show-cause
order
and
neither
one
of
them
did
they
find
that
the
public
defender
was
there.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
it
was
so
on
behalf
of
the
court,
yes,
it
was
sua
sponte.
i
think
that
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
stated
before
that
the
equal
protection
argument
does
not
hold
up
in
this
court
because
the
state
of
indiana
has
made
a
classification
but
it
is
imbued
with
a
rationality
that
takes
it
out
of
the
proscription
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that
is
one
difference,
your
honor.
there's
--
the
difference
is
that
in
smith
the
--
it
was
he
didn't
even
--
it
wasn't
even
allowed
to
file
a
habeas
corpus
writ.
yet,
it
have
a
$4
filing
fee
before
a
$20
filing
fee
before
he
can
even
file.
in
this
case,
the
man
is
always
allowed
to
file
his
coram
nobis
or
habeas
corpus
writ
proceeds
if
he
can't
get
counsel,
and
many
times
he's
not
represented
in
the
coram
nobis
proceeding
by
the
public
defender.
he
simply
goes
in
there
by
himself.
now
there's
no
filing
fee
as
to
the
filing
of
this
and
i
can
see
a
distinction
between
the
thing
that
either
attaches
to
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
or
the
similar
writ
in
indiana
coram
nobis.
and
it
seems
to
me
a
less
of
sanctity
that
attaches
to
a
man's
right
to
appeal
from
the
denial
of
one
of
these
writs.
in
the
eskridge
case
which
was
discussed
in
the
previous
argument,
i
would
submit
that
what
this
court
was
really
speaking
of
was
due
process.
and
that
on
the
grounds
of
due
process
that
eskridge
is
distinguishable
from
the
case
in
indiana.
as
we've
stated
in
our
brief
i
don't
think
that
it's
fair
to
cope
the
trial
judge
but
who
passes
on
demands
--
in
one
writ
says
the
man
has
no
right
to
a
new
trial
and
the
next
writ
says
that
he
can't
--
he
has
no
merit
to
his
appeal.
i
think
this
is
a
far
different
process
with
a
very
natural
inclination
that
judges
have
against
being
reversed.
it's
a
different
process
in
putting
this
onus
on
the
part
of
the
man
who
defended
the
indigent
in
the
trial
court
and
saying
that
he
should
initiate
the
appellate
process.
he's
interested
going
to
light,
it
seems
to
me
logically
in
seeing
that
if
there
are
any
error
did
occur
in
the
trial
below
that
this
would
be
reversed
on
the
appeal.
i
think
there
was
a
good
analogy
drawn
yesterday
in
the
gideon
case
when
it
was
brought
out
that
it
probably
wasn't
a
good
idea
to
have
the
judge
wear
two
hats
and
in
one
sense
be
the
judge,
in
the
other
sense
defend
the
man
before
him
and
in
the
same
--
i
would
draw
the
same
analogy
to
hear
this
case
that
it
is
not
a
good
idea
to
have
the
judge
adjudicate
the
case
and
then
initiate
the
appellate
process.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
he
is
appointed
by
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
--
mr.
chief
justice,
and
he
is
--
his
salary
is
set
by
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
i
would
now
turn
to
the
second
part
of
my
argument
which
is
directed
to
the
due
process
argument.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
what
this
court
has
really
been
saying
in
the
eskridge
and
in
the
coppage
case
is
that
it
is
not
fair
to
deny
the
indigent
his
right
to
appeal
in
exactly
the
same
way
that
the
nonindigent
is
given
this
right.
i
would
just
ask
this
one
question,
what
is
unfair
about
this
proceeding?
brown
had
an
attorney
at
the
coram
nobis
hearing.
his
attorney
said,
“there
was
no
merit
to
your
appeal
and
i'm
just
not
going
to
take
it.
i
can't
make
a
travesty
of
my
office
as
a
supreme
court
of
indiana
have
said
and
prosecute
a
frivolous
appeal.
this
would
be
a
violation
of
my
legal
ethics.”
so
far
the
public
defender
or
the
indigent
is
in
no
different
position
than
a
man
with
money
who
went
into
the
coram
nobis
petition
and
his
lawyer
represented
him
to
the
entire
hearing
and
said
there's
no
merit
to
your
appeal
and
i'm
going
to
drop
out.
at
this
point
the
difference
does
change
but
i
would
submit
that
it
does
not
change
in
such
a
manner
as
to
render
the
process
unfair
to
the
indigent.
the
rich
man
can
buy
a
transcript
and
take
it
up
himself
if
he
can't
get
an
attorney.
and
i
would
say
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
that
we
do
assume
that
the
public
defender's
decision
was
right
for
the
purposes
of
his
appeal.
there's
been
no
showing
to
the
contrary.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
that
obviously
if
a
man
had
enough
money
he
could
get
a
lawyer
one
time
or
another
to
represent
him
on
appeal.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
it
seems
to
me
that
when
this
court
is
calling
into
contention
and
state
law
that
is
there
--
that
somebody
has
declared
to
be
unconstitutional
in
this
case
the
two
lower
courts,
if
you're
talking
about
a
system
of
laws
which
if
they
worked
would
operate
not
to
deny
anyone
constitutionality
that
--
unless
there
is
a
showing
if
they
don't
work,
you
must
assume
that
they
do
work
because
if
they
do
work,
then
the
public
defender's
decision
was
right
then
there
wasn't
any
merit
to
his
appeal.
now,
if
you
assume
that
they
don't
work
then
you
can
--
in
that
instance
i
would
submit
to
declare
almost
any
law
unconstitutional
where
anybody
is
set
up
and
given
any
discretion
to
say
if
he
abused
a
discretion,
he
might
deny
some
one
equal
protection
or
due
process.
i
think
this
is
possible
under
any
set
of
law.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
your
honor,
i
would
--
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
submit
that
there
is
undoubtedly
merit
in
your
contention
that
no
man
is
infallible
and
that
his
decision
as
to
their
being
known
no
merit
to
the
appeal
is
--
it's
obviously
not
an
infallible
decision.
but
that
the
--
before
this
decision
should
be
reversed
and
thereby
reversing
the
whole
process
of
laws
that
indiana
has
set
up
providing
for
a
screening
process
for
frivolous
appeals
taken
at
state's
expense
there
should
be
some
showing
in
each
individual
case
that
this
decision
was
in
error.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
would
think
that
was
correct,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that
sua
sponte
at
least
to
date,
mr.
justice
clark
there
has
been
no
application
to
my
knowledge
made
that
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
issue
a
show-cause
order
to
the
public
defender.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
there
is
nothing
in
the
supreme
court
rules
that
provides
that
they
cannot
issue
a
petition
for
a
show-cause
order
but
i
think
in
fairness
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
has
in
recent
decisions
two
of
which
are
now
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court
that
if
an
indigent
from
a
denial
of
a
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
files
a
mandate
seeking
to
order
the
court
below
to
provide
them
with
a
transcript
and
also
counsels
so
that
he
can
appeal
as
the
supreme
court
interprets
its
rules
to
say
that
when
you
submit
a
writ
of
mandate,
you
have
to
have
a
transcript
of
the
court
below
in
order
to
provide
a
sufficient
record
so
we
can
decide
whether
to
provide
you
with
a
writ
of
mandate.
and
they
have
said
since
there
is
no
transcript
filed,
we
will
not
mandate
the
lower
court
to
provide
you
with
a
transcript
which,
of
course,
i
don't
know
that
the
same
reasoning
would
be
applied
if
a
man
petitioned
for
a
show-cause
order.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that
particular
ground
was
not
in
the
writ
of
mandate.
the
writ
of
mandate
simply
said
that
either
was
he
wanted
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
to
provide
him
with
the
transcript
and
with
counsel.
mr.
brown
did
not
allege
in
his
writ
of
mandate
that
the
public
defender
had
been
in
error.
i
would
suppose
that
a
simplicity
in
it
that
he
has
been
in
error.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
this
would
be
in
view
of
the
recent
decisions
i
must
in
candor
say
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
probably
is
not
available.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
because
they
have
been
denying
these
writs
of
mandates
on
the
grounds
that
he
doesn't
have
the
transcript
up
there
and
it's
needed
to
be
there
before
they
can
decide
the
writ
of
mandate.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
there
has
been
no
showing
that
this
is
not.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
would
then
--
that
is
the
way
the
process
in
indiana
works,
mr.
justice
black,
that
i
would
say
that
there
have
been
in
the
cases
that
i
have
cited
when
they
show-cause
order
have
been
issued.
there
has
never
been
a
direct
statement
as
to
why
they
would
give
a
show-cause
order
to
the
public
defender
or
if
a
man
properly
presented
before
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
a
case
showing
a
dereliction
of
the
duty
or
an
abuse
of
discretion
of
the
public
defender
that
they
wouldn't
be
given
a
transcript.
i
submit
this
has
never
been
really
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
up
to
this
date
that
is
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
and
i
cannot
anymore
than
on
a
certain
dicta
--
in
other
cases
say
that
they
would
react
any
different
and
in
view
of
the
decisions
that
they
have
made
in
this
recent
mandate
cases
which
are
here
on
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court.
the
chances
are
they
would
not
review
the
decision
of
the
public
defender
unless
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
--
there
were
some
good
cause
shown
aside
from
the
writ
of
mandate
file.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that
is
not
my
position,
mr.
justice
black.
i
cannot
say
whether
indiana
will
or
not.
i
don't
have
enough
authority
from
the
cases
to
really
say
whether
they
would
or
not.
the
court
hasn't
really
spoken
clearly
enough
on
that
for
me
to
make
that
statement.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
right.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
they
have
never
have
said
it.
i
don't
know
that
we
can
really
say
they
questioned
the
judgment.
they
issued
him
a
show-cause
order.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
we
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
we
did
not
and
we
have
not
in
this
case
in
the
record
on
page
40
and
41,
the
public
defender
so
advised
brown
that
the
attorney
general's
office
would
not
question
his
right
to
file
habeas
corpus
on
the
ground
he
hadn't
exhausted
his
state
remedy.
and
we
do
not
make
a
practice
or
so
do
we.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
don't
know
why,
your
honor,
other
than
to
speculate
why
and
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
on
remand
that
they
were
more
or
less
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
--
forced
to
do
it
there.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
second
case
that
was
decided
on
petition
for
rehearing
on
this
show-cause
order
was
the
willoughby
case
which
was
decided
after
the
order
in
the
district
court
was
issued.
there
is
some
language
in
there
that
would
intimate
that
there
was
an
attempt
to
answer
this
district
court's
opinion
but
i
--
just
a
speculation,
(inaudible).
in
reaching
my
third
argument
i
would
just
say
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
procedure
in
indiana
is
extremely
close
to
the
procedure
that
is
used
in
the
federal
system
is
outlined
in
the
coppage
case.
that
procedure,
as
i
understand
it,
is
outlined
in
the
coppage
case
is
that
the
district
court
makes
the
determination
and
that
there's
a
lack
of
good
faith.
the
convicted
man
appeals
himself
usually
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
standard
there
is
if
the
proceed
pleadings
of
that
man
are
not
clearly
frivolous
then
they
will
grant
him
an
appeal
if
a
transcript
is
needed
in
that
court
to
properly
present
the
errors
alleged
and
the
transcript
is
provided
and
an
attorney
is
appointed.
there
must
be
an
attempt
by
that
attorney
--
by
the
attorney
according
to
the
coppage
case
to
show
the
court
that
the
certificate
of
the
lack
of
good
faith
is
an
error.
now,
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
supposing
the
attorney
has
a
transcript
from
the
lower
court,
it
has
a
quite
voluminous
transcript
and
he
checks
through
this
transcript
and
in
his
opinion
there
is
no
error
in
the
case.
and
he
then
goes
into
the
federal
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
says
in
my
opinion
there
is
no
error
in
this
case.
as
i
read
that
case,
that's
the
end
of
it.
and
it's
this
attorney's
opinion
that
ends
it.
i
submit
that
in
indiana
that
attorney
already
exist
and
he
is
--
have
been
in
a
very
real
sense
already
appointed
by
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
and
he
is
actually
appointed
on
the
statute
and
paid
by
that
court.
and
then
when
he
makes
this
determination,
he
is
making
that
same
determination
that
the
attorney
is
in
the
coppage
case.
now,
there
is
this
distinction
that
the
incomplete
transcript
is
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
but
i
don't
know
that
it
is
really
fair
to
assume
that
in
the
case
of
a
voluminous
transcript,
an
attorney
comes
in
and
says,
“there
is
no
error
in
this
transcript”,
that
the
court
will
then
search
that
transcript
to
find
error
themselves.
i
submit
that
these
procedures
are
so
close
together
as
to
there
to
be
very
little
difference
between
the
federal
procedure
and
the
state
procedure,
and
that
given
this
slight
distinction
between
the
two,
which
i
do
not
believe,
would
deny
an
indigent
in
indiana
due
process
of
law.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
should
take
a
long
look
at
the
indiana
procedure
in
juxtaposition
with
their
own
procedure
before
they
should
overrule
it.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
just
like
to
respond
shortly
to
a
few
of
the
questions
that
arose
during
the
argument
of
respondent's
counsel.
first
of
all,
an
answer
to
a
question
from
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
in
fairness,
we
should
state
that
it
is
not
an
absolute
right
in
indiana
to
be
provided
counsel
at
a
coram
nobis
proceeding.
as
a
matter
of
policy,
the
public
defender
does
represent
the
prisoners
in
the
capital
case
always,
but
they
must
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
--
and
he
did
so
in
this
case,
but
they
must
ask
him
if
they
want
his
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
--
representation
and
often
he
does
not
represent.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
it
has
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
as
to
this
particular
point,
mr.
justice
douglas,
that
we
have
not
cited
that
to
say
that
the
state
of
indiana
will
provide
a
review.
we
have
shown
that
just
to
show
that
in
certain
instances
it
has
provided
review.
they
have
never
stated
the
criteria
by
which
they
will
or
will
not
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
--
grant
a
review.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
as
i
understand
these
decisions,
there
has
never
been
a
question
except
implicitly
in
saying
that
they
should
be
provided
with
other
counsel.
there
has
never
been
stated
in
the
petition
that
the
public
defender
did
abuse
its
discretion
or
there
was
a
dereliction
of
his
duty.
what
the
position
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
would
be
if
there
were
such
an
allegation
made,
i
can't
say.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
as
to
whether
the
same
grounds
that
have
been
raised
in
the
coram
nobis
petition
could
be
raised
in
the
habeas
corpus
petition.
i
would
state
that
the
record
on
page
13
shows,
in
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
just
what
was
alleged
in
the
coram
nobis
proceeding.
it
said
that
that
were
later
or
thereafter
on
may
10th,
1965
in
the
lake
criminal
court
have
verified
petition
for
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
wherein
he
presented
the
questions
noted
as
one
and
two,
that's
in
paragraph
f
on
page
13,
and
one
are
--
and
two
in
the
court's
order
is
cited
on
page
12
on
the
record,
show
that
he
was
--
well,
what
he
alleged
was
that
he
had
inadequate
representation
by
counsel
and
that
the
confession
was
coerced.
now
both
of
those
are
federal
grounds
which
he
could
raise
in
the
habeas
corpus
petition.
that
same
argument
was
made
by
the
state
of
iowa
in
smith
against
bennett
and
this
court
dismissed
this
argument
by
saying
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that
is
what
it
says
right
here
in
his
habeas
corpus
petition
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
these
are
other
--
the
only
two
--
what
he
is
saying
is
the
only
two
grounds
that
were
considered
in
the
--
in
the
coram
nobis
petition
were
these
first
two
grounds,
they
were
also
a
federal
grounds.
the
other
grounds
that
he
raised
were
grounds
that
were
raisable
on
appeal
from
his
original
conviction
and
therefore
are
not
properly
raised
in
the
coram
nobis
proceeding.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
these
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
your
honor
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
brown's
position
in
the
coram
nobis
hearing
was
that
he
had
some
new
evidence
regarding
the
coerced
confession
in
that
this
was
--
this
was
not
discovered
by
him
until
the
time
for
appealing
this
had
expired
and
therefore,
this
was
a
ground
outside
of
the
ground
for
appeal.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
and
this
was
what
the
hearing
was
mainly
about.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
the
inadequate
counsel
had
not
been
considered
on
direct
appeal,
but
it
wasn't
urged
very
strongly
in
the
coram
nobis
proceeding.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
confession
was,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
other
grounds
were
not
considered
because
they
could
have
been
raised
on
appeal.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
were
raised
on
appeal.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
they
were
your
honor,
the
other
two
grounds.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
and
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
no,
that
the
--
the
coerced
confession
was
based
on
new
evidence.
there
wasn't
--
it
was
urged
of
inadequate
counsel
but
this
was
never
really
considered
by
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
on
its
direct
appeal.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
it
was
--
it
was
not
in
--
it
was
not
considered
in
the
opinion
now
whether
it
was
raised
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
--
in
the
brief,
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
it
could
have
been,
yes.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
--
that
was
his
contention,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
precisely
our
position,
mr.
justice
brennan.
that
is
an
answer
to
your
question
why
they
didn't'
consider
this.
we
requested
judge
grant
and
the
court
below
to
consider
these
questions
so
that
we
would
have
the
whole
thing
and
his
position,
as
i
understood
it,
was
that
you
don't
reach
these
questions
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
indiana
under
the
equal
protection
clause
must
give
this
man
an
appeal
from
his
denial
of
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
and
therefore
indiana
hasn't
exhausted
its
state
remedy,
and
that
you
don't
reach
these
other
grounds.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
correct,
your
honor.
this
was
his
determination
that
it
had
--
just
in
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
this
could
not
be
determined
on
appeal
without
transcript,
that's
correct
because
it's
a
question
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
obviously,
they
would
need
a
transcript.
however,
i
would
submit
that
in
the
very
nature
of
these
coram
nobis
proceeding,
it's
not
such
a
difficult
thing
as
it
is
in
a
regular
criminal
conviction
for
an
attorney
to
say
there's
no
merit
on
appeal.
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
petitioner,
in
this
case
brown.
the
hearing
has
had
before
a
judge.
there
were
actually
few
points
brought
up
in
this
particular
proceeding
and
it's
in
the
very
nature
of
these
proceedings
they're
using
are
brought
on
one
or
two
points
and
that
it's
not
impossible
for
an
attorney
to
look
at
the
question
and
say,
“well,
it's
just
a
question
of
fact
and
there's
no
chance
for
us
to
overturn
it
and
therefore
i
won't
appeal
it.”
just
to
make
once
again,
it's
clear
as
i
can
the
position
of
the
state
in
this
proceeding.
our
position
is
that
the
public
defender's
office
as
it
presently
functions
in
indiana,
does
not
operate
to
deny
an
indigent
due
process
of
law
or
equal
protection
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
went
into
the
discussion
yesterday
of
the
show-cause
order
just
to
buttress
the
idea
that
the
screening
process
that
has
been
set
up
by
indiana
does
not
make
this
denial
of
his
transcript
fall
within
the
proscription
of
the
equal
protection
or
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
your
honor,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
certainly
in
copies
that
would
probably
be
more
amenable
to
this
court,
but
i
would
submit
that
the
process
of
indiana
has
devised
in
these
post
conviction
writs
is
a
--
as
reasonable
a
process
and
provides
as
adequate
a
substitute
for
appeal
as
would
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
reviewing
these
petitions
themselves
or
reviewing
the
request
of
the
indigents
to
appeal
themselves.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
this
would
be
the
position
of
the
courts
below,
mr.
justice
black,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
are
saying
the
state
has
a
rational
policy
against
frivolous
appeals
taken
at
the
state's
expense
that
this
would
only
apply
to
screening
those
appeals
taken
from
indigents
because
those
are
the
ones
that
are
taken
at
state's
expense
and
not
the
screening
of
appeals
for
non-indigents.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
they
are
handling
it
to
a
certain
extent.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
five.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
do
--
i
would
not
have
those
figures,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
way
you
see
it
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
would
--
i
wouldn't
assume
that
it
would
taken
as
much
time
as
it
would
to
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
would
--
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that
because
that
a
man
who
has
money
and
under
the
particular
--
peculiar
procedure
of
indiana
where
he
can
buy
a
transcript
and
take
it
before
the
supreme
court
with
a
non-meritorious
appeal
that
this
is
a
right
that
should
be
also
granted
to
an
indigent
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
it
would
--
he
is
not
being
treated
equally
but
i
would
submit
that
this
is
not
an
equality
that
is
protected
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
appeal
of
the
rich
man
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
no,
it
cannot,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that
--
that
is
the
difference.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
this
was
our
position
in
the
court
below.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
the
position
now
must
be
that
in
attempting
to
fight
the
decision
that
indiana
has
denied
an
equal
protection
in
not
giving
him
an
appeal.
we
say
that
his
rights
have
been
protected
by
the
public
defender's
decision
and
that
the
federal
court
below
should
review
these
questions
and
as
to
their
merit
and
that
should
be
the
end
of
it.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
these
--
these
questions
would
be
raised
anew
in
the
federal
court
below.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
everything
that
was
in
the
transcript
at
the
coram
nobis
proceeding
would
--
the
same
things
presumably
would
be
in
the
--
the
hearing
before
the
sup
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
don't
think
they
would
be
reviewing
that
decision,
mr.
justice
black.
this
would
be
a
new
determination
by
them
based
on
a
new
record
on
a
hearing
on
the
same
allegations
as
in
the
coram
nobis.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
of
the
regular
trial.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that's
why
he
--
he
has
the
transcript
for
the
regular
trial.
that's
provided
to
every
indigent
in
indiana.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
that
has
been
our
position,
there
are
--
a
fact
situation
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
--
that
could
have
rise
or
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
no,
the
writ
of
mandate,
we
claim
is
not
available
to
him
because
under
the
state
law,
he
can't
get
a
transcript
if
the
public
defender
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
different
case
as
far
as
the
question
in
which
mr.
justice
white
holds.
however,
i
would
still
contend
that
the
public
defender's
system
has
it
had
--
it
is
--
has
arisen
does
not
deny
him
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that
is
our
position,
your
honor,
however,
the
question
has
been
decided
below
and
it's
certainly
before
this
court,
i
would
say.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
that
is
a
deprivation,
your
honor,
and
certainly
under
griffin
and
under
smith
against
bennett,
burns
against
ohio,
those
are
--
that's
a
denial
of
equal
protection
or
due
process.
we
say
that's
not
what's
happened
here.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
under
the
decision
of
this
court,
i
would
say
yes,
they
have.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
only
right
to
which
he
is
entitled
is
a
right
to
an
appeal.
the
difficulty,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
got
into
is
the
conceptual
difficulty
of
bringing
up
on
habeas
corpus.
a
man's
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights
as
regard
to
his
--
regard
to
his
appeal
from
a
post
conviction
remedy
that
the
only
ultimate
authority
that
the
court
has
under
habeas
corpus
is
to
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
--
let
the
man
go
free
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
and
that's
what
the
court
has
been
doing
over
and
over
again
in
these
habeas
corpus
cases
is
giving
the
courts
or
the
states
time
to
correct
the
wrongs
and
then
if
the
state
doesn't
act,
ultimately,
all
you
can
do
is
to
let
him
go
free.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
wouldn't
say
so,
certainly,
that
that
is
not
what
the
court
has
to
do
now
and
it's
not
what
they've
done
in
the
past.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
under
the
law
as
it
now
stands
in
indiana
and
if
this
--
i
--
if
the
rational
policy
against
providing
appeals,
frivolous
appeals
at
public
expense
is
to
have
any
basis,
i
would
say
that
the
transcript
would
not
be
--
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
in
the
habeas,
yes.
yes,
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
civil
proceeding.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
well,
i
had
to
consider
that,
your
honor,
if
he
wanted
to
try
and
discover
these
things.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
can't
say
whether
we
would
contest
that
now
or
not.
i
haven't
thought
about
them.
mr.
william
d.
ruckelshaus
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor,
we
would.
