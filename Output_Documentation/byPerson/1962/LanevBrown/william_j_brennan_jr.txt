justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
there
been
an
instance
where
the
supreme
court
said,
well,
do
you
think
perhaps
your
judgment
is
not
fit
to
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
that
show-cause
sua
sponte?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
(inaudible)
the
difference
in
the
smith
case,
the
iowa
case
on
the
transcript
on
appeal
(inaudible)
the
only
difference
from
smith
here
is
the
public
defender,
a
public
officer
is
said
the
appeal
is
without
merit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
apart
in
any
event
where
the
sua
sponte
on
application,
the
show-cause
order,
the
writ
mandate
accomplished
that
all
those
things
(inaudible)
was
in
this
very
case
wasn't
there
an
application
to
the
supreme
court
for
writ
of
mandate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
ground
that
the
public
defender
had
wrongly
refused
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
also
--
but
that
was
--
that
would
seem
to
be
more
orderly
so
to
remedy
it,
the
writ
upon
propriety
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
is
not
,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
interested
--
and
i
suppose
you
don't
really
know
why
in
the
two
cases
where
it
was
done,
the
supreme
court
did
ask
the
public
defender
to
show-cause
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
for
one
of
them
we
sent
back
and
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
information
i
gather,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
you're
saying
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
to
the
federal
district
court
bent
over
backwards
to
give
the
state
judiciary
an
opportunity
to
deal
with
the
merits
under
the
fact
on
the
conviction,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
this
neither,
in
the
federal
district
court
nor
in
the
court
--
court
of
appeals,
is
there
any
revelation
of
what
the
grounds
are
upon
which
he
attacks
the
conviction
itself,
is
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
known
at
the
prison
as
the
writ
department?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
briefly,
can
you
tell
me
what
the
--
what
claims
are
addressed
to
the
conviction
itself.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
what
--
a
coerced
confessions
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
never
suggested
to
the
district
court
that
these
circumstances,
the
court
might
have
dealt
with
those
constitutional
claims
rather
than
the
one
the
one
of
denial
of
transcript,
did
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
it
comes
down
to
is
that
the
--
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
sustained,
he
is
ordered
to
discharge
not
because
of
any
constitutional
defect
or
a
conviction
of
a
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
only
because
he's
not
been
given
an
opportunity
to
appeal
from
the
conviction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
does
indiana
[inaudible]?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
petition
if
all
he
alleged
was
state
grounds
on
that
which
could
not
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
levy,
which
facts
[inaudible]?
i
gather
on
direct
appeal
[inaudible]?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
the
record
is
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
state
court
has
no
jurisdiction
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
claimed
in
the
appeal,
the
denial
for
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
levy,
suppose
either
by
statute
or
rule,
it
was
the
requirement
applicable
to
rich
and
poor
litigants
alike,
that
as
a
condition
to
an
appeal,
the
attorney
who
tried
this
case
must
certify
that
the
grounds
of
appeal
are
not
frivolous.
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that,
applicable
to
rich
litigants
and
poor
litigants
alike?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
under
those
circumstances
that
the
public
defender
represented
a
poor
litigant
and
he
refused
to
make
that
certification,
you
wouldn't
be
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
doesn't
[inaudible]
for
a
trial
judge
in
brown's
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
a
hearing
of
hours
long
or
day's
long,
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
a
lawyer
representing
him
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
levy,
do
you
suggest
that
he
might
be
retried,
that
is
the
difficulty.
in
these
circumstances,
why
wouldn't
his
prior
conviction
be
a
perfect
double
jeopardy
defense
if
they
try
to
retry
him
on
the
same
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
levy,
in
those
cases,
the
result
of
habeas
corpus
has
been
to
invalidate
the
conviction.
here,
as
i
understand
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
there's
no
invalidation
of
the
conviction
it's
because
there
has
been
no
right
of
appeal
from
that
conviction
afforded,
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
he's
entitled
to
be
released
but
how
can
he
be
tried
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
while
that
conviction
stands?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
--
this
jurisdictional
ground
that
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
could
not
obtain
the
appeal
without
a
transcript,
is
that
a
matter
of
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
they'd
--
they
might
be
--
if
there
is
a
defect
that
is
correctible
by
the
court
itself
without
legislative
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
if
they
may
vary,
it's
hard
to
see
how
it's
jurisdictional,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
--
this
case
might've
been
disposed
off
by
the
federal
district
court
by
finding
that
there'd
been
an
exhaustion
of
state
remedy
and
then
deciding
on
the
merits,
the
federal
claims
both
the
alleged
coerced
confession
and
the
alleged
inadequacy
of
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
whether
there
has
been
exhaustion
as
a
federal
question
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
see
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
you're
suggesting
or
i
thought
you
didn't
answer
my
last
question
that
we
don't
really
have
to
reach
that
question
here,
if
indeed
what
the
district
court
should
have
done,
while
to
give
him
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
his
federal
claims
addressed
through
the
conviction
itself,
treating
everything
else
that
happened
merely
as
an
exhaustion
of
state
remedy,
state
proceeding
that
they
were
exhausted
under
these
circumstances.
and
therefore,
that
there
was
no
state
remedy
available
to
him
and
he's
entitled
to
a
federal
court
disposition
under
federal
habeas
of
his
federal
claim.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
your
position
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
the
district
court
i
take
it,
would
have
available,
certainly
the
transcript
of
the
trial
itself
if
it
were
a
regular
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
only
--
the
only
transcript
that
we've
been
talking
about
is
whatever
this
transcript
is
of
the
coram
nobis
proceeding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
don't
you
agree
that
this
would
be
a
very
different
case,
if
the
only
questions
he
had
which
had
not
been
reviewed
were
state
law
questions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
point
is,
you
have
to
defend
then
the
present
system
as
were
nothing
but
state
law
questions
involved,
but
because
it's
attack
on
the
merits
of
his
conviction
involved
only
two
federal
law
questions.
your
position
is
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
questions
raised
as
to
the
public
defender's
certification,
because
the
district
court
ought
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
federal
claims,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
you
are
right
that
the
district
court
should
have
reached
the
merits
of
the
federal
claims,
i
don't
know
whether
they're
relevant
or
not,
could
the
proceedings
on
coram
nobis
even
though
not
made
available
for
purposes
of
appeal
in
the
supreme
court,
could
they
be
made
available
to
the
federal
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
indiana
would
be
a
party,
that
it
is
a
party
to
the
litigation,
isn't
it,
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
well,
now
what
is
--
what
is
a
federal
habeas,
is
it
civil
or
criminal
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
federal
rules
of
civil
discovery
and
civil
proceedings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
what
grounds
it
was
contested?
