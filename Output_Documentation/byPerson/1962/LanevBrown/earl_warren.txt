how
does
your
public
defender
obtain
his
office?
is
it
elective
office?
is
he
appointed
by
--
chief

earl
warren
by
the

chief

mr.
levy.
chief

we'll

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
--
ward
lane,
warden,
petitioner,
versus
george
robert
brown.
mr.
levy,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
levy
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you're
assigned
by
the
court
below
to
represent
this
defendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
those
circumstances
i
know
the
court
would
have
me
express
its
appreciation
to
you
for
having
accepted
this
burdensome
task.
that
we're
always
comforted
to
know
that
indigent
defendants
may
get
good
representation
in
this
court
from
lawyers
doing
a
public
service
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
we
thank
you
and
your
associate
for
your
representation
here
and
mr.
attorney
general,
we
appreciate
the
table
and
energetic
manner
in
which
you
have
represented
the
interest
of
your
state,
too.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
some
time
left,
should
you
want
to
respond?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
general,
don't
--
don't
you
think
the
--
an
appeal
taken
by
a
frivolous
moneyed
defendant
who
is
entitled
to
go
through
the
entire
procedure
of
an
appeal
where
the
time
of
the
court,
or
the
supreme
court
is
occupied,
all
of
the
employees
of
the
court
are
--
their
time
has
taken,
do
you
not
think
that
they
are
there
handling
an
appeal
with
a
frivolous
appeal
at
the
expense
of
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
--
isn't
that
expense
much
greater
than
the
expense
of
a
transcript?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
supreme
court
justices
have
you
got?
chief
justice
earl
warren
five
of
them
do
you
not
think
that
the
combined
salaries
of
those
justices
and
all
of
their
clerks
and
marshals
and
everybody
in
the
courtroom
to
hear
a
frivolous
appeal
by
a
moneyed
defendant
is
more
expensive
to
the
state
than
the
mere
filings
of
a
transcript?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
here,
we're
talking
about
an
appeal
that's
supposed
to
be
frivolous
and
you're
taking
--
we're
taking
the
time
of
all
of
this
court
to
determine
and
i
suppose
you
can
do
the
same
thing
in
your
supreme
court
if
--
if
a
man
has
the
money
to
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
