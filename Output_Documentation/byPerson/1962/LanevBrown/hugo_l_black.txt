justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
bothered
by
the
same
point
that
justice
stewart
suggested
with
this
that
makes
the
statement
of
the
public
defender
findings
so
far
as
his
(inaudible)
bars
him
from
having
a
review.
now,
if
he
could
assume
infallibility,
that
would
be
would
what
--
or
even
for
more.
i
would
say
if
i've
read,
you
tried
many
cases,
you'd
see
that
sometimes
you
win
them
on
points
you
--
you
wouldn't
thought
some
(inaudible)
about
and
sometimes
you
lose
them
on
points
if
you
thought
a
lot
of
that.
and
how
can
we
know
that
--
why
isn't
it
inevitable
that
frequently
a
lawyer
will
make
a
mistake
about
that
that
the
man
who
has
the
money
and
goes
on
well
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
thing
it
bothered
me
about
your
answer
to
my
question.
you
replied
(inaudible)
well,
you
shouldn't
pick
out
a
case
that
had
--
might
have
been
not
known
before.
now,
that
issue
which
was
in
the
case
before
us,
as
i
understand
it,
is
not
in
your
case,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
a
case
before,
they
insisted
that
the
state
had
shown
that
there
was
no
merit.
but
you
don't
insist
that
(inaudible).
you
--
i
understand
you're
going
on
the
basis
that
the
decision
of
the
--
at
least
such
(inaudible)
as
of
today,
that
the
decision
of
the
public
defender
that
the
cases
without
merit
ends
it,
there's
no
other
remedy
that
has
to
be
accepted
right
or
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
far
as
the
free
transcript
is
concerned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
i
would
judge
the
facts,
the
arguments
you're
making
if
that
would
be
a
good
reason,
a
natural
thing
and
proper
thing
to
do
in
your
case,
if
one
accepted
that
or
either
a
mandate
to
your
court
to
find
out
whether
or
not
that
is
the
ground.
so
far
as
i
think
we
have
to
accept
it.
i
had
understood
(inaudible)
we
have
to
accept
that
the
holding
by
your
court,
the
decision
of
the
public
defender
is
final,
that
ends
it,
we
cannot
get
a
free
transcript
and
there's
no
remedy
in
the
state
of
indiana.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
not
suggesting
then
as
representing
an
attorney
general
but
we
can
go
on
the
basis
that
indiana
may
provide
such
a
remedy
and
may
not
consider
the
public
defender's
decision
as
final
and
irrevocable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
getting
a
way
--
getting
a
way
in
the
supreme
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
instead
of
having
a
statute
they
have
--
i
want
to
ask
in
connection
with
your
justification
--
discussion
a
moment
ago,
had
a
statute
which
says
all
indigents
were
unable
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
the
appeal
or
to
obtain
a
transcript,
shall
be
granted
a
transcript
free
by
the
state,
provided,
however,
that
the
--
if
the
indigent
shows
the
questions
that
are
to
be
raised
so
that
the
court,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
can
pass
upon
them
as
a
supreme
court
rather
than
as
a
public
defender
pass
on
it
and
determine
clearly
that
the
points
are
frivolous,
no
one
of
them
has
merit,
would
you
be
saying
what
you're
saying
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
they
could
tell
from
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
tell
and
they
could
pass
on
it.
you
would
not
be
challenging
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
saying
now
is
as
i
understand
it,
that
they
have
turned
over
the
responsibility
to
determine
whether
a
man
has
points
that
are
not
frivolous
to
a
public
defender,
not
the
supreme
court
and
that
the
people
who
are
able
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
and
get
their
records
don't
have
to
depend
on
the
final
decision
of
the
public
defender
but
can
go
to
the
supreme
court
itself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
think
your
case
would
be
stronger
or
weaker,
have
any
effect
on
it
at
all
if
the
statute
had
provided
that
the
court
should
make
its
own
investigation
to
determine
whether
there
was
the
ground
for
frivolous
and
the
action
has
been
taken
under
that
rather
than
leaving
that
power
to
the
public
defender?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
think
that
your
situation
in
the
statute
would
be
any
different
if
the
statute
has
provided
that
in
all
cases
there
is
an
appeal
whether
by
person
who's
able
to
buy
transcripts
or
not,
the
public
defender
could
pass
on
the
--
whether
the
grounds
were
frivolous,
and
let
him
dispose
of
it
rather
the
supreme
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
case
cannot
be
dismissed
i
gather
without
[inaudible]
action
by
the
supreme
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
man
who
has
the
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
difference,
one,
the
public
defender,
one,
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you'd
have
done
it
without
a
transcript.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
--
do
you
think
the
federal
court
could
pass
on
them
without
a
transcript?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
about
a
transcript
of
the
hearing,
the
trial?
