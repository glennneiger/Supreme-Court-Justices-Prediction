justice
john
m.
harlan
the
statute
seems
to
(inaudible)
that
proceeding
--
state
collateral
proceedings.
do
you
have
a
public
defender
statute
that
covers
representation
of
indigents
in
the
trial
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
public
defender
didn't
represent
this
man
at
the
original
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
why
there
is
a
(inaudible)
court
procedures
is
of
--
is
the
way
of
reviewing
the
discretion
so
to
speak
of
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
of
the
public
defender,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
did
he
ask
for
one
in
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
you
would
say
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
talking
about
irvin
against
dowd?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
this
argument
directed
to,
jurisdiction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
that
the
state
said
in
its
letter
to
your
client,
the
public
defender
said
that
he'd
taken
the
matter
up
with
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
general
will
concede
that
you've
exhausted
your
state
remedies.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
your
point
is
that
so
far
as
these
grounds
were
state
grounds
of
appeal,
the
federal
court
is
without
jurisdiction
to
review
those
on
federal
habeas
corpus
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
but
you
can
only
get
those
in
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
state
court,
that's
your
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
that
indiana
in
a
case
(inaudible)
in
forma
pauperis
appeal
have
said
--
had
established
a
commission
of
the
board
of
three
judges
or
quasi
judges
and
then
provided
that
any
indigent
who
wanted
to
appeal
should
submit
his
points
to
this
board
and
its
determination
was
to
be
final
as
to
whether
he
had
a
frivolous
or
non-frivolous
appeal
and
the
determination
of
the
board
was
un-reviewable,
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
arguing
in
effect
is
that
an
indigent
as
a
matter
of
right,
in
all
circumstances
he's
got
a
right
to
get
a
record,
get
a
transcript
to
find
out
whether
he's
got
any
asset
--
to
any
legitimate
points
of
appeal.
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
the
state
has
said
you
have
that
at
public
expense
if
you
showed
you've
got
a
non-frivolous
appeal?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
what
you're
arguing
in
effect
is,
if
i'm
wrong
i
wish
you'd
tell
me,
that
in
a
case
where
the
state
conditions
a
right
of
appeal
upon
a
furnishing
of
a
transcript
to
the
record,
an
indigent
in
all
circumstances
is
entitled
to
get
a
copy
of
the
record.
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
a
state
cannot
protect
itself,
could
not
draw
any
lines,
and
take
any
measures
to
protect
itself
from
having
to
furnish
at
public
expense
a
transcript
of
the
record.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
you're
avoiding
my
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
may
say
so.
i'm
postulating
a
question,
a
situation
which
you
have
here
that
the
state
says,
“you
got
to
have
a
proper
bill
of
exceptions
or
proper
transcript.”
justice
john
m.
harlan
must
do
it
in
and
the
state
can't
take
any
measures
to
protect
itself
having
a
better
condition
to
appeal.
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
he
under
a
death
sentence?
