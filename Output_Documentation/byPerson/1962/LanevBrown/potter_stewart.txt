justice
potter
stewart
but
he
was
represented
by
counsel
at
the
trial
and
on
the
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
a
matter
of
universal
protection
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
indiana,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
--
as
to
your
state,
i've
--
i'm
remembering
what
mr.
justice
black
wrote
in
dissenting
betts
against
brady,
quoting
an
opinion
of
the
indiana
supreme
court
dating
way
back,
i
think,
it
was
--
at
the
civil
war
time.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
before
as
to
the
right
of
counsel
on
a
criminal
trial
in
your
state
and
then
judge
traynor
in
california
dissenting
in
the
brown
case
referred
to
your
state
as
one
of
two
in
the
whole
country
that
guaranteed
counsel
on
appeal
in
a
criminal
case
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
given
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
saying
is
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
rich
man
has
a
right
to
throw
his
money
away
doesn't
give
the
poor
man
a
constitutional
right
to
throw
the
state's
money
away,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
by
--
you're
presuming,
your
hypothesis
is
that
this
appeal
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
a
frivolous
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
transcript
in
fact
available
of
the
coram
nobis
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
it's
not
available
for
the
purpose
of
appealing
the
coram
nobis
of
hearing
unless
the
public
defender
agrees.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
--
that's
the
issue
in
this
case
but
what
i
mean
to
say
is,
is
the
transcript
made
of
every
coram
nobis
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
(inaudible)
note?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you're
saying
that
in
a
another
kind
of
review
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
could
not
get
the
transcript.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
there
is
no
plain
--
except
implicitly,
is
there
that
there
--
that
there
is
any
manner
in
this
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
the
fact
that
he
wants
to
appeal
is
in
of
course
an
implicit
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
claim
that
there
might
be
merit.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
part
of
your
argument
that
frankly
has
caused
me
a
little
difficulty
because
it's
so
difficult
for
me
to
see
in
something
as
subjective.
so
in
exact
as
the
--
as
our
profession
is,
how
you
can
--
how
it's
possible
to
state
as
a
factual
hypothesis
an
appeal
is
completely
without
merit,
completely
frivolous,
how
it's
possible
to
assume
that
if
you
--
a
rich
man
consulted
a
thousand
lawyers,
they'd
all
tell
them
the
same
thing
--
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
assuming
ethical
lawyers
who
and
lawyers
who
--
there
are
some
who
would
just
do
it
to
for
the
fee
maybe
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
--
so
i
can
be
sure
i'm
right
about
what
your
state
does,
mr.
levy.
this
defendant
had
counsel
at
his
trial
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
your
state
provides
everybody
with
counsel
--
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
trial.
he
took
an
appeal
and
he
had
the
advise
and
help
of
the
lawyer
on
the
appeal
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
your
state
provides
everybody
with
a
lawyer
on
appeal,
in
a
felony
cases,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this,
in
many
event,
this
man
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
had
counsel
on
his
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
still
--
it
was
thought
to
be
the
rule
that
everybody,
in
a
felony
case,
has
--
automatically
gets
the
help
of
counsel
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
the
appeal.
this
man
had
a
lawyer
at
the
postconviction
proceedings
and
the
habeas
--
in
the
coram
nobis
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
provided
by
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
the
scope
of
this
rule
is
limited
to
an
appeal
from
denial
of
a
coram
nobis
remedy,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
about
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it’s
a
post
conviction
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
limited
to
a
post
conviction,
an
appeal
from
the
denial
of
a
post
conviction
remedy.
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
you
this
while
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i've
interrupted
you.
is
there
an
absolute
right
to
counsel
in
the
trial
court
in
a
post
conviction
remedy?
in
this
case,
the
public
defender
did
represent
the
petitioner
in
the
trial
court,
in
a
coram
nobis
hearing.
was
that
an
absolute
right
under
indiana
law?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
take
the
denial
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
without
prejudice
to
mean
as
distinguished
from
a
mere
denial
of
certiorari?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
have
been
reviewed
once
on
direct
appeal
from
the
conviction,
where
he
was
represented
by
counsel
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
he's
represented
by
a
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
was
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
here.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
denied.
justice
potter
stewart
so
there
was
a
complete
review
of
--
in
which
he
had
the
advice
of
a
lawyer
all
the
way.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
an
opinion
of
the
indiana
supreme
court,
wasn't
it,
the
first
time?
justice
potter
stewart
in
affirming
the
conviction?
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
gather
from
that,
i
suppose,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
mr.
levy,
assume
this
case,
assume
that
as
here,
there
was
a
trial
and
a
conviction
with
the
defendant
represented
by
a
lawyer
and
there
was
an
appeal
with
the
appellant
represented
by
a
lawyer
and
the
conviction
was
affirmed.
the
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court
had
been
denied
and
then
a
coram
nobis
procedure
was
initiated
in
which
the
identical
ground,
the
identical
grounds
were
asserted
as
had
been
asserted
originally
on
the
appeal
and
this
was
made
clear.
now
do
you
think
that
the
state
of
indiana
is
constitutionally
required
to
furnish
at
its
expense
a
process
of
another
appeal
on
the
identical
grounds
under
which
had
already
been
decided?
in
other
words,
i'm
just
testing
as
to
whether
or
not
there
might
not
be
some
relevance
as
to
what
was
alleged
in
this
coram
nobis.
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
means
that
a
rich
man
who
wants
to
do
it
has
a
constitutional
right
to
pour
his
money
down
a
sewer,
but
the
question
is
whether
an
indigent
has
the
right
to
compel
the
state
to
pour
its
money
down
a
sewer?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
by
hypothesis,
you've
already
lost
a
trial
or
you
wouldn't
be
on
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
levy,
if
you're
right,
to
what
relief
do
you
think
your
client
is
entitled
to
at
this
stage?
justice
potter
stewart
be
released.
now,
here's
a
man
who
has
been
tried
and
convicted,
represented
by
a
counsel
and
took
an
appeal,
represented
by
a
counsel
and
his
conviction
was
affirmed,
and
certiorari
was
denied
here,
and
then
he
had
a
coram
nobis
proceeding
in
which
he
was
represented
by
counsel.
and
the
public
defender
has
found
that
there
is
absolutely
no
merit
whatsoever
in
his
appeal,
do
you
think
he's
entitled
to
be
released?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
all
he's
been
denied
even
if
you
are
right
is
the
right
to
an
appeal
from
the
denial
of
his
coram
nobis
and
that's
all
he's
entitled
to,
isn't
it?
if
--
even
if
you're
completely
right.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
indiana
said
so,
but
if
we
--
but
if
you're
right,
then
we
would
hold
it
and
indiana
must
provide
a
way.
if
indiana
provides
a
way,
that's
all
he's
entitled
to,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
prevail
in
this
court
and
indiana
then
says,
“oh,
yes.
now
we'll
--
the
supreme
court
has
told
us
we
--
we've
got
to
offer
this
fellow
an
appeal
with
the
transcript
and
a
lawyer,
and
if
indiana
proceeds
to
do
it,
then
you
gotten
everything
that
you
say
you're
entitled
to
under
the
constitution",
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
this
man
was
convicted
of
what,
killing
several
and
raping
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
several
teenage
girls,
burying
their
bodies
in
the
sand
up
there.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
are
several
other
alleged
victims
of
these
activities.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
hasn't
the
--
hasn't
it
been
stayed
pending
the
proceedings?
justice
potter
stewart
as
well
as
the
execution
of
the
petitioner
about
the
respondent
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
so
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
not
right
in
recalling
that
inadequate
representation
and
coerced
confession
are
both
raised
on
direct
appeal.
i
have
a
dim
recollection
of
this
case
when
it
came
here
in
the
1959
term
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
affirmance
of
the
conviction
by
the
indiana
supreme
court.
and
there
were,
as
i
recall,
claims
of
a
coerced
confession,
inadequate
representation
by
counsel
and
the
admission
of
several
very
lurid
photographs
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
corpses
of
the
victims
and
who
had
been
buried
in
the
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
sand.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
the
appeal
is
really
frivolous
and
if
there
are
competent
judges
it's
not
going
to
take
them
much
time,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
ruckelshaus,
if
the
respondent
is
right
in
this
case,
to
what
relief
do
you
think
he's
entitled
to?
justice
potter
stewart
to
release
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
to
release
but
you
can
release
conditionally.
you
can
release
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
but
certainly
it
can
be
