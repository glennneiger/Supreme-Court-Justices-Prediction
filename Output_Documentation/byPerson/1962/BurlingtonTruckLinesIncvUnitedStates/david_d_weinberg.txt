mr.
david
d.
weinberg
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
general

and
helpers
union,
local
number
554
in
case
number
28.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
does
not
have
the
power
to
determine
labor
disputes
even
those
involving
common
carriers.
it
has
the
power
of
granting
motor
carrier
certificates
for
convenience
and
necessity
and
determining
complaint
cases
involving
refusal
of
motor
carriers
to
serve
shippers
and
to
prevent
discrimination
with
regard
to
shippers.
now
the
power
of
the
icc,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
grant
certificates
of
convenience
and
necessity
cannot
be
exercised
on
the
basis
of
a
temporary
stoppage
of
service
resulting
from
a
labor
dispute.
whether
the
stoppage
of
service
is
forced
upon
the
carrier
by
strike
action
or
directed
against
him
because
of
his
voluntary
compliance
with
a
lawful
contract.
and
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
goldberg,
in
order
to
properly
orient
this
matter
with
regard
to
the
"hot
cargo"
clauses,
there
is
a
cut-off
date
by
virtue
with
the
passage
of
the
landrum-griffin
act.
i
think
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
one
of
the
reasons
given
in
the
legislative
history
for
8
(e)
under
the
landrum-griffin
act
are
the
very
facts
that
are
contained
in
this
case.
so
when
we
consider
the
temporary
or
permanent
nature
of
this
particular
matter,
we
must
consider
pre-1959
periods.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
i
do
not
go
that
far.
i
think
some
"hot
cargo"
clause
can
be
structured
within
the
framework
of
section
8
(e)
that
would
make
them
legal.
i
don't
think
section
8
(e)
banned
all
"hot
cargo"
clauses.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
now,
i
would
say
that
it
did
and
the
record
doesn't
show
this,
mr.
justice,
but
the
teamsters
union
redid
their
"hot
cargo"
clause
after
section
8
(e)
and
i
don't
know
whether
you
can
take
judicial
notice
of
that.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
for
what
its
worth
--
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
--
there
is
a
change,
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
yes.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
but
i
do
not
want
this
court
to
get
the
idea
that
there
--
that
section
8
(e)
banned
all
"hot
cargo"
clauses
because
i
do
not
think
it
did.
there
are
some
exceptions
for
example
in
the
apparel
industry.
there
are
some
exceptions
in
the
construction
industry.
and
most
assuredly
i
think
in
my
opinion
there
are
exceptions
in
the
trucking
industry.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
you
do
not
have
that
problem.
but
it
does
have
some
effect
to
show
and
to
negate
the
argument
of
the
government
that
this
was
not
a
temporary
matter.
when
in
fact
congress,
who
should
consider
this
in
the
first
instance
and
not
the
courts
or
the
interstate
commerce
commission
--
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
that's
all
that
was
invoked.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
yes.
article
ix
--
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
he
could
not
be
discharged
--
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
--
for
fan
--
for
handling
unfair
goods.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
yes.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
yes.
but
that's
the
very
"hot
cargo"
clause,
mr.
justice
that
was
presented
to
congress
in
the
8
(e)
legislative
history.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
yes,
it
was.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
the
interruptions
took
place
by
virtue
of
the
teamsters
union
invoking
article
ix
--
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
by
sending
notice
to
the
carriers
--
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
--
that
under
that
article,
they
could
not
handle
unfair
freight.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
that
particular
clause
did,
mr.
justice.
there
are
some
refinements
to
this
clause
in
some
of
those
agreements.
but
that
particular
clause
did
and
it's
in
the
record
here
i'm
sure,
article
ix,
that's
urged
when
--
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
that's
right.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
upon
notice.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
it
had
that
too
in
there.
the
first
paragraph
in
the
clause
had,
"it
shall
not
be
a
cause
for
discharge
for
an
individual
employee
to
refuse
to
handle
unfair
goods."
but
then
it
went
further
and
stated
that
the
employer
would
have
to
act
upon
proper
notice
from
the
union.
i
think
that
clause
is
in
the
record
here
and
i
think
mr.
axelrod
will
help
me
find
it
so
that
you
can
read
it.
but
the
main
gist
of
this
situation
is
this,
that
the
icc
is
in
conflict
with
the
national
labor
policy
in
this
particular
case.
if
the
icc
could
act
in
this
case,
this
would
constitute
a
method
of
regulating
labor
disputes
in
the
transportation
industry.
the
award
of
a
certificate
to
a
rival
carrier
is
at
least
as
forceful,
a
method
of
regulation
as
an
award
of
damages
for
failure
to
serve
the
public
which
would
fall
under
the
garmon
decision
of
this
court.
it
is
irrelevant
in
examining
this
situation
for
the
commission
not
to
look
to
the
merits
of
a
labor
dispute
and
to
say
that
it
is
not
attempting
to
resolve
that
labor
dispute.
the
question
is
entirely
one
of
the
effect
and
this
court
had
the
opportunity
to
consider
that
in
local
24
versus
oliver,
revel
versus
oliver,
358
u.s.
283,
where
this
court
held
that
ohio
could
not
outlaw
owner
operator
clauses
which
were
authorized
by
national
labor
laws
even
though
the
state
policy
was
designed
only
to
adjust
relationships
in
the
world
of
commerce
and
completely
disregarded
labor
relations
implications.
so
here
in
this
case,
it
is
indisputable
that
national
labor
policy
authorizes
voluntary
compliance
with
"hot
cargo"
clauses
voluntarily
entered
into
prior
to
1959.
congress
not
only
failed
but
refused
to
distinguish
application
of
that
policy
in
the
field
of
transportation
from
its
application
in
other
fields.
this
court
decided
that
very
fact
in
a
very
famous
case,
amalgamated
versus
wisconsin
employment
relations
board.
and
in
that
case,
if
i
may
quote
just
one
paragraph
from
your
decision,
“no
distinction
between
public
utilities
and
national
manufacturing
organizations
has
been
drawn
in
the
administration
of
a
federal
act,
referring
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.”
and
when
separate
treatment
for
public
utilities
were
urged
on
congress
in
1947,
the
suggested
differentiation
was
expressly
rejected
by
congress.
and
in
a
footnote
in
the
amalgamated
case,
you
quote
that
situation.
you
bring
out
in
your
opinion
senator
taft's
remarks
about
voluntarism
in
collective
bargaining.
so
in
other
words,
congress
did
not
put
public
utilities
under
our
national
labor
policy
in
a
different
position.
the
non-public
utilities
didn't
put
common
carriers
in
a
different
position
than
non-common
carriers.
and
under
the
oliver
case,
when
it
applied
the
antitrust
laws,
under
the
valentine
act
of
ohio,
this
was
no
different
than
what
the
icc
was
doing
in
this
case.
the
effect
of
it
was
to
interfere
with
and
conflict
with
your
national
labor
policy.
so
here,
to
allow
the
commission
to
grant
certificates
because
of
temporary
stoppages
would
impair
the
freedom
of
unions
and
employers
in
the
transportation
industry
to
bargain
collectively
and
voluntarily
to
perform
their
valid
labor
contracts.
congress
refused
to
impose
different
restrictions
upon
public
utility
unions
and
employers
than
on
others
because
of
their
greater
impact
on
the
public
of
service
stoppages
resulting
from
public
utility
strikes.
therefore,
we
--
this
court
couldn't
allow
a
state
public
utility
commission
to
do
the
very
thing
the
icc
did
because
there
would
be
conflict
with
federal
policy
with
regard
to
labor
relations.
in
the
same
breadth,
you
couldn't
allow
one
agency
of
the
government,
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
to
interfere
with,
overlap,
conflict
with
another
congressional
policy
as
set
out
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
this
is
for
congress
to
determine
not
the
icc,
not
any
agency
of
the
federal
government.
here,
you
have
a
clash
of
perhaps
two
congressional
policies.
but
rather
than
that
type
of
a
clash,
you
got
a
clash
of
an
agency
meeting
head
on
with
the
congressional
policy
that
cannot
be
reconciled.
and
therein,
lies
the
danger
in
this
type
of
decision,
therein
lies
the
danger
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
entering
into
this
field.
now,
to
sustain
the
commission's
decision
in
this
respect,
it
would
be
necessary
to
hold
that
congress
by
imposing
upon
common
carriers,
duties
and
responsibilities
to
the
public,
but
have
to
curtail
the
freedom
to
enter
into
involuntarily
performed,
collective
bargaining
agreements
that
this
court
sustained
in
the
sand
door
case.
you
sustained
as
legal
under
taft-hartley
319
39,
"hot
cargo"
clauses
very
similar
to
the
one
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
pardon.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
thank
you.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
mr.
weinberg.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
one
of
an
employer
voluntarily
complying
as
distinguished
from
being
forced
by
strike
action
on
the
part
of
his
employees
to
comply
with
a
hot
cargo
clause
which
at
that
time
pre-1959
was
unquestionably
legal
and
so
decided
by
this
very
court
in
sand
door.
this
court
squarely
held
in
sand
door
that
national
labor
policy
leaves
all
employers,
including
employers
in
the
trucking
industry,
public
utility
employers,
free
voluntarily
to
perform
such
agreements.
the
question
here
then
is
whether
the
interstate
commerce
commission
can
make
that
conduct
which
national
labor
policy
allows
the
occasion
for
retribution
whether
in
the
form
of
withdrawal
of
a
carrier
certificate
or
licensing
a
competing
and
rival
carriers
happened
in
this
case.
now,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
says,
“it
is
not
punishing
the
carrier
for
voluntary
compliance.
it's
merely
assuring
service
to
the
public”
and
they
so
argued
in
their
brief.
but
the
short
answer
to
that
is
another
case
decided
by
this
very
court,
southern
steamship
versus
nlrb
and
this
court
admonished
the
national
labor
relations
board.
in
that
case,
not
to
take
a
single
minded
attitude,
and
in
the
words
of
this
court,
where
the
case
is
not
like
that
in
southern
steamship
company
versus
labor
board
where
the
board
was
admonished
not
to
apply
the
policies
of
its
statute,
that’s
the
national
labor
relations
act,
so
single
mindedly
as
to
ignore
other
equally
important
congressional
objectives
and
that’s
the
exact
situation
we
have
here.
the
icc
is
ignoring,
negating
if
you
please,
the
national
labor
policy
that
supports
collective
bargaining.
the
icc
in
effect
is
interfering
with
the
freedom
of
contract
for
a
lawful
clause,
voluntarily
entered
into
by
the
parties
and
this
is
an
exact
case
with
southern
steamship.
now,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
can
no
more
be
allowed
in
this
case
to
pursue
its
objective
of
providing
transportation
service
to
the
public
without
regard
to
the
effect
of
what
it
is
doing
on
congress’
labor
policy.
then
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
southern
steamship
could
be
allowed
to
pursue
its
policy
of
reinstating
strikers
without
regard
to
the
effect
of
what
it
was
doing
upon
congress’
mutiny
laws.
if
you
remember
in
southern
steamship,
the
board
ordered
reinstatement
of
strikers
on
a
ship.
at
the
same
time,
there
was
a
question
of
whether
--
by
engaging
in
a
strike
on
a
ship,
they
engaged
in
mutiny.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
they
didn't
take
the
--
well
--
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
they
weren't
cognize
--
their
whole
case,
their
whole
decision
rests
upon
the
labor
dispute.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
no,
but
they
must
be
mindful
of
the
congressional
policies
in
our
statutes.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
well,
i
think
the
very
decision
shows
that
they
weren't
mindful
when
the
very
basis
of
this
decision
was
the
labor
dispute
despite
their
protestation
to
the
opposite.
i
think
that's
very
aptly
set
out
in
the
examiner's
opinion,
one
of
the
trial
examiner's
opinion,
that
was
approved
by
the
icc
and
was
considered
by
it.
this
is
from
the
record,
page
96.
its
examiner
priscal's
finding
and
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
read
it
to
the
court.
i
think
it's
the
epitome
of
this
situation.
the
truck
line
carriers
have
union
contracts.
the
eastern
nebraska
carriers
are
for
the
most
parts
small
or
relatively
small
businessmen.
most
of
them
are
obviously
opposed
to
unionization
of
their
business.
this
commission
has
no
authority,
nor
means
of
solving
that
problem.
if
as
some
eastern
nebraska
carriers
imply,
the
national
labor
relations
board
does
not
offer
a
solution
to
that
problem
then
it
obviously
is
a
problem
for
the
legislative
branch
of
the
federal
government
that
only
the
federal
government
could
solve.
certainly,
this
commission
is
in
no
position
to
solve
it
and
that's
exactly
what
they
were
doing
in
this
case.
it
is
one
thing
for
the
commission
to
say
and
by
self-serving
declaration
we
are
not
considering
a
labor
dispute,
but
as
the
dissenting
judge
in
lower
court
said,
they
spent
countless
paragraphs
after
paragraph
detailing
the
labor
dispute.
judge
mercer
characterized
this
case
in
this
respect.
he
said,
“the
hardcore
of
this
case
is
the
labor
dispute.”
absent
the
labor
dispute,
we
wouldn't
be
up
here
today.
and
that's
where
they
impinge
upon
another
congressional
policy.
the
commission
has
been
somewhat
cautious
in
other
cases
with
regard
to
this.
it's
significant
to
note
mr.
justice
that
they
haven't
granted
any
certificates
to
any
other
carrier
where
there
have
been
labor
disputes.
they
didn't
do
it
in
galveston
and
their
answer
in
their
brief
and
in
that
case
was
that
that
labor
dispute
was
temporary.
it
was
settled
in
two
months,
but
it
doesn't
really
make
any
difference
from
the
principle
standpoint
whether
it's
two
months
or
eleven
months?
should
that
be
a
standard
to
be
adopted
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission?
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
we
recognize
that
in
some
instances,
they
can
act
independently
of
each
other.
each
has
a
separate
policy
to
perform
and
to
carry
out,
but
in
this
case,
you've
got
an
overlapping.
in
this
case,
you've
got
an
impingement,
an
injection
of
the
commission
into
a
labor
dispute
which
is
outside
of
their
congressional
policy.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
that's
what
they're
trying
to
say,
but
--
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
well
--
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
their
having
--
they
rely
upon
the
findings
of
the
trial
examiners
and
i
just
read
what
this
trial
examiner
said,
and
the
other
one
said
the
same
thing
practically.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
they
had
no
jurisdiction
in
this
particular
case
your
honor.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
and
we
agree
with
him.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
we
say
they
have
no
jurisdiction
in
this
particular
case
because
it
arose
of
a
--
out
of
a
labor
matter.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
we
don't
--
we
do
not
object
to
the
trial
examiner's
findings.
we're
here
objecting
to
the
majority
opinion
of
the
lower
court
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
taking
those
findings,
adopting
them
and
then
deciding
that
they're
not
considering
a
labor
dispute.
we
think
the
hardcore
of
this
matter
is
the
labor
dispute.
the
government
in
its
brief
has
admitted
that
the
--
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
we
say
they
have.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
yes,
we
say
they
have.
and
they
negated
certain
rights
of
the
parties,
the
right
of
the
employer
of
freedom
of
contract,
the
right
of
the
employees
to
bargain
collectively.
what
they
are
in
effect
taking
away
from
both
the
employer
and
the
employee
are
rights
guaranteed
to
the
employees
and
the
employer
by
the
national
labor
policy.
that's
what
they're
doing
in
effect
by
this
decision.
that's
what
we
object
to.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
yes.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
that's
one
of
the
arguments
and
that's
the
montgomery
ward
case
mr.
justice
goldberg.
that's
what
they
did
in
the
montgomery
ward
case,
but
in
the
galveston
case
--
the
montgomery
ward
case,
they
turned
down
the
parties
because
of
a
labor
dispute.
this
court
has
admonished
the
icc
to
be
cautious
in
considering
these
problems.
we
say
that
the
icc
perhaps
acted
without
caution
in
this
case.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
situation
--
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
i
don't
--
that
that
would
be
analogous
of
the
situation.
here,
they
are
granting
a
new
certificate
because
of
a
labor
dispute.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
well,
the
record
doesn't
bear
that
out
entirely
as
mr.
axelrod
argued
yesterday.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
yes,
but
the
examiners
in
their
findings
didn't
find
that
completely.
one
of
the
examiners
found
that
it
wasn't
so
inadequate
but
my
argument
doesn't
go
to
that
particular
portion
of
this
case.
my
argument
is
this
that
the
icc
has
embarked
upon
a
dangerous
precedent,
a
novel
situation
in
granting
rights
to
a
carrier,
to
a
new
carrier
in
setting
up
rival
competing
carriers
because
of
a
labor
dispute,
because
of
activity
on
the
part
of
other
carriers
that
is
a
protected
and
guaranteed
activity
under
the
national
labor
policy.
and
i
think
the
icc
was
very
careful
in
the
galveston
case
which
this
court
spoke
about
in
the
sand
door
situation.
the
icc
was
very
cautious
and
they
said
the
strike
had
been
settled.
the
labor
dispute
had
been
settled
before
the
hearing.
well,
in
this
case,
you
didn't
have
the
labor
dispute
settled
before
the
hearing
and
we
must
recognize
that
every
labor
dispute
is
temporary.
they're
not
a
permanent
situation,
but
what
the
icc
has
embarked
upon
is
a
permanent
situation.
for
example,
suppose
they
transfer
--
the
nebraska
short
line
carriers
should
transfer
these
rights
their
transferable
subject
to
icc
approval
and
the
very
basis
is
taken
away.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
no,
it
doesn't
mr.
justice.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
well
--
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
yes.
i
would
say
that
it
has
been
terminated
and
in
that
respect,
i'd
like
to
bring
up
one
other
fact
in
this
situation.
one
of
the
stockholder
carriers
of
nebraska
short
line
carriers
had
a
strike
over
wage
rates,
hours
and
conditions
of
employment.
some
of
the
carrier
stockholders
had
no
labor
dispute
at
all
and
some
were
involved
in
the
hot
cargo
situation.
so
in
this
situation,
you've
got
a
strike
for
wages,
you've
got
a
hot
cargo
situation,
and
you've
got
some
of
the
people
who
are
getting
these
rights
who
didn't
have
any
labor
dispute
at
all,
who
didn't
have
any
interruption
of
service
to
speak
of.
the
labor
dispute,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think,
has
been
terminated.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
no,
they
are
not,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
i
know
of,
but
they
are
subject
to
be
an
organized
buying.
now
what
happens
if
they
get
organized
and
they
sign
a
contract
similar
to
what
the
other
carriers
have
signed?
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
the
power
of
the
icc
would
be
revocation.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
of
the
certificate
of
the
carrier
that
had
refused
to
render
service.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
what
--
and
they
would
compel
in
to
serve
first
and
in
the
event
of
failure
to
serve,
then
their
certificate
would
be
subject
to
revocation.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
--
may
i
answer
that
question
this
way.
i
take
a
different
position
than
mr.
axelrod
on
this.
i
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
grant
him
temporary
rights,
whether
they
use
the
complaint
procedure,
or
whether
they
grant
him
permanent
rights,
the
icc
is
resolving
a
labor
dispute
by
any
act.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
i
say
that
they
could
file
the
complaint
and
the
icc
should
consider
it.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
i
think
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
because
the
principle
is
the
same
in
my
opinion.
mr.
axelrod
does
not
agree
with
me
on
this
and
that
--
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
--
therein
lies
our
difference
or
one
of
them.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
yes
there
is
a
difference.
although
i
have
set
out
in
my
brief
that
they
should
have
followed
the
complaint
procedure,
in
my
opinion,
if
they
followed
the
complaint
procedure,
the
question
of
the
labor
dispute
would
have
been
squarely
presented
to
the
icc,
like
it
was
in
montgomery
ward.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
yes.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
i
will
say
this.
i
am
really
not
changing.
i
am
attempting
to
be
consistent
in
my
argument
on
the
power
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
well,
i
think
that
there
is
a
consistency
to
this
argument
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
because
i'm
arguing
the
power
to
resolve
the
labor
dispute
whether
it'd
be
by
any
of
these
procedures,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
i
think
this
is
a
question
that
congress
has
to
answer
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
but
i
--
what
would
be
--
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
i'd
say
that
they
have
all
the
rights
in
the
world
to
regulate
and
to
see
that
the
national
transportation
policy
is
performed,
but
in
the
field
of
labor
disputes
there
is
a
great
question.
this
came
up
in
the
montgomery
ward
case
and
they
denied
relief
to
carriers
who
weren't
served.
suppose,
mr.
chief
justice,
just
for
our
discussion
that
you
had
a
situation
--
that
you
had
a
situation
where
you
had
a
wage
dispute
and
no
service
could
be
given
in
any
area
just
like
the
telegrapher's
strike
against
the
chicago
northwestern
railroad.
suppose
it
was
impracticable
for
a
carrier
to
perform
because
of
a
strike,
a
lawful
legal
strike
in
which
its
employees
was
engaged,
that
is
the
area
that
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
but
--
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
i
don't
think
it's
frustrated.
i
think
it
has
to
recognize
this
problem.
i
think
that
it
cannot
impinge
upon
another
congressional
objective
and
policy.
the
icc
has
no
jurisdiction
to
protect
the
public
against
inconvenience
arising
out
of
labor
disputes.
to
the
extent
that
congress
wanted
the
public
protected
against
such
an
inconvenience,
it
gave
the
job
to
the
federal
mediation
and
conciliation
service
and
the
national
labor
relations
board,
not
the
icc.
for
example,
there's
the
80-day
cooling
off
period
for
national
strikes
that
affect
a
wide
area.
there's
the
service
of
the
federal
mediation
and
conciliation
service
to
settle
these
matters.
mr.
david
d.
weinberg
thank
you
very
much.
