justice
william
o.
douglas
if
there'd
been
a
--
a
complaint
filed
under
complaint
section,
what
power
would
the
icc
have?
justice
william
o.
douglas
revocation
of
what?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
they
could
have
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
if
the
icc
acted
under
the
complaint
provision,
you
would
be
here
arguing
the
same
you
are
--
as
you
are
today.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
had
no
business
interfering
with
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
--
you
answered
the
question
i
was
going
to
ask
you
next.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
it
would
be
a
futile
road
to
follow
by
your
argument.
