mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
summarize
first
briefly
some
of
the
elements
of
proof
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
on
which
the
commission
acted
in
this
case.
under
our
theory
of
the
case,
if
the
commission's
findings
as
to
public
convenience
and
necessity
were
not
supported
by
conventional
elements
of
proof
then
the
court
does
not
get
to
the
other
question
which
had
been
discussed
at
such
length.
as
you've
been
told,
the
stockholders
of
short
lines,
to
whom
the
commission
issued
a
certificate,
are
small
carriers
in
central
and
eastern
nebraska.
and
much
of
their
business
is
transporting
freight
from
points
in
central
and
eastern
nebraska,
to
and
from
omaha
where
it
is
interlined
with
the
larger
interstate
carriers
for
transportation
to
and
from
the
larger
distribution
centers
such
as
chicago.
these
stockholder
carriers
serve
a
number
of
towns
in
central
and
eastern
nebraska
which
are
not
served
in
regular
service
by
any
other
carriers.
for
example,
clark,
one
of
the
12
stockholder
carriers
alone
serves
12
communities
which
are
solely
dependent
upon
him
for
regular
motor
common
carrier
service.
in
1954,
the
teamsters
union
sought
to
organize
the
employees
of
the
12
stockholder
carriers.
and
without
going
into
details
of
that,
by
the
beginning
of
may
in
1956,
as
the
commission
found
as
result
of
the
interstate
carriers'
compliance
with
their
hot
cargo
clauses
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreements.
as
the
commission
found
in
early
may,
1956,
certain
of
the
stockholder
carriers
began
to
experience
difficulty
in
affecting
normal
interchange
arrangements
with
a
larger
line
haul
carriers
with
whom
they
have
been
doing
business.
this
difficulty
was
experienced
primarily
at
omaha.
and
consistent
of
the
refusal
of
many
of
the
larger
carriers
to
accept
outbound
shipments,
their
refusal
to
turnover
to
the
stockholder
carriers'
inbound
shipments
which
were
either
routed
by
shippers
over
the
stockholder
carriers
or
which
normally
would
have
been
turned
over
to
them
for
delivery
to
the
interior
nebraska
points
which
they
regularly
served.
the
commission
while
finding
that
the
stockholder
carriers
at
no
time
experienced
a
complete
shut
off
in
interchange
service
at
omaha.
and
while
further
finding
that
burlington
truck
lines
and
santa
fe
truck
line
attempted
to
maintain
service
which
i'd
like
to
discuss
later,
characterized
the
situation
as
far
as
transportation
service
was
concerned
as
follows
in
the
record
at
page
116.
the
breakdown
in
interchange
arrangements
at
omaha
between
the
unionized
carriers
and
the
stockholder
carriers,
and
the
refusal
of
the
unionized
carrier
to
provide
pick
up
and
delivery
service
at
establishments
where
picket
lines
had
been
established,
has
resulted
in
a
substantial
disruption
in
motor
service
to
a
large
portion
of
the
nebraska
shipping
public.
the
nature
of
the
impact
upon
shippers
was
described
by
the
commission
as
follows
at
page
107.
as
a
result
of
the
breakdown
of
interchange
arrangements
at
omaha,
shippers
at
interior
nebraska
points
had
experienced
delays
in
the
movement
of
their
outbound
shipments
to
destination
and
consignees
at
such
points
have
experienced
delays,
inconveniences,
and
unforeseen
expense
distributable
to
the
failure
of
the
originating
carriers
to
--
in
effect
to
maintain
adequate
interchange
service
at
omaha.
there
was
really
no
dispute
about
what
happened
in
terms
of
service
to
shippers.
at
page
3
of
the
reply
brief,
the
appellant
carriers
admit,
and
i'll
--
frankly,
i'm
taking
a
bit
out
of
their
context,
but
they
admit
that
many
shippers
in
the
area
suffered
aggravating
delays
in
the
delivery
of
their
shipments.
now,
the
commission
further
found
that
these
difficulties
which
began
in
may,
1956,
were
continuing
to
be
experienced
up
to
and
including
the
date
of
the
hearing,
and
by
that,
the
commission
was
referring
to
the
hearing
on
the
second
application
which
began
on
april
4,
1957.
in
other
words,
by
that
time,
the
deterioration
in
the
interchange
at
omaha
had
persistent
for
11
months.
again,
the
commission
did
not
find
that
there
was
a
complete
cessation
of
interchange,
a
complete
breakdown
of
service.
in
candor,
i
must
point
out
that
the
record
shows
that
shipments
did
eventually
move
somehow.
now,
to
rebut
this
finding
of
deficiencies,
in
the
service
to
shippers,
the
appellant
carriers
do
primarily
two
things.
first,
they
refer
to
the
commission's
finding
and
i
quote,
“that
at
no
time
has
the
boycott
against
the
stockholder
carriers
been
completely
effective
in
that
at
no
time
has
interchanged
with
a
larger
unionized
carriers
then
completely
shut
off.”
for
example,
burlington
truck
lines
and
santa
fe
which
are
rail
subsidiaries,
a
period
of
accepted
interline
traffic
from
the
stockholder
carriers
more
or
less
regularly
and
to
have
generally
maintained
a
normal
interline
relationships
to
them.
and
then
from
this,
the
appellant
say,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
the
available
physical
capacity
of
burlington
and
santa
fe
could
not
have
taken
care
of
all
of
all
of
the
traffic
involved.
now,
we
don't
think
the
record
quite
shows
that.
to
begin
with,
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
nobody
in
this
whole
proceeding
of
this
litigation
has
disputed
the
adequacy
of
the
physical
capacity,
physical
transportation
capacity
of
the
large
interstate
carrier
serving
omaha.
the
question
has
been
whether
it
was
sufficiently
made
available
to
shippers
but
the
physical
capacity
is
there.
however,
the
commission
also
adapted
the
finding
of
examiner
discovery
about
the
santa
fe
and
burlington
service.
he
said,
there's
no
doubt
that
some
carriers
like
burlington
and
santa
fe
accepted
traffic
but
even
those
carriers
did
not
maintain
the
same
free
and
open
interchange
service
in
effect
before
may
1956.
in
many
or
most
instances,
the
interchange
traffic
had
to
be
handled
at
the
terminal
by
a
supervisory
personnel
because
the
employees
normally
are
handling
such
traffic
wouldn't
touch
it.
now
we
submit
that
the
commission
was
not
required
to
consider
the
physical
capacity
of
burlington
and
santa
fe
where
the
availability
of
that
capacity,
the
shippers
was
measured
by
the
cargo
handling
capacity
of
supervisory
personnel.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
there
is
scattered
evidence
to
the
effect,
not
a
great
deal.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
overall
result
of
the
service
being
rendered,
including
that
of
burlington
and
santa
fe
was
that
there
were
significant
delays
in
delivering.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
know
of
only
one
or
two
specific
instances
in
the
record
indicating
that
there
were
delays.
for
example
on
one
occasion
the
traffic
result
if
the
burlington
and
at
that
point,
they
declined
it,
later
in
the
day
they
called
back
and
said,
“bring
it
over.”
now,
that's
not
very
massive
evidence.
i'll
admit.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
certainly
burlington
and
santa
fe
to
give
him
credit,
attempted
to
provide
service
through
utilizing
the
supervisory
personnel.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
my
understanding
of
it
sir.
and
so
far
as
i
know,
burlington
and
santa
fe
did
not
run
into
a
strike
because
they
utilized
their
supervisory
personnel
for
this.
and
in
support
of
their
contention,
the
appellee
carriers'
contention
that
the
interruption
of
interchange
were
so
transitory
as
to
preclude
the
authorization
of
the
new
service,
they
state
both
in
their
brief
and
in
their
oral
argument
yesterday
that
about
april
3,
1957,
watson
truck,
and
independent,
some
of
the
larger
carriers
resumed
service.
now,
that
statement
is
inaccurate.
it's
based
upon
the
finding
of
examiner
gresco
in
the
record
at
page
94
and
95.
and
he
said
and
i
quote,
“for
business
reasons,
some
of
the
principal
omaha
carriers
like
watson
brothers
and
so
on,
declared
that
a
new
policy
have
been
adopted
about
april
3,
1957.
that
management
policy
is
to
the
effect
that
serious
and
persistent
attempts
will
be
made
to
interchange
freely
and
normally
at
omaha.”
it
was
explained
that
where
picket
lines
exist,
there
might
still
be
difficulties
in
interchanging
traffic
in
normal
fashion.
and
the
examiner
concluded,
this
was
his
opinion,
not
binding
upon
the
commission,
all
fair
indications
are
that
under
the
leadership
of
these
large
and
progressive
carriers,
other
omaha
truck
line
carriers
will
strive
to
restore
normal
interchange.
we
think
that
--
we
submit
that
the
commission
was
not
required
to
assume
that
this
new
policy
of
attempts
would
be
a
decisive
factor
in
eliminating
service
deficiencies
which
had
already
been
continuing
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
of
this
announced
new
policy
of
attempts
would
not
be
a
decisive
factor
in
restoring
service
deficiencies
which
had
been
continuing
for
11
months.
we
--
i
would
also
emphasize
that
this
new
policy
is
formulated
about
april
3.
now,
that's
on
the
eve
of
the
hearing
in
the
second
application
which
was
to
begin
and
did
begin
on
april
4.
now,
the
court
below
pointed
out
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
acting
upon
applications
for
new
service,
often
finds
that
coincident
with
the
filing
of
the
application
existing
motor
carriers
start
to
provide
or
offer
to
provide
better
service
to
more
shippers.
and
then
that
is
common
place
in
the
commission's
work.
as
the
court
below
said,
“the
commission
is
not
required
to
be
at
decisive
length
to
such
a
related
zeal
to
serve
the
public.”
briefly,
it's
undisputed
that
during
an
11-month
period
preceding
the
second
hearing,
there
was
a
sufficient
interruption
in
interchange
at
omaha
to,
in
the
words
of
the
appellant
carriers
in
their
reply
brief,
to
subject
many
shippers
to
aggravating
delays
in
the
deliveries.
now,
under
the
standards
applied
by
the
commission
in
hundreds
of
cases,
sustained
by
this
court,
the
commission
was
warranted
in
these
facts
to
find
that
the
present
and
future
public
convenience
and
necessity
by
conventional
standards
warranted
the
establishment
to
the
authorization
of
a
new
service
tailored
to
the
needs
of
the
situation.
here,
the
commission
granted
only
a
fraction
of
the
authority
requested
by
short
lines.
short
lines
in
effect
asked
for
the
world
on
a
platter.
one
of
their
applications
was
to
serve
between
omaha
on
the
one
hand
and
points
in
32
states
in
the
other
hand.
they
didn't
get
it.
on
an
analysis
of
shipper
needs
and
service
deficiencies,
they
got
only
the
authority
to
serve
omaha
on
the
list
and
the
distribution
centers
of
chicago,
kansas
city
and
st.
louis
on
the
east,
limited
in
both
directions
to
shipments
originating
in
or
destined
to
alaska
--
toward
nebraska.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
under
section
210
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
commission
may
authorize
temporary
operations
for
not
more
than
180
days.
it
may
under
section
9
(b)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
under
this
court's
decision
of
the
pan-atlantic
steamship
company
case,
it
may
extend
that
temporary
authority
for
more
than
180
days
during
the
pendency
of
an
application
for
permanent
operating
authority.
the
suggestion
was
made
yesterday
as
i
recall
it
that
the
commission
could
have
issued
a
temporary
authority
during
the
pendency
of
an
investigation
under
section
204
(c)
to
determine
whether
a
cease-and-desist
order
should
issue.
that
statement
is
not
accurate.
however,
the
commission
has
no
authority
to
issue
a
temporary
authority
beyond
the
180-day
period
merely
because
the
pendency
of
an
investigation
under
section
204
(c).
and
of
course
under
his
contention,
we
would
have
no
more
business
to
issue
a
temporary
authority
than
we
would
have
to
issue
a
permanent
authority
or
a
temporary
--
or
a
cease-and-desist
order.
under
the
position
that
all
the
consequences
flowing
out
of
these
facts
are
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
national
relations
board,
as
mr.
weinberg
contends,
then
that
would
mean,
it
must
mean
that
the
commission
would
be
totally
precluded
from
using
any
of
the
tools
available
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
issue
a
service
to
charge.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
by
the
complaint
procedure,
they
may
mean
one
or
both
of
two
things.
section
212
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
provides
a
very
difficult,
almost
never
used
procedure
for
the
revocation
of
motor
carrier
certificates.
it's
available
only
if,
first,
the
commission
after
a
hearing
proceeding
under
section
204
(c),
issues
an
order
to
the
carrier
to
perform
its
duty,
to
a
particular
duty
whether
under
the
statute
or
under
a
commission
regulation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
secondly
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
justice,
one
could
argue
at
some
logic
that
would
be
even
more
directly
involved,
because
if
the
commission
perceive
as
to
it,
to
issue
a
cease-and-desist
order
against
these
carriers,
telling
them
effect
not
to
honor
the
hot
cargo
clause.
they're
arguing
the
conflict
is
much
more
direct
than
the
alleged
conflict
here.
what
is
the
--
what
did
the
commission
do
here?
it
didn't
tell
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
technically,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
is
true,
but
i
would
have
to
admit
that
as
a
practical
matter,
that
if
a
com
--
that
if
a
carrier
were
going
to
comply
with
such
an
order
in
effective
commercially
realistic
sense,
it
would
have
to
force
its
employees
to
handle
cargo.
i
mean,
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
effective
--
it
would
have
to
force
its
employees
to
handle
the
shipments.
effective
practical
transportation
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
of
the
type
which
provides
adequate
service
to
shippers
just
isn't
performed
as
a
practical
matter
by
utilizing
supervisory
employees
only
to
handle
the
freight.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
might
have
happened
but
that
isn't
what
we
did.
all
we
said
here
was
to
carriers,
since
you
won't
perform
the
service,
we'll
authorize
somebody
to
perform
it
who
had
said
--
who
was
willing
to
do
it
and
we
say
that
that
approach
more
than
any
other
kept
the
commission
out
of
any
area
of
overlap
to
the
labor
board,
kept
it
furthest
removed
from
the
labor
dispute.
the
alternatives
suggested
by
the
appellants,
arguably
at
least,
would
have
subjected
the
commission
into
the
dispute.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
the
second
stage,
it
would
be,
if
the
carrier
refused
to
comply
with
the
cease-and-desist
order
then
the
commission
could
--
after
a
fur
--
after
a
second
hearing,
it
would
determine
that
the
violation
was
willful,
revoked
the
carrier
certificates.
needless
to
say,
these
remedy
of
revocation
of
carrier
certificates
is
suggested
by
the
union
and
not
by
the
appellant
carriers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
sure.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct,
sir,
even
if
it
goes
on
for
two
or
three
years.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
suppose.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
commission
did
issue
a
temporary
authority
early
in
the
history
of
this
matter.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
it
would've
expired
at
the
end
of
180
days,
except
for
the
pendency
of
the
application
for
permanent
authority.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
no,
because
if
the
commission
had
denied
the
application
of
a
permanent
authority
then
the
temporary
authority
would
have
expired.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
deliberately?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
there
are
some
doubts
as
to
the
propriety
of
doing
that
mr.
justice
because
this
temporary
authority
is
--
power
is
an
exception
from
the
general
convenience
and
necessity
standards
of
the
act.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
then
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
of
course,
sir.
a
set
of
facts
can
have
two
or
three
sets
of
circumstances
and
it'd
be
naïve
for
me
to
say
that
the
commission's
action
in
granting
a
certificate
here
did
not
have
or
might
not
have
some
impact
upon
the
labor
situation
out
there.
now,
the
commission
was
not
evaluating
its
actions
in
terms
of
what
the
consequences
would
be
in
labor
relations.
it
was
applying
as
it
felt
it
was
its
duty
to
do,
only
to
conventional
standards
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
meet
admitted
deficiencies
in
service
to
shippers.
it
did
not
purport
to
evaluate
what
impact
that
action
might
at
some
later
date
have
--
it
have
upon
labor
problems
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
really
it's
not
[inaudible].
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
commission
did
not
have
available
such
a
choice
of
remedies.
it
did
not
have
available
any
remedy
for
the
--
for
this
--
to
meet
--
by
which
it
could
meet
shipper's
needs
that
wouldn't
have
an
impact
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
or
potential
impact
upon
the
labor
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
for
example,
if
the
commission
had
issued
a
cease-and-desist
order
to
the
interstate
carriers,
directing
them
to
render
service
notwithstanding
their
hot
cargo
clauses,
arguably,
hat
would
have
a
more
direct
--
amount
to
a
more
direct
interjection
into
the
--
into
the
labor
relations
area.
the
only
other
remedy
as
suggested
by
the
appellants
is
the
very
drastic
sanction
of
revocation
of
certificates
in
which
the
--
on
which
the
interstate
carriers
in
reliance
upon
which
they
have
invested
millions
of
dollars
in
equipment
and
terminals.
that
would
be
like
throwing
an
atomic
bomb
into
a
local
situation,
revocation
of
the
carrier
certificates.
so
the
choice
was,
only
they
were
then
arguing
distance
was
to
authorize
a
careful
retailer,
the
additional
service
as
it
did
here
or
to
more
directly
interject
itself
into
the
labor
management
area
by
a
cease-and-desist
order
which
in
effect
would
be
telling
the
carriers
don't
honor
your
court
--
your
hot
cargo
clauses.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
may
i
--
may
i
answer
you
at
some
length
as
to
why
that
--
why
is
that
inherent
in
the
situation,
why
the
commission
did
not
proceed
by
a
cease-and-desist
order.
first,
by
way
of
context
and
this
is
an
important
context,
in
a
wide
variety
of
situations,
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
cases,
the
commission
has
dealt
with
demonstrated
inadequacies
in
the
sources
of
existing
carriers
by
authorizing
an
additional
service.
as
the
court
below
instinctively
recognize
in
its
opinion,
the
commission
has
proceeded
that
way
from
the
beginning
for
two
reasons.
it
conserves
its
administrative
resources.
it
doesn't
have
the
resources
to
please
carrier
service
performance
around
the
country.
we
don't
attempt
to
and
secondly,
it
provides
the
spur
of
competition.
and
as
i
say,
that
is
our
approach
--
has
been
the
commission's
approach
in
dealing
with
service
inadequacies
in
thousands
of
cases,
not
just
this.
it's
hard
to
think
of
a
situation
in
which
the
commission
has
dealt
with
the
demonstrative
service
inadequacy
by
existing
carriers
who
have
the
authority
by
telling
them
through
a
cease-and-desist
order
to
meet
the
service
need.
secondly,
when
a
proceeding
starts
out
like
this,
the
applicant
applying
for
certificate
in
the
existing
carriers
protesting,
i'm
quite
sure
that
that
proceeding
can't
go
off
like
this
and
result
in
the
issuance
of
a
cease-and-desist
order
against
the
existing
carriers,
unless
at
some
point
there's
been
a
formal
notice
given
that
such
--
that
such
an
order
may
be
the
result
of
proceeding
and
by
that
time,
the
proceeding
might
be
very
far
advanced
indeed.
and
finally,
proceeding
by
cease-and-desist
order
and
only
--
only
by
cease-and-desist
order
means
that
the
commission
cannot
provide
for
immediate
service
needs
by
temporary
authority
for
more
than
a
180
days.
they
can
issue
a
temporary
authority
for
a
hundred
--
more
than
180
days
only
while
it
is
determining
and
acting
upon
an
application
for
temporary
authority.
now,
that
may
sound
sort
of
awkward
mechanically
but
that
is
the
structure
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
moreover
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
the
commission
would
not
evaluate
the
causes
of
the
labor
dispute.
it
would
not
leave
them
with
such
a
remedy
overnight
or
it's
just
a
relatively
brief
interruption
of
service.
in
the
commission's
approach,
while
happily,
we
haven't
had
much
experience
with
this
type
of
thing
but
it
is
illustrated
both
by
this
case
and
the
galveston
application
which
it
decided
on
the
same
day
as
this
case.
the
galveston
truck
lines
asked
for
a
certificate
arising
out
of
the
same
type
of
situation,
a
breakdown
and
interchange
with
other
carriers
by
who
--
that
were
--
who
are
honoring
their
hot
cargo
clauses.
that
interruption
of
service
lasted
only
two
months
and
that
it
ended
several
months
before
the
application
for
the
certificate
was
filed
to
the
commission.
the
commission
said,
“we
aren't
going
to
grant
any
certificate
under
these
facts.”
but
that
was
in
contrast
to
this
case,
and
this
case
involved
an
11-month
interruption
in
service
which
was
continued
at
the
time
of
the
record
before
the
commission
was
closed.
so
by
--
so
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
under
your
facts,
if
that
interruption
to
the
ship
--
of
the
service
to
the
shipping
public
had
continued
for
11
months,
i
must
assume
that
the
commission
would
take
the
same
action.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
only
answer
to
that
is
that
these
matters
have
to
come
to
an
end
to
be
settled
sometime.
the
commission
held
two
long
hearings
before
hearing
the
examiners,
the
entire
commission
held
oral
argument,
entire
commission
report,
petitions
for
reconsideration.
i
think
it
was
enough
that
the
commission
did
not
act
except
upon
a
showing
of
serious
service
interruption
of
11
months
and
continue
at
the
time
of
hearing.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
11
months
is
the
longest
such
situation
the
commission
has
encountered.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
the
time
of
--
as
of
the
--
as
of
the
time
of
the
grant,
i'm
not
sure,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
of
the
time
of
the
record,
the
hearing
record
was
closed
[inaudible]
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
there
were
a
couple
earlier
-
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
--
it
has
done
so.
it
has
issued
temporary
authority
in
a
number
of
such
situations
through
the
years.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
it's
not
necessarily
against
the
labor.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
for
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
for
example,
the
three
years
--
i
think
it
was
about
three
years
ago,
a
number
of
the
larger
motor
carriers
on
the
west
coast
engaged
in
a
lockout
as
part
of
their
collective
bargaining
problems.
and
the
commission
did
not
hesitate
to
authorize
--
to
grant
temporary
authorities
to
various
small
carriers
not
involved
in
the
lockout
to
hold
food
stuff
and
perishable
commodities.
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
in
response
to
your
question
sir,
the
commission
has
repeatedly
asserted
power
to
issue
temporary
authorities
to
meet
an
urgent
need
for
service
which
resulted
from
a
labor
dispute
of
one
kind
or
another.
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
it
has
asserted
the
power
to
issue
a
--
to
grant
a
permanent
authority.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
would
agree.
i
would
agree
entirely.
i
think
the
way
the
commission
handled
this
case
and
the
companion
galveston
case
indicates
its
acute
awareness
of
that.
the
galveston
case,
shorter
interruption
of
service,
already
terminated.
the
commission
--
the
commission
denied
the
application.
here,
the
only
case
in
which
it
has
granted
such
a
permanent
authority,
interruption
and
interchange,
interruption
and
service,
11
months
contending
through
the
date
of
hearing.
it's
the
first
time
the
commission
had
encountered
such
a
set
of
facts
and
hopefully
it
will
not
encounter
very
often
in
the
future.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
commission
assumed
that
they
were.
it
did
not
purport
to
determine
whether
they
were
lawful
or
unlawful.
i
think
i
would
be
authorized
to
say
that
the
commission
would
regard
itself
as
not
competent
to
pass
upon
such
matters.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
indeed.
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
the
correct
posture
of
the
case.
the
commission
did
not
purport
to
evaluate
the
conduct
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
of
employers
or
union.
it
purported
only
to
apply
conventional
standards
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
in
looking
only
to
--
how
to
meet
shipper's
needs
solely
to
that.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh!
i
think
i
have
to
say
yes,
because
in
the
companion
galveston
case
in
denying
the
application,
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
given
by
the
commission.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
this
proceeding
has
been
pending
between
the
commission
and
the
courts
from
1956
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
up
to
the
present
time.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
entered
--
justice
stewart
asked
the
same
question
and
i
said
i
did
not
recall
just
what
the
timing
was.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh!
i
would
suppose
so,
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
do
not
in
fact
know.
i
have
been
told
it
is
not
in
the
record,
that
gradually
the
service
--
interchange
service
was
resumed
and
at
the
present
time,
it's
back
to
what
it
was
before
1956.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
and
it
was
not
very
extensive.
i
think
i
can
find
it
quickly
where,
on
page
101
of
the
record.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
so,
at
the
time
of
the
hearings
herein,
one
share
of
preferred
stock
had
been
issued
and
there
had
been
issued
and
paid
for
in
cash
$37,500
in
common
stock.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
would
be
the
implication
of
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
in
--
for
example,
on
page
27
in
reference
to
planters
nut
and
chocolate
company
v.
american
transfer.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
planters
nut
and
chocolate
company
v.
american
transfer
company.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
it
was
sort
of
a
tangled
situation
and
one
of
them
illustrates
the
problem
which
is
inherent
in
trying
to
--
proceed
by
section
204
(c).
as
that
proceeding
develops,
some
of
the
service
was
restored
and
then
another
thing
happened
which
shows
the
weakness
of
the
204
(c)
remedy.
some
of
the
carriers
simply
cancelled
their
tariffs
which
provided
for
inter
--
provided
for
interchange
through-routes
and
joint
rates.
in
other
words,
the
commission
can
proceed
through
a
long
hearing,
a
long
contested
proceeding
and
issue
a
cease-and-desist
order.
at
that
point,
the
carriers
are
free
to
do
this.
they
can
refuse
to
interline
service
at
--
through
--
at
joint
rates
because
under
part
ii
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
distinguished
from
part
i
dealing
with
railroads,
the
commission
cannot
require
motor
common
carriers
of
freight
to
enter
into
it
through-routes
and
joint
rates
with
each
other.
they
have
this
through-route
and
joint
rate
arrangements.
that
is
only
a
matter
of
choice.
it's
embodied
in
their
tariffs.
so
when
the
commission
finally
issued
a
cease-and-desist
order
and
was
sustained
by
the
courts,
the
carriers
can
simply
change
those
tariffs
at
which
point
their
obligation
will
be
limited
to
moving
freight
on
their
own
bills
of
lading
over
their
own
lines
and
at
the
local
rate.
the
result
will
be
almost
invariably
service
at
the
higher
rates,
a
combination
of
local
rates,
instead
of
a
normal
interchange
service
on
a
single
bill
of
lading
at
a
normally
lower
joint
rate.
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
was
happening
to
shippers
in
this
case
in
central
nebraska.
when
the
stuff
did
move,
it
often
moved
like
this.
the
inbound
shipments
would
be
transferred
by
the
--
by
the
interstate
carrier
to
a
railroad
at
omaha
and
be
delivered
by
rail,
usually
with
delays
to
the
interior
point.
but
how
did
it
move?
it
moved
at
a
combination
of
the
inbound
motor
carrier
rate
to
omaha
and
the
local
rail
rate
from
omaha
to
the
interior
point.
that
can
range
from
25%
to
50%
to
100%
higher
than
the
--
through
motor
carrier
joint
rate.
so
the
--
that
the
planters
nut
case
shows
one
of
the
inherent
defects
in
trying
to
restore
adequate
service
to
a
cease-and-desist
order,
because
by
the
time
you
get
to
the
end
of
that
road,
the
carrier
is
free
as
a
matter
of
law
to
cease
participating
in
a
through-service
at
a
single
bill
of
lading
and
at
joint
rates.
now,
as
to
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
there
is
no
indication
that
the
commission
gave
any
consideration
to
that
statement
and
i
hope
it
never
did.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
is
in
the
record
at
the
hearing
that
the
applicant
was
making
such
statements.
the
commission
as
far
--
the
commission
has
never
and
i'm
sure
would
never
issue
any
certificate
condition
upon
the
union
or
nonunion
carrier
or
the
applicant
or
the
contents
of
its
collective
bargaining
agreements.
and
there's
not
the
slightest
indication
of
the
commission's
report
that
it
paid
the
slightest
bit
of
attention
to
such
--
to
that
window
dressing
from
the
applicant.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
depending
upon
how
that
is
interpreted
and
applied
by
the
commission
and
by
the
courts.
it
seems
to
me
that
may
well
be
so.
we've
--
in
our
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
would
suggest
that
is
not
a
consideration
as
to
how
you
decide
this
case
on
the
merits.
i
think
it
does
relate
to
the
probable
frequencies
of
the
commission
in
taking
this
sort
of
action
in
the
future.
certainly,
the
griffin-landrum
amendment
seems
to
add
something
new
to
the
law.
i
would
like
to
avoid
offering
any
interpretation
of
it.
i
am
committed
to
yield
the
balance
of
my
time
to
fellow
counsel.
thank
you.
