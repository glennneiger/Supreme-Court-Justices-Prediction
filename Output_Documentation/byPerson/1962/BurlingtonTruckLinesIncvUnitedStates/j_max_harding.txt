mr.
j.
max
harding
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
may
--
i
would
like
to
tell
you
just
a
little
bit
about
the
background
of
this
proceeding
and
what
precipitated
the
application,
its
all
in
the
record.
however,
i
think
the
local
situation
is
important
as
to
determine
the
election
of
remedies
that
we
sought
here.
i
had
represented
many
of
these
small
drastic
carriers
for
some
years
and
as
the
record
shows,
they
are
quite
small.
some
of
them
have
four
or
maybe
five
trucks,
clark
being
the
largest
by
far
with
some
40
trucks,
but
on
a
national
scale,
they
are
very
small
carriers.
and
for
instance,
one
of
them
fremont
express'
gross
revenue
for
a
year
was
just
about
$20,000.
so
you
can
see
that
they
have
very
limited
financial
means
or
financial
facility.
now,
we
filed
this
application
actually
as
a
joint
enterprise
for
the
obvious
reason
that
no
single
one
of
them
could
have
afforded
to
go
into
a
proceeding
of
this
sort.
$37,500
doesn't
seem
like
much
money
perhaps
to
many
large
carriers.
it
was
an
enormous
amount
of
money
for
many
of
these
carriers
to
raise.
now,
this
application
as
it
was
pointed
out
was
filed
--
mr.
j.
max
harding
i
think
the
question
was
asked
what
the
amount
of
investment
was
made
by
these
carriers
and
i
just
reiterated
sir
that
that
was
--
mr.
j.
max
harding
--
the
figure.
now,
we
filed
this
application
as
it
has
been
pointed
out
under
section
207
of
the
act
and
proceeded
with
it
just
as
it
would
be
any
other
public
convenience
and
necessity
case.
throughout
these
proceedings
and
i'm
sure
it's
not
in
the
record,
there
has
been
some
mentioned
made
as
to
union
organizers
working
in
nebraska
in
1954
and
i
don't
know
where
that
came
from,
perhaps
it
incurred
some
in
the
brief
or
a
litigation
but
i
don't
believe
it's
in
the
record
and
if
they
were
there,
certainly,
some
of
my
clients
didn't
know
they
were
around
because
they
never
talked
to
them,
they
never
talked
to
the
--
their
employees
and
maybe
they
were
there
but
we
didn't
know
about
it.
now,
be
that
as
it
may,
when
this
service
deteriorated,
we
had
to
do
something.
these
small
carriers
were
conducting
their
regular
operations
to
and
from
omaha
on
their
regular
schedule
basis.
and
they
started
getting
their
complaints
from
the
receivers
of
the
freight
and
there
was
nothing
they
could
do
about
it
when
this
service
stopped.
repeated
request
were
filed
with
these
carriers
and
the
receivers
of
the
merchandise
complained
and
it
was
--
it
would
to
offer
situation.
and
as
this
record
shows,
we
attempted
to
prove
the
standard
elements
of
a
public
convenience
and
necessity
case
which
has
been
outlined
by
the
commission
in
the
old
pan-american
bus
line's
case.
whether
there
is
a
real
public
demand
in
need
for
the
service,
whether
the
existing
carriers
are
willing
to
provide
that
service
and
third,
whether
it
can
be
inaugurated
by
unduly
impairing
the
operation
of
the
existing
carriers.
now,
we
believe
that
we
amply
support
the
findings
of
the
commission
in
the
issuance
of
the
authority
which
it
did
grant.
there
were
some
--
well,
in
excess
of
50
public
shipper
witnesses
who
appeared
and
testified
before
the
commission
examiner
and
outlined
their
extreme
difficulty
in
conducting
their
business
because
they
depended
upon
this
transportation.
these
small
carriers
and
the
aggregate
served
over
200
nebraska
communities.
and
as
mr.
ginanne
pointed
out,
many
of
the
small
communities
are
entirely
dependent
upon
these
carriers
for
service
to
conduct
their
--
and
to
receive
their
daily
needs
of
living.
and
when
that
service
stops,
it
was
catastrophic
as
far
as
some
of
these
interior
towns
were
concerned.
mr.
j.
max
harding
no
sir.
mr.
j.
max
harding
well,
mr.
--
mr.
j.
max
harding
mr.
justice
black,
there
was
no
picketing.
my
clients
had
no
dispute
with
anyone.
mr.
j.
max
harding
well
now
--
mr.
j.
max
harding
yes.
mr.
j.
max
harding
i'd
like
to
touch
on
this
labor
dispute
as
fact.
i
know
that
that
term
has
been
used
a
great
deal
here
and
perhaps
i
don't
understand
just
what
a
labor
dispute
is.
but
these
unionized
carriers
testified
in
this
record
that
they
ceased
doing
business
with
these
nonunion
carriers
in
nebraska
on
the
advice
of
a
labor
counsel
located
in
chicago.
they
never
at
any
time
said
that
there
was
any
dispute
but
they
just
relied
upon
his
advice
that
they
should
stop
doing
business
with
these
nebraska
carriers.
now
we
necessarily
assume
that
these
labor
counsel
in
chicago
received
his
information
some
place
else
that
they
should
stop
doing
business
with
them.
but
there
--
mr.
j.
max
harding
that's
alright.
mr.
j.
max
harding
we
must
necessarily
assume
that
was
the
--
mr.
j.
max
harding
that's
what
precipitated.
mr.
j.
max
harding
yes.
mr.
j.
max
harding
i
think
one
of
them
did.
i'm
not
sure
that
they
both
did
sir.
my
time
is
short
and
i
would
like
to
touch
briefly
upon
the
election
of
the
remedy
which
we
sought
here.
there's
been
quite
a
bit
of
argument
about
the
proper
thing
to
have
done
here.
now,
we
did
not
file
a
complaint
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
we
did
not
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
or
seek
any
of
those
remedies
for
the
reason
we
didn't
think
we
had
time
and
those
that
had
previously
done
so
had
been
entirely
unsuccessful
in
getting
any
relief.
clark,
one
of
the
stockholders
had
been
having
some
labor
difficulty.
he's
the
only
one,
but
the
experience
of
clark
showed
us
that
it
was
fruitless
to
attempt
to
work
through
the
national
labor
relations
board.
clark
had
a
picket
line
established
september
15,
1955.
on
october
1,
1955,
unfair
labor
charges
were
filed
against
the
teamsters.
this
is
all
in
the
record.
on
december
7,
1955,
a
settlement
agreement
was
made
between
clark
and
the
teamsters
and
the
notices
were
posted
about
the
various
truck
line
terminals
that
they
were
not
to
interfere
with
clark
or
that
sort
of
thing.
on
february
15,
1956,
a
complaint
was
issued
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
against
the
teamsters
union
for
its
failure
to
comply
with
that
order.
now,
we're
getting
up
to
the
time
where
all
the
other
breakdown
takes
place,
but
we
of
course
were
familiar
with
what
had
happened
to
clark.
then
on
july
6,
1956,
the
national
labor
relations
board
examiner
issued
his
report
and
findings
and
found
that
the
union
had
been
conducting
unlawful
picketing
about
clark's
place
of
business
and
suggested
that
it
be
stopped.
at
case
--
that
examiner's
report
of
course
was
later
appealed,
but
then,
on
july
30th,
1956
and
to
me
this
is
what
broke
the
camel's
back,
a
temporary
injunction
was
issued
and
signed
by
the
chief
judge
for
the
district
of
nebraska
against
the
teamsters
union
and
ordering
them
to
cease
these
unlawful
activities
insofar
as
clark
was
concerned.
and
the
record
shows
that
the
unionized
carriers
paid
no
attention
to
that
order
and
certainly,
if
they're
not
going
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
order
issued
by
a
federal
judge,
they're
not
going
to
pay
attention
to
a
cease-and-desist
order
issued
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
the
national
labor
relations
board.
so
it's
our
belief
that
was
the
only
last
thing
we
could
do,
was
to
ask
for
operating
authority
in
order
to
render
the
service.
and
i
still
think
we
were
right
and
i
think
we
amply
sustained
a
need
for
that
service
and
the
commission
so
found
and
so
did
the
lower
court.
we
ask
your
affirmance
to
that
order.
mr.
j.
max
harding
well,
of
course,
the
commission
denied
that
extensive
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
max
harding
well,
we
did
ask
for
--
mr.
j.
max
harding
--
temporary
authority
mr.
chief
justice
and
as
mr.
ginanne
points
out,
had
we
not
asked
for
the
permanent
authority,
the
temporary
automatically
expires
that
gave
them
180
days,
that's
by
statutory
requirement.
mr.
j.
max
harding
thank
you.
