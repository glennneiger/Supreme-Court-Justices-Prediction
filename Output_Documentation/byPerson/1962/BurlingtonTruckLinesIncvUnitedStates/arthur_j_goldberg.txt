justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
axelrod,
may
i
ask
you
if
all
of
the
union
carriers
had
--
have
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
that
hot
cargo
provision
in
there?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
at
the
time
of
this
particular
proceeding?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
were
they
renewed?
do
you
know?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
renewed
their
contract
provisions
as
they
have
agreed
upon
with
the
union?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
axelrod,
who
would
have
then
the
(inaudible)
of
the
commission
to
order
those
carriers
who
were
not
carrying,
to
have
them
negotiate
the
“hot
cargo
provision?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
would
be
the
appropriate
relief
rather
than
the
commission
could
grant
otherwise
on
what
they
did?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
this
the
labor
dispute
or
the
temporary
carrier
where
the
labor
dispute
is
its
key
on
this
issue?
let
me
give
you
a
case
to
it.
suppose
it
were
a
labor
dispute
like
(inaudible)
which
lasted
for
11
years.
suppose
you're
--
you'd
be
under
those
circumstances
and
with
the
commission's
authority,
would
it
grant
a
temporary,
one
to
11
years,
or
grant
a
permanent
one,
for
it?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
i
think
--
suppose
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
axelrod
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
here
there
was
11
months,
as
i
understood
that
you
said,
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
axelrod,
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
in
your
brief
on
page
21,
it
said
here
that
they
brought
here
the
(inaudible)
which
has
been
a
claim
procedure
under
section
204
(c)
and
in
that
proceeding,
the
commission
could've
had
an
order
on
the
carrier,
the
carrier
to
this
merchandise,
those
who
are
going
to
do
so,
notwithstanding
the
union,
picketing
pressure,
etcetera,
was
there
(inaudible)
an
order
setting
aside,
or
perhaps
(inaudible)
agreement
that
the
carrier
made?
and
subservient,
would
then
could
the
commission
not
be
entering
into
labor
matters
on
collective
bargaining?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
won't
that
be
true
under
204
(c)?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
the
commission
held
a
right
to
choose
which
interference
it
wants
to
do
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
do
you
take
the
position
mr.
weinberg
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
that
under
the
amendments
of
the
landrum-griffin
act,
that
its
carriers
no
longer
voluntarily
enter
into
a
"hot
cargo"
clause?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
weinberg.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
do
you
have
to
carry
that
argument
that
far
after
you
--
didn't
you
agree
that
–
didn't
you
earlier
say
that
considering
the
fact
that
there
was
a
labor
dispute,
the
federal
government
[inaudible]
for
the
commission
to
exercise
its
own
authority
would
be
considered
in
respect
to
212
of
the
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
not
207?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
207
was
an
inappropriate
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
at
hand.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
this
your
argument
that
[inaudible]?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
they're
not
material.
and
why
would
that
be
[inaudible]
was
this
in
the
delay
of
the
traffic?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
--
were
there
significant
delays
as
far
as
they
[inaudible]?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
--
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
white
has
pointed
out
[inaudible]
there
is
nothing
in
the
order
[inaudible]
--
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
mr.
ginanne,
the
--
again,
i
think
you
know
the
reason
to
the
heart
of
that
problem
by
proceeding
under
204
(c)
which
is
the
cease-and-desist
order.
the
commission
in
effect
would
be
saying
to
the
carriers,
“do
at
least
what
burlington
and
santa
fe
are
doing.”
i
don't
quite
follow
why
you'd
find
that
that
is
not
an
appropriate
one
to
add
in
this
particular
situation.
certainly,
it
would
be
a
less
drastic
one
than
to
do
what
the
commission
did
which
was
to
issue
a
permanent
franchise,
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
ginanne,
is
there
any
other
case
where
the
commission
issued
[inaudible]
order
that
in
galveston,
in
the
labor
dispute
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
was
the
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
do
you
remember
what
you
did
on
that
[inaudible]
in
terms
of
the
labor
disputes,
the
efficacy
of
the
inducements
forward?
