it
banned

worth,
is
that
it?

whether

justice

wouldn't
have
any

what?
justice
william

brennan,

[inaudible]
would
it
also
be
unavailable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
would
the

would
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
not
in
that
--
in
that
context
the
very
point
made
that
this
is
out
of
bounds
for
the
commission
because
it
belonged
exclusively
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
would
not
also
be
involved
in
the
complaint
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
interrupted
you,
you
said
there
was
still
another
complaint
procedure,
you
mentioned
this
one
under
cease-and-desist.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
of
the
time
the
commission
granted
its
certificate,
it
had
no
idea
that
it
was
going
to
be
only
11
months,
it
was
still
going
on
then.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
--
i
thought
you
said
that
this
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
before
the
hearings
closed,
it
had
appeared
that
this
labor
dispute
was
terminated,
that
this
would
have
had
a
bearing
on
whether
or
not
the
permanent
certificate
would
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
reason
why
the
commission
could
not
have
deferred
final
action
longer
than
it
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
speaking
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
at
the
time
the
commission
acted
and
i
didn't
get
this
clearly.
you
said
at
the
time
the
hearings
closed
it
did
not
appear
or
it
was
not
the
fact
that
this
labor
dispute
was
terminated.
did
you
suggest
that
before
the
commission
decision
came
down,
however,
it
had
been
terminated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
any
discretion
in
the
commission
in
respect
to
the
timing
of
the
handing
down
of
a
decision
on
an
application
of
this
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
any
idea
how
long
after
the
commission
did
hand
down
its
decision,
the
dispute
in
fact
terminated
once
before?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
in
what
we
are
discussing
yesterday,
namely
that
landrum-griffin
amendment
probably
precludes
the
making
of
hot
cargo
agreements
of
the
kind
which
in
this
instance
resulted
in
the
difficulties
in
interchange
of
traffic
that
at
least
perhaps
that
possibility
for
the
future
has
been
minimized.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
any
consideration
for
us
in
this
case,
do
you
think?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
