justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
limit
of
the
--
by
which
the
temporary
certificate?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
put
a
question
to
you?
suppose
the
commission
had
adverted
to
these
and
other
possible
solutions
it
might
suggest
themselves
and
it
made
findings
that
each
one
of
them
was
impracticable
to
meet
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
and
that
temporary
certificate
would
not
have
mattered
either.
what
would
you
say
then
as
to
the
power
of
the
commission?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it
might
have
--
maybe
so
and
maybe
not,
they
didn't
advert
to.
they
didn't'
approach
the
case
in
that
way.
they
approached
this
as
an
ordinary
certificate
case,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
realized
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
that
but
you
take,
you
go
--
you
go
--
you
jump
from
that
to
the
premise
that
the
commission
has
no
authority
to
grant
us
a
permanent
certificate
in
these
--
in
this
situation,
none.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
suggesting
that
it
may
have
authority
if
it
can
give
reasons
or
--
for
showing
that
there
are
special
reasons
why
that
authority
has
to
be
exerted.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
that
i
understand
to
mean
that
--
you
say
that
where
there
is
simply
a
temporary
insufficiency
of
service,
temporary
that
that
could
never
give
authority
to
the
commission
to
grant
a
permanent
certificate.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
your
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
there
to
show
mr.
weinberg
that
the
board
didn't
--
the
icc
didn't
take
into
account
the
labor
policy?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
there
to
show
that
they
didn't
--
they
weren't
cognizant
of
the
fact,
of
that
area
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
southern
steamship
doesn't
suggest
that
in
such
circumstances,
icc
doesn't
have
any
jurisdiction.
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
question
is
what
is
there
to
show
that
they
weren't
mindful?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
record
show
what
the
present
status
of
the
labor
dispute
is?
justice
john
m.
harlan
were
there
any
objections
that
you're
telling
us
what
it
is?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
57
we're
dealing
with
now,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
your
answer
to
mr.
axelrod's
point,
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
could
have
been
met
by
the
commission
granting
a
temporary
certificate
and
then
extending
it
into
a
strike
situations
resolve
themselves.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
go
back
to
the
temporary
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
certificate.
as
i
understand
it,
incident
to
a
resolution
of
an
application
for
a
permanent
certificate,
the
commission
does
have
authority
to
extend
--
pending
the
conclusion
of
that
proceeding,
a
temporary
certificate,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore
with
this
application
for
a
permanent
certificate
pending,
the
commission
could've
adjourned
that
proceeding
from
time
to
time
and
continue
indefinitely
the
issue
of
a
temporary
certificate,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
there
was
power
to
do
what
mr.
axelrod
claims
should
have
been
done.
the
question
whether
it
should
have
been
done
is
another
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
instead
of
issuing
the
permanent
certificate
that
they
did,
they
could've
continued
the
temporary
certificate.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
that
but
supposing
they
had
not
denied
it
but
simply
continued
the
application?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
real
--
the
real
essence
of
the
complaint
here
as
i
see
it
is
that
by
granting
a
permanent
certificate,
the
commission
has
in
effect
fragmentized
or
interfered
with
the
ability
of
the
union
to
unionize
these
independent
carriers
in
the
sense
that
there
was
more
opportunity
to
unionize
them
if
they
were
operating
as
individual
carriers
than
if
they
are
brought
together
under
the
aegis
of
short
lines
and
become
a
larger
organization,
that
as
i
see
it
is
the
real
essence
of
this
--
of
their
complaint.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
to
that
extent,
the
commission
has
permanently
injected
itself
into
a
labor
dispute,
independently
of
the,
what
i
consider
is
the
narrower
question
as
to
whether
they
should
--
this
did
or
did
not
violate
the
hot
cargo
--
inject
itself
into
the
hot
cargo
clause
situation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
my
difficulty
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
of
the
commission's
report.
that's
my
difficulty
with
the
commission's
report
that
they
did
treat
this
matter
simply
and
solely
as
if
it
were
a
conventional
public
convenience
and
necessity
case.
and
where
you
have
got
an
interlap
--
an
overlap
between
two
sets
of
policies,
i
would
suppose
that
the
commission
would
have
to
make
findings
to
show
why
some
procedure,
other
than
a
procedure
which
you
admit,
does
have
a
permanent
impact
on
the
labor
policy
is
none
--
nonetheless
necessary.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
we're
not
told
why.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
bearing,
if
any,
does
the
fact
had
that
mr.
weinberg
--
that
was
not
shown
by
the
record
that
the
labor
dispute
at
the
present
time
is
in
fact
terminated?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
would
be
a
hazardous
assumption
to
make
even
looking
back
at
the
benefit
of
hindsight.
at
that
time
that
the
labor
--
that
the
commission
was
entitled
to
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
the
labor
dispute
was
never
entered
that
it
would
be
continued
intermittently
for
--
permanently
--
for
a
permanent
period
of
time.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
record
show
--
i
understand
that
the
investment
of
the
stockholder
carriers
in
the
formation
of
short
line?
justice
john
m.
harlan
thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
total
investment?
