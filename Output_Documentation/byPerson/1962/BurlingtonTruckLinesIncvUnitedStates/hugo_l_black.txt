justice

up
to
the
time
of
this
mr.
ginanne,
had
the
commission
ever
exercised
its
power
to
grant
any
kind
of
permit
in
order
on
--
because
traffic
was
interrupted
by
strike
activities
or
union
activities
that
were
lawful?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it
--
is
it
too
simple
to
--
i
don't
quite
under
--
is
it
too
simple
an
analysis
of
this
to
say,
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
commission
in
order
to
keep
the
flow
of
traffic,
without
moving,
has
power
to
grant
temporary
certificates
to
different
companies
that
are
not
on
strike
to
come
in
and
carry
the
goods
which
are
being
delayed
by
a
strike
or
strike
activities
that
are
lawful?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
get
down
to
the
question,
do
you
not
or
is
this
--
i'm
just
asking
though
that
maybe
too
simple
idea
on
here
as
to
whether
congress
has
through
the
interstate
commerce
act,
given
the
commission
to
solely
governmental
power
as
to
--
and
decide
against
the
striker
or
one
who's
carrying
it
on,
in
order
to
keep
the
traffic
moving?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
that
--
it
has
that
effect
of
course?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
object
in
purpose,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
my
question
is
not
as
to
the
--
for
the
idea
of
you
saying
that's
right
or
wrong.
i'm
just
trying
to
see
it
does
get
itself
down,
does
it
not,
under
the
facts
of
this
case
that
the
commission
has
acted
because
of
an
interruption
of
traffic,
solely
due
to
a
contract
which
was
made,
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
was
made,
which
was
lawful
and
where
that
is
interrupting
the
flow
of
traffic,
whether
the
commission
can
either
temporarily
or
permanently
or
both
--
issue
a
certificate
either
temporarily
or
permanently
or
both
in
order
to
see
that
traffic
moves
despite
the
fact
that
the
employers
and
the
union
are
in
engaging
in
conduct
which
is
lawful
under
the
national
act
--
labor
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
emphasizes
it,
does
it
not,
whatever
the
power
is,
the
importance
of
distinguishing
between
a
temporary
authority
to
do
such
things
which
carries
food
and
milk
and
necessary
commodities
to
people
and
certificate
that
lasts
of
course
over
a
long
period
of
time
and
can
result
in
breaking
a
strike
or
destroying
the
effect
of
collective
bargaining?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
judgment
on
the
case,
maybe
you
have
noticed
that
side
of
it,
that
what
is
being
done
--
was
being
done
by
this
company
and
the
union
were
both
within
the
range
of
activities
that
are
lawful
under
the
labor
relations
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
agree
to
that.
that
gets
the
questions
of
preemption
of
course,
when
you
get
to
that
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
just
trying
to
find
out
if
what
you
said
at
the
case
and
you
know
far
more
better
than
i
do,
whether
in
your
judgment
there
is
anything
that
has
been
attributed
to
the
union
or
the
employers
by
the
commission,
that
is
unlawful?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
question
then
of
whether
doing
that
which
is
lawful
in
connection
with
the
labor
dispute,
the
commission
has
power
by
reason
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
issue
a
certificate
because
of
the
interruption
of
traffic
due
to
that
conflict,
issue
a
certificate
either
temporary
or
permanent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
not
any
doubt
--
any
dispute
about
that,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
the
question
is,
isn't
it
that
the
[inaudible]
--
that
that
was
due
to
the
effectiveness
of
picketing
and
whether
the
commission
has
a
right
to
grant
the
certificate
to
the
new
company
because
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
picketing
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
you
call
it
picketing
or
carrying
hot
cargo
and
it
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
labor
union's
activities
and
standing
up
there
and
blocking
the
ships
because
people
didn't
want
to
carry
a
hot
cargo.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
--
i'm
not
saying
that's
right
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
it
isn't
or
that
that
doesn't
--
but
is
there
any
dispute
about
the
fact,
it
was
the
fact
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
whatever
--
whatever
that
is,
its
--
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
it
the
fact
that
--
can
you
think
of
anything
else
that
caused
this
interruption
factually,
except
the
position
of
the
labor
union
and
position
of
other
people
who
wouldn't
carry
a
hot
cargo.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
this
whole
thing,
isn't
it?
that's
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
brought
it
on.
