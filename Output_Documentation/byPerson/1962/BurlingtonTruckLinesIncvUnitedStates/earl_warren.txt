mr.

oh,
mr.

yes.
chief

mr.

chief

earl

this
is
an
interplay
between
two
governmental
policies,
labor
policy
and
the
transportation
policy
and
the
icc
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
enforcing
the
transportation
policy,
must
it
abdicate
whenever
there
is
any
conflict
of
any
kind
with
the
--
with
the
labor
policy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
what
you
just
read
indicated
that
they
recognized
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction
in
the
labor
matter
and
that
they
were
merely
deciding
the
transportation
matter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
is
their
contrary
to
that
in
their
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
their
findings?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
said
--
he
said
specifically,
did
he
not,
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
findings
of
his
do
you
object
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
think
everyone
must
admit
that
the
labor
dispute
is
what
caused
it,
but
the
question
i
ask
is,
have
they
gone
into
the
labor
field
when
they're
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
enforcing
the
transportation
policy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
there
were
two
competing
claimants
for
a
permit?
one
of
them
had
to
strike
on
and
the
other
one
didn't
and
the
icc
took
the
one
that
didn't
have
a
strike
on
carrier
and
gave
it
the
permit.
would
--
would
you
think
it
was
interfering
there
then
with
the
labor
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
this
would
be
different,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
it
would
be
different.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
they
were
granting
it
because
there
wasn't
any
--
there
wasn't
any
transportation
employee.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
--
i
recall
what
he
said
but
because
there
was
a
lack
of
adequate
transportation
facilities.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
weinberg,
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
in
your
opinion,
the
icc
has
no
jurisdiction
to
proceed
by
way
of
complaint,
what
can
it
do
to
enforce
the
national
transportation
policy
in
this
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
that
isn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
mean
there's
a
vacuum
now
that
they
must
be
frustrated
in
doing
anything?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we're
not
talking
about
the
railroad,
we're
talking
about
the
power
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
here
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
it
frustrated
in
either
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
welcome.
mr.
ginnane.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ginanne
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
suppose
--
suppose
this
was
the
strike
against
the
--
these
lines,
these
--
the
burlington
truck
lines
and
over
some
other
clause
of
collective
bargaining
agreement,
not
a
hot
cargo
and
they
--
their
service
was
effective
as
it
has
been
here
for
a
period
of
11
months.
would
your
argument
tell
you
as
far
as
to
say
that
in
that
circumstance
the
commission
could
grant
a
permanent
permit
to
someone
else?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ginanne,
before
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
change
to
another
subject,
i
was
just
wondering
if
to
what
extent,
if
and
to
what
extent,
the
commission
took
into
consideration
the
statement
by
the
applicant
that
it
was
nonunion
and
that
under
no
circumstances
would
it
ever
--
and
ever,
ever
agree
to
a
collective
bargaining
under
--
to
a
hot
cargo
clause
in
its
--
in
any
contract
and
that
if
it
did,
it
would
surrender
its
charter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
in
the
record
though.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
harding.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
examiner
found
that,
didn't
he,
specifically?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
you
ask
for
a
temporary
--
a
temporary
permit
confined
to
the
area
rather
than
ask
for
a
permanent
permit
to
extend
all
over
that
part
of
the
country,
35
states
i
think,
mr.
ginanne
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
they
did,
but
i
say
if
that
was
the
reason
why
you
elected
in
this
case,
why
didn't
you
--
why
didn't
you
take
the
other
course
in
that
for
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice
overlap)
a
temporary
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
--
have
you
more
time
mister?
i
didn't
know
you
have
more
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
--
our
record
here
shows
that
the
two
of
you
together
had
64
minutes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
am
i
correct
on
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
clerk
tells
me
that
i
am
correct
in
that.
so,
i
guess
we
will
have
to
go
to
the
next
case
mr.
axelrod.
