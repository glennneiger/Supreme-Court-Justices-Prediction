justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
weinberg,
are
you
arguing
this
whole
--
the
"hot
cargo"
clauses
which
were
invoked
in
this
situation.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
sure
that
(inaudible)
that
this
record
sustained
the
fact
that
it
was
the
particular
kind
of
a
"hot
cargo"
clause,
that
you
have
here
that
was
invoked?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
all
the
employer
was
found
to
do,
was
not
to
fire
somebody.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
--
(inaudible)
of
the
"hot
cargo"
clause
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
that
isn't
the
--
that
isn't
the
--
that
wasn't
the
operative
--
the
operative
tax
period,
here
in
this
case,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
--
how
was
that
the
interruptions
took
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
they
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
that
isn't
what
the
"hot
cargo"
clause
found
the
carrier
to
do.
it
just
said,
â€œwe
won't
acknowledge
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
that
these
"hot
cargo"
clause
involved
here
found
the
carrier
not
to
handle
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
or
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
awhile
ago
you
said
--
i
thought
that,
all
it
found
them
to
do
was
not
to
fire
somebody.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
concede
they
could
compel
them
serve
in
a
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
so
your
answer
is
they
could
not
do
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ginanne,
could
you
help
me
out
on
this?
i
thought
yesterday
that
mr.
weinberg
indicated
that
the
carrier
in
this
hot
cargo
clause,
it
undertake
it
not
to
handle
[inaudible].
and
i
gather
that
if
the
carrier
wanted
to
handle
[inaudible]
to
provide
some
personnel,
he
was
--
coming
in
to
do
so
under
this
hot
cargo
clause
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
weren't
legally
bound
for
the
hot
cargo
clause
and
not
attempted
to
do
it.
it's
just
that
they
couldn't
fire
employees
who
reviewed
the
handling
or
[inaudible]
or
they
might
take
that
to
the
strike?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
[inaudible]
--
a
moment
of
strike
and
there
would
be
a
trial
of
economic
strike
in
order
to
comply
with
your
ordinance,
is
that
right?
