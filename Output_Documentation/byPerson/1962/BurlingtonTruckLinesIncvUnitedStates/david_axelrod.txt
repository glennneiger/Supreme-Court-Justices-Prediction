mr.
david
axelrod
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
twin
truck
line
appellants
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
weinberg
represents
the
union
appellant.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
illinois
which
dismissed
a
complaint
to
set
aside
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
granted
a
certificate
authorizing
the
performance
of
permanent
motor
carrier
operations
in
interstate
commerce
by
the
appellee,
nebraska
short
line
carriers.
the
appellant
truck
lines
are
certificated
interstate
carriers
authorized
to
serve
omaha,
nebraska
on
the
one
hand,
chicago,
kansas
city,
and
saint
louis
on
the
other,
the
points
between
which
the
commission
granted
the
certificate
to
the
nebraska
short
line
carriers.
the
nebraska
short
line
carriers
which
was
the
applicant
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
the
certificate
is
a
nebraska
corporation
organized
and
owned
by
12
motor
carriers,
nine
union
carriers,
operating
wholly
within
the
state
of
nebraska
in
interstate
commerce.
these
carriers
use
the
point
of
omaha,
nebraska
as
an
interchanged
point
for
the
purpose
of
interchanging
traffic
with
the
appellant
truck
lines.
about
1954,
the
union
undertook
to
organize
the
employees
of
the
nonunion
carriers
in
nebraska.
their
organizational
activities
were
unsuccessful
and
the
result
was
that
the
labor
pressure
was
brought
to
bear
which
had
the
effect
of
restricting
the
activities
of
the
appellant,
certificated
truck
lines,
who
had
been
interchanging
traffic
at
omaha
with
the
nonunion
carriers.
this
pressure
came
about
as
a
result
of
the
fact,
that
the
appellant,
certificated
lines,
have
"hot
cargo"
clauses,
which
was
customary
at
the
time
with
the
union
under
which
it
was
provided
that
a
carrier
wouldn't
discharge
or
discipline
any
employee
who
refused
to
cross
a
picket
line
or
refused
to
handle
freight
tendered
by
anyone
who
was
engaged
in
a
labor
dispute.
as
a
result
of
the
union
invoking
its
labor
pressures,
about
may
1956,
the
local
nonunion
nebraska
carriers
experienced
certain
interchange
difficulties
with
some,
but
not
all
of
the
other
carriers
with
whom
they
had
been
interchanging
at
omaha,
nebraska.
the
result
of
which
was
the
filing
by
this
cooperative
nebraska
short
line
carriers
inc.
of
two
applications
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
both
of
these
were
designed
to
substitute
for
the
appellant
truck
lines
and
to
provide
an
outlet
for
them
in
connection
with
the
movement
of
their
freight,
moving
to
and
from
points
in
nebraska.
in
addition
to
the
two
permanent
applications,
the
nebraska
short
lines
also
filed,
at
the
height
of
the
problem,
a
temporary
authority
application.
this
temporary
authority
application
was
granted
by
the
commission
in
the
year
january,
1957.
the
difficulties
had
been
encountered
immediately
prior
to
1957
and
for
a
period
of
time
which
could
establish
a
date
of
approximately
the
latter
part
of
1956.
nebraska
short
lines,
though
it
was
granted
its
temporary
authority
in
january
of
1957,
did
not
commence
its
operations
until
march
of
1957.
and
so
here
at
the
very
beginning
and
at
the
outset
of
the
problem,
nebraska
short
lines,
the
fighting
ship
of
the
12
nonunion
carriers
who
had
organized
it,
did
not
set
sail
until
several
months
after
it
had
obtained
its
right
to
start
a
service
from
the
commission.
both
examiners
who
heard
the
two
applications
for
permanent
authority
recommended
denials
of
both
applications.
both
examiners
found
that
there
was
no
need
for
the
service.
examiner
sutherland
in
the
first
instance
found
that
two
carriers,
two
of
the
appellants,
burlington
and
santa
fe
trail,
have
always
continued
to
interchange
with
the
nebraska
carriers.
examiner
driscoll
in
the
second
case
found
that
after
a
period
of
time
and
approximately
at
the
time
of
the
second
hearing
which
was
in
april
of
1957,
that
in
addition
to
burlington
and
santa
fe
trail,
three
other
carriers
began
to
resume
the
interchange
of
their
traffic,
namely,
watson,
(inaudible),
and
independent
truckers.
the
findings
of
facts
of
both
examiners
were
confirmed
by
the
commission,
adopted
by
the
commission,
and
beyond
that,
the
findings
of
facts
of
both
examiners
were
also
acknowledged
by
the
district
court
which
for
the
case
subsequently.
important
as
i
see
it
are
some
specific
findings
of
fact
of
the
two
examiners.
may
i
direct
your
attention
please
to
the
record
at
page
54
at
which
examiner
sutherland,
the
first
examiner
indicated,
“the
evidence
shows
that
burlington
has
continued
to
interchange
with
applicant
stockholders
at
omaha
and
lincoln
on
interstate
traffic
originated
at
or
delivered
to
various
points
in
nebraska.”
again
at
page
55,
referring
to
santa
fe
trail,
the
finding
specifically
is,
in
1955
and
1956
at
omaha,
santa
fe
trail
interchanged
interstate
traffic
moving
to
and
from
nebraska
points
with
abler,
wilbur,
clark,
peters,
lyon,
mccay,
pony,
and
so
forth.
in
most
instances
santa
fe
trail
delivered
considerably
more
traffic
to
these
carriers
than
it
received.
these
are
the
carriers
who
represented
the
nebraska
short
line
cooperative.
i
want
to
direct
your
attention
if
i
may
please
further
to
a
very
specific
finding
of
the
second
examiner
who
heard
the
second
application
and
who
denied
it,
and
i
refer
if
i
may
please
to
page
87
of
the
record
which
indicates
a
finding
by
examiner
driscoll
at
page
87
of
the
record
at
finding
number
23
of
examiner
driscoll,
there's
this
to
be
found.
when
the
evidence
of
these
12-carrier
representatives
is
carefully
and
fairly
examined,
it
must
be
said
that
not
one
of
them
complained
of
interchange
conditions
or
of
connecting
line
services
in
existence
prior
to
the
rise
of
union
pressure
in
early
1956.
in
other
words,
not
one
of
them
showed
or
even
alleged
that
when
conditions
were
normal,
they
then
had
a
need
for
a
new
or
additional
connecting
line
at
omaha.
all
their
complaints
are
in
fact
bottomed
on
the
rise
of
union
pressure.
i'd
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
please
if
i
may
to
a
further
specific
finding
by
the
same
examiner.
at
page
95
of
the
record,
where
the
examiner
first
in
connection
with
finding
number
32
details
very
specifically
the
evidence
submitted
in
opposition
to
the
application
in
which
about
29
motor
carriers
submitted
evidence
on
opposition
to
the
application,
and
the
indication
by
the
examiner
that
all
of
them
declared
that
except
for
conditions
not
due
to
their
own
initiative
or
desire,
they
have
been
ready,
able,
and
willing
to
provide
service
for
all
traffic
offered
by
shippers
or
connecting
carriers.
and
lastly,
to
the
finding
of
examiner
driscoll
at
page
95,
in
finding
number
34,
which
is
the
next
to
the
last
sentence
of
his
finding
which
keys
the
issue
in
this
proceeding.
were
it
not
for
the
effects
of
union
pressure
upon
these
carriers,
there
would
have
been
no
material
problem
to
complain
of,
and
there
would
be
no
problem
here
to
consider,
no
matter
how
this
problem
is
viewed,
it
has
but
one
origin,
labor
pressure.
if
the
labor
effects
were
removed
from
this
problem,
no
problem
of
any
appreciable
substance
would
remain.
in
that
situation,
the
question
is,
whether
a
grant
of
authority
should
be
made,
to
meet,
and
overcome
the
effects
of
labor
difficulties.
as
we
see
it,
this
is
the
issue
in
the
case.
and
the
question
that
we
present
to
the
court
is
whether
a
temporary
service
interruption
which
involves
the
interchange
of
freight
between
nonunion
carriers
and
some,
but
not
all,
union
carriers
which
arises
out
of
a
labor
dispute,
may
consistently
with
the
standards
set
forth
in
the
interstate
commerce
act,
and
the
national
transportation
policy,
we
made
the
basis
for
the
grant
of
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
mr.
david
axelrod
they
did,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
david
axelrod
they
did.
mr.
david
axelrod
my
understanding
is
that
they
have
been
renewed
and
that
they
are
in
effect
today
slightly
changed.
but
in
essence,
the
same,
and
that
all
of
the
carriers
in
fact
today,
this
is
not
a
part
of
the
record
however,
are
operating
under
what
may
still
be
termed
a
"hot
cargo"
clause
contract.
mr.
david
axelrod
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir.
as
a
corollary
to
the
question
that
we
present
to
the
court,
we
also
argue
--
in
our
brief
and
we
point
out
to
the
court
today
that
one
of
the
questions
supplemental
to
the
basic
question
is
whether
or
not
the
commission
in
this
proceeding
erroneously
used
the
grant
of
a
certificate,
a
permanent
certificate,
where
the
appropriate
remedy,
if
any,
was
a
complaint
proceeding
under
section
204
(c)
and
212
of
the
act
to
compel
these
particular
carriers,
to
comply
with
their
obligations
under
certificates.
we
also
urge
in
the
brief
filed
with
this
court
that
the
commission's
findings,
that
the
commission's
conclusion
is
diametrically
opposed
to
its
own
findings
of
fact,
in
turn,
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
examiners,
judge
mercer
in
his
dissenting
opinion
which
is
part
of
the
record
where
specifically
meets
that
issue.
we
take
the
position
in
this
proceeding
that
in
granting
the
certificate,
the
commission
erred
and
that
it
exceeded
its
jurisdiction
in
utilizing
the
certificate
section,
in
fact,
as
a
penalty
and
having
exceeded
its
jurisdiction,
it
has
lost
its
role
as
an
expert.
the
commission
in
granting
the
certificate
in
which
it
failed
to
agree
with
its
examiners,
indicates
to
this
court
in
a
very
self-serving
and
albeit
biased
declaration
that
it
was
not
attempting
to
adjudicate
a
labor
dispute.
it
took
the
position
that
it
was
vitally
concerned
not
with
the
labor
problem
but
with
the
relationship
of
the
carriers
in
respect
to
their
obligations
to
serve
the
public
and
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
were
some
carriers
who
had
continued
uninterruptedly
to
serve
the
public.
the
commission
took
the
position
that
the
responsibility
for
the
service
deficiencies
which
existed
at
the
time
would
be
laid
or
should
be
laid
at
the
hands
of
the
unionized
carriers.
it's
interesting
that
the
appellee,
nebraska
short
lines
inc.
came
to
the
commission
and
made
the
specific
statement
that
it
would
never,
under
any
circumstance,
sign
a
"hot
cargo"
clause
contract
and
even
indicated
to
the
commission
that
it
wouldn't
want
a
certificate
based
upon
its
having
to
sign
a
"hot
cargo"
clause
contract.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
before
the
district
court
counsel
for
nebraska
short
line
carriers
emphasized
to
the
court
that
he
would
even
be
willing
to
have
its
certificate
granted
by
the
commission
to
it,
limited
and
conditioned
upon
it
being
and
remaining
a
nonunion
carrier
and
it
has
so
indicated
before
the
commission
and
to
the
district
court.
in
this
proceeding,
we
take
the
position
that
the
problem
involved
was
a
temporary
service
interruption,
that
it
terminated
on
the
basis
of
the
examiner's
findings
in
approximately
april
of
1957.
and
that
even
before
its
termination,
there
were
carriers
available
with
which
to
conduct
the
interchange
of
service
at
omaha.
and
that
the
grant
by
the
commission
of
a
permanent
authority
under
these
circumstances
was
illegal
and
beyond
the
intention
and
purpose
of
the
certificate
section
of
the
act.
we
take
the
position
that
the
purpose
of
section
207
(a)
which
is
the
certificate
section,
is
to
assure
the
public
of
adequate
service.
it
is
not
to
resolve
a
labor
dispute.
it
is
not
to
punish
a
union
carrier
who
in
good
faith
collectively
bargains
with
its
employees.
and
it
is
not
to
reward
a
nonunion
carrier
for
carrying
on
a
fight
with
the
union.
we
take
the
position
that
section
207
(a)
has
as
its
purpose,
the
achievement
of
a
long
term
balance
between
supply
and
demand
of
transportation
service,
this
on
a
normal
basis
and
not
on
a
temporary
or
an
abnormal
basis.
we
argue
before
this
court
that
in
using
section
207
(a)
as
the
commission
did
which
contemplated
permanent
certification
of
motor
carrier
services,
that
the
commission
had
misapplied
the
act,
that
it
has
created
a
permanent
carrier
only
to
meet
a
temporary
situation.
mr.
david
axelrod
temporary
authority
by
statute
is
authorized
for
a
period
of
180
days
but
is
permissible
and
it
may
be
continued
and
has
in
fact
been
continued
by
the
commission,
and
is
in
existence
today.
so
that
from
the
standpoint
of
the
question,
there
is
no
limitation
upon
the
duration
of
a
temporary
authority.
this
appellee,
nebraska
short
lines
received
this
temporary
authority
january,
didn't
commence
its
operations
until
march
of
1957,
and
is
today
operating
under
the
temporary
authority
because
the
permanent
certificate
granted
to
it
by
the
commission
under
this
order
is
the
subject
of
this
proceeding.
we
take
the
position
in
connection
--
mr.
david
axelrod
under
the
law.
mr.
david
axelrod
until
further
order
of
the
commission
and
the
commission's
practice
has
been
to
extend
it
so
long
as
there
is
pending
some
permanent
application
to
which
the
temporary
authority
can
attach.
if
the
permanent
application
would
be
denied,
the
temporary
authority
would
cancel
on
its
own
expiration.
mr.
david
axelrod
not
necessarily
mr.
justice
stewart,
for
the
reason
that
nebraska
short
line
carriers,
the
appellee
here,
began
its
business
as
the
record
indicates
with
some
leased
equipment,
with
some
small
beginning
terminal
facilities
and
is
in
fact
that
they're
operating
as
such
with
a
substantial
amount
or
at
least
most
of
its
equipment
on
a
leased
basis.
but
even
answering
the
question,
yes,
i
submit
with
all
due
respect
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
criteria
from
the
standpoint
of
the
problem
involved
here
because
if
there
was
a
temporary
authority
need,
the
commission
is
satisfied
that
need
by
the
grant
of
a
temporary
authority.
and
we
follow
that
further
with
the
proposition
in
argument
that
under
the
section
204
and
212
which
is
the
compliance
section
that
the
remedy
here
--
the
remedy
here
should
have
been
first
used
that
is
to
compel
the
carriers
who
were
not
serving
and
not
penalize
the
carriers
who
were
serving.
and
that
until
such
time
as
that
remedy
had
been
tried
and
found
to
be
ineffective.
there
was
no
need
for
the
grant
of
a
permanent
certificate.
mind
you,
the
temporary
certificate
could
continue
and
would
continue
pending
the
testing
of
the
effectiveness
of
that
remedy
under
the
compliance
rather
than
the
certificate
section
and
this
is
the
number
of
our
position
with
this
court.
mr.
david
axelrod
i
don't
think
the
commission
would
have
the
right
to,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
because
--
and
mr.
weinberg
will
argue
the
point
of
the
so-called
conflict
or
the
conflict
between
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
labor
act.
and
we
say
in
this
case
that
the
commission
in
fact
attempted
to
do
that
because
it
indicates
to
the
carriers
by
its
order
here
that
it
cannot
bargain
on
the
subject
of
"hot
cargo"
clause,
because
it
declares
that
kind
of
a
clause
as
such
an
unbargainable
position
and
we
say
it's
part
of
our
argument
in
those
proceeding
and
mr.
weinberg
will
elaborate
that.
but
the
commission
has
in
fact
now
sitting
in
on
a
bargaining
table,
participating
at
the
bargaining
table,
and
indicating
that
no
such
"hot
cargo"
clause
can
be
entered
into.
mr.
david
axelrod
the
commission
--
the
commission's
appropriate
relief
was
as
it
did
here
to
grant
a
temporary
authority.
and
pending
--
and
while
the
temporary
authority
was
in
existence
and
while
the
service
was
instituted
so
that
there
was
no
question
about
any
temporary
gap,
test
the
effectiveness
of
the
complaint
procedure,
test
the
effectiveness
of
that,
and
if
that
failed,
then
it
would
be
found
that
there
was
no
service.
but
in
this
case,
the
commission
find
--
did
not
find
that
there
was
no
service.
there
is
not
a
finding
of
an
adequacy
in
this
record.
the
only
finding
is
that
there
was
a
temporary
interruption
of
service
and
it
is
this
which
we
complained
about.
and
we
say
that
a
temporary
interruption
of
service
should
not
be
the
basis
for
certificating
a
permanent
carrier.
mr.
david
axelrod
in
the
case
of
cotter
(ph),
we
don't
have
a
question
of
public
service
as
we
do
in
the
case
here.
mr.
david
axelrod
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
mr.
--
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
don't
think
that
time
element
is
the
criteria
because
following
your
question
may
i
be
so
bold
as
to
suggest
that
in
the
case
of
a
northwestern
railroad
which
recently
was
on
strike
for
some
period
of
time.
would
it
be
then
appropriate
on
that
instance
because
of
that
situation
to
have
granted
a
new
railroad,
a
certificate
as
a
permanent
carrier
because
it
was
out
of
business
for
approximately
45
or
50
or
55
days?
mr.
david
axelrod
in
this
case
--
mr.
david
axelrod
not
particularly
11
months.
we
contend
that
under
the
facts
of
record
here
the
controversy
or
at
least
the
service
--
the
temporary
service
efficiency
expired
or
it
was
removed
in
april
of
1957,
that
the
pressure
began
approximately
may
of
1956,
that
period
of
time.
but,
mind
you
during
all
that
period
of
time,
our
point
is
that
there
was
always
some
service,
there
was
always
a
service
by
burlington,
there
was
always
a
service
by
santa
fe
trail,
and
there
were
other
services
which
the
examiners
have
detailed
in
this
finding.
so,
that
it
wasn't
the
case
of
all
service
having
been
abandoned,
all
service
having
been
interrupted.
it
was
the
case
of
some
carrier
service
having
been
interrupted.
this
is
the
distinction
which
we
tried
to
find
out.
we
take
the
position
in
this
case
that
since
the
difficulty
involved
had
a
single
origin
and
that
is
labor
pressure,
that
what
the
commission
has
done
in
this
case
has,
in
fact,
substituted
a
philosophy
of
nonunionism
for
the
subtle
standards
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
and
we
submit
that
there
is
no
such
standard
in
the
commission's
act.
at
the
same
time
we
take
the
position
that
the
effect
of
the
grant
of
the
certificate
instead
of
resorting
to
the
compliance
procedure
was
to
penalize
those
carriers
who
had
been
performing
a
service.
the
commission
concerned
itself
in
its
brief,
the
position
i'm
sure,
where
the
fact
that
it
has
a
duty
to
perform
and
that
that
duty
to
sus
--
is
to
supply
the
service
when
an
applicant
seeks
to
perform
it.
in
this
case,
i
submit
that
the
commission
has
performed
that
duty.
it
did
its
very
outset
when
it
grant
the
temporary
authority.
it
needed
no
more
from
that
standpoint
until
resort
had
been
affected
to
the
compliance
procedure
under
section
204
and
section
212.
we
take
another
position
in
this
case
and
i'll
briefly
indicate
it
only
by
preference
to
--
mr.
david
axelrod
well,
it
would
--
the
commission
would
have
--
had
to
be
more
than
clairvoyant,
mr.
justice
harlan,
to
have
made
such
a
finding
or
such
a
con
--
drawn
such
conclusions.
mr.
david
axelrod
but
our
point
is
that
this
is
not
an
ordinary
certificate
case.
this
is
--
mr.
david
axelrod
this
is
an
unusual
one.
it's
the
first
that
has
happened
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
axelrod
we
don't
say
it
that
way.
mr.
david
axelrod
we
don't
say
that
the
commission
has
no
authority
to
grant
a
certificate.
the
commission
has
authority
to
grant
any
certificate
but
we
say
that
the
commission
misapplied
its
certificate
on
this
case
and
exceeded
its
jurisdiction
because
of
the
fact
that
to
grant
a
certificate
here
to
meet
a
temporary
situation
and
not
a
permanent
situation,
and
that
the
act
is
designed
to
achieve
a
national
transportation
system
which
covers
a
normal
and
a
permanent
operation
and
not
a
temporary.
we
admit
that
there
is
jurisdiction
to
issue
a
certificate.
but
our
point
is
that
the
commission
misapplied
the
section
in
granting
a
certificate
in
this
case
based
upon
these
facts.
mr.
david
axelrod
that's
our
position
because
--
mr.
david
axelrod
--
because
of
the
fact
that
there
is
in
this
instance
the
temporary
authority
which
was
issued,
which
supplied
the
service
and
there
is
further
in
this
instance
the
pattern
of
framework
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
allowed
for
the
remedy
of
complaint
in
addition
to
the
remedy
of
temporary
authority.
judge
mercer
in
this
instance
in
the
dissenting
opinion,
points
out
the
problem
that
were
confronted
here
by
indicating
and
if
i
may
refer
to
his
dissenting
opinion
at
page
266
of
the
record.
and
he
says,
i
quote,
“i
think
the
evil
of
the
order
lies
in
a
simple
but
very
significant
fact
which
both
the
commission
and
the
majority
of
this
court
overlooked,
namely
that
the
basic
findings
of
the
commission's
report
and
the
evidence
introduced
before
the
hearing
examiner
are
geared
to
the
complaint
procedures
established
by
section
212
of
the
act,
and
not
to
the
procedure
contemplated
by
the
express
provisions
of
section
207.”
we
take
the
position
on
this
case
that
the
commission
as
a
matter
fact
has
created
a
new
penalty,
a
penalty
in
the
sense
that
a
certificate
section
for
the
grant
of
a
certificate
was
never
intended
to
penalize
those
carriers
who
had
continued
a
service.
the
commission
on
this
case
was
without
authority
to
dispose
of
the
merits
of
this
case
because
it
was
a
labor
dispute.
and
in
this
case
particularly,
the
commission
has
indicated
that
it
did
so
because
of
the
fact
that
a
breach
of
duty
had
been
perpetrated
by
those
carriers
who
had
signed
these
hot
cargo
agreements.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commission's
decision
turns
upon
the
fact
that
those
carriers
who
signed
hot
cargo
agreements
had
subrogated,
in
effect,
their
duty
or
right
to
serve
the
public
in
respect
to
their
having
signed
the
hot
cargo
agreements.
in
this
case,
our
position
is
that
if
this
decision
is
allowed
to
stand
who
we
come
a
very
dangerous
kind
of
precedent.
it
will
grant
onto
the
interstate
commerce
act
a
new
standard
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
which
is
we
say
without
authority
of
the
commission
and
which
we
say
is
outside
of
the
act.
this
is
the
first
time
in
the
annals
of
the
commission,
and
i'm
sure
that
mr.
ginnane
will
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
that
the
commission
has
authorized
the
institution
of
a
new
kind
of
motor
carrier
service
or
a
new
motor
carrier
operating
right
because
of
temporary
and
partial
deficiencies
due
to
labor
difficulties.
in
this
case,
we
take
the
position
that
having
exceeded
its
jurisdiction.
the
commission's
role
as
an
expert
has
been
lost.
i
know
the
commission
will
argue
that
it
is
the
expert
in
the
field,
that
the
question
of
granting
a
certificate
is,
wide,
broad,
and
discretionary
within.
it
is
our
position
that
having
step
outside
of
its
field
to
resolve
a
labor
dispute.
the
commission
has
not
concerned
itself
with
transportation
but
has
concerned
itself
with
the
labor
problem
which
underlies
the
difficulty
involved.
and
on
that
basis
we
take
the
position
that
the
commission
has
lost
its
expertise
and
it
cannot
be
claimed
for
it.
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case
has
been
misused
and
we
take
the
position
that
it
would
be
unrealistic
on
this
record
to
say
that
the
certification
process
which
the
commission
employed
in
this
proceeding
would
not
in
fact
be
punishment
against
those
carriers
who
have
continued
to
serve.
in
this
case,
the
commission
had
not
settled
a
problem
by
the
grant
of
a
new
certificate.
all
the
commission
did
was
to
grant
a
permanent
certificate
in
this
case
which
was
not
limited
to
the
peculiar
circumstances
based
upon
which
it
was
issued.
this
certificate
authorizes
a
service
by
the
appellee,
nebraska
short
line
carriers
between
chicago
and
omaha,
kansas
city,
and
st.
louis.
it
has
restricted
the
traffic
moving
to
and
from
nebraska
points.
but
it
is
otherwise
none
restrictive
in
any
sense
of
the
word.
the
nebraska
short
line
carriers
can
perform
any
kind
and
type
of
service
under
this
certificate.
the
only
difference
is
in
this
case
that
nebraska
short
line
carriers
is
a
nonunion
carrier.
and
so
the
only
thing
which
the
commission
has
established
new
in
this
proceeding
is
to
give
a
certificate
to
a
nonunion
carrier
and
not
to
give
a
certificate
where
there
is
basis
for
--
on
a
need
for
permanent
service.
mr.
weinberg
will
follow
with
respect
to
union's
position.
mr.
david
axelrod
this
is
our
position,
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
the
commission
certainly
in
the
case
of
issuing
the
certificate
here,
has
entered
into
the
subject
of
the
labor
field,
has
impinged
upon
and
conflicts
with
the
labor
act
which
guarantees
to
the
employees
the
right
to
collective
bargaining.
mr.
david
axelrod
it
could
be
true
under
204
(c)
as
well.
at
the
same
time
--
mr.
david
axelrod
we
take
the
position
the
commission
had
no
right
to
interfere
with
the
labor
act
as
it
did
in
this
case
by
granting
the
certificate
here.
but
if
the
complaint
procedure
had
been
used,
it
would
have
squarely
focused
the
question
upon
the
labor
controversy.
that
complaint
procedure
could
have
been
followed
and
directed
against
those
carriers
who
were
temporarily
out
of
service,
not
against
those
who
had
continued
to
serve.
in
addition
to
that,
the
commission
could
have
compelled
those
carriers
to
serve.
had
they
not
serve
then
after
such
an
order
compelling?
they
stood
the
risk
of
their
certificates
begin
revoked
against
them.
but
at
least
until
that
happens,
there
was
no
warrant
in
the
law,
for
the
skipping
of
that
procedure,
for
the
skimping
of
its
responsibility
under
the
act,
and
jumping
to
the
certificate
section.
mr.
david
axelrod
your
honor,
thank
you.
mr.
david
axelrod
may
it
please
the
court,
so
that
there'll
be
--
mr.
david
axelrod
i
have
reserved
--
i
thought
i
have
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
axelrod
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
assumed
that
i
have
my
time.
mr.
david
axelrod
yes.
