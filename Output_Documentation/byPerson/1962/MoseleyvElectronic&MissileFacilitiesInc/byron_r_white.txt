justice

[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it
your
point
in
question
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
and
geography
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
one
thing
to
say
i
suppose
that
you
don't
have
to
go
to
new
york
to
arbitrate,
and
then
another
thing
you
say,
you
don't
have
to
arbitrate
at
all,
and
if
the
policies
of
the
miller
act
are
against
arbitration
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
as
i
say
is
one
thing
but
if
the
policy
of
the
miller
act
only
is
a
venue
protection
only,
that's
all,
there's
the
location
of
the
proceeding
then
you
would
still
have
to
arbitrate,
you
might
have
to
do
it
in
georgia?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
word
might
sometime
become
a
part
of
the
judgment
of
the
court,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
this
just
non-waivable
provision
in
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
non-waivable
provision.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
a
stay
--
there's
a
stay
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
[inaudible]
to
the
extent
of
the
--
that
arbitration
agreement
were
enforceable
law
at
all
waiver
is
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
result
in
--
probably
that
you
would
enforce
that
you've
waived
the
jury
trial,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
edenfield,
i
take
it,
your
argument
is
then
mainly
prerequisite
whether
arbitration
is
available
at
all
rather
than
to
where
it
must
take
place?
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
that
--
it
seems
to
me
that
before
you
get
through,
you
ought
to
cover
the
--
justice
black's
point
on
section
--
section
4
in
arbitration
act.
the
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
that
did
have
jurisdiction
as
the
georgia
court
and
if
you
refuse
to
arbitrate
anywhere
other
than
in
new
york,
or
if
you
refuse,
say
you
refused
to
arbitrate
at
all
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
subcontractor
wants
his
money
and
you
say,
no,
you
refuse
to
arbitrate
at
all.
if
the
subcontractor
goes
into
the
georgia
court
under
the
arbitration
act
and
gets
an
order
to
arbitrate
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
arbitration
in
that
instance
must
take
place
in
georgia
under
section
4.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
your
argument
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
it
is
not.
shan
--
i
--
i
think
that
shanferokee
simply
says
that
you
may
have
a
--
you
may
have
a
stay
and
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
--
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
about
that
because
you're
wanting
to
say,
and
the
--
the
net
result
of
your
stay
is
that
you
will
not
arbitrate
anywhere
but
in
new
york.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
in
effect
using
the
judicial
proceedings
to
enforce
arbitration
in
new
york
from
the
arbitration
act
says
that
the
arbitration
and
that
if
--
if
you
are
to
be
compelled
to
arbitrate,
it
must
take
place
within
the
district
of
the
court
that
ordered
the
arbitration.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he's
aggrieved
by
your
refusing
to
arbitrate
anywhere
but
in
new
york.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
said
--
that
he's
aggrieved
by
your
refusal
to
arbitrate
anywhere
but
in
new
york.
now,
if
he
could
go
to
--
let's
assume
now
he
goes
into
the
suit
that
he
has
now
brought
in
georgia.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
asked
that
court
to
order
you
to
arbitrate
in
georgia.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
shanferokee
involved
a
stay.
now,
what
you're
saying
is
the
policy
as
to
the
location
of
arbitration
is
different
under
section
3
than
it
is
under
section
4
and
if
you
just
get
a
stay,
the
court
stays
this
action
that
you
felt
would
agree
to
arbitrate.
now,
you
go
ahead
and
arbitrate,
where
is
that
going
to
go
into
this
lawsuit
until
you've
arbitrated.
then
--
but
it
does
order
arbitration,
you're
saying
then
that
the
arbitration
may
and
must
take
place
where
the
agreement
says
it
should
take
place.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that,
i
understand
what
the
circuit
court
said,
but
section
4
said
that
if
you
have
the
--
that
if
there's
an
order
to
arbitrate,
an
order
specifically
enforcing
an
agreement
to
arbitrate,
the
arbitration
must
take
place
in
that
district.
that's
what
section
4
says
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
it's
better
than
[inaudible]
but
it
has
mentioned
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
edenfield,
it
seems
to
me
that
one
response
to
the
section
4
argument
is
that
there
maybe
other
ways
to
have
arbitration
enforced
and
that
the
arbitration
act
would
be
exclusive
vehicle
for
enforcing
arbitration.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
we
do
need
to
talk
about
this.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
very
important
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
he
--
assuming
that
he
didn't
waive
his
claim
of
fraud
and
assuming
that
there
was
fraud
in
this
contract
not
specifically
in
regard
to
the
arbitration,
as
you
say
it
requires
[inaudible]
you
would
say
arbitration
must
go
forward
even
though
there
is
the
fraud
claim
in
the
picture.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
to
carry
that
on
through,
what
happens
in
the
arbitration
you're
seeking?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
if
it
was
sustained?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
fraud
claimed
it
be
once
and
for
all
litigated
and
decided
in
a
forum
by
the
arbitration.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
he
has
to
make
some
thing
[inaudible]
fraud?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
that's
what
you
say
but
i
assume
that
[inaudible]
i
get
your
answer
that
just
like
any
other
claim
on
the
contract,
the
arbitration
decides
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
you
--
you
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
not
only
includes
matters
arising
under
the
contract,
its
interpretation
and
its
applicability
things
like
that
but
it's
the
â€“
but
fraud
completely
[inaudible]
in
contract
antecedent
thereto
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
do
you
think
that
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
--
that
they
agree
to
arbitrate
that
kind
of
claim
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
hasn't
the
--
hasn't
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
under
this
contract,
this
fraud
issue
is
arbitrable?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
suppose
miller
act
that
nevertheless
must
take
place
in
georgia?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
only
to
say
your
[inaudible]
not
to
be
applied
in
this
case
but
that
an
arbitration
provision
in
the
contract
is
not
enforceable
in
miller
act
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
considerably
different
proposition.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you're
saying
is
that
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
in
government
construction
situation
is
not
enforceable
even
in
the
absence
of
any
agreements
to
arbitrate
outside
the
district
in
the
absence
of
fraud
or
anything
else.
that
your
position
is
simply
is
that
the
contract
to
arbitrate
is
not
enforceable
in
miller
act
cases.
