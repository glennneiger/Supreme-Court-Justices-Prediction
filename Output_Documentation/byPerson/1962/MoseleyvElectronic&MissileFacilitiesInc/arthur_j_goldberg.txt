justice
arthur
j.

the
point
there
is
that
the
surety
bond,
they
have
no
such
provision?
justice
arthur
j.

they
have
no
provision
for
arbitration?

[inaudible]
in
a
district

the
question
i
would
like
to
ask
you
is
this
[inaudible]
in
the
federal
district
court
[inaudible]
to
the
new
york
state
court
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
you
were
[inaudible]
arbitration
under
the
new
york
law.
[inaudible]
if
that
is
so
doesn't
that
mean
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
absolutely.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur

whether

[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
well
my
problem
is
this:
if
there
had
been
[inaudible]
provision,
a
general
provision
of
the
congress.
i'm
talking
about
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
by
general
provision
you
can
do
this?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
by
specific?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
assuming
there
was
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
part
of
your
argument
is
that
the
alleged
fraud
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
[inaudible]
arbitration
section
of
the
contract
is
unfair
to
them
because
it
results
in
the
fact
that
you
had
[inaudible]
as
you
said
they
have
to
go
to
new
york.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
on
a
second
thought,
would
that
still
hold
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well
assume
that
the
law
is
despite
what
this
contract
said,
the
contract
must
be
read
in
light
of
the
provision
in
several
arbitration
acts
[inaudible]
assuming
that
the
law
is
under
those
circumstances
that
the
general
contractor
is
seeking
to
deal
--
to
enforce
the
arbitration
provision.
now,
if
section
4
applies
that
the
arbitration
[inaudible]
take
place
in
georgia,
then
of
course,
how
would
you
feel
about
that?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
to
lawfully
discharge
that
section
would
apply?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
suppose
that
this
contract
provision
is
read
[inaudible].
that
i
have
read
all
the
rest
of
the
contract
and
notwithstanding,
i
go
about
the
remedy
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
no.
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
pardon?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
could
not
have.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
can
you
distinguish
between
an
agreement
and
such
outside
of
the
general
contract
[inaudible].
