mr.
george
c.
grant
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
had
reversed
a
decision
of
the
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
georgia.
the
suit
was
brought
by
moseley
or
united
states
for
the
use
of
moseley
against
electronic
and
missile
facilities,
a
defendant
who
had
performed
a
contract
at
one
of
robins
air
force
base
and
turner
air
force
base
in
georgia
for
the
construction
of
nike
hercules
facilities,
anti-missile
missile,
as
i
understand
the
construction
was
to
afford
the
site
for
the
launching
of
that
type
of
missile.
suit
was
brought
by
moseley
to
--
who
was
a
subcontractor
of
the
prime
contractor
to
recover
balances
due
to
him
and
unpaid
for
his
construction
work.
moseley
had
entered
into
a
subcontract
with
the
prime
contractor.
we
point
out
in
the
brief
that
the
subcontract
was
13
pages
of
fine
print.
in
the
record
it
takes
about
40
pages
or
so
to
print
that.
it's
a
printed
form
except
for
pa
--
a
piece
of
one
page
which
described
the
work
to
be
done
and
some
slight
changes
on
another
page
and
writing
in
their
mouths,
otherwise
it's
a
printed,
small
print
form.
mr.
george
c.
grant
this
is
a
photo
stat
of
the
contract
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
george
c.
grant
i'll
be
glad
to
test
to
the
collect,
if
i
may.
at
the
time
the
suit
was
brought
in
the
middle
--
in
the
district
court
in
macon,
georgia,
it
was
alleged
that
the
defendant
prime
contractor
had
begun
purported
arbitration
proceedings
in
the
city
of
new
york
in
connection
with
the
balance
due
to
mr.
moseley.
our
petition
was
brought
in
--
our
complaint
brought
in
six
counts,
two
of
them
seeking
to
recover
directly
on
the
contract,
the
next
--
and
the
two
contracts,
one
at
robins,
one
at
turner
air
force
base.
the
next
two
counts
seeking
to
rescind
those
contracts
because
of
fraud
of
the
prime
contractor
as
detailed
in
the
complaint,
and
seeking
thereunder
to
recover
on
quantum
meruit
for
the
value
of
the
work
done,
and
the
other
two
counts
with
respect
to
the
two
contracts
saying,
“even
if
we're
not
entitled
to
recover
on
the
letter
of
the
contract,
even
if
we
can't
show
enough
fraud
to
rescind
it
and
recover
in
quantum
meruit,
we
are
nevertheless
entitled
to
recover
the
value
of
the
work
that
was
done,
less
was
been
paid
and
any
damage
sustained
by
defendant.”
it
was
alleged
that
the
complainant
could
not
possibly
present
his
case
before
an
arbitration
board
in
the
city
of
new
york,
some
six
or
seven
hundred
miles
from
macon,
georgia
where
the
plaintiff
lived,
where
his
witnesses
resided,
where
the
government
records
were
available
by
which
he
could
prove
his
case,
and
that
he
just
simply
could
not
properly
present
his
case
before
an
arbitration
panel
even
if
it
could
be
properly
presented
if
the
evidence
were
there.
the
trial
judge
found
that
enforcement
of
a
contract
provision
purporting
to
provide
that
any
claim
or
dispute
be
settled
by
arbitration
was
contrary
to
the
public
policy
of
miller
act,
and
refused
to
grant
the
motion
of
the
defendant
for
a
stay
of
the
district
court
suit
while
arbitration
was
undertaken
in
new
york,
and
continued
to
enforce
an
injunction
against
him,
proceeding
with
the
arbitration
in
new
york.
upon
appeal
by
the
defendant
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
district
court
was
reversed
in
a
two
to
one
decision,
two
judges
holding
that
the
stay
for
arbitration
should
have
been
granted
and
judge
reeves
dissenting,
agreeing
with
the
trial
judge
that
enforcement
of
an
arbitration
provision
was
in
violation
of
the
public
policy
of
the
miller
act.
with
that
factual
background
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes.
mr.
george
c.
grant
not
insofar
as
not
permitting
him
to
read
it,
if
your
honor
please,
but
there
is
an
allegation
that
the
prime
contractor
conceived
a
scheme
to
defraud
this
subcontractor
as
well
as
all
other
subcontractors.
that
he
entered
into
the
prime
--
the
subcontract
with
the
intention
at
that
time
of
not
performing
the
one
obligation
which
he
had
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
no,
sir.
mr.
george
c.
grant
the
case
has
proceeded
on
the
pleadings
up
this
point.
mr.
george
c.
grant
there
has
been
no
trial
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
grant
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes.
mr.
george
c.
grant
well
if
--
if
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
were
being
sustained,
we
would
then
have
to
go
instead
of
trying
it
in
the
district
court
in
macon,
georgia,
we'd
have
to
go
to
new
york
to
arbitrate
the
issue
before
an
arbitration
panel
in
the
supreme
court
of
new
york.
mr.
george
c.
grant
that
--
that
has
not
been
decided.
mr.
george
c.
grant
not
under
the
court
of
appeals
decisions,
if
your
honor
please
because
the
court
of
appeals
decision
says
that
we
don't
allege
that
the
specific
provision
as
to
arbitration
was
inserted
in
it
by
fraud
that
that
was
obtained
by
fraud
and
that
even
you
think
it's
true
the
allegation
that
the
whole
contract
was
a
fraudulent
scheme,
that
still
the
arbitration
provision
would
be
enforced.
it
is
what
the
majority
opinion
says.
mr.
george
c.
grant
no
sir,
but
i
take
it
what
it
means
is
that
we'd
have
to
try
that
fraud
question
not
before
the
district
court
but
up
here
before
an
arbitration
panel
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
whole
contract
was
entered
into
by
fraud.
and
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes
sir
and
if
they
were
entered
into
by
fraud,
it's
my
contention
there
is
no
contract,
there
is
no
arbitration
provision
because
if
the
contract
is
void
because
of
fraud
then
every
provision
in
it
including
that
for
arbitration
is
void.
and
we
shouldn't
be
up
in
new
york
deciding
fraud
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
contract
because
the
only
way
we
can
get
to
new
york
if
is
--
there
is
a
valid
contract
which
contains
a
valid
and
forceful
arbitration
provision.
mr.
george
c.
grant
i
didn't
understand
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
grant
my
pro
--
my
primary
point
is
that
arbitration
at
all
is
contrary
to
terms
of
miller
act.
mr.
george
c.
grant
well,
the
geography
accentuates
the
extent
to
which
our
substantive
rights
would
be
destroyed
by
arbitrating
rather
the
findings
of
the
court.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
it
just
wouldn't
be
as
clear
the
extent
to
which
our
rights
would
be
taken
away
by
arbitration.
if
we
could
do
it
in
macon,
well
the
witness
--
well
we
wouldn't
have
the
additional
burden
of
not
being
able
to
get
the
evidence
to
the
arbitration
board.
mr.
george
c.
grant
i
would
make
the
same
argument,
your
honor,
because
i
take
the
position
that
the
insertion
of
that
provision
is
exactly
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
the
miller
act.
and
i
was
going
to
proceed
to
that
in
a
moment,
to
point
out
that
my
client
did
sign
the
contract
and
it
does
say
that
among
all
its
other
provisions
which
i
have
passed
up
there.
mr.
george
c.
grant
i
am
not
waving
that.
i
don't
think
that
applies,
if
your
honor
please.
this
contract
provides
not
to
be
done
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
well,
there's
--
in
this
case
no
proceeding
to
compel
arbitration
but
there's
a
pro
--
a
motion
under
section
3
of
the
arbitration
act
to
stay
the
suit
while
arbitration
you
carry
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
c.
grant
[inaudible]
mr.
george
c.
grant
well
it's
conceivable
that
that
might
be
the
result.
i
don't
see
how
under
the
--
under
the
arbitration
act
if
it
apply,
it
provides
that
you
stay
the
suit
while
you
arbitrate
them
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
contract
as
i
understand.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes.
mr.
george
c.
grant
that's
my
primary
argument.
mr.
george
c.
grant
well,
we
certainly
take
both
positions,
your
honor.
that
we
should
not
be
compelled
to
arbitrate
but
on
top
of
that,
we
shouldn't
be
compelled
to
leave
state
of
georgia.
i
was
about
to
mention
the
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes
sir.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes
sir.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes
sir.
mr.
george
c.
grant
well
the
only
ones
dealt
with
in
this
record
are
two
in
georgia.
one
at,
one
at
robins
air
base,
in
fact
their
two
sites,
one
on
each
side
of
the
air
base
about
15
to
20
miles
on
each
side,
and
two
sites
about
15
to
20
miles
on
each
side
of
the
air
base
at
albany,
georgia.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
sir.
we
have
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
i
believe
that
the
record
does
show
that,
your
honor.,
that
some
did.
certainly,
i
would
think
a
majority
to
keep
in
georgia
but
some
--
the
record
show
it
some
keep
them
off
the
states.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
c.
grant
no,
sir.
mr.
george
c.
grant
the
facts
as
we
expect
to
development
them,
your
honor
asked
me
outside
the
record
is
that
they
were
awarded
the
contract
on
a
low
bid.
that
then
they
sent
what
i
will
call
a
“pressure
team”
into
georgia
to
view
people
down,
work
them
down
into
the
lowest
amount
they
could
get
a
heating
contract
or
plumbing
contract
to
itself.
get
the
lowest
price
they
can
get
from
any
one
man
and
sign
up
with
him
that
there
had
no
bids
prior
to
entering
their
own
bid
for
the
prime
contract.
but
that
they
first
entered
a
bid,
were
awarded
the
contract
and
then
undertook
--
get
the
lowest
price
they
could
as
to
each
of
the
separate
items.
mr.
george
c.
grant
well,
i
would
have
thought
the
customary
procedure,
your
honor
is
to
obtain
bids
from
subcontract
is
on
the
basis
of
which
to
form
your
own
bid
in
arriving
at
a
price
for
which
you
do
the
work
from
the
government
and
then
if
you
get
the
contract
your
serve
has
a
contract
also
and
knows
it
to
begin
with
it.
this
would
--
the
shop
observes
at
beginning
the
contract
as
my
understanding
by
the
way.
mr.
george
c.
grant
in
macon,
georgia
by
reserve
and
then
sent
to
new
york,
and
they
send
it
back
sometime
later
as
i
understand
it
after
renegotiating
it.
i
believe
those
facts
are
not
in
the
record
and
i'm
talking
entirely
from
my
recollection,
if
i'm
wrong
i
would
apologize.
mr.
george
c.
grant
that
is
--
that
is
my
understanding,
all
i
think
there
was
some
transmission
back
and
forth
that
he
signed
it
in
--
when
one
of
them
came
back
and
the
--
maybe
get
him
to
reduce
it's
price
on
them,
i'm
not
sure
of
that
though.
but
i
was
about
to
say
that
this
--
the
miller
act
was
adopted
in
1935
as
the
successor
of
the
heard
act
which
was
repealed
by
the
adoption
of
the
miller
act.
the
heard
act
had
required
just
one
bond
for
the
benefit
of
the
government
to
ensure
performance
of
the
contract
and
for
the
benefit
of
laborers
and
materialmen.
and
experience
under
that
act
had
developed
that
the
laborers
and
materialmen
had
to
wait
a
long
time
in
many
cases
before
being
paid.
and
if
they
had
to
settle
meritorious
claims
for
less
than
was
due
them
because
they
needed
the
money
and
that's
pointed
it
out
by
one
decision
of
this
court
which
i
cite
in
the
brief.
and
so
the
miller
act
came
along
and
provided
two
bonds,
one
for
the
benefit
of
the
government
itself
to
ensure
that
the
contract
would
be
performed,
another
bond
for
the
benefit
of
laborers
and
materialmen
to
ensure
that
they
would
be
paid,
that
there
would
a
solvent
surety
in
the
event
the
contractor
did
not.
and
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
point
out
that
the
purpose
of
the
miller
act
was
to
facilitate
the
collection
of
money
and
then
facilitate
suit
by
the
unpaid
laborers
and
materialmen.
in
the
case
of
mcavoy
versus
united
states
this
court
pointed
out,
the
miller
act
while
they
repeal
the
heard
act,
reinstated
these
basic
provisions
and
was
designed
primarily
to
eliminate
certain
procedural
limitations
on
its
beneficiaries.
there
was
no
express
purpose
in
the
legislative
history
to
restrict
in
anyway
the
courage
of
the
heard
act.
the
intent
rather
was
to
remove
the
procedural
difficulties
found
to
exist
under
the
earlier
measure
and
thereby
make
it
easier
for
unpaid
creditors
to
realize
the
benefit
of
the
bonds.
and
this
court
goes
further
to
point
out
that
under
the
heard
act
serious
inconveniences
and
delays
resulted
to
this
claimant.
they
claimants
often
in
need
of
immediate
funds
were
compelled
to
settle
meritorious
claims
for
less
than
the
full
amount,
that's
quoting
from
this
decision
of
this
court.
the
miller
act
was
designed
to
meet
these
difficulties.
so
what
did
they
do
to
meet
it?
there
are
two
things
to
guard
against
in
entering
into
a
contract
involving
performance
by
another
party.
the
first
thing
is
the
financial
responsibility
of
the
person
you're
contracting
with.
he
may
be
unable
financially
to
carry
out
his
obligations.
to
avoid
that
congress
provided
that
this
contract
that
must
give
a
bond
by
a
solvent
surety.
the
other
thing
you
have
to
worry
about
in
dealing
with
somebody
else
is
going
to
do
certain
performance
is
his
innate
honesty
or
his
willingness
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
contract
that
he
enters
into.
and
to
guard
against
that
the
miller
act
inserted
a
provision
and
that
is
the
provision
giving
the
right
to
unpaid
laborers
and
materialmen
to
sue
but
they
didn't
stop
with
the
provisions
that
they
shall
have
the
right
to
sue.
congress
went
further
and
a
put
provisions
in
there
that
i
don't
know
if
any
other
act
passed
that
a
person
unpaid
who
has
furnished
labor
and
material
shall
have
the
right
to
sue
and
to
prosecute
said
action
to
final
execution
and
judgment.
those
words
were
deliberately
inserted
by
congress,
we
say,
to
give
efficacy
to
the
right
to
sue
which
they'd
otherwise
provided.
we're
dealing
here
with
a
subcontractor,
a
man
who's
furnishing
the
plumbing
and
heating
work,
a
man
who's
a
local
plumber,
who
enters
into
a
contract
with
these
people
to
furnish
the
plumbing
and
heating
work,
but
it
should
be
more
borne
in
mind
in
dealing
with
this
act
that
it
applies
not
only
to
subcontractors
that
we
are
talking
about
here,
but
it
applies
to
the
lowliest
laborer,
a
man
who
may
be
working
for
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
an
hour,
doing
some
of
the
plumbing
or
who
may
be
sweeping
the
floor
for
this
general
contractor,
it
applies
just
as
well
to
him.
mr.
george
c.
grant
what
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
to
do
the
plumbing
and
heating

mr.
george

facilities,

of

yes,
it's
really
to
house
equipment,
more
than
anything
else.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
c.
grant
not
except
to
the
extent
that
materials
may
have
been
received
from
--
shipped
from
out
of
state
there.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
grant
it
was
decided
in
both
places
on
--
in
the
trial
court.
that
court
said
is
not
necessary
to
decide
it
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
that
it
doesn't
matter,
that
the
miller
act
just
make
this
idea
of
being
able
to
arbitrate
and
the
arbitration
act
doesn't
apply.
now
the
circuit
court
decides
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
no,
sir.
it
doesn't
have,
as
broad
definition
as
does
in
the
--
in
a
number
of
these
other
acts.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes.
mr.
george
c.
grant
i
am
arguing
that,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
but
i
am
arguing
that
even
if
we
are
in
commerce
that
it
doesn't
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
c.
grant
there
is
an
addition
to
the
contract
providing
that
the
certain
act
would
be
observed
as
i
recall
it
and
i
assume
that
they
were,
although
there's
another
case
which
my
brother
in
the
opposition
cite
where
the
same
--
where
your
honor
has
set
to
labor
brought
an
injunction
suit
against
them
to
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
because
they
weren't
complying
with
it
at
the
time
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
it's
in
your
name,
your
honor.
it's
goldberg
versus
electronic
missile
facilities
or
[inaudible]
construction
corporation
that
used
to
be
known
as
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
i
think
fair
labor
standards
act
what
they
were
talking
to
violating
is
my
recollection.
mr.
george
c.
grant
i
don't
know
if
it's
under
that
law,
your
honor.
the
cases
that
i'm
referring
to
was
merely
as
i
understand
an
injunction
against
violating
the
fair
labor
standards
act
for
failing
to
pay
the
minimum
wages
and
overtime
is
a
suit
that
we
were
put
to
that
being
cited
in
respondents'
brief.
mr.
george
c.
grant
well
then
that
certainly
had
to
be
holding
that
company
was
engaged
in
it
on
that
particular
project
which
was
not
this
one
we're
talking
about.
and
i
think
there's
a
great
distinction
between
the
case
there
involved
where
they
were
building
something
to
be
added
to
some
base
that
was
already
there.
and
this
court
has
clearly
held
when
you
building
an
addition
to
existing
facilities
already
engaged
in
commerce
that
then
that
construction
work
comes
within
it
but
they
haven't
ever
overruled
so
far
as
i
know
or
modified
the
decision
where
it
says,
where
as
purely
new
--
brand
new
construction
and
not
an
addition
to
an
existing
facility
that
is
not
covered
by
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
c.
grant
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
fair
labors
standards
act
has
long
definition
including
communications
and
various
other
things
whereas
the
arbitrations
act
defines
commerce
as
herein
defined,
means
commerce
among
the
sale
of
states
so
far
a
nation
or
in
any
territory
of
the
united
states
or
in
district
of
columbia,
or
between
one
territory
or
another
and
so
forth.
it
doesn't
have
all
these
other
ramifications
of
affecting
commerce
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
it
did
not
incorporate
that.
mr.
george
c.
grant
no,
sir.
and
it
provides
it
--
provision
in
a
maritime
transaction
all
contract
evidencing
transactions
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
no,
i've
reading
the
language
or
contract
evidencing
of
the
transaction
involving
commerce
is
what
the
act
applies
to,
but
in
getting
to
the
point
of
whether
or
not
the
man
signed
the
contract
with
that
provision
in
there
and
he
did.
i
was
pointing
out
that
this
act
applies
not
just
to
subcontractors
who
are
plumbing
and
heating
men
but
to
day
laborers,
men
who
out
there
pushing
a
shovel
for
electronic
and
missile
facilities,
all
for
the
subcontractor
and
everybody
else
who's
furnishing
material.
it
applies
to
every
single
laborer
and
materialmen
and
if
the
electronic
and
missile
facilities
can
get
up
a
planted
subcontract
form
of
that
kind
and
require
every
subcontractor
who
deals
with
them
to
sign
on
that
form,
then
by
the
same
token
they
can
require
every
laborer
who
is
on
their
payroll
to
sign
an
agreement
that
any
dispute
we
got
or
any
claim
for
unpaid
wages
will
be
brought
not
as
the
miller
act
says,
but
up
in
new
york,
put
to
be
arbitrated,
every
laborer
can
be
required
to
sign
that.
it
can
require
every
subcontractor
as
a
part
of
this
planted
thing
they
make
him
sign
to
get
that
kind
of
agreement
from
all
the
laborers
who
work
for
him
and
furnish
it
to
the
prime
contractor
that
every
claim
of
any
laborer
against
the
subcontractor
it
must
be
brought
in
new
york.
they
can
require
that
subcontractor
to
get
a
similar
agreement
from
every
person
who
furnishes
material
to
that
subcontractor,
but
they
can
go
further,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
that,
your
honor.
i
--
certainly
it
was
not
represented
by
me
at
that
time.
i
understand
that
the
he
had
some
lawyer
to
phrase
for
him
the
writing
that's
on
the
last
page
setting
out
what
he
is
to
do.
this
really
set
out
and
i
don't
know
if
the
evidence
will
show
the
lawyer
saw
this
thing.
it
was
to
be
added
to
but
put
in
the
words
from
these
other
things
that
it
was
not
covered.
mr.
george
c.
grant
the
rate
or
the
amounts
were
about
$200,000
in
each
place,
your
honor.
about
$400,000
there
are
various
extras
and
various
other
work
that
was
done
to
bring
the
total
up
to
sum
about
what
your
honor
mentioned.
mr.
george
c.
grant
we'll
see
it
now
--
i
don't
want
you
on
a
misapprehension.
you
didn't
bring
one
--
i
think
in
the
work
they
were
doing
down
in
georgia.
it
was
somewhere
off
in
puerto
rico.
it
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
i
say
it
was
different
type
of
work.
here
they
are
building
a
brand
new
missile
facility,
out
there
in
the
country
where
there's
nothing
before.
it's
20
miles
from
the
base.
in
the
one
way,
your
honor
brought
the
suit,
they
were
adding
something
to
a
base
in
puerto
rico
as
i
understand.
they
were
adding
something
to
a
place
already
in
existence.
mr.
george
c.
grant
not
this
one
at
all.
mr.
george
c.
grant
not
my
client.
these
folks
i'm
suing
the
elec
--
electronic
--
yes,
the
prime
contractor,
electronic
and
missile
facilities,
they
do
business
all
around.
we
allege
in
this
complaint
that
they
are
nothing
but
brokers,
that
they
don't
have
any
of
workmen
themselves.
they
get
a
job
and
they
palm
it
out
in
subcontract
every
single
item
of
it
and
require
every
subcontractor
to
whom
they
have
served
it
to
sign
one
of
these
forms.
and
i
say
it
if
they
can
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
i,
i
allege
that
they
--
there
is
a
time
they
got
the
contract
and
entered
into
the
contract
with
mr.
mosley,
that
they
had
no
intention
of
performing
the
proper
function
of
a
general
contract
of
supervising
and
coordinating
the
work
of
the
various
subcontractors.
but
if
they
subcontracted
every
single
item
of
the
work
and
that
they
went
so
far
is
to
lay
--
and
sweeping
out
a
building
to
prorate
the
cost
of
doing
that
between
all
of
the
subcontractors
on
the
job.
it
ostensibly
but
that
in
fact
they
charged
the
total
cost
of
sweeping
out
a
building
to
every
single
one
to
subcontractors.
we
allege
that,
we
allege
that
it's
a
fraudulent
scheme
from
beginning
to
end
to
obtain
work
and
materials
without
paying
for
it
or
if
they
had
to
pay
anything
to
browbeat
the
people
who
worked
for
them
down
to
taking
less
than
they
had
earned
in
order
to
avoid
going
off
to
new
york
and
arbitrate.
and
that
one
of
the
means
by
which
they
intended
to
carry
this
scheme
into
effect
was
this
arbitration
provision
that's
in
here.
mr.
george
c.
grant
the
court
of
appeals
say
we
haven't
alleged
how
we
going
to
be
hurt.
mr.
george
c.
grant
how
are
we
going
to
be
hurt
by
arbitration
in
new
york
instead
of
trying
in
the
district
court
in
macon,
georgia
although,
it's
decided
on
the
pleadings
and
we
make
the
allegations
in
the
pleading
of
this
fraudulent
schemes
and
we
make
the
allegation
that
we
could
not
properly
prevent
our
plan
before
an
arbitration
panel
in
new
york
for
reasons
that
i've
already
mentioned.
and
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
point
out
very
distinctly
the
difference
in
the
substantive
rights
of
the
parties
that
may
result
from
proceeding
by
arbitration
rather
in
the
court
of
law
and
that
was
done
in
the
case
of
barnhart
versus
polygraphic
company
in
hundredth
law
edition
when
i
use
it
refer
to
350
u.s.
that
is
the
recent
decision.
they
rendered
it
by
arbitration,
whatever
its
merits
or
shortcomings,
it
substantially
affects
the
cause
of
action,
the
nature
of
the
tribunal
where
a
suit
is
tried
is
a
--
is
an
important
part
of
the
parcel
of
rights
behind
the
cause
of
action.
change
from
a
court
of
law
to
an
arbitration
panel
may
make
a
radical
difference
and
ultimate
results.
and
in
no
point
in
my
reading
further
from
that
that's
in
the
brief
but
i
wanted
to
invite
the
court's
attention
this
time
to
the
fact
there
is
such
a
radical
difference
in
the
substantive
rights
in
the
final
outcome
between
whether
you
travel
by
a
court
suit
or
by
arbitration.
and
then
they
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
language
of
the
miller
act
itself
when
we
are
talking
about
the
background
of
it
and
the
heard
act
in
its
deficiencies
permitting
people
to
be
delayed
who
were
entitled
to
their
money
and
the
fact
that
congress
intended
to
correct
that
deficiency
by
enactment
of
the
miller
act,
and
then
that
they
put
into
it
language
that
won't
be
found
in
any
other
statute.
and
i
think
it's
significant
that
in
this
case,
in
the
brief
of
respondent
just
as
in
the
circuit
court
opinion,
they
dwell
at
length
doing
that
part
of
the
miller
act
which
says
that
every
suit
shall
be
brought
in
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
district
in
which
work
were
to
be
performed
and
not
elsewhere,
but
the
brief
of
respondent
doesn't
text
these
words
which
to
me
are
unequivocal.
it's
set
out
that
they
keep
me
stay
because
they
say
if
a
man
had
--
the
act
itself
says
every
person,
and
we're
talking
about
laborers,
subcontractor,
materialmen
who
is
furnished
labor
and
material
and
who
hadn't
been
paid
in
90
days
shall
have
the
right
to
sue
on
such
payment
bond
for
the
amount
or
the
balance
they
have
unpaid
at
the
time
of
the
institution
[inaudible]
and
to
prosecute
said
action
to
final
execution
in
judgment
for
the
sum
or
sums
just
and
due
to
him.
now
if
congress
had
every
intended
that
you
had
a
right
to
sue
but
after
[inaudible]
suit,
you
had
to
set
it
aside
and
let
it
be
stayed
while
you
ran
off
up
to
new
york
and
arbitrate,
if
it
eventuated
in
search
result
then
those
words
would
have
been
put
in
there,
they
would
have
stop
by
saying,
“shall
have
the
right
sue”.
mr.
george
c.
grant
it
might,
your
honor.
and
they
could
have
accomplished
that
result
by
simply
saying
he
shall
have
the
right
to
sue.
but
to
evidence
the
fact
that
that
suit
was
to
go
forward
and
not
to
be
sidetracked
to
stop.
they
added
the
words,
“and
prosecute
set
action
to
final
execution
of
the
judgment.”
and
prosecute
means
to
carry
on,
it
means
the
exact
opposite
of
stay.
to
stay
a
suit
means
wait
a
while
as
i
use
to
say
in
the
country
stay
means
wait
and
prosecute
means
carry
on
or
get
up
as
we
said
to
amicus.
they're
the
exact
opposite.
you
can't
prosecute
it
to
a
final
execution
excuse
in
judgment
if
it
stayed
and
those
words
were
deliberately
inserted
by
congress.
because
in
not
any
of
act,
they
weren't
in
heard
act,
they
would
try
to
overcome
difficulties
and
they
put
this
words
which
we
must
say
congress
intended
to
have
a
meaning.
mr.
george
c.
grant
none,
what?
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes.
that
--
that's
my
exact
point,
that
a
man
can't
waive
those.
and
we
cite
in
the
brief
a
number
of
cases
where
this
court
has
held
and
where
a
new
right
is
created
by
congress
in
the
public
interest,
in
those
to
private
right.
that
that
private
right
cannot
be
waived
where
to
do
so
would
thwart
the
purpose
of
congress.
and
it's
our
contention
that
congress
intended
that
people
be
paid
who
do
work
on
government
contracts.
and
that
they
not
be
put
off,
so
that
they'll
have
financial
pressure
applied
and
have
to
settle
for
less
but
that
they
be
paid
promptly.
that's
a
provision
of
the
bond
that
they
would
be
paid
promptly
and
they
provide
this
solvent
surety
in
order
that
they
won't
be
insolvency
to
confront
them.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
c.
grant
because
we,
we
have
alleged
that
we
can't
prevent
these
issues
before
an
arbitration
panel.
and
this
court
has
pointed
out
that
arbitrators
are
not
in
conversant
with
the
law.
they
wouldn't
know
what
to
do
with
this
allegation
of
fraud
we've
got.
if
it
was
a
simple
question
of
the
term
that
whether
the
old
490,000
or
472,000
an
arbitrator
might
decide,
but
an
arbitration
panel
could
not
determine
and
i
say
this
question
as
to
whether
the
defendant,
prime
contractor
acting
with
such
fraud
in
entering
into
a
contract,
he
had
no
intention
of
performing
as
to
entitle
as
to
rescind
that
contract.
that's
a
fairly
complicated
legal
issue
that
i
say
arbitration
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
it
provides
that
it
be
done
before
--
in
accordance
with
the
practice
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
york,
it's
on
page
42
of
the
record,
the
provision
of
the
contract
with
respect
that.
any
controversy
or
claim
arising
out
of
or
relating
to
this
agreement
or
the
briefs
thereof
and
i
point
out
that
it
doesn't
have
to
--
you
don't
have
to
have
any
dispute,
you
just
have
to
have
a
claim,
say
they
owe
you
some
money.
provision
for
the
termination
of
which
not
made
elsewhere
in
this
agreement,
shall
be
settled
by
arbitration
in
the
borough
of
manhattan
city
in
the
state
of
new
york
in
accordance
with
the
civil
practice
act
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
then
they
go
on
to
provide
another
in
the
event
that
will
work
some
other
kind
of
arbitration
by
the
american
arbitration
association.
in
subparagraph
(c)
they
purport
to
provide
that
either
party
can
bring
in
other
parties.
now
whether
they
try
to
incorporate
in
this,
what
is
the
equivalent
of
a
third
party
plaintiff
in
defendant
proceeding
in
the
civil
procedure
of
the
federal
courts.
mr.
george
c.
grant
some
of
them
do
have
that
kind.
mr.
george
c.
grant
there
is
not
a
provision
specifically
prohibiting
waiver
of
the
rights.
mr.
george
c.
grant
i
don't
for
two
reasons
if
i
may
answer
that
way,
mr.
justice
brennan.
first,
the
language
that
they
shall
have
the
right
to
prosecute
it,
to
final
action
and
judgment
is
so
clear
to
me
that
it
can't
be
stopped,
that
it's
opposite
of
being
stayed
that
it
weren't
necessary
to
put
that
in.
but
secondly,
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
brooklyn
savings
bank
versus
o'neil,
where
the
same
argument
was
made
with
respect
of
the
fair
labors
standards
act,
that
these
other
acts
had
prohibitions
against
waiving
different
things.
and
if
this
one
didn't
and
this
court
says
absence
of
such
provisions
has
not
prevented
the
court
from
invalidating
waiver
where
the
legislative
policy
would
be
brought
in
by
permitting
such
contracts.
the
decision
is
to
the
case
is
based
on
the
legislative
policy
behind
the
enactment.
and
that
were
said
in
answer
to
an
argument,
that
this
fair
labor
standards
act
did
not
contain
this
prohibition
against
waiver
that
was
in
these
other
acts
to
which
your
honor
referred.
but
the
court
answered
it
by
saying
if
the
legislative
policy
is
clear
and
would
be
voided
by
the
kind
of
waiver
that
the
parties
have
attempted
to
agree
to
then
we
just
won't
permit
it.
if
it
violates,
it
thwarts
the
purpose
of
congress
and
that's
our
contention
here.
it's
two-fold.
it's
so
clear
in
the
miller
act
that
they
didn't
need
to
say
it.
certainly
if
you
can
develop
a
policy
with
that
respect
to
some
prohibition,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
in
there
and
that
this
court
has
said
so
in
that
case.
mr.
george
c.
grant
there
was
not
in
this
fair
labor
standards
act
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
--
according
to
that
decision.
in
that
case
it
was
argued
that
congress
did
not
intend
for
such
a
waive
of
rights
to
be
void
because
it
had
in
other
acts
specifically
provided,
that
waive
of
rights
there
granted
would
be
void
but
had
not
so
provided
in
this
act.
mr.
george
c.
grant
and
in
rejecting
this
contention
this
court
said,
“absence
of
such
provision
however
has
not
prevented
the
court
from
invalidating
waivers,
where
the
legislative
policy
would
be
thwarted
by
permitting
such
contracts.”
the
decision
in
the
instant
case
is
based
on
the
legislative
policy
behind
this
enactment
and
there
the
waiver
was
signed
after
all
rights
had
accrued,
which
to
my
mind
is
a
tremendous
difference
between
waiving
all
your
rights
in
advance
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
there
dealt
with
in
that
case.
the
time
had
been
worked
for
which
the
man
should
have
been
paid
more
money
and
over
time.
and
they
had
paid
him
all
of
that
and
at
that
time
had
got
him
to
agree
to
waive
the
overtime
provisions
and
so
forth.
and
the
court
said
even
though
the
rights
had
accrued,
he
couldn't
waive
them
even
though
the
statute
doesn't
say
you
can't
waive
them.
but
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
the
act,
it
would
violate
the
policy
that
congress
had
in
mind
if
you
were
permitted
to
waive.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
that's
the
argument
i'm
making,
except
that
i'm
emphasizing
or
undertaking
to
do
so
that
congress
didn't
stop
with
just
giving
them
the
right
to
sue,
but
that
they
specifically
said
they
shall
have
the
right
to
prosecute
that
action
to
final
execution
and
judgment,
which
to
my
mind
means
they
had
in
mind
the
provisions
of
arbitration
law
which
was
passed
ten
years
before
then
and
saying
that
this
suit
is
not
one
to
be
stayed.
it's
to
be
prosecuted
to
final
execution
and
judgment
that
that's
the
only
difference
i
make
between
your
honor's
statement
of
what
i
am
trying
to
argue
and
the
way
your
honor
stated.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
it
does.
mr.
george
c.
grant
well
if
were
applied
though,
your
honor
our
suit
would
sit
down
in
the
district
court
in
macon
instead
of
being
prompt
to
tried,
it
was
set
and
we
go
off
to
new
york
and
i
don't
know
how
long
it
would
take
to
resolve
all
these
issues
there
and
then
get
it
reduced
to
an
award
and
come
back
to
the
district
court
in
macon,
georgia
and
ask
them
for
a
judgment
based
on
this
award
that
was
obtained.
and
if
we
succeeded
before
the
arbitration
panel
in
establishing
our
contention
that
the
whole
contract
was
fraudulent
and
then
therefore
void
then
the
arbitration
panel
would
have
to
stop
at
making
that
finding
then
we
come
back
to
the
district
court
and
try
the
whole
case
over.
mr.
george
c.
grant
well
because
of
my
contention
that
an
arbitration
panel
is
not
instructed
in
the
law.
they
don't
have
instructions
on
the
law.
there's
no
judge
to
tell
them
what
the
law
is
with
respect
to
a
particular
set
of
facts.
and
that's
been
pointed
out
by
the
decisions
of
this
court,
that
that
makes
the
substantive
difference
between
the
rights
of
parties
proceeding
in
a
court
and
proceeding
before
an
arbitration
panel.
they
might
decide
that
[inaudible]
or
not.
there's
no
judge
there
to
tell
them
that
if
there
this
certain
prompt
doesn't
the
contract
is
that
to
me.
they
are
layman,
they're
not
learned
in
the
law
and
there's
no
way
to
make
that
point
properly
speaking
to
an
arbitration
board
is
what
i
am
contending.
mr.
george
c.
grant
well
in
that
view
i'm
adopting
the
language
of
this
court,
pointing
out
that
distinct.
i
think
wherever
it's
important
that
the
law
be
applied,
complicated
legal
issues
be
determined
as
opposed
to
simple
fact
issues
that
you
do
have
that
difficulty
in
an
arbitration.
mr.
george
c.
grant
that's
been
repeatedly
pointed
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
the
circuit
courts.
that
was
purpose
of
it
to
make
it
easier,
to
overcome
these
delays
that
result
under
the
heard
act
where
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes.
mr.
george
c.
grant
that's
exactly
how
our
contention,
may
it
please
the
court.
and
there
--
if
i
can
quickly
name
these
fats
that
would
be
result
from
permitting
arbitrations
to
have
a
suit,
first
place
the
surety
is
not
bound
by
the
arbitration,
he's
not
a
party
to
it.
you
might
participate
in
an
arbitration
to
get
an
award
and
the
surety
that
won't
pay
it
then
you
got
to
sue
in
the
district
court,
still
nevertheless
the
surety
can
litigate
the
same
issues
all
over
again.
and
yet
if
you
lose
before
the
arbitration
panel,
you
are
concluded
and
you
got
no
claim
left
against
the
surety,
that's
one
important
thing
--
distinction.
the
second
is
that
there's
a
time
limit
in
the
miller
act
of
one
year
from
the
last
days
you
furnish
material
or
labor
within
which
your
suit
in
the
district
court
must
be
brought
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
he
is
not
a
part
of
the
contract.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes
sir,
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
how
that
could
possibly
be
enforced
as
against
another
party
who
was
not
for
it.
mr.
george
c.
grant
well
i
mean
this
is
in
new
york
and
i
don't
know
if
that
surety
is
up
there,
that
new
york
could
have
got
a
jurisdiction
of
that
surety.
and
certainly
he
and
i
can
agree
that
a
new
york
court
got
jurisdiction
to
somebody
else,
who
is
not
up
there,
i
mean
who
is
not
a
part
of
that
contract.
mr.
george
c.
grant
the
surety
bond?
mr.
george
c.
grant
it's
required
to
have
the
provision
set
out
by
the
statute,
if
it
please
the
court.
and
there
is
even
a
regulations
setting
out
the
very
wedding
of
a
bond,
running
to
the
united
states
of
america.
i
mentioned
there's
a
time
limit
within
which
you
must
bring
a
suit
to
the
district
court,
that's
one
year.
and
a
man
must
bring
a
suit
even
if
you
say
it
can
be
stayed
for
arbitration
because
his
time
would
run
out
while
he's
off
somewhere
arbitrating.
therefore,
he's
got
to
go
to
new
york.
he's
got
to
hire
two
sets
of
lawyer,
one
in
macon,
georgia
and
some
more
in
new
york
to
handle
the
arbitration
provision.
i
have
mentioned
that
if
this
were
valid
the
prime
contractor
could
require
every
laborer
to
sign
the
similar
agreement
and
could
require
his
subcontractor
to
get
a
similar
agreement
from
everyone,
his
laborers
and
materialmen.
and
that
the
surety
could
impose
as
a
requirement
for
his
writing
the
bond
that
the
prime
contract
to
punish
him
such
agreement
from
all
the
subs
and
all
materialmen
of
off's
and
so
forth.
finally,
this
is
a
suit
by
the
united
states.
it's
not
a
suit
just
by
motive.
it
was
decided
under
the
heard
act
which
preceded
this.
that
the
united
states
itself
is
so
much
interested
in
the
preservation
and
protection
of
the
rights
granted
by
the
statute
that
it
is
not
just
a
nominal,
but
a
real
point
to
such
a
suit
brought
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
for
the
use
of
the
materialmen.
that
was
held
in
the
united
states
fidelity
and
guaranty
company
versus
united
states
of
america
and
i'm
sorry
this
case
is
not
on
my
brief
in
204
u.s.
349
where
this
court
pointed
out
the
united
states
is
not
here
nearly
no
--
nominal
or
formal
party.
although
this
was
a
suit
on
the
heard
act
just
like
this.
it
has
the
legal
right.
it
was
a
principle
party
to
the
contract
and
in
view
of
the
words
of
the
statute
maybe
said
to
have
an
interest
in
the
performance
of
all
of
its
provisions.
it
maybe
that
the
interest
of
the
government
has
involved
in
the
construction
of
public
works
will
be
[inaudible]
if
contracts
to
this
for
such
works
are
able
to
obtain
materials
and
supplies
with
certainty
and
prompt,
to
that
end
congress
may
have
been
that
important
to
assure
those
who
furnish
such
material
or
supplies
that
the
government
would
exert
its
power
directly
for
their
protection.
it
may
well
have
thought
that
the
government
was
under
some
obligation
to
guard
the
interest
of
those
whose
labor
and
materials
would
go
into
a
public
building.
that
same
thing
applicable
to
the
heard
act
is
even
more
applicable
to
the
miller
act
because
this
court
has
said
the
reason
for
the
miller
act
was
to
remove
some
of
these
procedural
difficulties
and
to
make
it
easier
for
unpaid
laborers
and
materialmen
to
realize
the
benefit
of
this
bond.
one
of
the
circuit
courts
has
characterized
a
bond
on
which
you
can't
sue
as
being
an
empty
gesture
and
a
[inaudible]
carried
out
by
the
contractor
in
the
surety
of
public
expense
and
that
certainly
would
be
true
as
to
the
bond
here.
if
we
can't
sue
the
surety
but
must
go
up
to
new
york
and
engage
in
an
arbitration
fight
with
the
prime.
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
george
c.
grant
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
make
reply
to
some
observations
made
by
mr.
edenfield
and
first,
i
will
address
myself
to
his
last
argument
that
there
was
a
waiver
of
the
fraud
by
continuing
to
perform
the
contract.
it's
specifically
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
set
out
on
page
64
of
the
record,
moseley
had
no
knowledge
of
the
fraudulent
and
illegal
scheme
plan
and
design
as
herein
alleged
and
is
specified
in
subparagraphs
a,
b,
c,
d,
e,
f
and
g
hereof
until
after
he
had
completed
his
performance
under
the
contract
and
then
begin
to
receive
from
the
defendant
contractor
a
flood
of
bills
for
alleged
back
charges
and
denials
for
the
first
time
of
plaintiff's
claims
for
compensation
for
work
done
by
him
which
was
not
covered
by
the
term
of
the
contract.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
sir.
i
definitely
argue
that,
your
honor.
i
argue
it
because
we
allege
that
this
contract
--
in
preparing
this
contract
and
then
entering
into
it,
set
out
with
a
fraudulent
scheme
to
obtain
money
and
materials
without
paying
for
it
all
with
--
if
he
had
to
pay
--
to
pay
a
such
a
reduced
price
as
he
can
get
the
subcontractors
to
take
because
of
threats
to
take
them
off
to
other
places
and
so
forth.
and
that
he
can
see
--
this
whole
contract,
13
pages
of
fine
print,
hadn't
got
but
one
single
thing
in
it
that
the
main
contractor
promises
to
do,
every
other
paragraph
as
an
agreement
that
the
subcontractor
shall
not,
but
his
one
obligation
was
to
pay
and
to
pay
promptly
under
that
provision.
and
we
say
he
conceived
this
scheme
to
avoid
that
payment
and
that
one
means
by
which
he
intended
to
avoid
it
was
by
use,
by
insertion
of
and
use
of
this
arbitration
provision
that
when
a
claim
arose
and
the
man
says,
“i'm
entitled
of
$90,000
you
haven't
paid”,
that
he
would
say,
“well,
i'm
not
going
to
pay
you.
i'm
going
to
take
you
to
new
york
and
we'll
go
arbitrate
it
up
there”
and
we
specifically
allege
in
our
complaint
that
our
man
would
not
be
able
to
take
the
witnesses
to
new
york.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes.
mr.
george
c.
grant
same
side,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
grant
now,
your
honor
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
our
allegation
is
that
they
put
in
there
intending
to
use
it
knowing
that
we
would
not
be
able
to
properly
present
the
claim
in
new
york
and
that
by
using
the
arbitration
proceeding,
they
would
cut
down
what
we
were
entitled
to.
mr.
george
c.
grant
i
think
that
in
an
arbitration,
as
i
argued
yesterday,
that
we
would
not
be
able
to
properly
present
this
fraud
issue
because
it's
a
complicated
question
of
law
that
ought
to
be
presided
over
by
a
judge
and
the
jury
of
fact-finding
issue
should
--
finding
the
issues
of
fact
should
be
instructed
by
one
learned
in
the
law
as
to
what
law
is
on
this
issue.
and
that
the
arbitrators
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
i
think
the
la
--
in
labor
issue
is
a
place
where
arbitration
works
fine
because
generally,
it's
a
fact
issue,
as
your
honor
pose
it,
as
to
whether
he
was
improperly
discharged
as
the
facts
of
the
things,
but
--
i
think
there
is
such
a
clear
overriding
public
policy
in
the
miller
act
that
a
person
shall
had
the
right
to
sue
and
congress
didn't
stop
there
by
saying
he
had
the
right
to
sue.
they,
i
say,
had
in
mind
the
provisions
it
would
have
authorized
the
stay
if
they
had
not
going
on
and
say
it
and
shall
have
the
right
to
prosecute
said
action
to
final
execution
and
judgment
and
the
right
to
prosecute
means
to
carry
on
and
then
never
stop
until
you
get
a
final
judgment
and
i
say
congress
had
in
mind
that
such
a
suit
for
the
relief
of
people
who
furnished
improvements
for
the
public
works,
furnished
labor
or
materials
that
that
suit
is
here
to
stop,
that
they
ought
to
have
a
ready
remedy
and
access
to
the
courts
to
enforce
it.
mr.
george
c.
grant
after
the
controversy
had
arisen?
mr.
george
c.
grant
well,
i
think
it's
something
he
couldn't
waive,
that's
my
position.
mr.
george
c.
grant
it's
my
position
he
could
not
have
waived
it
in
advance.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
c.
grant
i
think
there
is
a
very
definite
distinction
in
the
law
applicable
as
to
whether
you
can
waive
something
in
advance
or
where
after
your
rights
has
arisen,
you
can
agree
to
waive
certain
rights.
there's
definitely
policy
of
law
as
i
understand
against
waiving
rights
granted
to
you,
where
the
man
blanks,
signed
a
blank
check,
giving
them
away
as
what
this
amounts
to,
but
after
you
have
a
full
realization
of
what
it
is
you've
given
up,
it
is
easier
for
the
court
to
say
that
you
ought
to
be
bound
by
an
agreement
to
give
it
up.
mr.
george
c.
grant
well,
i
--
(voice
overlap)
i
wouldn't
concede
that
it
would
be
enforceable
if
it
were
signed
after
the
dispute
arose,
because
in
the
brooklyn
savings
bank
versus
o'neil
case
where
there
was
no
specific
prohibition.
that's
one
thing
i
want
to
point
out,
unless
it
had
to
be
an
argued
that
in
that
case,
there
was
a
provision
against
waiver,
there
was
not.
that's
the
very
thing
the
court
decided
that
even
the
absence
of
a
prohibition
against
waiver,
there
can
be
no
waiver
of
rights
granted
by
an
act
where
waive
them
would
(voice
overlap).
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes
sir
and
in
that
case,
the
rights
had
arisen,
this
is
what
i'm
getting
at.
at
the
time
the
waiver
was
signed,
the
rights
had
already
arisen.
and
there
was
in
the
act
nothing
prohibiting
a
waiver
and
yet
this
court
said
that
the
congressional
purpose
is
so
clear
that
there
shall
not
be
a
waiver.
we
won't
permit
it
even
though
the
waiver
was
signed
after
the
rights
have
all
approved.
mr.
george
c.
grant
that
is
not
true.
mr.
george
c.
grant
it
comes
down
to
that
your
honor,
that
the
miller
act
has
such
a
clear
policy
to
prosecute
the
action
to
final
execution.
mr.
george
c.
grant
well,
if
i'm
wrong
in
that,
the
only
other
position
i
have
is
that
we
are
not
engaged
in
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
the
arbitration
act.
now
mr.
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
oh,
i
certainly
take
that
position.
i
asked
mr.
justice
black
yesterday
that
i
didn't
waive
that
claim.
it
should
be
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes
and
(voice
overlap)
contract.
mr.
george
c.
grant
that
is
my
position.
mr.
george
c.
grant
we
allege
in
the
complaint
that
the
arbitration
clause
was
inserted
in
the
contract
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
and
part
of
the
one
illegal
spilling.
mr.
george
c.
grant
yes.
now,
with
these
details,
subparagraph
just
set
out
the
manner
in
which
they
carried
into
effect
the
one
scheme
they
had
which
was
to
obtain
money
and
materials
without
paying
both
as
they're
required
to
do.
mr.
george
c.
grant
well,
your
honor,
i'd
say
there's
a
definite
distinction
in
the
facts
there
and
i
was
about
to
try
to
point
out
that
mr.
edenfield
said
yesterday
this
was
additions
to
the
existing
afa's
--
the
record
shows
clearly
on
page
73,
74,
77
and
97
that
this
was
pure
woods
ground.
nothing
there
before
based
on
in
this
construction
and
that
the
nearest
airbase
was
15
miles
away
and
the
intervening
property
was
private
property,
had
no
connection
with,
it
has
no
facility
to
perform
at
this
airbase.
it's
operated
by
the
army
while
the
warner
robins
air
base
as
operated
by
the
air
force.
it's
not
a
part
of
an
existing
thing.
it's
brand
new
construction
and
under
that
theory,
it's
not
something
added
too
and
it
was
different
in
the
case
your
honor
brought.
thank
you.
mr.
george
c.
grant
in
the
miller
act
case
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
well,
i
think
it's
two-pronged
proposition
and
that
i
should
have
point
out
that
this
proceeding
they
brought
in
new
york
was
not
just
notice
of
arbitration.
it's
a
suit
to
compel
arbitration
and
the
statute
disclosed
in
the
record
in
new
york
as
almost
word
per
word
section
4
of
the
united
states
arbitration
act.
they
have
the
joint
--
mr.
george
c.
grant
i
do
definitely
take
that
position,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
grant
and
that's
what
--
well
i
assume
mr.
justice
white
had
reference
to
miller
act
cases
that
they
just
can't,
you
can't
prosecute
it
and
hold
it
stay
and
go
arbitrate
and
comply
with
the
terms
of
miller
act
in
our
position.
thank
you.
