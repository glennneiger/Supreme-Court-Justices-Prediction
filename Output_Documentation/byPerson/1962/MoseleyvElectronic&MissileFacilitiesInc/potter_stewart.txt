justice
potter
stewart
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
it
were
clear
that
you
would
voluntarily
at
arms
length
agreed
to
this
arbitration
provision
and
then
changed
your
mind
later?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
the
federal
government
wouldn't
have
had
any
power
to
act
in
that
area
at
this
point
in
interstate
commerce,
wouldn't
that
be
true?
justice
potter
stewart
generally
speaking,
a
lawsuit
in
the
district
court
would
give
you
prompter
relief
and
arbitration
would?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
what
kind
of
an
arbitration
panel
does
the
agreement
provide
for?
justice
potter
stewart
just
going
back,
going
back
to
your
first
point,
why
couldn't
the
surety
be
a
part
to
the
arbitration
under
the
agreement
that
you
make?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
agreement
provides
that
other
parties
can
be
brought
into
the
arbitration?
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
party
or
the
party
affected
the
surety
i'm
talking
about.
however
if
that's
--
