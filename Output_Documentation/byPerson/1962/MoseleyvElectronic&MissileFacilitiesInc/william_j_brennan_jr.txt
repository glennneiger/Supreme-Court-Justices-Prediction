there's

[inaudible]
were
obtained
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,

there's
never
been
any
decision
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
whole
case
is
turned,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
court
that
was
found
that
was
not
enforced
[inaudible]
contrary
to
the
policy
of
the
miller
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
[inaudible]
disagreed
with
the
district
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
the
court
of
appeals
would
reverse,
there
still
had
to
be
a
trial,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
suppose
it's
sustained,
they
were
still
at
the
trial,
the
allegations
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
allegation
of
overreaching
on
the
part

the
prime
contractor

that
has
never
been
decided.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
[inaudible]
will
not
that
issue
have
to
be
tried
out
in
the
district
court?
justice

j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
that
this
provision
for
trial
in
the
district
court
under
the
miller
act
is
not
waivable.
is
there
anything
in
the
miller
act
in
the
way
of
a
provision
to
comparable
of
those
provisions
that
much?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
attach
any
significance
to
that
on
the
question
whether
this
right
is
waivable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
in
my
--
which
came
first,
the
lawsuit
in
georgia
or
your
arbitration
proceeding
in
new
york?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
was
then
before
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
you
after
that,
after
you
obtained
your
stay,
you
then
filed
a
suit
in
the
new
york
supreme
court,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
what
did
you
do
in
new
york?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
yes,
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
they
were
to
amend
mr.
edenfield,
if
they
would
have
tomorrow
to
amend
in
district
court
in
georgia.
now
i'm
saying
they
want
an
order
of
arbitration.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
in
georgia.
this
sentence
in
section
4,
would
certainly
on
the
face
of
it,
seems
to
indicate
that
that's
the
only
order
of
the
district
court
could
give
because
it
reads
the
hearing
and
proceedings
under
subsequently
shall
be
within
the
district
in
which
the
petition
for
an
order
directing
such
arbitration
is
filed,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
i'm
suggesting
that
if
they
were
to
amend
in
this
--
their
pleadings
in
the
district
court
and
ask
an
order
directing
you
to
arbitrate
under
the
agreement.
wouldn't
the
order
have
to
direct
the
proceedings
an
arbitration
to
be
held
in
the
district
in
georgia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn't
read
it
that
way,
frankly
mr.
edenfield
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
all
that
they
did
in
shanferokee
was
to
say
that
whether
or
not
an
order
of
arbitration
could
be
entered
under
section
4
a
stay
could
be
granted
under
section
3.
