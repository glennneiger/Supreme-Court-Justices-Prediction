mr.
newell
edenfield
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
in
undertaking
to
prepare
myself
for
this
argument,
i
think
i
played
a
little
guessing
game
that
i
am
sure
that
have
done
before
me,
tried
to
guess
what
question
it
was
that
caused
certiorari
to
be
granted
in
this
case.
i
am
still
not
at
all
sure,
so
i
can
only
address
myself
if
the
court
please
to
the
matters
which
have
been
made
by
opposing
counsel
in
their
brief
and
to
such
questions
that
may
have
been
asked
while
he
was
addressing
the
court.
several
things
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
may
it
please
the
court
there
is
one
federal
case
and
i
don't
believe
it
came
from
this
court,
where
that
question
was
raised
as
concerns
the
question
whether
or
not
the
enforcement
would
take
place
in
new
york,
where
the
arbitration
took
place
or
in
a
district
court
where
the
suit
was
filed.
and
it
was
sort
of
equivocal
on
it
but
i
understood
the
holding
to
be
that
in
a
proper
case
notwithstanding
that
they
could
enforce
it
in
whether
--
back
in
macon,
georgia.
mr.
newell
edenfield
i
thought
that
this
would
be
the
proper
way
it
would
be
handled.
that
the
suit
in
the
district
court
which
is
brought
in
the
proper
district
pursuant
to
the
miller
act
would
be
stayed
as
the
arbitration
act
provides
pending
arbitration.
once
arbitration
had
taken
place,
this
--
the
award
will
then
come
back
to
the
district
court
in
macon
to
be
enforced
which
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
alright.
mr.
newell
edenfield
i'll
try
to
ask
comment
but
more.
mr.
newell
edenfield
your
honor,
the
arbitration
division
in
this
contract
has
brought
enough
to
prevent
for
mid
arbitration
anyway.
mr.
newell
edenfield
well
if
it
can
be
arbitrated
anywhere
if
the
court
please,
i
see
no
obstacle
to
be
enforced
in
the
middle
district
of
georgia.
mr.
newell
edenfield
oh,
you
mean
the
entering
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
alright
sir,
i'll
discuss
it
tomorrow.
but
i
may
go
on
to
some
of
the
question
raised
here
this
afternoon.
the
question
was
raised
whether
or
not
the
stand
of
the
fraud
alleged
in
this
contract
and
whether
or
not
there
was
any
over
reaching
of
the
parties
in
certain
arbitration
provision.
the
only
fraud
claimed
in
that
connection
is
that
the
contractor
maliciously
inserted
an
arbitration
provision.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
this
is
under
an
action
for
a
seizure.
i'll
discuss
that,
that
was
one
of
the
question
i
asked
is
what
i
mean
at
this
time.
mr.
justice
black
also
suggested
that
there
might
be
an
impossibility
of
requiring
someone
to
go
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
for
the
purpose
of
arbitration.
that
case
--
that
question
came
up
in
the
second
circuit
if
the
court
please,
in
the
case
of
shanferoke
coal
company
versus
west
chester
service
corporation.
it
was
decided
by
just
judge
learned
hand
that
you
could
require
to
arbitrate
although
it
required
going
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
this
court
had
found
it
unanimously,
if
the
court
please
in
the
decision
by
justice
brandeis.
both
of
those
cases
are
cited
in
our
brief.
now
as
far
as
the
question
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
no,
sir.
but
they
said
somewhere,
your
honor.
mr.
newell
edenfield
under
the
arbitration
act.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes.
mr.
newell
edenfield
there
has,
yes
sir
and
both
of
those
of
course
were
my
maritime
transactions.
mr.
newell
edenfield
the
two
that
i
referred
to
in
the
second
circuit
shanferoke
coal,
s-h-a-n-f-e-r-o-k-e
coal
company
versus
westchester
service
corporation.
mr.
newell
edenfield
it
was.
the
same
case
was
unanimously
affirmed
here
it
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
it's
in
the
brief.
now
let
me
say
this
about
it
in
explanation.
it
was
decided
prior
to
erie
versus
tompkins
and
later
in
bernhardt
versus
polygraphic,
this
court
later
held
that
where
a
diversity
case
was
involved
that
distinguished
from
a
federal
question
that
arbitration
was
so
substantive
that
it
would
have
to
be
governed
by
a
state
law,
but
whether
there
is
a
federal
question
involved,
we
take
the
position
that
shanferoke
is
a
full
based
decision
of
this
court
which
is
still
in
effect.
and
in
the
circuit
court
that
judge
hand
held
that
they
would
require
arbitration
even
though
it
would
require
them
to
go
beyond
the
jurisdiction
on
the
court.
now
as
far
as
whether
the
transaction
here
involved
was
in
commerce,
of
course
the
fifth
circuit
decided
that
in
our
favor
and
decided
the
reasons
for
it
not
only
were
the
parties
here
from
different
states
themselves
these
were
the
improvements,
physical
improvements
to
instrumentalities
which
were
already
in
commerce,
namely
two
air
force
bases.
these
were
addition
to
existing
air
force
bases.
personnel
were
used
and
brought
across
state
lines.
a
subcontractor
came
from
across
state
lines.
material
was
brought
across
state
line
and
in
that
connection,
i
might
say
that
the
instance
in
which
mr.
justice
goldberg
got
after
our
clients
in
another
context,
they
were
doing
precisely
the
same
thing
at
another
air
force
base
and
were
held
to
be
in
commerce.
now
at
that
point,
justice
black
made
some
remarks
about
the
language
of
the
commerce
that
arbitration
act
being
different.
i
might
say
that
it
may
as
different
from
the
fair
labor
standards
act
but
it
is
in
the
language
if
the
court
please
of
the
constitution,
article
1
section
8
clause
3.
mr.
newell
edenfield
involving
transactions
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes.
now
as
to
the
question,
judge
black
raised
about
the
davis-bacon
act,
it
is
incorporated
in
this
contract
at
the
record
at
page
46.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
newell
edenfield
mr.
justice
goldberg,
as
i
understood
to
you
say
the
first
three
word
of
that
section
are,
a
person
agreed
by
a
failure
to
arbitrate,
is
that
the
way
it
begins?
mr.
newell
edenfield
if
that
is
correct
then,
your
honor,
you
see
they
brought
a
suit
against
us
in
district
court,
we
asked
for
a
stay
pending
our
arbitration.
so
we
have
the
matter
before
the
district
court.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
newell
edenfield
i
can
say
this,
if
the
court
please
as
justice
black
has
mentioned
some
of
them
have
been
sent
to
london.
there
are
three
physical
presences
in
circuit
courts
where
miller
act
cases
have
been
sent
elsewhere
to
be
arbitrated.
and
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
no,
sir.
i
have
to
admit
there
is
not.
mr.
newell
edenfield
pending
arbitration,
yes
sir.
mr.
newell
edenfield
you
mean
to
compel
and
to
arbitrate?
no,
sir
that
kind
hadn't
refused
to
arbitrate.
mr.
newell
edenfield
no,
sir.
mr.
newell
edenfield
we
got
into
court
before
we
could.
they
have
never
been
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes.
now
let
me
say
this,
mr.
justice
black,
what
we
did
up
there
for
going
back
to
paragraph
four
or
second
quote,
we
were
not
at
that
time
aggrieved
by
a
failure
to
arbitrate
so
as
to
require
us
to
go
into
the
district
court.
there
had
been
no
refusal
to
arbitrate.
the
dispute
came
up
and
at
then
though
refuse
to
arbitrate,
we
sought
to
bring
--
to
start
arbitration,
not
knowing
whether
there
was
going
to
be
a
dispute
or
whether
we
will
be
going
to
be
aggrieved
or
not.
mr.
newell
edenfield
that's
correct,
sir.
the
next
thing
we
know,
we
went
to
district
court
in
the
middle
district
of
georgia.
mr.
newell
edenfield
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
yesterday,
mr.
justice
black
asked
that
i
respond
this
morning
to
the
question
whether
section
4
of
the
united
states
arbitration
act
relating
to
the
enforcement
of
arbitration
where
there
had
been
a
refusal
to
arbitrate
does
not
prevent
the
type
of
arbitration
here
attempted,
and
specifically,
whether
section
4
does
not
prevent
arbitration
in
georgia
or
order
of
arbitration
in
georgia
to
take
place
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
newell
edenfield
justice
brennan,
we
gave
notice
of
arbitration
pursuant
to
the
agreement
in
new
york.
mr.
newell
edenfield
thereupon
suit
was
filed
by
the
subcontractor
in
georgia.
thereupon
we
sought
a
stay
in
georgia
pending
arbitration
in
new
york.
those
were
the
order
of
events.
mr.
newell
edenfield
no
sir,
we
did
not
obtain
a
stay.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
district
judge
enjoined
us
from
proceeding
in
new
york
and
we
went
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
reversed.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
we
had
had
served
notice
pursuant
to
the
new
york
civil
practice
act
and
it
had
been
set
down
there.
i'm
not
sure
whether
you
call
that
filing
a
suit
or
not,
i'm
not
familiar
with
new
york
arbitration,
but
we
had
set
it
in
motion
and
a
hearing
had
been
set,
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed
by
the
subcontractor
in
georgia
whereupon
we
were
enjoined
from
proceeding
in
new
york
until
that
was
reversed
by
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
newell
edenfield
we've
done
nothing
because
we're
still
under
injunction.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
no
sir
the
matter
is
in
status
quo
until
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
i
had
not
thought
on
yesterday
that
section
4
that
any
problem
was
presented
under
section
4
because
i
was
on
the
opinion
that
we
had
not
yet
gotten
to
section
4.
we're
still
trying
to
get
a
stay
under
section
3
and
i
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
two
sections
were
rather
unrelated.
mr.
newell
edenfield
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
some
authority
on
that
which
i'd
like
to
present
consisting
of
a
shanferokee
case
which
i
mentioned
yesterday.
i
think
that
is
the
only
case
where
this
court
in
a
full
bench
decision
has
ever
discussed
the
relationship
between
sections
3
and
section
4
of
the
arbitration
act
and
i
believe
that
decision
puts
the
question
at
rest.
now,
the
shanferokee
case
is
cited
in
our
brief
but
it
was
not
cited
on
this
point
because
the
conflict
or
possible
conflict
between
3
and
4
was
not
mentioned
or
had
not
been
raised
until
yesterday.
for
that
reason,
i
would
like
to
discuss
it
just
a
minute
and
to
read
what
the
court
said,
what
this
court
says
as
to
relationship
between
sections
3
and
section
4
of
the
arbitration
act.
now
shanferokee,
if
the
court
please,
involved
an
interstate
sale
of
coal.
the
defendant
was
sued
by
the
plaintiff
and
upon
being
sued,
he
sought
to
pend
--
to
stay
the
action
pending
arbitration.
now
as
to
what
happened
in
the
court
below,
this
court
said
and
i'm
reading
from
293
u.s.,
page
451,
this
is
mere
recital
of
what
happened
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
interpreted
the
clause
that
is
the
arbitration
clause
as
making
the
arbitration
enforceable
only
in
the
state
courts
of
new
york
and
on
that
ground
denied
the
stay.
on
appeal
from
the
order
of
denial,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
even
if
the
clause
should
be
so
interpreted,
section
3
of
the
united
states
arbitration
act
authorized
the
stay.
it,
therefore,
reversed
the
order
and
direct
to
the
district
court
to
grant
the
stay
and
would
leave
and
so
forth
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
so
we
had
a
situation
there
where
there
was
an
application
for
a
stay
under
section
3,
the
court
felt
like
that
section
4
would
go
to
be
enforced
in
new
york
that
it
couldn't
grant.
now,
in
dealing
with
relation
with
that
question
and
relationship
between
sections
3
relating
to
stay
and
section
4
relating
to
enforcement,
this
court
says,
“the
plaintiff
contends
that
the
district
court
was
without
power
to
grant
the
stay
because
the
contract
provides
that
arbitration
can
be
compelled
only
by
proceedings
in
a
state
court
of
new
york.”
the
provision
here
is
that,
“either
party
may
apply
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
for
an
order
compelling
specific
performance
of
this
arbitration
agreement
in
accordance
with
the
arbitration
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.”
the
contract
does
not
in
terms
prohibit
proceedings
in
the
federal
court
whether
it
should
be
construed
so
as
to
exclude
the
bringing
of
a
suit
in
the
federal
court
to
compel
specific
performance
of
the
agreement
arbitrary.
we
have
no
occasion
to
decide
for
the
district
court
was
not
asked
this
in
the
proceeding
now
under
review
to
compel
specific
performance.
the
motion
was
to
stay
the
action
until
arbitration
shall
have
been
had
and
the
direction
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
limited
to
granting
a
stay.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
we've
come
to
what
this
--
this
court
said
about
relationship
between
sections
3
and
4.
section
3
of
the
united
states
arbitration
act
provides
the
broadly
that
the
court
may,
“stay
the
trial
of
the
action
until
such
arbitration
had
been
had
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
agreement.”
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
clearly
right
in
concluding
that
there
is
no
reason
to
imply
that
power
to
grant
a
stay
is
conditioned
upon
the
existence
of
power
to
compel
arbitration
in
accordance
with
section
4
of
the
act.
marine
transit
versus
dreyfus
if
not
to
the
contrary,
there
is
on
the
other
hand
strong
reason
for
construing
the
clause
as
permitting
the
federal
court
to
order
a
stay
even
when
it
cannot
compel
the
arbitration.
but
otherwise,
despite
congressional
approval
of
arbitration,
it
would
be
impossible
to
secure
a
stay
of
an
action
in
the
federal
courts
when
the
arbitration
agreement
provides
for
compulsory
proceedings
exclusively
in
the
state
court.
so
it
seems
to
me,
like
what
the
court
is
saying,
if
the
court
please,
is
that
under
section
3,
you
can
grant
a
stay
which
is
what
is
here
involved.
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
the
court
would
have
jurisdiction
to
enforce
under
section
4,
and
incidentally
in
the
circuit
court,
judge
learned
hand
in
the
same
case
before
it
got
here,
made
this
remark
which
was
confirmed
by
what
i've
just
read
and
this
appears
from
page
297
of
70
f.2d.
we
see
no
reason
for
a
limited
construction,
that
is
of
the
united
states
arbitration
act,
and
conclude
that
section
3
authorizes
a
stay
even
though
the
arbitration
must
take
place
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
a
right
to
a
stay
under
section
3
is
unrelated
to
and
fully
independent
of
section
4.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
newell
edenfield
no
sir.
no
sir,
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
newell
edenfield
mr.
justice
goldberg,
my
view
of
that
is
that
there
is
no
inconsistency
here.
the
suit
here
involved
is
actually
pending
in
the
district
which
the
miller
act
prescribes.
mr.
newell
edenfield
in
georgia.
ultimate
judgment
in
my
opinion
can
be
entered
in
that
court
which
fully
conforms
to
and
complies
with
the
miller
act.
at
the
same
time,
it
reconciles
and
conforms
to
shanferokee
code.
my
idea
about
the
way
the
two
would
be
reconciled
is
this;
the
suit
is
brought
as
the
miller
act
provides
it
shall
be
brought
in
a
district
where
part
of
the
work
is
to
be
performed.
the
agreement
provides
for
arbitration
in
new
york.
shanferokee
says
that's
perfectly
alright.
consequently,
you
stay
the
proceedings
in
the
middle
district
of
georgia.
just
as
they
did
in
shanferokee,
you
send
it
to
new
york
to
be
arbitrated.
when
this
has
been
arbitrated
in
new
york,
you'd
come
back
in
the
state
of
georgia
and
enter
final
judgment,
and
you
reconcile
everything.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
and
that's
the
entire
purpose
of
the
united
states
arbitration
act.
mr.
newell
edenfield
no
sir.
mr.
newell
edenfield
well,
justice
goldberg
isn't
that
true
of
all
the
arbitrations?
mr.
newell
edenfield
and
there's
a
policy
in
favor
of
it
and
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
mr.
goldberg
i
believe
--
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
believe,
we
may
have
not
change
the
fact
just
a
slight
bit.
it
has
been
held
in
the
lower
courts
albeit
that
in
miller
act
proceeding
you
can
waive
venue.
mr.
newell
edenfield
no
sir.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
in
one
instance
for
example,
they
held
it
was
automatically
waived
because
the
work
was
to
be
done
in
newfoundland.
and
if
you
had
to
bring
it
in
a
district
where
the
work
was
being
performed
and
there's
no
district
in
newfoundland
obviously,
there
had
to
be
some
other
district
in
which
it
could
be
brought.
the
main
opinion
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
incidentally
cites
other
instances
and
the
lower
federal
courts,
i'll
admit,
flatly
holding
that
the
venue
provisions
of
the
miller
act
can
be
waived.
not
a
word
is
there
said
in
the
miller
act
prohibiting
arbitration
then
you
can
be
waived
and
incidentally,
that
is
the
next
point
which
i
wanted
to
address
myself
is
what
is
this
provision
in
the
miller
act?
is
it
simply
a
venue
provision
which
can
be
waived
or
is
it
as
mr.
grant
says
on
any
group
part
of
a
new
federal
right
which
prescribes
not
only
the
right
but
the
remedy
by
which
is
to
be
invoked.
now,
that
is
the
thrust
of
his
argument
and
his
main
argument,
i
may
add.
he
says
and
his
contention
is
relying
on
this
provision
in
the
miller
act
that
suit
shall
be
brought
here
and
not
elsewhere.
and
that
it
may
be
prosecuted
there
to
final
judgment.
and
that
that
is
a
mandate
first
that
you
can't
do
it
anywhere
else,
and
second
that
means
you
cannot
arbitrate.
now
i
agree
with
the
principle
of
law
which
he
cites
that
where
congress
creates
a
new
right
unknown
to
the
common
law
and
as
an
integral
part
of
that
right,
congress
prescribes
a
remedy.
the
right
becomes
--
the
remedy
becomes
a
part
of
the
right
and
the
right
can
only
be
enforced
in
a
manner
prescribed.
mr.
grant
cites
and
i
agree
with
those
cases,
the
case
of
wilko
versus
swan.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
suit
under
--
for
a
violation
of
the
marginal
of
the
provisions
of
the
securities
act.
now
there
was
no
such
suit
in
common
law,
the
securities
act
created
the
suit.
it
not
only
prescribed
a
venue
provision
but
it
provided
for
a
non-waiver
provision.
and
i
think
clearly
having
--
congress
having
provided
a
new
right
and
having
prescribed
the
venue
provision
and
having
gone
further
and
put
in
a
non-waiver
provision,
you
had
to
follow
it
as
this
court
held
in
the
wilko
case
and
exactly
the
same
way
in
the
griffith
saving
bank
case
which
mr.
grant
cites.
that
was
a
fair
labor
standards
act.
there
was
no
such
cause
of
action
as
the
fair
labor
standards
suit
at
common
law.
congress
created
the
right.
in
creating
the
right,
they
made
as
a
part
of
it
as
an
integral
part
of
it
a
venue
statute.
that
also
contained
a
non-waiver
provision.
consequently,
the
remedy
became
a
part
of
the
right
itself
and
had
to
be
enforced
exactly
as
the
statute
provided.
mr.
newell
edenfield
mr.
justice
black,
i'm
confident
to
say
you
anticipate
that's
the
bare
point
i'm
making,
the
miller
act
creates
no
new
right.
mr.
newell
edenfield
i'm
getting
just
a
little
ahead
of
our
set
but
since
you
ask,
i
will
answer
it
the
best
i
can.
that
provision
to
my
mind
is
simply
a
venue
provision
for
a
right
which
has
existed
as
long
as
a
subsidy.
mr.
newell
edenfield
the
reason
for
passing
it,
if
the
court
please,
is
that
it
is
a
hold
over
from
the
old
heard
act.
mr.
newell
edenfield
the
reason
for
passing
the
heard
act
of
course
it
was
to
or
not
to
create
a
new
right
in
favor
of
contractor
because
they
had
that
right
ever
since
they'd
been
[inaudible]
mr.
newell
edenfield
its
purpose
was
to
implement
that
right.
mr.
newell
edenfield
to
make
it
more
secure.
mr.
newell
edenfield
to
make
more
certain
that
they
got
their
money.
mr.
newell
edenfield
that
was
the
whole
purpose
but
i
beg
to
point
this
out
sir,
it
created
no
new
right.
if
this
bond
and
this
contract
had
been
made
part
of
the
miller
act,
there
still
could
have
been
a
suit
on
it.
mr.
newell
edenfield
no.
there
still
could
have
been
a
suit
on
it
by
this
plaintiff,
this
subcontract.
it's
nothing
more
than
a
contract,
neither
the
bond
nor
the
subcontract.
mr.
newell
edenfield
if
it
please
the
court,
isn't
it
true
that
every
venue
statute
guarantee
you
a
right
to
sue
in
a
certain
place.
and
if
you
can
waive
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
your
honor
it
was
not
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes.
it
was
passed
for
that
purpose.
now,
as
to
the
venue
provision,
however
if
the
court
please,
the
legislative
history
does
not
indicate
entirely
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
it.
if
i
may
trace
the
history
of
the
miller,
i
mean
of
the
heard
act
from
which
this
provision
was
derived,
your
honor
will
recall
that
the
heard
act
provided
for
one
suit
for
everybody
to
be
brought
by
the
government
in
which
contractors
and
subcontractors
could
intervene
and
if
there
was
anything
left
after
the
government
got
its
money,
they
could
adjudicate
their
claims
to
final
judgment.
and
since
there
was
to
be
but
one
suit
on
behalf
of
everybody,
of
course,
there
had
to
be
someplace
specified
where
was
it
to
be
brought
and
therefore,
the
heard
act
first
contained
this
language
that
it
should
be
brought
in
a
district
where
part
of
the
work
was
performed
and
that
it
should
be
--
could
--
could
be
prosecuted
to
final
judgment
right.
now,
that
provision
would
have
been
unnecessary
when
the
miller
act
was
passed
because
the
miller
act
came
along
and
instead
of
creating
one
bond
for
everybody
as
the
heard
act
had
done,
it
created
two
bonds;
one
for
the
performance
bond
for
the
government
and
one
of
payment
bond
for
contractors.
so
really,
there
was
no
need,
you
might
say,
to
any
longer
have
this
provision
about
bringing
the
suit
in
that
place
and
for
prosecution
at
the
final
judgment.
mr.
newell
edenfield
no,
sir.
the
congressional
hearing
recite
that
the
bonding
companies
wanted
it
preserved
because,
otherwise,
they
would
be
subject
to
numerous
suits
in
various
districts
which
might
ultimately
exceed
the
amounts
of
their
bond
limits,
and
according
to
the
hearings,
and
the
congressional
hearings,
it
was
the
bondsman,
not
the
contractors,
not
the
subcontractors,
but
the
bondsman
who
asked
that
this
venue
provision
be
kept
in
that.
so,
i
submit
that
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
venue
statute;
that
miller
act
is
just
like
any
other
act;
that
just
like
any
other
venues
section
it
can
be
waived;
and
that
where
the
parties
have
agreed
to
arbitration
as
they
have
in
this
case,
it
has
been
waived.
now
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
to
an
existing
suit.
mr.
newell
edenfield
your
honor,
i
think
this
court
had
recognized
that
distinction
many
times.
i
don't
see
that
there's
anything
wrong
with
waiving
in
advance
if
the
waiver
concerns
a
right
going
out
of
the
contract.
now,
if
it
was
a
right
that
arose
in
some
other
way,
obviously
an
agreement
in
advance
to
waive
venue
in
a
tort
case
might
be
one
thing.
if
it
were
an
action
brought
by
statute,
but
it
--
right
in
this
case
arises
it
out
of
a
contract
which
the
parties
made
with
each
other,
and
that
there's
some
--
certainly
an
area
in
which
they
had
the
right
to
contract.
and
where
the
waiver
is
contained
in
a
contract
giving
rise
to
the
cause
of
action,
i
have
seen
nothing
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
would
indicate
that
it
could
not
be
waived
in
advance.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
or
otherwise
that
could
be
no
arbitration
agreement.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
incidentally,
the
only
arbitration
agreements
that
this
court
had
ever
turned
over
that
i
know
of,
the
only
arbitration
statutes
that
have
ever
overturned,
our
arbitration
statute
which
makes
arbitration
compulsory
that
is
where
they
say,
this
must
be
arbitrated
and
they
legislate
you
out
of
court.
now,
in
state
in
the
kansas
city
packinghouse
case
that
this
court
held
you
couldn't
do
that
and
in
several
cases
following,
but
as
far
as
i
know
and
dealing
with
state
arbitration
act
long
before
the
miller
act
and
the
old
united
states
arbitration
act
came
up,
this
court
have
never
overturned
an
arbitration
act
where
there
was
an
agreement
for
arbitration.
the
only
place
they've
overturned
them
is
where
the
statute
says,
“you
can't
litigate,
you
must
arbitrate.”
mr.
newell
edenfield
your
honor
this
may
sound
--
i've,
i
hope
i'm
not
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
newell
edenfield
your
honor,
i,
i
don't
read
it
that
way.
now,
if
--
if
--
if
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
i
may
be
allowed
to
reply.
mr.
newell
edenfield
no
sir,
i'm
glad
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
i'm
glad
you
brought
it
up,
but
i
think
that
is
clearly
answered
in
shanferokee.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir
and
that's
all
is
before
this
court.
mr.
newell
edenfield
your
honor,
let
me
state
here
and
now
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
your
honor,
as
i
--
that
--
i
may
be
in
error
about
my
memory
of
section
4,
but
as
i
understood
section
4
it
says,
a
party
aggrieved
by
the
refusal
of
the
opposite
party
to
arbitrate.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes.
now,
he's
aggrieved
by
it
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
no,
sir.
it's
the
other
way
around,
we
aggrieved
by
his
refusal,
we're
trying
to
get
on
it.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
newell
edenfield
let
me
say
this,
we
won't
to
object
to
it.
i
don't
interpret
the
act
as
permitting
it
or
shanferokee
as
requiring,
but
if
that's
the
ultimate
outcome
of
it,
your
honor,
we
have
no
objection
to
arbitrate
in
georgia
if
we
can
find
a
way
to
do
it
under
this
act
but
i
don't
read
the
act
or
the
decision
in
that
manner.
mr.
newell
edenfield
justice
black,
i
agree
with
you
and
i
think
that's
what
the
--
not
only
what
the
court
of
appeals
have
in
my
opinion
is
what
is
right.
mr.
newell
edenfield
in
georgia.
mr.
newell
edenfield
you
mean
the
order
of
enforcement
matter?
mr.
newell
edenfield
i
don't
understand
that
it
would,
if
the
court
please,
under
shanferokee.
mr.
newell
edenfield
i
think
that's
permissible.
i
think
that's
what
the
circuit
court
opinion
suggests
and
i
think
that
the
law
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes.
mr.
newell
edenfield
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
it
had.
i
think
the
only
case
dealing
with
3
and
4
is
shanferokee.
but
in
shanferokee,
they
did
order
in
a
federal
court
to
arbitrate
in
state
court.
mr.
newell
edenfield
i'm
reading
from
the
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
overstated
my
position.
let
me
go
back
and
read
what
the
circuit
court
said
again
and
it
didn't
actually
order
that,
but
it
certainly
is
broad
enough
in
scope
to
encompass
it.
we
see
no
reason
for
a
limited
construction
of
the
arbitration
act
and
conclude
that
section
3
authorizes
the
stay
even
though
the
arbitration
must
take
place
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
now,
that
to
my
--
and
that's
what
this
court
affirmed.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
involves
interpretation
for
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
newell
edenfield
mr.
justice
black,
those
435
congressmen
not
only
passed
that
in
1925,
they
reenacted
it
in
1947
verbatim.
mr.
newell
edenfield
mr.
justice,
if
i
may
say
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
if
i
may
say
so
this
argument
of
inconvenience
doesn't
impresses
me,
for
this
reason:
that's
true
every
time
you
have
interstate
commerce.
one
man
lives
in
california
and
the
other
one
is
live
in
maryland.
they've
got
to
litigate
one
place
to
the
other
one,
one
have
to
get
to
cross
the
country.
mr.
newell
edenfield
your
honor,
it
may
be
just
as
inconvenient
for
us
to
go
to
macon.
mr.
newell
edenfield
it
was
a
new
york
contract.
mr.
newell
edenfield
it
was
a
new
york
contract.
mr.
newell
edenfield
the
work
was
performed
in
georgia.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes.
mr.
newell
edenfield
among
others
from
other
state.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
newell
edenfield
of
course,
they'd
most
likely
live
in
georgia,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
newell
edenfield
that
is
not
necessarily
true.
suppose
--
and
they
were
subcontractors
from
other
states,
suppose
a
subcontractor
was
right
across
the
street
in
new
york
from
the
main
contract
then
the
inconvenience
would
be
on
the
other
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
they
probably
would
be
in
new
york
because
the
supervisor
personnel
came
from
new
york.
so
the
record
show
other
subcontractors
came
from
other
states
and
i
would
assume
they
would
be
with
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
well,
let
us
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument,
your
honor,
that
they
come
from
georgia,
but
the
man
signed
a
contract.
he
had
a
lawyer
when
he
signed
it,
so
mr.
grant
said
yesterday,
he
apparently
read
it.
he
apparently
understood
it.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
you
understand,
i
display
many
connection
with
it
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
newell
edenfield
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
i'm
being
forced
to
a
position
that
i
don't
need
to
go
to.
if
--
if
it
be
the
law
that
the
arbitration
must
take
place
in
georgia,
so
be
it.
that's
alright
with
us,
but
i
was
asked
the
question
what
i
thought
about
it
and
i
said
so.
i'm
frankly
willing
to
go
to
georgia
to
arbitrate.
mr.
newell
edenfield
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
appealability
of
the
order,
your
honor.
mr.
newell
edenfield
your
honor,
i
think
you
got
to
the
section.
mr.
newell
edenfield
your
honor
i
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
i
did
not
read
section
4
as
requiring
the
arbitration
in
that
district.
i
thought
that
was
referring
to
a
hearing
about
whether
or
not
there
was
a
valid
arbitration
agreement.
mr.
newell
edenfield
your
honor,
let
me
say
this,
i
think
you
did
move
one
step
further
than
shanferokee
go,
but
i
think
that’s
definitely
inevitable.
i
mean
to
that
extent,
i
agree.
now,
it
says,
if
what
is
says
that
we
don’t
have
to
decide
that
because
you
just
deal
with
a
stay.
but
i
think
it’s
implicit
in
what
they
say
that
when
he
refuses
to
arbitrate
when
after
the
stay,
obviously
they
are
setting
status
quo
forever
and
the
next
move
is
going
to
be
to
enforce
it.
and
my
own
understanding
of
4
is
that
this
move
to
enforce
can
be
made
in
georgia
and
frankly
reading
4
and
shanferokee
together,
i
thought
it
could
be
held
in
new
york
but
if
it
can't,
so
be
it.
mr.
newell
edenfield
sir?
mr.
newell
edenfield
if
the
court
please,
we
have
provided
for
arbitration
in
several
ways
and
the
arbitration
provision
goes
on
and
says,
if
we
can’t
arbitrate
under
new
york
civil
practice
act,
it
should
be
arbitrated
under
the
provision
of
the
american
arbitration
association.
now
admittedly
that
says,
it
shall
be
in
new
york.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes
sir
and
let
me
say
this,
mr.
justice
black.
i
don't
see
how
they
could
let
that
man
to
arbitrate
in
shanferokee
and
cut
me
out
of
it
when
i
have
an
agreement
just
like
his.
i
think
the
way
i
would
construe
would
harmonize
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
we're
aware
of
that
your
honor,
but
these
people
did
agree
in
a
contract
that
they
would
arbitrate
in
new
york
just
--
and
they
did
it
in
shanferokee
and
they
stated
until
they
did
it.
now,
what
happened
thereafter,
we
don't
know.
and
i
would
say
one
thing,
if
the
interpretation
of
mr.
grant
and
i'm
trying
to
get
back
now
to
where
i
was
awhile
ago,
if
the
interpretation
argued
by
mr.
grant
is
sustained,
the
effect
of
it
will
be,
if
the
court
please,
to
imply
the
repeal
to
the
arbitration
act
to
the
extent
of
miller
act
cases.
in
fact,
that
itself
is
what
mr.
grant
argues
in
his
brief.
he
said
that
arbitration
act
was
passed
first,
now
the
miller
act
was
passed
second
with
these
unusual
provisions
about
why
you
bring
a
suit
and
prosecute
under
final
judgment.
and
to
that
extent,
the
arbitration
act,
you
go
then
to
say
to
a
repeal
pro
tanto,
but
in
substance,
he
said
that,
that
takes
the
miller
act
cases
out
of
it.
well,
of
course,
that
argument
in
the
first
place
implied
repeals
are
not
favored.
if
my
theory
is
correct,
they
can
be
harmonized.
and
furthermore,
while
it's
true
that
the
arbitration
act
was
passed
before
the
miller
act,
and
therefore,
there
might
be
an
implied
repeal
by
the
later
act,
the
arbitration
act
was
subsequently
enacted
as
substantive
law
in
1947,
12
years
after
the
passage
of
the
miller
act
and
not
a
syllable
in
it
was
changed.
so,
congress
had
not
only
said
that
that
was
their
policy
as
far
as
the
arbitration
act
is
concerned,
they've
never
said
there
was
any
exception
in
miller
act
cases,
and
after
the
miller
act,
they
have
repeated
it
in
exactly
the
same
language.
so
that
i
say
that
what
he
is
seeking
to
do,
would
be
to
work
an
implied
repeal
and
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
congress
had
reenacted.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
know
what
my
time
is
but
i
want
to
move
on
to
this
business
of
fraud
just
a
minute,
if
i
may,
which
was
argued
by
mr.
grant.
i
am
sure
the
court
would
be
aware,
how
easy
it
would
be
to
destroy
any
policy
of
arbitration.
if
it
could
be
furthered
the
way
in
every
case
by
having
the
unwilling
party
come
forward
and
say
it
was
obtained
by
deceptive
fraud,
however
ground
this
or
however
frivolous.
mr.
newell
edenfield
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
newell
edenfield
it
would
be
a
defense
to
the
merit
--
yes,
sir,
but
not
to
arbitration.
mr.
newell
edenfield
if
--
of
course,
it
would
to
that
--
in
that
way,
your
honor,
but
i'm
saying
that
just
the
allegation
of
fraud
would
not
prevent
arbitration.
now,
let's
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
well,
now
either
this
question
so
far
as
i
know
had
not
been
discussed
by
this
court.
but
there
was
a
very
interesting
case,
devonshire
fabrics
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
where
that
question
did
come
up
and
was
considered
by
judge
medina
in
new
york
and
incidentally,
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
as
our
judge,
the
case
must
have
been
settled
because
it
never,
i
mean,
it
was
declared
moot
or
something
or
so.
but
in
any
rate,
in
that
case,
judge
medina
flatly
holds
that
in
order
to
--
for
fraud
to
prevent
arbitration,
the
arbitration
provision
must
itself
have
been
obtained
by
fraud.
now,
in
this
case,
the
only
allegation
of
fraud
in
the
whole
petition,
as
far
as
that's
concerned,
is
something
that
was
written
into
the
contract
and
which
he
presumably
read
before
he
signed.
and
the
only
allegation
which
concerns
in
any
manner
whether
the
arbitration
agreement
excerpt
was
procured
by
fraud
was
a
statement
that
it
was
maliciously
inserted
in
the
contract.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
that's
what
it
said.
now,
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
your
honor,
that
i
could
write
something
in
a
contract
and
by
putting
it
in
there
so
the
man
can
read
it,
defraud
him
is
a
little
bit
part
of
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
--
just
because
he
puts
something
in
there
that
was
a
fraud.
mr.
newell
edenfield
may
it
please
court,
i
understand
the
justice's
position
but
let
me
--
i
don't
agree
with
that
that
that's
what
devonshire
hold.
mr.
newell
edenfield
i
don't
–
i
don't
agree
that
that's
the
law
of
this
case
on
this
allegation
but
may
i
proceed
to
another
reason
why
that
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
i
am
saying
that
the
allegations
are
not
sufficient
and
i
am
further
saying
that
even
if
they
were
sufficient
to
draw
it
into
fraud,
he
waived
them
by
continuing
to
perform
after
he
found
out
what
was
going
on.
mr.
newell
edenfield
it
is
the
law
of
as
far
as
i
know
of
every
jurisdiction
that
where
a
man
has
a
contract
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
i
have
some
doubt
about
it.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
it
probably
would
but
that's
the
law
of
georgia.
mr.
newell
edenfield
your
honor,
we
have
cited
some
in
our
brief
but
that
the
law
as
i
understand
it
is
that
if
a
man
claims
that
a
contract
is
shot
through
with
the
fraud
and
he
wants
to
resend
it
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
--
as
soon
as
he
learned
of
the
fraud,
he
must
stop.
he
has
an
election
of
remedies,
whether
to
treat
the
contract
as
continuing
or
whether
to
stop
and
claim
fraud.
now,
by
his
own
allegation,
he
went
ahead
and
completely
performed
he
says,
“everyone
of
these
things
and
the
allegations
of
fraud
he
makes
where
allegations
involving
things
that
he
must
have
known
about
before
he
completed,
and
some
of
them
from
the
very
inception
of
the
contact.”
i
say
and
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
really
get
in
to
that
if
the
court
please,
but
i
simply
say
that
the
court
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes.
yes
sir,
i
believe
it
did,
but
the
circuit
court
as
i
recall
it
did
not
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
the
circuit
judge
tuttle,
yes
sir.
mr.
newell
edenfield
so
does
judge
tuttle
of
the
circuit.
mr.
newell
edenfield
he
mentioned
it
but
i
--
i
declare.
mr.
newell
edenfield
that
wasn't
a
controlling
issue
in
the
case
to
judge
tuttle.
i
say
to
the
court
in
all
sincerity
that
i
believe
upon
and
in
spite
of
the
liberal
rules
of
civil
procedures
that
a
reading
of
these
allegations
of
fraud
will,
to
my
mind,
demonstrate
that
they
border
on
being
frivolous.
i
also
say
that
he
waived
any
claim
of
fraud,
when
he
continued
with
the
job
after
he
knew
of
its
existence.
and
that's
quite
apart
from
the
contingence
in
devonshire
that
he
must
have
alleged
that
that
was
induced
by
fraud
and
i
think
to
my
mind
that
means
more
than
saying
somebody
fraudulently
inserted
it
even
for
the
purposes
of
defraud.
thank
you.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
newell
edenfield
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
read
devonshire,
they
would
try
to
claim
a
fraud
there.
mr.
newell
edenfield
then
i
think
there
would
be
an
award
accordingly.
mr.
newell
edenfield
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that
is
the
gist
as
i
understand
the
devonshire
your
honor.
now,
this
court
has
never
passed
on
that
question
your
honor
posed.
i
think
any
other
rule,
if
the
court
please,
would
allow
an
unwilling
party
to
destroy
any
arbitration
agreement
anywhere
at
anytime
by
simply
alleging
fraud
whether
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes
sir
but
before
--
when
he
proves
this
before
the
jury
and
the
arbitration
is
gone.
mr.
newell
edenfield
well
that
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
then
--
then
i'm
in
fine
shape,
your
honor
because
that's
what
i
say
this
man
hadn't
done.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes,
sir.
and
i
say
repeat
if
that
were
not
true
--
mr.
newell
edenfield
in
the
procurement
thereof.
mr.
newell
edenfield
i
think
that's
my
impression
if
the
court
please,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
however
that
may
be
if
the
court
--
if
this
court
is
to
permit
a
defendant
to
simply
come
in
and
allege
fraud
and
thereby
go
to
a
jury
and
destroy
arbitration.
mr.
newell
edenfield
yes
sir,
i
judge
that's
the
effect
of
it
because
it
relies
upon
devonshire
and
cites
it.
