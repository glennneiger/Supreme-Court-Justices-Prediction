justice
hugo
l.
black
in
new
york?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
you
are
not
inadvertently
waving
an
argument
to
the
effect
that
you
are
going
to
--
if
you
are
forced
to
have
an
arbitration,
you
would
rather
have
it
in
georgia
and
if
the
--
if
the
statute
was
revered
to
arbitration,
so
provide
you're
not
waving
your
right
to
have
it
tried
in
georgia
rather
in
new
york,
are
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
several,
but
there
are
certain
provisions
in
the
arbitration
act
about
where
the
arbitration
shall
be
heard.
justice
hugo
l.
black
while
you
go
to
new
york?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
what
you
would
have
to
do
if
you
obey
the
court's
order
here,
go
to
new
york
to
arbitrate
a
claim
that
arose
in
georgia
while
all
other
witnesses
are
in
georgia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
primary
argument
is
that
the
miller
act
bars
your
--
them
from
forcing
you
to
--
you're
agreeing
to
arbitrate
this
claim
anyway?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
primary
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
your
basic
argument
is
the
only
that
you
do
not
want
to
arbitrate
there,
you
think
the
miller
act
prevention,
you
do
not
want
to
arbitrate
anyway
where
the
act
doesn't
require
--
the
arbitration
act
doesn't
require
it.
i
asked
you
that
because
according
to
some
of
the
courts
who
have
passed
on
this
matter,
you
cannot
be
compelled
to
go
outside
your
state
to
arbitrate
a
claim
of
this
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
precisely
what
did
you
say
the
man
that
contracted
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
say
your
client
had
contracted
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
at
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
construction
of
a
housing
plant
in
georgia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
housing
equipment
in
georgia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
your
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
part
of
it
carried
on
in
the
interstate
commerce?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
the
statute,
you
have
raised
a
question
also
about
whether
or
not
this
was
in
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
the
arbitration
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
was
that
decided
against
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
necessary
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
in
the
arbitration
act
that
defines
in
commerce
is
in
some
statute
that
matters
which
affect
interstate
commerce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
the
ground
you're
arguing
on
that
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
arguing
that
the
arbitration
--
that
this
is
not
subject
to
the
arbitration
act
because
you're
purely
local
plumbing
contractor
was
not
in
commerce
between
the
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
raised
from
the
beginning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that,
but
you're
arguing
both?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
under
the
court,
bacon-davis
act,
the
contract
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
under
the
law
which
provides
that
whether
a
thing
is
local
or
interstate,
a
contractor
making
a
contract
to
the
united
states
must
observe
certain
rules?
is
that
the
law
that's
on
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
whatever
that
was,
the
fair
laborer
standards
act
sets
up
one
thing
for
determining
whether
the
thing
is
in
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
that
act
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
arbitration
act
sets
up
another?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
have
the
ramifications
to
put
an
act,
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
the
full
sweep
of
the
freeport
doctrine.
that
a
--
it
--
it's
enough
for
congress
to
take
jurisdiction
under
the
statute
to
say
that
it
affects
commerce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
does
not
go
that
far,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
is
not
a
maritime
transaction,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
you
have
alleged
in
this
charge
you
make
that
they
do
not
have
any
people
to
do
this
at
work
that
they
contract
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
does
the
court
of
appeals
do
with
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
the
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
such
a
provision
in
the
wage
and
hour
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
held?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
you
argument
on
this
point
that
this
in
short,
and
i
want
to
see
if
i
understand
it,
that
the
miller
act
was
passed
in
order
to
solicitude,
to
take
care
of
the
people
who
supplied
work
and
material
in
construction
work
and
things
of
that
kind
that
it
expressly
gave
them
the
right
to
file
a
suit
in
the
courts
of
law
and
that
if
you
apply
the
arbitration
act
so
as
to
defy
them
of
that
right
to
file
a
suit
as
far
away
at
least
at
the
city
of
new
york
and
south
georgia
that
it
will
impose
various
on
the,
on
the
right
that
congress
intended
to
give
the
workers
and
the
contractors
by
the
miller
act?
is
that
the
argument
you're
making?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
miller
act,
wasn't
it,
was
to
make
it
easy
to
employees
with
work
contracted
with
them
by
contract
easily
going
to
court
and
enforce
their
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
that
thing
that
they
have
to
go
to
new
york
or
to
london
and
arbitrations
are
required
would
put
pretty
big
burden
on
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
prior
of
the
trial
at
the
place
where
the
thing
incurred.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
say
this
that
in
order
to
â€“
we
will
probably
not
finish
this
afternoon
and
before
you
have
finished,
i'd
like
you
to
consider
a
question
of
jurisdiction
raised
by
section
4
of
the
arbitration
act,
which
as
i
read
it,
gives
no
court
jurisdiction
to
import
arbitration
except
in
the
district
that
a
suit
can
be
filed
and
where
the
arbitration
has
to
take
place.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
was,
i
was
referring
not
to
any
case
but
to
the
section
itself
which
i
may
say
at
this
time
as
i
read
it
would
limit
the
right
to
enforce
an
arbitration
agreement
in
georgia
to
the
district
in
which
the
suit
could
be
filed
in
the
district
court
and
it
could
only
enforce
an
arbitration
in
that
district
and
not
in
new
york
by
any
part
for
arbitration.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
the
one
to
call
your
attention
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
if
you
decide
to
discuss
it,
you'd
have
ample
opportunity
to
do
so
because
to
me
it
is
important
jurisdictional
point
in
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
that
is
not
my
question.
my
question
is
whether
or
not
section
4
provides
where
the
suit
can
be
filed
to
enforce
the
arbitration
by
the
only
place
that
can
be
enforced
and
gives
that
court
jurisdiction
only
to
require
arbitration
within
that
judicial
district.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
about
the
contract.
i'm
talking
about
the
statute,
section
4
of
the
arbitration
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that,
that
--
you
still
do
not
get
the
question
i
pose
which
is,
i'd
like
you
to
have
so
you
could
discuss
it
in
the
morning.
as
i
read
the
arbitration
act,
you
cannot
make
a
valid
contract
to
arbitrate
under
it
which
will
be
enforceable
in
a
court,
except
in
the
district
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
and
it
has
to
take
place
and
that
is
the
arbitration.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
to
go
to
london,
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it's
been
quite
a
dispute
over
among
the
courts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
involving
commerce?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
it
says
involving
commerce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
the
new
york
order,
i
mean
the
court
of
appeals
fifth
circuit
has
ordered
them
to
go
to
new
york
pursuant
to
a
suit
you
have
up
there
to
arbitrate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
filed
a
lawsuit
in
new
york
against
the
people
in
georgia
in
that
service
by
constructing
note?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
cannot
get
a
stay
under
section
3
if
your
arbitration
is
unenforceable
under
section
4?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
suppose
the
miller
act
was
repealed
today,
could
this
man
bring
a
suit
under
--
on
a
bond
which
is
not
required
by
law
bona
fide
--
invoking
the
name
of
the
united
states
to
file
the
suit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
that,
that's
why
i'm
saying
what
--
what
does
it
do
when
it
allows
a
suit
to
be
filed
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
and
provides
that
it
should
be
tried
at
one
place
and
nowhere
else?
what
does
it
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
reason
for
passing
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
was
the
reason
for
passing
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
was
its
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
make
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
whole
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
he
--
would
he
have
been
guaranteed
a
right
to
sue
at
the
place
where
the
work
was
done
or
would
he
have
been
compelled
to
go
where
he
could
get
service
somewhere
on
the
other
man?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
let's
talk
about
this
venue
statute
in
this
act,
what
was
it
passed
for,
except
to
protect
the
workers
and
the
materialmen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
give
a
greater
security
and
the
government
to
get
its
money.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
congress
has
left
to
that
without
it
meaning
anything?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
what
the
court
required
you
to
do,
the
court
of
appeals.
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
if
you
follow
it,
requires
that
this
arbitration
take
place
in
new
york,
orders
these
people
to
stop
and
pay,
the
district
court
sustained,
they've
got
to
go
to
new
york
and
arbitrate
under
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
haven't
they?
i
may
have
misread
it,
but
that's
the
way
i
read
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that,
but
that
certainly
what
it
has.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
this
--
you're
asking
for
an
interpretation
of
the
arbitration
act
in
this,
are
you
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you're
saying
we
would
have
to
hold
the
congress,
hold
that
435
members
of
congress
on
the
different
states
in
the
union
and
the
senate
passed
a
bill
intending
that
the
man
in
the
south
georgia
could
waive
his
right,
to
have
his
case
tried
under
the
miller
act
in
south
georgia
but
must
go
all
the
way
to
new
york
or
to
london
as
you
said
where
some
of
the
cases
available
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
to
switzerland,
i
think
of
them
went
to
switzerland
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
that
congress
passed
an
act
which
we
must
construe
to
meaning
that
under
arbitration
act,
a
man
in
south
georgia
can
waive
his
right
so
that
he
has
to
go
all
the
way
to
switzerland,
or
new
york
city
and
hire
lawyers
of
new
york
who
are
familiar
with
new
york
proceeding,
the
new
york
law
in
order
to
try
his
case
as
a
subcontractor
from
south
georgia.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
anybody
say
at
that
time
or
can
you
find
anything
in
the
record
that
indicates
they
were
saying
if
that
constituent
far
removed
from
new
york
city
will
make
a
subcontract,
would
have
to
go
all
the
way
to
new
york
city
and
try
cases
in
a
--
on
a
foreign
language
to
them
so
far
as
arbitration
is
concerned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
be
good
for
new
york
lawyers
but
i
have
an
idea
all
of
them
when
i
understood
it
merely
have
a
new
york
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
court
and
the
congress,
they
are
moving
further
and
further
towards
the
idea
doing
a
way
with
inconvenient
forum,
then
their
cases
be
tried
where
they
can't
have
a
right,
and
where
the
part
is
up
there
with
their
witnesses.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
where
did
this
transaction
take
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
mean
this
bad
rule
they
say
didn't
have
any
people
to
do
it
work.
you
got
a
contract
in
new
york
and
made
a
contract
which
he
said
was
to
be
governed
by
the
laws
of
new
york,
but
where
was
the
work
performed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
a
georgia
contractor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
a
georgia,
cumming
contractor.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
why
would
the
witnesses
for
the
transaction
has
appeared
down
there
most
likely
live?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
would
have
(voice
overlap)
their
deposition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
would
the
witnesses
still
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
issue
is
raised
by
this
man
[inaudible]
for
evidence
of
fraud
to
the
other.
allege
that
while
he
was
there,
certain
things
took
place
and
didn't
pay
him
and
so
forth,
where
would
those
witnesses
most
likely
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
formally
a
contract
prevalent
in
various
parts
of
the
country
by
which
people
who
borrowed
$10
or
$
40
or
a
$100
from
a
loan
man
on
high
rates
of
interest
would
agree
to
the
lender
to
accept
service
for
the
immanent
court
where
they
will
not
present,
confess
judgment
both
for
the
interest
in
appeal
and
as
i
recall
it
some
of
those
contracts
have
been
held
not
to
be
good.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
would
that
settle
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
settle
it?
they
allege
that
your
contract
to
arbitrate
is
no
good
under
the
arbitration
act
for
one
reason
because
you
have
provided
for
an
arbitration
at
a
place
where
the
act
forbids
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
in
new
york
and
nowhere
else,
isn't
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
not
do
your
irreparable
damages.
the
court
is
still
open
in
georgia,
including
the
federal
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
the
defense,
however,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
a
defense
to
this
arbitration
agreement
if
you
can
prove
that
it
was
abuse
of
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
an
allegation
but
maybe
if
an
allegation
of
fraud
was
made
and
they
were
denied
the
right
to
prove
it,
that
would
change
the
situation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
didn't
he
say
as
a
part
of
the
scheme
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
fraud
to
subcontractors
and
that
this
was
to
be
a
device
used
in
order
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
he
could
prove
that,
is
it
your
argument
that
that
wouldn't
be
a
defense
to
the
arbitration
â€“
wouldn't
able
him
to
say,
i
don't
have
to
arbitrate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
books
are
filled
with
cases
that
people
have
been
defrauded
by
written
contracts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
but
that's
not
what
he
alleges.
he
alleges
that
he
put
it
in
there
as
a
part
of
a
scheme
and
plan
to
defeat
his
rights
and
to
defeat
other
subcontractors'
rights
and
that
the
device
he
was
using
was
to
--
and
use
them
to
sign
this
arbitration
agreement
provision.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
what
devonshire
hold.
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
all
i'm
talking
about,
are
you
saying
that
the
allegations
are
not
sufficient
or
that
it
is
not
a
defense
to
an
arbitration
agreement
to
show
that
was
induced
by
fraud?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
law
of
georgia
by
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
could
be
governed
by
the
law
of
georgia,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
far
as
the
fraud
is
concerned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
so
sure
of
that
from
the
cases
i
read
on
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
he
claims?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
the
court
of
appeals
went
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
district
court
held
that
was
sufficient,
didn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
had
georgia
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
the
district
judge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
judge
tuttle
you
say
did
not
go
into
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
saying
that
what's
been
held
many
times,
i
think,
is
a
different
between
a
general
contract
made
long
before
any
controversy
arises
to
waive
your
right
to
go
into
court,
and
an
agreement
after
dispute
is
arisen,
and
that
the
dispute
as
to
how
much
is
owed
--
or
whether
they
could
go
in,
you're
saying
there's
a
difference
between
those
and
you
are
saying
that
under
the
miller
act,
they're
entitled
to
have
that
trial
although
you
wouldn't
say
i
assume
that
if
it
had
a
controversy
and
been
argued
over
and
they
then
agree
to
submit
it
to
arbitration
that
particular
thing
couldn't
be
arbitrated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
going
there
out
on
the
basis
that
the
act
prevents
it
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
or
afterwards?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
had
that
same
question
of
very
much
the
same
of
fela
case
in
duncan
against
thompson
where
the
act
was
construed
as
not
allowing
the
man
to
sign
the
paper
that
would
give
up
his
rights
even
after
the
accident
had
occurred.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
also
insisted
that
you
have
alleged
fraud.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
they
have
refused
to
let
you
offer
evidence
to
show
they
were
guilty
of
fraud.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
miller
act
cases.
