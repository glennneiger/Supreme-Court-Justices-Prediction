douglas
i
don't
think

ever
resurrected
a

a
previous

has
struck

as
being
unconstitutional.

provision
involved.

had
been
arrested

for
making
a
speech
and
have
been
convicted
by
the
maryland
courts
and
have
been
sustained
by
the
court
of

he
clearly
know

you
mean
just
in
the
first

a
misdemeanor
has
been
committed--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the

“i
would
like
someone
to
be
arrested.”
