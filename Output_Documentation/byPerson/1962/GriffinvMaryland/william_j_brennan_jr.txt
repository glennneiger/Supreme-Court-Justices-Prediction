justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
saying
he
would
not
have
done
--
or
he
would
have
done
exactly
what
he
did
do
even
if
he
had
not
been
commissioned
as
deputy
sheriff?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
someone
who
looked
at
his
badge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
don't
think
that
it
alters
the
picture
because
the
final
result
is
the
same.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rauh,
are
you
going
to
suggest
any
view
of
the
solicitor
general's
approach
to
this
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
going
to
suggest
any
view
on
your
part
of
the
solicitor
general's
approach
to
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
a
right
under
maryland
law
that
you
have
to
carry
the
badge,
the
sheriff
badge,
to
make
this
arrest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
didn't--
the
state
didn't
create
the
covenant.
the
parties
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
supposing
the
glen
echo
owner
then
so
prosodically
said
“i'm
going
to
exclude
all
people
with
red
hair.”
would
he
have
the
constitutional
right
to
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
pardon
me.
i
thought
you
suggested
earlier
this
arrest
was
not
authorized
except
by
virtue
of
his
being
a
deputy
sheriff,
collins
with
the
state
power
to
arrest.
