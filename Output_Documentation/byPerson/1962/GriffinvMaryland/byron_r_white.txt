well,
now,
even
under
your
second
argument,
you
didn't
suggest
that
the
property
owner
couldn't
put
people
off
the
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
he
fre--
someone
a--
then,
you
are
suggesting
that
other
people
have
the
right
and
privilege
of
entering
the
property
and,
if
they're
prevented
from
doing
it,
then
they
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
property
owner.
justice
byron
r.

mr.
murphy,
you
said
also
that
the
reason
the
man
was
deputized
was
to
give
him
some
police
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
powers--
what
powers
did
they
want
the
man
to
have
as
a--
as
a
deputy
that
the
owner
didn't
have
himself?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say,
the
owner
could've
arrested
in
any
event.
so,
what
powers
did
they
want
the
man
to
have
that
the
owner
wouldn't
have
had?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
assume
then
from
what
you
say
that
there
was
something
that
they
wanted
him
to
deputize
for.
you
have,
on
the
property,
some
man
with
some
powers
that
the
owner
wouldn't
have
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
probably.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
state
was
willing
to
put
that
sort
of
a
person
on
the
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
fact
remains
that
he
was
deputized.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
he
wa--
and,
if
a
police
officer
has
some
powers
that
an
owner
wouldn't
have
himself,
he
had
it.
he
has
those
powers.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
had
them
by
virtue
of
the
state
having
deputized
him?
