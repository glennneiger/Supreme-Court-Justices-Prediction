justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question
which
i'd
like
to
discuss
as
you
go
along.
would
that
conduct
have
violated
section
1
of
the
civil
rights
act
which
this
court
held
unconstitutional
in
1883?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
challenged
it?
have
you
challenged
the
holding
of
the
court
on
the
civil
rights
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
challenged
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
be,
might
it
not,
from
some
view?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
we
did
do
that,
didn't
we,
with
reference
to
one
in
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
restaurant
case,
i
don't
remember
exactly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
argument
was
that
it
had
passed
into
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
innocuous
death
certificate
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
–
you've
tied
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
i
asked
that
question
precisely
that
way.
i
didn't
intend
to,
i
probably
did,
i
thought
i
had.
you
didn't
finally
have
to
reach
the
question
whether
the
constitution
itself,
standing
alone,
forbids
an
owner
of
a
mercantile
establishment
to
choose
his
customers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
activity
is
not
affected
by
--
doesn't
affect
the
public
interest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that,
under
those
circumstances,
it
is
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
takes
the
public
interest,
i
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
the
warrant
of
arrest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
constitutional
provision
do
you
rest
on
to
draw
that
distinction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
part
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
about
the
church?
what
about
a
church?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
constitution
forbid
the
church--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
choose
who
will
belong
to
it
and
who
it
won't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
by
a
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
extend
it,
however,
to
pri--
to
property
owned
by
people,
either
an
association
or
an
individual.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
reason
i
asked
you
upon
what
specific
constitutional
provision--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
rested
for
those
distinctions.
only,
they
did
not
come
from
the
heavens
but
from
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
suppose
that
the
owner
had
ordered
these
people
off
and
he
had
said
if
--
he
assaulted
them
and
maybe
done
something
pretty
bad.
in
many
cases,
most
of
us
are
familiar
with,
assault
has
been
pretty
serious.
the
defense
has
been
“well,
he
was
on
my
property
and
wouldn't
get
off.”
could
that
maryland
law
be
unconstitutional
in
this
case,
if
the
owner
had
assaulted
him
and
been
tried
for
the
assault
or
could
the
court
have
charged
the
jury,
he
had
a
right
to
use
such
force
as
necessary
even
to
put
him
up--
putting
him
off
by
taking
his
life,
if
necessary
to
protect
his
property?
would
that
be
unconstitutional
under
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
we've
held
that
unconstitutional,
haven't
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
--
but
we've
held
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
were
wrong
about
the--
but
you
were
wrong
about
the
constitutional
distinction
between
the
home
and
place
of
business
or
church
and
so
forth.
you
happen
to
be
wrong
about
that.
what
help
would
a
man
who
had
a
home
have
could
he
get
from
the
government
to
eject
somebody
that
was
in
his
house
he
didn't
want?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
ones?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
constitution--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
constitution
--
wrote
a
law
for
this
country
not
based
on
the
common
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
can't
find
anything
in
the
fourth
amendment,
can
you,
to
support
your
position
you're
taking
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
fourth
amendment
draws
that
distinction,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
protects--
protects
the
home
from
unreasonable
search
and
seizure--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
does
not
protect
the
place
of
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
legal
system--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
courts
have
to
treat
it
according
to
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
constitution,
do
they
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
you
see
no
difference
between
a--
you've
said
several
times,
about
shelley
and
kraemer,
that
this--
i
don't
think
this
point
has
been
discussed.
do
you
see
no
difference
between
allowing
a
man
to
make
a
contract
which,
in
perpetuity,
ties
up
the
property
of
everybody
so
that
those
who
buy
it
and
pay
for
it
cannot
sell
it
and
the
right
of
a
man
to
exercise
ownership
over
his
home
or
his
property
at
an
exact
time
when
he's
claiming
to
a
right
that's
being
invaded?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
was
going
50
years
old.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
the
facts
of
your
argument
has
to
be,
hasn't
it?
and
i'm
not
saying
it's
not
right,
but
your
argument
has
to
be
the
owner
of
a
place
of
business
that
you
would
say,
as
distinguished
from
the
owner
of
a
home
or
the
owner
of
some
other
unknown
things
like
churches
and
things
like
that--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
private
clubs,
you
draw
distinction
and--
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
gets
down
to
this
that
the
constitution
forbids
the
owner
of
this
property
in
this
country
to
exercise
the
power
of
saying
“i
don't
want
certain
people
on
it
because
of
their
color.”
that's
where
it
finally
gets
to,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
basic
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
did
these
two.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
state
action
in
marsh
against
alabama?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
the
state
had
permitted
a
group
there
to
run
the
state
as
part
of
the
common
public
affairs
of
the
state.
that
simply
permitted
it.
had
they
taken
any
direct
positive
action
in
that
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
owners
of
the
property
did
that,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
be
hard
to
find
any--
that
what
you
usually
think
of
is
direct,
own,
frank
public
action
on
the
part
of
the
state,
which
barred
these
individuals
to
admit,
except
the
enforcement--
enforcing
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
total
proscription
by
the
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
going
to
answer
the
argument
to
the
effect
that
your
statute
neither
made
crime
nor
did
you
charge
the
crime
to
be
that
this
person
stayed
on
the
premises
of
another
after
he
was
ordered
to
get
away?
