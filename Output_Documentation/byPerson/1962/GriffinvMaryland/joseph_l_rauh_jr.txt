mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
to
review
the
trespass
conviction
of
the
petitioners
for
trying
to
ride
on
the
merry-go-round
at
glen
echo
amusement
park.
glen
echo
amusement
park
is
the
major
amusement
facility
of
the
national
capital
area.
shortly
after
7:00
in
the
evening,
on
june
30,1960,
a
number
of
persons,
negro
and
white,
gathered
outside
of
the
entrance
to
glen
echo
and
formed
a
picket
line.
approximately
an
hour
later,
the
five
petitioners,
young
negro
students,
entered
the
park.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
there
is
no
obstruction
at
this
park.
there
is
no
gate
at
the
park.
there
is
no
admission
tickets.
you
walk
on
to
the
park
and
then
you
buy
a
ticket
for
the
particular
thing
you
want;
a
merry-go-round
or
any
other
of
the
amusements
that
they
have
there,
the
roller
coaster
and
so
forth.
these
five
petitioners
went
on
to
the
land
where,
as
i
say,
there
is
no
obstruction,
they
walk
to
the
carousel.
they
had
tickets
which
had
been
given
to
them
by
the
white
associates,
tickets
being
admittedly
freely
transferable,
they
went
upon
the
merry-go-round
and
sat
on
the
horses
and
the
other
animals.
the
music
was
playing,
but
the
carousel
didn't
move.
instead,
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
francis
j.
collins
came
up
to
them.
he
had
on
the
uniform
of
a
private
detective
agency
by
which
he
was
employed
on
detail
to
the
glen
echo
amusement
park
and
had
on
his
lapel
of
his
shirt,
a
badge,
the
deputy
sheriff
badge
of
montgomery
county
which
have
been
given
to
him
pursuant
to
a
provision
of
montgomery
county
for
such
deputizing
of
sheriffs.
it
is
conceded
that
he
had
the
full
power
of
law
upon
glen
echo
amusement
park.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
what
had
happened
there
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
as
the
second
have
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we
are
the
overruling
at
the
second
half,
under
what
i
should
refer
to
as
the
justice
douglas'
opinion
in
the
garner
case,
that's
the
second
half
of
my
argument.
i
would
like
to
do
the
facts
and
then
the
first
half
which
is
simpler,
but
the
answer
to
your
question
is,
yes,
i
do
urge
the
reconsideration
of
the
civil
rights
cases.
it
is
not,
however,
a
necessary
part
of
my
case
by
any
manner
or
means,
but
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
was
thinking
as
listening
to
the
last
case
that
it
might
be
necessary
for
those
who
did
not
feel
that
shelley
and
kraemer
required
a
reversal
as
i
do.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
a
question,
your
honor,
as
to
whether
that
statute
would
in
fact
be
resurrected.
i'm
glad
to
say
it's
not
in
this
case
whether
it
would
do
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
might
be
resurrected.
i'm
not
certain.
we
have
considered
that
and
i
don't
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it's
never
been
repealed.
that's
as
much
as
i
can
say.
now
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
sir.
that
was
a
case
where
the
law
had
not
previously
been
held
unconstitutional,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
thompson
restaurant
case,
the
law
had
not
previously
been
held
unconstitutional.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it's
been
lost.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
and
you
held
that
it
was
in
effect.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
now
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
just
exactly
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precise
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
exactly.
here
is
mr.
collins
with
the
deputy
sheriff
on
his
lapel,
walks
up
and
says
to
these
five
young
negro
students
on
the
carousel,
“i
give
you
five
minutes
to
get
off
the
property.”
the
policy
of
the
park
is
not
to
have
colored
people
on
the
rides
or
in
the
park.
they
declined
to
move.
he
arrested
them.
he
went
--
they
went
to
an
office
to
a
substation
at
bethesda.
they
were
tried
and
this
is
what
came
out
at
the
trial.
collins
had
orders
from
the
owner
from
the
first
day
he
came
to
go
up
to
any
negro
on
the
premises,
warn
them
off
and,
if
they
wouldn't
leave,
arrest
them
for
trespassing.
he
had
orders
that
very
day
of
june
30,
1960
on
those
particular
people
from
the
manager,
“give
them
five
minutes
to
get
off
and,
if
they
don't
get
off,
arrest
them
for
trespassing.”
he
carried
on
his
orders.
we
raised
all
the
federal
questions
below
and
the
question
before
the
court
--
the
two
questions,
and
i'd
like
to
make
clear
what
i
see
as
the
two
questions
because
they
are
different
and
they
require
an
answer
to
justice
black's
question
about
the
civil
rights
cases.
i
say
that
shelley
and
kraemer
requires
a
reversal
and
that
even
if
it
did
not,
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
just
asked
me,
there
are
additional
points
here
above
that
which
do
require
a
reversal
such
is
the
fact
that
collins
was
everything
here.
collins
was
the
state.
he
was
the
agent
of
the
owner.
he
was
the
one
who
made
the
crime
by
ask
--
by
ordering
them
off.
he
was
--
here,
you
had
a
confluence
of
state
and
private
power
discriminating.
this
was
perfectly
clear
that
we
have
a
case
there
whether
you
apply
shelley
and
kraemer
to
the
simple
arrest
and
conviction
or
not.
but,
we
have
a
second
point,
whether
in
my
time
i
will
get
to
it,
but
i
want
to
state
it
now
before
i
elaborate
the
first
because
it
is
briefed
fully
and
because
i
consider
it
of
extreme
importance,
particularly
as
justice
black
asked
me,
for
those
who
take
a
different
view
of
shelley
and
kraemer,
it
might
be
important.
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
the
garner
case,
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
out
that
a
re
--
large
retail
establishment
might
very
well
be
required
to
serve
that
the
licensing
and
regulation
might
very
well
be
the
equivalent
of
state
action
and
that
a
retail
establishment
might
very
well
be
required
to
serve.
the
difference,
therefore,
between
my
two
points,
and
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
that
this
is
the
real
difference,
is
that
under
the
first
point,
they
can
sit
on
the
carousel,
but
under
the
second
point,
the
carousel
has
to
move.
in
other
words,
under
the
first
point,
you
have
a
right
to
sit
at
the
hamburger
stand
and
you
can't
be
removed
by
the
police
for
sitting
there
in
exercising
your
--
and
standing
there
and
seeking
service.
under
the
second
point,
which
does
require
the
overruling
of
the
civil
rights
cases,
the
second
point,
the
hamburger
must
be
served.
now,
the
case
does
not
involve
the
second
point
at
this
stage.
for
those
who
will
agree
on
the
first
point,
there
is
--
under
the
constitutional
doctrine
of
limit
--
taking
the
most
limited
ground,
one
would
not
get
to
the
second
point,
but
for
those
to
whom
the
first
point
would
seem
--
on
which
i
couldn't
get
an
agreement
on
the
first
point,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
squarely
raised
and
we
do
ask
a
reconsideration
of
the
civil
rights
cases.
now,
addressing
myself
to
the
first
point,
and
i'm
addressing
myself,
if
i
may,
to
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
of
new
york
or
montana
and
here
we
have
actually
a
little
mix
here.
we
have
maryland,
which
is
a
border
state,
but
i'm
perfectly
happy
to
treat
this
case
as
though
it
had
happened
in
montana
or
new
york
in
answer
to
that
question.
i
believe
that
the
mere
arrest
and
trial
and
conviction
of
a
negro
american
for
trespass
when
he
is
excluded
for
the
sole
reason
that
he
is
a
negro
is
a
violation
to
the
equal
protection
clause
and
is
a
clearer
case
than
shelley
and
kraemer.
i
think
if
this
court
had
had
the
two
cases
side
by
side
in
1948
and
if
it
only
had
this
--
and
had
made
a
rule
it
would
only
decide
one
of
them
in
favor
of
equal
protection,
we
would
have
won
that
competition,
and
i
think
that
for
three
reasons.
mr.
greenberg
made
the
first
one
very
eloquently
this
morning,
earlier,
when
he
said
that,
in
shelley
and
kraemer,
they
just
held
the
courts
open.
all
that
happened
in
shelley
and
kraemer
was
the
state
opened
its
courts.
here,
the
state
pulled
a
man
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
took
him
into
court.
certainly
that's
more
state
action
than
simply
leaving
your
courts
open.
secondly,
this
is
criminal
action
and
certainly,
a
--
without
--
certainly
a
stronger
action
than
civil
action
and,
thirdly,
i
think
this
is
critical,
maybe
the
man
in
shelley
and
kraemer
did
have
some
right
--
did
have
some
right
of
privacy.
the
man
in
shelley
and
kraemer
whose
property
right
was
really
circumscribed
by
this
court
was
a
man
who
had
made
an
arrangement
under
which
he
thought
negros
could
not
move
next
door.
there's
a
lot
more
privacy,
your
honors,
in
who
can
be
your
neighbor
than
in
who
you
serve
at
an
amusement
park
with
thousands
of
people
coming
in
there
every
day.
now,
i'm
not
suggesting,
i
don't
think
shelley
and
kraemer
is
correct.
i
think
it
was
eminently
correct,
but
i
am
suggesting
that
this
case
is
a
far
simpler
case
and
i'm
just
limiting
it
now
to
arrest
and
conviction,
that
this
is
a
far
simpler
case
than
shelley
against
kraemer.
if
i
may
address
myself
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
this
morning,
doesn't
the
owner
have
the
right
to
exclude?
well,
my
--
i
can
only
answer
a
question
with
another
question.
didn't
the
property
owner
in
shelley
and
kraemer
have
a
right
to
exclude?
yes,
he
did,
under
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
you
do
not
reach
that
in
my
judgment,
your
honor.
just
as
the
--
just
as
this
court
said
in
shelley
against
kraemer
that
the
restrictive
covenant
was
still
valid,
but
it
couldn't
be
enforced
in
equity
or
in
barrels
in
law.
so
here,
i
presume
this
man,
under
my
first
ground,
not
under
my
second
--
under
the
first
ground,
this
man
could
still
put
up
a
sign
“no
negros
admitted.”
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that,
if
your
honor
please,
is
a
difficult
question.
we
try
--
we've
addressed
ourselves
to
that
in
a
footnote
on
page
29.
in
a
word,
it
depends
on
this,
your
honor
--
could
--
suppose
he
does.
if
the
bouncer
pulls
him
off
the
property.
the
man
sues
for
battery.
the
bouncer
sets
up
the
right
as
a
defense.
then,
it
will
depend
on
whether
your
honors
decide
that
barrel
against
jackson
applies
because
you
are
encouraging
that
sort
of
thing
by
recognizing
this
defense.
i
know
of
no
--
the
barrel
--
barrels
against
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
have
--
in
fact,
the
result
of
my
argument
may
create
that,
although,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
and
we've
been
very
careful
to
point
out
in
our
brief
that
we
don't
believe
that
self-help
--
well,
ha
--
we
believe
the
self-help
is
a
bugaboo
that
it's
just
never
going
to
occur.
owners
of
public
establishments
don't
do
the
dirty
business
of
throwing
people
off
their
property.
what
has
held
this
segregation
in
america
together
is
the
fact
that
the
police
have
carried
it
out.
if
this
court
rules,
as
i
believe
it
must
unless
it
retreats
from
shelley
and
kraemer,
and
this
court
hasn't
retreated
from
a
civil
rights
case
in
my
lifetime,
if
this
court
makes
this
decision,
as
i
believe
it
would,
i
don't
believe
there's
a
slightest
shunt
that
there
will
be
a
major
self-help
operation.
businessmen
simply
don't
carry
it
out.
they
have
relied
on
the
police.
the
police
have
done
it
for
them,
and
that's
what
you
have
in
this
case.
as
to
whether,
legally,
there
will
be
a
right
of
self-help,
it
will
depend
on
this
court's
decision
on
whether
barrel
against
jackson
would
permit
that
defense
to
an
action
on
battery.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely
and,
matter
of
fact,
now
that
i've
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
sir.
you
bring
me
to
--
really
to
the
next
point.
you're
absolutely
right.
in
my
deep
conviction,
shelley
against
kraemer
applies
just
to
arrest
and
conviction,
i
have
deliberately
withheld
from
the
additional
part
of
the
case.
i
would
like
to
say
one
more
thing,
if
you
would
excuse
me,
sir.
on
the
shelley
and
kraemer
point,
why
i'm
so
convinced
that
this
an
easier
case
to
charge
kraemer
just
the
arrest
and
conviction.
if
your
honors
would
put
your
mind
to
a
license
of
a
state
which
said
--
well,
they
were
a
license
to
glen
echo
by
the
state
of
maryland.
they
have
a
license
from
the
state
of
maryland.
suppose
the
license
read
“to
serve
as
a
public
amusement
park,
whites
only.”
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
that's
illegal.
indeed,
under
the
--
justice
stewart's
concurring
opinion
in
the
burton
against
wilmington
parking
authority,
it
seems
to
me,
that's
exactly
what
he
is
talking
--
what
you
are
talking
about
there.
so,
this
is
clearly
--
i
don't
get
an
argument,
i
don't
believe,
in
saying
that
if
you
issue
the
license
for
whites
only,
that
that's
illegal.
what
difference
is
it
where
you
issue
a
neutral
license
and
put
the
whole
state
apparatus
to
reaching
the
result
of
“for
whites
only”?
what
real
difference
is
there
between
a
license
for
whites
only
and
a
neutral
license
with
the
entire
state
criminal
power
coming
down
to
make
it
operate
as
a
license
for
whites
only?
and,
on
this
basis,
i
would
conclude
my
belief
that
shelley
and
kraemer
applies
to
the
mere
arrest
and
conviction,
but
and
this
is
a
big
“but,”
actually,
there
is
far
more
in
the
instant
case
than
mere
judicial
enforcement
of
racial
discrimination.
so
much
more
that
maybe
i'm
engaging
in
wishful
thinking
and
hoping
that
the
problem
i
have
just
presented
will
reach
the
consideration
of
this
court.
here,
you
have
mr.
collins
with
a
deputy
sheriff's
badge
on
him,
running
the
day-to-day
operation
of
discrimination
of
glen
echo
park.
mr.
collins
was
the
chief
discriminator.
mr.
collins
created
the
crime.
this
is
very
interesting
if
you
think
about
it
for
a
moment.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no.
he
did
it
on
orders
from
his
employers
but
he
was
the
state
and
he
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
he
had
orders
from
the
beginning
of
his
employment
to
keep
negros
off
and
then,
in
this
particular
instance,
he
got
particular
orders.
so,
we
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
that
this
was
the
first
test
of
the
--
as
far
as
i
know,
this
was
the
first
test.
there
is
a
second
one
in
the
companion
case,
but
this
was
the
first
test.
so,
here
is
mr.
collins,
a
state
agent,
and
what
i
was
just
going
to
say,
he
created
the
crime.
by
that,
i
mean
in
order
for
this
to
have
been
a
crime,
the
supreme
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
said
that
it
was
not
a
crime
going
on
the
property.
the
only
crime
was
not
to
get
off
when
you
were
told
to
get
off.
now,
who
told
them
to
get
off?
mr.
collins.
this
was
an
essential
part
of
the
whole
case
and
there's
--
a
very
funny
thing
happened
here.
you
can't
tell
whether
collins
is
private
or
public.
if
your
honors
would
look
at
the
two
warrants,
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
record
there's
a
(b)
then
the
pages
aren't
numbered
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
record.
the
first
warrant
that
was
issued
under
f
(b),
here
on
the
record,
refers
in
the
middle,
“after
having
been
told
by
the
deputy
sheriff
for
glen
echo
park
to
leave
the
property.
well,
that
didn't
commit
a
crime
because
he
had
to
be
told
by
an
agent
of
the
owner
to
get
off
the
property.
so,
look
at
(c),
if
your
honors
would
do
me
that
favor,
where
they
changed
that
in
the
amended
warrant
to
say,
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
“after
having
been
dully
notified
by
an
agent
of
kebar
inc.”
here,
you
had
the
private
and
public
activities
of
this
man,
collin,
so
mixed
up
that
they
--
that
when
they
write
the
warrants
they
don't
know
which
to
say.
first,
they
say
he
was
acting
as
a
policeman,
then,
they
say
he
was
acting
as
an
agent.
well,
the
truth
of
the
matter
is,
if
i
may
misuse
the
word,
he
was
a
double
agent.
he
was
perfectly
clearly
an
agent
for
the
owners
and
he
was
perfectly
clearly
an
agent
of
the
state
as
the
police.
and,
i
suggest
that
one
doesn't
have
to
go
any
farther
with
this
case
than
the
very
simple
proposition
that
when
a
private
party
discriminates
against
negros
and
the
agent,
for
carrying
out
that
discrimination
on
a
day-to-day
basis,
is
the
state,
there
is
a
clear
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
precisely,
your
honor,
and
under
page
a,
the
very
first
page
which
is
the
application
for
the
warrant,
he's
in
there
as
the
deputy
sheriff
and
he
said,
as
such,
he
did
leave
the
thing
so
that
it's
quite
correct
to
say
that
you
have
this
complete
relationship
here.
now,
at
this
stage
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
deputized
police?
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
you
mean
the
ordinary
po
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
but,
no
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
there
are
two
diff
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
there
are
two
differences,
your
honor,
between
what
happened
here
and
what
i
would
call
the
naked
shelley-kraemer
arrest
versus
arrest
and
conviction,
there
are
two
differences.
in
the
first
place,
this
man
got
in
earlier
than
a
policeman.
in
other
words,
he
was
there
on
the
spot.
he
was
the
agent
to
make
the
crime.
he
was
not
just
called
in
after
they
wanted
him
off.
he
was
the
one
that
ordered
him
off.
so,
first
place,
it's
earlier
in
relationship
and,
second
place,
he
had
no
discretion.
suppose
the
policeman
had
come
on,
a
very
nice
policeman
that
was
trying
to
do
his
job,
sees
five
young
negro
students
on
a
merry-go-round.
now,
the
first
thing
a
policeman
who
isn't
an
agent
is
going
to
say
to
himself
“well,
my
goodness!
how
can
you
arrest
five
nice-looking
young
students
for
wanting
to
ride
on
a
horse
on
a
merry-go-round?”
and,
he'd
say
“well,
the
first
thing
i'm
going
to
try
to
do
is
see
if
i
can
settle
this.”
so,
he'd
say
to
the
manager
“let
them
alone”
the
man
--
or
he
would
try
to
say
to
the
boys
“well,
will
you
go
after
one
ride?”
he
isn't
going
to
just
automatically
arrest
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
but
this
man
would
automatically
arrest
because
this
man
was
paid.
his
job
was
to
arrest
them.
his
job
in
his
private
capacity
was
to
arrest
them,
and
he
carried
out
without
ever
considering
and
saying
“can't
we
think
of
some
way
out
of
this
rather
than
an
arrest
here?”
and
that,
i
suggest,
is
the
two
differences,
your
honor,
both
on
time
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
a
discretion
in
here.
he
might
leave
it
to
a
civil
action.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
he
might.
there
are
cases
in
which
the
man
thinks
that
the
matter
is
of
such
small
degree.
you
don't
get
an
arrest
on
every
criminal
action
in
this
country.
he
might,
if
he
felt
it
was
a
minor
infraction,
he
might
leave
it
for
some
civil
action.
in
all
probability,
he
would
have
arrested
after
he'd
tried
mediation.
i
will
go
that
far
with
your
honor.
now,
just
in
conclusion
of
point
one,
i'd
like
to
just
make
a
reference
to
the
difference
bet
--
in
the
government's
position
and
our
own
in
this
case.
the
government
relies
entirely
on
what
i
have
just
referred
to
what
mr.
justice
goldberg
referred
to
as
the
additional
points,
collins,
his
badge,
putting
together
private.
i
say
that
there
are
two
grounds
here,
both
in
the
shelley
and
kraemer
grounds
and
that
the
government
only
makes
the
second
of
the
grounds.
the
government
apparently
feels
that
the
second
ground
is
conclusive.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
first
ground
here
is
equally
strong,
but
that,
together,
they
leave
no
question
as
to
the
outcome.
it
is,
therefore,
with
a
certain
amount
of
humility
that
i
would
argue
the
second
point.
however,
it
does
become
relevant,
as
justice
black
indicated,
for
those
who
might
not
accept
the
first
argument,
we
take
the
position
in
point
two
of
our
brief
that
glen
echo
didn't
have
any
right
to
discriminate,
that
the
use
of
the
words
“lawful
right
to
discriminate”
or
“lawful
right
--”
i
think
that
we
u
--
the
use
of
the
words
below
were
“lawful
policy
of
segregation”
is
a
misnomer.
we
accept
the
statement
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
garner
that
those
who
run
a
retail
establishment
under
permit
from
a
municipality
operate,
in
my
view,
a
public
facility
in
which
there
can
be
no
more
discrimination
based
on
race
than
is
constitutionally
permitted
in
the
more
customary
type
of
public
facility.
now,
let
us
look
at
this
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
fourteenth
amendment,
if
your
honor
please,
the
equal
protection
clause.
and,
i
might
say
there
that
i
don't
put
much
stock
in
people
who
say
“if
you
do
something
on
equal
protection
clause,
you're
sure
going
to
cause
a
lot
of
trouble
under
due
process,
the
red-head
case
and
so
forth,”
that
seems
to
me
to
be
just
a
trumped
up
point.
the
fact
is
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
this
court
has
said
and
said,
was
primarily
designed
for
the
benefit
of
the
colored
race
and
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
we
--
that
rules
that
will
be
set
up
on
equal
protection
clause
which
is
absolute
do
not
necessarily
determine
how
the
due
process
clause
would
apply
in
the
future
to
the
same
institution,
and
i'm
referring
here
to
glen
echo.
look
at
glen
echo
now.
this
is
the
major
amusement
facility
in
this
whole
area
of
a
1.5
million
people.
now,
it
may
--
the
licenses
you
have
to
get
are
legit.
they
are
set
forth
on
page
33
of
our
brief.
the
regulation,
the
determined
regulation
of
this
place
is
legit,
the
support
that
they
get
from
the
state.
so,
what
you
have
here,
looked
at
as
the
point
of
state
regulation
is
licensing
regulation
and
support.
but,
then
you
have
something
else,
and
this
i
would
suggest,
this
is
an
in
--
an
activity
affected
with
the
public
interest.
this
is
one
closed
with
a
vital
public
interest.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
if
your
honor
is
now
referring
to
the
cases
in
which
the
government
of
state
and
federal
can
regulate,
i
would
say,
under
this
court's
decision,
that
the
legislative
body
would
generally
be
accepted
in
what
they
did
so
hold.
and,
i
do
accept
that,
your
honor,
but
there
--
i
would
say
that
how
far
that
may
go,
one
doesn't
know
now.
i'm
saying
what
i
do
know,
is
that
this
interest,
this
is
a
big
operation,
this
is
a
big
public
interest
in
this
area.
whether
you
look
at
this
institution
from
the
fact
of
the
state
down,
licensing
regulation
and
so
forth,
or
from
the
effect
on
the
community,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
here
a
significant
governmental
action,
a
significant
state
action,
whether
done
through
the
fact
of
licensing
regulation
and
support,
as
justice
douglas
points
out,
or
whether,
because
of
the
tremendous
significance
of
the
operation,
it
takes
on
characteristics
of
state
action
and
put
together
this
is
--
this
organization
cannot
discriminate
--
it
does
not
have
a
lawful
power.
under
this
line
of
reasoning,
the
sign
“negros
only”
would
be
illegal.
under
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
is
the
state
for
the
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
for
the
purpose
of
--
i
want
to
qualify
myself
as
carefully
as
i
can.
it
is
the
state
for
the
purpose
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
i
think
the
way
--
we
can't
go
to
say
everything.
i
don't
have
--
we
don't
have
that
case
here.
there
are
going
to
be
situations
where
it
may
not
rise
to
the
dignity
of
saying
this.
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
there
is
a
privacy
there
and
i
wouldn't
--
i
would
say
probably
not.
i
would
like
to
say
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
heaven
save
me
from
discussing
a
club
to
which
would
undermine
along.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
there
must
be
state
action
and
come
--
i'd
like
to
address
myself
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
civil
rights
case
has
said
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
only
applies
to
state
action,
not
to
private
action.
that
does
not
have
to
be
overruled
for
any
purpose,
i
accept
that.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
think
they
have
to
be
overruled
for
another
purpose.
the
civil
rights
cases
involved
a
statute
of
the
federal
government
on
amusement
parks,
private
amusement
parks.
now,
i
would
assume
they
would
have
to
be
overruled
and
it
has
to
be
overruled
because
if
the
federal
government
couldn't
regulate
the
private
amusement
park
in
this
regard,
then
i
would
assume
that
the
state
could
use
its
power
to
enforce
the
act.
in
other
words,
if
this
were
in
fact,
what
i
say
it
is,
a
part
of
the
state
then
the
civil
rights
statutes
would
have
been
constitutional,
not
unconstitutional
as
your
honors
--
as
the
previous
court
held,
but
that
brings
me
to
what
it
seems
to
me
is
the
fundamental
problem
here
on
this
second
point.
two
cases
were
decided
in
the
retreat
from
the
fourteenth
amendment.
one
was
plessy
against
ferguson,
one
was
a
civil
rights
act
--
one
was
a
civil
rights
case.
in
both
of
these,
there
were
brilliant
dissents
which
foresaw
the
future.
in
one
of
these,
this
court
has
now
reversed
and
accepted
that
dissenting
opinion,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
dissenting
opinion
was
right
here
and
that
the
real
explanation
for
this
case
was
that,
at
that
time,
the
real
doctrine
of
--
the
doctrine
of
property
rights
was
on
top
and
the
doctrine
of
human
rights
was
under
that.
in
this
situation,
it
seems
to
me,
the
time
has
come
to
overrule
the
civil
rights
cases.
now,
i
say
that,
and
again
would
like
to
end
and
save
the
rest
of
my
time
with
the
thought
that,
except
for
those
who
don't
believe
in
the
first
point,
i
do
not
--
i
quite
agree
that
i
have
argued
more
than
is
before
the
court.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
think
that,
as
one
lawyer
up
here
once
said
when
he
made
a
suggestion
on
that
ground,
he
got
a
supreme
court
justice
angry.
i
shall
not
do
the
same.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
first,
just
think
we
ought
to
just
clear
up
once
more,
mr.
justice
goldberg
did
it.
i'd
like
to
do
it
again
just
to
who
this
man,
collins,
was.
if
you
look
at
a,
first
place,
mr.
--
my
brother
here
said
that
he
was
not
arresting
as
a
police
officer.
a
makes
clear
that
he
was
because,
after
the
words
in
the
third
line
on
page
a
“deputy
sheriff,”
it
says
“and
as
such.”
they
stuck
the
word
the
--
you
didn't
have
to
stick
in
the
word
there
“as
such”
to
make
it
as
clear
as
a
nose
on
your
face
but
it's
what
they
did.
“as
such”
he
was
acting
as
a
police
officer.
then,
on
page
14,
if
your
honors
would
do
me
the
courtesy
of
turning
to
page
14,
mr.
murphy
suggested
that
there
was
no
evidence
he
was
--
he
had
this
badge
on
the
outside.
may
i
read
the
quote?
may
i
read
mr.
collins'
testimony?
it
said
“what
uniform?”
“i
was
in
uniform.”
“what
uniform
was
that?”
“of
the
national
detective
agency,
blue
pants,
white
shirt,
black
tie,
and
white
coat
and
wearing
a
special
deputy
sheriff's
badge.”
the
word
“wearing”
is
there.
now,
i'm
presuming
that
the
word
“wearing”
does
not
mean
on
the
inside,
which
would
be
a
most
uncomfortable
way
of
having
a
deputy
sheriff's
badge.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
excuse
me,
sir,
on
page
14
of
the
record.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
about
the
sixth
or
seventh
of
the
line,
“wearing
a
special
deputy
sheriff's
badge.”
then,
mr.
murphy
suggests
that
maybe
we
didn't
have
something
to
--
the
park
didn't
have
much
to
do
with
this
man.
and,
if
you'll
go
down
just
about
six
more
lines,
it
says,
question,
“and
specifically
by
what
two
organizations
are
you
employed?”
“rekab
inc.
and
kebar
inc.
which
are
the
two
corporations
which
own
glen
echo.”
then,
on
page
55
of
the
record,
if
your
honors
please,
which
leaves
any
--
which
removes
any
last
doubt
about
who
was
running
lieutenant
collins,
“does
the
national
detective
agency,”
right
at
the
top
of
page
55,
“make
their
employees
available
to
you
and
you
direct
them
as
you
see
fit?”
“you,”
this
is
a
question
to
the
manager,
“direct
them
as
you
see
fit.”
“that
is
correct.”
in
other
words,
there
is
no
question
that
this
man,
collins,
had
the
badge
on
his
shirt
and
was
under
the
direction
of
the
management,
and
you
get
a
confluence
of
state
and
private
power
to
discriminate
against
these
people
and
i
don't
think
there
is
--
anything
goes
beyond
that.
mr.
murphy
suggested
that
--
i
think
this
--
i
don't
know,
it
was
said
just
at
the
end
of
the
sentence,
but
i
did
want
to
correct
it,
that
this
was
--
that
they
--
precisely
why
they
came
to
the
park
was
to
get
arrested.
this
is
not
correct,
if
your
honors
please.
on
page
61
of
the
record,
a
witness
testified
on
this
very
point.
towards
the
end
of
page
61,
a
witness
who
had
been
there
as
part
of
their
group
said
“you
thought
you
would
be
able
to
use
the
facilities
of
glen
echo
park.”
“i
thought
i
might.”
this,
in
fact,
is
the
truth.
they
wanted
to
use
them.
they
wanted
to
breakdown
segregation.
they
didn't
know
whether
they
would
or
they
wouldn't.
the
truth
of
the
matter
was,
and
the
record
is
clear
on
this,
they
honestly
didn't
know
what
would
happen.
it
has
been
the
experience
in
the
last
year
since
the
city
of
movement
started
but,
very
often,
when
people
went
and
it
was
finally
--
the
management
finally
had
to
make
the
final
decision,
they
made
the
honorable
one.
and,
there
was
a
chance
here
and
in
fact,
within
a
year,
they
did
make
the
honorable
one
and
it
was
opened
up.
now,
just
to
come
back,
so
much
for
collins
and
that
part
of
the
case,
to
come
back
to
shelley
and
kraemer,
the
chief
justice
asked
mr.
murphy
for
a
distinction
of
shelley
and
kraemer.
the
suggestion
is
that,
in
shelley
and
kraemer,
there
was
a
willing
buyer
and
a
willing
seller.
here,
that
there
is
an
unwilling
seller.
that
is
a
difference
and
i
respectfully
suggest
it
is
a
most
meaningless
difference
because
in
shelley
against
kraemer,
there
was
a
property
right,
just
as
there
is
here.
who
was
the
property
right
in?
it
was
in
the
covenanter
who
wanted
to
keep
negros
from
being
his
neighbors.
there
was
a
covenant
in
shelley
and
kraemer
where
a
man
said
to
another
man
“we
agree
that
no
negro
will
go
on
your
property
because
i
don't
want
a
negro
next
to
me.”
the
second
man
violated
his
contract
and
sold.
this
court
held
that,
although
that
was
a
property
right
and
this
court
wasn't
saying
it
was
illegal
to
try
and
have
that
covenant,
you
would
neither
allow
an
injunction
against
that
or
damages
for
the
breach
of
that.
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here,
under
this
half
of
the
case,
that
this
man
here,
this
owner
of
glen
echo,
had
a
right
to
say
no
negros
but
he
didn't
have
a
right
to
get
the
state
to
enforce
it
for
him
anymore
than
the
covenanter
had
a
right
not
to
have
a
negro
neighbor,
had
a
right
to
have
the
state
enforce
that
for
him.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
re-argument.
though
the
legal
issues
are
of
moment
and
importance,
the
facts
are
simple
and
largely
undisputed.
on
january
30,
1960,
a
number
of
persons,
negro
and
white,
including
the
five
petitioners
here,
gathered
outside
of
glen
echo
amusement
park,
the
major
amusement
park
serving
the
district
of
columbia.
it
is
in
maryland.
a
picket
line
protesting
the
assumed
position
of
the
park
of
segregation
was
setup,
and
shortly
thereafter,
about
8:15
in
the
evening,
the
five
petitioners,
young
negroes,
went
into
the
park.
there
was
no
obstruction
as
there
are
no
tickets
or
other
entry
required
for
gaining
admission
to
the
park.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
they
went
on
to
the
carousel
and
took
their
places
on
the
horses
and
other
animals
there.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
and
they
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
had
tickets
purchased
by
a
white
friend
and
it
is
not
contested
that
the
tickets
were
freely
transferable.
so,
on
the
carousel,
the
five
negroes
had
the
tickets
that
were
required
and
waited
to
ride
but
they
didn't
ride.
the
carousel
didn't
move
and
a
man
named
francis
j.
collins
walked
up
to
them.
he
had
on
the
uniform
of
the
national
detective
agency,
a
private
detective
agency,
and
he
was
employed
by
the
park
through
a
contract
with
the
national
detective
agency.
he
had
on
the
badge
of
deputy
sheriff
of
the
state
of
maryland,
and
he
said
to
these
five
petitioners
"we
do
not
permit
negroes
on
the
property
here
or
on
the
rides.
i
will
give
you
five
minutes
to
leave
the
property."
in
an
orderly
fashion,
there
is
no
question
about
this,
they
sat
quietly
on
the
carousel.
approximately
five
minutes
thereafter,
he
arrested
them.
he
took
them
to
the
bethesda
police
station
and,
there,
he
swore
out
a
warrant.
he
filed
an
application
for
a
warrant
and
the
justice
of
the
peace
issued
the
warrant
and
charged
them
under
27
maryland
code,
section
577,
for
wanton
trespass.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
now,
at
--
and
i
was
just
exactly
at
that
point.
at
the
trial,
there
was
testimony
of
all
three,
of
lieutenant
collins
that
he
had
instructions
from
the
first
to
arrest
if
negroes
came
on
for
trespass,
that
he
had
instructions,
that
those
instructions
came
from
the
owner,
mr.
baker,
that
he
also
had
the
same
instructions
from
the
manager,
but
it
is
correct
that
he
went
to
the
manager
and
said
“these
five
negroes
are
on
there.
what
shall
i
do?”
and,
he
said
“arrest
them.”
that
is
correct,
but
all
three
-
collins,
baker,
and
warren
hoff,
the
manager,
testified
it
was
the
policy
to
keep
them
off
solely
because
they
were
negroes
and
the
arrest
was
to
be
made
by
lieutenant
collins
solely
where
it
--
because
they
were
negroes
and
lieutenant
collins
made
the
arrest
solely
because
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
he
was
--
that
was
the
title
assigned
to
him
as
head
of
the
police
force
of
the
glen
echo
park.
i
think
it's
someone
like
a
kentucky
colonel,
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
think
it
evidences
the
whole
picture.
he
wore
the
badge
of
the
deputy
sheriff.
he
went
to
the
police
station
and
made
an
application
as
a
deputy
sheriff.
and
then
the
warrant
itself
says
that
it
was
sworn
out
by
the
deputy
sheriff.
in
other
words,
there
was
a
continuous
--
as
i
will
come
to
in
my
argument,
there
is
a
continuous
confluence
of
private
and
public
authority
in
this
case.
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
now,
at
the
trial,
as
i
say,
the
--
it
was
very
simple
and
the
federal
points
were
all
raised.
there's
no
question
about
that.
the
five
young
negroes
were
convicted
and
fined
of
trespass.
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
upheld
the
convictions
on
the
ground
that
the
discrimination
by
the
state,
if
such
there
was,
was
one
step
removed,
that
the
action
here
was
one
step
removed
from
state
enforcement
of
a
policy
of
segregation.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
we
have
two
separate
arguments
which
we
make
in
support
of
our
position
that
these
convictions
must
be
reversed
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
first,
there
was
active
state
support
of
private
discrimination
forbidden
by
this
court.
and,
second,
and
the
other
half,
the
first
argument
assumes
a
private
right
to
discriminate
but
we
say,
under
the
first
argument,
private
right
to
discriminate,
though
there
maybe,
the
state
may
not
give
its
active
support
to
that
private
right
to
discriminate.
and,
secondly
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
my
secondly
was
going
to
answer
that,
if
your
honor
please.
and,
secondly,
though
there
is
no
private
right
to
discriminate,
in
other
words,
we
contend,
your
honor,
so
that
obviously
my
first
answer
is
“though
there
maybe”
would
have
been
a
better
way
to
say
the
first
point.
we
say
that
though
there
may
be
a
private
right
to
discriminate,
there
is
no
right
in
the
state
to
give
active
support
to
that
discrimination.
but,
second,
we
challenge
under
the
rule
of
law
in
this
country,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
a
state
can
create
or
recognize
a
private
right
of
discrimination.
it
will
not
be
necessary,
in
my
judgment,
for
the
court
to
reach
the
second
point,
because
i
believe
and
submit
that
the
first
point,
which
i'd
like
to
develop
now,
is
so
complete
and
total
and
clear
under
the
precedents
of
this
court.
nevertheless
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
should
have
made
that
clear.
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
i
am
saying
that,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
no
state
may
create
or
recognize,
this
is
the
second
point
we
--
i
--
as
i
say
again
i
want
to
be
clear
that
i
don't
think
this
court
will
ever
reach
this
point
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
in
this
case,
but
that
i
believe,
and
i
think
it
illuminates
the
first
point
and
shows
its
simplicity
that
no
state
may
create
or
recognize
a
private
right
of
racial
discrimination.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
if
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
solicitor
general
has
argued
the
vagueness
point
in
great
depth.
i
think
it
would
be
correct
except
for
one
thing.
it
was
not
raised
by
us
below
and
i
feel
the
most
i
could
do
is
refer
to
it
as
background
in
a
footnote,
which
we
do
on
page
27
of
our
brief,
that
i
do,
in
all
canter,
have
to
report
to
the
court
this
matter
was
not
raised
below.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
will
be
necessary,
if
your
honor
please,
but
if
that
--
if
the
court
determined
that
were
necessary,
i
think
the
court
made
an
assumption
in
the
civil
rights
cases,
which
i'll
come
to,
which
require
--
which
do
not
require
its
overruling
but,
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
we're
going
to
get
there
because
i
think
i
can
persuade
your
honors,
if
i
maybe
so
immodest,
mr.
justice
that
the
first
point
is
clear
and,
as
i
might
say,
rather
an
a
fortiori
case
under
the
previous
decision.
now,
look
at
this
situation
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
could
have,
your
honor,
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
same
considerations
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
would
bring
are
fully
encompassed.
the
badge
of
humiliation,
discrimination
in
a
public
accommodation
is
a
badge
of
humiliation
and
inferiority.
clearly,
as
such,
it's
a
leftover
part
of
slavery
and
clearly,
as
such,
i
could
have
raised
it
under
the
thirteenth
amendment.
i
think
that
badge
of
inferiority
and
humiliation,
which
this
discrimination
refers,
is
also
invalidated
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
this
is
a
simple
case
under
the
decided
precedents
of
this
court.
no
more,
we
say,
may
the
state
of
maryland
bring
a
judicial
trespass
action
against
one
who
seeks
service
at
a
public
accommodation
than
the
state
of
missouri
in
shelley
and
kraemer
could
bring
a
judicial
ejectment
action
to
remove
the
negro
from
the
land.
we
suggest
that
this
is
a
far
stronger
case
than
shelley
against
kraemer,
for
here,
the
criminal
law
of
the
state
is
being
brought
down
upon
a
man
seeking
service
and,
here,
it
is
not
as
in
shelley
and
kraemer
where
the
court
simply
were
open
to
the
man.
furthermore,
the
right
in
shelley
and
kraemer
was
a
higher
right
than
the
right
here.
the
right
in
shelley
and
kraemer,
which
this
court
overruled,
which
this
court
refused
to
honor,
was
the
right
--
the
contract
right
of
a
man
to
choose
his
neighbors.
and,
i
most
respectfully
suggest
that
the
overwriting
of
that
contractual
property
right
to
choose
one's
neighbor
in
shelley
and
kraemer
makes
it
easy
and
simple
and
less
far-out-too-over
to
say
that
an
owner
of
a
store
may
not
refuse
a
sandwich
to
a
person.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
there
is
a
great
deal
or
higher
right
in
the
covenant
that
was
overruled
and
invalidated
in
shelley
and
kraemer
that
could
not
be
enforced
in
shelley
and
kraemer
than
the
right
we
have
here.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
think
that
is
a
correct
statement,
your
honor,
but
it
just
needs
to
go
one
step
further
and
look
at
the
right
of
the
man
who
had
a
contract
right
not
to
have
a
negro
next
to
him.
that
contract
right
not
to
have
the
neighbor
was
said
by
this
court
to
be
unenforceable,
and
i
certainly
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
it
is
a
greater
right
to
have
your
neighbors
those
you
want
and
to
have
your
customers
those
you
want,
because
they're
saying
to
the
public
"thousands
of
you
people
come
to
glen
echo
and
ri--
and
take
part
in
our
rides
but
no
negroes."
and,
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
mr.
baker,
the
owner
who
makes
this
decision,
to
him,
i
can't
believe
who
rides
on
his
merry-go-round
to
be
as
high
a
right
as
to
mr.
baker's
neighbors.
and
as
your
honor
said
you
could
not
enforce
mr.
baker's
property
right
to
his
neighbors
and
i
suggest
you
--
that
the
same
point,
and
only
more
so,
as
you
cannot
enforce
a
property
right,
if
there
is
one
because
this
is
my
first
half
of
the
argument
and
i'm
assuming
that
you're
right,
if
there
is
one,
it
cannot
be
enforced
here.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
the
ejector
was
the
neighbor
who
had
a
contractual
covenant
with
the
man
who
sold
the
property
to
the
negro
that
the
man
wouldn't
sell
it.
he
had
a
perfectly
good
covenant
wer
--
writing
with
the
land,
a
perfectly
good
contract
property
interest,
which
this
court
said
may
not
be
enforced
because
the
fourteenth
amendment
won't
allow
the
courts
to
do
this
and,
by
the
same
token,
the
fourteenth
amendment
will
no
more
allow
the
criminal
trespass
action
than
a
criminal
ejectment
action.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
he
was
the
defendant.
he
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
he
was
the
petitioner.
he
was
the
buyer,
the
negro
buyer.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
the
cov--
the
ejectment
action
is
brought
by
the
neighbor
who
wants
to
get
rid
of
the
negroes
on
the
land.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
now,
that
would
be
clear
just
from
the
conviction.
but,
here,
you
have
more.
here,
you
have,
from
the
minute
this
thing
starts
to
the
end,
a--
just
a
confluence
of
public
and
private
authority.
this
sheriff
was
the
day-to-day
discriminator.
the
sheriff
was
on
the
land.
he
had
the
job
of
controlling
the
discrimination.
there
never
would
have
been
a
crime
if
it
wasn't
for
this
sheriff.
this
sheriff
said
"get
off
the
land."
it
was
only
a
crime
after
the
sheriff
had
told
them
to
get
off
the
land.
it
wasn't
a
crime
before.
there
is
no
suggestion
it
was
a
crime
walking
on.
the
suggestion
and
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
is
it's
a
crime
not
to
get
off
and,
when
they
don't--
and
who
made
that
crime?
the
orders
came
from
a
sheriff
of
the
state
of
maryland.
then,
he
goes,
as
i
was
questioned
on
this,
then
he
goes
to
the
police
station.
he
applies
as
a
police
officer,
then,
the
warrant
comes
on
application
of
a
police
officer.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh,
it
was
amended
on
the
question
of
whether
he
was
the
agent
of
the
owner.
they
didn't
have
a
crime
the
way
they
did
it
first
because
they
said
that
he
was
sworn
out
by
the
deputy
sheriff
and
then
they
had
to
say
he
was
sworn
out
by
the
agent.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
nothing
could
show,
if
your
honor
please,
the
mixture.
they
had
mixture
of
public
and
private
authority
better
than
they
had
to
fix
up
their
warrant
to
show
he
was
the--
that
the
sheriff
was
an
agent
of
the
private
authority
here
to
do
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
he
were
--
if
i
may,
if
you'll
excuse
the
expression,
i
think
m--
lieutenant
collins
was
a
double
agent.
he
was
an
agent
of
the
state
as
a
sheriff
and
he
was
an
agent
of
the
private
person
to
handle
their
discrimination.
it
just
seems
to
me
that
this
case
is
clear
on
shelley
but
it's
clear
on
two
other
cases
of
this
court.
it's
clear
on
burton.
i
don't
think
the
state
of
maryland
can
lease
its
badge
anymore
than
the
state
of
delaware
could
lease
its
property
for
discriminatory
purposes.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
said
so
and
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
but
it's
not
only
burton.
it's
lombard,
even
as
late
as
this
very
year.
lombard,
the
police
said
"we
promise
to
deal
with
the
sit-iners."
well,
here,
there
wasn't
even
a
promise.
there
was
actual
police
dealing
with
the
sit-iners.
so,
just
to
conclude
this
point,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it's,
as
justice
douglas
put
it
that
you
couldn't
license
a
man
to
serve
whites
only.
well,
that's
what
the
state
of
maryland,
in
effect,
is
doing.
they're
licensing
and
then
they're
making
it
possible
through
convictions,
through
sheriffs,
to
serve
whites
only.
the
obvious
fact
that
you
couldn't
license
a
man
to
serve
whites
only
is
really
applicable
here
when,
in
fact,
you
license
the
man
to
serve
the
public
and
then
you
make
it
possible
for
him
to
serve
whites
only.
well,
i--
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
we'd
come
to
the
second
point
but
i
do
think
it
illuminates
the
problem
and
it
is
because
of
its
illumination
that
i
would
so
much
like
to
dwell
on
it
before--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
there's
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
there
is
a
difference,
your
honor,
but
i
respectfully
suggest
the
difference
is
in
my
favor,
because,
as
you
put
it,
you
overlook
or
--
i
don't
mean
you
overlooked,
and
in
that
sense,
i
meant
that
it
excludes
the
important
fact
in
shelley
and
kraemer
of
the
property
right,
which
has
always
been
enforced.
there's
no
question
that
if
this
property
right
were
in
any
other
fashion,
it
would
be
enforced.
i
don't
see
what
the
willing
buyer
and
the
willing
seller
make
any
difference
when
you
got
an
unwilling
man
with
a
property
right
that
would
always
be
enforced
in
our
country
that's
never
been
challenged.
it
can
only
be
challenged
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
you
overruled
that
property
right
not
to
have
your
neighbor.
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
it's
a
lot
less
to
override
the
property
right
not
to
have
customers
than
to
override
the
property
right
not
to
have
neighbors.
now,
if
you
want
to
say
to
me
it's
different,
i
would
concede
it
was
different.
only,
i
would
only
contest
that
it's
different
in
my
favor,
and
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
there
has
been
a
lot
of
talk
in
the
articles
and
so
forth
that
there's
something--
that
there
is
some
question
about
shelley
and
kraemer.
well,
as
far
as
i
know,
and
i
think
i
have
read
all
the
relevant
decisions
of
this
court,
every
time
shelley
and
kraemer
has
been
mentioned,
it
has
been
mentioned
with
a
probation
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
there
is
no
way
to
reach
a
result
different
than
a
reversal
here
without,
in
fact,
questioning
the
result
in
shelley
and
kraemer.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
i
would
like
to
come
to
the
second
point.
i
do
most
seriously
challenge
that
there
is
any
private
right
to
discriminate
at
a
place
of
public
accommodation.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
and
i
was
trying,
without
wasting
time,
to
exclude
the
home
problem,
which
seems
to
me,
to
raise
contrary
constitutional
and
policy
questions
and
i
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
i
would
exclude
any
place
where
the
--
there
was
no
invitation
open
to
the
public.
if,
however,
i
invited
all
republicans
into
my
home,
i
don't
think
--
i
think
i'd
be
waving
my
rights
of
privacy
and
so
that
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that--
but
i
don't--
luckily
for
me,
i'm--
i
was--
the
formula
i
gave
covered
the
case
involved
which
is
that
i
challenge
that
there
is
any
private
right
of
racial
discrimination
in
a
place
of
public
accommodation,
and
for
this
reason--
and,
it
seems
to
me,
it's
quite--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
con--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
equal
protection
clause.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
equal
protection
clause
prevents
a
state
from
creating
or
recognizing
a
private
right
to
discriminate.
now,
law
doesn't
come
from
the
heavens
or
the--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i--
again,
i
say
that
these
borderline
case
--
but
i
don't
believe
the
church
has
that
right.
i
don't
believe
the
church
has
that
right.
i
think
it
can
have
only
catholics.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
think--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
on
racial
grounds,
your
honor.
this
court
has
made
one
thing
clear,
it
seems
to
me,
beyond
peradventure
of
doubt
and
that
racial
discrim--
racial
distinctions
are
the
one
type
of
distinction
that
you
will
not
honor
under
any
certainty,
that
race
is
the
one--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
by
a
state,
and
i
shall
respect--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
on
this
ground,
the
law
doesn't
come
from
the
heavens
or
out
of
the
earth.
the
law
is
created
by
the
state.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
fourteenth--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
the
law
of
the
state
cannot,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
create
or
recognize
a
right
of
discrimination
--
of
racial
discrimination,
because
it
is
the
state
then
that
is
setting
up
this
property
right.
that's
the
state
action
as
the
state,
whether
it's
by
common
law
or
statutory
law,
the
state
is
creating
and
recognizing
a
right
of
discrimination
and
it's--
if
the--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
words
“may
not
deny
protection,
equal
protection,”
that
the
states
may
not
deny
it,
by
such,
they
may
not
create
a
property
right
to
discriminate
against
negroes.
now,
if
i
would--
i
want
to
bring
this
back
to
shelley
and
kraemer.
if
shelley
and
kraemer
is
correct
both
on
its
reasoning
and
its
result,
our
case
must
be
reversed
on
both.
in
other
words,
if
shelley
and
kraemer--
where
that
was
an
assumed
private
right
to
discriminate
which
could
not
be
enforced
in
the
courts,
then
you
can
assume
a
private
right
to
discriminate
here
which
cannot
be
enforced
in
the
court.
but,
i
respectfully
suggest
there's
a
better
view
of
shelley
and
kraemer.
there
is
a
view
of
shelley
and
kraemer
that
there
was
no
private
right
to
discriminate,
that
the
state
had
no
right
to
create
or
recognize
a
restrictive
covenant
against
allowing
negroes
into
the
neighborhood.
in
other
words,
that
some
of
the
criticism
of
shelley
and
kraemer,
namely
that
that
created
a
right,
that
there
was
a
private
right
which
couldn't
be
enforced,
i
most
respectfully
suggest
that
a
better
rationalization
of
shelley
and
kraemer
might
now
be
that
the
state
couldn't
create
or
recognize
a
restrictive
covenant.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but
the
state
created
the
substantive--
the
common
or
statutory
law
which
made
that
a
right,
and
i'm
respectfully
suggesting
that
state
action--
that
it
is
state
action
when
the
state,
either
by
its
common
law
or
its
statutory
law,
either
creates
or
recognizes
the
validity
of
that
restrictive
covenant.
and
i
am
suggesting
that
whichever
way
you
now
look
at
shelley
and
kraemer,
unless
you're
prepared
to
overrule
shelley
and
kraemer,
today,
you
want
to
look
at
it
that
its
reasoning
was
correct
that
there
was
a
right
of
discrimination
but
it
couldn't
be
enforced,
this
applies
here.
but,
i
am
suggesting
that
there
is
a
better
part,
that
there
is
another
and
likely
better
view
of
shelley
and
kraemer
that
there
wasn't
any
right
in
the
first
place,
because
the
fourteenth
amendment
forbids
the
state
in
its
action
to
create
or
recognize
that
restrictive
covenant
as
valid
even
between
the
parties.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
what
shelley
and
kraemer
has
generally
been
interpreted
to
do,
and
that's
the--
that
is
the
hornbook
interpretation
of
shelley
and
kraemer.
i
was
suggesting
another
interpretation
of
shelley
and
kraemer.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and,
that
is,
i
take
it,
the
interpretation
that
has
been
given
to
shelley
and
kraemer
is
that
there
was
a
right
to
discriminate
but
that
the
state
couldn't
assist
that
and
i'm
suggesting--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
i
do,
under
the
second
argument
of
the--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
suggest
that
the
right
there
that
the
state
cannot
recognize
is
the
right
to
refuse
to
deal
with
people
solely
because
of
their
color.
and
i'm
suggesting
that
the
state
may
not
either
create
or
recognize
that
right
and
that,
basically,
shelley
and
kraemer
makes
more
logic
under
such
an
interpretation
than
it
does
under
the
more
customary
interpretation.
nevertheless--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
not
anybody
who
wants
to
enter.
anybody
who
wants
to
enter
and
solely--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
kept
out
because
of
his
race--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
man
has
every
right
in
this
world,
every
right
to
make
his
choice
on
bowties
or
anything
or
regular
ties
or
he
can
choose
the
ma--
his
customers
anyway
he
wants
but
there
is
one
thing,
and
this
eloquent
language
of
this
court
in
strauder
makes
it
so
clear,
there
is
just
one
thing
this
court
will
not
recognize
which
are
rights
of
discrimination
because
of
race.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
we
did
go,
your
honor.
we
did
go
to
the
maryland
courts
and
that
case
was
finally
thrown
out
we--
after
the
place
opened
up
sometime
later,
but
i
believe
there
is
such
a
right
and
maybe
i'll
be--
i
want
to
make
one
thing
clear.
maybe
i'll
be
back
with
some
of
these
horrendous
cases
that
have
been
suggested
here,
but
i
don't
have
them
today.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
under
the
second
argument--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
you
have
some
of
these
points,
but
i
don't
have
the
church
today.
i
don't
have
the
home.
i
have
the
biggest
place
of
public
accommodation
probably
in
this
whole
big
metropolitan
area
where
thousands
of
people
are
attracted
daily
and,
of
course,
that
supports
the
size
and
the
place
and
the
licensing
and
the
regulation
and
the
support
of
this
place
by
the
government
all
adds
to
it
and,
as
mr.
justice
douglas
made
clear
his
position
on
a
restaurant
in
a
concurring
opinion,
that
are
licensed
restaurant,
here,
you
have
1,000
times
licensed
place.
it's
licensed
in
every
respect,
regulated
in
every
respect,
supported
in
many
respects.
in
other
words,
their
state
involvement
here,
in
addition
to
recognizing
and
creating
this
right--
this
alleged
right
of
discrimination,
i
see
my
light
is
on.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
again,
i'm
fortunate
that
i
haven't
brought--
i'm
not
here
with
that
case,
but
the
logic,
i
would
say--
i
would
say
that
there
is
no
necessary
reason
for
saying
that
that
is
the
same
case
as
raised,
because
the
point
i
would
like
to
make
clear
is
this
court's
nontolerance
of
any
racial
classification.
this
court
has
upheld
classification
after
classification,
but
there
has
just
been
one
classification
that's
been
inept
to
this
court
and,
as
the
strauder
case
has
said
it
more
eloquently
than
i
can,
there,
the
situation
simply
was
we
will
not
recognize
classifications
based
on
color.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
as
i
was
trying
to
suggest,
your
honor,
i
think
i'm
loaded
with
state
action
when
you
take
the
criminal
conviction
of
the
policeman
and--
but
even
here
where
you
have
a
right
of
discrimination,
if
there
is
a
right
of
discrimination
in
the
private
party,
it
didn't
come
out
of
the
air.
as
this
court
made
clear
in
erie
and--
against
tompkins,
law
doesn't
come
out
of
the
air.
it
came
from
the
state
by
either
its
adoption
of
the
common
law
or
its
adoption
of
the
statute
and--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
if
your
honor--
i
most
respectfully
suggest,
i
find
state
action
in
creating
law
which
recognizes
discrimination
as
much
as
any
other
type
of
state
action.
i
didn't--
i
was
not
trying
to
make
a
roundabout
way
of
saying
state
action
isn't
required
because
this
--
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
say
“no
state
shall”
and
i
wouldn't
want
to
be
put
in
a
position
of
say--
of
trying
to
say
those
words
were
in
there.
what
i
do
say
is
that
state
action
can
be
found
in
the
creation
or
recognition
of
a
private
right
of
discrimin--
of
racial
discrimination
because
that
right
would
not
exist
but
for
the
action
of
the
state
in
the
adoption
of
its
common
law
or
statutory
law.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
30,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
that--
it
wouldn't
quite
be
true.
statutes
do
more
than
recognized
rights.
they
carry--
they
have
methods
of
implementation.
for
example,
most
of
these
statutes
you
can
get
damages
under,
they're
in--
provide
for
injunctions
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state.
you
might've
asked
me
whether
i
thought
the
same.
it
was
unnecessary
to
pass
upon
the
accommodation
statute
in
congress
today
because
the
same
question
would
arise.
my
answer
is
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
to
declare
the
right
because
the
right
would
be
there
but,
certainly,
the
administration
of
that
right,
it
would
be
well
to
have
it
spelled
out,
how
you
administer
it,
who's
going
to
bring
the
suits,
whether
it's
for
damages,
whether
it's
criminal,
all
of
these
other
things
can
be
spelled
out
by
statute.
i'd
say
those
statutes
are
all
quite
necessary
even
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
the
second
climb
of
argument
which,
i
have
tried
to
make
it
clear,
is
not
necessary
because
there
is
so
much
state
action
in
the
first
line.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
it's
an
abolition
of
slavery
and--
but
i
guess
i
thought
i
had
gone
far
out
enough
with
my
suggestion
but
i
do
feel
that
i
could
but--
i
would
have
done
well
to
buttress
with
the
argument
you
suggest.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
i
would've
utilized
that
argument
if
i
had
thought
of
it.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think,
even
under
the
first
argument,
the
courts
may
not
recognize
the
right
of
--
the
private
right
of
discrimination,
as
in
shelley
and
kraemer,
the
court
was
not
allowed
to
recognize
the
private
right
of
discrimination.
and,
under
barrows,
your
case
is
really
closer,
if
i
may
suggest,
to
barrows
than
it
is
to
shelley
against
kramer
because,
in
barrows,
they
said
that
--
this
court
said
that
the
courts
of
the
state
could
not
give
damages,
couldn't
recognize
this
right
to
discriminate
for
damages
that
i
am
suggesting,
they
couldn't
recognize
it
as
a
defense
to
a
suit
for
assault
and
battery.
but,
i
would
like
to
make
this
one
other
point
about
the
self-help,
if
i
might,
mr.
justice
black,
and
that's
that
there
hasn't
been
self-help.
what
has
kept
segregation
alive
in
america
today
has
been
the
state
enforcement
of
private
discrimination.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but
it's
going
on
everyday
and--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
and
i'm
only
suggesting
that
once
this
court
makes
clear
that
there'll
be
no
police
support
to
a
refusal
to
serve,
there'll
be
no
dirty
business
of
self-help.
that
the
proprietors
do
not
engage
in
this
dirty
business
of--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
believe,
if
your
honor
please,
that
a
home
has
other
constitutional
guarantees
which
conflict
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
right
of
a
homeowner
which,
i
take
it,
goes
back
to
english
common
law--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
that
a
homeowner's--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
the
fourth,
the
second
and
fourth
amendments
certainly
indicate
that
the
whole
doctrine
that
the
right
of
a--
that
the
right
of
a
man
to
treat
his
home
as
his
castle
is
a
right
which
is
protected
by
our
constitution
against
search
and
seizure
and
other
--
for
other
infringements,
and
i
would
suggest
that--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
am
suggesting
that
a--
that
there
is
a
homeowner's
right
of
privacy,
which
comes
down
through
the
british
common
law
which
has
never
been
challenged
in
the
united
states
and
that
the
mistake
that
has
been
made
in
this
case
was
eloquently
made
by
the
trial
court,
on
page
74
of
the
record,
when
he
said
"this
court
will
follow
the
law
that
has
already
been
adopted
by
it
that
a
man's
property
is
his
castle."
i
respectfully
suggest
that
there
couldn't
have
been
a
more
eloquent
mistake
than
that.
it
is
not
a
man's
property
that's
his
castle.
it's
a
man's
home.
and,
when
you
go
beyond
his
home,
into
a
place
of
public
accommodation,
all
reasons
for
treating
one's
home
as
a
castle
are
gone,
namely,
your
right
of
privacy
in
your
own
dwellings
and
i--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i'd
say
that
it
is
implicit
in
the
fourth
amendment
but,
to
my
mind,
the
right
of
a--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
but
there
are
different--
it
protects
everything
against
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
but
there
are
differences
in
the
way
the
legal
system
treats
a
home
from
the
way
it
treats--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
other
things.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
and,
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
see--
make
two
suggestions
to
your
honor.
in
first
place,
shelley
and
kraemer
is
not
a
perpetuity
right.
i
think
it's
a
very
limited
number
of
years--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
for
which
they--
they
limit
the
property,
but
secondly,
i
would
say
that
the
law
has
always
recognized
that
property
right
of
the
man
to
join
with
his
neighbors,
not
to
allow
people
to
come
in
he
didn't
like,
and
that
right
was
only
thrown
out
for
one
reason,
the
fourteenth
amendment
said
that
the
states
cannot
enforce
that
right.
and,
i'm
suggesting
here
in
the
second
point
that
not--
that
a
better
way
to
say
it
than
that
the
states
can't
enforce
an
existing
right
is
that
the
states
can't
create
or
recognize
that
right.
but,
whichever
way
you
put
it,
it
seems
to
me,
to
distinguish
shelley
and
kraemer
from
the
sit-in
cases
is,
in
effect,
to
say
that
shelley
and
kraemer
no
longer
exists
beyond
the--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
private
clubs,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
carpool
in
every--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
if
he
opens
it
to
all
of
the
public,
i'd
say,
he
may
not
exclude
that
part
of
the
color--
of
the
public
which
is
colored,
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
that's
exactly
the
intention
of--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that's
exactly
the
intention
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that
is
the
one
thing
he
may
not
do.
he
may
not
open
it
to
the
public
except
negroes.
that
seems
to
me--
that
one
distinction,
he
may
open
it
to
catholics
if
he
just--
if
it's
a
church.
he
may--
you
may
in
your
own--
in
all--
there
may
be
all
sorts
of
reasonable
distinctions,
but
the
one
thing
this
court
has
made
clear
over
and
over
again,
there's
one
unreasonable
distinction
per
se,
race.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
court--
yes,
your
honor,
i--
precisely.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
i
tried
to
be
very
careful
never
to
use
the
words
“irrespective
of
state
action.”
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
have
found
the
state
action.
it
may
not
be--
i
had
thought
it
would
be
adequate
but
i
am
not
suggesting
anything
irrespective
of
state
action.
my
point
is
that
the
private
right
of
discrimination,
if
there
is
such,
must
come
from
the
statutory
or
common
law
of
a
state,
and
that
is
your
state
action.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
but
our
conviction,
i
still
think--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes.
you're
correct,
your
honor,
and
without
any
difficulty.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
there
was
the
compulsion
of
a--
of
the
picket
line,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
they
desegregated
before
there
was
a
legal
compulsion
but
the
legal
compulsion
now
exists.
there
is
a
montgomery
county--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
persuasive,
your
honor,
as
the--
as
an
old
picket
line
fellow
myself.
thank
you.
[laughter]
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
can
i
just
have
10
seconds?
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
believe
my
colleagues
pointed
out
that
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
me
whether
my
second
point
would
require
the
overruling
of
the
civil
rights
cases.
the
answer
in
our
judgment
is
that
it
does
not
require
the
overruling
of
the
civil
right
cases
because
the
assumption
was
made
at
that
time
that
the
states
would
deal
with
this
problem.
this
is
briefed
at
page
29
of
the
brief.
