justice
john
m.
harlan
could
he
do
that,
they
are
definitive
orders
from
his
employer?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
are
differences
in
this
case,
i
take
it
before
he
took
the
act
in
this
particular
case,
he
consulted
with
his
employer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
case
that
this
was
an
exception
to
the
general
deputy
conduct,
that
he
ever
acted
without
specific
orders
of
his
employers?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
would
be
undeputized
police
officer,
in
every
practical
sense,
occupy
that
dual
relationship?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
undeputized
police
officer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
ordinary
police.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
difference
is
there
in
craft?
what
difference
is
there
in
the
practical
relationship
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
between
the
man
and
the
other
man?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
based
on
analysis,
if
the
ordinary
police
officer
was
unable
to
persuade
the
land
owner
to
settle
the
case
because
to
put
it
would
be
duty
to
arrest,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
there
was
a
clear
violation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice.
i
thought
you
said
first
power
arrest
in
this
case
stemming
from
his
authority
as
deputy
sheriff.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
supposing
this
man
had
been
properly
deputized,
supposing
he
simply
been
a
detective,
a
private
detective,
could
he
have
arrested
this
man
--
this
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
he
have
made
this
arrest
with
the
request
of
the
owner?
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
court
--
your
state
court
seems
to
have
made
otherwise.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
whether
embarrassing
to
you
or
not,
what's
the
maryland
law?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
the
court
in
its
affirmation
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
wasn't
there
an
intervening
episode?
before
he
arrested
them,
he
consulted
with
the
park
owners
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
only
so
far
at
least
in
the
realm
of
state
action.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
just
a
roundabout
way
of
saying
that
the
state
action
isn't
required.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
court
has
never
announced
any
such
broad
suite
of
doctrine
that
you're
suggesting,
that
irrespective
of
state
action,
race
is
the
one
thing
that's
taboo.
we've
never
said
anything
like
that
or
ever
approaching
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
then--
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
right
in
thinking
that,
since
this
conviction
took
place,
the
owner
has
changed
his
policy
and
now
the
facilities--
the
park
is
desegregated?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
or
without
any
compulsion
either.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
understand
that,
without
any
legal
compulsion.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
there's
really
no
difference
between
you
and
mr.
rauh
on
the
premise
of
would
this
case
must
be
argued
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
state
action.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
he
doesn't
argue
with
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
that
doesn't
involve
state
action.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
owner,
in
this
particular
instance,
say
“(inaudible)
here
to
my
segregation
policy,
but
i
like
to
go
and
see
this
go
on.
i
don't
want
you
to
arrest
them.”
would
the
officer
have
been
obligated
notwithstanding
that--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
to
arrest
them?
