any
license
to
that
effect?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
not
everyday
though,
is
it?
i
don't
mean
the
collusion
part,
but
the
regular
business
is,
isn't
it
true,
protecting
like
a
night
watchman
and
things
of
that
kind?
the
state,
under
deputy
--
the
sheriff
locally
will
deputize
a
man
in
an
instance
of
an
employer
or
in
the
interest
of
an
agency?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
you
say
there's
no
significance
between
that
and
that
they
did
not
deputize
him?
justice
tom
c.
clark
why
do
they
do
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he'll
do
it
in
order
to
have
some
dignity
of
the
law
to
hire
that
particular
person
live
up
to
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
concede
though
that
he
was
acting
out
instructions
of
the
management.
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
just
go
to
the
parking
area,
do
they
not?
justice
tom
c.
clark
as
i
remember,
i
took
my
grandchildren
out
there
several
times.
the
roads
do
go
to
a
parking
area
where
you
park
your
car
and
then
you
walk
from
there
to
the
park.
justice
tom
c.
clark
he
knew
the
police
of
the
park.
justice
tom
c.
clark
before
he
discussed
it
with
the
owner,
he
told
the
people
to
leave
in
five
minutes,
is
that
right?
is
that
the
chronology?
justice
tom
c.
clark
when
did
the
officer
approach
the
owner?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
before
the
officer
approached
to
these
petitioners?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
then
he
returned
and
told
them
to
leave
in
five
minutes?
justice
tom
c.
clark
which
was
the
instruction
of
the
owner.
