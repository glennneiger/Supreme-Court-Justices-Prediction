they
needed
tickets
for
that,
didn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
they
had
them.
justice
potter
stewart
you
call
him
lieutenant
collins.
what
was
he
a
lieutenant
in?
justice
potter
stewart
just
so
i
can
get
your
second
point.
when
you
talk
about
discrimination,
are
you
limiting
it
to
racial
discrimination?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
talking
about
a
person's
right
to
be
discriminating.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
racial
discrimination.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rauh,
isn't
it
accurate
to
say
that
what
was
vindicated
in
shelley
against
kraemer
was
the
right
of
the
owner
of
property
to
alienate
it,
deal
with
it
as
he
wished
in
defiance
of
a
racially
restrictive
covenant
and
what
is
involved
here
on
the
part
of
your
opponent,
as
it
is
asserted,
is
the
right
of
the
owner
of
property
to
deal
with
it
if
he
wishes?
justice
potter
stewart
who
were
the
--
who
were
the
parties
in
shelley
against
kraemer?
who
was
shelley
and
who
were
--
who
was
kraemer?
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
but
the
negro
buyer
was
not
a
party
in
shelley
against
kraemer,
was
he?
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
seller?
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
the
seller
a
party,
the
landowner?
justice
potter
stewart
against
the
buyer.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
have
to
have
that
into
maryland.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
follow
under
your
second
argument
then,
mr.
rauh,
would
it
not,
that
if
there's
no
right
on
the
part
of
the
owner
of
glen
echo
to
discriminate,
then
there
is
a
correlative
privilege
on
the
part
of
anybody
who
wants
to
enter
to
get
state
enforcement
of
his
right
to
enter?
justice
potter
stewart
who
was
discriminated
against
because
of
his
race?
justice
potter
stewart
not
for
a--
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
would
have
followed
that
these
petitioners
could
have
gone,
and
probably
should
have
gone,
to
the
maryland
courts
and
brought
an
injunction
action
against
maryland.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
do
have
that
under
your
second
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rauh,
just
please
sit
down
and,
confining
ourselves
to
your--
this--
your
second
argument.
i
am
correct,
am
i
not,
in
my
understanding
that
great
many
states
have
statutes
forbidding
racial
discrimination
in
places
such
as
glen
echo?
justice
potter
stewart
30.
now,
under
your
second
argument,
all
those
statutes
are
entirely
redundant,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
the
basic
question.
here,
he
didn't
open
it
to
all
the
public.
he
opened
it
to
all
the
public
except
negroes.
justice
potter
stewart
what
have
they
got
to
do
with
this
case
since
they're
complicated
enough
on
their
own?
[laughter]
i
don't--
i
honestly
don't
understand
what
(inaudible)
--
justice
potter
stewart
those
were
equal
protection
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
those
cases
arose
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
with
all
respect
to
my
colloquy,
a
state
action,
that's
not
the
point.
obviously,
this
is
a
state
action.
this
was
a
state
conviction.
it's
not
state
action
that
decides
whether
or
not
this
is
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
whether
or
not
there
was
state
discrimination.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
always
state
action
every
time
there
is
a
conviction
in
a
state
court.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
state
denial
of
rights
under
this.
