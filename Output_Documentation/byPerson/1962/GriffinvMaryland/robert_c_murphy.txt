mr.
robert
c.
murphy
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
in
maryland
no
law,
there's
no
governmental
policy,
there's
no
state
or
locally
induced
custom
which
requires
exclusion
of
negros
from
amusement
parks,
places
of
amusement
or
for
that
matter,
any
other
type
of
private
business
in
maryland.
i
certainly
agree
with
my
brother
that
the
state
of
maryland,
in
this
respect,
does
not
differ
from
the
state
of
montana,
from
the
state
of
michigan.
the
racially
discriminatory
practice
of
the
amusement
park
was
not,
therefore,
in
this
case,
caused
by
or
the
result
of
any
state
policy
or
law.
i
think
the
record
is
plainly
devoid
of
any
showing
that
the
policy
of
the
park
excluding
negros
was
in
any
way
influenced,
aided,
promoted,
or
in
any
way
assisted
by
any
state
law
or
any
state
policy
by
any
locally
induced
custom.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
don't
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
on
the
basis
of
the
existing
law
as
they
saw.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
think,
on
the
contrary,
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
the
park
management,
for
51
years,
had
been
practicing
discrimination
on
racial
line.
this
was
a
close
family
held
corporation.
there
are
only
three
members
in
the
family
that
owned
it
at
the
time
of
this
act
of
discrimination,
but
they
had,
for
51
years,
excluded
negros
as
a
matter
of
business
of
choice.
now,
the
fact
that
there
was
no
governmental
restraint
involved
here
or
governmental
action
that
would
induce
them
to
have
such
an
exclusionary
policy.
i
think
it's
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
and
is
conceded
by
my
brother
that
shortly
after
the
conclusion
of
these
cases
in
the
lower
court,
the
park
abandoned
its
policy.
so
that,
the
park
now
is
fully
integrated
and,
shortly
after
that,
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
montgomery
county
enacted
an
equal
accommodations
bill,
effective
january
of
1962,
but
i
think
the
element
of
state
action,
the
state
policy,
state
law
is
apparently
absent
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i'm
saving
that
to
the
end.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i'm
saving
that,
sir,
if
i
can.
i'll
get
there.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i'm
tying
it
in
some
order
which
makes
sense
to
me
to
get
to
these
points
perhaps
which
are
more
difficult.
i
like
to
pass
the
easy
ones
perhaps
in
the
beginning.
now,
the
state
of
maryland
has
no
profound
thoughts
on
the
existing
law
which
gives
the
right,
common
law
right
to
a
private
entrepreneur
such
as
an
amusement
park
to
arbitrarily
discriminate
as
to
its
invitees.
we
simply
cite
the
existing
law
to
you.
we
rely
strongly
on
the
howard
johnson's
case
of
the
fourth
circuit.
there's
also
i
think
some
semi-implicit
recognition
of
the
validity
of
these
common
law
concepts
and
both
important,
and
the
burton
versus
wilmington
park
authority
cases.
the
requirement
of
a
license
to
operate,
as
is
present
in
this
case,
from
a
montgomery
county
with
relation
to
amusement
parks
does
not
matter
to
convert
this
facility,
which
is
private,
into
a
public
facility.
i
have
difficulty
seeing
how
any
facility
open
to
the
public
is
not
affected
with
public
interest.
i
don't
know
where
you
would
draw
the
line
if
mere
licensure
was
tantamount
to
a
--
to
taking
away
from
the
private
entrepreneur
of
his
common
law
right
of
free
choice.
certainly,
there's
no
franchise
or
monopoly
granted
by
the
mere
grant
of
a
license.
frequently,
they're
solely
for
revenue
purposes.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
certainly,
they
--
under
the
common
law,
they
cannot
differentiate
or
discriminate.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
against
negros
or
anyone
else.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir,
but
it
was
sanctioned.
it
was
in
the
common
law
part
of
our
constitution.
sir,
i
think
that
is
a
distinction.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
age
on
its
side.
we
would,
therefore,
adopt
the
entire
statement
of
justice
soper
in
the
fourth
circuit
in
williams
versus
harold
johnson
that
the
license
laws
do
not
fill
the
void
that
we
are
speaking
of
now.
now,
my
brothers
assert
that
even
absence
of
a
law,
state
law,
or
state
policy
requiring
the
exclusion
of
negros
in
the
private
amusement
park
that,
nevertheless,
the
mere
act
of
arrest
and
a
conviction
is
a
violation
of
equal
protection.
they
rely
strongly
on
shelley
versus
kraemer.
one
distinction
that
i
see
very
clearly
between
this
case
and
shelley
is
that,
in
shelley,
we
had
--
we're
dealing
with
a
constitutionally
protected
right.
there,
we
had
a
willing
buyer
and
a
willing
seller
in
a
completed
contract.
on
the
other
hand,
here,
we
do
not
have
--
we
only
have
one
willing
party.
the
other
is
totally
unwilling.
he
seeks
to
assert
his
right
of
private
choice.
the
common
law
gives
him
that
right.
it
gives
--
the
constitution
does
not
give
the
petitioners
in
this
case
any
constitutional
right
to
go
on
private
property
against
the
will
of
the
owner
to
make
the
contract.
i
think
there
is
a
basic
distinction
between
this
and
shelley.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
no,
sir,
not
to
my
understanding.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
think
it
was
simply
understood
because
of
the
long
practice
of
the
parks
in
51
years
of
fostering
segregation.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
probably
not,
in
the
ultimate
result,
if
the
private
property
owner
did
not
want
them
there
and
asked
them
to
leave.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
simply
entering,
no.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
we
feel
in
the
case
of
griffin
versus
collins,
which
is
a
civil
side
of
this
particular
case
that
we
have
before
the
court
now,
chief
justice
thompson
had
the
same
question
that
is
now
being
raised
and
i'd
like
to
quote
very
briefly
from
his
opinion.
he
said
“simply
granted
the
right
of
the
proprietor
to
choose
his
customers
and
to
eject
trespassers,
it
can
hardly
be
the
law,
as
plaintiffs
contend,
that
the
proprietor
may
use
such
force
as
he
and
his
employees
possess
but
may
not
call
on
a
peace
officer
to
enforce
his
rights.
we
subscribe
to
that.
we
think
that
all
has
been
done
here
and
i'm
borrowing
now
from
the
government's
amicus
curiae
brief,
we
simply
recognize,
and
given
scope
to
this
concept,
that
in
a
civilized
community
where
legal
remedies
have
been
substituted
for
force,
private
choice
necessarily
depends
upon
the
support
of
sovereign
sanctions.
the
action
of
the
state
here
is
entirely
neutral.
there's
no
policy.
there's
no
custom.
there's
no
law
that
requires
segregation.
their
action
has
been
entirely
neutral.
now,
against
this
background
of
no
law,
no
policy,
no
custom,
we
come
to
the
question,
i
think,
the
heart
of
the
matter
is
the
role
played
in
this
by
deputy
sheriff
collins,
as
he
is
now
known,
prior
to
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
as
he
is
now
known.
at
one
time,
your
honor,
the
only
one
that
knew
he
was
a
deputy
sheriff
was
himself
and
that,
in
the
case
below,
the
fact
of
his
holding
a
special
deputy
sheriff's
commission
was
volunteered
by
him
and
that
appears
at
r14
of
the
record.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
he
was
a
deputy
sheriff
and
he
did
go
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
perhaps
i
should
rephrase
that.
it
was
important
in
anyone's
mind
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
that
may
have
appeared
important
at
the
lower
court
trial
to
someone
but
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
the
record
does
not
say
what
it
says,
but
i
did
find
out,
your
honor,
that
the
badge
says
“special
deputy
sheriff
montgomery
county,”
and
it's
a
rather
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
the
record
doesn't
show.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
the
record
simply
says
that
i
was
wearing
a
badge.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
he
volunteered
in
his
testimony
that
he
was
a
special
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
after
he
told
people
he
was
a
special
deputy
sheriff,
yes.
prior
to
that
time,
it
is
true
that
when
he
arrested
and
took
the
petitioners
to
the
police
station,
a
warrant
was
filled
out
in
which
his
capacity
as
a
special
deputy
sheriff
was
indicated.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
there's
no
evidence
that
he
had
it
on
the
outside
of
his
shirt.
we
can
presume
that.
there's
no
evidence
what
the
badge
was.
i
think
we
could
concede
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
that
he
had
a
badge.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir,
but
it's
not
in
the
record.
i'm
not
now
arguing
that
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
he
had
a
tin
badge
that
he,
himself,
bought
from
some
place.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
said
i'm
not
now
arguing
that
he
had
some
badge
that
he
himself
may
have
bought
or
conjured
up
and
put
on
himself
without
authority.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
perhaps
i'm
getting
neither
ahead
of
myself
or
behind
myself.
i
--
in
the
beginning
of
this
trial,
this
mr.
collins
--
francis
collins
was
known
and
throughout
the
trial,
as
the
transcript
will
indicate,
he
was
always
lieutenant
collins.
now,
lieutenant
collins
was
a
lieutenant
in
the
national
detective
agency
which
was
a
private
detective
agency
and,
under
the
laws
of
maryland,
they
have
absolutely
no
police
power,
no
more
than
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
that's
right.
very
–
[laughter]
very
frequently,
these
gentlemen
fashioned
themselves
as
police
officers,
while
they're
not.
now,
it
may
well
have
been,
and
the
record
does
not
show
this
either,
upon
whose
application
mr.
collins
was
deputized.
now,
it
seems
to
be
assumed
that
he
was
deputized
upon
the
application
of
a
park
because
he
was
a
deputy
sheriff
in
and
for
the
park.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
the
basic
distinction
here
is
that
the
government
and
the
petitioners
are
trying
to
conjure
up
some
picture
of
the
state
of
maryland
colluding
with
the
park.
here
is
the
authority
of
the
state
of
maryland
to
perpetuate
a
racially
discriminative
policy.
this
is
not
true.
the
words
are
used,
i
think,
in
the
government's
brief,
amicus
curiae
that
the
state
of
maryland
prostituted
its
police
power
to
the
private
purposes
of
the
park.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
is
this
truly
state
action?
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
would
that
truly
be
state
action?
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
would
that
be,
in
the
words
of
the
wilmington
park
case,
state
action
to
some
significant
extent?
would
it
be
significant?
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
in
this
case,
your
honor,
he
did
not
say
that
until
after
he
consulted
with
the
park
management.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
it
might
make
a
difference.
i
think
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
it
may
seem
in
the
same
position
as
any
other
police
officer
and
the
result
--
the
ultimate
result
of
what
occurred.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
did
not
take
it
on
any
importance
until
we're
at
the
appellate
level.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
very
frequently
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
very
frequently,
a
gentleman
who
has
a
uniform
on,
such
as
lieutenant
collins
had,
he
was
known
to
be
a
private
detective
in
the
minds
of
many
people,
including
police
officers,
they
are
thought
to
be
a
police
officer.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
including
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
it
isn't
clear
that
he
moved
to
dismiss
on
that
precise
ground.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
perhaps
--
again,
and
this
is
perhaps
speculative
on
my
part,
he
was
--
the
private
detective
many
he
sought
to
be
a
state
officer.
they
are
licensed
to
go
into
this
business
and
thought
by
many
to
be
a
state
officer.
i
can
conjure
up
a
scene
when
these
petitioners
were
taken
to
the
police
station
of
a
warrant
being
handed
to
mr.
collins
and
he
just
merely
completed
it,
but
even
if
he
was
and
i
think
if
we
concede
that
he
was
a
deputy
sheriff
and
that
it
was
important
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
and
was
wearing
a
badge
of
his
office,
that
he
did
ask
his
employer
what
he
should
do
and
was
told
to
tell
them
the
policy
of
the
park
and
if
they
did
not
leave
within
a
reasonable
time,
to
arrest
them.
it's
precisely
what
he
did.
he
--
i
think
he
finally
acted
no
differently
than
any
other
police
officer
who
call
--
was
called
in
the
scene
and
perhaps
he
was
already
on
the
scene.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
that's
the
difference
between
chalk
and
cheese.
as
a
private
detective,
he
had
no
police
power.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
as
a
private
detective,
he
had
no
police
power
whatsoever.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
as
a
special
deputy
sheriff,
he
possessed
the
power
of
a
deputy
sheriff
who
in
turn
has
the
powers
of
a
sheriff
which
are
common
law
powers
of
being
a
conservator
of
the
peace,
full
powers
of
arrest
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
on
the
premises.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
a
major
difference.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
he
could
not
have
arrested
and
perhaps
this
is
significant
because
he
did
not
act
as
a
police
officer.
if
he
was
acting
as
a
police
officer,
a
warrant
would
have
been
totally
unnecessary.
this
was
a
misdemeanor
committed
in
his
presence.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
he
arrested
him
first.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
think
we're
using
that
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
if
we
use
the
word
“arrest”
in
its
common
connotation,
he
withheld
--
were
restrained
of
their
liberty.
they
were
very
happy
that
this
occurred
because
that's
precisely
why
they
came
to
the
park,
to
get
arrested,
but
he
went,
as
any
other
private
citizen,
and
had
a
warrant
sworn
out.
our
court
of
appeals
took
the
position
in
effect
that
he
was
exercising
no
state
authority
that
--
or
if
he
was
exercising
state
authority,
this
did
not
detract
from
his
role
as
an
agent
of
the
park.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
it
did.
however,
he
did
not
exercise
it
in
the
traditional
sense.
if
a
misdemeanor
is
committed
in
an
officer's
presence,
he
arrests
and
very
seldom,
if
ever,
gets
a
warrant.
in
this
case
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
it
would
have
been
an
un
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
not
under
maryland
law,
the
arrest
would
not
have
been
valid
because
there
was
no
breach
of
the
peace
involved
in
this.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
that's
a
matter
of
some
embarrassment
to
me.[laughter]
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
the
maryland
law,
i
think,
is
as
is
stated
in
our
brief.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
unless
the
court
of
appeals
had
this
in
mind
that
a
breach
of
the
peace
was
eminent
because
there
is
some
evidence
that
there
was
a
milling
crowd
because
of
this
breach
of
the
peace,
this
threatened
breach
of
the
peace,
then
the
private
citizen
had
the
power
of
arrest.
now,
i
don't
know
but
if
we
take
out
totally
this
idea
of
an
eminent
breach
of
peace,
i
think
the
law
is
as
stated
in
our
brief.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
certainly
from
a
legal
standpoint,
he
arrested
them.
he
might,
in
his
own
mind
and
in
the
park's
mind,
felt
that
there
was
no
arrest,
but
as
you
and
i
know
it,
there
was
restraint
of
the
liberty
of
the
petitioners
and
henceforth
an
arrest.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
he
did
say
that.
private
detectives
are
forever
arresting
someone,
but
they
have
no
authority
to
arrest.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
no,
sir,
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
saying
that
an
arrest
undoubtedly
took
place
at
the
time
that
lieutenant
collins
took
these
petitioners
under
his
wing
or
under
his
charge,
but
whether
the
arrest
was
lawful
or
unlawful
at
that
point,
he
did
get
a
warrant
which
indicates
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
think
he
would
have
had
to
do
that.
i
think
the
fact
that
he
went
and
got
a
warrant
indicated,
at
least
in
his
own
mind,
that
he
was
not
arresting
as
a
police
officer.
now,
the
fact
that
the
warrant
say
that
he
was
special
deputy
sheriff
collins,
we
don't
know
who
completed
those
warrants.
it
could
have
been
an
individual
who
knew
him
as
such,
but
you
can't
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
perhaps.
[laughter]
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
june
30,
1960.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
think
the
same
night.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
same
night.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
think
it
was
august
4.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
they
prayed
a
jury
trial,
i
understand.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
they
prayed
a
jury
trial.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
ordinarily,
these
cases
are
tried
at
the
magistrate
level,
but
you
can
pray
a
jury
trial
that
was
done
--
as
was
done
here,
was
tried
in
the
circuit
court,
hence,
this
delay
in
trial.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
no,
i
think
they
did.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
would
like
to
point
out
also
that
--
some
suggestion
that
the
park
paid
officer
collins,
that
is
not
true.
officer
collins
was
not
in
the
employ
of
the
park
in
any
traditional
sense.
he
was
employed
in
national
detective
agency.
his
loyalty
was
to
the
national
detective
agency.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
think
he
did,
but
he
owed
his
employer's
duty
to
the
park
management.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir,
but
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
the
suggestion
here,
again,
is
made
that
this
is
some
sort
of
an
alliance
between
collins
and
the
park
to
perpetuate
the
park's
policy
that
he
was
like
a
robot.
he
did
precisely
what
the
park
told
him
because
he
was
paid
by
the
park.
he
could
not
exercise
any
independent
judgment.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
no,
sir,
i
do
not,
i'm
saying
that
he
was
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
was
hired
for
any
reason
other
than
the
normal
reason
that
you
hire
an
agency
for
the
protection
of
the
park
to
maintain
the
peace
and
good
order
on
the
premises.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
i
say
that,
on
the
evidence
before
the
court,
it
could
and
was
concluded
by
our
own
court
of
appeals
that
he
was
exercising
no
state
authority.
he
had
it,
but
he
didn't
exercise
it
in
this
particular
situation.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
i
think
that
anyone
can
make
an
unlawful
arrest.
the
simple
fact
that
he
said
“i
arrest
you”
does
not
indicate,
at
least
to
me,
that
he
means
that
he
is
arresting
in
his
public
capacity.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
i
think
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
not
entirely,
i
think
not.
i
think
that
the
ultimate
issue
here
is,
was
there
any
state
action
involved
which,
to
some
significant
extent,
supports
a
private
policy
of
racial
discrimination.
i
could
very
well
see,
your
honor,
if
we
had
some
collusive
arrangement
between
the
state
of
maryland
using
special
deputy
sheriffs,
appointed
upon
the
application,
and
an
employee
of
a
private
entrepreneur
who
wants
to
practice
racial
discrimination
an
very
unholy
alliance.
but,
these
facts
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
that
is
certainly
true.
well,
we
have
a
state
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
no,
i
think
there
is
significance.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
i
think
that's
a
question
as
to
who
did
it
here.
it's
another
problem.
was
it
done
by
the
park
or
was
it
done
by
officer
collins
in
his
own
individual
capacity
so
that
he
would
be
a
more
effective
individual
on
his
job?
was
it
done
by
his
employer,
the
detective
agency?
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
think
that's
largely
true.
i
might
say
that
the
state
of
maryland
has
a
statewide
act
whereby
the
governor
of
the
state
commissions
special
policemen
for
certain
types
of
corporations
upon
the
application
of
the
corporation,
railroad
corporation,
steamboat,
it's
been
broadened,
recently,
to
include
most
any
type
of
corporation,
mercantile
included.
it
would
not
be
broad
enough
to
encompass
this
type
of
facility.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
think
that's
the
ultimate
effect,
whether
that's
the
purpose
would
be
questionable.
we
feel,
if
your
honors
please,
the
viewing
all
the
circumstances
together
did
not
entirely
clear
that
--
it's
not
clear
at
all
that
officer
collins
--
lieutenant
collins
was
exercising
any
state
authority
and,
even
if
he
was
exercising
state
authority,
i
think
the
ultimate
effect
is
no
different
and
if
a
police
officer
was
called
to
the
scene
and
asked
the
issue
at
the
instance
of
the
private
power
to
arrest,
as
was
done
in
this
particular
case.
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
it
would
the
same
type
--
type
of
state
action
that
would
be
involved
here,
no
greater.
it
might
be
innocent
state
action,
i
don't
know
if
there's
a
distinction
between
innocent
or
knowing
and
unknowing
state
action.
it
would
seem
to
be
when
the
ultimate
result
is
being
considered.
i'd
like
to
just,
finally,
to
point
out
that
the
record
does
indicate
very
strongly
that
officer
collins,
whatever
his
capacity,
acted
in
this
particular
situation
after
conferring
with
the
park
management.
he
was
told
by
the
park
management
that
he
was
to
give
the
petitioners
an
opportunity
to
leave,
which
he
did,
and,
following
their
refusal
to
leave,
he
arrested
them
just
like
any
other
police
officer.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
may
it
please
the
court.
the
trespass
convictions
in
this
case
are
firmly
anchored
to
the
proposition
of
a
private
business
which
operates
in
a
facility
which
is
purely
private,
such
as
the
amusement
park
we
have
in
this
case,
may,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
requires
a
license
from
the
state
in
order
to
operate,
may
nevertheless
exclude
arbitrarily
from
the
premises
such--
its
customers
or
invitees,
that--
and
they
do
so,
if
it
chooses,
on
no
more
rational
or
concrete
basis
than
race,
which
was
done
in
this
case.
we
certainly
concede
that
the
petitioners
in
this
case
were
excluded
from
glen
echo
park
at
that
time
because
they
were
negroes.
we
believe,
your
honors,
that
the
cases
in
both
the
state
and
the
lower
federal
courts
uniformly,
without
exception,
support
the
proposition
to
which
i
have
just
referred
here.
and
we
would
submit
that
this
court
has
recognized
and
perhaps
implicitly,
if
not
expressly,
recognized
the
validity
of
the
proposition
in
such
cases
as
terminal
taxicab,
boynton
versus
virginia,
and
wilmington
parking
authority,
all,
of
course
cited
in
the
state's
brief.
and,
to
argue,
as
petitioners
do
hear
this
morning,
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
the
state
affirmatively
to
prevent
such
discrimination,
as
was
present
in
this
case,
is
really
to
ignore
approximately
100
years
of
consistent
constitutional
interpretation
of
the
amendment
as
being
solely
prohibitive
in
character
upon
the
states.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
the
state,
inaction
--
state
inaction,
perhaps
in
the
reapportionment
cases.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
under
the--
under
i--
are
you
thinking
of
screws,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
that
was
state
in
action
but,
there
you
were
dealing
with
a
statute
which
invested
the
person
discriminated
against
with
a
civil
right
to
sue
in
damages.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
for
state
action
or
something
under
color
of
state
action
which
was
present
in
that
case.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
think,
basically,
it
is
correct,
but
the
principle
or
the
proposition
has
never
been
applied
in
cases
in
the
area
in
which
we
are
now
dealing,
state
inaction.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
basically,
when
you--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
basically,
you
deny
someone
something
by
affirmatively
moving
toward
that
end.
i'd
say
this,
certainly,
that
the
waters
have
been
considerably
muddy
since
the
reapportionment
cases.
there,
we
are
dealing
with
state
inaction,
but
in
this
particular
field,
they--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
state
inaction
on
the
part
of
a
legislature
which
denies
individuals
or
dilutes
their
votes.
they're
failing
to
reapportion
themselves
as
being--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
denial
of
the
process.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
as
these
did.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
in
marsh
against
alabama,
the
state
action,
there,
you--
as
your
honor
knows,
having
been
the
author
of
the
opinion,
they
were
dealing
with
a
municipality
and
the
state
action
in
that
case
was
in
totally
circumscribing
first
amendment
rights,
not
attempting
to
control
them
but
just
saying
“no
one
can
speak
on
my
property
under
the
guides
of
it
being
personal
or
private
property,”
of
course,
it
was
not.
it
was
a
wholly-owned
town
of
a
--
of
a
private
corporation
but,
because
of
its
features
of
course,
was
treated
as
any
other
municipality.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
as
i
recall,
they
totally
circumscribed
the
right
of
anyone
to
distribute
the
religious
literature
in
that
town
of
those
particular
petitioners
in
that
case.
they
said
“you
cannot
do
it.”
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
but
this
court
analogized
the--
that
property
as
being
public
property
because
it
was,
in
essence,
a
municipality
or--
being
privately
owned.
it
was
a
municipality.
it
took
on
all
the
public
features
of
any
other
municipality.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
i
think
the
application
of
the
trespass
statute
in
that
case,
coupled
with
the
total
proscription
against
the
distribution
of
the
legislature,
was
enough.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
it
was
totally
arbitrary
but,
here,
the
company
was
acting
not
in
its
classic
private
sense
but
it,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
town,
in
effect,
exercising
public
power.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
in
a
limited
degree,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
in
baltimore
city,
we
have
a
major
park,
druid
hill
park,
which
has,
i
believe,
a
carousel.
i
could
be
wrong
but
it
certainly
did
at
one
time.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
i
think
it
can.
i
think
it
has
to,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
state
and
the--
and
its
citizens
can
both
engage
in
the
same
type
of
business
at
the
same
time
if
they
choose
to
do
so.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
every
private
function
smacks
of
some
public
character.
this
court
said
that
in
the
terminal
taxicab,
as
i
recall,
that
everything
we
do
has
some
public
aspect
to
it.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
of
degree.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
no,
sir,
not
the
only
one.
certainly,
i
think
that
glen
echo
park
was
probably
near
or
around
an
urban
renewal
development.
certainly,
you
have
highways
leading
into
it
but--
and,
up
to
this
point,
no
court
has
ever
taken
those
particular
incidents
and
said
that
this
made
a
private
business
or
transform
a
private
business
into
a--
into
a
public
function.
it's
all
a
matter
of
degree.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
certainly,
but
not
a
whole
lot
more
than
a
restaurant
or
a
hotel,
i
wouldn't
think.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir,
definitely.
there
is
public
involvement
in
just
about
everything
we
do.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
no,
sir.
your
honor,
it
advertised
generally
for
the
public
and
not--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
it
did
not
delineate
negroes
from
whites.
it
advertised
generally.
all
were
apparently
welcome.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
your
honor,
on
page
11
of
the
record,
something
rather
peculiar,
the
counsel
for
the
state
undertook
to
prove
there
was
eight
signs
on
the
property.
if
you'll--
but,
he
never
quite
got
around
in
proving
it.
he
said
if
you
look
at
that,
your
honor,
for--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
i
don't.
i
think
they
were
there.
[laughter]
i
think
they
were
there
but
certainly,
at
this
juncture,
we
would
have
to
say
that
there
were
no
signs
on
the
property
because
the
evidence
does
not
show
that
there
were.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
your
honor,
there's
a
statement
in
the
record,
which
is
not
in
my
favor,
which
suggests
that
the
policy
of
the
park
was
to
have
its
police
force
at
the
gates
and
to
prevent
negroes
from
coming
in.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
i
think
there
is
a
--
gate
in
a
sense
of
the--
of
a
main
entrance,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
fenced.
there's
a
gate
in
the
sense
of
a
main
entrance
where
people
would
go
in,
but
it's
not
fenced.
but,
in
this
particular
incident
on
this
particular
night,
they
did
not
accost
the
petitioners
until
they
were
on
the
carousel
and,
i
might
add,
a
very
appealing
place
for
being
arrested.
i
don't
know
whether
that
answers
your
question
or
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
we
would
emphasize
your
honors
that
this
court
has
always
interpreted
the
amendment,
i
say
“always”
now
somewhat
qualified,
as
being
a
limitation
upon
the
exercise
of
power
by
a
state
at
the
risk
of
being
somewhat
trite.
i'd
like
to
repeat
very
briefly
some
of
the
court's
own
statements
construing
the
amendment
as
“directing
no
shield
against
merely
private
conduct,
however
discriminatory
or
wrongful.
the
amendment
is
not
a
guarantee
against
the
commission
of
individual
offenses.
it
does
not
add
anything
to
the
rights
of
one
citizen
as
against
another.
that
individual
invasion
of
individual
rights
is
not
the
subject
matter
of
the
amendment.”
in
short,
this
court
has
said,
and
i
think
very
recently,
in
either
peterson
or
greenville,
restated
the
fact
that
the
action
inhibited
by
the
amendment
was
only
such
action
as
made
fairly
be
said
to
be
that
of
the
states.
we
do
not
believe
that
the--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
in
any
of
its
manifestations,
if
it's
some--
in
some
significant
way
involved
in
this
case,
these
convictions
would
have
to
fall
if
you
find
that
true.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
your
honor,
i
am
stuck
with
the
sheriff's--
with
the
deputy
sheriff
in
this
case,
and
i'll
get
to
him
in
due
time,
i
suppose,
but--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
state
action.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
he
argues
shelley
versus
kraemer
as
being
a
cure
to
all
his
problems.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
think
this
is
a
state
action
case.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
it's
--
a
state
action
of
a
particular
type
that
was--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
--
discriminatory
or--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
think
significant
state
involvement
or
significant
state
action--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
we've
attempted
to
distinguish
shelley
versus
kraemer
on
the
ground
that,
in
shelley,
we're
dealing
with
constitutionally
protected
rights,
and
in
the
present
case,
you're
not.
there
is
no
constitutionally
protected
right
to
enter
property
of--
a
private
property
of
another
contrary
to
the
will
of
that
owner.
now,
that
perhaps
is
the
most
basic
distinction
we
can
find.
i
believe
there
are
others.
alienation
on
the--
on
a
fee
would
be
one,
as
been
mentioned
here
by
the
court.
there
are
others,
but
in
the
factual
situation
that
we
have,
this
appears
to
me
to
be
most
direct
and
a
basis
upon
which
shelley
could
be
distinguished
from
the
factual
situation
in
the
present
case.
i
might
also
add
that
in
for--
in
enforcing
the--
a
non-discriminatory
type
of
trespass
statute
as
was
done
in
the
instant
case,
that
the
state
is
simply
recognizing
the
need
in
an
ordered
society
that
private
choice,
if
it's
to
exist,
depends
upon
the
support
of
sovereign
sanctions.
this
is
a
neutral
enforcement.
it
doesn't
induce
others
to
discriminate.
it
also
i
would
feel
affords
the
possibility.
and,
i
say
possibility
rather
than
likely
fact
of
force
and
violence
initiated
by
the
owner.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
mr.
justice
black,
we've
reserved
15
minutes
to
answer
the
solicitor
general
on
that
point.
getting
to
the
crux
of
the
problem,
as
it
has
been
pointed
out,
is
simply
to
ascertain
whether
there
has
been
state
action
of
a
particular
character
which
is--
involves
the
state
with
the
discriminatory
policy
of
the
park.
in
this
connection,
we
would
point
out
that
the--
i
don't
think
it's
seriously
contended
or
argued
that
the
discrimination
in
the
park
or
by
the
park
was
either
caused
or
induced
or
dictated
or
in
any
way
mandated
by
any
state
law,
any
local
law,
any
local
policy,
any
custom,
or
any
executive
proclamation,
such
as
we
had
in
lombard.
there
is
no
state
property
and
there
is
no
state
funds
involved
in
the
operation
of
the
amusement
park.
it
had
no
interest
in,
absolutely
no
control
over
the
park
management,
no
interest
or
no
control
over
the
management
of
the
private
detective
agency,
by
which
officer
collins
was
employed.
i
think
the
only
possible
state
involvement
in
the
discriminatory
policy
of
the
court
is
to
be
found
in
the
engagement
of
collins.
he
was
somewhat
of
a
unique
individual
occupying
two
roles.
certainly,
we
must
concede
that
he
was
a
special
deputy
sheriff
appointed
under
the
statute
that
is
peculiar
to
montgomery
county,
cited
in
our
brief.
we
also
must
concede
that
he
was
wearing
his
special
deputy
sheriff's
badge
at
the
time
of
the--
of
the
taking
into
custody
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
and
that
he
also
completed
an
application
for
a
warrant
which
indicated
that
he
was
supplying,
therefore,
in
an
official
capacity.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
our
constitution
recognizes
corporations
in
a
manner
of
creating
them.
it
doesn't
allow
for
special
corporations.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
he
would
not.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir,
we
have
that
right.
montgomery
county
local
laws
are
very
heavily
slated
toward
assuring
itself
of
safety
because,
in
an
amusement
park,
you
have
many
safety
possibilities.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
do
you
mean
outside
of
the
park,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
i'm
not
familiar
with
that.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
this
is
a--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i'm
not
familiar,
your
honor,
with
the
park
but
i
would
assume
the
roads
do
lead
to
it.
it's
a
very
popular
place.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i'm
sorry,
mr.
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
we
would
point
out,
if
your
honors
please,
in
addition
to
the
factors
which
i
just
pointed
out
concerning
mr.
collins,
that
mr.
collins
was
not
paid
by
the
state
of
maryland.
he
wasn't
even
paid
by
the
park.
he
was
par--
he
was
paid
by
the
detective
agency
which,
of
course,
is
an
independent
contractor.
there
might
be
a
point
of
distinction
here
also
of
some
significance
in
the
usual
situation
such
as
you
have
before
the
court
in
the
national
labor
relations
board
versus
jones
and
laughlin
steel
company.
when
a
large
corporation
has
police
officers
on
its
payroll,
it
generally
gets
a
commission
directly
from
the
state.
private
detective
agencies,
being
independent
contractors,
under
our
law,
cannot
enjoy
a
commission
directed
from
the
state.
these
people,
particularly
collins
in
this
case,
did
enjoy
his
special
deputy
sheriff's
commission
by
virtue
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i'd--
the
record
is
not
clear
on
that
point.
there
was
one
other
officer
of
that
agency
who
was
a
special
deputy
sheriff,
according
to
the
record.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
one
other,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
but
neither
of
them
wore
a
state
uniform.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
i
think
your
honor--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
that
the--
no,
sir.
i
do
not
think
so.
the
primary
loyalty
of
this
individual
was
to
his
employer,
the
detective
agency.
the
record
does
not
suggest
that
collins
was
a
mere
robot,
that
collins
was
not
a
thinking
man,
that
there--
i
think
the
government
suggests
that
he
was
under
the
pay
and
control
directly
of
the
park.
the
park
paid
him.
the
park
told
him
what
to
do.
but,
we
would
make
the
argument
that
his
primary
loyalty
was
to
his
own
agency
and
he's
not
going
to
do
precisely
what
the
employer
or
the
park
would
have
him
do
in
this
case.
if
he
did
something
wrong,
his
own
agency
would
have
to
answer
for
it.
now,
we
would
say
that
the
primary
loyalty
is
not
to
the
park.
the
park
didn't
pay
him.
the
agency
paid
him.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
from
collins'
viewpoint,
he
did
not.
now,
i
think
collins,
as
an
independent
contractor,
had
to
exercise
some
independent
judgment.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
he
had
a--
he
knew
the
wishes
of
the
park.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
he
knew
what
the
wishes
of
the
park
management
were.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
i
would
say
that
he
could
have
refused
to
follow--
but,
of
course,
he
did
not.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
he
did
not.
he
could've
undoubtedly
refused
to
follow,
for
the
consequences
of
that
may
well
have
been
that
the
agency's
contract
may
have
not
been
renewed
the
following
year,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
we
can
characterize
collins
as
a
mere
robot
in
the
situation.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
you
can't
con--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
think,
your
honor,
that,
in
all
canter,
that
that
was
the
reason
that
they
were
deputized,
because,
under
our
state
law,
private
detectives
have
absolutely
no
police
power.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
private
detective
agencies--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
--
have
no
police
power
under
our
law.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
think
he
was
agent
of
the
owner.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
i
think
he
had
the
right
to
exercise
it,
but,
in
doing
what
he
did,
he
certainly
acted
as
the
agent
of
the
owner.
if
he
did
not
act
at
all,
we--
of
course,
we
wouldn't
have
the
problem,
but
he
did
act.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
think
that
is
very
fair
to
say.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
we
base
it
upon
the
authority
of
the
state
to
pass
all
matter
of
laws
and
the
public
welfare.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
we've
looked
upon
--
our
state
court
looked
upon
collins,
as
my
brother
says,
as
a
double
agent.
they
used
the
word
“dual
agent”
and,
although
our
court
of
appeals'
decision
is
not
as
clear
as
it
should
be.
it
appears
to
us
that
they
are,
in
essence,
saying
that
he
was
exercising
no
state
authority
at
the
time
he
took
into
custody
these
petitioners.
and,
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
there
is
any
evidence
to--
if
this
court
finds
any
evidence
of
the--
supporting
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
maryland,
it
should
adopt
it.
hence,
we
would
not--
we
would
have
an
individual
exercising
no
state
authority
whatsoever.
we
wouldn't
have
a
problem
of
a
state
involved.
we'd
simply
have
an
individual
who
happen
to
be
a
special
deputy
sheriff
but
not
acting
in
any
state
capacity
at
the
time--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
no,
i
think,
as
an
agent,
mr.
justice
brennan,
of
the
owner
in
this
situation,
he
could've
arrested,
not
in
a
capacity
as
a
police
officer
but
as
an
agent
of
the
private
owner.
in
other
words,
the
private
owner
himself
could've
arrested
in
this
situation.
and,
as
the
agent
of
the
owner,
acting
in
non-state
capacity,
he
could've
done
the
same
thing.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
suggest
that,
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
but
i
think,
undoubtedly,
and
as
much
as
we
represent--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
i
would
think--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
would
think
all
the
powers
of
a
conservatory
of
the
peace
which
include
the
power
of
arrest
on
and
off
the
premises.
actually,
his
authority
was
limited
to
the
premises
of
glen
echo
amusement
park
but
i
think,
basically,
the--
it's
assumed
by
all,
including
the
government
and
the
petitioners,
that
mr.
collins
was
deputized
at
the
instance
of
the
park.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
in
whose
instance
he
was
deputized
at.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
probably.
it
may
have
--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
it
may
well
have
been--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
that,
i
don't
think
is
a
proper
characterization.
until
we
know
at
whose
instance
he
was
deputized,
he
could
have
been
deputized
for
the--
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
he
was
deputized.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
he
had
all
the
powers.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes.
we
would
say,
additionally,
even
if
he
was
acting
as
a
state
officer,
that
he
did
really
nothing
any
different
in
any
other
state
officer
would've
done
when
called
at
the
scene.
he
simply
arrested
under
these
circumstances.
there
are
many
cases
upholding
convictions
on
this
basis,
but
i
think
he
had
a
duty
if
he
was
acting
in
a
state
capacity
at
the
time
that
he
accosted
the
petitioners
on
the
carousel,
and
they
were
violating
a
law.
as
a
state
officer,
a
misdemeanor
being
committed
in
his
presence,
he
may
have
had
a
duty
to
arrest.
the
government
seems
to
suggest
that
a
police
officer
should
be
some
sort
of
a
mediator,
but
i
would
submit
that
that's
basically
something
for
the
magistrate
and
not
for
a
police
officer.
and,
there's
as--
and
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
officer
collins,
if
he
was
acting
in
a
state
capacity,
did
not
himself
stop
and
think
“should
i
or
should
i
not
arrest
these
people”
and
then
decide
on
the--
on
the
affirmative
course
of
arresting.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
our
courts--
our
courts
have
held,
mr.
justice
douglas,
that
when
a
police
officer
sees
a
misdemeanor
committed
in
his
presence,
he
has
a
duty
to
arrest.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
has
been
committed.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
no,
sir,
only
when
he
knows
that
a
misdemeanor
is
committed
and
he
sees
it.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
he
was
employed
in
april
initially.
this
incident
occurred
in
june.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
the
owner
told
the
officer
that
if
they
didn't
leave
in
five
minutes,
he
was
to
arrest
them.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
at
the
time
they
were
on
the
carousel
for
the
first
time,
the
officer
went
to
the
owner
again,
as
it's
suggested
in
the
record,
that
everyone
knew
that
this
was
going
to
happen
all
day
long
that
there
had
been
a
rumor--
persistent
rumor
that
there
was
going
to
be
some
difficulty
at
the
park
that
night.
so,
they
anticipated
that
these
petitioners
would
arrive.
but
to
answer
specifically
your
question,
the
affirmative
evidence
in
the
record
shows
that
when
they
were
on
the
carousel,
seated
there,
officer
collins
then
went
to
the
park
management
and
asked
them
what
he
should
do.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
my
recollection
is
he
approached
them
initially
and
then
when
they
declined
to
leave,
he
went
to
the
park
manager,
park
management
and
asked
them
what
his
instruction
should
be,
which
was--
perhaps
suggest
that
he
acted
precisely
in
doing
what
he
did.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
instruction
of
the
owner.
of
course
the
state
of
maryland
does
not
seek
here
to
justify
the
private
discrimination,
nor
do
we
appear
here
to
approve
it.
but,
under
the
existing
law,
as
we
see
it,
these
crimes--
these
convictions
were
not
unconstitutionally
secured
and
we
would,
therefore,
respectfully
submit
that
they
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
i
think
i
am.
i
can't,
in
this--
under
this
record,
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
i
can't
draw
up
a
picture
of
this
individual.
any
collusion
between
the
sheriff,
the
appointing
authority,
and
the
park
to
place
this
individual--
to
deputize
him
and
place
him
in
the
gate
to
prevent
these
individuals
from
coming
in.
the
fact
that
he
was
a
special
deputy
sheriff
in
this
case,
i
think,
is
a
happenstance.
i
don't
think
he
was
placed
there
to
enforce
or
to
better
effectuate
the
park's
discriminatory
policy.
so,
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
collusive
action.
certainly,
officer
collins,
himself,
his
presence
at
the
park
did
not
coerce
the
park
management
into
discriminating.
because
he
was
there,
he's
not
responsible
for
the
park's
discriminatory
policy.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
he's
a
special
deputy
sheriff.
he's
not
a
deputy
sheriff.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
he's
a
special
deputy
sheriff.
mr.
robert
c.
murphy
well,
this
particular
act
under
which
he
was
commissioned,
your
honor,
went
to
effect
in
1939.
it
wasn't
something
