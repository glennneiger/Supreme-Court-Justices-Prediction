[inaudible]
justice
arthur

could
he
be
convicted
and
he
could
use
self-help
and
convict
the
negros,
can
he
do
this
the
entire
time?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
can't
urge
either
--
you
have
heard
he's
bombarded.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
rauh,
we
don't
need
to
reach
that
question.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
do
we?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
if
you
go
on
here,
you
have
a
man
who
was
the
deputy
sheriff,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
isn't
that
the
question
you
now
argue?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
doesn't
the
warrant,
itself
--
the
amended
warrant
would
give
you
the
definition?
justice
arthur

[inaudible]
justice
arthur

[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
murphy,
as
i
follow
you,
when
you
said
the
first
time
reference
has
made,
the
deputy
sheriff
collins
sometime
in
the
trial
or
[inaudible],
i'm
referring
to
the
matter
of
the
transcript
as
to
the
[inaudible]
process.
first
of
them,
as
stated
in
page
a
of
the
transcript
when
he
filed
his
first
application
[inaudible]
of
the
deputy
sheriff,
the
first
warrant
that
was
issued,
the
state
warrant
[inaudible]
they
referred
to
him
as
the
sheriff.
on
page
3
of
the
[inaudible],
they
referred
to
him
as
deputy
sheriff.
on
page
3,
again
--
now
the
state
attorney
holding
the
case,
on
page
3
of
the
record,
he
reversed
it
and
[inaudible]
the
deputy
sheriff.
he
said
on
page
3,
[inaudible]
the
defense
counsel
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
this
ground.
he
fairly
stated
[inaudible]
directly,
and
declared
void
by
the
record
right
from
the
onset
of
the
trial?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
could
you
say
that
if
they
have
a
motion
to
[inaudible],
the
counsel
[inaudible]?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but,
the
one
thing
that
have
a
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
to
make
by
the
state
officer
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
the
policy
of
color
segregation.
i
submit
to
the
court
to
[inaudible]
that
the
state
policy
is
unconstitutional.
i
don't
know
how
he
could
make
any
claim.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
do
i
understand
correctly
that
you're
saying
that
your
client
did
not
arrest
the
man
without
the
warrant
and
amended
this?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
do
you
say
that
[inaudible]?
did
he
testify
that
he
arrested
them?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
are
you
saying
there's
no
arrest
in
the
park?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
they
have
previously
parked
the
picket
line?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
rauh,
though
there
maybe
or
though
there
is.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
part
of
your
argument,
part
of
your
brief,
the
second
page
of
your
argument
in
which
it
overrules
the
rights
maybe.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
hold
on.
before
you
do
that,
on
either
point
that
were
mentioned,
you
refer
both
on
reporting
to
them.
are
we,
therefore,
to
distinguish
a
fortiori
in
the
thirteenth
amendment
of
the
indictment?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
it
was
amended.
the
warrant
was
subsequently
amended.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
conforms
to
the
language
in
effect.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
that's
what
he
was.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
before
you
leave
assuming
shelley
v.
kraemer
is
fairly
different
when,
in
shelley
v.
kraemer,
the
man
who
owned
the
property
was
(inaudible)
and,
therefore,
he
has
the
right
to
make
the
decision
to
be
engaged
in
a
business
deal
of
this
kind,
not
enforcing
the
covenant
which
has
been
given
to
them?
they're
very
different.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
doesn't
(inaudible)
automatically
goes
and
decide
this
case.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
now
you
talk
about
this
issue
before
you
said
there
is
no
private
right
to
discriminate
at
a
place
of
public
accommodation.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
will
you
reach
it
though?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
are
you
(inaudible)?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
rauh,
it
would
not
be
hard
under
state
action
concept,
i
believe
it
is
a
thirteenth
amendment
issue
because
there
is
quite
a
difference
between
the
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
to
go
farther
out
in
the
argument
on
the
fourteenth,
as
you've
recommend,
the
fourteenth
was
then
basically
(inaudible),
and
therefore,
i
would
as
say
that
chapters
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
both
seem
to
pick
the
same
thing
that
the
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
may
i
ask
you
one
question
about
maryland
law.
may
i
ask
you
one
question
about
maryland
law?
most
of
the
states
provide
that
when
a
trespasser
is
on
a
man's
property,
the
owner
of
the
property
can
use
such
force
as
maybe
necessary
to
eject
him.
is
that
the
law
of
maryland?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
according
to
the
(inaudible)
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
a
rational
basis
of
discrimination--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
persuasive
or
compulsive?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so,
you
don't
say
that
all
that
this
court
has
acquired
is
some
affirmative
action
in
order
to
show
a
state
action,
do
you?
couldn't
the
state
action
(inaudible)
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
what
of
state
(inaudible)
suppose
the
sheriff
would
stand
by
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
for
state
action?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
failure
to
do
something
plainly
called
for
(inaudible)
the
right
for
inaction.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
nevertheless,
do
you
view
the
form
(inaudible)?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
do
you
regard
to
read
that
what
you
were
quoting
from
the
state
of
maryland
with
regard
to
recreational
facilities
for
the
city?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
do
you
have
anything
in
maryland
like
the
ferris
wheel
of
the
(inaudible)?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
have
you
believed
it
to
be
a
comparable
public
park?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
even
running
an
amusement
park,
just
about
anybody
said,
that
when
a
park
is
given
to
(inaudible)
on
a
purely
private
function,
can
it?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
don't
doubt
that,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
(inaudible)
as
a
smack
of
some
public
character
where
state
says
they
can
do
it
with
the
public.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
the
question
to
decide
would
only
be
that
(inaudible)
distribution
process,
is
it
(inaudible)?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
could
be
that
the
law
on
the
public
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
it
may
be
that,
in
those
instances,
there's
also
the
public
involvement,
wouldn't
you
say?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
in
any
of
the--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
one
of
the
reasons
why
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
state,
first
of
all,
pleaded
and
then
the
court
adjourned.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
would
concede
the
colloquy
to
be
a
very
visual
statement
that
the
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
on
an
additional
ground,
and
i
assume,
we
have
(inaudible)
condition
that
it
has
to
consist
with
the
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
he
brought
the
petitioner
out
there
and
he
accused
a
man
of
violence
and
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
as
the
records
supply
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
they're
very
well
seen
in
the
record
where
the
road
goes.
does
the
record
touch
upon
(inaudible)?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
this
your
last
thing
that
implies
the
state,
the
one
before
that
(inaudible)?
doesn't
it
apply
to
the
state
if
you
amend
this
warrant
to
the
new
statute
in
(inaudible)
and
the
owner?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
if
he
was
agent
of
the
owner,
he'd
want
to
defend
the
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
in
other
words,
(inaudible)
the
purpose
of
exemption.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
can
i
ask
you
this.
am
i
correct
that
the
demurrer
adopted
a
public
accommodations
law?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and,
what
constitutional
authority
do
you
seem
to
have
it
based?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
therefore,
the
law
will
divide
the
public
(inaudible)
of
carrying
out
the
state's
purpose
to
present
discrimination.
