william
l.
griffin
et
al.,petitioner,
versus
maryland.
mr.
rauh.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
also
ask,
mr.
rauh,
if
there
were
any
concessions
in
this
part
that
were
open
to
negros.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
were
none?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
said
on
which
provision
of
the
constitution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
do
that.
mr.
murphy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
haven't
said
anything
yet
about
the
deputy
sheriff.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
alright.
do
it
at
your
own
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
there
any
signs
or
anything
posted
to
the
effect
that
colored
people
were
not
be
admitted
to
the
park?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
they
know
then
that
they
weren't
welcome?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
they
were
strangers
to
the
community
and
they
walked
in
there,
would
that
make
a
difference
in
your
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
so
far
as
going
into
the
property
is
concerned,
there
was
no
trespass,
no
violation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
it
was
only
when
they
refused
to
get
out
when
told
to
do
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
the
offense
rose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
what
you
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
that
mr.
rauh
pointed
out
that
your
own
warrant
of
arrest,
your
own
warrant
of
arrest
referred
to
him
as
–
as
the
deputy
sheriff
who
ordered
him
off
the
property.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
said
it
didn't
become
known
until
his
own
admission
at
the
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
they
change
their
warrant
of
arrest
then
if
it
wasn't
important
to
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
could
anyone
fail
to
know
if
he
had
it
on
his
--
on
the
outside
of
his
shirt,
a
special
deputy
sheriff
of
montgomery
county?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
told
us
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
told
us
what
it
was.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
why
are
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
he
--
isn't
the
deputy
sheriff,
whether
he's
special
or
not,
entitled
to
wear
the
badge
of
his
authority?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
did
you
say
without
authority?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
difference
would
it
make
if
he
was
the
deputy
sheriff?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
it
wasn't
done
by
the
park
at
all,
but
suppose
it
was
a
policeman
who
was
doing
what
they
call
moonlighting,
working
on
off
hours
at
some
park
or
dance
hall
or
someplace
like
that,
then
he
did
have
--
but
he
have
his
badge
on
and
had
the
power
of
a
police
officer,
what
difference
would
it
make?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
acts
as
a
policeman,
i
would
think
it
would
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
be
pretty
significant
if
a
man
comes
around
with
any
kind
of
uniform
and
has
a
badge
on
that
says
deputy
sheriff
and
says
“get
off
of
this
property
or
i'll
arrest
you.”
it's
significant
in
that
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
difference
would
that
make?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
so
far
as
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
was
wearing
a
badge.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
--
i'm
just
going
to
ask
you
this.
if
--
is
there
any
difference?
did
he
have
any
different
power
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he
was
a
deputy
sheriff
than
if
he
had
not
been
and
had
only
been
a
lieutenant
of
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
if
he
had
not
had
this
power,
he
could
not
have
arrested
in
this
place.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
did
he
get
a
warrant
before
he
arrested
the
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
took
them
to
jail.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
took
him
to
jail
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
got
the
warrant,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
murphy,
may
i
ask
you
this.
what
was
the
date
is
this
offense,
the
alleged
offense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
was
the
date
of
the
state
warrant,
the
warrant
that
he
got
out
for
his
arrest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
same
night?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see,
but
when
was
it
--
when
did
they
file
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
that
delay
between
june
30
and
august
4?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
guess
i
don't
understand
your
procedure.
that's
what
--
i
was
just
wondering
if
a
month
and
almost
a
week
later
seems
rather
a
long
time
in
which
to
file
a
warrant
that
was
issued
as
a
result
of
an
arrest
in
a
misdemeanor
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see,
but
they
don't
file
the
warrant
until
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
the
trial
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
states
i
know
they
file
it
as
soon
as
it's
sworn
to.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
he
didn't
owe
any
duty
to
the
park
management.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
then
there
was
a
necessary
agency
between
him
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference,
would
it,
if
he
acted
through
them
whether
he's
employed
by
the
agency
or
by
the
park?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
say
here
that
that's
all
he
was
doing,
don't
you?
he
was
following
the
orders
of
the
park.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
my
point
is
--
my
point
was
this,
what
i
was
going
to
ask
you
about.
you
say
that
he
was
not
acting
as
a
peace
officer,
but
all
he
was
doing
was
acting
under
the
orders
of
the
park.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
couldn't
have
acted
as
he
did
if
he
didn't
been
an
officer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we're
concerned
here
whether
the
arrest
was
unlawful
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
ultimate
issue,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that's
for
the
purpose
of
giving
them
a
police
power
that
they
wouldn't
have
if
they
were
simple
night
watchman
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rauh.
chief
justice
earl
warren
here
is
that
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
14.
chief
justice
earl
warren
william
l.
griffin
et
al.,
petitioners,
versus
maryland.
mr.
rauh,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rauh,
do
you
consider
any
significance
that
when
he
swore
to
the
complaint,
he
swore
to
it
as
a
deputy
sheriff
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
argument
would
mean
that,
assuming
that
there
--
assuming
that
there
is
a
private
right
of
discrimination
virtually--
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
would
be
a
right
of
self-power
to
enforce
that
right.
the
constitution
permits--
forbids
the
creation
of
judicial
remedy
and
plays
itself
out.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
take
it,
the
hornbook
interpretation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
murphy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
murphy,
in
advertising
for
people
to
use
this
facility,
did
the
company
advertise
generally
to
the
public
and
invite
everybody
to
the
public
or
did
it,
in
its
advertisements,
say
“for
whites
only”?
chief
justice
earl
warren
generally
for
the
public?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
it
have
any
signs
on
its
property,
posted
on
its
property,
to
prevent
negroes
from--
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
it
be
because
they
weren't
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
there
any
fences
or
anything
to
prevent
the
public
generally
from
coming
into
the--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
into
the
place?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
there
was
no
limitation
then
on
who
could
come
in
there
until
they
got
to
one
of
the--
one
of
the
facilities.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
there
were
no
gates.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think--
i
think
i
understand
what
your
situation
is.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
all
the
policemen
of
this
agency
deputized?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
on
this
property?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
if
his
primary
loyalty
wasn't
to
the
park,
the
manager
didn't
have
the
right
to
command
him
to
do
this
thing
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
exercised
his
own
judgment
in
putting
these
men
off
the
court--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
notwithstanding
any
orders
that
he
might
get
from
the
manager.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
he
was
not
obliged
to
follow
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
would--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
would
an
agency
like
that
want
to
deputize
these
men
if
they
didn't
give
them
the--
some
power
of
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
hasn't?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
exactly
agree
with
that,
do
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
do
you
believe,
mr.
murphy,
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
put
its
police
officers
in
every
or
any
place
of
business
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
segregation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then,
aren't
you
faced
with
that
problem
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
certainly,
the
sheriff
knew
of
these
difficulties
that
were
going
on
at
the
park
for
a
long
time.
everybody
else
knew
it.
it
was
in
the
press,
wasn't
it,
so
far
as
to
this?
so,
he
must
have
known
that
this
deputy
sheriff
was
in
there
enforcing
a
power.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know,
but
he's--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
deputy
sheriff
was
a
deputy
sheriff
in
the
eyes
of
the
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may
have
that
much.
