justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
general
what
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
excuse
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
question
is
going
to
be
what
has
happened
in
the
physical
construction
of
this
project
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
during
the
pendency
of
this
suit.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
all
been
stopped?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
statutory
and
not
a
constitutional
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
think
that
reapportionment
cases
dealt
with
water
rights?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
say
the
government's
basic
position
that
this
is
an
unconsented
suit
mr.
rowe?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
say,
what
are
you
--
are
you
going
to
address
yourself
to
the
government's
basic
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
just
wondering
what
you're
going
to
say.
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
agreement
that
this
is
an
unconsented
suit.
what
then
is
the
situation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
so
i
thought
you
argued
virtually
in
relation
to
your
consented
suit
--
unconsented
suit
there.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
putting
it
more
directly,
supposing
you
lose
in
your
immunity
position,
can
this
case
be
reversed
or
dealt
with
up
here
or
on
the
merits
or
it
has
to
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
it
goes
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they've
already
decided
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
alright,
i
see
your
point
now.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
quite
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
quite
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
agree.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
bearing
if
any
do
you
think
the
fact
that
the
government
or
the
officials,
the
reclamation
officials
who
had
given
this
election
so
to
speak
between
taking
the
injunction
and
the
physical
solution,
what
bearing
do
you
think
that
that
election
has
if
any
on
the
government's
immunity
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
--
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
you
haven't
dealt
with
the
government's
basic
argument
at
all
in
any
of
your
appearances.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
i
may
say
so.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
can't
argue
the
case
for
you,
mr.
rowe.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
the
government
is
here
on
a
one
basic
point,
that
they're
immune
from
suit,
that
although
informed,
this
is
a
suit
against
the
individuals
because
of
the
arguments
that
they
make
and
what
follows
in
the
larson
case
that
this
in
effect
has
an
impact
on
the
government
which
means
that
it
cannot
be
sued
without
its
consent
and
that
it
isn't
--
hasn't
given
its
consent
either
by
virtue
of
such
an
aid
of
reclamation
act
or
by
virtue
of
208
and
i
haven't
heard
you
address
anything
to
either
of
those
arguments
up
today,
any
of
those
arguments.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
volume
is
this
in?
justice
john
m.
harlan
alright.
