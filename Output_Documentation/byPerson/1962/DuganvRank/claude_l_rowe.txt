mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes
honorable
court.
you
have,
i
believe,
presented
to
you
a
large
green
brief
by
the
city
of
fresno
in
which
most
of
the
acts
of
congress,
involving
the
central
valley
project
are
listed.
at
the
start,
i
would
like
to
make
a
correction
and
state
that
we
do
not
agree
with
the
map
before
this
court.
this
so-called
river
from
that
point
down
here
does
not
exist
and
i
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
what
did
you
say?
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
i
said
the
san
joaquin
river
according
to
the
--
well,
what
i
just
said
that
this
river
from
there
to
here
does
not
exist
and
that
will
come
up
in
the
state's
argument
at
a
setting
position,
the
map
is
incorrect.
now,
i
know
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
i
will
show
you.
there
is
no
such
stream
from
here
to
this
square
nor
from
the
square
to
this
other
so-called
lake
and
if
it
is
not
out
of
line
to
--
it
just
does
not
exist.
it
never
existed
as
a
natural
channel.
now
that
is
shown
by
exhibit
6
opposite
page
86
of
the
green
brief,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
proper
to
mention
the
chief
justice's
name.
his
name
appears
on
the
cover
of
that
bulletin
that
that
map
was
printed
on.
so
i
think
that's
--
if
it's
proper
to
mention
his
name,
i
think
that's
pretty
good
evidence
that
the
stream
does
not
exist
as
a
natural
stream.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
that
is
in
the
green
brief,
the
large
green
brief
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
51.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
no.
in
other
words,
this
was
put
in,
i
think,
in
an
effort
to
avoid
the
[inaudible].
it
is
our
position
--
this
is
the
kern
river,
the
kern
river
terminates
in
buena
vista
lake.
there's
no
natural
water
way
from
there
to
larry
lake.
there's
an
artificial
waterway,
but
this
indicates
it's
a
natural
stream
and
it
therefore
possibly
the
kern
river
is
in
the
watershed
at
the
san
joaquin.
they
also
attempted
to
connect
that
to
the
san
joaquin.
i
would
like
to
point
out
a
map
as
exhibit
2,
opposite
page
16
of
the
green
brief
which
was
prepared
for
the
district
court
in
the
decision
below
and
that
map
prepared
by
the
united
states
bureau
of
reclamation
does
not
show
any
stream
from
buena
vista
lake
to
larry
lake.
now,
that
will
--
i
think
that
point
may
become
important
later
in
the
argument.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
in
california,
according
to
the
fundamental
war,
the
county
of
origin
and
watersheds
of
origin
are
to
receive
all
necessary
water
before
any
water
is
exported
out
of
the
watershed
or
the
county
of
origin.
now
fresno
lies
in
fresno
county
which
is
bounded
by
the
stream
on
the
south
and
by
the
san
joaquin
on
the
north.
the
act
of
congress
of
october
14,
1949
specifically
requires
the
bureau
of
reclamation
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
recognize
the
county
and
watershed
of
origin
acts
in
the
operation
of
the
central
valley
project.
part
of
the
city
of
fresno's
complaint
is
based
upon
--
it
is
in
the
county
of
origin
of
the
san
joaquin
river
and
in
the
watershed
of
the
san
joaquin
river
where
this
water
originates
so
that
under
state
law
and
under
the
act
of
october
14,
1949,
fresno
and
these
landowners
and
the
watershed
of
the
san
joaquin
has
specifically
been
given
water
to
the
extent
of
their
needs
before
the
secretary
can
attempt
to
import
that
water
out
of
the
county
and
watershed
of
origin.
now
the
district
court
found
that
the
larry
county
which
lies
down
to
fresno
county
and
kern
county
down
here
was
not
in
the
watershed
of
the
san
joaquin
river.
i
do
not
believe
that
was
stately
appealed,
it
may
have
been.
but
the
district
court
so
found
that
the
kings
river
here,
they
were
at
one
time
two
inland
seas,
one
here
and
one
here
that
the
kern
river
drains
into
buena
vista
lake
and
stops,
that
these
other
rivers
into
larry
and
kern
county,
drain
into
the
larry
lake.
due
to
levies
of
buena
vista
lake
and
an
artificial
channel,
waters
had
been
forced
to
run
into
larry
lake
and
by
levies
here
have
been
forced
maybe
twice
in
one
hundred
years
to
run
into
the
san
joaquin
river.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
what
did
you
say?
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
the
riverbed
--
there
is
no
riverbed.
there
is
an
artificial
channel.
there
are
some
slews
and
an
artificial
channel,
but
in
determining
a
watershed,
i
believe
under
the
law,
a
watershed
is
determined
by
natural
channels
that
you
cannot
put
yourself
in
the
watershed
by
digging
a
ditch
over
into
another
watershed.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
what
did
you
say?
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
this
is
the
kern
river,
your
honor.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
that
is
buena
vista
lake.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
the
law
is
also
clear.
i
think
that
a
watershed
in
this
area
is
not,
assuming
that
is
true,
a
watershed
down
here
is
not
in
the
watershed
of
the
area
above
the
junction.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
i
don't
know
whether
the
government
does
or
not.
i
think
the
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
in
other
words
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
i
--
they
first
come
out
and
said
that
they
were
powered
to
take
the
water
from
the
city
of
fresno
and
county
of
fresno's
watershed
and
even
though
they
needed
it
and
were
entitled
to
it,
both
under
state
law
and
the
acts
of
congress,
they
should
take
it
out
here,
i
think
they've
abandoned
that
position,
maybe
not.
they
now,
under
the
authorities,
they're
attempting
to
come
in
you
might
say
the
backdoor
and
claim
they're
in
the
watershed.
they
have
relied
on
state
bulletin
29
which
is
one
of
the
bases
of
the
central
valley
projects
when
the
state
of
california
took
it
over.
and
that
bulletin
as
quoted
in
my
reply
brief
to
the
government
and
to
the
districts
that
the
districts
agreed
to
that
point.
the
government
didn't
raise
it
in
their
brief,
state
that
the
kern
river
watershed
is
into
larry
and
kern
county
that
the
watershed
of
the
san
joaquin
is
in
fresno
county,
but
i
point
that
out.
now
the
government
did
not
raise
that
point.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
no.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
my
--
or
our
position
is
this.
the
state
of
california,
by
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
and
by
two
statutes,
give
protection
to
the
county
and
watershed
of
origin
that
by
the
reclamation
act
of
1902,
the
government
must
proceed
in
accord
with
state
laws
in
their
operation
of
the
reclamation
projects.
but
to
clear
that
up
beyond
all
doubt,
congress
on
october
14th,
1949,
the
act
is
quoted
in
my
brief,
specifically
enjoined
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
proceed
and
conform
to
all
california
county
of
origin
and
watershed
protective
act.
so
therefore,
our
position,
they
cannot
take
and
under
the
youngstown
sheet
and
tube
case
if
the
secretary
is
unauthorized,
an
illegal
taking
is
not
an
act
of
the
government
and
there
cannot
be
damages.
there
is
no
tucker
act.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
that's
a
statutory
argument.
that
is
why
i
point
those
facts
out.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
that
is
another
question.
the
federal
act,
the
1937
act
puts
domestic
use
and
irrigation
use
on
an
equal
footing.
the
act
of
1939
contains
a
provision
which
i
do
not
think
is
material
in
this
case
for
the
reason
that
as
the
california
water
rights
board
found,
the
districts
are
getting
so
much
water,
they're
about
to
become
water
logged.
now
that
was
the
decision
of
the
california
water
rights
board
which
has
never
shown
any
particular
friendship
for
fresno,
but
that
act
says,
the
1939
act
says
that
the
secretary
may
not
give
water
to
a
city
if
it
would
injure
the
irrigation
features
of
the
project.
if
the
act
is
involved
the
city's
position
is
that
that
act
is
unconstitutional
that
it
was
put
through
by
the
powerful
[inaudible]
because
as
shown
by
senate
document
113,
referred
to
in
the
brief,
the
central
valley
project
provides
for
dams
on
every
river
in
the
state
of
california.
if
there
is
a
government
dam
now
in
friant
on
to
san
joaquin,
there's
a
government
dam
on
the
kings
river.
there's
a
government
dam
being
constructed
on
the
[inaudible]
tule.
there's
already
one
on
the
kern.
now,
those
are
army
projects,
the
last
ones
but
they're
all
under
the
final
plan
of
the
government
and
it's
our
position
that
in
view
of
secretary
freedman's
statement
that
we
now
have
50
million
acres,
too
much
agricultural
land
in
this
country
and
that
there
will
be
50
million
acres
of
excess
agricultural
land
as
late
as
1980
that
a
city
should
not
be
destroyed
by
an
act
of
congress
that
it
would
violate
the
fifth
amendment
to
say
that
human
beings
shall
be
deprived
of
their
sole
source
of
supply
in
order
to
grow
surplus
crops
for
the
government
which
is
the
government
is
paying
some
5
million
or
billion
dollars
a
year
and
even
if
there
was
not
a
surplus
that
one
may
--
matter
came
to
growing
crops
or
giving
water
to
the
citizens
of
california
that
congress
did
not
deprive
the
citizens
of
california
of
water.
now,
we
claim
that
if
there
is
a
shortage
of
water
that
--
that
section
9
(c)
is
unconstitutional,
we
ask
this
court
as
they
did
in
the
reapportionment
cases,
the
farmers
controlled
all
the
legislatures.
their
lobbies
were
so
powerful.
they
control
the
congress.
the
cities
had
to
come
to
this
court
to
get
a
fair
deal
and
we
ask
this
court
to
give
the
city
of
fresno
and
the
other
city
of
the
nation
a
fair
deal
from
that
powerful
lobby.
now
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
no,
we
are
different
but
i
think
it
did
deal
with
the
power
of
the
agricultural
group
as
against
the
city
but
the
political
power
and
i'm
not
against
a
farmer
if
i
have
to
be
a
farmer
myself,
but
as
well
as
i
hope
an
attorney
but
i
do
think
that
this
court
did
justice
in
that
case
to
something
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
get
through
congress
or
the
legislature.
now
we're
not
such
an
orphan
child
as
possibly
counsel
would
have
us
believe
or
might
have
you
believe.
i
don't
think
he
said
we
were.
there
is
a
--
going
back
to
this
map,
let's
go
for
a
minute,
it
might
be
well
to
point
out
the
--
as
opposing
counsel
did,
the
excess
water
in
the
sacramento
valley,
sacramento
river
has
a
toll
of
17,100,000
acre
feet
a
year,
the
san
joaquin,
1,751,000
acre
feet
per
year.
there's
another
point
that
in
the
course
of
nature
before
friant
dam
in
this
area
and
the
court
has
so
found
and
the
bureau
of
reclamation
has
admitted
211,000
acre
feet
use
to
seep
into
this
area
in
the
course
of
nature
the
law
--
before
friant
dam.
since
the
flow
has
been
cut
down,
water
levels
have
dropped
as
far
as
a
100-acre
--
100
feet
in
four
years,
the
court
--
district
court
so
found.
in
the
city
of
fresno,
they
dropped
over
35
feet.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
i
didn't
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes,
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
alright.
now
as
to
the
government's
argument,
our
position
is
not
entirely
unsustained
by
legal
authority.
this
court,
in
approving
the
court
of
claims
in
the
gerlach
case,
held
that
the
central
valley
project
was
to
give
water
to
the
six
counties
including
fresno.
this
court
has
also
approved
or
cited
with
approval
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
on
this
case
on
the
motion
to
dismiss.
that
was
done
in
united
states
versus
gerlach,
339
u.s.
725.
in
other
words,
the
district
court
in
this
case,
their
first
decision
has
been
cited
with
approval
by
this
court
and
going
further
into
the
government's
claim
or
position,
the
court
of
claims
has
ruled
that
the
area
from
friant
dam
to
gravelly
ford
canal
under
the
central
valley
project
was
to
be
served
with
water.
if
you
will
read
the
answers
of
the
various
defendants,
practically
all
of
them
ask
that
the
district
court
make
a
physical
solution.
the
state
of
california
first
asked
that
the
district
court
construct
five
check
dams
to
make
the
water
seep
out.
the
government
admitted
the
possibility
of
four
check
dams.
the
plaintiffs
asked
10
--
14
check
dams
in
order
to
bring
the
water
to
their
pumps.
the
court
allowed
10.
now
we're
not
going
to
argue
with
the
government
on
whether
a
physical
solution
is
proper.
the
government
approved
the
principle
or
this
court
has
approved
the
principle
of
a
physical
solution
when
it
affirmed
the
court
of
claims
case
in
gerlach
live
stock
company
versus
the
united
states.
that
case
is
cited
in
full
in
our
brief
and
i
don't
know
whether
it's
proper
to
read
the
statement,
read
a
few
statements
as
you
go
along
to
emphasize
the
point
or
not.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
i
know
that
you
will
read
it
and
i
--
after
reading
your
calendar,
i
know
that
the
time
of
this
court,
i
don't
see
how
they
get
through
their
calendar.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
compelled
the
government?
yes.
in
the
appendix
that
page
16
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
it's
two
paragraphs.
i
attempted
to
quote
the
entire
act
where
they
brought
the
--
they
reauthorized
the
central
valley
projects
to
include
the
american
river
here.
they
make
this
statement
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
it
dates
back
to
1935,
but
as
shown
by
united
states,
the
court
of
claims
case,
there
had
been
certain
amendments
to
the
project.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
that
is
one
section.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
alright.
nothing
contained
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
by
implication
or
otherwise
as
an
allocation
to
water
in
the
studies
for
the
purpose
of
developing
plans
for
disposable
water
as
herein
authorized.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
shall
make
recommendations
for
the
use
of
water
in
a
court
where
state
water
laws,
including
but
not
limited
to
such
laws
giving
priority
to
the
counties
and
areas
of
origin
for
present
and
future
needs.
now
that
same
act
reauthorizes
in
the
first
chapter,
the
act
of
august
26,
1937
which
puts
domestic
and
irrigation
upon
the
equal
bar.
we
also
rely
upon
the
act
of
june
17th,
1902,
the
basic
reclamation
act
which
requires
as
i
read
the
act.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
the
page
you
want?
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
the
act
of
august
26,
1937
appears
at
page
14
of
the
supplement.
it
uses
the
word
second
for
irrigation
and
domestic
uses
in
referring
to
the
central
valley
project.
it
simply
reauthorized
that
act,
but
i
am
relying
on
a
specific,
as
i
interpret
it,
congressional
mandate
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
the
act
of
october
14th,
1949
to
give
priority
to
count
--
to
quote,
“giving
priority
to
the
counties
and
origin
--
of
origin
or
present
and
future
needs,
also
to
the
basic
reclamation
act
of
june
17th,
1902
which
appears
at
page
6,
the
summary
or
appendix
of
the
green
brief
in
which
--
that
nothing
in
this
act
shall
be
“nothing
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
as
affected
or
intended
to
affect
or
to,
in
any
way,
interfere
with
the
laws
of
any
state
or
territory
relating
to
the
control,
appropriation
use
or
distribution
of
water
and
irrigation
or
any
vested
right
acquired
there
under
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
carrying
out
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
proceed
in
conformity
with
such
laws.
my
view
is
that
that
would
require
irrespective
of
the
act
of
1949,
the
secretary
to
recognize
california
county
and
watershed
of
origin
acts.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
how
should
he?
well,
he
should
recognize
it
by
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
claims
in
this
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court
putting
fresno
in
the
area
to
receive
water
under
the
central
valley
project.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
i
will
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
at
a
price
which
is
not
unreasonable.
i'm
going
to
quote
a
decision
of
this
court
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
well,
we
take
the
position
that
under
the
county
of
origin,
we're
entitled
to
have
a
sufficient
amount
run
down
the
river.
however,
we
do
not
press
that.
we're
willing
to
pay
for
the
water
out
of
the
central
valley
project
if
we
can
get
it.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
no,
it
is
not.
i
might
state
this
at
the
city
of
fresno,
i
was
going
to
that,
has
--
pumps
from
the
under
ground.
it
has
a
capacity
from
the
underground
of
30,000
acre
feet
of
the
year
--
a
year.
right
now,
it
is
pumping
over
60,000
acre
feet.
the
bureau
of
reclamation
officials,
very
honest
engineers,
admitted
that
the
city
should
not
pump
more
than
30,000
acre
feet.
those
same
engineers
said
that
that
the
city
was
--
should
have
100,000
acre
feet
of
supplemental
water.
now
all
that
we're
asking
in
this
case
is
that
under
the
act
of
1949,
our
engineer
said
we
needed
more,
but
was
ask
as
a
minimum
that
the
city
and
fresno
--
that
the
city
get
at
least
100,000
acre
feet
out
of
the
project
before
it's
taken
out
of
the
county
and
watershed
of
origin
and
we
will
pay
a
price
which
is
not
unreasonable.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
their
charge
and
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
no,
they
will
not
sell.
they
have
given
us
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
i
might
bring
this
out
up
until
1944,
the
city
of
fresno
was
doing
fine
and
we
could
have
gotten
water
but
there
was
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
mr.
bock
who
came
in
there
and
he
decided
that
fresno
should
get
no
water.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes,
he
is.
i
didn't
mean
to
bring
that
out.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
i
didn't
--
did
i
say
a
termite
expert?
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
i
did?
i
apologize.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
i
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
he
was
not
an
engineer
i
might
say.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
he
was
not
an
engineer.
so
the
city
of
fresno
attempted
to
get
mr.
krug
and
mr.
spraws
and
mr.
bock.
mr.
bock
was
the
ring
leader,
he
ran
california,
to
get
them
at
least
100,000
acre
feet
of
water.
it
got
so
bad
finally
that
is
pointed
out
in
my
brief.
congress
took
by
saying
that
no
man
who
was
not
an
engineer
could
receive
its
salary,
took
them
off
a
payroll.
they
finally
were
taken
under
the
bureau,
the
secretary
and
the
other
two
gentlemen
in
1953
and
i
will
say
this
to
the
credit
of
the
bureau,
since
then,
they
have
come
in
and
given
us
a
contract
for
60,000
acre
feet
of
water
at
$10
and
they
were
fair
enough
to
do
this.
the
engineers
who
built
both
their
dams
grand
tule,
they
put
in
there
that
the
price
and
other
terms
of
that
contract
would
be
subject
to
final
determination
of
this
point.
i
think
that's
being
pretty
fair
and
that
gets
down
to
the
question
of
the
price
of
water
and
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
all
unless
this
court
orders
them
to
give
us
as
being
in
the
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes,
we
have.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
even
at
$10
but
we
wanted
a
provision
in
there
that
the
price
could
be
finally
ruled
upon
by
this
court
whether
$10
was
an
unreasonable
price
or
not
and
beyond
the
power
of
the
secretary.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
oh
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
i
will
use
the
time
on
my
next
case.
pardon
me.
i
didn't
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
i
never
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
quite
so
many
questions
at
one
time.
now,
i
would
like
to
just
read
you
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes,
that
is
in
substance.
there
is
one
other
feature.
there
are
two
other
features.
first,
that
the
owners
between
friant
and
gravelly
ford
received
a
sufficient
water
supply.
now
--
then
there
is
another
party
in
this,
the
tranquility
irrigation
district
which
appears
in
this
area
in
agreement.
they're
an
old,
old
time
irrigation
district.
they
have
received
water
from
the
san
joaquin
river
for
it
backs
up
in
the
fresno
slew
and
which
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
held
as
a
bay
of
the
san
joaquin
river.
there
is
no
dispute.
the
bureau
of
reclamation
officials
left
it
alone
as
they
have
in
the
past
have
given
them
water
on
a
formula
and
the
court
approved
that
formula.
and
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
dispute
regarding
tranquility.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
there
is
no
longer
a
dispute.
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
appeal
and
therefore,
we
feel
that
tranquility
is
entitled
to
the
water.
they're
getting
it
just
like
the
great
bureau
of
engineers
had
analyzed
they
should
get
the
amount
and
they
of
course,
get
theirs
free.
going
back
to
the
city
of
fresno
and
its
right
to
object
or
to
ask
for
a
reasonable
rate,
this
court
has
decided
that
question
i
believe
in
swigart
versus
baker,
229
u.s.
187.
in
yuma
water
users
association
versus
schlech,
262
u.s.
138
in
which
this
court
ruled
on
the
reasonableness
and
the
legality
of
the
rate
for
water
and
the
government
was
not
a
party
to
the
action.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
was
not
a
party.
now
we
feel
that
the
opposing
counsel
had
not
been
able
to
answer
those
two
decisions
of
this
court.
we
take
this
position
beyond
that
that
the
determination
of
whether
a
rate
for
water
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable
like
the
determination
of
whether
an
electric
power
rate
or
railroad
rate
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable,
that
is
a
matter
for
the
courts.
within
the
bounds
of
reason,
that
is
a
--
in
the
--
a
matter
for
the
administrative
agency.
there
is
smyth
versus
ames,
169
u.s.
also
backs
that
up.
the
question
--
one
very
good
decision
of
this
case,
i
think,
is
hynes
versus
grimes,
337
u.s.
86
in
which
the
united
states
was
not
a
party
neither
was
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
but
one
of
the
questions
in
that
case
was
the
secretary
of
the
interior
having
power
to
license
fishing
in
alaska,
could
he
charge
an
unreasonable
rate
and
he
had
attempted
to
charge
in
that
rate,
money
for
the
welfare
projects
of
the
indians
in
the
reservations.
this
court
held
that
that
was
beyond
his
authority.
here,
the
secretary
is
attempting
to
charge
a
profit
to
the
city
of
fresno
to
be
used
to
benefit
the
farmer.
we
think
the
cases
are
on
all
force
that
that
is
beyond
his
power.
that's
up
to
congress.
congress
and
this
court
have
decided
that
the
rate
to
be
repaid
to
a
bureau
of
--
on
a
bureau
of
reclamation
project
should
be
the
cost
of
the
project
plus
cost
of
operation
and
maintenance.
now
under
the
act
of
1939,
congress
allowed
the
secretary
to
add
an
interest
charge
of
not
to
exceed
three
and
a
half
percent.
that
interest
charge,
he
fixed
at
two
and
a
half
percent.
it
is
our
position
in
accordance
with
the
decision
to
this
court
that
if
you
put
in
an
exception
that
limits
his
powers.
he
can't
go
beyond
that.
his
powers
were
limited
to
repayment,
a
rate
to
the
city,
repayment
of
the
cost
to
construction,
cost
of
operation
and
maintenance
plus
some
interest
charge.
there's
nothing
in
the
1939
act
or
in
any
act
that
gives
him
the
authority
to
go
into
the
welfare
business
which
is
exclusively
in
the
hands
of
congress.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
he
gets
the
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
to
the
cities?
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
he
gets
the
authority
to
sell
to
the
cities
under
the
old
act
of
1906.
that's
the
first
act
which
allows
him
to
sell
two
cities
and
they
provided
in
there
and
not
less
than
the
farmers,
not
more
but
they're
afraid
the
cities
will
get
it
for
less.
under
the
act
of
1939
which
is
cited
august
4th,
1939
cited
at
the
index
in
14
of
our
brief.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
index
of
the
appendix.
he
is
allowed
to
charge
not
to
exceed
three
and
half
percent
interest
to
the
cities.
now,
the
irrigation
districts
admit
that
from
their
point
of
view
that
for
$9000
of
capital
improvement,
the
cities
are
being
required
--
$9
million
of
capital
improvement
allocated
to
the
municipal
water
part
of
the
central
valley
project.
the
city
there
is
being
asked
to
repay
$28
million.
now,
at
two
and
a
half
percent
interest
over
40
years
that
means
the
cost
of
the
project
would
be
increased
40%.
so
that
under
that
formula
and
taking
their
figures,
the
city
should
not
pay
over
some
$12,600,000
and
not
for
$28
million,
and
we
go
back
to
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
also,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
gerlach,
a
cattle
company
case
in
which
the
broad
statement
is
made
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
opinion
that
the
project
shall
be
repaid
over
a
40-year
period.
there
are
other
acts
that
require
a
reasonable
and
equitable
allocation
of
the
cost
of
the
project,
but
i
think
the
act
of
1939
is
fundamental
if
you
read
it
in
accordance
with
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
gerlach
case
that
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
i
really
think
that
--
actually,
maybe
this
green
brief
will
show
that.
if
you
will
look
at
exhibit
2
of
the
green
brief,
the
lands
in
the
gerlach
case
are
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
that
is
opposite
page
16.
the
lands
in
the
gerlach
case
are
marked
very
much
downstream.
see
this
area
here
near
the
mouth
of
the
merced
river.
now
there
are
31
other
cases
for
damages
there.
those
cases
as
you
recall
where
--
for
the
right
to
have
the
water
overflow
the
banks
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
finally
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
that
would
set
under
that
map
--
i
would
say
probably
right
in
here.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
the
merced
river
comes
in
here.
now
right
north
of
the
san
joaquin
is
the
fresno
river.
now
the
next
one
up
is
the
merced.
the
gerlach
lands
lie
just
upstream
from
the
junction
of
the
merced
and
the
san
joaquin.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
no
sir.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
it
is
not
but
you
did
approve
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
and
holding
there
could
be
a
physical
solution
in
holding
that
the
central
valley
project
was
to
furnish
water
to
the
six
counties
which
would
include
fresno
and
mr.
bock
attempted
to
eliminate
entirely
from
the
benefits
of
the
central
valley
projects.
and
these
lands
in
the
gerlach
case
were
lands
who
were
given
damages
merely
due
to
an
overflow,
an
uncontrolled
overflow.
they
were
not
carried
to
ditches.
they
just
deny
water
and
they
were
wet
and
this
court
ruled
that
they
have
never
been
that
high
water.
now
in
regard
to
the
gerlach
case
as
i
say,
the
plan,
feasibility
report
of
december
2nd,
1935
has
been
amended
by
raising
the
high
defiant
dam
and
providing
for
water.
the
owners
between
friant
dam
and
gravelly
ford
which
is
just
about
in
here,
fairly
close
to
mendota
--
oh
well
here's
gravelly
ford.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes,
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
i
say
that
he
has
that
power
unless
they
are
--
unless
his
powers
are
limited
by
congress.
the
congress
alone
can
give
the
right
to
condemn.
if
they
have
not
done
it,
he
has
not
any
power
to
take
by
either
eminent
domain
or
condemnation.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
that
grants
a
power.
but
i
think
it
has
to
be
read
with
the
basic
reclamation
act
of
1902
which
was
repassed
in
1956.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes,
perfect.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
that's
right.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
this
is
what
the
secretary
represented
to
the
congress
that
he
intended
to
do.
this
is
in
regard
now
to
the
rights
between
friant
dam
and
gravelly
ford.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
no.
i
said
that
the
secretary
may
take
by
either
eminent
domain
or
condemnation
any
right
authorized
by
congress.
now
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
this
is
what
the
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
and
because
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
and
because
you
interpret
their
power
by
such
statements
as
this
“there
are
certain
existing
rights
downstream
from
friant
which
have
to
be
supplied
including
the
riparian
rights
on
the
river
between
friant
dam
and
mendota
pool,
water
needed
for
preservation
of
fish
life
and
water
bowl.
it
has
been
determined
a
150,000
acre
feet
of
class
1
water
must
be
reserved
to
meet
these
requirements.
now
that
is
set
forth
in
the
record
at
2284.
in
other
words
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
mr.
stoner
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
engineer
stoner
was
testifying
for
the
secretary
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
--
before
the
bureau.
when
they
come
in
and
say,
“that's
what
we
want
the
money
for
and
we're
going
to
protect
these
rights
there,”
i
think
the
people
along
the
river
do
have
rights.
as
i
say,
i
think
the
county
of
origin
flow
also
protects
them.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
if
you
will
notice,
i
do
not
see
the
state
of
california
brief
here.
i
have
a
letter
that
mr.
moss
was
not
appearing
or
authorizing
anyone
and
he
is
the
only
one,
the
attorney
general.
he
appeared
up
to
a
certain
time.
i
do
not
see
how
he
could
have.
he
asked
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes,
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
no
brief
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
and
i
also
make
the
point
that
the
attorney
general
came
in
to
the
district
court
and
asked
that
california
be
dismissed
from
this
action
and
the
district
court
dismissed
them
and
i
do
not
see
how
he
can
legally
file
a
brief
after
that
unless
it
was
a
mixture,
i
agree.
i
might
say
that
the
governor
or
the
attorney
general
first
came
in
on
the
side
of
the
plaintiffs
to
eat
fish
and
then
there
was
a
change
and
the
attorney
general
opposed
us.
i
admit
that
opposition.
he
then
came
in
and
ask
to
get
out
of
the
case
and
i
do
not
think
any
appearance
after
he
was
dismissed
from
the
case
as
the
legal
appearance
but
you
will
notice
that
the
attorney
general
has
no
longer
come
in
and
opposed
us
on
his
last
brief.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
i
would
say
so
because
as
i
understand
the
rules
of
this
court,
you
cannot
come
in
and
file
an
amicus
curiae
brief
without
permission
of
all
parties
which
we
did
not
grant
and
without
getting
the
permission
of
this
court
and
i
may
be
wrong.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
you
can
assume
that
the
attorney
general,
i
had
a
letter,
i
didn't
want
to
get
involved
in
personalities.
i
was
going
to
file
mr.
goldberg
and
mr.
veeder
and
i
have
fought
for
about
12
years
here.
i
have
decided
i
shouldn't
try
to
exclude
anybody
from
arguing
this.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
i
think
the
state
is
absolutely
neutral
today
or
they
wouldn't
be
in
here.
i
--
in
closing,
i
do
call
your
attention
to
the
grimes'
case
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
does
not
have
the
power
to
go
into
the
general
welfare
business
of
the
nation,
that
has
left
the
congress.
and
he
can
--
as
there
--
he
could
not
put
a
high
fish
license
tax
to
spend
on
the
welfare
of
the
indians,
these
are
here
made
a
secondary
put
a
high
tax
upon
the
cities
to
aid
the
farmers.
if
they
want
to
be
aided
beyond
the
interest
charged
then
it's
up
to
congress.
thank
you
for
your
attention.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
to
briefly
answer
opposing
counsel,
opposing
counsel
said
that
the
underground
water
rights
have
not
been
affected,
the
district
court
held
that
if
the
bureau
of
reclamation
plan
were
put
into
operation
without
check
dams,
100,000
acres
of
land
would
be
destroyed
and
200,000
would
be
damaged.
nobody
ever
appealed
from
that
opinion.
it
was
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit.
there's
been
no
appeal
on
that
point.
so
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
a
proper
subject
for
discussion
now.
i'm
not
--
counsel
has
been
liberal
with
me.
i
made
mistakes
in
some
of
my
quotations
but
i
do
point
that
out.
now,
counsel
says
that
the
county
of
origin
should
not
apply
or
it
does
not
apply,
i
might
just
briefly
point
out
one
representation
of
the
bureau
to
congress
in
that
regard.
that
is
in
senate
document
13,
81st
congress,
page
65.
it
appears
at
146
of
the
large
brief
and
this
is
what
the
bureau
has
consistently
represented
to
congress.
“in
addition
to
respecting
all
existing
water
rights,
the
bureau
in
this
report
has
complied
with
california's
county
of
origin
legislation
which
requires
that
water
shall
be
reserved
for
the
presently
unirrigated
lands
of
the
areas
in
which
the
water
originates
to
the
end,
that
only
surplus
waters
will
be
exported
elsewhere.”
i
think
that
destroys
any
thought
that
there
can
be
a
condemnation
or
taking
by
eminent
domain
and
it
also
destroys
any
contention
without
interpretation
that
the
act
of
1949
does
not
apply.
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
--
anything.
i
did
not
say
that,
sir.
i
think
we're
only
entitled
to
pay
something
that
is
reasonable
when
it
gets
beyond
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
i
told
you
under
that
--
under
the
theory,
we
--
the
city
of
fresno
has
two
rights.
it
has
the
right
in
my
opinion
to
have
the
amount
they
need
to
run
down
the
river.
the
bureau
of
reclamation
officials
have
pointed
out
it
can
be
pumped
over
the
bank
and
into
the
city,
however,
i
told
you
we're
willing
to
pay
for
it.
although
we
have
that
right,
i
think
without
paying
for
it
provided
we
go
down
to
the
river
and
get
it,
we're
asking
to
pay
a
reasonable
amount.
we
have
a
second
right
under
the
central
valley
project
act
and
wherein
the
service
area
as
shown
by
this
map,
exhibit
6
put
out
by
the
state
of
california
in
the
1950s.
and
under
that,
if
i
have
the
right
to
go
down
and
by
a
post
extent,
we're
entitled
to
use
the
government
service
and
--
but
we're
asking
not
to
be
blocked
in
that
by
having
an
unreasonable
rate
charge.
now,
does
that
answer
your
question
or
--?
if
we
can
get
the
water
we'll
pay
a
reasonable
price
and
a
lawful
price
for
it.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes,
yes,
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
i
think
that
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
let's
look
at
it
from
a
different
point
of
view.
i
have
shown
that
since
1950
in
the
nine
years
instead
of
the
183,000
acre-feet,
the
plaintiff's
asked
to
go
down
the
river
under
physical
solution
the
government
has
actually
released
626,000
acre-feet
a
year.
so
that
there
is
water,
i
have
shown
that
the
district
may
become
water
logged.
i
don't
think
that
the
provision
in
the
act
of
1939
saying,
“you
cannot
affect
agriculture”
would
apply
but
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
alright.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes,
we
would.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
i
am
going
to
point
this
out.
we
have
in
our
original
suit,
we
set
have
forth
our
two
applications.
this
is
the
municipal
system.
we
filed
application
by
--
in
the
--
about
1930
to
appropriate.
the
government
has
application.
the
district
judge
we
ask
that
our
applications
be
given
priority
over
the
government
on
the
ground
that
the
water
rights
board
had
enacted
a
delay
in
administrative
procedure.
the
water
rights
board
then
started
to
act.
the
district
court
enjoined
their
action
until
he
made
his
decision.
he
made
his
decision
stating
the
district
court
did
that.
the
city
of
fresno
had
priority
under
the
county
of
origin.
senate
backed
the
water
rights
board.
they
advertised
all
the
people
in
the
--
along
the
river
came
in
and
i
don't
know
whether
out
of
order,
but
i
wrote
for
a
copy
of
that
decision.
the
state
water
rights
board
put
ten
conditions
that
gave
the
water
to
the
government.
first,
that
they
recognize
vested
rights
on
the
river.
secondly,
that
they
take
care
of
the
city
of
fresno
at
least
to
the
extent
of
50,000
acre-feet,
fairfield
water
district
to
the
extent
of
3,500
feet
who
were
a
party
at
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
no,
the
government
was
given
a
permit
subject
to
10
conditions,
one
that
they
give
the
city
of
fresno
at
least
50,000
acre-feet
of
water
or
more
if
the
city
would
get
upon.
what
did
you
say?
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
no.
and
in
their
decision,
it
said,
their
entire
decision
is
subject
to
final
decision
in
this
court.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
no.
the
united
states
bureau
of
reclamation
engineer,
very
honestly
and
fairly
and
at
great
risk,
said
the
city
of
fresno
and
testified
needed
a
100,000
acre-feet.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
subject
to
our
right
to
appeal
to
this
court
to
get
some
more.
yes,
yes.
and
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
eventually
by
the
year
2000
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
no,
we're
really
waiting
for
the
final
decision
in
this
court.
we
are
using
between
60,000
and
65,000
acre-feet.
we
can
safely
pump
30,000
and
as
my
brief
will
show,
every
10
years,
the
city
of
fresno
increases
46%
in
population
and
area.
so
it
won't
take
long
to
use
the
water.
the
water
rights
board
also
gave
the
fresno
irrigation
district
water
were
located
in
the
middle
of
the
fresno
irrigation
district,
86,000
acre-feet
but
they
never
gotten
that
contract
and
that
is
in
the
same
area.
pardon
me.
as
we
said,
we
feel
if
there
are
any
other
questions.
alright
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
it's
set
forth
in
the
brief.
i
can
point
it
out
the
city
engineers
estimate
is
set
forth
in
this
green
brief,
just
a
minute.
at
page
83,
they
estimate
by
1980
a
use
of
a
111,000
acre-feet,
that
would
be
21,000
acre-feet
more
than
the
60,000,
and
the
30,000
we
can
safely
pump.
by
the
year
200,000,
we
would
be
shy
a
107,000
acre-feet,
i
mean
2,000,
pardon
me,
[attempt
to
laughter]
would
be
shy
177,000,
and
that's
at
page
83,
the
estimate.
now,
i
have
pointed
out
on
the
reasonable
determination
of
what
is
reasonable.
the
districts
admit
that
we
are
--
the
municipalities
are
going
to
have
to
pay
$29,667
--
$29,667,000.
that
the
cost,
construction
cost
--
that
is
on
construction
costs
are
only
$9,091,000.
if
you
add
2.5%
interest
that
is
charged
over
40
years,
since
the
money
is
out
for
only
half
of
the
time,
the
interest
will
increase
the
cost
40%
adding
that
--
added
interest
cost,
would
bring
up
what
we
should
pay
to
$12,828,000
as
against
the
$29
million
charge.
we
think
the
facilities
are
much
less
but
just
to
show
why
we
feel
are
violating
the
act
of
1939.
now,
on
the
waiver
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes,
i
want
to
say
--
i
say
that
i
shouldn't
be
one
to
complement
such
a
high
standing
man
as
the
solicitor
general,
but
he's
been
extremely
fair
in
his
argument
and
the
bureau
engineers
had
been
very
fair
with
us.
and
when
--
also
the
--
it
may
have
been
the
solicitor
that
allowed
that
to
go
into
our
contract.
but
we
think
we
--
our
contract
was
very
fair.
we've
shown
the
dire
need
of
the
city
of
fresno.
i'll
not
go
into
that,
page
46
and
47
of
the
green
brief
that
shows
how
that
off
we
are,
100-foot
drop
in
four
years
in
areas
near
us.
now,
on
the
waiver
of
immunity,
we
are
standing
fundamentally
on
the
theory
that
even
on
the
case
that's
cited
by
the
solicitor,
that
when
an
administrative
official
goes
beyond
the
powers
given
him
by
congress
as
he's
done
in
our
contention
by
charging
profit
on
top
of
interest
then
we
are
entitled
to
sue
the
local
official
and
get
justice.
supposing
the
postmaster
general
would
charge
6
cents
for
the
new
price
in
stand,
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
affecting
the
united
states
treasury
if
somebody
files
a
suit
to
get
stamps
at
the
rate
that
the
government
has
set
forth.
so
we
feel
we're
entitled
to
same
on
the
water.
now,
on
waiver
of
immunity,
my
time
is
nearly
over,
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
in
our
--
the
city's
original
complaint,
they
asked
an
adjudication
between
the
filings.
the
court
decided
it
had
to
go
through
the
administrative
agency,
now
which
is
correct.
the
administrative
agency
gave
the
government
the
filings
after
complete
advertising
and
if
it
is
proper,
i
had
written
to
water
rights
board,
i
didn't
have
a
copy
of
the
decision
if
it's
proper
to
offer
this
decision
at
this
time
that
just
came
in
air
mail
from
the
state
water
rights
board,
i
will
leave
it
with
the
court,
these
conditions
were
put
in.
there
was
general
advertising
and
people
clear
down
here
because
of
delta,
you
can
see
that
delta
associations
were
in,
every
irrigation
district,
everybody
was
given
a
chance
to
come
in.
i'll
leave
that
with
the
court
with
that
general
adjudication.
it
was
done
under
california
law.
there
was
no
appeal.
there
is
an
appeal
provided
by
the
court
to
the
courts.
the
government
didn't
appeal.
the
city
didn't
appeal.
we
have
gone
ahead
and
that
appeal
has
said,
“it's
up
to
this
court
being
the
final
court
in
so
many
words
to
decide
how
much
water
we're
entitled
to
and
at
what
price
and
i
feel
that
that
goes
far
beyond
the
jennings
case
or
any
case
cited.
now,
another
thing,
the
government
announced
and
it's
taken
by
eminent
domain
except
for
the
exchange
here,
everything
below
gravelly
ford.
there
are
238
decisions
or
rulings
by
the
district
court
and
all
the
districts
were
parties
and
taking
that
altogether,
i
don't
think
there's
any
case
in
existence
that
will
say
there
hasn't
been
under
those
facts,
the
general
adjudication.
it's
--
it
was
advertised,
everybody
appeared,
and
i'll
submit
that
to
this
court,
but
we're
relying
on
the
grimes
case
that
you
can't
--
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
it
is
congress
and
not
the
secretary
of
the
interior
that
provides
for
welfare
legislation.
thank
you.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
to
briefly
answer
mr.
goldberg
that
it's
merely
a
matter
of
dropping
the
wells
a
few
feet,
the
bureau
of
reclamation's
own
engineer
specify
that
in
this
area
prior
to
friant
dam
from
here
to
mendota
and
they
kept
record
for
years
211,000
acre-feet
procurated
from
the
river
out
into
this
alluvial
cone.
and
you
can
see
it
how
far,
but
there's
no
dispute
that
211,000
acre-feet
procurated
from
the
river
to
supply
the
underground.
now,
when
mr.
goldberg
tells
you
that
five-second
feet
passing
down
the
river
is
going
to
make
that
amount
is
arithmetic,
is
slightly
erroneous
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
criticizing
either,
but
five-second
feet
means
to
2
acre
--
a
second
foot
is
two
acre-feet
a
day.
five-second
feet
would
be
10-acre-feet
a
day
and
if
you
ran
that
all
year,
that
amount
would
produce
3,630-acre-feet
if
i'm
correct,
mr.
goldberg,
circulation
for
the
whole
year,
3,600
as
against
211,000
acre-feet.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
no
five-second
feet.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
but
i
mean
if
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
as
he
did
say,
it
might
take
a
lot
more
water
at
friant
but
this
five-second
feet
test
going
down
the
river
at
all
places,
that
could
mean
a
very
small
--
a
much
smaller
amount,
211,000
acre-feet.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes
and
remember
this,
i
think
he
was
arguing
something
that
is
not
before
this
court
at
the
present
time.
the
district
court
found
that
if
this
plan
of
five-second
feet
would
be
put
into
operation
without
check
dam
and
without
allowing
approximately
186,000
acre-feet
to
come
down
back
at
the
check
dam
to
procurate
out
into
the
side
that
200,000
acres
of
the
land
within
the
alluvial
cone
and
i
think
that
should
be
pointed
out
to
the
court,
it's
in
exhibit
2
of
the
green
brief.
it's
called
a
lease
line.
the
court
found
that
if
the
five-second
foot
theory
was
put
into
operation,
100,000
acres
of
this
land
would
be
completely
destroyed.
i
don't
know
whether
i'm
right
about
the
county
of
fresno
but
it
does
produce
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
is
that
what
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes,
but
they've
never
done
that.
they
have
been
during,
i
don't
say
they
do
it
just
on
account
of
a
pendency
of
this
action,
but
they've
been
allowing
626,000
acre-feet
a
year
to
come
down
the
river.
from
1951
when
they
finished
the
kern
canal
up
to
date.
now,
that
would
not
show
this
yet
in
the
destruction
of
a
land.
but
the
court
found
that
100,000
acres
would
be
destroyed
and
my
recollection
is
that
the
price
per
acre,
run
as
high
as
a
thousand
dollars
and
it
means
that
the
damage
to
the
government
is
$100
million
as
against
the
cost
of
the
government
approximately
1
million
for
the
check
dam.
i'm
not
going
to
argue
the
physical
solution.
i
--
the
state
of
california,
the
original
bureau
defendants
and
the
irrigation
districts
and
the
city
all
ask
for
it.
now,
if
they
don't
want
it,
there's
a
provision
in
the
complaint
for
inverse
condemnation
at
paragraph
four
which
the
district
court
has
held
for
damages.
now,
i
seriously
wonder
whether
the
bureau
engineers
want
a
ruling
--
had
a
physical
solution
of
doubt.
as
the
ninth
circuit
said,
a
physical
solution
isn't
for
the
benefit
of
the
land
owner,
that's
to
give
an
appropriator
like
the
government
the
right
to
give
him
a
substitute
service
by
any
means
in
the
most
economical
and
with
the
less
use
of
water.
in
the
gerlach
cattle
company
case,
11140
claims
that
this
board
approved
the
doctrine
of
physical
solution
was
of
which
this
court
affirmed
was
approved.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
argue
the
physical
solution.
i
think
down
in
the
heart
of
the
engineers
as
opposed
to
theorist
in
the
legal
departments
maybe
myself
included,
i
think
they'd
be
very
happy
with
that
cheap
physical
solution
but
i
can't
say
that.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
given
in
nebraska
versus
wyoming
a
quote
from
the
--
my
brief
here,
the
same
question
this
court
asked
itself,
should
we
get
in
to
continuous
administration
of
the
stream?
and
the
court
said,
“well,
if
it's
our
duty
to
do
it,
we
should
do
it.”
now,
that
in
nebraska
versus
wyoming
is
cited
in
this
--
in
my
brief,
i'm
sorry,
i
can't
just
put
my
finger
on
this
but
it's
there
and
there's
another
case
where
this
court
approved,
the
water
master
which
was
continuous.
i
know
the
way
i
feel,
there
are
a
lot
of
merits
in
that
suggestion.
the
court
still
going
to
be
in
there
running
it,
but
the
california
doctrine
of
physical
solution
as
set
forth
in
the
lodi
case
requires
the
court
to
take
continuing
jurisdiction
so
that
he
can
--
if
he
can,
he
can
cut
the
water
down.
now,
i
can
argue
if
you
have
a
feeling
that
--
well
here,
these
engineers
are
running
these
projects
and
what
does
the
court
in
there
for
but
under
the
doctrine
of
physical
solution,
it
does
give
the
government
the
right
to
force
a
substituted
service
upon
the
riparian
owner.
and
as
the
ninth
circuit
quoted
in
their
decision,
that's
an
advantage
to
the
government,
that
isn't
an
advantage
to
the
landowner
because
they
can
substitute
wells,
they
can
substitute
check
dams.
and
if
you
will
notice
the
check
dam
idea
is
in
a
general
way
approved
by
almost
everybody.
mr.
goldberg
himself
put
on
evidence
that
there
ought
to
be
five
check
dams
and
he
cut
it
down
to
three
when
he
was
trying
the
case
and
the
government
admitted
that
might
be
necessary
to
put
in
four
or
five.
i'm
not
going
to
argue
the
physical
solution
part
because
i
think
there
would
be
a
tremendous
damage
action
possible
there
whenever
they
cut
down
this
626,000
acre-feet
a
year
to
60,000.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
i
--
i
think
it
ties
into
their
immunity
argument,
i
think
that
tends
to
show
a
waiver
of
immunity
because
even
the
secretary
at
least,
it
goes
to
show
there
wasn't
a
taking.
they
didn't
intend
to
take
it.
the
secretary
mckay,
he
says,
we
go
along
with
the
state
of
california,
and
plan
a
physical
solution.
well,
if
they're
going
to
keep
putting
water
down
there,
you're
not
taking
something
from
somebody.
also,
if
you'll
notice
in
the
bureau
of
reclamation
officials'
answer,
they
ask
the
complaint
be
dismissed,
but
in
the
alternative,
they
ask
the
court
to
determine
what
lands
are
entitled
to
water,
two,
the
amount
of
water
they're
entitled
to;
and
three,
to
make
a
decree
to
give
it
to
them.
now,
as
i
say,
i
think
somewhere
down
the
line
in
the
lawsuit,
the
government
should
be
bound
by
the
standard
things.
and
if
you
ask
me,
i
think
it's
just
fairness
and
logic
when
they
ask
the
court
to
make
a
determination
of
how
much
water
should
go
down
the
river,
they
shouldn't
be
able
to
later
on
say
on
a
field,
“well,
we're
immune”
from
what
we
ask.
i
don't
know
whether
that
answered
your
question
or
not.
is
there
any
other
that
i
might
attempt
to
answer?
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
would
you
tell
me
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
--
which
one
that
is,
i
will
try
to
do
it
possibly.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
alright,
i
will
endeavor
to
do
it.
all
of
the
decisions,
first,
all
of
the
--
we
are
suing
here
an
administrative
officer
under
the
theory
that
he
is
violating
and
acting
in
excess
of
the
powers
conferred
by
congress.
that
being
true
under
the
yuma
case
and
the
swigart
case
dealing
with
great
under
the
case
of
the
fishing
licenses
in
alaska
under
even
lane
versus
dollar,
that
is
not
a
suit
against
the
government
and
the
official
maybe
restrained
from
violating
the
act
of
congress
which
in
my
opinion
in
this
case
is
the
act
of
1949
which
requires
the
bureau
to
recognize
the
county
of
origin
legislation.
now,
assuming
that
isn't
true,
i
haven't
tried
to
press
it,
but
under
the
gerlach
case,
this
court
held
that
when
a
--
the
government
comes
in
to
seek
an
appropriation
of
water
in
a
state,
they
must
conform
to
the
state
law.
the
government
came
in.
we
originally
filed
a
suit
to
determine
the
application
between
the
city
of
fresno
and
their
priority
in
the
government.
that
government
came
in,
the
water
rights
board
and
the
court
referred
it
to
the
administrative
agency.
the
water
rights
board
advertised
the
entire
river
as
they've
done
in
other
decisions
on
the
sacramento
and
the
american
river.
everybody
had
a
right
on
that
river
to
come
in.
it
was
tried.
the
government
was
given
the
permit
to
appropriate
water
subject
to
two
additions
that
they
recognized
vested
rights,
secondly,
that
fresno
gets
at
least
50,000
acre-feet
of
water.
neither
party
appealed.
i
think
that
that
is
a
complete
adjudication
under
the
act
of
1952.
i
don't
know
what
else
you
could
do.
and
as
i
have
stated
here,
if
you
go
on
the
other
theory
that
everything
below
gravelly
ford
has
been
condemned
since
no
water
taken
by
eminent
domain
except
the
substitution
of
water
that
formally
came
out
of
mendota
pool,
if
you
take
that
theory,
the
government,
there
were
208
parcels
of
land,
47
and
i
–
in
my
view
the
government's
brief
didn't
--
have
not
settled.
the
government
owned
certain
rights.
the
districts,
all
of
the
districts
were
parties.
everybody
down
to
the
end
of
where
the
water
was
to
flow
and
you
know
that
that
point,
remember,
it
doesn't
say
a
stream
system.
there
is
a
second
alternative
or
other
source,
and
that
source
is
friant.
everybody
from
friant
was
a
party
to
that
litigation.
the
district
court,
the
government
came
in
and
presented
evidence
that
they
had
bought
from
millerton
lake
certain
reserved
water
rights
which
cut
into
the
riparian
rights.
they
put
in
evidence
that
they
had
purchased
water
rights
shown
on
the
exhibit
a-48a,
type
of
contract.
the
riparian
owners
proved
what
land
was
riparian.
the
district
court
ruled
on
every
specific
parcel
--
208
parcels.
it
ruled
the
right
of
the
district
and
in
my
view,
i
will
submit
it
that
this
--
by
this
court
whether
that's
not
an
adjudication
under
the
acts
of
1952,
waiving
the
government's
immunity
under
the
warning
of
other
source,
not
complete
river
system.
so
that
either
under
the
hearing
by
the
state
water
rights
board
which
was
not
appealed
or
by
this
determination
if
you
will
look
in
the
large
volume
at
a
--
in
exhibit
a-91a
it
--
it
shows
beginning
up
here
–
somewhere
down
here,
pardon
me,
beginning
up
here
with
friant
dam
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
that
is
the
printed
record
from
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
every,
the
208
parcels
were
ruled
upon
whether
the
government
had
the
rights
or
whether
they
were
riparian
rights.
the
government
--
the
district
court
ruled
how
much
water
may
be
used
for
each
of
the
crops.
i
feel
that
that
was
a
complete
adjudication
of
the
rights
from
another
source
or
other
source,
friant.
now,
this
court
has
held
that
if
all
parties
had
been
brought
in,
the
plaintiff
has
the
right
to
ask
that
they'd
be
brought
in
and
then
in
our
brief
we've
asked
that.
now,
the
government
counsel
can
tell
me
who
else
we
ought
to
bring
in
if
they're
taking
everything
from
gravelly
ford
down
or
have
taken
it
by
eminent
domain,
we've
litigated
every
district.
we've
litigated
an
entire
area.
i
would
ask
this
court
permission
to
bring
such
defendants
in.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
they
said
it
was
not
that
kind
of
a
suit,
you're
right
and
we
have
appealed
for
that
part
of
their
decision.
now
finally,
mr.
goldberg
says
that
these
water
rights
have
been
taken
by
eminent
domain.
i
don't
think
so.
in
the
first
place,
the
act
of
1902
and
1949,
require
the
government
to
recognize
the
county
or
origin.
the
bureau
of
reclamation
has
the
whole
congress.
they
are
recognizing
those
rights
and
reserving
water,
not
damages.
under
the
youngstown
case,
you
cannot
condemn
anything
unless
authorized
by
congress.
and
since
it
wasn't
authorized,
there
couldn't
be
a
taking
by
condemnation
or
eminent
domain.
not
only
that,
i
think
the
interpretation
of
the
california
agencies
is
also
very
helpful.
i
would
just
like
to
read
to
and
that
will
conclude
my
remarks
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
the
government
could
if
congress
had
authorized
the
taking
of
the
county
of
origin
rights,
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
if
they
have
authorized
it,
i
would
say
that
they
could
condemn
but
i
would
agree
with
the
lower
court
that
they
have
not
taken
it
as
yet.
they've
not
expressed
an
intension
to
taking
it.
they're
letting
the
water
run
down
the
river,
they're
making
compacts
and
they're
recognizing
those
rights
down
the
gravelly
ford,
but
frankly
the
government
does
have
the
right.
it
could
condemn
them
out,
county
of
origin
or
no
county
of
origin
if
congress
had
limited
them
from
doing
it.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
they
would
have
a
right
to
sue
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
for
taking
by
eminent
domain
or
condemnation.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
they
do
have
--
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
not
to
take
water
needed
in
the
county
and
watershed
of
origin.
i
do
not
think
because
by
the
act
of
1949
which
reauthorized
the
entire
central
valley
project,
the
government
made
that
clear
that
the
secretary
might
not
take
water
needed
in
the
county
or
watershed
of
origin.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well,
there
would
be
a
question
as
mr.
goldberg
has
said,
possibly
the
statute
could
run
on
it.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
well
then,
if
the
government
--
if
congress
had
authorized
the
taking,
there
could
be
a
suit
where
there
had
been
a
taking
but
i
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
government
has
never
indicated
in
and
then
--
and
to
depict
these
rights
between
here
and
there
or
to
take
personal
right.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
they
are
threatening
to,
and
i
think
the
minute
possibly
--
this
is
not
criticism
if
this
lawsuit
is
over.
i
think
the
620,000
--
6,000
acre-feet
of
water
that
goes
down
the
river
will
go
back
to
the
60,000
acre-feet
that
they
threatened
they
got
to
do.
and
then
since
211,000
percolated
into
the
ground
alone,
there
would
be
a
taking
and
if
they're
authorized
to
take
it,
in
that
case,
there
could
be
a
suit
for
damages.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
no,
i
think
that
the
reauthorization
of
the
central
valley
project
as
put
in
1937
along
with
the
mentioned
protecting
county
of
origin.
i
think
that
that
covers
the
whole
act
now.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
no,
i'm
--
one
thing
i
think
he
did
wrong.
you
can't
reauthorize,
go
back
to
1937
and
reauthorize
an
act
and
say
that
the
secretary
must
conform
to
the
county
of
origin
and
then
say
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
1937
enactment.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
do
it.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
the
entire
project
is
complete.
the
government
has
done
in
addition
to
the
central
valley
project,
they
have
built
some
dam
on
the
american
river.
they
have
an
alternative
river
project
up
here
but
the
entire
original
central
valley
project
as
set
forth
in
the
feasibility
report
in
december
2nd,
1935
is
complete.
i
think
counsel
will
agree
with
me
on
that.
if
i
may
read
then,
just
some
interpretations
of
the
law
by
california
people,
“as
a
manner
of
both
state
and
federal
law,
it
appears
that
the
united
states,
the
bureau
of
reclamation
as
well
as
its
parent
organization,
the
department
of
the
interior
and
the
secretary
thereof
are
obligated
to
observe
water
code
sections…”
i'm
reading
from
the
bottom
of
page
147
of
my
green
brief,
“11460
to
11463
in
carrying
out
the
central
valley
project.”
then
the
second
quote,
“whatever
may
have
been
the
intent
of
the
legislature
in
adopting
these
statutes,
we
cannot
conclude
that
it
was
intended
thereby
to
deprive
areas
such
as
the
city
of
fresno
and
the
fresno
irrigation
district
of
a
source
of
water
supply
so
readily
accessible
to
them
at
that
obtainable
from
the
san
joaquin
river.”
we
believe
that
the
legislature
in
adopting
watershed
protection
sections
11460,
11463
and
the
county
of
origin
sections
10500
to
504
and
10505
was
expressing
a
policy
that
area
such
of
the
city
and
the
district,
both
highly
developed
and
well-established,
located
almost
at
the
very
outlets
of
friant
dam
should
not
occur
deficiencies
and
supplies
such
as
they
are
now
suffering
while
water
is
transported
pass
them
to
distant
undeveloped
lands.
now,
that's
the
water
rights
board
that
farms
out
the
water.
now,
this
is
from
mr.
goldberg's,
former
boss,
the
attorney
general,
from
25
opinions
of
the
attorney
general,
1955-21,
“the
legislative
background
as
a
priority
makes
it
difficult
to
concede
that
the
legislature
intended
that
the
authority
could
destroy
the
priority
by
condemnation.
since
the
priority
exist
only
as
against
the
authority,
such
as
construction
would
completely
destroy
the
effect
of
section
11460
and
make
it
in
the
--
its
enactment
and
idle
gesture.”
and
if
you
say
that
you're
giving
protection,
water
to
the
areas
in
which
it
originates
and
at
the
same
words
saying,
you
can
take
it
away
by
condemnation,
i
think
that
congress
never
intended
that.
i
think
they
intended
to
back
up
the
cities,
city
of
fresno
and
other
people
that
i
have
told.
this
area
here
which
is
an
agricultural
area
in
california,
it
is
not
asking
government
subsidies.
it
grows
grapes,
raisins,
citrus.
you
have
the
dried
fruit
capital
of
the
world.
there
is
some
party,
they
are
carrying
their
own
load
and
all
they
need
is
water
and
we
humbly
ask
you
gentlemen
to
get
that
closed.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
no,
i
would
say
that
they
could
take
whether
a
surplus
or
not
as
long
as
the
great,
rich,
highly
developed
--
historically
developed
areas
in
california
are
left
with
sufficient
water
supply.
i
don't
think
congress
ever
intended
to
dry
up
the
richest
agricultural
county
in
the
united
states.
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
for
it
should
not
take
water?
mr.
claude
l.
rowe
yes
and
i
think
that
is
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general,
mr.
goldberg's
former
boss,
the
present
governor
when
he
said,
“even
though
they
have
taken
it,
if
in
the
future
they
needed,
the
government
has
to
give
it
back
to
them
and
the
people
don't
have
to
pay
the
government
anything
for
the
project.
now,
i
agree
with
mr.
goldberg's
boss.
i
agree
with
the
water
rights
board
who
really
are
the
people
who
say
who
gets
the
water.
now,
i
want
to
thank
you
very
much
for
your
kindness.
