justice
william
o.
douglas
you
mean
to
say
that
if
the
government
is
putting
up
a
dam
that
will
flood
my
house
that
i'm
without
any
remedy
to
stop
me
from
doing
it
unless
they
condemn
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
means,
if
--
if
they
take
no
measures
to
acquire
the
land
within
the
project.
justice
william
o.
douglas
no,
it's
authorized.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
mean
the
government
--
the
government
official
never
convey
as
trespasser.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
suit
again
--
against
an
official
under
the
government.
justice
william
o.
douglas
why
isn't
the
government
can
--
the
government
has
--
the
government
is
much
more
powerful
than
an
individual
that
they
can
condemn,
can't
they?
why
don't
they
condemn?
justice
william
o.
douglas
under
the
tucker
act.
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
a
person
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
if
a
person
is
timely
in
his
suit
and
so
on.
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
think
it
is
doubtful
that
there
was
a
taking
here?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
those
cases
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
sudden
rise.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
suppose
the
land
cases
were
at
a
special
place
in
this
court's
decision
in
protection
of
the
leac
--
i
brought
for
instance
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
think
that's
vulnerable
when
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
as
a
natural
stream?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
there
a
bed
of
river
there?

william
o.
