mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
yes,
your
honor.
the
general
position
taken
on
behalf
of
the
districts,
is
that
all
the
water
rights
in
this
case
which
are
necessary
for
the
operation
of
the
project
have
been
taken
that
by
that
taking
title
has
vested
in
the
united
states,
but
there
is
nothing
further
to
do
in
these
cases
except
you
dismissed
them
in
trial.
now,
before
going
into
that
general
subject,
i'd
like
to
pause
a
moment
on
the
question
of
the
counties
of
origin
and
the
areas
of
origin.
as
mr.
cox
has
pointed
out,
there
are
really
two
different
sets
of
statutes
here,
the
county
of
origin
statute,
sometimes
talked
about
is
a
statute
water
code
--
california
water
code
section
10505
which
is
a
scheme
for
withdrawing
unappropriated
water
so
that
it
may
be
used
in
the
development
of
coordinated
water
projects.
and
assignments
of
those
applications
can
be
made
in
the
discretion
at
the
time
of
this
case,
the
state
director
of
finance,
if
in
his
judgment
it
will
not
deprive
the
county
of
origin
of
the
water
necessary
for
its
development.
such
assignments
were
made
in
this
case
bearing
the
record
in
volume
1
at
pages
110
to
111.
the
more
difficult
problem
is
the
problem
of
the
so-called
watershed
protection
statutes
or
area
of
origin
statute
which
gives
a
preferential
right
really
to
project
service.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
we
have
two
briefs,
your
honor.
we
have
a
yellow
one
which
is
a
reply
brief
in
number
51
and
we
have
a
green
one
which
is
our
opening
brief,
that's
it.
that's
it.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
that's
it.
now,
the
county
--
the
area
of
origin
statute
is
really
a
right
to
preferential
service
from
state
water
projects
and
by
preferential
service,
i
do
not
mean
a
price
preference
in
any
sense.
as
developed
by
the
attorney
general
of
california
in
the
opinion
to
which
mr.
cox
referred,
you'll
see
that
the
county
of
origin
statute
--
excuse
me,
the
area
of
origin
statute
or
watershed
protection
statute
can
be
viewed
in
three
different
ways.
one,
what
is
its
impact
on
vested
rights
within
these
areas
of
origin.
well,
the
answer
to
that
appears
in
the
statute
itself.
it
says,
“in
no
other
way
then
by
purchase
or
otherwise
as
provided
in
this
part,
this
is
california
water
code
section
11461
at
page
382
of
volume
7
of
the
record.
the
vested
rights
within
the
area
of
origin
can
be
condemned.
there
is
no
restriction
in
state
law
on
their
condemnation.
the
next
is
and
this
appears
in
the
attorney
general's
opinion,
the
25
opinions
cal.
attorney
general,
i
believe
it's
at
page
22.
yes,
sir.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
no,
i
used
to
be
an
assistant
attorney
general.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
at
present,
i
am
chief
deputy
director
of
the
state
department
of
water
resources
but
my
appearance
in
this
case
is
simply
as
a
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court
representing
the
13
irrigation
and
other
districts
involved
here
as
if
they
were
my
private
clients.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
no.
i
was
not
representing
the
districts.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
no,
i
am
not.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
well
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
california
was
in
this
case
and
i
may
say
as
long
as
the
subject
came
up
through
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
urged
on
attorney
general
moss
that
the
participation
be
continued,
however,
for
reasons
which
are
his,
he
declined
to
participate
further.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
no.
now,
as
i
say,
the
next
element
of
the
area
of
origin
statute
which
i'd
like
to
mention
is
the
effect
that
that
statute
might
have
as
giving
a
preferential
right
to
appropriate
a
surplus
water
to
uses
within
the
areas
of
origin
and
that
i
was
referring
to
page
22
of
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
25
ops.
cal.
attorney
general.
well,
the
attorney
general
then
said,
when
the
priority,
meaning
the
inchoate
priority
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
watershed
of
origin,
asserted
by
such
an
inhabitant,
is
asserted
by
such
an
inhabitant
and
with
its
aid,
he
acquires
and
becomes
vested
with
a
water
right
in
accordance
with
sections
1200
to
1800
of
the
water
code
which
is
the
procedure
for
applying
for
a
permit
and
eventually
getting
a
license
to
divert
surplus
water,
the
authority
to
appropriate
such
water
right
may
be
purchased
or
condemned
by
the
authority
if
necessary
for
the
purposes
of
the
project.
so
when
the
inchoate
priority
becomes
vested,
it
too
may
be
purchased.
however,
the
situation
in
which
we
find
ourselves
in
this
case
is
this.
fresno
undertook
to
obtain
authority
from
the
state
to
divert
water
in
accordance
with
its
applications
which
have
been
referred
to
by
mr.
rowe
and
that
authority
was
denied
by
the
state
water
rights
board.
and
having
had
that
authority
denied
by
the
state
water
--
state
water
rights
board,
fresno
has
no
standing
to
assert
it's
any
preferential
use
in
--
because
of
its
location
in
an
area
of
origin
under
that
heading.
it
has
no
vested
right.
it
has
no
preferential
right.
it
has
no
right
to
appropriate
surplus
waters.
so
what
does
fresno
have
by
virtue
of
its
standing
in
the
area
of
origin
and
what
--
and
i
relate
this
to
the
various
statements
which
the
interior
officials
made
--
have
made
from
time
to
time.
what
does
fresno
have?
it
has
a
right
to
project
service
and
that
right
to
project
service
of
course
has
been
given
to
it
through
the
medium
of
the
contract
for
60,000
acre-feet
at
$10
an
acre
foot.
now,
there
is
nothing
--
yes
sir.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
it's
vested
--
its
vested
rights,
and
i
will
come
to
this
in
a
moment,
its
vested
rights,
if
it
had
any,
have
been
taken
by
the
united
states.
it
has
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
in
my
opinion,
it
would
not,
because
in
my
opinion,
it's
outside
the
area
of
influence
of
the
groundwater
for
san
joaquin
but
it
is
conceivable
that
it
would.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
and
it
has
no
right
now
except
to
the
right
to
project
service
and
that
right
to
project
service
as
far
as
state
law
is
concerned
is
not
a
right
to
service
at
any
form
of
preferential
prices.
it's
simply
a
right
to
project
service
on
the
same
standing
as
other
users.
so
in
our
opinion,
the
county
of
origin
statute
and
the
area
of
origin
statute
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
any
longer,
indeed
if
they
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
it
and
the
only
question
before
the
court
really
is
whether
these
water
rights
have
been
taken
by
physical
seizure
through
the
operation
of
friant
dam
and
it
is
to
that
subject
to
which
i
would
like
to
address
the
balance
of
my
argument.
now,
the
way
in
which
a
water
right
appears
to
be
taken
by
a
seizure,
is
the
same
way
in
which
any
other
use
up
front,
is
taken
by
a
physical
seizure
or
right
to
light
or
right
to
air.
it's
when
the
united
states
demonstrates
an
intention
to
subordinate
that
right
to
the
federal
purpose
or
the
public
purpose
and
to
proceed
to
implement
that
intention
and
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
implementation
of
that
intention
actually
that
the
water
right
itself
–
excuse
me,
that
the
water
itself
be
seized
and
then
that
connection
i
point
to
gerlach
because
as
gerlach,
particularly
the
opinion
in
the
court
of
claims,
but
it
is
reflected
in
the
opinion
in
this
court
at
page
755
or
339
u.s.
the
taking
in
gerlach
was
held
to
have
been
--
to
have
occurred
on
october,
i
think
21st,
1941,
at
which
time
the
gerlach
plaintiffs
were
getting
just
as
much
water
as
they
have
ever
gotten.
the
taking
in
that
case
occurred
not
because
they
had
been
deprived
of
water,
but
because
the
united
states
had
manifested
its
intention
and
had
implemented
its
intention
by
closing
friant
dam
to
take
those
rights.
now,
of
course
the
importance
of
detention
of
water
is
that
it
may
be
evidence
indicating
the
intent
with
which
the
united
states
has
been
acting
and
that
is
referred
to
in
the
leading
case
on
this
subject,
the
portsmouth-harbor
cases
which
we
have
cited
in
our
briefs.
but
actually,
the
intent
may
be
proven
not
only
by
physical
occupation
of
the
property
involved
but
it
may
also
be
approved
in
a
number
of
other
ways,
for
example
by
express
admission
and
here,
of
course,
we
have
a
number
of
expressed
admissions.
to
take
some
of
them
just
chronologically,
we
have
the
letter
from
then
regional
director
boke
in
1947.
by
the
way,
the
record
has
a
misprint,
it
indicates
1957
which
is
obviously
incorrect,
it
was
1947
when
he
wrote
to
the
named
plaintiffs
in
the
rank
case
and
said,
it
has
been
indicated
by
some
people
that
a
taking
occurred
in
october
of
1941
and
if
you
do
not
wish
to
lose
your
rights,
you'd
better
act
on
them
before
the
sixth
anniversary
of
that
taking
date.
then
we
have
the
rowes'
letter
which
appears
in
the
record
in
volume
7
of
the
record,
pages
5
and
6.
acting
secretary
rowes
of
the
department
of
the
interior
spelled
out
again
but
he
decided
that
the
rights
be
taken
by
the
process
of
eminent
domain.
and
then
we
have
the
mckay
letter
of
1953
during
the
course
of
this
lawsuit
where
secretary
mckay
spelled
out
in
some
detail
his
plan
for
the
operation
of
the
street
and
those
two
latter
letters
set
out
the
mckay
letter
particularly
with
some
specificity
the
standard
by
which
the
stream
will
be
operated
and
that
standard
is
that
enough
water
will
be
led
through
friant
to
have
a
flow
of
five
cubic
feet
per
second
pass
the
downstream
boundary
of
each
holding
between
friant
and
i
think
it
is
gravelly
ford.
another
piece
of
evidence
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
i
conclude
from
that
letter,
sir,
that
it
has
been
unequivocal
in
declaration
of
intention
to
take
such
of
the
plaintiff's
rights
as
our
--
in
excess
of
the
amounts
necessary
to
maintain
the
five-second
foot
flow.
by
the
way
to
maintain
the
five
second
foot
flow,
it
may
take
a
good
deal
more
than
five-second
feet
through
friant.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
yes,
five-second
feet
passed
each
user.
this
is
spelled
out
in
the
settlement.
this
is
the
same
standard
as
the
settlement
contracts.
it's
rights
at
the
--
it's
five
second
feet,
past
the
downstream
boundary
of
each
holding
plus,
your
honor,
the
right
to
pump
as
the
water
goes
past
and
there
is
no
limitation
on
that
right
to
pump.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
the
--
the
court
below
--
let's
take
the
district
court
first.
the
district
court
originally
held
that
these
rights
could
not
be
taken
by
the
exercise
of
the
power
of
eminent
domain
that
for
various
reasons,
these
rights
were
in
the
reach
between
friant
and
gravelly
ford
were
exempt
from
taking.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
rights
were
not
exempted
from
taking
--
excuse
me
--
then
on
its
opinion
on
the
merits,
the
district
court
somewhat
ambiguously
indicated
that
the
rights
might
be
taken,
but
that
they
had
to
be
taken
by
the
process
of
judicial
proceedings.
then
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
held
that
the
rights
could
be
taken
in
this
without
equivocation
and
without
equivocation
that
they
could
be
taken
by
a
physical
seizure
as
well
as
by
judicial
proceedings.
but
that
in
fact
there
had
not
been
an
exercise
of
the
power
of
physical
seizure
and
my
argument
is
direct
with
the
proposition
that
in
fact
the
dist
--
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
error
when
it
said
that
the
power
of
physical
seizure
had
not
been
effectively
exercised.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
to
my
knowledge,
no.
i
have
collected
the
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
alright,
let
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
let's
go
back
a
little
bit.
what
do
you
mean
by
hurt?
if
you
mean
by
hurt
without
a
water
supply
entirely,
the
answer
is
no.
nobody
has
been
hurt
in
the
sense
that
he
has
been
actually
deprived
of
the
water
supply
that
his
land
has
been
rendered
barren
but
--
excuse
me.
if
you
mean
--
if
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
what
--
what
is
the
nature
of
the
harm?
the
harm
is
that
the
water
level
may
be
different
than
it
has
been
before.
it's
only
the
difference
between
what
would
have
been
say
by
second
--
well
actually
you
better
say
about
200
second
feet
going
pass
friant
in
2000
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
the
quantity
of
water
available
to
the
users
would
be
the
same.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
that
is
right.
now,
it
may
be
harder
and
i'll
come
to
this
in
a
moment,
it
may
be
harder
for
him
to
get
it
out
of
the
river
because
as
the
flow
is
cut
down,
the
river
meanders
away
from
the
pumps
and
so
on.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
yes,
not
--
and
not
at
his
expense,
the
government
has
consistently
offered
to
bear
the
expense
of
deepening
wells
in
the
upland
if
that's
the
way
you
want
to
get
it
or
putting
horizontal
wells
in
the
riverbed
and
so
on.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
well,
there's
been
the
taking
of
the
level.
and
that's
what
the
--
i
take
it
that's
what
the
gerlach
people
recovered
from.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
it
promised
that
the
downstream
boundary
of
each
of
these
several
hundred
holdings
in
this
area
down
to
gravelly
ford.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
yes.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
yes,
yes.
the
flow
has
to
be
much
larger.
it
varies
with
the
usage.
beae
in
mind
that
all
the
riparians
in
this
area
are
permitted
to
take
all
the
water
they
needed.
it
may
be
harder
for
them
to
get
it,
but
they're
permitted
to
take
all
the
water
that
they
need
for
riparian
users
and
indeed
so
our
appropriators.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
yes
and
as
far
as
the
actual
flows
are
concerned,
you
can
get
some
idea
of
what's
involved.
i
made
a
little
tabulation
during
the
irrigation
season,
took
the
maximums
in
june
and
in
the
minimums
in
september
and
during
the
last
five
years,
you
find
that
in
june,
the
flows
range
some
place
between
5,000
second
feet
at
friant
and
300
at
friant.
and
i
may
say
that
it
was
that
high
at
friant
presumably
because
they
were
still
making
flood
releases
in
june
or
they
may
have
been
making
a
release
to
satisfy
the
exchange
contract
along
with
gravelly
ford
due
to
a
shutdown
for
some
reasons
in
the
delta-mendota
canal.
now,
in
september,
you'll
find
that
the
flows
have
been
as
low
as
83
feet
per
second
and
as
high
as
something
in
excess
of
140.
now,
the
reasons
why
the
flows
vary
in
this
manner
through
friant
is
that
if
the
irrigation
season
progresses,
there
is
irrigation
in
the
area
largely
from
the
kings
river
as
they
are
now
indicated
in
our
map
and
that
irrigation
causes
groundwater
to
drain
into
the
river
so
that
in
some
regions
of
the
river,
it
is
a
drain
rather
than
a
source
of
supply.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
it
had
to
do
with
two
things,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
may
i
explain
the
presence
of
the
physical
solution?
the
physical
solution
is
a
form
of
conditional
decree
which
is
employed
in
cases
where
a
“would
be
appropriator”
has
no
power
of
eminent
domain
over
other
users
on
the
stream.
if
you
have
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
then
there
is
no
need
for
a
judicially
imposed
physical
solution.
if
you
don't
have
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
then
the
california
court
says,
“in
order
to
get
the
maximum
beneficial
use
out
of
the
water,
we
will
devise
a
scheme
whereby
you
as
a
private
would
be
appropriate
can
take
surplus
water
and
provide
compensation
of
appropriate
sort
to
the
other
users
on
the
stream
without
affecting
their
use”.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
yes,
compensation
in
terms
of
water.
it
might,
however,
include
compensation
in
terms
of
extra
payment
for
deepening
the
wells.
i
don't
think
it
requires
compensation
in
terms
of
delivering
actually
so
and
so
many
acre-feet
out
of
the
stream.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
yes,
yes.
the
typical
case
is
east
bay
municipal
utility
district
against
the
city
of
lodi.
the
east
bay
municipal
utility
district
is
a
district
serving
the
area
around
oakland
and
berkley
taking
water
out
of
the
river,
which
also
serve
the
small
city
of
lodi.
and
since
they
were
both
making
municipal
users
under
california
law,
the
east
bay
district
did
not
have
a
right
to
condemn
the
city's
users
and
therefore
the
court
made
this
physical
solution
so
that
both
could
live.
that's
one
aspect
of
the
physical
solution.
another
aspect
is
as
mr.
justice
white
says
that
by
putting
in
these
check
dams,
you
would
presumably
make
it
somewhat
easier
to
pump
from
the
river
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
it
didn't
affect
the
amount
--
you
mean
affect
the
amount
of
water
available
to
the
plaintiffs?
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
that
is
right.
they're
still,
even
without
the
physical
solution,
would
get
all
the
water
they
needed
plus
the
element
of
the
inconvenience
of
getting
it
from
a
meandering
stream
rather
than
behind
these
small
pool
of
a
check
dam.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
that
is
right.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
i
would
think
it
could
be
measured
just
as
much
by
changes
in
the
value
of
the
land
if
the
land
has
the
water
very
readily
available
presumably
it's
worth
more
than
if
the
water
is
somewhat
available
with
somewhat
more
difficulty
and
i
take
it
indeed
the
plaintiffs
felt
the
same
way,
i
think
as
they
were
able
to
estimate
damages,
they
filed
--
they
filed
their
tucker
act
suits
in
september
and
october
of
1947.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
yes.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
that
is
right.
the
--
a
third
aspect
of
the
physical
solution
is
that
the
district
court
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
existence
of
the
physical
solution,
the
raising
of
the
water
levels
some
--
well,
i
don't
recall
what
the
maximum
one
of
these
dams
is,
but
they're
not
very
high
say
14
or
15
feet.
but
the
raising
of
the
water
level
and
the
bed
of
the
river
would
form
enough
increase
in
pressure
to
force
more
water
into
the
underground
and
thereby
preserve
the
water
level
in
the
area
of
the
underground
influenced
by
the
river.
now,
on
that
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
that
is
in
the
back
--
in
the
back
lying
area
which
i
now
indicate.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
our
position
on
that
point
is
that,
that
the
water
levels
in
the
back
lying
area
depends
not
on
the
amount
of
water
in
the
river
but
on
the
amount
of
pumping
that
goes
on
in
that
area
and
well
i
think
i
can
illustrate
it
most
graphically
this
way.
we
had
a
geologist
on
the
stand
and
he
was
trying
to
explain
this
to
judge
hall.
he
says,
“your
honor,
if
you
don't
control
the
amount
of
pumping
in
the
area
overlying
the
groundwater,
you're
going
to
have
a
constantly
diminishing
ground
level
no
matter
how
much
water
you
put
down
the
river.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
in
the
area
which
the
court
thought,
there's
a
large
area
of
dispute
from
this
sense,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
about
what
the
river
definitely
influences
the
underground.
indeed
within
the
plus,
the
river
in
the
area
involved
here
taking
of
the
upper
regions
rather
deeply
entrenched,
maybe
200
feet
at
a
maximum.
and
in
that
entrenched
area,
there
is
open
alluvial
soil,
the
water
level
in
that
alluvial
soil
is
just
the
same
for
all
practical
purposes
as
the
water
level
in
the
river.
then
you
get
back
a
little
bit
from
the
river
and
you'll
find
the
water
level
is
somewhat
lower
than
it
is
in
the
river,
but
nevertheless
varies
to
a
degree
in
accordance
with
the
river
and
finally
as
you
get
further
back,
there
is
no
perceptible
change
at
all.
well,
based
on
the
study
of
the
groundwater
contours,
a
map
of
the
elevation
of
the
groundwater
table,
it
seems
to
the
conclusion
and
are
still
of
the
conclusion
that
the
area
affected
by
the
groundwater
--
by
the
river
is
a
relatively
narrow
band
extending
along
the
uplands
along
the
river.
now,
just
how
far
i
--
i
really
don't
recall.
the
court
took
the
position
that
the
movement
of
groundwater
depended
not
on
this
groundwater
claim
or
groundwater
table
but
on
the
fact
that
fresno
is
in
the
alluvial
cone
of
the
san
joaquin
river
and
the
district
court
set
up
the
hypothesis,
groundwater
moves
from
a
river
to
the
outermost
boundary
of
the
rivers
in
the
alluvial
cone.
fresno
was
within
the
outermost
boundary
of
the
alluvial
cone,
therefore,
water
moves
to
fresno.
we
have
resisted
that
entirely
and
one
of
our
firmest
objections
to
the
physical
solution,
your
honor,
is
this.
the
court
in
the
physical
solution
has
reserved
jurisdiction
to
alter
that
solution
in
the
event
such
alteration
becomes
necessary
and
we
say
that
the
court
is
in
effect
putting
thus
in
this
position
and
saying,
“you've
got
to
make
water
move
against
the
laws
of
nature.”
and
frankly,
i
feel
we
were
in
the
same
--
the
same
situation
as
galileo
before
the
peruvian
inquisition
except
not
only
do
we
have
to
recamp
the
heresy
or
we
have
to
make
the
earth
stop
moving
around
the
sun.
now,
we
cannot
live
with
the
situation
of
that
sort,
however,
we
recognize
that
-
and
the
districts
will
be
the
ultimate
authority
and
recognize
that
if
a
court
in
a
proper
proceeding
for
compensation
finds
that
rights
are
there
of
people
within
an
area
which
it
believe
to
be
affected
by
the
river
operations
have
been
taken.
like
it
or
not,
we
will
have
to
pay
for
it,
but
it's
quite
one
thing
to
pay
for
the
right,
buy
your
piece
and
operate
the
project
and
it's
quite
another
thing
every
summer,
you
have
to
get
up
with
the
insecurity
that,
well
today,
you're
going
to
have
to
start
releasing
the
full
natural
flow
down
the
river
and
start
drying
up
the
crops
and
drying
up
the
industries
which
are
dependent
on
the
service
of
the
canal.
it
simply
prevents
--
this
sort
of
decree
simply
prevents
the
rational
operation
of
the
friant.
thank
you.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
may
it
please
the
court.
with
regard
to
fresno
drying
government,
fresno
is
not
becoming
one
with
minivan
tire.
fresno
is
pumping
more
water
now
than
it
pumped
20
years
ago
or
12
years
ago
when
this
lawsuit
began.
they
started
out
their
pumping
around
40,000
acre-feet.
now
they're
pumping
60,000
acre-feet.
they
are
not
suffering
a
shortage
in
water
supply.
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
that's
in
addition
to
what
they
pump.
so
if
you
assume
that
fresno
needs
a
100,000
acre-feet,
when
are
they
going
to
need
it?
well,
as
i
read
--
as
i
read
the
little
table
on
page
83
of
mr.
rowe's
brief
in
number
51,
they're
not
going
to
need
that
hundred
thousand
acre-feet
until
sometime
between
1980
and
19
--
1990,
allowing
for
30,000
acre-feet
of
their
well.
so
they
have
60,000
plus
30,000
which
is
90,000
here
about
that
time.
now
--
mr.
b.
abbott
goldberg
if
they
go
ahead
and
put
in
a
system
so
they
could
get
the
water
from
friant,
they
could
turn
off
their
pumps
and
let
the
ground
water
come
back.
they'd
be
getting
60,000
and
that
would
take
their
full
supply
for
a
while.
as
the
city
engineer
who
testified,
i've
made
a
little
collection
of
these
because
i
find
them
rather
amusing,
the
city
engineer
testified
at
one
time
that
he
have
to
curtail
service
in
some
area
of
the
city.
where
it
turned
out
under
cross-examination,
he
had
to
curtail
service
not
because
there
wasn't
enough
water
there
but
there
was
so
much
demand
for
it
that
he
couldn't
get
it
through
the
existing
pipe
system.
i
refer
to
five
record
at
page
2179,
but
what
concerns
me
is
this
100,000
acre-feet
and
actually
the
impact
of
judge
goldberg's
question,
because
the
problem
is
this.
you
can't
say,
you
can't
say
for
the
city
of
fresno
or
for
anybody
else,
you're
going
to
need
a
100,000
acre-feet
in
the
future.
you
could
only
say
you're
going
to
need
100,000
acre-feet
if
present
conditions
of
growth,
patterns
of
growth
continue
and
these
projects
have
to
be
kept
elastic
and
you
have
a
splendid
demonstration
of
the
last
or
future
project
here.
the
original
feature
is
friant,
delta-mendota
canal,
madera
canal,
friant-kern
it's
just
the
way
up
here
in
the
north
the
best
dam,
the
most
feasible
one
built
first,
tracy
pumping
system.
now,
the
next
dam,
the
next
most
feasible
one
was
the
american
shortly
north
of
sacramento
up
here
on
poso
dams
on
the
america.
so
they
built
that.
this
water
supply
is
a
constantly
expanding
thing
when
fresno
says
in
page
--
i
think
its
page
52
and
so
of
their
buff
reply
brief,
i
identify
it
as
buffed
because
there
are
two
of
them
in
51.
may
i
continue
for
just
a
moment,
when
they
say
that
they
have
no
source
of
supply
except
from
the
san
joaquin
river
sir,
that
is
not
correct?
they
have
a
source
of
supply
from
the
central
valley
project.
they
indeed
what
have
a
source
supply
from
the
state
project
which
will
be
coming
on
the
west
side
if
they
chose
to
use
it.
the
fight
is
not
over,
source
of
water,
availability
of
water,
it's
over
the
price
that's
going
to
have
to
be
paid.
thank
you.
