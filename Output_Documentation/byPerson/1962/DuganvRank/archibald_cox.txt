mr.
archibald
cox
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
one
of
three
cases
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
all
growing
out
of
a
single
action
brought
against
the
united
states
and
officials
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
the
central
issue
is
whether
the
action
in
all
its
aspects
is
in
reality,
a
suit
against
the
united
states
barred
by
sovereign
immunity.
our
position
is
that
it
is
such
an
action
and
is
so
barred
and
that
the
plaintiffs
have
a
remedy
for
damages
under
the
tucker
act
in
a
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
but
they're
not
--
but
they're
not
entitled
to
this
action
for
a
specific
relief
under
the
doctrine
of
the
larson
case
and
malone
and
bowdoin.
the
justices,
who
were
on
the
court
at
the
time
of
the
gerlach
and
ivanhoe
cases,
will
recall
the
complexity
and
grandeur
of
the
central
valley
project.
the
north
half
of
the
central
valley
in
california,
the
sacramento
valley,
has
a
surplus
of
water.
the
south
half,
the
san
joaquin
valley,
has
a
shortage
of
water.
the
purpose
of
the
project,
the
essence
was
to
improve
the
use
of
water
in
both
halves
of
the
valley,
but
also
particularly
to
bring
surplus
down
to
the
water
hungry
regions
in
the
san
joaquin.
for
present
purposes,
there
are
only
two
units
of
the
project
that
are
important
to
us.
both
were
the
key
units
in
the
sense.
the
san
joaquin
river
rises
in
the
sierras
in
the
area
just
south
of
the
yosemite
and
then
flows
southwesterly
and
breaks
through
the
mountains
here
at
friant.
then
it
continues
on,
flowing
a
little
bit
more
to
the
west
and
then
take
a
sharp
bend
up
to
the
northwest
and
it
--
in
the
delta
area,
it
joins
the
sacramento
and
the
two
flow
out
through
the
golden
gate
to
the
sea.
the
first
unit
that
we're
concerned
with
is
the
friant
dam
which
was
built
right
here
where
the
river
breaks
through
the
mountains
and
behind
which
is
millerton
lake,
a
storage
reservoir.
extending
from
that
dam
north
is
the
madera
canal
and
south
the
friant-kern
canal,
which
transports
water
to
regions
that
otherwise,
would
be
shortage
areas.
and
they
take,
when
the
dam
is
close,
all
or
virtually
all
the
water
of
the
san
joaquin.
the
irrigation
district
which
are
the
petitioners
in
the
third
case
to
be
heard
today
are
the
districts
that
are
furnished
by
these
two
canals,
one
runs
about
50
miles
and
the
other
about
150.
now
closing
the
friant
dam
and
diverting
the
water
via
the
canal
would
of
course
unless
something
else
was
done,
cut
off
the
irrigation
water
available
to
the
lower
san
joaquin
valley.
to
take
care
of
that,
we
have
the
second
significant
unit
in
the
project
here,
the
delta-mendota
canal
which
runs
from
the
delta
where
it
hooks
on
to
the
sacramento
river,
comes
to
the
pumping
plant
of
tracy
and
is
then
raised
and
closed
by
gravity
down
here
to
a
place
called
mendota
pool.
there
it
is
released
and
flows
back
up
north
again
and
water
these
lands,
which
previously
received
water
of
the
san
joaquin
river.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
there
are
maps
in
the
briefs.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
should
think
we
could
a
quickly
--
we've
tried
certainly
as
quickly
as
we
can
give,
yes.
and
i
think
there's
another
that
i'm
sure
i
can
obtain
copies
of
that
are
somewhat
easier
than
the
brief.
it
was
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
certainly
will,
yes,
except
for
getting
it
reproduced
if
we
have
to.
we
left
--
which
way
to
do
it.
we
will
try
to
get
it
reproduced
and
then
return
this
along
with
the
reproduction.
you
will
notice
of
course
that
since
the
delta-mendota
canal
comes
only
to
mendota
pool,
this
would
mean
that
if
friant
dam
were
closed
completely,
this
area
on
which
i've
marked
with
red
running
from
friant
dam
down
to
mendota
pool
would
be
without
water
and
that
is
the
area
that
we're
concerned
with
in
this
case.
the
diversion
of
the
natural
flow
at
the
san
joaquin
having
made
no
provision
from
those
lands
in
the
red
area,
gave
rise
to
a
problem
that
the
reclamation
bureau
and
the
united
states
of
course
have
to
face.
some
of
the
water
rights
in
that
area,
indeed,
most
of
the
water
rights
in
that
area
were
required
under
state
law.
we
entered
into
contracts
either
buying
the
rights
or
contracts
to
supply
them
with
water
or
agreed
a
partial
arrangement
to
supply
some
water
and
to
make
some
payment.
a
minority
of
the
land
owners
and
the
united
states
were
unable
to
grip
--
to
agree
and
this
suit
resulted.
the
water
rights
asserted
by
the
plaintiffs
were
of
three
kinds,
some
of
the
plaintiffs
whose
land
actually
along
the
river
claimed
riparian
rights
which
california
still
recognizes
to
a
degree.
the
united
states
has
always
acknowledged
some
interference
with
those
riparian
rights.
it
claims
to
have
taken
them
to
the
extent
that
there
is
interference
and
it
denies
the
full
amount
of
the
interference
that
the
plaintiffs
claim.
some
of
the
plaintiffs
claim
what
are
known
as
overlying
rights
to
the
underground
waters
which
they
claim
were
fed
by
the
san
joaquin
river.
they
were
mostly
in
this
area,
south
of
the
river,
barely
reaching
to
the
city
of
fresno.
the
united
states,
for
the
most
part,
denies
that
it
has
interfered
with
the
overlying
rights
to
the
extent
that
they
have
been
impaired,
again,
we
claim
to
have
taken
it.
some
of
the
plaintiffs
--
i
might
--
i
should
say
too
that
the
city
of
fresno
has
been
spoken
off
for
the
most
part
as
being
in
the
category
of
the
owner
of
overlying
rights.
finally,
some
of
the
plaintiffs
claim
appropriative
rights
that
is
to
say
they
are
not
neither
overlying
land
owners
nor
riparian
but
they
claim
to
have
taken
water
and
put
it
to
beneficial
use
in
time
to
have
acquired
rights
under
california
water
law.
the
action
was
brought
by
the
plaintiffs
against
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes,
subject
to
only
one
--
subject
to
one
possible
qualification
and
i
don't
--
we
don't
have
enough
facts
to
say
how
much
the
qualification
it
is,
but
some
of
them
may
now
be
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitation,
although
most
of
them
have
already
brought
their
suits
and
were
not
barred
by
the
statute,
but
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
that
there
was
nobody
who
might
be
barred
by
the
statute.
but
we
acknowledge
to
the
extent
we'd
interfered
that
there
clearly
--
we
were
clearly
bound
to
recognize
the
rights
under
state
law
to
that
extent,
if
we
have
to
take
them,
we
couldn't
just
wipe
them
out,
and
that
that
gave
rise
to
an
obligation
to
pay.
so
the
real
issue
here
isn't
one
of
the
obligation
to
pay,
it's
to
whether
they
can
tie
up
the
project
as
a
way
of
asserting
their
rights.
the
action
was
brought
against
officials
of
the
reclamation
bureau
to
seek
what
is
called
a
physical
solution
of
the
plaintiff's
originally
riparian
rights.
under
california
law,
a
riparian
or
overlying
owner
who
can
show
that
other
people
on
the
stream
are
interfering
with
the
natural
flow
of
the
water,
may
obtain
a
decree
restraining
interference
with
the
flow
of
the
stream
unless
the
junior
appropriator
at
his
own
expense
make
some
physical
arrangements
which
will
protect
the
superior
right
of
the
riparian
owner
to
water
to
a
reasonable
extent.
for
example
in
the
present
case,
which
is
as
good
as
an
example
of
a
physical
solution
as
any,
the
district
court
enjoined
the
operation
of
friant
dam.
they
said
you
can't
use
friant
dam
and
required
the
reclamation
bureau
to
release
all
the
waters
of
the
san
joaquin
river
unless
the
united
states
build
a
series
of
10
more
dams
and
operated
them
in
the
manner
that
the
district
court
required,
describing
the
dams
in
great
detail
even
down
to
gantry
trains
and
the
size
of
rails
of
the
train
should
run
on
and
so
forth,
and
it
provided
that
there
should
be
a
specified
flow
of
water
over
the
last
dam.
the
individual
defendants
when
the
suit
started,
moved
to
dismiss
upon
various
grounds,
but
especially
on
the
ground
that
the
action
was
in
reality,
one
against
the
united
states
barred
under
the
doctrine
of
the
larson
case.
when
that
motion
was
denied,
the
officials
made
a
number
of
answers,
including
answers
on
the
merits
but
they
preserve
the
position
which
we
insist
upon
here
at
all
times
that
this
was
an
unconsented
to
suit
against
the
united
states.
the
district
court
found
against
the
reclamation
official,
both
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
on
the
merits.
it
entered
a
decree
which
as
i
have
said,
enjoined
the
operation
of
friant
dam,
enjoined
the
transfer
of
water
through
the
madera
and
friant-kern
canals
unless
the
united
states
which
it
recognized
would
have
to
go
in,
chose
to
build
10
additional
dams
on
the
strip
of
the
river
down
the
gravelly
ford
at
an
expense
of
somewhere
around
a
million
dollars.
i
must
now
i
think
for
the
purposes
of
clarification,
turn
to
a
second
aspect
of
the
case
in
the
district
court.
the
city
of
fresno
was
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
original
action
seeking
protection
of
what
fresno
said
were
her
overlying
rights
to
the
underground
waters
alleged
by
her
but
denied
by
us
as
coming
from
the
san
joaquin.
at
this
stage
when
fresno
came
in,
the
united
states
was
joined
as
a
defendant
or
at
least
attempted
to
be
joined
because
the
united
states
never
appeared.
in
addition,
fresno
filed
a
separate
complaint
and
intervention
against
both
the
reclamation
bureau
officials
and
the
united
states
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
her
right
to
take
additional
water
from
the
san
joaquin
river
from
the
natural
flow
was
superior
to
any
rights
of
the
united
states
to
the
waters
of
the
san
joaquin
because
we
had
acquired
assignments
of
rights
to
the
waters
of
the
san
joaquin
from
the
state
of
california.
third,
fresno
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
united
states
was
obliged
to
furnish
fresno
with
water
from
millerton
lake
behind
friant
dam
at
the
price
of
350
an
acre
foot,
although
the
price
charged
to
all
other
municipalities
for
water
under
the
central
valley
project
is
higher
and
ranges
up
but
not
above
$10
of
acre
foot.
the
district
court
gave
judgment
against
the
untied
states
on
both
these
claims
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
as
to
the
united
states,
holding
that
there
was
an
unconsented
suit
against
the
united
states
and
the
city
of
fresno
by
the
petition
in
number
51,
the
second
case
to
be
argued
today,
brought
that
ruling
here.
with
respect
to
the
original
suit,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
judgment
in
favor
of
the
riparian
overlying
owners
so
far
as
the
individual
defendants
were
concerned.
it
held
it
was
not
an
action
--
really
an
action
against
the
united
states
because
it
fell
within
the
exception
which
permits
its
said
suits
against
officers
of
the
united
states
where
they
are
acting
outside
of
the
scope
of
their
authority
and
committing
a
tort
against
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
archibald
cox
fresno
is
a
plaintiff
in
that
suit.
so
that
fresno
really
has
three
claims.
it
has
--
it's
in
common
with
all
the
overlying
owners
and
riparian
owners.
it
has
its
claim
that
it's
entitled
to
a
declaration
that
it
has
a
right
to
appropriate
water
out
of
the
natural
flow
ahead
of
any
rights
of
the
united
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
number
51
here
and
it
has
a
declaration
which
is
also
in
number
51
that
it's
entitled
to
water
at
350
an
acre
foot.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
--
on
the
reclamation
bureau's
petition
to
which
i'm
going
to
address
myself
now,
we
submit
that
the
courts
below
both
erred
in
failing
to
dismiss
the
action
as
an
unconsented
to
a
suit
against
the
united
states.
certainly,
it
is
such
a
suit
in
every
substantial
respect.
the
bureau
officials
were
sued
only
to
control
their
action
as
officers
of
the
united
states.
the
complaint
sought
not
damages,
but
an
injunctive
decree,
granting
specific
relief.
under
the
decree,
either
friant
dam
must
stand
idle,
the
great
works
unused,
no
water
flowing
either
north
or
south
through
the
madera
canal
or
the
friant-kern
canal
and
no
water
supplied
to
the
irrigation
district
or
else,
under
--
excuse
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
you
agree
with
this
in
this
position,
there
is
nothing
left
to
decide.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
--
well,
we
would
have
a
--
we
would
have
essentially
the
same
position
but
the
reasoning
is
a
little
different.
in
51,
we
claim,
it's
a
suit
against
the
united
states
and
indeed
we
think
it's
obviously
is
and
the
question
there
is
whether
the
only
question
so
far
as
i
can
see
is
whether
the
united
states
has
given
its
consent.
there
is
an
argument
that
the
united
states
has
consented
to
be
sued
and
i
suppose
that
if
that
argument
is
good,
it
really
takes
care
of
31
too.
so
i
guess
that
the
court
has
to
decide
a
minimum
of
two
points.
one
whether
larson
and
malone
and
bowdoin
are
decisive
in
that
general
principle,
and
second,
whether
section
206
(a)
of
an
act
of
1950
known
as
the
mccarren
amendment,
gives
consent
to
suits
against
the
united
states.
i
was
saying
that
the
decree
that
this
suit
was
in
substance
against
the
united
states
either
it
expends
itself
on
these
key
units
of
the
central
valley
project
and
prevents
its
operation
or
in
the
alternative,
it
compels
the
united
states
and
this
is
submitted
to
build
10
more
dams
on
the
river
which
have
not
been
approved
by
the
reclamation
bureau
and
which
have
not
been
authorize
and
for
which
no
money
has
been
appropriated
by
congress.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
order
--
in
a
suit
against
united
states,
there's
no
such
case,
no
such
case.
as
among
private
parties
in
california
law
there's
present,
but
i
know
of
no
case
anyone
near
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
when
they
put
up
the
dam
and
flood
the
house,
they
have
condemned
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
very
effect
of
putting
up
--
well,
if
the
project
is
unauthorized,
if
the
reclamation
bureau
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
it's
authorized
then
as
in
the
gerlach
case
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
he
is
authorized
he
can't
be
a
trespasser,
no.
i
think
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there's
no
such
--
there's
no
permitted
suit
against
an
official
of
the
government
acting
within
his
authority.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
lesson
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
government
--
the
government
when
it
builds
the
dam
cuts
off
the
rights
does
condemn
as
it
did
in
gerlach.
that
was
the
holding
of
the
court
in
gerlach.
similarly
in
many
flowing
cases,
the
government
when
it
erects
a
dam
or
locks
and
it
flows
the
land
behind,
that
flowing
constitutes
a
taking
then
and
there
and
an
action
will
lie
for
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
under
the
tucker
act,
yes.
this
at
far
is
a
remedy,
but
at
the
same
time,
it
permits
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
the
government
to
go
forward
with
the
work.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
the
–
true,
but
the
dickenson
case
i
think
indicates
that
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
barring
of
this
cause
of
action
if
there
is
genuine
uncertainty
or
lack
of
knowledge
as
to
whether
there
really
has
been
an
occasion
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
same
was
true
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
a
man
could
show
that
in
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
you
see,
the
essence
have
--
i
think
there
was
clearly
some
taking
and
the
--
and
we
--
there
was
no
taking
by
judicial
proceeding.
it
was
the
kind
of
taking
that
there
was
in
the
gerlach
case
and
there
was
clearly
some
taking.
now
there
is
some
dispute
and
has
been
from
the
beginning
as
to
just
how
much
of
this
underground
water
was
affected
by
the
closing
of
friant
dam.
we
don't
say
there
was
a
taking
to
the
--
as
to
those
parts
which
we
claim
were
not
affected.
on
the
other
hand,
we
say
anything
that
was
affected
was
clearly
taken
just
as
it
was
in
the
gerlach
case
and
that
the
issue
as
to
where
that
line
is
cannot
be
tried
out
in
a
suit
to
interfere
with
the
operation
of
the
project
because
we
think
these
officials
clearly
acted
within
their
authority
as
between
principle
and
aging
when
they
constructed
the
dam.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
trial
court
held
that
there
was
no
taking.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
court
of
appeals
held
we
had
authority
to
take
but
that
there
was
no
taking.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there
could
be
no
taking
unless
one
were
more
precise
in
telling
the
plaintiffs
exactly
what
had
been
taken.
now
we
say
as
to
that
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
there
was
a
taking
or
not.
well,
we
really
say
three
things
mr.
justice
black.
we
say
first
that
there
was
a
taking
and
we
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
case
in
terms
of
could
anyone
in
this
area
sue
the
united
states
for
a
taking
under
the
gerlach
case
the
answer
would
unquestionably
be
yes,
and
that
if
there
was
a
taking
for
that
purpose,
it
was
a
taking
for
the
purposes
of
our
case.
second,
we
say
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
there
was
a
taking
or
not
or
exactly
how
much
was
taken
at
this
day
because
of
the
doctrine
of
the
larson
case
and
malone
and
bowdoin,
because
here
certainly,
these
defendants
were
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
authority.
they
were
--
i
think
the
confusion
arises
from
the
term
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
authority.
it's
possible
for
example
to
say
that
well,
the
officer
in
the
forest
service
that
no
officer
of
the
forest
service
is
authorized
to
take
somebody
else's
land
and
to
oust
them
from
possession
and
to
claim
under
avoid
these.
if
one
has
it
as
a
known
and
indisputable
truth
that
he
is
taking
land
that
belongs
to
someone
else
and
that
he
knows
that
and
knows
the
deed
to
be
void
and
then
i
suppose
he
is
acting
outside
the
scope
of
his
authority.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
of
course
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
i
was
simply
using
this
for
illustrative
purpose,
but
he
is
authorized
to
determine
what
land
he
thinks
belongs
to
the
united
states
in
his
best
judgment.
that's
what
the
united
states
sets
him
up
to
do,
and
when
he
makes
that
decision
of
whether
he
is
right
or
wrong
does
not
destroy
his
authority
and
that's
the
reason
that
the
action
for
rejectment
wouldn't
lie
in
the
--
in
malone
and
bowdoin,
similarly
in
the
larson
case.
i
take
it
that
everyone
would
agree
that
larson,
the
war
assets
administrator
wasn't
authorized
to
sell
called
as
a,
and
then
knowing
he'd
sold
it
to
a
and
the
title
had
passed,
he
is
obligated
to
make
delivery
to
sell
it
to
b,
but
on
the
other
hand,
he
was
authorized
to
superintend
the
administration
of
contracts
and
to
interpret
them
and
provided
he
acts
in
his
good
judgment
and
perhaps
not
capriciously,
his
decision
is
not
placed
outside
his
authority
because
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
not
--
i
think
it's
very
--
it's
gone
very
largely
in
a
case
where
an
action
rely
under
the
tucker
act
and
that
malone
and
bowdoin
shows
there
is
no
special
protection
for
land
cases
and
the
larson
case
that
dealt
with
chattel.
now
here,
in
this
situation,
the
officers
of
the
court
below
held,
were
authorized
to
take
these
any
water
rights
necessary
or
to
take
any
land
necessary
for
this
project.
they
were
also
certainly
authorized
to
operate
the
dam
and
to
interfere
with
the
natural
flow
where
it
didn't
interfere
with
anyone's
rights.
those
were
judgments
that
they
were
empowered
to
make.
whether
they
made
some
mistake
in
them,
may
have
resulted
in
their
committing
a
tort
but
it
did
not
deprive
them
of
the
authority
to
act.
and
really,
the
holding
of
the
court
below
and
the
plaintiff's
argument
it
seems
to
me,
comes
down
into
a
contention
that
this
special
category
of
cases
still
exists
that
an
officer
of
the
united
states
may
be
enjoined
when
he
has
been
committing
a
common
law
tort.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
just
going
to
say
that
that
category
of
case
was
held
nonexistent
in
larson
that
that
is
not
ground
for
suing
an
officer
of
the
united
states
and
that
if
there
could
be
any
doubt
after
larson
as
apparently
there
was
because
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
bowdoin
case
and
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
rendered
inconsistent
decision,
they
were
set
straight
in
bowdoin
so
far
as
the
fifth
circuit
is
concerned.
frankly,
i
can't
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
would
have
decided
this
case
it
did
had
malone
and
bowdoin
been
available
to
it
at
that
time.
yes
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
didn't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
there
was
a
period
when
it
was
operated
under
consent
decrees.
the
friant
dam
was
built.
the
water
districts
are
being
served.
in
the
point
of
fact,
the
government's
arrangement
with
some
of
the
owners
of
between
friant
dam
and
gravelly
ford,
the
area
we're
concerned,
because
we
acquired
all
of
these
rights
below
--
below
gravelly
ford,
the
government
entered
into
an
arrangement
with
a
number
of
owners,
saying
that
it
would
let
them
specified
quantities
of
water
up
to
5-cubic
feet
a
second
regularly
and
it
entered
into
arrangements
with
them
to
build
channels,
but
encompass
to
make
other
things.
so
as
a
result
of
the
settlement
a
cert
--
with
the
people
who
aren't
here,
a
certain
amount
of
water
has
been
going
down.
we
think
indeed
that
this
is
hardly
disputed
and
the
court
found
against
us,
we
think
indeed
that's
enough
to
take
care
of
all
the
riparian
rights.
the
owners
of
overlying
rights
are
still
pumping
water.
the
water
table
is
going
down
in
their
view
and
in
the
district
court's
view.
this
is
a
result
of
what
we've
done
with
friant
dam.
in
our
view,
it
isn't
the
result
of
that
at
all.
of
course,
we
can't
argue
that
issue
here
and
i
mentioned
it
only
to
find
out
what
we're
objecting
to
is
trying
that
issue
not
in
the
tucker
act
suit
where
it
belongs
but
in
an
action
that
plainly
expends
itself
on
the
property
and
treasury
of
the
united
states.
now
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
within
the
project
disapproved
by
the
congress.
this
specific
incidents,
were
described
during
the
'50s,
the
exact
reference
is
there
in
my
brief.
mr.
archibald
cox
two
of
the
congress
and
the
congress
voted
appropriation
to
make
settlements
with
those
fellows
that
we've
settled
with
downstream.
they
know
exactly
what
we
were
doing.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
you
have
to
mention
it
both
in
ivanhoe
and
particularly
in
gerlach
because
you
remember
in
gerlach
where
it's
right
down
here
on
san
joaquin.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
summary,
because
i'm
afraid
i
jumped
around
a
bit.
let
me
simply
state
the
three
objections
to
the
decree
of
the
narrative
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
i've
tried
to
refer
to.
first,
we
think
there
was
a
taking
and
that
will
prevent
issue
of
being
argued
by
the
irrigation
district
and
it
may
be
that
in
the
fresno
case,
i'll
have
some
time
to
refer
to
it.
second,
we
say
even
if
there
wasn't
to
take,
even
if
there's
uncertainty
as
to
what
was
taken
and
what
was
interfered
with
and
what
wasn't
interfered
with
at
all
that
the
action
is
in
reality
one
against
the
united
states
because
the
gist
of
the
claim
is
that
this
was
a
tort
and
we
deny
the
tort,
that's
an
issue
that
can't
be
tried
out,
we
say,
in
this
kind
of
action.
and
cert
--
mr.
archibald
cox
not
if
it
was
simply
a
tort.
mr.
archibald
cox
clearly
not
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
it's
so
little
of
a
tort
is
not
to
amount
to
a
taking,
yes.
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
find
it
very
difficult
if
there
was
such
a
thing
to
tell
you
the
truth,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
either
we
did
one
--
either
we
took
or
we
didn't
affect
it
at
all,
but
i
think
in
theory
if
there
is
a
zone
in
between
which
the
government
has
never
been
very
successful
in
tucker
act
cases
in
arguing
that
there
was
and
i'm
quite
correct
in
my
judgment,
if
there
is
a
zone
in
between,
there
would
be
no
remedy.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
would
be
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
archibald
cox
but
we're
not
arguing
that
--
we're
not
arguing
that
tucker
act
should
be
so
narrowly
construed
here.
we're
objecting
to
the
specific
relief.
the
third
point
if
i
might
take
the
30
seconds,
the
third
point
that
we
say
is
that
both
the
majority
and
dissenting
opinions
in
larson,
say
that
even
where
an
officer
has
been
acting
outside
its
authority
that
if
the
decree
would
compel
affirmative
action
by
the
united
states
or
expend
itself
upon
the
property
of
the
united
states,
then
the
action
for
the
injunction
will
not
lie
and
we
think
this
case
falls
for
reasons
stated
in
our
brief
from
that
category.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
interfered
with
some
flow
of
water
or
we
didn't
interfere
with
it,
one
or
the
other.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
was
no
ground
for
an
injunction.
of
course
that
took
--
mr.
archibald
cox
right
and
that
that's
the
proper
place
without
interfering
with
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
might
be
most
helpful
if
i
spent
my
time
treating
these
cases
as
run
together
dealing
with
three
topics.
first,
it
might
be
helpful
to
describe
again,
exactly
what
was
the
judgment
that
fresno
got
in
the
district
court
which
is
before
this
court.
second,
i
want
to
deal
with
an
argument
which
mr.
rowe
makes
in
his
brief
and
which
impressed
judge
peirson
hall
in
the
district
court
although
it
was
rejected
by
the
circuit
court
to
which
that
we
had
consented.
and
third,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
the
county
of
origin
and
watershed
statutes.
now
fresno
obtained
under
the
district
court
judgment,
three
things.
first
is
an
allegedly
overlying
owner.
it
obtained
an
injunction
against
the
reclamation
bureau
of
fisheries
and
the
united
states
enjoining
the
operation
of
friant
dam
as
a
great
work,
carrying
water
north
and
south.
as
to
that
issue,
the
united
states
was
dismissed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
is
to
say
the
judgment
was
reversed
as
to
us
and
the
question
would
be
whether
we
consented
and
whether
the
action
against
the
individual
defendants
can
be
maintained
and
i
dealt
pretty
much
with
the
second
of
those
points.
the
second
thing
that
fresno
got
was
a
declaratory
judgment
really
against
the
united
states
and
only
the
united
states
in
this
respect
to
the
effect
that
its
right
to
make
future
appropriations
of
water
from
the
prime
--
from
the
san
joaquin
river.
this
isn't
its
right
as
an
overlying
--
this
is
making
appropriations
out
of
the
river,
was
superior
to
any
water
rights
the
united
states
might
get
in
the
river
and
that
seems
to
me
clearly
and
indisputably
to
be
a
judgment
against
the
united
states
and
only
the
united
states.
the
third
thing
that
fresno
got
is
a
declaration
and
i
guess
an
injunction
saying
that
fresno
was
entitled
to
water
--
it
was
entitled
not
to
have
the
natural
flow
of
the
stream
interfered
with
unless
she
got
water
from
the
project
at
350
and
in
effect,
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
declaration
that
the
united
states
or
somebody
must
furnish
affirmatively
property
of
the
united
states
at
this
price
and
i
really
see
no
escape
from
the
proposition
that
that
is
a
judgment
against
the
united
states
and
clearly
wants
to
be
dismissed
unless
we
have
consented.
now
there
is
at
this
stage,
really
no
dispute
about
fresno
getting
water.
her
contract
for
water
from
the
project
covers
all
the
water
that
fresno
can
possibly
use
within
the
intermediate
to
run
future.
there
is
a
testimony
that
fresno
might
someday
have
uses
in
demands
in
excess
of
this
contract.
but
for
the
present,
as
soon
as
she
builds
the
necessary
work,
she
will
get
all
the
water
she
can
use
for
some
time.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
would
be
for
the
pro
--
from
the
project.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
but
that
won't
be
indefinitely
enough.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
it
wouldn't
be
enough
even
if
it
didn't
go
down.
it
wouldn't
be
enough
even
if
it
didn't
go
down
and
her
effort
to
get
the
declaratory
judgment
relates
to
getting
water
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
wells
wouldn't
supply
from
the
--
well,
either
from
the
natural
flow
or
from
the
project.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
a
practical
matter,
it
is
for
the
--
it
is
for
the
short
for
the
intermediate
run
future.
the
amounts
are
covered
in
the
contract.
it's
--
and
her
needs
won't
exceed
those
for
long.
mr.
archibald
cox
we've
signed
the
contract
to
give
and
that
the
contract
fixing
its
price
of
course
not
subject
to
the
determination
of
the
price
by
this
court
but
subject
to
the
decree
in
this
case.
that
is
to
say
the
price
is
fixed
unless
they
win
this
case
and
then
they
get
whatever
--
so
they
didn't
give
up
any
litigation
rights
they
had.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
run
--
it's
a
sliding
scale.
it
isn't
that
different
municipalities
get
different
prices
but
it
depends
on
a
number
of
factors
as
to
how
much
water
you
take
when
it
runs
up
to
1050.
fresno
would
be
treated
uniformly
as
i
understand
it
with
all
other
cities
taking
water
from
the
central
valley
project.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
--
mr.
archibald
cox
she
wants
to
get
it
at
the
rate
that
we
supply
to
irrigate
it.
the
cities,
the
municipalities
are
the
formula
applicable
to
them
that
charges
a
higher
rate
and
i'll
show
the
statutory
authority
for
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no
sir,
no
sir.
and
this
map
is
intended
to
have
the
main
feature
showing
this
area.
it
was
--
it
wasn't
really
made
even
for
the
purposes
of
the
case
which
seem
to
me
would
be
helpful,
but
i
--
i'm
willing
to
conceive
for
present
purposes
that
this
watershed
is
a
different
watershed
for
this
one.
i
don't
think
we
need
to
argue
with
this
one.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
it's
--
well
our
position
--
may
i
postpone
answering
that
question.
i
do
mean
to
deal
with
it,
but
i
think
that
it
would
be
better
to
deal
with
it
a
little
more
length
than
trying
to
deal
with
it
halfway
now.
since
the
one
common
question
probably
to
all
three
suits
is
whether
the
united
states
has
consented
to
be
sued,
i
want
to
deal
with
that
first
and
then
i
will
come
to
the
county
of
origin
and
watershed
legislation.
judge
hall
said
that
we
had
consented
to
be
sued
because
of
the
statute
that
appears
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief
in
number
51.
that's
the
city
of
fresno
case.
you'll
note
that
it
provides
the
consent
is
hereby
given
to
join
the
united
states
as
a
defendant
in
any
suit
for
the
adjudication
of
rights
to
the
use
of
water
of
a
river
system
or
other
source
or
for
the
administration
of
such
right,
where
it
appears
the
united
states
is
the
owner
of
or
is
in
the
process
of
acquiring
water
rights
by
appropriation
under
state
law
and
the
united
states
as
a
necessary
party
to
such
suit.
it
is
our
view
that
that
statute
has
no
application
because
it
applies
only
to
a
particular
class
of
litigation
to
the
well-known
suit
in
western
water
law
for
the
general
adjudication
of
all
rights
in
a
river
system
that
it
does
not
apply
as
a
reverse
to
suits
by
some
owners
on
the
stream
against
the
united
states
to
enjoin
the
united
states
from
interfering
with
their
water
rights.
i
rely
really
on
three
lines
of
argument.
the
first
deals
with
words.
you
will
note
that
the
statute
does
not
give
permission
to
sue
the
united
states.
it
gives
permission
to
join
the
united
states
as
a
defendant
and
thus
implying
that
there
will
be
other
real
defendants
whose
interests
are
diverse
to
the
united
states
imply
normally
other
private
parties.
this
certainly
is
consistent
with
the
notion
of
this
being
a
special
kind
of
well
known
suit.
second,
it
speaks
of
a
suit
for
the
adjudication
of
rights
to
the
use
of
water
--
of
a
river
system
or
other
source.
it's
not
all
suits
dealing
with
the
interference
of
right
--
with
water
rights
or
alleged
trespassory
conduct.
it's
suits
for
the
adjudication
of
rights
and
we
think
it
means
all
rights
to
the
use
of
water
from
a
river
system.
and
then
finally
over
on
the
top
of
page
3,
it
again
speaks
of
a
case
in
which
the
united
states
is
a
necessary
party
and
we
think
this
confirms
our
reading
because
of
the
obvious
fairness
of
not
having
when
the
united
states
has
acquired
a
great
many
water
rights
on
western
streams,
of
not
having
the
whole
class
of
suits
for
the
general
adjudication
of
rights
preceded
by
the
fact
that
you
can't
join
the
united
states.
so
the
statute
says,
where
you
have
a
suit
like
that,
the
united
states
is
a
necessary
party
then
you
can
join
them.
in
addition
to
the
words,
we
rely
very
strongly
on
the
legislative
history.
in
this
course
of
the
senate
report
describing
this
bill,
the
report
quotes
at
some
length
from
the
decision
of
this
court
in
pacific
live
stock
company
against
oregon
water
board
and
the
passage
that
it
quotes
is
describing
the
kind
of
suit
that
the
statute
deals
with
is
described
in
this
way.
all
claimants
are
required
to
appear
and
prove
their
claims.
no
one
could
refuse
without
forfeiting
his
claim
and
all
have
the
same
relation
to
the
proceeding.
it
is
intended
to
be
universal
and
to
result
in
a
complete
ascertainment
of
all
existing
rights
to
the
end
first
that
the
water
maybe
distributed
among
all
lawful
claimants.
second,
that
the
rights
of
all
maybe
evidenced
by
appropriate
certificates
and
third
that
the
amount
of
surplus
or
unclaimed
water
maybe
made
available
to
appropriate
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
this?
i
was
reading
from
page
16
of
our
brief
in
number
51.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
the
--
two
of
the
committee
reports
that
i
just
quoted
as
it
quoted
a
prior
decision
of
this
court
explaining
the
kind
of
suit,
there's
a
test
correspondence
between
senator
magnuson
and
senator
mccarran
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
committee
and
author
of
the
bill.
and
while
i
hesitate
to
read,
i
think
this
is
so
directly
in
point,
i'm
going
to
take
liberty.
senator
magnuson
said
and
he
had
some
foresight.
i
visualize
the
possibility
of
an
individual
group,
an
individual
or
group
having
water
rights
on
that
stream
bringing
suit
to
adjudicate
their
respective
rights
thereby
preventing
the
bureau
of
reclamation
from
going
ahead
with
the
--
hells
canyon
project
while
litigation
is
in
the
process
pending.
such
action
of
the
part
of
the
appropriators
might
be
taken
on
their
own
initiative
or
might
be
stimulated
by
third
parties
who
are
opposing
this
development.
and
then
he
went
on
and
said
if
that
isn't
the
purpose,
we
ought
to
make
this
clear
in
the
committee
report
or
some
similar
way
by
legislative
history.
senator
mccarran
wrote
back
s-18,
speaking
the
bill
that
became
the
law
that
i
was
dealing
with,
is
not
intended
to
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
obstructing
the
project
to
which
you
speak
or
any
similar
project
and
it
is
not
intended
to
be
used
for
any
other
purpose
then
to
allow
the
united
states
to
be
joined
where
in
it
is
necessary
to
adjudicate
all
the
rights
of
various
owners
on
a
given
stream.
this
is
so
because
unless
all
the
parties
owning
on
process
of
acquiring
water
rights
on
a
particular
stream
can
be
joined
as
party
defendants
and
a
subsequent
decree
would
be
of
little
value
which
fits
right
in
with
the
words
i
think.
i
agree
with
you
that
for
the
purposes
of
legislative
history
the
report
should
show
that
s-18
is
not
intended
to
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
obstructing
or
delaying
bureau
of
reclamation
project
for
the
good
of
the
public
and
water
users
by
the
method
of
which
you
speak
and
i'm
translating
that
into
legal
terms.
i
would
think
that
it
finally
was
not
intended
to
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
a
suit
to
manage
the
way
the
project
is
carried
on
as
it's
happening
here
or
as
to
prevent
it
from
being
built
as
to
what
have
happened
if
we
have
brought
this
--
the
action
had
been
brought
a
little
earlier.
third,
i
would
point
out
that
both
the
fifth
and
in
a
case
prior
to
this
one,
the
ninth
circuit
have
interpreted
the
statute
in
a
way
that
we
contend
that
it
should
be
interpreted
and
the
ninth
circuit
particularly
of
course
is
one
familiar
with
water
law
and
with
this
kind
of
problem.
the
case
to
which
i
refer
in
the
ninth
circuit
unfortunately
is
not
in
our
brief.
the
reference
is
nevada
against
the
united
states,
nevada
against
the
united
states,
279
f.2d
699,
279
f.2d
699
fifth
circuit
case,
is
in
our
brief.
now
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
respects
in
which
this
case
fails
to
be
a
suit
for
the
general
adjudication
of
water
rights.
there
are
a
number
of
them.
without
taking
time,
i'll
simply
going
to
refer
to
one
and
that
is
that
it
is
perfectly
claimed
that
this
decree
does
not
adjudicate
any
rights
as
between
the
various
water
owners
--
well,
various
water
rights
owners
on
the
stream.
it
simply
adjudicates
what
are
alleged
to
be
rights
against
the
united
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
said
just
exactly
what
i'm
saying
now.
it
said
that
for
the
reasons
mentioned
in
our
brief
that
this
was
not
a
suit
for
the
general
adjudication
of
water
right.
the
most
important
of
those
reasons
is
that
judge
hall
in
the
district
court
himself
said
and
i
quote
from
his
opinion,
“this
is
not
a
suit
wherein
plaintiff
seeks
to
establish
for
each
of
them
their
separate
rights
[inaudible]
to
a
given
quantity
of
water
as
between
themselves
or
as
against
one
another.
and
again,
this
is
not
--
this
suit
is
not
a
case
where
water
users
either
riparian
or
overlying
are
seeking
to
enforce
any
separate
or
several
rights.
in
the
findings
and
conclusions,
the
judge
said,
it
is
not
the
intention
of
the
court
to
attempt
to
divide
the
waters
of
the
san
joaquin
river
between
the
plaintiffs.
this
was
plainly
a
suit
against
us.
it
wasn't
for
a
general
declaration
of
right.
now,
there
is
only
one
other
thing
i
need
to
add
on
this
point.
even
if
there
could
be
doubt
as
to
whether
this
statute
gives
consent
to
the
kind
of
suit
seeking
a
physical
solution
which
i
don't
think
there's
anybody,
even
if
it
could,
it
certainly
doesn't
give
consent
to
a
suit
seeking
a
declaration
of
the
price
that
the
secretary
shall
charge
for
a
project
water
and
it
certainly
doesn't
constitute
consent
to
a
declaratory
judgment
as
between
the
united
states
and
fresno
just
the
two
of
them
as
to
future
rights
through
appropriation
in
the
natural
flow
of
the
stream.
so
that
we
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
quite
plainly
correct
on
this
point
in
ruling
in
favor
of
the
united
states
that
it
had
given
no
consent
to
be
sued.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
there
is
some
possibility
that
such
an
action
as
that
would
lie.
there
are
decisions
which
would
seem
to
sustain
--
swigart
and
baker
was
a
case
of
that
kind
justice
black,
the
one
referred
to
by
mr.
rowe.
there
it
was
claimed
that
the
secretary
had
wrongly
included
the
cost
of
maintenance
in
calculating
the
rates
that
were
to
be
charged
for
irrigation
of
water
because
the
maintenance
budget
and
he
threatened
to
cut
off
the
water
as
i
recall
it
unless
the
owners
pay
them.
the
suit
was
allowed
to
proceed
to
enjoin
the
cutting
off
of
the
water
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
wrongful
interference
with
the
irrigators'
rights
because
of
the
unauthorized
act
of
the
secretary
to
which
that
he
had
not
computed
according
to
the
statutory
formula.
but
note
that
it
was
--
he
had
done
something,
he
was
alleged
to
be
doing
something
outside
of
his
authority
whereas
here
--
and
the
suit
wasn't
against
the
united
states,
whereas
here,
the
judgment
is
sought
against
the
united
states.
it
is
sought
in
advance
to
bind
the
secretary
as
to
what
he
shall
do
and
it
doesn't
run
against
anybody
threatening
to
cut
off
fresno's
water
from
the
project
because
fresno
hasn't
built
the
system
and
equipment,
it
can't
take
any
water
from
the
project.
so
that
what
i'm
saying
is
that
if
sometime
in
the
future
when
fresno
were
taking
water,
the
secretary
should
determine
a
rate
which
it
was
alleged
that
he
had
no
authority
under
the
statute
to
determine
then
i
would
think
that
there
was
at
least
an
argument.
certainly,
they
would
be
under
swigart
and
baker
that
the
action
could
be
maintained.
now
the
reason
i
put
it,
it
may
quite
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no.
i
think
this
is
applicable
only
to
fresno.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
that
if
it
were
held
that
the
united
states
had
consented
under
the
statute
then
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
issues
which
we
still
would
be
free
to
argue
and
i
presume
in
the
ninth
circuit.
for
example,
we
don't
admit
for
a
minute,
we
think
we're
plainly
right
with
respect
to
the
rate
for
reasons
that
are
spelled
out
in
our
brief.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
are
but
we
don't
admit.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
we
--
i
believe
that
the
point
was
reserved
in
the
ninth
circuit.
this
is
no--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
wiser
to
have
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals.
for
one
thing,
i'm
afraid
that
we
haven't
given
the
court
all
the
materials
necessary
to
decide
it
up
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
talking
about
51
now.
mr.
archibald
cox
51?
no,
no.
because
the
court
of
appeals
hasn't
decided
the
merits
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
it
has
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
dismissed
the
united
states
--
it
has
decided
nothing,
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
archibald
cox
on
the
merits
of
fresno's
special
claims
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
as
a
city.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
we
would
have
some
arguments
in
that
point.
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
the
county
of
origin
and
watershed
of
origin
our
problem.
if
i
were
representing
the
plaintiffs,
the
argument
that
i
might
try
to
make
is
that
the
county
of
origin
and
watershed
of
origin
statutes
of
california
bind
the
united
states
that
the
united
states
and
its
officials
were
given
no
authority
to
make
any
takings
in
violation
of
those
statutes
and
that
therefore
they
did
act
outside
the
scope
of
their
authority.
now,
there
are
--
i'll
give
answers
after
lunch.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
think
there
are
three
answers
to
the
argument
that
the
petitioners
in
51
and
respondents
in
31,
the
plaintiffs
might
make
with
respect
to
the
county
of
origin
and
watershed
statutes.
the
third
of
the
three
that
i
want
to
develop,
i
simply
mentioned
the
other
two.
the
first
is
that
we
think
that
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act
when
it
requires
the
bureau
to
conform
to
state
law
is
talking
about
the
rights
that
the
bureau
must
respect
in
making
a
taking.
that
is
to
say,
you
may
not
wipe
out
state
right
if
the
right
exists
by
state
law,
you
must
take
it
but
you
can't
override
it,
and
that
it
does
not
limit
the
power
of
the
bureau
and
the
administration
of
the
project
which
would
include
the
taking
of
rights
under
state
law.
this
we
think
is
settled
by
the
ivanhoe
case
where
the
court
drew
a
distinction
between
the
administration
of
project
and
the
recognition
of
state
rights
in
acquiring
land
and
water
rights
of
the
project.
second,
we
think
that
in
any
event,
the
california
watershed
in
county
of
origin
laws
have
no
application
to
the
friant
dam,
madera
canal
and
friant-kern
canal
to
that
part
of
this
project.
we
think
that's
the
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
california
did
not
purport
to
make
its
watershed
law
applicable
to
the
united
states
until
1951.
and
at
that
time,
this
project
was
substantially
completed.
now,
we
think
it
exceedingly
unlikely
that
either
california
or
the
congress
in
enacting
the
reclamation
act
intended
to
give
the
state
power
ex
post
facto
to
control
the
building
and
taking
of
rights
for
federal
projects.
now,
the
reference
--
now,
i
invite
justice
goldberg's
attention
to
this
particularly.
the
references
in
mr.
rowe's
brief
to
congressional
declarations
referring
to
the
state
county
of
origin
and
watershed
laws
are
very
misleading.
if
you
read
the
entire
statute,
these
come
from
the
acts
making
preliminary
appropriations
for
studies,
the
one
on
page
16
in
his
brief
is
for
the
american
river
unit
of
the
central
valley
project.
now,
for
our
template
in
that,
well,
it's
up
here
some
place,
way
north
in
any
event
of
the
south
--
the
branch
of
the
san
joaquin
we're
talking
about.
and
it
speaks
of
a
--
shall
make
recommendations,
this
is
in
making
the
feasibility
report,
which
precedes
construction,
shall
make
recommendations
which
with
respect
to
that
aspect
of
it
deal
--
had
conformed
to
the
state
law.
our
third
point,
and
the
one
which
i
really
think
is
dispositive
and
that
i
want
to
take
the
rest
of
my
time
dealing
with,
is
that
we
think
it
is
very
plain
that
there
has
been
no
violation
of
the
state
laws.
once
that
meaning
is
correctly
understood,
that
assuming
we're
required
to
conform
to
them,
we
have
conformed
to
them
a
100%.
this
requires
treating
them
separately
and
you
will
find
a
great
deal
of
useful
information
about
the
state
laws
even
if
you
don't
feel
bound
by
the
interpretation,
and
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
of
california
which
is
in
25
opinions
of
the
attorney
general
of
california
beginning
at
page
8,
that's
a
general
discussion,
25
opinions

it's
not
referred
–
and
that's
it's
in
a
footnote,
it's
not
in
our
brief,
and
it
has
a
great
deal
of
useful
background.
now,
it's
necessary
to
talk
about
these
statutes
separately
and
i
speak
first
to
the
county
of
origin.
it
has
no
application
here
at
all
for
these
reasons.
california
back
in
the
20s,
when
water
began
to
be
getting
short,
hit
upon
a
scheme
whereby
the
state
would
acquire
all
the
water
rights
theretofore
unappropriated
because
there
had
been
people
who
had
made
appropriations.
there
had
been
riparian
rights,
but
california
made
a
filing
for
everything
over
and
above
that.
then
the
--
a
state
official
was
authorized
under
certain
circumstances
to
release
filings
or
to
assign
the
state's
filing
to
other
people.
and
the
county
of
origin
statute
says,
“no
priority
under
this
part
shall
be
released,
nor
assignment
made
of
any
appropriation
that
will
in
the
judgment
of
the
department
of
finance
deprive
the
county
which
appropriated
water,
i
must
have
made
a
mistake
but
deprive
the
county
of
any
such
water
necessary
to
the
development
of
the
county.
but
if
we
speak,
it
was
a
limitation
on
his
power
to
make
assignments
and
it
was
a
limitation
that
he
shouldn't
make
assignments
when
in
his
judgment
the
water
was
necessary
in
the
county.
now,
in
this
case,
the
united
states
did
get
an
assignment
and
even
if
it
hadn't,
there
would
under
this
statute,
be
no
right
that
could
be
asserted
here
under
the
county
of
origin
statute
because
the
only
thing
they
would
have
the
right
to
do
would
be
to
go
to
the
department
of
finance
and
try
and
get
an
assignment
themselves.
they
haven't
been
able
to
have
done
that
so
that
we
think
that
statute
is
entirely
inapplicable.
now,
with
respect
to
the
watershed
statute,
it
seems
to
us
that
they
add
absolutely
nothing
to
the
case
of
the
riparian
and
overlying
owners
for
this
reason.
the
watershed
statutes
which
are
as
conveniently
set
forth
as
anagram
at
pages
381
and
382
of
the
light-colored
volume
of
the
record,
that's
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's,
no
at
volume
7,
that's
the
light-colored
one.
mr.
archibald
cox
pages
381
and
382.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
perhaps,
mr.
veeder
can
give
it
to
me.
i've
got
a
little
time
left
for
that.
these
statutes,
you
will
note
taking
water
code
11460
at
the
bottom
of
381,
in
the
construction
and
operation
by
the
department
of
any
project
under
the
provisions
of
this
part,
a
watershed
area
where
water
--
wherein
water
originates,
an
area
immediately
adjacent
thereto
which
conveniently
be
supplied
from
water
there
from
shall
not
be
deprived
by
the
department
directly
or
indirectly
of
the
prior
right
to
all
water
reasonably
acquired
to
adequately
supply
the
beneficial
needs
of
watershed.
this
applies
to
the
way
the
state
water
department
shall
operate
its
projects.
now,
assuming
that
it
is
applicable
to
the
way
the
united
states
uprights
its
projects,
which
seems
doubtful,
it's
still
quite
clear
that
it
applies
only
to
people
who
are
hoping
to
acquire
rights
in
the
stream
by
appropriation
in
the
future
and
they
have
the
right
to
go
and
make
a
filing
intending
to
show
that
they
can
use
water.
this
is
made
very
clear
in
the
california
attorney
general's
opinion.
no
inhabitant
of
the
watershed
of
origin
becomes
possessed
of
any
presently
vested
title
or
right
to
any
specific
quantity
of
water
as
the
result
of
this
statute.
as
the
need
of
such
an
indivi
--
inhabitant
develops,
he
must
comply
with
the
general
water
law
of
the
state,
that
is
he
goes
and
tries
to
make
a
filing
in
the
court.
i'm
reading
from
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
of
california,
the
one
that
i've
referred
the
court
to
a
moment
ago.
he
goes
and
tries
to
make
filing,
he
must
comply
with
the
general
water
law
of
the
state
both
substantively
and
procedurally
to
apply
for
and
perfect
a
water
right.
now
none
of
the
overlying
and
riparian
owners
that
--
may
i
take
the
liberty
of
going
out
a
few
minutes,
mr.
justice
black,
none
of
these
riparian
or
overlying
owners
have
gone
to
make
the
filing
and
they
have
no
need
to
make
the
filing,
because
they
as
riparian
owners
do
have
a
vested
right
and
the
statute
deals
with
people
who
hope
to
get
rights
in
the
future
with
the
protection
of
people
who
don't
have
any
water
right
at
the
present
time,
but
who
may
later
want
it
and
the
statute
has
an
effort
to
protect
them
as
in
that
time.
now,
what
protection
does
it
give
them?
part
of
the
answer
to
that
is
in
water
code
11461,
the
first
full
section
quoted
on
page
382.
in
no
other
way
than
by
purchase
or
otherwise
as
provided
in
this
part
shall
water
rights
or
watershed
area
or
the
inhabitants
be
impaired
or
curtailed
by
the
department.
but
the
part
gives
the
department
power
to
take
by
eminent
domain.
now,
in
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
and
in
the
portion
that
it's
quoted
by
mr.
rowe,
the
attorney
general
said,
“well,
you
can't
condemn
these
water
rights,
any
rights
under
the
watershed
statute
until
the
inhabitant
has
gone
and
made
a
filing
because
these
are
future
things
and
you
can't
take
them
away
until
they
inchoate
something,
has
been
vested
but
he
goes
on
and
says
in
the
opinion,
once
it
is
vested
then
it
can
be
condemned.
well
now,
these
people,
assuming
the
statute
applies
to
them
at
all
which
is
dubious
because
it's
intended
to
these
people
over
those
who
have
vested
rights,
at
the
very
least
they
have
their
rights
are
vested,
the
riparian
and
overlying
owners,
and
therefore
assuming
the
statute
applies
to
us,
we
were
in
a
position
to
condemn
them
either
by
eminent
domain
proceeding
or
by
appropriation
of
taking,
and
that
to
the
extent
that
we
interfered
at
all
is
what
we
say
we've
done.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
except
that
i
suppose
it
takes
me
back
by
two
different
routes.
the
first
route
is
by
the
route
of
the
ivanhoe
case.
there's
the
reclamation
where
it
doesn't
require
to
do
any
more
than
pay
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
now
this
one
says
that
by
state
law
we're
entitled
to
take.
i
don't
mean
directly
but
the
state
law
recognizes
the
power
once
these
rights
become
vested
to
take
them
by
eminent
domain
so
that
we
don't
have
a
case,
justice
stewart
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
second
argument
--
well
--
no,
the
first
argument
takes
care
of
the
case
where
the
state
law
might
say
you
can't
condemn
rights
under
the
county
of
origin
statute,
then
i
would
have
to
rely
either
on
my
ivanhoe
argument
or
my
argument
that
this
can't
--
doesn't
apply
to
this
aspect
of
the
project
because
it
would
be
retroactive
that
kind
have
been
intended.
my
ultimate
rule
says
that
under
state
law
as
soon
as
these
become
vested,
they
can
be
condemned
and
that
either
they
are
vested
so
they
could
complete
the
dam
here
or
the
will
of
the
risk,
there's
been
no
violation.
i
guess
it
doesn't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
we
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
you
can
interfere
with
the
flow
of
water.
this
is
what
we're
alleged
to
of
--
which
what's
been
alleged
to
have
been
done
here.
indeed,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
those
difficulties,
justice
douglas
are
a
very
good
illustration
of
the
essential
flaw
in
the
argument
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
we
didn't
take
the
steps
necessary
to
exercise
our
authority
to
condemn
these
rights.
because
what
--
there's
a
point
about
how
shutting
off
the
dam
of
most
watersheds
affected
this
underground
water.
we
say
that
it
didn't
affect
it
at
all.
they
say
it
has
a
tremendous
effect
on
it.
experts
don't
write
on
both
sides.
now,
if
we
were
required
in
advance
to
describe
exactly
what
we
were
taking
from
the
defendants
so
many
gallons
of
water,
so
many
acre-feet
of
water,
we
would
be
in
a
terrible
position.
if
they
were
right
and
we
understate
it
because
our
experts
understated
the
amount
of
damage,
then
under
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
whole
project
can
be
enjoined
and
the
physical
solutions
provided.
on
the
other
hand,
if
we
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
but
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
suppose
we
haven't,
suppose
we
had
filed
but
we
undoubtedly
would
have
been
if
we
had
chosen
to
proceed
by
condemnation
whereas
to
condemn
the
riparian
rights.
we
deny
that
we've
affected
these
overlying
rights
so
that
if
--
now,
that's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
and
that's
what
i'm
--
that's
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make.
should
the
whole
progress
of
the
federal
project
be
dependent
upon
whether
a
district
court
finds
that
we
made
a
mistake
in
believing
our
experts
rather
than
believing
the
other
side
of
experts?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that
seems
to
me
that
i
am
trying
to
argue
that
that
is
what
the
position
that
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
puts
us
in
and
i
think
it
does.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
why
--
what
was
wrong
with
it?
they
didn't
say
we
had
to
file
in
condemnation.
they
said
that
we
didn't
succeed
in
taking
because
we
didn't
state
sufficiently
exactly
what
we
were
taking.
now,
i
take
it
that
that
means
if
we
didn't
strongly
been
here
exactly
where
the
lines
led.
there's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
i
thought
it
is.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
and
we
have
to
take
it
all
apparently
as
they
would
define
all
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
rather
than
as
we
would
define
them.
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
what
is
all
is
something
that's
uncertain.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
by
of
course,
basically
our
point
is
that
that
argument
should
be
resolved
in
the
tucker
act
and
not
by
tying
up
the
whole
project,
that
otherwise,
and
i
think
this
does
follow
justice
douglas
that
otherwise,
wherever
we
made
a
mistake,
wherever
our
experts
didn't
guess
what
the
district
court
would
call,
we
were
subject
to
an
injunction
tying
up
an
entire
reclamation
project
until
we
went
and
made
new
filings
while
they're
putting
us
to
make
new
filings
for
taking
as
a
simpler
way
as
to
have
the
whole
thing
settled
in
a
tucker
act
suit.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
state
water
board
in
a
proceeding
after
the
completion
of
the
case
of
the
district
court
did
find
that
there
was
no
water
left
over
and
above
the
assignment
that
california
made
to
us,
that's
right.
so
that
there
is
a
point
i
hadn't
well
done
because
it
came
after
the
closing
of
the
record,
but
so
far
as
fresno
was
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
she
had
rights
in
the
natural
flow
over
and
above
us,
the
state
water
board
has
decided
it
the
other
way.
i'm
afraid
i've
extended
the
liberty
that
you
gave
me
too
far.
