justice
potter
stewart
is
fresno
a
plaintiff
in
that
suit?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
number
51
here?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
it
wasn't
--
if
it
was
a
tort,
would
the
court
of
claims
have
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
because
it's
not
--
it's
clearly
not
within
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
not
within
the
tucker
act,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
whether
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
no
remedy
--
justice
potter
stewart
not
on
these
laws.
justice
potter
stewart
i
missed
that.
i'm
sorry.
justice
potter
stewart
i
missed
what
you
just
said,
could
you
repeat
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
he
the
termite
expert?
justice
potter
stewart
you
did
bring
it
out
in
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
somebody
there
in
the
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
gerlach
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--where
was
the
property
of
the
plaintiff's
located?
was
it
located
along
the
same
stretch
between
friant
dam
and
gravelly
ford?
justice
potter
stewart
where
does
that
fit
onto
that
map
there
roughly?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
san
joaquin
as
it
goes
northward.
justice
potter
stewart
san
joaquin.
then
any
of
it
--
my
basic
question
was
that
case
didn't
involve
the
portion
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
between
friant
and
gravelly
ford.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
is
that
this
authorization
which
mr.
justice
goldberg
illustrated
is
limited.
he
may
take
all
property
necessary
for
said
purposes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
said
purposes
do
not
include
the
statutory
power
to
take
water
out
of
that
section
of
the
san
joaquin
river
between
friant
dam
and
gravelly
ford
for
the
purpose
of
building
those
canals
north
and
south
of
friant
dam,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
reclamation
act
directs
him
to
follow
state
law
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
because
you
have
the
county
and
watershed
of
origin.
justice
potter
stewart
the
secretary
testifying
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
before
congress.
justice
potter
stewart
before
the
national
committee.
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
from
the
san
joaquin
river
or
is
it
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
of
now,
fresno
gets
its
water
supply
from
wells,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
and
the
claim
is
the
level
of
these
wells
is
going
down
because
--
justice
potter
stewart
from
the
project.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
we're
talking
about
51
now.
justice
potter
stewart
that
takes
you
back
to
argument
number
one
in
your
answer,
wasn't
it?
that
that
--
that
all
you
had
to
do
was
respect
property
rights
in
water
under
state
law
if
that's
all
the
reclamation
act
requires.
justice
potter
stewart
than
pay.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
what
you
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
that
you
had
to
take
it
all,
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
about
the
point
if
you're
going
to
do
it
this
way.
now,
the
partial
taking
was
simply
a
trespass.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
subject
to
an
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
compensation
in
terms
of
water.
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
if
the
court
will
say,
we'll
enjoin
its
appropriation
unless
you
provide
for
this.
