justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
wright,
what
are
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
suppose
we
would've
vacated
this
judgment
of
conviction
and
remand
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
that's
where
it
would
go,
would
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
dispatch
now
represented
to
us
by
the
attorney
general,
i
take
it
is
that
--
of
texas?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
i
--
do
i
correctly
infer
from
your
answers
mr.
wright,
that
you're
not
sure
what
would
happen
if
you
were
to
send
--
vacate
this
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wright,
the
tenor
of
this
is
not
alone
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
trial,
but
indeed
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
alleged
offense,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
do
you
know,
of
any
actual
[inaudible]?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
don't
understand
this
type
of
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
whether
you
know
--
whether
you
act
to
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
fact
is
mr.
allen
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
maybe
an
unfair
question,
if
it
is
[inaudible]?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
--
that
the
vacation
is
[inaudible]?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he's
been
acquitted
[inaudible].
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
–
like
that
[inaudible].
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
expand
this,
the
mandate
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see
mr.
wright,
the
--
you
said,
insane
at
the
time
of
the
act,
but
sane
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
i'm
sorry.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
insane
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
what's
the
verdict
if
also
insane
at
the
time
of
the
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
any
way
to
–
committing
a
man
a
[inaudible]?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
might
very
well,
as
i
suggested
a
little
earlier,
that
may
probably
--
probably
he
is,
isn't
it
on
this
--
and
i'll
say
it
to
myself
again.
i
won't
[inaudible].
it
does
seem
to
me
on
what
we
now
have
before
us
that‘s
where
he's
going
to
be
the
rest
of
his
life?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
questions
that
my
brother
stewart
suggested
namely,
as
i
understand
it,
certainly
he's
a
[inaudible]
qualified
psychiatrist.
i
gather
even
the
total
number
of
it
is
something
under
7000
or
8000
and
only
a
couple
of
thousands
of
them
that
would
get
involved
in
forensic
psychiatrics
at
all.
now,
what
would
you
suppose
in
constitutional
terms
would
be
the
case
if
texas
had
a
panel
of
state
paid
psychiatrists
and
you
were
allowed
to
make
an
application
for
the
examination
of
your
client
by
one
of
that
group
and
that
was
the
extent
of
which
that
texas
made
provision
for,
a
psychiatric
assistance
for
indigents.
would
that
satisfy
your
due
process
claim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
i
don't
understand,
you're
accounted
for,
is
that
[inaudible]
in
order
to
have
a
[inaudible]?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
incidentally
mr.
wright,
i
understand
that
whatever
they
are
called,
the
psychiatrists,
the
general
terms,
the
terms
of
expert
witnesses
on
this
question
of
insanity,
there's
considerable
disagreement,
i
should
say,
within
their
own
profession
whether
they‘re
actually
qualified
on
the
question
of
guilt
of
innocent
--
or
innocence
as
contrasted
with
their
qualifications
to
treat
one
who
found
guilty
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
nevertheless,
has
to
be
treated.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
they
chafe
just
as
much
under
their
rule
as
i
understand
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
to
guilt
or
innocence?
