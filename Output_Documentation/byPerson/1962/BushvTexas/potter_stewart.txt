justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wright,
i
know
you're
here
trying
to
prevail
on
what
seemed
to
you
important
constitutional
questions,
but
i
trust
that
before
your
argument
is
finished,
you’ll
tell
us
what
do
you
think
is
the
effect
of
the
supplemental
brief
which
had
been
filed
for
the
respondent
yesterday
i
think,
showing
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
thinking,
mr.
wright,
not
so
much
of
mootness
as
i
was
of
a
--
the
equivalent
of
a
confession
of
error.
this
--
a
psychiatrist
this
time
employed
by
the
state.
the
state
--
state's
psychiatrist
have
now
told
us
that
the
petitioner
here
was
only
partly
or
not
at
all
responsible
for
his
acts
for
many
years
and
--
when
did
this
alleged
crime
occurred?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that's
certainly
within
many
years,
however
many
years
it
is
and
--
isn't
this
then
a
finding
by
the
state's
expert
that
the
--
that
the
--
this
person
was
probably
not
guilty?
justice
potter
stewart
but
we
do
have
it
now
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
--
as
i
understand
your
briefs,
your
earlier
briefs,
the
texas
law
is
clear
and
i
suppose
the
law
of
every
state
is
clear
that
the
person
cannot
be
convicted
of
the
criminal
offense
if
indeed
he
was
not
responsible
for
his
acts
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
how
far
do
you
think
those
implications
go?
i
suppose
a
man
who
is
rich
enough
and
i
--
there
are
a
good
many
rich
men
in
texas,
he
could
get
the
very
best
psychiatrist.
he
wouldn't
be
confined
to
texas.
he
might
--
they
might
--
the
best
one
in
the
united
states
might
by
common
consent
be
in
new
york
or
san
francisco.
he
could
get
him.
in
other
words,
the
--
those
implications
don't
--
you
can't
read
the
literal
language
of
that
sentence
which
you
quoted
from
griffin
against
illinois
to
the
--
for
the
extreme
implications
of
the
state's
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
rules
still
does
--
i
mean,
the
facts
whatever
the
rule
may
be
and
whatever
the
ideal
may
be,
the
facts
of
life
are
that
for
better
or
for
worst,
the
kind
of
a
trial
a
man
gets
does
to
an
extent
depend
on
how
much
money
he
has
and
how
good
his
judgment
is
in
selecting
lawyers
and
doctors,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
the
rules
in
the
world
aren't
going
to
change
those
facts
of
life.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
matter
of
degree
then
because
here
you
did
have
a
physician
who
had
studied
psychiatry
in
medical
school.
and
who,
in
his
private
practice,
had
treated
people
with
minor
emotional
problems.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
merits,
that
jury
also
--
your
defense
was
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
jury
heard
substantially
the
same
evidence
except
not
--
but
not
doctor
dial
and
the
police
chief
instead
of
the
jailer
or
something
like
that,
the
sheriff
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
virtually
the
same
--
justice
potter
stewart
plus
however,
plus
the
finding
of
the
previous
day's
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
about
--
he
had
about
six
years
experience
in
general
practice,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
medical
school
and
then
he
had
about
six
years
practice.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
doesn't
the
record
also
show
that
in
order
to
become
a
psychiatrist
and
i
know
your
point
that
in
texas
there
is
no
such
a
thing.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
order
to
become
a
fellow
or
whatever
it
is,
it
takes
five
or
six
years
of
post
graduate
study
after
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
four
to
six
years?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you're
allowed
to
practice
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
dr.
dial
was
donating
his
services
except
for
his
gasoline.
how
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
far
do
you
have
to
come
from
where
he
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
30
miles.
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
on
the
faculty
of
the
southern
methodist.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
other
hand,
there's
i
supposed
there's
nothing
in
our
rules
that
prevent
us
from
doing
this
or
to
prevent
us
from
vacating
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
remanding
it
to
the
trial
court
for
consideration
in
the
light
of
this
subsequent
development.
i
don't
see
why
we're
so
bothered
with
the
texas
procedure,
the
case
is
here
now.
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
ask
you
this,
mr.
allen.
justice
potter
stewart
you
agree
with
brother
goldberg,
this
is
--
very
commendable
of
you
to
have
brought
this
to
our
attention,
this
later
psychiatric
report
and
yet
having
done
so
now
you
tell
us
it's
meaningless.
it
has
no
effect
at
all.
what
was
the
purpose
of
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
but
under
your
law,
as
soon
as
--
if
you,
[inaudible]
he
is
certified
as
being
recovered.
he
goes
back
to
the
penitentiary.
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
penitentiary,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
which
--
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
--
was
it
--
didn't
it
appear
there
was
--
run
after
--
that
the
doctor,
what
is
the
name,
carter?
justice
potter
stewart
compton?
justice
potter
stewart
compton
knew
about
this
strange
behavior
of
this
man
of
bringing
home
a
--
he
was
working
for
and
living
with
a
couple
there
and
he
would
bring
home
a
couple
of
saddles,
and
gates,
and
free
trashcans,
and
would
just
leave
them
in
the
pickup
truck
and
not
attempt
to
hide
them
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
well,
bring
home
some
scaffolds
and
just
bring
home
with
the
odd
hours
in
the
night
and
they
say
not
attempt
to
him
them
or
anything.
that
on
its
face
even
to
a
layman
doesn't
seem
like
very
rational
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
and
apparently
he
never
tried
to
sell
or
get
any
benefit
about
how
these
stuff
that
he
bring
home.
justice
potter
stewart
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
did
he
try
to
whereas
in
helping
people
he
said,
that
was
his
motive?
justice
potter
stewart
that
his
motive
was
he
like
to
helped
people.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
allen,
i
have
one
other
mechanical
question.
i
had
seemed
to
have
here
a
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
brief
amicus
curiae,
but
no
brief.
has
an
amicus
brief
been
filed?
do
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
so
no
brief
has
been
filed?
justice
potter
stewart
if
he
should
be
pardoned
now
i
suppose
it
could
be
assumed
that
civil
commitment
proceedings
would
be
initiated
against
him?
justice
potter
stewart
would
he
end
up
in
the
same
hospital
or
a
different
hospital?
justice
potter
stewart
i
wondered
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
want
--
in
some
states
they
have
certain
hospitals
there
for
the
so-called
criminally
insane
and
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
--
in
the
same
hospital?
justice
potter
stewart
and
treated
the
same
way,
the
same
--
justice
potter
stewart
custodial
treatment
depending
upon
their
condition
rather
it
upon
their
previous
criminal
record
or
the
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
point
is
that
there's
no
record,
there's
no
--
in
the
record,
there's
no
request
for
any
more
time.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
event,
that's
a
different
request,
isn't
it?
it's
not
a
request
for
more
time
for
dr.
--
justice
potter
stewart
what's
his
name
--
appointed
to
examine
him?
justice
potter
stewart
the
only
time
as
an
automatic
commitment
as
i
understand
it
is
upon
a
finding
that
he
was
sane
at
the
time
of
the
crime
but
insane
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
i
say
at
the
very
outset
that
i
know
that
your
interest
is
presenting
and
trying
to
get
decided
in
your
favor
and
what's
used
in
important
constitutional
question
i
understand
that
but
after
all
as
you
recognize,
we're
faced
with
deciding
an
individual
case.
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
there
are
some
states
in
the
union
where
there
are
hardly
any
psychiatrists.
north
dakota,
i
wonder
how
many
psychiatrists
are
there.
justice
potter
stewart
where
are
they
appointed?
justice
potter
stewart
to
public
institutions?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
the
word
expert
is
ambiguous
--
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
in
that
state,
they
consider
any
physician
an
expert.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
in
this
case,
the
part
of
your
argument
has
been
[inaudible]
as
these
arguments
traditionally
are
that
the
defendant
should
--
that
there
should
not
be
an
unequal
struggle,
that
the
defendant
should
have
something
close
to
the
equivalent
resources
that
the
state
in
all
its
majesty
has.
and
if
that
argument
isn't
of
much
relevance
in
this
case,
is
it
because
the
state
didn't
have
any
psychiatrist.
they
didn't
have
any
such
things.
justice
potter
stewart
the
state
had
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
this
1924
commitment.
the
state
had
the
burden
of
proof
and
there
was
the
presumption
that
this
man
was
insane.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
jury
was
so
instructed,
and
the
state
had
the
burden
of
proof
that
he
was
not
insane
and
the
state
couldn't
have
just
a
layman
plus
this
doctor
who
you
say
was
not
qualified
as
an
expert.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
like
your
handwriting
case
where
you
have
a
layman
saying,
“well,
that
looks
like
his
handwriting.
well,
in
cross
examination
you
can
show
that
this
fellow
has
no
--
is
not
qualified
to
say
--
to
testify
because
he
is
--
your
case
is
a
little
different,
isn't
it,
from
the
ordinary
case
that
we
read
about
and
that
they're
so
much
mooted
these
days
where
the
state
is
armed
with
all
these
resources
and
the
defendant
is
denied
them.
here,
the
state
didn't
have
any
such
help
and
the
state
has
a
burden
of
proof
that
this
man
was
not
insane.
justice
potter
stewart
then
you
--
but
there's
no
way
of
knowing
had
the
state
had
one
that
you
would
have
been
denied
one
either.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly
what
mr.
justice
harlan
is
suggesting
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
he's
--
what
it
--
the
system
he
is
suggesting
is
the
system
that
prevailed
at
common
law
until
a
few
decades
ago
30,
40,
50
years
ago,
this
was
all
a
testimony
you
ever
had
in
a
case
with
--
which
is
the
lay
testimony
generally,
a
testimony
as
to
the
actions
and
the
conduct
and
the
record
of
the
defendant,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
where
was
this?
justice
potter
stewart
in
england?
justice
potter
stewart
in
every
state?
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
obviously
not
because
they‘re
still
not
in
every
state
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
[inaudible].
