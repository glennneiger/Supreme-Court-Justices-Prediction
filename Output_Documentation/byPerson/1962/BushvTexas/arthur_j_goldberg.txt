mr.

--
justice

before
you
go
into
the
[inaudible]
justice
arthur

[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.

arthur

and
the
same
procedure
however,
i
take
it
that
while
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.

[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
allen,
would
you
say
just
his
word
about
the
question
of
whether
the
court
afforded
dr.
dial
an
opportunity
to
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
may
i
ask
you
therefore,
would
you
think
it's
permissible
to
answer
from
your
[inaudible].
why
is
that
not
done
in
this
case
and
what
do
--
as
to
very
specific
question?
here
is
new
evidence
by
the
state
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
which
bears
upon
the
question
of
his
innocence
or
guilt
--
to
this
man
because
he
was
insane,
they
all
agree.
he
did
not
know
right
from
wrong,
he
wasn't
responsible.
he
should
not
have
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
and
this
evidence
has
come
to
the
attention
of
the
state
as
the
state
now
files
a
[inaudible]
and
the
state's
evidence
[inaudible]
people,
this
evidence
would
certainly
--
would've
been
pertinent
on
the
question
of
his
innocence
or
guilt,
namely,
his
responsibility
at
the
time
he's
committed
the
crime.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
situation
they
confront
this
with?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
would
you
then
state
to
me
in
light
of
that
what
is
the
state's
position
now.
what
should
this
court
do
under
those
circumstances?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
that
--
would
you
then
deal
with
this
--
this
is
new
evidence.
here
is
the
doctor
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
a
psychiatrist
saying
the
assumption
of
the
above
diagnosis,
we
would
have
to
assume
that
james
is
only
partly
or
not
at
all
responsible
for
his
acts
for
very
many
years.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so,
here
is
an
expert,
state
witness,
who
examined
this
man
after
the
trial,
has
said,
testified.
in
fact,
the
state
can
file
with
us
except
that
of
the
affidavit.
he
says
that
his
man
was
lacking
in
responsibility.
it
is
fair
that
[inaudible]
for
very
many
years
at
the
time
they
find
this
in
evidence.
isn't
that
the
exemplary
question
of
newly
discovered
evidence,
is
that
a
[inaudible],
going
to
the
fashion
of
his
guilt
during
the
pendency
of
an
appeal?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
this
is
the
defense.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
this
is
a
state
representation
throughout
that
according
to
a
state
[inaudible],
this
man
was
not
responsible
at
the
time
the
crime
was
