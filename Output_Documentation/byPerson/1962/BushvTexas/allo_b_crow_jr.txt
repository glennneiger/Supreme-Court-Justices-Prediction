mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
stewart,
that
brief
was
a
request
by
the
american
civil
liberties
union
to
file
amicus
curiae
in
behalf
of
the
petitioner
and
the
request
was
granted,
but
then
they
did
not
file.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
yes.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
this
was
tried
in
october.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
tried
in
april
the
21st.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
that
either
i
misunderstood
a
question
or
perhaps
i
didn't.
i
----
but
i
feel
--
did
you
ask
mr.
allen
if
mr.
bush,
the
state
hospital
does
not
get
any
better
will
he
be
removed
to
the
state
penitentiary?
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
no,
sir.
if
he
does
not
regain
his
sanity,
he
will
remain
at
the
state
hospital
and
until
he
is
--
until
the
day
he
dies.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
no
sir,
i
did
not
i
believe
that
isn't
right.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
that
he
will
remain
at
the
state
hospital
so
long
as
his
treatment
is
beneficial,
your
honor.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
well,
i'd
--
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
medical
scientist
is
going
to
release
an
insane
man
as
long
as
there
is
any
hope
of
treating
him
and
curing
him.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
yes
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
your
honor
the
--
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
your
honor
that
is
a
not
in
texas.
the
procedure
is
from
the
state's
attorney
to
argue
that.
however,
i
do
know
that
such
--
should
such
occasion
arise,
the
state's
attorney
would
call
that
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
and
it
is
within
the
court's
discretion
as
to
what
action
should
be
taken
and
the
state's
attorney
can
move
for
dismiss
it
and
remand
to
the
trial
court.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
--
the
state
position
as
to
this
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
the
trial
court
in
that
there
is
no
showing
by
the
mere
fact
that
this
man
is
now
been
declared
mentally
ill
by
a
state
psychiatrist
since
there
is
no
showing
that
he
was
denied
due
process
in
1961.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
i
think
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
yes,
sir,
it
does.
it
does.
it
--
its
--
goes
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence,
may
it
please
court.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
--
this
--
it
is
the
state's
contention
that
that
--
this
is
not
binding
upon
the
state
--
of
the
petitioner
back
at
the
date
of
trial
in
this
case.
there's
a
similarity
between
this
and
baldie.
in
the
baldie
case
the
psychiatrist
who's
later
adjudged
to
be
insane.
the
psychiatrist
could
examine
smith
at
the
trial
and
then
he
was
later
adjudged
insane
and
this
court
did
not
feel
that
he
had
been
denied
due
process
merely
because
of
the
fact
that
the
psychiatrist
was
later
insane.
there
was
evidence
in
the
baldie
case
that
the
psychiatrist
was
suffering
a
mental
illness
at
the
time
of
the
diagnosis.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
yes
sir
it
is.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
mr.
justice
goldberg,
we
--
the
state
felt
that
this
had
to
be
called
to
the
court's
attention.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
but
we
do
not
feel
that
it
is
entitled
anymore
weight
and
was
accorded
to
this
petitioner
back
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
the
--
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was
not
called
to
our
attention
until
a
week
prior
to
the
trial
of
this
case.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
and
the
brief
had
to
be
printed
and
distributed
and
in
--
and
it
was
--
it
got
here
as
quick
as
it
could.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
well,
it
is
our
contention
that
it
has
no
legal
significance,
your
honor.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
it
is
only
our
contention
that
it
has
no
legal
significance.
i'm
sure
that
the
petitioner
feels
that
it
does
have
a
significance
--
has
significance.
we
--
we
couldn't
sit
on
this
diagnosis.
we
couldn't
suppress
evidence.
we
felt
that
this
had
to
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
we
do
not
feel
that
it
is
indicative
of
the
fact
that
he
was
per
se
insane
at
the
time
of
trial
and
that
he
was
per
se
denied
due
process,
but
we
do
feel
that
it
is
evidence
of
such
that
should
be
considered.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
doctor
hug
testified
--
all
of
the
above
evidence
if
not
otherwise
stated
was
given
by
james
during
a
45-minute
interview.
well
now,
the
psychiatrist,
who
has
made
this
statement
only
examined
him
45
minutes.
petitioner
contends
that
it
takes
a
minimum
of,
i
believe
he
said,
a
3-hour
examination.
dr.
dial
examined
him
20-minutes,
and
said
he
could
not
base
an
opinion
on
that
--
on
that
20-minute
interview.
we
do
not
know
how
long
dr.
compton
examined
him.
it
was
on
two
different
occasions;
once
in
his
office
and
once
in
the
jail
cell.
there
is
--
we
feel
that
this
is
definitely
not
per
se
a
finding
of
insanity
at
the
time
but
it
is
evidence
that
this
court
should
have
the
opportunity
to
review.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
this
court
certainly
--
certainly
it
could,
yes
sir.
we've
--
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
do
--
we
do
not
feel
that
this
court
should
do
so.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
if
i
was
given
the
--
to
myself,
my
position
would
--
if
this
case
was
sent
back
to
the
states
attorney
--
i
mean
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
my
personal
position
speaking
as
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
state
of
texas,
would
be
that
man
should
be
--
of
course
he
is
already
in
a
hospital
but
he
should
be
examined
in
this
hospital
and
that
evidence
should
be
presented
at
the
trial.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
well,
that
possibility
has
been
discussed
for
one
week,
your
honor,
we
thought
of
everything
we
could
do.
we
thought
the
only
judic
--
there
is
no
judicial
remedy.
the
only
executive
remedy
would
be
to
pardon
the
man.
and
we
did
not
feel
that
under
the
condi
--
in
these
circumstances
he
should
be
pardoned.
that
here
is
a
man
that
the
record
shows
has
been
convicted
of
24
different
--
on
24
different
occasions.
we
did
not
feel
he
should
be
pardoned.
we
do
not
feel
that
he
was
denied
due
process
at
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
they're
about
to
prove
it,
your
honor.
if
--
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
that's
right.
your
honor
if
dr.
dial
has
prevailed
upon
the
court
at
the
time
of
trial,
this
man
would
have
been
sent
to
the
very
hospital
which
he
is
in
now.
perhaps
not,
that
would
--
he
might
have
been
at
the
terrell
state
hospital.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
that's
right.
and
he
would've
remained
in
that
hospital.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
yes.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
whether
it
would
be
terrell
hospital
or
rusk
hospital
but
i
say
it's
immaterial.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
they're
both
mental
--
state
mental
hospitals.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
the
rusk
hospital
is
for
the
criminally
insane
and
they
have
16
so-called
criminally
insane
people
in
the
hospital
and
i
don't
know,
i
would
roughly
guess
1500
noncriminals.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
in
the
same
hospital
receiving
the
same
treatment.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
the
same
--
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
no
sir.
that
was
my
--
at
first
blush,
that
was
my
argument
to
my
bosses,
but
i
do
not
feel
that
justice
prevails
--
would
prevail
under
that
contention.
i
feel
that
we'd
--
we've
got
to
concern
ourselves
with
was
or
was
not
this
man
given
a
trial,
a
fair
trial,
an
adequate
trial.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
oh
yes
sir,
we
do.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
well
we
do
but
that
is
the
only
argument
both
told
as
far
as
--
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
and
that
part
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
yes
sir
it
is.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
yes,
sir
it
is.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
no
sir,
he
couldn't.
this
court
of
civil
--
criminal
appeals
has
issued
its
mandate.
when
its
mandate
is
issued,
the
case
is
closed.
the
books
are
closed
and
sealed.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
oh
yes
sir.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
oh
yes,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
i
suppose
he
would
if
they
would
[inaudible]
him
from
the
state
hospital
to
--
for
the
purpose
of
the
hearing.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
oh
no.
he
is
--
as
a
matter
fact,
this
is
not
in
the
record
but
james
bush
was
the
guard
at
the
gate
of
this
--
the
prison
at
[inaudible].
he
is
not
a
violent
man.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court,
he
hated
to
leave
his
friends
in
[inaudible]
to
go
to
this
hospital.
i
could
stand
here
and
[inaudible]
the
question.
i
feel
that
this
man
was
accorded
a
fair
trial
that
irrespective
of
what
has
happened
since
and
it
erred
--
it
merely
--
it
is
postmarked
that
if
the
day
this
man
was
tried
for
two
times
he
had
hearings,
he
was
given
a
fair
trial.
now
the
record,
i
don't
--
i
think
the
record
is
being
read
in
a
bad
light
when
it
says
that
he
was
only
accorded
20
minutes
for
an
examination
by
dr.
dial.
the
attorney,
mr.
moore,
said,
your
honor,
“in
view
of
this,
i
would
like
to
make
the
motion
at
the
court
recess
in
order
to
allow
a
doctor,
we
have
got
to
examine
this
man,
who
hasn't
had
the
opportunity
before,
to
check
him
constantly
over
the
lunch
hour.
he
just
came
in.”
now
they
only
asked
that
he'd
be
checked
during
the
lunch
hour.
they
didn't
ask
that
could
we
have
a
couple
of
hours
or
three
hours.
they
said
could
he
be
checked
over
the
lunch
hour.
the
judge
says,
“rush
it
up
counselor.
how
long
would
it
take
you
to
get
your
job
--
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
rush
it
up,
counselor.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
assumed
--
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
i
believe
that
the
record
does
not
state
--
20
minutes
stands
out
in
my
mind.
there
was
--
the
lunch
hour
was
45
minutes.
he
must
have
decided
to
eat
25
minutes.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
that's
all
he
was
--
that's
all
he
had
but
that
is
--
he
was
not
denied
additional
time.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
now
--
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
no,
sir.
now
petitioner
contends
that
on
page
131
of
the
record,
there
is
a
request
for
more
time
and
let
me
read
that
if
i
may
on
page
134
--
131.
mr.
moore
is
speaking,
he
says,
“your
honor,
we
don't
have
any
witnesses,
but
we
would
like
to
move
that
the
court
suspend
the
proceedings
in
this
case
until
we
send
this
man
to
a
mental
institution
for
closer
observation,
or
in
the
alternative
we
would
move
that
the
court
appoint
a
psychiatrist
or
psychologist,
somebody
competent
in
mental
defects
to
examine
this
defendant
and
evaluate
his
mental
condition
in
view
of
the
previous
conviction
of
the
judgment
of
insanity
and
the
court
said
i
will
appoint
the
county
health
officer.”
i
think
petitioner's
brief
said
that
that
was
stated
in
gist
and
nobody
took
it
serious.
i
wasn't
there
but
the
record
reflects
the
seriousness
of
it
to
me.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
no.
no
sir.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
dr.
dial
got
all
the
time
to
examine
this
man
that
was
requested
by
his
defense
counsel.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
allo
b.
crow,
jr.
that
was
his
[inaudible].
thank
you
sir.
