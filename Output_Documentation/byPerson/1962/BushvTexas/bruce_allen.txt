mr.
bruce
allen
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bruce
allen
no,
your
honor,
i
would
say
this.
of
course
i'm
waxahachie,
not
in
austin.
this
was
made,
i
suppose,
in
huntsville
and
the
psychiatrist
who
made
the
examination,
made
that
i
assume
pursuant
to
a
request
by
the
people
there
in
the
penitentiary
after
they
had
knowledge
of
this
assertion
that
there
was
insanity.
they
had
the
man
examined
and
they
find
what's
in
the
brief
here
and
for
â€“
that's
about
all
i
know
about
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bruce
allen
i
don't
think
it
does,
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
question,
i
like
to
answer
that
now.
i
don't
think
it
has
any
legal
effect
whatever
for
the
reason
that
this
is
after
the
trial.
we
are
considering
here
now
whether
he
had
due
process
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
this
was
some
--
1963
that
this
examination
was
made.
when
the
first
examination
was
made
by
dr.
compton,
that
was
on
april
--
that
was
on
november
the
3rd,
1960.
the
second
time
he
saw
the
petitioner,
it
was
in
april,
april
21st,
1961.
now
doctor
hug
or
hug,
i
don't
know
the
pronunciation,
but
he
found
something
obviously
wrong
with
the
man,
but
he
doesn't
conclude
as
to
what
it's
caused
from.
he
says
it
could
be
some
emotional
something
or
it
could
be
some
organic
trouble
namely
maybe
arteriosclerosis
or
the
hardening
of
the
arteries.
now,
whatever
it
might
be
and
i
can
readily
see
that
it
could
have
been
arteriosclerosis
and
of
course
i
might
be
fast
in
it
because
dr.
compton
did
see
this
man
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
in
the
brief
they
tried
to
minimize
this
doctrine.
i
think
he's
a
very
fine,
capable
and
competent
licensed
physician,
medical
practitioner
and
who
has
had
training
in
--
and
study
in
psychiatrics.
there's
no
doubt
about
him
--
mr.
bruce
allen
yes
sir.
he
had
--
here's
his
exact
trade,
four
years
pre-med,
bailey
university,
four
years
in
university
of
texas
medical
school,
one
year
internship
in
new
york.
now,
how
much
training
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
know
how
much
he
had
insofar
as
medical
study
and
education
in
psychiatry,
but
in
the
record,
he
says
he
did
have
it.
mr.
bruce
allen
six
years
practice
in
which
he
--
mr.
bruce
allen
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
allen
i
believe
he's
had
four
to
six,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
allen
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
allen
that's
true
and
i
might
add
that
dr.
hug
is
not
a
member
of
the
board
of
--
the
american
board
of
psychiatry,
i
might
add
that,
but
doctor
compton
was
treating
minor
cases.
i'd
like
to
call
for
the
court's
attention
to
this
file
that
a
person
can
diagnose
and
not
have
to
be
nearly
as
well
equipped
if
he
were
to
treat.
here's
all
the
--
the
court
was
concerned
with
and
all
the
state
was
concerned
with
is
finding
out
whether
or
not
that
fellow
knew
right
from
wrong.
now
dr.
compton
doesn't
tell
that
he
didn't
examine
him
thoroughly.
i
don't
know,
the
record
doesn't
reflect
how
long
he
examined
that
first
time
in
his
office,
but
he
had
a
trial
on
the
merits
the
next
day
in
which
they
had
the
same
testimony
that
you
had
on
the
previous
trial
that
is
doctor
--
except
as
you
mr.
justice
stewart
observed.
he
didn't
have
dr.
dial
back
again
and
that's
the
thing
that
to
me
--
causes
me
to
wonder
why
he
was
not
back.
he
had
from
then
which
was
the
24th.
he
had
the
remainder
of
that
day
--
that
night
and
everyday
and
night
since
then
regardless
of
how
much
time
you
say
he
could
have
at
night,
he
had
that
time
until
the
27th
which
the
trial
was
concluded,
on
the
27th
in
the
afternoon.
mr.
bruce
allen
that's
true.
mr.
bruce
allen
30
miles.
mr.
bruce
allen
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
allen
southern
methodist
i
understand
he's
moved
on
to
pcu
that
--
that's
of
course
over
in
fortworth
and
i
think
a
very
capable
psychologist,
but
likewise
i
think
that
doctor
compton
is
well
equipped
to
diagnose
and
that's
all
he
was
concerned
with
and
i'd
like
to
say
now
that
--
mr.
bruce
allen
sure.
mr.
bruce
allen
sir?
mr.
bruce
allen
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
allen
well,
i
would
say
this,
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
this
particular
examination
was
made
not
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
whether
he
knew
right
or
wrong,
but
for
the
sole
and
only
purpose
of
sending
which
they
do
there
and
this
is
the
only
time
that
they
ever
examined
him
is
to
see
whether
or
not
he
should
be
sent
to
the
only
place
as
to
them
that
he
could
get
treatment
in
the
state
of
texas
would
be
this
mental
institution
where
he
could
really
get
proper
treatment.
now,
that's
the
only
purpose
for
this
examination.
he's
to
get
that
and
if
they
deemed
that
he
--
the
doctor
that
examined
him
deemed
that
he
needed
to
be
treated
then
as
was
done,
he
should
be
sent.
but
he
couldn't
have
had
that
previous
to
this
time,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
allen
well,
and
my
only
--
my
only
answer
to
that
is
this.
i
know
that
as
it's
been
observed
here,
that's
corroborative
of
the
fact
that
he
was
of
unsound
mind,
but
you
have
a
divergence
of
opinion
as
to
two
people.
now,
dr.
compton
saw
this
man.
dr.
compton
--
mr.
bruce
allen
i
would
have
to
say
this
--
mr.
bruce
allen
i
take
it
before
now
if
it's
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
you're
talking
about
--
mr.
bruce
allen
well,
i
understand,
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
allen
but
i
was
trying
to
--
trying
to
answer
your
question.
mr.
bruce
allen
now,
are
you
assuming
that
he's
still
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals?
mr.
bruce
allen
well,
now,
i
was
going
to
say
that
there
would
be
a
difference
--
mr.
bruce
allen
fine,
thank
you.
mr.
bruce
allen
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
just
before
we
went
to
lunch,
i
believe
that
the
only
procedure
under
texas
law
that
could
be
had
if
--
would
be
--
would
necessarily
have
to
be
in
con
--
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
have
to
remand
to
the
district
court
of
ellis
county,
texas
to
proceed
consistent
with
the
opinion
or
judgment
reached
by
this
court.
i
think
there
is
in
a
criminal
case,
there
is
no
other
procedure.
now,
there
is
if
the
person
--
mr.
bruce
allen
at
that
particular
time,
i
think
that
had
this
come
to
light
previous
to
that
it
could
--
a
motion
could
have
been
filed
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
the
case
dismissed,
i
mean
the
state
could
have
done
that
had
they
known
it.
mr.
bruce
allen
well,
now
again,
mr.
justice
white
i
think
that
--
mr.
bruce
allen
that
would
depend
upon
the
time
that
it
was
done.
mr.
bruce
allen
well,
there
just
wouldn't
be
any
authorization
for
it
if
it
were
made
too
late.
i
mean,
if
time
had
already
--
mr.
bruce
allen
sir?
mr.
bruce
allen
i
think
we
have
a
motion
within
15
days
to
file
a
motion
rehearing.
mr.
bruce
allen
and
if
it's
not
done,
my
--
i
think
the
time
has
already
passed.
mr.
bruce
allen
well,
they
--
unless
you
instruct
them,
i
feel
the
reading
was
sure
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
not
say
that
a
compton
--
a
medical
practitioner
who
is
trained
in
psychiatry,
who
is
trained
in
psychiatry
and
who
has
treated
a
patients.
mr.
bruce
allen
well,
i
maybe
wrong
but
i
don't
think
that
will
get
what
you
think
it
would
get,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
bruce
allen
if
i
were
giving
you
my
honest
opinion,
i
think
it
is
impossible
so
far
as
that
court's
concern
under
procedure,
but
i
think
that
of
course
as
this
court
well
knows
that
if
and
when
you
say
it,
they
do
identically.
mr.
bruce
allen
well,
i
say
i
don't
think
this
--
mr.
bruce
allen
well,
i
know
we
only
have
the
rules
that
--
as
i
just
gave
to
mr.
justice
white
and
that
is
that
--
i
really
don't
think
there
is
such
a
rule.
mr.
bruce
allen
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
allen
we
have
a
board
of
pardon
and
parole
and
this
happened
down
there.
incidentally
they
could
do
nothing
except
with
the
board
of
pardon
and
parole,
recommend
to
the
governor
that
he
pardon
him
and
the
government
so
acts
--
governor
so
acts.
mr.
bruce
allen
none
at
all,
not
at
all.
mr.
bruce
allen
true.
that's
right.
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
allen
yes
sir.
well,
i
just
say
this,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
don't
think
it
could
be
done
the
way
the
court
has
indicated,
but
i
think
clearly,
if
it
could
be
done
the
way
the
court
writing
on
it
or
in
telling
him,
we'd
have
to
abide
by
the
--
what
this
court
says.
mr.
bruce
allen
yes.
mr.
bruce
allen
well
as
i
said,
i
answered
mr.
goldberg
just
before
lunch.
i
--
actually,
this
man
is
over
in
rusk
state
mental
institution
as
a
result
of
this,
your
honor
and
without
it
he
would
still
be
in
the
penitentiary.
he
is
now
there
getting
treatment.
mr.
bruce
allen
come
back
to
--
come
back
--
well
--
mr.
bruce
allen
come
back
to
the
penitentiary
under
the
present
setup.
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
allen
come
back,
yes,
sir,
he
does.
mr.
bruce
allen
he
don't
come
back
to
the
penitentiary.
mr.
bruce
allen
oh
no.
it
does
not.
in
fact,
this
is
--
he
can
get
out
with
a
little
over
eight
years.
i
don't
say
that
this
fellow
would.
he's
had
a
crime
record
there.
if
we
--
the
court
is
well
aware
of
under
this
record
and
if
the
particular
time
that
he
had
this
judgment
entered
insanity
over
in
america
in
which
he
joins
us.
there
were
three
indictments
pending
at
that
particular
time
for
felony
offences,
and
there
was
no
medical
testimony
that
sent
him
to
the
state
institution
at
that
particular
time.
in
fact,
the
only
testimony
that
appears
was
a
tf
bush
who
i
assume
was
a
kinsman
either
father
or
brother
or
someone.
mr.
bruce
allen
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
allen
it's
alright.
mr.
bruce
allen
right.
mr.
bruce
allen
indeed,
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
allen
i
don't.
i
mean,
i
really
don't.
i
don't
want
to
take
issue
with
some
of
the
members
of
this
honorable
body,
but
this
is
a
postmortem
if
you
please,
at
the
very
time
that
we
had
the
prisoner
there,
immediately
after
he
was
arrested,
he
was
examined
and
as
i
say
by
a
very
competent
man.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
if
any
member
of
this
court
to
talk
with
him
and
know
that
he
was
a
very
competent
man.
and
they
--
and
he
examined
him.
i
don't
know
how
long.
it
doesn't
appear,
but
it
wasn't
one
of
those
quick
jobs
because
i'll
say
this
to
the
court
and
this
is
outside
the
record,
i've
sent
two
to
the
penitentiary,
i
mean
to
the
state
hospital,
predicated
on
this
same
doctor's
opinion.
i
sent
them
there
myself
as
i
did
this
one.
i
knew
this
judgment
was
pending.
i've
sent
them
over
there
as
the
law
authorized
and
that
this
man
is
required
to
do
examining,
not
for
the
purpose
of
treating
him,
solely
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
this
question,
did
he
know
right
from
wrong?
was
he
mentally
equipped
at
the
time
to
know
right
from
wrong?
and
i
think
it
is
--
if
this
court
holds
in
this
case
that
a
psychiatrist
is
necessary
it's
going
to
really
impose
a
burden
upon
this
court
in
the
future
as
i
see
it.
because
these
states
that
do
not
have
such
a
requirement
either
one
of
which
is
texas,
medical
testimony
is
sufficient
to
determine
the
question
of
right
or
wrong
theory
under
the
mcnabb
rule.
so,
if
this
court
holds
that
a
psychiatrist
is
necessary
before
a
person
has
had
due
process
on
their
constitution,
you
talk
about
lots
of
work
and
lots
of
foolish
petitions,
they're
coming
for.
mr.
bruce
allen
i
would.
i
would
certainly
agree
with
that.
i
think
the
common
law
rule
is
to
that
effect.
it's
a
rule
in
texas.
we
don't
have
to
have
any
medical
testimony.
but
here
--
mr.
bruce
allen
i
take
that
position
here?
mr.
bruce
allen
no,
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
he
--
we
did
have
a
medical
practitioner
who's
trained
in
psychiatry
and
who
treats
mental
cases
that
--
they're
minor
cases.
he
had
judgment
enough
in
a
difficult
mental
case.
he
would
reaffirm
to
the
specialists
there
in
dallas,
but
the
fact
of
business
is
most
of
these
small
counties
as
mine,
we
don't
have
psychiatrists.
you
just
don't
have
them.
it's
wonderful
in
new
york.
they
have
more
in
new
york
than
they
do
all
the
rest
the
united
--
the
states,
the
united
states
put
together,
and
that's
fine.
it's
wonderful
in
massachusetts,
pennsylvania,
where
they
have
lots
of
them.
we
don't
have
399
and
half
of
those
are
in
mental
institutions
and
i
might
add
half
of
them
are
not
any
better
equipped
than
dr.
compton
as
a
matter
of
fact
because
of
education.
mr.
bruce
allen
that's
true.
i
think
i
would
agree
with
that
statement,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
allen
well,
i
will
say
this.
if
after
the
county
health
officer
examined
him
and
this
is
--
this
has
been
done
incidentally,
after
the
county
health
officer
examined
him
and
reaches
the
conclusion
that
he
is
in
such
a
mental
state
that
he
doesn't
know
right
or
wrong
then
i
can
get
a
psychiatrist
and
brought
and
brought
down
from
dallas
and
examine
him
or
take
him
up
there.
and
--
mr.
bruce
allen
i
wouldn't
think
i
have
that
authority
you
honor
because
i
never
have
done
it
and
i
never
thought
that
i
had
it.
now,
i
have
sent
it
to
them
and
they
found
them
insane.
he
said
they
were
insane
at
the
time
and
there
wasn't
any
doubt
in
my
mind.
i
didn't
there'd
be
any
doubt
in
the
think
it
could
be
any
doubt
in
the
mind
of
the
jury
we
just
had
a
jury
impaneled
as
we
did
in
this
case
on
the
24th
and
let
them
reach
that
conclusion
predicated
upon
the
county
health
officer's
testimony
that
the
particular
people
were
insane.
mr.
bruce
allen
yes
sir,
i
did.
mr.
bruce
allen
no
sir.
i've
never
had
any
--
i
didn't
even
know,
i've
never
talk
to
him
and
actually
that's
it.
mr.
bruce
allen
i
sure
did.
i
had
a
copy
the
minute
i
argue
--
but
you
don't
know
how
it
is,
mr.
clark,
like
in
those
rural
areas.
we
know
the
different
people
and
the
officers
know
and
so
they
brought
to
my
attention
that
he
had
been
committed
to
an
institution.
that's
the
reason
then
that
i
had
dr.
compton
to
see
him
on
november
the
3rd,
right
after
the
court.
i
don't
--
i
feel
like
it's
my
duty
just
as
much
to
see
that
justice
is
done
for
this
man
as
it
would
be
for
the
state.
after
all,
i'm
not
a
--
i'm
not
bad,
[inaudible]
i
don't
get
any
pleasure
out
of
it
in
fact.
mr.
bruce
allen
i'm
glad
you
asked
that.
we
had
the
burden,
the
state
and
i'll
say
this
to
this
honorable
court.
i
would've
--
would
not
have
been
surprised
with
the
jury
in
the
first
preliminary
trial
of
finding
him
insane.
mr.
bruce
allen
a
presumption
that
its
continues
as
its
found
in
professor
wright's
brief
that
--
mr.
bruce
allen
once
--
sorry,
once
instructed
--
was
instructed
and
that
they
--
that
we
had
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
was
insane
on
tuesday.
we
had
that
jury
trial
on
the
24th
and
after
that
--
mr.
bruce
allen
was
sane,
beyond
unreasonable
doubt,
and
i
find
it
preponderous
like
as
usual
in
the
cases,
civil
mattered,
but
in
this
kind
of
a
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
his
sanity.
and
that
was
--
so
not
only
in
the
preliminary
trial,
but
also
in
the
trial
on
his
merits.
and
i
think
that
to
me
what
professor
wright
is
urging
here
is
fine
and
i
couldn't
be
more
in
harmony
if
that
is
with
what
ought
all
to
be
done.
it's
a
fine
thing
if
we
could
have
a
dr.
manager
and
dr.
overhaulsor
and
these
fine
psychiatrists
to
study
and
treat
all
patients,
but
this
is,
as
i
see
it,
is
not
the
question
here.
the
question
here
is,
didn't
he
know
a
right
from
wrong.
the
question
here
is
was
due
process
denied?
we
submit
that
--
actually
under
the
facts
even
--
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
this
man
examined
him
in
huntsville.
we
maintain
that
even
so,
that
the
man
at
the
day
in
question,
november
the
--
i
mean,
april
24th,
1961,
april
25th
or
27th
of
1961
that
he
received
due
process
of
the
law
that
he
got
everything
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
accord
him.
mr.
bruce
allen
dr.
compton
mr.
bruce
allen
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
allen
i'll
say
this.
i'm
not
sure
that
other
than
what
defense
counsel
asked
and
never
told
him
and
i'm
not
sure
that
he
knew
that
precautions.
mr.
bruce
allen
well
listen,
i'm
not
--
i'd
say
this
now
in
that
connection
mr.
justice
stewart,
immediately
after
his
arrest,
he
carried
it
--
and
it's
in
the
record.
he
carried
the
sheriff
to
a
remote
place
over
in
tarrant
county
near
arlington
where
he
had
hid
some
of
these
very
things
that
he
--
i
mean,
some
of
these
coins,
burned
the
cabinet
which
it
was
in,
beat
it
up,
and
it
was
introduced
in
court.
there
is
a
man
that
immediately
after
it
had
happened
carries
him
there,
and
that
i
dare
say
that
the
sheriff
couldn't
have
found
that
place
without
him
taking
him
to
it
but
--
mr.
bruce
allen
well,
it's
not
in
the
record.
i'll
say
this;
he
did
sell
lots
of
it.
mr.
bruce
allen
oh,
indeed,
he
did.
he
got
money
for
it.
that
bailiff
[inaudible]
that
he
stole
back
there
in
1924
and
he
stole
new
over
in
another
county.
he
just
--
his
record
is
just
full
of
sales
where
he
had
stolen
personal
property.
mr.
bruce
allen
sir?
mr.
bruce
allen
well,
i
think
that's
right,
his
motive
was
like
that.
mr.
bruce
allen
well,
i
would
say
this,
mr.
goldberg,
i
think
that
dr.
dial
had
and
i
think
he's
a
very
--
i
think
probably
a
dedicated
man,
if
i
were
to
guess
it,
i
was
surprised
he'd
be
paid
with
gasoline.
mr.
bruce
allen
well,
i'd
say
this.
i
don't
know
what
time
we
came
back
after
lunch.
i
really
don't.
i
remember
we
went
late,
but
i
don't
know
what
time
we
came
back.
i
--
but
--
mr.
bruce
allen
well,
i
didn't
figure
he
would
refer
to
him,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bruce
allen
no,
i
didn't
refer
he
was
--
i
didn't
think
he
was
referring
to
him
at
all.
i
think
that
probably
he
--
mr.
bruce
allen
the
court
probably
reached
the
same
conclusion
i
did
that
the
man
was
very
dedicated
and
was
a
real
good
psychologist
and
i
think
he
was,
but
he
is
not
a
licensed
practitioner
of
medicine.
as
this
court
well
knows
that
he
is
a
doctor
of
philosophy
and
has
had
some
training
in
psychology
and
teaches
over
in
southern
methodist
university.
mr.
bruce
allen
well
--
mr.
bruce
allen
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
bruce
allen
no.
but
he
was
not
--
mr.
bruce
allen
he
was
not
cut-off
as
a
matter
of
fact
from
giving
his
opinion.
in
due
and
if
you
think
that
on
the
21st,
the
motion
was
filed,
that
defense
counsel
was
appointed
three
weeks
and
defense
counsel
is
a
graduate
of
southern
methodist
university.
and
actually,
he
had
ample
time
even
before
he
filed
his
motion.
i
don't
know
what
it
was.
what
he
did,
i
don't
know
(inaudible).
mr.
bruce
allen
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
allen
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
allen
that's
true,
except
i
don't
know
how
long
the
lunch
recess
was.
mr.
bruce
allen
well
i'm
--
to
my
best
[inaudible]
term
but
i'd
agree
it
wasn't
too
long.
mr.
bruce
allen
now,
my
position
is
that
he
had
plenty
of
time
before
that,
not
that
particular
day
at
noon
because
the
jury
in
texas,
i
wish
it
we're
not
told
their
last
stop,
and
no
air
conditioner
in
some
of
the
rooms
and
i
expect
the
judge
was
thinking
lots
about
the
12
jurors
when
he
was
--
not
wanting
to
keep
them
there
for
some
three
hours
because
he
can't
release
him
under
texas
law.
mr.
bruce
allen
not
that
i
know
of.
i
believe
that
was
on
the
part
of
--
it
may
request
you
people
or
somebody
requested
it,
nobody
requested
for
us,
that
i
know
of.
mr.
bruce
allen
well,
that's
what
i
want
to
say,
they
keep
a
lot
of
staff
there
and
if
they
don't
have
any
air
condition
in
the
building
in
--
at
all
and
i
understand.
i
don't
know
--
i
know
that
the
judge
is
very
eager
to
get
the
jury,
lose
and
get
him
going,
so
they'd
go
back
home.
sometimes
i
--
i'd
would
say
this,
i'd
love
to
have
them
all
the
time.
