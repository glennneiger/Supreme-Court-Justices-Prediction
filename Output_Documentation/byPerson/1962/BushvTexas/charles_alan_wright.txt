mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
raises
the
question
first,
whether
the
state
of
texas
denied
the
petitioner
merely
because
he
is
poor,
an
adequate
opportunity
to
sustain
a
plea
of
insanity.
it
raises
beyond
that,
if
in
fact
that’s
what
happened,
made
the
state
do
this
consistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
the
state
of
texas.
petitioner
was
convicted
of
the
crime
of
felony
theft
of
having
stolen
a
coin
collection
valued
at
about
$600
from
his
employer.
as
habitual
criminal,
the
sentence
was
laid.
there
is
no
issue
here
in
regard
whether
the
crime
was
committed
or
any
matter
of
that
sort.
the
entire
issue
here
has
to
do
with
the
proceedings
to
determine
his
plea
that
he
was
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
or
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
therefore
not
competent
to
stand
in
the
trial.
the
facts
with
regard
to
that
issue
are
these:
petitioner
was
arrested
and
incarcerated
in
october
of
1960.
he
was
indicted
in
february
of
1961
and
trial
set
for
late
april
1961.
three
weeks
before
trial,
because
the
petitioner
was
indigent,
the
court
appointed
an
attorney
to
represent
him.
that
attorney
on
april
21st,
1961,
three
days
before
the
case
was
set
for
trial,
made
two
motions
for
the
trial
court.
in
each
motion,
counsel
recited
that
the
petitioner
was
indigent,
that
he
was
without
means
to
acquire
expert
assistance
to
sustain
his
plea
of
insanity.
in
one
motion
he
asked
that
the
petitioner
be
committed
to
a
state
mental
hospital
for
examination
and
observation
of
his
mental
condition.
in
the
other
motion,
he
asked
the
court
to
appoint
a
psychiatrist
or
that
it
provide
funds
to
retain
a
psychiatrist
to
assist
the
defense
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'd
be
very
glad,
justice
stewart,
to
tell
you
that
immediately.
the
supplemental
brief
which
was
filed
i
think
sometime
in
the
end
of
last
week,
i
saw
it
on
sunday,
sets
out
two
things.
it
sets
out
a
report
of
a
dr.
hug,
a
state
psychiatrist
to
examine
the
petitioner
at
the
state
penitentiary,
the
date
is
not
shown
in
the
supplemental
brief,
but
the
date
was
february
6th,
as
the
original
of
this
report
indicates
of
this
year.
doctor
hug
reports
that
the
petitioner
suffers
from
simple
schizophrenia
and
that
he
has
been
not
responsible
or
best
partial
responsible
for
his
actions
for
many
years.
exhibit
b
of
the
supplemental
brief,
his
statement,
that
under
the
statutory
procedure
which
we
have
in
texas,
the
director
of
prisons
has
had
the
petitioner
transferred
from
the
state
prison
to
the
state
mental
hospital.
now,
the
court
asked,
what
effect
does
this
have
on
this
case?
in
my
view,
your
honor,
it
has
none.
it
does
not
make
the
case
moot
and
this,
i
take
it,
was
the
only
purpose
for
which
a
document
of
this
sort
might
properly
be
brought
before
the
court
at
this
late
stage.
petitioner
still
stands
under
a
criminal
conviction.
he
still
is
subject
to
being
returned
to
prison.
in
fact,
the
same
statute
under
which
he
was
transferred
on
i
believe
thursday
of
last
week
to
the
mental
hospital,
article
932-1
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
goes
on
to
provide
in
section
15,
that
if
at
any
time
the
director
of
the
mental
hospital
finds
that
he
has
been
cured
or,
and
i
think
this
maybe
more
important
in
this
case,
if
he
finds
that
the
prisoner
will
not
benefit
from
continued
hospitalization,
in
that
event,
the
prisoner
shall
be
returned
to
penitentiary
to
serve
the
unexpired
portion
of
the
sentence.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
october
21st,
1960.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
is
surely
that
--
if
we'd
that
finding
at
the
time
of
the
trial
as
we
asked,
i
think,
we
would
never
have
been
here.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
we
do
have
it
now.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
entirely
clear.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
so
far
as
i'm
advised,
mr.
justice
white,
and
since
i
received
the
brief
on
sunday,
i'm
not
fully
briefed
on
the
point,
but
as
best
i
can
determine,
i
can
find
no
collateral
procedure
available
under
texas
law
by
which
this
can
be
brought
up.
there
is
a
recent
case,
february
--
1959
of
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
which
on
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
it
was
undertaken
to
show
that
lately
discovered
evidence
indicated
that
a
person
had
been
insane
at
the
time
of
the
act
or
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
held
that
this
is
not
a
matter
which
may
be
raised
by
this
form
of
collateral
attack.
that
case,
your
honor,
is
ex
parte
elkins
at
324
s.w.2d
1.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
attorney
general
perhaps
can
speak
with
more
authority
as
to
what
course
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
take.
in
that
event,
there
are
a
few
guideposts,
i
think.
we
have
a
statute
in
texas
which
provides
that
if
after
convictions
and
during
the
time
that
an
appeal
is
pending
and
that
i
take
it
this
present
time,
there
should
be
reason
to
suspect
the
sanity
of
the
convicted
person
then
the
proceedings
may
be
suspended
and
the
person
may
be
committed
to
a
mental
hospital
until
such
time
to
see
he
is
well.
but
the
statute
is
very
clear,
it's
article
932
(b)
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure,
section
3,
that
during
the
period
that
the
person
is
so
confined,
he
is
to
be
confined
as
a
person
charged
with
a
criminal
offense
and
that
upon
his
release
from
the
mental
hospital,
the
criminal
proceeding
continues
just
as
it
would
before.
further
in
that
connection,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
held
this
is
a
matter
which
not
--
may
not
be
raised
before
yet,
the
case
there
is
gibbs
versus
texas
at
308
s.w.2d
515,
where
an
application
was
made
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
the
case
then
pending
before
it
that
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
the
prisoner
is
insane,
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
this
is
not
a
matter
for
us,
this
is
a
matter
only
for
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
justice
white,
i
can't
answer
that
with
regards
to
this
case
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
absolutely.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
is
clearly
one
of
the
issues.
i
should
say
that's
the
central
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
was
a
petition,
mr.
justice
clark,
for
habeas
corpus
alleging
that
he
had
not
had
a
lawyer.
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
by
divided
vote
read
this
court's
decision
in
massey
v.
moore
as
meaning
that
there
must
be
a
lawyer
in
the
case
of
a
criminal
defendant
who
is
presumptively
insane
and
therefore
vacated
the
conviction
because
of
lack
of
counsel,
it
was
not
because
of
his
mental
state
except
in
the
record.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
gibbs
v.
texas,
it's
308
s.w.2d
515,
it's
a
1958
decision.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
--
that
is
--
in
part,
i
think,
a
very
accurate
statement
of
my
present
state
of
knowledge
mr.
justice
brennan.
my
guess
is
that,
if
you
vacate
it
and
send
it
back,
we'll
find
it
back
here
again
because
the
--
there
is
no
procedure
in
texas.
but
i
cannot
say
that
with
assurance.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
should
like
to
believe,
mr.
justice
black,
texas
procedure
is
flexible
enough
so
that
it
can
provide
some
redress
under
those
circumstances.
so
far
as
i
had
yet
found
or
have
been
advised,
we
have
not
discovered
what
procedure
that
could
be.
if
the
court
is
concerned
as
quite
properly,
i
know
it
must
be
with
this,
we'd
likely
to
submit
after
argument
a
supplemental
brief
on
the
question
of
what
procedures
might
be
available
in
texas
and
if
there
is
any
purpose
to
be
served
by
remand
to
the
texas
court.
there's
not
in
one
day
washington
had
the
opportunity
to
brief
that
question
we
should
like.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
depends
entirely
on
what
doctor
hug
means
by
many
years
and
also
what
he
means
when
he
says
at
most
partially
responsible,
whether
or
not
this
could
be
sufficient
responsibility
to
meet
the
right
or
wrong
test
of
the
texas
statutes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there
were
two
findings,
mr.
justice
clark,
on
two
successive
days,
two
different
juries
found
him
to
--
insane
both
at
the
time
of
the
event
and
at
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
can
be
helpful
[inaudible]
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
mr.
justice
clark,
i
would
have
a
hard
time
persuading
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
but
a
doctor's
report
in
1963
demonstrates
that
the
court
committed
error
in
1961
in
making
the
finding
which
it
did.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
significance
of
doctor
hug's
report
is
that
it
demonstrates
the
danger
of
having
permitted
this
trial
to
go
ahead
without
giving
the
petitioner
the
psychiatric
assistance
which
he
then
asked
for.
we
now
know
that
there
is
serious
reason
to
believe
that
the
petitioner
is
insane.
they
would
have
known
that
if
we
had
had
the
relief
for
which
we
moved
at
the
trial.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
was
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
advised,
mr.
justice
clark,
that
there
was
a
district
court,
yes,
in,
i
believe
johnson
county.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
it
is.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
this
is
in
ellis
county.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
states
--
if
the
court
wishes
to
listen
to
argument
on
the
merits
at
this
time,
the
state's
position
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
they
gave
petitioner
an
adequate
opportunity
to
sustain
his
plea
of
insanity
that
the
county
health
officer
testified.
in
our
view,
this
is
even
without
these
late
revelations
from
doctor
hug,
a
demonstrably
inadequate
way
to
put
to
a
jury
the
facts
as
to
the
mental
condition
of
the
person
who
stands
accused
of
the
crime.
and
i
think
that
this
is
demonstrated
in
a
number
of
ways.
it
is
demonstrated
by
testimony
in
the
record,
dr.
dial,
the
psychologist
called
by
trial
counsel
testified
at
page
70
that
the
adequacy
of
a
mental
examination
depends
upon
the
training
of
the
person
who
is
made
at
--
dr.
compton,
the
county
health
officer
had
no
specialized
training
in
psychiatry.
he's
a
general
practitioner
who
would
--
had
a
course
in
psychiatry
in
medical
school
and
he
test--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
gasoline.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
gathered
from
dallas,
that's
a
given.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
the
fact,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
as
mr.
moore
stated
reflects
--
he
had
just
come
into
the
courtroom
at
that
time
mr.
moore
asked
for
the
recess,
the
judge
said,
“rush
it
up.”
counsel
was
given
a
45
minute
recess,
during
that
time
the
prisoner
was
also
fed
ad
the
examination
according
to
dr.
dial's
own
testimony
that
was
actually
20
minutes
which
he
says
is
inadequate.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there
is
that
question
in
the
case,
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
trial
judge
in
qualifying
the
bill
of
exceptions
after
the
trial
at
page
38
of
the
record
refers
to
dr.
dial,
a
supposed
expert
and
says
that
he
had
ample
time
to
make
whatever
examination
he
needed
to
make,
that's
after
dr.
dial
had
testified
that
his
examination
was
entirely
inadequate.
this
i
think
is
the
answer
to
the
suggestion
on
the
state's
brief
that
if
counsel
had
seriously
wanted
him
to
have
expert
testimony,
they
should
have
moved
for
further
continuance
with
some
inference
that
it
would
have
been
granted.
as
i
read
the
record,
the
inferences
are
entirely
the
other
way.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
your
honor,
the
motion
was
made.
it
was
made
during
the
trial
in
the
merits
in
april
25th.
mr.
moore
moved
that
proceedings
to
be
continued
and
in
order
to
permit
examination
by
a
psychiatrist
or
a
psychologist.
the
court
said,
“i
appoint
the
county
health
officer,”
dr.
compton
who
had
already
testified
and
who
was
neither,
mr.
moore
said,
“this
is
not
satisfactory,
we
want
someone
trained
in
diseases
of
the
mind”,
and
the
court
said,
“your
request
is
overruled.”
so
the
request
was
duly
made
that
there'd
be
a
continuance
for
that
purpose.
if
dr.
dial's
testimony
as
to
the
adequacy
of
training,
being
vital
in
determining
the
adequacy
of
the
examination
were
not
enough,
we
have
in
our
brief
at
pages
10
to
14
listed
a
great
many
other
authorities
from
isaac
ray,
a
pioneer
psychiatrist
in
1838
down
to
the
present,
authorities
both
psychiatric,
legal
judicial
expressing
the
view
that
a
general
practitioner
is
not
qualified
to
give
expert
testimony
on
this
question.
i
hope
on
that
that
my
view
is
very
clear
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
has
perhaps
misunderstood
what
we're
contending.
we
are
not
suggesting
at
all,
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
the
testimony
of
lay
witnesses
or
testimony
of
a
general
practitioner
is
inadmissible
in
such
a
proceeding.
whatever
may
be
the
desirable
evidence
rule,
this
is
surely
a
matter
which
the
states
must
regulate
themselves.
it
is
our
contention
that
this
evidence
however
much
may
have
is
not
sufficient
to
provide
what
the
constitution
does
require
and
that
is
an
adequate
opportunity
to
sustain
the
plea
of
insanity.
and
so
we
say,
what
dr.
compton
testify
if
you
want,
but
make
available
to
the
court
and
the
jury
and
defense
counsel
testimony
of
a
person
who
is
trained
and
who
is
able
to
give
a
truly
expert
opinion
on
the
subject.
that
we
think
was
not
present
in
this
case.
if
there
were
any
further
doubt
as
to
dr.
compton's
testimony,
i
think
that
he
perhaps
gives
the
answer
himself.
he
demonstrates
that
he
is
not
trained
to
make
the
determination
of
this
kind
when
he
had
testified
at
page
135
of
the
record
that
he
made
the
same
sort
of
examination
a
psychiatrist
would
have
made,
except
with
regard
to
physical
examination.
now
the
record
shows,
the
medical
text
show,
judicial
opinion
show
that
the
kind
of
examination
he
made
would
consist
of
only
three
things;
a
history,
a
history
so
incomplete
that
he
did
not
find
out
that
the
petitioner
had
been
adjudicated
insane
in
1924.
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
prisoner
suffered
from
hallucinations,
and
simple
test
of
orientations
such
as
whether
he
knew
who
is
the
president
of
the
united
states,
the
record
shows
that
this
is
not
what
psychiatrists
do,
that
a
psychiatric
examination
requires
physical
examination,
intelligence
test,
electroencephalogram,
test
such
the
rorschach
test,
as
well
as
verbal
test
and
a
good
many
other
varieties
described
in
the
record
by
dr.
dial
and
described
by
other
authorities
in
our
briefs.
on
the
assumption,
arguendo
that
the
examination
which
was
made
was
not
an
adequate
examination,
what
is
the
constitutional
requirement
here?
on
this
point,
there
is
very
little
law.
the
only
case
from
this
court
in
point
is
u.s.
ex
rel
smith
v.
baldie
and
although
both
sides
managed
to
find
comfort
in
various
parts
of
the
language
of
the
smith
case,
in
fact,
the
smith
case
does
not
on
any
view
control
this.
smith
was
a
habeas
corpus
action
attacking
a
pennsylvania
conviction.
in
the
smith
case,
psychiatrist
had
testified,
the
state
psychiatrist,
dr.
drayton,
who
unfortunately
was
probably
insane
at
the
time
he
testified
and
two
psychiatrists
called
by
the
defense.
the
contention
which
was
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
here
was
that
further
psychiatrist
should
have
been
appointed
in
order
to
assist
the
defense.
that
contention
was
rejected.
there
was
doubt
as
to
whether
a
proper
request
had
been
made
even
assuming
the
request
had
been
made.
this
court,
speaking
through
mr.
justice
reed
said
first,
“we
cannot
say
that
the
state
has
this
duty
by
constitutional
mandate”
and
this
language
is
very
comforting
to
the
state,
but
the
court
went
on
to
say,
the
language
which
comforts
petitioner,
psychiatrist
testified
that
suffices.
and
that
i
think
puts
smith
quite
aside
from
our
case,
where
there
was
no
psychiatric
testimony,
unlike
smith,
where
there
was
testimony
for
both
sides
by
a
psychiatrist.
we
find
constitutional
support
for
our
position
in
three
separate
lines
of
argument
which
we
hope
converge
the
same
conclusion.
the
first
is
simply
the
due
process
clause,
that
there
is
no
fundamental
fairness
if
a
man
is
asked
to
stand
trial
without
the
kind
of
testimony
which
every
professional
group,
every
learned
writer,
a
great
many
courts,
legislatures
more
the
half
of
the
states
say
is
necessary
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
is
sane.
this
is
a
proceeding
so
fundamentally
unfair
as
to
constitute
a
violation
of
due
process.
but
we
add
specificity
to
that
argument
by
looking
to
the
right
of
counsel.
surely
here
was
a
case
as
the
texas
court
held
in
ex
parte
bush
in
1958
where
there
was
a
constitutional
right
to
counsel
no
matter
what
variation
of
betts
v.
brady
one
accepts,
this
was
a
case
where
counsel
must
to
be
appointed.
what
then
does
the
right
of
counsel
mean?
surely
it
would
not
be
enough
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
powell
v.
alabama
to
name
as
counsel
for
an
indigent,
mr.
lewis,
though
he's
quite
learned
in
the
law
because
he's
not
a
lawyer.
it
would
not
be
enough
to
name
a
lawyer
who
does
not
do
a
competent
job.
now,
we
didn't
have
either
of
those
in
our
case.
the
state
in
its
brief
refers
to
the
able
and
astute
counsel
for
the
defendant,
a
mr.
moore
who
was
the
trial
counsel,
i
think
fully
merited
those
compliments
in
the
best
tradition
of
the
profession
representing
a
defendant.
but
what
is
mr.
moore
to
do
as
trial
counsel
for
an
indigent
if
he
had
been
appointed
to
represent
a
deaf
mute
to
use,
judge
biggs
example,
and
had
not
been
furnished
with
an
interpreter,
there
is
no
way
he
could
exercise
this
professional
talents,
no
way
in
which
he
could
provide
effective
assistance
to
the
petitioner.
similarly
here,
he
is
asked
to
defend
a
man
where
the
--
virtually
the
only
issue
in
the
case
is
the
issue
of
the
man's
insanity
and
he
has
to
do
it
without
any
professional
help.
he
has
to
do
it
without
any
testimony
which
even
he
can
cross
examine
which
is
truly
competent
to
qualify.
now
it
is
true,
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
pointed
out,
that
the
trial
counsel
was
able
to
obtain
dr.
dial,
a
professor
of
psychology
at
southern
methodist
university
obtained
for
the
trial.
it
is
true
also
that
because
of
the
action
of
the
court,
the
examination
by
dr.
dial
was
entirely
an
inadequate
examination,
a
20-minute
examination
from
which
he
said
he
could
draw
no
conclusions.
and
the
state
in
their
brief
suggest
that
since
it
is
a
principle
of
medical
ethics
that
the
indigent
always
have
a
call
on
doctors
that
the
counsel
should
--
could
surely
have
gone
out
and
found
a
doctor,
a
psychiatrist
to
testify
if
he
wanted
to.
i
think
there
is
variety
of
answers,
if
the
court
please,
to
that
argument
that
this
is
to
me
is
the
most
helpful
answer
to
it.
it
is
also
a
principle
of
legal
ethics
that
the
indigent
have
a
call
on
the
services
of
lawyers
and
yet
we
do
not
ask
that
an
indigent
defendant
go
out
and
find
his
own
lawyer.
the
constitution
puts
the
responsibility
on
the
trial
court
to
obtain
a
lawyer
to
help
the
indigent
defendant.
and
we
argue
similarly
that
it
should
not
be
for
the
court
appointed
counsel
to
go
out
and
beg
and
hunt
for
a
doctor
that
if
a
doctor
is
a
constitutional
requirement
then
it
is
the
court,
the
impartial
administrator
of
justice
which
should
carry
the
duty
of
making
the
doctor
available,
not
the
counsel.
finally,
if
the
court
please,
we
argue
from
the
implications
of
griffin
v.
illinois
where
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black
for
a
plurality
of
the
court
said
that
there
could
be
no
equal
justice
where
the
kind
of
trial
a
man
gets
depends
on
the
amount
of
money
he
has
and
this,
i
submit,
is
precisely
the
situation.
no
one
doubts
that
a
defendant
of
means
in
texas
will
have
psychiatric
examination
and
psychiatric
testimony
even
if
there
are
as
the
state
shows
psychiatrists
in
only
34
of
our
254
counties,
the
psychiatrist
will
be
there
if
there
is
a
wealthy
defendant.
and
if
the
psychiatrist
is
there
for
the
defendant
the
state
somehow,
i
suggest,
will
have
counsel
there,
a
psychiatrist
there
also.
the
only
reason
there
was
not
a
psychiatrist
testifying
the
case
of
state
against
bush
was
because
bush
was
too
poor
to
hire
a
psychiatrist.
and
that
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
can
accept
that
sentence
from
griffin
at
least
as
an
expression
of
the
ideal
to
which
we
strive
of
the
practical
problems
of
course
are
very
difficult.
but
i
think
that
we
already
have
a
set
of
answers
in
the
decisions
which
have
been
worked
out
as
to
the
right
to
counsel.
the
right
to
counsel
for
an
indigent
does
not
include
the
right
to
go
to
wall
street
and
hire
the
most
expensive
lawyer
available
and
yet,
there
is
some
bare
minimum
which
it
does
require.
it
does
not
mean
that
someone
just
out
of
law
school
with
a
freshly
signed
license
who
does
an
incompetent
job
will
be
enough.
is
it
similar
beyond
there
and
i
know
of
no
rule
by
which
one
measures
it.
this
i
should
think
would
be
the
answer
with
regards
to
psychiatric
health.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
sure
it's
true.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well
that
the
rules
could
do
a
good
deal
toward
minimizing
the
disparity.
and
i
think
if
you
deny
the
lawyer
altogether
or
if
you
deny
a
psychiatrist
altogether,
the
disparity
is
too
great
to
be
constitutionally
tolerable.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
correct
and
had
referred
people
with
more
serious
emotional
problems
to
specialties.
we
had
a
doctor,
our
position
necessarily,
we
stand
or
fall
on
the
proposition
that
a
doctor
of
medicine
per
se
is
not
enough.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
agree,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
trial
on
the
merits
had
been
set
april
the
24th.
on
april
24th,
the
motion
was
made
for
a
preliminary
sanity
hearing
that
was
held
that
day.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that's
right.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that's
right.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
because
the
evidence
was
virtually
the
same
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
without
a
change
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
judgment
from
april
24th,
in
which
the
jury
found
him
to
be
sane
as
introduced
in
evidence
in
april
25th.
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
fact
in
its
decision
on
the
motion
for
rehearing
says
that
what
we
meant
to
say
is
that
since
the
issue
of
sanity
was
adjudicated
on
april
24th
they
need
not
be
tried
again
on
april
25th,
but
in
fact
the
judge
did
submit
to
the
jury
in
april
25th
go
into
this
opinion,
would
not
have
required
to
do
so
the
question
of
the
sanity
so
that
the
jury
on
the
merits
as
well
as
the
jury
at
the
lunacy
hearing
found
the
petitioner
to
be
sane
at
both
times
relevant.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
he
was
appointed
--
the
record
reflects
about
three
week
before
the
case
was
set
for
trial.
the
exact
date
was
not
on
the
record.
the
state
in
its
brief
suggests
that
april
2nd
was
the
date
--
april
24th
was
the
date
set
for
trial.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
mr.
justice
clark
nor
is
there
anything
to
show
that
there
was
any
examiner
available
who
would
come
to
make
the
examination
prior
to
that
time.
so
far
as
the
record
reflects
the
first
opportunity,
dr.
dial
had
was
during
the
recess
on
april
24.
the
record
also
shows
that
dr.
dial
had
never
met
mr.
moore
before
that
day.
and
i
think
the
--
a
fair
inference
can
be
drawn
from
the
record
as
to
the
difficulty
which
appointed
counsel
have
when
they
have
no
fee
to
offer
in
getting
a
professor
or
some
other
expert
to
come
to
another
place
and
make
this
kind
of
an
examination.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
not
so
far
as
the
record
reflects.
there
was,
of
course,
the
request
made
for
the
continuance
and
that
request
was
denied.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
get
to
the
matter
which
obviously
is
the
primary
interest
of
the
court,
there
is
one
small
detail;
mr.
justice
brennan,
under
the
texas
statues,
if
at
the
trial,
bush
had
been
found
to
have
been
insane
at
the
time
of
the
act,
he
would
have
been
a
free
man
at
the
end.
it
would
only
have
been
if
you
were
found
to
have
been
sane
at
the
time
of
the
act,
but
insane
at
the
time
of
the
trial
that
he
would
be
committed
as
i
understand
article
932
(b)
of
the
texas
code
of
criminal
procedure.
we
do
not
have
automatic
commitment.
we
had
a
notorious
case
within
the
last
few
weeks
of
a
boy
who
is
now
free
in
college
after
a
murder
because
the
jury
found
him
to
be
--
to
have
been
insane
at
the
time
of
the
killing,
but
the
sane
at
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
similar
commitment
proceedings
would
then
lie
but
there
is
no
automatic
defect,
mr.
justice
clark,
as
a
result
of
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--
jury's
verdict
to
provided
that'd
be
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
so,
it
would
--
that
entirely
depended
on
which
finding
the
jury
made
out
of
the
possible
findings
it
could
have
made
on
the
psychiatric
testimony.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
if
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
act,
the
statutory
scheme
is
he
is
not
guilty
of
the
crime
therefore
the
further
finding
becomes
surplusage.
it
is
only
if
he
is
sane
at
the
time
of
the
act
unless
guilty,
but
insane
at
the
time
of
the
trial
that
there
is
automatic
commitment.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
young
boy
was
found
--
to
have
been
insane
at
the
time
he
killed
the
girl
but
sane
at
the
time
of
trial,
and
so
he
is
now
free
and
back
in
college,
playing
football,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
[inaudible]
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
if
he
is
insane
at
both
times,
mr.
justice
clark,
again
he
goes
free.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
so
that
if
dr.
hug
who
testified
at
the
trial
and
if
the
jury
had
believed
that
bush
was
insane
at
all
relevant
times,
bush
would
have
gone
out
of
the
courtroom
a
free
man.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
civil
commitment
proceeding
then
might
lie
but
there
would
have
to
be
brought
independently
under
the
constitution,
a
competent
medical
or
psychiatric
testimony
would
have
been
required.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
not
so
long
as
the
jury
finds
that
he
was
not
guilty
of
the
crime
by
reason
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
there
is
very
elaborate
statutory
provisions
to
the
effect
to
which
i
think
i
have
just
described.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no
statute
committing
him
for
this
crime.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it's
quite
apparent
from
the
oral
argument
the
court
is
primarily
interested
in
the
question
of
the
effect
of
the
document
which
the
state
has
filed
very
recently.
this
is
a
very
troublesome
question
for
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
troublesome
because
i
cannot
answer
the
court's
questions
with
the
assurance
i
should
like
to
have
when
i
appear
before
the
court.
they're
not
fairly
brief
on
the
matter
and
as
i
indicated
in
my
initial
argument,
if
the
court
is
interested
in
the
question,
we
would
be
extremely
pleased
to
file
a
supplementary
brief
addressing
ourselves
specifically
to
the
question.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
agree
entirely,
mr.
justice
white
that
it
seems
to
me
this
is
the
--
a
question
of
threshold
importance.
a
question
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
hope
not
to
neglect
that
and
i
do
want
to
speak
a
little
bit
more
about
the
procedural
consequences
of
the
affidavit
which
the
state
filed.
counsel
suggested
that
this
document
was
filed
because
of
--
the
state
thought
it
had
no
legal
significance.
they
assumed
the
petitioner
would
think
it
had
legal
significance.
in
fact,
petitioner
and
the
state
or
has
one
on
this,
but
i
recognized
that
the
court's
duty
is
not
to
decide
the
case
if
the
case
is
not
properly
here
because
of
this.
we
have
had
available
to
us
since
--
or
for
15
days
we've
known
of
this
document
and
in
for
eight
days,
we
had
a
copy
of
it.
we
refrained
from
filing
with
the
court
because
on
such
brief
study
as
we
made,
it
seemed
to
us
not
legally
relevant.
we
did
not
know
about
the
commitment
until
sunday.
it
seems
not
legally
relevant
to
us
because
so
far
as
we
can
ascertain
both
by
library
research
and
by
consulting
those
learned
in
texas
criminal
procedure,
the
attorney
--
the
assistant
attorney
general
and
the
county
attorney
are
absolutely
correct
when
they
say
there
is
no
judicial
remedy
in
texas
under
the
state
of
facts,
that
the
only
remedy
would
be
an
application
to
the
board
of
pardons
and
paroles,
an
executive
clemency
from
the
governor.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
very
odd
state
of
procedure
for
a
state
to
have
but
on
my
present
information,
i
cannot
disagree
with
the
attorneys
for
the
state
who
have
represented
to
the
court
that
there
is
nothing,
as
a
matter
of
texas
procedure
which
a
texas
court
could
do
if
you
were
to
remand
the
case
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
they
vacate
the
judgment
and
then
say
now,
“please
take
further
action
in
the
light
of
this
new
information.”
it
is
my
belief,
so
far
as
i'm
advised,
that
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
say
there
is
nothing
we
can
do,
this
is
final
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
in
which
case,
i
expect
that
next
term
would
find
us
back
up
here.
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested
during
argument
for
the
state
that
even
if
there
is
no
procedure
as
a
matter
of
texas
law
that
that
is
not
really
the
question
here.
the
question
is
what
can
be
done
as
a
matter
of
the
powers
and
the
procedures
of
this
court.
i'm
not
entirely
sure,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
i
would
agree
with
that
formulation
of
the
position
if
this
were
a
federal
case.
undoubtedly,
this
court
in
its
supervisory
power
of
lower
federal
courts
could
do
what
it
wants.
i
am
--
i'm
not
certain
that
the
court
has
the
power
to
vacate
a
conviction
coming
here
from
the
state
in
the
absence
of
or
in
the
absence
of
any
demonstrative
state
procedure
for
responding
to
the
new
situation.
i
do
not
know
that
the
court
has
in
its
power
to
invent
a
new
criminal
procedure
for
texas
much
as
texas
may
need
one.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
of
course
and
no
doubt
of
that,
mr.
justice
white,
but
mr.
justice
stewart's
suggested
as
i
understood
it,
your
honor,
was
that
even
if
there
is
nothing
the
state
can
do
about
it
as
a
matter
of
state
procedure
that
this
court
by
its
own
mandate
might
require
a
new
trial
in
the
state
court
and
as
this
as
to
which
i
have
some
question
and
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
justice
clark,
if
i
understand
texas
law
correctly
the
answer
is
no.
the
answer
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
to
whatever
document
mr.
moore
and
i
might
present
would
be
that
there
is
no
error
in
what
happened
at
the
trial
court
in
april
of
1961
and
we
cannot
do
anything
in
the
light
of
this
new
information
except
perhaps
suspend
the
proceedings
under
article
932
(b)
until
the
petitioner
becomes
sane.
this
would
not
involve
a
retrial
on
the
merits.
it
would
simply
be
--
if
we
won't
enter
a
final
judgment
of
conviction
until
he
is
finally
--
be
sane.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
understood
the
county
attorney
said
that
also
but
i
understood
the
assistant
attorney
general
to
say
there
isn't
--
no
judicial
remedy
in
this
state
of
the
case.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
section
932
(b)
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure,
mr.
justice
white,
is
the
section
which
deals
with
insanity
after
conviction.
and
i
would
think
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
might
well
say
this
is
a
compendious
statute,
many
sections.
and
this
is
the
exclusive
procedure
and
the
statute
nowhere
provides
for
a
remand
and
a
new
trial
in
the
light
of
such
newly
discovered
evidence.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
would
suspend
the
affirmance
of
conviction
under
the
statute.
he
would
be
in
a
mental
hospital
at
rusk,
i
take
it,
and
he
would
be
considered
under
the
statutory
language
as
a
person
charged
with
a
crime.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
it
is
quite
probable,
given
his
age
in
the
long
history
that
there
is
no
successful
treatment,
but
there
is
surely
a
difference
i
suggest,
mr.
justice
brennan,
between
being
in
a
mental
hospital
as
a
result
to
civil
commitment
which
is
where
i
think
petitioner
perhaps
should
be
and
being
in
a
mental
hospital
as
person
charged
of
a
crime
--
convicted
of
a
crime
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
conviction
would
stand
in
abeyance.
it
would
not
have
been
affirmed
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
it
would
not
have
been
reversed.
actually,
the
statute
has
a
further
provision
that
even
if
you
have
a
suspension
of
the
proceeding
that
the
defendant's
counsel
may
then
move
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
go
ahead
and
decide
the
case,
of
a
man
who's
in
a
mental
hospital,
so
that
we
could
then
press
for
a
decision
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
come
back
here
still
without
any
decision
by
a
jury
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
sane
at
the
time
these
things
were
taken
from
mr.
hackler.
i
wanted
to
make
one
further
point
with
regard
to
mr.
justice
stewart‘s
suggestion,
that
this
court
might
--
by
its
own
authority,
order
a
new
trial.
even
if
that
could
be
done
and
the
fact
that
the
problems
of
federalism
which
i
see
are
not
overwhelming,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
result
is
not
really
a
fortunate
one
but
what
would
happen
would
be
that
because
we
have
an
affidavit
of
an
examination
made
two
weeks
before
the
case
comes
on
before
this
court
then
this
particular
defendant
would
get
a
new
trial
with
psychiatric
testimony.
and
the
result
then
in
texas,
i
guess,
would
be
that
the
only
defendant
who
gets
psychiatric
assistance
at
the
trial
is
one
who
has
managed
to
have
a
petition
for
certiorari
granted.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
my
interest
is
representing
the
petitioner,
not
deciding
a
constitutional
question.
this
incidentally
is
the
reason
why
there
is
no
amicus
brief
question
to
which
you
referred.
the
court
granted
the
american
civil
liberties
union
permission
to
file
an
amicus
brief
over
the
objections
of
petitioner.
we
objected
to
the
filing
even
though
the
american
civil
liberties
union
would
be
on
our
side
because
we
believe
their
conception
of
the
case
would
be
different
than
ours
that
we
were
interested
in
representing
this
particular
petitioner
and
arguing
to
this
court
that
this
man
on
the
state
of
facts
has
been
denied
due
process.
the
court
granted
the
motion
four
days
later.
the
counsel
for
the
civil
liberties
union
advised
the
court
that
they
have
then
seen
petitioner's
brief
in
light
of
that
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
delay
would
be
caused
if
they
prepared
an
amicus
brief,
they
were
withdrawing
the
request.
i
was
interested
in
mr.
crow's
reference
to
smith
v.
baldie
as
bearing
on
what
should
be
done
with
this
new
last
minute
development.
it
has
a
bearing,
of
course.
as
he
pointed
out
to
you
in
the
smith
case
after
it
had
been
decided
in
the
court
of
appeals.
information
appeared
that
dr.
drayton,
the
psychiatrist
who
had
testified
that
smith
was
sane
had
himself
been
adjudicated
insane
and
that
the
insanity
was
of
a
sort
which
was
progressive
from
which
you
might
reasonably
have
been
inferred
that
dr.
drayton
had
been
insane
at
the
time
he
said
smith
was
sane.
now
on
that
showing,
three
members
of
this
court
thought
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to,
i
take
it,
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
for
a
new
trial
of
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
a
majority
of
this
court,
six
judges,
held
the
contrary.
now
i
think,
mr.
justice
goldberg
suggested
that
there
was
a
distinction
between
these
two
and
that
here
it
is
the
sanity
of
the
defendant
by
which
we
have
no
information
while
in
smith,
it
was
the
sanity
of
the
psychiatrist.
of
course,
there
is
a
distinction,
if
i
may
suggest
sir,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
distinction,
it
cuts
exactly
the
other
way
that
there
is
more
reason
for
a
remand
where
the
newly
discovered
evidence
goes
not
to
the
facts
which
were
tried
by
a
jury
and
decided
in
the
case
but
they
go
instead
to
the
integrity
of
the
process.
if
for
example,
we
had
information
that
a
trial
judge
had
been
insane
at
the
time
he
conducted
a
trial,
i
would
think
this
would
be
the
strongest
kind
of
case
for
saying
it
must
go
back.
but
here,
we
are
asked
to
take
the
case
back
to
decide
the
facts
which
the
jury
has
once
decided.
we
now
have
more
information
on
which
to
decide
them,
but
it
is
simply
a
question
of
the
quantum
of
evidence
rather
than
something
which
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
process
itself
and
so
i
regard
baldie
isn't
authoritative.
this
is
the
case
properly
here
for
decision
by
this
court.
the
chief
justice
very
kindly
suggested
that
i
not
neglect
to
discuss
the
merits
because
of
this
other
very
interesting
procedural
question
and
i
would
like
to
say
just
a
few
words
on
that
before
i
close
if
no
further
questions
on
the
procedural
question.
there
has
been
some
discussion
of
dr.
dial
why
there
was
not
more
time
given
for
his
examination,
why
we
did
not
have
him
stay
over
in
the
afternoon,
why
he
hadn't
been
brought
down
days
before
when
the
jury
presumably
was
not
confined
on
a
hot
room.
i
think
that
in
part,
this
is
a
question
of
time.
the
motion
for
appointment
of
the
psychiatrist
or
for
commitment
to
a
mental
institution
was
made
and
denied
on
friday,
april
21st.
the
case
came
on,
on
monday
april
24th.
it
was
not
until
friday
that
counsel
knew
that
he
was
not
going
to
get
them
to
court
that
to
which
he
thought
himself
entitled
and
counsel
then
spent
the
weekend
hunting
for
someone,
anyone
who
would
be
upheld.
dr.
dial
was
found,
did
agree
to
come
but
the
question
is
not
that
of
time
so
much
as
it
is
that
of
money.
if
we
had
been
paying
dr.
dial
of
fee,
then
we
could
have
said
to
dr.
dial
then,
“please,
stay
over
tonight
after
the
court
adjourns.
you
can
make
a
complete
examination.”
but
dr.
dial
was
there
as
a
matter
of
grace
and
mr.
moore
was
entirely
subject
to
what
dr.
dial
wanted
to
do
and
was
in
no
position
to
tell
dr.
dial
what
to
do.
if
the
motions
had
been
granted,
if
the
state
had
appointed
a
psychiatrist,
the
court
had
pointed
the
psychiatrist,
of
course
we
would
not
have
had
that
problem.
there
has
been
something
said
also
about
the
competence
of
dr.
compton.
i
surely
would
not
want
to
be
understood
as
suggesting
that
dr.
compton
is
not
a
competent
physician.
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
it.
the
thrust
of
our
argument
is
not
that
at
all,
he
is
only
that
good
as
he
maybe
for
many
other
ailments.
he
is
not
qualified
to
diagnose
subtle,
mental
illness.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
north
dakota,
mr.
justice
stewart
by
statute
they
require
the
appointment
of
a
psychiatrist
for
the
commitment,
i've
forgotten
which
to
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
a
mental
hospital.
i
dare
say
that
there
are
psychiatrists
in
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--
the
states.
the
public
institution
is
the
usual
place.
under
the
north
dakota
statute
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
the
court
either
can
appoint
two
(inaudible)
qualified
experts
or
it
can
commit
the
defendant
to
the
state
hospital
for
the
insane
for
observation
or
examination
regarding
his
present
mental
condition.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
is.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
is
conceivable
that
they
would,
but
their
statutory
provision
also
authorizes
them
to
commit
the
man
to
the
mental
hospital
for
the
insane
where
i
think
they
may
fairly
assume
there
are
qualified
psychiatrists.
i've
observed
that
the
state
of
mississippi
which
is
not
one
of
the
wealthier
states
in
the
union
in
1960
adopted
the
statute
requiring
some
relief
of
this
kind.
and
i
would
suggest
that
what
the
state
of
mississippi
can
afford
and
what
north
dakota
can
furnish,
texas
can
furnish.
this
does
not
seem
to
me
an
insuperable
burden.
the
county
attorney
made
it
clear
that
if
dr.
compton
had
told
him
that
in
his
view
petitioner
was
insane
or
there
was
a
serious
doubt
about
it
that
he
could
have
done
something
about
it.
he
could
have
taken
bush
to
dallas
or
brought
a
psychiatrist
down
from
dallas.
we
know
where
to
find
them
in
texas
if
the
need
arises
and
if
the
constitution
requires
it.
i
think
i
should
in
closing
say
something
in
what
has
seemed
to
me
the
hardest
question
in
the
case
or
at
least
the
hardest
under
the
supplemental
brief
was
filed
and
when
we
try
rather
imagine
that
the
court
would
put
to
me
and
that
is,
is
there
a
limit
to
the
doctrine
which
i
am
answering
--
asking
the
court
to
adopt.
if
the
court
were
to
say
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
constitutional
duty
to
provide
the
psychiatrist,
would
the
court
also
have
to
say
that
there‘s
a
constitutional
duty
on
the
state
to
provide
ballistic
experts,
accountants
and
writing
experts,
all
those
kinds
of
people.
to
that,
my
answer
is
two-fold.
first,
one
can
hope
that
or
at
least
reasonably
read
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
as
saying,
that
the
state
is
required
to
make
available
to
those
who
were
tried
with
the
crime
and
who
are
poor,
whatever
kinds
of
expert
assistance
the
state
is
able
to
afford
for
itself
with
the
uneven
struggle
is
not
constitutional
but
i
do
not
have
to
take
that
position
in
this
case.
i
don't
believe
because
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
clear
distinction
between
psychiatric
testimony
and
testimony
of
the
kinds
which
i
have
mentioned.
the
distinction
in
several
ways;
there
is
a
distinction
in
the
importance
of
this
testimony
where
insanity
is
pleaded.
this
is
usually
the
crucial
issue
in
the
case
is
other
matters
frequently
are
not
so
important.
the
other
distinction,
the
one
which
is
to
me
the
more
compelling;
i
believe
that
counsel
can
get
along
not
equally,
perhaps
not
desirably,
but
counsel
can
see
that
the
jury
learned
something
if
the
state
has
called
a
ballistics'
expert
or
an
accounting
or
an
accountant
or
a
handwriting
expert
because
of
these
other
kinds
of
matters
it
isn't
simply
a
question
of
late
testimony
on
each
side.
the
state
will
have
produced
an
expert
and
an
able
and
devoted
counsel
can
make
himself
expert
enough
perhaps
to
conduct
intelligible
cross
examination
and
to
see
that
the
jury
understands
what
the
facts
are.
but
here,
there
is
never
a
person
put
on
even
who
can
be
crossed
examined
who
has
the
qualifications
to
be
able
to
answer
the
questions,
counsel
would
like
to
put.
this
is
an
all
or
nothing
proposition
and
we
had
nothing.
and
for
that
reason,
those
that
i
have
mentioned
we
pray
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
would
fully
satisfy
the
argument
we
are
making
here,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
is
not
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
fact
that
the
psychiatrist
is
state
paid,
i
suggest
is
as
immaterial
as
the
fact
that
mr.
moore,
the
court
appointed
counsel
was
paid
by
state.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
pardon?
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
it
is
not
who
pays
the
psychiatrist
which
seems
to
me
important,
it
is
that
the
psychiatrist
be
competent
and
impartial.
if
he
as
though
as
the
fact
that
he
is
a
full
time
employee
of
the
state,
would
i
think
that
it
would
be
immaterial?
his
testimony
would
satisfy
all
that
we
ask.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
he
does.
but
what
is
the
system
in
massachusetts
and
those
other
states
the
psychiatrist
make
the
report.
the
report
is
freely
available
to
both
sides
prior
to
trial.
counsel
can
study
and
see
what
a
competent
psychiatrist
had
said.
if
it's
worthwhile,
he
can
go
out
to
talk
with
the
psychiatrist
and
he
can
call
him
as
witness
if
he
wants
to.
it's
there.
he
isn't
left
to
grope
in
the
dark
and
to
go
beg
for
a
professor
of
psychology.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
state
has
said
that
we
don't
know
such
a
thing
as
the
psychiatrist
in
texas
that
it's
not
defined.
it
is
a
term,
of
course,
which
is
used
in
our
statutes
a
fair
number
of
times.
this
thing,
a
term
of
art
fairly
well
understood.
i
would
want
a
person
who
is
competent
by
the
standard
which
the
medical
profession
sets
and
licensing
a
person
to
hold
himself
out
as
a
psychiatrist
whether
or
not
a
psychologist,
a
clinical
psychologist
is
sufficient,
is
a
question
which
had
divided
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
jenkins
case
and
i
would
rather
not
have
to
argue
that
case
as
well
as
my
own.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
versions
of
view
in
the
medical
profession
and
the
psychiatric
profession
as
to
whether
they
should
say
this,
they
chafe
of
course,
under
m'naghten's
rules
and
say
that
it
asked
the
wrong
question.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
expect
that
--
i
expect
that
they
do
but
there
is
a
remarkably
uniform
consensus
of
psychiatric
writers
and
of
professional
groups.
the
american
psychiatric
association,
the
group
for
the
management
of
psychiatric,
other
similar
groups
but
the
appointment
of
a
psychiatrist
is
indispensable
in
a
case
where
sanity
is
seriously
an
issue
as
i
submit
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well
the
state
didn't
need
a
psychiatrist
and
we
had
nothing,
but
i
suggest
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
if
we
have
had
a
psychiatrist,
mr.
allen
would
have
found
one.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
of
course,
i
would
have
a
much
easier
case
if
the
state
had
had
several
psychiatrists,
but
i
suggest
that
this
is,
if
i
may
with
respect
sir,
that
this
does
not
seem
to
me
a
material
distinction.
the
state
had
the
ability
to
produce
psychiatrists
if
it
felt
that
they
were
necessary.
we
did
not.
mr.
allen,
as
an
able
lawyer
decided
that
it
was
not
necessary
since
we
weren't
going
to
have
a
psychiatrist,
but
in
the
small
town
of
waxahachie,
the
testimony
of
the
county
health
officer,
well-known
there
within
his
judgment
be
sufficient
to
carry
his
burden
of
proof
and
he
was
right,
but
i
am
sure
that
he
would
have
had
a
psychiatrist
if
he
had
felt
he
had
needed
it.
the
state
had
the
potential.
the
defendant
unless
the
court
comes
to
his
aid
had
no
potential.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
we
can‘t
know
that,
it
didn't
happen.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
in
these
cases,
one
of
them
is
a
square
holding
that
the
government
is
required
to
pay
for
the
retention
by
the
defendant
handwriting
expert,
the
other
one
is
a
dictum
to
this
effect
that
if
the
defendant
had
asked
for
funds
for
a
handwriting
expert,
the
court
would
have
provided
it
for
him.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
not
clear
on
that
mr.
justice
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
it
was
such
of
an
issue
which
has
a
big
importance.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
but
it's
exactly
my
position.
i
feel
in
judge
frank's
phrase
that
the
lawyer
in
this
position
was
like
a
surgeon
without
a
scalpel.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
believe
it
would
justice
harlan,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
don‘t
think
that
the
state
can
open
the
issue
of
sanity
and
then
by
some
entirely
arbitrary
and
irrational
restriction
close
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
because
i
submit
sir
that
the
state
could
not
rationally
say
that
the
jury
system
works
best
where
the
jury
is
uninformed.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
it
is
somewhat
longer
that
in
this
book
in
1838,
isaac
gray
says
that
in
cases
where
insanity
is
pleaded
and
it
is
a
serious
issue,
psychiatrists
are
always
called.
so
i
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
pardon?
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
this
is
in
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
obviously,
[inaudible]
some
experience
in
new
england.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
of
course.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes
sir,
yes.
