number
511,
james
e.
bush,
petitioner,
versus
bruce
allen
--
versus
texas
rather.
you
may
proceed,
mr.
wright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
allen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mind
addressing
yourself
first
to
the
question
of
that
latest
brief
of
yours?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
have
any
legal
effect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
answer
to
that
after
lunch,
we'll
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
allen,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
trial
court
didn't
treat
him
that
way,
did
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
mean
didn't
he
referred
to
him
as
supposed
expert
or
some
other
soaring
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
understood
he
was.
i
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
crow.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
statute
reads
that
way,
doesn't
it?
i
thought
they
read
the
statute,
it
said
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
no
longer
beneficial
to
him,
why,
he'd
be
returned
to
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
penitentiary
to
serve
the
remainder
of
his
term.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
statute
does
say,
if
medical
science
won't
help
him
and
contribute
to
his
cure,
then
he
goes
back
to
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
penitentiary,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what's
the
purpose
of
filing
up
your
pleas?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
has
no
legal
effect
--
what
is
the
purpose
of
filing
up
here,
two
days
before
our
hearing
of
the
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
alright
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
quarreling
about
the
lack
of
time
we've
had
but
why
did
you
file
it
here
if
it
had
no
legal
significance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
grant
him
a
new
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
believe
that
would
be
the
position
of
your
office.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
didn't
take
the
gates,
did
he?
[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
said
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
rush
it
up,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
much
time
did
they
give?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
--
you
may
file
a
--
you
may
file
a
brief
on
that
if
you
wish,
mr.
wright
but
i
would
want
to
foreclose
you
on
the
merits
of
your
case
irrespective
of
this
affidavit,
so
i
hope
you
won't
neglect
that
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
mr.
wright.
thank
you.
