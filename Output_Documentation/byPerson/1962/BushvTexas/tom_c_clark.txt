mr.
wright,
what
was
the
procedure
utilized
in
the
bush
case
in
313
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
am
i
right
that
there
was
a
finding
that
he
was
insane
in
this
particular
case?
is
that
(voice

--
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
you
might
have
a
complication,
might
you
not,
because
i
suppose
that
the
question
here
would
be
whether
he
had
the
process
and
that
he's
only
given
the
20
minutes
or
whatever
it
was
to
have
a
psychiatrist
and
the
state
didn't
provide
a
psychiatrist
as
i
understood
it
rather
than
they
often
did
in
the
county
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
doctors,
whatever
you
call
it.
so,
you'd
--
you
would
have
some
complications,
would
you
not,
in
proceeding
in
a
new
case.
did
the
court
of
appeals

it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
thank
you.
justice
tom
c.
clark

to
show
that
he
--
that
bush

available
before
april
21st
for
an
examination
by
anybody
that

justice
tom
c.
clark

there
been
a
continuance
before?
justice

justice

long?
justice
tom
c.
clark
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
do
i
understand
that
first
your
conviction
to
you
as
a
matter
of
criminal
charge
fall
[inaudible]
some
other
place
in
the
united
states
besides
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
suppose
you
--
the
county
officer
suddenly
[inaudible].
would
you
still
have
[inaudible]?
justice
tom
c.
clark
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
you
--
and
he
had
an
entire
experience
as
to
bush?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
don't
even
pretend
you've
found
anything
[inaudible]?
justice
tom
c.
clark
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
[inaudible],
no,
tried
in
april.
justice
tom
c.
clark
in
april,
1961.
justice
tom
c.
clark
mr.
crow,
may
i
inquire
over
this,
in
your
statement,
the
attorney
general,
[inaudible]
criminal
appeals
and
it
comes
to
the
attention
of
the
state.
you
have
it,
favorable
to
the
accused
pertinent
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
[inaudible]
or
guilty
of
the
crime.
what
is
the
[inaudible]
attorney
general
if
he
knew
something
here?
so,
what
does
he
do
with
reference
to
that?
why
would
he
appeal
this
favor
if
the
court
has
jurisdiction,
an
appellate
court
is
reviewing
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
discovered
evidence,
state
has
it,
and
it
bears
directly
on
the
question
of
innocence
or
guilt
which
would
properly
had
been
admissible
on
the
trial
before
the
jury.
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
to
be
the
state's
[inaudible]
before
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
there?
i
know
you
have
a
state
attorney
but
what
was
--
been
given
[inaudible]?
justice
tom
c.
clark
maybe
[inaudible]
to
get
any
conviction?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
case
is
here
on
the
merits,
isn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i'll
--
just
thinking
if
the
--
what
the
county
attorney
says
at
the
time
depend
it
--
depends
on
the
time
that's
elapsed.
if
we
were
to
vacate
the
judgment
and
that
is
where
[inaudible]
all
the
time
and
--
so
then
you
could
come
in,
or
mr.
wright,
might
come
in
then
with
some
sort
of
an
appropriate
motion,
could
he
not
before
the
court
of
criminal
appeals?
justice
tom
c.
clark
when
we
vacated
the
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
said,
if
we
vacate
it,
then
its
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
it's
all
over.
then
mr.
wright
came
in,
he
say,
“let's
--
here's
the
base
--
psychiatrist
says,
if
--
this
is
true.”
and
then
you
came
in
and
said,
“well,
looks
like
this
man
has
to
have
a
hearing
on
this”,
then
you'd
be
at
a
hearing,
wouldn't
you?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
apparently
he's
not
dangerous.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
maybe
he's
the
guard
now
of
the
hospital.
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
could
file
--
observe
an
insanity
proceeding?
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes.
justice
tom
c.
clark
he
wouldn't
be
sent
to
a
hospital
by
reason
of
the
verdict?
justice
tom
c.
clark
he
would
not
be.
justice
tom
c.
clark
here
though
he
wouldn't
have
that,
would
you,
assuming
that
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
assuming
that
this
certificate
is
right,
which
maybe
a
valid
assumption
that
he
would
be
insane
if
he
both
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
understand.
justice
tom
c.
clark
there's
no
statute
upon
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
as
i
understand
it,
no
statute
committing
him
though.
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
you'd
have
to
file
several
proceedings
then
have
a
jury
and
if
the
jury
found
him
insane
and
he's
committed.
justice
tom
c.
clark
do
you
found
him
insane
as
if
the
jury
in
the
case
you
gave,
well
then
he
would
be
not
committed.
justice
tom
c.
clark
why
didn't
the
state
have
the
power?
i
don't
understand,
it's
here
on
the
merits.
we
vacate
the
judgment
that's
been
entered
by
your
highest
court,
it
lies
there
just
as
it
did
when
it
first
came
from
the
ellis
county
court,
wouldn't
that
be
true,
not
in
a
file
of
judgment?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well
then,
we'll
assume
this
may
not
be
correct,
perhaps
you
feel
that
your
[inaudible]
would
mean
too
different,
we'll
assume
that
you
file
something
with
the
court
that
called
their
attention
what
is
here,
or
that
that
was
called
to
their
attention
through
some
source.
would
not
that
court
have
the
power
to
consider
that
and
to
decide
that
there
should
be
some
sort
of
a
hearing
on
that
particular
phase
of
this
problem?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i
understood
the
county
attorney
to
say
that
very
often
the
state's
attorney
did
call
such
things
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals'
attention
and
that
sometimes
he
would
recommend
himself
that
there'd
be
a
remand.
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
handwriting's
case
as
you
had
referred
to
in
your
brief
at
page
40,
that
case
is
where
the
