justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
it
be
in
your
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
charged
or
proven
that
they
went
there,
that
they
were
urged
to
go
there
and
stay
after
the
owner
and
knowingly
advised
them
to
leave
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
was
there
any
evidence
to
that
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
this
one
you're
arguing,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
it
have
been
a
violation
of
this
ordinance
not
the
one
that
conceded
to
be
invalid,
but
the
one
which
is
the
basis
of
the
other
prosecution,
would
there
have
been
any
violation
of
that
ordinance
to
go
in
there
and
stay
before
they
were
invited,
told
to
get
out
by
the
owner?
would
they
have
violated
any
law
by
going
in
there
and
staying
until
the
owner
told
them
to
get
out?
would
they
have
violated
this
city
ordinance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
gober,
i'm
talking
about
this
one.
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
case
show
that
shuttlesworth
and
this
other
man
urged
them
to
go
into
the
store
and
stay
there
even
though
the
owner
ordered
them
to
get
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
suppose
we
could
take
judicial
knowledge
of
this
issue
–
that
they
got
to
stay
there
or
they
order
them
out
if
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
that's
a
valid
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
you
say
that
taking
all
their
evidence
as
proof,
they
did
not
prove
any
evidence
from
which
it
could
be
found
that
he
urged
them
to
go
and
then
break
this
law
by
staying
after
they
were
ordered
to
leave?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
no
jury,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
opinion
of
any
kind,
was
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
what's
i'm
asking,
the
trial
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
done
precisely
what's
the
court
of
appeals
said,
gone
there
and
sat
it
down
for
an
indefinite
time
and
nothing
had
happened,
would
they
have
violated
your
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
--
i
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
i'm
saying
--
asking
is
that
whether
this
is
crime
or
a
quasi
crime,
it
has
to
be
proved
in
the
court,
but
the
charge
is
that
they
incited
them
to
violate
this
section.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
would
agree
that
that
meant
that
they
violated
nothing
unless
they
were
ordered
to
get
out
and
refused
to
go
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they'd
have
to
incite
them
to
violate
the
whole
thing
which
was
to
go
in,
not
merely
to
go
in
but
stay
there
after
they
were
invited
to
leave.
now,
i
have
grave
doubts
myself
in
finding
in
the
evidence
that
was
given
anything
on
which
as
mr.
justice
harlan
said,
of
course
they
could
draw
an
inference.
it
was
to
incite
to
violation
of
the
law,
that
would
be
one
thing,
but
i
find
it
difficult
to
say
because
they
had
merely
invited
them
to
go
there
and
stay
even
for
a
long
time.
that
that's
enough,
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
which
i
think
a
criminal
or
quasi-criminal
activity
have
to
be
established
to
convict
them
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
--
would
the
burden
of
proof
that
he
--
you
have
to
prove
a
crime
by
evidence
if
--
you
can't
just
guess.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
of
course,
that
here,
they
said
go
there.
well,
i
can
well
imagine
that
much
could
be
accomplished
in
a
way,
they
[inaudible]
merely
by
going
there
and
staying
and
then
leaving.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
did.
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
must
say
that
i
understood
that
to
mean,
i
had
little
to
do
with
it,
i
understood
that
means
that
they
must
have
some
evidence
from
which
it
can
be
inferred,
the
man
is
guilty
of
each
essential
element
of
the
crime.
here,
an
essential
element
of
the
crime
is
to
stay
there
as
it
conceded
after
they
warned
to
leave.
he
didn't
tell
them
to
do
that.
i
would
find
it
difficult
myself
to
draw
an
inference
from
this
evidence
but
that's
what
he
told
them
to
do,
that's
a
basic
conviction
of
a
crime
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
talking
at
his
home.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
fact
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
fact
that
they
--
the
fact
that
they
went
there
and
assuming
if
they
went
there
and
went
further
than
they
had
--
language
to
do
and
were
guilty
of
violating
it.
you
can't
take
that
back,
that
is
to
show
that
when
he
told
them
this,
he'd
included
something
that
you
wouldn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
without
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
don't
concede
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
--
may
i
see
mr.
davis
in
that
connection
that
i
know
--
i'm
not
an
expert
on
it
but
i
would
think
there
are
some
sit-ins
where
they
sit
there
until
they're
directed
out
and
then
they
get
out
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
say
this
--
they
might
have
been
when
they
got
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
merely
telling
a
man
to
go
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
there
was
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
an
ordinance
there,
though
where
they
could
be
put
in
jail
whether
they
violated
it
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
limited
to
the
precise
evidence
that's
in
the
record
in
a
criminal
case
on
the
question
of
sufficiency.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
you
would
too
of
course.
i
say
--
what
i
mean
is
that
i
agree
with
you
that
we
should
limit
consideration
of
whether
there's
enough
evidence
here
to
the
actual
evidence
as
given
in
the
case.
