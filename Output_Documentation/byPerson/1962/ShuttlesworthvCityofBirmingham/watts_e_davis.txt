mr.
watts
e.
davis
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
one
of
your
justices
just
asked
the
question
of
whether
or
not
without
the
use
of
the
word
“incite,”
the
petitioners
would
have
still
been
involved
under
the
aiding
and
abetting
language
and
i
have
cited
in
my
brief,
the
case
of
davis
versus
state,
36
alabama,
well
of
course
its
cited,
which
--
and
this
is
on
page
11
if
you
have
my
brief.
the
words,
aid
and
abet
comprehend
all
the
systems
rendered
by
actual
words
of
encouragement
or
support
and
then
went
on
to
say,
nor
is
it
necessary
to
show
prearrangement
to
do
the
specific
wrong
complained
of
and
i
also
cite
the
case
[inaudible]
versus
state
stating
aiding
and
abetting
and
comprehend
all
the
assistance
rendered
by
acts
or
words
of
encouragement.
and
then
also,
the
participation
in
a
crime
in
the
community
of
purposes
--
that
perpetrators
need
not
be
proved
by
direct
or
positive
testimony
but
may
be
inferred
from
circumstantial
evidence
and
that's
parsons
versus
state
all
of
which
are
set
out
on
page
12
of
respondent's
brief.
but
actually,
i
don't
think
there's
any
special
significance
in
the
use
of
the
word
“incite”
except
it
might
clarify
to
some
extent,
but
the
state
courts
in
construing
its
own
statute
have
said
that
the
actual
word
of
encouragement
are
sufficient
under
aiding
and
abetting
alone
without
even
referring
to
the
use
of
the
language
incite
was
[inaudible]
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
think
i
can
explain
that
to
his
honor
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
think
i
can
explain
that.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
there
--
that
brief
which
you
don't
have
and
i
have
read
what
the
great
--
let's
say,
well
they
never
proved
that
these
students
went
out
anywhere
and
committed
any
crime.
now,
how
can
you
aid
and
abet
somebody
when
you
haven't
established
they
committed
a
crime?
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
that
they
were
overlooking
and
used
the
word
incite
and
--
because
they
used
the
word
incite
is
convenient
in
this
case
because
--
and
you
don't
need
the
court
decisions
to
read
the
--
that
end,
that
word
encouragement,
are
aiding
and
abetting.
so
our
ordinance
simply
spells
out
that
inciting
is
one
of
the
alternate
modes
of
offending
the
ordinance.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
oh,
yes
sir.
yes
sir.
incite
actually
is
nothing
in
our
opinion
but
they
had
gone
on
this
level
that
they
have
to
aid
and
abet
somebody
to
do
a
crime.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
and
they'd
made
it
more
of
convenient
well
on
offense.
and
it
made
it
more
convenient
to
say
well,
let's
use
the
word
incite,
that's
a
clear
word
and
you'll
overlook
it
and
i
pointed
out
that
they
were
overlooking
the
inciting
part.
because
i
think
incite
give
the
flavor
of
the
thing.
at
least
it
warrants
you
that
you
don't
have
to
have
a
combination
of
this
thing
result
in
some
actual
offense
later
on.
if
i
get
out
here
and
hold
a
meeting
and
i
said,
i
don't
want
you
people,
get
out
here
and
i
want
you
to
go
about
this
plan
of
robbery
or
intimidation
and
incite
the
other.
and
i
may
do
my
best
to
influence
them,
but
my
powers
in
persuasion
are
not
always
very
successful
and
they
may
change
their
mind,
but
the
point
is
i
--
i
am
inciting
and
the
court
in
its
decision
under
the
state
statute
said
that
i'm
also
aiding
and
abetting,
but
they
tried
to
go
on
the
theory
that
to
aid
and
abet
should
had
to
have
the
actual
commission
of
the
crime.
as
i
pointed
out
in
brief,
many
cases
called
it
even
the
common
law,
that's
what
in
the
facts
and
our
position
is
simply
that
we
have
codified
one
in
effect
was
common
law.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
i
say
this
that
the
appellate
court
in
alabama
said
that
they
sit
down,
they
used
the
word
sit
down
as
contrast
to
sit-in.
it
was
comparable
to
sit
down
strikes
and
that
evidently
the
connotation
that
we
used
here,
you
see
these
things
were
discussed
in
a
meeting,
they
would
just
--
sit
down
was
used
all
through
the
trial
and
no
one
ever
objected
to
it.
everyone
understood
the
use
of
the
word,
the
court
reasoned
that
it
was
comparable
to
the
fansteel
case
wherein
you
had
your
sit
down
strikes.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
a
trespass
after
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
--
warning
and
the
court
in
this
instance
construed
that
to
include
a
sit
down
and
the
question
really
is
i
assume
what
is
a
sit
down,
what
did
–
prime
out
to
that
question,
the
question
is,
did
the
court
have
the
right
to
assume
if
you
were
to
sit
down
was
and
in
this
case,
it
did.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
as
comprehensive
in
its
language
that
it
might
have
been.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
think
it
assumes
that
the
parties
in
interest
of
this
thing
knew
that
there
was
warning
involved
it
also.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
city
ordinance
or
statute.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
that's
right.
they
--
you
have
to
incite
them
to
violate
some
city
ordinance.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
agree
with
you
your
honor.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well
i
agree
with
you,
just
suggesting
when
they
go
there
and
remain
for
long
time
would
not
be
sufficient.
the
essential
element
is,
whether
or
not
he
had
contemplated
when
they
went
there,
they
were
only
told
to
leave
when
he
--
first,
he
asked
for
volunteers,
well
of
course
just
to
go
there
and
sit
and
leave
when
they
were
told,
then
they
didn't
require
volunteers.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
but
he
assured
them
he
would
get
them
out
of
jail.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
go
along
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
--
with
your
honor
completely,
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
would
--
perhaps
be
one
of
the
first
to
concede
that
this
is
not
the
strongest
case
i
would
like
to
have.
the
question
is
--
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
the
rule
are
set
out
in
thompson
versus
city
of
louisville
and
as
affirmed
in
garner
versus
state
of
louisiana
is
still
in
effect
whether
we
have
any
evidence.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
any
evidence,
whatever.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
one
thing
is
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes.
well,
i
appreciate
your
honor's
proper
law
on
that
and
it's
not
an
easy
one
and
i
don't
think
that
it
is,
but
we
do
have
this
situation,
do
we
know
what
a
sit-down
demonstration
is?
they
cite
more
review
articles
that
deal
with
them
as
a
thing
of
common
experience.
it
was
a
fact
of
life
in
birmingham
when
these
things
came
up
to
trial
--
at
the
trial,
at
the
circuit
court
level.
they
were
an
established
fact
of
life.
when
i
asked
to
our
superiors
if
they
discussed
sit
downs,
abet
was
the
earlier
evidence,
he
said,
yes.
i
said
did
--
do
you
know
of
your
own
knowledge
that
they
in
fact,
these
people
are
attending
his
meeting
participated
in
the
sit
downs,
yes.
i
know
of
my
own
personal
knowledge,
yhey
did.
now,
where
is
any
question
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
--
what
a
sit
down
is.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
i
think
if
he
(voice
overlap)
something
else
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
i
don't
know
of
this
other
statements.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
we
don't,
we've
never
conceded
the
ordinance
was
valid
mr.
justice
douglas.
and
in
fact,
that
brings
me
up
to
a
point
that
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
don't
think
it's
the
question
of
judicial
notice
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
in
the
first
place
--
first
place,
these
petitioners
passed
up
--
well,
or
at
their
insistence,
they
had
no
jury.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
they
had
no
jury,
it
was
their
choice
and
they
elected
not
to
have
a
jury
to
try
the
case
so
the
court
sits
as
a
jury.
if
we
had
12
men
sitting
there,
and
i
think
the
two
are
the
same
in
this
situation
where
they
elect
to
let
the
court
act
as
jury.
he
is
charged
by
law,
juror
has
to
use
his
common
experiences,
his
common
sense,
his
common
knowledge
of
affairs.
and
he
finds
that
as
a
matter
of
common
experience
not
because
he
judicially
knows
something.
that
--
i
think
judicial
knowledge
and
things
we
know
as
a
matter
of
common
experience
as
jurors
are
two
different
things.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
he
is
admonished
--
i
didn't
say
that.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
i
didn't
say
that
to
you.[attempt
to
laughter]
i
said
simply
this,
a
court
judicially
knows
certain
things,
it
may
not
know
at
all
as
is
[inaudible]
[laughter]
but
jurors
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
this
is
purely
argument.
jurors
are
charged
by
the
court.
gentlemen
should
be
able
to
use
your
common
experiences.
those
things
you
know
are
common
facts
in
life.
that's
why
they
picked
12
of
them.
together,
a
mass
of
human
experiences
and
this
thing
was
widely
known,
it's
been
sensationalized
throughout
our
publications
and
i
think
outside
of
that
as
well.
but
it
was
not
something
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
this
rule,
a
little
more
stubborn.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
i
think
this
may
answer
that
question
and
please,
i
don't
want
to
go
--
i
want
to
save
some
time
after
the
solicitor
general,
15
minutes
if
i
may.
he
assured
them
he
would
get
them
out
of
jail.
now
admittedly
they
didn't
breach
the
peace.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
they
claim
that
and
we
claim
that.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
not
the
petitioners.
no,
the
restaurant
operator,
the
restaurant
operator
is
the
one
that
goes
to
jail
under
this
restaurant
ordinance
that
they
bring
up
here
in
this
court.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i'm
sure
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
no
sir.
the
ordinance
doesn't
say
that.
the
ordinance
puts
a
burden
on
a
restaurant
operator
for
that
petitions
and
inferences.
and
then
they
were
shown
whether
he
had
the
petitions
or
inferences.
that
isn't
in
the
record
even
if
we're
going
to
try
to
find
it
in
the
record.
that
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i'm
lost
a
moment
here.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
but
i
think
there
are
reasonable
inferences
we
may
draw
and
one
is
this
if
they
were
not
going
to
breach
the
peach,
what
were
they're
going
to
jail
for.
if
the
operator
of
the
restaurant
was
the
one
involved
in
not
putting
up
the
separate
doors
and
the
petitions
and
so
forth,
certainly
they
weren't
going
to
jail
for
his
people.
then
what
did
--
what
did
reverend
shuttlesworth
have
in
mind
when
he
assure
them
he
would
get
them
out
of
jail.
they
discussed
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
i
have
to
say
this
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
i
agree
with
his
honor
in
this.
this
may
not
have
been
the
only
conclusion
reachable
under
the
facts,
but
the
question
is
whether
the
court
acting
as
a
jury
had
any
evidence
before
it,
could
it
--
could
it
act
upon
any
thing
it
had
to
find
that
he
was
inciting
them
to
go
or
remain
on
the
premises
of
another.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
there
were
a
little
bit
more
to
it
because
there's
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
you
are
on
30
and
31
i
believe.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
of
course
--
of
course,
we
started
out
with
the
statements
made
by
gober
and
made
by
davis
on
another
occasion.
it
describes
the
fact
that
reverend
billups
came
out
to
school
and
then
he
rode
with
him
and
with
several
other
people
there
to
shuttlesworth
(inaudible).
mr.
watts
e.
davis
well,
he
discussed,
yes.
he
did
--
he
participated
in
the
discussion
and
asked
for
volunteers
and
assured
them
he'd
get
them
out
of
jail,
that
was
it.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
so,
that
that
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
that
was
[inaudible]
--
mr.
watts
e.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
that's
right
sir.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
that's
right,
that's
correct.
mr.
watts
e.
davis
if
i
may
take
the
liberty,
counsel
for
petitioners,
they
didn't
refer
to
the
other
record,
some
record
in
--
evidence
to
the
carried
six
over
the
meeting,
this
one,
he
carried
one.
one
or
six,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
but
nevertheless,
he
was
out
to
school
and
carried
a
student
to
the
meeting.
he
sat
there.
he
did
not
take
a
stand
to
negative
his
position.
but
at
least
there
were
some
evidence
there
that
he
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
scheme,
they
were
both
fraternities
of
the
same
--
of
the
minister
[inaudible]
mr.
watts
e.
davis
if
--
it
must
not
be
commented
upon
to
the
jury
but
whether
he
commented
or
not,
there
is
no
evidence
to
negative.
that's
the
only
point
i
make,
not
that
he
did
negative
that
there
is
nothing
to
make.
and
the
court
in
the
appellate
court
opinion
said,
there's
nothing
--
have
no
choice
but
assume
he
was
part
and
partial
but
he
didn't
get
up
leave.
there
was
no
evidence
of
that.
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
recuse
himself
in
any
way
from
any
responsibility.
but
he
did
take
someone
there,
he
did
remain
there
and
these
things
were
discussed
in
his
presence.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
a
fact-finding
of
group
of
people
gathering
one
person
maybe
standing
over
here
just
to
count
his
own
money,
but
i
think
they
generally
assumed
he
is
part
of
the
operation
unless
he
takes
the
stand
that
it
was
of
some
strong
defense.
thank
you.
