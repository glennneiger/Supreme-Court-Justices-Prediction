justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
considers
state
court
could
permissively
draw
from
the
evidence
that
shuttlesworth
told
them,
i
will
get
you
out
of
jail,
get
them
out
of
jail?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
real
question,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
finding,
if
any,
did
the
trial
court
make
on
that
from
that
evidence,
anything?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
isn't
this
the
appellate
court
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
the
court
of
appeals?
now
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
what
was
the
trial
court?
what
did
they
find,
if
anything,
on
the
significance
to
that
portion,
the
federal
or
the
state?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
that
necessarily
follow,
do
that
necessarily
follow?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
wouldn't
--
then
on
what
ground
did
the
gober
case
was
reversed
supposing
in
the
gober
case
it
was
reversed
on
the
ground
that
the
evidence
wasn't
sufficient?
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
permit
the
conviction
of
gober.
does
conviction
under
your
aiding
and
abetting
statute,
this
statute
we're
concern
with
here,
depend
upon
proof
that
the
substantive
crime
which
was
inciting
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
was
committed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
have
to
prove
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore,
you
have
to
qualify
your
statement
wouldn't
you
that
--
under
all
circumstances
reversed
it
in
gober
would
result
in
a
reversal
here
would
depend
on
the
ground,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
and
i'm
not
suggesting,
so
assuming
however
that
one
concluded
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
as
to
shuttlesworth,
could
billups
be
held
on
the
evidence
of
--
is
being
having
taken
students
over
to
shuttlesworth's
premises
plus
his
presence
there
as
an
aider
and
abetter
of
shuttlesworth's
incitement
either
under
the
provisions
of
the
abetting
provisions
of
this
statute
or
under
some
general
accessory
of
law
that
maybe
in
your
state?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
have
a
general
accessory
statute
in
alabama?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
alabama,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
you
give
me
the
citation
to
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'll
check
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
[inaudible]
the
rule
and
that
is
that
we
think
that
judge
the
constitutional
permissibility
of
the
inferences.
this
isn't
a
question
for
us,
it
should
--
as
it
might
be
if
we
were
sitting
under
the
state
appellate
court
and
reviewing
the
evidence.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
that
the
nature
of
the
state
questionnaire,
i
didn't
â€“
well,
i
suppose
an
issue
of
the
statement.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
say
about
billups?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
permissible
under
alabama
law
for
a
court
to
draw
an
inference
in
the
failure
that
if
the
defendant
take
a
stand
--
take
a
stand
in
a
criminal
case?
