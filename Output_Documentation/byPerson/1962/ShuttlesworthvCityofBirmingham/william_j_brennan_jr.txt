now
here,
was
there
any
reference
at
all
about

--
justice

how
about
on
appeal?
justice

j.
brennan,

how
about
in
the
brief
on
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

mrs.
motley,
from
what
said
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
page
44
of
its
opinion,
would
it
not
appear
that
they
sustained
the
conviction
solely
on
the
incite
language
of
the
ordinance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
any
aiding
and
abetting
is
out,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.

william
j.
brennan,
jr.

william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
the
clearest
in
the
world
but

the
court
said

any
event

sustain
this
on
the
incite
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
without
reference
to
aid
or
abetting.
justice

facing
this
only
on
this
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and

before
this
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
you
read
the
opinion
as
saying
that
the
conviction
can
rest
on
the
language
aid
or
abet?
