ms.
constance
baker
motley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
are
two
negro
ministers
here
on
the
grant
of
certiorari
by
this
court
to
review
their
convictions
by
the
alabama
state
courts
on
a
charge
of
inciting,
aiding
or
abetting
for
violation
of
the
trespass
after
warning
ordinance
which
we
have
just
discussed
as
a
basis
of
the
convictions
of
these
students
in
the
preceding
case.
now,
the
ordinance
in
this
case
also
appears
on
page
2
of
our
brief.
it
is
a
very
strong
ordinance
which
reads,
“it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
incite
or
aid
or
abet
in
the
violation
of
any
law
or
city
ordinance
or
any
provision
of
state
law,
the
violation
of
which
is
a
misdemeanor.”
now,
the
records
on
which
the
state
seeks
to
sustain
these
convictions,
contained
only
the
testimony
of
a
birmingham
city
detective,
and
this
detective
did
not
himself
personally
witness
any
of
the
facts
to
which
he
testified
on
this
trial.
he
was
present
in
the
recorder's
court
when
these
petitioners
in
this
case
were
on
trial
and
he
testified
in
the
circuit
court
on
the
new
trial
as
to
what
he
heard
other
witnesses
say
in
the
lower
court.
now,
the
entire
testimony
in
the
record
in
this
case
is
very
brief.
the
first
petitioner
is
reverend
shuttlesworth.
now,
the
testimony
as
to
what
reverend
shuttlesworth
did,
the
detective
said,
was
that
gober
and
davis,
petitioners
of
the
preceding
case,
testified
that
they
took
part
in
the
sit-in
demonstrations
on
march
31st,
1960.
and
that
they
went
to
reverend
shuttlesworth's
house
the
preceding
evening
and
discussed
sit-in
demonstrations.
reverend
shuttlesworth
was
present,
his
wife
was
present,
and
several
others
students
were
present
and
the
second
petitioner
in
this
case,
reverend
billups
was
present.
at
this
discussion,
somebody
prepared
a
list.
now,
who
prepared
it
or
what
the
list
was,
the
record
does
not
show.
the
only
other
thing
the
record
shows
is
that
reverend
shuttlesworth
asked
for
volunteers
and
at
one
point
said
or
announced,
that
he
would
get
them
out
of
jail.
now,
on
that
testimony,
reverend
shuttlesworth
has
been
sentenced
to
180
days
at
hard
labor
and
a
fine
of
$100.
now,
the
testimony
as
to
reverend
billups,
the
other
defendant
--
or
the
other
petitioner
in
this
case,
davis
one
of
the
students
in
the
preceding
case
reportedly
testified
that
reverend
billups
picked
him
up
on
the
campus
of
daniel
payne
college
which
davis
attends
and
drove
him
to
reverend
shuttlesworth's
house
and
that
reverend
billups
was
present
during
the
discussion.
what
reverend
billups
said
does
not
appear
in
the
record
at
all.
from
the
record,
it
appears
and
he
said,
absolutely
nothing
and
on
that
evidence,
reverend
billups
has
been
sentenced
to
30
days
at
hard
labor
plus
a
$25
fine.
now
we
say
first,
that
these
convictions
must
be
reversed
because
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
evidence
to
support
a
conviction
that
these
petitioners
urge
the
violation
of
any
valid
law
of
the
city
of
birmingham.
what
they
were
urging
was
a
sit-in
demonstration.
now,
in
order
for
this
court
to
find
that
what
they
were
urging
was
a
violation
of
some
valid
law
of
the
city
of
birmingham,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
would
have
to
find
that
a
sit-in
per
se,
as
the
court
below
finds,
is
a
violation
of
law.
now,
as
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
show,
a
sit-in
per
se
is
not
an
unlawful
activity.
in
the
garner
case
and
in
many
state
court
cases,
these
convictions
have
been
reversed
or
the
petitioners
have
not
been
convicted
and
their
cases
have
been
dismissed,
so
that
to
urge
somebody
to
participate
in
a
sit-in
demonstration
is
not
itself
a
violation
of
any
valid
law.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
because
all
they're
urging
is
a
protest
against,
in
this
case
state
enforced
segregation
and
i
think
we
have
a
right
to
protest
against
state
enforced
segregation.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
this
is
a
method
of
communication.
in
this
case,
these
people
went
in
to
this
place
and
sat
down
in
an
orderly
fashion.
there
were
only
two
involved.
they
didn't
carry
placards
into
the
place.
their
activity
was
of
--
in
protesting
was
appropriate
to
the
circumstance.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
they
test
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
not
in
this
case.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
the
--
there
was
no
evidence
that
shuttlesworth
urged
them
to
stay
there
until
they
had
been
arrested
and
until
they
had
been
ordered
to
leave.
there
is
no
testimony,
that's
we're
saying.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
in
the
circumstance
of
that
gober
case,
i
think
we've
shown
that
the
owner
ordered
them
out
and
i
think
that
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
think
that's
different.
i
think
that
they
were
going
in
there
in
this
manner
to
protest,
that's
true.
but
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
reverend
shuttlesworth
said
to
them,
stay
there
until
such
time
as
your
ordered
to
get
out
or
stay
there
until
the
police
come
along
and
arrest
you.
there
just
isn't
any
evidence
in
this
record
to
that
effect.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
that's
right,
exactly.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
the
state
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
the
state
court
drew
the
inference
from
that
that
shuttlesworth
had
said
to
stay
there
until
you're
arrested
and
even
the
court
had
difficulty
with
that
because
if
you
read
their
opinion,
they
were
quite
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
suttlesworth
told
them
to
stay
there
until
the
police
came.
what
they
actually
said
--
it's
at
the
bottom
of
page
44,
the
second
paragraph
in
the
bottom.
there
is
no
question
of
the
restriction
of
any
right
of
free
speech
or
other
simulated
right
derived
from
the
fourteenth
amendment
since
the
appellant
counseled
the
college
students
not
merely
to
ask
service
in
a
restaurant
but
urged,
convinced
and
arranged
for
them
to
remain
on
the
premises
presumably
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time.
and
they
used
that
word
because
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
shuttlesworth
said
to
stay
there
until
you're
asked
to
leave,
stay
there
until
the
police
came.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
they
might
have
gone
in
and
left
after
they
were
asked
to
leave
as
far
as
this
record
is
concerned.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
this
court
--
the
trial
court?
ms.
constance
baker
motley
this
is
the
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
court
of
--
the
court
of
appeals.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
there
was
no
opinion
by
the
trial
court
in
this
case.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
there
was
no
jury.
no,
but
they
were
tried
before
the
court
without
a
jury
and
convicted,
found
guilty
and
the
sentence
imposed.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
i
don't
believe
there
was
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
none
at
the
trial
court
level.
the
only
opinion
is
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
the
said
case.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
didn't
get
the
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
they
were
charged
with
aiding
and
abetting,
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
this
--
the
violation
of
the
trespass
after
warning.
now,
this
court
should
find
that
the
gober
convictions
are
invalid,
i
should
think
that
these
convictions
would
automatically
fall.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
if
this
court
should
free
gober
and
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
i
think
because
all
they
were
charged
with
was
urging
or
inciting
and
aiding
and
abetting
gober
to
commit
a
crime
and
if
he
is
found
not
to
have
committed
any
crime,
i
should
think
that
their
conviction
would
fall.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
evidence
wasn't
sufficient
to?
ms.
constance
baker
motley
otherwise
--
is
that
what
you
mean
now.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no
sir.
i
think
that
--
it's
correct
that
in
a
--
under
statute
like
this,
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
a
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
substantive
crime
was
actually
committed.
but
you
have
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
but
if
you
can
show
that
they
urged
the
violation
of
a
valid
law,
they're
still
guilty
whether
that
act
was
actually
committed
or
not,
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
yes,
i
see
what
you
mean
now.
that's
true.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
the
actual
--
if
the
actual
crime
had
not
been
committed,
he
could
still
be
convicted
of
a
crime
of
inciting
a
violation
of
a
valid
law.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
he
could
have
been
convicted
of
this
section
in
this
case,
but
we
say
that
his
conviction
is
invalid
because
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
urged
a
violation
of
any
valid
law.
all
it
shows
is
that
they
discussed
a
sit-in.
now,
a
sit-in
means
the
cause
that
you
go
in
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
you
stay
there
until
you're
asked
to
leave.
and
it
doesn't
necessarily
say,
you
stay
there
until
the
police
are
called
because
these
sit-ins
have
taken
various
forms
as
the
history
of
the
sit-in
show,
some
of
them
have
gone
in
and
some
have
left
when
they
were
asked
to
leave
and
they
were
not
arrested.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
i
think
that
what
happened
here
was
the
segregation
ordinance.
it
must
be
considered
as
we
ask
this
court
to
consider
it
and
considering
this
conviction
that
what
was
really
behind
it
was
the
segregation
ordinance.
we
ask
the
court
in
this
case
also
to
take
judicial
notice
about
segregation
ordinance
in
considering
what
was
behind
the
situation.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
no.
in
this
trial,
there
was
not
your
honor.
we
only
ask
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
a
law
that
the
court
of
the
state
could
have
just
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
pardon
me?
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
i
don't
believe
they
raised
that
on
the
appeal
on
this
case,
but
this
court
now
judicially
know
certainly
from
the
preceding
case
that
this
ordinance
is
in
the
background
of
this
situation.
and
what
shuttlesworth
was
urging
if
he's
urging
anything
which
was
a
law
of
the
city
of
birmingham,
a
violation
of,
it
was
this
invalid
city
ordinance
requiring
racial
segregation
and
certainly,
the
law
--
even
this
ordinance
doesn't
say,
you
may
be
convicted
for
urging
a
violation
of
an
invalid
law.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
it
appears
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
they
said
that
our
brief
talked
only
about
aiding
and
abetting
and
forgot
about
incite.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
now,
i
don't
know
whether
we
can
say
they
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
rest
on
it
solely
on
that
or
not.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
inciting,
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
they
said
that
we
just
talked
about
aiding
and
abetting
and
we
forgot
all
about
inciting
and
certainly,
there
was
inciting
here
to
violate
a
city
ordinance,
and
this
is
--
they
found.
and
then
they
--
as
i
say,
they
went
on
to
hold
a
sit-in
per
se
an
illegal
activity.
and
this
is
a
basis
on
which
these
people
were
convicted
just
by
finding
that
if
you
go
and
sit
in
a
place
and
even
if
you
leave,
in
other
words,
before
you're
asked
or
you
don't
intend
to
go
in
there
to
stay
until
the
police,
nevertheless
that's
a
form
of
trespass,
they
say
after
warning
just
to
go
in
a
place
and
sit
down.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
would
say
no,
because
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
billups
did
anything
at
all
except
take
this
man
there
and
sit
there.
i
don't
see
how
a
man
could
be
convicted
for
a
crime
and
if
you
read
gober's
or
davis'
testimony,
his
testimony
in
the
preceding
case
was
that
he
asked
reverend
billups
to
drive
them
over
there
when
he
saw
reverend
billups
on
their
campus.
of
course,
that's
not
in
this
record,
it's
in
the
preceding
record.
but
i
don't
think
that
this
man
billups
could
be
held
guilty
of
a
crime
because
he
sat
in
on
this
discussion
where
the
record
shows
that
he
said
absolutely
nothing.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
don't
really
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
understand
they
do
have
a
general
ordinance
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
we
don't
have
the
citations
to
that
your
honor.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i'd
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
the
rebuttal.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
have
nothing
further
your
honor.
