ms.

you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
we
should
reverse
the
gober
case,
could
this
stand
under
any
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
we
were
to
reverse
the
gober
case,
could
this
case
stand
under
any
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
it's
merely
aiding
and
abetting?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice

have
to
fall.
chief

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
i
was
just
wondering
if
the
court
according
to
your
theory
could
not
take
judicial
notice
of
the
provisions
of
an
ordinance
of
birmingham
which
specifically
stated
a
crime,
how
can
it
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
term
sit-in
contains
the
elements
of
a
public
offense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
--
how
does
it
acquire,
how
to
acquire
knowledge
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
that
a
juror
would
be
used
--
would
be
expected
to
use
his
common
sense
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
[inaudible]
such
things
but
the
judge
would
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
the
inference
is
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
couldn't
anyone
who
aided
and
abetted
him
go
to
jail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
these
people
be
aiding
and
abetting
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we've
had
--
we've
had
some
case
is
here,
the
garner
case
and
the
louisville
case
and
other
cases
where
they
did
put
him
in
jail
whether
there
wasn't
any
evidence
of
any
kind
against
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
say
that
under
those
circumstances
something
to
that
kind
could
happen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
motley,
do
you
have
any
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
very
well.
