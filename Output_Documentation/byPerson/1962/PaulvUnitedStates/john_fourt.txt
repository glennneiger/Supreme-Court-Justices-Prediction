mr.
john
fourt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellant
state
officers
appealed
in
this
case
from
a
district
court
injunction
permanently
closing
the
state
courts
to
the
state's
efforts
to
enforce
its
milk
stabilization
act
against
independent
contractors
selling
milk
to
commissary
grocery
stores,
officers'
clubs,
post
exchanges
and
to
troop
messes.
strictly
the
essentials,
there
are
two
basic
issues
here.
the
first
is
the
government’s
request
that
this
court's
decision
in
penn
dairies
versus
milk
control
commission
in
318
of
united
states
be
overruled.
that
case
held
that
the
state
of
pennsylvania
could
enforce
its
milk
stabilization
act
similar
to
california's
against
independent
contractors
selling
to
the
united
states
and
that
it's
statute
as
so
applied
was
constitutional
and
was
consistent
with
federal
procurement
policy.
the
second
issue
in
this
case
among
many
but
primary,
is
whether
the
government
acquired
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
three
particular
installations
in
california
without
complying
with
the
state
statutory
condition
that
the
government
inform
us
just
which
processors
were
being
taken
into
federal
jurisdiction.
following
the
entry
of
this
injunction
closing
the
state
courts
of
the
state,
prices
received
by
dairy
farmers
in
california
dropped
sharply.
they
dropped
to
the
extent
that
dairy
farmers
were
suffering
losses
at
the
rate
of
nearly
$7
million
a
year
based
on
federal
government
purchases
of
29
million
gallons
of
milk
in
fresh
form.
yes
sir?
mr.
john
fourt
the
district
court
held
the
complete
california
statutory
scheme
unconstitutional.
insofar
as
the
issues
in
this
case
are
concerned,
california
establishes
the
price
at
which
a
distributor
must
pay
the
dairy
farmer
for
milk
received
by
him
and
it
also
fixes
the
price
at
which
the
distributor
may
sell
that
milk.
as
construed
by
the
california
supreme
court,
the
statute
goes
no
further
than
the
distributor
and
does
not
apply
to
the
united
states.
the
three
installations
here
involved
are
castle
air
force
base,
travis
air
force
base
and
the
oakland
army
terminal.
the
state
statute
was
held
unconstitutional
on
two
grounds.
first,
that
delivery
of
the
milk
occurred
to
these
three
bases
and
that
these
three
bases
were
subject
to
the
power
in
congress
to
exercise
the
power
of
exclusive
legislation
under
article
i,
section
8,
clause
17
of
the
constitution.
in
a
second
equally
pervasive
ground
holding
the
state
statute
unconstitutional
was
that
the
state
statute
imposed
a
prohibition
on
the
government
and
its
contracting
officers
in
their
purchase
of
milk.
we
believe
that
both
of
these
constitutional
issues
were
posed
in
the
government's
complaints
and
adopted
by
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california.
there
being
present,
two
constitutional
issues
in
the
case,
it
was
proper
then
that
a
three-judge
federal
district
court
be
convened,
a
three-judge
court
being
properly
convened
then
this
court
has
direct
appellate
jurisdiction.
both
the
government
and
california
agreed
to
this
proposition.
following
the
court's
reservation
of
the
question
of
jurisdiction
to
the
time
of
oral
argument,
california
filed
also
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
judicial
circuit
before
judgment
in
that
court,
if
this
court
cannot
reach
the
merits
of
this
case
by
appeal,
then
we
ask
and
the
government
joins
us
in
asking
that
this
court
hear
the
merits
by
certiorari.
turning
to
the
merits,
the
purpose
of
the
milk
stabilization
act
of
california
and
of
the
23
other
states
who
have
similar
laws
is
to
protect
the
state
supply
of
a
vital
food
by
regulating
the
prices
for
milk.
the
state
establishes
minimum
prices
after
public
hearings
and
often
after
litigation.
this
public
setting
of
prices
is
to
be
distinguished
and
indeed
was
intended
to
prevent
collusive
price
setting
by
combinations
of
sellers.
we
think
that
this
then
emphasis
or
legislative
objective
of
the
california
statute
in
and
of
itself
shows
that
there's
no
conflict
with
the
congressional
objectives
and
the
federal
procurement
statutes
which
are
designed
to
prevent
private
collusive
setting
of
prices
by
its
emphasis
on
pre-competition.
minimum
wholesale
prices
and
the
said
fixing
of
it
by
the
state
was
found
necessary
by
the
legislature
because
of
internal
and
unique
competitive
problems
in
the
industry
which
require
that
distributors
be
assured
of
a
adequate
return
and
a
regular
return
money
which
would
allow
them
to
cover
their
own
expenses
and
have
enough
left
to
pay
the
dairy
farmers.
and
obviously,
if
the
dairy
farmers
do
not
receive
their
cost
production
in
the
long
run,
our
supply
of
a
vital
food
will
be
impaired.
the
government
contends
that
the
california
law
is
unconstitutional
because
it
imposes
a
direct
prohibition
on
the
government.
our
answer
is
that
the
district
court
there
erred
because
it
should
have
given
deference
to
the
contrary
opinion
by
the
california
supreme
court
that
in
the
penn
--
pacific
coast
dairy
case
in
319
cal.2d,
later
reversed
on
another
ground
by
this
court
that
the
milk
stab
--
california
milk
stabilization
act
does
not
apply
as
written,
not
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
but
as
written,
it
does
not
apply
to
the
government
nor
to
its
procurement
officers.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
that
once
the
government
enters
into
a
contract
as
a
matter
of
the
way
our
statute
is
written,
it
is
free
then
to
act
as
it
chooses
and
we
have
no
remedies
under
our
statute
against
the
government.
now,
to
construe
our
law
as
did
the
district
court
then,
adopts
a
construction
of
state
law
contrary
to
that
made
by
our
highest
state
court.
secondly,
the
state
officers
involved
in
this
appeal,
have
administratively
construed
and
agreed
with
an
interpretation
of
the
california
supreme
court
that
our
laws
do
not
apply
to
the
united
states.
therefore,
the
district
court
struck
down
our
law
on
a
hypothetical
ground,
a
ground
that
could
never
come
up.
thus,
our
statute
does
not
impose
a
prohibition
on
the
government.
now,
another
ground
of
attack,
the
government
says
that
if
california
regulates
the
price
at
which
a
distributor
may
sell
to
the
united
states,
the
effect
is
to
regulate
the
price
which
the
united
states
buys.
now,
we
submitted
that
this
is
not
true
factually
nor
legally.
the
united
states
is
affected
only
by
the
terms
of
its
contract
with
the
distributor
not
by
virtue
of
state
statute.
and
this
element
then
distinguishes
such
cases
as
kern-limerick,
where
the
statute,
as
written
encompassed
the
united
states
as
a
purchaser
in
that
case.
our
statute
as
written
here
does
not
encompass
the
united
states.
mr.
john
fourt
the
economic
burden
in
either
case
is
passed
on
to
the
united
states.
we
understand
that
an
even
handed
regulation
of
a
contract
with
the
united
states
which
caused
a
burden
which
is
passed
on
united
states
is
constitutional.
this
court
passed
on
this
identical
issue
in
the
penn
dairies
case
in
318
of
united
states.
now,
as
specifically
applied
in
our
case,
the
united
states
purchases
milk
for
a
number
of
different
uses.
it
purchases
milk
for
resale
through
officers'
clubs,
post
restaurants
and
post
exchanges.
these
activities
do
not
operate
from
federal
moneys,
but
through
private
revolving
funds.
they
are
federal
activities
since
they
are
operated
under
federal
regulation
but
there
is
no
loss
or
risk
of
loss
of
united
states
funds,
and
any
increase
in
the
burden
is
not
passed
to
the
federal
treasury,
but
to
patrons
of
officers'
clubs
and
post
restaurants
and
post
exchanges.
the
government
in
its
brief
makes
no
answer
to
our
contention
that
this
particular
activity
is
constitutional,
that
is,
that
the
application
of
our
law
to
independent
contractors
selling
to
officers'
clubs,
post
exchanges
is
constitutional
and
valid.
because
these
particular
activities
do
not
use
federal
funds,
their
purchases
do
not
come
under
the
armed
services
procurement
statutes
and
therefore
there
could
be
no
statutory
conflict
between
the
state
and
federal
regulations.
the
second
and
major
use
for
which
the
united
states
purchases
milk
is
for
resale
through
post
commissaries.
at
the
oakland
army
terminal
which
is
located
in
the
harbor
in
the
center
of
the
city
of
oakland,
78%
of
the
milk
purchased
by
the
united
states
at
that
base
is
resold
by
it
through
its
commissary.
here,
the
funds
used
are
revolving
funds,
but
are
appropriated
by
the
congress
in
a
continual
and
standing
appropriation.
the
commissaries
are
operated
without
cost
to
the
government
because
under
the
army
and
the
federal
regulation,
the
price
is
charged,
must
be
high
enough
to
have
the
commissaries
operate
without
cost
to
the
government.
we
think
that
the
congress
in
enacting
the
federal
procurement
statute
specifically
intended
to
accommodate
state
price
fixing
laws
with
respect
to
commissary
sales
because
they
expressly
provided
that
the
united
states
when
purchasing
for
resale,
need
not
go
through
the
formal
advertising
procurement
procedure,
but
may
use
non-competitive
and
negotiated
procurement.
by
negotiation,
this
means
that
contracting
officers,
an
individual
supplier
and
just
ordered
the
goods.
he
need
not
put
it
out
for
bids.
he
need
not
contact
more
than
one
supplier.
and
the
reason,
given
in
the
congressional
reports
is
that
a
commissary
often
as
it
has
been
buy
by
brand
name
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
its
patrons.
any
increase
in
cost
to
the
commissary
then
by
the
application
of
our
state
law
to
contractor
selling
to
the
commissary
are
not
borne
by
the
federal
treasury
but
are
then
--
go
back
into
the
purchase
price
of
the
patron
of
the
commissary.
the
congress
also
has
stated
in
the
appropriation
acts
to
the
department
of
defense
that
commissary
stores
may
not
be
established
in
areas
served
by
adequate
commercial
facilities.
again,
we
think
this
shows
that
the
commissary
stores
were
not
to
operate
in
competition,
door-to-door
competition
with
a
private
retail
store
which
must
comply
with
state
law.
the
government
maintains
242
major
military
installations
in
california.
these
installations
through
their
commissary
stores
sell
20
million
gallons
of
fresh
milk.
it
is
our
experience
that
if
this
invidious
discrimination
between
the
prices
of
milk
purchased
by
a
retail
grocery
store
and
a
commissary
store
continues
that
this
will
indeed
destroy
the
california
milk
stabilization
act.
another
category
is
that
the
united
states
to
a
lesser
extent
purchases
milk
for
use
in
the
troop
kitchens,
troop
issue
on
the
three
bases
involved
here.
the
average
was
30%
of
the
total
milk
was
used
for
troop
issue.
here
again,
we
think
congress'
intuitive
intent
that
the
procurement
statutes
are
to
accommodate
state
price
fixing
laws.
and
then
there
is,
the
court
noted
that
again,
procurement
officers
need
not
go
through
formal
advertising
procedures
and
procurement
but
may
use
non-competitive
negotiated
procurement
because
the
--
this
was
a
perishable
commodity
and
further
that
the
government
may
use
negotiated
purchase
where
competition
is
impractical
and
one
element
of
competition
of
course
is
eliminated
when
a
floor
is
set
on
the
price
at
which
a
contractor
may
sell
milk
to
the
united
states.
further,
the
congress
through
the
department
of
agriculture
subsidizes
the
purchase
of
milk
for
troop
issue
over
and
above
the
eight
ounce
basic
ration
at
the
rate
of
a
little
over
8
cents
per
quart.
the
reason
that
the
congress
granted
a
subsidy
was
to
ensure
a
national
adequate
quantity
of
milk.
now,
this
subsidy
on
purchases
by
the
armed
services
goes
through
the
contractor
and
then
goes
back
to
the
dairy
farmer.
we
think
it's
inconsistent
for
contracting
officers
utilizing
their
tremendous
bargaining
power
to
drive
the
prices
down
to
the
dairy
farmer
below
the
cost
production
while
another
agency
subsidizes
armed
forces
procurement
of
milk.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
we
have
two
very
large
--
mr.
john
fourt
no,
it's
a
minimum
price.
yes,
yes,
the
cooperatives
were
largely
organized
in
the
1920s
and
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
the
cooperatives
have
maintained
their
position
in
california.
roughly,
i
would
say
between
18%
and
20%
of
total
volume
is
handled
through
the
cooperative
associations
and
then
balanced
with
conventional
distributors
and
that
balance
by
and
large
is
not
changed
over
the
years.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
i'm
not
--
yes,
in
our
brief,
it
discusses
the
particular
conditions
of
instability
in
the
1930s
particularly
in
1935
which
caused
the
california
legislature
to
enact
our
milk
stabilization
act.
these
were
generally
a
nationwide
condition
and
which
led
to
similar
legislation
being
enacted
by
the
congress.
mr.
john
fourt
no.
the
problem
did
not
arise
in
california
until
a
surplus
of
milk
developed
and
that
surplus
of
milk
did
not
become
acute
until
after
the
close
of
the
korean
war.
and
at
that
time
then,
both
conventional
and
cooperative
distributors
sought
intense
competition,
government
contracts,
and
as
the
contract
price
for
the
government
lowered,
the
state
received
the
objections
of
producers
asserting
they
weren't
being
paid
the
minimum
price.
this
led
to
our
enforcement
action
in
the
state
courts.
the
appearance
by
the
united
states
assistant
attorney
general
and
assistant
attorneys
in
those
actions
in
the
trial
court
and
then
when
we
were
initially
successful
in
the
trial
court
then
united
states
filed
a
--
press
its
actions
in
the
united
states
district
court
to
close
our
state
courts.
i
think
a
second
answer
is
that
this
particular
problem
we
have
thought
was
settled
in
1943
in
the
penn
dairies
decision
and
we
think
that
for
that
reason,
the
government
asked
the
penn
dairies
decision
be
overruled.
the
united
states
relies
heavily
on
california
commission
versus
united
states
in
355
of
united
states
reports.
that
case
involved
a
non-economic
burden
on
united
states
primarily
excessive
delays
by
which
the
united
states
could
move
all
of
its
secret
military
traffic.
there,
the
united
states
had
no
choice
in
intrastate
shipments,
but
to
file
suit
or
to
subject
itself
to
california
regulation.
there
was
also
an
element
of
discrimination
in
that
the
kind
of
shipments
the
united
states
wished
to
make
were
a
type
called
traffic
all
kinds
which
they
could
ship
a
whole
train
load
at
one
rate
and
california
has
not
recognized
that
kind
of
shipment.
and
there,
there
was
an
invidious
discrimination
applied
against
a
contractor
with
united
states.
and
we
think
that
the
court's
discussion
in
that
case
of
the
discretion
given
to
procurement
officers
were
related
to
this
non-economic
burden
on
the
united
states
particularly
in
a
vital
military
function.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
we
think
that
this
is
a
matter
of
degree
and
in
the
sense
of
the
court,
i
use
it
there
within
the
terms
california
commission,
this
meant
a
matter
which
is
essential
to
the
defense
of
a
nation
in
the
answer
to
the
precise
facts,
i
would
say
that
that
is
not
in
the
same
category
as
the
untold
delays
of
military
shipments
going
forward
to
eastern
hostilities.
mr.
john
fourt
in
the
sense
that
this
is
certainly
within
the
power
of
commerce,
that
is
recognized.
again
though,
we
would
distinguish
between
military
shipments
going
forward
to
areas
of
hostilities
and
the
sale
of
milk
particularly
where
the
state
regulation
forwards
an
even
handed
burden
to
united
states.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
yes
we
would.
turning
to
the
other
issue
which
involves
the
land
jurisdiction,
the
government
concedes
that
california
has
not
made
a
session
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
these
three
bases
to
united
states
and
by
the
term
exclusive
jurisdiction,
we
refer
to
the
term
derived
from
international
law
that
when
one
government
makes
a
session
to
another
that
the
laws
of
the
old
sovereign
are
completely
obliviated
in
the
new
area
and
such
laws
that
are
carried
forward
are
carried
over
as
associated
laws
for
the
new
sovereign.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
my
point
was
that
we
were
eliminating
under
the
government's
theory
one
way
which
the
government
could
have
obtained
sovereignty.
mr.
john
fourt
that's
right.
california
in
1897
enacted
a
very
broad
statute.
the
statute
covered
all
lands
within
the
state
now
held
or
reserved
for
the
government
--
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
for
military
purposes
or
defense
or
which
may
hereafter
be
ceded
or
conveyed
to
said
united
states.
now,
this
was
in
19
--
1897
and
it
clearly
covered
then
all
lands
purchased
or
acquired
by
the
government
since
1872,
1872
being
the
date
of
the
statute
relied
on
by
the
government.
it
covered
all
lands
which
were
owned
by
united
states
at
the
time
that
california
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
1850
and
the
statute,
1897
statute
covered
all
lands
that
united
states
could
possibly
acquire
after
1897
because
it
covered
all
lands
obtained
by
conveyance
and
by
cession.
we
take
it
there's
only
two
ways
united
states
could
acquire
land.
since
the
1897
statute
then
we
submit,
qualifies
and
controls
any
land
previously
acquired
to
1897,
then
–
the
argument
then
as
to
what
quantity
of
jurisdiction
united
states
might
have
acquired
under
the
1872
statute
is
irrelevant.
now,
the
united
states
admits
that
california
can
constitutionally
condition
our
cession
of
jurisdiction
and
we
did
just
that
by
requiring
that
the
government
notify
california
just
what
lands
will
be
taken
into
federal
jurisdiction,
that
requirement
was
that
land
descriptions
and
plots
be
recorded
in
the
appropriate
country
recorder
in
california.
now,
the
government
relies
on
an
earlier
1872
statute
which
was
not
a
cession
statute,
said
nothing
at
all
about
cession
of
jurisdiction.
it
merely
said
that
california
consents
to
the
purchase
of
lands
within
the
state
for
federal
military
purposes.
a
similar
statutory
sequence
was
considered
by
this
court
in
james
versus
dravo
in
302
of
united
states,
and
there
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
we
run
into
a
somatic
difficulty
here.
first,
we
assert
that
the
1897
statute
controls
the
1872
statute
regardless
of
what
the
1872
statute
means.
and
we
say
that
the
1872
statute
did
not
tender
a
transfer
of
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states,
but
if
it
did,
it
was
qualified
by
the
1897
statute.
now
in
the
west
virginia
statute
considered
in
james
versus
dravo,
west
virginia
had
enacted
an
1881
consent
statute
very
similar
to
in
the
language
to
our
1872
statute
and
in
1931,
had
enacted
a
cession
statute
and
in
the
cession
statute,
it
said
that
the
terms
of
the
cession
statute
would
apply
to
any
lands
acquired
under
the
1872
--
under
the
1881
statute.
so
in
our
case,
we
say
that
the
reference
in
the
1897
statute
to
lands
acquired
by
cession
or
by
conveyance
applies
to
any
lands
acquired
by
united
states
in
the
1872
statute.
now
turning
to
our
difference
with
united
states
for
the
meaning
of
the
1872
statute,
we
assert
that
in
california
when
granting
consent
to
the
purchase
intended
thereby
to
give
congress
another
type
of
supremacy
power
over
such
lands.
it
granted
power
to
congress
to
legislate
and
exclusively
as
the
power
to
exercise
exclusive
legislation
and
the
term
exclusive
there
modifies
legislation
not
power.
the
government
would
reverse
the
context
there
and
would
say
that
this
was
an
exclusive
power
granted
to
congress.
mr.
john
fourt
no.
we
--
this
involves
the
pacific
coast
dairy
case
also
decided
in
318
of
united
states.
there,
as
we
read
that
case,
california
could
not
apply
our
milk
stabilization
act
to
a
situation
where
the
sale
occurred
within
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction.
the
delivery
occurred
with
an
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
and
the
consumption
of
that
milk
occurred
within
federal
jurisdiction.
and
california
in
that
case
admitted
all
those
facts
in
the
state
trial
court
by
filing
a
demurer
which
admitted
only
allegations
of
the
complaint
filed
in
that
action.
so
that
issue
was
never
litigated
in
the
pacific
coast
dairy
case.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
in
this
case,
let's
take
castle
as
perhaps
the
best
example.
the
united
--
california
filed
a
suit
to
restrain
a
distributor
from
making
sales
to
the
government
--
to
castle
at
less
than
the
state
regulated
prices
and
from
--
and
ordering
it
to
pay
its
producers,
dairy
farmers
minimum
prices
where
delivery
occurred
on
parcel
12
which
is
within
the
main
part
of
the
base.
ten
days
later,
the
government
ordered
the
contractor
to
discontinue
delivery
to
parcel
12
and
to
commence
making
deliveries
outside
of
the
base
to
another
little
parcel
called
parcel
a,
civilian
housing
project.
and
then
the
government
--
and
the
government
tractor
then
picked
up
the
milk
at
parcel
a
and
hauled
it
into
to
parcel
12
where
the
milk
was
consumed.
again,
at
castle,
the
contract
was
not
signed
there,
but
was
manually
approved
by
higher
headquarters
so
that
on
parcel
a,
the
contract
wasn't
signed
there
and
the
milk
wasn't
consumed
there.
all
that
occurred
on
parcel
a
was
the
delivery.
we
submit
then
that
this
small
relationship
between
parcel
a
and
the
government
then
would
distinguish
the
pacific
coast
dairy
case
from
our
situation
and
even
if
the
court
would
find
parcel
a
an
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
that
notwithstanding,
california
should
be
able
to
enforce
our
law
against
that
contractor
because
of
the
majority
of
things
that
occurred
in
this
entire
transaction
occurred
without
parcel
a.
mr.
john
fourt
the
record
does
not
disclose
where
that
higher
headquarters
were
located
but
we
believe
that
wherever
this
higher
headquarters
occurred
where
the
united
states
officer
who
had
authority
to
sign
contracts
over
$25,000
in
amount
where
he
executed
the
contract
and
accepted
the
offer
of
contractor
--
of
contract
tendered
by
the
independent
contractor.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
i
used
the
term
sale
here
to
mean
the
contract
which
made
provisions
for
the
subsequent
passing
of
title.
mr.
john
fourt
well
--
no,
i
would
not
say
it's
irrelevant.
i
would
say
passage
of
title
occurred
at
the
place
of
delivery
but
the
--
while
relevant,
in
fact
issue
alone
is
not
decisive
of
the
case
here.
thus,
for
example,
the
record
shows
that
the
united
states
has
changed
its
receiving
points
of
milk
both
at
travis
air
force
base
and
castle
air
force
base
so
as
to
take
delivery
on
parcels
which
have
the
best
jurisdictional
credentials.
if
the
court
prevails
of
this
issue,
if
they
can
find
one
acre
tract
in
california
where
the
government
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
then
the
government
can
take
delivery
of
all
of
its
milk
on
this
parcel
and
by
transshipping
itself
then,
supply
its
needs
throughout
california.
indeed
then,
this
one
parcel
would
be
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
california.
mr.
john
fourt
no,
both
because
the
statute
as
written
and
interpreted
by
our
highest
state
court
does
not
apply
to
the
united
states.
and
secondly,
if
the
california
legislation
did
change
our
statute,
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
once
the
milk
is
delivered
in
united
states
concededly
then,
it
is
beyond
state
control.
thus,
for
example,
the
out
of
store
commissary
grocery
store
price
is
beyond
our
control
as
far
as
we're
concerned
to
--
as
far
as
our
power
and
our
statute,
they
could
give
the
milk
away.
now,
with
respect
to
this
question
which
we
believe
of
first
impression
as
to
whether
the
power
of
congress
to
exercise
exclusive
legislation
of
these
bases
purchased
with
state
consent
as
to
whether
that
is
per
se
exclusory
of
state
law
or
is
exclusory
of
state
law
only
as
implemented
by
congress.
we
submit
that
policy
considerations
lend
themselves
to
deciding
that
this
is
not
per
se
preemptive,
but
is
a
power
which
is
effective
when
congress
implements
it.
and
we
take
it
--
conceded
here
that
congress
has
not
exercised
this
power
of
exclusive
legislation
to
our
state
law
although
we
grant
that
it
can
do
so
at
any
time.
the
president's
depart
--
in
a
departmental
committee
in
the
study
of
jurisdiction
recommended
that
federal
agencies
neither
acquire
nor
retain
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
this
is
for
the
reasons
that
these
areas
are
no
longer
part
of
the
states
and
the
residents
of
those
areas,
particularly
in
the
defense
housing
projects
in
the
--
can
no
longer
obtain
the
benefits
of
state
citizenship,
that
is,
the
states
have
held
for
example
that
a
resident
of
an
area
with
an
exclusive
legislation
cannot
have
as
the
state
probated,
cannot
secure
divorce,
his
children
may
not
attend
the
public
schools
and
in
many
states
that
such
person
lose
their
franchise.
and
for
this
reason
the
interdepartmental
committee
of
the
president
suggested
that
federal
departments
neither
acquire
nor
retain
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction.
and
indeed
the
army
regulations
point
the
same
fact
out
and
say
that
it
is
army
policy
neither
to
acquire
nor
retain
exclusive
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
fourt
no.
the
wholesale
price
regulations
will
have
to
stand
and
fall
on
whether
enough
occurs
within
these
military
installations
which
then
would
nullify
the
state's
attempt
to
enforce
our
statute
off
of
those
installations.
but
our
minimum
dairy
farmer
price
regulations
apply
to
the
transaction
between
the
distributor
and
the
dairy
farmer
far
removed
from
the
military
installation.
and
therefore,
the
land
jurisdiction
problem
is
not
decisive
or
dispositive
of
the
whole
case.
now,
the
united
states
had
suggested
that
this
court
not
pass
on
part
of
the
issues
of
this
case,
and
that
is
the
--
as
to
whether
the
state
can
apply
our
law
to
transaction
occurring
off
the
military
installations.
and
we
should
like
to
point
out
that
this
is
still
a
burning
issue
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes
sir.
the
district
court
held
our
entire
statute
unconstitutional
both
the
minimum
dairy
farmer
price
regulations
and
the
wholesale
price
regulations.
the
government
suggests
that
the
issue
on
diary
farmer
price
regulation
is
moot
because
as
a
matter
of
procurement
policy,
they've
said
they
will
not
assert
this
constitutional
immunity.
this
does
not
answer
the
problem
because
following
the
stay
granted
by
mr.
justice
douglas
we
repaired
to
the
state
courts
and
the
distributors
against
whom
we
sought
to
enforce
our
law
with
the
assistance
of
the
government
then
raised
this
constitutional
issue.
the
government
has
not
waived
it.
they
merely
said
they
will
not
assert
it
and
so
this
is
still
very
much
a
burning
issue.
secondly,
it
has
been
our
practical
experience
that
we
cannot
enforce
our
minimum
dairy
farmer
price
regulations
against
distributors
effectively
without
the
wholesale
price
regulations.
if
competition
forces
the
distributor
to
sell
milk
at
such
a
low
price
that
his
returns
are
inadequate
to
cover
anything,
but
his
own
cost
then
there's
nothing
left
for
the
dairy
farmer
and
this
has
been
our
experience.
well,
there
are
many
issues
which
we
have
not
raised
here
and
which
we
do
not
abandon
and
in
our
brief,
but
we
wish
to
summarize
that
under
the
state
milk
stabilization
act,
the
government
receives
the
lowest
wholesale
price
available
to
any
customer
in
california.
this
price
is
12%
below
any
price
that
a
competing
retail
grocery
store
can
obtain.
the
government
does
not
ask
for
equal
treatment,
but
preferential
treatment.
they
do
not
want
to
pay
roughly
18
cents
a
quart.
they
want
to
pay
11
cents
a
quart
and
the
invidious
discrimination
here
against
the
consumers
of
california
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
out
of
store
retail
price
in
commissaries
is
11
cents
a
quart,
the
out
of
store
minimum
competing
retail
grocery
store
price
is
24
cents.
now,
we
think
then
that
the
preferential
treatment
that
is
the
allowance,
the
better
treatment
given
to
the
united
states
under
state
regulation
is
now
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
our
statute
and
that
is
it
roughly
gives
the
united
states
2
cents
a
quart
advantage
over
any
other
wholesale
customer
other
than
state
agencies.
if
the
government
obtained
this
preferential
treatment,
we
feel
that
this
will
largely
undermine
and
destroy
our
state's
efforts
to
protect
its
vital
food
supply.
turning
to
land
jurisdiction,
we
feel
that
neither
the
constitution
nor
state
statutes
support
the
government's
claim
to
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
these
lands
and
that
it
asserts
this
claim
to
exclusive
jurisdiction
for
the
valid
purpose
of
obtaining
preferential
treatment
in
this
purchase
of
milk
and
that
it
--
in
its
claim
for
preferential
treatment,
it
minimizes
the
considered
policy
considerations
adopted
previously
by
the
army
and
by
the
president
in
his
report
that
on
balance,
state
jurisdiction
giving
municipal
laws
and
services
to
this
land
--
to
these
military
installations
is
preferable
to
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
fourt
yes
sir.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
oh,
that
is
quite
correct.
if
congress
speaks,
that
ends
it.
mr.
john
fourt
we
know
of
no
other
law
which
would
conflict
with
our
milk
stabilization
act
and
no
other
law
--
mr.
john
fourt
oh
yes,
of
course,
that
is
the
issue
here
and
there
of
course,
we
stand
on
penn
dairies
on
the
ground
that
the
procurement
statutes
there
held
not
to
conflict
with
the
pennsylvania
milk
stabilization
act
are
in
essence
the
same
as
those
in
effect
today.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
the
statute
authorizing
issuance
of
implementing
federal
regulations
give
no
hint
or
suggestion
if
those
regulations
were
to
supersede
state
law.
and
if
you
read
the
regulations
they
give
no
suggestion
or
hint
that
state
law
was
to
be
superseded.
their
emphasis
is
on
competition
and
we
think
that
they
fall
within
the
framework
of
congress
and
that
congress
in
its
procurement
statute
gives
no
hint
nor
has
it
overruled,
legislatively
overruled
the
construction
given
the
procurement
statutes
in
penn
dairies
by
this
court.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
that
their
burden
--
this
economic
burden
was
not
involved
--
that
involving
non-economic
burden,
interference
with
a
vital
military
function,
transportation
function.
now,
i
wish
to
clarify
what
would
occur
if
california
exercises
jurisdiction
of
these
military
bases.
the
federal
government
obviously
has
physical
control
of
those
bases
and
california
statute
may
not
impair
the
exercise
of
the
federal
function
of
those
bases.
but
on
many
of
these
bases
in
the
housing
authorities,
the
sheriffs
of
the
counties
in
california
are
called
in
to
maintain
order
among
the
teenagers
in
the
housing
districts
and
the
disputes
between
husband
and
wife
and
so
on,
so
that
california
peace
officers
do
perform
their
duties
and
exercise
their
jurisdiction
in
most
of
the
installations
today
in
california.
mr.
john
fourt
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
the
thrust
of
the
government's
argument
we
feel
is
pertains
to
what
has
been
described
as
the
enclaved
position.
that
is
their
claim
that
the
united
state
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
these
installations.
our
position
is
that
this
is
indeed
a
recondite
and
difficult
question,
a
question
of
first
impression.
we
want
to
illustrate
that
it
is
difficult
by
citation
of
two
different
lines
authorities.
first,
in
our
brief,
we
have
cited
that
the
(inaudible)
general
of
the
army
has
issued
two
opinions
which
are
inconsistent
with
the
position
now
taken
by
the
government.
those
opinions
are
cited
in
our
brief
so
that
we
have
inconsistent
administrative
interpretations
by
both
california
and
the
united
states.
and
secondly,
we
want
to
briefly
advert
to
the
case
cited
yesterday,
united
states
versus
cornell,
25
federal
cases,
page
646.
in
that
case,
the
court
had
before
it
a
1791
rhode
island
statute.
and
this
rhode
island
statute
was
a
session
statute
not
a
solely
a
statute,
such
our
1872
statute
but
a
session
statute.
in
essence
what
it
provided
was
that
rhode
island
would
make
a
session
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
united
states
over
lands
purchased
by
the
united
states
from
the
municipalities
or
private
landowners
with
the
consent
given
by
the
government.
mr.
justice
stewart
in
this
case,
then
as
one
of
this
alternative
grounds
held
that
the
attempt
by
rhode
island
to
condition
that
session,
jurisdiction
to
make
a
reservation
of
that
session
was
invalid
because
the
consent
to
a
purchase
brought
the
land
involved
within
article
i,
section
8,
clause
17
of
the
constitution
which
was
he
felt
exclusory
of
state
law
and
therefore
this
attempted
reservation
of
jurisdiction
was
invalid.
this
case
was
reviewed
by
this
court
in
james
versus
dravo
contracting
company
in
302
of
united
states
and
there
the
court
expressly
disapproved
this
holding
by
mr.
justice
(inaudible)
sitting
on
circuit
that
clause
17
was
exclusory
to
the
extent
that
it
would
prohibit
a
state
from
making
a
condition
to
a
session
of
jurisdiction.
now
our
point
here
is
that
if
clause
17
is
construed
by
this
court
was
not
exclusory
so
as
to
prevent
a
state
from
conditioning
its
consent
then
it
is
not
exclusory
at
all
except
as
implemented
by
congress.
now,
turning
then
to
the
procurement
argument
and
particularly
the
question
which
mr.
justice
goldberg
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
sir?
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
yes.
with
respect
to
that
point,
it
is
our
position
that
the
1940
amendment
to
revise
statutes
section
355
which
is
requires
the
notice
requirement
which
the
united
states
must
give
to
a
state.
first
required
a
notice
and
if
a
notice
given
here
by
united
states
was
no
notice
at
all
because
it
said,
“we
accept
jurisdictional
where
all
lands
owned
by
united
states
within
california,
give
no
notice
at
all
to
california
what
parcels
were
involved.”
secondly,
that
as
construed
by
the
department
of
justice
in
its
brief
to
this
court
in
adams
versus
united
states
that
the
language
in
revised
section
355,
incorporated
such
applicable
notice
requirements
of
the
state.
and
they
actually
mentioned
that
if
a
state
has
a
requirement
for
the
filing
of
a
plats
and
meets
in
bounds
then
the
united
states
should
comply
with
that
recording
requirement.
therefore,
(inaudible)
congress
has
given
that
direction.
we
feel
that
in
this
case
united
states
did
not
comply
with
the
statutory
direction.
secondly,
the
implementation
by
congress
of
this
power
of
exclusive
legislation
has
not
clearly
superseded
state
law
and
one
implementation
of
course
is
the
procurement
statutes.
there
are
other
regulations
for
example
that
a
state
warrant
of
arrest
shall
not
be
honored
on
a
federal
military
installation
except
in
the
discretion
of
the
commanding
officer
and
there
are
a
number
of
such
regulations.
again,
congress
has
not
come
on
forth
and
clearly
said
that
our
procurement
statutes
are
invalid
as
applied
to
contractors
with
the
government.
now
in
response
to
your
question,
the
mr.
solicitor
general
said
that
the
crux
was
whether
the
state
can
circumscribe
to
any
extent
the
way
which
the
government
can
contract.
now,
we
take
it
here
that
what
the
united
states
is
saying
that,
it
is
no
concern
of
the
governments
whether
the
contractor
with
united
states
received
so
little
on
his
government
contract
that
he
is
unable
to
pay
his
dairy
farmers
for
his
milk,
his
labor
cost
in
a
highly
organized
industry.
indeed,
the
court
has
before
it
a
brief
of
petaluma
cooperative,
a
small
cooperative
in
northern
california
were
on
pages
4
and
6.
it
describes
how
it
was
driven
from
the
market
by
virtue
of
this
acute
competition.
now,
what
caused
this
competition?
well,
the
government
is
the
largest
purchaser
of
milk
in
california.
and
secondly,
its
contracts
are
tremendously
powerful
leverage
in
the
hands
of
the
government.
for
example,
the
contract
at
travis
was
for
the
amount
of
$500,000
worth
of
milk
and
that
at
travis
was
for
$450,000
worth
of
milk.
perhaps
distributor
was
laughing
but
he
said
he'd
burn
his
grandmother
alive
for
that
kind
of
money.
now,
inevitably
this
law
situation
which
the
government
in
driving
a
hard
bargain
will
drive
upon
contracts
with
the
government
will
undermine
the
efforts
of
the
state
of
california
and
other
states
to
correct
the
very
situation,
the
very
economic
instability
which
the
government
seeks
to
take
advantage
of.
in
summary
then,
we
feel
that
california
has
been
rather
sharply
dealt
with
here.
we
have
questions
of
statutory
constructions
of
state
law
which
were
precluded
from
deciding
under
state
courts.
we
feel
that
the
action
of
the
government
here
prevents
us
from
protecting
our
supply
of
a
vital
food
which
is
also
vital
to
the
government.
we
therefore
ask
the
judgment
be
reversed.
