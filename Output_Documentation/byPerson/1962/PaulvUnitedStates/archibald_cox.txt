mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
it
might
help
to
put
the
legal
issues
in
context
if
i
were
to
take
a
moment
to
summarize
the
facts
of
the
case
and
the
way
it
got
here.
you
will
recall
that
this
case
involves
the
procurement
of
milk
at
three
large
installations
of
the
military
services
in
california,
travis
air
force
base,
castle
air
force
base
and
the
oakland
army
terminal.
the
milk
prior
to
the
beginning
of
this
controversy
was
purchased
through
the
normal
methods
of
procurement
by
the
department
of
defense,
that
is
to
say
bids
--
there
was
an
advertisement
for
bids.
the
government
received
responses.
it
accepted
a
bid
and
then
in
due
course,
the
goods
were
delivered.
most
of
the
contracts
were
for
a
time
at
prices
below
any
of
the
california
milk
prices
which
i'll
come
to
in
a
moment.
in
the
particular
cases
with
which
we
deal
as
of
the
time
of
the
trial,
the
officer
who
advertised
for
and
received
the
bids
was
on
the
area
--
in
the
areas
over
which
we
claim
exclusive
federal
territorial
jurisdiction
and
deliveries
were
made
within
the
areas
over
which
we
claim
exclusive
territorial
jurisdiction.
most
of
the
contracts
before
he
could
send
out
notice
that
he
accepted
the
bid
had
to
be
referred
to
some
higher
authority.
the
record
doesn't
show
where
the
higher
authority
was,
he
might
have
been
here
in
washington
d.c.
for
all
the
record
shows,
he
would
notify
the
procurement
officer
at
castle
or
travis
or
oakland
as
the
case
maybe
and
that
officer
would
then
send
out
from
his
location
within
the
federal
enclave
i
assume
for
the
description
that
it
is
a
federal
enclave,
the
notice
to
the
milk
company
and
in
due
course
delivery
would
be
made
at
that
same
spot.
many
of
these
purchases,
i
say,
were
at
prices
below
the
prices
fixed
by
california
law.
now,
california
statute
provides
a
system
of
milk
price
regulation
which
authorizes
the
director
of
agriculture.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
to
tell
the
truth,
i
haven't
investigated
that
particular
point.
mr.
archibald
cox
over
certain
--
up
to
certain
amounts
i
believe.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
--
i
don't
really
know
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
contribute
any
significance
to
it
except
that
i
suppose
if
it
wasn't
a
two-way
contract
then
it
is
all
the
clearer
that
the
sale
was
made
within
the
enclave,
but
we
would
think
the
sale
was
made
within
the
enclave
anyway
regardless
because
you
see,
the
sale
i
think
means
not
contract
of
sell
but
sale.
and
second,
i
take
it
if
i
remember
by
contracts
correctly
that
a
contract
would
have
been
made
when
he
mailed
the
notice
of
acceptance
and
he
mailed
that
within
the
enclave.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
they're
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
there
are
three
--
i
think
really
a
correct
answer
to
your
question
would
involve
two
points.
one,
the
state
of
the
sovereignty
over
on
these
bases
in
california
varies
considerably
because
they
were
acquired
at
different
times
and
there
have
been
different
state
statutes
from
time
to
time.
the
policy
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
military
is
varied
from
time
to
time.
so
it
wouldn't
be
fair
for
me
to
say
that
these
are
typical
of
all
the
bases
in
california.
it
is
true
--
two
other
things
are
true,
however,
there
are
many
other
installations
where
we
would
take
exactly
the
same
position
with
respect
to
territorial
jurisdictions
we
do
here.
these
are
the
ones
where
we
felt
the
interference
as
i
will
describe
in
the
moment.
mr.
archibald
cox
second,
i
should
emphasize
mr.
chief
justice
that
two
of
the
three
arguments
on
which
we
rely
here
apply
regardless
of
whether
this
was
territory
over
which
we
have
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction.
so
that
we
assert
with
respect
to
the
procurement
statute
regulation
and
with
respect
to
the
implied
constitutional
immunity
that
regardless
of
the
question
of
territorial
jurisdiction,
california
cannot
regulate
these
contracts
of
the
united
states.
i
was
about
to
describe
very
briefly
the
basic
california
milk
control
law.
i
think
the
essential
parts
of
it
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
are
three-fold.
first,
it
authorizes
the
director
of
agriculture
by
order
to
establish
the
prices
which
handlers
or
distributors
and
this
would
include
cooperatives
acting
as
handlers
or
distributors
they
must
pay
to
the
funds
for
reasons
i
will
explain
later,
we
are
not
concerned
with
those
prices
any
longer
in
this
case.
second,
california
authorizes
the
director
of
marketing
or
agriculture
to
set
the
price
charged
by
the
distributor
or
handler
or
perhaps
i
could
call
properly
the
resale
price
and
it
is
those
prices
with
which
we
are
now
concerned
in
this
case,
and
only
those
prices
with
which
we
are
now
concerned.
there
came
a
time
when
the
california
authorities
threatened
the
handlers
who
were
selling
milk
to
the
government
at
prices
below
the
california
price
that
their
licenses
would
be
taken
away
that
they
would
otherwise
proceed
against
them
under
the
california
law
and
this
led
to
the
handlers
no
longer
bidding
in
free
competition
but
submitting
bids
in
accordance
with
the
state
minimums.
accordingly,
the
united
states
in
order
to
protect
this
interference
with
its
prospective
sellers
brought
a
bill
against
the
california
authority
to
enjoin
them
from
taking
steps
to
enforce
the
california
milk
control
law.
and
as
the
case
was
originally
tried,
it
apparently
did
involve
both
an
effort
to
stay
enforcement
generally
and
a
direction
not
to
proceed
further
with
this
particular
case
in
the
state
courts.
as
to
that
particular
case,
we
think
there
may
be
some
doubt
about
the
propriety
of
the
interlocutory
orders
of
the
final
orders
is
simply
in
the
customary
form
and
stays
state
authorities
from
taking
steps
to
enforce
the
law
and
therefore
involved
we
think
no
interference
with
proceedings
in
a
state
court
which
would
of
course
violate
the
jurisdictional
extensions.
that
suit
was
based
upon
three
grounds.
first,
the
untied
states
alleged
that
these
three
bases
were
within
its
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction
and
that
therefore
any
attempt
by
california
either
to
apply
its
laws
directly
within
those
bases
or
to
prosecute
people
for
taking
steps
which
would
be
unlawful
only
because
of
what
they
did
later
within
those
bases
was
an
interference
with
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
unconstitutional
under
the
pacific
coast
dairies
case.
second,
we
asserted
that
the
california
milk
control
law
as
applied
was
in
conflict
with
the
armed
forces
procurement
act
and
the
regulations
under
it
and
therefore
it
was
invalid
under
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
and
for
that,
the
united
states
relied
on
the
california
public
utilities
commission
case.
the
third
ground
which
was
raised
in
the
lower
court
and
which
we
still
press
was
that
for
california
to
apply
its
milk
control
law
to
these
purchases
regardless
of
any
question
of
territorial
jurisdiction
and
regardless
of
any
question
of
federal
statutes
was
in
direct
conflict
with
the
implied
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states.
and
we
continue
to
press
all
three
points.
now
i
should
emphasize
--
i'm
getting
a
little
hand
of
myself,
the
district
court
called
in
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
then
you
don't
have
to
decide
the
other,
that's
correct.
that's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
not
excluded.
mr.
archibald
cox
excuse
me.
that
--
i
did
not
give
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
a
100%
accurate
answer.
i'd
prefer
not
to
get
in
to
the
detail
now
but
so
far
as
the
procurement
statutes
go,
there
was
some
of
the
milk
bought
at
some
--
one
of
the
bases
which
would
not
be
under
the
procurement
statute.
this
is
the
milk
bought
out
of
the
officer's
club
revolving
fund
and
i
suppose
strictly
that
that
would
--
if
you
decided
first
on
that
ground,
it
would
still
remain
at
x
percent
of
the
milk
which
have
to
be
--
mr.
archibald
cox
you
would
reach
that
you
would
have
to
consider
one
or
three
--
mr.
archibald
cox
in
order
to
take
care
of
that,
yes.
now,
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
first
two
--
mr.
archibald
cox
first
two.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
didn't
mention
the
third.
the
district
court
did
issue
the
injunction
on
the
first
two
grounds
as
mr.
justice
stewart
said
and
we
--
and
the
state
brought
the
case
here
upon
a
direct
appeal.
the
court
postponed
the
question
of
jurisdiction
until
the
argument
on
the
merits
citing
kessler
against
the
department
of
safety,
the
utah
case
involving
the
discharge
of
bankruptcy.
we
think
it's
quite
plain
that
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction
on
appeal.
the
question
is
of
course
you
will
recall
is
whether
a
three-judge
court
was
required.
we
think
it's
plain
that
a
three-judge
court
was
required
to
consider
at
least
the
first
and
third
grounds
on
which
we
challenged
the
state
statute.
certainly,
the
ground
that
we
challenge
it
because
it
invaded
the
direct
implied
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
raises
a
direct
constitutional
issue.
there's
no
possible
question
of
interpretation.
the
first
ground
maybe
a
little
more
complicated,
but
since
california
asserts
that
regardless
of
whether
we
have
exclusive
territorial
jurisdiction,
she
may
apply
the
state
law
within
federal
enclave,
that
too
i
take,
raises
a
direct
constitutional
question.
of
course
the
three-judge
court
is
required
where
there
are
such
direct
constitutional
challenges
to
a
state
statute
even
so
the
state
statute
is
challenged
on
some
other
ground
such
is
that
the
area
has
been
preempted
by
the
federal
statute
which
was
our
second
ground.
the
three-judge
court
being
required,
the
case
comes
here
on
direct
appeal
but
even
so
the
three-judge
court
may
base
its
decision
on
some
non-constitutional
ground
or
as
i
would
put
it
here,
some
indirectly
involved
constitutional
ground
that
i
think
the
court
doesn't
have
to
deal
with
the
problem
involved
in
the
kessler
case
because
there
clearly
is
jurisdictional
under
any
theory.
i
turn
now
therefore
to
our
first
ground
for
sustaining
the
decision
below,
the
argument
that
the
territory
in
which
the
sales
were
made
is
under
the
exclusive
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states,
so
this
attempted
state
regulation
violates
article
i,
section
8,
clause
17
of
the
constitution.
the
basic
elements
of
the
government's
case
in
that
regard
are
really
very
simple.
article
1,
section
8,
clause
17,
you'll
recall,
provides
that
“congress
shall
have
power
to
exercise
exclusive
legislation
in
all
cases
whatsoever
over
such
a
district,”
this
is
the
district
where
the
government
seated,
“and
to
exercise
like
authority
over
all
places
purchased
by
the
consent
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
in
which
the
same
shall
be
for
the
erection
of
forts,
magazines,
arsenals,
dock-yards
and
other
needful
buildings.”
here
we
say
that
the
government
purchased
the
land
that's
involved
in
these
cases
that
it
was
done
by
the
consent
of
california
given
by
a
statute
that
the
united
states
accepted
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
as
required
by
a
1940
federal
statute.
and
that
the
result
under
a
long
line
of
decisions
by
this
court,
state
courts,
lower
federal
courts,
is
that
did
the
state
lost
any
power
to
tax
or
to
regulate
in
any
way
conduct
within
that
federal
enclave.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
believe
they
were
all
purchased
by
agreement.
the
details
are
in
the
record.
i
now
propose
to
take
the
travis
air
force
base
and
go
through
the
argument
in
somewhat
more
detail.
i
was
just
trying
to
provide
a
skeleton
on
which
to
put
the
more
complicated
points.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
i
should
have
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
i
can
answer
that
a
little
more.
indeed,
i
haven't
planned
to
state
the
facts
at
the
beginning
and
i
got
a
little
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
it's
an
important
point
to
my
case
really.
i
did
want
to
emphasize
and
explain
the
reason
for
my
statement
that
we
were
not
any
longer
concerned
with
the
prices
received
by
the
farmers,
milk
producers.
now,
originally
i
think,
as
the
case
was
litigated
in
the
lower
court,
that
was
to
a
degree
involved
and
when
the
case
first
came
up
on
direct
appeal,
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
the
government
either
could
complain
of
the
regulation
of
those
prices
or
even
if
it
could
whether
it
should
and
after
discussion
within
the
executive
branch
of
the
government,
it
was
decided
that
the
government
should
not,
whether
it
could
or
not,
should
not
seek
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
state
prices
so
far
as
producers
were
concerned.
and
we've
taken
that
out
of
the
case
i
think
completely,
but
if
we
haven't,
i
do
so,
so
far
as
i
have
power
now,
in
three
ways.
in
the
first
place,
we
consented
to
a
partial
stay
issued
by
justice
douglas
which
modified
the
original
injunction
so
as
to
stay
such
portion
of
said
injunctions
which
enjoin
appellants
from
enforcing
against
producers
or
distributors
of
milk
or
milk
product,
the
minimum
producer
of
milk
price
regulations
promulgated
by
california
and
so
forth.
second,
we
stated
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
that
this
was
our
view.
third,
the
secretary
of
defense
in
response
to
an
inquiry
from
an
order
really
from
a
congressional
committee
wrote
to
the
appropriation
committees
of
the
house
and
senate
this
summer.
the
state
law's
most
concern
of
this
connection
is
those
which
establish
minimum
prices,
he
was
talking
specifically
about
milk
prices
and
only
milk
prices.
the
department
of
defense
does
not
oppose
state
regulation
of
minimum
prices
to
be
paid
by
handlers
to
farmers
nor
does
it
oppose
milk
marketing
orders
issued
by
the
u.s.
department
of
agriculture
which
likewise
regulates
the
amounts
to
be
paid
to
the
farmers
who
produce
milk.
it
does
oppose
state
regulation
if
the
price
is
to
be
charged
by
handlers
and
others
selling
milk
to
the
federal
government.
this
leaves
--
takes
out
of
the
case
entirely,
so
far
as
i
can
see,
any
question
of
the
welfare
of
the
farmers
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
the
stay
--
i
think
even
if
there
were
to
be
an
affirmance,
the
qualification
added
by
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
justice
douglas
should
be
written
into
the
decree
without
any
--
mr.
archibald
cox
to
avoid
any
doubt
--
i'm
not
sure
if
the
decree
really
covers
it
anyway.
but
to
avoid
any
doubt,
it
should
be
put
in.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
not.
the
department
of
agriculture
has
now
for
23
or
4
years
fixed
the
prices
to
be
paid
produced.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
if
anything
[inaudible]
there
had
been
many
places
where
that
is
the
only
--
mr.
archibald
cox
they
can
be
fixed
at
any
level
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
enforced.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
the
way
it
is
worked
out
under
many
federal
orders
has
been
that
the
distributor
has
to
charge
an
amount
necessary
to
pay
what
he
is
required
to
pay
the
producers
or
else
he
goes
into
bankruptcy.
but
the
--
as
a
--
at
least
in
my
experience
with
milk
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
carriers
to
that
result
has
not
been
that
thing
distributors
regarding
bankruptcy.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
in
effect
that
it
wouldn't
and
couldn't
that
what
we
are
bargaining
over,
what
we're
trying
to
protect
here
--
mr.

some
of
the
small
dairies
would
not
be
as
effected,
they
have
been
selling
--
they
would
not
be
able
to
sell
to
the
army,
that's
correct
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
but
that
question
of
policy,
i
suggest,
is
not
one
for
--
to
be
decided
in
constitutional
terms
or
for
california
to
decide.
here,
coming
back
now
to
the
question
of
exclusive
territorial
jurisdiction,
i
would
like
to
follow
through
with
the
travis
air
force
base
in
order
to
show
in
a
little
more
detail
our
argument
and
try
to
meet
california's
contentions.
the
lands
constituting
those
parts
of
the
base
in
which
the
milk
was
purchased
or
delivered
in
the
manner
i
described
before
was
brought
in
this
case
from
private
owners
between
december
4,
1942
and
march
1,
1943.
there's
no
question
that
the
land
was
purchased
for
the
military
purposes,
forts,
arsenals,
dock-yards
and
other
needful
buildings
within
the
constitutional
frame.
we
contend
that
california
gave
her
consent
to
that
purchase
by
the
united
states
under
a
statute
which
is
set
forth
at
page
99
of
our
brief.
the
section
34
of
the
california
political
code
begins
down
to
the
last
quarter
of
that
page.

mr.
archibald
cox
page
99
of
the
government's
brief
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
which
is
--
and
i'm
about
to
call
your
attention
to
section
34
of
the
california
political
code.
the
legislature
consents
to
the
purchase
or
condemnation
by
the
united
states
of
any
tracts
of
land
within
the
state
for
the
purpose
of
erecting
forts,
magazines,
arsenals,
dock-yards
and
other
needful
buildings
upon
the
express
condition
and
then
there
followed
three
conditions
that
civil
process
issued
by
the
courts
of
the
state
shall
be
effective,
the
criminal
process
issued
by
the
courts
of
the
state
shall
be
effective
and
that
the
state
shall
retain
certain
powers
of
taxation,
but
except
for
those
qualifications,
the
consent
to
purchase
is
given
by
that
statute
and
in
unqualified
terms.
now
our
argument
is
that
under
the
very
words
of
the
constitution
itself,
once
the
state
have
given
consent
to
purchase
the
land,
the
united
states
then
has
the
exclusive
power
of
legislation
which
means
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
that
that
then
and
there
automatically
excludes
any
exertion
of
authority
by
california.
mr.
archibald
cox
on
--
since
1940
and
therefore
in
this
case,
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
united
states
to
state
that
it
accepts
such
jurisdiction
but
there
are
letters
from
the
secretary
of
war,
secretary
stimson
to
the
governor
of
california
stating
that
the
united
states
does
accept
jurisdiction
over
the
land
in
question
and
it
is
immaterial
whether
the
government
then
enacted
any
legislation
dealing
with
the
territory.
of
course,
there
many
laws
were
made
applicable
by
the
assimilation
act
and
other
criminal
laws
had
been
enacted
dealing
with
conduct
within
the
base.
but
it
takes
nothing
more
than
the
purchase
with
the
consent
of
the
state
and
that
consent
is
given
here.
now
the
earliest
expression
of
that
kind
that
i
have
been
able
to
find,
goes
back
to
an
opinion
to
mr.
justice
story
in
united
states
against
cornell.
there
he
said,
in
summing
up
to
the
jury,
that's
much
decided
in
the
forts
case,
“when
therefore
purchase
of
land
for
any
of
these
purposes”,
that
is
forts,
magazines
and
so
forth,
“is
made
by
the
national
government
and
the
state
legislature
has
given
its
consent
to
the
purchase,
the
land
so
purchased
by
the
very
terms
of
the
constitution
ipso
facto
falls
within
the
exclusive
legislation
of
congress
and
the
state
jurisdiction
is
completely
ousted”.
this
is
the
necessary
result
where
exclusive
legislation
is
--
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
attendant
upon
exclusive
legislation
and
the
consent
of
the
state
legislature
is
by
the
very
terms
of
the
constitution
by
which
all
the
states
are
bound
to
which
all
apprise
a
virtual
surrender
and
session
of
its
sovereignty
over
the
place.
then
he
directed
himself
a
few
paragraphs
later
to
one
of
the
arguments
made
by
california
here
to
with
that
they
didn't
expressly
say
we
cede
jurisdiction
and
they
simply
consented
perjury
and
referring
to
that
argument
as
the
argument
of
the
prisoner,
he
said
here,
the
argument
of
prisoner's
counsel
is
in
the
first
place
that
the
act
of
rhode
island
contains
no
cession
of
jurisdiction
in
terms
and
the
consent
of
the
legislature
through
the
government
and
the
purchase
is
not
a
virtual
session
of
its
sovereignty
over
the
place.
that
argument
has
been
sufficiently
considered
already
from
the
passage
i
previously
read
and
stands
repudiated
by
the
expressed
terms
of
the
constitution.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
it's
quoted
at
length
in
several
of
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief
including
the
fort
leavenworth
case
and
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
van
devanter
in
surplus
trading
against
cook.
i
thought
this
was
a
little
clearer
statement
than
some
of
the
others.
the
citation,
it's
to
mason,
mr.
justice
black,
i'm
afraid
i
lost
the
page
when
i
closed
the
book.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
are
many
other
decisions
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
there
are
many
decisions
by
this
court
and
innumerable
other
courts
stating
that
same
proposition.
california's
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
based
upon
another
california
statute,
conveniently
found
at
page
98
of
our
brief,
down
at
the
bottom.
this
is
the
california
statutes
1897
which
was
carried
forward
and
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
these
purchases.
there
it
provides,
the
state
of
california
hereby
cedes
to
the
united
states
of
america,
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
all
lands
within
the
state
now
held,
occupied
or
reserved
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
for
military
purposes
or
defense
or
which
may
hereafter
be
ceded
or
conveyed
by
the
united
states
for
such
purpose.
and
then
there
are
--
oh,
then
the
next
phrase,
provided
that
a
sufficient
description
by
meats
and
bounds
and
a
map
or
plat
of
such
lands
be
filed
in
the
proper
office
of
record
in
the
county
in
which
the
same
are
situated.
now
in
the
case
of
travis,
we
never
filed
any
plat
or
description
of
the
land
under
the
statute.
it's
being
our
view
for
reasons
i
shall
explain
in
a
moment
that
this
statute
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case.
we
think
that
it
--
there
are
four
objections
to
california's
view.
the
first
is
that
as
i
said
before,
no
session
is
required
under
the
constitution.
purchased
with
consent
under
article
i
and
the
authorities
i
cited,
automatically
transfers
jurisdiction
and
no
cession
by
the
states
under
the
very
language
of
united
states
against
cornell
and
later
cases
is
required.
to
that,
california
replies,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
that
section
34
of
the
political
code
which
i
have
upheld
the
consent
to
purchase,
doesn't
really
consent
to
purchase
within
the
constitutional
sense
at
all.
it
meant
consent
to
purchase
--
it
meant
simply
that
you
can
go
in
and
buy
the
land,
the
federal
government
but
we
don't
consent
you
purchasing
it
for
constitutional
purposes.
while
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
suggests
that
and
indeed
there
is
a
good
deal
that
shows
the
opposite
for
one
thing
that
the
united
states
doesn't
need
a
state's
consent
to
purchase
land
or
to
acquire
land
by
eminent
domain.
it
needs
it
to
purchase
it
and
have
the
constitution
called
into
play,
but
ever
since
cole
against
the
united
states,
it's
been
clear
that
you
don't
need
consent
just
to
get
a
proprietary
interest.
second,
the
consent
to
purchase
statute
shows
on
its
face
that
it
means
a
consent
to
purchase
which
will
operate
under
article
i,
section
8,
clause
17
of
the
constitution.
i
say
that
because
you
will
note
that
the
consent
to
purchase
statute,
i'm
now
back
at
page
99
of
the
brief
at
the
bottom,
contains
three
qualifications
or
conditions
which
would
make
no
sense
at
all
if
california
were
not
otherwise
contemplating
a
transfer
of
jurisdiction
under
the
constitution
because
of
the
consent
to
purchase.
one
condition
is
that
civil
process
issued
under
the
courts
of
the
state
and
certain
criminal
process
maybe
served
and
executed
within
the
enclave
and
now
there
would
be
no
need
to
do
that
if
california
had
reserved
all
its
jurisdiction.
equally,
the
third
condition
is
a
reservation
of
the
power
of
taxation.
there
would
be
no
need
to
do
that
if
california
supposed
that
it
is
reserving
all
its
jurisdiction.
more
fundamentally
i
think,
the
source
of
confusion
in
the
argument
for
california
and
the
reason
for
its
misconstruction
of
the
cession
statute
is
that
it
disregards
the
very
important
fact
that
there
are
two
methods
of
acquiring
land
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
that
one
method
is
dealt
with
by
the
consent
to
purchase
statute
and
the
other
method
is
dealt
with
by
the
cession
statute.
now,
let
me
explain
that
in
a
little
more
detail.
the
first,
the
consent
to
purchase
is
clear
enough
that
the
united
states
buys
as
the
consent
of
the
state
either
given
ad
hoc
or
by
a
general
statute
and
automatically
jurisdiction
passes.
the
united
states
may
also
have
title
and
possession
to
lands
within
the
territory
of
the
state
for
reasons
other
than
a
consent
to
purchase
within
the
constitutional
clause.
for
example,
in
california
as
in
many
other
western
states,
the
large
areas
of
retained
lands
that
never
passed
to
the
state
so
far
as
the
proprietary
ownership
is
concerned
and
many
of
those
were
set
apart
as
reservations.
two
excellent
illustrations
are
the
presidio
in
san
francisco
at
golden
gate
and
fort
leavenworth
in
kansas.
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
united
states
have
the
proprietary
interest
but
it
didn't
acquire
it
by
purchasing
it
with
the
consent
of
the
state
because
it
always
had
it.
another
illustration
would
be
a
purchase
of
land
without
the
consent
of
the
state
where
you
might
have
the
title
and
possession
but
not
jurisdiction.
and
a
third
illustration
would
be
an
acquisition
of
land
for
a
purpose
other
than
one
listed
in
clause
17.
for
example,
an
acquisition
of
land
for
forest
purposes
as
one
of
the
arkansas
cases
cited
in
the
brief.
in
all
these
instances,
exclusive
jurisdiction
would
not
pass
automatically
to
the
united
states
and
if
the
united
states
was
to
get
exclusive
jurisdiction,
it
would
have
to
do
it
in
some
other
method.
back
to
fort
leavenworth
railroad
against
lowe
which
was
decided
in
the
1880s,
the
supreme
court
then
held
in
an
opinion
by
justice
field
that
in
the
types
of
cases
i've
mentioned
where
clause
17
was
not
applicable,
the
united
states
might
get
exclusive
jurisdiction
by
a
cession
from
the
state.
and
indeed,
the
state
of
kansas
had
ceded
fort
leavenworth,
jurisdiction
over
fort
leavenworth
to
the
federal
government
and
in
another
instance,
the
state
of
california
ceded
jurisdiction
over
the
presidio
in
san
francisco
to
the
united
states.
so
that
there
came
to
be
a
second
method
by
which
the
untied
states
might
obtain
exclusive
jurisdiction.
we
think
it
entirely
planned
that
the
act
of
1897,
the
one
on
which
california
relies
and
the
one
that
begins
at
the
bottom
of
page
98
of
my
brief
is
a
statute
that
deals
with
the
session
of
jurisdiction
where
the
united
states
had
acquired
proprietary
interest,
but
the
consent
to
purchase
statute
was
inapplicable.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
section
34
of
the
political
code,
the
one
beginning
at
page
--
at
the
bottom
of
page
90
of
our
brief,
is
the
one
that
deals
with
consent
to
purchase
and
it
is
the
one
that
is
applicable
here
because
this
was
a
purchase
with
the
consent
of
california
under
that
statute.
now,
the
later
california
statute
of
1939
which
is
set
forth
beginning
--
it's
really
the
second
paragraph
of
section
34
of
the
political
code,
the
one
i
referred
to,
running
over
on
page
100.
it
seems
to
us
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
at
the
time
that
was
written,
california
draftsmen
realized
that
there
were
these
two
methods
by
which
the
united
states
might
acquire
exclusive
jurisdiction,
only
one
of
which
required
this
plat.
the
second
par
--
the
first
paragraph
you'll
note,
speaks
of
the
consent
to
the
purchase
and
reserves
certain
limited
jurisdiction
thereby
implying
that
the
united
states
gets
the
rest.
the
second
paragraph
says
the
authority
deserves
civil
and
criminal
process
and
the
tax
here
and
above
reserve
the
state.
in
the
case
of
the
purchase
or
condemnation
by
the
united
states
of
any
tract
of
land
within
this
jurisdiction
shall
to
any
law
contrary
notwithstanding
also
be
reserved
to
the
state
with
respect
to
any
tract
of
land
over
which
any
jurisdiction
is
ceded
or
granted
by
the
state
of
the
united
states.
there,
within
the
very
statute
that
we
think
is
controlling
is
a
reference
to
there
being
another
method
of
ceding
jurisdiction
in
cases
that
don't
come
under
the
first
paragraph.
i
should
point
out
finally
that
the
attorney
general
of
california
did
himself
recognize
in
23
opinions
of
the
attorney
general
of
california
at
page
14
that
there
are
these
two
methods
by
which
the
united
states
may
acquire
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
that
the
consent
to
purchase
statute
deals
with
one
and
is
governing
in
that
case
and
that
the
session
statute
which
alone
requires
the
requirement
of
the
filing
of
the
plat
is
--
deals
only
with
the
second
method
sessions
and
has
no
application
where
there
is
a
consent
to
purchase.
once
this
essential
distinction
is
understood,
many
of
the
points
made
by
the
petitioner
in
his
brief
become
clarified
and
dropped
by
the
wayside.
for
example,
he
quotes
at
some
length
from
the
case
of
wilson
against
cook,
a
case
dealing
with
forest
lands
in
arkansas
where
the
question
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
was
raised
and
he
quotes
language
saying
that
since
there
was
no
cession
by
the
state,
the
united
states
didn't
get
exclusive
jurisdiction.
well,
that's
quite
true.
the
consent
to
purchase
procedure
obviously
wasn't
applicable
there.
they
were
talking
about
forest
lands
and
the
consent
to
purchase
procedure
could
possibly
come
into
play.
similarly
the
references
to
the
acts
of
submitting
hawaii
and
alaska,
where
some
exclusive
jurisdiction
was
expressly
retained
by
the
congress
over
military
installations.
well,
the
reason
is
of
course
the
consent
to
purchase
statute
wouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it
because
this
wasn't
land
purchased
by
the
united
states.
and
if
you're
going
to
keep
exclusive
jurisdiction,
it
has
to
be
arranged
when
the
states
were
admitted.
now,
i
mentioned
the
final
point
earlier,
since
1940,
the
federal
statutes
have
provided
that
a
consent
to
purchase
shall
not
automatically
transfer
jurisdiction
unless
the
head
of
the
department,
in
this
case,
the
secretary
of
war
or
later
the
secretary
of
defense
signifies
his
assent
to
the
passing
of
jurisdiction,
but
this
was
done
in
letters
to
governor
warren
in
1943
and
1944,
referring
to
this
land
at
travis
air
force
base
so
that
final
step
was
accomplished
and
indeed
accomplished
within
a
very
short
space
after
the
land
in
question
was
purchased.
the
situation
with
respect
to
oakland,
i'm
now
done
with
the
general
part
of
the
argument
and
i
am
done
also
with
the
legal
details,
the
situation
with
respect
of
them
requires
a
very
brief
mention.
the
district
court's
opinion
at
page
563
speaks
of
the
federal
government
acquiring
the
land
on
which
the
milk
was
purchased
in
1950.
that's
an
error
and
an
error
for
which
i
regret
to
say
the
department
of
justice
was
clearly
responsible
because
it
was
stated
in
the
brief.
the
land
was
purchased,
the
land
on
which
the
milk
was
purchased
was
acquired
considerably
earlier
than
that,
plot
b210
which
is
the
area
in
question,
was
purchased
on
march
2,
1942
and
all
the
argument
that
i've
just
gone
through
with
respect
to
travis
is
precisely
applicable
to
it.
it
is
also
true
that
apparently,
we
went
through
the
process
of
getting
exclusive
jurisdiction
again
under
the
cession
statute
and
that's
what
the
district
court
refers
to
in
its
opinion.
the
land
at
castle
is
governed
by
exactly
the
same
principles.
i
should
mention
just
one
little
point
with
respect
to
it.
the
land
at
castle
on
which
the
milk
is
purchased
first
came
into
the
possession
of
the
united
states
under
the
lanham
act
dealing
with
housing.
i
say
into
the
possession
because
it
was
not
purchased
at
that
time.
it
came
into
possession
of
the
administrator
under
the
housing
administrator
under
the
lanham
act.
later,
the
possession
was
turned
over
to
the
secretary
of
war
and
while
it
was
in
the
possession
of
the
secretary
of
war,
the
united
states
bought
it
from
private
owners.
the
argument
is
made
by
california
that
because
section
10
of
the
lanham
act
provides
that
the
acquisition
of
the
administrator
of
any
real
property
purchased
pursuant
to
this
act
shall
not
deprive
any
state
of
its
civil
or
criminal
jurisdiction
that
this
could
i
suppose
he
says,
the
covenant
running
with
the
land
on
this
piece
of
land
and
it
never
attached
into
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
i
think
it's
enough
to
state
the
argument
surely
it
kind
of
contemplated
that
if
the
land
were
later
bought
from
private
owners
by
the
secretary
of
war
that
it
would
still
have
this
burden
attached
to
it.
and
therefore,
we
think
castle
is
governed
by
the
same
rule.
it
follows
if
my
argument
is
sound
that
the
united
states
did
gain
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
territory
within
which
these
purchases
were
made
and
conversely
that
california
had
no
power
to
apply
her
milk
control
law
to
the
transactions
within
the
enclave.
california
does
argue
that
well,
the
constitution
although
it
says
the
united
states
shall
have
the
power
of
exclusive
legislation,
it
doesn't
really
mean
that.
i
think
it's
enough
to
say
that
that
contention
as
at
adds
with
150
years
of
constitutional
history
in
a
mass
of
decisions
by
this
court,
by
lower
state
courts,
opinions
of
attorneys
general,
all,
clearly
holding
that
the
constitution
is
self-operative
in
this
respect.
and
they
--
by
the
court
--
this
court
has
excluded
state
tax
powers,
it's
excluded
state
criminal
laws
and
other
kinds
of
state
regulations.
i
just
don't
know
at
any
point
that
this
is
well
settled.
now
california's
other
argument
with
respect
to
the
territorial
jurisdiction
is
that
somehow
the
california
statute
was
assimilated
in
the
federal
law.
the
two
ways,
in
which
i
could
dream
of
that
this
might
happen.
there
is
a
1948
federal
statute,
18
u.s.
code
section
13,
the
effect
of
which
is
to
make
law
within
a
federal
enclave,
any
state
criminal
law
which
is
within
effect
in
the
state
at
the
time
the
crime
is
committed.
this
isn't
like
the
old
assimilative
crimes
act
that
applied
only
as
of
the
time
the
jurisdiction
was
taken
of
it.
this
applies
to
current
criminal
law.
california
as
i
understand
doesn't
rely
on
that
statute
if
i'll
mention
it
just
for
clarity
for
i
take
it,
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place
even
if
those
--
even
if
this
law
were
assimilated
it
becomes
a
federal
crime.
it's
not
something
that
california
authorities
are
charged
with
prosecuting
or
that
the
california
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
deal
with.
second,
it
seems
to
me
although
i
can't
support
any
--
cite
any
cases
for
the
proposition
that
the
assimilative
crimes
act
was
not
intended
to
take
over
a
whole
regulatory
measure
resting
on
state
administrative
action
adherent
are
quite
different
from
the
normal
type
of
criminal
offense,
the
things
included
in
the
criminal
code.
the
remaining
argument
with
respect
to
territorial
jurisdiction
is
that
well,
even
if
we
don't
apply
our
state
milk
control
law
to
the
purchases
within
the
enclave,
still
there
is
a
provision
of
california
law
which
prohibits
anyone
to
process
or
handle
milk
which
he
is
going
to
sell
at
a
price
below
the
california
price.
and
as
i
understand
mr.
fourt
in
his
brief,
he
is
saying,
“well,
we
can
enforce
that
section
anyway.”
our
answer
--
mr.
archibald
cox
against
the
handlers.
mr.
archibald
cox
our
answer
to
that
is
that
this
is
the
very
contention
that
was
made
in
the
pacific
coast
dairy
case
and
the
very
contention
that
was
explicitly
answered
by
justice
roberts
in
his
opinion
in
that
case.
i
don't
want
to
take
time
to
read
the
paragraph
but
he
deals
with
it
very
expressively.
and
certainly,
nothing
in
that
case
makes
the
result
turn
on
what
happened
to
the
milk
after
the
federal
government
got
it.
what
it
turns
on
is
that
you
can't
put
it
in
simple
terms.
you
can't
say
that
no
one
shall
walk
on
the
highways
of
california
who
is
going
to
permit
what
california
doesn't
want
them
to
do
on
the
federal
enclave
where
it's
perfectly
lawful
for
them
to
do
it.
i
point
that
i
think
clear
beyond
dispute.
now,
turning
to
the
second
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
penn
dairies
remains
untouched
given
my
argument
on
the
point
i've
just
made
because
penn
dairies
did
not
involve
any
question
of
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction.
we
would
have
in
effect
a
reaffirmation
of
the
pacific
coast
dairies
case
which
was
decided
on
the
same
day
as
penn
dairies.
we
say
that
in
this
case,
the
pacific
coast
dairies,
and
this
disposes
the
matter.
now
with
respect
to
my
other
points,
i
have
to
deal
in
somewhat
more
detail
with
the
penn
dairies
case.
our
second
main
point
is
that
the
california
milk
control
law
is
inconsistent
with
the
federal
procurement
statute
in
regulation
and
therefore
must
deal
under
the
supremacy
clause.
this
was
pointed
out
earlier
that
the
district
court
sustained
this
contention
on
the
authority
of
the
california
public
utilities
commission
case.
we
think
it
was
plainly
right
in
upholding
that
contention.
the
federal
scheme
embodied
in
the
statute
and
regulations
as
i
shall
show
directs
the
procurement
officers
to
purchase
at
the
lowest
overall
cost
to
the
united
states
usually
through
competitive
bidding
on
advertised
request
for
bids,
but
if
by
negotiation
then
still
in
a
process
of
negotiation,
it
brings
back
all
of
the
competitive
forces
that
will
make
sure
that
the
united
states
receives
the
lowest
possible
price.
in
this
instance,
the
lowest
possible
price
permitted
in
the
way
of
markup
over
the
minimum
prices
required
to
be
paid
to
california
milk
producers.
the
california
law
obviously
would
eliminate
that
kind
of
competition
which
the
federal
statute
contemplates
and
therefore
we
say,
that
we
too
are
inconsistent
and
that
the
california
law
must
yield.
the
point
was
squarely
adjudicated
in
public
utilities
commission
of
california
against
the
united
states
and
we
think
the
case
is
controlling
here.
in
each
instance,
the
case
arose
under
the
armed
services
procurement
act
of
1947.
the
regulations
are
somewhat
different
because
one
dealt
with
the
procurement
of
commodities,
the
other
with
transportation,
but
their
thrust
is
indistinguishable.
the
california
milk
control
law
leaves
even
less
scope
for
competition
or
negotiation,
but
in
the
state
clause
you'll
remember
in
the
public
utilities
commission
case
under
which
california
utilities
commission
could
permit
negotiations,
there
is
none
here
so
the
inconsistency
is
even
greater.
the
governing
statutes
are
set
out
--
and
regulations
are
set
out
in
our
brief
beginning
at
page
104
for
the
statutes
and
then
the
regulations
continue
over
on
page
106
and
107.
i'll
deal
with
those
in
the
morning.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
rose
yesterday,
i
was
just
beginning
to
develop
the
second
of
the
three
grounds
on
which
we
contend
that
these
purchases
were
immune
from
california
regulation.
that
ground
your
honor's
will
recall
as
the
california
milk
control
law
is
inconsistent
with
the
federal
procurement
statutes
and
regulations
and
therefore
must
yield
under
the
supremacy
clause.
federal
scheme
as
we
read
the
statute
and
the
regulations
directs
the
procurement
officers
to
acquire
goods
by
a
competitive
bidding
were
possible
and
whereby
negotiation,
nevertheless,
with
enough
negotiators
to
acquire
the
benefits
of
competition.
in
that
view,
i
think
appears
quite
clearly
from
a
review
of
the
statute
and
also,
particularly
the
regulations
that
are
set
forth
in
the
appendices
to
our
brief.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
the
regulations
deal
with
the
purchases
of
the
government
and
not
with
the
purchases
of
the
private
handlers
from
the
farmers.
we're
concerned
as
i
sought
--
show
yesterday,
we're
getting
the
benefits
of
competition
at
the
handler
level.
now,
we're
not
concerned
with
getting
the
benefits
of
competition
at
the
producer
level
quite
contrary.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
i
would
have
an
exceedingly
difficult
case
and
i
think
in
view
in
the
interpretation
put
on
the
regulations
by
the
secretary
of
defense.
at
the
present
time,
i
would
have
a
virtually
impossible
case
because
i
should
suppose
that
that
interpretation
by
which
is
very
firmly
the
view
of
the
defense
department
at
this
time.
it's
been
reported
to
congress,
should
be
read
as
a
rubric.
but
this
regulations
deal
with
our
purchasers
from
the
distributors
where
we
frankly
do
seek
to
get
the
benefits
of
competition
so
far
as
that
margin
is
concerned.
i
might
say
in
that
connection
it
was
mentioned
yesterday
that
united
states'
attorneys
were
in
the
california's
courts
seeking
to
aid
the
cause
of
the
handlers
with
respect
to
the
enforcement
of
producer
price.
i've
been
able
to
find
no
evidence
if
that's
so
if
theirs
some
misunderstanding
here.
i
certainly
going
to
assure
the
california
authorities
that
there's
no
doubt
in
washington
about
what
our
policy
is.
and
we'll
take
steps
to
transmit
those
instructions
if
there
had
been
any
confusion.
a
question
was
raised
in
the
reply
brief
about
the
procurement
regulations.
the
reply
brief
states
that
the
government
purports
to
quote
them
but
the
counsel
was
unable
to
find
them
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations.
the
source
of
the
confusion
is
that
what
we
print
in
the
back
of
the
brief
is
the
regulations
as
they
appear
in
the
record
and
those
were
the
regulations
enforced
at
the
time
the
suit
was
brought.
subsequently,
there
was
a
minor
change
made
which
involves
some
renumbering
and
the
result
is
that
unless
you
check
through
the
numbers
three
--
301
became
302
or
303
and
things
like
that.
it
is
confusing
but
these
regulations
were
the
once
in
effect
at
the
time
and
indeed
the
ones
effect
the
day
also
the
numbers
are
different,
are
substantially
the
same.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
its
--
its
certainly
helpful
to
my
case
and
we
think
that
the
same
two
differences
that
were
pointed
out
in
the
public
utilities
case
still
exist
today.
at
the
time
of
the
penn
dairies
case,
the
old
version
of
the
regulation
said
that
appropriated
funds
might
not
be
used
for
payments
upon
awards,
upon
invitations
for
bids
containing
requirement
showing
compliance
to
the
state
price
laws.
at
least
not
until
there'd
been
a
final
and
authoritative
determination
that
the
state's
statutes
are
applicable.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
has
been
--
excuse
me.
that's
been
released.
then
another
difference
was
that
the
old
version
of
the
regulations
had
declared
that
competitive
bids
were
not
required
when
the
price
is
fixed
by
federal,
state,
municipal
or
other
competent
legal
authority.
that
too
has
been
taken
out.
these
differences
were
thought
precisely
by
the
court
in
the
california
commission
case.
the
same
differences
exist
today
and
we
think
that
the
california
commission
case
therefore
rather
than
the
earlier
case
is
controlling.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'm
--
but,
yes
clearly.
now,
i
don't
see
that
there
is
any
essential
difference
between
milk
and
transportation
in
this
respect.
i
don't
think
there's
any
difference
between
kinds
of
transportation
in
this
respect.
if
we
are
talking
about
the
policy
and
the
procurement
regulation,
the
same
policy
is
laid
down
by
the
regulations
in
each
case
and
it
draws
no
difference
between
milk
and
transportation.
indeed
if
there
is
any,
it's
that
the
policy
expressed
than
the
regulation
is
applicable
to
the
procurement
of
commodity
is
more
emphatic
and
clearer
than
the
policy
declared
in
relation
to
transportation.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it
might
be
relevant
but
hardly
decisive
because
the
question
that
certainly
congress
has
done
nothing
it
would
seem
to
give
its
consent
to
california
to
apply
california
legislation
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
in
the
federal
enclave.
and
i
think
this
section
saying,
nobody
shall
prepare
to
do
anything
unlawful
in
the
enclave
is
equivalent
as
the
court
said
in
the
pacific
coast
dairy
case
to
--
attempting
to
regulate
what
happens
in
the
enclave.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
if
this
happened
in
the
federal
enclave
over
which
there
was
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
that
california
could
not
take
action
that
this
would
be
a
matter
punishable
or
by
reprimand
or
if
it's
an
offense
by
an
information
or
indictment
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
still
not
the
decision
of
legislative
jurisdiction
to
california.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
my
first
ground
is
good
i
think
california
no
longer
could
--
i
think
california
could
not
intervene.
of
course
if
they
had
given
consent
and
expressed
the
policy
of
complying
with
state
price
control
laws,
then
my
second
ground
would
be
gone.
but
it
seems
to
make
quite
clear
that
congress
did
not
give
the
consent
and
that
the
statute
and
especially
the
regulations
expressly
opposing
view.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
statute
is
applicable
to
purchases
with
appropriated
funds.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
the
basis
on
which
we
rest.
so
that
really
there
are
three
kinds
of
milk
involved
here
in
all
candor.
but
firstly,
the
purchases
were
(inaudible)
branches
then
as
to
that
my
case
stands
just
as
i
have
stated.
at
the
other
extreme
are
the
purchases
of
officers'
clubs,
and
other
activities
at
that
time
which
remained
from
a
revolving
funds
and
not
about
of
appropriated
funds
and
as
to
those,
i
don't
think
we
can
fairly
argue
that
the
procurement
policy
is
applicable.
in
between
our
certain
purchases
made
for
commissaries,
purchases
for
resale.
now
as
to
those,
i
think
my
argument
on
the
procurement
policy
is
somewhat
weaker
and
still
think
it's
a
valid
argument
but
there
are
two
points
which
can
be
made
against
them.
one
is
that
congress
has
indicated
that
where
things
are
bought
for
resale,
it
is
not
--
is
concerned
with
competitive
bidding.
now
second,
it
has
indicated
that
a
commissary
should
not
be
established
in
areas
where
goods
can
be
purchased
at
local
stores
nearby
for
the
same
prices.
now
mr.
ford
argues,
i
think
with
some
parts
that
this
indicates
that
--
or
may
indicate,
that
the
milk
bought
for
the
commissaries,
congress
wasn't
so
interested
in
competitive
price.
my
reply
is
that
the
same
regulations
