justice
potter
stewart
is
it
clear
as
a
matter
settled
law
that
transfer
of
venue
of
that
nature,
that
the
--
that
the
statute
of
limitations
of
the
transferring
court
is
not
the
applicable
one?
justice
potter
stewart
i
remember
about
ten
--
more
than
ten
years
ago,
while
i
was
in
the
practice,
i
--
i
had
some
litigation
involving
that
question.
at
that
time,
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
clear.
justice
potter
stewart
surely.
justice
potter
stewart
the
state
has
borders
to
this.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
a
--
what
was
being
unloaded
here
was
--
was
entirely
a
cargo
of
beans.
justice
potter
stewart
on
pallets
--
it
was
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
we
should
decide
what
specifically?
the
unseaworthiness
liability
to
some
--
to
a
shoreside
worker
who's
working
on
the
shore
and
who's
injured
ashore,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
who
--
since
when
a
seaman
traditionally
performed
this
work,
it's
always
been
a
worker,
a
shoreside
employee,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
reporting
to
somewhere
in
your
brief,
were
you?
justice
potter
stewart
who
is
the
--
to
whom
did
the
unloading
tackle,
was
it
a
part
of
ship's
gear?
justice
potter
stewart
or
was
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
injury
was
on
the
vessel.
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
ship's
tackle
broke
or
was
it
defected?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers
act
extend
to
puerto
rico?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not.
justice
potter
stewart
compensation
act.
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
purport
to
make
the
remedy
exclusive
as
against
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
against
the
employer.
justice
potter
stewart
does
it
explicitly
permit
suits
in
third
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
thank
you,
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
it
will
depend
upon
who
the
man
was,
wasn't
it,
so
far
--
insofar
as
unseaworthiness
liability.
if
you
were
just
--
if
you
were
--
if
you
were
a
casual
stranger
who
is
walking
along
there,
you
wouldn't
be
within
the
scope
of
the
unseaworthiness
liability,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
assuming
[inaudible]
--
assuming
this
plaintiff.
justice
potter
stewart
your
point
is
that
somebody
on
the
dock
simply
couldn't
see
the
condition
of
the
bags
as
they
came
out
of
the
hold.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that's
the
difference
it
makes.
it's
just
a
matter
of
physical
impossibility
to
be
seen.
