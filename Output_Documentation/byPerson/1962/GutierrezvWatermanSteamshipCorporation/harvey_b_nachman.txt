mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
of
a
longshoreman
who
is
injured
on
october
21,
1956
when
he
fell
on
the
pier
of
the
dock
area.
he
was
engaged
in
the
discharging
of
cargo
from
a
particular
vessel
and
beans
had
become
scattered
about
the
pier
surface
in
the
discharge
operation
from
bags
that
had
been
broken
aboard
the
vessel.
he
filed
his
libel
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
january
9,
1959
and
pleaded
excusable
delay
in
the
absence
of
prejudice
to
the
respondent.
the
case
was
then
transferred
to
puerto
rico,
to
the
district
court
of
puerto
rico,
and
the
respondent
answered
the
libel
stating
that,
in
its
affirmative
defenses,
that
the
action
was
barred
by
laches.
the
respondent
then
submitted
interrogatories
in
which
they
asked
the
names
of
all
the
eyewitnesses
which
were
furnished
to
the
respondent.
deposition
of
the
libellant
was
taken
and
in
march
1960,
the
case
came
on
for
trial.
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
the
trial
judge
rendered
a
--
an
oral
opinion
from
the
bench
in
which
he
stated
that
the
only
issue
he
wanted
briefed
was
the
question
of
medical
damages,
that
he
was
satisfied,
that
there
was
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner,
that
the
vessel
was
unseaworthy,
and
that
both
of
these
were
the
proximate
causes
of
the
injury,
and
that
there
was
no
laches
because
the
respondent
was
not
prejudiced.
thereafter,
the
trial
court
rendered
a
memorandum
opinion
and
formal
findings
of
fact.
if
i
may
allude
to
these
findings
of
fact,
they
are
on
pages
18
and
19
of
the
record.
the
trial
court
found
that
many
bags
aboard
the
vessels
were
defective
and
broken,
that
despite
the
work
of
coopers,
beans
had
been
observed
spilling
from
drafts
as
they
were
being
unloaded
from
the
vessel,
and
that
the
beans
scattered
about
the
pier
created
a
dangerous
condition.
it
went
on
to
find
that
the
cargo
was
defective
and
unseaworthy
and
that
the
shipowner
was
negligent
in
permitting
the
discharge
when
it
knew
or
should
have
known
that
the
in
--
that
injury,
not
the
injured,
but
injury
was
likely
to
occur
to
people
who
were
performing
services
on
behalf
of
the
vessel.
it
went
on
to
find
that
these
were
the
proximate
causes,
and
it
also
found
that
as
to
laches,
all
of
the
eyewitnesses
were
available.
the
potential
eyewitnesses
were
known
to
the
respondent.
that
all
the
documentary
evidence
relating
to
the
voyage,
the
occurrence,
the
injury,
and
the
medical
treatment
were
available
to
the
respondent,
and
in
fact
all
of
this
documentary
evidence
was
in
fact
produced
at
the
trial
by
the
respondent.
the
court
concluded
that
it
has
jurisdiction
and
awarded
damages
in
the
sum
of
$18,250.
the
respondent
appealed
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
reversed
and
found
that
there
was
no
unseaworthiness,
that
there
was
no
negligence,
and
that
the
libellant
was
barred
by
laches.
we
have
petitioned
for
certiorari
stating
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
contrary
to
the
decision
of
the
courts
of
appeals
of
all
the
other
circuits
that
have
passed
upon
the
questions
herein.
and
a
certiorari
was
granted
in
october
and
the
first
question
i
think
we
face
is
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
to
reverse
or
to
make
findings
of
fact
of
its
own.
the
trial
judge
had
before
him
the
petitioner
and
all
the
eyewitnesses,
and
their
demeanor
and
their
credibility
were
for
him
to
judge.
he
was
a
--
in
a
peculiarly
excellent
position
as
a
trial
judge
to
gauge
their
credibility
and
demeanor,
and
that
they
all
testified
in
spanish,
and
the
trial
judge
was
fluent
in
spanish.
there
was
some
conflicting
evidence
as
between
the
eyewitnesses
and
some
of
the
documentary
evidence
and
there
was
conflicting
evidence
between
the
various
documents
that
were
introduced
by
the
respondent.
the
weight
of
this
evidence
we
submit
was
for
the
trial
court
as
it
was
the
question
of
laches,
because
this
court
has
held
that
laches
is
addressed
to
the
sound
discretion
of
the
trial
judge.
i
must
point
out
that
there
was
no
conflict
in
the
evidence
as
to
the
occurrence
of
the
accident
or
how
it
occurred.
and
there
was
no
conflict
in
the
evidence
as
to
whether
or
not
the
bags
were
torn
aboard
the
vessel.
the
documentary
evidence
of
the
respondent
proved
that
the
vessels
were
torn
aboard
the
vessel.
the
court
of
appeals
extracted
certain
items
from
the
documentary
evidence
and
gave
them
more
weight
than
the
trial
judge
did.
it
made
inference
of
its
own,
it
even
misread
one
document,
and
on
each
disputed
issue,
it
drew
contrary
conclusions
and
contrary
inferences
than
did
the
trial
judge.
now,
we
submit
under
the
mcallister
rule
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
have
this
power.
if
i
may
go
to
the
first
issue
which
is
that
of
laches,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
interesting
in
that
it
says
that
the
libellant
or
petitioner
had
no
right
to
recover
on
the
merits.
if
it
the
petitioner
had
no
right
to
recover
on
the
merits,
why
discuss
the
question
of
laches
at
all?
because
obviously,
the
respondent
had
a
fair
trial,
if
the
petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
recover
on
the
merits,
but
they
discussed
the
question
of
laches
and
if
i
may
allude
to
the
facts
that
are
in
the
record;
the
suit
was
filed
in
new
york.
in
new
york,
the
analogous
statutes
of
limitations
are
three
years
for
negligence
and
six
years
for
unseaworthiness.
upon
transfer
to
puerto
rico,
this
action
was
filed
two
years,
two
months,
and
19
days
after
the
occurrence.
in
puerto
rico,
the
analogous
statute
is
set
forth
in
petitioner's
brief
and
it
is
as
one
year
from
the
date
of
the
final
decision
of
the
state
insurance
fund.
the
action
was
filed
13
months
after
that
date,
but
that
analogous
statute
is
only
a
yardstick.
and
the
same
court
of
appeals,
three
months
later,
held
that
to
be
barred
by
laches,
an
action
must
be
filed,
both
after
inexcusable
delay
and
prejudice
to
the
respondent.
in
this
case,
the
libellant
or
petitioner
furnished
the
respondent
with
the
names
of
all
the
witnesses.
the
respondent
chose
not
to
interview
them.
the
petitioner
--
i'm
sorry,
the
records
introduced
into
evidence
were
by
the
respondent.
they
showed
that
the
eyewitnesses
whose
names
were
submitted
in
answer
to
interrogatories
were
the
only
potential
eyewitnesses
by
their
own
payroll
records.
the
respondent's
documentary
evidence
included
an
accident
report,
reports
showing
broken
and
torn
cargo
aboard
the
vessel,
spillage
inside
the
pier
--
inside
the
vessel
and
on
the
pier,
the
fact
that
coopers
were
being
used
aboard
the
vessel
to
sew
bag
and
also
ashore
to
sew
bag
that
came
off
torn,
and
the
entire
medical
history
of
the
petitioner
from
1951
to
1960.
they
had
a
physical
examination
of
the
petitioner
and
their
doctor
--
the
record
shows
the
doctor
said
that
he
had
everything
that
the
petitioner's
doctors
said
that
he
had.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
despite
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
that
there
was
no
prejudice,
that
the
witnesses'
memory,
were
faulty
in
that,
they
also
testified
to
the
spillage
of
rice
and
rice
was
not
discharged
until
after
the
occurrence.
but
the
trial
court
never
found
that
the
libellant
or
the
petitioner
was
injured
by
falling
on
rice.
and
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
regarded
prejudice
as
in
terms
of
“can
i
win”
rather
than
“can
i
defend”
certainly
the
respondent
here
was
just
as
much
able
with
all
if
its
documentary
proof
and
all
of
its
--
and
the
availability
to
interview
the
witnesses
to
defend
two
years
after
the
occurrence
in
puerto
rico
as
it
would
have
been
six
years
after
the
occurrence
in
new
york.
this
leads
us
to
the
question
of,
“what
should
the
analogous
statute
of
limitations
be
for
laches?”
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
that's
right,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
it
was
transferred
under
rule
1404
(a).
in
mcalli
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
that
the
law
is
that
the
transferring
courts
statute
should
be
the
analogous
statute.
but
the
trial
judge
in
puerto
rico
has
assumed,
that
his
statute,
that
is
the
statute
in
puerto
rico
would
be
the
analogous
statute
and
we
raised
no
issue
as
to
that
in
this
case
at
any
time
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
we
have
it
in
--
in
the
admiralty
procedure
as
i
know
it,
for
example,
if
i
have
a
case
referred
to
me
because
the
vessel
is
seized
in
puerto
rico,
and
the
accident
occurred
in
pennsylvania,
actually
what
happens
is
that
proctor
for
the
libellant
always
tries
to
get
the
best
he
can
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
--
under
such
a
situation.
but
usually,
a
stipulation
is
entered
into
if
transfer
is
clear
under
1404
(a)
and
jurisdiction
could
have
been
obtained
under
the
hoffman
[inaudible],
that
the
statute
of
limitations
which
will
be
the
analogous
statute
will
be
the
transferring
jurisdiction.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
the
accident
did
take
place
in
ponce,
puerto
rico.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
yes,
sir.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
yes
there
is,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
but
the
delay
--
the
delay
was
occasioned
because
the
petitioner
had
hired
an
attorney
from
new
jersey.
the
--
this
attorney
left
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
this
--
this
attorney
returned
to
new
jersey
and
never
communicated
with
the
petitioner,
and
the
petitioner
contacted
us
in
july
of
1958.
we
told
him
we
could
not
represent
him
until
we
contacted
the
attorney
in
new
jersey
who
had
the
retainer.
and
that
took
sometime
and
in
january
of
1959,
we've
contacted
an
attorney
in
new
york
to
file
the
libel
for
us
there
because
waterman
steamship
corporation
at
that
time
would
not
voluntarily
appear
in
puerto
rico
without
seizure.
in
mcallister
against
magnolia,
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
his
concurring
opinion
stated
that
--
he
felt
that
to
avoid
this
form
of
shopping
that
has
just
become
evident,
a
single
analogous
statute
should
be
used
as
a
yardstick”.
that
is
the
same
statute
that
is
used
for
seamen
in
the
jones
act,
the
three-year
statute.
and
the
fifth
circuit
has
now
adopted
mr.
justice
brennan's
reasoning
for
longshoreman
as
well
and
holds
that
because
in
the
–
in
the
fifth
circuit
alone,
and
the
sixth
jurisdiction
is
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
analogous
statutes
of
limitations
has
ranged
from
one
year
in
mississippi,
four
years
in
florida,
and
in
some
cases,
six
years
in
louisiana.
and
the
fifth
circuit
has
adopted
the
reasoning
of
mr.
justice
brennan
and
said
that
we
will
use
the
three-year
statute
of
the
jones
act
because
unseaworthiness
is
the
same,
whether
it
occurs
to
a
seaman
or
to
a
longshoreman.
the
fourth
circuit
has
not
passed
on
it,
but
judge
hoffman
in
the
district
court
of
virginia
has
rejected
mr.
justice
brennan's
reasoning.
we
feel
that
there
should
be
uniformity
in
these
cases
and
that
it
should
not
depend
upon
the
fortuitous
circumstance
of
where
the
particular
longshoreman
was
injured.
for
example
in
puerto
rico,
it
depends
upon
the
length
of
treatment
that
the
injured
worker
has
as
to
what
the
analogous
statute
of
limitations
is.
in
new
york,
it
depends
which
side
of
the
river
he's
working
that
particular
day,
because
in
new
jersey
it's
a
two-year
or
a
three-year
statute,
and
in
new
york,
it's
three
and
six
for
negligence
and
unseaworthiness.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
every
state
has
borders
but
not
every
port
is
in
two
states.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
i
was
only
just
saying
new
york
because
it's
the
only
port
i
can
think
of
that's
into
two
--
in
two
states.
but
whether
the
jones
act
is
adopted
as
the
analogous
statute
by
this
court,
or
whether
this
court
adopts
no
statute
or
a
flexible
statute
or
retains
the
present
state
statute
as
the
yardstick,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
prejudice
in
this
case
to
the
respondent.
that
the
trial
court
exercise
its
discretion
based
upon
evidence
in
the
record
and
it
was
error
on
the
part
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
a
revoke
this
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
also
reversed
the
trial
court
because
it
found
that
the
judge
erred
in
finding
that
the
respondent
was
guilty
of
negligence.
the
grounds
for
reversal
are
in
its
opinion,
it
says,
“that
first
of
all
the
trial
court
erred
in
referring
to
a
bag
breaking
in
midair,
and
the
record
should
have
been
read
that
the
bag
fell
from
midair
and
broke
unto
the
pier.
this
was
a
bag
that
fell
from
hold
number
one,
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
respondent
participated
in
the
conduct
which
caused
the
spillage
on
the
dock
and
that
the
respondent
had
no
control
over
the
locus
of
where
the
injury
occurred.
now
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
that's
right.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
it
was
on
the
tackles
on
the
pallets
that
--
they
were
being
unloaded
in
pallets,
sir.
in
this
particular
hatch,
they
were
being
unloaded
--
in
these
first
three
hatches,
they
were
being
unloaded
in
pallets,
the
evidence
--
the
respondent's
record
show
that
from
hatches
number
four
and
five,
they
were
being
unloaded
in
canvas
slings
attached
to
the
tackle.
even
if
we
concede
that
the
trial
court
read
this
ambiguous
document
incorrectly,
let
us
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
reading
of
this
document
is
correct.
i
don't
know
how
we
can
disregard
the
trial
courts'
findings
that
there
was
broken
cargo
aboard
the
ship,
that
there
was
constant
observance
of
the
spillage
from
the
ship
while
it
was
attached
to
the
ships'
tackle
to
the
pier,
that
it
was
foreseeable
that
if
this
cargo
were
discharged,
that
somebody
in
the
service
of
the
ship
would
become
injured,
and
that
these
beans
actually
spilled
because
of
this
negligence,
and
that
the
proximate
cause
of
the
libellant's
injury
was
the
beans
on
the
pier.
these
findings
also
negate
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
respondent
did
not
participate
in
any
way
in
this
conduct.
the
respondent
continued
to
discharge
these
bags
when
it
knew
or
should
have
known
of
their
condition,
that's
four
coopers
in
--
on
this
ship,
sewing
these
bags
up,
and
the
foreseeable
consequences
thereof.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
well,
from
the
evidence,
it
seems
that
the
bags
themselves
were
poor
because
many
of
them
disintegrated,
some
were
--
from
the
record,
it
seems
that
there
was
pilferage
because
of
holes,
not
in
the
bags
of
beans,
but
there
were
pilferages
from
cartons
in
respondent's
exhibit
10,
which
is
in
the
record,
that
there
was
a
lot
of
pilferages
in
cartons
because
the
cargo
was
all
broken
especially
in
pier
–
in
holds
number
four.
and
then
there
was
spillage
at
the
aft
end
of
the
ship
because
the
cargo
boom
dropped
the
whole
draft
loads
of
cargo
when
it
couldn't
clear
trucks
that
were
stationed
on
the
deck
of
the
vessel.
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
occurrence
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
--
which
happened
to
be
the
forward
side
of
the
vessel.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
at
the
time
--
well,
at
the
time
prior
to
this
occurrence
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
on
pallets.
the
argument
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
negligence
cannot
be
found
against
the
respondent
because
the
respondent
had
no
control
over
the
place
where
the
accident
occurred
is
to
me
a
novel
statement
of
tort
law.
if
i
cause
debris
of
any
kind,
to
become
--
or
to
be
placed
on
my
neighbor's
property,
can
i
be
absolved
from
consequent
injury
to
anyone
who
walks
on
that
property
because
i
don't
control
that
property,
and
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
here.
that
despite
the
findings
of
the
trial
judge,
since
the
ship
did
not
control
the
pier,
it
cannot
be
held
liable
for
any
negligent
conduct
in
discharging
this
because
it
did
not
control
the
pier.
we
submit
that
even
if
this
court
were
to
decide
that
the
seaworthiness
doctrine
does
not
extend
to
the
pier,
which
i
will
come
to
immediately,
that
this
particular
case
should
be
reversed
and
the
trial
judge,
this
is
a
judgment
reinstated,
decree
reinstated
because
of
the
findings
of
negligence
and
these
findings
are
sufficient
in
and
of
themselves
to
warrant
recovery.
we
come
to
the
crucial
issue
--legal
issue
i
think
which
is,
does
the
doctrine
of
seaworthiness
extend
to
the
pier
area.
this
court
in
the
sieracki
case
left
that
question
open,
specifically
left
it
open
in
a
footnote.
and
just
six
years
later,
mr.
--
excuse
me,
judge
learned
hand
decided
that
the
question
should
be
answered
in
the
affirmative
in
the
strika
against
netherlands
ministry
of
traffic
case
in
the
second
circuit.
since
that,
well
--
excuse
me,
certiorari
was
denied
in
that
case
despite
the
fact
that
judge
swan
dissented
not
on
grounds
that
he
differed
with
judge
hand,
but
that
he
felt
that
this
court
should
decide
the
issue.
but
this
court
denied
certiorari
and
i'm
not
implying
that
by
that,
you'll
have
affirmed
the
strika
case,
but
the
bench
in
the
bar,
all
over
the
united
states
has,
i
will
submit,
concluded
that
you
have
affirmed
the
strika
case
because
in
every
case
in
the
last
11
years
in
which
this
issue
has
arisen,
there
has
been
recovery
when
there
has
been
the
finding
of
negligence
or
unseaworthiness
until
the
case
below.
and
this
includes
the
fourth
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
in
this
particular
case
no,
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
think
that
this
issue
is
apparent
and
comes
up
frequently.
there's
a
case
now
pending
in
the
third
circuit
that
is
awaiting
decision
of
the
court
--
of
this
court
in
this
case,
and
there
are
cases
arising
all
the
time.
and
because
of
the
extreme
conflict
between
the
view
of
the
first
circuit
and
the
other
five
circuits
that
have
viewed
this
case,
i
think
that
you
should
--
that
this
court
should
decide
it
because
otherwise
there
would
be
hopeless
confusion
in
the
admiralty
law.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
not
to
any
shoreside
worker,
mr.
justice
stewart,
to
a
shoreside
worker
who
has
the
same
status
as
a
seaman
or
who
is
doing
the
work
that
traditionally
performed
by
a
seaman.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
in
my
brief,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
have
pointed
out
that
since
time
immemorial,
the
seamen
were
charged
with
the
duty
of
both
loading
and
discharging
the
vessel.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
mr.
justice
goldberg,
we
have
a
peculiar
situation
in
puerto
rico
and
that
there
are
some
companies
in
which
the
seamen
do
load
and
unload
the
cargo.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
they
don't
have
union
---
all
the
steamship
companies
that
operate
in
puerto
rico
are
not
unionized.
but--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
it
was
only
in
recent
times,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
at
footnote
6
on
page
10,
all
of
these
cases
cited
in
footnote
6
were
cases
involving
seamen
loading
and
unloading
cargo.
seaman
--
there
are
admiralty
cases
where
seaman
had
been
rightfully
--
where
wages
had
been
rightfully
withheld
from
seamen
for
their
failure
to
load
cargo
or
for
their
leaving
the
vessel
before
the
cargo
was
unloaded.
there
has
never
been
any
question
that
this
man
--
this
man
is
better
than
the
man
working
in
the
shed.
this
is
the
person
who
is
a
tacker
man.
he
was
disengaging
the
draft
from
the
hook
while
it
was
still
attached
to
the
vessel.
this
vessel
could
no
more
unload
without
him
than
it
could
without
the
persons
who
are
loading
the
drafts
in
the
hold.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
well
the
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
well,
the
booms,
the
winches,
the
winch
hooks
all
belong
to
the
ship
--
ship's
gear.
the
pallets
are
usually
the
property
of
the
longshore
--
of
the
stevedoring
contractor.
in
this
case,
it's
very
difficult
to
tell
it.
it
was
never
an
issue
in
evidence
because
the
stevedoring
contractor
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
steamship
company,
so
that
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
it
and
it
was
never
raised
as
an
issue
on
this
either.
unseaworthiness
is
defined
by
this
court
in
sieracki
as
a
form
of
absolute
duty
owed
--
owing
to
all
within
the
range
of
the
humanitarian
policy.
now,
the
petitioner
is
a
member
of
the
class
performing
the
work
traditionally
done
by
seamen,
but
the
court
of
appeals
would
cut
him
out
from
the
protection
on
the
ground
that
he
was
not
even
in
a
technical
sense
about
to
go
on
a
voyage.
i
submit
that
if
you
adopt
this
position,
you
have
overruled
sieracki
because
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
had
indicated,
there
is
no
longshoreman
who
is
in
any
sense
today
about
to
go
on
a
voyage.
there's
no
difference
in
service
performed
by
this
man
than
the
man
aboard
the
vessel
and
all
the
other
courts
have
dismissed
this
argument
as
being
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
the
court
of
appeals
has
also
said
that
the
condition
of
the
cargo
should
not
render
the
vessel
unseaworthy
and
the
brief
has
cited
all
the
cases
where
condition
of
the
cargo
per
se
can
render
a
vessel
unseaworthy
including
improper
stowage,
weak
containers,
containers
that
can't
support
weight,
and
the
valerio
case
which
was
decided
in
1952
which
is
almost
an
all
force
for
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
it
was
on
the
vessel.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
and
the
injury
was
on
the
vessel.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
but
in
these
cases
cited
on
page
14
of
petitioner's
brief
and
others,
they
were
ashore,
reboff
was
ashore
and
that
was
a
combination
of
ship's
equipment
and
cargo,
valerio
was
ashore
and
it
was
cargo,
litwin
was
ashore
and
it
wasn't
eve
--
it
was
neither
cargo
nor
ship's
equipment,
it
was
stevedore's
equipment.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
yes,
because
the
--
it
was
--
you
--
being
use
to
load
--
it
was
a
baltimore
dog,
i
think
it's
both
been
used
to
load
beams
from
a
railroad
car
onto
the
winches,
onto
the
ship's
tackle
in
order
to
put
it
aboard
the
vessel.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
the
baltimore
dog
broke.
the
court
says,
that
is
the
court
of
appeals
says,
that
it
will
not
cross
the
gangway
because
of
the
awesome
obligations.
i
can
see
that
these
obligations
of
non-delegable
duty
and
of
liability
without
fault
maybe
awesome,
but
the
--
they
are
prompted
by
the
humanitarian
consideration
that
the
injury
suffered
by
innocent
victim
is
an
awesome
burden
to
sustain.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
no.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
no
sir.
we
have
the
local
workmen's
compensation
act
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
--
of
puerto
rico.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
as
against
the
employer.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
just
as
he
does
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
yes
sir,
that's
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
--
that's
in
--
the
statute
is
included
in
our
brief.
it's
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
no,
no.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
no,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
if
the
longshoreman
is
struck
by
a
tractor
driven
by
another
longshoreman,
he
cannot
sue
the
vessel
as
being
unseaworthy,
nor
can
he
sue
the
vessel
owner
for
negligence,
or
if
he
is
injured
as
a
result
of
the
negligence
or
the
failure
of
his
employer
to
provide
something
that
he
must
provide
by
a
statute
and
adopt.
this
is
a
case
and
the
other
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
brief
are
cases
that
have
arisen
as
a
result
of
an
unseaworthy
condition
that
arose
aboard
the
vessel,
or
negligence
that
arose
aboard
the
vessel,
that
proximately
resulted
in
injury
aboard
the
dock.
and
the
--
i
have
to
jump
because
my
time
is
just
about
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
what
happened?
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
broken
bags
of
cargo
were
being
discharged
from
the
vessel.
they
were
unseaworthy
when
they
were
in
the
vessel.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
by
draft,
by
a
pallet,
and
as
they
were
being
discharged
and
across
the
ships
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
before
--
while
they're
still
on
the
--
still
connected
to
the
ship
that
they
swung
--
the
thing
swung
over,
then
grain
was
falling
onto
the
pier.
they
have
been
observed
--
there
have
been
observance
of
this
all
since
the
commencement
of
operation.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
there
is
no
question
--
there's
no.
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
there's
no
question
that
there
would
have
been
liability.
i
don't
think
it
might
--
mr.
harvey
b.
nachman
that's
right.
i
have
no
further
time,
mr.
justice
black,
but
in
the
amicus
brief,
they
say
that
this
cannot
extend
because
there
is
no
jurisdictions
in
admiralty
to
the
pier,
but
admiralty
extension
act
of
1948
specifically
included
these
kind
of
occurrences,
injury
to
persons
and
property
on
the
shore,
it's
been
held
constitutional
and
has
been
applied
in
all
of
the
cases
that
are
cited
in
this
brief.
