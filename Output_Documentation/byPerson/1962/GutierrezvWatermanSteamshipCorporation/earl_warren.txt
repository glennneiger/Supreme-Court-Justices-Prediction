chief
justice
earl

mr.
bird,
suppose
this
man
was
injured
by
the
beans
themselves
falling,
suppose
instead
of
him
slipping
on
the
mat,
they
had
hit
the
dock.
they
had
these
falling
beans
had
hit
him
in
the
eyes
and
it
blinded
him,
would
you
still
say
that
there
--
the
liability
of
the
ship
had
terminated
because
the
boom
had
passed
over
the
rail
of
the
ship?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
under
those
circumstances,
no
matter
what
the
negligence
of
the
ship
might
be,
there
would
be
no
liability
just
because
he
didn't
have
the
obligation
to
clean
it
up.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
mr.
bird
you
told
me
a
moment
ago
there
was
no
question
of
negligence
in
this
case.
it
may
sue
for
both
unseaworthy
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
must
--
we
just
misunderstood
each
other.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
alright.
alright,
okay.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
do
you
do
with
finding
9,
which
says
that
the
shipowner
was
negligent
in
committing
the
broken
and
weakened
bags
to
be
discharged
when
it
knew
or
should
have
known
that
injury
was
likely
to
result
to
persons
in
the
service
of
the
ship
who
had
to
work
on
and
about
the
spilled
beans.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
evidence
that
mr.
justice
brennan
just
called
to
your
attention
about
them
having
knowledge
of
it
to
the
extent
that
they
had
these
bags
being
repaired
on
the
ship
during
the
course
of
the
operation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
counsel
said
that
--
that
he
gave
you
a
list
of
all
of
his
witnesses
and
that
the
company
never
even
took
the
trouble
to
interrogate
any
of
them?
