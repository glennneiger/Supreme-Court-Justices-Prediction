justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
stating
in
a
sentence
just
exactly
what
happened?
you
say
that
--
you're
drawing
your
distinction
in
showing
seaworthy,
what
happened?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
it
that
happened
that
was
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
were
they
being
discharged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
they
got
to
the
shore.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
the
argument
is
that
the
fact
that
beans
were
dropped
on
the
floor
of
the
boat
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
[inaudible]
tried
that
there
would
have
been
liability.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
depends
on
whether
it
extends
to
the
injury
brought
about
by
the
same
swinging
over
and
dropping
of
the
beans.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that
--
difference
does
that
make
if
there
were
testimony
whether
you're
standing
on
the
dock
instead
on
the
top
of
the
ship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
remember
the
case,
i
forgot
the
name
of
it,
it
was
decided
by
mr.
justice
mcreynolds
as
i
recall
it,
to
the
effect
that
--
let's
say
one
of
these
swinging
things
that
let
open
and
hit
a
man
on
the
dock,
the
ship
couldn't
be
held
liable
because
of
that
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
as
i
recall
it
--
as
i
recall
it,
we
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
the
court
went
on
the
basis
--
maybe
i'm
wrong
--
that
they
couldn't
show
that
these
particular
beans
have
either
--
have
stepped
on
and
fell
were
the
beans
that
came
out
of
these
particular
sacks,
that's
defective.
justice
hugo
l.
black
wasn't
that
one
of
its
grounds?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
grounds?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
--
you
mean
that
the
[inaudible]
that
the
evidence
that
some
beans
fell,
came
out
of
the
sacks
above,
evidence
that
some
of
the
beans
were
came
from
a
broken
sack?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
couldn't
tell
which
beans
he
had
slipped
on
and
therefore
there's
no
evidence
of
negligence.
we
had
something
like
that
about
the
railroad
crackers
some
years
ago,
so
they
couldn't
prove
which
cracker
he
fell
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
ground,
isn't
it,
but
the
court
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
negligence
because
he
couldn't
show
that
the
particular
bean
that
he
happened
to
fall
over.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
that
had
come
from
the
above.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
standing
on
that
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are?
