mr.
antonio
m.
bird
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there's
one
point
i
think
should
be
cleared
at
the
beginning
and
it
is
the
fact
that
this
vessel
was
being
discharged
by
an
independent
stevedoring
contractor.
and
there's
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
the
record
that
any
member
of
the
crew
or
any
officer
of
the
vessel
in
anyway
had
anything
to
do
with
the
discharging
operations
of
the
vessel.
we
will
concede
that
the
negligent
acts
of
the
stevedoring
contractor
can
make
a
vessel
unseaworthy
or
can
make
the
vessel
liable
based
on
unseaworthiness,
but
our
best
part
under
this
case
is
the
fact
that
this
accident
happened
in
an
area
over
which
the
vessel
had
absolutely
no
right
whatsoever
of
control.
the
petitioner
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
no,
your
honor.
in
that
case,
under
the
doctrine
established
in
the
strika
case,
the
vessel
was
unseaworthy
and
on
an
unseaworthy
condition
of
the
vessel
caused
the
injury
to
the
man
on
shore
and
the
vessel
would
be
liable.
but
our
contention
is
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
in
answering
to
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question,
i
was
assuming
that
this
is
a
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
no,
i
would
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
if
the
accident
happened
inside
of
a
hole
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
--
on
board
the
vessel,
and
an
unseaworthy
condition
was
created
because
there
was
an
unsafe
place
to
work
onboard
the
vessel,
then
i
will
concede
that
the
vessel
will
be
liable.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
mr.
justice
white,
you
must
consider
that
from
the
moment
those
bags
are
being
discharged
from
the
vessel
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
yes.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
then
it's
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
it's
the
duty
of
the
master
of
the
vessel
to
see
that
those
beans
are
swept
there,
there
are
beans
carried
on
the
deck
of
the
vessel.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
that's
my
divide
on
line
for
the
reasons
that
the
vessel
has
absolutely
no
control
of
what's
going
on
the
dock.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
the
evidence
that
it
is
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
that
while
they
were
in
the
process
of
being
discharged,
there
was
spillage
and
that
there
was
some
breakage.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
witnesses
who
have
testified,
were
men
who
were
standing
on
the
dock.
we
don't
have
any
evidence
on
this
record
after
what
happened
onboard
the
vessel.
there
was
no
testimony
from
any
witnesses
working
aboard
the
vessel.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
the
only
testimony
there
is,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
that
while
they
were
on
the
process
of
being
discharged,
there
was
spillage
on
the
dock.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
i
don't
know
of
any
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
this
was
the
testimony
of
a
man
that
is
standing
on
a
dock,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
came
out
of
the
hold.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
that's
my
position,
your
honor.
once
that
the
spillage
was
on
the
dock,
it
was
the
duty
then
of
the
stevedoring
contractor
to
sweep
that
area
and
it
was
not
the
duty
of
the
vessel
nor
put
the
vessel
or
even
go
to
that
place
and
order
this
work
to
be
done.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
mr.
justice
white,
our
position
is
that
this
condition,
if
it's
existed
onboard
the
vessel,
it
could
make
the
vessel
or
it
would
make
the
vessel
unseaworthy,
if
the
man
had
been
injured
on
the
vessel
because
of
the
possession
and
control,
the
method
has
on
the
vessel.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
because
this
is
something
that
can
be
controlled
by
the
ship,
the
boom,
it
can
be
controlled
by
the
ship.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
if
they
know
but
there's
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
the
ship
knew
that
the
bags
were
defective.
there's
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
this
record
that
the
ship
knew
that
the
bags
were
defective.
the
only
evidence
is
that
the
stevedoring
contractor
who
was
discharging
these
bags
and
there
was
a
spillage
and
there
was
breakage,
and
that
one
bag
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
and
those
coopers
were
the
employees
of
the
stevedoring
contractor.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
yes.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
yes.
yes,
it's
correct.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
no.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
because
your
honor,
at
that
point,
that
is
something
that
was
under
control
of
the
ship.
i
mean,
if
something
falls
from
the
ship
and
injures
the
workman,
the
workman
then
the
ship
can
be
held
liable
because
this
condition
was
created
on
the
ship,
but
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
this
condition
was
created
on
the
dock.
this
is
something
that
fell
on
the
dock
--
spillage
is
something,
i
mean,
which
is
common
knowledge,
this
is
part
of
the
regular
stevedoring
operations.
i
mean,
this
is
something
you
will
have
always
when
you're
discharging
grain
or
rice
or
beans.
and
once
they're
on
the
pier,
the
only
way
of
correcting
their
condition
would
be
by
sweeping
and
that
is
something
which
is
beyond
the
control
of
the
vessel.
the
master
of
the
vessel
cannot
go
on
shore
until
this
people
were
told
what
they
should
do.
it's
beyond
his
control.
now
there's
one
other
point
which
has
been
raised
in
this
--
the
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
oh
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there's
negligence
of
the
vessel
and
there's
liability
but
we're
not
in
--
we're
not
considering
there
was
any
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
vessel
in
this
case.
that's
the
difference.
if
there's
--
if
there's
negligence
in
the
vessel,
then
there's
liability,
but
in
this
case
we're
not
considering
there's
any
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
vessel.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
well
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
there
are
two
or
three
cases
(voice
overlap)
there
are
two
or
three
cases.
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
extension
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
act,
there
were
several
cases
which
held
that
the
claim
of
damages
for
injuries
on
a
dock
side
were
to
be
ruled
by
the
local
state
law.
now,
one
of
the
points
we
have
raised
is
that
the
court
lacks
jurisdiction
because
its
jurisdiction
is
based
precisely
on
the
extension
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
act.
this
act
specifically
extends
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
to
injury
to
persons
caused
by
vessels,
injury
to
person
caused
by
vessels.
in
this
case,
the
injury,
i
cannot
â€“
[inaudible]
alleged
it
was
caused
by
the
vessel,
the
injury
was
caused
by
a
condition
which
existed
on
the
dock
created
by
the
fellow
workers
of
the
petitioner
himself.
there's
no
evidence,
there's
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
record
to
show
that
the
vessel
in
any
way,
in
any
way
contributed
in
any
manner
to
this
injury.
the
only
evidence
there
is
and
i
repeat
is
the
fact
that
this
cargo
was
being
discharged
by
the
fellow
workers
of
the
petitioner
who
received
the
instructions
of
their
employer
and
that
they
failed
to
correct
this
condition
created
by
themselves
on
the
dock,
it
was
in
no
way
created
by
the
vessel
or
by
the
ship.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
no,
your
honor
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
mr.
chief
justice,
i
must
have
misunderstood
your
question.
i
don't
claim
that
there's
not
an
issue
of
negligence
on
this
case.
on
the
contrary,
i
consider
it's
an
issue
of
negligence,
but
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
yes.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
but
my
contention
is
that
the
court
had
no
basis
whatsoever
to
make
a
finding
of
negligence.
my
distinguished
brother
has
spoken
about
the
test
of
foreseeability.
well,
there's
not
a
scintilla,
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
the
ship
had
any
knowledge
whatsoever
of
this
condition
on
the
dock.
the
only
evidence
i
repeat,
the
only
evidence
there
is,
is
to
the
fact
that
the
condition
was
created
by
the
independent
stevedoring
contractor.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
our
position
is
here
that
--
as
it
was
in
the
circuit
court,
that
the
court,
the
trial
court,
had
no
basis
whatsoever
to
make
that
finding.
there
was
no
basis
for
the
trial
court
to
make
such
a
finding.
that
the
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
by
the
independent
stevedoring
contractor
who
was
in
charge
of
the
operations,
but
there's
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
the
vessel
in
any
way,
in
any
way
had
anything
to
do
with
this
type
of
work.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
well,
there
was
evidence
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
yes,
there
was
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
there
was
evidence
before
the
court
that
there
was
spillage
but
there
was
also
that
during
the
process
of
discharging,
a
bag
fell
from
about
35
feet
high,
fell
on
the
dock
and
spread
its
contents.
so
we
had
there
beans
which
had
fallen
while
being
discharged
by
the
stevedoring
contractor,
had
fallen
from
the
pallet,
[inaudible]
of
any
evidence
whatsoever
that
the
ship
had
anything
to
do
with
that
work?
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
yes.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
well
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
that's
one
of
the
grounds
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
that's
one
of
the
grounds
for
the
reversal
of
court
of
appeals.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
well,
that
was
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
one
of
the
grounds,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
oh
yes,
i
also
stand
on
that
ground.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
yes,
sir.
i
stand
on
that
ground.
there
is
one
last
point
and
it's
--
it's
a
question
of
laches.
the
trial
court
ruled
out
the
defense
of
laches
under
the
theory
that
because
the
witnesses
were
available
and
because
there
were
certain
records
available
that
the
respondent
had
not
been
in
anyway
prejudiced,
the
record
clearly
shows
--
one,
that
petitioner
after
having
hired
an
attorney,
he
slumbered
in
his
rights
for
several
months
until
he
retained
the
firm
of
messers
nachman
on
feldstein.
first
having
spoken
to
them
and
explaining
his
problem,
and
because
messers
nachman
or
feldstein
could
not
handle
the
case
until
they
obtained
clearance
from
mr.
cole,
they
waited
until
five
or
six
months
after
the
petitioner
spoke
to
mr.
feldstein.
i
will
concede
that
this
by
itself,
will
not
bar
the
action
unless
it
is
shown
that
the
respondent
was
prejudiced
by
the
delay.
now,
the
record
shows
very
clearly
that
this
petitioner,
shortly
after
the
appearance,
he
gave
out
sworn
statements
to
an
investigator
of
the
puerto
rico
state
insurance
funds
and
in
that
sworn
statement,
he
describes
the
occurrence
as
--
that
when
he
--
the
winchman
pulled
a
sling
in
order
to
protect
himself,
he
had
to
back
out
and
he
fell.
now,
at
the
trial,
he
gives
an
entirely
different
version.
petitioner
also
in
the
first
statement
gives
the
hour
of
the
occurrences
as
--
that
it
happened
at
10
in
the
morning,
at
a
deposition,
he
gives
sometime
earlier
than
the
other
time,
and
then
at
trial,
he
gives
another
time.
we
raised
these
points
to
show
that
the
memory
of
the
witnesses
after
over
three
years
was
not
the
same,
i
mean,
their
memory;
they
could
not
recall
the
instance
of
the
actual
occurrences
as
they
actually
happened,
and
we
believe
that
for
that
reason,
there
was
enough
in
the
records
to
show
that
the
respondent
had
been
prejudiced,
was
prejudiced,
and
that
the
action
was
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
antonio
m.
bird
after,
this
is
something
i
might
even
have
to
go
off
the
record,
i
mean,
you
have
to
know
the
problems
we
have
with
investigating
of
these
cases
in
puerto
rico
where
this
longshoreman
have
refused
to
even
discuss
the
cases.
by
the
time
we've
got
that,
that
list,
all
this
time
had
left,
they
had
already
been
retained
by
--
i
mean
the
--
libellants
had
already
retained
his
counsel
and
these
were
their
witnesses,
the
one
who
want
to
testify
for
the
libellants.
at
the
time
of
trial,
it
was
shown
at
the
end
that
their
memory
--
and
this
was
not
too
long
after
the
filing
of
the
libel,
not
such
a
long
period
went
by
from
the
filing
of
the
libel
which
were
the
first
time
that
the
respondent
learned
of
the
clients.
the
respondent
didn't
--
had
any
knowledge
whatsoever
of
the
clients
until
about
two
and
a
half
years
after
the
--
after
the
--
the
accident.
there
is
one
last
point
which
was
raised
by
my
brother
here,
and
he
mentioned
for
the
fact
that
we
should
adopt
uniform
statute
of
limitations
in
this
connection
with
this
case,
and
he
suggests
that
we
follow
the
two-year
stat
--
statute
of
limitations
provided
by
the
jones
act.
i
would
respectfully
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
for
the
fact
that
it
is
the
law
in
our
jurisdiction
as
established
in
a
case
called,
flores
versus
[inaudible]
decided
by
the
first
circuit
a
couple
of
years
ago
that
when
a
seaman
is
injured
within
the
territory
--
territorial
waters
of
puerto
rico
and
his
employer
is
covered
by
the
local
workmen's
compensation
act,
that
the
remedy
of
that
seaman,
the
exclusive
remedy
is
to
go
before
the
puerto
rico
state
insurance
fund
and
he
cannot
sue
his
employer
under
the
jones
act.
that
case
was
decided
by
the
first
circuit
and
this
court;
they
denied
a
petition
for
certiorari.
i
would
suggest
that
if
that
is
the
law
in
connection
with
the
seaman
in
puerto
rico,
because
of
the
special
distinction
has
been
made,
because
of
puerto
rico's
peculiar
political
status,
i
would
say,
that
in
the
case
of
a
longshoreman
which
is
discovered
by
the
workmen's
compensation
act,
which
congress
has
delegated
and
the
legislator
of
puerto
rico
to
ruin
on
his
rights.
if
the
local
law
of
puerto
rico
establishes
the
one
year
statute
of
limitations,
i
believe
that
an
exception
should
be
made
in
that
case
particularly
when
the
provisions
of
the
jones
act
are
not
applicable
to
either
a
seaman
or
longshoreman
injured
within
the
territorial
waters
of
puerto
rico.
