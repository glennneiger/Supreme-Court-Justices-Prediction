justice

do
you
question
â€“
do
you
question
the
statement
of
the
state
that
this
is
done
routinely
for
everybody
in
that
event?
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
made
the
determination?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
giving
the
defendant
more
than
he's
entitled
to
under
the
mississippi
law,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
court
had
simply
called
the
jury
that
the
--
the
court
had
determined
that
the
confession
was
voluntary,
that's
all.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
that
would've
been
more
helpful
to
the
defendant
than
the
charge
of
the
accused?
justice
potter
stewart
do

i
understood
it

the
outset
of
arguments
you
conceded
that
if
the
allegations,
the
allegations
which
had
been
made
by
the
petitioner
were
true
that
this
man's
conviction
should
be
reversed.
did
i
understand
that
correctly?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
does
that
suggest
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
it
and
i
had
particular
reference
to
what
you're
talking
about
now
that
this
extra
--
outside
the
record,
un-sworn
statements
that
he
had
been
hit
over
the
head
or
at
least
that
his
head
was
bleeding
when
he
was
brought
back
[inaudible]
to
his
house.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
that's
what
i
was
going
to
ask
you.
justice
potter
stewart
it
suggested
--
it
suggested
that
he
had
a
lawyer
long
before
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
in
your
--
that's
in
your
affidavit.
justice
potter
