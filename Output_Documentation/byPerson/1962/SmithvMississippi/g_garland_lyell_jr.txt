mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
this
is
my
first
appearance
before
this
honorable
court.
i
always
thought
it
was
an
appellate
court
and
not
one
where
evidentiary
proceedings
took
place.
i
would
be
the
first
to
admit
that
if
the
implications
and
charges
by
my
brethren
in
their
brief
and
in
their
argument
were
true,
this
court
should
reverse
the
conviction
of
this
petitioner.
however,
those
things
are
not
reflected
by
the
record.
some
of
them
i
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
are
not
true
and
while
i
hate
to
be
put
in
the
position
of
testifying,
i
feel
that
i
must.
if
i
may
say
this,
to
set
the
scene,
canton,
mississippi
is
about
22
miles
north
of
jackson,
the
capital
city.
it's
the
county
seat
of
madison
county.
it's
a
typical
courthouse
square
town.
i
don't
know
the
population,
just
a
few
thousand
people.
this
crime
took
place
just
a
few
miles
outside
of
canton
late
at
night
where
these
children
had
no
place
to
be.
the
petitioner
was
arrested.
he
was
taken
to
jail.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
there
was
any
coercion
whatsoever
used
to
get
the
confession
from
this
petitioner
except
his
lone
statement
out
of
the
premise
of
the
jury
to
the
effect
that
they've
told
them
they
were
going
to
take
him
back
to
canton
and
let
a
mob
crowd
him.
well,
i
submit
those
things
are
usually
found
and
practically
all
confession
cases
that
where
a
person
confesses
and
finds
himself
in
court
confronted
with
it.
he
tries
to
get
out
of
it
some
way.
i
want
say
that
this
counsel,
court
appointed
counsel
told
him
to
say
that
or
whether
he
dreamed
of
that
himself
but
suffice
then
to
say,
the
court
inquired
very
carefully
into
the
voluntary
nature
of
the
confession.
and
incidentally
on
that
score,
the
reason
for
bringing
all
these
witnesses
from
hinds
county,
who
were
witnesses
to
the
confession,
is
this.
we
have
a
rule
in
mississippi.
our
supreme
court
will
reverse
a
confession
case
on
objection
if
all
the
witnesses
to
the
confession
do
not
testify.
you've
got
to
produce
them
all,
hence
the
number
of
witnesses
that
came
up
to
testify
in
this
case.
it's
another
--
it's
a
safeguard
to
the
defendant
rather
than
something
prejudicial.
counsel
speaks
of
a
dragnet
in
the
brief
of
12
hour
inquisition.
i
submit
that
none
of
that's
in
the
record.
i
find
nothing
about
it
and
knowing
the
geographical
locations
of
these
things,
i
can
well
understand
that
it
took
perhaps
12
hours
to
do
all
these
things,
traveling
back
and
forth.
he
was
not
--
because
he
had
no
counsel
at
the
time
of
the
confession
and
nowhere
that
i
find
that
this
court
has
held
that
you
must
have
counsel.
that
would
be
an
unreasonable
restriction
on
the
police
investigation
i
believe
as
this
court
has
stated.
as
to
the
preliminary
hearing,
here
is
our
procedure.
we
have
no
continuous
circuit
court
or
trial
court
for
the
felony
cases.
there
are
court
terms
and
i
believe
that
two
or
perhaps
three
in
madison
county
a
year.
it's
in
the
same
circuit,
fourth
district
with
hinds
county.
the
only
magistrate
before
whom
an
accused
can
be
taken
for
preliminary
inquiry
or
hearing
is
a
justice
of
the
peace.
they
have
--
they
are
not
in
continuous
session
even
though
they
can
expressly
sit.
our
statutes
require
it.
we
have
no
commission
of
such
as
the
u.s.
commission.
our
statute
does
require
that
persons
accused
of
crime
be
taken
without
an
--
unnecessary
delay
before
a
magistrate.
however,
our
supreme
court,
state
supreme
court
has
held
that
will
not
--
that
neither
that
know
the
absence
of
a
preliminary
hearing
will
void
a
subsequent
prosecute
--
prosecution
and
a
conviction.
it
is
not
essential
to
exert
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
have
no
idea,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
did
not
participate
in
the
trial.
i
only
have
a
case
--
i've
been
--
our
state
supreme
court.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
all
i
know
is
what's
in
this
brief
if
we
can
take
that
as
fact
and
that's
predicated
on
two
newspaper
items,
one
in
the
jackson
paper,
one
in
the
madison
county
paper
to
the
effect
that
the
accused
had
waived
the
preliminary
hearing.
and
i
submit
that
at
least
with
interest
to
the
decision
you
handed
down
yesterday,
i
believe
in
the
case
from
maryland
and
i
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
the
white
--
white
versus
maryland
and
i
certainly
don't
think
this
situation
would
be
equated
with
that.
he
made
--
entered
no
plea,
just
waived
the
hearing.
knowing
the
purpose
of
that
hearing
in
mississippi
is
to
determine
if
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
hold
him,
to
await
facts
from
the
grand
jury.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
sir?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
if
they
waive,
there
is
not
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
if
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
yes,
we
do.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
i
don't
how
i
--
however,
this
court
or
anyone
can
determine
whether
or
not
this
court
appointed
counsel
did
all
that
could
be
done
to
this
petitioner.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
it
does.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
always
if
requested,
most
of
them
waive
it
on
its
--
its
only
on
felony
cases,
most
of
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
--
most
of
the
accused
waive
it
for
the
obvious
reasons,
quite
contrary
to
what
my
brother
had
to
say.
there
are
very
obvious
reasons
why
a
guilty
accused
would
want
to
wave
it
for
evidence
then
have
the
case
more
fully
developed
against
them
at
a
preliminary
hearing.
i
believe
it
was
in
avery
versus
alabama
that
the
court
remarked
on
the
rural
aspects
of
the
case.
canton
is
that
type
of
locality,
they're
concerned
with
more
people
than
they
were
in
the
–
[inaudible]
alabama.
this
court
appointed
lawyer,
was
one
of
the
oldest
lawyers
of
the
canton
bar.
he
was
selected
by
the
trial
judge
because
of
his
experience
and
he
is
even
characterized
in
the
petition
filed
in
this
court
as
an
experienced
trial
lawyer.
he's
that
type
of
person,
his
office
is
right
across
the
street
from
the
courthouse
even
they
--
everybody
there
knows
what's
going
on,
communications
are
easy.
and
i
dare
say
even
though
this
is
a
serious
case
and
a
capital
case
that
it
would
be
one
of
the
most
simple
types
of
cases
to
investigate.
so,
it's
quite
logical
that
even
though
he
was
only
appointed
on
a
wednesday
and
the
next
day
announced
ready
for
trial
on
the
following
monday,
that
he
had
ample
opportunity
after
discussing
the
case
with
his
client,
to
interview
every
conceivable
witnesses
the
client
could
give
him,
and
to
make
any
other
independent
investigation.
certainly,
it
was
that
he
voluntarily
announced
ready
for
trial,
he
was
not
pushed
into
it.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
no
sir,
regular
term,
mr.
justice
black.
the
crime
took
place
about
--
the
4th
of
july.
the
court
did
not
meet
until
i
believe
was
the
third
monday
of
september.
so
not
--
the
only
time
that
the
attorneys
were
appointed
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
in
my
--
sir?
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
court
met
on
monday.
a
grand
jury
was
drawn,
the
grand
jury
was
returned
on
--
the
indictment
was
returned
on
wednesday.
the
counsel
was
appointed.
he
was
arraigned
on
thursday
with
counsel
present.
the
case
was
set
to
call
the
following
morning,
friday,
at
which
time
both
the
state
and
the
defense
announced
ready
for
trial
on
the
following
monday.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
don't
re
--
i
don't
know
possibly
four
--
three,
four,
five
weeks,
yes
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
in
that
county,
i
think
they're
just
two,
perhaps
three.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
spring
and
fall.
spring
and
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
spring
and
fall,
yes
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
at
any
time,
your
honor.
if
the
challenge
--
the
qualifications,
it
must
be
done
before
this
forum.
not
to
make
of
it
of
con
–
how
it
was
constituted.
a
motion
--
to
quash
the
indictment
is
a
proper
procedure
to
reset
on
a
constitutional
grand
jury.
i
might
say
this;
all
of
these
things
are
so
speculated.
who
would
know
better
than
this
lawyer
as
to
whether
or
not
he
needed
the
change
of
venue.
it
became
necessary
in
this
case
for
me
to
get
an
affidavit
from
the
trial
judge
and
attach
to
this
brief.
i
never
heard
of
such
a
practice
but
i
have
to
do
it
because
of
the
affidavits
attached
to
the
petitioner's
brief.
there
was
one
there
that
i
couldn't
let
go
unanswered
even
though
the
judge
didn't
want
to
dignify
it
with
an
answer.
and
in
that
affidavit,
each
page
among
other
things
that
the
atmosphere
here
was
not
a
motion
charged
as
is
charged
here.
so
if
we
can't
--
this
court
on
this
record
can't
condemn
this
lawyer
for
not
asking
for
a
continuance,
for
a
change
of
venue.
it
suggested
or
urged
that
he
should've
raised
a
question
of
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
jury
service.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i've
got
documentary
evidence
here
that
there
were
negroes
on
both
the
grand
jury
and
the
petit
jury.
the
grand
jury
had
indicted
him
and
the
petit
jury
had
tried
him.
it's
that
type
of
thing
that
i'm
confronted
with
here
and
it's
particularly
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
by
motion
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
by
motion
to
quash
the
indictment.
that
would
be
to
waive
to
reset.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
must've
misunderstood
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
that
would
be
as
to
the
qualificate
--
qualification
of
a
particular
person
to
sit
on
that
grand
jury.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
he
wouldn't
have
because
the
grand
jury
was
empanelled
on
the
first
day
of
court
which
would've
been
monday.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
i
didn't
realize
that
that
point
was
going
to
be
argued
here.
i
don't
recall
that
it
was
raised
in
the
brief
and
i
don't
--
it's
conceivable
of
course,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
someone
inimical
to
any
particular
defendant
that
the
--
on
a
grand
jury
and
sway
that
grand
jury
in
returning
an
indictment.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes
sir,
under
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
the
criminal
record
they
set
your
honor.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment,
yes.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes,
any
time
prior,
yes
sir.
there's
a
--
something
in
here
i
hate
to
even
mention
but
i
feel
that
i
have
to
because
of
the
vigorous
attack
on
the
activities
of
the
court
appointed
lawyer,
of
counsel
on
his
brief,
of
petitioner,
as
one
william
l.
higgs,
who
was
recently
been
associated
with
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
he
filed
an
affidavit
attached
to
this
brief
made
of
--
before
my
brother
wulf
here
of
notary
public,
that
on
the
morning
that
this
petitioner
was
arraigned
from
his
office
in
jackson,
mississippi
he
called
the
circuit
judge
at
the
courthouse
in
canton
and
that
the
judge
he
--
to
tell
him
that
he
had
been
employed
by
the
family
of
this
petitioner
to
represent
him.
and
that
this
judge
and
i
had
assumed
to
believe
of
either
one
of
you
honorable
gentlemen,
then
of
this
particular
judge,
that
this
judge
personally
threatened
him
and
told
him
his
life
would
be
in
danger
if
he
came
to
canton,
mississippi
to
defend
this
man
and
that
he
followed
the
judge's
suggestion
and
didn't
come.
well,
what's
left
behind
that
affidavit;
i
had
to
get
an
affidavit
from
judge
henry
to
counteract
that
thing
and
in
his
affidavit
he
says,
the
only
thing
true
in
mr.
higgs'
affidavit
is
that
he
did
call
me.
what
happened
was
this?
he
called
judge
henry
just
as
he
was
about
to
respond
to
the
motion
of
the
court
appointed
counsel
to
draw
a
special
venire
of
i
think
60
men,
get
him
out
of
the
courtroom,
did
tell
him
that
he
had
been
approached
to
represent
this
man,
says
henry
told
him
that
he
had
already
appointed
this
lawyer
but
that
he
was
going
to
represent
him,
i
suggest
you
get
right
on
up
here
to
the
courthouse
and
he
hasn't
come
yet.
but
that
the
interesting
aspect
to
that
affidavit
of
mr.
higgs,
if
there's
any
truth
at
all
in
it
while
he
would
condemn,
derelict
--
so-called
derelictions
on
the
part
experienced
court
appointed
attorney.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
this
second
sentence
in
the
affidavit.
smith
also
requested
me
to
represent
him
when
i
first
saw
him
and
talked
to
him
in
the
hinds
county
jail
in
jackson,
mississippi.
he
could
only
have
been
employed
by
smith
at
the
hinds
county
jail
in
jackson,
mississippi
before
this
term
of
court
ever
convened
in
canton.
if
anyway,
if
he
were
employed
as
he
speaks
in
his
own
--
his
own
affidavit
in
this
brief
by
this
man
at
the
jail
in
jackson
to
represent
him.
he
was
most
derelict
in
his
duty
not
even
coming
to
court
and
yet
he
and
counsel
in
this
case
would
severely
criticize
what
the
court
appointed
counsel
did.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
not
so
much,
mr.
justice.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
i
understood
your
question
to
be
a
retained
lawyer.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
and
then
--
you
finish
your
question
by
saying
one
day
after
appointment.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
can't
answer
that
question.
of
course
i
as
a
lawyer
would
certainly
try
to
get
all
the
time
i
could.
i
think
one
of
you
would,
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
condemn
it,
i
don't
think.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
i
understand
that.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
but,
well,
very
--
it's
often
said
that
if
you
win
your
lawsuit
--
no,
but
i
got
a
continuance,
it's
the
next
best
thing.”
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
from
canton.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
know.
there
must
be
20,
i
suppose,
15,
20.
they
have
a
small
town,
very
strong
bar
there.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
when
court
--
when
they
returned
the
indictment
then
they
brought
him
back
up
to
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
--
madison
county.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
can't
answer
that
with
certainty
because
if
the
record
doesn't
show
it
in
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
all
the
record
shows
he
was
indicted
on
wednesday.
the
indictment
was
returned.
why
they
brought
him
from
the
hinds
county
jail
back
to
the
madison
county
jail
on
the
day
court
convened
that,
i
don't
know.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
as
soon
as
the
indictments
are
returned
and
i
think
that's
what
the
record
in
this
case
will
show.
first,
find
out
if
the
accused,
the
defendant
has
an
attorney
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
should
say
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
sometimes
yes,
and
sometimes
no.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
they
vary
--
made
of
some,
mr.
justice
white.
until
gideon
versus
wainwright
at
the
other
day,
we
didn't
appoint
counsel
in
any
thing
but
capital
cases.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
but
it
provides
for
the
sum
of
$75
if
you
--
if
you
can
cap
a
guilty
plea,
$150
to
defend
him
in
--
at
a
trial,
then
another
$100
to
carry
the
thing
to
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
is
the
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
that's
the
statute
that
provides
it
be
paid
out
of
county
funds,
in
the
county
in
which
the
case
was
tried.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
three.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
have
a
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
two
circuit
judges
who
sit
in
all
three
of
those
counties.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
they
ultimately
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
jackson,
hinds
county,
the
capital
city,
it
is
one
of
these
three
counties,
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
they
are
fixed
by
statute.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
one
district
attorney
for
the
circuit
and
then
each
county
within
the
district
has
a
county
prosecuting
attorney
who
works
with
the
district
attorney
in
the
prosecution
of
these
cases.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
sounds
identical,
mr.
justice.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
would
estimate
a
total
of
six,
eight
thousand.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
[inaudible]
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
oh,
just
an
average,
average-size
county.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
was
--
i
should
say,
30
miles,
or
more
into
the
other.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
adjoined
to
the
north,
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
no,
sir.
it's
just
one
of
the
burdens
of
the
profession
and
the
lawyer's
practice
--
gentlemen
from
lake
charles,
louisiana
here
yesterday,
he
just
had
to
bear
himself
and
i
might
probably
say
that
i
was
to
do
their
share.
i
don't
believe
my
brother
here
got
into
this
aspect
of
the
thing
unless
perhaps
he
says
or
some
remarks
about
it.
he
had
suggested
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
case
where
the
court
might
extend
the
mcnabb-mallory
rule
to
a
state
court
confession
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
there
are
two
cases
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
canton.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
if
the
court
will
bear
in
mind
that
this
arrest
took
place
on
a
sunday
morning,
about
4:30.
and
the
confession
was
obtained
that
afternoon
at
the
highway
patrol
headquarters.
there
are
two
cases
in
which
this
court
has
denied
certiorari,
where
that
question
was
raised;
one
was
a
federal
case
from
the
second
circuit,
united
states
versus
walker
and
the
other
one
was
another
case
from
my
own
state
of
mississippi,
robinson
versus
mississippi.
and
the
substance
of
the
holding
of
those
cases
is
that
the
petitioner
has
a
burden
of
proof
that
a
magistrate
was
available
before
whom
he
could
be
taken
and
be
charged
with
the
crime.
the
robinson
case
was
likewise
on
a
sunday
morning
in
which
there
was
neither
a
grand
jury
in
session
or
justice
of
the
peace
which
is
the
only
other
magistrate
available
there
and
that
therefore,
the
cases
did
not
come
--
could
not
come
within
that
rule.
there
are
other
things
in
here,
factual
matters
which
i
say
i
hesitate
to
testify
and
i'm
going
to
quit
but
the
things
charged
in
here
that
--
by
affidavit
attached
to
this
brief,
not
only
as
to
treatment
of
the
petitioner
before
his
interrogation
but
after.
their
affidavits
or
they
are
actually
not
affidavits
but
their
statements
signed
before
a
notary
public
but
not
sworn
to
one
to
the
effect
that
when
the
officers
brought
this
man
back
to
his
house
to
get
the
watch,
the
knife,
the
clothing
and
so
forth,
he
was
dazed,
his
head
was
bloody,
he
had
cut
in.
all
the
--
i
have
no
way
of
refusing
that.
i
could
have
gone
out
and
gotten
a
stack
of
affidavits
[inaudible].
there
are
other
things
of
that
nature
that
i
just
don't
believe
this
court
will
pay
any
attention
to
being
an
appellate
court.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
if
they
can
be
substantiated,
the
allegations
of
the
petitioner
as
well
as
the
ex
parte
statement
as
an
affidavit
or
so-called
affidavits
in
his
brief
i'd
be
the
last
one
to
say
it
should
be
reversed.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
that
is
with
respect
to
any
actual
coercion,
not
on
the
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
if
those
things
were
true,
if
those
things
were
true,
i
believe
he
has
a
very
simple
remedy
by
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
and
i
believe
this
court
has
made
it
very
plain
and
spelled
it
out
in
some
recent
cases
last
month,
fay
versus
noia,
douglas
versus
california
and
some
others
that
he
doesn't
--
not
only
doesn't
have
to
exhaust
his
state
route
now
but
--
but
this
proceeding
right
here
today
is
unnecessary.
