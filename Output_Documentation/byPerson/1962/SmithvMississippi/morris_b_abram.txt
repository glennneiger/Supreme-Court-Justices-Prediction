mr.
morris
b.
abram
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
this
case
which
comes
to
the
court
on
a
writ
to
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
presents
three
questions.
the
first
is
the
right
of
counsel
--
to
counsel
of
a
25
year
old
negro,
arrested
and
convicted
of
rape
and
given
a
capital
sentence
in
the
state
of
mississippi
on
and
in
the
county
of
madison.
this
negro,
being
a
functional
illiterate
being
--
having
--
had
only
a
second
grade
education,
having
been
arrested
on
july
the
30th,
1961
and
not
having
counsel
assigned
to
him
for
either
52
or
53
days
while
he
was
detained
in
solitary
detention.
having
had
no
counsel
at
his
confession,
having
had
no
counsel
at
his
preliminary
hearing,
and
having
counsel
assigned
to
him
on
his
arraignment
on
the
21st
of
september.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
yes
sir
i'm
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
the
record
your
honor
is
silent
on
that
point.
mississippi
law
requires
it
and
i
think
it
is
conceded
by
all
that
he
did
have
one
on
august
the
3rd
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
--
but
it
is
not
in
the
record.
you
will
understand
mr.
justice
stewart
that
this
record
is
somewhat
fragmentary
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
are
claiming
that
he
had
ineffective
counsel.
and
of
course
the
record
i
think
reflects
this.
but
in
any
event,
he
did
have
counsel
appointed
on
the
21st
when
on
the
22nd,
the
venire
was
drawn,
his
counsel
announced
that
he
was
ready
for
trial
on
the
25th.
now,
the
22nd
would’ve
been
a
friday.
saturday
and
sunday
would’ve
intervened
and
he
proposed
and
agreed
to
go
to
trial
on
the
25th
the
following
monday.
so,
the
first
question
that
we
present
to
the
court
is
the
right
of
counsel
and
the
effectiveness
of
counsel
is
the
second
question.
the
third
question
is
another
due
process
question
which
deals
with
the
admissibility
of
a
confession
in
this
case
and
the
fruits
of
the
confession
consisting
of
three
items
or
physical
exhibits
which
are
important
to
the
prosecution
in
the
case.
and
we
finally
submit
that
this
confession
was
submitted
by
the
court
to
the
jury
under
an
incorrect
constitutional
instruction.
now
with
respect
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
defendant
was
arrested
on
the
night
of
september
or
rather
july
the
30th,
1961
when
apparently
he
was
sleeping
in
his
home
in
the
sawmill
quarters
of
a
sawmill
village
in
mississippi.
some
time
that
night
between
the
hours
of
12
and
2
in
the
morning,
this
14
year
old
white
girl
had
been
raped
at
a
time
when
she
had
immediately
before
had
been
seated
in
an
automobile
with
her
17
year
old
white
companion.
the
story
that
she
told
is
that
a
negro
came
up
and
put
a
knife
in
the
window
and
around
the
neck
of
her
companion
who
was
seated
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
car,
she
being
on
the
left
hand
side
of
the
front
sit.
and
after
an
attempt
to
rob
and
after
taking
away
the
knife
and
the
watch
and
wallet
of
her
boyfriend,
he
had
them
drive
a
short
distance
and
then
had
to
get
out
of
the
car
and
had
her
submit
to
a
rape
with
a
boy
lying
on
the
ground,
her
friend
lying
on
the
ground
beside
but
afraid
to
move
or
afraid
to
offer
any
resistance
because
of
the
fact
that
the
accused
had
a
knife.
in
any
event,
this
occurred
between
the
hours
of
12
and
2
on
the
30th
of
july.
now,
from
the
record
it
appears
that
the
sole
reason
for
the
arrest
of
this
defendant
was
because
a
police
dog
which
was
taken
to
the
scene
of
the
alleged
crime
picked
up
a
scent
and
headed
in
the
direction
of
the
sawmill
quarters.
despite
what
the
state
of
mississippi
says
in
its
brief,
that’s
all
of
the
evidence
that
points
to
the
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
of
this
defendant.
not
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
all
in
the
records,
yes
sir.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
there
maybe
more.
i'm
speaking
of
the
record.
you’re
right
mr.
justice
white.
now,
moreover,
it
appears
that
the
accused
or
defendant
in
this
case
was
one
of
maybe
eight
people
or
nine,
i
forget
which,
who
were
picked
up
in
this
dragnet
drawn
over
the
sawmill
quarters.
at
least
as
far
as
the
record
says,
eight
or
nine
other
suspects
were
rounded
up.
now,
with
respect
to
identification
with
which
this
court
is
not
really
concerned
i
supposed,
but
it’s
interesting
that
on
the
trial
of
this
case,
neither
the
prosecutrix
nor
her
friend
ever
identified
or
were
asked
to
identify
the
defendant
accused
who
was
given
a
capital
sentence.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
that
was
--
i
think
the
court
will
find
that
was
with
respect
to
the
testimony
outside
the
presence
of
a
jury
on
the
question
of
admissibility.
i'm
not
sure
about
that
but
i'd
liked
to
look
at
it.
but
at
least,
she
was
never
pointed
out
--
she
never
pointed
out
this
defendant
as
the
person
who
did
commit
the
crime.
now,
with
respect
to
this
defendant,
he
was
arrested
about
4
a.m.in
his
home,
he
was
picked
up
in
this
dragnet.
he
was
taken
to
the
madison
county
jail
in
canton,
mississippi.
and
he
was
held
there
until
11
a.m.
that
is
on
a
sunday
morning.
and
then,
he
was
taken
to
the
hinds
county,
mississippi
patrol
headquarters
and
he
was
held
there
until
a
confession
was
obtained
at
4
o’clock
that
afternoon.
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
we
don’t
know
whether
he
had
breakfast.
we
don’t
know
whether
he
had
lunch.
the
only
thing
the
record
shows
is
that
when
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury,
the
officer
who
had
him
in
custody
was
asked
whether
or
not
he
did
have
breakfast,
he
merely
said
that
breakfast
facilities
were
available
in
the
hinds
county
or
at
the
madison
county
jail.
it
is
almost
apparent
that
he
had
no
sleep.
if
he
were
--
the
fact,
the
person
who
committed
the
crime,
he
would
have
gone
to
bed
around
2
or
2:30.
he
would
have
been
arrested
at
4
and
he
would
have
been
held
without
sleep
certainly
from
the
time
of
his
arrest
until
the
time
that
he
confessed
at
4
o’clock
the
following
afternoon.
his
confession
was
obtained
after
he
says
he
was
accused
--
he
was
told
by
mr.
snodgrass,
one
of
the
officers
under
whose
detention
he
was,
that
if
he
didn’t
confess,
they
were
going
to
take
him
back
to
canton,
madison
county
where
the
crime
had
been
committed
and
let
a
mob
crowd
get
him,
he
used
the
words
mob
crowd.
outside
the
presence
of
a
jury,
the
sheriff
noble
says
of
this
threat,
“i
wasn’t
present
if
he
made
that
statement”
mr.
john,
but
he
didn’t
deny
the
statement
was
made.
he
says
that
he
did
--
wasn’t
present
if
it
were
made.
now,
i
must
candidly
say
that
all
of
the
persons
present
in
the
room
denied
that
there
was
any
coercion
or
any
threat
used
against
this
defendant.
it
is
agreed
that
he
was
put
on
polygraph
machine.
it
is
agreed
that
james
matlock
who
have
been
in
--
riding
around
with
the
accused
before
the
incident
occurred,
that
is
the
rape
occurred,
did
--
was
arrested
at
the
same
time
and
it
was
told
to
the
accused
that
his
accomplice
that
evening
at
least
in
the
robbery
or
the
planned
robbery
had
confessed.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
yes,
i
think
as
far
as
i
know
it
was
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
with
respect
to
that,
the
record
shows
a
very
interesting
colloquy
between
the
defense
counsel
and
james
matlock
who
was
the
companion
of
the
accused
in
this
case.
finally,
it
ends
up
and
he
agrees
that
he
doesn’t
have
sense
enough
to
testify
because
he
testified
one
way
and
testified
another
way
and
finally
just
began
to
give
no
answers
at
all.
the
record
is
right
interesting
in
that
respect.
in
any
event,
after
the
accused
in
this
case,
the
defendant
confessed,
he
was
taken
back
to
his
home
and
there,
a
watch,
a
knife
and
a
pair
of
pants
were
recovered
which
are
physically
exhibits
in
the
court’s
office.
he
was
–
this
were
picked
up
around
6:30
or
7
o’clock
at
night.
now,
a
preliminary
examination
is
required
by
mississippi
law
and
almost
within
the
terms
and
language
of
federal
rule
5
without
unnecessary
delay.
and
it
is
the
duty
of
the
examining
magistrate
to
initiate
a
commitment
proceeding
if
that
should
appear
to
be
required
and
it
is
his
duty
also
in
the
language
of
the
act
to
examine
into
the
case.
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
there
was
no
counsel
at
this
hearing.
he
was
indicted
on
the
20th
of
september,
1961
and
it’s
interesting
to
note
that
this
could
be
a
critical
phase
in
the
defense
of
the
accused
because
the
mississippi
code
says
that
before
swearing
any
grand
jury
as
such,
he
shall
be
examined
by
the
court
on
all
matters
touching
his
qualifications.
after
swearing
in
the
grand
jury,
no
objection
shall
be
raised
and
it
shall
be
presumptively
assumed
that
the
grand
jury
is
properly
empanelled.
now,
this
defendant
was
arraigned
on
the
21st
which
was
a
thursday
of
september,
1961.
on
friday,
the
22nd,
he
--
the
venire
was
drawn
and
counsel
stood
up
in
court
and
said
the
counsel
was
ready
for
trial
in
this
capital
case
on
the
25th
of
september
which
would’ve
been
three
days
later
with
a
saturday
and
sunday
intervening.
now,
the
trial
did
occur
on
the
25th.
no
change
of
venue
was
asked
though
the
statute
of
the
state
of
mississippi
is
very
broad
in
this
respect.
it
says
that
there
can
be
a
change
of
venue
if
there
is
prejudgment
or
ill
will
against
the
defendant
in
the
county
where
the
crime
is
committed.
the
state
at
the
trial
of
the
case
presented
12
witnesses
and
i
think
this
is
important.
one
of
them
was
from
washington,
d.c.
four
of
them
were
from
jackson,
mississippi
which
is
an
adjoining
county
and
because
of
the
language
of
this
court
in
avery
versus
alabama,
i
would
point
out
that
jackson
county
--
hinds
county,
mississippi
is
a
county
of
185,000
people.
seven
witnesses
were
from
madison
county
which
has
a
population
of
33,000
people.
i
might
point
out
that
that
makes
12
witnesses
who
were
presented
by
the
prosecution.
in
addition,
there
was
of
course
the
possibility
of
inquiring
of
many
other
witnesses.
for
example,
what
about
the
man
who
possessed
the
dog?
or
what
would
he
have
said
with
respect
to
the
set
and
where
it
led
him.
but
he
was
never
put
on
the
stand
by
the
prosecution
and
the
defense
never
put
anybody
on
the
stand.
the
defense
only
put
the
accused
on
the
stand
during
the
period
that
the
jury
had
retired
in
order
to
investigate
the
legality
of
the
confession.
now,
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
court
will
find
that
11
times,
attorney
for
the
defense
objected
to
leading
questions
after
they
had
been
answered.
seven
of
those
objections
were
sustained
but
he
never
once
moved
strike
from
the
record
and
the
jury’s
consideration,
the
answers
to
leading
questions
on
which
his
objections
had
been
sustained.
he
failed
to
object
to
a
reference
to
a
confession
prior
to
its
introduction
into
evidence.
and
he
let
pass
the
equation
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
of
the
word
of
white
with
american
when
an
fbi
agent
was
being
examined.
i
say
this
is
not
something
fatal,
but
at
least
gives
a
flavor
of
the
trial.
now
the
defense
counsel
did
file
a
motion
for
new
trial
in
which
he
raised
the
question
of
a
coerced
confession
and
admission
of
certain
items
of
evidence
and
the
case
was
then
taken
to
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
which
found
no
error.
and
then
at
that
stage,
aclu
counsel
came
into
the
case
and
filed
a
suggestion
of
error
which
i
understand
of
the
mississippi
practice,
my
brother
could
tell
me
if
i’m
wrong,
is
equivalent
of
a
motion
for
rehearing
in
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi.
at
that
time,
the
issues
of
the
right
of
counsel,
the
right
to
effective
counsel,
and
the
question
of
unlawful
detention
and
the
proofs
thereof
were
raised.
now,
i
would
like
at
the
outset
of
the
argument
of
the
law
of
this
case
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
one
day
your
honor.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
and
i
might
add
in
respect
to
that,
there
was
half
a
page
of
cross
examination
of
the
prosecutrix
in
this
case.
now,
i
understand
the
problem
in
that
kind
of
a
case
with
a
young
girl,
but
in
any
event,
it
just
indicates
how
fragmentary
and
how
cursory
the
defense
was.
now,
i
say
that
this
case,
in
as
much
as
it
complains
of
the
effectiveness
of
counsel
of
course
presents
to
the
court
a
record
on
which
we
have
to
rely
and
i
think
that
a
court
can
ask
itself
certain
questions
based
upon
the
facts
and
the
clear
inferences
from
this
record.
for
example,
it
would
not
be
normal
i
assume
to
have
in
a
record
where
a
counsel
is
willing
to
go
to
trial
on
the
following
monday
in
a
capital
case
in
objection
by
him
strongly
making
the
point
which
he
didn’t
make
that
an
adjournment
was
necessary.
i
would’ve
thought
it
would’ve
been
rather
difficult
in
as
much
as
you’re
arguing
for
the
effect
--
against
the
effectiveness
of
counsel
for
him
to
have
made
the
point
with
respect
to
the
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
jury.
but
there
are
matters
of
which
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
which
show
the
type
of
exclusion
that
you’ve
got
in
this
case
or
the
point
that
could’ve
been
made.
for
example,
madison
county
is
a
county
of
23,637
negroes.
of
them,
10,366
are
of
the
age
eligible
to
vote.
of
that
group,
only
5.9%
are
registered.
the
county
has
9267
whites
and
of
those,
5622
are
of
voting
age.
the
point
is
that
out
of
that
tremendous
negro
population
which
consists
of
648
--
tens
percent
of
the
county,
only
5.9%
are
registered.
now,
what's
the
importance
of
this?
the
importance
is
precisely
that
importance
which
judge
reeves
in
the
fifth
circuit
pointed
in
the
seal’s
case
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
that
where
as
in
mississippi
at
that
time,
the
whole
construction
of
the
jury
system
depends
and
is
based
upon
the
electorate,
you
can’t
conceivably
have
anything
but
a
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
grand
jury
and
the
petit
jury.
moreover,
the
thing
isn't
built
into
the
system
as
its
presently
operating.
in
1954,
the
mississippi
constitution
was
amended
to
provide
new
methods
of
registration,
with
two
subjective
cases.
does
the
person
who
wished
to
register
understand
the
duties
of
citizenship,
very
subjective?
and
second,
can
he
give
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
constitution?
now,
when
they
passed
this
constitutional
amendment,
they
put
a
grandfather’s
clause
in
it
and
provided
that
all
those
already
registered
could
continue
to
vote
without
re-registration.
now
at
that
time
according
to
mr.
j.p.
coleman,
then
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
mississippi,
there
were
500,000
negroes
of
voting
age
in
1954
when
this
grandfather’s
clause
was
built
in
to
the
system
of
whom
only
22,000
were
eligible
to
vote
or
4.4%
of
the
population.
now
these
are
matters
which
effective
counsel
could’ve
dealt
with
at
the
appropriate
time
in
this
case.
and
counsel
of
course
did
not
make
the
point.
it
is
hardly
likely
in
as
much
as
if
he
wanted
to
plead
for
a
change
of
venue.
it
is
hardly
likely
that
counsel
in
this
case
would’ve
made
the
points
which
have
recently
been
made
at
another
doctrine
of
which
i
think
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice.
the
civil
rights
commission's
report
on
the
state
of
mississippi,
signed
by
[inaudible],
former
president
american
bar
association,
and
erwin
griswold
and
others.
certainly,
some
mentioned
of
this
kind
of
an
in
build
prejudice
in
the
very
system
and
particularly
in
this
county,
it
would
appear
to
me,
it
could've
made
by
effective
counsel.
now,
going
back
specifically
to
the
failure
to
have
counsel
at
the
various
stages
of
this
trial.
he
was
denied
counsel
as
i
say
for
53
days.
the
right
to
counsel
under
the
due
process
clause
does
not
mean
the
right
to
counsel
by
form
only.
i
think
the
court
will
have
to
go
back
to
the
bedrock
case,
powell
versus
alabama
in
which
this
court
said
that
duty
is
not
discharged
by
an
assignment
at
such
time
and
under
such
circumstances
as
to
preclude
the
giving
of
effective
aid
in
the
preparation
and
trial
of
the
case.
the
court
speaks
of
--
from
arraignment
of
trial
beginning
when
consultation,
thorough
going
investigation
and
preparation
were
vitally
important
and
they
called
this
a
critical
phase
of
the
trial.
now,
i
recognize
the
court
has
not
yet
decided
the
case
so
far
as
i
know
which
says
that
counsel
is
needed
or
were
constitutionally
required
at
the
time
of
the
questioning
of
the
accused.
but
if
the
court
will
look
at
its
language
in
crooker,
and
look
at
its
language
in
siena
versus
jay
case,
i
think
the
court
will
agree
that
if
the
failure
to
provide
counsel
at
these
stages
under
the
circumstances,
the
total
circumstances
of
a
case
amounts
to
the
man
not
having
a
fair
trial,
then
there
would
be
a
constitutional
right
of
which
the
accused
would've
been
deprived.
there
are
several
other
cases
i
think
which
go
fairly
far
pointing
in
this
direction.
for
example,
haley
versus
ohio,
in
which
a
15-year
old
negro
was
questioned
in
relays
for
five
hours
and
then,
there
was
a
confession
shown
by
his
accomplices
to
him
and
then
he
was
held
incommunicado
for
three
days
and
the
court
said
that
the
absence
of
an
adult
at
this
stage
voided
the
confession.
now,
here
we
have
an
illiterate
negro,
afraid
of
his
life,
accused
of
what
would
be
in
the
state
of
mississippi
and
in
the
context
there,
the
worst
possible
crime.
held
53
days,
he
was
held
12
hours
before
he
confessed,
there
is
no
real
evidence
that
he
was
fed.
there
is
his
statement
that
he
was
told
that
if
he
didn't
confess,
he
would
be
taken
back
to
the
jail
in
madison
county
where
a
mob
crowd
would
get
him.
he
was
forced
to
submit
to
a
polygraph.
the
accomplice
was
used
against
him.
he
was
in
my
judgment
an
easily
manipulable
man.
and
with
respect
to
the
mob
crowd
in
the
county,
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
the
district
attorney
who
prosecuted
him
filed
to
the
court
a
paper
in
which
he
asked
that
the
defendant
here
be
detained
not
in
madison
county
where
the
crime
was
committed,
but
that
he
be
detained
in
hinds
county
because
he
said,
and
this
is
his
language,
“the
facilities
for
the
safekeeping
of
the
defendant
are
not
available.”
now
mississippi
puts
a
different
construction
on
that
than
--
that
i
had
when
i
immediately
read
it,
but
in
any
event,
there,
the
language
appears.
now
with
respect
to
the
failure
to
grant
this
defendant
counsel
at
his
preliminary
hearing,
i
think
we
must
bear
in
mind
first
of
all
that
the
preliminary
hearing
is
guaranteed
by
state
law
and
it
is
an
important
stage
of
a
hearing
particularly
for
this
man.
there
it
would
have
been
possible
for
counsel
to
have
made
the
judgment
whether
or
not
he
wanted
to
cross
examine
the
state's
witnesses
to
find
out
what
kind
of
a
case
they
had.
it
would've
been
possible
at
that
time
if
the
man
had
his
head
beaten
as
some
of
the
evidence
outside
the
record
demonstrates
in
this
case.
he
could've
been
looked
at
by
the
examining
magistrate.
moreover,
the
officers
who
did
get
his
confession
could've
been
examined
separately
and
each
of
them
put
on
a
record
and
if
there
was
any
confusion
or
any
contradiction,
all
of
these
contradictions
could've
been
used
on
the
cross
examination
of
these
officers
at
the
trial
in
chief.
there
were
four
persons
present
in
that
room
where
he
confessed
and
i'm
reasonably
sure
as
i
am
sure
any
trial
lawyer
would
agree
that
you
would
never
get
all
four
to
say
the
same
thing
and
if
you
had
it
in
the
record,
there
could
have
been
a
more
successful
cross
examination
of
the
persons
who
procured
the
confession.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
do
not
know
what
the
law
is
under
this
--
with
mississippi
your
honor.
that
the
question
i
think
would
be
better
to
be
asked
of
my
brother.
generally
he
--
in
my
practice,
he
would've
been.
in
the
case
of
hamilton
versus
alabama,
this
court
in
1961
said
that
in
the
case
of
alabama,
in
the
state
of
alabama
where
there
was
a
defendant
accused
of
rape
and
the
accused
had
no
lawyer
appointed
for
him
at
the
arraignment.
the
fact
in
that
case,
he
was
prejudiced
so
that
his
constitutional
rights
were
deprived.
now,
it's
interesting
that
the
insanity
plea
in
alabama
could've
been
raised
at
the
arraignment
and
also
the
question
of
the
systematic
exclusion
of
jurors.
certainly
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
at
least
as
far
as
its
law
is
concerned
and
the
case
that
there
has
been
cited
to
us,
it
appeared
that
you
must
challenge
this
grand
jury's
composition
before
it
is
sworn
and
that
would've
occurred
of
course
before
his
indictment.
in
reece
versus
georgia,
this
court
held
in
1955,
that
where
there
was
no
challenge
to
the
grand
jury
before
an
indictment
and
the
accused
had
no
counsel
until
arraignment,
the
court
reversed
when
there
was
evidence
of
the
exclusion
of
negroes.
i
think
that
the
question
with
respect
to
the
time
of
appointment
of
counsel
is
adamantly
and
inexplicably
intertwined
with
the
question
of
the
effectiveness
of
counsel.
this
is
not
avery
versus
alabama
and
i
should
like
to
discuss
that
in
a
moment.
in
avery
versus
alabama
which
was
decided
by
this
court
in
1939,
you
had
a
case
in
which
an
accused
was
arrested
shortly
before
the
31st
of
march
1938,
counsel
was
appointed
on
the
21st
of
march,
1938
and
counsel
put
him
on
trial
or
went
to
trial
on
the
24th.
now
there
are
several
things
that
are
important
about
this.
those
dates
occurred
between
a
monday
and
a
thursday,
not
between
a
friday
and
a
monday,
not
over
the
weekend.
second,
there
were
two
attorneys
appointed
in
that
case,
and
third
as
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
in
his
decision,
there
was
no
suggestion
that
a
better
result
could've
been
obtained
or
a
better
trial
had,
had
there
been
more
time.
furthermore,
as
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
in
that
case,
i
believe
it
was
bibb
county,
alabama,
the
county
seat
had
less
than
a
thousand
persons
in
it
and
the
trial
was
a
trial
of
a
very
simple
shooting
in
which
there
were
almost
no
witnesses.
now,
here
is
the
case
on
the
other
hand
involving
witnesses
in
a
county
of
185,000
people.
the
county
in
which
the
crime
occurred
had
33,000
people.
the
state
presented
12
witnesses.
there
were
numerous
other
witnesses
that
could've
been
presented.
the
appendices
to
the
brief
which
are
not
in
the
record
shows
quite
clearly
i
think
what
might
have
been
presented
by
a
competent
counsel,
if
competent
counsel
--
i
don't
mean
competent,
effective
counsel
had
been
available.
now
your
honors,
under
the
betts
versus
brady
doctrine,
a
system
of
guidelines
with
respect
to
the
right
of
counsel
have
been
established
which
make
the
following
elements
crucial
in
the
court's
consideration
of
the
totality
of
circumstances.
the
first
is
ignorance
of
the
accused.
here,
you've
got
a
functional
illiterate.
there's
a
lack
of
education.
his
familiarity
with
legal
procedures
whether
the
issues
are
complex
or
simple
and
the
atmosphere
of
prejudice.
without
any
question
in
this
case,
the
atmosphere
of
the
prejudice
was
pervasive.
now,
i
turn
to
the
question
with
respect
to
the
confession.
for
in
as
much
as
the
accused
was
never
pointed
out
by
either
the
girl
or
her
companion
as
the
one
who
committed
the
crime,
what
you
have
in
the
case.
you've
got
a
knife,
you've
got
a
timex
watch
and
you've
got
a
pair
of
pants
over
which
there
is
much
controversy,
but
all
of
these
were
obtained
as
a
result
of
the
confession
which
occurred
some
12
hours
after
his
arrest.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
say
that
your
honor
in
view
of
the
following.
first
of
all,
i
take
the
instruction
that
i
make
of
the
district
attorney's
removal
of
the
defendant
from
one
jail
and
putting
him
in
another.
i
also
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
have
no
knowledge
of
it
one
way
or
another
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
the
record
doesn't
help
me
on
it.
the
next
point
i
think
is
your
honor,
the
words
that
i
just
quoted
and
i
could've
quoted
many
others
from
the
civil
rights
commission's
recent
findings
with
respect
to
mississippi
and
the
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
jury
in
the
whole
voting
system.
and
my
feeling
is
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
this
defendant
needed
a
lawyer
perhaps
more
than
most
defendants
because
he
was
a
negro,
he
was
in
a
county
in
which
there
are
64.8%
negroes,
and
moreover,
he
had
been
accused
of
a
crime
then
which
there
was
nothing
worst
of
course.
now
with
respect
to
his
confession,
there
was
much
here
that
was
not
investigated
by
a
counsel.
was
his
head
touched?
was
he
dazed
when
he
was
sent
back
to
his
home
for
picking
up
the
pants
and
the
getting
of
the
knife
and
the
watch?
if
it
could've
been
shown
that
he
had
in
fact
been
beaten,
we
would
have
fallen
under
the
doctrine
of
mapp
versus
ohio.
in
any
event,
an
inquiry
might
have
been
made.
there
isn't
in
my
judgment
anything
in
this
record
which
indicates
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
and
under
the
doctrine
of
the
court
recently
announced
wong
sun
case
where
the
admission
is
obtained
as
the
result
of
an
illegal
arrest,
it
is
not
admissible
and
if
you
tie
the
doctrine
of
wong
sun
versus
--
mapp
versus
ohio,
then
i
think
you
would
exclude
the
fruits
of
the
illegal
detention
and
does
the
illegal
confession.
and
if
you
did
to
exclude
this
confession
and
excluded
the
fruits
that
were
obtained
from
it,
the
state
would
have
had
nothing
that
tied
this
defendant
with
the
crime.
now,
the
final
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
it
that
jury
in
this
case
was
clearly
directed
by
wrong
constitutional
standards.
the
judge
when
he
charged
the
jury,
and
i
must
admit
that
the
charge
was
a
charge
that
was
requested
by
the
defense
counsel,
he
charged
him
as
he
charged
the
jury
as
follows:
the
court
instructs
the
jury
for
the
defendant
that
if
you
believe,
i'm
reading
the
record
at
page
7,
sir.
the
court
instructs
the
jury
for
the
defendant
that
if
you
believe
from
the
evidence
that
the
alleged
confession
wasn't
true,
you
should
disregard
it,
or
if
you
believe
from
the
evidence
that
was
made
under
the
influence
of
hope
or
fear,
you
may
take
this
into
account
in
determining
what
weight
or
credit
if
any,
you
may
attach
to
it
as
evidence.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
that's
exactly
my
point
your
honor.
that's
exactly
my
point.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
it
is
not
the
function
of
the
jury
to
decide
upon
the
admissibility
of
the
confession.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
think
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
it's
the
function
of
the
judge.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
well,
i
would
have
thought
your
honor
that
what
he
was
doing
was
placing
upon
the
jury
a
determination
which
essentially
was
his
and
he
was
sharing
it
to
the
jury.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
he
had
made
the
determination
but
then
he
turned
around
and
says,
“you
may
take
into
account
whether
the
evidence
was
made
or
obtained
under
the
influence
of
hope
or
fear.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
think
your
honor
that
it
is
confusing
the
jury
because
it
permits
the
jury
again
to
pass
on
the
question
of
admissibility,
of
the
confession
to
begin
with.
and
in
any
event
as
the
state
of
mississippi
says
clearly
in
its
brief
that
this
language
is
probably
confusing
but
they
go
on
to
excuse
the
language
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
was
requested
by
the
defendant's
lawyer.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
well,
i
can
see
the
court's
point
about
it
but
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
richmond
case,
the
court
held
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
correct
and
non-confusing
statement
and
i'm
not
sure
whether
in
that
case
the
court
would've
considered
it
beneficial
or
not
beneficial
but
at
least
it
was
considered
to
be
confusing.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
didn't
hear
mr.
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
on
that
point,
that's
right,
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
yes
sir,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
well,
i
can't
--
i
can't
make
that
judgment
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
it's
possible
that
what
you're
saying
may
be
in
fact
true
but
on
the
other
hand,
there
could
be
cases
i
should
suppose
where
the
jury
might
feel
that
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
well,
i
don't
really
know,
i
think
that's
a
tough
question.
i
conclude
now
your
honor
to
save
some
time
with
this.
the
record
in
this
case
is
quite
sufficient
in
showing
the
fact
that
there
was
in
this
case
a
combination
of
total
circumstances
which
made
the
--
this
defendant
subtle
from
the
deprivation
of
due
process
in
respect
to
the
right
of
counsel
at
critical
stages
of
his
trial
and
his
detention
and
right
of
effective
counsel
at
his
trial.
and
he
is
also
i
think
been
deprived
of
his
rights
under
the
due
process
clause
with
regard
to
the
arrest
without
a
probable
cause,
illegal
detention
and
confession
obtained
in
the
fruits
thereof
which
resulted
in
his
conviction.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
say
that
i
have
--
i
had
not
referred
to
the
higgs
matter
and
i
do
not
intend
to
refer
to
it
any
further
except
to
point
out
that
this
is
not
a
case
of
the
state
of
mississippi
versus
higgs
but
state
of
mississippi
versus
smi
--
smith.
now,
with
respect
to
the
use
of
certain
evidence
outside
the
record,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
really
needs
to
go
outside
the
record
to
deal
with
the
main
thrust
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case.
for
when
you
get
down
to
it,
the
main
thrust,
i
think
is
the
reply
that
the
court
would
give
to
these
questions.
why
was
it
necessary
for
mississippi
to
hold
a
man
53
days
and
assign
a
lawyer
so
shortly
before
a
trial?
why
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
your
honor
that
is
out
--
that
of
course
is
outside
the
record.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
yes,
it
is
in
my
affidavit,
but
i
would
point
out
to
you
this,
your
honor,
he
doesn't
say
that
he
was
retained.
he
ac
--
he
is
--
merely
says
that
smith
asked
him
whether
he
would
represent
him
or
asked
him
to
represent
but
there
was
no
suggestion
that
there
was
any
attempt
by
higgs
to
represent
him
until
the
day
when
the
venire
was
called,
which
was
on
the
22nd
of
september.
and
according
to
his
affidavit
he
called
the
judge
and
the
judge
made
it
for
--
proclaimed
to
him
according
to
his
affidavit
that
he
better
not
come.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
he
was
indicted,
your
honor,
on
the
21st.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
20th
and
arraigned
on
the
21st.
and
counsel
announced
ready
on
the
22nd
for
a
trial
on
the
25th.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
yes,
he
was
appointed.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
he
was
appointed
the
day
after
indictment
for
the
purpose
of
standing
with
him
on
arraignment.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
it
makes
--
makes
no
difference,
your
honor.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
would
think
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
that's
right.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
think
he
should
have
had
a
lawyer,
your
honor,
at
the
time
of
his
preliminary
hearing
and
i
think
that
important
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
that
would
have
been
outside
the
record
but
by
newspaper
articles,
on
august
the
3rd.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
this
--
the
arrest
was
on
the
30th
and
the
newspaper
story,
i
will
be
perfectly
candid,
the
story
was
printed
on
the
third
whether
it
referred
to
something
of
the
previous
day
or
not,
i
couldn't
tell
from
reading
the
story,
but
my
point
is
the
record
does
show
that
53
days
without
counsel.
it
does
show
there
was
no
request
for
a
change
of
venue
under
circumstances
here
prevailing.
no
request
for
an
adjournment.
i
conceive
an
answer
to
one
of
the
questions
i
believe
from
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
can't
conceive
of
a
retained
a
lawyer
in
a
capital
case
involving
a
client
known
to
him
not
requesting
a
change
of
venue
but
certainly
a
requesting
an
adjournment
in
a
case
of
this
type
so
that
he
might
have
more
than
a
weekend
for
trial.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
don't
know,
but
a
strong
suggestion
is
that
in
the
judge's
affidavit
that
he
called
him
to
stand
with
him
on
the
arraignment.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
let's
see
what
is
on
the
record.
the
first
thing
that's
on
the
record
is
that
the
appointment
of
counsel
was
certain,
i
think
it's
conceded
no
sooner
than
the
21st.
that
on
the
22nd
he
announced
that
he
was
ready
for
trial
on
the
25th.
there
is
no
question,
but
in
this
case
there
were
no
challenges
to
the
grand
jury,
there
were
no
challenges
to
the
petit
jury,
no
request
for
change
of
venue,
no
request
for
adjournment
and
no
witnesses
were
presented.
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
he
did
not
have
counsel
at
very
critical
stages
of
the
pretrial
investigation
and
of
pretrial
hearings.
now,
while
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
well,
your
honor,
i
am
frank
to
say
i
came
in
the
case
after
the
brief
was
prepared.
i
did
not
--
i
do
not
know
what
the
purpose
of
their
affidavits.
i
think
they
probably
have
some
purpose
but
nevertheless
i
agree
they're
outside
the
record
and
they
look
more
towards
habeas
corpus
than
they
do
to
petition
for
certiorari.
now,
while
we
are
outside
the
record,
i
would
like
to
say
that
mr.
greaves
in
a
letter
which
i
have
here,
mr.
greaves
was
a
trying
a
capital
case
obviously
on
saturday
when
mrs.
jones
tried
to
see
him.
i
think
the
case
is
one
which
clearly
demonstrates
there
wasn't
time
in
this
case
to
try
it.
now
in
answer
of
mr.
justice
black's
question,
the
size
of
the
county
in
which
this
trial
was
held
sir
is
33,000
people.
that's
it.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
sir?
mr.
morris
b.
abram
that
of
the
county
seat.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
yes.
but
the
county
--
i
have
only
the
county
figures,
they
are
approximately
33,000
--
about
23,000
negroes
and
9,000
some
odd
whites.
and
the
population
of
hinds
county
in
which
the
confession
is
obtained
is
a
county
of
a
185,000
people.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
that's
jackson
in
which
jackson
is
located.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
capital
of
the
state,
yes
sir.
now,
i
want
to
make
two
other
observations
then
i'm
through.
the
first
is
that
with
respect
to
the
material
which
appears
outside
the
record
and
which
was
brought
up
by
counsel
opposite
that
there
were
some
negroes
on
the
grand
jury
panel
and
two
negroes
put
on
the
venire
to
hear
this
case,
ought
to
be
struck
--
stricken
in
this
case.
the
recent
case
of
the
fifth
circuit,
the
seals
case,
i
think
is
rather
interesting
on
what
we
mean
or
what
the
courts
mean
by
exclusion.
and
mister
or
rather
judge
reeves
said
this,
“actually,
whether
the
presence
of
a
few
negroes
on
a
venire
containing
many
names
is
evidence
tending
to
prove
or
to
disprove
racial
discrimination,
depends
upon
the
proportions
of
negroes
and
whites
who
are
qualified
for
jury
service.”
citing
reece
versus
georgia,
fairness
and
selection
does
not
require
proportionate
representation
of
races
upon
a
jury
venire.
it
is
nonetheless
true
that
the
very
decided
variations
and
proportions
of
negroes
and
whites
on
jury
list
from
racial
proportions
in
the
population,
which
variations
are
not
explained
in
a
long
continued
furnished
--
efficient
evidence
of
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
jury
service.
and
then
they
--
it
quotes
brown
versus
allen,
“of
course,
token
summoning
of
negroes
for
jury
service
does
not
comply
with
equal
protection.”
and
i
submit
the
competent
counsel
in
this
case
or
rather
effective
counsel
in
this
case
or
counsel
that
had
time
to
prepare
this
case
could
certainly
have
raised
the
question
with
respect
to
systematic
exclusion,
a
case
in
which
the
exclusion
is
in-built,
in
through
and
because
of
the
voting
system.
now
finally,
my
brother
mentioned
that
i
applied
to
make
this
a
mallory
case.
i
want
the
court
to
understand
that
while
i
do
feel
that
the
circumstances
of
this
confession,
having
been
obtained
when
i
presume
that
they
--
could've
been
possible
for
the
state
of
mississippi
to
provide
a
preliminary
examination,
raises
the
issues
of
mallory
but
i
particularly
call
to
the
court's
attention
to
another
issue
and
that
is
that
this
man
was
arrested
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
dog
sniffed
from
the
scene
of
the
incident
into
the
sawmill
quarters
and
the
words
in
the
record
are,
“he
took
the
truck
and
headed
west
and
crossed
the
cotton
field
in
the
direction
of
the
sawmill
quarters.”
mr.
morris
b.
abram
we
don't
know
what
happened
after
that
but
we
do
know
from
the
record
that
eight
or
nine
other
suspects
were
rounded
up.
now,
if
there
were
no
probable
cause,
what
the
state
of
mississippi
has
done
here
is
to
arrest
a
group
of
people
who
happen
to
live
in
a
certain
section
of
town
and
have
obtained
from
one
a
confession
under
the
circumstances
that
we've
already
described
and
i
suggest
this
is
not
probable
cause,
the
detention
was
without
probable
cause.
the
confession
resulted
from
that
illegal
detention
and
illegal
arrest,
just
as
much
as
it
if
it
were
a
material
seized
without
a
search
warrant.
the
whole
fruit
of
the
investigation
is
suspect
and
poisonous
and
consequently
the
confession
is
of
no
use
in
a
constitutional
sense.
thank
you
sir.
