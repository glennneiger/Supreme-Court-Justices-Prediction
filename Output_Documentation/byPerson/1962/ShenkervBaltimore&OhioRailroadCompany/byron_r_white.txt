mr.
wright,
what
is
[inaudible]
is
rehearing
allowed
to
be
controlled
by
the
pan
--
original
panel?
do
you
say
there
are
some
instances?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
rule
33
of
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
just
those
three?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
this
--
is
this
the
situation
you
were
talking
about
when
you
said
that
if
two
out
of
the
three
of
the
original
panel
should
--
can
be
delegated
the
power
to
grant
a
rehearing
so
should
the
four
out
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
granted
--
that
if
--
if
it's
granted,
it
doesn't
go
to
the
whole
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
isn't
much
you
can
do
about
that
on
the
street
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
control
other
drivers
but
there's
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
by
the
stuck
door.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
--
would
you
say
that
if
this
had
been
a
b&o
car
that
you'll
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
set
before
the
first
instance,
the
first
time
this
car
had
ever
come
through
this
town.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
fellow
never
been
on
that
car
before
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
more
(voice
overlap)
--
what
more
duties
does
b&o
got
to
inspect
its
own
car
than
some
other
cars
having
an
employee
working
on
it
or
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
chances
it
got
to
discover
that
stuck
door
on
its
own
cars
than
in
somebody
else's
cars?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
both
the
baggage
man,
the
p&le
baggage
man
and
the
petitioner
were
injured
by
the
same
stuck
door
at
the
same
time.
now,
can
you
say
that
one
could
recover
and
the
other
shouldn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that's
--
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
there
was
a
--
suppose
the
p&le
should've
known
that
the
door
is
fixed.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
they
shouldn't
stick?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
instructions
in
this
case
were
adequate,
you
think
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
think
it
should've
been
--
had
gone
to
the
jury
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
not
asking
or
urging
any
error
of
the
law
are
you,
in
the
instructions
or
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
really
what
you're
saying
is
that
there's
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
this
record
to
sustain
the
finding
that
the
railroad
failed
in
its
duty
of
exercising
reasonable
care?
