mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
f.
e.
l.
a.
case
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed
a
judgment
for
the
injured
employee.
it
raises
two
questions;
one,
a
question
of
federal
appellate
procedure,
the
other
question
of
law
as
to
the
scope
of
the
duty
of
the
carrier
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
since
the
two
questions
are
independent,
i
should
like
to
express
my
view
on
the
procedural
question
before
stating
the
facts
which
go
to
the
merits
and
to
the
rule
of
law
involved.
in
the
third
circuit,
the
judgment
for
the
employee
was
reversed
by
vote
of
2
to
1.
judge
goodrich
and
judge
ganey
with
the
majority
and
judge
kalodner
dissented.
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
was
filed.
the
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
comes
not
under
rule
33
of
the
third
circuit
as
respondent
suggests
in
his
brief
and
under
rule
4
(c)
of
the
third
circuit
which
deals
with
their
en
banc
procedure.
the
petition
was
ruled
denied
per
goodrich
and
ganey
j.
with
four
justices
dissenting
from
the
denial
of
rehearing,
judge
kalodner,
judge
biggs,
judge
smith
and
judge
staley.
judges
hasty
and
mclaughlin
of
the
third
circuit
did
not
participate
in
ruling
on
the
motion
for
rehearing.
and
so
as
the
matter
stood,
the
vote
was
4
to
2
in
favor
of
granting
rehearing
but
the
statute,
section
46
(c)
of
the
judicial
code
provides
that
rehearing
en
banc
maybe
ordered
by
a
majority
of
the
circuit
judges
in
active
service.
and
since
there
were
eight
judges
in
active
service
on
the
court
at
that
time,
the
court
considered
that
the
petition
for
rehearing
had
failed
to
attain
the
necessary
majority
and
therefore
it
ruled
that
the
petition
was
denied.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there's
no
indication
whatever,
justice
stewart.
we
concede
that
the
--
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute
supports
what
was
done
below.
it
is
true
that
there
was
not
a
majority
of
the
circuit
judges
in
active
service
who
voted
to
grant
the
petition.
we
suggest,
however,
that
this
is
a
statute
which
had
never
been
read
literally
either
by
this
court
or
any
other
court
and
it
is
a
statute
which
read
literally
in
this
context,
produces
an
absurd
result.
it
produces
the
result
that
one
loses
though
two-thirds
of
the
judges
who
vote
on
the
matter
who
voted
in
one's
favor.
i
have
endeavored,
i
must
say
without
success
to
formulate
some
principle
of
one-judge-one-vote
which
might
applicable
to
the
case.
i
do
suggest,
however,
that
the
principle
of
majority
rule
is
not
a
principle
confined
to
southern
primaries,
but
it's
one
which
the
federal
courts
have
always
followed.
i
will
not
say
that
what
happened
below
is
unprecedented
because
there
may
always
be
a
precedent
which
has
been
overlooked,
but
so
far
as
i
can
find
in
following
the
work
of
the
federal
courts,
i
cannot
recall
any
case
in
which
a
majority
of
the
sitting
judges
have
been
held
to
not
to
have
their
way
on
a
matter
before
the
court.
the
closest
case
i
can
think
of
in
point
as
the
case
here
of
in
re
isserman
in
which
in
order
to
show
cause
why
isserman
should
not
be
disbarred
was
served
upon
him.
the
court
divided
4
to
4
as
to
whether
he
had
shown
cause
and
this
court
initially
ruled
that
he'd
failed
to
carry
majority
and
he
was
disbarred.
but
this
court
then
proceeded
to
change
its
rules
to
prevent
such
a
result
and
on
rehearing,
permitted
isserman
to
remain
a
member
of
the
bar.
this
court
when
it
first
construed
the
en
banc
statute,
section
46
(c)
indicated
that
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute
does
not
require,
when
it
suggested
specifically
as
a
possible
procedure
which
the
circuits
might
follow,
that
they
might
leave
it
to
the
original
panel
to
decide
whether
or
not
a
rehearing
en
banc
should
be
called
for.
if
one
does
this,
then
two
judges
can
order
a
rehearing
en
banc
even
though
the
statute
says
a
majority
of
the
judges
in
active
service.
now,
if
we
can
read
the
statute
in
a
non-literal
sense
and
permit
the
panel
to
decide,
it
is
our
view
that
we
can
also
read
the
statute
in
a
non-literal
sense
and
permit
those
judges
who
participate
to
decide.
when
six
judges
participate
or
don't
think
rehearing
should
be
granted
that
it
would
be
entirely
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
statute
to
order
rehearing
and
in
fact
in
my
submission
to
deny
rehearing
on
showing
of
this
kind
[inaudible]
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
statute
we
have
been
told
is
intended
to
make
sure
that
a
majority
of
the
active
judges
may
determine
the
major
doctrinal
trends
for
their
circuit.
now
this
will
not
occur
if
--
when
half
of
the
judges
in
the
court
and
a
majority
of
those
participated
are
unsatisfied
with
the
decision
or
want
to
hear
more
about
it
before
they
let
it
stand,
to
sit
the
doctrinal
trends
for
their
circuit,
nevertheless
the
decision
has
to
stand.
and
it's
for
those
reasons
that
we
think
that
the
court
below
erred
when
it
entered
its
order
rehearing
denied
with
a
vote
of
4
to
2
to
grant
rehearing,
the
order
should
have
been,
rehearing
granted.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
is
that
this
court
has
emphasized
in
western
pacific
case
that
the
statute
is
addressed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
litigants
may
suggest
the
rehearing
en
banc
but
they
get
no
vested
rights
from
it.
at
the
same
time,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
matter
of
peculiar
concern
of
the
litigant
when
the
resulting
judgment
comes,
that
the
litigant
is
partly
aggrieved
by
a
judgment
which
we
consider
legally
to
be
erroneous.
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is
within
the
permissible
discretion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
to
say
that
a
minority
should
rule.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
did.
the
rule
of
the
third
circuit
will
foresee
as
--
except
for
a
slight
verbal
change
identical
with
the
statute.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
literal
language?
i
agree.
it
requires
the
result.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
mr.
judge
white.
under
rule
33
if
a
petition
for
a
rehearing
to
the
original
panel
and
it
sits
out
a
variety
of
circumstances
under
which
the
original
panel
might
itself
grant
a
rehearing
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
third
circuit.
those
three
judges
could
decide
if
they
want
to
rehear
the
matter
but
they
weren't
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
the
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
rule
33?
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
think
so,
mr.
justice
brennan,
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
mr.
justice
white.
this
is
not
the
situation
i'm
talking
about.
under
the
western
pacific
case,
what
can
be
done
and
what
in
fact
at
least
the
eighth
circuit
has
done
is
to
provide
that
applications
for
rehearing
en
banc
shall
be
considered
by
the
original
panel
and
if
it
votes
for
rehearing
en
banc,
then
the
whole
court
hears
the
case.
if
it
is
denied
then
it's
denied.
the
matter
never
goes
to
the
whole
court.
this
is
not
the
third
circuit
in
effect.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
your
honor.
on
the
merits
of
the
case
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
is
it.
if
i
am
right
on
this
point
and
if
the
court
chooses
to
decide
the
case
on
this
point,
i
would
suppose
the
court
would
remand
to
the
third
circuit
to
vote
a
rehearing.
i
think
however,
it
is
within
the
power
of
this
court
whether
i'm
right
or
wrong
on
the
rehearing
point
to
decide
the
case
on
the
merits.
this
is
not
a
case
where
federalism
intrudes
and
the
state
court
must
be
given
the
first
crack.
here,
this
court
can
do
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
that's
what
happened
in
the
drake
bakeries
case
when
it
came
here.
it
came
here
both
on
the
question
of
rehearing
and
on
a
difficult
question
on
the
merits.
the
court
decided
the
case
on
the
merits
and
in
the
footnotes
that
we
do
not
pass
on
the
question
of
rehearing
that
was
presented.
on
the
merits,
the
petitioner
was
a
baggage
man
with
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad,
employed
at
its
station
in
new
castle,
pennsylvania.
at
that
point,
the
tracks
of
the
baltimore
and
ohio
and
the
tracks
of
the
pittsburgh
and
lake
erie
are
adjacent.
the
pittsburgh
and
lake
erie
has
no
employees
at
that
point.
it
has
a
building
but
once
a
station,
but
as
of
the
time
when
this
accident
occurred,
pittsburgh
and
lake
erie
passengers
bought
their
tickets
from
the
b&o
ticket
agent.
and
b&o
employees
such
as
petitioner
did
what
service
was
necessary
for
pittsburgh
and
lake
erie
trains,
including
in
this
case,
loading
mail
onto
the
train.
the
petitioner
was
injured,
a
severe
back
injury
requiring
a
laminectomy
when
a
pittsburgh
and
lake
erie
train,
operating
on
pittsburgh
and
lake
erie
tracks
stopped,
he
endeavored
to
put
the
mail
on,
the
door
of
the
car
would
not
open
more
than
some
18
to
24
inches.
the
sacks
of
mail
are
quite
large,
31
by
37
inches
and
weighing
up
to
100
pounds
and
endeavoring
to
force
these
bags
through
the
narrow
opening,
he
injured
his
back.
there
is,
as
i
understand
no
dispute
but
that
the
car
was
defective
in
this
regard
and
there
was
testimony
that
a
p&le
employee
had
earlier
reported
the
defect
to
the
p&le
but
that
nothing
had
been
done.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that's
all
we
have.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
is
correct.
the
only
thing
in
addition
which
we
have,
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
p&le
cars
were
serviced
by
the
b&o
under
an
arrangement
between
the
railroads
and
this
allegation
was
admitted.
but
we
do
not
know
what
the
arrangement
was
in
any
respect
and
on
our
view
of
this
case
--
the
arrangement
is
entirely
immaterial.
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
there
was
a
contract
or
no.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
if
petitioner
had
been
a
volunteer,
yes
it
was,
but
petitioner
clearly,
the
record
shows
petitioner
was
doing
this
under
instructions
from
his
b&o
supervisors.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
this
was
part
of
the
duties
which
his
employer
had
required
him
to
perform.
the
court
--
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
this
was
a
problem
of
agency
of
imputed
negligence
and
it
held
that
since
the
p&le
was
not
the
agent
of
the
b&o
that
there
could
be
no
imputation
of
any
negligence
at
the
p&le
to
the
b&o
and
therefore
no
recovery.
now,
i
take
it
that
the
parties
are
aggrieved
as
i
read
the
brief,
but
this
is
not
a
proper
approach
of
the
case.
at
page
20
of
his
brief,
respondent
says
that
it
wholeheartedly
agrees
with
our
formulation
which
states
that
there
is
no
such
agency
issue
or
issue
of
imputed
negligence
here.
our
position
is
as
simple.
we
say
we
are
concerned
with
negligence
of
the
pittsburgh
and
lake
erie.
we
are
concerned
only
with
negligence
of
the
baltimore
and
ohio,
petitioner's
employer.
and
we
believe
that
here
the
baltimore
and
ohio
was
negligent.
that
it
breached
its
duty
to
provide
--
reasonable
care
in
providing
a
safe
place
to
work.
now,
respondent
agrees
also
with
us
and
the
cases
here,
bailey
v.
central
vermont
and
ellis
v.
union
pacific
certainly
required
this
that
there
is
such
a
duty
on
the
employer-carrier.
that
the
--
even
when
the
employee
is
sent
to
work
on
the
cars
or
track
or
equipment
of
another
line
that
the
employer
is
still
under
a
continuing
non-delegable
duty
to
exercise
reasonable
care
to
see
that
the
employee
has
a
safe
place
to
work.
thus
far,
we
are
on
common
ground.
petitioner
and
respondent
disagree
however
when
we
go
beyond
this
to
ask
what
this
duty
means
in
a
concrete
case.
respondent
analyzes
cases
and
groups
them
and
suggests
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
employer-carrier
can
be
liable
where
the
defect
was
not
on
his
own
premises.
only
if
the
employer
had
created
the
defect
or
had
actual
knowledge
of
the
defect,
or
the
defect
was
permanent
or
of
such
a
long
standing
nature
that
he
should
have
had
knowledge.
this
it
seems
to
me
is
familiar
and
quite
proper
technique
in
case
analysis
that
one
can
distinguish
all
the
cases
and
find
there
has
never
been
a
case
in
which
recovery
has
been
allowed
for
a
red-haired
switchman
killed
in
a
head-on
collision
and
clearly
there
can
be
no
such
recovery
when
that
case
arises.
i'm
going
to
suggest
that
the
law
of
negligence
is
too
supple
and
too
vital
to
be
thus
departmental
on
this,
but
before
i
discuss
what
seems
to
me
the
applicable
principle
i
should
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
precedents.
in
order
to
develop
the
rule
of
law
which
respondent
contends,
it
is
necessary
that
they
do
some
violence
to
the
present,
thus
they
are
required
to
categorize
a
case
in
which
the
employee
was
injured
because
he
fell
in
snow
and
ice
as
case
of
a
permanent
or
long
standing
defect.
and
to
categorize
similarly,
a
case
in
which
a
rainstorm,
the
night
before
had
caused
ashes
to
accumulate
in
an
unhappy
fashion
which
led
to
an
accident,
this
they
say
are
permanent
or
long
standing
defects.
at
page
22
of
their
brief,
they
write
off
four
of
the
precedents
on
the
ground
that
these
are
cases
like
sinkler
v.
missouri
pacific,
cases
in
which
the
third
party
was
performing
operational
activities
and
therefore
the
negligence
of
the
third
party
is
to
be
imputed
to
the
employer.
but
this
i
suggest
would
come
as
a
great
surprise
to
the
courts
which
decided
there
were
four
cases
and
three
of
them
--
there
is
not
a
word
of
operational
activities
or
of
imputed
negligence.
and
on
the
fourth,
mr.
hadden's
case
of
a
payne
v.
baltimore
and
ohio,
imputed
negligence
was
clearly
put
forward
only
as
an
alternative
ground
of
decision.
finally,
in
connection
with
precedence,
the
categorization
which
respondent
makes
requires
a
somewhat
heavy
handed
treatment
if
i
may
say
so
of
harris
v.
pennsylvania
railroad
which
is
the
only
case
from
this
court
which
comes
close
to
the
facts
of
our
case.
in
the
harris
case,
harris
was
a
pennsylvania
railroad
employee.
he
was
a
member
of
a
wreck
crew
and
was
sent
out
to
help
derail
some
cars
which
had
--
to
help
re-rail
some
cars
which
have
been
derailed
on
the
nickel
plate.
in
the
course
of
doing
so,
he
slipped
because
of
grease,
so
it
was
said
on
a
nickel
plate
tie.
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record,
whatever
that
the
pennsylvania
railroad
or
any
employee
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
had
any
knowledge
that
the
grease
was
there.
nevertheless,
it
was
held
that
there
could
be
recovery.
now
in
the
trial
court,
harris
alleged
four
grounds
of
negligence.
but
the
jury
found
that
pennsylvania
was
negligent
in
only
one
ground,
that
there
had
been
grease
on
the
tie
and
this
was
not
a
reasonably
safe
place
to
work.
the
ohio
supreme
court
announced
that
as
a
matter
of
ohio
procedure
when
the
jury
finds
that
a
defendant
is
negligent
on
one
ground
and
the
same
one
as
to
others,
this
rejects
the
other
grounds.
because
one
of
the
other
grounds
had
been
that
he
can
require
to
do
this
work,
but
then
a
pennsylvania
foreman
in
there
and
he
said,
“this
is
too
hard
a
job
for
me”
and
the
pennsylvania
foreman
said,
“you're
a
big
boy.”
this
has
been
a
ground
of
negligence
but
the
jury
hadn't
found
it
as
such.
and
the
higher
supreme
court
said,
“we
cannot
consider
this
ground
because
the
jury
has
impliedly
rejected”
and
it
also
found
insufficient
evidence
of
grease
and
oil
and
reversed.
the
case
came
here
and
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
first
question
put
forward
on
behalf
of
paris
was
that
the
ohio
special
interrogatory
practice
deprives
workers
of
the
rights
under
f.
e.
l.
a.
and
should
not
be
applicable
in
f.
e.
l.
a.
cases.
the
second
point
put
forward
was
that
there
was
evidence
to
support
the
finding,
the
foreman
shouldn't
have
made
him
do
all
this
work.
and
finally,
the
point
was
made
that
there
was
evidence
to
support
that
the
grease
on
the
tie
count.
this
court
reversing
the
ohio
supreme
court
reinstating
the
verdict,
expressly
rested
its
decision
that
on
a
holding
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
find
the
employer
negligent
because
of
the
grease
and
oil
in
the
nickel
plate
tie
and
this
court
expressly
also
said,
“we
therefore
do
not
consider
the
challenge
to
the
ohio
interrogatory
practice.”
so
that
the
explanation
of
harris
which
my
learned
friend
gives
that
for
basis
of
liability
there
was
that
there
was
pennsylvania
foreman
who
knew
about
this
is
not
the
basis
which
prevailed
in
this
court.
there's
no
evidence
that
the
pennsylvania
foreman
knew
about
it.
and
my
view
to
the
harris
case
in
fact
goes
further
than
we
are
asking
the
court
to
go
here
because
in
harris
there
was
no
evidence
even,
so
far
as
i
can
tell,
that
the
railroad
might
plan
an
inspection
and
discover
the
grease.
what
happens
--
there
was
whether
the
section
man
inspected
the
next
morning
and
found
no
grease.
nevertheless,
recovery
was
allowed
in
harris.
here,
there
is
evidence
that
the
defect
had
existed
for
some
period
of
time
sufficient
for
a
court
to
have
been
made
and
most
of
this
is
not
a
new
threat
to
safety
but
something
which
inspection
by
the
baltimore
and
ohio
would
have
disclosed.
now,
return
from
--
yes?
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
distinguish
mr.
justice
goldberg,
between
foreseeability
and
notice.
as
i
understand
the
law
of
negligence,
foreseeability
relates
to
whether
the
defendant
could
have
foreseen
that
the
condition
which
existed
might
give
rise
to
injury
if
he
had
had
all
the
facts
about,
notice
is
whether
he
had
or
recently
should
have
had
all
the
facts.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
foreseeability
problem
here
if
the
railroad
had
known
that
the
door
would
not
have
opened,
it
could
have
foreseen
that
injury
might
result.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
i
do
not
find
a
foreseeability
issue
here.
i
think
there
is
perhaps
a
notice
issue.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
sir
they
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
baggage
man
on
the
p&le
car
--
a
p&le
employee
said
to
shenker
just
before
he
was
injured
that
--
i
--
that
he
had
reported
this
defect
to
the
railroad,
but
nothing
had
happened.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
to
the
p&le.
and
the
principle
which
i
suggest
should
be
governing
in
these
cases
is
that
the
duty
of
the
employer,
one
whose
employee
is
working
on
the
premises
of
some
third
party
is
exactly
the
same
as
his
duty
when
the
employee
is
working
on
home
rails.
that
if
the
employer
would
be
liable,
that
the
injury
had
occurred
on
a
b&o
train
or
a
b&o
car
then
the
employer
is
also
liable
when
he
requires
his
employee
to
go
out
and
service
a
p&le
car.
this
is
what
the
jury
was
charged
as
i
understand
it
in
this
case
and
neither
side
objects
the
charge
and
both
sides
have
said
that
the
charge
was
an
act
or
statement
of
the
law.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
well,
i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
so,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
--
it
would
be
a
clearer
case
that
the
b&o
should
have
found
out
the
defect
that
the
defect
might
have
occurred
for
any
cause,
the
defect
may
very
well
occur
without
the
negligence
of
anyone.
the
negligence
comes
in
failing
to
find
the
defect,
do
something
about
it,
warn
the
employee
against
the
dangers.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
of
course
it's
not
the
case
and
they
--
the
principle
for
which
i
contend
is
that
the
employer-carrier,
if
it's
going
to
send
its
employees
to
work
on
other
lines,
has
to
exercise
the
same
precaution.
b&o
cars
presumably
are
routinely
inspected
by
the
b&o.
if
it's
going
to
send
its
man
over
to
work
on
a
p&le
car
then
i
suggest
that
it
is
under
a
duty
by
inspection
or
otherwise
to
make
sure
that
it
is
not
exposing
its
employee
to
undue
risk.
and
this,
i
think
is
fully
supported
by
the
cases
--
i
agree
that
the
cases
are
not
from
this
court.
there
is
a
substantial
body
of
case
law
from
the
state
courts
and
from
the
court
of
appeals
cited
in
our
brief
that
there
is
a
duty
on
an
employer
who
sends
his
employee
elsewhere
to
inspect,
he
must
inspect
the
tracks
or
the
equipment
or
whatever
it
is,
plans
to
send
the
employee
off
to
work.
and
this
i
think
is
what
was
meant
when
the
trial
judge
charged
the
jury,
that
the
employer's
duty
was
to
furnish
employees
with
reasonably
safe
course,
appliances,
and
equipment
regardless
of
who
owns
them
and
where
they
might
be
located.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
the
instructions
are
not
in
the
printed
transcript,
mr.
justice
goldberg
for
the
reason
which
counsel
for
respondent
explained
at
page
20
of
his
brief.
neither
side
accepted
the
instructions.
they
therefore
were
not
a
part
of
the
printed
record
in
either
the
court
below
or
here.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
both
sides
agree
that
the
case
was
adequately
submitted
in
the
instructions.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i'm
embarrassed
sir
to
say
that
i
do
not
have
the
copy
myself.
the
clerk
for
the
third
circuit,
ms.
crescoff,
when
i
requested
a
copy
said
that
she
would
make
a
copy
available
only
on
order
from
this
court.
so
the
court
can
get
them
and
the
counsel
can't.
now,
if
the
principle
for
which
i
have
contended
is
sound
then
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
no
difficulty
in
applying
it
in
this
case.
if
the
baltimore
and
ohio
exercise
reasonable
care
to
see
that
shenker
was
not
required
to
work
in
an
unsafe
place,
the
answer
as
the
record
shows
is
that
baltimore
and
ohio
did
nothing.
in
fact,
this
is
the
principal
argument
which
the
railroad
makes
as
to
why
it
should
be
exonerated
from
liability.
it's
said,
“we
had
no
one
there
to
make
an
inspection
with
nobody
around
except
shenker.”
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
railroad
did
or
failed
to
do
which
is
enough
to
impose
liability
on
them,
that
the
railroad
took
no
precaution
whatever.
it
had
no
way
of
knowing
whether
or
not
the
cars
that
shenker
was
required
to
service
are
going
to
be
safe
or
whether
they're
going
to
be
lethally
dangerous.
it
took
no
step
to
protect
the
safety
of
its
employee
and
the
jury
therefore
quite
properly
found,
i
suggest,
that
the
railroad
was
liable.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
do
not,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
that
if
a
p&le
employee
had
been
injured
here
because
of
some
defect
and
the
mail
truck
perhaps
of
the
b&o
then
we
would
have
sinkler
type
case.
but
here,
the
b&o
was
performing
activities
for
the
benefit
of
the
p&le
and
that
was
the
situation
in
sinkler,
where
the
belt
terminal
was
doing
the
switching
for
the
missouri
pacific.
but
i
think
that
this
is
the
exact
reverse
of
the
sinkler
case.
i
think
the
sinkler
principle
is
of
vital
importance
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
as
i
understand
the
sinkler
case
that
the
court
there
gave
what
it
called
an
accommodating
scope
to
the
word
agents
in
the
act
in
ordered
to
assure
--
ensure
that
a
railroad
cannot
escape
its
duties
under
the
acts
simply
by
hiring
somebody
else,
probably
an
independent
contractor
to
do
part
of
its
work.
and
what
we
are
contending
for
here
is
that
a
railroad
should
not
be
able
to
escape
its
duties
under
the
act
by
sending
its
employees
to
go
work
another
railroad.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
cannot
believe
so.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
if
the
court
please,
i
have
only
three
points
i
wish
to
make
in
rebuttal.
i
was
surprised
by
counsel's
suggestion
that
the
charge
to
the
jury
in
his
view
did
not
state
the
correct
test
of
legal
liability.
as
is
already
been
mentioned,
there
was
no
exception
taken
to
the
charge
by
either
side
of
the
conclusion
of
the
charge.
the
trial
judge
said,
“gentlemen,
have
i
misstated
anything?”
counsel
for
the
defendant
said,
“no.”
this
afternoon
in
this
court
is
his
--
the
first
suggestion
i've
heard,
the
charge
was
inaccurate
or
the
judge
did
not
give
a
quick
test
of
legal
liability
to
the
court.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
wouldn't
think
that
the
appeals
did
--
much
chance
of
success.
i
appreciate
mr.
hadden's
willingness
to
spell
out
legal
arguments
by
which
it
might
have
been
found
to
be
an
employee
of
the
p&le
but
this
argument
seemed
to
me
not
at
all
firmly
based.
the
argument
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
i
think
--
we
did
not
think
it
would
win.
we
think
that
an
employee
does
not
need
to
rely
on
such
as
[inaudible]
as
the
loan
servant
doctrine
or
the
operational
activities
doctrine
that
he
is
entitled
to
look
to
his
employer.
employer
sends
him
some
place
else
and
he's
hurt,
his
employer
should
pay.
finally,
i'm
strongly
tempted
by
mr.
hadden's
invitation
that
i
stand
up
here
and
say
what
the
baltimore
and
ohio
could
have
done.
as
an
interested
student
of
the
railroads,
i
would
enjoy
telling
the
baltimore
and
ohio
would've
--
could've
done
but
i
think
it
knows
much
better
than
i
what
might
have
been
done.
it
certainly
could
have
inspected.
it
could
have
had
a
supervisory
employee
there
who
--
when
he
heard
the
p&le
baggage
man
say
this
door
won't
open.
i've
tried
to
get
it
fixed
and
it
hasn't
been
fixed.
he
could've
said,
“shenker,
no,
do
not
work
on
this
car.”
it
could
have
issued
instructions
to
its
employees
that
they
were
not
required
to
service
equipment
which
was
found
to
be
defective.
now,
if
the
–
if
the
duty
here
is
a
hard
one
on
the
baltimore
and
ohio,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
risk
it
takes
when
it
sends
its
employee
elsewhere.
it's
quite
obviously
as
in
a
better
position
to
control
the
condition
of
its
own
cars
in
its
own
premises
than
it
is
there
is
of
another
carrier,
but
it
assumes
that
risk
when
it
enters
into
some
arrangement
we
know
not
what
to
service
the
other
carrier.
and
so,
in
my
view,
the
correct
principle
is
that
it
was
stated
by
the
sixth
circuit
on
the
case
of
payne
v.
baltimore
and
ohio,
where
it
said
when
the
employer
delegates
its
duty
or
abdicates
its
control,
the
employer
takes
the
risk,
not
the
employee.
it
seems
to
me
that
here,
if
there
was
a
risk
involved
and
it
was
hard
for
the
b&o
but
that's
just
what
the
b&o
asked
for.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
only
a
very
few
minutes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
perhaps
two
or
three
minutes
before
he
loaded
it
and
maybe
five
minutes
in
all
as
i
understand
the
record.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
gather
that
it
was
from
this
number
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
a
mail
car,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
the
record
is
silent
on
that
point.
