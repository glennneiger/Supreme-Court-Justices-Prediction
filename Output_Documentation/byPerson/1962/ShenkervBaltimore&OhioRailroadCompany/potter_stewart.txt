justice
potter
stewart
is
there
indication
as
to
why
two
of
the
judges
did
not
participate?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
this
a
matter
that
the
--
if
the
judiciary
was
in
the
--
within
the
internal
housekeeping
management
of
each
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
did
it
--
this
did
follow
the
rule
of
the
third
circuit,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
does
as
you
began
by
saying
follow
the
literal
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
--
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
just
before
we
leave
this,
what
--
what
if
you're
right
on
this
point,
supposedly
it
wouldn't
reach
the
merits
of
the
case,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
that
means,
i
suppose
that
your
first
point,
the
point
you've
discussed
up
to
now
becomes
to
be
theoretical?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
a
test
whether
a
reasonable
man
in
the
exercise
of
ordinary
prudence
would
have
foreseen
rather
than
whether
the
defendant
could
have
foreseen?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
talking
now
about
the
foreseeability.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you'd
have
an
entirely
different
case
if
it's
been
a
b&o
car
because
then
the
defect
in
the
door
would
have
been
the
responsibility
--
it
would've
resulted
from
the
negligence
of
the
b&o,
the
employer.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
b&o
car
would
have
been
within
the
exclusive
control
of
the
employer,
the
defendant
in
this
case
where
the
p&le
car
that
--
this
is
just
not
the
case,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
harris?
justice
potter
stewart
the
ohio
supreme
court,
i
have
it
here,
160
ohio
state.
first
of
all,
it
stated
the
ohio
rule
that
in
answer
--
that
there
was
negligence
of
--
under
one
specification,
it
was
an
implicit
rejection
of
the
other
specifications
for
negligence
and
then
said
that
what
the
case
had
to
do
with
is
whether
--
whether
the
defendant
railroad
had
the
duty
of
going
over
the
premises
of
another
railroad
was
applying
to
have
come
to
discover
every
imperfection
thereon
before
sending
its
employees
there
to
do
the
job
which
they've
been
trained
and
so
on
and
so
forth
which
would
--
and
that
reasoning
was
certainly
rejected
wasn't
it
by
this
court
it
reversed
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
harris
says
there
are
two
interrogatories
herewith.
the
first
one,
was
the
defendant
negligent,
yes,
this
pennsylvania
railroad.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
i
understand
it,
the
work
was
being
done
on
that
--
on
the
line
of
another
railroad
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
a
pennsylvania
railroad
employee.
and
then
the
second
interrogatory
is
if
your
answer
to
number
one
is
yes,
state
what
that
negligent
consist
--
negligence
consisted
and
the
answer
just
was
that
the
tie
was
elevated
and
covered
with
grease
and
mud.
somebody
had
a
duty
to
know
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
the
employer,
the
pennsylvania
had
a
duty
to
know
about
it
or
else
the
negligence
couldn't
have
existed
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
the
case
couldn't
have
been
reversed
by
this
court.
justice
potter
stewart
indicate
that
the
defendant
railroad
didn't
know
about
this.
justice
potter
stewart
because
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff
himself
knew
in
advance
that
this
was
not
--
this
is
an
overt
defect,
wasn't
it,
an
open
defect,
the
stuck
door,
the
plaintiff
himself?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
as
contra
--
i'm
talking
about
this
present
case
not
harris
and
harris
i
suppose
they
didn't
see
it
until
the
accident
happened,
but
in
the
present
case,
the
plaintiff
knew
all
about
the
fact
this
door
was
stuck,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
wondered
if
you
did.
justice
potter
stewart
do
the
--
does
the
--
how
--
did
it
show
how
long
the
car
was
there
in
the
station?
justice
potter
stewart
or
there
--
justice
potter
stewart
was
this
a
what,
a
passenger
train?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
a
mail
car,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
any
evidence
the
car
had
ever
been
--
through
there
before?
