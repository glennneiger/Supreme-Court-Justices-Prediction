is
that
the
issue
--
justice

yes,
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
suggesting
is
he
had
a
better
case
against
the
p&le
than
against
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
sir,
i
don't.
that
would
go
towards
contributory
negligence
but
there's
no
finding
in
this
case
as
to
that.
and
of
course
there's
no
assumption
of
risk
in
this
case
and
so
on.
i
was
up
doing
those
as
well.
i'd
like
to
close
if
i
might
by
just
addressing
one
word
or
two
to
what
might
be
described
as
the
policy
aspect
of
this
case.
i
think
it
--
probably
my
position
in
that
regard
is
implicit
to
what's
already
been
said
it
is
that
in
order
to
justify
the
result
in
this
case,
this
court
has
got
to
extend
the
coverage
of
the
act
of
two
situations
not
heretofore
governed
by
any
case
including
the
harris
case
as
i
read
it.
certainly,
not
the
expressed
terms
of
the
harris
case,
don't
cover
this
fact
situation
and
i
think
it's
enough
to
say
that
if
it
is
so
extended,
this
court
has
perhaps
occupied
appeal
which
is
more
appropriate
occupied
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
