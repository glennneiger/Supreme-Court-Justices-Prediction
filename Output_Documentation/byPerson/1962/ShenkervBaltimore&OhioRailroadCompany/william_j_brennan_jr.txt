justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
a
counterpart
of
that
rule
in
other
circuits,
do
you
know
mr.
wright?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wright,
you
said
earlier
i
thought
at
the
outset
of
some
complaint
about
this
very
door
had
been
made
to
someone?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
--
why
--
what
was
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
meaning
the
p&le?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
apart
from
that
mr.
wright,
have
you
said
as
i
understand
you
to
say,
you
did
not
think
this
fellow
was
in
the
sinkler
line
of
authority?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
mind
saying
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
you're
--
what
you're
saying
here
is
p&le
is
in
the
position
of
the
employer
on
that
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
baltimore
is
in
the
position
of
the
belt
line?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
your
point
of
this
form
mr.
hadden
that
even
if
the
majority
meant
--
majority
has
even
purported
to
nevertheless
as
a
matter
of
internal
administration,
the
circuits
are
at
liberty
to
give
through
majority
the
meaning
they
gave
it
here
namely
absolute
majority
of
the
total
number
of
active
judges?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
he
did
work
at
the
station
itself,
i
gather
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
his
full-time
employment
was
at
the
station?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
that's
not
a
safety
appliance
act
claim,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
hadden,
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
suppose
that
b&o
has
been
in
the
railroad
business
long
enough
who
had
much
experience
with
stuck
doors.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
if
it
did,
i
would
suppose
if
it
--
he's
going
to
assign
one
of
its
employees
to
work
on
railroad
cars
of
p&le
which
might
get
stuck
doors,
it
might
have
some
duty
to
look
out
for
whether
--
inspect
in
advance
would
it
not?
just
as
it
does
i
take
it
on
its
own
it
has
--
doesn't
have
inspection
procedures
for
its
own
cars?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you've
made
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
hadden,
haven't
we
had
some
clinker
cases
where
we've
said
that
employees
stumbling
over
clinkers
could
recover
at
least
where
the
railroad
didn't
show
it
had
some
kind
of
inspection
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
inspection
procedures
whatever
that
--
was
there
any
question
of
the
right
of
the
employee
to
recover?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
was
no
evidence
at
least
of
any
inspection
procedures
to
discover
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
we
had
one
of
them
where
all
the
clinkers
are
suppose
to
come
from
a
locomotive
of
--
on
some
adjoining
track.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
gather
mr.
wright
urges
that
theory
of
recovery
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
say,
i
don't
think
mr.
wright
urges
that
theory
of
recovery
either
here.
as
i
understood
him,
he's
urging
that
this
is
a
situation
that
stuck
doors
or
stuck
doors
in
railroads
and
that
you're
going
to
put
your
employee
on
it,
you
ought
to
have
some
kind
procedure.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
have
we
had
any
issue
here
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
to
the
liability
of
p&le?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wright,
[inaudible]
p&le?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
event
the
reason
in
appeal
was
not
taken
was
that
you
thought
was
not
meritorious?
