mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
should
like
at
the
outset
to
address
a
word
or
two
to
the
rehearing,
the
alleged
rehearing
issue
in
this
case
and
then
i
shall
try
to
do
as
my
opponent
did
to
the
secondly
more
important
issue
that
of
the
merits
of
the
case.
to
summarize
the
petitioner's
position
on
the
rehearing
issue,
it
is
in
a
nutshell
list
that
notwithstanding
the
express
statutory
language
which
makes
the
ordering
of
rehearings
dependent
upon
the
affirmative
vote
of
a
majority
of
the
full
bench
of
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals,
notwithstanding
that
requirement
and
in
the
light
only
of
the
fact
that
four
out
of
the
--
a
total
of
eight
justices
or
judges
rather
of
the
third
circuit
voted
in
favor
of
the
rehearing
en
banc
in
this
case.
but
on
those
facts
not
only
was
it
not
within
the
discretion
of
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
deny
rehearing
but
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
deny
it
and
that
on
the
vote
--
on
the
favorable
vote
of
a
4
to
2
majority,
a
rehearing
should
have
been
ordered.
my
opponent
points
to
the
western
pacific
case
as
authority
for
a
non-literal
interpretation
of
the
language
of
section
46
(c)
and
he
says
that
under
46
--
under
the
western
pacific
case
for
example,
it
is
--
it
has
been
held
that
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
may
delegate
to
the
original
three-man
panel,
the
power
to
initiate
the
en
banc
procedure.
well,
under
the
rules
of
the
third
circuit
that
is
--
that
--
the
rule
of
the
third
circuit
which
is
applicable
here
which
he
now
points
so
is
rule
4
(c)
of
the
third
circuit
expresses
the
rule
of
the
third
circuit
in
accordance
with
the
--
almost
verbatim
language
of
the
statute.
it
imposes
upon
the
panel
or
rather
the
full
consist
of
the
third
circuit,
the
responsibility
to
initiate
en
banc
rehearings.
but
he
--
what
my
opponent
fails
to
relate
to
the
court,
however,
is
that
the
western
pacific
case
did
something
in
addition
to
authorizing
the
delegation
of
the
power
to
the
original
three-man
panel.
it
in
effect
reposed
upon
the
courts
of
appeals
a
very
large
discretion
to
fashion
their
own
rules
on
the
en
banc
hearing
procedures
in
accordance
with
whatever
reasonable
procedures
they
might
find
convenient
and
it
laid
down
the
requirement
only
that
once
such
procedures,
such
convenient
and
reasonable
procedures
have
been
adopted
that
they
be
expressed
in
a
rule
so
that
the
mentioned
bar
--
the
litigants
as
well
know
what
the
rule
is,
so
that
they
can
avail
themselves
of
the
procedure.
my
point
is
this
that
the
third
circuit
has
exercised
its
discretion
as
authorized
to
it
under
the
western
pacific
case
by
following
the
statute
literally.
this
court
has
in
a
recent
decision,
the
american
foreign
steamship
company
case,
a
1960
decision
praised
and
i
think
an
opinion
by
justice
stewart
praised
the
thorough
machinery,
administrative
machinery
worked
out
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
has
held
in
fact
that
this
is
one
of
the
circuits
where
the
procedure
is
best
worked
out
and
best
known
because
of
certain
articles
written
by
some
of
the
judges.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes,
sir?
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
that's
as
i
understand
it,
yes
sir.
they
say
that
it
must
be
an
absolute
majority
of
the
full
court
that
this
court
has
expressly
in
western
pacific's
case
said
that
is
an
authorized
procedure
in
the
absence
of
full
majority
of
the
entire
panel.
it's
our
position
that
no
rehearing
would
be
appropriate
in
this
situation.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
my
point
does
go
that
far,
your
honor.
and
i
would
say
further
that
in
connection
with
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute
and
the
en
banc
procedure
itself
that
does
serve
a
valuable
--
a
valuable
service
in
laying
it
rest
the
disputed
questions
as
between
perhaps
raised
panels
of
a
given
circuit.
it,
as
my
worthy
opponent
points
out
does
establish
for
the
circuit,
the
major
doctrinal
trends
of
the
future.
however,
that
purpose
will
not
be
served
by
ordering
a
rehearing
to
be
held
by
something
less
than
a
full
panel
of
bench.
one
can
conceive
of
a
situation
where
if
a
six-judge
panel
out
of
a
total
of
eight
judges
of
that
circuit
were
to
decide
a
case
with
two
--
two
judges
absent
for
reasons
which
is
like
the
present
case
are
unexplained
that
those
two
judges
might
later
return.
these
are
likely
to
be
cases
which
are
close
and
controversial
in
any
event
and
the
result
might
later
change
and
the
--
their
earlier
decision
be
set
aside.
i
would
further
say
in
connection
with
the
rehearing
aspect
to
this
matter
that
the
case
had
--
this
case
has
now
been
admitted
by
this
court
for
a
decision
on
both
questions
as
i
would
understand
it,
certiorari
not
having
been
limited
to
one
question
or
the
other.
i
presume
therefore,
that
the
court
will
reach
and
decide
the
questions
so
far
as
the
merits
of
the
case
are
concerned.
and
if
that
is
so,
of
course
the
question
of
rehearing
becomes
moot
because
any
major
doctrinal
trends
will
have
been
established
by
this
court
not
only
for
the
third
circuit
but
for
the
entire
country.
i
pass
now
to
the
question
of
the
merits
and
i'll
point
out
by
way
of
preliminary
in
that
connection
that
this
case
is
not
one
of
those
many
cases
rising
under
the
f.
e.
l.
a.
which
involves
nothing
more
than
weighing
of
the
evidence
such
as
for
example
the
case
--
sebastian
case
decided
this
monday.
this
case
is
one
where
in
effect
the
facts
are
almost
stipulated
because
there's
so
little
dispute
about
them.
however,
i
think
it
is
important
that
the
court
have
before
it
what
the
full
facts
are
and
i
would
like
to
supplement
my
brother's
presentation
in
that
regard
without,
however,
suggesting
that
anything
he
has
said
is
inaccurate.
this
accident
took
place
at
the
new
castle
station
of
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
company.
it
is
a
station
comprised
of
a
building,
with
a
waiting
room,
restaurants,
ticket
office
where
both
b&o
and
p&le
tickets
were
sold,
a
baggage
room,
all
of
these
in
one
building
lying
to
the
north
of
all
the
tracks.
then
as
we
read
to
the
right
or
to
the
south
rather
there
were
two
baltimore
and
ohio
tracks,
eastbound,
westbound
separated
by
a
platform.
there
was
a
fence
separating
the
premises
of
the
b&o
from
the
p&le.
the
fence
had
a
gate
in
it
and
there
was
a
crossing,
planked
in
crossing
by
means
of
which
the
wheel
--
four-wheel
push
truck
which
the
plaintiff
--
petitioner
was
operating
at
the
time
that
these
arose
could
be
pushed
from
the
b&o
premises
over
to
the
p&le.
the
duties
of
the
petitioner
generally
speaking,
it
was
without
dispute
--
without
substantial
dispute
that
he
was
in
the
general
employ
of
the
b&o.
he
was
paid
at
least
in
the
first
instance
by
the
b&o.
he
was
told
what
to
do
by
the
b&o
ticket
agent
who
was
in
--
who
was
placed
of
--
whose
office
was
in
the
b&o
station.
the
record
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
has
pointed
out
is
substantial
void
however,
with
regard
to
any
further
details
of
the
relationship
of
the
two
railroads
one
to
the
other.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
that's
correct.
except
through
--
to
limited
extent,
he
was
also
had
some
duties
as
a
caller
and
in
that
discharge
of
those
duties
he
would
go
around
the
town
of
new
castle
and
call
b&o
employees
for
duties.
i
think
the
record,
however,
admits
what
is
substantially
and
un-contradictable
inference
and
that
is
that
so
far
as
petitioner's
duties
involved
the
p&le
railroad,
servicing
its
trains,
it
can
hardly
be
contradicted
that
the
petitioner
necessarily
had
to
depend
ultimately
at
least
for
his
instructions
on
the
p&le
because
the
p&le
was
the
only
one
who
had
power
to
schedule
its
trains.
it
was
the
one
who
therefore
of
necessity
told
by
whatever
circuitous
means
directed
the
petitioner
to
load
and
unload
that
the
trains
that
came
in
on
the
p&le
tracks.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
well,
that
can
be
hypothesis,
your
honor
but
i
assume
that
there
probably
would
be
telephone
calls
from
the
p&le
to
the
b&o
station
agent
who
would
then
relay
them
to
petitioner
and
say,
“please
go
and
load
train
x.”
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
to
the
extent
that
it
may
not
have
been
scheduled
routinely.
the
--
i
think
it's
apparent
from
what
my
adversary
has
said
that
the
sole
and
only
cause
of
negligence
in
this
case
relates
to
the
claim
of
the
defective
door
of
the
p&le
baggage
car.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
no,
sir
it
is
not
a
claim
that
it
is.
the
--
from
the
facts
that
are
in
evidence
this
is
the
un-contradicted
record.
the
train,
the
p&le
train
arrived,
it
was
in
the
station.
the
train
arrived
in
the
station.
petitioner
was
already
there
with
his
truck
loaded
with
mail
bags.
he
then
proceeded
to
load
his
mail
bags
through
the
door
which
could
not
be
opened
fully
and
it
was
only
perhaps
a
matter
of
two
minutes,
at
the
most
three
minutes
before
the
time
both
--
before
the
time
that
he
was
injured.
thereafter,
he
offloaded
some
further
mail
bags
which
were
taken
back
to
the
united
states
mail
truck
from
which
he
had
taken
those
which
he
was
engaged
in
handling
when
he
was
hurt.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
there
is
only
sentence
in
the
record
that
touches
upon
that
but
in
the
interest
--
plaintiffs
own
testimony
and
i
believe
the
only
interest
from
it
is
that
they
came
from
the
united
states
post
office,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
no,
sir
from
the
new
castle
post
office
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes,
sir.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes,
sir,
i
--
i've
forgotten
that
important
part
and
i'll
try
to
find
it.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
alright.
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
it
is
in
the
record,
yes,
right
at
the
beginning
of
petitioner's
testimony.
this
is
the
only
type
of
negligence,
is
the
defective
door.
there
is
no
evidence
and
the
petitioner
does
not
now
in
his
briefs
or
in
his
argument
to
--
until
the
present
time
in
this
court
point
to
any
reasonable
practical
means
by
which
the
b&o
could
have
known
or
--
about
the
defect
or
had
done
anything
about
it.
there
is
--
the
record
is
entirely
silent
on
the
matter.
there
--
he
says
that
there
is
some
duty
of
inspection
which
devolves
upon
a
railroad
in
sending
its
employees
to
premises
to
off-railroad
premises,
if
you
will.
but
he
does
not
explain
in
concrete
terms
and
the
terms
of
the
facts
of
this
case
how
that
duty
which
he
says
exist
could
have
been
resolved,
could
have
been
discharged
by
the
respondents.
he
submits
to
the
court
that
the
record
does
not
admit
of
any
reasonable
construction
in
this
regard
and
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
b&o
railroad
could
have
done
anything
to
prevent
this
accident.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
no
sir.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
no
sir.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
no,
sir.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
your
honor,
this
comes
down
to
an
interpretation
of
this
court's
many
decisions
in
the
field
as
to
what
is
meant
by
the
non-delegable
duty
of
care
which
is
imposed
upon
a
railroad
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
to
see
that
its
employees
have
a
reason
to
which
they
are
placed
to
work.
there
are
many
cases.
there
are
two
cases
that
come
to
mind
instantly
in
this
court
having
to
do
with
what
the
responsibility
the
b&o
had
toward
its
employee
when
it
sent
him
off
its
own
premises
those
being
the
ellis
case,
a
side
track
case,
it's
one
of
hundreds
of
railroad
side
track
cases
where
the
courts
--
this
court
and
other
courts
have
gone
very,
very
far
to
impose
a
duty
to
foresee
accidents
on
side
tracks
of
other
--
of
third
party
industries.
we
say
in
this
case
that
our
duty
to
follow
the
petitioner.
we
were
responsible
to
him
to
emphasize
care
but
care
implies
that
we
have
notice
of
a
defect
or
of
a
condition
or
a
risk
which
will
make
his
activities
on
the
premises
of
the
third
party,
here
the
p&le,
hazardous.
this
defect
--
in
the
first
instance
there
is
no
testimony
as
to
how
long
it
had
been
in
effect
as
merely
one
sentence
in
the
record
that
it
had
been
reported
to
the
p&le.
secondly,
assuming
that
it
had
been
an
existence
for
some
substantial
period
of
time,
its
existence
have
been
at
some
other
place
where
it
would
have
been
absolutely
impossible
for
a
any
representative
or
inspector
for
the
b&o
to
have
discovered
it.
we
say
therefore
that
although
the
duty
does
exist,
and
although
it
is
an
onerous
duty,
and
although
there
are
cases
after
cases
off
premises
where
a
railroad
is
held
to
have
breached
the
duty
and
therefore
for
jury
issues
to
have
arisen,
that
this
is
not
such
a
case,
that
there
are
no
facts
in
this
record.
it
will
require
clairvoyance
for
--
complete
clairvoyance
for
the
defendant
to
have
foreseen
the
happening
of
this
accident.
because
it
was
unnoticed
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
jury
issues
would
surely
have
been
presented,
yes,
sir.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
well,
i
would
say,
your
honor
as
to
that
question,
the
duty
to
inspect
under
our
negligence
statute
is
a
duty
which
must
be
governed
by
the
circumstances
confronting
the
parties.
now,
is
--
if
it's
a
duty
to
inspect
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
there
also
must
necessarily
be
a
duty
to
inspect
where
for
example
an
employee,
as
a
railroad
messenger
is
sent
out
to
the
city
streets
to
deliver
mail
or
what
have
you,
or
shenker
for
example
in
this
case,
if
he'd
been
run
over
by
--
when
he
was
out
calling
people
what
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
we're
not
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
well,
suppose
it
had
been
--
suppose
there
had
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
a
stuck
door
on
the
mail
truck
for
example
which
is
a
case
that
i
have
hypothesized
on
the
briefs.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes
sir.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
i
would
assume
they
would
know
where
the
stuck
door
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
as
to
stuck
doors,
i
am
at
loss
to
answer
the
question.
i
don't
know
whether
it
does
not
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
--
but
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events,
a
stuck
door
is
going
to
become
apparent
to
employees
of
the
b&o
if
it's
a
b&o
car.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
i
would
make
the
argument
--
in
the
first
--
if
this
were
b&o
car
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
i
was
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
i
would
make
that
--
the
same
argument
with
probably
somewhat
less
assurance,
your
honor,
but
i
would
make
the
same
argument
if
it
is
a
car
in
the
possession
in
the
ownership
of
the
b&o.
there
are
some
court
cases
that
say
the
very
existence
of
a
defect
is
sufficient
evidence
to
take
to
the
jury.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
i
don't
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
greater
duty
of
care
but
the
duty
is
one
that's
continuous.
it's
the
duty
of
ordinary
care
towards
its
employees.
now,
there
are
categories
of
cases
where
there
isn't
affirmative
duty
such
as
the
safety
appliance
act
cases
where
whether
you're
negligent
or
not,
it
makes
no
difference.
if
there's
a
defect,
you're
liable
to
your
employee.
the
cases
are
really
no
different
on
--
where
premises
of
the
employing
railroad
are
involved
and
of
premises.
the
duty
is
the
same
and
i
think
it's
--
the
cases
are
uniform
or
to
the
general
effect
that
even
on
your
own
premises,
even
on
the
b&o
premises,
even
if
this
had
been
a
b&o
car,
there
would
have
to
be
something
in
the
--
in
evidence
to
show
that
the
notice
came
to
us
of
the
defect.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
well,
that
carries
me
to
another
aspect
of
my
arguments,
your
honor.
certainly,
the
p&le
inspector
or
baggage
man
could
recover
from
the
p&le.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
and
i'll
--
an
argument
which
we
make
in
our
brief
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
there
was
evidence
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
no,
there
was
evidence
that
the
door
had
stuck
and
it's
been
reported
and
not
repaired.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
there's
one
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
there
are
clinker
cases
which
hold
i
recall
that
through
issues
are
presented
from
the
bare
evidence
that
the
clinker
was
precedent
in
a
place
where
employees
were
required
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
well,
necessarily
since
it's
our
own
premises,
we're
talking
about
in
your
hypothetical
case,
it's
we
who
created
the
defect
and
i
think
that
furnishes
the
gravamen
of
the
offense
of
negligence.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
i'm
not
as
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
--
familiar
with
that
case,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
our
position
is,
your
honor,
as
to
the
instructions
that
they
do
not
state
the
correct
test
of
legal
liability
and
that
if
that
test
had
been
applied,
the
case
would
not
have
gone
to
the
jury.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
well,
the
instruction
said
and
i
do
have
them
here
and
can
provide
the
court
with
a
copy
if
you'd
like
to
have
them.
they
say
in
general
that
there
is
responsibility
upon
a
railroad
to
furnish
its
employees
with
reasonably
safe
appliances,
cars,
and
whatnot
and
that
it
makes
no
difference
whose
appliances
whether
the
railroad
owns
them
or
on
whose
premises
they
are
located.
now,
that
we
regard
as
a
test
which
mistakes
the
law.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
mr.
justice.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
that
that
--
that
i
gather
is
his
basic
position
and
our
position
--
our
answer
to
that
is,
if
he
will
stand
up
and
tell
us
how
as
reasonable
operatives
of
railroads,
we
are
going
to
discharge
that
obligations.
we
will
be
glad
to
assume
the
responsibility,
we
think
it's
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
no
sir.
except
the
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
that's
correct
your
honor.
subsidiary
to
our
main
argument
and
i
would
like
to
pass
that
briefly
now
is
an
alternative
contention.
in
the
trial
court,
the
petitioner
brought
suit
against
not
only
the
b&o
railroad,
but
the
p&le
railroad.
at
the
close
of
all
the
evidence
that
p&le
was
directed
out
by
the
trial
judge,
first
on
the
grounds
that
there
have
been
no
employment
relationship
shown
to
a
sufficient
--
to
support
an
f.
e.
l.
a.
case
against
the
p&le,
and
secondly
that
there
was
no
diversity
of
citizenship.
we
would
--
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
briefs
and
i
should
like
to
invite
the
attention
of
the
court
now
to
the
fact
that
our
load
of
facts
and
evidence
are
quite
skeletal
as
to
the
relationship
between
the
two
railroads
at
the
time
of
the
question.
there
is
an
adequate
basis
we
think
for
a
jury
issue
of
liability
as
to
the
p&le
under
the
f.
e.
l.
a.
there
are
two
bodies
of
decisions,
one
of
which
is
the
sinkler
line
decisions
which
i
think
the
court
has
well
in
mind
that
i
want
to
deliver
which
holds
that
an
operational
type
of
activity
makes
in
effect
--
converts
an
employee
of
one
railroad
into
an
employee
of
another
and
therefore
perhaps
entitles
him
to
recover
under
the
f.
e.
l.
a.
secondly,
there's
another
line
of
decisions
which
maybe
referred
to
as
the
loan
servant
doctrine,
traditionally
it
is.
there's
no
question
in
this
case
but
that
the
work
being
done
by
the
petitioner
at
the
time
of
his
injury
was
work
for
the
p&le.
it
was
work
which
was
totally
unrelated
to
the
b&o.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
b&o
was
in
any
way
interested
between
--
in
the
transfer
of
mail
between
the
post
office
and
the
p&le.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
no,
sir,
we
don't.
however,
petitioner
makes
the
argument
that
--
a
rather
emotional
argument
that
what
is
going
to
happen
to
the
railroad
employees
if
f.
e.
l.
a.
and
liability
is
not
imposed
upon
employing
railroads
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
our
response
to
that
is
that
his
f.
e.
l.
a.
rights
are
protected
that
if
he
had
appealed
from
the
dismissal
of
the
pittsburgh
&
lake
erie
railroad
by
the
trial
court,
i
think
this
court
would
find
itself
without
too
much
question
holding
that
there
was
f.
e.
l.
a.
liability
issue.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
he
had
a
pretty
near
perfect
case,
i
would
say,
yes,
sir.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes
sir.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
that's
right
[inaudible]
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes,
sir.
i
think
perhaps
it's
appropriate
to
summarize
our
position
at
this
time
and
close
my
argument.
it
boils
down
simply
to
this
that
under
the
authorities
of
this
court
as
well
as
the
lower
federal
courts,
there
has
to
be
one
of
three
fact
situations
developed
by
the
evidence
and
that
none
of
them
is
--
there
is
no
case
of
liability.
first,
it
has
to
be
shown
perhaps
that
the
employing
railroad
created
the
defect.
we've
not
--
that
is
not
our
case.
secondly,
the
cases
which
mr.
--
my
adversary
points
out,
mr.
wright
that
he
thinks
i
have
misread
them
and
misargued
them.
i
--
for
myself
on
good
offices,
to
the
court
in
that
connection
i
think
i
have
analyzed
these
cases
as
fairly
and
as
objectively
as
i'm
capable
of
and
i
don't
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
the
harris
case,
your
honor,
can
be
read
i
think
in
more
than
one
way
but
i
do
think
that
there
is
evidence
in
the
harris
case
from
which
there
was
evidence
commented
upon
by
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion.
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
ohio
recites
that
the
fact
situation,
the
unevenness
of
the
block
and
the
group
--
and
the
work
that
was
being
done
and
the
court
--
the
tie
according
to
plaintiff's
testimony
i
quote
briefly
from
page
544
of
ohio
appeals,
the
tie
according
to
the
plaintiff's
testimony
was
covered
with
mud,
grease
or
oil
according
to
the
plaintiff's
testimony.
plaintiff's
foreman
walked
by
and
the
upon
plaintiff's
asking
for
help
to
extract
the
block,
plaintiff
was
told,
“you
are
a
big,
strong
man.
we
are
busy.
hurry
up.”
now,
without
going
any
further
to
the
details
of
the
harris
case,
it's
our
position
that
that
evidence
by
itself
shows
notice
of
what
was
there
to
be
seen
through
the
foreman
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
which
was
the
employing
railroad
and
the
defendant
in
that
case.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
no,
sir.
i
would
say
--
it
simply
was
not
rejected.
what
this
court
did,
it
--
there
was
a
special
finding
which
is
referred
to
in
the
book
that
you
have
in
your
hand
which
was
to
the
general
effect
that
the
negligence
of
the
defendant
railway
was
in
requiring
plaintiff
to
work
on
a
slippery
place
where
there
was
some
unevenness
of
the
tie
and
the
road
to
that
effect,
yes.
and
the
only
thing
this
court
did
upon
certiorari
was
to
say
that
that
conclusion
as
found
by
the
ohio
jury
was
supported
by
the
evidence.
it
didn't
reject
the
ohio
court
--
the
ohio
supreme
court's
holding
which
you've
just
read
that's
expressly
declined
to
impose
a
duty
upon
the
railroad
to
go
over
the
premises
of
third
parties
with
the
client
[inaudible]
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes
sir.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes
sir.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes,
and
i
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
and
i'm
saying
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
that's
right.
i'm
trying
to
make
it
clear,
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
makes
it
clear
--
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
the
plaintiff's
foreman,
an
employee
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
did
have
knowledge
or
at
least
an
opportunity
to
know
about
the
conditions
which
the
jury
and
its
special
finding
had
described
as
negligence.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
oh
yes,
yes,
indeed
on
the
question
indeed
without
any
question,
in
our
case,
yes.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
that's
true.
mr.
alexander
h.
hadden
yes,
sir.
except
--
you
suggest
that
has
some
particular
legal
significance?
