mr.
arthur
littleton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like,
if
i
may,
to
address
myself
at
the
outset
to
the
sherman
act,
because
in
this
case
the
department
of
justice
has
asked
that
an
injunction
issue
against
this
merger
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
now
the
sherman
act
condemns
unreasonable
restraints.
the
un-contradicted
testimony
of
numerous
bankers,
businessmen,
economists
is
that
not
only
there
had
been
no
unreasonable
restraint,
there
will
be
no
unreasonable
restraint
from
this
merger,
there
will
be
no
restraint
of
any
kind
whatsoever.
this
court
has
said
that
for
an
injunction
to
issue
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
there
must
be
a
definite
showing
of
illegality.
the
department
of
justice
on
whom
the
burden
falls
to
show
that
has
failed
utterly
to
show
any
definite
facts
demonstrating
the
illegality
of
this
merger.
instead
of
that,
they
have
abandoned
such
oral
testimony
as
was
presented
and
they
presented
100s
of
pages
on
it
and
rely
entirely
on
statistics.
now,
i'd
like
to
discuss
those
statistics
in
a
few
moments,
but
right
at
this
point,
i
should
like
to
amplify
what
mr.
price
has
said
about
the
reasons
for
the
merger.
this
was
not
to
monopolize,
nor
to
insulate
these
banks
from
competition.
it
was
for
a
perfectly
good
business
reason,
mainly
the
whole
philadelphia
business,
which
has
been
going
to
new
york
and
to
other
cities.
the
activities
of
the
outside
banks
that
is
the
bank's
foreign
to
pennsylvania
or
foreign
to
the
philadelphia
area
which
come
into
philadelphia,
our
legion,
judge
loevinger
would
have
you
to
believe
and
his
brief
would
have
you
believe
that
this
is
de
minimis.
the
footnote
on
page
10
on
our
brief
indicates
that
in
many,
many,
many
places
in
this
record
where
it
is
stated
that
philadelphia
fairly
swarms
with
emissaries
from
outside
banks.
new
york
--
not
only
new
york,
first
boston.
first
boston
national
bank
is
one
of
our
biggest
competitors.
they
have
people
in
there
all
the
time.
mellon
bank
out
in
pittsburgh,
which
is
infinitely
larger,
very
much
larger
than
our
bank,
constantly
in
philadelphia
soliciting,
even
dallas,
cleveland,
st.
louis,
because
there
are
many
cities
in
the
united
states
much
smaller
than
philadelphia
that
have
a
larger
bank
and
these
banks
come
into
these
fast
growing
philadelphia
industries
and
get
the
business
which
should
be
going
to
philadelphia
banks
and
which
would
be
going
to
the
philadelphia
banks
under
the
testimony
of
the
businessmen,
another
bankers
who
were
called,
provided
there
was
the
bank
with
a
lending
limit
sufficient
to
take
care
of
their
needs
and
with
resources
which
would
enable
them
to
make
the
kind
of
loans
that
these
enlarging
and
growing
businesses
require.
it
was
demonstrated
and
there
are
exhibits
to
show
that
business
and
industry
have
grown
in
the
philadelphia
area
in
the
last
10
years
at
just
twice
the
rate
that
the
bank's
resources
and
the
bank's
lending
limits
have
grown.
this
is
because
of
the
great
upsurge
of
business
in
the
delaware
valley.
this
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
and
purposes
of
this
proposed
merger.
mr.
arthur
littleton
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
that
doesn't
follow
at
all.
it
--
mr.
arthur
littleton
i
suppose
they
are,
but
there
is
ample
competition
from
outside
as
well
as
from
inside
the
philadelphia
area
or
the
four-county
area
that
judge
loevinger
contends
for.
at
all
times,
there's
infinite
competition.
as
mr.
price
has
said,
there
are
17
banks
in
new
york
with
a
lending
limit
of
a
$1
million
or
more.
mr.
arthur
littleton
certainly
it
would.
mr.
arthur
littleton
i
guess
he
would.
excuse
me
sir,
i
can't
see
any
reason
why
he
shouldn't
be
able
to.
mr.
arthur
littleton
no,
he
hasn't.
excuse
me?
if
you'd
turn
to
page
--
if
you'd
turn
to
page
13
of
our
brief,
you'll
see
that
a
customer
that
wants
up
to
a
$1
million
would
have
7
alternative
choices
in
the
four-county
area.
mr.
arthur
littleton
well,
how
many
of
you
need
to
have
competition,
if
your
honor
please.
this
doesn't
effect
competition
in
that
area
and
it
enables
us
to
compete
with
the
giants
from
the
industry
existing
not
only
in
new
york,
but
in
other
parts
of
the
united
states
that
are
coming
in
and
getting
this
philadelphia
business.
now
the
congress
in
adopting
the
bank
merger
act
of
1960
and
incidentally,
that
is
printed
in
full
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
showed
and
the
congressional
record,
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
legislative
history
which
is
also
in
our
appendix
for
a
large
part,
also
showed
the
considerations
that
were
given
and
all
the
way
through
those
debates
and
the
reports
of
the
senate
committee
and
the
reports
of
the
house
committee,
it
is
shown
and
demonstrated
that
congress
felt
that
banking
should
not
be
subjected
to
the
same
kind
or
restrictions
or
to
be
subjected
to
the
same
test
as
those
under
the
clayton
act,
but
they
wanted
to
have
some
definitive
statute
and
they
passed
the
act
of
1960,
which
put
in
the
hands
in
this
case,
because
it's
a
national
bank,
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
the
duty
of
ascertaining
the
facts
relative
to
any
merger
where
the
resultant
bank
was
to
be
a
national
bank.
they
said
that
he
should
consider
six
banking
factors
or
elements
and
also
the
possibility
of
the
effect
of
the
merger
on
competition
or
tendency
toward
a
monopoly.
mr.
arthur
littleton
yes.
mr.
arthur
littleton
if
your
honor
please,
it
didn't
repeal
the
clayton
act,
[voice
overlap]
because
the
clayton
act
by
its
terms
does
not
apply
to
banks.
mr.
arthur
littleton
section
7?
mr.
arthur
littleton
of
the
clayton
act?
it
is
not
apply
to
banks
by
its
terms.
my
argument
does
not
say
it
repealed
the
sherman
act
under
which
this
action
is
brought
for
an
injunction.
the
act
of
1960,
we
argued
--
mr.
arthur
littleton
we
are
not
arguing
that
here.
we
argue
that
below
if
your
honor
please
and
there
is
a
great
deal
of
weight
that
can
be
given
to
it
if
you
go
through
the
legislative
history
of
this
case,
but
judge
clary
decided
that
against
this
below,
because
he
said
while
he
was
greatly
impressed
that
this
is
something
that
is
intended
by
congress
to
be
left
entirely
to
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
in
this
case
by
the
federal
reserve
that
for
it
to
be
a
state
bank,
nevertheless
he
felt
that
the
sherman
act
still
applied.
now
i
would
say
to
you
that
we
consider
whether
we
should
raise
it
up
here,
the
el
paso
case
came
down
in
the
mean
time
and
that
didn't
give
us
very
much
encouragement.
we
filed
our
brief
and
pan
america
came
down
and
while
at
first
that
made
us
wonder
upon
analysis,
i
don't
believe
it
could
have
been
very
much
help
in
this
situation,
but
we
came
to
the
conclusion
if
your
honors
please,
that
we
have
here
so
strong
a
case,
because
there
is
not
one
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
case
and
is
so
found
by
the
district
court
that
showed
that
will
be
the
slightest
restraint
or
the
slightest
tendency
toward
a
monopoly,
and
he
is
found
that
straight
through
and
there
is
no
countervailing
testimony.
mr.
arthur
littleton
the
federal
reserve
bank
filed
a
report
on
the
competitive
aspects
only,
under
this
act
of
1960.
if
it
is
one
that
needs
to
be
determined
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
he
has
the
authority,
the
jurisdiction,
the
responsibility
to
determine
whether
the
merger
should
be
approved.
he
asked
for
an
advisory
on
the
effect
and
competition
from
fdic
from
federal
reserve
board
and
the
attorney
general.
he
is
not
bound
by
that.
that
is
purely
an
advisor
and
--
mr.
arthur
littleton
copy
of
the
federal
reserve?
mr.
arthur
littleton
copy
of
the
fdi
stage,
copy
of
federal
reserve.
mr.
arthur
littleton
i'll
give
it
to
you
right
away.
mr.
arthur
littleton
but
while
i
am
getting
to
page
--
may
i
just
read
you
from
the
senate
committee
on
banking
and
currency
and
the
legislative
record,
the
committee
wants
to
make
crystal
clear
its
intention
that
the
various
banking
factors
in
any
particular
case
maybe
held
out
way
the
competitive
factors
and
that
the
competitive
factors,
however,
favorable
or
unfavorable
are
not
in
and
of
themselves
controlling
on
the
decision.
and
of
course,
the
banking
agencies
are
not
bound
in
their
considerations
of
the
competitive
factors
by
the
report
of
the
attorney
general.
they
will
have
much
information
in
their
own
files
and
they
may
obtain
information
or
advice
on
the
competitive
factors
from
other
sources.
the
committee
amendment
is
only
intended
to
make
sure
that
the
banking
agencies
get
a
report
on
the
competitive
factors
from
the
attorney
general
in
each
case,
but
it's
up
to
the
particular
administrative
officer
and
the
very
thing
that
you've
mentioned
if
your
honor
please,
the
size
of
this
record
shows
the
wisdom
of
leaving
it
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
administrative
officer,
to
which
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
in
this
case,
because
he
took
months
to
go
into
all
this
and
he
came
to
his
conclusion
after
he
reviewed
all
the
six
banking
factors,
including
the
convenience
and
the
needs
of
the
public,
which
makes
it
a
public
interest
test,
a
reasonable
test
as
your
honors
had
said
under
--
in
the
section
1
of
sherman
act
cases.
and
if
i
had
my
choice,
i
would
say
that
it
ought
to
be
left
with
the
administrative
officer,
but
i
don't
think
that
we
should
argue
that
here,
because
if
it's
decided
against
below
and
i
say
i
don't
think
the
decisions
of
this
court
would
sustain
us,
but
nevertheless
it
indicates.
i
would
say
to
you
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
arthur
littleton
that
the
federal
reserve
report
is
government
exhibit
161
in
the
record
2822.
mr.
arthur
littleton
that's
the
page.
mr.
arthur
littleton
28
22.
mr.
arthur
littleton
federal
reserve
report
came
to
a
conclusion
that
it
would
have
an
effect
on
competition
and
--
mr.
arthur
littleton
adverse,
adverse
effect
in
competition.
mr.
arthur
littleton
well,
i
think
just
size
and
concentration,
the
things
that
judge
loevinger
had
been
arguing
here
your
honors,
but
you
see,
it's
an
irrelevant
--
mr.
arthur
littleton
that's
what
they
said.
yes,
that's
what
they
said,
but
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
the
federal
reserve
advisory
report
on
competitive
aspects
of
this
is
irrelevant
in
this
situation.
here
we
had
a
two
months'
trial.
the
department
of
justice
could
have
called
people
from
the
federal
reserve
to
come
in
and
give
their
reasons
and
be
subjected
to
cross-examination.
the
district
court
said,
he
is
not
going
to
substitute
the
ex
parte
report
of
anybody
who
doesn't
come
in
and
like
all
the
witnesses
that
we
had,
the
banker
witnesses
and
the
customer
witness
and
the
economists,
who
subjected
themselves
to
searching
cross-examination
on
this,
he
is
not
going
to
substitute
or
the
decision
of
the
man
in
whose
hands
congress
placed
the
responsibility
for
this
job
on
such
an
ex
parte
untested
report,
which
was
written
months
in
advance
of
this
trial
and
was
written
without
the
advantage
of
hearing
all
the
facts
and
figures
which
were
developed
at
the
trial.
and
for
that
reason
--
mr.
arthur
littleton
they
were
not.
what
they're
doing
now
--
i
think
each
one
of
the
banking
bodies,
the
comptroller,
the
federal
reserve,
i
think
with
this
merger
now
they
do
have
a
hearing
that
which
anybody
can
appear.
mr.
arthur
littleton
but
they
did
not
at
this
time,
any
place.
mr.
arthur
littleton
yes.
mr.
arthur
littleton
yes.
mr.
arthur
littleton
that's
for
the
new
merged
bank,
there
is
none
now.
mr.
arthur
littleton
no
sir.
excuse
me,
there
are
two.
mr.
arthur
littleton
yeah,
well,
all
right,
false,
but
then
--
mr.
arthur
littleton
right
sir.
mr.
arthur
littleton
you
see
--
mr.
arthur
littleton
that's
right
mr.
justice
goldberg,
a
resident
in
philadelphia,
but
you
have
philadelphia
swarming
and
teaming,
where
there
was
one
witness
who
said
that
the
new
york
bankers
said,
philadelphia
is
a
happy
hunting
ground
of
new
york
banks.
mr.
arthur
littleton
all
right.
well
it
maybe
so,
probably
not
except
that
in
philadelphia
we
don't
have
a
big
enough
bank
to
properly
compete
with
these
giants?
in
pittsburgh
they
do,
in
boston
they
do.
mr.
arthur
littleton
but
of
course,
the
competition
that
existed
between
the
two
disappeared,
but
it
has
to
be
significant
competition.
it
has
to
be
significant.
competition,
this
court
has
said,
it
has
to
mean
something,
it
has
to
be
of
some
value,
this
has
no
value.
mr.
arthur
littleton
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
to
state
it
another
way,
we
take
the
figures
that
judge
loevinger
insisted
on
yesterday,
because
he
said
he
wanted
to
talk
about
people
instead
of
dollars
and
he
said
that
96%
in
numbers
of
customers
under
$10,000
were
in
the
four
counties.
all
right,
we
will
take
that
and
rotate
--
we
will
accept
this
four-county
area
for
purposes
of
argument.
96%
of
these
bank's
customers
will
have
41
alternative
choices
to
go
for
their
banking,
how
many
more
do
you
need
to
have
competition.
at
the
same
time,
at
the
other
end
of
this
scale,
we
will
be
able
to
compete
in
the
big
national
market,
not
only
for
big
national
business,
but
to
hold
our
own
business.
the
court
found
and
made
a
definite
find
that
this
merger
would
bring
many,
many
beneficial
effects
to
the
philadelphia
area
and
my
time
doesn't
permit
me
to
go
over
all
of
them,
but
they
are
in
our
brief,
because
i
want
to
move
to
the
final
point
of
my
argument,
which
i
believe
is
the
touchtone
in
this
whole
case.
certainly,
judge
loevinger
here
has
predicated
his
entire
argument
on
it.
mr.
arthur
littleton
they
expressed
the
opinion
that
this
would
benefit
competition
and
would
be
helpful
to
competition
in
the
regional,
national
and
international
field,
which
is
what
we
were
trying
to
get.
they
said
it
probably
would
have
some
effect
on
local
competition.
again,
nobody
from
fdic
was
called,
nobody
came.
this
was
a
report
written
long
before
this
trial.
they
didn't
have
the
benefit
of
what
was
coming
to
the
trial.
may
i
ask
your
honors
to
turn
to
page
18
of
our
brief,
because
this
is
really
the
crux
of
this
case?
now
mr.
price
has
demonstrated
to
you
all
i
think
that
banks
cannot
control
their
deposits.
judge
loevinger
made
some
statement
yesterday
that
this
big
bank
would
be
able
to
control
its
depositor
and
control
it
--
controlling
its
borrowing.
judge
loevinger
would
think
of
that
and
reflect
on
it
a
minute,
he'd
see
how
unsensible
that
is,
i
don't
know
where
he
has
his
bank
account,
but
let's
assume
he
has
it
in
the
biggest
bank
in
new
york.
he
can
change
his
depository
right
now
by
writing
out
a
check
for
his
balance
and
depositing
them
in
the
smallest
bank
in
washington
and
immediately
he
has
affected
a
change
and
no
matter
how
big
the
bank
is,
it
couldn't
control
him
at
all
in
doing
that.
if
he
had
a
loan
outstanding,
he
could
go
to
any
bank
in
philadelphia
or
washington
or
new
york
because
i
assume
judge
loevinger's
loan
would
be
a
good
loan
[laughter]
and
in
less
than
24
hours
those
banks
would
be
delighted
to
take
the
loan
over
from
the
biggest
bank
in
new
york
and
the
biggest
bank
in
new
york
couldn't
stop
it,
of
course
there
is
no
control.
but
let's
--
mr.
arthur
littleton
he
would
be
with
me
if
i
were
a
banker,
but
let's
accept
the
fact
that
even
though
we
can't
control
our
deposits
that
this
big
risk
of
concentration,
they
use
this
nasty
word
concentration,
what
it
means
is
their
share
of
the
banking
assets
in
a
given
area.
they
say
that
would
be
36%
and
in
this
if
your
honors
please,
i
say
is
the
touchtone
of
this
case.
if
you
look
at
page
18,
it
is
a
schedule
of
cities
of
over
100,000
populations
with
the
concentration
in
the
biggest
bank
in
each
as
of
june
30th,
1956.
if
we
get
down
to
philadelphia,
it
is
79
and
there
we
have
inserted
the
concentration,
which
the
department
of
justice
claimed
this
bank
will
have
after
the
merger
and
look
there
are
78
cities
of
100,000
or
more
in
the
united
states
of
america
which
have
a
higher
concentration
of
banking
assets
in
the
lead
bank
in
each
of
those
cities
than
this
bank
would
have
after
the
merger.
well,
now
was
there
ever
a
better
opportunity
for
the
department
of
justice
in
any
antitrust
case
to
show,
to
predict
what
the
effect
of
this
concentration
created
by
this
merger
would
have
on
competition,
what
restraints
it
would
produce?
there
they
have
78
test
tubes.
they
did
not
bring
in
a
single
witness
from
any
one
of
those
cites
to
say
what
the
effect
on
competition
in
banking,
this
so-called
concentration
in
the
lead
bank
in
each
of
those
cities
has.
i
don't
know
whether
they
even
looked
into
the
test
tubes,
but
if
they
looked
they
apparently
didn't
like
what
they
found
and
the
reason
they
didn't
is
because
all
the
testimony
in
this
case
is
to
the
contrary,
namely
that
there
is
ample
and
active
competition
in
banking
in
every
one
of
those
cities.
now
how
can
they
come
in
here
and
say,
sure
we
haven't
produced
anything
to
show
what's
going
on
in
san
francisco,
where
they
have
a
bank
with
58.7%
concentration.
they
don't
say
there
is
no
competition
in
banking
in
san
francisco.
this
great
concentration
in
the
lead
bank
in
san
francisco
is
a
restraint,
while
we
know
there
is
active
competition
in
banking
in
san
francisco,
but
they
haven't
tried.
look
at
saint
paul,
minnesota
55.6%
and
in
duluth,
minnesota
44.7%
and
in
minneapolis,
minnesota
38.3%,
all
much
higher
concentrations
than
this
merged
bank
will
have
and
i
assume
that
judge
loevinger
would
have
had
ample
opportunity
and
ability
to
produce
witnesses
from
those
three
minnesota
cities
to
show
if
witnesses
could
be
found
to
say
that,
“oh
yes,
this
concentration
in
the
lead
bank
has
completely
blocked
competition.”
mr.
arthur
littleton
well
he
could
--
mr.
arthur
littleton
well,
he
brought
little
bankers
from
little
towns
all
over
the
united
states,
including
one
from
some
little
town
of
4000
in
california
to
ask
him
about
that,
he
could
certainly
have
brought
somebody
from
there.
from
san
francisco,
why
he
goes
all
the
effort
to
bring
the
little
man
from
the
town
of
4000
in
california
instead
of
bringing
somebody
from
san
francisco.
mr.
arthur
littleton
well
it
might
be
sir,
it
might
be
sir,
but
that
isn't
our
case.
mr.
arthur
littleton
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
littleton
we
are
trying,
but
this
one
merger
case.
mr.
arthur
littleton
we're
trying
this
one
merger
case
--
mr.
arthur
littleton
right.
and
they
have
not
shown
where
philadelphia
is
any
different
from
any
of
these
other
cities.
mr.
arthur
littleton
why
36.2?
mr.
arthur
littleton
well,
then
if
it
is
up
to
the
department
of
justice
on
whose
shoulders
the
burden
the
proof
is
to
produce
such
people.
we
produced
one
man
from
camden
and
you'll
notice
camden
has
got
a
very
high
concentration.
mr.
arthur
littleton
we
produced
the
president
of
not
the
first
bank,
but
one
of
the
banks
lower
down
on
the
list
and
we
said
to
him,
how
about
this
concentration
in
your
city
in
the
camden
trust
company.
the
man
we
called
is
president
of
the
first
camden
national.
mr.
arthur
littleton
no,
he
didn't
at
all.
mr.
arthur
littleton
what
he
said
was
that
the
fact
that
camden,
the
camden
trust
company
has
this
higher
concentration
of
assets
than
we
have
doesn't
give
it
the
slightest
power.
mr.
arthur
littleton
well,
he
was
a
very
sophisticated
banker
if
you
please
and
he
said
that
he
was
giving
and
he
was
interested
in
the
success
of
his
own
bank
and
he
said,
they
can't
affect
us
in
anyway.
mr.
arthur
littleton
they
can't
affect.
mr.
arthur
littleton
he
was
there
--
mr.
arthur
littleton
he
was
there
to
testify,
and
he
did.
he
was
there
to
testify
as
to
whether
the
fact
that
the
camden
trust
company,
a
bank
much
bigger
than
his
had
55%
of
whatever
the
percentage
was
of
the
banking
asset
had
anti
competitive
effect
on
him
and
he
said,
“no,
we
compete
everyday.”
they
said,
they
can't
--
mr.
arthur
littleton
he
said
we
make
loans.
they
can't
control
us
in
the
loans,
they
can't
control
us
in
interest
rates,
they
can't
control
us
in
service
charges.
and
he
says,
it's
not
only
us
it's
the
other
smaller
banks,
they
are
all
competing.
there
is
no,
there
is
no
bad
effect
on
competition,
simply
because
the
lead
bank
so-called,
the
number
one
bank
has
this
so-called
concentration
of
assets.
mr.
arthur
littleton
you
mean
the
merger
and
merger
and
merger?
mr.
arthur
littleton
oh!
certainly
there'd
be
some
point,
but
that
would
have
to
be
determined
by
the
facts.
and
all
the
facts
that
have
been
brought
out
in
this
merger
by
bankers,
by
the
very
competitors
that
judge
loevinger
says
he
is
trying
to
protect
from
anti
competitive
effects
or
restraints
from
this
merger.
they
were
the
ones,
who
came
in
and
said,
but
this
merger
is
not
going
to
hurt
us,
there
is
no
way
in
which
it
can
do
anything
but
help
us,
it
will
bring
more
business
in.
there
will
be
a
greater
pool
of
credit
in
philadelphia.
we
will
share
in
this.
it
will
bring
business
in
the
industry
in
philadelphia.
we'll
lend
maybe
to
them,
we
maybe
the
second
bank,
we'll
lend
to
the
satellite
companies,
it
will
come
around
a
big
company.
we
will
lend
to
the
individual
officers
and
employees.
this
is
going
to
be
good
for
philadelphia.
mr.
arthur
littleton
well
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
if
there
are
41
banks
left
in
the
area,
which
the
department
of
justice
has
picked
out
which
we
accept
for
purposes
of
argument
that
is
not
being
reduced
very,
very
much.
mr.
arthur
littleton
yes
but
the
burden
--
mr.
arthur
littleton
here,
here
--
mr.
arthur
littleton
well,
it's
the
department
of
justice
who
has
to
produce
the
evidence.
our
evidence
was
that
there
is
ample
and
active
competition
in
every
one
of
these
cities,
which
has
a
higher
concentration
of
assets
in
the
lead
bank
than
the
philadelphian
national
and
girard
will
have
after
they
are
merged
and
that
is
shown
on
page
18.
mr.
arthur
littleton
yes,
new
york,
because
that's
where
the
giants
in
the
industry
are,
of
course.
mr.
arthur
littleton
well,
that
doesn't
have
any
effect
on
us.
i
mean
that
doesn't
relate
to
us.
mr.
arthur
littleton
the
ones
that
we
--
mr.
arthur
littleton
i
don't
think
the
two
things
are
related
if
your
honor
please.
the
reason
that
in
new
york,
the
biggest
bank
only
has
21%
is
because
there
are
a
lot
of
giants
of
almost
equal
stature
in
new
york,
all
of
which
come
over
and
compete
with
us.
now
you
take
the
other
cities
that
i
speak
of,
the
78
[inaudible]
mr.
arthur
littleton
that
is
right,
because
you
have
giants
in
chicago,
but
look
at
san
francisco,
look
at
los
angeles,
look
at
detroit,
look
at
boston
all
of
which
have
bigger
banks
than
we
have.
there
the
concentration
in
the
lead
bank
is
much
greater
than
ours.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
if
your
honors
please
is
if
there
is
no
adverse
effect
on
competition,
if
there
is
no
restraint
in
those
78
cities,
how
can
the
department
of
justice
come
in
here
and
say
because
philadelphia
will
have
a
lead
bank
with
36.2%
for
the
banking
assets
after
this
merger,
there
is
bound
to
be
a
restraint.
the
way
for
them
to
prove
it
was
to
bring
people
into
show
that
there
was
such
a
restraint
in
these
other
places.
what's
peculiar
about
philadelphia?
they
haven't
shown
any
peculiarity
about
philadelphia.
why
should
we
be
kept
in
this
position?
mr.
arthur
littleton
we
had
used
the
proof
by
people
who
knew.
mr.
arthur
littleton
from
every
one
of
these
cities.
mr.
arthur
littleton
the
comptroller
--
the
first
deputy
comptroller
of
the
currency,
the
man
who
had
formerly
been
first
deputy
comptroller
of
the
currency
stated
that
he
had
made
a
study,
that
the
comptroller
of
the
currency's
office
had
made
a
study
three
years
before
of
all
cities
over
50,000
and
with
one
slight
exception,
every
city
with
a
greater
concentration
in
the
lead
bank
than
philadelphia
will
have
after
this
merger
is
enjoying
adequate
and
ample
banking
competition
and
the
public
is
being
served.
mr.
arthur
littleton
i
don't
know
whether
it
included
gary
or
not.
mr.
arthur
littleton
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
you
picked
onto
gary,
but
you
got
to
remember
it,
you
probably
want
--
mr.
arthur
littleton
that's
right.
the
proximity
of
gary
to
chicago,
you
see
gary
is
right
next
to
chicago.
and
this
naturally
has
that
effect
and
they're
in
competition,
you
see
they
are
in
the
competition
with
all
the
chicago
banks
for
the
business
just
as
we
are
with
new
york.
mr.
arthur
littleton
yes,
sir.
we
called
eight
or
nine
heads
of
other
banks
large
and
small
and
they
are
in
agreement
that
this
merger
would
be
a
good
thing
for
philadelphia;
it
would
not
affect
them
competitively.
there
would
be
no
restraint.
they'd
be
able
to
compete
just
as
well
as
they're
and
the
competition
in
banking
in
philadelphia
is
right
at
this
height,
right
at
this
height
sir.
mr.
arthur
littleton
no,
sir.
mr.
arthur
littleton
no
sir,
there
was
no
[inaudible]
mr.
arthur
littleton
judge
loevinger
said
yesterday
that
judge
clary
had
predicated
his
opinion
on
a
mistaken
view
of
the
market.
judge
clary
didn't.
he
didn't
agree
with
them
that
the
four-county
area
was
the
relevant
market,
neither
did
we,
but
judge
clary
accepted
it
for
purposes
of
argument
and
made
all
his
findings
and
wrote
his
opinion
as
if
the
four
county
area
is
irrelevant.
we
are
doing
exactly
the
same
thing
in
this
argument.
we
are
not
making
any
point
of
that
here.
although,
it
is
the
most
tortured
lot
of
statistics
that
they
put
in
there,
because
they
do
not
pay
any
attention
to
the
43%
of
our
loans
that
come
from
outside
and
incidentally,
if
your
honor
please,
right
over
in
camden,
rca,
one
of
our
good
customers,
would
be
a
better
customer
if
we
had
greater
resources
and
had
a
higher
lending
rate,
that
they
will
not
even
include
in
our
relevant
mark.
mr.
arthur
littleton
we
are
perfectly
satisfied
if
you
consider
the
four
counties
as
relevant,
because
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
it
seems
to
me
is
unanswerable.
it
hasn't
been
answered
by
government.
all
they
do
is
bring
in
these
statistics
that
after
this
merger
we
will
control
36.2%
of
the
banking
assets
in
the
philadelphia
area
and
i
say
that
that
table
on
page
18
completely
destroys
that
as
the
argument.
mr.
arthur
littleton
well
it
narrows
it
in
the
fact
that
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
start
with
a
relevant
market
of
the
four
counties,
if
you
are
willing
to
accept
it,
i
should
think
you
would
want
to
consider
it
a
little,
because
it
goes
so
against
the
reality
--
mr.
arthur
littleton
that's
right.
thank
you
your
honor.
