how
many
banks
are
there
eligible
to
make
loans
of
that
magnitude?
justice
potter
stewart
this
small
figure
you
gave
us,
this
percentage
of
a
single
--
fraction
of
a
single
percentage
point,
this
was
by
one
bank
to
one
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
these
two
banks?
justice
potter
stewart
well
neither
one
of
them
was
eligible
to
make
loans
of
the
magnitude
of
the
new
york
banks?
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
justice
department
oppose
it
from
the
beginning?
justice
potter
stewart
filed
an
objection
with
the
comptroller.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
mean
at
the
comptroller
level.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
percentage
in
terms
of
the
size
of
the
accounts,
the
relative
figures
in
dollars
not
customers?
justice
potter
stewart
and
wouldn't
that
be
of
some
relevance
to,
at
least
in
the
banks,
looking
at
the
argument
that
the
purpose
of
this
merger
was
to
attract
large
accounts
in
philadelphia?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
have
the
statistics.
justice
potter
stewart
can
you
tell
me
where
they
are
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
can
you
tell
me
where
they
are
in
the
record
if
you
please?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking
about
the
prior
mergers?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
were
some
--
justice
potter
stewart
some
nine
mergers,
about
one
of
the
banks
and
some
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
--
mr.
price,
i
understood
judge
loevinger's
point
about
the
three
banks,
it
was
this,
that
this
merger
would
result
in
one
bank
having
about
a
third
of
the
business
in
this
four-county
area
and
if
that
was
right
for
these
two
banks,
then
it
would
be
right
for
other
banks.
so
you
would
end
up
with
three
banks
in
the
four-county
area,
philadelphia,
assuming
that
the
banks
wanted
to
merge.
justice
potter
stewart
with
the
three
bank
point
as
i
understood
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
there
are
some
communities,
small
communities
in
the
nation
where
there
is
only
one
bank
