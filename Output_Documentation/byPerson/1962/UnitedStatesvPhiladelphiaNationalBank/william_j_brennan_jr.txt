william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
measure
of
lending
capacity
in
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
deposits
plus
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
asset.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
looking
at
page
22
to
your
reply
brief,
that
table?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
correctly
understand
that
the
loans
over
$1
million,
34
are
in
the
four-county
area,
that
is
the
two
banks
and
36
are
outside
the
four-county
area?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
that's
mean?
what
you
mean
with
non
residents?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
this
doesn't
then
necessarily
mean
that
34
are
from
businesses
within
the
four-counties
and
36
businesses
outside
the
four-counties,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
domicile
that
leads
me
up
here,
what
you
mean
domicile?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
means
something
like
this
silco
is
now
[inaudible]
as
i
gather
that
silco
plant
is
within
the
four-county
area,
that
an
application
of
silco,
i
don't
know
whether
they
borrow
money
in
these
amounts
or
not,
but
if
they
did
then
an
application
might
now
come
from
detroit
instead
of
from
philadelphia.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
then
be
non
resident
rather
than?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
see,
you
said
that
is
a
restriction,
that
was
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
follows
a
fortiori.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
price,
is
there
any
evidence
of
exactly
how
many
of
these
larger
loans
were
lost
in
new
york
or
dallas
or
other
banks?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
these
executives
who
testified?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
you
clear
up
for
me
a
question
i
asked
judge
loevinger
yesterday,
what's
the
significance
of
36
out
of
area
loans
over
$1
million?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
wonder
does
it
mean
that
the
philadelphia
banks
now
do
attract
the
borrowers
from
some
distance
from
the
four-county
area?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
not
only
for
using
local
four-county
businesses,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
might
be
business
in
the
detroit
area.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
outside
the
four-county
were
used
with
businesses
outside.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
the
borrowers
who
may
have
offices
outside
the
area,
but
clients
within
the
area.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
i
gather,
is
it
the
hope
that
if
the
merger
were
approved,
the
larger
loan
limits
would
attract
even
more
of
this
business
from
outside
the
area?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
from
that
kind
of
business
who
but
the
banks
would
profit
in
the
philadelphia
area?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
attract
more
deposits
from
those
borrowers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
might
hope
that
it
would
attract
larger
deposits
from
these
borrowers
of
larger
loans?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
of
some
significance
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
page.--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
you
just
say
in
a
sentence
and
the
fact
what
was
the
federal
reserve
report?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
an
adverse
effect.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
these
advisory
--
are
they
ever
conceded
by
their
â€“-
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
did
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
littleton
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
or
the
reaction
of
the
other
philadelphia
banks
in
this
view?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
littleton
well
if
that
is
--
we
can
accept
the
premise
that
the
market
in
the
four
county
area,
does
that
now
hold
at
least
for
the
sherman
act
problem
we
have
decide,
the
issue
be
reasonable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
why
should
we,
if
judge
clary
and
you
argue
it
here
on
the
premise
without
quarrelling
over
it,
why
shouldn't
we
approach
the
decision
and
if
we
did
then
would
we
have
to
decide
anything
except
the
issues
reasonably?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
loevinger
if
you
are
right.
if
your
argument
in
the
brief
is
right,
certainly
it's
a
different
problem,
isn't
it,
that
section
7
applies?
[inaudible]
very
different
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
we
agree
with
your
position
then
certainly
the
tendency
too
is
a
very
different
test.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
understandable
with
evidence
of
some
of
these
other
philadelphia
banks
that
this
would
be
a
good
thing
both
for
them
and
for
their
customers,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
specific
fact
finding
by
judge
clary
on
this
subject?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
agree
--
i
think
mr.
price
told
us,
it
couldn't
have
any
effect
on
rates.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
be
i
misunderstood
mr.
price?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
fact
among
the
philadelphia
banks
today,
they
all
charge
the
same
rates
or?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
in
effect,
we
are
going
to
have
to
struggle
harder
to
hang
on
to
what
we
have
got?
