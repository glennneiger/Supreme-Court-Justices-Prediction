[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
know
the
capital
and
the
surplus,
you
know
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
capital
and
surplus
of
this
bank,
i
don't
find
it
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
that
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
that
in
your
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
federal
reserve
take
the
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
have
a
witness
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question
relevant
to
that
argument
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
as
to
the
thrust
of
it?
are
you
--
is
your
argument
that
the
new
act
of
congress
repealed
the
clayton
act
insofar
that
it
applies
to
banks?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
the
sections
which
you
refer
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
did
not
say
that
it
didn't
repeal
the
sherman
act
to
that
extent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
28.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
agree
that
he
could
ask
the
witness
or
just
assuming
the
witness
would
tell
us
on
some
of
the
cities
and
say
has
this
concentration
in
this
bank
reduce
competition,
and
just
asking
that
as
a
conclusion
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
is
he
going
to
prove
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
it
always
a
question
in
an
antitrust
case?
i'm
asking
because
i
just
want
to
view
as
to
whether
--
to
what
extent
competition
has
been
reduced?
does
it
not
necessarily
follow
that
if
you
had
50
banks
in
a
place
and
you
suddenly
merged
all
of
them
but
six,
the
competition
would
be
reduced
whether
anybody
said
it
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
understand
it
is
not
--
it's
always
a
question
of
how
many?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
of
course,
that's
the
way
it
always
starts
and
if
you
have
--
how
low
do
you
get
before
it
becomes
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
is
unreasonable,
well
that's
the
problem.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
it
is
easy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
someone
that
knows
something
about
these
cities,
who
has
lived
in
them
or
does
live
in
them
would
know
pretty
well
from
having
lived
there
or
something,
well
that
gave
that
bank
[inaudible]
kind
of
runs
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
favored
it,
didn't
he?
he
favored
reducing
the
number
of
banks,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
did
he
said
about
competition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
was
a
lender,
not
a
borrower?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
say
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
say
that
a
banker
would
be
sophisticated
enough
to
know
that
we
can
reduce
the
number
of
lenders
that
he
had
to
compete
with,
but
he
would
have
a
more
--
it
would
be
easier
for
him
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
he
wanted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
say
anything
about
lenders,
about
borrowers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
agree
here
that
they
would
at
some
point
at
which
it
would
have
an
effect
on
competition,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
somewhat
wouldn't
it,
like
getting
one
of
the
automobile
manufacturers
and
process
where
they
--
being
reduced
from
year-to-year,
one
of
them
to
testify
that
he
wasn't
hurt
by
the
fact
that
the
competition
was
being
reduced
to
fewer
and
fewer
businesses.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
you
these
questions,
because
i
realize
the
difficulty
of
[inaudible].
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
you
prove
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
you
have
to
have
evidence
and
if
so,
what
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
â€“-
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
it
not
be
true,
i
realize
the
force
of
your
argument,
but
look
at
gary,
indiana,
88
and
four-tenths
of
a
percent,
do
you
need
much
proof
there
to
think
that
they
might
be
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
gary,
indiana?
justice
hugo
l.
black
88
and
four-tenths
of
a
percent.
what
do
they
say
about
gary?
what
is
the
population
of
gary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
that
include
gary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
think
if
these
figures
might
indicate
to
me
that
it
has
drawn
influence
that
maybe
the
comptrollers
has
not
been
controlling
them
much,
if
they
then
done
this
by
merger,
if
they've
done
this
by
merger
--
[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
one
on
the
list
you
showed
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
before
you
start?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
that
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
does
not
apply
to
bank?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
understand
the
statement
made,
but
you
said
that
[inaudible]
just
everybody
knew
that
section
7
didn't
apply
to
banks.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
discuss
the
other
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
discuss
the
other
four
under
section
7.
i
don't
understand?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
raising
your
claims
under
7?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
he
ever
borrowed
any
money
and
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
percentage
of
the
next
largest
bank?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
have
is
a
combination
of
the
two
largest
banks,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
will
leave
two
large
banks.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
does
that
figure
--
what's
the
relative
figure
or
percentage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
anyone
of
them
testify
that
increased
competition
to
the
extent
that
the
banks
from
which
this
man
was
testifying
might
have
to
lend
money
at
a
lower
rate?
