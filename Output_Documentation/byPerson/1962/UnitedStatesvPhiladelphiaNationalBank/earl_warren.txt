et

mr.
price
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
wondering
if
this
merger
is
permitted,
would
the
argument
that
you
are
making
today
also
apply
in
the
event
of
this
new
merged
bank
sought
to
merge
with
the
next
largest
bank
in
philadelphia.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
there
still
be
larger
banks
in
new
york
that
could
loan
still
more
money?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
wouldn't
the
same
argument
apply
then
if
you
took
a
next
biggest
bank?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
not
if
there
is
no
area
there
in
around
philadelphia,
those
four-counties
don't
constitute
in
the
area,
when
you
are
in
competition
with
new
york,
why
couldn't
you
make
the
same
argument
to
take
the
next
biggest
bank
and
then
the
next
one
after
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
â€“
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
a
little
while
ago
that
a
third
of
your
business
was
commercial
business
was
outside
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
you
indicated
is,
there
is
no
competitive
disadvantage,
would
you
mind
telling
us
why
the
--
or
what
the
federal
reserve
bank
said
made
it
anti
competitive?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
you'd
judge
that
--
is
that
what
they
said?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
littleton,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
just
one
question
about
the
federal
insurance
deposit
corporation,
did
they
express
an
opinion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
looking
at
page
18
and
i
notice
that
the
one
with
the
lowest
concentration
in
any
of
these
110
cities
is
the
one
that
you
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there
is
no
one
over
21%
there
and
you
already
have
36%.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
if
that
doesn't
have
any
affect
on
you,
why
do
the
rest
of
these
figures
or
why
are
they
so
important
that
the
new
york
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
new
york
figure
that
is
your
greatest
competitor
you
say,
the
one
that
is
taking
all
your
business
away
doesn't
have
more
than
21%
concentration
in
any
one
of
its
biggest
banks,
why
then
do
these
others
that
have
different
percentages
help
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
chicago
only
has
25?
