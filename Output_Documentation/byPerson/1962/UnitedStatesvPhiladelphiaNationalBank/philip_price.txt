mr.
philip
price
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
we
will
divide
our
argument.
i
will
discuss
the
facts,
how
banks
operate,
what
the
evidence
was
--
actually
was
that
was
presented
to
the
court
below
by
the
appellant
and
what
the
evidence
was
presented
by
the
appellees
and
so
make
a
very
brief
reference
to
the
clayton
act.
mr.
littleton
will
discuss
the
sherman
act
and
the
effect
of
the
sherman
act
in
this
case
and
the
facts
with
particular
reference
to
the
bank
merger
act
of
1960
and
it's
effect
as
well
as
the
effect
of
the
legislative
history
upon
the
popular
interpretation
of
the
rule
of
reason
under
the
sherman
act
if
your
honors
suggest
so
far.
first,
this
case
is
brought
in
the
name
of
the
united
states,
but
the
government
does
not
properly
--
mr.
philip
price
i'm
going
to
cover
the
inapplicability
of
clayton
act
to
this
case.
although,
this
case
is
brought
in
the
name
of
the
united
states,
the
government
is
not
properly
the
appellant.
this
essentially
is
a
dispute
between
two
branches
of
the
government,
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice
and
the
comptroller.
the
comptroller
decided
this
merger
question,
on
the
basis
of
the
public
interest
as
he
was
authorized
to
do
under
the
bank
merger
act
of
1960.
as
he
was
required
to
do,
he
asked
for
the
advice
or
the
suggestions
of
the
attorney
general,
the
department
of
justice,
the
federal
reserve,
the
fdic
in
respect
only
of
their
opinion
on
the
effect
of
this
merger
on
competition,
probably
without
regard
to
whether
the
public
interest
was
involved,
that
wasn't
their
function.
the
department
of
justice
and
the
federal
reserve
and
to
some
extent
the
fdic
reported
that
in
their
opinions
the
effect
of
the
merger
on
competition
would
be
deleterious.
the
only
evidence
that
we
have
in
the
case
on
that
subject
is
the
evidence
presented
by
the
department
of
justice
which
the
court
below
found
to
be
totally
inadequate
to
sustain
its
opinion.
no
evidence
whatever
from
either
the
federal
reserve
or
the
fdic,
except
the
x
party
statement
which
appeared
in
the
form
of
their
two
reports.
no
witnesses
were
called
to
explain
those
statements.
no
witnesses
were
called
to
give
the
basis
for
the
opinions
expressed,
and
therefore
as
the
court
below
pointed
out,
there
was
no
more
validity
suggested
as
to
those
then
there
was
as
to
the
opinion
expressed
by
the
attorney
general,
which
he
found
to
be
completely
unfounded.
but
this
case
involves
a
charge
of
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
under
the
clayton
act
in
respect
of
two
banks
in
philadelphia.
it
has
nothing
whatever
to
do.
with
the
mergers
which
may
or
may
not
take
place
will
be
contemplated
in
new
york
and
chicago
and
lexington
and
in
other
places.
it
involves
solely
the
question
of
whether
these
two
banks,
the
federal,
girard,
and
the
philadelphia
national
bank
in
philadelphia,
may
properly
merge
without
violation
of
the
sherman
act
and
if,
and
whether
on
the
contrary
that
merger
would
constitute
an
improper
and
excessive
diminution
in
competition
in
philadelphia
and
excess
of
concentration.
those
are
the
only
two
things
charged
in
the
complaint
which
had
been
pursued
since
the
original
complaint.
now
the
court
below,
contrary
to
what
has
been
suggested
a
moment
ago,
decided
this
case
purely
as
a
question
of
fact.
this
court
is
asked
to
review
and
to
reverse
the
court
below
purely
on
questions
of
fact.
the
court
below
assumed
that
the
clayton
act
applied,
but
held
that
it
was
not
violated.
it
held
that
the
sherman
act
applied
and
decided
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
it
was
not
violation.
so
that,
for
this
court
to
reverse,
the
district
court
would
require
it
to
declare
that
the
finding
of
the
facts
of
the
court
below
were
clearly
erroneous
and
in
order
to
oppose
this
subject
to
the
understanding,
it's
necessary
to
consider
two
things.
first,
what
is
the
need
to
banking;
second,
what
was
the
evidence
presented
to
the
court
below
which
led
it
to
the
conclusion
which
it
announced.
now,
banking
is
essentially
different
from
general
industry,
from
manufacturing
and
the
complete
failure
of
the
department
of
justice
to
understand
and
give
effect
to
this
difference
is
probably
what
is
the
fundamental
basis
for
this
case,
and
certainly
is
the
fundamental
basis
for
the
argument
that
has
been
presented,
both
orally
and
in
the
brief.
now
i
shall
like
to
say
first
something
about
the
background
situation
as
it
existed
in
the
philadelphia
which
led
to
this
merger
proposal.
until
1950,
these
two
banks
were
essentially
wholesale
banks,
wholesale
is
a
colloquial
term
applied
to
banks
which
deal
in
large
sums,
preferably
large
deposits
and
large
levels.
for
example,
in
the
early
days
the
philadelphia
national
bank
was
probably
reluctant
to
accept
a
deposit
of
less
than
$10,000.
the
girard
for
many
years
had
only
10,000
depositors
and
as
girard's
have
said
they
now
have
over
200,000.
deposits,
individual
deposits,
and
corporate
deposits
up
in
the
millions
of
dollars
in
demand
deposits
were
quite
common
and
it
was
a
bank,
or
banks
which
dealt
largely
in
that
type
of
business
that
were
called
wholesale
banks.
they
were
looked
down
upon
the
retail
bank
business
done
by
the
smaller
banks
because
that
involved
a
lot
more
trouble
and
handling
small
amounts
of
money
and
large
number
of
deposits.
however,
probably
1933
when
it
became
unlawful
to
pay
interest
on
the
demand
deposits,
both
private
depositors
and
corporate
depositors
concluded
that
they
shouldn't
leave
millions
of
dollars
on
deposit
earning
nothing
and
with
the
added
sophistication
of
corporate
treasures,
those
moneys
were
drawn
out
in
large
quantities
and
invested
in
short-term
government
bonds,
in
commercial
paper,
in
time
deposit.
so
that
the
demand
deposits,
for
which
the
bank
could
not
pay
any
interest
were
translated
so
far
as
they
could
be
into
time
deposits
where
they
had
to
pay
the
interest
in
order
to
get
them.
the
result
of
that
was,
that
the
banks
were
required,
these
wholesale
banks
were
required
to
seek
elsewhere
for
the
cash
which
they
had
to
have
to
increase
their
deposit
account,
because
although
it
was
suggested
a
moment
ago
that
the
deposits
were
not
too
significant,
actually
a
bank
can't
exist
without
deposits.
it
can't
do
business
without
deposits.
deposits
constitute
approximately
90%
of
the
resources
of
a
commercial
bank
and
therefore
if
the
deposits
were
withdrawn
the
bank
would
collapse,
it
couldn't
possibly
do
its
business
with
simply
this
capital
and
surplus.
so
that
the
banks
sought
this
other
source
of
money,
and
that
required
it
go
into
the
retail
business.
that
trust
could
transfer
large
sums
in
the
aggregate,
but
small
individually
to
the
suburbs
of
philadelphia,
led
the
banks
to
pursue
their
customers
in
the
suburbs
and
in
the
course
of
doing
so
they
merged
with
the
local
country
banks
who
then
were
too
small
to
handle
the
influx
of
business
that
had
come
from
the
city.
and
together
the
combination
produced
a
benevolent
result
as
it
was
testified
to
by
the
only
witness
called
by
the
appellant,
who
knew
anything
whatever
about
philadelphia,
and
that
was
professor
key.
he
said
these
mergers
were
beneficial.
they
were
necessary
in
order
that
the
banks
might
keep
up
with
the
growing
business
in
the
community
and
it
was
good
for
everybody.
mr.
philip
price
i'm
speaking
now
about
the
mergers
which
were
promoted
and
prompted
and
made
necessary
by
the
movement
of
capital
to
the
country.
those
are
the
mergers
which
were
equal
--
mr.
philip
price
but,
it's
not
this
much.
mr.
philip
price
that's
correct,
yes
sir,
quite
enough.
in
addition
however
--
mr.
philip
price
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
price
i
can
do
it
very
briefly
by
saying
that
the
banks,
as
business
grew,
the
small
banks
became
totally
incapable
of
handing
and
they
lost
business
and
could
only
stay
alive
at
all
by
merging
with
a
larger
bank,
that's
the
point
of
view
of
the
smaller
bank.
the
point
of
view
with
a
large
moving
into
the
country,
it
was
the
only
way
it
could
get
into
the
surrounding
area
because
of
the
restrictions
upon
opening
new
branches.
so
that
it
was
not
only
a
marriage
of
convenience
but
of
a
great
advantage
to
both
and
it
resulted
in
the
diminution
of
the
number
of
banks,
but
a
great
increase
in
the
number
of
branches.
so,
that
there
are
now
some
300
branches
in
the
four-county
area
and
although
there
were
fewer
banks,
only
17
banks.
along
with
this
movement
of
the
country
and
the
growth
of
activities
locally,
there
was
a
great
improvement
in
the
business
situation
in
philadelphia
and
its
surroundings
so
that
the
amount
of
business
that
required
banking
accommodation
greatly
increased.
that
is
shown
with
the
exhibits
in
the
case,
in
the
growth
of
business
in
the
surrounding
area
but
there
was
a
great
lag
in
the
growth
of
banks
so
that
the
largest
banks
in
philadelphia
became
totally
unable
to
handle
the
business
which
came
to
them
by
virtue
of
they
being
in
the
same
area
and
these
big
businesses
which
had
outgrown
the
local
banks
then
were
forced
to
go
and
did
go
to
many
cities,
but
smaller
than
philadelphia
but
which
had
banks
larger
than
philadelphia.
for
example
pittsburgh,
which
had
a
bank
then
with
a
$25
million
lending
limit
which
was
produced
by
mergers
incidentally.
there
is
a
bank
in
boston
which
had
$20
million.
there
is
a
bank
in
cleveland
which
has
more,
dallas
$10
million.
so
that
these
business
people,
went
not
only
to
new
york
in
large
numbers
which
has
17
banks
with
a
lending
limit
in
an
excess
of
a
$1
million,
but
they
went
to
these
other
cities
as
well.
there
were
41
banks
in
philadelphia,
the
four-county
area,
handling
all
the
local
business,
but
the
large
business
went
elsewhere
because
it
couldn't
be
handled
locally.
now,
banking
is
essentially
different
from
commerce
or
the
manufacturing
business
itself
and
it
is
this
that
should
be
--
is
recognized
by
the
court
below
following
the
guide
that
was
given
to
it
by
congress.
when
the
congress
had
before
it
this
bank
merger
act
of
1960,
the
house
report
says,
banking
offers
problems
acutely
different
from
other
types
of
business.
the
senate
report
said,
it's
impossible
to
require
unrestricted
competition
in
the
field
of
banking
and
impossible
to
subject
banks
to
the
rules
applicable
to
ordinary
industrial
and
commercial
concerns.
and
senator
robinson
who
is
the
chairman
of
the
committee
on
banking
and
currency
said,
banking
is
too
important
to
permit
unrestricted
competition.
it
is
impossible
to
subject
bank
mergers
to
the
clayton
act
under
which
a
merger
would
be
barred
if
it
might
tend
substantially
to
lessen
competition
regardless
of
the
effects
on
the
public
interest.
and
it
was
that
approach
that
led
the
comptroller
to
reach
the
conclusion
which
he
did,
and
which
is
now
challenged
not
on
the
ground
stated
by
congress
as
the
reasons
why
merger
should
be
allowed
but
on
this
very
limited
statistical
approach
of
the
department
of
justice.
the
fundamental
difference
between
banking
and
manufacturing
is
this.
when
a
bank
lends
all
the
money
that
is
in
the
till
it
has
to
quit,
it
can't
make
any
more.
it's
not
the
bureau
of
engraving
and
printing.
it
can't
continue
to
manufacture
money
and
unless
it
gets
more
deposits
which
are
purely
the
voluntary
act
of
some
private
individual
or
a
company,
it
has
to
go
out
in
lending
business
until
the
loans
are
paid
off
or
until
more
deposits
come
in
and
that's
because
the
deposits
are
90%
of
the
resources
that
were
available
to
any
bank
to
lend
to
it's
customers.
only
10%
is
due
to
the
capital
and
surplus
of
the
bank
but
90%
to
the
deposits
and
therefore
it
is
completely
dependent
upon
the
uncontrolled
will
of
depositors
who
can
come
and
go
as
they
please
and
do
as
they
please.
mr.
philip
price
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
when
we
recessed
yesterday
i
had
just
challenged
the
statement
in
that
a
bank
has
any
control
over
its
deposits.
i'd
like
to
give
two
illustrations.
some
years
ago
in
pennsylvania,
the
secretary
of
banking
refused
to
permit
any
bank
to
allow
more
than
3%
on
--3%
or
2.5%
or
3%
on
its
current
deposits,
at
a
time
when
new
york
allowed
a
half
or
1%
more
than
that.
until
the
secretary
of
banking
of
pennsylvania
changed
that
regulation,
$3
million
moved
out
of
the
philadelphia
national
bank
to
new
york
without
any
power
on
the
part
of
the
bank
to
control
that
move.
another
illustration;
in
new
york
city
over
a
period
of
six
months,
a
$150
million
moved
out,
was
withdrawn
from
term
deposits
of
new
york
banks;
because
of
a
slight
difference
in
the
interest
rate
it
was
possible
to
earn
a
whole
lot
amount
of
money.
that
represented
the
amount
of
cash
that
would
have
provided
commercial
and
industrial
loans
of
$90
million
and
as
for
as
demand
deposits
are
concerned,
of
course
by
definition,
they
are
withdrawable
by
the
depositor
without
notice.
simply
a
check
will
withdraw
all
the
money
on
demand
deposit
without
prior
notice
to
the
bank
and
the
bank
has
absolutely
no
control
over
it.
therefore,
the
number
of
deposits
or
the
fact
that
the
deposits
does
not
constitute
anything
in
the
nature
of
control
that
is
similar
to
the
kind
of
control
that
we
talk
about
when
we
were
speaking
of
manufacturing
company.
there
is
no
possibility
therefore
of
the
price
war
such
as
were
suggested
in
the
brief
of
the
appellant.
there
is
no
power
to
control
anyone
because
money
is
the
only
commodity
that
banks
handle
and
that
is
fluent,
it
moves
rapidly
throughout
the
country
at
no
cost
and
therefore,
can
be
transferred
from
one
city
to
another
by
mail,
by
telegraph
and
practically
by
telephone.
now
the
three
functions
of
the
commercial
bank
essentially
involve
the
deposit
activity
and
the
lending
activity
and
the
collateral
services
that
are
rendered
by
the
bank.
there
is
no
competition,
no
price
competition
for
deposits,
because
banks
may
not
allow
any
interest
except
that
which
is
permitted
by
law
and
regulations
and
that
applies
to
everybody.
so
there
can't
be
any
advantage
for
one
bank
over
another
in
that
field.
banks
have
to
operate
within
the
limits
prescribed
by
regulation,
which
amounts
to
the
character
of
investments
they
may
make,
but
loans
have
to
be
short
term
to
be
liquid,
they
may
not
be
more
than
10%
of
the
capital
surplus
of
the
company
--
of
the
bank,
which
means
in
a
fact
that
they
may
not
be
more
than
about
1%
of
the
aggregate
deposits
of
the
bank.
loans
may
not
exceed
60%
of
the
deposits
ordinarily
or
about
six
times
the
capital
of
the
bank.
60.5%
must
be
kept
on
deposit
with
the
federal
reserve
as
cash
reserve
and
an
addition
secondary
reserve
must
be
kept
by
the
bank
itself
as
a
hedge
against
the
possibility
of
sudden
and
unacceptable
withdrawals.
so
that
the
operation
of
a
bank
is
entirely
different
from
any
manufacturing
company
and
its
stock
in
trade,
cash,
is
subject
to
withdrawal
practically
without
notice.
the
term
deposits
of
course
30,
60,
90
days
there
was
that
much
notice,
but
when
the
time
runs
out,
the
money
maybe
withdrawn
without
any
explanation
whatever.
so
far
as
deposits
are
concerned,
there
is
no
competition
insofar
as
loans
are
concerned.
there
are
no
price
of
competition
in
loans,
because
the
interest
rate
is
in
effect
fixed
by
the
operations
of
the
federal
reserve
in
controlling
the
volume
of
money
that's
available
to
banks.
for
example,
the
open
market
operations
which
the
federal
reserve
buys
and
sells
some
$30
billion
worth
of
government
securities,
can
either
withdraw
cash
from
the
banks
and
therefore
reduce
the
capacity
of
the
banks
to
lend
or
put
cash
into
the
banks
when
the
federal
reserve
buys
bonds,
buys
[inaudible]
and
that
makes
money
easier
and
therefore,
interest
rates
might
be
affected.
so
that
the
control
of
interest
rates
is
not
in
the
hands
of
the
bank
stocks,
but
in
the
hands
of
federal
reserve
itself.
the
aggregate
money
market
in
the
united
states,
the
free
quick
money
market
is
in
excess
of
$500
billion.
the
amount
that
any
one
bank
has
under
its
capacity
to
lend
is
vastly
less
than
that
and
therefore,
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
any
bank
to
exercise
any
control
over
the
money
market
so
far
as
loans
are
concerned.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
this
--
operations
of
small
bank
in
terms
in
relation
to
enlargement.
within
its
resources,
within
its
capacity
to
lend
with
10%
limit,
the
lending
limit
of
the
bank
itself,
a
small
bank
can
compete
as
effectively
with
a
large
bank
as
two
large
banks
with
one
another.
that
was
justified
too
by
all
the
witnesses
who
had
any
knowledge
of
the
operations
of
banking.
and
in
that
connection,
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
foolishness
referred
to
yesterday
of
the
three
banks.
it
was
suggested
that
the
court
below
indicated
that
if
this
merger
went
through,
it
will
be
prepared
to
approve
mergers
indefinitely
until
we
were
reduced
to
three
banks.
nothing
can
be
further
from
the
fact.
the
three-bank
question
came
up
in
this
way,
several
witnesses
testified
that
so
far
as
out
in
to
choices
on
the
part
of
a
borrower
were
concerned,
that
if
a
borrower
were
turned
down
by
three
banks,
you
probably
didn't
have
a
bankable
loan
and
he'd
have
to
go
some
place
other
than
to
a
commercial
bank
to
get
a
combination.
therefore,
the
court
below
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
any
limitation
upon
competition
here,
in
this
case,
considered
that
testimony
about
three
banks
and
said
that
in
those
circumstances
and
the
circumstances
plus
the
evidence
in
the
case,
17
banks
in
philadelphia
provided
ample
alternate
choices
for
any
perspective
borrower
for
any
possible
banking
need
that
he
might
have
and
that
the
41
banks
in
the
four-county
area
provided
just
that
much
more.
mr.
philip
price
no
sir,
no
sir.
i
was
speaking
only
about
banks
not
so
all
the
court
was
speaking
about
in
connection
with
those
three.
they
also
going
to
get
money
from
insurance
companies,
they
get
money
from
factors;
they
get
money
from
other
sources.
but
speaking
purely
and
simply
of
the
commercial
loan,
still
there
were
ample
alternate
choices
for
any
needs
of
the
average
borrower.
mr.
philip
price
but
they
would
have
to
go
but
--
mr.
philip
price
well,
but
it
was
based
upon
this
suggestion
that
three
banks
would
be
enough
to
provide
what
was
needed
of
competition
wise
and
otherwise
for
the
area.
that
of
course
ignores
the
authority
of
the
comptroller
to
determine
whether
in
the
public
interest
it
would
be
better
or
worse
to
have
three
or
more
or
less
than
three
banks
in
philadelphia
--
mr.
philip
price
there
are
7000
of
those,
sir.
over
7000
have
only
one
bank.
great
many
have
only
two
or
three,
but
here
we're
talking
out
about
a
particular
situation
which
is
philadelphia
where
they
have
17
to
start
with,
they
have
41
in
the
four-county
area,
they
have
116
in
the
ten-county
area.
and
when
you
get
up
above
the
level
of
the
lowest
loans
10,000
and
50,000
loans,
you
immediately
become
in
competition
with
new
york
where
there
are
17
banks
that
have
lending
limits
of
100
of
a
million,
over
a
million
dollar.
eight
which
have,
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
philip
price
in
new
york,
the
17
have
a
million
dollar
lending
limit,
eight
have
a
$10
million
lending
limit,
six
a
15
and
three
have
a
lending
limit
in
excess
of
the
aggregate
of
all
the
lending
limits
of
all
the
philadelphia
banks
put
together.
mr.
philip
price
the
need
of
the
community
that
have
banks
--
a
bank
that
can
handle
its
own
needs.
the
defendants
produced
the
testimony
of
seven
or
eight
business
people,
large
businesses,
chief
executive
officers
of
large
businesses
who
said
that
they
would
prefer
being
in
the
philadelphia
area
to
borrow
from
philadelphia
banks,
but
they
were
forced
go
primarily
to
new
york,
but
also
to
chicago,
to
boston,
to
pittsburgh,
to
cleveland,
to
dallas
to
get
the
money
that
they
needed
to
operate.
mr.
philip
price
the
additional
business
justification
is
the
added
money
that
would
be
brought
to
philadelphia
by
having
business
connections
of
that
sort
who
deposit
large
sums
in
the
philadelphia
bank
from
which
the
competitive
bankers
in
the
philadelphia
testified
they
all
would
benefit,
they
welcomed
this
merger
because
they
said
it
would
bring
more
money
to
philadelphia,
more
business
to
philadelphia
and
that
all
the
banks
including
the
smaller
ones
would
benefit
from
it.
mr.
philip
price
every
bank
has
a
competitive
advantage
over
every
other
bank
based
upon
difference
in
size,
because
under
the
law,
a
bank
may
not
lend
more
than
10%
of
its
capital
and
surplus.
so
that
a
bank
that
can
lend
$1
million
has
a
competitive
advantage
over
a
bank
that
may
lend
over
a
$100,000
and
similarly
a
bank
has
a
$15
million
lending
limit
has
a
competitive
advantage
over
one
that
may
lend
only
10,
but
the
competitive
advantage
is
measured
by
the
difference
of
the
resources,
which
under
the
law,
one
may
use
and
the
other
may
not.
so
that
it
does
not
take
away
business
from
a
smaller
bank,
because
within
the
resources
of
the
smaller
bank,
each
one
is
on
a
par.
it
only
gives
it
an
additional
feel
within
which
it
may
operate,
which
the
smaller
bank
never
had
and
can't
have
under
the
law.
mr.
philip
price
that
is
so,
but
that's
merely
because
of
the
resources.
it's
the
natural
result
of
having
limited
resources
as
contrasted
with
unlimited
resources
relatively
speaking,
so
that
a
--
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
bigger
bank
can
take
something
away
from
the
smaller
bank,
the
smaller
bank
just
can
handle
to
start
with.
and
in
philadelphia,
the
fact
that
we
haven't
got
a
bank
that
can
handle
this
business
drives
it
to
new
york
where
it
can
be
handled,
where
it
is
handled,
which
now
being
handled
by
the
banks
there,
which
have
this
so
far
competitive
advantage.
now
the
purpose
of
this
merger
is
to
make
for
the
first
time,
a
philadelphia
bank
competitive
with
larger
banks
in
new
york
and
elsewhere
with
which
they
can't
compete
now
simply
because
it's
too
small.
mr.
philip
price
no,
sir
you
can't
tell
that,
because
unless
some
perspective
borrower
comes
in
and
said
i
would
have
borrowed
this,
you
don't
know.
mr.
philip
price
they
were
seven
or
eight
business
people
did
testify.
one
said
he
put
a
loan
of
$10
million
in
new
york,
$10
million
in
chicago.
another
one
he
put
so
much
elsewhere,
so
that
they
were
seven
or
eight
illustrations
of
it,
but
obviously
the
fish
that
got
away
that
didn't
even
nibble,
could
not
be
measured
and
therefore
it
was
maybe
a
matter
of
judgment.
mr.
philip
price
curiously
enough
that
exhibit
which
he
described
to
the
banks
and
said
they
didn't
adequately
explain
it,
it
is
shown
on
the
face
of
the
paper
by
as
being
government
exhibit
181.
so
that
apparently
he
didn't
understand
his
own
exhibits.
that
shows
that
loans
over
a
millions
dollars
of
these
particular
ones
which
were
calculated
in
1955
from
somewhat
incomplete
statistics
were
made
to
borrowers
outside
the
four-county
area
and
34
were
inside
the
four-county
area,
that's
all
that
means,
but
it
doesn't
purport
to
indicate
the
number
that
was
--
mr.
philip
price
oh,
certainly,
oh,
yes
sir.
oh,
yes,
indeed.
mr.
philip
price
not
at
all.
mr.
philip
price
they
do
as
34
--
i
think
34%
of
their
commercial
business
is
done
outside
the
four-county
area,
64%
in
dallas.
mr.
philip
price
borrowers
outside
the
four-county
area,
oh
yes.
mr.
philip
price
no,
not
clients
within
the
area,
borrowers
outside
the
area.
there
is
a
large
business
done
with
customers
who
have
no
connection
with
philadelphia
at
all,
where
competition
with
new
york
banks,
but
can't
meet
them
beyond
relatively
limited
amount
mr.
philip
price
yes,
sir.
that
was
the
opinion
of
the
bankers,
not
only
the
bankers,
the
members
of
the
staffs
of
the
two
appellees,
but
the
bankers
who
were
competitors,
the
seven
or
eight
bankers
who
testified
as
competitors
that
they
welcome
this
merger
because
they
expected
to
bring
this
additional
business
to
philadelphia
area
for
the
benefit
of
them
and
business
generally.
mr.
philip
price
the
fact
that
you
have
deposits
makes
it
available
for
local
loans
as
well
as
--
mr.
philip
price
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
philip
price
that
is
the
normal
practice
of
borrowers
and
the
evidence
showed
here
that
of
the
large
borrowers,
a
million
dollars
and
up,
the
philadelphia
national
bank
had
deposits
of
about
twice
the
amount
of
the
loans.
so
they
had
a
100%
more
available
for
local
use.
the
girard
had
about
50%
more,
so
that
is
the
definite
advantage
that
comes
from
bringing
money
in
from
the
outside,
which
the
appellant
brushes
off
by
saying
they
don't
believe
it,
but
the
evidence
shows
that
was
the
result
of
such
a
visit.
my
time
is
up,
but
i
would
like
to
say
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
about
clayton
act,
a
word
about
it
and
why
it
doesn't
apply?
the
clayton
act
when
amended
in
1950
to
extend
asset
acquisitions
was
extended
only
to
asset
acquisitions
by
companies,
which
were
subject
to
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
banks
are
not
and
therefore,
the
banks
were
not
covered
with
section
7.
and
the
attorney
general
for
the
last
ten
years
has
been
actively
turned
up
the
swayed
congress
to
amend
the
law
so
as
to
include
banks
within
its
scope.
congress
has
persistently
refused
to
do
so.
and
therefore,
what
the
appellant
is
asking
this
court
to
do
here
is
not
only
to
legislate,
but
to
legislate
in
a
way
in
which
congress
for
ten
years
has
refused
to
do.
i
read
yesterday
a
brief
excerpt
from
a
statement
by
senator
robertson
and
i
will
add
only
one
more
to
it
which
is
in
full
volume,
who
said
it
is
this
and
this
is
in
discussion
of
the
1968,
it
is
this
distinction
between
banking
and
another
business,
which
justifies
different
treatment
for
bank
mergers
and
other
mergers
and
which
led
the
senate
to
reject
the
flat
prohibition
of
the
clayton
act
test,
which
applies
to
other
mergers.
so
that
i
suggest
here
they're
trying
to
get
this
court
to
do
something
that
the
congress
has
persistently
refused
to
do
and
therefore,
its
price
there
--
mr.
philip
price
i
can
understand
why
he
would
not
want
to
discuss
it
orally
and
that
suggests
also
i
can
see
why
he
would
try
to
burst
out
with
all
and
to
suggest
also
a
perfectly
good
reason
by
congress
confided
to
the
comptroller,
rather
than
to
antitrust
department,
the
department
of
justice,
the
responsibility
for
deciding
whether
a
merger
was
in
the
public
interest
or
not.
now,
we
go
to
mr.
littleton.
mr.
philip
price
it
would
have
less
validity,
because
it
would
then
be
in
competition
and
able
to
complete
with
these
larger
banks
in
new
york,
which
it
now
cannot
compete
with
and
would
be
able
to
hold
business
or
gain
business,
which
now
is
completely
outside
of
its
capacity
to
handle.
mr.
philip
price
there
would
–-
mr.
philip
price
because
there
are
not
so
many
more
than
a
$15
million,
i
said
that
there
are
only
six
of
those
in
new
york.
now
the
three
that
are
enormously
large,
and
there
would
be
no
necessity
for
anybody
to
achieve
a
55
or
60
or
$65
million
lending
limit
in
order
to
handle
the
businesses
in
philadelphia
that
may
be
in
new
york
mr.
philip
price
because
our
argument
is
confined
to
the
business
that
originates
in
the
philadelphia
area
and
this
is
--
the
philadelphia
area
does
not
yet
need
a
lending
limit
anything
approaching
$50
million.
mr.
philip
price
it
was
testified.
mr.
philip
price
that's
correct,
but
it
isn't
in
the
$55
million
test.
$15
million
would
put
us
in
competition
with
six
of
the
largest
banks
in
new
york,
which
we
can't
compete
with
now
and
that
would
be
enough
to
take
care
of
the
normal
needs
of
the
philadelphia
business,
which
now
has
to
go
to
new
york,
because
they
want
loans
in
the
range
of
$10
to
$12
million.
now
if
at
some
future
day,
business
in
philadelphia
required
loans
of
$50
or
$60
million
that
bridge
can
be
crossed
at
the
time.
what
mr.
jennings
testified
that
the
reason
for
the
so
called
concentration,
which
is
found
objectionable
by
the
appellants,
is
to
meet
the
existing
need
in
particular
localities
of
business,
the
local
business.
now,
we
are
not
trying
to
take
business
away
from
new
york,
we
are
trying
to
keep
business
in
philadelphia
which
now
goes
to
new
york
because
it
can't
be
held,
can't
be
handled
at
all.
mr.
philip
price
the
participation
is
explained
in
considerable
detail
in
the
findings
of
fact
and
the
opinion
and
i
will
summarize
it
only
this
way
sir.
they
participate
with
correspondent
banks
to
help
them
out,
smaller
banks
as
their
correspondents,
but
they
don't
participate
themselves,
banks
or
loans
which
are
in
the
$10
or
$15
to
$20
million
class.
any
participation
there
is
made
by
and
directed
by
the
borrower,
not
by
the
banks
themselves.
mr.
philip
price
because
it's
much
too
much
trouble
for
large
banks
--
large
borrowers
to
establish
commercial
relationships
with
a
number
of
banks.
if
they
can
go
to
one
bank
and
get
their
entire
needs.
the
banks
that
borrow
a
$150
or
$200
or
$300
million,
i
mean
the
businesses
that
borrow
that,
obviously
can't
go
to
any
one
bank.
those
are
banks
that
already
have
established
commercial
relationship
all
over
united
states.
so
that
when
they're
borrowing
a
$100
million,
they
are
passing
out
to
bank
abcd
throughout
the
country,
the
amount
that
they
want
intact
and
usually
that's
$10
million
to
$15
million
top
limit.
but
banks
themselves
do
not
participate,
in
their
point
of
view,
they
may
lose
a
customer.
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
customer,
the
customer
doesn't
want
to
be
bothered
with
that
