mr.
lee
loevinger
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
antitrust
case
that
comes
up
on
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
philadelphia.
the
suit
seeks
to
enjoin
the
merger
of
the
philadelphia
national
bank
referred
to
in
the
briefs
in
sometimes
as
pnb
and
the
girard
bank
on
the
grounds
that
the
merger
violates
the
antitrust
laws.
the
district
court
found
that
the
sherman
act
applied
to
the
transaction,
but
that
it
was
not
violated.
the
application
of
the
sherman
act
is
not
an
issue
on
this
appeal,
but
its
violation
is.
the
controlling
facts
are
largely
statistical
and
they're
not
disputed,
although,
there
is
substantial
disagreement
as
to
their
interpretations.
the
crucial
questions
raised
by
this
case
are
(a)
does
an
area
in
which
firms
conduct
all
of
their
business
compete
with
each
other
and
encounter
the
preponderant
part
of
their
competition
constitute
a
relevant
market
for
a
merger
case
and
(b)
does
the
combination
by
a
merger
of
firms
controlling
more
than
one-third
of
a
large
market
constitute
unreasonable
lessening
of
competition
or
restraint
of
trade.
the
government
contends
that
both
questions
must
be
answered
yes.
the
issues
arise
in
this
fashion;
philadelphia
national
and
girard
bank
are
located
across
the
street
from
each
other
at
broad
and
chestnut
streets
in
philadelphia.
philadelphia
national
has
27
branches
and
girard
has
38
branches.
all
of
these
are
in
philadelphia
or
the
three
adjoining
counties
of
montgomery,
delaware
and
bucks.
by
law,
the
philadelphia
banks
are
permitted
to
have
branches
or
conduct
banking
business
only
in
these
four
counties.
these
four
counties
are
referred
to
in
the
record
and
here
as
the
philadelphia
metropolitan
area
or
the
philadelphia
area.
philadelphia
national
has
over
$1
billion
in
assets.
girard
has
about
three
quarters
of
a
million
dollars
in
assets.
the
merged
bank
would
have
one
and
three
quarter
billion
dollars
in
assets
or
37%
of
all
banking
assets
in
the
philadelphia
area.
the
merged
bank
would
be
50%
bigger
than
the
second
biggest
bank,
three
times
as
large
as
the
third
bank
and
would
have
more
assets
than
all
of
the
other
37
banks
in
the
philadelphia
area
put
together.
the
reasons
given
for
the
merger
are
that
it
would
give
the
merged
bank
a
larger
lending
limit
and
thus
bestow
prestige
upon
it.
mr.
potts,
the
president
of
the
philadelphia
national
bank
testified
then
in
his
judgment,
the
most
important
benefit
of
the
merger
to
the
two
banks
would
be
the
prestige
factor,
which
would
include
a
larger
lending
limit.
now,
this
lending
limit
is
the
maximum
above
that
a
bank
can
loan
to
any
single
borrower,
and
amounts
go
above
10%
of
the
capital
and
surplus
of
the
bank.
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir,
it
would.
this
is
their
contention
that
it
would
enable
the
merged
bank
to
compete
with
the
banks
in
new
york
or
loans
exceeding
the
lending
limit
of
the
two
banks,
which
are
$6
million
for
girard
and
$8
million
for
philadelphia
national.
in
other
words,
it
would
enable
them
to
compete
in
the
market
or
submarket
for
multimillion
dollar
loans,
which
as
i
shall
show
the
court,
constitutes
approximately
one
one-hundredth
of
1%
of
the
entire
banking
market
in
which
these
companies
are
engaged
or
what
i
would
submit
to
the
court
is
this
most
microscopic
submarket
that
has
ever
been
presented
to
this
court
in
an
antitrust
case.
mr.
lee
loevinger
there
are
five
other
banks
in
--
well,
there
are
no
banks
in
philadelphia,
your
honor,
that
are
eligible
to
make
loans
of
$15
million.
there
are
five
other
banks
in
philadelphia
that
are
eligible
to
make
loans
over
$1
million
and
therefore
in
the
plus
million
or
multimillion
dollar
submarket.
the
precise
number
in
the
united
states
is
not
specified
in
the
record
and
there
certainly
are
some
in
new
york,
but
the
alleged
reason
for
the
merger
was
to
enable
these
banks
to
compete
in
this
multimillion
dollar
submarket
with
the
new
york
banks.
this
was
the
precise
finding
and
it
was
this
view
that
led
the
district
court
to
the
conclusion
that
philadelphia
is
not
a
relevant
market
in
which
to
test
the
competitive
effects
of
the
merger,
because
the
banks
had
this
competition
for
multimillion
dollar
loans
with
the
new
york
banks.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no
sir,
this
is
the
number
of
customers
of
the
two
banks
who
are
interested
in
the
multi-million
dollar
loans.
the
two
banks
between
them,
i
have
the
figures
later
in
my
presentation.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir,
of
these
two
banks.
mr.
lee
loevinger
i'm
talking
about
the
amount
of
loans
over
$1
million,
one-tenth
of
1%.
these
banks
have
$6
million
and
$8
million
lending
limits
now.
one-tenth
of
1%
of
their
customers
have
taken
loans
over
$1
million.
and
one-one
hundredth
of
1%
of
their
customers
have
ever
taken
or
sought
loans
over
$5
million.
$5
million
is
well
within
the
lending
limit
of
both
banks
now,
so
that
the
--
what
they
are
talking
about
is
the
ability
to
engage
in
a
wholly
speculative
sub-
market,
because
there
isn't
even
any
showing
in
this
record
that
they
would
get
a
single
customer
who
would
take
from
them
a
loan
in
excess
of
$8
million.
there
is
a
showing
that
there
are
a
total
of
nine
loans
in
excess
of
$5
million,
out
of
a
total
of
over
a
120,000
loans
that
these
companies
have
in
the
philadelphia
area.
this
is
the
magnitude
of
the
relative
markets
that
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case.
mr.
lee
loevinger
it's
$15
million;
actually
it's
$1
million
more
than
the
combination
of
the
$6
million
and
$8
million
because
they
intend
to
transfer
some
money
from
profits
to
surplus.
mr.
lee
loevinger
there
is
some
testimony
that
there
are
some
loans
in
the
multi-million
dollar
range
in
philadelphia,
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
sir?
mr.
lee
loevinger
the
only
evidence
on
that
is
the
1955
survey
of
the
federal
reserve
board
that
shows
that
there
is
something
--
that
there
is
$113
million
loaned
in
philadelphia
by
new
york
banks.
there
is
no
indication
how
many
loan
this
is
or
in
what
amount.
actually
the
evidence
in
the
record
shows
that
there
are
loans
that
banks
participate
in
that
these
banks
themselves
have
participated
in,
ranging
as
high
as
a
$162
million
for
a
single
loan.
so
this
113
might
represent
one
or
two
or
three
loans,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate.
the
government
contends
that
the
error
--
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
there
were
some
general
statements
of
that
character
made,
yes
sir
and
that
is
what
the
bank
is
arguing.
mr.
lee
loevinger
there
is
no
evidence
supporting
that
sir.
the
appellees
called
a
half
a
dozen
representatives
of
large
business
in
philadelphia.
all
of
them
testified
that
they
had
accounts
in
new
york
as
well
as
in
philadelphia.
they
have
loans
and
some
of
them
have
loans,
not
all
of
them
have
loans
from
these
banks,
none
of
them
were
at
or
near
the
lending
limit
of
these
banks.
all
of
them
have
connections
with
new
york
banks.
they
testified
without
exception,
they
would
continue
their
connections
with
new
york
banks,
most
of
them
were
a
large
national
companies,
as
indeed
these
big
business
customers
of
these
banks
are,
and
these
large
national
companies
have
accounts
with
literally
hundreds
of
banks
throughout
the
united
states
and
they
do
not
intend
to
change.
there
was
no
testimony
from
any
single
witness
as
i
recollect
the
record
that
said
that
any
loan
would
be
brought
to
these
banks
in
excess
of
their
present
lending
limit,
if
their
lending
limit
were
enlarged.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
some
of
them,
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no
sir,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
that's
so.
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
to
assume
that
this
occurred
other
than
by
the
product
of
natural
growth
in
the
market.
these
people
talk
a
lot
about
meeting
the
market
demands
and
it
is
our
position
that
they
are
perfectly
at
liberty
to
meet
the
market
demands.
if
the
market
demands
a
bank
of
that
size
in
philadelphia,
these
banks
will
grow
to
that
size
of
the
market.
however,
for
them
by
what
this
court
itself
has
characterized
as
the
abnormal
or
unnatural
means
of
swallowing
up
competitors
for
them
to
take
this
step
of
engulfing
the
market
is
contrary
to
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
have
no
recollection
on
the
subject
sir
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
mr.
lee
loevinger
we
have
a
merger
case
pending
in
chicago.
mr.
lee
loevinger
many
of
these
banks
have
merged
and
these
banks
themselves
have
previously
merged.
philadelphia
national
has
had
nine
previous
mergers
and
girard
six,
if
i
recollect
correctly.
there
has
been
a
lot
of
merger
and
they
have
testified
that
these
mergers
were
with
smaller
banks
in
order
to
give
them
branches
throughout
the
area
in
order
to
enable
them
to
serve
their
customers,
including
their
big
customers
incidentally
and
there
has
been
no
objection
raised
to
these
mergers.
but
there
is
a
difference
between
a
large
central
city
bank
controlling
on
the
one
hand
21%
and
another
one
controlling
16%
of
the
banking
assets
in
a
community
merger
or
a
bank
merging
with
small
outlying
bank
where
the
percentage
control
of
banking
assets
of
the
community
is
relatively
insignificant,
and
it
is
this
difference
that
we
say
is
significant
in
this
case.
mr.
lee
loevinger
10%
of
the
assets
of
the
capital
and
surplus
sir.
so
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
i'm
not
a
sufficient
expert
in
banking
accounting
to
tell
you
and
it
wasn't
explored
in
the
record.
mr.
lee
loevinger
sir.
no
deposits
i
think
are
not
included.
mr.
lee
loevinger
sir?
mr.
lee
loevinger
well,
it's
at
least
$80
million
because
they
have
an
$8
million
lending
limit.
their
total
assets
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
sir?
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes,
i
believe
so,
the
assets
are
approximately
$1
billion
for
one
bank
and
three
quarters
of
a
billion
for
the
other.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
the
federal
reserve
board
and
fdic.
now,
the
points
that
i
hope
to
cover
in
argument
are
first,
that
the
most
relevant
market
for
this
case
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
[inaudible]
without
saying.
mr.
lee
loevinger
we
opposed
it
in
representations
to
the
comptroller
prior
to
the
approval,
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
the
federal
reserve
board
opposed
it
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
lessen
competition
in
the
philadelphia
market,
specifically.
the
position
of
the
federal
reserve
board
is
specifically
set
forth
in
our
brief.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no
sir.
this
is
the
federal
reserve
board,
the
federal
reserve
board
of
governors
in
washington.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no
sir,
but
their
report
on
this
matter
is
in
evidence
in
full.
now
the
points
that
i
shall
seek
to
make
are
first
that
the
most
relevant
market
for
this
case
clearly
is
the
philadelphia
area
for
a
number
of
reasons,
because
the
banks
involved
do
all
of
their
business
there
and
indeed
are
authorized
by
law
to
do
business
only
within
the
philadelphia
area.
the
banks
complain
that
the
demarkations
of
political
sub-units
are
arbitrary
and
indeed
they
are,
in
a
sense,
as
all
market
limits
are
arbitrary,
however
in
this
case
they
are
less
arbitrary
than
usual
because
the
limits
of
these
political
subdivisions
are
the
legal
limits
of
the
authority
of
the
banks
here
to
do
business.
in
the
second
place,
the
customers
in
this
area
require
local
banks
for
their
banking
service
as
the
appellees
themselves
have
shown.
in
the
third
place,
over
95%
of
all
the
customers
of
both
banks
involved
here
are
residents
of
this
area.
in
the
fourth
place,
outside
competition
exists
for
only
fraction
of
1%
of
the
customers
in
this
area,
as
i
shall
demonstrate
and
finally
because
the
banks
involved
here
actually
compete
with
each
other
in
this
area
in
every
phase
of
banking.
my
second
point
is
that
the
merger
will
give
the
resulting
bank
control
of
more
than
one-third
of
all
the
banking
business
done
in
this
market.
my
third
point
is
that
the
combination
by
merger
of
large
and
viable
firms
controlling
more
than
one-third
of
a
market
as
vast
as
this,
lessens
competition
and
restraints
trade
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
a
holding
here
that
acquisition
of
such
a
market
share
is
legal
would
sanction
the
reduction
by
merger
of
the
number
of
competitors
in
this
or
any
similar
market
to
no
more
than
three.
this
result,
i
submit,
is
completely
inconsistent
with
the
competitive
market
structure
and
with
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
let
me
address
myself
to
the
issue
of
the
market.
the
discussion
of
the
market
in
terms
of
the
relevant
markets
suggest
that
there
is
or
maybe
a
single
unique
discrete
area
that
can
be
identified
as
the
market.
this
of
course
is
erroneous
and
misleading.
the
market
is
simply
a
conceptual
tool
for
the
analysis
of
complex
economic
phenomenon.
markets
overlap,
and
any
single
enterprise
competes
in
a
number
of
different
markets.
a
market
is
always
surrounded
by
a
peripheral
area
in
which
trade
crosses
its
arbitrary
boundaries
and
the
outer
limits
of
all
markets
are
vague
and
fuzzy.
this
was
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
times
picayune
case
in
which
i
believe
mr.
justice
clark
said,
“the
"market,"
as
most
concepts
in
law
or
economics,
cannot
be
measured
by
metes
and
bounds
nor
does
the
substance
of
sherman
act
violations
typically
depend
on
so
flexible
a
guide.”
now,
the
market
that
is
to
be
applied
in
antitrust
cases
has
been
laid
down
by
this
court
in
standard
stations
and
the
tampa
electric
case
in
which
it
is
said
that
since
preservation
of
competition
is
the
object
under
the
antitrust
laws,
the
area
of
effective
competition
between
the
parties
is
the
relevant
market.
this
concept
has
been
applied
in
numerous
cases
such
as
paramount
where
you
held
first
run
theaters
in
a
single
city
to
be
a
relevant
market
or
international
boxing,
in
which
championship
boxing
matches
as
distinguished
from
all
other
boxing
matches
were
held
to
be
a
relevant
market
and
in
which
the
court
said
that
definition
of
the
part
of
trade
or
commerce
encompassed
by
the
sherman
act
involves
distinctions
in
degree
as
well
as
in
kind,
which
is
illustrated
in
the
application
of
the
sherman
act
to
trade
or
commerce
in
a
localized
geographical
area.
now
the
court
here
found
that
commercial
banking
viewed
collectively
with
the
relevant
line
of
commerce
of
product
market
and
this
is
not
contested
and
it
is
not
an
issue
on
the
appeal.
the
banks
insist
that
the
mode
of
competition
among
commercial
banks
is
unique
and
they
argue
that
it
consists
primarily
of
convenience
and
quality
rather
than
a
price.
actually,
there
is
substance
to
this
argument,
that
they
don't
carry
a
fine.
that
the
point
is
that
banks
sell
only
service,
of
course
banks
deal
in
money
as
all
businesses
deal
in
money,
but
this
isn't
the
commodity
that
they
are
selling.
what
they
are
selling
is
service
and
all
of
the
service
that
these
banks
render,
they
render
within
the
philadelphia
area.
all
of
their
banking
offices
are
there,
all
of
their
deposits
are
received
there.
all
of
their
books
of
accounts
are
received
there.
all
their
loans
are
disbursed
there.
all
their
officers
and
employees
are
employed
there.
now,
what
the
controversy
in
this
case
arises
out
of
is
the
fact
that
although
all
their
business
is
done
in
philadelphia,
some
of
it
is
done
with
nonresident
individuals
or
corporations
and
this
is
the
source
of
the
mass
of
statistics
that
you'll
find
in
the
record.
however,
there
are
two
points
to
note
in
connection
with
this.
in
the
first
place,
the
nonresidents
constitute
a
very
small
minority
of
the
customers
of
both
banks.
this
again
is
sometimes
obscured
by
the
presentation
of
these
statistics
in
dollar
figures
rather
than
in
terms
of
the
number
of
customers,
but
the
nonresidents
is
minute
percentage,
really,
of
the
total
number
of
customers
involved
here.
in
the
second
place,
the
nonresidents
no
less
than
the
residents
who
do
business
in
philadelphia
require
banking
service
in
philadelphia.
mr.
lee
loevinger
there
is
no
showing
that
there
are
any
of
these
beside
from
a
couple
of
dollar
figures,
the
1955
survey
that
i
refer
to,
sir.
the
testimony
is
and
the
testimony
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
there
is
no
showing
that
this
by
residents
of
the
philadelphia
area.
this
may
very
well
be
by
nonresidents.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
worthwhile
to
take
the
time
to
burden
the
court
with
some
of
the
figures
or
not,
but
just
to
give
you
an
idea,
the
total
number
of
checking
accounts
in
both
banks
is
236,000,
the
number
of
savings
and
time
accounts
in
both
banks
is
about
240,000.
in
both
cases,
the
number
by
the
bank's
own
statistics,
the
number
of
accounts
by
nonresidents
is
less
than
5%.
over
95%
of
all
checking
accounts,
savings
account
and
time
deposits
are
held
by
people
who
are
classified
as
residents.
mr.
lee
loevinger
those
are
in
the
bank
statistics,
i
don't
have
them
at
my
fingertips.
mr.
lee
loevinger
it's
of
some
relevance.
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
don't
say
that
they're
totally
irrelevant
but
i
do
say
this
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
no,
this
is
the
point
your
honor.
mr.
lee
loevinger
i'm
sure
that
the
appellees
will
have
these
figures
your
honor.
i
don't
have
the
figures.
they're
in
the
appellees'
briefs
as
a
matter
of
fact
by
dollar
amounts,
but
my
point
is
simply
this.
assuming
that
there
are
large
amounts
involved
by
a
few
customers
who
are
able
to
go
to
new
york
and
the
testimony
of
the
president
of
the
girard
bank
and
of
other
witnesses
was
that
a
customer
who
desired
to
borrow
$1
million
or
more
could
go
to
another
city,
but
that
the
smaller
customers
were
confined
to
their
local
area
and
there
is
no
conflict
about
this
testimony,
assuming
that
there
are
large
amounts,
even
assuming
that
there
was
substantially
more
customers
than
the
record
shows,
this
still
does
not
make
philadelphia
either
not
a
market
or
not
relevant.
the
important
thing
is
that
philadelphia
is
a
relevant
market.
of
course
there
are
other
markets
that
these
banks
may
compete
in,
and
of
course
there
are
some
large
amounts
involved
in
some
of
these
other
things,
although
compared
to
the
total
they
are
not
large,
but
the
--
i'm
sorry
in
our
brief
at
page
34,
using
the
appellees'
figures
we
show
the
distribution
by
amounts.
for
example
the
demand
deposits
of
individuals
by
amount
89%
of
the
demand
deposits
of
individuals
are
from
residents
of
the
philadelphia
area.
the
demand
deposits
of
corporations
and
partnerships
71%,
of
time
and
savings
deposits
88%
of
amount.
ipc
that's
individual
partnership
and
corporation
deposits
79%
of
the
amount
is
from
residents
of
the
area
and
so
forth.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
well
the
two
banks
represent
the
following
percentages
of
the
total
amounts
of
the
various
categories.
the
numbers
refers
only
to
trust.
now,
the
taking
commercial
and
industrial
loans
all
together
which
are
the
ones
principally
in
issue
here
and
these
are
set
forth
in
our
appendix,
it
will
be
seen
that
there
are
just
70
out
of
over
7,000
commercial
and
industrial
loans
that
are
over
$1
million.
therefore
of
commercial
--
of
the
sub-market
of
commercial
and
industrial
loans,
there
is
just
1%
that
lies
or
less
than
1%
that
lies
in
this
sub-market
of
multi-million
dollar
loans.
but
when
you
add
to
these
7,000
commercial
and
industrial
loans
the
115,000
or
120,000
loans
to
all
the
residents
of
the
philadelphia,
the
philadelphia
area
and
these
are
the
residents
of
the
philadelphia
area
according
to
defendants'
own
exhibits,
120,000
loans,
the
70
loans,
the
70
business
loans
in
the
multi-million
dollar
markets
shrink
to
one-one
hundredth
of
1%
by
number
of
customers
of
the
people
served
by
these
two
banks.
and
i
simply
submit
that
regardless
of
how
much
is
done
in
amount
by
one-one
hundredth
of
1%
of
the
total
number
of
people
served,
i
don't
say
that
that's
unimportant
to
be
disregarded.
i
do
say
that
you
cannot
disregard
the
99%
and
99
one-hundredths
percent
of
the
customers
who
are
served
in
the
less
than
million
dollar
market
and
that's
what
the
court
below
did.
the
court
below
said
that
philadelphia
was
not
a
relevant
market.
now
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
that
any
area
in
which
99
and
99
one-hundredths
percent
of
the
customers
that
you
serve
reside
is
not
a
relevant
market.
mr.
lee
loevinger
not
the
factual
findings,
no
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
district
court
clearly
misconceived
the
legal
concept
of
the
market
and
the
legal
intent
and
the
nature
of
competition,
as
this
court
has
outlined
it
and
as
all
economic
and
legal
students
of
the
subject
have
said
it
to
be.
it
is
just
a
misconception
of
the
facts.
there
is
no
real
dispute
as
to
the
facts.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no,
but
this
is
irrelevant.
this
is
how
they
do
it,
a
baby
grows
more
than
an
adult
but
this
doesn't
mean
that
the
adult
has
no
advantage
of
size.
of
course,
the
small
banks
are
growing
faster.
small
businesses
in
any
field
will
grow
faster
measured
as
the
court
measured
them,
measured
in
terms
of
percentage,
a
bank
that
starts
in
business
with
$1
million
or
$2
million
will
increase
very
rapidly
in
percentage
size,
but
the
growth
of
all
the
small
banks
in
the
philadelphia
area
put
together
is
a
small
fraction
of
the
total
growth
of
these
two
banks
involved
here
and
would
be
an
even
smaller
fraction
of
the
merged
bank.
the
merged
bank
is
not
going
to
grow
on
percentage
terms
because
it's
just
too
big
to
grow
in
percentage
terms.
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
wouldn't
say
per
se,
no
we
are
not
arguing
for
per
se
rule
here,
but
where
there
is
no
other
business
reason
that
the
merger
of
two
banks
in
a
large
market
which
together
between
them
control
more
than
a
third
of
the
market
means
that
this
court
must
adhere
to
the
same
rule
for
other
banks
and
that
therefore
this
court
is
holding
that
no
more
than
three
banks
are
required
in
any
banking
market,
and
i
say
--
submit
that
this
is
not
what
competition
mean,
this
is
what
the
antitrust
laws
means.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
is
what
the
defendant
themselves
say
the
situation
should
be.
the
defendant
themselves
have
argued,
they
argued
in
their
emotion
to
affirm,
their
witness
mr.
jennings
got
on
the
stand
and
they
have
a
finding
to
the
effect,
that
three
banking
alternatives
are
all
that
anyone
needs.
however,
i
submit
that
this
reduction
of
a
market
to
a
very
small
segment
of
a
few
sellers
is
precisely
what
the
competition
does
not
mean,
is
in
consistent
with
what
this
court
has
said
it
means
and
with
what
it
has
been
held
to
mean.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir
the
columbia
steel
case
i
think
is
wholly
inapplicable.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
columbia
steel
case
supports
our
view
with
respect
to
the
market.
in
the
columbia
steel
case,
u.s.
steel
sought
to
acquire
consolidated
steel
and
u.s.
steel
sold
the
overwhelming
part
of
its
business
outside
of
the
nine-state
area
in
which
consolidated
did
business.
the
court
however
held
that
the
area
in
which
consolidated,
the
acquired
company
did
business
was
the
relevant
market
for
that
--
for
purposes
of
that
case
because
this
was
where
competition
would
be
effected,
if
at
all.
incidentally,
in
the
columbia
steel
case
consolidated
did
do
business
in
the
national
market,
but
this
court
noted
that
its
business
in
the
national
market
was
one-half
of
1%
and
dismissed
this
as
being
of
no
significance,
that
is
far
greater
than
the
percentage
participation
in
the
national
market
of
the
girard
and
philadelphia
national
banks
here.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
overwhelming
proportion
of
the
business
of
the
two
concerns
involved
here
is
in
fact
done
in
the
philadelphia
area.
therefore,
by
the
rule
of
the
columbia
steel
case,
you
must
take
that
area
as
the
relevant
market,
for
purposes
of
judging
the
effect
of
the
merging.
mr.
lee
loevinger
23%
sir,
but
the
court
noted
that
this
was
a
declining
and
unstable
percentage
in
girard
of
very
special
circumstances
which
had
to
do
with
war
production.
if
your
honor
will
recall
this
came
up
shortly
after
world
war
ii,
i
think
it
was
1946,
1947.
it
actually
reached
this
court
in
1948,
and
the
court
noted
that
the
exceptional
circumstances
of
the
market,
of
that
market
and
of
the
national
market
made
the
market
shares
then
held
very
unstable.
it
noted
for
example
that
the
market
share
of
united
states
steel
had
been
declining
from
some
40%,
45%
down
to
about
30%
or
29%.
incidentally
the
horizontal
competition
that
was
involved
was
that
in
structural
steel
products.
consolidated
--
only
16%
of
consolidated's
output
was
in
structural
steel
products.
so
that
the
percentage
of
extinction
--
the
extinction
of
competition
related
to
a
smaller
percentage
of
the
market,
a
declining
percentage
of
the
market,
a
questionable
percentage
of
the
market
and
a
very
minor
percentage
of
the
business
of
consolidated
as
well
as
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
business
of
the
acquired
company.
here
the
contrary
is
true
that
this
is
a
much
larger
percentage
of
the
market,
a
growing
percentage
of
the
market,
a
stable
percentage
of
the
market
and
it
involves
something
between
95%
and
100%,
or
if
you
want
to
figure
it
by,
even
by
these
methods
of
figuring
something
between
80%
and
90%
of
the
business
done
by
the
companies
involved
here.
it's
a
wholly
different
situation
factually.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
36
are
derived
from
non
residents
of
the
four-county
area
and
34
derived
from
residents
of
the
four-county
area
that's
true
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
well
this
is
the
way
that
statistics
comes
to
us.
it
was
never
explored
in
the
record.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
some
exploration
in
the
record
of
defendants'
exhibit
26
and
defendants'
exhibits
40
which
reported
to
list
their
largest
customers
by
domicile
and
it
was
ascertained
that
on
defendants'
exhibit
40
which
had
47
of
largest
customers
of
girard
all
of
them
had
main
offices
or
important
offices
in
the
philadelphia
area,
26
which
had
the
27
largest
customers
of
philadelphia
national,
23
definitely
had
main
offices
or
important
offices
in
the
philadelphia
area,
one
was
in
camden,
new
jersey,
and
one
in
baltimore,
and
two
were
unknown.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no
sir,
it
means
that
34
are
from
businesses
that
are
domicile
within
the
four-counties
and
36
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
don't
know
the
record
simply
doesn't
explore
these
subjects
sir
except
--
some
of
the
exhibits
there
was
cross
examination
most
of
them
there
was
not.
we
simply
took
this
--
the
government
attorneys
took
the
statistics
that
they
came
from
appellees.
mr.
lee
loevinger
this
might
well
be
the
case.
mr.
lee
loevinger
well,
the
significance
i
give
to
that
fact
sir
is
that
there
are
just
34
people
who
come
to
these
banks
for
loans
over
a
million
dollars
from
outside
the
four-county
area
and
that
that
is
very,
very
few
when
compared
to
the
120,000
customers
that
they
have
for
loans
within
the
four-county
area.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
it
might
very
well,
yes
sir.
that's
exactly
the
case.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
this
is
a
distinction
that
permeates
the
record.
now,
i
could
nip
it
in
any
event
it
is
immaterial
where
most
of
these
people,
where
these
loans
came
from
and
they
certainly
in
the
absence
of
some
showing
that
there
is
a
necessity
for
them
to
do
business
outside
because
what
they
are
doing
is
selling,
banking
service
inside
the
philadelphia
area.
they
themselves
stress
the
fact
that
they're
selling
service
and
we
agree
that
they're
selling
service,
they
are
not
selling
money;
they're
selling
banking
service.
they're
like
banking
service
stations
that
have
65
branches
within
this
four-county
area.
when
a
motorist
comes
to
a
service
station
for
service
he
may
have
a
new
jersey
or
new
york
or
a
honolulu
license
plate
but
he
want
service
at
the
place
of
that
service
station
philadelphia
or
washington
or
wherever
it
is.
when
people
come
to
philadelphia
for
banking
service,
the
unique
and
the
distinctive
and
the
valuable
thing
that
they
are
the
getting
there
is
not
a
different
kind
of
money
it's
a
different
location.
they
want
banking
service
in
the
philadelphia
area.
insofar
as
there
is
a
multi-million
dollar
banking
loan
market,
the
appellees
now
are
fully
qualified
and
do
participate
in
it
and
there
are
extensive
exhibits
in
the
record
showing
their
participation
in
the
so
called
participation
loans,
loans
ranging
all
the
way
from
$5000
to
a
$160
million
in
which
they
have
incidentally
participations
ranging
from
under
$5000
to
over
$5
million,
but
in
none
of
these
multi-million
dollar
loans
in
which
they
participate
is
there
is
the
extent
of
their
participation
in
excess
of
$5
million
or
even
close
to
their
lending
limits.
now
the
--
i
think
that
it
is
therefore
fair
to
say
that
the
philadelphia
area
that's
been
limited
is
a
market.
of
course
there
are
other
markets.
we
don't
deny
that
there
are
national
markets
and
that
there
are
perhaps
even
international
markets.
all
we
say
is
that
simply
because
there
are
other
markets
and
simply
because
these
banks
may
have
some
participation
whether
it
is
small
as
i
say
it
is
or
slightly
larger
is
immaterial,
the
degree
of
that
participation
is
essentially
material,
that
where
they
have
an
important
participation
in
an
area
like
philadelphia
as
large
as
it
is
with
as
many
customers,
with
as
many
billions
of
dollars
involved,
this
is
a
relevant
market.
within
this
relevant
market
you
can
measure
their
market
share
by
indisputable
figures.
they
have
37%
of
the
assets.
they
have
36%
of
all
the
deposits.
they
have
39
--
they
will
have
if
they
are
merged
to
have
49%
of
all
the
deposits
of
other
banks
held
by
philadelphia
banks.
they
will
have
34%
of
all
the
loans
of
philadelphia
banks.
they
will
have
65
offices
or
nearly
one-forth
of
all
the
banking
offices
in
the
philadelphia
area.
this
market
share
then
represents
the
proportion
of
the
banking
business
done
in
philadelphia
and
controlled
by
these
two
banks
which
is
all
the
banking
service
that
is
available
to
99
or
99
and
nine-tenths
percent
of
the
residents
of
philadelphia
who
are
not
in
the
multi-million
dollar
loan
category.
99
and
nine-tenths
of
a
percent
of
those
people
who
seek
loans
from
banks
in
philadelphia,
seek
loans
of
less
than
a
million
dollars.
as
to
these
people,
they
are
relinquished
to
the
philadelphia
banking
assets
and
if
the
merger
is
permitted,
these
banks
will
control
more
than
one-third
of
these
banking
assets.
now,
the
banks
contend
of
market
shares
have
a
different
significance
in
banking
than
they
do
in
other
businesses,
because
as
they
say
banks
do
not
own
the
funds
they
lend,
they
owe
them
and
the
bank
cannot
prevent
its
depositors
from
withdrawing
demand
deposits
at
any
time.
in
fact,
however,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
clear
that
market
shares
are
more
firmly
established
in
banking
than
they
are
in
most
lines
of
commerce.
there
is
a
continuing
relationship
between
banks
and
their
customers
that
does
not
exist
in
other
businesses.
customers
for
shoes
or
gasoline
or
milk
can
readily
change
the
seller
without
notifying
the
seller.
a
bank
depositor
or
a
bank
borrower
can't
payoff
his
loan
or
withdraw
his
deposits
without
notifying
the
bank.
it
requires
significant
effort
for
him
to
go
out
and
get
a
substitute
bank.
further
banks
are
used
as
financial
reference
sources
to
control
business
opportunities.
the
need
for
geographical
convenience
is
been
stressed
by
the
bank
themselves,
in
numerous
applications
for
branches
which
are
in
evidence
and
as
well
in
their
own
testimony.
a
business
or
a
professional
man
cannot
afford
to
incur
the
ill-will
of
an
important
banker.
consequently
bank
customers
are
very
slow
and
low
change
which
was
confirmed
again
by
the
testimony
of
mr.
potts,
president
of
philadelphia
national,
who
said
that
if
there
is
one
fact
“that
banks
know
about
it,
is
that
of
a
nurture
and
the
depositors
are
very
low
to
change
their
accounts
except
for
good
cause.”
therefore,
this
brings
you
to
the
controlling
question
of
whether
the
combination
by
merger
of
banks
controlling
one-third
of
a
market
of
this
size
is
a
restraint,
a
prey.
now,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
all
of
the
competition
between
the
bank
themselves
would
be
wholly
extinguished,
this
was
found
by
the
court
and
there
is
no
denying
it.
the
court
however
says,
that
the
--
because
this
will
reduce
the
number
of
banks
in
the
philadelphia
area
by
only
one,
that
it
will
not
have
the
affect
of
substantially
restraining
competition
or
affecting
competition.
mr.
lee
loevinger
well,
that's
section
7
sir.
i'm
arguing
--
section
7
is
argued
in
the
brief
and
we
are
relying
on
it,
but
i
simply
don't
have
time
to
cover
both
sections.
i'm
relying
on
section
1,
because
i
think
that
the
restraint
is
so
perfect,
is
so
clear,
that
section
1
fairly
invalidates
this
merger
and
the
court
need
to
proceed
no
further.
our
point
on
section
7
follows
a
fortiori.
now,
the
decision
in
the
present
case
was
issued
in
january
of
1962
which
was
some
months
before
the
decision
of
this
court
in
brown
shoe.
consequently
the
court
below
relied
on
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
american
crystal
sugar
case
and
used
the
so
called
qualitative
substantiality
test.
however,
i
submit
that
the
court
--
in
the
first
place
this
court
has,
i
think
somewhat
repudiated
that
test
but
even
if
it
had
not,
that
had
the
court
below
read
the
district
court's
opinion
in
american
crystal
sugar,
which
was
affirmed
and
expressly
endorsed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
it
would
have
found
that
the
rule
of
the
american
crystal
sugar
case
expressly
disavows
the
basis
upon
which
the
present
case
rests.
in
american
crystal
sugar,
there
were
two
small
companies,
neither
one
of
which,
there
weren't
small,
but
the
two
substantial
companies,
but
neither
one
of
which
were
or
were
to
be
come
by
merger
the
leaders
in
the
industry
who
together
proposed
to
combine
13%
of
the
market
and
they
said
that
by
combining
13
x
13%
of
the
market
they
could
better
compete
with
the
industry
leaders.
the
district
court
alone
said
this
is
not
what
competition
means
for
large
companies
to
compete
in
order
better
to
compete
with
giant
companies
and
it
held
the
merger
was
forbidden
and
that
is
the
very
heart
of
the
case
that
the
appellees
made
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
argument
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
--
has
i
think
best
been
met
by
the
words
of
the
judge
weinfeld
in
the
bethlehem
steel
case,
which
i
submit
deserved
the
specific
approbation
of
this
court.
judge
weinfeld
said,
“congress
and
its
efforts
to
preserve
the
free
enterprise
system
and
the
benefits
to
flow
to
the
nation
and
to
the
consumer,
did
not,
in
enacting
the
antitrust
laws,
intend
to
give
free
play
to
the
balancing
power
of
gigantic
enterprises
and
leaves
the
less
powerful
purchaser
helpless,
but
congress
thought
to
preserve
as
a
social
and
economic
order
not
dependent
on
the
power
of
a
few
to
take
care
of
themselves.
and
this,
as
of
matter
of
fact,
is
very
close
to
the
words
of
chief
justice
warren
dissenting
in
the
dupont
case,
although
i
think
that
the
court
did
not
disagree
with
him
on
this
point
where
he
said
a
few
sellers
tend
to
act
like
one,
in
industry
which
does
not
have
a
competitive
structure,
will
not
have
competitive
behavior.
the
public
should
not
to
be
left
to
rely
upon
the
dispensations
of
many
in
order
to
obtain
the
benefits
which
normally
accompany
competition.
such
beneficence
is
of
uncertain
tenure
only
actual
competition
can
assure
long
run
enjoyment
of
the
goals,
of
a
free
economy.
i
think
that
we
can
best
test
the
positions
of
the
government
and
of
the
banks
in
this
case
by
examining
the
practical
consequences
of
projecting
these
positions
beyond
the
case.
the
government
position
would
not
impede
the
growth
of
large
banks
by
expansion
to
meet
market
demands
and
it
would
permit
the
merger
of
any
but
the
largest
banks
holding
dominant
positions
in
their
local
markets.
the
government
position
would
ensure
the
preservation
of
a
substantial
number
of
large,
vigorous,
and
competitive
banks
in
markets
of
size
of
philadelphia.
the
bank
position,
on
the
other
hands
they
argued,
would
clearly
and
certainly
permit
the
reduction
of
banks
in
any
market
to
no
more
than
three
in
any
event.
the
bank
position
would
carry
to
it's
logical
conclusion,
which
says
that
the
local
market
is
irrelevant
and
we
can
look
at
the
national
market
would
permit
the
merger
of
even
these
three
in
any
markets
smaller
than
new
york
in
order
to
permit
the
banks
to
compete
with
the
larger
new
york
banks.
thus,
the
logical
result
of
the
bank
position
would
be
that
we
would
end
by
having
a
single
market
in
every
market
smaller
than
new
york
and
probably
have
only
three
alternatives
or
competitors
left
in
new
york.
i
think
that
there
cannot
possibly
be
any
position,
any
choice
between
these
alternatives
nor
any
doubt
as
to
which
one
congress
intended
this
court
to
make
as
between
the
two
of
them.
i
would
like
to
save
the
reminder
time
for
rebuttal
if
it
pleases
the
court.
mr.
lee
loevinger
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
there
has
been
a
little
misapprehension
about
that,
your
honor.
the
court
below
held
that
it
did
apply
to
banks.
it
was
held
that
it
did
apply
to
banks
by
the
court
of
the
third
circuit
in
the
transamerica
case.
the
argument
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
transaction
involved
here
comes
within
the
scope
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
as
an
acquisition
of
stock
rather
than
assets.
i'd
like
not
to
get
into
that
because
it's
a
narrow
technical
point.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no,
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
the
court
below
held
that
it
does
and
it
has
been
held
that
its
does,
i
think
it's
clear
that
it
does.
the
question
is,
as
to
the
character
of
the
transaction
and
because
of
the
narrowness
of
that
point.
i
would
rather
rest
it
on
my
brief
than
proceed
to
the
discussion
of
the
merits
of
this
case.
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
think
the
case
is
so
clear
under
section
7
that
there
is
no
use
discussing
it
and
i
want
to
discuss
the
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
because
there
is
a
question
as
to
the
character
of
the
transaction
involved
here
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
a
stock
rather
than
an
asset
acquisition.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes,
sir,
but
i
think
that
the
restraint
of
competition
in
this
case
is
so
clear
that
the
issue
ultimately
presented
to
this
court
and
which
this
court
should
decide
is
whether
a
restraint
in
a
market
as
large,
important
and
significant
as
philadelphia
can
be
justified
by
an
alleged
or
supposed
advantage
in
a
small
national
submarket
or
a
small
national
market
for
multi-million
dollar
loans.
this
is
the
business
justification
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
was
talking
about
and
that
i
think
is
the
crux
of
the
case
and
perhaps
i
should
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
no
sir,
i
am
resting
on
the
brief,
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes,
sir
this
case
is
complex
and
difficult
and
that
involves
enough
figures
as
it
is,
without
getting
into
the
technicalities
of
the
precise
transaction
and
as
to
whether
stock
or
asset
acquisition
involved
in
this
long
agreement
drafted
by
philadelphia
lawyers.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no,
sir.
i
think
that
you
got
exactly
the
same
problem.
i
think
there
isn't
any
real
dispute
as
to
the
fact.
i
think
real
dispute
is
that
the
legal
test
applied
by
the
lower
court.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no,
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no,
sir.
i
disagree
wholly
with
your
honor,
and
i'd
like
to
tell
you
why.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
not
live
testimony
as
it
has
been
represented.
for
example,
this
alleged
testimony
about
gary,
indiana
was
testimony
by
mr.
jennings
who
had
one
time
had
been
a
deputy
assistant
comptroller,
but
is
now
president
of
the
largest
bank
in
texas
and
was
at
that
time
that
he
testified.
and
his
testimony
was
that
he
thought
that
there
was
plenty
of
competition
in
gary,
indiana
even
though
it
had
approximately
90%
of
its
assets
in
one
bank.
and
he
is
the
man
who
testified
and
this
is
the
testimony
they
rest
on
that
the
two
banking
alternatives
is
plenty
for
anybody
who
is
seeking
a
bank
loan.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no
sir,
he
didn't.
[laughter]
the
banks
have
referred
to
this
table
on
18
as
heart
of
their
case.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
concentration
ratio
was
essentially
inverse
to
the
size
of
the
community.
and
that
new
york
and
chicago
as
the
chief
justice
noted
are
close
to
the
[inaudible]
now,
it
is
true
that
we
didn't
call
any
people
from
all
of
these
100
communities,
they
mentioned
saint
paul,
minneapolis
and
duluth.
it
might
be
of
interest
to
know
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
witnesses
in
those
cities
from
the
banks
were
being
called
before
a
grand
jury
and
within
the
last
two
weeks
we've
returned
three
indictments
and
filed
three
civil
antitrust
suits
in
saint
paul,
minneapolis
and
duluth
with
respect
to
banking.
i
don't
think
that
they
can
make
very
much
out
of
that.
as
far
as
live
witnesses,
the
fact
is
that
the
banks
themselves
called
no
live
witnesses
from
the
other
six
to
eight
banks
in
philadelphia.
they
called
banks
only
from
small
--
witnesses
from
small
satellite
banks
that
have
large
deposits
or
that
held
stock
in
one
of
the
banks
involved
in
the
present
merger.
further,
it
is
perfectly
clear
as
we
point
in
our
reply
brief
that
when
these
banks
say
that
competition
would
be
increased
what
they
are
saying
is
in
the
words
of
one
of
the
witnesses,
competition
will
get
worse.
we're
going
to
have
to
work
harder
and
compete
harder
in
the
face
of
the
advantages
of
the
merged
bank
in
order
to
maintain
our
place.
this
is
what
they
mean
when
they
say
that
competition
will
be
increased
or
competition
will
remain
the
same,
because
the
merged
bank
will
have
so
much
of
an
advantage
that
the
other
banks
will
be
at
a
disadvantage.
now,
it's
true
that
we're
resting
on
statistics
to
a
large
extent,
but
i
take
it
that
this
means
that
what
we
are
using
is
facts
instead
of
speculation
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
page
18
of
our
reply
brief,
for
example.
there
is
all
this
talk
about;
you
need
a
big
lending
limit
in
order
to
compete
with
the
new
york
banks.
now
here
are
the
--
according
to
the
defendant's
own
exhibit,
exhibit
1
here
are
the
amounts
of
loans
in
other
cities
that
the
new
york
banks
have
ranged
according
to
size.
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
of
the
cities
that
had
more
loans
from
new
york
banks,
most
of
them
have
larger
lending
limits
in
philadelphia.
there
is
simply
no
relationship
between
this
large
lending
limit
and
the
amount
of
business
done
in
a
community
by
the
new
york
banks.
that
business
done
in
a
community
by
the
new
york
banks
is
governed
by
the
need
for
the
specialized
kind
of
services
that
the
defendant's
own
witnesses
testified
they
got
from
the
new
york
banks
in
the
international
market
with
respect
to
specialized
oil
departments
and
other
things
of
precisely
this
character.
now,
when
you
talk
about
business
justification,
the
best
example
or
the
best
evidence
of
what
the
business
justification
can
be
in
this
national
multi-million
dollar
market
is
what
it
actually
has
been.
it's
very
easy
for
a
banker
to
get
up
and
say,
well,
we'd
like
to
compete
with
the
bank
of
london
and
the
chase
manhattan
and
these
big
banks,
we
would
love
to
be
in
this
big
market.
what
have
they
done?
both
these
banks
here
have
ample
lending
limits
and
ample
funds
to
get
into
the
multi-million
dollar
market
now
and
so,
they
can
loan
up
to
$6
million
and
$8
million
respectively.
there
are
$5
million
or
more
loans
amount
to
9
in
total
number
and
$56
million
in
total
amount.
this
is
less
than
one
one-hundredth
of
a
percent
of
the
total
number
of
loans
less
than
6%
of
the
total
amount
of
loans.
so
that
for
this
market
or
submarket,
they
are
going
to
sacrifice
competition
in
the
philadelphia
market
and
i
submit
that
whatever
the
rule
of
reason
may
dictate
in
other
situations
that,
that
cannot
be
a
sufficient
business
justification
for
this
kind
of
a
merger
in
this
situation.
now,
mr.
price
has
argued
that
there
is
a
difference
between
banking
and
other
types
of
business.
he
has
said
that
the
difference
between
banking
and
other
types
of
business
is
the
significance
of
deposits,
now
precisely
we
concede
exactly
that.
it
is
perfectly
true
banks
don't
manufacture
their
raw
material
or
their
products
as
other
businesses
do,
they
are
dependent
on
deposits
and
that
is
the
--
but
what
mr.
price
or
mr.
littleton
failed
to
do
is
to
point
out
the
significance
of
this
fact.
the
significance
of
this
fact
is
that
when
you
combine
banks
controlling
36%
of
the
deposits
in
philadelphia,
you
have
eliminated
competition
from
36%
of
the
market
in
philadelphia,
because
it
is
the
deposits,
which
constitute
the
pool
from
which
the
loans
are
made.
this
isn't
a
matter
of
one
less
out
of
40
banks.
this
is
a
matter
of
the
credit
pool
from
which
loans
can't
be
made,
being
combined
in
two
massive
chunks
of
15
and
21%.
so
the
36%
of
it
constitutes
a
single
unified
control
and
there
isn't
any
question
that
they
do
in
fact
control
the
36%
of
the
deposits
in
philadelphia.
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
the
smaller
banks
are
going
to
have
their
credit
pool
exhausted
long
before
this
massive
bank
that
has
more
loans
than
all
the
35
small
banks
and
three
times
as
many,
as
i
recollect
the
35
small
banks,
but
together
each
one
of
these
banks
has
more
deposits
than
all
the
35
small
banks
put
together.
so
that
this
isn't
eliminating
one
bank,
this
is
the
equivalent
of
wiping
out
all
35
small
banks
in
philadelphia
as
active
competitors
in
the
loan
pool.
mr.
clark
or
justice
clark
or
justice
brennan,
i
believe
asked
for
the
report
of
a
federal
reserve
board
of
governors,
this
is
worthy
of
a
note.
this
is
what
the
federal
reserve
board
of
governors
said,
and
i
quote,
“the
proposed
consolidation
of
two
of
the
three
largest
banks
in
the
area
would
substantially
less
in
both
existing
and
potential
competition.
the
resulting
bank
would
obtain
dominant
position
with
pending
competitive
advantages
which
is
strongly
adverse
to
the
preservation
of
the
effective
competition,”
at
page
2834.
now,
it
has
been
said
that
we
called
no
witness
from
the
federal
reserve
board,
it's
perfectly
true.
no
witness
appeared
for
the
comptroller
either
and
it
is
significant,
the
federal
reserve
board
opinion
is
preceded
by
an
extensive
analysis
with
many
facts
with
careful
reasoning
that
leads
up
to
the
conclusion.
the
decision
of
the
comptroller
was
simply
as
far
as
we
can
ascertain
an
oral
decision
rendered
go
ahead
and
merge
boys
and
the
only
thing
--
the
comptroller
held
no
hearings,
the
comptroller
took
no
evidence
aside
from
what
was
submitted
to
him
by
the
advisory
agencies
and
the
banks,
the
comptroller
wrote
no
opinion,
the
comptroller
gave
no
reasons
for
his
opinion
and
the
only
thing
from
the
comptroller
that
appears
is
a
letter
of
approval
that
appears
at
page
3049
that's
dated
february
28th,
three
days
after
this
lawsuit
was
started,
because
it
refers
to
the
lawsuit.
so
that
if
any
weight
is
going
to
be
given
to
the
opinions
of
federal
regulatory
agencies,
i
respectively
submit
that
the
federal
reserve
board
opinion
on
its
face
is
entitled
of
vastly
more
weight
than
the
opinion
of
the
comptroller
and
that
the
conclusion
that
it
comes
to
is
indubitably
the
correct
conclusion.
and
faced
with
that
issue
of
whether
or
not
in
the
minute,
not
minute,
let
me
strike
that
from
the
record
--
that
in
the
national
market
for
multimillion
dollar
loans,
you
are
not
entitled
to
give
a
questionable
and
small
advantage
to
these
banks
at
the
expense
of
competition
in
the
whole
vast
philadelphia
market.
mr.
lee
loevinger
two
months
to
be
precise
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no,
sir.
i
said
that
his
approval
was
rendered
three
days
after
the
lawsuit
in
this
case
was
--
or
his
letter
of
approval
was
dated
three
days
after
we
filed
our
lawsuit.
our
lawsuit
was
filed
february
25th,
1961,
his
letter
was
dated
february
28th
it
appears
in
the
record
at
page
3049
and
refers
to
the
fact
of
the
pending
lawsuit.
mr.
lee
loevinger
it
should
be
looked
at
from
the
point
view
of
the
customers
and
of
the
competitive
bank
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
precisely,
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes,
sir
and
that
is
why
we
think
that
the
restraint
is
so
indubitably
clear.
mr.
littleton
has
argued
before
the
court
and
it's
clear
on
the
record
that
over
99%
of
the
customers
of
both
banks
are
borrowers
--
of
the
borrowers
are
under
$50,000
borrowers.
and
therefore,
by
the
clear
and
unequivocal
testimony
confined
to
the
philadelphia
market,
within
that
market
the
proposed,
by
their
own
statement,
the
proposed
merger
would
combine
36%
of
the
available
credit
pool
into
the
control
of
a
single
bank
and
would
deprive
the
customers
of
the
alternatives
presently
before
them
with
the
division
of
this
36%
between
at
least
two
banks.
so,
i
think
that
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
customers,
there
can't
be
any
question
that
there
is
a
significant
and
substantial
and
important
restraint
or
limitation
upon
competition.
mr.
lee
loevinger
the
next
largest
bank
would
be
about
50%,
against
smaller,
the
figures
as
i
gave
them
yesterday
and
as
i
recollect
them
your
honor
are
that
this
bank
would
have
assets
amounting
to
37%
of
all
the
bank
assets
in
philadelphia.
the
next
largest
bank
would
have
--
it
would
be
50%
larger
than
the
next
largest
bank,
three
times
as
large
as
the
third
bank
and
larger
than
all
the
remaining
banks
put
together.
mr.
lee
loevinger
these
are
technically
the
second
and
third
largest
bank,
but
at
the
present
time,
the
philadelphia
national
and
the
first
pennsylvania
company,
which
is
the
largest
are
very
close
and
in
some
respect
the
pennsylvania,
the
philadelphia
national
is
larger.
there
are
essentially
two
important
large
banks
in
philadelphia
that
are
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
this
one
would
be
50%
larger
than
the
second
bank,
three
times
as
large
as
the
third
bank
and
as
large
as
all
the
remaining
banks
combined
plus
some
left
over.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no
sir,
i
deny
that.
mr.
horne
president
of
the
broad
street
trust,
when
called
--
asked
whether
or
not
a
merger
of
a
bank
giving
it
a
larger
lending
limit
would
be
good,
he
said
as
a
matter
of
pride,
yes.
as
a
matter
of
competition,
i
don't
know.
that's
the
largest
philadelphia
banker
that
was
called
or
the
representative
of
the
largest
philadelphia
bank.
the
representative
of
other
banks
said,
it
would
increase
competition
and
what
they
clearly
meant
was
that
they
were
going
to
have
to
the
work
harder
to
maintain
their
position
in
the
face
of
the
advantages
held
by
the
merged
bank
and
several
of
them
made
this
perfectly
clear.
the
testimony
is
cited
in
our
replied
brief
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes,
i
believe
judge
clary
said
that
the
competition
would
be
increased
in
philadelphia
and
he
referred
to
this
kind
of
testimony.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no,
sir.
there
is
no
testimony
that
this
would
have
any
effect
on
rates
directly.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no,
sir,
i
disagree.
i
think
that
this
is
wholly
false
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
he
did
say
that
and
this
is
one
of
the
points
i
–
mr.
price
suggested
if
i
recollect
correctly
that
rates
are
controlled.
this
not
only
is
not
true
but
the
thing
that
we
are
seeking
to
do
here
to
preserve
competition
is
necessary
to
the
federal
system
of
regulation.
the
federal
reserve
board
does
not
undertake
directly
to
control
interest
rates.
interest
rates
are
not
set
by
the
federal
reserve
board
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
no,
sir.
there
are
varying
rates,
there
are
varying
service
charges,
there
are
differences
in
service
charges
and
in
rates
between
the
two
banks
involved
here
and
there
is
in
evidence
the
report
of
task
forces,
setup
by
these
two
banks
to
determine
what
the
rates
should
after
merger
and
the
court
found
and
it
is
the
fact
that
in
every
case
the
rate
adopted
was
the
one
more
favorable
to
the
bank
and
less
favorable
to
the
borrower,
but
with
respect
to
this
matter
of
the
regulation
of
rates
sir,
if
i
may
explain
our
view.
in
fact,
what
the
federal
reserve
board
does
is
set
the
so-called
rediscount
rate,
which
is
essentially
the
rate
at
which
the
banks
can
borrow.
now
it
is
indispensable
to
the
influence
upon
the
economy
of
this
rediscount
rate
that
the
rates
to
private
borrowers
should
flexible
enough,
so
that
they
follow
the
rediscount
rate
move
up
and
down
as
a
federal
reserve
board
establishes
the
rediscount
rate.
if
there
is
monopoly
or
restraintive
trade
or
other
inflexibility
in
the
banking
system,
then
the
banks
cannot
respond
in
moving
their
interest
rates
to
follow
the
rediscount
rates,
so
that
the
whole
scheme
of
federal
influence
upon
the
economy
falls.
and
there
is
no
direct
control
by
the
federal
reserve
board,
there
is
simply
an
indirect
influence
through
its
ability
to
set
the
rediscount
rates
and
if
we
permit
restraint,
if
we
permit
monopoly,
its
influence
is
reduced
and
eventually
to
nothing.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
the
merger
has
no
other
point
sir.
there
would
be
no
reason
for
a
merger,
if
it
didn't
give
it
a
competitive
advantage.
mr.
lee
loevinger
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
specific
testimony
on
that
sir
from
the
president
of
the
girard
bank,
who
got
up
and
testified
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
merger
was
that
they
were
spending
too
much
time
competing
with
each
other.
and
that
if
they
could
have
this
merger,
they
could
stop
wasting
their
energy
competing
with
each
other
and
go
out
into
the
national
and
the
international
field
and
spend
their
energies
there.
this
was
his
testimony
as
to
the
reason
for
the
merger.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
believe
that
when
you
talk
about
relevant
market,
this
is
a
conclusion
of
law
sir.
the
fact
that
it's
denominated
to
finding
a
fact
is
insignificant.
the
facts
are
perfectly
clear
and
in
fact,
the
lower
court
adopted
or
affirmed
numerous
of
the
findings
of
facts
proposed
by
both
sides.
among
those,
it
included
a
finding
proposed
by
the
defendants
that
the
relevant
market
was
not
philadelphia.
i
think
that
this
is
so
clearly
observed
that
it's
scarcely
deserves
a
very
serious
consideration,
because
the
fact
is
that
philadelphia
is
a
market
and
is
relevant
to
this
case.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
affects
of
this
merger
in
the
philadelphia
market
are
to
be
disregarded,
because
of
the
potential
advantage
in
the
national
market,
which
the
court
directed
its
attention
to.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
i
think
this
is
a
conclusion
of
law,
not
a
finding
of
fact
and
i
think
that
none
of
the
facts
that
are
specifically
found
as
such,
when
they
are
separated
out
from
the
conclusion
of
the
court
below
need
to
be
reversed.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no,
sir
because
again
these
are
conclusions.
the
court
and
the
findings
that
it
found
are
specifically
--
the
proposed
findings
are
all
key
to
testimony,
the
findings
are
key
to
testimony
of
the
kind
that
i've
referred
to,
a
team
of
bankers
who
said
the
merger
would
increase
competition
meaning,
we're
going
to
have
to
work
harder
if
this
merger
is
permitted.
the
president
of
i
think
it
was
one
of
the
--
i
have
forgotten
which
organization
said
“we
are
going
to
have
to
compete
harder,
because
the
merged
bank
will
have
more
offices
and
will
do
more
advertising
then
we
will
so
we're
going
to
have
to
work
harder.”
another
witness
said,
“the
competition
in
his
words
were;
will
get
worse”
and
what
he
meant
was
that
we
are
going
to
have
work
harder.
this
is
all
cited
in
our
reply
brief
sir,
set
out
there
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
what
is
meant
by
so-called
increased
competition.
what
is
meant
by
increased
competition
in
this
sentence
is
increased
competitive
pressure
on
the
other
philadelphia
banks.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir,
precisely
this
is
what
they
said
in
almost
those
words.
thank
you,
sir.
