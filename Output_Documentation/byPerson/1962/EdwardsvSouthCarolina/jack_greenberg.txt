mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
conviction
of
187
negro
students
in
columbia,
south
carolina
for
a
common
law
breach
of
the
peace
for
having
engaged
in
a
demonstration
at
and
around
the
columbia,
south
carolina
state
house.
and
here
behind
me
is
an
aerial
photograph
of
the
area
in
question
which
is
not
in
the
record,
but
which
counsel
for
respondent
have
agreed
with
us
would
be
helpful
for
the
court’s
understanding
of
what
happened
in
the
case,
and
i
may
refer
to
it
during
the
course
of
the
argument.
these
demonstrations
took
place
in
march
of
1960
at
the
time
of
the
various
sit-in
and
other
related
demonstrations
in
the
south
at
that
time.
and
it
would
be
useful
at
the
outset
to
read
the
definition
of
common
law
breach
of
the
peace
which
has
been
adopted
by
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina,
and
that
appears
in
its
opinion
on
page
200
of
the
record
--
its
opinion
in
turn
quotes
american
jurisprudence.
in
general
term
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
200
of
the
printed
record.
in
general
terms,
a
breach
of
the
peace
is
a
violation
of
public
order,
a
disturbance
of
the
public
tranquility
by
any
act
or
conduct
inciting
to
violence.
it
includes
any
violation
of
any
law
enacted
to
preserve
peace
and
good
order.
it
may
consist
of
an
act
of
violence
or
an
act
likely
to
produce
violence,
and
i
stress
in
that
reading
the
repeated
use
of
the
word
violence.
now,
the
warrant
under
which
the
petitioners
were
charged
appears
in
the
record
at
three
places
at
pages
2
and
3,
at
page
126,
and
at
page
183.
and
it
was
read
into
the
record
by
the
court
rather
than
having
been
copied
by
the
stenographer
and
there
are
some
slight
immaterial
variations
at
each
point.
however,
for
purposes
the
warrant
as
read
on
pages
2
and
3
are
adequate
and
it
concludes
commencing
at
the
last
three
words
on
page
2,
on
the
state
capital
ground,
on
adjacent
sidewalks
and
streets,
did
commit
a
breach
of
the
peace
and
that
they,
together
with
a
large
group
of
people,
had
assembled
and
impede
the
normal
traffic,
singing
and
parading
with
placards,
failed
to
disperse
upon
lawful
orders
of
police
officer,
all
of
which
tended
directly
to
immediate
violence
and
breach
of
the
peace
in
view
of
the
existing
condition.
mr.
jack
greenberg
on
page
126
and
on
page
183.
it
appears
in
its
fullest
form
on
183
but
the
language
--
on
126,
i
might
indicate
here
is
an
obvious
stenographic
error
and
that
the
word
violation
appears
instead
of
violence.
again,
i
stress
that
the
rule
of
law
under
which
petitioners
were
convicted,
contemplates
violence
and
the
warrants
with
which
they
were
charged
contemplate
violence.
now,
the
circuit
court
opinion,
that
is
the
intermediate
appellate
court
opinion,
also
suggests
that
there
was
violence,
but
not
so
strongly.
on
pages
193
and
194,
there
is
a
discussion
of
the
reason
why
the
conviction
should
be
upheld,
and
at
page
194
is
the
--
what
i
would
call
suggestion
of
violence
at
the
end
of
the
first
full
paragraph.
while
it
is
a
constitutional
right
to
assemble
in
a
hall
to
espouse
any
cause,
no
person
has
the
right
to
organize
demonstrations
which
any
ordinary
and
reasonable
thinking
citizen
know
or
reasonably
should
know
would
stir
up
passions
and
create
incidence
of
disorder.
and
so,
the
concept
of
violence
at
this
stage
of
the
litigation
is
now
being
watered
down.
and
when
we
reach
the
state
supreme
court
where
the
conviction
finally
is
affirmed,
there
is
no
mention
of
violence
whatsoever
in
the
affirmance,
which
we
--
a
pertinent
portion
of
which
we
may
find
on
page
201.
in
the
large
paragraph
on
that
page,
the
third
one
at
the
end,
the
state
supreme
court
opposed
the
convictions
below
on
these
terms.
the
orders
of
the
police
officers
under
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
were
reasonable
and
motivated
solely
by
a
proper
concern
for
the
preservation
of
order
and
prevention
of
further
interference
with
traffic
upon
the
public
streets
and
sidewalks.
the
appellants
not
only
refused
to
heed
and
obey
the
reasonable
orders
of
the
police,
but
engaged
in
a
15-minute
noisy
demonstration
in
defiance
of
such
orders.
and
so
the
conviction
which
originally
was
based
on
a
rule
of
law,
contemplating
violence
and
a
warrant
charging
violence
ultimately
is
upheld
on
the
basis
of
a
state
supreme
court
finding
of
interference
with
traffic
and
making
noise.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
correct
and
that's
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
quoted
in
our
brief
on
page
19,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
footnote
2,
it
is
set
forth
in
terms.
now,
subsequent
to
the
writing
of
our
brief,
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
has
decided
another
case
which
refers
to
and
further
characterizes
its
opinion
in
this,
the
edwards
case,
and
that
opinion
is
not
yet
reported,
and
that
is
the
city
of
sumter
versus
mcallister.
and
in
that
case,
it
reverses
a
conviction
for
breach
of
the
peace,
stating
that
in
the
mcallister
case,
unlike
the
edwards
case,
which
is
the
case
now
before
us,
there
were
neither
large
numbers
of
people
nor
interference
with
traffic.
and
so
its
characterization
of
edwards
in
the
mcallister
case
is
that
edwards
was
a
case
involving
large
numbers
of
people
and
interference
with
traffic,
again,
nothing
about
violence.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
is
no
citation.
it
was
decided
just
a
short
while
ago.
i
could
give
you
the
docket
number,
but
i
don't
have
it
at
the
moment.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
do
but
not
with
me.
should
i
submit
a
copy
to
the
court,
it
would
be
quite
simple
to
do
that?
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
it
will
be
there
tomorrow.
now,
our
argument
in
this
case
is
that
first
of
all,
that
on
this
record,
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
of
violence
or
insipient
violence
by
petitioners
or
by
anyone
else
that
is
neither
petitioners
nor
the
so-called
onlookers
who
presumably
were
in
opposition
group
were
violent
and
threaten
violence,
no
indication
of
violence
could've
occurred.
consequently,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
most
pertinent
one
would
be
taylor
versus
louisiana,
garner
versus
louisiana,
and
thompson
versus
the
city
of
louisville.
these
convictions
must
fall
as
being
based
upon
no
evidence
of
either
the
charge
made
or
in
this
case,
the
rule
of
law
under
which
the
charge
was
made.
secondly,
that
it
--
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
somehow
rather,
there
can
be
seen
a
situation
involving
actual
or
imminent
or
threatened
violence
and
it
would
be
violence
in
the
part
of
onlookers,
not
in
the
part
of
these
petitioners
who
admittedly
were
quite
peaceful
towards
everything
they
did,
and
we
deny
this
can
be
found
in
the
conduct
of
the
onlookers,
but
if
it
were
to
be
found
in
there,
it
was
the
duty
of
the
police
to
proceed
against
the
aggressors
or
the
would-be
aggressors
and
not
to
gratify
these
aggressors
by
proceeding
against
those
who
were
committing
no
violation
of
the
law.
and
in
fact,
there
is
a
south
carolina
statute
which
we
do
not
have
quoted
in
our
brief,
which
is
section
16-559
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
assault
someone
for
expressing
a
political
opinion.
and
so,
this
further
sharpens
the
notion
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
police
to
proceed
against
those
who
would
assault
the
petitioners
who
were
expressing
what
obviously
was
a
political
opinion,
and
that
moreover
decisions
of
this
court,
taylor
versus
louisiana,
aaron
v.
cooper,
little
rock
school
case,
buchanan
v.
warley,
all
stand
for
the
proposition
that
it
is
the
aggressors
who
must
be
put
down
and
not
those
who
were
engaged
constitutionally
protected
freedom.
moreover,
we
have
reference
in
our
argument
that
we
will
have
to
the
case
of
feiner
versus
new
york
upon
which
the
court
below
rested
its
opinion
and
upon
which
the
respondent
rests.
it's
our
position
that
the
feiner
case
is
quite
clearly
distinguishable
on
its
facts.
the
facts
in
the
feiner
case
and
the
issues
in
the
feiner
case
were
not
the
facts
and
issues
here.
however,
it
would
be
our
position
that
to
any
extent,
feiner
were
pertinent
here,
we
would
submit
that
it
was
the
dissenters
in
feiner
who
were
correct
and
who
have
been
vindicated
by
subsequent
law
especially
in
this
area
and
that
the
majority
opinion
no
longer
is
the
law.
and
finally,
it
is
our
contention
that
if
these
petitioners
could
be
punished
at
all,
they
should
not
have
been
punished
under
a
vague,
general,
common
law
concept
of
breach
of
the
peace,
and
by
this,
we
have
--
we
advert
to
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
cantwell
versus
connecticut,
and
mr.
justice
harlan's
concurring
opinion
in
the
garner
case,
but
that
they
should
have
been
punished
if
at
all,
they
could
have
been
punished
under
a
narrowly
drawn
precise
statute
directed
to
this
kind
of
conduct.
and
that
in
fact,
in
south
carolina
at
this
time,
there
were
a
number
of
statutes,
a
disorderly
conduct
statute,
a
statute
regulating
traffic
around
the
state
house
grounds,
an
ordinance
in
columbia
limiting
the
size
of
groups
that
might
parade
and
the
ordinance
in
columbia
directed
to
blocking
the
sidewalk.
and
that
all
these
statutes
and
ordinance
that
might
have
applied
to
the
situation,
but
instead
not
proceeding
on
any
of
them
which
express
state
policy
with
regard
to
this
type
of
conduct.
the
state
in
fact
proceeded
under
its
very
general
notion
of
breach
of
the
peace.
now
the
facts
of
the
case
were
the
190
negro
college
and
high
school
students
gathered
in
a
church
in
columbia
early
in
march
1960
with
the
purpose
of
protesting
racial
segregation
in
the
state
of
south
carolina.
they
proceeded
to
march
from
the
church
to
the
state
house
in
small
groups
of
about
15
to
18,
each
group
being
separated
from
the
other
by
one-third
to
one-half
of
a
block.
now
the
record,
i
think
is
complicated
but
becomes
immediately
simple
if
you
look
at
this
picture.
they
came
from
this
direction
down
gervais
street
and
when
they
reached
--
assembled
here,
some
of
them
entered
the
state
house
ground
at
this
point.
and
some
of
them
continued
down
gervais
street
and
entered
the
state
house
grounds
at
this
point,
which
is
also
known
as
the
“horseshoe.”
now
the
reason
for
numbers
was
that
the
numbers
were
a
function
of
the
expression
in
which
they
were
trying
to
engage.
their
point
was
and
this
appears
quite
clearly
in
the
record,
that
it
is
often
said
that
negroes
like
segregation
in
the
south,
that
they're
not
dissatisfied
with
it,
and
that
they
don't
want
to
do
anything
about
it.
and
they
may
very
deliberately
got
together
a
large
number
of
people
to
go
and
make
this
protest
so
as
to
make
the
point
that
there
was
general
dissatisfaction
with
these
conditions.
and
on
page
112
of
the
record,
one
of
the
demonstrators
testified,
“we
were
there
to
protest
in
order
that
they
might
see
for
themselves
that
the
--
we
were
in
number
and
that
we
did
not
and
we
still
do
not
go
along
with
the
principles
of
segregation.”
and
so,
this
was
not
a
type
of
protest
that
could
have
been
made
reasonably
in
any
other
way
other
than
the
way
in
which
it
was
made.
they
carried
with
them
signs
and
placards
such
as
down
with
segregation
and
things
of
that
nature.
they
entered
the
state
house
grounds,
at
the
two
points
that
i
indicated,
and
on
the
scene
were
a
number
of
police
officers,
the
number
of
which
is
not
clear
from
the
record,
the
police
officers
themselves
estimate
anywhere
from
15
to
40
city
police
officers,
a
number
of
the
most
commonly
given
number
is
about
30
however,
a
number
of
representatives
of
the
state
law
enforcement
division
and
two
deputy
sheriffs.
they
were
quiet
and
they
were
orderly
and
the
record
is
quite
clear
in
a
good
many
places
though
you
might
most
particularly
refer
to
page
88
when
the
chief
was
asked,
“did
any
of
your
men
make
a
report
that
any
of
these
persons
were
disorderly
in
walking
around
the
state
house
grounds?”
they
did
not.
under
normal
circumstances,
your
men
would
report
to
you
when
you're
at
the
scene.
they
should.
is
it
reasonable
to
assume
then
that
there
was
no
disorderly
conduct
on
the
part
of
these
persons
since
you
receive
no
report
from
your
officer?
i
would
take
that
for
granted,
yes.
now
there
is
some
testimony
that
they
were
singing
and
otherwise
vocal
when
they
first
entered
the
grounds.
however,
this
was
given
by
state
officers
who
upon
cross-examination
in
each
instance
retracted
this
testimony
and
it's
quite
clear
that
none
of
the
singing
occurred
until
after
they
were
given
an
order
to
leave.
after
they
entered
the
state
house
grounds,
they
proceeded
to
walk
around
the
state
house
quietly
bearing
signs
all
the
while,
in
fact,
all
during
the
time
in
question
in
these
small
groups.
while
they
were
doing
this,
traffic
to
some
extent
slowed
down
to
see
what
was
going
on
and
a
police
officer
was
dispatched
to
the
scene
to
move
the
traffic
along
more
expeditiously.
at
the
same
time,
people
coming
in
and
out
of
the
state
house
during
the
lunch
hour
were
to
some
extent
interfered
with,
however,
the
sidewalk
was
at
all
times
wide
enough
to
accommodate
more
than
two
persons
walking
abreast,
the
petitioners
were
never
more
than
two
abreast
and
there
was
no
real
difficulty
of
anyone
from
the
part
of
anyone
in
getting
involved.
and
pedestrians
were
freely
able
to
go
in
and
out
of
the
area.
however,
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
and
throughout
this
considerable
area,
i'm
informed
that
the
area
from
here
to
here
is
approximately
a
thousand
feet.
in
other
words,
the
blocks
are
500
feet
each.
now
at
this
time,
a
group
of
onlookers
began
to
gather.
approximately
150
people
in
the
horseshoe
area
here,
though
it's
not
clear
whether
that
also
includes
the
demonstrators
but
at
any
rate,
there
were
about
150
people
here.
and
the
estimates
of
the
number
of
onlookers
varies
all
the
way
from
200,
from
the
part
of
some
police
officers
up
to
350
which
is
the
outside
total,
most
of
them
however,
being
across
the
street
over
here,
the
onlookers
were
merely
curious.
no
one
uttered
any
threats.
there
was
no
violence.
there
was
no
effort
at
violence.
nobody
--
nobody
said
anything.
in
some
instances,
they
were
blocking
traffic
and
the
police
asked
them
to
move
on
and
when
the
police
asked
them
to
move
on,
they
did
move
on.
now
among
these
onlookers,
the
people
--
the
police
recognized
some
persons
whom
they
described
as
the
long-haired
boys
were
troublemakers.
this
was
a
very
ill-defined
term
and
no
particular
troublemaker
could
be
identified
and
no
particular
troublemaker
did
anything
and
no
particular
so-called
troublemaker,
i
should
say,
engaged
in
making
any
trouble.
when
the
troublemakers
were
asked
or
so-called
troublemakers
were
asked
to
move
on
and
leave
in
all
instances
they
did.
there
was
no
disobedience
on
their
part
at
all.
the
30
to
40
police
state
officers
and
sheriffs
were
in
the
testimony
of
the
police,
ample
to
handle
the
situation.
and
in
fact,
the
police
testified
that
if
they
had
not
been
ample,
they
could
have
easily
summoned
more.
i'd
like
to
briefly
refer
to
page
--
to
our
brief
here
where
we
set
forth
some
of
the
pertinent
testimony
which
is
however
in
many
places
repeated
throughout
the
record.
on
page
10
of
the
brief,
there
is
a
quotation,
the
chief
said,
“we
were
afraid
that
trouble
might
have
come.”
counsel:
i
see,
you
were
afraid
trouble
might
occur
from
what
source?”
chief:
you
can't
always
tell.
counsel:
but
if
you
regard
it
on
this
occasion,
it
was
sufficiently
apparent
to
require
you
to
arrest
them,
vertainly,
you
must
have
had
something
in
mind.
chief:
it
is
my
duty
to
try
to
avoid
trouble
if
i
can
as
a
police
officer.
counsel:
i
fully
appreciate
that,
i
certainly
do,
but
i
simply
ask
you
where
was
the
trouble?
chief:
actually,
any
trouble
hadn't
happened
but
if
you
can
prevent
trouble,
it's
your
duty
to
do
so.
counsel:
i
go
along
with
that,
are
you
able
to
assert
to
say
where
the
trouble
was?
chief:
i
don't
know.
then
the
city
manager
testified,
“i'm
afraid
that
curiosity
changes
and
brings
forth
possible
elements
which
would
create
difficulty.
counsel:
did
you
see
any
of
those
possible
elements?
“yes,
i
did
as
i
have
in
every
occasion
when
these
groups
have
demonstrated.”
“speaking
of
this
particular
occasion,
did
you
see
the
possible
elements
there
that
day?”
“yes.”
“who
were
those
persons?”
“i
can't
tell
you
who
they
were.
i
can
tell
you
they
were
present
in
the
group.
they
were
recognized
as
possible
troublemakers.”
“did
you
and
your
police
chief
do
anything
about
placing
those
people
under
arrest?”
“no,
we
had
no
occasion
to
place
them
under
arrest.”
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
now,
“sir,
you've
stated
they
were
possible
troublemakers
and
your
whole
testimony
has
been
that
as
a
city
manager,
a
supervisor
of
the
city
police,
your
object
is
to
preserve
the
peace
and
law
and
order.”
“that's
right.”
“yet,
you
took
no
official
action
against
people
who
were
present
and
possibly
might
have
done
some
harm
to
these
people.”
“we
took
no
official
action
because
there
was
none
to
be
taken.
they
were
not
creating
a
disturbance.
those
particular
people
were
not
at
that
time
doing
anything
to
make
trouble,
but
they
could
have
been.”
“did
you
order
them
off
the
state
house
grounds?”
“they
were
not
on
the
state
house
grounds
that
i've
observed
and
so
in
fact,
these
people
were
all
across
the
street
which
is
possibly
a
quarter
or
fifth
adjacent
to
the
block,
at
least
a
100
feet
away.”
“did
you
order
them
off
the
streets
adjacent?”
“they
were
on
public
sidewalks
and
we
made
them
clear
the
sidewalks
so
that
people
could
get
through.”
“you
don't
know
who
these
people
were
but
nevertheless,
you
recognized
them
as
troublemakers?”
“i
don't
know
them
by
name,
no,
but
the
minute
you
spotted
them,
you
knew
they
were
troublemakers.”
“i
knew
there
was
a
possibility
of
trouble
there.”
“yet,
you
took
no
official
action
against
them.”
“the
official
action
i
took
was
to
get
rid
of
the
cause
with
the
possible
difficulty.”
“but
you
just
said
that
the
negro
students
weren't
doing
anything
wrong,
that
is,
in
terms
of
misdemeanor.”
“they
were
not
obeying
lawful
orders
what
i
consider
lawful
orders
in
dispersing.
they
were
the
cause
of
the
group
gathering.
the
group,
the
so-called
troublemakers
would
never
have
appeared
had
it
not
been
for
the
demonstration
taking
place.”
and
so,
the
petitioners
were
then
told
to
leave
and
when
told
to
leave,
they
stood
there
and
sang
the
stars
spangled
banner
and
sang
some
hymn.
there
was
a
conflict
in
testimony
as
to
whether
they
engaged
in
the
singing
after
being
told
to
leave
or
after
their
order
of
arrest,
but
it
would
--
at
least
after
the
time
they
were
told
to
leave
that
they
engaged
in
the
singing.
as
to
the
audibility
of
the
singing,
the
best
that
the
record
indicates
is
that
a
police
officer
testified
that
he
guessed
it
was
audible
all
over
the
place.
they
were
found
guilty
of
common
law
breach
of
the
peace
and
were
sentenced
according
to
the
following
pattern.
all
of
those
over
21
years
of
age
received
$100
fine
or
30
days
in
jail.
those
between
the
ages
of
17
and
21
received
the
same
sentence
which
would
be
cut
in
half
upon
the
payment
of
$50.
and
those
under
17
received
a
$5
fine
or
10
days
in
jail.
now,
it
is
our
first
contention
which
can
be
referred
to
most
easily
after
a
recital
of
the
evidence
that
with
a
warrant
charging
violence
and
a
rule
of
law
requiring
a
showing
of
violence,
and
a
record
showing
that
there
was
nothing
but
a
peaceful
protest
to
the
state
legislature
which
i
neglected
to
mention
was
then
in
session
with
ample
police
on
the
scene
that
this
case
is
precisely
like
taylor
versus
louisiana.
in
fact,
the
onlookers
in
this
case
are
characterized
in
language
identical
to
the
language
in
the
opinion
in
taylor
which
said
that
at
the
trial,
there
was
testimony
that
immediately
upon
petitioners'
entry
into
the
waiting
room;
many
of
the
people
in
there
became
restless
which
we
don't
even
have
here,
and
that's
some
--
some
onlookers
climbed
on
to
seats
to
get
a
better
view.
nevertheless,
respondents
and
that
these
persons
moved
on
when
ordered
to
do
so
by
the
police.
there
was
no
evidence
of
violence.
the
record
shows
that
the
petitioners
were
quiet,
orderly
and
polite.
the
trial
court
said
--
who
held
it,
that
the
mere
presence
of
negroes
in
a
white
waiting
room
was
likely
to
give
rise
a
breach
of
the
peace.
and
we
submit
the
first
point
of
our
argument
that
these
two
cases
were
essentially
identical
in
this
respect
and
for
this
reason,
the
conviction
could
be
reversed.
but,
we
submit,
secondly,
even
if
in
this
situation,
somehow
there
could
be
seen
and
we
deny
that
it
rationally
can
be
found,
a
situation
of
incipient
violence,
then
the
police
should
have
gone
after
the
troublemakers.
if
they
had
any
reason
to
believe
that
these
people
were
violating
the
law,
were
committing
a
crime,
they
should
have
gone
after
them,
and
they
had
a
south
carolina
statute
which
i
referred
to
earlier
specifically
directed
against
those
they
would've
thought
persons
engaged
in
expression
of
political
opinion,
that
they
should
not
have
taken
action
to
gratify
the
aggressors
and
our
authority
for
that
is
as
i
stated
earlier,
little
rock
case,
cooper
versus
aaron,
buchanan
versus
warley
and
[inaudible].
we
come
to
feiner
versus
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
it
was
day.
it
was
around
noon,
around
noon,
yes
sir.
the
demonstration
ran
from
roughly
12:00
to
1:00,
something
like
that.
the
senate
was
sitting
at
this
time,
but
the
assembly
was
not,
and
that
was
the
part
of
the
purpose
i
would
imagine.
i
don't
think
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
they
went
there
--
that
they
were
sitting
at
that
time
but
their
purpose
was
to
direct
their
dissatisfaction
to
the
members
of
legislature
[inaudible].
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh
no,
no,
certainly
not.
in
fact,
everyone
admits
that
they
were
quite
--
they
were
quiet
and
orderly
as
they
went
around
these
grounds
and
presumably
would
have
been
if
they
hadn't
interfered
with
and
there's
no
evidence
that
the
singing
upon
they
were
ordered
to
leave
disturbed
anyone,
it
was
just
a
guess
that
was
audible
throughout
the
[inaudible].
now,
the
court
below
rest
on
feiner
versus
new
york
and
the
respondent's
brief
cites
only
three
cases,
one
of
which
is
feiner
versus
new
york
and
so
it
rests
on
this
entirely
on
feiner
versus
new
york.
and
we
say
first
of
all
that
this
case
is
completely
distinguishable
from
feiner
on
the
facts
that
this
case,
unlike
feiner,
does
not
involve
persons
who
incited
a
crowd
to
rise
up
in
arms
or
to
do
anything
violent.
these
people
did
nothing
of
this
sort.
they
merely
carried
signs,
quietly
expressing
dissatisfaction
with
racial
segregation.
there
was
no
showing
of
a
threat
to
the
police
or
the
speaker
in
this
case.
in
the
feiner
case,
there
was
a
threat
to
the
speaker.
someone
said,
if
you
don't
get
them
up
there,
i
will.
in
the
feiner
case,
there
were
two
policemen
and
78
or
80
people
out
in
the
street.
here,
there
were
30
to
40
policemen
and
the
police
officers
testified
that
this
was
ample
police
to
control
the
situation
that
everyone
was
obedient,
but
should
they
need
more
police,
they
could
get
more
police.
and
finally,
and
this
leads
me
into
the
next
point
of
my
argument,
the
feiner
case
did
not
discuss
the
issue
of
vagueness
when
it
impinges
upon
a
constitutionally
protected
right
such
as
freedom
of
speech.
feiner
involved
a
breach
of
the
peace
ordinance.
this
case
involves
usual
common
law
breach
of
the
peace.
and
we
submit
that
the
feiner
case,
so
far
as
--
as
that
is
concerned
is
not
authority
for
this
particular
case
because
it
did
not
fit
the
particular
point.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
no
there
is
none.
there
is
a
--
the
state
disorderly
conduct
statute
which
touches
upon
some
things
that
in
other
states
might
also
be
breach
of
the
peace
but
there
is
no
--
it
is
treated
entirely
by
the
common
law.
we
submit,
finally,
that
the
feiner
case,
that
the
dissent
in
the
feiner
case
was
correct
and
not
the
majority
if
the
matter
of
the
facts
being
different
and
everything
else,
if
we're
not
correct
so
far
as
that's
concerned.
now,
this
leads
us
into
the
last
portion
of
our
argument,
and
that
is
that
if
petitioners
could
have
been
punished
at
all
for
anything
and
we
don't
see
whether
they
could
have
been
punished
here,
certainly,
when
they
were
engaged
in
free
expression,
it
should
not
have
been
under
a
generalized
breach
of
the
peace
provision
which
exists
in
the
common
law.
now
we
think
in
this
respect,
cantwell
against
connecticut
governs
the
situation
completely.
cantwell
involved
common
law
breach
of
the
peace
as
it
applied
jehovah's
witnesses.
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
said,
we
think
that
in
the
absence
of
a
statute
narrowly
drawn
to
define
and
punish
specific
conduct
as
constituting
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
a
substantial
interest
of
the
state,
the
petitioners'
communication
considered
in
the
light
of
the
constitutional
guarantees
raise
no
such
clear
and
present
menace
to
public
peace
and
order
as
to
render
him
liable
to
conviction
of
the
common
law
offense
in
question.
and
this
essentially
is
what
mr.
justice
harlan
said
in
his
concurring
opinion,
in
garner
case,
i
would
submit,
when
he
said
that
when
a
state
seeks
to
subject
the
criminal
sanctions
conduct
which
--
except
for
a
demonstrated
paramount
state
interest,
would
be
within
the
range
of
freedom
of
expression
as
assured
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
it
cannot
do
so
by
means
of
a
general
and
all-inclusive
breach
of
the
peace
prohibition.
it
must
bring
the
activity
sought
to
be
proscribed
within
the
ambit
of
a
statute
or
clause
narrowly
drawn
to
define
and
punish
specific
conduct
as
constituting
a
clear
and
present
danger
with
substantial
interest
of
the
state.
now,
in
south
carolina
at
this
time,
there
were
at
least
five
pieces
of
legislation
that
could
have
dealt
with
this
situation.
there
is
first,
the
statute
that
appears
on
page
19
of
our
brief,
which
deals
with
impeding
traffic
in
and
around
the
state
house.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
statute
dealing
--
oh,
i
--
i
don't
know
but
it
--
i
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
it
was
--
i
don't
–
i
wouldn't
suggest
it
was
enacted
to
deal
with
this
type
of
situation.
i'm
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i'm
just
told
by
counsel
it's
a
very
old
statute.
secondly,
there
is
a
disorderly
conduct
statute
which
deals
with
making
loud
noises
in
public
places
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
16-558.
thirdly,
there
is
the
statute
which
deals
with
persons
who
would
assault
those
who
were
expressing
political
opinion.
in
other
words,
this
is
the
statute
which
expresses
a
state
policy
that
is
the
--
it
is
the
aggressor
and
not
the
speaker
who
should
be
dealt
with
by
the
police
and
that
is
16-559.
and
thirdly,
we
have
the
two
city
ordinances
of
the
city
of
columbia
which
are
not
set
forth
in
terms
in
the
brief
but
which
are
referred
to
by
the
chief
of
police
and
appear
on
the
record
at
page
44.
chief:
as
far
as
you
know,
is
there
any
ordinance
of
the
city
of
columbia
regarding
groups
walking
in
concert
in
the
public
speech
of
the
city
of
columbia?
answer:
with
a
group
over
15,
you
must
have
a
permit
and
he
also
says,
“we
have
an
ordinance
where
you
cannot
walk
the
sidewalks.”
so
there
are
two
other
ordinances.
there
were
five
pieces
of
legislation
which
may
have
dealt
with
the
situation.
south
carolina
proceeded
against
these
petitioners
which
are
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
they
are
merely
--
i
could
get
them,
but
they
are
merely
referred
to
by
the
chief
of
police
as
being
inexistent
and
i
understand
that
they
are.
mr.
jack
greenberg
they
are
certain
--
i'm
certain
they
could
that,
yes
sir.
now,
the
vice
of
this
kind
of
a
vague,
general
common
law
doctrine
when
dealing
with
speech
is
not
only
that
it
gives
unbridled
power
of
the
police
to
abuse
their
powers
under
the
cloak
of
such
a
general
authority.
but
it's
also
a
deterrent
to
speakers
because
--
whereas,
in
this
case,
these
speakers
were
quite
fortunate
to
be
able
to
employ
counsel
and
have
counsel
who
were
astute
enough
on
cross-examination
to
bring
out
all
the
facts
in
the
record.
as
you
notice,
all
these
facts
in
which
we
rely
were
brought
out
in
cross-examination
not
under
act.
most
people
can't
or
don't
employ
counsel.
these
cases
are
not
tried
and
people
generally
content
themselves
with
not
speaking.
and
this,
we
submit,
of
course
is
the
real
vice
of
a
prosecution
of
this
sort.
and
so
we
submit
that
for
the
various
reasons
given,
the
judgment
below
is
erroneous.
it
violates
petitioners'
constitutional
rights,
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
read
the
charge
in
this
record,
looking
at
it
on
page
2
and
3,
the
impeding
of
normal
traffic
and
singing
and
parading
with
placards
and
failing
to
disperse
upon
lawful
orders
of
the
police
are
presented
in
a
causal
connection
with
tending
directly
to
immediate
violence
and
breach
of
the
peace.
in
other
words,
these
are
not
set
forth
in
the
disjunctive
that
they
committed
a
crime
in
that
they
sang
and
paraded
(a),
failed
to
disperse
(b),
impeded
traffic
(c),
intended
to
lead
the
violence
(d)
these
first
three
things
are
suppose
to
have
led
to
the
violence,
and
i
think
any
plain
reading
of
the
charge
indicates
that.
and
so,
we
have
a
charge
as
well
as
a
common
law
rule
requiring
a
showing
of
violence.
and
we
have,
i
think,
now
a
concession
that
no
violence
or
anything
approximating
it
occurred.
but
even
if
these
were
to
be
read
under
disjunctive,
that
is
if
petitioners
could
be
found
guilty
of
impeding
traffic
in
the
moment,
i
hope
to
demonstrate
the
record
as
quite
clear
on
that.
we'd
like
to
refer
briefly
to
stromberg
against
california,
283
u.s.
at
page
368
at
which
a
very
analogous
situation
is
dealt
with.
i'd
like
to
read
just
a
couple
of
sentences.
the
verdict
against
the
appellant
was
a
general
one
as
here.
it
did
not
specify
the
ground
upon
which
it
rested.
as
there
were
three
purposes
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
the
jury
was
instructed
that
their
verdict
might
be
given
with
respect
to
anyone
of
them
independently
considered
it
is
impossible
to
say
under
which
clause
of
the
statute
the
conviction
was
obtained.
if
anyone
of
these
clauses
which
the
state
court
has
held
to
be
separable
was
invalid,
it
cannot
be
determined
upon
this
record
that
the
appellant
was
not
convicted
under
that
clause,
just
as
here,
it
cannot
be
contended
that
appellant
was
not
convicted
because
of
the
charge
of
violence
made
against
him
on
a
record
which
shows
that
absolutely
no
violence
occurred.
now,
there
have
been
some
references
to
the
record
and
the
one
--
one
reference
has
been
to
whether
or
not
the
sidewalks
were
clear.
and
a
good
many
places
in
the
record,
it
is
quite
clear
that
when
persons
were
obstructing
the
sidewalk
were
asked
to
move,
they
did
and
i
refer
to
pages
27,
41,
48,
and
92.
moreover,
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
no
car
at
any
point
made
any
effort
to
enter
the
state
house
and
i
refer
to
page
43.
there
has
been
some
discussion
of
the
number
of
persons
who
were
in
the
horseshoe
area.
there's
only
one
place
in
the
record
in
which
the
crowd
is
divided
up
into
numbers
as
to
how
many
were
in
the
horseshoe
area
and
how
many
were
outside
of
the
horseshoe
area
and
on
page
75
of
the
record,
it
is
said,
that
150
persons
were
in
the
horseshoe
area
and
that
would
mean
that
the
balance
were
across
the
street.
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
looks
like
a
horseshoe,
that's
the
area
right
here.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
that's
a
monument,
[inaudible]
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
it's
a
driveway
and
parking
area.
it
is
not
a
thoroughfare
and
the
record
is
quite
clear
on
that
that
it
is
not
a
thoroughfare,
it's
merely
a
parking
area.
and
that
record
is
quite
clear
and
it
appears
on
page
43
among
other
places
that
during
this
period
of
time,
no
automobile
made
any
effort
to
go
in
and
out
of
that
driveway.
moreover,
there
is
no
suggestion
as
to
again
getting
to
the
question
of
traffic,
impeding
traffic.
mr.
jack
greenberg
during
the
noon
hour,
during
the
lunch
hours,
between
12:00
and
1:00.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
--
yes
--
well,
i'm
glad
you
brought
that
out
because
they
all
circulated
around
and
then
they
would
stop
here
as
they
came
around
and
stopped
at
the
horseshoe
and
here
they
began
to
bunch
together.
mr.
jack
greenberg
by
the
police
officers
and
the
city
manager.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
they
were
[inaudible]
of
a
group
of
15
to
18,
the
half
of
the
third
[inaudible],
very
scattered
all
over
this
area,
but
as
they
came
around
it,
again
backing
up
at
this
point
where
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
but
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
disperse.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
they
would
have
been
for
a
moment
or
two
because
the
police,
i
gather,
waited
for
all
of
them
to
assemble
before
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
say
if
we
were
to
say
then
they
would've
dispersed.
the
police
did
not
order
them
to
assemble
but
the
police
stopped
them
as
they
got
all
the
way
around
there
until
they
began
backing
up.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
that
is.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that
is
the
conclusion
of
my
rebuttal
except
to
say
that
the
reference
to
these
other
statutes
and
ordinances
and
the
recharacterization
of
the
crime
if
it
has
been
recharacterized
and
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
points
up
even
more
forcefully
the
vice
of
inhibiting
speech
under
this
kind
of
general
common
law
breach
of
the
peace
doctrine
and
why
such
a
conviction
under
such
a
doctrine
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
don't
want
to
--
i
understood
the
attorney
general
to
say
that
there
was
no
violence.
now,
i
took
that
--
i
don't
know
--
i
would
leave
it
up
to
him
to
say
what
he
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no
actual
violence
and
i
did
not
understand
him
to
say
that
there
was
any
indication
of
any
violence
about
to
occur.
but
i
think
he
did
say
that
there
was
no
violence
and
that
there
was
no
breach
of
the
peace
up
until
the
time
they
began
singing.
i
don't
know
what
violence
describe
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
think
it
would,
imminent
violence.
mr.
jack
greenberg
imminent
violence
or
incitement
to
violence,
they
adopt
the
[inaudible]
definition.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
on
the
preceding
page,
however,
they
--
in
defining
breach
of
the
peace
on
three
or
four
occasion,
appears
to
have
an
ingredient
of
violence
in
the
definition
of
which
it's
not
alternative
there,
in
the
definition
on
the
previous
page.
on
the
next
page
however,
they
don't
refer
to
violence.
i
might
say
that
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
that
all
the
opinions
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
only
thing
that
could
possibly
refer
to
violence
is
this
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
preservation
of
order
and
prevention
of
further
interference
of
traffic
on
the
public
--
violence,
i
admit,
would
conceivably
be
read
into
that
but
i
would
imagine
it
could
be
said
more
clearly
than
that.
all
prior
opinions
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina,
four
of
which
appear
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
and
two
others
of
which
we
were
able
to
find,
mentioned
violence
in
one
way
or
another.
four
of
them
appear
on
page
200
of
the
record,
the
two
other
cases
we
found
were
state
v.
feiner
which
is
100
south
carolina
--
burns,
i'm
sorry,
100
south
carolina
230
and
then
the
state
v.
garlington,
56
south
carolina
413,
they
all
mentioned
violence.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
was
the
charge
and
we
submit
that
unless
there
was
some
evidence
of
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
don't
think
--
we
would
then
among
other
things
run
into
the
stromberg
situation,
but
we
don't
have
the
statute
here.
we
just
have
this
breach
of
the
peace
doctrine
which
apparently
develops
very
amorphously
or
--
and
that
maybe
very
well
but
we're
dealing
with
freedom
of
speech,
we
submit,
that's
something
that
can't
be
done.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
our
first
argument,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
right.
and
then
our
next
arguments
are,
of
course,
that
if
there
were
--
if
there
were
any
aggression,
it's
the
aggressors
who
should
have
been
arrested
and
not
these
petitioners
because
certainly,
none
of
the
violence
was
coming
from
them.
i
think
that's
quite
clear
if
there
were
any
violence
it
had
to
be
somebody
else.
and
then
our
final
argument
is
the
cantwell
argument,
cantwell
versus
connecticut.
i
might
--
one
of
my
associates
has
pointed
out
to
me
the
portion
in
the
record
which
answered
mr.
justice
clark's
question,
that's
on
page
86.
mr.
jack
greenberg
“you
were
present,
i
believe,
at
the
horseshoe
when
the
group
was
stopped,
the
individual
groups?”
“that's
right.”
“now
when
these
groups
were
stopped,
that
tends
to
make
the
second
group
move
closer
to
the
first
group.”
“it
did.”
“and
perhaps
lose
its
identity
as
a
separate
group
from
the
first
group,
is
that
correct?”
“that's
correct.”
and
that
shows
how
they
began
to
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
should
be
reversed.
