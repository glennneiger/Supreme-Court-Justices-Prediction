justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
attorney
general,
that
is
literally
the
way
it
read,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
general,
i
don't
quite
follow
that.
the
charge
is
that
all
of
these
things
tended
directly
to
immediate
violence.
now
as
i
understood
what
you
just
said
to
mr.
justice
white,
even
before
these
things
happened,
the
impeding
of
traffic
itself
would
constitute
a
breach
of
the
peace?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
how
would
that
--
what
i
don't
follow
is
how
does
that
tend
directly
to
immediate
violence?
