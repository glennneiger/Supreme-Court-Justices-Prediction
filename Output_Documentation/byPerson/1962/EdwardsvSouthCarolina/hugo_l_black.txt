what
i
mean
is,
your
argument,
is

was
never
a

and
that
does
not
appear
in

that

i
don't
quite
under

justice

l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
that
because
the
charge
did
say
that
they
impeded
the
normal
traffic;
that
was
one
of
the
charges.
justice

i
do
not
know
what
you've
said
about
your
general
statutes.
do
you
have
one
such
as
congress
passed
with
reference
to
this
court
that
it
should
be
unlawful
to
raise,
stand
or
move
in
sessions
or
assembly
within
the
supreme
court
buildings
or
grounds,
do
you
have
one
that
gets
decided
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
no
clause
to
make
it
illegal
to
have
a
parade
without
--
in
the
capital
grounds.
suppose
you
have
no
law
that
makes
it
illegal
to
get
off
the
sidewalk
in
the
dis
--
the
capital
grounds,
is
that
right,
or
to
come
in
without
permission?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
--
now,
i
think
that
ordinarily,
a
state
house
is
open
to
the
public
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
it's
not
problem
of
this

justice

black
both
with
reference
to
this
court
and
the
capital
by
making
it
illegal
to
parade
in
the
grounds
or
to
get
on
there
--
to
any
part
of
the
ground
except
sidewalks
and
the
driveways,
you
have
no
law
like
that
as
i
understand
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
--
they
have
not
been
convicted
on
a
charge
of
that
kind.
