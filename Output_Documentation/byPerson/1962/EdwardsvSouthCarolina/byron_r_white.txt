how
about
the
--
how
about
the
--
i
thought
the
point
that
was
made
--
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
to
support
the
charge
with
violence
[inaudible]
--
justice
byron
r.
white
which
--
what
is
true,
that
there
was
no
evidence
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
weren't
they
charged
with
violence?
justice
byron
r.
white
weren't
they
charged
with
violence?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
an
element
of
violence?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
remember
it
but
how
come
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
the
issue
[inaudible]
is
that
they
encouraged
violence,
it
was
taken
from
violence
under
the
proof
offered,
didn't
suppose
those
charges?
i
thought
that
was
their
very
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
do
you
say
that
don't
make
any
point
with
the
evidence
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
they
weren't
--
they
weren't
convicted
from
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
convicted
by
the
breach
of
the
peace,
not
by
impeding
the
traffic,
wasn't
it?

justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
the
time
--
at
the
time
they
were
ordered
to
leave,
were
the
groups
of
15
all
assembled
there
in
the
horseshoe
or
were
they
still
scattered
out
around?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
onlookers
were
also
close
at
hand
in
the
horseshoe?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you'd
say
both
the
onlookers
and
the
demonstrators
were
actually
moved
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
the
onlookers
move
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
onlookers?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
where
was
the
--
where
was
the
violence,
the
--
the
onlookers
[inaudible]
where
does
the
--
where
does
the
threat
of
violence
took
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you'd
think
the
breach
of
the
peace
--
that
kind
of
law,
breach
of
the
peace
in
your
state
that
can't
be
made
out
of
a
traffic
--
traffic
without
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
not
any
type
of
violence.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
even
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
--
even
if
impeding
traffic
along
with
the
breach
of
the
peace,
nevertheless
this
charge
--
didn't
charge
them
with
that.
this
charge
charged
them
with
only
--
it
was
this
conduct
which
led
to
violence.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
only
conduct
which
led
the
violence
that
you
apparently
say
now,
appeared
after
the
order
to
disperse.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
greenberg,
i
didn't
understand
--
i
didn't
hear
any
contention
[inaudible]
are
you
not
that
there
being
no
evidence
of
violence
or
any
type
of
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
actual
--
no
actual
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
do
i
understand
that
the
case
is
clear
upon
the
--
whether
or
not
the
state
was
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
then
--
even
if
the
statute
--
let's
assume
that
the
statute
was
[inaudible]
would
the
evidence
be
enough
to
sustain
the
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
--
the
fundamental
core
of
your
argument
i
gather
that
this
would
be
a
charge
of
violence
and
they
didn't
prove
violence
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
failure
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
as
mentioned
by
[inaudible],
was
it?
