mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
many
of
the
facts
in
the
record
before
the
court
in
this
--
these
cases
are
not
in
dispute.
some
emphasis
had
been
given
in
the
counsel's
argument
with
respect
to
some
facts,
some
facts
that
i
would
give
more
emphasis
to,
some
facts
i
think,
have
been
omitted
which
i
think
would
be
of
considerable
help
to
the
court
to
determine
these
cases.
it's
apparent
from
the
record
that
up
until
a
certain
point,
there
was
no
outward
manifestation
of
this
order
other
than
the
obstruction
of
sidewalks
and
traffic
lanes.
it's
apparent
from
the
record
in
its
entirety
that
there
was
no
overt
act
committed
by
any
onlooker.
and
it's
apparent
and
cleared
by
the
record
and
i
think
beyond
any
dispute
that
this
assemblage
was
permitted
to
demonstrate
for
30
to
45
minutes
and
by
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
defendants
himself
for
a
period
of
about
one
hour.
it's
clear
therefore
that
they
were
permitted
to
carry
on
their
demonstration
at
least
30
minutes
to
45
minutes
unmolested
at
all.
it's
clear
also
as
to
the
number
of
participants
in
this
demonstration
and
the
testimony
generally
is
in
agreement
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
processions
approached
the
state
house
and
how
they
acted
thereafter
although
there
are
some
immaterial
variances
about
that.
it's
clear
also
that
these
persons
were
permitted
by
persons
in
authority
to
enter
the
state
house
and
to
conduct
a
peaceable
demonstration
when
they
requested
permission
to
do
so.
but
beyond
that
point,
there
is
a
difference
of
interpretation
on
the
facts
between
myself
and
counsel.
when
the
groups
approached
the
state
house
from
assembly
street,
[inaudible]
rather
a
few
of
them
going
through
the
state
house
grounds
along
this
route,
some
i
believe
went
along
the
assembly
and
back
on
the
south
end
of
the
state
house.
the
major
group
[inaudible]
came
up
to
what
is
known
as
referred
to
here
as
the
horseshoe.
they
were
in
groups
generally
considered
to
be
between
15
and
30.
inside
the
grounds
of
the
state
house
after
they
had
secured
permission
or
been
granted
permission
to
go
into
the
state
house.
they
followed
[inaudible]
throughout
the
areas
where
they
paraded.
some
of
them
according
to
the
testimony
paraded
along
the
largest
streets
or
sidewalks
on
the
outer
limits
of
the
state
house
property,
some
on
the
smaller
walkways
in
here.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
if
your
honor
please,
it
is
generally
open.
the
record
discloses
that
on
one
occasion,
a
revivalist,
dr.
billy
graham
was
refused
permission
to
use
the
state
house
grounds
for
the
purposes
that
–
[inaudible]
line
formation
known
to
me
at
that
time
it
does
not
appear
on
the
record,
that
was
on
the
basis
of
the
church
state
relationship.
the
record
indicates
that
it
was
because
--
it
was
proposed
to
be
racially
integrated
meeting.
the
record
further
shows
that
the
ku
klux
klan
was
refused
permission
also
and
the
record
shows
that
it
was
not
refused
on
the
basis
that
the
ku
klux
rally
was
going
to
be
an
integrated
event
and
those
two
are
the
only
ones
that
appear
in
the
record.
there
is
a
statute
that
appears
in
the
respondent's
brief
relating
to
the
management
of
the
state
house
grounds
and
merely
has
the
effect
of
saying
it
in
its
unlawful
use
except
for
public
officials
and
persons
having
business
inside
the
state
house
--
in
the
state
house
and
the
general
regulation
of
the
grounds
is
in
the
discretion
of
an
agency
designated
in
the
statute,
a
state
agency.
it
is
used
to
my
knowledge,
the
record
doesn't
show.
i
think
the
court
should
take
judicial
notice
to
the
fact
that
they
used
for
appearances
such
as
mr.
eisenhower,
mr.
nixon
and
mr.
kennedy
and
[inaudible]
of
that
nature.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes,
it's
about
four
acres
in
a
--
four
acres
within
the
entire
area.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
right.
along
in
this
area
there's
a
small
railing
about
a
foot
high.
along
these
walkways
up
for
about
--
along
this
area,
and
perhaps
on
this
area
there
is
a
railing,
otherwise
there
are
--
railings
of
about
a
foot
in
height
but
they
are
not
blocked
off
in
actuality.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
the
normal
procedure.
the
statute
that
i
have
referenced
to
a
moment
ago
prescribes
it
nothing
in
the
limitations
with
respect
to
use
of
it
by
persons
having
business
in
the
state
house.
nothing
in
the
foregoing
shall
be
construed
to
abridge
authority,
the
budget
and
control
board
to
grant
permission
to
use
state
house
grounds
for
educational,
electrical
decorations
and
similar
purposes.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i'm
reading
from
section
1-412
executive,
cited
in
respondent's
brief,
on
the
latter
portion
of
it
that
--
page
10
in
respondent's
brief.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
at
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
the
record
shows
as
i
think
i'm
clear
that
the
demonstration
was
to
be
held
at
the
state
house
grounds.
as
counsel
stated,
i
think
they
brought
in
the
fact
that
the
legislature
was
in
session
at
that
time.
the
senate
was
the
only
body
in
session
at
that
time.
they
were
to
meet
at
the
state
house
grounds.
i
presumed
you
could
conclude
from
that
that
there
was
a
demonstration
to
take
place
on
the
state
house
grounds.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
there's
no
evidence
whatsoever.
i
think
it
can
be
fairly
concluded
that
the
idea
was
to
parade
around
and
about
the
state
house
grounds.
i
think
that's
the
object
of
it.
i
believe
that
is
what
--
the
record
shows
no
more
than
that.
there
was
no
attempt
that
in
the
speech
making
with
exception
of
one
impromptu
thing
that
i
will
refer
to
in
a
moment.
it
was
clear
that
the
parade
in
the
manner
that
i've
outlined
a
moment
ago,
but
it's
clear
moreover
that
--
and
the
times
up
fairly
well
fixed.
the
time
of
arrest,
it's
been
pointed
beyond
any
question,
at
1:15
in
the
afternoon.
and
it's
generally
agreed
that
these
proceedings
through
the
state
house
grounds
started
about
noontime.
therefore,
there
was
an
interval
of
about
one
hour
before
any
action
was
taken
by
anyone
in
authority.
now,
after
they
had
paraded
around
the
state
house
grounds,
around
the
streets
that
enclosed
the
entire
state
house
area,
for
a
period
of
approximately
35
--
30
to
45
minutes.
then
they
were
requested
to
disperse.
now,
at
that
time,
at
the
time
that
they
were
requested
to
disperse,
they
were
obstructing
--
obstruct
--
they
were
obstructing
the
sidewalks,
the
traffic
ways
and
the
passages
leading
into
the
state
house
grounds
and
in
this
area
known
as
the
horseshoe
area
which
i
would
estimate
could
be
approximately
60
feet
in
width.
that
obstruction
of
traffic
is
clearly
shown
by
the
testimony.
in
addition
to
that,
the
onlookers
were
not
concentrated
upon
that
point
--
in
the
area
immediate
--
across
gervais
street
from
the
ground.
the
onlookers
were
eventually
channeled
in
this
area
along
here
in
the
horseshoe.
the
onlookers
primarily
came
at
that
time
from
persons
who
were
getting
out
of
their
work
for
the
lunch
hour.
the
onlookers
also
came
from
office
buildings
across
the
street,
across
the
street
here
from
a
hotel
building
across
the
street.
this
is
the
part
of
u.s.
highway
1,
a
very
busy
intersection
particularly
at
that
time
of
day.
the
estimate
of
the
number
of
persons
who
were
attracted
to
this
demonstration
varied
i
think
from
about
200
up
to
one
witness
who
testified
400.
they
generally
testified,
i
believe,
the
majority
of
them
testified
that
about
200
to
300
persons
were
attracted
to
this
demonstration.
now,
i
state
a
moment
ago
that
there
was
obstruction
of
the
walkways
--
obstructions
of
the
streets.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
primarily
--
primarily
in
this
horseshoe
area.
this
is
a
monument
here
and
the
general
situs
of
what
took
place
was
just
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
this
monument
and
that
is
where
the
largest
crowd
of
onlookers
gathered.
the
conditions
at
this
time,
after
having
demonstrated
for
about
--
up
to
45
minutes
were
described
by
the
city
manager
who
was
there
in
charge
by
virtue
of
his
authority
as
city
manager.
and
in
response
to
this
question,
i'm
reading
from
the
record
on
page
11.
now,
with
relation
to
the
sidewalks
around
the
horseshoe
and
the
lane
for
vehicular
traffic,
how
was
the
crowd
distributed
with
regard
to
those
sidewalks
and
roadways.
well,
the
conditions
varied
from
time
to
time
but
in
numerous
times,
they
were
blocked
almost
completely
with
probably
as
many
as
30
or
40
persons
both
on
the
sidewalk
and
in
the
street
area.
further
along,
he
stated
it
was
extremely
difficult
for
a
pedestrian
wanting
to
get
through
to
get
through.
on
page
26,
he
testified,
the
people
that
i
saw
were
congregated
right
around
the
horseshoe
area.
many
backed
up
into
the
driveway,
into
the
horseshoe
area
across
the
sidewalk
on
the
lawns
adjacent
to
the
horseshoe
area
and
across
gervais
street
on
both
corners
of
maine
and
gervais.
the
chief
of
police
testified,
sidewalks
and
traffic
lanes,
i'm
interpolating
traffic
lanes,
were
right
crowded.
and
from
time
to
time,
we
had
to
ask
pedestrians
to
move
on.
further
along
he
said,
we
had
to
place
a
traffic
man
at
the
intersection
to
handle
traffic
and
pedestrians.
now,
the
counsel's
reference
a
moment
ago
to
the
testimony
of
the
police
chief
wherein
he
stated
that
sidewalks
were
not
blocked.
i
neglected
to
mention
that
his
explanation
immediately
after
saying
the
sidewalks
were
not
blocked,
i
want
to
state
that
in
the
state
house
grounds,
they
were
not
blocked.
i
had
reference
to
these
crossways
that
run
throughout
the
inner
portion
of
the
state
house
grounds
and
i
think
that
that
is
borne
out
by
the
testimony.
there's
no
question
except
from
one
witness,
lieutenant
shouter
of
the
constabulary
that
the
crossways
were
blocked.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes
it
is.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that
was
after
they
had
entered
the
state
house
grounds
and
they
entered
generally
here.
they
walked
around
and
about
the
state
house
grounds
and
there's
no
evidence
as
to
the
number
of
times
but
the
evidence
is
fairly
susceptible
in
the
fact
that
they
have
walked
around
and
about
the
state
house
grounds.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
--
that's
correct
with
the
exception
of
one
police
officer
who
testified
that
on
the
back
side
of
the
state
house,
this
area
here,
he
had
requested
that
they
go
single
file
rather
than
two
abreast
and
that
they
refused
to
do
so
and
that
there
was
consequently
crowding
of
those
sidewalks
in
that
area.
that's
the
only
evidence
with
respect
to
those
sidewalks
within
the
area.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that
--
no
vehicle
as
to
the
record
your
honor.
no
vehicle
attempted
to
get
in
or
get
out
but
the
testimony
is
susceptible
in
fact
that
none
could
have
but
none
did
in
fact
attempt
it.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
did
not,
that's
true.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
shown
by
the
testimony
of
the
city
manager
who
took
charge,
sir.
his
words
were
these
--
he
precipitated.
now
this
did
not
precipitate
there
is
a
very
significant
factor.
this
precipitated
his
order
for
the
group
to
disperse
and
the
order
for
dispersal
was
because
of
the
gathering
of
the
crowd,
because
of
the
fact
that
side
works
--
sidewalks
were
being
blocked,
because
there
was
always
in
a
group
like
that
a
chance
for
violence
and
rioting
to
occur
that
i
felt
that
the
students
must
be
dispersed.
further
on,
what
led
--
in
answer
to
the
question,
what
led
you
to
believe
there
might
be
a
riot?
the
size
of
the
crowd,
the
activities
of
the
students,
the
types
of
persons,
willing,
ready
and
able
and
eager
to
create
violence
whether
along
--
blocking
of
streets
and
sidewalks
was
a
factor
in
--
him
arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
these
--
that
the
matter
should
be
dispersed.
now,
that
is
as
--
as
i've
said,
a
significant
step
separate
from
what,
from
the
order
of
arrest.
and
i
can
state
in
all
frankness
to
the
court
here
that
at
the
time
that
order
of
dispersal
was
given
after
the
matter
has
gone
on
for
about
45
minutes,
at
the
time
that
order
of
dispersal
was
given,
there's
an
entirely
different
set
of
facts
that
this
court
would
have
faced,
had
an
arrest
been
made
at
that
time.
this
court
would,
as
i
see
it,
have
been
faced
only
with
the
fact
that
these
groups
of
students
were
parading
but
they
were
obstructing
traffic
lanes,
obstructing
sidewalks
on
public
property
on
the
state
house
capital
ground.
now,
after
that
dispersal
order
was
given
then
an
entirely
different
set
of
facts
is
presented
for
the
court's
consideration
and
that
is
what
led
to
the
arrest
of
these
students.
here,
as
evidenced,
as
i
see
it
as
to
what
took
place
after
the
order
of
dispersal
was
given,
and
they
said
in
effect
that
you've
demonstrated
long
enough
now,
you've
got
15
minutes
in
which
to
break
up.
they
talked
to
the
recognized
leader,
reverend
david
carter,
and
gave
him
that
information.
he
in
turn
went
to
the
various
groups
involved
and
in
the
words
of
i
think
each
witness,
harangued
those
groups
in
a
religious
type
approach,
i
believe
the
witnesses
described
it,
creating
a
fervor
among
them
and
then
after
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
only
the
word
harangue,
i
believe
is
as
much
as
i
recall
mr.
justice.
the
religious
type
--
word
in
--
i
think
appears
in
there
too,
religious
type
approach.
after
that
order,
mr.
mcnayr
testified,
“the
air
was
full
of
noises,
people
were
talking
and
jabbering
and
carrying
on.”
on
page
31,
“there
was
general
singing,
stomping
of
feet,
trifling,
singing
in
very
loud
voices.”
the
chief
of
police
testified,
singing
was
right
noisy
at
times
or
he
further
testified
that
they
were
hollering
in
very
large
voices.
lieutenant
shouter
testified
that
they
were
singing,
chatting
--
shouting.
lieutenant
shouter's
testimony
was
to
the
effect
that
that
type
of
activity
was
engaged
in
before
the
order
of
dispersal
was
given.
he
is
the
only
one
who
testified
to
that
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
and
he
was
in
the
back
of
the
state
house
apparently
by
himself.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
it
is
on
page
55.
at
approximately
55,
your
honor,
i
did
not
--
it's
about
page
55.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
the
star
spangled
banner
was
one
and
i
shall
not
be
moved
was
the
only
other
one
that
comes
to
my
mind
at
the
present
time.
i
think
those
were
the
only
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
shall
not
be
moved.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
a
hymn.
i
know
that
must
be
a
--
spiritual.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
those
were
the
only
two
that
i
believe
were
identified
in
the
testimony.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
haven't
seen
it.
from
what
i
have
seen,
i
have
observed
the
--
it's
different,
vastly
different
than
the
ones
that
i
recall
and
i
don't
think
i've
seen
those
before
around
the
white
house.
one
is,
it's
not
on
the
ground,
two,
there
is
no
comparison
between
the
numbers
involved.
there's
no
comparison
between
the
numbers
of
onlookers
involved.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
well
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
in
my
experience
but
i
don't
recall
one
or
two
instances
and
then
only
one
or
two
or
three
people
that
i
recall
were
involved
around
the
white
house.
mr.
mcnayr
again
testified,
there
was
singing,
shouting
atmosphere,
a
loud
singing
--
stomping.
as
counsel
stated
a
moment
ago,
he
testified
that
it
was
audible
throughout
the
entire
area
referring
to
the
state
house
grounds,
so
much
noise
and
shouting
that
he
couldn't
identify
the
songs.
they
sang
the
star
spangled
banner
in
a
loud
and
boisterous
manner,
not
in
a
respectful
manner,
shouting,
stomping
of
feet,
raising
their
hands.
another
police
officer
testified,
they
were
singing
loud,
hollering,
clapping
their
hands,
stomping
their
feet.
mr.
mcnayr
testified
that
the
students
began
answering
back
with
shouts.
they
became
boisterous.
they
stomp
their
feet.
they
sang
in
loud
voices.
that
is
where
from
the
time
the
order
of
dispersal
was
given,
that
is
were
it
ceased
being
a
peaceable
and
orderly
demonstration
if
it
was
at
that
time.
that
is
when
it
ceased
being
peaceable
and
became
unpeaceable
and
was
a
disorderly
demonstration.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that
was
because
of
the
order
i
presume.
it
doesn't
--
it
does
now
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
no.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
the
conduct
in
refusing
to
disperse
is
what
precipitates
to
bring
--
what
i
contend
constitutes
a
breach
of
the
peace.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
the
refusal
to
disperse
and
in
a
manner
in
which
that
refusal
was
expressed
and
i
want
to
allege
that
the
charge
with
the
singing,
parading
with
placards
and
refusal
to
disperse
when
ordered
to
by
the
police
officers.
that
i
think
clearly
comes
within
the
inclusion
of
the
charge
and
no
point
has
been
made
at
all
with
respect
to
that.
now,
with
respect
to
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
with
respect
to
--
there's
no
--
no
point
has
been
made
so
far
by
counsel
for
appellants
that
the
proof
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
charges
as
laid
in
the
arrest
warrant.
no
contentions
have
been
made
in
that
respect.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
true,
that's
true
mr.
justice.
but
the
point
that
i
made
a
moment
ago
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
true
that
they
made
that
contention.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
but
the
point
that
you
ask
me
to
repeat
a
moment
ago
as
i
recall
it
was
that
i
had
just
stated
that
no
contentions
has
been
made
by
the
appellants
at
any
stage
of
this
prosecution
that
the
proof
was
not
responsive
to
the
charges.
and
that
is
the
two
cases
we've
cited
in
cole
against
alabama
and
the
other
one
are
on
that
particular
point
just
on
a
general
elementary
principle
that
you
cannot
convict
a
person
of
something
with
which
he's
not
charged.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
the
point
i
had
in
mind
in
making
that
statement
a
moment
ago.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
sir?
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
they
were
charged
with
the
breach
of
the
peace
which
is
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
violence
has
another
--
its
incitement
to
violence.
the
standard
definition
of
breach
of
the
peace
in
which
as
i
understand
was
reaffirmed
in
campbell
here,
is
the
definition
of
breach
of
the
peace
that
is
adopted
by
the
state
of
south
carolina.
and
it
was
correctly
read
a
moment
ago.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
incitement
arrived
at
which
to
serve
--
disturbs
the
public
peace
and
tranquility
or
may
lead
to
violence.
that's
effectively
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
they
do
contend
that
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
they
have
not
heretofore
made
any
point
except
the
fact
that
the
proof
was
not
sufficient
to
convict
them.
the
point
that
i
was
making
was
in
--
brought
about
by
--
with
this
in
mind,
cole
against
alabama
where
the
conviction
was
had
upon
a
charge
other
than
that
with
which
the
defendants
are
--
they
were
convicted
of
an
offense,
other
than
that
with
which
they
were
charged.
and
that
was
the
point
that
i
had
in
mind
stating
what
i
stated
a
--
i
said
a
moment
ago
that
they
--
as
i
know
of
--
and
i
think
just
as
mr.
justice
black's
question
precipitated
my
line
of
thought
on
that
that
the
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
right,
that's
right;
impeding
of
traffic
those
--
to
the
commission
of
the
offense
being
argued.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
it
is
not
printed
except
in
the
testimony
at
pages
that
the
counsel
referred
into
a
moment
ago
and
i
do
not
have
precisely
the
points
in
which
they
were
set
forth
on
page
2
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
--
in
general
terms.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
oh
yes,
oh
yes.
each
of
the
defendants
were
--
had
the
warrant
read
to
them
and
as
i
recall,
as
the
record
doesn't
show,
they
just
stayed
in
jail
overnight.
they
were
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
there
was
a
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
it
does
not
except
by
the
reading
of
the
warrant
by
the
--
by
the
magistrate.
i
should
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
proceeding
took
place
in
the
court
of
magistrate
justice
of
the
peace
limited
jurisdiction,
$100
and
30
days
appointed
by
the
government
and
that
the
record
--
in
the
record
of
the
lower
court,
it
appears.
it
does
not
appear
in
this
record
except
by
where
the
magistrate
read
it
into
the
record
or
stated
the
effect
of
it.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
believe
that
was
the
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
they
had
assembled
--
yes
sir.
they
assembled,
impede
the
normal
traffic,
singing,
parading
with
placards
and
failed
to
disperse
upon
lawful
orders
of
police
officers.
that
is
a
reading
of
it
by
the
magistrate
and
that's
a
matter
in
which
the
charge
appears
here.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
true.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
true.
that's
exactly
true.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
exactly.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
exactly.
and
that
was
--
and
significant
to
the
point
that
i
made
a
moment
ago
but
there
was
a
significant
interval
of
time
with
respect
to
the
order
of
dispersal.
i
make
that
with
this
reservation.
i
do
not
concede
that
there
was
no
breach
of
peace
--
breach
of
the
peace
prior
to
the
time
this
order
of
dispersal
was
given,
but
if
there's
any
doubt
about
it,
whatsoever
it
was
--
this
is
certainly
removed
by
the
actions
that
took
place
after
the
order
of
dispersal
was
given.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
obstructing
traffic
ways
and
passageways
of
vehicles
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
depriving
(inaudible)
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
depriving
the
public
of
the
use
of
the
--
in
these
circumstances.
now
at
that
time,
there
were
these
onlookers
of
250
and
300
people
in
that
background.
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
the
onlookers?
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
no,
not
completely.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
no.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
no,
the
record
doesn't
that,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
no.
there
is
testimony
that
the
onlookers
and
the
demonstrators
blocked
it
and
that
both
of
them
were
asked
to
move.
there's
this
--
testimony
that
were
complaints
from
passersby
complaining
of
the
fact
that
it
was
blocked,
that
the
passageways
were
blocked.
but
there's
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
blocking
of
the
sidewalk
took
place
not
only
by
the
persons
who
were
attracted
to
the
scene
or
happened
to
be
there
but
by
the
demonstrators
themselves.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
they
were
not
scattered
as
much.
i
think
the
testimony
is
susceptible
of
the
inference
that
they've
gathered
together
and
congregated
in
the
horseshoe
area.
there
may
have
been
some
that
were
about,
but
generally,
there
was
a
tendency
and
the
majority
of
them,
i
think,
were
congregated
in
the
horseshoe
area.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes,
sir.
there's
no
evidence
that
anybody
refused
to
move
along
when
they
were
told
to.
they
all
moved
along.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes,
sir
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
both.
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
there
wasn't
any
at
that
time.
there
was
not
any.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that
was
a
disorderly
conduct,
that's
impeding
of
traffic
ways
that
are
normally
reserved
for
the
use
of
the
public.
the
public
was
deprived
of
the
use
of
those
and
under
the
definition
of
breach
of
the
peace;
that
would
be
the
only
basis
on
which
finding
at
that
time
could
have
been
made
that
the
peace
had
been
breached.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
in
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
in
that
degree;
in
that
degree
and
under
those
conditions,
i
do.
now,
i
don't
want
to
emphasize
that
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that
would
have
been
the
only
basis
for
the
charge.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
don't
think
it
would
except
under
the
conditions
that
were
existing
at
that
time.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
now
that
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
right.
that's
true.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
true,
that's
true.
well,
that's
true.
i
could
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
--
face
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
true.
i
think
that
the
impeding
of
traffic
under
the
circumstances
here,
and
i
may
have
stated
or
answered
improperly
or
in
contradiction
of
what
i
am
saying
now.
under
the
circumstances
here,
the
impeding
of
traffic
with
the
crowd
that
was
gathered
there,
with
the
attention
and
so
forth,
officers
testified
--
with
the
persons
that
the
officers
testified
with
that.
now,
under
those
conditions
there
was
enough
to
lay
a
charge
of
breach
of
the
peace
here.
and
if
that
included
incitement
on
the
potential
bring
about
of
violence
then
that
would
be
sufficient
to
make
the
charge.
but
that
again
urge
--
i
again
urge
that
the
fact,
a
different
set
of
circumstances
that
occurred
subsequent
to
the
time
the
dispersal
was
given
and
that
is
what
led
to
the
arrest.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
municipal
ordinance
and
the
state
statute,
i
presume,
would
control
with
respect
to
this
area
in
this
thoroughfare
here
and
by
a
statute
it
may
have
been
enacted
subsequently
to
these
occurrences
which
i
have
in
1961
rather
than
1960,
as
was
stated
a
moment
ago.
the
statute,
i
think,
would
specifically
govern
it,
and
that
is
in
full
is
a
traffic
statute,
making
traffic
statutes
applicable
to
public
areas
around
the
state
house
enacted
for
the
parking
problem
rather
than
anything
else.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
am
sorry.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
think
it
was.
it
has
no
effect
whatsoever
on
because
it
appear
as
a
traffic
statute
and
does
not
--
and
i'm
fairly
certain
it
was
enacted
after
this.
the
statute
that
was
referred
to
here
was
not
enacted
after
these
events
took
place
however.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
do
not
other
than
what
i
read
a
moment
ago,
we
do
not.
i
did
read
one
a
moment
ago
that
[inaudible]
--
it
merely
makes
it
unlawful
to
use
the
state
house
grounds
except
for
those
persons
who
have
business
in
the
state
house
and
for
state
officers
and
employees.
it's
unlawful
for
any
person
except
state
officers
and
employees
and
persons
having
lawful
business
in
the
buildings
to
use
any
of
the
driveways,
alleys
or
parking
spaces
on
the
state
house
grounds.
it's
not
analogous
to
the
federal
statute
that
prohibits
harangues
and
orations
on
the
state
--
on
the
federal
capital
for
instance.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
sir?
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
they
were
in
the
streets
also,
in
the
traffic
lanes,
on
either
side
of
the
areas
surrounding
the
horseshoe
[inaudible]
just
about
space
for
another
vehicle
to
move
through
there.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
there's
no
evidence
as
to
the
number
of
vehicles
that
where
in
there
at
the
time
this
demonstration
took
place.
the
evidence
is
--
of
these
traffic
lanes,
the
inside,
the
area
there,
set
aside
for
vehicle
use,
were
obstructed.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
sir?
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that
is
a
driveway.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
don't
know
whether
this
acts
--
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know.
breach
of
the
peace,
i
think
was
more
fitting
for
that,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
charge
was
made
not
only
in
connection
with
the
traffic
ways
there
but
on
the
sidewalks
and
other
places
too.
and
the
charge
there
--
comes
out
of
stamping
your
feet,
singing,
clapping
hands,
shouting
in
loud
voices
and
things
of
that
nature.
that
could've
taken
place
on
the
sidewalk,
could've
taken
place
in
the
traffic
areas,
i
think
it
probably
took
place
in
both
of
them.
that's
the
fact
that
gave
rise
to
this
charge
being
made
and
i
assume
that
the
charge
was
referring
to
--
or
the
mere
fact
that
other
charges
could've
been
brought
and
shouldn't
militate
against
the
fact
that
this
charge
is
a
common
law
hence
recognized
in
this
state,
recognized
so
far
as
i'm
aware
throughout
the
entire
united
states.
and
i'm
sure
that
it
couldn't
be
contended
that
any
of
these
statutory
offenses
that
they
referred
to
here,
abrogate
the
common
law
offence
--
of
breach
of
the
peace
in
south
carolina.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
think
--
i
think
that's
the
reason
i
took
the
position
i
did
a
moment
ago
that
the
supreme
court
has
construed
it
that
way.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
think
so
--
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
don't
think
they've
ruled
out
violence.
i
think
that
they've
said
that
violence
maybe
or
incitement
to
violence.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that
may
be
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that
may
be
correct.
as
i
read
it,
i
see
that
--
i
feel
that
they
have
construed
obstruction
of
traffic
in
the
proper
circumstances
to
relate
to
violence.
now
whether
that's
right
or
wrong,
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
it.
that
is
a
construction
given
by
my
supreme
court.
that
is
the
position
i
take
here.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
[inaudible]
--
in
connection
with
that,
i
might
say
with
respect
to
this
taylor
case,
that
was
a
the
sit-in
demonstrations,
we
had
perhaps
10
or
12
decided
by
the
supreme
court
for
the
last
two
years,
numerous
cases
came
up
during
1960.
the
decision
of
this
court
entailed
was
followed
precisely
by
the
city
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
where
they
said
no
evidence
of
a
breach
of
the
peace
had
occurred
down
there.
merely
because
some
people
were
sitting
on
a
place,
customarily
used
by
white
persons
only
and
there
was
no
unusual
action,
resulted
in
violence
or
both
or
anything
of
that
nature
that
this
must
be
charged.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that
plus
the
fact
that
they
adopt
statutory
definition
of
[inaudible]
public
order.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
think
it's
the
same
thing.
in
the
feiner
case,
i
differ
with
the
conclusions
that
has
been
expressed
by
that
--
in
that
case,
75
or
80
people
makes
the
ratio,
they
filled
the
sidewalks,
spread
into
the
street,
loudspeaker
was
used,
some
pedestrians
supposed
to
use
the
sidewalk.
the
crowd
grew
restless,
some
pushing,
some
shoving,
some
milling
around,
that's
almost
precisely
a
recital
of
the
evidence
in
this
case.
the
only
difference
that
in
feiner,
you
had
one
person
to
make
some
obscene
or
profane
remarks,
you
do
not
have
that
here.
that's
the
only
difference.
as
i
read
the
court's
opinion,
they
–
[inaudible]
in
emphasis
to
the
fact
that
the
speaker
had
talked
for
an
hour
or
half
an
hour
in
that
--
in
that
case.
and,
i
submit,
that
this
case
comes
clearly
within
the
scope
and
the
ambit
of
the
feiner
decision.
and
i
read
also
cantwell
as
reaffirming
the
common
law
statutory
definition
of
breach
of
the
peace
and
on
page
308
of
that
decision
i
believe,
it
is
set
out
almost
verbatim
the
same
definition
of
breach
of
the
peace
that
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
set
out
in
this
case.
the
clear
and
present
danger
was
recognized
or
referred
to
in
cantwell.
that
had
already
occurred
by
the
time
the
arrest
took
place
in
this
--
in
these
cases.
the
fact
of
a
disturbance,
the
fact
of
breach
of
the
peace
consisting
of
singing,
shouting,
clapping
hands,
stomping
feet,
matters
of
that
nature
had
already
occurred
leading
to
the
arrest.
and
we
submit
that
the
evidence
clearly
requires
that
these
convictions
be
affirmed.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
no.
i
believe
you
--
my
--
this
statute
has
never
been
construed.
i
assume
--
i
think
the
statute
means
that
is
unlawful
for
anyone
to
use
the
area
ways,
the
alley
ways
on
the
state
house
grounds
wherein
except
vehicular
use
and
only
by
those
persons
having
business
in
the
state
house
building,
only
by
those
employed
in
the
state
house
building.
now,
i
say
that
because
prior
to
that
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
--
there
was
a
statute.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that
is
true.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
there's
nothing
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
none
except
this
--
nothing
in
this
act
should
be
construed
to
breach
of
authority
in
the
agency
in
the
state
name
there
to
grant
permission
to
use
the
grounds
for
educational,
electrical
decorations
and
similar
postages.
so
i
would
assume
from
that
that
permission
for
anything
relating
to
educational
and
electrical
decorations
and
similar
purposes
must
be
obtained
from
the
budget
and
control
board.
there
is
no
other
authority
for
the
granting
of
permits
for
any
other
use.
i
would
say
that
it
would
have
to
come
under
the
budget
and
control
board
and
get
permission
in
order
to
demonstrate
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
they
are
not.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
would
--
well,
i
do
know
and
groups
customarily
come
in
there
for
that
purpose
in
large
numbers,
textile
operators
for
instance
have
been
there
to
my
knowledge,
not
in
the
manner
in
which
these
demonstrators
in
these
cases
were
involved
but
nevertheless
with
the
same
exercise
of
the
same
fundamental
right.
it's
customarily
used
for
that
purpose
and
that
to
my
mind,
there
is
one
indication
that
there's
no
set
pattern
customarily
followed
with
respect
to
secure
information,
but
in
some
instances,
permission
has
been
sought,
permission
has
been
granted.
in
other
instances,
permission
has
been
sought
and
denied.
