i
noticed
in
your
brief
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
citation
of
that
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
you
say
common
law
breach
of
the
peace
as
you
referred
it,
there's
no
statute
[inaudible]
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
reference
to
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
any
citations
to
those
city
ordinances?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
wonder
if
these
were
applied
under
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
general,
what
you
said
of
its
--
his
argument
that
as
this
statute
ended
up
in
the
construction
by
the
supreme
--
by
your
supreme
court,
the
element
of
violence
was
omitted
as
an
ingredient
even
though
in
terms
of
its
common
law
definition
that
element
had
been
included.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
has
construed
it
as
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
as
not
requiring
violence.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
say
about
the
last
paragraph
of
the
supreme
court's
opinion
which
is
the
essence
it
seems
to
me
of
what
they
ended
up
in
finding
here?
the
paragraph
beginning
the
parade
was
conducted
upon
the
state
house
grounds
etcetera.
i
don't
find
any
reference
in
that
paragraph
to
violence
or
a
tendency
to
incite
violence
but
that
the
essence
of
the
offense
as
construed
by
your
court
as
the
common
law
offense
was
applied
here
is
the
defiance
under
these
circumstances
of
the
order
to
disperse.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
fair?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
the
construction
that
binds
us
or
you
have
to
start
from
--
that's
a
construction
that
binds
us
of
your
state
of
the
breach
of
the
peace.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
time
of
the
day
was
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
that's
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
that's
so
--
do
you
think
that's
so
clear?
justice
john
m.
harlan
preservation
of
order.
