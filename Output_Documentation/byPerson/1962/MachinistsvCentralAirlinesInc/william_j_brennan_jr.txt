justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
a
provision
for
judicial
review
that
is
on
the
part
of
these
employees
or
union
in
a
rail
system
board
like
from
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
the
problem
here,
isn't
it
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
not
assisted
by
express
exclusion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
didn't
fully
understand
what
you
said
earlier.
i
thought
you
said
that
there'd
been
at
least
three
rail
system
board
cases
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
got
into
the
federal
courts
and
no
one
questioned
that
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court.
did
you
say
that
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
this
be
true
if
the
lower
court
is
right
in
this
case,
this
also
would
have
to
follow
as
the
rail
system
board
review?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
morris,
am
i
--
what
you
have
to
do,
i
gather,
is
to
convince
us
that
there's
some
kind
of
federal
right
here
which
arises
under
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
limit
this,
in
other
words,
for
1331
purposes
in
article
330
this
jurisdiction
only
that
you
have
some
--
you
are
asserting
some
kind
of
right
which
arises
under
federal
law,
am
i
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
it's
contract
right,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
the
184.
is
that
what
you're
relying
on?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
--
what
--
if
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
this
so
i
understand
you
--
your
argument.
you're
then
going
to
try
to
persuade
us
that
a
right,
there
is
a
right
created
by
184
by
statute,
therefore,
that
you
do
assert
a
claim
in
your
complaint
which
arises
under
federal
law
for
the
purposes
of
1331,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
my
brother
white
just
suggested
to
me,
you
want
us
to
do
a
lincoln
mills
job
on
204.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
grounded
the
deciding
fact
of
what
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
morris,
is
that
generally
or
most
of
the
statutes
[inaudible]
before
or
is
independently
fashioned.
we
have
to
find
some
federal
substantive
law
of
contracts
at
least
as
regards
the
interpretation
and
scope
of
the
authority
of
these
agencies
board,
agency
board
--
system
board
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
finality
or
otherwise,
don't
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
let's
see
mr.
--
is
this
different
argument
from
your
department?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
have
noticed
you're
--
you're
appealing
the
1337,
that's
the
one
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
that
seems
to
me
under
both.
you
still
have
the
arising
under
questions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
problem,
although
you're
quite
right,
the
federal
law
governs,
that
this
would
only
mean
that
the
federal
courts
don't
have
jurisdictions,
the
federal
law
has
to
be
applied
to
state
court
to
prove
any
access
to
it
if
i
believe
so,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
be
satisfied
with
the
kind
of
access
you
get
from
the
--
in
a
federal
district
court
under
the
railroad
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
asking
for
something,
as
i
recall
it,
am
i
right,
that
when
you
go
from
the
national
board,
you
get
except
in
cases
of
money
award,
you
get
a
railroad
at
least
that's
de
novo
review,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
railroad
gets
another
crack
at
what
has
decided
but
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
on
the
money.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whatever
it
may
mean,
whatever
it
may
mean,
you're
suggesting
that
at
least
if
you're
entitled
to
be
in
a
federal
court,
you
get
something
different
in
a
way
of
a
review
or
a
right
to
enforce
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
something
more
than
the
--
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
be
a
better
review.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
mr.
dunau
are
you
arguing
that
perhaps
the
major
premise
was
that
of
course
there
was
enforceability,
giving
finality
to
the
adjustment
system,
adjustment
board
award
and
that
the
special
provision
for
the
rail
national
adjustment
board
review
is
a
limitation
upon
the
federal
jurisdiction
to
give
a
complete
enforcement
to
final
award
of
system
board.
in
other
words,
why
don't
you
use
the
special
provision
for
review
for
these
limitations
of
the
national
adjustment
board
award
in
your
favor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
suggesting
it
to
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
aren't
as
many
of
them.
