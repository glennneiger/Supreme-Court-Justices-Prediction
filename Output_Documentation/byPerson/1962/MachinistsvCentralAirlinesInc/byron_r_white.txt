justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
in
the
railroad
cases
or
that
the
system
board
decision,
does
or
does
that
the
federal
court
have
jurisdiction
to
enforce
that
award?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
you
would
but
for
the
same
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no
different
reasons.
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
that
reason
at
all
you
had
no
more
support
for
the
federal
court
having
jurisdiction
of
the
railroad
system
board
and
decisions
than
the
airline.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
no
--
there
are
no
cases
on
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
between
the
railroad
or
the
airline?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
the
other
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
the
following
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
contrary
to
national
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
here
now
if
you
--
if
the
act
had
specifically
granted
jurisdiction
to
this
court,
would
you
be
arguing
for
federal
law?
would
you
care
which
law
is
applied,
whether
it
is
federal
or
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
the
--
isn't
it
--
this
is
a
question
of
court
jurisdiction
rather
than
which
law
applies
and
a
federal
law
applies
and
must
apply
because
of
the
structure
of
the
act,
it
will
apply
even
if
it's
in
the
state
court.
in
many
cases,
federal
questions
try
to
take
courts
with
--
upon
which
you
can't
get
into
a
federal.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
it's
so
would
be
--
well
the
money
award
isn't
being
prima
facie
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
national
--
in
railroad
national
board
situation
in
our
congress
specifically
suppose,
all
decisions
of
the
national
board
the
court
reviews
and
there's
only
and
only
the
facts
were
--
of
some
--
sound
by
the
board
where
there
are
some
significance
in
the
court.
now,
your
argument
is
that
the
court
is
--
the
court's
job
stops
with
enforcing
the
award.
that
it
doesn't
go
behind
the
award
to
either
the
facts
of
the
law
and
that
under
this
--
under
this
act,
the
system
board's
decision
is
final
like
an
arbitrator's
decision.
it's
final
and
isn't
it
exposed
to
anymore
reviews
in
our
arbitrator
decision
in
the
301
enforcement
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
really
doesn't
make
much
difference,
does
it,
of
what
the
law
is
applicable
in
the
court
--
in
the
courtroom
wherein
an
action
be
enforced?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
no,
i'm
not
saying
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
saying
--
i'm
saying
that
federal
law
applies
--
the
federal
law
has
the
finality
applies
by
â€“
just
as
you
argue
it,
but
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
of
what
law
is
applicable
to
the
court.
the
court
anyway,
it
doesn't
make
and
in
what
law
is
applicable
behind
the
award.
we're
dealing
up
to
the
making
of
the
award.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
there
isn't
any
thing
to
enforce
--
accept
to
enforce
the
award.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
is
your
argument,
that
it's
final,
even
money
award.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
saying
in
this
specific
case
that
there
is
no
room
for
the
court
to
look
behind
this
award
as
to
upon
the
merit.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
either
the
facts
of
the
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
this
--
on
this
basis
that
it's
merely
a
question
of
which
the
court
didn't
--
if
it's
a
remedy
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
applied
in
a
federal
court.
