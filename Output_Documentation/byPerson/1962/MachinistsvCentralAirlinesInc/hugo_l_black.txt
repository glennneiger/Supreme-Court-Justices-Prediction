in

justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
in
their
reply
where
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
asked
in
the
lower
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
if
the
complaint
shows
facts
which
would
justify
applying
--
exercising
jurisdiction
of
the
[inaudible],
you
wouldn't
claim
that
they
have
to
say
that
this
is
under
1337,
would
you,
originally?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
as
i
recall
it,
the
courts
consistently
held
even
in
criminal
cases
that
an
indictment
need
not
allege
a
particular
statute.
the
facts
bringing
under
it
and
it
may
allege
that
it's
under
one
statute
and
the
facts
may
show
it
under
another.
that's
generally
recognized
already
in
the
indictment,
would
you
draw
a
distinction
in
a
civil
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
facts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
hope
you
got
them
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
was
it
created,
under
what
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
federal
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
federal
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
the
keywords
of
the
statute,
jurisdictional
statute
that
you
think
would
construe
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
that
i
think
you've
just
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
i
thought.
haven't
we
construed
those
in
a
number
of
cases,
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
having
that
same
trouble
now
because
i
wrote
one
many
years
ago,
from
that
arising
under
and
i
can't
remember
the
name
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
have
to
construe
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
that
was
not
the
request
that
his
wife
had
made?m
