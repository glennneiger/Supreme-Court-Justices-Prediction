mr.
luther
hudson
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
under
the
impression
--
i
don't
have
much
time
before
adjournment
so
i
would
say
first
that
i'd
like
to
interpose
a
defense
of
the
state
courts.
i
think
that
counsel
is
a
little
unfair
to
them.
i
have
practiced
in
both
the
state
and
federal
courts
rather
ambidextrously
for
almost
30
years
now
and
i
think
that
the
juries
and
the
judges
come
out
of
just
exactly
the
same
factories.
they
come
out
of
the
same
homes.
they
come
out
of
the
same
schools.
i
don't
think
that
it's
quite
fair
to
say
that
--
or
i'll
put
it
this
way.
i
suppose
that
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
may
go
home
and
tell
their
wives
that
they
are
on
the
best
court
of
the
united
states
and
i
suppose
members
of
this
court
may
say
the
same
thing,
but
i
think
it's
little
unfair
to
say
that
the
state
courts
were
incompetent
to
enforce
federal
law
when
they
do
it
everyday
in
day
in
and
day
out.
now,
i
have
said
that
and
i
have
that
out
of
the
way
so
let
me
argue
the
case.
this
is
nothing
but
a
jurisdictional
case
and
it
is
a
simple
action
filed
on
a
very
brief
complaint
in
a
federal
court
asking
that
an
award
be
enforced.
that's
all
it
is
and
as
i
listen
to
the
opposition,
suppose
this
and
suppose
that
and
point
out
what
might
arise
and
what
might
not
arise,
i
was
wondering
where
in
the
complaint
all
of
those
points
were
raised.
if
i
am
not
mistaken,
that
the
district
court
of
the
united
states,
the
jurisdiction
is
determined
exclusively
from
the
complaint.
i
am
not
mistaken
that
it
is
a
court
of
limited
jurisdiction
and
that
jurisdiction
must
appear
on
the
face
of
the
complaint.
all
in
the
world
this
complaint
says
is,
that
incompliance
with
article
--
he
calls
it
204,
i've
always
called
it
184
because
i
work
out
in
the
united
states
court
annotated,
it's
at
204,
the
parties
entered
into
a
contract
and
the
result
of
that
contract,
an
award
came
about
and
the
man
wants
to
enforce
the
award.
it
does
not
say
that
he,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
has
a
right
given
to
him
by
184.
it
doesn't
say
that
there
is
a
right
there
that
was
denied
by
this
contract
or
by
this
defendant.
it
simply
says
that
he
has
a
contract.
he
doesn't
claim
that
184
says
that
mr.
cornstubble
is
entitled
to
have
his
job
back.”
he
says
that
there's
no
award,
it
says
that.
now,
i
say
he
says
true
that
the
contract
was
ordered
by
congress
that
we
should
enter
into
the
contract.
in
a
sense,
any
contract
action
arising
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
because
i
think
we're
still
free
men
and
we
still
have
the
right
to
enter
into
contracts
and
if
you
carry
the
argument
to
its
complete
absurdity,
then
any
action
to
recover
on
the
contract
is
an
action
arising
under
the
constitution.
it
says,
“i
have
the
right
given
by
the
constitution
to
enter
into
a
contract,”
but
you
do
not
get
the
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court.
you
do
not
get
the
court
of
a
limited
jurisdiction
simply
because
somewhere
in
all
of
this
there
is
a
federal
statute.
the
counts
of
argument
would
be
of
real
sound
to
me.
it
would
sound
to
me
well.
it
would
sound
to
me
perfectly
expressed,
if
you
are
arguing
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
if
you
are
arguing
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
grant
certiorari,
if
you
are
arguing
that
this
court
when
a
federal
statute
have
been
misconstrued,
when
it
had
been
misapplied,
that
when
a
state
court
had
done
something
wrong
with
it
that
this
court
had
jurisdiction.
he's
making
no
distinction
between
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
and
this
court,
and
if
there
is
no
distinction
then
i
don't
belong
here
and
the
circuit
court
was
wrong
in
this
case
and
the
metcalf
case.
if
there
is
no
distinction
between
the
district
court's
jurisdiction
and
this
court's
jurisdiction
under
the
general
jurisdictional
statutes
then
the
trial
court
was
wrong
and
so
were
the
circuit
courts
and
so
am
i.
but
the
reason
there
is
no
jurisdiction
is
just
because
of
the
distinction
between
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
determined
after
the
facts
of
--
mr.
luther
hudson
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
when
a
lawyer
stands
up
to
argue
a
case
before
the
court,
the
traditional,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
always
seem
to
me
to
be
somewhat
like
the
same
lawyer
who
holds
up
a
high
ball
to
his
friend
and
says,
“here
is
to
you”
and
drinks
it
himself.
he,
in
a
sense,
has
intention
of
pleasing
himself
or
his
client
by
his
argument
rather
than
the
court.
now,
i
express
that
view
to
an
english
solicitor
and
had
a
45-minute
lecture,
as
a
result,
as
the
derivation
of
that
phrase
that
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
making
the
court
happy,
that
it
derived
from
the,
i
suppose
law
equivalent
of,
may
the
court
be
pleased
to
agree
with
me
and
grant
my
prayer.
and
that
it
was
used,
he
told
me
and
i'm
sure
he's
right,
in
a
sense
that
may
i
convince
the
court,
may
i
get
the
court
to
agree
with
me.
now,
if
i'm
going
to
get
the
court
to
agree
with
me
in
this
case,
i
think
that
i'm
going
to
have
to
argue
the
case
not
with
a
broad-brush
that
was
used
by
counsel
for
the
petitioners,
but
to
confine
the
argument
as
much
as
i'm
permitted
to
the
exact
facts
of
the
case,
what
is
actually
before
this
court.
what
we
have
here
is
a
case
in
which
a
complaint
was
filed
and
it
was
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
we
haven't
tried
the
case
on
the
merits,
had
the
petitioners
elected
to
accept
order
of
dismissal
and
try
it
in
state
court.
we
might
have
been
here
on
the
merits
and
the
counsel
could
have
pointed
out
how
he
had
been
mistreated
or
i
might
be
able
to
point
out
how
the
texas
court
had
misinterpreted
the
law
depending
on
the
outcome
of
the
trial,
but
it
is
not
that
case.
we
have
here
a
simple
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
to
hear
a
lawsuit.
not
a
theoretical
lawsuit,
not
a
lawsuit
that
might
have
been
filed,
not
involving
questions
that
might
or
might
not
arise,
but
one
that
is
presented
by
the
complaint
filed
in
this
case.
the
complaint
fails
to
show
jurisdiction
for
at
least
two
reasons,
one,
which,
frankly
was
not
raised
in
the
trial
court
of
the
court
below
and
that
is
that
this
complaint
was
based
solely
on
section
1331
(a),
there
being
no
diversity.
and
there
was
a
failure
to
allege
that
each
of
the
individual
plaintiffs
had
a
lawsuit
involving
more
than
$10,000.00.
i
don't
want
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
arguing
the
point,
but
i
do
want
to
suggest
one
thing
to
the
court.
in
the
reply,
petitioners
have
asked
to
leave
to
amend
under,
i
believe
that's
section
1653
with
provides
that
amendments
to
this
--
to
furnish
defective
--
correct,
defective
allegations
or
jurisdictions
may
be
made
on
the
terms
in
the
trial
or
appellate
court.
mr.
luther
hudson
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
yes
sir.
i
--
mr.
luther
hudson
no,
sir.
at
this
court,
we
didn't
raise
it
in
the
lower
court.
i
believe
it's
on
page
8
of
the
reply
brief
for
petitioners,
the
blue
one.
it
is
section
1653.
all
i
want
to
suggest
third
to
the
court
is
this;
there
are
no
cases
under
that
section,
but
i
think
the
undoubted
general
rule
is
that
no
man
can
be
allowed
on
appeal
to
make
incorrect
a
correct
judgment.
mr.
luther
hudson
no
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
i
understand
that
they
would
like
to
include
1337.
mr.
luther
hudson
no
sir,
it
does
not.
that's
the
point.
the
point
is
that
the
petition
in
this
case
was
filed
under
1331
which
has
the
10,000
limitation.
mr.
luther
hudson
well,
i
read
it
as
being
both,
but
for
the
point
i
want
to
make
your
honor,
i
think
it's
--
well,
i'll
assume
it
either
way
or
assume
it's
both.
my
point
is
that
under
this
section,
the
right
to
amend,
adapt
that
any
party
after
he
has
a
judgment
against
him
in
the
trial
court,
can
be
allowed
to
amend
to
show
that
the
trial
court's
judgment
is
wrong.
to
reduce
it
to
absurdity,
a
suit
is
filed
without
diversity
in
the
united
states
district
court
on
an
ordinary
automobile
accident
and
the
court
dismisses
it
because
there's
no
diversity
and
there's
no
federal
question.
so
on
appeal,
leave
is
made
to
correct
it
by
showing
that
the
suit
is
one
which
does
involve
a
federal
question
setting
up
an
entirely
different
cause
of
action.
now,
i
don't
mean
to
make
a
big
point
of
it.
i
just
want
to
say
that
this
particular
statute
has
never
been
interpreted
by
this
court,
but
--
and
i
find
no
cases
under
it.
the
--
but
the
--
i
just
doubt
that
a
--
an
appellate
court
can
render,
can
permit
an
amendment
which
will
make
a
trial
court's
judgment
wrong.
i
think
the
statute
means
that
amendments
may
be
allowed
to
validate
a
judgment
of
the
lower
court
not
to
make
it
incorrect.
now,
that's
rather
narrow
point
and
i'd
like
to
pass
on
to
the
real
point
in
the
case.
mr.
luther
hudson
yes
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
if
--
your
honor,
i'd
say
no
and
yes
and
let
may
put
it
the
--
first,
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
specific
allegation
as
to
the
fact
that
this
was
under
1331
(a),
a
specific
direct
allegation,
my
answer
is
your
honor,
of
course
not.
if
on
the
other
hand,
in
this
particular
instance,
there
was
a
limitation
as
to
what
they
were
claiming
jurisdiction
under,
that
was
the
case
presented
to
the
trial
court.
he
was
told,
we
say
there
is
jurisdiction
here
under
1331
(a).
i
don't
mean
to
intimate
for
one
minute,
had
there
not
been
the
limiting
allegation
that
a
general
allegation
and
the
facts
were
alleged
which
brought
it
under
a
particular
federal
statute
that
it
would
be
defective.
mr.
luther
hudson
your
honor
--
mr.
luther
hudson
--
you
had
me
at
a
terrible
disadvantage.
the
only
criminal
case
i
ever
tried,
i
defended
40,000
cases
[inaudible]
the
only
criminal
case
i
ever
tried.
mr.
luther
hudson
i
got
them
in
a
suspended
sentence.
[laughter]
and
i
don't
know
that
rule,
but
to
be
that
as
it
may
that
the
point
is
here
and
i
don't
want
to
pass
it
by.
now,
let
me
--
mr.
luther
hudson
your
honor,
that
was
to
render
correct
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court,
not
to
make
it
incorrect.
mr.
luther
hudson
then
again,
your
honor,
i
say
that
to
make
it
correct
and
to
obligate
the
necessity
of
the
reversal.
i
don't
question
the
right
of
the
court
to
do
that.
i
doubt
that
the
court
has
--
well,
lawyer
from
the
[inaudible]
ought
not
to
say
the
power
of
this
court.
i'd
say
the
court
should
not
use
the
same
power
to
make
the
correct
judgment
incorrect.
but
let
me
pass
to
the
main
points
in
the
case.
this
is
a
suit
by
six
plaintiffs,
each
of
whom
has
an
award
in
his
favor
and
each
of
whom
wants
to
have
that
award
enforced.
now,
the
award
is
not
under
the
railway
labor
act
in
the
sense
that
it's
under
the
railroad
adjustment
board.
it
is
not
under
the
301
of
taft-hartley
act,
that
type
of
thing.
this
is
a
system
board
of
adjustment.
the
--
mr.
luther
hudson
the
--
there
is
a
statute
184-2045
u.s.
184
which
orders
the
parties
to
enter
into
an
agreement
providing
for
a
system
board
of
adjustment.
the
--
mr.
luther
hudson
yes
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
yes
sir.
that
is
no
question
but
what
the
contract
was
entered
into
under
that
statute
and
that
will
let
me
bring
one
of
the
points
i
want
to
make.
there
are
‘any
number'
of
cases,
i'd
say
any
number,
there
must
be
10
or
15
cases
in
which
both
this
court
and
the
circuit
courts
have
said
that
a
refusal
to
abide
by
that
law
and
enter
into
a
contract
is
a
federal
right.
that
is
the
cause
of
action
to
force
a
compliance
with
that
statute.
there
are
no
cases
which
says
that
--
which
say
that
after
you
have
complied
with
the
statute,
a
cause
of
action
arises
under
it.
i
can
make
an
illustration
your
honor.
in
my
state
as
in
most
states,
there
is
a
statute
that
says,
automobiles
must
be
operated
with
adequate
breaks.
an
allegation
that
the
automobile
was
operated
with
breaks
that
were
inadequate
would
arise
under
that
statute,
but
an
allegation
that
an
automobile
was
equipped
with
adequate
breaks
and
the
statute
complied
with
would
not
rise
under
that.
so
we
come
to
the
single
question
and
i
think
it
is
in
this
case
and
that
is
where
the
plaintiff's
cause
of
action
arises
under
the
federal
law.
and
for
that
purpose,
your
honor,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it's
1331
or
1337.
the
test
arises
is
the
same
under
both.
first,
let's
see
what
the
plaintiff's
complaint
shows.
all
he
says
--
all
he
says
is
that
back
in
1955
or
1957,
i've
forgotten
which,
a
contract
was
entered
into
as
required
by
the
railway
labor
act
between
the
union
and
the
company.
and
then
as
part
of
that
contract,
there
was
a
system
board
of
adjustment
created
that
these
six
individual
employees
were
discharged
and
each
filed
his
grievance
and
each
was
processed
up
to
including
the
system
board
of
adjustment
which
deadlocked
and
a
neutral
was
called
in
and
the
neutral
entered
award
which
ordered
reinstatement
with
back
pay.
and
to
answer
the
question
which
mr.
justice
white
asked,
this
award
is
not
a
money
award
because
the
amount
is
not
stated
in
it.
it
is
merely
that
is
left
for
determination
either
by
the
party's
agreement
or
by
litigation.
so
that
is
the
lawsuit
that
he
alleges.
he
says
he
wants
that
award
enforced
and
for
the
court
to
determine
the
amount
that
he's
entitled
to,
and
order
the
defendant
to
give
him
back
his
job.
now,
let's
stop
there,
attached
to
the
petition
is
a
copy
of
the
award
that
he's
suing
on,
the
award
that
he
says,
“gives
him
a
cause
of
action.”
the
award
that
he
says
entitles
him
to
the
relief
he
asked
for.
that
award
doesn't
mention
the
railroad
labor
act.
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
award
even
by
inference
or
by
a
reference.
it
refers
to
a
contract.
it
refers
to
provisions
for
the
working
of
overtime
and
the
giving
of
notices
for

union

procedures.
he
sues
here
not
by
a
reason
of
statute.
there
isn't
a
statute
in
the
books
that
says
that
he
is
entitled
to
reinstatement.

now,
on
the
face
of
the
complaint,
what
federal
question
is
raised
--
mr.
luther
hudson
the
--
if
you
mean
1331
(a).
mr.
luther
hudson
both
of
them
say
--
i
can
read
them
to
you,
but
they
are
so
close
together
that
it
matters
one
of
them
says
this
1337
arises
under
law
as
regulating
commerce.
and
the
other
one
says
arises
under
the
laws
of
constitution
and
credos
of
the
united
states
i
believe
is
the
phrase.
i'll
read
them
to
you
if
your
honor
--
mr.
luther
hudson
you
have
and
you
have
construed
them
to
mean
and
i
think
the
--
possibly
the
pan
american
case
was
the
latest
one,
i'm
--
one
of
my
greatest
fault
as
a
lawyer
is
not
remembering
the
style
of
the
cases.
i
can
read
them
i
hope
and
i
think
i
can
read
them,
i
know.
and
i
hope
i
can
understand
them,
but
i
have
a
hard
time
remembering
styles,
but
i
think
the
pan
american
is
probably
the
most
recent
case.
mr.
luther
hudson
but
the
--
under
--
mr.
luther
hudson
but
the
--
under
those
cases,
the
fact
that
the
cause
of
action
has
its
origin
in
a
federal
statute,
does
not
give
the
district
court
jurisdiction.
the
cause
of
action
itself
must
be
based
upon
the
statute.
it
must
show
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
under
those
authorities.
it
must
show
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
that
the
constitutionality,
the
construction
or
the
application
of
a
federal
statute
will
be
necessarily
instant
to
a
judgment
in
the
case
and
you
cannot
get
that
into
the
complaint
in
this
case.
the
counsel
for
the
opposition
in
effect
conceded
that
yesterday.
he
was
asked
the
question
whether
--
and
i
believe
it's
mr.
justice
potter
asking
the
question,
whether
or
not
the
failure
of
congress
to
put
a
provision
for
federal
jurisdiction
in
the
airline
portion
of
the
statute
with
inadvertence
and
he
answered
yes.
now,
i
concede
to
some
extent
the
necessity
of
courts
taking
care
of
mistakes
but
i
do
not
concede
the
right
to
include
a
provision,
“suits
to
enforce
awards
maybe
brought
in
the
federal
court.”
i've
got
a
good
story
that
will
illustrate
my
point
and
i
want
to
tell
it
because
it
illustrates
it
and
because
it's
a
good
story.
in
legislature
back
in
1930s
when
i
was
working
away
through
school,
i
remember
a
senator
by
name
mcgregor.
mr.
justice
clark
may
remember
him.
he
was
rather
powerful
and
effective
state
senator.
and
his
wife
was
badly
injured
in
an
accident
because
she
got
on
one
of
these
roads
that
had
a
one-way
bridge.
and
he
started
to
crusade
to
require
bridges
in
texas
to
be
wider
and
he
got
this
bill
passed.
and
it
was
a
slight
mistake
and
he
left
out
the
“g”
of
“bridges”
and
the
statute
required
all
brides
in
texas
to
be
40-feet
between
the
bucker
systems.
now,
that's
large
even
for
texas.
mr.
luther
hudson
no
sir
may
--
i
say
that
the
court
would
i
think,
as
matter
of
reading
the
caption
and
reading
the
emergency
clause,
it'd
be
justified
there
in
inserting
the
“g”.
certainly,
i've
got
married
on
the
assumption
that
the
“g”
was
in
there
and
my
wife
could
not
qualify.
now,
that
--
let
me
make
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
a
minute
ago.
i
don't
question
for
a
minute
that
when
you
have
a
statute
which
clearly
shows
that
it
regulates
bridges
and
that
it
is
--
deal
solely
with
bridges
that
you
can
insert
a
“g”.
but
when
you
have
a
statute
which
plainly
does
not
contain
a
provision
saying,
“suits
to
enforce
the
awards
of
adjustment
boards
shall
be
brought
or
maybe
brought
in
the
federal
court.”
i
humbly
say
that
the
court
cannot
enact
that
statute.
mr.
luther
hudson
no
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
that
your
honor
is
to
–
mr.
luther
hudson
had
the
statute
said
–
mr.
luther
hudson
yes
sir.
my
position
would
be
the
same
as
it
is
now.
mr.
luther
hudson
right,
yes
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
no,
now
you're
pushing
me
a
little
farther
than
i
want
to
go
your
honor.
what
i
say
is
this
statute,
you
just
--
you
didn't
change
the
statute
except
to
provide
the
one
additional
sentence.
had
the
statute
provided
the
mechanics,
had
it
set
up
the
provisions
that
would
be
enforced,
had
it
made
the
provisions
that
are
in
the
contract
and
had
that
provision
in
it,
then
i
would
agree
instantaneously
that
under
1337
at
least
or
under
1331
(a)
if
there's
more
than
10,000
involved,
there
would
be
jurisdiction.
mr.
luther
hudson
you
mean
as
i
had
–
mr.
luther
hudson
the
--
that
would
be
right
your
honor
because
then
the
cause
of
action
would
be
derived
from
the
statute.
mr.
luther
hudson
then
the
question
is
solved.
mr.
luther
hudson
no
sir,
but
it
would
be
one
in
which
congress
has
specifically
provided
federal
court
jurisdiction
as
they
haven't
–
mr.
luther
hudson
oh
certainly.
i
don't
question
that.
mr.
luther
hudson
no
sir,
i
--
if
i
may.
your
honor,
you
asked
me
two
questions.
can
i
answer
them
separately?
mr.
luther
hudson
all
right.
mr.
luther
hudson
yes
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
i
think
they
are
now
and
i
think
they
would
be
then,
yes
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
yes
sir,
i
think
that's
true
in
both
ways.
mr.
luther
hudson
as
the
complaint
was
presented
to
the
district
court,
the
answer
is
yes.
i
say
that.
mr.
luther
hudson
from
this
court,
i
would
like
to
say
it
was
reference
to
that
particular
question,
that
of
course
as
the
substantive
law
evolves,
there
is
a
very
little
of
it
now
as
particularly
--
certainly
as
to
this
particular
type
of
–-
mr.
luther
hudson
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
luther
hudson
your
honor
i
found
one
district
court
case
which
the
--
mr.
luther
hudson
no
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
well,
i
suppose
the
court
will
fashion
a
law
of
some
sort
to
cover
this.
i
will
say
this,
i
was
hoping
that
someone
would
point
out
to
me
as
i
think
you're
leading
up
to
that
the
reason
this
is
final
is
not
because
this
court
says
that
it's
final
or
not
because
the
statute
says
it
is
final
but
because
the
party
said
it
was
final.
and
i
was
hoping
somebody
would
ask
me
that
so
that
i
could
point
out
that's
just
what
i'm
arguing,
that
that
is
the
point
of
the
whole
thing.
if
their
party's
statute
says
that
these
boards
cannot
have
jurisdiction
exceeding
that
of
a
board
under
the
railway
adjustment
act.
now,
it
doesn't
say
they
have
to
be
equal.
it
can
be
anything
up
to
that,
but
no
more.
consequently
this
contract
could
have
had
a
provision
to
the
effect
that
the
award
should
be
prima
facie
evidence.
it
could
have
a
provision
that
either
party
could
sue
on
it.
it
could
have
had
–-
mr.
luther
hudson
it
actually
says
that
--
mr.
luther
hudson
no
sir.
excuse
me
your
honor,
i'm
sorry,
i
answered
too
quick.
if
you
mean
the
labor
contract,
the
union
contract,
yes.
but
as
far
as
the
arbitration
or
the
adjustment
board
contract,
it
says,
“the
award
shall
be
final
and
binding.”
mr.
luther
hudson
yes
sir.
i'd
not
--
i
do
not
want
say
that
as
in
the
present
status
of
the
situation
that
they
are
not
part
of
the
same
agreement.
mr.
luther
hudson
no,
it
excludes
certain
things
from
arbitration
or
from
the
system
board.
mr.
luther
hudson
it
purports,
yes
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
no
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
no
sir.
i
hope
to
--
i
don't
want
to
argue
the
case
on
the
merits,
but
to
be
--
to
answer
your
question
truthfully,
no
sir.
i
hope
to
convince
either
a
state
court
or
a
federal
court.
mr.
luther
hudson
your
honor,
the
field
we're
in
is
so
scarce
of
law,
i
expect
to
take
that
position
in
second,
i
expect
–-
mr.
luther
hudson
probably,
to
the
extent
there
is
any.
mr.
luther
hudson
your
honor,
you
cannot
argue
federal
law
when
there
isn't
any.
now,
to
the
extent
there
is
any,
i'll
be
arguing
it
but
to
the
extent
there
isn't
any,
i'm
going
to
be
arguing
state
law.
mr.
luther
hudson
your
honor,
i
wish
i
was
up
here
arguing
this
on
the
merits
now.
mr.
luther
hudson
correct.
mr.
luther
hudson
they
are
participating
and
fastening
it
and
to
the
extent
that
there
is
federal
law,
to
the
extent
that
there
are
decisions,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
i
suppose
policy.
i
don't
question
that
that
would
govern,
but
to
the
extent
there
is
none,
i
will
argue
a
case
from
hawaii.
i
don't
mean
that
facetiously.
i
mean
to
the
extent
that
there
isn't,
to
the
extent
that
it's
logical,
to
the
extent
that
it
fits
in
with
the
decided
cases.
i
will
–-
mr.
luther
hudson
i
can
very
easily
and
i
can
stay
inside
the
record
and
do
it
your
honor.
this
time,
i
don't
mean
to
tell
the
court
because
when
we
try
this
case,
there
will
be
amended
pleadings.
but
under
the
current
pleading,
the
easiest
one
to
state,
the
one
that
i
think
shows
on
the
face
of
the
record
is
that
these
six
employees
were
discharged
for
two
reasons.
they
were
ordered
to
work
overtime
and
refused.
second,
they
were
told
to
report
and
give
their
reasons
for
their
refusal
which
they
refused
to
do.
the
award
in
this
case
decided
only
that
they
were
justified
in
refusing
to
give
their
reasons
because
the
union
representative
wasn't
present.
he
expressly
refused
to
pass
on
the
right
to
discharge
these
men
for
refusal
to
work
overtime.
my
point
is,
as
i
put
it
in
the
brief,
an
employer
fires
an
employee
for
murdering
his
foreman,
burning
down
the
plant,
and
wearing
a
red
tie.
and
the
arbitrator
decides
that
wearing
a
red
tie
to
work
is
not
grounds
for
firing
him.
consequently,
he
needs
not
to
decide
whether
murdering
the
foreman
or
burning
down
the
plant
were
sufficient
grounds.
mr.
luther
hudson
under
the
contract
that
on
the
face
of
the
award,
he
refused
to
decide
something
that
was
necessary
to
dispose
of
the
case.
mr.
luther
hudson
on
the
base
of
the
plead
--
basis
of
the
pleadings
now
filed,
i
would
argue
that
the
award
is
not
within
the
scope
of
the
contract
that
he
had
no
right
to
decide
only
one
issue
before
him
of
necessity
if
he
had
decide
both
issues.
i
may,
as
i
say,
i
don't
mean
to
mislead
the
court
when
it
gets
back
up
here.
i
don't
want
to
be
somebody
to
remember
what
i
said
and
say,
“no,
that's
all
you're
going
to
claim,”
but
under
the
present
pleadings,
that's
based
to
the
court,
all
right.
mr.
luther
hudson
surely.
mr.
luther
hudson
your
honor,
in
the
few
cases
that
we
had
in
the
past,
that
was
true
partially.
it
was
not
true
in
the
situations
where,
for
example,
insurance
contracts
provided
for
arbitration
of
damages.
those
were
executory
agreements.
there
is
--
it
isn't
true
on
the
other
hand,
the
state
of
texas
after
the
arbitration
agreement
has
been
made
between
parties
enforces
it.
and
here
again,
i'd
like
to
say
that
counsel
has
howling
before
he's
hurt.
there
is,
to
my
knowledge,
no
case
in
texas
to
cause
him
heartburn
over
the
texas
rule
with
reference
to
arbitration
of
labor
disputes.
there's
only
one
that
ever
got
to
the
supreme
court
that
i
know
about
in
the
last
ten
years.
and
there's
certainly
nothing
in
that
case
to
cause
him
to
worry
and
i
think
that
we
would
be
much
better
off
here
to
criticize
the
texas
courts
if
we
had
to
try
this
case
on
the
merits
and
they
had
done
something
real
bad.
they
may
do
something
bad
to
me
your
honor.
mr.
luther
hudson
yes
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
yes
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
i'm
not
there
either.
mr.
luther
hudson
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
your
honor.
but
what
the
federal
law
would
govern
and
the
court
--
state
court
could
and
would
issue
an
injunction
requiring
it.
mr.
luther
hudson
it
would
be
--
mr.
luther
hudson
it
would
your
honor.
that's
the
reason
and
the
distinction
in
this
case.
that
is
the
situation
where
there
is
a
violation,
the
right
given
by
statute.
the
statute
says,
“you
shall
set
up
this
board
and
these
disputes
shall
be
submitted
to
it.”
now,
when
you
don't
do
that,
you
have
violated
an
obligation
by
the
statute.
when
you
do
it,
it's
just
like
my
illustration
about
the
breaks,
your
honor.
mr.
luther
hudson
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
intimately.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
what
the
contract
shall
contain.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
the
parties
must
do
this
and
must
do
that
in
any
detail.
these
can
--
these
contracts
can
be
as
the
court
said
about
labor
contracts
or
railroads,
it's
just
as
bad
as
the
parties
will
stand
for
as
good
as
they'll
agree
on.
mr.
luther
hudson
i
think
about
equally
in
this
--
but
there's
a
difference.
you
remember
that
congress
in
301
says
that
those
suits
shall
be
brought
on
the
federal
court.
mr.
luther
hudson
and
you
remember
that
before
lincoln
mills,
all
the
district
courts
held
that
there
was
no
federal
question
but
right
after
lincoln
mills,
when
they
turn
around,
and
now
there
was
federal
question.
under
that
very
--
because
of
the
fact
that
their
court
had
been
given
--
the
district
court
had
been
given
jurisdiction
of
that
action.
now,
i
don't
mean
to
catch
you
all,
but
i'd
like
to
carry
the
point
a
little
further.
the
provision
there
is
not
applicable
to
airlines
specifically.
there
is
a
provision
with
reference
to
the
railroad
adjustment
board
that's
not
applicable
to
airlines.
and
i
don't,
for
the
life
of
[inaudible],
why
the
fact
that
they
say
that
we're
not
subject
to
this
one
which
says
federal
jurisdiction
and
we're
not
subject
to
that
one,
which
says
federal
jurisdiction,
you
can
construe
that
as
mean
--
they
meant
that
we're
to
be
subject
to
federal
jurisdiction.
i
don't
--
it
just
seems
to
me
that
it
indicates
a
pattern,
but
i'll
go
a
little
further
and
answer
your
question
that
i'm
--
i
hope
that
was
going
to
be
asked
to
counsel
and
that
is,
if
it
was
an
oversight,
if
it
was
a
rank
oversight,
i
don't
think
that
gives
district
court
jurisdiction.
i
don't
think
there
is
jurisdiction
by
oversight.
i
think
that
the
district
court,
united
states
district
court
is
the
court
with
limited
jurisdiction.
mr.
luther
hudson
yes
sir,
your
honor.
but
you're
assuming
the
answer.
and
if
you
let
me
illustrate
i
can
--
mr.
luther
hudson
the
--
because
of
two
reasons,
your
honor.
factually,
under
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
he
says,
“by
contract,
i
have
certain
rights.”
but
secondly,
there
are
many
instances
where
the
man's
rights
are
determined
under
federal
law
where
it
is
exclusively
state
court
jurisdiction.
the
one
that
i
know
best
is
the
federal
employers
liability
act
which
is
part
of
the
railway
labor
act.
it
has
a
safety
appliance
provision
in
it.
now,
that
same
act
says
when
an
employee
is
injured,
he
has
the
right
to
go
into
either
state
or
federal
court.
but
when
a
non-employee,
when
a
passenger
on
a
highway
is
injured
or
i
mean
a
driver
on
a
highway
or
passenger
or
someone
working
on
the
car
is
injured
by
a
safety
appliance
defect,
then
it
has
to
go
into
state
court
but
there
isn't
any
question
but
what
that
state
court
would
be
applying
federal
law
to
decide
the
rights
of
the
parties.
there's
another
illustration
that
goes
out
of
the
same
section
and
that
is
the
three
cases
as
i
remember
them.
there's
the
moore
case
and
the
caldwell,
and
the
slocum,
in
which
this
court
said
that
the
same
plaintiff,
mr.
cornstubble,
has
the
option
when
he's
fired.
he
can
file
a
grievance
procedure
or
he
can
say,
“i'm
fired.”
and
he
can
walk
in
to
the
state
district
court
and
sue
for
wrongful
discharge.
if
he
sues,
he
sues
under
the
same
contract
that
he's
suing
here
and
that
is
exclusive
state
jurisdiction.
i
don't
know
whether
i
answered
your
question
your
honor,
but
that's
–-
mr.
luther
hudson
yes
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
yes
sir.
mr.
luther
hudson
no
sir,
it
was.
i
wish
the
court
had
so
held
but
unfortunately,
this
court
has
held
and
i
have
lost
two
cases
based
on
that
holding,
that
somebody
goes
down
to
unload
a
car,
a
box
car,
or
this
particular
one
was
a
tank
car,
and
there
is
a
defective
running
board
and
that
third
person
that
the
employee
of
the
consignee
is
injured
because
of
a
defect
in
that
running
board
which
the
safety
appliance
act
said
must
be
good,
this
court
has
said
he
got
a
cause
of
action
under
the
safety
appliance
act
but
it's
also
said
that
he's
got
to
bring
it
to
the
state
court.
now,
i
hope
that
you're
--
well,
i
say
i
lost
two
cases
on
that
holding,
i
had
to
–-
mr.
luther
hudson
no
sir,
these
are
not
employees.
now,
if
they
were
employees
then
the
statute
as
i
remember
section
52,
says
that,
“an
action
to
recover,
maybe
brought
in
either
the
state
or
federal
court.”
there's
a
statute
that
specifically
provides
for
concurrent
jurisdiction.
and
i
want
to
say
this
that
as
counsel
said
yesterday,
there
were
two
lawsuits.
we
filed
one
in
the
state
court.
he
filed
one
in
the
district
court.
he
removed
it
and
the
court
held
that
the
removal
was
wrong,
at
the
same
time
they
dismissed
this
one.
it's
pending
down
there
and
i
know
no
reason
since
it's
rather
obvious,
since
the
dowd
and
lucas
cases,
that
they
would
be
at
most
concurrent
jurisdictions
that
i
can
set
that
case
down
for
trial.
i
can
set
it
down
in
april
and
try
it,
and
we'll
come
up
here,
i
don't
--
through
the
state
courts.
and
i
didn't
--
i
haven't
thought
of
it
until
--
frankly,
until
i
heard
the
counsel
arguing
yesterday,
but
i
think
maybe
that's
what
i
ought
to
do.
and
then
we'll
find
out
how
bad
the
state
courts
are.
we'll
find
out
whether
or
not
they
--
they
tried
this
case,
they
applied
federal
law.
we'll
find
out
whether
we
tried
it
on
something
that
didn't
involved
federal
law.
we'll
find
out
whether
they
correctly
applied
it.
and
then
we
will
have
before
this
court
a
fair
sample
of
the
treatment
or
the
mistreatment
that
supported
the
airlines
and
their
employees
under
the
system
board
of
adjustment
award.
mr.
luther
hudson
they
did.
mr.
luther
hudson
i
think
i
could.
mr.
luther
hudson
on
the
basis
that
–
mr.
luther
hudson
on
the
basis
that
the
statute
provides
for
compulsory
arbitration,
therefore,
makes
a
strike
illegal
or
any
matter
that
is
subject
to
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedures.
mr.
luther
hudson
no
sir.
that
--
mr.
luther
hudson
because
the
statute
says
the
parties
shall
submit
grievances
involving
working
conditions
and
those
kinds
of
things
to
board
of
arbitration.
they
say
that
we
must,
so
the
statute
says
you
must
do
that.
mr.
luther
hudson
the
statute
–-
mr.
luther
hudson
no
sir.
it
lets
the
contract
say
what
the
parties
will
have
contract
for.
mr.
luther
hudson
it
derives
from
the
statute.
now,
i
will
say
--
mr.
luther
hudson
yes
sir.
i
will
concede
that
the
cases
have
not
gone
into
the
very
point
you're
making,
your
honor,
that
all
of
the
cases
i
have
read,
make
no
distinction
between
the
railroad
adjustment
cases
bound
for
the
railroad
adjustment
or
the
board
there
or
one
that's
in
or
bound
for
the
system
board.
they
have
been
as
i
--
i'm
not
conscious
in
any
case
that
makes
the
distinction
that
you're
asking
me
about.
now,
i
wanted
to
give
back
the
court
some
time
and
i
think
i've
said
pretty
nice
--
pretty
everything
i
came
to
say,
but
i
want
to
offer
again
if
there's
--
if
our
position
isn't
clear
and
i
have
not
pleased
the
court
to
the
extent
of
conviction.
i
want
to
give
the
court
an
opportunity
to
ask
me
a
question
so
that
i
may
please
the
court.
thank
you
very
much.
