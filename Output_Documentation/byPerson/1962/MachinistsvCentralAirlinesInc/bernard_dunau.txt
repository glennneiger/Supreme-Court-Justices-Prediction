mr.
bernard
dunau
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
bernard
dunau
this
is
an
action
to
enforce
an
award
issued
by
a
system
board
of
adjustment.
we
have
a
right
to
be
in
a
federal
court
with
this
action
if
in
the
words
of
28
u.s.c.
1337
it's
a
civil
action
or
proceeding
arising
under
any
law
of
congress
regulating
commerce.
as
to
any
such
action,
28
u.s.c.
1337
says
you
can
get
into
a
federal
district
court.
our
specific
question
then
has
to
be
when
you
seek
enforcement
of
a
system
board
award,
are
you
presenting
a
claim
which
arises
under
federal
law?
and
as
to
this
decisive
element,
we
are
all
in
agreement.
petitioners,
respondent,
and
the
court
below,
all
agree
that
federal
law
controls
the
enforceability
of
a
system
board
award.
in
the
words
of
the
court
below
at
the
record
page
4445,
note
7,
“federal
law
governs
the
scope
judicial
review
of
an
award
made
by
a
system
board
of
adjustment
under
section
184
of
the
railway
labor
act
since
the
application
of
state
law
to
this
question
would
allow
a
freedom
of
review
incompatible
with
the
purpose
of
the
statute
to
allow
the
parties
to
arbitrate
their
dispute
with
finality.”
when
i
go
to
a
federal
court
with
a
paper
called
complaint
saying,
“i
have
an
award
that
i
want
enforced”
and
the
judge
says,
“why
should
i
enforce
it?”
i
say,
because
the
rail
--
congress
through
the
railway
labor
act
as
amplified
by
judicial
interpretation
has
said
that
if
i
get
an
award,
i
am
entitled
to
have
it
enforced.
therefore,
i
lay
my
claim
for
the
enforcement
of
this
award
on
federal
law
and
laying
my
claim
on
federal
law,
i
am
squarely
within
the
confines
of
the
general
jurisdictional
statute.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
i
hope
that
it's
not.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
it's
1331
or
1337.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
arising
under
questions
is
identical
under
both.
1337
is
more
natural
in
this
case
because
it
is
the
railway
labor
act.
it's
an
act
regulating
commerce
and
that
would
take
care
of
any
questions
of
$10,000
or
less.
so
i
think
it's
more
appropriate
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
think
when
we
say
we
have
a
right
to
go
into
a
federal
court
under
the
general
jurisdictional
statutes,
we
don't
say
that
mean
that
--
there
isn't
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
the
state
courts,
but
that
is
true
whenever
you
can
get
into
a
federal
district
court
by
virtue
of
the
general
jurisdictional
statutes.
now,
the
respondent
says,
“you're
running
too
fast
with
this
argument”.
the
respondent
says,
“a
suit
on
an
arbitration
award
is
a
suit
on
a
contract.
and
therefore,
you
are
not
basing
your
action
on
the
arbitration
award,
you're
not
basing
it
on
the
railway
labor
act,
you're
basing
it
on
the
arbitration
award
on
the
contract.”
you
see
that
seems
to
me
to
be
question
begging,
because
whether
i
have
a
good
action
on
this
contract
depends
upon
federal
law,
its
congress
through
the
railway
labor
act
which
has
said,
“whether
i
have
a
good
claim
or
a
bad
claim.”
and
because
the
law
which
provides
efficacy
to
this
contract
claim
of
mine
is
federal
law,
that's
what
makes
it
a
claim
arising
under
the
railway
labor
act,
an
act
regulating
commerce.
now,
you
take
the
same
contention
put
somewhat
differently.
the
idea
is
expressed
that
here
are
six
employee
seeking
reinstatement
with
back
pay
because
of
a
wrongful
discharge.
now,
nothing
in
the
railway
labor
act
confers
a
protection
against
wrongful
of
discharge.
this
is
conferred
only
by
agreement,
so
our
action
is
not
based
on
the
railway
labor
act
or
any
protection
conferred
by
it;
it
is
instead
based
on
the
contract.
but
all
this
does,
it
seems
to
us,
is
to
push
the
analysis
back
a
few
steps,
but
you
come
out
of
the
same
place.
true,
the
contract
gives
us
the
underlying
right
and
the
parties
would
be
free
or
not
--
the
parties
are
free
as
they
choose
to
incorporate
this
right
into
the
contract.
but
having
incorporated
the
right
into
the
contract,
federal
law
says,
“you
shall
create
a
system
board
of
adjustment
to
decide
any
disputes
over
those
promises.
you
cannot
go
any
place
but
the
system
board
to
adjudicate
those
disputes.”
if
that
process
eventuates
in
an
award,
federal
law
says
that
that
award
shall
govern.
so
it
seems
to
us
that
in
the
end,
no
matter
where
you
begin,
you
come
out
with
an
award
which
we
say
is
enforceable
because
the
federal
law
gives
us
this
right.
mr.
bernard
dunau
on
our
reading,
we
would
be
squarely
within
shultz.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
for
these
reasons:
whether
we
have
a
right
to
then
have
this
award
enforced
depends
upon
whether
we
get
this
right
from
the
railway
labor
act.
whether
we
get
this
right
from
the
railway
labor
act,
involves
a
construction
of
the
railway
labor
act?
whether
in
a
specific
situation
where
we
bring
a
particular
award
with
particular
surrounding
circumstances
to
a
court,
whether
we
will
get
that
award
enforced,
or
whether
that
award
will
be
modified
or
vacated,
turns
on
giving
effect
to
the
railway
labor
act.
we're
putting
it
this
way.
the
federal
law
gives
us
the
standard
for
the
enforcement
of
an
arbitration
award
rendered
by
a
system
board.
that
is
a
construction
of
the
railway
labor
act.
federal
law
tells
us
whether
in
the
particular
circumstances,
this
award
should
be
enforced.
that
is
an
application
of
a
federal
standard.
it
seems
to
us
therefore
that
in
every
meaningful
sense
of
schulz,
this
is
really
and
substantially
a
controversy
over
the
meaning
and
effect
of
a
federal
law.
putting
--
put
it
this
way;
suppose
texas
were
to
say,
“we
don't
think
that
award
should
be
enforced
which
require
the
reinstatement
of
the
employees
particularly
with
a
small
employer
because
that
involves
personal
service
and
that
kind
of
personal
contact
that
something
which
we
find
offensive
as
against
public
policy
if
it's
compelled.
well,
texas
couldn't,
for
a
moment,
begin
to
have
that
kind
of
a
command
under
the
railway
labor
act
because
we
would
say
and
it
would
be
perfectly
clear,
this
is
in
conflict
with
what
congress
has
provided.
congress
has
said
we
can
make
such
promises.
congress
has
said
we
can
have
such
promises
enforced.
so
it's
the
railway
labor
act.
congress
through
the
railway
labor
act
which
gives
us
the
underlying
command
here,
and
that
underlying
command
being
federal
in
nature,
it
seems
to
us,
we
are
squarely
within
the
general
jurisdictional
statutes.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
would
rather
not
as
say,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i'm
afraid
i
would
give
more
ignorance
than
to
shed
light
if
i
try
to
do
that.
what
i
would
say
though
is
i
think
this
thing
can
be
tested
in
another
way.
if
this
is
not
federal
law
which
governs,
then
it's
got
to
be
state
created.
and
if
we
state
created,
we
have
no
business
in
a
federal
court
absolute
diversity.
where
any
place
in
this
process,
the
state
law
like
any
rule
at
all,
state
law
doesn't
compel
the
establishment
of
a
system
board.
state
law
cannot
forbid
the
establishment
of
a
system
board.
state
law
cannot
release
the
parties
from
obligatory
recourse
to
the
system
board.
the
members
of
the
system
board
don't
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
state
law
in
construing
the
agreement.
when
they
enter
an
award,
state
law
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
that
award
should
be
enforced,
modified,
or
vacated.
state
law
doesn't
enter
into
any
place
in
this
process.
if
state
law
doesn't
enter
into
it,
it
cannot
be
state
created.
it
must
be
federal
law
which
we
bring
into
this
case,
and
therefore
we
have
a
right
to
be
in
a
federal
court
with
it.
in
other
words,
when
we
bring
this
paper
into
a
federal
court,
the
only
law
we
are
bringing
in
to
support
our
claim
is
federal
law
as
traditionally
interpreted,
the
railway
labor
act.
now,
if
we
are
right
up
to
this
point,
it
seems
to
us
that
what
the
posture
of
this
case
is,
comes
down
to
as
this.
we
can
get
into
a
federal
district
court
by
virtue
of
this
general
statutory
grant.
we
ca
be
thrown
out
of
that
federal
district
court
only
if
there
is
something
in
the
railway
labor
act
itself
which
says
that
though
congress
in
1875
has
said,
“you
can
get
into
a
federal
district
court
with
a
federal
claim,”
congress
in
1936
in
enacting
the
air
part
of
the
railway
labor
act
has
pro
tanto
repealed
that
general
jurisdictional
grant.
now,
what
is
there
that
can
reasonably
be
said
in
the
railway
labor
act,
the
air
part
to
say
that
the
general
statutory
grant
which
gives
us
our
right
to
get
into
a
federal
district
court
has
been
impliedly
repealed.
now,
the
basic
argument
which
is
made
there
comes
to
something
like
this.
congress
in
the
air
part
has
provided
that
when
the
national
mediation
board
shall
think
it
good
and
fit,
it
may
setup
a
national
air
transport
adjustment
board.
when
it
sets
up
and
if
it
sets
up
a
national
air
transport
adjustment
board,
that
board
will
have
the
same
powers
and
responsibilities
and
all
the
perquisites
of
a
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
and
one
of
the
things
about
a
national
railroad
adjustment
board
is
that
there
is
specific
provision
in
the
rail
part
of
the
railway
labor
act
for
access
to
a
federal
district
court.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
because
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
says
in
effect
that
it's
prima
facie
evidence
of
the
fact
stated.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
it's
hard
to
say
because
you
can
read
these
in
several
ways.
under
the
national
--
under
the
rail
part
it
says,
an
award
is
final
and
binding
except
as
to
a
money
award.
and
then
it
also
says
that
the
award
shall
be
the
prime
facie
evidence
of
the
facts
stated.
now,
i
look
at
that
and
say
the
only
relevance
--
that
the
only
matters
which
are
relevant
in
a
federal
district
court
as
why
shouldn't
this
railroad
adjustment
board
award
be
final
and
binding.
and
as
to
that
issue,
if
the
underlying
merits
of
the
dispute
do
not
seem
to
me
to
be
relevant
and
so
i
don't
think
that
saying
it
has
prima
facie
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
would
--
we
would
argue
that
we
are
entitled
to
something
more.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
would
say
that
under
this
contract,
the
parties
have
contracted
in
their
words
for
final,
and
binding,
and
conclusive
adjudication
with
no
exceptions
with
respect
to
money
awards
that
under
the
railway
labor
act
having
contracted
in
that
way
the
federal
law
says,
“you're
bound
by
your
promise.
this
is
a
good
contract.”
and
we
say,
“one
of
the
reasons
for
parties
exercising
an
option
for
example
under
the
rail
part
not
to
proceed
under
the
national
railway
adjustment
board
matter
but
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
they
can
contract
for
more
finality
if
they
go
the
other
route.
now,
the
congress
did
tell
to
the
national
mediation
board,
when
it
sees
fit
it
can
set
up
this
other
system
and
under
this
other
system,
there
is
a
specific
provision
which
lets
you
get
into
a
federal
district
court.
now,
granting
this
specific
provision,
the
court
below
says.
“well
look,
if
there
is
a
specific
provision
which
lets
you
get
into
a
federal
district
court
from
an
nrab
award
or
from
a
national
air
transport
adjustment
award
had
no
specific
provision
with
respect
to
a
system
board
that
negatively
implies
that
the
federal
district
court
is
close
to
you
and
you
can
go
only
into
a
state
court.
now,
here
i
think
is
a
fit
illustration
for
mr.
justice
holmes'
famous
dictum,
“a
page
of
history
is
worth
the
volume
of
logic”,
because
when
you
look
at
the
specific
reasons
that
congress
setup
his
dual
system,
one
can
see
quite
readily
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
you
should
be
in
a
federal
court
or
in
a
state
court.
the
original
draft
of
this
bill
provided
as
it
now
does
in
exact
terms
for
the
setting
up
of
a
national
air
transport
adjustment
board
when
the
national
mediation
board
shall
see
fit
to
do
so,
but
it
made
no
provision
for
obligatory
creation
of
a
system
board.
the
parties
were
free
to
create
one
or
not
as
they
saw
fit.
if
they
didn't
create
one,
the
national
mediation
board
would
have
to
decide
these
disputes
over
grievances
and
interpretation,
and
application.
and
the
national
mediation
board
at
the
hearing
says,
“this
is
just
nonsense.
we
would
be
inundated
with
work
if
we
have
to
decide
these
grievances
and
contract
disputes.
our
traditional
job
is
to
deal
with
major
changes.”
we,
therefore,
suggest
if
you
don't
think
it's
wise
to
set
up
a
national
air
transport
adjustment
board
now,
that
you
require
the
parties
to
create
an
obligatory
system,
you
make
it
--
you
oblige
the
parties
to
create
their
own
system.
and
so
the
parties
were
obliged
then
this
suggestion
was
adopted,
the
parties
were
obliged
to
create
their
own
system
as
the
equivalent
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
system
and
the
national
air
transport
adjustment
board
was
not
created,
why,
because
congress
said
and
this
appears
in
the
committee
reports,
there
were
then
no
agreements
on
these
air
carrier
properties.
there
would
be
nothing
for
a
national
air
transport
adjustment
board
to
do
and
congress
have
said,
wanted
to
save
the
money
that
would
go
into
setting
up
a
bureaucracy
of
a
national
air
transport
adjustment
board
until
it
was
necessary
to
do
so.
now
if
the
reason
for
the
deferral
of
setting
up
this
national
air
transport
adjustment
board
is
economy-mindedness,
certainly
that
is
not
a
reason
which
shows
that
congress
intended
to
foreclose
access
to
a
federal
district
court.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
i
think
we
can't
use
it
in
our
favor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
but
you're
making
--
you're
extending
the
argument
beyond
i
--
where
i
was
willing
to
carry
it.
mr.
bernard
dunau
there
are
things
in
the
sys
--
in
access
to
a
federal
district
court
under
the
rail
part
which
would
be
favorable
for
example
to
a
person
seeking
enforcement
of
the
award.
he
can
get
his
attorney's
bills
paid.
now,
he's
not
going
to
get
his
attorney's
bills
paid
if
you're
in
a
federal
court
under
the
general
jurisdictional
statute.
on
the
other
hand,
he's
going
to
have
to,
if
he's
got
a
money
award
facing
trial
de
novo
on
that,
in
our
view,
he's
not
going
to
have
to
do
that
if
he
can
get
into
a
federal
district
court
through
a
system
board
which
applies
conclusiveness.
so
i
think
that
you
can
argue
that
two
ways
and
all
we
seek
to
show
is
that
whatever
the
reason
was
for
setting
up
a
national
air
transport
adjustment
board
and
that
is
deferring
its
creation,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
congress
saying,
“we
wanted
these
questions
of
disputes
over
arbitration
of
awards
not
to
be
in
a
federal
court.”
on
the
contrary,
they
didn't
want
to
set
it
up
at
this
point
because
they
wanted
to
save
money.
they
set
up
the
national
--
the
system
board
as
an
equivalent
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
at
least
in
terms
of
getting
a
final
and
binding
disposition
or
a
way
of
disposing
of
these
controversies
and
here,
i
would
carry
the
argument
at
least
to
this
point.
since
there
was
supposed
to
be
duality,
both
of
these
systems
were
supposed
to
be
just
as
good
as
the
other
in
resolving
these
disputes,
if
congress
said
it
wanted
that
these
disputes
to
be
in
a
federal
district
court
when
an
award
was
issued
by
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board,
certainly
carrier
would
argue
that
it
was
not
a
verse
to
have
in
the
same
kind
of
dispute
in
a
federal
district
court
when
the
award
was
rendered
by
a
system
board.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
would
think
it
clearly
that
it
was
simply
an
inadvertence
on
the
part
of
congress.
they
were
concentrating
up
on
another
question,
“how
do
you
resolve
the
dispute
where
you
don't
have
a
national
air
transport
adjustment
board
and
you
don't
want
the
national
mediation
board?”
this
was
the
language
which
was
directed
to
that
problem
and
nothing
in
that
problem
or
the
way
they
handled
it
remotely
imply
that
they
intended
a
pro
tanto
repeal
of
the
general
jurisdictional
status.
mr.
bernard
dunau
ultimately,
we
would
make
that
thing.
mr.
bernard
dunau
oh
yes,
it
does
because
texas
may
have
a
different
rule
as
to
finality
than
alabama,
and
alabama
may
have
a
very
different
rule
than
hawaii
and
if
it's
state
law
that's
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
your
honor
has
suggested
that
a
state
court
is
just
as
good
a
court
as
a
federal
court
to
apply
federal
law,
i'm
not
disposed
to
quarrel
as
to
that
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
that
could
have
raise
in
some
very
substantial
problems
with
respect
to
what
is
the
scope
of
our
review.
well,
i
would
like
to
say
and
hope
that
the
law
will
ultimately
develop
to
a
high
degree
of
finality
and
i'm
not
really
certain
where
the
law
will
go,
that
i
think
it's
going
to
take
a
lot
of
cases
before
that's
going
to
be
settled.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
it
is.
that's
our
argument.
but
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
right.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
let
me
then
answer
it
in
two
steps.
i
say
there
is
no
room
to
look
behind
the
award
as
to
the
facts
or
law
because
federal
law
says
there
is
no
room
to
look
behind
the
award
as
the
federal
law.
so
i
look
to
the
federal
law
and
if
i
am
right
as
to
that,
then
no
one
can
say
i
think
that
the
only
place
i
can
go,
is
to
a
state
court
to
enforce
that
federal
law
because
congress
in
1875
has
since
has
said,
if
i
have
a
claim
founded
on
federal
law
i
have
a
right
to
get
into
a
federal
district
court
or
to
a
state
court
as
i
choose.
mr.
bernard
dunau
but
if
we
wanted
to
be
more
practically,
it
may
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
depending
on
what
state
court
system
you
are
in,
because
no
matter
what
the
state
law
or
no
matter
what
law
may
be
as
it
is
spelled
out
in
the
books
as
it's
applied
at
a
trial
court
level,
it
may
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
whether
you
got
a
sophisticated
judge,
a
sympathetic
judge,
a
judge
who
is
more
congenially
attuned
to
here
as
a
certain
thought
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
certainly
does
your
honor
and
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
[attempt
to
laughter]
there
aren't
as
many,
your
honor,
and
i
suppose
what
i
am
saying
is
in
the
management
of
a
litigation
if
i
can
have
a
choice
between
a
state
court
and
federal
court,
i
can
make
my
choice
based
upon
my
own
judgment
as
to
where
i
am
better
off
and
congress
by
enacting
the
general
jurisdictional
grant
has
said
that
with
respect
to
federal
rights,
you
can
go
to
a
federal
court
and
i
suppose
one
of
the
underlying
reasons
for
that
is
to
remove
parochialism
from
the
enforcement
of
federal
rights
even
though
they
are
supposed
theoretically
to
the
justice
well
enforced
in
the
state
court.
mr.
bernard
dunau
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
think
mr.
justice
black
that
the
case
you
were
thinking
of
that
you
had
written
was
bell
v.
hood.
we
haven't
cited
in
our
brief,
but
it
appears
at
327
u.s.
678.
this
action
to
enforce
a
system
board
award
does
not
exist
in
limbo.
some
law
must
apply
which
says
that
this
action
is
good
or
is
no
good.
that
law,
by
everybody's
concession
is
federal
law.
there
seems
to
us
inescapable
that
once
it
is
said
that
it
is
federal
law
which
makes
this
action
good,
the
case
arises
under
a
law
regulating
commerce
or
under
a
federal
law.
if
that
is
correct,
then
the
general
jurisdictional
statutes
give
us
a
right
to
be
in
a
federal
district
court.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
airport
or
the
railway
labor
act
omitted
a
specific
conferment
of
jurisdiction
by
inadvertence
or
not.
our
question
then
would
be
not
was
there
an
inadvertent
omission
of
jurisdiction
as
specific
to
confirm
it
either
in
the
airport
or
the
railway
labor
act
rather
is
there
anything
you
can
draw
from
the
railway
labor
act
which
would
show
an
implied
repeal
of
the
general
jurisdictional
statutes.
and
unless
there
is
something
in
the
airport
or
the
railway
labor
act
to
show
an
implied
repeal,
we
are
properly
in
a
federal
district
court
because
congress
since
1875
has
said,
“if
you
have
an
action
arising
under
a
law,
regulating
commerce
or
under
a
federal
law,
you
maybe
in
a
federal
district
court.”
now,
let's
illustrate
it
in
this
case
by
the
very
point
mr.
hudson
says,
he
wants
to
make
whenever
he
gets
to
a
court
to
try
this
case
on
the
merits.
he
says
that
an
arbitrator
here
made
a
mistake
because
as
he
concedes
that
there
were
two
issues
to
be
decided.
the
arbitrator
decided
one
issue
and
rendered
a
judgment
based
or
rendered
an
award
based
solely
on
that
one
issue.
that
award
is
therefore
void
because
it
didn't
decide
all
the
things
that
should
have
been
decided.
the
contract
here
says
that
the
award
shall
be
final,
binding,
and
conclusive.
how
far
back
a
final,
binding
and
conclusive
responding
can
go
to
show
error
becomes
a
question
of
federal
law,
because
it
is
federal
law
which
will
spell
out
whether
our
contract,
when
it
says
final,
binding
and
conclusive
means
utter
finality
so
that
you
cannot
go
back
of
it
at
all.
it
means
almost
utter
finality
so
you
can
go
back
off
it,
somewhat
to
show
some
basic
prejudicial
defect,
like
bias
of
the
arbitrator
or
fraud,
or
it
can
go
back
a
good
deal
further
to
show
that
there
was
not
enough
evidence
to
support
the
award,
or
it
can
go
all
the
way
back
and
redo
the
whole
thing
de
novo.
but
whether
you
give
it
utter
finality
or
give
it
no
finality
at
all,
depends
upon
what
the
federal
law
is.
so
it
seems
to
us
inescapable
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
question
of
federal
law,
a
case
arising
under
it.
we
have
a
claim
which
must
bring
--
which
must
have
support
from
some
law
and
the
only
law
we
have
is
federal
law.
now,
this
is
not
a
question
of
invidious
comparison
between
state
courts
and
federal
courts
as
one
better
than
the
other.
congress
has
said
when
it
enacted
the
general
jurisdictional
statutes
that
for
the
enforcement
of
federal
rights,
you
can
go
into
a
federal
court.
now,
if
there's
any
invidiousness
in
this
field,
it's
because
the
general
jurisdictional
statutes
have
said
they
want
--
the
congress
wants
two
court
systems
at
work
here
and
we're
not
here
saying
we
want
to
be
in
a
federal
court
because
we
like
federal
courts
better
than
state
courts
or
we
think
state
courts
are
worst
than
federal
courts.
we
are
in
a
federal
court
because
congress
says
with
this
kind
of
a
claim
we
can
be
in
a
federal
court.
now,
in
any
specific
case,
the
lawyer
make
--
may
have
a
big
mistake
as
to
his
choice
are
forum
and
not
know
until
he's
all
through,
that
he
has
made
a
mistake,
but
obviously,
one
doesn't
decide
jurisdictional
questions
on
that
kind
of
an
invidious
basis.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
we
are
not
arguing
that.
we
are
arguing
that
we
--
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction.
if
we
bring
it
in
a
state
court
or
if
the
other
party
brings
it
in
the
state
court,
there
can
be
a
remand
to
a
federal
--
there
can
be
a
removal
to
a
federal
court,
so
in
that
sense
there
is
a
control
over
the
forum
if
a
party
wants
to
be
in
any
federal
court.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
not
a
question
before
you.
no
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
question
here
is
the
plaintiff
having
sought
--
started
his
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
has
he
based
it
on
a
law
regulating
commerce?
if
he
has,
he
has
a
right
to
be
in
the
federal
district
court
because
congress
has
said
he
can
be
there.
now,
let
me
point
out
–-
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
statute
doesn't
say
specifically
when
it
confers
jurisdiction
on
a
federal
district
court
to
enforce
an
nrab
award
that
it's
exclusively
in
the
federal
district
court.
i
read
it
that
way,
but
i
think
it's
open
to
argument
that
it
may
not
be
that
way.
i
read
it
that
way
because
there
are
certain
other
perquisites
to
getting
into
a
federal
district
court
like
attorney's
fees
that
can
be
paid
if
you
prevail,
the
cost
of
the
suit
are
borne
out
of
the
appropriations
of
the
united
states
courts,
these
things
may
show
that
under
the
--
when
you
bring
a
suit
in
effect
--
that
the
only
place
you
can
bring
an
nrab
suit
to
enforce
an
award
is
in
a
federal
district
court.
now,
what
we
say
here
is
that
if
you
want
to
distinguish
between
what
you
can
do
with
the
system
board
award
and
an
nrab
award,
the
differentiation
would
be
that
for
an
nrab
award,
you
must
go
only
into
a
federal
court.
with
a
system
board
award,
you
may
go
either
into
a
federal
court
or
into
a
state
court.
but
the
differentiation
does
not
argue
in
favor
of
saying
that
the
only
place
you
can
go
with
this
kind
of
a
suit
is
into
a
state
court
which
is
the
argument
that
is
made
here
by
the
respondent.
now,
i
think
i
can
illustrate
this
by
two
things
which
have
already
been
adverted
to
and
may
profitability
perhaps
be
repeated.
now,
the
court
below
bases
its
view
on
two
things.
it
speculates
that
in
1936,
state
courts
were
hostile
to
the
enforcement
of
an
executory
agreement
to
arbitrate,
but
favorable
to
the
enforcement
of
an
award
once
it
is
rendered.
now,
in
texas,
it
happens
--
the
law
happens
to
be
the
common
law
rule
that
you
can
revoke
in
executory
agreement
to
arbitrate
at
any
time
prior
to
actual
submission.
now,
the
court
says
because
the
state
courts
were
hospitable
to
the
enforcement
of
an
award,
we
imply
that
congress
was
willing
to
have
this
whole
system,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
enforcement
of
an
award,
be
committed
exclusively
to
the
state
court
system.
but
you
take
that
same
speculation
and
the
court
has
been
saying
because
the
state
courts
are
inhospitable
to
the
enforcement
of
the
executory
agreements
to
arbitrate,
well
that
kind
of
a
suit
you
can
get
in
to
a
federal
district
court.
that
means
if
you
carry
it
out,
that
i
can
sue
central
airlines
to
force
them
to
go
through
arbitration
and
get
into
a
federal
district
court
to
do
that.
having
done
that,
if
an
award
issues
then
the
federal
district
court
has
no
power
to
bring
to
fruition
the
very
thing
that
it
has
the
power
to
start,
we
can't
cut
this
baby
in
half
there.
if
the
federal
district
court
has
the
power
to
enforce
the
executory
agreement
to
arbitrate,
it
surely
must
have
the
power
to
carry
through
the
process
and
enforce
the
award
and
the
other
part
is
the
one
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
mentioned.
if
a
federal
district
court
has
the
power,
as
we
think
it
has,
to
enjoin
a
strike
if
a
dispute
is
pending
before
an
adjustment
board,
certainly
it
has
the
power
having
protected
the
process,
then
bring
it
to
fruition
by
enforcing
an
award
which
eventually
raises
from
that
procedure.
