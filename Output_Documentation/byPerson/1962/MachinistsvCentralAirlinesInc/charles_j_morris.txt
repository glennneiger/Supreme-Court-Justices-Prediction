mr.
charles
j.
morris
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
the
court.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
question
of
whether
the
general
jurisdiction
statutes
confer
upon
the
federal
district
court’s
jurisdiction
to
enforce
a
system
board
award
of
an
airline
system
board
made
pursuant
to
the
railway
labor
act,
section
204
of
that
statute.
the
facts
may
be
very
briefly
stated,
this
is,
in
many
respects,
a
very
ordinary
arbitration
type
case.
there
were
six
employees
who
were
requested
to
work
overtime.
they,
for
various
reasons,
which
were
stated
in
the
arbitration
or
system
board
record,
declined
to
work
overtime.
they
were
then
given
a
letter
specifically
asking
them
to
further
declining
to
work
overtime.
they
were
given
letters
of
suspension
by
the
company
advising
them
that
they
were
suspended,
but
were
to
report
for
an
interview
the
following
monday
morning.
these
events
that
i've
just
described
occurred
between
thursday
and
saturday
during
the
early
part
of
april,
1958.
they
then
did
report
as
requested
but
with
a
union
representative.
the
union
representative
went
into
the
interview
room
and
requested
an
opportunity
to
be
present
at
this
interview
and
was
denied
that
opportunity.
the
employees
thereupon
declined
to
present
themselves
if
they
were
not
permitted
to
have
their
union
representative
present
whereupon
that
same
day,
they
were
given
another
letter
advising
that
they
were
discharged.
this
is
the
sum
and
substance
basically
of
the
case
as
presented
to
the
arbitration
board.
i
use
that
word
“arbitration
board,”
i
would
be
more
correct
to
use
the
term
“system
board”
because
this
is
the
term
which
is
used
by
the
railway
labor
act
and
by
the
contract
which
we
have
here.
the
matter
went
to
the
system
board
of
arbitration
which
was
set
up
pursuant
to
a
contract.
the
board
consisted
of
two
members
of
the
company,
two
members
from
the
union.
they
deadlocked
and
pursuant
to
the
procedure
set
up
under
that
contract,
a
neutral
was
brought
in,
appointed
by
the
national
mediation
board.
the
neutral
sat
with
the
board.
further
hearings
were
held
and
in
due
time
an
award
was
rendered.
the
award
was
joined
in
by
the
union
members,
not
joined
in
by
the
company
members.
it
constituted
a
majority
award
of
the
board,
finding
that
the
company
violated
the
contract
by
denying
union
representation
and
finding,
based
merely
upon
that,
that
the
discharge
was
in
violation
of
the
contract,
ordered
the
employees,
reinstated
and
made
whole
as
to
their
lost
pay.
the
company
declined
to
abide
by
the
award.
it
is
paired
from
this
record
so
i
will
mention
it
that
various
things
happened
rather
promptly.
the
company
filed
a
case
in
state
court
to
set
aside
the
award.
the
union
responded
by
filing
a
motion
to
--
filing
a
removal
petition
to
federal
court,
but
prior
to
doing
so,
filed
the
instance
suit
for
enforcement
of
the
award
in
federal
district
court.
this
case
turns
on
the
complaint
in
as
much
as
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed
simultaneous
with
a
motion
to
remand
the
case.
the
federal
district
court,
facing
his
decision
upon
the
metcalf
case
which
had
just
been
determined
by
the
fifth
circuit,
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
granted
the
motion
to
remand.
the
--
i
might
add
so
i
guess
there
has
been
a
question,
nothing
has
happened
in
the
state
court.
state
court
is
simply
waiting
on
the
outcome
here.
so
much
for
the
facts
of
the
case;
the
--
perhaps
the
best
statement,
and
we
don't
contest
this
of
the
rule
of
federal
jurisdiction
that
we
are
concerned
with,
is
contained
in
the
cardozo
opinion
in
gully
versus
first
national
bank.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
we
call
attention
particularly
to
what
i
think
is
the
crucial
sentence
there,
that
is
the
federal
nature
of
the
right
to
be
established
is
decisive
and
therefore,
i
address
myself
to
the
federal
nature
of
the
right
which
we
seek.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
decisive
on
the
question
of
federal
jurisdiction
in
terms
of
stating
a
case
--
a
question
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
this
is
the
rule
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor.
i
would
ask
the
indulgence
of
the
court
if
you
would
look
with
me
at
our
appendix
in
our
brief
because
carrying
us
through
the
nature
of
this
federal
right
means
carrying
us
through
the
statutes.
and
the
statutes
are
somewhat
tortuous
and
if
they
are
tortuous,
it
is
only
because
congress,
in
enacting
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act
to
be
applicable
to
airlines,
it
sought
and
in
my
opinion
succeeded
in
granting
a
coequal
status
to
the
enforcement
procedures
for
airlines,
coequal
to
what
had
previously
been
granted
10
years
prior
in
1926
to
the
railroad
and
to
the
railroad
unions.
and
i
submit
that
it
is
a
mere
historical
accident
that
the
differences
appear
at
the
present
time
between
the
dispute
settlement
under
the
railway
portion
of
that
statute
and
the
airline
portion.
both
portions
provide
for
two
methods
of
dispute
settlement
in
minor
disputes
and
this
will
appear
as
we
look
at
this,
but
i
will
mention
it
first.
the
railway
labor
act,
as
you
know
under
the
rail
portion,
sets
up
a
national
railway
adjustment
board
with
various
divisions,
but
it
also
sets
up
an
optional
contractual
means
whereby
the
parties
can
use
system
group
or
regional
boards
of
adjustment.
this
we
will
note
specifically
in
a
moment.
under
the
air
portion,
for
reasons
which
mr.
dunau
will
go
into
in
greater
detail,
congress
in
1936
simply
provided
that
the
national
mediation
board
could,
if
it
desired,
set
up
a
national
board
of
adjustment
applicable
to
the
airline
industry.
but
also
set
up
as
a
matter
of
compulsion
and
this
is
compulsory
arbitration,
make
no
mistake
about
it,
set
up
a
form
of
compulsory
arbitration
under
section
204,
but
also
pointed
out
in
section
205
that
in
the
event,
the
national
mediation
board
did
set
up
the
airline
national
board
of
adjustment,
then
exactly
the
same
option
would
apply
to
the
airline
industry
as
would
have
--
as
presently
applies
to
the
railroad
industry.
so,
there
was
that
congressional
intent
to
create
absolute
coequality
there,
but
as
a
matter
of
historical
accident,
we
find
two
things
--
three
things
to
have
occurred.
one,
the
railroads
and
their
unions
have
preferred
generally
to
use
the
national
procedures;
that
is
the
formal
procedure
of
the
railway
adjustment
board.
very
few
railroads
and
very
few
unions,
although
there
are
some
and
we
know
of
three
cited
federal
court
cases
all
but
one
courts
of
first
jurisdiction
noting
that
such
system
boards
do
exist.
they
do
exist
on
the
railroad,
they
are
not
common.
on
the
other
hand,
the
airlines
have
found
the
system
board
procedure
to
be
quite
satisfactory
generally
and
there
is
no
effort
that
anyone
appears
to
be
aware
of
to
put
into
effect
a
national
board
of
adjustment
applicable
to
the
airlines.
but
i
give
you
this
predicate
by
way
of
showing
that
there
was
not
a
congressional
intent
to
create
a
difference
between
airlines
and
railroads,
but
rather
both
portions
of
the
statute
apply
the
same
type
of
procedures
and
leave
it
more
or
less
to
the
party,
that's
to
--
and
to
the
national
mediation
board
i
should
say
as
to
which
will
become
predominant.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
to
the
adjustment
board,
no.
i
would
say
that
there
would
not
be
in
as
much
as
the
parties
have
set
up,
there
are
more
informal
procedures
in
a
way
which
would
be
comparable
to
arbitration
under
section
301.
there
are
no
provisions.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
there
are
three
reported
cases
which
indicate
that
the
courts
have
looked
at
the
matter.
there
are
no
cases
which
either
dispute
or
fail
to
dispute
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
to
determine
this.
this
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
yes,
that
is
the
problem
here,
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
no.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
no.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
i
would
say
--
i
would
say
yes,
just
as
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
here.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
and
for
the
same
reasons.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
i
would
say
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
i
would
say
if
anything
at
the
present
time,
there
is
more
reason
to
find
jurisdiction
on
the
airline.
i
don't
think
your
honors
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
no,
there
are
no
cases
on
it.
it's
more
or
less
an
assumption
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
well,
there
are
cases
on
the
airlines,
the
metcalf
case
which
we
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
and
that's
when
--
and
one
lower
court
case
which
came
out
recently.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
yes,
indicating
the
existence
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
yes,
but
whether
the
jurisdiction
was
there
based
on
diversity
or
not,
my
recollection
is
it
does
not
even
appear
in
the
recorded
opinions.
the
point
of
this
question
has
not
been
raised
there.
it's
not
likely
to
be
raised
because
this
is
a
rather
unusual
form
for
the
rail
industry.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
i
would
say
yes.
a
fortiori
so
because
and
to
answer
a
question
which
justice
white
put
to
me
a
moment
ago,
at
the
present
time,
there
is
greater
reason
to
find
jurisdiction.
i
don't
think
the
court
need
to
reach
this
but
there
is
certainly
a
greater
reason
to
find
jurisdiction
here
because
there
is
the
compulsion
to
set
up
the
system
board
rather
than
the
option
to
set
up
the
system
board
as
it
exists
at
the
present
time
under
section
204.
in
other
words,
absent
creation
of
a
national
adjustment
board
for
the
airlines
it
is
absolutely
compulsory
for
the
airlines
and
the
air
carrier
unions
to
use
this
procedure.
this
difference
does
exist
and
we
would
be
deluding
ourselves
that
we
did
note
that
difference.
your
honors,
will
look
at
the
pertinent
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
the
national
board
is
set
up
by
a
statute.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
by
a
statute.
and
then
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
that's
right,
optionally
they
can
set
up
a
system
board
if
they
did
that.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
well,
the
system
board
is
made
compulsory
in
section
204.
there
is
no
choice
upon
the
parties.
in
section
205,
the
national
mediation
board
is
given
the
option,
not
the
court
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
--
it
is
given
the
option
to
set
up
the
board
if
and
when,
if
ever
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
--
one
were
set
up,
then
the
party
would
revert
exactly
to
the
airline
--
to
the
railway
system.
first,
i
would
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
with
law
which
is
unquestionably
and
i
say
unquestionably
because
it
was
--
it's
conceded
by
all
of
the
parties
here
including
the
court
below
that
we
are
dealing
with
federal
law.
that
whatever
it
is,
whatever
enforcement
we
are
seeking,
it
is
--
we
must
look
to
federal
law
to
find
our
guidelines.
now,
the
basis
for
that
--
for
the
initial
basis
for
the
federal
law,
that
is
the
general
basis
would
be
in
the
statute
itself,
the
railway
labor
act
which
sets
out
a
requirement
of
collective
bargaining
and
the
entering
into
of
collective
bargaining
contracts.
if
you
will
look
at
page
59
of
our
appendix,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
first
set
out
and
under
subheading
five
of
section
2,
the
parties
and
the
railway
labor
act
are
to
provide
for
the
prompt
that
is
the
act
itself
is
to
provide
for
the
prompt
and
orderly
settlement
of
all
disputes
growing
out
of
grievances
or
out
of
the
interpretation
or
application
of
agreements.
now,
i
go
through
this
and
i
beg
your
indulgence
because
this
is
the
fabric
from
which
these
items,
or
the
fabric
from
which
this
court
and
the
federal
courts
must,
if
i
may
use
the
term
“find
the
source”
of
the
federal
law.
actually
it's
not
a
great
deal
or
--
i
shouldn't
say
not
a
great
deal
of
fashioning
a
federal
law
is
required,
of
course,
there
is
interpretation
but
certainly
not
the
degree
of
interpretation
which
is
required
under
section
301.
section
301
is
short,
is
cryptic
and
forms
the
basis
not
just
for
jurisdiction
as
we
all
know,
but
for
the
substantive
federal
law,
relating
to
collective
bargaining
contracts.
here,
just
as
in
section
301
is
the
fabric
of
that
substantive
law
relating
to
enforcement
of
system
board
awards.
under
the
general
duties,
under
section
2
first
and
this
is
somewhat
unlike
taft-hartley
where
a
requirement
of
bargaining
is
put
upon
the
carrier.
here,
there
is
the
following
requirement.
it
shall
be
the
duty
to
exert
every
reasonable
effort
to
make
and
to
make
would
be
comparable
to
the
8
(a)
(5)
duty
under
taft-hartley,
to
make
and
maintain
and
this
goes
beyond
taft-hartley,
to
make
and
maintain
agreements.
here
is
the
federal
system
setting
out
a
requirement
of
maintaining
the
agreement
right
in
the
act
itself.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
no.
not
only
a
contract
right.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
it's
184,
it
is.
it
is
not
purely
and
simply
a
contract
right,
you
will
look
as
the
states
would
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
now,
i've
used
expression
204,
that's
the
railway
labor
act
form,
the
u.s.c.
form
is
184.
i
think
we've
used
204
in
our
appendix.
but
if
you
will
look
at
page
64,
we
see
precisely
now
the
system
board
that
we're
talking
about
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
i
think
this
doesn't
require
very
much
interpretation
and
a
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
no.
well
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
well,
there
will
--
every
statute
must
have
the
interpretation.
this
is
really
a
short
statute,
but
by
comparison
with
301
it's
a
rather
long
statute
and
there
is
much
language
available
to
the
court
here,
much
more
than
was
available
in
section
301.
but
to
look
at
the
language
of
204,
first
paragraph
sets
up
the
disputes
growing
out
of
grievances
or
out
of
the
interpretation
or
application
of
agreements
concerning
rates
of
pay
rules
or
working
conditions
shall
be
handled
in
the
usual
manner,
et
cetera
and
then
they
may
be
referred
by
petition
of
the
parties
or
by
either
party
to
an
appropriate
adjustment
board
as
hereinafter
provided.
now,
here
is
the
fabric,
the
federal
right
is
created,
the
right
to
go
to
an
adjustment
board
which
is
set
up
in
this
portion
of
the
statute
the
second
paragraph.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
this
is
a
federal
question.
where
is
the
finality?
we
submit
that
we
have
agreed.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
it
is
suggested
if
you'll
bear
with
me,
your
honor,
it
is
not
only
suggested
but
spelled
out
i
think
in
words
which
are
incorporated
by
reference
and
this
the
tortuous
path
which
i
have
to
take
you
through
but
if
you
want
to
jump,
jump
to
it;
if
you
will
look
to
section
--
page
62,
section
3,
2d
because
this
is
incorporated
by
reference.
if
you
will
notice
that
the
parties
in
the
second
paragraph
of
204
are
required
by
duty
to
establish
a
board
of
adjustment
of
jurisdiction
not
exceeding
the
jurisdiction
which
may
be
lawfully
exercised
by
system
group
or
regional
boards
of
adjustment
under
the
authority
of
section
3
title
i.
now,
if
you
look
at
section
3
title
i,
you
see
that
the
only
paragraph
which
exists
there
and
this
is
the
paragraph
i
was
referring
to
in
the
opening
of
my
argument,
the
only
paragraph
which
exists
there
describing
the
system
group
or
regional
board,
is
this
paragraph
which
refers
to
the
establishment
of
system
group
or
regional
boards
of
adjustment
for
the
purpose
and
here
is
the
language,
for
the
purpose
of
adjusting
and
deciding
and
these
are
the
terms
which
exist
here,
adjusting
and
deciding
disputes
of
the
character
specified
in
this
section.
now,
what
are
disputes
of
the
character
specified
in
this
section?
we
then
again
incorporate
by
reference,
the
paragraph
(i)
of
section
3
which
is
on
page
60.
and
here,
the
nature
of
the
disputes
which
are
referred
to
are
set
out
and
these
are
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
yes,
i
would
so
argue.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
contrary
to
the
national
board
because
it
is
our
opinion
that
the
parties
would
have
the
right
to
contract
for
that.
they
are
given
the
right
to
contract
for
that.
now,
is
this
a
question
of
exceeding
the
jurisdiction
or,
does
this
go
beyond
or
does
it
not
go
beyond?
this
is
a
question
which
this
court
does
not
have
to
meet.
the
point
is
you
will
look
to
the
statute
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute
to
determine
the
degrees
of
finality.
the
law
of
course
is
not
developed
yet.
we
don't
know
the
extent
of
finality.
i
may
be
just
flat
wrong
in
the
statement
that
i
made
to
you,
mr.
justice
white.
i
may
be
flat
wrong
there.
this
is
certainly
contested
probably
by
my
opposition,
but
you
look
to
this
federal
law
to
determine
these
things.
when
we
look
to
the
law
to
determine
the
duty,
if
the
duty
is
set
out
there,
the
duty
to
establish
the
board
is
set
out
in
the
federal
law.
we
know
that
it
is
exclusive
that
the
--
and
the
decision
so
hold
that
it
is
ex
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
you
look
to
the
federal
law
because
section
204
imposes
a
duty
to
--
on
the
parties
to
setup
a
system
board.
they
are
left
no
option.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
alright.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
that
is
correct
except
generally
and
this
court
has
held
in
such
cases
as
hanson
relating
to
the
union
shop
question,
steele
and
louisville
and
other
cases.
those
come
to
mind
that
the
imprimatur
of
the
federal
statute
is
on
that
collective
bargaining
contract
and
what
the
parties
put
in
that
collective
bargaining
contract
is
a
matter
of
federal
law.
there
is
no
state
authority
for
railroads
and
for
unions
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining
and
create
collective
bargaining
contracts.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
yes.
and
you
look
to
the
basic
source.
you
look
to
the
federal
statute
which
is
the
railway
labor
act
which
forms
the
basis
for
this
collective
bargaining
and
the
creation
of
these
collective
bargaining
contracts.
this
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
yes,
i
would
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
i
would
care
because
the
policy,
the
national
policy
is
set
out
in
the
railway
labor
act
and
we
have
to
look
to
that
and
i
did
briefly
allude
to
some
of
the
provisions,
not
all
of
them,
we
have
to
look
to
some
of
that
to
determine
the
interpretation
here.
we
can't
look
to
50
different
states
for
instance.
we
already
looked
to
this
in
the
cases
where
unions
among
the
airlines
have
been
enjoined
for
striking
over
minor
disputes.
now,
before
a
federal
court
can
determine
that
they
have
struck
over
a
minor
dispute,
that
court
must
look
at
the
collective
bargaining
contract,
at
the
system
board
of
adjustment
and
must
look
at
the
scope
of
it
and
apply
a
standard
as
to
whether
or
not,
there
has
been
a
dispute
relating
to
something
which
could
have
been
settled
by
the
procedure
set
up
and
this
determination
must
be
made.
mr.
charles
j.
morris
oh!
yes,
this
is
exactly
what
the
court
said
in
chicago
river
with
regard
to
national
adjustment
boards
and
the
courts
have
generally,
without
any
distinction,
applied
the
same
rationale
to
system
boards
on
the
airlines
pointing
out
that
a
strike
over
a
minor
dispute
is
in
violation.
now
--
mr.
charles
j.
morris
i
don't
think
we
have
to
question
that
here,
your
honor.
what
we're
saying
rather
what
the
respondent
is
saying
either
here
we
have
a
federal
question
but
the
state
--
but
the
federal
courts
do
not
have
jurisdiction.
we're
not
concerned
here
about
concurrent
jurisdiction.
what
we
are
concerned
about
is
whether
not
the
federal
courts
have
the
right
and
the
authority
to
enforce
federal
law.
now,
it
may
be
that
it
is
possible
for
the
congress
and
of
course
it
is
possible
presumably
for
congress
to
cede
all
jurisdictions
to
a
state
court,
but
this
would
take
a
specific
statute
which
is
nonexistent
here.
there
is
no
statute
ceding
such
jurisdiction.
the
most
that
can
be
claimed
is
that
there
is
that
concurrent
jurisdiction.
just
briefly,
i
would
mention
this
to
your
honors
that
the
majority
opinion
recognized
that
there
were
great
variations
in
the
standards
which
would
apply
and
to
point
out
the
states
statutes
said
these
statutes
vary
greatly
in
their
coverage,
in
their
procedural
requirements,
and
courts
in
different
states
vary
greatly
in
the
extent
of
the
review
which
they
gave
to
arbitration
awards.
they
vary
greatly
in
their
extent
to
review.
where
do
we
look?
do
we
look
to
the
states?
we
submit
you
look
and
you
must
look
to
the
federal
standard
which
must
come
if
it
comes
anywhere
from
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
interpretation
of
that
act
by
the
federal
courts.
thank
you.
