justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
ground
on
which
you
say
you
distinguish
and
say
that
this
one
should
have
been
dismissed
for
what
reason?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
failed
to
state
the
cause
of
action?
justice
hugo
l.
black
failed
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
basis
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
its
--
it
was
based
was
it
on
the
fact
that
it
was
summoning
him
to
bring
those
papers
was
equivalent
to
compulsory
production
of
papers
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
make
the
nonproduction
of
them,
a
confession
of
the
allegation
which
pretended
they
were
proved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
here,
suppose
a
man
is
summoned
to
appear
in
a
wholly
wrongful
summoning,
he
does
not
appear,
what
happens
to
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
you're
using
it
less
euphoniously,
euphemistically
that
he
would
then
be
subject
to
be
prosecuted
for
failing
to
appear.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
in
the
boyd
case,
i'm
trying
to
get
whether
there
any
distinction,
in
the
boyd
case,
tell
not
the
mere
facts,
he
would
get
those
papers
later
that
he
was
trying
to
get
those
papers.
but
when
they
summoned
him
to
get
them
with
the
knowledge
that
if
he
didn't
produce
them,
he
could
be
prosecuted,
they
had
violated
his
rights.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
do
you
keep
emphasizing
privacy?
the
first
amendment,
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
use
the
word
privacy.
can
you
either
reduce
or
expand
the
scope
of
the
first
amendment
by
taking
in
however
much
has
been
used,
the
word
privacy
in
substituting
it
for
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
one
of
the
reasons.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
one
of
the
many.
it
would
be
quite
a
different
amendment
would
it
not
if
it
had
said
a
man's
right
of
privacy
shall
not
be
invaded?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
addressed
in
its
language
that
its
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
search
for
those
papers
and
the
unreasonable
seizure
of
--
then
you
have
to
pass
on
it.
it
maybe
that
the
facts
it's
a
particular
type
of
thing
its
done
would
be
--
consider
them
to
--
determining
whether
or
not
it's
reasonable.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there'd
been
much
talk
about
the
privacy
which
tends
to
reduce
the
value
of
the
fourth
amendment,
to
limit
it
to
that
on
the
one
hand.
and
on
the
other
hand,
tends
to
expand
it
to
a
vaguely
indefinite
field
where
nobody
knows
what
it's
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
cannot
accomplish
it
on
the
basis
of
the
court's
holding.
the
court
held,
as
i
understand
it,
maybe
i'm
wrong,
it's
the
reason
i
asked
you
the
question,
as
i
understand
it,
what
it
held
was
this.
here's
a
subpoena
issued
to
bring
the
paper.
if
you
don't
bring
them
you
can
be
prosecuted.
the
court
held
that
since
the
subpoena
was
bad,
it
violated
his
rights.
now,
why
would
not
that
same
reasoning
apply
to
this
subpoena?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
the
holding
was
the
other,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
(voice
overlap)
--
before
you
--
just
to
add
to
what
you've
answered
to
justice
white.
suppose
they'd
thrown
out
a
warrant
for
a
man,
a
search
warrant
for
stealing,
having
stolen
goods
in
his
possession
and
as
mr.
justice
white
said,
they
don't
execute
it
but
there
he
is
--
could
that
--
is
that
man
--
does
he
have
a
right
to
sue
this
man
for
issuing
such
a
--
causing
such
a
warrant
to
be
issued
against
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
arrest,
yes,
just
for
the
issuance.
the
sheriff
decides,
i'm
not
going
to
serve
this
thing.
i
don't
like
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
cases?
have
you
looked
up
the
point
that
was
--
that
in
connection
with
state
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
basing
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
your
case
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
basing
your
case
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
are,
you
probably
will
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
have
to
make
a
full
argument
you've
made
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
provision
of
the
constitution
says
arbitrarily
and
capricious?
i
thought
you're
on
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
it
is,
is
a
deprivation
of
that
due
process,
isn't
it
if
it
violates
the
fourth
amendment
in
order
to
make
the
arrest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
to
make
this
--
serve
the
subpoena
--
