william
j.
brennan,

oh,
would
you
have
a
--
would
you
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
employee.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
while
a
federal
employee,
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
acted
outside
the
scope
of
his
authority?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
you're
relying
on
--
what
suit
is
the
civil
rule,
12
or
something
rather,
isn't
it?
that
permits,
what,
dismissal
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
you
are
relying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
is
this
--
on
the
theory
of
waiver
or
something
or
because
he
responded
to
the
subpoena
and
showed
up,
what
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
waive
it
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
fourth
amendment
also
talks
about
arresting
the
person,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
fourth
amendment
certainly
doesn't
deal
only
with
seizing
papers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
saying
that
he
has
a
state
remedy
but
no
federal
remedy
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
this
allegation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
a
diversity
of
[inaudible]
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wirin,
has
it
[inaudible]
on
this,
any
violation
of
the
civil
rights
act
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
reason
for
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
only
applies
to
state
action
(voice
overlap)
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
â€“
[inaudible]
on
the
ground
that
any
federal
claim
stated
is
so
insubstantial
and
frivolous
that
it
does
not
state
a
cause
of
action.
isn't
that
rather
what
the
government's
position
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
they
were
relying
--
i
thought
they
were
saying
the
fact
that
under
bell
and
hood,
you've
got
two
things.
you've
got
jurisdiction
and
cause
of
action
and
if
you
rest
it
on
the
constitution,
you
state
jurisdictional
right
but
no
cause
of
action
unless
the
federal
constitutional
claim
is
substantial
and
non-frivolous?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
arbitrarily,
only
because
it
was
an
excess
of
authority
to
issue,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
in
respect
to
relation
there
has
been
--
in
respect
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
has
it
been
not
for
the
due
process?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
went
beyond
the
privilege?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
it
--
