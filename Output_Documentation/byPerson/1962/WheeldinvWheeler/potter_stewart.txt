justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
there's
any
issue
between
these
two,
the
jurisdiction
and
the
federal
court
as
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
need
any
if
the
other
side
agrees
with
you.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
isn't
that
true
--
justice
potter
stewart
every
subpoena
issued
by
every
court
in
the
land
and
they're
(inaudible)
--
issued
by
the
thousands
everyday,
affects
to
some
extent
the
liberty
of
those
upon
whom
those
subpoenas
are
served.
justice
potter
stewart
because
if
they
have
to
go
to
court,
instead
of
going
to
work
that
day
or
instead
of
going
to
the
ball
game.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
arrest
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
arrest
was
there
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
think
you
were.
justice
potter
stewart
haven't
you
--
haven't
you
right
there
put
your
finger
on
the
big
distinction
between
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
and
a
subpoena
to
appear
and
testify
ad
testificandum.
in
boyd
against
the
united
states
which
relied
as
you
rightly
say
on
both
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
amendments
and
which
involved
a
subpoena
to
bring
a
lot
of
papers
and
records.
it
was
necessary
right
at
that
point
in
order
to
assert
the
witnesses'
rights
under
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
to
resist
that
subpoena
because
those
records,
once
they
were
in
the
hands
of
the
opposite
party
or
in
the
court,
could
not
stand
up
and
say,
“i
rely
on
my
privilege
under
the
first
amendment.
i
rely
under
--
on
my
privilege
right
under
the
fifth
amendment.”
to
them,
it
would've
been
done,
but
a
live
witness,
not
compelled
to
bring
anything
with
him
but
only
to
come
there
himself
can
come
there
with
all
his
constitutional
rights
intact
and
those
can
be
tested
if
as
it
when
he
asserts
them
in
answer
to
any
interrogation
that
may
be
addressed
to
him.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
the
difference?
justice
potter
stewart
all
that's
left
is
damages,
am
i
right?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
little
more
than
that.
it's
whether
a
trial
--
whether
or
not
a
claim
has
been
stated
under
the
constitution
or
law
of
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
all
right
this
is
a
--
the
ruling
here
was
that
a
claim
under
the
constitution
or
of
the
united
states
or
a
law
of
the
united
states
hadn't
been
stated.
there
is
no
ruling
that
a
claim
had
been
stated
under
some
federal
or
under
some
state
statutory
or
common
law,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
no
longer
the
issue
as
to
both
of
you
now
also.
