mr.

is
your
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
case
of
wheeldin
before
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
i
understand
mr.
wirin
that
the
government
admits
that
this
was
an
invalid
subpoena?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rosenthal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
your
case
would
be
no
different
if
he
had
appeared
before
the
committee.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
i
want
to
get
clear
in
my
mind
is
if
you
--
you
were
giving
us
the
history
mr.
rosenthal
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
you
said
that
the
mere
service
of
a
subpoena
would
never
contemplate
it
by
the
--
those
who
drafted
the
amendment.
now,
could
you
say
exactly
the
same
thing
if
he
had
appeared
and
testified?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
--
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wirin.
