mr.
a.
l.
wirin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
raised
by
the
instant
petition
as
the
petitioners
view
it
are
two.
first,
whether
or
not,
the
district
court,
and
i
say
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california,
had
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
the
issues
raised
by
a
suit
filed
in
that
court
and
secondly,
whether
or
not,
the
complaint
states
a
cause
of
action
warranting
relief
or
requiring
the
trial
on
the
merits.
the
complaint
which
i
can
summarize
very
quickly
is
in
behalf
of
two
persons,
both
of
whom
were
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities.
the
defendant
below,
the
respondent
here,
is
an
agent
of
that
committee,
is
the
investigator
for
that
committee
in
california
and
the
complaint
recites
in
effect
that
the
respondent
secured
or
issued
subpoenas
against
the
petitioners
for
the
purpose
of
harassing
them
and
that
particularly
with
respect
to
the
petitioner
admiral
dawson.
and
i
may
say
the
only
public
official
in
this
case
is
the
respondent,
wheeler,
the
petitioner,
admiral
dawson
is
not
a
public
official.
he
is
--
the
admiral
is
merely
his
first
name.
be
that
as
it
may,
with
respect
to
that
petitioner
that
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
respondent,
wheeler,
arranged
for
the
process
to
be
served
at
admiral
dawsonâ€™s
place
of
employment
with
the
intention
that
such
service
would
result
in
a
loss
of
employment
and
that
as
a
result
of
such
service
at
that
place
and
for
that
purpose
in
actual
fact,
admiral
dawson
did
lose
his
employment
through
this
damage
of
course.
the
complaint
as
filed
in
the
district
court
sought
both
equitable
and
relief,
and
relief
at
law.
it
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
the
validity
of
the
subpoena
and
additionally
sought
damages
on
--
because
of
the
manner
of
the
service
of
the
subpoena
and
the
nature
of
the
subpoena.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no.
well,
let
me
come.
i
--
i'll
answer
your
honor's
question
right
now
that
i
had
intended
to
do
so
in
a
moment.
the
petitioners,
or
the
petitioner
wheeldin,
has
determined
to
withdraw
his
petition
with
a
certiorari
and
asked
leave
of
court
to
do
so
and
has
so
stated
in
the
preliminary
statement
in
the
reply
brief.
we
have
done
that
because
we
feel
that
the
damages
to
the
petitioner,
wheeldin,
are
not
substantial.
the
jurisdictional
statute
requires
damages
in
a
sum
of
$10,000
and
also
there
are
some
problems
in
res
judicata
which
is
raised
by
the
government
which
we
think
unnecessarily
obfuscate
or
deviate
the
central
issues
so
that,
if
your
honor's
grant
a
leave
of
court
to
the
petitioner,
wheeldin,
to
withdraw
his
petition,
the
only
petitioner
remaining
is
the
petitioner,
dawson,
and
the
only
matters
which
are
at
issue
pertain
to
the
petitioner,
dawson.
and
i
shall
address
myself,
my
oral
argument
exclusively
to
the
issues
as
raised
in
the
complaint
in
connection
with
the
petitioner,
dawson.
now,
i
brief
--
further
word
by
way
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
history
of
the
--
of
the
proceedings
below
because
that
would,
which
i
will
now
state,
will
--
i
think,
tell
some
light
upon
the
import
of
certain
concessions
made
by
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief,
concessions
which
are
to
the
petitioner
of
a
considerable
consequence.
when
the
suit
was
first
filed,
the
respondent
through
a
licensed
attorney
and
special
counsel
retained
for
the
respondent
by
the
congress,
by
the
house
representatives,
urged
that
the
court
have
no
jurisdiction.
the
trial
court
agreed
with
that
view,
but
upon
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
judgment
and
took
the
view
that
there
was
jurisdiction
in
the
trial
court.
from
that
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
first
decision
that
government
took
no
--
sought
no
review
in
this
court.
in
any
event,
at
the
second
round,
when
the
matter
was
remanded
to
the
trial
court,
the
government
then
took
the
view
that
the
complaint
didn't
state
a
cause
of
action.
the
trial
court
sustained
that
position
granting
a
motion
to
dismiss.
and
that
position
was
posited
on
the
claim
that
the
respondent
wheeldin,
was
--
had
complete,
absolute
immunity
from
liability
under
barr
versus
matteo,
the
decision
of
this
court
that
a
public
official
in
some
circumstances
when
he
commits
an
alleged
libel,
he's
absolutely
privileged.
before
the
court
of
appeals,
the
sole
basis
for
the
government's
contention
was
the
claim
of
absolute
immunity
and
the
sole
basis
for
the
cause
of
ruling
was
absolute
immunity.
in
this
court,
however,
and
this
is
what
i'm
getting
to
now,
with
respect
to
the
petitioner,
dawson,
the
government
recedes
from
that
contention
made
in
the
courts
below
upon
which
the
courts
below
rendered
its
judgment.
and
it
concedes
that
as
to
the
petitioner,
dawson,
the
--
to
the
respondent,
wheeldin
has
no
absolute
immunity
that
the
complaint
alleges
--
now,
i'm
stating
my
own
view
of
the
matter,
that
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
respondent,
wheeler,
secured
subpoenas
without
the
knowledge
of
the
chairman
of
the
committee
or
so
far
as
the
complainant
is
concerned,
without
the
knowledge
or
approval
of
any
member
of
the
committee.
and
i
state
to
your
honors
now,
so
that
your
honors
will
understand
what
i'm
saying
at
--
state
in
the
context.
the
applicable
federal
statute
is
a
resolution
by
the
congress
which
is
now
designated
by
the
house
as
rule
ix,
which
authorized
--
which
of
course
is
set
forth
in
the
--
in
our
briefs,
that
resolution
authorizes
the
committee
to
hold
hearings
and
with
respect
to
the
issue
in
subpoenas,
expressly
provides
that
only
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
or
the
chairman
of
a
subcommittee,
or
a
member
of
congress
who
was
the
chair
--
who
is
a
member
of
either
of
this
committees
especially
designated
by
the
chairman
of
either
committee
may
issue
subpoena.
and
so,
the
government
in
this
case,
on
the
merits,
concedes
that
the
defendant,
wheeler,
as
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
that
is
all
there
is
before
this
court
for
the
trial
court
sustained
a
motion
to
dismiss,
that
the
defendant,
wheeler,
exceeded
his
authority
and
acted
beyond
his
statutory
powers.
and
in
effect
--
now,
i'm
just
paraphrasing
it
and
using
my
own
understanding
of
it,
the
solicitor
general
will
of
course
explain
the
position
of
the
government.
in
effect,
the
government
concedes,
as
we
view
it,
liability
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
wheeler,
but
urges
that
--
that
libel
should
be
determined
in
the
state
court
rather
than
the
federal
court
on
the
ground
that
there
is
no
federal
claim
stated.
now,
one
further
--
one
further
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
we
concede
it
as
a
cause
of
action
arising
solely
and
entirely
under
federal
law,
having
no
basis
in
or
rooted
in
any
state
law
and
for
the
following
three
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
we
say
that
it
arises
under
a
law
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
certainly
within
the
concepts
announced
just
recently
by
this
court
in
a
unanimous
decision
written
by
justice
white
a
week
ago
or
yesterday.
first,
because
it's
--
the
cause
of
action
stems
from
the
--
a
law
of
congress
namely,
the
resolution
of
a
house,
namely
rule
xi,
under
which
this
committees
function.
and
we
say
that
probably
construed
that
statute,
barred
the
respondent
wheeler
from
issuing
a
subpoena
without
any
authorization
or
without
any
knowledge
of
any
member
of
the
--
of
the
committee.
and
that
impliedly
the
statute
having
imposed
an
obli
--
an
obligation
upon
the
respondent
not
to
issue
a
subpoena,
conferred
a
right
upon
the
petitioner
to
be
free
from
that
kind
of
the
exercise
of
excessive
authority
by
an
agent
of
the
committee,
but
more
than
that,
we
say
that
the
cause
of
action
arises
under
the
constitution
of
united
states.
i
already
talked
about
the
law
of
united
states,
the
jurisdictional
statute,
your
honor,
section
1331,
28
u.s.
code,
conferred
jurisdiction
upon
the
federal
courts
where
a
claim
arises
either
out
of
the
law
or
out
of
the
constitution.
and
with
respect
to
the
matter--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
we
rely
primarily
upon
the
fourth,
but
also
upon
the
fifth
and
the
reasons
for
our
reliance
upon
the
fourth
but
that
--
of
the
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
due
process
clause.
first,
with
respect
to
the
fourth,
which
of
course
is
a
broad
guarantee
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
the
government
makes
the
argument
here
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
directed
exclusively
against
the
use
of
the
securing
of
evidence
or
seizure
through
physical
force
only.
and
we
agree,
of
course,
that
the
service
of
the
subpoena
per
se
is
not
the
exercise
of
physical
force
similar
to
the
seizure
of
a
person
through
his
imprisonment,
or
the
seizure
of
books
and
papers
which
are
the
result
of
the
--
of
the
search
of
man's
defects.
on
the
other
hand,
this
court
to
--
seems
to
us
has
clearly
decided
generations
ago,
in
boyd
versus
united
states,
and
as
recently
reaffirmed
the
view
that
a
subpoena
duces
tecum,
which
is
too
broad
in
its
scope
violates
the
guarantees
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
issuance
and
service
of
it.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
all
and
that
a
person
who
claims
that
the
subpoena
on
its
face
is
too
broad,
may
challenge
the
subpoena
and
tell
me
successfully,
if
you
convince
--
you
can
convince
the
court
it's
too
broad,
merely
because
of
the
issuance
of
a
subpoena
on
the
ground
that
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
on
itself
prior
to
the
actual
seizure
of
the
records
which
are
the
subject
matter
of
the
subpoena
is
too
broad.
so
that
we
think
your
honors
have
not
extended,
but
have
recognized
the
principle
that
a
broad
subpoena
may
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
duces
tecum,
yes.
now
a
subpoena
not
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
this
is
the
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
was
not.
it
was
the
plain
subpoena,
subpoena
against
[inaudible]
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
admits
that
the
respondent
exceeded
his
authority
in
securing
the
subpoena
in
the
manner
set
forth
in
the
complaint,
and
it
so
admits
it,
in
its
brief
on
page
--
on
pages
31
and
32.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
so
--
yes,
it
did.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
indeed.
i
misstated
myself.
what
i
meant
was,
that
the
matter
being
before
your
honors
upon
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
where
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
are
deemed
to
be
--
deemed
to
be
true
for
the
purposes
of
the
motion
to
dismiss.
that's
all
i
meant,
of
course.
the
government
doesn't
concede
the
matter
on
the
merits.
and
indeed
i
--
all
our
--
all
we
desire
is
if
we're
successful
or
if
we're
lucky
is
a
ruling
from
this
court
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
trial
and
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
prove
the
allegations
in
the
complaint.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
precisely.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
think
it
makes
a
difference
so
far
as
the
petitioner's
case
is
concerned.
i
think
also
to
answer
your
honor's
question
a
little
bit
more
directly,
i
would
view
it
that
a
person
who
is
a
public
official
clothed
with
authority
and
there
is
no
question
the
respondent
was
that
and
represents
one
of
the
great
agencies
of
the
government,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
agree
with
that
--
with
that
interpretation
of
the
complaint
--
about
the
complaint.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
don't
always
agree
with
government
but
i
do
when
a
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
oh,
all
right.
now,
let
me
just
--
i
think
i
have
nothing
to
answer
your
honor's
question.
now,
i
admit
that
i
had
to
do
so.
so
far
as
liability
is
concerned
--
i
--
there
would
be
no
difference
in
view
of
the
government's
statement
whether
he
was
a
pri
--
or
just
a
person
acting
as
one
who
try
to
commit
a
joke
or
was
acting
seriously
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
--
but
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
precisely,
precisely.
but
if
he
were
not
acting
under
color
of
authority,
and
if
he
were
not
undertaking
to
act
for
the
committee
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
we're
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
exactly.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
precisely.
and
it's
because
of
that--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
don't
want
to
go
that
far.
[laughter]
i
don't
want
to
go
that
far
but
--
but
i
think
it's
clear,
both
from
the
allegations
in
the
--
in
the
complaint
and
from
the
--
and
from
the
contentions
of
the
parties
in
this
case,
that
the
respondent
at
all
times
was
a
person
in
the
employee
of
the
congress
and
undertook
to
act
before
the
congress
and
was
acting
under
color
of
authority
and
the
petitioners
make
no
contention
or
suggestion
to
the
contrary.
and
so
in
short,
we
say,
because
of
that
--
that
the
state
court,
that
the
federal
court
had
jurisdiction
that
the
matter
is
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
at
all,
and
even
if
it
were
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
and
had
been
filed
in
the
state
court,
the
government
would
have
a
right
under
the
removal
statute
to
remove
it
to
the
federal
court
where
the
issues
would
be
tried
and
--
but
we
say
that
the
court,
district
court
had
(a)
jurisdiction
and
(b)
should
have
denied
the
motion
to
dismiss
so
that
the
case
could
be
tried
in
the
federal
court
on
the
merits
to
adjudicate
it,
the
controverted
issues
of
fact.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
none
at
all.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
i
think
the
civil
rights
act
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
the
civil
rights
act
probably
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
conduct
by
state
officers
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
that
this
is
a
conduct
by
a
federal
official.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
now,
i
dissent
from
the
views
of
the
solicitor
general's
office
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
arise
under
law
or
constitution,
and
the
suggestion
made
that
in
order
for
a
federal
court
to
have
jurisdiction,
in
order
for
a
matter
to
arise
under
a
law
or
the
constitution,
the
law
or
constitution
must
expressly
confer
a
specific
right.
this
court
explored
this
entire
matter
in
international
association
of
machinists
versus
central
airlines
a
week
ago
yesterday.
and
in
that
case,
what
was
involved
was
a
contract
presumably
made
under
--
under
state
law,
but
stemming
from
obligations
which
arose
out
of
federal
law
and
this
court
took
the
view
that
the
federal
court
had
jurisdiction.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
think
perhaps
there
isn't,
but
what
i
really
ought
to
go
on
to
say
is
that
not
only
is
there
jurisdiction
but
in
such
circumstances
then
there
is
a
statement
of
a
cause
of
action
invoking
a
federal
claim.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
if
so,
there
would
be
--
if
so,
the
motion
to
dismiss
which
was
sustained
here
because
the
complaint
doesn't
state
the
claim,
i
suppose
presumably
doesn't
say
the
federal
claim
was
improvidently
granted.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
now,
we
say
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
if
we
have
two
strings
to
our
bow,
could
be
--
maybe
a
little
better
off
than
just
one.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
but
you
see,
their
agreement
with
us,
your
honor,
to
be
candid,
is
nominal
rather
than
substantive
because
they
concede
there
was
jurisdiction
and
then
they
proceed
to
argue
that
there
is
no
cause
of
action
stated
because
no
federal
claim
is
stated.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
if
they
--
if
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
alright,
now
let
me
address
myself
to
that
summarily,
and
also
say
something
that
i
neglected
to
say
in
my
opening
argument
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
well
as
the
fourth
amendment,
we're
trying
three
strings
rather
than
two.
we
say
that
in
addition
to
there
being
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fifth
because
the
process
here
was
issued
arbitrarily
and
hence
not
in
the
accordance
to
due
process
of
law
that
it
affects
the
petitioner's
liberty
because
it's
compulsory
process
which
compels
this
petitioner
to
go
to
some
place
and
be
there
at
a
certain
time
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
right.
and
therefore
we
say
that
a
process
which
issues
arbitrarily
violates
due
process
of
law,
and
if
it
affects
liberty
by
some
restriction
of
liberty
that
it's
a
separation
of
liberty
without
due
process
of
law
in
violation
of
the
fifth.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
with
these
three,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
every
such
subpoena
would
not
abridge
liberty
without
due
process
of
law
unless
if
it
were
issued
arbitrarily.
and
if
it
is
issued
arbitrarily,
we
would
say,
and
if
it
was
federal
process,
we
would
say
that
it
is
a
matter
which
should
be
adjudicated
to
the
validity
of
the
process,
should
be
adjudicated
by
the
federal
courts.
and
that
leads
me
then
to
what
i
want
to
say
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
would
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
probably
that's
the
import
of
--
that's
the
inescapable
effect
of
my
argument.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i'm
not
too
sure
now.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
pardon?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no,
not
at
all
because
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
because
of
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
no,
i'm
not
basing
my
case.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
all
i'm
saying
is,
i
think
we
also
have
a
due
process.
deprivation
of
liberty
without
due
process
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
in
that
connection
what
i
want
to
say
is
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
have
to
go
a
little
farther
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
am
not
contending
there
was
any
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i'm
not
contending
to
what
arrest.
but
i
am
saying
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
alright.
a
subpoena
is
a
form
of
compulsory
process.
it
requires
a
person
to
do
that
which
otherwise
he's
under
no
requirement
to
do,
and
to
do
it
on
pain
of
prosecution
and
to
that
extent
it's
a
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
is
not
serious
violation.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
as
a
matter
of
fact,
counsel
was
incorrect
about
that
in
two
respects.
he's
talking
about
a
different
man.
he's
talking
about
wheeldin,
not
dawson.
as
a
matter
if
dawson
did
show
up.
to
be
sure,
we
don't
say
it
in
our
complaint,
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
say
it.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
the
complaint
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
complaint
said
nothing
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
the
complaint
says
nothing
about
that
one
way
or
the
other.
and
what
i
was
tying
--
what
i
want
to
say
is
that
i
think
boyd
versus
united
states
decides
and
i
think
this
court
has
either
decided
or
has
been
committed
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
the
dividing
language
in
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
is
a
fine
complaint
that
both
the
fourth
and
the
fifth,
we're
talking
about
due
process,
are
designed
to
protect
as
boyd
versus
united
states
says,
the
security
of
the
person
and
his
effect.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
your
honor,
i
think
you've
--
if
your
honor
will
look
again
at
boyd
versus
united
states
in
116
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
didn't
discuss
the
privilege
at
all.
it
was
discussing
merely
the
securing
of
evidence
from
a
person
against
him
through
compulsory
process
by
the
government.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
there
through
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
your
honor
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
is
quite
right
and
i
agree
with
you
entirely
but
let
us
take
your
example
one
step
further.
suppose
the
person
who
was
subpoenaed
in
boyd
versus
united
states
have
sued
for
damages.
he
would
say,
my
--
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
and
i
am
fitting
a
federal
claim
because
my
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
have
been
taken
away.
now
in
--
what
we're
saying
is
that
when
a
person
is
served
with
a
subpoena
whether
duces
tecum
or
ad
testificandum,
at
least
his
liberty
has
been
affected
to
the
[inaudible]
and
if
it
injures
him
seriously
as
it
did
as
to
petitioner,
dawson,
we
say,
at
least
he
may
go
to
the
federal
court
and
secure
relief.
now
in
this
case,
the
original
suit
sought
declaratory
judgment
that
the
subpoena
was
invalid,
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
subpoena
with
respect
to
which
the
state
courts
of
california
couldn't
possibly
have
any
jurisdiction
and
it
also
sought
damages.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
all
that
is
left
is
damages
and
all
that
we
are
saying
is
--
and
the
narrow
question
which
finally
results
from
this
discussion
about
the
broad
constitutional
principle
which
are
in
this
case
is
the
narrow
question
as
to
whether
the
plaintiff
--
the
petitioner
is
in
the
right
hall
and
we
say
he
is
in
the
federal
court
correctly.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
and
may
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
and
may
in
addition
violate
a
statute
here,
rule
9
(a).
now
finally,
i
am
also
saying
this
that
the
government's
present
concession
that
we
can
sue
this
respondent
in
the
state
court
comes
pretty
late
to
help
the
petitioner
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
the
statute
of
--
california
statute
of
limitations
has
long
since
come
and
gone,
but
more
seriously,
this
court
has
said
that
a
denial
of
a
motion
to
--
the
denial
--
the
granting
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
a
cause
of
action
is
not
stated
is
an
adjudication
on
the
merits.
and
so
even
if
we
could
file
a
suit
in
the
state
courts
in
california,
we
will
be
met
by
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
on
the
ground
that
there
has
been
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
of
the
claim,
and
indeed,
mr.
justice
black,
in
bell
versus
hood,
the
chief
case
on
this
subject
said
that
a
ruling,
granting
a
motion
to
dismiss
because
a
claim
is
misstated
is
not
a
ruling
and
that
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
that's
allowing
another
court
with
extra
jurisdiction,
but
is
a
ruling
on
the
merits.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
ruling
by
the
court
--
united
states
court
of
appeals
which
your
honors
are
reviewing
was
directly
to
the
effect
that
the
plaintiff
--
that
petitioner
had
no
right
to
relief
because
the
defendant
had
it
complete
and
asked
for
the
immunity,
no.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
if
that
is
--
that's
the
law
in
which
we
proceed
with
the
issue.
now
finally,
let
me
say
these
things.
we
think
that
sound
judicial
policy,
but
first,
by
congressional
and
federal
executive
policy
calls
for
this
kind
of
a
case
to
be
tried
on
the
merits
by
a
federal
court
rather
than
by
a
state
court
for
these
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
the
congress
has
indicated
a
policy
that
suits
against
federal
officials
be
tried
in
the
federal
courts
by
providing
peremptorily
in
the
removal
statute
that
a
federal
official
sue
as
this
federal
official
is
may
summarily
cause
the
matter
to
be
removed
to
the
federal
court
where
he
has
acted
under
color
of
authority.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i'm
merely
drawing
the
comfort
that
at
least
in
that
respect
the
congress
intended
that
in
that
situation,
a
federal
tribunal
is
a
proper
tribunal.
i'm
going
to
say
that
in
addition
to
that,
the
department
of
justice,
and
we
set
forth
in
an
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
the
policy
of
the
department
of
justice
of
removal
of
cases
to
the
federal
courts.
and
we
think
it
would
be
improvident
and
might
even
be
unfair
to
public
officials
if
their
conduct
was
to
be
tried
in
a
state
court
as
subject
to
the
vagaries
of
state
court
decisions
and
it
could
lead
to
a
more
uniform
and
more
acceptable
administration
of
justice
where
the
citizen
claims
a
federal
official
has
deprived
him
of
his
rights
if
the
federal
district
courts
were
to
adjudicate
those
controversies.
