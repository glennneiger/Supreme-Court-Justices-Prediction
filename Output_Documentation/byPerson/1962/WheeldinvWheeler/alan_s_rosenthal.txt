mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
wirin
has
indicated,
in
this
case,
the
petitioner,
dawson,
sought
to
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
district
court
to
recover
damages
from
the
respondent
an
employee
of
the
congress
for
an
alleged
violation
by
respondent
of
certain
constitutional
rights
of
the
petitioner,
basically,
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
we
think
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
at
the
outset
that
the
conduct
complained
of
amounted
to
nothing
more
than
the
issuance,
purportedly
unauthorized
issuance,
by
the
respondent
of
a
subpoena
ad
testificandum,
directing
that
the
petitioner
appear
at
a
hearing
of
the
committee
of
the
congress
and
give
unprivileged
testimony.
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
by
the
petitioner,
nor
could
there
be,
of
any
action
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
beyond
the
mere
issuance
of
this
assertedly
unauthorized
subpoena,
or
for
that
matter
of
any
action
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
in
response
to
the
subpoena.
dawson,
not
only
did
not
testify,
but
he
did
not
even
appear
at
the
committee's
hearings.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
because
your
honor,
there's
no
allegation
in
this
complaint
that
there
was
any
appearance
or
any
action
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
in
response
to
the
subpoena.
we've
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
there
is
an
allegation
of
economic
loss.
of
course,
i
would
stress
to
your
honor
that
the
question
as
to
whether
there's
been
an
infringement
of
a
constitutional
right
is
determined
in
the
first
instance
by
the
conduct
which
is
charged,
not
by
the
fact
that
there
may
or
may
not
be
economic
injury.
there
are
a
lot
of
--
there's
a
lot
of
torturous
conduct
which
results
in
injury,
which
by
no
stretch
to
the
imagination
could
be
regarded
as
involving
an
infringement
of
the
constitutional
right.
in
this
case,
we
submit,
in
view
of
the
allegations
of
this
complaint,
the
petitioner's
constitutional
claim
is
wholly
insubstantial.
now,
i
would
like
at
this
point
to
correct
one
statement
which
mr.
wirin
made.
the
argument
which
we
are
advancing
in
this
court
was
advanced
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
argument
that
the
constitutional
claim
was
insubstantial.
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
sure,
decided
it
not
on
that
ground
but
on
the
ground
of
the
applicability
of
barr
against
matteo
which
as
mr.
wirin
correctly
points
out,
the
government
does
not
rely
on
with
respect
to
the
one
remaining
petitioner
in
this
case
in
this
court.
it
would
be
pointless
--
most
certainly
may
in
the
brief
which
was
filed
below
on
behalf
of
the
respondent.
now,
we
say
that
this
constitutional
claim
is
wholly
insubstantial
because
even
if
it
were
to
be
assumed
that
there
is
a
right
to
damages
for
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
this
was
the
question
which
this
court
left
open
in
bell
against
hood,
we
think
that
the
amendment
cannot
possibly
be
read
as
granting
protection
against
being
required
to
appear
and
give
testimony
to
a
legislative,
judicial
or
administrative
body,
or
granting
a
claim
to
one
who
in
fact,
some
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
neither
testified
nor
appeared.
now,
notwithstanding
this
insubstantiality,
we
do
not
urge
that
the
district
court
was
without
jurisdiction
to
entertain
petitioner's
complaint
under
28
u.s.c.
1331.
as
we
read
this
court's
decision
in
bell
against
hood,
it
is
of
no
moment
in
the
resolution
of
the
jurisdictional
issue
that
the
complaint
does
not
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted
under
the
constitutional
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
court
held
that
whether
or
not
a
valid
cause
of
action
is
stated
where
the
complaint
is
drawn
as
it
is
here,
as
to
seek
recovery
directly
under
the
constitutional
laws
of
the
united
states,
the
federal
court
must
entertain
the
suit.
now,
there
was
some
indication
in
bell
against
hood
that
there
might
be
an
exception
where
the
alleged
constitutional
claim
is
either
clearly
immaterial
or
wholly
insubstantial.
but
the
court
went
on
to
suggesting
bell
and
again
in
baker
against
carr
that
it
is
doubtful
at
dismissals
on
these
grounds,
but
insubstantiality,
it
could
properly
be
considered
as
jurisdiction.
and
as
for
this
reason,
again,
we
do
not
in
response
to
the
question
which
the
court
posed
at
the
time
that
it
granted
certiorari,
we
do
not
urge
that
the
district
court
was
without
jurisdiction.
rather
we
suggest
that
the
complaint
was
appropriately
dismissed
for
the
failure
to
state
illegally
cognizable
claim.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
but
as
long
as
his
complaint
is
drafted
so
as
to
be
based,
you
see,
the
right
to
recover
to
be
based
upon
the
constitution
or
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
there
is
federal
jurisdiction
irrespective
of
how
insubstantial
the
claim
may
be.
at
least,
this
is
the
way
that
we
read
bell
against
hood
and
the
way
indeed
that
the
ninth
circuit
read
it.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
in
this
case,
for
the
fairness
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted
in
an
action
in
a
federal
district
court
where
jurisdiction
rested
necessarily
upon
section
1331
of
the
judicial
code.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
fail
to
state
a
claim
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
or
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
correct.
whether
it's
a
state
--
cause
of
action
or
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
yes,
i
think
so.
i
think
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
correct.
now,
we
submit
if
the
court
pleases,
that
insofar
as
the
claim
is
asserted
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that
we
think
that
the
history
of
the
amendment,
its
terms
and
its
interpretation
by
this
court,
all
compel
the
conclusion
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
reach
the
issuance
of
a
subpoena
ad
testificandum.
with
respect
to
the
history
of
this
amendment,
the
background
of
the
fourth
amendment
has
many
times
been
discussed
by
this
court
as
recently
as
in
frank
against
maryland.
as
the
court
has
noted,
the
fourth
amendment
had
it's
genesis
in
the
infamous
general
arrest
and
search
warrants
which
were
prevalent
in
great
britain
in
the
18th
century.
and
their
colonial
counterpart,
the
general
writs
of
assistance
which
were
employed
principally
in
the
colony
of
massachusetts
bay
for
the
purpose
of
the
enforcement
of
the
revenue
laws.
now,
as
it
was
made
clear
in
both
lord
camden's
opinion
in
entick
against
carrington
which
this
court
has
many
times
referred
and
which
held
that
the
english
warrants
were
invalid
and
the
famous
argument
of
james
otis
against
the
colonial
writs
of
assistance,
the
fundamental
vice
there
involved
to
which
the
fourth
amendment
was
directed
was
the
denial
of
two
essential
liberties.
the
first
of
these
liberties
was
the
right
of
privacy
in
one's
home,
one's
possessions
and
one's
papers.
the
second
was
the
denial
of
the
freedom
from
preemptory
arrest
and
detention
without
probable
cause.
and
both
the
english
general
search
warrants
and
the
colonial
writs
of
assistance
offended
one
or
both
of
these
essential
rights.
the
--
of
the
first
american
precedence
of
a
constitutional
character
for
the
fourth
amendment
was
the
virginia
bill
of
rights
of
1776.
both
its
article
10
which
condemn
general
search
and
arrest
warrants
oblivious
in
the
press
and
the
like
constitutional
provisions
which
were
adopted
in
six
other
states
in
the
period
between
1776
and
1784
reflected
against
a
concern
only
for
the
privacy
in
one's
residence
and
possessions
for
freedom
from
unreasonable
arrest
and
complaint.
now,
these
we
submit,
are
rights
involving
interests
which
are
markedly
different
and
considerably
more
important
than
those
which
would
be
affected
by
an
unauthorized
order
to
appear
and
testify
at
an
unprivileged
matter.
we
think
that
the
terms
of
the
fourth
amendment
confirmed
that
it
was
not
intended
to
protect
witnesses
from
being
compelled
to
testify.
testimonial
compulsion,
we
submit
plainly
does
not
involve
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
person's,
houses,
papers
and
effects
against
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
similarly,
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena
ad
testificandum
is
by
no
means
an
arrest
or
in
the
terms
of
the
amendment,
the
seizure
of
a
person.
what
the
amendment
protects
against
the
net
context
is
the
immediate
detention
of
the
individual
under
a
forced
--
under
threat
of
force
or
under
the
assertion
of
some
legal
right
to
detain
the
person
at
once
not
the
direction
that
the
person
appear
at
some
future
date
to
give
testimony
before
a
judicial
legislative
or
administrative
tribunal.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
--
well,
we're
dealing
of
course
here
mr.
justice
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
harlan
with
the
merely
issuance
of
the
subpoena
and
that
is
all
that
mr.
wheeler
is
charged
with.
and
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena
directing
the
recipient
to
appear
at
some
future
date
to
give
testimony
before
a
committee
of
the
congress
before
a
judicial
body
that
in
and
of
itself
is
not
immediate
detention
and
it's
never
been
regarded
as
being
an
arrest.
we
refer
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
if
he
appeared
and
refused
to
testify
on
the
basis
of
the
fourth
amendment,
well
then
at
that
point,
since
the
claim
at
least
in
our
view
would
be
entirely
substantially,
would
be
subject
to
that
point
of
arrest.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
your
honor,
because
in
that
instance,
if
he
were
arrested,
he
would
not
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
precisely
your
honor.
on
this
phase
of
our
argument,
we
do
point
out
in
--
another
phase
of
our
argument
is
this
that
even
if
you
could
say
that
the
--
directing
of
somebody
to
appear
to
testify
was
a
search
or
constituted
an
arrest.
in
this
case,
since
the
individual
neither
appeared
nor
testified,
there
would
plainly
be
no
search
or
seizure
even
if
the
terms
had
that
broad
meaning.
that
even
if
again,
even
if
you
were
to
assume
that
the
fourth
amendment
would
reach
this
type
of
subpoena
in
the
absence
of
demands
that
are
actually
responding
to
this
subpoena
appearing
to
give
testimony,
there
plainly
could
be
no
fourth
amendment
violation.
this
is
no
different
we
would
think
as
we've
suggest
in
our
brief
in
the
situation
where
an
officer
with
a
totally
unlawful
search
warrant
were
to
appear
at
a
man's
home
and
demand
admission
and
the
man
was
to
turn
him
away
from
the
door.
in
that
case,
so
we
would
submit,
there
would
be
plainly
no
basis
for
any
action
against
the
officer
because
in
point
of
fact
no
search
or
seizure
took
place.
by
the
same
token
here,
even
if
the
fourth
amendment
applied
to
subpoenas
ad
testificandum
which
it
doesn't
there
would
be
no
claim
stated
under
the
fourth
amendment
because
there
was
no
appearance
and
no
testimony
was
given.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that
is
correct.
the
subpoena
ad
testificandum,
we're
again
only
talking
about
a
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
testifying
subpoena
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
as
it
were.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
now,
this
brings
me,
if
the
court
pleases,
to
this
court's
prior
decisions
in
this
area.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
absolutely
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
would
say,
absolutely
not.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
--
because
in
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
for
the
purpose
of
the
case.
well,
now,
i
think
we've
got
of
course
two
questions.
this
--
the
first
question
is
whether
his
rights
have
been
violated
by
the
individual
who
issued
the
subpoena.
that's
plain
enough
and
we're
assuming
that
he
appears
before
the
congressional
committee
and
he's
asked
these
questions
and
he
stands
on
the
fourth
amendment
and
he
is
then
subject
to
arrest
by
the
committee
itself
or
by
the
--
and
the
arrest
is
presumably
effected
by
united
states
martial.
now
in
that
case,
there
would
be
no
conduct
possibly
on
the
part
of
the
respondent
here
given
that
sequel
to
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena
here
which
could
be
regarded
as
an
invasion
of
any
fourth
amendment
right
on
his
part,
because
the
arrest
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
it
wouldn't
be
the
waiver
but
that
it
would
be
that
the
fourth
amendment
again
is
directed
to
the
protection
of
the
right
of
the
individual
to
be
secure
in
his
person.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
but
his
--
the
lack
of
security
after
he
is
arrested
if
the
court
pleases,
is
not
because
of
any
action
on
the
part
of
the
issuer
of
the
subpoena.
all
that
has
transpired
in
this
case
suppresses
that
the
respondent
issued
this
piece
of
paper
which
directed
him
to
appear.
now,
if
subsequently
he
appears
that
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
when
he
didn't
have
to.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
then
if
he
is
arrested,
if
he
is
arrested
at
this
juncture,
if
there
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
the
violation
is
on
the
part
of
the
people
who
arrested
him.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
is
a
possibility
in
those
circumstances
of
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
pose
mr.
justice
white,
it
--
it
would
seem
to
me
that
his
--
he
would
have
absolutely
no
cause
of
action
because
there
would
be
no
substance
to
his
claim
whether
these
--
that
--
based
upon
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
in
the
area
of
testimonial
compulsion,
this
court
has
established
in
the
series
of
opinions
the
applicability
of
the
fifth
amendment's
protection
against
self-incrimination,
quite
recently
in
naacp
against
alabama,
the
first
amendment's
protection
of
the
right
of
association
and
of
course
it
also
held
sometime
ago
in
the
--
in
kilbourn
against
thompson
that
the
witness
is
immunized
from
testifying
in
circumstances
where
the
congressional
inquiry
does
not
have
a
valid
underlying
legislative
purpose.
but
it's
never
been
suggested
to
my
knowledge,
if
your
honor
pleases,
that
the
testimonial
compulsion
at
any
stage
of
the
procedure
is
subject
to
the
guarantee
of
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
the
fourth
amendment
has
come
in
as
was
noted
earlier
in
connection
with
the
subpoena
duces
tecum.
and
as
mr.
wirin
correctly
points
out,
this
court
has
held
that
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
is
within
the
ambit
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
basis
of
that
holding
was
that
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
can
accomplish
the
substantial
objects
of
a
forcible
entry
into
a
man's
house
and
a
search
of
his
papers.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right.
but
it
was
in
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
at
this
point
your
honor,
if
he
does
not
appear,
he
would
be
at
that
point
subject
to
trial
on
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
his
failure
to
appear
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right
but
he
would
have
it
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
boyd
case,
if
your
honor
pleases,
was
com
--
wholly,
we
submit,
in
the
context
of
the
fact
that
it
is
papers
or
possessions
of
the
individual
which
are
being
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
they're
not
more
important
your
honor
than
the
person
itself.
there
are
protections
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
in
the
--
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
of
relative
importance.
it's
a
--
it
is
a
matter
of
the
--
being
regarded
traditionally,
being
regarded
traditionally
that
a
man
has
this
right
to
privacy
in
his
papers
and
in
his
possessions.
now,
insofar
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
your
honor,
the
--
we
would
submit
that
the
underlying
thought
in
the
fourth
amendment
was
that
of
privacy.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
and
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
it
is
a
man's
--
if
your
honor
pleases,
it
is,
it
seems
to
us
in
effect
certainly
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
addressed
to
the
man's
right
of
privacy
in
his
papers
and
his
possessions.
it
is
that
--
that
you
--
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
we
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
we
--
your
honor
know
--
not
only
know
of
no
such
case
of
that
kind
but
we
know
of
no
such
case
where
it
has
been
suggested
either
in
the
context
of
a
congressional
committee
proceeding,
a
judicial
proceeding
or
an
administrative
proceeding
that
there
is
a
fourth
amendment
right
involved
in
directing
the
man
to
appear
and
give
testimony.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
this
is
the
first
case.
now,
in
the
area
of
congressional
investigations,
the
first
congressional
investigation
took
place
in
1792
when
congress
sought
--
set
up
a
committee
of
seven
of
its
members,
the
house
of
representatives
with
full
power
to
call
persons
and
to
seize
papers
and
that
investigation
was
in
the
connection
with
major
st.
clair's
disastrous
invasion
against
the
indians
in
the
northwest
territory
when
that's
--
since
that
time
as
--
until
this
case
as
of
any
suggestion
that
the
fourth
amendment
has
any
bearing
whatsoever
to
being
called
to
give
testimony
and
we
would
again
submit
that
insofar
as
the
boyd
case
is
concerned
that
it
was
the
fact
that
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
can
accomplish.
the
court
said
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
because,
your
honor,
again,
the
boyd
case
itself
as
your
honor
may
recall
had
discussed
at
some
length
the
background
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
went
through
entick
against
carrington
and
the
landmark
opinions
of
lord
camden
and
also
the
james
otis
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no.
but
it's
holding
there
was
--
again
was,
as
we
read
that
case
what
it
held
was
this
and
that
is
that
what
the
fourth
amendment
was
directed
against
was
someone
breaking
in
under
a
color
authority
into
one
home
and
seizing
his
papers.
and
the
court
said
that
even
though
here,
you
don't
--
you
do
not
have
that
drastic
form
of
governmental
action
that
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
with
this
compulsions
that
attaches
to
it,
directing
the
individual
to
bring
the
papers
or
else
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that's
right,
but
the
--
in
this
case,
again,
that
--
we're
dealing
here
again
with
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena.
now,
we
submit
again
that
it
cannot
possibly,
the
arrest,
the
security
of
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
it
--
the
fourth
amendment
also
says
that
--
it
said
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
person's,
houses,
papers
and
effects
against
the
reasonable
search
and
seizure
shall
not
be
violated
and
that
no
warrant
shall
issue
but
upon
probable
cause
supported
by
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
i
would
say
his
fourth
amendment
rights
might
well
be
violated,
no
sir.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it
does
your
honor
in
terms
of
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
the
fourth
amendment,
if
the
court
pleases,
protects
two
things
in
--
two
in
--
types
of
invasions
of
personal
liberties.
and
one
of
them
is
the
search
and
seizure
part
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
individuals
except
to
the
extent
that
the
individual
may
be
searched
himself
or
his
papers.
the
other
part
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
the
security
of
the
individual
against
what?
against
arrest.
now,
in
the
boyd
case,
they
were
dealing
where
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
just
on
the
issuance
of
the
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
not
for
the
mere
issuance
of
it,
no.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
if
your
honor
pleases,
let
me
make
one
point
quite
clear
at
this
point.
we
are
not
suggesting,
that's
why
i
think
we
make
it
quite
clear
on
our
brief,
that
if
the
facts
are
as
alleged
in
this
complaint,
that
this
individual
would
have
no
right
of
action,
the
petitioner
here
against
the
respondent
that
where
a
federal
official
outside
the
scope
of
his
authority
but
acting
under
the
color
of
law,
invades
an
individual's
rights,
a
from
of
trespass,
from
a
conversion
of
his
property,
and
form
false
arrest
or
false
imprisonment.
he
has
a
common
law
right,
no
question
about
that.
but
we're
dealing
with
here
if
the
court
pleases,
necessarily
since
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
is
wholly
dependent
upon
28
u.s.c
1331.
there
is
no
diversity
jurisdiction
alleged
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
precisely.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
he
might
have.
he
might
have
a
state
remedy
and
in
the
state
remedy,
he
might
--
it
would
be
for
abuse
of
process
if
he
has
one.
the
california
law
of
abuse
of
process
is
somewhat
elusive.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
(voice
overlap)
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
your
honor,
the
--
well,
if
it's
just
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
abuse
of
process
can
take
many
forms.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
and
we
would
be
--
certainly,
the
fourth
amendment
is
designed
to
protect
against
the
--
against
the
issuance
of
either
unwarranted
search
warrants
or
arrest
warrants,
but
there
--
of
course,
process
is
a
much
broader
concept
than
that.
an
abuse
of
process
will
cover
in
addition
such
things
as
the
writs
of
attachments
and
subpoenas.
now,
we
say
that
a
subpoena
ad
testificandum
isn't
within
the
bounds
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
is
plainly,
however,
this
has
been
held
to
be
within
the
bounds
of
the
concept
of
abuse
of
process.
now,
if
again,
that
our
position
is
here
--
is
not
that
necessarily
on
the
allegations
of
this
complaint,
there
is
no
cause
of
action
at
all.
our
position
is
that
there
is
no
federal
cause
of
action
cognizable
in
a
diversity
suit
but
there
is
a
cause
of
action
and
it
is
under
state
law.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
that
connection.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
it's
not
your
honor
and
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
hurdle
that
we
think
that
the
petitioners
cannot
overcome
is
that
the
--
there
is
no
diversity
here
because
it's
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
both
petitioner,
respondent
were
residents
of
california.
and
therefore,
the
claim
has
to
be
based
upon
1331
and
it
doesn't
arise
under
the
constitution.
now,
it
clearly
also
does
not
arise
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
there's
been
some
reference
by
mr.
wirin
of
the
enabling
resolution.
as
this
court
has
held
on
many
occasions,
a
claim
does
not
satisfy
the
jurisdictional
requirement
of
federal
jurisdiction
merely
because
the
course
of
its
decision
will
raise
a
question
under
the
constitution
or
a
federal
statue.
the
claim
must
base
its
right
to
recover
squarely
upon
the
constitution
or
an
act
of
congress.
and
i
think
that
this
court's
examination
of
rule
xi,
will
convince
it
that
the
resolution
cannot
possibly
be
regarded
as
being
a
direct
source
of
a
right
to
money
damages.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it
doesn't
involve
immediate
detention
but
directs
him
merely
to
appear
in
court.
we
would
say
no.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
we
would
say
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
it
--
we
would
say
that's
a
little
closer
obviously
to
the
line
between
arrest
and
not
arresting
in
this
case
but
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
an
opinion
of
justice
cardozo
when
we
was
sitting
on
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
which
indicates
--
reflects,
i
should
think
the
common
law
view
that
arrest
involves
immediate
detention,
not
merely
the
appearance
in
court
at
some
subsequent
day.
but
in
the
case
which
you
hypothesize
mr.
justice
goldberg,
at
least
there
--
the
individuals
being
called
to
answer,
a
criminal
or
quasi
criminal
charge.
in
this
case
is
merely
being
directed
to
do
with
millions
of
people
over
the
years
have
been
directed
to
do
and
that
is
to
respond
to
a
subpoena
to
give
testimony.
