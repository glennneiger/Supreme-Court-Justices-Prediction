what's

that's
all?

duces

justice

but
that
is
also
in
barr
and
matteo
[inaudible]?
justice
byron

white
and
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
agree
with
the
government's
reading
in
the
complaint
that
you
allege
that
this
man
knew
and
should've
known
through
the
proceedings
authority
that
he
had
no
authority
to

how

how

he
knew
he
wasn't
acting
through
a
government's
official
[inaudible]
justice

white
[inaudible]
--
isn't
it
--
if
we
go
too
far
this
brings
us
jurisdiction
--
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
saying
[inaudible]
it's
his
right
not
to
testify
with
the
basis
of
the
fourth
amendment.
is
that
the
same
question
that's
involved
from
--
whether
or
not
the
services
of
warrant
or
service
of
the
subpoena
violates
the
[inaudible]
--
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
--
this
whole
affair
is
illegal,
it's
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
he
won't
answer
a
thing.
then
he's
arrested.
his
fourth
amendment
rights
then
[inaudible]
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
as
to
that
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
for
the
moment
that
you
concede
that
subpoena
in
the
first
place
is
illegal,
[inaudible]
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
i
take
it
if
this
--
for
the
purpose
of
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
isn't
very
secure
after
he's
arrested.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
he
didn't
have
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
he
didn't
have
to
answer
any
questions
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
if
--
but
the
rights
that
has
been
violated
are
his
fourth
amendment
rights.
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
more
important
than
the
person
themselves?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
one
they
--
compelled
him
to
bring
the
document
and
the
other
--
tell
them
to
bring
himself?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
people
arrest
the
person
out
on
the
street
without
probable
cause
and
without
a
warrant,
his
the
fourth
amendment
right
violated
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
really,
the
fourth
amendment
deals
with
persons
and
not
his
papers.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
don't
understand
how
you've
even
came
--
come
closer
in
answer
to
justice
black's
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you'd
say
that
even
if
--
your
first
point
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
--
won't
give
â€“
provide
him
any
protection
in
any
way.
but
even
if
it
did,
it
doesn't
give
a
--
it
doesn't
form
the
basis
for
his
--
in
his
simple
relief.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
wirin
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
there
is
a
--
the
government
does
not
agree
with
you
however
that
there
--
that
the
case
arises
under
a
law.
it
does
agree
with
you
that
it
arises
under
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
don't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
understand
why
in
your
mind
it's
significant
for
you
to
insist
that
there
--
it
arises
under
a
law
as
well
as
under
the
constitution?
