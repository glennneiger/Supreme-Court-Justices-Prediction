mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices
of
this
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
an
order
on
a
divided
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
which
held
constitutional
a
statute
in
a
condemnation
proceeding
and
which
statute
was
attacked
in
this
case
on
the
grounds
that
the
notice
provided
therein
was
inadequate
in
order
to
comply
with
due
process
as
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
for
the
reasons
that
the
time
that
we
have
here
today
is
short,
i
would
like
to
forego
speaking
of
the
procedural
aspects
of
this
case
and
exactly
how
this
case
came
to
this
court
except
merely
to
point
out
that
this
was
an
action
for
an
injunction
brought
by
the
plaintiff
who
was
a
riparian
owner
owning
a
home
on
the
neversink
river.
that
the
city
of
new
york
had
acquired
the
right
to
divert
that
river
in
a
condemnation
proceeding
brought
in
1952
and
that
this
claimant
or
rather
this
plaintiff
here
had
no
knowledge
or
notice
of
this
proceeding
whatsoever
and
brought
this
action
for
an
injunction
in
1959
after
learning
of
the
acquisition
of
her
property
or
portion
of
her
property
by
the
city.
the
motion
made
here
by
the
city
of
new
york
was
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings
and
consequently
all
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
under
new
york
law
since
this
is
a
motion
similar
to
the
common
law
demurrer
should
be
deemed
true.
there
was
a
cross
motion
made
by
the
plaintiff,
the
appellant
here
to
dismiss
the
city's
answer
to
the
complaint.
the
court
of
appeals
as
i've
said
by
a
four-to-two
decision
held
that
the
notice
requirements
of
this
statute
were
adequate.
now,
the
notice
provided
in
this
condemnation
statute
was
notice
that
had
no
personal
service
or
any
effort
at
personal
service
provided
in
it.
the
statute
required
in
addition
to
publication
in
the
city
record
which
is
the
official
publication
of
the
city
of
new
york
and
not
a
newspaper
commonly
read.
it
also
provided
for
notice
in
two
newspapers
published
in
new
york
city.
these
properties
are
of
course
considerable
distances
outside
of
the
territorial
limits
of
new
york
city
and
this
notice
relating
to
city
newspapers,
is
primarily
for
the
information
of
city
officials
and
new
york
city
inhabitants.
in
any
event,
the
appellee
here
has
never
claimed
that
the
notice
in
the
new
york
city
newspapers
was
even
designed
to
calculate
in
any
way
to
give
any
notice
to
the
local
property
owners,
many
of
whom
are
more
than
a
hundred
miles
away
from
new
york
city.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
the
only
purpose
that
i
can
think
of
is
to
give
notice
to
city
officials,
members
of
the
board
of
investment
and
board
water
supply
and
that
--
their
employees,
the
employees
of
the
department
of
water
supply,
gas
and
electricity
and
so
on
--
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
of
the
water
supply
project.
i
don't
know
of
any
other
purpose
that
it
can
serve
your
honor.
in
any
event
--
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
no,
it
does
not.
and
the
city
does
not
even
claim
it
to
be
any
form
of
notice
that
is
significant
insofar
as
property
owners
are
concerned.
the
remaining
notice
is
that
the
notice
of
motion
which
the
city
is
required
to
make
in
order
to
acquire
this
title
be
published
in
two
newspapers
located
in
the
county
in
which
the
property
is
located.
and
the
briefs
here
have
shown
how
the
city
has
deliberately
used
the
lack
of
definiteness
in
the
statute.
the
lack
of
any
requirement
that
these
newspapers
be
those
published
or
having
circulation
in
the
area
of
the
taking.
but
a
--
just
a
general
requirement
that
it'd
be
two
newspapers
in
the
county
and
i
think
the
briefs
have
shown
how
the
city
has
bypassed
those
newspapers
which
were
like
--
would
possibly
be
likely
to
give
notice
in
the
area
of
the
taking
and
has
gone
too
far
into
the
county
to
find
small
newspapers
of
limited
circulation
which
could
not
possibly
be
expected
or
calculated
to
have
any
circulation
whatever
in
the
area
of
the
taking
in
which
to
technically
comply
with
this
inadequate
statute.
there
is
one
other
requirement
for
notice
and
that
is
that
handbills
be
posted
in
20
conspicuous
places
in
the
area
of
the
taking.
there
are
20
places
in
the
vicinity
of
the
taking.
i
think
that
is
the
way
the
statute
reads.
now,
that
has
been
construed
in
this
situation
here
to
constitute
20
notices,
the
city
actually
posted
22
along
a
seven
or
eight
miles
stretch
of
river,
which
would
naturally
mean
14
to
16
miles
of
riverbanks.
and
which
stretch
of
river
had
no
less
than
96
numbered
parcels
shown
on
the
city's
maps.
that
is
20
notices,
22
notices
for
96
properties.
and
we
know
that
not
counting
the
riparian
properties,
those
which
are
on
the
river
and
have
their
frontage
right
in
the
river,
there
are
a
great
number
of
properties
upland
from
the
river
which
property
owners
have
deed
rights
in
their
deeds
to
bathe,
swim
and
to
fish
and
use
the
river
for
various
recreational
purposes.
altogether,
we
would
estimate
that
there
are
approximately
200
properties
that
are
affected
in
this
neversink
riparian
section
number
4,
that's
a
seven
or
eight
mile
stretch
of
river.
and
for
these
200
properties,
there
were
only
20
notices,
or
22
notices.
the
city
did
not
even
attempt
to
post
these
notices
in
public
places
but
instead
published
--
posted
them
on
trees
and
poles
along
the
river
and
this
was
done
in
january
for
a
motion
returnable
in
march.
and
it
was
well
known
to
the
city
that
these
properties
in
this
area
are
--
some
were
occupied
mainly.
i
believe
that
--
i
will
say
nothing
further
about
the
publication
used
here
because
of
the
time.
however,
i
do
wish
to
point
out
that
it
is
our
position
that
even
these
posters
and
the
city
distinguishes
between
notice
by
publication
and
posting
that
even
these
posters
are
not
in
the
least
fit
personal
notice
of
any
kind.
and
that
is
that
there
is
nothing
personal
with
respect
to
these
handbills
that
are
posted
up
along
the
river.
the
notice
of
motion
is
all
that
it
is
that
is
posted
and
that
is
all
that
it
is
that
is
published.
it
does
not
contain
the
names
of
any
of
the
property
owners
who
are
affected.
it
does
not
advice
them
that
there
is
anything
that
they
have
to
do
in
order
to
ensure
compensation
for
themselves.
there
is
a
statute
of
limitations
here
whereby
if
their
claim
is
not
filed
within
three
years
from
the
date
of
the
title
vest,
they
are
barred
from
any
compensation
whatever.
and
the
city
has
waited
for
that
statute
of
limitations
to
expire
in
a
great
many
cases
and
has
refused
to
make
any
compensation
whatever
to
those
who
failed
to
file
claims
within
that
time.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
it
is
not
only
--
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
it
is
not
only
conceivable
your
honor
but
it
is
a
fact
that
a
great
many
of
the
property
owners
did
not
know.
you
take
this
particular
property
here
which
is
25
miles
downstream
from
the
location
where
the
river
has
been
diverted.
that
is
25
miles
downstream
from
the
dam.
as
the
river
travels
downstream,
it
picks
up
waters
from
the
tributaries
so
that
despite
the
fact
that
there
is
a
hundred
percent
or
near
a
hundred
percent
diversion
as
the
location
of
the
dam,
there
was
only
approximately
a
50%
diversion
at
the
location
of
this
property
here
in
orange
county.
a
50%
diversion
does
not
make
such
a
diversion
apparent
to
the
eye
a
layman.
the
height
of
the
stream
is
still
substantially
the
same.
the
thing
that
is
drastically
affected
is
its
temperature,
is
its
velocity
of
flow,
is
its
carrying
capacity,
the
fact
that
it
no
longer
has
a
scoured
and
cleaned
bottom
but
it's
unable
to
carry
silt
or
sedimentation.
now
the
stream
was,
before
the
diversion,
a
fleshy
stream,
that
is
that
--
had
its
times
when
it
was
high
and
when
it
was
low.
it
is
really
not
possible
for
a
layman
to
look
at
the
river
and
to
thereupon
assume
that
there
had
been
a
diversion
25
miles
upstream
that
--
it
was
a
diversion
by
a
municipality
for
water
supply
purposes
and
that
it
had
to
file
a
claim
for
compensation
or
was
even
entitled
to
compensation
within
any
specified
time.
there
was
no
way
that
a
layman
would
know
that
unless
that
person
happened
to
hear
about
it
in
some
fortuitous
manner.
in
any
event
the
statute
--
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
in
this
case,
although
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record,
there
was
a
consultation
with
an
engineer
and
the
engineer
told
mrs.
schroeder
what
had
occurred
and
discussed
with
her
the
fact
that
she
--
that
this
was
an
artificial
diversion
for
which
she
had
a
right
to
file
a
claim
for
compensation.
now
--
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
well,
their
--
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
there
was
no
question
about
--
but
that
--
that
is
so
your
honor.
the
city
has
denied
that
in
answer
--
answering
brief
here.
however,
if
your
honor
would
--
if
your
honors
would
examine
the
map
which
is
defendant's
exhibit
a
in
evidence
here,
your
honors
would
see
that
the
index
shows
parcel
no.
424
is
listed
to
madeline
schroeder.
and
if
your
honors
would
look
at
parcel
no.
424,
you
would
see
that
its
frontage
in
the
river
was
mapped
down
to
a
tenth
of
a
foot,
that
all
properties
are
mapped
down
to
a
tenth
of
a
foot.
these
maps
are
filed
in
the
county
clerk's
office
before
the
proceeding
has
commenced.
and
consequently,
in
order
to
obtain
all
the
detailed
information
that
the
city
has
to
obtain
to
prepare
these
maps,
it
has
made
deed
studies
and
--
our
deeds
as
mentioned
in
the
complaint,
it
contains
our
address,
the
address
of
this
property
owner
in
new
jersey
where
she
lives
in
the
winter,
and
of
course
the
city
knows
the
address
of
the
property
it
is
taking,
and
knows
the
--
its
post
office
address
at
the
property
itself.
there
was
no
question
for
that,
the
name
and
the
address
of
this
property
owner
was
known
to
the
city
or
could
have
been
ascertained
without
any
difficulty
whatever.
the
tax
rolls
had
her
name
and
her
new
jersey
address
for
example.
a
letter
mailed
to
her
at
the
property
would
have
been
forwarded
to
her
in
new
jersey
if
it
were
done
on
the
winter.
she
would
receive
it
herself
if
it
were
done
in
the
summer.
there
was
no
basis
here
to
claim
as
the
city
has
claimed
that
they
were
--
that
they
did
not
know
her
address,
unless
by
that,
the
city
means
that
some
attorney
or
other
official
of
the
city
wanted
to
know
ms.
schroeder
address
and
just
didn't
think
of
what
it
was
and
didn't
have
it
in
his
head
because
he
certainly
had
it
in
his
files.
it's
impossible
to
draw
any
other
reasonable
conclusion,
if
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
thank
you.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
a
few
minutes
if
i
may.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
with
respect
to
the
address,
if
the
city
would've
merely
mailed
notices
to
each
property
owner
at
the
location
of
the
property,
now
mr.
lee
could
not
deny
that
it
did
not
know
the
post
office
address
at
parcel
number
424
which
it
had
mapped
on
--
and
placed
on
its
maps.
that
property
had
a
post
office
address,
would've
been
no
effort
to
find
that
one
and
a
letter
mailed
to
the
claimant
at
that
particular
address
would've
certainly
reached
her.
in
any
of
event
i
say
that
this
argument
by
the
city
at
this
point
that
it
did
not
have
the
names,
the
addresses
is
truly
not
a
fair
argument
for
it
to
make
for
this
reason.
what
if
it
did
have
their
addresses?
each
and
every
one
of
their
addresses
in
--
at
the
property
and
wherever
else
they
live,
it
didn't
send
any
notices
to
anyone.
no
one
received
any
mail
from
the
city
of
new
york
as
to
this
taking.
it
sent
notices
to
no
one,
not
even
people
who
lived
right
at
the
riparian
property.
so,
consequently
their
argument
now
that
they
didn't
have
the
name
and
addresses
is
truly
a
much
belated
excuse
and
that's
not
a
reason
for
not
mailing
notice.
certainly,
with
respect
to
mr.
lee's
statement
that
the
newspapers
were
selected
in
orange
county
because
they
were
weekly
newspapers
and
the
two
newspapers
near
this
property,
one
just
seven
miles
away
and
one
published
in
the
city
eight
miles
away,
both
cities
on
either
side
of
this
property.
and
having
circulation
in
this
area,
the
reason
that
they
selected
these
small
newspapers
as
--
he
states
22
and
27
miles
away
was
that
the
other
newspapers
were
weekly,
and
these
city
newspapers
were
daily.
well,
if
we
look
and
see
what
the
city
of
new
york
did
in
adjoining
sullivan
county,
we
see
that
even
that
argument
is
not
a
sincere
one.
in
sullivan
county
section
number
3
runs
three
miles
east
of
the
county
seat
of
monticello
which
publishes
three
weekly
newspapers.
instead
of
publishing
in
those
newspapers
right
in
the
vicinity
of
the
taking
and
i
might
add
that
there
were
newspapers
of
both
political
faiths
that
that
made
any
difference
to
the
city
selection
of
newspapers.
they
went
to
the
far
western
end
of
the
county
in
callicoon,
a
newspaper
that
until
its
editor
run
for
assembly,
i,
living
in
sullivan
county
did
not
even
ever
hear
off.
and
also
published
in
a
liberty
advisor
which
is
a
giveaway
newspaper,
it's
not
even
sold.now,
this
is
in
the
briefs.
it's
a
newspaper
which
just
contains
advertisements
and
a
few
--
a
few
of
these
canned
stories
and
is
not
even
sold
for
two
cents.
it's
just
given
away.
and
those
of
the
newspapers
of
the
city
of
new
york
used
to
give
notice
of
this
taking.
in
these
communities
in
section
number
4,
there
were
three
communities,
cuddebackville,
huguenot,
and
--
the
name
of
the
other
community
is
just
staging
for
the
moment.
each
of
these
communities
have
post
offices,
firehouses,
grange
halls,
gas
stations,
the
city
posted
no
notices
in
any
of
these
public
places
but
stuck
them
up
on
trees
in
the
wood
--
in
the
middle
of
the
winter.
this
notice
may
look
pretty
here.
it's
new
and
it's
fresh
and
it's
clean,
but
it
doesn't
quite
look
the
same
after
it's
been
on
a
tree
for
long
ago.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
well,
this
is
the
only
type
of
an
action.
actually,
it
could've
been
brought,
that
would
place
the
question
of
title,
squarely
an
issue.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
no.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
no.
i
--
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
no.
your
honor,
actually
as
we've
explained
in
the
briefs
and
as
judge
dye
recognized
in
his
dissent,
its
not
practical
now
to
have
injunctive
relief
against
the
city
of
new
york.
but
at
the
very
least,
the
relief
that
could
be
granted
if
this
case
were
remanded,
reversed
and
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
relief
as
justice
dye
indicates
would
be
that
the
city
would
have
to
give
adequate
notice
to
all
of
these
people
who
are
presently
waiting
with
cases
in
lower
courts
throughout
the
state
for
the
outcome
of
this
case.
these
people
would
all
be
given
further
notice.
they'd
have
their
day
in
court
and
that's
all
that
matters.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
thank
you.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
well,
mr.
lee
can
give
your
honor
the
exact
answer.
i
say
that
there
are
two
to
300.
mr.
lee
knows
precisely
how
many
there
are
because
claims
are
filed
with
the
law
department
and
he
knows
how
many
claims
had
been
filed
and
rejected,
i
don't.
i
know
this,
that
out
of
224
mapped
parcels,
an
examination
of
a
certain
record
kept
by
the
city
of
new
york
showed
that
less
than
half
of
the
property
owners
filed
their
claims
in
time.
i
also
know
from
other
cases
in
the
lower
courts,
this
riley
case
and
the
nielson
case
mentioned
in
the
briefs,
several
of
them
being
representative
cases
involving
many,
many
properties
that
there
are
hundreds
of
other
upland
properties
which
are
additional
to
the
224
mapped
on
the
city's
maps,
that
a
great
number
of
which
did
file
claims
in
time
and
a
very
great
number
of
which,
some
of
them
--
which
claims
i
have
--
failed
to
file
their
claims
in
time
simply
because
they
were
not
aware
of
what
had
taken
place
in
the
river
and
incidentally
--
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
--
our
complaint
specifically
is
very
specific
on
that
point.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
well,
it
would
be
simple
not
for
us
to
prove
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
oh,
yes.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
very
definitely,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
yes,
your
honor,
there
was
just
no
question
about
that.
we
state
it
in
several
different
respects
and
we
also
state
very
clearly
and
unequivocally
that
this
woman
had
no
knowledge
of
the
city's
application
of
the
right
to
diversion
--
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
yes.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
yes,
there's
even
that
allegation.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
well
--
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
i
believe
it's
on
page
10
or
at
the
bottom
of
page
9
of
this
record.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
here
it
is,
at
paragraph
20
of
the
complaint,
at
the
bottom
of
page
9,
that
the
plaintiff
has
never
been
at
any
time
notified
in
any
manner
that
the
city
of
new
york
sought
to
acquire
the
right
to
divert
the
neversink
river,
just
as
clear
as
could
be.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
it
has
not
--
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
it
had
not
been
changed.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
that's
the
reason
the
layman
cannot
tell,
the
artificial
diversion
that
has
taken
place.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
the
damage
is
at
the
bathing
and
the
fishing
has
been
destroyed.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
this
neversink
used
to
be
one
of
the
most
famous
trout
streams.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
east
of
the
mississippi
river.
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
no
question
about
that,
your
honor
--
mr.
louis
b.
scheinman
the
awards
--
the
awards
on
these
properties
have
run
some
--
in
the
commercial
properties
to
a
hundred
thousand
dollars.
