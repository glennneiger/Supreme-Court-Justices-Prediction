justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
this
case
decided
in
the
pleadings,
judgment
on
the
pleadings?
justice
potter
stewart
and
wasn't
there
an
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
she
didn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
at
least
ambiguous,
isn't
this
something
that
--
let's
assume
that
you're
correct
that
whatever
the
shortcomings
of
a
statute
as
to
notice
might
be
constitutionally,
that
if
the
petitioner
had
--
had
actual
notice
and
that
could
be
shown
that
these
--
that
this
--
in
this
case
she
was
not
deprived
of
her
property
by
--
in
violation
of
due
process
of
law,
but
isn't
that
a
matter
of
proof
in
view
of
the
allegation
of
the
complaint.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
mean,
isn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
i'm
really
suggesting
to
you
is
that
the
--
you're
telling
us
about
where
these
notices
were
posted
and
so
on
and
you
tried
to
make
that
proof
to
us,
but
this
was
a
case
decided
on
the
pleadings
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
the
allegation
to
the
complaint
was
she
didn't
know.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
at
least
it's
subject
to
different
readings,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you're
right
--
excuse
me
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
my
only
thought
--
the
thought
behind
my
question
was
this,
that
if
you
are
right,
the
actual
knowledge,
pure
as
any
constitutional
defect
in
the
statute,
that
should
--
or
perhaps
to
be
a
matter
of
proof
in
this
case
rather
than
--
rather
than
to
have
it
something
decided
on
the
--
on
the
pleadings.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
you're
saying
then
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
this
statute,
whether
she
knew
about
it
--
actually
knew
about
it
or
didn't
know
it,
this
statute
is
constitutionally
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
so,
if
she
showed
that
she
was
in
europe
for
ten
years
while
this
was
going
on
and
there
was
no
caretaker
in
her
property,
still
the
state
could
do
this
to
her
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case,
we
have
to
take
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
i
beg
your
pardon.
in
this
case
we
have
to
take
what
said
in
the
complaint
is
true,
do
we
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
can't,
because
this
was
decided
on
the
pleadings,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
you
can't
and
we
can't
and
in
the
posture
that
this
case
is
now
in.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i'd
--
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
the
dissenters
in
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
dye
says
at
the
bottom
of
page
51
of
the
record
in
the
dissenting
opinion
that
the
city
did
have
available,
the
appellant's
address.
and
no
reason
appears
why
such
a
notice
could
not
have
been
given,
is
that
--
do
you
challenge
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
or?
justice
potter
stewart
but
stated
in
the
paragraph
of
the
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
as
pointed
out
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
there's
no
allegation
--
there's
no
allegation
that
she
didn't
know
what
the
river
had
been
diverted.
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
couldn't
find
it
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
i
meant
was,
there's
no
showing
and
i'm
probably
--
there
isn't
any
allegation
because
probably
the
facts
are
--
couldn't
support
an
allegation.
she
presumably
did
know
that
the
river's
course
had
been
changed
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
what's
the
damage
to
her
property?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see,
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
riparian
land?
