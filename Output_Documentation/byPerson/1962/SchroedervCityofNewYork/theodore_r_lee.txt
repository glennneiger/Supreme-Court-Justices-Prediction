mr.
theodore
r.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
preliminarily,
i
would
like
to
establish
that
the
city
complied
with
the
various
provisions
of
the
water
supply
act,
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
found
that
the
city
had
complied
with
those
provisions.
and
i
respectfully
submit
that,
this
court
is
bound
by
that
finding.
i
shall
confine
my
argument
in
view
of
the
limitation
in
our
time
today
to
the
proposition
that
the
notice
provided
by
statute
and
given
here
was
constitutionally
sufficient.
the
handbills
that
were
posted
were
printed
with
permanent
ink
on
durable
cloth,
approximately
two
feet
long
by
a
foot
and
a
half
wide
and
they
were
firmly
affixed
to
the
places
to
which
they
were
attached.
this
is
a
facsimile
of
the
handbill
and
it's
not
likely
that
this
handbill
would
be
mistaken
for
a
no
trespassing,
hunting
or
fishing
sign.
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
it
shows
that
the
--
it's
an
application
for
appointment
of
commissioners
of
appraisal
to
determine
damages
to
properties,
these
are
riparian
properties,
properties
that
are
located
between
cuddebackville
and
huguenot
so
that
would
definitely
indicate
this
particular
individuals'
interest
in
it.
now,
these
--
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
not
except
that
on
the
particular
day,
an
application
will
be
made
for
the
commission
to
divert
and
--
for
the
appointment
of
commissions
of
appraisal.

lee
--
21
and
22a,
i
think
it
is.
i
intended
to
making
that
but
neglected
to.
now,
there
were
five
sections
here
and
there
were
22
or
23
of
these
posters
post
up
in
every
section
which
means
that
there
were
112
posters
all
tolled
in
these
proceedings.
now
this
present
case
furnishes
a
good
example
of
how
these
posters
were
put
where
they
were
likely
to
be
seen.
the
only
way,
absolutely
the
only
way,
they
will
get
to
the
appellant's
property
is
by
turning
off
to
route
209,
the
road
that
roughly
parallels
the
river
on
the
west
side
on
to
a
narrow,
unpaved,
dead-end
road
only
three
tenths
of
a
mile
long.
and
only
the
appellant's
cottage
and
two
or
three
other
cottages
were
on
this
short
road.
now,
one
of
these
handbills
was
posted
right
at
the
junction,
the
route
209,
and
this
short
road
where
anyone
turning
off
in
view
of
the
narrowness
of
the
road,
anyone
turning
off
of
the
appellant's
property
couldn't
possibly
miss
seeing
that
notice.
and
i
say,
whether
she
saw
it
or
not,
that
anyone
who
saw
that
notice
would
observe,
be
likely
to
observe
that
it
was
a
legal
notice.
and
anyone
of
some
kind,
and
anyone
living
on
that
short
road
would
be
likely
to
read
it,
to
see
if
it
applied
to
her
property
or
her
neighbor's
property
and
if
anybody
did
read
it
as
i
explained
before
that
he
--
put
on
notices
to
what
this
was
all
about.
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
yes,
sir.
it
was
on
a
motion
on
the
judgment
of
the
pleading.
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
there
was
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
--
well,
no,
there
was
a
--
this
was
a
situation,
the
complaint
alleged
that
she
--
before
the
retention
of
counsel
in
september
1959,
that
she
was
not
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
city
had
acquired
any
portion
of
her
property.
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
she
also
said
that,
she
was
not
aware
of
the
fact
that
she
had
a
right
to
file
a
claim
but
there
i
think
it's
very
significant
that
she
does
not
specifically
allege
that
she
was
unaware
of
the
diversion.
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
a
matter
to
prove
as
to
whether
she
had
noticed
it
or
not?
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
i
don't
--
i
wouldn't
say
so.
by
the
way,
i
won't
--
i
might
add
this
to
clarify
(voice

--
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
--
even
before
--
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
but
the
--
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
well,
in
the
record
there
is
an
affidavit
of
an
alfred
j.
may,
which
tells
exactly
where
these
posters
were
put
--
afoot.
now,
and
i'll
return
--
i
want
to
clarify
this,
you
acted
about
what
appeared
in
the
complaint,
in
addition
to
the
things
i
mentioned,
it
says
that
she
wasn't
aware
of
the
proceedings.
it
didn't
say
that
she
was
not
aware
of
the
verdict
--
diversion
since
she
was
aware
of
the
proceeding.
now,
--
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
sought
to
acquire
--
sought
to
(voice

--
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
--
acquire
the
right
to
divert.
she
said,
she
didn't
acquire
the
right
to
divert,
but
that
doesn't
say
that
she
didn't
know
about
the
diversion
as
i
read
it.
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
that
the
way
i
--
the
way
i
interpret
it,
there
are
--
maybe
to
an
actual
amount
of
arguments
over
the
subject,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
since
you
put
all
of
these
different
allegations
in,
that
there's
--
it
looks
like
she
carefully
omitted
to
say
she
was
not
aware
--
that
she
was
unaware
of
the
diversion.
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
well,
we're
not
depending
so
much
on
actual
notice
in
this
case
under
these
circumstances.
but
the
test
that
has
been
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
preceding
cases
down
to
the
years
is
whether
or
not
the
notice
is
reasonably
--
kept
reasonably
calculated
to
come
to
the
attention
of
the
parties.
and
i
say
that,
in
view
of
the
posting,
in
view
of
the
publication,
in
view
of
the
patently
visible
effect
of
the
diversion,
and
in
view
of
the
nature
of
these
proceedings,
and
the
nature
of
the
project
which
was
so
big
that
it
would
be
bound
to
come
to
the
attention
of
everybody
around,
in
view
of
all
of
these
circumstances,
the
notice
given
here,
whether
she
saw
it
or
whether
she
didn't
see
--
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
(inaudible)
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
exactly
and
that
any
further
--
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
that
is
absolutely
right
that
being
a
nonresident
here,
she
would
be
under
some
--
a
resident
of
new
jersey,
she
would
be
under
some
duty
to
come
here
because
this
notice
in
view
of
all
these
circumstances
i
make
--
mentioned,
this
notice
was
so
sufficient
that
it
seems
to
me,
to
require
any
different
or
additional
notice
would
be
merely
superfluous.
now
the
notice
was
--
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
well,
i
wouldn't
say
so,
because
this
court
has
said
in
a
number
of
opinions
if
the
nonresidents
who
live
on
property
usually
have
a
way
of
finding
out
things
that
are
happening
to
their
property.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
she
owned
the
property
in
new
york
and
according
to
the
allegation
of
the
complaint
and
the
statements
in
the
brief,
she
spend
about
two
months
--
two
months
every
year
at
this
property.
and
its
inconceivable
to
me
how
under
those
circumstances,
she
wouldn't
hear
about
the
construction
of
this
huge
reservoir
and
she
wouldn't
see
this
poster,
and
if
she
did
see
it,
that
she
--
she
wouldn't
read
it.
but
i
say
under
all
other
facts
and
circumstances,
this
notice
is
given,
we
bear
in
mind
that
we
are
acquiring
limited
inputs,
the
right
to
divert
here.
and
under
these
peculiar
circumstances
particularly,
the
notice
given
here
was
legally
sufficient.
now,
if
i
may
address
myself
briefly
to
this
newspaper
--
these
newspaper
publications,
the
question
was
asked,
i
believe,
by
justice
harlan,
i
believe
it
was
in
regard
with
the
purpose
of
new
york
city
papers.
one
of
the
new
york
city
papers
that
was
published
then
was
the
new
york
times,
and
of
course
it
has
a
circulation
outside
of
the
area.
but
i'm
not
stressing
that
so
much
as
to
indicate
that
--
i
think
it
does
have
some
tendency
to
give
some
notice.
but
my
friend,
mr.
scheinman
here
has
suggested
that
we
should've
had
picked
out
different
local
newspapers
in
orange
county.
and
now,
it
happened
--
and
that
he
suggested,
we
should
have
published
to
newspapers
in
the
cities
in
orange
county.
but
this
is
what
i
suggest
and
that
is,
those
were
weekly
newspapers.
it
may
be
that
their
circulation
wasn't
as
great
as
city
newspapers
might
be.
but
when
people
read
these
weekly
newspapers,
they're
inclined
to
read
them
all
the
way
through
including
legal
notices.
and
when
they
read
them,
they
start
talking
about
them,
to
their
friends
and
neighbors.
so,
the
court
of
appeals
found,
the
majority
of
the
court
did,
that
these
were
appropriate
newspapers.
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
there
--
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
there
were
a
couple
--
i
think
one
in
port
jervis
and
the
other
one
i
believe
is
--
was
middletown
who
--
that
were
somewhat
closer
to
this
particular
property
although
the
three
immediate
communities
around
closest
to
her
did
not
publish
newspaper.
there
were
two
city
newspapers
located
in
orange
county
that
were
somewhat
closer.
i
might
say
this
in
view
of
the
statement
in
the
appellant's
brief.
i
don't
know
if
it
mentioned
here,
he
said
these
newspapers
were
some
30
or
40
miles
away.
actually
by
a
road,
there
were
22
and
27
miles
away
respectively
or
direct
--
in
a
direct
line,
17
and
six-tenths
and
18
and
two-tenths
miles
away.
they
weren't
--
there
were
some
distance
away
but
they
weren't
quite
afar
away
as
suggested
by
the
appellant.
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
the
record
i
think
would
show
that
the
name
was
available.
i
do
believe
the
record
is
silent
as
to
whether
the
address
--
there
wasn't
--
there
was
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
and
i
think
the
record
didn't
--
is
silent
on
that
point
in
regard
to
whether
the
city
knew
the
appellant's
address
although
the
appellant
now
contends
that
the
city
did.
and
the
fact
is
that
although
--
of
course,
the
city
knew
the
location
of
this
property,
it
didn't
have
the
appellant's
post
office
address.
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
well,
the
--
there's
a
difference
between
the
legal
description
of
property
and
the
post
address.
it's
impossible
to
tell
just
where
those
lines
are.
and
also
from
these
deed
studies
that
he
mentioned,
they
were
prepared
by
engineers
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
the
maps
and
they
showed
only
the
names
of
the
owners
and
the
description
of
the
property
so
that
wasn't
the
source
of
information
regarding
--
regarding
their
address.
in
any
event,
the
addresses
are
not
a
reliable
source
of
informa
--
deeds
are
not
a
reliable
source
of
information
concerning
the
addresses,
bearing
in
mind
there
were
over
400
properties
involved
in
this
proceeding.
many
of
the
deeds
would
be
old,
the
addresses
of
the
grantors
who
were
shown
frequently
not
the
addresses
of
the
property
and
the
addresses
--
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
--
of
the
grantees
are
frequently
the
addresses
from
which
they're
moving
instead
of
--
to
which
they
moved.
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
a
tax
--
taxes,
i
presume
were
--
would
be
assessed
to
the
property
and
my
friend,
mr.
scheinman,
suggest
that
we
should've
consulted
the
tax
records.
but
i
submit
and
that's
reasonable
to
do
when
the
taxing
authority
of
the
condemnor
is
one
of
the
same.
but
i
call
attention
to
the
fact,
here
we
were
condemning
interest
in
over
400
properties
outside
of
the
city
limits
and
have
a
dozen
different
tax
districts.
and
in
view
of
the
adequacy
of
the
notice
and
the
nature
of
these
proceedings,
i
respectfully
submit
that
there
should
be
no
requirement
for
us
to
look
at
all
of
these
different
tax
records
and
all
of
these
deeds
because
that
would
unreasonably
delay
the
proceeding
and
put
the
city
to
an
unnecessary
expense
in
view
of
the
other
surrounding
circumstances
--
mr.
theodore
r.
lee
the
--
these
particular
notices
were
copies
sent
out
from
kingston,
new

and
also
one

in
these
particular
notices
were
probably
sent
out
from
the
kingston
office.

doesn't

we
also,

i've
said,

that
deed
study,
we
had
a
description
of
the
property.

mr.

it
is
possible
that
through

to
searching
the
deeds
or
searching
of
the
tax
records,
it
might
have
been
possible
and
i
suggest
that
it
should
be
required
over
the
circumstances
here
where
there's
a
limited
interest
being
taken
in
--
for
such
a
big
project.
mr.

oh,
i

don't
challenge
it
to
this
extent.
i

by
that

by
that
he
meant
that
we
could've
consulted
tax
records
or
looked
at
deeds

probably
have
done
little
more
than
we
did

do.
that's
the
way
i
interpret
that.
