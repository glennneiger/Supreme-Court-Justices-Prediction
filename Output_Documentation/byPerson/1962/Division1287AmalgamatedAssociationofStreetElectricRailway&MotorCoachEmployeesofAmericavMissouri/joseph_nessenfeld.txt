mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
addressing
myself
first
to
the
mootness
issue,
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
missouri
that
this
case
is
in
fact
as
moot
as
was
local
no.
86,
which
this
court
decided
several
years
ago.
it
was
moot
because
there
was
no
subject
matter
then
in
existence
upon
which
the
judgment
of
this
court
could
operate.
what
the
appellant's
overlook
is
the
nature
of
this
case
and
the
nature
of
the
relief
sought.
in
this
case,
the
parties
were
the
state
of
missouri
as
the
plaintiff,
the
union
and
the
various
officials
and
members
as
the
defendants.
the
state
sought
an
injunction.
the
state
obtained
an
injunction.
there
was
no
declaratory
relief
sought
or
granted.
the
union
then
appealed,
seeking
relief
from
the
restraint
imposed
by
that
injunction
that
is
all
they
could
seek
on
appeal
by
the
action
of
the
governor
and
releasing
the
property
to
the
company
not
in
order
to
avoid
mootness.
that
i
think
is
a
reflection
upon
the
governor
of
missouri.
he
did
so
because
it
was
the
mandatory
duty
of
the
governor
under
the
opinion
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
in
this
very
case
to
release
the
property
just
as
soon
as
in
his
judgment,
based
on
his
investigation
of
the
facts
then
existing,
some
14
months
later
in
the
initial
seizure,
that
there
was
no
dire,
immediate,
imminent
threat
of
jeopardy
or
disaster
to
the
citizens
of
the
state
or
the
community
of
kansas
city.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
no
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
the
record
does
not
reflect
the
change
in
conditions
and
i
am
unaware
of
that.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
the
governor
made
an
investigation.
the
governor
made
a
determination,
your
honor.
it
was
--
he
made
the
initial
determination
that
there
was
jeopardy.
it
could
well
have
been,
your
honor,
that
he
may
have
decided
this
late
date
that
he
was
erroneous
in
his
initial
determination.
that
is
possible,
but
that's
neither
here
nor
there
but
has
now
made
a
determination
based
on
the
facts
now
existing
that
there
is
no
threat
of
jeopardy
and
therefore
no
need
for
the
state
of
missouri
to
retain
possession
and
operate
the
system
in
kansas
city.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
i
couldn't
put
it
that
way
your
honor.
i
think
in
this
case
the
decision
of
mootness
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
parties
are
no
longer
restrained.
they
are
no
longer
affected,
there
is
no
judgment
affecting
them,
there
is
no
legal
controversy.
the
only
controversy
in
existence
now
is
the
academic
one
of
this
law,
is
whether
it's
valid
or
invalid.
there
may
or
may
not
be
other
ways
of
testing
the
validity
of
the
law
but
it
certainly
isn't
by
means
of
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
which
no
longer
in
existence.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
all
i
could
say
your
honor
is
this.
if
in
the
judgment
of
the
governor,
he
believes
that
there
is
such
a
dire,
imminent
threat
of
disaster
as
to
warrant
and
justify
seizure
he
could
do
so.
i
seriously
doubt
that
he
would,
because
i
am
certain
they
took
that
in
consideration
in
releasing
the
property.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
the
stated
grounds
were
simply
that
in
his
judgment
that
there
was
a
threat
of
imminent
jeopardy
through
the
public
interest,
health
and
welfare.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
there
were
no
specifications.
the
law
does
not
require
that
he
specify
the
grounds.
his
action
of
course
is
subject
to
this
review
as
the
[inaudible]
court
has
held
and
the
trial
court
held
that
he
was
justified
on
the
evidence
in
making
that
determination.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
the
evidence
showed
--
well
all
i
can
do
is
repeat
what
the
missouri
supreme
court,
how
they
summarized
the
evidence
in
the
opinion.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
well
your
honor
that
is
quite
true.
however
it
is,
as
we
see
it,
the
appellants
have
taken
the
position
in
this
case
that
irrespective
of
whether
the
facts
in
this
case
justify
the
governor
in
seizing
the
property,
irrespective
of
whether
the
trial
court
was
justified
in
upholding
the
governor
is
finding
of
jeopardy,
that
even
if
the
evidence
disclosed
jeopardy
of
the
most
dire
character,
their
position
nevertheless
is
that
the
law
is
invalid
as
a
matter
of
law
and
that
is
--
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
well
there
was
evidence
of
confusion,
evidently
chaos?
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
in
--
oh
well,
all
i
can
do
is
read
what
the
supreme
court
said
in
their
opinion.
the
court
[inaudible]
the
record
in
this
case
that
the
further
continuance
of
the
concerted
work
stoppage
by
defendants
on
the
circumstances
shown
could
well,
might
well
have
resulted
in
extreme
danger
to
the
health,
welfare
and
safety
of
the
inhabitants
of
kansas
city,
missouri
and
an
unrest,
general
confusion,
disorganization,
excitement,
tension,
inability
to
reach
places
of
employment
of
the
retail
district
of
the
city,
reduction
of
employment
and
loss
of
wages
by
innocent
victims
of
the
strike,
congestion
of
traffic,
destruction
of
business,
reduction
and
impairment
of
law
enforcement
agencies
and
the
creation
of
havoc,
disaster
and
general
chaos
in
the
community.
and
that
is
what
the
court
said,
that
the
trial
court
could
have
found.
i
can't
point
specifically
to
any
specific
testimony
in
the
record.
i
say
it
is
conceivable
that
the
court
may
well
have
been
wrong
in
the
finding
jeopardy
here,
but
that
certainly
doesn't
invalidate
this
law.
that
is
what
they
want
here,
they
said
in
their
reply
brief
they
will
not
settle
the
cases
unless
the
law
is
thrown
out.
that
is
all
that's
holding
up
settlement
here
your
honor.
so
that
the
[inaudible]
makes
no
difference
how
much
jeopardy
there
was?
it's
the
law
which
is
the
subject
of
their
attack,
not
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
and
if
the
laws
that
are
thrown
out,
it
certainly
couldn't
be
thrown
out
on
the
ground
of
--
as
the
lower
courts
made
an
error
in
the
determination
of
the
fact.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
yes.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
i
did
not
believe
with
a
fair
instance
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
in
this
particular
case,
whether
he
sees
it
three
times,
because
there
are
three
disputes,
i
think
that
is
true.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
transportation
strikes,
there
were
some,
i
think,
not
in
kansas
city.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
no,
i'm
not
aware
of
it
and
in
further
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
might
say
this
that
until
the
present
opinion
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
clarified
and
i
think
they
made
the
point
clear,
the
real
meaning
of
the
stuatute,
the
governors
of
the
states
were
i
would
say
unaware
of
the
extent
of
their
authority
to
act
and
the
circumstance
under
which
they
are
justified
enacted
and
--
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
i
don't
think
that
that
was
testified
in
that
way
your
honor.
i
believe
that
in
this
case,
type
of
case
of
this
kind
that
there
would
less
likelihood
of
the
transit
company
being
siezed
in
the
future
than
there
was
in
the
past,
because
of
the
stress
laid
in
the
opinion
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
not
once,
but
three
or
four
times
on
a
necessity
that
there
be
an
imminent
drift
of
dire
disaster.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
he
did.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
he
did
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
i
think
what
has
changed
is
the
emphasis,
the
color
placed
upon
the
language
and
meaning
of
the
act,
i
think
there
has
been
a
change
your
honor.
the
language
of
the
act
itself
hasn't
said
it
in
words,
but
i
think
that
as
construed
by
the
court
in
this
case,
something
has
changed
which
maybe
subjective,
but
it
does
have
some
bearing
upon
the
future
conduct
of
our
governors.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
well,
certainly
your
honor
i'm
unaware
of
the
conditions
in
kansas
city,
i
can't
--
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
the
conditions
that
was
found
by
the
governor,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
i
can't
speak
for
the
governor,
i
don't
know
what
he
found.
this
record
certainly
doesn't
reflect
anything
other
than
what
occurred
in
the
first
several
days
after
this
strike
and
further
strike
took
place.
everything
that's
in
this
record
is
pretty
ancient
and
much
could
have
happened
in
somewhere
in
those
14
months
since
then.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
i
don't
think
there
is,
your
honor.
i
see
no
point
on
that.
of
course,
at
the
time
the
governor
acted,
the
true
effect
of
what
he
did
wasn't
immediately
apparent
and
it
became
apparent
in
the
light
of
the
decision
of
the
court
in
this
case,
which
held
that
any
release
by
the
governor
would
operate
of
itself
to
relieve
the
parties
of
their
restraints
imposed
by
the
judges.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
true.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
it
has
certainly
litterally
[inaudible]
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
no
question
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
subject
to
judicial
review.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
that
is
true.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
i
may
add
your
honor,
it's
not
only
a
stike
but
also
of
the
lock
out
is
[inaudible].
this
statute
works
both
ways.
as
i
say,
we
do
feel
that
this
case,
there
is
no
subject
matter
presently
in
existence
upon
which
any
judge
under
this
court
could
now
offer.
now
addressing
myself
in
the
brief
time
remaining
to
the
merits;
all
that
is
involved
in
this
case
are
certain
sections
of
the
act,
not
the
act
as
a
whole.
the
missouri
court
held
that
the
act
was
seperable
and
that
irrespective
of
the
validity
or
invalidity
of
any
of
the
remaining
portions,
they
didn't
concede
or
make
any
intimation
that
means
the
rest
of
it
was
invalid.
but
and
so,
these
sections
authorizing
seizure
and
no
strike
during
the
pendency
of
the
seizure
stood
on
their
own
feet
and
were
not
related
to
necessarily,
were
independent
of
any
provisions
with
respect
to
the
state
mediation
board,
powers,
duties
and
functions
of
appreaing
panels,
also
hearings
or
what
have
you.
so,
the
real
question
here
on
preemption
is
simply
whether
congress
by
the
enactment
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947
intended
or
manifested
clearly
and
explicitly
an
intent
to
[inaudible]
of
a
state
of
of
missouri
or
any
state
for
that
matter,
the
right
in
power
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
public,
not
on
behalf
of
either
the
union
or
the
employer,
but
on
behalf
of
the
public
to
protect
the
public
in
the
event
of
an
emergency,
which
threatens
imminent
disasters
to
the
public
health
welfare
and
safety
of
the
public
and
to
by
virtue
of
such
threat
to
take
possession
of
the
property
or
utility
not
necessarily
a
transit,
but
gas
or
electric
or
other
such
more
basic
utility
and
to
operate
the
same
in
the
public
interest,
during
the
period
of
such
state
seizure
and
possession.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
in
my
judgment,
the
state
did
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
the
state
--
governor
first
appointed
mr.
daniel
c.
rogers
as
the
chairman
of
state
mediation
board
as
his
agent
to
take
possession
of
property,
and
in
his
executive
order
he
gave
him
broad
powers
and
directed
that
the
internal
rules
and
regulations
of
the
company
utility
remain
in
existence,
and
the
company
then
acted
as
the
agent
of
the
state
in
operating
the
utility
during
the
pendency
of
the
seizure.
the
law
does
not
require
that
happen
in
that
way,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
there
was
no
change
in
personnel,
your
honor.
as
i
said,
the
law
does
not
require
it
be
done
in
that
way.
this
was
one
of
the
alternatives
facing
the
governor
and
it
seems
to
me
is
a
very
practical
way
of
handling
the
situation.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
in
any
other
way,
your
honor,
no.
that's
the
way
it
was
done.
as
i
say,
the
law
does
not
require
to
be
done
in
that
way
and
possession.
the
fact
that
possession
is
conceded,
it's
admitted
in
the
answer
of
the
appellant's,
that
possession
in
this
case
carries
with
it
the
right
of
control
and
the
right
of
control
carries
with
it
the
right
to
decide
how
it
should
be
operated
during
the
tendency
of
the
seizure.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
no,
your
honor,
it
did
not.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
yes.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
the
state
did
not
pay.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
no,
your
honor.
our
position
simply
isn't
that
the
--
by
virtue
of
the
exclusion
of
the
state
as
an
employer
from
the
national
act
that
the
state
can
do
what
it
has
done
here.
we
don't
contend
the
state
is
the
employer
of
these
--
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
we
put
no
substantial
weight
on
the
exclusion,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
it
comes
down
to
the
emergency
aspect
with
these
added
facts
that
when
the
state
having
taken
possession
as
it
did,
no
question
about
it,
with
the
right
and
operating
it
as
it
did,
when
the
state
does
so,
no
one
whether
they
be
employees
or
otherwise
should
have
the
right
by
concerted
action.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
we
are
not
asking
you
to
add
any
exceptions
at
all,
your
honor.
we
are
simply
saying
that
congress
in
the
act
itself
did
not
expressly
manifest
an
intent
to
prohibit
this
type
of
action
by
the
state.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
section
7
does
protect
concerted
activities.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
i
don't
think
the
act
is
quite
that
broad,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
section
13
provides
that
nothing
in
this
act
except
that
[inaudible]
construes
it
was
either
to
interfere
with
or
impede
or
diminish
in
any
way
the
right
to
strike
or
to
affect
the
limitations
or
qualifications
on
that
right.
now
we
contend
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
absolute
right
to
strike,
anymore
than
an
absolute
right
to
do
almost
anything.
for
example,
a
man
--
facts
of
the
example,
may
not
shout
fire!
in
the
crowded
theatre,
but
he
may
shout
fire!
if
there
is
no
one
around.
in
this
case,
when
the
state
in
order
to
protect
the
public
as
a
mutual,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
controversy
between
the
employer
and
employee
itself,
but
when
there
is
a
disaster
threatening
to
the
public
and
the
state
steps
in
to
take
action,
then
no
one
be
the
employers
or
otherwise
shall
have
any
right
or
should
have
any
right
to
take
any
action
concertedly
to
interfere
with
what
the
state
is
doing
to
protect
the
public
interest
and
welfare.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
the
right
to
strike
doesn't
give
way,
as
such
it
is
postponed.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
yes
sir.
this
act
leaves
untouched
any
right
as
between
employer
and
employee
in
support,
when
i
say
this
act,
i
am
speaking
solely
of
these
particular
sections
and
they
are,
because
this
act
means
these
sections
involving
seizure
and
barring
the
strike,
their
pendency
in
seizure
as
construed
by
the
court
in
this
case.
this
act
does
not
in
any
way
affect
the
rights
of
either
the
employer
or
the
employee
into
safety.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
possession,
by
moving
in
you
mean
into
the
offices
of
the
--
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
mr.
rogers,
the
chairman
of
the
state
mediation
board
was
appointed
the
agent
of
that
company
for
the
purpose
of
taking
possession.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
he
didn't
go
in
the
office,
i
don't
think.
i
think
he
went
in
the
office,
but
he
didn't
stay
in
the
office,
let's
put
it
that
way.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
he
appointed
to
the
company
as
an
agent
--
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
the
management
went
on
as
it
had
been.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
sir?
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
in
the
operation
itself,
there
was
no
substantially
real
change.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
i
am
not
aware
of
it,
your
honor.
other
than
the
fact
that
they
were
subject
--
they
knew
they
were
subject
through
the
overriding
control
of
the
governor's
agent.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
no,
your
honor,
they
were
never
subject
to
that.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
they
were
under
the
law,
everyone
is
under
the
law
your
honor,
but
they
were
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
governor's
agent.
the
governor
is
the
one
who
took
possession
and
--
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
call
it
paper,
call
it
what
you
will
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
no,
there
was
technical
--
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
there
was
legal
possession
--
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
there
was
legal
possession.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
but
as
i
say
your
honor,
the
point
i
am
trying
to
stress
to
the
court
is
that
the
act
does
not
require
it
to
be
administered
in
this
manner.
maybe
they
made
a
mistake
in
doing
it
this
way
--
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
i
think
there
is
substantial
difference
your
honor,
because
in
this
case,
the
right
to
strike
is
affected
only
during
the
temporary
emergency
period.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
it
so
happened
in
this
case,
it
never
has
happened
this
long
before.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
you
mean
all
other
cases?
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
it
cannot
last
longer
than
the
strike.
that
is
the
outside
maximum,
but
under
the
decision
of
the
court
in
missouri,
it
should
be
terminated,
possession
should
be
terminated
at
a
prior
date
and
the
union
has
the
right
under
the
opinion
to
request
the
governor
or
the
court
if
the
governor
refuses
to
terminate
the
possession,
if
conditions
are
such
as
no
longer
to
require
state
possession,
if
the
immanency
of
peril,
disaster
and
jeopardy
are
no
longer
there.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
no,
your
honor,
the
important
thing
here
is
the
nature
and
character
of
the
emergency.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
yeah,
i
understand
that
--
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
well
your
honor,
as
i
see
it,
there
is
no
real
way
for
a
state
in
these
circumstances
simply
bypassing
the
law
to
say
that
during
the
pendency
of
an
emergency
there
shall
be
no
strike
because
there
must
be
some
means
of
first
determining
the
existence
of
the
emergency.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
well,
that
in
effect
is
what
was
done
here.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
yes,
your
honor.
the
important
thing
here
is
that
this
act
was
enacted
under
the
police
power
of
the
state
to
protect
the
public
interest.
and
we
feel
that
no
law
enacted
under
the
police
power
for
that
purpose
should
be
deemed
to
be
preempted
by
any
federal
statute
unless
there
is
some
specific
express
mandate
in
the
federal
statute,
which
would
so
require.
and
in
this
case,
where
the
statute
--
as
the
statue
does,
sorry
the
red
light
is
on.
mr.
joseph
nessenfeld
there
were
a
statute,
as
this
statute
your
honors
limits
the
right
to
strike
solely
to
the
extent
of
an
emergency,
not
an
ordinary
emergency,
not
any
emergency
created
by
any
utility
strike
and
not
any
emergency
resulting
from
the
interruption
of
services,
but
an
emergency
of
such
a
nature,
of
such
a
drastic
nature
as
to
impair
to
a
drastic
extent
and
place
the
public
health,
welfare
and
safety
of
the
public
in
imminent
jeopardy
and
in
those
circumstances,
those
limited
circumstances
holding
unlike
the
wisconsin
in
which
any
utility
strike
constituted
an
emergency
irrespective
of
jeopardy.
and
this
--
in
these
particular
--
in
this
type
of
case,
where
the
emergency
is
such
that
it
must
be
as
such
to
pose
a
threat
of
imminent
disaster
to
the
public
and
that
type
of
case
the
state
must
be
held
not
to
be
helpless
because
otherwise
it
is
no
man's
land,
no
one
can
act
–
shall
--
the
answer
is
that
rome
shall
burn
while
nero
is
fiddling,
that's
the
effect
of
it
is.
if
the
state
can't
act,
if
the
state
is
rendered
impotent
and
helpless
to
protect
its
citizens
in
the
event
of
some
dire
drastic
emergency,
let's
say
not
in
this
particular
case,
but
what
if
it
were
of
drastic
nature,
so
the
state
can't
act
at
all
as
is
the
position
of
the
appellants
here.
and
i
say
that
something
is
wrong
and
i
don't
think
that
congress
could
conceivably
have
intended
by
the
mere
enactment
of
the
labor
relations
management
act
to
have
taken
over
the
field
to
such
an
extent
that
the
state
has
rendered
completely
helpless
to
protect
its
citizens
by
exercising
its
police
power.
thank
you.
