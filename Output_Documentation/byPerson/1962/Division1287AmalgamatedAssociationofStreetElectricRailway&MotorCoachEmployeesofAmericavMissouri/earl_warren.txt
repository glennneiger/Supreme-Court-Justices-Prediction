chief
justice
earl
warren

this
labor
dispute
been
settled?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
changed
the
conditions,
what
were
the
changed
conditions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
said
there
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
the
question
of
moot
depends
entirely
upon
the
decision
of
the
governor
for
undisclosed
reasons?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
that
they
decided
to
strike
tomorrow
would
the
governor
be
--
would
it
be
open
to
the
governor
to
seize
the
company
again?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
were
the
stated
grounds
for
the
emergency?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there

that?
chief
justice
earl
warren

show?
chief
justice
earl
warren

have
the
facts
disclosed
here
in
the
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
just
said
to
me
that
the
court
had
determined
on
the
evidence
that
there
was
such
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
merely
ask
you,
what
is
the
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
kind
of
confusion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
were
to
prevail
in
this
case
and
immediately
thereafter
the
union
has
struck?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
conditions
would
not
be
available
now
to
justify
the
governor's
action
that
existed
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
you
said
that
it's
all
because
of
the
change
in
conditions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
ask
what
conditions
would
have
been
changed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
state
operate
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
affirmative
act
of
operation
did
it
use?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
change
in
personnel
or
any
direction
of
the
company
by
the
governor
or
his
agents?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
is
it
done
on
the
other
occasions,
when
he
seized
the
company?
did
the
state
on
any
of
those
other
occasions
operate
the
company?
chief
justice
earl
warren
14
months
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
