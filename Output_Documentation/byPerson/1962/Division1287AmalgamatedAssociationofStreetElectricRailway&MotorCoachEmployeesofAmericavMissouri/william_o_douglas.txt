justice
william
o.
douglas
i
notice
that
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
this
case
was
filed
on
november
20th
and
that
his
order
was
entered
on
december
28th?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
that
we
noted
jurisdiction
three
days,
after
three
days
or
before
or
three
days
after
i
guess
it
was.
justice
william
o.
douglas
his
order
became
effective.
i
wonder
if
there
is
an
element
of
a
contest
here?
