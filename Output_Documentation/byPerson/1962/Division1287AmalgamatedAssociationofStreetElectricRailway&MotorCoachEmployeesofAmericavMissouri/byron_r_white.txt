justice

well,
what
is
an
employer
--
an
employer
or
somebody
who
is
paid
among
other
things?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
didn't
pay
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
--
what
you
are
saying
is
the
state
is
excluded
from
being
an
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
inclusion
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
you
put
no
weight
on
the
exclusion?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
point
is
that
typically
the
incident
and
this
comes
down
to
the
emergency?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
doesn't
fall
within
any
express
language
in
the
act?
you
are
asking
us
to
construe
the
act
in
a
--
add
another
exception
to
it,
as
well
as
to
add
to
the
exception
which
covers
state
as
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
potentially
that
was
your
intention
with
concerted
activities
with
the
act
expressly?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
act
expressly
says
nothing
shall
interfere
with
the
right
to
strike.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
otherwise
the
hearing
provided,
the
word
is
otherwise
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
the
state
takes
possession
in
the
name
of
what
it
ceases
to
be
a
public
emergency
situation,
the
right
to
strike
should
give
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
the
employers
in
these
situations
would
still
be
subject
to
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
if
they
interfered
with
the
right
to
strike
even
in
those
situations?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
i
suppose,
the
company's
taxes
went
on
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
company's
property
tax
liability
went
on
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
the
strike
is
over
â€“-
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
that
is
