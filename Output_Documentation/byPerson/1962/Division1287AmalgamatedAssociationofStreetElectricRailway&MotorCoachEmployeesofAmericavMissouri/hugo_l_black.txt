justice
hugo
l.
black
what
real
change
was
there
in
the
operation
itself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
anything
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
were
subject
to
that
under
the
law,
before
that
happened,
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
you
had
the
power
to
pass
it,
put
them
under
supervision
[inaudible]
they
were
under
the
law,
weren't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
the
governor
is
the
one
that
on
paper
took
possession.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
was
there
anything
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
to
be
met
on
what
it
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
it's
all
right,
maybe
it's
all
right,
but
that's
all
in
one
assessment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
there
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
is
a
question
of
whether
that's
right
and
whether
that
violated
the
labor
act,
under
the
preemptive
field,
it
is
a
different
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
difference
is
the
[inaudible]
that
the
state
of
missouri
passing
the
law
and
saying,
you
shall
not
strike
and
saying
you
shall
not
strike,
at
the
same
time
delivered
a
paper
to
somebody
and
said,
we
take
legal
or
theoretical
fictional
possession.
what's
the
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
not
have
had
precise
to
the
same
defense,
whatever
it
is,
if
missouri
simply
passed
the
law
and
said
that
during
an
emergency
period
of
the
public
utility,
for
that
could
be
closed
by
a
strike,
with
great
interest
of
the
public
welfare,
there
should
be
no
strike.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
that
but
you
could
have
the
emergency
without
going
through
the
paper
operations.
it
may
be
that
you
have
a
right
under
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
suppose
the
law
said
that
during
--
the
governor
is
hereby
given
the
right
to
determine
whether
there
is
an
emergency
which
will
affect
the
people
adversely
in
connection
with
the
public
utility
and
to
declare
that
there
is
one,
when
he
does
so
declare,
there
shall
be
no
strike
during
an
emergency.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
is
right,
that's
what
i
wanted
you
to
discuss
forgetting
the
fictiional
transfer.
