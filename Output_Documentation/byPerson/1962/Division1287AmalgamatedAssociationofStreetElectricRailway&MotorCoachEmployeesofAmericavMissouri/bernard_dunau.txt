mr.
bernard
dunau
may
it
please
the
court?
a
missouri
statute
known
as
the
king-thomson
act
provides
that
when
the
governor
of
the
state
determines
that
an
actual
or
threatened
strike
by
a
union
against
the
utility
jeopardizes
the
public
interest,
health
and
welfare,
the
governor
is
authorized
to
take
possession
of
the
utility.
if
the
utility
is
taken
over,
the
statute
makes
unlawful
any
strike
to
enforce
demands
against
the
utility
or
against
the
state.
our
principle
question
is
whether
the
king-thompson
act,
which
prohibits
a
strike
to
enforce
demands
during
seizure
is
in
conflict
with
and
therefore
preempted
by
the
labor
management
relations
act,
which
protects
the
right
to
strike
and
to
bargain
collectively,
of
which
the
right
to
strike
is
an
indispensable
part.
now
our
question
arises
in
these
circumstances.
the
utility
here
is
the
kansas
city
transit,
inc.
it's
an
interstate
enterprise,
which
transports
passengers
by
bus
in
and
between
the
states
of
kansas
and
missouri.
in
1943,
the
national
labor
relations
board
certified
the
appellant
union
as
the
bargaining
representative
of
bus
drivers,
mechanics
and
others
who
worked
for
the
company.
since
1943
collective
bargaining
agreements
have
been
entered
into
between
the
utility
and
the
union
governing
the
employment
terms
of
these
persons.
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
due
to
expire
on
october
31,
1961.
negotiations
began
in
the
fall
of
that
year
looking
towards
improved
contract
terms.
an
impasse
ensued.
the
deadlock
was
over
wages,
paid
vacations,
group
insurance
and
other
such
bread
and
butter
issues.
unable
to
resolve
the
deadlock,
and
the
company
refusing
to
agree
to
voluntary
arbitration
of
new
contract
terms,
the
men
voted
to
strike.
the
strike
was
to
begin
at
midnight
november
13,,
1961.
three
days
before
the
strike
was
to
begin
the
union
notified
all
concerned
of
the
time
it
would
start.
on
november
13th
the
same
day
that
the
strike
was
to
begin,
the
governor
of
missouri
issued
a
proclamation
in
which
he
stated
that
the
threatened
strike
would
jeopardize
the
public
interest,
health
and
welfare
and
he
was
there
for
taking
over
the
utility.
taking
over
the
utility
meant
no
more
than
that
the
agent
of
the
governor
deliver
to
the
president
of
the
company
this
proclamation
and
two,
implementing
executive
orders.
nothing
changed
as
a
consequence
of
the
takeover.
the
employees
remained
as
they
were
employees
of
the
company.
they
did
not
become
employees
of
the
state.
mr.
bernard
dunau
nothing
changed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
one
change,
which
took
place
was
that
by
operation
of
law
the
strike
was
prohibited.
as
a
matter
of
fact
nothing
changed
other
than
to
prohibit
that
strike.
the
employment
relationship
continued
to
be
within
the
exclusive
dominion
of
the
company.
mr.
bernard
dunau
all
the
statute
says
as
i
read
it,
is
that
the
state
takes
possession.
it
does
not
in
anyway
detail
what
constitutes
possession
or
what
the
governor
might
do
if
he
took
possession.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
case
we
know
that,
that
what
happened
is
that
nothing
happened
except
that
the
strike
was
prohibited.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir
it
takes
effect
by
virtue
of
the
provision
of
the
statute
which
says
it
shall
be
unlawful,
skipping
some
words,
to
strike
after
any
plant,
equipment
or
facility
has
been
taken
over
by
the
state
under
this
chapter
as
means
of
enforcing
any
demands
against
the
utility
or
against
the
state.
mr.
bernard
dunau
this
is
quite
independent
of
what
would
happen
if
you
had
a
true
civil
service
situation.
this
is
a
situation
in
which
a
private
utility
employing
private
employees
is
taken
over
by
what
i
call
a
paper
possession
in
which
nothing
happens
except
by
virtue
of
the
statute
the
right
to
strike
is
forbidden
during
the
period
of
seizure.
the
company
continues
to
operate
as
it
has
done
before
completely
on
it's
own.
the
officers
and
the
board
of
directors
make
their
own
decisions,
the
state
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
what
happens
and
all
that
happens
is
that
seizure
means
that
you
cannot
strike
during
the
period
of
seizure.
the
men
nevertheless
struck.
they
struck
for
two
days.
the
strike
was
peaceful
and
the
picketing
was
peaceful.
at
the
end
of
the
two
days
as
a
result
of
the
issuance
of
a
temporary
restraining
order
which
eventuated
into
a
permanent
injunction
against
the
strike,
the
strike
was
discontinued.
now
if
this
were
a
strike
by
bakers
or
miners
or
autoworkers
there
would
be
no
doubt
under
the
sun
that
the
state
could
not
enter
such
an
injunction,
this
would
be
activity
protected
by
the
federal
act
and
no
state
can
prohibit
what
the
federal
act
protects.
and
so
it
seems
to
us
that
what
this
case
comes
down
to
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
the
word,
a
strike
by
genuine
state
employees
that
the
state
could
not
prohibit
a
strike
by
state
employees.
the
federal
government
prohibits
a
strike
by
federal
employees.
i
think
there
would
be
no
substantial
question
that
the
state
could
prohibit
a
strike
by
state
employee.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
correct
sir.
in
the
case
of
true
governmental
ownership
and
operation
this
--
the
labor
relations
would
be
outside
the
scope
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
and
we
would
have
no
problem,
but
a
constitutional
problem
and
very
little
of
a
constitutional
problem
i
should
think.
as
i
was
saying,
if
this
were
a
strike
by
bankers,
miners,
autoworkers,
it
wouldn't
be
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
state
couldn't
prohibit
it.
and
so
it
seems
to
us
that
our
question
comes
down
to,
does
it
make
a
difference
that
instead
of
just
being
a
strike
of
bankers,
autoworkers
or
miners,
it
is
a
strike
of
bus
drivers
and
mechanics
working
for
a
transit
company.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
court
answered
that
question
12
years
ago
in
amalgamated
association
versus
the
wisconsin
employment
relations
board,
when
this
court
said,
that
public
utility
workers
just
like
any
other
class
of
workers
covered
by
the
federal
act
enjoy
all
the
protections
of
the
federal
act
and
the
state
cannot
do
anything
to
prohibit
that
which
the
federal
act
protects.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
permits
a
state
to
engage
in
mediation
activities,
but
it
is
our
position
it
does
not
permit
the
state
to
engage
in
mediation
activities
under
standards
which
conflict
with
those
which
are
prescribed
by
the
federal
act
for
mediation.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
maybe
done
all
the
time
but
if
it's
challenged
legally
i
think
it's
erroneous,
it's
wrong.
mr.
bernard
dunau
they
are
certainly
not
within
the
traditional
role
of
mediators
as
used
in
the
taft-hartley
act
when
even
in
a
national
emergency
dispute,
when
the
president
convenes
a
board
of
inquiry
to
look
into
the
dispute,
the
statute
is
explicit
that
the
board
of
inquiry
may
make
no
recommendations.
the
statute
affirmatively
withholds
the
power
to
make
such
recommendations.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
correct
sir,
yes
sir.
this
is
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
key
part
of
this
statute
with
which
we
are
concerned
with
here
is
the
seizure
no
strike
device.
the
other
part
comes
into
play
as
a
consequence
of
the
state's
argument
that
this
is
not
a
comprehensive
statute
and
for
that
reason
it's
different
from
the
wisconsin
act,
which
this
court
invalidated
12
years
ago.
to
that
argument
we
have
two
answers,
first
we
can't
see
for
the
life
of
us,
why
it
makes
a
difference,
whether
it's
comprehensive
or
cursory.
all
that
it
has
to
be
is
in
conflict
with
the
federal
act
and
if
it's
in
conflict
it's
superseded
whether
it's
short
or
long.
now
our
other
point
is
that
in
our
appendix
to
our
brief
this
non-comprehensive
statute
runs
to
eleven-and-a-half
--
ten-and-a-half
pages,
i
don't
know
what
missouri
tell
us
when
it
writes
a
comprehensive
statute.
this
non-comprehensive
statute
covers
every
aspect
of
the
government
of
the
regulation
of
a
labor
dispute
in
public
utilities.
and
our
point
is
that
not
only
is
this
comprehensive,
but
it
is
comprehensive
in
a
way,
which
conflicts
with
federal
standards
even
in
the
area
of
mediation.
and
i
think
that
there
can
be
a
little
doubt
that
while
the
state
--
the
federal
statute
certainly
contemplates
that
states
may
participate
in
mediation
efforts,
i
think
it
contemplates
that
it
will
participate
in
mediation
efforts
consistently
with
the
standards
of
the
federal
act
and
not
in
conflict
with
them.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
know
what
federal
mediators
and
state
mediators
do
in
the
smoke
of
a
hotel
room,
and
what
they
may
properly
do,
but
they
may
not
properly
conduct
a
hearing,
find
facts,
publish
a
written
report
saying
these
are
the
settlement
terms
we
recommend.
if
any
federal
mediator
does
that
he
is
violating
the
law.
now
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
taft-hartley
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
let
me
illustrate
them
what
the
legislative
history
does
bare
out
mr.
justice
black
--
goldberg.
there
was
a
watchdog
committee
setup
in
the
taft-hartley
act
to
take
a
look
at
the
administration
of
the
taft-hartley
act
for
one
year
after
it
was
enacted
in
1947.
one
of
the
things
that
this
watchdog
committee
spoke
about
was
a
recommendation
that
there
ought
to
be
an
amendment
to
taft-hartley
to
authorize
boards
of
inquiry
to
make
recommendations
instead
of
simply
finding
the
facts.
this
watchdog
committee
then
said
as
to
that
suggestion,
a
further
suggestion
has
been
made
that
the
emergency
board
be
permitted
to
make
recommendations
as
well
as
find
the
facts
in
these
disputes.
that
alternative
to
the
act's
procedures
was
considered
at
length
by
the
committees
who
drafted
the
act
and
rejected
by
them
as
being
in
fact
compulsory
arbitration
with
public
opinion
providing
the
compulsion.
mr.
bernard
dunau
thank
you
sir.
may
it
please
the
court?
the
king-thompson
act
bluntly
identifies
its
point
of
conflict
with
the
national
act.
it
states
in
so
many
words
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
after
a
takeover
of
a
utility
to
strike
as
a
means
of
enforcing
demands
against
the
utility
or
against
the
state.
it
prohibits
a
strike
to
enforce
bargaining
demands.
what
this
court
said
12
years
ago
in
the
amalgamated
association
case
applies
with
precise
equality
to
this
case.
it
would
be
sufficient
to
state
that
the
wisconsin
act
in
forbidding
peaceful
strikes
for
higher
wages
in
industries
covered
by
the
federal
act
has
forbidden
the
exercise
of
rights
protected
by
section
7
of
the
federal
act.
missouri
says,
well,
no
we
are
treating
with
an
emergency
and
that
makes
a
difference,
but
the
same
emergency
with
which
missouri
treats
is
the
situation
which
this
court
said,
wisconsin
could
not
treat
with.
in
the
wisconsin
case
we
had
a
transit
strike
as
we
had
here.
we
had
an
interruption
of
surface
transportation
in
milwaukee,
wisconsin
as
we
had
an
interruption
of
surface
transportation
in
kansas
city,
missouri.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
think
wisconsin
blankets
this
case,
yes
sir.
it
could
hardly
make
a
legal
difference;
there
can
hardly
be
a
legal
difference
between
a
strike
which
interrupts
surface
transportation
in
milwaukee,
and
a
strike
which
interrupts
surface
transportation
in
kansas
city.
now
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
so
long
as
the
state
does
not
choose
to
become
the
owner
and
exclusive
operator
of
that
utility,
i
do
not
see
what
the
state
can
do
by
the
way
of
prohibiting
this
strike
or
curtailing
it
in
any
way
which
would
not
conflict
with
the
federal
act.
mr.
bernard
dunau
my
--
the
implications
of
my
first
part
of
my
statement
is
if
precisely
if
missouri
wants
to
own
and
operate
the
transit
system
in
kansas
city
or
if
the
city
wants
to
own
and
operate
it,
just
as
new
york
city
owns
and
operates
the
subway
systems
then
that
the
situation
is
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
federal
act
and
the
state
can
then
do
as
it
chooses
within
constitutional
limits
with
respect
to
a
strike
in
that
system.
short
of
true
governmental
ownership
and
operation
i
do
not
see
a
way
of
regulating
or
prohibiting
a
strike
of
public
utilities
which
would
not
conflict
with
the
federal
act.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
if
the
end
result
was
a
genuine
permanent
exclusive
ownership
i
do
not
think
that
it
would
make
a
difference
that
the
occasion
for
the
state's
decision
was
a
labor
dispute.
but
i
emphasize
that
it
has
to
be
a
genuine
permanent
taking
over
not
an
ad-hoc
interim
seizure
for
the
purpose
of
getting
over
a
labor
dispute
and
then
a
return
of
the
enterprise
to
private
ownership
or
any
such
stopgap
measure
that
i
think
is
simply
a
crude
camouflage
which
tries
to
conceal
the
conflict
of
the
federal
act
we
cannot
on
a
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct
sir.
i
don't
mean,
for
example
that
a
state
even
if
for
the
period
of
seizure
it
would
operate
it,
but
then
plans
to
turn
the
utility
back
to
the
private
owner
at
the
end
of
the
labor
dispute
that
that
is
the
kind
of
takeover
which
would
be
permitted
under
the
federal
act.
i
mean
that
the
state
owns,
operates,
and
will
continue
so
far
as
one
can
tell
permanently
to
own
and
operate
the
facility.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
now,
in
the
amalgamated
association
case
there
were
two
cases
decided.
the
second
of
the
two
cases
was
one
in
which
wisconsin
sought
to
prohibit
a
strike
interrupting
gas
service.
wisconsin
was
told
it
had
no
power
to
prohibit
a
strike
interrupting
gas
service.
now,
if
we
are
to
indulge
in
comparisons
of
so
called
emergencies,
i
would
suppose
that
a
strike
which
interrupts
gas
service
would
be
more
critical
to
a
community
than
a
transit
strike.
yet,
wisconsin
was
told
it
could
not
prohibit
a
gas
strike.
i
cannot
see
therefore
how
missouri
can
prohibit
a
transit
strike.
now
the
missouri's
argument
seems
to
me
to
be
based
upon
reading
one
part
of
this
court's
decision
and
refusing
to
read
another
part
of
this
court's
decision
in
amalgamated
association.
when
wisconsin
was
arguing
for
the
right
to
regulate
public
utility
strikes
it
said
these
are
local
emergencies
which
should
remain
within
the
police
power
of
the
state.
to
that
argument
the
court
said
two
things.
one,
your
statute
is
not
emergency
legislation
and
two,
it
would
make
no
difference
even
if
it
were.
the
state
concentrates
on
the
first
alternative
and
refuses
to
look
at
what
this
court
said
by
way
of
the
alternative
ground
for
decision.
specifically
what
this
court
said
alternatively
was
in
any
event,
congressional
imposition
of
certain
restrictions
on
petitioner's
right
to
strike
far
from
supporting
the
wisconsin
act
shows
that
congress
has
closed
the
state
regulation,
the
field
of
peaceful
strikes
in
industries
affecting
commerce
and
where
as
here
the
state
seeks
to
deny
entirely
a
federally
guaranteed
right
which
congress
itself
restricted
only
to
a
limited
extent
in
case
of
national
emergencies,
however
serious,
it
is
manifest
that
the
state
legislation
is
in
conflict
with
federal
law.
so
it
seems
to
us
that
this
court
said,
albeit
alternatively
that
you
cannot
enter
this
field
by
labeling
your
situation
an
emergency
and
it
is
old
law
that
where
you
have
alternative
grounds
for
decision
neither
is
obiter,
both
are
authoritative
adjudications.
and,
i
think
the
untenability
of
trying
to
predicate
state
power
on
emergency
is
emphasized
by
the
undisputed
fact
shown
in
this
case
that
the
principal
component
of
this
so
called
emergency
was
that
a
strike
would
curtail
retail
sales
in
downtown
kansas
city.
once
you
start
on
this
emergency
trail
there
is
no
place
you
stop.
the
state
says
well
we
are
different
from
the
wisconsin
statute
because
we
do
not
provide
for
compulsory
arbitration,
that
is
a
difference.
it
is
a
difference
which
it
seems
to
us
and
makes
the
wisconsin
statute
worse,
not
better
from
a
conflict
point
of
view,
because
the
premise
of
the
national
act
is
that
in
order
for
a
union
and
an
employer
to
bargain
as
equals
the
union
must
have
a
right
to
strike.
if
it
does
not
have
a
right
to
strike
bargaining
is
just
talk,
there
is
no
means
by
which
it
can
move
the
employer
to
change
his
position.
wisconsin
took
away
the
right
to
strike,
but
at
least
it
offered
a
substitute
in
place
of
a
compulsory
arbitration.
missouri
takes
away
the
right
to
strike
and
offers
nothing
in
it's
place.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
a
worst
conflict.
it
does
not
ameliorate
the
situation
to
take
away
what
the
federal
act
has
granted
and
to
substitute
nothing
in
its
place.
mr.
bernard
dunau
in
this
specific
case
here
it
was
14
months
that
the
strike
was
prohibited.
in
other
seizure
cases,
seizure
has
lasted
from
about
eight
days
to
a
maximum
of
eight
months.
mr.
bernard
dunau
they
remain
in
status
quo
by
virtue
of
the
executive
order.
mr.
bernard
dunau
collective
bargaining
can
go
on
but
without
the
right
to
strike
which
for
us
makes
collective
bargaining
a
mockery.
you
cannot
bargain
collectively,
you
cannot
do
anything
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
but
yes,
discussions
can
go
on
and
have
in
fact
gone
on
in
this
case.
now
the
state
says,
well
it
makes
a
difference
that
we
seized,
that
we
are
only
prohibiting
the
strike
during
the
period
of
seizure
and
this
differentiates
it
from
the
federal
--
from
the
missouri
--
from
the
wisconsin
situation.
well
just
like
compulsory
arbitration
congress
canvassed
seizure
as
a
method
of
regulating
labor
disputes
and
just
like
compulsory
arbitration,
it
rejected
seizure
as
a
way
of
solving
labor
disputes.
now
i
cannot
put
that
more
succinctly
than
it
was
put
by
this
court
in
mr.
justice
black's
opinion
in
the
steel
seizure
case,
when
this
court
held
that
the
president
could
not
seize
the
steel
mills
to
avert
a
national
emergency
and
predicated
that
judgment
primarily
on
the
fact
that
in
the
taft-hartley
act,
congress
had
withheld
the
power
to
seize
in
order
to
provide
a
means
of
getting
over
a
labor
dispute.
now
specifically
what
was
said
in
that
opinion
is
this,
“the
use
of
a
seizure
technique
to
solve
labor
disputes
in
order
to
prevent
work
stoppages
was
not
only
unauthorized
by
any
congressional
enactment.
prior
to
this
controversy,
congress
had
refused
to
adopt
that
method
of
settling
labor
disputes.
when
the
taft-hartley
act
was
under
consideration
in
1947,
congress
rejected
an
amendment
which
would
have
authorized
such
governmental
seizures
in
cases
of
emergency.
apparently
it
was
thought
that
the
technique
of
seizure
like
that
of
compulsory
arbitration
would
interfere
with
the
process
of
collective
bargaining.
consequently
the
plan
congress
adopted
in
that
act
did
not
provide
for
seizure
under
any
circumstances.
the
power
to
seize
which
congress
withheld
from
the
president
to
avert
a
national
emergency,
it
did
not
grant
to
a
state
governor
to
avert
a
local
emergency.
seizure,
compulsory
arbitration,
any
other
shortcut
to
industrial
peace
was
blocked
by
congress.
congress
said
we
put
our
faith
in
collective
bargaining
backed
by
the
right
to
strike.”
this
court,
12
years
ago
said,
“the
creation
of
a
special
classification
for
public
utilities
is
for
congress,
not
for
this
court.”
it
in
effect
invited
the
people
who
thought
that
there
should
be
state
regulation
or
prohibition
of
public
utility
strikes
to
go
to
congress
and
people
have
been
going
to
congress
ever
since.
bills
have
been
introduced
in
1951,
1954,
1958,
1959
and
then
the
present
session
of
congress
1963,
to
authorize
the
states
to
regulate
or
prohibit
public
utility
strikes.
in
1954,
in
1958
and
1959
those
bills
came
on
for
a
vote
on
the
senate
floor.
in
each
of
those
years
those
bills
were
roundly
defeated.
congress
has
refused
to
authorize
state
intercession
in
this
field,
notwithstanding
this
court's
indication
to
go
to
congress.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
it's
a
good
idea
to
have
state
regulation
of
public
utility
strikes,
the
place
to
make
the
argument
and
to
sell
that
idea
is
across
the
mall,
not
here.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
serious
question
of
mootness
in
this
case.
this
utility
has
been
seized
three
times.
each
time
that
it
has
threatened
to
strike
it
has
been
seized.
this
underlying
labor
dispute
is
still
unresolved.
should
this
union
go
out
on
strike?
every
factory
which
impels
seizure
the
three
previous
times
would
still
operate
to
impel
seizure
a
fourth
time.
it
seems
to
us
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
recurring
threat
of
prohibition
of
the
strike
through
seizure
anytime
this
union
will
go
out
on
strike.
when
you
have
this
kind
of
a
recurring
threat,
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
have
a
mootness,
a
stilling,
a
non-live
controversy.
furthermore,
because
of
the
very
fact
that
these
orders
are
temporary,
temporary
in
the
sense
that
a
labor
dispute
does
not
go
on
forever
and
therefore
seizure
does
not
go
on
forever,
and
by
the
nature
of
a
kind
of
dispute
you
have,
you
can
never
get
to
this
court
in
time
to
test
the
validity
of
the
seizure
if
it's
mere
lifting
will
be
sufficient
to
moot
the
controversy.
in
this
case
we
thought
we
would
finally
make
it,
because
the
men
were
saying
they
were
not
going
to
settle
till
they
had
a
determination
of
their
right
to
strike.
we
held
out,
that
did
us
not
a
one
wit
of
good,
the
governor
then
vacated
seizure,
if
this
controversy
can
be
mooted
by
vacation
of
seizure
it
means
one
can
never
get
to
this
court
to
test
the
validity
of
the
king-thompson
act
so
long
as
you
are
willing
to
comply
with
the
injunction
while
it
is
in
force.
you
have
to
risk
violating
the
injunction,
getting
thrown
in
jail
for
criminal
contempt,
and
that
is
the
only
road
by
which
you
will
get
to
this
court.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
with
a
history
of
recurrent
seizures,
with
the
short-term
orders
which
are
necessarily
involved
with
a
combination
of
recurrence
and
a
short-term
order
is
the
classic
situation
for
saying
that
a
controversy
is
not
mooted.
i
think
the
other
cases
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
the
controversy
was
mooted
by
virtue
of
the
lifting
of
the
seizure.
in
the
two
other
cases,
there
was
an
actual
settlement
of
a
labor
dispute.
here
we
do
not
have
a
settlement
of
the
labor
dispute.
here
we
have
a
real
risk
that
if
the
union
were
to
go
out
on
strike
tomorrow
in
this
labor
dispute,
you
would
have
seizure
tomorrow
unless
the
governor
chose
not
to
because
of
the
existence
of
this
litigation.
now
the
other
thing,
it
seems
to
me
with
respect
to
the
other
two
cases,
as
i
think
it
was
possible
to
say
on
the
records
in
those
cases
that
we
could
awake
a
recurrence,
we
did
not
have
to
anticipate
seizure.
now,
we
did
not
have
to
anticipate
that
there
will
be
a
recurrence.
i
think
that
basis
for
decision
is
no
longer
entertainable.
i
think
this
record
shows
that
unless
this
case
remains
alive
notwithstanding
the
lifting
of
seizure
there
is
no
way
you
can
reach
this
court
to
test
the
validity
of
the
king-thomson
act,
and
i
think
this
court's
decisions
both
in
the
recurrent,
in
the
situations
of
threatened
recurrence
and
in
the
short-term
order
doctrine
have
posed
the
possibility
to
a
wrongdoer
being
able
to
continue
doing
what
he
wants
to
do
and
at
the
point
where
you
can
finally
decide
whether
what
he
is
doing
is
valid
or
invalid,
he
pulls
the
case
out
under
you
by
stopping
what
is
the
challenge
act.
