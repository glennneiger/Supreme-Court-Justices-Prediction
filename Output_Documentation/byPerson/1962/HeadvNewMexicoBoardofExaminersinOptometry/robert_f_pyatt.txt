mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
at
the
bar,
we
understood
that
some
question
arose
concerning
dr.
roberts
which
question
may
have
been
raised
by
mr.
justice
white.
his
honor
would
like
some
clarification
of
that.
i
believe
we
are
prepared
to
do
so,
albeit
the
remarks
would
be
outside
of
the
record.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
no,
your
honor,
he
was
not.
he
did
practice
at
clovis,
new
mexico
at
one
time,
prior
to
going
over
into
texas.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
between
texas
and
new
mexico.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
the
economic
explanation,
i
believe,
your
honor,
is
that
we
might
characterize
that
community
as
cut-rate
row.
i
think
the
businesses
exist
out
there
solely
because
services
and
goods
may
be
sold
cheaper
than
they
can
in
new
mexico.
i
found
that
gasoline
--
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
texas
sales
tax,
your
honor,
is
not
as
high
as
that
of
new
mexico's
sales
tax.
and
on
some
commodity
if
i
understand
the
texas
law
correctly,
it
does
not
impose
the
sales
tax
at
all.
gasoline
is
cheaper
over
there.
they
may
lawfully
sell
fireworks
in
texas
which
you
may
not
lawfully
do
in
new
mexico.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
and
eyeglasses
at
a
discount,
yes
sir.
if
we
correctly
understood,
the
appellant's
counsel
yesterday,
i
believe
he
said
that
the
evil
of
new
mexico
was
action
in
part
is
that
it
results
in
new
mexico
and
texas
residents
both,
not
being
able
to
run
of
the
presence
of
the
dr.
roberts
just
east
of
the
new
mexico
texas
state
line.
now,
if
our
understanding
is
a
correct
one,
i
think
it
should
be
called
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
new
mexico
law
does
not
prohibit
advertising
by
the
optometrist.
he
may
give
an
ad,
advertising
the
fact
that
he
practices
optometry
and
his
location
and
what
have
you.
but
he
may
not
say
cheap
glasses,
glasses
at
a
discount,
and
words
of
similar
import,
so
the
fact
that
his
presence
where
he
now
practiced
may
be
advertised
by
him.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
yes,
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
and
in
our
view
of
the
case,
the
preemption
question
is
the
--
the
most
significant
issue
at
bar.
now,
perhaps
first
of
all
and
therefore
behooves
us
to
examine
that
--
that
the
test
of
preemption
that
this
court
has
laid
down
--
pardon
me.
in
the
huron
portland
case,
it
was
said
that
actual
conflict
which
the
law
of
the
state
determines
whether
or
not
the
field
has
been
preemption
--
preempted.
and
we
would
respectively
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
neither
the
government
nor
the
appellants
have
pointed
out
a
conflict
between
the
new
mexico
optometry
act
and
the
federal
communications
act.
furthermore,
they
have
not
pointed
out
a
conflict
between
the
new
mexico
statute
as
administered
in
this
case
and
any
applicable
regulation
or
rule
of
the
federal
communications
commission.
indeed,
they
conceive
that
some
rule
is
left
to
the
states
to
act
as
against
radio
broadcasters
in
interstate
commerce,
dwelling
greatly
on
kelly
against
washington,
it
was
there
said
that
the
test
preemption
is
whether
or
not
the
state
and
federal
laws
are
in
direct
and
positive
conflict.
we
submit
there
is
underlying
fact
in
this
case.
now,
opponents
rely
heavily
on
the
third
circuit
decision
in
the
dumont
case
wherein
in
all
accounts,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
congress
has
occupied
the
field
but
it
becomes
relevant
to
examine
the
factual
setting
of
the
dumont
case.
and
the
pennsylvania
and
federal
statues
therein
involved.
in
the
first
place,
pennsylvania
had
pure
and
simply
set
out
on
a
program
of
censorship.
it
required
submission
of
films
to
be
used
in
televising
to
a
board
of
censors
prior
to
showing
them.
the
pennsylvania
act
was
thus
directed
at
broadcasting
as
such.
new
mexico's
act
is
entirely
different.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
government's
argument
presupposes
here
in
this
case
that
new
mexico
has
set
about
upon
a
scheme
of
regulating
the
radio
industry.
but
that
is
it
not
yet
at
all
if
we
may
say
so.
we
have
set
upon
a
scheme
of
public
health
regulation
in
particular,
the
human
eyesight,
which
this
court
sustained
in
williams.
the
federal
statutes
involved
in
the
dumont
decision
where
those
treating
of
license
suspension
for
indecent
or
false
transmission,
and
the
criminal
sanctions
for
doing
the
same
thing.
hence,
there
was
a
clash
with
the
pennsylvania
statutes,
which
i
assume,
were
designed
to
prevent
the
pennsylvania
residents
from
the
seeing
suggestive
or
indecent
television
programs.
now,
it
is
in
this
context
that
the
court
will
speak
when
in
dumont,
it
said,
that
congress
has
occupied
the
field
and
when
it
said
that
what
congress
has
done
is
to
enact
an
effective
remedy.
here,
we
are
concerned
with
truthful
advertising,
not
false
advertising,
and
certainly
obscene
utterances
formed
no
part
on
this
picture.
furthermore
--
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
remedy
of
criminal
prosecution
was
open
to
the
state
under
those
facts
against
to
both
the
radio
and
the
newspaper
of
course.
however,
it
seemed
to
us
at
the
time
that
the
civil
proceeding
of
injunction
would
be
more
effective
for
one
reason.
the
criminal
prosecution
of
course
would
--
or
could
in
tie
--
entail
repeated
prosecution
for
each
utterance.
of
course,
that
is
extremely
harsh
for
one
thing
and
it's
extremely
expensive
on
the
state
to
bring
criminal
prosecution
after
criminal
prosecution
if
the
broadcaster
persists
in
promulgating
the
prohibited
advertising.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
well
--
but
not
for
very
long
justice
goldberg.
again,
as
much
the
offenses
of
misdemeanor
and
not
a
fe
--
felony
under
new
mexico
law.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
well,
yes
sir
but
not
for
as
long
a
time
as
for
a
felony
conviction.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
in
the
example
that
you
profound
to
us
mr.
justice
black,
i
do
not
think
that
new
mexico
could
enforce
a
law
which
said
certain
kind
of
pictures
could
not
be
shown
even
though
not
obscene
because
there,
we
would
be
in
conflict
with
section
326
of
the
communications
act
which
prohibits
censorship.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
yes
sir,
by
the
commission.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
no
sir,
let
me
explain.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
mr.
justice
black,
that
is
true.
perhaps,
i
might
explain
it
this
way.
we
believe
that
censorship
is
the
other
side
of
the
free
speech
coin.
in
other
words,
a
situation
like
you
had
in
near
versus
minnesota.
on
the
other
hand,
when
you
have
a
situation
involving
commercial
advertising
as
we
now
have
at
bar,
we
have
something
akin
to
the
valentine
versus
chrestensen
case.
in
those
situations,
that
is
dealing
with
commercial
advertising,
like
the
court
had
in
railway
express
versus
new
york,
we
believe
that
the
states
may
prohibit
cert
--
prohibit
that
commercial
advertising
when
as
in
the
williamson
case,
there
is
a
sufficient
police
power
basis
to
do
so.
now,
interestingly
enough,
the
dumont
decision
was
decided
by
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals.
subsequent
to
that
decision,
that
same
court
decided
the
case
of
felix
versus
westinghouse
at
186
f2.d
1,
in
which
it
held
that
the
pennsylvania
libel
law
was
upheld
as
against
a
broadcaster
for
remarks,
which
were
libelous,
uttered
by
a
candidate's
campaign
manager.
in
other
words,
the
third
circuit
restricted
the
application
of
section
315
of
the
communications
act
to
speeches
uttered
by
the
candidate
himself.
so,
one
wonders
if
--
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
it
was
felix
versus
westinghouse,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
no,
sir
it
is
not.
it
is
at
186
f.2d
1
and
was
decided
by
the
third
circuit.
so,
one
wonders
if
that
court
in
its
subsequent
decisions
still
entertain
the
same
view
that
the
communications
act
had
occupied
the
field
as
it
stated
in
the
dumont
decision.
this
court
has
decided
the
case
of
radio
station
wow
against
johnson
in
which
it
upheld
an
action
by
the
nebraska
supreme
court
in
which
the
nebraska
court
had
decree
a
retransfer
of
licensed
facilities
on
a
finding
a
fraud
conceding
of
the
--
the
nebraska
court
of
course,
conceded
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
to
order
a
retransfer
of
the
license
itself.
now,
as
this
court
stated,
the
result
of
the
johnson
case
could
well
have
been
termination
of
the
broadcasting
decision.
yet,
it
was
stated
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
federal
communications
act
dislodging
the
power
of
the
states
to
deal
with
fraud
simply
because
a
licensed
broadcaster
was
involved.
now,
we
submit
that
by
the
same
token,
there
is
nothing
in
the
federal
communications
act
dislodging
the
power
of
the
states
to
deal
with
the
health
question
of
this
import.
in
johnson,
it
was
held
that
the
public
interest
which
the
commission
must
protect
is
involved
in
granting
licenses
which
can
hardly
imply
that
state
laws
are
nullified.
now,
we
submit
that
state
laws
on
health
by
the
same
line
of
reason
have
not
been
nullified
simply
because
licensed
facilities
are
being
used
as
instruments
for
thwarting
a
legitimate
public
health
policy
of
the
state
or
is
it
amiss
to
consider
the
impact
of
the
state
action,
first
and
foremost,
is
that
in
johnson
termination
of
the
station
was
possible.
there
is
nothing
like
that
present
in
the
case
at
bar.
it
becomes
important
from
a
practical
standpoint,
and
that
the
appellant
permian
does
not
even
show
anywhere
in
the
record
in
this
cause
that
the
prohibition
of
running
these
ads
entails
a
loss
of
revenue
to
it.
now,
it
is
also
the
impact
of
the
state
action
affirm
the
federal
agencies'
regulatory
tasks,
that
must
be
considered
in
determining
the
issue
of
preemption,
not
whether
as
the
government
says.
the
state
action
involves
a
traditional
or
well-known,
or
common
law
remedy
or
whether
the
state
action
involves
modern
day
concepts
of
health
or
welfare
or
social
legislation.
now,
the
appellants
and
the
united
states
failed
utterly
to
show
how
the
decree
would
interfere
with
federal
communications
commission
duties.
the
obedience
of
this
decree
by
the
appellant
permian
will
not
entail
disobedience
by
permian
of
any
rule
or
regulation
of
the
commission
or
of
any
statute
of
the
united
states.
and
furthermore,
the
united
states
fails
to
cite
authority
for
its
assertive
distinction
between
traditional
common
law
remedies
on
the
one
hand
which
they
state
--
which
they
say
the
state
may
impose,
and
the
enforcement
of
public
remedies
under
health
legislation
on
the
other
hand,
which
the
government
says,
the
state
may
not
impose.
regents
versus
carroll
decided
by
this
court,
is
a
great
interest,
for
there,
there
was
a
clutch
between
the
state
action
and
the
federal
action.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
stock
purchase
contract
involved.
the
federal
communications
commission
required
repudiation
by
the
broadcaster
of
that
stock
purchase
contract
prior
to
a
renewal
of
the
license.
on
the
other
hand,
the
georgia
courts
enforced
the
contract
and
awarded
monetary
damages
in
the
amount
of
a
$145,000.00
which
state
action
this
court
upheld.
now,
the
language
of
the
opinion
is
interesting,
and
that
this
court
said
that
it
realized
that
it
was
upholding
a
state
judgment
which
in
effect
nullified
a
communications
commission
order,
stating
that
what
it
was
doing
was
out
of
proper
regard
for
both
the
federal
and
state
interest.
now,
the
state
interest
there
of
course
were
--
was
to
uphold
the
sanctity
of
contracts
entered
into
in
that
state.
here,
the
state
action
is
far
more
significant,
we
think,
far
more
important
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
human
eyesight,
a
legitimate
health
measure
is
involved
nor
is
there
any
risk
in
the
present
case
that
an
affirmance
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
would
in
effect
nullify
a
commission
order.
there
is
--
there
is
no
risk
of
that
here
as
certainly
there
was
in
the
carroll
case.
i
think
it's
highly
important
to
consider
the
results
of
a
holding
that
the
field
has
been
preempted
in
this
case.
if
this
court
should
agree
with
the
government
and
hold
that
the
field
has
been
preempted,
then
new
mexico
and
49
other
states
are
powerless
to
deal
with
this
kind
of
bait
and
switch
advertising
which
may
be
run
over
a
radio.
not
only
is
that
true
in
the
field
of
optometry
but
it
would
be
true
in
the
field
of
dentistry,
it
would
be
true
in
the
field
of
medicine,
and
even
inconceivable
though
it
might
sound,
in
the
field
of
law.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
justice
black,
i
think
not.
i
do
not
believe
that
new
mexico
could
prohibit,
let
us
say,
a
newspaper
in
arizona
from
running
price
advertising
of
glasses.
i
don't
think
we
could
prevent
either
that
--
that
publication
in
arizona
or
the
entrance
of
that
paper
from
arizona
into
the
state
of
new
mexico.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
i
had
assumed
justice
black's
question,
justice
white,
was
as
to
the
sale
of
glasses
in
arizona.
if
it
--
if
it
advertised
that
those
glasses
could
be
sold
in
violation
of
the
price
advertising
features
of
our
act
in
arizona
--
or
in
new
mexico,
then
under
those
conditions,
i
think
new
mexico
would
have
a
sufficient
basis
to
exclude
that
paper
from
new
mexico.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
yes
sir,
the
wilson
act,
it
did,
justice
black.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
yes
sir,
there
was
--
not
by
this
court
unfortunately,
that
i
can
recall
at
the
moment.
in
our
brief,
we
cite
the
case
of
solomon
--
the
solomon
case.
it
was
an
indiana
decision
which
the
--
there
was
a
local
ordinance
which
the
indiana
courts
upheld
excluding
newspapers
from
coming
into
that
city
which
advertise
horseracing
contrary
to
local
law.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
that
was
under
an
act
of
congress.
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
mr.
justice
black,
i
apologize.
i
don't
recall
either.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
i
don't
recall
either,
whether
this
court
struck
it
down
and
then
the
congress
had
to
render
the
enactment,
make
the
enactment,
or
whether
there
was
no
adverse
decision
prior
to
--
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
indeed
there
was.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
yes
sir,
it
was.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
if
this
--
if
this
comparable
situation
were
present,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
think
it
would
--
i
think
it
would
apply
because
--
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
no,
to
be
sure,
it
is
not
and
perhaps
it
doesn't
--
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
well,
there
your
honor,
we
would
of
course
not
have
the
health
measure
to
rest
upon.
but
it
is
my
theory
that
new
mexico
could
enforce
that
law,
the
basis
i
believe
you'd
say
for
the
limitation
upon
the
number
of
items
that
may
be
advertised,
is
all
part
and
parcel
of
new
mexico's
fair
trade
law.
and
there,
i
think
we
have
a
constitutional
basis
for
enforcing
the
provisions
of
the
fair
trade
law
including
the
advertising
sections.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
your
honor,
i
must
confess
that
i
do
not
know
the
effect
of
an
act
of
congress
pertaining
to
the
enforcement
by
the
states
of
its
fair
trade
laws.
i
do
not
know.
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
black.
i
cannot
answer
the
court's
question
there.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
i
believe
we
could
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
in
the
case
of
kroeger
versus
stahl
which
again
was
a
decision
by
the
third
circuit
and
which
followed
the
dumont
case
and
the
felix
case,
the
radio
station
owner
therein
contended
that
enforcement
of
the
local
zoning
ordinance
which
prohibited
--
had
the
effect
of
prohibiting
the
erection
of
radio
station
in
a
zone
restricted
to
residential
purposes,
conflicted
with
the
communications
act.
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
sufficient,
in
that
case,
since
that
supersession
in
that
case,
since
there
was
no
direct
and
positive
conflict
between
the
communications
act
and
the
zoning
ordinance.
now,
the
practical
effect
of
the
stahl
case
was
highly
significant.
it
prevented
the
erection
of
a
radio
station
for
broadcasting
which
had
to
have
an
effect
upon
the
content
of
programs.
it
is
also
interesting
from
this
standpoint
that
the
case
of
kroeger
against
stahl
involved
in
instance
where
a
state
was
permitted
to
enforce
not
a
traditional
common
law
remedy
but
rather
a
modern
day
regulatory
concept,
namely
zoning.
furthermore,
we
submit
that
sight
should
not
be
lost
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
sanders
brothers
case
since
therein
it
was
said
that
program
control
is
not
given
to
the
federal
communications
commission
as
such.
in
other
words,
the
sanders
case
pursuant
to
section
326
of
the
act
said
that
there
shall
be
no
program
control
by
the
communications
commission.
now
--
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
no,
sir.
if
i
am
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
am
reasonably
sure
on
myself
on
this,
section
326
has
not
been
amended
since
the
sanders
case
was
decided.
in
any
event,
section
326
is
still
on
the
books,
you
may
say,
and
certainly
does
not
change
the
effect
of
the
sanders
decision
in
that
respect.
now,
a
large
argument
of
the
united
states
is
that
programs
and
advertising
are
to
be
considered
by
the
federal
communications
commission
in
either
in
application,
a
renewal,
or
a
revocation
proceeding.
now,
that
does
not
exclude
state
jurisdiction
of
the
type
attempted
to
be
asserted
here.
if,
as
the
government
suggests,
the
commission
on
a
renewal
proceeding
would
give
consideration
to
whether
or
not
the
state
law
had
been
obeyed,
it
has
been
conceded
by
the
solicitor
general
that
that
is
just
one
factor
out
of
a
great
many
that
would
be
pertinent
or
relevant
in
the
renewal
proceeding.
and
even
if
the
commission
were
to
look
into
the
question
of
whether
there
had
been
obedience
by
the
broadcaster
to
state
law,
it
would
of
course
have
to
refer
back
to
the
state
law.
there
would
be
no
conflict
in
a
case
like
that.
there
would
be
no
preemption.
rather,
there
would
be
a
reference.
now,
it's
--
it's
been
mentioned
by
the
solicitor
general
before
the
bar
that
even
if
there
had
been
a
few
isolated
instances
of
disobedience
by
the
broadcaster
which
came
to
light
in
a
renewal
proceeding,
it
would
nonetheless
be
quite
doubtful
if
the
commissioner
would
refuse
under
those
conditions
to
renew
the
license.
it
therefore,
as
a
practical
matter,
falls
back
upon
the
states
where
these
health
measures
have
rested
traditionally.
furthermore,
the
government
conceives
that
the
communications
act
does
not
broadly
withdraw
from
the
states
the
power
to
redress
private
wrongs
since
the
act
contains
no
remedial
provisions
for
private
persons.
but
the
same
is
equally
true
of
public
wrongs.
the
act
contains
no
provisions
permitting
the
redress
of
public
wrongs
by
the
states,
either
for
violation
of
health
measures
or
otherwise.
aside
from
the
question
of
preemption
in
the
huron
case,
the
ship
owner
therein
argued
that
uniformity
was
necessary
by
virtue
of
the
commerce
clause
itself
even
absent
a
preemption.
and
this
court
held
that
what
was
enacted
there
by
the
city
of
detroit
was
a
legitimate
health
measure.
now,
here
in
new
mexico
centers
is
that
of
eyesight.
detroit
centers
was
in
map
of
pure
air,
but
the
effect
of
detroit's
action
upon
interstate
commerce
could
certainly
have
been
more
disruptive
or
potentially
more
disruptive
of
uniformity
than
the
action
of
new
mexico
in
the
case
at
bar,
for
the
simple
fact
was
that
alterations
in
the
ship's
structures
would
have
been
necessary
in
order
to
comply
with
the
smoke
abatement
code.
those
ships
necessarily
had
to
touch
at
other
ports
upon
the
great
lakes.
potentially,
there
was
a
disruption
of
uniformity
because
other
ports
could
have
had
different
requirements
as
to
the
smoke,
the
abatement
of
smoke.
here,
the
appellants
are
only
amenable
to
one
law
and
that
is
new
mexico.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
oh,
i
--
no,
i
wasn't
suggesting
that,
justice
stewart.
but
another
port
could
have
had
more
stringent
smoke
abatement
requirements
than
did
the
port
of
detroit.
that,
that
was
all
i
meant
to
suggest
there.
new
mexico's
action
is
essentially
low.
it
has
not
set
out
to
regulate
broadcasting.
it
has
not
set
out
to
regulate
newspapers.
it
has
enacted
a
measure
which
in
this
--
which
has
this
court
has
held
in
williams.
it's
perfectly
proper.
the
fact
that
interstate
commerce
is
involved
at
all
in
the
case
at
bar
is
purely
incidental.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
panhandle
eastern
gas
line
versus
michigan
public
service
commission,
there
the
court
said
that
congress
had
only
occupied
a
limited
field
in
the
entire
scope
of
regulating
the
natural
gas
industry
and
the
transmission
of
natural
gas.
in
other
words,
it
had
not
legislated
on
the
subject
of
direct
sales
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
and
hence,
there
was
left
a
certain
amount
of
room
for
state
regulation.
this
court
said
that
there
was
no
preemption
because
there
were
no
opposing
directives.
now,
that
may
be
said
equally
here.
there
is
no
opposing
--
there
is
no
directive
in
the
communications
act
as
to
professional
advertising
--
true,
false
or
otherwise.
so
you
don't
have
the
situation
of
opposing
directives
which
the
court
held
in
panhandle
was
the
test
of
preemption.
aside
from
the
question
of
preemption,
the
sales
in
panhandle
were
matters
of
local
concern.
hence,
the
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
could
have
--
was
required
by
the
state
of
michigan
of
panhandle
before
it
could
engage
in
the
sales
to
the
consumers.
now,
that
is
severe
state
action
which
this
court
upheld
there
for
the
power
to
require
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
comes
awfully
close
to
the
power
to
prohibit
activity
all
together
by
the
gas
company.
but
we
find
inconceivable
to
believe
that
eye
care
is
of
less
concern
and
the
states
are
less
brave
to
act
in
that
field
and
in
public
utility
regulation.
indeed,
the
balancing
of
the
interest
over
the
state
and
the
nation
in
this
case
gives
rise
to
a
situation
where
the
need
for
the
state
to
be
free
to
act
barely
cries
out
for
an
affirmative.
this
is
a
matter
that
has
been
traditionally
left
to
the
state,
public
health.
congress
may
never
act.
indeed,
i
think
it's
safe
to
say
that
congress
may
never
even
want
to
act
or
concern
itself
with
it,
but
it
falls
back
upon
the
states.
now,
if
this
court
holds
that
preemption
has
occurred,
then
the
states
are
powerless
to
prohibit
this
form
of
advertising
over
the
radio.
the
appellants
placed
great
stress
upon
the
case
of
baldwin
versus
seelig
in
the
aspects
of
interstate
commerce.
we
do
not
believe
that
case
was
in
point.
there,
new
york
had
said,
“you
can't
bring
this
milk
in
into
new
york
unless
you
have
paid
in
vermont
the
same
price
you
would
have
had
to
have
paid
in
the
state
of
new
york.”
we
do
not
say
that
a
newspaper
originating
in
texas
cannot
come
into
new
mexico.
we
do
not
say
--
perhaps
more
apropos,
we
do
not
say
that
a
radio
station
in
texas
could
not
promulgate
this
form
of
advertising,
even
though
subsequently
heard
in
the
state
of
new
mexico.
but
what
we
do
suggest
that
the
local
regulation
of
this
advertising
is
permissible
to
new
mexico
because
the
cert
--
the
health
of
its
citizens
are
involved.
it
is
what
new
mexico
residents
here
in
new
mexico
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
and
certainly,
local
regulation
of
advertising,
even
though
that
advertising
is
interstate
is
on
no
higher
plane
than
anything
else.
for
example,
there
is
the
case
of
railway
express
agency
versus
new
york
city.
there
is
--
you
can't
dismiss,
as
appellant
seek
to
do
the
railway
express
case,
simply
by
saying
that
traffic
regulation
was
therein
involved.
in
fact,
this
whole
concept
of
permissible
local
regulation
of
local
incidents
in
interstate
commerce,
commerce,
arose
with
the
traffic
case,
cooley
versus
board
of
port
wardens.
there
it
was
--
the
states
were
allowed
to
make
certain
requirements
of
harbor
patents.
so
the
whole
concept
of
local
regulation
of
a
certain
incidence
of
interstate
commerce
arose
in
a
traffic
case,
we
might
say.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
they
--
they
aren't
justice
black.
it
is
--
it
is
for
the
individual
practicing
optometrist
to
say
what
he
shall
charge
for
both
his
lens
and
his
frames.
and
also,
it
is
for
the
individual
optometrist
to
say
how
much
he
shall
charge
for
such
services
as
eye
examinations.
those
are
not
fixed
by
any
regulatory
board.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
the
purpose
of
this
is
exactly
--
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
yes,
sir.
the,
the
purpose
is
the
same
as
in
williams
--
to
prevent
all
who
deal
with
so
precious
a
thing
as
human
eyesight
from
resorting
to
any
of
the
methods
of
commercialism.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
yes,
sir.
but
here
we
don't.
new
mexico
does
not
fix
minimum
prices
for
optometric
services,
lenses
or
frames
or
anything
like
that.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
the
sale
of
whiskey
sir?
well,
as
to
the
liquor
cases,
there
was
the
wilson
act,
enacted
by
congress
as
to
whiskey
act.
there
was
the
wilson
act.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
i
think
not,
your
honor,
i
--
of
course
there
was
a
legitimate
concern
by
congress
that
the
states
might
not
be
able
to
act.
but
we
contend
that
the
states
could
have
acted
to
have
prevented
the
advertisement
of
intoxicating
liquors
against
their
law
if
those
ads
have
originated
within
the
particular
state,
even
absent
the
wilson
act.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
i
see.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
i
don't
know,
justice
black.
i
don't
know
what
--
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
no,
justice
black.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
no,
your
honor.
that
is
not
the
aim,
either
the
direct
aim
or
the
indirect
aim.
it
is
not
to
fix
prices;
it
is
to
prevent
those
people
around
--
who
deal
with
the
human
eye
from
resorting
to
the
methods
of
the
marketplace
in
placing
their
advertisement.
it
is
designed
to
prevent
the
cutthroat
competition
from
entering
the
field
of
human
eye
treatment.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
no,
no,
i
think
not
your
honor
because
--
well
in
here,
what
new
mexico
is
doing
here
is
to
prevent
the
advertising
of
frames
by
optometrist
or
lenses
or
what
have
you,
for
any
reason
--
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
at
discount
prices
for
--
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
well,
in
that
sense,
yes,
your
honor.
we
must
concede
that
there
is
some
inhibition
upon
their
advertising,
that
they
want
to
sell
at
this
or
that
price.
now,
they
may
go
ahead
and
sell
at
any
price
they
want
to.
the
law
does
not
say
that
they
must
receive
so
much
for
the
lands
or
so
much
for
the
performances.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
they
just
can't
tell
anyone
that
i
am
selling
glasses
cheaper
than
x
or
i
am
selling
glasses
at
so
much
higher.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
they
can
have
a
competitive
system,
that
is
right,
justice
black,
but
they
can't
resort
to
price
advertisement
of
that
competitive
sort.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
yes,
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
but
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
interstate
traffic
in
glasses.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
yes,
justice
black.
we
are
dealing
with
advertising
which
we
much
admit
is
over
--
is
through
interstate
commerce
because
of
these
radio
signals
crossing
the
state
line.
but
we
are
not
dealing
in
interstate
commerce
of
glasses
or
frames.
that
is
not
involved
at
all.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
i
have
a
vague
idea
of
what
is
of
his
honor
is
driving
at,
and
the
vagueness
is
my
fault
of
course.
but
i
don't
think
that
is
in
the
picture
here.
i
don't
think
that
is
relevant.
i
think
here
what
we
have
is
a
williamson
situation,
albeit
that
there
are
minor
differences
between
the
facts.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
yes,
justice
black.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
i
was
going
on
to
say
plus
the
fact
that
the
advertising
against
state
law
is
promulgated
in
interstate
commerce.
and
we
don't
have
a
federal
statute
on
the
subject
that
we
have
been
able
to
discover
nor
is
there
a
regulation
by
the
communications
commission,
which
we
have
been
able
to
discover.
now,
in
the
fair
trade
and
anti-trust
fields,
i
know
there
have
been
volumes
of
federal
legislations
on
those
subjects
which
permit
the
states
to
act
where
perhaps
in
some
instances,
they
could
not
have
otherwise
acted.
here
we
are
neither
in
fair
trade
or
anti-trust.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
in
interstate
commerce?
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
i
think
not,
justice
black.
if
i
understood
your
question
correctly,
it
was
--
a
hypothetical
one
if
new
mexico
prohibited
certain
people
from
selling
to
others
in
interstate
commerce,
there
you
would
have
--
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
no,
sir.
that
if
we
can
--
if
new
mexico's
enactment
were
contrary
to
the
clayton
act,
it
would
fall
under
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
clause.
to
take
his
honor's
earlier
example,
if
new
mexico
sought
to
fix
the
terms
of
certain
sales
from
one
party
to
another
in
interstate
commerce,
it
then
would
have
enacted
a
law
directed
at
interstate
commerce
and
which
on
it's
face
purported
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
no
sir.
here,
new
mexico's
law
is
not
discriminatory
and
indeed
the
appellant's
have
not
suggested
that
it
is.
and
the
affect
on
interstate
commerce
here
is
incidental
to
the
enforcement
of
the
legitimate
police
power
measure.
interestingly
enough,
justice
black
in
the
williamson
case
which
we
were
discussing,
this
court
said
that
it
saw
no
constitutional
reason
why
all
who
deal
with
the
human
eye
shouldn't
be
prevented
from
resorting
to
commercial
methods.
that's
all
new
mexico
--
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
i
think
--
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
yes,
sir.
but
i
refer
the
williamson
in
this
connection.
point
has
been
made
by
opposing
counsel
that
here
new
mexico's
action
isn't
operating
against
the
optometrist,
rather
it
is
operating
against
the
advertising
media
with
which
the
optometrist
has
chosen
to
place
his
advertisement.
but
we
think
that
it
must
follow
from
the
williamson
case.
that
like
legislation
directed
against
the
advertising
media
is
equally
valid
as
was
the
oklahoma
legislation
involved
in
williamson.
that
fact
that
new
mexico
has
chosen
to
be
a
little
broader
and
prevent,
not
just
the
optometrist,
but
any
person
from
promulgating
this
advertising
is
we
submit
simply
a
rational
means
chosen
to
achieve
the
same
proper
ends
as
were
involved
in
williamson.
now,
insofar
as
their
--
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
justice
--
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
justice
goldberg
--
mr.
robert
f.
pyatt
it
did
start
out,
justice
goldberg,
pretty
broad.
but
later
on
there
was
a
proviso
in
the
oklahoma
statute
to
the
effect
that
this
shall
not
affect
any
newspaper
or
other
--
i
believe
the
words
were
advertising
media.
but
the
other
advertising
media
would
have
taken
care
of
the
radios
to
so.
they
were
exempted
by
means
of
proviso.
now,
insofar
as
freedom
of
speech
is
concerned,
under
the
semler
decision,
semler
versus
oregon
state
board,
there
is
no
deprivation
of
either
freedom
of
speech
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
fourteenth
amendment,
nor
is
there
a
deprivation
of
due
process
law,
property,
without
due
process
of
law,
nor
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
the
semler
decision
said
that
there
was
no
deprivation
of
either
liberty,
which
could
only
have
meant
freedom
of
speech
in
that
instance
or
property.
so
any
attempted
distinction
by
the
appellants
or
argument
by
the
appellants,
that
freedom
of
speech
is
being
fringed
upon
in
this
case
has
been
settled
by
the
semler
decision
which
incidentally
held
that
it
was
irrelevant
that
the
--
in
that
case
the
dentist
advertising
was
truthful.
insofar
as
privileges
and
immunities
may
be
concerned,
we
simply
call
the
court's
attention
to
madden
versus
commonwealth,
where
the
right
to
carry
on
business
beyond
the
state
of
the
party's
residence
was
held
not
to
be
a
privilege
and
immunity
of
national
citizenship.
to
summarize,
there
is
no
state,
there
is
no
federal
act
or
regulation
in
conflict
with
new
mexico's
act.
it
is
simply
a
health
measure
under
williamson.
it
does
go
a
step
further
and
reach
advertising
in
this
case
which
is
promulgated
in
interstate
commerce,
but
we
think
new
mexico
--
the
effect
of
new
mexico's
action
on
that
interstate
commerce
is
simply
a
permissible
activity,
local
in
concern
into
the
railway
express,
the
huron,
the
kelly
cases.
and
we
submit
that
there
is
no
constitutional
invalidity
in
new
mexico's
action.
