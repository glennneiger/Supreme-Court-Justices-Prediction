what
is
meant
here
by
the
act
that
said,
advertising
by
any
means,
quotation
and
prices,
and
so
forth,
which
quotes
discount
to
be
offered
on
eyeglasses,
discount
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
this
--
this
seems
something,
let's
say,
advertising
if
you
sell
at
a
discount.does
that
make
it
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
have
better
health
if
they
denied
the
privilege
of
buying
at
a
discount?
justice
hugo
l.
black
moderate
prices,
that's
also
a
crime,
if
the
advertiser
does
moderate
prices.
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
this
policy,
the
prices
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
prices
had
no
harm
on
him?
it
seems
to
be
they're
always
(inaudible)
by
prices,
and
there's
no
way
it
threatens?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
doesn't
say
anything
about
that,
does
it?
unconscionable
price
is
too
high.
your
argument
maybe
judged
without
just
--
testing
it
out.
suppose
you
had
this
same
thing
with
reference
to
a
and
b
stores
and
all
the
groceries
stores,
with
foods
there
important
to
people,
if
they
paid
more
for
it,
it
might
be
better.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
position
that
new
mexico
can
enforce
this
rule
as
to
any
valid
law
which
can
be
applied
to
the
people
of
the
state?
do
you
--
is
that
--
suppose,
there
are
many
things
that
new
mexico
might
not
like
on
its
radio
programs
that
other
sections
would,
you
would
see
no
restriction
to
that
throughout
the
country.
suppose
it
passed
a
law
that
by
a
reason
of
certain
things,
the
people
in
new
mexico
couldn't
show
certain
kind
of
pictures,
which
were
not
ranked
as
indecent,
obscene,
whatever
it
means,
could
you
enforce
that
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
commission?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
call
--
you
would
call
that
censorship
and
would
not
call
this
censorship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
based
on
the
idea
that
is
commercial
advertising
over
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
name
of
that
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
cited
in
your
brief
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
was
newspaper
published
in
another
state,
brought
into
new
mexico,
would
you
bar
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
under
the
--
because
you'd
say
that
you
have
a
right
to
prevent
that,
now,
the
whiskey
cases
are
written
in
the
dry
states,
but
the
law
was
sustained,
rested
on
the
passing
of
an
act
of
congress
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
of
them
sustained
but
did
not
rest
on
an
act
of
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
prison-made
goods,
i
believe
that
was
under
an
act
of
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that
has
been
stricken
down
before
that
act
of
congress
was
passed?
i
do
not
recall.
i
was
asking
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
recall.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
it,
there
was
quite
a
controversy
over
that
for
a
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
congress
did
pass
an
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
were
many
states
that
prohibited
the
sale
of
prison-made
goods
and
the
act
that's
passed
by
congress,
i
suppose,
led
to
make
those
legal
despite
the
commerce
clause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
rely
for
that
on
an
act
of
congress,
permitting
a
fair
trade
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
constitutionally
without
regard
to
where
the
congress
has
passed
such
law,
you
believe
you
could.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
the
law
been
the
same
in
this
respect
since
the
sanders
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
are
your
prices
fixed
for
glasses
in
new
mexico?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
purpose
of
this,
as
i
understood
you,
is
to
aid
help
by
keeping
the
prices
up
higher.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
is
--
which
was
upheld
intrastate
in
williams.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
miller-tydings
act
grants
a
state's
authority
to
do
what's
you
called
burden
in
commerce
by
price
fixing
if
the
state
wants
to
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
necessity
for
having
the
miller-tydings
act
if
your
argument
is
right
here
because
the
schwegmann
case
was
decided
under
the
miller-tydings
act,
which
was
the
sale
of
whiskey
within
dry
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
had
to
be,
didn't
it?
because
despite
the
fact
that
whiskey
is
considered
at
many
places
being
injurious
to
health,
many
states
has
prohibited
entirely,
that
law
had
to
be
--
that
act
had
to
be
passed,
isn't
it?
to
permit
states
to
do
anything
at
all
with
reference
to
regulating
the
sale
of
whiskey
in
them
through
interstate
commerce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
the
main
--
i
wouldn't
call
it
lobbying,
but
the
main
association,
the
main
activities
of
the
passage
of
the
miller-tydings
act
came
from
the
drug
use
case
to
deal
in
med
--
medicine
for
the
human
beings.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
the
law
that
permitted
states
to
fix
prices,
but
this
court
first,
struck
it
down
on
the
ground
--
on
--
partly
and
the
congress
had
amended
it,
so
as
to
extend
it
giving
further
power
to
the
states
to
fix
prices.
now,
yours
is
not
fixing
prices
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
is
indirectly
aimed
at
it,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
law
which
if
it
had
been
--
that
same
regulation
had
been
adopted
by
agreement
of
(inaudible)
would
have
violated
the
sherman
anti-trust
act,
didn't
it?
the
clayton
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
discount
prices?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
extends
if
it
bars
them
from
trying
to
sell
at
the
price
they
want
to
sell?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
certainly
can't
tell
anybody
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
can
have
a
competitive
system,
but
they
can't
advertise?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
you
this
question
because
there
doesn't
seem
to
have
been
much
discussion
on
the
fact
that
the
court
has
held
in
many
cases
that
with
reference
to
the
price
fixing
and
handling
of
things
of
this
kind,
the
states
can't
interfere
with
what
interstate
commerce
permits
to
flow
through
except
when
congress
passes
an
act
permitting
it.
there
have
been
many
cases
of
that
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we're
dealing
with
the
advertising
of
the
interstate
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
the
setting
of
the
--
of
your
law
in
connection
with
the
question
of
preemption
or
burden
of
commerce,
in
a
light
was
sown
on
it
by
the
many
times
that
congress
has
permitted
states
to
enforce
laws
which
were
valid
within
them,
to
apply
them
to
interstate
commerce
transactions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you'll
have
a
williamson
situation,
if
all
you
were
doing
was
enforcing
it
inside
the
state
with
reference
to
people
who
advertise
to
sell
inside?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
state
of
new
mexico
had
the
sudden
specific
thing
that
cannot
be
done
in
other
interstate
commerce
transaction,
like
selling
to
one
person
cheaper
than
another,
things
of
that
kind
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
mexico
decided
it
--
new
mexico
decided
to
adopt
the
policy
of
letting
people
fix
--
sell
at
different
prices?
even
though
that
matter
came
from
outside
the
state,
could
they
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
fix
the
terms
on
which
the
sales
could
be
made,
but
which
contrary
to
those
fixed
in
the
clayton
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
far
i'm
concerned
that
case
settles
your
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
insofar
as
transactions
wholly
within
the
boundaries
of
new
mexico
are
concerned
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
insofar
as
it
does
not
--
your
law
does
not
attempt
in
any
way
to
regulate
radio
transmission,
contrary
to
the
either
expressed
or
implied
coverage
of
the
radio,
of
this
radio
ad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
are
those
advertising?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
are
those
price
advertising?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
you
get
any
advantage
out
of
them,
if
they
are
not
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
do
not
have
them,
how
do
we
know
they
are
price
advertisements?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
this
--
i
want
to
ask
you
one
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
looked
at
your
stipulation.
i
see
no
--
is
there
any
definition
of
price
ads
anywhere?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
this
mean
that
this
man
in
texas
advertises
to
this
radio
in
new
mexico
that
he
would
sell
glasses
at
certain
prices
in
texas?
