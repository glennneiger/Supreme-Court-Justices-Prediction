mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
order
granting
certiorari
in
this
case
divided
the
views
of
the
federal
government
upon
whether
the
state
statute
as
applied
by
the
courts
below,
unconstitutionally
invaded
an
area
preempted
by
the
federal
communications
act.
the
facts
pertinent
to
that
question
are
very
simple
indeed.
an
optometrist
in
texas
sought
to
send
materials
and
send
it
by
telephone,
i
believe,
to
a
radio
station
whose
transmitter
was
in
new
mexico
to
be
broadcast
over
an
area
which
included
residents
of
both
states,
slightly
more
of
the
area
being
in
texas
apparently
than
in
new
mexico
where
the
transmitter
was
located.
the
material
in
turn
invited
sales
not
in
new
mexico
but
in
texas
where
the
optometrist
was
located.
and
from
the
standpoint
of
preemption,
i
think,
it
makes
no
difference
whatever
of
why
the
optometrist
located
where
he
did;
the
fact
is
that
he
was
in
texas.
and
i
don't
believe
the
question
of
preemption
as
affected
by
his
state
of
mind
or
that
would
be
a
different
rule
according
to
why
a
person
was
in
the
other
state.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no.
it's
simply
--
i
think
it
makes
no
difference
why
he
is
in
texas.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
well,
i
would
develop
it
and
say
it
more
later
but
very
briefly
justice
white,
i
think
that
is
simply
one
of
the
aspects
which
may
be
relevant
in
the
overall
judgment.
i
suspect
we
would
come
out
the
same
way
but
i
would
have
to
admit
that
i
put
some
reliance
on
that
and
that
a
distinction
is
impossible.
the
rest
of
my
argument
would
be
very
much
the
same
which
you'll
see.
we
conclude
as
i
intimated
my
previous
sentence
that
the
field
has
been
preempted
that
the
state
law
as
applied
to
the
radio
station
here
is
invalid.
i
expect
to
divide
my
argument
into
three
parts.
first,
we
show
that
the
federal
communications
commission
is
given
wide
power
over
all
aspects
of
radio
and
of
course
television
programming
including
advertising
in
the
course
of
granting,
renewing,
and
revoking
licenses.
second,
we
submit
that
when
congress
set
up
a
regulatory
commission
with
authority
to
take
programming
and
advertising
into
account
in
administering
this
comprehensive
system
of
licensing,
then
it
barred
the
states
from
direct
and
substantial
regulation
of
the
content
of
interstate
broadcast.
and
then
i
come
to
the
third
and
essential
point
which
is
that
in
our
judgment
the
new
mexico
statute
in
this
case
prohibiting
advertising
in
the
price
of
eyeglasses
is
what
i
call
a
direct
and
substantial
regulation
of
the
content
of
radio
programs.
my
first
point
really
requires
almost
no
argument.
the
broad
scope
of
the
federal
communications
act
as
indicated
by
the
declaration
of
policy
processes
the
special
provisions
relating
to
radio.
the
purpose
of
that
chapter,
as
declared
to
be,
to
maintain
the
control
of
the
united
states
over
all
the
channels
of
interstate
and
foreign
radio
transmission
and
to
provide
for
the
use
of
such
channels
under
licenses
granted
by
federal
authority.
the
regulatory
authority
of
course
is
vested
in
the
communications
commission.
that
commission
is
set
up
by
--
it's
first
setup
by
section
1
of
the
entire
act.
and
there,
the
purpose
according
to
that
section
was
to
the
purpose
of
creating
the
commission,
was
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
from
communication
by
wire
and
radio
so
far
as
to
make
them
available
so
far
as
possible
to
all
the
people
of
the
united
states,
and
for
the
purpose
of
securing
a
more
effective
execution
of
this
policy
that
is
making
them
available
to
all
the
people
of
the
united
states
by
centralizing
authority
heretofore
granted
by
law
to
several
agencies.
now,
i
think
the
several
agencies
that
it
refers
to
were
all
federal
agencies.
i
don't
want
to
overstate
the
point.
but
the
use
of
the
words
by
centralizing
authority,
i
do
think
indicates
a
disposition
to
have
all
the
control
of
the
radio
stations
in
one
place.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
federal
trade
commission
would
have
the
same
authority
over
this
false
advertising
as
over
any
other
false
advertising.
and
indeed,
i
shall
show
later
when
i
come
to
the
critical
words
directly
substantial
that
i'm
not
suggesting
that
no
state
law
of
any
character
can
ever
be
applied
to
a
radio
station.
really,
you
see
that
would
come
on
the
third
part
of
my
argument.
i
want
first
to
show
that
some
state
laws
are
excluded.
but
i
call
those
having
direct
and
substantial
impact.
mr.
archibald
cox
false
advertising
would
be
scrutinized
by
federal
agencies
in
two
ways.
first,
the
federal
communications
commission
would
take
this
into
his
account.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
takes
it
into
account
in
fact
to
this
extent.
let
me
--
let
me
develop
just
one
or
two
points
and
i
think
the
answer
will
become
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
we
must
misunderstand
each
other.
what
there
is,
is
the
federal
communications
commission
in
the
licensing
process
as
i
was
about
to
say,
has
authority
indeed
must
take
into
account
content
programs.
there
is
no
explicit
prohibition
so
far
as
i
can
now
recall
in
the
communications
act
of
false
advertising.
i
would
base
on
the
licensing
authority
and
its
actual
exercise
to
scrutinize
the
character
of
advertisements
that
stations
broadcast
when
it
comes
to
renewing
their
license
or
possibly
revoking
them.
on
that
basis,
i
would
argue
preemption,
yes.
and
the
fact
that
the
federal
trade
commission
has
some
--
before
of
some
authority
over
false
advertising,
forms
no
part
of
my
argument.
mr.
archibald
cox
forms
no
part
of
it
at
all.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
a
function
of
its
licensing.
it's
comprehended
within
its
licensing.
mr.
archibald
cox
which
includes
revocation
and
renewal
and
of
course
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
believe
not.
you
see,
section
326
of
the
federal
communications
act
which
must
be
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
affirmative
licensing
provision
that
provides
that
nothing
in
the
act
shall
be
understood
or
construed
to
give
the
commission
the
power
of
censorship
over
radio
communication
and
then
goes
on
and
says,
the
commission
shan't
anyway
interfere
with
the
right
of
freedom
of
commu
--
mass
communication.
so
if
the
commission's
authority
is
between
the
two,
you
can
find
it
in
the
licensing
provision
but
as
limited
by
this
explicit
substantive
provision.
within
that
limit,
the
commission
and
as
part
of
its
licensing
function
must
scrutinize
the
content
of
programs
and
advertising
companies
because
there
are
more
applicants
and
potential
applicants
for
frequencies
of
the
television
channels
that
are
available.
mr.
archibald
cox
a
single
misstep
--
mr.
archibald
cox
not
necessarily.
no.
there's
nothing
--
there's
never
been
anything
comparable
to
cease
and
desist
orders
and
i'm
not
aware
of
anything
that
would
enable
you
to
issue.
mr.
archibald
cox
to
that
extent,
yes.
as
to
the
power
(voice
overlap)
mr.
archibald
cox
i
didn't
think
that
what
anything
that
i
have
said
is
in
any
way
challenged
in
litigation.
i'm
going
to
check
it
overnight
but
i'm
not
aware
of
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
during
the
opening
of
my
argument
yesterday,
i
was
showing
that
the
federal
communications
commission
has
a
comprehensive
jurisdiction
over
radio
broadcast
and
particularly
over
the
programs
and
programming.
the
view
of
the
commission
with
respect
to
its
powers
which
come
under
the
licensing
authority
as
i
was
seeking
to
develop
is
perhaps
best
set
forth
in
a
passage
quoted
from
one
of
its
statements
of
policy
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
19
of
our
brief.
broadcasting
licensee
as
the
commission
said,
must
assume
responsibility
for
all
material
which
is
broadcast
through
their
facility.
this
includes
all
programs
and
advertising
material
which
they
present
to
the
public.
with
respect
to
advertising
the
material,
the
licensee
has
the
additional
responsibility
to
take
all
reasonable
measures
to
avoid
any
false,
misleading
or
deceptive
matter,
and
to
avoid
abuses
with
respect
to
the
total
amount
of
time
devoted
to
advertising
continuity
as
well
as
the
frequency
with
which
regular
programs
are
interrupted
for
advertising
message.
now,
that
is
not
simply
and
idle
declaration.
the
commission
has
consistently
in
determining
whether
to
renew
a
license
or
to
revoke
a
license
taken
into
account
the
character
of
the
programs
and
particularly
the
character
of
the
advertising
by
a
station.
for
example
in
one
case,
the
commission
sustained
in
the
examiner's
finding
that
a
radio
station
had
been
guilty
of
a
breach
of
its
duty
as
a
licensee
because
it
engaged
in
what
was
known
as
bait
and
switch
advertising.
and
in
another
case,
one
of
the
grounds
for
failing
to
renew
a
license
was
that
the
radio
station
had
run
a
so-called
“medical
question
box”,
answering
questions
about
health
and
then
advertising
or
offering
prescriptions
from
the
sale
of
which
it
received
commission
the
same
way
the
commission
has
on
a
number
of
occasions
expressed
its
concern
about
advertising
of
beer
and
other
malt
beverages
in
states
where
their
sale
was
prohibited.
and
only
recently
the
commission
scheduled
a
proceeding
to
determine
whether
it
should
promulgate
some
kind
of
a
rule
or
standard
on
the
amounts
of
time
of
which
may
be
developed
to
--
may
be
devoted
to
advertising.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
take
that
into
--
it
would
take
that
into
account.
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
the
state
law
would
be
determined.
this
is
something
it
would
take
into
account
very
clearly.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
closest
--
the
closest
illustration
that
comes
to
my
mind
is
the
“medical
question
box”
illustration,
in
which
i'm
not
able
to
say
it
was
the
only
ground
because
i
don't
remember
but
at
least
one
of
the
grounds
on
which
a
license
was
not
renewed
was
that
the
station
had
engaged
in
this
practice.
now,
the
case
that
is
close
to
it
and
which
i
think
is
the
case
that
justice
white
must
have
referred
to
yesterday
when
he
said,
“this
power
was
challenged”,
involves
a
little
different
question
but
i
think
it
does
--
it
is
certainly
close
to
the
point.
there
is
a
station,
i
believe,
the
palmetto
broadcasting
company
or
something
like
that
in
south
carolina,
whose
license
was
not
renewed
for
two
reasons:
that
they
were
allegedly
false
representations
made
to
the
commission;
and
second
because
a
good
part
of
the
commentary
by
one
of
its
disc
jockeys
was
believed
by
the
commission
to
be
in
very
bad
taste
if
not
obscene.
as
i
am
informed,
justice
white,
there
is
no
challenge
to
the
power
of
the
commission
to
take
these
things
into
account.
there
is
in
that
case,
a
challenge
that
centering
--
that
taking
it
into
account
as
bad
taste
because
it's
arguably
obscene
of
passes
over
the
line
in
the
censorship
and
i
would
have
to
acknowledge
here,
do
acknowledge,
that
the
commission's
power
to
deal
with
this
subject
matter
is
of
course
limited
by
the
provision
in
the
statute
that
i
mentioned
yesterday
that
says,
it
should
not
engage
in
censorship.
but
within
the
two
banks
of
that
canal,
it
has
unquestionably
exercised
its
powers.
now,
i
should
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it
is
never
--
of
course,
the
government
in
order
to
deal
with
this
problem,
would
rely
on
the
federal
trade
commission
as
another
weapon
if
it
was
false
advertising.
this
case,
i
submit,
is
not
false
advertising.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
spoke
too
--
i
spoke
too
broadly.
i
was
thinking
of
the
advertising
company
or
the
sponsor
of
the
program
when
i
--
when
i
answered
justice
goldberg.
of
course,
the
section
you
call
attention
to
required
qualification
of
what
i
said.
there
is
one
other
point
about
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
communications
commission
--
and
indeed,
one
might
--
one
might
draw
an
inference
from
the
section
you
mentioned,
also,
i
confess
i
haven't
really
thought
it
through
that
the
just
as
the
federal
trade
commission
was
excluded
in
a
sense
for
dealing
with
licensee,
so
there
is
all
the
more
reason
to
think
that
the
states
would
be
excluded
from
doing
the
same
thing.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
necessarily.
not
necessarily,
but
i
think
it
may
point
in
that
direction.
there's
one
other
point
to
avoid
misconstruction
that
i
should
mention.
we
do
stand
on
the
licensing
power
here.
yesterday,
i
was
asked,
i
think
it
was
justice
brennan,
“was
there
any
power
to
issue
a
cease-and-desist
order
and
i
answered
we
didn't
rely
on
that
or
no.
my
answer
was,
again,
perhaps
a
little
too
broad.
the
federal
communications
commission
does
have
a
broad
rulemaking
authority
for
the
purposes
of
carrying
out
provisions
of
the
act.
if
the
commission
issued
a
rule
dealing
with
the
character
of
advertising
or
the
amount
of
time
given
to
advertising,
then
it
could
issue
cease-and-desist
orders
directed
against
the
violation
of
that
rule.
and
then,
the
cease-and-desist
orders
that
can
be
enforced
in
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
though,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
--
i
say
this
simply
to
avoid
any
misunderstanding
about
the
scope
of
the
commission's
power.
i'm
not
relying
on
this
argument
here
because
the
commission
has
not
made
any
such
regulation
or
there
may
be
questions
about
how
broad
the
power
is.
i
was
just
afraid
i
might
have
conceded
so
–-
mr.
archibald
cox
--
i
did
not
mean
to
concede.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
assume
that
it
would
be
relevant.
but
in
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
assume
without
having
any
knowledge.
i
would
assume
now
that
this
would
not
be
a
reason
to
deny
a
renewal
--
mr.
archibald
cox
quite
true
but
frequently
preemption
results
to
a
violation
of
what
would
be
the
state
law
if
the
state
law
were
valid.
now
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
say,
i
think
the
commission
would
not
regard
to
this
was
a
reason
for
denying
renewal
of
a
license,
although,
i'm
just
guessing
is
this,
new
mexico
--
texas
has
a
quite
different
view
as
to
where
the
propriety
of
this
advertising.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
the
commission
might.
the
commission
--
and
i
think
the
commission
must
take
into
account
after
all
in
terms
of
where
the
optometrist
was
located
or
optician
in
terms
of
where
the
sales
took
place,
this
was
all
entirely
lawful
and
about
40%
of
the
states
do
not
in
any
sense
forbids
this
kind
of
advertising.
so
that
the
--
here
the
commission
might
well
come
down
the
other
way.
now,
this
was
conduct
that
violated
the
laws
of
every
state
and
therefore
was
more
serious.
i
can
think
that
even
though
it
is
a
few
instances
unless
there
were
assurances
that
they
would
be
stopped,
that
the
commission
might
well
reach
a
different
result.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
court
--
the
court
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
court
has
held
--
the
court
has
held
that
new
mexico
has
the
power
to
make
that
finding
in
the
williamson
case.
and
i
would
point
out
here
though
that
so
far
as
new
mexico's
power
to
deal
with
new
mexican
optometrists
and
opticians,
there
is
no
question
about
its
power
to
deal
with
them.
furthermore,
i
would
think
that
as
i
suggested
yesterday
that
a
distinction
at
least
might
be
drawn
depending
on
whether
this
was
a
new
mexican
optician
or
optometrist.
certainly,
he
could
be
dealt
with.
alright
now,
there
may
well
be
a
difference,
i
don't
think
it's
the
whole
argument
because
the
arguments
that
i
hope
that
time
to
make
that
would
bear
on
both
cases.
but
i
think
there
may
well
be
a
difference
between
the
case
where
new
mexico
prosecutes
the
radio
station
as
in
aider
or
abettor
in
what
is
clearly
in
offense
within
new
mexico's
jurisdiction,
and
the
case
where
what
new
mexico
is
seeking
to
do
is
to
take
hold
of
this
transmitter
which
happens
to
be
located
within
its
border.
as
a
way
of
cutting
off
a
transaction
coming
in
from
texas,
cutting
off
radio
broadcast
going
to
both
territories,
going
back
to
texas
in
part,
and
bearing
upon
sales
that
are
going
to
take
in
place
in
texas.
there
it
is,
if
i
might
just
finish
the
thought,
there
i
think
it
is
true
to
say
that
new
mexico
is
in
the
sense
singling
out
the
transmitter
and
trying
to
use
it
as
a
way
of
accomplishing
something
it
couldn't
otherwise
come
to.
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
focused
upon
a
licensee
under
the
communications
act,
in
a
way
that
makes
this
not
quite,
but
something
of
a
direct
effort
to
regulate
interstate
broadcasting
as
such
almost.
i
do
have
to
add
the
“almost”
but
it
is
very
much
so
to
my
way
of
thinking.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
in
our
–
we
have
briefed
only
the
preemption
part.
i
think
to
answer
you,
i
really
have
to
express
a
little
bit
review
on
the
other.
i
find
this
an
exceedingly
close
case
on
the
commerce
part.
i
think
it
might
well
be
held
that
on
commerce
grounds,
this
was
unlawful.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
determining
whether
there
is
preemption,
it
is
quite
proper
to
take
into
account
the
considerations
that
are
also
relevant
on
the
commerce
part.
and
after
all,
what
we're
trying
to
do
here
in
determining
whether
there
is
preemption
is,
i
take
it,
to
determine
the
intent
of
congress.
if
congress
--
the
appellees
in
amicus
argue,
that
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
squared
conflict.
that
is
not
the
test
as
this
court
has
laid
it
down.
there
are
many
cases
where
the
court
has
said
that
supplementary
legislation
by
a
state
is
improper,
that
legislation
in
an
area
that
congress
intended
to
be
free
as
improper,
the
duplicate
legislation
is
improper.
the
question
is,
did
congress
when
it
passed
this
statute
intend
the
whole
area
to
be
subjected
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
communications
commission
or
did
it
intend
to
leave
the
way
open
for
each
of
50
states
to
pass
such
additional
laws
in
the
area
as
each
or
all
of
the
50
might
see
fit.
now
on
the
question
intent,
justice
goldberg,
i
think
that
these
considerations
that
i
have
mentioned
--
been
mentioning
some
of
them,
are
highly
important.
for
example,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance,
that
this
is
a
subject
in
which
the
dominant
interest
are
multistate
because
it
is
the
more
likely
that
congress
would
not
choose
to
delegate
them
to
individual
state.
again,
it
seems
to
me,
it's
of
the
utmost
importance
that
this
is
something
that
so
far
as
congress
limited
the
powers
of
the
commission,
it
did
so
i
submit,
not
out
of
the
desire
to
leave
this
to
local
control,
but
out
of
a
recognition
that
we
were
in
the
area
or
close
to
the
area
of
freedom
of
speech.
and
i
think
the
limit
on
the
commission's
power,
the
fact
that
it
should
not
get
into
censorship
reflects
as
substantive
policy
that
when
one
to
expect
to
be
just
as
applicable
to
the
state,
as
to
the
commission
itself.
so
that
here,
the
failure
to
regulate
programming
more
is
to
be
explained
not
by
leaving
something
for
state
law
to
operate
in,
but
as
an
adoption
of
a
substantive
policy
of
not
allowing
any
regulation
in
that
area,
and
therefore
as
an
indication
of
the
desire
to
exclude
this
day.
again,
i
think
it
is
relevant
in
determining
preemptions
whether
this
is
a
subject
in
which
the
state
really
has
any
vital
interest
or
can
really
do
very
much
about
it.
i
pointed
out
here
that
there
is
a
way
for
the
state
to
deal
with
its
vital
interest
so
far
the
optometrists
or
opticians
are
concerned,
it's
also
true
of
course
that
it
can't
deal
very
much
about
this.
and
whenever
it
does
try
to
do
anything
about
it,
it
affects
the
people
of
other
states.
new
mexico
can't
control
the
broadcasting
from
the
station
in
seminole
or
around
the
texas
side
of
the
line.
it
can't
keep
the
airwaves
from
reaching
its
citizens.
all
it
can
do
is
put
this
station,
adding
on
together
the
capriciously
disadvantaged.
again,
if
new
york
attempts
to
deal
--
attempts
to
control
of
what
is
broadcast
from
a
radio
station
in
new
york,
it
is
attempting
to
regulate
not
only
from
what
the
people
of
connecticut
can
hear,
what
people
of
new
jersey
can
hear,
and
of
course,
as
applied
to
something
like
chain
broadcasting
of
regulation
from
the
different
state,
would
create
an
altogether
impossible
situation.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
first,
i
would
say
that
although
31
have,
it's
equally
true
that
--
i
have
not
--
equally,
i
would
distinguish,
justice
goldberg,
it
very
sharply
between
the
problem
of
fraud
as
the
problem
of
the
advertising
on
price,
and
this
brings
me
to
a
question
which
is
very
important
here
and
i
would
hope
i
might
take
an
extra
minute
mr.
chief
justice
to
discuss
it.
now,
clearly
this
is
a
matter
of
drawing
a
line.
it's
quite
plain
that
a
state
may
apply
some
state
laws,
not
only
to
broadcasting
stations,
which
is
obvious,
but
to
broadcast.
for
example,
we
would
fully
agree
that
new
mexico
or
any
other
state
may
apply
its
laws
of
defamation
to
a
radio
station.
that
if
a
radio
station
knowingly
permits
its
facilities
be
used
to
broadcast
the
signals
to
a
gang
of
professional
thieves
or
gamblers
in
some
way,
that
the
ordinary
criminal
law
may
be
applied
to
the
broadcast.
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
to
us
entirely
clear
that
an
intolerable
situation
would
be
created
if
each
of
the
50
states
could
regulate
the
content
of
advertising,
the
time
that
the
station
might
give
to
advertising,
the
amount
of
it
which
might
be
--
have
to
be
in
local
origin
as
applied
to
national
origin,
where
is
the
line
to
be
drawn
in
between?
i
would
say
there
were
four
standards,
four
criteria
that
are
applicable.
the
first
would
seem
to
me
is
this
a
state
law
which
singles
out
radio
broadcasting
in
some
way
or
is
it
in
part
of
the
massive
general
laws
applicable
to
everybody
and
the
fact
that
it
is
done
over
the
radio
makes
no
difference
in
a
case
of
defamation
if
it's
done
in
conversation
that's
defamatory.
selling
--
obtaining
property
under
false
pretense.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
do
it
on
the
radio
or
otherwise.
this
case,
it
seems
to
us
to
come
according
to
these
criteria,
pretty
far
into
the
area
of
regulating
radio
broadcast
as
such.
first,
it
deals
only
with
mass
communications
which
does
not
exclude
the
newspapers
or
billboards,
but
nevertheless,
narrows
the
area,
to
an
area
close
bound
radio
broadcast.
and
in
second
place,
i
suggested
a
moment
ago,
this
is
an
effort
to
use
the
physical
location
of
the
transmitter,
the
broadcast
as
a
handle
for
doing
something
that
new
mexico
couldn't
otherwise
do.
the
second
line
of
inquiry
that
we
think
is
relevant
is
whether
the
state
law
falls
in
the
area
of
general
common
law
torts
or
crimes
whether
they've
been
incorporated
in
statute
or
into
the
more
modern
type
of
social
and
economic
legislation.
i
think
there
are
two
reasons
why
this
is
a
material
inquiry.
the
first
is
that
of
course,
any
statute
in
anglo-american
law
is
put
down
into
an
existing
body
of
law
and
it
takes
a
very
strong
showing
to
demonstrate
the
point
that
congress
intended
to
oust.
but
the
second
reason
is
that
whether
you're
dealing
with
crimes
that
are
malum
in
se
as
distinguished
from
malum
prohibitum
to
suggest,
rather
to
draw
a
sharp
distinction,
or
where
you're
dealing
with
the
common
law
torts,
you're
dealing
with
an
area
in
which
there
are
divergences.
but
on
the
whole,
the
law
of
the
50
states
is
the
same.
on
the
other
hand,
when
you
get
into
the
more
modern
type
of
social
and
economic
written
legislation,
the
opportunities
for
divergence
are
a
great
deal
(inaudible)
and
more
conflicts
in
uniformity,
and
more
conflicts
in
diversity
are
about
to
grow
out.
third,
we
think
it's
important
whether
the
measure
is
a
prior
restraint
or
attempts
to
deal
with
the
matter
after
the
event.
but
here,
quite
clearly,
we're
dealing
with
an
adjunction
in
the
area
of
prior
restraint.
and
fourth,
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
goldberg,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
degree
of
the
state's
interest
is
a
material
factor
in
determining
whether
you
have
preemption
because
you
have
to
consider
how
much
the
state
is
being
hurt.
and
i
would
with
reference
to
that
point
simply
refer
back
to
what
i
said
before
without
denying
that
new
mexico
has
interest.
it
is
an
interest
where
the
nature
of
the
technical
problems
limits
what
it
could
do
and
where
it
can
deal
with
the
problem
so
far
as
truly
domestic
to
new
mexico
without
the
necessity
of
taking
hold
the
radio
broadcast
or
broadcasters.

cox

there
are
those
hints
that
i
quoted
--
mr.

--
at
the
beginning

argument

mr.

--
that
speak
of
centralizing

and
enacting
legislation
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
people
of
the
united
states.
i
mentioned
only
in
that
connection
that
licenses
of
course
are
issued
without
regard
to
state
lines
because
of
the
necessity.
