is
that
to
say
that
hobbs
is
in
the
normal
trading
area
for
roberts'
store?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he'd
expect,
in
other
words,
the
biggest
part
of
his
fate
or
a
substantial
--
any
event
from
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
you
suggest
that
but
for
the
new
mexico
law
he'd
probably
located
his
business
in
hobbs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
gather
there
is
federal
regulation.
is
it
federal
trade
commission
of
false
advertising?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
sit
in
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
before
you
answer,
may
i
just
ask
this
question.
but
for
the
fact
that
there
is
some
federal
regulation
of
false
advertising,
would
you
be
making
the
preemption
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
forms
not
at
all.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
--
then
the
federal
regulation
limited
to
the
fcc
is
only
a
function
of
its
licensing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
has
no
power
then,
if
i
may
suggest,
in
a
way
of
a
cease
and
desist
order
dealing
with
a
specific
violation
of
advertising.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
have
to
make
it
a
single
misstep.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
would
force
the
license
or
renewal
necessarily
with
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
solicitor
general,
how
--
section
54
(b)
at
title
15
says,
“that
no
radio-broadcast
licensee,”
this
is
as
to
the
federal
trade
commission,
“shall
be
liable
under
this
section
by
reason
of
the
dissemination
by
him
of
any
false
advertisement,
unless
he
has
refused,
on
the
request
of
the
commission,
to
furnish
the
commission
the
name
and
post-office
address
of
the
manufacturer,”
and
so
forth.
how
--
does
federal
trade
commission
have
any
jurisdiction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
--
what
i
--
what
i
was
interested
yesterday
when
i
asked
you,
your
preemption
argument
then
doesn't
rest
at
all
upon
any
supposed
authority
in
the
federal
trade
commission.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
deal
with
deceptive
advertising.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
rests
exclusively
on
the
regulatory
authority
that
you've
been
discussing
of
the
federal
communications
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
follows
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
thing
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
had
in
mind
mr.
solicitor
general
was
this.
apparently
what
we
have
here,
at
least
as
applied
as
i
understand
it,
is
a
state
regulation
directed
only
at
price
advertising.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
all
this
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
might
be
merely
an
insolated
instance
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned,
an
isolated
instance.
and
i'm
just
wondering
whether
the
commission
on
the
basis
of
an
isolated
instance
under
its
present
rules
and
regulations
would
take
this
into
account
at
all
either
on
a
renewal
application
for
example.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
these
were
the
only
violations
that
were
involved
under
--
brought
to
the
commission's
attention
on
a
renewal
application,
would
it
be
a
sufficient
importance
that
the
commission
might
deny
renewal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
whatever
might
be
illegal
consequences,
if
that
were
true,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
new
mexico
law
that
if
you're
correct
about
preemption,
it
would
not
--
it
would
go
on
redressed
because
the
state
would
have
no
power
to
do
anything
about
it
and
the
federal
authority
would
do
nothing
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
yet
ordinarily,
i
take
it,
that
new
mexico
might,
as
a
health
measure,
think
that
price
advertising
might
induce
people
to
buy
eyeglasses
which
in
fact
would
do
no
good
for
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
