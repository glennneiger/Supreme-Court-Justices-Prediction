mr.
earl
e.
hartley
to
be
able
to
give
the
court
back
some
of
the
time
that
had
been
allocated.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
statute
enacted
by
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
involving
the
protection
of
a
health
of
its
citizens.
it
is
a
health
measure.
it
is
directed
at
all
of
the
peoples
of
the
state
of
new
mexico.
it
is
a
measure
that
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
for
anyone
within
the
state
of
new
mexico
to
advertise
glasses
or
other
types
of
fittings
for
the
eyes
with
what
we
would
ordinarily
term
bait
advertising.
we
can
think
of
nothing
that
it
is
more
precious
to
the
human
being
and
the
matter
of
health
than
good
eyesight.
we
can
think
of
nothing
that
could
be
appreciated
more
in
the
state
of
new
mexico
than
good
eyesight.
we
had
undoubtedly
the
widest
variety
of
beautiful
scenery
and
other
types
of
scenery.
we
also
--
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
our
sister
state
of
colorado
possesses
some
of
these
things
that
are
here,
your
honor,
but
texas
is
almost
devoid
and
â€“-
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
we
have
one
peak,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
now,
that
we
must
get
into
side
arguments,
but
in
this
connection,
we
have
also
become
the
center
of
the
universe
under
the
new
nuclear
age.
we
have
the
laboratories
in
which
--
made
your
portion
of
the
nuclear
development
is
taking
place,
the
testing
grounds,
and
we
also
are
producing
about
more
than
80%
of
the
nuclear
fission
of
all
materials,
making
it
more
than
ever
important,
that
we
protect
the
eyesight
of
the
citizens
of
our
state.
as
the
commercial
aspect
of
this
thing
is
incidental,
it's
de
minimis.
the
examination
by
professional
people
of
eyes
and
the
prescription
for
their
care,
and
if
necessary
the
fittings
of
lenses
is
one
that
is
necessarily
of
a
local
nature.
the
transaction
takes
place
outmost
inclusively
within
the
examiner's
office.
this
act
has
been
referred
to
as
the
optometrist's
act.
actually,
the
board
of
optometry
is
simply
the
one
that
has
been
designated
by
the
state
to
enforce
the
act.
it
would
prohibit
little
work
from
advertising
glasses
and
prices.
the
type
of
action
here
are
the
type
of
enactment
is
not
at
all
unusual
as
it's
been
pointed
out
by
mr.
justice
goldberg,
31
of
the
states
have
similar
enactments.
we
also
have
enactments
in
the
field
of
agriculture,
field
of
animal
husbandry,
and
practically,
all
of
the
special
fields
of
professional
care
of
human
beings,
similarly
important,
some
going
much
further
than
this.
it
seems
to
me
that,
if
we
should
fail
to
prevail
in
this
action
here,
that
it
would
let
the
bars
down
to
a
great
number
of
possible
evils
that
the
states
are
best
fitted
to
care
for.
the
solicitor
general
argues
preemption
so
far
as
the
radio
stations
are
concerned
under
the
federal
communications
act.
but
with
reference
to
the
particular
type
of
--
the
type
of
misdemeanor
here
committed,
is
a
nebulous
field
in
which
they
may
or
may
not
at
some
future
date
enter
into
the
field
of
to
take
care
of
them.
we
would
hope
and
assume
that
if
and
when
they
do
enter
the
field
that
they
will
see
the
wisdom
of
this
type
of
action,
this
type
of
enactment,
and
prohibit
under
their
regulation
this
type
of
advertising.
we
think
that
certainly
the
field
of
commercial
advertising
has
--
is
considerably
different
than
the
field
of
free
speech
that
we're
talking
about
two
different
things
entirely,
that
the
interest
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
is
such
that
we
have
devised
a
means
of
taking
care
of
these
local
instances
with
this
type
of
action
that
gets
immediate
action
whereas,
the
federal
communications
commission
indicates
they
might
take
in
consideration
in
renewal
of
a
license
of
which
the
state
has
no
notice
of
the
hearing
or
anything
in
connection
with
it.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
in
the
field
of
interstate
commerce,
your
honor,
i
--
we
would
possibly
have
to
defer
to
the
federal
government's
enactments
along
that
line.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
this
is
interstate
commerce,
insofar
as
the
advertising
is
concerned.
not
so
far
as
the
fitting
of
the
glasses
is
concern,
but
simply
as
far
as
the
advertising,
nothing
else.
but
even
there,
the
federal
government
has
not
seen
fit
to
move
in
and
make
regulation
concerning
this.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
in
the
matter
of
the
serving
of
the
water
in
new
mexico,
the
new
mexico
could
stop
it
under
their
police
powers,
your
honor.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
if
the
federal
government
had
moved
in
and
taken
over
in
a
preemptive
statute
or
regulation
concerning
the
advertising,
then
they
could
not
stop
the
advertising.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
the
test
would
be
whether
it
effectively
covers
the
specific
items,
your
honor.
and
the
--
i
cannot
conceive
of
a
situation
where
the
state
and
the
federal
government
would
be
so
far
removed
from
each
other
with
--
with
reference
to
scientific
data
concerning
these
matters.
but
assuming
that
they
were,
then
the
state
would
still
have
those
police
powers
for
the
protection
of
its
own
citizens
so
far
as
the
actual
sale
or
disposal
of
the
water
or
glasses
or
what
have
you
dealing
with
the
health
of
its
citizens.
the
commercial
end
of
the
thing
is
as
i
say
de
minimis,
very
local
situation.
even
in
this
instance,
dr.
roberts
could
have
continued
to
carry
a
respectable
type
of
name
advertising.
he
was
only
prohibited
from
advertising
prices
in
such
a
manner
as
would
induce
people
to
think
that
they
were
getting
some
special
bargains
by
going
to
him.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
that's
just
the
part
of
the
bait
advertising,
your
honor,
if
you
don't
know
what
you're
discounting
from,
designed
primarily
to
keep
from
baiting
the
people
into
buying
something
that
they
may
not
have
any
perfectly
use
for
whatsoever.
some
of
these
scholars
would
fit
you
with
window
panes
if
they
had
the
opportunity
to
charge
you
for
it.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
under
this
act,
it
is
a
crime
because
it
deals
with
the
health
of
the
persons
of
the
state
of
new
mexico.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
it's
not
matter
of
buying
at
a
discount,
mr.
justice
black.
it's
a
matter
of
being
enticed
into
examination
and
so
forth
by
this
type
of
bait
advertising.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
with
reference
to
eyeglasses,
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
that's
right,
mr.
justice
white.
it's
the
essential
thing;
it's
proper
care
of
the
eyes
and
the
preservation
of
eyesight.
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
we
are
--
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
the
profession
itself
we
hope
does
do
some
policing
of
its
memberships,
that's
the
same
as
the
grievance
committee
of
the
bar
associations,
under
those
types
of
things.
it's
the
ethics
of
the
profession
--
it
is
the
professional
standards
that
we
are
interested
in
and
that
our
citizens
may
secure
proper
professional
treatment.
we
would
assume
that
the
ethics
of
the
profession,
the
high
standards
required
in
new
mexico
would
also
protect
them
on
unconscionable
prices.
if
i
may,
i
would
refer
--
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
that's
true
and
of
course
in
that
respect,
the
food
and
drug
act
of
the
--
the
federal
food
and
drug
act
does
offer
protection
from
contaminated
food.
but
their
prices
--
mr.
earl
e.
hartley
yes,
mr.
justice
douglas.
your
rationale
there
is
well-stated
and
well-taken.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
defer
the
technical
end
of
this
argument
to
my
special
assistant
who
has
been
in
--
on
this
case
from
its
inception
to
date.
