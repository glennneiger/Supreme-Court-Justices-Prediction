ms.
carol
j.
head
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
an
injunction
by
the
state
of
new
mexico,
prohibiting
the
appellants
from
publishing
and
disseminating
certain
advertising
of
a
texas
optometrist.
the
appellant,
head,
owns
and
publishes
in
hobbs,
new
mexico
a
newspaper
called
the
hobbs
flare.
the
appellant,
permian
basin
radio
corporation
owns
and
operates
a
radio
broadcasting
station
in
hobbs,
new
mexico,
having
broadcast
coverage
in
both
new
mexico
and
texas
as
does
mrs.
head's
paper.
the
following
issues
are
presented
to
this
court
whether
the
injunction
is
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce
in
violation
of
the
commerce
clause
whether
as
to
the
radio
broadcasting
station
the
injunction
is
an
incursion
by
the
state
of
new
mexico
into
an
area
that
is
preempted
from
state
regulation
by
the
federal
communications
act
of
1934.
and
thus,
whether
this
incursion
is
superseded
by
our
--
is
violative
of
the
supremacy
clause.
thirdly,
whether
this
injunction
deprives
these
appellants
the
due
process
of
the
law
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
in
this
connection,
we
have
two
facets
to
our
argument.
the
first
is
that
the
prohibition
against
carrying
this
advertising,
there
is
no
real
or
substantial
relation
to
the
end
sought
to
be
achieved
by
the
state
of
new
mexico
in
adopting
this
law.
and
the
other
is
that
this
prohibition
against
these
advertising
communications
media
constitutes
an
abridgement
of
their
right
of
freedom
of
the
press
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
the
first
amendment
is
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth.
now,
in
this
connection,
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
appellee
has
raised
the
question
as
to
the
right
of
the
appellants
to
present
to
the
court
the
latter
issue,
we
dealt
with
this
initially
in
our
initial
brief
and
we
dealt
with
it
more
at
length
in
our
reply
brief,
i
would
like
to
just
raise
it
now
so
the
court
will
not
feel
that
i'm
trying
to
smuggle
in
as
mr.
justice
jackson
once
referred
to
this
practice
not
trying
to
smuggle
in
a
new
issue.
i
will
develop
how
this
issue
gets
before
the
court
at
a
later
point.
now
fourthly,
we
claim
that
the
injunction
deprives
the
appellant's
equal
protection
of
the
laws
in
violation
again
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
lastly,
as
to
the
appellant
head,
who
is
an
individual,
who
claimed
that
it
deprives
her
of
her
privileges
and
immunities
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
briefly,
the
facts
in
the
controversy
of
these,
the
appellant,
head,
as
i
stated,
is
an
individual
doing
business
under
the
trade
name
of
lea
county
publishing
company.
she
resides
in
hobbs,
new
mexico
and
publishes
there
a
newspaper
called
the
hobbs
flare.
this
paper
has
circulation
in
new
mexico
and
texas
some
27
communities
in
the
immediate
trade
area
as
well
as
some
13
other
states
and
the
district
of
columbia.
the
appellant,
permian
basin
radio
corporation
is
a
new
mexico
corporation
which
has
been
licensed
as
a
radio
broadcaster
by
the
federal
communications
commission.
its
facilities
are
located
in
hobbs,
new
mexico
but
its
broadcast
coverage
covers
both
new
mexico
and
texas.
i
might
mention
here
that
hobbs,
new
mexico
is
in
the
southeastern
part
of
new
mexico,
five
miles
from
the
texas
border
on
the
east
and
some
50
miles
from
the
texas
border
which
runs
south
of
it.
now,
the
appellee,
the
mexico
board
of
examiners
in
optometry
is
an
official
agency
of
the
state
of
new
mexico,
and
it
is
here
in
its
official
capacity.
it
is
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
laws
of
new
mexico
relating
to
the
practice
of
optometry
in
new
mexico.
and
the
law
which
is
under
attack
here
is
one
of
the
laws
that
they
were
charged
with
the
administration.
now,
conceiving
its
duty
to
include
prohibiting
advertising
media
such
as
the
appellants
from
disseminating
the
advertising
of
the
texas
optometrist,
the
appellee
in
september
1960
filed
in
the
district
court
for
lea
county,
new
mexico,
a
complaint
against
these
appellants
and
also
against
a
texas
optometrist
named
roberts
and
against
another
radio
station
named
kwew,
charging
them
with
a
violation
of
the
optometry
acts
of
new
mexico
and
seeking
to
enjoin
them
specifically
from
accepting
in
new
mexico
and
publishing
and
broadcasting
in
new
mexico
certain
advertising
of
this
optometrist,
roberts.
mr.
roberts
is
an
optometrist
who
resides
and
practices
optometry
across
the
state
line
in
texas
in
gaines
county
where
there
is
a
substantial
business
community.
he
is
not
a
party
to
this
appeal.
in
fact
that
no
time
did
he
ever
appear
before
the
new
mexico
courts.
he
apparently
was
served
with
process
in
texas
by
someone
in
texas.
and
based
on
this,
the
new
mexico
court,
some
two
weeks
before
this
case,
came
on
--
or
hearing
before
the
new
mexico
court,
entered
a
decree
against
roberts
enjoining
him
from
advertising
in
any
way,
in
any
media
in
new
mexico.
as
i
say,
some
two
weeks
later,
there
was
a
hearing
in
this
case
which
the
appellants
appeared,
having
previously
appeared
by
answer
and
having
previously
raised
essentially
the
same
constitutional
questions
which
they
have
raised
here.
at
this
hearing,
which
was
on
the
appellee's
motion
for
summary
judgment,
what
few
facts
are
in
the
record
were
elicited,
and
based
on
these,
the
district
judge
enjoin
the
appellants
from
disseminating
--
accepting
and
disseminating
in
new
mexico
certain
advertising
of
mr.
roberts.
now,
i
might
mention
something
about
the
evidence.
as
your
honors
will
see,
the
record
is
fairly
thin
in
this
case
but
i
think
the
evidence
does
show
quite
clearly
that
the
appellants
are
business
people
in
new
mexico,
that
they
had
accepted
advertising
from
an
optometrist
in
texas
and
that
they
are
now
restrained
from
doing
so
under
the
sanction
of
the
new
mexico
courts.
they
now
have
the
choice
either
of
abiding
by
that
and
not
disseminating
the
advertising
or
disseminating
the
advertising
and
facing
contempt
proceedings
in
the
new
mexico
courts.
ms.
carol
j.
head
in
part,
it
does
your
honor,
and
in
part,
it
does
not.
i
will
say
as
far
as
--
as
far
as
the
commerce
question,
i
think
it's
essential
that
--
at
least
it's
important
to
us
that
he
does
reside
in
texas.
if
he
were
a
new
mexico
optometrist,
the
only
argument
we
could
make
is
that
we
were
entitled
to
disseminate
this
because
we
are
in
interstate
commerce
and
that
we
broadcast
into
texas
and
send
papers
into
other
states.
i
think
we
will
have
difficulty
with
that
but
it
isn't
the
case
before
the
court,
so
i
would
prefer
not
to
--
not
to
take
a
definitive
position.
we
would
have
difficulty
with
it
in
view
of
this
court's
prior
decision
i
think
in
the
williamson
case.
i
might
mention
the
williamson
case
just
because
i
do
bring
it
up
at
this
point.
it's
a
case
that
the
appellee
has
made
a
great
deal
of
and
that
the
american
associate
--
optometric
association
which
has
filed
a
brief
as
amicus
curiae
has
also
made
a
great
deal
of.
in
fact,
that
case
has
no
bearing
at
all
on
the
issues
involved
in
this
case.
that
was
a
case
involving
an
oklahoma
statute
which
had
a
specific
proviso
excluding
from
its
coverage
any
advertising
media
which
might
publish
or
disseminate
advertising
of
persons
such
as
optometrist
or
opticians
or
ophthalmologist
who
were
covered
by
the
act.
secondly,
the
parties
to
the
action
were
opticians
and
ophthalmologists
and
no
advertising
media
was
in
any
way
involved.
and
in
fact,
all
this
court
held
was
that
the
act
is
applied
to
these
opticians
and
ophthalmologists
did
not
violate
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
there
was
perhaps
an
interstate
commerce
question
raised
in
that
case
which
was
the
question
i
adverted
to
earlier.
the
parties
in
the
case
tried
to
urge
apparently
that
because
they
advertise
their
services
endorsed
papers
in
interstate
commerce,
they
ought
to
be
immune
from
this
regulation
because
it
burdened
interstate
commerce.
the
court
did
not
deal
with
this
question
at
all
in
its
opinion
nor
did
the
lower
court,
the
district
court
in
oklahoma
deal
with
this
question.
so
we
submit
that
the
williamson
case
in
no
way
controls
this
case.
the
theory
of
the
district
judge
in
granting
the
injunction
against
these
appellants
was
that
they
were
engaged
in
the
conspiracy
to
aid
and
abet
roberts,
the
texas
optometrist
to
violate
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
mexico.
and
that
even
though
roberts
was
a
nonresident
and
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
over
him,
i
might
mention
here
that
the
district
court
specifically
said
roberts
is
a
nonresident
and
we
have
no
jurisdiction
over
him.
the
court
thought
that
nevertheless
because
it
conceived
this
to
be
a
conspiracy,
this
appellant
should
be
enjoined
from
disseminating
this
advertising,
and
accordingly
on
april
7,
1961,
he
entered
such
an
injunction.
now,
thereafter,
the
appellants
including
the
other
radio
station
which
is
not
a
party
to
this
appeal,
appealed
to
the
new
mexico
supreme
court.
they
raised
essentially
the
same
issues
raised
here
as
well
as
some
other
issues
which
are
not
now
raised.
new
mexico
supreme
court
affirmed
the
district
court
on
april
11,
1962
and
the
appellants
who
were
before
this
court
took
an
appeal
on
july
6.
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
november
13,
1962.
and
at
that
time,
while
the
issue
had
been
raised
in
the
body
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
but
had
not
been
separately
stated,
the
court
asked
that
the
parties
address
themselves
to
the
preemption
problem,
preemption
by
the
federal
communications
act
and
invited
the
solicitor
general
to
state
the
views
of
the
fcc.
i
think
it's
clear,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
purpose
of
the
commerce
clause
was
to
avoid
rivalries
among
the
states,
to
avoid
the
raising
of
economic
barriers
and
to
avoid
the
imposition
by
one
state
of
its
standards
on
another
state.
ms.
carol
j.
head
i
submit
that
they
could
not,
your
honor.
ms.
carol
j.
head
i
submit
they
could
not.
ms.
carol
j.
head
well,
i
might
say
that
on
the
preemption
ground,
this
only
applies
to
one
of
the
two
appellants
because
mrs.
head
the
radio
station
have
no
relation
to
each
other
although
this
doesn't
appear
in
the
record.
i
don't
think
there
could
be
any
dispute.
i
would
say
on
both
grounds
because
while
roberts,
i
might
mention
was
once
licensed
to
practice
optometry
in
new
mexico,
the
fact
is
and
the
record
reflects
it
that
he
is
now
practicing
and
residing
solely
in
texas
and
nothing
in
any
of
the
decisions
or
rulings
of
the
new
mexico
district
court
or
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
in
anyway
suggest
that
they
were
fitting
this
on
the
basis
that
he
was
once
licensed
in
new
mexico
because
they're
trying
to
get
him
because
he's
in
effect
advertising
in
new
mexico
in
a
trade
territory
that
comprises
both
new
mexico
and
texas.
so
i
would
say
that
both
arguments
would
apply
that
even
if
they
have
beyond
jurisdiction
over
him,
in
the
sense
of
physically
serving
him
that
process
in
new
mexico.
i
don't
think
the
state
of
new
mexico
validly
could
enjoin
him
either
from
disseminating,
advertising
in
media
like
this
in
connection
with
his
practice
in
texas.
ms.
carol
j.
head
there
isn't
any
claim
that
that
is
the
case
--
ms.
carol
j.
head
i
might
have
to
concede,
your
honor
that
you
could
--
there
are
--
there
would
be
some
limits
in
the
case
of
fraud
and
crime
in
this
sort
of
thing.
however,
here,
the
statute
is
not
in
any
sense
aimed
that
fraud.
ms.
carol
j.
head
it's
simply
an
economic
statute
that
is
aimed
at
price
advertising
and
the
stipulation
in
the
record
which
is
what
the
case
was
tried
on
is
simply
that
these
appellants
accepted
from
this
optometrist
in
texas
price
advertising,
they
simply
stated
at
what
prices
he
would
sell
glasses
and
perform
services.
so
there
isn't
any
suggestion
of
fraud.
i
would
agree
to
that
where
crimes
of
that
nature
committed,
how
that
has
to
limit
the
scope
of
my
argument.
but
i
submit
that
that
isn't
the
case
here.
ms.
carol
j.
head
sir?
ms.
carol
j.
head
well,
i
think
there
is,
yes.
the
--
insofar
as
the
health
argument
is
concerned,
i
think
the
state
of
new
mexico
makes
much
--
too
much
out
of
it.
they
have
admitted
it
in
their
brief
that
citizens
of
new
mexico
are
free
to
travel
because
i
think
they
would
have
to
in
view
of
edwards
versus
california
free
to
travel
off
from
new
mexico
to
texas
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
services
or
materials
for
glasses
from
roberts.
it
also
admitted
that
roberts
could
advertise
in
media
in
texas
even
though
it
might
come
in
to
new
mexico
and
be
heard
and
read
by
the
state
of
--
by
people
in
new
mexico.
now,
i
submit
that
the
only
thing
left
that
they're
simply
trying
to
prevent
people
from
learning
that
roberts
exists
and
i
submit
that
the
relation
to
the
health
of
the
citizens
of
new
mexico
doesn't
give
them
a
sufficient
time
that
they're
justified
in
imposing
on
roberts
the
standards
that
new
mexico
conceives
that
optometrist
thought
to
adhere
to,
the
fact
is
that
texas
does
not
have
a
statute
similar
to
this
of
new
mexico.
it
does
not
prohibit
truthful
price
advertising.
new
mexico
--
sir?
ms.
carol
j.
head
yes
sir.
i
would
say
that
if
gambling
is
legal
say
in
texas
or
in
nevada,
i
take
it,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
if
it's
legal
in
nevada,
i
submit
that
residents
in
new
mexico
cannot
be
foreclosed
by
the
state
of
new
mexico
from
learning
of
this
and
if
they
desire,
traveling
to
nevada
for
that
legitimate
purpose,
the
purpose
which
would
be
legitimate
in
nevada.
ms.
carol
j.
head
i
would
say
yes
sir,
because
i
think
in
fact
this
is
--
this
is
what
the
commerce
clause
boils
down
to.
otherwise,
we
have
a
state
like
in
mexico
imposing
on
other
states
its
own
standards.
now,
let
me
emphasize
--
ms.
carol
j.
head
yes.
there
have
been
--
ms.
carol
j.
head
i
don't
think
any
of
the
exceptions
are
applicable
to
this
type
of
situation
and
i
would
like
to
amplify
how
far
states
go
in
making
a
health
argument.
because
i
think
the
same
thing
is
applicable
here.
this
sort
of
price
statute
prohibiting
price
advertising
has
been
attempted
with
respect
to
barbers,
it
has
been
attempted
with
respect
to
embalmers,
it
has
been
attempted
with
respect
to
other
advertising
gasoline.
in
the
case
of
meyer
versus
nebraska
and
which
this
court
held
the
state
could
not
prohibit
the
teaching
in
public
school
or
in
private
schools
either
of
foreign
languages.
the
argument
was
even
made
as
a
suggestion
currently
because
it's
noted
in
the
court's
opinion
specifically
that
the
prohibition
was
aimed
at
protecting
the
health
of
the
children
by
limiting
their
mental
activities.
so
you
see
this
--
i
submit
that
the
state's
given
leeway
to
announce
that
anything
is
done
in
the
interest
of
the
health
of
their
citizens.
no
known
limits.
and
i
submit
that
they
should
have
limits
when
it
comes
to
imposing
their
standards
on
other
states.
does
that
answer
your
question,
sir?
now,
we
submit
that
there
are
no
cases
completely
similar
to
this
case
that
has
been
decided
by
this
court.
perhaps
the
most
analogous
case
is
that
of
baldwin
versus
seelig
in
which
new
york
attempted
to
prohibit
in
new
york
the
sale
of
milk
purchased
in
vermont
unless
that
milk
had
been
purchased
in
vermont
from
farmers
at
a
minimum
price
equal
or
greater
than
the
price
paid
farmers
for
milk
in
new
york.
based
with
that
situation,
this
court
held
that
this
violated
the
commerce
clause
that
this
was
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce
because
it
was
an
imposition
by
new
york
of
its
economic
standards
on
vermont.
and
there
again,
the
state
of
new
york
made
the
argument
that
this
was
done
in
the
interest
of
sanity
and
health,
sanitary
conditions
and
health
that
imposing
higher
economic
standards
would
make
farmers
have
cleaner
milk
and
more
sanitary
milk
and
this
would
benefit
the
health
of
the
citizens
of
new
york.
this
court
rejected
that
argument
and
said
that
the
economic
standards
for
vermont
would
have
been
set
by
vermont
if
there
is
a
problem.
we
submit
that
here,
this
is
analogous
because
in
effect,
the
state
of
new
mexico
is
attempting
to
establish
in
texas
as
to
a
texas
optometrist,
the
standards
that
it
conceives
ought
to
be
adhered
to
by
optometrist
in
new
mexico.
we
submit
that
these
appellants
are
victims
of
that
imposition
of
the
standard
and
that
this
burdens
commerce.
now,
i
will
agree
that
this
case
in
and
of
itself
involving
the
advertising
of
eyeglasses
with
appellants
such
as
these
who
frankly
are
not
large
businesses,
they
seem
somewhat
insignificant
but
i
submit
that
this
case
has
a
more
far
reaching
consequence
if
the
decision
should
be
in
favor
of
the
appellee.
there
are
many
such
border
communities.
there
are
many
such
areas
in
the
country
where
towns
are
situated
side
by
side,
for
instance
new
york
city
and
new
jersey
or
covington,
kentucky
and
cincinnati
and
ohio.
and
all
over
the
country,
you
can
find
situations
where
people
in
effect
have
intercommunication
economically
and
where
it
would
create
chaos
i
think
for
one
state
to
be
able
to
impose
its
standards
on
another
where
in
fact
the
purpose
or
at
least
the
effect
would
be
to
prevent
people
from
one
city
from
going
to
the
other
--
to
the
economic
betterment
of
the
people
for
whom
they
might
trade
with
or
whom
they
might
trade
in
their
own
city.
i
think
in
fact,
that
is
what
this
statute
as
applied
to
these
appellants
really
has
aimed
that.
ms.
carol
j.
head
i
don't
know
of
any
state
that
tolerates
the
advertising
by
lawyers,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
but
if
a
state
did,
i
would
say
that
certainly
if
it's
--
if
a
lawyer
from
say
new
mexico
or
say
texas
which
authorized
advertising
by
texas
lawyers,
tried
to
advertise
in
new
mexico
that
he
would
perform
legal
services
for
people
in
new
mexico.
let's
say
a
period
in
the
court
or
something
like
that,
i
submit
that
that
would
be
a
different
case
than
saying
that
he
is
a
lawyer
in
texas.
his
services
are
available.
if
they
want
to
come
there
and
use
them,
they
may
do
so.
i
submit
that
that
advertising
should
be
permissible
if
texas
conceives
that
its
interests
are
such
that
advertising
by
lawyers
is
permitted.
now,
aside
from
the
baldwin
case,
there
have
been
a
number
of
state
cases
in
which
the
problem
of
prohibiting
advertising
media
such
as
newspapers
have
arisen.
the
first
one
i
might
mention,
i
try
to
think
is
most
pertinent
is
state
versus
salt
lake
tribune
co.
which
we've
cited
in
our
initial
brief
at
page
14.
there,
utah
court
reversed
the
conviction
of
a
utah
paper
which
circulated
in
utah
and
also
in
interstate
commerce
for
publishing
in
utah
the
advertising
of
cigarettes.
it
was
lawful
to
sell
cigarettes
in
utah
at
the
time.
it
was
not
lawful
to
advertise
them.
the
court
said
that
this
was
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
it
didn't
decide
on
any
other
ground
that
this
was
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
on
the
other
hand,
in
--
a
post
printing
and
publishing
company
case
which
i
also
cite
at
the
same
place,
united
states
district
court
in
kansas
had
converse
of
the
situation
we
have
here.
they
have
the
question
of
a
kansas
newspaper
published
in
missouri,
circulated
in
kansas
and
carrying
advertising
of
cigarettes,
the
advertising
of
cigarettes
being
lawful
in
missouri
but
not
being
lawful
in
kansas.
from
there
again,
the
district
court
in
that
case
said
that
this
was
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
and
so
our
third
case,
little
versus
smith
which
is
a
kansas
case
on
facts
similar
to
the
salt
lake
tribune
case,
court
held
that
prohibiting
a
newspaper
published
in
kansas
from
carrying
this
advertising
of
cigarettes
by
a
firm
outside
of
kansas,
denied
the
newspaper
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
due
process
and
its
privileges
and
immunities
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
it
didn't
reach
the
question
of
whether
this
was
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
but
i
think
the
case
is
relevant.
now,
the
only
cases
is
in
fact
in
this
area
that
are
contrary
to
the
position
taken
by
these
appellants
are
cases
involving
the
prohibition
of
the
advertising
of
liquor,
intoxicating
liquor.
and
it
was
on
this
line
of
cases
that
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
relied
in
deciding
this
case.
they
stated
that
they
were
in
agreement
with
the
reasoning
of
the
court
in
j.p.
bass
publishing
company
which
we
also
cite
in
our
initial
brief
at
length.
in
that
case,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
maine
upheld
the
conviction
of
a
publisher
in
maine
for
publishing
in
maine,
a
newspaper
carrying
advertising
of
liquor
for
sale
in
massachusetts,
liquor
being
legally
for
sale
in
massachusetts
but
not
legally
for
sale
in
maine.
the
court
was
presented
with
the
argument
that
this
burdened
interstate
commerce
and
it
said
no.
how
the
reliance
of
the
court
in
that
case
was
on
this
court's
case
in
delamater
versus
south
dakota
which
i
think
makes
very
clear
that
liquor
is
a
special
commodity.
this
court
has
said
in
delamater
and
in
other
cases
that
congress
by
the
wilson
act
and
other
acts
has
removed
from
the
protection
of
the
commerce
clause
such
things
as
liquor
and
this
was
the
sole
basis
of
the
delamater
case.
the
court
said
that
if
something
other
than
liquor
were
involved
there
would
have
a
different
question.
so
it
didn't
decide
the
case
on
any
other
basis.
i
might
mention
that
the
delamater
case
did
not
involve
newspapers
or
other
communications
media,
it
involved
a
salesman
who
had
come
in
to
south
dakota
and
then
sold
or
solicited
orders
for
liquor
without
a
license
as
required
by
south
dakota
law.
now,
the
evil
as
we
conceive
it
of
new
mexico's
prohibition
against
these
appellants
disseminating
the
advertising
of
roberts
is
not
only
that
it
prohibits
new
mexico
residents
from
learning
that
roberts
is
there,
it
also
prohibits
those
persons
in
texas
who
might
use
these
communications
media
for
their
information
from
knowing
that
roberts
exist
also.
this
is
particularly
so
in
the
case
of
the
radio
broadcast
station
who
in
broadcast
coverage
in
terms
of
geographic
area
is
in
fact
larger
in
texas
by
virtue
of
the
geographic
location
of
hobbs
than
in
new
mexico.
now,
how
many
people
are
in
texas
and
new
mexico
in
the
comparative
areas,
the
record
doesn't
show.
we
submit
that
the
fact
that
texas
residents
are
also
foreclosed
by
this
injunction
from
learning
that
roberts
exist
and
will
perform
services
or
sell
commodities
at
a
certain
price,
emphasizes
the
burden
that
this
injunction
has
on
interstate
commerce.
now,
when
you
multiply
this
by
other
newspapers
of
more
significant
circulation
than
that
of
mrs.
head
or
other
broadcast
stations
having
wider
broadcast
coverage
than
that
of
the
appellant
here,
i
think
the
case
is
a
more
significant
--
presents
a
more
significant
problem
than
it
would
appear.
ms.
carol
j.
head
yes,
sir.
that
was
the
same
--
the
same
wattage
of
the
other
station
which
was
involved
too.
ms.
carol
j.
head
well,
the
record
doesn't
show
that
there
are,
having
grown
up
out
there
i
can
say
that
there
are.
there
is
a
station
some
25
miles
away
in
seminole,
texas.
i
think
there
is
a
small
paper
in
seminole,
texas
and
there
are
in
the
other
areas,
other
communities
in
both
texas
and
new
mexico.
there
are
other
papers
--
ms.
carol
j.
head
yes,
he
did.
i
wouldn't
say
the
outskirts
of
hobbs.
hobbs
is
about
five
miles
from
the
border,
mr.
justice
white.
it's
a
community
of
some
25,000
and
between
the
end
of
hobbs
and
the
state
line,
there
is
perhaps
three
miles
of
--
or
two
miles
of
--
ms.
carol
j.
head
of
whatever
there
is
there.
ms.
carol
j.
head
well,
there
is
--
i
might
say
that
the
record
doesn't
reflect
the
facts
on
this
so
whatever
i
state,
i
want
it
to
be
understood
that
this
is
--
this
is
just
based
on
my
knowledge
of
the
area.
there
is
a
community
out
there.
there
are
businesses
out
there.
it's
not
a
substantial
community
but
there
are
a
number
of
businesses
out
there.
there
are
a
number
of
gasoline
stations
for
instance
which
were,
i
believe,
specifically
are
--
which
i
think
did
specifically
grow
up
because
--
ms.
carol
j.
head
let's
say
it
starts
right
across
the
border
and
extends
perhaps
for
a
mile,
starting
along
the
highway.
it's
a
border
--
ms.
carol
j.
head
other
than
the
fact
that
there
are
differences
in
the
state
laws.
ms.
carol
j.
head
and
prices.
i
would
say
this
is
so.
and
i
--
ms.
carol
j.
head
oh
yes,
very
definitely.
ms.
carol
j.
head
i'm
sure
--
i'm
sure
he
would
expect.
i
wouldn't
say
the
biggest
part,
i'm
sure
to
expect
some.
now,
the
record
again
doesn't
reflect
this
because
roberts
had
no
time
appeared
before
the
new
mexico
courts.
so
we
don't
know
really
where
all
he
got
his
people
from.
ms.
carol
j.
head
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
if
i
did,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
--
at
one
time,
he
was
located
in
hobbs.
now,
why
he
moved
out,
i
don't
know.
ms.
carol
j.
head
there
--
i
think
he
was
at
one
time.
at
least
he
was
licensed
now.
whether
he
was
i
don't
really
know.
the
record
doesn't
reflect
it.
perhaps
these
gentlemen
on
their
argument
could
tell
you
because
they
live
in
the
community
now.
i
have
been
there
for
number
of
years
so
i
don't
really
know
whether
he
once
lived
in
hobbs
or
not.
he
was
once
licensed
by
the
state
of
new
mexico
whether
he
ever
practiced
being
in
the
state
of
new
mexico,
the
record
doesn't
show
and
i
don't
know.
i'd
like
to
take
just
one
example
of
another
statute
of
the
state
of
new
mexico
regulating
advertising
by
business
persons.
i
don't
know
whether
they
would
conceive
that
this
has
any
relation
to
the
health
of
the
people
or
not
but
at
least
it's
a
restriction
on
advertising.
section
47-11-14
of
the
new
mexico
statutes
which
provide
that
owners
of
stallions
that
are
not
purebred
was
not
for
any
advertising
calling
attention
to
the
stallion
as
a
breed
unless
--
as
a
breed
--
unless
the
advertising
has
the
word
scrub
or
grade
in
one
inch
letters
in
front
of
the
word
stallion.
i
take
this
situation,
suppose
the
appellant
head,
got
an
advertisement
from
a
man
in
oklahoma
and
he
said
he
was
going
to
have
a
stallion
auction.
she
would
be
faced
with
the
problem
of
asking
him
first,
“are
these
purebred?”
first,
you
would
be
faced
with
the
problem
of
learning
that
the
specific
restriction
exists
then
she
would
be
asked
faced
with
the
problem
of
asking
the
man,
are
these
purebred
stallions?
if
so,
you
must
put
this
before
it.
in
fact,
she
would
have
to
administer
the
statute
instead
of
relying
on
the
state
to
go
after
the
man
in
oklahoma.
now,
even
if
he
told
her
that
they
were
purebreds,
if
they
turned
out
not
to
be
purebreds,
she
would
be
faced
with
the
problem
that
she
has
nevertheless
disseminated
advertising
in
new
mexico
or
to
oklahoma
who
has
advertised
stallions
that
were
not
purebred
in
violation
of
this
law.
now,
this
law
doesn't
say
any
person
who
advertises
it.
it
says
the
owner
of
the
stallion
but
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
in
enjoining
these
appellants
and
i
think
the
reasoning
of
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
was
that
they
were
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
to
aid
and
abet
roberts.
you
could
apply
the
same
situation
with
respect
to
stallions.
you
could
argue
under
any
states,
general
conspiracy
laws
that
anyone
promulgating
or
disseminating
any
advertising
for
the
advertiser
is
in
effect
aiding
and
abetting
the
violation
of
the
law
and
is
in
a
conspiracy.
so
even
though
the
specific
statute
might
not
refer
to
any
person,
i
think
the
danger
is
there
that
the
state
could
apply
it
particularly
if
what
new
mexico
attempts
here
is
upheld.
on
the
preemption
problem
to
which
this
court
specifically
asked
the
parties
to
address
themselves
and
invited
the
solicitor
general
to
state
the
views
of
the
federal
communications
commission,
i
would
like
to
limit
my
argument
somewhat
in
that.
i've
dealt
with
it
at
length
in
my
initial
brief
and
in
my
reply
brief.
because
of
the
time,
i
would
like
to
defer
some
of
that
and
leave
it
to
the
solicitor
general
who
i
know
is
going
to
cover
the
field.
essentially,
we
are
in
agreement
with
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
insofar
as
it
applies
to
this
particular
advertising.
i
think
beyond
that,
there
are
some
suggestions
made
which
we
--
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief
that
we
do
not
subscribe
to
but
i
think
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
those
are
unimportant.
we
believe
that
the
federal
communications
act
does
preempt
what
new
mexico
has
attempted
to
do
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
this
court's
prior
decisions
in
such
cases
as
the
national
broadcasting
company
case
and
the
sanders
brothers
case
leave
no
doubt
that
congress
as
its
intent
has
been
construed
by
this
court,
intended
a
pervasive
scheme
of
regulation
with
respect
to
radio
broadcasting.
i
would
like
to
mention
just
one
case
which
we
believe
is
quite
similar
and
this
is
a
case
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
it's
a
case
of
dumont
laboratories
versus
carroll
which
we've
dealt
with
at
length
in
our
briefs.
there,
the
state
of
pennsylvania
tried
to
apply
its
censorship
statutes
so
as
to
prohibit
the
carrying
on
television
of
films,
movie
films,
until
they
have
been
censored
or
checked
for
censorship
by
the
pennsylvania
censorship
commission.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
as
had
the
lower
court,
considered
that
that
was
an
intrusion
by
pennsylvania
into
an
area
that
had
been
preempted
from
state
regulation
by
the
communications
act.
ms.
carol
j.
head
well,
this
--
it's
true
that
that
--
the
pennsylvania
statute
was
key
to
obscenity
but
it
all
--
i
think
it
was
a
little
broader,
mr.
justice
harlan.
it
also
had
the
term
sacrilegious
which
is
the
term
that
this
court
had
trouble
with
in
the
bernstein
case.
and
i
submit
that
interpretations
of
the
various
words
in
the
pennsylvania
statute
could
be
much
broader
than
for
instance
affecting
--
adversely
affecting
public
moral
that
sort
of
thing,
this
lead
to
broad
interpretations.
so
i
think
the
case
is
analogous
and
that
the
preemption
wasn't
solely
because
the
federal
communications
act
has
some
specific
language
with
respect
to
obscenity.
now,
the
third
--
our
third
argument
is
one
on
due
process.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
appellee
has
questioned
the
right
of
the
appellants
to
raise
this
issue
insofar
as
it
relates
to
free
speech.
now,
the
case
when
it
was
before
the
district
court
of
new
mexico
and
when
it
was
before
the
supreme
court
of
new
mexico
did
not
specifically
mentioned
freedom
of
the
press.
the
issue
was
raised
solely
in
terms
of
deprivation
of
property
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
we
face
--
we're
on
the
two
problems.
one
is
that
the
argument
was
simply
that
this
was
a
deprivation
of
property
whereas
this
court
has
talked
in
terms
of
deprivation
of
liberty
of
the
press.
i
dealt
with
this
in
my
initial
brief
and
i
submit
that
there
at
least
is
some
substance
to
our
appeal.
beyond
that,
i
submit
that
the
other
problem
is
that
this
is
commercial
advertising.
but
in
no
case
of
this
court,
has
the
court
ever
said
that
advertising
under
these
circumstances
is
not
entitled
to
the
constitutional
protections
afforded
other
information
that
might
be
disseminated.
there
are
cases
such
as
valentine
versus
chrestensen
in
which
this
court
held
that
you
could
not
distribute
under
the
protection
of
freedom
of
the
press
or
freedom
of
speech
handles
in
new
york
city.
i
think
that's
a
much
different
case
than
saying
to
a
radio
broadcast
station
or
a
newspaper
which
are
engaged
in
the
business
of
disseminated
--
disseminating
not
only
commercial
advertising
but
other
information
as
well
and
for
whose
livelihood
advertising
is
essential.
i
submit
that
this
is
a
totally
different
case
that
was
involved
in
valentine.
the
same
is
true
of
cusack
versus
the
city
of
chicago
in
which
this
court
held
that
billboards
carrying
advertising
could
be
prohibited.
i
think
this
is
again
is
a
much
different
case
and
i
think
the
rationale
of
the
court's
decision
in
cusack
case
would
show
that.
and
i
think
the
same
is
true
of
the
railway
express
case
which
is
relied
on
i
think
by
the
appellee.
there,
railway
express
which
operates
trucks
with
advertising
on
the
sides
was
prohibited
from
operating
its
trucks
in
new
york
city
streets
with
the
advertising
even
though
some
of
these
trucks
move
in
both
new
york
and
new
jersey.
now,
we
submit
that
the
rationale
of
the
court's
decision
was
one
based
on
regulation
of
local
traffic.
and
we
think
that
it
was
limited
to
that
specific
type
of
situation
that
it
shouldn't
be
applied
to
this
one.
the
last
due
process
point
is
simply
that
the
regulation
here
attempted
doesn't
bear
that
real
and
substantial
relation
to
the
object
of
the
legislation
the
due
process
requires.
the
state
has
admitted
that
these
people
can
travel
to
texas,
that
advertising
from
other
media
can
come
in
to
new
mexico
even
though
this
means
that
these
residents
of
new
mexico
will
hear
or
might
hear
and
read
this
same
type
of
advertising.
so
this
leaves
the
sole
effect
as
to
prevent
people
from
learning
from
these
appellants
that
roberts
is
in
texas
performing
these
services.
we
submit
that
this
runs
to
follow
this
court's
prior
decisions
as
to
what
is
compatible
with
due
process
under
similar
circumstances.
now,
the
state
supreme
court,
i
think
in
relying
on
the
j.p.
bass
publishing
company
case
in
effect
admitted
that
it
would
view
differently
out
of
state
newspapers
coming
in
to
the
state
of
new
mexico
in
carrying
the
same
advertising.
and
i
think
this
is
the
position
of
the
appellee
that
this
would
not
be
prohibited
by
the
state
of
new
mexico.
if
this
is
so,
then
we
submit
that
this
is
a
denial
to
these
appellants
of
equal
protection
because
here
are
the
people
in
the
same
area
trying
to
carry
the
same
advertising,
two
of
whom
because
they
are
located
in
new
mexico
are
restrained
from
doing
so
but
others
of
whom
because
they
are
outside
the
state
might
be
allowed
by
the
state
to
carry
the
same
information.
we
submit
that
this
is
as
to
them
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
i
like,
if
i
might,
to
cut
my
argument
short
and
reserve
the
last
few
minutes
please.
ms.
carol
j.
head
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
stated
in
my
earlier
argument,
if
appellee
has
repeated
here,
has
conceded
that
new
mexico
cannot
and
will
not
attempt
in
any
way
to
prevent
any
advertising
from
the
state
of
texas
from
coming
in
to
new
mexico
via
papers
or
radio
broadcast.
all
there's
attempting
to
do
here
is
prevent
these
appellants
who
might
compete
in
papers
and
radio
broadcast
stations
in
texas
from
disseminating
the
same
advertising
which
they
will
not
attempt
to
prevent
from
coming
in.
now,
we
submit
that
this
discrimination
certainly
should
not
be
tolerated
under
the
prior
cases
of
this
court
that
we've
previously
discussed.
ms.
carol
j.
head
i
think
this
was
perhaps
a
tougher
case
than
gambling
but
i'd
say
no.
i
would
say
no.
i
would
say
that
if
--
if
we
--
if
we
accept
the
policy
that
each
state
as
to
various
activities
such
as
gambling
and
prostitution
or
advertising
by
professionals
is
entitled
to
set
its
own
public
policy.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
texas
sets
a
public
policy
that
is
different,
then
the
public
policy
set
by
new
mexico
consistent
with
the
du
--
the
commerce
clause,
certainly,
new
mexico
cannot
impose
its
standards
on
texas.
i
would
apply
this
to
that
situation.
although
admittedly,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
it's
something
that
might
not
be
tasteful
to
people
in
new
mexico.
but
the
fact
that
it
is
not
tasteful
to
people
in
new
mexico,
it
seems
to
me
leaves
them
with
recourse
to
congress
and
i
think
perhaps
under
the
mann
act,
there
may
be
a
proscription
under
this
by
virtue
of
congressional
enactment.
i
don't
know
whether
the
mann
act
really
applies
to
advertising
this
enactment,
i'm
sorry.
but
we
submit
that
certainly,
when
you
consider
in
this
case
that
the
optometrist
is
in
texas,
his
advertising
originates
with
him.
he
performs
his
services
in
texas
that
the
case
should
not
turn
on
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
the
type
is
set
in
new
mexico
or
the
radio
broadcasting
voice
starts
in
new
mexico,
that
the
advertising,
in
a
more
ultimate
sense,
has
started
in
texas
and
it
relates
to
the
services
to
be
performed
in
texas,
and
we
submit
that
this
is
an
interstate
transaction
which
is
entitled
to
protection
under
the
commerce
clause.
now,
there
are
some
points
i
would
like
to
make
very
quickly.
one
is
that
both
counsel
for
the
appellee
have
referred
to
this
as
bait
and
switch
advertising.
the
record
will
show
that
the
only
thing
these
appellants
carried
was
price
advertising.
i
don't
want
the
court
to
get
the
impression
that
this
was
something
more
odious
than
it
was
because
it
was
simply
ba
--
simply
price
advertising.
another
point
made
by
the
appellee
is
that
the
dumont
case
involved
censorship
in
terms
of
obscenity
and
that
sort
of
thing.
now,
the
statute
involved
in
that
case
actually
provides
that
the
pennsylvania
board
and
i'm
quoting,
“shall
examine
or
supervise
the
examinations
of
all
the
films,
reels
or
views
to
be
exhibited
or
used
in
pennsylvania
shall
approve
such
films,
reels
or
views
which
are
moral
and
proper,
and
shall
disapprove
such
as
are
sacrilegious,
obscene,
indecent,
or
immoral
are
such
as
tend
in
the
judgment
of
board
to
the
base
of
corrupt
morals.”
i
submit
that
this
is
a
far
broader
statute
than
any
of
provisions
that
might
have
been
involved
in
the
sections
of
the
federal
communications
commission
act
that
the
dumont
opinion
mentioned.
ms.
carol
j.
head
it
is
indeed
and
i
think
that
vaguer
the
statute
more
leeway
aboard
administering
it
has
historically,
mr.
justice
stewart.
at
least
more
leeway
they've
exercised.
now
the
--
ms.
carol
j.
head
yes
sir,
it
is.
ms.
carol
j.
head
we
have
not
presented
it.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question.
it
does
say
cover
prices
and
these
appellants
have
conceded
that
they
carried
price
advertising.
this
was
simply
all
it
carried.
ms.
carol
j.
head
sir?
ms.
carol
j.
head
unfortunately,
mr.
justice
black,
the
record
does
not
show
the
text
of
any
of
the
advertisements.
i
don't
know
why
this
is
--
ms.
carol
j.
head
i
can't
get
any
advantage
out
of
them,
but
i
don't
think
the
other
side
should
get
any
advantage
out
of
their
absence
either,
sir.
ms.
carol
j.
head
it
stipulated
in
the
record
that
these
appellants
have
accepted
price
advertising.
that's
the
only
word
that
you
mentioned
in
the
record
in
any
sense
as
to
what
these
appellants
have
done
which
the
appellee
claims
violates
the
statute.
this
was
done
by
stipulation
on
the
appellant's
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
stipulation
was
that
these
appellants
had
accepted
price
advertising.
there
was
no
stipulation
that
they
had
accepted
anything
else
and
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
shows
that
they
had
accepted
anything
else.
now,
the
appellee
also
mentioned
with
some
apparent
significance
to
the
case
of
semler
versus
dental
examiners.
we
submit
that
that
has
absolutely
no
relevance
to
this
case,
with
the
case
involving
--
i'm
sorry.
ms.
carol
j.
head
that
was
the
case
involving
the
question
of
whether
the
state
of
oregon
could
revoke
the
license
of
a
dentist
in
oregon,
practicing
in
oregon
for
certain
practices
including
price
advertising.
the
court
said
that
the
license
could
be
revoked
but
of
course,
there
was
no
media
involved,
no
newspaper
or
radio
broadcast
station
and
there
is
no
interstate
commerce
involved.
it
was
simply
a
case
along
the
lines
of
the
williamson
versus
lee
optical
company
case.
so
we
submit
that
it
can't
have
any
controlling
elements
here.
we've
dealt
with
it
at
length
in
both
of
our
briefs.
and
we
--
i
just
want
to
emphasize
it.
ms.
carol
j.
head
yes,
sir?
ms.
carol
j.
head
no
sir,
there
is
none.
the
--
on
page
--
ms.
carol
j.
head
yes,
sir,
that's
my
understanding.
this
is
all
that's
involved
in
this
case.
thank
you.
