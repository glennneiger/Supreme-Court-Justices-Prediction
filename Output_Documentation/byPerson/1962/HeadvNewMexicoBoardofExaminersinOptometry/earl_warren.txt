chief
justice
earl
warren
general
is
there
no
legislative
history
of
any
kind
on
this
subject
to
indicate
that
congress
considered
it
one
way
or
the
other?
chief
justice

yes.
chief

yes.
chief

warren
yes.
chief

earl
warren
mr.
hartley,
and
should
you
need
five
minutes
more,
you
may
have
it
--
you
may
have
them
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
thanks.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
suppose
the
government
and
the
state
should
conflict
on
some
health
policies.
let's
take
an
issue
like
fluoridation
of
water
and
suppose
the
national
government
believe
that
it
was
in
the
interest
of
public
health
to
encourage
fluoridation
of
water,
and
it
would
extend
--
give
money
to
cities
and
counties
in
water
districts
to
do
that
with
water.
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
state
should
say
that
it
is
against
its
public
policy
--
its
health
policy
to
have
such
a
thing
and
it
prohibited
the
fluoridation
of
water
or
the
advertising
of
any
water
company
to
the
effect
that
it
did
fluoridate
its
water.
what
--
what
would
the
situation
be
then?
which
would
prevail
with
the
--
would
you
be
able
to
prevent
them
from
doing
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
this
interstate
commerce?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
you
have
a
water
works
in
texas
that
serve
water
in
new
mexico
and
you
have
the
situation
arise
that
is
legal
in
--
legal
in
texas
and
was
not
legal
in
new
mexico?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
could
they
stop
the
radio
station
from
advertising
that
the
texas
company
does
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there's
a
test
whether
the
government
effectively
closes
all
the
loopholes
or
whether
it
just
intends
to
cover
the
subject.
