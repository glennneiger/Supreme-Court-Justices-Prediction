mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
has
filed
a
brief
in
this
case
and
requested
time
to
take
part
in
the
oral
argument
because
it
involves
the
interplay
between
two
major
regulatory
statutes,
the
securities
exchange
act
and
the
sherman
act.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
in
the
beginning
to
try
to
put
the
case
in
a
nutshell.
the
stock
exchange
has
a
long
standing
published
rule
which
forbids
its
members
to
maintain
direct
wire
connections
without
the
approval
of
the
exchange
and
to
terminate
any
wire
connection
when
requested
by
the
exchange.
in
this
case,
it
invoked
that
published
rule
against
a
non-member,
apparently
in
the
honest
belief
that
the
nonmember,
the
petitioner,
lacked
integrity
and
reliability.
and
that
such
action
was
therefore
appropriate
to
carry
out
the
exchanges'
obligation
and
its
members'
obligation
under
the
securities
exchange
act
to
require
its
members
to
adhere
to
just
and
equitable
principles
of
trade.
the
exchanges'
investigation
into
the
particular
facts
with
respect
to
the
petitioner
was
so
inadequate
and
the
conclusions
that
it
drew
from
the
evidence
that
it
did
gather
were
so
unreasonable,
that
the
district
court
had
stated
that
the
exchange
had
acted
arbitrarily
and
unreasonably.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disagree
with
that
but
held
nevertheless
that
the
exchange
was
not
liable
under
the
sherman
act
even
for
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
action.
but
the
government's
concern
is
with
the
legal
issue
and
we
are
not
concerned
as
the
parties
are
with
respect
to
the
particular
facts,
whether
the
district
court's
characterization
is
a
finding
that
remains
binding
or
whether
the
case
should
go
back
to
be
retried
under
a
correct
legal
theory
is
not
really
any
of
our
concern.
we
are
concerned
primarily
here
with
the
correct
rule
of
law.
we
think
that
both
courts
were
wrong
in
their
analysis
of
the
basic
legal
issues
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
sent
back
for
the
reasons
that
i'm
about
to
state.
our
analysis
of
the
critical
issues,
i
think,
i
can
state
most
clearly,
if
i
may
begin
by
stating
a
few
propositions
that
apparently
are
not
in
dispute
because
they
really
lay
the
necessary
groundwork
for
getting
to
the
more
difficult
questions.
and
i'll
state
them
rather
boldly
so
as
to
get
out
as
quickly
as
possible.
first,
the
stock
exchanges'
conduct
was
such
as
to
render
it
liable
to
the
plaintiff
under
the
sherman
act,
unless
the
securities
act
gives
it
some
kind
of
a
privilege
or
immunity.
that
follows
i
think,
from
the
fashion
originator's
guild
case
and
i
do
not
understand
it
to
be
disputed
in
this
court.
second,
the
securities
exchange
act
does
not
give
a
registered
stock
exchange,
its
members
or
related
nonmember
firms,
a
general
exemption
from
the
sherman
act.
there's
nothing
in
the
securities
exchange
act
which
makes
the
sherman
act
inapplicable
to
the
securities
market,
it's
either
in
new
york
or
elsewhere.
there's
nothing
that
authorizes
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
to
give
blanket
immunity.
and
of
course,
it
is
settled
most
reasonably
by
california
against
the
federal
power
commission
that
the
mere
enactment
of
a
regulatory
law
does
not
render
the
sherman
act
inapplicable
to
the
regulated
industry.
and
i
think
in
this
court
there's
really
no
question
about
that
proposition.
third,
the
securities
and
exchange
act
does
place,
we
say,
upon
registered
securities
and
exchange,
a
duty
of
industrial
self-regulation,
the
performance
of
which
is
affected
with
a
high
public
interest.
now
while
there
is
some
dispute
about
the
scope
of
the
duty
here,
i
think
that
everyone
agrees
that
section
6
of
the
securities
exchange
act
does
put
some
duty
upon
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
the
other
exchange.
the
theory
of
the
legislation
was
that
certain
minimum
statutory
rule
should
be
laid
down
that
the
exchanges
which
were
claiming
to
be
public
institutions
should
then
act
as
if
they
were
public
institutions
and
exert
their
special
position
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
carrying
the
initial
responsibility
for
allow
--
raising
above
strict
rules
of
law,
the
ethical
and
professional
level
of
those
carrying
on
the
securities'
transaction.
i
dwell
on
this
point
and
despite
the
fact
that
it
is
not
disputed
to
emphasize
the
great
importance
that
the
government
especially,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
attaches
to
the
exchanges'
initial
responsibility
for
the
duty
of
protecting
a
business.
no
adequate
substitute
is
really
available
for
the
commission
to
take
over
all
the
regulatory
and
quasi-regulatory
functions
of
the
stock
exchange
because
it
would
require
or
uncertainly
an
impracticable,
and
probably
undesirable
increase
of
personnel
and
revision
of
its
entire
method
of
operation.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
commission
essentially
supported
the
exchange
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
might
say
that
in
this
court,
i
think
it
is
proper
to
state
that
the
brief
that
is
filed
and
cited
by
myself
and
my
assistant,
mr.
friedman,
does
represent
a
composite
view
on
the
ground
that
it
was
up
to
the
government
to
formulate
a
position
and
as
often
happens
with
the
government
probably
one
of
the
number
of
agencies
might
have
stated
the
propositions
somewhat
differently,
they
might
have
answered
some
of
the
propositions
that
we
left
open
here
is
not
involved,
but
i
do
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
it
was
a
very
great
consensus
of
opinion,
and
that
this
is
a
composite
brief
for
the
entire
government
although
some
of
the
individual
people,
perhaps
including
myself
might
have
had
it
a
little
differently
if
they
stood
alone.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
the
commission
as
i
understand
it,
thinks
that
its
failure
to
set
aside
a
filed
rule
of
a
registered
security
and
exchange
under
section
19
or
under
section
6
gives
that
rule
a
special
status.
the
commission
does
not
say,
if
my
memory
is
correct,
that
it
has
in
this
case
approved
what
the
exchange
did
on
these
facts.
in
other
words,
i'm
going
to
argue
as
i
progress,
that
there
is
a
marked
difference
between
the
case
where
the
challenge
is
to
some
particular
rule
and
it
is
said
that
the
rule
was
improper
where
perhaps
the
exchanges
in
action
is
decisive,
and
the
court
may
not
go
behind
it.
and
the
case
where
the
essential
advice
is
in
the
way
the
exchange
apply
their
rule
to
the
particular
facts.
and
that's
the
case
that
we
think
that
we
have
here.
now,
nobody
says
that
the
exchange
could
have
reviewed
exactly
what
the
--
says
the
commission
could
have
reviewed
exactly
what
the
exchange
did
in
this
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
the
respondent
is
wrong
on
both
points.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
said
nobody
could
say
so,
nobody
could
sensibly
say
so.
i
think
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
the
commission
supposes
that
there
was
any
way
that
the
petitioner
could
have
gotten
relief
before
it
in
this
particular
case.
the
commission
does
think
and
i
think,
we
all
agree
that
there
are
ways
in
which
the
particular
rule
could
be
changed
as
to
the
future.
but
there's
no
way
that
mr.
silver's
company,
or
mr.
silver's
--
his
administrative
trading
can
get
any
compensation
from
the
new
york
stock
exchange
or
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
for
what
happened
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
come
now
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there's
no
--
there's
no
--
there's
machinery
for
challenging
the
general
rule.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
no
machinery
for
challenging
the
way
the
rule
is
applied
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
there's
certainly
no
machinery
for
giving
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
monetary
compensation.
i
come
now
to
one
of
the
propositions
that
is
disputed.
we
think
that
the
exchange's
duty
of
self-regulation
extends
to
the
scrutiny
of
closed
business
association
between
members
and
nonmembers,
including
direct
wire
connections.
this
is
disputed
of
course.
the
petitioner
argues
that
the
exchanges'
role
in
policing
securities
transaction
does
not
extend
to
transactions
or
the
exchange
of
information
between
members
and
nonmembers
concerning
over-the-counter
securities.
we
disagree
and
on
this
point,
we
stand
with
the
respondent
and
think
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
think
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
holding
that
the
exchange
has
no
responsibility
for
the
conduct
of
its
members
in
maintaining
wire
connections
with
people
of
dubious
financial
integrity
or
reliability.
the
district
court
said
that
the
exchanges'
functions
do
not
extend
beyond
transactions
in
listed
securities.
and
since
the
direct
wire
connections
were
used
preponderantly
in
--
transactions
in
unlisted
securities
that
that
was
not
on
the
exchanges'
business.
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
it
issued
the
injunction
against
cutting
off
these
direct
wire
connection.
so
far
as
they
pertain
to
the
exchange
of
information
or
transaction
without
unlisted
security.
the
words
of
the
statute
plainly
just
speak,
no
such
limitation
or
distinction
between
listed
and
unlisted
security
in
this
respect.
section
6
(b)
requires
an
exchange
to
have
rules
for
disciplining
a
member
for
conduct
to
our
proceeding
inconsistent
with
the
just
or
equitable
principles
of
trade.
there's
no
line
between
where
you
must
be
just
and
equitable
in
conducting
trade
and
where
you
may
cheat
in
conducting
trade.
and
under
section
6
(b),
the
exchanges'
rules
must
be
adequate
to
protect
the
investee,
not
just
investors
in
listed
securities
but
investors
of
all
counties.
surely,
we
submit
that
these
two
sections
of
the
statute
relating
to
the
rules
cover
investors
in
unlisted
security.
a
stock
exchange
member
who
cheats
his
customers
when
he's
dealing
in
unlisted
securities
and
they
do
deal
with
unlisted
security
but
is
scrupulously
honest
when
it
comes
to
dealing
with
listed
securities
surely
cannot
be
said
to
be
engaging
in
misconduct
consistent
with
the
just
and
equitable
principles
of
trades.
the
petitioners'
argument
in
this
court
is
a
little
different
as
i
understand
it.
he
says
that
while
the
exchange
has
a
responsibility
for
the
character
and
conduct
of
its
own
members,
it
has
no
responsibility
for
the
conduct
or
character
of
nonmembers
dealing
in
over-the-counter
markets.
well,
i'm
not
disposed
to
quarrel
with
that
proposition
as
a
generalization,
i
simply
submit
that
it
doesn't
answer
the
question
and
doesn't
resolve
the
issue
in
this
case.
but
we
think
that
the
maintenance
of
a
closed
and
continuous
business
relationship
builds
about
direct
wire
connection
is
part
of
the
members'
conduct
and
that
when
the
exchange
threatens
to
discipline
members
for
maintaining
wire
connections
with
a
dishonest
or
unreliable
dealer,
it
is
in
the
words
of
the
statute
disciplining
a
member
for
conduct,
his
conduct
inconsistent
with
just
and
equitable
principles
of
trades.
i
suggest
first
that
this
is
plainly
true
as
a
matter
of
analysis.
the
relationships
a
man
voluntarily
maintains
are
part
of
his
conduct.
and
if
he
maintains
relationships
that
bring
the
dishonest
or
unreliable
into
closer
touch
with
the
financial
community
where
they
can
rig
the
market
or
better
prey
upon
their
victims
then
he
is
acting
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
the
just
and
equitable
principles
of
trade.
petitioner
argued
precipitously
and
at
length
in
his
affidavits
and
papers
of
the
court
below
that
the
cutting
off
of
these
direct
wired
connections
seriously
injured
his
business
because
they're
so
important
to
one
dealing
in
over-the-counter
securities.
well,
i
submit
that
every
argument
that
can
be
made
to
demonstrate
their
importance
goes
to
demonstrate
the
responsibility
of
the
members
that
extend
those
connections
and
bring
the
unreliable
and
dishonest
further
into
the
financial
community
where
they
have
better
opportunities
to
engage
in
misconduct.
common
sense
i
think,
it
was
suggested
during
the
argument
of
mr.
shapiro
confirms
that
conclusion.
surely
it
can't
be
argued
seriously
that
the
exchange
has
no
legitimate
concern
with
whether
its
members
maintain
direct
wired
connections
with
swindlers,
professional
gamblers,
bucket
shops
or
others
who
lack
integrity
or
reliability
but
only
does
this
increase
the
unreliable
opportunity
to
do
wrong
but
of
course
some
of
the
disrepute
and
moral
responsibility
and
public
criticism
will
rub
off
on
those
who
maintain
such
relationships.
finally,
i
think
that
the
statute
itself
at
least
to
a
degree
in
one
specific
application
embraces
the
principle
that
a
member
should
refrain
from
affecting
transactions
having
relationships
with
unfit
person.
section
19
(a)
provides
that
the
commission
may
expel
a
member
from
the
exchange
if
the
member
has
affected
a
transaction
or
any
other
person
who
he
has
reason
to
believe
is
violating
any
provision
of
the
act.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
specific
application
of
where
the
statute
says
that
the
member
is
responsible
for
the
person
he
brings
into
the
community
and
enables
to
engage
in
an
improper
or
unlawful
transaction.
the
so-called
maloney
amendment,
15
--
section
15
(a),
as
the
statute
now
stands,
seems
to
us
to
contain
nothing
to
the
contrary.
the
amendment
put
the
primary
responsibility
for
over-the-counter
brokers
and
dealers
upon
the
national
association
of
securities
dealers.
and
there's
no
doubt
that
that
association
exercises
with
respect
to
nonmember
broker-dealers,
the
kind
of
initial
responsibility
and
general
requirement
of
oversight
that
the
registered
exchanges
exercised
with
respect
to
their
method.
but
the
worst
that
can
be
said
is
that
under
the
theory
of
the
court
below
and
our
theory,
there
exists
some
chance
of
duplication
in
the
degree
of
protection
accorded
to
investments.
i
submit
not
only
is
that
inherently
desirable,
certainly
not
undesirable
but
it's
not
sufficient
to
show
that
when
congress
enacted
the
maloney
amendment,
it
intended
to
take
away
from
the
registered
exchanges,
the
powers
that
they
previously
had
under
section
6.
i
turn
now
to
the
extent
of
privilege,
an
issue
on
which
the
government
is
more
nearly
aligned
with
the
petitioners,
the
plaintiff.
that
it
is
with
the
respondent
exchange.
and
again
i
start
with
what
seems
to
me
to
be
an
essentially
undisputed
proposition.
to
wit
that
the
exchange's
duty
of
self-regulation
carries
an
implied
privilege
or
immunity
from
liability.
at
least
where
its
action
is
in
truth
necessary
to
promote
observance
of
just
and
equitable
principles
of
trade,
and
does
not
unreasonably
restrain
competition.
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
difference
of
opinion
about
this,
either
among
the
two
courts
below
or
among
the
parties.
if
you
go
with
me
on
the
first
main
point
that
i've
argued
and
say
that
there
is
a
duty
to
cut
off
wire
connections
from
a
bucket
shop
or
a
non-swindler
or
someone
of
that
kind,
surely
if
there
is
the
duty
that
the
law
won't
turn
around
how
would
the
exchange
liable
under
the
fashion
originator's
guild
for
carrying
out
the
duty.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'd
--
i
thought
not.
if
he
does
--
i
don't
--
certainly
don't
want
to
mislead.
i
thought
there
was
no
argument
about
this
point.
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
whether
there
is
or
not,
it's
a
fairly
obvious
point.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
says
it
isn't
a
duty.
oh
well,
it's
a
dispute
on
whether
it's
a
duty.
really,
all
the
point
i
am
actually
saying
is,
if
the
exchange
is
doing
what
one
act
requires
it
to
do,
you
can't
hold
it
liable
and
punish
it
under
the
other
act
for
doing
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
doesn't
come
down
to
anything
more
than
that.
it's
just
really
the
threshold
for
my
next
point
which
is
hotly
debated.
although,
there
we
agree
with
the
petitioner.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
meant
very
literally,
in
truth
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i'll
come
to
that
next.
i
really
meant
literally
in
fact
and
in
truth.
now,
i
come,
as
your
honor
suggest,
to
the
far
more
important
and
more
difficult
question,
what
happens
when
the
exchange
supposes
that
it
is
promoting
just
and
equitable
principles
of
trade
but
actually
in
truth,
it
is
wrong.
and
i
want
here
to
suggest
one
very
important
distinction
which
comes
back
to
a
point
that
i
was
discussing
earlier
with
mr.
justice
stewart.
we
think
the
two
kinds
of
cases,
as
well
as
another
distinction
between
the
kinds
of
mistakes
but
now
i'm
talking
about
the
kinds
of
reason
the
--
kinds
of
challenge
to
the
exchanges'
action.
what
the
challenge
may
be
to
the
exchanges'
rule,
let
me
give
two
illustrations.
suppose
that
the
exchange
were
to
adopt
a
rule
that
no
direct
wire
service
may
be
extended
to
any
graduate,
to
very
recognized
to
it,
anyone
who
has
graduated
from
a
recognized
law
school
or
anyone
who
has
been
admitted
to
the
bar
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
such
a
rule,
i
take
it,
would
have
no
tendency
to
promote
just
and
equitable
principles
of
trade.
take
another
possibility.
suppose
that
the
exchange
adopted
a
rule
that
no
member
shall
extend
wire
service
to
any
broker-dealer
who
deals
in
listed
securities
of
the
big
board,
over-the-counter,
such
a
rule
it
can
be
argued
would
tend
to
promote
just
and
equitable
principles
of
trade.
it
can
also
be
answered
that
such
a
rule
is
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade.
in
such
a
case,
it
would
seem
to
us,
this
doesn't
have
to
be
decided
but
it
would
seem
to
us
that
someone
must
make
the
determination
other
than
the
exchange
itself.
and
the
question
becomes
whether
that
determination
is
made
in
binding
fashion
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
when
it
registers
the
exchange,
it
takes
no
action
to
require
a
change
in
its
rules,
or
perhaps
it
is
open
for
litigation
in
any
case
in
the
district
court.
we've
discussed
the
pros
and
cons
because
this
is
the
first
case
involving
this
kind
of
problem.
it
is
an
issue
on
which
the
government
has
taken
no
position,
because
we
don't
think
the
question
is
presented
here.
now,
why
isn't
it
presented
here?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
perhaps,
justice
stewart,
i'd
rather
leave
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
commission
undoubtedly
has
power
to
require
a
change
in
the
rule.
on
the
other
hand,
i
have
grave
doubt
when
the
commission
registered
the
new
york
stock
exchange
whether
it's
scrutinized
every
rule
in
this
book
--
mr.
archibald
cox
---
and
dealt
with
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
has
power
to
change
rules
in
certain
specific
categories.
whether
it
has
power
to
change
every
rule,
i'm
not
sure.
but
again,
my
reply
isn't
here
--
isn't
the
merits
of
this
question
because
we
think
that
this
question
doesn't
have
to
be
decided
here.
here,
the
real
basis
as
we
see
it
in
the
exchanges'
conduct
was
not
the
rule
concerning
the
maintenance
of
direct
wire
connections,
but
rather
the
manner
in
which
the
exchange
attempted
to
apply
the
harmless
rule
in
this
particular
case.
and
this
we
think
involves
a
quite
different
question
from
the
validity
of
the
rule.
the
sec,
i
say
again,
by
the
wildest
stretch
of
the
imagination
cannot
be
supposed
to
review
than
to
prove
the
exchanges'
conduct
in
this
particular
instance.
and
there's
no
way
in
which
the
sec
can
fully
remedy
the
wrong
if
there
was
in
fact
a
wrong.
now
counsel
for
the
exchange
say
that
the
commission
must
have
approved
the
exchanges'
conduct
because
they
didn't
require
the
exchange
to
change
the
rule,
but
i
submit,
perhaps
i
stated
it
over,
overly
broadly
before,
i
submit
they
can't
really
mean
that.
they
can't
make
that
the
commission,
by
its
silence,
simply
by
its
failure
to
change
the
rule,
intended
to
give
the
exchange
a
license
to
cut
off
wire
connection
for
any
reason,
however
arbitrary,
whimsical,
or
malicious.
suppose
for
example,
that
the
exchange
should
decide
to
honor
its
board
of
governors
by
giving
each
--
by
putting
all
the
names
of
the
nonmembers
having
direct
wire
connection
into
a
hat.
and
then
the
board
of
governors
would
be
honored
because
each
member
on
his
birthday
could
pull
a
name
out
of
the
hat
and
that
member's
wire
connections
would
then
be
terminated.
surely,
when
the
exchange
approved
--
failed
to
object
to
this
rule,
it
didn't
approve
that
kind
of
conduct.
mr.
archibald
cox
even
--
i
suppose
that
the
exchange
did
know
the
general
character
of
the
investigations
that
were
being
carried
on,
even
if
you
make
the
assumption
that
that
was
approved.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
exchanges'
action
would
still
remain
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
in
this
case,
because
quite
apart
from
the
procedure
followed,
the
character
of
the
investigation,
the
inferences
it
drew
from
the
facts
before
it
in
this
instance
were
unreasonable.
what
it
had
was
really
not
enough
evidence
for
a
reasonable
man
to
conclude
that
these
people
were
not
of
sufficient
integrity.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
what
i
would
call
a
standard
of
conduct
that
you
shan't
have
wire
connections
with
those
who
lack
integrity
in
financial
reliability.
or
has
been,
i
assume,
it
has
been
impliedly
approved
by
the
commission
if
it
can
approve
finally
that
sort
of
thing,
and
i
assume
that
that
is
what
the
exchange
was
doing
here.
although,
remember
that
so
far
as
the
record
goes,
they
didn't
really
tell
anybody
what
they
were
doing
here.
now,
in
these
cases
where
there
is
a
mistake
in
the
way
the
proper
and
standard
of
conduct
is
being
applied,
then
we
think
the
exchange
should
have
only
a
limited
privilege.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no,
no
on
the
contrary.
i
assume
we
start
with
the
existing
law
and
that
the
question
is
what
privilege
with
the
causes
of
action
remaining
the
same,
perhaps
i
should
begin
on
this
in
the
morning.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
either
way,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'll
finish
--
i'll
finish
now
then.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
it's
--
my
difference
with
--
to
come
directly
to,
i
guess
the
point
your
honor
has
in
mind,
my
difficulty
with
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
somewhat
the
one
that
justice
stewart
mentioned
earlier.
if
in
order
to
encourage
the
exchange
to
perform
these
very
important
obligations,
it
is
desirable
to
give
them
a
privilege
when
they're
acting
in
performance
of
those
obligations,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
this
extends
to
one
form
of
liability
just
as
much
as
to
another.
i
see
no
reason
why
it
should
be
confined
to
the
sherman
act.
now,
we
think
the
privilege
should
be
limited
to
a
qualified
privilege.
in
other
words,
when
they
are
acting
reasonably
in
the
character
of
the
investigations
and
draw
reasonable
inferences
from
the
facts
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
just
like
the
police
officer
who
in
complete
good
faith
used
his
force
to
prevent
what
he
thinks
is
a
felony,
and
later
the
jury
finds
that
he
used
more
force
than
was
reasonably
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
they
reached
reasonable
conclusion.
mr.
archibald
cox
even
though
it
might
have
been
wrong.
but
if
they
are
arbitrary
or
unreasonable
in
their
action
then
there
should
be
liability.
now,
to
answer
your
questions
a
little
more
precisely
because
there
is
a
point
here,
judge
hayes
in
the
court
below
apparently
said,
“we
read
the
securities
exchange
act
as
giving
an
absolute
immunity
from
all
liability
at
least
under
the
sherman
act.
and
that
it
seems
to
me
if
it's
an
immunity
from
liability
under
the
sherman
act,
got
to
be
equally
by
a
parity
of
reasoning,
and
immunity
from
liability
for
conspiracy.
not
under
the
sherman
act,
common
law
conspiracy.”
then
he
was
obviously
troubled
by
that
conclusion,
so
he
said,
“well,
now
we've
got
to
create
a
new
statutory
cause
of
action.”
this
is
what
he
suggested
but
did
not
pass
it.
now,
we've
got
to
create
a
new
statutory
cause
of
action
to
take
care
of
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
conduct.
i
think
that's
an
extraordinary
artifact.
what
the
law
normally
does
is
to
start
with
its
rules
and
with
the
sherman
act,
there
was
rules
of
tort
or
whatever
thereof.
and
then
when
it
wants
to
encourage
certain
conduct
in
the
public
interest
and
gives
a
privilege,
it
carves
an
exception
out.
if
you
fail
to
bring
yourself
within
the
privilege
or
the
exception
then
you're
liable
under
the
existing
law.
if
you
bring
yourself
within
it,
you
are
not.
we've
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
reasons
for
recognizing
only
a
qualified
privilege
and
i
think
the
case
shall
be
remanded.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
we
would
reverse
holding
that
the
privilege
of
the
exchange
is
a
privilege
limited
to
protect
it
while
it
makes
reasonable
mistakes
that
here,
there
was
a
characterization
by
the
district
court
that
it
acted
arbitrarily
and
unreasonably
that
having
reasoned
that
far,
the
case
should
then
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
whether
to
hold
that
the
finding
of
the
district
court
was
conclusive
or
to
say
that
the
case
should
be
reheard
on
a
proper
theory
of
law
in
the
district
court.
i
don't
think
this
court
needs
to
face
that
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
--
i
think
not,
your
honor.
first,
i
think
that
this
cannot
be
made
into
a
case
of
malice.
there's
no
question
that
they
acted
in
good
faith.
mr.
archibald
cox
legal
malice,
intentional
interference
with
contract.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
say
that
the
case
that
they
have
two
causes
of
action
here,
really.
one
would
be
the
cause
of
action
your
honor
mentioned,
the
other
would
be
the
cause
of
action
under
the
sherman
act
which
does
cover
cases
of
malicious
interference
with
the
contract
where
it
is
by
a
conspiracy
in
restraint
with
interstate
trade.
i
think
they're
both
causes
of
action.
in
each
case,
i
think
their
privilege
is
a
limited
one
and
since
they
acted
arbitrarily
and
unreasonably
as
this
court
i
think
mistaken
here,
that
in
neither
each
case
is
the
privilege
adequate
effect.
