justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
maybe
i'm
wrong.
i
thought
that
the
stock
exchange
rules
required
the
applications
for
wire
services
of
this
kind,
with
respect
to
the
nonmember
to
be
made
by
the
member?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
say
that
this
application
was
made
by
your
client?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
any
cause
of
action
alleged
here
beyond
the
treble
damage
action?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
under
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
the
action
is
still
pending
at
least
insofar
as
the
--
was
not
brought
under
the
antitrust
law,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
that
(inaudible)
for
practical
purpose,
does
it
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
fact,
this
case
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
think
this
private
individual
for
the
private
treble
damage
in
my
recollection
could
get
injunction
under
the
treble
damage
laws.
justice
john
m.
harlan
maybe
this
was
sort
of
an
inherent
power
of
authority.
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
this
means
i
take
it
is
that
this
power
of
authority
really
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you're
not
contesting
the
power
of
authority.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
that
at?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
says
or
at
least
the
record
say
that
the
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
to
put
that
in
concrete
case,
if
i
--
if
you
were
--
supposing
you
could
(inaudible)
under
the
guise
of
exercising
your
powers,
you
have
what
you
say,
bad
faith
and
predatory
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
no,
no,
no.
therefore,
you
don't
go
as
far
to
court
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
saying
is
(inaudible)
in
the
absence
of
a
demonstrated
purpose
(inaudible)
authority
to
assert
antitrust
(voice
overlap)
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
were
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
you're
right
on
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
the
exchange
contravene
the
rule
saying
all
the
members
shall
have
wires
--
extended
wire
service
except
for
the
nonmembers
so
that
it
would
be
held
with
wire
services
to
the
nonmembers?
