justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
suggested
that
the
court
investigate
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
then
that
--
completely
decides
the
point
what
the
district
court
found
to
the
--
as
to
the
conduct
of
msc
or
of
its
officers,
that
even
if
--
even
in
the
case
of,
say,
known
dishonesty
or
proved
dishonesty
that
there
would
be
no
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
that
some
--
there
is
a
--
no
joint
action
against
a
known
crook
for
example,
would
be
immunized.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
they
could
draw
completely
unreasonable
and
irrational
inferences
form
the
fact
that
those
would
still
be
in
good
faith.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
--
do
you
--
in
that
case
however,
you
would
still
exclude
them
to
treble
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
aren't
you
really
--
are
you
covering
both
injunctive
relief
and
damages
to
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
said
he
couldn't
be
sued
just
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
he
makes
a
mistake,
his
mistake
could
be
corrected.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
also
--
even
though
you're
--
even
--
you
say
that
anything
within
the
scope
of
your
duty,
you
must
be
free
to
perform.
you
are
going
to
say
why
this
was
in
the
scope
of
your
duty.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
the
problem
of
the
--
with
giving
any
standard
that
the
duty
of
operating
as
hazard?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
you
said
a
while
ago.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
like
what
you
said
briefly
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
you
can
go
on
to
say
and
you'll
probably
get
to
this
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
if
you
are
immune
to
antitrust
laws
where
--
within
these
areas
that
people
are
trapped
are
also
immune
to
damages
under
any
circumstances?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
anything
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
anything
you
do
within
the
scope
of
your
(voice
overlap)
doing
good
faith,
there's
no
liability
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
really
just
isn't
a
question
of
whether
congress
intended
to
exempt
some
(inaudible)
any
damages
at
all
because
they
told
them
to
do
something.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
matter
how
--
no
matter
how
you
do
something,
whether
it's
good
faith
or
bad
faith,
or
reasonable
or
not,
there
could
be
something
hope
you
did
in
good
faith
is
--
but
if
you
made
a
mistake
about
the
scope
of
your
duty
was,
you
wouldn't
be
exempt
from
the
standards,
i
suppose.
there's
got
to
be
some
standard
in
determining
what
is
within
the
scope
of
this
responsibility
of
congress
or
suppose
there's
something
which
appears
as
an
exchange,
it
might
be
outside
the
scope
of
your
responsibility.
justice
byron
r.
white
assuming
it's
outside
the
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
no
one
incurs
that
it
should
be
a
trial
in
the
antitrust
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
you
assert
that
everybody
believed
that
this
is
a
per
se
violation
except
for
the
exemption
of
plain
defense?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
--
then
you're
saying
that
the
exchange
shouldn't
second
guess
the
nasd
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
â€“
it's
the
nasd
which
has
also
got
the
job
of
disciplining
over-the-counter
dealers
--
justice
byron
r.
white
aren't
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we
still
have
a
minor
question
on
the
side
to
whether
the
exchange
does
or
doesn't
have
to
have
the
same
standards
for
its
members
in
dealing
with
nonmembers
of
the
nasd
or
the
sec.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
is
considerably
broader
than
i
understood
you
awhile
ago.
let's
assume
that
the
--
let's
assume
that
someone
--
that
some
former
dealer
had
his
license
revoked
and
broker-dealer
had
his
license
revoked
but
he
goes
on
dealing.
now,
can
--
can
we
say
then
i
suppose
that
the
exchange
cannot
be
this
cumbersome.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
this
member
is
supposed
to
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you'll
notice
he
just
goes
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
let's
assume
that
--
you
would
say
then
that
the
broker-dealer
who
has
had
suspension
put
on
him
three
times
in
a
row
within
a
year
for
a
temporary
period
that
even
then
the
stock
exchange
did
not
keep
its
member
from
dealing
with
that
person?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
then
saying
that
the
exchange
hasn't
got
power
to
order
him
to
quit
--
to
cut
off
the
wire?
hasn't
that
the
--
hasn't
that
the
exchange
--
the
exchange
hasn't
got
the
power
to
waive
his
fellow
than
cease
doing
business
with
this
--
