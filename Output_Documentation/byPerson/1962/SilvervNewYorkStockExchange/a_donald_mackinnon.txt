mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
of
my
argument,
i
wish
to
state
that
the
stock
exchange
does
not
take
the
position
that
it
can
act
maliciously
with
predatory
motives
or
in
bad
faith.
such
is
not
and
never
has
been
our
contention.
we
say
that
we
must
act
in
good
faith
and
that
we
did
so
act
and
that
is
the
standard
by
which
we
shall
be
judged.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
state
what
a
stock
exchange
is,
what
it
does,
and
what
it
is
required
to
do.
the
stock
exchange
is
an
unincorporated
association
in
new
york.
it
has
1,375
members.
it
is
and
always
has
been
regulated
by
the
membership,
by
the
stock
exchange
with
the
enactment
of
the
1934
act.
there
was
a
decided
strengthening
of
that
regulation.
now,
the
exchange
is
required
to
police
and
discipline
its
members.
that
duty
is
imposed
upon
it
by
congress.
the
stock
exchange
is
jealous
of
the
financial
standing
and
repute
of
its
members.
it
is
jealous
of
protecting
that
which
it
is
required
to
protect
the
rep
--
its
take
--
its
reputation
and
standing
for
the
protection
of
investors
and
to
ensure
equitable
and
just
principles
of
trade
which
congress
has
imposed
upon
it.
now,
it
has
a
high
degree
of
accountability
and
it
endeavors
and
always
has
endeavored
to
maintain
that
degree
of
accountability.
very
obviously,
no
rules
and
regulations
of
the
exchange
would
be
enforced
or
could
be
enforceable
if
1,375
members
were
to
go
their
various
ways
and
say
that
they
would
do
as
they
please.
because
of
that
fact,
it
is
the
exchange
that
has
the
duty
to
see
that
its
members
enforce
its
rules
and
regulations.
and
in
doing
so,
obviously,
there
are
restraints
imposed
upon
the
freedom
of
action
of
members.
now,
we
furnish
an
auction
market
for
1,100
odd
listings
of
securities.
when
our
members
deal
with
one
another
as
they
are
required
to
do
when
a
member
comes
in
and
offers
a
security
for
sale
and
another
member
buys
a
security,
they
must
deal
with
one
another.
they
must
of
necessity
and
we
as
an
exchange
must
of
necessity
be
interested
in
their
financial
responsibility
and
in
their
integrity,
so
that
when
and
as
our
members,
as
they
did
in
this
particular
case,
have
private
wires,
we
were
and
has
the
duty
of
being
interested
in
the
person
who
had
the
wire
connection
with
the
member
firm.
now,
i
should
like
at
this
point
to
deal
very
briefly
with
the
1934
act.
and
in
doing
so,
i
would
like
to
refer
very
briefly
to
a
portion
of
section
2,
which
is
entitled
necessity
for
regulation
as
provided
in
this
title.
and
to
emphasize
for
your
honors
that
what
was
designed
was
the
regulation
of
securities
transactions
as
commonly
conducted
on
securities
exchanges
and
over-the-counter
markets
stating
that
they
were
affected
with
a
national
public
interest
which
makes
it
necessary
to
provide
for
the
regulation
and
control
of
such
transactions,
and
of
practices.
and
i
underscore
the
words,
“of
practices”,
and
matters
related
thereto.
and
further,
and
to
impose
requirements
necessary
to
make
such
regulation
and
control
reasonably,
complete,
and
effective.
now,
that
is
what
congress
said
and
then
they
provided
for
the
registration
of
national
securities
exchanges.
and
we
are
a
registered
national
security
exchange.
and
under
section
6
of
the
cert
--
1934
act,
we
were
required
by
congress
to
meet
certain
terms
and
conditions.
and
to
file
a
registration
statement
which
provided
that
we
would
agree
to
comply
and,
and
again
i
emphasize,
to
enforce
so
far
as
within
its
powers
compliance
by
its
members
with
the
provisions
of
the
1934
act
and
any
amendment
thereto,
and
any
rule
or
regulation
made
or
to
be
made
thereunder.
we
were
then
required
to
file
data
with
respect
to
our
organization,
rules
of
procedure,
membership,
etcetera,
and
further,
copies
of
our
constitution,
articles
and
incorporation,
and
all
amendment,
and
of
its
existing
bylaws
or
rules,
or
instruments
corresponding
thereto,
whatever
the
name,
which
were
collectively
referred
to
as
rules
of
the
exchange.
we
also
hand
to
agree
to
furnish
the
commission
with
any
amendments
for
changes
in
our
rules,
forthwith
upon
adoption.
now,
section
6
(b)
provides
that
no
exchange
shall
be
granted
registration
for
that
the
registration
shall
remain
enforced
unless
the
rules
of
the
exchange
include
provision
for
the
expulsion,
suspension
for
disciplining
of
a
member.
now,
obviously,
no
exchange
could
operate
on
the
basis
of
one
rule.
so
the
act
then
provides
that
nothing
in
the
title
shall
be
construed
to
prevent
any
exchange
from
adopting
and
enforcing
any
rule
not
inconsistent
with
the
act,
and
the
rules
and
regulations
thereunder,
and
the
applicable
laws
of
the
state
in
which
the
exchange
is
located.
then
we
come
to,
what
in
my
opinion,
is
an
exceedingly
important
part
of
the
act
dealing
with
registration
and
that
is
that
it
must
appear
because
now
we
have
the
duty
imposed
upon
the
commission.
it
states,
if
it
appears
to
the
commission
that
the
exchange
applying
for
registration
is
so
organized
as
to
be
able
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
this
title
and
the
rules
and
regulations
thereunder,
and
the
rules
of,
and
that
the
rules
of
the
exchange
are
just
and
adequate
to
ensure
fair
dealing,
and
to
protect
investors,
the
commission
shall
pose
such
exchange
to
be
registered
as
a
national
securities
exchange.
in
other
words,
there
is
an
affirmative
duty
cast
upon
the
commission
to
determine
that
the
exchange
is
so
setup,
that
it
can
enforce
its
rules,
and
that
its
rules
are
designed
to
protect
investors.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
--
in
fact
--
i
don't
put
ourselves
in
the
category
of
the
government
agency.
i
certainly
say
we
have
quasi-government
duties
and
i
would
say
that
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
i
know
of
no
other
body
that
has
the
same
duties
of
self-regulation
as
the
exchanges.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
oh,
yes.
i
don't
raise
that
question
at
all.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
that
is
correct.
i
don't
--
i
raise
no
dispute
with
the
statement.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
that
is
correct.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
there
isn't
any
doubt
on
my
mind
on
that.
i
raise
no
point
on
that
at
all.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
somewhat
similar
but
i
think
we
go
much
further
in
regulation
under
this
act.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
think
that
we
--
let's
put
it
this
way,
we
have
a
duty
and
that's
the
thing
that
i
want
to
emphasize,
duty.
and
obviously,
to
perform
that
duty,
we
must
have
the
power.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i'd
say,
your
honor
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
if
we
make
a
mistake
that
we
have
not
fallen
in
violation
of
the
act
as
long
as
we
have
proceeded
in
good
faith.
because
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
that
congress
would
have
said
to
the
exchange,
as
it
has
said
in
this
act
that
you
are
acting
at
your
peril
every
time
that
you
act,
and
in
effect
to
be
an
insurer
of
your
conduct.
i
don't
think
that
any
organization
could
possibly
undertake
the
responsibilities
imposed
upon
them
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
think
we
are.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
think
we
are
and
i
think
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
don't
believe
that
a
government
official
would
be
held
liable
at
all
unless
he
had
acted
with
malice
aforethought,
and
incomplete
disregard
of
his
responsibilities.
i
don't
think
that
he
could
be
held
liable
for
performing
his
duties
as
long
as
he
performs
them
within
the
scope
of
his
responsibilities
and
in
good
faith.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
don't
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
don't
think
he
could.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
doubt
very
much
whether
he
could
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
but
i
don't
say
that
we
are
entitled.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i'm
going
to,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
well,
i
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
oh,
that's
right.
i'm
not
taking
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
injunctive
relief,
i
say
to
your
honors,
in
this
case
and
i'm
going
to
come
to
that.
they
could
have
had
injunctive
relief,
have
they
proceeded
in
the
manner
that
they
should
have
proceeded.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
yes,
i
am.
i
am.
and
i'm
going
to,
if
i
may
at
this
point,
if
i
may
answer
your
honor's
question
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
--
i
would
like
to
proceed
to
the
next
point.
i
would
like
to
just
point
out
to
your
honors,
and
i
think
it's
exceedingly
important
at
this
point
to
refer
to
the
rule
under
which
the
exchange
acted.
the
constitution
provides
that
its
board
of
governors
must
approve
these
words
and
we
--
that
constitution
was
filed.
as
mr.
justice
harlan
inquired
yesterday
the
origin
of
these
wires
comes,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
stated,
at
the
request
of
a
member
and
after
the
member
requested
then
and
then
only
does
the
applicant
filed
his
application
and
it
is
given
a
temporary
approval
pending
an
investigation.
but
let
me
turn
to
the
specific
rules.
rule
355,
and
i'm
reading
from
the
record
and
i'm
only
going
to
read
briefly
at
page
196,
“no
member
or
member
organization
shall
establish
or
maintain
any
wire
connection,
private
radio,
television
or
wireless
system
between
his
or
its
offices
and
the
office
of
any
nonmember,
or
permit
any
private
radio
or
television
system
between
his
or
its
offices
without
prior
consent
of
the
exchange.”
and
356,
“the
exchange
may
require
at
any
time
the
discontinuance
of
any
means
of
communication
whatsoever
which
has
a
terminus
in
the
office
a
member
or
a
member
organization.”
now,
let
me
state
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
197,
your
honor,
of
the
record.
let
me
state
that
these
specific
rules
were
filed
with
the
exchange
and
these
specific
rules
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
--
with
the
commission.
and
these
specific
rules
were
approved
as
they
were
required
to
be
approved
under
section
6
(d)
before
we
were
accorded
registration.
further
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
would
say
many
do.
i
would
say
there
are
roughly
over
2,000
people
that
have
wires
who
are
nonmembers.
and
we
give
our
wires
to
anybody
that
will
meet
our
standards
of
integrity.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
think
it
can
be
running
but
there
is
roughly
as
shown
by
this
record,
approximately
3,600
over-the-counter
dealers
that
do
not
have
private
wires.
i
--
if
you're
asking
my
personal
opinion,
i
think
it
is
a
pri
--
a
--
a
priced
instrument.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
there
is
no
question
about
that.
that
is,
that
is
utilized.
that
is
utilized.
and
also
in
that
connection,
your
honor,
let
me
state
that
they
state
that
it
was
a
very
valuable
asset
in
this
case.
but
the
question
of
damages,
despite
the
fact
you
wanted
to
bring
it
up
at
this
time,
was
denied
by
a
split
court.
so
we're
only
here
on
the
question
of
injunctive
relief.
now,
let's
see
what
happened
here.
we
were
granted
registration
under
date
of
september
28
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
the
injunction.
we're,
we're
not
reviewing
the
--
that's
the
only
thing
that
is
here
before
your
honors
on
certiorari.
the
court
of
appeals
split
three-to-three
on
the
question
of
damages.
we
wanted
to
bring
everything
up
at
one
time
and
only
with
respect
for
our
private
lawyers.
have
i
answered
your
honor's
question?
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
well,
on
the
question
of
--
they
applied
for
an
en
banc
was
denied
and
they
split
it
three-three
on
the
question
of
damages
(inaudible)
he
would
not
let
us
take
it
up.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
oh,
it
is.
that's
the
basis
on
which
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
oh,
no.
they
applied
for
damages
as
well
but
we
were
not
permitted
to
bring
up
for
review,
this
question
of
damages
and
the
trial
court
this
case
as
all
cases
for
motion
--
on
motions
for
summary
judgment
has
a
paper
record.
the
district
court
has
the
same
record
that
your
honors
have
before
you.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
the
question?
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
oh,
yes.
that
is
definitely
the
question
and
the
injunction
was
granted
under
the
sherman
act.
but
the
question
of
the
damage
and
the
amount
upon
the
damages
is
a
question
that
preserves.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
what's
that?
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
not
under
the
--
not
under
the
sherman
act.
i
haven't
gotten
to
that
point.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
said
it
couldn't.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
oh,
in
my
mind
--
in
my
opinion,
there
is
no
question
about
it.
judge
hays
so
held
and
i
don't
think
there's
remotest
doubt
about
it.
but
i
want,
i
want
to
come
to
that
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
they've
gotten
it
under
the
sherman
act.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
would
say,
yes,
they
had
a
right
to
issue
it
under
the
proper
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
how
could
they
--
well,
they
applied
for
an
injunction
under
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
they
got
it.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
section
4
and
16.
that's
the
other
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
no,
i
don't
think
--
i
think
you
are
wrong
that
they
can
have
injunctive
relief
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
what's
that?
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
no,
they
didn't.
no,
this
would
not
be
exercise
of
power
of
authority.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
416,
they
asked
for
damages
and
injunctive
relief
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
now,
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
it
provides
--
section
16
of
the
clayton
act,
any
person,
firm,
corporation
or
association
shall
be
entitle
to
sue
and
have
the
injunctive
the
relief
against
threatened
loss
or
damage
by
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
when
and
under
the
same
conditions
and
principles
as
injunctive
relief
against
threatened
conduct
that
will
cause
loss
or
damage
is
granted
by
courts
of
equity.
but
they
granted
it
under
the
sherman
act
under
the
rules
governing
such
proceedings
that
upon
a
showing
of
a
danger
of
irreparable
loss
or
damage
is
immediate,
a
preliminary
injunction
may
issue.--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
from
section
16
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
that's
appendix
a,
brief
of
the
petitioners
at
page
33,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
oh,
i
think
it
does.
i
think
it
answers
mr.
justice
harlan's
question.
did
your
honor
have
a
question?
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
as
against
the
private
person.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
do.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
well,
i
don't
think
that
it
was
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
say
under
the
equitable
powers
of
the
court,
the
court
have
inherent
equitable
powers
to
grant
a
--
an
injunction
in
any
case.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
yes.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
no,
i
don't
--
well
that
that
may
be
a
correct
interpretation.
that
is
not
the
interpretation
that
i
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
yes,
i
will.
any
person,
firm,
corporation
or
association
shall
be
entitled
to
sue
for
and
have
injunctive
relief
against
threatened
loss
or
damage
by
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
when
and
under
the
same
conditions
and
principles
as
injunctive
relief
against
threatened
conduct
will
cause
loss
or
damage
is
granted
by
courts
of
equity
under
the
same
conditions.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
oh,
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
it's
true
but
it
is
under
the
sherman
act
if
they
got
it.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
oh,
no.
no,
i'm
not.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
at
this
point,
i've
read
to
you
our
rule.
i
told
you
that
we
were
registered
on
september
28,
1934.
and
in
the
annual
report
that
was
filed
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
30,
1935,
the
commission
stated
in
considering
these
applications,
the
applications
for
registration,
the
constitution
bylaws
and
rules
and
regulations
of
each
exchange
were
examined
and
analyzed.
now
obviously
when
we
state
in
our
rules
that
were
on
file
that
we
will
have
the
right
to
approve
member
firm
wires
with
nonmembers
and
to
discontinue
member
firm
wires
with
nonmembers
that
is
a
specific
rule
that
was
approved
by
the
commission
under
its
responsibilities
under
section
6
(d)
before
they
registered.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
a
provision
that
if
we
fail
to
enforce
the
rule,
enforce
the
act
and
enforce
the
rules
that
we,
under
section
19
(a)
can
have
our
registration
suspended.
we
can
have
it
suspended
for
a
period
of
12
months
or
even
withdrawn.
the
law
and
the
bear
case,
bear
versus
franklin
has
said
and
it
seems
to
me
self-evident
that
the
exchange
not
only
has
the
duty
to
enact
rules
and
regulations
but
to
enforce.
now,
that
being
the
case,
here,
you
are
dealing
with
a
rule
or
rules
that
were
filed
with
the
sec
that
the
sec
affirmatively
found
in
approving
registration
that
the
rule
was
just
and
adequate
to
ensure
fair
dealing.
and
you
will
recall
that
the
solicitor
general
and
the
same
was
true
of
the
district
court
petitioner,
they
did
nothing
that
the
commission
had
scrutinized
the
rules
with
any
care
and
that
as
far
as
these
rules
were
concerned,
it
was
more
or
less
lip
service.
but
the
act,
the
order
of
approval
and
the
annual
report
shows
that
they
did
in
fact
analy
--
examine
and
analyze
these
rules
as
they
were
required
to
do
before
they
accorded
this
registration.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
it's
on
page
95,
a
quote
from
it,
page
95
of
the
record.
and
i
read
the
--
only
a
portion
thereof.
now,
in
addition
to
--
i
have
to
speed
here.
in
addition
to
19
(a),
there
is
a
19
(b)
provision,
and
the
19
(b)
provision
provides
that
the
commission
can,
if
it
is
supposed
to
do
so,
tell
us
to
change
our
rules.
and
if
we
do
not
do
so,
that
they
can
order
a
hearing
and
after
the
hearing
promulgate
a
rule.
in
addition
thereto
under
section
23
(a),
the
commission
can't
issue
rules
of
its
own.
and
these
rules
and
regulations
are
subject
to
review
by
a
person
agreed
under
section
25
of
the
act.
now,
and
i
want
to
go
a
step
further
than
this
because
it
is
my
position
that
there
can
be
no
question
but
what
anybody
reading
the
congressional
and
senate
reports
that
this
--
the
dickinson
report
at
the
time
of
the
organization,
the
sec
knows
that
the
responsibilities
were
imposed
upon
the
exchange
to
enact
and
to
enforce
its
rules.
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
that
as
far
as
the
petitioners
here
are
concerned,
if
they
were
disposed
to
do
so
that
they
could
have
brought
immediately
into
the
commission
and
said,
we
are
a
person
aggrieved,
and
as
a
person
aggrieved,
we
tell
you
that
we
want
action
with
respect
to
this
rule,
under
which
the
private
wire
between
members
and
ourselves
were
discontinued.
and
they
could
do
that
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
government,
the
solicitor
general
failed
to
state
so
that
is
the
position
that
he
took
in
his
brief
at
page
17
where
he
said,
“well,
neither
the
securities
exchange
act
nor
the
commission
rules
of
practice,
specifically
authorized
the
filing
of
a
complaint
with
the
agency
by
a
person
adversely
affected
by
a
rule
of
an
exchange,
the
commission
would
ordinarily
entertain
such
a
complaint,
if
it
made
substantial
allegations.”
and
here,
they
chose
another
course.
they
chose
to
saddle
us
or
attempt
to
saddle
us
with
a
liability
which
would
be
treble
to
with,
in
this
particular
case,
if
and
we
are
charged
with
the
--
with
the
duty
of
enforcing
a
rule
if
we
enforce
them
through
mistake
of
judgment,
not
now
saying
good
faith
because
i
say,
good
faith
is
a
standard
that
your
honors
must
apply.
but
we
face,
according
to
petitioners
contention
with
a
liability
of
$3
million
and
also
potentially
criminal
liabilities
as
well.
i
say
that
congress
at
no
time
could
possibly
have
ever
conceived
a
remedy
such
as
that.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
would
say
definitely
so,
your
honor,
unless
you
find
that
we
proceeded
in
good
faith
and
good
faith
is
a
standard.
and
good
faith
in
my
opinion
means
that
we
were
attempting
to
perform
the
responsibilities
cast
upon
us
by
statute
in
a
fair,
proper,
and
in
my
opinion,
whether
it'd
be
a
mistake
of
judgment
or
not,
certainly,
there
can
be
no
liability
but
if
we
were
motivated
by
malice,
there
could
no
immunity.
if
we
were
motivated
with
a
predatory
objective,
there
could
be
no,
no
possible
immunity
and
if
we
acted
in
bad
faith.
but
as
long
as
we
acted,
misguided
if
it
be
but
nevertheless
acted
in
good
faith,
i
say
that
we
are
entirely
outside
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
maliciously?
i
think
that's
stretching.
i
think
that's
stretching
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
think
that's
stretching
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
your
honor.
i'm
conscious
of
the
language
that
we
used.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
don't
think
they
could
but
that
--
that
wouldn't
establish.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
well,
your
honor
reads
judge
hays
opinion
more
broadly
than
i
do.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
not
as
--
no,
i'm
not
abandoning
any
part
of
our
brief.
we
are
immune
but
we're
not
immune
for,
when
i
say
operating
maliciously
or
with
predatory
motives,
or
in
bad
faith
we
are
not
acting
within
the
responsibilities.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
would
say,
yes.
i
would
say,
we
ought
not
to
be
if
the
standard
which
is
applied
to
government
officers
in
performing
a
governmental
function
is
applied
to
us
and
i'm
going
to
argue
that
standard
to
be
applied.
but
i
have,
i
have
a
very
grave
doubt
that
it
will
be
applied.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
would
say
in
essence,
yes.
in
essence,
i
would
say
that's
basically
true.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
but
we
wouldn't
be
acting
within
our
responsibilities.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
that's
right.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
that's
right.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
like
anybody
else.
that
is
precisely
what
i'm
saying,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
well
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
think
all
of
this
reasonableness
is
a
variable
standard
as
is
bad
--
good
or
bad
faith,
maybe
a
variable
standard.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
think
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
think,
mr.
justice
white
that
we
are
not
operating
as
a
hazard
if
this
court
tells
us
that
we
can
operate
on
the
basis
of
good
faith
because
we
believe
that
is
the
only
standard
we
apply
whereas,
if
you
were
to
say
reasonableness
or
unreasonableness
in
the
circumstances,
you
give
us
no
rule
to
go
by.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
well
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
predatory,
as
i
am
using
the
term
is
self-interest
and
not
again,
i
use
mr.
justice
black's
term,
within
our
responsibilities.
if
we're
acting
--
if
we
disregard
our
responsibilities,
i
certainly
am
not
going
to
stand
before
this
court
and
tell
you
that
we
are
immune
from
the
sherman
act,
because
i
don't
think
anybody
is.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
hope
to.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
say
that,
definitely
and
i'm
as
well
deal
with
that
now
because
my
time
is
fast
approaching
the
red
light.
i
say
that
they
did,
if
the
commission
failed
to
act,
i
say
that
they
could
have
gone
in
and
gotten
injunctive
relief
if
they
were
disposed
to
do
it
or
they
show
it.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
because
obviously
they
couldn't
go
in
and
just
merely
say,
we
want
an
injunction,
they
have
to
make
a
showing
that
they
were
entitled
to
it.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
that's
right
and
i'll
tell
you
why
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
that
is
right.
i
will
tell
you
why.
that's
my
opinion.
i
go
a
step
further
than
that.
if
the
court
disagrees
with
me,
i
say,
certainly
under
no
circumstances,
are
we
liable
for
treble
damages
because
i
say
even
if
the
court
disagrees
with
me,
and
i
hope
they
will
not
that
if
another
standard
is
to
be
held,
i
am
convinced
that
we
ought
not
on
the
basis
of
the
duties
imposed
upon
us
and
which
we
are
required
to
enforce,
we
ought
not
to
be
risking
treble
damages
because
the
moment
we
risk
treble
damages
just
at
that
moment,
what
is
there
other
than
an
incentive
to
withdraw
from
acting
when
we
are
required
to
act.
and
after
all
as
said
in
congressional
intent
here
was
not
designed
to
make
us
act
at
our
peril.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i'm
saying
that
we
are
not
--
yes,
i'm
saying
that.
but
i'm
saying
we
are
not
liable.
it
is
my
position.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
that
is
correct.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
well,
i
suppose
they
would
have
--
they
could
have,
i
can
think
of
an
action
in
negligence.
i
can
think
of
an
action
--
action
for
tortious
interference
with
contract.
i
think
that
if
they
succeeded
on
the
tortious
contract
interference
they
would
certainly
have
to
show
and
i
would
think
it
would
be
a
part
--
parcel
of
it,
that
we
had
acted
in
bad
faith.
but
i
--
i
do
not
think
that
they
are
entitled
to
any
damages
and
i
think
the
congress
waived
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
think
that
is
true.
i'd
go
that
far
with
you
and
i
think
they
definitely
did
that
and
i
also
think
that
they
waived
the
damage
to
this
individual,
bear
in
mind
it
was
our
members
that
were
told
to
withdraw
these
wires.
it
was
our
members
who
suffered
the
same
for
all
practical
purposes.
as
far
as
this
business
was
concerned,
they
suffered
the
same
damages.
our
members
have
no
cause
of
action
under
the
antitrust
laws.
our
members
were
then
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
would
think
there
could
be
but
i
have
to
relate
it
to
the
facts
in
the
particular
case.
this
is
what
we're
dealing
with
and
i
say
we
did
act
within
the
scope
of
our
responsibility.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
if
we
didn't?
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
well,
of
course,
i
do
not,
your
honor,
see
it
remotely
as
a
malicious
interference
with
a
contract
or
any
other
right
here.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
which
people's
rights?
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
in
the
--
in
the
present
posture.
in
the
present
posture,
the
case
--
no
because
the
rules
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
if
it's
outside
the
rules
then
obviously,
we
have
immunity.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
my
answer
to
your
honor
is
an
unequivocal
no.
they
can
sue
anywhere,
if
that
be
the
fact.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
may
i
just
rush
ahead
here
because
i
must.
may
i
point
out
to
you
very
briefly
by
a
quotation
of
the
director
of
trading
and
the
exchange
division
of
the
sec,
which
appears
in
28
george
washington
law
review
at
page
223
as
how
the
exchange
and
their
member,
and
the
commission
operates.
he
said
the
exchange
has
governed
themselves
and
the
commission
keeps
in
touch
making
informal
suggestions
for
changes
when
this
seems
indicated.
now,
one
thing
more
--
my
--
the
red
light
is
up.
one
thing
more
--
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
say
to
you
that
you
can
search
the
act
from
beginning
to
end.
you
will
find
no
distinction
between
listed
and
over-the-counter
security
as
my
adversary
contends.
i
say
further
than
that
that
our
rules
which
were
approved
deal
with
wires
with
nonmembers.
specifically,
i
say
further
than
that,
i
oppose
this
petition
for
certiorari
here
because
i
wanted
this
court
to
have
a
complete
record.
it
is
my
opinion
they've
should've
had
a
complete
record.
and
i
say
to
your
honors
at
this
time
that
if
your
honors
do
not
affirm
the
opinion
of
mr.
--
of
the
court
of
appeals,
that
what
should
happen
is
that
this
case
should
be
sent
back
for
a
full
record
so
that
your
honors
can
have
the
advantage
of
a
complete
and
not
a
paper
case.
thank
you.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
certainly.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
that
is
definitely
my
position.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
again,
your
honor,
you're
dealing
when
you
say
arbitrarily
if
i've
say
yes
to
your
honor.
because
i
say
there
is
one
standard
and
one
standard
alone
that
could
apply.
and
that
is,
did
we
proceed
in
good
faith,
we
may
have
been
mistaken.
bear
in
mind
that
there
is
nobody
of
men
that
see
eye
to
eye
on
all
facts
and
circumstances
and
the
people
that
were
adminis
--
administering
this
rule,
they're
human.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
they're
not
insurers.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i
say,
definitely,
your
honor
and
i
say
when
you
say
it's
been
challenged
in
this
case.
with
all
due
respect
to
judge
byrne
and
i
have
respect
for
him.
he
had
no
different
record
than
your
honors
have
before
you
so
that
as
far
as
all
its
finding,
i
say
it's
not
a
finding,
i
say
it
was
an
expression
of
opinion,
he
had
no
powers
greater
than
your
honor
to
come
to
that
conclusion
on
the
identical
record.
mr.
a.
donald
mackinnon
i'd
say
go,
go
further
than
that.
and
i
would
say
in
our
motion
for
summary
judgment,
you
don't
make
findings.
thank
you,
your
honor.
