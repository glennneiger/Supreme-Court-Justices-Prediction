no
application
at
all
was
made
with
respect
to
the
--
justice

stewart
with
propriety
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
is
there
any
explanation
for
that
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct,
it's
difficult
for
me
to
see
how
there
would
be
any
liability
either
the

in
tort
either.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
follow
from
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning,
i
should
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
understand
from
your
brief
that
the
commission
thinks
that
it
has
reviewing
power
over
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
read
the
respondent's
brief
to
say
so,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
don't
you
imply
that
your
brief
said
so,
does
it
--
that
your
brief
says
the
commission
thinks
so.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
your
statement
was
that
nobody
said
so,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
i
--
what's
the
commission's
attitude
about
this,
could
you
tell
us?
justice
potter
stewart
workmen
compensation
and
with
that,
i
think
that's
certainly
obvious,
isn't
it?
securities
exchange
commission
has
had
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
certainly
there
was
no
machinery
to
give
monetary
compensation?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
gather
that
--
again,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
but
i
had
understood
the
petitioner
--
that
the
petitioner
did
disagree
with
you
about
this,
of
this
you're
making
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
well
we
--
the
way
you
stated
it,
it
would
if
you
agree
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
--.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
but
the
petitioner
says
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
statute,
whether
wisely
or
unwisely,
doesn't
the
statute
give
the
commission
power
to
review
any
such
rule?
justice

19
(b)
and
23
(a),
i'm
talking
about.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
it's
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
--
if
it
later
decides
that
any
of
those
rules
(inaudible)
--
has
power
to
change,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
there's
no
dispute,
as
i
understand
it,
that
if
this
were
the
shoe
business
or
the
bakery
business,
the
refrigerator
business
that
this
could
be
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
that
anybody
disputes
that.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
think
it
has
been
made
clear
by
agreement.
