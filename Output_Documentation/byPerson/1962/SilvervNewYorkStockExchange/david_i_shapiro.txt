mr.
david
i.
shapiro
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
legal
issue
of
this
case
is
whether
the
new
york
stock
exchange
is
immune
from
the
antitrust
laws
when
it
requires
its
members
to
boycott
a
non-member.
now
what
are
the
facts
of
this
case?
petitioner,
municipal
securities
company,
which
i
assume
refer
to
in
argument
as
msc
was
a
sole
proprietorship
owned
by
harold
j.
silver
and
was
engaged
in
the
municipal
bond
business
in
dallas,
texas.
municipal
securities
company
incorporated,
which
i
shall
refer
to
as
msc
inc.,
was
formed
by
mr.
silver
in
1958
and
was
engaged
principally
in
the
over-the-counter
corporate
securities
business.
now
both
msc
and
msc
inc.
were
licensed
as
securities
dealers
under
the
laws
of
texas,
were
registered
broker-dealers
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
and
were
members
in
good
standing
of
the
national
association
of
securities
dealers.
neither
msc
nor
msc
inc.
was
a
member
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
in
1956,
in
an
order
to
more
effectively
trade
back
and
forth
with
other
dealers
who
traded
in
municipal
bonds,
msc,
that's
the
proprietorship,
installed
private
telephone
wires
from
its
office
to
the
offices
of
various
dallas
banks
and
to
the
municipal
bond
departments
of
two
and
later
three
firms
who
are
members
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
after
the
formation
of
msc
inc.
in
1958,
private
wires
were
installed
from
the
trading
department
of
the
corporation
to
the
dallas
trading
departments
of
nine
firms
who
are
members
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
msc
inc.
requested
the
stock
exchange
to
approve
these
installations
and
also
requested
that
the
exchange
furnish
it
stock
ticker
or
what
is
otherwise
known
as
continuous
quotations
service.
temporary
approval
was
obtained
and
both
the
private
wires
and
stock
ticker
service
were
installed
during
the
summer
of
1958.
in
the
meantime,
the
exchange
was
carrying
on
a
background
investigation
of
msc
inc.
officers.
then
on
february
12,
1959,
without
notice,
either
the
msc
or
msc
inc.,
exchange
directed
as
member
firms
to
discontinue
all
of
their
private
wire
connections
to
both
msc
and
msc
inc.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
believe
that
they
do,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
correct.
there
is
a
form
in
which
it
appears
that
both
the
member
and
the
non-member
make
application
for
approval.
the
rules,
i
think,
speak
of
member
approval
for
the
establishment
of
such
wires
but
the
form
itself
apparently
is
directed
to
nonmembers.
and
such
a
form
was
made
--
form
application
was
made
in
this
case.
now
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
propriety
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
correct,
sir.
apparently
they
didn't
think
they
needed
one.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no.
apparently
there's
none
at
all.
it
just
wasn't
done.
but
there
were
private
wires.
now,
the
member
firms
upon
receipt
of
the
directive
immediately
complied
with
it
and
by
march
2,
1959,
all
of
petitioners
private
wire
connections
to
member
firms
were
settled.
and
at
the
same
time,
stock
exchange
withdrew
the
stock
ticker
service.
now,
attempts
to
learn
the
reasons
for
the
exchange's
action
proved
futile
since
the
member
firms
didn't
know
and
couldn't
find
out
the
reasons
for
the
exchange's
action,
mr.
silver
personally
visited
the
exchange
on
february
16,
1959.
he
was
there
told
by
walter
coleman,
the
assistant
director
of
the
exchange's
department
of
member
firms
that
the
exchange
had
a
long
standing
policy
against
giving
the
reasons
for
its
disapproval
action.
on
february
26,
mr.
silver
wrote
to
mr.
g.
keith
funston,
president
of
the
exchange,
and
explained
that
irreparable
damage
was
being
inflicted
upon
the
financial
condition
and
reputation
of
his
firm.
mr.
silver
stated
and
i
quote,
“i
appeal
to
your
sense
of
justice
and
ask
for
the
following.
(1)
temporary
reinstatement
of
the
services.
(2)
that
we
be
advised
of
the
reasons
for
the
action
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
and,
(3)
that
we
be
given
an
opportunity
to
answer
any
charges
and
present
whatever
information
you
may
require.”
on
march
4,
1959,
mr.
funston
replied
as
follows
and
again
i
quote,
“thank
you
for
writing
to
me
about
your
problem.
well,
i
can
understand
your
position
and
wanting
to
know
specific
reasons
for
the
recent
action
taken
by
the
exchange
in
connection
with
private
wiring
ticker
service
to
your
organization.
i
am
sure
you
can
also
understand
our
position
in
defining
to
furnish
such
details.
before
taking
any
such
action,
the
exchange
always
makes
a
very
careful
and
very
thorough
investigation.
i
personally
reviewed
the
scope
and
results
of
such
investigation
of
this
case
and
feel
that
the
exchange
acted
properly.”
end
quote.
on
the
6th
of
april,
1959,
petitioners
commenced
for
this
suit
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
prayed
for
injunctive
relief
mandamus.
later,
on
the
petitioners'
motion
for
partial
summary
judgment,
the
exchange
for
the
first
time
revealed
its
reasons
for
terminating
petitioners'
wire
connections.
the
exchange
asserted
that
it
took
the
action
it
did
because,
one;
its
investigation
had
turned
up
certain
scurrilous
matter
with
respect
to
the
silvers.
the
nature
of
which
your
honors
has
been
disclosed
neither
to
the
petitioners,
to
petitioners'
counsel
or
even
to
the
courts
below.
two,
the
silvers'
sold
certain
shares
of
the
u.s.
hoffman
machinery
corporation
in
1955,
2
months
after
acquiring.
although
at
the
time
of
acquisition,
they
stated
they
had
no
present
intention
of
selling.
three
msc
inc.'s
application
for
private
wire
connection
approval
omitted
from
a
long
list
of
corporate
connections
covering
a
ten
year
period,
the
names
of
two
corporations
with
which
mr.
silver
had
been
connected.
and
four,
and
perhaps
the
most
important,
in
1953,
some
six
years
prior
to
the
exchanges'
action,
the
defense
department
had
suspended
the
security
clearance
of
a
corporation,
not
one
of
those
omitted
from
msc
inc.'s
application
in
which
the
silvers
were
principal
officers.
now
the
district
court
considered
each
of
the
four
grounds
relied
on
by
the
exchanges'
justification
for
its
actions.
and
it
found
and
i
quote,
“first,
the
record
fails
to
substantiate
these
charges
against
the
silvers.
that's
on
page
229.
second,
the
conduct
of
the
exchange
could
not
be
justified
by
the
denial
of
security
clearance
nor
by
any
of
the
other
facts
and
circumstances
on
which
it
relied.
that's
at
232.
and
third,
the
exchange
acted
arbitrarily
and
unreasonably
in
directing
that
plaintiffs'
wire
connection
will
be
settled.
and
that's
at
page
233.”
now
these
findings
were
in
no
way
disturbed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
district
court
held
that
the
termination
of
petitioners'
wire
connectors
constituted
a
per
se
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
and
upon
the
exchanges'
defense
that
it
was
immune
from
the
antitrust
laws,
the
district
court
held
as
follows
and
i'm
going
to
quote
it
because
this
is
the
position,
we
are
asserting
before
this
court,
and
we
think
it's
absolutely
right.
quote,
“providing
that
its
members
do
not
indulge
in
conduct
which
is
illegal
or
inconsistent
with
just
and
equitable
principles
of
trade
and
exchange
has
neither
the
power
nor
the
authority
to
determine
with
whom
its
members
may
or
may
not
deal
or
to
direct
them
to
desist
from
dealing
with
non-member
broker
dealers
engaged
in
transactions
and
over-the-counter
securities
and
municipal
bonds.
if
it
does
so,
it
does
so
at
its
peril
and
is
subject
to
such
appropriate
action
as
may
be
taken
under
the
antitrust
laws.”
on
appeal,
a
divided
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
majority
held
that
while
there
would
have
been
little
doubt
as
to
the
illegality
of
the
exchanges'
action,
if
it
had
not
been
insulated
from
liability
under
the
antitrust
laws,
its
actions
in
this
case
was
within
the
general
scope
of
its
authority
under
the
securities
exchange
act.
and
hence,
the
exchange
was
immune
from
liability
under
the
sherman
act,
judge
waterman
dissented.
now,
as
its
claim
from
the
face
of
the
act,
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
provides
no
explicit
antitrust
immunity
or
actions
taken
by
registered
securities
exchanges
and
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
held,
no
immunity
will
be
implied
unless
of
course
there
is
a
clear
repugnancy
between
this
case
and
the
securities
exchange
act
and
the
antitrust
laws
and
then
only
to
the
extent
of
the
repugnancy.
in
this
case,
your
honors,
there
is
no
repugnancy,
clear
or
otherwise.
in
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934,
congress
empowered
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
to
discipline
exchange
members.
and
it
required
the
exchanges
themselves
to
discipline
members
who
violated
ethical
business
standards.
with
respect
to
nonmembers
however,
congress
provided
that
regulation
be
conducted
by
the
sec.
and
this
was
to
be
accomplished
by
the
broker-dealer
registration
provisions
of
the
1934
act
which
in
1938
was
supplemented
by
a
program
of
self-regulation
in
the
field
of
business
ethics.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes
sir,
there
was
in
the
complaint.
there
was
a
cause
of
action
under
the
american
tobacco
doctrine
for
the
intentional
infliction
of
harm
and
there
was
also
i
believe
a
cause
of
action
for
malicious
interference
with
contractual
relations.
now,
we
cite
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
on
the
foot
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
couldn't
agree
with
your
honor
more.
i
mean,
we
don't
have
any
liability
here
under
the
sherman
act.
we
haven't
got
any
place.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
so,
i
would
think.
we
say
--
but
what
it
did
was
it
held
that
there
was
no
liability
under
the
sherman
act
and
remanded
to
determine
for
the
district
court
to
seek
out
a
remedy
as
to
whether
or
not
there
might
be
some
sort
of
relief
in
terms
of
a
judicially
created
remedy
in
the
form
of
damages
or
injunctive
relief.
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
give
any
direction
to
the
district
court
as
to
what
remedy
there
should
be.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
it
did
not
say
it
wasn't.
it
just
said
there
wasn't
any
under
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
and
find
some
other
law.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
there
was.
there
was
such
an
implication
on
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
we
say
that
while
the
1934
act,
in
no
way
affected
the
right
of
the
exchange's
to
discipline
their
own
members
even
for
derelictions
in
over-the-counter
transactions
that
is
off
the
exchange
itself.
power
to
prevent
abuses
by
nonmembers
was
vested
not
in
the
exchanges
but
in
the
sec
and
later
in
1938
in
the
sec
and
national
association
of
securities
dealers.
accordingly
we
say,
section
6
(b)
of
the
1934
act,
which
requires
an
exchange
to
make
an
enforced
rules
for
the
discipline
of
its
members
for
member
misconduct
provides
no
antitrust
immunity
for
exchange
action
against
nonmembers.
and
in
this
case,
the
exchanges'
action
was
admittedly
directed
not
against
illegal
or
unethical
member
conduct
but
against
non-members
belief
to
be,
and
i
quote
from
the
district
court's
opinion,
“untrustworthy
persons
of
doubtful
character.”
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
it
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
that
even
with
regard
to
members
that
the
exchange
has
got
to
show
them
some
sort
of
due
process
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
exchanges'
rules
provide
a
great
deal
of
procedural
due
process
for
its
members
but
provide
absolutely
none
for
nonmembers.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
would
think
it
would
be
under
the
sherman
act
as
well.
and
the
--
in
that
connection
i
might
say
that
i
think
that
the
government's
brief
in
this
case
which
is
filed
amicus
curiae
that
we
had
been
members
instead
of
nonmembers,
i
think
their
brief
would
be
absolutely
correct.
but
since
we
are
nonmembers,
i'm
going
to
say
why
we
think
it's
incorrect
in
just
a
moment.
we
think
the
government
is
in
error
when
it
asserts
that
immunity
as
to
action
against
non-members
turns
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
exchanges'
determination
after
notice
of
hearing.
a
private
organization
as
we
understand
the
antitrust
laws
cannot
immunize
itself
from
the
sherman
act
by
establishing
extrajudicial
tribunals
even
though
they
purport
to
give
what
looks
like
due
process.
and
we
say
the
district
court
correctly
held
that
so
long
as
exchange
members
themselves
do
not
indulge
in
conduct
which
is
illegal
or
inconsistent
with
just
and
equitable
principles
of
trade
and
exchange
has
neither
the
power
nor
authority
to
tell
them
with
whom
to
deal,
with
whom
not
to
deal.
now,
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
at
this
point
in
the
argument
that
the
exchanges'
rule
against
non-approved
wire
connections
as
applied
in
this
case
had
the
effect
of
excluding
the
petitioners
from
a
substantial
part
of
the
over-the-counters
securities
market.
and
this
is
graphically
illustrated
at
page
76
of
the
record.
and
i
ask
the
court
to
turn
with
me
with
just
a
moment
at
page
76.
the
exhibit
facing
page
76
shows
msc
inc.'s
private
wire
network
immediately
prior
to
the
exchanges'
directive
of
february
12,
1959.
incidentally,
your
honors,
there's
a
typographical
error
here.
the
date
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
should
be
february
1,
1959,
not
february
1,
1960.
now,
after
the
new
york
stock
exchange
member
firms
complied
with
the
exchanges'
directive,
msc
inc.'s
private
wire
connections
were
reduced
to
those
four
which
is
shown
below
the
box
marked
msc
inc.
it's
all
that
were
left.
and
by
october,
1959,
msc
inc.
was
out
of
business.
now,
msc
the
proprietorship,
used
its
private
wires
with
member
firms
solely
to
obtain
quotations
in
municipal
securities,
in
municipal
bonds
not
listed
for
trading
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
and
msc
inc.,
that's
a
corporation,
did
know
listed
business
over
its
private
wires
with
a
number
of
exchange
member
firms.
in
this
connection,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
the
order
of
the
district
court,
in
no
way
affected
the
exchanges'
right
to
regulate
its
members
with
respect
to
their
manner
of
reporting
transactions
upon
the
exchange.
in
fact,
it
was
specifically
restricted
to
private
wired
connections
which
were
used
for
trading
or
otherwise
dealing
and
then
i
quote
again,
”securities
not
listed
for
trading
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange.”
we
say
therefore
that
in
this
case,
there
is
no
supersession
to
an
extent
problem,
no
repugnancy
problem,
whatsoever.”
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
right.
our
position
would
be
exactly
the
same
so
long
as
it
did
not
involve
member
misconduct.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
correct.
unless
(inaudible)
--
as
i
say,
it
involved
member
misconduct.
and
then
of
course,
the
action
would
be
against
the
members
themselves
for
engaging
in
such
misconducts.
and
there's
plenty
of
power
in
the
sec
and
in
the
exchange
themselves
to
prevent
any
such
kind
of
thing
from
occurring.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
your
honor.
if
the
exchange
--
would
it
tell
a
member
at
this
particular
point,
you've
given
your
wire
to
a
known
racketeer
and
we
want
you
to
be
very
careful
in
your
dealings
with
him.
and
it
should
happen
that
the
exchange
member
is
very
careful
and
every
single
one
of
the
dealings
that
the
member
has,
with
the
known
racketeer,
are
completely
illegal,
completely
in
accordance
with
the
sec's
rules
and
regulations,
i
would
say
that
the
exchange
has
no
power
to
cut
that
wire
off.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
it
has
such
a
rule,
i
believe.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
i
do
not
question
the
power
of
the
exchange
to
police
the
exchange.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
will
require
it
to
police
their
members.
what
they
were
not
required
to
do,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
were
given
no
authority
to
do
was
to
police
people
other
than
non-members.
and
in
the
securities
business
that
was
taken
care
of
by
a
comprehensive
scheme
of
legislation
which
completely
excludes
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
for
this
reason,
your
honor,
and
not
because
the
statute
doesn't
talk,
6
(b)
does
it,
doesn't
talk
in
terms
of
regulation.
it
talks
in
terms
of
discipline
for
member
misconduct
and
that's
what
the
exchanges
were
required
to
do,
discipline
members
who
engaged
in
member
misconduct.
now
that's
the
only
requirement
they've
got
under
6
(b).
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
it
depends
in
this
particular
connection
on
the
kind
of
thing
we're
talking
about.
if
we're
talking
about
a
private
wired
connection
in
which
--
which
is
restricted
to
a
market
other
than
the
exchange
market,
my
answer
would
be
they
have
no
power
at
all.
with
regard
to
a
private
wire
which
involved,
or
the
stock
ticker
service
which
involved
quotations
upon
the
exchange,
i
would
say
in
that
connection
that
the
exchange
has
a
reasonable
right
that
the
district
court
held
to
protect
its
property
interest
and
its
own
quotations.
that's
as
far
as
i'm
willing
to
go.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
i
think
we
can
in
the
light
of
the
order
of
the
district
court
which
clearly
restricted
the
injunctive
relief
here
to
private
wires
which
were
used
for
transactions
not
taking
place
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
now,
let's
take
a
look
at
this
supersessional
repugnancy
problem
for
just
a
moment.
section
6
(c)
of
the
1934
act
which
permits
the
exchange
to
adapt
and
enforce
any
rule
not
inconsistent
with
the
act
has
got
to
be
read
together
with
section
19
(b).
well,
that
section
authorizes
the
sec
to
order
or
supplement
an
exchanges'
rules
with
respect
to
such
matters
as
the
reporting
of
transactions
on
the
exchange
and
upon
tickers
maintained
by
or
with
the
consent
of
the
exchange.
and
we
think
its
plain,
the
19
(b)
does
not
include
private
wires
between
members
and
nonmembers
which
are
used
to
communicate
with
respect
to
transactions
and
over-the-counter
markets.
or
a
private
wire
connection
is
to
the
over-the-counter
market,
precisely
what
the
ticker
is
to
the
new
york
stock
exchange
or
any
other
exchange
market.
furthermore
we
say,
there's
nothing
either
in
the
1934
act
or
its
legislative
history
that
reveals
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
was
given
power
to
decide
antitrust
issues
as
such.
where
--
while
we
agree
that
antitrust
considerations
are
relevant
to
the
performance
of
the
commission's
functions
on
the
19
(b),
there
is
no
pervasive
regulatory
scheme
including
the
antitrust
laws
that's
been
entrusted
to
the
commission.
because
admittedly,
unless
everybody
agrees
with,
including
the
majority
below,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
lacks
power
to
grant
relief
against
the
wire
connection
rule
as
applied.
we've
got
no
standing
to
complain
before
the
commission.
and
so
as
the
district
court
pointed
out
and
i
quote,
“if
the
theory
of
the
exchange
were
correct,
plaintiffs
would
not
only
have
no
remedy
before
the
commission
but
it
would
also
find
themselves
barred
from
remedy
in
the
courts
on
the
mere
say
so
of
a
private
association.
this
is
in
mark
contrast
to
what
occurs
in
a
recognized
closed
regulatory
system.”
end
quote.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes
sir.
they
can
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
are
you
asking
me,
did
they
sir?
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
they
could.
they
have
that
power
under
the
statute.
they
of
course
did
not.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
oh
yes.
they
put
him
out
of
business
without
any
question
under
the
--
under
the
1934
and
1938
acts,
there
is
a
complete
scheme
of
regulation
with
respect
to
over-the-counter
dealers
and
brokers.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
1938
act,
there
was
a
specific
immunity
given
for
a
policing
system
set
up
through
the
national
association
of
securities
dealers
which
deals
with
the
problem
of
business
ethics
of
over-the-counter
securities
dealers.
now,
the
1934
act,
i
think
we
have
to
face
this,
was
adopted
primarily
because
the
new
york
stock
exchange
failed
to
police
the
conduct
of
its
own
membership.
the
majority
below
treated
this
statute
as
granting
to
the
very
same
new
york
stock
exchange
authority
to
regulate
the
entire
securities
industry
because
that's
the
effect
of
the
decision
below.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
say
that
it
should
be
reversed.
i
should
like
to
save
whatever
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
really
a
very
simple
case,
when
unfortunately
after
listening
to
the
arguments
of
both
the
solicitor
general
and
my
opponent
i
think
it's
become
very
tangled
indeed.
first
of
all,
there
are
a
couple
of
things
i'd
like
to
get
straightened
up
right
at
the
outset.
under
section
16
of
the
clayton
act,
which
is
15
u.s.
code
section
26,
any
private
individual
may
obtain
injunctive
relief
under
the
sherman
antitrust
act.
that's
been
the
law
since
1914,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
this
court
so
held
in
the
bedford-stonecutters
case
and
that
was
decided,
i
believe
in
1926.
now,
the
cause
of
action
in
this
case
is
in
one
sense,
a
plain
ordinary
concerted
refusal
to
deal
on
the
part
of
the
member
firms
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
who
were
named
as
co-conspirators
with
the
exchange
in
this
case.
but
it's
more
than
that.
it's
more
than
that.
it
has
also
concerted
action
among
competitors
to
exclude
another
competitor
from
a
substantial
market.
and
we
say,
because
this
is
really
the
reason
that
the
solicitor
general
is
so
concerned
about
in
this
case.
he's
concerned
because
of
the
fact
that
he
thinks
that
it
may,
if
you
apply
the
per
se
rule
here,
you
may
weaken
the
concept
to
self-regulation.
we
don't
have
that
problem
here,
let
me
tell
you
why.
we
don't
have
the
problem
because
it
is
just
as
much
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
per
se
for
competitors
to
foreclose
another
competitor
from
any
substantial
market
as
it
is
for
competitors
to
foreclose
competition
among
themselves.
and
in
this
case,
the
record
is
clear
that
the
over-the-counter
dealers
who
were
the
member
firms
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
with
whom
these
petitioners
have
private
wires,
were
competitors
of
these
petitioners
in
the
over-the-counter
market
in
dallas.
and
what
happened
was,
is
that
the
combined
action
of
the
exchange
and
its
member
firms
in
the
dallas
area
excluded
these
petitioners
from
the
dallas
market,
force
them
out
of
business.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
they
just
be
a
plain
(voice
overlap)
violation
of
the
antitrust
law.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
i
think
i'd
like
to
make
that
very
clearly.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
now,
the
only
other
problem
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no.
i
assert
that
it's
a
per
se
violation.
i
believe
that
the
solicitor
general
does
but
i
am
sure
that
mr.
mackinnon
does
not.
and
he
did
not
--
he
certainly,
vigorously
opposed
the
application
of
the
per
se
rule
in
the
district
court.
and
the
district
court
didn't
agree
with
it.
now,
i
think
the
real
problem
that's
posed
by
this
case
was
posed
by
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question
to
me
yesterday.
and
i'd
like
to
deal
with
that
if
i
may,
because
that's
really
not
a
problem.
it
just
looks
like
it's
a
problem.
we
were
talking
yesterday
about
this
fellow
who
was
an
ex-racketeer
who
--
the
question
was
caught
as
to
whether
or
not
the
exchange
had
the
power
to
order
its
member
firms
to
discontinue
its
wires
to
that
person.
well,
i
think
we've
got
to
distinguish
the
case
of
the
ex-racketeer
from
the
case
of
the
bucket
shop
because
let's
talk
first
about
the
bucket
shop.
if
we
talk
about
the
bucket
shop
and
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
exchange
tells
a
member
firm,
stop
dealing
with
the
bucket
shop
and
the
member
firm
says,
no.
what
we're
talking
about
at
that
point
is
member
misconduct.
if
we're
talking
about
a
situation
where
there
are
qualifications
involved,
the
qualifications
of
this
ex-racketeer
to
engage
in
the
securities
business,
well
he
can't
be
qualified
to
engage
in
this
business
unless
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
says
that
it's
all
right
for
him
to
engage
in
this
business
and
that's
gone
from
section
15
of
the
broker-dealer
registration
provisions
of
the
1934
act.
and
they
comment,
“the
criteria
set
forth
in
section
15
are
the
only
criteria
that
congress
has
laid
down
for
admission
into
the
securities
business.”
now,
if
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
says,
“yes
mr.
ex-racketeer,
we
think
you
have
shown
a
sufficient
rehabilitation,
so
that
you
should
now
engage
in
this
business.”
who
is
the
new
york
stock
exchange
to
say,
“no,
you
cannot.”
and
that
is
precisely
the
point
i
am
making
because
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
it
does.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
there
is
i
think
a
very
substantial
difference
in
this
sense.
it
is
illegal
under
the
act
to
run
--
it
may
be
a
violation
of
the
securities
exchange
act
to
operate
a
bucket
shop
in
interstate
commerce
but
the
problem
here
is,
is
a
completely
different
kind
of
situation.
in
the
one
hand,
you've
got
a
problem
involving
the
misconduct
of
a
member.
and
in
the
other,
you
have
the
exchange
superimposing
upon
the
governmental
agency
charged
with
the
responsibility
in
the
area
in
the
first
instance.
its
standards
of
what
the
qualifications
are
for
individuals
to
engage
in
this
business.
and
that
does
not
involve
member
misconduct.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
think
not,
your
honor.
because
there
of
course,
who
would
be
predicated
upon
his
own
knowledge
of
the
operation
that
he
was
involved
in.
and
if
he
was
involved
in
that
operation,
certainly,
we
have
a
case
of
member
misconduct.
and
precisely,
that's
what
the
solicitor
general
was
talking
about
when
he
was
talking
about
the
sec's
power
under
section
19
(a)
3
of
the
act.
because
19
(a)
3
is
clearly
a
section
which
goes
to
member
misconduct,
the
commission
may
remove
from
an
exchange
any
member
who
with
knowledge
of
the
violation
affects
a
nonmember's
transaction.
what
are
we
talking
about?
we're
not
talking
about
the
regulation
or
the
regulation
of
nonmembers
in
this
sense.
we're
talking
about
member
misconduct.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
solicitor
general
and
i
are
talking
about
the
same
thing,
except
we're
saying
it
differently.
but
it's
in
the
saying
it
differently
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
this
case
and
makes
it
an
easy
case
or
makes
it
a
difficult
case.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
right.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
quite
right
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
--
but
i
say
more
than
that.
i
say
because
congress
was
scrupulous
in
providing
procedural
due
process
for
anyone
who
was
subjected
to
broker-dealer
registration
revocation
under
the
act.
and
they
provided
it
when
you
are
faced
with
the
disciplinary
proceeding
by
the
nasd.
they
provided
it
when
you
were
faced
with
a
disciplinary
proceeding
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
yet
in
this
case
where
you
have
disciplinary
proceedings
against
a
nonmember
on
the
basis
of
qualifications,
there's
no
due
process
because
the
exchange
constitution
and
rules
applies
only
procedural
due
process.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
the
word,
only,
only
for
members
and
absolutely
none
for
nonmembers.
the
exchange
made
the
representation
at
congress.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
appreciate
that
but
let's
take
a
look
at
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
if
the
exchange
had
the
power
that
it
says
it
has,
and
this
court
gives
it
to
him,
it's
got
the
power
also
to
regulate
the
relations
between
members
of
the
exchange
and
members
of
other
registered
securities
exchanges
in
connection
with
private
wires
relating
to
over-the-counter
securities
transactions
or
securities
transactions
on
an
exchange
other
than
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
they
can
do
that,
too.
and
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
this
other
registered
securities
exchanges
are
in
direct
competition
with
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
and
it
seems
to
me
inconceivable
that
congress
struck
a
balance
here
of
permitting
the
new
york
stock
exchange
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
its
competitors.
and
actually
congress
did
know
such
thing,
because
the
balance
that
has
been
drawn
by
the
solicitor
general
is
in
our
view
an
erroneous
balance.
what
he's
talking
about
is
a
balance
between
protection
of
the
investor
and
the
rights
of
the
individual
broker-dealer.
that's
not
the
balance
to
be
drawn
in
this
case.
the
balance
to
be
drawn
is
the
rights
involved
in
the
antitrust
laws
competition
and
the
rights
of
self-regulation
of
the
exchange's.
the
solicitor
general
can't
draw
that
balance.
i
can't
draw
it
and
this
court
can't
draw
it.
congress
rule
it
and
they
drew
it
in
section
6
(b)
of
the
1934
act,
where
they
said
and
i
quote,
“no
registration
shall
be
granted
or
remain
enforced
unless
the
rules
of
the
exchange
include
provision
for
the
expulsion,
suspension,
or
disciplining
of
a
member
for
conduct
or
proceeding
inconsistent
with
just
and
equitable
principles
of
trade.”
member
and
member
misconduct
is
precisely
the
extent
to
which
there
can
be
any
conceivable
repugnancy
between
the
securities
exchange
act
and
the
sherman
antitrust
act.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
believe
they
might
say
that
they
couldn't
extend
wire
connections
to
another
member
where
that
wire
was
used
exclusively
for
carrying
on
transactions
in
securities
listed
for
trading
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
but
you
even
have
problems
in
that
area,
substantial
problems.
because
as
i
understand
it,
you
must
have
reason
of
--
the
question
then
would
turn
on
an
ap
application,
whether
or
not
there
is
--
anybody
can
enter
and
become
a
member
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
and
you
have
a
very
serious
associated
press
problem
in
that
kind
of
context.
but
i
think
there
possibly
might
be
some
sort
of
rep
--
of
restriction
in
that
area
with
of
course
these
underlying
problems
at
present.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
under
section
6
(b),
to
do
what
they
did
in
this
case.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
right,
your
honor.
if
and
this
is
the
practical
problem,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
said
they
are
not
bad
for
the
trade.
what
we're
saying
is
this
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
it
didn't
give
them
any
antitrust
immunity
because
that
wasn't
the
basis
upon
which
the
commission
does
not
purport,
as
i
understand
it.
it
does
not
purport
to
grant
any
antitrust
immunity
when
it
approves
the
rules
and
of
exchange.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no.
what
they
would
attempt
to
regulate
their
members,
yes.
but
they
wouldn't
apply
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
pass
on
the
qualifications
of
nonmember
dealings
with
members.
that
i
think
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
correct
unless
we
had
what
was
involved
under
6
(b),
member
misconduct.
now,
for
example,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
if
in
fact
there
were
relationships
between
an
illegal
operation
at
a
member
firm
and
the
member
firm
was
aware
of
it,
this
of
course
is
member
misconduct.
what
the
exchange
is
seeking
is
an
installation
of
its
members
but
that
installation
is
provided
in
the
first
instance
under
the
scheme
of
this
statute
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
any
other
way,
any
other
construction
of
these
statutes,
and
it's
really
a
very
comprehensive
one,
would
throw
the
complete
scheme
of
regulation
in
my
view,
out
of
kilter.
i
want
to
say
one
other
thing
with
regard
to
the
question
of
remedy.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that
is
correct
as
long
as
it
doesn't
involve
member
misconduct
itself.
if
it
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
who
have
a
bad
reputation?
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
who
have
a
bad
reputation.
if
it's
an
act
that's
involved
as
distinguished
from
reputation,
you've
got
a
completely
different
problem.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
don't
think
the
commission
could
approve
such
a
rule.
but
they
couldn't
envision
that
it
would
have
such
an
application.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
i
would
say
that
in
that
case
the
exchange
can.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
because
the
mem
--
once
the
member
had
been
put
on
notice
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
if
the
--
i
think
that
if
the
member
does
not
know
then
it
does
not
involve
member
misconduct.
but
if
a
member
does
know
and
he
continues
to
do
so
after
he's
been
given
notice,
you
have
a
question
perhaps
of
member
misconduct.
what
i'm
saying
is
i'm
trying
to
restrict
it
to
this
particular
kind
of
situation
where
we
have
a
question
of
reputation.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
what
it
could
do
would
--
as
long
it
could
keep
--
put
the
member
unnoticed
and
if
that
member
acted
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
violate
any
rules
of
the
exchange
or
ethical
business
conduct
in
his
relation
with
that
nonmember,
the
exchange
has
no
power
to
cut
off
the
wire
in
that
instance.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
with
a
nonmember
who
has
a
bad
reputation.
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
right.
that's
my
position.
i
wanted
to
make
one
more
statement.
i
realize
my
time
is
over
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
my
answer
would
be
the
same
because
that's
precisely
the
criteria
that's
covered
under
section
15
of
the
broker-dealer
registration
provisions
of
the
1934
act,
and
in
such
a
case,
it
may
be.
let's
take
for
example,
the
man
was
adjudged,
had
a
conviction
for
a
felony
20
years
before.
the
sec's
provision,
the
provision
set
forth
in
the
statute
is
conviction
of
10
years
or
less.
if
the
stock
exchange
wanted
to
impose
a
requirement
of
20
years,
high
aid
as
between
the
conviction
and
the
entering
into
the
business,
my
answer
would
be
precisely
the
same.
now,
the
point
i
did
want
to
make
is
this,
and
that's
with
regards
to
this
question
of
remedy
and
i
can
make
this
very
clear.
the
sec's
general
counsel
in
response
to
a
question
put
to
him
by
judge
hays
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
expressly
told
that
court
that
these
petitioners
had
no
remedy
before
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
that's
my
argument.
