[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
doing
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
thought
it
to
say
and
you
won't
–
[inaudible]
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you're
saying
is
that
we
should
hold
that
they
are
not
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws,
they
have
acted
without
sufficient
evidence,
what
a
reasonable
man
would
act,
and
that
if
they
have
acted,
could've
done
that,
they
are
liable
under
the
antitrust
laws,
given
them
the
exemption
there.
but
it
would
seem
to
me
if
you're
looking
for
facets
in
the
law
that
would
come
near
it
--
malicious
interference
of
the
man's
right
to
contract
rather
than
to
engraft
such
an
exception
in
antitrust
laws
that
you
first
look
to
see
if
they
have
acted
--
in
doing
what
they
did,
and
then
say,
that
although
they
are
given
the
right
to
do
what
they
are
doing,
they
violate
the
antitrust
act
by
doing
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
malicious
interference
of
the
contract
does
not
mean
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
outside
of
the
fact
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
composed
of
--
has
official
appointed
by
the
government.
what's
the
difference
in
the
philosophy
of
what
you
have
just
read
to
us
and
the
philosophy
of
that
act
which
imposes
the
duty
to
enact
regulations
and
acts
through
government
agency?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
subject
to
the
supervision
of
the
mechanism?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
had
charge
with
responsibility
by
a
government
enactment
to
do
these
things
and
do
them
as
the
act
confirms.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it's
not
--
it's
not
merely
that
you
were
charged
for
doing
your
business
in
a
certain
way;
you're
charge
with
the
duty
of
regulating
the
conducts
of
other
people
by
your
rules
and
the
kind
of
which
government
prescribes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
which
it
could
do
directly
to
the
commission.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
you
make
a
mistake?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happens
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
performing
the
governmental
function
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
performing
a
government
function?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
government
official
performed
a
function,
the
same
function,
under
what
circumstances
could
they
be
held
liable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
the
secretary
of
agriculture
be
sued
for
removing
somebody
from
a
--
from
a
place
that
he
held?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice

authority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
any
circumstances?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that
last
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
they
could
get
an
injunction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
stock
exchange
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
they
couldn't
get
it
under
the
sherman
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
say
they
could
get
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
why
do
we
have
to
decide
this
other
question
if
they
can
get
an
injunction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
they
have
lay
--
put
it
--
attributed
it
to
the
wrong
act
but
they
had
a
right
to
issue
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
brief?
what
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
quite
answer
the
question,
what
you've
read?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
--
i've
always
understood
there
could
be
an
injunction
issued
for
violating
the
antitrust
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
government.
do
you
think
that
the
private
person
can
get
it
under
that
same
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
equit
--
under
the
equitable
power
of
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
could
get
that
anyway.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
by
that,
are
we
to
imply
by
--
in
what
you've
said
that
if
there
was
a
lack
of,
“good
faith,”
whatever
that
is.
that
you
could
be
sued
for
--
under
the
antitrust
law
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
you're
acting
in
bad
faith,
you
would
simply
not
be
acting
under
the
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
not
be
acting
under
the
rule,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you're
acting
in
bad
faith.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
saying
is
if
you
are
not
acting
in
bad
faith,
you're
not
allowed
to
do
it
by
rule
which
the
commission
has
approved.
you
could
be
held
liable
for
violating
the
antitrust
law
in
this
respect
like
anybody
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
understand
it
better
that
way
than
in
the
concept
of
good
faith.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
i'm
--
maybe
i
am
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
you
didn't
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
didn't
do
that?
i
have
trouble
in
seeing
why
it
wouldn't
be
a
--
whether
that
should
be
enough
under
this
statement
of
facts
you
possibly
go
typical,
malicious
interference
with
contracts.
i
do
have
a
little
difficulty
at
the
present
time
in
seeing
if
it
would
be
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
you
have
done
this
without
authority
of
the
law
that
the
rule
doesn't
allow
you
to
do
it.
what
you've
done
is
to
go
out
and
interfere
with
these
people's
rights
to
make
a
contract,
couldn't
you
be
sued?
justice
hugo
l.
black
these
people
who
are
suing
you.
interfering
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
assuming
that
it
was
outside
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
immunity
obviously,
if
it's
outside
of
the
rule,
if
you
go
out
maliciously
interfere
with
that
contract,
is
there
any
state
in
the
union
where
you
couldn't
--
they
couldn't
sue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
understand
that
rather
than
i
can
concept
of
applying
the
treble
damage
part
of
the
antitrust
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask?
are
you
saying
if
i
get
the
full
implication
which
is,
are
you
saying
that
the
exchange
is
without
power
under
this
section
6
--
in
19
(a),
whatever
the
one
you
just
raised.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
while
they
have
power
to
regulate
their
members
with
reference
to
their
members
conduct
in
most
respect,
they
cannot
regulate
their
members
conduct
in
such
ways
to
bar
--
bar
them
from
dealing
with
someone
deemed
to
be
bad
and
bad
for
the
trade?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
about
the
approval
of
the
rule
by
the
commission
that
it
didn't
(voice
overlap)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
getting
down
to
the
actual
conduct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
this
rule
that
they
had
didn't
show
on
its
face
that
they
would
attempt
to
regulate
their
members
in
that
dealing
with
nonmembers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
couldn't
do
that
without
regard
to
how
bad
the
man
more
--
as
i'm
assuming
or
that
might
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
engaged
in
a
lawless
business
or
a
company
might
be
dedicated
to
violating
the
law
that
the
exchange
could
not
pass
a
regulation
which
barred
its
members
from
dealing
with
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
to
despite
your
statement
is
simple,
now
the
first
thing
(inaudible)
and
i
presently
believe,
do
i
understand
you
then
to
say
that
while
they
can
regulate
their
member's
misconduct,
they
cannot
bar
their
members
from
dealing
with
somebody
else
on
account
of
--
to
a
nonmember
on
account
of
their
misconduct?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
they
can't
make
member
misconduct
define
it
as
being
dealing
with
nonmembers
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
are
bad
--
who
are
bad
themselves.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
the
commission
could
not
approve
such
a
rule,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
call
it
a
bad
man?
