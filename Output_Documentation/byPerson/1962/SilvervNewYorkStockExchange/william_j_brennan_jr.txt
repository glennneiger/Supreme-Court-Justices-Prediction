justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
because
of
the
implication
that
there
might
be
some
equitable
remedy
charged
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that
--
and
if
--
is
that
power
comprehends
action
which
they
found
in
violations
could
affect
these
wire
services?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you're
going
to
spell
out
what
you
mean
by
in
truth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
with
just
an
honest
belief
that
you
place
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what's
the
--
what's
the
cause
of
action?
is
this
something
we
fashion
now
or
is
for
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
specifically
mr.
solicitor,
is
this
to
say
if
the
--
if
this
appears
and
they
could
prove
abuse
of
the
privilege,
they
would
have
a
cause
of
action
for
treble
damages?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
truth
does
not
mean
that
the
suspicions
are
in
fact
proved
that
in
the
sense,
they
are
in
fact
true
but
something
reasonable
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
it
may
have
been
the
wrong?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
mackinnon.
i
don't
think
i
got
that
last
--
we're
only
here
on
the
questions
of
injunction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
it
just
surprised
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
you
mentioned
back
a
moment,
mr.
mackinnon,
certainly,
as
i
understood
the
solicitor
general
yesterday,
he
argued
the
case
as
if
it's
still
a
question
of
the
treble
damage
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
only,
only
for
the
purpose
of
injunctive
relief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
for
the
question
here,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
the
sherman
act,
whether
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
mr.
mackinnon
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
effect
says
we
don't
know
what
you
may
have.
you
don't
have
a
right
of
action
under
the
sherman
act.
you
may
have
a
right
to
at
least,
some
other
way
and
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
see
what
the
district
court
can
find
something
for
you,
isn't
that
in
effect
what
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
isn't
that
--
is
not
in
essence
saying
that
even
if
your
liable
for
some
damages
your
not
liable
for
damages
for
violation
of
the
sherman
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
you
are.
you
are
saying
you're
not
liable
for
damages
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
on
--
what,
what
would
be
the
basis
of
an
action
for
damages
and
assuming
you
are
liable
for
some
damages
but
not
the
damages
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
you
and
the
solicitor
general
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
even
if
he
had
come
to
view,
you
accepted
his
finding,
you
say
they're
effective,
in
one
respect,
it
doesn't
(inaudible)
predatory
and
antitrust,
he
did
not.
