mr.
david
fromson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
may
i
respectfully
decline
the
invitation
of
the
government
to
be
considered
as
a
companion
case
to
the
succeeding
matter?
it
is
our
position,
although
we
would
appreciate
being
in
that
high
company,
that
our
case
is
totally
unrelated
in
the
maine
to
the
succeeding
utah
case.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
at
the
outset
because
it's
very
important
that
that
fact
be
acknowledge
by
all.
the
issue
in
this
case
as
submitted
by
the
government
is
confined
to
the
single
matter
namely,
whether
this
court
should
remand
the
present
action
in
the
court
of
claims
to
a
lower
administrative
body
for
factual
resolution
and
i
am
pleased
to
hear
for
the
first
time
today
that
the
government
is
permitting
the
court
of
claims
to
retain
some
jurisdiction
since
i
had
always
understood
their
position
to
be
that
they
wish
to
complete
divestiture.
we,
however,
have
three
issues.
mr.
david
fromson
a
complete
divestiture
of
their
case.
i
understood
their
position
to
be
that
it
should
be
remanded
to
an
administrative
body
for
all
purposes
and
thereafter
relief
will
be
taken
subsequently
as
may
be
determined
by
the
administrative
body.
mr.
david
fromson
yes
sir.
we
have
three
issues.
our
position
is
firstly
that
our
facts
are
so
unique
that
we
are
beyond
the
bianchi
holding.
secondly,
and
independent
of
that
fact,
we
have
exhausted
our
administrative
remedy.
and
thirdly,
independent
of
these
two,
we
are
properly
before
the
court
of
claims
because
the
interpretation
of
the
documents
before
the
court
constituted
matters
of
the
law
and
i
--
and
its
well
settled
now
that
once
having
established
this
jurisdiction
and
it's
right
to
hear
the
case
on
matters
affecting
law,
it
may
in
a
correlative
coordinate
way,
determine
all
related
factual
issues
in
connection
therewith.
the
government
in
the
maine
correctly
summarized
the
facts
in
this
case.
i
would
not
spend
the
time
to
review
them
in
depth
other
than
to
remind
this
court
most
respectfully
that
at
some
eight
years
ago
that
grace
first
came
in
to
touch
with
its
invitation
forbid.
it
has
reposed
uncomfortably
for
five
years
in
the
court
of
claims
that
the
government
waited
two
and
a
half
years
before
making
its
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
the
court
of
claims,
and
in
that
motion,
never
offered
the
relief
which
it
--
which
it
offers
today.
in
connection
with
the
dispute
clause
which
is
a
part
of
the
papers,
and
if
i
may
revert
for
a
moment,
the
typical
kay
part
situation
is
set
forth
in
anthony
miller
and
that
reference
is
in
page
4
of
my
brief.
so
i
will
not
burden
the
court
with
the
detail
procedure
for
a
kay
part
other
than
to
say
that
the
procedure
is
complicated
and
comprehensive.
and
there
is
unquestionably
here
a
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
the
government
exceeded
the
original
work
and
scope
of
the
work
and
which
wage
determination
would
apply
to
which
portion
of
the
work.
mr.
david
fromson
there
is
no
dispute
in
that,
sir.
mr.
david
fromson
that
is
correct,
sir.
we
would
have
been
content
to
have
remained
within
the
board
level
for
that
purposes
under
the
contract.
mr.
david
fromson
i
believe
so,
sir.
mr.
david
fromson
without
attempting
however
to
interpret
the
rights
of
the
case.
when
the
series
of
disagreements
arose
and
there
was
this
dispute
and
the
government
denied
that
the
request
of
grace
for
the
return
of
its
deposit
and
as
they
subsequently
found
it
was
an
erroneous
decision,
but
nevertheless
on
that
issue,
grace
went
before
the
board
of
contract
appeals.
after
protracted
hearing
there
which
was
not
on
the
merits,
the
trial
examiner
concluded
“beyond
per
adventure
of
doubt”
that
grace
is
not
here
timely.
this
is
an
important
point
to
remember
because
we
are
operating
under
a
unique
dispute
clause.
now
in
bianchi,
we
had
what
might
approach
at
that
time
a
standard
dispute
clause,
but
our
clause
is
so
radically
different
from
that
clause
that
there
is
another
compelling
reason
why
we
should
not
be
considered
within
the
framework
of
bianchi.
however,
when
we
went
before
the
board
of
contract
appeals
and
the
board
commissioner
determined
we
were
not
timely,
we
were
barred
from
any
further
administrative
remedy,
and
our
only
recourse
was
to
assume
and
take
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims
which
we
did.
i
will
have
occasion
in
a
moment
to
advert
to
the
fact
as
to
whether
at
the
refusal
to
consider
the
case
was
in
fact
denying
to
the
board
that
it
had
jurisdiction
because
the
court
of
claims
as
a
fact,
found
that
such
denial
of
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
constitutes
a
denial
of
jurisdiction.
so
in
effect,
the
board
told
us
at
the
lower
level,
we
are
sorry.
we
just
don't
have
jurisdiction
in
this
matter
because
you're
not
timely.
as
a
result
of
the
failure
to
receive
in
the
board,
grace
then
petitioned
in
the
court
of
claims
which
petition
was
answered
in
due
course
and
after
some
two
and
a
half
years,
after
issue
joined
the
government
made
its
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
was
denied
and
the
majority
felt
that
it
should
be
denied
for
all
purposes
there
was
also
this
dissent
all
of
which
is
a
matter
of
record.
mr.
david
fromson
as
to
why
the
government
waited
sir?
mr.
david
fromson
i
don't
know.
mr.
david
fromson
yes
sir.
mr.
david
fromson
as
i
--
i'm
--
i
appreciate
the
court
of
noticing
that
(voice
overlap).
mr.
david
fromson
it
included
everything
because
it
did
not
--
it
was
not
delimited
by
the
standards
raised
which
as
to
facts.
mr.
david
fromson
sir,
i
believe
the
board
under
their
decisions
had
been
reluctant
to
assume
that
we
should
not
have
a
(voice
overlap)
mr.
david
fromson
that's
right
sir
and
i
--
i
--
mr.
david
fromson
we
would
have
welcomed
the
opportunity
for
the
contract
also
to
assume
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
fromson
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
david
fromson
we
--
we
make
it
our
chance
belatedly
but
i
don't
think
the
court
of
claims
is
wrong.
mr.
david
fromson
no
sir.
the
hearing,
as
i
recall,
and
i
did
not
handle
the
case
at
that
time.
mr.
david
fromson
the
--
in
december
of
1959,
grace
filed
its
appeal
with
the
board
of
contract
claims,
and
in
june
of
1960,
there
was
a
decision.
the
important
thing
to
remember
in
connection
with
the
disputes
clause
and
--
is
that
it
promised,
it
promised
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
and
in
that
sense,
they
did
not
live
up
to
their
promise
even
independent
of
timeliness
and
in
that
respect,
the
clause
radically
differs
in
bianchi
clause.
now
we,
as
i've
said,
take
the
position
that
there
are
three
valid
reasons
why
this
court
should
permit
the
court
of
claims
to
retain
jurisdiction.
the
first
that
we
are
outside
of
bianchi
and
the
second
that
we
have
exhaust
this
rate
of
remedy,
and
the
third
that
there
was
an
interpretation
of
the
contract
and
therefore
a
matter
of
law.
after
the
first
point,
i
have
alluded
to
the
fact
that
we
are
not
here
dealing
with
the
standard
provision.
in
bianchi,
the
court
in
most
excellent
fashion
reviewed
the
history
of
the
court
of
claims
activity
in
this
field,
including
a
summary
of
the
wunderlich
statute
and
then
made
its
most
important
decision
affecting
government
procurement
as
reflected
in
bianchi.
just
briefly
to
again
recapitulate
the
difference
between
the
two
clauses.
in
the
standard
clause,
you
have
a
limitation
on
facts
whereas
in
the
grace
clause,
there
were
no
limitations.
in
the
standard
clause,
there
is
a
requirement
that
the
contractor
proceed
with
the
work
whereas
in
the
grace,
there
was
no
such
requirement.
we
would
deny
that
opportunity
as
the
record
will
show
and
in
the
standards
clause,
there
is
no
promise
of
an
opportunity
to
present
evidence
at
a
hearing.
whereas
in
our
case,
there
was
that
promise
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
clause.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
david
fromson
page
16
of
the
record.
mr.
david
fromson
that's
right,
sir,
page
3
of
the
brief.
and
the
sentence
i
have
eluded
too,
sir,
is
“in
connection
with
any
appeal
under
this
paragraph,
you
will
be
afforded
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
to
offer
evidence
in
support
of
your
appeal.
this
was
denied
to
grace
at
the
administrative
level.
so
there
are
serious
distinguishing
characteristics
which
in
our
judgment
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
this
may
very
well
be
unrelated
to
bianchi
and
not
within
its
strict
interpretation
or
rationale.
there
are
other
reasons
why
there
are
differences
here.
in
bianchi,
there
was
a
hearing
on
the
merits,
in
our
case,
no
hearing
on
the
merits.
in
bianchi,
you
had
a
valid
decision.
in
our
case,
what
proof
to
be
an
invalid
decision?
our
controversy
is
beyond
the
disputes
clause
whereas
bianchi
was
clearly
within
it.
the
government
has
carefully
omitted
to
mention
that
our
clause
is
not
standard
and
they
have
indifferently
assumed
that
the
board
will
accept
a
remand.
i
know
of
no
law
or
regulation
or
any
power
compelling
the
board
of
contract
appeals
to
accept
this
case
in
the
first
instance
and
secondly,
if
it
were
to,
that
it
could
not,
for
a
second
time,
claim
that
we
were
untimely
or
for
any
other
reason,
disqualify
this
contractor.
at
page
13
of
the
government's
brief,
the
government
cites
four
cases
suggesting
in
those
cases
that
remand
was
feasible
and
accomplished.
but
as
respectfully
suggested
that
an
examination
of
those
four
cases
will
reveal
that
they
are
completely
irrelevant,
they
did
not
involve
any
disputes
clause,
wunderlich
or
bianchi
but
were
on
a
general
proposition
totally
unrelated
to
the
subject
matter
at
hand.
so
before
proceeding
with
the
second
point,
may
i
again
remind
the
court
that
through
no
point
of
grace,
he
was
denied
what
was
rightfully
his
under
contract
and
it
was
the
government
who
broke
their
agreement.
i
believe
a
part
of
the
disputes
provision
is
the
requirement
that
the
government
give
a
correct
decision
or
else
suffer
the
consequences.
to
permit
the
government
to
have
made
the
error
and
then
require
us
to
return
before
the
same
person
who
committed
the
error,
i
respectfully
submit
is
most
unfair
and
even
deeper
works
a
great
injustice
to
the
defense
industry
contractor
who
all
of
us
know
have
too
many
square
corners
now
to
turn
and
who
should,
if
anything
be
given
the
opportunity
for
speedy
resolution
of
their
problems.
mr.
david
fromson
statutory
sir.
on
this
first
point,
when
we
claim
we
are
beyond
bianchi,
we
are
saying
also
sir
that
we
are
beyond
wunderlich.
our
second
point
is
that
we
have
exhausted
our
administrative
remedy
and
we
just
had
no
place
else
to
go,
but
to
the
court
of
claims
and
this
through
no
fault
of
our
own.
now
the
government
at
page
14
in
its
brief
states
the
general
proposition
that
neither
the
court
of
claims
nor
any
district
court
can
consider
these
disputes
unless
the
contractor
has
first
exhausted
its
administrative
remedies
and
we
have
no
quarrel
because
that
actually
is
the
rule.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
failure
of
the
government
to
render
a
correct
decision
and
to
give
this
case
and
to
hear
the
case
on
the
merits,
constituted
such
exhaustion.
the
government
has
not
suggested
in
its
brief
nor
does
it
cite
any
authority
as
to
what
may
happen
if
grace
is
denied
an
opportunity
before
the
board.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
i
know
of
no
rule
requiring
this
board
to
take
the
case.
as
a
practical
matter
and
as
a
matter
of
realism,
look
what
chaos
can
happen
and
occur
when
a
contracting
officer
makes
a
mistake,
and
it's
compounded
by
a
local
administrative
board
and
the
contractor
thereafter
sticks
its
remedy
in
the
court
and
it
is
later
found
that
this
were
an
error,
should
that
contractor
be
penalized
and
the
case
remanded?
this
may
happen
a
number
of
times,
not
just
once
or
isn't
the
federal
rule
that
the
government
should
just
have
one
bite
at
the
apple
and
that
we
shouldn't
attempt
to
unring
the
bell.
once
they've
made
their
decision,
should
the
innocent
contractor
suffer
therefore?
it
would
appear
to
me
that
it'd
be
quite
important,
and
again,
i
speak
on
behalf
of
an
industry
that
deserves
the
consideration
of
this
highest
court,
that
they
not
be
penalized.
the
court
of
claims
found,
the
full
court
of
claims
found
there
was
no
dissent
on
this
point
that
under
the
present
state
of
the
law,
a
contractor
may
seek
and
find
relief
from
the
error
of
either
a
contracting
officer
or
the
administrative
agency
by
appeal
to
that
court.
in
langenfelder,
in
zachry,
in
both
cases,
in
both
cases,
the
court
of
claims
held
that
the
contractor
was
relieved
and
he
need
not
pursue
any
further
futile
remedies.
we
agree
that
in
the
general
rule,
the
contractor
must
first
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
before
proceeding
with
the
court,
but
as
had
been
established
by
this
court
in
both
blair
and
holpuch,
exceptions
to
that
rule
are
pertinent.
we
believe
we
come
within
that
exception,
namely,
that
we've
exhausted
our
administrative
remedy
and
that
we
are
properly
within
the
realm
of
the
court
of
claims.
it
would
seem
just
right
to
require
a
contractor
to
revert
only
once
as
i
mentioned
earlier
to
hold
otherwise,
would
just
be
chaotic.
the
government
in
its
brief
at
page
16,
states,
speaking
of
the
board
below,
the
board
merely
dismissed
an
untimely
--
as
untimely
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
board
merely
dismissed
as
untimely
an
administrative
appeal
which
the
court
of
claims
believed
timely.
the
board's
action
was
at
most
a
prejudicial
error
not
a
denial
of
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
and
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
that
is
directly
contrary
to
the
holding
of
the
court
of
claims
for
the
full
court
determined
that
this
was
a
recognition
by
the
board
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
to
take
the
case
for
any
purpose.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
the
decisions
affecting
the
operations
of
the
board
of
contract
appeals,
once
the
appeal
period
has
expired,
i
believe
there
is
no
authority
in
anyone
to
extend
that
30-day
period.
i
do
not
know
whether
the
board
will
be
willing
to
do
that
which
under
its
prior
decisions
hasn't
found
to
be
impossible.
the
third
point
and
concluding
point
concerns
the
fact
that
the
administrative
record
before
the
court
of
claims
involves
a
question
of
law
thereby
permitting
said
court
to
retain
general
jurisdiction
and
to
resolve
de
novo,
all
or
related
factual
issues.
as
the
record
reveals,
grace
was
perfectly
willing
to
continue
with
its
performance
and
to
construct
the
required
buildings,
but
was
denied
that
opportunity
because
in
the
fact,
two
contrary
at
wage
administrations
were
issued
and
each
of
them
changed
the
scope
of
the
work
as
set
forth
in
the
prior
invitation
for
bid
and
the
interpretation
of
these
matters
properly
was
determined
by
the
court
of
claims
to
be
interpretations
involving
or
conclusion
--
involving
conclusions
of
law.
having
so
determined
it,
they
may
properly
retain
and
resolve
all
factual
issues.
it
would
appear
only
just
proper
and
fair
that
grace
not
require
a
fragmentation
of
its
remedy
because
it
is
well
established
that
certain
of
the
issues
might
very
well
require
resolution
in
the
court
of
claims
and
on
this
point,
i
believe
the
full
court
below
was
unanimous
and
the
government
concedes.
since
the
board
of
contract
appeals,
the
board
of
contract
appeals
will
not
resolve
matters
touching
upon
wage
determinations
and
similar
matters.
mr.
david
fromson
sir,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
fromson
sir,
if
i
may
read
as
i
understand
their
point
at
page
17
in
their
brief
and
it
is
also
true
that
the
administrative
board
like
the
court
of
claims
itself
will
not
review
or
construe
the
wage
determinations
of
the
secretary
of
labor.
for
the
foregoing
reasons,
sir,
namely
because
of
the
unique
factual
pattern
in
this
case,
we
are
without
and
beyond
and
outside
of
the
scriptures
of
the
bianchi
decision.
secondly,
having
exhausted
our
administrative
remedy,
we
are
entitled
to
speedy
relief
within
the
court
of
claims.
and
thirdly,
since
the
ultimate
issue
involved
the
question
of
law,
this
court
should
not
impose
the
hardship
of
fragmentation
of
remedy.
it
should
not
delimit
the
properly
acquired
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims.
for
these
reasons,
we
respectfully
request
confirmation
and
concurrence
of
the
powers
here
to
for
assume
by
the
court
to
hear
and
determine
all
matters
before
it.
thank
you.
