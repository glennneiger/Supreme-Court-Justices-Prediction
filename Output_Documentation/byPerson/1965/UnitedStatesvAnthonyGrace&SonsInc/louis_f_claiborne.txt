mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
and
case
that
follows
come
here
from
the
court
of
claims.
they
both
involve
an
application
of
this
court's
decision
three
terms
ago
in
bianchi
versus
united
states.
in
that
case,
the
basic
thrust
of
that
decision
was
that
the
determination
of
disputes
arising
out
of
government
contract
is
primarily
for
the
administrative
boards
from
the
various
procuring
agencies
subject
only
to
the
same
limited
judicial
review
as
is
appropriate
in
other
cases.
the
court
of
claims,
it
seems
to
us,
has
been
knowing
a
way
at
that
rule
ever
since
it
was
enacted
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
we
ask
the
court
to
take
these
cases.
the
precise
issue
in
my
case
is
a
very
narrow
one.
it
is
whether
factual
issues
arising
under
a
government
procurement
contract
or
a
construction
contract
in
this
case
which
concededly
should
have
been
resolved
administratively,
maybe
decided
in
the
first
instance
by
the
court
of
claims
merely
because
the
administrative
board
believing
that
the
appeal
to
it
was
untimely,
did
not
reach
those
issues.
the
case
arises
under
the
following
facts.
back
in
august
of
1958,
the
air
force
issued
invitation
for
bids
to
construct
military
housing
in
air
force
base
in
the
maine.
the
successful
bidder
was
the
respondent,
anthony
grace
&
sons.
under
the
--
they
were
issued
a
letter
of
acceptability
which
is
the
formal
way
in
which
the
agreement
between
the
parties
was
made.
under
the
agreement
then
entered
into,
it
was
provided
that
wage
determinations
would
be
made
by
the
secretary
of
labor
and
this
construction
was
to
be
governed
by
the
davis-becon
act
because
the
wage
determination
though
they're
included
in
the
documents
might
not
be
up
to
date,
it
was
provided
that
new
determinations
would
be
sought
by
the
contractor
from
the
secretary
of
labor
and
that
if
there
was
a
substantial
variance
in
the
new
wage
determination,
an
appropriate
adjustment
in
the
contract
price
would
be
made.
it's
also
provided
that
the
contractor
make
a
deposit
of
$25,000
together
with
the
[inaudible]
which
respondent
did
and
that,
he
should
be
ready
to
set
a
closing
date
that
is
to
enter
into
the
formal
construction
contract
at
a
time
specified.
it
was
further
provided
pursuant
to
what
we
label
a
disputes
clause
that
in
the
event,
the
contractor
defaulted
in
his
obligations
and
failed
to
close,
the
government
would
be
entitled
to
retain
the
$25,000
deposit
and
likewise
recover
actual
damages
over
and
above
that
amount
he
paid,
and
that
this
matter
should
be
determined
in
the
first
instance
by
the
contracting
officer
and
then
by
the
administrative
board
of
the
agency
involved,
in
this
case
the
air
force
which
jointly
with
the
other
services
has
what
is
known
as
the
armed
services
board
of
contract
appeals.
after
the
new
wage
determinations
were
made
by
the
secretary
of
labor
which
did
include
an
increase
in
wage
rates
for
some
of
the
construction
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
labor
involved
in
a
construction.
it
was
raised
to
the
position
that
there
was
not
only
a
change
in
rates,
but
also
a
change
in
the
area
to
which
these
higher
rates
were
applicable.
that
disagreement
was
aired
between
the
parties
in
correspondence
to
some
time.
ultimately,
the
air
force
contracting
officer
took
the
position
that
there
had
not
been
such
a
variance
in
the
area
to
which
the
new
higher
rates
were
applicable
and
that
accordingly
the
contractor
was
not
entitled
to
an
increase
in
the
contract
price
on
that
account.
he
therefore
demanded
grace
that
it
comply
with
the
closing
date
and
enter
into
the
contract.
grace
did
not
do
so
whereupon
the
contracting
officer
notified
grace
that
the
agreement
was
canceled.
20
days
later,
the
contracting
officer
in
response
to
a
letter
from
grace
asking
for
a
return
of
its
deposit,
informed
grace
that
the
deposit
was
forfeit
since
the
failure
--
since
the
default
was
to
be
laid
at
the
door
of
grace.
at
this
point,
grace
appealed
to
the
board
of
contract
appeals,
seeking
a
return
of
its
deposit.
the
board,
however,
viewed
the
appeal
as
untimely.
we
needn't
discuss
the
reasons
for
that
decision
because
it
is
no
longer
here.
upon
the
ruling
of
the
board
of
contract
appeals,
grace
then
sued
out
its
claim
in
the
court
of
claims.
the
court
of
claims
held
that
the
appeal
was
timely,
that
the
board
should
have
had
the
case
on
merits,
that
the
government's
motion
for
summary
judgment
predicated
on
the
theory
that
in
no
event
was
the
default
justified
even
if
the
adjustment
in
the
bid
price
might
have
been
erroneously
denied,
was
at
least
tentatively
denied
and
the
court
of
claims
remanded
the
case
to
its
trial
commissioner,
for
trail.
now,
it's
maybe
helpful
to
isolate
the
questions
as
they
were
presented
to
the
court
of
claims
even
though
those
questions
were
not
here.
the
government's
first
position
was
that
grace's
claim
in
the
court
was
barred
because
it
did
fail
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
in
that
it
had
not
timely
appealed
to
the
board
of
contract
appeals.
as
i
have
said,
that
position
of
the
government
was
flatly
rejected
by
the
court
of
claims
and
we
do
not
challenge
the
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
on
that
point.
the
government's
second
position
was
that
the
claim
stated
no
cause
of
action
on
which
relief
could
be
granted
because
in
the
circumstances,
even
if
the
failure
to
allow
an
increased
price
was
unjustified,
nevertheless
grace's
proper
recourse
was
to
go
to
the
board
not
to
default
as
it
did.
again,
the
court
of
claims
at
least
tentatively
moved
against
the
government
on
this
issue
to
deny
the
government's
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
was
in
part
predicated
on
that
theory
and
again
we
did
not
petition
from
that
decision
of
the
court
of
claims
and
therefore
do
not
challenge
it
here.
now
finally,
and
this
is
the
only
issue
that
is
still
in
the
case
as
it
appears
here.
again,
this
issue
is
not
a
resolution
by
this
court
is
whether
the
contractor
was
in
fact
justified,
the
assumption
that
there
might
some
justifications,
in
defaulting
rather
than
awaiting
a
resolution
of
his
dispute
about
whether
or
not,
he
was
entitled
to
an
increased
price
in
light
of
the
new
determinations
of
wages
by
the
secretary
of
labor.
because
the
court
of
claims
impliedly
ruled
at
least
that
this
question
was
an
open
one
and
because
it
ruled
clearly
that
the
question
should
be
determined
in
light
of
the
underlying
facts
that
a
factual
record
should
be
made
before
the
question
would
be
decided.
it
held
that
a
trial
was
necessary.
now
the
resolution
of
that
issue
will
determine
whether
the
contractor
was
excused
from
the
normal
penalty
of
default
which
is
forfeiture
of
this
deposit
and
conceivably
whether
the
government's
action
was
so
unwarranted
to
entitle
him
to
additional
damages.
now
the
issue
in
this
court,
as
i've
said,
does
not
relate
to
the
denial
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
we
did
not
petition
on
that
issue.
we
accept
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
claims
that
there
are
factual
issues
that
must
be
determined
somewhere,
that
a
factual
record
must
be
made
before
the
ultimate
legal
issue
is
decided.
our
only
quarrel
is
with
respect
to
where
that
factual
finding
should
be
made,
where
the
record
should
be
made
in
the
first
instance.
we
say
that
it
must
be
made
before
the
administrative
board
and
not
in
the
court
itself.
now
it
seems
to
us
that
the
bianchi
case
squarely
controls
this
question.
the
thrust
of
that
decision
is
clearly
that
factual
disputes
arising
out
of
a
contract
of
this
kind
should,
in
the
first
instance,
be
resolved
administratively.
the
only
question
here
is
whether
the
rule
is
any
different
because
the
board
had
once
erroneously
refused
to
entertain
the
dispute.
now
again
bianchi,
it
seems
to
us,
answers
that
question.
the
court
said
in
that
case
that
if
the
administrative
record
is
inadequate
or
if
the
board
has
committed
some
error,
still
the
court
should
stay
its
hand,
correct
the
error,
and
while
it
had
no
power
to
remand,
it
should
stay
the
proceedings
in
the
court
awaiting
a
correction
of
that
error
by
the
board
or
a
completion
of
the
record
in
further
board
proceedings.
that
rule
it
seems
to
us
is
fully
appropriate
in
this
case.
it's
important
to
stress
i
think
that
the
board
here
has
not
refused
to
decide
the
underlying
dispute
because
it
thought
it
lacked
jurisdiction
to
do
so.
it's
simply
erroneously
thought
the
appeal
was
untimely
and
for
that
reason
and
that
reason
alone,
it
did
not
resolved
it.
accordingly,
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
will
not
resolve
the
dispute
if
given
an
opportunity
to
do
so.
indeed,
the
board's
opinion
gives
a
rather
clear
indication
in
that
direction.
it
says
with
apparent
approval
and
i'm
reading
from
page
36
of
the
record,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
"the
parties
are
in
complete
agreement
that
it
was
and
is
their
mutual
interpretation
that
in
the
event
of
a
timely
appeal
--
in
the
event
a
timely
appeal
is
taken
thereunder,
the
disputes
paragraph'
of
the
letter
of
acceptability
confers
jurisdiction
on
the
board
to
review
a
decision
relating
to
cancellation
of
commitments,
withholding
of
bid
security,
and
itemization
and
determination
of
actual
damages."
in
light
of
that,
there
is
certainly
no
reason
to
suppose,
the
board
will
fail
to
determine
the
controversy
if
given
the
chance
to
do
so.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
under
the
bianchi
decision
itself,
there
is
a
suggestion
that
the
contractor's
remedy
is
to
obtain
a
default
judgment.
however,
we
cannot
suppose
the
government
agency
would
put
itself
in
the
position
of
forbidding
the
government
to
that
penalty
by
refusing
to
adjudicate
the
contrary.
notice
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
fortas,
bianchi
began
on
the
premise
of
the
earlier
decisions
in
this
court
which
very
clearly
required
the
parties
when
they
had
agreed
to
do
so
through
a
disputes
clause
that
these
parties
did
to
first
exhaust
their
administrative
remedies.
that
much
was
taken
as
given,
i
think,
in
the
bianchi
decision.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
only
question
there
was
whether
having
exhausted
the
administrative
remedies,
the
contractor
was
entitled
to
a
trial
de
novo
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
fortas,
answer
the
question
in
this
way.
the
court
of
claims
in
its
decision
here
seem
to
find
three
basis
for
escaping
the
rule
of
bianchi,
escaping
the
rule
that
normally
the
decision
that
factual
disputes
is
in
the
first
instance
for
the
administrative
board
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
sorry.
the
first
was
the
self-evident
proposition
that
having
in
one
sense
exhausted
its
administrative
remedy
because
it
found
the
door
to
the
board
closed
by
the
ruling
that
the
appeal
was
untimely.
of
course,
the
contractor
was
entitled
at
that
point
to
come
into
court,
but
it
doesn't
fall
off
from
that.
the
court
having
once
corrected
the
error
held
that
the
appeal
was
timely
should
then
proceed
ahead
to
decide
the
merits
of
a
controversy.
that
is
not
the
normal
rule
in
reviewing
courts
when
they
are
faced
with
the
administrative
decisions
which
either
are
incomplete
in
that
the
findings
are
insufficient
or
which
because
of
an
erroneous
ruling
as
a
matter
of
law
never
reached
the
issues
which
the
court
finds
relevant.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
again,
the
bianchi
decision
i
think
answers
that
question.
the
argument
was
there
made
that
because
the
court
of
claims
was
not
in
the
technical
sense
a
reviewing
court
and
furthermore
because
it,
and
the
district
courts
some
cases
involving
claims
of
under
$10,000
and
trial
courts
did
not
suffer
the
same
disadvantage
as
courts
of
appeal
who
more
commonly
have
the
function
of
reviewing
administrative
orders.
but
for
these
reasons,
the
court
of
claims
should
not
be
treated
as
a
mere
reviewing
court.
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
bianchi
recognizes
and
rejects
both
of
those
suggestions
pointing
out
that
there
are
cases
where
trial
courts
do
have
this
reviewing
function
and
pointing
out
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
wunderlich
act
was
intended
to
put
the
court
of
claims
with
respect
to
these
type
of
cases
in
precisely
the
same
position
as
the
court
of
appeal
on
review
of
a
normal
--
of
another
kind
of
administrative
decision.
so
that,
i
think
that
the
bianchi
decision
adverted
and
resolved
that
question
whether
the
court
of
claims
may
be
viewed
as
any
other
reviewing
courts.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
maybe,
your
honor.
i'm
not
aware
of
it,
but
i
might
not
be
aware
of
it.
finally,
the
court
of
claims
in
the
decision
below
suggests
a
further
reason
why
in
these
circumstances
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
remand
the
case
to
the
board
and
that
is
because
of
the
delays
inherent
in
a
remand.
it
reads
this
court's
opinion
in
bianchi
as
stating
that
speed
of
adjudication
is
the
central
consideration.
now
there
are
really
two
answers
to
that
suggestion.
the
first
is
that
there
is
a
remand
in
any
event
when
the
court
remands
the
case
to
its
trial
commissioner
although
it
is
in
one
sense
within
the
same
court,
there
are
delays
attendant
in
that
procedure
and
as
our
brief
attempts
to
show,
those
delays
maybe
greater
or
at
least
as
great
as
the
delays
that
might
be
involved
if
the
case
was
sent
back
to
the
board.
but
in
any
event,
this
court's
decision
in
bianchi
did
not
say
that
speed
was
a
virtue
at
all
costs.
they
were
and
or
other
reasons
underlying
the
bianchi
rule
which
lets
the
administrative
boards
decide
factual
issues
arising
under
government
contracts
to
be
decided
administratively
in
the
first
instance
rather
than
judicially.
it
would
be
--
it
would
seem
unnecessary
to
rehearse
all
those
considerations
here,
but
it's
worth
mentioning
three
of
them.
one
is
that
the
parties
themselves
have
agreed
to
have
these
matters
resolved
within
the
agency.
and
the
proper
respect
for
that
agreement,
for
that
stipulation
of
the
parties
otherwise
that
in
all
permissible
circumstances,
the
decision
be
at
the
administrative
level.
the
second
is
that
these
boards
do
have
a
special
familiarity,
a
special
competence,
one
might
even
say
an
expertise
in
these
matters.
and
for
that
reason,
it's
appropriate
that
whenever
possible,
they
be
permitted
in
the
first
instance
to
decide
especially
the
factual
questions
involved.
and
finally,
the
boards
of
these
agencies,
in
one
sense
the
agencies
themselves,
should
be
afforded
an
opportunity
to
correct
the
errors
of
their
subordinates.
that
is
certainly
a
healthy
policy.
it
confines
in
some
cases
the
matters
to
the
administrative
level
and
spares
needless
work
for
the
courts.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
to
the
board
of
contract
appeals.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
no
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
there
are
only
two
at
the
administrative
level
that
the
contracting
officer
who
simply
makes
a
decision
after
entertaining
the
positions
of
the
parties
but
not
necessarily
with
any
hearing
certainly
no
formal
hearing
of
any
kind
from
his
decision
adverse
to
the
contractor.
the
contractor
may
appeal
and
there
is,
in
most
agencies,
a
rather
formal
proceeding
provided
for
before
what
is
known
as
the
board
of
contract
appeals.
in
this
instance,
it's
the
armed
services
board
of
contract
appeals
which
serves
all
three
of
the
military
establishments
and
it
is
that
agency,
that
board,
which
would,
if
the
court
stayed
its
hand,
reconsider.
it
is
the
board
which
made
the
error
of
finding
the
appeal
untimely.
it
has
now
been
told
that
the
appeal
was
timely
that
it
should
have
entertained
it
and
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
it
will
do
so
as
it
indicated
in
its
own
opinion.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
and
that
--
that
is
a
suggestion
made
in
the
bianchi
opinion
itself.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
court
of
claims
has
no
technical
power
to
remand
the
case
and
therefore
this
is
the
way
in
which
it
goes
about
remanding.
and
of
course
it's
a
procedure
that's
familiar
in
the
interstate
commerce
area
when
there
is
a
question
of
--
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
icc,
the
court
--
the
district
court
is
directed
to
stay
its
hand
pending
this
administrative
decision.
for
these
reasons
as
we
say,
we
believe
that
the
court
of
claims
should
have
stayed
its
hand
and
that
insofar
as
the
judgment
below,
remand
the
case
of
the
trial
commissioner
rather
than
awaiting
further
proceedings,
timely
proceedings,
in
the
board
of
contract
appeals,
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we'll
waive
rebuttal,
your
honor.
