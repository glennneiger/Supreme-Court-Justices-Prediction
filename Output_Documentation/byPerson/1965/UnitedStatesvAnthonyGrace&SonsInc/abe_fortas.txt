justice
abe
fortas
mr.
claiborne,
i
suppose
one
theoretical
question
or
theory
is
whether
this
is
a
matter
of
the
bianchi
is
based
on
the
idea
that
one
must
exhaust
the
administrative
remedy
by
having
a
trial
of
having
the
evidence
to
use
there
and
then
the
appellate
courts
or
the
reviewing
courts
will
review
of
it
will
confine
themselves
to
that
record
or
whether
there's
some
other
theory
underlying
bianchi.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
here
there
was,
in
the
sense
there
was
an
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
by
--
and
that's
the
bothersome
feature
of
this
case
to
me
analytically,
that
is
to
say
that
the
contractor
did
go
through
the
procedures
and
the
door
was
closed
to
him
and
everything
else
that
he
could
do
and
he
emerged
from
that
with
zero,
he
did
not
emerge
from
that
administrative
record
upon
which
the
court
could
act
and
what
happens
thereafter
to
me
is
analytically
and
theoretically
difficult.
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
error.
what
you're
--
what
you're
in
effect
proposing
and
maybe
this
is
right,
i
don't
know,
is
that
ruling
under
the
board
of
contract
appeals
was
under
a
disputes
clause
in
the
contract,
which
can
affect
jurisdiction
or
whatever
that
means
in
these
circumstances
is
vested
in
that
board
because
--
really
because
of
the
disputes
clause.
would
that
be
treated
as
if
it
were
a
ruling
of
an
administrative
agency
of
the
usual
kind?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
so?
justice
abe
fortas
where
does
this
go?
suppose
the
agency
wants
to
adhere
that
those
--
that
the
court
of
claims
are
remanding
on
--
remand
from
this
court
or
otherwise
decides
that
nothing
should
be
heard
in
the
first
instance
by
the
administrative
agency.
where
does
it
go?
where
this
case
go
then,
in
the
board
of
contract
appeals
or
to
the
contracting
officer
or
where?
justice
abe
fortas
then
go
back
any
further
than
that?
justice
abe
fortas
does
board
of
contract
appeals
conduct
the
hearing
or
is
it
the
board
just
below
that
that
conducted
it?
justice
abe
fortas
if
i
correctly
understood
you,
you
suggested
that
the
court
of
claims
should
retain
jurisdiction
across
which
could
merely
stay
its
hand
and
tell
a
record
is
made
--
is
that
your
thought
about
it?
justice
abe
fortas
what
page
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
telling
us
that
the
government
agrees
if
there
are
issues
of
law
that
would
have
to
be
settled
here
by
the
court
of
claims?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
telling
us
that
the
government
agrees
that
there
are
issues
of
law
and
have
to
be
settled
by
the
court
of
claims
ultimately?
