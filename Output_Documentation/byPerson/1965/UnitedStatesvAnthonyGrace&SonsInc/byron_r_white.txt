justice
byron

white
well
i
certainly
agree
with
you
but
reading
it,
you
wouldn't
think
it
was
limited
to
factual
determinations
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
the
breaches
of
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
why
wouldn't
the
--
why
wouldn't
the
contracting
officer
have
power
to
face
up
to
claims
of
breach
of
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
disputes
clause,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
isn't
one
of
them.
this
isn't
the
standards
disputes
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
he's
going
to
get
the
chance
if
the
court
of
claims
is
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
dissent
in
the
court
of
claims
is
right,
you'll
get
your
chance.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
where
--
where
did
you
get
along
faster
and
more
quickly,
the
court
of
claims
or
before
the
contracting
officer?
(voice
overlap)
how
long
did
it
take
to
get
through
the
court
of
claims,
five
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
when
the
time
you
filed
your
case
in
the
court
of
claims
until
you
got
out,
how
long
was
it?
it's
quite
a
while
anyway.
