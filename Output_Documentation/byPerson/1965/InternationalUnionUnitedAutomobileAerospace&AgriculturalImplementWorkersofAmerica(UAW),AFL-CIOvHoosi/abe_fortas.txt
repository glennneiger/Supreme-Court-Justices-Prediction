justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
showing
as
to
the
reason
for
the
delay
of
what
you
call
11
months
--
i
mean
the
decision
of
the
indiana
appellate
court
in
filing
of
federal
action.
now,
smith
came
down
on
december
10,
1962.
justice
abe
fortas
that
was
--
that
four
months
before
the
indiana
appellate
court
decided
the
present
case
and
then
after
the
indiana
appellate
court
decided
the
present
case.
there
was
elapsed
of
about
11
months
according
to
your
brief,
am
i
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
there
anything
in
the
--
before
us
to
show
why
there
was
that
delay
in
the
circumstances
of
a
claim
that
at
the
very
least
was
getting
well
aged?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
saying
sir
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
not
in
effect?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
not
contesting
the
point,
if
i
correctly
understand
you.
you're
not
contesting
the
point
that
their
claim,
approximate
amount
of
$40,000,
that
part
of
their
claim
is
bottomed
on
the
written
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
would
be
true
in
every
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
not
in
--
you're
not
suggesting
there's
anything
different
with
respect
to
the
$40,000
here
than
it
would
be
in
any
other
case
where
an
employee
sues,
the
union
sues
on
his
behalf
under
a
collective
bargaining
contract.
and
do
i
correctly
understand
you?
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
indiana
court
so
rule
in
this
case?
or
has
that
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
didn't
--
does
your
brief
contain
any
references
to
indiana
decisions
on
this
point?
justice
abe
fortas
you
know
what
--
just
don't
take
your
time
like
this,
(voice
