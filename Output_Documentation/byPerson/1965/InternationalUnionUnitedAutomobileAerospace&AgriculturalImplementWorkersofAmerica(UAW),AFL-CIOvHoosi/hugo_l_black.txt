justice

suppose
the
federal
government
has
created
a
cause
of
action,
the
state
has
none
like
it
and
there
was
no
statute
of
limitation
fixed,
what
would
you
say
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
created
a
cause
of
action,
a
civil
cause
of
action?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
no
action
of
that
kind
in
a
state
so
it
had
no
statute
of
limitations
for
that
kind
of
action?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
state
cause
of
action
--
it's
like
this
state
cause
of
action
from
which
you
want
to
borrow
that
statute
of
limitations.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
indiana
have
one
of
this
kind?
a
cause
of
action
for
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
penalty?
justice

l.
black
penalty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
part
of
the
complaint
in
which
he's
relying
on
indiana
statute,
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
paragraph
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
paragraph
10
of
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
it
controversy
over
that
particular
one
as
to
what
statute
of
limitations
applies?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
so
far
as
paragraph
10
is
concerned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
court
should
think
you
were
wrong
and
the
federal
law
does
apply
--
should
apply,
what
would
you
suggest
as
to
the
formulation
of
the
federal
statute
of
limitations?
could
there
be
none
and
just
be
left
open?
or
that'd
be
a
general
rule
of
(inaudible)
or
that
they
try
to
suggest
to
fix
the
definite
time
of
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
(voice
overlap)
--
i
understood
you
really
to
be
saying
that
the
court
shouldn't
be
trying
to
fix
the
different
sides
between
different
terms
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
sounded
pretty
logical
to
me.
if
it
doesn't
do
that
what
would
you
say?
if
it
doesn't
try
to
fix
a
certain
number
of
years
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
--
to
absolutely
open
as
though
there
were
none?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
that
there'd
be
some
kind
of
federal
rule
elected?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
but
suppose
it
didn't
work
--
couldn't
--
it
wouldn't
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
