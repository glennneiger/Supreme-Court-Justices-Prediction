mr.
harry
p.
dees
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
first
like
to
address
myself
to
the
jurisdictional
questions
that
were
raised
in
the
courts
below
briefly.
as
it's
been
indicated
at
the
time
this
litigation
arose
and
prior
to
the
smith
case
if
it
did
overrule
westinghouse
clearly,
this
case
could
not
have
been
maintained
in
the
federal
court.
the
facts
are
almost
identical
in
which
the
union
was
seeking
to
recover
vacation
pay
and
even
further
in
this
case
they're
seeking
to
recover
statutory
penalties
for
double
damages
and
attorney
fees
which
of
course
would
be
allowed
but
only
under
the
indiana
state
law.
so,
we
thought
there
is
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
or
not
smith
had
effectively
overruled
westinghouse
in
this
particular
type
of
case.
so
we
raised
the
point,
and
i'm
sure
that
i'm
not
going
to
deliver
it
because
you
gentlemen
are
--
i'm
sure
familiar
with
both
cases
but
we
did
think
that
when
--
that
the
smith
case
did
not
go
to
the
extent
of
staying
that
in
a
case
such
as
these
where
the
union
itself
seeks
to
recover
purely
personal
rights
for
the
employees.
there's
no
relief
sought
in
these
case
or
behalf
of
union
as
such
at
all.
and
finding
out
that
under
indiana
law
a
claim
for
statutory
penalties
under
this
case
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
mckinney
versus
standard
oil,
holds
that
claim
for
statutory
penalties
is
not
even
assignable.
only
the
employee
himself
can
recover
that
right.
well,
we
think
--
we
thought
that
where
a
union
here
is
trying
to
recover
those
particular
type
of
recoveries
on
behalf
of
this
employees
that
we
questioned
whether
smith
did
go
so
far
as
to
overrule
westinghouse
in
that
respect.
for
that
reason,
we
raised
the
question
below
and
frankly
the
district
court
had
some
difficulty
with
that
problem
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
didn't
discuss
it
very
much
except
that
say
that
they
thought
it
was
--
this
case
did
not
conflict
with
those
principles.
our
second
point
that
we
have
raised
in
our
jurisdictional
question
and
i
want
to
mention
that
just
briefly
and
that
is
that
we
relied
upon
republic
versus
maddox
which
is
on
the
proposition
that
it
--
there
was
no
grievance
filed
in
this
case,
although,
the
contract
required
that
the
court
would
not
have
a
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
suit.
now,
their
reply
brief
which
was
just
served
on
us
monday,
and
i'd
like
to
take
this
point
to
answer
one
or
two
things
in
this
reply
brief
that
i
think
are
outside
of
the
records
and
are
incorrect
and
in
which
the
company
is
going
to
deny
and
i
think
these
points
out
the
danger
of
permitting
a
case
that
was
not
presented
to
the
case
--
the
courts
below.
it's
not
the
record
in
this
case
to
be
first
tried
in
this
court
for
the
first
time.
i'm
referring
of
course
to
the
state
court
case
that
was
not
in
the
record,
was
not
discussed
at
all
in
the
briefs
before
the
district
court
or
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
but
in
the
first
time,
we
have
that
--
that
this
court
has
the
case
on
an
appendix
by
the
petitioner.
and
now
in
a
reply
brief,
we're
going
to
get
in
a
controversy
of
facts
because
they
(inaudible)
in
this
reply
brief.
and
this
is
obviously
to
get
around
this
tolling
proposition
and
they
admitted
that
they
didn't
bring
their
first
action
till
eight
months
after
the
cause
of
action
arose.
they
omit
that
two
places
in
their
brief
in
which
they
say
at
the
page
3
of
their
brief,
in
giving
you
the
facts
they
say
this,
that
on
jan
--
jan
--
at
page
3
on
june
the
1st,
1953,
the
company
terminated
the
employment
of
more
than
a
hundred
workers
whose
deployment
and
vacation
pay
were
controlled
by
the
union
company
agreement
of
1955
but
the
company
did
not
at
that
time
or
thereafter
pay
to
the
terminated
employees
their
accumulated
vacation
pay.
then
they
say,
“eight
months
after
this
refusal
to
honor
the
agreement
on
february
21,
1958,
the
union
of
companies
filed
a
suite.”
now
in
their
reply
brief
they
say,
“the
company
finally
ceased
evansville
production
operations
covered
by
the
contract
with
the
union
on
june
the
28th,
1957.
its
workforce
was
thereupon
disbanded
and
operating
officials
left
the
state.
at
a
meeting
on
june
the
25th,
1925,
the
company
assured
you
that
it
would
grant
the
vacation
pay
and
would
issue
checks
in
the
following
january.”
however,
when
a
group
of
employees
went
to
the
premises
on
january
the
2nd,
they
were
informed
that
the
company
was
not
in
operation
and
no
payment
would
be
made.
thus,
when
the
company
made
--
manifest
its
violation
of
contract
in
january
and
had
ceased
its
operations
for
six
month
the
suit
was
brought
in
february.
now
that
we
deny
that
that
statement
was
ever
made.
that's
going
outside
the
record
again
and
i
wanted
your
honors
to
know
our
position
in
this
case.
and
we
think
it's
brought
in
there
and
it's
a
direct
conflict
with
what
is
previously
alleged
that
the
cause
of
action
arose
in
june
and
they
admit
they
didn't
--
they
waited
eight
months
after
the
cause
of
action
arose.
now,
they're
trying
to
get
the
cause
of
action
arose
about
a
month
before
the
recent
file.
we
say
that's
not
correct.
also,
i
might
point
out
that
they
don't
point
out
in
the
brief,
they've
make
a
point
that
a
receivership
was
asked
for
this
company
and
a
footnote
in
the
reply
brief.
but
they
conveniently
omit
at
the
trial
court
--
denied
the
application
for
a
receivership
to
this
company
shortly
after
the
case
was
filed.
i
want
to
just
make
those
two
points
and
still
argue
that
on
--
under
the
theory
of
matters
there's
a
serious
jurisdiction
of
question
here
whether
this
court
can
recover.
now,
they
say,
“we
went
outside
of
the
record”,
that's
another
charge
i'd
like
to
repute.they
say,
“we
are
bringing
it
something
in
and
out
of
the
record.”
the
record
shows
that
--
and
this
is
what
we
said
in
our
brief,
“we
say
no
reference
in
the
--
is
in
the
record
that
appellant
--
petitioner
in
this
case
filed
a
grievance.”
we
didn't
go
outside
the
record.
we
said
it
in
this
case,
"the
record
doesn't
show
and
the
complaint
does
allege
of
performance
of
a
condition
preceding
or
that
a
grievance
was
filed."
so
we
think
that
on
that
question,
we
have
a
valid
jurisdictional
question
here
that
should
be
determined.
now,
i'm
getting
to
this
question
and
i
suppose
this
is
the
main
issue
in
this
case,
is
to
whether
or
not
this
court
should
adopt
standards
--
judicially
adopt
the
statute
of
limitations.
we
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
petitioner
is
really
asking
this
court
to
assume
some
terrific
burdens
here.
they
not
only
want
you
to
adopt,
judicially
adopt
statutes
of
limitations
for
these
national
labor
relations
cases,
they
want
you
to
go
on
the
various
categories
and
pick
out
the
different
types
of
action
and
adopt
different
formulations
as
to
the
standard
there.
further,
they
want
you
to
adopt
a
formulation
standard
under
the
theory
of
the
burnett
case
that
will
toll
the
statutes
in
this
case
so
they
can
effectively
get
in
court
under
--
whatever
theory
that
your
honors
adopt.
and
i
submit
that
it's
--
asking
quite
a
burden
to
this
court.
i
ask
you
to
go
into
that
in
detail.
now
getting
back
to
this
main
question,
that
if
the
state
--
whether
the
state
statute
of
limitations
should
be
applied
in
this
case.
your
honors,
of
course
your
familiar
with
the
well-established
rule.
its
been
many
times
decided
in
this
case
--
court
that
where
the
federal
statute
does
not
contain
a
limitation
of
time
limitation
that
historically
you
follow
the
state
rules
but
--
of
the
limitations.
now,
that's
based
on
the
rules
of
decision.
the
early
case,
it
was
first
decided
in
1830
in
mccluny
versus
silliman
but
the
really
the
keystone
case,
i
think,
was
the
campbell
versus
haverhill
and
that
was
a
patent
case
in
1894.
and
i
just
like
to
quote
one
thing
from
judge
brown
who
decided
that
case
said
at
page
618,
“the
truth
is
that
statute
of
limitations
affect
the
remedy
only
and
do
not
impair
the
right
and
that
the
settle
policy
of
congress
has
been
to
permit
rights
created
by
its
statutes
to
be
enforced
in
the
manner
and
subject
to
the
limitations
prescribed
by
the
laws
of
the
several
states."
now,
judge
brown
gave
some
reasons
for
that
which
i
think
are
applicable
here
and
which
i
like
to
call
your
honors'
attention.
it
would
be
an
anomaly
it
said,
for
congress
to
create
a
right
without
a
limitation
and
intended
no
limitations
should
apply.
in
other
words
he
says,
“congress
wouldn't
pass
a
law,
not
put
a
limitation
and
expect
that
it
would
never
--
that
the
statute
would
never
be
barred.”
so
therefore,
congress
indented
that
it
--
they
didn't
put
something
in
the
act
that
the
state
law
would
apply.
he
also
pointed
out
that
it
would
be
discriminatory
if
for
the
same
set
of
facts
under
a
state
law
that
the
head
of
state
statute
of
limitations
would
apply
to
a
litigant
but
if
it
was
brought
under
a
federal
law
for
the
same
set
of
facts,
there'd
be
no
limitation
that
would
apply
to
the
federal
law.
so
they
say,
“that
would
be
discriminatory”
and
that's
another
reason
congress
did
not
intend
for
that
to
happen
but
that
permitted
the
courts
to
look
for
the
state
law.
now,
in
this
case,
congress
obviously
has
--
is
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
in
301
actions,
303
action,
they
didn't
put
a
statute
of
limitations.
in
many
of
this
other
federal
acts
that
did
not
have
statute
of
limitations
such
as
the
patent
act,
the
antitrust
act,
congress
did
go
back
later
on
and
put
in
a
statute
of
limitations.
it
took
congress
40
years
to
get
around
in
putting
the
statute
of
limitations
in
the
antitrust
laws
but
they
finally
did
so.
but
during
that
interim,
federal
courts
seemed
to
get
along
alright
applying
the
state
statute
of
limitations
and
i'm
sure
they'll
continue
to
do
that
in
these
cases.
and
now,
why
would
you
use
the
statute
of
limitations?
we
say
it's
the
local
contexts
that
were
really
covered.
now
here
in
this
case,
the
plant
is
in
indiana,
the
employees
are
in
indiana,
the
logical
place
that
they
had
bring
the
suit
in
federal
court
would
be
in
indiana.
in
the
cope
(inaudible)
--
cope-anderson
case
as
justice
black
said
in
that
case,
“moreover,
limitations
are
federally
created
rights
to
sue
--
to
have
--
similarly
been
construed
to
be
governed
by
limitation
laws
of
the
state
where
the
crucial
culmination
of
events
transpired.
here
the
crucial
common
--
basing
--
involved
events
transpired
in
indiana,
the
plant
is
there,
the
employees
are
there.
in
any
of
these
labor
cases
where
they
talked
about
a
need
for
a
national
uniformity,
the
plants
where
this
men
worked,
that's
where
they're
going
to
bring
the
action.
and
if
they
should
bring
it
to
some
other
state,
no
doubt
the
federal
court
might
send
it
back
to
the
local
scene
were
the
breach
occurred.
so
we
say
that
there
is
no
reason
why
this
court
should
abandon
its
well
established
law
that
the
state
laws
applied
where
the
federal
courts
do
not
contain
the
limitation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
very
question
has
been
raised
in
several
--
in
two
cases
involving
the
303
in
united
mine
workers
versus
meadowcreek
coal,
a
sixth
circuit
case
and
the
international
operating
union
versus
fischbach
and
moore,
the
key
--
that
question
was
raised.
they
both
applied
the
state
statute
of
limitations.
although
in
the
fischbach
case
the
court
said,
they
thought
a
six
months
statute
should
apply
which
i
will
go
into
later
on.
but
they
--
they've
felt
like
this
--
the
six
months
statute
which
is
contained
in
section
10
(b)
of
the
act
were
unfair
labor
practices
should
apply
in
this
kind
of
cases.
but
they
said
were
bound
by
the
well-established
rules
that
we
have
to
apply
state
law
and
they
applied
it.
in
two
cases
involving
the
301
actions,
the
reliford
versus
eastern
coal,
another
sixth
circuit
and
tully
versus
fred
olson
motors,
case
decided
(inaudible)
wisconsin
supreme
court.
incidentally,
both
those
cases
held
that
the
state
law
applied
in
this
very
question
raised.
in
the
last
case,
the
judge
there
also
thought
that
the
six
months
statute
applied
but
felt
--
and
the
district
court
so
held
but
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
holding
that
under
this
well-established
rule
reversed
them
and
said
that
the
state
court
limitation
could
apply.
this
rule
had
been
applied
in
many
other
federal
statutes
that
do
not
have
limitations.
the
courts
have
gotten
along
fine.
i
don't
think
it's
--
and
the
union
is
--
the
petitioner
has
made
quite
a
--
explained
that
because
this
labor
law
and
in
certain
cases
your
honors
have
expressed
that
it
should
have
a
uniform
application.
i
say
that
this
rule
doesn't
do
violence
to
that
because
here,
you
can
have
a
uniform
application
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
contract
and
that
particular
matters
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
that
would
have
necessary
fall
that
you'd
have
to
have
a
uniform
limitations
unless
congress
put
it
in
their.
i
think
it's
desirable
that
probably
there
should
be
a
limitation
in
the
act
itself.
but
i
think
it's
for
congress
to
decide
after
hearings
and
so
forth
to
decide,
what
is
the
proper
act
--
statute
of
limitations
and
i
certainly
would
reject
the
petitioner's
suggestion
that
they
ought
to
be
four
or
five
different
limitations
for
actions
under
301.
there
should
be
--
i
think
the
6-month
statute
which
i
will
next
address
myself
to,
the
--
assuming
just
--
that
this
court
should
adopt
the
statute.
that
--
i
--
in
my
opinion,
it
would
almost
follow,
that
it
should
be
the
6-month
statute
set
out
in
10
(b)
of
the
act
which
is
provided
for
unfair
labor
practice.
now,
petitioner
would
admit
that
the
six
months
would
be
alright
on
the
303
action
but
there
is
where
the
--
the
company
has
to
sue
a
union
for
secondary
boycott.
now,
the
union
in
that
case
would
like
quick
action.
they
want
the
employer
to
sue
six
months.
but
if
--
it
turned
around,
there
go
to
sue
the
company,
the
union
would
suggest
six
years.
i
think
to
be
consistent
and
it
was
pointed
out
in
the
international
versus
fischbach,
that
court
went
into
this
question
very
carefully
as
to
whether
the
6-month
statute
apply.
that
was
a
303
action
for
a
secondary
boycott.
they
said
he
thought
that
six
months
statute
should
apply
and
he
gave
the
congressional
history
where
mr.
--
senator
taft
couldn't
separate
the
various
sections.
it's
all
under
one
act.
and
in
one
section
they
have
this
60
--
this
six
months
limitation
but
in
the
301
section
they
don't
have
it.
but
he
points
out
that
in
many,
many
cases,
an
action
under
301,
just
like
in
the
smith
case,
can
also
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
the
u
--
and
the
board
--
if
the
board
wanted
to
prosecute
that
action
against
the
company
for
an
unfair
labor
practice
they
would
have
been
bound
by
the
6-month
statute.
but
you
can
go
into
the
court
and
there
is
no
statute
and
we
say
that
to
be
consistent
and
to
carry
out
this
uniform
law
then,
if
the
court
adopts
anything
it
should
adopt
the
6-month
statute.
and
in
that
case
under
any
theory,
the
petitioner
could
not
recover
in
this
case.
now,
getting
to
this
question
and
incidentally
i
think
your
honor
answers
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
awhile
ago
that
whether
or
not
there
is
any
place
you
could
draw
from
or
a
source
of
creating
a
statute.
we
think
it's
a
perfect
example
of
--
when
you
were
talking
--
the
mcallister
case
that
here
is
a
six-month
statute
in
this
very
act
applying
to
a
different
section
but
overlapping
and
in
many
cases
on
the
identical
facts
we
think
that's
an
obvious
source
for
it
if
this
court
feels
it
should.
my
suggestion
is
to
the
court
and
i'm
sure
the
court
would
not
unnecessarily
assume
lot
of
burdens
of
trying
to
pick
out
which
statutes
would
apply.
that
if
you
do
decide
you
need
to
make
a
formulation
that
six
months
period
isn't
correct.
now
getting
to
this
tolling
question
because
--suppose
the
--
mr.
harry
p.
dees
sir?
mr.
harry
p.
dees
the
federal
government
created
a
cause
--
mr.
harry
p.
dees
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
p.
dees
i
think
in
that
--
mr.
harry
p.
dees
in
that
case
i
think
there
would
have
to
be
some
judicial
formulation
or
conceivably
it
would
never
toll
and
i
suppose
that's
not
beyond
the
realm
of
possibility
although
it
certain
would
be
unreasonable
never
to
toll
an
action.
but
in
the
absence
of
any
statute
it
would
be
up
to
the
court
to
judicially
create
one
and
i
suggest
that
a
state
court
might
be
hesitant
to
do
it
thinking
it
(inaudible)
this
court
might
be
able
to
do
so.
mr.
harry
p.
dees
well,
what
is
the
state
cause
of
action
--
mr.
harry
p.
dees
well
sir,
the
state
cause
of
action
to
be
the
same
as
this,
it
would
be
a
suit
on
this
--
mr.
harry
p.
dees
--
employment
contract.
mr.
harry
p.
dees
oh,
yes
sir,
you
already
could
file
suit
on
a
contract,
an
employee
could
file
a
suit
in
indiana
state
courts
on
an
employment
--
mr.
harry
p.
dees
sir?
mr.
harry
p.
dees
yes
sir.
they
have
special
statute.
we've
set
about
in
our
appendix
to
our
brief,
these
penalty
statutes
of
indiana
in
which
they
say
that
you
have
to
pay
the
employee's
wages
within
ten
days.
if
you
do
not
pay
within
ten
days
after
the
demand,
then
he
is
entitled
to
a
dollar
a
day
damages
for
each
day
that
you
refuse
to
pay
him
until
it
reaches
double
the
amount
of
the
pay.
and
then
there
--
he's
entitled
to
double
damages
and
he's
also
entitled
to
statutory
attorney
fees.
and
that's
exactly
what
the
petitioner
is
seeking
to
recover
in
this
case,
that's
why
we
think
when
he
says
this
an
action
exclusively
on
this
written
labor
contract
it
just
can't
be
if
you
read
his
complaint
because
on
the
very
first
page
of
--
the
very
first
of
his
complaint
he
sets
out
the
sta
--
the
--
these
indiana
statutes
on
which
he's
recovering.
i've
set
it
out
on
page
11
of
my
brief
because
we
think
it's
so
pertinent
here.
paragraph
10,
that
pursuant
to
the
acts,
they
generally
assume
the
state
of
indiana
of
the
year
1911
chapter
68
and
of
--
for
thereof
and
in
accordance
with
the
acts
of
the
general
assembly
for
the
year
1933,
chapter
47.
there
is
due
the
employees
represented
by
the
claim,
an
amount
equal
the
double
unpaid
wages
which
amount
is
in
excess
of
$80,000.
therefore,
the
plaintiff
asked
judgment
against
the
defendant
corporation
in
the
amount
of
$40,000.
now,
that's
the
amount
of
wages
which
that
would
be
the
claim
and
the
only
claim
he
would
have
under
the
so-called
written
contract
he
says.
but,
they
go
further
together
with
liquidated
damages
in
the
amount
of
$80,000
together
with
the
reasonable
attorney
--
for
plaintiffs'
attorneys
and
such
other
relief.
so
you
see
his
whole
case
when
he
argued
that
this
is
bottomed
squarely
on
the
written
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
smith
that
you
got
to
apply
a
20-year
statute
of
limitation
falls
on
the
very
weight
of
his
own
complaint
in
which
he
is
relying
desperately
on
the
indiana
statutes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
wants
to
recover
more
under
this
indiana
family
statutes
than
he
does
on
the
primary
cause
of
action.
mr.
harry
p.
dees
paragraph
10,
your
honor.
i've
set
out
--
mr.
harry
p.
dees
on
page
--
mr.
harry
p.
dees
yes.
it
set
out
in
page
3
of
the
record.
the
whole
compliant
is
set
out.
mr.
harry
p.
dees
i've
set
out
the
excerpt,
paragraph
10
and
the
prior
at
page
11
in
my
brief
on
the
first
argument.
mr.
harry
p.
dees
no
sir
i
don't
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
under
indiana
law,
that
question
was
never
really
raised
below
because
i
don't
think
the
court
ever
had
decided.
there's
a
two
years
statute
of
limitations
in
indiana
after
recovering
any
penalty.
so
actually
this
case
would
have
been
barred
on
this
penalty
part
under
a
two-year
statute
of
limitations
which
we
lift
--
mr.
harry
p.
dees
yes,
sir,
that's
right.
now,
the
other
action
your
honor
as
we
--
we
think
the
lower
court
correctly
decided
under
a
series
of
indiana
cases
that
the
6-year
statute
applied
because
this
contract
was
partially
oral
and
partially
in
the
writing.
now,
were
not
suggesting
to
the
court
that
is
the
basis
of
this
action,
i'm
going
to
have
to
rely
upon
this
union
contract
to
certain
extent.
but
it's
like
any
contract
that
is
partially
in
oral
a
partial
in
writing
under
a
statute
of
limitations
law.
they
say
that
unless
you
can
take
the
whole
contract
--
the
whole
law
suit
--
frankly,
from
the
four
corners
of
the
contract
that
you
have
to
resort
to
parole
evidence.
and
if
you
had
to
resort
to
parole
evidence
then
that
is
the
same
as
if
it
was
the
contract
not
in
writing
so
far
as
statutes
of
limitations
are
concern
and
you
apply
in
indiana
the
six
years
statute
of
limitations
for
a
contract
not
in
writing.
i
think
your
honors,
i
might
out
this
one,
i
think
there's
a
misconception
that
this
question
of
parole
evidence,
parole
evidence
means
extrinsic
evidence.
it
does
not
(inaudible)
--
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
a
verbal
testimony.
in
other
words,
and
the
reason
i
make
this
point
is
that
in
the
reply
brief
that
suggested,
“well,
you
didn't
need
anything
here.
we
could
prove
this
written
--
we
could
prove
the
employment
relationship
here
by
the
payroll
records.”
that
under
indiana
law
and
under
well
established
law
is
extrinsic
or
parole
evidence
which
brings
it
squarely
within
the
statutes
of
limitation
where
they
say
if
a
contract
is
partially
paroled
and
partially
in
writing
this
oral
statute
or
rule
statute
of
limitations
applies.
indiana
says,
“contracts
not
in
writing”.
so
we
--
i
want
to
make
that
point
that
there
is
a
difference
that
parole
evidence
does
not
necessarily
mean
verbal
testimony.
it
means
any
extrinsic
evidence
that
you
have
to
introduce
on
a
court
to
make
out
to
your
law
suit.
now,
if
he
says
this
is
exclusively
on
a
written
contract.
he
carries
that
written
contract
and
quit.
he's
going
to
have
to
introduce
payroll
records
or
something
but
we
go
one
step
further
in
this
case.
we
have
an
affidavit
that
they
were
no
written
contracts
whatever
with
these
employees
that
they
were
all
--
employed
under
a
verbal
oral
contract
and
that
was
not
contested.
they're
controverted,
although
the
plaintiff
or
the
petitioner
had
the
right
to
do
so,
an
--
in
the
--
at
the
court
below
in
our
motion
if
they
wanted
to
controvert
that
so,
you
had
to
take
that
that
in
this
particular
case.
now
some
cases,
there
may
be
cases
where
an
employee
signs
up
a
written
contract
and
there
--
and
incorporates
the
terms
that
this
were
the
written
--
the
20-year
statute
of
indiana
could
apply.
but
this
is
not
such
a
case
as
shown
by
the
record
here
because
their
affidavit
shows
that
this
were
oral
verbal
contracts
and
not
written
contracts
of
employment.
and
you've
got
to
create
the
employment
relationship
before
there
can
be
an
action
on
the
contract
itself.
mr.
harry
p.
dees
no,
sir.
i
do
not
say
that.
and
i
say
that
in
this
case,
they
can
rely
as
part
of
there
proof
would
have
to
be
on
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
but
they
would
have
to
go
outside
of
that
and
have
to
show
an
employment
relationship
which
would
take
parole
or
extrinsic
evidence.
mr.
harry
p.
dees
that
--
they
wouldn't
be
entitled
but
except
for
the
written
agreement,
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
that
part
is
bottomed
partly
on
it.
it's
partly
on
that
and
partly
on
the
verbal
employment
of
contract.
they
have
to
prove
both.
they
have
to
prove
that
the
written
part
of
the
contract
should
create
the
vacation
pay
they
claim.
but
they
have
to
also
introduce
parole
evidence
to
show
that
this
particular
employee
worked
for
this
company.
mr.
harry
p.
dees
well
--
yes,
sir.
i
mean
if
he
--
mr.
harry
p.
dees
that's
correct.
that
--
the
only
point
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
in
some
instances
there
may
be
a
completely
written
contract
with
the
employee
himself.
he
may
sign
a
written
contract
would
be
so
that
there
is
no
parole
evidence
necessary
at
all
that
the
written
--
his
employment
contract
is
in
writing,
the
union
contract
is
incorporate
by
reference,
its
all
a
written
contract.
in
that
case,
if
that
has
been
the
case
here,
i'd
say
we
might
be
in
trouble
on
the
20
years
statute
of
limitations
of
indiana
but
because
it
was
not
that
way
because
there
is
the
necessity
parole
or
extrinsic
evidence,
in
order
to
maintain
this
action,
the
indiana
courts
have
said.
the
seventh
circuit
court
in
exactly
the
same
set
--
factual
situation
in
--
on
which
the
seventh
court
relied
below
said
that
in
these
cases,
because
the
employee
is
not
named
in
the
contract.
therefore,
you
have
to
use
parole
or
extrinsic
evidence
then
for
statute
of
limitations
purposes
that
takes
it
out
of
the
written
contract
category
of
20
years
and
puts
it
in
the
6-year
category
or
6
years
that's
what
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harry
p.
dees
the
indiana
court
never
got
to
that
question
in
this
case.
mr.
harry
p.
dees
yes,
sir,
your
honor,
at
footnote
--
mr.
harry
p.
dees
yes
sir,
it
does.
it
a
footnote
plus
the
best
exposé
of
the
indiana
law.
i
suggest
your
honor
read
the
district
judge's
opinion
in
this
case.
he
analyzed
it
very
carefully,
quoted
from
the
two
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
who
were
construing
this
indiana
6-year
statute
on
a
case
involving
a
union
contract
where
employees,
the
identical
facts
in
this
case
were
before
the
seventh
circuit
in
earlier
cases
construing
this
identical
indiana
statute
and
that's
in
the
district
judge's
opinion
which
is
set
out
in
the
record
at
page
20,
starts
at
the
--
its
--
starts
at
page
12
--
1223
of
the
records
of
district
court's
opinion
which
i
think
very
clearly
--
mr.
harry
p.
dees
--
points
out
under
indiana
law
this
case
would
be
governed
by
the
6-year
statute
of
limitation.
now,
in
my
few
remaining
minutes,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
these
tolling
questions
which
on
any
statute
which
the
court
would
have
say
is
more
than
six
months,
the
petitioners
would
seek
to
avoid
the
influence
of
any
statute.
we
say
first
that
this
case
of
johnson
versus
hoosier
cardinal
should
not
even
be
considered
by
this
court.
it
was
not
in
the
record
below.
we've
already
point
out
the
dangers
of
considering
the
case
of
this
point
because
here
we're
getting
in
a
dispute
even
before
this
court
on
the
facts.
we
deny
some
of
the
charges
made
in
this
reply
brief.
so
that's
one
good
reason
sir.
and
i
think
this
court's
precedent
had
said
if
the
case,
the
point
hasn't
been
raised
below,
it
should
be
raised
--
it
could
not
be
raised
here
for
the
first
time.
and
certainly
he
says,
“well,
it
wouldn't
have
done
us
any
good
but
i
don't
know
how
anybody
can
tell
what
effect
it
might
have
had
had
that
been
an
issue
in
it,
although,
i
do
not
think
under
the
facts
in
that
burnett
case.
the
facts
here,
it
would
have
been
applicable
at
all."
i
don't
think
as
mr.
chief
justice
fortas
has
suggested,
i
don't
think
there's
going
to
be
any
excuse
for
that
almost
a
year,
11
and
a
half
months,
between
the
time
that
the
filed
decision
in
the
state
court
was
rendered
and
this
suit
were
filed
in
federal
court.
i
think
that's
a
delay
that's
--
that
they're
never
going
to
be
able
to
explain.
also
there
--
and
as
i
pointed
out,
there
was
an
eight
months
delay
in
filing
even
in
the
original
action.
so
you
got
two
years
of
delays
into
that
--
therefore,
he
suggested
that
anything
less
than
two
years
would
be
tolled
but
we
say
that
that
action
should
not
apply
at
all
and
that
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
the
reasons
why
the
burnett
case
should
not
apply.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
harry
p.
dees
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
p.
dees
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
if
it
had
to
be
then
it
should
be
a
reasonably
short
statute.
i
see
no
reason
why
they
shouldn't
--
anyone
bring
an
action
of
this
type
in
six
months
whether
that's
too
short,
i
don't
know?
i
don't
feel
i'm
confident
to
suggest
to
this
court
what
the
statute
should
be.
i
frankly
think
--
mr.
harry
p.
dees
that's
right.
mr.
harry
p.
dees
well,
i
think
then
it
should
be
--
mr.
harry
p.
dees
no,
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
harry
p.
dees
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
in
(inaudible)
i
think
that
agreed
on
the
uniformity.
i
think
that
the
court
should
leave
it
like
it
is,
that
the
state
statutes
of
limitations
apply
in
these
cases.
mr.
harry
p.
dees
well,
i
think
to
be
consistent
it
would
have
to
adopt
the
six
months
flat
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
harry
p.
dees
thank
you
sir.
