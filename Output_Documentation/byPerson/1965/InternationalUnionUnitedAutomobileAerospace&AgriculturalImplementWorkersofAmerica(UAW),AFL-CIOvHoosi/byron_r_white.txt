mr.
schlossberg,
this
is
ultimately
the
matter
of
a
congressional
intention,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
has
it
more
ordinarily
than
the
rule
or
not
that
the
--
when
the
federal
statute
doesn't
have
a
limitations
included
in
a
--
that
the
courts
have
gone
to
state
law

congress
nowadays
with
the
adoption
statute,
it
doesn't
put
a
limitations
period
in
it,
should
you
really
assume
that
they
intend
the
courts
to
make
one
up
or
do
you
think
in
somewhere
you
--
that
congress

view
of
the
rule
that

would
be

would
intend
state
law
to
apply?
justice
byron
r.

well,
that
might
be
true
if
congress
had
said
expressly,
this
so
many
words
that
the
courts
were
supposed
to
fashion
federal
law
into
301.
you
don't
claim
that
in
the
act
either,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
very
well.
