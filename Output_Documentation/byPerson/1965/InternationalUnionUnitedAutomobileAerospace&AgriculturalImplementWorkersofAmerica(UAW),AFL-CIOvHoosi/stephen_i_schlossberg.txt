mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
which
i
shall
detail
for
you
here
today
present
essentially
two
questions
affecting
national
labor
law.
the
first
question
is,
shall
a
uniform
federal
time
limit
apply
to
suits
under
section
301
(a)
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
as
amended?
or
shall
the
variant
state
statutes
of
limitations
apply
to
those
suits?
the
second
question
is,
if
state
time
limits
are
held
to
be
applicable
shall
a
suit
for
vacation
pay
on
the
written
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
be
treated
for
the
purposes
of
selecting
the
applicable
time
limitation
be
treated
as
a
suit
under
federal
law
and
governed
by
federal
principles
or
be
treated
as
a
suit
under
state
law
or
wages
under
state
principles
and
therefore
determined
by
state
principles
of
law.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
yes,
your
--
yes
your
honor,
it
is.
it's
a
--
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
i
may
have
stated
a
little
differently
than
it
is
in
the
book
but
it
is
here.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
in
the
event,
the
court
--
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
i
think
not.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
on
september
1st,
1955,
the
union
--
the
petitioner
in
this
case
entered
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
the
hoosier
cardinal
company.
among
the
contract
provisions
in
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
one
which
required
certain
vacations
for
employees
employed
under
that
contract.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
there
was
a
further
provision
that
employee's
who
were
eligible
for
vacation
on
the
basis
of
time's
work
--
time
worked
and
who
had
not
taken
their
vacation
on
the
previous
year
should
receive
vacation
pay
at
the
time
of
termination,
if
they
were
terminated
for
any
reason.
on
june
the
1st,
1957,
approximately
a
couple
of
years
after
the
contract
was
first
entered
into
over
100
workers
were
terminated,
workers
who
had
not
taken
their
vacations
in
the
previous
year.
the
company
refused
to
pay
their
vacation
pay
required
by
the
agreement.
eight
months
later,
the
union's
attorneys,
local
counsel
filed
in
the
indiana
state
court
a
class
action
seeking
recovery
of
the
vacation
pay
due
the
employees
covered
by
the
hoosier
cardinal-uaw
collective
bargaining
agreement.
at
that
time,
this
court
will
recall
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
association
of
westinghouse
employees
against
westinghouse
electric
corporation
appeared
to
the
bar
to
preclude
a
section
301
suit
in
the
federal
courts
for
this
kind
of
claim.
on
january
21st,
1959,
the
state
court
ruled
that
the
class
action
was
improper
under
state
law.
thereafter,
each
employee
in
the
class,
each
employee
covered
by
the
agreement
assigned
his
wage
claim
to
a
union
representative
and
the
complaint
was
amended
to
provide
for
a
suit
by
a
union
representative
in
his
name.
the
court
then
ruled
that
the
assignment
method
of
suit
was
improper
in
indiana
and
further
amended
complaints
were
entered.
in
essence,
the
original
class
action
was
reinstituted.
on
demur
from
the
company,
the
trail
court
finally
held
that
the
class
suit
method
was
improper
and
dismissed
the
suit.
this
case
was
appealed
to
the
indiana
appellate
court.
and
on
april
18,
1963,
approximately
almost
6
years
after
the
right
had
vested
the
suit
was
finally
dismissed
by
the
indiana
courts.
in
the
mean
time,
smith
against
the
evening
news
in
371
united
states
in
1962
had
enlightened
the
bar
and
had
effectively
in
our
view
overruled
the
westinghouse
case.
so
on
april
8th,
1964
less
than
a
year
after
the
final
dismissal
of
the
indiana
action,
this
section
301
(a)
suit
was
instituted
in
the
united
states
district
court
--
pardon
me
your
honors,
of
the
southern
district
of
indiana.
in
addition
to
citing
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
asserting
jurisdiction
under
section
301
(a),
the
complaints
sought
an
additional
remedy
on
the
state
law
of
double
wages.
whether
we're
entitled
to
that
remedy
or
not,
we
do
not
know.
we
thought
the
decisions
for
this
court
were
not
clear
on
that
issue.
at
any
rate,
that
remedy
was
sought
with
the
301
action
--
301
(a)
action.
the
company
in
the
united
states
district
court
urged
their
lack
of
jurisdiction
citing
westinghouse
and
saying
also
to
the
court
that
the
indiana
statute
of
limitations
for
oral
contracts
which
i
know
is
six
years
govern
the
suit
because
said
the
company,
“this
suit
is
bottomed
on
the
oral
contracts
of
hire
and
not
on
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.”
the
district
court
on
november
the
12th,
1964,
upheld
the
company's
contention
as
to
the
statute
of
limitations
and
dismissed
the
union
suit.
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
the
union's
principal
arguments
were,
first,
that
state
statute
of
limitations
do
not
and
cannot
apply
to
section
301
contract
actions
because
these
suits
are
governed
exclusively
by
federal
law.
and
second,
that
in
any
event,
this
suit
was
timely
because
it
was
wholly
on
a
written
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
not
on
an
oral
contract
of
hire.
on
june
4th,
1965,
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court
holding
that
the
indiana
state
statute
of
limitations
six
years
on
oral
contracts
governed
because
the
suit
is
bottomed
on
the
oral
contract
of
hire.
the
court
of
appeals
went
further
and
held
that
the
suit
was
really
a
suit
by
a
union
as
an
agent
to
enforce
pay
rights
of
individual
workers
and
that
here
involved
was
a
question
wholly
of
state
law.
very
frankly,
if
the
court
please,
our
problem
in
the
presentation
of
this
case
boils
down
to
in
essence,
a
situation
where
we
feel,
we
cannot
lose
under
either
theory.
in
other
words,
if
the
court
adopts
which
we
hope
and
fully
expect
it
to
adopt,
our
theory
that
uniformed
federal
limitations
must
apply
to
federal
suits
under
301
(a)
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
in
lined
with
that
theory,
follows
through
on
its
decision
in
burnett
against
the
new
york
central
railroad.
then
on
the
federal
principles
of
timeliness,
this
suit
is
timely.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court
holds
that
state
limitations
must
apply,
we
think
it
clear
on
the
principles
of
federal
law
that
this
is
a
suit
exclusively
on
the
written
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
not
on
an
oral
contract
in
the
indiana
written
statute
of
limitations
which
is
20
years
would
apply.
while
it
may
be
easier
and
a
simpler
task
to
urge
upon
this
court
the
20
years
statute
because
this
is
clearly
a
written
contract,
we
very
strongly
urged
on
this
court,
the
federal
principles,
the
uniformity
principles
so
important
to
the
development
of
section
301
(a)
law.
and
we
say
that
we
want
uniform
federal
time
standards
to
govern.
we
believe
that
the
adoption
of
state
statute
of
limitation
which
vary
and
we
have
put
together
a
table
in
our
petitioner
for
certiorari
in
appendix
b
of
our
petition
for
certiorari
that
state
statute
of
limitations
which
vary
from
six
months
to
20
years
would
inevitably
lead
to
a
crazy
quilt
pattern
of
limitations,
confusing
labor
and
management,
the
bar,
and
even
the
lower
courts.
the
real
problem
in
this
case
as
we
view
it
is
that
the
seventh
circuit
viewed
this
suit
as
one
of
state
law
and
their
rationale
is
at
war
with
the
federal
law
which
must
be
supreme
in
this
area.
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
suit
on
the
express
provisions
of
a
written
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
actually
based
on
an
oral
contract
of
hire
and
if
the
union
sues
only
as
an
agent
here
on
a
purely
state
claim,
if
we
say,
not
only
anachronistic
but
offensive
to
the
constitution.
we
see
it
is
very
clear
that
congress
has
intended
for
that
to
be
a
uniform
body
of
federal
law
under
section
301
(a).
we
take
that
mandate
from
the
intent
of
congress
as
determined
in
lincoln
mills
in
353
united
states
and
dowd
box
of
368
and
in
the
lucas
flour
case
in
369
united
states.
as
this
--
toward
this
court
thought,
there
must
be
comprehension
in
the
formulation
of
the
law
interpreting
the
statute.
the
national
policy
as
we
understand
it
is
to
see
that
identical
terms
of
a
contract
whether
enforced
to
might
state
law
or
a
federal
--
in
a
state
court
or
a
federal
court
and
no
matter
which
court
will
have
the
same
meaning,
and
that
mandates
of
the
statute
will
have
the
same
meaning
no
matter
which
court
enforces
them.
the
key
to
section
301
(a)
as
we
see
it
is
a
national
policy
that
commitments
once
made
will
be
honored
and
that
the
fruits
of
a
bargain
will
be
enjoyed.
state
statutes
of
limitations,
any
statute
of
limitations
if
you
please,
so
far
affects
substantive
rights
that
it
can
determine
the
results
in
the
case
as
it
did
in
this
one.
we
think
it
paid
them
that
where
state
contract
limitations
varying
from
60
days
to
20
years,
there
is
bound
to
be
confusion
and
uncertainty
in
the
interpretation
and
administration
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
and
this
kind
of
variety
and
confusion
decides
disruptive
a
labor
relation
in
interstate
commerce
is
likely
to
encourage
forum
shopping.
moreover
and
perhaps
most
important,
the
antiquated
state
theories
of
labor
law
which
have
been
rejected
in
the
formulation
of
national
labor
law,
put
it
back
into
the
field
of
labor
relations.
as
in
this
seventh
circuit
opinion,
we
are
likely
to
have
anachronistic
conflicting
rules
of
law
which
are
at
war
with
federal
principles.
we
believe
that
this
court
should
adopt
the
uniform
federal
standards
for
the
time
limitations
on
301
suits.
we
believe
that
on
a
suit
like
this
on
a
breach
of
contract
that
six
years
would
be
an
appropriate
time
for
the
court
to
adopt.
we
say
that
because
the
median
statute
of
limitations
among
the
states
as
we've
glean
from
our
table
is
approximately
six
years.
six
years
is
the
time
set
out
for
contract
suits
in
the
court
of
claims.
but
we
believe
--
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
well
--
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
i
think
your
honor
suggested
it,
mcallister
case
suggested
that
you
might
look
at
the
statute
in
the
jones
act
to
apply
to
other
cases.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
that
is
right.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
well,
as
i
see
--
well
--
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
i
see
the
development
of
this
law
there
are
two
sources
for
the
development
of
301
--
of
law
under
301
(a).
one
is
the
statute
itself,
national
labor
relations
act,
as
amended
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
the
other
is
judicial
inventiveness.
now,
i
think
that
we
can't
go
half
way
on
this
field
that
if
all
on
this
law
is
going
to
be
federal
law,
it
should
be
federal
law
exclusively
and
that
--
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
three
years,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
we
don't
have
a
congressional
indication
of
a
time
period
or
--
on
this
particular
statute.
but
we
do
have
congress
saying
that
suit
should
be
brought
in
the
court
of
claims
in
six
years
which
would
--
it
seems
to
me
given
indication
of
its
feeling
of
the
contract.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
yes,
your
honor.
and
in
a
way
this
is
a
national
contract
that's
obviously
not
a
completely
voluntary
contract
as
a
private
contract
might
be.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
it
would,
your
honor,
if
the
court
follows
through
with
that
federal
reasoning
and
then
follows
its
tolling
principles
as
set
out
in
burnett
against
new
york
central
railroad.
in
the
burnett
case
which
was
a
federal
employer's
liability
action,
this
court
held
that
where
part
of
the
time
period
of
the
limitations
period
is
consumed
in
a
state
court
and
that
suit
is
later
dismissed
on
procedural
grounds
that
action
is
tolled
for
the
period
of
the
state
litigation.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
no,
we
didn't
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
we
didn't
--
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
no,
we
did
not
your
honor.
we
did
not
do
that
in
the
court
below.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
i
think
it
is
your
honor.
because
in
the
court
below
--
first
of
all
burnett
came
down
after
the
briefs
have
been
filed.
the
burnett
case
came
down
from
this
court
after
the
briefs
have
been
filed
in
the
seventh
circuit
so
that
burnett
itself
was
supervening
law.
but
in
any
event,
this
argument
was
really
unavailable
to
us
because
both
the
district
court
and
the
seventh
circuit,
it
indicated
they
were
unwilling
to
accept
our
premise
that
federal
law
of
principles
govern
here.
and
it
would
have
been
of
no
avail
to
say,
you
must
go
one
step
farther
from
the
foundation
we've
built
and
sophisticatedly
apply
a
tolling
rule.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
well,
i
guess
we
couldn't
really
know.
i'm
just
telling
you
that's
the
way
it
appears,
your
honor.
we
don't
say,
however,
that
you
need
to
adopt
a
set
period
for
all
suits
under
301.
we
recognize
that
some
suits
under
301
are
in
the
nature
of
equitable
actions,
suits
to
compel
arbitration,
suits
for
injunction,
suits
to
enforce
arbitrations.
we
think
there
is
a
federal
equity
rule
which
could
be
applied
to
these
suits.
on
the
other
hand,
we
think
that
suits
which
are
in
the
nature
of
unfair
representation
of
it
joined
with
301
(a)
actions
could
be
treated
as
suits
involving
injury
to
person
or
to
property
and
we
would
suggest
there
that
an
appropriate
state
--
an
appropriate
federal
statute
of
limitations
would
be
two
to
three
years
which
is
the
federal
tort
--
most
federal
tort
actions
and
also
the
normal
state
tort
limitation.
for
section
303
actions,
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
six
months
would
be
an
appropriate
standard
because
it
is
the
10
(b)
statute
of
limitations
from
the
act
and
section
303
is
almost
in
the
words
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
yes,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
well,
i
don't
know
of
any
--
the
reason
for
that
delay.
let
me
say
that
this
whole
case
though
is
not
a
case
where
anybody
was
sleeping
on
there
rights.
i
mean,
after
all
the
union
and
the
employees
here
in
one
form
or
another
was
vigorously
pursuing
this
claim
from
--
frantically
from
the
time
it
arrived.
now,
it
had
mishaps
after
mishaps
in
the
federal
courts.
it
--
one
--
in
the
state
courts,
excuse
me,
the
state
judge
at
one
time
wrote
a
letter
and
said,
“let
each
individual
employee
bring
a
suit.
you
can't
bring
it
as
a
class
action.”
i
think
that
the
trial
counsel
and
that
parties
in
this
case
were
actually
confused
and
that
would
be
my
explanation
for
the
11
months.
i
mean,
we
were
still
smarty
from
a
series
of
defeat
and
mishaps
and
that's
--
about
the
only
answer
i
can
give
you
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
to
turn
now
to
the
argument
we
make
that
--
even
under
the
indiana
statute,
this
case
is
timely,
and
again
i
say
to
the
court,
that
we
hope
you
will
adopt
uniform
federal
standards
and
not
restrict
this
case
to
--
and
not
turn
301
(a)
actions
over
to
the
vagaries
of
state
statute
of
limitation.
we
think
in
a
federal
principle,
that
a
suit
brought
in
the
expressed
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
a
written
contract
in
federal
law.
and
we
think
to
say
that
that
suit
is
bottomed
on
an
oral
contract
of
hire
and
to
transform
a
written
contract
into
an
oral
contract
for
purposes
of
the
states
statute
of
limitations
is
a
distortion
of
federal
law
and
a
confliction
with
federal
law.
and
we
think
that
even
if
the
state
time
period
is
applied,
it
is
absorbed
into
the
interstices
from
the
federal
system
and
becomes
a
part
of
federal
law
adopted
for
convenience
from
a
state
and
that
--
under
that
federal
law,
a
written
contract
must
be
treated
as
20
years.
now,
we
think
20
years
is
a
long
time
in
labor
relations
for
a
contract
to
go.
but
we
nevertheless
think
that
under
this
case,
if
principles
of
federal
law
supreme,
we
would
have
to
win
on
that
theory.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
not
trespass
on
the
court's
time.
i
do
think
that
the
argument
of
my
distinguished
opponent
underlines
the
complexities
of
local
law
that
we've
been
to
this
kind
of
a
situation.
his
very
explication
of
the
indiana
law
that
a
written
collective
bargaining
agreement
because
proof
to
show
who
the
people
covered
by
the
agreement
may
be
needed
from
outside
sources
unless
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
written
agreement
of
hire
or
one
document
is
anachronistic,
i
say,
and
it
shows
the
troubles
we
get
into
in
this
field.
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
--
a
word
more
about
the
10
(b)
problem,
the
6-month
statute.
i
think
this
court
by
implication
in
smith
against
the
evening
news
rejected
for
the
six
months
10
(b)
statute
of
the
unfair
labor
practices
sections
of
the
act.
i
note
that
in
footnote
5
on
page
198
of
smith
against
the
evening
news,
this
court
noted
that
that
suit
which
involved
the
unfair
labor
practice
was
not
brought
within
the
six
months
period
of
the
labor
board's
jurisdiction.
now,
i
think
there
is
no
more
reason
for
this
court
to
adopt
the
six
months
statute
on
contract
actions
than
there
is
for
it
to
allow
preemption
of
the
labor
board
in
contract
actions.
i
do
think
that
the
reason
for
the
6-month
statute
and
unfair
labor
practices,
it
is
well-grounded
in
public
policy.
they
are
in
the
nature
of
toward
actions
in
most
cases
and
the
witnesses
should
be
gotten
fast
and
the
investigation
by
the
administrative
bodies
should
be
completed
in
a
hurry.
but
sometimes
and
i
do
not
wish
to
get
in
to
an
argument
with
my
opponent
in
an
unseemly
argument
on
the
facts
here.
but
i
say
that
sometimes
we
have
to
--
we
--
in
written
contracts
we
know
what
we're
doing.
when
we
have
a
defense
like
the
republic
against
maddox
raised
here
and
i
do
think
that
case
is
good
and
right
but
if
were
raised
below
there
may
be
a
reason
why
the
agreements
procedure.
i
don't
want
to
argue
about
the
facts
but
i'm
sure
that
there
needs
to
be
development
of
the
reasons
why
the
agreements
procedure
wasn't
used
--
if
it
wasn't
used.
and
i
do
represent
to
the
court
that
the
non-record
facts
that
we
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
republic
against
maddox
argument
are
based
entirely
on
notes
which
we
received
from
union
representatives
who
were
present.
now,
i
don't
know
if
they're
accurate.
i
can't
test
to
that
but
i
can
only
say
that
this
kind
of
issue
needs
to
be
developed.
there's
no
stipulated
record
on
those
facts.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
i
would
answer
your
question
this
way.
i
would
say
that
in
the
ordinary
case
where
there
are
no
compelling
considerations
of
uniformity
and
of
regularity
then
in
the
ordinary
case
i
would
say
that
it
is
appropriate
for
the
federal
government
to
adopt
the
state
statute
and
to
apply.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
i
think
mr.
justice
white
that
congress
intended
the
statue
to
be
substantive
federal
law
and
they
must
have
intended
that
these
contracts
and
this
statute
be
interpreted
the
same
all
over
whether
in
a
state
court
or
a
federal
court
as
this
court
has
thought.
i
think
they
intended
that
not
only
substantive
but
procedural
law
be
the
same
and
i
think
that
what
--
whether
you
call
a
statute
of
limitations
substantive
or
procedural
in
lined
with
the
whole
intent
of
congress
in
these
various
parse
words
in
301
(a).
they
must
have
intended
a
uniform
limitation.
mr.
stephen
i.
schlossberg
no,
you
don't
your
honor.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
