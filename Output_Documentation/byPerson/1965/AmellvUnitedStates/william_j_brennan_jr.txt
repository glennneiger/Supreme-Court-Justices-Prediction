is
that

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
get
it
mr.
eldridge
that
the
last
determent
sequence
now
was
the
deletion
of
the
proviso
in
the
public
vessels
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suits
in
admiralty
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
the
last
sequence
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
now
is
executed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
a
suggestion,
you
said,
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
accepted
by
the?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
keep
saying
clarifies
but
you
mean
to
settle
the
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
if
you're
right,
what
else
is
left
in
this
case?
what
else
is
for
us
to
do?
if
you're
right
and
we
agree
with
your
view
of
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
the
effect
is
what's
left
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you
see
now,
that's
based
on
what
on
some
federal
employees
compensation
act
that
there
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
agreeing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
agreeing
with
you
about
the
effect
of
the
1960
act
doesn't
answer
this
--
doesn't
finally
answer
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you've
got
about
three
minutes
left
to
give
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
even
taking
johansen
and
patterson
applying
the
principles,
you
argue
that
that
would
come
out
on
your
side
because
you
do
have
the
specific
statute
dealing
with
a
specific
type
of
client.
