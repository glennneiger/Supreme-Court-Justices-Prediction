justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
scribner,
in
one
respect,
the
congress
has
exempted
somewhat
or
excluded
seamen
from
the
coverage
of
acts
otherwise
applicable
to
government
employees,
hasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
classification
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
they
exclude
seamen,
why'd
they
exclude
seamen?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
just
says
this
chapter
shall
not
apply
to
officers
and
members
of
the
crew
of
the
vessel.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
says
by
the
maritime,
by
practices
in
the
maritime
industry.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless,
nevertheless
the
rules
that
apply
to
other
government
employees
as
applied
to
the
seamen?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
--
do
you
say
that
by
adding
--
by
expanding
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
it
comes
to
that
very
act
contracted
the
tucker
act
under
the
principles
of
johnson.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
who
proposed
the
bill,
was
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
government
support
this
bill
or
opposed
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
certainly
wrote
a
letter
to
the
committee
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
support
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
origin
of
this
specific
thing
you're
relying
on
was
with
the
department
of
justice?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
whole
thing
is
primarily
is
the
problem
of
waiving
sovereign
immunity,
isn't
it?
that's
what
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
any
non-governmental
employees
work
on
public
vessel?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
there
are,
i
don't
suppose
anybody
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
weren't
the
government
employees
there's
no
question
that
their
wage
claims
would
be
covered
by
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
nor
the
plaintiff's
claim
is
that
no
matter
what
--
no
matter
what
this
1960
amendment
did
with
regards
to
seaman's
wage
claim,
it
didn't
reach
--
it
didn't
take
the
government
employees
out
from
under
the
tucker
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
only
--
the
only
--
the
only
basis
is
the
only
jurisdictional
ground
he's
got
is
the
tucker
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
generally
applicable
to
the
government
contract
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
says
that
no
matter
what
1960
act
did
it
didn't
do
this
vis-Ã -vis
government
employee.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
scribner,
do
you
say
that
the
court
of
claims
couldn't
--
let's
assume
that
there
were
some
applicable
admiralty
principles
or
a
rule,
couldn't
the
court
of
claims
apply
them
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
as
well
as
any
other
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
mean
it
couldn't
apply
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
seamen,
i
suppose
seamen
had
always
been
able
to
sue
their
employers
in
admiralty
for
wages.
