mr.
david
scribner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
number
of
government
employees,
albeit
seamen
on
government
vessels
subject
to
civil
service
laws
and
subject
to
all
the
rules
and
regulations
applicable
to
all
government
employees.
they
made
claims
in
the
district
court
for
overtime
pay
which
they
alleged
were
due
them,
this
is
in
three
of
the
cases,
pursuant
to
federal
laws
and
regulations
all
pertaining
to
government
employees.
in
addition,
they
relied
on
the
classification
act,
the
federal
employee
pay
act,
and
as
i
said
other
regulations
pertaining
to
the
issues
involved.
the
court
of
claims
on
the
motion
of
the
government
transferred
each
of
the
four
cases
to
the
district
courts,
in
this
case
the
district
court
of
florida,
district
court
in
new
york,
southern
district
and
to
other
appropriate
courts,
on
the
apparent
ground,
we
have
presumed
this
since
the
court
of
claims
rendered
no
opinion
made
no
statement
except
that
it
cited
forming
cases
that
it
had
transferred
like
without
opinion
like
without
in
the
same
manner
without
any
indication
to
us
as
to
why
they
did
it.
we
must
assume
of
course
that
that
was
done
simply
because
it
was
the
court's
opinion
consonant
with
the
approach
made
by
the
government
that
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
applied
and
that
therefore
the
cases
were
properly
in
admiralty
and
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
those
courts.
of
course
here
we
have
a
relatively
simple
situation.
it
doesn't
raise
many
the
complications
that
have
been
raised
over
the
years
and
i
frankly
was
surprised
to
learn
of
the
difficulties
that
were
involved
in
the
general
area
of
the
application
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
and
the
activity
of
this
court
in
connection
with
it,
but
this
matter
is
a
relatively
simple
matter
in
this
sense.
the
suits
here
are
brought
under
legislation
and
under
regulation
which
has
literally
no
relationship
to
admiralty
law.
the
particular
pieces
of
legislation,
enactments
relate
wholly
and
exclusively
to
government
employees
albeit
among
those
government
employees
necessarily
as
some
who
work
on
vessels.
it
appears
to
be
the
position
of
the
government
that
if
any
employee
works
on
a
vessel
that's
afloat
and
if
waters
are
involved
that
somehow
principles
of
admiralty
or
admiralty
law
are
also
necessarily
involved.
the
fact
is
that
the
basis
of
the
claims
made
by
the
petitioners
has
no
relationship
to
admiralty
law.
now
any
principle
of
admiralty
law
that
would
be
involved
here
would
be
encompassed
essentially
by
title
46
of
the
code.
there
is
not
one
section
in
title
46,
which
also
encompasses
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
as
well
as
the
public
vessels
act,
which
would
in
any
way
be
determinative
or
which
could
be
considered
even
in
respect
to
a
decision
to
be
made
on
the
claims
in
these
cases,
literally
not
one.
now
a
lawyer
in
an
argument
seldom
challenges
his
adversary
to
produce
something
because
he
might
and
it's
too
big
a
risk,
but
i'll
venture
to
say
that
the
government
in
addressing
themselves
to
this
court
could
not
point
to
a
single
enactment
or
provision
of
law
under
title
46
or
under
any
aspect
of
admiralty
law
that
would
in
any
way
affect
the
determination
of
a
court
as
to
whether
the
petitioners
should
or
should
not
prevail
as
government
employees
in
their
wage
claims
against
the
united
states
in
this
case.
there
is
literally
nothing,
i
am
confident
there
is
nothing.
now
the
government
first
makes
the
statement,
and
categorically
by
the
way
in
their
brief,
that
admiralty
law
is
involved.
there
is
no
admiralty
law
involved
and
they
can't
point
to
a
piece
of
legislation
which
would
affect
it.
then
there
is
another
approach
to
it
and
that
is
that
principles
of
admiralty
law
apply.
well,
admiralty
law
would
still
have
to
be
applied
whether
or
not
it
embraces
the
principle
or
a
--
an
ad
hoc
approach.
then
they
recede
apparently
from
that
position
as
they
develop
their
argument
in
the
brief
and
they
talk
in
terms
of
something
called
a
claim
of
a
maritime
nature
or
a
claim
of
a
maritime
character,
and
of
course
that's
meaningless
because
that
could
only
relate
to
law.
it
can
only
relate
to
principles
of
law
which
are
expressed
in
law
somewhere
in
title
46,
or
in
any
other
places
they
could
find
it
if
they
can.
it
is
significant
that
in
not
in
one
place
in
their
brief
is
there
a
citation
to
any
law,
admiralty
law,
which
would
apply
in
this
case.
now
what
i
found
rather
curious,
and
i
was
rather
disappointed
in
the
office,
that
the
government
cites
a
series
of
some
ten
cases
in
two
different
places
in
the
brief
in
support
of
a
proposition
that
the
courts
have
uniformly
held
that
government
employed
seamen
who
sue
for
wages
are
relegated
to
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
or
the
public
vessels
act
as
the
case
may
be.
it's
sad
to
say
that
those
cases
and
i
say
that
professionally,
that
those
cases
do
no
support
that
contention
and
that
anybody
who
read
the
cases
would
know
what
they
say.
and
what
they
referred
to
are
the
cases,
all
the
theories
of
cases
i
could
cite
another
hundreds
of
them,
which
relate
to
the
situation
where
under
the
clarification
act
which
embraced
the
war
shipping
board
type
of
situation
during
war
time
or
war
time
or
related
activities
where
the
government
through
the
war
shipping
administration
and
through
agents,
private
companies
hired
seamen
as
government
employees
on
a
temporary
basis
in
order
to
carry
out
certain
government
merchant
type
of
activity.
mr.
david
scribner
oh
there
is
a
simple
reason
is
that
in
the
other
courts,
the
government
saves
money
and
the
employees
lose
money.
there's
a
six-year
statute
limitations
from
the
court
of
claims
and
there's
a
two-year
statute
limitation
in
the
--
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
and
when
that
issue
arose,
for
instance
in
the
johansen
case
and
in
the
patterson
case
which
came
before
this
court
in
1952
and
i
think
in
1959
respectively,
there
the
question
was,
there
the
government
said
that
the
employees
there
involved
who
were
exactly
in
the
same
position
that
the
employees
here
involved
as
regular
government
civil
service
employees
that
there
they
were
not
really
seamen
and
they
weren't
in
their
vessel,
but
there,
they
were
truly
government
employees
and
the
reason
for
that,
and
they
hardly
convinced
the
court
with,
at
least
a
sharply
divided
court,
and
the
reason
for
that
was
that
again,
the
seaman
would
stand
to
lose
by
the
ultimate
outcome
of
that
because
this
court
said
that
since
they
were
government
employees,
albeit
seaman,
they
were
governed
exclusively
by
the
comprehensive
system
of
laws
of
regulation
which
the
legislature
set
up
through
the
federal
employee
compensation
act
where
injuries
were
involved
or
alleged.
in
other
words,
they
are
the
government
employees'
private
suit
in
the
--
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
government
said
“you
can't
sue
in”
--
i'm
sorry,
in
suits
in
admiralty
act,
the
government
came
in
and
said
“you
can't
sue
in
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
because
you're
really
not
seamen,
you're
government
employees”
and
the
affect
of
that
was
to
throw
them
into
the
federal
employee
compensation
act
where
they
got
the
effective
workman's
compensation
rather
than
the
opportunity
to
go
before
a
jury
and
to
get
some
adequate
compensation
for
their
injuries.
mr.
david
scribner
that's
a
practical
question.
mr.
david
scribner
i
don't
know
of
any
other
substantial
difference
except
that
the
general
--
at
doing
this
is
a
citing
this
is
an
advocate
for
the
position,
i
would
say
that
is
the
practical
outcome
of
it.
talking
generally
about
the
administration
of
justice
in
this
type
of
area,
i
would
say
that
if
what
i
recommend
to
the
court
is
consistent
with
the
administration
of
laws.
now
you
have
laws
affecting
government
employees.
i'd
say
it
would
be
improper
and
discriminatory
to
have
a
body
of
law
that
relates
to
government
employees
and
to
have
excise
from
that
those
relating
to
government
employees
who
are
seamen,
because
we
do
have
a
comprehensive
system
of
laws
that
relates
to
government
employees.
so
that
so
far
as
the
administration
of
justice
is
concerned
in
this
particular
area,
it
would
be
unfair
and
discriminatory
in
that
sense.
i
was
just
indicating
that
the
practical
effect
of
it
would
be
to
deprive
government
employees
who
are
seamen
of
four
years
of
claim
in
their
claims
for
wages
or
the
like.
mr.
david
scribner
well
they've
done
that
in
the
clarification
act.
mr.
david
scribner
well
in
the
classification
act,
the
classification
act
is
one
that
embraces
government
employees
and
there
are
certain
exclusions
within
the
classification
act,
however
--
mr.
david
scribner
but
they
didn't
exclude
sir.
what
they
did
was
to
exclude
them
from
certain
provisions
of
the
classification
act
and
then
the
classification
act
itself
provided
what
should
apply
to
those
particular
seamen.
in
other
words,
the
classification
act
for
instance
refers
to
exempt
seamen
from
certain
general
wage
rates
and
then
provide
specifically
how
the
wage
rate
of
government
employees
who
are
seamen
should
be
determined.
and
that
is
in
accordance
with
the
prevailing
practice
in
the
maritime
industry.
that's
the
way
that
works
out.
so
that
it
doesn't
exempt
them
from
the
act
itself.
it
exempts
them
--
mr.
david
scribner
the
chapter
which
relates
specifically
to
the
manner
on
which
wage
rate
shall
be
determined.
on
the
other
hand,
that
same
provision
indicates
in
fact
how
wage
rates
should
be
determined.
mr.
david
scribner
it's
determined
by
the
agency,
by
the
governmental
agencies
involved,
the
guide
that
is
given
them
of
the
prevailing
practices
of
the
maritime
industry,
and
--
mr.
david
scribner
well
if
you
have
them
not
applying
to
seamen,
you
have
them
not
applying
to
other
employees,
like
wage
board
employees.
now
the
wage
board
employees
who
also
not
--
were
also
exempted
from
certain
provisions,
and
there
are
number
of
exemptions
throughout
where
they
have
a
different
consideration
for
different
governmental
employees,
but
it's
all
within
a
general
comprehensive
framework
of
law
as
it
applies
to
government
employees.
for
instance,
there
was
no
exemption
there
which
would
have
the
effect
of
any
admiralty
law
applying
to
the
seamen,
not
in
the
slightest,
because
the
use
of
the
word
prevailing
practices
is
one,
by
the
way
that's
defined
further
by
the
regulations
of
the
department
of
the
army
or
department
of
the
navy
as
the
case
may
be,
and
they
control
it.
in
other
words,
they
apply
it
but
there's
not
a
question
of
applying
law.
there's
a
question
of
applying
a
practice
which
that
they
determine,
that
is
the
government
determines.
no
other
court,
but
the
government
determines
that
and
the
--
and
the
--
it
does
not
have
the
affect
of
throwing
over
these
government
employees
who
happen
to
be
seamen
into
a
general
category
of
seamen
governed
by
title
46,
which
includes
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
and
the
public
vessels
act.
mr.
david
scribner
i
wish
i
could
be
more
categorical
in
my
answer
on
that,
i'm
puzzled
about
that.
i've
concluded
my
own
approach
to
it
at
least
is,
and
this
is
what
i
suggest
to
the
court
is
that
the
claim
this
before
the
court
whether
it's
a
group
or
an
individual,
it's
a
total
claim
that's
before
the
court.
now
we
--
we
have
--
we
haven't
broken
down
for
instance
in
our
complaint
in
our
petition
to
the
court
in
the
court
of
claims
the
individual
amount
that
they
relate
--
as
they
would
apply
to
each
employee.
now
there's
only
one
case
where
the
total
amount
for
instance
is
less
than
$10,000.00.
now
taking
--
mr.
david
scribner
well
--
mr.
david
scribner
that's
right.
mr.
david
scribner
that's
right.
mr.
david
scribner
right.
mr.
david
scribner
right.
mr.
david
scribner
well
i'd
like
--
mr.
david
scribner
on
the
two
phases
of
the
questions
that
you
raise,
i
would
have
the
following
approach.
first,
the
government
takes
the
position,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it
in
this
case
although
the
orders
are
ambiguous,
i
can
understand
that
completely,
the
government
takes
the
position
or
else
we
wouldn't
be
here,
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
--
that
the
transfers
were
based
on
their
suggestion
for
the
court
below
that
it
should
be
in
admiralty.
in
other
words,
in
transferring
the
cases
to
the
district
court,
we
had
a
right
to
assume,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
district
court
in
florida
assumed
it
enacted
as
such
that
they
were
to
the
admiralty
side
of
the
court.
there's
no
question
about
that
and
that's
the
posture
we're
in.
i
thought
we
were
in
that
posture
and
i'm
certain
that
the
government
would
take
that
position
that
they
necessarily
had
to
be
transferred
to
the
admiralty
side
of
the
court
for
the
purposes
of
applying
admiralty
law
and
not
because
the
district
court
had
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
cases
where
the
claim
were
less
than
$10,000.00.
in
other
words,
that's
not
the
applicable
feature
in
this
case
and
i'm
sure
that's
the
position
or
else
we
wouldn't
be
arguing
this
case
before
as
that
we
do.
there
isn't
a
word
for
the
contrary
in
the
position
taken
on
it.
now
so
far
as
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
is
concerned
where
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
claims
under
$10,000.00
as
there
is
under
the
statute,
as
under
the
tucker
act,
the
fact
is
that
it
would
be
up
to
the
plaintiff,
the
petitioner,
to
determine
what
court
he
wants
to
win.
we
went
into
the
court
of
claims.
now
it's
not
suggested
by
the
government
that
we're
in
the
wrong
court
in
that
level.
mr.
david
scribner
well
i
would
say
that
if
there
is
motion
or
if
the
court
did
it
sua
sponte
on
the
ground
of
foreign
inconvenience
for
instance
or
on
some
other
issue,
i
would
imagine
that
it
could
be
done,
but
of
course
that
was
not
what
was
confronting
us.
that
was
not
the
motion
made
by
the
government
and
that
was
not
the
basis
apparently
on
which
the
court
acted
because
it
didn't
say
anything.
the
court
of
claims
said
nothing.
we
assume
the
only
basis
for
that
was
the
--
what
it
is
the
government
told
them.
and
i
think
that's
been
the
posture
of
the
case
to
date
that
it
was
transferred
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
that
it
is
to
be
treated
as
a
suit
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
on
the
admiralty
side
of
the
district
court,
otherwise
this
is
entire
proceeding
would
make
an
offense.
and
i
think
my
--
mr.
david
scribner
--
that
happens
to
--
mr.
david
scribner
[inaudible]
mr.
david
scribner
not
on
this
really.
the
--
i
think
the
general
legislative
history
would
show
that
first
they
don't
intend
it
to
be
fairly
exclusive,
i
have
no
question
about
that.
but
what
it
does
not
show
at
any
time
that
it's
exclusive
as
to
seamen
working
on
the
private
seamen
working
on
government
vessels
or
claims
by
private
individuals
or
corporations
whatever
it
is
against
the
government.
and
--
but
so
far
as
government
employees
is
concerned,
that
is
taking
a
whole
classification
and
covering
them
under
admiralty,
there
isn't
a
word
in
the
legislative
history
that
would
assist
us
one
way
or
the
other.
my
view
is
that
in
the
absence
of
any
direct
approach
for
this
government
problem,
government
employee
problem,
which
is
not
a
small
problem,
in
the
absence
of
any
direct
approach
by
congress,
i
would
say
it
would
be
analogous
to
the
situation
of
federal
employees
claim
act
that
where
the
--
where
there
is
legislation
which
specifically
affects
government
employees
there
has
to
be
a
specific
intent
or
express
intent,
expressed
in
legislation,
of
congress
to
deprive
them
or
to
take
them
out
of
that
general
classification
and
put
them
into
classification
of
seamen
rather
than
government
employee.
we
have
nothing
like
that.
mr.
david
scribner
well
there
were
some
hearings,
there
were
no
hearings
in
relation
to
one
of
the
amendments,
but
by
and
large
there
was
a
tremendous
amount
of
discussion
in
congress
on
these
things,
but
not
a
single
word
that
relates
to
how
you
should
treat
this
whole
body
of
government
employee
or
how
each
of
us
will
handle
that
exactly
in
the
opposite
direction
and
for
different
reasons.
but
i
would
say
it's
a
fair
statement
to
make
that
if
congress
had
intended
to
take
government
employees
out
of
their
class
as
government
employees,
albeit
if
they
were
seamen,
and
put
them
into
a
different
class
seamen
then
they
would've
said
so.
i
just
want
to
wind
up
by
saying
the
following
again,
by
just
repeating
one
thing
which
i
think
is
determinative
at
least
in
my
mind
and
i
hope
will
be
in
yours
and
that
is
that
it
will
make
sense
or
it
does
make
sense
to
put
government
seamen,
government
civil
service
seamen,
in
a
class
with
seamen
and
to
put
them
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
only
if
there
were
issues
which
could
possibly
be
admiralty
issues
under
admiralty
laws.
there
isn't
a
single
principle
of
admiralty
law
that
could
apply
to
the
suits
in
question.
mr.
david
scribner
may
i
have
a
moment?
first,
i'd
like
to
call
to
your
attention
of
what
is
an
obvious
fact
and
that
is
that
the
united
states
did
waive
sovereign
immunity
with
respect
to
suits
by
government
employees
as
early
as
1887
through
the
tucker
act.
and
the
fact
is
that
that
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
continued
from
that
period
of
time
to
date
with
amendments
to
the
tucker
act
constantly
and
as
late
as
august
30,
1964
where
the
congress
took
under
consideration
again
the
entire
question
of
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
respect
to
the
claims
of
government
employees
for
wages
for
compensation
against
the
united
states.
so
that
it
isn't
as
though
in
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
we
suddenly
had
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
under
certain
conditions
which
is
spelled
out
in
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
immunity,
the
waiver
of
immunity
for
government
employees
long
preceded
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
and
as
continued
up
to
date.
now
a
state
--
mr.
david
scribner
it
is
my
position
that
the
court
of
claims
has
exclusive
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
scribner
that's
exactly
right,
sir.
i
will
not
equivocate
on
that,
that's
our
position.
that's
our
view
of
the
situation
that
it
cannot
go
any
place
else
except
where
there's
a
claim
under
$10,000.00
you
would
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
district
court,
and
obviously
on
the
civil
side
not
on
the
admiralty
side
since
the
principles
of
the
government
activity
--
of
the
government
enactments
with
respect
to
government
employees
would
be
involved.
mr.
david
scribner
well,
it
appears
to
me,
although
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
the
--
for
a
determination
in
respect
to
this
matter,
it
appears
to
me
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
congress
to
have
where
admiralty
matters
were
involved,
specific
admiralty
matters
were
involved
that
is
admiralty
law
applies
and
where
the
vessel
would
be
treated
as
though
it
were
a
private
vessel,
government
vessel
treated
as
though
as
private
vessel.
mr.
david
scribner
well
--
mr.
david
scribner
well
in
the
context
of
--
mr.
david
scribner
i'm
sorry.
well
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
applies
to
--
in
its
provisions
appears
to
indicate
that
the
admiralty
courts
that
the
district
courts
in
admiralty
would
apply
it.
it
would
be
somewhat
of
a
nullity,
i
suspect
to
have
the
court
of
claims
apply
admiralty
principles
and
i
think
the
history
of
this
thing
has
fairly
indicated
that
they
would
go
to
the
district
court
admiralty
side.
i
have
never
heard
of
that
happening
the
other
way
around.
now,
where
seamen
had
been
involved,
government
seamen
involved,
the
court
of
claims
has
always
handled
those
matters
up
to
1960
and
certainly
up
to
our
case.
i
think
our
case
was
--
our
cases
were
the
first
few
cases,
a
very
simple
reason
for
that.
there
was
no
prin
--
no
law
of
admiralty
that
was
involved
at
any
time.
there
was
a
question
of
overtime
provisions
as
required
under
the
statutes.
there
was
the
question
of
wages
as
required
by
the
statutes
affecting
government
employees.
there
were
no
particular
principles
of
admiralty
law
at
any
time
of
the
--
mr.
david
scribner
of
course
they
had
certainly,
certainly,
but
under
admiralty
law.
now
when
we
say
that
the
generalization
is
not
helpful
to
us.
the
specific
laws
under
which
he
could
make
his
claim
is
significant.
the
only
way
a
seaman
could
make
his
claim
for
wages
or
for
any
other
activity
would
be
under
title
46
of
the
code.
title
46
of
the
code
spells
out
precisely
in
what
areas
he
can
prevail
or
not
prevail.
whereas
a
government
employee
who's
a
seaman
is
not
governed
by
that
at
all,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
dispute
categorically
and
i
say
there's
absolutely
no
support
for
the
statement
made
by
my
friend
here
a
moment
ago
that
a
government
seaman
could
under
suits
in
admiralty
act
sue
for
unearned
wages.
why,
it
could
be
the
most
revolutionary
concept
i
ever
heard.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i'd
like
to
see
it
on
writing
from
the
solicitor's
office
i
intend
to
ask
--
ask
him
for
a
letter
to
that
effect
after
this
case
is
over.
mr.
david
scribner
i
think
categorically
there
are
absolutely
none.
the
only
statutes
that
were
involved
and
i
know
they'll
agree
because
they
referred
to
title
46,
would
be
title
46
of
the
code
which
relates
to
that
problem.
title
46
of
the
code
relates
to
unearned
wages,
maintenance
and
cure
and
the
like.
a
reference
was
made
a
little
while
ago
to
the
question
of
unearned
wages
that
it
might
conceivably
involve
a
government
seaman
in
a
suit
for
wages
might
conceivably
come
within
the
comforts
of
46.
it
is
absolutely
inaccurate,
he
can
not
come,
there
are
no
articles,
no
government
employee
who
acts
as
a
seaman
cites
on
co-shipping
articles.
the
shipping
articles
spell
out
the
application
of
title
46,
it
spells
out
specifically.
another
thing
that
was
mentioned
was
that
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
government
seaman
would
be
entitled
to
a
month's
pay
because
of
the
scope
of
his
employment
or
the
articles.
that's
under
his
articles.
articles
are
required
under
title
46,
the
interpretation
of
articles
are
requirement
of
title
42.
government
seamen
are
not
covered
by
those
--
mr.
david
scribner
yes
indeed,
there's
a
same
comprehensive
plan
that
we
see
--
that
we
suggest
was
considered
by
this
court
in
johansen-patterson
cases.
mr.
david
scribner
that's
right,
and
in
fact
they
are.
mr.
david
scribner
well
i
think
that's
a
fact.
the
title
46
is
available
to
all
of
us.
it
does
not
apply
to
government
employees
just
as
it
doesn't
apply
to
someone,
a
typist
in
kansas
city
who's
a
government
employee.
it
would
apply
as
little
to
a
kansas
city
typist
who
is
a
government
employee
as
it
would
to
seaman
who
is
employed
by
the
government
in
civil
service
in
the
civil
service
area
on
a
government
vessel.
exactly
there
is
not
difference
insofar
as
the
application
of
admiralty
law
is
concerned.
