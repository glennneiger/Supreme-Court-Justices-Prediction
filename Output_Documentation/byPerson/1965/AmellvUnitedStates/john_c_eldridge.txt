mr.
john
c.
eldridge
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
beginning
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
fortas
asked,
and
that
is
the
ground
of
the
court
of
claims
order.
it
is
my
understanding
that
prior
to
1960,
there
could
be
no
transfer
between
the
court
of
claims
and
the
district
court.
and
when
in
1960,
congress
enacted
what
is
now
28
u.s.c.,
1506,
providing
for
a
transfer
from
the
court
of
claims
to
the
district
court.
it
did
so
on
the
assumption
that
there,
the
legislative
history
clearly
shows
that
prior
to
that
time
there
couldn't
be
such
a
transfer.
and
that
statute
only
provides
for
a
transfer
where
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
is
exclusive.
so
and
that
of
course
would
transfer
provision
we
invoke
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
was
exclusive
in
these
cases.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
court
of
claims
would
have
had
any
power
to
transfer
a
case
cognizable
under
the
tucker
act
or
under
$10,000.00
where
there's
concurrent
jurisdiction.
i
think
the
choice
that
the
plaintiff
--
the
choice
is
completely
of
the
plaintiffs
here.
the
government
has
no
right
to
deprive
the
plaintiff
of
that
choice
under
the
tucker
act.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
i
--
that's
my
understanding,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
what
happened,
it
would
depend
upon
whether
the
seamen
were
employed
upon
merchant
vessels
or
public
vessels,
justice
black.
the
court
of
claims
had
held
prior
to
1960
that
the
public
vessels
act
did
not
encompass
contract
actions
generally,
maritime
contract
actions
and
because
of
that,
if
the
seaman
were
employed
on
public
vessels
prior
to
1960,
we
did
not
move
to
suggest
lack
of
jurisdiction
to
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
now
what
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
that's
right.
now
if
they
were
employed
upon
a
merchant
vessel
and
there
was
no
transfer,
the
court
of
claims
would
dismiss
the
suit
and
it
would
have
to
be
filed
anew
in
the
district
court.
and
of
course
sometimes,
during
that
period
of
time
limitations
would
expire
and
a
new
suit
could
not
be
filed.
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
in
1960,
congress
permitted
transfers,
one
provision
of
the
statute
permitted
a
transfer
from
the
court
of
claims
to
the
district
court,
another
provision
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
claims.
for
example,
where
tucker
act
suit
was
filed
in
the
district
court
or
over
$10,000.00
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
would
be
in
the
court
of
claims.
before
1960
the
case
had
to
be
dismissed
and
then
re-filed
in
the
other
court,
but
now
it
can
be
transferred
and
the
statute
of
limitations
is
--
the
statute
of
limitations
stops
to
run
when
it
was
filed
originally
in
the
wrong
court.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
i
say
the
distinction
depend
whether
they
were
merchant
vessel
or
public
case.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
that's
not
clear
from
the
complaint
but
i
would
assume
they
are
all
public
vessels
involved.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
the
court
of
claims
would
entertain
them
prior
to
1960.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes
your
honor,
because
of
their
holding
and
on
other
line
of
cases
that
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
prior
to
1960,
public
seamen
employed
on
public
vessels,
i
don't
know
how
many
cases
or
but
just
regularly
filed
their
suits
in
the
court
of
claims
and
the
court
of
claims
entertained
such
suits.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
i
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes
that
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes
the
change
of
the
law
--
another
change
of
the
law
was
made
in
1960
justice
black.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes
justice
black.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
the
same
statute
amended
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
so
as
to
encompass
public
vessel
actions
and
which
i
think
we
deal
with.
in
other
words,
section
1
of
that
1960
act
and
section
2
were
the
transfer
provisions.
section
3
of
the
1960
act
deleted
the
limitation
in
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
so
that
the
act
was
confined
to
claims
involving
merchant
vessels.
and
therefore
a
seaman's
wage
claim,
a
seaman
employed
on
a
public
vessel,
his
suit
after
1960
would
be
brought
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
rather
than
the
public
vessels
act.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
this
is
discussed
on
pages
--
beginning
with
page
18
of
our
brief
justice
black.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
through
18
and
19.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
no
i
do
not
think
the
1960
statute
was
discussed.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
section
3
of
that
act
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
--
is
that
section
2
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
quoted
on
page
2
of
our
brief.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
no,
section
3
of
the
1960
statute
was
an
amendment
for
section
2
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
and
see
the
--
before
1960,
there's
been
quite
a
conflict
among
the
courts
as
to
how
to
the
scope
of
the
public
vessels
act.
in
this
court's
opinion
in
calmar
steamship
company
in
346
u.s.,
the
court
refers
to
that
conflict
as
to
whether
the
public
vessels
act
encompass
maritime
contract
actions
or
whether
it
was
just
limited
to
tort
actions
and
actions
involving
towage
and
salvage
which
are
expressly
mentioned.
the
first
circuit
and
the
court
of
claims
and
some
of
the
other
courts
had
held
that
the
public
vessels
act
did
not
encompass
maritime
contract
claims
generally.
and
therefore,
they
would
not
encompass
the
seaman's
wage
action,
the
public
vessels
act
would
not.
the
ninth
circuit
had
held
to
the
contrary.
now,
in
--
so
before
1960
if
the
public
vessels
act
was
narrow,
as
the
court
of
claims
had
held,
then
there
would
be
no
admiralty
statute
encompassing
the
seaman's
wage
claims,
and
therefore
they
could
sue
under
the
tucker
act
because
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
was
confined
to
merchant
vessel
seaman.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
what
they
could
if
the
court
of
claim's
construction
of
the
public
vessels
act
was
correct.
i
think
this
court
had
never
decided
the
question.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
no,
no
because
the
government's
position
was
always
that
the
public
vessels
act
was
quite
narrow
until
we've
lost
several
cases
in
this
court.
american
stevedoring
and
parello
and
the
canadian
aviator.
we
had
used
to
take
the
position
that
although
the
public
vessels
act
encompassed
with
ship
collision
cases
and
this
court
told
us
we
were
wrong.
so
in
light
of
the
government's
old
position
if
it
was
a
public
vessel
act
seaman,
we
would
not
have
asserted
that
there
was
any
admiralty
statute
encompassing
their
claims,
because
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
was
limited
to
merchant
vessel
seaman
and
the
public
vessels
act
we
view
is
quite
narrowly.
but
now
prior
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
now
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
only
public
vessel
seamen,
yes.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
what
congress
has
done
away
with
that
jurisdiction
in
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
as
this
court
held
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes,
when
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well,
when
it
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
in
this
case
it's
not
clear
whether
these
seamen
are
employed
on
public
vessels
or
merchant
vessels.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
one
of
the
reasons
was
because
of
this
very
doubt
involved
as
to
where
jurisdiction
existed
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
congress
in
1960
thought
that
it
was
ending
the
matter.
if
i
could
treat
it
historically,
justice
black,
i
might
be
able
to
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well,
it's
there
if
you'd
bear
with
me
a
moment.
in
1920
when
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
was
passed,
it
had
a
proviso
in
it,
it
was
limited
to
actions
involving
merchant
vessels
of
course.
now
this
court
in
about
1930
in
johnson
v.
fleet
corporation
held,
and
again
in
the
case
of
madison
navigation
company,
held
that
where
a
case
was
cognizable
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
it
could
not
be
brought
under
the
tucker
act.
if
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
had
repealed
the
portion
of
the
tucker
act
which
had
given
--
granted
jurisdic
--
the
court
of
claims
jurisdiction
over
maritime
contract
claims
involving
merchant
vessels.
so,
from
that
time
on,
government
employees
employed
on
merchant
vessels,
their
suits
were
regularly
entertained
in
the
district
courts
sitting
in
admiralty
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
but,
when
in
1925
when
congress
passed
the
public
vessels
act
the
wording
of
the
statute
was
much
narrower,
and
the
dispute
grew
up
among
the
courts
as
to
whether
the
public
vessels
act
encompassed
these
maritime
contract
claims
and
the
court
of
claims
held
that
it
did
not.
this
court
never
resolved
it.
therefore,
there
was
no
--
and
if
that
holding
of
the
court
of
claims
was
correct,
if
you
have
a
seaman
employed
on
a
public
vessel,
there
was
no
basis
for
the
assertion
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
would
be
in
admiralty.
it
was
just
as
to
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
involving
merchant
vessels
that
the
court
of
claims
had
no
jurisdiction
and
that
was
held
by
this
court
in
several
cases
and
it's
in
continually
reaffirmed.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes
justice
white.
in
other
words,
once
the
only
thing
in
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
that
limited
the
operation
of
the
statute
to
merchant
vessels
was
a
proviso
in
section
2
as
it
existed
before
1960
provided
the
vessel
is
employed
as
a
merchant
vessel
and
in
1960,
congress
made
several
changes
and
that
was
one.
it
eliminated
that
proviso.
it
added
the
language
of
a
private
person
or
property
was
involved.
instead
of
a
liable
in
admiralty,
it
added
--
it
added
the
language
any
appropriate
non-jury
proceeding
can
be
brought
against
the
united
states
to
make
it
clear
that
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
the
district
court
can
sit
on
its
law
side.
and
the
reports,
the
committee
reports
which
we
refer
to
and
quote
from
in
our
brief
â€œmake
it
clear
that
congress
wanted
to
do
a
way
with
this
doubt
as
to
the
scope
of
the
public
vessels
act.
and
for
purposes
of
suing
the
government
wanted
to
do
a
way
with
the
distinction
between
merchant
vessels
and
public
vessels
and
have
all
these
claims
against
the
government
brought
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
and
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
i
think
in
the
committee
reports
which
we
do
cite
in
our
brief
refer
to
the
testimony
before
the
committee.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
the
amendment
to
was
not
--
was
instigated
by
the
maritime
law
association.
the
admiralty
lawyers
were
discouraged
about
this
doubt
that
they
--
when
they
had
a
public
vessel
act
seamen,
they
were
never
sure
whether
jurisdiction
was
in
the
district
courts
in
admiralty
or
in
the
court
of
claims.
and
if
it
was
a
merchant
vessel
rather
than
a
public
vessel
involved,
and
if
they
had
to,
and
if
their
suit
was
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
court
would
dismiss
their
suit
because
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
was
in
the
district
courts
and
it
was
just
a
general
problem
of
where
to
file
these
suits
because
it's
very
difficult
to
determine
whether
a
vessel
is
merchant
or
public
and
it
was
also
where
there
was
a
conflict
among
the
courts.
it
was
difficult
to
know
what
a
particular
court
would
say
about
the
public
vessels
act.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
so
this
was
the
testimony
which
the
committee
refers
to.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
and
the
committee
said
and
the
committee
pointed
to
all
the
various
cases,
and
said
that
we
were
--
that
we
want
to
rectify
it,
so
the
bill
in
the
house
contain
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes
that's
quoted
in
our
brief,
some
of
the
language
from
the
committee
report.
i
don't
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes
we
have
one
quote
on
page
--
middle
page
19
from
the
committee
reports.
i
don't
think
the
brief
goes
into
this
background
as
much.
so
the
bill
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
we
think
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
does
repeal
it
and
it
was
just
by
bringing
these
seamen
into
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
that
you
deprive
them
of
any
remedy
under
the
tucker
act.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
this
was
the
holding
of
this
court
in
several
cases
that
if
a
litigant
could
sue
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
he
could
not
sue
under
the
tucker
act
and
i
think
the
whole
framework
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
and
the
history
of
the
act
shows
that
this
court's
decisions
were
correct
to
that
effect.
in
other
words,
in
19
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
the
admiralty
bar
wanted
to
clarify.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
i
think
in
the
one
area
of
the
public
vessel
seamen
where
it
was
a
maritime
claim,
the
admiralty
bar
wanted
this
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
i
think
the
admiralty
bar
was
more
concerned
about
the
confusion
that
existed
but
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
the
maritime
law
association
proposed
the
bill
and
as
i
started
to
say
before,
it
just
contained
the
transfer
provisions
when
it
was
in
the
house.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes,
we
had
really
nothing
to
do
with
drafting
it.
then
after
the
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes,
the
first
two
sections
are
just
the
transfer
provisions
in
the
house
then
we
were
asked
to
comment
on
the
bill.
and
the
department
of
justice
and
the
department
of
commerce
suggested
that
in
addition
to
providing
for
the
transfers,
the
jurisdictional
question
ought
to
be
clarified
so
that
you
don't
have
many
misfiled
suits
in
the
future
and
then
the
maritime
law
association
agreed
to
this
and
the
--
and
i
think
the
department
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
we
suggested
that
it
ought
to
be
done.
the
department
of
commerce
then
drafted
section
3
of
the
60
statute,
which
is
now
section
2
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act,
and
they
inserted
the
words
or
if
a
private
person
or
property
were
involved.
and
i
think
the
words
instead
of
an
admiralty
preceding
any
appropriate
non-jury
proceeding.
then
the
committee
--
the
senate
committee
outlines
what
happened.
it
was
sent
to
the
maritime
law
association
and
the
maritime
law
association
then
suggested
that
we
delete
the
merchant
vessel
limitation
and
have
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
encompass
all
government
vessels.
the
department
of
justice
was
then
asked
to
comment
upon
that
and
we
agreed
to
it.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes
justice
white,
that's
i
suppose
what
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
did
and
the
whole
object
was
to
have
all
maritime
claims
embraced
within
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
i
think
that
this
quote
on
--
the
committee
reports
i
think
state
that
in
this
quote
we
have
set
forth
on
page
19
of
our
brief,
justice
black.
section
2
restates
in
brief
and
simple
language,
the
now
existing
exclusive
jurisdiction
conferred
on
the
district
courts
both
on
the
admiralty
and
law
sides
over
cases
against
the
united
states
which
could
be
sued
on
in
admiralty
if
private
vessels,
persons
or
property
were
involved.
i
think
this
states
the
portion
we
quote
precisely
--
precisely
what
we're
arguing.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes,
justice
black.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
no,
suits
in
admiralty
act.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
how
that
1960
legislation
evolved.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
maritime
law
association.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
department
of
justice
and
the
department
of
commerce,
yes.
and
the
whole
purpose
was
to
clarify
the
confusion
that
had
existed
before.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
to
settle
the
question,
yes.
that
he
didn't
have
to
worry
about
whether
the
public
vessels
act
encompassed
contract
claims.
you'd
now
suit
under
section
2
of
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
and
it
embraced
all
maritime
claims.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
--
the
word
exclusive
is
right
in
the
second
sentence
of
this
quote
justice
black.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes
on
this
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
--
only
public
--
not
when
it
came
to
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
if
it
was
a
merchant
vessel
seaman
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
the
kind
of
suit
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
--
they
have
that
it
was
a
--
we
don't
know
whether
there
are
clients
or
merchant
vessel
or
public
vessel
because
after
1960
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
(voice
overlap)
and
i
suppose
they
did
not
feel
any
need
to
allege
one
or
the
other.
the
reason
that
we
haven't
detailed
this
more
in
our
brief,
i
don't
think
the
petitioners
have
ever
raised
any
question
that
the
effect
of
the
1960
amendment
was
to
do
away
with
the
merchant
vessel
--
public
vessel
distinction
in
this
area
and
to
bring
all
these
cases
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
they
just
argued
it's
not
embraced
by
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
this
is
why
the
petitioner
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
--
the
petitioners
are
conceding,
if
i
understand
their
argument
although
the
national
maritime
union
isn't
here
that
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
is
exclusive
as
the
case
comes
under
it.
and
their
whole
argument
is
that
government
employed
seaman's
wage
claim
is
not
embraced
by
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
they
concede
that
there's
no
concurrent
jurisdiction
if
i
understand
their
argument.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
no,
i
--
well
that's
a
good
question
justice
white,
we
have
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
we
have
our
fleet
of
public
vessels
operated
under
operating
agency
agreements
and
there's
a
dispute
as
to
whose
employees
they
are
whether
they're
ours
or
the
operating
agents
right
now.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes,
because
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes
justice
white.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
he's
arguing
that
his
--
these
government
employees
are
not
encompassed
by
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well,
he's
relying
on
--
on
this
--
this
court's
decisions
in
johansen
and
patterson
quoting
that
the
suits
that
you
couldn't
--
a
government
employee
couldn't
sue
for
personal
injuries
because
though
he
shouldn't
have
a
dole
remedy,
it
was
covered
by
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
and
this
court
held
that
we
don't
think
that
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
--
there
would
be
a
dual
remedy
for
personal
injury.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
no,
that's
what
i
say
--
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
well
petitioner's
argument
is
that
a
government
employee
seaman's
wage
claim
is
not
encompassed
by
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
as
i
understand
it.
and
we
think
that
first
the
clear
language
of
the
statute
encompass
it
because
it
says
if
the
government
were
private
and
if
the
proceeding
would
be
--
could
be
maintained
in
admiralty,
and
a
proceeding
can
be
brought
against
the
government.
certainly
if
the
government
were
private
ship
operator
or
owner
its
employees'
claims,
wage
claims
would
be
in
admiralty.
this
is
well
settled,
it's
been
settled
since
the
earliest
days
in
this
country.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
yes
and
here
of
course
this
court
in
johansen
and
patterson
held
that
as
between
the
compensation
act
and
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
both
of
which
the
language
covers
the
claim,
exclusive
jurisdiction
should
be
under
the
compensation
act.
but
when
it
comes
to
between
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
and
the
tucker
act,
this
court
held
in
several
cases
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
and
congress
has
legislated
with
reference
to
that
on
several
occasions
as
set
forth
in
our
brief,
has
accepted
that
holding
--
those
holdings,
and
we
do
think
that
they
have
become
part
of
the
framework
of
the
statute.
that
on
all
maritime
claims
now
jurisdiction
is
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
so
we
do
submit
that
these
are
seaman's
wage
claims
and
if
we
make
a
final
point,
petitioner
argues
that
in
this
type
of
case,
a
pure
admiralty
issue
can
not
come
up,
i
suggest
it
can.
now,
suppose
one
of
mr.
scribner's
clients
was
discharged
before
he
had
earned
the
month's
wages
and
was
suing
for
his
wages.
under
the
decisions
of
the
court
he
would
be
entitled
to
his
earned
wages
plus
another,
an
extra
month's
wages
under
46
u.s.c.
594,
which
has
been
applied
to
the
government
repeatedly.
there
could
be
other
maritime
issues
and
we
do
think
that
a
complaint
is
made
about
watches
on
ships,
one
of
the
very
cases
here.
this
is
the
matter
which
the
district
court
sitting
in
admiralty
are
experienced
and
not
the
court
of
claims.
they
apply
to
seaman's
wage
statutes.
now,
it
may
be
that
none
of
the
seaman's
wage
statutes
are
applicable
to
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
although
that's
not
clear
either,
because
this
court
reserved
the
question
in
mccrea
versus
united
states
in
294
u.s.
while
the
government
is
subject
to
the
double
wage
penalty
and
the
seaman's
wage
statute
were
not
paying
wages
when
it's
supposed
to,
and
that's
an
unsettled
question.
if
we
are
subject
to
that
then
his
clients,
i
would
assume,
get
double
wages.
and
that
is
purely
a
maritime
issue
that's
a
part
of
the
seaman's
wage
statute.
and
of
course
we
think
we
point
out
that
though
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
is
a
shorter
period
of
limitations,
there
are
nevertheless
other
advantages.
they
get
much
greater
interest.
they're
successful.
it's
the
only
statute
where
the
kind
of
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
to
my
knowledge
in
permitting
you
to
maintain
acts
against
the
united
states
where
you
can
get
pre-judgment
interest
then
get
cost
generally.
it's
the
only
statute
i
know
of
where
you
can
sue
the
united
states
and
can
collect
cost,
the
same
cost
a
private
person
can
invoke
with
tucker
act,
the
court
of
claims
act,
others
have
limitations
on
the
cost.
if
they
would
have
a
seaman's
wage
claim
over
$10,000.00
which
may
be
rare,
they
have
greater
venue.
so
we
do
think
that
it's
not
all
a
one
sided
thing
and
just
the
government
here
trying
to
deprive
these
people
of
the
benefit
of
a
longer
period
of
limitations.
and
as
we
also
point
out
in
our
brief,
it's
not
clear
that
any
of
these
claims
would
be
time
barred
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
mr.
john
c.
eldridge
barred
by
the
two-year
period
of
limitation.
we
point
out
that
a
majority
of
them
clearly
would
not
be
because
67
of
the
petitioners
are
suing.
they
filed
suit
in
november
of
1964
for
a
3.5%
wage
increases
which
a
private
seaman
got
in
june
of
1962
and
june
of
1963.
so
that's
a
period
covering
two
years
five
months.
so
certainly
two
years
of
those
which
are
the
majority
of
those
claims
where
the
claims
of
67
of
the
90
some
petitioners
are
timely.
and
depending
upon
how
the
district
court's
role
on
these
cases
on
the
tolling
issue
whether
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
limitation
provisions
is
tolled
during
the
pendency
of
administrative
proceedings,
they
all
could
be
timely.
but
our
concern
is
not
to
deprive
these
people
of
their
claims
because
of
a
short
period
of
limitation,
but
we,
the
government
does
think
that
in
this
type
of
suit
admiralty
issues
can
be
involved
that
congress
contemplated,
that
maritime
claims
should
be
heard
by
district
courts
including
in
admiralty,
that's
what
this
court
has
held
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
transfer
order
should
be
affirmed.
