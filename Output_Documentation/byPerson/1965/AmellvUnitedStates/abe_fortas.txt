justice
abe
fortas
mr.
scribner,
is
it
entirely
clear
that
apart
from
whether
the
--
which
act
applies
that
the
district
court
does
not
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims
here?
let
me
be
specific
about
my
question.
does
the
provision
relating
to
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
claims
apply
to
the
amount
of
the
individual
claim
or
the
aggregate?
justice
abe
fortas
well
that's
not
--
but
that's
not
showing
anything
before
us,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
look
at
the
record
here,
your
complaint
merely
has
an
aggregate
figure
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
excess
of
$100,000.00.
what
bothers
me
too
is
the
fact
that
--
well
let
me
see
if
i
understand
this.
the
government's
motion
to
dismiss
or
any
alternative
to
transfer
this
file
on
the
court
of
claims.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
motion
was
based
on
the
proposition
that
admiralty
jurisdiction
applies,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
order
entered
by
the
court
of
claims
as
i
understand
it
is
merely
a
general
order
transferring
the
case
to
the
united
states
district
court
without
any
specification,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
question
that
occurs
to
me
is,
it
bothers
me,
is
a
possibility
that
if
the
district
court
has
concurrent
jurisdiction
or
rather
--
yes
if
the
district
court
has
concurrent
jurisdiction
that
order,
now
with
the
court
of
claims,
is
it
possible
that
that
order
as
such
was
not
erroneous?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
what
i'd
--
that's
what
i'd
like
your
help
on
because
it's
obviously
significant
with
respect
to
our
action
here.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
the
--
is
the
petitioner's
choice
conclusive
here?
let's
suppose
that
the
case
is
filed
int
the
court
of
claims
where
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction.
would
it
be
an
error
for
the
court
of
claims
to
transfer
that
case
to
the
district
court
there
being
concurrent
jurisdiction?
justice
abe
fortas
well
certain
other
things
have
concerns
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
it
may
be
a
fact
of
life.
justice
abe
fortas
nor
does
the
court
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
scribner,
mr.
eldridge
referred
to
certain
seaman's
wage
statutes
as
possibly
applicable
in
some
of
these
cases
brought
by
government
employees
for
wage
claims.
do
you
agree
that
there
are
some
seaman's
wage
statutes
that
ordinarily
administered
by
the
district
courts
in
admiralty
which
might
be
important
in
a
--
an
action
by
somebody
like
your
plaintiffs?
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me,
but
this
is
important
to
me.
what
you
are
saying
to
us
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
scheme
of
law
applicable
to
seaman
for
a
government
employee
is
separate
and
isolated
from
the
scheme
of
laws
that
are
--
is
applicable
to
actions
by
seamen
who
are
private
employees.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
they're
totally
separate.
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
i
understand
mr.
eldridge
he
contests
that
statement.
