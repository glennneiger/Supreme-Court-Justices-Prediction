justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
the
government
want
to
change
it?
why
does
the
government
want
them
tried
in
the
other
courts?
what
is
the
real
reason?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
position
that
the
only
difference
and
result
that
could
happen
in
this
case
bar
the
principles
of
law
since
that
here
that
in
one
the
government
concedes
the
statute
of
limitation
and
the
other
one
it
could
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
there
any
other
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
has
happened
to
the
cases
filed
in
the
court
of
claims
prior
to
1960
of
this
nature?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
understood
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
understood
you
couldn't
move
to
transfer
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
then
from
what
you
say,
prior
to
1960
there
had
been
no
cases
of
this
kind
like
these
people
have
filed
for
wages
tried
in
the
court
of
claims
that
all
had
been
dismissed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i'm
talking
--
what
were
these?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
to
cases
the
way
it
suits
the
wages?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
did
they
continue?
had
they
entertained
them
without
objection
on
the
part
of
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
whatever
it
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
how
long
have
they
been
tried
there
that
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
do
you
claim
that
when
they
arranged
for
them
to
be
transferred
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
the
other
court
that
also
made
it
impossible
for
them
to
--
court
of
claims
to
try
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
act
change
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
deprived
the
court
of
claims
of
jurisdiction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that?
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
find
section
1
and
2
and
5,
but
i
don't
find
section
3
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
18.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
in
the
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
act
--
section
3
quoted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
only
what
you
rely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh!
section
2.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
say
that
the
congress
changed
this
long
rule,
as
i
understood
you,
the
long
rule
by
section
2
so
that
the
--
before
section
2
was
adopted
they
could
sue
for
wages
in
court
of
claims
but
after
it
they
could
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
are
you
claiming
that
the
law
was
always
wrong
when
they
sued
there
that
if
had
been
properly
raised
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
you
these
questions,
i
know
nothing
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
no
view
on
it
at
all,
but
i'm
wondering
why
if
this
had
been
the
practice
if
they
could
sue
for
wages
in
that
court
before
1960.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
this
kind
of
case,
in
that
was
the
case,
why
would
they
have
done
away
with
that
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims
without
saying
something
about
it
and
decide?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
they
have
done
it
by
indirection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
1960?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
these
particular
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
type
of
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
not
clear,
we
can
assume
that
is
a
kind
of
case
which
this
court
had
always
had
jurisdiction
without
objection
by
the
government.
now
why
would
congress
have
changed
that
indirectly
without
mentioning
it
so
that
we
have
to
work
it
out
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
have
been
all
the
more
necessary
of
the
whether
they
know
what
they're
talking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
alright,
but
i
want
to
first
treat
it
from
the
language
of
what
we
are
supposed
to
construe
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
find
out
where
we
can
find
anything
there
that
tells
us
that
this
long
standing
jurisdiction
has
been
abolished.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
you've
done
that?
why
did
you
follow?
why
would
you
give
a
litigant
arrest
suit
in
another
court
in
another
place
takes
away
as
filed
right
pursuing
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
admiralty
bar
or
whoever
it
was
suggested
this
law
suggest
that
they
take
the
jurisdiction
away
from
the
court
of
claims?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
suggest
to
take
away
to
â€“
bar
the
jurisdiction
in
the
previous
for
the
next
side
and
the
court
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
you
say
wanted,
now
can
we
see
where
they
suggested
it
as
the
part
of
the
history
of
this
act
that
the
jurisdiction
be
taken
away
from
the
court
of
claims?
is
there
any
place
to
which
you
can
cite
us,
any
record
of
any
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
where
--
where
can
we
find
that
in
the
history
of
this
act
that
they
intended
to
take
away
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
claims
invested
all
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
talking
about
that
part
on
page
19?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
been
unable
to
find
here,
i'm
sure
it's
my
fault,
quotation
where
you
said
they
stated
that
they
wanted
to
confer
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
try
these
cases
in
this
other
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
exclusive
jurisdiction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
now
exclusive
jurisdiction
conferred
on
the
district
court
but
there
was
no
exclusive
jurisdiction
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
they
have
been
trying
them
in
the
court
of
claims.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
this
kind
of
suit
they
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all
we
understood
in
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
be
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
--
do
you
claim
that
the
court
of
claims
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
or
the
district
court
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
these
claims
for
wages,
either
one
of
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
exclusive?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
claim
it
exclusive?
