mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
we're
not
clear
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
we're
not
clear
mr.
justice
whether
that
will
be
construed
as
mr.
justice
white
suggests
only
as
prohibiting
us
from
entering
into
an
agreement
not
to
carry
conflicting
line
but
permitting
us
to
say
to
our
dealers,
“if
you
will
carry
an
adequate
and
a
representative
stock
of
our
shoes.
we
will
get
you
these
services
as
long
as
you
do
so.”
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
that
is
a
--
that
is
a
troublesome
thing.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
and
understanding,
is
there
an
implied
understanding
there
that
we
are
not
acquainted
with.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
that
is
our
concern.
it
might
be
interpreted
that
way.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
it
is
a
practical
matter
you
cannot
do
it,
a
small
store.
now,
a
large
department
store,
for
example,
where
there's
a
great
volume
they
can
carry
many
conflicting
lines,
several,
perhaps.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
focuses
on
this
question?
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
that
is
not
said
your
honor,
but
it
does
say
that
where
the
effect
of
it
is
to
protrude
in
from
independently
determining
whether
they'll
be
shoes
would
be
purchased
from
the
competitor.
now,
the
commission
is
contending
that
that
is
what
is
the
effect
of
our
present
plan
as
it
is
now
being
operated.
and
the
record
shows
that
five
out
of
six
of
every
one
of
these
dealers,
five
out
of
six
of
573
actually
were
carrying
conflicting
shoes,
not
lines
but
conflicting
shoes
without
objection.
and
the
testimony
shows,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
it
keeps
them
from
carrying
a
conflicting
line
as
a
practical
matter,
practical
economic
matter.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
no.
we
say,
if
your
honor
please,
we
are
not
interfering
with
their
independent
judgment.
we're
saying
that
so
long
as
you'll
concentrate
on
our
lines,
we'll
give
you
these
benefits.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
they
--
they
feel
that
if
you
offer
services
here
which
they're
admittedly
needed
and
they
want
them,
they
free
to
lay
the
plan
in
any
way
it's
an
inducement,
but
they're
offering
this
extra
aids
and
extra
benefits
and
what
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
think
that
is
correct.
they
say
this
is
an
exclusive
dealing
agreement
or
if
it
is
not
strictly
speaking
an
exclusive
dealing
agreement
that
it's
--
of
a
type
equivalent
to
an
exclusive
dealing
agreement
which
prohibits
the
dealers
from
buying
shoes
of
other
people.
now,
the
commission
as
i
see
it
has
shifted
its
ground
on
this
many
times.
this
case
was
started
as
strictly
a
section
3
case.
it
was
tried
on
that
case.
the
hearing
examiner
decided
it
on
that
case,
on
that
theory,
but
then
when
he
undertook
to
determine
the
substantiality
of
the
effect,
he
said,
“if
you
measure
this
against
the
national
market
it
won't
be
substantial.
therefore,
i
will
measure
it
against
the
market
represented
only
by
these
stores,
the
area
in
which
they
do
their
retail
--
have
their
retail
businesses.”
now,
the
commission
came
along
and
found
it
was
substantial.
the
commission
came
along
and
said,
“no,
that's
for
long”
and
struck
out
those
findings
and
substituted
it's
own.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
section
3
was
not
used,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
it
was
not
mentioned
by
then.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
complained
under
section
5
charging
exclusive
dealing
and
substantial
effect.
at
conclusion
of
the
hearings
which
lasted
a
year
--
a
year
and
a
half,
the
trial
examiner,
the
hearing
examiner
considered
it
was
a
section
3
case
and
so
stated.
he
decided
as
i
say
on
the
theory
that
he
had
defined
substantial
effects
upon
competition
as
you
do
under
section
3,
but
the
commission
struck
out
those
findings
because
the
retail
limits
were
not
the
correct
limits
of
the
relevant
market
and
said,
“we
find
that
to
violate
section
5,
it's
akin
to
a
tie-in
arrangement.
then
having
found
that
akin
to
a
tie-in
arrangement,
the
commission
considered
our
contention.
no
you
have
to
measure
it
against
the
effect
upon
the
competition
and
said
that
that's
immaterial
and
reiterated
again.
we
find
it
violates
section
4
but
added
in
any
event
in
fact
and
i'm
not
quoting
the
exact
words
that
in
any
effect
we
find
that
the
competitor's
standards
had
been
met.
now
before
the
court
of
appeals,
the
argument
of
the
commission
was
this
is
akin
to
a
tie-in
arrangement
and
they
cited
northern
pacific
and
half
a
dozen
other
cases
and
the
court
of
appeals
analyzed
those
cases
distinguished
them
and
said,
“no,
it's
not
akin
to
tie-in
arrangement.”
now
in
the
brief
filed
here,
the
word
tie-in
only
appears
twice
and
as
i
understand
that
the
commission
has
abandoned
the
tie-in
theory
and
as
i
understood
the
counsel
to
say
their
position
is
that
the
standards
of
section
3
is
met
namely
the
substantial
effect
upon
competition
and
we
do
rely
upon
tamper,
tamper
was
a
20-year
prohibition,
20-year
exclusive
dealing
or
requirements
contract
affecting
a
little
less
than
1%
of
the
market.
here
is
an
agreement
that's
terminable
at
will.
the
market
is
not
foreclosed
to
these
other
dealers
and
they
actually
are
selling
in
this
market.
they're
selling
door
stores
not
as
much
as
they
would
like
to
sell
and
we
don't
sell
as
much
as
we
would
like
to
sell,
but
they're
actually
selling
in
it.
the
foreclosure
here
is
only
temporary.
when
anyone
buys,
if
i
would
buy
a
pair
of
shoes
not
much
of
the
market
is
foreclosed
and
preempted
until
they
wear
out
and
need
another
one.
whenever
a
dealer
buys
his
fall
stock
or
his
winter
stock
or
his
spring
stock
that
market
is
preempted
agreement
or
no
preempted
and
when
he
comes
to
replace
that
he
can
buy
those
shoes
from
anyone
he
sees
fit.
if
he
persists
in
buying
a
conflicting
line
and
dividing
his
forces
so
that
he
cannot
operate
an
efficient
and
prosperous
store,
we
do
terminating
rarely
but
occasionally
we
do
more
often
than
we
would
like
to
and
these
services
which
we
give
the
dealers
are
beneficial.
the
record
shows
that
these
dealers
hated
by
our
advice
of
our
servicemen,
of
our
field
men,
their
rate
of
return
is
16%
on
their
investment
on
the
average
compared
to
an
industry
rate
of
return
11.5%,
35%
more.
and
if
any
true
words
were
spoken
in
this
case
whereby
one
of
these
manufacturer
witnesses
that
the
commission
put
on
in
this
agreement
when
he
said
dealers
need
these
services.
now,
we
can't
in
the
first
place
afford
to
give
services
unless
there's
a
comparable
volume
to
sustain
this
expense
nor
can
we
give
services
that
are
worth
having
to
tell
a
dealer
how
to
merchandize
another
line
of
shoes.
for
us,
to
try
to
tell
the
dealer
how
to
merchandize
an
international
shoe
brand
of
shoe
or
some
other
brand
shoe,
we
don't
know
their
patterns.
we
are
not
familiar
with
how
they
perform.
we
don't
know
their
key
quoted
numbers.
the
only
way
we
can
tell
what
they
are
is
to
go
look
in
the
box
and
see
what
the
shoe
is
like.
our
servicemen
or
field
men
are
familiar
with
our
patterns.
they
know
how
they're
performing.
they
can
advice
these
dealers
on
purchases
and
upon
merchandising.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
these
field
men,
these
services
which
are
of
so
great
value.
they're
paid
on
a
salary
basis.
they
have
no
incentive
to
force
shoes
on
these
dealers.
their
success
is
measured
by
the
dealer's
success.
he
runs
a
prosperous
store
and
is
successful,
they're
successful.
the
salesmen
of
course
were
working
on
a
commission
and
have
an
interest
to
sell
all
the
shoes
they
can
while
these
field
men
of
course
want
them
to
concentrate
on
brown
lines.
they
don't
go
out
there
and
urge
them
to
concentrate
on
someone
else's
lines.
they
are
there
to
help
these
--
these
retail
dealers
to
help
them
survive
and
help
them
prosper
and
the
services
of
company
just
that
very
purpose.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
mr.
justice,
the
record
shows
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
most
of
these
benefits
and
services
which
have
been
mentioned
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
oh,
architectural
services
and
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
architectural
sir.
help
them
to
design
a
store,
remodel
a
new
store,
to
design
a
new
front,
display
services
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
help
them
--
help
them
to
display.
they're
listed
specifically
here
on
page
12
and
13
of
the
record.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
as
long
as
they
keep
them
waiting
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
that
is
--
that
is
correct
your
honor,
if
you
please,
unless
there
are
anti
competitive
effects
of
that
act.
now,
the
commission
found
that
it's
always
akin
to
a
tie-in
clause
an
inherently
after
that.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
unless
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
unless
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
well,
i
think
it
is
agreed
that
an
exclusive
dealing
agreement
or
a
requirements
agreement
is
not
illegal
per
se.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
well,
if
it
has
the
requisite
effects
to
substantially
lessen
competition.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
not
per
se.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
not
illegal
per
se.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
no,
i
don't
think
i
am
saying
that.
i
say
it
is
not
illegal
unless
it
is
--
it
has
it
and
anti
competitive
effects.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
substantial
effects
upon
competition
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
and
it
was
the
commission
who
sought
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
finding
that
said,
they're
akin
to
a
tie-in
clause
where
you
don't
have
to
find
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
think
the
consanguinity
is
so
remote
that
it
is
not.
now,
this
court
of
course
in
atlantic
refining
held
that
that
was
akin
to
or
have
the
effect
of
a
tie-in
clause,
although,
it
was
not
strictly
speaking,
a
tie-in
clause
arrangement,
but
there
you
had
a
situation
where
there
was
coercion,
where
there
was
appraisal,
where
there
was
the
use
of
economic
power
in
one
market
to
coerce
the
dealers
in
another
market.
these
services
which
we
rendered
we
have
no
leverage
over,
no
power
over,
they're
not
unique,
they're
offered
by
many
other
dealers,
and
the
commission
has
stipulated
not
just
that
these
large
companies
in
general
and
international
and
the
like
have
these
plans
but
that
virtually
all,
virtually
all
of
the
manufacturers
in
competition
with
us
offer
some
or
all
of
the
following
services
and
among
those
you
will
find
this
service
of
advice
to
business
advice
including
the
advise
on
proper
methods
of
merchandising.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
yes,
very
valuable
advice
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
and
i
think
then
we
would
have
the
effect
of
the
quantity
discount
and
if
it
could
be
justified
that
it's
perfectly
legal
to
give
as
long
as
it
is
not
offered
discriminatory
and
there's
no
evidence
of
that
here.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
don't
think
that
one
your
honor,
(2)
(d)
never
came
into
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
two,
there
is
no
evidence
that
these
services
were
ever
denied
to
a
single
dealer.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
think
that
(2)
(d)
has
to
make
--
the
service
have
to
make
whatever
you're
offering
available
to
the
--
you
don't
have
to
get
them
to
accept.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
now,
we're
trying
to
get
these
people
to
go
on
the
plan.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
everybody
who
could
qualify
on
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
they
are
required
under
these
programs
as
you
see
it
or
operate
--
to
have
adequate
capital
to
operate
a
modern
and
up
to
date
store
to
follow
the
accounting
plans
and
make
the
reports.
it's
not
just
a
one-way
street.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
and
we're
trying
to
get
them
to
go
on
the
plan.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
no
evidence
to
that
but
i'm
sure
that
if
that
had
been
asked,
the
answer
would
have
been
no.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
my
understanding
is
that
it
has
to
be
offered
to
everyone
on
the
same
classification
or
everyone
on
the
same
rule.
we
don't
have
to
classify
all
of
your
customers
the
same
way.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
so
there
is
some
practicality
there,
you
can't
do
it
in
a
discriminatory
way.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
it
is
not
available
to
anyone
who
--
basically
this
is
offered
to
the
family
shoe
stores,
to
the
people
who
carry
the
three
lines
of
shoes,
men's,
women
and
children.
now
there
are
exceptions.
there
are
few
instances,
very
few
instances
where
for
some
reason
or
another
a
store
may
carry
just
for
example
women's
and
children
shoes
but
their
volume
is
sufficient
to
justify
and
it's
offered
to
them,
but
it's
not
offered
to
the
store
who
carries
just
a
few
pair
of
shoes,
a
few
--
odd
lots
of
brown
shoes
or
even
a
single
line
of
brown
shoes
generally
speaking.
it
is
only
offered
to
those
who
concentrate
on
all
three
lines
of
brown
shoes.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
it
is
--
the
figure
of
1%
is
simply
an
entire
shoe
outlets
and
we're
simply
measuring,
these
are
not
open
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
the
program
is
not
--
the
program
is
not
open.
i
think
the
1%
is
used,
your
honor,
in
connection
with
the
volume
of
the
shoe
business
that
is
affected
by
this
anti
competitive
effects.
it
is
the
total
numbers
of
shoe
store.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
incidentally
as
to
the
total
mark.
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
as
the
total
volume
of
shoe
sales
in
dollars
at
retail
or
at
wholesale.
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
but
you're
simply
using
the
number
stores
as
a
possible
yardstick
to
measure
that.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
well,
i
don't
know
that
i
would
characterize
it
just
that
way,
but
we
do
only
offer
it
and
i
think
you
find
that
statement
made
in
our
brochure
that
it's
offered
only
to
the
aggressive
modern
up-to-date
progressive
dealer
who
wants
to
move
ahead
and
something
to
that
effect
in
finding.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
in
lieu
of
the
--
that
i
don't
believe
i
hope
to
answer
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
well,
the
commission
is
suggesting,
but
why
don't
you
just
charge
the
people.
why
don't
you
say,
‘we'll
get
the
advisory
services
for
a
fee?”
but
as
i
attempted
to
point
out,
our
services
would
be
of
no
value
in
trying
to
advise
on
other
people's
shoes
that
little
had
no
value,
we
could
keep
some
records
perhaps
but
it's
not
practical
to
do
that.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
and
the
dealers
would
not
pay
a
dime
for
those
services.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
we
like
to
--
we
like
to,
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
fortas
who
asked
whether
or
not
these
dealers
were
able
to
sell
their
shoes
at
a
cheaper
price
because
of
this
and
there's
nothing
of
that
sort
of
the
record.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
what
they're
doing
before
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
don't
know
that
those
services
were
available
or
paid
anytime
of
any
place.
they
do
get
these
services.
we
think
the
services
are
valuable
and
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
no
question
about
it
your
honor.
no
question
about
it.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
no.
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not
connected.
this
particular
program
or
predecessor
of
this
program
goes
back
to
1921.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
no.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
no,
that's
a
different
(voice
overlap)
this
is
a
different
brown.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
it's
a
different
brown.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
no.
they're
still
in
business?
they
are
not.
your
honor,
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
we're
not
clear
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
we're
not
clear
mr.
justice
whether
that
will
be
construed
as
mr.
justice
white
suggests
only
as
prohibiting
us
from
entering
into
an
agreement
not
to
carry
conflicting
line
but
permitting
us
to
say
to
our
dealers,
“if
you
will
carry
an
adequate
and
a
representative
stock
of
our
shoes.
we
will
get
you
these
services
as
long
as
you
do
so.”
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
that
is
a
--
that
is
a
troublesome
thing.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
and
understanding,
is
there
an
implied
understanding
there
that
we
are
not
acquainted
with.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
that
is
our
concern.
it
might
be
interpreted
that
way.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
it
is
a
practical
matter
you
cannot
do
it,
a
small
store.
now,
a
large
department
store,
for
example,
where
there's
a
great
volume
they
can
carry
many
conflicting
lines,
several,
perhaps.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
focuses
on
this
question?
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
that
is
not
said
your
honor,
but
it
does
say
that
where
the
effect
of
it
is
to
protrude
in
from
independently
determining
whether
they'll
be
shoes
would
be
purchased
from
the
competitor.
now,
the
commission
is
contending
that
that
is
what
is
the
effect
of
our
present
plan
as
it
is
now
being
operated.
and
the
record
shows
that
five
out
of
six
of
every
one
of
these
dealers,
five
out
of
six
of
573
actually
were
carrying
conflicting
shoes,
not
lines
but
conflicting
shoes
without
objection.
and
the
testimony
shows,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
it
keeps
them
from
carrying
a
conflicting
line
as
a
practical
matter,
practical
economic
matter.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
no.
we
say,
if
your
honor
please,
we
are
not
interfering
with
their
independent
judgment.
we're
saying
that
so
long
as
you'll
concentrate
on
our
lines,
we'll
give
you
these
benefits.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
they
--
they
feel
that
if
you
offer
services
here
which
they're
admittedly
needed
and
they
want
them,
they
free
to
lay
the
plan
in
any
way
it's
an
inducement,
but
they're
offering
this
extra
aids
and
extra
benefits
and
what
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
think
that
is
correct.
they
say
this
is
an
exclusive
dealing
agreement
or
if
it
is
not
strictly
speaking
an
exclusive
dealing
agreement
that
it's
--
of
a
type
equivalent
to
an
exclusive
dealing
agreement
which
prohibits
the
dealers
from
buying
shoes
of
other
people.
now,
the
commission
as
i
see
it
has
shifted
its
ground
on
this
many
times.
this
case
was
started
as
strictly
a
section
3
case.
it
was
tried
on
that
case.
the
hearing
examiner
decided
it
on
that
case,
on
that
theory,
but
then
when
he
undertook
to
determine
the
substantiality
of
the
effect,
he
said,
“if
you
measure
this
against
the
national
market
it
won't
be
substantial.
therefore,
i
will
measure
it
against
the
market
represented
only
by
these
stores,
the
area
in
which
they
do
their
retail
--
have
their
retail
businesses.”
now,
the
commission
came
along
and
found
it
was
substantial.
the
commission
came
along
and
said,
“no,
that's
for
long”
and
struck
out
those
findings
and
substituted
it's
own.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
section
3
was
not
used,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
it
was
not
mentioned
by
then.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
complained
under
section
5
charging
exclusive
dealing
and
substantial
effect.
at
conclusion
of
the
hearings
which
lasted
a
year
--
a
year
and
a
half,
the
trial
examiner,
the
hearing
examiner
considered
it
was
a
section
3
case
and
so
stated.
he
decided
as
i
say
on
the
theory
that
he
had
defined
substantial
effects
upon
competition
as
you
do
under
section
3,
but
the
commission
struck
out
those
findings
because
the
retail
limits
were
not
the
correct
limits
of
the
relevant
market
and
said,
“we
find
that
to
violate
section
5,
it's
akin
to
a
tie-in
arrangement.
then
having
found
that
akin
to
a
tie-in
arrangement,
the
commission
considered
our
contention.
no
you
have
to
measure
it
against
the
effect
upon
the
competition
and
said
that
that's
immaterial
and
reiterated
again.
we
find
it
violates
section
4
but
added
in
any
event
in
fact
and
i'm
not
quoting
the
exact
words
that
in
any
effect
we
find
that
the
competitor's
standards
had
been
met.
now
before
the
court
of
appeals,
the
argument
of
the
commission
was
this
is
akin
to
a
tie-in
arrangement
and
they
cited
northern
pacific
and
half
a
dozen
other
cases
and
the
court
of
appeals
analyzed
those
cases
distinguished
them
and
said,
“no,
it's
not
akin
to
tie-in
arrangement.”
now
in
the
brief
filed
here,
the
word
tie-in
only
appears
twice
and
as
i
understand
that
the
commission
has
abandoned
the
tie-in
theory
and
as
i
understood
the
counsel
to
say
their
position
is
that
the
standards
of
section
3
is
met
namely
the
substantial
effect
upon
competition
and
we
do
rely
upon
tamper,
tamper
was
a
20-year
prohibition,
20-year
exclusive
dealing
or
requirements
contract
affecting
a
little
less
than
1%
of
the
market.
here
is
an
agreement
that's
terminable
at
will.
the
market
is
not
foreclosed
to
these
other
dealers
and
they
actually
are
selling
in
this
market.
they're
selling
door
stores
not
as
much
as
they
would
like
to
sell
and
we
don't
sell
as
much
as
we
would
like
to
sell,
but
they're
actually
selling
in
it.
the
foreclosure
here
is
only
temporary.
when
anyone
buys,
if
i
would
buy
a
pair
of
shoes
not
much
of
the
market
is
foreclosed
and
preempted
until
they
wear
out
and
need
another
one.
whenever
a
dealer
buys
his
fall
stock
or
his
winter
stock
or
his
spring
stock
that
market
is
preempted
agreement
or
no
preempted
and
when
he
comes
to
replace
that
he
can
buy
those
shoes
from
anyone
he
sees
fit.
if
he
persists
in
buying
a
conflicting
line
and
dividing
his
forces
so
that
he
cannot
operate
an
efficient
and
prosperous
store,
we
do
terminating
rarely
but
occasionally
we
do
more
often
than
we
would
like
to
and
these
services
which
we
give
the
dealers
are
beneficial.
the
record
shows
that
these
dealers
hated
by
our
advice
of
our
servicemen,
of
our
field
men,
their
rate
of
return
is
16%
on
their
investment
on
the
average
compared
to
an
industry
rate
of
return
11.5%,
35%
more.
and
if
any
true
words
were
spoken
in
this
case
whereby
one
of
these
manufacturer
witnesses
that
the
commission
put
on
in
this
agreement
when
he
said
dealers
need
these
services.
now,
we
can't
in
the
first
place
afford
to
give
services
unless
there's
a
comparable
volume
to
sustain
this
expense
nor
can
we
give
services
that
are
worth
having
to
tell
a
dealer
how
to
merchandize
another
line
of
shoes.
for
us,
to
try
to
tell
the
dealer
how
to
merchandize
an
international
shoe
brand
of
shoe
or
some
other
brand
shoe,
we
don't
know
their
patterns.
we
are
not
familiar
with
how
they
perform.
we
don't
know
their
key
quoted
numbers.
the
only
way
we
can
tell
what
they
are
is
to
go
look
in
the
box
and
see
what
the
shoe
is
like.
our
servicemen
or
field
men
are
familiar
with
our
patterns.
they
know
how
they're
performing.
they
can
advice
these
dealers
on
purchases
and
upon
merchandising.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
these
field
men,
these
services
which
are
of
so
great
value.
they're
paid
on
a
salary
basis.
they
have
no
incentive
to
force
shoes
on
these
dealers.
their
success
is
measured
by
the
dealer's
success.
he
runs
a
prosperous
store
and
is
successful,
they're
successful.
the
salesmen
of
course
were
working
on
a
commission
and
have
an
interest
to
sell
all
the
shoes
they
can
while
these
field
men
of
course
want
them
to
concentrate
on
brown
lines.
they
don't
go
out
there
and
urge
them
to
concentrate
on
someone
else's
lines.
they
are
there
to
help
these
--
these
retail
dealers
to
help
them
survive
and
help
them
prosper
and
the
services
of
company
just
that
very
purpose.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
mr.
justice,
the
record
shows
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
most
of
these
benefits
and
services
which
have
been
mentioned
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
oh,
architectural
services
and
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
architectural
sir.
help
them
to
design
a
store,
remodel
a
new
store,
to
design
a
new
front,
display
services
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
help
them
--
help
them
to
display.
they're
listed
specifically
here
on
page
12
and
13
of
the
record.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
as
long
as
they
keep
them
waiting
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
that
is
--
that
is
correct
your
honor,
if
you
please,
unless
there
are
anti
competitive
effects
of
that
act.
now,
the
commission
found
that
it's
always
akin
to
a
tie-in
clause
an
inherently
after
that.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
unless
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
unless
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
well,
i
think
it
is
agreed
that
an
exclusive
dealing
agreement
or
a
requirements
agreement
is
not
illegal
per
se.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
well,
if
it
has
the
requisite
effects
to
substantially
lessen
competition.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
not
per
se.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
not
illegal
per
se.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
no,
i
don't
think
i
am
saying
that.
i
say
it
is
not
illegal
unless
it
is
--
it
has
it
and
anti
competitive
effects.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
substantial
effects
upon
competition
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
and
it
was
the
commission
who
sought
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
finding
that
said,
they're
akin
to
a
tie-in
clause
where
you
don't
have
to
find
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
think
the
consanguinity
is
so
remote
that
it
is
not.
now,
this
court
of
course
in
atlantic
refining
held
that
that
was
akin
to
or
have
the
effect
of
a
tie-in
clause,
although,
it
was
not
strictly
speaking,
a
tie-in
clause
arrangement,
but
there
you
had
a
situation
where
there
was
coercion,
where
there
was
appraisal,
where
there
was
the
use
of
economic
power
in
one
market
to
coerce
the
dealers
in
another
market.
these
services
which
we
rendered
we
have
no
leverage
over,
no
power
over,
they're
not
unique,
they're
offered
by
many
other
dealers,
and
the
commission
has
stipulated
not
just
that
these
large
companies
in
general
and
international
and
the
like
have
these
plans
but
that
virtually
all,
virtually
all
of
the
manufacturers
in
competition
with
us
offer
some
or
all
of
the
following
services
and
among
those
you
will
find
this
service
of
advice
to
business
advice
including
the
advise
on
proper
methods
of
merchandising.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
yes,
very
valuable
advice
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
and
i
think
then
we
would
have
the
effect
of
the
quantity
discount
and
if
it
could
be
justified
that
it's
perfectly
legal
to
give
as
long
as
it
is
not
offered
discriminatory
and
there's
no
evidence
of
that
here.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
don't
think
that
one
your
honor,
(2)
(d)
never
came
into
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
two,
there
is
no
evidence
that
these
services
were
ever
denied
to
a
single
dealer.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
think
that
(2)
(d)
has
to
make
--
the
service
have
to
make
whatever
you're
offering
available
to
the
--
you
don't
have
to
get
them
to
accept.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
now,
we're
trying
to
get
these
people
to
go
on
the
plan.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
everybody
who
could
qualify
on
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
they
are
required
under
these
programs
as
you
see
it
or
operate
--
to
have
adequate
capital
to
operate
a
modern
and
up
to
date
store
to
follow
the
accounting
plans
and
make
the
reports.
it's
not
just
a
one-way
street.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
and
we're
trying
to
get
them
to
go
on
the
plan.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
no
evidence
to
that
but
i'm
sure
that
if
that
had
been
asked,
the
answer
would
have
been
no.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
my
understanding
is
that
it
has
to
be
offered
to
everyone
on
the
same
classification
or
everyone
on
the
same
rule.
we
don't
have
to
classify
all
of
your
customers
the
same
way.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
so
there
is
some
practicality
there,
you
can't
do
it
in
a
discriminatory
way.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
it
is
not
available
to
anyone
who
--
basically
this
is
offered
to
the
family
shoe
stores,
to
the
people
who
carry
the
three
lines
of
shoes,
men's,
women
and
children.
now
there
are
exceptions.
there
are
few
instances,
very
few
instances
where
for
some
reason
or
another
a
store
may
carry
just
for
example
women's
and
children
shoes
but
their
volume
is
sufficient
to
justify
and
it's
offered
to
them,
but
it's
not
offered
to
the
store
who
carries
just
a
few
pair
of
shoes,
a
few
--
odd
lots
of
brown
shoes
or
even
a
single
line
of
brown
shoes
generally
speaking.
it
is
only
offered
to
those
who
concentrate
on
all
three
lines
of
brown
shoes.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
it
is
--
the
figure
of
1%
is
simply
an
entire
shoe
outlets
and
we're
simply
measuring,
these
are
not
open
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
the
program
is
not
--
the
program
is
not
open.
i
think
the
1%
is
used,
your
honor,
in
connection
with
the
volume
of
the
shoe
business
that
is
affected
by
this
anti
competitive
effects.
it
is
the
total
numbers
of
shoe
store.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
incidentally
as
to
the
total
mark.
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
as
the
total
volume
of
shoe
sales
in
dollars
at
retail
or
at
wholesale.
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
but
you're
simply
using
the
number
stores
as
a
possible
yardstick
to
measure
that.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
well,
i
don't
know
that
i
would
characterize
it
just
that
way,
but
we
do
only
offer
it
and
i
think
you
find
that
statement
made
in
our
brochure
that
it's
offered
only
to
the
aggressive
modern
up-to-date
progressive
dealer
who
wants
to
move
ahead
and
something
to
that
effect
in
finding.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
in
lieu
of
the
--
that
i
don't
believe
i
hope
to
answer
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
well,
the
commission
is
suggesting,
but
why
don't
you
just
charge
the
people.
why
don't
you
say,
‘we'll
get
the
advisory
services
for
a
fee?”
but
as
i
attempted
to
point
out,
our
services
would
be
of
no
value
in
trying
to
advise
on
other
people's
shoes
that
little
had
no
value,
we
could
keep
some
records
perhaps
but
it's
not
practical
to
do
that.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
and
the
dealers
would
not
pay
a
dime
for
those
services.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
we
like
to
--
we
like
to,
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
fortas
who
asked
whether
or
not
these
dealers
were
able
to
sell
their
shoes
at
a
cheaper
price
because
of
this
and
there's
nothing
of
that
sort
of
the
record.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
what
they're
doing
before
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
i
don't
know
that
those
services
were
available
or
paid
anytime
of
any
place.
they
do
get
these
services.
we
think
the
services
are
valuable
and
--
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
no
question
about
it
your
honor.
no
question
about
it.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
no.
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not
connected.
this
particular
program
or
predecessor
of
this
program
goes
back
to
1921.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
no.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
no,
that's
a
different
(voice
overlap)
this
is
a
different
brown.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
it's
a
different
brown.
mr.
robert
h.
mcroberts
no.
they're
still
in
business?
they
are
not.
your
honor,
thank
you.
