justice
abe
fortas
well,
a
real
difference
maybe
i
suggest
to
you
whether
you
have
a
--
whether
the
federal
trade
commission
is
going
to
acknowledge
or
admit
that
brown
shoe
company
can
buy
agreement
or
commission
or
otherwise
imposed
upon
a
retailer
the
decision
as
to
who's
shoes
he
is
going
to
carry
and
as
i
read
this
federal
trade
commission
says
the
brown
shoe
company,
you
cannot
directly
or
indirectly
impose
upon
--
you
cannot
directly
or
indirectly
deprive
a
retailer
of
the
right
to
exercise
as
independent
judgment
as
to
what
shoes
he's
going
to
carry
and
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
thinks
that's
only
the
thing
with
their
judgments.
the
trade
commission
thinks
that
that's
interfering
with
their
independent
judgment.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
you're
doing
whether
or
not
it's
a
violation
of
(2)
(d)
or
(2)
(e)
of
the
robinson
patman
act,
it
is
in
there
for
a
valuable
consideration
namely
the
offer
of
these
services.
and
you
are
obtaining
from
the
dealer,
this
is
a
trade
commission's
argue
--
conclusion
as
i
see
it.
you
are
obtaining
from
the
dealer
whether
it's
by
explicit
agreement
or
understanding
or
whatnot
and
undertaking
that
this
dealer
will
adhere
to
brown
shoes
views
as
to
from
whom
he
ought
to
buy
some
or
all
of
these
stock.
and
the
trade
commission
says,
no
matter
how
you
cut
that,
how
you
define
it,
how
thin
you
slice
it,
you
cannot
do
that
and
that's
the
issue
in
this
case,
is
it
not?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
telling
us
that
the
complainant
one
time
decided
the
violation
of
section
3?
justice
abe
fortas
section
3
was
never
recited
on
this
complaint
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
you're
saying
the
complain
under
section
5
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
about
(2)
(d)?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
suppose
it
comes
in
now?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
word
--
the
word
“deal”
is
that
we
would
not
--
brown
shoe
sold
the
shoes
to
dealers
who
are
not
in
the
franchise
plan,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
those
--
some
of
those
dealers
were
in
competition
with
dealers
who
where
in
the
franchise
plan.
now,
can
you
suggest
to
me
any
possible
rationalization
which
would
pick
this
up
on
the
(2)
(d)
violation?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
justice
abe
fortas
the
facts
here
indicate
that
these
services
were
available
only
to
persons
who
would
enter
into
an
agreement
or
understanding
that
they
would
not
buy
from
other
manufacturers'
lines
that
conflicted
with
the
lands
of
brown
shoe
company,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
say
that
so
long
as
they
offer
that
to
anybody,
to
everybody
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
now
how
do
you
qualify?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
much
--
justice
abe
fortas
somebody
said
the
brown
shoe,
“i
want
to
buy
this
air
steep
line
from
them
but
i
don't
want
your
services.
those
services
cost
you
money
but
i
would
like
to
have
an
equivalent
monetary
concession”,
is
there
anything
like
that
involved?
justice
abe
fortas
it
would
have
been
no.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
as
i
understand
the
law
if
they
--
to
--
if
an
allowance
of
service
is
offered
to
some
customers
and
there
are
other
customers
who
are
not
equipped
for
one
reason
or
another
to
receive
that
same
service
and
the
equivalence
has
to
be
offered
to
them,
its
your
understanding?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
you
have
to
classify
them
so
that
there
is
a
practicality
--
