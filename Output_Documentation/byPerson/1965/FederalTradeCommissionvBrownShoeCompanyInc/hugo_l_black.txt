justice

well,
this
seems
to
be
a
rather
specific
statement
to
do
that
which
you
say
you
wouldn't
object
to
this.
that
was
all
it
did
entering
into
continuing
and
operating
all
the
facts
on
imposing
in
the
agreement
that
understanding
as
any
customer
or
prospect
[inaudible]
imposing
any
conditions
which
as
the
purpose
or
effect
of
precluding
these
customer,
a
prospective
customer
from
independent
determination
whether
shoes
would
be
purchased
by
first
customer,
prospective
customers
of
any
concern
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that's
what
you're
objecting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
not
understood
exactly
the
services
that
you're
talking
about,
what
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
are
they?
that's
what
i'm
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
architectural
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
help
them
display.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
you
argue
it
i
gathered
it
was
at
the
moment
ago,
i'm
--
i
haven't
talk
to
you
before,
but
is
this
your
argument?
that
since
you
give
these
services,
there
are
things
of
value
and
you
agree
with
it
that
if
they
would
keep
your
--
your
line
only
that
you've
given
these
services
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
--
not
--
that
does
not
value
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
unless
they
add
a
competitive
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
that
--
why
wouldn't
it
be
an
added
competitive
effect
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
it
was
an
agreement
within
that
they
wouldn't
buy
--
handle
anybody
else's
shoes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wasn't
talking
about
illegal
per
se
here
(voice
overlap)
i
was
talking
about
anti
competitive?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
different
thing
as
to
how
much
--
how
much
you
lessen
but
as
i
understand
if
you're
saying
--
if
it's
not
anti
competitive
to
make
an
agreement
to
the
different
stores
and
places,
no
by
the
deal
handle
--
nobody
is
good
but
yours.
justice
hugo
l.

what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
illegal,
i
understand
that
but
are
you
saying
it's

effects.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand.
justice
hugo

when
they
seem
few
related

justice
hugo
l.
black
or
that
instead
of
giving
you
advise
of
the
counsel
which
is
worth
the
money.
i
assumed
it
was
that
particularly
--
justice
hugo

they
had
simply
said,
we'll
give
you
so
much
money
if
you
would
simply
agree
to
carry
our
goods.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
i
feel
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
but
i'm
just
asking
out
of
curiosity.
