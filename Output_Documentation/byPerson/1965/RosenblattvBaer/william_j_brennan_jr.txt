justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say,
there's
a
different
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
or
is
this
a
contract
under
which
he
was
employed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
from
what
funds
were
his
salary
is
paid?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
not
without
relation
to
the
proceeds
of
the
operation
of
the
recreational
area?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
are
we
to
read
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court's
opinion
on
this
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
are
we
to
read
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
opinion
on
this
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
we
to
treat
this
that
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
thought
he
was
a
public
official?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
if
he
were
a
public
official?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
that
so
then
surely
the
member
of
the
ski
patrol
has
a
function
in
an
official
capacity,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
the
way
a
dog
catcher
performs
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
services
a
dog
catcher,
or
a
garbage
collector
--
services
of
a
garbage
collector.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
only
to
say
that
his
official
capacity
is
one
which
involves
rather
heavier
responsibilities,
and
perhaps
the
member
of
the
ski
patrol
or
the
other?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
here
again,
i
would
suppose
the
public
would
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
how
a
dog
catcher
performs
his
official
duty
as
a
dog
catcher.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
newspaper
a
defendant
in
this
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
the
newspaper
a
defendant
in
this
action?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
a
policeman?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
your
dog
catcher?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
oppose
to
take
a
note
to
everything?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
brown,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
i
asked
mr.
nighswander?
the
--
the
supreme
court
considered
this
case
in
the
light
of
new
york
times
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
sullivan.
how
are
we
to
read
their
treatment
of
the
public
officials?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
a
little
puzzled
about
the
opinion
of
your
supreme
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
may
be
rather
i
thought
one
of
two
ways.
either
that
he
was
not
a
public
official
and
therefore
the
judgment
would
be
sustained.
or
that
if
he
was
as
mr.
nighswander
has
suggested
that
the
principles
laid
down
in
times
had
been
satisfied
at
the
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn't
what
to
what?
