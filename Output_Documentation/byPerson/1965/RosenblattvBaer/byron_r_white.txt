as
far
as
i
can
see
there's
nothing
in

apply
that
would
exclude
the
ski

justice
byron
r.
white
how

do
you
identify
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
hard,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
you
say,
you
don't
add
anything
by
talking
sovereignty.
if
the
job
is
created
by
statute
and
the
duties
are
described
then
you
say
there's
sovereignty
given
and
is
by

a

white
that
may
be
so
a
permanent
payroll
but
how
about
in
the
winter?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
hired
those
people
and
he
fired
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
make
the
decision
as
to
when
the

in
the
winter
for
example
to
close
down
the

or
open
it
up
or
not?
justice

r.
white
if
there
were
some
slight
danger,
was
it
his
decision
to
close
it
down
and
he
didn't
have
to
go
to
the
county
