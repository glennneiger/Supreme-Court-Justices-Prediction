mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
granting
our
petition
for
certiorari,
the
order
of
this
court
stated
that
counsel
had
directed
in
addition
to
argue
the
question
whether
at
the
time
of
respondent's
employment
as
supervisor
of
a
public
recreation
area,
he
was
a
public
official
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan
and
garrison
against
louisiana.
by
placing
a
case
on
the
court
list
for
summary
argument,
we
assume
that
the
court
is
interested
primarily
in
the
very
important
question
which
is
left
unanswered
by
new
york
times
and
garrison
as
to
where
the
line
shall
be
drawn
with
respect
to
the
protection
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
question
is
whether
this
court
having
enunciated
new
york
times
a
constitutional
rule
which
appears
to
us
to
be
clear
and
sound
should
now
limit
the
rule
to
public
officials
in
the
very
narrow
sense
as
argued
by
the
respondent
here
or
include
within
it
public
employees
who
may
technically
fail
to
meet
a
very
narrow
test,
but
who
nevertheless
by
reason
of
the
positions
they
hold,
such
as
the
respondent
here,
have
responsibility
and
authority
for
action
or
decision
in
an
area
in
which
the
public
has
a
legitimate
interest
and
concern.
in
new
york
times,
the
plaintiff
or
the
commissioner
for
the
city
of
montgomery,
alabama
in
charge
of
police,
the
court
said
“we
have
no
occasion
here
to
determine
how
far
down
the
lower
ranks
into
the
lower
ranks
of
government
employees
the
public
official
designation
would
extend
for
purposes
of
this
rule,
or
otherwise
to
specify
categories
of
persons
who
would
or
would
not
be
included.”
now,
if
we
did
not
believe
that
the
respondent
here
falls
within
the
scope
of
new
york
times
as
a
public
official
and
if
we
did
not
believe
that
the
alleged
defamatory
question
had
to
do
with
his
official
conduct,
if
in
fact
they
referred
to
him
at
all,
we
should
not
now
be
before
you.
although
an
excellent
argument
could
be
made,
and
i
refer
you
to
the
brief
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
filed
here
as
an
amicus,
for
a
rule
which
commits
comment
on
all
matters
of
public
concern
and
about
all
public
servants
or
employees
or
even
public
men,
when
such
statements
are
not
accompanied
by
malice
in
the
constitutional
sense,
we
prefer
to
argue
this
case
on
its
own
facts.
the
respondent
was
not
only
a
public
man
or
a
public
employee.he
was
in
fact
public
official.
now,
in
the
garrison
case
decided
in
november
23rd,
1964,
after
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
decision
in
this
case,
the
plaintiffs,
you
will
recall,
were
judges.
what
was
said
about
them
was
in
their
official
capacity.
no
mention
is
made
in
this
decision
as
to
whether
they
were
elected
or
appointed
which
appears
to
the
court
apparently
to
be
of
no
importance.
now,
the
next
cases
were
the
companion
cases
of
henry
v.
collins
and
henry
v.
pearson
decided
in
this
year.
now
here,
one
plaintiff
was
the
chief
of
police
and
the
other
was
a
county
attorney.
and
again,
the
court
appears
to
have
had
no
great
difficulty
in
bringing
them
within
the
scope
of
public
official
rule.
it
is
evident
that
there's
already
been
some
broadening
of
the
rule
since
new
york
times.
now
comparing
the
case
at
bar,
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
respondent,
as
in
new
york
times,
was
not
mentioned
by
name
or
reference
made
specifically
to
the
manager
of
the
appellant
area
such.
the
fact
that
comparison
was
made
only
with
respect
to
the
area
commission
and
manager
together
as
compared
with
prior
management,
the
specific
words
used
in
the
article
were
“what
magic
has
dana
beane?”
that
is
a
new
commissioner
and
rest
of
commission
and
mr.
warner
who
was
the
new
manager
under
the
new
authority
set
up
by
state
legislature
“wrought
to
make
such
many
difference
in
that
cash
results?”
logically
then,
we
say
that
the
comparison
sought
to
be
made
was
with
the
county
commissioners
who
were
elected,
and
baer
the
manager
on
the
one
hand
with
the
management.
now,
no
effort
was
made
in
the
article
to
pinpoint
any
responsibility
or
to
accuse
any
one.
now,
consider
the
facts
than
in
the
light
of
new
york
times
and
henry
case.
baer's
a
party
over
the
operation
on
the
taxpayer
on
and
tax
for
the
recreation
area
delegated
him
by
statute
by
the
county
commissions
with
approval
of
the
county
delegation
and
evidence
by
a
written
contract
included
--
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
yes,
your
honor
there
was
--
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
he
was
employed
for
approximately
nine
years.
and
originally
there
was
a
--
a
contract
that
was
set
up,
and
then
in
1953,
the
legislature
passed
the
law
which
set
up
the
office
of
manager
of
the
belknap
area.
and
another
contract
was
made
at
that
time
which
i
believe
was
for
two-year
period
and
thereafter
from
month
to
month.
so
they
continued
to
operate
under
that
contract,
possibly,
it
was
from
week
to
week.
but
in
any
rate
we
had
a
two-year
contract
which
was
allowed
to
carry
over.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
it's
--
i
think
that
there
were
two
contracts
and
i
think
you'll
find
there
both
exhibits
in
the
case.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
yes
we
have,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
and
the
exhibits
are
here
before
you.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
no
your
honor,
the
respondent
was
not
employed
at
the
time
the
libel
was
--
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
well,
i've
said
that
the
contract
at
that
time
which
was
the
second
one
he
had
had,
had
a
provision
that
it
was
to
continue
after
the
two-year
period
from
week
to
week.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
yes
it
was.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
now,
under
the
written
contract,
he
had
supervision
and
control
over
collection
of
fees
and
charges,
disbursement
of
fund
--
some
funds
and
approval
or
disapproval
of
the
disbursement
of
others,
the
keeping
of
records,
the
hiring
and
firing
of
employees
who
were
paid
by
public
funds,
depositing
of
cash,
supervision
of
all
operations
including
ski
lifts,
ski
school,
cafeteria,
gift
shop,
ski
shop,
rental
of
equipment,
maintenance
of
public
property,
purchases,
construction
and
all
other
activities
carried
on
at
the
area.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
they
were
paid
from
public
funds.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
no.
he
was
on
a
straight
annual
salary
basis.
he
testified
that
he
was
responsible
for
building
the
area
up
to
a
value
of
$1
million
or
more
and
handled
public
funds
in
excess
of
$200,000
per
year.
we
say
it
precisely
because
he
seeks
to
take
full
responsibility
for
the
operation
of
belknap
area
that
he
must
also
accept
the
consequences
under
the
rule
of
new
york
times.
he
was
known
as
mr.
belknap
area.
he
was
the
man
on
a
red
hat
for
whom
a
ski
trail
was
named.
he
testified
that
he
15,000
bosses.
these
were
the
taxpayers
of
belknap
county
to
whom
he
was
responsible.
he
was
directly
responsible
to
the
county
delegation
where
elected
representatives
either
23
or
24
in
number.
and
he
was
also
responsible
to
the
three
county
commissioners.
he
testified
that
he
was
a
trustee
of
public
funds,
that
he
was
responsible
for
all
cash
receipts,
and
that
the
operation
of
the
area
was
a
matter
of
public
concern
and
public
interest.
now,
he
even
took
an
active
part
in
public
debate
which
have
been
going
on
ever
since
1938
when
this
area
was
originally
built
with
wpa
funds
as
a
--
with
three
ski
jumps.
was
later
expanded
into
a
ski
area
and
a
public
recreation
area
and
there
always
been
some
dispute
in
a
community
as
to
whether
or
not
this
should
be
run
by
three
public
--
public
county
commissioners
who
are
politically-oriented
or
to
be
taken
away
from
them
and
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
special
authority
who
understood
skiing.
now,
this
public
debate,
which
was
going
on
around
1958
and
‘59
culminated
in
the
law
which
in
effect
did
take
belknap
area
out
of
the
hands
of
the
elected
county
commissioners
and
placed
it
in
the
hands
of
five
specially
oriented
people
who
acted
as
a
commission.
and
these
people
were
picked
because
they
understood
skiing,
because
they
understood
recreation,
were
lawyers,
accountants
and
so
on.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
pardon
me?
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
they're
picked
by
the
county
delegation.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
that's
the
elected
representatives
to
the
state
legislature
who
run
the
county
affairs
within
the
area
where
they're
elected.
and
they're
the
ones
that
now
pick
the
authority
to
run
the
belknap
area.
now,
mr.
baer
in
this
case
opposed
to
stand
of
the
county
commissioners
who
hired
counsel
to
try
to
prevent
the
passage
of
the
act
through
the
legislature,
but
this
was
unsuccessful.
it
was
taken
away.
it
was
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
new
authority
and
it
was
about
this
time
that
the
article
was
written
and
at
that
same
time,
a
bill
was
then
pending
in
the
legislature
again
to
take
it
out
of
the
hands
of
the
authority
and
to
put
it
back
in
the
hands
of
politically-oriented
county
commissioner.
so
this
is
the
backdrop
of
the
situation
at
that
time,
and
mr.
baer
was
--
pardon?
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
that's
correct.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
at
the
time,
pardon
me,
at
the
time
that
the
--
of
which
the
libel
related?
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
the
respondent
here
was
the
manager
of
the
belknap
area
who
was
hired
by
the
county
commissioners,
the
political
group,
under
written
contract
which
by
statute
had
to
be
approved
by
the
county
delegation.
and
he
was
let
go
a
few
months
before
the
new
commission
came
in,
the
public
announcement
which
appears
in
the
record
was
that
they
wanted
to
leave
the
new
commissioners
clear
so
that
they
could
pick
anyone
they
chose.
but
the
fight
was
still
going
on
as
to
whether
or
not
there
might
be
an
act
in
legislature
which
would
place
the
belknap
area
back
in
the
hands
of
these
county
commissioners
again.
now,
as
i
say,
mr.
baer
was
engaged
in
this
public
debate.
now
he,
in
--
he
appears
rather
to
be
insensitive
of
the
suggestion
that
anyone
else
could've
been
responsible
or
referred
to
in
this
article,
and
yet
he
now
seeks
to
avoid
the
same
responsibility
by
arguing
that
he
is
not
in
the
same
category
as
county
commissioners,
a
police
commissioner,
a
police
chief
or
county
attorney,
because
he
was
only
a
public
employee
not
a
public
official.
now,
it
is
only
because
he
has
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
a
public
official
that
the
words
may
be
said
by
innuendo
to
apply
to
him
at
all.
now,
we
say
the
stronger
he
makes
out
his
case
in
this
regard
then
the
more
surely
the
new
york
times
must
be
held
to
apply
to
him.
now,
should
the
respondent
here
be
able
--
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
well,
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
opinion
sir,
it
seems
to
us
misinterprets
completely
the
doctrine
as
laid
down
in
the
sullivan
case.
they
approved
in
their
opinion,
as
i
will
point
out
later,
a
charge
to
the
jury
which
is
directly
contrary
to
sullivan
which
was
similar
to
the
charge
that
was
given
in
garrison
and
which
was
disapproved
by
this
court,
and
i
will
explain
that
later.
and
the
supreme
court
in
new
hampshire
seemed
to
think
that
it
was
a
much
more
liberal
jurisdiction
as
far
as
the
rule
is
about
libel
were
concerned
prior
to
the
sullivan
case
and
that
therefore
there
wasn't
the
difficulty
that
there
was
with
the
alabama
law.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
the
supreme
court
in
new
hampshire
didn't
particularly
discuss
whether
he
was
a
public
official
or
not
because
in
their
opinion,
it
seems
to
me,
they
don't
differentiate
between
the
public
official
one
who's
not
because
they
indicate
that
their
rule
anyway
is
as
liberal
as
the
new
york
times
case
and
they
said,
“we
see
no
conflict
between
the
two.”
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
even
if
he
were,
and
we
think
the
case
is
clearly
wrong
on
that
as
you
will
see
if
you
examine
the
charge
of
the
jury,
and
i'll
give
you
part
of
it
if
i
have
time,
and
then
note
that
the
court
said
that
we
think
this
is
the
law
and
we
certainly
don't
think
that's
what
the
supreme
court
intended
to
say
here.
one
question
that
we
think
is
pertinent
here
is
whether
the
respondent
should
be
able
to
enlarge
the
meaning
of
the
words
used
in
the
question
by
innuendo
to
include
himself
within
the
group,
and
thus
to
enforce
liability
while
others
in
the
same
group
cannot.
now,
this
would
be
analogous
to
holding
that
while
the
police
commissioner
of
montgomery
was
not
specifically
mentioned,
could
not
recover
without
proof
of
malice.
the
police
chief
has
subordinate,
could
claim
that
he
too
was
included
in
the
state
by
innuendo,
therefore,
could
bring
a
suit
even
though
his
superior
could
not.
now,
certainly
if
the
police
chief
of
clarksdale
could
not
recover,
police
chief
of
montgomery
should
not
be
able
to
recover
and
neither
should
the
respondent
in
this
case.
now
what
kind
of
a
rule
would
it
be
that
respondent
here
seeks
to
have
this
court
adopt
that
would
distinguish
between
a
public
official
and
a
public
servant
on
the
basis
solely
as
to
whether
or
not
he
has
been
delegated
by
law
or
statute
sovereign
power
and
can
exercise
it
independently
as
stated
in
the
respondent's
brief,
page
29.
now,
as
we
read
this,
according
to
this,
a
notary
public
would
meet
these
requirements
under
the
law
of
new
hampshire,
he'd
be
a
public
official
but
a
person
with
great
authority,
one
who
has
a
subordinate
position
like
an
assistant
secretary
of
state
might
be
considered
only
a
public
servant.
now,
many
other
illustrations
might
occur
to
on
this
point.
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
baer's
position
as
manager
was
created
by
statute,
1953,
his
duties
as
set
forth
in
the
written
contract
where
the
commission
is
where
the
approval
of
the
county
delegation
and
the
scope
of
his
responsibility
was
even
enlarged
by
a
letter
accompanying
the
contract
from
the
commissioners.
he
held
the
post
for
nine
years
as
an
annual
salary
and
part
of
the
time
his
contracts
were
of
the
terms
of
one
year
or
two
years.
a
42
am.
jur.
public
officer
has
about
250
pages,
i
think,
on
public
office
--
public
offices
and
it
says
in
part,
and
i
quote
only
from
the
introductory
paragraphs,
“public
office
and
public
officer
are
terms
of
vague
and
variant
import.
the
meaning
of
which
varies
with
the
connection
in
which
they
used.ordinarily
and
generally,
a
public
officer
is
defined
to
be
the
right
or
party
and
duty
created
and
conferred
by
law,
the
tenure
of
which
is
not
transient,
occasional
or
incidental
but
which
for
a
given
period
an
individual
is
invested
with
power
to
perform
a
public
function
for
the
benefit
of
the
public.”
now,
this
reference
to
am.
jur.
will
disclose
many
cases
where
under
various
facts
and
for
different
purposes
courts
have
construed
the
words
public
official
or
public
officer.
now,
one
can
find
authority
for
almost
any
position,
but
it
is
said
the
duration
or
tenure
need
not
be
fixed
so
long
as
not
occasional
and
even
with
respect
to
sovereign
power
the
fact
that
duties
are
confined
in
narrow
limits
is
not
considered
material.
a
subordinate
or
inferior
officer
is
nonetheless
an
officer.
now,
few
of
the
positions
held
to
be
public
office
which
might
be
analogous
are
cited
in
this
treaties,
and
some
of
them
are
officers
of
public
institutions,
superintendent
of
county
home,
superintendent
of
state
hospital,
district
maintenance
superintendent,
deputy
superintendent
police
and
many
others.
therefore,
we
say
that
mr.
baer's
position
seems
to
satisfy
even
the
very
narrow
rule
which
the
respondent
favors.
now,
certainly,
the
supreme
court
could
not,
we
believe,
have
such
a
narrow
definition
in
mind
in
new
york
times.
justice
learned
hand
in
the
case
of
gregoire
and
biddle,
just
cited
in
barr-matteo
and
garrison-louisiana,
commenting
upon
the
problem
of
how
far
the
privilege
of
immunity
of
public
officials
from
suit
for
statements
of
defamatory
nature
should
extend
states
in
part
as
follows.
the
complexities
in
magnitude
of
governmental
activity
had
become
so
great
a
must
of
necessity
be
a
delegation
and
re-delegation
of
authority
as
to
many
functions,
and
we
cannot
say
that
these
functions
become
less
important
simply
because
they're
exercised
by
officers
of
lower
rank
and
the
executive
in
higher
rank.
or
as
mr.
justice
black
said
in
barr-matteo,
the
effective
functioning
of
a
free
government
like
ours
depends
largely
on
the
force
of
an
informed
public
opinion.
this
calls
for
the
widest
possible
understanding
of
a
quality
of
government
service
rendered
by
all
official
elected
or
appointed
for
employees.
such
an
informed
understanding
depends
of
course
on
the
freedom
people
have
to
applaud
or
criticize
the
way
public
employees
do
their
jobs
from
the
least
to
the
most
important.
now,
we
do
not
necessarily
ask
the
court
here
to
adopt
a
broadened
rule.
however,
the
strength
in
our
position,
i
just
like
to
call
your
attention
to
some
developments
which
suggest
a
broadening
of
the
rule.
now,
as
early
as
1908,
the
case
of
coleman
and
maclennan
in
kansas,
which
is
quoted
in
new
york
times
and
garrison,
stated
in
such
a
case
the
occasion
gives
rise
to
the
privilege
qualified
to
the
extent
that
any
one
claiming
to
be
defamed
by
the
communication
must
show
malice
or
go
remediless.
the
privilege
extends
to
a
great
variety
of
subjects
and
includes
matters
of
public
concern,
public
men
and
candidates
for
office.
analogous
reasoning
is
found
in
the
early
affair
comment
cases
cited
in
footnote
20
of
justice
brennan's
decision.
it
should
be
noted
the
rule
in
restatement
of
tort,
section
607
in
1938
which
reversed
a
previous
graph
which
would
have
set
forth
the
new
york
times
rule
says,
“privilege
of
criticism
of
so
much
of
another's
activities
as
our
matters
of
public
concern
includes
a
privilege
to
criticize
the
public
conduct
of
all
officers
and
employees
of
the
united
states
from
this
corporation.”
professor
willard
pedrick
in
an
article
in
cornell
law
review
in
the
summer
of
1964
argues
forcefully
that
new
york
times
should
mean
that
hereafter
the
press
and
all
citizens
will
enjoy
a
good
faith
privilege
with
respect
to
discussions
of
matters
of
public

recent
cases
have
applied
the
rule
to
a
law

of

mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
it
would
not.
i
think
that
we're
not
pressing
it.
i'm
only
saying
that
there
is
this
body
of
opinion
that
--
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
correct.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
i
don't
think
it's
essential
to
our
case
to
even
enlarge
the
rule.
i
think
we
can
come
within
it,
but
i
just
want
to
mention
that
because
these
are
the
pressures
that
are
bearing
on
this
question
today
to
clarify
it
and
to
broaden
it.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
not
as
far
as
we
want
to
go,
your
honor,
because
the
ski
patrol
--
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
pardon?
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
well
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
saying
your
honor
is
that
as
far
as
our
case
is
concerned
this
can
be
decided
on
the
facts
and
leave
for
future
determination
the
question
of
how
far
down
the
various
echelon
of
government
should
go.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
are
cases
now
pending
where
the
courts
seemed
to
have
broadened
the
rule
already
adopted
by
the
united
states
supreme
court
to
include
public
men,
such
as
general
walker
from
--
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
well,
this
is
--
it's
rather
difficult
in
any
case
like
this
to
actually
come
right
down
to
a
decision,
as
justice
fortas
meant.
we
do
suggest
in
our
brief
here
possibly
how
you
can
do
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
to
a
certain
extent,
the
second
part
of
the
rule
is
important.
that
is,
was
it
within
his
official
capacity?
are
you
criticizing
something
that
somebody
did
within
his
official
capacity?
then
you
look
at
his
official
capacity.
now,
it
may
be
that
the
rule
could
be
limited
to
this
matter
of
visual
capacity
and
go
all
the
way
down.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
if
--
if
the
criticism
of
him
were
with
respect
to
his
duty
on
the
ski
patrol.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
that's
correct.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
that's
right.
of
course
in
those
cases,
you
get
narrower
and
narrower
functions
and
that's
where
the
field
of
official
capacity
becomes
less
and
less.
but
nevertheless,
a
rule
like
that
could
be
adopted
but
i
think
in
this
particular
case
it
is
not
necessary
because
we're
talking
about
the
man
who
is
actually
in
charge
of
the
belknap
area
who
is
representing
the
taxpayers
and
handling
their
money,
and
--
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
that's
correct.
now,
perhaps
i've
suggested
here
also
that
if
there
is
to
be
a
limited
definition
of
public
official,
then
perhaps
i
suggest
the
test
might
be
whether
he
has
responsibility
and
duties
with
the
respect
to
matters
in
which
the
public
has
legitimate
interest
and
concern.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
quite
possible
sir,
i
--
i
think
it's
quite
possible
that
even
this
definition
might
be
extended
quite
a
bit
beyond
the
facts
for
the
case.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
that
there
may
--
it
may
very
well
go
down
much
farther
except
that
i
don't
want
our
case
to
be
tied
with
this
because
i
don't
think
it's
necessary.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
that's
correct.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
that's
right.
now,
there
is
another
issue
that
i'd
like
to
discuss,
and
i
see
my
time
is
already
getting
short,
and
that
is
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
any
actual
malice,
because
we
recognized
there
is
a
qualification
to
this.
now
here,
we
are
guided
by
the
statement
of
the
rule
as
set
forth
in
new
york
times
where
justice
brennan
defines
the
actual
malice
as
follows.
unless
he
proves
that
the
statement
was
made
of
actual
malice
that
is
with
knowledge
that
it
was
false
or
with
reckless
disregard
of
whether
it
was
true
or
false,
we
submit
the
proof
of
malice
in
this
case
lacks
the
convincing
clarity
which
the
constitutional
standard
demands.
now,
if
the
court
will
examine
the
court's
charge
which
is
printed
in
full
in
our
brief
on
page
71,
which
the
supreme
court
in
new
hampshire
said
that
they
approved.
he
--
the
court
stated
malice
means
ill
will,
evil
motive,
intention
to
injure,
want
and
disregard
the
rights
of
others.
malice
does
not
necessarily
require
ill
will
or
evil
motive,
although
such
would
constitute
malice
but
malice
may
consist
of
the
intention
of
publication
of
defamatory
matter
with
the
reckless
disregard
of
the
rights
of
others.
and
it
may
consistently
willfully
doing
an
act
or
willful
neglect
of
an
obligation
which
the
right
to
know
is
liable
to
injure
another
regardless
of
consequences
even
though
there
is
no
actual
intention
there
to
hurt
or
harm
an
individual.
now,
we
say
this
directly
contrary
to
the
rule
in
both
garrison
and
the
henry
cases.
actually
the
courts
charged
defines
reasonable
grounds
for
belief
as
the
basis
on
which
the
privilege
is
given
and
said
it's
a
qualified
privilege.
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant
to
prove
good
faith,
to
prove
that
the
people
should
know
about
it,
about
what
he's
attempting
to
say
and
that
they
--
that
he
therefore
has
the
duty
to
say
it
and
the
hopes
they'll
take
some
action.
well,
any
way,
if
the
court
examines
the
charge,
i
think
you
will
find
there
are
many
places
that
indicate
there's
not
in
cons
with
the
rule.
furthermore,
the
statements
for
malice
were
given
only
at
the
end
of
the
charge
and
had
to
do
only
with
the
question
of
damages.
so
that
we
say
that
the
burden
was
unconstitutionally
placed
upon
the
defendant
in
the
case
to
prove
good
faith,
which
was
another
way
of
saying
prove
lack
of
malice.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
yes.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
it's
a
county
job.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
about
30,000.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
laconia
is
an
industrial
town
but
it
has
a
large
summer
population.
it's
a
recreational
center
and
that's
what
makes
this
very
important
to
the
economic
community
because
there
are
many
inns
and
hotels
there
as
well
as
other
recreational
--
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
well,
i
think
there
are
many
people
who
would
like
to
have
it.
i
think
the
salary,
i'm
not
exactly
sure
the
figure
was
around
$7,000
when
mr.
baer
had
it.
i
don't
know
what
it
is
by
the
present
time,
but
it's
a
fairly
popular
--
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
no,
this
is
a
fulltime
job
of
operating
the
belknap
recreation
area,
fulltime
employee.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
i'm
sorry.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
yes
it
is
and
--
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
yes
it
is.
it
has
both
summer
and
winter,
and
summer
time
they
hold
motorcycle
races
there
and
other
events
and
in
the
winter
there
are
ski
events
and
it
is
used
for
recreation
of
skiing,
there
are
thousands
of
people
there
on
weekends
and
so
on.
now,
we
also
--
i
see
my
time
is
elapsing
here,
but
i
think
that
the
title
of
the
article
itself
is
the
column
which
is
written
by
this
man,
which
is
an
unpaid
column
says
“out
of
my
head”.
what
he
was
trying
to
do
and
if
you
read
the
articles
which
are
here
which
have
to
do
with
the
belknap
area
out
of
some
600
he
wrote,
you
would
see
that
what
he
was
trying
to
do
was
bring
attention
to
various
public
issues.
sometimes
he
made
people
angry.
sometimes
he
stirred
up
discussion.
people
might
have
called
him
names
because
of
what
he
wrote,
but
what
he
was
trying
to
do
was
focus
attention
on
public
issues
within
belknap
county.
and
also
he
wanted
to
try
to
improve
the
belknap
area.
there
was
no
vendetta,
if
you'll
read
the
record,
you
see
there
was
no
vendetta
against
the
--
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
yes
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
well,
he
ran
a
store
and
being
a
--
well
sometime
ago,
he
had
some
training
in
journalism.
he
wanted
to
write
a
column.
and
so
he
took
the
opportunity
to
pass
these
columns
over
to
the
paper
under
the
title
“out
of
my
head”,
alfred
rosenblatt.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
pardon?
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
regularly.
some
600
were
written
altogether
on
various
public
matters
and
those
that
have
to
do
with
the
belknap
area
which
were
over
some
period
of
time
are
all
set
forth
here
in
detail.
and
in
those
articles,
he
called
upon
the
public
to
tell
them
about
certain
things
which
he
found,
which
would
be
improved
or
suggestions
which
he
had
to
make
such
as
giving
ski
lessons
to
children,
free
ski
lesson
or
low
rental
of
ski
equipment
or
suggestions
of
this
nature.
and
at
the
same
time,
he
also
brought
up
questions
that
might
be
critical
of
the
management
of
the
area
and
hopes
that
it
might
be
improved.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
after
his
contract
had
expired
and
was
continued
by
the
terms
of
it
from
week
to
week
it
was
terminable
on
notice
by
the
county
commissioners.
i
see
--
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
is
the
newspaper?
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
the
newspaper
was
originally
a
defendant
and
that
case
was
apparently
settled
out
of
court
before
our
case
came
to
trial.
and
i
see
my
time
--
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
no,
the
statute
did
not
proscribe
any
particular
term
but
only
proscribed
that
there
should
be
a
manager
who
would
be
hired
by
the
county
commissioners,
but
with
the
approval
of
the
county
delegation.
this
was
the
basis
of
the
statute,
but
didn't
say
anything
about
his
salary
or
the
tenure
of
his
office.
mr.
arthur
h.
nighswander
thank
you.
