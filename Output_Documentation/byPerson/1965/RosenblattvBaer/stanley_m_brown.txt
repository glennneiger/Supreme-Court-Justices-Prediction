mr.
stanley
m.
brown
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
i
propose
to
use
my
time
on
two
questions
only
of
those
that
have
been
briefed.
first
one
will
be
our
view
of
the
correct
answer
to
the
question
we
were
specifically
invited
to
argue.
that
is
whether
or
not
baer
was
or
was
not
a
public
official
at
the
time
of
this
libel
or
previously
when
he
hasn't
employed
by
the
council.
the
second
question
to
which
i
desire
to
invite
the
attention
of
the
court
is
the
question
whether
a
lawful
occasion
is
a
matter
which
properly
under
our
jurisprudence,
a
court
should
determine
to
exist
or
not
to
exist
or
whether
it
involves
in
the
usual
case
and
in
this
case,
questions
of
fact
which
necessarily
must
be
determined
by
the
jury
or
whatever
part
of
our
system
finds
fact.
now,
before
i
get
into
it,
i
want
to
if
i
may
just
for
a
moment,
get
into
what
the
facts
of
this
case
were
because
it's
quite
apparent
to
me
since
it's
only
one
copy
of
the
record
down
here
that
the
court
has
not
had
the
ability
as
yet
to
get
those
facts
in
line
and
they
are
these.
my
client
fritzy
baer
was
hired
in
1950
on
a
contract
which
was
terminable
at
any
time
on
two
weeks
notice
by
the
county
commissioners
who
hired
him.
at
page
6
of
our
brief,
the
salient
points
of
that
contract
are
set
forth
and
that
contract
is
specific
that
no
sovereign
powers
are
delegated
by
the
county
commissioners
to
baer.
it
is
specific
that
regardless
of
how
broad
the
language
is
giving
him
his
duties,
the
powers
are
withheld.
that
was
in
1950.
now,
at
that
time
the
county
had
statutory
authority
to
hire
a
supervisor
for
recreational
area.
so
that
the
contract
was
executed
in
accordance
with
the
statute,
but
the
statute
is
bare
of
any
delineation
of
duties
of
powers,
gives
no
tenure
at
all.
and
in
1953,
the
only
change
was
made
was
to
require
that
the
county
commissioners
secure
the
approval
of
the
county
delegation,
their
superiors
in
the
public
official
hierarchy
before
they
negotiated
a
contract
but
it
is
still
set
out
specifically
that
this
is
a
job
to
be
negotiated
on
an
employment
contract.
now,
the
second
contract
is
made
as
of
1955,
the
man
is
on
a
week
to
week
hiring
subject
to
two
weeks
notice
of
termination
either
way.
that
was
his
employment
from
then
until
july
of
1959
and
he
was
fired.
he
was
given
his
two
weeks
notice
and
let
go
in
the
notice
in
june,
he's
let
go
in
july,
this
is
six
months
before
the
libel.
there
was
no
legislative
rowel
going
on
at
the
time
of
this
libel
at
all,
the
legislature
only
meets
in
new
hampshire
every
other
year
and
this
is
a
none
legislative
year.
that's
the
situation.
now
factually
this
--
in
this
record
and
this
is
absolutely
clear
and
there's
no
argument
about
it.
there
was
one
individual
only
who
had
the
responsibility
for
and
actually
handled
cash
from
its
being
picked
up
at
the
till,
at
the
ski
lifts
and
the
ski
shop
and
the
restaurant
took
that
long
and
counted
it,
made
a
deposit
slip
and
put
it
in
the
bank
to
the
credit
of
the
county
and
that
man
was
fritzy
baer,
and
all
of
the
people
in
this
county
who
skied
who
were
up
there
knew
that
that
was
the
job
he
did.
one
thing
he
did
in
his
hand,
in
his
hand
went
every
dollar
of
$200,000
a
year.
and
he
was
accounting
part
by
putting
it
in
the
bank.
he
had
no
authority
to
draw
a
check.
he
had
no
authority
to
buy
5
cents
worth
of
anything.
all
of
the
controls
were
exercised
by
the
county
commissioners,
they
made
all
the
decisions,
except
for
one
thing,
that
the
handling
of
cash
was
fritzy
baer
all
the
way
from
the
turning
of
the
$200,000
to
the
bank.
now,
when
this
man
comes
out
and
says
falsely
that
the
income
at
that
area
is
literally,
and
he
meant
it,
literally
hundreds
of
percent
better
under
this
new
management
than
it
was
last
year
and
the
previous
years.
and
then
he
says
this
may
only
makes
bit
require
that
you
pondered.
what
happened
to
all
the
money
last
year?
what's
he
talking
about?
this
is
not
a
case
that
was
tried
on
presumption.
read
the
record,
this
went
through
that
community
like
wild
fire
and
the
meaning
was
clearly
understood
by
everybody
that
rosenblatt
was
raising
the
insinuation
that
baer
had
been
stealing.
he
had
been
dipping
in
the
tilt.
there's
no
other
explanation
for
the
language
used
under
these
circumstances
and
there's
a
prior
history
of
two
years
of
sniping
by
rosenblatt
of
baer
questioning
who
handles
the
money.
who
makes
the
deposit?
who
does
this?
why
won't
fritzy
baer
answer
these
questions?
this
was
in
public
print.
all
the
answers
were
given
to
him
privately.
he
acknowledged
privately
that
he
had
the
answers,
but
he
continued
to
ask
the
question
public,
why
won't
fritzy
baer
answer
these
questions?
well,
the
reason
fritzy
couldn't
answer
them
was
that
this
being
a
function
of
a
manager.
the
county
commissioners
told
him
don't,
instructed
him
not
to
answer.
he
had
no
authority
to
answer.
in
the
public
debate
about
the
money,
the
commissioners
exercised
their
prerogatives.
now
that's
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
because
when
this
man
raised
these
questions,
the
county
commissioners
immediately
sent
word
to
him
at
his
store
in
laconia,
he
owns
two,
that
if
he
wanted
those
facts,
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
go
down
to
the
end
of
the
street,
it's
perhaps
700
yards
and
all
of
the
answers
to
all
of
his
questions
were
a
matter
of
public
record
at
the
courthouse
and
he
was
welcome
to
come
in
and
they'd
all
be
made
available
to
him.
he
eventually
did,
take
him
up
on
it
and
he
did
acknowledge
at
a
budget
hearing
that
with
those
records,
after
he
took
the
title
and
got
them
all
of
his
questions
had
been
answered.
he
never
told
the
general
public
that
his
--
his
questions
had
been
answered
but
he
acknowledged
in
fact
they
were.
this
is
part
of
the
record
justice
black.
but
that's
the
factual
case
that
we
have
here.
we
did
not
win
this
case
on
any
presumptions.
we
want
it
by
a
hard
fought
trial
against
my
brother
nighswander
and
his
office
who
are
quite
competent
trial
attorneys.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
$31,500
and
there
is
specific
evidence
of
lost
job
opportunities
and
lost
earnings
totaling
$16,500
on
special
damages
alone.
that
is
detailed
in
the
supreme
court
decision
as
well
as
in
the
briefs.
now
getting
to
the
question,
i
say
this,
going
to
times
and
sullivan
public
official.
this
court
invited
our
argument
as
to
whether
this
man
is
a
public
official
or
not.
i
think
it
is
noteworthy
that
there
isn't
a
single
citation
of
authority
in
my
brother's
brief
or
in
the
amicus
brief
as
to
what
does
and
what
does
not
constitute
being
a
public
official.
now,
there
is
a
large
body
of
law
on
this
point.
and
it
is
generally
held
throughout
all
jurisdictions
including
this
one
that
there
are
two
at
least
essential
elements
to
being
a
public
officer
or
holding
a
public
office.
some
delegation
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
political
body
for
whom
you
act,
and
some
delineation
in
the
law
of
what
those
duties
are.
now,
if
this
court
is
going
to
stay
with
the
sullivan
rule,
it
seems
to
me
that
those
of
us
who
work
down
below
in
the
trial
pit
or
on
the
courts
of
the
rest
of
these
jurisdictions,
we
have
a
right
to
have
that
rule
made
a
legal
rule
rather
than
a
factual
rule
to
be
applied
as
we
come
here
with
every
case.
and
i
think
this
court
has
two
options.
you
can
say
in
each
individual
case
we're
going
to
review
what
the
actual
duties
or
demand
in
office
in
his
performance
of
whatever
he's
doing,
what
he's
actually
doing.
that's
factually,
and
that
means
that
some
judge
at
pre-trial
or
when
the
case
goes
to
the
jury
is
going
to
have
--
had
to
have
a
factual
determination
made.
the
other
way
to
do
it
is
the
way
we
suggest
in
our
brief.
if
a
public
office
is
one
where
there
must
be
a
delegation
of
some
type
of
sovereignty
to
be
exercised
by
the
man
independently.
if
he
looks
for
his
authority
to
the
statute,
which
is
what
the
general
law
is
in
this
field.
then
when
you
come
into
court,
whether
you
are
a
public
official
or
not
can
be
determined
as
a
matter
of
law
by
reference
to
the
law
where
the
law
should
be
in
the
books,
rather
than
by
a
parade
of
witnesses
as
to
whether
he's
digging
ditches
or
doing
something
else.
it
should
not
be
on
a
factual
basis
if
it
is
a
part
of
a
constitutional
rule
annunciated
by
this
court,
it
should
be
on
the
legal
basis.
and
the
legal
basis
is
present
throughout
all
of
the
statutory
schemes
of
all
the
states.
now,
in
my
state
of
new
hampshire,
there
is
a
specific
statute
that
no
person
shall
exercise
the
duties
of
any
public
office
without
having
been
taken
an
oath.
my
man
never
was
subjected
to
any
oath.
neither
shall
anybody
exercise
public
office
in
my
state
without
being
bonded.
he
wasn't
bonded.
the
county
officers
are
set
up
by
statute
and
in
every
single
solitary
case,
the
duties
of
the
officers
specified
by
the
statute
so
that
the
man
who
has
the
office
knows
what
his
power
and
duties
are.
this
man
was
appointing
for
the
county
commission
and
that's
all
he
was.
he
was
doing
the
day
to
day
operation
taking
the
money
to
the
bank
and
every
decision
that
was
made
was
made
by
the
county
commissioner,
including
the
one
to
fire
baer.
now,
under
those
circumstances
there
is
no
law
with
which
i
am
familiar
that
would
say
that
a
man
hired
on
an
employment
contract
given
no
sovereignty,
given
no
tenure,
having
no
public
powers
at
all
is
a
public
official.
now
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
a
policeman
in
my
state
is
a
public
officer
and
he's
sworn
and
he
is
armed
and
he
is
given
the
sovereignty
of
the
state.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
we
don't
presently
to
my
knowledge
have
them
as
such.
when
we
had
keepers
of
the
pound,
they
were
public
officials.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
yes.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
yes
and
--
and
as
a
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
had
to
account
for
the
proceeds
of
the
poundage
on
the
operation
of
the
pound.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
in
new
hampshire,
the
county
clerk
is
the
public
official,
the
secretaries
are
not.
county
clerk,
register
of
probate,
register
of
deed,
county
attorney,
county
commissioners,
superintendent
of
some
of
our
county
firms
are
and
some
are
not
by
a
special
set
of
statute.
but
if
they're
public
officers,
we
know
they're
public
officers
then
we
know
what
their
duties
are
because
they're
specified.
now,
in
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
i
say
that
the
law,
the
established
--
the
subtle
law
is
that
no
one
is
a
public
officer
unless
he
is
given
some
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
community
and
he
is
given
that.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
well
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
--
let
me
--
let
me
give
--
give
you
the
two
situations.
in
my
state,
the
county
is
authorized
to
hire
a
supervisor
of
recreational
areas.
now,
that
is
a
grant
of
authority
to
hire
somebody,
employ
them
on
employment
contract.
there's
nothing
more
said,
but
when
we
say
to
be
a
county
attorney
there
is
then
four
or
five
paragraphs
giving
specifically
what
his
duties
or
obligation
and
powers
are
and
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
no,
there
is
something
else
here.
the
government
must
be
operated
by
men,
and
whether
a
man
is
exercising
sovereignty
in
what
he's
doing,
as
you
are
as
a
member
of
this
court,
and
i
am
not
as
counsel
although
i'm
an
officer
of
this
court
redirect
this
petition.
it's
quite
interesting
on
this
type
--
on
this
particular
point.
when
you
are
working
as
the
arm
of
the
government
and
you
have
duties
which
you
exercise
on
your
independent
evaluation
of
what
your
duties
are
rather
than
taking
your
directives
from
someone
else
who
is
in
that
status
and
having
him
in
position
to
take
the
power
away
from
you,
give
you
more,
overrule
you,
there
is
a
difference.
and
it's
well
recognized
in
the
cases.
on
the
one
hand,
the
officer
status
can
be
demonstrated
legally,
the
other
can
not.
and
that's
the
guideline
i
--
i
suggest
if
you're
going
to
keep
on
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
the
police
officer
once
he
is
in
office
on
his
beak
is
his
own
man
and
he
has
a
sovereignty
of
the
state.
he
is
entitled
to
pull
that
gun
to
enforce
what
he
thinks
the
law
is.
the
private
citizen
is
not.
he
does
have
that
authority
and
is
quite
a
bit
of
decided
case
authority
on
this
particular
point.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
yes
sir.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
judge
black,
we
still
have
50
separate
states
and
we're
still
going
to
have
50
different
sets
of
laws
including
these.
now,
i
don't
think
this
court
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
of
course
judge
black,
you're
in
better
position
than
i'd
know
what
the
court
may
have
had
in
mind,
but
it
seems
to
me
sir
and
i
think
that
make
this
argument
once
again,
you
have
two
options.
perhaps
you
have
three
and
i
think
perhaps
you
might
espouse
the
third.
you
have
a
situation
of
taking
the
legal
concept.
after
all,
the
words
were
the
courts
word,
public
official,
and
public
official
to
lawyers
has
the
connotation
which
the
general
law
has
developed.
that's
what
--
that's
what
i
argue,
you
should
stay
with
the
language
you
adopted.
now,
if
you
don't
do
that,
you
can
go
all
the
way
and
say
that
every
person
in
public
employee,
that's
one
out
of
every
six
people
in
the
united
states
that
all
of
them
are
public
officials
including
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
well,
i
say
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
alright,
yes.
and
the
third
position
is
that
you
would
delineate
some
in
and
some
out
on
a
factual
analysis
of
what
their
duties
are
which
is
the
only
other
alternative
you
have,
unless
this
court
can
revise
the
statutes
of
all
of
the
50
states
which
is
impossible.
so
i
think
those
are
the
three
possibilities
and,
as
i
say,
i
think
the
trial
attorneys
and
judges
and
the
courts
of
the
states
are
entitled
to
have
this
demarcation
on
a
legal
basis
rather
on
the
fact.
that's
my
argument.
so
far
as
new
hampshire
is
concerned,
we
already
grant
this
privilege
on
the
entire
basis
rather
than
on
the
limited
basis.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
no,
i
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
there
isn't
any
question
about
that
at
all,
and
i
think
actually
the
cases
that
we've
cited
in
the
briefs
on
both
sides
indicated
much.
now,
the
other
point
i'd
like
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
certainly,
sir.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
the
record
here
is
bereft
of
any
evidence
on
that
point.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
the
record
is
bereft
with
any
evidence
on
that
point,
yes
sir.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
it
was
absolute
--
there's
no
litigation
on
it
at
all.
we
were
trying
the
case
before
sullivan.
now,
the
other
--
the
other
point,
if
i
may
for
a
moment
that
i'd
like
to
invite
to
the
attention
of
the
court
is
this.
in
sullivan
and
in
garrison,
and
i
think
inferentially
in
the
henry
cases,
this
court
seems
to
indicate
that
a
privilege,
the
existence
of
a
privilege
as
being
disposed
of
in
this
court
at
least,
are
on
a
legal
basis.
that
is
that
that
is
something
that
is
decided
legally.
i
have
reviewed
the
authorities
--
the
state
authorities
and
i
think
all
of
the
authorities
of
this
court
on
this
proposition
and
i
find
no
support
generally
for
the
proposition
that
it
is
a
legal
matter
whether
or
not
a
particular
writing
is
privileged.
now,
in
my
state,
we
have
responsible
authority
going
back
over
the
years
if
that
is
not
the
case.
privilege,
lawful
occasion
are
not
legal
matters
as
much
as
they
are
factual
in
the
ordinary
case.
there
may
be
cases
where
they
become
legal.
what
i'm
talking
about
is
this.
the
fact
that
something
is
published
on
the
fourth
of
july
does
not
necessarily
prove
it
as
privilege,
and
if
we're
right,
if
you
have
something
more
in
that
concept,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
should
perhaps
explain
a
little
bit
more
for
those
of
us
who
are
trying
to
protect
the
rights
of
litigants
in
this
process.
what
is
and
what
is
not
within
that
concept.
now,
in
new
hampshire,
our
rule
is
that
a
writing
must
be
for
a
proper
purpose
done
in
good
faith
and
based
upon
a
reasonable
belief
in
the
truth
of
what's
being
written,
talking
to
factual
situation
rather
than
the
comment.
that
is
not
--
that
concept
is
not
the
malice
concept
that
is
lack
of
reasonable
--
reasonable
belief
may
be
some
evidence
of
malice
but
even
in
new
hampshire
we
don't
say
that
they're
the
equivalent.
but
if
you're
trying
a
case
that
you
say
is
a
libel
and
it's
a
malicious
libel,
i
am
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
comes
in
and
he
says
he
has
a
qualified
privilege.
by
all
of
the
authorities
that
i
know
of
except
possibly
arizona,
the
fellow
taking
the
position
he
has
that
privilege
has
the
burden
of
proving
his
own
good
faith,
a
justifiable
purpose
of
the
writing
and
that
what
he
wrote
in
the
factual
area
was
based
upon
at
least
some
investigation
sufficient
to
support
a
reasonable
belief
in
the
act
of
substantial
accuracy
of
what
is
right.
now,
this
court's
handling
of
the
henry
cases
seems
to
indicate
that
those
concepts
have
no
part
of
libel,
if
privileges
claim.
now,
if
that
is
so,
it
seems
to
me
where
we
should
be
advised
specifically
that's
all.
now,
if
the
court
is
not
taking
that
position,
if
the
court
is
content
as
the
court
appeared
in
its
footnote
20
to
be
in
sullivan
to
go
along
with
the
state's
version,
state
law
version
in
the
field
of
libel,
those
elements
are
still
part
of
these
cases.
in
new
hampshire,
it's
our
view
that
whether
something
is
written
for
a
proper
purpose
or
whether
it's
written
maliciously,
our
questions
are
fact.
whether
something
was
written
for
justifiable
purpose
or
not
is
a
question
of
fact.
whether
items
that
are
factual,
whether
they
were
based
upon
reasonable
belief
in
what
they
were
written
or
whether
they're
not
are
questions
of
fact.
we
don't
--
we
don't
say
in
my
state
that
those
questions
are
to
be
determined
as
a
matter
of
law
by
some
judge.
if
this
court
is
going
to
that
extent,
i
think
it
should
be
said
plainly.
now,
this
i
think
completes
the
circle
back
to
the
(inaudible)
trial
where
the
quarrel
with
the
government
was
that
the
government
insisted
it
decided
what
law
is
libel.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
no,
i
know
--
i
know
the
rule
of
which
your
honor
makes
reference.
we
never
did
have
it
and
we've
always
charged
the
jury.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
charge
in
this
case
is
pretty
much
typical
of
the
way
that
the
trial
level
that
we
handle
libel
cases.
and
it's
printed
as
an
appendix
of
my
brother's
brief
both
the
supreme
court
decision
and
the
charge
itself.
no,
we
never
went
that
far
judge
black,
but
it's
curious
to
me
that
in
attempting
to
evolve
the
present
concept.
this
court
have
almost
i
think
announced
a
rule
where
the
court
is
going
to
decide
as
a
matter
of
law
that
privilege
does
exist.
now,
the
other
side
of
that
coin,
if
you
decide
as
a
matter
of
law
that
privilege
does
exist,
it's
also
capable
of
legal
determination
that
the
privilege
does
not
exist
and
that
therefore
there
was
a
libel.
now,
that
is
the
concept
that
causes
this
court
was
enunciating
and
applying
in
the
sander
case.
and
the
sander
case
freed
the
press
in
this
country
by
turning
these
factual
issues
and
the
factual
issues
are
what
are
the
intention,
the
purpose,
the
good
faith,
the
malice
or
the
non-malice
in
this
--
in
this
type
of
case
turn
that
or
as
a
function
for
the
jury.
now,
we've
been
over
the
years
quite
proud,
of
our
handling
of
--
of
this
type
of
thing
in
that
manner.
i
think
it's
unfortunate
that
one
area
of
the
country
today
is
exhibiting
uncontrolled
actions
in
this
field.
by
--
i
hesitate
to
think
that
the
rest
of
us
in
other
areas
of
the
country
must
loose
the
rather
salutary
function
of
the
jury
in
this
type
of
case
out
of
deference
to
another
situation
its
not
of
our
making.
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
court
shouldn't
reestablish
as
a
part
of
the
constitutional
concept
that
lawful
occasion
does
connotate
a
publication
in
good
faith
for
a
justifiable
purpose
based
upon
either
reasonable
investigation
of
the
factual
information
or
at
least
the
reasonable
belief
in
substantial
accuracy
of
what
is
being
suggested.
now,
the
other
items
in
my
--
in
our
case,
i
am
content
to
leave
on
the
brief
unless
there
would
have
other
questions.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
belknap
recreational
area
was
a
side
of
a
mountain
in
gilford
just
outside
of
the
city
of
laconia
or
on
the
shores
of
winnipesaukee.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
it's
what
some
200
or
300
acres
now
i
guess
--
about
300
acres.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
and
in
the
wpa
days,
they
sent
unemployed
people
up
there
to
chop
wood
and
in
the
process
of
chopping
wood,
decided
to
do
another
stunt
at
the
same
time
and
that
was
to
clear
some
ski
trails
which
they
did.
they
also
built
a
large
recreational
hall
and
as
a
result
of
some
good
planning
by
one
of
these
county
commissioners
incidentally,
testified
in
this
case,
joe
smith.
they
developed
a
year-round
recreational
area
where
they
have
arts
and
crafts
in
the
summer,
ski
area
in
the
winter.
they
ran
national
motorcycle,
competitive
racing,
as
a
summer
event
and
other
special
events,
largely
recreational
but
some
community
activities
as
well.
we're
going
on
within
this
physical
plan.
now,
depending
upon
what
was
going
on,
mr.
baer
was
actually
the
on-the-spot
man
in
charge.
if
he
had
six
ski
tolls
operating
twice
a
day,
he
would
go
around
and
collect
the
cash
from
them
and
give
the
tickets
out.
he
controlled
the
tickets,
serialized
tickets
to
control
revenues
that
type
of
things.
he
took
the
money
to
the
bank
and
every
week,
he
would
sit
down
with
the
county
commissioners
to
go
over
bills
and
okay
them
and
if
he
said
okay
and
the
commissioners
said
okay,
the
bills
get
paid.
and
that
--
that
essentially
was
his
job.
he
also
had
a
ski
advisory
committee
that
advised
him
as
to
future
development
and
he
would
take
their
suggestion
to
the
commissioners
and
attempt
to
persuade
the
commissioners
to
adopt
those
of
the
recommendations
to
which
he
felt
were
things
within
reach.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
yes,
he
only
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
he
only
had
as
a
permanent
payroll
perhaps
three
to
five
people.
his
--
he
couldn't
--
he
couldn't
hire
people
at
the
dollar-and-a-half
an
hour
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
then
on
weekend,
for
example,
he
would
have
to
pick
up
temporary
help
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
well,
yes
and
no.
he
could
not
hire
anybody
without
the
prior
approval
of
the
commissioners
nor
could
he
fire
without
--
without
their
having
a
right
to
reinstate
the
man.
but
he
was
the
on-the-spot
--
he
was
straw
boss
put
it
that
way
with
apparent
authority
but
no
actual
authority
either
in
fact,
in
law
or
under
his
contract.
and
the
contract
is
--
the
statement
and
parts
of
that
contract
are
printed
in
both
of
the
briefs
and
the
factual
situation
is
briefed
in
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
i
think
that
during
the
period
that
he
was
in
charge
of
the
winter
operation
that
was
his
job.
the
difficulty
would
end
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
it's
hard
to
answer
the
questions
of
that
type,
judge
white,
when
they're
not
in
the
record
and
when
joe
smith
was
one
of
those
commissioners,
because
joe
smith
would
be
up
there
everyday
too.
and
whether
joe
smith
was
agreeing
with
fritzy
baer
or
fritzy
baer
was
agreeing
with
joe
smith,
i
think
would
determine
--
be
determined
by
which
one
you
asked
and
you
might
get
two
different
answers.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
the
commission.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
the
house
county
commissioners.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
that's
correct,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
during
his
tenure
there
were
no
concessionaires
at
all.
they
were
all
--
all
of
the
operations
were
directly
operated
under
his
--
under
his
direct
supervision.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
did
a
--
the
record
will
indicate,
he
did
a
pretty
good
job
for
the
county.
he
picked
the
income
up
from
an
annual
of
about
$50,000
to
more
than
$200,000
without
having
any
real
moneys
available
to
expand.
this
was
just
taking
the
money
and
hug
the
money
and
putting
it
back
in
and
building
up.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
the
situation
in
new
hampshire
judge
fortas
is
that
the
--
the
state
of
new
hampshire
runs
cannon
mountain,
sunapee
mountain
areas.
we
have
privately
--
completely
privately
operated
areas
such
as
mittersill,
jackson,
wildcat.
this
particular
installation
at
gilford
is
the
only
county
operated.
we
have
state
operation,
private
operation
and
the
one
county
operation.
incidentally,
i
think
you
inquired
earlier
as
to
salary
when
fritzy
started
this
job
for
six
hours
a
day
--
six
days
a
week,
eight
hours
a
day.
he
took
the
job
on
at
$6500
and
over
a
ten-year
period,
his
salary
was
increased
from
that
to
eight
from
various
stages.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
yes.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
as
i
recall,
judge
brennan,
neither
my
brother
nor
myself
briefed
nor
did
we
argue
this
point
in
that
court.
and
to
be
perfectly
frank,
the
reason
was
that
situations
have
been
completely
reversed
as
of
the
litiga
--
the
argument
was
even
completely
reversed
as
a
result
of
that.
when
we
were
trying
this
thing
below,
my
brother
was
taking
the
position
that
fritzy
baer
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
this
area
at
all
that
everything
was
being
done
by
the
county
commissioners
and
that
under
his
client,
rosenblatt
was
writing
about,
was
about
the
county
commissioners
not
baer,
you
see?
so
his
position
was
that
baer
was
not
a
county
official
until
--
until
times
and
sullivan
came
in,
and
then
it
became
very
apparent
that
he
was.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
brother
nighswander
wasn't
trying
to
prove
he
was
a
county
official.
i'm
the
one
who
put
the
contract.
so
then
i
wasn't
trying
to
prove
that
he
was
not,
i
was
trying
to
demonstrate
what
his
actual
function
was.
and
the
record,
the
factual
record,
the
evidence
record
is
that
the
only
thing
that
this
man
did
by
himself,
or
he
didn't
have
somebody
looking
over
his
shoulder
was
take
the
money
at
the
bank.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
we
didn't
argue
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
i
think
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
well,
may
i
say
this
judge
brennan,
i
think
that
the
--
my
--
my
own
concept,
i
argued
the
case
in
that
court
too.
i
think
the
situation
is
this.
having
in
mind
that
it
was
virtually
admitted
by
the
defendant
below
that
the
jury
had
found
malice
and
the
court
satisfying
itself
that
malice
was
in
fact
in
this
record
and
i
think
it
is.
i
think
with
that
situation,
the
court
being
satisfied
on
it,
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
and
i
think
at
that
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
i
think
that
that's
a
sensible
explanation.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
as
i
recall
it,
my
brother
nighswander's
brief
was
in
the
process
of
being
put
together
when
times
and
sullivan
became
available
and
it
provoked
an
entirely
new
section
of
your
brief,
did
it
not?
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
little
before
--
it
was
during
the
briefing
for
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
yes,
yes.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
that's
correct.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
yes,
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
the
reserved
case.
our
superior
court
record
will
indicate
we
were
citing
the
sullivan
case
in
the
state
court
for
one
proposition
in
the
charge,
so
that
we
knew
that
it
had
gone
through
the
state
court
and
not
yet
come
here,
and
then
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
yes.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
well,
i
don't
think
that's
quite
so,
judge
black,
because
we
have
a
constitution
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
which
is
just
as
broad
first
amendment
as
the
federal
constitution.
as
you
know,
ours
predated
the
federal
constitution.
we
also
constitutionally
protect
the
man
in
his
remedy
for
injury
to
his
character
in
my
state.
so
that
we
have
both
sides
of
it
on
the
constitutional
basis
and
had
had
it
for
years.
i
think
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
no.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
our
chagnon
case
was
here
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
certiorari
was
denied
in
‘61.
in
other
words,
this
court
did
review
the
new
hampshire
law
in
this
field
in
‘61.
we
then
tried
this
case
assuming
that
our
state
law
having
been
reviewed
here
was
at
least
safe
enough
to
use
the
second
time
around.
and
then
after
the
trial
event
--
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
yes,
chagnon.
oh
yes
and
certiorari
was
denied.
mr.
stanley
m.
brown
i
used
this
--
i
used
the
wrong
expression
sir.
but
i
think
that
having
in
mind,
chagnon
was
here
on
a
petition
which
was
turned
down,
and
then
chagnon
is
cited
and
as
times
case
itself
as
an
example
of
the
similar
state
rule
that
our
situation
in
new
hampshire
is
not
remarkably
different
than
the
developing
concept
that's
being
enunciated
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
we
have
broader
coverage
right
now
as
we
apply
the
qualified
privilege
much
more
broadly
than
this
court
has
yet
announced
it
is
going
to
hear.
we
don't
do
it
quite
the
same
way
procedure
and
that's
all.
