justice
abe
fortas
is
that
contract
in
the
record
from
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
see
you
filed
a
transcript
of
record
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
i
see
the
context
is
in
there.
justice
abe
fortas
and
did
you
just
tell
us
that
at
the
time
that
the
alleged
libel
occurred,
the
respondent
was
employed
on
a
week
to
week
or
month
to
month?
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon,
but
when
--
as
of
the
time
to
which
the
libel
relates,
was
he
employed
on
the
long
--
on
the
term
contract
or
was
he
being
employed
week
to
week?
justice
abe
fortas
and
this
was
after
the
two-year
period?
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
is
this
authority
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
is
this
authority
part-time?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
to
say
they
were
just
citizens
who
were
selected
for
this
purpose.
justice
abe
fortas
and
as
of
the
time
to
which
libel
related,
there
was
a
contract
between
this
authority
and
the
respondent
here,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
brown
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
brown,
excuse
me
sir.
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
record
here
show
that
the
respondent
did
not
take
an
oath
of
office?
justice
abe
fortas
and
does
it
show
whether
he
was
or
was
not
bonded?
justice
abe
fortas
so
actually,
well
is
it
correct
that
this
issue
really
was
not
litigated
below?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
brown,
are
there
any
similar
recreational
areas
in
new
hampshire
which
are
operated
by
a
company
or
an
independent
contractor
on
lease
or
other
arrangement
of
the
state?
