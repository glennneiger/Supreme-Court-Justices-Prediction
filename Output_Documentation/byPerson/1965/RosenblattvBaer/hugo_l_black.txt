many
people,
i
suppose,
would
think
that
if
my
public
image
believed
in
who
are
not
or
treating
animals
cruelly
make
it
to
the
slightest
public
interest
and
say
that
this
man
is
killing
dogs
without
any
reason
for
it,
he's
doing
it
cruelly
and
so
forth.
well,
i
suppose
that
would
be
a
matter
of
--
we
can't
say
that
that
is
not
a
matter
of
public
interest
that
should
be
considered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand.
you
say
your
public
servant
more
important
one
in
some
way
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
has
more
extensive
dealings
for
the
public?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
some
money
with
this
other
man
have
a
dog.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
or
two
questions
about
the
facts
that
i'm
interested
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
is
this
a
county
a
job
or
a
city
job?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
population
of
the
county?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
an
industrial
county?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
salary
paid
for
this
job
one
that
makes
it
rather
competitive
and
many
people
would
like
to
have
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
it
perform
any
other
task?
are
there
any
other
duties
or
is
he
limited
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
(voice
overlap)
it's
a
rather
important
job
of
the
new
community.
justice
hugo
l.
black
accepted
as
a
rather
important
job
of
the
new
community.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
reason
of
the
summer
recreation
purposes
and
so
forth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
it's
an
unpaid
column?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
man's
business
who
wrote
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
regularly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
regularly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
is
this
man's
employment
terminable
at
will
of
the
county
commissioners?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
they
tell
him
not
to
tell
the
public?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
what
is
a
public
official
going
to
the
state
law
in
order
to
find
out
what
he
is
indicating
it
might
be
a
different
character
in
50
different
states.
it
doesn't
indicate
that
you're
not
going
to
get
the
certainty
you
deserve
if
there's
--
if
these
constitutional
boundaries
made
to
public
officials
and
the
protection
of
the
constitution
may
be
taken
away
by
having
50
defini
--
definitions
of
public
officials
in
50
different
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
talking
about
a
constitutional
law
which
is
that
varied
by
what
the
law
in
the
different
states.
as
a
standard,
doesn't
it
indicate
that
maybe
--
maybe
the
court
did
not
mean
to
draw
the
line
or
harden
the
first
line
by
use
of
the
label
of
public
official
which
could
be
changed
--
which
should
be
different
in
50
different
names
in
50
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
have
to
say
they're
all
public
officials.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
could
just
that
--
you
could
just
say
that
the
rule
--
the
constitutional
applies
(voice
overlap).
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
your
argument
has
considerable
sympathy
but
try
to
make
it
distinct
with
some
degree
of
certainty
that
what
i
was
pointing
out
was
that
you
didn't
quite
get
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
at
least
if
you
did
by
what
you're
saying,
it
would
be
50
different
tests
in
50
different
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
does
the
new
hampshire
have
constitutional
provision
which
has
many
states
have
or
did
have,
or
did
new
hampshire
ever
have
that
provision
that
the
jury
being
the
judge
of
both
the
law
in
the
practical
libel
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
this
--
how
did
this
became
necessary?
didn't
it
become
essential
if
you
look
at
it
in
a
view?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
old
libel
law
that
were
built
--
that
were
made
either
by
the
state
legislature
or
by
the
state
courts
formulated
what
was
libel
that
ended
it.
there
was
no
federal
question
until
the
time
came
when
this
court
held
that
the
first
amendment
was
made
applicable
to
the
state
that
raised
a
new
issue.
what
you
--
what
you're
--
what
i
understand
you
all
have
done
is
to
try
a
case
on
the
basis
of
the
old
libel
law
where
little
effect
was
given
to
the
first
amendment
because
until
it
was
held
applicable
to
the
states
there's
no
reason
to
it,
he
didn't
raise
a
federal
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
wouldn't
affect
our
interpretation
of
the
federal
provision
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
you
have
now
is
a
situation
where
it's
been
held
applicable
to
the
state
as
whatever
meaning
it
has
under
the
federal
constitution
and
that's
created
in
your
situation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
it
was
reviewed
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
but
that's
not
a
review.
