justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
casey,
am
i
looking
at
the
right
paragraph
four
at
page
2?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
now
that's
--
as
i
--
i
see
here
is
the
alternative,
tearing
down
or
smashing
and
destroying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
you
said
earlier,
the
order
was
addressed
--
coming
to
the
company
by
mail?
i
know
that
this
is
an
examiner's
--
what's
--
this
at
page
2?
is
that
the
[inaudible]
--
the
reason
i
asked
is
that
the
paragraph
4
appears
under
a
heading,
addressed
to
the
company
and
officers,
agents,
representatives
and
employees?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
go
on.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
the
--
are
you
making
a
distinction
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
--
where
is
that?
is
that
the
one
on
page
3?
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
page
3
and
4
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
that's
an
order
and
your
point
is
that
the
commission
sought
enforcement,
sought
enforcement
only
as
respect
to
the
company,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
kind
of
a
hearing
was
held
in
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
that
you
--
you
demanded
a
jury
trial
but
was
denied?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
don't
interrupt
your
course
of
argument,
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
obviously
the
company
could
not
have
--
the
company
has
not
[inaudible]
and
i
see
at
page
20,
this
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
there
is
a
pungent
evidence
in
which
he
finds
that
cheff
has
initiated
it.
he's
a
dominant
metropolitan
business
in
the
period
during
which
holland
sales
[inaudible]
subject
to
cease
and
order,
[inaudible]
dominant
[inaudible]
from
the
commission's
theory,
which
conducts
the
cease
and
desist
order
issued
in
august
5,
1959,
an
order
filed
in
1959
was
entered.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
wonder,
who
could
have
made
these
admissions
on
behalf
of
holland?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
this
is
--
as
justice
clark
has
referred
to
you,
holland
furnace
company
admits
the
violation.
who
could
have
made
that
on
behalf
of
holland?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
in
this
mr.
casey,
i
noticed
at
the
top
of
page
17,
the
court
of
appeals
said
--
commission's
order
was
directed,
was
it
not,
aid
as
well
as
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
says,
the
commission's
order
is
enforced
by
this
court's
august
5,
1959
order,
remained
in
full
force
and
effect
and
was
made
permanent
by
this
court's
affirmance
of
the
commission
order
of
november
7,
1961.
so
i
gather
that
the
court
at
least
thought,
with
its
enforcement
order
that
you
point
out,
namely
from
the
company,
nevertheless,
it's
intended
to
be
at
a
doctrine
of
the
form
of
the
commission's
order
which
painted
the
position
of
the
company
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
point
is
that's
not
enough
of
a
ground
of
criminal
contempt.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
lewin,
does
that
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
the
order
should
not
give
one
notice
to
the
fact
that
the
--
this
conduct
may
come
within
its
scope?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
it
has
to
go
up
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
order
the
court
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
is
the
sentence
--
mr.
casey
is
right
about
it,
that
that
is
at
least
in
turn,
that
that's
only
to
the
company,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
for
whatever
its
worth,
the
order
that
the
petitioner
is
charged
with
having
violated,
therefore
guilty
of
contempt,
does
not
in
turn
--
does
not
it
turn
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
one
to
which
--
with
the
contempt
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
where
is
aiding
and
abetting
acts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
a
crime
[inaudible]
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
criminal
contempt
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
crime
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
did
that
follow
mr.
lewin
--
what's
happening,
the
government
treats
a
criminal
contempt
when
it
suits
its
purposes
as
a
crime
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
when
it
doesn't
(voice
overlap),
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
know
but
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it's
the
attorney
general
who
issued
the
letter.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you're
--
here's
the
representative
of
the
attorney
general.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
actually
--
what
kind
of
hearing
was
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
apparently,
there
are
a
number
of
stipulations
from
what
the
record
indicates
at
page
18,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
they
take
the
stand
themselves?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
petitioner?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
were
the
counsels
appointed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally
mr.
lewin,
you
said
that
these
proceedings
had
been
rare,
have
others
also
resulted
in
jail
sentences?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
you
said
that
this
has
happened
only
rarely
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
looks
though
as
the
first
jail
sentence
in
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
congress
of
course
have
said
though
in
some
instances
of
that,
they
must
given
that
kind
of
court
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alleged
violation
must
be
submitted
to
a
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
you're
also
saying
that
the
--
if
there
must
be
a
jury
trial,
alleged
violations
of
an
order
like
this
and
constitutionally
that's
required,
that
that
also
would
obtain
as
to
all
injunction
orders
of
any
kind,
are
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
this
file
i
gather
was
before
the
judges
whose
order
is
claimed
to
be
violated.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
other
different
panel
[inaudible]
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
different
panel
on
the
file
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
for
judge
schnackenberg.
