justice
abe
fortas
mr.
casey,
i'm
a
little
confused
about
the
dates.
did
you
say
that
on
july
7,
1962,
holland
furnace
company
was
taken
over
or
was
that
1963?
justice
abe
fortas
and
when
did
--
did
the
petitioner
continued
with
the
new
company
for
any
period
of
time
on
new
management?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sorry
to
take
your
time
but
when
did
the
petitioner's
connection
with
the
company
terminated,
if
it
did?
justice
abe
fortas
may
1962
and
did
he
then
cease
to
be
an
officer,
director
--
or
director?
justice
abe
fortas
did
he
--
was
he
a
stockholder?
justice
abe
fortas
was
he
a
large
stockholder?
does
the
record
show?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
casey,
may
i
detain
you
a
moment.
mr.
casey
at
the
time
these
admissions
were
made
on
behalf
of
the
company,
your
petitioner
--
the
petitioner
was
no
longer
president
of
the
company,
was
he?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
admissions
on
behalf
of
the
company
may
have
been
authorized
by
the
new
management.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
lewin,
there
is
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
justice
abe
fortas
there's
been
a
reference
here
to
an
order
of
the
court,
i
take
it
of
november,
i
guess
november
of
1959.
was
there
such
an
order
and
it's
not
in
the
record
so
far
as
i
can
see.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
that
but
there
is
a
claim
--
justice
abe
fortas
which
is
the
order,
the
august
1959?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
then
you
tell
me
that
there
was
another
order
entered
by
the
court
and
the
--
did
that
order
affirm
the
commission's
order
or
confirm
the
commission's
order?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
--
i'm
sorry,
but
that
--
that's
not
in
this
record
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
this
that
as
of
the
time
of
the
alleged
violations,
was
there
or
was
there
not
a
court
order
generally
confirming
or
affirming
the
federal
trade
commission
order?
justice
abe
fortas
there
was
not.
so
that
as
of
the
time
of
the
alleged
violations,
the
only
court
order
was
the
order
of
august
5,
1959
and
that
order
merely
denied
the
petition
of
the
corporate
respondent
in
the
federal
trade
commission?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see
but
the
case
was
before
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
petition
--
on
the
petition
of
the
furnace
company.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
lewin,
before
you
get
to
that,
can
you
tell
us
whether
this
is
customary
that
is
to
say
on
contempt
proceedings,
the
violation
of
a
court
order
following
an
administrative
order,
is
it
customary
for
those
to
be
informed
of
criminal
contempt?
what
is
the
practice?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
source
[inaudible]
there
is
an
analysis
of
what
the
practice
has
been
in
this
respect?
that
is
to
say,
what
the
practices
of
various
agencies
in
the
various
courts?
i
realize
that
there
aren't
many
cases.
justice
abe
fortas
well
there
are
certain
types
of
orders
certainly
entered
by
the
federal
trade
commission
in
which
that
would
not
be
quite
so,
wouldn't
it
and
that
so,
that
is
to
say
that
the
order
of
the
federal
trade
commission
says
cease
and
desist
from
a
specified
coercive
conduct.
the
respondent
fails
to
do
that
and
there
is
a
civil
contempt
in
which
penalty
is
imposed,
an
imprisonment
for
whatnot
until
the
prescribed
course
of
conduct
is
effectively
abandoned.
in
other
words
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
i
take
it
from
what
you've
said
a
moment
that
you're
really
arguing
that
civil
contempt
is
not
a
suitable
or
effective
remedy
and
i
wonder
if
that
is
so.
it's
not
a
suitable
or
effective
remedy
when
there
is
a
one
shot
violation
and
you
want
to
punish
somebody
and
there,
the
question
is,
“should
there
or
should
there
not
be
a
jury
trial?”
but
then
you
have
other
types
of
orders
perhaps
in
which
the
respondent
is
commanded
to
cease
a
described
course
of
conduct
and
he
doesn't
do
so,
he
is
subjected
to
a
sanction
until
he
shows
that
he
has
complied.
justice
abe
fortas
was
not
--
i
suggest
that
perhaps
it's
not
quite
as
simple
as
that,
but
are
you
in
effect
submitting
to
us
the
proposition
that
civil
contempt
is
not
suitable
with
respect
to
the
trade
commission
orders?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
a
pretty
dangerous
statement,
isn't
it?
you
don't
really
mean
that.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
lewin,
i
suppose
this
is
a
boiler
plate
federal
trade
commission
order,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
not
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
it's
got
the
general
provisions
in
that
statutory
language,
isn't
it,
the
federal
trade
commission
order
here?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
talking
about
the
order
of
the
court
in
that
--
the
moment
--
justice
abe
fortas
where
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
well
let's
take
an
order
of
the
federal
trade
commission
that
is
in
statutory
terms,
you've
seen
a
lot
of
them
and
i
have
too,
that's
in
the
general
terms
of
the
statute
and
let's
suppose
that
the
court
implements
that
with
an
enforcement
order
which
is
in
general
terms
like
the
order
here.
now
certainly,
if
there
is
a
claim
or
violation,
that
raises
questions
of
fact,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
--
and
then
the
question
arises
as
to
how
those
facts
should
be
determined
for
the
purpose
of
punitive
action
resulting
in
somebody
going
to
jail,
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it's
not
as
if
we
were
talking
about
--
perhaps
it's
not
‘as
if',
we
were
talking
about
a
clear
specific
rifle
shot
court
order.
here
we're
talking
about
a
court
order
that
enforces
what
i
expect
you'd
agree
is
frequently
a
very
general
administrative
order.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
can
he
make
that
defense
to
the
jury,
to
a
jury
or
does
he
--
is
he
confined
to
making
that
defense
to
the
judges,
i
think
that's
our
issue.
