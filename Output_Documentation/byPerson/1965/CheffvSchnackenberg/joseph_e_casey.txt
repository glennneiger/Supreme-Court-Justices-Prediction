mr.
joseph
e.
casey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
make
a
comment
about
rather
trivial,
but
recent
development.
last
night
when
i
returned
to
my
office
about
4
o'clock,
i
found
a
bare
copy
of
a
letter
from
the
office
of
the
solicitor
general
unsigned
which
was
addressed
to
the
clerk
of
court
saying,
dear
mr.
davis,
the
underlying
decision
of
the
federal
trade
commission
in
this
case
which
is
officially
reported
at
55
f.
t.
c.
55
does
not
appear
in
the
printed
record.
for
the
convenience
of
the
court
during
oral
argument,
we
had
reproduced
in
a
--
transmitting
sufficient
copies
for
its
distribution.
the
petitioner
is
not
a
party
to
that
proceeding.
the
petitioner
is
here
because
he
was
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
a
violation
of
a
court
order.
and
the
--
i've
merely
voice
my
objection
because
i
think
that
it
gives
this
document
which
can
be
based
on
different
evidentiary
rules
from
what
we
have
in
courts
a
prominence
and
the
significance
which
it
doesn’t
deserve
but
i'm
sure
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
this
case
arose
out
of
a
federal
trade
commission
cease
and
desist
order
against
holland
furnace
company.
the
date
was
august
5th,
1959.
holland
furnace
company
was
engaged
in
the
business
of
selling
furnaces,
retailing
them
in
what
is
known
as
the
replacement
of
furnaces.
their
salesmen
made
house
to
house
calls.
it
was
a
company
that
was
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
at
the
time.
it
did
business
in
44
different
states.
it
had
500
branch
offices
and
5000
salesmen.
and
the
--
at
that
time
was
doing
a
gross
business
of
$30
million
a
year.
the
petitioner
was
president
and
chairman
of
the
board.
the
--
after
the
cease
and
desist
order
of
august
5th,
1959,
the
holland
furnace
company
initiated
proceedings
before
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
review
the
commission's
cease
and
desist
order.
it
was
during
those
proceedings
that
the
federal
trade
commission
through
its
attorney
asked
for
a
pendente
lite
order
against
holland
furnace
company,
which
was
issued.
that
was
issued
august
5th,
1959.
the
cease
and
desist
order
of
the
commission
was
dated
july
7th,
1958,
but
the
pendente
lite
order,
august
5th,
1959
is
the
one
which
the
petitioner
is
charged
with
having
violated.
now,
i
make
a
point
of
the
fact
that
the
commission's
cease
and
desist
order
was
against
holland
furnace
company.
the
petitioner
was
not
a
party
to
it.
the
cease
and
desist
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
august
5th,
1959
was
against
the
holland
furnace
company,
not
even
reciting
agents,
representatives
and
so
forth
and
the
petitioner
was
not
a
party
to
it.
the
pendente
lite
order
against
the
holland
furnace
company
was
made
permanent
on
november
7th,
1961.
now,
the
holland
furnace
company
on
may
1962
had
been
taken
over
by
a
new
management.
the
new
management
on
july
27th,
1962
discontinued
business
of
replacing
furnaces
went
out
of
that
portion
of
the
business
wherein
violations
had
been
charged.
this
is
july
27th,
1962.
on
april
19th,
1963,
the
federal
trade
commission
petitioned
the
court
of
appeals
to
institute
prosecutions
of
additional
respondents,
including
the
petitioner
and
10
others,
to
institute
prosecutions
for
criminal
contempt
of
some
11
additional
respondents.
these
respondents
were
officers
of
the
company,
directors
of
the
company,
stockholders
of
the
company.
this
was
a
rather
startling
venture
for
the
federal
trade
commission
to
embark
upon
to
petition
for
the
institution
of
criminal
contempt
against
officers,
directors
and
stockholders
of
a
company.
at
a
date
some
six
months
after
there
had
been
a
complete
compliance
with
this
order,
i
say
complete
compliance
because
in
july
27th,
the
new
management,
first
of
all,
the
petitioner
resigned
in
may
1962.
the
new
management
took
over
what
was
once
a
prosperous
company
but
now
a
company
that
they
took
over
i
think
for
dissolution
and
discharged
of
the
salesmen,
discharged
all
of
the
branch
salesmen,
closed
down
the
factory
so
that
there
was
compliance
complete
and
absolute
as
of
july
27th,
1963.
and
on
april
19,
when
this
petition
for
the
first
time
was
instituted
to
prosecute
these
individuals,
officers,
stockholders
and
directors
of
the
company,
there
had
been
complete
enforcement,
in
fact
the
company
was
not
in
that
type
of
business
in
which
the
violations
occurred.
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
no,
the
holland
furnace
company
was
taken
over
in
may
1962
and
on
july
27th,
1962,
the
holland
furnace
company
did
all
of
these
things,
discharged
the
salesmen,
the
branch
--
the
branch
officers
and
so
forth,
on
july
27th,
1962.
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
well,
the
business
continued
under
the
new
management
and
the
holland
furnace
company
the
petition
for
certiorari,
which
was
denied,
but
stated
that
it
had
some
furnaces
on
hand
and
some
bills
to
collect,
and
so
forth.
so
it
may
have
continued,
but
in
any
event,
it
did
not
continue
in
this
field
of
utilizing
salesmen
to
make
house
to
house
calls.
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
may
1962.
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
that
is
correct
justice
fortas.
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
i
think
he
may
have
been
a
stockholder.
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
i
don't
think
the
record
show
he
was
a
large
stockholder.
in
fact
i
don't
know
whether
he
owned
any
stock
after
the
purchase.
i
think
probably
the
new
management
had
purchased
his
stock
and
other
stock
in
order
to
get
control.
now
the
petition
for
the
institution
of
prosecution
is
interesting
in
the
way
that
it
is
drawn
up.
it
says,
“comenoley
attorneys
appointed
here
and
to
prosecute
on
behalf
of
the
court
and
respectfully
petition
the
court
to

code,
and

with

(b)

the
rules
of

procedure
for

courts”.
prosecutions
[inaudible]
and
then
it
names
all
of
the
11
individuals
for
criminal
contempt
of
this
court
and
to
adjudge
them
in
--
and
to
adjudge
them
to
be
in
and
punish
them
for
criminal
contempt
by
reason
of
their
having
severally
and
jointly,
knowingly,
willfully
and
intentionally
caused
negative
impediment,
the
holland
furnace
company
to
violate
the
order
of
the
court
entered
on
august
5th,
1959.
i
call
attention
to
the
court
if
i
may
that
in
that
same
petition
for
institution
of
prosecution,
the
charges
that
they
fail
and
refuse
to
comply
with
the
order
of
the
court
during
the
period
from
august
5th,
1959
until
december
31st,
1961.
and
the
--
may
i
say
that
that
is
a
period
16
months.
there
are
25
violations
charged
here.
this
large
company
with
5000
salesmen
during
a
period
of
16
months,
with
salesmen
at
a
minimum
of
10
a
week
would
bring
the
total
number
of
calls
to
3.5
million
calls
and
only
25
violations
out
of
this
charge.
the
violations
which
appear
on
page
2
of
the
record
are
8
in
number
and
they
prohibit
the
employees
from
representing
--
they
are
government
agencies,
they
have
a
--
or
but
they
are
salesmen,
or
that
they
are
heating
con
engineers.
in
this
connection
i
would
like
to
note
that
in
the
respondent's
brief
on
page
4,
i'm
now
taking
the
fourth
prohibition
in
that
order
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
the
fourth
prohibition
is
the
outstanding
one.
the
fourth
prohibition
is
the
one
that
got
all
the
publicity.
the
fourth
prohibition
is
the
trumpet
that
dropped
the
walls
of
holland
furnace
company
tumbling
down.
it
says
tearing
down
or
dismantling
any
furnace
without
the
permission
of
the
owner.
on
page
4
--
in
the
respondent's
brief,
say
4
is
dismantling
furnaces
without
the
--
without
the
owner's
permission.
now,
there
is
a
vast
difference,
dismantling
is
a
gentle
procedure
of
taking
a
part
of
furnace
and
keeping
of
the
parts
intact.
tearing
down
is
a
smashing
and
destroying,
and
tearing
down
is
not
petty,
it
is
not
trivial,
it
is
an
offense
punishable
at
common
law.
its
punishable
in
the
state
of
ohio
where
it
is
alleged
--
had
gone
to
whether
this
offense
but
some
of
these
are
supposed
to
have
happened
on
four
different
occasions
by
a
statute
which
punishes
it
by
as
much
as
20
years
imprisonment.
so,
i
don’t
know
whether
the
omission
of
tearing
down
from
the
respondent's
brief
was
due
to
a
twinge
of
conscience
or
to
inadvertence
but
i
certainly
wanted
--
understood
that
the
fourth
prohibition
is
tearing
down
which
is
a
crime
at
common
law,
which
is
a
felony,
and
which
is
punishable
in
--
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
that's
your
honor
the
transcript
of
the
record?
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
that
is
right.
that
is
right
but
i
submit
that
that
includes
some
tearing
down.
in
any
event
--
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
that's
the
commission's
--
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
--
cease
and
desist
order.
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
that
the
court
of
appeals'
--
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
--
cease
and
desist
order
did
not
represent
anything
but
the
company.
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
that's
the
august
5th,
1959
on
page
--
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
--
three.
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
versus
holland
furnace
company,
yes.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
yes
justice
brennan
that's
exactly
my
position.
now
may
i
turn
my
attention
to
the
contempt
in
administrative
law
cases
because
i
believe
that
in
these
administrative
cases,
the
contempt
is
civil
not
criminal.
congress
passed
a
great
many
acts
creating
these
administrative
agencies
and
providing
for
their
enforcement
by
the
circuits
court
of
appeals.
now
congress
knew
that
when
it
created
these
agencies
for
the
national
labor
relation
board,
the
federal
power
act,
the
federal
trade,
the
interstate
commerce,
that
it
was
dealing
with
businesses,
that
it
was
dealing
with
the
particulars
and
the
details
of
the
business
life
of
america.
congress
knew
that
it
was
not
setting
up
any
sort
of
a
criminal
estoppel.
it
did
not
create
these
agencies
in
order
to
send
individuals
to
jail.
it
set
these
agencies
up
in
order
to
regulate
and
bring
order
to
do
business
and
it
was
a
modern
invention
of
congress.
in
the
hearings
before
these
agencies
for
example,
before
these
examiners
which
--
any
evidence
is
admitted,
the
rules
of
relevancy
are
suspended,
proof
by
a
fair
preponderance
or
reasonable
doubt
is
foreign
to
the
hearings
and
so
if
congress
intended
to
put
--
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
this
hearing
with
respect
to
the
petitioner
and
the
11
respondents,
there
was
a
hearing
and
--
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
there
was
a
hearing
and
--
but
previous
to
that
hearing,
i
would
like
to
state
--
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
--
state
--
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
that
there
was
a
--
that
the
petitioner
filed
a
general
denial
and
the
attorneys
for
the
federal
trade
commission
appointed
by
the
court
to
prosecute
who
initiated
this
proceeding
were
apparently
disturbed
by
the
fact
that
it
was
a
general
denial,
because
on
page
12
of
the
report,
the
prosecution's
reply
to
answer
says,
"come
now
the
attorneys
appointed
to
prosecute
on
behalf
of
the
court"
and
by
way
of
reply
to
the
answer
filed
herein
on
august
26th,
1963
by
respondent
paul
theodore
cheff,
respectfully
advised
the
court
that
said
respondent
has
by
said
answer,
denied
each
and
all
allegations
in
the
petition
filed
herein
by
court
appointed
counsel
on
april
19th,
1963.
and
otherwise
has
reserved
his
defense
and
that
in
the
view
of
court
appointed
counsel,
the
evidence
indicated
in
said
petition
and
in
other
documents
herein
to
be
available
with
respect
to
this
respondent
is
sufficient
in
fact
and
in
law
to
establish
that
the
has
committed
a
criminal
contempt
of
this
court
as
charged
in
the
said
petition.
now
it
goes
on
and
says
--
asked
the
court
to
determine
that
respondent
cheff
having
been
afforded
an
opportunity
to
make
preliminary
showing
why
he
should
not
be
adjudged
in
criminal
contempt
of
this
court,
has
not
so
shown,
but
the
court
after
such
further
proceedings
as
it
determines
to
be
just
and
appropriate,
adjudged
respondent
paul
theodore
cheff
in
criminal
contempt
of
this
court
and
punished
him
for
such
criminal
contempt
in
such
manner
as
this
court
deems
just
and
proper.
this
proceeding
has
all
the
earmarks
of
a
claim,
criminal
prosecution
and
i
contend
that
in
these
administrative
agencies
the
enforcement
process
is
contempt,
but
that
contempt
is
civil.
for
example,
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
as
free
in
its
actions
when
it
deals
with
one
of
these
enforcement
orders
that
come
from
the
federal
trade
because
they're
compelled.
they're
compelled
to
take
over
the
enforcement
of
these
--
of
the
agency
if
there
is
any
war
in
the
record
or
reasonable
basis
involved
because
the
agency's
attorneys
who
are
appointed
by
the
court,
the
court
has
no
investigators,
the
court
doesn't
drop
these
petitions
and
orders.
there's
an
overlooking
and
a
complete
cooperation
between
the
agency
and
the
court.
so,
the
evidence
that
is
used
in
these
cases
is
not
the
usual
type
of
evidence
before
a
court.
for
example,
in
this
particular
case
if
you
will
notice
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
finding
this
respondent
guilty
of
criminal
contempt
sets
forth
some
reasons
and
as
a
basis
upon
which
their
decision
is
predicated
that
are
very
difficult
to
follow.
now,
i
listened
yesterday
to
the
respondent,
the
government
attorney
say
that
the
difference
between
the
contempt
and
a
crime,
an
ordinary
crime,
is
that
contempt
crimes
are
refined
with
great
accuracy
and
the
conduct
that
is
proscribed
is
very
definite,
so
that
you
know
what
is
proscribed
and
you
know
what
is
required,
what
is
forbidden
and
what
is
required.
now,
at
--
on
the
record
at
18
--
15,
you
find
that
the
court
bases
its
opinion
on
such
things
as
--
speaking
about
the
petitioner,
he
did
not
travel
about
to
meet
with
better
business
bureaus.
now
there
is
nothing
in
the
cease
and
desist
order
that
says
he
should
travel
about
meeting
with
better
business
bureaus.
he
didn't
take
pains
to
see
that
his
entire
sales
organization
understood
the
seriousness
of
compliance
as
his
successors
did
by
bringing
2000
salesmen
to
holland
michigan.
there's
nothing
in
the
cease
and
desist
order
that
would
indicate
they
should
do
that.
that
he
worked
on
replacement
of
furnaces
instead
of
original
furnace
market.
the
cease
and
desist
order
doesn't
order
them
to
go
out
of
the
replacement
business.
that
he
hired
salesmen
on
a
commission
basis.
the
order
could
have
forbade
him
to
hire
salesmen
on
a
commission
basis
but
it
says
nothing
about
it.
that
he
got
higher
prices
for
holland
furnace
than
its
competitors.
that
he
remained
aloof
from
sales
managers
and
salesmen
and
he
is
the
president
of
this
large
company
and
the
chairman
of
the
board.
and
the
--
with
a
conviction
predicated
upon
this
unforeseeable
ex
post
facto
expansion
of
the
narrow
requirements
of
the
court
order.
mr.
joseph
e.
casey

mr.
joseph
e.
casey
justice
clark,
what
page
were
you
reading
from?
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
that
is
--
the
holland
furnace
company
admits.
petitioner
never
admitted
that
and
there
is
the
--
a
great
difference
here.
it's
one
thing
that
it
was
--
to
charge
this
furnace
company
with
responsibility
for
a
violation
if
any
salesman
makes
a
violation,
but
it's
another
thing
to
charge
an
officer
of
the
company
or
a
stockholder
of
the
company
or
a
director
of
the
company
with
causing
that
violation.
there
is
a
great
gulf
between
the
two.
there
is
that
lack
of
the
causative
link
between
the
two
and
the
petitioner
does
not
admit
of
course
that
he
ever
caused
any
violations.
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
oh,
there's
no
question
about
what
they
--
they
needn't
be
abundant
evidence.
we
have
always
admitted
that
he
was
--
he
was
the
head
of
the
holland
furnace
company.
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
i
don't
think
that
was
an
admission.
i
think
that
that
comes
from
the
federal
trade
commission
attorneys.
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
well,
i
have
no
idea
who
made
those
in
behalf
of
holland?
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
i
think
that
petition
by
the
federal
trade
commission
attorneys
was
instituted
at
a
much
later
date.
the
first
time
the
petitioner
comes
in,
it
was
--
is
on
april
19th,
1963
when
there
is
a
petition
asking
the
court
to
prosecute
cheff
for
criminal
contempt.
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
that's
right
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
that's
--
that
is
correct
justice
brennan.
although
that
august
5th
--
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
the
august
5th
has
not
enough
ground
for
criminal
contempt
and
my
point
is
that
in
all
these
administrative
agency
proceedings
in
national
labor
relation
board,
it
should
be
wholly
civil.
i
see
time
has
expired.
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
that
is
correct,
justice
fortas.
mr.
joseph
e.
casey
that
is
correct.
that
is
--
that
is
absolutely
correct
because
the
petitioner
was
not
in
the
company
at
the
time
the
institution
of
these
criminal
proceedings.
