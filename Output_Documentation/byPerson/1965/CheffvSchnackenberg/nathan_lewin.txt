mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
limited
writ
of
certiorari
presenting
the
single
question
whether
it
was
constitutionally
permissible
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
sentence
petitioner
to
six
months
imprisonment
for
criminal
contempt
of
its
order
after
having
denied
his
request
for
a
trial
by
jury.
our
view
as
to
that
single
question
presented
and
before
the
court,
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
should
be
affirmed
because
criminal
contempt
is
not
a
crime
within
the
meaning
of
article
iii,
section
2
of
the
constitution,
or
a
criminal
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment.
that
proposition
in
turn
is
based
on
the
historical
premise
that
the
constitutional
draftsmen
did
not
view
contempt
as
a
crime
or
a
criminal
prosecution
and
on
our
view
that
there
are
meaningful
differences
today
between
the
ordinary
criminal
prosecution
which
involves
the
violation
of
a
criminal
statute
in
a
contempt
proceeding
which
involves
violation
of
a
court
order.
now,
there
is
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
think
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
order
certainly
has
to
go
that
far
and
we
think
the
order
in
this
case
certainly
did
go
that
far.
they
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
company
was
the
only
party
at
the
--
before
the
court.
at
that
stage,
the
company
was
the
only
party
before
the
federal
trade
commission
but
of
course,
the
federal
trade
commission
in
its
orders
as
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
i
think
as
courts
do,
recognize
that
corporations
act
through
their
dominant
officers.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
court
of
appeals'
order
is
not
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
though
that
there's
one
distinction
that
should
be
borne
in
mind
in
this
regard,
and
that
is
that
the
petitioner
was
convicted
not
of
directly
violating
this
order,
but
of
aiding
and
abetting
the
corporation
and
of
causing
the
corporation
to
violate
the
order.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
not
aiding
and
abetting
in
the
sense
necessarily
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
we
think
those
who
assist
or
who
cause
to
violate
--
a
violation
of
a
court
order
are
--
have
themselves
committed
contempt.
this
court
recognized
as
much
quite
sometime
ago
back
in
221
u.s.
in
wilson
versus
united
states
which
we
quote
at
pages
16
and
17
of
our
brief
where
the
court
specifically
said
that,
"the
command
for
the
corporation
is
in
effect
a
command
to
those
who
are
officially
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
its
affairs.
if
they
apprised
of
the
writ
directed
to
the
corporation
prevent
compliance
or
fail
to
take
appropriate
action
within
their
power
to
the
performance
of
a
corporate
duty,
they
no
less
than
the
corporation
itself
are
guilty
of
disobedience
and
may
be
punished
for
--
‚Äù
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
think
it
was
a
criminal
contempt
case,
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
it
was
a
criminal
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
but
--
that
the
--
that's
true
mr.
justice
brennan
but
we
think
that
the
court
did
say
that
they
may
be
punished
contempt
in
that
case.
and
we
think
that
the
only
meaningful
way
to
interpret
an
order
direct
into
a
corporation
and
in
the
--
to
give
effect
would
be
to
say
that
those
who
dominate
the
corporation
who
conduct
its
affairs
and
who
are
in
effect
responsible
for
what
it
does
must
be
held
responsible
in
contempt
or
liable
for
contempt
punishment
as
well
as
the
nominal
corporation
itself.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
order
of
which
petitioner
was
convicted
of
having
violated
was
a
pendente
lite
order
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
was
entered
in
april
of
1959.
after
review
of
the
administrative
proceedings
and
the
order
to
the
federal
trade
commission,
the
court
of
appeals
entered
a
second
order
in
which
it
made
permanent
its
earlier
order.
now
that's
not
in
this
record
because
that's
not
the
order
which
he
was
convicted
of
having
violated.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i'm
sorry,
august
1959.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
meant
august
of
1959,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
august
1959
order
is
the
pendente
lite
order.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
did.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
not
in
this
record
because
it
was
committed.
it
--
that
it
was
--
petitioner
was
not
--
is
--
he
was
not
convicted
of
having
violated
that
second
order.
all
the
acts
of
contempt
that
were
committed
and
that
were
put
into
evidence
in
this
case
before
the
court
of
appeals
were
acts
that
were
committed
between
the
entry
of
the
pendente
lite
order
in
august
1959
and
the
entry
of
the
final
order
in
november
of
1961.
in
other
words,
the
contempt
was
limited
to
that
period
during
which
the
pendente
lite
order
was
outstanding.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
there
was
not.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
order
was
entered
at
the
request
of
the
federal
trade
commission
to
enjoin
this
kind
of
conduct
which
it
had
found
had
been
committed
at
some
time
previously
pending
the
seventh
circuit's
determination
of
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
and
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
the
harm
to
the
public
interest
if
this
conduct
continued
in
that
interim
was
great
enough
to
warrant
entering
a
interlocutory
or
pendente
lite
order
as
of
that
time.
mr.
nathan
lewin
definitely
before
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
definitely
before
the
seventh
circuit,
on
the
company's
petition
to
review.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
have
the
opinion
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
were
--
we
are
making
copies
of
it
at
the
department
of
justice
and
we'll
be
delivering
it
to
the
court
this
afternoon.
i
hadn't
realized
that
the
court
would
want
it
for
this
morning's
argument
and
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
believe
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
letter
really
turns
on
the
construction
of
a
particular
regulation,
which
does
define
crime.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
treats
it
as
a
crime
for
purposes
of
that
regulation,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
regulation
provided
that
--
for
purpose
--
that
those
who
were
convicted
of
any
federal,
state,
or
a
crime
before
a
court-martial
and
imprisoned
for
five
years
pursuant
to
such
a
--
such
convictions
would
--
could
not
be
in
turned
at
arlington
or
a
national
cemetery.
mr.
nathan
lewin
according
to
that
letter
to
the
attorney
general,
we
did,
yes
sir,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
i
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
think
it
does.
i
think
--
let
me
say,
let
me
say
at
the
outset
that
of
course
we
hadn't
--
mr.
spritzer
yesterday,
hadn't
seen
that
letter
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
there
was
no
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
but
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
true
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
that
there
is
a
difference
though
between
that
regulation
and
the
way
it
was
framed
and
the
usual
constitutional
definition
of
a
crime
because
that
regulation
includes
as
well
not
merely
federal
and
state
crimes,
but
also
convictions
before
court-martial.
now,
for
example,
that's
not
a
crime.
this
court
has
so
held
for
sixth
amendment
purposes
and
yet
the
regulation
is
entirely
clear
in
treating
that
as
a
crime
for
purposes
of
interment
at
a
national
cemetery.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no.
mr.
nathan
lewin
oh,
no.
the
contempt
was
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
was
--
yes,
it
was
a
contempt
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
that
--
it
was
--
the
regulation
was
so
construed
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
have
one
copy
of
the
opinion.
mr.
nathan
lewin
thank
you.
thank
you
your
honor.
i
--
for
purposes
of
my
argument
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
skip
over
very
quickly
the
historical
inquiry
which
i
think
has
been
gone
into
at
length
yesterday
and
in
mr.
spritzer's
argument
in
the
shillitani
and
the
pappadio
cases
heard
by
this
court.
i
would
also
--
and
before
getting
to
the
question
of
contemporary
policy
justifications
between
criminal
contempt,
violations
of
court
orders,
and
violations
of
statutes,
i
would
like
to
make
it
clear
that
our
argument
in
this
case
as
it
was
in
shillitani
and
pappadio
is
directed
to
the
kind
of
contempt
which
turns
on
violation
of
a
court
order
not
as
you
suggested
yesterday
mr.
justice
fortas,
misbehavior
in
a
courtroom
or
misbehavior
by
court
officials.
we
think
that
the
policy
justification
for
treating
those
kind
of
contempt
summarily
are
entirely
different
from
the
policy
justifications
which
apply
to
disobedience
of
court
orders.
and
therefore
to
the
extent
that
we
make
the
policy
argument
in
this
case
and
in
shillitani
and
pappadio,
we're
really
directing
our
attention
to
the
third
subsection
of
section
401
of
18
u.s.c.
which
speaks
in
terms
of
disobedience
of
court
orders
and
decrees
and
not
of
the
kinds
of
conduct
which
may
be
necessity
would
have
to
be
dealt
with
by
a
judge
without
jury
and
quite
summarily.
this
case
concerns
the
violation
of
a
judicial
decree
enforcing
a
cease
and
desist
order
of
an
administrative
agency.
in
that
respect,
we
think
it
illustrates
quite
graphically
the
principal
differences
between
a
violation
of
a
statute
which
we
think
is
a
crime
in
the
constitutional
sense
and
the
violation
of
a
court
order
which
constitutes
a
contempt.
a
statute
imposes
a
legal
duty
on
the
world
at
large.
a
court
order
imposes
such
a
duty
on
particular
person,
in
this
case
the
corporation
and
of
course
its
officers
who
were
present
and
testified
at
the
commission
hearing
and
had
all
opportunities
there
to
participate
in
drafting
or
in
the
process
in
which
the
order
which
contained
the
legal
duty
to
which
they
subjected
was
being
determined.
now,
congress
delegated
to
the
federal
trade
commission
the
duty
of
enforcing
by
such
cease
and
desist
orders,
the
prohibition
in
section
5
against
unfair
methods
of
competition
in
commerce
and
unfair
or
deceptive
acts
or
practices.
these
kinds
of
orders
may
be
entered
under
the
statutory
scheme
only
after
there's
been
one
violation
by
the
party
subject
to
the
order.
now,
in
this
case,
the
federal
trade
commission
conducted
extensive
hearings
to
determine
that
question.
the
testimony
of
260
witnesses
covering
85
hundred
pages
of
transcript
was
taken
in
14
cities
and
on
the
basis
of
that
evidence,
the
commission
concluded
that
the
corporation
of
which
petitioner
was
the
dominant
head
had
engaged
in
the
course
of
business
dealings
in
the
servicing
and
sale
of
home
furnaces
which
operated
to
defraud
consumers
and
to
injure
competitors.
throughout
the
commission
proceedings,
the
corporation
was
represented
by
counsel.
they
had
the
opportunity
to
cross-examine
witness
and
to
present
evidence
and
it
also
had
the
opportunity
to
challenge
the
hearing
examiners'
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
the
terms
of
the
cease
and
desist
order.
the
commission
concluded
on
the
basis
of
this
extensive
examination
that
the
record
and
i
quote,
"not
only
substantially
but
copiously
supports
the
findings
of
the
initial
decision"
and
it
directed
the
entry
of
an
order
which
in
very
specific
terms
prohibited
the
corporation,
its
representatives,
its
employees
and
its
agents
from
engaging
in
eight
specific
enumerated
deceptive
practices
such
as
false
representations
that
the
salesman
or
government
inspectors
or
heating
engineers,
that
the
furnaces
manufactured
by
competitors
were
defective
or
dangerous,
and
various
coercive
sales
techniques
involving
the
dismantling
of
furnaces
often
against
the
will
of
the
owners
of
the
furnace.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
enforced
this
order
pendente
lite
and
on
reviewing
the
record,
it
then
sustained
the
commission's
findings.
now
this
case
involves
violation
of
the
pendente
lite
order
but
the
basic
constitutional
issue
which
is
whether
petitioner
was
required
by
article
iii
of
the
sixth
amendment
to
have
a
jury
trial
would
be
presented
if
this
were
a
violation
of
the
final
order
of
the
court
enforcing
the
agency's
--
the
agency
determination.
so
in
effect,
what
petitioner
is
contending
is
that
notwithstanding
all
of
these
preliminary
stages
at
which
the
specific
--
at
which
he
was
a
party
or
at
least
there
was
a
corporation
who
was
represented
before
the
commission,
on
which
he
had
the
opportunity
to
challenge
prior
to
--
in
effect
having
to
obey
the
order
if
this
were
for
example,
a
final
order
entered
after
the
court
had
reviewed
the
underlying
findings.
he
is
saying
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
to
determine
whether
the
violation
of
a
court
order
committed
which
was
entered
after
all
of
these
preliminary
proceedings
was
in
fact
committed.
now,
before
considering
this
question,
i'd
like
to
make
it
clear
that
the
proceeding
that
was
held
here
before
the
court
of
appeals,
the
criminal
contempt
proceeding
was
a
criminal
action
in
every
way
other
than
the
fact
that
there
was
no
grand
jury,
there
was
no
indictment
in
effect,
and
there
was
no
petty
jury,
but
in
every
other
way
it
was
of
plenary
criminal
proceedings.
the
court
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
court
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
stipulations
pertain
i
think
principally
to
the
corporation.
so
far
as
the
petitioner
who
is
the
only
party
present
before
the
court,
he
had
a
ten
day
evidentiary
trial,
three
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
sat
in
the
court
of
appeals
courtroom
and
took
testimony
by
live
witnesses
at
which
each
one
of
the
individual
petitioners,
each
one
of
the
individual
--
individuals
who
were
charged
with
contempt
was
present
in
court,
was
represented
by
counsel,
and
each
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
each
of
the
live
witnesses
who
testified
in
the
court.
mr.
nathan
lewin
some
did
--
some
of
them
did,
yes,
petitioner
did.
mr.
nathan
lewin
this
petitioner
definitely
did
take
the
stand
and
made
in
the
course
of
his
testimony
admissions
which
counsel
who
are
appointed
by
the
court
to
prosecute
this
case
used
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
counsel
prosecuting
the
case
were
attorneys
who
are
federal
trade
commission
attorneys,
but
they
did
not
act
in
that
capacity
in
this
case.
the
court
was
very
careful
to
appoint
them
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
court
and
not
on
behalf
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
the
federal
trade
commission
was
neither
nominally,
was
with
--
or
at
least
was
not
nominally,
a
party,
or
at
least
--
these
attorneys
did
represent
the
court
of
appeals'
interest
in
prosecuting
the
contempt.
so
the
question
is
whether
following
this
substantial
preliminary
proceeding
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
had
this
entirely
plenary
hearing,
there
was
a
constitutional
requirement
that
a
jury
be
empaneled
to
determine
a
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
have
been
a
very
limited
number
of
those
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
kind
of
cases
mr.
justice
fortas.
they
--
there
are
several
labor
board
cases
in
which
labor
boards
instituted
or
urged
the
court
to
institute
both
criminal
and
civil
contempt
and
on
--
in
some
very
few
instances,
i
think
maybe
two
courts
of
appeals
did
find
defendants
in
criminal
contempt.
by
and
large,
the
proceedings
before
the
court
have
not
usually
been
as
full
as
they
were
in
this
case.
principally,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
[inaudible]
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
the
only
agencies
we've
come,
i
have
tried
to
survey
as
many
cases
as
could
be
found,
and
the
only
cases
we
found
have
been
orders
of
the
labor
board
orders
or
the
federal
trade
commission
in
which
this
question
has
come
up.
i
think
those
orders
are
particularly
suitable,
if
you
will,
for
this
kind
of
a
proceeding
because
they
usually,
those
are
the
agencies
which
usually
have
cease
and
desist
orders
at
one
kind
or
another
and
as
i
was
intending
to
come
to
shortly,
that's
precisely
why
the
remedy
of
criminal
contempt
is
so
necessary
and
can't
be
substituted
by
civil
contempt
in
those
areas,
where
the
federal
trade
commission
or
the
national
labor
relations
board
for
example
enter
an
order
directing
an
employer
or
a
corporation
to
cease
a
particular
practice,
obviously
the
employer
or
the
corporation
can't
or
their
officers
can't
be
thrown
in
jail
until
they
cease.
they
can
only
be
proceeded
against
after
they'd
committed
the
violation
of
the
order.
so
that
unlike
orders
which
compel
an
affirmative
act,
or
orders
which
direct
the
payment
of
money
for
example
which
some
of
the
other
agencies
can
do
and
they
enter
those
kind
of
orders,
these
are
the
kinds
of
orders,
labor
board
and
federal
trade
commission
orders
are
the
kinds
of
orders
that
if
they
are
to
be
enforced,
can
only
be
enforced
after
the
violation
by
a
proceeding
which
will
deter
future
violations
by
that
very
respondent
and
by
others.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
but
this
--
the
usual
sanction,
the
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
minute
this
was
--
let's
say
the
president
of
a
corporation
in
this
instance,
if
he
were
imprisoned
until
this
practice
is
ceased
and
presumably
they'd
--
they
would
cease
or
at
least
they
would
cease
from
the
minute
he'd
been
imprisoned,
he
could
no
longer
go
out
and
violate
the
order
nor
could
he
take
the
affirmative
steps
not
needed
to
remedy
the
prior
practice.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i'm
submitting
that
proposition
as
a
general
matter.
i
agree
that
there
are
trade
commission
orders
that
could
be
proceeded
against
in
a
civil
contempt.
but
cease
and
desist
by
definition
means,
don't
do
it
and
unless
you've
done
it,
you
haven't
violated
it.
and
if
you
--
if
you're
imprisoned,
then
you
certainly
can't
take
the
steps
to
remedy
what's
been
done
in
the
past,
that
that's
necessary
nor
can
you
repeat
what
you
violated
in
the
past.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
where
it
began.
i
know
that
there
are
decisions
of
this
court
pertaining
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
we've
never
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i'm
afraid
we
never
have.
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
really
wouldn't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
the
origin
just
lies
in
the
fact
that
there
were
or
that
there
are
proceedings
which
are
clearly
retrospective
and
there
are
proceedings
which
are
coercive
or
prospective
and
at
some
stage
no
doubt,
a
judge
determined
that
that
--
that
the
way
to
draw
the
line
between
the
two
would
be
by
saying
those
that
were
retrospective
were
like
criminal
sanctions
for
prior
punishment.
although
we
submit
as
these
kind
of
cases
show
and
as
labor
board
cases
in
which
an
employer
for
example
is
instructed
not
to
discharge
employees
because
of
union
activity
in
the
future.
now
that
can
only
be
enforced
by
punishing
him
when
he
does.
you
can't
--
you
can't
imprison
him
until
he
does
it.
mr.
nathan
lewin
other
violations
of
administrative
orders?
mr.
nathan
lewin
rarely.
i
don't
know
of
any
--
of
other
violations
of
administrative
orders
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
wouldn't
know
of
any
and
i
--
this
maybe
the
first
jail
sentence
for
violation
of
an
administrative
order.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
the
limitation
in
--
let
me
just
briefly
go
to
the
limitation
in
the
barnett
dictum.
we
don't
think
that
to
the
extent
that
--
a
rule
requiring
criminal
contempt
proceedings
with
a
jury
and
the
danger
of
one
unsympathetic
juror
in
effect
nullifying
what
is
a
--
an
agency
order
and/or
after
these
substantial
proceedings
would
be
a
proper
--
a
proper
remedy.
if
in
effect
courts
were
limited
to
punishing
only
with
petty
offense
sanctions,
those
who
had
violated
administrative
orders,
if
they
chose
to
proceed
without
a
jury,
then
corporations
who
are
by
and
large
the
offenders
in
these
sort
of
cases,
certainly
would
not
be
suffering
any
serious
damage
at
all
by
being
found
in
contempt.
the
limitation
on
a
petty
offense
sanction
is
$500,
limitation
so
far
is
fine
is
concerned.
mr.
nathan
lewin
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
on
its
petition
which
indicates
--
succinctly
said,
"you
can
impose
sanctions
going
beyond
the
petty
offense
limitation
when
it's
the
only
effective
sanction
for
a
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
--
alright
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
its
order
has
not
been
vacated.
and
that
--
that
is
in
effect
the
only
effective
sanction
against
the
kind
of
corp
--
the
kind
of
business
entities
that
are
involved
in
--
generally,
i
think
by
and
large
in
trade
commission
proceedings
or
possibly
in
labor
board
proceedings.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
that
the
system
of
law
as
we
have
it
in
this
country
turns
to
a
very
large
extent
on
obedience
to
court
orders
after
they
--
there
has
been
a
full
adjudication.
in
other
words,
when
a
court
looks
at
a
particular
instance,
in
particular
circumstances
and
has
before
it,
a
defendant
who
will
be
subject
to
its
order
and
he
is
able
in
that
proceeding
to
present
whatever
mitigating
factors
he
has,
and
the
court
then
enters
an
order
directing
him
to
carry
out,
to
act
in
a
certain
way
or
not
to
act
in
a
certain
way
that
it
would
be
--
it
would
undermine
the
principle
that
those
orders
should
be
obeyed
if
they
could
be
submitted,
if
they
would
have
to
be
submitted,
or
its
vindication
would
have
to
be
submitted
to
a
jury
of
12
men
subsequent
to
the
event.
in
other
words,
we
think
that
we,
as
a
legislative
command,
which
speaks
at
large,
may
and
should
under
our
constitutional
protections,
be
submitted
to
a
jury
for
its
application
of
that
legislative
command
to
a
particular
set
of
facts.
the
same
is
not
true
when
a
full
proceeding
has
been
entered
and
the
court
has
--
full
proceeding
has
been
conducted
and
the
court
has
entered
an
order
directed
to
an
individual
party
who
has
had
the
full
opportunity
to
litigate
the
merits
and
the
extent
of
that
order
in
the
proceeding
before
the
court.
we
think
those
commands
must
--
must
be
obeyed
and
the
court
should
have
the
authority
to
act
as
this
court
said
in
gompers
and
bucks
stove
&
range
promptly
and
independently
to
make
sure
that
those
orders
are
obeyed.
and
that
we
think
is
a
difference
mr.
justice
harlan,
just
that
one
case
it's
properly
submitted.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
it's
necessary
we
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
(inaudible)
--
the
specificity
of
the
acts
we
think
point
the
up
the
fact
that
in
--
in
the
last
analysis,
court
orders
which
are
directed
to
particular
instances
must
under
our
rule
of
law
be
obeyed.
we
can't
tolerate
a
system
of
law
which
would
submit
possibly
to
a
jury
of
--
where
one
man
maybe
hostile
to
the
underlying
order
as
in
this
case,
let's
say
to
the
federal
trade
commission
act
towards
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
those
kind
of
questions
can't
after
a
full
litigation
be
submitted
to
a
jury
of
12
men
to
determine
whether
the
order
will
in
fact
be
vindicated.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
i
mean
--
well,
because
in
those
cases
we
submit,
once
the
legislative
deter
--
legislative
determination
is
made
that
it
would
be
more
desirable
to
submit
that
kind
of
vindication
to
a
jury,
then
we
think
that
that
is
perfectly
appropriate
that
be
done.
but
we
think
in
the
absence
of
congressional
legislation,
our
system
of
law
really
depends
in
the
long
run
on
court
orders
being
effectively
vindicated.
mr.
nathan
lewin
all,
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
would
hope
not.
i
--
you
mean
--
you
mean
a
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
you
mean
the
preliminary
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
this
--
i
think
this
order
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
the
order
the
federal
trade
commission
is
just
as
very
specifically
directed
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
on
pages
2
and
3
of
the
transcript
of
record
and
it
is
very
specifically
directed
mr.
justice
fortas
to
this
conduct
and
no
other.
there
is
no
statement,
catchall
clause
in
there
about
not
violating
section
5
or
anything.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
it
does.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
we
think
in
those
instances
mr.
justice
fortas,
it
would
be
a
very
perfectly
proper
and
appropriate
defense
that
the
--
the
alleged
contemnor
could
not
have
known
or
did
not
know
that
his
conduct
fell
within
the
vio
--
fell
within
the
confines
of
the
order.
if
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
that's
right.
our
position
is
that
it
--
that
it
--
that's
it
made
to
a
judge
and
that
whatever
this
court
determines
as
to
that
part
of
the
order
mr.
justice
fortas,
applies
as
well
to
the
very
specific
terms.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
specific
order
with
very
specific
terms
and
there
was
abundant
evidence
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
those
very
specific
terms
had
been
violated
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
nathan
lewin
by
cheff
himself,
that
he
had,
the
court
of
appeals'
found,
put
up
a
--
on
a
pretense
of
violate
--
of
complying
with
this
order
but
that
--
actually
his
instructions
to
subordinates
were
not
to
change
the
practices
or
not
to
change
the
prior
practices
and
that
he
allowed
them
to
continue
and
that
he
continued
to
profit
from
what
had
--
what
had
been
done
in
the
past.
mr.
nathan
lewin
he
denied
all
of
it.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
was
only
--
i
think
only
one
judge
who
was
common
or
--
there
was
only
--
only
judge
schnackenberg
i
think
was
--
both
signed
to
the
order
and
tried
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
the
proceeding.
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
pardon?
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
there
was
a
different
panel
at
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
except
for
judge
schnackenberg,
it
was
a
different
[inaudible]
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
the
only
way
it
could
be
consistent
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
as
that
letter
points
out
that
the
interment
regulations
incorporated
substantially
different
policy
for
purposes
of
what
--
how
they
would
define
crime,
then
the
sixth
amendment
or
article
iii
line
and
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
--
that
--
there's
no
doubt
in
our
mind
and
the
cases
of
this
court
have
made
clear
that
for
very
many
purposes,
criminal
contempt
is
a
crime.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we've
argued
that
it's
not
a
crime
for
purposes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
sixth
amendment
or
article
iii.
oh,
we
agree
that
it's
a
crime
for
purposes
of
the
burden
of
proof
and
the
court
found
that
in
this
case
that
--
let
them
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
for
purpose
of
the
statute
of
limitations
which
is
what
gompers
versus
united
states
involve
and
for
various
other
procedural
in
--
and
possibly
for
various
other
substantive
purposes.
the
real
--
the
question
now
is
whether
the
constitution
or
the
constitutional
draftsmen
in
using
the
word
crime
intended
to
incorporate
contempt
and
our
argument
in
these
cases
is
really
devoted
not
to
defining
crime
in
general,
but
just
to
the
fact
or
just
to
the
limited
proposition
or
purposes
of
article
iii
and
for
purposes
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
as
it
was
in
the
minds
of
a
constitutional
draftsmen,
contempt
was
sui
generis.
it
was
not
a
crime
and
it
was
a
civil
penalty,
it
was
contempt.
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
i
said
so
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
i'm
sorry,
i
must
have
misspoke
myself.
i
meant
that
it
was
a
crime
for
purposes
--
for
constitutional
purposes
and
for
purposes
of
article
iii,
and
for
purposes
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
not
--
as
this
court
has
recognized
and
i
say
in
a
whole
series
of
decisions
in
gompers,
in
cooke
versus
united
states
and
various
other
decisions
that
criminal
contempt
is
a
crime
and
we
don't
contest
that
at
all.
we
agree
that
criminal
contempt
is
a
crime
for
a
variety
of
purposes.
the
only
question
here
and
the
question
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
it's
a
crime
for
purposes
at
trial
by
jury
--
for
the
trial
by
jury
guarantee
and
certainly,
the
word
crime
can
mean
different
things
in
different
statutes
or
in
different
constitutional
provisions.
and
our
argument
limited
to
that
proposition
is
that
it's
not
a
crime
for
purposes
of
a
jury
trial
guarantee
and
that's
all
that
i
intend
to
argue
your
honors
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
may
i
--
right.
may
i
just
take
a
minute
to
--
i
know
mr.
casey
mentioned
something
about
a
letter
that
we
had
submitted
in
the
opinion
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
to
respond
to
them
mr.
chief
justice.
the
opinion
that
we
sent
out
to
the
court
was
the
federal
trade
commission
opinion
which
is
cited
on
the
first
page
of
our
brief,
is
an
opinion
below
which
officially
reported,
volume
55
of
the
federal
trade
commission
reports.
in
preparing
for
oral
argument,
i
discovered
that
it
was
no
place
in
the
very
truncated
record
that
the
--
this
transcript
of
record
that
the
court
had
here.
it's
of
course
an
official
document
in
the
federal
trade
commission
reports,
which
this
court
could
look
at
in
the
one
or
two
volumes
of
volume
55
of
the
federal
trade
commission
reports
it
has
in
its
library.
and
in
addition,
it
was
definitely
in
the
record
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
very
expressly
took
judicial
notice
of
that
opinion
that
this
court
could
do
and
was
certainly
not
sent
up
here
in
order
to
give
it
undue
emphasis
or
notoriety,
i
submit
that
it's
mr.
casey
who
has
done
that
simply
by
raising
the
issue.
