mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
inquire
of
the
solicitor
general
on
--
when
he
makes
his
argument
as
to
the
propriety
of
it,
mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lewin,
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lewin,
after
all
your
statement
that
the
--
this
is
not
a
crime,
you're
discussing
that
yesterday
with
mr.
lewin
in
relation
to
a
res
opinion
of
the
attorney
general's
office
and
i
thought
we
would
continue
the
discussion
today
perhaps,
but
the
government
has
waived
20
of
its
30
minutes
in
that
case
and
--
so
we
haven't
the
chance
to
do
that,
have
you
--
did
you
bring
that
opinion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
distribute
it
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
consistent
with
your
position
here
today?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
it
is
not
a
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
it
--
does
it
treat
it
as
a
crime
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
is
that
regulation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
did
add
the
three
years
for
the
substantive
offense
and
the
four
years
for
the
contempt
to
make
five
years
so
the
man's
remains
could
not
be
--
be
buried
in
arlington
cemetery,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
contempt
by
a
court-martial
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
within
that
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
was
--
it
was
a
clear
contempt
of
court
similar
to
those
that
we
had
in
shillitani
and
in
the
other
case
yesterday,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
did
use
--
and
they
did
use
that
contempt
in
the
sense
of
it
being
a
crime
in
order
to
deprive
this
man
that
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
you
have
the
opinion
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
see
--
may
i
see
the
one
copy?
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lewin,
i'm
just
speaking
of
the
opinion
which
you
handed
me
a
few
moments
ago.
i
notice
that
the
attorney
general
cites
a
relevant
part
of
the
regulation
he
is
interpreting
as
follows,
"a
person
otherwise
eligible
for
burial
in
a
national
cemetery
but
who
is
convicted
in
a
federal
court
of
a
crime
or
crimes
result
of
which
was
a
sentence
to
imprisonment
for
five
years
or
more
will
not
be
buried
in
a
national
cemetery."
then
he
says,
“in
my
judgment,
it
could
reasonably
be
concluded
that
thompson
was
within
the
meaning
of
that
regulation,
convicted
in
a
federal
--
in
a
federal
court
of
a
crime
or
crimes
the
result
of
which
was
a
sentence
to
imprisonment
for
five
years
or
more."
in
a
single
proceeding
before
a
federal
court,
he
was
convicted
both
of
violating
the
smith
act
and
a
criminal
contempt.
and
then
there
is
a
significant
footnote
at
that
point
in
which
he
says,
“your
interpretation
of
the
word
crime
as
used
in
the
regulation
as
including
criminal
contempt
punishable
under
18
u.s.c.
401
is
i
believe
fully
justify
criminal
contempt
is
regarded
as
a
crime.”
for
most
purposes,
and
citing
gompers
versus
united
states
and
another,
new
orleans
versus
steamship
company,
“and
no
reason
is
apparent,
why
for
purposes
of
the
interment
regulations
criminal
contempt
should
be
distinguished
from
any
other
infraction
of
law
punishable
by
imprisonment.
now,
is
that
at
all
consistent
with
what
you
are
arguing
here
in
these
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
argued
that
in
any
of
these
contempt
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
is
not
a
crime
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
in
your
opening
statement,
your
opening
--
first
sentence
that
criminal
contempt
is
not
a
crime.
and
the
--
i
understood
mr.
spritzer
to
say
that
it
has
been
so
contended
throughout
history
by
the
department
of
justice.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
seem
to
me
that
when
it's
considered
a
crime
to
pursue
a
man
after
his
death,
that
it
does
have
the
consequences
of
crime
in
the
same
way
as
any
other
felony
--
any
other
felony
does
and
that
the
distinction
is
well
made.
that's
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
right.
i
wish
you
would.
