mr.
w.
paul
flynn
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
answering
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
jewett
city,
is
about
50
miles
east
of
new
haven.
if
you've
ever
been
out
to
the
yale
harvard
crew
you'd
pass
through
--
mr.
w.
paul
flynn
--
well,
it's
on
the
turnpike.
you
would
get
off
at
the
griswold
exit,
mr.
justice
harlan,
and
you
drive
about
6
miles
north
along
that
quinebaug
river
and
you
would
come
to
the
aspinook
mill.
it
was
originally
a
gray
goods
mill
that
manufacturers
un-dyed
woolen
products.
it
is
the
largest
single
industrial
complex
in
the
community
and
when
anything
happened
at
aspinook
mill,
everybody
in
town
was
interested.
it
was
used
as
a
sugar
warehouse.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
testimony
in
this
trial
indicated
that
there
was
a
brooklyn
cooperage
company
that
was
a
sugar
warehousing
concern
right
next
door,
strangely
enough.
it
was
also
a
repository
for
lumber
supplies
for
a
company
operated
by
a
man
by
the
name
of
rumpler
who
was
a
co-owner
of
aspinook
mill
incorporated
of
the
griswold
corporation.
i'm
sure
that
my
worthy
adversary
has
never
been
near
a
still
in
his
life,
especially
where
there
has
been
mash
that
has
been
fermenting,
because
it
has
an
unmistakable
odor.
and
to
say
that
this
was
an
area
removed
and
remote
or
that
all
stills
are
located
in
areas
that
are
removed
and
remote
is
to
use
an
inductive
conclusion
as
the
major
premise
in
your
stilligism,
because
in
fact,
all
stills
are
not
out
in
the
country,
at
least
not
in
new
england.
as
a
prosecutor
myself,
i'd
prosecuted
them
whether
they
had
been
in
the
store,
right
in
downtown
bridgeport
and
they
had
a
400
gallon
capacity
and
there
were
people
living
upstairs
and
many
a
small
entrepreneur
in
the
new
england
area
has
his
little
piece
of
equipment
down
in
the
basement,
supposed
to
manufacture
his
own
personal
stock
and
he
is
regularly
arrested
and
prosecuted
for
it.
so,
i'm
sure
they
don't
hang
a
sign
out
in
front
of
the
house
saying
inside
being
operated
a
private
distillery.
i'm
sure
that
in
that
sense
they
are
secreted
and
secluded,
but
i
am
equally
sure
that
the
conclusion
reach
by
this
court
in
gainey
for
a
major
premise
that
they
are
always
secreted
and
secluded
is
an
inductive
major
premise
and
fallacious,
somewhat
akin
to
a
rationale
used
by
one
of
my
teachers
in
my
youth
all
irish
men
are
drunks,
flynn
is
an
irish
man,
that
conclusion
is
inevitable,
flynn
is
a
drunk.
all
stills
are
in
some
remote
and
removed
portion
of
the
geography
is
not
true,
it
is
not
factual.
in
fact,
the
department
of
justice
knows
or
should
know
that
there
are
countless
numbers
of
prosecutions
for
illicit
still
operations
where
the
entire
operation
is
conducted
within
the
confines
of
a
metropolitan
area.
mr.
w.
paul
flynn
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
w.
paul
flynn
i
would
think
that
--
i
would
think
so
mr.
justice
black.
i
would
think
that
they
would
have
been
before
this
court
for
other
reasons
on
a
number
of
occasions,
but
the
conclusion
in
gainey
is
that
they
are
always
removed
and
remote.
and
i
must
admit
that
i
coin
the
conclusions
reach
by
this
court
in
gainey
to
be
somewhat
fearsome
for
the
purposes
for
which
it
can
be
used,
not
the
purposes
for
which
it
will
be,
but
can
be
used.
would
it
be
improper
for
example,
for
a
prosecutor
at
the
conclusion
of
a
case
in
which
the
evidence
showed
that
a
man
arrived
at
the
front
door
to
a
building,
opened
the
building
and
ten
minutes
later,
he
was
being
searched
against
the
wall?
would
it
be
improper
if
this
man
had
a
criminal
record
two
pages
long
and
decided
to
exercise
his
rights
to
remain
silent?
would
it
be
improper
for
the
prosecutor
to
say
that
congress
of
the
united
states
has
said
that
if
you
find
a
man
on
the
premises
at
a
time
when
and
a
place
where
distilled
spirits
are
then
and
there
being
produced,
you
may
find
him
guilty
and
the
only
other
evidence
they
have
is
they
got
a
still
and
he
is
there
and
that
still
isn't
registered.
that
means
they
put
on
a
clerk
from
the
registry
office,
they
put
on
an
investigator
to
say
that
it
was
a
still
and
they
put
the
man
present.
mr.
w.
paul
flynn
i
would
think
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
trial
judge
would
use
what
i
understand
to
be
a
classical
description
of
proof
when
there
is
not
specific
evidence,
circumstantial
evidence.
the
cat
and
the
mouse,
example,
if
you
put
the
cat
with
a
mouse
in
a
steel
box
and
close
the
lid
on
it
and
lock
it
up
in
the
closet
and
come
back
an
hour
later
and
take
the
lid
off
of
the
box
and
there
is
only
a
very
smiling
looking
mouse
inside
you
may
presume
that
the
cat
ate
the
mouse.
i
would
think
that
type
of
charge
would
be
proper,
that's
calling
upon
the
personal
experience
of
the
jury.
that's
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
court
will
go
back
to
the
original
transcript
at
page
163,
judge
cleary
said,
at
that
time
when
there
was
colloquial
between
counsel,
“isn't
it
true
with
respect
to
ottiano
that
all
the
government
has
to
do
is
put
him
in
the
building
at
a
time
when
and
a
place
where
there
is
a
still
that's
not
registered?”
mr.
w.
paul
flynn
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
w.
paul
flynn
oh!
no,
not
mr.
ottiano,
sir.
mr.
frank
romano
indicated
that
he
had
been
there
three
days.
the
evidence
was
that
john
ottiano
had
arrived
at
the
still
premises,
that's
the
43-acre
tract
at
7:30
in
the
morning.
at
7:40
in
the
morning
they
had
him
against
the
wall
inside
the
still.
mr.
w.
paul
flynn
yes
sir
and
the
evidence
is
unmistakable
in
this
case
that
the
gate
was
open.
mr.
w.
paul
flynn
yes
sir,
but
that
doesn't
give
any
possession
mr.
justice
clark.
if
i
can
drive
into
the
parking
lot
of
the
supreme
court
building
underground
here,
if
it
takes
a
key
to
get
in
someone
might
construe
me
to
be
in
possession
if
that
was
the
evidence
and
i
was
there,
they
might.
although
i
think
that
is
not
a
rational
connection,
but
how
about
if
the
door
is
open
and
anybody
can
go
in
and
there
are
three
other
businesses
being
conducted
on
the
premises.
the
fact
that
a
man
has
a
key
that
will
open
the
lock
doesn't
put
him
in
possession
of
a
still.
and
if
he's
only
been
in
the
room
for
ten
minutes,
if
he's
only
been
in
the
building
for
ten
minutes,
it
seems
to
me
irrational
to
say
that
he
now
has
custody,
possession
and
control
as
this
court
said
in
the
bozza
case,
when
they
said
that
it
means
you
have
to
have
a
watchmen
or
a
caretaker.
the
only
evidence
of
a
caretaker
in
this
case
was
mr.
lockwood,
witness
for
the
government.
he
indicated
that
he
had
been
through
all
over
these
premises
at
or
about
the
time
when
this
crime
was
supposed
to
have
been
committed.
mr.
w.
paul
flynn
yes
sir.
if
the
gainey
case
is
correct
in
that
you
may
from
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
and
the
intent
of
congress,
they
couldn't
get
a
conviction
in
any
other
way,
so
they
need
a
presumption.
if
gainey
is
incorrect,
then
you
would
have
to
go
i
think
to
the
specific
charge
in
this
case
and
see
whether
or
not
this
court
used
language
that
is
fairly
comparable
to
the
language
used
by
the
trial
judge
in
the
middle
district
of
georgia
in
gainey
and
i
can't
find
it
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
have
read
that
charge
30
or
40
times.
i
know
that
he
charged
the
jury
as
every
trial
judge
does,
what
a
reasonable
doubt
is
and
i
know
that
he
said
that
you
are
the
finders
of
fact,
and
i
also
know
that
he
said,
that
there
is
a
presumption,
you
can
convict
on
the
basis
of
that
presumption.
he
followed
that
with
an
aider
and
abettor
charge
and
he
followed
the
aider
and
abettor
charge
with
a
charge
on
conspiracy,
so
it
was
from
tinkers
to
evers
to
into
the
pot,
everything
was
cooked
and
the
jury
at
that
stage
i
am
convinced
could
have
been
infected
by
the
presumption
charge.
and
in
effect,
what
the
court
is
saying
in
this
case
is
ottiano
and
romano
and
in
fact
vellucci,
they
didn't
testify
and
you
may
find
them
guilty,
if
you
find
that
they
were
present,
but
doesn't
the
trial
judge
have
to
reach
a
finding
of
fact
first?
doesn't
he
have
to
find
that
each
of
these
accused
were
present
in
order
to
make
the
charge,
because
in
the
language
of
gainey,
he
is
not
required
to
make
the
charge,
i
assume,
if
he
doesn't
make
that
finding
of
fact,
but
if
he
makes
a
finding
of
fact,
what
do
we
have
the
12
people
in
the
box
for.
the
jury
served
no
useful
purpose
or
they
were
led
to
a
conclusion
by
what
i
contend
to
be
an
erroneous
charge,
that
violates
the
constitutional
protections
of
each
of
these
accused.
and
in
the
language
of
the
granting
a
certiorari
in
this
case,
i
think
the
infection
reached
every
defendant
in
the
courtroom,
that
went
to
the
jury,
but
that
wasn't
every
defendant
in
this
case,
one
of
them
was
discharged
at
the
end
of
the
prosecutions
case
and
one
of
them
withdrew
his
plea
of
not
guilty
in
the
--
after
about
two
or
three
days
of
trial
and
changed
this
plea
to
a
lesser
offense.
i
must
tell
you
gentlemen.
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
w.
paul
flynn
no
sir,
i
do
not,
because
if
they
were
intended
to
do
that
they
would
have
changed
the
language
in
the
possession
statute
from
that
which
was
before
this
court
in
bozza
and
they
didn't
change
the
language
one
bit,
all
they
did
is
add
a
presumption.
mr.
w.
paul
flynn
i
think
that
there
is
evidence
or
some
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
and
the
department
of
justice
in
preferring
and
internal
revenue
service
in
preferring
this
legislation.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
evidence
says
that
we
can't
convict
them
any
other
way
gentlemen,
give
us
a
presumption,
because
if
they
intended
in
some
way
to
enlarge
this
--
i
would
say
in
1958
elect
to
enact
11
different
ways
in
which
the
statute
can
be
violated.
there
are
11
different
offenses
under
5601(a).
each
one
of
them
is
separate
and
distinct
crime
and
for
anyone
operating
a
still,
i
would
think
under
this
presumption
it
would
be
possible
to
convict
him
of
four
offenses.
he
didn't
give
a
bond,
he
didn't
register,
he
is
producing
distilled
spirits
and
he
is
in
possession,
that
means
in
effect
he
can
face
$40,000
worth
of
fines
and
20
years
in
prison.
in
theory,
i
think
this
court
might
accept
certiorari
if
that
happened,
but
in
theory,
they
have
made
a
separate
and
distinct
offense,
they
have
not
changed
the
descriptive
language
of
the
crime
from
bozza.
all
they
have
done
is
add,
they
said,
well
--
the
department
of
justice
says,
well
we
can't
get
a
conviction
under
bozza,
then
we
think
that
the
defendant
ought
to
explain
what
he
is
doing
there
and
if
he
doesn't
that
he
can
be
convicted
of
the
crime
of
possession.
mr.
w.
paul
flynn
i
would
say
that
if
they
are
attempting,
if
it
is
the
conclusion
of
this
court
that
they
are
attempting
to
determine
what
constitutes
the
elements
of
the
crime
that
they
are
constitutionally
permitted
to
do
that.
if
they
are
attempting
to
determine
what
constitutes
sufficient
constitutional
proof
of
those
evidence
--
of
that
evidence,
they
are
not
permitted.
only
this
court
or
only
the
judiciary
is
permitted
to
do
that.
i
respectfully
submit
that
congress
can't
say
that
the
fact
that
i
have
a
dollar
bill
in
my
pocket
will
convict
me
of
counterfeiting
if
i
don't
know
that
it's
a
counterfeit
dollar
bill
and
i
got
it
as
change
downstairs
in
a
cafeteria.
if
congress
attempts
to
do
that,
that's
an
unconstitutional
exercise
of
their
legislative
prerogative
in
my
judgment.
mr.
w.
paul
flynn
well,
that's
the
language
that
judge
cleary
has
used.
he
did
not
use
burden
of
proof,
i
beg
your
pardon.
he
used
the
language,
the
burden
of
persuasion
shifts,
once
they
show
he
is
there,
not
the
burden
of
proof,
the
burden
of
going
forward
rests
--
mr.
w.
paul
flynn
well
your
honor,
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
determination
that
a
criminal
defendant
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
has
a
burden
of
ever
going
forward
if
he
wishes
to
exercise
his
prerogative
of
silence
that's
a
new
position.
i
have
never
heard
this
court
reach
that
conclusion
before.
a
man
does
exercise
a
risk
if
you
find
him
with
a
smoking
gun,
somebody
breaks
into
the
room
right
after
a
loud
rapport
and
there
is
a
dead
body
on
the
ground
and
he
is
yelling
“i
killed
him,
i
killed
him”
that
is
a
pretty
good
inference
that
he
killed
him,
but
not,
i
contend,
not
sufficient
inference
so
that
you
can
compel
him
to
take
the
witness
stand
and
if
doesn't
do
so,
he
does
it
at
his
peril,
that's
what
these
statutes
do.
they
compel
a
man
to
take
the
witness
stand
regardless
of
what
ancillary
peril
he
maybe
faced
with
and
in
the
process
he
may
very
well
prove
“i
wasn't
in
possession
of
this
place,
but
i
was
at
a
place
and
at
a
time
when
they
were
selling
some
of
the
entrepreneur's
product
and
that
probably
convicts
him
of
some
other
subsection
of
5601(a).
so
when
in
exculpating
himself
from
5601(a)(8)
which
is
the
production
statute,
he
probably
convicts
himself
of
some
other
subsection
of
5601.
i
contend
gentlemen
that
the
force
of
the
gainey
decision
if
applied
and
i
am
frank
to
admit
that
i
don't
understand
that
the
gainey
decision
tells
the
trial
judge
that
he
doesn't
have
to
charge
under
this
statute,
i
think
every
prosecutor
in
this
country
is
going
to
be
in
with
a
request
a
charge.
it
is
going
to
quote
the
language
of
the
statute
and
is
going
to
say
that
statute
has
been
sustained
by
united
states
and
gainey
and
the
judge
is
going
to
charge
on
it.
he
is
going
to
read
and
if
he
doesn't,
the
prosecutor
is
going
to
say
well,
the
united
states
and
gainey
for
example
has
been
sustained,
if
united
states
and
romano
were
sustained,
they
are
going
to
have
two
more
that
they
can
use
and
the
prosecutor
is
going
to
stand
up
and
say
that
congress
of
the
united
states
in
its
legislative
wisdom
has
determined
that
you
may
find
this
defendant
guilty
if
you
find
him
on
the
premises,
if
you
find
as
a
fact
that
he
was
on
the
premises
at
a
time
when
and
at
a
place
where
distilled
spirits
were
then
and
there
being
produced.
and
if
i
understand
the
wilson
case
from
1892,
such
a
comment
in
any
other
criminal
prosecution
would
be
error,
manifest
error,
but
apparently
for
moonshiners
that's
not
so.
i
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
no
matter
how
the
gainey
decision
is
read,
when
it
is
applied
to
the
facts
in
the
romano
case,
its
major
premise
fails
in
that
romano
case
did
not
involve
a
still
out
in
the
country
side
surrounded
by
trees
and
foliage,
it
wasn't
the
biggest
plant
in
town
with
three
other
companies
at
least
doing
business
on
the
premises.
and
insofar
as
keeping
the
public
away,
i
can
respectfully
suggest
that
the
public
was
never
kept
away
from
the
premises,
because
one
afternoon
i
drove
out
and
took
a
look
at
the
place
and
i
--
the
place
was
wide
open.
it
apparently
is
wide
open
six
days
a
week.
from
the
testimony
in
this
case,
i
respectfully
submit
that
there
is
error,
that
this
court
ought
to
reverse
the
findings.
