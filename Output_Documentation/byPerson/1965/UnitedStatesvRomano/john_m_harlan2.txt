case
within
the
four
corners
of
gainey,
because
up
to
now
you
have
been
saying
that
gainey
is
wrong
i
think,
i
guess
i
misunderstood
you?
justice
john

harlan
i
want
to
ask
you
one
question,
perhaps
you
are
coming
to
it,
do
you
agree
with
the
government,
that
the
effect
of
the
1958
enactment
of
the
presumption
was
to
increase
the
scope
of
the
crime
and
possession?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
legislative
history
that
indicates
they
wanted
to
overrule
bozza?
