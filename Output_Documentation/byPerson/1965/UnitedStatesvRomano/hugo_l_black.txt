justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
said
that
whenever
any
presence
is
found
at
the
scene
of
a
murder,
the
man
has
been
killed
recently,
the
jury
is
charged
to
assume
he
didn't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
at
present
he
is
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
that
it
probably
has
a
right,
but
it
does
not
have
a
right
to
search
that
the
jury
should
find
the
man
guilty,
by
certain
evidence,
[inaudible]
legislature
does
have
the
right
to
do
so
that
the
court
must
permit
the
jury
to
find
the
man
guilty,
if
they
find
the
his
presence,
presence
by
the
still's
operation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
you
don't
say
they
must
do
it,
but
they
must,
that
must
be
enough
to
permit
them
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
the
jury
and
court
make
it
should
be
enough?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we've
had
many
cases
here
on
that,
haven't
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
it,
we've
had
a
number
of
cases
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
said
he'd
been
there
three
days.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
even
had
the
keys
in
his
trousers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
position
as
i
understand
it,
congress
can
overrule
bozza
insofar
as
it
held
what
was
sufficient
evidence
on
which
a
court
would
permit
a
conviction,
a
case
to
go
to
jury.
do
you
think
they
can
constitutionally
overrule
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
maybe
suggested
that
they
could
change
the
burden
of
proof,
put
the
burden
on
the
defendant,
show
that
he
is
not
guilty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
the
legalistic
method
of
getting
around
the
question
that
whether
he
should
be
convicted,
before
he
can
be
convicted,
it
has
to
be
proved
satisfactory
to
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
without
any
legislative
buttressing
of
it
by
its
decision
to
what's
enough?
