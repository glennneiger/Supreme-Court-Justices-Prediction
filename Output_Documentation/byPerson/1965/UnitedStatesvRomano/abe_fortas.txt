if
a
truck
driver
were
delivering
supplies
to
the
still
and
was
found
there,
would
the
presumption
and
the
possession
apply
to
him?
justice
abe
fortas
the
still
would
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
statute
makes
that
distinction
between
inside
and
outside
of
the
still?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
somebody
came
to
the
still
to
pick
up
some
of
the
beverage
i
think
it's
that's
produced
there,
would
the
presumption
apply
to
him
and
would
he
therefore
be
presumed
that
he
was
engaged
in
the
crime
or
possession
on
the
still?
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps
that
is
rather
unusual
use
of
the
word
possession?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
protrude
this,
but
as
i
understood
you
a
moment
ago,
you
said
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
various
crimes
clustering
around
this
offense.
would
it
therefore
be
incorrect
for
me
to
assume
that
you
are
intending
to
tell
us,
that
in
your
mind
there
is
a
difference
between
possession,
the
crime
of
possession
and
the
crime
of
carrying
on
the
business?
