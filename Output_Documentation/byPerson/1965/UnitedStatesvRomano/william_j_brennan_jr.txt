justice

j.
brennan,

well,
what
would
that
leave
for
us
to
decide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

only
the
possession.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
presumption.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
in
the
way
of
what's
required
of
the
government
to
prove
in
addition
to
presence
at
the
crime
of
possession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
and
became
carrying
on
production
and
possession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
there
is,
what
i'm
asking
is,
the
presumptions
permit
inferences
based
on
their
presence,
do
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
any
of
those
circumstances,
he
might
be
where
the
still
is
actually
operating,
his
mere
presence
might
support
where
it's
operating,
and
the
government's
proof
is
that
it
was
operating,
convictions
on
counts
for
all
three
when
all
the
reason
in
the
way
of
proof
is
he
was
there,
nearby,
and
that
the
still
was
operating?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
there
for
three
counts,
there
could
be
convictions
of
all
three?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
that
much
proof
and
no
more?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
it
might
depend
exactly
where
on
the
site
or
how
near
the
site
the
accused
was,
whether
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
possession
as
against
carrying
on
or
as
against
production,
did
you
make
a
distinction
on
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
would
apply
to
all
three
presumptions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
i
didn't
understand
you
to
make
a
distinction
between
his
location
as
determining
whether
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
possession
as
against
production
as
against
carrying
out?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
and
that
is
certainly
--
where
there
is
evidence,
which
might
support
an
inference,
if
the
trial
judge
obliges
to
submit
the
question
of
guilt
from
presence
in
the
government's
view,
perhaps
not
in
gainey,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
to
apply
that
same
rule
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
the
judge's
discretion
to
all
of
these
offenses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
on
gainey
not
even
required
to
submit
to
the
jury
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
â€“-
