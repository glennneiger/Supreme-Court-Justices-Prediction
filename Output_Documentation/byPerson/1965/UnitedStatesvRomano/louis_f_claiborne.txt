mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
moonshine
case.
it's
the
second
installment,
really
a
sort
of
stepchild
of
the
gainey
case
decided
last
term.
here
as
in
that
case,
the
issue
is
whether
certain
so
called
statutory
presumptions,
which
were
added
to
the
alcohol
tax
chapter
of
the
internal
revenue
code
in
1958,
are
sufficiently
rational
to
satisfy
the
test
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
statutes
involved
here
are
printed
at
the
front
of
our
brief
and
of
course,
i
will
come
to
them
later.
i
should
like
first
to
say
something
briefly
about
the
facts
of
the
case.
the
moonshine
operation
here,
unlike
gainey,
was
in
an
otherwise
vacant
dilapidated
warehouse
building,
part
of
a
large
industrial
complex,
on
the
edge
of
jewett
city,
connecticut.
the
complex
itself
comprising
some
42
acres
was
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
a
fence,
on
the
other
side
by
a
river.
at
the
time
of
the
raid,
which
led
to
this
case,
the
building
was
locked,
most
of
the
windows
were
obscured.
the
agents
who
had
obtained
a
warrant
had
to
force
their
way
in
breaking
the
lock.
the
agents
found
inside,
what
i'm
told
is
a
large
illicit
still
operation,
one
that
could
produce
almost
400
gallons
of
whiskey
a
day.
there
were
also
other
evidence
of
the
operation,
including
quantities
of
the
distilled
spirits
and
bags
of
sugar
on
the
premises.
the
two
petitioners
before
the
court
now
were
found
a
few
feet
from
the
still.
one
of
them
said
he
had
been
three
for
three
days
that
the
still
had
been
going
all
that
time.
the
still
was
in
full
operation
at
the
time.
on
the
person
of
the
other
petitioner
were
found
keys
to
the
building
and
to
the
gate
and
the
fence,
which
surrounded
the
complex.
together
with
two
others,
the
petitioners
were
brought
to
trial
before
a
jury,
and
all
those
whose
cases
went
to
the
jury
were
convicted
on
all
charges
against
them.
all
four,
the
two
petitioners
and
two
others,
were
convicted
for
conspiring
to
illegally
produce
distilled
spirits
and
also
for
the
substantive
offense
of
producing
spirits
without
a
license.
the
petitioners
and
the
petitioners
alone
were
additionally
charged
and
convicted
with
illegally
possessing
a
unregistered
still.
the
petitioners
were
sentenced
to
concurrent
jail
sentences
on
all
three
counts,
conspiracy
to
produce,
production
and
possession,
but
in
addition
a
fine
was
imposed
as
to
each
of
the
petitioners
on
the
possession
count.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
must
have
mislead
your
honor.
as
to
the
--
what
we
may
call
a
fed
count,
the
possession
count,
that
question
is
necessarily
before
the
court
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
–
because
there
was
an
additional
fine
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
–
but
as
to
the
second
count,
production
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
that
concurrent
with
the
conspiracy
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now
as
i
will
explain,
the
conspiracy
convictions
were
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit,
a
petition
from
those
affirmances
was
taken
here
and
denied.
therefore,
those
convictions
are
final,
the
three-year
and
two-year
sentences
imposed,
one
as
to
ramona
the
other
as
to
ottiano
on
that
count,
the
conspiracy
count
fully
supports
the
sentence,
identical
concurrent
sentence
on
the
second
count,
which
is
produced.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
on
the
other
the
court
of
appeals,
perhaps
unnecessarily,
did
reach
the
conviction
on
the
second
count
and
did
hold
unconstitutional
the
presumption
involved
in
the
second
count
applicable
to
the
crime
of
production.
for
that
reason,
we
argue
it,
though
we
recognize
that
is
not
necessarily
before
this
court,
that
the
court
is
free
to
do
as
it
did
in
gainey
and
simply
to
reverse
on
the
ground
that
the
court
below
need
not
have
reached
the
question
and
without
this
court
itself
reaching
the
question,
that
is
what
the
court
did
in
gainey
with
respect
to
the
possession
count.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
only
the
possession
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
possession,
presumption.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now
i
may
say
even
as
to
that,
that
the
court
below
it
had
no
occasion
to
reach
it
under
its
holding,
might
have
avoided
even
a
decision
there
had
it
thought
the
cumulative
sentences
were
improper
in
the
circumstances,
thus
eliminating
the
fine
of
the
third
count
and
leaving
only
sentences
concurrent
with
the
one
count,
which
is
finally
affirmed
and
not
open
here.
in
our
view,
very
large
in
the
background
of
this
case,
in
controlling
it
in
many
respects,
perhaps
in
most
respects,
is
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
gainey.
as
the
court
would
remember,
in
gainey,
you
sustained
the
rationality
and
therefore
the
constitutionality
of
a
statutory
provision,
a
so
called
statutory
presumption
that
authorized
the
jury
to
convict
the
person
found
at
the
site
of
a
still
whose
presence
was
not
satisfactorily
explained
by
the
evidence
of
illegally
carrying
on
the
business
of
a
distiller.
the
court
so
concluded
in
light
of
two
considerations,
first
the
breadth
of
that
substantive
offense
carrying
on
the
business
of
a
distiller,
which
the
court
concluded
included
as
principles
that
are
under
the
aider
and
abettor
statute,
all
persons
connected
in
a
business
way
with
the
illegal
operation,
that
is
the
owner,
the
operator,
his
helpers,
his
suppliers,
his
distributors.
the
second
consideration
was
the
unlikelihood
that
anyone
other
than
those
mentioned
would
be
found
at
the
still
in
light
of
the
isolated
location
of
such
stills,
the
traditional
secrecy
of
moonshine
operation
and
the
policy
of
deterring
a
way
of
discouraging
any
stray
person
who
might
wander
on
to
the
premises.
it
may
be
important
to
note
preliminarily,
a
possible
distinction
between
gainey
and
this
case
in
that
here,
we
have
a
city
still
whereas
in
gainey
we
had
a
country
still.
we
think
the
distinction
is
unimportant
and
i
must
say
that
counsel
for
respondents
does
not
make
anything
of
it,
but
on
its
face
one
might
suppose
that
here
there
was
no
isolation
in
the
same
sense
as
in
gainey
and
that
ingredient
of
the
court's
decision
was
lacking
here.
however,
in
a
different
sense,
there
is
equal
inaccessibility
to
the
still
site
here
in
the
city
as
there
in
the
country.
it's
not
attributable
to
same
factors.
we
couldn't
describe
the
premises
here
as
an
arcane
spot,
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
chances
that
an
outsider
would
accidentally
penetrate
the
compound
is
perhaps
even
less
than
in
gainey.
i
need
only
to
remind
to
the
court
that
the
building
housing
the
still
was
firmly
locked,
but
to
approach
it
a
curiosity
seeker
would
have
to
penetrate
a
normally
locked
fence
surrounding
the
entire
complex,
guarded
by
a
watchman
and
it's
certainly
no
one
was
likely
to
stumble
on
to
this
building
most
uninviting
and
dilapidated
as
it
was
by
accident.
now
my
opponent
seems
to
suggest
a
reconsideration
of
gainey
recognizing
its
force
in
our
case.
i
assume
that,
that
decision
rendered
only
last
term
is
too
recent
to
warrant
by
supposing
that
the
court
would
want
to
hear
a
re-argument
today.
accordingly,
i
confine
myself
to
building
on
gainey
without
repeating
the
arguments
made
at
that
time
to
sustain
it.
the
issue
here
as
i
said
is
the
constitutionality
of
two
statutory
presumptions
quite
comparable
to
that
sustained
in
gainey.
here,
they
involve
presumptions
applicable
to
the
crime
of
possessing
a
still
and
to
the
crime
of
producing
distilled
spirits
without
a
license.
whereas
in
gainey,
the
offense
and
the
presumption
applicable
to
it
was
carrying
on
the
business
of
the
distiller
without
a
bond.
in
light
of
the
gainey
ruling,
the
only
real
question
here
is
whether
these
offenses,
like
the
offense
of
carrying
on
the
business
involved
in
gainey
is
also
all
comprehensive,
so
as
to
include
everyone
likely
to
be
found
at
the
site
of
the
still.
if
so,
then
the
inference
which
the
statute
permits
from
presence
at
the
site
is
rational
and
constitutional
as
it
was
in
gainey.
if
the
substantive
offenses
here
on
the
contrary
are
much
narrower,
then
we
cannot
sustain
the
rationality
of
the
statutory
presumption.
before
discussing
each
of
the
substantive
offenses
here
and
their
relative
broadness,
it
may
be
important
to
say
and
to
emphasize
that
the
three
crimes
involved,
the
two
here
and
the
one
in
gainey
are
not
wholly
overlapping.
if
they
were,
that
would
tend
to
make
nonsense
out
of
the
congressional
scheme.
it
would
be
difficult
to
understand
why
congress
had
written
three
provisions
which
in
all
circumstances
covered
the
identical
conduct
by
the
same
people.
moreover
if
that
was
the
fact,
we
would
confront
problems
of
election
and
accumulation
of
sentences.
they
are
important
differences
between
the
three
crimes,
albeit
we
say
they
are
all
three
broad
crimes.
the
offense
of
possession
of
an
unregistered
still
unlike
the
other
two
production
and
carrying
on
the
business
even
expanded
as
we
said
was
in
1958,
probably
encompasses
only
persons
physically
connected
with
the
skill
--
with
the
distill,
whose
proximity
to
the
still
is
immediate.
that
is
clearly
not
true
of
the
offense
of
carrying
on
the
business
nor
is
it
true
of
the
crime
production.
here
the
two
the
co-defendants
who
were
not
found
at
the
still
were
convicted
of
producing.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
and
the
situation
involved
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
proof
is
the
same
in
this
respect.
there
are
other
differences
which
i'll
point
to.
the
actual
different
element
required
to
be
proved
here
is
in
the
case
of
possession,
the
failure
to
register
the
still,
in
the
case
of
carrying
on
the
business,
the
failure
to
post
a
bond,
quite
separate
requirement.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
that
presence,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
not
identical
in
all
three
cases.
the
presumptions
do
preserve
the
distinctions
in
this
respect
also.
the
presumption
with
respect
to
possession
applies
from
the
time
the
still
is
set
up,
that
is
from
the
time
when
it
is
essentially
operable
and
continues
until
the
still
is
taken
down,
the
presumption
and
so
does
the
crime
of
possession
stretch
for
that
long
time
span.
by
contrast,
the
crime
of
carrying
on
the
business
and
the
presumption
applicable
to
it,
comes
into
play
only
after
operations
have
begun,
not
merely
when
the
still
has
been
set
up
and
cease
once
the
business
has
ended,
even
though
the
still
may
remain
on
that
site.
the
crime
of
production
and
the
presumption
applicable
to
it
come
into
play
only
during
those
intermittent
periods
when
the
still
is
actually
operating.
though
the
intervals
within
the
larger
span
in
which
the
business
is
carried
on,
the
still
has
periods
of
rest
between
runs.
during
those
periods,
if
one
is
found
at
the
the
still,
he
is
not
presumed
guilty
of
production.
he
may
be
presumed
guilty
of
carrying
on
the
business
and
of
possession.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
true
that
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
your
honor.
he
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
some
cases
as
in
this
case
when
the
still
is
actually
in
full
blown
operation,
the
elements
of
all
the
presumptions
are
satisfied,
except
as
i
mentioned
the
additional
ingredient
which
must
be
proved
even
over
and
above
the
presence
which
is
failure
to
register
or
failure
to
obtain
a
bond
or
in
the
cases
of
production
failure
to
obtain
an
operating
permit.
those
respects
quite
similar
to
the
distinction
between
selling
narcotics
from
an
unstamped
package
and
selling
narcotics
without
a
prescribed
form.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
your
honor,
if
he
was
found
on
the
inside,
next
to
the
still,
the
presumption
would
apply
to
him.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it
would
have
to,
so
as
to
justify
the
inference
that
anyone
found
there
is
likely
to
be
guilty
of
the
substantive
presence.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
says
at
the
site
of
the
still.
normally,
this
refers
to
a
country
still
and
the
clearing
where
the
still
is
located
and
proximity
is
perhaps
--
less
easily
judged.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
would
say
so
your
honor.
we
view
the
crime
of
possession
as
equally
broad
as
the
crime
of
carrying
on
the
business
was
held
last
term
in
gainey
and
through
aider
and
abettor
statute,
if
not
directly,
as
encompassing
all
of
those
who
contribute
in
the
one
case
to
the
business
and
in
the
other
case
to
the
possession,
though
we
concede
that
as
to
possession
there
must
be
that
physical
proximity
which
is
not
a
necessary
ingredient
to
carrying
on
the
business.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
concede
that
that
is
so
your
honor
though
preserving
the
element
of
physical
proximity
it
seems
to
us
does
limit
the
amount
of
strain
we
impose
on
the
word.
we
reach
that
result
on
the
ground
that,
when
in
1958
the
congress
amended
the
alcohol
tax
law,
they
inserted
with
reference
to
the
crime
of
possession
an
inference,
that
anyone
found
at
a
setup
still
could
be
convicted
of
possession.
we
view
that
as
perhaps
an
awkward
way,
but
nevertheless
a
clear
way
of
broadening
the
offense
of
possession
and
saying
in
other
words,
anyone
found
at
the
still
shall
be
deemed
to
be
a
possessor
thereafter.
that
is
brought
out
rather
clearly
by
the
legislative
history,
which
shows
an
intent
to
overrule
the
bozza
case,
which
on
the
contrary
it
helped
possession
to
be
a
very
narrow
crime.
the
only
effective
way
of
resolving
the
problem
created
by
the
bozza
case
was
a
good
deal
to
enlarge
the
substantive
offense.
to
attribute
any
rationality
to
what
congress
was
doing,
we
must
assume
that
it
did
not
create
an
impossible
inference,
but
through
that
device
enlarged
the
substantive
offense
itself
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
your
honor,
i
say
there
is
a
difference
in
terms
of
the
time
span
covered
by
the
two
offenses,
in
terms
of
the
proximity
to
the
skill,
to
this
still
involved
and
in
terms
of
the
purpose
of
the
two
statutes.
i
should
emphasize
that
these
three
statutes,
albeit
they
overlap
in
many
respects
were
plainly
designed
to
enforce
three
separate
requirements
of
the
alcohol
tax
law.
they
serve
to
implement
on
the
one
hand
the
requirement
that
a
still
be
registered,
which
is
the
first
step.
secondly,
the
additional
requirement
that
a
distiller
post
a
bond
to
assure
that
the
taxes
due
will
be
paid.
and
finally,
with
reference
to
production,
the
requirement,
that
before
operations
begin,
an
operating
permit
be
obtained.
these
remarkably
stringent
requirements
aimed
at
eliminating
a
traffic,
which
has
been
known
in
this
country
and
dealt
with
by
the
congress
since
the
first
law
on
the
subject
in
1791
shows
a
perhaps
very
detailed
and
very
determined
effort
to
deal
at
every
conceivable
step
with
the
illicit
moonshining,
which
nevertheless
continues.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
was
only
suggesting
an
answer
to
a
question,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
a
person
found
on
the
outside
of
the
building
in
our
case
might
not
be
viewed
as
sufficiently
close
to
the
still
to
be
in
possession
of
it
or
for
that
matter
for
any
of
these
presumptions
to
come
into
play,
all
of
which
depend
upon
presence
at
the
site
of
the
still.
i
would
think
that
with
reference
to
an
enclosed
building,
the
site
is
inside
and
not
on
the
outside.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
applies
to
all
three
presumptions.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
with
reference
to
a
person
there,
no
sir,
but
with
reference
to
a
person
not
there,
he
couldn't
be
prosecuted
for
possession
i
say,
whereas
he
could
be
prosecuted
without
benefit
of
the
presumption
for
the
other
two
crimes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
fully
accept
the
decision
in
gainey
and
in
no
way
are
attempting
here
to
expand
it
with
reference
to
the
other
crimes.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
would
apply
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
likewise,
we
would
emphasize
the
rule
very
clearly
articulated
in
gainey
that
the
judge
is
not
to
suggest
to
the
jury
that
they
are
required
to
infer
a
guilt
from
presence,
but
are
merely
authorized
or
permitted
to
do
so.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct.
also
in
this
case
the
practice
suggested
is
the
better
practice
in
the
footnote,
gainey
was
not
followed,
but
that
is
only
because
this
case
came
up
–-
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
–
before
that
opinion
was
written.
with
reference
to
the
offense
of
producing,
which
we
say
is
a
broad
crime
indeed
from
practice
it
is
as
broad
in
the
sense
of
the
number
of
persons
it
covers
as
the
crime
of
distilling
without
bond.
it
seems
to
us,
the
language
there
lends
itself
to
that
conclusion.
carrying
on
the
business
of
distiller
really
means
distilling,
that
is
the
job
of
a
distiller.
here
we
talk
about
producing
distilled
spirits
that
seems
to
be
very
much
the
same
thing
or
at
least
to
lend
itself
to
an
equally
broad
construction.
it's
true
that
here
we
don't
have
the
same
number
of
precedents
showing
a
jurisprudence
in
the
lower
courts
of
reading
broadly
the
statute,
but
there
are
no
decisions
the
other
way,
are
they?
the
reasonable
conclusion
is
that
there
are
more
cases
in
which
the
charge
was
carrying
on
the
business
than
producing
without
permit,
the
reason
for
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
terms
of
the
time
that
which
it
comes
into
play,
it
is
narrower
and
that
reason
alone
suggests
why
there
are
more
cases
of
involving
carrying
on
the
business.
taking
into
account
the
presumption,
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
this
crime
also
is
one
broad
enough
to
encompass
all
those
likely
to
be
found
at
the
still,
especially
likely
to
be
found
at
the
still
at
the
very
moment
when
the
operation
is
in
full
--
during
runs
that
is
to
say
at
a
time
when
secrecy
is
most
important,
when
precautions
to
keep
outsiders
excluded
almost
strict,
at
a
time
when
those
connected
with
the
operation
are
least
anxious
to
be
caught
red
handed.
therefore
here,
perhaps
even
more
so
than
in
gainey,
the
inference
from
presence
at
this
most
incriminating
period
in
the
operation
of
the
still
quite
reasonably
justifies
the
conclusion
that
only
those
who
need
be
there,
are
there,
that
is
to
say
those
connected
in
some
business
way
with
the
still
operation
so
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
am
sorry
your
honor,
i
don't
know,
i
am
informed
that
it
is
a
place
of
about
3,000.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
should
hope
i
would
not
have
to
defend
that
presumption
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
so
may
other
innocent
bystanders
very
likely
to
be
there.
here,
the
peculiar
setting
of
moonshine
operations
makes
it
wholly
unlikely
that
anyone
who
need
not
be
there
will
choose
to
be
there,
will
find
the
site
or
will
be
permitted
to
be
there,
not
so
on
a
murder
scene,
which
rather
attracts
the
outsiders.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
don't
say
must,
mr.
justice
black.
we
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
the
trial
judge
–-
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
that
is
true
sir,
but
we
do
recognize
the
caveat
in
gainey
that
the
trial
judge
need
not
even
submit
to
the
jury
a
case
in
which
presence
is
shown
and
remains
unexplained.
i'll
save
what
minutes
i
have,
if
i
may,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
that
matter
is
fully
dealt
with
in
our
brief.
all
i
would
say
is
that
the
judge
was
careful
to
say
to
the
jury,
they
might,
but
need
not
evoke
the
inference
in
finding
guilt.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
objections
made
for
judgment.
