justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
it
would
not
have
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know
but
i
gather
this
means
on
the
chief
justice's
hypothesis,
there
had
been
a
second
trial
brought
promptly
by
the
governor
even
though
it
was
held
at
this
time
in
a
sentence
of
20
years
the
defendant
would
have
no
basis
to
come
here,
would
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
was
the
delay
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
expect
this
has
already
been
[inaudible]
but
i
just
want
to
be
clear
about
this.
as
i
--
originally
he
got
10
years
and
that
was
mandatory.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
in
the
posture
in
which
the
case
comes
to
us,
it's
only
under
the
4704(a)
account,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
he
served
two
years
under
4705(a)
count
but
he's
--
he's
no
longer
subsequently
prosecuted
for
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
for
the
last
one,
the
174
account,
is
now
that
matters.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
so
we're
only
here
then
on
the
4704(a)
and
the
consequences
of
this
is
that
if
the
government
prevails,
he
has
to
be
tried
on
that
count,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
will
be
on
the
same
evidence
i
take
it
with
these
--
at
the
trial
on
the
original
--
of
the
original
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
all
he
can
get
now
is
five
years
though
that's
mandatory.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
he
get
20
and
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
how
does
he
get
20?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
yeah.
