mr.
david
b.
lockton
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
briefly
go
back
over
what
i
think
are
the
salient
facts
here
because
as
the
district
court
found
it
was
on
the
basis
of
looking
at
all
of
these
facts
that
the
---
he
found
the
denial
of
these
two
constitutional
rights.
now,
in
the
original
proceeding
as
mr.
chief
justice
warren
has
pointed
out,
the
government
had
the
right
and
the
ability
to
indict
mr.
ewell
on
three
counts.
this
would
--
had
not
been
prohibited
by
gore.
i
mean
it
was
permis
--
made
permissible
by
the
gore
decision
and
for
some
reason,
unknown
of
record
they
did
not
and
then
he
relied
on
the
lauer
decision
and
set
his
conviction
aside,
the
government
instead
of
appealing
that
case
to
the
seventh
circuit
reprosecuted
him
this
time
with
two
additional
counts.
and
i
think
the
outstanding
fact
in
this
whole
case
is
found
on
page
25
of
the
record
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
district
court's
opinion,
“the
government
then
from
--
for
some
unknown
reason
of
record
other
than
the
express
concern
of
the
prospective
liberation
of
a
number
of
similarly
convicted
narcotic
felons
calls
a
grand
jury
to
indicting
on
the
two
extra
counts.
now
this
point
in
the
--
in
the
district
court's
opinion
has
not
been
controverted
in
any
brief
or
argument
in
any
stage
of
this
proceeding
and
remains
unchallenged.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
pardon.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
pardon
me,
page
25
of
the
record,
mr.
justice
black.
we
think
this
is
a
bad
reason
for
adding
these
counts
on
and
they
possibly
be
unconstitutional
in
its
own
right.
now
the
government
has
limited
its
appeal
to
the
dismissal
of
just
count
two
on
this
indictment.
and
have
done
so
as
--
because
of
the
problems
that
they
recognize
of
crediting
time
served
under
the
mandatory
sentencing
provisions
which
apply
to
counts
one
and
three.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
pardon
your
honor,
the
argument
i'm
making
now?
i'm
merely
going
through
the
facts.
i'm
not
--
i
do
argue
double
jeopardy
in
the
brief
but
i'll
--
i'll
get
to
that
later.
now
on
page
35
of
the
record,
government's
petition
for
rehearing,
the
government
sets
forth
their
reason
for
not
appealing
to
this
court
the
dismissal
of
the
counts
one
and
two
under
the
mandatory
sentencing
provisions
because
the
problem
that
they
recognize
of
crediting
time
under
--
under
these
two
particular
counts.
i'd
like
to
briefly
touch
on
the
subject
of
prejudice
under
these
two
counts
and
under
the
count
under
appeal.
it
was
argued
in
the
district
court
on
--
and
this
is
seen
on
page
11
of
the
record
in
our
brief
in
support
the
motion
to
dismiss
that
the
defendant
was
prejudiced
in
the
defense
of
the
charges
and
by
the
harassment
of
the
successive
prosecution
and
it
was
further
argued
that
because
of
the
time
served
in
--
on
his
prior
indictment,
the
prejudice
was
particularly
oppressive
in
this
case
because
of
the
problems
that
the
sentencing
provisions
rise
as
far
as
crediting
time.
now
the
government
did
not
at
any
time
and
i
repeat
did
not
at
any
time
denied
the
existence
of
any
of
this
prejudice
or
make
any
argument
concerning
the
existence
of
prejudice
and
did
not
even
argue
that
the
government
did
not
bare
the
burden
of
showing
prejudice.
on
the
contrary,
they
gave
recognition
to
the
existence
of
a
prejudice
under
these
counts
and
offered
to
dismiss
counts
one
and
two
upon
a
plea
or
a
finding
of
guilty
on
--
on
count
two
and
it's
probably
on
counts
one
and
three.
now
the
government
comes
before
this
court
and
asks
this
court
to
reverse
the
district
court
on
the
mere
unsupported
assertion
that
it
--
it
does
not
appear
that
there's
been
any
prejudice
in
this
case.
they
further
spend
approximately
20%
of
their
brief
arguing
that
there's
been
no
prejudice
under
counts
one
and
three
controverting
their
original
position
taken
into
petition
for
rehearing
and
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
in
their
brief
when
they
have
not
in
fact
appealed
these
two
counts.
now
we
think
that
--
that
we
have
made
a
showing
and
that
there's
a
definite
possibility
of
prejudice
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
it
is
not
prejudice
in
fact
that
this
court
must
find
or
that
the
district
court
must
find
but
it's
the
possibility
of
prejudice,
and
decisions
of
this
court
have
so
held.
now
as
far
as
the
speedy
trial
issue
and
i'm
addressing
myself
to
count
two
alone
because
this
was
the
count
that
the
government
has
appealed
to
this
court,
you
have
the
--
the
bare
facts
of
a
alleged
crime
on
october
31,
an
arrest
on
december
12
and
the
defendant
was
not
charged
with
the
violation
of
count
two
until
march
26,
1964
delayed
some
17
months,
all
this
time
he's
in
jail.
now
it's
clear
that
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
a
speedy
trial
even
though
he's
in
jail
and
the
reas
--
the
reason
for
this
is
obvious.
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
is
intended
to
protect
the
defendant
from
harm
that
may
arise
in
defending
himself
due
to
the
passage
of
time
and
this
of
course
applies
equally
well
to
a
defendant
who
has
to
be
in
jail
and
one
who
is
--
is
out
on
his
own
recognizance.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
it's
more
important
for
a
defendant
who's
in
jail
to
have
his
rights
speedily
prosecuted.
now
the
government
argues
in
its
brief
that
the
defendant's
right
to
a
speedy
trial
on
count
two
begins
with
the
filing
of
the
second
indictment.
we
think
this
is
clearly
wrong.
in
the
recent
case,
henry
hahn
case
in
the
district
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
this
is
a
--
a
very
same
argument
was
rejected
as
one
of
the
exalts
form
over
substance.
and
to
hold
otherwise
that
actually
give
the
government
the
power
to
evade
the
responsibility
to
bring
the
defendant
to
trial
on
these
charges
by
filing
successive
indictments,
charging
different
crimes
arising
from
the
same
act.
now
it
further
say
that
--
that
the
delay
should
be
excused
because
it
was
brought
about
by
the
defendants
setting
aside
of
his
original
conviction.
well,
as
the
district
court
found
the
reason
that
they
added
these
two
charges
on
was
in
effect
a
collateral
attack
on
the
lauer
decision
and
this
is
a
bad
reason
in
itself.
in
the
recent
opinion
in
the
second
circuit,
the
then
justice
marshall
but
now
honorable
solicitor
general
in
speaking
of
--
of
this
situation
in
an
appeal
context,
said
by
placing
this
on
consumable
premium
upon
a
successful
appeal
by
an
accused
a
vital
suicidal
interest
is
threatened
assuring
that
liberty
shall
not
be
deprived
without
a
trial
free
from
legal
error
prejudicing
the
accused's
substantial
rights.
well,
this
same
reasoning
we
think
--
mr.
david
b.
lockton
--
mr.
justice
fortas
--
mr.
david
b.
lockton
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
distinguish
them
only
in
the
matter
of
the
prejudice
arising
under
the
two
counts,
under
the
two
counts
--
under
the
4705(a)
and
the
original
count.
under
the
one
that
the
government
has
appealed,
there
is
a
prejudice
concerning
the
failure
to
inform
the
defendant
of
the
charge
under
4705(a),
in
fact
that
the
time
began
running
when
the
original
indictment
was
filed.
now,
the
prejudice
resulting
from
the
delay
under
4705(a)
is
of
course
the
prejudice
that
this
court
is
recognizing
in
the
mandatory
sentencing
provisions.
now,
i
did
not
argue
the
mandatory
sentence
provisions
in
my
brief
because
it
was
not
presented
by
this
appeal,
but
nevertheless
we
still
maintain
that
under
counts
one
and
three,
the
situation
is
exactly
the
same.
the
honorable
counsel
from
the
solicitor
general's
office
made
a
statement
that
if
this
delay
could
be
found
to
be
oppressive
or
purposeful,
then
he
would
concede
that
the
--
there
had
been
a
denial
of
a
speedy
trial.
and
we
think
in
either
one
of
these
cases
whether
it
be
the
oppressive
resulting
from
the
delay
in
charging
the
defendant
under
count
two
and
therefore,
searching
him
and
hampering
him
in
his
ability
to
defend
this
charge
or
the
prejudice
and
oppressiveness
of
this
prejudice
under
count
one
which
deals
with
the
mandatory
sentencing
provisions
makes
no
difference.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
count
two
is
the
stamped
package
violation
4704(a)
which
makes
it
a
crime
to
sell
narcotics
neither
from
nor
any
stamped
package.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
we
think
it's
purposeful
in
a
sense
that
these
charges
could
have
been
brought
at
any
time.
there's
no
case
in
this
court
or
any
other
court
which
--
which
would
now
prohibit
the
--
the
filing
of
these
charges
at
--
at
a
subsequent
time
within
the
statute
of
limitations.
and
certainly
the
cases
have
recognized
that
where
the
government
has
the
right
to
bring
charges
and
they
do
not
that
the
delay
of
bringing
them
is
purposeful
in
the
speedy
trial
context.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
others
--
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
there's
absolutely
no
question
that
we
would
not
be
here
on
the
double
jeopardy.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
question
in
tateo
i
think,
the
defendant
who
puts
doubts
on
this
matter
to
one
side.
on
the
speedy
trial
question
i
think
we
would
be
here
and
just
strongly
because
of
the
mandatory
sentencing
provisions
that
apply
to
the
count
one.
now
i'm
--
i'm
arguing
about
other
prejudice
under
count
two
because
there
is
the
possibility
and
i
say
--
and
i
underline
possibility
that
he
might
receive
credit.
however,
he
--
there's
a
possibility
that
he
may
receive
20
years
on
count
two.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
on
the
original
indictment?
mr.
david
b.
lockton
i
would
say
in
--
in
the
general
case,
yes,
but
i
wouldn't
concede
that
in
this
case
because
when
a
delay
results
in
prejudice,
there
is
a
denial
of
a
speedy
trial
and
the
prejudice
in
this
particular
case
would
be
the
inability
to
credit
time
under
the
mandatory
sentencing
provision.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
this
is
true
your
honor,
but
in
this
--
if
you
assume
that
there
is
no
delay
then
i
will
concede
that
there
would
be
no
denial
on
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
i
think
there
is
a
delay
in
this
case.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
i
would
concede
that
on
--
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
as
you
post
them.
i
think
that
under
speedy
trial
you
have
to
look
at
the
specific
facts.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
no.
if
there
would
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
there
was
no
delay
and
we
could
not
honestly
say
there
is
no
delay
--
mr.
david
b.
lockton
the
--
the
delay
was
approximately
fifteen
and
a
half
months
from
the
date
of
the
offense
until
the
date
of
the
charge
on
the
second
indictment
in
fifteen
and
a
half
months
from
the
date
of
arrest
until
the
date
of
the
second
indictment.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
december
18th
1962.
open
--
i
beg
your
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
that
was
january
13th
1964.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
march
26,
1964.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
that's
right.
we
--
we
concede
that
there
was
not
an
inordinate
delay
in
bringing
the
second
prosecution
but
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
prejudice
--
the
defendant
was
put
in
by
the
addition
of
these
counts
is
what
really
we
think
the
case
is
about.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
merely
the
prejudice
under
the
mandatory
sentencing
provisions
on
count
--
on
first
--
on
count
one
under
4705(a).
we
think
that
he
has
been
prejudiced,
we
are
now
again
into
fifth
amendment
argument.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
well,
i
would
rely
on
the
downum
case.
i
disagree
with
the
--
with
tateo
but
if
we're
going
to
talk
about
the
harassment
of
the
successive
prosecution,
this
is
another
prejudice
that
results
you
have
a
successive
prosecution.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
oh,
we
raised
the
additional
issue
of
the
right
to
be
informed
and
the
nature
and
the
cause
of
the
accusation.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
well
that
--
mr.
david
b.
lockton
your
honor
--
mr.
david
b.
lockton
you
are
correct,
mr.
justice
fortas.
he
does
note
this
time
and
--
and
finds
this
as
one
of
the
many
things.
i
think
the
fact
as
he
said
of
the
--
of
the
prosecution
and
we
argue
this
point
in
our
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
rehearing
which
is
--
which
is
found
on
page
36
of
the
record.
however,
we
have
not
brought
that
argument
in
our
brief
on
the
merits.
we
think
that
it's
a
definite
prejudice
but
we
think
there
are
a
lot
of
other
things
in
the
case,
even
more
prejudicial
than
the
delay
in
the
government
in
--
in
some
way
notified
him
at
least
that
he
was
now
being
held
on
a
--
a
judge
--
a
judgment
of
conviction
which
under
the
law
the
seve
--
the
seventh
circuit
was
the
indictment
failed
to
charge
a
crime.
now
under
the
fifth
amendment
that
--
we
feel
that
there
is
no
case
from
this
court
which
would
preclude
reindictment
on
count
4705(a)
and
we
think
that
was
decided
by
the
tateo
case.
however,
in
this
case,
you
have
a
successive
prosecutions
and
then
in
mr.
justice
brennan's
separate
opinion
in
the
abbate
case,
we
--
he
indicates
that
successive
prosecutions
for
the
same
act
are
barred
by
the
fifth
amendment
and
we
definitely
agree
with
this
opinion.
however,
in
this
case,
you
have
the
additional
fact
that
there
was
a
successful
collateral
attack
setting
aside
the
original
conviction.
now,
certainly
the
reasoning
under
this
case
would
apply
to
this
situation,
but
we
think
that
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
and
the
right
to
be
informed
of
the
nature
and
cause
of
the
accusation
is
more
importantly
applied
in
this
situation
because
under
these
particular
constitutional
acts
under
the
sixth
amendment,
the
--
the
reason
behind
the
delay
is
completely
irrelevant
that
the
acts
are
designed
to
protect
the
defendant
and
if
the
prejudice
resulting
from
the
passage
of
time
is
the
result
of
the
collateral
attack
or
anything
else,
we
definitely
think
that
provisions
of
these
acts
protect
the
--
the
defendant
under
the
sixth
amendment
in
there
are
cases
supporting.
i'd
like
to
briefly
reply
to
mr.
spritzer's
argument
that
there
has
been
no
showing
of
prejudice
in
the
record
on
this
account
under
4705(a).
now
under
the
narcotics
act,
the
case
is
recognized
that
even
the
slightest
delay,
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
recently
held
in
the
rochelle
case
that
a
delay
of
seven
months
from
the
date
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
until
the
date
of
the
charge
was
alleged
was
a
denial
of
due
process
and
the
reason
was
because
of
the
particular
area
we're
dealing
in
the
narcotics
act.
now
under
this
area
the
slightest
amount
of
prejudice
or
slightest
amount
of
delay
can
--
can
result
in
an
extreme
prejudice.
and
this
is
because
of
the
presumptions
of
guilt
contained
in
these
statutes
and
the
methods
used
in
enforcing
the
statutes.
now
for
instance,
under
4705(a),
a
crime
is
charged
only
for
the
sale
of
narcotics
to
a
person
who
does
not
possess
the
proper
written
order
form.
under
this
count
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
tax
stamp
package
referred
to
in
count
two
of
this
indictment,
the
count
before
this
court
is
completely
irrelevant.
now
you
have
a
high
hypothetical
case
of
a
man
charged
with
4705(a),
count
one.
he
pleads
guilty
and
that
after
he's
been
incarcerated
in
prison
for
15
months
for
the
first
time
he's
charged
for
the
violation
of
4704(a),
the
stamped
package
charge.
under
mr.
justice
clark's
opinion
in
the
harris
case,
the
narcotics
could
be
introduced
in
the
evidence
and
the
presumption
then
was
presume
the
absence
of
a
tax
stamped
package.
the
defendant
being
in
jail
and
informed
that
he
has
to
--
rebut
this
charge
lodged
for
the
first
time
after
a
considerable
delay,
might
find
it
impossible
because
of
the
presumptions
here
to
prove
his
innocence.
so
i
think
that
there
is
inherent
in
the
situation
here
in
these
two
particular
statutes
the
possibility
of
extreme
prejudice
that
might
result
from
even
the
slightest
delay.
i'd
like
briefly
to
turn
to
--
mr.
david
b.
lockton
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
because
they
have
not
appealed
that.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
that's
correct.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
the
identical.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
he
could
get
20
years
and
i
--
mr.
david
b.
lockton
because
--
because
the
sentencing
provisions
provide
that
before
a
second
offender
under
4705(a),
the
--
this
is
on
the
--
the
sheet
of
the
counts
that
the
solicitor
general
gave
you.
i
think
of
a
second
offense,
that's
--
mr.
david
b.
lockton
it's
five
to
20
years
so
there's
the
possibility
that
he
can
get
20
years
and
there's
nothing
in
the
law
that
will
require
the
judge
to
give
him
five
to
10
or
anything,
in
the
way
of
credit.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
it's
mandatory.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
it's
mandatory
in
the
sense
that
there
has
to
be
at
least
five
years
sentence.
there
could
be
no
probation.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
that
was
the
minimum
here.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
if
he
did
it
but
he's
not
required
to.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
and
to
further
more,
he's
pleaded
not
guilty
to
this
charge
and
--
and
he
--
as
i
point
it
out
--
mr.
david
b.
lockton
we
think
he
has
the
right
to
prove
his
innocence
on
--
on
the
second
account
because
he's
never
been
charged
with
it
before.
and
as
i
pointed
out
the
passage
of
time
here
is
--
mr.
david
b.
lockton
this
is
correct.
but
i
think
that
as
i've
pointed
out
in
my
hypothetical
under
these
two
statutes
and
the
presumptions
involved,
defending
the
statute
would
be
very
difficult
to
say
defending
this
count,
count
two
would
be
very
difficult
to
say
the
least.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
on
what
location?
mr.
david
b.
lockton
this
was
in
the
southern
district
of
indiana
at
the
indianapolis
division.
judge
hoer
was
the
judge
all
the
way
through
and
judge
decker
was
the
--
on
the
ewell
case
pardon
me
and
dennis,
it
was
judge
decker.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
they
have
not,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
this
is
correct
and
it
seemed
they're
arguing
these
two
counts
but
they
are
not
appealing.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
correct.
the
--
and
the
government's
failure
to
appeal
--
mr.
david
b.
lockton
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
that's
right.
mr.
david
b.
lockton
and
i
don't
even
cover
these
counts
in
my
brief.
i'd
like
to
point
out
what
we
feel
would
be
the
consequences
of
a
reversal
in
this
suit.
the
government
has
framed
its
argument
in
broad
terms
stating
that
the
decision
below
stands
for
the
proposition
that
persons
who
spend
time
in
prison
under
avoidable
conviction
may
not
be
tried
again
on
the
successive
indictment
after
a
collateral
attack.
but
we
don't
see
on
the
complicated
facts
in
this
case
and
the
--
and
the
many
issues
of
lauer
raised
by
these
facts
as
it
can
possibly
be
read
by
this
decision.
on
the
other
hand,
we
think
that
a
reversal
of
this
decision
might
stem
from
the
following
propositions.
that
the
government
has
the
right
to
add
charges
on
to
a
successive
second
indictment
which
it
was
held
from
the
first
for
the
purposes
of
discouraging
other
defendants
from
collaterally
attacking
their
appeals
as
the
district
court
notes
in
page
26
of
the
record.
it
might
further
stem
for
the
proposition
that
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
does
not
arise
from
the
date
of
the
offense
or
even
--
even
from
the
date
of
the
first
indictment
but
rather
that
the
government
can
in
effect
stop
the
time
running
by
filing
the
second
indictment
and
--
and
have
a
time
and
run
from
the
date
of
the
second
indictment
till
the
date
of
the
prosecution
just
contrary
to
--
to
many
decisions.
further
more,
i
think
it
would
search
the
question
the
holding
of
--
of
this
court
in
the
ponzi
case
that
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
always
in
jail
and
on
another
charge.
in
filing
we
think
that
the
record
before
this
court
which
does
not
present
the
evidence
against
the
defendant
and
which
it
contains
notes
denial
of
prejudice
on
the
part
--
on
the
part
of
the
government
is
inadequate
so
that
this
court
inadequate
so
inadequate
that
this
court
cannot
find
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
prejudice
existing
before
the
district
court
when
it
made
its
decision
and
therefore
confined
that
the
district
court
was
clearly
wrong.
now
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
argued
on
the
merits
that
the
record
can
only
support
some
finding
of
the
failure
to
inform
which
is
part
two
in
our
brief
and
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
and
the
double
jeopardy
argument
which
we
think
is
also
raised
by
this.
furthermore,
we
have
raised
the
jurisdictional
point
of
case
or
controversy.
now
the
government
in
their
jurisdictional
statement
appealed
merely
defining
that
the
--
the
defendant
have
been
denied
its
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
the
district
court
however
found
that
there
was
a
denial
of
two
separate
rights.
but
we
think
this
can
be
read
and
supported
by
the
record
below
in
the
basis
of
his
particular
concern
that
the
addition
of
these
charges
after
a
delay
of
time
solely
for
the
purpose
of
discouraging
others
similarly
situated
narcotic
felons
and
also
in
his
express
statement
that
the
--
the
following
rights
of
the
sixth
amendment
were
denied
by
the
prosecutions
below
and
in
quoting
“the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
and
the
right
to
be
informed
for
the
nature
and
cause
of
the
accusation”.
rule
--
under
the
rules
of
this
court,
the
government
is
precluded
from
raising
points
which
are
not
properly
presented
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
the
government
has
not
argued
the
right
to
be
informed
of
the
nature
and
cause
of
the
accusation
anywhere
in
its
brief.
we
think
the
record
clearly
supports
this
position
and
therefore
any
opinion
of
the
court
might
present
on
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
would
leave
this
independent
ground
standing
below
and
therefore
would
not
affect
the
defendant's
freedom
and
would
be
an
advisory
opinion.
we
therefore
feel
that
the
appeal
does
not
present
the
proper
case
or
controversy
required
to
give
the
court
jurisdiction
and
we
think
that
the
case
can
be
disposed
off
in
this
way.
thank
you.
