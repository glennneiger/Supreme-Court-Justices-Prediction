mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
by
the
united
states
from
two
judgments
of
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
to
indiana
entered
in
two
criminal
cases.
the
cases
are
consolidated
in
this
court.
to
begin
with
the
relevant
prior
proceedings,
in
december
of
1962,
each
of
the
appellees
pleaded
guilty
to
a
narcotics
violation,
an
offense
under
section
4705
of
the
revenue
code,
the
written
order
formed
provision.
each
received
at
that
time
the
minimum
sentence
permitted
by
the
statute.
that
was
10
years
in
the
case
of
ewell
and
he
was
a
second
offender
and
five
years
in
dennis’
case.
some
seven
months
after
this
conviction
in
an
unrelated
case,
lauer
against
the
united
states,
the
seventh
circuit
ruled
that
an
indictment
under
section
4705
was
defective
if
it
failed
to
name
the
purchaser
of
the
narcotics
and
it
held
moreover
that
this
defect
was
cognizable
on
collateral
attack.
relying
upon
that
decision,
ewell
several
months
after
initiated
proceedings
of
his
own
under
section
2255
and
dennis
followed
suit.
these
motions
were
promptly
heard.
they
were
granted
by
the
district
court
for
force
on
the
authority
of
the
lauer
decision
and
the
government
at
the
first
grand
jury
session
thereafter
procured
new
indictments
against
both
of
the
appellees.
appellees
thereupon
moved
to
dismiss
these
new
indictments
and
on
two
grounds;
one
a
claim
of
prior
jeopardy
and
two,
a
claim
that
to
retry
them
would
deny
them
a
right
of
speedy
trial.
the
district
court
rejected
the
claim
of
prior
jeopardy,
but
it
dismissed
the
indictments
on
the
sixth
amendment
ground
and
since
the
orders
were
based
upon
a
plea
in
bar
the
appeal
comes
directly
here.
at
no
point
in
the
processing
of
these
cases
was
there
any
protracted
delay.
for
convenience,
i've
asked
the
clerk
to
distribute
a
chart
which
gives
the
court
the
essential
chronology
and
though
i
will
not
take
the
time
to
go
over
the
dates
here,
i
think
your
honors
will
observe
that
these
cases
did
move
with
dispatch.
the
district
court's
opinion,
in
fact,
affirmatively
states
and
i
use
its
language
that
this
is
not
a
case
for
charges
of
neglect
against
the
government
or
the
defendant.
the
district
court
recognized
also
that
the
original
indictment
was
sufficient
under
the
law
as
it
stood
at
the
time
the
indictment
was
drawn.
also,
i
might
say
parenthetically
that
it
would
be
sufficient
today.
lauer
has
been
uniformly
rejected
in
all
of
the
other
circuits
in
which
the
point
has
been
raised
and
only
recently,
the
seventh
circuit
itself
overruled
the
lauer
position,
but
what
if
we
assume
that
there
was
error
as
distinguished
from
oppressive
fault
of
any
kind
in
the
government's
drafting
of
the
first
indictment.
presumably
there
is
error
of
some
kind
in
every
case
in
which
a
judgment
of
conviction
is
set
aside
whether
on
direct
appeal
or
on
collateral
attack.
yet
it
has
never
been
the
law
in
this
country
that
the
correction
of
error
on
the
defendant's
appeal
bars
a
retrial.
by
speaking
the
correction,
the
defendant
is
deemed
to
have
waived
any
claim
of
prior
jeopardy
and
only
recently
in
the
tateo
case,
the
court
will
recall
the
opinion
of
the
court
observed
that
this
rule
serves
the
interest
of
defendants
generally
as
well
as
of
the
public
for
otherwise
it
seems
doubtful
that
appellate
courts
would
be
so
ready
to
find
error
at
least
in
cases
where
the
evidence
of
guilt
was
compelling.
cases
like
tateo
and
many
others
which
we
might
cite
stand
equally
for
the
proposition
that
a
retrial
does
not
violate
the
provisions
of
the
sixth
amendment.
time
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
in
tateo
itself,
your
honor,
i
think
some
five
years
had
elapsed
between
the
date
of
conviction
and
the
date
when
the
section
2255
case
was
instituted.
i
don't
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
or
to
argue
in
this
case
that
there
could
never
be
circumstances
in
which
a
retrial
would
present
a
problem
under
the
sixth
amendment.
time
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
and
i'm
going
to
get
separately
to
the
question
whether
we
have
a
differentiating
circumstance
in
this
case
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
–
because
the
reindictment
set
out
three
offenses
here.
the
district
court's
decision,
your
honor
will
recall
was
they'd
simply
upon
the
proposition
that
a
retrial
could
not
occur
here
because
of
the
passage
of
time.
the
court
said
that
the
necessity
for
setting
aside
the
conviction
was
the
result
of
an
inconsistency
in
the
developing
law
and
that
the
defendant
should
not
be
tax
with
the
consequence
of
that
inconsistency
in
the
law.
and
that
reasoning
would
apply,
had
we
brought
the
new
indictment
under
precisely
the
same
charge
as
well
as
to
the
situation
as
it
comes
to
the
court
where
the
us
attorney
brought
the
same
charge
and
additional
charges.
now
there
is
a
strong
suggestion
in
the
opinion
and
i
think
that
explains
the
result
perhaps
that
the
district
court
was
motivated
by
a
concern
as
to
the
sentence
which
it
would
have
to
adjudge
in
the
event
of
a
re-conviction.
it
pointed
out
that
the
narcotics
statutes
contain
a
provision
for
a
minimum
sentence
and
the
minimum
penalties
had
in
fact
been
imposed
at
the
first
conviction
of
these
appellees.
the
court
also
noted
that
the
narcotic
statutes
prohibit
the
suspension
of
sentence
or
the
suspension
of
the
imposition
of
sentence
and
that
they
do
not
allow
for
probation.
and
the
judge
concluded
from
this
that
if
the
appellees
were
convicted
anew,
they
could
not
be
credited
with
the
time
that
they
had
already
served
some
19
months
under
the
invalidated
conviction.
we
doubt
that
the
district
court
was
correct
in
this
analysis.
the
narcotic
statutes
do
indeed
prescribe
a
minimum
sentence
which
cannot
be
suspended,
but
it
does
not
seem
to
me
to
follow
necessarily
from
this;
that
the
court
could
not
credit
time
already
served
under
an
invalidated
conviction
resting
upon
the
identical
transaction.
i
suggest
that
it
could
impose
the
minimum
term
less
the
time
already
served.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
unless
there
were
some
constitutional
requirement,
it
would
not
have
to.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
have
found
no
cases
one
way
or
the
other
casting
upon
on
the
question.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
i
can
tell,
your
honor
something
about
the
practice
which
the
district
court
in
indiana
where
this
case
comes
from
has
followed
in
an
identical
group
of
cases
which
followed
the
lauer
decision.
in
all
of
those
cases,
the
government
did
what
it
did
here.
in
addition
to
indicting
under
the
section
4705
offense
which
i
mentioned
earlier,
it
charged
other
offenses
based
on
the
same
transaction.
your
honor,
will
find
the
three
statutes
on
this
little
chart
we've
submitted.
in
all
of
those
cases
which
have
been
disposed
off
to
date,
the
court
passed
sentence
under
section
4704
which
carries
a
lesser
penalty.
the
government
agreed
to
a
dismissal
of
the
offenses
involving
the
heavier
charge
and
the
district
court
then
imposed
a
sentence
less
than
the
original
sentence
imposed
and
one
which
in
effect
therefore
gave
credit
for
the
time
already
served.
now
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
the
original
indictment?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
certainly
i'm
sure
that
was
true
in
some
of
the
cases.
whether
it
was
true
in
all,
i
cannot
say,
i
would
have
to
check
the
records
of
those
separate
cases.
they
had
a
group
of
10
or
perhaps
15
cases
in
which
collateral
proceedings
were
brought
in
the
wake
of
this
lauer
decision
because
it
apparently
in
the
regular
practice
of
the
us
attorney
in
this
district
to
charge
4705
without
naming
the
purchaser
and
they
had
a
group
of
these
cases
come
forward.
and
i
understand
that
those
that
-
that
have
been
disposed
off
to
date
have
been
disposed
off
in
the
way
i've
indicated,
but
i
have
not
read
the
original
indictments
and
the
reindictments
in
each
of
those
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
and
i
know
of
no
opinion
which
discusses
the
question
of
the
power
of
the
court
to
do
what
i've
suggested.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
language
of
the
statute
and
if
it
be
true
as
appellees
contest,
that
there
would
be
a
constitutional
doubt
if
a
sentence
which
did
not
give
credit
were
imposed
upon
a
retrial
that
would
reinforce
i
think
the
thought
that
the
statute
might
be
construed
to
permit
that
limit.
now
there
are
cases,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
cases
involving
the
lauer
problem
or
narcotic
cases
in
particular
where
the
courts
had
re
--
had
imposed
a
heavier
sentence
on
a
retrial.
cases
of
this
court
have
had
set
aside
convictions
later
resulted
in
heavier
penalty
and
that's
not
rare
event,
but
insofar
as
there
should
be
any
constitutional
problem
which
might
arise
in
circumstances
where
it
might
be
thought
that
a
court
was
discouraging
resort
to
legal
process
by
imposing
a
heavier
sentence
in
the
event
of
a
re-conviction
to
the
extent
of
that
might
present
a
problem,
i
say
it
isn't
presented
here
and
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
even
in
the
event
of
a
re-conviction
under
all
of
the
charges
which
were
brought
on
the
second
indictment,
the
judge
could
impose
concurrent
sentences
and
i
think
could
give
credit
for
time
already
served.
beyond
that,
we
have
attempted
to
remove
that
problem
from
this
case
altogether.
the
united
states
attorney
advised
the
district
judge
when
the
government
petitioned
for
rehearing
of
his
order
dismissing
the
indictment;
that
if
the
defendants
here
were
found
guilty
under
the
4704
charge
which
carries
the
lesser
penalty,
that
the
government
proposed
to
dismiss
the
other
charges.
moreover
in
taking
our
appeal
to
this
court
in
order
to
emphasize
that
we
were
seeking
to
avoid
any
problem
as
any
sentencing
problem,
we
purposely
confined
ourselves
to
an
appeal
from
that
portion
of
the
order
dismissing
the
indictment
which
related
to
the
dismissal
of
the
4704
charge
and
that
is
all
that
is
in
the
case
as
it
comes
to
this
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
that
problem
could
only
arise
if
the
judge
gave
a
heavier
sentence
or
a
sentence
which
failed
to
credit
and
that
it
is
not
presented
at
least
until
the
sentencing
stage
is
reached
in
a
case
and
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
and
i
would
say
that
no
constitutional
problem
could
arise
in
relation
to
the
problem
of
an
increased
sentence
or
would
arise
unless
and
until
an
increased
sentence
was
in
fact
imposed.
let
me
take
a
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
if
he
sat
and
steam
on
the
other
charge
but
gave
full
credit
for
time
already
served
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i've
communicated
fully
because
the
additional
--
neither
of
the
additional
charges
which
had
been
made
carries
a
heavier
penalty
than
the
charge
which
was
originally
made.
did
i
make
that
clear,
your
honor?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
that
would
be
true
under
the
original
charge
also
if
that
argument
were
--
were
the
correct
conclusion.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
the
--
the
original
charge
is
again
before
the
judge
and
two
additional
charges.
now
however
one
looks
at
it
whether
the
new
indictment
was
on
the
4705
count
again
or
whether
that
was
--
were
on
that
count
and
two
others.
the
problem
would
be
there,
can
we
give
credit
for
time
already
served?
if
he
were
tried
again
under
the
original
charge,
4705,
the
minimum
sentence
for
dennis
would
be
five
years
and
for
ewell
would
be
10
years.
and
the
question
whether
credit
can
be
given
would
be
there
if
you
were
being
tried
today
under
the
identical
charge
and
that
charge
alone.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
right.
i
wouldn't
restrict
it
to
the
question
of
constitutional
doubts.
we
think
we
want
to
give
the
judge
the
flexibility
as
a
matter
of
--
of
good
criminal
procedure
as
quite
apart
from
any
constitutional
rights
and
conduct.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
i
think
the
law
would
permit
him
to
credit
time
as
i've
indicated
even
if
we
brought
the
charge
only
under
the
original
charge
by
bringing
the
lesser
charge
as
well
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
base
upon
the
same
transaction.
any
possible
doubt
as
to
whether
the
statute
permits
accrediting
of
time
is
removed
and
we
have
sought
to
avoid
that
doubt
because
we
are
--
have
no
quarrel
--
quarrel
with
the
district
judge's
concern
that
he
should
not
be
obliged
to
ignore
that
time
already
served.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
have
asked
the
court
to
send
the
case
back
for
trial
only
on
a
single
count.
that
is
all
we
brought
here
on
our
appeal
and
that
single
account
is
an
a
count
which
carries
the
least
penalty,
a
lesser
penalty
within
the
count
which
was
originally
charged.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
and
i
don't
–
whether
he
can
be
tried
on
the
other
counts
is
not
something
your
honors
need
to
decide
because
we
haven't
appealed
from
the
dismissal
of
the
other
counts,
your
honor.
the
only
question
we
have
presented
is
whether
the
judge
correctly
threw
out
the
entire
indictment
and
whether
we
are
permitted
to
go
to
trial.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
in
or
--
in
order
to
avoid
any
sentencing
problem,
we're
only
asking
to
go
to
trial
on
one
count.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
do
discuss
it
very
briefly.
we
don't
have
any
citations
of
authority
on
the
point
because
the
point
has
--
has
not
been
discussed
in
any
opinion
that
we
are
aware
of.
it's
rather
unusual
that
it
comes
up
in
this
precise
context
because
here
you
have
a
statute
which
provides
a
minimum
penalty.
most
of
our
criminal
laws
that
they
do
provide
minimum
penalties
don't
provide
such
stringent
penalties
as
do
the
narcotic
statutes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
are
very
few
statutes
and
i
don't
immediately
call
to
mind
any
others
which
prohibit
the
suspension
of
the
sentence
or
probation.
your
honor
is
aware
that
congress
became
greatly
concerned
about
narcotics
traffic
and
that
there
was
a
strong
push
to
make
the
penalties
more
stringent
several
years
ago.
this
was
one
of
the
consequences
of
that.
it
is
not
generally
true
in
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
understand
the
beginning
of
your
honors
question.
i
heard
the
last
of
it.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh
yes,
there's
been
considerable
criticism,
i
think
of
the
statutes.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
statute
can
be
read
to
give
any
general
discretion.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
rather
that
the
prohibition
on
suspension
of
sentence
need
not
be
read
prohibit
--
the
word
suspension
or
prohibition
of
suspension
of
sentence
need
not
be
read
to
preclude
giving
credit
for
time
already
served.
i
would
say
that's
not
a
suspending
sentence
and
i
think
consistently
with
the
statute
rigid
though
it
maybe
in
its
general
application,
credit
might
be
given
for
time
already
served
for
that
transaction.
the
appellees
make
a
suggestion
they
cast
it
in
jurisdictional
terms
and
i'd
like
to
take
a
moment
to
--
to
answer
it.
they
suggest
that
the
district
court's
opinion
can
be
read
as
resting
on
two
holdings
under
the
sixth
amendment.
they
say
that
the
court
held
not
only
that
the
right
of
speedy
trial
was
denied
but
also
held
that
the
right
to
be
informed
of
the
charges
was
denied.
and
they
base
that
from
the
fact
that
the
district
court
in
setting
out
the
sixth
amendment
in
its
opinion
referred
not
only
--
quoted
“not
only
the
language
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
a
speedy
and
public
trial”
but
went
on
to
spoke
proportion
and
to
be
informed
of
the
nature
and
cause
of
the
accusation.
as
i
think
i've
earlier
indicated
the
reasoning
of
the
court
is
entirely
directed
to
the
question
whether
delays
occurred,
the
law's
delays
which
preclude
a
retrial,
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
indictment
doesn't
inform.
indeed
the
present
indictment
is
most
specific
and
it
seems
to
us
perfectly
clear
that
the
requirement
--
the
informing
requirement
have
to
be
met
in
advance
of
trial
and
that
it
doesn't
relate
to
whatever
delays
there
may
have
been
between
the
time
of
the
offense
and
the
time
of
the
indictment.
it
is
the
function
of
the
speedy
trial
requirement
to
assure
that
a
case
is
processed
with
reasonable
dispatch.
however
appellees
cast
this
argument
in
the
jurisdictional
frame.
they
say
this
was
beholding
of
the
court
and
the
government's
notice
of
appeal
was
restricted
to
the
question
whether
there
was
a
denial
of
the
right
of
speedy
trial.
i
don't
think
that
claim
does
stand
up.
your
honors
will
note
that
the
motions
to
dismiss
the
indictments
in
these
cases
were
based
on
two
grounds
and
two
only,
one,
prior
jeopardy,
two,
denial
of
the
right
of
speedy
trial.
no
reference
was
made
to
any
claim
that
the
indictment
as
presently
drawn,
did
not
sufficiently
inform.
moreover,
the
opinion,
the
dispositive
part
of
the
opinion,
is
fortunately
unusually
clear
in
this
case.
your
honors,
will
note
at
page
26
of
the
record,
“the
court
now
grants,”
this
is
the
district
court's
order,
“the
amended
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
base
on
ground
two
and
denies
the
motion
as
based
on
ground
one.”
as
i've
indicated
the
motions
made
no
reference
to
any
other
kind
of
sixth
amendment
claim.
the
order
in
the
companion
case
is
precisely
the
same
and
so
i
think
there
is
no
question
before
the
court
other
than
the
question
whether
the
attempt
to
retry
the
case
results
in
the
denial
of
a
speedy
trial.
we
think
that
here
clearly
it
is
not
and
that
the
ordinary
practice
which
prevails
after
a
successful
appeal
or
a
successful
collateral
attack
does
permit
retrial
as
the
indictment
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
quite
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
correct.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
let
me
take
the
prior
jeopardy
first
because
i
think
we
--
there,
the
answer
to
that
is
perhaps
quickly
made.
the
cases
make
perfectly
and
unbroken
line
of
decision
to
this
court
that
these
appellees
could
be
tried
under
the
original
indictment
if
under
the
charge
contained
in
the
original
indictment,
if
that
--
if
retrial
on
the
same
charge,
does
not
involve
prior
jeopardy.
i
don't
think
that
retrial
on
a
different
charge
could
involve
any
question
of
double
jeopardy.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
so
i
think
it
is
a
question
of
speedy
trial
and
thought
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
but
going
to
the
first
part
of
your
honor's
question,
the
reindictments
in
this
case
were
within
two
years
of
the
original
transactions
and
we
are
operating
here
under
a
five-year
statute
of
limitations.
so
i
think
the
fact
that
the
charges
are
cast
in
different
form
on
the
second
indictment
could
present
a
problem
under
the
speedy
trial
decisions
of
this
court
only
if
that
delay
were
in
some
way
purposeful
or
oppressive
as
the
court
has
put
in.
a
two
year
delay
is
not
in
of
itself
a
denial
of
right
of
speedy
trial.
the
court
normally
takes
the
view
that
the
measure
of
time
for
bringing
in
an
indictment
is
the
statute
of
limitations
unless
some
specific
prejudice
results
from
a
delay
in
bringing
in
the
indictment.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
not
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
it
did.
i
think
one
of
the
purposes
that
i've
been
talking
about
to
remove
any
question
as
to
the
flexibility
of
the
judge's
sentencing
powers
is
certainly
not
an
oppressive
one
and
the
kind
of
prejudice
to
which
i
refer
when
i
say
prejudice
from
delay
in
bringing
the
indictment
and
i
think
the
kind
of
prejudice
to
which
the
cases
refer
is
prejudice
in
terms
of
ability
to
defend
against
the
charge.
now
there
has
been
no
claim
and
there
is
no
much
less
a
demonstration
that
there
will
be
any
prejudice
in
defending
against
4704
as
distinguished
from
4705
in
terms
of
ability
to
defend
against
the
charge.
the
proof
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
i
understand
your
honors
point
and
our
answer
is
that
the
decisions
applying
the
speedy
trial
concept
have
said
that
the
court
must
look
to
see
whether
the
proceeding
as
it
has
gone
forward
involves
any
purposefully
damaging
or
oppressive
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
government.
and
we
say
there
is
a
sound
and
a
fair
explanation
of
the
decision
to
reindict
the
defendants
here
in
the
manner
that
was
done
and
one
which
has
not
been
shown
to
work
any
specific
prejudice
in
terms
of
their
ability
to
defend
against
the
charge.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
without
a
written
order
form
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
the
stamp,
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
quite
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
was
i
would
say
in
altogether
different
case
because
that's
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
think
that
we
could
not
bring
repetitive
charges
based
upon
the
same
transaction
after
he
had
been
acquitted
or
convicted
of
one
even
though
we
could
have
charged
the
multiple
transactions
under
the
blockburger
harris
rule
at
the
same
time.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'd
say
this
is
an
altogether
different
case
because
the
wiping
out
of
the
first
conviction
at
the
behest
of
the
defendant
who
brought
the
collateral
attack
leaves
matters
entirely
as
if
no
charge,
no
trial
had
ever
taken
place.
and
i
think
we
can
bring
an
indictment
on
the
second
occasion
for
any
offenses
relating
to
the
transaction
at
least
so
long
as
the
course
of
proceeding
followed
does
not
result
in
any
oppression
or
harassment
as
could
conceivably
result
if
us
attorneys
or
prosecutors
were
to
follow
a
general
practice
of
piling
on
charges
in
the
event
that
somebody
has
successfully
appealed.
that
i
think
would
present
a
problem.
that
is
a
problem
that
is
said
to
have
arisen.
i
don't
know
the
facts
in
the
wake
of
this
court's
gideon
decision
in
articles
written
not
too
long
ago
in
yale
law
journal
suggesting
that
in
some
jurisdictions
after
prisoners
invoked
the
rule
of
gideon
and
got
a
retrial,
it
had
been
seeming
--
become
seemingly
the
invariable
practice
to
give
them
the
same
sentence
all
over
again
with
no
credit
for
time
already
served
even
if
it
was
five
or
10
years.
now
if
your
honors
had
a
situation
where
a
prosecutor
or
a
court
or
the
two
combined
were
utilizing
the
judicial
power
in
a
way
which
your
honors
concluded
was
calculated
to
deter
people
from
invoking
their
legal
remedies,
i
think
that
would
present
a
due
process
question.
i
don't
see
anything
comparable
in
the
situation
that
your
honors
have
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
rely
on
the
line
of
cases
such
as
ball
and
tateo
which
indicate
that
if
one
invokes
a
collateral
remedy
he
maybe
retried.
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
the
government
is
here
proceeding
against
the
same
transaction
under
a
different
statute
alters
the
principle
that
the
prior
conviction
does
not
operate
as
a
bar.
it's
a
nullity
under
the
cases
and
the
government
can
proceed
as
it
initially
could
have
proceeded
i
rely
upon
those
cases.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he
was
convicted?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
know
of
any
of
your
honors'
decisions
on
that
question.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
one
of
the
differences
your
honor
is
that
none
of
the
offenses
here
charged
carries
a
different
penalty,
a
heavier
penalty.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
the
charge
originally
made
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
perfectly
true
with
the
statutes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
know.
i
think
that
would
present
perhaps
a
--
a
due
process
question
if
it
were
thought
that
the
consequences
of
saying
he
could
be
would
be
to
deter
defendants
from
exercising
their
appellate
remedies.
the
closest
case
that
i
know
of
that
your
honors
had
to
the
one
your
honor
just
posed
was
the
situation
where
in
the
green
case.
and
there
i
think
your
honors
found
that
the
conviction
of
manslaughter
on
a
charge
where
the
charge
had
been
murder
carried
with
it
an
implied
finding
at
least
of
the
first
jury
that
the
elements
of
murder
weren't
present
and
in
that
situation
your
honors
held
that
he
could
not
be
tried
again
for
murder.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
the
nearest
case
i
know
of
one
your
honors
--
