justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
authority
to
that
you
know
whether
that
has
been
done,
mr.
spritzer?
justice
abe
fortas
you're
[inaudible]
--
right
to
this
law.
is
there
any
pressman
in
the
actual
practice
of
the
district
courts?
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
you're
saying
of
[inaudible],
you
know
of
no
precedent
whether
in
a
reported
case
or
in
the
practice
of
district
courts
for
allowing
credit
under
a
--
in
a
narcotic
act
conviction
where
time
already
served.
justice
abe
fortas
have
you
briefed
your
point
that
the
judge
could
give
credit
for
the
prior
conviction.
i
don't
remember
it
in
your
brief.
perhaps,
i've
just
forgotten
it.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
know
of
any
other
statute
in
which
the
same
problem
would
exist
under
any
of
federal
statute
in
which
the
same
problem
would
exist
where
this
is
peculiar
to
the
narcotics
and
that
is
to
say
that
statute
has
mandatory
minimum
coupled
with
the
prohibition
of
probation?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
spritzer,
i'm
concerned
about
--
about
this
aspect
of
the
case
as
i
understand
it
the
original
indictment
was
for
one
offense
on
the
4705
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now
the
subsequent
indictment
after
the
lauer
case
was
for
three
offenses.
justice
abe
fortas
two
of
them
being
under
different
provisions
of
the
statute.
now
is
that
in
your
--
as
you
view
this
case
present
us
with
a
different
problem
with
respect
to
a
speedy
trial
that
is
to
say
at
what
--
respect
to
the
other
two
sections
of
the
statute,
these
respondents
were
not
put
on
trial
until
the
time
of
the
second
--
until
after
the
second
indictment
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
lauer
case
concerned
only
4705
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
apart
from
that,
these
respondents
were
put
on
trial
for
the
first
time
and
on
the
basis
of
the
second
indictment
and
not
the
first
indictment
and
the
second
indictment
as
i
understand
it
was
based
upon
the
same
transaction
as
the
first
indictment.
my
question
is
whether,
to
your
mind,
that
makes
any
difference
with
respect
to
the
--
at
least
the
issue
of
a
speedy
trial
perhaps
also
although
i'm
not
clear
about
this
at
all,
perhaps
also
the
question
of
prior
jeopardy.
justice
abe
fortas
well
perhaps
--
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps
you
can
say
that
what
i'm
concerned
about
is
that
the
reasoning
of
the
holding
in
lauer
is
addressed
only
to
4705
and
i
won't
burden
you
with
that
you
go
ahead
with
the
speedy
trial
point?
justice
abe
fortas
well
maybe
--
maybe
there
is
some
prejudice
here
if
it
--
if
the
government
have
to
confine
itself
to
the
same
count
that
was
in
the
original
indictment
i
take
it
from
your
argument
that
there
would
have
been
some
legal
problems
which
you
think
maybe
obligated
by
the
availability
of
the
4704
count.
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
the
government
entered
these
two
counts
for
some
purpose
i
suppose
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
subsequent
indictment.
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
--
i
don't
want
to
take
anymore
of
your
time.
the
problem
that
bothers
me
is
with
respect
to
the
delay
under
4705.
the
government
has
searched
that
you
have
the
reason
of
the
intervening
lauer
case.
justice
abe
fortas
now
if
you
consider
4704
and
the
other
count
of
the
indictment,
well
it
is
a
question
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
the
government
had
a
legal
--
legally
permissible
reason
for
the
delay,
that's
â€“
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
do
i
take
it
then
that
your
point
is
that
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
was
denied
here
with
respect
to
the
two
counts
that
were
not
in
the
initial
indictment?
are
you
making
the
same
point
with
respect
to
the
4705
count?
as
an
analytical
matter.
i
realize
that
the
government
has
presented
to
us
only
the
4704
issue
but
as
an
analytical
matter
do
you
distinguish
between
those
two?
that
is
to
say
the
new
counts
are
read
in
the
second
indictment
as
against
the
count
that
was
in
the
first
indictment
and
repeated
in
the
second
indictment.
justice
abe
fortas
what
--
what
is
count
two?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
is
it
your
point,
part
of
your
point
that
the
addition
of
these
two
counts
to
the
second
indictment
does
come
within
the
definition
of
the
--
of
purpose
collection
by
the
government
in
this
purpose?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
lockton
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
doesn't
the
court
below
with
respect
to
the
questions
asked
a
little
while
ago,
then
the
court
below
would
indicate
some
discomfort
to
say
the
least
with
the
period
between
july
17,
1963
rehearing
was
denied
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
lauer
and
the
time
that
the
second
indictment
was
returned
namely
march
26,
1964
and
as
i
recall,
the
court
below
points
out
that
the
government
made
no
effort
to
vacate
the
previous
conviction
after
lauer
came
down
that
the
dennis
--
that
lauer,
that
the
respondent
here
took
the
initiative
and
it
wasn't
entailed
march
of
1964
that
second
indictment
was
returned.
is
my
recollection
is
correct
that
the
court
does
--
justice
abe
fortas
has
the
government
dismissed
the
counts
on
the
4705
and
174?
justice
abe
fortas
well
[inaudible]
saying
that
they're
appealing
only
from
4704
here.
