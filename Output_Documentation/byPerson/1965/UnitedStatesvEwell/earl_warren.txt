mr.
spritzer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
those
--
are
those
cases
limited
to
the
identical
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
i
probably
didn't
--
didn't
speak
correctly.
what
i
wanted
to
know
was
are
those
cases
that
you
mentioned
limited
to
a
retrial
of
the
same
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
they're
originally
tried
for.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
he
was
not
charged
with
a
violation
of
3704?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
court
--
trial
court
refuse
to
follow
the
district
attorney
and
the
man
was
convicted
of
all
three
times
and
he
then
gave
him
10
years
under
the
--
one
of
the
other
counts,
what
would
your
position
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
is
tried
for
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he's
tried
for
it,
isn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
should
be
tried
for
all
three?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
just
take
--
let's
just
take
the
--
the
simple
case.
suppose
this
man
was
all
back
and
he's
retried
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
is
convicted
for
the
identical
offense
that
he
was
first
charged
for
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
maybe
also
this
count
2
that
your
--
that
you've
added
on
the
second
indictment
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
suppose
the
judge
said,
“well,
i'm
not
going
to
follow
the
district
attorney
in
dismissing
this
count
1.
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
sentence
him
under
that
count
and
he
does
sentence
him
under
that
count.
what
does
you
--
whether
he
gives
him
a
--
the
sentence
on
the
other
to
run
concurrently
or
consecutively
would
make
little
difference
in
my
question?
what
will
you
say
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
oh
no,
no,
no,
no.
that's
--
let's
--
let
--
let
just
take
it
the
way
it
is.
he
gave
them
--
he
gave
them
the
sentence,
any
sentence
under
that
section
which
is
would
be
greater
than
the
sentence
that
he
could
have
gotten
--
he
could
get
under
this
one
you
want
now
wanting
to
be
convicted
under?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
it's
--
it's
heavier
in
the
sense
that
at
least
it's
arguable
that
the
court
cannot
mean
time
off
for
the
time
he
has
already
served.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
but
it
wasn't
before
him
on
the
original
charge.
he
didn't
have
any
time
served.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
i
suppose
it's
because
of
the
constitutional
doubts
that
you
have
that
you
state
to
the
trial
judge
that
you
will
not
ask
him
to
sentence
him
under
the
original
charge
or
one
of
the
other
counts
but
you
will
char
--
you
will
ask
him
to
sentence
him
only
on
this
count
where
it
is
very
clear
that
he
can
have
his
sentence
reduce
by
the
amount
of
time
that
he
spent
in
the
--
in
the
penitentiary
under
the
original
charge.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
does
the
district
attorney
give
the
judge
that
flexibility
or
does
the
law
give
it
to
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
as
i
understand
you,
you
urge
upon
the
court
that
even
though
you
have
doubts
as
to
validity
of
any
conviction
that
might
be
held
under
count
one
and
three
that
you
ask
is
to
send
the
case
back
so
that
he
can
be
tried
under
one
and
three
as
well
as
two.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
authority
do
you
want
us
to
use
in
saying
that
he
cannot
be
tried
on
the
other
counts.
it's
not
constituted
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
[inaudible]
discussion
as
to
over
these
sections
that
are
involved
here
to
the
effect
that
the
judge
one
of
the
faults
of
the
--
of
the
statutes
are
that
the
judge
has
no
discretion
at
all
and
therefore
it
is
too
rigid.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
--
you
say
that
the
judge
does
has
some
discretion
now
to
--
to
grant
time
off
for
--
for
time
served
in
this
situation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
said
hasn't
there
been
considerable
discussion
of
the
statutes
that
are
involved
to
the
effect
that
they
are
--
are
too
rigid
because
the
judge
does
not
have
any
discretion
of
any
kind
that
he
must
automatically
sentence
him
to
the
term
prescribed
by
the
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
spritzer,
i'm
concerned
about
the
same
matter
that
justice
fortas
is,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
this.
now
this
man
was
charged
originally
with
a
sale,
simple
sale
of
narcotics.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
the
original
order,
that's
all
he's
charged
with.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
incident
to
that
and
as
a
part
of
that
transaction,
he
could
also
have
been
charged
with
importing
without
--
without
paying
the
duty,
to
be
charge
without
registering
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
stamps
and
so
forth,
several
things.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
now
let
--
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
--
suppose
that
he
was
tried
on
the
sale
and
was
not
indicted
for
these
other
things
at
the
time,
and
he
was
either
convicted
or
acquitted
on
the
--
on
the
simple
sale
charge,
could
the
government
then
indict
him
and
try
him
on
his
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
no,
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
i
--
all
i
asked
you
was
whether
they
could
do
it
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
case
in
this
court
would
most
nearly
support
your
--
your
argument
on
this
point?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
man
was
charged
originally
with
--
with
manslaughter
and
he
was
convicted
and
the
case
was
reversed
and
remanded
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
convicted,
yes,
as
this
–
as
this
man
was
and
it
went
back
and
he
was
then
charged
with
murder.
would
--
would
that
charge
lie?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
be
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
my
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
might
be
that
and
he
would
give
him
20
years
for
--
for
manslaughter,
voluntary
manslaughter
and
--
on
a
second
trial
with
he
is
convicted
to
second
through
murder
he
might
only
give
him
15
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
could
he
be
--
could
he
be
tried
for
it,
that's
the
question
not
to
what
the
judge
might
give
him
but
could
he
be
tried
for
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
lockton.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lockton,
may
i
ask
you
this.
if
this
case
had
been
reversed
as
it
was
originally
and
went
back
to
the
trial
court,
and
the
case
was
presented
for
trial
on
the
identical
indictment,
would
you
be
here
either
on
your
--
your
once
in
jeopardy
or
your
one
of
a
speedy
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
do
concede
that
--
you
would
concede
i
suppose
that
--
that
if
the
case
was
reversed
and
sent
back
for
a
retrial
on
the
original
indictment
and
the
government
did
not
delay
it
unconsciously
that
there
would
be
no
speedy
trial
issue
involved?
chief
justice
earl
warren
original
indictment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
that
have
been
in
the
case
no
matter
how
speedily
the
government
had
--
had
handled
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
i'd
say
if
there
--
if
there
is
no
unnecessary
delay
and
that
it
had
merely
gone
through
the
routine
of
going
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
being
reversed
in
going
back
for
a
new
trial
in
the
absence
of
conduct
on
--
on
the
part
of
the
government
delay.
in
the
normal
case,
it
would
not
be
a
speedy
trial
issue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
--
what
prejudice
by
the
original
count
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that's
--
that's
what
i'm
talking
about
where
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
was
only
talking
about
either
--
either
once
in
jeopardy
or
a
speedy
trial,
the
only
two
issues
i
thought
were
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
i
--
i
recall
it.
