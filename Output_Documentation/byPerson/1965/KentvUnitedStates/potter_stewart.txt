justice
potter
stewart
he
got
that
criminal
of
two
life
sentences
as
the
result
of
the
trial
in
district
court
at
which
he
had
counsel
from
first
to
last,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
and
it
was
the
result
of
that
trial,
and
only
as
a
result
of
that
trial,
that
he
received
the
sentence
to
which
you
refer.
justice
potter
stewart
not,
what
if
they
were
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
they're
no
were
--
were
no
criminal
court
--
juvenile
court?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
what
happened
to
him?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
gilinsky,
if
there
had
been
no
waiver
and
the
juvenile
court
had
determined
what
the
jury
of
the
district
court
did
eventually
determine,
i.e.
that
this
--
that
this
man
is
insane.
what
could
the
juvenile
court
have
done
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
civilly
committed?
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
and
i'm
quoting,
“the
counsel
apparently
did
not
press
the
matter
of
a
personal
interview
with
the
juvenile
court
judge,”
is
that
an
accurate
characterization
of
defense?
