justice

mr.
gilinsky,
is
there
removable
--
is
there
removal
of
order
or
waiver
by
the
juvenile
court
to
review
them
in
the
sense
that
is
it
possible
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
district
court
or
the
appellate
court
to
which
set
aside
the
waiver
of
jurisdiction
under
the
district
of
columbia
law?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
involved
here
because
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
--
excuse
me,
what
is
the
government's
position?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
see
if
i
can
relate
to
your
points,
excuse
me.
let
me
see
if
i
can
make
my
point
and
get
your
view
on
it.
is
there
any
right
whatever
the
procedure
might
be
as
you
understand
the
law,
whatever
form
the
attack
might
be
made,
is
there
any
right
on
behalf
of
a
defendant,
the
juvenile
whereas
a
juvenile
--
to
insist
that
he
be
tried
as
a
juvenile
and
not
be
tried
as
an
adult
or
is
the
determination
of
the
juvenile
court
to
waive
jurisdiction
followed
by
the
refusal
of
the
district
court
to
constitute
itself
a
juvenile
court
for
purposes
of
that
trial,
is
that
final
and
beyond
attack?
i
want
to
state
it
again
because
i
have
appreciated
very
much
your
views.
is
there
any
right
on
behalf
of
a
juvenile
to
insist
that
he'd
be
tried
as
a
juvenile
rather
than
an
adult
offender?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
but
when
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
gilinsky,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
the
following
question
on
that.
the
concurring
opinion
of
judge
washington
states
that
it
is
a
fair
inference
from
the
record
before
us,
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
juvenile
court
waive
jurisdiction
was
because
appellant
was
seriously
disturbed
and
the
juvenile
court
lack
facilities
adequately
to
treat
him,
do
you
remember
that?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
i
beg
your
pardon.
my
question
is
whether
the
government's
opinion
that
would
be
illegally
proper
consideration.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
mr.
gilinsky
but
will
you
please
come
in
on
this.
as
i
gather
from
your
previous
statements,
the
statute
provides
a
right
and
the
right
being
that
a
juvenile
is
entitled
to
be
tried
before
the
juvenile
court.
now,
that
right
can
be
overcome
if
after
full
investigation
and
subject
to
the
review
by
the
district
judge
or
in
the
statute,
the
juvenile
court
waives
jurisdiction,
am
i
right
this
far?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now,
if
the
juvenile
court
waives
jurisdiction,
let
us
suppose
it
waives
jurisdiction
solely
because
there
are
no
adequate
facilities
to
treat
a
mentally
disturbed
juvenile
and
your
opinion
is
that
a
lawful
waiver
or
lawful
basis
of
labor,
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
or
in
the
laws
that
specifies
that
as
an
appropriate
basis
for
waiver
of
jurisdiction?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
don't
--
i
agree
to
that,
i'm
asking
you
whether
government's
position
that
this
particular
criterion
is
a
legally
proper
criterion
upon
which
the
juvenile
court
can
act
and
that's
involved
in
this
case
as
i
read
it.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
gilinsky,
may
i
briefly
ask
you
--
can
i
ask
you
a
very
brief
question
about
another
face
of
this
matter.
as
i
understand
the
fingerprints
taken
from
this
man
when
he
was
14-year-old
boy
in
1961.
he
was
apprehended
for
some
offense,
his
fingerprints
were
taken
and
at
the
trial
in
the
district
court
here
as
i
understand
it,
expert
witnesses
testified
that
those
fingerprints
matched
the
fingerprints
found
in
the
victim's
apartments.
so
that
what
you
have
here,
as
i
understand,
is
the
use
of
fingerprints
taken
from
a
juvenile,
that's
number
one
at
a
subsequent
trial
in
the
district
court.
number
two,
i
get
the
impression
that
the
question
and
answer
for
such
as
to
convey
the
information
to
a
jury
that
the
--
this
man
had
been
convicted
in
effect
have
been
found
by
the
juvenile
court
to
have
committed
the
offense,
and
my
question
to
you
is
this,
assuming
that
that
objection
have
been
made
and
that
this
testimony
had
been
admitted
over
objection
at
the
trial
in
the
district
court,
do
you
concede
that
that
would've
been
reversible
error
or
is
it
your
position
that
it
would
not
have
been?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
that's
not
what
i'm
talking
about.
i'm
talking
about
page
42
of
your
brief,
the
top.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
wrote
it,
i
didn't.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
we'll
take
the
transcript
but
that
is
not
what
is
stated
in
your
brief
that
page
42
says,
you
say
that
expert
witnesses
testified
that
the
impressions
found
at
the
victim's
apartments
matched
those
taken
after
petitioner's
1961
arrest.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me,
mr.
arens,
was
there
--
i've
forgotten.
was
there
a
hearing
or
argument
before
the
transfer
order
was
entered?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
arens,
excuse
me.
on
page
5
of
your
brief,
you
refer
to
the
protracted
incommunicado
interrogation
by
police,
i
--
that
was
before
the
waiver
order
was
entered.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
that?
justice
abe
fortas
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
this?
justice
abe
fortas
yes
you
mean
--
is
there
--
did
you
endeavor
to
prove
up
this
point
in
the
district
court
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
if
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
were
you
the
trial
counsel
in
the
district
court?
justice
abe
fortas
but
there's
nothing
in
the
printed
or
type
--
there's
nothing
in
the
typewritten
record
before
us
that
would
substantiate
the
statement?
