mr.
richard
arens
i
would
argue
in
rebuttal,
if
it
please
--
mr.
richard
arens
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
provides
tragic
illustration
of
the
consequences
of
one-sided
secret
inquisitorial
determinations
of
fact
--
mr.
richard
arens
that's
a
good
one.
mr.
richard
arens
i
will.
mr.
richard
arens
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
mr.
john
locke
who
remarked,
“he
who
judges
without
acquainting
himself
to
the
utmost
that
he
is
capable,
cannot
acquit
himself
of
judging
amiss.”
mr.
richard
arens
this
--
“he
who
judges
without
acquainting
himself
to
the
utmost
that
he
is
capable
cannot
acquit
himself
of
judging
amiss.”
i
believe
the
statement
is
attributable
to
john
locke
are
no
fond
to
dissenters.
i
believe
this
case
is
replete
of
instances
in
which
judgment
after
judgment
was
handed
down
concerning
an
adolescent
boy,
founded
upon
inadequate
information.
i
ask
plea
to
reconstruct
the
facts
as
briefly
as
possible
within
the
juvenile
court
setting.
two
major
motions
were
filed.
one
objecting
to
continue
with
police
interrogation
of
petitioner,
the
second
asking
for
his
hospitalization
to
determine
his
mental
state
for
a
hearing
at
which
it
was
offered
to
prove
that
the
petitioner
was
amenable
to
the
treatment
resources
available
to
the
juvenile
court
and
that
he
would
respond
to
them
within
the
jurisdictional
time
span
available
to
the
court
and
to
petitioner.
mr.
richard
arens
before
he
reach
21.
we
offered
significantly
and
specifically
to
comply
with
the
criteria
contained
in
policy
memorandum
number
7,
then
in
effect
in
the
juvenile
court
in
which
the
suitability
of
the
juvenile
court
for
treatment
was
one
of
the
standards
decisive
of
the
determination
as
to
whether
waiver
was
or
was
not
to
take
place.
our
psychiatrists
who
have
briefly
examined
the
individual
petitioner
had
formed
but
a
tentative
opinion.
this
opinion
was
to
be
sure
transmitted
to
the
juvenile
court.
it
was
to
the
effect
that
the
petitioner
was
suffering
from
a
severe
form
of
mental
disorder,
the
exact
nature
of
which
could
not
be
defined
or
described
without
further
studies,
that
hospitalization
was
essential
to
provide
further
information
on
that,
that
the
psychiatrists'
preliminary
impression
was
that
the
juvenile
in
question
might
be
amenable
to
treatment
under
juvenile
court
hospices
but
that
further
studies
were
necessary
to
pinpoint
that
particular
allegation.
that
psychiatrist
in
fact
offered
to
recommend
a
treatment
situation
to
the
juvenile
court.
all
of
these
offers,
your
honors
please,
were
spurned
at
no
time
was
the
psychiatrist
heard
by
the
juvenile
court;
at
no
time
was
further
information
sought
from
government's
psychiatrist
in
a
hospital
which
routinely
receives
juveniles
for
a
study
in
the
district
of
columbia;
at
no
time
was
counsel
heard
formally
or
informally
in
chambers
or
in
court.
seven
days
after
his
arrest
and
without
benefit
of
any
arraignment
or
appearance
before
a
judicial
officer
which
would
have
been
a
short
term
and
as
a
matter
of
right
had
he
been
an
adult.
morris
allen
kent
jr.
was
transferred
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
to
stand
to
trial
under
the
adult
procedures
of
the
district
court
by
an
order
which
provided
no
comments,
no
explanation,
no
statement
of
reasons
whatsoever.
in
the
district
court,
there
was
no
hearing
of
any
kind
--
mr.
richard
arens
there
was
no
argument
in
the
juvenile
court,
mr.
justice
fortas,
any
nature
whatsoever.
the
papers
were
left
unanswered.
even
the
government
did
not
receive
an
opportunity
to
file
response
of
pleadings
in
this
case.
now,
may
i
add,
if
your
honor
please,
that
what
might
conceivably
have
been
remedied
under
statute
in
the
district
court
was
left
on
remedy.
there
was
no
hearing
on
the
district
court
upon
the
basis
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
setting
forth
the
significant
deficiencies
within
the
juvenile
court
procedure
followed
in
the
instant
case.
we
have
set
forth
in
the
motion
accompanied
by
uncontraverted
affidavits
that
defendant
at
that
particular
time
had
been
mentally
ill
that
his
mental
illness
had
been
neglected
by
juvenile
court
authorities,
that
no
inquiry
concerning
the
nature
of
this
mental
illness
was
made
at
the
time
the
matter
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
juvenile
court.
the
juvenile
court
could
not
know
what
the
state
to
this
particular
individual
was,
that
vital
social
records
relied
upon
by
the
juvenile
court
in
the
action
of
waiver
were
denied
to
counsel
who
as
consequence
did
not
know
what
to
explain,
supply,
or
refuse.
when
this
of
course
--
mr.
richard
arens
that
is
completely
correct,
your
honor.
the
social
record
in
the
juvenile
court
was
handed
to
the
counsel
at
the
district
court
hearing,
if
it
be
called
a
hearing,
in
which
no
evidence
was
taken,
in
which
offer
of
evidence
concerning
former
counsel,
relatives,
and
psychiatrists
was
spurned
in
which
no
inquiry
was
made
as
to
whether
this
particular
individual
--
mr.
richard
arens
he
asked
for
a
hearing
at
which
he
would
have
substantiated
the
allegations
contained
in
the
uncontraverted
motion
--
mr.
richard
arens
--
in
the
affidavit.
mr.
richard
arens
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
he
asked
for
a
hearing
in
which
the
testimony
of
specific
people
was
offered.
he
mentioned
former
counsel,
he
mentioned
relatives,
i
believe,
he
mentioned
doctors
as
well.
the
district
court
did
not
pause
to
conduct
a
hearing.
at
the
same
time,
it
did
not
proceed
in
such
haste
as
not
to
note
that
private
psychiatrist
have
been
secured
to
an
otherwise
indigent
defendant
and
that
this
involved
the
situation
in
which
it,
meaning
the
district
court,
and
i
quote
from
the
transcript
to
the
district
court
had
a
suspicion
that
this
presumably
be
unfair
to
the
case
of
psychiatric
experts
outside
the
ranks
of
the
public
hospitals
was
stimulated
activity
and
the
judge
was
concerned
about
the
activities
of
the
national
institute
of
health
and
if
that
was
so,
somebody
was
going
to
get
in
serious
trouble.
and
the
judge
thereupon
directed
trial
counsel
on
the
eve
of
trial
to
advice
him
fully
as
to
the
nature
of
the
psychiatric
expertise
made
available
to
the
defendant.
and
defense
counsel
proceeded
under
the
poll
of
intermissions
of
legal
impropriety
in
the
defense
of
a
capital
case.
the
matter
can
be
summed
up
very
briefly.
the
juvenile
court
waiver
was
based
upon
secret
evidence.
the
petitioner
demanded
but
did
not
secure
social
records,
a
determinative
factor
in
the
waiver
which
he
had
a
right
to
see
under
district
of
columbia
statutory
law.
mr.
richard
arens
i
believe
that
the
question
concerning
his
mental
competency
should
have
been
determined.
certainly,
we
have
prima
facie
evidence
of
mental
unsoundness.
mr.
richard
arens
it
might
well
have
been
an
informal,
in
camera
hearing
at
which
counsel
would've
had
an
opportunity
to
explain
--
mr.
richard
arens
it
is
conceivable
although
i
do
not
propose
during
the
--
mr.
richard
arens
in
this
particular
case,
i
wanted
an
opportunity
of
determining
whether
these
social
records
of
juvenile
court
were
in
fact
clear
as
to
lack
of
mental
illness
on
the
part
of
petitioner.
it
has
been
suggested
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
concurring
opinion
by
judge
washington
that
the
logical
inference
was
the
juvenile
court
was
well
apprised
of
petitioner's
rapidly
deteriorating
mental
state.
mr.
richard
arens
i
believe
mr.
justice
white,
the
situation
may
arise
and
this
was
such
a
situation
in
which
an
evidentiary
hearing
concerning
the
petitioner's
mental
state
was
indeed
in
order.
mr.
richard
arens
the
government
of
course
would
be
in
a
perfect
position
represented
by
corporation
counsel
to
challenge
allegations
of
the
lack
of
competency
of
this
defendant
to
participate
in
the
waiver
proceedings
in
which
by
judgment
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
he
is
in
fact
in
type
of
the
counsel
yet
how
can
counsel
meaningfully
maintain
contact
with
someone
who
is
in
fact
incompetent.
mr.
richard
arens
it
should've
been
directed
to
determine
on
the
basis
--
the
uncontraverted
allegations
of
this
particular
case.
mr.
richard
arens
mr.
justice
white,
--
mr.
richard
arens
--
the
first
question
of
course
is
to
whether
or
not
the
juvenile
court
did
waive
properly,
could
the
district
court
applied
jurisdiction
in
the
absence
of
a
proper
waiver
since
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
children
put
in
that
particular
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
arens
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
believe
you
supplied
--
you
had
a
further
reason
for
a
hearing
which
i
believe
--
mr.
richard
arens
i
believe
this
is
certainly
a
valid
end
of
a
hearing
in
the
district
court.
i
do
not
believe
that
it's
the
only
valid
end
because
if
the
juvenile
court
has
not
properly
divested
itself
a
jurisdiction,
i
do
not
believe
the
district
court
could
probably
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
arens
that
--
mr.
richard
arens
you
would
--
mr.
richard
arens
well,
that
is
my
contention,
mr.
justice
white.
there
was
no
valid
waiver
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
arens
no,
i
believe
given
the
valid
waiver,
the
district
court
has
a
new
opportunity
of
rectifying
existing
substantive
as
distinct
from
procedural
or
jurisdictional
error.
it
may
assume
jurisdiction
--
mr.
richard
arens
i
would
distinguish
between
a
substantive
error
which
is
subject
to
correction
and
the
fundamental
procedural
error
which
deprive
the
juvenile
court
of
any
authority
whatsoever
to
transfer
--
mr.
richard
arens
i
should've
been
here,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
arens
i
don't
know
whether
i
would
have
been,
but
i
should've
been.
my
moral
duty
would
have
been
to
insist
upon
the
jurisdictional
invalidity
of
all
district
court
proceedings
given
the
invalidity
in
the
juvenile
court
below.
mr.
richard
arens
i
rely
upon
the
fact,
if
your
honor
please,
the
juvenile
court
did
not
disclose
the
social
records.
and
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
it
is
required
to
do
such
for
all
interested
persons,
a
person
is
legitimately
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
child.
is
it
farfetched
to
assume
that
the
lawyer
representing
a
child
has
this
legitimate
interest
even
though
he'd
not
be
mentioned
by
name
in
the
legislature
and
the
legislative
history
upon
the
subject
that
we
have
alluded
to
in
our
brief
is
what
clear,
cut,
and
explicit.
mr.
richard
arens
the
statute
directs
the
disclosure
of
the
social
records
to
all
persons
legitimately
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
child
and
i
submit,
if
your
honor
please,
that
the
boy's
lawyer
was
precisely
such
a
person.
mr.
richard
arens
i
have
no
way
telling
your
honor.
all
i
can
say
is
that
a
motion
was
properly
filed
from
disclosure
of
these
records.
mr.
richard
arens
i
was
informed
of
it
--
mr.
richard
arens
--
apprised
by
court
officials
and
this
is
without
precedence.
i
cannot
ask
for
their
authority
in
making
these
particular
statements
nor
can
i
made
authority
of
representations
to
this
court
as
to
what
usual
juvenile
court
practice
is
or
although
it
is
my
impression
that
social
service
records
are
generally
regarded
this
confidential
and
immune
from
the
scrutiny
of
trying
lawyers.
they
are
secret
evidence
and
they
were,
if
your
honor
please,
secret
evidence
upon
which
the
fate
of
this
child
determined
and
--
mr.
richard
arens
mr.
justice
fortas,
if
you
want
i'll
make
one
moment.
i
will
comply
with
your
request
for
me
to
rely
into
this.
yes,
it's
referred
to
on
page
4,
d.c.
code
in
section
11-929
(b)
as
it
was
cited
at
that
time.
a
revised
section
substantially
identical,
said
the
records
made
by
officers
of
this
court
referred
to
social
records
shall
be
withheld
from
indiscriminate
public
inspection
except
that
such
records
shall
be
made
available,
shall
be
made
available
by
rule
of
order,
special
order
for
such
person
et
cetera
who
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
the
protection,
welfare,
treatment
and
rehabilitation
of
the
child.
i
appreciate
the
court's
comment.
mr.
richard
arens
yes
your
honor,
i
believe
in
black
decided
on
december
8,
the
afternoon
before
this
court
has
scheduled
argument
in
this
case
the
first
time,
the
suggestion
was
at
least
strongly
made
that
counsel
on
waiver
proceedings
is
entitled
to
peruse
the
social
records
of
his
client.
mr.
richard
arens
i
regret
to
say
it
is
still
unreported
but
available
in
slip
sheet
form
and
i
most
certainly
will
comply
with
your
wishes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
arens
yes.
finally,
it
is
clear
that
--
mr.
richard
arens
i'm
implying
the
statement,
if
your
honor
please,
an
affidavit
form
saying
that
i
have
inquired
as
to
whether
interview
with
the
juvenile
court
would
be
useful.
i
was
told
by
the
social
service
director
according
to
the
affidavit
which
is
far
to
the
record
of
this
case
that
it
was
doubtful
if
it
could
be
arranged
than
it
would
probably
serve
no
useful
purpose.
the
impression
which
i
gleaned
and
which
i
set
forth
in
the
affidavit
was
that
i
was
wasting
my
time
in
addressing
myself
to
stopping
the
waiver
which
appeared
to
be
appending
in
this
particular
case.
i
submit
too
that
unconstitutional,
as
well
as
statutory
grounds,
there
was
no
effective
assistance
of
counsel
on
the
juvenile
court
level
or
whatsoever.
clearly,
the
petitioner
is
16-year-old
child
and
an
admitted
victim
of
mental
illness
was
without
counsel
when
questioned
by
the
police.
clearly,
since
the
juvenile
court
relied
on
its
social
records
which
were
unavailable
to
counsel
it
is
clear
that
counsel
was
no
more
affective
in
urging
countervailing
consideration
than
he
would
have
been
had
he
presented
an
argument
to
a
jury
in
the
course
of
the
trial
in
which
he
had
not
been
an
attendance
at
the
time
of
taking
the
testimony.
this
is
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
i
do
not
believe
effective
assistance
of
counsel
can
be
rendered
under
these
circumstances.
and
as
a
matter,
it's
not
whether
the
determination
of
effective
assistance
counsel
within
this
setting
be
constitutional
or
statutory,
though
i
strongly
submit
that
the
constitutional
dictate
of
fundamental
fairness
urges
the
recognition
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel
in
a
critical
stage,
the
most
critical
stage
of
the
juvenile
court
proceeding.
chief
judge
bazelon
referred
to
the
most
awesome
decision
confronting
the
juvenile
court,
the
decision
of
waiver,
the
a
critically
important
act
for
the
child
who
may
be
abandoned
as
'incorrigible'
and
for
the
society
which
had
thus
--
mr.
richard
arens
that,
your
honor,
is
in
watkins.
mr.
richard
arens
no
your
honor,
i
do
not
leave
this
language
is
on
the
de
novo
bench.
mr.
richard
arens
i
believe
that
the
statutory
right
to
trial
by
juvenile,
having
been
secured,
it
cannot
be
arbitrarily,
capriciously
or
erratically
removed
from
that
child
certainly
not
under
the
circumstances
outlined
in
this
case.
i
would
finally
point
to
the
failure
to
fulfill
the
statutory
requirement
prerequisite
to
waiver.
could
there
be
a
full
investigation
in
which
there
was
no
knowledge
as
to
the
exact
mental
stage
of
the
boy
who
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
entitled
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
i
do
not
believe
it's
possible,
the
juvenile
court
with
knowledge
of
a
schizophrenic
mental
condition
have
directed
the
removal
of
that
boy
from
the
shelter
of
a
juvenile
receiving
home
into
the
company
of
adult
criminals.
and
i
believe
the
most
plausible
inference
is
the
juvenile
court
had
no
knowledge
of
the
severely
deteriorating
mental
state
of
the
petitioner,
who
was
subjected
to
the
awesome
experience
of
trial
as
an
adult
under
the
circumstances
which
have
been
outlined
by
this
section.
mr.
richard
arens
that's
right.
mr.
richard
arens
your
honor,
i
asserted
that
i
have
been
informed
that
the
boy
was
interrogated
incommunicado
during
the
first
two
days
of
his
detention,
i
assume
not
what
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
arens
yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
there
is
my
affidavit.
i
demanded
to
see
my
client
in
juvenile
court.
i
was
told
i
could
find
him
at
the
juvenile
receiving
home.
i
was
offered
a
brochure
as
to
how
to
reach
the
juvenile
receiving
home.
when
i
reached
the
juvenile
receiving
home,
i
was
informed
that
my
client
was
undergoing
a
second
day
of
interrogation
at
metropolitan
police
headquarters.
mr.
richard
arens
your
honor
this
particular
point,
if
my
recollection
is
correct
and
i
rely
upon
an
unprinted
record
and
the
recollection
which
may
be
fallible.
this
particular
point
was
relied
upon
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
in
the
accompanying
affidavits.
mr.
richard
arens
and
i
ask
plea
to
correct
myself
because
it
has
been
the
long
time
since
these
records
have
been
listed
on
for
peruse,
but
this
is
my
recollection.
mr.
richard
arens
no,
your
honor,
i
was
not
the
trial
counsel
in
the
district
court.
mr.
richard
arens
no,
your
honor
there
is
only
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
which
are
filed
in
the
district
court
with
accompanying
affidavits
which
i
believe
have
been
totally
uncontraverted.
mr.
richard
arens
it
was
counsel's
judgment
that
this
case
was
best
heard
in
terms
of
constitutional
perspective
by
the
highest
court
of
the
land,
in
a
matter
which
was
totally
without
impression
and
which
have
not
yet
been
decided
authoritatively
by
any
influential
tribunal.
mr.
richard
arens
i
regret
to
say
i
have
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
arens
i
believe
this
would
be
constitutional
and
satisfactory.
many
of
the
rights
urged
upon
the
supreme
court
is
properly
belonging
to
the
petitioner
have
seen
vindication
at
the
hands
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
other
cases
since
the
decision
in
the
kent
case.
the
court
of
appeals
has
declared
lawyers
to
be
entitled
to
seeing
relevant
record
within
the
possession
of
the
social
workers
of
the
juvenile
court.
lawyers
have
been
declared
entitled
to
be
present
and
children
have
been
declared
entitled
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel
in
the
black
decision.
we
ask
for
the
declaration
by
this
court
that
a
child
has
a
constitutional
right
of
assistance
of
counsel
in
juvenile
court
proceedings
encompassing
waiver
and
including
the
right
to
the
inspection
of
juvenile
court
social
records
which
form
a
significant
basis
of
the
decision
of
waiver
by
the
juvenile
court.
we
ask
in
sum,
the
court
declare
the
children
as
well
as
adults
are
entitled
to
certain
unalienable
rights
within
juvenile
court
proceedings.
