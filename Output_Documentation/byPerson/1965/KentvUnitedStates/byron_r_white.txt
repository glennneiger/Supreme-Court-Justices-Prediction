justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
--
let's
assume
prevail
here,
but
only
on
the
--
on
your
theory,
your
right
to
a
hearing
matter
prior
to
waiver
and
this
would
only
mean
that
you
would
have
to
have
that
--
there
would
be
a
hearing
as
to
whether
there
would
be
a
waiver
and
that
you
were
granted
a
hearing
and
you
didn't
prevail
in
the
hearing
there
would
still
might
be
a
waiver
in
a
retrial.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
right,
there
might
or
there
might
not
be
but
at
least
at
that
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
--
do
you
think
the
juvenile
court
mistakenly
waives
and
before
the
error
can
be
corrected,
that
he
becomes
21,
he's
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
either
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ehrlich
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
when
you
move
to
dismiss
and
also
move
the
court,
the
district
court
to
sit
as
a
juvenile
court,
you
said
there
was
a
hearing
but
what
was
the
content
and
the
issues
in
that
hearing,
were
you
permitted
to
--
were
you
permitted
to
present
evidence
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
asked
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
while
ago
you
said
there
was
a
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
and
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
juvenile
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
you
permitted
to
argue
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
of
motion
did
you
file?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
was
it
just
a
pro
forma
motion,
i
mean,
did
you
--
what's
the
practice
do
you
--
do
you
submit
materials
with
your
motion
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
affidavits?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
presented
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
judge
examined?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
he
have
the
material
before
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
he
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
got
it,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see,
what
was
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
were
the
judges
in
this
panel?
justice
byron
r.
white
from
whom
does
the
judge
get
advice
on
the
--
these
waiver
matters?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
were
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
probation
officer
or
lawyer
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
lawyers
on
the
staff
or
juvenile
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
social
workers?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
know
who
gives
them
advice
on
waiver
matters,
anyone
of
them
or
all
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
waiver
matters?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what
do
you
--
why
is
that
do
you
say
that
the
lawyer
for
a
juvenile
offender
isn't
entitled
to
see
the
social
file
--
the
social
files?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
any
more
than
a
social
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
social
workers
have
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
not
the
juvenile
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
this
request
for
the
social
worker
has
ever
actually
reached
the
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
one
it
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
still
haven't
got
a
blue
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
we
find
this
hearing,
this
one,
what
was
the
page
and
period?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
of
the
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
court
said
specifically
here,
he
wasn't
about
go
behind
the
juvenile
courts
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
full
investigation
at
the
end
of
the
file
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
just
the
same
and
said
that
once
the
juvenile
court
makes
that
decision,
i'm
not
going
to
second
guess
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
going
behind
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
with
references
to
testimony.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
something?
i
think
mr.
justice
fortas
really
asked
you
this,
does
district
court
have
the
power
or
the
contrary
of
the
statute
if
the
district
court
says,
“yes,
there
was
a
full
investigation.
but
here
are
the
facts
that
were
out
the
same
facts
the
juvenile
court
judge
did
and
i
just
disagree
with
them.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
the
district
court
exercise
any
such
power
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
arens,
what
kind
of
a
hearing
would
you
suggest
that
they
had
in
the
district
court,
in
the
juvenile
court
before
the
waiver?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
--
i'm
not
talking
about
the
issue,
what
kind
of
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
the
face
--
the
face
to
face
meeting
with
the
judge
and
an
opportunity
to
say
what
you
wanted
to
say
if
that
satisfy
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
did
you
want
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there
should
be
an
evidentiary
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
would
the
--
if
this
would
be
a
full
adversary
hearing,
then
and
who
was
on
the
other
side?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
--
in
the
district
court,
when
you
make
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
a
motion
for
the
district
court
to
act
as
a
juvenile
court,
what
rules
should
the
district
court
follow?
let's
assume
that
there
is
a
hearing,
all
the
hearing
you
won,
what
should'
it
be
directed
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
to
be
determined
whether
the
--
just
whether
the
juvenile
court
went
to
the
right
procedures
or
whether
or
not
the
juvenile
court
was
right
on
the
merits
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
never
--
the
district
court
would
never
sit
as
a
juvenile
court
if
what
you
say
is
true
because
it
reviewed
--
if
it
reviews
the
wavier
and
found
it
invalid
or
improper,
there
would've
been
a
valid
waiver
and
automatically,
no
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
on
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
read
that
provision
under
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
if
there
wasn't
--
if
there
wasn't
a
proper
waiver,
that
if
the
juvenile
court
judge
made
the
wrong
decision
on
the
waiver,
there
wasn't
a
proper
waiver
and
the
district
court
never
acquired
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
statute
certainly
doesn't
prevent
the
district
--
the
juvenile
judge
from
letting
the
lawyer
see
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
is
it
--
did
the
district
court
ever
get
to
juvenile
judge
view
of
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
any
one
ever
said
he
was
precluded
to
see
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
who?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
going
to
leave
--
i
hope
you
leave
a
copy
of
that
recent
decision.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
