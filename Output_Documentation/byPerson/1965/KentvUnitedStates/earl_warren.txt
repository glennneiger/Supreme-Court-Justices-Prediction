mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ehrlich,
may
i
interrupt
to
ask,
where
were
these
motions
made,
were
they
made
in
the
juvenile
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
they
were.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ehrlich,
may
i
interrupt
you
to
ask
when
were
the
dates
of
the
alleged
rapes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
with
reference
to
the
dates
of
the
burglaries
and
robberies
that
he
has
committed,
were
they
in
the
middle
of
them
or
around
that
part?
chief
justice
earl
warren
altogether?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gilinsky
--
or
mr.
arens,
do
you
propose
to
argue
now
or
in
rebuttal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
rebuttal.
mr.
gilinsky.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
investigation
did
the
juvenile
court
make
before
denying
these
orders?
chief
justice
earl
warren
criminal
court,
i
mean.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
13
or
14
years
old?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
are
the
reasons?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
the
judge
acts
on
hearsay
but
doesn't
give
any
chance
to
rebut
the
hearsay.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
he
feel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
always?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
he
we're
suppose
to
take
judicial
notice
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
are
we
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
we
left
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
procedure
authorized
for
doing
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
district
court
has
that
power
to
second
guess
the
juvenile
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
it
be
the
exclusive
factor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
it
was,
that's
why
i
asked
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
they
say
about
his
competency
at
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
say
may
have
or
did?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
couldn't
the
juvenile
court
have
continued
his
probation
after
a
commitment
to
the
st.
elizabeths,
let's
say
to
the
general
hospital
and
held
him
and
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
during
his
entire
juvenile
status?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
wouldn't
that
be
satisfactory
here?
did
they
want
--
do
they
insist
on
this
young
man
going
there
for
life
for
wanting
to
be
able
to
take
care
of
him
and
keep
in
some
kind
of
an
institution
for
life?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
not
what
i'm
talking
about.
i
thought
there
was
a
mental
problem,
why
couldn't
he
have
continued
him
on
probation
as
long
as
he
was
in
the
mental
hospital.
if
he
wasn't
in
the
mental
hospital,
then
he
could
find
some
other
disposition
of
the
case,
but
if
he
was
mentally
ill
as
all
these
doctors
indicated,
why
couldn't
the
judge
have
taken
care
of
it
in
that
manner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
asking
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i'm
asking
just
precisely
what
i
said,
could
not
the
judge
in
the
juvenile
court
have
kept
him
on
probation
provided
he
was
restrained
during
his
mental
illness
in
one
of
the
hospitals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
that's
what
i
ask
you,
was
everybody
in
this
case
determined
that
this
young
man
should
be
sent
away
for
the
rest
of
his
natural
life,
is
that
why
he
got
90
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
equivalent
of
two
life
terms?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
tried
to
explain
it
very
--
very
meticulously
why
the
judge
probably
did
this,
why
do
you
say
now
you
can't?
chief
justice
earl
warren
minimum?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
don't
talk
about
the
defense
counsel.
what
was
the
sentence
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
of
course.
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
the
minimum
is
30
and
the
maximum
of
90?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
minimum
and
maximum
for
a
life
term?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
federal
system,
that's
what
we're
dealing
with.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
i
asked
you
what
is
the
minimum
and
maximum
on
a
life
sentence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
know.
but
isn't
there
some
time
a
minimum
at
which
they
can
ask
for
parole,
can
they
ask
for
parole
the
next
day
after
they
agree
on
a
life
imprisonment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
earliest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
i
didn't
know.
may
i
ask
you
this
mr.
gilinsky?
is
the
juvenile,
before
the
juvenile
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
entitled
to
a
lawyer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
if
he
is,
what
is
his
lawyer
entitled
to
do
for
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
as
i
understood
mr.
ehrlich,
mr.
arens
made
two
motions
that
were
very
vital
to
this
defendant
in
the
juvenile
court
and
that
neither
of
them
were
ever
passed
upon
by
the
juvenile
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
is
that
giving
a
man
the
right
to
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
he
made
affidavits.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
affidavits
were
attached
to
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
no
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
and
both
of
them
didn't
apply
to
that
though.
he
asked
for
certain
--
he
asked
for
certain
documents,
as
i
understand
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
somewhat
--
alright
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understand
mr.
ehrlich,
the
judge
never
responded
to
those
two
motions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
was
nothing
--
there
were
no
response
made
to
it
and
no
action
taken.
but
now,
i
asked
you,
is
that
giving
a
man
a
right
to
counsel
if
you
say
he
can
make
motions
but
the
judge
doesn't
have
to
decide
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
means
that
in
those
circumstances,
the
lawyer
has
no
right
to
appear
before
the
juvenile
court,
has
no
right
to
make
any
motions
in
favor
of
his
client
and
has
no
right
to
have
them
decided?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
but
isn't
he
entitled
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
some
response?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
asked
you
that,
isn't
he
entitled
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
he
entitled
to
a
denial
of
it
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gilinsky,
it's
quite
apparent
from
some
of
the
colloquy
that
we're
going
to
have
some
difficulty
with
the
transcript
in
this
case
and
you
speak
of
some
documents,
counsel
speaks
of
others,
and
you
say
that
there
are
discrepancies
between
them.
i
wonder
if
you
and
counsel
for
the
petitioner
cannot
get
together
and
do
something
about
this
to
simplify
the
manner
for
us,
can
you
not
stipulate
this
what
we
should
consider
and
so
forth
and
in
what
connection?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
could
do
that
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
will
you
do
that
mr.
gilinsky?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
if
you
will
--
if
you
will
do
that,
then
supply
us
with
it
at
your
earliest
convenience
--
very
well.
mr.
arens.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
arens,
if
you
gather
--
it's
two
--
about
three
minutes
to
two,
if
you'd
rather
start
at
after
lunch,
you
may
do
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
want
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
we'll
return.
mr.
arens,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
