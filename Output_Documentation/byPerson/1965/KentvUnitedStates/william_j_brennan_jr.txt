justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
ehrlich,
i
gather
as
to
all
of
these
on
this
issue,
could
you
suggest
that
there's
no
imperfection
in
the
record
in
the
sense
that
these
claims
were
not
timely
raised?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
were?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
said
earlier
that
we
have
to
search
the
record
for
plain
error,
you're
speaking
only
the
criminal
trial
itself
or
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
because
i
gather
that
if
you
prevailed
on
the
point
you're
now
arguing,
you're
asking
not
merely
a
reversal
of
the
conviction,
but
that
the
conviction
that
he'd
not
be
possibly
retried?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
only
if
you
fail
on
this
that
you're
asking
for
a
retrial
on
the
points
that
you
say
were
not
raised
at
trial,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
i'm
not
--
rather
that
motion
to
dismiss,
you
mean
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
made
on
these
grounds
in
the
trial
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
--
by
that
i
mean
in
the
trial
of
this
criminal
charge
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
were
they
preserved
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
that
regard
at
least
--
or
are
you
saying
that
proper
objection
was
made
to
those
issues
at
least
as
to
this
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
those
properly
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
only
the
issues
related
to
what?
the
psychiatric
testimony?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
neither
of
those
was
raised?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
the
motion
before
is
a
different
judge
from
the
trial
judge,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
tried
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
have
the
number.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
do
you
think
this
--
that
those
panels
currently
have
their
conclusions
on
statutory
interpretations
on
constitutional
grounds
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
sounds
that
this
is
placed
in
the
interpretation
of
(inaudible)
implicit
or
not
implicit
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
the
scheme?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
read
that
as
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
statutory?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
other
title
is
a
condition
viewed
as
statutory?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
give
us
a
conflict
some
time,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
isn't
anything
in
a
way
of
supervisory
powers
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
those
are
constitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
statute
tell
what
not
to
investigate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

problem
is
here
of
what
investigation
means?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whether
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
i
understand
it
to
--
always
correctly
and
apparently
those
panels
in
the
court
of
appeals
seem
to
put
a
different
content
into
the
requirement
for
investigation,
don't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
what
does
the
lawyer
doing
--
that
have
anything
to
do
with
it?
justice
william

we

you
mean
they
make
it

affirmatively

do
we
have
to

them
both?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
now
whose
investigation
is
the
district
judge
talking
about
when
he
says,
“that's
not
going
to
prove
there
hasn't
been
a
full
investigation?”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whose
investigation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
i
would
suppose
the
statute
would
require
that
he
make
an
investigation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
gilinsky,
are
you
familiar
with
this
opinion
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
decided
december
20th,
state
versus
loray,
l-o-r-a-y?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
it's
not
in
your
brief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
reason
i
ask
is
that
i
wanted
to
--
if
there's
any
other
opinion
where
anything
like
--
this
appears
which
identical
case
with
this
one
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
which
it
was
held
that
the
failure
to
provide
a
hearing
and
counsel,
so
the
lower
court
held
at
least,
was
constitutional
effect
that's
required
the
setting
aside
of
the
subsequent
judgment
of
conviction,
has
anyone
else
to
your
knowledge
taken
the
view
or
expressed
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
this
is
a
constitutional
matter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
the
supreme
court
in
this
instance
found
that
it
didn't
have
to
decide
that
because
they
agreed
that
there
had
to
be
counsel
and
a
hearing
for
reasons
of
fundamental
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
fairness
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
didn't
reached
apparently
and
then
they
said
that
they
did
not
allow
the
--
as
i
read
this,
the
conviction
to
be
set
aside
but
require
a
new
referral
hearing
and
follow
the
jackson-denno
technique,
retaining
the
conviction
and
so
the
awaiting
of
the
outcome
of
the
new
referral
--
of
the
referral
hearing
that
was
ordered.
but
is
there
at
much
in
the
way
of
you
express
this
is
a
constitutional
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
problem?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
call
it
referral
here
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
i'm
away
10
years
from
that
but
they
never
thought
it
have
a
constitutional
basis
on
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
would
suppose
if
the
full
investigation
contemplates
provision
for
lawyer
and
a
hearing
that
that
can
be
--
that
--
i
was
frankly
what
i've
never
heard
of
black
in
full
that
you
just
mentioned
or
that
mr.
ehrlich
mentioned
it
that
that
certainly
strikes
me
as
a
reading
of
full
investigation
as
embodying
a
right
of
counsel
and
the
right
of
hearing.
you
don't
think
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
doesn't
say
it
constitutionally
but
as
a
matter
of
the
interpretation
of
full
investigation,
you
don't
think
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
start
to
say
that
new
jersey
is
the
only
one
where
they
couldn't
have?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
late
case
involved
a
murder
--
involved
a
murder
conviction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
does
this
mean,
if
those
stand,
mr.
gilinsky,
he
--
by
reason
of
the
findings
on
the
rape
counts
will
be
at
st.
elizabeths,
how
long?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
might
mean
for
life?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
meanwhile,
he's
getting
credit
on
the
sentences
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
the
time
he's
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
he
under
treatment
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
they
discharge
him
as
what
--
cured
to
whatever
it
may
be,
is
that
what
it
would
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
he
were
discharged.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
changing
it,
so
that
is
--
he
can
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
resentence?
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
discharge
him
in
a
parole
or
probation
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
required
the
sentencing
--
what
was
it?
30
to
90
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
each
fix
count.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
run
consecutively.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
before
he
gets
to
reach
21?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
it
that
you've
given
to
the
defense
counsel
in
the
district
court
which
mr.
gilinsky
referred
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
opportunity
did
the
defense
counsel
have
in
the
district
court
to
do
anything
with
file
that
was
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
make
any
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
application
directed
expressly
to
the
file?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
arens,
why
since
the
district
judge
might
constitute
itself
under
the
statute,
a
juvenile
court
judge,
why
would
not
the
reason
for
the
hearing
be
that
the
end
that
they're
be
determined
whether
in
fact
he
should
be
tried
as
a
juvenile
or
as
an
adult?
why
wouldn't
that
be
the
purpose
of
that
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
that.
let's
see.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
the
same
--
the
same
answer
with
mr.
justice
white
before
and
that
is
what
would
be
the
purpose,
this
is
the
new
idea
to
me,
i
must
say.
the
referral
court
being
able
to
constitute
itself
with
the
same
kind
of
court
as
the
referring
court
but
that's
what
our
statutory
scheme
is.
now,
if
the
hearing
in
the
juvenile
court,
for
the
first
instance,
was
the
only
to
the
end
that
they're
be
determined
whether
he
could
be
tried
as
a
juvenile
or
tried
as
an
adult,
why
would
not
that
be
also
the
end
of
a
hearing
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
must
say
you
leave
me
cold
with
that
argument
since
--
since
--
if
i
understand
the
statute,
the
district
judge
can
constitute
itself
as
a
juvenile
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
don't
see
that
--
then
you're
right
back
in
the
juvenile
court
for
a
practical
purposes
and
you
now
get
a
hearing
on
the
question
whether
or
not
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
the
charge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
in
fact
on
your
motion
to
dismiss
the
district
court
had
constituted
itself
a
juvenile
court
had
conducted
a
hearing
and
reached
the
conclusion
that
this
kent
was
to
be
tried
as
a
juvenile,
would
you
be
here?
and
they
tried
him
as
a
juvenile.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you'd
still
be
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
must
say
i
don't
think
you
have
to
go
that
far.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
in
black,
mr.
arens?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
watkins?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
read
that
as
a
constitutional
ground
or?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
arens,
may
i
ask
you,
have
you
seen
this
a
way
of
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
wonder
if
i
could
ask
you
this,
suppose
we
will
agree
with
you
that
there
should've
been
--
i'll
use
old
statement
on
this
waiver
language,
a
referral
hearing,
what
do
you
think
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
solution
which
is,
not
to
set
aside
this
criminal
conviction
but
rather
direct
a
new
referral
hearing
and
if
the
result
of
that
hearing
is
the
finding
that
waiver
was
proper
after
a
full
inquiry
and
then
the
conviction
stands.
this
is
unrelated
of
course
to
the
errors
that
are
urged
in
the
trial
itself.
