mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
may
it
please
the
court.
the
principal
question
which
we
feel
is
in
this
case
whether
constitutionally
it
was
necessary
to
hold
an
adversary
formal
oral
hearing
or
for
that
matter
any
kind
of
hearing
at
the
juvenile
court
level
under
the
particular
facts
to
decide
whether
the
social
service
facilities
of
the
juvenile
court
were
applicable
to
this
particular
defendant.
now,
the
government
contends
that
once
the
court,
the
juvenile
court
now,
had
completed
the
full
investigation
that
it
required
by
the
statute
and
once
the
court
had
taken
all
that
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
it
doesn't.
it
says
after
full
investigation.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
it
may
be
a
problem
in
certain
cases
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
because
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
let
me
first
direct
my
attention
to
this
point
about
the
conflict.
cases
called
black
as
he
said
was
handed
down
in
december,
as
i
read
the
case,
it
holds
that
a
juvenile,
in
juvenile
court
prior
to
waiver
is
entitled
to
a
lawyer.
it
does
not
decide
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing.
it
does
not
decide
that
he's
entitled
to
see
the
social
records.
and
for
very
good
reason,
because
this
boy,
black,
did
not
have
a
lawyer.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
because
that's
why
they
point
in
black
to
what
happened
in
kent.
they
say,
“now,
look
what
a
lawyer
can
do
for
you.”
in
kent,
the
lawyer
did
supply,
did
supply
the
juvenile
court
with
a
memorandum
and
some
information
as
to
his
mental
status.
so
that
--
to
say
that
the
lawyer
was
useless,
you
see,
black
says,
“no,
of
course
it
wasn't
useless.
look
at
kent.”
but
on
the
basis
of
that,
i
say
there
is
no
conflict
in
these
decisions
because
what
the
panel
was
saying
was
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
in
any
event,
i
do
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
there
is
none
in
--
it's
a
slip
opinion.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
december
8,
1965.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
it
was
immediately
prior
to
the
--
when
this
case
was
(voice
overlap).
it's
a
district
court.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
district
court,
of
the
juvenile
court--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
made
a
full
investigation,
your
honor.
let
me
start
in
the
beginning.
some
two
and
a
half
years
prior
to
this
time,
this
young
man
was
picked
up
for
four
house
breaking
charges,
at
that
time,
he
was
brought
before
the
juvenile
court,
at
that
time
he
had
a
lawyer,
and
at
that
time
a
full
investigation
was
made.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
there's
no
question
about
what
it
was.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
actually,
what
was
done
at
that
time
was
he
was
put
on
probation.
the
report
itself
though
is
in
this
record.
the
report
itself
is
in
this
record
and
what
it
shows
is
this,
it
shows
that
the
juvenile
court
had
before
it
information.
first,
as
to
the
background
of
this
boy,
where
he
came
from,
broken
home,
interview
with
the
mother,
why
the
social
service
person
at
that
time
thought
the
mother
was
not
able
to
give
enough
information,
and
why
the
social
service
went
to
the
aunts
and
other
people,
to
the
principal
of
the
school,
found
that
this
boy
had
an
average
intelligence,
101
iq.
it
lists
in
other
words,
this
report
lists
that's
two
and
a
half
years
before
it,
lists
a
number
of
things
which
were
investigated.
i
emphasize
that
he
had
a
lawyer
at
that
time
and
he
was
placed
on
probation,
he
was
asked
to,
as
i
recall,
to
return
the
property
and
make
restitution.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
he
was
14
years
of
age
at
that
time.
now,
some
two
and
a
half
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
don't
know.
no,
it
doesn't
show
what
he
saw
or
what
was
discussed.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
the
lawyer
does
not
usually
see
this
and
i
will
come
to
--
that's
an
issue
of
course
in
this
case
but
there
are
reasons
why
lawyer
does
not
always
see
this.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
there
are
number
of
reasons
because
first
of
all
the
part
of
this
information
of
course
is
hearsay,
it's
not
the
kind
of
information
which
is
developed.
it's
like
a
probation
report
on
sense.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
does
not
quite
accurate
in
this
case,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
the
--
what
happened
as
a
fact
in
this
case
is
that
mr.
arens,
the
day
after
the
boy
was
picked
up,
went
to
the
juvenile
court
and
saw
the
social
director
and
he
asked
to
see
the
judge
and
the
social
director
although
he's
not
saying
that
he
couldn't
see
the
judge.
he
said
that
he
didn't
--
most
likely
said
the
he
didn't
think
that
it
would
help
him.and
you
get
this
from
mr.
arens'
affidavits
that
are
in
the
file.
however,
there's
no
question
that
the
social
director
did
tell
mr.
arens
that
we
will
delay
the
waiver,
however,
in
order
to
allow
you
to
supply
whatever
information
you
think
the
judge
should
have.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
affidavits,
mr.
arens
says
that
he
did
supply
the
juvenile
court
with
a
memorandum
and
with
a
letter
for
whatever
kind
of
report
it
was
from
a
doctor
who
had
examined
the
boy
in
the
receiving
home.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
the
other
staff
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
they
are
staff
probation
officers,
social
workers,
they
also
have
test,
a
clinic
doctor,
and
they
also
go
the
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no.
they
are
--
most
of
them
are
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
no.
not
on
his
--
not
on
the
regular
social
service
staff.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
they're
mostly
social
workers.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
on
legal
matters,
no,
i
don't
think
they
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
they
give
advice
on
waiver
matters,
yes.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
the
social
workers
and
the
final
report
usually
says
what
they
think.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
find
part
of
the
final
report
in
this
case
in
the
record
because
it
was
read
by
defense
counsel
at
the
trial,
to
add
into
the
record.
so,
you'll
find
that
the
social
worker
recommended
against
it,
that
this
case
be
waived.
there's
no
problem.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
the
social
files,
the
social
records
are
the
type
of
material
--
i
don't
say
they're
not
always
entitled
to
it.
i'm
saying
that
the
type
of
material
that
is
found
in
social
records
is
the
type
of
material
which
unless
there
are
some
particular
reason
why
the
defense
counsel
or
the
petitioner's
counsel
should
see
it,
is
not
the
type
of
material
that
should
be
made
public,
it
should
not
be
given
to
anyone.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statute
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
there
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
don't
know.
and
there's
no
reason
why
it
couldn't
be
made
public
then.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
happens.
the
record
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
really
happens,
you
see,
in
these
cases,
when
they
get
to
the
district
court
and
they
get
to
a
district
judge,
he
throws
up
his
hands
in
court
at
the
problem
of
deciding
what
to
give
to
counsel
and
he
actually
gives
in
the
whole
file.
the
whole
file,
he
doesn't
distinguish
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
in
the
district
court,
he
got
the
whole
file.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
not
for
a
waiver.
no.
and
that
was
at
the
time
--
and
now
let
me
go
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
it
isn't
that
the
juvenile
judge
feels
that
he
cannot.
i
don't
find
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
because
that
i
mean
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
the
statute
--
well,
there
are
two
things.
one,
the
statute
does
make
a
distinction
as
to
records.
the
statute
says
that
lawyers
and
parties
are
entitled
to
court
records.
the
statute
does
not
say
that
the
lawyers
are
entitled
to
social
records.
now,
this
is
a
statute
in
the
district
of
columbia,
passed
by
congress
and
then
make
this
distinction
in
their
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
no
it's
not
quite
that
silent
because
if
you
read
the
history
and
we
have
outlined
it
in
our
brief,
you
will
find
that
the
reason
to
prompt
the
part
about
the
social
records
would
put
in
to
the
statute
was
that
that
then
juvenile
judge
at
the
time
felt
that
she
could
not
give
social
records
to
anyone.
and
what
happened
was
when
a
juvenile
was
sent
to
some
agency,
the
agency
didn't
have
the
background,
didn't
have
the
test
that
had
been
made,
the
social
records
that
had
been
made,
the
studies
that
had
been
made
for
this
boy
so
that
the
agency
was
in
a
sense,
in
a
position
where
they
would
have
to
duplicate
these
records
in
order
to
rehabilitate
this
boy.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
assume
so.
there's
no
way
to
tell
in
this
record.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
social
records?
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
difficult
to
tell
because
it
never
--
what
has
happened
in
district
of
columbia
on
social
record
is
a
panel
composed
partly
of
the
judges
in
black
have
said
that
district
courts
--
district
courts,
not
juvenile
courts,
should
go
through
the
record
and
determine
on
these
questions
which
parts
of
the
social
record
should
be
given
to
counsel
in
particular
cases.
but
as
i
said
to
mr.
justice
brennan
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
happens
when
the
case
gets
back
to
the
district
judge
he
says,
“well,
i'm
not
qualified
to
distinguish
between
these
records
and
what
actually
happens
is
they
thought
they
have
to
give
him
the
whole
file.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
as
far
as
i
have
--
in
any
every
case
that
i
ever
found
that's
what
happened.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
don't
think
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
don't
think
you
have
to
take
judicial
notice
of
it,
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
particular
case,
in
this
particular
case
what
happened
was
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
and
i'd
like
to
talk
about
whether
it
was
a
hearing,
the
defense
counsel
was
actually
given
physically
all
of
the
social
records
in
this
case.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
this
was
prior
to
trial.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
you're
right.
at
trial
also,
counsel
asked
for
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
not.
now,
there
are
--
one
of
the
things
that
counsel
has
brushed
over
here
is
another
part
of
the
problem
about
waiver
in
the
district
of
columbia.
and
that's
this
business
about
the
motion
to
dismiss.
now,
there
was
no
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
when
this
case
went
out
on
habeas
corpus
as
well
as
from
the
district
of
columbia
municipal
court
at
that
time,
that
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
told
counsel,
“well,
you
can
go
back
and
you
can
raise
this
issue
at
the
district
court
level
and
you
can
have
a
hearing
on
this.”
but
they
pointed
out
that
you
also
must
recognize
that
you're
not
dealing
with
someone
new
when
you're
dealing
with
this
petitioner
because
he
was
in
front
of
the
juvenile
court
for
some
two
to
two
and
a
half
years.
so,
that
it
isn't
just
a
blank
kind
of
investigation.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
we've
never
really
answer
that
question
because
it
has
never
happened
that
way
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
-
it's
involved
here.
what
happened
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
there
is
an
alternative.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
there
is
--
well,
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
said
that
this
is
the
way
to
do
it.
there
--
but
as
i
was
going
to
say,
there
is
a
alternative
in
the
statute
namely
that
the
district
court
itself--
the
district
court
itself
can
consider
itself
a
juvenile
court.
and
therefore,
the
district
court
itself
can
handle
the
matter
as
a
juvenile
court
matter.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
think
if
i
explain
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes,
we
cited
a
case
on
our
brief
where
this
is
happened
in
the
district
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
as
i
say,
that's
never
been
decided
either.
they've
handled
it
themselves
as
the
juvenile
court
and
they
will
have
to
send
it
any
place
else.
they
can
constitute
themselves
a
juvenile
court.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
have
to
take
this
in
two
steps.
first
of
all,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
there
is
no
right
to
be
tried
any
other
way
than
the
constitution
would
apply.
statutorily,
there
can
be
rights
that
you
can
gain
by
statute
of
course
and
which
have
to
be
applied
as
a
matter
of
due
process.
in
this
case,
the
right
is
that
the
juvenile
not
be
waived
unless
--
this
is
statutory
right
now,
unless
there's
a
full
investigation.
i
would
assume
although
i
have
never
seen
any
case
that
if
the
court
--
the
district
court
found
a
case
where
there
was
no
investigation
at
all
and
thus
--
though
they
we're
not
quibbling
about
what
is
a
full
investigation.
they
would
say
that
this
had
been
an
arbitrary,
unfair,
then
they
even
say
unconstitutional
waiver.
at
that
point,
one
of
two
things
i
think
could
happen
either
they
would
decide,
as
i
say,
to
handle
it
as
a
juvenile
court
themselves
and
that
as
far
as
i
read
the
statute
means
the
full
power
of
juvenile
court
either
they
try
the
case
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
as
a
juvenile,
and
that
has
happened
here
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
send
him
to
a
training
school,
put
him
on
probation,
whatever
the
powers
of
the
juvenile
court.
or
they
could
and
in
turn
say
as
send
it
back
and
have
an
investigation
made.
as
i
say
that
has
not
happened,
it
is
not
clear
in
some
of
the
district
court's
opinions
and
court
of
--
particularly
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
some
of
the
district
judges
have
said
that
they're
not
sure
if
they
can
send
these
cases
back
to
the
juvenile
court.
that's
happened
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
of
course
that's
why
you
get
this
kind
of
fuzziness.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
but
in
this
case
there
was
a
hearing
and
that's
what
i'd
like
--
so
that
we
know
and
it
wasn't
as
counsel
says
there
was
no
hearing
because
if
you
read
this
record,
as
i
read
the
record,
you
will
find
that
what
happened
was
when
he
got
to
the
district
court,
the
judge
--
what
mr.
ehrlich
is
talking
about
when
he
says
emphatically
denied,
that
was
a
statement
made
by
judge
at
one
time
but
there's
also
another
spot
in
the
record
which
he
overlooks
and
that's
on
february
8,
1963
when
the
only
matter
before
the
district
judge
was
the
question
of
dismissing
the
case
and
at
that
time,
the
very
first
thing
that
defense
counsel,
that's
trial
counsel
now,
says
to
a
district
judge
is,
“well
now
the
first
thing
i
want
is
the
social
records.”
and
the
district
judge
says,
“well
i've
anticipated
you,
i
have
the
right
here
because
we're
going
to
have
this
hearing,
here
they
are.”
so
then
the
next
thing
is,
the
court
says,
“now,
what
do
you
plan
to
do?”
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
this
was
not
judge
tehan.
it
may
have
been,
there
were
two
or
three
judges
pretrial
here
and
i'm
not
certain
which
judge
this
was
but
i
can
give
--
this
was
the
transcript
you
will
find
at
the
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
there
isn't,
it's
another
matter.
i
better
explain
their
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
there
are
more
than
one
copy
of
the
transcript
in
the
record
in
this
court
and
unfortunately
they're
not
paginated
the
same.
the
transcript
which
the
government
cites
in
its
brief
you
will
find
in
a
blue
folder
and
it's
not
--
there
are
other
transcripts
which
are
bound
there
and
the
reason
for
the
difference
in
the
pagination
is
some
are
daily
transcripts
rather
than
official
court
transcripts.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
they
are
exactly
the
same
except
for
the
pagination,
it
may
differ
about
15
pages.
so,
if
you
--
you
have
to
find
the
citation
that
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
what
i'm
explaining
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
the
affirmative
is
this
--
yes,
it's
rather
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
not
the
one
that
we
cite.
now,
we'll
make
it
clear
now.
it's
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
this
is
part
of
--
this
is
also
part
of
a
transcript
and
part
of
a
daily
record
and
it's
the
same
transcript,
i
don't
mean
the
same,
because
they
have
difference
in
wording.
i
haven't
compared
it
word
by
word,
but
generally
it's
the
same.
but
you'd
find
in
another
transcript
which
we
have
marked
and
--
in
any
event
on
page
16
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i'm
not
certain.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
that
one
you
have
in
your
hand,
it
was
taken
out
of
the
files.
that
one
that
you
had
mr.
justice
white,
that
one
you
had
in
your
hand
is
the
one
that
we
used
as
the
main
transcript.
now,
there
are
some
additions
to
that.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky

february

1963.
oh
what
actually
happened
at
this
hearing,
i
think
that
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
that's
why
i
was
going
to
explain
what
happened
because,
the
judge
who
seizes,
well
now
you
have
question
before
me
is
whether
you
have
a
full
investigation.
you've
got
the
file,
now
what
do
you
want
to
show?
the
counsel
said,
“well,
i'd
like
to
put
the
mother
of
the
young
man
on
the
stand
to
show
that
she
was
not
spoken
to
very
much.”
well,
the
judge
at
that
point
says,
“but
that
isn't
going
to
show
that
there
was
not
a
full
investigation
and
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
had
already
told.
the
court
of
appeals
had
already
told
counsel
that
you've
got
to
remember
that
this
is
a
case
which
have
been
before
the
juvenile
court
for
some
two
and
a
half
years.
so
that
you're
not
going
to
find
it
just
suddenly,
a
full
investigation
had
been
a
lot
of
material
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
he
was
talking
about
the
whole
file.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
he
had
it
and
he
had
looked
at
it.
it's
very
clear
he
had
looked
at
it.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
what
he
said.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right
and
he
looked
at
the
file
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
that
may
have
been
but
i
don't
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
don't
read
the
record
that
way.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
now,
because
what
kind
of
testimony
was
defense
counsel
going
to
put
in?
see,
that's
important
thing.
he
wasn't
going
to
say
that
this
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes,
it
does
have
that
power.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
it's
in
the
statute
and
it's
been
gone
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
it's
in
the
statute.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
the
district
court
said,
they
would
not
do
it
in
this
case.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
in
juvenile
court
situations,
there
would
be,
because
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
proposed
standard
juvenile
court
act
which
is
a
model
act
for
the
entire
nation
has
that
as
one
of
the
criteria,
namely
that
the
facilities
are
not
available
for
treatment.
so,
i
see
no
--
but
i
think
there's
an
evident
--
there's
an
added
point
here.
it
isn't
just
facilities
or
buildings.
it's
also
the
fact
that
the
juvenile
court
can
only
administer
this
rehabilitation
until
the
juvenile
reaches
21.
as
you
read
the
social
record
and
as
counsel
would
have
it
at
the
trial,
this
is
a
case
where
the
young
man
will
have
to
be
treated
of
great
--
much
longer
than
21
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
are
you
asking
me
what
are
the
criteria,
the
standards?
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
that
may
be
involved
in
this
case
because
of
--
because
as
you
say,
one
of
the
concurring
judges
says
that
this
could
have
been
one
of
the
bases.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right,
it's
one
of
the
factors.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
oh
no,
not
an
exclusive
one
but
as
one
of
the
factors,
yes.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
think
that's
a
hard
question
because
it
may
depend
on
the
facts
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
it
depends
on
--
no,
i
think
it
depends
on
the
factual
problem
that
the
juvenile
court
has.
in
other
words,
what
i'm
saying
is
there
may
be
cases
where
an
investigation
would
disclose
other
facilities
or
where
there
may
be
other
reasons.
but
this
particular
case
under
any
of
the
standards
does
not
seem
to
fit
so
that
--
and
that's
why
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
saying
well,
it
may
have
been
better
to
add
these
but
under
any
of
those
standards
that
we
have
been
able
to
find,
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
this
particular
waiver.
and
as
we
say
in
our
brief
there
are
times
to
when
it
may
be
necessary
under
particular
factual
situation
even
to
have
informal
hearing
at
the
juvenile
court
level
and
the
court
of
appeals,
i
mean
the
district
of
columbia
courts
have
recognized
that
you
can't
have
such
an
informal
hearing
in
a
particular
factual
case.
but
i
don't
see
that
there's
any
constitutional
necessity
for
every
case
and
i
certainly
don't
see
under
any
of
the
standards
that
it
was
necessary
in
this
case.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
did
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no.
the
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
fairness
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
none.
as
i
--
not
fairly
committed
with
the
new
jersey
problem
and
you
written
some
of
the
cases
in
the
juvenile
court
field.
new
jersey
is
one
of
the
states,
as
far
as
i
know
it's
the
only
state
that
for
a
long
period
of
time
as
said
there
should
be
hearing
on
waiver.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
referral.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
that
would
--
there
was
no
reason
for
--
i
suppose
to
even
get
to
this
issue
and
there's
no
reason
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
get
to
this
issue
either
because
they
can
decide
he
can
have
lawyers
as
they
have.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
know
it
doesn't
involved
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
more
than
that.
it
says
as
i
recall
it
says
somewhere
in
here
that
they're
not
deciding
the
question
which
is
here,
which
has
to
do
with
the
hearing
there.
they're
not
going
to
decide
the
case
that's
here.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
new
jersey
is
half
of
the
states
now.
new
jersey
which
has
a
referral
process,
has
long
had
hearing
and
required
by
law,
by
court
decision,
the
model
act,
which
came
out
in
1959,
the
model
act
in
1959
also
suggests
that
there'd
be
hearing
but
it
has
other
things
that
we
do
not
have.
the
particular
district
of
columbia
act
which
came
in
1938
was
patterned
after
the
then
model
juvenile
court
act
which
did
not
have
any
provision
for
hearings.
and
you'll
find
that
the
bulk
of
the
states
do
not.
now,
the
problem
with
the
states
is
this,
first
of
all
a
great
number
of
states
have
no
referrals,
no
waivers,
there's
no
--
nothing
at
all
in
this
area.
secondly,
a
great
number
of
states
stop
at
age
16,
for
instance
new
york,
and
other
states
stopped
at
age
16.
so
the
bulk
of
the
problems
that
we're
dealing
with
never
really
bothers.
many
statutes
illuminate,
and
this
includes
by
the
way
the
federal
juvenile
delinquency
act
and
there
is
such
a
thing.
illuminate
those
cases
which
involved
capital
crimes
or
crimes
which
could
be
punished
by
life
imprisonment
because
this
on
its
face
almost,
you
see,
and
that
you'll
find
this
also
in
new
jersey
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
so
that
you
find
as
this
in
many
of
the
states
that
as
soon
as
they
say,
as
soon
as
you
find
this,
this
fact
but
then
you
have
a
cause
for
waiver.
now,
defense
counsel
was
not
going
to
show
that
--
and
this
is
why
i
was
getting
back
to
the
hearing
though
was
not
going
to
show
that
this
young
man
did
not
fit
under
any
of
the
criteria.
he
was
not
going
to
take
the
position
that
the
rape
in
this
case
had
not
occurred.
well,
he
was
not
going
to
say
that
there
had
not
been
a
long
history
with
this
young
man,
he
was
not
going
to
say
that
this
was
not
a
capital
crime,
he
was
not
--
in
other
words,
he
was
not
going
to
show
the
district
court
any
of
the
usual
things
which
one
would
think
about
in
terms
of
criteria.
and
that's
why
mr.
justice
white,
you
find
for
what
you
say
the
short
hearing
because
what
counsel
was
proposing
to
do
the
district
judge
said
that
would
not
affect
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
statute
had
been
complied
with.
and
we
think
that
actually
as
you
read
the
record
and
you
read
the
report,
the
first
report
even
--
and
see
what
happened
in
this
case,
you
see
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
case
which
the
juvenile
court
can
handle
regardless
of
whether
you
handle
--
whether
you
think
of
this
in
terms
of
a
mental
case
or
whether
you
think
in
terms
of
a
criminal
case.
in
either
event,
in
either
event,
this
was
the
kind
of
problem
which
deserved
a
hearing
in
the
district
--
federal
district
court
where
they
have
a
complete
facility.
now,
let
me
add
another
factor
to
the
facts,
there
was
a
competency
hearing.
counsel
is
not
quite
correct
as
to
what
the
hospital
had
to
say
and
the
records
are
here.
what
happened
was
this,
the
district
--
the
d.c.
general
hospital
which
is
a
local
hospital
in
district
of
columbia
said
that
they
had
no
opinion,
no
opinion
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
mentally
ill
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
no
opinion
and
that's
in
their
letter.
they
said,
however,
that
he
was
mentally
incompetent
to
stand
trial
which
is
a
different
matter.
when
this
case
got
to
the
st.
elizabeths,
the
report
from
st.
elizabeths
over
the
signature
of
doctor
--
then
doctor
overholser,
was
superintendent,
said
that
this
boy
was
competent
to
stand
trial.
there
was
a
hearing
on
this
issue.
two
psychiatrists
testified,
and
only
two
testified,
they
both
said,
they
both
said,
that
this
young
man
was
competent
to
stand
trial.
now,
you
can
read
the
record
in
various
ways,
in
slang
here
and
maybe
it
wasn't
quite
this
much,
but
this
i
think
is
clear
in
the
record
and
this
is
the
finding
of
the
district
judge
prior
to
trial.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
they
said
that
they
thought
he
was
mentally
ill.
at
the
trial,
this
is
the
next
stage,
at
the
trial,
we
had
the
evidence
of
all
of
these
psychiatrists
and
it
is
not
that
one-sided.
what
happened
was
this.
at
the
trial
the
facts
of
the
particular
crimes
became
evident.
in
other
words,
the
fact
was
that
the
petitioner
would
go
into
this
--
into
a
particular
house
and
he
would
rob
the
victim,
find
the
wallet,
get
the
money,
and
in
one
case
he
just
happened
to
see
the
woman
and
she
wasn't
fully
dressed
and
at
that
point
he
raped
her.
now,
when
the
facts
of
the
crimes
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
psychiatrists,
you
do
not
find
the
unanimity
that
counsel
would
lead
you
to
believe
is
in
this
record.
what
you
find
is
that
many
of
the
psychiatrists
and
these
include
people
at
st.
elizabeths,
doctor
dobbs
and
others
feel
that
--
well,
he
may
have
been
rational,
fully
competent
and
knew
what
he
was
doing
when
he
went
in
to
rob
these
victims.
but
when
he
happened
to
see
this
woman,
his
mental
condition
may
have
contributed
to
the
rape.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
may
have
and
did.
you
find
both.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
you
find
both,
so
that
what
we
say
is
the
verdict
of
this
jury
is
fully
supported
by
the
evidence
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
the
evidence
does
show
that
it
is
possible
for
the
jury
to
find
that
the
defendant
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
on
the
rape
charges
and
nevertheless
guilty
of
the
house
breaking
and
the
robbery.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
would
be
there
until
he
recovers.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
it
might
mean
for
life.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct
and
he's
not
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
we
have
put
in
our
brief
a
section
on
sentencing
although
it
is
not
raised
because
we
feel
that
this
court
should
know
about
the
problem.
the
problem
of
relief
is
this,
there
is
no
question
in
our
minds
despite
what
cases
petitioner
cited
in
supplemental
brief
that
the
juvenile
court
does
not
have
any
jurisdiction
after
the
age
21.
the
fact
is
that
this
young
man
is
now
in
st.
elizabeths
hospital.
there
is
a
statute,
there
is
a
statute
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
i
suppose
because
only
the
district
of
columbia
has
this
kind
of
verdict
even
in
the
federal
courts,
you
don't
find
this
any
place
else.
district
of
columbia
has
a
statute
which
the
board
of
parole
can
go
back
to
the
district
judge
and
say
to
the
district
judge,
this
boy,
this
young
man
has
now
been
rehabilitated.
now,
we
think
that
he
is
now
--
you
could
not
let
him
out
and
you
can
change
the
sentence.
the
statutes
specifically
provides
that
for
the
district
judge
to
change
the
sentence
at
that
time
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
assume
he
can
eliminate
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
assume
he
can
eliminate
it.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
discharging
him
completely,
completely.
so
there's
a
peculiar
problem
of
course
in
the
district
of
columbia
but
there's
an
answer
to
it
that
is
peculiar
also.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
five
to
15
years
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
each
count.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
to
run
consecutively.
now,
i
think
it's
hard
for
me
to
put
myself
in
place
of
the
district
judge,
i
don't
have
the
probation
report,
i
don't
know
what
he
was
thinking
of.
he's
very
well
could've
had
in
mind
however
this
particular
statute
realizing
that
this
--
that
this
was
not
that
kind
of
a
sentence
but
was
the
kind
sentence
as
a
result
of
all
these
crimes
having
him
been
found
guilty.
it's
also
important
i
think
that
this
--
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
the
defense
counsel
--
the
defense
counsel
said
to
the
judge
whatever
sentence
you
give
to
this
defendant
and
it
may
be
30
or
40
years,
that
was
defense
counsel
talking,
had
it
run
concurrently
or
with
the
time
he
is
pending
in
st.
elizabeths.
as
a
matter
of
fact
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
defends
counsel
said,
“he
may
very
well
spend
a
lifetime
there.”
so
that
what
the
judge
was
doing
really
if
you
--
as
you
read
the
sentencing,
he
is
saying,
“i'll
agree
with
defense
counsel.”
the
government
made
no
recommendation.
it
said
absolutely
nothing
about
the
sentence.
the
defense
counsel
did
say
this
at
the
time,
of
course,
defense
counsel
was
aware
that
this
was
not
all
there
was
to
this
case.
so
that
on
the
matter
of
sentencing,
we
feel
that
the
statute
as
applied
in
this
particular
case
is
the
safety
valve,
can
easily
be
applied
and
this
is
the
kind
of
case
for
--
as
a
particular
problem
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
the
juvenile
court
would
have
a
difficult
problem
because
they
could
not
have
treated
them
themselves.
what
they
could
have
done
is
transfer
the
case
out
really
of
both
juvenile
court
and
district
court.
and
by
that,
i
mean
this,
they
would've
found
that
someway,
and
this
has
happened,
to
have
a
young
man
committed
by
the
mental
health
commission.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
civilly
committed.
i
know
of
no
case
that
they
have
done
where
they
had
this
kind
of
factual
background.
in
other
words,
i
--
and
i
can
understand
why
that
the
mental
--
furthermore,
the
mental
health
commission
also
doesn't
like
to
be
treated
as
the
kind
of
place
to
handle
criminal
cases
that
can't
be
handled
criminally.
and
as
always
this
hiatus
of
who
has
jurisdiction,
a
different
setup
under
the
district
of
columbia
board
of
welfare
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
it
seems
that
the
problem
that
the
juvenile
judge
faced
that
he
was
faced
with
a
young
man
who
was
of
average
intelligence,
he
wasn't
sure
which
way
it
would
go
whether
he
was
criminally
responsible
for
all
of
these
offenses,
and
also
whether
there
was
some
mental
problems
here.
but
from
the
evidence
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
think
what
you're
asking
now
is
whether
or
not
the
juvenile
judge
could've
held
the
kind
of
hearing
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
it
was
actually
held
at
the
district
court
level.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
honestly
cannot
say
that
he
could
because
it
seems
to
me
that
when
he
became
21
that
the
juvenile
court
would've
been
done.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
don't
--
the
90
years,
i'm
not
--
i
cannot
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
as
i
say,
i
cannot
answer
why
he
got
the
90
years.
the
problem
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
i
explained
why
the
judge
could
have
given
this
young
man
30
or
40
years
because
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
as
i
read
the
defense
counsel
said,
he
may
be
defense
counsel
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
the
sentence
in
this
case
is
twofold.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
there
is
no
sentence
in
regard
to
the
mental
problem.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
this
is
statutory.
what
happened
--
that
sentence
was
five
to
15
years
on
each
count,
that's
30
to
90
years.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct
and
that
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
in
the
federal
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
we
have
a
statute
which
says
that
regardless
of
the
lengths
of
the
sentence
after
15
years,
a
defendant
is
eligible
for
parole.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
we
have
--
in
the
federal
system,
generally
we
do
not
have
minimum
and
maximum.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
they
can
ask
for
a
parole
in
15
years
on
a
life
sentence.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
as
i
read
the
case,
there's
no
question
about
it.
he
is
entitled
to
a
lawyer.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
as
i
read
the
case
which
the
counsel
has
cited
this
morning,
they
say
that
lawyer
is
entitled
to
do
just
exactly
what
the
lawyer
did
in
this
case,
namely,
supply
the
juvenile
judge
with
information
which
the
lawyer
thinks
would
aid
the
juvenile
judge
in
making
a
determination
on
waiver.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
as
far
as
i
know,
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
they're
tied
together,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
i
think
what
i'm
saying
is
this,
that
the
fact
he
made
a
motion
didn't
add
anymore
to
what
he
wanted.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
but
the
juvenile
judge
had
this
information,
the
question
really
is
whether
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
because
that's
what
he
asked
for
in
the
motion.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes
there
is.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
then
he
asked
for
documents
also.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that
is
correct.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
do
not
read
the
cases
as
saying
that
you
can
--
that
the
purpose
of
the
lawyer
is
to
make
motions
in
the
juvenile
court.
this
is
not
a
criminal
case.
the
purpose
of
the
lawyer
and
the
purpose
of
the
transfer
is
not
to
decide
a
critical
issue
in
the
criminal
case.
the
purpose
of
the
transfer
is
to
decide
what
kind
of
facilities
are
available
in
the
juvenile
court
unlike
cases
that
had
been
cited
here
today
such
as
the
white
and
others
which
talked
about
a
critical
stage
in
a
criminal
case.
nothing
at
this
level
is
that
--
is
a
critical
stage
because
this
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
preliminary
or
an
indictment
and
all
of
the
regular
rights
that
you
find
in
ordinary
criminal
cases.
what
happened
was
there
was
a
decision
made
that
the
facilities
or
that
the
fact
that
he
had
committed
seven
sexual
offenses
was
not
the
type
of
matter
that
the
juvenile
judge
--
well,
that
he
could
handle.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i'm
not
saying
that
they
can
be
an
arbitrary
transfer.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
he
is
not
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
he
is
not
entitled
to
the
social
records
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
in
that
motion.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
think
what
happened,
i
don't
know
because
there's
no
provision
for
motion
and
such
in
juvenile
court.
what
seems
to
happen
here
was
that
judge
was
--
the
juvenile
judge
is
concerned
with
the
transfer.
he
is
looking
at
the
social
records.
this
is
the
thing
that
he
is
making
up
his
mind
on
and
in
those
records
he
finds
what
mr.
arens
has
supplied
to
him.
and
he
can
decide
for
that,
(a)
do
we
need
a
hearing,
do
i
need
some
further
information
after
all
he's
an
experienced
man
with
the
facilities
in
the
district?
do
i
need
some
further
information
or
do
--
or
is
this
sufficient,
is
this
a
full
enough
investigation
to
say
that
the
juvenile
facilities
are
not
adequate
to
handle
this
or
the
motions
did
not
say
--
the
motion
did
not
say
either
that
the
juvenile,
not
committed
the
crime,
he
did
not
--
in
other
words,
what
i'm
saying
is
the
motions
did
not
go
to
the
criteria
which
the
juvenile
judge
had
to
make
up
his
mind
upon.
so,
whether
the
judge
actually
denied
them
or
not,
and
i
don't
find
this
in
the
record
at
all,
i
--
it
makes
no
difference
on
the
question
of
transfer
because
these
problems
are
problems
whether
or
not
the
facilities
are
there.
certainly,
i
find
no
constitutional
reason
for
a
hearing.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
my
answer
is
no,
it
would
not
be,
but
i
think
i
must
correct
the
statement
of
facts
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
because
those
are
not
the
facts.
the
fact
is
in
this
record
that
this
juvenile
was
picked
up
on
the
basis
of
fingerprint
--
latent
fingerprints
that
were
found
in
the
apartment
of
a
woman
who
was
raped.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
42?
i
guess
i've
been
too
expansive
in
the
brief.
what
actually
happened
was
this
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
what
actually
happened
was
this,
at
the
trial
--
the
government
put
on
the
expert
witness,
and
in
the
course
of
--
as
to
the
fingerprints,
and
into
the
course
of
that,
the
expert
witness
had
a
number
of
photographs
of
other
prints.
defense
--
at
that
point,
no
objection
was
made
to
the
use
of
them
as
comparison
prints.
it
did
not
say
that
they
were
--
the
prints
were
taken
at
an
arrest
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
that
in
the
record
of
the
print.
the
record
at
trial
i
mean
does
not
say
that.
the
arrest
comes
in
because
we
know
pretrial
how
these
fingerprints
came
about.
in
other
words,
pretrial
the
court
was
informed
that
the
prints
were
obtained
because
the
juvenile
had
been
picked
up
previously
and
arrested.
but
at
the
trial
what
happened
was,
they
merely
made
a
comparison,
and
at
the
trial
defense
counsel
stipulated
that
these
prints
were
the
prints
of
the
defendant.
so,
the
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
agree
with
you.
this
is
not
and
i
agree
with
you,
we
have
to
take
to
what
the
record
says
rather
than
what
the
brief
says.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
can
do
that.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
could
--
we
can
do
it
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
oh
yes,
yes
certainly.
