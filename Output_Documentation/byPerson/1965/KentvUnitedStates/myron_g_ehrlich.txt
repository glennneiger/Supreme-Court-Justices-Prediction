mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
yes
sir,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
district
of
columbia
circuit.
i
was
assigned
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
to
prefect
the
petitioner's
appeal
from
the
district
court
to
that
court.
mr.
arens
represented
the
petitioner
in
the
juvenile
court.
i
am
here
just
as
a
public
service
representing
an
indigent
without
compensation
and
so
is
mr.
arens
who
joined
me
in
this
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
the
facts
in
this
case
if
the
court
pleases
are
that
on
--
on
or
about
september
5,
1961,
the
accused
in
this
case
was
arrested
by
officers
of
the
metropolitan
police
department
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
he
at
that
time
have
been
a
ward
of
the
juvenile
court
for
some
two
years.
it
appears
from
the
record
that
he
was
arrested
because
two
years
prior
to
that
time,
the
police
department
had
taken
him
without
authority
of
the
juvenile
court
to
the
police
department
and
there
had
him
fingerprinted
at
the
time
when
he
was
14
years
of
age
and
they
discovered
some
fingerprints
in
the
areas
of
these
houses
in
which
the
accused
allegedly
broke
in
when
he
was
16
years
old
and
they
finally
discovered
that
this
16-year-old
boy
was
the
boy
whose
his
fingerprints
were
in
the
vicinity
of
two
or
three
of
these
areas
together
with
other
fingerprints.
after
they
arrested
him
in
this
case,
they
questioned
him
for
some
four
or
five
days,
as
i
read
the
record,
and
on
the
second
day
of
his
arrest,
his
mother
retained
or
asked
mr.
arens
to
come
into
court
and
to
represent
the
indigent
accused
who
was
then
16
years
old.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
yes
sir.
he
apparently
made
a
confession
which
is
not
used
in
evidence
against
him.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
no
sir.
and
on
that
confession,
let
me
say
that
there
was
a
search
warrant
issued
and
the
discoveries
is
on
to
the
search
warrant
would
not
be
used
in
evidence
against
him.
however,
his
fingerprints
taken
when
he
was
14
years
old
compared
to
his
fingerprints
taken
when
he
was
16
years
old
at
a
time
prior
to
the
time
of
waiver
of
jurisdiction
or
probably
the
principal
--
was
the
principal
evidence
against
him
upon
which
the
conviction
was
based.
and
of
course
it
is
our
contention
that
they
taking
of
the
fingerprints
when
he
was
14
and
the
taking
of
the
fingerprints
of
him
when
he
was
16
was
in
violation
of
the
law
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
those
fingerprints
were
inadmissible
in
evidence,
and
for
that
reason,
we
believe
that
there's
reversible
error
in
this
case
for
that
reason
alone.
nevertheless,
if
i
may
go
on,
about
a
day
or
so
after
the
accused
was
being
questioned
by
the
police
almost
continually.
mr.
arens
filed
the
first
of
his
number
of
motions.
and
the
first
motion
asked
the
juvenile
court
to
not
to
turn
the
accused
or
do
something
about
the
accused
being
in
the
hands
of
the
police
not
to
commit
them
to
continually
interrogate
him.
then
in
this
--
that
motion
was
never
heard,
never
answered
and
mr.
arens
filed
another
motion
in
the
case
and
this
was
quite
lengthy.
the
second
motion
in
this
case,
will
the
juvenile
court
to
transfer
immediately
to
the
district
of
columbia
general
hospital
psychiatric
division
for
appropriate
psychiatric
observation
to
disclose
his
social
service
record
to
counsel
and
to
hold
a
hearing
immediately
after
the
termination
of
the
period
of
hospitalization
if
waiver
of
jurisdiction
of
this
case
was
conflict
as
the
condition
preceding
to
any
valid
label.
now
the
court
must
remember
that
the
--
this
juvenile
court
here,
as
well
as
all
--
every
juvenile
court
of
united
states
that
i
know
and
i
think
about,
has
the
authority
to
waive
jurisdiction
under
certain
conditions.
now,
they
also
by
act
of
congress
have
the
authority
to
provide
social
service
records
that
i
referred
to
for
inspection
under
certain
conditions
and
the
conditions
set
forth
in
the
statute
states
that
such
records
or
parts
thereof
shall
be
made
available
by
rule
of
court
or
special
order
of
court
to
such
persons
governmental
and
private
agencies
and
institutions
has
--
had
a
legitimate
interest
in
the
protection,
welfare,
treatment
and
rehabilitation
of
a
child.
nevertheless,
neither
one
of
mr.
arens'
motions
were
ever
answered
nor
was
he
--
were
they
ever
heard
but
about
seven
days
after
they
arrested
the
accused
he
was
--
jurisdiction
was
waived
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
in
the
juvenile
court,
yes
sir.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
and
they
were
in
writing.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
mr.
arens
apparently
immediately
appealed
to
what
it
--
then
was
the
municipal
court
of
appeals
for
failure
of
the
juvenile
court
to
do
these
things
as
contained
in
his
motion.
and
he
also
sued
out
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court.
the
habeas
corpus
was
issued,
a
hearing
was
held
upon
it
and
relief
was
denied.
the
writ
was
discharged
and
mr.
arens
immediately
appealed
that
writ
of
habeas
corpus
--
i
mean
to
deny
--
the
discharge
of
it
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
while
that
was
standing
also
the
municipal
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
ruled
against
mr.
arens'
contention
and
he
filed
leave
for
--
motion
for
leave
to
appeal
to
the
united
states
district
court
this
affirmance
by
the
municipal
court
of
what
the
juvenile
court
had
done.
now,
both
of
those
appeals
were
heard
together
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
they
decided,
one,
that
habeas
corpus
would
not
lie
and
they
indicated
that
habeas
corpus
was
unnecessary
because
they
said
that
the
petitioner
could
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
he
alleged
in
this
habeas
corpus
petition.
and
on
the
appeal
from
the
ruling
of
the
juvenile
court
that
came
up
to
the
municipal
court
of
appeals
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
decided
that
that
was
not
an
appealable
order
and
therefore
they
would
not
consider
it
any
further.
however,
prior
to
the
time
that
united
states
court
of
appeals
decided
that
this
could
be
done
by
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
mr.
arens,
an
able
lawyer,
said
that
he
has
had
already
filed
such
a
motion
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
he
would
not
this
--
there
was
not
a
full
investigation
in
the
juvenile
court,
as
required
by
law,
he
was
not
permitted
to
see
the
social
service
records
of
this
indigent
16-year-old
boy
who
would
then
a
ward
of
that
court
for
some
two
years
and
there
was
no
way
in
the
world
that
he
could
rebut
any
ground
that
the
court
may
have
had
for
waiving
jurisdiction
and
so
forth.
both
of
those
motions
were
overruled
without
any
hearing
of
any
type
to
district
court
judge
sitting
there
overruled
both
of
the
motions
and
the
motion
of
mr.
arens
contained
an
alternative
that
is
that
under
the
statute
a
district
court
judge
is
permitted
to
consider
the
case
as
the
juvenile
court
judge
and
mr.
arens
asked
in
his
motion
that
the
indictment
either
be
dismissed
or
in
the
alternative
that
the
district
court
sit
as
a
juvenile
court
in
this
case.
now,
the
district
court
judge
overruled
that
without
a
hearing
with
emphasis,
and
we
say
that
the
failure
to
give
a
hearing
in
itself
is
reversible
error
because
how
in
the
world
could
the
district
court
judge
know
whether
or
not
he
should
sit
at
a
juvenile
court
unless
he
hear
some
evidence
in
the
case
unless
he
hears
some
argument
in
the
case.
now,
we
say
that
the
failure
to
do
it
and
i
may
use
authority
for
it,
judge
wright
about
court
of
appeals
from
the
district
of
columbia
in
a
concurring
opinion
in
a
case
decided,
october
15,
1964,
have
this
to
say,
“the
trial
court
denied
the
defense
motion
that
defendant
be
tried
as
a
juvenile
without
holding
a
hearing
to
determine
the
legal
and
factual
basis
for
the
most.”
it
says,
“i
agree
that
the
conviction
should
be
reversed.
i
simply
state
my
reasons,”
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
judge
--
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
wright
--
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
--
name
to
this
case
sir
is
--
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
no
sir.
i
don't
think
so,
brown
versus
the
united
states
of
america.
it
was
decided
october
15,
1964
the
number
of
it
is
18487
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
now,
after
the
district
court
judge
denied
without
hearing
both
of
the
motion
filed
in
this
case,
the
case
went
on
to
trial
and
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
apparently
the
principal
defects
of
the
accused
was
insanity.
prior
to
that
time,
the
accused
had
been
sent
to
d.c.
general
hospital
for
their
report
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
suffering
from
a
mental
disease
at
the
time
when
he
committed
the
act
and
two
if
he
was
--
was
the
act
a
product
of
that
mental
disease.
the
d.c.
general
hospital
asked
to
have
doctors,
go
to
report
to
the
clerk
as
they
must
do
under
the
dc
code
that
the
accused
was
suffering
from
a
mental
diseases
at
the
time
he
committed
the
offense
and
that
the
act
was
a
product
of
that
mental
disease.
apparently,
the
united
states
government
to
its
prosecution
was
not
content
without
appraisal
of
that
diagnosis
by
the
d.c.
general
hospital
staff
and
they
asked
the
court
to
have
the
accused
sent
to
st.
elizabeths
hospital.
st.
elizabeths
hospital
sent
a
report
some
90
days
later
to
the
district
of
columbia
court,
the
district
court
with
the
same
report
that
the
accused
was
suffering
from
a
mental
disease
and
that
the
act
if
committed
by
him,
the
act
with
which
he
was
charged,
that
they
were
the
products
of
that
mental
disease.
nevertheless,
the
government
proceeded
to
try
the
accused
who
had
been
indicted
on
three
cases
of
house
breaking,
three
cases
of
robbery
and
two
counts
of
rape.
and
as
i
have
indicated,
his
principal
defense
was
insanity.
he
was
found
not
guilty
of
a
two
counts
of
rape
on
the
ground
that
he
was
suffering
from
a
mental
disease
at
the
time
he
committed
the
offenses
and
that
the
acts
if
committed
by
him
were
the
products
of
that
mental
disease.
and
under
our
statute,
an
accused,
if
found
not
guilty
under
those
circumstances
has
to
be
sent
to
st.
elizabeths
hospital
until
such
time
as
the
doctor
superintendent
certifies
and
the
court
is
satisfied
that
he'll
be
no
longer
dangerous
to
himself
and
to
others.
however,
that
same
jury
convicted
him
of
the
six
counts,
three
of
house
breaking
and
three
of
robbery
and
the
accused
was
sentenced
to
90
years
from
the
penitentiary,
15
years
on
each
count,
the
maximum
provided
by
law
and
90
years
in
the
district
of
columbia
is
the
equivalent
of
two
life
sentence,
now,
which
means
that
he
was
sentenced
to
90
years
even
though
under
the
verdict
of
the
jury
on
the
rape
charges,
he
is
confined
as
a
mental
deficient
in
st.
elizabeths
hospital
because
the
jury
had
decided
that
the
acts
were
the
products
of
a
mental
disease
from
which
he
was
suffering
at
the
time.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
in
june.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
they
were
together
apparently
mr.
chief
justice,
he
was
charged
in
going
in
one
house
--
breaking
in
one
house
and
stealing
a
pocketbook
and
raping
some
persons
who
was
in
that
particular
place.
i
would
say
that
the
two
rapes
and
two
of
the
alleged
house
breaking
and
robbery
charges
are
acts
for
all
--
simultaneous
--
altogether.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
altogether,
yes.
altogether.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
i
haven't
got
to
that,
we
will
get
to
that
right
now.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
yes
sir.
the
issue
of
fact
was
only
on
the
question
of
insanity
sir.
now,
after
st.
elizabeths
hospital
sent
to
the
court,
i
mean
they've
said
--
said
that
the
accused
was
suffering
from
a
mental
disease
at
the
time
he
committed
these
acts
--
if
the
acts
if
committed
by
him
are
the
products
of
this
mental
disease,
the
government
was
not
content
and
put
the
accused
on
trial.
now,
all
of
the
doctors
from
st.
elizabeths
hospital
and
all
of
the
doctors
i
think
there
were
some
dozen
or
more
from
dc
general
testified
that
the
accused
was
suffering
from
a
mental
disease
and
the
acts
if
committed
by
him
were
the
products
of
those
diseases.
however,
one
doctor
who
had
agreed
with
the
original
report
testified
that
the
accused
was
then
of
unsound
mind,
that
the
accused
was
suffering
from
a
mental
disease
at
the
time
these
alleged
acts
were
committed.
however,
if
he
--
if
the
facts
indicated
that
the
accused
went
in
to
these
premises
originally
for
the
purpose
of
committing
robbery
and
not
committing
rape
then
he
could
not
say
that
the
acts
were
the
product
or
the
--
of
the
mental
disease
but
if
the
accused
went
into
these
premises
for
the
purpose
of
committing
rape
first
and
then
incidentally
rob,
then
he
could
say
that
his
acts
were
the
product
of
that
disease.
and
one
doctor
testified
to
that
and
he
was
one
of
the
dozen
or
more
doctors
who
had
previously
certified
the
other
way.
that
was
the
only
issue
of
fact
involved
apparently.
now,
unfortunately,
the
counsel,
not
mr.
arens,
who
represented
the
accused
at
the
trial,
failed
to
raise
any
of
these
points
and
i
must
honestly
say
to
the
court
that
all
of
the
points
that
i
have,
have
to
be
considered
as
plain
error
affecting
the
substantial
right
of
this
defendant.
otherwise,
we
have
no
standing
in
court
at
all.
now,
when
this
case
went
to
the
jury,
the
district
court
judge
gave
what
in
his
charge
in
chief
what
he
indicated
to
be
his
so-called
“allen”
charge.
now,
from
a
reading
of
this,
we
say
that
it
is
coercive
charge
and
it
was
a
violation
of
the
accused
rights
and
that
in
and
of
itself,
in
our
opinion
and
it
is
our
contention
that
it
is
and
constitutes
reversible
error
because
we
say
it
is
coercive,
that
it
was
given
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
a
settlement,
that
indeed
a
settlement
was
made
by
the
jury
in
this
case.
they
certainly
settled
it
when
they
found
the
accused
not
guilty
of
two
capital
counts
charging
rape
on
the
ground
of
insanity
and
found
him
guilty,
therefore,
not
of
unsound
mind
of
six
counts,
three
of
house
breaking
and
three
of
robbery
at
all
of
the
offenses
committed
at
the
same
time
or
at
least
one
rape,
alleged
rape
and
robbery
and
house
breaking
was
committed
at
one
time
and
another
alleged
rape,
had
robbery
and
house
breaking
was
committed
at
the
same
time.
so
the
accused
in
our
opinion
was
injured
by
what
we
say
is
a
coercive
and
improper
charge
by
the
district
court
judge
when
he
gave
the
so-called
“allen”
charge
in
his
charging
chief
to
the
jury.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
sir?
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
i
think
some
five
or
six
hours
and
that
--
i
think
about
that
long,
yes.
i
must
say
to
the
court
that
we
contend
and
contend
most
seriously
that
this
accused
like
any
accused
is
entitled
to
a
disagreement
by
a
jury.
he's
entitled
to
that
and
he's
entitled
constitutionally
to
that,
a
fair
trial
if
the
jury
can't
agree,
a
whole
trial
jurors
can't
agree,
he's
entitled
to
a
disagreement.
now,
we
say
it
is
not
up
to
the
court
to
coerce
into
rendering
a
verdict
one
way
or
the
other
at
least
one
way
against
him.
now,
finally
i
will
say
to
the
court
without
going
into
minute
details
that
we
based
our
contentions
in
this
case
for
a
reversal
on
the
fact
that
the
juvenile
court
failed
to
accord
the
accused
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
that
they
failed
to
permit
him
to
look
at
the
social
service
records
so
he
could
give
him
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
that
they
gave
him
no
hearing
on
this
waiver,
we
say
that
that
is
the
violation
of
the
rights
of
the
accused.
they
gave
him
no
hospitalization,
we
say
that
is
a
violation
of
the
statute
on
psychiatric
examinations
for
the
purpose
of
attempting
to
discover
whether
or
not
they
would
waive
or
not
waive
jurisdiction
over
him.
they
gave
him
no
full
investigation.
they
gave
him
no
hearing
on
the
district
court
on
his
motion
to
dismiss
or
consider
themselves
the
district
court
to
consider
itself
a
juvenile
court.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
no
sir,
they
were
timely
raised.
mr.
myron

yes.
mr.
myron

sir,
yes.
mr.

yes.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
yes.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
yes.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
the
points
that
were
raised
below
where
the
two
motions
in
the
juvenile
court
and
that
is
to
look
to
some
social
records
to
grant
the
boy
a
hearing,
to
get
psychiatric
examination
of
him
and
also
raised
below
that
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
--
he
had
not
been
accorded
these
things
and
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed
off
--
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
yes.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
yes
sir.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
yes,
of
trier
of
the
fact.
mr.
myron

yes.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
yes
sir.
mr.
myron

yes

mr.
myron

yes

mr.

psychiatric
testimony
and
the
“allen”
--
so-called
“allen”
charge.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
no
sir,
they
were
not
raised.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
well,
there
might
and
there
might
not
be,
mr.
justice.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
yes.
there
might
be.
but
again
we've
run
into
this
proposition.
this
case
has
been
pending
so
long
that
this
boy
is
now
21
years
of
age.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
now
the
question
is,
does
the
juvenile
court
have
jurisdiction
or
can
the
district
court
reindict
him.
i
don't
think
the
district
court
can
reindict
him.
i
think
the
case
--
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
well,
i
don't
--
that's
a
case
a
matter
of
first
impression
with
me
and
i
am
not
sure
but
i
would
say
that
if
any
court,
if
either
court
has
jurisdiction,
it
would
have
to
be
juvenile
court.
but
i
won't
say
this
if
the
court
pleases,
we
have
a
statute
here
which
permits
the
juvenile
court
or
the
board
of
public
welfare
any
time
up
until
a
man
is
45
years
of
age
to
send
him
to
an
institution.
we
also
have
a
civil
commitment
statute
for
people
who
have
unsound
mind.
and
there
isn't
any
real
necessity
for
this
case
to
be
tried
as
a
criminal.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
sir?
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
no
sir.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
no,
the
judge
overruled
it
without
permitting
a
hearing.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
no
sir,
i
said
it
was
set
for
a
hearing.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
there
was
--
the
court
accorded
the
no
hearing
to
the
accused
on
either
motion.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
no
sir.
i
wasn't
the
counsel
in
that
case
but
i
happen
to
be
in
the
court
that
day.
counsel
was
not
permitted
to
argue
in
either
motion.
the
judge
says
i
overrule
it
with
emphasis.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
yes
sir.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
judge
tehan.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
there
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
--
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
--
(voice
overlap)
and
there
were
affidavits.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
the
affidavits
--
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
the
affidavit
is
attached
to
this
motion
in
this
case.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
and
there
was
no
controversy.
no
contraverting
affidavits
at
all,
no
answer
by
the
united
states
government
and
the
judge
says,
“i
overrule
it
without
a
hearing,
with
emphasis.”
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
he
never
looked
at
it.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
this
came
up
to
this
manner,
mr.
justice.
we
have
a
system
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
in
which
at
9:30
in
the
morning
the
assigned
judge
sends
cases
out
to
the
other
judge.
and
this
case
came
up,
was
on
the
assignment
and
the
assignment
judge
on
that
day
said,
“i'm
going
to
send
this
case
out
to
a
judge.”
and
just
at
that
moment
the
attorney
who
was
then
representing
the
accused
get
up
and
said,
“there
are
two
motions
pending.”
he
says,
“what
are
they?”
they
say
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
in
the
alternative
to
consider
yourself
a
juvenile
court.
he
says,
“motion
is
overruled
with
emphasis.”
he
never
looked
at
it.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
and
there
was
--
let
me
say
this,
i
am
just
reminded
that
there
was
an
offer
of
proof
made
by
the
then
counsel
in
that
case
and
the
court
wouldn't
listen
to
it.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
now,
a
few
more
words
with
reference
to
committee,
the
examination
of
the
social
service
record.
on
december
8,
1965,
in
case
number
19038,
black
versus
the
united
states
decided
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
19038.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
black
versus
united
states,
december
8,
1965,
the
day
prior
to
the
day
that
this
case
was
originally
set
for
argument
before
this
court,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
with
another
panel
decided
that
counsel
in
the
juvenile
court
was
entitled
to
look
at
the
social
records
of
the
accused
for
the
purposes
which
--
we
wanted
to
do
it
in
this
kent
case.
now,
here's
what
the
court
says,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
indicates
on
page
3.
now,
they
say
this,
kent
illustrates
the
need
for
counsel
to
develop
information
relative
to
waiver
and
they
said
in
here
as
one
of
the
basis
for
the
decision
in
the
black
case
what
kept
the
petitioner
here
attempted
to
do
when
he
was
in
the
juvenile
court.
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
reverses
practically
everything
that
another
panel
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
said
in
kent
--
in
kent,
the
case
that
we
are
arguing
here.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
in
this
panel,
it
was
judge
bazelon,
fahy,
and
leventhal.
in
the
other
panel,
it
was
mcgowan,
washington
and
danaher.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
i
will
read
to
the
court.
they
said,
we
hold
that
the
assistance
--
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
i'm
reading
from
the
black
versus
united
states
decided
december
8,
1965
at
united
states
court
of
appeals
from
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
no
sir,
this
is
an
opinion.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
number
19038,
just
decided
december
8,
1965.
it's
in
our
supplemental
brief,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
in
the
black
case
had
this
to
say,
we
hold
that
the
assistance
of
counsel
and
the
equivocally
important
determination
of
waiver
is
essential
to
the
proper
administration
of
juvenile
proceedings.
disabilities
resulting
from
conviction
in
the
district
court
are
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
effects
of
the
juvenile
court
commitment
which
does
not
operate
to
impose
any
of
the
civil
disabilities
ordinarily
imposed
by
conviction.
and
the
child
is
not
deemed
criminal
by
reason
of
an
adjudication.
treatment
as
a
juvenile
is
not
a
statutory
bounty
which
can
be
withdrawn
later.
it
is
implicit
in
the
juvenile
court's
scheme
that
noncriminal
treatment
is
to
be
the
rule
for
the
adult
criminal
treatment,
the
exception
which
must
be
governed
by
the
particular
factors
of
individual
cases.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
yes
sir.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
yes.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
as
a
statutory
right.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
yes
sir.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
yes
sir.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
i
have
to
say,
it's
attached
in
this
conflict.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
no
sir.
no.
now,
finally,
i
want
to
say
to
the
court
in
the
panel
contention
that
if
in
the
cases
decided
by
this
court,
white
against
maryland,
hamilton
versus
alabama,
which
were
decided
on
the
need
of
counsel
at
critical
stage
in
criminal
proceedings
--
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
yes
sir.
but
whether
the
constitutional
law
or
otherwise,
it
was
necessary
in
the
case
of
an
adult
or
adults,
we
say
it
is
all
the
more
necessary
in
the
cases
of
indigent
juvenile,
16
years
old
or
on.
and
we
say
further,
that
it
is
a
constitutional
proposition,
if
investigating
in
gideon
against
wainwright,
was
entitled
to
a
counsel
in
that
case,
we
say
the
accused
in
this
case
is
and
was
entitled
to
counsel
at
every
stage
of
the
proceeding.
and
we
are
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
many
courts
have
indicated
that
the
juvenile
court
is
not
a
criminal
court.
now,
whatever
they
say
about
it,
whether
or
not
it
is
a
criminal
court,
the
fact
does
remain
that
in
this
case
whether
you
call
it
a
criminal
court
or
not
a
criminal
court,
the
result
of
that
action
was
that
the
accused,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
received
the
equivalent
of
two
life
sentences,
and
we
urge
a
reversal
on
all
the
ground
alleged
in
our
petition
and
in
our
brief.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
yes
sir.
well,
not
from
first
to
last.
he
had
counsel
in
district
court
in
that
trial.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
but
it
was
further,
mr.
justice,
the
result
of
the
waiver
in
this
case
--
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
--
they
can't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
what
if
there
were
not?
then
i
suspect
he
would
have
to
be
tried
as
an
adult.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
that's
what
happened
to
him.
but
he
was
entitled
not
to
be
tried
as
an
adult
except
under
certain
circumstances
when
he
was
16
years
of
age
for
having
committed
an
offense
when
he
was
16
years
of
age.
he
was
entitled
not
to
be
tried
as
an
adult.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
in
statutory.
the
--
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
yes,
after
full
investigation.
mr.
myron
g.
ehrlich
and
we
say
that
the
investigation
was
not
full,
that
he
did
not
received
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
and
was
not
permitted
to
receive
it.
