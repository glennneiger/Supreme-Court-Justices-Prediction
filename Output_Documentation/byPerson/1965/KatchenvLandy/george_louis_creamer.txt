mr.
george
louis
creamer
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
counsel
has
mentioned
that
the
issues
in
this
case
are
narrow
and
they
are
in
the
sense
that
factually
it
is
uncomplicated
narrow.
they
are
broad
in
a
legal
sense
in
that
fundamentally,
what
is
involved
in
the
case
seems
to
be
the
very
foundation
and
fundamental
of
bankruptcy
law
and
bankruptcy
administration.
mr.
winner
has
summarized
it
quite
accurately.
i
think
the
facts
about
which
there
is
no
dispute
and
thus
the
court
has
doubtless
noticed
from
a
record
that
there
is
almost
no
factual
problem
presented
by
the
record.
three
claims,
two
of
them
effectively
the
same
were
allowed
two
different
payments
to
one
bank.
and
a
third
claim
which
was
a
similar
payment
to
another
bank
were
allowed
as
preferences;
fourth,
which
was
a
stock
matter
was
not
permitted
by
the
circuit.
now,
we
certainly
do
have
very
clearly
involved
here
of
the
problem
of
alexander
versus
hillman.
it
is
categorical.
alexander
versus
hillman
came
out
from
the
fourth
circuit.
it
is
a
receivership
case.
it
is
a
receivership
case
which
has
this
great
cogency
to
bankruptcy
we
believe
as
a
receivership
case
well
might
have
or
as
any
case
might
have
of
what
the
court
said
which
is
cogent
in
hillman
applies
to
bankruptcy
quite
as
much
as
it
applies
to
the
receivership
situation.
all
that
had
occurred
was
that
there
–
was
a
receiver
having
the
assets
of
an
insolvent
person
in
hand.
other
persons,
who
were
debtors
or
might
have
been,
made
the
application
to
share
in
the
receivership
assets.
it
was
held
that
having
made
application
to
the
receiver
to
share
in
those
assets
claims
with
the
receiver.
the
receiver
had
a
right
to
offset
or
to
counterclaim
on
other
claims
that
might
be
held
against
the
particular
persons
making
the
claim
and
the
court
simply
said
and
i
think
we
quote
hillman
at
11
of
the
brief,
of
our
brief.
respondent's
contention
means
that
while
they
invoke
in
the
court's
jurisdiction
to
establish
their
right
to
participate
in
distribution,
they
may
deny
its
power
to
require
them
to
account
for
what
they
misappropriated.
in
behalf
of
creditors
and
stockholders,
the
receivers
reasonably
may
insist
that
before
taking
out
respondents
made
by
the
receivership
of
the
court
be
required
to
make
restitution.
the
requirement
is
in
harmony
with
the
rule
generally
followed
by
the
courts
of
equity
that
having
jurisdiction
of
the
parties
to
controversies
brought
before
them.
they
will
decide
all
matters
in
dispute
and
to
create
a
complete
relief.
distribution
may
not
be
made
without
decisions
of
the
counterclaims.
nothing
is
marked
there.
they
are
part
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
main
suit
than
recovery
that
all
through
there
is
belongs.
i
think
that
is
probably
the
essence
of
hillman.
now,
the
problem
is,
does
that
apply
in
bankruptcy?
counsel
says,
that
it
is
alleged
and
stated
by
the
court
in
other
cases
that
there
is
a
jury
right
with
reference
to
the
recovery
of
a
preference.
what
counsel
that
does
not
do
is
to
draw
the
distinction
of
that
such
a
case
is
a
case
in
which
there
has
not
been
a
claim
made
in
bankruptcy.
the
case
is
not
pending
in
bankruptcy
upon
a
claim
of
the
claimant.
it
is
one
of
those
situations
in
which
the
trustee
having
such
assets
as
would
be
assets
of
the
bankrupt
state
may
go
out
as
a
party
into
other
parts
and
bring
an
ordinary
action.
he
might
bring
an
action
i
presume
in
tort
and
might
frequently
do
and
such
a
tort
action
would
not
be
an
action
in
bankruptcy
but
a
declaration
that
it
was
not,
would
not
have
anything
to
do
with
a
claim
made
in
bankruptcy.
there
perhaps
also
is
an
off
discussion
of
the
issue
by
a
reference
to
the
summary
jurisdiction
in
bankruptcy.
bankruptcy
is
a
kind
of
thing
that
is
sui
generis.
it
is
not
legal
jurisdiction,
while
legal
jurisdiction
it
is
an
equitable
jurisdiction.
now
the
court
has
said
it
applies
basically
equitable
principles.
it
is
an
extremely
broad
jurisdiction
to
meet
a
specific
type
of
the
recurrent
and
critical
economic
problem
which
obviously
has
its
origins
in
constitutional
power
in
exactly
the
same
fashion
the
seventh
amendment
guarantee
has
and
the
power
this
court
has
said
is
a
---
rather
plenary
power
vested
in
the
congress
over
the
whole
subject
of
bankruptcies
and
then
the
court
has
defined
subject
to
bankruptcies
extremely
broadly.
now,
the
statute
says
specifically
section
2a-7
of
the
act
through
11a-7
u.s.c
that
the
courts
of
the
united
states
are
hereby
invested
with
such
jurisdiction
to
pause
the
stage
of
the
bankrupt
to
be
collected,
reduce
the
money
distributed
and
determine
controversies
in
relation
thereto.
now,
what
are
the
basic
types
of
controversies?
well,
the
essential
controversy
in
bankruptcy
is
who
gets
the
money
that
usually
it's
what
occurs
and
the
way
you
determine
it
is
that
the
claimants
file
their
claims.
each
claim
filed
in
bankruptcy
for
every
practical
purpose
is
simply
a
lawsuit
instituted
against
the
trustee
by
the
claimant
asserting
that
he
has
the
right
to
part
of
whatever
is
in
the
hands
of
or
maybe
garnered
by
of
the
trustee.
if
this
is
a
lawsuit
and
it
is
a
controversy
then
we
would
submit
that
might
other
lawsuits
it
has
a
reverse
and
then
adverse,
and
the
court
trying
to
completely
adjudicate
it,
must
look
at
its
reverse
and
must
look
at
its
odd
versus
wealth.
now,
if
it
is
such
a
claim
then
certainly
counterclaims
or
set-offs
must
be
ascertained
to
determine
if
there
is
a
right
fundamentally
to
receive
anything
out
of
the
pool
of
the
assets
and
if
this
is
a
type
of
matter
applying
rules
of
equitable
cognizance
as
we
suppose
that
it
is
and
as
the
court
has
stated
repeatedly
that
it
is,
then
necessarily,
there
must
be
an
avoidance
of
circulative
litigation
in
the
matter
and
there
must
be
avoidance
or
a
determination
of
whatever
is
implicit
in
determining
the
claim.
but
how
do
you
determine
if
somebody
has
a
right
to
draw
money
out
of
the
pool
without
determining
whether
that
person
is
of
necessity
required
to
contribute
into
the
pool
out
of
which
money
maybe
drawn.
in
the
first
instance,
the
statute
says
first;
that
the
courts
of
the
united
states
have
the
right
to
settle
the
estate
of
the
bankrupt
to
collect,
reduce
the
money
distributed,
and
determine
controversies
in
the
relation
thereto.
and
the
third
section
1668
i
believe
say
that
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
court
also
to
make
determinations
of
preferences,
set-offs
and
all
of
the
rest
of
the
equitable
claims
that
may
derive.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
no.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
not
any
kind
of
whatsoever.
i
think
possibly
a
claim,
the
court
of
appeals
used
rather
a
broad
category.
it
withdrew
from
its
luther
position
and
said
that
in
the
present
circumstances
it
would
hold
to
the
rule
that
there
might
be
an
adjudication
of
set-offs
equitable
counterclaims
and
claims
in
the
nature
of
preference
or
fraudulent
allowances,
yet
stated
of
that
it
would
not
allow
claims
on
a
totally
unrelated
method.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
i
would
tend
to
think
logically,
it
might
tend
to
do
so.
i
have
rather
a
feeling
and
it
is
curious
to
express
it
so
that
that
i
[attempt
to
laughter]
–
i
would
emotionally
like
to
make
rule
of
the
circuit
as
it
has
announced
it
because
it
doesn't
seemed
to
me
that
the
matter
of
–
of
the
--
such
questions
as
to
stop
payment
are
logically
awfully
much
related
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
no
logical
to
permit
the
rule
to
those
go
far
and
of
course
luther
did
permit
it
to
go
so
far
but
the
tenth
did
not
follow
its
own
rule
in
luther.
and
though
the
current
rule
of
tenth
is
i
think
entirely
concurred
in
by
sixth
circuit
that
is
included
in
the
tenth,
none
of
them
have
gone
so
far
as
luther
except
the
tenth
itself.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
yes.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
he
must
do
so.
it's
absolutely
required
to
determine
it.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
yes,
that
seems
to
be
implicit
in
judge
philips'
decision
and
in
fact
--
mr.
george
louis
creamer
i
can
see
no
reason
why
it
wouldn't
accept
that
it
seems
to
be
conceded
every
place
that
it's
ever
argued
but
the
setoff
whatever
this
maybe
as
though
it
were
some
kind
of
anything
summarily
determinable
but
you
don't
know
what
one
is.
it
just
says,
you
can
of
course
and
it
is
i
think
–
and
submit
suspect
when
anyone
says,
of
course
but
you
can
of
course
determine
a
set-off
whatever
this
is
but
you
cannot
plenarily
determine
the
–
the
matter
of
a
preference
but
it
is
rather
like
–
like
it's
trying
to
undo
omelets
when
you
get
into
a
state
of
this
kind.
if
you
can't
determine
that
there
has
not
been
a
preference,
you
cannot
allow
the
claim.
if
you
allow
the
claim
then
you
are
allowing
something
to
be
taken
out
under
what
i
think
mr.
moore
or
professor
moore,
the
editor
of
collier
has
said,
allows
a
terrible
kind
of
logical
dichotomy
in
that
if
you
follow
the
opposite
of
this
rule,
you
allow
b
to
receive
money
from
a
when
a
in
actuality
owes
money
to
b.
and
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
–
that
generally
not
to
be
allowed.
now,
judge
philips
in
his
decent
indicates
that
there's
a
method
of
avoiding
this
and
several
other
courts
following
similar
reasoning
have.
they
have
said
that
all
of
you
need
to
do
which
i
submit
is
another
matter
of
the
same
kind
of
letter
in
generality
which
rapidly
deteriorates
into
fattitude
and
its
ponderosity
as
somebody
wants
it,
but
all
that
you
must
do
is
stay
execution
of
rights
on
the
claim
or
stay
payment
of
the
claim
until
you
bring
a
plenary
action.
but
this,
of
course,
hits
at
the
very
heart
of
what
the
problem
is
because
it
means
that
in
every
single
case
of
bankruptcy
and
in
a
major
bankruptcy,
there
maybe
several
hundred
claims
sometimes
many
thousands
but
several
hundred
is
not
unusual
then
you
must
go
into
a
--
an
investigation
in
plenary
suit
of
all
these
matters
in
each
claim
holding
the
entire
administration
of
bankruptcy
in
suspense
until
such
time
as
you
contemplate
the
entire
plenary
operation
which
effectively
means
that
the
entire
bankrupt
of
the
state
must
be
dissipated
and
will
be.
and
that
the
fundamental
function
restorative
and
distributive
of
bankruptcy
has
to
be
eliminated.
there
–
there
is
underlying
all
of
this
a
notion
that
the
summary
jurisdiction
is
something
sinister.
well
the
summary
jurisdiction
isn't
anything
sinister
at
all.
the
bankruptcy
court
is
the
course
district
court
or
is
in
personnel
identical
with
the
district
court
of
the
united
states.
but
this
court
has
pointed
out
frequently
that
it
is
merely
because
the
united
states
judge
is
a
judge
in
bankruptcy
having
the
right
to
refer
matters
to
referees
and
also
having
the
right
i
presume
to
people.
now
the
matter
in
bankruptcy
for
summary
jurisdiction
then
is
the
basic
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court
to
administer
a
system
of
law
which
is
sui
generis
highly
emulative
and
palliative
in
its
nature
and
intended
primarily
in
the
states
as
distinguished
from
england
to
be
restorative
in
its
effect
and
certainly
having
a
tremendously
significant
basic
economic
function
and
modality
of
operation.
if
it
is
necessary
to
say
that
every
action
where
there
maybe
thought
to
be
involved
a
claim
for
a
preference
must
involve
a
plenary
action
in
a
--
another
court
then
bankruptcy
of
itself
must
grind
to
a
rather
dreadful
halt
and
that
what
is
it
is
what
i
would
submit
is
involved
here.
it
is
really
what
most
of
the
writers
have
stated.
now
the
conclusions
as
to
the
hillman
application
to
the
bankruptcy
situation
were
drawn
first
in
florance
against
kresge
which
was
asserted
which
was
reversed
in
hillman.
and
all
that
the
fourth
circuit
said
was,
“we
were
mistaken
in
the
receivership
case
according
to
the
supreme
court
only
a
short
while
ago.
therefore,
we
will
take
the
opposite
tax
in
bankruptcy
and
assume
that
there
being
the
same
economic
and
functional
purpose
accomplished,
the
court
means
as
essentially
to
follow
the
same
rule
and
this
has
been
done.
now
through
the
larger
number
of
circuits
the
fourth
developed
the
rule
most
completely,
the
second
has
followed
it,
the
third
has
followed
it,
the
eighth,
ninth
and
tenth
have
all
followed
it.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
yet
on
the
basis
of
permissive
and
compulsory
counterclaim,
i
reject
it
entirely.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
because
i
don't
think
it
has
any
particular
applicability.
permissive
and
compulsory
counterclaim
is
an
argument
that
has
been
made
by
analogy
to
the
classification
of
claims
under
rule
13
and--
mr.
george
louis
creamer
there
isn't
anything
inconsistent
at
all.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
except
but
i
don't
think
you
need
to
import
rule
13
into
the
matter.
it
--
mr.
george
louis
creamer
where
they're
applicable
or
where
they
can
logically
be
made
to
fit
in
any
of
that.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
i'm
sorry.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
as
near
as
maybe
right.
and
there
certainly
is
nothing
wrong
with
arguing
the
logic
of
the
matter.
and
if
one
wants
to
take
the
logic
of
the
matter
where
it
goes,
then
i
presume
either
a
permissive
or
a
compulsory
counterclaim
is
allowable.
the
court
has
tried
to
be
guarded;
the
tenth
circuit
has
particularly
done
so
maybe
it's
more
guarded
than
it
needs
to
be
in
these
circumstances.
i
think
that
it
is
clearly
correct
in
what
it
has
allowed
perhaps
it
might
have
allowed
more
than
it
did.
but
it
certainly
would
seem
to
clear
that
once
the
party
who
is
a
claimant
makes
an
election
to
come
into
a
bankruptcy
court
and
start
a
suit
effectively
against
the
trustee,
then
he
must
be
prepared
to
defend
against
the
trustee
and
that
this
is
certainly
a
different
situation
from
one
in
which
he
does
not
come
into
bankruptcy
but
the
trustee
as
a
suitor
goes
into
a
federal
court
or
a
state
court
to
get
an
asset
in
the
same
manner
which
somebody
else
might
have
gotten
one
had
the
bankruptcy
not
occur.
in
this
regard,
we
--
we
get
into
the
problem
of
a
jury
question.
i
think
that
the
question
judge
brennan
asked
in
colorado
certainly
does
have
pertinence.
it
is
asserted
that
there
is
a
right
to
the
jury
trial
here.
and
again
right
i
guess
is
in
the
ethical,
philosophical
sense
rather
than
a
legal
sense
because
it
is
in
assertion
of
what
–
what
the
person
asserting
at
things
ought
to
be
the
case
which
is
always
one
must
predicate
of
a
right.
but
what
the
constitution
says
relative
to
the
matter
is
simply
that
the
right
to
jury
trial
in
actions
at
common
law
shall
be
preserved.
now
it
doesn't
go
out
guarded
for
a
battle
to
create
such
a
right
where
there
isn't
one.
and
in
the
situation
of
accounting
marshaling
of
assets
and
complex
economic
cost
data
of
this
type,
the
jury
has
not
been
thought
to
be
in
many
cases
indispensable
and
in
others
has
been
thought
to
be
downright
futile.
in
any
case
colorado
under
the
authority
a
counsel
cites
has
long
recognized
that
there
is
no
summary
right
to
jury
trial
and
that
in
a
matter
of
accounting
actions
and
the
like
probably
there
isn't
any
at
all
even
when
it
is
demanded.
now
if
the
plenary
action
which
is
said
to
be
the
remedy
were
brought,
the
trustee
would
have
a
right
to
pursue
it
either
in
the
federal
courts
or
in
the
state
court;
it
would
then
be
asserted,
i
take
it,
that
there
is
some
kind
of
a
state
court
right
under
the
seventh
amendment
which
would
be
very
oblique
to
a
jury
trial
in
which
the
state
court
has
stated
the
there
isn't
one
even
not
derivative
from
bankruptcy
and
in
an
ordinary
state
matter
or
it
would
have
to
be
asserted
that
if
the
referee
had
made
this
choice,
something
pejorative
in
here
did
in
choosing
to
use
the
state
court
has
the
jurisdictional
for
him
where
–
where
he
has
an
absolute
right
under
the
federal
statute
so
to
do
and
where
the
congress
had
the
right
under
the
constitutional
provision
to
allow
him
so
to
do.
and
if
that
is
the
argument
that
would
be
made
then
you
get
that
–
that
to
be
exact
that
there
is
a
kind
to
be
logic
implicit
in
arguing
that
allowing
the
–
the
trustee
to
assert
a
counterclaim
when
he
as
himself
sued,
which
counterclaim
is
merely
the
basis
on
which
he
might
have
started
a
suit
is
a
detriment
to
the
person
who
made
an
election
to
go
in
and
sue
the
referee
by
filing
--
i
mean
sue
the
trustee
by
filing
a
claim.
i
–
i
may
sound
rather
muddled.
i
hope
–
hope
not
if
–
if
that
tends
to
some
where
that
can
be
at
the
moment
but
my--
mr.
george
louis
creamer
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
in
a
colorado
state
court?
mr.
george
louis
creamer
as
a
matter
of
absolute
right?
mr.
george
louis
creamer
as
a
matter
of
procedure
it
would
not
be
necessarily
the
case,
no.
if
it
were
construed
to
be
primarily
in
the
counting
action,
i
would
think
not.
he
might
have
been
able
under
the
rule
or
entitled
under
the
rule
to
make
a
request
or
demand
for
a
jury
trial.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
but
then
we
thought
to
be
an
equitable
counterclaim
situation
or
an
equitable
accounting
action,
he
might
very
well
not
--
mr.
george
louis
creamer
he
could
request
–
mr.
george
louis
creamer
and
he
would
probably
have
gotten
it
if
they
were
no
more
than
that
involved.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
if
he
had
requested
one,
yes.
well
of
course
but
in
colorado
he
wouldn't
have
been
constitutionally
guaranteed
that
the
–
the
existing
rule
would
have
allowed
him
to
happen
and
the
similar
federal
rule
would
probably
have
permitted
him
to
have
it
if
there
were
no
complexity
otherwise
arising
factually.
the
essence
of
the
case,
i
would
submit,
is
much
as
counsel
has
submitted
it.
the
problem
that
exists
is
quite
clearly
the
problem
of
how
far
the
hillman
rule
is
to
extend
in
matters
of
bankruptcy?
how
far
the
rule
of
equity
completely
decided
issues
once
submitted
is
to
extend,
and
whether
or
not
there
is
anything
pejorative
in
the
theory
that
once
a
claimant
submits
himself
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court
by
making
a
claim
counterclaims
maybe
offset
against
him.
now
if
there
maybe
a
set-off
and
everyone
agrees
that
there
maybe
that
as
i
say
whatever
a
set-off
is,
if
there
maybe
a
set-off
of
the
claim
then
in
logic
and
in
law
there
can
be
no
reason
why
there
cannot
be
an
adjudication
of
the
totality
of
the
counterclaim.
it
has
been
said
in
fact
sometimes
that
if
there
maybe
a
set-off
and
a
setting
off
of
the
amount,
then
there
is
probably
even
a
basis
on
which
should
argue
that
this
constituted
res
judicata
of
all
of
the
issues
in
the
plenary
suit
if
the
plenary
suit
was
brought.
no
everybody
--
mr.
george
louis
creamer
yes
quite
a
number
of
the
circuits
do,
they're
all
detailed.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
correct.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
would
allow
to
set-off
as
well
in
some
of
those
which
would
not
allow
some
of
them
specific,
as
in
the
fifth
and
seventh
said
that
there
maybe
a
set-off
but
it's
dicta
language
i
think
in
the
fifth
and
seventh.
they
do
comment
that
there
maybe
a
set-off
and
then
they
comment
that
there
may
not
be
unrelated
matters--
mr.
george
louis
creamer
i
think
that's
true.
i
have
to
assert
so
because
taking
to
gather
section
11
and
section
68,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
separate--
mr.
george
louis
creamer
i
don't
think
it's
a
really
logical
basis
for
determining
it.
it
bothers
me
as
an
assertion
of
legal
principle.
i
think
that
the
basic
equitable
right
coupled
with
what
is
statutorily
required
to
be
done
under
the
bankruptcy
act
is
a
much
better
basis
for
reaching
the
problem.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
fraudulent
liens
and
transfer
--
mr.
george
louis
creamer
it
treats
them
exactly
as
it
treats
the
preferences.
and
i
--
i
would
treat
them
the
same
way
on
a
basis
of
feeling
of
propriety
on
the
assumption
that
the
same
reasons
underlying
the
reclamation
of
a
set-off
underlie
the
reclamation
of
a
fraudulent
transfer.
it
is
a
marshaling
in
principle
being
applied
to
the
distribution
of
assets
and
in
order
to
apply
marshaling
you
have
to
get
back
the
assets
improperly
put
out
whether
it
was
fraudulently
so
or
simply
by
time
preference.
mr.
george
louis
creamer
it
might
very
well
follow
and
would
follow
from
the
language
of
tenth
that
that
would
be
adjudicable.
i
don't
know
just
why
the
secured
creditor
in
such
circumstances
would
file
but
if
he
chose
so
to
do,
he
is
a
litigant
coming
into
court
and
i
presume,
having
opted
for
that
choice
would
be
under
the
necessity
of
taking
whatever
result
is
followed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
think
there
is
there
that
there
would
be
more
submission
i
can
make
on
the
question
except
that
with
counsel,
i
would
concur
that
it
is
a
pretty
clear
kind
of
problem
which
does
require
resolution.
we
thank,
your
honors,
for
your
attention.
