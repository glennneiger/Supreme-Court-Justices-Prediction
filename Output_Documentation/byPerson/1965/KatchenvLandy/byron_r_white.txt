justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
winner,
this
is
not
a
strange
in
the
bankruptcy
act,
how
about
a
set-off?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
grant
you
it
is
specifically
covered
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
i'm
just
saying
the
bankruptcy
act
does
[inaudible]
subject
creditor
who
risk
with
the
set-off
without
any
kind
of
a
trial
you're
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
extent
--
under
the
extent
that
a
set-off
would
be
involved
here
--
into
that
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
because
the
amount
claimed
by
the
creditor
is
larger
than
his
claim
as
applied?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
set-off
in
the
rise
for
preference?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
trustee
could
make
the
claim
with
a
set-off
and
a
preference?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
that
preference
has
to
be
determined
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
he
base
it
on
a
debt
owed
by
the
creditor
of
the
bank?
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly
he
can.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
before
that
you
have
to
find
--
you
have
to
adjudicate
the
debt
[inaudible]
in
a
summary
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
normally
a
jury
trial
would
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
creamer,
you
have
gone
much
farther
than
the
court
of
appeals
i
take
it
that
the
bankruptcy
of
the
court
jurisdiction
over
any
kind
of
the
claim
whatsoever
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
against
the
creditor
who
files
a
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
your
argument
was
under
jurisdiction
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
creamer,
i
–
i
–
doesn't
the
bankruptcy
act
provide
that
a
claim
may
not
be
allowed
if
a
creditor
has
received
the
preference?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
–
is
one
of
the
obligations
of
the
court
or
the
referee
and
the
trustee
to
determine
whether
this
received
the
preference
before
the
claims
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
the
–
was
–
was
the
dissent
below
suggesting
that
in
order
to
disavow
a
claim
based
on
the
receiver
of
the
preference,
a
trustee
must
file
a
plenary
suit
somewhere
to
have
it
determined?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
was
saying
–
i
would
think
the
same
would
be
true
of
a
setoff?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
you
would
–
do
you
or
don't
you
reject
the
distinction
between
so-called
related
and
unrelated
counterclaims
--
that
permissive
or
compulsory
counterclaim?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what's
inconsistent
between
rule
13
in
the
bankruptcy
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
why
wouldn't
–
well
why
wouldn't
they
apply
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
the
general
order
37
say
that
the
rules
do
apply
where--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
do
you
have
any
case
that
indicates
a
set-off
maybe
predicated
on
a
preference?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
of
the
ones
–
all
of
the
ones
which
would
allow
a
preference
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
a
counterclaim
one
of
the
preferences
would
this
set-off--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
take
it
that
you
would
say
that
forever
there's
a
preference
a
trustee
may
assert
against
the
–
against
the
claimant
that
the
summary
jurisdiction
reaches
the
determination
of
that
preference
when
it's
asserted
by
the
trustee
no
matter
what
the
preference
relates
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
are
right
then
the
permissive
compulsory
thing
just
won't
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
–
how
about
fraudulent
liens
and
transfer
and
things
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
in
court
of
appeals
apparently
would
also
let
the
assertiveness
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
a
secured
creditor
asks
to
file
a
claim
in
bankruptcy
which
he
may
not
do
but
what
if
he
does
and
the
trustee
says,
“look
your
lien
is
no
good
against
me.
you
didn't
file
it
on
the
right
day
or
something
else
wrong
with
it.
and
consequently,
i
want
the
property.
you've
taken
–
that
you've
taken
possession
of
property
now,
i
want
it.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we're
really
talking
about
the
district
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever
you're
talking
about
that
district
judge
at
summary
jurisdiction
that's
not
been
created.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
some
of
us
think
–
justice
byron
r.
white
their
summary
out
there.
