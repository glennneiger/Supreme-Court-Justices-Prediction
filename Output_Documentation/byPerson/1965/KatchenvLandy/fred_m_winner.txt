mr.
fred
m.
winner
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
fred
m.
winner
–
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
today
on
a
very
narrow
question.
it
is
a
question
having
to
do
with
the
summary
jurisdiction
of
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
and
involved
in
the
question
is
the
problem
of
whether
the
seventh
amendment
prevents
the
exercise
of
summary
jurisdiction
by
a
referee
in
bankruptcy
where
if
a
plenary
action
were
filed
a
jury
trial
would
be
available.
we
are
before
the
court
on
a
question
as
to
which
there
is
difference
of
opinion
among
the
circuits
as
to
the
extent
of
the
summary
jurisdiction
which
a
referee
in
bankruptcy
has
or
attempts
to
exercise.
the
tenth
circuit
probably
goes
farther
than
any
other
circuit
in
its
recognition
of
summary
jurisdiction
and
it
holds
if
i
correctly
understand
the
most
recent
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
that
summary
--
that
in
an
instance
where
a
creditor
files
a
claim
in
a
bankruptcy
estate
and
where
the
trustee
seeks
to
assert
a
preference
by
way
of
counterclaim
back
against
that
creditor,
the
tenth
circuit
apparently
go
host
that
the
summary
jurisdiction
does
exist
if
the
counterclaim
is
either
compulsory
or
permissive
or
would
be
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
if
a
preference
or
one
or
two
other
things
are
involved
and
if
the
matter
is
not
wholly
unrelated
to
the
claim
initially
filed
by
the
creditor.
mr.
fred
m.
winner
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
winner
yes
sir
in
the
katchen
case,
yes
sir.
i
read
the
katchen
case
to
modify
an
earlier
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
interstate,
but
i
believe
or
i
hope
i
have
correctly
summarized
katchen
as
decided
by
the
tenth
circuit.
i
think
that
perhaps
the
problem
can
be
best
illustrated
by
a
very
brief
recitation
of
the
facts
here.
here
a
corporation
was
formed
in
april
1960
which
had
the
name
of
katchen's
bonus
corner
incorporated.
contemporaneously
with
the
formation
of
the
corporation,
louis
katchen,
the
principle
stockholder
borrowed
$40,000.00
from
the
american
national
bank.
now
in
fact,
the
note
was
signed
by
katchen's
bonus
corner
incorporated
and
louis
katchen
was
the
accommodation
maker.
a
few
months
later,
$10,000.00
was
borrowed
from
the
north
denver
bank.
not
very
long
thereafter,
they
had
a
disastrous
fire
which
was
uninsured.
within
four
months
of
the
date
of
bankruptcy,
the
corporation
caused
first
$15,000.00
and
later
an
additional
of
$10,000.00
to
be
paid
on
the
american
national
bank
loan
on
which
louis
katchen
was
an
accommodation
maker
and
did
also
cause
to
be
paid
in
full
the
note
to
the
north
denver
bank
on
which
katchen
was
an
accommodation
maker.
subsequent
to
that
and
prior
to
bankruptcy,
but
all
within
the
four
months,
katchen
paid
personally
an
additional
$5,000.00
on
the
american
national
bank
note.
following
bankruptcy,
katchen
filed
a
claim
as
a
creditor
of
the
bankrupt
corporation
for
the
last
$5,000.00
i
have
mentioned,
that
is
the
$5,000.00
which
he
paid
personally
on
the
note
and
he
filed
a
claim
for
approximately
$4,500.00
worth
of
rent
said
to
be
due
him
by
the
corporation
on
real
property
he
personally
owned.
the
trustee
then
asserted
four
counterclaims.
the
four
counterclaims
were
these;
the
first
two
involved
the
payments,
the
payments
which
had
been
made
by
the
corporation
on
the
american
national
bank
note.
the
third
one
involved
the
payment
made
by
the
corporation
on
the
north
denver
bank
note
and
the
fourth
one
involved
a
claim
which
--
in
which
the
trustee
said
that
louis
katchen
had
failed
to
subscribe
for
his
initial
capital
stock.
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
the
claim
on
the
failure
to
subscribe
for
the
capital
stock
was
wholly
unrelated
to
katchen's
claims
and
therefore,
the
trustee
could
not
exercise
summary
jurisdiction
over
it.
but
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
the
referee
could
exercise
summary
jurisdiction
as
to
the
three
payments
made
by
corporate
funds
on
the
notes.
it
is
undisputed
that
katchen
objected
to
the
summary
jurisdiction
at
the
first
available
opportunity
and
as
i
have
said
the
question
we
have
here
today
is,
can
a
referee
in
bankruptcy
exercise
that
summary
jurisdiction?
now
as
we
view
it,
the
various
circuits
which
have
passed
on
the
question
and
some
of
them
saying
they
can
exercise
of
just
compulsory
counterclaims
some
on
permissive
and
some
on
--
or
some
on
both
permissive
and
counterclaim,
an
attempt
seems
to
go
all
from
a
slightly
different
tension
--
mr.
fred
m.
winner
i
think
not
sir.
in
their
full
extent
that's
what
i
mean.
mr.
fred
m.
winner
in
their
full
scope
i
think
not.
mr.
fred
m.
winner
yes
sir.
the
interstate
case
out
of
the
tenth
circuit
specifically
made
reference
to
rules
13
(a)
and
(b)
the
permissive
and
the
compulsory
counterclaim
rules
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
the
seem
to
key
it
into
that.
but
i
don't
understand
exactly
how
it
keys
in
other
than
its
--
the
circuit
did
do
it.
mr.
fred
m.
winner
yes
sir,
they
applied
that
test.
mr.
fred
m.
winner
i
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
i
think
clearly
it
is.
i
think
that
all
of
the
circuits
in
arriving
at
their
--
in
arriving
at
their
results
have
fundamentally
relied
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
in
alexander
against
hillman
and
they
read
alexander
against
hillman
in
the
way
that
i
just
simply
cannot
read
it.
alexander
against
hillman
was
not
a
bankruptcy
matter.
alexander
against
hillman
was
an
equity
receivership.
in
alexander
against
hillman
after
the
receivership
was
started
to
wind
up
the
affairs
of
the
corporation,
some
of
the
corporate
officers
filed
a
claim
in
the
receivership.
the
receiver
filed
equitable
counterclaims
against
the
corporate
officer
and
this
court
held
that
equity
having
assumed
jurisdiction
it
would
certainly
exercise
jurisdiction
as
to
all
equitable
matters
and
the
matter
came
up
primarily
as
a
question
of
venue.
it
said
that
venue
had
been
consented
to
and
it
held
that
in
an
equity
receivership
as
to
equitable
counterclaims,
the
court
did
have
jurisdiction.
but
there
are
these
distinctions
between
alexander
against
hillman
and
the
summary
jurisdiction
which
is
attempted
to
be
exercised
by
a
bankruptcy
referee.
first
is
the
most
obvious
distinction.
an
equitable
receivership
is
not
bankruptcy.
second
is
the
second
most
obvious
distinction.
in
alexander
against
hillman,
the
jurisdiction
was
exercised
as
to
equitable
counterclaims,
but
in
the
case
today
before
the
court,
the
counterclaims
are
not
equitable,
they
are
legal.
they
are
counterclaims
for
money
had
and
received.
and
if
the
plenary
action
had
been
filed
and
clearly
it
could
have
been,
a
jury
could
have
been
demanded.
the
next
distinction
as
i
mentioned
is
that
alexander
against
hillman,
as
we
understand
the
case,
involved
only
and
completely
the
equitable
issues
coupled
with
the
venue
problem.
that
i
think
is
a
distinction
which
cannot
be
said
to
exist
here.
here
we
have,
as
i
have
said,
then
counterclaims
involving
legal
issues
as
to
which
a
jury
trial
could
be
demanded.
and
we
think
that
has
been
settled
and
settled
by
this
court
and
i
make
mention
of
schoenthal
versus
irving
trust,
this
in
an
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
butler
in
1932.
there,
there
was
a
plenary
action
filed
to
recover
a
preference.
here
clearly,
a
plenary
action
could
have
been
filed.
there
the
case
was
assigned
in
the
district
court
to
the
equity
side
of
the
court.
a
demand
was
made
for
a
jury.
this
court
held
as
to
an
identical
type
of
preference
that
the
preference
claim
was
an
action
for
money
had
and
received
that
it
was
error
to
hear
the
case
on
the
equity
side
of
the
court
and
that
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
a
jury.
we
cannot
distinguish
that
case.
the
only
thing
that
can
be
done
as
we
see
it
to
get
around
that
case
is
to
say
that
alexander
against
hillman
overruled
it,
but
alexander
against
hillman
was
written
only
three
years
after
the
schoenthal
case.
it
was
again
written
by
mr.
justice
butler
and
makes
no
mention
of
the
schoenthal
case.
we
submit
that
alexander
against
hillman
does
not
stand
in
anyway
for
the
propositions
for
which
it
has
been
cited
by
the
circuits.
as
is
pointed
out
in
daniel
against
guaranty
trust
once
more
written
in
1932,
this
time
by
mr.
justice
mcreynolds.
there
the
strict
question
of
preference
was
not
involved.
guaranty
trust
within
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
had
filed
a
reclamation
of
certain
bonds
and
the
trustee
filed
a
counterclaim
against
guaranty
trust
and
in
that
counterclaim
asked
to
recover
money
which
the
trustee
said
guaranty
trust
had
received
after
the
bankruptcy
adjudication.
this
court
there
pointed
out
that
to
put
upon
a
creditor
almost,
well,
this
isn't
the
court's
language
of
course,
but
to
put
on
upon
a
creditor
almost
the
problem
of
russian
roulette,
when
you
file
a
claim
in
a
bankruptcy,
the
court
would
be
completely
unfair
that
the
argument
which
is
made
in
some
of
the
circuit
court
opinions
that
anybody
who
files
a
lawsuit
is
subjected
to
the
hazard
of
a
counterclaim
that
that
argument
does
not
apply.
sure,
you're
always
subjected
to
the
hazards
of
a
counterclaim,
but
you're
subjected
to
the
hazards
of
a
counterclaim
in
a
court
where
all
of
the
orderly
processes
of
the
court
should
apply.
and
to
say
that
a
creditor
who
by
exercising
is
very,
very
lawful
right
of
seeking
to
recover
his
portion
of
a
debt
out
of
a
bankruptcy
estate
must
then
subject
himself
to
the
risk
of
a
counterclaim
based
upon
a
preference
without
the
protections
of
a
full
trial
in
a
plenary
action
is
to
make
the
filing
of
a
claim
in
a
bankruptcy
estate
a
matter
of
serious
risk.
mr.
fred
m.
winner
set-off
is
specifically
covered
i
think,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
m.
winner
preferences
as
in
the
same
claim--
mr.
fred
m.
winner
that
i
cannot
question
but
the
bankruptcy
act
does
not
do
that--
mr.
fred
m.
winner
if
it
had
been
a
set-off,
yes,
but
that
isn't
the
contention
here.
mr.
fred
m.
winner
yes,
but
here
is
something
that
think
your
honor
--
mr.
fred
m.
winner
sir?
i
didn't
hear
you
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
winner
i
doubt
it.
mr.
fred
m.
winner
yes
sir.
let
me
--
mr.
fred
m.
winner
yes.
mr.
fred
m.
winner
certainly
he
can.
mr.
fred
m.
winner
let
me
point
out,
your
honor
--
mr.
fred
m.
winner
more
important,
your
honor
--
there's
something
i
think
your
honor
is
overlooking.
your
honor
is,
i
think
inherent
in
what
your
honor
says
is
the
thought
that
the
determination
of
a
preference
is
a
part
of
a
bankruptcy
proceedings.
now
if
that
is
what
your
honor
is
saying,
your
honor
is
in
complete
disagreement
with
schoenthal
versus
irving
trust
which
i
have
mentioned
before
and
which
expressly
holds
that,
and
this
happens
to
be
a
quote
“suits
to
recover
preferences
constitute
no
part
of
the
proceedings
in
bankruptcy
but
concerned
controversies
arising
out
of
it.”
now
if
the
determination
of
a
preference
constitutes
no
part
of
the
bank
--
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
that
concerns
controversies
arising
out
of
it,
i
submit
your
honor,
that
you
cannot
deprive
them
of
a
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
simply
at
the
whim
of
the
trustee
by
electing
to
counterclaim
within
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
the
exercise
of
summary
jurisdiction
or
electing
to
proceed
by
plenary
action
and
most
assuredly
--
mr.
fred
m.
winner
under
the
present
statute
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
winner
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
have
been
dreading
that
question
like
the
question
[inaudible]
[attempt
to
laughter]
under
parker
against
clinton
which
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
colorado,
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
held
many
years
ago
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
colorado.
colorado
lawyers
are
aware
of
that
case.
let
me
add
that
i
think
if
i
correctly
read
many
of
the
recent
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
that
since
the
first
10
amendments
are
becoming
rapidly
or
totally
incorporated
into
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
suggest
that
perhaps
this
court
has
effectively
overruled
parker
against
clinton.
and
so
that
--
mr.
fred
m.
winner
no
sir,
i've
been
saving
–
mr.
fred
m.
winner
i've
been
saving
that
one
and
nobody
has
suggested
that
yet
but
i
think
that
is
probably
the
logical
conclusion
which
must
follow
--
mr.
fred
m.
winner
no
sir,
i
couldn't
get
that
into
this
case.
i
couldn't
think
of
a
way
to
do
it.
but
i
do
think
we
have
in
this
case
a
very
squarely
whether
you
can
deprive
the
man
of
a
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
i
suggest
this.
i
suggest
that
it
is
most
difficult
to
interpret
the
bankruptcy
statute
and
the
bankruptcy
proceedings
in
a
way
that
would
deprive
a
man
of
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
under
these
circumstances
and
still
adhere
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
dairy
queen
which
of
course
came
up
long
after
the
schoenthal
the
dan
–
and
the
daniel
cases.
but
in
dairy
queen,
it
was
so
clearly
pointed
out
by
this
court
that
the
mandate
of
the
rules,
that
the
rules
are
not
intended
to
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
–
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
it
was
so
clearly
pointed
out
that
where
both
legal
and
equitable
issues
are
present
in
the
case,
you
can't
deny
a
man
of
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
by
simply
deciding
the
equitable
issues
first.
thank
you.
mr.
fred
m.
winner
the
court
please,
justice
white's
last
question
has
been
expressly
answered
by
this
court.
it
was
answered
in
taubel-scott-kitzmiller
versus
fox.
in
that
case
--
mr.
fred
m.
winner
sir?
mr.
fred
m.
winner
taubel-scott-kitzmiller
company
versus
fox.
it
appears
that
--
the
citation
appears
at
the
bottom
of
page
11
of
our
opening
brief.
in
that
case,
justice
brandeis
said
that
there
the
argument
was
advanced
that
since
the
bankruptcy
court
was
empowered
to
order
that
a
lien
void
is
against
the
trustee
should
be
preserved,
that
because
of
that,
the
argument
was
advanced,
that
there
were
some
jurisdiction.
that
argument
was
rejected
and
the
opinion
said
the
argument
precedes
upon
a
misapprehension
of
the
nature
and
purpose
of
the
clause
in
question.
it
does
not
confer
jurisdiction.
it
confers
substantive
and
adjective
rights,
which
i
think,
it
answers
the
question
as
to
determining
the
–
the
power
of
a
referee
in
bankruptcy
to
determine
the
validity
of
a
lien.
mr.
fred
m.
winner
here
or
--
mr.
fred
m.
winner
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
not.
i
appreciate
that
one
can
appeal
from
the
referee
and
bankruptcy
to
the
district
judge
but
one
appeal
from
the
referee
and
bankruptcy
to
the
district
judge
and
one
does
not
get
a
trial
de
novo.
mr.
fred
m.
winner
no
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
winner
yes,
sir
a
very
limited
review
and
my
experience
of
trial
before
referees
and
bankruptcy
and
i
mean
no
slurs
but
my
experience
is
that
they
differ
somewhat
--
mr.
fred
m.
winner
a
big
pardon,
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
winner
they're
--
they're
indeed
summary
and
i
say
in
conclusion,
i
do
not
think
that
you
can
condition
--
that
you
can
impose
upon
a
man
who
sees
fit
to
file
a
lawful
claim
in
a
bankruptcy
state
the
irrevocable
and
unavoidable
penalty
that
if
you
filed
this
claim,
by
way
of
a
club
held
over
your
head,
you
cannot
have
a
plenary
trial
as
to
any
claim
for
preference,
which
is
asserted
against
you.
and
if
--
if
you're
foolish
enough
to
file
this
claim
--
if
you're
foolish
enough
to
assert
your
legal
rights,
you
as
a
conditioned
founded
into
you,
waive
your
right
to
a
jury
that
we
submit
is
not
the
law
at
least
we
hope
it
is
not
the
law.
we
think
alexander
against
hillman
does
not
so
hold
and
we
think
that
to
so
hold
would
require
that
irving
trust
be
expressly
overruled.
thank
you.
