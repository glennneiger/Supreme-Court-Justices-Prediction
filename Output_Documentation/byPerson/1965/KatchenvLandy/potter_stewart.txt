justice
potter
stewart
mr.
winner
that
what
you
just
said
is
what
you
draw
from
most
recent
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you're
referring
to
a
decision
in
this
very
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
applied
in
the
proceedings
before
referee
in
bankruptcy?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
that's
what
i
meant
to
my
question
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
then
when
we
talk
about
permissive
and
compulsory
counterclaims
you
mean
claims
which
would
be
if
this
were
an
ordinary
civil
action
in
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
it
did
apply
that
test?
justice
potter
stewart
which
maybe
perfectly
proper
not
by
analogy
but
by
definition
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
do
not
in
full
force
and
in
--
apply
the
action
before
the
referee
in
bankruptcy?
