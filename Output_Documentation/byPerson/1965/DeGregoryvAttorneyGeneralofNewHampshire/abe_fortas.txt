justice
abe
fortas
was
it
'46
in
--
when
he
was
in
massachusetts?
justice
abe
fortas
in
'46
and
more
or
less
'47.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
a
period
of
limitations
in
the
subversive
activities
act?
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
appellant
answer
all
of
those
questions
as
to
the
present
or
current
time,
all
the
questions
on
page
31?
justice
abe
fortas
but
he
made
--
he
made
no
claim
of
self-incrimination,
did
he?
justice
abe
fortas
after
--
after
the
first
degregory
case,
did
mr.
degregory
purge
himself
of
the
civil
contempt?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
was
the
formal
proceeding
in
which
he
purged
himself?
justice
abe
fortas
and
did
you
ask
him
some
questions?
justice
abe
fortas
what
justice?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
you
asked
him
whatever
questions
were
considered
pertinent
to
that
particular
investigation,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i
wish
you
would.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
did
you
go
back
administratively
and
ask
questions?
justice
abe
fortas
immediately?
justice
abe
fortas
within
two
days.
did
he
refuse
to
reply?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
happened?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
this
same
case?
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
in
that
connection.
is
it
your
position
that
you
satisfy
the
first
sentence
of
8
(a).
justice
abe
fortas
by
reason
of
the
evidence
that
you
have
that
six
and
a
half
years
prior
to
the
term
of
the
examination,
degregory
is
connected
with
communist
party
or
was
a
communist
official
or
whatever
it
might
be.
is
that
net
--
net
of
the
position?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
it
your
position
that
if
he
can
investigate
subversion
that
he
had
legal
authority
and
legal
justification
for
investigating
a
subversion
but
he
doesn't
have
to
make
any
showing
whatsoever
with
respect
to
any
particular
individual
who
is
called
to
testify?
that's
not
your
position,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
he
does
not
have
to
show
that?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
from
your
point
of
view,
that
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
degregory
was
connected
with
the
communist
party
or
not,
that
is
to
say,
if
the
attorney
general
have
general
--
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
he
is
ought
to
invest
--
he
is
authorized
to
investigate
the
communist
party,
he
could
call
anybody,
is
that
right?
the
episcopalian
minister
or
the
baptist
minister
or
the
governor
of
the
state
or
whatnot,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
was
asking
about.
justice
abe
fortas
then
you
do
agree
that
he
has
to
make
some
showing
of
probable
cause
for
inquiring
of
the
particular
witness,
that's
exactly
what
i'm
trying
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
get
in
terms
of
the
position.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
only
evidence
here,
as
i
understand
it,
is
evidence
that
degregory
was
a
communist
official
or
whatnot,
six
and
a
half
years
prior
to
the
time
that
these
questions
were
asked,
am
i
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
at
the
time
that
degregory
was
called
initially
or
later?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
your
answer.
