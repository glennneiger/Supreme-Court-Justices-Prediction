justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn't
know
that
the
court
had
ever
held
that.
i
decide--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
have
a
right
under
the
constitution,
it
can't
be
infringed
at
all,
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
have
the
full
report?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
we
had
before
us
in
uphaus.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
i
remember
reading
a
very
big
thing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
about
the
section.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
how
old
was
that
at
the
time
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
was
the
date
of
the
inquiry
in
court
not
before
the
attorney
general
in
this
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
about
nine
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
arguing
any
significance
to
your
case
and
our
decisions
last
--
it
was
last
term,
wasn't
it,
in
the
respondent
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
are
you
arguing
staleness
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
you
say
--
when
you
say
alleged
you
mean
that
there's
a
larger
report
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
those
are
--
are
they
finding
based
on
some
inquiry
of
the
attorney
general?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
findings
based
on
the
evidence
of
degregory?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
any
evidence
of
anyone
who
knew
degregory.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
that
record,
that
reference
then
is
to
the
big
red
report,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
to
this
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
you
mean,
i
gather
is,
that
the
witnesses
can
be
called
under
oath.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
the
material.
it
was
the
conclusions
with
this,
weren't
they?
if
i
recall
that,
it
seems
to
me,
i
read
that
pretty
careful
a
few
years
ago.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
they
were
in
good
deal,
largely
though?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
the
way,
what
is
the
world
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
today.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
the
same
time,
we
have
communist
problem
today
as
we
had
10
years
ago?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
suggest
that
your
legislature
doesn't
think
there's
much
of
a
danger
existing
in
new
hampshire?
