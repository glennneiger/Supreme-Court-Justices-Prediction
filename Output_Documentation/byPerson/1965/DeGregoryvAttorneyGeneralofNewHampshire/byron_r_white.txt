justice
byron
r.
white
will
you
suggest,
i
suppose,
that
the
legislature
was
entitled
to
investigate
the
communist
party
six
and
a
half
years
ago
as
the
basis
for
a
continued
investigation
of
it,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
asked
questions
having
to
do
with
six
and
a
half
years
ago.
you
must
have
thought
the
state
had
a
legitimate
interest
in
finding
out
about
the
communist
party
as
it
existed
six
and
a
half
years
ago
as
a
purview
to
finding
out
what's
happened
to
it
since
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
if
it
--
what
if
you'd
have
information
on
degregory
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
1931
and
he
had
said
that
i
have
not
been
--
you
had
information
and
he
says,
“i
have
not
been
a
member
and
i'm
not
a
member
of
the
communist
party
now
and
i
have
not
been
a
member
in
the
last
30
years.”
and
you
said
--
and
then
you
asked
him,
“were
you
a
member
in
1931?”
is
there
some
limit
to
this
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
does
that
come?
when
was
that
--
how
can
you
recognize
it
when
that
line
comes?
that
they
say,
the
--
the
petitioner
says
it's
come
already,
six
and
a
half
years
is
too
long.
you
shouldn't
have
to
--
they
shouldn't
be
entitled
to
make
inquiries
at
all
in
that
stale.
would
it
be
10
years
or
15
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
what
you
have
is
a
statement
when
he
was
a
member
six
and
a
half
years
ago?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you're
really
--
i
suppose
you're
really
trying
to
find
out
whether
you
have
a
problem
at
all
with
the
communist
party
of
new
hampshire?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
didn't
--
as
a
fact
there
for
this
question,
you
didn't
include
any
information
whatsoever
about
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
communist
party
operating
in
new
hampshire
at
the
time
the
questions
were
asked.
you
just
relied
on
an
old
report.
isn't
it
true?
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
at
the
time
you
ask
these
questions
that
are
involved
here
that
the
communist
party
wasn't
--
was
in
existence
or
had
any
activities
whatsoever
in
new
hampshire
or
even
had
any
members
there.
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
things
got
worst?
