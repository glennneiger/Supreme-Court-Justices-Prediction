why
do
you
use
the
word
cross-examine?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
was
this
a
cross-examination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wasn't
a
cross-examination.
justice

he
used

justice
hugo
l.
black
he
used
it
several
times
before
that
and
i
was
going
to
ask
you
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
do
you
mean
by
cross-examination.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
had
not
been
summoned
as
a
witness
and
put
on
the
stand
by
anybody
else,
had
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
reference
to
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
your
argument
was
awhile
ago
which
is
wrong
that
what
you
have
interested
in
was
the
self-preservation
of
new
hampshire
from
being
destroyed
and
now
you're
going
to
world
conditions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
indication
for
the
last
six
and
a
half
years
that
you
have
any
communist
in
new
hampshire
that
you
know
about
as
the
record
shows?
i'm
talking
about
new
hampshire.
justice
hugo
l.
black
pretty
hard
to
find
and
to
keep
the
job
going,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
report
last
year
about
how
many
communists
you
had
last
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
report
last
year
about
how
many
communists
you
have
been
able
to
detect
in
new
hampshire
last
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
imagine
that
it's
a
matter
of
common
knowledge,
if
you
reported
that
you're
about
to
be
overthrown
last
year
by
the
communists
and
you
have
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
we
be
able
to
assume
of
the
fact
that
nothing
has
been
done
during
this
last
six
and
a
half
years.
legislature
has
done
nothing.
the
new
hampshire
is
not
in
extreme
imperative
danger
of
being
overthrown
at
this
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
problem,
i
suppose,
was
the
basis
of
your
legal
right
to
do
this
is,
as
i
understood
you
to
say,
that
the
right
of
new
hampshire
to
preserve
itself
from
destruction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
would
we
be
have
a
right
to
assume
that
there's
no
immediate
likelihood
of
that
destruction
by
the
fact
that
you
haven't
found
anybody
and
haven't
found
the
five
witness
even
to
ask
questions
during
the
last
six
and
a
half
years.
