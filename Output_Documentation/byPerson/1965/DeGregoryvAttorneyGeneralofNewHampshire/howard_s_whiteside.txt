mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
on
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
which
affirmed
a
decision
of
the
superior
court
of
new
hampshire,
ordering
the
appellant
in
this
case
committed
to
jail
for
one
year
or
until
he
purge
himself
for
a
civil
contempt.
involved
is
a
statute
of
new
hampshire
which
is
quoted
on
page
2
of
my
brief,
chapter
588,
section
8
(a)
which
is
part
of
the
new
hampshire
subversive
activities
act.
and
the
first
sentence
says,
“at
any
time
when
the
attorney
general
has
information
which
he
deems
reasonable
or
reliable
relating
to
violations
of
the
provisions
of
this
chapter,
he
shall
make
full
and
complete
investigation
thereof
and
shall
report
to
the
general
court
for
results
of
this
investigation
together
with
his
recommendations,
if
any,
for
legislation.”
this
case
originated
in
november
of
1963.
you
recall
the
statute,
i
just
read
says,
if
the
attorney
general
has
information
--
reasonable
and
reliable
information
concerning
violations
of
the
statute.
now,
what
triggered
the
start
of
this
investigation
in
november
of
1963
was
no
new
evidence
of
subversive
activities
in
new
hampshire.
no
sudden
reappearance
of
the
communist
party
of
new
hampshire.
what
triggered
it
was
that
hugo
degregory,
the
appellant
in
this
case
came
into
the
superior
court
in
new
hampshire
and
purged
himself
of
contempt
in
a
previous
proceeding
by
answering
in
the
negative
the
question,
“are
you
presently
a
member
of
the
communist
party?”
so,
he
left
the
court
a
freeman
and
two
days
later,
the
attorney
general
issued
a
subpoena
to
have
him
appear
for
further
investigation.
i
have
referred
to
the
previous
proceeding
here.
the
new
hampshire
subversive
activities
act
was
passed
in
1951.
in
1953,
a
temporary
statute
permitting
investigation
by
the
attorney
general
was
adopted
which
not
only
provided
that
he
might
investigate
as
to
violations
of
the
chapter
but
provided
that
he
might
investigate
as
to
the
presence
of
subversive
persons
within
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
this
was
continued
in
1955.
in
1957,
the
legislature
adopted
the
present
statute
which
dropped
the
clause
about
the
presence
of
subversive
persons
in
new
hampshire
and
reads
as
i
read
it
to
this
court.
the
previous
statute
was
involved
in
the
cases
of
sweezy
versus
new
hampshire
and
wyman
versus
uphaus
both
of
which
came
to
this
court.
the
present
statute
was
involved
in
the
previous
degregory
case,
degregory
versus
the
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire
which
was
decided
without
argument
per
curiam
by
this
court,
368
u.s.
19
with
four
justices
dissenting.
now
--
and
thereby
upheld
a
new
hampshire
decision
saying
that
the
act
was
constitutional
on
its
face
and
constitutional
as
applied
to
the
facts
in
that
case.
so
as
a
result,
i
did
not
argue
below
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face,
although,
it
would
be
open
to
this
court
to
reconsider
it
if
it
so
wanted.
my
argument
was
based
on
whether
the
construction
court
on
the
statute
by
the
new
hampshire
courts
went
so
far
as
to
deny
to
appellant
his
rights
under
the
united
states
constitution,
the
first
amendment,
the
fourth
amendment
as
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
so
when
he
was
summoned
or
let
me
interject
this.
this
case
depends
very
much
on
the
facts,
the
law
has
been
cited,
the
cases
have
been
cited
which
are
very
familiar
to
you,
sweezy,
uphaus,
watkins,
wilkinson,
braden,
barenblatt.
they're
all
cited
in
the
briefs
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
more
profitable
to
determine
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
what
is
the
applicable
law?
now,
i
might
also
advert
to
the
fact
that
i
have
cited
cases
and
among
the
cases
which
i
already
spoke
off,
some
of
those
also
say
it
but
on
page
13
of
my
brief,
i've
quoted
two
recent
united
states
supreme
court
cases.
where
there
is
a
significant
encroachment
upon
personal
liberty,
the
state
may
prevail
only
upon
showing
a
subordinating
interest
which
is
compelling,
bates
versus
little
rock.
and
again,
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
consistently
held
that
only
a
compelling
state
interest
in
the
regulation
of
the
subject
in
justified
limiting
first
amendment
freedoms.
so,
i
turn
to
the
start
of
this
proceeding
before
the
attorney
general
and
--
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
yes.
on
the
--
on
the
majority
decisions
of
this
court,
that
is
true.
they
balance
the
rights
of
the
individual
against
the
rights
of
the
state
under
the
circumstances
to
see
whether
the
state
as
such
urgent
reason
for
action
as
to
warrant
infringement
of
what
otherwise
would
be
the
individual's
rights
under
the
constitution.
you
will
find
that
--
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
well,
there
is
the
view
--
there
is
the
view
mr.
justice
that
the
first
amendment
is
exactly
what
it
says
and
cannot
be
limited
but
that
is
not
then
the
majority
view
of
this
court.
the
majority
view
of
this
court
as
said
that
the
rights
of
the
individual
under
the
first
amendment
or
the
fourth
amendment
maybe
infringed
only
when
the
state
shows
an
urgent
necessity
or
compelling
reason
for
doing
so.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
well,
maybe
limited.
did
i
say
infringed?
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
i
think
i
get
what
your
honor
is
driving
at.
the
right
of
the
individual
is
limited
under
certain
emergency
circumstances
so
that
the
use
of
the
word
'infringed'
is
wrong,
i
should
have
used
the
word
'limited'.
now,
the
record
of
the
hearing
before
the
attorney
general
under
this
summons
is
found
on
page
26
of
the
record
and
it
goes
on
for
some
pages.
and
the
appellant
through
his
attorney
inquired
immediately
as
to
what
the
foundation
of
the
attorney
general
was
for
this
new
proceeding,
what
he
was
investigating.
and
the
attorney
general
said
that
first
of
all,
he
didn't
admit
that
he
had
to
show
any
basis
for
investigation.
he
have
to
show
a
form
of
probable
cause
and
then
he
--
on
page
28,
he
referred
to
--
in
very
general
terms,
the
communist
party
as
it
existed
in
the
late
1940s
nationally
and
internationally.
and
then
he
said,
there
is
extensive
documentary
--
documented
sworn
testimony
to
the
effect
that
hugo
degregory
has
been
for
a
long
active
within
the
communist
party
of
the
state
and
on
the
later
page,
he
said
that
--
no,
i'll
leave
it
with
that.
and
with
that,
the
attorney
for
the
appellant
said,
when,
where,
what
is
this
sworn
testimony?
what
year
does
it
applied
to?
where
was
it?
and
the
attorney
general
went
no
further.
and
so
the
appellant
made
the
following
sworn
statement
in
this
proceeding
and
i
may
interject.
he
later
repeated
that
under
oath
in
the
court
when
the
proceeding
got
to
the
court.
“i
would
like
to
state
mr.
gall
that
i
am
not
now
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
have
not
been
at
any
time
since
the
authority
you
have
cited
for
revised
statutes
annotated
chapter
588,
section
8
(a)
that
i
have
no
knowledge
of
any
communist
activities
in
new
hampshire
during
this
period
or
of
any
violations
rsa
588
during
this
period
of
six
and
one-half
years.
in
fact,
i
am
not
even
aware
of
the
existence
of
a
communist
party
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
at
any
time
the
authority
you
have
cited,
section
8
(a)
has
been
on
the
statute.
and
in
view
of
the
foregoing,
i
do
not
understand
what
it
is
i
have
to
face
here
today.”
and
the
only
reply
of
the
assistant
attorney
general
was,
“well,
we
have
some
questions
to
ask
you.”
and
so,
proceeding
from
there,
he
asked
questions
such
as,
“have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
have
you
ever
been
an
officer
of
communist
party?”
and
each
time
the
appellant
would
say,
“when?
what
period
are
you
talking
about?”
and
the
attorney
general
would
say,
“any
period.”
and
so
the
appellant
under
those
circumstances
and
in
view
of
the
sworn
statement
that
he
gave
declined
to
answer
those
questions.
and
then
we
came
to
the
next
stage
before
the
superior
court.
the
attorney
general
filed
a
petition
in
the
superior
court
under
the
appropriate
new
hampshire
statute
to
have
the
appellant
ordered
to
answer
the
questions
or
held
in
contempt.
the
appellant
filed
an
answer
which
among
other
things
set
up
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
proceeding
as
so
applied.
in
the
court,
there
was
a
long
discussion
as
to
foundation.
the
attorney
general
again
said
that
he
didn't
really
feel
that
he
needed
to
establish
it.
and
then
he
went
on
to
mention
again
the
sworn
testimony
in
the
file
and
he
was
challenged
repeatedly
on
that.
“produce
it.
what
year
does
it
refer
to?
where
is
it?”
and
the
court
never
ordered
him
to
produce
it
or
spends
part
of
the
year
and
he
never
did.
and
in
fact,
the
court's
decision
later
was
not
based
on
this
statement
of
unknown
sworn
statements
in
the
file.
it
was
based
solely
on
a
report
which
i
will
get
to
shortly.
it
developed
that
the
attorney
general
really
was
relying
on
the
1955
report
of
the
attorney
general
of
new
hampshire
to
the
legislature.
that
report
was
attached
as
an
exhibit
in
the
uphaus
case
in
360
u.s.
here
and
is
on
file,
a
number
of
copies
in
this
court.
in
view
of
that,
the
parties
in
this
case
have
stipulated
that
we
would
not
file
the
whole
document.
it's
about
250
pages
and
it's
getting
very
scarce
and
i
say,
there
are
so
many
cases
on
file
in
the
courts
among
other
things.
and
so,
i
named
pages
204
to
206
of
that
document
as
part
of
the
record
because
they
had
been
referred
to
in
the
court
hearing
and
because
they
deal
specifically
with
the
appellant.
the
appellee,
attorney
general,
asked
me
to
stipulate
that
he
would
have
the
right
to
refer
to
other
parts
of
the
document
and
argument
and
i
so
stipulated.
and
in
appendices
to
his
brief,
he
has
referred
to
other
parts
of
the
document
which
he
does
not
give
a
page
number
on
so
i
don't
know
where
they
are.
i
don't
even
have
a
copy
of
that
document
at
this
point.
but
i
do
have
some
notes
as
to
certain
references
he
made.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
you
have
the
full
report
in
the
files
of
the
uphaus
case.
wyman
versus
--
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
exactly,
your
honor.
you
field
a
dissenting
opinion
in
the
uphaus
case
in
which
you
went
in
at
length
to
this
very
same
document.
you
analyzed
it
at
length.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
it
was
that
below
any
bigger.
so
the
court
determined
that
on
the
basis
of
that
1955
report
that
adequate
foundation
had
been
laid
that
under
the
statute
that
provided
the
reasonable
and
reliable
information
as
to
violations
of
the
statute.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
that
report
was
dated
january
4,
1955
and
its
content
referred
chiefly
to
earlier
years
going
back
to
the
1930s
and
in
no
case
running
beyond
1954.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
the
date
of
the
inquiry
of
this
inquiry
in
the
court
was
may
of
1964.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
over
nine
years,
over
nine
years
after
the
information
in
the
report.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
i
have
cited
your
honor
the
american
committee
for
the
protection
of
the
foreign
born
and
the
veterans
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade
cases
in
my
brief.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
i
am
your
honor.
that
is
one
of
my
arguments.
i
argue
lack
of
foundation.
i
argue
that
the
construction
of
the
new
hampshire
court
goes
so
far
that
it
would
permit
almost
any
state
investigation
in
this
field,
whatever
foundation
was
laid.
the
foundation
here
is
so
flimsy.
i
want
to
go
into
the
appellee's
brief
in
which
he
makes
certain
allegations
of
fact
which
are
not
supported
on
the
record.
he
says
and
he
repeats
it.
and
he
repeats
it
time
after
time.
he
describes
appellant
degregory
as
secretary-treasurer
and
organizer
and
leader
in
new
hampshire
of
the
communist
party.
well,
i
refer
this
court
to
the
record
that
portion
of
the
1955
report
which
i
already
said
which
is
found
on
page
--
pages
23
through
26
of
the
record.
and
there
it
shows,
“yes,
hugo
degregory
was
in
the
communist
party
in
1946
in
massachusetts
and
there's
no
later
showing
as
to
that.”
yes,
he
was
a
paid
functionary
with
communist
party
according
to
this
report
in
massachusetts
and
not
new
hampshire
in
1947
and
1948
no
later
record
shown.
now,
as
to
his
being
a
leader
in
new
hampshire
of
the
communist
party,
that
is
not
shown
at
all
and
in
a
couple
of
places.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
in
massachusetts.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
and
he
was
alleged
who
have
been
a
paid
functionary
in
applying
'47
and
'48
in
massachusetts
not
in
new
hampshire.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
it
was
contained
in
the
attorney
general's
report,
yes.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
presumably,
yes.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
no.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
that
i
don't
know
your
honor.
the
report,
as
i
recall
it,
states
that
130
persons
were
summoned
and
examined
by
attorney
general
wyman
before
this
report
came
out
and
who
gave
such
evidence
as
to
appellant
degregory
i
couldn't
say.
now,
this
--
the
--
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
yes,
but
when?
he
has
said
to
have
been
functionary
of
the
party
in
47
or
48
in
massachusetts.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
well,
in
answer
to
your
question,
it
does
come
out
on
page
19
of
the
transcript
of
the
record,
statement
of
mr.
gall
near
the
top
of
the
page
in
which
inquiry
was
made
by
me
as
to
what
period
he
was
inquiring
about
and
he
replied
or
has
stated
to
the
court,
your
honor,
based
on
the
information
that
is
in
the
report
covering
that
period
of
years
which
is
any
period
during
the
period
that
is
reflected
in
the
report.
in
other
words,
he
was
inquiring
as
to
1954
and
previously.
he
was
not
inquiring
as
to
communist
activities
or
subversive
activities
current
in
new
hampshire
at
the
time
he
brought
those
summons.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
yes,
and
--
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
that
is
correct
and
degregory
have
already
testified
as
to
the
previous
six
and
a
half
years
and
questioned
the
constitutional
authority
of
the
attorney
general
to
go
into
the
period
before
unless
he
had
some
current
activities
which
would
permit
him
as
ancillary
to
those
current
activities
to
go
into
activities
that
long
ago
passed.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
it
is
the
general
new
hampshire's
statute
of
limitations
which
is
six
years.
now,
the
statement
in
the
appellee's
brief
that
degregory
was
the
leader
of
the
party
in
new
hampshire
is
based
on
the
following
and
on
page
9
of
the
report,
quote,
he
cites
page
9
of
the
report
for
this
and
this
is
the
only
thing
on
page
9
that
i
can
find
which
would
justify,
“a
long
time
communist
party
official,
hugo
degregory,
currently
a
functionary
in
new
hampshire
may
currently
be
the
power
behind
the
party
in
this
state”.
that
makes
him
a
new
hampshire
leader
of
the
party
according
to
the
appellee
in
its
brief.
then
the
appellee
also
makes
another
statement
in
his
brief
which
i
must
challenge.
as
one
of
the
bases,
as
one
of
the
foundations
that
he
says
he
has
for
going
forward
with
this
investigation.
he
says,
first
of
all,
he
has
the
report.
second,
we
have
still
the
same
airfields,
military
installations
in
new
hampshire
which
would
be
vulnerable
to
communist
activity
and
then
he
says,
page
27
in
his
brief,
“there
are
also
presently
residents
of
new
hampshire
who
are
many
of
the
individuals
discussed
in
said
report”
and
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
to
back
that
up.
you
search
the
record,
there
is
nothing
there
to
back
up
that
statement.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
there
are
also
presently
residents
of
new
hampshire
who
are
many
of
the
individuals
discussed
in
said
report.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
the
record
reference
is
obviously
to
the
big
red
report
of
1955.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
there
are
individuals
discussed
in
that
report
except
for
appellant.
appellant
was
discussed
in
the
1955
report
when
he
is
still
a
resident
of
new
hampshire.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
but
i
--
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
i
point
out
your
honor
that
that
was
not
the
appellant's
position.
he
made
this
one
statement
as
to
the
period
since
june
of
1957
disclaiming
membership,
knowledge
or
any
part
in
communist
party
or
subversive
activities
and
if
the
attorney
general
had
believed
that
he
was
not
telling
the
truth,
it
was
open
to
him
to
cross-examine
on
that
and
he
never
did
so.
that
testimony
of
degregory
stands
uncontradicted
by
any
cross-examination
or
any
independent
evidence.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
yes,
they
are.
well,
i
think
you
can
best
find
them
in
the
brief
of
the
appellee.
i'm
having
a
little
trouble
finding
them
in
the
brief
of
the
appellee.
here
we
are
at
page
31.
"have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party?”
"when
did
you
join
the
communist
party?”
"were
you
a
paid
member
of
the
communist
party?"
“were
you
an
officer?”
"did
you
have
access
to
--
well
and
so
on?”
and
before
the
attorney
general,
each
time
the
appellant
asked
“when?
what
period
are
you
speaking
of?”
and
he
never
got
any
specification
to
any
period
as
the
reply.
and
in
that
--
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
well
--
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
alright,
but
it
has
been
made
clear
by
the
attorney
general's
own
statement
that
he
was
investigating
the
period
of
19
--
early
1950s
and
back
rather
from
the
present.
now,
i
may
say
the
appellee
has
cited
and
cited
a
certain
quotation
from
the
case
of
communist
party
versus
the
subversive
activities
control
board
in
which
he
says,
“where
the
current
character
of
an
organization
of
the
nature
of
its
connection
with
others
is
an
issue,
of
course,
past
conduct
is
pertinent”
and
goes
on
like
that,
and
this
of
course
i
admit.
of
course,
past
conduct
is
pertinent
to
explain
present
statements
or
present
conduct
but
here
we
don't
have
any
present
statements
or
present
conduct.
the
attorney
general
is
not
investigating
it
at
present.
he
has
summoned
the
appellant
--
the
appellant
has
testified
as
to
the
present.
the
attorney
general
has
produced
nothing
else
as
to
the
present
which
would
permit
him
to
investigate
under
this
statute
as
to
subversive
activities.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
it
is
my
belief
mr.
justice
that
this
one
statement
covers
every
one
of
those
questions.
this
one
statement
would
cover
as
is
to
every
one
of
those
questions.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
well,
i
read
it
--
i
read
the
statement
earlier
to
your
honor.
it's
contained
twice
in
the
transcript
of
the
record
once
before
the
attorney
general
and
once
before
the
court.
you
will
find
it
on
--
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
page
30
of
my
brief.
and
--
oh,
excuse
me,
page
30
of
the
record
and
--
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
yes,
as
you
say,
page
3
of
my
brief.
and
if
--
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
no,
no
such
claim
at
all.
no.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
there
was
a
discussion
as
to
that
in
the
previous
case
but
no
discussion
as
to
that
in
this
case.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
i
rely
on
the
right
of
privacy
under
the
first
amendment,
the
right
against
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment
--
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
well,
it
has
been
so
mentioned
your
honor
in
the
case
for
instance
of
--
you
have
a
difficulty
in
considering
an
investigation
of
subversive
activities
as
involving
the
fourth
amendment?
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
alright
--
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
and
an
investigation
without
--
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
investigation
without
proper
foundation?
well,
that
is
one
of
my
arguments,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
relying
on
mapp
versus
ohio
which
of
course
wasn't
actually
--
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
well,
i
know
and
i
cannot
say
them
to
you
right
at
the
moment
certain
statements
in
the
legislative
investigating
cases
which
do
bear
on
the
fourth
amendment
and
i
regret
that
i
do
not
have
those
so
tabbed
in
my
brief
that
i
can
bring
a
citation
right
out
now
to
your
honor
on
that.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
absolutely.
yes.
in
watkins
--
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
in
watkins
versus
the
united
states,
354
u.s.,
cited
on
my
brief
at
page
8.
it
was
said,
the
first
amendment
may
be
invoked
against
infringement
of
the
protected
freedoms
by
law
or
by
lawmaking
and
that
was
the
case
of
a
legislative
investigation.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
the
claim
was
here
without
a
foundation
to
go
forward
or
without
a
legal
foundation
that
the
attorney
general
could
not
properly
proceed
and
if
i
may
put
it
in
three
short
statements.
the
attorney
general
can
constitutionally
investigate
current
subversive
activities,
if
he
has
evidence
of
them.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record.
he
can
inquire
at
a
past
conduct
to
throw
or
lay
down
the
present,
if
he
has
some
evidence
of
the
present.
there
is
no
such
evidence
in
this
record.
he
can
inquire
that
the
trick
posted
by
the
communist
party
in
new
hampshire,
if
he
has
some
evidence
that
there
is
a
communist
party
in
new
hampshire.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
has
been
a
communist
party
in
new
hampshire
since
1953.
i
cited
in
my
brief
the
case
of
pennsylvania
versus
nelson
to
show
the
limited
power
of
the
state.
the
state
is
not
defending
the
whole
united
states
now
reference
as
to
as
adam
spies
of
the
berlin
wall
are
not
apposite
here.
this
is
the
safety
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
the
attorney
general
is
confined
to
his
defense
of
that
and
should
produce
for
the
record
what
he
has
to
justify
his
investigation
as
to
that.
therefore,
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
this
investigation
has
gone
beyond
the
grounds
of
the
constitution
and
the
order
of
the
new
hampshire
court
should
be
reversed.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
no,
your
honor.
i
think
i've
exhausted
my
time.
mr.
howard
s.
whiteside
i
--
i
have
no
further
comment.
