mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
only
issue
before
the
court
that
i
see
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
application
of
new
hampshire,
rsa
588
(a)
as
applied
in
the
facts
of
the
instant
case.
the
constitutionality
was
not
raised
below
and
i
believe
it
was
decided
by
this
court
in
wyman
v.
degregory,
368
u.s.
19.
the
basic
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
that
is
the
only
issue
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
no.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
this
is
in
the
past.
we
have
to
--
we
felt
we
have
to
lay
a
foundation
in
the
past
to
build
up
to
the
future.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
we
felt
at
that
time,
your
honor,
that
he
did
have
information.
we
would
--
we
wish
to
follow
it
up
from
the
past
to
the
present
to
tie
the
whole
picture
in.
as
a
basis
of
cross-examination,
you
have
to
--
we
felt
we
have
to
lay
the
foundation
to
where
he
was
in
the
past
to
get
at
the
present.
it
would
be
cross-examining
in
a
vacuum.
all
we
have
at
the
present
was
the
basic
fact
that
--
the
basic
statement
made
by
this
individual.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes,
we
could
have.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
no,
we
didn't.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
we
have
the
broad
brushstroke
of
the
past
but
one
of
the
violations
of
our
law
that
is
only
set
up
in
there
is
destroying
any
records
which
belong
to
the
communist
party.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
no,
that
was
not
asked
at
that
time.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
we
were
more
or
less
precluded
by
the
court
at
that
time.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
well,
then
it's
the
immunity
provision
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
no,
that
question
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
he
was
asked
if
he
wish
to
take
the
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
--
immunity
provision
and
he
declined
to
with
reference
to
each
question.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes,
he
did.
and
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes,
we
went
back
to
the
superior
court.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
we
attempted
to
ask
him
more
questions.
the
justice
at
that
time
indicated
that
his
jurisdiction
had
seized
under
the
statute.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
justice
of
the
superior
court,
justice
marshall.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
well,
if
i
might
explain
it.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
we
went
to
the
superior
court
at
that
time.
mr.
degregory
purged
himself
of
contempt.
the
proceeding
then
--
we
asked
the
court
to
allow
us
to
continue
at
that
time
before
this
court.
he
indicated
to
us
that
he
had
no
further
jurisdiction
of
the
matter
that
we
have
to
go
back
administratively
and
ask
the
question.
then
if
he
brought
to
answering
any
further
questions
then
we
proceeded
as
we
did.we
came
up
through
this
period
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes,
we
did.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
within
two
days.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
we're
here
today.
we
went
in
the
superior
--
from
the
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
went
from
there
to
the
superior
court
and
at
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
and
we're
here
on
that
very
issue
today.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
i
use
it,
i
think,
because
my
brother
mentioned
--
used
the
term
cross-examination.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
not
technically
so.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
i
think
i
did.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
i
would
call
it.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
well,
we
asked
a
certain
amount
of
--
a
few
questions
of
the
witness.
he
then
made
a
statement
on
the
record
under
oath
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
communist
party
for
the
last
six
and
a
half
years.
it
wouldn't
be
a
technical
cross-examination.
no,
it
would
be
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
no,
he
hadn't
your
honor.
that's
the
proper
term.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes,
they
are
31
and
32.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
his
statement
was
made
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
now,
i
might
add
that
exhibit
1
which
is
subversive
activities
in
new
hampshire
report
of
the
attorney
general
in
1955
that
all
of
these
materials
were
gathered
by
former
attorney
general
wyman
and
the
material
in
there
was
under
oath
when
presented
to
him.
now,
getting
back
to
the
concept
of
nexus
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes.
they
are
a
great
deal
to
our
conclusions
that
somehow
the
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
with
reference
to
the
concept
of
nexus,
there
are
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
the
concept
of
nexus,
the
relationship
of
the
witness
to
the
subject
under
investigation.
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
roughly
seven
cases
starting
with
the
gibson
case
and
the
rest
of
the
florida.
and
here,
we
had
an
investigation
of
communist
infiltration
into
organizations
in
the
race
relations
area.
the
witness
at
that
time
was
the
president
of
the
naacp
in
florida
and
what
the
state
was
after
at
that
time
were
membership
list
primarily
plus
other
information.
now,
in
this
case,
you
have
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
nexus,
basically,
because
the
president
was
not
a
communist
--
there
was
no
communist
tie
up
at
all,
either
the
president
or
any
of
the
members
of
the
party.
this
is
the
far
end
of
the
gamut
in
nexus.
sweezy
case
would
be
the
next
one
in
line
which
the
court
did
not
overturn
the
case
on
the
basis
of
no
insufficient
nexus.
i
believe
the
primary
thrust
in
this
instance
was
the
court
was
not
aware
of
whether
or
not
the
new
hampshire
legislature
wished
to
be
informed
on
this
matter.
and
--
but
the
area
or
the
compelling
interest
in
this
case
of
infil
--
communist
infiltration
into
the
area
of
education
in
new
hampshire
was
deemed,
i
believe,
in
that
instance
to
be
a
compelling
interest.
now,
the
remaining
cases
starting
with
the
watkins
case
where
it
was
a
federal
investigation
at
that
time
into
the
area
of
infil
--
communist
infiltration
and
subversion,
in
this
case,
two
prior
witnesses
pinpointed
watkins
as
a
communist.
he
is
a
communist
recruiter
from
1942
to
'47,
roughly
eight,
nine,
ten
years
before
the
case
finally
came
before
the
court.
and
this
was
considered
a
sufficient
relationship
to
proceed
to
examine
the
individual
and
this
case
too
was
reversed
but
not
for
the
reason
of
an
insufficient
nexus.
it
was
because
the
witness
was
unable
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
question
asked
to
him,
the
pertinency
aspect
which
i
will
get
in
to
a
little
bit
later
in
my
argument.
now,
the
wilkinson
case
and
the
braden
case
also
a
federal
case
as
in
the
federal
were
investigations
of
communism
into
the
area
of
communism,
this
time
by
the
federal
government
and
again,
this
was
considered
a
compelling
interest
to
proceed
with
the
investigation.
in
both
of
these
cases,
the
witnesses
were
not
tied
up
as
of
the
present
time.
there
was
a
relation
back
of
their
position
in
the
communist
party.
and
again,
we
have
the
uphaus
case
which
is
a
new
hampshire
case,
a
state
investigation
into
subversion
in
affecting
security
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
mr.
uphaus
was
the
executive
director
of
the
world
fellowship
which
was
a
group
where
19
to
20
known
communists
were
meeting
and
discussing
on
what
we
believe
more
than
an
academic
level
area
of
communism.
we
--
it
was
sufficient
to
trigger
our
investigation
of
this
area,
the
court
held
and
it
was
a
compelling
interest.
now,
the
key
case,
i
think
which
is
almost
in
point
with
us
is
the
barenblatt
case.
in
here,
mr.
barenblatt
was
an
active
member
of
the
communist
party
from
'47
to
'50
while
a
student
and
a
teaching
fellow
at
the
university
of
michigan.
now,
this
was
another
federal
investigation
into
the
area
of
subversion
into
education.
there
was
no
major
tie
up
from
this
individual,
barenblatt
from
'47
to
'50
in
that
area
to
the
present,
the
same
position
as
degregory.
the
record
was
quite
espoused
in
that
area.
now,
the
court
upheld
the
position
that
there
was
a
valid
nexus
between
the
parties
in
this
case
and
this
is
--
this
is
pretty
much
what
we
have
in
the
degregory
case
and
of
course
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes,
it
is.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
if
i
might
explain,
i'm
not
--
not
completely.
no,
your
honor.
what
our
position
is
as
our
supreme
court
held
that
taken
the
nature
of
the
communist
party
and
its
motive
and
aims
coupling
this
with
the
report
of
the
attorney
general
that
the
--
that
our
attorney
general,
the
present
attorney
general
at
that
time,
had
reasonable
and
reliable
information
to
trigger
his
investigation
into
subversion
in
and
effecting
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
no,
it's
not
our
position
that
he
have
to
show
with
reference
with
particular
individual
that
he
has
specifically
committed
a
crime
or
he
is
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes,
we
do.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
he
could,
providing
there
with
sufficient
nexus
or
relationship
of
the
individual
to
the
subject
under
investigation.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
that
he
does.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
i'm
not
sure
i
fully
understand
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
this
is
why
i
cited
the
subversive
activities
in
court.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes,
there
is
and
i
would
think
this
might
be
--
very
well
be
the
limit
because
of
a
nexus
factor
that
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
i
don't
think
there's
any
specific
period.
i
believe
that
this
nexus
concept
is
a
case-by-case
study
of
the
position.
now,
if
all
you
have
was
one
sworn
statement
that
an
individual
was
a
communist
in
1931
and
you
had
nothing
else,
i
think
the
state's
position
would
be
extremely
weak.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
well,
i
think
that
relates
very
closely
to
the
problem
at
hand.
the
world
conditions
have
not
change
very
much.
i
think
it
was
in
the
mind
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
mind
of
our
court
when
they
took
this
into
consideration
that
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
well,
it's
accelerated,
i
think.
it
hasn't
abated.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
i
would
think
--
assume
that
the
legislature
would
want
to
know
the
extent
of
communist
activities
in
and
affecting
the
states
so
that
they
can
either
possibly
maybe
repeal
this
law
or
add
new
laws,
change
or
amend
it.
it's
our
contention
that
the
legislature
just
can't
operate
in
a
vacuum.
they
have
to
have
a
basis
in
fact
to
proceed.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
i
have
to
answer
by
yes
or
no
on
this.
i
have
to
go
back.
i
think
for
where
starting
point,
with
the
position
of
our
supreme
court
that
it's
--
its
basic
fundamental,
i
believe,
the
nature
of
the
communist
movement,
its
ideals,
its
aims,
its
aims,
its
threat
and
i
can't
--
and
if
you
take
this
and
you
couple
it
with
the
record
here.
now,
i'll
move
myself
back
to
the
prior
degregory
case
which
we
had
and
the
case
law
has
always
been
the
same.
the
position
on
the
communist
party
had
been
the
same
and
it
hasn't
change
up
to
date.
the
world
situation
with
communism
was
known
to
the
courts
at
that
time
and
it
is
--
i
feel
accelerated
somewhat.
the
problem
is
still
there.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
in
1960?
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
well,
we
have
vietnam
problem.
we
have
a
berlin
wall.
communism
is
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
10
years
ago,
no.
i'm
relating
to
this
to
the
(voice
overlap)
with
korea
10
years
ago.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
i
think
it
is.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
directly,
i
would
say
very
little,
indirect.
collectively
to
the
people
it's
very
little.
directly
to
cer
--
to
various
individuals
it
might
be
great.
i'm
use
--
citing
the
vietnam
problem
--
these
problems
that
--
this
is
what
must
have
been
in
the
minds
of
our
attorney
general.
the
courts
i
feel,
our
new
hampshire
courts
can't
blind
themselves
to
world's
condition.
they
can't
operate
in
a
vacuum
the
same
as
the
legislature
there.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
well,
self-preservation
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
as
far
as
the
records
go,
there
is
no
evidence
as
of
that.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
but
that
bear
in
mind
is
the
problem.
we
do,
i
might
add,
make
a
report
to
the
legislature
every
year,
every
other
year
explaining
what
our
findings
are.
we
have
not
made
a
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
pardon?
i
did
not
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
quite
frankly,
i
didn't
make
the
report.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
i
didn't
make
the
report.
if
you
allow
me
a
moment,
i
would
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
well,
we've
--
in
light
of
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
the
uphaus
case
we
have
not
made
a
formal
report.
the
report
is
made
basically
to
committee
and
the
committee
takes
it
from
there.
with
the
information
available
in
our
files
that
we
would
present
a
formal
report
if
required.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
the
legislature
has
felt
that
the
law
which
we
have
is
operating
well
and
that
they
intend
to
keep
it
as
such.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes,
they
did
because
that's
when
they
made
it
a
continuing
operation
after
'55
and
'57.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
no.
there
was
a
bill
before
the
house
last
year
but
it
was
defeated
with
reference
to
communist
speaker
to
state
institution.
similar
law
which
i
think
south
carolina
has.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
i
wouldn't
think
so
because
the
nature
of
the
law
that
i
think
got
blown
out
of
proportion
by
political
problems
involved,
side
issues
and
personalities
as
opposed
to
the
actual
need
of
the
law.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
the
prophecy
would
be,
i
feel
legislatively.
i
feel
the
state
is
doing
a
proper
job
in
this
area
and
they
are
being
properly
informed
on
the
present
state
of
the
record
and
the
present
state
of
the
facts
which
we
have
that
there's
no
necessity
to
change
the
law.
now,
if
i
might
add
with
reference
to
--
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
possibly
half
a
dozen
witnesses
or
so
at
that
time.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
i
believe
the
question
was
directed
to
--
at
the
time
of
the
second
hearing,
1963.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
yes.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
no,
you
will
not
find
that.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
it
would
be
in
our
file.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
no,
there's
no
written
report,
no.
the
procedure
has
been
for
the
attorney
general
to
go
before
the
committee
and
orally
present
the
basic
facts
at
that
time
as
requested
it
would
be.
again,
we
do
have
a
problem
with
gathering
this
information
by
the
reluctance
of
the
witnesses
to
testify
and
also,
our
files
--
well
we
have
no
access
to
the
files
that
any
of
the
federal
agencies
with
the
information
which
they
have
in
this
area
that
all
on
our
own
basis,
we
have
to
go
out
and
gather
this
information.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
i
believe
so.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
well,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
it
from
the
position
as
i
cited
in
my
brief.
the
threat
is
not
like
the
horse
of
the
mongols
coming
out
of
the
woods
and
overthrowing
our
state.
the
problem
is
the
nature
of
the
communist
party,
the
infiltration
of
the
probing.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
peter
shapiro
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
think
so.
no,
your
honor.
