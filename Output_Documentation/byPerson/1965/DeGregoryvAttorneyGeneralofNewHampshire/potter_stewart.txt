justice
potter
stewart
the
--
those
quotations
you
read
by
the
duty
of
this
court
to
balance,
is
that
right?
balance
the
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
individual
has
rights
under
the
constitution
he
hasn't,
doesn't
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
and
then,
in
other
words,
there
were
some
--
it's
been
said
that
degregory
was
a
functionary
of
the
communist
party.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
at
all
clear
and
i
suppose
that
was
the
basis
for
these
questions,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
where
the
questions
were
directed
at,
to
finding
out
when
at
all,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
question
was
or
the
following
questions
was,
“were
you
ever
or
have
you
ever?”
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
pretty
clear
if
you
--
it's
just
an
ordinary
meaning
of
english
words
that
doesn't
say
1954
or
previously,
that
says
ever.
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
people
who
are
going
to
be
permitted
to
absolutely
refuse
to
answer
any
questions?i
suppose
you're
not
going
to
have
very
much
in
any
record
about
anything,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
except
if
i
refuse
to
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
what
were
--
are
the
questions
of
--
which
are
the
subject
of
this
contempt
commitment
here
in
the
record
somewhere?
justice
potter
stewart
a
question
like
when
did
you
join
the
communist
party
like
that
you
have
answer
is
either
to
give
a
date
or
else
i
never
did
join
them.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
a
matter
of
when
because
only
the
witness
knows
when.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
where
is
that
statement
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
page
3
of
your
brief,
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
page
3
of
your
brief,
is
it,
the
statement
of
the
case?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
no
claims
for
immunity?
i
think
isn't
there
some
immunity
--
justice
potter
stewart
just
what
--
just
what
constitutional
rights
are
you
relying
on
here?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
--
i
have
a
little
difficulty
of
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
might
or
might
not.
it
might
if
there
were
search
or
seizure
of
a
man's
personal
effects
--
justice
potter
stewart
--or
a
house
without
a
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don't
think
that's
here,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
relying
on
what,
griswold
against
connecticut
something
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
like
breaking
into
somebody's
house
without
a
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
first
amendment,
there
is
guarantees
of
free
speech
and
free
exercise
of
religion,
redress
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
right
to
petition
government.
justice
potter
stewart
how
can
--
this
certainly,
it's
very
possible
that
in
the
course
of
a
legislative
investigation
there
might
be
an
infringement
of
the
right
of
a
free
press
or
the
free
exercise
of
religion
but
i
just
wonder
what
the
claim
was
here.
justice
potter
stewart
this
complicate
the
constitutionality
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case
was
certainly
raisable.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
issues
which
have
been
argued
by
your
brother
are
not
before
us,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
alright.
not
with
that
respect.
now,
the
basic
legal
test
to
be
employed
by
the
court
is,
has
the
interest
of
the
state
in
this
instance
to
adequately
inform
itself
in
order
to
protect
its
legitimate
and
vital
interest,
then
pressed
into
fatal
collision
with
the
constitutionally
protected
rights
of
defendant.
this
was
brought
out
in
the
uphaus
v.
wyman
case
and
it
was
i
believe
restated
in
gibson
versus
florida
legislative
committee,
372
u.s.
it's
actually
a
balancing
test
between
the
rights
and
responsibilities
of
the
government
on
one
hand
and
the
constitutional
rights
of
an
individual
on
the
other
hand.
now,
our
courts,
new
hampshire
supreme
court
is
very
familiar
as
i
cited
on
page
10
of
my
brief
with
this
type
of
proceeding.
they've
been
informed
in
the
sweezy
case
and
the
uphaus
case
by
this
court
the
proper
application
to
be
applied
in
this
instance
and
they
have
been
affirmed
in
the
second
uphaus
case
and
later
degregory
case
as
to
the
application
of
the
statute.
it's
our
contention
that
once
the
appellate
court
concludes
that
the
lower
court
has
applied
the
appropriate
law,
the
proper
law
of
the
case,
it's
not
the
duty
of
the
appellate
court
to
substitute
their
judgment
but
that
of
the
lower
court
but
whether
or
not
there
is
adequate
evidence
in
the
record
to
sustain
the
position
of
the
lower
court.
basically,
three
problems
that
i
find
involved
this
case,
one,
that
has
been
raised
would
be
the
staleness
issue
which
relates
to
the
nexus
between
the
subject
under
investigation
and
the
individual
witness
mr.
degregory.
the
compelling
interest
of
a
state
would
be
the
second
interest
involved.
now,
the
one
point
which
distinguishes
the
present
case
of
degregory
versus
the
attorney
general
from
the
prior
case
is
a
lapse
of
time
of
roughly
three
years.
everything
else
is
basically
the
same.
now,
once
the
court
has
determined
that
there
is
a
valid
fact-finding
hearing
and
investigation
has
been
started
properly,
it's
the
duty
of
the
state
to
tie
the
witness
into
this
investigation
to
show
a
proper
nexus.
now,
the
subject
under
investigation
here
is
generally
communism
in
and
affecting
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
the
basis
being
that
the
interest
here
is
self-preservation
--
which
has
been
--
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
which
has
been
long
stated
by
this
court
as
a
valid
interest
of
investigation
by
the
state.
the
subject
of
investigation
is
the
communist
party
which
has
been
held
by
this
court
in
the
barenblatt
case
specifically
as
a
--
the
communist
party
is
different
than
any
other
political
party.
its
basic
nature,
its
aim,
the
ultimate
overthrow
of
our
form
of
government,
our
democratic
form
of
government,
has
been
held
to
be
a
valid
area
of
investigation.
and
the
vehicle
for
the
investigation
has
been
held
valid
as
i've
cited
in
the
cases
in
my
brief
is
the
legislative
fact-finding
committee.
in
this
case,
the
attorney
general
is
appointed
as
such.
and
--
now
with
reference
to
the
nexus
involved,
the
following
is
a
brief
resume
of
the
witnesses'
relationship
to
the
subject
under
inquiry.
in
appendix
k
of
my
brief,
cited
at
page
78,
it
indicates
that
degregory
was
a
candidate
in
massachusetts
for
lieutenant
governor
in
1940.
the
daily
worker
named
him
as
a
member
of
the
communist
political
association
in
'42.
in
'45,
he
was
on
the
letterhead
of
the
communist
party
in
massachusetts
as
secretary-treasurer.
now,
this
is
in
massachusetts.
he
was
active
in
the
communist
party
in
massachusetts
in
1949.
he
was
a
paid
functionary
in
1949.
now,
in
appendix
h
of
my
brief
at
page
65,
it
describes
the
relationship
of
massachusetts
--
following
new
england
states
is
for
the
exception
of
connecticut
were
considered
district
1
of
the
communist
party
and
they
all
were
tied
up
together.
now,
in
1950,
degregory
moved
to
new
hampshire
where
he
presently
resides
also
it
indicates,
i'm
now
back
to
appendix
k,
that
he
was
active
in
new
hampshire
from
'46
to
'48
which
would
tie
up
the
relationship
between
massachusetts
and
new
hampshire.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
had
all
these
information,
why
do
you
need
to
ask
him
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
has
told
you
--
he
told
you
in
the
statement
appearing
on
page
3
of
your
adversary's
brief
of
the
situation
as
to
the
present
and
the
immediate
past
and
you
have
the
information
about
the
more
remote
past,
so
why
do
you
need
to
ask
him
any
question?
justice
potter
stewart
you
could
--
he
made
the
statement
as
to
his
present
status
vis-à-vis
the
communist
party
that
is
the
absence
of
any
relationship
and
also,
the
same
situation
for
the
last
six
and
a
half
years
and
that
you
could
have
cross-examined
him
about
that
i
suppose,
couldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
didn't,
did
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
are
now
telling
us
you
have
the
other
information
about
the
more
remote
past
and
that
the
question
appears
to
me
is
to
why
it
was
necessary
to
interrogate
him,
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
ask
him
if
he
had
done
that?
justice
potter
stewart
so?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
if
that's
a
crime,
i
suppose
he
could
refuse
to
answer
that
on
the
basis
of
self-incrimination.
justice
potter
stewart
that
question
wasn't
asked
to
him.
justice
potter
stewart
immunity.
justice
potter
stewart
i
used
that
word.
i
don't
know
if
you
did.
you're
point
is
i
did?
justice
potter
stewart
the
questions
i
gather
on
page
31
of
your
brief,
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
appeared
to
be
--
what
might
be
called
direct
examination.
justice
potter
stewart
because
he
hadn't
testified,
had
he,
under
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
called
him
--
you
called
him
and
he
was
your
witness
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
an
investigation
and
you
asked
him
questions.
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
questions
appear
on
31
of
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
refused
to
answer
him
or
else
you
covered
him
by
asking
you
questions.
justice
potter
stewart
when,
where
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
hear
all
the
plans?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
more
of
a
change,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
new
hampshire's
interest,
i
mean,
what's
the
state
of
new
hampshire's
interest
in
the
vietnam
problem?
justice
potter
stewart
as
if
the
--
people
are
not
going
to
be
--
are
going
to
be
permitted
not
to
refuse
to
answer
all
the
questions
of
the
subject.
you're
not
going
to
have
any
information.
