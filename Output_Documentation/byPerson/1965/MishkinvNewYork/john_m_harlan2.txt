justice
john
m.
harlan
under
the
second
question,
mr.
redfield,
am
i
right
to
conclude
the
question
was
heard
in
the
trial
court
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
and,
you
say
--
you
say
that
the
(inaudible)
were
masochistic
and
so
forth
on
its
content
--
the
content?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
obscene?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court
of
appeals
has
never
got
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court
of
appeals
did
deny
reviewing
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
affirmed
without
opinion.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
what
you
really
meant
suppose
by
your
standard
line
is
that
there's
no
knowledge
in
his
part
that
he
violated
the
law
--
that
at
this
point,
he
didn't
know
he
did?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
still
don't
see
how
that
question
is
presented
because
the
lower
court
said
that
(inaudible)
proceeding,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
it.
then
why
is
that
(inaudible)
which
we
have
to
take
in
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
affirmed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
courts
ought
to
write
an
opinion,
wouldn't
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
do
you
deal
with
the
phase
of
the
search
and
seizure
clause,
which
involved
this
kind
of
--
these
evidentiary
facts
for
the
purpose
(inaudible)
and
then
the
seizure
--
that
seizure
to
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
weren't
there
some
institution
or
at
least
the
records
have
cited
--
cited
that
the
(inaudible)
where
there
are
certain
incidents
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
books
were
they,
what
exhibits?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
bet
the
argument
is
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
what?
justice
john
