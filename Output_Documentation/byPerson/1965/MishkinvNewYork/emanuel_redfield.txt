mr.
emanuel
redfield
mr.
chief
justice,
the
honorable
court.
this
case,
your
honors,
brings
up
broader
questions
of
constitutional
law
than
was
involved
in
the
case
you
just
heard
and
i
assume
in
the
case
following
me.
this
case
brings
up
three
novel
constitutional
questions
which
are
just
begging
for
resolution,
and
it
also
brings
up
other
questions
of
constitutional
importance
which
are
not
novel
but
which
certainly
go
toward
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
man's
right
of
publication
should
be
met
with
a
sentence
of
three
years
in
jail
and
a
fine
of
$12,000.
the
three
novel
constitutional
questions
as
i
see
them
are
--
may
books
that
are
devoted
to
descriptions
and
narrations
of
sadism
and
masochism,
may
they
be
proscribed?
the
second
question
is,
are
these
phrases
sadistic
and
masochistic
as
used
in
the
statute
vague?
and,
the
third
is
a
question
that
was
lift
over
by
smith
against
california,
and
that
is
a
question
of
scienter,
the
question
what
knowledge
does
the
purveyor
have
to
know
in
order
that
he
may
be
punished
for
violating
the
statute?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
what
it
says.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir,
that's
what
he
said
and
he
relied
upon
another
opinion
of
a
co-coordinate
judge,
and
i
do
not
feel
that
that
has
resolved
a
problem
because
i
do
not
think
we
have
an
authoritative
construction
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
whom
which
this
appeal
has
come.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no
sir.
and
we
are
in
the
worst
position
than
we
were
here
in
the
winters
case
because
at
least
in
the
winters
case
we
had
a
construction
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
no,
sir.
it
did
review
but
it
affirmed
--
it
affirmed
without
opinion.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
and
it
affirmed
both
in
my
case
and
it
affirmed
the
appeal
taken
by
the
people
and
--
which
you're
not
concerned
with
here.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
so,
i
won't
go
into
it.
the
other
questions
that
are
before
your
honors,
other
than
these
novel
questions,
is
this
--
“are
these
books
obscene?”
and
“is
the
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york
as
construed
by
the
courts,
vague
and
uncertain?”
and
thirdly,
is
a
question
left
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
mapp
decision
came
after
these
cases
were
decided
and
we
have
a
serious
question
of
search
and
seizure
here.
now,
i
believe
and
i
hope
that
the
court
could
resolve
all
these
problems
and
i
know
it's
quite
a
job
and,
after
being
before
this
court
for
more
than
30
years,
i've
never
yet
been
able
to
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
the
ground
that
the
court
selects
for
its
decision
on
whenever
there
are
competing
constitutional
questions,
but
i
must
say
that
from
what
i've
observed
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
courts
of
other
jurisdictions
in
which
i
was
counsel
and
otherwise,
that
there
is
a
great
need
that
these
questions
be
resolved
now.
now,
as
i
said
before,
this
man
got
a
three-year
jail
sentence
and
a
$12,000
fine
for
putting
out
these
books.
i
will
not
say
that
these
books
are
great
bits
of
learning
nor
even
interesting
to
me
or
to
others,
but
there
are
probably
some
who
like
to
read
it
and
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i'm
sorry,
perhaps
it's
the
mic.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
some
--
some
people
would
like
to
read
these
books.
i'll
come
to
that
part.
i
don't
want
to
get
off
my
argument.
now,
this
man
was
charged
and
it
was
information
involving
198
counts
and
the
counts
divide
themselves
into
three
categories.
well,
there
were
four,
first.
the
first
category
was
that
he
possessed
these
books
for
distribution
or
sale.
secondly,
that
he
published
these
books.
thirdly,
he
got
--
employed
others
to
do
it.
these
are
the
three
categories.
and
the
fourth
category
was
that
he
published
them
without
putting
his
name
in
violation
of
the
general
business
law
of
new
york.
the
latter
part
was
declared
unconstitutional
by
our
new
york
courts,
and
so
it
remains.
so
that
for
each
category,
he
received
a
jail
sentence
of
one
year
to
run
concurrently
--
i'm
sorry,
consecutively,
so
that
all-in-all
he
has
three
years.
and
i
should
point
out
here
too
that
the
jail
sentences
were
on
counts
1,
48,
and
65
because
i
think
it
may
be
of
value
to
your
honors
to
know
that.
the
--
but
i
should
also
emphasize
this,
that
there
are
no
facts
in
the
record
which
showed
that
he
knew
that
these
books
were
the
character
that
the
statute
proscribes.
in
other
words,
my
emphasis
is
placed
on
this
aspect
of
the
smith
against
california
decision.
we'll
say
that
he
knew
that
these
books
were
erotic
one
or
that
they
were
filthy
or
whatever
you
call
it,
but
there
was
no
showing
that
he
knew
that
these
books
were
obscene.
now
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
this
is
the
case
but
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
right,
but
even
if
--
because
i
lay
this
stress
on
it,
he
might
have
told
the
writers
what
to
write,
but
he
might
have
done
so
innocently
thinking
he
has
a
right
to
write
these
things.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
i
wouldn't
say
that's
scienter.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
it
would
say
--
it
would
only
mean
that
he
knew
what
the
words
were
but
he
didn't
know
what
their
value
was.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well,
they
would
have
to
--
they
seem
to
be
doing
it
in
new
york.
they
seem
to
be
supplying
it,
but
they
didn't
have
--
didn't
do
it
in
this
case.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
they
have
admissions,
confessions,
and
statements
made
to
the
--
to
people
who
bought
it.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
the
only
one
i
could
suggest.
i
don't
know
how
otherwise
they
could
do
it.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
right,
exactly.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
would
say
so,
yes.
otherwise,
how
could
you
get
to
the
mens
rea
about
what
you
--
the
court
spoke
in
the
california
case?
now,
i
move
on
to
the
question
of
“may
sadistic
and
masochistic
books
be
proscribed?”
in
1956,
the
new
york
statute
was
amended
to
add
with
the
words
--
to
the
obscenity
statute
the
words
“sadistic”
and
“masochistic”.
up
to
that
time,
we
had
a
string
of
words
in
the
statute
that
--
relating
to
obscenity,
but
there
wasn't
satisfaction
with
that
statute
by
the
prosecuting
authorities
because
they
--
according
to
the
legislative
documents
that
i
have
briefed
to
your
honors,
they
felt
that
the
obscenity
statute
was
not
adequate
to
cover
sadistic
and
masochistic
literature.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
from
this
legislative
history
alone,
one
must
conclude
that
these
two
words
are
completely
independent
from
the
word
“obscenity”
as
had
heretofore
been
used
in
the
statute.
so
the
question
therefore
is,
“may
sadistic
books
be
prohibited?”
mr.
emanuel
redfield
because
the
court
of
appeals
may
not
have
ruled
on
that
aspect
of
the
statute.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
it
affirmed.
it
may
--
it
has
affirmed
on
grounds
other
than
just
the
construction
of
the
statute.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
you
could
have
a
construction
of
a
statute
by
silence.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
true
enough
but,
if
you
want
a
construction
of
a
statute,
i'm
pretty
sure
you
have
to
write
about
it.
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
that
only
obscene
books
may
be
proscribed,
and
if
sadistic
and
masochistic
books
are
of
a
different
nature,
then
the
statute
violates
the
doctrines
of
this
court
in
construing
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
agree
that
new
york
is
hard-put
to
this
statute
and
now
argues
and
demand
that
mr.
justice
harlan
has
stated,
and
that
is
that
they
are
synonyms
for
obscenity.
if
they
are
synonyms,
i
can't
see
what
the
need
for
them
had
been.
were
they
just
trying
to
add
additional
words
to
the
statute?
they
came
into
the
statute
specifically,
as
the
legislative
finding
show,
because
of
the
need
to
get
at
these
books.
so
therefore,
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
so
far
as
this
statute
seeks
to
prohibit
sadistic
books
or
masochistic
books,
the
statute
is
invalid.
i
turn
to
the
question
now,
“what
does
the
word
“sadistic
and
masochistic”
mean?
according
to
general
use,
they
mean
the
infliction
of
punishment
and
the
enjoyment
by
the
inflictor
and
masochism
is
the
converse.
that
to
me
is
the
same
problem
you
had
in
the
winters
case
where
you
had
to
rule
on
the
statute
which
proscribed
literature
made
up
of
stories
of
bloodshed,
lust,
and
--
bloodshed,
lust,
and
crimes.
and
the
court
said
literature
could
be
made
up
of
those
things
because
if
the
statute
sought
broadly
to
proscribe
such
literature,
there's
no
end
to
the
amount
of
literature
that
may
be
prohibited.
now,
in
connection
with
what
was
said
by
the
lower
court
here,
if
the
construction
of
the
lower
court
were
accepted
as
for
the
first
time
construing
this
statute
so
as
to
bring
this
defendant
within
the
net
of
the
statute,
then
clearly,
my
client
is
made
the
guinea
pig
to
supply
legislative
deficiency.
that
was
what
was
before
the
court
in
the
lanzetta
case
and
that
is
what
this
court
said,
that
you
cannot,
for
the
first
time,
construe
a
statute
in
such
a
way
as
to
bring
a
man
within
its
scope.
the
legislature
has
to
be
clear
in
the
first
place.
and
also,
in
the
winters
case,
i
recall
the
court
ordered
a
re-argument
and
asked
counsel
to
brief
that
very
question
because
it
was
claimed
too
in
that
case
that
a
construction
was
being
made
for
the
very
first
time.
the
court
didn't
have
to
pass
upon
it
because
it
assumed
that
the
statute
was
clear
for
the
sake
of
argument.
but
if
the
lower
court
had
for
the
first
time,
made
a
construction
so
as
to
render
this
man's
conduct
guilty,
then
i
say
such
a
construction
is
an
invalid,
one
that's
a
denial
of
due
process.
it
should
also
be
said
that
in
the
trial
court's
decision
nor
in
any
other
court
was
any
finding
made
as
to
which
particular
books
fell
into
a
category
of
obscenity
and
which
particular
books
fell
into
the
category
of
being
sadistic
or
masochistic.
there
was
a
general
broad
pronouncement
by
the
trial
court
that
these
books
were
obscene.
in
view
of
that,
since
there
was
no
separation
made
by
the
court
or
any
finding
made
as
to
any
particular
books,
there
has
to
be
a
reversal
in
the
event
you
find
some
of
these
books
obscene,
but
seen
in
some
books
sadistic,
because
you
cannot
tell
which
books
the
courts
found
to
be
in
which
category,
and
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
did
in
the
stromberg
case.
now
--
i
turn
now
to
the
question
whether
or
not
these
books
--
particular
books
are
obscene.
these
are
the
books
i
would
say
are
of
the
type
of
books
that
were
referred
to
in
the
klaw
case
that
justice
brennan
spoke
about
before.
these
are
books
that
seem
to
have
been
directed
to
a
certain
class
of
people
who
might
get
a
certain
amount
of
pleasure
from
them.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
there
are
--
nobody
categorized,
and
that's
what
i
said
before.
there
were
no
findings,
there
were
no
categories,
they
were
all
lumped
together.
all
--
what
i
gather
from
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court,
the
court
said
these
books
are
sickening.
well,
perhaps
they
are
sickening
to
most
of
us
who
liked
to
read
better
things.
but,
whether
or
not
they're
--
they
fall
or
following
of
the
statute
is
another
thing.
and
there
was
no
proof
anywhere
by
the
prosecution
that
these
books
have
a
tendency
--
not
a
tendency
--
due
to
the
average
person
create
a
prurient
condition.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
these
books,
i
don't
think
appeal
to
the
average
person.
these
might
appeal
to
elderly
persons.
it
might
appeal
to
impotent
persons.
it
might
appeal
to
perverse
persons
who
might
get
certain
amount
of
pleasure
out
of
them.
whether
it's
a
prurient
pleasure,
i
don't
know,
but
it
is
a
pleasure
evidently,
judging
by
the
sale
that
these
books
enjoyed
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
--
and
the
prices
that
are
put
on
the
books.
i
would
say
that
in
cases
of
this
nature,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
state
to
prove
that
these
books
have
the
qualities
they
attribute
to
them
and
there's
no
such
proof
in
the
record.
the
--
a
lot
has
been
said
about
whether
or
not
the
books
have
a
redeeming
social
value.
i
cannot
strongly
urge
that
point
because
i,
myself,
do
not
believe
that
books
cannot
be
said
to
have
a
redeeming
social
value.
i
think
all
books
have
a
redeeming
social
value.
it
all
depends
to
whom
and
for
what
purpose.
it
may
be
even
for
the
sake
of
proving
that
the
opposite
is
virtuous.
and,
to
prove
that
any
book
has
a
redeeming
social
value
puts
the
court
in
the
position
of
being
a
literary
critic,
and
whether
or
not
a
court
wishes
to
be
a
literal
--
a
literary
critic
is
another
story.
the
fact
is,
however,
the
court
has
to
review
these
cases
and
unfortunately,
has
to
read
all
these
books.
and,
it
is
very
similar
to
this
situation
i
had
here
12-15
years
ago
and
this
boy
in
syracuse,
finer,
i
believe
his
name
was,
who
made
a
speech
on
the
corner
and
the
question
put
before
the
court
was
whether
this
boy
should
be
jailed
for
30
days
because
he
made
a
speech
which
some
people
thought
was
inflammatory.
there
was
a
division
of
the
court
but
the
court
did
have
to
review
the
speech
and
see
whether
or
not
such
a
speech
was
inflammatory,
and
you
can't
get
away
from
it
if
you
are
to
review
a
person's
right
to
speak
without
restraint.
and
the
same
would
apply,
i
urge,
to
such
doctrines
as
to
whether
or
not
a
book
has
to
be
patently
offensive.
i
say
to
you,
why
must
one
be
judged
by
what
offends
others
and
who
is
to
be
the
judge
of
what
is
patently
offensive
to
a
community,
whether
it's
the
community
of
a
tiny
village
or
a
city
or
the
entire
nation.
thank
you.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
have
a
few
more
minutes.
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
fact
that
this
question
is
not
minimal
because
exhibits
1
through
42
consisting
of
about
17,000
books,
was
seized
pursuant
to
a
warrant
and
they
were
admitted
in
evidence
only
on
condition
that
the
warrant
and
the
officer
seizing
the
books
would
be
produced,
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
issue
was
waived
in
anyway
by
the
fact
that
the
owner
of
the
warehouse
consented
that
they'd
be
taken
out.
you
had
a
case
here
--
the
only
part
of
this
here
where
a
man's
wife
permitted
the
officers
to
take
the
