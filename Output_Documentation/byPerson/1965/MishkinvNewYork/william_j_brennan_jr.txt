justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
i
couldn't
quite
hear
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see
if
(inaudible),
is
this
the
case
where
defendants
were
--
the
theme
was
outlined
by
this
defendant,
the
writer,
in
length
of
this
book?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
content
of
it
--
what
was
--
he
wanted
the
author
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
say?
this
is
that
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
your
argument
that
nonetheless,
while
he
did
all
of
those
things,
the
government
as
i
gather
said,
he
actually
write
it
himself.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
yet
he's
not
--
it
cannot
be
said
that
he
knew
that
the
contents
were
obscene
even
if
in
fact
they
were,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that's
not
true
at
all
(inaudible)
the
different
categories?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
what's
the
point?
did
they
had
an
appeal
only
to
a
special
audience
and
not
to
the
average
person?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
you
--
did
i
understand
you
say
--
acceptance
as
opposed
to
rejection,
distaste
as
opposed
to
acceptance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
middle
ground
--
toleration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
your
solution
for
those
who
can't
accept
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
your
solution
for
those
who
can't
accept
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
mr.
uviller,
this
--
this
high
heels
and
other
stuff
--
what
i
would
think
would
have
to
be
rather
sophisticated
in
the
appeal
of
that
that
have
any
sense
of
revulsion
to
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
speaking
now
of,
i
don't
know
what's
your
first
or
second
leg
either
but
--
the
one
that
you
suggest,
we
may
rely
upon
the
average
person
in
the
community
and
my
question
is
really
how
the
average
person
in
the
community
can
find
this
stuff
offensive
at
all.
really,
some
of
it
looks
no
different
than
used
to
be
an
old
sears,
roebuck
catalogues
of
corsets
50
years
ago.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
no,
i'm
not
thinking
what
is
so
bad.
your
argument
is
that
it's
going
to
be
offensive
to
the
average
man.
that's
a
different
question
from
its
appeal,
and
i
follow
that,
and
i
sympathize
with
that
argument
but
i
do
have
trouble
understanding
how
--
unless
one
is
sophisticated
in
its
appeal,
how
one
can
be
offended
by
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
beatings
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
thinking
of
henry
and
mississippi,
but
we
didn't
--
