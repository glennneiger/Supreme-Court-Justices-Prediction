mr.
h.
richard
uviller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
propose
to
divide
my
argument
in
a
rather
conventional
manner,
discussing
first
the
substantive
issues,
meaning
of
the
term
“obscenity”
and
particularly
as
applied
to
materials
of
this
character
and
coming
second,
to
the
procedural
points
which
are
raised
by
the
trial
--
the
prosecution,
trial,
and
conviction
of
edward
mishkin
exactly
five
years
ago
in
new
york.
i
hope
that
i
may
launch
the
first
stage
of
my
argument
from
the
premise
that
there
is
something
in
this
world
of
wonders
which
is
called
“obscenity”
and
that,
whatever
it
may
be
it
does
escape
through
the
narrow
crack
in
the
door
from
the
protected
enclave
of
the
first
amendment.
perhaps,
at
that
point,
i
should
heed
the
advice
of
mr.
justice
stewart
and
others
and
may
it
merely
submit
the
exhibits
to
the
court
with
the
statement
that
i
believe
that
the
court,
upon
examination
of
the
exhibits
themselves,
will
find
that
they
are
in
fact
obscene.
but,
i
confess
that
i
cannot
force
myself
to
sit
down
so
soon
when
there
are
so
many
challenging
concepts
before
the
court
today.
the
distinction
between
the
obscene
and
the
permissible
has
been
described
as
a
dim
and
uncertain
mind.
many
who
have
labored
at
the
task
have
confessed
themselves
unable
to
formulate
a
precise
general
definition
of
the
obscene
which
was
susceptible
of
ready
application,
particularly
in
the
difficult
areas
which
are
called
“borderline.”
it
is
the
hope,
i'm
sure,
of
this
court
in
hearing
these
appeals
and
of
all
other
courts
which
have
considered
this
question
that
somehow
through
the
series
of
decisions,
not
merely
the
words
used
in
the
opinion,
the
precise
scope
of
the
test
of
obscenity
will
become
increasingly
clear
and
more
readily
susceptible
of
application.
i,
for
one,
think
that
where
tests
are
concerned,
the
formulation
--
the
famous
formulation
of
the
roth
case
is
an
excellent
one.
i
do
believe
that
being
expressed
in
but
a
single
sentence
in
that
decision
and
that
sentence
combining
several
different
concepts
that
it
might
be
helpful
if
that
test
--
if
the
basic
skeleton
of
that
test
are
could
be
filled
in
by
some
further
explication.
it
is
our
interpretation
and
our
submission
to
this
court
that
the
roth
test
is,
in
effect,
a
tripod
standing
on
three
legs,
all
three
of
which
are
necessary
to
support
any
conviction
or
restriction
upon
the
dissemination
of
printed
matter.
those
three
legs,
i
think,
embrace
quite
different
considerations
and
the
total
effect
of
the
three
together,
properly
interpreted
would
assure
us
that
there
would
be
no
criminal
prosecution
or
restriction
on
the
pre-dissemination
of
material
which
should
enjoy
the
protections
of
the
first
amendment.
in
my
way
of
thinking,
the
first
of
these
are
these
three
indispensable
legs
is
the
patent
offensiveness
test.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
patent
offensiveness,
or
patent
offensiveness
--
the
quality
of
material
which
transgresses
against
the
acceptable
norms
of
candor
what
judge
learned
hand
had
described
as
that
contemporary
critical
point
between
candor
and
shame.
this
is
a
standard
which
i
think
characterizes
the
reaction
of
the
communities
to
allegedly
obscene
or
pornographic
matter.
as
far
as
the
ordinary
members
of
the
community
are
concerned
or
those
so-called
average
or
the
normal
individuals
who
make
up
a
community,
regardless
of
its
geographical
limits,
they're
reaction
is
one
of
either
a
shock
or
tolerance
of
revulsion
and
distaste
or
of
acceptance.
and,
i
think
that
the
community
as
a
standard
for
the
measurement
of
offensiveness
is
a
realistic
and
a
workable
measure.
i
would
suggest
that,
as
to
that
test,
a
court,
while
certainly
reviewing
it
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
so
i
think
i
mentioned
tolerance
too.
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
offensiveness
has
to
be
a
kind
of
a
positive-negative,
if
you
will.
it
has
to
be
stimulated
an
affirmative
feeling
of
rejection.
the
simple
--
it
doesn't
make
very
much
difference
to
me
whether
this
material
is
available
on
the
newsstands
or
not,
it
would
not
signify
a
reaction
of
--
consistent
with
patent
offensiveness.
the
offensiveness
must
be
a
gross
one.
the
affront
to
community
standards
must
be
a
significant
one,
an
appreciable
one,
and
i
think
it
should
be
judged
by
that
wonderful
legal
affliction,
the
average
member
of
the
community,
not
the
highly
sophisticated,
not
the
particularly
puritanical.
that
construct,
if
such
a
person
does
exist,
who
does
represent
an
amalgam
of
the
values
of
the
community.
as
to
that
test,
it
seems
to
me
that,
although
this
court
has
assumed
the
burden
of
review
of
offensiveness
in
the
first
instance
in
the
manual
enterprise
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
particularly
where
a
conviction
comes
from
a
state
court
and
particularly
where
the
fact
finder,
be
a
court
or
a
juror,
was
appreciative
of
the
appropriate
definition
of
the
standard
and
the
scope
of
the
measurement
that
a
sufficient
evidence
rule
would
be
appropriate
upon
review.
i
do
adopt
the
view
point
of
mr.
justice
harlan
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
state
application
of
standards
and
federal
application.
i
think
that,
as
he
persuasively
reasoned,
that
there
is
a
national
community
and
there
are
state
laboratories.
i
see
nothing
repugnant
to
differing
results
where
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
for
those
who
do
not
accept
the
distinction,
i
assume
that
we
must
simply
expand
our
imagination
and,
as
we
conceive
of
the
local
community
standards,
so
we
must
attempt
to
conceive
of
the
national
community
standards.
i
suggest
that
it
becomes
somewhat
more
complex
because
of
the
diverse
values
in
different
sections
of
the
country,
but
i
--
perhaps
it
is
not
all
that
difficult
since
there
are
very
diverse
values
even
in
so
small
community
as
the
city
from
which
i
held.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
question
in
this
case.
i
have
heard
no
argument
raised
that
this
material
is
offensive,
that
however
the
community
be
defined,
however,
the
average
man
within
that
community
be
imagined,
that
he
would
find
the
materials
in
this
case
that
mishkin
directed
and
published
and
sold
to
be
offensive,
to
be
somewhere
beyond
that
critical
point
and
into
the
area
of
shame.
the
second
test,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
test
of
redeeming
social
value
because,
clearly,
not
everything
which
the
common
man,
which
the
average
man,
rejects
as
offensive
is
--
can
be
prohibited
consistently
with
the
principles
of
the
first
amendment.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
test
of
social
value
or
redeeming
importance
is
one
which
should
more
appropriately
be
made
by
someone
who
is
more
sensitive
to
the
esoteric
values
that
usually
go
into
that
sort
of
judgment.
i
don't
suggest
that
the
court
is
of
a
scientific
authority
or
even
a
literary
critic,
but
the
court
does
have
the
assistance
of
literary
critics
and
experts
and,
moreover,
the
court
does
represent
a
body
which
has
certain
amount
of
familiarity
with
materials
which
might
be
deemed
offensive
by
the
ordinary
laymen.
consequently,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
test
of
redeeming
social
value,
an
extremely
important
one,
is
one
for
the
court.
i
don't
necessarily
suggest
that
this
court
must
assume
that
obligation
in
the
first
instance
every
time.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
appellate
structures
within
the
state
applying
standards
which
have
been
laid
down
by
this
court
are
entitled
to
a
certain
amount
of
respect
by
the
court.
and,
if
their
conclusion
is
reasonable
with
respect
to
social
importance,
it
may
not
be
necessary
for
this
court
to
assume
the
enormous
burden
of
reading
the
materials
one
by
one
in
the
first
instance.
listening
to
the
colloquy
or
in
earlier
arguments
this
afternoon,
i
might
say
that
i
would
never
have
suggested
in
the
first
instance
that
the
court
could
assume
a
burden
so
enormous,
not
to
mention
unending,
repetitive,
and
unpleasant.
in
fact,
in
assuming
the
burden,
the
court
recognized
the
unpleasantness
of
the
task
but
apparently
felt
impelled
to
do
so.
i
--
however,
once
it
has
been
assumed
by
the
court,
of
course
i
am
not
in
the
position
to
say
that
the
court
should
not
continue
to
exercise
it,
if
you
call
upon
to
do
so.
essentially,
what,
again
in
this
instance,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
such,
that
there
really
is
no
substantial
question,
there
is
no
argument,
there
is
no
contest,
there
is
no
claim
made
here
by
the
petitioners,
that
any
one
of
these
many
exhibits
in
evidence
has
the
slightest
value
--
social
value,
or
whether
that
term
be
conceived
of
as
a
scientific,
artistic,
literary,
or
any
other
value
of
any
sort.
consequently,
there's
no
real
dispute,
it
seems
to
me,
as
to
that
lack
of
a
test.
of
course,
what
the
dispute
on
obscenity
boils
down
to
is
the
third,
and
critical
and
perhaps
the
most
confusing
aspect
of
this
test,
and
that
is
the
appeal
to
prurient
interest.
the
original
formulation
of
roth,
of
course,
stated
whether
to
the
average
man,
applying
contemporary
standards,
the
dominant
appeal
of
the
work
taken
as
a
whole
appeals
to
prurient
interest.
now,
this
separation
of
the
average
man
and
prurient
interest
in
that
terminology
has
been
overlooked
by
a
number
of
jurisdictions
who
have
simply
read
the
tasks
as
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
of
the
average
man.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
grave
difficulties
if
the
measure,
the
litmus,
of
prurient
appeal
be
the
average
man.
for
one
thing,
we
are
told
by
such
experts
as
the
kronhausen's
and
lockhart
and
mcclure,
and
others,
that
the
essential
nature
of
the
most
easily
recognizable
form
of
obscenity
is
its
appeal
to
those
whose
sexual
development
has
been
in
some
way
either
arrested
or
distorted
that
while
these
materials,
perhaps
the
more
conventional
type
of
obscenity,
undoubtedly
have
a
certain
erotic
effect
on
almost
any
mature
person
and
maybe
some
immature
person,
or
even
knowing
that
there
is
a
stimulating
quality,
an
erotically
stimulating
quality.
that,
if
we
talk
of
appeal
in
terms
of
an
exaggerated
interest
in
the
materials,
that
such
appeal
would
be
found
only
in
those
who
suffer
from
that
sort
of
loneliness,
immaturity,
fright,
and
other
distortions
of
the
normal
sexual
appetites
and
i
don't
think
that
this
court
could
possibly
have
intended
to
postulate
an
average
man
to
whose
prurient
interest,
the
most
undisguised
pornography
appeals.
perhaps
one
of
the
difficulties
is
the
use
of
the
phrase
in
the
roth
case,
which
had
been
rejected
by
the
earlier
formulation
of
the
american
law
institute,
“arouses
lustful
thoughts.”
the
arousal
of
a
lustful
thought,
it
seems
to
me
is
quite
another
matter
than
the
appeal
to
prurient
interest.
if
the
word
“prurient”
be
taken
to
mean
an
exaggerated
lascivious
interest
and
the
appeal
be
considered
something
more
than
the
ordinary
appeal
that
many
perfectly
innocent
objects
might
have,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
one
is
not
dealing
with
the
average
man.
one
is
dealing
with
a
particular
susceptible
branch
of
the
community.
and
this
is
true
both
with
respect
to
the
so-called
conventional
pornography
and
the
bizarre
specialized
form
of
pornography,
that
is
--
makes
up
the
bulk
of
the
exhibits.
they're
not
all
the
exhibits
in
the
present
case.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
here,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
adopt
a
compromise,
a
modification,
of
the
variable
obscenity
test
which
was
favored
by
the
lockhart
and
mcclure.
i
do
think
that,
in
judging
--
in
selecting
the
group
by
which
the
prurient
appeal
should
be
measured,
one
must
take
into
consideration
the
circumstances
of
the
distribution
of
the
material,
the
apparent
target
the
group
was
intended
to
be
affected
by
it,
and
to
consider,
in
addition,
what
has
been
called
“those
into
whose
hands
the
material
is
likely
to
fall”.
now,
lest
there'd
be
any
--
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief,
lest
there'd
be
any
mistake
about
it,
this
does
not
signify
any
degree
of
return
to
the
discredit
in
the
hicklin
test
because
in
that
hicklin
test
of
course,
the
circumstance
were
not
--
the
test
was
not
based
upon
this
tripartite
consideration.
if
i
take
as
my
measure
of
prurient
appeal
in
this
material,
let
us
say
even
a
small
susceptible
group
who
find
a
morbid
and
sick
attraction
to
this
sort
of
material
and
prohibited,
i
am
doing
so
not
simply
on
the
basis
of
the
specialized
group,
but
i
am
doing
so
on
the
basis
of
the
revulsion
which
the
community
at
large
feels
against
it
in
deeming
it
offensive.
and
i
am
doing
it
after
the
material
has
been
adjudged
to
be
utterly
without
social
value
by
a
responsible
reviewing
group.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes.
well,
i
think
i
defined
a
meaning,
sir.
i
think
that
they
are
three
quite
separate
and
independent
tests.
i
think
that
the
audiences
by
which
they
are
measured
are
quite
independent.
i
think
that
the
ultimate
fact-finding
group
is
not
necessarily
the
same.
i
see
no
difficulty
at
all
in
applying
the
standards
of
the
community
at
large,
the
average
person,
the
normal
person
when
judging
the
revolting
quality
of
the
material,
whether
it
is
that
offensive.
on
the
other
hand,
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
to
refer
to
the
same
average
or
normal
man
when
i
try
to
assess
whether
the
material
has
any
of
this
morbid,
sick,
bizarre
appeal.
in
fact,
as
i
say,
i
think
it
would
be
quite
inconsistent
to
do
so
because
i
don't
--
i
think
that
one
would
be
faced
with
the
anomaly,
that
material
which
is
the
sickest,
the
most
obviously
subject
to
restriction
would
be
the
most
difficult
to
reach
because
the
normal
man
would
not
find
himself
erotically
attracted
to
it.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
they
may
be
neutral
insofar
as
the
erotic
impact
from
this
material
is
concerned.
i
dare
say
that
--
used
in
the
exhibits,
i
confess
to
a
great
sense
of
boredom
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
as
an
overwhelming
reaction.
however,
that
does
not
mean
to
say
that
they
may
not
be
offensive.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
i
do
think
they
are.
i
do
think
that
that
--
as
far
as
the
average
person
is
concerned,
he
is
not
repulsed
only
by
those
overly
candid
representations
of
so-called
normal
sexual
appetites
and
indulgences.
in
fact,
i
dare
say
that,
the
for
--
further
from
the
so-called
normal,
these
overly
candid
representations
get,
the
more
offensive
they
become.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
don't
think
that
the
sense
of
revulsion
is
related,
at
least
not
consciously
so
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
to
the
appeal.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
i
--
as
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
is
“what
is
so
bad
about
this
material?”
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
i
don't
know
whether
you've
had
the
opportunity
yet
to
examine
the
exhibits
themselves,
but
i
do
suggest
that
the
best
answer
to
that
question
is
from
an
examination
of
the
exhibits.
to
characterize
them
briefly,
it
is
not
simply
a
representation
of
high
heels
or
corsets.
it
is
an
unruly,
gross,
exaggerated,
bizarre,
repetitive,
cumulative
representation
of
nothing
but
this
form
of
sexual
stimulation,
this
bizarre
form
of
sexual
--
with
very
detailed
and
precise
reactions
of
the
participants
to
it
which
are
unquestionably
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
right,
which
are
unquestionably
erotic.
in
fact,
very
frequently
in
these
exhibits,
the
--
what
starts
out
as
simple
fetishes
and
a
description
of
the
great
pleasures
of
being
bound
in
leather
shortly
develops
into
a
tail
of
very
frank
lesbian
or
other
perverted
sexual
activities.
consequently,
i
do
think
that
although
the
specialized
appeal
on
this
may
be
lost
upon
the
average
individual,
i
do
think
that
he
is
in
the
position
to
react
with
respect
to
the
offensiveness.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
if
i
did,
it
was
--
i
misspoke.
i
do
not
mean
to
revert
to
the
average
man
as
a
test
of
prurient
interest.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
as
applied
to
this
case
or
any
case.
as
i
--
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
i
think
that
even
the
more
conventional
forms
of
pornography
are
not
necessarily
appeals
to
the
prurient
interest
of
normal
people
with
normally
developed
libidos.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
oh,
i
think
that
you
could
affirm.
i
think
that,
in
this
case,
the
record
is
amply
clear,
unfortunately
not,
that
the
defendant
not
only
knew
but
in
--
specifically
directed
the
production
of
this
material
for
purposes
of
appeal
to
a
very
special
group
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
--
who
do
react
to
it.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
now
that
is
--
that
is
of
course
with
respect
to
the
prurient
interest
test
alone
that
a
specific
group
to
which
a
material
is
directed
is
considered.
i
don't
think
this
particular
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
first,
with
respect
to
the
search
aspect
of
it,
obviously,
wares
that
are
openly
displayed
in
a
store
and
which
are
perused
by
a
police
officer
are
not
being
searched.
with
respect
to
the
seizure,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
same
considerations
govern
as
governed
in
any
other
criminal
prosecution,
and
that
is
to
say
that
the
police
officer
is
obliged
to
make
a
determination
as
best
he
can,
as
to
whether
it
is
probable
for
a
reasonable
person
to
believe
that
the
material
in
question
does
constitute
proscribed
material.
in
other
words,
the
standards
are
probable
cause
and
evidence
can
be
seized
upon
such
probable
cause
pursuant
to
an
arrest.
that
is
to
say,
the
arrest
itself
--
in
this
instance,
the
arrest
itself
was
based
on
probable
cause.
the
book
was
bought.
the
police
officer
having
the
book
in-hand,
the
defendant
having
sold
it
to
him,
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
defendant
had
sold
him
an
obscene
book
and
therefore
placed
him
under
arrest,
and
pursuant
to
that
arrest,
took
other
items
of
contraband
in
the
immediate
vicinity.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
such
incidents,
mr.
justice.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
i
may
be
--
i
may
not
have
the
one
in
mind.
there
were
so
many
seizures.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
and
of
course,
the
vast
majority
where
the
warehouse
is
where
the
books
--
the
seizures
are
--
the
seizures
were
over
a
period
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i'm
informed
that
your
honor
is
right,
that
of
the
158
books,
there
were
three
that
were
--
were
taken
without
any
indication
that
there
having
been
an
arrest.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
don't
believe
so.
those
are
exhibits
69
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
exhibits
69
through
71,
mr.
justice.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes.
well,
that
is
our
argument,
mr.
justice
harlan.
we
do
--
we
do
contend
that
they
are
contraband.
but
with
respect
to
seizure
at
that
stage,
all
that
is
requisite
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
their
possession
is
a
crime,
which
would
make
them
--
possession
with
intent
to
sell
is
a
crime.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
these
were
also
books
that
were
taken
from
a
bookstore
i
believe
sir
which
were
an
actual
--
an
actual
--
the
warrant
problem
is
--
the
warrant
problem
is
a
--
restricted
to
those
exhibits.
and
i
dare
say
the
means
of
procedure
in
the
case
as
a
whole,
the
importance
of
those
exhibits
is
minimal
even
if
there
was
a
--
the
record
itself,
for
example,
is
not
--
is
not
fully
explicit.
precisely
as
with
the
warrant
itself,
the
search
warrant
was
the
--
we
don't
even
know
the
bonafideness
of
the
search
warrant
in
as
much
as
there
was
no
point
raised
with
respect
to
the
search
warrant
doing
the
crime,
although
it
have
been
obtained.
thank
you.
