justice
abe
fortas
are
you
saying
--
are
you
saying,
sir,
that
if
the
third
standard
--
that
the
third
standard
is
met
if
the
--
in
the
literatarian
question
--
and
they
deemed
to
have
an
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
of
anybody,
single
person
or
how
would
you
define
that
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
if
you
say
--
as
you
started
to
say
that
there
are
three
legs
to
the
roth
test,
then
i
suppose
that
you'd
have
to
work
out
some
way
to
satisfy
we're
getting
--
i'm
getting
the
image
as
hopelessly
mixed
up,
satisfy
the
demands
of
each
leg.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
may
i
continue
this,
if
you
don't
mind?
it
seems
to
me
that
your
--
the
two
possibilities
with
respect
to
this
third
test,
the
appeal
to
prurient
interest,
one
to
which
you
seem
now
to
have
reverted
is
that,
in
the
particular
case
before
us,
there
may
be
an
appeal
for
prurient
interest
measured
by
the
average
man.
a
few
moments
ago,
you
were
suggesting
that
you
didn't
have
to
use
the
average
man
test.
justice
abe
fortas
as
applied
to
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
try
to
be
specific
about
this.
is
the
--
if
we
should
decide
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
state
of
new
york
to
establish
that
this
literatarian
in
the
michigan
case
presented
an
appeal
to
prurient
interest,
and
if
we
should
also
decide
that
you
cannot
satisfy
that
test
by
reference
to
the
average
man,
you
would
--
would
you
or
would
you
not
consider
that
we'd
have
to
reverse?
justice
abe
fortas
alright
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
you
say
is
that
--
is
it
this
prurient
summary
then
that
you're
suggesting
to
us
that
where
the
literatarian
question
is
directed
to
a
particular
group
that
we
should
consider
whether,
in
terms
of
that
particular
group,
there
is
or
is
not
an
appeal
to
prurient
interest?
justice
abe
fortas
you
make
it
--
making
it
in
a
little
difficultly,
or
when
you
define
that
group
or
the
group
that
has
perhaps
abnormal,
prurient
interest.
i
don't
think
that's
a
difficulty.
i
don't
think
it's
a
difficulty.
i
think
that
if
material
panders
and
caters
to
that
abnormality
as
it
is
related
to
libidinous
or
lascivious
desires
that
that
material
can
be
band,
censored,
if
it
satisfies
the
other
two
tests
as
well.
now,
obviously,
there
are
so
many
aberrations
that
there
are
many
perfectly
innocent
things
that
do
appeal
to
the
prurient
interest
of
the
selected
few,
but
there's
no
danger
that
those
things
could
be
proscribed.
most
of
them
are
not
at
all
offensive
with
respect
to
contemporary
standards
such
as
the
sears,
roebuck
catalogue
that
was
mentioned,
may
have
a
tremendous
appeal,
so.
i
do
think
also,
there
must
be
some
clarification
of
prurient
interest
in
terms
of
interest
rather
than
stimulation.
thinking
now,
the
moment
of
those
exhibits
in
this
collection
which
are
somewhat
more
conventional
in
their
sexuality,
these
so-called
hardcore
types
of
pornography
do
have,
undoubtedly,
a
certain
stimulating
effect.
nonetheless,
i
don't
think
that
on
that
account,
they
could
be
called
an
appeal
to
prurients
particularly
as
that
is
defined
as
a
morbid
or
sick
and
unusual
attraction.
with
respect
to
the
procedural
issues
which
are
involved
in
this
case,
the
suggestion
has
been
made
that
there
must
be
some
sort
of
a
prior
adversary
proceeding
in
as
much
as
these
lines
are
deemed
uncertain
so
that
a
perspective
defendant
would
have
a
way
of
knowing
whether
the
particular
material
in
question
was
obscene.
the
suggestion
is
made
relying
on
marcus
and
quantity
of
books
against
kansas
that
a
search
warrant
cannot
issue
without
such
a
determination.
now,
i
suggest
that
this
is
a
wholly
impractical
and
unnecessary
consideration.
first,
in
this
case,
there
is
no
search
and
seizure
problem.
the
vast
majority
of
the
books
of
15,000
were
taken
from
a
warehouse.
they
were
taken
from
the
warehouse
not
only
by
a
search
warrant,
which
had
been
obtained
some
years
before
mapp
against
ohio,
by
a
search
warrant.
but
more
importantly,
they
were
clearly
taken
by
a
consent.
the
defendant's
accomplice,
mr.
levenberg,
conferred
with
his
lawyer,
and
the
lawyer
and
the
accomplice
decided
to
give
these
books
which
were
in
the
exclusive
control
and
custody
of
mr.
levenberg
up
to
the
police.
and,
that
is
the
way
in
which
the
--
there
couldn't
be
a
clearer
example
of
consent.
so,
there
is
no
search
and
seizure
problem
as
to
those.
as
to
the
others,
some
were
bought
in
bookstores
by
the
police.
there
couldn't
be
a
search
and
seizure
question
there.
but,
in
any
event,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
prior
adversary
proceeding,
although
it
would
be
helpful
in
a
sense
there
could
be
some
determination
of
obscenity
before
prosecution,
would
only
be
a
workable
device
where
the
defendant
himself
is
willing
to
submit
the
exhibits
in
question
for
such
a
determination.
it
would
be
a
wholly
impractical
device
in
any
instance
in
which
--
in
other
words,
the
closer
you
get
to
the
core
of
the
hardcore,
the
more
impractical
this
procedure
becomes.
if
you
serve
a
perspective
defendant
with
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
to
produce
a
certain
stag
movie
for
a
--
proceeding
under
22
(a)
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
in
new
york,
you
would
be
very
lucky
if
the
defendant
himself
showed
up,
let
alone
bring
the
stag
movie
with
him.
consequently,
the
only
way
in
which
there
can
be
a
determination
of
obscenity
with
respect
to
the
really
bad
material
is
by
obtaining
the
evidence
first
in
ex
--
as
the
effect
of
an
ex
parte
order.
