we'll

chief
justice
earl
warren
united
states,
petitioner,
versus
charles
e.
o'malley
et
al.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
don't
know
whether
it's
important
to
--
in
the
(inaudible)
--
to
the
decision
of
this
case
but
did
he
reserve
the
right
also
to
distribute
the
corpus
that
he
so
chose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
to
the
beneficiary
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
when
he
put
it,
distributed
it
at
anytime
during
his
lifetime
or
was
it
just
the
income
that
he
could
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
the
income
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
fieldman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fieldman,
before
you
get
to
that.
would
you
mind
restating
your
position
with
regard
to
the
difference
between
the
corpus
and
the
income
that
it
seems
rather
strange
to
me
that
where
he
had
disposed
irrevocably
the
corpus
that
it
would
be
considered
a
part
of
his
estate
when
he
died.
but
that
the
income
from
that
over
which
he
had
some
jurisdiction
should
be
--
should
not
be
considered
a
portion
of
his
estate,
i
--
i
didn't
quite
get
your
argument
on
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
the
thing
that
--
the
thing
that
bothers
me
is
that
even
conceding
your
premise
in
the
case
of
the
corpus,
he
has
only
a
very
limited
right
over
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
over
the
property.
but
so
far
as
the
income
is
concerned
he
has
absolute
right
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
so
far
as
distribution
of
it
is
concerned.
and
why
in
the
one
case
where
he
has
a
limited
right,
he
should
be
--
the
estate
should
be
taxed
but
in
the
other
it
cannot
be.
i
--
that's
my
problem.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
alright,
you
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i've
just
been
looking
at
the
opening
--
at
the
first
paragraph
of
the
trust
and
doesn't
that
purport
to
sell,
assign,
transfer,
and
set
over
under
the
trustees
that
following
describes
securities
and
plus
the
income
thereon?
it
--
on
page
24,
that
the
settlor
in
consideration
of
the
agreements
and
undertakings
here
and
after
made
by
the
trustees,
thus
hereby
sell,
assign,
transfer,
and
set
over
under
the
trustees
and
then
75
shares
of
capital
stock
go
--
paid
by
insurance
company
and
the
trustees
are
hereby
authorized
to
and
agree
that
they
will
receive
the
--
all
of
the
said
securities,
cash,
real
estate,
or
other
property
as
may
be
transferred
and
so
forth
and
the
income
there
from
for
the
uses
and
purposes
upon
the
terms
and
conditions
here
and
after
provided.
isn't
that
the
--
isn't
that
purport
to
the
advance
for
--
of
the
income
as
well
as
the
corpus
sets
out.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
right
to
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
beneficiaries
do
have
the
right
to
receive
it,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
except
that
control
is
when
and
how
is
left
with
the
settlor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
--
yes,
yes,
of
course.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
