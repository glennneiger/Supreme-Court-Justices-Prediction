mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
estate
tax
case
involving
five
irrevocable
inter
vivos
trusts
created
for
the
benefit
of
the
settlor's
wife
and
daughters.
because
the
provisions
of
all
the
trust
are
substantially
the
same,
i
would
refer
them
collectively
as
if
they
were
both
a
single
trust
and
a
single
beneficiary.
the
original
trust
corpus
consisted
are
shares
in
a
closely
controlled
corporation,
controlled
by
the
settlor
mr.
fabrice,
the
company
was
known
as
the
paper
(ph)
board
company.
the
trust
was
to
last
for
25
years
and
will
terminate
at
the
end
of
the
25
years
after
its
inception.
the
corpus
was
then
to
be
distributed
to
the
beneficiary,
or
if
she
were
not
living,
to
her
descendants.
during
the
life
of
the
trusts,
mr.
fabrice
and
his
two
co-trustees
were
doubted
discretionary
power
to
pay
all
or
any
part
of
the
annual
trusts
income
to
the
beneficiary,
to
the
extent
that
any
portion
of
income
was
not
distributed,
and
at
the
end
of
the
year,
it
remained
a
part
of
the
corpus.
mr.
fabrice
died
in
1949
about
13
years
after
the
trust
was
established.
at
the
time
of
his
death,
the
trust
corpus
had
a
value
of
some
$275,000,
and
more
than
two-thirds
of
that
was
represented
accumulated
income
during
the
period
the
trust
was
running.
and
i
first
would
like
to
cover
the
position
taken
by
the
commissioner
in
this
case.
it
was
that
the
respondents,
who
just
incidentally
the
executives
or
the
decedent's
estate,
only
reported
the
value
of
the
stocks
and
did
not
report
the
amount
of
the
trust
corpus
in
addition
to
the
stocks.
the
commissioner
will
determine
that
the
entire
value
of
the
existing
trust
corpus
including
the
portion
representing
the
accumulated
income
had
to
be
added
to
the
decedent's
gross
estate
in
order
to
compute
the
tax
and
that's
the
part
where
the
difference
comes.
and
in
reaching
this
conclusion,
the
commissioner
relied
on
section
811
of
the
1939
code
which
provides
in
pertinent
part
that
when
a
gratuitous
inter
vivos
transfers
have
been
made,
the
value
of
the
property
at
the
decedent's
death,
shall
be
included
in
his
estate
if
the
decedent
in
fact
retain
for
his
lifetime,
“the
right,
either
alone
or
in
conjunction
with
any
person
to
designate
the
persons
who
shall
possess
or
enjoy
the
property
or
the
income
therefrom”,
the
commissioner's
quote.
it
was
the
commissioner's
view
that
mr.
fabrice
has
retention
of
the
power
to
determine
along
with
his
co-trustee
whether
to
distribute
or
accumulate
trust
income
was
equivalent
to
the
joint
right
to
determine
who
shall
possess
or
enjoy
the
property
or
the
income
which
section
811
speaks
about.
as
long
as
mr.
fabrice
held
the
power
to
accumulate
trust
income,
he
could
postpone
or
eliminate
enjoyment
of
the
property
by
the
income
beneficiary,
to
the
extent
that
income
was
accumulated
into
the
trust,
it
would
be
shifted
to
the
remainder-men
whoever
they
might
turn
out
to
be,
and
in
this
case
it
would
be
in
each
trust
according
to
whether
it
was
the
widow
or
the
daughters.
however,
the
district
court
while
in
general
agreement
with
the
commissioner's
view
that's
--
there
was
no
question
i
think
from
anybody
that
section
811
governs,
but
the
district
court
held
that
only
the
value
of
the
trust
principle
representing
the
original
corpus
could
be
taxed.
that
was
the
original
shares
of
stock,
that
none
of
the
accumulated
income
should
be
included.
the
portion
of
the
trust
corpus
representing
accumulated
income
was
specifically
eliminated
and
the
district
court
said
in
its
opinion
quite
clearly
that
he
was
not
in
agreement
with
it
but
he
was
bound
by
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
prior
case
of
commissioner
versus
mcdermott's
estate.
and
when
the
case
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
reluctantly
followed
its
previous
opinion.
and
on
rehearing
on
the
theory
of
the
panel
rules
of
the
court
of
appeals
etcetera,
it's
quite
clearly,
reluctantly
decided
to
follow
their
rule
rather
than
the
decision
of
the
first
circuit.
and
so
as
the
case
comes
here,
there
are
the
mcdermott
case,
this
case,
and
one
case
from
the
sixth
circuit
on
one
side,
and
the
first
circuit
on
the
other
side.
and
the
only
question
presented
below
and
the
sole
question
here
is
whether
section
811,
which
concededly
requires
that
the
original
trust
principal
be
included,
and
that's
included
in
the
decedent's
gross
estate,
whether
it
also
requires
an
accumulated
income
to
be
included.
now,
what
the
seventh
circuit
has
decided
is
quite
interesting
but
i
submit
that
does
not
hold
one
of
them
because,
and
incidentally,
the
other
side
did
not
appeal
from
that
portion
of
the
seventh
circuit
which
held
that
these
stocks
went
in,
there's
no
question
about
the
shares
of
stocks.
but
that
the
income
that
came
from
dividends
from
that
stock,
it's
their
position
that
is
not
included
and
it's
based
of
the
fact
of
the
language
which
i
will
get
to
of
the
811.
but
the
very
theory,
it
seems
to
me,
does
not
bear
on
this
particular
case.
this
was
a
closed
type
corporation.
and
the
original
shares
of
stock
will
put
in
each
of
the
trusts.
subsequent
to
that,
dividends
were
declared
and
that
dividends
were
used
to
purchase
additional
shares
of
stock
in
the
same
corporation,
though
there
were
other
investments
made.
some
of
the
money
was
given
directly
to
the
beneficiaries.
now,
we're
at
the
very
interesting
point
that
if
the
stock
had
remained
and
that
no
dividends
have
been
declared,
that
would
be
one
thing.
there's
no
question
that
goes
there.
if
the
money
has
been
put
in
a
savings
account,
i
doubt
if
anybody
would
question
that
the
interest
went
along.
whatever
went
along
with
the
shares
of
trust,
anyway
you
read
the
language
of
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me,
at
least
and
to
the
government
to
be
reasonable
in
the
language
of
transfer.
we
of
course
say
it
comes
under
the
section
of
the
code
that
bears
on
the
question
of
transfer,
sure.
each
time
this
dividend
--
these
dividends
were
declared,
the
trustee
under
--
the
three
trustees,
the
settlor
and
two
individual
trustees,
had
the
right
to
determine
what
we
would
do
with
these
dividends
from
this
controlled
corporation.
and
they
decided
the
most
times,
“we
will
leave
it
in
the
corpus.
we'll
buy
different
shares,
or
we'll
do
that
or
we'll
do
this”.
and
then
as
i
have
mentioned
before,
sometimes
they
said,
“well,
we'll
give
a
part
of
it
to
the
individual
beneficiary”.
so
that
i
don't
think
there's
much
dispute
about
anything
other
than
this
accumulated
income.
now,
we
test
the
seventh
circuit's
view
against
various
situations.
we'll
find
that
you
get
some
rather
startling
results.
for
example,
as
i
understand
that
in
the
--
the
easiest
one
for
me
at
least,
under
the
seventh
circuit's
rule,
if
you
have
coupons
on
the
particular
instruments
and
you
don't
cash
them
in
and
it
ended
by
the
question
that
they
day
went
into
the
gross
estate
under
811.
but
if
you
did
cash
them
in
under
the
seventh
circuit's
ruling
that
interest
would
not
go
onto
the
gross
--
go
into
the
gross
estate
under
811.
suppose
all
the
outstanding
shares
of
the
corporation
were
worth
$10,000
and
they
were
transferred
to
a
trust
similar
to
this
trust,
and
assume
that
the
corporation
then
are
in
$10,000
but
declared
no
dividends,
at
the
settlor's
death,
the
value
of
the
stock,
all
things
being
equal,
be
worth
$20,000.
the
respondents,
and
indeed
the
seventh
circuit,
would
not
dispute
to
this
total
of
$20,000
would
have
to
be
included
in
the
decedent's
gross
estate.
however,
under
the
seventh
circuit,
if
the
$10,000
earned
by
the
corporation
had
been
paid
out
as
dividends
and
been
accumulated
in
the
trusts
rather
than
in
the
corporation,
the
result
under
the
seventh
circuit
would
be
--
it
would
only
be
$10,000
left.
and
the
statute
itself
is
set
out
in
our
brief
on
pages
--
was
it
three?
two
and
three,
and
on
that,
i
think
that
if
we
look
at
the
statute
itself,
you
find
that
providing
the
extent
of
any
interest
therein
of
which
decedent
has
at
anytime
made
a
transfer
by
trust
or
otherwise
under
which
he
has
retained
for
his
life
or
for
any
period
not
ascertainable
without
reference
to
his
death,
or
etcetera,
which
does
not
in
fact
end
before
his
death,
and
then
the
final
point,
the
right
either
alone
or
in
conjunction
with
any
person,
to
designate
the
person
who
shall
possess
or
enjoy
the
property
or
the
income
thereon.
in
this
particular
case,
if
the
settlor
had
added
to
each
one
of
the
trusts,
shares
of
stock
and
the
favored
corporation,
then
there's
no
question
that
would
go
into
the
trust
estate.
but
this
case,
their
dividends
were
declared
and
dividends
were
used
to
pass
and
buy
additional
shares
of
stock
and
they
say
that
is
not
included
in
the
estate.
even
if
that
could
be
reasonably
true
in
an
independent
corporation,
it
suddenly
wouldn't
be
true
in
a
tightly
controlled
corporation.
thus,
this
one
was
and
everybody
admits
if
there's
any
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
a
controlled
corporation,
the
stipulation
in
this
case
covers
all
of
that.
but
there
are
at
least
two
ways
in
which
this
section
811
can
be
read,
to
reach
the
reasonable
and
common
sense
interpretation
which
we
are
supporting.
one
such
reading
turns
on
the
scope
of
word
“property”
and
the
other
is
on
the
word
“transfer”
and
we
agree
that
those
are
the
only
two
positions
that
directly
would
control
our
case.
and
taking
the
word
“property”
first,
what
does
the
statute
mean
when
it
says
“all
property”
and
that
all
is
in
quotes?
if
the
statute
meant
only
the
exact
physical
asset
originally
transferred,
it
called
more
simply
to
say
just
that.
rather,
we
believe,
it
must
mean
that
the
physical
asset
and
the
entire
bundle
of
rights
attached
to
this
physical
asset
must
pass
into
the
gross
estate.
this
would
include
all
of
the
income
generated
by
the
physical
asset
originally
transferred.and
skipping
to
the
last
part
of
the
statute,
we
see
that
it
refers
to
“the
property
of
the
income
therefrom”.
therefrom,
over
which
the
decedent
had
a
prescribed
power
at
the
time
of
his
death.
we
think
that
all
property
in
the
first
clause
has
intended
to
encompass
all
property,
principal
accumulated
income
and
as
to
which
that
the
decedent
retains
control
up
to
the
time
of
his
death.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
thank
you
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
we
recessed
yesterday,
i
had
covered
the
fact
that
the
dissident
during
his
lifetime
had
set
up
these
trusts
and
as
to
the
disposition
to
be
made
of
these
trusts
and
pointed
out
that
in
the
trust
instruments
themselves,
the
dissident
and
his
co-trustees
retained
the
power
over
the
disposition
of
the
trust
income.
and
i
also
pointed
out
that
it
appeared
to
be
conceded
that
the
corpus
of
the
trusts,
the
original
stocks
were
admittedly
covered
under
section
811
of
the
1939
code
and
that
under
that
statute
the
value
of
the
dissident's
debts
and
the
shares
of
stock
which
constitute
this
original
trust
should
be
lumped
in.
and
that
the
only
point
was
whether
or
not
what
had
accumulated
as
a
result
of
the
holding
of
the
stock
was
to
be
included
in
the
dissident's
estate
as
you
read
section
811.
the
seventh
circuit
said
the
original
corpus
went
into
the
gross
estate
but
the
accumulated
interest
stocks
and
whatever
you
might
call
it,
did
not
come
under
811
and
it's
the
government's
position
that
this
was
clear
error
because
it
was
more
in
line
with
the
purpose
of
811
to
include
all
in
the
dissident's
gross
estate.
the
reason
for
that
is
two-fold
and
we
take
the
position
that
when
the
statute
says,
“all
property”,
it
meant
just
that.
that
the
stocks
that
were
included
were
put
into
the
trust
and
they
were
not
actually
transferred
until
after
the
dissident's
death.
the
real
point
of
dispute
or
the
word
“transfer”
is
that
the
taxpayer
says
that
the
transfer
occurred
when
the
trust
was
set
up.
it's
our
position
that
the
transfer
did
not
actually
occur
until
the
dissident's
death.
and
we
say
also
that
the
property
normally
would
include
whatever
came
about
as
a
result
of
the
action
of
the
trustees,
the
three
trustees
including
the
dissident.
when
the
dividends
were
declared
on
the
stock
of
this
tightly
owned
corporation,
if
the
dividends
remained
there
that
would
be
one
thing
in
cash.
instead
of
leaving
all
of
them
there,
some
were
distributed,
other
dividends
were
used
to
purchase
additional
stock.
the
position
it
seems
to
me
is
untenable
that
the
--
for
example,
suppose
a
dissident
prior
of
course
to
his
death
had
used
the
money
to
purchase
some
other
stock.
that
would
be
one
thing.
suppose
the
dissident
during
his
lifetime
had
transferred
additional
shares
of
his
tightly
owned
corporation
to
the
trust
it
would
be
almost
unthinkable
that
you
could
draw
a
line
between
those
two
sets
of
stocks.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
appears
so
simple
to
me
that
the
statute
mean
to
what
it
says
because
if
you
will
notice
neither
brief
has
any
discussion
of
the
legislative
history
and
we
were
hard
push
to
find
legislative
history
on
this
exact
point,
it's
just
not
there.
the
earliest
is
back
in
the
19
--
the
69th
congress
in
the
first
session.
the
old
1926
act
but
it
just
mentions
it,
there's
no
argument.
i've
--
the
government
takes
the
position
that
all
property
means
“all
property”
and
you
can't
draw
the
line.
and
finally,
i
would
mention
that
the
dispute
between
the
--
the
sixth
circuit
agrees
with
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
first
circuit
and
the
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
at
the
footnote
--
on
page
5.
the
first
circuit
went,
although,
it's
under
the
later
statute
which
is
section
20
--
2036,
the
language
is
so
practically
identical
with
the
first
one.
and
we
submit
that
the
first
circuit
is
correct
that
the
seventh
circuit
is
in
error
and
we
urged
the
court
to
reverse
the
seventh
circuit
and
make
it
clear
that
in
construing
section
811,
which
is
now
2036,
it
includes
all
the
property
and
not
to
dividing
between
what
was
given
133
years
ago
and
what
exists
at
the
time
of
dissident's
death.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
to
--
each
one
of
the
--
only
to
the
beneficiaries.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
he--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh,
it's
just
the
income,
was
just
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
the
income
as
i
remember.
was
it
just
the
income?
yes,
sir,
as
i
remember
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
everybody
agrees
that
the
original
shares
of
stock
go
in.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
and
that's
the
control
that
we
say
was
there.
he
had
the
control.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
exactly
it
and
yet
they
put
one
in
and
left
the
other
out.
and
the
petitioner
did
not
--
rather
the
respondent
has
not
at
all
in
anyway
attacked
that
portion
of
the
seventh
circuit's
decision.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
may
it
please
the
court.
i
only
have
one
point
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
and
that's
the
church
and
other
cases
and
we
are
in
complete
disagreement
because
as
i
read
church
it
stand
from
the
proposition
that
where
the
settlor
--
whether
he
--
when
he
can
--
when
he
maintains
control
to
the
extent
of
being
able
to
distribute,
he
is
in
for
tax
purposes,
he's
in
the
same
category
as
if
he
was
able
to
use
the
money
himself.
that's
what
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no.
oh,
it's
definitely
in
the
church
case.
yes,
sir.
that's
correct
but
i
mean
the
language
seems
to
me
to
draw
no
the
difference
between
the
two.
and
in
this
case,
he
had
the
right
to
decide,
when
i
say
“he”
i
mean,
he
and
the
other
two
trustees,
had
the
right
to
decide
what
they
were
going
to
do
with
this
money
and
whether
they
were
going
to
give
it
to
the
beneficiaries
or
not.
they
couldn't
give
it
to
anybody.
but
they
had
the
right
to
give
it
to
the
beneficiary
not
--
we
think
its
sufficient
control.
