mr.
leon
fieldman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
i
review
just
for
a
moment
or
two
some
the
salient
facts
with
regard
to
these
five
trusts
created
by
the
taxpayer,
but
now
deceased
taxpayer.
these
trusts
were
created
in
december
and
january,
december
of
1936
and
january
of
1937.
each
of
the
trust
was
irrevocable.
the
settlor
did
not
have
the
right
to
alter,
amend,
revoke
or
terminate
any
of
the
trusts.
the
settlor
did
not
reserve
a
life
income
interest
in
any
of
the
trusts.
the
settlor
was
not
a
remainder
man
under
any
of
the
trusts
and
the
settlor
had
no
right
of
reversion
under
any
of
the
trusts.
the
only
right,
the
only
narrow
right
that
the
settlor
had
here
was
a
right
which
he
could
exercise
along
with
two
other
trustees
because
he
was
one
of
the
three
trustees
of
each
trust.
and
that
narrow
right
was
this,
that
although
each
trust
agreement
specified
that
the
trust
income
was
to
be
paid
to
the
trust
beneficiary,
the
three
trustees
voting
together
could
vote
to
retain
a
portion
of
the
trust
income
and
add
it
to
the
trust
principle.
once
it
became
a
portion
of
the
trust
principle,
it
was
then
distributed
with
the
trust
principle
when
the
trust
terminated.
that
was
the
only
right
that
the
settlor
had
and
this
was
a
right
as
one
of
three
co-trustees.
mr.
leon
fieldman
yes,
your
honor.
there
was,
again,
exercised
all
by
all
three
co-trustees.
now
when
these
trusts
were
first
created,
the
settlor
transferred
to
them
shares
of
stock
as
the
solicitor
general
stated.
from
that
time
on
until
the
settlor's
death,
13
years
later,
there
were
no
further
transfers
by
the
settlor
to
the
trustees
of
the
trust.
during
those
13
years
of
course,
the
trust
earned
income.
and
approximately
as
the
record
shows,
approximately
50%
of
the
income
over
the
years
was
either
paid
out
to
the
trust
beneficiaries
or
used
to
pay
income
tax
payable
by
the
trust.
the
remaining
approximate
50%
of
the
trust
income
was
directed
by
the
trustees
to
be
added
to
trust
principle.
now,
the
taxpayer
did
concede
below
that
this
power
to
accumulate
trust
income
which
the
settlor
admittedly
had
in
conjunction
with
his
two
co-trustees,
did
make
the
corpus,
the
original
transferred
corpus
of
the
trust
taxable
in
the
taxpayer's
estate
on
the
theory
that
under
section
811
(c)
he
had
the
right
to
designate
the
persons
who
could
possess
or
enjoy
the
property.
that
is
by
paying
out
the
income
immediately,
the
trust
beneficiaries
got
it.
if
however
the
income
was
accumulated
and
added
a
trust
principle,
conceivably
somebody
other
than
the
income
beneficiary
might
get
it
because
in
some
cases,
the
income
beneficiary's
death
did
not
terminate
the
trust
and
the
principle
might
therefore
go
to
the
income
beneficiary's
children
or
grandchildren.
so
we
concede
that
this
right
to
accumulate
or
to
distribute
income
does
make
the
principle
taxable
in
the
settlor's
estate
under
section
811
(c).
the
question
here
is,
was
the
income
earned
by
these
irrevocable
trusts
during
the
13
years
between
their
creation
and
the
settlor's
death?
was
that
income
transferred
by
the
settlor
to
the
trusts
and
thus
subject
to
taxation
pursuant
to
the
language
of
section
811.
the
taxpayer
submits
basically
three
points
that
under
the
statutory
language
that
income
is
not
taxable
because
it
was
not
transferred
by
the
settlor
to
the
trust.
second,
the
doctrine
of
an
incomplete
transfer
mentioned
this
morning
by
the
solicitor
general
has
no
application
of
this
case.
the
transfers
to
the
trust
in
1936
and
1937
were
complete
when
made.
nothing
more
had
to
be
done.
the
doctrine
of
an
incomplete
transfer
as
i
will
expound
on
later
was
first
enunciated
in
cases
which
can
have
no
application
to
the
fact
situation
here.
and
thirdly,
the
decision
below
is
correct
and
should
be
affirmed
because
an
affirmance
of
the
decision
below
does
not
create
any
tax
in
full
of
any
kind
large
or
small
as
the
government
has
argued
both
orally
and
in
it's
brief.
now,
first
is
to
the
statutory
language
--
mr.
leon
fieldman
the
answer
to
that
mr.
chief
justice
is
this.
that
under
a
decision
of
a
court
of
appeals
some
years
ago,
it
was
held
that
if
a
settlor
retains
the
right
over
property
which
he
has
transferred
and
in
this
case
the
property
he
has
transferred
must
be
the
original
corpus.
if
he
retains
the
right
to
accumulate
or
distribute
the
income
arising
from
that
corpus
then
he
has
in
effect
retained
a
right
over
the
corpus
itself.
since
the
income
is
the
fruit
of
the
corpus
if
he
can
designate
those
to
possess
or
enjoy
the
fruit
then
he
in
effect
has
retained
the
power
over
the
corpus
which
makes
the
corpus
taxable
in
his
estate.
our
position
is
conceding
that
point
that
even
though
he
does
have
the
right
to
designate
who
is
to
receive
the
income.
that
income
is
not
taxable
in
his
estate
for
this
reason
that
the
statute
requires
that
what
is
to
be
taxed
in
the
dissident's
estate
must
have
been
transferred
by
the
dissident.
and
our
position
is
that
under
any
normal
concept
of
property
law,
you
cannot
--
a
settlor
cannot
transfer
income
which
at
the
time
it's
earned
by
the
trust
within
13
years
after
his
death
belongs
only
to
the
trusts,
is
received
only
by
them.
he
has
no
right
to
sell
it.
he
cannot
give
it
away.
he
has
no
rights
at
all
insofar
as
transfer
is
concerned
over
the
income.
and
that
is
the
point
mr.
chief
justice
which
i
now
like
to
expound
further.
that
has
to
do
with
the
requirement
of
the
statute.
mr.
leon
fieldman
correct.
mr.
leon
fieldman
that's
correct.
mr.
leon
fieldman
the
answer
to
that
mr.
chief
justice
lies
in
the
statute
itself.
mr.
leon
fieldman
the
statute
has
not
one
but
two
requirements
for
taxability.
the
government
of
course
lays
very
heavy
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
the
income
falls
within
one
requirement,
that
is
if
the
settlor
can
designate
those
who
are
to
possess
or
enjoy
the
income.
and
that's
the
second
requirement,
the
right
to
designate
those
who
possess
or
enjoy
and
we
can
concede
it.
the
settlor
does
have
that
right
and
thus,
the
second
requirement
of
the
statute
is
met.the
first
however
is
not
met.
and
that
first
requirement
stated
very
specifically
by
the
statute
is
that
the
property
to
be
taxed
must
have
been
transferred
by
the
settlor.
and
it's
our
position
that
the
income
was
never
transferred
by
the
settlor.
he
transferred
only
the
property.
he
could
not
transfer
the
income
because
it
was
never
earned
and
perhaps
never
would
have
been
earned
at
the
time
he
transferred
it.
in
subsequent
years
when
the
income
was
earned,
it
became
--
since
these
were
irrevocable
trusts
which
she
could
not
alter,
amend
or
revoke,
that
income
become
the
property
of
the
trusts.
the
settlor
never
owned
that
income
and
therefore
he
could
never
transfer
it.
so,
with
the
statute
--
mr.
leon
fieldman
yes,
your
honor.
that
in
our
position
is
no
different
than
had
trust
income
then
put
in
a
bank
account.
now,
if
both
requirements
of
the
statute
are
not
met,
if
there
is
no
transfer
in
the
first
instance
then
whatever
is
not
transferred
cannot
be
taxed.
and
i
think
this
simple
example
might
serve
to
illustrate
that.
assuming
in
this
irrevocable
trust
the
third
party
neither
the
beneficiary
nor
the
settlor
had
decided
to
give
a
$100,000
to
the
trustee
to
add
to
the
trust.
this
was
permitted
by
the
trust
agreements.
and
this
third
party
did
give
a
$100,000
which
was
added
to
the
principal
of
the
trust
and
this
$100,000
then
proceeded
to
earn
trust
income.
well
as
to
this
trust
income,
the
settlor
would
have
the
same
rights.
he
could
direct
that
it'd
be
paid
out
or
it
could
direct
that
it
be
accumulated.
thus,
he
had
the
right
to
designate
the
person's
who
would
--
were
to
possess
or
enjoy
the
income
from
that
$100,000.
certainly,
we
would
concede
that
but
i
don't
think
anybody
would
argue
that
the
$100,000
is
to
be
included
in
the
settlor's
estate.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
first
requirement
of
the
statute
was
never
met.
that
$100,000
was
never
transferred
by
the
settlor
to
the
trusts.
and
of
course,
the
same
principle
applies
as
to
the
income
earned
by
the
trust
not
by
the
settlor
after
creation
of
the
trusts.
now
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
statute
clearly
spills
out
these
two
requirements,
only
one
of
which
has
met
as
to
the
income,
the
statutory
language
also
it
appears
indicates
quite
clearly
that
income
was
never
meant
to
be
taxed
and
there's
two
reasons
for
this.
the
first
reason
is
this,
the
statute
when
talking
about
transfers
by
the
settlor
has
an
exception.
it
says,
except
in
the
case
of
a
bona
fide
sale
for
an
adequate
and
full
consideration
in
one-year
money's
worth.
or
if
you
try
to
apply
that
exception
of
this
trust
income
earned
during
the
13
years
after
the
irrevocable
trust
were
created.
he
realized
that
it
can
have
no
meaning
with
regard
to
that
trust
income.
that
trust
income
was
never
subject
to
sale
by
the
settlor
either
bona
fide
or
otherwise
for
an
adequate
or
for
consideration
because
that
income
belonged
to
the
trusts
not
to
the
settlor.
he
could
never
have
sold
that
and
if
the
exception
on
the
statute
is
to
be
read
as
having
any
meaning
at
all.
it
must
mean
that
what
was
transferred
or
what
was
subject
to
transfer
by
the
settlor
must
have
at
one
time
been
owned
by
the
settlor
and
transferred
by
him.
if
it
was
not
owned
by
him,
it
could
not
be
transferred
by
him
and
that's
the
case
as
to
this
income.
that
being
so
the
exception
is
meaningless.
the
statute
is
cited
at
page
2
of
the
taxpayer's
brief.
the
second
statutory
support
for
the
taxpayer's
position
is
also
to
be
found
on
this
few
sentences
of
the
statute.
remembering
that
the
statute
has
two
requirements;
one,
that
there
be
a
transfer
by
the
settlor;
and
two,
that
the
settlor
have
the
right
to
designate
those
who
shall
possess
or
enjoy
the
property.
and
then
reading
the
statute
you'll
find
that
when
the
word
transfer
is
used
in
the
third
line
of
the
statute
as
cited
on
page
2
of
the
taxpayer's
brief.
the
word
property
was
used,
“transferred
property
spoken
of.”
there
is
no
reference
to
income
when
there's
a
talk
about
transfer.
but
when
the
second
requirement
of
the
statute
is
dealt
with,
on
the
very
last
line
of
the
cited
statute
that
is
where
the
settlor
is
said
to
have
the
power
to
designate
those
who
shall
possess
or
enjoy.
at
that
point,
the
statute
says
the
property
or
the
income
there
from.
there's
no
reference
to
the
income
in
the
transferring
section
of
the
statute.
and
the
reason
for
that
i
think
is
very
simple
that
it
was
not
the
conversion
or
intention
to
consider
income
which
might
never
be
earned
at
the
time
a
settlor
creates
an
irrevocable
transfer.
they
considered
that
income
as
having
been
transferred
by
the
settlor.
the
property
can
be
transferred,
yes,
but
the
income
when
it
is
earned
and
in
an
irrevocable
trust
is
not
the
settlor's
to
transfer.
now,
the
second
reason
why
we
feel
that
the
seventh
circuit,
and
the
sixth
circuit,
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
burns
case,
there
are
three
circuits
in
effect
which
have
held
these
are
correct
and
why
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed
as
this.
and
this
is
in
the
sense
of
a
negative
reason.
the
government
argues
that
this
transfer
when
made
to
the
trust
13
years
before
the
settlor's
death
was
not
a
complete
transfer.
it
became
complete
only
when
he
died
because
he
retained
this
right
over
the
property
and
if
it
became
complete
only
then.
then
all
of
the
income
which
was
added
to
the
trust
during
these
13
years
also
remained
the
settlor's
until
his
death
and
therefore
was
transferred
when
he
died.
this
doctrine
of
an
incomplete
transfer
has
arisen
primarily
in
three
cases
decided
by
this
court.
one
was
the
church
and
these
cases
are
cited
on
both
grounds.
one
was
the
church
estate.
there
this
court
said
that
the
transfer
by
the
settlor
to
an
irrevocable
trust
was
incomplete,
it
did
not
become
complete
until
he
died
and
i
concede
that
so.
in
the
church
estate
however,
mr.
church
retained
for
his
life
the
right
to
receive
the
income
from
the
trusts.
so,
obviously
as
a
matter
of
economics
he
had
given
away
nothing
of
value
to
the
trust.
he
retained
all
the
benefit
of
the
trust
during
his
lifetime.
and
i
think
it's
quite
logical
therefore
to
say
that
those
transfers
to
the
trust
became
complete
only
when
mr.
church
died.
but
remember
here
that
this
is
a
trust
in
which
the
settlor
has
retained.
no
income
interest
at
all.
the
second
case
which
announces
this
incomplete
doctrine
is
the
rainey
case.
there
are
two
this
court
said
that
the
transfer
was
incomplete
until
the
settlor's
death.
but
there
the
settlor
retained
the
right
to
terminate
the
trust
at
anytime.
there's
no
such
right
here.
this
trust
cannot
be
altered,
amended
or
revoked,
or
terminated.
and
the
third
case
was
the
holmes
case.
there
too,
there
was
a
right
of
termination
which
does
not
exist
here.
this
transfer
to
the
trust
was
as
complete
as
it
was
possible
to
make
it
in
1936
or
1937.
mr.
leon
fieldman
there's
no
reversionary
right
of
any
kind.
mr.
leon
fieldman
none.
therefore,
we
say
while
this
doctrine
of
an
incomplete
transfer
makes
sense
in
the
cases
in
which
it
was
announced.
it
shouldn't
be
stretched
and
tortured
to
fit
the
facts
here
where
you
have
an
irrevocable,
unalterable
trust
with
no
rights
retained
in
the
settlor
to
benefit
himself.
mr.
leon
fieldman
that's
correct.
mr.
leon
fieldman
for
emergency
purposes
your
honor.
mr.
leon
fieldman
in
the
interest
of
the
beneficiary
only.
that
appears
on
page
25
as
to
one
--
page
25
of
the
record,
about
two-thirds
the
way
down
the
page.
extra
funds
for
providing
education,
children
being
in
need,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
and
that
same
principle
of
invasion
clause
appears
in
each
of
the
other
trust.
so
then,
the
taxpayer
contends
that
this
transfer
to
the
trust
is
not
covered
by
the
statutory
language.
that
the
doctrine
of
an
incomplete
transfer
has
no
application
here;
and
third,
that
there
is
no
loophole
that
will
be
either
created
or
enlarged
by
an
affirmance
of
the
decision
below.
the
loophole
which
the
government
suggests
is
this,
that
a
clever
taxpayer
taking
advantage
of
this
case
might
create
an
irrevocable
trust
of
this
type,
transferred
to
at
his
stock
and
a
closely
held
corporation,
have
dividends
paid
to
the
trust,
have
the
trustees
accumulate
that
trust
income
and
the
trust,
and
then
when
the
taxpayer
dies
none
of
the
accumulated
income
will
be
subject
to
federal
estate
tax.
well,
if
he
hadn't
been
this
clever
and
let
the
income
accumulate
in
his
corporation
the
value
of
his
stock
at
the
time
of
his
death
would
reflect
that
accumulated
income
and
therefore
in
effect,
the
accumulated
income
would
be
taxed
in
his
estate,
that
is
(inaudible).
and
this
says
the
government,
there's
a
loophole
which
must
be
avoided.
but
of
course
the
taxpayer
who
looks
--
protects
loopholes,
is
not
interested
in
saving
federal
estate
tax
at
the
expense
which
he
pay
now
just
as
much
if
not
more
federal
income
tax.
and
that
is
precisely
what
might
happen
if
this
loophole
were
availed
of
by
a
taxpayer
who
i
think
must
be
a
very
unclever
tax
payment.
if
the
corporate
income
is
paid
out
as
dividends
to
an
irrevocable
trust,
that
irrevocable
trust
must
pay
income
tax
on
those
dividends
as
taxpayer
just
like
any
other
single,
unmarried
taxpayers.
well,
if
those
corporate
dividends
are
not
declared
but
are
retained
on
the
corporation,
there
is
no
income
tax
under
the
normal
situation.
so
while
it's
true
that
the
estate
tax
conceivably
maybe
avoided
by
the
estate,
income
tax
must
necessarily
be
incurred
and
the
income
tax,
of
course,
is
paid
during
one's
lifetime.
the
federal
estate
tax
only
after
one
is
dead.
income
tax
rates
of
course
are
quite
high
and
it
seems
to
me
that
to
say
that
this
decision
below
has
kind
of
open
the
way
for
tax
avoidance
is
to
be
highly
unrealistic.
i
just
don't
see
that
any
taxpayer
would
want
to
do
that.
so
for
each
of
these
three
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
decision
below
is
correct.
the
statutory
language
has
two
requirements.
one
of
them
is
that
there
must
be
a
transfer
by
the
settlor.
the
income
here
was
not
transferred
by
the
settlor.
the
second
is
that
the
doctrine
of
an
incomplete
transfer
has
no
bearing
upon
this
case
because
this
is
an
irrevocable
trust
which
cannot
be
altered,
amended
or
revoked
and
the
settlor
has
retained
no
income
interest,
no
remainder
interest
and
no
reversion
of
interest.
and
thirdly,
affirmance
of
the
decision
below
will
not
open
or
enlarge
any
tax
in
the
form
of
any
nature.
mr.
leon
fieldman
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
that
--
mr.
leon
fieldman
it
would
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leon
fieldman
yes.
mr.
leon
fieldman
that's
correct
your
honor.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
this,
so
of
course,
the
gift
tax
law
differentiates
between
present
interest
and
future
interest
gifts.
if
i
give
three
--
mr.
leon
fieldman
that's
correct.
mr.
leon
fieldman
no,
i
don't
argue
as
to
the
gift
tax
at
all.
i
think
that's
--
mr.
leon
fieldman
well
--
mr.
leon
fieldman
the
reason
for
that
your
honor
is
the
difference
between
the
estate
tax
and
the
gift
tax
law.
they
are
substantially
different
and
the
gift
tax
law
has
--
mr.
leon
fieldman
it's
exactly
my
point.
mr.
leon
fieldman
correct.
mr.
leon
fieldman
well
--
mr.
leon
fieldman
first,
for
this
reason
section
811
(c)
dealing
with
the
transfer
of
course
refers
only
to
the
federal
estate
tax.
the
gift
taxation
arises
under
entirely
different
sections
of
the
code
and
of
course,
it
does
require
a
transfer
by
the
settlor
in
order
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leon
fieldman
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
fieldman
i
think
the
answer
to
that
mr.
chief
justice
is
this,
that
whenever
a
income
producing
asset
is
transferred,
the
transfer
must
necessarily
carry
with
it
the
right
to
receive
future
income
payments.
mr.
leon
fieldman
to
receive
income
payments
in
the
future
on
that
transferred
asset.
that
very
point
however
--
mr.
leon
fieldman
yes.
mr.
leon
fieldman
and
his
two
co-trustees.
mr.
leon
fieldman
and
this
two
co-trustees.
mr.
leon
fieldman
that
point
incidentally
i
would
like
to
dwell
on
for
just
a
moment
more.
i
have
cited
--
the
taxpayer
has
cited
in
his
brief
a
case
which
was
cited
for
one
proposition
but
i
think
it
is
very
important
for
this
exact
point
and
that's
on
page
13
of
the
taxpayer's
brief,
maass
versus
higgins
which
is
cited
in
the
second
line
from
the
bottom
of
the
page.
that
case
has
an
importance,
an
entirely
different
importance
and
that
is
this.
in
that
case
a
taxpayer,
this
also
involved
in
a
estate,
took
the
option
of
taxing
estate
assets
one
year
after
a
death,
that
is
an
option
in
the
federal
estate
tax
law,
you
can
either
tax
the
assets
or
value
the
assets
as
of
the
date
of
death
or
one
year
after
death.
and
in
that
case
the
estate
took
the
option
of
valuing
one
year
after
death.
and
the
commissioner
of
the
internal
revenue
said,
“well,
if
you
value
one
year
after
death
you
got
and
not
include
the
assets
as
of
one
year
after
death
but
also
all
income
earned
from
the
date
of
death
until
the
one
year
after
death.”
and
this
court
said,
“no,
that's
improper.
you
don't
do
that.
you
value
only
the
assets
one
year
after
death
and
not
the
income
earn
in
the
interim.”
and
the
course
of
its
opinion
that
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
the
decision,
“nor
does
the
promise
to
pay
interest
(or
subdivided)
which
is
not
been
legally
separated
from
the
asset
of
which
it
is
an
incident
have
any
market
value
apart
from
the
asset
or
bear
any
invariable
relation
to
the
value
of
the
capital
asset.”
the
court
also
said
that,
conceding
that
a
bond
may
involve
both
the
principle
and
the
promise
to
pay
income
on
the
principle.
nonetheless,
when
the
principle
is
to
be
taxed
you
do
not
assume
that
the
income
to
be
earned
thereafter
is
also
to
be
taxed.
and
i
think
that
principle
applies
very
clearly
here.
the
principle
is
transferred
and
the
principle
is
to
be
taxed
but
you
do
not
assume
that
the
right
which
accompanies
the
transfer
of
the
principle
is
to
be
valued
separately
and
separately
taxed.
and
that's
the
teaching
of
maass
v.
higgins
which
is
i
say
was
not
cited
for
that
purpose
in
the
brief
but
i
think
it's
very
applicable
to
this
question
of
the
bundle
of
rights.
