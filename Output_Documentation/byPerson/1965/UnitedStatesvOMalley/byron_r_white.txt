are
the
--
have
accumulations
of
the
income
is
accumulated
in
adequate
form
or
has
that
--
then
suggest
as
though
a
gift
tax
or
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
another
case,
it
says,
it
has
the
--
commissioner
claims
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
these
accumulations
are
subject
to
gift
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
theory
that
--
that
he
didn't
make
a
transfer
when
he
had
--
when
he
added
the
principles
instead
of
distributing.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless
whether
they
do
or
they
don't
it's
--
the
gift
tax
would
be
based
on
the
assumption
that
there
was
a
transfer.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
you
deny?
so
you
would
say
there
should
be
no
gift
tax
whatsoever?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
--
why
is
that?
i
mean,
how
can
this
fellow
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
make
the
transfer
if
he
hasn't
anything
to
transfer?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
transfer
doesn't
mean
that
in
--
for
gift
tax
purposes
or
is
the
same
as
it
does
for
estate
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
let's
just
say
--
let's
just
--
you
just
(inaudible)
--
you're
relying
on
the
fact
that
the
words
of
the
statute
seem
to
require
an
anterior
transfer.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
and
why
is
that
different
in
a
--
than
the
kind
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
of
a
transfer
necessary
to
precipitate
gift
tax
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
it
--
the
--
you
--
you
do
--
you
do
concede
then
that
the
settlor
here,
one
of
the
trustees
when
he
make
--
when
he
accumulates
income
and
adds
a
principle
as
an
--
he's
transferring
enough
of
an
interest
it's
attributable
to
him
to
be
subject
to
gift
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
