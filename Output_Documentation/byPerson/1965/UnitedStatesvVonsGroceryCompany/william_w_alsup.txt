mr.
william
w.
alsup
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
always
happens
to
me
when
i
prepare
a
little
outline
and
i
never
get
to
use
it.
i
would
like
to
answer
a
number
of
questions
which
have
been
posed.
the
last
question
from
justice
clark
was
whether
or
not
we
have
statistics
on
new
entries
and
the
answer
was
--
if
he
did
not
believe
we
do.
the
--
excuse
me
to
say
i've
argued
this
case
many
times
at
night,
i
didn't
think
i
would
have
--
i
could
take
my
voice
in
the
day
time.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
we
have
considerable
evidence
concerning
new
entries.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
were
260
new
entries
as
i
recall
in
1960.
there
was
a
net
decline
of
a
132
stores.
now
counsel
attached
considerable
importance
to
the
number
of
decline.
the
number
of
stores
have
declined
over
the
years,
but
it
seems
important
to
me
that
we
look
at
what
did
we
lose
by
the
decline?
now
the
1960
staff
report
to
the
federal
trade
commission,
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
decline
in
the
number
of
stores
from
19
--
nationwide,
from
1939
to
1954
of
over
a
120,000.
that
every
stores
to
the
federal
trade
commission
in
that
group
that
went
out
saw
less
than
50,000
gross
sales
a
year
and
when
we
look
at
our
exhibit
d,
which
is
in
the
record
at
2529,
records
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
w.
alsup
it's
volume
five
your
honors.
2529
--
mr.
william
w.
alsup
this
is
a
letter
from
the
state
board
of
equalization
and
all
of
these
are
not
all
closings
because
the
number
--
they
count
as
a
closing
or
transfer
from
one
to
another.
the
figures
there
are
simply
astounding.
they
show
69
closings
in
the
year
1960
of
grocery
stores
selling
no
more
than
$10,000
a
year.
they
show
98
closings
of
grocery
stores
with
total
sales
of
less
than
20,000
a
year.
they
show
269
closings
with
sales
under
150,000
a
year.
now
even
if
you
assumed
that
operator
could
make
as
much
as
10%
return
as
against
the
1.5
to
2%,
for
the
average
supermarket
or
chain,
assuming
he
could
make
10%
that
would
net
that
man
only
$5000
a
year.
i
might
add
that
the
1960
staff
records
the
federal
trade
commission
or
did
plan
out
with
oligopolistic
client
that
talk
about,
was
in
stores
doing
less
than
50,000
a
year,
nevertheless
stores
with
sales
of
50,000
to
299
increased
from
32,000
to
95,000.
those
with
sales
of
300,000
--
excuse
me,
to
999,000
increased
from
1400
to
15200.
and
those
with
sales
of
1
million
and
over
increased
from
59
to
6242
in
this
15-year
period
the
federal
trade
commission
was
talking
about.
obviously,
the
decline
in
numbers
of
which
the
government
is
concerned
here,
was
in
the
stores
which
they
themselves
in
their
brief,
at
page
31,
refer
to
as
technologically
and
competitively
obsolete.
but
despite
the
decline
in
the
numbers
of
stores
in
the
los
angeles
county,
the
fact
is
and
the
court
found,
each
household
in
the
los
angeles
metropolitan
area,
has
a
choice
from
three
to
ten
stores
within
convenient
shopping
distance.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
on
the
exits?
it's
my
feeling
mr.
justice
clark
that
i
attach
to
the
competitive
market,
is
not
only
ease
of
entry
and
that's
demonstrated
by
this
record,
but
also
ease
of
exit.
the
entrepreneur
opts
to
be
able
to
sale
and
get
out
of
the
business
if
in
so
doing
he
does
not
injure,
he's
not
likely
to
injure
competition.
i
attach
no
real
significance
to
the
decline
in
a
number
of
technologically
obsolete
grocery
store.
in
that
connection,
i
might
mention
justice
clark
that
counsel
referred
to
the
fact
that
safeway's
market
shares
declined
over
the
years
and
that's
true.
and
they
say
that
because
they
were
converging
from
small
stores
to
supermarkets
and
non
on
recurring
factor
they
say.
well
i
don't
see
it
why
the
convergence
would
reduce
safeway's
market
share.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
godfery
lepore
and
chainstorage
points
out
in
1959.
amp
had
15,000
grocery
stores
in
the
united
states
and
did
$1
billion
gross
business.
in
1962,
they
have
4000
and
they
did
5
billion
a
year
in
business.
now,
the
federal
trade
commission
staff
report
to
which
i've
referred
points
out
that
amp's
market
share
has
remained
constant
nationwide
and
at
roughly
10%
of
the
market.
they
say
the
safeway
decline
is
a
nonrecurring
factor.
we
demonstrate
and
the
record
shows,
safeway's
market
share
declined
because
of
the
vigorous
small
competitors
who
are
aggressive
who
have
taken
the
market
share
away
from
safeway
and
there
are
certainly
nothing
here
in
this
record
which
would
indicate
that
that's
a
nonrecurring
factor.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
there's
a
considerable
change
mr.
justice
white.
the
top
20
in
1958,
three
were
fox
markets,
i
believe
it
was
rated
eighth
or
ninth.
mcdaniel's
market
which
held
the
11th
position
and
the
airway
market
which
held
the
20th
position.
in
1961,
all
three
of
those
firms
were
in
bankruptcy.
seven
of
the
top
20
firms
in
1960,
were
either
not
in
existence
at
all
or
had
only
one
store
in
1952.
another
person
who
understands
the
economics
much
better
than
i
did
do,
despite
having
served
once
with
the
temporary
master
in
economic
committee
on
which
justice
douglas
served,
had
pointed
out
that
this
shift
in
range
is
every
fifth
as
much
a
valid
indication
of
the
workability
of
competition
as
concentration
ratios
themselves.
now
our
counsel
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
--
mr.
william
w.
alsup
excuse
me,
i
--
i
can't
honestly
say
with
the
exception
of
fox,
that
there's
been
any
change
in
the
identity
of
the
top
eight
firms
in
1958
as
compared
to
1963.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
top
20
from
1958
had
considerable
change
primarily
due
to
the
bankruptcies
of
fox,
mcdaniel's
and
[inaudible]
mr.
william
w.
alsup
not
at
the
top
eight
your
honor.
but
there
were
changes
in
market
shares
of
the
top
eight.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
among
themselves
on
the
basis
of
the
1958
statistics
that
counsel
relied
upon,
if
this
merger
had
taken
place
in
1958
instead
of
1960
then
von's
would
have
ranked
first
ahead
of
safeway
in
terms
of
market
share
with
8.9.
we
have
the
actual
sales
figures
for
1959
and
for
the
first
six
months
of
1960
which
we
can
project
that
in
the
case
of
safeway's
market
share
in
1960
was
7.9
or
8%.
von's
market
share
was
7.5.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
there
total
market
share
declined
your
honor.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
exhibit
a
your
honor,
page

mr.
william
w.
alsup
2788,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
i'm
sorry,
that
carries
only
to
1960.
it
does
indicate
the
change
between
1958
and
1960.
top
three
as
a
consequence
of
this
merger
increased
from
19%
to
21.5%.
the
top
eight,
from
41
--
i'm
sorry,
35.8
to
41.3.
top
20,
from
54.3
to
53.9
there
was
a
decline.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
we
did
not
have
them
mr.
justice
white.
they
were
not
available.
we
put
into
evidence
however,
what
we
did
have
as
of
march
1964.
i
think
justice
clark
inquired
what
was
the
latest
date
that
evidence
was
introduced
concerning
this
case.
there's
a
stipulation
in
the
record
concerning
certain
facts,
including
number
of
stores
and
so
forth
and
that
was
introduced
in
march
of
1964.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
it
does
not
relate
to
the
question
of
relative
shares
mr.
justice
white
because
we
did
not
have
that.
now,
mr.
posner
very
correctly
said
and
i
agree
with
him
100%,
that
market
shares
are
not
reliable
unless
we
have
a
reliable
universe
by
which
to
determine
the
measurement.
and
i
couldn't
agree
more
but
in
the
reply
brief
which
was
served
upon
us
on
friday
afternoon,
that's
exactly
but
counsel
for
the
government
have
done
for
us.
they
say
that
the
market
share
of
the
leading
concerns
has
increased
on
the
basis
of
some
new
census
figures
just
made
available
to
them.
but
those
are
census
figures
just
for
los
angeles
county,
not
the
aggrieved
section
of
the
country
which
is
los
angeles
and
orange
county.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
the
do
not,
they
say
in
their
brief
your
honor.
so
that
shouldn't
make
any
difference
anyway
because
orange
county
accounts
for
only
10%
of
the
total
grocery
sales
for
the
two.
so,
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
we
change
the
universe.
with
that
respect
and
we
suggest
that
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference.
for
example
of
what
von's
64
stores
after
the
merger
with
shopping
bag.
in
1960,
only
four
were
located
in
orange
county.
alexander's
which
was
one
of
the
top
20,
and
this
is
demonstrated
for
the
record
in
the
affidavits,
had
15
stores
in
1960
and
only
one
of
them
in
orange
county.
hughes
markets,
i
forgot
the
exact
figure
but
it's
12
to
14
markets
in
1960,
none
of
them
in
orange
county
and
the
same
thing
as
to
of
shopper's
markets.
so
when
you
increase
the
market
share
--
if
a
firm
for
example
had
2%
market
share
in
orange
county,
that
in
--
the
l.a.
metropolitan
area
consisting
of
both
counties,
but
no
stores
in
orange
county,
then
obviously
if
you
eliminate
orange
county
as
part
of
your
universe,
we're
going
to
increase
concentration.
we
just
don't
think
that
is
the
proper
approach
to
this
problem.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
the
ones
referred
to
in
the
appendix
of
their
mr.
justice
clark?
mr.
william
w.
alsup
well,
this
is
another
case
of
inaccuracy
that
always
results
mr.
justice
clark
when
you
take
statistics
from
the
federal
trade
commission
without
knowing
a
mark
of
facts.
there
is
a
list
of
the
so-called
14
independent
markets
taken
over
or
concerns,
has
contained
in
the
appendix
at
page
5
of
their
reply
brief.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
the
first
name
listed
is
an
acquisition
of
alpha
beta
by
acme.
that
was
a
market
extension
merge
and
presumably
that
didn't
changed
concentration.
the
third
one
shows
an
acquisition
by
food
giant
markets
of
nine
mcdaniel's
stores
in
1961.
the
mcdaniel's
was
in
bankruptcy
in
1961.
it
was
not
in
existence
in
1964
and
yet
the
chart
shows
down
in
1964,
food
giant
took
over
seven
mcdaniel's
markets.
well
the
facts
are
and
everyone
in
the
industry
in
los
angeles
knows,
food
giant
agreed
to
buy
this
nine
mcdaniel's
markets
out
of
bankruptcy
in
1961
and
then
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
deal,
and
that
fought
and
fought.
and
finally,
it
was
stuck
with
taking
seven
of
the
nine
in
1964
that
there's
a
double
counting,
then
may
show
an
acquisition
by
mayfair
markets
of
a
single
eurway
store.
that
again
was
an
acquisition
out
of
bankruptcy
when
eurway
went
under.
it
shows
an
acquisition
by
mayfair
of
a
single
store
from
alpha
beta.
well
that's
a
single
store
acquisition
from
one
of
the
leading
ten
chain
--
by
one
of
the
leading
ten
chains
from
one
of
the
leading
ten
chains,
and
i
don't
see
how
that
changed
it's
concentration.
moving
down
and
just
charge
it
out
of
the
record,
i
hope
i
may
tell
what
is
common
knowledge
in
the
industry.
it
shows
in
acquisition
by
ralphs
grocery
company
of
imperial
supreme
markets.
imperial
supreme
markets
was
a
discount
store
and
ralphs
was
interested
in
finding
out
that
it'd
be
worthwhile
again
into
the
discount
business.
it
took
over
that
store
for
a
few
months
and
then
disposed
of
it.
the
next
acquisition
of
course
is
a
market
extension
by
food
fair
taking
over
the
back
--
the
remaining
stores
of
bankrupt
fox
markets.
most
of
the
fox
markets
went
to
single
store
operators
and
smaller
chains
but
food
fair
got
the
nuclease.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
that's
a
--
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
william
w.
alsup
food
fair
was
not
doing
business
prior
--
in
this
area
at
all
mr.
justice
clark,
prior
to
its
coming
in
and
taking
over
the
remaining
fox
markets
out
of
the
bankruptcy
--
mr.
william
w.
alsup
that's
right.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
same
with
kroger,
same
with
acme.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
i
think
the
food
fair
was
really
1963
but
before
that
for
several
months,
they
had
been
operating
for
the
bankruptcy
trustee,
the
markets,
while
i
guess
their
entry
was
in
1962.
the
kroger
acquisition
of
market
basket
i
believe
was
late
1962.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
that's
their
first
entry.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
yes,
three
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
three
years.
and
then
when
you
look
at
the
--
mr.
william
w.
alsup
yes.
then
you
look
down
further
and
see
albertsons
getting
greater
all
american.
as
evidenced
in
the
record
that
all
american
started
out
in
1953,
grew
rapidly,
had
financial
problems
and
believe
me
they
did
and
they
sold
out
to
albertsons
which
are
not
previously
done
business
in
this
market.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
it's
a
western
chain
mr.
justice
brennan.
it's
in
idaho,
washington,
utah
and
now
california.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
--
47
and
48,
at
page
3079
of
the
record
mr.
justice
brennan,
volume
6
--
mr.
william
w.
alsup
volume
6.
i
guess
i
almost
needed
a
caddie
to
help
me
bring
the
record
up
to
the
--
the
court.
that
indicates
that
records
of
the
state
board
of
equalization
show
the
19
--
in
1960,
128
grocery
stores
were
opened
in
the
l.a.
metropolitan
area
by
concerns
which
apparently
were
new
entrants.
in
the
same
year,
there
were
a
119
openings
by
concerns
operating
at
least
one
other
store.
the
next
finding
i
think
is
of
particular
significance,
18
of
the
30
government
industry
witnesses
who
are
called
to
testify
in
this
case
and
ten
of
the
defendant's
industry
witnesses
commenced
their
present
business
subsequent
to
the
year
1948.
unlike
philadelphia
bank
mr.
justice
brennan,
these
industry
witnesses
gave
solid
reasons
in
our
opinion
to
support
their
conclusions
that
this
merger
was
not
likely
at
all
substantially
to
lessen
competition
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
i'm
not
sure
it
would
justice
white
--
mr.
william
w.
alsup
no,
i
did
not
think
so.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
as
i
recall
our
brief
mr.
justice
white,
the
only
finding
they
took
issue
with,
in
addition
to
the
ultimate
conclusion,
was
finding
80
which
appears
at
pages
3087
and
3088
of
the
record,
volume
6.
i
think
their
brief
states
that
this
finding
was
prepared
by
counsel,
it
was
not
mentioned
--
mr.
william
w.
alsup
80.
i'm
sorry.
it
said
that
finding
was
prepared
by
counsel,
it
was
not
mentioned
in
the
court's
opinion.
but
they
do
not
mentioned
as
if
the
court
had
a
full
two-day
hearing
to
settle
the
findings
in
which
objections,
numerous
objections
were
raised
for
the
government
to
many
findings
including
this
one
and
the
court
made
this
finding.
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
inquired
whether
the
merger
made
von's
first.
on
the
basis
of
1958
figures,
assuming
their
accuracy,
the
answer
would
be
yes.
they
would
then
have
had
8.9
if
the
merger
had
taken
the
place
then
instead
of
two
years
later,
that's
finding
74,
record
3084.
but
on
the
basis
of
1960
figures
when
the
merger
did
take
place,
safeway
had
8%
and
von's
had
7.5%.
now,
the
government
criticizes
our
use
of
other
than
census
figures.
but
the
fact
is,
the
figures
we
used
were
obtained
by
the
fbi
--
and
from
the
38
leading
chains
in
the
area
and
turned
over
to
us
by
the
government
pursuant
to
court
order.
the
affidavit
of
gerald
harrison,
record
896,
indicates
the
work
that
he
did
in
collecting
actual
sales
figures.
we
say
the
actual
figures
obtained
by
the
fbi
coupled
with
a
stipulated
market
of
2.5
billion
in
1960
and
what
they
say
were
von's-shopping
bag
combined
sales
of
almost
100
million
would
produce
a
market
share
if
that's
correct,
of
only
7.2%
for
von's
and
shopping
bag.
they
variously
referred
to
our
market
share
as
8.9%,
9%
and
almost
10%,
but
we
suggest
they
can't
have
it
both
ways,
they've
stipulated
to
the
2.5
billion
in
area
sales.
we
know
our
sale
--
the
von's-shopping
bag
sales
for
less
than
a
180
million
and
that
does
as
i
say
brings
down
to
7.2%.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
yes
they
do,
mr.
justice
clark.
a
motion
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
made
on
march
25,
1960.
that
was
denied
on
march
28,
1960
and
the
merger
took
place.
the
government
filed
a
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction
to
require
that
the
two
firms,
be
operated
as
if
they
were
separately
and
that
was
denied
by
order
dated
june
1960,
i
don't
have
the
exact
date.
they
have
operated
as
one
unit
since
june
of
1960.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
they
now
call
it
von's-shopping
bag
or
von's'
shopping
bag,
i'm
not
sure.
now,
the
question
really
is
what
was
lost
by
the
merger?
and
what
was
lost
was
a
single
local
chain
which
had
grown
from
a
one-store
operation
in
1930
to
a
38-store
chain
in
1960,
36
of
those
were
in
the
relevant
section
of
the
country
and
had
approximately
a
4%
market
share.
what
were
--
remained
as
competitors,
were
five
of
the
sixth
largest
national
chains
that's
covered
in
finding
75
to
77,
two
multi-state
chains,
lucky
stores
and
mayfair,
17
regional
chains,
that
is
local,
having
ten
or
more
stores
and
i
might
add
seven
of
those
17
where
new
entrants
after
1952,
126
other
chains
and
some
3700
single-store
operators
backed
up
by
huge
cooperative
buying
organizations,
certified
grocers
of
california
and
orange
empire
cooperative.
the
origin
and
the
growth
of
these
cooperatives
is
very
interesting,
we
believe.
it's
traced
in
the
findings,
at
record
3074
to
76,
findings
29
to
38.
before
i
trace
that
i
would
like
to
mention
one
thing
mr.
posner
said,
he
said,
“well
ever
there's
no
need
for
these
two
concerns
to
merge
because
we
admit
both
von's
and
shopping
bag
before
the
merger
could
compete
effectively
with
safeway”
and
we
certainly
did
admit
that.
there
wasn't
any
question
about
it,
nor
is
there
any
question
on
the
basis
of
this
record
and
the
testimony
of
the
industry
witnesses
are
very
representative
cross-section
of
whom
we
think
we
presented
that
the
single-store
operator
can
compete
effectively
with
safeway
because
by
a
membership
and
a
retailer-own
cooperative
buying
organization,
they
get
these
groceries
on
the
shelf
just
as
cheaply
as
a
direct-buying
chain.
we
say,
the
single-store
operators,
the
two-store
operators,
the
two
to
nine
store
in
the
regional
chains
are
all
substantial
competitive
factors.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
our
witnesses,
mr.
w.
h.
crawford,
who
runs
a
single
store
in
el
monte,
surrounded
by
stores
of
major
chains,
and
other
concerns
was
i
asked,
well
can
you
compete
effectively
with
this
larger
chains
on
the
discount
houses?
and
he
said,
“the
question
is
not
whether
i
can
compete
with
them,
but
whether
they
can
compete
with
me.”
i
think
the
record
fully
bears
this
out,
because
of
their
buying
expenditures,
which
put
them
on
terms
of
equality
with
a
large
direct-buying
chains,
a
single-store
operator
has
many
advantages
which
a
chain
does
not
and
the
industry
witnesses
list
these.
it
includes
personal
on
the
scene
management,
something
which
most
of
them
say
is
much
more
effective
than
they
can
get
out
of
a
chain
store
manager.
it
includes
greater
flexibility.
they
can
make
a
change
in
prices
or
some
policy
in
a
matter
of
minutes,
whereas
the
chain
store
manager
has
to
go
through
channels.
they
have
an
opportunity
too
and
they
all
testified
to
this
fact,
take
a
more
active
role
in
the
community
affairs,
and
let's
get
well-known
and
develop
a
loyal
patronage.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
yes.
and
that
surprised
me
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
concession
in
the
government's
brief,
not
a
single
store,
i
don't
think
that
would
amount
to
a
substantial
lessening
in
an
area
marked
by
thousands
of
competitors.
but
it
did
surprise
me
that
the
government
would
suggest
in
its
brief
that
if
von's
have
gone
out
and
purchased
the
stores
of
36,
single-store
operators,
that
would
be
less
objectionable
than
the
acquisition
of
shopping
bag.
i
don't
think
the
record
would
bear
that
out.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
i
would
not
take
issue
with
that,
no,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
i'm
sure
at
some
point
--
point
in
time
mr.
justice
white
that
undoubtedly
would
result.
now,
whether
it
would
result
in
the
grocery
business,
i
don't
know.
casing
that
further
--
mr.
william
w.
alsup
well,
generally
--
mr.
william
w.
alsup
in
general
i
would
agree
of
what
you
have
just
a
few
large
competitors
where
they
might
be
concerned
about
their
own
act
in
retaliation
by
the
competitors.
there
might
be
a
tendency
not
to
engage
in
vigorous
price
competition,
i
wouldn't
quarrel
with
that.
i
doubt
very
much
if
that
whatever
occur
in
the
grocery
business.
as
so
many
economists
and
students
of
the
retail
grocery
business
have
pointed
out
it'll
mean
--
as
a
&
p
case,
both
published
in
1959
and
others
have
indicated
that
if
the
grocery
business
ever
got
to
the
point
where
large
concerns
decided
that
they
wouldn't
engage
in
vigorous
price
competitions,
they
were
very
quickly
seized
being
major
concerns.
ease
of
entry
is
one
thing
which
certainly
characterizes
this
market
and
if
the
chains
contrary
to
counsel
suggesting
ever
decided
that
the
game
of
price
competition
was
not
worth
the
candle,
i
have
no
doubt
they
would
very
soon
cease
being
the
leading
chains
because
we
have
just
too
many
small
vigorous,
aggressive
competitors
who
can
compete
on
terms
of
equality
with
the
stores
and
the
major
chains,
or
the
chains
ever
to
dare
get
so
complacent
--
mr.
william
w.
alsup
it
does
not
have
but
it
certainly
as
applied
to
the
los
angeles
market
mr.
justice
white.
i
know
that
market
well
and
i
think
what
distinguishes
this
market
above
all
other
markets,
perhaps
or
at
least
many
of
that
markets
because
i'm
sure
there's
strong
cooperative
elsewhere
is
the
ability
of
the
single-store
operator
to
get
his
groceries
on
his
shelf,
just
as
cheaply
as
the
large
direct-buying
chain.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
--
that
it
is
now
in
this
market
area
mr.
justice
brennan,
they
go
up
as
far
as
bakersville,
i
think
they
even
have
a
few
members
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
w.
alsup
the
great
bulk
according
to
officers.
now
--
mr.
william
w.
alsup
no,
it
would
--
i'm
sure
but
at
least
2500
but
that
would
be
a
speculation.
i
do
not
give
the
names
and
addresses
of
their
members.
but
i
think
it's
important
and
the
district
judge
attached
great
importance
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
campbell
stewart,
the
former
president
of
certified
and
at
that
time
a
consultant
to
certified.
and
also,
i
might
add
the
testimony
of
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
certified,
the
great
bulk
of
the
certified
grocers
business
is
made
up
of
the
smaller
competitors.
if
the
smaller
competitors
are
hurt,
certified
is
hurt.
if
the
major
chains
could
dominate
the
market,
certified
would
be
most
certainly
hurt
and
yet
mr.
stuart
testified,
he
saw
nothing
anticompetitive
in
this
merger,
nothing
that
would
prejudice
with
competitive
opportunities
of
the
smaller
grocers.
now
the
growth
as
i
said
of
certified
has
really
been
phenomenal.
it
is
now
the
largest
retailer-owned
cooperative
buying
organization
in
the
world.
membership
is
open
to
anyone.
that's
the
result
as
i
said
this
single-store
operator
can
compete
on
equal
terms.
in
1958
--
1948,
i'm
sorry,
certified's
wholesale
sales
to
its
members
were
only
$87
million.
in
1962,
they
amounted
to
$345
million.
the
growth
of
orange
empire,
another
major
cooperative
in
the
area,
has
also
been
spectacular.
it
has
a
thousand
members
and
here
again
mr.
justice
brennan,
not
all
can
find
los
angeles
and
orange
county.
in
1945,
its
wholesale
sales
to
its
members
were
less
than
$13
million,
and
in
1962,
there
were
$321
million.
and
the
various
witnesses
testified
that
the
services
of
orange
empire
to
their
members
is
every
depth
the
same
in
quality
as
a
service
that
certified
give
this
--
gives
its
members.
the
nature
of
certified
in
the
many
and
varied
services,
which
it
provides
for
its
members
in
addition
to
getting
them
their
groceries
and
on
prices
comparable
to
those
of
the
chains,
is
described
in
its
annual
report
from
1962
which
we
have
placed
in
the
record,
it's
exhibit
au.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
considerable
management
assistance
mr.
justice
brennan,
advertising
layout,
they
have
the
very
modern
electronic
data
processing
system.
they
keep
their
member's
advised
as
to
possible
shortages,
a
game
for
them
--
advertising
allowances
by
suppliers,
a
whole
range
of
services
in
addition
to
getting
them
their
groceries
at
proper
price.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
we
do
not
have
that
figure
mr.
justice
white,
but
it
must
be
very,
very
substantial.
i
have
seen
figures
which
indicated
that
next
to
a
&
p
and
safeway,
nationwide
certified
grocers,
wholesale
purchasers
are
greater
than
any
other
organization,
retailer
fine
organization.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
yes
but
that
--
we
could
make
a
rough
approximation
mr.
justice
brennan
but
--
mr.
william
w.
alsup
i'd
say
the
great
bulk
of
the
smaller
operators
with
the
possible
exception
of
small
mom
and
pop
stores
that
--
the
figure
is
complicated
somewhat
mr.
justice
brennan
because
some
of
the
leading
chains
are
still
members
of
certified.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
finding
is
that
the
great
bulk
of
today's
leading
regional
chains
got
their
start
in
this
area
with
nothing
but
one
store
and
a
membership
in
the
certified
grocers.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
membership
is
open
to
anyone.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
it
is
open
to
anyone.
i
should
add,
whoever
applies
must
make
this
two-week
grocery
deposit
in
advanced
and
an
interest
is
paid
on
that
deposit,
but
certified's
annual
report
indicates
very
substantial
returns
in
a
way
of
rebates
and
earnings
that
are
paid
back
to
the
members
each
year.
now,
counsel
and
we
in
our
briefs
have
had
some
argument
or
whether
the
market
is
a
hoped
lose
oligopoly
is
a
state
or
atomistic
as
we
state,
i
don't
think
it's
an
important
matter.
we
think
under
the
case
and
in
turn
the
definition
were
correct
for
this
atomistic,
but
i'm
certain
that
this
court
is
not
going
to
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
labels
such
as
that.
mr.
william
w.
alsup
well,
i
know
justice
cardozo,
i
have
frequently
read
his
opinions
criticizing
the
tyranny
of
labels
that
--
