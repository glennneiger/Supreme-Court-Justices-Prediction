mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
we're
here
on
behalf
of
the
appellees,
and
we're
asking
that
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
be
affirmed.
we
feel
that
this
case
is
a
meritless
case.
nevertheless,
notwithstanding,
we
attach
great
importance
to
the
effective
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
most
specially
section
7.
we
do
not
want
to
see
these
laws
dismantled,
word
by
word
or
page
by
page.
this
is
the
first
instance
of
our
disagreement
with
the
government
and
we
have
in
our
previous
case,
tendered
as
a
friend
of
this
court
on
behalf
of
the
government
and
with
i
hope
what's
pardonable
in
modesty,
we
say
we
come
here
with
clean
hands
and
warm
heart
for
antitrust.
our
disagreement
has
to
do
with
means,
not
ends.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
means.
means
of
accomplishing
--
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
the
protection
of
the
competitive
system.
we
are
in
agreement
with
their
mean
--
with
the
end
but
in
disagreement
with
the
means
by
which
they
are
carrying
the
statute
out
in
this
particular
proceeding.
we
represent
your
honors
the
independent
grocers
and
the
independent
supermarket
operators.
roughly
that
is
--
those
stores
between
one
and
ten
units.
they
are
all
local
operators,
your
honor.
they
all
operate
in
one
market.
now,
they
can
be
significant.
they
can
be
in
fact
large,
in
terms
of
the
government's
standard
here,
which
has
to
do
with
percentage
of
total
sales
in
a
market
and
depending
on
the
market,
depending
on
how
large
it
is
or
how
small
it
is,
a
single-store
operator
or
multi-unit
store
operator,
an
independent
supermarket
operator,
can
be
substantial
in
a
market.
and
they
are,
because
we
have
before
us
in
this
case,
where
the
acquiring
firm
had
only
4.7%
of
that
market,
and
the
acquired
firm
had
only
4.2%.
now,
the
merged
firms,
the
new
firm
had
7.5%.
now
there
aren't
many
independent
operators
in
smaller
markets.
they
can
have
7.5%
of
the
market
and
therefore,
this
brings
us
to
the
point.
i
have
only
a
short
time
remaining
and
i
would
like
to
come
to
the
key
issues
to
what
we
think
this
case
involves
and
your
honors,
the
key
issue
here
is
the
standard
is
wrong.
the
standard,
the
premise
for
which
the
government
raise
this
case
and
by
which
it
pursues
it,
is
wrong
and
as
a
result
the
conclusion
is
wrong.
now
we
say
it's
wrong
and
i'd
like
to
offer
this
conclusion
so
you
can
judge
the
merits
of
our
argument
as
we
move
along
because
i
think
it's
most
important
that
you
question
everything
we
have
to
offer.
we
are
saying
it's
wrong
because
it
disagrees
with
the
policy
of
the
statute.
we're
saying
it's
wrong
because
it
will
not
protect
the
competition,
prevent
oligopoly
and
prevent
monopoly
par
but
it
will
actually
be
create
it.
we
are
saying
this
is
wrong
because
it
will
injure
the
growth
and
the
development
of
local
independent
supermarket
operators
in
competing
against
larger
firms.
we
are
saying
it
wrong
because
it
injures
local
control,
which
we
have
in
this
market,
in
many
markets.
we
are
saying
it's
wrong
because
it
may
require
the
disapproval
of
future
mergers
by
independents
having
similar
market
shares.
we
are
saying
it's
wrong
because
it
closes
the
merger
route,
because
it
closes
the
horizontal
and
many,
many
of
the
independent
operators
have
very
little
interest
and
very
little
capability
to
engage
in
a
conglomerate,
a
market
extension
mergers
or
in
a
vertical.
they're
not
only
interested
in
staying
within
their
product
market
and
within
their
geographic
market.
so
by
applying
this
very
harsh
standard,
it
closes
the
merger
route
to
them.
they
have
no
alternative.
this
forces
them
to
rely
on
internal
expansion
and
we
point
it
out
in
our
brief
your
honors
that
if
there
are
many
disadvantages
to
forcing
small
local
operators,
small
in
terms
of
what
you
and
i
would
consider
it,
but
large
in
terms
of
the
government's
standard.
and
we
say
that
the
policy
here,
the
standard
of
the
government
is
wrong
because
it
is
applying
a
standard
in
a
way
that
will
actually
encourage
malignant
competitive
effects.
now,
why
do
we
say
these
--
the
standard
is
wrong?
because,
we
say
that
market
shares
in
terms
of
absolute
amount,
in
terms
of
percentage
what
a
particular
operator
has
in
terms
of
sales
is
compared
with
his
total
market,
is
not
a
good
tool
in
every
case.
market
share
is
a
tool,
and
in
some
cases,
a
very
valuable
tool,
but
it's
not
the
only
tool
by
which
the
section
7
case
can
be
judged,
and
we
submit
your
honors
that
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
because
we're
dealing
here
with
distribution.
we're
dealing
here
with
an
industry
composed
of
over
200,000
nationally,
over
200,000
food
stores.
so
it's
not
always
so
that
every
horizontal
merger
can
be
judged
in
terms
of
section
7
on
the
basis
of
market
shares.
and
we're
attempting
to
show
that
if
this
is
done,
it's
going
to
undo
the
purpose
that
congress
had
in
passing
this
law.
now,
we
feel
that
if
the
tool
of
market
share
is
used
and
certainly
in
establishing
a
prima
facie
case
that
it
necessary
to
show
some
reasonable
relationship
between
the
market
shares
and
the
competitive
advantage,
market
power,
ability
to
exclude
competitors
in
the
market,
these
are
the
indica
we're
after,
not
just
market
shares
and
we
feel
there
has
to
be
some
relationship
between
market
shares
and
what
we're
trying
to
prevent.
it's
this,
not
market
shares
increase
we're
trying
to
prevent,
its
injuries,
probable
injuries
to
competition.
now,
the
trouble
with
the
market
share
theory
your
honors,
is
that
it
provides
the
strictest
rule
for
horizontals
because
obviously
with
market
shares,
you
can't
deal
with
the
verticals
if
you
were
the
conglomerate,
now
what's
wrong
with
that?
because
small
business,
independent
operators,
will
engage
in
horizontals
almost
exclusively
where
the
larger
operators
with
larger
capital,
better
management
can
go
into
different
market,
different
product
markets
and
geographic
markets.
so
we
say
that
in
some
cases,
it
depends
on
the
market
facts,
and
on
the
environment.
in
some
cases,
you
need
a
more
extensive
market
analysis,
than
just
market
share
and
the
trouble
with
this
case
is
the
standard
is
wrong.
now,
we
understand,
the
government
seeks
a
simplified
test
and
we
share
that
view.
there
should
be
some
effort
made
to
simplify
this
section
7
cases
with
the
record
you
have
before
you,
but
we're
not
objecting
your
honors,
to
shortcuts.
we're
objecting
to
wrong
cuts
and
there's
no
basis
for
saying
that
simplified
test
necessarily
requires
market
shares.
we
would
like
to
see
in
our
briefs,
our
argument
here
is
positive
as
well
as
negative
because
we
believe
in
the
law.
we
would
like
to
see
a
broader
measure
in
this
case
of
testing
the
probability
of
injury
to
competition.
i'd
like
to
offer
five
major
points,
which
we
think
are
better
than
this
market
shares
test.
one,
is
there
any
decisive,
competitive
advantage
shown
or
any
probable
decisive
competitive
that
is
shown
for
the
merged
company,
anything
in
that
nature?
two,
what
is
the
effect
of
the
merger
on
opportunities
for
entry?
new
firms
company.
three,
what
is
the
success
of
small
firms
in
this
market?
number
three
--
number
four,
how
about
the
insecurity
of
leaders,
the
leaders
in
the
market?
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
the
insecurity
of
leaders,
are
the
leaders
always
at
the
top,
is
number
one
at
the
top,
number
two,
always
remains
two,
number
three
and
so
on.
and
we've
seen
here
from
the
evidence
here
in
connection
with
safeway
which
dropped
from
14%
to
8%,
that
there
is
a
great
insecurity
of
leaders
and
there's
a
fluidity
in
this
market,
a
mobility
in
this
market.
just
because
you're
number
one
in
terms
of
sales
doesn't
mean
you're
going
to
stay
there.
you
might
find
yourself
slipping.
so
we'd
like
to
offer
even
potential
competition,
a
new
forms,
we've
got
the
small
convenience
stores
your
honor,
small
convenience
stores
coming
into
the
market,
we've
got
the
discount
houses
and
so
on.
so,
those
are
five
major
--
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
your
honor.
no,
i
don't.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
i
--
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
there
is
much
--
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
well
your
honor,
some
of
it
--
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
no
your
honor.
i
think
we
should
have
flexibility.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
no,
i
--
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
i
understand,
we
should
have
flexibility,
because
it
depends
on
the
market
facts
involved,
it
depends
on
the
environment
involved.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
safeway.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
well,
because
in
that
situation,
i
think
we
could
go
down
the
list
of
the
indica
that
you
might
want
to
consider
in
connection
with
it,
what
the
competitive
advantage
might
be
over
other
operators
in
the
markets
where
they
operate,
what
it
would
do
to
new
entries,
what
it
would
do
to
small
firms
and
that
--
i
wouldn't
deal
in
terms
of
just
market
shares,
i
don't
say
they're
not
relevant
but
i
say
they're
not
all
important.
they
don't
decide
everything.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
exactly
your
honor.
exactly,
the
lower
down
you
get,
the
more
careful
you've
got
to
be.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
your
honor,
in
some
respects,
we
have
a
contracting
markets
because
of
the
supermarket
revolution.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
well,
the
--
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
i
think
the
result
of
that
is
that
the
number
of
retailers
declining.
i
think
between
1948
and
1958,
we
had
a
hundred
thousand
very
small
stores
--
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
i
think
the
trend
has
been
that
your
honor
but
i
don't
--
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
no,
i
think
we
can
show
that
there's
a
reversal
now
or
you're
having
more
people
coming,
with
different
types
of
operations.
so
i
think
these
things
have
a
way
--
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
yes.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
number
five
has
to
do
with
new
forms
of
competition.
mr.
henry
j.
bison,
jr.
such
as
forms
of
condition
that
have
existed
before
like
disco
houses
that
had
food
departments
and
tandem
stores,
you
know
the
convenient
stores.
there
have
been
many
kinds,
you
have
significance,
i
want
to
mention
some
minor
--
consider
a
product
differentiation.
opportunities
to
make
independent
decisions,
opportunities
to
use
advanced
technologies,
these
are
all
i
think
factors
that
have
a
lot
to
do
with
this.
now,
i
just
want
to
say
one
point
before
my
time
runs
out.
the
government
in
it's
brief
on
page
44
said
we
just
carefully
needed
that
small
firms
are
not
going
to
be
prevented
from
merger.
well
this
is
hardly
adequate
your
honor
because
in
their
term,
in
their
standard,
although
we
think
we're
small,
we're
very
large
when
they
come
to
this
market
share
test.
we
become
very
large
and
certainly,
we're
larger
and
with
some
cases
in
the
appellees
here.
now,
we
think
the
government
means
what
it
says
it
means.
and
we
don't
think
there's
going
to
be
any
discrepancy
between
this
action
and
the
theory.
we
can't
assume
otherwise.
and
we
feel
that
the
government
means
all
that
its
theory,
all
its
standards
implies.
and
we're
very
much
afraid
that
they
will
come
when
we
will
be
called
to
the
carpet
as
it
were
for
a
very
small
merger
where
we
think
it's
small
of
what
--
under
their
standard,
they've
been
too
large.
now,
just
summing
up,
we
trust
this
not
inappropriate
perhaps
let's
--
it's
not
inconceivable
that
this
court
will
feel
constrained
at
some
day
some
time,
to
contain
the
expansion
of
this
market
share
standards
and
to
limit
its
application,
we
submit
your
honors
this
is
the
time
and
this
is
the
case.
thank
you.
