justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
combination
put
the
combination
first?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
i
understand
you
say
anyway
mr.
posner
that
the
trend
toward
concentration
in
terms
of
increased
percentage
of
the
market,
without
regard
to
where
these
changes
individually
fit,
you
did
have
statistics
of
this
report.
that
in
other
words,
the
first
eight,
or
the
first
ten,
of
the
--
you've
been
telling
us
eight
had
this
percentage
ten,
the
first
20
had
that
and
so
forth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
my
question
is
where
--
how
up-to-date
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
point
is
that's
not
so
significant
where
the
respective
firm
stand
in
the
first
eight
or
ten.
as
it
is,
that
there's
an
increased
concentration
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
sense
of
proportion
of
the
market
with
those
first
eight
or
ten
shares,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
was
the
standard
you
suggest
mr.
posner?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
you
mentioned
40%
earlier
as
something
on
the
economist
field.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
it's
potentially
or
is
in
fact
oligopolistic
with
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
are
you
suggesting
that
we'd
take
some
mathematical
determination
of
that
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
confess
i
am
still
not
quite
clear
as
to
what
standard
is
you
think
ought
to
be
applied.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
interrupt
this
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
danger,
what
do
you
mean?
substantially
--
how?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
part
of
the
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
that's
in
volume
what,
6?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
albertsons
the
largest
national
chain?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
volume
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
tell
me
mr.
alsup,
is
that
combination
of
sparkle
and
certified
--
that
total
figure,
is
that
all
this
market
area
with
1000
counties,
about
3757
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
say
most
of
them,
what's
that
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
3700
total,
if
you
don't
know
what
that
means,
2500
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
management
services
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
do
know
don't
we
--
the
percentage
of
the
two
and
a
half
billion
n
the
small
retailers
among
them
have.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
why
i
was
asking
earlier.
how
far
--
how
many
of
them
certified
and
sparkle
represented?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
supposed
membership
is
not
open
to
anybody.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
open?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
we
did
not
even
do
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
market
certainly
is
not
oligopolistic
and
it
certainly
doesn't
act
like
one.
before
and
after
the
merger,
vigorous
price
competition
has
characterized
this
market.
the
findings
are
clear
on
that.
in
government
exhibit
24,
which
is
unprinted,
shows
the
advertisements
of
competitors
of
von's
and
shows
a
numerous
advertisements
on
many
and
varying
products
all
the
time.
counsel
suggests
that
major
chains
were
on
their
way
to
the
so-called
interdependent
price
competition
but
certainly
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
government
exhibit
24
under
--
unprinted,
you
will
see
it
cannot
possibly
do
the
case.
they
rely
upon
a
statement
of
mr.
hayden
of
the
deposition,
the
former
president
of
shopping
bag,
that
we
can't
get
more
from
our
--
for
our
product
and
the
other
fellow,
but
obviously,
mr.
hayden
was
referring
to
shelf
and
not
advertise
prices
and
the
advertised
prices
as
you
will
see
from
that
government
exhibit
24
range
all
over
the
lot.
and
the
trial
court,
at
least
that
testimony
from
the
president
of
von's,
a
mr.
ted
von
der
ahe,
that
there
isn't
much
further
that
the
chains
or
anyone
else
can
go
on
price
reduction
without
going
on
a
severe
austerity
program.
and
government
counsel
inquired
of
mr.
von
der
ahe
at
the
trial,
this
is
from
record
1344,
“based
on
your
experience
are
rival
chains
trying
to
cut
prices
today?”
answer,
“certainly,
they
are.”
mr.
coyle,
no
more
questions
your
honor.”
now
government
witness
palmer,
industry
witness
palmer,
i
might
add
in
1946
at
the
age
of
26,
from
the
total
assets
of
$16,000
entered
the
grocery
business
by
purchasing
a
half
interest
in
a
small
grocery
store
in
hollywood
and
now
is
the
president
of
a
four-store
chain
doing
an
annual
gross
business
of
$6
million
a
year.
he
did
complain
about
von's
price
reduction
in
1961.
his
complaint
was
still
going
on
in
1963,
when
von's
“slashed
prices
permanently
on
1000
items”.
he
testified
that
von's
was
a
better
--
or
shopping
bag
was
a
better
competitor
than
von's
because
its
prices
were
somewhat
higher.
that
this
witness
nevertheless
also
testified
that
he
could
meet
the
von's
reduced
prices
and
did
so
meet
them,
without
suffering
a
loss
in
their
profits.
he
just
cut
his
overhead
and
he
also
testified
that
that
enabled
the
grocery
stores
in
this
area
to
become
more
competitive
with
the
discount
houses
which
as
the
record
shows
and
our
brief
points
out
is
a
very
new,
very
vital
competitive
force
in
this
area.
i
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
it's
not
supported
by
the
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
reason
then
it
affirms
the
finding
that
there
has
been
increasing
concentration
except
as
we
take
the
statistics
you
have
supplied
and
we
read
them
themselves
as
requiring
a
conclusion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
say
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
do
i
correctly
understand
the
government's
position
mr.
posner
depends
for
its
basic
premise
on
this
tendency
to
--
towards
concentration
on
this
market?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
that's
the
basic
premises,
isn't
it?
now,
if
we
can
agree
that
this
record
supports
a
finding
to
that
effect
and
i
gather
--
the
government's
