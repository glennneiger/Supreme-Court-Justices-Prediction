mr.
richard
a.
posner
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
this
case
was
brought
by
the
government
in
1960,
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
and
it
involves
a
challenge
to
a
merger
that
year
of
two
major
grocery
chains
in
los
angeles,
von's
grocery
company
and
shopping
bag
food
stores.
after
a
preliminary
relief
was
denied
and
after
extensive
discovery
proceedings
were
conducted,
the
matter
came
on
for
trial
before
judge
carr
in
the
southern
district
of
california.
the
parties
agree
that
the
relevant
product
market
in
this
case,
the
line
of
commerce,
was
the
sale
of
groceries
and
related
products
by
grocery
stores
and
supermarkets
and
that
the
relevant
geographical
market,
the
section
of
the
country,
was
the
los
angeles
metropolitan
area,
consisting
of
los
angeles
and
orange
county's.
so
the
sole
contested
issue
was
whether
the
effect
of
the
merger
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition
or
to
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
in
the
relevant
market
and
on
this
the
judge
after
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
and
having
heard
the
evidence
of
both
parties,
held
that
the
government
had
not
proved
that
the
merger
might
have
this
effect
and
he
therefore
ordered
the
complaint
dismissed.
we
are
here
on
direct
appeal
under
the
expediting
act
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
on
primary
line
competition?
i
don't
understand.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
oh,
on
supplier's
product
to
grocery
stores,
no.
none,
just
on
the
--
the
only
competitive
effects
have
to
do
with
competition
in
the
retail
sale
of
grocery
products.
this
is
an
important
case
in
the
administration
of
the
merger
statute
for
two
reasons.
first,
this
court's
decision
will
provide
guidance
to
the
enforcement
of
this
law
in
the
nation's
largest
industry
and
the
industry
which
has
the
most
direct
and
immediate
concern
to
every
american
family.
and
second,
that
we
think
that
this
case
perhaps
more
than
any
previous
case
before
this
court,
with
possible
exception
of
the
brown
shoe
case,
tests
whether
section
7
is
in
fact,
as
its
framers
intended
it
to
be
an
effective
preventive
remedy
against
anticompetitive
practices
and
effects
and
before
i
begin
my
argument,
let
me
offer
a
brief
summary
of
the
government's
legal
theory.
we
rest
our
case
on
four
propositions.
first,
that
section
7's
basic
concern
is
with
preventing
the
emergence
of
highly
concentrated
or
oligopolistic
markets,
the
kind
of
markets
which
breed
anticompetitive
business
behavior.
second,
we
think
that
in
light
of
this
prophylactic
statutory
purpose,
a
merger
that
occurs
in
a
market
which
is
still
competitive
in
its
behavior
but
which
appears
to
be
turning
the
corner
into
a
situation
of
oligopoly
it
seems
to
be
crystallizing
as
an
oligopolistic
market
that
deserves
very
close
scrutiny
under
the
statute.
and
i'll
explain
that
this
was
precisely
the
situation
in
los
angeles
on
the
eve
of
the
merger
where
in
this
large
market
of
4000
competing
concerns,
eight
had
among
them
almost
two-fifths
of
total
sales
and
this
is
the
level
which
students
of
industrial
organization
had
deemed
oligopolistic.
and
furthermore,
and
very
relevant
here,
this
market
share
of
the
major
firms
had
been
increasing
steadily
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
before
the
merger
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
this
trend
towards
ever
increasing
concentration
has
continued
steadily
and
uninterruptedly
since
the
merger.
now
third,
where
in
such
a
--
such
an
industrial
setting
a
merger
unites
two
leading
sellers
in
the
market,
two
of
the
handful
major
firms
which
have
emerged
with
significant
market
shares
and
in
doing
so,
the
merger
has
contributed
substantially
to
the
concentration
movement.
we
think
the
statute
requires
that
it'd
be
forbidden
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
contrary
showing
--
a
clear
rebuttal
to
the
government's
case.
and
i'll
explain
when
i
get
to
that
point,
the
kinds
of
evidence
that
we
think
is
admissible
and
relevant
in
rebutting
the
government's
case.
i'll
explain
that
the
merger
of
von's
and
shopping
bag
which
united
the
third
and
sixth
largest
firms
in
this
major
local
market,
was
the
kind
of
merger
which
eliminates
a
--
one
of
the
few
market
leaders
and
thereby
substantially
increases
its
concentration.
that's
the
kind
of
merger
that
should
be
forbidden
unless
the
defendants
can
come
back
with
some
--
with
a
strong
showing
that
the
merger
--
that
the
merger
is
in
fact
unlikely
to
have
adverse
effects.
and
then
finally,
i'll
try
to
show
that
appellees
have
not
sustained
their
burden
of
rebuttal
of
the
government's
case.
let
me
begin
then
by
describing
the
relevant
market,
its
history
and
structure
and
behavior
on
the
eve
of
the
merger.
now,
the
los
angeles
metropolitan
areas,
los
angeles
and
orange
county's,
constitute
a
vast
retail
grocery
market
where
the
total
sales
of
grocery
stores
and
supermarkets
run
about
two
and
a
half
billion
dollars
a
year,
which
incidentally
is
as
much
as
for
example,
the
entire
retail
shoe
industry
in
the
united
states.
this
is
just
one
local
market,
a
local
market
which
really
dwarfs
some
whole
industries
that
had
been
involved
in
previous
section
7
proceedings.
now
in
a
retail
market
of
this
size,
one
expects
to
and
does
find
a
large
variety
in
number
of
competing
grocery
concerns
and
the
district
court
found
that
there
were
4000
separate
companies
at
the
time
of
the
merger
and
these
are
--
covered
a
considerable
range
in
type
of
operation.
at
the
top
you
had
the
large
supermarkets,
for
example,
safeway
--
large
supermarket
chains
like
safeway
which
is
a
large
national
chain,
which
has
in
los
angeles
many
supermarkets
throughout
the
area,
each
one
of
them
might
do
a
substantial
buy-in
like
perhaps
$5
million
a
year.
these
chains
had
dun
and
bradstreet's
top
financial
rating
which
enabled
them
to
at
least
base
in
shopping
centers.
they
had
their
own
warehousing
and
trucking
facilities
so
they
could
buy
direct
without
going
through
middleman
and
these
large
chains
which
as
i'll
explain,
included
von's
and
shopping
bag,
were
able
to
advertise
in
the
citywide
media,
the
newspapers,
because
they
had
enough
stores
scattered
throughout
the
area.
now
at
the
other
end
of
the
scale,
one
has
hundreds
and
perhaps
thousands
of
very
small
stores,
delicatessens,
the
corner
grocery
which
in
los
angels
are
called
mom
and
pop
stores.
these
are
often
very
small
and
with
antiquated
facilities
and
appointments,
and
inadequate
parking
space,
but
between
these
extremes,
there's
very
large
and
a
very
small
firms.
the
evidence
shows
that
there
are
--
there
is
a
range,
small
chains
prosperous
independent
operators
and
the
record
also
shows
that
there
is
a
certain
mobility,
an
upward
and
downward
mobility
in
this
market
that
small
firms
can
wax
large.
they
can
acquire
stores
and
build
themselves
into
chains
and
then
very
often
or
sometimes
a
chain
may
over-expand
and
get
into
trouble
and
go
broke.
there
is
new
entries
in
this
market.
there
are
new
companies
or
enterprising
businessmen
who
come
in
and
then
there
are
very
many
who
leave.
the
record
clearly
shows
a
long
steady
decline
in
the
number
of
firms
operating
there.
now,
given
this
--
with
this
large
variety
and
mobility
of
competitors
in
this
market,
there's
unquestionably
a
certain
competitive
format.
now,
the
district
court
found
that
competition
among
the
grocery
stores
and
supermarkets,
the
los
angeles
metropolitan
area
is
vigorous
and
we
don't
dispute
that
finding
on
this
appeal.
now
at
--
that
the
appellees
seem
to
think
that
once
we
make
this
concession,
once
we
agree
that
there
was
competition
in
this
market
at
the
time
of
the
merger
and
for
the
few
years
thereafter
which
are
covered
in
this
record,
we're
out
of
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
their
brief
is
substantially
devoted
to
the
proposition
that
this
was
indeed
a
competitive
market.
and
we
think
this
really
is
the
beginning
rather
than
the
end
of
the
section
7
analysis
because
the
section
7
is
really
to
be
an
effective
preventive
against
the
lessened
competition
which
is
associated
with
highly
concentrated
industries.
you
can't
force
the
government
to
wait
in
intervening
in
a
merger
movement
until
the
market
has
ceased
to
be
competitive.
the
point
for
intervention
is
that
point
where
the
market
while
still
competitive
is
becoming
concentrated
where
there
are
signs
that
--
it
is
beginning
to
crystallized
in
a
wrong
sort
of
way
and
while
we
don't
dispute
the
proposition
that
it
may
be
very
difficult
in
many
cases
to
know
when
a
market
is
in
danger
where
its
competitive
structure
is
in
jeopardy,
we
think
this
is
a
very
clear
case
for
finding
that
the
market
was
in
this
state
at
the
time
of
the
merger
that
it
was
in
a
dangerous
transitional
phase
towards
undue
concentration.
and
hence
it
had
reached
a
point
in
development
where
mergers
have
to
be
very
carefully
scrutinized
to
make
sure
that
they
are
not
moving
the
market
towards
this
undesirable
state.
now
the
factors
on
which
we
rely
for
this
initial
proposition
here
that
this
market
was
in
danger,
if
you
will,
on
the
eve
of
the
merger
is
that
the
market
share
of
a
small
group
of
large
firms
have
been
increasing
steadily
for
the
period
of
time
covered
in
this
record
prior
to
the
merger.
for
example,
in
1948,
the
eight
largest
firms
had
had
34%
of
total
sales
in
development
market
and
by
1958,
that
figure
had
reached
41%.
the
share
of
the
16
largest
firms
had
increased
from
42
to
53%,
the
share
of
the
20
largest
from
44
to
57%.
now
perhaps
i
should
remark
parenthetically
at
this
point
why
throughout
this
proceeding,
the
government
in
presenting
market
share
statistics
has
focused
on
particular
years,
1948,
1954,
1958
and
1963.
the
reason
is
simply
that
these
were
years
in
which
the
census
bureau
conducted
a
business
census.
now,
market
share
statistics
obviously
can't
be
derived
and
are
not
reliable
unless
you
have
a
sum
total
against
which
you
compare
the
shares
of
an
individual
firm
or
group
of
firms.
you
have
to
have
what
statisticians
call
a
universe.
and
in
this
case
of
course,
the
appropriate
universe
for
computing
the
percentage
shares
of
these
major
firms
are
total
sales
of
the
grocery
stores
and
supermarkets
in
los
angeles.
and
since
there
are
4000
of
them
and
many
of
them
very
small,
and
since
the
sum
total
is
in
the
neighborhood
of
two
billion
or
more,
it's
very
difficult
to
gather
these
reliable
universe
figures.
now,
i
don't
think
anyone
disputes
the
fact
that
the
census
bureau
is
equipped
to
make
these
determinations,
but
once
you
leave
census
years
for
which
you
do
have
those
determinations,
you
embark
on
a
sea
of
uncertainties.
you
are
left
with
gross
estimates
and
projections
and
guesses
and
samples
of
various
sort
and
appellees
have
relied
on
some
years,
not
census
years,
to
show
various
market
shares
and
we
just
want
to
remind
the
court
of
the
fundamental
unreliability
of
market
share
statistics
which
don't
have
this
census
universe.
now,
having
said
that
let
me
hasten
to
add
that
appellees
own
figures
in
general
confirm
the
government's
census
data,
showing
this
increase
in
concentration
up
to
the
time
of
the
merger.
they
have
a
table
which
is
at
page
2788
of
the
record
which
shows
that
between
1950,
which
was
the
first
--
first
year
in
that
table
and
1958,
the
share
of
the
eight
largest
firms
in
this
market
increased
from
33
to
39%.
now,
their
table
shows
a
falling
off
of
some
extent
in
1959,
but
that
was
a
year
in
which
a
strike
closed
the
major
chains
in
los
angels
while
leaving
the
smaller
stores
open
for
a
month
and
this
caused
a
large
diversion
of
business
to
these
smaller
fellows
and
distort
the
year's
statistics
on
market
share.
so
however
you
look
at
it,
the
trend
towards
higher
and
higher
levels
of
concentration
is
clear
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
relied
--
in
our
reply
brief,
again
using
census
figures,
this
trend
continued
after
the
merger
until
1963,
which
is
the
last
census
year.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
it's
a
little
difficult
to
compute
precisely
because
the
census
bureau
had
split
the
los
angeles
metropolitan
area
into
los
angeles
county
and
orange
county.
but
the
figures
show,
for
example
in
los
angeles
county,
an
increase
from
approximately
25
to
--
give
it
to
you
precisely;
of
the
four
largest
firms
between
58
and
63
in
los
angeles,
their
share
arose
from
24.6%
to
30.3%
and
that
would
be
the
eight
largest
from
39
around
it
or
from
40
to
43,
and
that
of
the
20
largest
from
55
to
61.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
20,
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
excuse
me?
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
relevant
market
includes
the
two
counties.
the
census
figures
for
1963
split
them
to
show
them
independently.
now,
my
second
point
in
showing
that
this
was
a
market
which
at
the
time
of
the
merger
was
urging
an
oligopoly
was
becoming
dangerously
concentrated.
it
has
to
do
with
the
level
of
concentration
that
had
been
reached
at
this
time,
and
which
we
think
was
a
formidable
level
of
concentration
where
the
leading
firms
had
large
market
shares,
bearing
in
mind
that
we're
talking
about
a
market
of
some
$2-2.5
billion
dollars
in
sales
where
even
a
1%
share
is
$25
million
dollars
which
is
no
mean
total
for
a
firm
to
have.
and
furthermore,
in
appraising
these
market
share
figures,
we
ask
you
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
appellees
have
urged
throughout
this
proceeding
that
the
economies
of
scales,
economists
discussed
them
in
the
grocery
industry,
are
not
great.
if
you
can
be
an
efficient
grocery
company
without
having,
without
being
an
enormous
enterprise
with
a
great
many
chains,
a
small
chain
or
even
a
single
large
supermarket
operation
should
be
efficient
and
so
this
was
a
market
which
could
have
supported
a
great
many
small
firms
without
any
large
firms.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
that's
true
and
when
they
do
so,
they're
able
to
buy
some
of
their
products
at
any
event
at
the
same
price
of
the
chain,
but
we
don't
attach
anticompetitive
significance
to
belong
into
a
cooperative.
that's
--
that
is
not
a
form
of
conglomeration
or
aggregation
which
has
the
anticompetitive
implications
of
a
merger
because
each
member
of
the
cooperative,
sets
his
own
prices
and
is
an
independent
firm.
now
using
the
table
which
the
district
court
uses
in
its
opinion,
let
me
review
the
market
positions
of
the
major
chains
in
1958,
using
1958
figures
because
that
was
the
last
year
before
--
the
last
census
year
before
the
merger.
number
one
in
this
market
was
safeway,
a
large
national
chain.
it
had
a
$160
million
in
sales
in
1958,
and
this
gave
it
an
8%
market
share.
number
two
was
a
local
chain,
ralphs
with
a
6.4%
share.
von's
was
third,
with
4.7%.
shopping
bag
was
sixth
with
4.2%
and
that
was
based
on
sales
of
$85
million.
the
four
largest
firms
had
a
total
of
23.5%,
and
the
eight
largest,
39%,
the
ten
largest,
44%,
the
12
largest,
49.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
on
a
basis
of
this
1958
figures
von's
and
shopping
bag
had
an
8.9%
share,
it
was
larger
than
safeway's.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
don't
know
in
1963
because
the
census
doesn't
breakdown
sales
by
individual
firms.
we
know
the
four
largest,
we
--
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
the
actual
position
of
von's
that
year.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
know
the
trend
in
terms
of
the
group
of
four
firms
at
the
top.
we
don't
have
a
very
good
idea
of
the
personal
fortunes
of
von's
in
this
market.
there
is
--
the
district
court
made
an
estimate,
that
in
1960
--
that
is
when
the
merger
actually
took
place,
von's
market
share
was
7.5%
which
would
put
it
slightly
behind
safeway.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
it
is
a
finding
and
again
we
point
out
that
its
reliability
is
impossible
to
verify
because
the
universe
on
which
this
percentage
was
computed
was
based
on
guess
work
projection
rather
than
on
actual
data
gathered
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
don't
know
safeway's
history
since
1958.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
don't
know,
it's
share
over
a
longer
period
of
time,
going
back
to
1948
has
been
down.
as
we
--
we've
point
out
in
our
brief,
safeway,
many
years
ago,
had
this
los
angeles
area
blanketed
with
stores.
i
think
at
one
point
it
had
a
thousand
stores.
many
of
them
were
very
small.
i
think
this
is
an
experience
which
is
overtaken
a
lot
of
major
grocery
chains
in
this
country
like
a
&
p.
when
supermarkets
became
the
vogue
and
became
a
very
convenient
means
of
shopping,
some
of
these
older
chains
were
caught
napping
and
they
had
a
great
many
stores
which
were
no
longer
very
desirable.
and
they
would
then
make
efforts
to
consolidate
to
get
rid
of
stores
to
replace
them
with
supermarkets
and
safeway
has
gone
through
this
kind
of
transitional
stage
and
in
the
course
of
it
its
market
share
has
apparently
for
not
--
for
not
some
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
don't
know,
ralphs
would
have
been
third
on
the
basis
of
1958
figures.
i
think
it
was
still
third
according
to
the
appellees'
estimate
in
1960
where
is
today,
we
don't
--
this
record
doesn't
show.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
right,
the
1960
--
the
census
doesn't
break
down.
it
doesn't
identify
the
firms
which
were
up
top
4
or
top
8,
and
it
also
doesn't
release
individual
firm
figures.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
the
way
we
--
the
way
the
sales
were
obtained
was
that
the
government
agents
went
to
these
companies
and
asked
to
look
at
their
books
or
to
have
and
make
a
computation
of
sales
which
were
then
checked.
you
see,
there's
no
real
problem
in
getting
sales
for
particular
firms,
that's
not
a
problem.
the
problem
is
in
computing
a
percentage
in
market
share
by
comparing
the
sales
which
you've
gotten
from
the
firm
with
a
--
with
the
entire
market.
and
this
is
a
market
which
has
so
many
firms
that
it's
difficult
to
compute
this
in
reverse
and
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
you
could
tell
--
you
would
have
to
know
something
about
whether
the
overall
market
was
expanding
or
decreasing.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
but
the
record
doesn't
have
figures
for
the
individual
firms
in
1963.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
there
is
some
evidence,
i
believe
as
late
as
1963.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
evidence?
i
think
the
last
evidence
is
--
i'd
say
--
let
me
explain
this.
the
census
data
is
not
part
of
the
record
and
we
didn't
rely
on
it
as
being
in
the
record.
when
the
appellees
in
their
brief
cited
some
trade
articles
from
1955
and
1966
containing
evidence
for
alleging
that
competition
was
becoming
even
more
vigorous
in
this
market,
we
thought
it
would
be
helpful
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
some
evidence
tended
in
the
opposite
direction
which
being
census
data
is
--
of
unquestioned
reliability.
this
court
has
taken
judicial
notice
of
census
data
in
antitrust
cases,
but
we
don't
suggest
that
this
data
gives
a
firm
indication
of
where
of
the
particular
fortunes
of
these
individual
firms.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
there's
no
(voice
overlap)
--
there's
no
question
--
pardon?
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
goes
through
1963,
because
the
census
made
a
copy
to
a
special
tabulation
of
the
top
4,
8
--
i
suppose
down
to
20
firms
in
1963.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
well
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
absolutely,
there
maybe
some
shifting
around
in
the
rank
of
these
firms
probably
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
as
i
think
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
if
you
had
that
kind
of
mobility,
it
would
suggest
a
very
competitive
situation
but
no
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
the
leading
--
i
don't
think
the
record
contains
complete
information
on
this.
some
firms
have
built
their
way
up
to
the
top
20
over
the
period
covered
in
the
record
from
1948
to
1958.
i
know
of
no
disastrous
drops
in
firm
fortunes.
there
have
been
some
firms
in
the
top
20
which
have
gone
bankrupt
but
they
didn't
split
sundry
into
little
firms,
they
were
instead
acquired
by
large
chains
from
outside
of
the
market.
so
that
the
structure
of
concentration
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
would
not
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
there's
no
--
there's
certainly
no
contrary
indication
but
--
and
i'm
sure
that
it
would
be
in
this
record.
i'm
sure
appellees
would
have
presented
that
evidence
as
if
--
because
they
did
urge
--
they
did
emphasize
the
fact
that
there
had
been
some
departures
from
the
ranks
of
the
top
20.
so
i'd
say
that
the
record
does
support
the
conclusion
that
there
has
been
substantial
stability
among
the
leading
firms.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
roughly
the
same
firms,
yes.
now
in
reciting
these
market
share
figures
that
we
have
on
the
basis
of
1958
sales,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
this
market
had
reached
the
tightly
oligopolistic,
highly
concentrated
stage
of
--
say,
the
philadelphia
bank
case,
where
two
firms
had
44%
of
the
market,
but
there
was
--
there
were
--
i
might
say
the
storm
warnings
of
oligopoly
clearly
off
in
this
industry
because
when
you
have
a
market
in
which
eight
firms
have
more
than
a
third
and
almost
two-fifths
of
the
total
sales,
this
is
already
a
level
which
economists
and
students
of
industrial
organization
who
classify,
who
study
markets
over
long
range,
consider
oligopolistic,
consider
at
the
threshold
at
least
of
oligopoly.
so
let
me
move
from
the
background
of
the
merger
here
to
the
merger
itself.
the
parties
to
the
merger
von's
and
shopping
bag
were
two
of
the
leading
firms,
as
i've
already
mentioned
in
this
large
market
with
4.7
and
4.2%
of
total
sales.
they
had
all
the
attributes
of
the
major
chains
in
this
market.
they
had
their
own
warehouse
unit,
distribution
facilities,
they
at
--
they
were
two
of
the
handful
of
chains
who
advertised
in
the
major
media,
the
citywide
newspapers,
and
they
were
two
of
only
seven
chains
whose
prices
were
carried
in
a
book
that
was
widely
distributed
in
this
area
called
the
competitive
survey.
and
this
was
a
list
of
some
3000
shelf
items,
and
the
prices
charged
for
each
of
them
by
seven
chains,
the
theory
being
that
these
were
the
major
companies
in
the
market
and
these
were
the
people
whose
prices
you
ought
to
know
before
you
set
your
own.
combined
these
merging
firms
had
as
i
said,
based
on
1958
figures,
almost
9%
of
total
sales
larger
than
any
other
firm
and
this
was
based
on
the
total
combined
sales
of
a
$185
million.
now
despite,
if
these
figures,
the
--
or
despite
what
i've
said
about
these
merging
companies,
there
has
been
a
suggestion
in
this
case
that
this
was
really
just
a
merger
of
small
local
firms.
now
von's
as
a
result
of
this
acquisition,
became
a
publicly
held
corporation
whose
shares
are
now
traded
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
it's
not
in
indiciam
of
local
ownership.
it
is
moreover
approximately
the
nation's
16th
largest
grocery
chain
now,
and
bearing
in
mind
that
this
is
a
$50
billion
industry
and
moreover
and
very
significantly
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
von's
and
shopping
bag
before
the
merger
competed
effectively
with
safeway,
a
national
chain
with
total
sales
are
in
the
billions
and
which
was
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
the
largest
firm
in
this
market.
von's
as
a
result
of
this
acquisition
was
catapulted
head
focusing
on
this
local
market
of
the
major
national
chains
that
operate
there
like
a
&
p,
and
food
fair
and
acme
and
so
on.
so,
in
this
particular
pond,
this
very
large
local
market,
von's
became
a
very
large
frog.
and
we
think
that
so
far
as
the
policies
of
section
7
go,
they
are
concern
with
preserving
competition
in
submarkets,
not
just
in
considering
the
nation
as
a
whole,
the
size
of
this
firm
definitely
raises
the
gravest
antitrust
questions.
and
i
might
also
mention
in
discussing
the
circumstances
of
this
merger,
the
suggestion
that
shopping
bag
was
in
some
sense
in
trouble
and
that's
why
i've
made
the
--
quite
sold
that
to
von's.
now,
there's
no
contention
that
this
was
a
failing
company
or
that
it
was
anywhere
near
failure,
it
was
making
money,
but
nevertheless,
its
ownership
felt
that
shopping
bag's
management
was
thin
and
that
the
company
ought
to
be
making
more
money
and
its
ratio
of
profits
to
sales
and
profits
to
assets
was
lower
than
von's
for
example.
now
it's
clear
certainly
that
one
can't
justify
every
merger
merely
on
the
ground
that
the
acquired
firm
had
some
management
difficulties.
many
of
the
largest
corporations
in
this
country
certainly
have
had
periods
in
which
they
were
having
some
management
difficulties
and
they
weren't
making
quite
as
much
money
as
they'd
like
to
and
perhaps
even
were
sustaining
loses,
although
that
is
not
the
situation
here
and
there
are
many
ways
in
which
a
company's
management
can
be
renovated
and
improved
without
being
acquired
by
its
major
competitor.
and
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
the
only
way
out
for
shopping
bag,
the
only
avenue
of
relief
from
its
management
difficulties
which
had
somewhat
impaired
its
profitability,
was
to
be
acquired
by
von's.
now
finally
to
the
impact
of
this
merger;
it
eliminated
a
major
competitive
factor
in
this
market.
i've
already
mentioned
the
party
stipulation
that
shopping
bag
competed
effectively
with
safeway,
the
largest
chain
and
there's
no
doubt
that
shopping
bag
was
one
of
the
majors
in
this
market,
it
was
regarded
as
such
by
those
who
watch
the
market,
by
those
who
distributed
these
price
surveys.
so
we
are
not
concerned
here
with
the
merger,
either
between
small
firms
or
merger
which
takes
out
of
the
markets,
nothing
more
than
an
insignificant
run
of
the
mine,
marginal
operator.
this
merger
removed
as
an
independent
competitor,
one
and
perhaps
half
dozen
or
seven
or
eight
firms
which
had
emerged
as
the
market's
leaders
and
in
doing
so,
the
merger
had
a
dramatic
immediate
effect
on
the
structure
of
concentration
in
this
market.
the
von's
share
--
the
two
largest
firms,
based
as
throughout
on
the
1958
figures,
rose
from
14
to
17%,
and
that
of
the
three
largest
from
19
to
23%,
of
the
four
largest
from
24
to
28%,
and
of
the
eight
largest
from
39
to
42.
and
if
we
go
back
to
1948
to
trace
the
growth
and
concentration
in
this
market
over
a
long
period
of
time,
suggestion
of
professor
box,
preceded
the
share
of
the
eight
largest
rose
from
34%
in
1948
to
42%
after
the
merger
on
the
basis
of
the
1958
figures,
and
this
we
think
is
a
very
substantial
increase.
now
having
reviewed
the
government's
evidence
here
let
me
try
to
suggest
why
we
think
that
this
is
enough
proof
that
a
merger
may
have
the
prescribed
competitive
effects.
and
when
--
and
in
discussing
this
critical
issue,
i'll
try
to
--
at
the
same
time,
a
deal
with
appellees
suggestion
that
standards
which
the
government
is
proposing
here
really
constitute
a
rigid
and
sweeping
per
se
rule
which
would
stifle
business
growth
by
a
wholly
preventing
mergers.
i
said
earlier
that
i
thought
that
appellees
had
based
much
of
their
argument
and
this
is
certainly
a
theme
that
pervades
the
district
court's
opinion.
on
the
--
on
a
demonstration
which
was
quite
unnecessary,
a
view
of
our
concession
on
this
point,
that
this
was
indeed
a
vigorously
competitive
merger
--
excuse
me,
vigorously
competitive
market
both
for
the
merger
and
after
the
merger.
they
apparently
then
and
so
reasoning
confined
section
7
to
either
policing
industries
which
have
already
would
come
oligopolistic
or
prevent
perhaps
with
preventing
mergers
which
--
in
a
competitive
market
stifle
competition
so
that
whereas
the
day
before
the
merger,
there
was
lots
of
vigorous
competition
--
a
day
or
a
year
or
two
after
the
merger,
that
competition
has
been
stifled.
and
they
point
as
the
proper
applications
of
this
section
7,
the
previous
cases
in
this
court
which
are
by
and
large
involved
highly
oligopolistic
markets
in
continental
can,
in
rome
cable
and
in
the
bank
cases,
and
even
in
brown
shoe,
the
local
shoe
markets
wherein
a
number
of
cases
are
rather
concentrated
to
firms
who
might
have
40%
of
the
market.
in
these
cases
however,
the
most
vigorous
merger
enforcement
couldn't
prevent,
couldn't
head
off
oligopoly.
it's
much
too
late
for
that.
the
most
you
could
do
by
vigorous
enforcement
of
the
merger
law
was
to
keep
open
the
possibility
that
if
the
merger
rule
was
blocked
for
these
large
firms,
natural
economic
forces
might
eventually
push
the
market
towards
a
less
concentrated
state.
now
in
this
case,
we're
invoking
a
more
truly
perhaps
preventive,
and
maybe
even
a
more
constructive
application
of
section
7
and
it's
the
rule
that
we
think
congress
particularly
had
in
mind
because
congress
realized
this
theme
is
clear
in
the
legislative
history
that
many
markets
and
industries
in
this
country
had
become
highly
concentrated,
a
fate
which
congress
attributed
in
large
measure
to
the
inadequacy
of
existing
law
to
deal
with
mergers.
and
they
plainly
didn't
want
this
kind
of
thing
to
be
repeated
in
those
markets
and
industries
which
weren't
yet
concentrated.
this
means
that
the
law
is
particularly
concerned
with
what
happens
in
markets
which
were
still
competitive.
now
this
--
of
course,
it
doesn't
mean
that
all
mergers
are
all
horizontal
mergers
in
such
markets
are
bad,
are
forbidden
because
they
might
be
the
beginning
of
an
undesirable
trend.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
suggest
focusing
upon
markets
where
--
while
they're
still
competitive,
they've
began
to
turn
the
corner
to
oligopoly.
concentration
in
industries
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well
i
think
economist
would
feel
that
in
a
market's
that
concentrated
--
there's
a
chance
that
they'll
have
less
than
competition,
but
it's
by
no
means
certain
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
we
don't
suggest
that.
we
have
not
rested
our
case
entirely
on
the
showing
that
this
was
a
market
in
which
the
eight
largest
firms
had
40%.
we
suggest
it's
also
important
to
look
at
the
history
of
this
concentration
if
it's
been
increasing,
there's
reason
to
believe
that
the
40%
is
not
a
stable
level
but
then
it's
going
to
get
worse,
had
it
been
declined
from
a
higher
level,
there
might
be
less
reason
for
concern.
we
do
think
that
in
this
market,
and
without
trying
to
set
forth
any
precise
quantitative
test
that
it's
clear
in
this
market
that
it
was
entering
a
danger
zone.
now
even
in
such
a
market
to
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
we
think
the
court
has
to
make
two
determinations
in
a
case
of
this
sort.
the
first
is,
has
the
market
so
far
departed
from
the
atomistic
state,
the
fragmented
model?
that
you
can
fairly
say
that
there's
a
danger
in
concentration.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
it
can't
be
fixed
precisely.
no
--
you
have
a
spectrum
here,
on
the
one
hand,
obviously
you
have
markets
which
are
very
itemized
and
markets
which
are
highly
concentrated.
no
one
can
say
what
is
the
critical
dividing
point.
we
are
helped
in
this
case
by
the
fact
that
the
market
had
reached
a
point
of
the
kind
that
economists
have
regarded
as
a
fairly
reasonable
dividing
point
and
also,
by
the
fact
that
this
concentration
had
been
increasing
steadily
over
the
years.
and
we
also
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
that
the
behavior
of
these
firms
was
beginning
to
at
least
suggest
the
rudiments
of
oligopolistic
behavior
and
that
these
firms
had
picked
out
--
the
major
firms
had
picked
each
other
out
as
the
rivals
to
be
watched.
this
--
this
testimony
that
they
were
very
conscious
of
what
these
other
large
firms
which
are
--
and
felt
they
had
to
remain
competitive
with
them.
now,
if
the
first
part
of
this
standard
is
satisfied
and
if
it's
agreed
that
we
have
a
market
here
which
was
in
danger,
which
was
becoming
concentrated,
we
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
sure.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
a
danger
that
if
mergers
are
allowed
to
continue,
this
market
within
the
foreseeable
future
will
reach
a
state
so
clearly
concentrated
that
there's
no
substantial
hope
for
--
the
digger
of
competition.
now
even
in
such
a
market,
we
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
all
mergers
are
proscribed.
we're
not
concerned
here
with
a
merger
between
two
of
the
small
firms
in
this
market,
the
relatively
small
firms.
we're
primarily
interested
in
mergers
which
combine
two
of
the
majors
in
a
market
where
a
few
firms
have
clearly
emerged
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
this
court
has
assumed
and
has
said
many
times
that
in
a
situation
in
a
market
where
a
very
few
firms
have
very
large
market
shares,
the
prospects
are
for
that
well
as
the
rome
cable
case
said,
hollow
policies
have
mutual
advantage
rather
than
competition
will
emerge.
now
we
don't
for
a
moment
suggests
that
this
market
had
reached
that
point,
but
the
trend
in
the
market
was
such
that
if
there
isn't
vigorous,
governmental
intervention
in
the
merger
movement
in
that
market,
it's
going
to
reach
that
point
of
high
concentration.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
high
concentration
is
very
likely
though
admittedly
not
certain
to
result
in
a
diminished
vigor
of
competition.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
the
basic
theory
would
be
the
price
competition
is
much
less
likely.
if
you
have
firms
that
are
so
large
that
a
price
cut
by
one
is
going
to
eat
into
the
other
fellow's
market
share
so
substantially
that
he's
got
to
retaliate.
as
soon
as
firms
make
this
kind
of
calculation
as
to
their
major
rival's
response,
they're
not
likely
to
be
price
initiated.
now
it's
possible,
and
in
fact
it's
very
common
in
these
industries,
that
rivalry
is
channeled
into
other
non-priced
direction
such
as
very
heavy
advertising,
in
the
soap
industry
for
example.
but
this
kind
of
competition,
in
itself
may
have
bad
consequences.
it
may
make
a
very
difficult
for
small
firms
to
come
into
the
market.
they
can't
match
these
huge
advertising
expenditures.
this
is
the
end
of
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
let
me
take
up
that
point
then.
we
don't
suggest
today
that
entry
is
difficult,
but
we
do
think
that
this
factor
of
entry
doesn't
offset
the
adverse
effects
of
this
merger
and
in
two
–
the
entry
can
be
relevant
in
two
respects
in
evaluating
the
effects
of
the
merger.
first,
if
you
had
a
lot
of
entry,
it
may
be
that
no
firm
and
no
small
group
of
firms
can
obtain
a
large
market
share.
the
influx
of
new
competitors
keeps
eroding
their
share.
now
this
--
this
factor
is
fairly
not
relevant
here
because
the
history
of
this
market
for
many
years
shows
that
concentration
has
increased,
that
the
dominant
firms
have
obtained
ever
larger
shares
of
the
market.
the
reasons
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
it
is
--
i
don't
think
any
new
firm
has
reached
that
high
into
the
top
20
but
firms
have
grown
--
that
is
there
is
successful
entry,
but
it's
more
than
over
balanced
by
exit,
by
bankruptcy,
by
acquisitions
because
though
you
have
new
firms
coming
in,
you
have
many
more
firms
exiting
and
that's
why
year-after-year
the
number
of
firms
in
the
market
decreases
and
the
market
share
of
the
top
echelons
increase.
that's
one
element
of
entry.
the
other
is,
it
is
theorized
that
the
threat
of
new
entry
constitutes
a
restraining
influence
on
the
behavior
of
the
monopolist
or
an
oligopolist.
the
theory
goes
that
he's
afraid
to
raise
his
price,
say
the
monopolist,
he's
afraid
to
raise
his
price
too
high
because
that
will
make
it
very
attractive
for
other
firms
to
come
in
and
take
his
business
away
from
him.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
believe
we
don't
have
statistics
on
a
number
of
firms
that
have
come
in.
we
have
the
difference
between
the
number
who
come
in
and
the
number
who
leaves
which
is
the
net
decline
for
a
year.
it
is
clear
i
think
from
this
record,
that
many
of
the
firms
would
do
come
in,
do
so
on
a
marginal
basis.
it's
a
lot
easier
to
open
a
small
grocery
store
or
delicatessen
than
it
is
to
open
a
$2
million
a
year
supermarket.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
don't
know
whether
entry
has
been
declined
but
the
total
number
of
firms
has
been
declining
which
suggest
that
the
balance
of
exit
and
entry
very
much
favors
exit
of
lots
of
firms.
now
with
regard
to
this
possibility
that
when
the
day
comes,
if
it
does
come,
that
this
market
is
highly
oligopolistic.
it
is
conceivable
that
no
entry
might
exercise
some
kind
of
control
on
how
these
powerful
firms
exercise
their
power
and
they
may
be
somewhat
limited
by
theory
that
it
may
abuse
their
power
or
exploit
their
power,
it
will
be
--
it
will
invite
new
companies
to
come
in.
all
i
can
say
about
is
that
is
--
that
it
is
a
highly
speculative
possibility
which
presupposes
that
if
this
market
is
allowed
to
become
more
and
more
concentrated.
the
difficulty
eventually
will
remain
unchanged
and
i
think
that's
very
unlikely.
i
think
if
the
day
comes
that
two
or
three
chains
have
very
large
shares
of
this
market
have
hundreds
of
supermarkets
spread
throughout
the
area,
have
preempted
the
choice
locations,
or
have
blanketed
the
area
with
advertising,
it
seems
to
me
entry
by
new
firms
will
be
substantially
less
likely
and
less
and
the
prospects
would
be
less
inviting.
that's
why
we
don't
think
that
in
this
case,
appellees
have
successfully
rebutted
our
affirmative
case
by
their
references
to
entry.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
mr.
justice
black
asked
mr.
bison
whether
he
thought
a
merger
of
the
two
largest
chains
in
the
nation,
a
&
p
and
safeway,
would
be
illegal.
now
it
seems
to
me
clear
on
the
basis
of
the
test,
he
suggested
that
it
would
not
be
illegal.
he
named
five
factors
which
he
thought
offers
a
preferable,
more
flexible
test
to
the
government.
for
example,
the
fact
on
the
opportunities
of
small
firms.
well
if
a
&
p
and
safeway
merged
tomorrow,
i'm
sure
there
would
be
no
immediately
discernible
effect
on
small
firm.
he
talked
about
the
emergence
of
new
forms
of
competition
like
discount
houses,
just
we
point
out
in
our
brief
are
typically
leaves
two
large
chains.
well
these
new
forms
of
competition
if
that's
a
relevant
factor
here
are
prevalent
throughout
the
grocery
industry
and
would
be
a
basis
under
his
test
of
justifying
the
largest
conceivable
merger.
he
mentioned
the
effect
on
opportunities
of
new
entry.
and
again,
if
a
&
p
merged
today,
tomorrow,
there
won't
be
any
immediate
--
immediately
discernable
effect
on
new
entry.
and
i
think
same
is
true
with
his
point
about
decisive
competitive
advantage
if
a
&
p
and
safeway
merge
their
market
share
over
the
--
on
the
national
level,
i
don't
know
precisely
what
it
is,
it
would
certainly
be
less
than
10%
and
it
would
not
appear
decisive.
in
other
words,
the
test
that
mr.
bison
suggest
in
the
standards
which
mr.
alsup
has
discussed
are
focused
merely
on
the
immediate
effects
of
a
merger
on
its
immediate
situation,
how
competitive
is
the
market
when
the
merger
occurs
and
will
the
merger
of
itself
transform
this
situation,
affect
various
entry
or
give
the
resulting
firm
a
decisive
advantage.
and
we're
--
and
our
concern
and
the
law's
concern
is
with
it
--
is
with
the
long
range,
with
the
future.
nothing
that
appellees
have
said
offsets
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
steady
increase
in
concentration
in
this
market
which
has
reached
a
formidable
levels.
there's
not
--
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
trend
is
about
to
be
reversed
and
we
therefore
think
that
looking
to
the
future,
this
is
a
market
where
mergers
between
substantial
firms
in
that
market
pose
a
real
threat
and
mr.
bison
has
expressed
the
theory
of
the
government
standard
may
someday
be
invoked,
estoppled
by
this
court
to
prevent
single
operators
of
grocery
stores
from
merging.
on
the
theory
i
supposed
that
there
may
be
some
small
towns
in
which
a
firm
which
has
only
one
store
may
have
a
4%
market
share.
now,
we
don't
think
that
clayton
act
is
meant
to
deal
with
markets
which
are
that
small
with
which
our
communities
under
the
old
section
7
standard,
you
must
establish
an
economically
substantial
market.
and
this
$2.5
billion,
los
angeles
retail
grocery
market
was
substantial,
it's
as
large
as
many
industries.
and
calling
these
two
firms
small
locally-owned
operators
can't
disguise
the
fact
that
by
all
reasonable
standards,
these
are
major
corporations
with
the
--
with
combined
sales
of
$185
million
a
year
and
a
merger
between
them,
if
it
has
the
competitive
effects
which
the
statute
proscribes
is
of
--
is
certainly
substantial
enough
to
be
of
federal
concern
under
section
7.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
we
accept
the
findings
as
to
basic
facts.
we
take
issue
with
those
findings
which
are
conlusory
or
which
are
cast
in
conclusory
fashion
and
we
take
issues
specifically
with
finding
number
80,
which
stated
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
finding
number
80,
stated
that
there
has
been
decreasing
concentration
in
the
relevant
market.
this
is
based
on
as
i've
suggested
statistical
information
which
is
not
completely
accurate
and
moreover,
even
--
as
mentioned
earlier,
even
accepting
appellees
figures,
it's
clear
that
while
safeway
perhaps
and
ralphs
may
have
suffered
some
market
share
diminution.
the
largest
firms
as
a
group
have
grown
steadily
and
substantially.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
don't
think
we
would
because
we
regard,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
as
very
significant,
the
fact
not
only
that
this
market
had
reached
a
level
under
threshold
of
oligopoly
but
that
the
direction
was
towards
greater
and
greater
levels
of
concentration.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
the
--
we
must
disagree
with
the
conclusion
stated
in
finding
80.
i
don't
think
that
requires
disagreement
with
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
finding,
we
think
is
clearly
erroneous
in
it
so
far
as
it
states
a
conclusion
that
concentration
has
been
decreasing.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
true,
and
we
suggest
that
reading
--
that
even
accepting
all
of
defendant
statistics,
it's
still
clear
except
the
--
all
the
statistics
on
the
record.
it's
still
clear
that
concentration
has
in
the
main
increased
even
though
it's
conceivable
that
a
few
firms
have
dropped.
so
i
might
mention
that
that
finding
80,
one
of
the
factors
which
the
judge
relied
on
in
finding
that
concentration
was
decreasing,
was
his
finding
that
entry
is
easy.
now,
quite
apart
from
what
is
clear
error,
there's
an
illogicality
there
because
where
the
entry
is
--
no
matter
how
easy
entry
is,
the
fact
of
easy
entry
doesn't
mean
that
concentration
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
may
not
be
increasing.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct,
because
you
don't
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
if
you
find
that
this
is
not
a
market
which
is
jeopardized
in
which
there's
a
danger
of
increasing
concentration,
we
do
not
suggest
that
the
merger
itself
in
some
other
market
setting,
by
reason
of
the
size
of
the
firms
would
be
illegal.
