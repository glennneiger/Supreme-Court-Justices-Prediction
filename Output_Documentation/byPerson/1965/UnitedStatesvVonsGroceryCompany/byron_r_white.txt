justice

white
and
there
was
no
issue
of
the
effect
on
primary
lined
up
or
is
it
just
--
someone
with
headers?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
journeys
you
have
--
the
effect
on
any
--
on
the
supplier?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
the
extent
that
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
what
the
trend
in
is
since
1958,
at
least
the
latest
percentage
figures
in
that
essentially.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
--
is
that
a
finding
or
it's
finding
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
--
what
safeway's
history
since
1958?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
shares
go
up
or
down?
you
don't
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
varies
with
ralphs
though
--
if
there
is
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
you
--
did
you
say
to
synthesize
the
total
market
figures
for
1963?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
did
the
record
close
in
this
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
1964,
1963
or
1964?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
posner,
wouldn't
you
agree
though
that
it's
the
--
if
between
1958
and
1963,
the
top
20
firms
changed
100%
that
there
might
be
some
question
about
the
--
whether
there
was
any
damage
to
the
competition.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
none
of
the
top
20
in
1963
were
among
the
top
20
in
1958,
it
would
be
somewhat
difficult
to
say
that
the
competition
was
negative
in
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
is
the
situation
as
among
these
firms,
are
they
all
in
the
same
firms,
they're
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
roughly
that
the
record
would
sustain
the
top
20
firms
in
1963
or
roughly
the
top
20
firms
in
1958
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
holds
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
among
the
leading
firms
and
if
they're
--
and
if
the
share
of
the
top
20
that's
increasing
is
the
share
of
the
same
firms
roughly
--
justice
byron
r.
white
when
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
posner,
you
say
this
market
had
turned
the
corner
of
the
--
on
the
appellee,
could
you
give
me
just
say
a
brief
run
down
on
what
the
government's
theory
is
in
terms
of
what
consequences
flow
from
being
able
to
label
some
market
as
oligopolistic?
i
mean
what
--
i
take
it
that
it
involves
the
idea
that
the
fewer
the
competitors
the
less
the
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
--
and
what?
high
concentration
and
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
see
--
price
competition
is
diminishing
in
the
price
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
you
don't
suggest
that
sale
in
los
angeles
do
you,
about
new
entry?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
--
what
do
you
say
about
the
identity
of
the
top
eight
and
the
top
20
firms
in
the
last
15
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
--
what
about
the
public
served
in
1958,
have
served
the
top
eight
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
and
does
the
top
20
through
1958
and
1963?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
at
the
top
eight?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
among
themselves
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do
say
that
the
--
i
gather
that
1958
to
1963
the
top
eight
remain
the
same
--
then
they
say
there
the
total
market
shares.
justice
byron
r.
white
declined
over
these
five
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
where
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
these
are
the
only
figures
from
1963?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that?
it
doesn't
relate
to
this
question
of
the
relative
shares
--
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
they
have
it
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
feel
that
the
government's
position
requires
this
court
to
take
issue
with
--
that
we
agreed
to
take
issue
with
any
findings
of
the
district
court
other
than
just
solve
them
a
conclusion
about
effect
on
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
you
agreed
on
the
basic
facts
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
may
not
be
but
do
you
--
the
government
and
you
have
any
disagreement
with
regard
to
any
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
finding
is
this
eight
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
are
you
suggesting
that
would
be
more
vulnerable
as
it
would
be
--
that
the
situation
would
be
more
vulnerable
if
you
acquired
a
single-store
than
if
you
acquire
a
chain?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
take
issue
with
the
government
on
this
basic
idea
that
the
--
if
you
are
the
competitors
to
less
the
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
think
there's
--
there's
come
a
point
in
the
market
where
there's
sufficient
concentration
that
the
--
there's
a
danger
of
injury
to
competition
from
an
acquisition
by
one
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
it's
less
--
that
you
think
it's
less
likely
that
there
will
be
vigorous
competition
among
a
few
large
competitors
than
among
many
smaller
ones?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
with
the
government
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
say
that
this
concept
of
the
government
this
has
no
place
in
the
grocery
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
percentage
does
this
market
did
certified's
members
sell?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
--
despite,
you
think
that
the
number
of
retailers
is
going
up
or
going
down
out
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
i
know,
but
i
didn't
ask
about
the
number
of
stores,
i
asked
about
number
of
competitors.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
you
--
do
you
think
the
trend
is
that
fewer
and
fewer
competitors
sharing
the
$2.5
billion
gross
sale?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
it
is
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
posner,
do
you
accept
all
the
findings
of
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
you
agreed
with
that
finding,
would
--
you
wouldn't
be
here
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
have
to
give
them
the
record
and
disagree
with
the
district
judge
before
we
--
we
can
agree
with
you.
