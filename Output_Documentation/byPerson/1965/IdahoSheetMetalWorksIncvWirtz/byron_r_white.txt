byron
r.
white
you
don't
disagree
--
you
don't
disagree
with
the
kentucky
finance,
i
take
it,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
agree
then
with
the
solicitor
that
in
any
--
in
any
of
these
cases
we
must
at
the
outset,
go
through
a
course
of
the
--
or
answer
of
a
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
any
retail
sale
as
traditionally
recognized
or
take
--
take
the
court
as
you
do
--
that
the
court
did
in
kentucky
finance.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
go
through
the
question
--
we
ask
the
question
but
what
you
say
automatically
answers
it
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
it
if
it
isn't
--
what
is
it
if
it's
not
for
resale
that
the
industry
doesn't
think
it's
for
retail
than
it's
a
retail,
what
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it's
--
what
if
it's
not
for
resale?
the
sale
is
not
for
resale
but
the
industry
does
treat
it
as
a
retail
sale.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
not
--
it's
not
--
it's
not
retail.
justice
byron
r.
white
ms.
margolin,
aside
from
the
specific
reference
to
the
legislative
history,
do
you
really
see
any
difference
between
this
case
and
the
sheet
metal
case?
it
doesn't
--
it's
one
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
that
--
isn't
that
part
of
the
business?
is
there
any
real
difference
between
this
case
and
the
other
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
one
--
one
case
ought
to
be
decided
like
the
other.
