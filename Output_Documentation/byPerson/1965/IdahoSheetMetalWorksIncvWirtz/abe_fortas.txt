justice
abe
fortas
but
there
is
a
question
as
if
they're
certain
about
the
third
standard
as
set
forth
in
your
brief
and
there's
whether
75%
of
the
annual
total
volume
of
your
sales
are
recognized
in
a
particular
industry
as
retail
sales.
justice
abe
fortas
which
i
guess
is
that
there's
no
testimony
in
the
record
to
that
come
from.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
eberle,
excuse
me
sir.
i
note
that
your
argument
is
and
perhaps
it
has
to
be
that
our
decision
in
roland
against
walling
in
326
u.s.
was
modified
by
the
1949
amendments
through
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
these
are
--
i
don't
see
anything
in
your
brief,
perhaps
i
missed
it,
pointing
to
any
part
of
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
the
intention
on
congress'
part
and
they
do
that
with
respect
to
the
definition
of
--
with
respect
to
the
concept
of
retailers,
what
it
is
within
the
concept
of
a
retail
store.
is
there
anything
that
you'd
been
pointing
through
in
that
respect?
justice
abe
fortas
senator
pepper
said
that
sales
to
manufacturing
companies
were
not
to
be
considered
retail
sales?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
ms.
margolin,
do
we
have
somewhere
and
do
you
recall
what
the
tennessee
--
how
the
tennessee
sales
tax
law
is
phrased?
does
it
use
the
word
retail
or
does
it
--?
justice
abe
fortas
oh
--
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
tennessee
sales
tax
use
that
as
an
example?
justice
abe
fortas
it
is.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
in
your
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
it's
quite
--
justice
abe
fortas
ms.
margolin,
i
don't
quite
understand
your
illustration
of
the
sale
of
large
tire
for
earthmover
tractor,
if
there
were
just
one
sale
by
an
establishment
to
a
particular
company
engaged
in
that
business,
and
that
one
sale
consisted
of
one
tire,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
your
position
that
that
nevertheless
could
not
be
a
retail
sale
because
it
is
a
sale
made
to
someone
who's
engaged
in
business?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
indulge
me
if
i'm
not
because
i
try
to
get
your
theory.
let's
suppose
that
a
tire
company
sold
one
tire
to
a
factory
engaged
in
production
for
interstate
commerce,
is
it
your
theory
that
that
tire
could
not
be
included
in
the
definition
of
retail
sales
either
for
purposes
of
computing
the
75%
or
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
this
is
a
retail
establishment?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
the
statute
that
you
regard
as
supporting
rep?
justice
abe
fortas
please
forgive
me
for
taking
so
much
of
your
time
but
i
do
want
to
ask
you
one
more
question.
i
take
it
that
that
your
argument
is
that
where
the
statute
says
that
requires
that
the
establishment
quote
“is
recognized
as
retail
sales
of
services
in
a
particular
industry”
that
your
argument
that
is
recognized
as
retail
sales
in
a
particular
industry
does
not
mean
the
classification
or
the
category
or
the
conceptual
description
in
the
particular
industry
but
it
does
project
that
we
have
to
look
at
the
general
practices
in
the
industry,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
abe
fortas
which
you
do
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
have
to
do
something
of
those
words,
don't
you?
it
is
recognized
as
retail
sales
in
the
industry.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
burch,
did
you
did
you
say
page
33
of
the
government's
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
whereas
the
record
here
as
to
senator
holland
--
justice
abe
fortas
holland.
senator
spessard
holland.
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps
i'm
misreading
it.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
burch,
suppose
that
--
in
the
oil
company
sold
its
entire
output
to
industrial
companies
and
that
oil
were
used
in
the
generating
heat
and
energy
in
their
operations.
now,
that
is
a
sale,
it's
not
for
resale.
if
the
oil
industry
had
a
practice
of
referring
to
this
as
retail,
would
that
bring
it
within
the
statutory
exemption
in
your
opinion?
