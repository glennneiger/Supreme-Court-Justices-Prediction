justice
john
m.
harlan
i
want
to
ask
if
the
complicated
statute
or
provisions
in
the
making
of
potential
do
you
think
is
the
pivotal
aspect.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
this
pivotal
aspect
of
the
(inaudible)
establish
the
fact
of
the
case
is
75%?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
these
questions
because
identifying
the
reference,
the
legislative
history
in
your
brief
and
the
government
has
agreed
upon.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
i
take
it
that
you
take
issue
with
the
government's
summary
of
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
fact
by
the
legislative
history.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
--
how
many
employees
are
there
in
a
store?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
revert
the
essence
of
that
decision.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
saying,
i
take
it,
is
that
the
kentucky
finance
control
this
case
but
you
are
suffering
to
the
extent
of
saying
there's
something
by
targeting
this
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
were
you
at
some
point
to
explain
what
content
should
you
use
what
part
of
the
act
this
fellow
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
certainly,
you
didn't
rest
on
that
very
hardly
that
because
of
an
argument
with
the
sale
of
the
service.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
that
is
traditional
and
characteristic
to
treat
quantity
discounted
sales
are
not
for
resale
as
retail
sale.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
there
can
be
sales
and
there
can
be
sales
anyway
that
are
not
for
resale
but
are
retail?
