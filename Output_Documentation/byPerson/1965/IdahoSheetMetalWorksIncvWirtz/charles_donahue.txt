mr.
charles
donahue
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
in
this
case
that
my
brother
here
is
apparently
asking
this
court
to
reverse
itself
in
the
position
which
he
took
in
the
kentucky
finance
case,
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
harlan.
to
the
effect
that
there
exists
in
the
statute
what
has
become
in
familiar
terms
to
be
known
as
a
retail
concept
and
i
would
like
further
to
say
at
the
outset
that
the
issue
here
is
limited
to
the
proper
interpretation
and
application
of
the
retail
and
service
to
establishment
exemption
at
it
is
contained
in
13
(a)
(2)
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
not
whether
or
not
the
activities
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
are
essential
to
production.
that
question
was
laid
at
rest
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
certiorari
was
limited
in
this
case
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
was
within
the
retail
exemption.
i
wish
to
emphasize
that
because
it
has
already
been
found
and
determined
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
is
not
questioned
here
that
this
petitioner
was
engaged
in
activities
necessary
to
production
for
interstate
commerce.
now,
i
think
that
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
a
pivotal
question
here,
rather,
he
said,
what
is
the
pivotal
aspect
of
the
retail
and
the
service
establishment
exemption
here.
and
i
think
the
pivotal
aspect
of
it
is
that
we
are
not
here
in
this
case,
none
of
the
facts,
which
i
will
briefly
explain.
we
are
not
here
at
the
end
of
the
flow
of
commerce.
we
are
not
involved
with
the
sale
of
groceries
in
a
local
store
to
an
ultimate
consumer,
but
instead,
we
are
in
the
midstream
of
interstate
commerce.
we
have
a
firm
here
which
is
manufacturing
goods
which
is
assisting
and
doing
work
which
is
necessary
to
production
of
goods
for
interstate
commerce
by
large
sizable
processing
companies.
now,
we
believe
that
this
case
and
the
following
case
number
31,
the
steepleton
case
are
both
controlled
by
this
court's
decisions
in
mitchell
versus
the
kentucky
finance
company
and
in
the
roland
electric
company.
these
two
cases
combined,
stands
squarely
for
the
proposition
that
sales
and
services
of
the
idaho
sheet
metal
works
in
this
case
are
predominantly
and
clearly
outside
what
is
known
as
the
retail
concept
actually
first
having
its
formation
in
the
roland
electric
case
in
1946
and
strongly
reaffirmed
by
this
court
in
the
kentucky
finance
case
to
such
an
extent
that
the
sales
and
services
and
the
establishment
in
question
cannot
in
any
sense
be
considered
as
within
the
retail
and
service
establishment
exemption
of
13
(a)
(2)
of
the
fair
labor
standards
acts.
now,
involved
here,
we
have
a
sheet
metal
firm,
and
not
just
a
tin
shop.
we
cannot
look
at
this
as
it
was
at
the
turn
of
the
century
or
is
it
maybe
even
at
this
moment
we
have
to
look
at
what
this
firm
as
shown
by
the
record
to
be,
one
the
court
of
appeals
found
it
to
be
during
the
years
1959
to
1961
which
are
the
years
involved
in
this
case.
during
that
three-year
period,
we
have
affirmed
which
the
court
of
appeals
found
as
manufacturing,
installing,
maintaining,
and
repairing
sheet
metal
equipment
for
five
large
potato
processors
producing
goods
for
interstate
commerce.
83%
of
the
defendant's
gross
income
was
derived
from
these
customers
and
i
think
the
total
amount
was
something
in
excess
of
a
total
valid
volume
of
$500,000.
mr.
charles
donahue
sir?
mr.
charles
donahue
they
repaired
and
maintained
potato
processing
equipment
which
in
turn
was
used
to
dehydrate
or
prepare
potatoes
for
shipment
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
charles
donahue
they
fabricated
the
articles,
as
i
understand
it,
in
the
shop
or
on
the
job
depending
upon
the
needs
of
the
particular
situation.
mr.
charles
donahue
it
was
a
manufacturing
process
as
found
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
charles
donahue
the
items
which
they
manufactured,
mr.
chief
justice,
were
hoods
for
carrying
of
steel,
tanks,
some
as
large
as
to
hold
5000
pounds
of
peeled
potatoes,
elevator
buckets
and
shoots
for
transferring
items
within
the
plant
from
one
place
to
the
other.
and
as
the
--
as
my
brother
says,
there
was
considerable
work
during
the
down
periods
when
the
constant
improvement
was
attempted
to
be
made
in
the
--
and
greater
efficiency
assured
in
the
manufacturing
process.
those
largely
are
the
facts
which
we
face
here.
we
--
turning
to
the
law
have
also
involved
in
13
(a)
(2)
a
provision
which
requires
that
there
should
be
an
exemption
from
the
minimum
wage
and
overtime
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
for
retail
and
service
establishments.
a
retail
and
service
establishment
is
defined
in
the
statute.
it
is
defined
as
an
establishment
75%
whose
annual
dollar
volume
of
sales
is
not
for
resale
and
is
recognized
as
retail
sales
of
services
in
the
industry.
now,
despite
the
--
i
think
that
it
rather
affirms
the
--
my
brother's
request
in
effect
that
the
court
reverse
itself
in
this
case
in
that
he
cites
in
his
brief
and
seems
to
agree
that
there
does
exist
in
the
law
a
retail
concept
which
is
a
hurdle
one
must
get
over
before
reaching
the
words
of
the
definition.
he
says,
and
i
quote,
“the
support
--
the
court
in
kentucky
finance
has
interpreted
the
act
in
such
a
way
as
to
impose
what
he
calls
an
additional
requirement
namely;
that
the
industry
under
consideration
to
be
considered
retail
under
traditional
concepts.
now,
it
is
of
course
our
position
based
upon
the
roland
electric
case
and
the
legislative
history
that
this
statutory
retail
concept
both
existed
before
and
was
affirmed
by
the
1949
amendments
to
the
retail
exemptions.
mr.
charles
donahue
it
was
--
mr.
charles
donahue
--
a
part
of
the
roland
electric
case,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
part
that
concerned
the
congress
was
really
dicta
in
that
case
and
unnecessary
to
the
decision.
it
was
that
part
of
the
case
which
affirmed
the
administrators
of
the
interpretative
bulletin
which
said
that
any
sale
for
a
business
use
was
a
nonretail
sale
and
that
got
down
to
the
absurdity
in
the
minds
of
congressmen
in
practice
--
quite
rightly
so
of
a
bell
boy
from
a
hotel
going
around
the
corner
to
a
retail
shop
and
buy
some
towels
because
he
needs
to
put
them
in
the
bathroom,
being
called
a
nonretail
sale
and
a
housewife
going
in
and
buying
the
same
towel
and
would
be
called
a
retail
sale.
this
is
what
congress
sought
to
correct.
mr.
charles
donahue
i
would
not
regard
it
as
material
here
that
the
sheet
metal
for
example
which
was
used
in
the
fabricating
plant
of
the
petitioner
came
from
either
inside
of
idaho
or
outside
of
idaho.
the
point
is
it
was
necessary
for
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce
in
the
potato
processing
plants.
now,
the
roland
--
mr.
charles
donahue
sir?
mr.
charles
donahue
in
this
case,
it
is
that
type
of
transaction
constituting
approximately
about
86%
of
the
business
during
this
three-year
period
we're
talking
about.
the
holding
in
the
roland
electric
case
as
distinguished
from
the
dicta
which
i
was
just
questioned
about
by
mr.
justice
stewart
was
that
where
affirms
are
doing
precisely
that
namely;
they're
doing
work
which
is
necessary
to
production.
then
in
this
case,
in
the
roland
case,
it
happened
to
be
repairing,
fixing,
and
furnishing
electric
generators
and
motors
to
many
different
customers
who
in
turn
were
producing
and
manufacturing
for
interstate
commerce.
and
the
court
said
that
the
keywords
that
the
court
used
here
are
that
the
act
does
not
exempt
this
retail
and
i
quote,
"the
multitude
of
employees
were
engaged
in
establishments
which
supply
the
materials
and
services
currently
needed
for
the
maintenance
of
productive
machinery
used
by
those
who
produced
goods
for
interstate
commerce."
now,
the
court
added
to
that
that
these
employees
are
in
the
middle
of
the
flow
of
goods
in
commerce.
it
commented
that
it
would
take
the
heart
out
of
the
act,
to
fail
to
reach
these
employees
engaged
in
these
activities.
and
they
concluded
that
the
exemption
reaches
employees
only
of
such
retail
or
service
establishments
as
a
comparable
to
the
local
merchants
of
the
opponent
grocer
or
the
filling
station
operator
who
sells
their
services
ultimate
to
consumers
and
work
of
that
sought.
now,
this
case,
this
roland
electric
case,
is
very
much
alive
today
and
the
principal
reason
why
i
believe
it
is
alive
is
the
kentucky
finance
case
which
in
effect
affirmed
the
existence
of
his
retail
concept
that
roland
in
substance
established.
now,
in
kentucky
finance,
this
court
was
considering
the
continuing
vitality
of
this
traditional
retail
concept.
after,
mind
you,
after
the
1949
amendments
had
added
the
so-called
industry
recognition
test
to
the
statute.
and
the
court
correctly
emphasized
again
that
the
sole
purpose
of
congress
in
amending
of
the
statute
was
to
overrule
the
so-called
business
use
test
that
is
any
sales
for
business
use
is
a
nonretail
sale
which
was
generally
approved
in
dicta
in
the
roland
case
and
as
to
which
this
court
said,
“we
find
nothing
in
the
debates
or
the
reports
which
suggest
that
congress
intended
by
the
amendment
to
broaden
the
fields
of
business
enterprise
to
which
the
exemption
would
apply.
and
thus,
at
the
very
least
where
congress
ruled
the
senate
and
house
reports
explicitly
stated
that
certain
business
activities
were
not
exempted
by
the
1949
amendments.
such
businesses
are
clearly
outside
the
retail
concept
regardless
of
what
the
industry
thinks
or
says
or
recognizes.
now,
kentucky
finance
was
dealing
with
credit
companies.
and
these
were
found
by
congress
to
be
expressly
excluded
from
any
continuing
retail
concept.
and
now,
on
this
case
--
mr.
charles
donahue
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
in
--
mr.
charles
donahue
i
believe
that
it
is
to
--
mr.
charles
donahue
it
was
very
explicit.
it
pointed
them
out
specifically
as
one
of
the
--
a
host
of
different
activities
and
types
of
businesses
that
should
not
possess
the
retail
concept
--
mr.
charles
donahue
it
explicitly
mentioned
the
credit
company.
mr.
charles
donahue
now
in
this
case
--
mr.
charles
donahue
well,
i
believe
your
honors
that
despite
the
understating
our
position
i'm
really
saying
that
roland
has
full
force
and
vigor
and
the
congress
in
the
legislative
history
expressly
preserved
the
roland
area,
not
only
by
name
of
the
case
itself
but
also
by
saying
as
i
was
about
to
say
here
that
congress
expressly
declared
as
outside
the
retail
concept
any
business
which
is
engaged
in
the
sale
and
i'm
quoting
the
exact
words,
"the
sale
and
servicing
of
manufactured
equipment
used
in
the
production
of
goods."
and
in
this
case,
as
in
the
roland
case
which
i
wanted
to
emphasize
again
was
expressly
saved
by
the
congress,
was
preserved
by
the
legislative
history.
we
have
sales
and
servicing
of
manufactured
equipment
used
in
the
production
of
goods
and
that
therefore
this
case
is
governed
by
the
combination
of
kentucky
finance
and
for
roland.
now,
there
are
two
cases
which
have
been
decided
by
my
brother
which
i'd
like
to
refer
to
briefly
before
concluding.
the
first
is
the
modern
trashmoval
case
decided
in
the
fourth
circuit
a
couple
of
years
ago.
now,
in
this
case,
the
fourth
circuit
held
among
other
things
that
trash
removal
services
were
not
outside
the
traditional
retail
concept.
now,
in
so
doing,
the
court
referred
to
the
kentucky
finance
decision
and
recognized
as
held
in
that
case
that
there
are
fields
which
completely
lack
a
retail
concept
such
as
finance
and
there
are
business
activities
which
had
been
specifically
mentioned
by
congress
as
being
ineligible
where
an
exemption
for
a
retail
of
service
establishments.
the
court
noted
that
trash
removal
held
in
either
one
of
these
categories
and
ultimately
decided
that
it
was
within
the
retail
concept
and
the
retail
activity.
the
truck
contrast
of
course
with
this
case
is
obvious.
now,
here
in
this
case,
the
business
activity
of
idaho
sheet
metal
works
fell
precisely
within
those
specifically
mentioned
by
congress
as
being
ineligible
for
exemption
as
retail
or
service
establishments.
there
is
one
further
case
which
deserves
to
be
called
in
the
attention
of
the
court
--
mr.
charles
donahue
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
--
perhaps
as
my
concluding
remarks
simply
by
further
reference
to
the
question
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
concerning
their
being
involved
in
kentucky
finance,
a
credit
company
which
fell
in
a
list
of
those
companies
outside
the
retail
concept
as
expressly
stated
by
the
congress
and
in
re-referring
myself
to
that
case,
i
reassure
myself
that
the
court
in
that
case,
and
i
quote
said,
and
repeat
from
four,
"we
find
nothing
in
the
debates
or
reports
which
suggest
that
congress
intended
by
the
amendment
to
broaden
the
fields
of
business
enterprise
to
which
the
exemption
would
apply,
meaning
that
if
it
applied
before
1949
as
expressly
so
determined
at
that
time
or
if
it
fell
in
a
class
that
was
--
of
a
type
which
was
mentioned
before
1949,
then
it
was
of
the
kind
not
necessarily
of
the
exact
type
mentioned
but
of
the
kind
which
the
congress
and
the
administrator
intended
to
continue
to
be
entitled
to
or
ineligible
for
the
exemption.
to
emphasize
that
point,
i
wish
to
also
to
indicate
that
the
court
in
that
case
merely
referred
to
the
expressed
mentioning
by
congress
of
credit
companies
to
remove
what
it
called
any
residual
doubt.
it
was
expressly
mentioned,
therefore
doubly,
it
was
outside
the
retail
exemption.
another
point,
in
order
to
remove
any
residual
doubt
in
my
case,
so
far
as
the
roland
electric
company
is
concerned,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
colloquy
of
questions
and
answers
put
by
senator
spessard
holland
in
florida,
who
was
the
sponsor
of
this
retail
amendment
in
1949.
the
question
is,
and
i
quote
from
it,
from
the
record,
"in
roland
electric
company
versus
walling,
the
supreme
court
held
that
a
company
engaged
in
selling
industrial
goods
and
services
to
manufacturers
engaged
in
the
production
of
goods
for
interstate
commerce
and
to
other
industrial
and
business
customers
were
not
a
retail
service
establishment.
would
that
case
be
decided
any
differently
under
the
proposed
amendment?
the
answer,
definitely
from
--
mr.
charles
donahue
the
answer
is
given
by
senator
holland
himself
to
a
question
which
he
asked
himself
on
this
floor.
it's
the
answer
to
his
own
question.
his
answer
is,
"definitely
not.
the
sale
and
servicing
of
manufacturing
machinery
and
manufacturing
equipment
used
in
the
production
of
goods
is
not
regarded
as
retail
servicing
or
selling
in
the
industry
which
distributes
self
services
that
type
of
equipment.
now,
turning
to
the
case
which
i
was
about
to
discuss
ever
so
briefly
before
we
recess
for
lunch,
it
is
wirtz
versus
the
english
oil
service
decided
in
april
of
this
past
year.
the
court
as
attention
is
called
to
this
case
by
the
petitioner
apparently
to
be
relied
upon
in
support
of
his
position.
but
far
from
supporting
his
position,
the
court
ruled
quite
the
opposite
and
held
that
an
enterprise
whose
primary
business
is
the
holding
away
and
disposing
in
saltwater
and
basic
sediment
from
producing
oil
wells
services
closely
related
and
directly
essential
to
production
for
interstate
commerce
could
not
qualify
for
the
retail
and
service
exemption
even
though
such
services
are
considered
retail
within
the
oil
industry.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
this
case
distinguished
modern
trashmoval
because
the
fourth
circuit
answered
the
initial
inquiry
which
the
court
said
was
important
here
as
to
the
retail
concept.
in
the
affirmative,
in
the
case
at
bar
as
in
the
english
oil
company,
plainly,
the
initial
inquiry
must
be
answered
in
the
negative
here
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
since
over
80%
of
the
petitioner's
gross
annual
income
is
derived
from
sales
and
services
probably
outside
the
statutory
retail
and
service
establishment
concept,
we
submit,
that
the
petitioner
cannot
qualify
for
this
exemption.
