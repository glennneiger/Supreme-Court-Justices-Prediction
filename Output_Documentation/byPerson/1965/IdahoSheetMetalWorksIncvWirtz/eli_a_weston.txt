mr.
eli
a.
weston
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
sole
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
the
retail
establishment
exemption,
provided
in
section
13
(a)
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
case
was
tried
in
the
southern
district
of
idaho
before
the
honorable
fred
taylor
after
a
pretrial
stipulation
with
which
it
was
agreed
the
sole
issues
of
whether
or
not
the
petitioner's
establishment
was
considered
a
retail
establishment
within
the
industry.
a
second
issue
was
in
the
stipulation
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
a
mixed
issue
of
fact
and
law
as
to
whether
or
not
the
petitioner's
establishment
complied
with
the
so-called
retail
concept.
after
a
two-day
of
trial
in
which
seven
or
eight
witnesses
were
introduced,
the
court
made
findings
of
fact
which
among
other
things
stated
as
follows,
the
defendant
is
engaged
in
the
city
of
burley,
a
small
farming
community
in
the
state
of
idaho
in
the
making,
selling
and
installing,
and
repairing
of
sheet
metal
products
including
the
sale
of
southern
sheet
metal,
waterspouts,
elbows,
and
similar
items.
and
that
during
the
years
1959
and
1960
and
1961,
the
defendant's
products
and
services
were
sold
concede
no
processors
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
the
sale
and
services
for
the
most
part
made
and
rendered
intermittently
enduring
the
down
seasons.
that
the
defendant's
business
was
established
with
a
purpose
of
serving
the
city
of
burley
and
the
surrounding
community
making
sales
and
rendering
services
to
a
variety
of
customers
predominantly
in
number
of
sales
to
farmers,
ranchers,
and
local
individuals
and
businesses.
all
of
the
defendant's
sales
of
services
were
in
the
state
of
idaho
and
on
a
retail
basis.
the
defendant's
business
is
local
in
its
nature,
was
established
for
the
purpose
of
serving
the
burley
area,
and
it's
not
closely
related
to
nor
directly
essential
to
the
production
of
goods
for
or
in
commerce
but
for
the
primary
purpose
of
serving
local
needs.
that
the
products
sold
and
services
rendered
to
the
processing
communities
where
for
the
most
part
similar
to
items
which
could
be
and
sometimes
are
fabricated
by
the
processing
companies
in
their
in-plant
shops.
the
products
produced
by
the
defendant
do
not
enter
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce.
the
defendant's
prices
per
services
and
product
are
computed
on
the
same
basis
for
all
customers.
fabricated
parts
are
uniformly
priced
on
the
basis
of
material
operating
cost
and
its
profit.
the
defendant's
non-fabricated
products
such
as
steels,
solder,
and
other
items
are
displayed
on
racks
or
shelves
and
are
similar
in
this
respect
to
what
is
described
a
tin
shop.
the
defendant's
establishment
is
recognized
as
a
retail
establishment
by
the
defendant
and
salesmen
within
the
industry
and
none
of
the
sales
made
by
the
defendant
were
for
resale.
based
on
this
pretrial
stipulation
and
the
evidence
in
the
case,
the
court
found
that
the
petitioner's
establishment
was
not
closely
related
to
or
directly
essential
to
interstate
commerce.
and
i
believe
the
finding
was
based
somewhat
on
the
decision
by
this
court
in
zachry
versus
mitchell
which
the
late
immanent
jurist,
justice
frankfurter
in
the
opinion
in
which
there
were
three
or
four
dissenters
ruled
that
it
was
perhaps
time
that
we
examined
the
question
of
how
far
the
government
should
go
in
regulating
or
encroaching
upon
what
is
in
effect
a
purely
local
business
set
up
to
regulate
or
set
up
to
serve
a
local
community.
mr.
eli
a.
weston
zachry
versus
--
mitchell
versus
zachry.
mr.
eli
a.
weston
mitchell
versus
zachry
case.
mr.
eli
a.
weston
in
mitchell
versus
zachry
case,
a
city
had
built
a
dam
or
impounded
water
and
it
developed
that
the
water
from
this
dam
was
being
used
by
people
who
were
engaged
to
producing
goods
for
commerce.
there's
a
very
similar
and
there's
a
great
deal
of
similarity
between
the
two
cases
because
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
the
purpose
of
the
dam
or
the
purpose
of
the
impounding
of
the
water
was
to
serve
the
local
community
and
that
50%
or
more
of
the
sales
of
this
water
was
to
the
community
and
in
point
of
number,
i
think
this
is
what
then
goes
to
the
court
somewhat.
in
point
of
number
of
sales,
not
the
total
volume,
this
establishment
had
maybe
a
thousand
sales
to
what
the
record
shows
versus
six
or
seven
sales
to
producers
who
were
in
the
interstate
commerce
in
the
point
of
number.
the
court
also
found
of
course
that
we
were
a
retail
establishment
as
defined
by
the
1949
amendment
of
the
fair
labor
standard
act.
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
court
reversed
the
district
court
on
both
counts.
and
we're
here
now
on
certiorari
on
the
one
question
of
whether
or
not
we
are
a
retail
establishment.
unless
the
court
has
some
question
in
mind
that
i
could
more
or
less
direct
my
attention
to,
i
believe
that
the
case
before
this
court
involves
two
rather
serious
questions.
number
one,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
based
on
the
facts
which
i've
proposed
to
enlarge
upon,
a
fact-finding
tribunal
or
a
district
court
after
hearing
all
the
testimonies
and
after
examining
the
pretrial
stipulation
and
far
as
in
this
case,
there
was
only
one
witness
for
the
government
which
was
a
professor
who
had
graduated
from
washington
university
and
who
admitted
that
he
had
no
experience
whatsoever
in
the
retail
sheet
metal
industry
or
tin
shops,
and
where
he
admitted
that
his
own
experience
was
with
trading
stamps
and
items
of
that
kind.
whether
or
not
under
that
record
is
proper
for
this
court
to
brush
it
aside
or
for
the
ninth
circuit
court
to
brush
it
inside
and
we
say,
“we
pay
no
attention
to
those
findings
of
fact”.
most
of
those
findings
of
fact,
if
the
court
please,
were
undisputed.
there
wasn't
any
question
about
it.
the
stipulation,
the
pretrial
stipulation,
specifically
provides
that
the
only
issue
before
that
court
was
whether
or
not
this
establishment
was
considered
a
retail
establishment
within
the
industry.
mr.
eli
a.
weston
i
think
the
pivotable
aspect,
put
it
that
way,
justice
harlan,
i
believe
that
question
of
whether
or
not
this
establishment
having
been
set
up
to
serve
a
community,
it
was
serving
a
community
with
the
great
--
largest
majority
of
the
sales
and
the
small
sales
to
the
ultimate
consumer
and
not
for
resale
that
that
should
enjoy
or
should
have
the
retail
establishment
exemption
under
section
13
(a)
(2),
if
i
understand
your
question.
i
think
we're
involved
here
now
in,
number
one,
an
interpretation
of
the
1949
amendment.
does
it
mean
what
it
says?
i
frankly
am
much
concerned
about
the
constant
use
of
this
term
“retail
concept”.
i
don't
know
how
you
got
into
my
case.
i
don't
know
how
you
got
into
the
law.
but
i
do
know
that
that
is
the
thing
that
the
administrator
or
the
secretary
is
now
hanging
on
to
for
all
the
other
facts
indicated.
it
would
may
even
be
isolated
from
the
production
of
commerce
or
it
would
may
have
all
of
the
other
qualifications
of
a
retail
establishment.
now,
i
think
the
1949
amendment
either
means
exactly
what
it
says,
or
it
doesn't
and
i
think
it's
time
frankly
that
we
give
the
interpretation
that
the
congress
intended
as
i
read
the
amendment.
part
of
1949,
the
administrator
was
given
the
authority
to
interpret
the
question
of
what
was
or
was
not
paid
and
what
was
or
what
was
not
a
retail
establishment.
and
in
those
interpretative
bulletins
which
were
numerous
went
into
the
very
many
facets
of
this
question.
did
it
look
like
a
retail
store?
did
it
have
shelves?
did
it
have
a
cash
register?
did
it
sell
in
small
items
like
a
box
of
matches
or
a
bunch
of
bananas?
was
it
to
the
ultimate
consumer?
and
in
his
first
interpretative
bulletins
and
in
his
first
regulations,
he
limited
the
retail
establishment
to
--
almost
to
the
corner
stores
who
have
so
heavily
stated
in
the
kentucky
finance
case.
the
congress
apparently
because
even
in
those
definitions,
he
used
the
business
use
test
and
he
used
the
fleet
test,
all
of
these
various
items
that
the
administrator
used
to
determine
what
was
or
was
not
a
retail
establishment.
in
my
opinion
were
considered
too
restrictive
because
as
the
courts
--
i
believe
the
congressional
record
shows
one
of
the
senators
made
the
illustrations.
he
said,
“if
i
go
to
a
store
and
buy
two
towels
for
my
home,
that's
the
retail
sale
but
if
a
hotel
goes
and
buy
as
a
gross
of
towels,
that's
under
your
interpretation
is
considered
nonretail.
if
i
happened
to
have
a
store
and
i
buy
fleeted
cars
to
deliver
my
goods
you
say
that's
nonretail
because
of
the
size.
if
i
give
one
customer
a
reduction
because
he
buys
more
than
another,
you
say
that's
nonretail.
and
i
honestly
believe
that
the
congress
in
the
1949
amendment
said
to
the
administrator,
“now
let's
understand,
there's
only
two
tests
that
you're
allowed
to
apply.
one
is,
are
these
sales
for
a
resale?
and
two
is,
is
this
considered
a
retail
establishment
within
the
industry?
now,
that
1949
amendment
was
intended
in
my
opinion
to
permit
this
court
or
any
reviewing
body
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
administrator
had
prior
to
1949
determined
whether
the
particular
establishment
in
question
was
nonretail
or
not.
now,
if
the
administrator
had
held
as
we
found
in
the
kentucky
finance
case
that
this
was
a
nonretail
establishment
because
they
determined
that
financial
institutions
of
that
kind
dealing
in
finance
were
not
considered
to
be
a
retail
establishment.
then
under
the
1949
amendment,
they
could
not
claim
to
be
a
retail
establishment
and
that's
what
was
established
in
my
opinion
in
the
retail,
in
the
kentucky
finance
case.
mr.
eli
a.
weston
yes,
all
of
the
sales
in
our
case
are
for
retail
and
none
of
them
we're
selling
for
resale.
mr.
eli
a.
weston
yes.
now,
we
met
that
requirement
because
we
--
all
of
the
witnesses
have
testified
on
what
we
are
recognized
in
the
industry
testified
if
all
of
our
sales
were
retail
sales.
mr.
eli
a.
weston
no.
now,
in
this
case,
actually,
i
believe
we
are
now
in
the
position
of
deciding
these
cases
on
a
case-by-case
basis
because
of
the
1949
amendment.
and
in
this
case,
there
was
no
determination
prior
to
1949.
in
this
type
of
an
establishment,
there
was
no
determination
that
we
were
nonretail
and
there
was
no
determination
that
we
were
retail.
and
the
reason
for
that,
if
the
court
please,
is
probably
because
this
particular
establishment
is
the
evolution
for
the
growing
up
of
the
old
time
tin
shop
which
we
found
either
in
the
seller
or
the
backroom
of
the
hardware
store.
these
establishments
feel
as
the
--
one
of
the
witnesses
said
the
hiatus
which
was
left
when
the
manufacturing
companies
decided
to
manufacture
the
tin
items
that
you
or
i
might
go
in
and
purchase
from
the
old
tin
shop
in
the
back
of
the
retail
hardware
store.
the
manufacturing
companies
deciding
to
furnish
those
items
to
the
hardware
store
had
left
the
hardware
store
going
one
way
and
the
old
style
of
tin
shop
going
the
other.
now,
the
testimony
in
this
case
shows
that
we
use
the
same
machines.
we
do
exactly
the
same
thing
as
we
did
in
the
tin
shop.
we
sell
these
items
at
retail.
a
man
comes
into
the
store
and
wants
his
spout.
the
woman
may
want
a
sides
of
the
dish
pan,
a
farmer
may
want
a
watering
trough
or
i
may
want
--
a
store,
may
want
something
in
the
instance
of
the
processing
companies
which
are
used
here
as
the
interstate
users.
our
cert
suggested
the
court
that
those
processing
companies
are
not
what
is
generally
termed
a
big
manufacturing
company,
processing
companies
as
the
court
will
take
judicial
notice
of.
i'll
assume
at
least
it's
in
the
record
that
the
processing
company
came
to
bury
after
our
establishment
was
setup.
and
contrary
to
what
the
government
would
suggest
in
the
brief,
the
processing
and
the
freezing
of
potatoes
is
not
what
you
might
term
a
substantial
type
of
manufacturing.
it's
a
simple
process
and
the
machinery
--
and
the
fabricating
materials
furnished
to
these
companies
were
first,
number
one,
furnished
during
the
down
period.
number
two,
there
were
items
which
would
consist
of
guards
where
the
motors
are,
and
ventilators
are,
and
one
of
these
statements
made
what
they
called
an
endless
belt
which
was
simply
a
leather
belt
with
pleats
on
it
which
would
carry
the
potatoes
along
until
they
are
sorted,
washed,
and
cooked,
and
frozen.
the
item
--
the
articles
of
the
--
the
testimony
shows
that
this
same
company
had
an
establishment
in
boise
which
was
a
180
miles
from
burley.
and
the
president
of
the
company
testified
that
in
the
boise
plant,
they
did
make
large
equipment
from
manufacturing
plants.
and
the
one
item
that
was
referred
to
here,
quite
often
by
the
government
in
their
brief
and
at
that
the
time
of
the
trial
was
a
vent
which
was
built
which
is
that
i
believe
seven
or
eight
feet
long
and
23
feet
high.
but
the
testimony
shows
that
that
was
vent
and
manufactured
at
the
boise
plant
which
was
a
different
type
of
operation
tariff.
mr.
eli
a.
weston
yes.
mr.
eli
a.
weston
i'm
sorry
justice
fortas,
i
cannot
give
anything
specific
by
way
of
the
records.
i
can
give
my
views
on
it
for
what
they
were.
it's
my
opinion
that
the
retail
concept
crept
into
this
thing
during
the
congressional
debates
and
at
which
time
i
think
senator
pepper
made
the
suggestion
that
it
had
--
it
could
have
a
retail
concept
in
the
sales
to
the
manufactures,
the
manufacturing
items
would
not
to
be
considered
retail
sales.
mr.
eli
a.
weston
it
we
would
not
have
the
retail
concept.
mr.
eli
a.
weston
it
would
take
away
the
retail
concept.
this
suggestion,
however,
by
senator
pepper
which
is
found
in
1950
congressional
record
was
refuted
by
senator
taft
as
i
recall
it
from
which
he
stated.
i
believe
senator
wherry
and
i
think
that
senator
pepper
asked
the
unanimous
consent
if
that
the
gist
of
what
is
a
retail
concept.
and
i
think
that
senator
wherry
objected
to
the
unanimous
consent
and
was
joined
in
i
believe
with
senator
taft
said
that
they
were
permitted
to
agree
with
the
record
but
not
if
it
was
to
be
used
by
the
administrator
in
determining
what
was
a
retail
concept.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
i
have
answered
your
question
or
not
but
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
1949
amendment,
in
effect,
said
to
the
secretary
the
retail
concept
is
to
be
determined
in
the
light
of
whether
or
not
these
are
sales
for
resale.
we're
not
interested
at
all
of
these
other
tests
that
you
have
applied
including
the
retail
concept.
from
now
on,
and
this
is
in
the
law,
this
is
not
a
question
in
which
the
administrator
can
interpret.
the
law
now
says
mr.
secretary,
“if
you
find
a
retail
establishment
that
does
not
sale
for
a
resale
and
if
you
find
a
retail
establishment
that
is
considered
as
retail
within
his
own
industry
then
we
think
that
it
has
the
retail
concept.”
and
that
is
it.
now,
that
is
my
opinion
of
what
the
1949
amendment
was
intended
to
do.
mr.
eli
a.
weston
yes.
mr.
eli
a.
weston
yes,
i
do.
mr.
eli
a.
weston
the
copies
--
the
reason
i
have
mentioned,
the
zachry
case
and
the
reason
why
i
have
mentioned
this
issue
which
is
actually
not
before
the
court
is
because
the
government
seems
to
take
into
position,
if
i
understand
their
brief,
that
where
we
have
an
establishment
that
has
been
considered
or
has
been
determined
to
be
in
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce
that
it
automatically
cannot
have
a
retail
establishment
exemption
and
i
believe
justice
harlan
in
the
kentucky
finance
case
or
in
the
roland
electric
case
made
the
statement
that
it
was
rare
not
impossible
for
the
establishment
to
be
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
on
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce
and
at
the
same
time
claim
the
retail
establishment
exemption.
and
i
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
opinion
was
written
before
the
1949
amendment.
it
is
written
before
the
amendment
which
required
the
original
law
provided
that
only
the
establishment
had
to
do
was
to
be
necessary
to
the
production
of
commerce
which
is
a
very
loose
termalmost
anything
could
be
necessary
for
the
production
of
the
items
for
commerce.
but
in
1949,
they
amended
the
law
of
the
state
that
it
must
be
closely
related
to
and
this
is
what
justice
frankfurter
seems
to
discuss
at
length
in
the
zachry
case
which
says
it
must
be
closely
related
to
the
production
of
goods
for
commerce,
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
in
this
case,
we
are
related
to
the
services
of
the
community.
we
are
related
in
furnishing
the
products
to
individual
purchasers
in
the
community,
the
farmer,
the
merchants,
and
the
individual
housewife.
we
were
set
up
for
that
purpose.
unfortunately,
the
processing
companies
came
in
after
we
were
established
and
we
did
furnish
them
some
materials.
but
i
still
think
it's
important
that
those
materials
according
to
the
record
are
furnished
when
the
plants
were
down.
they
were
furnished
on
an
emergency
basis
to
a
great
extent.
the
services
that
we
rendered
to
those
companies
could
have
been
performed
by
the
companies
themselves
and
as
one
witness
said,
they
are
very
frequently
were.
now,
the
question
that
arises,
how
closely
connected
are
we
to
a
potato
processing
company
under
those
circumstances?
we
feel
that
the
--
the
record
shows
that
we
were
not
closely
connected
to
or
directly
essential
to
the
operation
of
those
plants.
now,
that's
what
the
court
below
felt.
the
court
felt
we
were
set
up
to
serve
a
community
and
we
were
not
set
up
to
service
or
to
render
necessary
or
essential
machinery
to
a
processing
plant.
on
the
question
of
whether
we
are
a
retail
establishment
or
not,
i
would
like
to
just
briefly
go
over
the
evidence
of
the
president
of
the
company.
and
i'll
hit
it
just
very
briefly,
the
president
of
the
company
stated
that
he'd
been
in
the
tin
manu
--
the
tin
processing
business
for
many
years,
i
think
39
years.
he
testified
they
have
a
store
license.
he
testified
that
they
did
the
manufacturing
in
boise
not
in
burley.
he
testified
that
the
services
are
rendered
as
an
emergency.
he
testified
that
the
same
machinery
is
used
in
his
tin
shop,
now
it
was
used
39
years
ago
and
in
fact
one
of
the
same
machines
preferably
is
in
the
present
shop.
he
testified
that
the
number
of
sales
to
the
individuals
were
greater
than
the
sales
being
numbered
to
the
processing
companies.
he
testified
that
they
have
a
stock
on
the
shelves
that
you
could
in
the
place
of
business
to
see
what
you
want
to
buy
is
right
there
in
displaying
on
the
shelves.
that
they
were
considered
retail
within
the
industry
and
someone
asked
whether
--
the
government
attorney
asked
if
he
had
any
counters,
and
he
said
“yes,
we
have
six
counters.”
he
said,
“if
you
come
in
to
our
establishment
and
you
see
something
on
the
place
that
you
want
and
made
in
to
a
particular
item,
a
custom-built
item,
we
have
six
tables
and
we
have
six
salesmen
and
they
can
tell
you
or
ask
you
what
you
want,
you
can
tell
them
what
it
was
and
they'll
build
it
for
you
and
sell
it
to
you
at
retail.”
he
compared
it
to
a
woman
going
into
a
store
and
buying
a
bowl
of
cloth.
he
testified
that
they
were
a
retail
custom
shop
and
under
their
sales
for
--
were
for
retail.
and
he
testified
as
to
the
types
of
customers
and
i
haven't
much
time
where
i
would
read
that
these
customers
are
variety
of
farmers
and
ranchers
and
housewives
and
grocery
stores
and
other
stores.
mr.
eli
a.
weston
he
had
--
his
occupation
or
in
his
establishment
or
similarly
some
respect
to
the
processes,
it
was
seasonal.
he
testified
that
he
only
had
what
he
considered
two
or
three
employees
the
year
round
what
he
called
regular.
now,
during
the
down
season
and
when
these
processes
barely
need
some
extra
work
then
he
has
a
crew
augmented
i
think
to
at
highest
17
or
18.
but
the
president's
testimony
which
is
undisputed
of
course
was
that
he
was
to
some
extent
a
seasonal
operator
himself.
mr.
eli
a.
weston
i
think
it's
about
8,000.
before
my
time
is
up,
i
would
like
to
comment
just
briefly
on
the
testimony
of
mr.
coffin.
mr.
coffin
is
the
secretary
and
the
attorney
for
the
company.
he's
a
retired
attorney.
but
he
very
vividly
pointed
out
why
he
considered
this
retail
establishment
and
he
suggested
even
he
was
a
boy
of
13
that
his
father
had
a
hardware
store
and
that
he
very
often
visited
the
tin
shop
because
he
was
intrigued
by
the
way
the
tin
shop
operated.
and
this
witness
who
again
had
been
familiar
with
the
industry
for
35
or
40
years
testified
that
the
establishment
in
question
here
was
simply
the
evolution
or
the
filling
in
of
the
gap
between
the
old
time
tin
shop
and
the
present
custom
metal
shop.
in
other
words,
he
testified
that
the
customers
were
the
same.
the
articles
that
were
molded
and
made
were
the
same.
and
the
only
difference
was
that
there
were
larger
customers
and
they
were
using
perhaps
a
different
metal
than
they
did
in
the
old
tin
shop
days.
and
he
also
testified
that
there's
no
place
else,
if
the
court
please,
and
i
think
this
is
important.
there
was
no
place
else
where
an
individual
customer
could
go
and
get
this
particular
item
except
of
this
type
of
an
establishment.
now,
the
testimony
was
a
reference
to
other,
we
were
considered
a
retail
establishment
and
then
the
industry
was
furnished
to
us
by
salesmen,
both
wholesale
salesmen
and
manufacturing
salesmen
who
testified
without
contradiction
that
we
are
at
the
end
of
the
line,
that
we
were
considered
the
retailer
in
the
industry,
that
all
of
the
others
up
from
us
were
considered
wholesalers
or
manufacturers.
the
testimony
of
the
professor
was
very
interesting
but
on
cross-examination,
the
--
practically
every
point
made
by
the
professor
could
be
eliminated
by
the
1949
amendment.
for
example,
he
stressed
the
size
of
the
sale.
he
stressed
the
price
of
the
sale.
i
think
he
stressed
the
fact
that
it
was
the
--
it
went
back
to
the
old
business
use
test
which
in
our
opinion
was
definitely
eliminated
by
the
1949
amendment.
thank
you.
