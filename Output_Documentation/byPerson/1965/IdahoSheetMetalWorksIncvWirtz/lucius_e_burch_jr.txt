mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
the
problem
that
is
brought
before
the
court
by
the
issuance
of
its
writ
is
not
as
broad
as
the
court
might
gather
from
the
argument
of
my
friend.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
problem
before
the
court
is
composed
of
two
ingredients;
one
being
no
more
than
12
words
of
the
statute,
and
the
other,
a
conclusion
of
fact
made
by
the
district
court
that
could
cut
in
by
the
unanimous
circuit
of
the
sixth
circuit.
the
12
words
of
the
statute
are
these,
and
i
will
read
it
and
the
court
will
perceive
that
the
statute
contains
no
words
of
art,
it
contains
nothing
that
is
obscure,
it
contains
nothing
that
requires
anything
except
reading,
“is
not
for
resale
and
it
is
recognized
as
retail
sales
or
services
in
the
particular
industry”.
that
is
what
the
congress
said
that
to
me
is
clear.
and
unless
area
something
obscure,
unclear
or
ambiguous,
i
know
of
no
basis
for
leaping
behind
the
statute
into
the
frequently
cloudy
language
of
congressional
debate
to
see
what
it
means.
now,
as
to
the
facts,
the
facts
i
won't
state
them
because
it's
tedious
and
it's
unnecessary
because
i
have
the
language
of
chief
judge
white.
in
our
opinion,
this
was
the
only
conclusion
the
court
could
properly
reach
from
the
overwhelming
evidence
in
this
case.
now,
the
question
that
immediately
occurs
to
the
court
is
that
clearly
erroneous.
i
don't
have
to
argue
that
because
my
friend
here
in
a
very
able
brief
on
page
20
concedes.
we
do
not
dispute
the
finding
that
the
word
‘retail'
has
been
used
in
the
industry
most
often
to
label
all
sales
not
for
retail.
so
what
else
is
there
to
the
case?
a
clear
statute,
any
finding
of
fact
concurred
in
by
the
appellate
court.
now,
it
probably
would
be
the
better
part
of
advocacy
for
me
to
sit
down
now
and
go
out
and
get
a
proper
lunch
and
then
go
home.
but
i'm
not.
i'm
going
to
follow
my
friend
through
this
rather
tedious
maze
of
legislative
history.
and
i
do
it
constant
that
i
am
not
distracting
the
court
from
the
virtues
of
a
solid
point.
and
i
know
that
the
conclusion
which
i'm
going
to
reach
sustains
the
position
that
i
take.
this
all
started
back
in
1949
on
august
30th
when
senator
holland
introduced
his
amendment.
it's
quite
an
interesting
speech.
it
has
a
good
deal
to
do
with
mr.
justice
black,
then
senator
black's
remarks
when
the
original
bill
was
introduced
in
1937.
this
is
what
senator
holland
said
that
they
were
trying
to
accomplish
by
the
legislation.
mr.
president
that
that
arose
because
the
administrator
in
the
courts
including
the
united
states
supreme
court
rule
that
the
sales
of
goods
and
service
for
business
use
is
distinguished
from
family
or
household
use
was
not
retail.
i
cite
at
several
cases
and
i
should
read
into
the
record
at
this
time
though
i
do
not
propose
to
worry
in
the
senate
by
quoting
the
same,
roland
electric
company,
boutell
against
walling
and
mccomb
against
diebert.
and
then
he
puts
out
--
sets
out
examples
of
what
it
means.
these
rulings
on
a
few
decisions
which
have
been
based
upon
them
together
with
the
most
strained
rulings
had
resulted
from
these
decisions
have
brought
about
the
present
situation
which
i
think
compels
the
congress
to
pass
clarifying
legislation.
now,
what
did
they
intend
to
do?
the
area
is
one
sentence
in
the
conference
report.
under
this
test,
any
sale
or
service
regardless
of
the
type
of
customer
will
have
to
be
treated
by
the
administrator
and
courts
as
a
retail
sale
or
service
so
long
as
such
sale
or
service
is
recognized
in
the
particular
industry
as
a
retail
sale
or
service.
well
now,
where
do
we
get
this
cloudiness
that
comes
from
my
adversary's
brief?
she
brings
it
in
commencing
on
--
in
her
brief
at
the
bottom
of
page
33
in
which
she
quotes
from
a
report
that
was
brought
in
to
the
congressional
record
by
senator
pepper.
i
will
go
into
that
for
a
minute
not
because
i
think
it's
important
but
because
she
lays
great
stress
on
it
and
it
is
somewhat
more
interesting
that
many
questions
of
this
type
are.
senator
pepper
sought
unanimous
consent
to
put
it
in
to
the
record
and
they
let
him
put
it
in
the
record,
they
granted
him
unanimous
consent
because
senator
pepper
had
stated
that
it
had
been
concurred
in
by
all
the
conferees.
then
somebody
got
the
idea
that
senator
pepper
was
not
as
careful
with
his
facts
as
he
should
have
been.
so
they
began
to
query
among
the
floor
of
the
senate.
he
then
was
able
to
remember
that
mr.
shroyer
who
was
mr.
taft's
representative
had
not
concurred
in
it
and
that
the
other
senator,
i
believe,
mr.
donnell,
had
not
concurred
in
it
whereupon
mr.
wherry
rose
and
said,
“mr.
president
i
ask
unanimous
consent
that
that
part
of
the
action
which
the
senate
took
in
granting
unanimous
consent
to
the
senator
from
florida
to
instate
the
statement
in
the
record
along
with
the
conference
report
be
rescinded.
so
that
the
senators
may
be
given
ample
time
to
study
the
statement.
overnight
is
sufficient
time
for
me.
then,
if
the
senator
will
renew
his
request
after
members
of
the
committee
on
labor
and
public
welfare,
they
have
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
it.
i
think
there
will
be
no
problem
at
all.
mr.
pepper
very
well
just
rescinded.”
then
senator
pepper
comes
in
again
with
the
statement
that
my
friend
see
--
sets
up
as
the
touchstone
of
the
argument
about
this
retail
concept
in
re-establishing
roland
and
he
now
comes
back,
senator
pepper,
“now,
i
read
often
the
state
not
on
behalf
of
all
of
the
conferees
because
two
of
the
conferees
would
speak
for
themselves
if
they
care
to
do
so
or
through
their
representatives
and
through
their
chosen
spokesman.
let
it
be
clearly
understood
that
the
statement
only
expresses
the
views
of
the
named
three
senators
as
to
what
the
meaning
of
the
language
adopted
by
it
and
by
the
congress.”
i
say
that
it's
not
only
because
the
record
contains
no
statement
on
behalf
of
the
senate
conferees
whereas
the
house
conferees
submitted
a
rather
lengthy
statement
on
the
part
of
the
house
members.
and
now
here's
the
way
it
got
in
the
record.
mr.
wherry
rose
--
mr.
pepper
sought
to
interrupt
him,
“mr.
wherry,
just
a
moment.
i
have
not
finished,
let
me
conclude.
i
do
not
want
to
grant
unanimous
consent
if
the
statement
is
offered
by
any
other
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
senate
conferees,
or
with
the
idea
that
it
is
to
be
a
guide
for
those
who
may
later
interpret
the
act.
if
it
is
offered
on
the
basis
of
being
merely
a
statement
by
individual
senators,
i
shall
not
object.”
and
that's
how
it
got
in
the
record.
senator
taft's
comment,
“i
won't
worry
the
court
with
it.”
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
i
believe
it's
33
at
the
bottom.
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
senator?
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
the
--
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
i
believe
it's
--
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
i'm
ashamed
to
say
i
haven't
got
the
brief.
before
me
is
a
not
that
i
made.
but
i've
believe
it
was
33,
if
your
honor
please.
it
is
--
it
refers
to
the
senate
conference
report
which
is
in
these
words,
this
p,
p
as
in
page
14877
of
the
congressional
record.
the
conference
agreed
for
the
exemption
of
establishments
which
it's
traditional
regarded
as
retail,
establishments
which
are
not
ordinarily
available
to
general
consuming
public
such
affiliates
conceded
in
boutell
against
walling
and
the
establishments
which
do
not
have
the
exemption
because
the
selling
of
services
which
they
are
engaged
in
is
not
considered
to
be
retail
such
as
banks,
insurance
companies,
credit
companies,
newspapers,
telephone
companies,
gas,
utility
companies,
telegraph
companies,
et
cetera,
will
not
become
retail
or
service
establishments
under
the
provisions
of
the
conference
agreement
nor
does
the
conference
agreement
change
the
status
or
change
the
warehouses
or
central
offices
such
as
those
held
nonexempt
in
philips
against
walling.
all
of
the
establishments
selling
industrial
goods
and
services
that
manufacturers
engaged
in
the
production
of
goods
for
interstate
commerce
of
the
industrial
and
business
customers,
such
as
the
establishment
held
nonexempt
in
roland
electric
company
against
walling.
that
is
the
section
that
came
in,
in
the
way
in
which
i
have
--
it
is
33,
if
your
honor
please,
i
know
this
is
correct.
95
congressional
record,
14877
statement
of
the
majority
of
senate
conferees,
it's
the
last
thing
at
the
bottom
and
that
is
what
is
being
referred
to
in
the
remarks
for
senator
wherry
that
i
referred
to
--
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
the
house
committee,
i
believe,
if
your
honor
please
is
losinski,
i
believe
is
--
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
so,
if
your
honors
please,
there
is
no
legislative
pieces
for
that
even
if
the
statute
was
ambiguous
which
is
not.
now,
i
come
to
part
of
the
argument
which
he
makes
to
which
i
have
a
somewhat
visual
reaction
and
this
she
refers
to,
i
say,
she,
my
friendly
solicitor
and
this
--
she
had
written
an
expert
brief
and
made
a
good
argument
and
i've
heard
this
argument
two
courts
before
so
i'm
not
unfair
for
it.
but
she
characterized,
is
this
out
of
lewis—carol
page
21
of
the
brief,
businessmen
are
no
less
entitled
in
humpty
dumpty
to
make
words
mean
what
they
want
them
to
mean.
and
if
the
statute
was
intended
to
turn
solely
on
word
usage,
there's
no
reason
why
they
should
not
take
advantage
of
it
and
adopt
whatever
usage
entitles
them
to
profit
benefit.
and
if
that
is
so,
the
statute
is
reduced
to
the
absurdity
of
saying
that
every
industry
selling
goods
not
for
resale
shall
pay
minimum
wages,
but
if
not,
would
only
if
the
industry
is
willing.
now,
judge
white
answered
that
by
saying,
“these
habits
and
practices
in
the
tire
industry
were
not
of
recent
origin
nor
were
they
adopted
to
avoid
the
provisions
of
the
act
but
what
traditional
and
had
existed
for
many
years
before
the
amendment
was
enacted.
the
same
concept
of
retail
in
this
industry
was
adopted
by
the
industry
and
it's
shown
by
the
record
back
in
the
early
30s
at
which
time
under
the
authority
of
the
congress
the
nra
code
was
drawn.
and
that
definition
continued
until
this
court
shut
on
the
blue
eagle
in
the
schechter
case.
then
the
same
definition
was
adopted
in
the
industry
and
was
in
the
opa
code,
continued
in
the
opa
code
as
long
as
the
opa
was
alive.
and
it
is
the
concept
adopted
not
only
in
the
state
of
tennessee
but
if
my
memory
is
correct
in
33
others
states
that
all
the
plan
of
retail
just
exactly
the
way
it
has
been
defined
in
this
industry.
so
there
is
not
the
slightest
basis
in
this
record,
not
one
word
that
indicates
that
this
definition
was
adopted
for
the
purposes
of
this
litigation
or
any
litigation.
but
the
plain
--
the
inference
is
that
the
people
who
pass
this
legislation
knew
what
had
been
the
traditional
accepted
concept
of
retail
in
the
industry
at
the
time
the
legislation
was
passed.
now,
one
word
about
--
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
i
was
just
about
to
say
effective
from
(voice
overlap)
please
and
i
do
not
disagree
with
kentucky
finance.here
is
what
the
kentucky
finance
held.
it
held
first
that
the
1949
amendment
was
passed
to
get
away
from
the
dicta
in
roland.
and
it
said
that
the
finance
industry
was
not
included
within
the
retail
exemption
for
two
reasons.
first
that
you
do
not
resell
finance,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
resale
of
your
borrowings.
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
no
sir.
i
mentioned
it
but
i
would
say
that
that's
the
main
point
of
case
and
that
prior
to
the
1949
amendment
that
there
had
been
no
concept
of
retail
selling
in
the
industry.
that
is
what
i've
introduced
with
kentucky
finance
--
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
no,
if
your
honor
please,
i
would
not.
my
answer
to
the
court's
question
is
first,
that
if
the
industry
has
a
definition
which
preexisted
the
mitigation
that
the
court
is
bound
to
accept
the
definition
of
the
industry.
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
it
answers
it
and
then
i
wished
to
answer
it
further
by
saying
that
if
the
test
was
as
the
solicitor
suggests
that
you
have
to
show
a
historical
retail
concept
but
the
proof
is
in
this
case
that
it
did
exist.
and
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
adjudication
of
both
courts.
i
find
nothing
--
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
yes,
i
do,
if
your
honor
please.
under
the
facts
in
this
case,
that
the
sole
criteria
is
whether
or
not
it
is
for
resale.
if
it
is
not
for
resale,
it
is
retail.
that
is
the
definition
of
the
industry,
that
was
the
definition
of
the
sales
tax,
that
had
been
the
definition
of
the
opa
--
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
run
that
at
me
again
because
i'm
not
quite
--
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
it
is
not
for
resale
and
the
industry
does
not
treat
it
as
retail.
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
i
know
of
nothing
in
this
record
that
fits
that
category
but
i
would
say
that
it
was
not
retail.
i
would
say
--
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
no
sir.
it
would
not
be
under
the
exemption
but
again,
i
say
under
this
--
under
this
record,
i
know
of
nothing
that
comes
in
that
category.
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
oh
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
easily
conceivable.
now,
applying
the
doctrine
of
common
sense
which
is
something
else
again
that
i
don't
think
i'm
forced
to
do
anymore
than
the
question
of
legislative
history
but
the
way
they
presented
this
case
if
it
is
not
for
personal
use
and
consumption,
it
is
not
retail.
if
it
something
that
you
buy,
do
use
in
connection
with
your
business,
it
is
not
retail.
you
take
a
young
college
professor
that
goes
into
the
bookstore.
he
buys
something
of
high
promise
to
inform
himself
to
lecture
his
economics
class
the
next
day.
that
to
them
is
not
retail.
on
the
same,
it
goes
in
--
in
the
same
day,
it
is
read
in
the
--
in
the
paper
that
the
court
has
read
fannie
hill
and
the
next
time
he
goes
in
he
may
have
to
get
it
under
the
table
instead
and
he
finds
that
to
take
home
and
edify
himself
with,
that's
retail.
same
transaction
made
by
the
same
clerk
in
the
same
store.
it's
a
perfectly
nonsensical
classification.
now,
any
classification
must
be
sufficiently
objective
for
an
administrator
to
have
something
other
than
what
is
in
his
head
or
what
is
in
the
head
of
the
user
to
regulate
the
sale.
now,
the
congress
has
said
if
the
industry
has
classified
it,
we
can
find
out
what
the
industry
has
done
because
if
senator
taft
said
in
the
course
of
the
debate,
"what
is
retail
in
any
particular
industry
as
a
question
of
fact
that
has
been
settled
for
many
years."
we
respectfully
submit
that
on
all
bases,
on
the
limited
basis
which
this
case
comes
before
the
court
what
the
clear
statute
and
with
the
finding
of
fact
that
is
not
clearly
erroneous
that
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
but
if
it
were
not
that
way,
if
there
were
some
doubt
as
to
what
the
statute
were,
what
it
meant,
that
the
legislative
history
clearly
shows
that
transactions
of
this
type
were
intended
to
be
exempt.
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
oh,
that's
designedly,
if
your
honor
please,
a
hard
question.
in
my
opinion
it
would
but
i'd
say
i
know
of
no
circumstance
where
anything
like
that
exists.
one
of
the
criteria
that
were
mentioned
by
the
congress,
one
of
these
discussions
was
that
to
be
a
retail
establishment,
the
establishment
must
be
available
to
the
general
public.
now,
this
establishment
is
available
to
the
general
public,
it
is
widely
patronized
by
the
general
public.
anybody
can
go
in
there
and
buy
tire.
it
is
full
of
people
going
in
there
to
get
tires.
people
go
in
there
and
buy
one
tire,
two
tires,
four
tires.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
shows
this
to
be
other
than
a
progressive
prosperous,
active
place
that
sells
tires
to
the
general
public.
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
no.
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
all
one
place.
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
yes
sir.
we
have
price
differentials.
some
people
buy,
if
they
buy
large
quality,
they
buy
for
less
than
they
would
charge
me
if
i
went
in
to
buy
a
tire.
and
that
was
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
arguments
that
has
been
made
by
my
friend,
made
below
and
made
in
our
brief
here
that
if
you
get
a
price
discount
that
it
can't
be
--
it
can't
be
retail.
of
course,
that's
not
what
the
congress
said
and
again
you
could
see
what
happens.
if
i
go
in
and
buy
a
cartoon
of
cigarettes
and
get
them
at
a
lower
price
than
if
i
bought
one
pack
of
cigarettes
under
that
definition
it
would
not
be
on
retail
sale.
i'm
quite
sure
that
that
was
never
what
the
congress
intended.
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
it
would
depend,
if
your
honor,
please
on
the
quantity.
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
if
they
both
bought
one,
they
both
pay
the
same.
mr.
lucius
e.
burch,
jr.
yes
sir.
but
if
the
big
trucking
company
had
bought
20,
he
might
get
it
cheaper
than
the
man
who
bought
one.
