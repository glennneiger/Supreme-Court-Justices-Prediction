ms.
bessie
margolin
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
this
case
also
presents
the
question
of
the
application
of
the
retail
and
service
establishment
exemption
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
and
it
raises
the
question
with
respect
to
a
business
of
a
tire
dealer
and
retailer,
a
large
tire
dealer
and
retailer
engaged
very
substantially
in
selling
and
servicing
tires
to
commercial
trucking
companies,
construction
contractors
and
other
industrial
companies
operating
fleets
of
trucks
or
commercial
vehicles.
it
admitted
that
over
--
over
half
of
the
daily
volume
of
business
of
the
roland
--
of
the
steepleton
company
is
derived
from
the
servicing
--
selling
and
servicing
of
tires
or
commercial
customers
of
this
type.
this
type
--
this
business,
of
course,
differs
from
the
one
in
the
idaho
sheet
metal
company
in
the
sense
that
this
business
was
not
expressly
and
specifically
by
name
mentioned
in
the
legislative
reports
and
debates
and
it
wasn't
expressly
stated
like
it
was
as
to
street
credit
companies
and
the
servicing
manufacturing
equipment
that
those
activities
would
remain
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
exemption.
but
our
position
is
that
the
same
principles
must
necessarily
apply
in
determining
what
is
recognized
in
a
particular
industry
as
retail.
that
otherwise
that
phrase
in
the
1949
amendments
becomes
meaningless
as
we
think
is
very
well
demonstrated
by
the
record
in
this
particular
case.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
below
recognized
and
stated
that
this
business,
steepleton's
business,
would
not
be
exempt
prior
to
the
1949
amendment.
the
court
put
it
on
the
basis
that
across
these
commercial
sales
were
for
business
use
and
that
would
have
disqualified
it
from
the
exemption.
the
court
then
went
on
to
say
that
the
repudiation
of
the
business
use
test
changed
that
and
changed
that
in
such
a
way
that
now,
any
and
all
sales,
any
and
all
sales,
to
commercial
users
could
now
qualify
as
retail.
our
position
is
particularly
on
basis
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
if
any
in
all
commercial
sales
can
be
classified
as
retail
simply
by
reference
to
word
usage
in
the
industry
then
the
clause
recognized
in
the
particular
industry
as
retail
is
wholly
meaningless
and
self-defeating
because
any
--
any
industry
can
adopt
the
same
type
of
definition.
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
definition
in
relation
to
the
statutory
language,
you
will
see
that
the
definition,
“all
sales
not
to
resale
are
retail”
which
is
the
definition
which
was
held
attended
to
the
exemption
here.
it
was
in
effect
putting
a
period
after
being
phrase,
the
first
phrase
in
that
clause
"not
for
resale"
and
just
eliminating
the
industry
recognition
language.
now,
this
sweeping
definition,
of
course,
is
very
simple
and
easy
for
any
not
too
unsophisticated
businessman
to
adopt
and
they
could
bring
in
the
same
type
of
the
evidence
that
they
brought
in
here
to
prove
that
this
was
traditionally
a
--
used
as
a
definition
of
retail
in
the
industry.
now,
the
--
in
effect
then,
the
court
below
held
that
the
industry's
word
usage
evidence,
a
mere
showing
of
the
industries
word
usage
that
everything
not
for
resale
is
retail
is
sufficient
to
meet
the
condition
of
the
statute.
that
that's
purely
a
factual
question
the
court
has
only
to
inquire
what
is
the
definition
in
the
industry
and
there
are
no
standards,
no
concepts
and
no
legal
question
to
determine
at
all.
it
affirmed
the
district
court
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
substantial
evidence
to
support
its
findings
of
fact
that
the
industry
recognized
this
definition
of
retail.
now,
i
think
it
will
help
some
to
see
what
the
industry
included
in
this
definition.alright
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
what
i
hope
to
direct
myself
to,
primarily,
mr.
justice
harlan.
but
i
think
to
understand
--
to
get
the
legal
principles
and
prospective,
i
think
we
should
look
at
some
of
the
sales
which
the
industry
representatives,
witnesses
testified
were
retail
sales
in
their
book.
now,
they
--
there's
a
big
record
here.
i
don't
think
there's
too
much
except
certainly
by
the
industry
representatives,
the
witnesses.
it's
a
cumulative
repetition
that
regardless
of
any
other
consideration
or
factor,
they
had
always
used
the
word
retail
to
mean
sales
not
for
resale
and
in
the
--
they
didn't
give
--
they
were
reluctant
to
state
what
purposes
they
use
that
definition
for
but
as
i
shall
point
out
later,
the
only
explanation
they
gave
was
that
was
the
state
sales
tax
definition.
and
as
i
shall
point
out
later
that
state
sales
tax
definition
clearly
has
no
fresh,
no
relationship
or
relevance
to
any
statutory
purpose
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
now,
the
--
after
adopting
this
--
of
course,
it
is
the
broadest
conceivable
definition
they
could
adopt.
and
the
witness,
marsh,
who
was
the
executive
director
of
the
tire
dealers
association
testified
at
length
not
only
about
what
he
regarded
as
retail
sales
but
also
testified
at
length
to
show
that
the
industry
did
make
a
definite
distinction
between
ordinary
retail
passenger
car
sales
and
commercial
sales.
and
that
they
have
a
generally
recognized
system
of
discounts
of
the
commercial
sales
that
were
quite
different
from
those
passenger
car
sales,
that
they
had
different
commercial
salesmen
and
they
handled
these
sales
in
quite
different
ways.
they
had
sales
--
special
commercial
salesman
who
went
out
and
solicited
the
business
from
the
common
carriers
and
the
big
construction
companies.
they
sent
special
workmen
out
to
work
at
the
terminals
of
these
transportation
companies
who
were
their
big
customer.
and
they
had
people
continuously
servicing,
and
repairing,
and
maintaining
their
tires
for
continuous
operation
of
their
trucks
and
vehicles
in
interstate
commerce.
but
all
of
these,
though
that
the
industry
witnesses
said,
was
wholly
irrelevant
to
their
definition
of
retail.
the
witness
marsh
testified
that
the
sales
of
tires
specially
fitted
for
use
on
heavy
commercial
equipment
even
if
sold
in
quantities
of
a
thousand
unit
lots
at
a
30%
discount
off
the
commercial
pricelist
would
be
as
much
a
retail
sale
as
sale
of
four-passenger
car
tires
to
an
individual
at
the
least
price
without
a
discount.
and
the
same
witness
testified
that
the
purchasers
stopped
of
a
whole
stock
of
earth
moving
tires
for
heavy
construction
equipment
for
use
on
a
big
contracting
job
would
be
a
retail
sale
or
the
sale
of
$25,000
at
a
time
to
a
common
carrier
fleet
operator
would
be
a
retail
sale.
another
industry
trade
association
official
testified
that
not
only
that
quantity
sales
at
50
to
a
100
are
more
of
a
commercial
--
to
commercial
fleet
operators
for
retail
sales
but
that
the
sale
of
specialized
three
trailer
jet
airplane
tires
to
commercial
airlines
was
a
retail
sale
in
his
book
notwithstanding
his
description
that
this
business
was
highly
specialized
big
business.
respondent
steepleton
himself
testified
that
the
sale
that
as
many
of
--
50
to
a
100
of
the
largest
size
truck
tire
designed
to
hold
anywhere
from
20,000
to
30,000
pounds
payload
and
used
only
on
the
over
the
--
over
the
road
truck
to
trailer
transports
to
a
customer
like
garden
transport,
another
common
carrier
of,
one
of
the
largest
customers
southwestern
transportation
company
that
that
sale
was
also
a
resale
--
retail
in
his
book.
now,
the
basis
on
which
the
explanation
or
the
purpose
for
such
a
classification,
the
witnesses
insisted
was
wholly
irrelevant.
it
came
out
though
in
their
cross-examination
and
came
out
very
clearly
that
the
only
purpose,
the
only
explanation
for
any
such
definition
as
this
--
was
that
they
have
to
pay
the
state
sales
tax.
and
that
naturally
they
kept
records
designating
sales
that
they
have
to
pay
the
sales
tax
on
as
consumer
or
retail
sales.
and
some
of
the
witnesses
testified
they
didn't
use
the
word
retail,
they
used
the
word
consumer.
the
five
witnesses
said
that
they
hadn't
used
the
word
retail
to
describe
any
sizeable
commercial
sale
in
ten
years.
marsh
when
he
explained
why
he
would
classify
earthmover
tires,
a
sale
of
--
a
lot
of
earthmover
tires
as
retail
said,
“well,
if
that
sale
occurred
in
ohio,
he
would
have
to
pay
sales
tax
on
it.”
and
steepleton
himself
said
that
this
definition
--
this
definition
which
he
said
the
industry
recognized
was
exactly
like
the
one
in
the
tennessee
state
sales
tax.
the
point
i'm
making
is
if
the
state
sales
tax
or
if
the
industry
is
simply
saying
that
they
adopt,
they
follow
the
state
sales
tax
definition
of
retail.
if
that
is
to
be
determinative
of
the
application
of
this
condition
of
the
exemption,
then
we
just
as
well
read
the
exemption
of
how
the
act
is
meaningless.
in
the
first
place,
the
state
--
the
state
sales
tax
has
no
relation
to
any
particular
industry
so
that
it's
really
contrary
to
the
--
it's
directly
contrary
to
even
the
language,
the
statutory
language
to
say
that
the
state
sales
tax
definition
is
the
one
to
be
applied.
that's
a
general
state
definition.
it
is
certainly
not
a
definition
of
any
particular
industry.
it's
general
for
every
industry.
and
presumably,
i
feel
quite
sure
that
every
industry
keeps
the
type
of
records
which
these
witnesses
in
this
case,
the
industry
witnesses
produced
in
abundance.
we
have
a
mass
of
exhibits
on
file
here
in
the
court,
a
mass
of
documents
which
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
read
and
i
don't
think
we
find
very
interesting.
but
what
they
are
since
the
whole
mass
of
documents
is
just
a
document
showing
that
they
classified
the
sales
as
consumer,
a
dealer,
a
retail
sales,
and
for
all
and
it's
pretty
clearly
from
these
documents
that
this
was
done
solely
for
sales
tax
purposes.
now,
that
type
of
document
could
be
produced
in
any
industry,
i
assume.
i
assume
some
kind
of
record
is
kept
in
the
payment
of
state
sales
taxes.
so
i
think
we
can
count
on,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
a
practical
matter,
this
definition
has
become
very
popular
generally
in
most
every
industry
that
we
bring
an
action
against
now
that
claims
the
exemption
comes
in
with
the
same
definition.
now,
we
say
that
to
read
the
statute
is
permitting
that
thought
of
word
usage
and
just
turning
merely
on
word
usage
without
any
legal
standards
or
any
concepts
to
read
the
statute
that
way
as
to
deprive
it
of
any
rational
content
and
to
make
it
depend
solely
on
the
will
of
the
industry
representatives
themselves.
nothing
was
more
vehemently
denied
in
the
debates
of
the
sponsors
then
that
this
was
the
intent
of
congress.
senator
holland
repeatedly
disavowed
any
such
intent
to
permit
the
industry
members
themselves
to
determine
what
should
be
regarded
as
retail
sales,
the
purposes
of
the
exemption.
ms.
bessie
margolin
it
uses
the
word
retail.
justice
fortas,
most
of
the
sales
tax
statutes
do
use
that
word.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
might
point
out
that
our
witness
--
our
expert
witness
and
it's
--
this
becomes
the
battle
of
the
experts
too
when
we
get
into
a
question
of
what
the
industry,
how
it
labeled
it
and
why.
our
expert
witness
said
who
is
an
expert
witness
on
state
sale
taxes
and
in
fact
was
retained
to
rewrite
the
tennessee
sales
tax.
but
he
said,
they
decided
not
to
rewrite
it
because
there's
more
revenue
the
way
they
had
it
written.
and
he
said
that
nobody
that
he
knew
of
would
ever
argue,
of
course,
it
was
argued
in
this
case.
he
didn't
think
anyone
would
argue
suppose
he
was
referring
to
marketing
experts
and
economist.
anyone
would
argue
that
the
state
sales
taxes
are
limited
exclusively
to
retail
sale.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
maybe
--
i
think
it
is
quoted
in
the
record
somewhere.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
we
--
did
we
quote
it
in
our
supreme
court
brief?
i
know
we
had
it
in
our
court
of
appeals
brief
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
that
the
definition
is
any
transfer
of
title
or
possession
or
both
exchanged
in
any
manner
by
any
means
whatsoever
of
tangible
personal
property
for
consideration.
and
defined
sale
at
retail
is
a
sale
to
a
consumer
to
any
person
for
any
purpose
other
than
resale.
ms.
bessie
margolin
this
is
and
i
don't
know
whether
we
put
it
in
our
supreme
court
brief.
we
took
the
rule
more
of
general
approach
in
the
supreme
court
brief
and
did
not
emphasize
the
tax
statutes
the
way
we
did
in
the
court
of
appeals
without
rebuttal
right
over
down
there.
ms.
bessie
margolin
we
have
felt
that
the
fact
that
this
--
the
only
explanation
for
this
definition
was
that
the
state
sales
tax
though
is
conclusive
evidence
that
this
is
a
wholly
meaningless
definition.
of
course
any
acceptance
of
mere
word
usage,
we
think,
would
be
irrational
in
this
context
but
we
think
it's
particularly
well
demonstrated
here
by
the
fact
that
they
resorted
to
the
word
‘usage'
in
the
state
sales
tax
which
has
absolutely
no
relevance
or
meaning
in
the
context
of
this
statute.
now,
we
say
and
to
get
any
rational
meaning
or
to
give
a
rational
meaning
to
this
clause
of
exemption
and
we
realized
it's
a
troublesome
clause
and
understand
that
on
the
face
of
it,
it
does
appear
to
simply
leave
it
to
the
recognition
of
particular
industry.
we
think
it's
clear
though
that
the
recognition
need
not
to
be
interpreted
as
definition
of
word
‘usage'
that
recognition
in
the
particular
industry
has
to
be
judged
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
intent
just
as
every
other
phrase
in
the
statute
must
be
judged.
and
that
there
is
ample
evidence
in
the
legislative
debates
and
reports
to
support
a
rational
interpretation
which
would
provide
some
legal
standards
in
determining
which,
if
any,
of
these
commercial
sales
are
recognized
as
retail,
are
treated
as
a
retail
or
of
such
a
nature
as
to
be
eligible
to
be
recognize
as
retail.
and
we
think
that
in
the
kentucky
finance
case,
this
court
limited
the
very
--
carefully
pointed
out
the
limited
effect
of
the
1949
amendment
that
it
was
to
eliminate
the
business
use
tests
in
the
sense
that
that
was
the
sole
criterion
that
was
--
that
the
congress
thought
have
been
previously
used,
that
sales
had
been
held
not
retail
solely
on
the
basis
that
they
were
for
business
use.
now,
i
think
congress
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
they
didn't
intend
to
eliminate
--
to
eliminate
all
business
use
sales
from
classification
as
the
nonretail.
the
specific
examples
it
gave
make
it
quite
clear
that
it
did
not
intend.
and
that
in
these
two
areas
that
are
applicable
to
this
case,
in
at
least
two
areas
are
applicable
to
this
case,
congress
intended
the
court
to
make
a
--
to
reach
a
legal
conclusion.
the
first
area,
we
think,
is
the
area
that
the
first
inquiry
is
the
initial
inquiry,
the
same
inquiry
which
kentucky
finance
recognized
must
be
made.
and
that
is
whether
the
particular
sales,
whether
the
sale
or
earthmover
tires
to
construction
company
to
--
for
a
bigger
improvement
contract
whether
can
be
eligible
can
ever
be
recognized
as
a
retail
sale.
whether
the
sales
of
these
heavy
truck
tires
to
a
big
trans
--
interstate
transportation
carrier
can
ever
be
and
that
this
is
an
equipment
designed
solely
for
that
type
of
truck
or
bus,
whether
that
can
ever
be
recognized
as
retail.
and
then
the
second
area,
an
inquiry,
is
assuming
that
you
have
the
type
of
tires
and
we
admit
that
some
business
--
some
business
sales
congress
apparently
did
want
to
leave
open
for
a
recognition
as
retail
and
we
say
those
sales
are
limited
to
sales
which
are
comparable
to
the
type
of
sales
previously
--
commonly
understood
as
retail
and
the
sales
that
are
treated
like
retail
sales
not
to
sales
that
are
simply
called
retail
sales
regardless
of
how
their
functional
aspects
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
regardless
of
any
functional
features.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
would
say
it's
not
solely,
because
it's
for
business
use.
what
i'm
saying
is
there
is
a
concept,
a
traditional
statutory
concept
that
is
not
dependent
on
the
business
use
test.
and
that
is
that
it's
limited
to
the
kind
of
goods
and
the
kind
of
services
that
are
sold
to
--
sold
locally
to
consumers
at
the
end
of
the
flow
of
the
interstate
commerce
and
that
does
not
take
in
heavy
equipment,
a
specialized
business
services
that
are
designed
and
adopted
typically
to
serve
interstate
producers
of
goods
for
commerce
or
interstate
transportation
commerce.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
the
particular
example
you
gave,
mr.
justice
fortas,
may
be
the
type
of
sale
that
the
congress
intended
might
be
recognized
as
retail.
because
it
is
so
--
it
is
so
likely
a
retail
sale.
but
where
it's
obviously
designed
for
the
purpose
of
supplying
the
materials
to
produce
goods,
i
think
it's
the
difference
between
that
incidentally
they
purchased
along
with
everybody
else.
but
when
you
have
the
type
of
tire
that's
designed
for
production,
the
commerce
and
interstate
commerce
and
--
or
some
industrial
purpose
specifically
designed
for
that
purpose,
then
that
type
of
sale
is
not
eligible
anymore
than
the
production
as
in
the
servicing
of
manufacturing
equipment.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
we
cite
one
thing
in
the
statute
which
i
suppose
officially
cut
both
ways.
and
that
is
the
laundry
exemption.
i
think
that
actually
it
does
support
our
position
which
expressly
states
that
sales
to
transportation
communications
and
some
other
interest
in
manufacturing
business
sales
shall
not
be
considered
retail.
it
expressly
excludes
them
in
the
laundry
exemption.
now,
we
have
a
discussion
of
that
exemption
in
our
brief.
and
our
opponents
argued
that
that
congress
would
have
put
that
in
13
(a)
(2)
if
they
didn't
intend
there
because
they
knew
how
to
say
it,
it's
that
within
13
(a)
(3).
our
position
is
that
that
laundry
exemption
pretty
much
came
in
as
an
addendum
and
also
that
senator
holland
made
it
very
clear
that
he
thought
he
was
doing
no
more
there
for
laundry
as
he
was
giving
them
the
same
relief
from
roland
than
everybody
else,
that
all
of
the
other
retailers
were
getting.
and
he
made
this
quite
clear
that
that's
all
he
was
doing,
giving
the
laundries,
putting
them
in
the
same
position
as
the
other
retailers
would
be
in.
so
i
think
the
intent
is
implicit
there.
and
there's
also
i
think
some
explicit
statements
in
the
legislative
debates
that
all
--
that
supports
that
somewhat
too.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
think
there
is
some
language
in
the
legislative
history
that
says
you
look
at
a
lot
of
criteria
in
the
general
practices.
and
we
think
though
that
before
you
even
get
to
the
general
practices,
that
some
of
these
sales,
some
of
this
business
is
just
ineligible
just
as
the
business
in
kentucky
finance
was
and
as
we
argue
that
the
business
in
idaho
sheet
metal
that
some
of
these
sales
and
services
are
just
ineligible
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
as
to
--
as
to
the
rest,
you
would
have
to
look
to
the
practices
in
the
industry
and
make
the
determination
in
the
light
of
what
the
congress
said
it
intended
to
accomplish.
ms.
bessie
margolin
you
have
to
do
something
with
them
and
there
is
an
area,
as
i
say,
there
is
an
area.
obviously,
the
congress
did
intend
that
some
business
use
sales
should
be
susceptible
or
eligible
to
be
recognized
as
retail.
now,
it
gave
--
it's
not
unusual
--
the
legislative
history
isn't
entirely
clear
as
to
just
what
this
area
of
business
sales
was.
they
did
make
it
clear
--
the
debates
do
make
it
clear,
they
certainly
didn't
intend
to
go
as
far
as
the
industry
here
went
to
classify
everything,
every
commercial
sale
is
right.
and
they
did
specify
certain
types
of
sales,
which
they
said
were
not,
could
not
be
recognized
as
retail.
but
there
is
an
area
in
there
where
the
industry
recognition
would
operate.
now,
just
what
that
area
is,
is
not
entirely
clear
but
we
think
it's
clear
enough
to
show
that
what
steepleton
was
doing
here
was
far
--
it's
more
than
--
more
than
25%,
well
over
25%
was
not
within
that
area
where
the
retail
concept
might
operate
and
where
the
recognition
clause
would
come
into
play.
i
haven't
had
taken
--
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal
and
at
that
time,
go
into
the
quantity
discount
feature.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
just
like
to
make
some
comments
on
these
last
two
questions.
i'm
not
entirely
satisfied
with
mr.
burch's
answers.
i
think
justice
clark
you
asked
if
there
were
a
different
divisions.
we
described
in
our
brief
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
industry
representatives
which
shows
that
--
which
was
to
the
effect
that
large
tire
dealers
such
as
steepleton
do
maintain
separate
divisions
for
what
they
call
retail,
the
separate
division
of
wholesale
in
which
they
classified
sales
not
for
resale
and
a
third
division
which
they
classified
as
a
commercial
division.
and
steepleton
himself
testified
as
to
the
divisions
in
his
own
plant.
he
has
a
passenger
tire
salesman,
a
passenger
tire
division
where
you
can
go
into
the
plant
and
you
can
buy
your
passenger
tires
there
and
a
retail
salesman
to
wait
on
you.
now,
the
commercial
salesman
in
a
separate
step
and
they
go
out
and
solicit
this
industrial
and
commercial
business.
and
most
of
these
services,
the
repair
and
maintenance
services
rent
at
a
place
of
business
of
these
large
industrial
customers.
the
plant
on
monroe
street
is
used
essentially
for
passenger
car
servicing
south.
in
fact,
i
think
they
--
one
of
them
testified
they
didn't
have
much
room
in
there
for
the
trucks;
they
couldn't
do
much
of
it
in
that
plant
on
monroe
street.
then
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
you
asked
about
the
discounts.
may
i
take
to
deal
with
them?
ms.
bessie
margolin
marsh,
who
was
the
executive
director
of
the
trade
association
testified
at
length
about
the
recognized
scale
of
discounts
which
got
larger
as
the
potential
or
actual
purchase
of
tires
for
the
quantity
group.
and
he
also
mentioned
that
this
depends
to
a
great
extent
on
how
--
on
the
fleet
accounts.
they
have
what
they
called
fleet
accounts
which
then
--
which
most
of
the
witnesses
--
the
industry
witnesses
testified
and
then
they
operate
more
than
five
commercial
vehicles
and
they
have
special
discounts.
and
of
course
there's
room
for
bargaining
but
this
is
a
scale
of
discounts
that
they
start
bargaining
from.
there
is
considerable
competition
in
this
business
and
great
deal
of
bargaining.
and
one
thing
i
learned,
never
buy
a
tire
without
bargaining.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
this
case
has
the
additional
aspect
that
some
--
we
have
some
sales
and
it
really
overlaps.
some
of
the
sales
are
of
the
type
that
we'd
say
were
ineligible
for
our
recognition
is
--
of
a
retail.
ms.
bessie
margolin
but
there's
a
large
--
there's
a
large
area
in
here
where
their
sales
to
fleet
accounts
that's
there
--
as
they
recognized
this
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
in
the
first
part
of
the
business
insofar
as
the
retail
concept
applies
no,
i
would
say
no.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
would
say
this
certainly
has
been
our
position
that
the
retail
concept,
the
traditional
statutory
retail
concept
should
be
applied
in
determining
whether
sales
transactions
are
--
can
be
recognized
as
retail
are
eligible
as
much
so
as
determining
whether
a
whole
business.
may
i
just
take
a
moment
to
try
to
represent
this?
suppose
kentucky
finance
company
had
opened
an
appliance
shop
and
run
it
along
with
its
long
business,
it
certainly
would
not
have
made
the
lending
of
the
loan
business
eligible
for
the
recognition
as
retail.
and
we
think
that's
what
we
have
here.
there's
a
small
amount
of
retail
business
going
along
here
with
a
great
big
amount
of
business
that
is
--
that
we
say
is
not
eligible.
ms.
bessie
margolin
what
is
--
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
percentages
here
were
not
as
precisely
true
because
of
the
sleeping
position
our
opponents
--
the
respondent
took
in
this
case.
we
did
put
on
and
investigated
to
show
that
at
least
more
than
25%
of
it
was
in
this
category.
but
he
had
pretty
incomplete
information
and
we
got
--
we
got
no
evidence
from
the
respondents,
from
the
defendant,
to
help
us
to
determine
how
much
of
this
was
of
that
ineligible
type.
we
know
that
we
have
enough
that
was
at
the
quantity
discount
to
fleet
account
sales,
to
bring
it
well
over
25%.
now,
they
did
--
they
did
admit
that
from
75%
of
their
maintenance
and
recapping
in
repair
business
was
for
these
commercial
accounts
and
that
comprised
35%
to
40%
of
the
business
of
the
total
dollar
volume
business
alone.
that
is
significant
in
the
--
on
the
record.
so
that
we
--
we
think
the
record
is
clear
that
there's
no
doubt
that
in
those
two
areas,
it
would
be
well
over
25%
that
would
no
be
retail.
and
i
don't
believe
it
--
were
--
our
opponents
have
denied
that.
