mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
started
as
two
declaratory
judgment
actions
in
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
missouri.
they
were
brought
by
calmar
and
by
colgate-palmolive
company
against
cook
chemical.
cook
chemical
company
was
the
assignee
of
u.s.
patent
number
2870943
which
was
originally
issued
to
baxter
i.
scoggin
jr.
the
declaratory
judgment
suit
was
brought
after
cook
had
threatened
these
parties
with
an
action
for
a
patent
infringement.
and
the
declaratory
judgment
actions
sought
a
declaration
that
the
patent
in
question
was
invalid
and
a
declaration
that
it
was
not
infringed
by
the
device
that
calmar
was
making.
calmar
was
a
maker
of
plastic
spraying
devices.
colgate-palmolive
was
one
of
its
costumers.
it
purchased
these
devices
and
used
them
on
insecticide
bottles.
the
--
there
was
then
a
counterclaim
by
cook
as
there
frequently
is
in
patent
declaratory
judgments
suits.
a
counterclaim
for
infringement
and
that
injunction
and
damages
were
sought.
the
district
court
found
that
the
patent
was
valid;
found
that
it
wasn't
infringed.
before
passing
on
the
question
of
damages
under
the
rule
54(b)
the
district
court
certified
that
there
was
no
reason
for
entering
there
--
that
there
is
no
reason
for
delay
in
entering
a
judgment
on
the
issues
of
validity
and
infringement
and
under
it
such
a
judgment
which
was
an
appealable
order.
the
eighth
circuit
on
appeals
by
calmar
and
colgate
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
eighth
circuit.
there
were
then
petitions
for
certiorari
presented
to
this
court,
urging
the
court
to
grant
the
petitions
and
to
find
the
scoggin
patent
invalid.
and
that
was
the
question
presented
to
the
court
this
morning.
we
have
here
a
picture
of
the
device
that
is
disclosed
in
mr.
scoggin's
patent.
this
is
on
page
381
of
the
record.
the
device
is
essentially
a
sprayer
of
the
sort
that
you
buy
in
supermarkets
that
comes
mounted
in
a
bottle
of
insecticide
were
like.
here
is
the
--
actually
this
is
the
--
yes
this
is
the
assignee
of
the
patent,
but
this
is
a
cook
chemical's
product
sitting
in
this
bottle
here.
what
this
consist
of
is
a
pump
which
goes
down
into
the
bottle
--
the
bottle
would
be
down
here.
the
pump
itself
is
not
patented.
the
pump
is
an
old
pump.
there
is
nothing
new
about
pump.
what
is
new
supposedly
in
the
scoggin
patents
is
the
idea
of
putting
this
cap
over
the
pump
and
holding
the
pump
down
during
shipment
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
putting
this
cap.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes
sir
cap
over
the
pump.
supposedly
the
new
feature
was
putting
that
capital
of
the
pump
and
affecting
a
seal
within
the
cap.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
actually
about
20
years
before
there
was
a
device
with
cap
on
it
in
the
bottle.
in
the
manufacture
of
insecticides
during
the
1950's,
neither
of
the
--
of
the
companies
that
were
making
plastic
dispensers
were
--
were
making
them
with
a
cap.
that
was
a
cap
in
place.
however,
about
20
years
before
there
was
a
comparable
structure
which
we
will
show
in
a
few
moments.
previously
the
merchandizing
technique,
if
you
will,
had
been
to
take
the
bottle
of
insecticide,
have
a
plain
cap
on
it,
have
a
paper
collar
attached
to
that
cap,
and
have
a
sprayer
attached
to
that
paper
collar.
and
there
were
certain
commercial
problems
with
that
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
right.
there
are
certain
commercial
problems
with
that
the
sprayers
supposedly
would
fall
off
and
go
light
so
the
idea
that
scoggin
suppose
to
come
up
with
is
to
put
the
plunger
into
the
bottle
and
put
a
cap
on
the
bottle
to
hold
the
plunger
down
during
shipment.
so
that
when
bought
the
insecticide
or
whatever
product,
you
bought
it
with
the
pump
already
in
place.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
in
order
for
the
consumer
to
use
it,
the
consumer,
of
course,
have
to
remove
the
cap
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
sir.
the
device
a
little
closer
is
this
device
here.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
white
thing
is
capped.
it's
a
cap
with
the
screw
thread
of
the
inside
and
there
was
a
little
--
oh
i
suppose
the
patent
bar,
we'd
call
a
protuberance.
there
is
a
little
thing
inside
here
that
affects
a
seal
with
the
cap.
now
the
reason
why
there
had
to
be
a
seal
within
that
cap
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it's
not
a
washer;
it's
just
a
--
a
part
of
the
--
the
plastic
cap.
it's
just
the
way
the
plastic
cap
is
molded,
so
to
speak.
the
reason
why
there
has
to
be
a
seal
was
that
in
the
pumps
at
this
time,
there
was
no
way
of
preventing
the
fluid
from
flowing
up
through
the
pump
and
out
of
the
nozzle
of
the
sprayer
during
shipment.
scoggin
did
go
of
any
way
to
stop
that.so
the
way
that
he
chose
to
prevent
leakage
was
to
put
a
seal
inside
this
cap.
he
put
that
seal
right
here
up
above
the
screw
threads.
now,
if
you're
going
to
have
a
cap
sitting
on
top
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
something
would
come
out
thought
--
something
would
come
out
of
the
hole
in
the
pump
here
and
it
would
--
it
could
fill
up
in
here.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
if
the
seal
were
perfect.
there
certainly
was
the
question
about
that.
if
the
seal
was
perfect,
it
would
stop
it
from
flowing
out
and
soiling
during
shipment.
now,
starting
from
scratch,
if
there
had
been
no
prior
right
or
whatsoever,
we
contend
that
it
would
be
a
very
good
to
this
proposition
to
hold
about
scoggin's
bottle
cap,
put
down
over
the
plunger
and
affecting
a
seal.
it
appears
to
be
one
of
the
very
obvious
places
to
put
seal
above
the
screw
threads
which
is
the
same
place
where
your
seal
exists
in
a
garden
hose
company.
even
without
any
prior
art
we
would
suggest
very
strongly
that
--
that
would
be
an
obvious
thing
to
do.
that
that
would
not
be
an
invention
and
that
accordingly
there
would
be
no
basis
to
issue
mr.
scoggin
a
patent.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it's
certainly
useful
that
there
--
it
had
imperfection
where
it
was
certainly
useful
and
the
utility
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
goes
to
invention.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
what
ever
it
a
--
it's
the
standards.
one
might
wonder
--
anyway
i've
never
thought
of
this
before
and
actually
the
answer
is,
yes.
in
1938,
there
was
a
patent
issued
to
a
gentleman
called
mr.
lohse
and
this
figure
appears
on
page
477
of
the
record.
this
patent
has
all
of
the
elements
of
the
scoggin
patent.
here
we
have
a
plunger
sitting
on
the
bottle.
here
we
have
a
cap
which
is
put
down
over
the
plunger
and
which
holds
the
plunger
down
during
shipment.
mr.
lohse,
like
mr.
scoggin,
didn't
know
how
to
seal
down
here
inside
the
pump
and
to
prevent
the
fluid
from
coming
up
and
getting
into
the
cap
here.
so
he
had
to
have
the
seal
in
the
cap
and
actually
there
are
two
places
where
you
could
put
the
seal;
you
could
put
the
seal
below
the
threads
or
you
can
put
the
seal
up
here
above
the
threads.
what
mr.
lohse
did
was
to
put
the
seal
down
here
below
the
threads
and
as
what
we've
just
seen
what
mr.
scoggin
did
was
to
put
the
seal
up
here
above
the
threads.
i
think
if
you're
talking
about
places
where
you
might
put
a
seal
in
a
bottle
cap
of
the
sort
that
that
exhausts
the
two
possibilities.
now
when
mr.
scoggin
first
put
in
his
patent
application
to
the
patent
office,
he
had
about
15
claims.
now,
the
function
under
the
patent
statute
of
the
claims
is
to
define
the
invention
as
to
which
the
inventor
claims
a
monopoly
punishments
of
the
patent.
the
first
15
claims
that
he
put
in
were
really
broad
enough
to
make
--
to
describe
the
lohse
device.
there
were
entirely
broad
terms
and
they've
described
the
function
of
a
pump
with
an
over-cap
with
a
seal
in
an
arrangement
--
neutral
arrangement,
either
like
this
or
like
his
own.
the
patent
office,
to
its
credit,
rejected
that
by
citing
the
lohse
patent
against
us.
then
there
were
a
few
other
actions
back
and
forth
with
the
patent
examiner
writing
to
mr.
scoggin.
mr.
scoggin
taking
up
aggressively
narrower
and
narrower
claims
until
finally,
the
patent
office
issues
him
a
patent
when
his
claims
have
been
narrowed
down
to
describe
the
specific
technique
of
his
seal
that
is
his
placement
of
the
seal
up
here,
and
the
fact
that
he
put
a
cap
down
there
so
that
you
could
pack
it.
so
that
you
could
screw
the
cap
down
and
before
you
got
to
the
container
cap
itself,
this
seal
here
would
catch,
so
to
speak
and
he
put
the
--
put
a
cap
in
there
so
that
that
wouldn't
happen.
essentially,
that
was
what
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
lohse
device
lead
to
it
and
in
fact
there
was
evidence
from
the
one
of
the
officials
of
the
company
that
merchandized
the
lohse
device
that
it
was
satisfactory.
according
to
his
recollection,
this
was
a
long
time
ago
it
was
in
the
late
30s
before
the
second
world
war.
but
that
was
his
testimony
and
it
was
not
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
patent
in
suit
starts
at
page
510
and
the
basic
claim
is
the
claim
that
appears
denoted
as
number
one
on
page
512.
it's
all
one
sentence
and
it's
about
350
words
long
i
believe.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
suit
--
the
claims
one
and
two
were
the
claims
that
were
charged
against
per
class.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no
it
did
not,
sir.
now,
there
--
as
we
say
there
are
really
only
two
places
in
which
scoggin
put
a
--
could
have
put
the
seal
in
the
bottle
cap,
below
the
threads
or
above
the
threads.
i
don't
know
if
any
further
demonstration
is
necessary
to
show
that
it
was
an
obvious
thing
to
put
the
seal
above
the
threads
but
we
have
found
a
few
patents
which
disclose
the
idea
of
putting
a
fluid
seal
up
above
screw
threads.
the
first
one
of
these
is
a
patent
issued
to
mr.
mellon
in
1952.
here
we
have
an
arrangement
which
is
quite
like
lohse
and
quite
like
the
ultimate
scoggin
patent
except
that
what
you
have
here
is
a
cap
that
fits
directly
down
on
the
bottle
rather
than
on
the
underlying
bottle
cap.
in
other
words,
in
this
arrangement
you
don't
have
the
second
bottle
cap
here
but
you
have
it
in
the
scoggin
and
the
lohse
devices.
but
we
cite
this
to
show
the
positioning,
the
prior
art
in
positioning
a
seal
in
an
arrangement
of
this
sort.
here,
we
have
the
seal
put
up
here
above
the
screw
threads
in
a
hold-down
cap
that
holds
down
a
pump
which
is
exactly
the
same
place
and
exactly
the
same
technique
that
mr.
scoggin's
patent
teaches.
actually,
as
i
mentioned
before
the
common
garden
hose
is
now
even
mellon
drawing
as
at
page
457
of
the
record.
the
garden
hose
i
believe
uses
the
same
technique
with
the
washer
inside.
you
will
have
a
coupling
with
a
screw
thread
and
up
above
the
coupling
that
you
would
have
a
rubber
washer.
so
that
when
you
plug
the
other
element
in,
tighten
them
up
the
end
of
the
one
half
of
the
garden
hose
would
fasten
and
seal
in
your
washer
up
here.
there
are
other
examples
besides
the
mellon
patent
of
the
particular
technique
of
positioning
the
seal
where
mr.
scoggin
positions
his.
one
rather
interesting
one
is
the
patent,
it's
disclosed
in
the
patent
issued
to
a
mr.
livingston.
this
was
in
1955
and
again
a
few
years
before
mr.
scoggin's
patent
was
applied
for
it.
mr.
livingston
was
dealing
with
hydrofluoric
acid.
apparently,
he
was
either
an
employee
or
on
retainer;
he
had
some
relationship
with
the
company
that
had
to
deal
with
hydrofluoric
acid
which
is
highly
toxic.
now,
this
was
dealt
within
flasks
or
bottles
that
have
to
have
pouring
spouts
on
the
top,
this
is
a
pouring
spout.
and
the
pouring
spout
can
be,
in
this
patent,
can
be
put
into
the
bottle
itself,
here's
the
bottle,
through
a
--
an
arrangement
which
--
which
holds
it.
now,
what
livingston's
idea
was,
was
to
again
take
an
over-cap
or
hold-down
cap
and
depressed
the
pouring
spout
of
it.
and
then
effect
a
seal
up
here,
in
the
very
same
place
that
mr.
scoggin
effected
it,
up
above
the
screw
threads
that
join
the
over-cap
to
the
housing
of
the
pouring
spout
here.
now,
what
this
--
incidentally,
what
this
was
trying
to
achieve
was
as
follows,
the
hydrofluoric
acid
would
leak
out
of
the
pouring
spout.there
was
no
seal
up
here.
and
if
you
didn't
have
this
arrangement
here,
which
allowed
it
to
flow
black
into
the
bottle,
the
fellow
who
opened
up
the
cap
would
get
the
hydrofluoric
acid
on
his
hands.
now
this
permitted
it
to
flow
back
down
to
the
bottle.
there
was
a
seal
up
here
which
prevented
it
from
getting
out
of
the
having
the
arrangement
here.
this
seal,
i
think,
is
in
the
same
position
and
performs
the
same
function
like
the
seal
in
the
scoggin
patent.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
lohse
patent
was
before
the
examiner,
that
was
the
basis
for
his
rejection
all
the
early
claims
of
scoggin.
the
livingston
patent
was
not
before
the
examiner.
mellon
was
before
the
examiner
in
the
late
stages.
he
does
not
that
refer
to
it
in
the
early
stages.
but,
in
the
later
stages
of
the
examiner
he
surely
did
but
livingston
was
not.
the
examiner
never
found
livingston.
somewhat
graphic
way
of
showing
what
scoggin
did
here
and
what
calmar
did
at
about
the
same
time
though
it's
only
a
partial
showing
of
what
calmar
was
doing.
it
is
describe
by
this
part.
here,
we
have
a
sprayer
sitting
in
the
bottle.
this
is
a
non-patented
sprayer,
the
sort
of
sprayer
was
known
in
the
prior
art.
the
two
prior
sprayers
that
would
--
did
not
have
over-caps
of
these
two
manufactures.
calmar
is
just
20.
it
was
shown
here
the
prior
to
cook,
sprayers
quite
like
that
the
cooks
sprayers
called
the
bakan
1.
this
advice
here,
that
commercial
device
made
under
the
scoggin
patent
is
called
the
bakan
2.
bakan
is
a
trade
name
of
chemical
uses.
the
--
take
a
livingston
type
cap
with
your
screw
thread
and
you
seal
up
here.
and
if
you
build
up
the
surface
here
in
order
to
receive
what
that
is
by
putting
the
other
element
of
the
screw
thread
there
and
putting
some
element
that
will
key
into
that.
there
what
you
produce
equally
is
the
device
in
which
scoggin
got
a
patent
and
the
device
that
calmar
produced
that
was
held
to
infringement.
actually
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
cal
--
calmar
later
achieved
the
patent
which
was
basically
on
the
elements
lower
down
in
the
bottle
to
which
i'll
address
myself
in
a
moment.
the
--
actually,
the
prior
art
thought
of
better
type
seal
than
the
one
that
scoggin
had
put
in
though
this
is
hardly
dispositive.
it's
--
scoggin
had
the
simple
pressure
type
seal
just
to
surface
inside
the
bottle
cap.
calmar,
like
the
livingston
cap,
had
sort
of
the
tongue-and-groove
arrangement
like
this
such
as
what
you
have
in
high
quality
wood
flooring
and
the
--
and
the
like,
the
tongue-and-groove
arrangement.
actually,
what
calmar
did
in
the
ss-40
that
was
important
in
the
ss-40
did
come
out
after
the
bakan
2.
well,
what
calmar
did
in
the
ss-40
was
to
provide
internal
seals,
that
is,
it
seals
down
in
the
bottom
part
of
the
pump
and
seals
up
inside
here
inside
the
pump
and
these
seals
prevent
the
fluid
from
getting
into
the
bottle
cap
in
the
first
place.
and
actually,
that
in
turn
is
important
because
besides
containing
the
fluid
inside
the
bottle
cap
is
a
further
question
in
this
area,
it's
the
question,
what
happens
to
the
housewife
when
she
opens
the
cap
and
the
fluid
that's
in
the
cap
might
come
out
under
the
bakan
2
arrangement.
there
is
nothing
that
prevents
it
from
getting
up
here
into
the
cap
under
the
calmar
arrangement.
it
would
not
get
into
the
cap.
if
there
were
any
commercial
problems
here
and
the
respondent
has
talked
about
them
rather
than
talking
about
the
prior
art.
if
there
are
any
commercial
problems
here,
they
resolve
by
keeping
the
fluid
inside
the
pump.
our
contentions
in
this
case
are
quite
simple.
whichever
way
you
phrase
the
standard,
the
scoggin
device
is
not
an
invention.
put
it
in
the
terms
of
section
103,
the
modification
that
scoggin
did
of
the
prior
art
of
the
lohse
patent
simply
consisted
of
an
obvious
modification.
taking
a
sealing
technique
that
was
taught
in
a
number
of
prior
art
patents
and
in
fact
probably
needed
no
teaching
and
simply
using
that
is
a
modification
of
the
lohse
device.
the
repositioning
of
the
seal
was
obvious.
it
was
not
an
invention.
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
are
two
principal
fallacies
that
were
committed
by
the
patent
office
and
by
the
lower
courts
here
that
have
combined
and
created
the
--
we
submit,
the
necessity
of
this
court's
reviewing
and
reversing
the
judgment
here.
the
first,
of
course,
is
the
fallacy
of
the
patent
office
in
granting
countless
patents
while
they
can
be
counted
there
about
60
or
65,000
a
year
now.
most
of
which
cover
trivial
modifications
of
prior
art
devices
and
a
shocking
number
of
which
cover
gadgets
with
the
sort
of
this,
that
is
involve
in
the
suit.
the
claims
as
allowed
in
other
patent
office
frequently
are
very,
very
narrow.
but
what
happens
is
that
these
patents
are
licensed
to
sue.
you
can't
bring
a
patent
suit
without
a
patent.
once
these
patents
get
into
the
courthouse
there
are
these
attempts
to
broaden
them
and
to
refer
to
the
commercial
history
of
what
went
on.
and
that
i
think
is
the
fallacy
that
the
lower
courts
committed
which
compounded
the
error
that
the
patent
office
committed.
the
question
is
far
as
the
lower
courts
were
concerned
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
most
of
the
language,
they've
cited
all
the
right
cases
and
they
--
their
quotations
are
accurate.
but
the
--
again
it's
a
case
of
the
difference
between
the
letter
and
the
spirit.
the
basic
question
that
the
lower
courts
decided
really
was
which
manufacturer
of
plastic
sprayers
for
insecticides
in
the
late
1950s
was
the
first
to
reach
the
market
with
the
sprayer
that
could
be
shipped
in
place.
and
bakan
cook
chemical
did
come
out
of
the
whole
bit
before
calmar.
the
lower
courts
lost
cite
of
what
is
the
essential
question
whether
in
terms
of
the
prior
art,
there
was
an
invention,
there
was
an
advance
that
was
not
obvious.
there
was
an
advance
that
was
not
part
of
the
everyday
work
of
the
engineer
whether
working
in
plastics
or
working
in
whatever
fields.
whether
there
was
something
here
that
transcended
the
routine.
that
is,
we
suggest,
the
basic
error
that
was
committed
by
the
lower
court.
we
submit
that
it
was
an
error
of
law
and
that
this
court
is
perfectly
free
to
correct
it.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
they're
not
totally
irrelevant.
i
think
this
court
has
not
said
they
are
totally
irrelevant.
this
court
has
said
they
are
adequate.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
the
reason
why
calmar
was
working,
it
was
because
they
wanted
to
develop
the
internal
sealing
in
this
device.
there
are
lots
of
prior
efforts
that
the
respondent
cites
were
unsuccessful
on
the
part
of
calmar.
but
all
of
those
efforts
were
not
aimed
in
the
direction
of
simply
putting
a
cap
over
the
plunger
and
holding
the
fluid
inside
the
cap.
they
were
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
they
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
right.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
what
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
because
they're
attempting
to
make
a
--
the
reason
why
calmar
was
not
--
was
to
--
because
they
wanted
to
make
a
seal
down
below
and
inside
the
bottle.
and
not
free
allow
the
flow
to
get
up
into
the
cap.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
suppose
there
were
reasons
of
--
there
may
have
been
reasons
of
a
company
as
to
--
as
to
why
cook
used
its
positioning
of
the
seal
which
of
course
again
is
an
old
positioning
of
the
seal.
in
lohse,
you
have
to
have
a
washer
on
top
of
the
bottle
cap
and
in
their
device
even
though
at
first
it
didn't
work
until
they
later
adopt
the
seal
which
was
like
the
petitioner's.
in
their
device
you
could
get
by
--
simple
by
molding
the
plastic
and
as
a
result
that
they
really
bring
out
the
device
according
to
the
record
that
cost
about
depending
on
the
piece.
but
that
--
the
claim
was
the
only
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
lohse
was
used
in
the
late
1930s
and
then
wasn't
used
again.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
until
they
--
in
effact
rediscovered
lohse,
i
don't
know
if
he
actually
knew
about
the
lohse
patent
or
not,
but
by
doing
some
--
by
using
something
that
was
available
in
the
common
stock
of
prior
inventions
or
was
an
invention
even
in
1938.
but
in
the
prior
stock
of
knowledge
this
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
can't
--
i
can't
get
into
that
question,
your
honor.
if
your
honors
please,
we
appreciate
the
opportunity
and
regret
the
necessity
of
coming
before
you
this
morning
and
telling
you
about
a
series
of
bottle
caps.
but
for
the
reasons
we
have
set
forth,
we
believe
that
this
exemplifies
the
situation
both
in
the
patent
office
and
in
some
of
the
opinions
of
the
lower
courts.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no,
i
don't
believe
that
--
as
i
remember
of
that
it
should
not
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
--
(voice
overlap)
by
this
panel
of
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
this
may
have
been
a
little
bit
after
--
after
the
graham
case
but
i
--
it
was
one
of
the
eighth
circuit
decided
in
favor
of
the
patentee.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it's
an
entirely
different
panel
from
the
one
in
the
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
from
the
--
the
one
in
deere,
yes.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
believe
all
three.
there's
no
--
no
overlap.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
may
it
please
the
court.
just
a
few
words
in
rebuttal.
there
appears
to
be
a
little
confusion
as
to
what
the
record
shows
as
to
the
use
of
the
lohse
patent.
the
testimony
as
to
the
practice
under
the
lohse
patent
back
in
the
late
1930's
appears
at
the
record
at
approximately
at
page
287
and
288.
and
there
the
witness
who
was
associated
with
the
company
that
practiced
the
lohse
patent
clearly
testified
that
it
inhibited
the
leakage,
that
it
was
capable
of
an
automatic
assembly.
in
other
words,
if
you
could
put
the
over-cap
and
the
sprayer
and
the
container
cap
together
and
then
put
them
into
a
bottle
which
was
exactly
what
mr.
scoggin
did.
now,
mr.
scoggin's
testimony
was
that
when
he
tried
the
lohse
technique,
there
was
leakage.
now,
perhaps
mr.
scoggin
had
some
sort
of
problem
that
his
device
helped
him
to
solve
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
lohse
according
to
the
undisputed
testimony
of
what
happened
back
in
the
late
30s
was
an
effective
commercial
device.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
fact
finding
involved
in
that
i
would
think
it's
clearly
erroneous
to
some
of
the
basis
of
this
record.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
there's
no
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
there's
no
support
in
the
record
as
to
lohse's
device.
the
record
is
unambiguous
of
lohse's
device
was
a
big
proof
back
in
1938.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that
lohse's
device
was
practiced
by
--
his
--
assignee
was
leak
proof.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that
starts
around
287
for
the
first
time.
in
any
event
the
further
contention
is
of
course
that
simply
using
the
seal
taught
by
livingston
and
taught
by
mellon
which
is
all
that
scoggin
did
was
not
invention.
the
prior
teachings
of
this
court
in
the
amp
case
in
the
marconi
wireless
case
of
this
case
where
the
patent
issued
to
the
great
marconi
was
held
invalid
for
warrant
of
invention,
all
indicate
that
the
dominant
concern
is
the
prior
art.
because
it
is
the
prior
art
that
people
are
to
be
free
to
draw
from
to
find
solutions
to
their
problems.
it
is
not
1/18th
of
the
question.
it
is
the
dominant
question
as
this
court's
decisions
teach.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
certainly
not.
