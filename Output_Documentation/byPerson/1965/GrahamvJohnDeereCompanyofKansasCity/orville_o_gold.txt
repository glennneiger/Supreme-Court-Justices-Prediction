mr.
orville
o.
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
patent
before
this
court
in
this
case
generally
referred
to
as
the
graham
'798
patent
because
there
was
another
graham
patent
that
was
cited
against
us
just
prior
to
graham's
patent.
this
patent
has
been
held
valid
twice
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
in
the
second
case
before
the
fifth
circuit,
the
same
prior
art
was
considered
as
was
considered
by
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
case
has
been
brought
here
by
certiorari.
the
record
on
page
15
had
a
stipulation
and
it
was
--
number
7,
it's
stipulated
that
this
prior
art
was
the
same
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
eighth
circuit.
with
the
same
prior
art
before
the
two
circuits,
it
necessarily
made
--
means
then
that
there
is
a
clear
difference
between
the
circuits
as
to
their
test
of
patentability
or
the
requirements
for
patentability.
of
course,
this
brings
us
to
sections
101,
102
and
103
with
the
patent
act
of
1952.
the
question
primarily
is
then
whether
the
eighth
circuit
applied
the
proper
test
the
requirements
for
patentability
when
they
substituted
their
judgment
to
that
of
the
trial
court,
reversed
the
trial
court
and
held
the
'798
patent
invalid.
respondents
in
their
brief
on
page
27,
suggests
that
petitioners
are
argument
at
section
103
established
a
statutory
test
to
patentability.
it
changed
existing
law.
we
don't
quite
say
that.
but
we
do
say
that
it
changed
the
law
as
applied
by
the
eighth
circuit
and
we
think
the
eighth
circuit
is
wrong
in
their
test
and
have
been
for
many
years.
a
few
brief
comments
regarding
to
the
statute
since
1790
congress
has
enacted
the
patent
laws.
and
the
first
one
was
entitled
an
act
to
promote
the
progress
of
useful
arts
and
in
that
act
and
all
subsequent
patent
statutes
until
1952
act
they
had
statutory
requirements
for
patentability
have
now
the
end-utility.
there
was
no
other
statutory
requirement
since
the
early
1952
act.
however,
this
court
in
1850
in
the
hotchkiss
versus
greenwood
applied
as
a
requirement
of
patentability
that
the
invention
be
more
than
they
worked
over
the
mechanic
in
the
art.
in
other
words,
in
addition
of
being
new
and
useful
it
had
to
involve
a
greater
degree
of
skill
and
ingenuity
than
that
possessed
by
the
ordinary
mechanic
acquainted
with
the
business.
down
through
the
years
this
same
rule
has
been
applied
with
this
court
with
some
verbal
variance.
there's
been
associated
comments
in
the
different
opinions
and
i
believe
that
some
of
these
comments
have
been
taken
up
by
the
lower
courts
and
thereby
had
departed
from
what
this
court
has
been
holding.
we
say
the
eighth
circuit
is
one
that
has
been
doing
this.
even
prior
to
1952,
the
eighth
circuit
took
position
that
this
court
had
raised
the
standards
of
originality
necessary
to
sustain
patents.
in
the
record,
in
this
case
before
in
the
court
on
page
925
the
eighth
circuit
in
its
opinion
stated
this
court
has
adhered
to
the
position
that
since
cuno
engineering
corporation
versus
automatic
devices
corporation
the
amount
of
originality
and
ingenuity
over
and
beyond
now
the
--
and
utility
which
will
constitute
invention
necessary
to
sustain
a
patent
for
a
combination
of
old
elements
such
as
we
have
here
in
a
crowded
art
has
increased.
we
also
reported
from
another
case
in
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
part
of
that
quotation
they
said,
“the
supreme
court
as
we
think
raised
the
standards
of
originality
necessary
to
sustain
patents
for
improvements
such
as
those
involved
in
the
instant
cases
regardless
of
their
usefulness
or
commercial
success.”
mr.
orville
o.
gold
yes,
sir.
i
can
do
that
mr.
justice
black
by
referring
to
that
decision
which
i
was
going
to
do.
on
page
930
of
the
record,
there
is
a
quotation
from
the
eighth
circuit
case
a
general
browns
corporation
versus
--
mr.
orville
o.
gold
yes,
sir.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
yes
sir,
volume
5
of
the
record.
they
bring
in
together
--
mr.
orville
o.
gold
930,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
bringing
together
of
old
elements
in
a
mechanism
involving
no
new
principle
to
produce
an
old
result,
however,
skillfully
done
even
though
the
result
marks
in
advance
and
efficiency
and
utility
is
but
an
exercise
of
mechanical
skill
and
not
convention.
now,
i
answered
your
question
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
yes,
sir.
my
point
is
that
they
have
said
that
it
has
to
produce
a
new
result
in
order
to
be
patentable.
i
don't
think
that
this
court
in
any
of
its
decisions
has
ever
said
that
it
had
to
produce
a
new
result.
it
has
mentioned
function,
new
function
or
different
function
but
never
has
this
court
requires
that
a
patent
produce
a
new
result.
the
eighth
circuit
in
effect
is
saying
that
if
an
improvement,
a
different
arrangement
of
parts,
a
given
operation
produces
the
same
result
then
automatically
it's
obvious
to
anyone's
skilled
in
the
art
or
having
ordinary
skill
in
the
art.
we
say
that
is
wrong.
we
say
that
an
invention
can
be
made
in
a
device
that
produces
the
same
result
as
another
older
device
and
still
involve
a
different
structure
and
be
patentable.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
say
that
we
can
do
that
with
both.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
i
think
that
you
will
find
in
all
three
of
the
cases
that
you
have
here
before
you
today
that
the
briefs
of
all
the
parties
have
not
been
greatly
in
cont
or
--
in
dispute
here.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
yes,
sir.
that
primarily
this
court
has
held
that
in
order
to
be
patentable
you
have
to
be
beyond
the
ordinary
skill
of
the
man
in
that
art.
some
of
the
wording
has
been
beyond
the
skills
of
the
colleague.
we
think
that
the
statute
in
effect
has
the
same
test
of
patentability.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
that
in
the
cuno
case,
the
ap
case,
all
of
the
cases
before
this
court
since
the
hotchkiss
case
as
time
really
had
the
same
basic
holding
that
it
had
to
be
non-obvious
in
order
to
be
patentable.
and
that's
--
we
are
being
--
it
were
that
and
i
think
that
everyone
of
the
parties
before
this
court
in
these
cases
are
in
agreement
with
that
as
i
read
the
briefs
i
read
all
of
them.
i
do
say,
however,
that
the
eighth
circuit
is
one
of
the
departures
that
were
referred
to
by
congress
in
their
reports
in
connection
with
the
statute
when
they
said
that
they
hoped
that
the
statute
particularly
section
103
would
bring
rare
uniformity
and
reduce
these
departures
that
had
occurred
before.
we
say
that
the
eighth
circuit
has
departed
and
set
up
there
own
standard.
they
have
in
effect
placed
additional
conditions
on
the
statute
and
we
don't
think
the
eighth
circuit
can
do
that.
they
have
not
followed
this
court
or
have
they
followed
the
statute.
they
have
not
even
applied
the
statute
in
connection
with
our
case.
they
pay
lip
service
to
the
statute
but
when
it
comes
right
down
to
what
they
have
said
in
their
decision,
all
they
have
said
is
that
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
was
that
we
had
an
improved
functional
result
and
this
was
not
a
new
result
and
therefore,
the
court
had
not
applied
the
stricter
standards
of
the
eighth
circuit
and
so
the
patent
was
automatically
invalid
in
that
search.
in
order
to
bolster
their
opinion,
they
took
the
position
at
even
assuming
the
trial
court's
findings
that
valued
a
significant
difference
or
a
new
result
that
they
still
felt
it
would
be
obvious.
he
made
the
statement
that
they
were
making
that
assumption
on
page
931
of
the
record.
i
will
read
the
first
four
lines
of
the
paragraph
starting
on
that
page.
furthermore,
even
assuming
that
the
trial
court's
findings
of
a
quote,
“a
slight
but
significant
difference
in
the
flexing
of
the
forward
portion
of
the
shank
that
is
not
found
in
the
prior
art,”
can
be
construed
as
finding
a
new
result.
and
then
they
went
on
to
discuss
the
case
and
say
that
this
was
an
erroneous
finding
at
the
lower
court.
however,
i
want
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
after
they
had
discussed
what
the
case
and
what
the
structure
did.
that
they
then
concluded
from
that
assumption
that
it
might
provide
a
new
result.
well,
perhaps
more
efficient,
the
inversion
of
the
parts
so
as
to
allow
the
shank
to
flex
downwardly
away
from
the
plate
above
it
did
not
bring
about
a
significant
new
or
different
result
and
would
have
been
obvious
to
a
person
having
ordinary
skill
in
the
art.
we
think
that
probably
made
an
assumption
that
was
a
new
result
they
turn
right
around
and
said,
his
stewardess
and
provided
new
results
so
it's
obvious
and
that's
all
they
did
in
their
test
in
which
they
were
applying
with
that
assumption.
it
is
our
position
that
the
eighth
circuit
has
applied
a
standard
or
test
in
the
requirements
of
patentability
that
they
have
set
up
themselves.
it
is
stricter
than
anything
that
this
court
has
ever
applied.
it
does
not
comply
with
a
statute
and
that
this
court
didn't
get
supervisory
authority
should
reverse
the
court
on
that
point
and
didn't
help
to
bring
out
more
uniformity
under
these
decisions
on
patent
cases.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
yes,
sir.
in
some
of
their
cases
they
have
made
indications
that
they
felt
that
the
statute
made
no
change
and
in
each
of
their
decisions
they've
cite
the
cuno
case
and
the
ap
case
as
according
to
their
standard.
i
say
that
they
have
gone
beyond
those
two
cases.
if
they
had
applied
merely
to
what
had
been
held
in
the
cuno
case
or
the
ap
case
then
they
would
have
said
that
if
it
was
beyond
the
calling
of
the
person's
skill
in
the
art
at
the
time
of
the
invention
it
would
be
obvious
but
they
wouldn't
say
it
had
to
provide
a
new
result
because
neither
of
those
cases
say
that.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
no,
sir.
the
final
sentence
refers
only
to
the
manner
in
which
the
invention
was
made.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
in
this
case
to
indicate
how
it
was
made
when
it
was
quickly
or
whether
it
involved
a
long
time
of
experimentation.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
yes,
sir.
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
yes,
sir.
i
will
go
into
that.
i
want
to
make
one
more
comment
on
the
statute
in
the
eighth
circuit
and
i'll
go
right
into
the
trial
court.
i
want
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
last
15
years,
the
eighth
circuit
has
considered
approximately
40
patents
and
all
those
40
it
has
sustained
the
validity
of
only
six
and
each
of
those
six,
there
was
a
trial
court
finding
of
a
new
result.
i
think
that
the
eighth
circuit
has
been
consistent
throughout
all
these
years
even
prior
to
the
statute
of
knocking
down
patents
if
they
did
not
provide
a
new
result.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
we'll
have
to
say
that
in
this
application
we're
talking
about
structures
wherein
they
are
made
up
of
a
combination
of
old
elements.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
yes
sir.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
yes,
sir.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
yes,
sir.
i
don't
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
would
apply
to
any
other
situation.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
and
that
is
the
situation
in
our
case.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
know
that
i
would
have
anything
in
writing.
i
won't
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
orville
o.
gold
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
would
mr.
justice
stewart.
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
invention
when
it
was
made
would
have
been
obvious
to
a
person
having
ordinary
skill
in
the
art.
that
is
what
the
statute
says.
i
think
that
is
a
different
way
of
saying
exactly
what
this
court
has
held
in
the
hotchkiss
case
and
in
the
--
mr.
orville
o.
gold
hotchkiss
versus
greenwood.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
and
all
--
mr.
orville
o.
gold
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
it's
the
same
thing
that
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
the
cuno
case
that
it
had
to
be
beyond
the
skill
of
the
calling
at
the
time
of
the
invention.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
yes,
sir.
of
course,
mr.
justice
black
the
way
your
question
was
worded
i
think
it
might
be
a
question
of
whether
or
not
this
was
a
matter
of
law
or
a
matter
of
fact.
i
think
that
the
final
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
it
involves
patentability
is
a
question
of
law
and
so
if
there
was
a
question
of
law
that
was
applied
by
the
trial
court
or
by
the
jury
i
think
that
that
could
be
reversed
by
the
appellate
court.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
on
the
issue
as
to
patentability
mr.
justice
harlan
i
think
that
there
are
facts
that
have
to
be
considered
in
arriving
at
the
conclusion.
i
think
that
the
actual
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
a
valid
patent
is
a
conclusion
of
law.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
yes,
sir.
of
course,
there
are
questions
of
facts
that
definitely
should
be
considered
in
arriving
at
that
conclusion.
i
think
that
in
this
case
if
the
court
of
appeals
in
their
decision
have
fairly
reversed
it
on
a
question
of
law
that
the
trial
court
did
not
apply
the
standard,
the
strict
standard
that
they
admittedly
apply
in
their
cases
and
therefore
did
reverse
it.
the
trial
court
did
not
find
a
new
result.
now
i
would
like
to
go
into
the
patent.
i
had
hoped
to
use
some
easels
to
point
this
out
but
i
decided
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
see
it
and
so
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
record
particularly
volume
three
in
page
577
shows
some
drawings
of
our
patent
that
was
in
suit.
we
say
that
the
eighth
circuit
did
not
actually
give
consideration
to
this
patent.
the
structure
was
new.
the
respondents
admitted
in
their
brief
on
page
28
that
the
particular
arrangement
of
the
elements
shown
in
the
'798
patent
was
not
shown
in
the
prior
art.
the
'798
structure
had
utility.
there
was
a
jeff
roy
clamp,
i
think
it's
exhibit
c
which
was
held
to
infringe
in
an
earlier
suit
and
it
was
stipulated
that
it
was
a
commercial
success.
that
was
stipulation
number
four
in
the
record
page
14.
so
there's
no
dispute
that
a
structure
such
as
these
clamps
and
the
respondent's
clamps
also
were
successful.
they
were
useful.
so
there
we
come
primarily
to
a
question
as
to
the
obviousness
of
the
structure.
in
a
--
talking
about
that
i
would
like
to
comment
first
on
the
problem
involved.
in
the
wheat
countries
they
do
what
they
call
chisel
plowing.
these
are
frames
matted
on
wheels
that
have
big
shanks
that
go
back
and
rip
open
the
ground.
originally,
where
there
was
not
much
rocks
they
had
the
front
end
of
the
shank
which
if
you
please
is
about
2
inches
wide
and
three-quarters
to
an
inch
thick.
they
were
held
immobile
on
the
frame
but
they
would
rip
through
the
ground
and
there
were
some
flexibility
in
the
shank
back
behind
a
framework.
there's
no
difficulty
when
there
was
no
rocks
but
when
these
cut
valves
are
moved
into
the
rocky
erritory
the
glacial
country
up
in
north
dakota
and
montana,
south
dakota,
those
valves
were
torn
up.
when
you
move
a
plow
at
maybe
6
miles
an
hour
across
the
ground
ripping
down
deep
in
the
ground
and
it
catches
onto
a
rock
its
immobile,
something
has
to
give
and
it's
going
to
be
the
plow.
so,
there
was
an
effort
made
to
try
to
eliminate
the
breakage.
our
client
mr.
graham
did
arrive
at
a
structure
that
solved
their
problem.
that
was
the
'811
patent
as
we
call
it.
then
he
wasn't
satisfied,
he
continued
his
efforts
and
made
the
'798
patent.
this
'798
patent
as
shown
in
the
--
particularly
in
figure
2,
1
and
2
of
the
drawings
on
page
577,
is
a
--
mr.
orville
o.
gold
yes,
sir,
justice
black
mr.
orville
o.
gold
that
is
rather
unusual
structure.
that
was
a
complete
change
from
anything
that
had
been
done
before
in
the
way
of
knotting
the
(inaudible)
with
plates
and
absorb
all
the
shock
that
would
happen
when
you
struck
a
rock.
the
structure
has
a
member
that's
fixed
to
the
frame.
under
that
there
is
a
hinge
like
member,
it's
pivoted
to
this
fixed
member
and
mounted
on
that
hinge
member
is
a
shank
of
the
plow.
the
only
connection
between
the
shank
and
this
hinge
member
is
a
bolt
at
the
forward
end
at
the
place
of
the
hinge
and
the
shank
is
coming
back
behind
it,
you
can
see
here
the
--
forward
in
is
a
bolt.
that
leaves
the
shank
free
to
move
relative
to
the
plate.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
that
picture
justice
stewart,
look
at
figure
2
right
at
--
they
forward
in,
which
would
be
at
the
right
hand
side
of
the
drawing,
number
55
refers
to
the
bolt.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
55
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
orville
o.
gold
it
still
at
--
the
left
hand
end
of
the
figure
towards
the
north
part
of
the
figure.
its
--
a
bolt
right
--
they
forward
in
or
right
inside.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
maybe
i
can
help
to
show
it
by
showing
a
chart.
here
is
the
bolt.
the
green
member
is
the
hinge
plate.
it's
hinged
on
the
blue
pivot.
the
shank
is
colored
in
pink.
now,
when
you
--
there
is
a
bolt,
a
spring
bolt
at
the
forward
end.
it
has
a
spring
that
tends
to
urge
the
shank
and
the
plate
up
against
the
fixed
member
and
that's
what
we
have
referred
to
as
home
based
position
normal
plowing
would
have
the
point
of
the
plow
in
the
ground
and
the
spring
hold
this
forward
end
up
against
the
plate.
now,
if
you
hit
hard
spots
in
the
ground
there's
going
to
be
a
tendency
for
the
plate
to
hinge
downwardly
and
it
will
cause
the
spring
here,
this
number
65
to
compress.
that
allows
the
--
an
opening
you
might
say
of
this
hinge
member.
that
will
occur
and
there
would
be
some
flexibility
in
the
shank
some
bending
back
behind
the
plant.
the
main
thing
is
when
the
point
of
this
plow
hits
the
rock.
when
that
hits
a
rock
it's
going
to
have
to
move
up
to
go
over
the
rock
and
that
can
be
done
as
the
hinge
is
down
here
compressing
the
spring
and
that
will
help
to
jump
over
this
rock.
if
it
doesn't
completely
jump,
with
the
compression
of
this
spring
and
the
bending
of
the
shank
then
you
can
still
have
damage
and
shock.
now,
our
structure
is
such
that
when
it's
--
in
move
--
hinging
it
up
it
will
flex
down
in
this
portion
of
the
shank
below
that
plate
member.
that
is
the
flexibility
that
we
say,
it's
different
than
anything
that
was
ever
made
in
the
prior
structures.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
in
a
patent
in
1883,
mr.
justice
clark.
it
was
a
rick's
patent.
there
was
also
in
the
same
year
a
cob
patent
and
it
was
--
in
our
judgment
the
same
structure
that
was
later
made
by
glencoe.
and
you
will
hear
the
respondents
say
that
all
we
have
done
is
turn
over
the
shank
and
this
hinge
plate
that
in
effect
is
the
difference.
in
the
glencoe
structure,
the
shank
is
above
the
plate
but
in
such
a
way
that
the
--
(inaudible)
--
in
such
a
way
that
the
--
when
it
flexes
or
when
it
swings
up,
the
shank
will
be
against
the
plate
and
it
will
tend
to
push
it
against
it
and
keep
it
from
flexing.
it
will
hold
down
solid
so
all
the
stress
is
back
behind
the
plate
that
gets
then
into
a
position
such
as
we
had
with
the
fixed
clamps
where
this
excessive
bending
in
the
back
will
cause
stress
and
break
each
of
the
shanks,
be
--
bend
beyond
the
elastic
limit.
they
do
have
some
bending
above
the
shank
but
--
if
your
honor
please,
there
is
a
sketch
in
volume
3
of
the
record,
that
would
be
plaintiff's
exhibit
w
on
page
653.
that
will
go
--
that
would
tend
to
show
a
form
of
what
would
be
similar
to
rick's,
glencoe,
and
those
prior
patents.
that
particular
sketch
was
a
rough
sketch
to
show
an
idea
of
what
would
happen
with
the
old
structures
and
in
those
--
when
it
swung
down
the
stirrup
or
loop
that
goes
over
the
shank
forms
a
fulcrum.
now,
and
it
forces
up
on
the
left
of
the
drawing
in
the
rear
of
the
clamp,
it
tends
to
force
forward
end
of
the
shank
down
against
the
plate
of
the
hinge
as
it
force
it
down,
the
bending
is
back
at
the
rear
of
the
clamp
so
you
have
all
of
the
excessive
bending
at
that
point.
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
for
rebuttal
sir.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
i
would
like
to
make
one
comment
first.
the
respondent's
attorney
has
indicated
that
the
respondent
didn't
care
about
making
this
device.
they
designed
around
it.
the
record
shows
that
the
respondent
was
making
what
was
called
a
pigtail
shank
type
of
plow
for
it
had
a
coil
in
the
shank
behind
the
clamp.
other
than
that
it
was
a
fixed
clamp
and
that
is
a
device
that
were
shown
in
the
record,
in
the
catalogues
in
the
page
put
out
in
the
first
(inaudible)
that
they
weren't
satisfied
with
that
type
of
device
because
it
wasn't
selling.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
it
wasn't
selling.
the
market
has
gone
to
graham
and
jeffrey
and
these
other
small
companies.
they
sent
men
out
in
the
field
and
made
surveys.
those
surveys
are
in
the
record.
there
were
two
of
them.
one
start
at
page
799,
the
other
one
start
at
page
823.
their
extensive
surveys
made
at
the
plows
that
were
in
the
field.
they
were
familiar
with
--
mr.
orville
o.
gold
the
surveys
--
one
was
the
defendant's
exhibit
30
starting
on
record
page
799.
mr.
orville
o.
gold
the
respondents,
john
deere.
they
made
a
second
survey
and
it
started
on
page
823
of
the
record.
those
were
rather
extensive
surveys
mr.
justice
black.
in
addition
to
that
they
made
up
a
prototype
and
sent
a
drawing
to
that
prototype
to
their
patent
department
and
got
letters
back
telling
them
that
their
device
infringed
the
'798
patent.
so
with
full
knowledge
of
the
patent
they
still
designed
one
like
it.
they
still
wanted
to
use
it.
they
were
found
by
their
own
people
that
they
infringed,
they
went
back
and
changed
two
little
tiny
parts
by
putting
a
little
bit
of
metal
on
it,
so
it
would
contact
the
fixed
--
the
frame
instead
of
the
fixed
member
that
was
fastened
rigidly
to
the
frame
just
a
little
bit
of
point
difference
in
contact.
they
said
we
are
out
of
the
range
of
the
claims.
we're
free,
we
can
use
the
idea.
i
think
that
the
record
clearly
indicates
that
they
did
want
to
use
this
structure.
i
would
like
to
make
one
other
comment
or
two
if
i
may.
there
was
a
contention
that
this
was
something
that
was
brought
forth
in
the
courthouse.
the
patent
disclosed
the
structure.
there
was
no
contention
any
place
that
it
didn't
teach
how
to
make
it.
and
i
believe
that
that's
all
the
statute
requires
us
to
do
in
describing
an
invention
we
must
disclose
it
so
that
is
sufficient
for
others
to
make
it.
and
that
was
the
case
here
and
we
feel
that
you
don't
necessarily
describe
all
the
functions.
you
certainly
don't
claim
functions.
that
has
been
criticized
in
the
past.
you
claim
structure.
we
did
that
in
this
case.
thank
you,
your
honors.
