justice
potter
stewart
you
say
that
mr.
gold
that
because
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
or
because
of
section
103
of
the
act
or
because
of
both?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
the
basic
agreement
largely
as
an
(inaudible)
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
to
say,
i
gather
mr.
gold
that
however
phrased,
the
statute
indicates
to
include
the
old
hotchkiss
case,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
has
the
eighth
circuit
expressed
their
view
on
--
i
don't
believe
it
did
in
this
case
but
has
it
expressed
a
view
as
to
the
effect
to
the
1952
act
on
the
existing
patent
case
law?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
not
involved
in
this
case
is
there,
the
final
sentence
of
section
103?
justice
potter
stewart
how
far
had
they
gone
of
course
carried
to
a
ridiculous
extreme
that
would
mean
if
the
--
i
supposed
the
electric
light
was
not
a
patent
because
previously
that
electric
light
gives
light
and
so
the
kerosene
lamps?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
confined
to
a
combinat
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
mechanical
combination
of
patents
made
up
of
all
old
elements.
justice
potter
stewart
the
doctrine
of
the
eighth
circuit.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
section
103,
wouldn't
that
be
a
proper
charge
to
the
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
the
bolt
on
--
in
figure
1?
what's
this
--
not
how
--
justice
potter
stewart
55?
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
does
it
appear
in
figure
1?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
was
talking
about
something
else,
he
was
talking
about
perfection
of
workmanship.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
all
you
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
protection
of
workmanship.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
beginning
with
the
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
suggesting
that
novelty
and
the
invention
are
the
same
thing?
justice
potter
stewart
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
understand
your
answer
to
my
brother
white's
question.
he
said
that
assuming
that
the
eighth
circuit
unambiguously
had
explicitly
said
that
a
--
one
of
the
distinct,
discrete
requirements
of
patentability
is
that
the
in
the
case
of
a
mechanical
combination
patent
of
all
elements
is
that
the
device
produce
a
new
result,
is
that
as
--
would
you
say
that's
a
correct
statement
of
the
law?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
you
don't
--
i
can't
find
that
at
least
in
the
statute
in
section
101,
section
102
or
section
103
and
earlier
you
told
us
that
the
statute
codified
the
case
laws.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
those
are
two
different
--
to
me
those
have
two
different
meanings,
those
two
phrases
for
something
which
produces
a
new
result
and
something
which
was
not
obvious.
they
may
or
may
not
overlap
in
any
given
patent.
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
the
statute
say
about
result
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
isn't
it
quite
right
that
there
was
no
attempt
to
follow
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
(voice
overlap)
--
i'm
talking
about
results
so
far
as
the
statute
goes,
isn't
that
correct,
both
courts,
both
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
eighth
circuit?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
read
what
you
said
for
the
fifth
circuit
they
weren't
talking
about
a
new
result.
they
were
talking
about
achieving
an
old
result
in
a
new
or
more
efficient
way.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
for
shipping
and
storage
purposes
not
for
use
by
the
consumer,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
the
function,
you
have
to
protect
the
business
during
a
shipment
and
storage,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
to
--
you
don't
question
that
this
is
narrow
or
as
utility?
you
question
only
its
quality
of
invention?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
only
issue
goes
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
invention
or
whatever
it
is
that's
probably
covered
by
section103.
justice
potter
stewart
the
record
of
the
claims
of
the
patent
in
suit.
justice
potter
stewart
are
all
four
claims
of
the
patents
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
much
a
standing
involved
this
prior
art
you
discussed
so
far
was
before
the
examiner?
justice
potter
stewart
lohse
doesn't
(inaudible)
of
something
like
(inaudible)
into
columbus?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lyons,
was
there
any
--
i
think
you're
concluding
but
before
you
do,
was
there
any
talk
in
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
in
this
case
about
the
necessity
of
a
new
result?
justice
potter
stewart
that
didn't
get
into
this
opinion.
