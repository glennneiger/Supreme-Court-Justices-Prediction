mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
if
respondent's
position
were
to
be
boiled
down
to
a
word,
it
would
be
that
we
consider
this
to
be
a
key
case
not
from
the
standpoint
of
this
invention
be
in
world
shaking
or
that
the
world
could
not
have
got
along
without
it.
that
because
in
this
case,
it
is
now
possible
for
the
court
in
our
opinion
to
remove
a
substantial
amount
of
confusion
that
has
been
going
on
for
years
in
the
lower
courts.
this
court
has
the
opportunity
in
this
case
to
set
some
guidelines
and
some
rules
and
some
regulations
that
the
lower
court
is
looking
for
their
needing
help.
they
want
help
by
a
compassion
for
the
problem
that
they
have
in
determining
whether
or
not
an
invention
is
obvious
or
whether
it
is
not
obvious.
it
is
our
position
that
the
eighth
circuit
in
this
case
took
the
right
approach.
certain
negro
doctrines
were
set
forth
that
this
court
can
adopt
and
can
do
so
without
having
to
change
any
laws
or
without
having
to
dig
up
some
new
principle
not
heretofore
heard
of.
what
the
cir
--
eighth
circuit
did
in
this
case,
was
to
first
look
at
the
statute,
finding
that
statutorily,
there
are
three
conditions
for
patentability.
it
must
be
new,
it
must
useful
and
then
under
103,
it
must
not
be
obvious.
but
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
stop
there.
as
soon
as
it
applied
the
statute,
it
went
into
a
determination
of
what
this
court,
the
supreme
court,
had
said
in
the
patent.
and
it
said
that,
“in
order
to
be
patentable,
an
invention
must
meet
high
standards.”
a
mention
was
made
earlier
this
morning
of
whether
or
not
the
last
sentence
of
103
is
of
any
consequence.
and
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
103
changed
the
law.
the
eighth
circuit
went
back
from
35
years
and
i
find
the
eighth
circuit
has
been
applying
exactly
what
103
has
said
for
smaller
than
35
years.
they
cited
a
case
of
pearce
versus
mulford
which
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
pages
31
and
42
and
which
the
language,
almost
identical
language
of
103,
is
used.
now,
if
there's
any
change
in
103
over
and
above
what
has
always
been
the
law
of
this
court
would
perhaps
be
in
the
last
sentence
and
we
can
only
say
that
maybe
the
supreme
--
the
congress
was
intending
to
say,
“we
don't
like
to
hear
the
court
say
flash
of
genius.”
well,
the
irony
of
that
is
the
only
reason
this
court
ever
use
the
word
“flash
of
genius”
was
to
make
a
point.
this
court
has
said
over
and
over
again
the
standard
must
be
high.”
they
have
used
all
kinds
of
language
to
make
that
point
clear.
and
one
way
to
do
it
is
to
say
there
must
be
a
“flash
of
genius”.
so
congress
early
in
the
last
sentence
had
in
mind
that
there
shall
be
no
more
“flash
of
genius”.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
that
is
not
our
argument
in
this
case.
we
go
along
with
the
concept
that
there
must
be
a
high
standard
of
invention.
103
merely
says
that
the
condition
for
patentability
that
has
not
before
been
in
the
statutory
law
is
that
it
shall
not
be
obvious
to
one
skilled
in
the
art.
now,
how
was
the
law
applied
in
the
eighth
circuit?
in
this
case,
first
of
all,
the
eighth
circuit
found
that
the
scoggin
invention
was
new.
now,
it's
not
very
difficult.
the
law
is
clear,
any
eighth
grade
school
boy
could
understand
what
you
mean
when
say
that
a
device
must
be
new
as
distinguished
from
something
that
is
old.
number
two,
the
eighth
circuit
followed
102
in
determining
that
there
was
novelty
that
--
and
that
there
was
utility,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
101
on
utility.
and
the
way
they
found
out
was
to
determine
if
there
was
widespread
use,
that
there
had
been
a
success,
and
there
had
been
acceptance.
certainly,
if
there
were
no
utility,
those
conditions
would
not
have
existed
and
for
that
reason
the
eighth
circuit
said
the
device
was
useful.
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
a
few
moments,
i
shall
enumerate
and
briefly
discuss
18
reasons
why
the
eighth
circuit
held
this
patent
valid.
but
before
doing
this
so,
i
should
like
to
first
continue
an
attempt
to
clear
up
some
of
the
confusion
as
to
the
law
and
how
it
was
applied
by
the
eighth
circuit.
the
question
was
asked
this
morning
whether
or
not
the
eighth
circuit
has
ever
interpreted
103.
i
do
not
recall
the
answer
but
in
my
opinion,
it
has
not.
in
the
blue
versus
dempster
case
which
we
cite,
a
1960
case,
at
pages
41
and
42
of
our
brief
the
eighth
circuit
said,
“in
applying
35
u.s.c.a.
103,
this
court
follows
the
standards
of
patentability
set
out
by
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
the
np
case.
and
that's
as
far
as
the
eighth
circuit
has
gone.
what
they
do
--
what
the
eighth
circuit
has
done
and
which
we
submit
should
be
done
by
all
of
the
circuits
is
to
first
consider
the
law,
the
statutory
law,
determine
whether
or
not
the
invention
is
new,
determine
whether
or
not
it
has
utility
and
then
attempt
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
obvious
to
one
skilled
in
the
art.
the
problem
and
the
difficulty,
is
determining
whether
or
not
it
is
obvious.
each
court
is
called
upon
to
within
--
but
a
few
hours
understand
the
principles
of
every
art
that
might
come
before
him.
whether
it'd
be
chemical,
electrical,
or
something
simple,
he
must
understand
it
and
determine
for
himself
whether
or
not
it
is
obvious.
i
submit
that
this
should
not
be
the
whim
of
the
judge
and
how
he
happens
to
feel
about
the
particular
art
that
he
is
considering.
did
i
submit
that
there
are
ways
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
obvious?
and
these
are
the
18
points
that
i
intend
to
discuss,
the
18
guidelines,
the
18
signposts.
they
are
referred
to
many
times
as
make
ways.
our
adversary
in
this
case
refers
to
them
as
something
irrelevant
to
this
case.
we
say
that
it
is
abundantly
rel
--
relevant
if
it
were
not
for
that.
if
we
were
not
to
look
at
these
18
points,
these
18
guide
posts,
then
all
we
have
is
the
statute
which
says
it
shall
not
be
in
obvious
and
we
have
the
judge.
and
the
appellate
court
and
this
court
having
it
determined
for
themselves
whether
or
not
it
is
obvious
simply
by
listening
to
one
bit
of
evidence
where
experts
will
say,
“yes,
it
was
obvious”
and
another
says,
“no
it
was
not
obvious.”
and
we
get
nowhere.
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
they
are
scattered
throughout
the
brief.
i
do
not
have
them
enumerated.
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
no.
but
i
shall
point
this
out
that
in
all
18
points
except
one,
this
court
has
passed
on
it
and
it
said
this
is
something
to
be
looked
at
to
be
determined
whether
or
not
this
invention
should
be
held
valid
or
invalid.
one
point
i
could
not
find
any
law
and
although
i
suspected
that
it
has
come
up
before.
again
before
going
to
those
18
points,
i'd
like
to
take
up
this
question
of
fact
or
law
again
which
seems
to
be
a
confusing
thing.
at
the
eighth
circuit
level
counsel,
my
opponent
was
asked
the
very
the
same
question
and
i
was
asked
the
question,
do
we
have
facts?
questions
are,
do
we
have
law
of
questions?
counsel
said
it's
a
question
of
mixed
fact
and
law.i
say
that
begs
the
issue,
that
doesn't
tell
us
on
anything.
let's
go
back
to
grave
--
to
goodyear
tire
versus
ray-o-vac
where
this
court
in
1944
said
that
it
must
a
strong
case
before
this
court
was
set
aside
concurrent
findings.
a
little
bit
later
in
graver
versus
linde
in
1950,
this
court
emphasized
rule
52
(a)
to
be
sure
there
was
a
dissent
in
the
case.
but
later
on
in
the
amp
case
again
the
question
came
up
as
to
whether
or
not
the
concurrent
two
court
rules
should
apply.
this
court
was
not
--
it
was
not
necessary
for
this
court
in
the
amp
case
to
decide
that
one
way
or
another
because
the
court
said
that
there
were
no
substantial
dispute
and
findings.
and
therefore,
the
amp
case
stands
for
a
principle
of
law
which
simply
says
that
when
you
have
a
claim
--
when
you
have
a
combination
claim,
that
includes
a
new
element
and
that
is
always
new,
you
should
claim
that
element
and
not
claim
it
as
a
new
combination.
we
have
no
difficulty
on
combinations
of
old
elements.
it's
very
simple.
if
you
got
a
number
of
old
elements
in
the
combination,
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not
that
combination
is
new.
the
difficulty
is
when
you
find
the
invention
to
be
only
in
one
element
and
that
element
is
new.
and
the
court
has
said,
“you
must
claim
that,
otherwise,
you're
overclaiming
your
invention.”
that
patent
office
says
to
us
over
and
over
again,
“you
have
an
old
and
exhausted
combination
that
you're
claiming
if
you
think
this
is
a
new
claimant.”
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
in
our
case,
we
have
a
combination
of
old
elements.
there
isn't
a
single
element
in
the
combination
that
is
new.
we
have
not
claimed
it.
we
cannot
be
accused
of
overclaiming.
we
have
claimed
only
the
combination.
we
said
that
combination
is
new
and
that
it
has
never
been
done
before
and
it
has
utility
and
it
is
not
obvious.
so
we
get
down
to
what
is
the
proper
approach.
and
we
find
that
as
a
conclusion
of
law,
the
question
of
validity
is
to
be
determined
by
the
court.
but
until
we
come
to
that
final
question
of
validity,
there
are
a
number
of
facts
that
must
be
considered.
otherwise,
we're
deciding
that
in
evacuant.
now,
the
18
points,
number
one,
the
record
has
established
clearly
that
there
was
a
need
for
this
invention;
that
the
need
existed
for
a
long,
long,
time.
and
one
time,
the
liquid
was
dispensed
with
a
hand
sprayer,
a
tin
hand
sprayer.
later
on,
the
sprayer
--
the
plastic
sprayer
was
hung
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
through
a
cardboard
holder.
what
was
needed
was
a
shipper
sprayer;
a
sprayer
that
could
become
and
then
it
will
go
part
of
the
package.
it
would
not
leak.
it
would
not
break.
it
would
not
become
lost
or
pilfered.
calmar
and
its
costumers
knew
of
that
need.
number
two,
we
had
a
problem.
the
record
establishes
--
it
establishes
the
fact
that
the
--
that
the
problem
was
baffling.
the
petitioner
say,
“supposedly
there
was
a
problem
but
their
own
witnesses
have
admitted
over
and
over
again
that
they
--
that
they
could
not
solve
the
problem.
the
problem
was
that
you
can't
simply
place
the
square
inside
the
container
and
let
it
go
with
that
because
it
will
leak
and
it
will
get
broken.
hanging
it
on
the
side
was
not
the
solution.
it
had
to
do
five
things.
it
had
to
hold
that
sprayer
depressed.
it
had
to
house
to
protect
the
head
against
damage.
it
had
to
prevent
leakage
to
the
outside
and
onto
the
label.
it
had
to
remain
sealed
after
it
had
been
once
sealed
at
the
factory.
at
the
time
the
sprayer
is
made
in
this
condition,
they
cover
copy
and
sealed
in
place
and
then
it
can
be
subsequently
placed
in
the
container
and
the
container
cap
--
the
metal
container
cap
can
be
sealed
through
automatic
machinery
without
disturbing
the
seal
between
the
cover
cap
and
the
collar.
those
were
the
things
that
mr.
scoggin
had
to
solve.
those
--
those
were
the
problems.
point
number
three
relates
to
the
skill
and
the
experience.
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
if
no
one
has
been
trying
to
solve
this
problem,
if
this
is
what
we
call
a
“wouldn't
it
be
nice
invention”,
and
we
have
many
of
those.
people
come
in
daily
and
say,
“wouldn't
it
be
nice
if
have
this
one?
wouldn't
it
be
nice
if
we
have
something
else?”
that
is
not
what
we
have
here.
we
have
the
skill
and
the
experience
of
calmar
who
had
been
a
leader
in
the
industry
in
making
sprayers
long
before
this
invention.
they
knew
what
they
were
doing
and
yet
they
couldn't
solve
the
problem.
they
had
many
engineers
on
their
staffs.
they
had
many
inventors
who
had
previously
invented
and
obtained
patent.
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
no,
no.
calmar
was
initially
formed
for
the
purpose
of
making
plastic
sprayers
and
then
they
when
went
on
--
0
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
plastic
sprayers
of
the
type
that
preceded
this
invention
without
the
cover
cap,
the
ordinary
sprayer.
and
then
ultimately
they
were
acquired
by
the
drackett
company
and
the
drackett
company
of
course
makes
many
liquid
products
and
uses
a
sprayer.
number
four,
i
term,
the
begging
for
an
answer.
now,
this
is
where
i
cannot
find
any
decisions
by
this
court
saying
that
this
is
a
factor
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
an
invention
is
patentable
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
invention
was
obvious
or
not
obvious.
but
we
did
have
urgent
pleas
to
calmar
by
its
costumers
including
cook,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
for
many,
many
years
for
the
answer.
over
and
over
again,
cook
says,
“will
you
please
come
up
with
something
that
can
be
use
as
a
shipper
sprayer
that
will
not
leak
and
will
not
break?”
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
would
not
break
--
would
not
break
--
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
break
--
break
the
sprayer.
because
hanging
it
on
the
side
we
had
the
breakage
problems.
if
you
try
to
merely
put
in
the
--
top
of
the
container,
it
obviously
would
break
in
shipment
long
before
you
ever
got
to
the
housewife.
number
five,
i
term
the
struggles,
now
the
--
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
the
struggles
--
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
as
--
i
heard
you
this
morning,
that's
a
good
question.
and
the
answer
is
this.
lohse
was
on
the
market
in
about
1944,
a
few
months
and
a
few
thousand
of
their
sprayers
was
actually
for
--
was
actually
produced
and
sold.
then
the
product
was
--
came
off
the
market.
now
why
the
evidence
doesn't
show?
so
far
as
the
lohse
people
themselves
were
concerned,
they
don't
have
--
they
don't
say
why
they
ceased.
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
that's
our
point.
that's
our
point
exactly.
if
lohse
is
so
good
--
if
--
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
the
point
that
we
make
is
that
if
lohse
is
good
and
that
lohse
anticipates
our
invention
and
that
lohse
will
lose
the
job,
why
did
they
infringe?
why
did
they
copy
us?
why
did
they
come
up
with
a
dead
ringer
as
the
courts
below
had
said?
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
and
the
answer
--
pardon
me.
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
because
lohse
would
not
solve
the
problem
and
the
reason
--
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
that
lohse
would
not
solve
the
problem
and
the
testimony
shows
that
you
cannot
seal
effectively
on
top
of
the
mellon
container
cap
for
several
reasons.
number
one,
the
gas
that
that
must
be
used
becomes
absorbed
with
the
material,
i'll
assume
this.
number
two,
these
container
caps
are
not
uniform.
they're
not
perfectly
smooth
on
top.
you
can
never
get
a
solid
seal.
and
number
three,
when
you
attempt
to
use
lohse
and
put
it
into
a
container
and
use
automatic
capping
machinery,
you
break
the
seal
that
you
attempted
to
establish
in
replacement.
that
is
why
calmar
did
not
use
lohse,
that
is
why
we
are
not
using
it
today,
and
that
is
why
scoggin
don't
--
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
that
would
not
work.
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
right.
it
would
not
solve
the
leakage
problems,
it
would
not
permit
you
to
use
automatic
machinery
in
--
in
putting
the
sprayers
in
place,
and
it
would
break
the
seal
if
you
tried
it.
now,
that
is
what
the
evidence
shows
and
to
say
that
--
that
it
would
work
is
contrary
to
what
the
finding
of
the
two
lower
courts.
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
there
is
a
finding
that
--
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
yes
sir.
there's
a
finding
in
the
court
below
to
the
effect
that
lohse.
that
lohse
was
--
they
did
consider
lohse
and
they
determined
that
lohse
was
not
successful,
had
not
been
on
the
market.
anyway
the
lower
court
indicated
it
did
--
did
the
lower
court
indicated
that
he
recognized
that
lohse
had
been
used
but
that
had
been
some
25
years
ago
and
it
come
off
of
the
market.
and
he
recognized
the
testimony
of
the
experts,
mr.
scoggin
himself,
to
the
effect
that
it
would
not
work
and
he
enumerated
the
reasons
why
it
would
not.
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
it's
a
--
it's
not
set
out
as
a
specific
finding.
no.
its
--
it's
all
a
part
of
the
opinion.
it's
all
i
--
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
the
trial
court.
right.
i
mentioned
as
number
five,
the
struggles
that
the
parties
had
in
attempting
to
come
up
with
an
answer.
device
after
device
was
tried
by
calmar.suggestion
after
suggestion
was
either
tried
or
submitted.
they
all
failed.
with
respect
to
the
affairs,
many
futile
attempts
were
made
to
fill
the
need.
the
president
of
calmar
and
the
vice
president
drackett
testified
that
he
had
said
in
grievous
experiences
in
trying
to
solve
the
problem.
at
the
time
that
scoggin
invention
came
on
the
market,
they
were
still
trying
to
perfect
an
old
leaker
called
the
lp-25.
s.
c.
johnson
tried
to
solve
there
problems
for
them,
they
put
a
cellulose
cap
on
top
of
the
lp-25
to
keep
it
from
leaking.
that
was
not
satisfactory.
in
other
words,
they
were
goaled
by
frustration
and
disappointment.
and
this
court
has
heretofore
indicated
that
that
is
one
factor
to
be
considered
when
determining
whether
or
not
a
patent
is
valid,
and
whether
or
not
it
is
obvious.
this
court
is
also
--
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
yes,
yes.
and
the
--
well
i
--
i
don't
know
but
there
is
any
one
most
valuable
the
leakage
problem
is
the
lack
of
breakage,
number
two.
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
breakage.
preventing
breakage.
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
yes.
and
then
number
three,
making
it
possible
to
put
this
on
the
bottle
at
the
bottling
factory
in
a
way
that
when
you
attach
the
mellon
caps,
you
do
not
disturb
the
seal
between
the
cover
cap
and
the
collar
inside
above
the
cover
cap.
counsel
said
this
was
a
thing
i
--
i
have
some
passion
for
him
to
here
too,
it's
called
a
--
it's
called
a
rib.
it's
a
part
of
the
cap
inside,
it's
a
rib
that
cooperates
with
the
shoulder
on
the
collar
and
that
affects
the
seal.
that
seal
must
be
there,
it
cannot
be
down
below
on
the
metal
cap
like
in
lohse
because
if
that
is,
you
have
leakage,
you
break
your
seal
and
the
gasket
will
absorb
the
moisture
it
just
won't
work
and
that
is
why
it
has
not
been
adopted
by
calmar
or
by
cook.
so
we
must
consider
the
fact
that
baxter
scoggin
did
come
up
with
the
solution.
and
this
court
again
had
said,
“if
we
can
find
that
the
problem
was
really
elect
and
this
is
a
solution
to
the
problem
that
must
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
invention
was
obvious
and
patentable.”
they
must
consider
the
results
of
this
solution.
this
is
open
up
in
many,
many
new
fields.
in
the
cuno
case,
in
the
cuno
versus
automatic
case,
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
result
was
old.
and
that
was
one
factor
considered
by
this
court
in
determining
that
the
invention
was
not
patentable.
in
our
case
we
have
just
the
opposite,
the
results
are
new.
it's
not
only
used
on
insecticide,
it's
used
on
virtually
every
liquid.
it's
branch
start
into
the
field
of
window
cleaners
and
hair
sprays,
and
polishes,
and
veterinary
product,
chemicals
of
all
kinds
and
medicines.
number
nine,
the
manner
of
arriving
at
the
solution.
there
is
--
the
petitioners
have
vacillated
in
our
opinion
as
to
what
is
the
invention?
we
have
defined
the
invention.
we
defined
it
three
times
in
our
brief.
it
was
adopted
by
the
courts
below.
and
our
petitioners
say
that
we
are
doing
a
very
fine
job
of
defining
the
invention
and
yet
they
vacillate.
they
tried
to
say,
“the
invention
relied
in
the
seal,
a
particular
type
of
seal.
it
relied
in
a
space.
it
relied
in
one
or
two
or
three
other
things.”
the
invention
doesn't
lie
in
any
one
thing.
the
seal
is
old,
the
space
is
old,
the
cap
is
old,
each
individual
element
is
old.
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
space
between
the
cover
cap,
the
space
between
the
cover
cap
and
--
it's
on
the
--
the
infringing
structure
above
the
black
line
which
is
the
cover
cap.
and
that
space
of
course
must
be
--
if
you're
going
to
establish
the
seal
but
that
is
what
--
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
if
you
scroll
and
lay
down
to
hit
the
cover
cap
of
the
container
cap
first,
then
you
don't
have
a
seal.
that's
quite
obvious.
it
wasn't
new,
it
wasn't
claimed
to
be
new.
now,
the
manner
of
the
solution
that's
number
nine
as
the
point,
number
ten
the
fact
that
the
patent
office
did
issue
the
patents.
there
is
a
presumption
of
the
validity.
it
is
now
statutorily
set
forth.
number
11,
we
have
a
new
combination.
the
old
--
the
elements
of
some
--
element
themselves
are
old;
that
is
quite
permissible
in
law.
we
have
the
prior
art
to
consider
and
the
prior
art
does
not
anticipate
this,
all
of
the
pertinent
prior
art
was
considered
by
the
patent
office
except
livingston
and
all
livingston
does
is
--
is
cumulative
of
a
particular
type
of
seal
and
we
do
not
invent
a
new
seal.
we've
got
to
consider
number
13,
the
utility
of
the
device.
it
does
have
utility.
100
complaints
sought
of
some
15,000,000.
it
was
not
perfect
but
it
was
nearly
perfect.
the
law
requires
much
less.
number
14,
we
have
acceptance.
the
product
has
been
accepted
not
only
by
the
public
but
it
has
been
accepted
by
our
adversaries
in
the
fact
that
they
copied.
number
14,
it
has
been
recognized.
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
both
claim,
there
are
two
claims.
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
in
the
record,
i
wrote
it
down
a
little
while
ago,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
525.
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
512.
there
are
two
claims
512.
i've
covered
the
acceptance
of
recognition.
the
fact
that
the
--
invention
has
been
directly
in
--
and
exactly
copied,
the
calmar
people
sought
the
same
inventions,
same
protection.
when
they
filed
their
own
application,
they
cited
lohse
in
their
application.
they
attempted
to
persuade
the
patent
office
that
they
could
get
a
put
--
a
claim
allowed,
the
same
as
our
view,
went
above
lohse.
these
are
all
things
that
are
here
before
considered
by
this
court
as
being
important.
number
18
and
the
last
is
the
fact
that
there
had
been
successors
by
both
parties.
our
petitioners
have
said
initially
that
the
only
reason
that
this
patent
was
held
valid
was
because
of
the
tremendous
success.
that
is
not
true.
i
have
listed
17
other
reasons
before
i
ever
came
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
successful.
and
then
in
the
reply
brief,
they
apparently
realized
that
they
had
build
up
commercial
success
too
much
whereas
commercial
success
became
important
to
show
utility
and
they
now
call
it
a
commercial
innovation.
i
don't
know
why
the
change
but
to
me,
a
commercial
innovation
is
synonymous
with
commercial
novelty.
so
if
they
are
now
saying
and
admitting
that
we
have
something
novel
then
the
only
question
that
remains
for
this
court
to
determine
is
whether
or
not
the
eighth
circuit
was
incorrect
in
implying
the
high
standards
of
this
court.
and
determining
that
there
were
factors,
18
factors
or
at
long
last
finding
one
valid.
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
i
--
i
agree
with
your
honor
in
saying
that
you
cannot
define
obviousness
or
non-obviousness
by
one
word,
yes.
so
what
--
what
must
we
do?
we
must
look
to
see
whether
or
not
there
are
18
points
or
five
points,
or
two
points,
or
none.
if
there
are
none
and
there
is
a
doubt,
certainly
then
it
becomes
a
problem
on
the
part
of
the
patentee
to
try
to
sustain
his
patent.
but
i'm
not
saying
that
the
absence
of
all
of
these
18
points
would
mean
that
there
would
automatically
be
no
--
no
invention,
i'm
not
saying
that
at
all.
i'm
merely
saying
that
when
the
question
is
close,
the
lower
courts
would
like
to
see
this
court
set
down
the
boundary
so
that
they
can
understand.
and
i'm
sure
they
want
to
follow
the
amp
case.
the
cuno
occasion
say
that
we
have
a
high
standard
of
invention.
they
want
to
follow
that.
but
what
they
say
whenever
the
amp
case
is
cited,
they
said,
“oh
well,
that's
fine
that
was
an
easy
one”.
obviously,
that
was
unpatentable.
anybody
would
say
that.
that's
what's
happened
over
and
over
again.
but
the
eighth
circuit
doesn't
say
that.
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
if
i
will
--
mr.
gordon
d.
schmidt
it
is
impossible
of
definition
except
that
we
do
have
these
guidelines.
we
need
this
guideline.
if
we
cast
them
aside
and
say
they
are
of
no
value
then
we
are
hopelessly
lost.
and
the
various
circuits
throughout
the
land
except
for
the
eighth
circuit,
if
there
has
been
a
getting
away
from
the
high
standards,
it
has
been
because
of
the
fact
that
rest
of
the
circuits
in
our
opinion
have
not
followed
what
the
eighth
circuit
says,
“when
we
apply
103,
will
you
follow
the
high
standards
of
this
court?”
and
they've
done
so
for
35
years.
and
this
is
a
perfect
example,
not
because
it's
simply
a
complex.
some
of
the
most
complex
devices
can
be
the
most
unpatentable.
anybody
can
put
--
anybody
could
solve
this
problem
or
something
complex
in
ex
--
in
expensive.
but
it
takes
--
it
takes
a
genius
to
do
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
marketable.
that
it
is
inexpensive,
that
it'll
do
the
job.
the
simplicity
has
no
bearing.
this
is
not
a
--
an
atomic
bomb.
this
is
not
going
to
help
us
get
to
the
moon
but
it
is
important
that
we
set
down
the
guidelines
so
that
the
courts
will
understand.
and
that
the
eighth
circuit
be
used
as
an
example
of
how
to
solve
this
problem
of
what
it
is
in
--
a
patentable
invention
and
what
is
not.
