(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
before
mr.
lyons
that
there
was
no
cap
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
white
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
he
put
a
seal
there,
would
something
still
come
out
of
that
orifice
in
the
pump
and
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
the
seal
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
anything
about
the
lohse
arrangement,
did
not
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
calmar
got
a
patent
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
the
industry
have
to
keep
working
so
hard
when
they
have
the
lohse
device
for
so
many
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
were
related
to
the
scoggin's
device
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
told
me
earlier
that
the
lohse
device
had
worked
just
as
effectively
as
scoggin.
he
didn't
add
anything
to
the
commercial
value
of
the
lohse
device.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
correct
in
that
instance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
--
why
they
keep
pressing
at
it
so
far
that
i
didn't
quite
understand.
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
--
why
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
see
that
--
really
i
guess
lohse
just
wasn't
used,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
all?
and
meanwhile
they
were
using
other
things
and
the
bottles
leaked
until
they
came
up
with
this
one,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
different
panel,
the
one
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
new
judges
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
about
the
man
before
you
leave,
it
if
you
don't
mind.
what
about
the
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
why
was
calmar
searching
so
hard
for
something
else
if
that
--
that's
so
quick.0
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
can
see
that
that
helps
you,
does
it?
if
--
if
lohse
was
really
a
--
dispositive
prior
art,
what
difference
does
it
make
that
calmar
didn't
make
use
of
it
and
decides
to
find
something
else
of
its
own.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
your
finding
about
lohse
and
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
lower
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
the
then
about
the
findings
of
fact
at
page
26
of
the
record
that
there's
not
finding
of
the
trial
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
its
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it's
rather
flat
isn't
it
that
the
lohse's
cap
would
not
solve
the
problem
it
was
faced
by
the
manufactures
and
sellers
of
insecticide.
and
then
--
including
sentence
to
the
next
paragraph,
this
form
of
contact
between
the
end
of
the
hold
down
cap
from
the
top
of
the
container
would
not
solve
the
problem
of
leakage.
you
say
there's
support
in
the
record
for
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
would
you
give
me
those
records?
