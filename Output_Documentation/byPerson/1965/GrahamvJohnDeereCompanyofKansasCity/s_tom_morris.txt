mr.
s.
tom
morris
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
let
me
answer
quickly
to
our
three
statements
that
were
made
before
we
commence
the
formal
presentation
of
our
case.
a
question
was
asked
to
mr.
gold
concerning
the
test
applied
in
the
eighth
circuit
and
he
read
a
statement
from
the
opinion
of
the
eighth
circuit
wherein
the
eighth
circuit
disapproved
a
rule
which
would
find
invention
for
mere
improvement
as
long
ago
as
1876.
this
court
in
reckendorfer
versus
faber
said,
"perfection
of
workmanship
however
much
it
may
increase
the
convenience
extend
the
use
or
diminish
expense
is
not
patentable.
that
has
been
think
a
consistent
rule
in
this
court
from
that
day
to
this."
mr.
s.
tom
morris
well,
the
question
asked
if
perfection
of
workmanship
improvement,
increase
of
efficiency,
economy,
those
things
this
court
has
always
said
are
not
enough
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
--
in
(voice
overlap)
case
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
alright.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
now,
then
we
will
come
to
the
answer
of
that
specific
question
by
analysis.
my
point
here
is
to
show
that
it
has
long
been
the
rule
of
this
court
that
mere
perfection
of
workmanship
mere
improvement,
mere
increased
deficiency
or
economy
is
not
enough
for
patentability.
now,
then
another
remark
counsel
made
which
i
would
like
to
answer
specifically
before
turning
to
the
body
of
the
case,
i
believe,
he
stated
that
he
did
not
contend
that
10
--
section
103
changed
the
law
and
it's
rather
difficult
to
understand
that
statement
when
at
page
23
of
the
brief
he
says,
"congress
in
section
101,
102,
and
103
of
the
patent
act
of
1952
provided
a
statutory
definition
under
requirements
of
patentability."
this
was
a
change
from
the
standards
of
invention
of
the
judicial
opinions
expressed
from
the
decades
immediately
preceding
the
patent
act
of
1952.
the
patent
act
was
expression
of
the
clear
intent
by
congress
to
return
or
restore
the
old
requirements
laid
down
in
hotchkiss
versus
greenwood.
my
point
simply
is
and
i
believe
we
have
traced
it
in
chronological
order
through
the
brief
that
since
hotchkiss
versus
greenwood
right
straight
down
through
the
last
expression
of
this
court
in
a&p
the
rule
has
been
to
determine
patentability
in
a
combination
of
old
elements
case.
the
question
they
rule
has
been
or
the
question
has
been
whether
or
not
the
combination
amounts
to
an
advance
beyond
that
which
would
be
expected
of
a
person
having
ordinary
skill
in
the
art.
and
i
say
that
the
court
if
that's
exactly
what
section
103
says,
there
isn't
there
maybe
some
change
in
the
language
of
it
but
there
cannot
be
any
change
in
the
meaning
of
it.
i
think
all
of
the
circuits
with
the
exception
of
the
second
circuit
and
two
decisions
by
justice
learned
hand
have
reached
that
conclusion
and
i
believe
that
in
following
the
history
of
it
the
position
is
irrefutable
that
that
is
what
section
103
means.
that's
what
congress
said
in
the
committee
reports
and
with
one
or
two
exceptions.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
i
don't
think
the
eighth
circuit
has
said
that
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
--
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
let
me
address
that
very
specific
problem
because
it's
an
excellent
question.
its
--
it
gets
us
down
to
the
heart
of
the
problem.
now,
we
can
free
the
test
any
way
we
want
to
when
you
come
to
apply
to
specific
factual
situations.
as
the
court
said,
as
mr.
justice
jackson
said
in
a&p
case,
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
his
concurring
opinion
there,
as
was
said
in
several
of
the
cases
prior
to
that
time,
when
you
come
to
a
combination
situation
where
there
is
nothing
new,
there
is
no
new
element,
no
new
mechanical
element
and
all
that
is
new
if
there
is
anything
new
is
merely
in
the
arrangement,
the
particular
combination
of
those
mechanical
elements.
then,
how
do
you
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
above
and
beyond
the
expected
skill
the
ordinary
man
having
normal
expected
capacity
in
the
industry.
and
this
court
has
said
when
you
come
to
that
situation
in
lincoln
engineering
for
example
it
said
it's
not
enough
if
all
it
does
is
produce
an
old
result
in
a
more
efficient
way.
and
in
a&p
it
said,
"only,
only
in
that
type
of
case
can
it
amount
to
invention?
can
it
be
an
advance
beyond
the
expected
skill
of
the
art
if
it
does
produce
some
new
unexpected
or
surprising
result
or
consequence,
some
new
unexpected
or
surprising
function
of
a
part
or
combined
functions
of
parts?"
that's
what
the
eighth
circuit
is
saying.
it
is
merely
saying
the
same
thing
this
court
said
in
a&p.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
one
test
of
obviousness
as
applied
to
this
narrow
area,
a
narrow
area
of
a
combination
of
old
elements.
and
if
it
does
produce
a
new
unpredictable,
unexpected
consequence
then
it
may
amount
to
invention.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
i
think
that's
all
the
eighth
circuit
is
saying.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
well,
you
would
have
a
good
question
there,
if
the
arrangement
was
obvious
and
that
might
be
true,
that's
not
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
it
might
produce
a
new
result.
for
example
i
think
in
one
of
the
cases
coming
half
(inaudible)
at
least
there
is
certainly
a
contention
on
the
part
of
the
patentee
that
while
there
wasn't
--
while
the
arrangement
might
have
been
obvious
the
result
was
wholly
unexpected
and
even
unexplainable.
the
experts
don't
even
know
and
it
may
be,
i
don't
know
the
record
in
that
case.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
it
may
be
that
that's
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
is
it?
is
non-obvious
anything
different
from
new?
mr.
s.
tom
morris
does
that
--
does
the
--
do
the
words
which
were
used
in
defining
it
really
mean
anything?
do
they
really
get
us
any
closer
to
solving
the
issue
in
the
given
case
of
whether
or
not
this
is
an
advance
beyond
the
expected
skill
of
the
calling
which
entitles
a
person
to
a
statutory
monopoly?
mr.
s.
tom
morris
synonymous?
not
by
any
means,
your
honor.
certainly
there
can
be
something
noble
in
this
case.
we
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
it
that
the
'798
arrangement
is
noble
in
the
sense
that
you
can't
find
a
picture
of
it
in
the
prior
art.
there
are
some
different
little
arrangements
which
are
spelled
out
with
picture
words
in
the
claims.
and
consequently
since
you
can't
point
to
another
patent
which
shows
it
precisely,
it's
noble
in
the
sense
as
defined
in
section
102
of
the
statute,
we
don't
challenge
that.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
i
would
say
that
is
more
narrow
perhaps
than
is
necessary
to
state
the
rule
of
law.
now,
i
think
that
is
precisely
what
this
court
said
in
a&p.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
well,
it's
a
matter
of
trying
to
apply
the
basic
test
to
the
specific
property.
the
broad
and
basic
test
is
they
expected
something
beyond
the
expected
skill
of
the
calling
as
it's
been
stated
in
the
case
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
--
all
the
way
through
or
as
stated
in
the
statute,
non-obvious.
now
then
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
well,
that
is
entirely
true.
i
think
that's
--
may
be
a
correct
statement
as
applied
to
a
specific
case.
as
mr.
justice
white
posed
a
question
a
moment
ago,
you
may
have
a
situation
where
you
could
say
that
the
arrangement
would
have
been
obvious
to
one
having
skill
in
the
art
yet
the
result
was
unexpected.
that
might
be
true.
in
another
situation,
it
might
be
possible
to
say
that
the
arrangement
or
the
combination
would
be
unobvious
though
it's
rather
difficult
for
me
to
imagine
a
case
of
that
kind
where
you
have
--
where
you're
dealing
with
everyday
stock
of
mechanical
elements.
now,
if
i
may,
let
me
turn
the
court's
attention
to
the
patent
here
in
issue.
i
know
that
this
patent
is
not
of
any
great
national
significance
yet,
nevertheless,
these
questions
must
be
decided
in
the
context
of
the
facts
and
the
patents
before
the
court.
let's
see
what
happened
here.
let's
see
what
the
problem
was
and
what
was
done.
now,
let's
eliminate
a
little
chat
to
before
we
start.
this
is
a
spring
clamp
for
attaching
the
shank
of
a
ground
working
tool
to
the
frame
of
a
plow
so
that
it
may
pivot
under
forces
from
rocks
or
other
obstructions
in
the
soil
and
return
to
operating
position
by
means
of
a
spring.
now,
in
a
simple
language
that's
all
it
is.
now,
the
first
thing
i
want
to
make
absolutely
clear
is
that's
not
new
with
this
fact.
that
goes
back,
that
business
of
a
spring
clamp
or
(inaudible)
resiliently
attaching
a
shank
to
a
--
to
the
frame
of
a
tool
is
at
least
since
1875
that
goes
back
at
least
that
far.
there's
not
any
new
plowing
result
here.
this
is
a
chisel
plow,
chisel
plow
is
a
--
in
a
modern
sense
at
least
go
back
to
1935,
spring
clamps
or
chisel
plows
at
least
go
back
to
1946
or
1947.
so
this
didn't
bring
about
a
new
plowing
result.
it
was
not
a
new
idea
on
a
mounting
of
a
shank.
it
was
not
a
new
spring
clamp
or
a
chisel
plow.
none
of
those
broad
things
were
present
here
or
accomplished
here.
and
in
order
to
define
anything
inventive
or
that
might
even
approach
inventiveness
in
this
case.
we
have
to
come
down
to
the
elements
that
are
involved
in
their
arrangements
and
their
accomplishments.
now,
here
again
let's
eliminate
chat.
it
is
conceded
and
found
that
every
single
mechanical
element
here
is
old
and
that
couldn't
be
--
there
couldn't
be
any
question
about
that
to
at
least
75
years
old
in
this
particular
art.
there
isn't
even
any
contention
or
could
there
be
any
contention
here
that
this
was
the
first
time
all
of
these
elements
had
been
confined
in
a
spring
clamp
or
a
chisel
plow
because
that
had
all
been
done
by
mr.
ralph
in
the
glencoe
clamp
at
least
2
years
earlier
than
mr.
graham
by
stipulation.
so
what
is
it
here?
and
the
only
way
you
can
answer
that
question
i
think
is
to
look
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
the
problem
unless
thus
examined.
mr.
graham
had
an
old
spring
clamp
which
is
called
'811.
working
on
these
plows,
for
these
shanks
and
he
had
some
problems
with
it.
he
had
some
wear
problems
with
it.
he
had
a
rather
unusual
arrangement
in
that
the
shank
pivoted
about
a
point
on
the
heel
of
the
clamp
rather
than
around
its
pivot
pin.
and
also,
he
didn't
have
a
true
fastening
means
to
fasten
his
shank
to
his
hinge
member
so
that
there
was
a
sliding
movement
as
the
thing
worked.
well,
he
had
two
problems
of
wear,
one
at
the
rear
where
the
shank
scrubbed
on
the
butt
of
his
clamp
and
one
at
the
front
where
it
pulled
on
its
spring
rod.
so,
what
did
he
do?
he
set
out
to
solve
that
problem,
those
problems.
he
turned
his
hinge
member
upside
down
and
fastened
it
together
with
a
bolt
at
the
front
and
a
loop
underneath
to
hold
it
up
at
the
rear.
now
that's
what
he
did
and
nothing
else.
you
could
study
this
record
and
you
can
phrase
it
any
way
you
want
to
and
that's
all
you
can
make
of
it.
he
took
these
old
elements
which
were
ready
available
right
there
in
the
art
and
rearrange
them
slightly
and
that's
all.
now,
then
what
did
that
accomplish?
well,
first
of
all
let's
address
ourselves
to
the
obviousness
of
that
questions,
of
the
structure
itself
aside
from
what
happened
to
it.
now,
if
you
have
a
shank
which
pivots
about
a
point
and
it's
rubbing
at
that
point,
what
would
be
the
obvious
and
common
sense
thing
for
anybody
to
do?
it
would
be
to
put
a
pivotal
bearing
there
wouldn't
it
to
eliminate
the
rubbing
contact
instead
of
a
sliding
pivot
to
have
a
full
pivot,
an
ordinary
full
pivot.
that's
what
he
did.
that's
what
the
art
did.
that's
what
we
use
in
all
of
the
art
except
his
own
'811
patent.
and
his
other
problem
was
the
slipping
and
sliding
of
the
shank
and
pulling
on
his
spring
rod
which
caused
to
wear
at
the
front.
but
what
would
be
the
obvious
answer
to
that
if
your
--
if
you
have
a
one
spring
rod
coming
through
here
which
carries
all
this
big
(inaudible)
to
the
--
of
the
shank
if
it
works
back
and
forth
and
that
binds
the
spring
rod
so
that
it
can't
go
up
and
down
as
he
wants
it
to,
to
carry
the
spring
pressure.
what
would
you
do?
what
would
anybody
do?
fasten
them
together
to
take
the
load
off
the
spring
rod.
well
now,
when
he
did
those
two
things
he
accomplished
it
wear
reduction
as
a
relay
to
his
'811
clamp,
his
old
clamp.
yes,
he
improved
his
old
'811
clamp.
he
reduced
some
wear.
but,
that
had
been
fully
accomplished
in
the
glencoe
clamp.
glencoe
had
a
rotating
pivot.
glencoe
had
a
hinge
member
which
did
exactly
that
same
thing.
glencoe
had
fastened
the
shank
to
the
hinge
member
to
take
fully
load
off
the
spring
clamp
before
graham
did.
so,
not
only
did
he
use
the
obvious
aside
from
any
art,
in
addition
to
that,
those
things
were
taught
in
the
very
art
in
which
he
was
working.
now,
i'm
not
overlooking
what
he
now
asserts
in
the
courthouse
as
the
heart
of
his
inventive
concept.
i've
left
that
because
it
must
be
dealt
with
and
it
must
be
destroyed
as
the
eighth
circuit
destroyed
it.
he
says
now
and
this
has
never
raised
or
mentioned
in
the
patent
office.
it's
not
mentioned
in
the
specifications
of
the
patent.
it's
not
mentioned
in
the
(inaudible)
or
history
or
proceedings
before
the
patent
office.
it's
not
mentioned
in
the
claims
but
in
the
courthouse
now
he
says,
"yes,
but
when
i
turned
the
plate
and
shank
upside
down
that
permits
my
shank
to
bend
down
away
from
the
plate
in
this
area
where
it
contacts
the
plate
and
that
makes
a
more
resilient
shock
absorbing
structure
than
i
had
before
and
consequently
that
is
a
new
accomplishment.
that
is
a
significant
consequence
which
entitles
me
to
a
patent."
well
in
the
first
place,
i
think
it's
rather
strange
that
if
that
was
such
an
important
feature,
that
it
would
never
have
been
mentioned
at
all
until
it
got
to
the
courthouse
and
you
can
search
the
record
from
front
to
back
and
that's
--
you
will
see
that
its
never
been
mentioned
until
it
got
to
when
it
got
to
the
courthouse
and
it
also
strikes
me
as
strange
that
that
could
be
relied
upon
as
a
feature
of
importance
to
sustain
this
patent
an
accomplishment
in
advance
beyond
the
expected
skill
of
the
art.
an
unobvious
result
if
you
please,
or
a
non-obvious
structure
if
you
please,
which
would
entitle
him
to
a
patent
when
his
own
expert
says,
“do
you
regard
the
small
degree
of
flex
in
the
in
the
forward
end
of
the
shank
that
lies
between
the
pivot
point
and
the
point
of
spring
attachment
to
be
of
any
significance
or
any
importance
to
the
functioning
of
a
device
such
as
'798?”
answer:
unless
you're
approaching
the
elastic
limit
i
think
the
flexing
will
reduce
the
maximum
stress
at
the
point
of
pivot
there
where
the
maximum
stress
does
occur.
i
think
it
were
reduced
that,
i
don't
know
how
much.
question:
do
you
think
it
is
a
substantial
factor,
a
factor
of
importance
in
the
functioning
of
the
structure?
answer:
not
a
great
factor,
no.
and
in
the
jeffrey
case
which
had
been
tried
sometime
earlier
a
similar
testimony
was
given
and
is
also
reported
in
this
record
that
you
consider
this
portion
that
you
call
a
resilient
action
of
the
shank
mr.
fenton
in
the
forward
8
or
9
inches
that's
up
inside
the
mounting
of
the
bracket
important
to
the
function
of
the
device?
answer:
not
to
important.
it's
present
but
it's
not
too
important.
question:
it
would
function
just
as
well
whether
that
were
there
or
not,
wouldn't
it?
answer:
in
this
particular
case
of
this
device,
yes,
sir.
question:
i
think
it
would
essentially,
yes.
so,
this
great
important
thing
that's
been
the
advance
beyond
the
art
now
even
it's
own
expert
says
it's
unimportant.
well
now,
looking
at
this
device
in
summation
of
what
was
done
and
what
was
accomplished.
it
didn't
change
the
way
it
plowed.
it
didn't
the
way
it
pivoted
except
that
it
pivoted
around
the
bearing
instead
of
a
point.
it
didn't
change
the
action
of
the
shank.
it
didn't
change
the
plowing
result.
it
didn't
change
the
main
body
of
the
clamp.
it
didn't
change
the
springs.
it
didn't
change
anything
except
the
relative
position
of
the
shank
and
the
hinge
member
and
the
fastening
means
and
that's
all.
now,
if
that
be
an
invention,
if
that
be
an
advance
which
any
court
will
say
would
entitle
a
man
to
a
17-year
monopoly
then
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
gone
up
long
way
down
the
road
of
destroying
any
validity
of
the
patent
system.
now,
let
me
turn
my
attention
or
if
i
may
to
the
history
of
this
litigation
just
a
bit.
of
course,
we
recognize
that
we
have
here
former
decisions
of
the
fifth
circuit
upholding
this
patent
twice.
but
i
don't'
think
there
can
be
any
doubt
whatsoever
about
the
basis
of
validity
in
the
fifth
circuit.
you
can
search
both
opinions
in
the
first
of
the
jeffrey
cases
and
in
hotchkiss
case
both
of
which
i
have
set
out
the
--
in
principle
part
in
the
brief
to
find
the
basis
for
the
holding
of
validity
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
you
can
come
up
with
only
conclusion.
and
that
is
that
the
patent
was
sustained
in
the
fifth
circuit
because
it
produced
as
it
thought
a
more
efficient
and
more
economic
result.
listen
to
these
words.
it
still
seems
to
us
that
it's
hybrid
type
structure
combining
the
wear
resisting
rotating
pivot
in
part
reminiscent
of
the
prior
art
with
a
new
shank
and
stirrup
arrangements
permitting
some
of
the
same
advantageous
flexibility
inherent
of
the
old
'811
structure
reveals
sufficient
indicia
of
novelty
and
invention
to
justify
limited
protection.
the
further
rule
and
this
is
the
only
place
you
can
find
anything
that
looks
like
a
rule
in
that
opinion.
the
further
rule
along
recognized
by
this
court
that
an
improvement
combination
is
patentable
even
though
its
constituent
elements
are
singularly
revealed
by
the
prior
art
where
as
here
it
produces
an
old
result
in
a
cheaper
and
otherwise
more
advantageous
way.
and
if
that
weren't
enough
to
establish
what
the
real
rule
is,
look
on
to
the
hotchkiss
case
which
followed
some
three
years
later
and
the
court
said
this,
“it
is
only
because
this
particular
arrangement
of
these
known
elements
adopted
by
graham
achieves
the
result
better
than
the
prior
art
afforded,
better
than
the
prior
art
afforded
that
graham
was
entitled
to
a
patent.”
that's
the
rule
in
the
fifth
circuit.
there
was
no
attempt
to
follow
the
statute.
there
was
no
attempt
to
apply
the
rule
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
they
didn't
say
anything
at
all
about
it.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
well,
was
there
any
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
your
honor,
was
there
any
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
i
don't
quite
understand.
well,
no,
sir.
your
honor,
that's
not
true.
as
i
construe
the
opinions.
in
the
first
place,
you
will
not
find
any
attempt
in
the
fifth
circuit
to
apply
any
standard
of
the
statute
or
prior
cases
or
anything
except
its
own
old
standard
of
a
better
result
or
any
improved
result.
now,
let
me
turn
quickly
to
this
problem
that
you're
pointing
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
that's
exactly
what
i've
said.
i
believe
that's
the
way
i
read
it
and
i
say
that's
wrong.
now
that
doesn't
call
anybody's
test.
it
doesn't
call
it
a
test
laid
down
by
this
court
or
by
the
statute
or
any
other
test.
it's
the
only
circuit
that
i
know
anything
about
that
says
that,
"a
better
result
alone
is
now
enough,
is
enough."
it's
only
court
i
know
off
that
says
such
a
rule
as
that.
now
turning
to
the
eighth
circuit,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
square
and
true
and
complete
holding
of
the
eighth
circuit
and
let's
not
take
it
the
tidbits
to
find
out
what
the
true
context
is.
here
is
what
the
court
said,
“furthermore,
even
assuming
that
the
trial
court's
finding
of
a
slight
but
significant
difference
in
the
flexing
of
the
forward
portion
of
the
shank,
that
is
not
found
in
the
prior
art
can
be
construed
as
a
finding
of
a
new
result.
the
court's
further
finding,
now
if
the
court
followed
this,
the
court's
further
finding
that
patent
'798
exhibits
invention
and
would
not
have
been
obvious
to
a
person
having
ordinary
skill
in
the
art
is
clearly
erroneous.
the
alleged
patentable
difference
between
the
'798
structure
and
the
prior
art
lies
in
the
arrangement
in
the
'798
structure
of
the
shank
below
the
plate
of
the
pivoted
member
permitting
the
shank
to
flex
throughout
it's
link
and
particularly
permitting
the
forward
portion
of
the
shank
to
flex
downwardly
away
from
the
plate
theoretically.
and
listen
to
this,
theoretically,
at
least,
when
the
plate
is
below
the
shank
as
in
the
prior
art
there
is
a
tendency
of
the
shank
to
bend
against
the
plate
and
when
the
plate
is
above
as
in
'798
there
is
a
tendency
of
the
shank
to
bend
away
from
the
plate.
and
let
me
stop
there
and
direct
our
attention
to
the
question
again
of
obviousness
under
the
statute.
if
the
plate
lies
underneath
the
shank
in
the
prior
art
and
the
shank
bends
downwardly
against
the
plate,
what
will
happen
if
you
change
the
positions
and
move
the
plate
above
retaining
a
fulcrum
point
above
as
is
was
done.
what's
going
to
happen?
which
way
can
it
be
in?
the
only
way
and
the
obvious
way
is
it
will
now
been
away
from
the
plate
instead
of
toward
it,
is
that
predictable?
is
that
the
expected?
is
that
what
any
high
school
physic
student
would
say
would
happen?
by
any
imagination
can
that
be
construed
as
an
unexpected
structure
or
an
unexpected
result
an
unobvious
things?
let's
finish
then
with
what
the
eighth
circuit
said
about
this
fact.
but
it's
this
difference,
they
pointed
out
the
difference
in
the
bending.
but
is
this
difference
significant
enough
to
support
the
patent.
we
think
not.
painstaking
examination
of
the
entire
record
including
the
testimony
of
the
experts
convinces
us
that
the
changes
in
the
prior
art
and
the
'798
involved
only
the
application
and
mechanical
ability.
there's
no
adequate
evidentiary
support
for
the
court's
findings
and
going
on
that
says
and
would
have
been
obvious
to
a
person
having
ordinary
skill
in
the
art.
let
me
sum
up
by
bringing
in
some
other
ancillary
things.
frequently,
if
a
case
is
a
closed
case
the
court's
rely
upon
these
make
weights,
i
call
them
validity
crutches
in
the
brief.
such
thing
as
commercial
excess
--
success,
a
long
felt
want,
inability
of
others
to
solve
the
problem,
immediate
solving
of
the
problem
by
this
device,
immediate
copying
and
adoption
by
others,
none
of
which
are
present
in
this
case.
graham
has
never
manufactured
or
sold
this
device
at
all
or
regardless
of
what
he
says
about
his
merits.
and
all
these
years
he's
never
done
it.
there,
the
only
commercial
success
was
commercial
success
achieved
by
jeffrey
manufacturing
company
who
are
only
--
market
with
their
device
more
than
a
year
prior
to
the
time
this
patent
even
issued.
there's
no
finding
of
any
copying
in
this
case
by
anybody.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
only
way
that
there
was
a
finding
of
infringement
in
the
trial
court
was
upon
adoption
of
equivalence
not
because
the
claim
to
the
patent
could
be
read
upon
these
devices.
there's
no
evidence
of
any
long
felt
want
here
when
the
problem
arose.
it
was
solved
immediately
by
some
sketching
and
the
filing
of
a
patent
application.
there's
no
evidence
here
of
any
long
experimentation
or
wrestling
with
a
tough
problem
that
just
didn't
exist.
i
say
to
the
court
that
this
patent
represents
a
derelict
which
the
eighth
circuit
after
a
full
and
careful
review
has
said
is
not
entitled
to
stand.
and
under
the
record,
the
undisputed
facts
in
this
case,
the
achievement
of
this
device
if
there
is
any
at
all
is
so
nominal
and
so
clear
and
would
have
been
so
obvious
to
even
a
high
school
physics
student
that
its
simply
is
not
entitled
to
a
statutory
monopoly
for
17
years
or
any
other
years.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
your
honor,
i
think
you
will
find
in
the
record
several
brochures
and
so
on
that
are
in
the
fifth
volume.
there
are
some
pictures
probably
in
there
although
i
can't
put
my
hand
on
any
right
off
the
bat.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
yes,
sir,
i
certainly
can
very
easily.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
plain
and
simply
as
i
know
how
your
honor.
the
plow
is
what's
called
a
chisel
plow.
it
consist
of
a
mobile
frame,
in
other
words,
a
frame
mounted
wheels
drawn
by
a
tractor.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
always
drawn
by
a
tractor
in
modern
times
although
it
could
be
small
enough
for
horses
i
suppose
but
a
tractor.
it
has
multiple
cross
beams
to
which
a
multiple
ground
working
spring
shanks
are
attached.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
it
has
three
of
them.
generally
speaking
there
is
--
the
plow
is
drawn
this
way
by
the
tractor.
it
has
two
or
three
cross
beams
or
transverse
beams,
transverse
the
direction
of
how
this
plow
travels
and
on
these
beams
that's
the
frame
of
the
plow.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
that's
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
all
the
beams
are
mounted
that
shanks
that
come
back
and
curve
and
work
the
soil.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
that's
a
tie
--
that's
not
the
precise
one
your
honor
that's
a
forerunner.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
well,
i
think
if
you
look
at
page
5
--
819
you'll
see
a
picture
of
the
jeffrey
plow
which
is
as
substantially
similar
plow
or
there's
a
brochure
there
showing
the
arrangements.
818
and
819,
your
honor,
there
are
pictures
there.
also
821.
so
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
not
the
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
not
a
complete
--
my
definition
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
alright.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
now
then
we
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
that's
the
old-fashioned
plow
except
the
reason
this
is
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
excuse
me.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
oh,
that's
a
--
generally
speaking,
these
plow
has
used
what's
called
a
chisel
point
and
that's
where
the
name
chiseling
comes
from.
it's
a
sharp
type
of
tool
that
is
designed
to
penetrate
the
ground
and
go
through
and
break
the
hard
pan
or
supposed
to.
now
that's
the
ground
working
element.
but
the
heart
of
this
lawsuit
now
is
not
that
plow,
that's
an
ancient
thing.
the
heart
of
this
lawsuit
is
the
clamps
which
attach
those
ground
working
elements
to
the
frame.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
alright.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
would
pivot,
that's
correct.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
right.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
but
your
honor,
let
me
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
may
i
interrupt
you
because
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
--
you're
leaving
out
a
crucial
and
important
step.
this
manufacturer
devising
of
a
spring
clam
to
do
that
job
that
is
to
let
shank
pivot
and
return
to
action
is
old.
it
wasn't
done
first
with
graham
in
this
patent.
it
was
--
has
been
done
for
years.
it
was
done
in
an
earlier
graham
patent
as
applied
to
earlier
plows
in
1947.
it
was
done
by
a
jeffrey.
it
was
done
by
other
people.
so
this
patent
involves
merely
an
improvement
of
a
prior
spring
clamp
which
performed
that
job.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
i
think
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
your
honor,
if
you
can
search
this
record
and
find
any
testimony
in
the
record
which
will
show
you
anything
that
it
does
other
than
this
little
reduction
and
wear
and
other
than
this
so-called
difference
in
the
flexing
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
the
difference
is
that
it
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
at
all
when
a
farmer
gets
hold
of
that,
it's
immaterial.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
the
difference
is
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
sir?
mr.
s.
tom
morris
well,
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
not
any.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
nothing.
not
only
that,
i
defy
that
it
even
exist
beyond
such
an
infinitesimal
amount
that
it's
not
even
measurable,
some
efforts
were
made
to
measure
the
thing.
these
shanks
swing
back
12-13
inches
when
they're
coming
clear
of
those
rocks.
the
flex
that
they're
talking
about
in
the
shank,
the
maximum
that
anybody
has
been
able
to
measure
it
is
about
35,000ths
of
an
inch,
35,000ths
of
an
inch.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
35,000ths
of
an
inch
away
from
this
pivoted
member
different
from
what
it
was
before.
that's
it.
a
farmer
would
never
know
any
thing
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
your
honor,
you
can
search
this
record
and
that's
all
there
is,
that's
all
the
trial
court
found
as
a
basis
to
support
this
patent.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
oh,
the
advantage
and
the
only
advantage
is
one
which
is
the
figment
of
counsel's
imagination
and
that
is
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
he'll
find
none
your
honor
and
it's
never
been
proven
that
there
is
any
by
any
farmer.
there's
no
farmer
anywhere
has
ever
testified
that
it
does
anything.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
the
fifth
circuit
says
it
reduces
wear?
mr.
s.
tom
morris
i
believed
mr.
justice
reed
wrote
that
opinion
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
--
who
brought
the
first
opinions?
mr.
s.
tom
morris
you've
got
me,
i
don't
remember.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
well,
that's
just
--
your
honor,
you're
assuming
something
that
hasn't
been
decided
and
that
is
that
we
want
to
use
it.
we
say
to
you
that
when
we
came
to
design
our
clamp
the
patent
had
been
issued.
we
didn't
copy
that
clamp.
we
deliberately
set
about
to
design
around
that
patent.
we
made
a
careful
search.
everything
was
done
was
carefully
checked
and
tested.
we
studied
this
patent
to
determine
what
its
heart
was
and
we
avoided
that
patent.
now,
the
trial
court
found
that
we
infringed.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
the
eighth
circuit
and
reach
that
point.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
well,
your
honor
that's
another
long,
long
story.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
you
see
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
well,
they're
really
not.
let
me
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
so
let
me
call
to
your
attention
something
that
is
--
well,
this
could
go
forever
and
i've
already
used
my
time
but
the
court's
question
goes
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
well,
let
me
read
you
what
the
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
let
me
read
to
you
what
the
claim
itself
says
about
the
relationship
of
this
pivoted
member
and
this
shank.
and
i'm
coming
down
to
the
element
that
element,
the
one
element
where
it
would
be.
claim
one
says,
means
connecting
the
elongated
plate
portion
that's
the
hinge
member
with
the
shank
for
maintaining
the
upper
phase
of
the
shank
in
constant
continuous
contact
with
the
under
phase
of
said
plate
portion
of
the
shank
attaching
members.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
for
maintaining
constant
continuous
contact
with
the
under
phase
of
said
plate
portion
of
the
shank
attaching
member.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
that's
what
it
means
to
me
your
honor
it
says,
connect
means
connecting
for
a
constant,
continuous
contact.
mr.
s.
tom
morris
that's
the
bolt
and
--
mr.
s.
tom
morris
--
the
stirrup
at
the
rear
through
which
the
shank
passes.
and
yet
here
that's
what
the
claim
says
yet
the
argument
is
that
the
secret
to
it,
the
heart
of
the
improvement
is
that
it
bends
away
from
it.
here
it
says
means
maintaining
constant,
continuous
contact.
i've
more
than
used
my
time
and
i
hope
i
haven't
exhausted
the
court's
patience.
