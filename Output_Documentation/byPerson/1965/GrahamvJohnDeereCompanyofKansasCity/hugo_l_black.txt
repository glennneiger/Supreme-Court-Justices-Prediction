justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
understand
you
that
in
the
beginning
it
might
have
been
just,
don't
do
it.
if
you
could
state
what
state
succinctly
what
you
claim
proper
standard
is
and
what
change
you
claim
the
eighth
circuit
has
made
in
the
standards?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
that
is
the
one
you
claim
is
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
(inaudible)
--
you
stated
as
i
understand
it
that
if
the
court
would
charged
a
jury
to
try
the
patents
to
--
that
the
quotation
you
gave
from
the
opinion
930
would
be
an
improper
instruction
that
wouldn't
give
the
correct
standards.
and
do
you
have
anywhere
in
writing
of
--
when
you've
given
it
succinctly
what
you
say
would
be
a
proper
charge
instead
of
that
far
standard?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
which
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
an
early
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
when
they
thought
--
when
they
--
that's
tried
before
the
jury
or
the
court
without
a
jury
and
goes
up
to
the
appellate
court
in
passing
on
it,
what
does
that
court,
this
--
that
--
can
that
court
just
say,
"we
find
and
it
does
not
meet
the
standard."
they
were
wrong
if
the
evidence
didn't
support
it.
and
therefore
we
set
them
aside.
that
would
be
the
final
standard
you
would
suggest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words
(inaudible)
--
your
position
here,
the
final
or
when
you
have
subsidiary
crimes
and
when
you
get
down
to
the
ultimate
question
of
whether
it's
tangible
that
is
the
true
question
of
law?

justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
the
picture
of
the
plow
or
the
equipment
any
where,
i'm
not
talking
about
this
map,
this
diagram
in
its
application
of
a
patent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
now
that
both
of
you've
argued
it,
would
you
mind
telling
me
in
in
plain
layman's
language
if
you
can
exactly
what
the
plow
was
before
and
what
the
it
became
afterwards?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
according
to
any
artistic
language
used
in
giving
the
patent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
always
drawn
by
a
tractor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
multiple
cross
beams
and
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
frame
and
all
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
beams
are
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
--
that's
what
goes
in
the
soil,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
now
you
call
us
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
brought
us
down
to
where
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(inaudible)
in
the
--
down
underneath
in
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
things
that
go
in
the
ground.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
old-fashioned
plow?
justice
hugo
l.
black
down
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
down
where
the
thing,
it
goes
in
the
ground.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now
you've
--
we've
got
the
plow,
that's
the
way
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
--
their
claim
of
improvement
is
that
they
--
as
i
understand
it,
because
--
see
if
i'm
wrong
and
when
the
old
plow
would
get
in
a
rock
or
something
that's
covered,
it
wouldn't
factually,
it
wouldn't
give
like
it
should.
is
that
the
idea,
it
wouldn't
give?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
wanted
to
discover
some
way
to
make
it
give
and
work
some
way
to
make
it
give
so
that
it
move
over.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what's
been
done
here
as
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
yes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
it
--
make
it
give
that?
what
does
it
do
layman's
language
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can't
understand
it,
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what's
the
difference
in
the
flexing,
is
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
--
when
the
farmer
gets
hold
of
this,
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
it
flex
to
a
35,000ths
of
an
inch
difference.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that's
all
the
difference
in
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now
what
advantages
does
the
farmer
get
out
of
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
he's
not
a
farmer.
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
the
farmer
is
(voice
overlap)
--
what
this
farmer
is
looking
at
it,
reusing
it
would
find,
he
had
a
benefit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the
fifth
circuit
says
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
wrote
that
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
wrote
the
second?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
the
trial
court
find
you
infringed
and
why?
and
why
do
you
say
that's
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
want
to
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
claims
are
too
long
for
me
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
want
to
get
a
lot
of
time.
i
just
wanted
to
see
if
i
can
get
a
picture
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
the
thing
and
it
did
and
what
it
didn't
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
will
do
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
means
all
of
that,
what
is
--
does
that
mean
fastened
it
--
to
it
somewhere?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
the
--
you
mean
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
wasn't
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
they
made
the
survey,
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
the
eighth
circuit
have
decided
in
favor
to
that
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
of
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
of
your
18
points
that
set
out
in
your
brief
at
one
page
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page?
is
there
one
page
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
from
the
argument
maybe
you
might
have
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
is
yours?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
--
was
that
calmar
have
sold
a
business
or
was
he
engaged
in
the
businesses
of
selling
the
fluid
in
the
bottle?
justice
hugo
l.
black
plastic
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
would
not
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
leak
or
break?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
--
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
finding
to
which
you
refer
part
of
the
court's
opinion?
i
just
want
to
look
at
it
if
it
won't
bother
you.
if
this
bothers
you,
i'll
find
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
part
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
that
just
a
--
you
consider
the
most
valuable
part
of
it
--
the
leakage
problem
that
they
solve
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
lack
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
leakage
and
breakage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
question
that
disturbed
me
a
little.
you
--
you
gave
18
guideposts
which
maybe
all
relevant.
but
does
that
not
indicate
to
some
extent
that
it's
impossible
to
capture
one
single
formula
in
the
short
series
of
words
that
will
allow
us
to
say,
“this
is
it?”
isn't
it
something
like
negligence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
just
about
a
--
isn't
it
a
matter
of
judgment
after
all
on
what
you've
said
considering
all
of
these
and
maybe
18
more
or
36
more
factors
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
whether
it
actually
reaches
the
standard
which
is
practically
impossible
of
definition.
