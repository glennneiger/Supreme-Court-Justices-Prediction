ms.

chief
justice
earl
warren
had
the
--
had
the
captain
taken
out
of
the
license
in
any
state
ms.
maier?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
what
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
trial
was
it
ms.
maier?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
that
have
been
a
cadillac
what
would
be
--
what
was
the
license
fee
had
been?
chief
justice
earl
warren
market
value.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
this
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
supreme
court
has
--
has
determined
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
that
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wasn't
this
tax
--
wasn't
this
registration
fee
fixed
in
lieu
--
in
lieu
of
the
property
taxes
in
the
counties
(voice
overlap)
and
don't
they
now
return
a
certain
amount
of
this
--
of
this
fee
to
the
counties
in
lieu
of
the
counties
letting
any
ad
valorem
tax?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
you
do
--
you
do
sub
--
sub
grant
this
money
much
of
it
to
the
counties,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
counties
do
not
have
any
personal
property
tax
on
automobiles
at
all?
do
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
then
it
is
to
that
extent
an
ad
valorem
tax,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
like
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
was
there
when
the
--
i
was
there
when
the
counties
levied
an
ad
valorem
tax
on
automobiles
as
personal
property
and
they
were
very
difficult
for
the
counties
to
levy
this
tax
that
automobiles
are
moving
all
over,
they
couldn't
catch
them.
and
so,
they
went
to
the
legislature,
as
i
recall
it,
and
the
legislature
incorporated
their
ad
valorem
tax
into
the
registration
taxes
with
the
state
court
and
then
the
state
collected
back
the
amount
of
money
that
the
counties
would
have
--
would
have
received
on
an
ad
valorem
basis,
am
i
wrong
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
just
wondering
if
this
is
really
just
a
license
tax
or
whether
it
is
also
an
ad
valorem
tax
like
the
mississippi
one
where
they
have
to
pay
the
ad
valorem
tax
in
order
to
get
the
registration
certificate.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
cross
reference
between
the
vehicle
code
and
the
revenue
and
taxation
code
which
says
that
the
--
the
so-called
fee
in
--
in
the
revenue
code
shall
be
included
in
the
motor
vehicle
license
fee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
isn't
any
cross
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
sure
that
is
the
practice.
i
just
wonder
where
they
derive
that,
where
they
derive
their
authority
to
do
that
because
it's
done
--
had
been
done
ever
since
that
it
was
revenue
and
taxation
effects
and
came
in
to
being.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
yes,
i
understand.

justice
