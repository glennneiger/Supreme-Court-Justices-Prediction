am
i
right
in
understanding
that
there's
no
mention
to
this
point
in
your
brief
or
in
california's
brief
or
in
government's
amicus
brief
or
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
california?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
mention
of
this
point
in
the
supreme
court's
opinion
of
california,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
through
that
because
of
the
impact
of
the
federal
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i'm
now
reading
to
the
court's
opinion.
his
defense
was
that
the
section
4000
did
not
applied
to
him
because
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act
1940
and
the
supreme
court
of
california
goes
on
to
this
--
discussed
that
contention
and
eventually
they
agree
with
it
and
that's
the
reason
which
they
found
that
he
was
not
guilty.
