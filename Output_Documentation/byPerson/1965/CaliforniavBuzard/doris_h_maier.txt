ms.
doris
h.
maier
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
which
is
a
companion
case
to
snap
is
whether
a
nonresident
serviceman
having
a
permanent
duty
station
in
california
is
authorized
to
operate
his
motor
vehicle
on
california
highways
without
the
payment
of
the
california
fees
when
he
has
paid
no
fees
to
his
resident
state
but
the
privilege
of
operating
this
vehicle.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no.
your
honor,
the
california
court,
the
supreme
court
answered
this
question
in
the
affirmative
basing
its
decision
on
the
provisions
that
section
574
subdivision
2
in
finding
that
the
fee
in
the
state
of
washington
was
not
required
until
he
drove
on
the
highways.
they
so
interpreted
the
word
“require”
to
mean
that
it
was
not.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
this
is
so.
there
is
no
separate
registration
fee
as
registration
and
license
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
that
is
correct.
now,
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes.
if
i
will
give
you
the
factors
your
honor
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
--
now
you'll
take
out
the
license
in
alabama.
captain
buzard
in
1957
was
recalled
to
active
duty
with
the
air
force,
he
was
a
resident
of
the
state
of
washington.
he
was
assigned
as
a
permanent
duty
station
as
his
duty
station
to
castle
air
force
base
in
california.
in
september
of
1959,
he
was
then
held
to
an
office
--
squadron
offices
training
school
in
alabama
for
temporary
duty.
while
in
alabama,
he
purchased
a
demonstrative
car
on
which
the
license
and
fees
have
been
paid.
the
license
plates
there
were
valid
until
september
of
1960.
at
the
completion
of
his
temporary
duty
at
the
end
of
december
in
1959,
he
drove
this
car
back
to
california.
early
or
rather
late
in
february
of
1960,
he
was
stopped
by
the
california
highway
patrol
rejecting
out
of
state
licenses.
they
questioned
him
about
this
alabama
license.
he
then
went
to
the
motor
vehicle
department
in
california
to
discuss
registration
and
payment
of
the
fees.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
he
discussed
registration
and
the
payment
of
the
fees
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
--
at
the
--
he
did
not,
however,
pay
either
the
registration
or
license
fee.
thereafter,
a
citation
was
given
him
and
a
complaint
filed
and
a
4000
of
the
california
vehicle
code.
in
the
summer,
in
private
trial
of
case,
he
did
get
to
state
of
washington
and
registered
his
vehicle
in
there.
however,
after
the
complaint
was
filed,
the
defendant
demurred
has
sought
to
hold
trial
by
writ
of
prohibition.
this
order
was
denied
and
the
denial
affirmed
by
our
district
court
of
appeal
in
the
case
of
buzard
versus
justice
court
then
the
trial
was
held
and
petitioner
--
respondent
was
convicted
of
the
misdemeanor
to
register
and
pay
the
license
required.
he
was
sentenced
to
a
fine
which
the
judgment
was
suspended.
on
appeal
to
the
superior
court,
the
matter
was
then
certified
under
california
rules
because
of
the
constitutional
questions
involved
to
the
district
court
of
appeals
which
affirmed
to
judgment.
a
timely
petition
for
hearing
with
the
california
supreme
court
was
filed
and
the
california
supreme
court
reversed
its
judgment
and
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
amount
involved
--
you
mean
the
amount
of
the
fine,
your
honor?this
is
a
criminal
statute.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
oh,
the
basic
licensing?
ms.
doris
h.
maier
would
have
been
approximately
$100.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
there
would
have
been
initially
about
a
dollar
difference
between
the
total
fee
in
california
and
washington.
but
the
principle
involved
is
that
involving
interpretation
of
the
proviso
to
the
soldiers
and
sailors
relief
act
contained
in
subdivision.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
it
was
an
automobile
'58,
'59,
suppose
1959.
ms.
doris

it
would
have
been
depended

of
the
market
value
of
the
car.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
but
the
california
tax,
your
honor,
has
been
characterized
by
the
california
court,
as
a
privilege
tax.
in
ingels
versus
riley,
5
cal.2d
154,
the
court
stated,
“we
have
no
hesitancy
in
declaring
that
the
charge
involved
is
one
imposed
and
only
for
the
motor
vehicles
for
the
privilege
of
using
the
highways
of
the
state
and
is
not
in
nature
a
property
tax”.
again,
at
page
161
of
that
opinion,
the
court
stated,
“in
addition
to
the
characterization
of
the
charge
in
the
statute
as
a
privilege
tax
and
examination
of
the
terms
of
the
act
plainly
indicates
that
the
charge
is
an
excise
for
the
privilege
of
using
the
highways
and
not
a
tax
on
motor
vehicles
as
personal
property.
ms.
doris

that
is
(voice

ms.
doris
h.

that
is
true.
ms.
doris

your

it
is
fixed
on

that
it's
a

ms.
doris

no.
this
is

ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
your
honor
it
would
be
an
ad

tax
to
the
extent
of
basic
value.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
to
the
extent
its
basic
value
but
basically
the
tax
is
a
privilege
tax
though
it
may
be
measured
by
the
value.
it's
still
is
a
privilege
tax
for
the
use
of
highways
of
the
state.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
i
--
i
don't
believe
you
are,
your
honor.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
we
--
there
is
no
question
that
they
have
to
pay
this
tax
in
order
to
register
the
cost.
but
california
has
characterized
it
as
a
privilege
tax
because
there
is
a
difference.
in
this
tax,
if
you
only
use
or
attain
your
car
certain
months
of
the
year
and
used
the
highways,
then
the
tax
is
lowered
depending
on
the
use
of
the
highway.
for
example,
if
it
were
only
10
months,
you
would
not
pay
the
total
12
months
tax
but
just
the
period
of
10
months.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
--
that
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
this
--
your
honor
as
i
understand,
this
court
has
the
ultimate
right
to
determine
the
nature
of
any
tax
regardless
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
under
the
exemption
provision
of
the
federal
statute
that
is
too
big.
the
term
“taxation”
shall
include
but
not
be
limited
to
licensees'
fees
or
excises
imposed
in
respect
to
motor
vehicles
with
their
use
thereof.
now,
regardless
to
the
category
of
tax
that
before
within
that
but
our
--
our
disagreement
with
the
state
--
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
has
been
based
in
their
interpretation
of
the
proviso.
they
have
read
it
so
that
unless
the
charge
is
actually
levied
on
the
respondent,
he
would
be
not
subject
to
the
charge
of
the
state
in
which
he
was
stationed.
we
believe
that
this
interpretation
of
the
soldiers
and
sailors
relief
act
is
erroneous
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
exempt
servicemen
from
the
payment
of
registration
and
license
fees
all
over
the
united
states,
because,
virtually
all
of
the
motor
vehicle
provisions
in
there
--
of
the
various
states
are
depended
on
the
use
of
the
highway
and
that
the
fee
only
comes
actually
into
force
when
the
use
is
made
of
the
particular
highway
of
that
state.
and
therefore,
we
say
that
congress
when
it
enacted
this
proviso
was
well
aware
of
this
provision
and
the
provisions
of
this
state
statutes
only
met
to
exempt
servicemen
who
were
--
had
already
paid
the
motor
vehicle
fee
charged
in
the
resident
state.
under
our
interpretation,
the
term
“required”
as
used
in
the
act
means
that
this
established
or
charged
by
the
resident
state.
the
fact
that
the
washington
statute
provided
that
the
motor
vehicle
fees
were
not
payable
until
the
vehicle
was
operated
upon
the
state's
highways,
we
say,
does
not
compel
a
contrary
view.
for
vehicle
fees
generally
are
considered
a
privilege
tax
and
not
due
and
payable
until
the
vehicle
was
operating
within
the
taxing
state.
the
statute
in
the
various
states
had
been
set
forth
in
appendix
a
to
petitioner's
brief.
we
believe
that
whiting
versus
the
city
of
portsmouth
the
virginia
case,
it
has
reasoning
that
it's
applicable
to
this.
in
that
case,
the
servicemen
stationed
in
virginia
was
a
resident
in
colorado,
purchased
a
car
in
virginia,
paid
his
registration
and
license
fees
in
virginia.
he
claimed
exemption
from
the
city
of
portsmouth's
tax
which
taxed
the
motor
vehicle
operating,
kept
and
use
in
the
city.
the
court
there
held
that
the
imposition
of
the
portsmouth
tax
was
proper
since
he
had
not
paid
the
taxes
levied
by
his
home
state
of
colorado.
subsequent
to
this
case,
congress
did
amend,
section
574
of
the
soldiers
and
sailor's
relief
act
but
did
not
in
any
way
change
the
proviso.
therefore,
we
plea
that
under
the
general
provisions
of
statutory
construction
it
may
be
presumed
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
judicial
decision
and
intended
to
leave
that
construction
of
statute
the
unchanged.
we
would
call
the
attention
of
this
court
to
the
fact
that
the
california
supreme
court's
decision
would
place
in
virtually
impossible
burden
on
the
administrative
agencies
whose
duty
is
to
carry
out
these
statutes.
the
administrative
agency
would
have
to
determine
in
the
case
of
each
serviceman
what
the
law
of
his
home
state
requires
and
whether
he
had
complied
with
that
prior
to
granting
or
denying
an
exemption
from
the
california
statutes.
we
submit
that
this
should
be
replaced
by
what
we
believe
was
the
--
an
objective
standard
adopted
by
congress
namely
whether
he
had
paid
the
tax
in
his
home
state
or
license
in
his
home
state
prior
to
being
exempted
by
the
state
in
which
he
was
stationed.
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
would
further
render
effective,
motor
vehicle
registration
statutes
because
we
would
have
no
provision
for
a
serviceman
registering
and
paying
his
fees
if
he
did
not
have
to
pay
in
the
state
where
he
was
stationed
where
perhaps
he
would
not
go
back
to
his
home
state
and
operate
his
vehicle
on
the
roads
of
that
state.
safety
dictates
that
motor
vehicles
should
be
registered
for
purposes
of
proper
identification
in
case
of
accidents
or
injuries
to
occupants
and
also
in
order
to
protect
innocent
purchasers.
if
a
car
is
ineffectively
licensed,
it
is
not
only
tempting
to
car
theft,
thief
but
becomes
a
public
hazard
in
case
of
an
accident.
we
submit
that
it
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
to
completely
eliminate
servicemen
from
liability
for
fees
for
the
use
of
the
highways
of
the
state.
the
problems
presented
by
the
respondent
that
the
servicemen
would
encounter
if
he
were
subject
to
tax
of
states
are
not
correctly
set
forth.
petitioner,
respondent,
pardon
me,
in
this
case
had
he
pay
the
license
and
tax
charged
by
his
home
state,
would
have
been
exempt
from
the
provisions
of
all
other
state
statutes.
he
then
would
have
a
necessary
license
and
been
able
to
travel
throughout
the
states
without
the
problems
here
presented
arising.
also,
a
temporary
as
the
respondent
has
raised
the
question
of
the
burden
that
might
be
placed
on
the
servicemen
going
through
numerous
states
that
each
state
would
levy
a
tax.
this
is
not
correct,
because
each
state
has
a
provision
for
the
temporary
use
of
its
highways
without
the
payment
of
any
fees
by
nonresident.
we
request
that
this
court
should
reverse
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
if
it
please
your
honor.
first,
let
us
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
points
now
raised
by
the
respondent
were
not
raised
throughout
the
california
courts
that
the
california
codes
are
to
be
read
together
both
the
vehicle
and
the
revenue
and
taxation
code
of
california
has
read
all
its
code
is
one
portion
of
its
statutory
law.
that
in
the
california
proceedings
throughout
from
the
time
of
the
demurrer
throughout
to
the
california
supreme
court,
the
respondent
here
at
no
point
has
questioned
the
jurisdiction
as
to
section
4000.
it
has
--
the
respondent
here
has
claimed
that
he
was
without
the
provisions
of
section
6701
of
the
california
vehicle
code
through
the
application
of
section
574
to
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
relief
act.
and
we
believe
that
this
case
is
properly
before
this
court
insofar
as
petitioner
was
properly
convicted
and
the
sole
reason
for
the
california
supreme
court
reversing
his
conviction
was
that
at
least
it
was
foreclosed
from
so
doing
under
the
provisions
of
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
relief
act
and
not
because
of
any
question
involved
as
to
the
--
whether
petitioner
was
charged
under
the
correct
step.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
section
4000
is
--
you
can
see
in
the
petitioner's
brief
at
page
6
thereof.
it
reads
as
follows,
no
person
shall
drive,
move
or
leave
standing
any
motor
vehicle,
trailers,
semi-trailer,
pole
or
pipe
dolly
or
auxiliary
dolly
upon
on
a
highway
unless
it
is
registered
and
the
appropriate
fees
have
been
paid
under
this
code,
section
4000
of
the
vehicle
code
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
to
fail
to
pay
the
fees.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
we
believe,
your
honor,
we're
talking
about
the
entire
amounts
involved.(voice

ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
i
believe
as
far
as
the
state
of
california
would
be
concerned,
it
would
be
quite
important
as
to
the
taxing
features
also
that
we
consider
the
taxing
features
as
far
as
the
particular
point
which
was
i
am
familiar
in
the
criminal
statute
of
it.
it
would
be
the
fact
that
completely
this
court
has
jurisdiction
regardless
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
i
do
not
believe
it
is.
i
still
believe
that
this
is
a
privilege
tax
under

ms.
