justice
abe
fortas
mr.
greer,
may
ask.
your
argument
on
this
point
requires
that
the
reference
to
this
code
in
section
4000
be
limited
to
the
vehicle
code?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
haven't
brief
that
i
take
it.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
your
only
basis
--
your
only
authority
for
that
statement?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
know
perhaps
undisputed,
perhaps
your
point
is
undisputed
but
presently
we
don't
have
any
authority
call
except
for
your
oral
argument,
is
that
right?
