justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
and
he
didn't
play
them,
there
was
residence
state
because
there
was
no
such
fee
required
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
not
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at.
this
is
a
case
where
the
whole
state
is
california
wants
to
get
the
registration
fees
--
is
this
the
registration
fee
or
a
license
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
want
to
get
it
because
they
say
the
state
of
washington
under
its
law
even
though
the
state
of
washington
could
not
get
it
since
he
wasn't
driving
the
car
inside
washington,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
amount
involved
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
wasn't
thinking
of
the
fine,
maybe
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
$100.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
suggests
ms.
maier,
in
this,
i
take
it
for
the
purpose
of
instruction
of
the
federal
statute,
the
state
label
would
not
to
be
conclusive,
would
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
call
it
--
you
said
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it's
a
privilege
tax
(voice
overlap)
but
i
gather
for
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
wondering
for
the
purposes
of
the
language
in
the
federal
statute
(voice
overlap)
property
taxes
whether
you
were
labeled
privilege
tax
would
conclude
us
on
whether
or
not
it's
spelled
within
the
federal
statute
would
suppose
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
keister
or
mr.
greer,
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
greer,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
from
confusion.
you
started
out
i
thought
in
effect
to
argue
that
this
case
ought
not
be
here
because
it
rested
on
an
adequate
state
ground
whether
it
was
a
prosecution
under
the
vehicle
code
and
therefore
that
we
don't
have
any
question
related
to
the
soldiers'
and
sailors
relief
act,
is
that
part
of
your
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
(voice
overlap)
i
don't
find
that
in
your
brief,
you
didn't
make
that
argument
in
your
brief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
find
--
i
don't
find
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
california
supreme
court
--
are
we
suppose
to
read
that
opinion
as
resting
on
--
that
this
was
an
improper
prosecution
under
the
vehicle
code?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
tendered
$8?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
you
never
offered
the
$8
either.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
tried
to
register
without
paying
any
money?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
not
a
hundred
dollars
but
they
offered
the
$8.
i
would
say
the
presumption
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
$8
he
would've
tendered
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
agree.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
he
might
have
offered
the
$8.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
what
you're
now
suggesting
is
that
this
prosecution
was
on
the
premise
that
it
could
be
sustained
by
proof
of
the
failure
of
the
2%
tax.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
it
can
be
sustained
only
by
proof
of
the
failure
of
the
$8
required
by
the
vehicle
code?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
that
the
reversal
of
the
conviction
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
was
on
the
ground
that
the
state's
proof
didn't
add
up
to
a
violation
of
the
vehicle
code?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
can't
find
that
--
anything
in
the
california
supreme
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
greer
i
looked
at
the
language
page
46,
defendant's
refusal
to
make
payment
of
the
fees
and
penalties,
this
is
the
california
supreme
court
opinion,
i
gather,
are
based
on
the
contention
in
section
4000
insofar
as
it
require
the
payment
of
fees
and
penalties
and
those
of
the
$8,
were
they
not,
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
all
right,
but
it
says
that
section
4000
insofar
as
it
require
the
payment
of
fees
and
penalty
it
was
certainly
the
$8
did
not
apply
to
him
because
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
relief
act.
that
seems
to
me
is
that
the
--
on
the
face
of
it,
the
california
supreme
court
seems
to
have
treated
it
as
a
claim
under
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
relief
act
as
the
$8
as
well
as
the
hundreds.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
you
would
like
us
to
say
that
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
relief
act
does
not
bar
california
from
collecting
both,
you
don't
want
us
to
stop
this
thing,
it
does
in
far
california
has
been
collecting
$8.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
right?
