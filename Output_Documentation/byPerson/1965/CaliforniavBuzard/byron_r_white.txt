how
much
did
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
they
said
to
him,
“alright,
you
pay
the
$8.”
and
he
said,
“no.”
and
they
convicted
him
and
then
and
the
case
went
up
here.
there
would
be
a
perfectly
legitimate
dispute
between
california
and
the
officer
that
california
claiming
that
that
unless
he
paid
a
registration
fee
in
washington,
he
had
to
pay
the
$8
in
california.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
say
that
issue
wasn't
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
even
that
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
why
should
we
assume
against
it,
why
should
we
make
reduction
against
the
state
of
california
in
this
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
page
you
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
that
the
court
went
right
on
and
said
that
california
could
not
force
him
to
register
and
to
pay
the
fees
and
penalties,
is
that
right,
because
of
the
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would've
thought
they
have
rules
that
they
couldn't
even
collect
the
$8.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
are
we
talking
about,
the
$8
as
a
whole
--
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
make
any
difference
to
you
on
the
issue
that
you
have
briefed
and
argued
that
which
is
to
whether
only
the
$8
or
the
full
amount
is
involved
between
the
right
of
the
california
to
put
--
to
put
anything
on
a
serviceman
who
have
not
registered
in
his
home
state,
the
issue
is
the
same
whether
it's
$8
or
a
hundred,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
other
--
the
other
part
of
it
that
you
said
which
i
was
asking
you
whether
this
was
a
property
tax.
if
it
were,
could
be
classified
in
ad
valorem
tax
and
has
another
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
because
there
is
something
different
about
the
other
hundred
dollars.
