mr.
thomas
keister
greer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
posture
of
this
case
is
such
that
i
don't
believe
the
court
can
reach
the
issue
under
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
relief
act
from
which
the
ruling
assault
by
the
people
of
the
state
of
california.
i
must
respectfully
submit
from
an
examination
of
the
record
that
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
improvidently
sold
and
that
there
are
jurisdictional
reasons
why
no
full
examination
of
the
soldiers
and
sailor's
relief
act
can
be
reached
in
the
case
as
it
now
stands.
an
explanation
of
the
jurisdictional
problem
requires
me
to
touch
very
briefly
on
the
structure's
statute
law
in
california.
david
dudley
field,
as
we
all
know,
pioneer
to
new
york
civil
practice
act
in
1848,
the
first
of
the
reformed
codes,
his
brother
steven
field,
mr.
justice
field
later
of
this
court
was
equally
interested
in
the
issue
of
law
reform
and
the
two
brothers
together
had
drawn
a
code
of
substantive
procedure
which
new
york
wouldn't
adopt
and
california
did
adopted.
california
adopted
four
codes
as
the
chief
justice
knows
and
i'm
going
to
go
into
this
very
briefly
because
it
may
not
be
submitted
to
the
other
members
of
the
court.
california
adopted
four
separate
codes
of
1872,
the
code
of
civil
procedure
based
largely
in
new
york,
the
civil
code,
the
probate
code
and
the
political
code,
now
they
were
always
separate,
they
were
always
autonomous
and
those
four
codes
are
today
25
separate
and
autonomous
codes.
one
of
them
is
the
vehicle
code.
the
california
vehicle
code
is
adopted
in
1935.
the
statute
creating
it
is
entitled
“an
act
to
establish
a
vehicle
code”
thereby
consolidating
and
revising
a
law
relating
to
vehicles
and
vehicular
traffic.
california
has
a
separate
code
called
“the
revenue
and
taxation
code”.
it
was
enacted
and
adopted
as
an
entirely
separate
feature
of
california's
code
law
of
its
statutory
structure
in
1939
and
section
1
of
that
code
states
as
follows,
this
act
shall
be
known
as
the
revenue
and
taxation
code.
now,
the
essence
of
this
case
in
the
posture
and
which
this
court
may
find
is
this,
that
the
vehicle
code
provides
in
section
9250
for
a
registration
fee,
a
registration
fee
of
$8.
“a
registration
fee
of
$8
shall
be
paid
to
department,
that's
the
department
of
motor
vehicles
for
the
registration
of
every
vehicle
of
a
type
subject
to
registration.”
and
the
vehicle
go
--
code
goes
further
in
section
4850
and
issues
a
mandatory
demand
on
the
department
of
motor
vehicles
have
said
this,
the
department
upon
registering
a
vehicle
shall
issue
to
the
owner
to
suitable
license
plates
or
devices
for
motor
vehicles.
the
plates
or
devices
shall
identify
the
vehicle
for
which
they're
issued
for
the
period
of
their
validity.
now,
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
which
the
learned
and
gracious
lady
who
appears
here
for
the
state
of
california
has
been
talking
about
when
she
expresses
and
the
attorney
general
of
california
expresses
such
great
concern
that
there
might
have
been
an
unlicensed
and
unregistered
vehicle,
a
vehicle
not
properly
identified
with
what
we
come
and
we
referred
to
as
license
or
registration
plates.
there
is
an
$8
registration
fee
under
this
first
statute
in
the
vehicle
code,
there
is
an
expressed
mandatory
order
to
the
department
of
motor
vehicles
of
when
that
$8
is
paid,
license
plates
shall
then
be
issued
the
type
that
we're
familiar
with,
two
of
them
to
be
put
on
the
front
of
the
and
back
of
the
automobile.
now,
captain
buzard,
a
pilot
in
the
strategic
air
command
who
according
to
a
quick
quote
that
i
made
this
morning
has
been
stationed
in
about
10
different
bases
at
lackland
at
san
antonio,
at
castle,
at
randolph
and
who
now
contrary
to
what
i
am
certain
as
the
inadvertent
expression
in
the
briefs
of
the
attorney
general
of
california
is
not
permanently
stationed
in
california.
he
isn't
--
he
is
now
flying
a
strategic
air
force
airplane
out
of
an
air
force
base
in
omaha.
captain
buzard
was
tried
under
section
4000
of
the
vehicle
code,
that's
the
jurisdictional
posture
of
this
case.
that's
the
case
as
it
comes
before
your
honors.
section
4000
states
this,
“no
person
shall
drive,
move
or
leave
standing
any
motor
vehicle,
trailer,
semi-trailer,
pole
or
pipe
dolly
or
auxiliary
dolly
upon
a
highway
unless
it
is
registered
and
the
appropriate
fees
have
been
paid
under
this
code”.
those
are
the
three
keywords,
those
are
the
reasons
why
i
have
to
respectively
suggest
to
the
court
that
i
think
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
improvidently
applied
for
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california
because
the
in
lieu
taxes
to
which
the
chief
justice
made
reference,
the
2%
tax
which
would've
amounted
here
to
some
hundred
dollars
are
at
in
no
place
referred
to
in
the
california
vehicle
code.
they
are
only
in
the
revenue
and
taxation
code
and
their
ad
valorem
quality
is,
i
respectfully
submit,
adequately
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
the
name
of
the
code
and
which
there
appear
is
called
revenue
and
taxation.
they
say,
section
10751
of
the
revenue
and
taxation
code,
a
license
fee
is
hereby
imposed
for
the
privilege
of
operating
on
the
public
highways
of
the
state,
any
vehicle
of
type
which
is
subject
to
registration
under
the
vehicle
code.
the
annual
amount
of
the
license
fee
shall
be
a
sum
equal
to
2%
of
the
market
value
of
the
vehicle
as
determined
by
the
department.
let
me
stop
right
there
and
interpolate
if
i
may.
this
captain
was
from
washington,
he
was
born
in
washington
and
like
most
of
us
when
he
had
a
chance
he
went
home
to
washington.
he
had
--
he
had
driven
not
on
product
of
his
own
but
under
orders
from
castle
air
force
base
down
to
maxwell
air
force
base
in
alabama.
the
record
reveals
he
had
driven
a
car
down
there,
a
car
with
washington
license
plates.
well,
that
was
in
september,
the
court
convict
judicial
notice
that
the
new
cars
were
coming
on
the
market.
he
had
a
chance
to
buy
a
demonstrator
which
had
belonged
to
a
dealer
in
alabama
license
tax
zone.
he
was
so
careful,
has
even
get
himself
in
alabama
driver's
license.
he
came
december
the
19th,
his
temporary
duty
of
almost
four
months
expired
and
he
drove
himself
his
automobile
with
his
wife
back
to
his
wife's
family
somewhere
in
the
midwest
and
arrived
back
in
california
on
new
year's
eve,
new
year's
eve
of
1959.
on
the
26th
day
of
february
less
than
two
months
later,
there
was
a
roadblock
right
outside
castle
air
force
base,
near
merced
--
merced
county,
california,
captain
buzard
was
stopped.
this
controversy
grew
out
of
that.
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
that
summer
he
went
home.
when
he
went
home,
he
paid
the
washington
tax,
he
got
himself
properly
--
the
--
the
proper
fees
were
paid
in
the
state
of
washington,
payment
of
them
in
california
would
in
no
way
have
immunized
him
from
the
fee
--
from
proper
fees
in
washington
because
under
section
574,
it's
only
the
payment
of
the
taxes
and
enormously
restate
that
immunized
taxation.
so,
if
he
had
to
pay
that
2%
of
that
1959
automobile
to
california
then
the
very
second
that
this
officer
got
home,
the
same
year
he
had
to
pay
it
again
and
that
looks
--
may
it
please
the
court,
it
looks
very
suspiciously
like
triple
taxation.
one
payment
in
alabama
where
he
was
on
duty,
one
payment
in
california
and
another
one
as
soon
as
he
went
home
the
very
sort
of
vulcanization
that
the
congress
sought
to
avoid
and
so
--
so
very
likely
to
happen
to
these
men
who
under
constant
orders
to
change
from
place
to
place.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
if
your
honor
please,
the
court
is
quite
correct
on
--
i
will
--
i
will
resume
that
point.
i
think
the
notion
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
no,
i
didn't.
if
the
court
please,
i
--
these
briefs
were
prepared
by
my
old
law
firm
in
california
and
--
and
were
sent
to
me.
the
point
that
this
--
the
point
about
this
prosecution
not
being
comprehended
by
section
4000
of
the
vehicle
code
is
certainly
not
spelled
out
in
the
brief.
i
think
in
--
i
think
it
can
be
fairly
said
that
it's
in
the
brief
but
it's
in
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
it's
a
jurisdictional
point,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
no,
if
your
honor
please,
the
california
supreme
court
said
that
the
man
was
not
guilty
under
section
4000
of
vehicle
code.
they
went
further
and
why
--
when
i
think
was
a
dictum
although
it
was
a
very
excellent
dictum.
they
held
that
the
soldiers
and
sailor's
relief
act
in
any
event
barred
this
2%
tax.
i
think
if
we
examine
the
record
that
we
have
to
see
that
there
is
no
way
under
which
he
could've
been
prosecuted
for
not
paying
the
2%
tax
under
this
warrant.
the
vehicle
code
itself
says
nothing
of
the
ad
valorem
tax
or
the
privilege
tax
as
opposing
counsel
calls
it.
the
vehicle
code
refers
to
no
fee
except
an
$8
registration
fee.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
he
tried
to
pay
it,
if
the
court
please,
and
was
frustrated
in
paying
it.
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
just
a
moment,
i'll
take
if
it
not
if
the
court
wishes.
the
attorney
general
says
this
that
this
unanimous
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
all
seven
justices
sitting
en
banc
frustrates
those
purposes
of
registration
designed
to
promote
motor
vehicle
identification
in
aid
of
proper
law
enforcement.
the
decision
authorizes
nonresident
servicemen
to
operate
their
vehicles
in
the
state
without
the
registration
of
the
vehicle
or
the
obtaining
of
license
plates
since
california
has
no
statutory
provisions
for
the
registration
of
such
vehicles
and
issuing
of
license
plates
without
the
payment
of
fees,
that's
in
the
attorney
general's
reply
brief.
but
the
only
provision
under
vehicle
code
about
license
plates
is
section
4850
and
the
only
provision
for
the
payment
of
fees
is
section
9250
and
the
only
fee
is
$8.
there
is
nothing
in
the
vehicle
code
about
the
2%.
now,
this
case
has
an
earlier
history
which
i
think
buys
the
attorney
general.
mr.
robinson,
counsel
for
captain
buzard
in
california
sought
a
writ
of
prohibition,
sought
prerogative
relief
from
the
district
court
of
appeal
in
california
to
prevent
this
prosecution
for
a
trial.
he
was
not
successful
in
that
prerogative
writ
proceeding.
the
district
court
of
appeal
denied
that
saying
the
case
should
be
tried
and
that
it
might
appear
when
the
case
was
tried
that
the
man
could've
paid
the
registration
fee,
that
it
didn't
sufficiently
appear
in
the
prerogative
writ
proceedings
that
he
had
tried
to
pay
the
fee.
so,
that
opinion
i
think
came
down
in
january
of
‘62
and
this
trial
thereafter
proceeded,
but
in
its
opinion,
the
california
district
court
of
appeal
and
this
is
itself
a
final
opinion
and
on
this
point
a
final
exposition
of
california
law.
the
california
district
court
of
appeal
in
the
case
of
buzard
against
justice
court
said
actually
vehicle
license
fees
are
fixed
by
the
revenue
and
taxation
code,
sections
10751,
et
seq.
furthermore,
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
vehicle
code
section
4000
to
fix
or
collect
the
fee.
the
registration
of
motor
vehicles
operate
within
the
state
is
required
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
innocent
purchasers
against
fraud,
to
provide
identification
of
responsible
persons
in
case
of
a
vehicular
accident
and
as
a
deterrent
vehicle
theft.
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
this,
“the
registration
statute
has
an
entirely
different
purpose
from
the
license
fee
statute
and
it
is
clearly
severable
from
them.”
now,
that
as
to
that
point,
there
is
a
very
considerable
clash
between
myself
and
the
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
california.
the
attorney
general's
position
is
that
you
have
to
pay
the
excise
tax
or
the
privilege
tax
or
the
ad
valorem
tax.
we
come
and
we
refer
to
it
as
an
in
lieu
tax.
before
you
can
register
the
car,
if
your
honors
please,
the
contrary
is
the
fact,
the
buzard
case
so
establishes
and
so
does
the
case
of
--
from
which
the
present
proceeding
is
on
appeal.
now,
counsel
representing
the
state
of
mississippi
said
they
might
have
to
be
forced
to
the
same
sort
of
thing
that
have
been
done
here
for
the
state
of
california,
that
is
criminal
proceedings
and
he
thereby
pointed
out
something
that
distinguished
this
case,
it
makes
it
different
from
all
the
others
that
have
been
before
the
court
or
that
are
pending.
this
is
a
criminal
case,
an
air
force
captain
has
--
had
a
criminal
complaint
filed
against
him
and
has
been
fined
$50.
he
was
suspended
for
six
months
on
his
good
behavior
but
it's
a
very
serious
thing
on
an
air
force
career
officer's
record.
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
he
has
been
on
active
duty
except
for
one
year
since
1951.
it's
a
criminal
case
bottomed
on
section
4000
of
the
criminal
code
--
4000
of
the
vehicle
code
the
narrow
issue
is
whether
there
was
any
evidence
to
sustain
the
conviction.
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
there
was
none,
the
statute
says,
“no
person
shall
drive,
move,
relieve
standing
a
motor
vehicle
upon
on
a
highway
unless
it's
registered
and
the
appropriate
fees
have
been
paid.”
under
this
code,
the
--
both
the
original
complaint
and
the
amended
complaint
filed
in
1960
are
in
the
record,
the
amended
complaint
appears
have
been
right
carefully
drawn
by
the
district
attorney
and
it
says
this,
i'll
paraphrase
the
first
sentence,
steven
b.
galvin,
merced
county
district
attorney
who
being
sworn
complaints
and
accuses
one
information
and
belief,
said
the
defendant
of
a
misdemeanor
to
with
failure
to
register
motor
vehicle
and
pay
appropriate
fees
in
violation
of
section
4000
vehicle
code
of
state
of
california.
now,
it
would
be
interesting
and
i
would
certainly
think
beneficial
to
have
an
examination
of
whether
california
could
in
fact
collect
that
$100,000,
that
2%
from
this
officer
who
let's
say
already
paid
it
once
in
alabama
and
paid
it
again
in
washington.
but
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
that
would
be
2%
tax
for
at
least.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
did
i
say
hundred
thousand?
well,
then
if
the
court
please
my
mind
is
up
on
which
higher
level
on
the
--
of
the
money
involved
this
morning
although
here
in
this
case,
it
may
very
well
involve
$100,000
servicemen
all
over
the
country
but
it
only
involves
a
$100
and
a
$50
fine
to
captain
buzard.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
i
have
to
ask
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
code
structure
in
california.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
that
the
language
under
this
code
in
section
4000
of
the
vehicle
code
refers
only
to
the
vehicle
code?
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
well,
i
think
the
title
of
the
vehicle
code
which
i
cited
earlier
which
states
that
title
of
the
statute
and
act
to
establish
a
vehicle
code
thereby
consolidated
in
revising
the
law
relating
to
vehicles
and
vehicular
traffic.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
i
think
if
the
court
please
that
the
--
that
a
substantial
portion
of
what
i'm
now
saying
is
not
spelled
out
in
the
briefs
here
before
filed
and
the
reason
that
i
have
taken
this
position
this
morning
is
because
i
do
think
the
point
is
jurisdictional
--
serious
constitutional
problems
mr.
justice
fortas,
if
an
inquiry
could
be
made
as
to
whether
or
not
these
taxes
under
the
revenue
and
taxation
code
could've
been
exacted
under
a
vehicle
code
prosecution.
the
revenue
and
taxation
code
not
being
referred
to
in
the
vehicle
code
section,
there
is
no
way
that
i
know
in
which
they
could
have
gone
into
even
by
consent.
there
is
no
jurisdiction
although
no
basis
whatever
for
a
prosecution
on
anything
other
than
failure
to
register
and
pay
the
$8.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
and
let
me
say
this,
that
i
have
--
i
have
for
the
last
week
or
two,
i
have
been
going
over
those
codes
right
assiduously
and
there
is
--
there
is
no
statement
such
is
this
in
the
vehicle
code.
before
you
can
register
or
words
to
that
effect
or
before
you
--
long
of
paying
$8,
you
also
got
to
pay
the
2%
required
by
the
--
by
revenue
and
taxation
code,
no
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
no
such
--
there
is
no
such
statute
in
california.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
it
--
i
think
that
if
your
honor
please
that
it
is
the
practice
but
we
are
here
talking
of
course
about
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
and
the
state
of
california,
the
people
of
the
state
which
initiated
this
prosecution
chose
to
limit
it
to
section
4000
of
the
vehicle
code
and
the
vehicle
code
i
vouch
to
your
honor
that
i
have
searched
it
most
carefully
and
that
there
is
no
cross
reference.
now,
did
i
say
--
i
would
very
much
like
to
see
this
court
if
it
could
hold
that
this
air
force
officer
was
not
required
to
pay
that
2%
in
lieu
tax
which
has
--
which
the
attorney
general
refers
to
as
a
privilege
tax
but
which
certainly
has
ad
valorem
qualities
but
i
understand
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
is
limited
to
cases
of
controversy,
so
i
am
informed
by
the
old
case
of
(inaudible)
against
united
states
that
this
court
doesn't
issue
advisory
opinions
and
i
for
the
life
that
we
cannot
see
how
this
case
in
its
--
in
its
present
posture
can
reach
any
discussion
of
whether
or
not
captain
buzard
had
to
pay
the
2%
excise
tax
or
the
privilege
tax
or
the
ad
valorem
tax
or
the
tax
required
by
the
revenue
and
taxation
code
in
california.
now
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
statutes
are
quoted
on
--
other
than
that,
i
would
have
to
say
that
there
is
certainly
no
discussion
and
that
i've
--
i've
talked
to
my
colleagues
about
this
say,
if
it
weren't
a
point
touching
on
jurisdiction,
i
--
i
--
i
wouldn't
raise
it.
and
i
--
this
sort
of
thing
probably
happens
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
although
i'm
with
the
california
bar,
i
live
in
virginia
and
these
briefs
as
i
say
were
drawn
in
california
and
drawn
very
easily
but
the
point
if
it
be
jurisdictional
and
obviously
is
the
criminal
case
can't
rise
above
the
foundation
like
the
original
complaint
and
the
amended
complaint,
both
of
which
specified
solely
vehicle
code
section
4000.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
only
to
this
extent.
the
supreme
court
speaking
through
mr.
justice
peak
said
that
that
the
conviction
was
void.
but
they
extend
through
the
merits
not
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
when
insofar
as
registration
is
concern,
if
your
honor
please,
i
reach
it
through
the
merits.
you
see
if
he
had
in
fact
violated
the
registration
statute,
if
he
had
in
fact
violated
section
4000
which
he
was
now
guilty
by
the
justice
court
then
the
supreme
court
of
california
would've
affirmed
the
conviction
entirely
apart
from
the
revenue
and
taxation
asked.
but
they
found
that
the
evidence
was
not
sufficient.
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
goes
considerably
beyond
that.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
well,
i
think
the
point
i
was
making
mr.
justice
is
they
said
it
couldn't
be
convicted
under
section
4000
as
far
as
registration
was
concerned
because
the
state
had
itself
frustrated
his
attempt
to
register
and
the
evidence
on
that
is
very
conclusive.
defense
counsel
asked
captain
buzard,
“did
you
go
to
the
department
of
motor
vehicles?”
“yes
sir.”
“did
you
go
there
for
purpose
of
registering
your
car?”
and
captain
buzard
testified
that
the
official
took
out,
“he
went
out
and
took
the
motor
number
and
filled
up
necessary
forms
to
register
the
car”
and
he
asked,
he
just
said,
“this
will
be
a
hundred
and
somewhat
dollars.”
in
other
words,
he
asked
him,
“i
want
to
make
this
point,
he
made
the
man
upon
you
for
a
hundred
and
excess
of
hundred
dollars,
is
that
correct?”
“yes.”
“now,
was
there
any
time
at
the
department
of
motor
vehicles
or
mr.
(inaudible)
offered
to
register
your
car
up
and
assisted
your
payment
of
hundred
dollars
excess
of
hundred
dollars?”
“no
sir.”
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
he
went
to
the
--
there's
no
evidence
your
honor.
he
went
there
and
he
said
that
he
told
him
that
he
didn't
have
that
much
cash
with
him
when
they
said
they
had
to
have
a
hundred.
i
think
we
may
simply
assume
that
it
--
that
if
they
have
said
that
they
would
take
only
$8
that
the
officer
that
would
appear
particular
where
the
state
has
the
burden
of
proof
and
has
a
high
a
very
high
burden
of
proof.
now,
when
this
evidence
came
in,
defense
counsel
asked
the
district
attorney
and
this
is
in
the
record
on
page
10,
“do
you
have
any
witnesses?”
and
the
district
attorney
said,
"no,
i
called
mr.
(inaudible)."
that's
the
department
of
motor
vehicles'
official
and
he
says
as
far
as
he
knew
that
what
you
said
was
right
and
defense
counsel
closed
he
said,
“that's
all”
defense
will
rest
your
honor
and
the
district
attorney
said,
“we
have
nothing
further
obviously”.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
yes
sir,
but
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
no
sir,
that's
not
here.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
i
think
the
state
of
california
have
a
much
stronger
case
because
we
are
not
here
contending
that
any
servicemen
should
be
out
on
the
highways
without
registration.
in
fact,
this
car
had
an
alabama
registration.
the
$8
would
have
been
almost
de
minimis,
this
officer
would
have
paid
it.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
because
they
wrongfully
asked
for
a
hundred
dollars
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
we
went
down
there,
if
the
court
please,
and
tried
to
register.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
no,
if
the
court
please,
the
officer
testified
that
he
went
down
there
and
that
he
didn't
have
that
much
cash
with
him.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
the
record
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
the
record
is
silent
on
that
point,
if
the
court
please.
i
think
this
that
there's
a
lot
of
difference
to
an
$8
and
hundred.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
and
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
all
--
the
only
answer
i
can
give
to
your
honors
is
the
record
is
silent
to
it.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
precisely.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
exactly
and
the
california
supreme
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
well,
it
--
you
will
find
this,
if
the
court
please,
you
will
find
the
statement
that
the
--
the
california
court
held
that
that
in
fact,
here's
the
language,
“in
fact
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
that's
on
page
46
of
the
record.
“in
fact,
his
attempt
to
register
the
vehicle
independently
of
the
payment
of
fees
and
penalties
was
frustrated
by
department.”
now,
the
court
might
very
well
ask
me,
well,
the
language
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
well,
they
said
this,
“contentions
which
looked
to
--
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
no,
i
don't
think
sir.
they
say
contentions
which
looked
to
the
purpose
of
registration
and
furtherance
of
proper
law
enforcement
and
administration
fail
to
address
themselves
to
this
issue.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
no,
there
is
no
penalty
on
the
$8,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
thomas
keister
greer
i
think
this,
i
think
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court,
if
the
court
please,
is
a
very
liberal
one
and
quite
properly
a
very
liberal
one
and
i
would
be
most
happy
for
its
decision
to
be
affirmed
on
a
proper
case
raising
to
those
issues
that
comes
with
this
court
and
i
think
with
attention.
