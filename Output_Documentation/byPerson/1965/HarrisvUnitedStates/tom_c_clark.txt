the

justice
tom
c.
clark
but
i'm
not
saying
that
it
was.
thank
you.[laughter]
justice
tom
c.
clark
all
it
said
was
the
statement
of
facts.
justice
tom
c.
clark
all
it
was
is
a
statement
of
facts.
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
that
should
be
adopted
as
it
was
but
it's
not
in
a
member
of
the
court.
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
wasn't
said
in
your
argument.
it
wasn't
said
in
their
argument.
they
say
it,
too.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
don't
know
why,
but
dictum
is
in
there.
i
think
it's
a
dictum
--
it's
not
a
dictum,
as
i
understand
dictum.
because
it's
merely
a
statement
of
fact
that
draws
to
the
attention
of
those
who
are
going
to
be
charged
of
the
duty
of
trying
one
for
contempt
which
the
fifth
circuit
of
that
time
to
appear
to
be
charged
with.
i
might
understand,
but
there
are
some
members
of
this
court
who
feel
that
where
the
offense
is
more
than
trivial
you
must
have
a
jury.
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
have
said
that,
historically,
there
was
support?
justice
tom
c.
clark
in
fact,
the
appendix
of
the
government
is
filed
here
today
which
is
much
more
voluminous
than
justice
goldberg
and
myself
were
able
to
find
in
the
short
trip
or
in
much
that
we've
worked
on.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
the
case
to
my
mind,
it
was
not
--
there
is
no
historical
evidence
that
--
back
there
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
that
there
was
any
such
practice.
justice
tom
c.
clark
your
argument
would
be
stronger
in
my
view,
if
you
just
said
flatfooted,
but
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
if
you
just
came
out
flatfooted
and
said
the
court
should
overrule
any
decisions
necessary.
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
you
haven't
got
