al
harris,
petitioner,
versus
united
states.
mr.
goldfarb.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
even
make
a
point
of
the
fact
that
the
courtroom
was
closed
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
will
adjourn
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
harris,
petitioner,
versus
united
states.
mr.
goldfarb,
you
may,
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
that
last?
i
didn't
quite
--
i
didn't
quite
get
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
spritzer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
spritzer,
when
was
this
contempt
first
committed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
he
then
have
sentenced
him
under
41
(a)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
42
(a),
you're
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
you
say
he
didn't
do
it
or
he
didn't
commit
him
for
contempt
committed
before
the
grand
jury.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
after
a
man
has
committed
one
contempt,
does
the
court
have
the
right
--
and
he's
subject
to
punishment
for
that,
does
the
judge
have
the
right
to
hear
him
before
the
court
and
require
him
to
reiterate
it
so
he
could
give
him
a
summary
punishment
rather
than
a
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
you
say
that,
in
any
contempt
committed
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
court,
that
the
court
could
bring
him
into
court
and
say,
“i
just
want
to
know
if
you
adhere
to
what
you
have
done
outside
of
court,”
and
when
the
man
says
“yes,”
summarily
punish
him
under
42
(a)
instead
of
42
(b)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
would
suppose
that
any
case
--
in
any
case
where
a
man
could
be
convicted
of
contempt
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
court
that
the
court
would
have
some
role
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
play
because
it
would
have
some
connection
with
the
court
or
it
wouldn't
be
a
contempt.
now,
in
just
what
cases
would
you
say
that
that
could
be
done
and
what
cases
that
couldn't
be
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
in
your
opinion,
is
the
extent
of
the
punishment
for
contempt
and
defiance
of
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
any
imprisonment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
assuming
that
this
court
has
--
would
have
the
power
to
reduce
a
punishment,
what
record
would
it
have
to
act
upon
in
a
case
like
this
where
the
judge
merely
said,
“this
is
a
contempt
proceeding.
i
find
you
guilty.
i
sentence
you
to
a
year
in
the
penitentiary."
now,
what
record
is
there
that
this
court
could
have
for
reducing
that
sentence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
some
awareness,
but
is
that
sufficient?
would
you
say,
some
awareness?
chief
justice
earl
warren
some
legal
reason?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
say
that
some
awareness,
rather
than
some
legal
reason,
would
be
sufficient
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
this
court
to
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
you
to
say,
in
response
to
my
earlier
question,
that
the
contempt
which
is
being
punished
for
was
only
this
last
appearance
in
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
was
just
as
brief
as
i
have
stated.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
they
said,
“this
is
a
contempt
trial.
you're
guilty.
you
go
to
prison
for
a
year.”
now,
what
is
there
on
that
record,
if
that's
the
contempt
that
he's
charged
with,
what
is
there
in
that
contempt
that
would
--
in
that
sentence
that
would
enable
us
to
review
the
case
to
determine
whether
it
was
a
just
and
reasonable
sentence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
shouldn't
a
man
have
a
right
to
put
--
to
have
in
the
record,
at
least,
what
defense
he
had
to
the
charge
of
contempt
before
he
was
sentenced
to
a
year
in
penitentiary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean,
before
this
contempt
was
committed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
that
wasn't
the
contempt
for
which
he
was
committed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
if
this
is
a
new
contempt,
the
contempt
that
he's
being
charged
with,
why
do
you
take
into
consideration
all
the
history
that
goes
before
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
counsel
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he
wanted
to
show
in
defense
that
this
wasn't
an
open
court
proceeding.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
how
could
he
ever
raise
that
before
us?
and
if
it
wasn't
an
open
court
proceeding,
would
this
be
a
valid
judgment,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
how
could
the
man
raise
it
if
--
in
this
court
if
that
was
something
that
he
had
in
mind?
evidently,
he
did
have
something
of
that
kind
in
mind
because
he
asked
the
court.
he
said,
“this
is
a
closed
proceeding,”
and
the
judge
said,
“no,
we
opened
it
two
or
three
minutes
ago.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
suppose
the
man
had
been
given
an
opportunity
to
defend
himself,
in
some
way
or
other,
under
42
(b)
or
under
jury
trial
or
in
some
way
and
he
had
said,
“i
was
convicted
of
this
contempt
in
a
closed
proceeding.”
i
suppose
he
put
on
the
grand
jurors
and
others
who
were
there
in
the
courtroom
to
show
that
that
was
the
fact.
how
would
we
ever
be
able
to
disclose
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
might
have
said
it
for
the
record
but
still,
he
wasn't
being
tried.
he
was
already
convicted.
the
judge
had
already
convicted
him
and
sentenced
him
to
a
year.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
suppose
that
or
any
other
defense
that
he
wanted
to
raise,
there
might
be
other
defenses
he
wanted
to
raise.
does
he
have
to
raise
every
possible
defense
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
this
proceeding
that
he
might
have
raised
in
that
court
if
he
had
been
given
an
opportunity
to
do
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
judge
offer
him
an
opportunity
to
present
any
facts
or
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
spritzer,
what
happened
to
a
man
under
£200
penalty
if
he
didn't
pay
the
fine?
what
--
you
say
there
wasn't
any
imprisonment.
what
did
they
do
with
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
want
us
to
understand,
mr.
spritzer,
that
you
and
the
attorney
general
are
concerned
less
in
civil
rights
cases,
lest
the
court
deprive
the
courts
of
the
right
to
summarily
commit
the
man
to
prison
for
a
term
of
years
as
they
did
in
the
green
case
and
the
brown
case?
do
you
want
that
--
do
you
think
that
power
is
desirable
for
use
in
such
cases?
i
only
say
that
because
you
mentioned
civil
rights
cases.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
relying
on
the
power
and
extent
of
the
court
as
in
green
and
brown.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
shouldn't
you
stick
with
them?
