justice
potter
stewart
that
argument
was
dealt
with
and
answered
in
the
case
of
brown
against
the
united
states
wasn't
it,
because
i
remember
it.
in
fact
to
be
sure,
it
was
contempt
before
the
grand
jury
and
the
witness
refused
the
answer
the
questions
posited
to
him
before
the
grand
jury
and
as
such
a
contempt
could
have
been
tried
under
42(b),
that
there
was
a
second
contempt
in
the
presence
of
the
court
and
the
court
then
directed
the
witness
to
answer
the
questions
after
telling
him
that
he
complete
immunity,
that
kind
of
contempt
could
be
stated
against
under
42(a).
justice
potter
stewart
but
doesn't
that
answer
the
argument,
whether
--
justice
potter
stewart
satisfaction
i
gather,
it
is
not
a
satisfactory
answer,
but
at
least
that
is
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
answers
that
case
to
your
argument,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
right,
am
i
not,
in
my
understanding
that
unlike
ordinary
criminal
convictions,
this
court
has
declared
that
it
has
the
power
to
review
a
sentence
in
a
criminal
contempt
case.
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
is
the
constitutional
right,
to
be
tried
by
a
jury
if
your
sentence
is
going
to
be
more
than
a
year,
more
than
six
months
or
more
than
five
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
congress
retain
alternatively
the
power
to
try
contempts,
if
so?
justice
potter
stewart
and
have
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
this
argument
--
there
is
no
point
in
entering
a
debate,
but
i'm
sure
you're
aware
that
the
arguments
you're
making
cuts
the
other
way
as
well.
if
congress
had
to
do
this,
it
meant
that
only
an
act
of
congress
could
change
the
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
but
also,
congress
had
to
--
had
expressly
and
specifically
explicitly
provide
that
certain
offenses
--
certain
contempts
should
be
triable
by
a
jury.
the
implication
--
i
suppose
the
natural
implication
is
that,
in
the
absence
of
such
an
explicit
provision,
they
will
not
be
triable
by
a
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
let's
say
this
is
a
game
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
should
be
played.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
goldfarb,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
argument.
do
you
--
is
it
an
all
out
argument?
do
you
concede
that
there
might
be
cases
either
involving
minor
contempts
or
cases
even
if
the
contempt
were
major
but
in
which
the
punishment
were
--
would
be
restricted
to
some
very
light
punishment
that
the
jury
trial
would
not
be
required?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
alternatively
--
justice
potter
stewart
alternatively,
but
i
--
one
of
your
alternatives
is
across
the
board,
jury
trial
in
all
contempts,
but
now
your
other
alternative.
you
differentiate
then
between
the
seriousness
of
the
contempt
or
between
the
power
of
the
court
to
impose
sentences
with
or
without
a
jury
trial,
that
is
maybe
up
to
30
days
without
one
or
finally,
whether
or
not
the
contempt
is
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
court
or
outside
the
presence
of
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
you
mean
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
understand
by
what
you
referred
to
as
the
petty
offense
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought,
mr.
goldfarb,
that
quite
apart
from
of
course
a
jury
trial,
all
--
it
has
well
been
established
that
all
such
questions
were
entirely
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
this
person's
contempt.
the
only
question
there
was,
had
he
been
directed
by
the
court
to
answer
the
questions
and
did
he,
after
having
been
directed
to
do
so,
refuse
to
do
so?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
--
now,
there
might
be
a
relevance
as
to
his
sanity
or
insanity,
and
that
was
the
panico
case.
but.
justice
potter
stewart
--
no
such
suggestion
is
made
here,
and
therefore,
there
were
no
other
issues
in
the
case.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
the
established
law
that
all
these
matters
of
the
breadth
of
the
immunity
statute
and
what
the
grand
jury
was
actually
inquiring
into
and
so
on,
were
--
could've
been
raised
if
at
all,
having
been
decided
here
by
judge
mcclain
against
the
petitioner
could
have
been
raised,
if
at
all,
only
if
as
or
when
this
person
should
have
been
--
might
have
been
proceeded
against
in
another
criminal
proceeding.
it
was
then
and
there
that
he
could
have
raised
the
--
that
the
question
of
the
breadth
of
the
immunity
statute
would
have
arisen.
isn't
that
right?
don't
the
cases
stand
for
that?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
he
had
been
given
a
jury
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
we
know?
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
have
been
admissible
in
his
defense?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
suggest
might
have
been?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
kind
of
subjects
do
you
suggest
might
conceivably
be?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
the
only
issue
whether
he
was
directed
to
answer
the
questions
and
whether
or
not
he
refused?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
possible
ones
would
--
might
you
suggest,
outside
of
insanity
or
insanity?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
a
demand
for
a
jury
trial
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
i've
just
been
looking
through
the
transcript.
i
don't--
justice
potter
stewart
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
out
until
now.
justice
potter
stewart
because
it
doesn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
couldn't
find
it.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
spritzer,
excuse
me.
i'm
just
going
to
say
on
that
--
without
regard
for
the
severity
of
the
punishment.
justice
potter
stewart
the
record
shows
that
the
court
was
open
by
proclamation
on
page
60.
justice
potter
stewart
at
page
33
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
also
said
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
also
said
this
is
a
contempt
committed
in
open
court,
and
he
said
that
is
for
the
conviction.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
you
to
be
saying,
mr.
spritzer,
that
whether
or
not
the
proceeding
is
under
42
(a)
or
42
(b)
or
in
a
courtroom
where
there
is
a
jury,
the
problem
of
the
severity
of
the
sentence
is
a
separate
problem
which
is
not
affected
by
the
nature
of
that
deter
--
of
how
the
guilt
of
contempt
is
determined.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
this
court
or
any
reviewing
court
would
have
no
more
and
no
less
after
42
(a)
proceeding
or
42
(b)
proceeding
or
a
jury
proceeding
to
test
the
validity
of
the
severity
of
the
sentence.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
quite
a
separate
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
as
request
for
a
jury
trial
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
any
specific
request
for
a
jury
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
any
words.
