mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
turn
first
to
the
procedural
issue
whether
the
district
judge
here
erred
in
proceeding
under
rule
42
(a),
which
of
course
authorizes
the
judge
to
proceed
forthwith
if
he
certifies
that
he
saw
or
heard
the
conduct
constituting
the
contempt
and
that
it
was
committed
in
his
actual
presence.
that
is
a
precise
description
of
the
case
we're
dealing
here
with
here
today.
the
contempt
was
committed
in
his
presence
and
he
certified
that
he
saw
and
heard
it.
now,
faced
with
this,
petitioner
says
in
its
brief
--
in
his
brief,
and
i
quote
from
it,
“certainly,
the
distinguishing
factor
between
the
application
of
rule
42
(a)
and
the
application
of
rule
42
(b)
is
not
whether
the
event
occurred
in
the
presence
of
the
court.”
frankly,
i
don't
understand
that,
unless
it
means
that
certainly,
the
rule
doesn't
mean
what
it
says.
and
i'm
not
aided
by
the
single
citation
which
--
with
which
that
proposition
is
adorned
with
reference
to
the
case
of
panico
versus
united
states.
now,
it's
quite
true
that
panico
was
a
contempt
case
and
that
it
was
preceded
against
under
rule
42
(a).
it's
also
true
that
this
court
sent
the
case
back
for
a
hearing,
but
it
didn't
send
it
back
for
a
hearing
as
to
whether
the
contempt
occurred
in
the
presence
of
a
judge.
it
sent
it
back
for
a
further
hearing
because
the
judge
had
evidence
before
him
which
cast
out
on
panico's
sanity
and
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
a
need
for
observation
of
this
man,
an
expert
testimony,
and
a
further
hearing
on
that
question.
this
case,
it
seems
to
us,
is
completely
controlled
by
graham
against
united
states,
decided
only
five
or
six
years
ago,
followed
a
year
later
in
levine
against
united
states,
and
judge
mcclain
in
the
instant
case
conscientiously
and
meticulously
followed
the
exact
procedure
which
this
court
had
only
recently
approved.
your
honors
will
find
that
every
single
factor
which
the
majority
opinion
in
brown
relied
on
is
present
here.
i
shall
also
point
out
in
a
few
moments,
that
certain
factors
upon
which
the
dissenting
justices
relied
in
brown
are
absent
here.
but
to
do
that,
it's
necessary
first
for
me
to
review
briefly
the
sequence
of
events,
and
i
propose
to
show
that
there
was
no
percipito
--
precipitous
action
taken
by
the
judge
here,
and
that
matters
were
fully
explored
and
that
there
were
no
unresolved
issues
of
fact
before
the
judge.
this
all
began
with
a
subpoena
answered
by
the
petitioner
on
july
31,
1963.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
charge
advised
him
that
the
grand
jury
was
investigating
violations
of
the
communications
act
and
of
18
u.s.c.
1952,
a
statute
which
has
to
do
with
interstate
travel
or
transportation
in
aid
of
racketeering
enterprises.
petitioner
was
also
advised
of
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
which
he
proceeded
to
claim.
he
was
then
told
that
since
the
inquiry
related
to
violations
of
the
communications
act,
he
would
have
immunity
under
the
terms
of
that
statute
for
any
transaction,
matter,
or
thing
concerning
which
he
testified
--
was
compelled
to
testify
after
having
claimed
his
privilege.
he
was
again
directed
to
answer
and
again
--
and
at
this
point,
again
refused.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
subpoena
--
the
first
subpoena
did
not
cite
the
communications
act
at
all.
it
referred
to
some
subpoenas,
that
some
--
the
conspiracy
statute,
your
honor.
i
--
he
was
advised
by
the
assistant
that
they
were
looking
into
the
communications
act.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
was
the
government's
contention
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
--
that
the
grand
jury
had
apparent
authority
to
investigate
and
was
investigating
violations
of
the
communications
act,
as
well
as
other
violations.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
that.
the
petitioner
attempted
to
bring
that
question
to
this
court
and
the
court
in
granting
the
writ
expressly
eliminated
it.
and
so
we
have
not,
for
that
reason
raised
it.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
was,
and
the
united
states
attorney
argued
to
the
court
that
he
was
investigating
violations
of
the
communications
act
and
other
crimes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
i
suppose
the
subscriber's
complicity
and
any
breaches
of
that,
yes.
the
next
day,
after
this
july
31st
refusal
to
testify,
the
petitioner
was
brought
before
the
district
court,
his
counsel
with
him.
judge
mcclain
advised
him
that
this
was
not
a
contempt
hearing
and
that
he
wished
to
satisfy
himself
before
taking
any
further
steps
for
issuing
any
directions
that
if
petitioner
answered
the
grand
jury's
questions,
he
would
have
an
immunity
broad
enough
to
protect
him
from
any
possible
prosecution.
the
judge,
after
hearing
argument,
and
he
heard
petitioner's
counsel
fully,
concluded
that
petitioner,
contrary
to
his
counsel's
contention
would
have
full
immunity
if
he
testified
in
a
proceeding
in
which
the
government
was
investigating
communications
act
violations
even
though
it
was
also
investigating
other
crimes.
he
then
ruled
that
in
order
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
grand
jury
was
investigating
the
communications
act
violations,
among
other
things,
the
subpoena
issued
to
the
petitioner
should
recite
the
fact
that
the
communications
act
violations
were
involved.
that
was
done.
a
new
subpoena
was
issued
with
this
recitation
and
petitioner
appeared
approximately
a
week
later,
on
august
7.
the
result
was
a
reenactment
of
the
first
appearance
before
the
grand
jury.
petitioner
and
his
counsel
were
again
summoned
before
the
court.
this
was
of
the
second
appearance
before
the
judge.
the
judge
heard
argument
on
the
afternoon
of
august
7th,
during
which
petitioner's
counsel
once
more
contended
at
some
length
that
the
immunity
statute
was
inapplicable
or
was
insufficient
when
the
grand
jury
was
investigating
other
crimes.
far
from
proceeding
with
unseemly
haste,
the
judge
adjourned
the
proceedings
until
the
following
day
in
order
to
give
the
matter
further
thought.
petitioner
and
his
counsel
appeared
the
judge
a
third
time
on
the
morning
of
august
8.j
udge
mcclain
ruled
at
this
point
that
he
was
completely
satisfied
that
petitioner
would
have
full
protection
under
the
immunity
statute
if
he
testified,
and
he
directed
him
to
respond.
petitioner
was
taken
before
the
grand
jury
promptly
thereafter
and
he
again
refused.
thereupon,
petitioner
and
his
attorney,
government
counsel,
and
the
grand
jury
appeared
together
in
the
courtroom.
the
grand
jury
reporter
was
sworn
and
read
the
transcript
of
the
proceedings
which
had
just
transpired.
and,
at
this
point,
the
fourth
appearance
before
the
judge,
judge
mcclain
ordered
petitioner
to
be
sworn
and,
then
and
there,
directed
him
to
answer
the
questions.
the
court
ruled,
when
he
again
refused,
that
this
was
a
contempt
in
the
court's
presence.
he
stated
that
he
had
repeatedly
heard
and
considered
all
of
the
arguments
of
counsel.
he
had
previously
ruled
that
he
would
not
consider
evidence
as
to
the
motives
of
the
grand
jury
and
that
he
had
concluded
that
the
arguments
made
by
petitioner,
that
petitioner
would
not
have
full
immunity,
were
not
well
grounded.
he
then
sentenced
petitioner
to
a
year
in
jail.
he
admitted
petitioner
to
bail
so
that
he
could
make
his
legal
arguments
on
appeal
without
suffering
commitment
in
the
interim.
he
also
stated
on
the
record
that
he
would
entertain
a
motion
for
a
reduction
of
sentence
if
petitioner
so
moved
after
having
testified.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
were
several
contempts,
your
honor.
the
only
contempt
which
was
punished
by
the
judge
was
the
contempt
committed
in
the
court's
presence
on
august
8.
he
could
have
proceeded
against
the
refusals
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury.
following
the
procedure
in
brown,
he
himself,
directed
petitioner
once
more
to
answer
in
his
presence.
that
was
the
contempt
which
the
judge
punished.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
rule
42
(a)?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
he
did
so.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood.
i
said
the
contempt
for
which
he
was
punished
was
the
one
committed
before
the
judge,
the
last
contempt.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
no,
if
he
had
proceeded
against
him
for
a
contempt
not
committed
in
his
presence,
the
procedure
would
have
been
that
set
out
in
rule
42
(b).
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
purpose
of
the
hearing,
your
honor,
i
think
would
be
to
establish
the
fact,
whether
the
contempt
had
occurred
outside
the
presence
of
the
judge.
the
reason
that
a
hearing
is
not
required
when
it
concurs
in
his
presence
is,
i
believe
and
has
always
been
taken
to
be,
that
the
judge
doesn't
need
witnesses
to
a
contempt
which
occurs
right
before
it.
i
don't
view
this
as
an
evasion
of
any
rule.
i
view
it,
rather
as
a
recognition
that
in
this
instance,
there
was
nothing
further
of
the
way
of
proof
necessary
to
establish
the
fact
to
the
judge's
satisfaction.
this
court
had
only
recently
approved
the
idea
in
the
brown
case
that
the
judge
might
make
one
more
effort
to
influence
the
man
to
give
the
testimony
that
the
law
requires
by
calling
him
before
the
court,
and
i
think
judge
mcclain
was
following
that
authority
when
he
acted
and
he
referred
to
the
brown
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
certainly
agree
that,
in
a
case
of
an
ordinary
crime,
the
jury
serves
a
variety
of
functions.
the
hearing
that
is
required
by
rule
42
(b)
where
it
is
applicable
is,
i
take
it,
a
hearing
in
order
to
acquaint
the
judge
with
the
facts,
and
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
chief
justice's
question
as
to
whether
the
petitioner
was
deprived
of
a
right
in
as
much
as
the
judge
had
proceeded
under
rule
42
(a),
rather
than
rule
42
(b).
and
my
response
was
that
i
don't
think
there
was
any
doubt
or
can
be
as
to
the
basic
fact
whether
this
petitioner
refused
to
answer
nor
do
i
understand
the
petitioner
to
urge
that
there's
any
dispute
as
to
that
fact.
i'd
say
that
fact
was
known
to
the
judge
because
it
occurred
in
his
presence.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
was
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
meant
in
the
context
of
rule
42.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
say
that
as
to
any
your
honor,
but
i
do
say
that
the
trial
judge
has
a
direct
function
in
relation
to
the
performance
of
the
grand
jury.
the
grand
jury
is
part
of
the
district
court.
the
grand
jury
depends
upon
the
judge
for
the
power
to
summon
a
witness
and
for
the
power
to
compel
him
to
testify.
the
judge
has
a
role.
this
is
the
only
--
the
grand
jury's
process
is
enforced
through
the
judge
and
therefore,
i
don't
think
it
unreasonable
for
the
judge
to
use
his
efforts
before
holding
a
man
in
contempt
to
induce
him
directly
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury.
the
court's
process
is
what
compels
testimony
before
the
grand
jury.
so,
i
don't
think
that
any
case
would
be
a
fair
analogue
to
the
case
that
we
have.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
know.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
i'm
on
clear
ground
in
this
case
because
the
court,
has
twice,
had
this
problem
before
it
and
has
ruled
that
it
is
a
proper
function
of
the
district
court
to
seek
to
implement
the
performance
of
the
grand
jury
in
this
way.
this
case
is
absolutely
indistinguishable
from
two
cases
which
your
honors
have
decided
in
recent
years.
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
that
should
be
the
method
of
proceeding
in
all
cases
of
contempts
certainly,
nor
do
i
think
that
that
is
my
burden
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
were
three
steps
that
morning
of
august
8.
the
judge
first
had
the
petitioner
and
counsel
in
and
directed
him
to
testify.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
was
in
the
courtroom
in
which
i
guess,
the
grand
--
the
courtroom
that
the
grand
jury
was
using.
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
is
the
last
step.
i
was
tracing
through
the
three
steps.
the
record
shows,
as
to
the
last
step,
that
it
was
in
the
courtroom
with
the
ju
--
with
the
grand
jury
present.
i
don't
--
do
we
have
any
--
am
i
clear
on
this
or
did
you
have
a
question
beyond
that,
your
honor?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
grand
--
when
the
man
refused
to
testify
on
the
last
occasion
before
the
grand
jury,
the
judge
was
notified.
he
then
assembled
in
the
courtroom
and
i'm
willing
to
assume,
i
don't
recall
whether
the
judge
went
to
the
courtroom
where
the
grand
jury
sat
or
the
grand
jury
members
came
to
his
courtroom
that
the
court
reassembled,
that
much
is
evident
from
the
record
in
a
courtroom.
the
judge,
now
present,
along
with
petitioner's
counsel,
who
of
course
had
not
been
present
during
the
prior
grand
jury
session.
at
that
point,
the
hearing
became
an
open
hearing.
now,
there
was
no
--
the
transcript
does
not
contain
any
declaration
by
the
court
prior
that
the
court
is
now
open
and
the
judge
apparently
regarded
all
of
the
proceedings
which
he
held
at
which
he
presided
as
being
an
open
court.
when
counsel,
a
few
moments
later,
indicated
that
he
was
not
aware
that
this
was
an
open
proceeding,
the
judge
said
“yes,
this
is
an
open
hearing
and
it
has
been
for
the
last
few
minutes.”
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
if
the
judge
says
it's
an
open
hearing
and
the
records
of
the
clerk
show
it's
an
open
hearing
and
counsel
doesn't
make
any
contest
to
that,
doesn't
make
any
record
whatever
that
the
judge's
statement
that
it's
an
open
hearing
must
stand.
and
i
would
say
further,
that
no
claim
was
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
that
there
was
any
question
in
this
case
that
these
proceedings
were
secret
and
i
don't
think
that
question
is
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it's
an
aspect
of
all
judicial
proceedings
i
suppose,
that
they
be
open
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
i
would
say
that
counsel
can
make
certain
if
the
courtroom
is
open
in
a
hearing
before
the
judge.
and
if
the
counsel
here
had
any
doubt
on
that
score,
he
certainly
could
have
indicated
it
before
the
judge.
there's
no
record
to
suggest
that
the
judge
erred
when
he
said
that
this
was
an
open
hearing
and
anyone
can
come
in.
i
assume
from
his
statement,
the
doors
were
open.
i
said
earlier
that
i
thought
this
case
was
a
fortiori
from
brown
and
i
think
it
is,
and
that,
the
judge's
handling
of
this
cannot
be
fairly
characterized
as
spur
of
the
moment.
i
think
he
did
explore
every
issue
that
was
raised
before
him
in
several
colloquies
with
counsel.
i
should
like
to
proceed
to
the
second
question
raised
by
petitioner,
which
is
his
broad
challenge
to
the
government's
contention
that
a
jury
trial
is
not
required
in
contempt
cases.
i
shall
have
to
be
brief,
especially
since
i
do
wish
to
attempt
to
explain
that
there
may
be
something
in
this
volume
that
is
more
than
mere
poundage.
i
do
want
to
treat
the
third
question
in
the
case.
the
issue
of
a
right
to
jury
trial
is
--
of
course,
has
been
extensively
briefed
and
argued
in
recent
years
before
this
court
in
both
the
green
and
in
the
barnett
cases.
i
shall
only
review
very
briefly
the
principal
arguments
which
we
advanced
in
those
cases.
our
contention,
of
course,
basically
is
that
the
framers
did
not
treat
contempt
as
a
crime
or
a
as
a
criminal
prosecution
in
the
sense
that
those
terms
are
used
in
article
3
and
in
the
sixth
amendment.
we
relied
in
green
and
barnett
upon
the
english
common
law,
upon
the
fact
that
all
of
the
commentators
who
were
known
to
the
colonists
had
stated
flatly
that
contemnors
were
subject
to
attachment
and
to
trial
by
the
court.
and,
we
pointed
to
what
seemed
to
us
to
be
a
fairly
uniform
practice
among
the
colonies
of
which
i
shall
say
more
later.
we
also
relied
heavily
upon
the
first
judiciary
act
of
1789.
that
is
the
statute,
after
all,
which
was
reported
by
a
senate
judiciary
committee,
a
majority
of
whose
members
were
members
of
the
constitutional
convention.
and
that
act
unequivocally
conferred
upon
the
courts
in
their
discretion,
the
power
to
punish
contempts
by
fine
or
imprisonment.
i
should
like
to
add
a
footnote
to
that.
the
congress
in
1790,
passed
the
first
general
crimes
act.
the
general
crimes
act,
which
set
forth
all
of
the
offenses
which
congress,
at
that
time,
wished
to
make
crimes,
made
no
reference
whatever
to
contempt.
contempt
was
dealt
with
exclusively
in
the
statute
which
created
the
federal
courts.
and
i
submit
that
the
only
satisfactory
explanation
of
that
is
that
the
first
congress
regarded
that
power
in
conformity
with
the
established
tradition
and
practice
that
they
knew
as
an
inherent
power
of
the
court.
now,
from
the
beginning
until
the
present
day,
the
suggestion
that
a
jury
trial
is
constitutionally
required
in
contempt
cases
had
been
rejected
by
this
court
in
what
justice
harlan
termed
in
the
green
case
as
“a
long
and
unbroken
line
of
decisions.”
i
think,
indeed,
that
i
am
right
in
suggesting
that,
until
the
green
case
itself
decided
some
170
years
after
the
constitution,
not
a
single
justice
had
dissented
from
this
view.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
believe.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
i
withdraw
that.
i
think
that
the
argument
was
made.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
it
was
made.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
either
event,
we
don't
question
that
it's
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
what
counsel
said
in
the
colloquies,
i
don't
immediately
recall.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
don't
think
the
distinction
between
general
crimes
and
contempts
is
an
arbitrary
one.
there
are
differences
of
moment.
a
general
statute
defining
a
crime
remains
a
proscription
addressed
to
the
world
at
large
until
it
is
implemented
by
legal
proceedings.
defiance
of
a
judge,
whether
it
is
by
misbehavior
in
the
courtroom
or
by
direct
disobedience
of
the
court's
process
takes
place
after
the
legal
process
has
crystallized.
the
authority
of
the
court,
so
to
speak,
is
on
the
line.
its
very
authority
to
function
effectively
may,
in
some
instances,
be
at
stake.
the
attorney
general,
the
solicitor
general,
the
department
of
justice
are
particularly
and
gravely
concerned
by
the
problems
which
are
incident
to
the
enforcement
of
injunctive
decrees
of
the
federal
court.
injunctions,
of
course,
are
characteristically
issued
when
there
is
a
grave
threat
of
the
irreparable
injury,
perhaps
a
threat
to
the
fundamental
rights
of
those
who
invoke
its
protective
cloak.
in
the
last
decade,
certainly,
we
have
seen
many
instances
in
which
injunctive
orders
were
issued
to
guard
the
rights,
not
to
mention
the
lives
and
the
property,
of
minority
groups
seeking
to
assert
their
constitutional
rights
as
declared
in
decisions
of
this
court.
time
and
again,
the
local
federal
judge
had
been
called
upon
to
enjoin
conduct
which
would
interfere,
perhaps
violently
interfere,
with
the
exercise
of
those
rights
in
communities
where
the
dominant
majority
was
a
validly
hostile,
oftentimes,
communities
where
not
a
single
voice
among
the
majority
could
be
found
to
defend
the
court
order.
we
believe
that
a
rule
which
would
say
that
the
federal
judge
could
vindicate
his
lawful
order
in
such
a
situation
only
with
the
unanimous
concurrence
of
12
members
of
that
community
would
be
a
very
serious
setback
to
attempts
with
which
the
attorney
general
is
charged
in
his
efforts
to
vindicate
constitutional
and
other
rights.
now,
this
has
been
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
severity
of
the
punishment
is
a
question,
your
honor,
quite
apart
from
the
question
of
procedure
and
trial
by
jury.
i
have
never
contended,
and
we
do
not
contend,
that
this
court
should
not
strike
down
excessive
punishments
where
they
occur.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
precisely
that
defined
by
statute,
your
honor,
which
is
fine
or
imprisonment.
we
agree.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
the
sound
discretion
of
the
court
subject
to
the
review
of
the
appellate
courts
and
of
this
court.
that
is
the
same
punishment
that
would
exist
in
the
case
of
a
jury
trial,
i
take
it.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
you
do
have
some
awareness
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
your
role,
your
honor,
would
be
similar
to
that
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
was
pointing
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
was
pointing
to
the
fact
that
i
don't
think
it's
quite
the
case
that
you
have
nothing
but
the
judge
pronouncing
sentence.
you
have
an
awareness
of
the
kind
of
proceeding
that
was
involved,
what
the
misconduct
consisted
of
whether
it
was
persistent,
what
steps
the
judge
took
to
attempt
to
induce
the
man
to
comply,
as
well
as
his
final
imposition
of
sentence.
i
think
your
judgment
in
circumstances
like
this,
whether
a
punishment
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
view
of
the
nature
of
the
offense
is
similar
to
the
kind
of
judgment
a
legislature
makes
when
it
says,
“we
think
no
more
than
one
year
for
assault
and
battery”
or
“no
more
than
five
years
would
be
reasonable
for
this
offense.”
i
would
say
further
that
any
additional
circumstances
which
bear
upon
the
particular
misconduct
may
be
taken
into
account.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
problem
of
judging
whether
a
sentence
is
excessive
is
there,
whether
or
not
there
has
been
trial
of
the
facts
by
a
jury.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
did.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
that
was
the
contempt.
the
only
additional
point
i
was
making
was
that
i
think
the
court
could
take
account
of
the
antecedent
conduct
which
led
up
to
that
final
direction
and
refusal.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
your
honor,
the
counsel
for
petitioner
stated
that
he
wished
to
argue
and
he
did
argue
repeatedly
before
the
judge
on
several
occasions.
he
wished
to
argue
that
if
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
as
the
--
there
were
four
hearings
before
the
judge,
at
which
times,
the
judge
told
him
to
testify.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
did
say
that,
your
honor,
but
then
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
was
the
fourth
reenactment
of
a
dispute
which
had
been
argued
three
times
previously.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
take
it
into
consideration,
your
honor,
only
because
the
arguments
which
he
said
he
wanted
to
make
had
been
previously
explored
and
the
judge
said
he
was
relying
on
his
prior
ruling.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
man
said
that
he
wanted
to
call
grand
jury
witnesses.
he
said
that
at
page
33
in
the
last
hearing
before
the
judge.
he
wanted
to
call
the
grand
jurors,
themselves.
he
was
harking
back
to
his
contention
that
the
grand
jury
wasn't
actually
investigating
what
it
said
it
was,
and
the
judge
had
repeatedly
ruled
that
“i'm
not
going
to
hear
that.
that
that
issue
is
not
open.
i'm
not
going
to
take
testimony
on
the
bona
fides
of
the
grand
jury's
purposes
in
conducting
this
inquiry.”
the
judge
had
taken
the
view
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
if
the
grand
jury
was
acting
under
its
apparent
authority
and
if
the
questions
which
it
was
asking
were
relevant
to
a
possible
permissible
purpose
within
that
authority,
that
then
the
petitioner
did
not
have
a
right
to
question
the
grand
jurors
or
to
show
by
other
means
that
the
grand
jurors
were
not
in
good
faith
or
were
not
doing
what
they
said
they
were.
he
ruled
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
therefore,
said
there
was
no
factual
issue
open.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
be.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he
said
the
judge
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
your
honor,
the
question
of
whether
it's
being
--
whether
this
proceeding
was
open
is
not
before
you,
i
say,
because
counsel
asked
this
question.
the
judge
said
it
is
open
and
then
he
accepted
that
to
all
appearances.
he
never
questioned
that
it
was
open
thereafter.
i
certainly
assume
that
a
lawyer
could
say,
if
the
judge
said
it's
open
and
it
wasn't
open,
he
could
say
for
the
record
that
he
did
not
believe
it
was
open.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
judge
said,
“this
proceeding
has
been
open
since
i
came
into
the
room.”
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
counsel
did
not
question
that
any
further
and
has
not
raised
the
question
in
the
appellate
proceedings
throughout.
so,
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
your
honor
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
my
argument,
your
honor,
is
that
he
presented
no
issue
of
fact
or
law
which
the
judge
did
not
consider
at
that
hearing.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he
heard
argument
of
counsel
and
concluded
that
there
was
no
issue
before
him
other
than
the
question
whether
this
man
had
refused
to
testify
and
whether
the
grand
jury
had
been
proceeding
within
its
apparent
authority.
he
said
there
was
no
disputed
question
of
fact
and
a
few
issue
of
law
before
him
and,
on
that
day
since
proceeding.
now,
if
this
were
--
had
been
a
42
(b)
hearing,
your
honor,
if
they
came
to
this
court
under
rule
42
(b)
and
had
proceeded
and
the
counsel
had
said,
“my
understanding
is
that
the
courtroom
door
is
locked
and
the
public
isn't
here.”
he
would
have
to
make
a
record
to
show
that
that
was
so.
now,
what
occurred
in
this
case,
i
think
was
that
having
been
before
the
grand
jury
and
then
having
adjourned
to
a
proceeding
before
the
judge,
counsel
was
not
aware
that
the
court
considered
the
court
to
be
open
when
it
came
into
the
room
and
took
over
the
proceeding.
and,
the
judge
said,
“this
is
open
and
has
been,”
and
so
the
court
records
reflect.
that's
all
we
have
to
go
on.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
that
--
i
assume
that
it
was
in
the
same
courtroom.
the
grand
jury
apparently,
had
been
using
a
courtroom
for
its
deliberation
and
i
take
it
what
took
place
is
that
the
judge
entered
the
courtroom
and
got
up
on
the
bench
and
took
over
the
proceeding
and
he
said
to
the
u.s.
attorney,
“go
ahead
and
bring
on
your
witnesses.”
the
u.s.
attorney
brought
on
the
grand
jury
reporter
and
she
testified
that
she
had
just
made
note
for
the
proceeding
that
had
taken
place
a
few
moments
before.
she
read
the
transcript
and
the
judge
proceeded
as
he
would
at
any
other
hearing.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
precise
contempt
is
through
a
refusal
to
answer
the
questions
before
the
grand
jury
as
directed
by
the
judge
in
his
presence
at
a
--
what
you
might
call
an
ancillary
proceeding
to
seek
to
get
his
testimony
for
the
grand
jury.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
court
said
in
the
brown
case
that
it
thought
it
permissible,
if
not
desirable,
procedure
to
use
the
authority
of
the
court
to
make
one
last
effort
to
get
the
witness
to
testify.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
it
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
that,
in
the
judge's
view,
that
the
proceeding
became
open
when
he
came
into
the
courtroom
and
took
the
bench,
i
assume,
and
this
is
not
something
i
can
spell
out
by
references
to
the
transcript.
i
assume
that
every
hearing
before
judge
mcclain,
at
which
he
called
this
petitioner
and
counsel
in,
was
an
open
proceeding.
i
assume
--
i
mean
by
that,
i
assume,
the
doors
of
the
court
were
open
and
anybody
could
walk
in.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
the
minute
entry
on
page
60.
now,
whether
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
whether
the
prior
--
what
the
prior
said
when
it
was
opened,
if
he
made
a
--
an
announcement,
i
don't
know
because
court
reporters
don't
normally
take
that
down.
the
record
--
the
minute
entry
shows
that
the
court
was
open
by
proclamation,
and
the
judge
said
it's
been
opened
for
the
last
few
minutes
when
counsel
expressed
to
believe
that
it
might
be
closed.
that
sums
up
as
to
the
record
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
on
the
point
of
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
that
is
so.
if
i
may
turn
to
the
last
point,
the
suggestion
which
comes
from
the
footnote
in
the
barnett
opinion
that
contempt
punishment
should
be
limited
to
those
associated
with
petty
offenses.
that
suggestion,
i
take
it
may
have
been
very
largely
prompted
by
the
historical
discussion
which
appeared
in
justice
goldberg's
dissent
in
the
barnett
case.
your
honors
will
recall
that
he
concluded
largely
on
the
basis
of
an
examination
of
five
colonial
statutes,
that
at
least
five
of
the
original
13
colonies
had
specific
statutory
limit
on
the
sanctions
for
contempt.
he
goes
on
to
state
that
some
of
the
other
colonies
adopted
limitations
after
the
ratification
of
the
constitution.
concluding
that
these
statutes
did
not
prescribe
severe
penalty,
he
suggests
that
the
colonies
may
have
regarded
contempt
as
akin
to
a
petty
offense
in
terms
of
the
punishments
which
might
be
imposed
therefore.
now,
responding
to
this
hypothesis,
we
have
undertaken
an
elaborate
study
of
the
colonial
statutes
and
precedents,
a
great
many
of
which
are
available
only
in
manuscript
form.
the
department
study
was
conducted
over
a
period
of
many
months
by
some
nice
or
10
lawyers
working
under
the
direction
of
joseph
smith,
a
professor
of
legal
history
at
columbia
who
is
with
me
today.
professor
smith
has
devoted
many
years
to
the
study
of
colonial
materials.
now,
the
results
of
this
study
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix.
because
of
the
relative
inaccessibility
of
the
materials,
we
have
endeavored
to
set
everything
down
rather
than
to
proceed
more
selectively.
in
the
brief
time
i
have
remaining,
i
cannot
begin
to
cover
all
of
the
detail.
i
shall
try
to
develop
in
broad
strokes
some
of
the
general
conclusions
which
we
think
are
warranted,
relying
upon
our
printed
documentations,
printed
appendix,
to
provide
further
documentation.
i'd
also
like
to
address
myself
with
some
particularity
to
the
statutory
materials,
upon
which
justice
goldberg
relied.
i
shall
point
out
that
we
think
there
were
very
serious
errors,
omissions,
and
misinterpretations
in
his
presentation.
i
hasten
to
add
that
the
reasons
for
that
are
quite
understandable,
the
materials
are
fragmentary,
and
they're
difficult
to
gather.
the
justice
did
not
have
any
briefing
on
this
point
and
he
obviously
didn't
have
the
time
and
the
facilities
for
an
exhaustive
study
such
as
we've
undertaken.
we've
shown
our
discussion
of
the
history
that,
first,
that
the
common
law
commentators
known
to
the
colonies
were
unanimous
in
their
view
that
contempt
was
punishable
by
fine
or
imprisonment
or,
in
some
instances,
by
corporal
punishment.
we
have
not
found
anything
in
any
of
the
commentators
to
suggest
that
the
power
was
thought
to
be
confined
to
the
imposition
of
trivial
penalties.
now,
this
is
of
some
importance
because
the
colonial
courts
were,
of
course,
guided
by
the
english
common
law
even
when
the
common
law
was
not
received
as
binding
upon
them.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
for
a
contempt?
we
found
--
i
intended
to
go
first
into
the
statutes
before
the
cases.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
was
referring
to
this
point,
your
honor,
to
the
common
--
we
didn't
find
any
commentators
who
suggested
that
it
was
confined.
they
spoke
of
fine
or
imprisonment
or
corporal
punishment
at
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
i
shall
come
--
i
shall
come
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
will.
let
me,
before
coming
to
the
cases,
say
generally
of
the
statutes
that
we
have
not
found
any
act
which
comprehensively
limited
the
power
to
punish
contempt
or
any
statute
which
set
a
maximum
for
willful
disobedience
of
an
injunction
or
a
decree
of
the
court.
there
were,
to
be
sure,
various
statutes
which
limited
the
punishment
which
might
be
imposed
for
specified
forms
of
contempt,
such
as
the
non-appearance
of
a
juror
or
the
use
of
profanity
in
the
courtroom.
kindly
turn
to
the
statutes
upon
which
mr.
justice
goldberg
relied
in
his
opinion
in
barnett,
he
stated
at
page
742
of
his
opinion,
that
the
south
caroline
statute
permitted
a
fine
not
exceeding
£10
for
any
contempt
by
word
or
gesture
and
a
fine
of
the
discretion
of
the
court
for
anyone
who
should
strike
or
use
any
violence
in
the
said
courts.
it
did
not
permit
imprisonment.
justice
goldberg's
citation
was
to
a
1731
act
dealing
with
misconducts
in
a
courtroom.
we
have
found
that
another
provision
of
the
same
statute
provides,
this
is
set
out
in
appendix
328,
that
if
a
witness
fails
to
appear
or
give
evidence
at
a
trial
for
a
felony,
he
shall
be
dealt
with
according
to
the
order
of
the
common
law.
still,
another
statute
which
was
not
noticed,
provided
for
a
£500
fine,
not
--
in
contrast
to
the
£10
fine
in
this
1731
statute,
a
£500
fine
for
a
grand
juror
who
willfully
failed
to
appear.
£500
was,
of
course
a
huge
sum
in
that
day
when
petty
offenses
were
characteristically
punished
by
fines
measured
in
shillings
or
a
few
pounds.
on
the
same
page
of
this
opinion,
justice
goldberg
referred
to
a
maryland
statute
of
1785
having
to
do
with
disobedience
of
the
courts
of
chancery,
and
he
stated
that
it
permitted
no
punishment
exceeding
£10
current
money.
our
examination
shows
that
this
provision
is
actually
one
relating
to
civil
contempt
and
that
the
£10
provision
has
to
do
with
purgation
of
that
contempt.
the
very
statute
which
was
cited
provides
that
another
point,
and
here,
dealing
with
criminal
contempt,
that
the
chancellor
may
impose
indefinite
mprisonment
for
disobedience
of
his
rule,
order,
or
decree.
an
earlier
maryland
statute
noticed
last
term
or
two
terms
ago
dealing
with
violent
misconduct
in
the
courtroom
authorized
any
corporal
punishment
not
extending
to
the
taking
of
life,
which
the
court
might
see
fit
to
impose.
in
1788,
maryland
statute
provided
for
£100
penalty
for
a
sheriff
who
failed
to
secure
proper
jurors.
this
was
a
monetary
penalty
far
and
excess
to
that
associated
with
petty
offenses
in
the
colonies
or
permitted
under
the
maryland
petty
offense
act.
in
the
case
of
connecticut,
justice
goldberg
referred
to
a
1667
statute
which
authorized,
in
the
case
of
courtroom
misconduct,
such
punishment
as
the
court
might
have
judged
most
suitable.
and
then,
he
found
significance
in
a
proviso
which
limited
to
a
small
fine
or
to
two
hours
in
the
stocks,
the
punishment
which
a
single
judge
might
impose
for
such
a
contempt.
this
provision
does
not
apply
to
all
contempts.
more
pointedly,
it
has
no
application
whenever
two
or
more
judges
sit
in
a
case,
which
was
commonly
the
situation
in
the
connecticut
colonies
above
the
justice
of
the
peace
level.
we
have
additionally
pointed
to
passages
from
writings
of
the
chief
justice
of
connecticut,
zephania
swift,
which
spoke
unequivocally
of
the
plenary
power
of
contempt
enjoined
by
the
connecticut
court.
the
fourth
colony
that
justice
goldberg
referred
to
was
new
hampshire.
he
cited
in
his
opinion,
enacted
february
9,
1791,
which
permitted
imprisonment
for
contempt
not
exceeding
10
days
or
a
fine
of
£10.
this
provision
related
to
non-appearance
of
a
witness.
it
did
not
relate
to
contempts
generally.
and,
as
we
show,
new
hampshire
had
numerous
other
statutes.
for
example,
wholly
discretionary
punishments
were
authorized
by
statutes
relating
to
the
abuse
of
court
officials
and
misconducts
in
court.
indeed,
on
february
16,
1791,
one
week
after
the
passage
of
the
statute
to
which
the
justice
referred,
the
new
hampshire
legislature
provided
for
imprisonment
up
to
12
months
and
a
fine
of
£90
for
interference
with
service
of
court
practice.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
none
of
them
deal
with
the
procedure
one
way
or
the
other,
except
insofar
as
might
--
one
might
infer
from
certain
terminology
in
the
statute
if
a
word
like
“attachment”
is
used
as
is
true
in
some
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
say
there
is
nothing
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
we
show
by
the
cases
that
the
--
they
were
not
jury
cases
with
such
rare
exceptions
as
we
have
noted.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
are
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
these
statutes
do
not.
these
--
i've
been
referring
to
these
statutes
in
terms
of
the
punishment
which
might
be
involved
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
at
this
point,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
i
intended
to
go
further
into
the
history.
i
think
i
shall
have
to
leave
that
to
the
brief
in
due
of
the
fact
that
my
time
has
almost
expired.
i
did
want
to
get
back
to
the
question
which
your
honor
asked
about
what
the
cases
showed
in
the
way
of
punishment.
the
great
majority
of
the
cases,
the
punishments
were
trivial.
we
have
--
we
don't
for
a
moment
deny
that
that
is
so.
most
contempts
then,
as
now,
are,
i
suppose,
trivial.
i
suppose
that
there
are
20
cases
today
in
which
somebody
is
punished
by
a
fine
for
every
case
in
which
imprisonment
is
imposed
but,
throughout
the
colonial
period,
we
have
demonstrated,
i
think
by
this
appendix,
one
finds
a
regular
sprinkling
of
cases
in
which
the
punishment
was
far
and
excess
of
that
which
was
associated
with
or
permissible
under
those
colony
statutes
for
petty
offenses.
imprisonment
in
the
colonies
was
of
course,
rare.
it
was
rare
in
the
case
of
felonies,
as
well
as
in
the
case
of
contempts
or
any
other
offenses.
it
was
apparently
not
considered
a
sound
political
economy
to
put
people
in
jail
and
to
have
other
people
watch
over
them.
the
penalties
were
ordinarily
fines,
whereas,
in
the
case
of
petty
offenses,
it
appears
that
the
outer
limit
was
probably
about
£10
for
petty
offenses
in
most
of
the
colonies.
we
have
found
cases
of
contempt,
numerous
cases
in
which
the
penalties
were
£20,
£40,
£50,
£100,
and
even
£200
for
contempt.
there
are
cases
of
corporal
--
severe
corporal
punishment
as
well,
particularly
in
the
earlier
period.
other
penalties
were
occasionally
imposed,
such
as
banishment
or
a
substantial
loss
of
privilege.
jail
sentences,
as
i
say,
were
relatively
rare
in
the
colonies
and
that's
cruel
crimes,
as
well
as
of
contempt.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
expect
they
might
have
put
him
in
jail
then.
they
did
put
people
in
jail
for
debt.
usually,
it
seems
that
when
they
put
people
in
jail,
it
was
exceptional
and
it
was
for
relatively
short
periods
and
i
suspect
because
they
didn't
want
to
maintain
penitentiaries.
other
forms
of
punishment,
corporal
punishment
were
of
course
used
on
occasion
in
the
colony.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
have
not
--
we
have
not
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
have
not
found
any
case
where
there
was
a
contempt
in
the
presence
of
the
court
or
a
disobedience
of
the
writ
of
report
where
it
appears
that
a
jury
trial
was
hired.
there
are
several
cases
in
which
there
was
what
was
then
called
a
constructive
contempt
committed
outside
the
presence
of
the
court,
perhaps
blaspheming
a
judge
in
which
it
appears
that
there
was
a
jury
trial.
there
are
a
few
cases
in
the
new
england
colonies
where
they
had
an
offense
known
as
contempt
of
authority
which
was
apparently
their
form
of
sedition
which
was
indicted
by
grand
jury
and
tried
by
petty
jury.
there
are
a
few
cases
in
which
the
contempt
was
apparently
an
independent
crime
or
coupled
with
a
crime
and
it
was
tried
by
jury.
in
the
overwhelming
number
of
instances
and
without
exception
where
the
contempt
was
in
the
court's
presence
or
was
in
disobedience
of
the
courts'
order,
without
exception,
it
appears
that
it
was
a
non-jury
proceeding,
irrespective
of
the
punishment
which
was
imposed,
your
honor.
that's
our
conclusion
from
this
material.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
the
courts
--
well,
i
would
suppose,
before
there
was
any
contempt
there
would
have
to
be
some
implementation
of
the
statute
by
a
judicial
order
of
some
kind.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
would
seem
to
me
inevitable
that
such
a
statute
would
have
to
be
implemented
by
the
asking
of
particular
question
than
a
direction
by
a
judge,
and
i
would
think,
if
the
statute
called
for
a
judge's
intervention
for
some
order
of
the
judge
and
there
was
non-compliance,
that
that
would
be
a
contempt
punishable
by
the
court
unless
congress
chose
to
establish
some
statutory
penalty.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i'm
not.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
we
are
seeking
any
taking
cases
out
of
the
normal
body
of
criminal
law
which
are
in
there
or
expanding
the
types
of
cases
in
which
injunctions
are
sought
--
injunctions
are
to
be
issued.
i
was
suggesting
that,
in
cases
where
the
courts
have
found
it
necessary
to
issue
an
injunction
in
relation
to
a
specific
crystallized
controversy
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
because
there
is
an
emergency
or
a
threat
of
injury
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
agree
with
your
honor
completely
that
in
a
case
of
a
criminal
statute,
that
cannot
be
converted
into
a
non-jury
proceeding.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
judge
does
more
than
add
his
statement,
if
i
may
say
so,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
but
i
was
--
i
do
think
that
where
a
judge
issues
an
injunction,
and
it
of
course
has
to
be
a
valid
injunction
or
it
can
be
set
aside,
if
a
judge
issues
an
injunction,
he
has
made
a
determination
that
there
is
an
immediate
threat
of
irreparable
injury.
injunction
is
an
extraordinary
remedy
designed
to
protect
rights,
and
i
think
that
that
presents
different
problems
of
enforcement
and
administration
and
has
historically
been
treated
as
different
since
the
very
existence
of
the
chancellor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
are
both
orders,
i
agree.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
indeed.
i'm
not
suggesting
a
broadening
of
the
instances
in
which
injunctive
power
is
used.
i
am
suggesting
that,
in
the
narrow
class,
injunctions
are
the
exception.
there
has
to
be
an
extraordinary
showing,
normally,
to
entitle
one
to
an
injunction.
i
am
suggesting
that
in
the
narrow
class
of
cases
where
injunctions
are
necessary
and
appropriate
and
are
validly
issued,
that
i
do
think
it
important
in
that
class
of
cases
that
the
power
of
the
court
to
vindicate
the
order
which
is
written
into
that
injunction
should
not
depend,
as
this
court
put
it
in
another
day,
upon
the
submission
of
the
question
of
obedience
to
another
tribunal.
i
do
think
it
is
important
for
the
judge
to
be
able
to
carry
it
out.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
agree
on
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
it's
more
than
an
addition
of
a
sanction,
your
honor.
as
i
view
it,
the
court's
power
to
issue
an
injunction
or
decree
presents
a
considerably
different
problem
than
a
statute
at
large.
this
is
an
order
directed
to
a
particular
controversy
which
has
been
thoroughly
litigated
and
a
specific
order
has
been
issued
to
deal
with
a
situation
which
had
extraordinary
attributes
that
a
threat
of
their
irreparable
injury
perhaps,
some
kind
of
emergency,
some
kind
of
threat
of
interference
with
the
rights
of
the
person
who
is
seeking
the
injunction.
the
court
has
made
determinations.
the
court's
authority
has
crystallized
in
the
form
of
a
specific
order
directed
to
a
specific
controversy
and
served
upon
specific
parties.
now,
i
think
the
implementation
of
such
an
order,
if
it's
flouted,
does
present
very
serious
problems
of
judicial
administration
and
that
if
at
all
such
cases
jury
trials
were
required,
i
think
those
problems
would
be
granted.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
my
opponent
mentioned
civil
rights
cases.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
power
to
implement
it
--
i
am
not
arguing
the
case
upon
the
basis
of
any
one
category
of
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
i'm
sorry,
we're
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
only
meant
to
say,
your
honor,
apparently
i
didn't
make
myself
clear,
that
i
am
not
--
my
case
does
not
depend
upon
and
i
am
not
seeking
to
single
out
civil
rights
cases
from
other
cases
involving
the
entry
of
injunctions.
i
am
certainly
standing
upon
the
decision
of
the
court
in
green
and
in
barnett.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
punishment
is
a
set
of
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
merely
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
merely
making
two
arguments,
if
i
may
say
so.
the
argument
in
favor
of
the
practice
which
has
always
existed
and
i'm
not
arguing
for
a
new
rule.
i'm
arguing
only
for
the
continuation
of
a
rule
from
which
this
court
has
never
got
departed.
my
first
argument
is
that
the
court
should
not
depart
from
its
traditional
holding
that
jury
trials
are
not
required
as
of
right
in
contempt
cases
and
i
was
saying
that
we
attach
particular
importance
to
that
principle
because
we
think
that
the
authority
of
the
federal
courts
would
be
impaired
in
many
situations
if
they
could
not
take
steps
to
implement
their
own
decrees,
but
that's
conducting
jury
proceedings.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
case
in
which
one-
and
two-
and
three-year
sentences
are
justified
are
perhaps
very
few.
i
do
have
to
--
mr.
ralph
s.

i
don't

mr.
ralph

the

petitioner
argued
that
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
sure,
your
court
could
look
at
the
sentence
and
i
don't
deny
that
it
can.
and,
i'm
not
particularly
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
it
is
probably
a
fairly
heavy
sentence
and
i'm
not
particularly
concerned
if
the
court
would
think
that
six
months
or
nine
months
was
a
more
appropriate
sentence.
that's
not
our
concern
here.
i
do
wish
to
say,
however,
that
in
considering
the
severity
of
the
sentence,
i
think
your
honor
should
take
into
account
that
this
judge
did
write
into
the
sentence
what
amounted
to
a
provision
for
perjury.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
right.
that
the
grand
jury
might
expire.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this,
in
one
way,
may
have
been
a
lighter
sentence
than
a
civil
contempt
because
if
he
had
said
“i'm
going
to
put
you
in
jail
until
you
testify”
and
hadn't
granted
bail,
then
the
man
would've
been
in
jail
during
the
course
of
the
appeal
which
would
have
taken
many
months.
instead,
he
granted
bail
and
said,
“if
i'm
wrong
on
the
law,
the
court
of
appeals
tells
me
i'm
wrong
on
the
law
and
that
you
didn't
have
full
immunity,
you'll
be
protected,
you
will
not
have
served.
if
i'm
right
on
the
law
and
you
do
have
to
testify,
you
can
still
testify
and
then
come
back
and
i
will
reduce
the
sentence."
