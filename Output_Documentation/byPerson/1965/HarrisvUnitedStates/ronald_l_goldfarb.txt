mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presented
the
court
with
the
opportunity
to
deal
with
two
important
and
quite
disputed,
specially
recently
quite
disputed
areas
in
the
law
of
contempt.
they
are
first
the
procedures
governing
grand
jury
contempts
and
particularly
rule
42
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedures
and
secondly,
the
right
to
trial
by
a
jury
for
criminal
contempts
when
the
sentences
are
severe.
before
dealing
with
these
two
subjects,
i
would
like
to
briefly
summarize
the
facts
which
gave
rise
to
this
contempt
conviction.
in
july
of
1963,
the
petitioner
was
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury
of
the
south
district
of
new
york.
his
subpoena
specified
that
the
grand
jury
was
investigating
under
the
general
conspiracy,
criminal
conspiracy
statute.
he
appeared,
answered
certain
preliminary
questions
and
then
refused
to
answer
a
group
of
questions
invoking
his
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment.
the
government
counsel
offered
petitioner
immunity
under
title
47
of
the
u.s.
code,
the
federal
communications
act,
the
petitioner
nonetheless
refused
to
answer
the
questions
and
continued
to
invoke
his
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment,
whereupon
he
was
asked
to
leave
the
grand
jury
room,
the
district
court
judge
was
brought
in
and
his
aid
and
assistance
was
sought
by
the
government
counsel
for
the
grand
jury.
the
judge
was
not
certain
whether
or
not
he
could
in
fact
give
the
immunity
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
adjourned
till
the
next
day,
advising
the
petitioner
that
he
should
come
at
that
time
with
counsel.
on
the
following
day,
the
petitioner
appeared
in
the
courtroom
before
the
judge
and
government
counsel
without
the
grand
jury
and
after
some
colloquy
in
which
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
expressed
some
reluctance
to
appear
and
stated
that
he
wasn't
quite
ready,
the
judge
dismissed
the
proceeding
because
he
felt
at
that
time
that
he
couldn't
truly
give
the
immunity
that
the
government
counsel
had
spoken
of.
a
week
later,
in
august
of
1963,
the
petitioner
was
subpoenaed
again
and
appeared
again
and
appeared
before
the
same
grand
jury
and
the
same
government
counsel.
under
the
subpoena
which
this
time
mentioned
an
investigation
into
title
47
of
the
communications
act.
again
he
was
asked
a
series
of
questions,
some
of
which
were
essentially
the
same
as
he
had
already
been
asked
a
week
before
and
some
of
them
were
a
continuation
of
those
questions
and
again,
refused
invoking
his
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
at
this
point,
he
was
taken
with
the
grand
jury
by
the
government
counsel
before
the
court
and
the
court's
aid
and
assistance
was
again
requested.
the
judge
again
discussed
with
counsel
whether
counsel
was
prepared
to
undertake
this
case
and
the
counsel
was
quite
reluctant
to
appear.
the
judge
again
not
certain
whether
or
not
he
could
invoke
or
whether
or
not
he
could
in
fact
give
immunity
under
title
47
adjourned
the
proceedings,
so
that
he
could
read
the
transcript
of
a
case
which
was
he
felt
dispositive
of
his
power
in
this
regard.
the
following
morning,
the
judge,
grand
jury
and
lawyers
again
reassembled
in
the
grand
jury
room,
which
was
specifically
stated
in
the
record
as
being
used
an
extension
of
the
grand
jury
proceeding.
the
judge
at
this
point
ordered
the
petitioner
to
answer
the
questions
that
had
been
put
to
him
before
the
grand
jury.
then
the
judge
and
the
petitioner's
counsel
left
the
courtroom
and
he
was
re-asked
the
questions
by
the
government
counsel.
again,
he
refused
to
answer
the
questions,
at
this
point
completing
his
contempt
of
court
if
any
there
was.
after
he
was
asked
the
questions
and
again
refused
to
answer
under
the
fifth
amendment
grounds,
the
judge
and
the
petitioner's
counsel
came
back
into
the
courtroom.
they
were
appraised
by
the
government
counsel
of
what
had
happened,
what
had
ensued
while
they
were
out
and
again
the
government
counsel
asked
the
court
to
order
to
witness
to
testify.
at
this
point,
at
the
request
of
the
government
counsel,
the
court
put
the
witness
on
the
stand,
swore
the
witness
with
the
grand
jury
present,
with
the
government
counsel
present
and
still
somewhat
reluctant
petitioner's
counsel
present,
re-asked
him
the
same
questions,
advised
him
that
he
would
not
consider
his
fifth
amendment
defense
because
he
was
giving
him
immunity,
asked
him
if
he
understood
that,
petitioner
nonetheless
respectfully
declined
to
answer
on
the
grounds
that
he
felt
he
could
be
--
he
would
be
incriminating
himself.
at
this
point,
the
government
asked
the
court
to
proceed
under
rule
42(a)
and
find
the
petitioner
in
contempt
in
the
presence
of
the
court.
at
this
point,
the
petitioner's
counsel
who
had
been
lead
to
believe
in
the
prior
proceedings
that
he
would
not
necessarily
be
involved
in
a
contempt
proceeding,
rose
and
said,
and
i
would
like
to
now
refer
to
page
32
and
33
of
the
transcript,
because
on
this
page-and-a-half
is
an
example
of
startlingly
summary
proceeding.
what
petitioner
will
urge
is,
is
the
very
reason
why
rule
42(a)
should
not
apply
in
cases
like
this.
at
this
point,
we
pick
up
in
the
middle
of
page
32,
we
find
the
judge
and
the
petitioner's
counsel
having
come
back
into
the
courtroom
after
the
witness
had
been
ordered
to
testify
and
had
refused
and
at
this
point,
had
committed
his
contempt
of
court
if
there
was
one.
the
court
says
after
directing
the
witness
to
testify
again
at
the
request
of
the
government
counsel,
anything
further,
the
government
counsel
said
no
and
requested
the
court
to
proceed
under
rule
42(a).
at
this
point,
the
petitioner's
counsel
said
“your
honor,
if
this
is
a
contempt
proceeding,
i
respectfully
request
an
adjournment.
i
want
to
have
the
minutes
and
i
want
to
have
an
opportunity
to
discuss
them
and
consider
them
with
my
client
and
look
up
the
law.
i
further
request
your
honor
a
hearing
where
i
will
be
permitted
to
call
witnesses,
perhaps
a
grand
juror
too,
perhaps
the
places
where
the
phone
calls
allegedly
were
made”.
he
goes
on
to
discuss
possible
violation
under
the
communications
act
and
whether
or
not
it
was
truly
appropriate.
he
said
“i
haven't
been
told
that
there
is
any
tariff
that's
been
violated,
no
law
has
been
cited
to
me
and
i
would
also
request
that
the
proceeding
be
held
in
public”
and
here
we
have
in
the
court's
response,
the
complete
adjudication
in
this
case
of
a
man's
guilt
of
contempt.
your
request
is
denied.
this
is
a
contempt
committed
in
open
court
and
i
adjudge
the
defendant
guilty
of
a
criminal
contempt
under
rule
42(a),
that
was
it.
further
down
in
the
page,
there
is
an
equally
summary
sentencing
procedure
in
which
after
the
first
--
the
adjudication
of
contempt
by
the
court,
the
counsel
said
“but
your
honor,
this
is
not
open
to
the
--
is
this
open
to
the
public?
this
rule
has
been
sealed.”
the
court
said,
“no,
we
opened
a
few
minutes
ago.”
well,
i
will
get
to
that
in
a
minute.
then
he
follows
by
saying
that
“i
adjudge
mr.
harris
guilty
of
contempt
of
court
and
sentence
him
to
imprisonment
for
a
term
of
one
year.”
this
was
the
complete
adjudication
and
sentencing
of
an
individual
to
prison
for
one
year.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
yes
indeed
mr.
justice
harlan.
later
on
when
there
was
a
discussion
about
bail,
which
by
the
way
is
not
so
far
as
i
can
--
so
far
as
rule
42(a)
states,
it
is
confined
to
rule
42(b)
and
not
42(a),
but
nonetheless
when
they
did
discuss
bail,
the
judge
said
that
he
would
consider
if
the
witness
testified
in
the
future,
a
motion
to
reconsider
the
sentencing.
with
regard
to
that,
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
one
of
the
gompers
cases,
i
believe
it's
233
u.s.,
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
a
statement
--
a
gratuitous
statement
like
this
does
not
in
anyway
convert
a
criminal
contempt
to
a
civil
contempt.
although
the
government
argues
that
it
makes
it
in
the
nature
of
a
more
coercive
contempt
that
we
are
dealing
in
this
case
and
the
judge
specifically
states
the
different
points
in
the
record
that
this
is
a
criminal
contempt.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
your
honor,
the
record
as
i
interpret
it
indicates
that
this
proceeding
was
closed.
the
lower
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
it
was
an
open
proceeding.
i
can
only
suggest
to
your
honor
that
a
complete
scrutiny
of
the
record
indicates
only
two
places
where
it
could
possibly
be
a
basis
for
finding
that
it
was
open.
one,
in
the
statement
of
the
judge,
which
is
part
of
his
adjudication,
your
request
is
denied,
this
is
contempt
committed
in
open
court,
but
this
came
right
after
they
came
walking
in
through
the
doors,
it
could
only
have
been
moments.
and
certainly
when
the
grand
jury
was
there
and
he
was
being
asked
the
questions
by
the
government
counsel,
it
could
not
have
been
an
open
proceeding,
it
was
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
so
there
is
in
the
record
only
this
statement
by
the
court,
this
is
open.
and
then
later
on,
he
says
in
response
to
the
accusation
that
it
was
--
the
doors
were
sealed,
well
i
opened
it
a
moment
ago.
there
is
also
in
the
record
a
--
i
believe
it's
on
page
60
of
the
record,
a
docket
entry
or
a
minute
record
of
the
clerk,
it
can
found
at
page
60
of
the
record,
indicating
that
in
the
title
of
the
case,
and
this
is
a
formal
paper
that's
filled
in
by
the
clerk
of
the
court
each
day,
it
says
the
court
meets
and
is
opened
by
a
proclamation.
well,
the
record
of
that
proceeding
shows
no
proclamation.
the
most
i
should
think
can
be
said
for
the
openness
of
this
proceeding
is
that
if
it
was,
it
was
the
most
technical
opening
and
indeed
the
record
indicates
that
it
really
wasn't
an
open
proceeding.
indeed
it
could
be
argued
that
this
kind
of
question
about
whether
or
not
it
was
truly
open
underscores
the
very
complaint
that
the
petitioner
has
and
others
have
had
with
rule
42(a),
in
that
the
proceedings
moved
so
swiftly
that
in
this
case
no
one
could
really
have
been
there
if
they
wanted
to.
at
the
most,
you
could
say
it
was
a
technical
opening,
but
the
record
really
argues
against
that.
now
the
government
argued
in
its
brief
that
for
anyone
who
was
truly
interested
they
would
have
known.
well
the
government,
the
petitioner's
counsel
didn't
even
know.
he
stood
up
in
court
and
said
“your
honor
the
doors
are
sealed,
this
should
be
an
open
proceeding.”
obviously,
he
wouldn't
have
said
this
if
there
were
people
in
the
courtroom.
for
anyone
who
was
a
member,
for
example,
if
petitioner's
family
or
anyone
who
was
a
member
of
the
press
or
anyone
who
wanted
to
observe
these
proceedings,
the
only
way
they
could
have
known
would
be
if
they
were
trying
constantly
to
get
in
the
door
and
at
the
moment
the
door
was
unsealed,
which
would
have
been
after
the
judge
and
the
petitioner's
counsel
came
back
in,
if
they
kind
of
came
through
as
he
said
the
magic
words,
i
refuse
--
i
deny
your
request,
this
is
an
open
proceeding,
but
other
than
that,
really
i
don't
see
how
anybody
could
be
in
that
proceeding.
in
any
event
on
april
19th
of
last
year,
1964,
this
court
issued
its
decision
in
united
states
against
barnett.
in
july
of
1964,
the
second
circuit
affirmed
the
petitioner's
conviction
in
sentence,
noticing
this
court's
footnote
in
the
barnett
case,
but
not
conforming
to
it
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
dictum.
petition
of
rehearing
was
later
denied.
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
was
filed
in
september
of
1964
and
was
granted
in
december
of
1964.
with
regard
to
rule
42(a)
and
rule
42(b),
the
petitioner's
contention
can
be
put
very
succinctly.
rule
42(a)
is
an
unusual
proceeding.
it
should
be
used
in
cases
involving
a
disruption
and
a
misbehavior
in
the
presence
of
the
court.
the
kinds
of
misconduct
in
the
court's
view
that
might
tend
to
moralize
the
court
or
make
it
difficult
for
the
court
to
proceed
truly
the
kind
of
misconduct,
whereas
rule
42(b)
applies
in
all
other
cases
and
specifically
with
regard
to
disobedience
of
the
court
orders.
i
suggest
that
a
reading
of
rule
42,
a
literal
reading
in
any
event
makes
this
quite
clear.
it
starts
by
saying
that
summary
proceedings
under
rule
42(a)
may
be
punished
summarily
if
the
judge
certifies
that
he
saw
or
heard
the
conduct
constituting
the
contempt
that
it
was
committed
in
the
actual
presence
of
the
court.
the
use
of
the
word
may
as
this
court
as
already
indicated,
meaning
that
it
isn't
a
word
of
command,
but
this
is
an
alternative
that
the
court
has,
but
when
you
have
a
rule
42(b)
case,
the
language
becomes
a
language
of
command.
it
says
that
in
all
other
cases
the
contempt
shall
be
prosecuted
on
notice
and
hearing.
in
this
case,
if
there
was
a
contempt,
it
was
contempt
after
the
court
had
ordered
the
witness
to
testify
in
the
courtroom
and
the
witness
had
refused
to.
that
was
a
42(b)
case
and
under
the
rules
of
--
under
the
language
of
rule
42(b),
it
shall
be
prosecuted
upon
notice
and
hearing.
now
that
could
be
also
read
in
line
with
rule
6
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
i
don't
think
that
this
court
did
consider
this.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
brown
or
levine
cases,
which
so
far
govern
this
point.
rule
6
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
defines
in
very
emphatic
terms
who
may
be
present
in
grand
jury
proceeding.
rule
6
states
who
may
be
present,
(d)
attorneys
for
the
government
maybe
present,
the
witness
under
examination
maybe
present,
interpreters
when
needed
maybe
present
and
a
stenographer,
but
no
other
person
than
the
jurors
maybe
present.
now
in
this
case,
we
have
the
unorthodox
practice
of
the
--
of
petitioner's
counsel
being
there
at
some
point.
we
also
have,
but
it
could
be
argued
that
he
did
not
object
to
this,
but
the
point
i
make
is
this.
i
question
whether
under
rule
6
it
is
proper
for
the
judge
to
be
in
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
now
under
the
rule
of
the
brown
case,
the
trial
court
judge
may
convert
what
is
a
contempt
in
the
presence
of
the
grand
jury
without
him
into
a
contempt
in
his
presence
by
asking,
re-asking
him
the
same
question
in
his
presence.
i
suggest
that
under
rule
6,
it
would
really
be
an
illegality
for
there
to
be
testimony
in
response
to
the
court's
questions.
in
other
words
i'm
saying,
the
power
of
the
judge
to
aid
the
grand
jury
does
not
in
anyway
change
the
independence
of
the
grand
jury.
so
that
the
court
can
order
the
witness
to
testify,
but
he
can
order
him
to
testify
in
the
grand
jury
and
not
before
the
court.
so
that
i
question
whether
or
not
the
literal
reading
of
rule
6
might
just
undercut
completely,
the
rule
which
has
so
far
allowed
under
this
court's
decision
in
brown
against
the
united
states.
in
any
event
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
precisely
sir.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
yes,
that
was
the
holding
indeed,
the
brown
case,
the
question
i
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
i
think
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
i
think
that
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
you
may
think
that
it
is
implicit
in
that,
but
i
would
argue
that
it
was
not
raised
at
the
time
and
that
if
rule
6
does
mean
what
i
suggest
it
means,
then
notwithstanding
the
opinion
in
the
brown
case,
that
kind
of
a
procedure
is
impossible.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
well
this
--
petitioner
urges
that
this
court
do
overrule
the
brown
case
although
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
if
the
court
does
not
want
to
go
that
far,
the
court
could
distinguish
this
case
because
in
levine
which
followed
the
brown
case,
the
court
specifically
said
that
the
levine
case
was
a
replica
in
every
regard
of
the
brown
case,
except
one,
and
in
that
case
the
argument
was
made
in
levine
that
it
wasn't
a
public
proceeding.
the
court
disposed
of
that
by
saying
it
was
an
afterthought
and
that
petitioner
hadn't
raised
it,
but
if
he
had
it
would
have
raised
questions
either
under
the
sixth
amendment's
requirement
for
a
public
proceeding
or
the
fifth
amendment's
requirement
of
due
process.
but
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
it
was
not
raised
and
that
this
is
not
that
case,
was
the
words
of
justice
frankfurt.
if
this
court
does
not
want
to
overrule
the
brown
case,
they
could
still
overrule
this
conviction
by
saying
that
this
indeed
is
that
case,
because
the
objection
was
timely
raised
in
the
instant
case.
in
any
event,
the
cases
which
lead
up
to
the
promulgation
of
rule
42,
particularly
the
ex
parte
terry
which
was
decided
by
former
justice
harlan
in
cooke
against
the
united
states,
an
opinion
by
mr.
chief
justice,
former
chief
justice
taft,
make
it
quite
clear
that
42(a)
is
reserved
for
misconduct
and
42(b)
is
the
general
rule
under
which
an
individual
should
be
proceeded
against.
when
mr.
justice
clark
was
attorney
general
and
this
rule
was
passed,
he
urged
in
his
preface
to
the
promulgation
of
that
rule
that
it
be
respected
with
the
full
measure
of
intent
and
spirit
of
the
writers.
i
suggest
that
the
rule
of
the
brown
case
does
not
do
that
and
that
the
court
should
consider
instead
that
if
there
is
one
word
that
might
describe
the
procedures
under
rule
42(a)
in
general
and
in
this
case
in
particular,
that
the
word
is
not
justice,
the
word
is
precipitous,
the
word
is
unfair
and
perhaps
the
word
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
yes
sir.
i
think
the
wisdom
of
your
remark
at
that
time
is
perfectly
apt
today
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
with
regard
--
passing
from
the
question
of
grand
jury
procedures
in
rule
42
to
the
question,
the
right
to
trial
by
a
jury,
i
would
state
first
that
the
petitioner's
position
in
this
case
is
alternative.
petitioner
urges
that
the
court
reconsider
its
prior
rulings
and
rule
that
all
criminal
contempts
indeed
today
are
treated
in
every
other
respect
as
crimes.
to
recognize
the
trend
of
congressional
and
judicial
treatment
of
criminal
contempt
has
recognized
this
and
once
and
for
all
allow
the
constitutional
privileges
as
that
apply
to
all
other
crimes.
petitioner
suggests
that
--
i
will
not
go
into
great
detail
because
this
court
had
has
full
dressed
discussions
on
this
point
before
and
i
won't
attempt
to
paraphrase
the
words
of
mr.
justice
black
in
the
green
case,
because
to
paraphrase
them
would
be
to
do
an
injustice,
but
that
is
the
position
that
the
petitioner
takes
in
this
case.
but
if
the
court
will
not
go
that
far,
the
petitioner
urges
that
nonetheless
it
should
limit
the
sentences
for
criminal
contempt
as
suggested
in
the
footnote
of
the
dictum
in
the
barnett
case,
so
that
there
cannot
be
summary
convictions
where
sentences
exceed
six
months.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
yes
mr.
justice
stewart
and
this
is
suggested
and
this
was
suggested
by
mr.
justice
harlan
in
the
green
case
and
it
was
pointed
out
by
the
government
in
their
brief.
it's
my
suggestion
and
i
would
urge
it
upon
the
court
now
that
this
is
an
unrealistic
right.
if
the
man
has
a
constitutional
right,
he
has
it
not
as
a
matter
of
grace,
as
a
matter
of
being
monitored
by
the
appellate
courts,
but
he
has
the
right
and
he
can
claim
it
at
the
very
start.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
if
it's
a
criminal
prosecution
and
not
a
petty
offense.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
the
court
could
decide
this
--
the
court
could
adopt
the
barnett
dictum
either
under
its
supervisory
power
or
on
constitutional
grounds,
holding
that
where
contempts
are
treated
as
crimes
and
not
petty
offenses,
then
the
constitutional
guarantees
for
other
--
for
crimes
in
general
would
apply
or
i
suggest
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
adjourned
yesterday,
i
had
concluded
my
discussion
of
rule
42
and
had
begun
to
discuss
the
issue
of
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
for
criminal
contempts
with
severe
sentences.
picking
up
at
that
point
again
this
morning,
i
could
do
no
better
than
to
begin
by
referring
to
the
particular
provisions
of
the
constitution
which
apply
to
this
argument.
article
3
section
2
states
that
the
trial
of
all
crimes,
except
in
the
case
of
impeachment,
shall
be
by
jury.
the
sixth
amendment
guarantees
a
public
and
speedy
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
in
all
criminal
prosecutions.
this
court,
throughout
history,
has
treated
contempt
in
various
ways
at
different
times
but,
consistently,
it
has
treated
contempt
as
a
crime.
in
the
gompers
case,
which
i
mentioned
yesterday,
it
considered
criminal
contempt
a
crime
for
the
purposes
of
invocation
of
the
statute
of
limitations
for
crimes.
in
ex
parte
grossman,
this
court
considered
criminal
contempt
to
crime
for
the
purposes
of
the
use
of
the
pardon
power
of
the
president.
in
the
creekmore
case,
creekmore
against
the
united
states,
this
court
considered
criminal
contempt
a
crime,
insofar
as
classifying
the
contemnor
as
a
convict.
in
the
new
orleans
steam
shift
case,
criminal
contempt
was
called
by
this
court
a
criminal
offense.
in
the
gompers
case,
this
court
held
that
the
right
to
counsel
and
compulsory
process
applied
to
criminal
contempt.
indeed,
the
statutes
hold
that,
if
contempt
may
be
inherently
another
crime
as
well
such
as
perjury
or
obstruction
of
justice,
there
again,
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
applies.
but
this
court
has
hesitated
to
take
the
one
final
step
and
say
that
contempt
is
indeed
a
crime
as
envisioned
by
article
3
and
by
the
sixth
amendment,
and
therefore,
it
warrants
trial
by
jury
in
all
cases.
this
issue
was
dealt
within
the
gompers
case,
233
united
states,
by
mr.
justice
holmes.
and
in
dealing
with
this
case
which
is
very
ap
--
could
be
the
very
appellee
applied
to
the
instant
case,
mr.
justice
holmes
with
his
very
special
ability
to
succinctly
and
brilliantly
see
through
a
complicated
matter
and
describe
it
as
clearly
as
anyone,
said
the
following,
and
i
might
add,
that
this
case
also
involved
the
sixth
amendment
in
having
to
do
with
the
right
to
the
application
of
the
statute
of
limitations
for
crimes
in
general
to
criminal
contempts
and
the
contempt
in
this
case
also
involves
disobedience
of
a
court's
order.
mr.
justice
holmes
said,
“these
contempts
are
infractions
of
the
law,
visited
with
punishment
as
such.
if
such
acts
are
not
criminal,
we
are
in
error
as
to
the
most
fundamental
character
of
crimes
as
that
word
has
been
understood
in
english
speech.
so
truly
are
they
crimes,
that
it
seems
to
be
proved
that
in
the
early
law,
they
were
punished
only
by
the
usual
criminal
procedures.”
and
yet,
this
court
and
other
lower
federal
courts
have
persisted
in
categorizing
for
the
purposes
of
trial
by
jury,
criminal
contempts
as
sui
generis.
in
other
words,
we
take
a
man
and
say
that
he
is
a
convict,
that
he
has
committed
a
criminal
offense,
that
the
criminal
statute
of
limitations
applies,
that
he's
going
to
jail,
that
he
loses
all
his
civil
rights
and
when
we
locked
him
up,
he
says,
“what
have
i
done?”
we
say
“you
haven't
committed
a
crime.
you've
committed
a
sui
generis.”
i
suggest
that
arose
by
any
other
name,
if
we
look
at
we're
doing
in
contempt
cases,
in
an
existential
way,
we're
saying
to
a
man,
“you've
done
something
wrong.
society
will
not
put
up
with
it.
we're
going
to
punish
you
for
it.
we're
going
to
put
the
machinery
of
our
government
into
play.
we're
going
to
take
you
out
of
society.
we're
going
to
deprive
you
of
your
rights.
we're
going
to
call
you
a
convict
and
put
you
in
prison”,
and
we
still
say
to
the
man,
“no,
you
haven't
committed
a
crime.
you
committed
only
a
sui
generis.”
in
defense
of
this
position,
the
government
states
in
its
brief
that
the
right
to
trial
--
to
no
trial
by
jury
or
the
fact
that
there
is
no
right
to
trial
by
jury
is
a
long
and
historical
one.
well,
that
isn't
really
a
complete
statement.
the
trend,
both
in
the
united
states
congress
and
the
united
states
courts,
has
consistently
been,
and
in
recent
days
has
become
--
this
has
become
more
so,
away
from
the
denial
of
the
right
to
trial
by
jury.
we
start
--
we
may
start
with
the
first
federal
legislation
on
the
subject
which
is
the
judiciary
act
of
1789.
it's
been
conceded
by
most
commentators
that
the
contempt
power
that
was
granted
by
that
statute
was
a
contempt
power
which
existed
in
common
law.
it
is
unknown
and
people
have
speculated
what
exactly
that
power
was,
what
the
outer
reaches
were.
i
suggest,
and
i
read
a
lot
of
contempt
cases
and
i
read
the
history
of
this,
that
there
is
no
absolute
clear
answer
to
this
question.
i
think
that
the
government
grasps
its
straws
when
it
suggest
in
its
brief
that
thomas
jefferson
had,
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
being
written,
a
15-volume
track
in
his
library
in
monticello.
and,
in
that
--
in
one
volume
of
that
15-volume
track,
on
one
page
is
the
statement
that
contempts
are
treated
summarily.
now,
if
my
history
is
correct,
i
believe,
thomas
jefferson
when
the
bill
of
rights
was
being
written
was
in
france.
but,
the
government
will
imply
that
one
page
in
that
15-volume
track
to
all
the
constitutional
framers.
i
suggest
that
this
game
can
be
played
on
both
sides.
there
was
a
1958
michigan
law
review
article
which
discussed
this
subject
and
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
prime
law
dictionaries
used
at
the
time
of
the
constitution's
framing
was
jacob's
law
dictionary.
and,
jacob's
law
dictionary
had
said
summary
contempts
violated
the
magna
carta's
right
to
trial
by
jury.
the
article
also
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
books
that
we
--
were
used
by
the
framers
often
was
gilbert's
history
and
practice
of
common
pleas,
which
said
the
same
thing.
but
i
can't
urge
to
this
court
that
because
one
or
two
books
said
yes
and
one
or
two
books
said
no,
that
this
was
what
the
people
had
in
their
minds
at
the
time
they
wrote
the
constitution.
moreover,
i
would
suggest
that
nobody
can.
moreover,
i
don't
think
it's
that
important
because
we
shouldn't
necessarily
be
bound
by
what
was
thought
proper
a
150
years
ago.
then
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
said
in
one
of
his
articles
on
this
subject
and
having
to
do
with
petty
offenses
and
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
the
harvard
law
review,
“at
least
let
us
not
import
into
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
discredited
practices
of
stuart
england.”
what
is
the
modern
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
he
said,
“at
least
let
us
not
import
into
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
the
discredited
practices
of
stuart
england.”
he
was
talking
about
the
summary
trial
for
contempt.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
considering
this
issue
again,
that
they
look
at
the
modern
treatment
of
the
problem
by
the
united
states
congress.
in
1914,
in
--
the
clayton
act
was
passed
and
it
guaranteed
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
for
contempts
arising
under
it.
and
in
every
piece
of
legislation
from
the
united
state
congress
from
1914
until
last
year's
--
1964
civil
rights
act,
congress
has
done
the
same
in
stronger
terms.
in
1932,
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
passed
and
it
guaranteed
the
right
to
trial
by
jury.
when
rule
42
was
promulgated,
it
too
preserved
the
right
to
trial
by
jury.
the
1957
civil
rights
act,
when
it
was
passed,
it
included
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
which
this
court's
dictum
in
the
barnett
case
might
well
have
followed
because
there,
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
is
only
guaranteed
where
the
sentence
is
over
45
days
or
$300.
in
the
landrum-griffin
act
of
1959,
which
setup
a
certain
kind
of
contempt,
it
was
provided
that
trials
by
jury
would
be
provided
for
those
criminal
contempts.
right
up
until
last
year,
1964
civil
rights
act,
when
this
was
debated
for
quite
a
long
time
on
the
floor
of
congress
and
it
was
decided
to
go
beyond
what
this
court
had
ruled
just
before
that
debate
began
as
to
the
right
to
trial
by
jury,
they
guarantee
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
for
all
criminal
contempts
arising
under
that
act.
indeed,
they
came
close
to
passing
a
law
that
would've
made
it
for
all
crimes.
congress
also,
it's
interesting,
passed
the
statute
in
1857
changing
its
summary
power
to
one
which
is
now
preceded
with
by
indictment,
trial
by
jury,
and
the
arguments
that
were
made
then
and
that
are
made
now,
and
which
i
suggest
are
boggy
arguments
that
it
would
collapse
if
the
legislative
process
couldn't
go
on,
have
failed.
i
think
everyone
agrees
that
we
now
have
one
of
the
most
dexterous
and
busy
and
effective
congresses
and
that
the
legislative
process
have
been
able
to
go
on.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
the
congress,
since
1857
--
well,
in
the
act,
mr.
justice
stewart,
they
did
not
deal
with
this.
however,
it
is
conceded
that
they
still
do
have
the
power,
and
my
study
of
the
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
--
congressional
contempt
power
is
that
they've
used
it
once.
i
would
suggest
too,
that
the
courts
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
well,
at
least
--
i
think,
with
respect
to
congress'
supervision
of
its
own
administrative
powers,
that
would
be
so.
but
i
think
the
court
is
better
equipped
to
deal
with
what
the
nature
of
the
judicial
power
is
--
than
perhaps
any
other
body.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
this
is
a
game
that
i
can't
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
--
i
can't
answer.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
i
could
only
say
that
every
time
that
congress
has
dealt
with
the
problem
in
modern
times
and
every
time
they
have
created
a
new
contempt,
they
have
specifically
guaranteed
the
right
to
trial
by
jury.
in
this
regard,
i
think
they
--
congress
and
this
court
is
paralleling
an
interest
in
avoiding
the
unusual
practices
of
summary
contempt
treatment.
this
court
--
the
supreme
court
said
in
anderson
v.
dunn,
all
the
way
back
1821,
that
the
least
possible
power
adequate
to
the
end
proposed
should
be
the
spirit
with
which
summary
contempt
power
is
exercised
because
as
another
court
said,
it
is
nearest
akin
to
despotic
power
of
any
power
existing
under
our
form
of
government.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
mr.
justice
stewart,
my
argument
is
in
the
alternative.
my
prime
argument
is
that
all
criminal
contempts
now,
today
are,
in
fact,
treated
as
crimes.
the
sentences
reflect
this.
as
such,
they
warrant
the
protections
of
the
constitution.
and,
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
--
rather
than
going
into
all
of
the
philosophical
analysis
and
reasons
why
i
would
stand
on
the
dissent,
mr.
justice
black
in
the
green
case,
which
more
eloquently
than
i
could
ever
sum
it
up,
stated
the
reasons
why
they
should
apply
across
the
board.
but
i
do
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
the
court
does
not
feel
or
if
the
majority
of
the
court
does
not
feel
that
it
could
go
this
far,
and
i
suggest
that
this
is
quite
a
different
court
from
the
green
case,
and
that
we
have
a
new
experience
since
the
green
case,
that
the
rules
suggested
in
the
barnett
case
is
a
very
wise
one.
i
think
it's
a
wise
one
for
this
reason.
aside
from
the
constitutional
issue,
what
are
the
basic
strong
feelings
that
have
been
expressed
on
both
sides
of
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
should
be
right
to
trial
by
jury?
those
who
feel
that
there
should
never
be
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
most
ordinarily
say
that
courts
must
have
some
power
to
deal
summarily
with
certain
kinds
of
obstructive
and
demoralizing
things
that
go
on
in
its
presence.
now,
without
this
power,
the
judicial
process
would
be
denigrated
if
courts
couldn't
function
and
it
would
be
time
consuming
and
wasteful.
on
the
other
side
of
the
argument,
those
who
argue
for
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
feel
--
and
they've
been
borne
out
by
experience
since
the
green
case
that
this
is
an
abusable
kind
of
power.
the
government
argues
that
we
need
a
summary
power
because
of
civil
rights
cases
in
the
south.
well,
the
same
summary
power
is
used
against
the
negroes
in
the
south
by
the
state
court
judges.
if
this
--
to
get
back
to
the
point,
the
argument
against
the
right
--
for
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
is
that
courts
shouldn't
be
able
to
avoid
the
constitutional
protections
if
they
are
going
to,
in
fact,
treat
a
man
as
a
criminal
and
put
him
in
jail
for
long
periods
of
time.
the
sentences
have
gone
as
high
as
four
years
in
recent
times
without
a
trial
by
jury
and
sometimes
without
even
a
hearing.
the
beauty,
it
seems
to
me,
of
the
footnote
in
the
barnett
case
is
that
it
balances.
it
preserves,
on
the
one
hand,
some
right
of
the
courts
to
deal
summarily
in
those
extreme
cases
and
yet,
on
the
other
hand,
it
guards
against
the
kind
of
thing
that
mr.
justice
clark
mentioned
in
the
barnett
case,
that
mr.
justice
black
has
consistently
mentioned,
that
mr.
chief
justice
warren
mentioned
in
the
brown
case,
that
has
concerned
everyone
who
has
considered
the
contempt
power
and
that
is,
that
the
sentences
are
just
getting
abusive,
the
courts
can't
keep
reviewing
it.
so,
i'm
arguing
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
to
get
back
--
i'm
arguing
alternatively.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
no
no,
the
presence
or
outside
the
presence
of
the
court
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
if
it's
a
criminal
contempt,
no
matter
where
it
takes
place,
it
would
be
treated
as
all
criminal
contempts.
however,
with
regard
to
sentence
--
i
would
concede
that
if
the
court
is
going
to
do
something
short
of
guaranteeing
the
rights
to
trial
by
jury
at
all
times,
that
something
akin
to
the
petty
offense
rule
would
apply,
would
be
a
reasonable
alternative
to
take.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
whether
the
six
--
whether
a
six-month
cutoff
or
a
four-month
cutoff
or
a
three-month
cutoff
is
the
right
point,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
scientific
answer
to
that.
i,
personally,
think
that
if
you're
talking
about
the
need
for
a
plenary
power
for
courts
to
protect
against
people,
profanity,
severe
physical
misconduct
in
its
presence,
that
even
six
months
goes
too
far.
that
you
could
have
--
and
i
suggest
this
in
my
book
that
you
could
have
a
--
that
all
governmental
bodies
could
have
some
kind
of
a
plenary
power
to
deal
with
misconduct
in
its
presence
which
could
be
quite
a
bit
short
of
putting
a
man
in
jail
for
one,
two,
three,
or
four
years.
now,
how
i
would
define
that
plenary
power
would
take
more
time
than
i
think
i
have
to
devote
to
this
case.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
the
petty
offense
rule
has
come
to
--
the
term
“petty
offense”
has
come
to
have
a
meaning
of
a
term
of
art.
if
you
pull
any
criminal
law
hornbook,
book
at
library
shelves,
they'll
talk
about
crimes
being
divided
into
different
categories,
treason,
felonies,
misdemeanors,
and
petty
offenses.
petty
offenses
are
crimes
which,
by
their
nature
and
by
their
treatment,
are
police
regulatory
kinds
of
matters
which
the
courts
--
because
of
the
volume
and
the
need
for
speed
in
certain
limited
cases
and
because
of
the
limitation
on
what
the
court
can
do
to
the
individuals,
have
been
limited
to,
at
the
most,
six
months.
the
first
section
of
title
18
of
our
criminal
code
or
federal
criminal
code
indicates
that
that
six-month
rule
apply
and,
in
the
different
treasons
that
i've
seen
six
months
have
been
applied.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
no,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
think
that
it
should
be
strictly
limited.
i
think
that
your
question
is
a
very
vital
one
because
it
is
important
for
this
court
to
deal
both
with
the
jury
trial
question
and
the
42
(a)
question
because
some
courts
have
distinguished
a
way.
the
barnett
footnote,
by
saying
this
is
a
42
(a)
case,
and
barnett
wasn't
in
the
presence
of
the
court
and
so
we
don't
have
to
follow
the
rule
in
the
presence
of
the
court.
that's
why
i
say
it's
very
important
that
if
--
that
the
right
to
trial
by
jury,
whether
it's
limited
by
six
months
or
not
apply
in
or
out
of
the
court's
presence.
i
do
think
that
there
could
be
--
could
conceivably
be
some
cases
where
rule
42
(a)
would
apply.
that
is,
if
this
court
should
not
find
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right
in
all
cases
--
all
criminal
contempt
cases
that
there's
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
but
only
cases
under
six
months,
then
conceivably,
some
misconduct
in
the
presence
of
the
court,
where
the
sentence
is
less
than
six
months,
42
(a)
could
apply
but
it
would
be
very
limited,
and
indeed,
this
42
(a),
when
it
was
passed,
was
considered
to
apply
to
only
a
rare
situation.
this
is
not
an
unusual
departure.
i
might
say
that
this
court
in
panico
against
the
united
states,
which
was
375
u.s.,
dealt
with
the
contempt
in
the
presence
of
the
court.
this
was
a
case
involving
someone
who
threw
ink
oil
at
the
judge
or1853
at
the
prosecutor.
the
most
disruptive
kind
of
contempt,
if
any
contempt
warranted
summary
punishment,
this
--
the
argument
would
be
strongest
here
and
yet,
this
court
sent
it
back
and
said
rule
42
(b)
at
least
is
necessary.
there's
got
to
be
a
hearing
to
see
if
there's
some
defense,
to
see
if
there's
some
extenuation,
to
see
if
there's
any
mitigation,
to
see
what
sentence
is
appropriate.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
in
the
harris
case?
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
the
frustrating
thing
about
the
harris
case,
your
honor,
is
caused
by
the
very
use
of
rule
42
(a).
we
don't
know
because
the
man
was
never
allowed
to
say.
we
can
certainly
assume
a
number
of
questions.
moreover,
there's
a
very
basic
rule
of
criminal
law
that
mr.
justice
holmes
mentioned
in
the
horning
case
in
254
u.s.,
and
there's
never
a
directed
verdict
in
a
criminal
case
even
if
there
are
no
issues
of
fact
and
no
issues
of
law.
in
justice
holmes'
words,
a
jury
may
decide
in
the
teeth
of
the
law
and
the
facts.
however,
there
were
some
very
serious
questions
suggested
even
in
the
very
brief
colloquy
in
the
harris
case.
for
example,
the
argument
about
the
applicability
of
the
communications
act,
the
argument
about
the
tariff
that
was
supposedly
violated,
the
question
whether
or
not
the
jury
was
in
fact
looking
into
another
crime
which
was
--
it
was
brought
out
in
one
of
the
colloquies
that
petitioner's
position
was
they
were
really
looking
into
a
violation
of
the
antiracketeering
statutes
but
they
were
making
it
look
like
it
was
the
communications
act
because
they
had
a
immunity
statute.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
yes.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
well,
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
there
was
much
more
that
this
court
could
have
looked
into
if
it
was
interested,
as
the
government
argues
it
was
interested
in
doing,
and
as
the
brown
rationale
argues,
less
interested
in
punishing
the
man
than
in
getting
his
testimony.
if
this
indeed
was
so,
then
the
court
would
not
have
been
so
precipitous.
i
think
that
it
compounds
the
wrong
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case
to
what
--
on
the
one
hand,
fog
him
off
from
making
any
statements
as
to
what
his
defenses
were
because
we
proceed
under
rule
42
(a).
and
when
i
appear
before
this
court
and
say
that
rule
42
(a)
is
unfair
because
he
didn't
have
any
--
he
wasn't
allowed
to
say
anything,
and
for
the
court
to
then
turn
it
back
at
me
and
say,
“well,
what
did
the
man
say?”
the
man
didn't
say
anything
because
he
wasn't
allowed
to
say
anything
and
i
don't
know
what
he
would
have
said
but,
conceivably,
there
are
defenses.
in
panico,
there
was
a
defense.
wouldn't
it
be
relevant
on
the
issue
of
sentence?
how
can
this
court
for
example,
mr.
justice
harlan
suggested
yesterday
that
the
court
--
this
court
and
the
other
federal
courts
have
the
power
to
reduce
the
sentence
is
it's
severe.
how
can
this
court
do
it
under
a
rule
42
(a)
proceeding
such
as
this
one
when
the
only
hearing
and
the
only
adjudication
of
sentence
is
this,
“we
open
this
court.
i
had
judged
you
guilty
of
contempt.
you're
sentenced
to
one
year.”
bang!
that's
it.
under
rule
42
(a),
how
can
a
court
like
this
review
a
sentence?
you
have
no
basis
to
know
whether
a
year
was
--
a
year
may
have
been
too
little.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
we
would
certainly
know.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
we
would
know
whatever
matters
of
defense,
mitigation,
or
extenuation
that
the
man
had.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
we
don't
know.
i
don't
know.
i
didn't
rep
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
i
didn't
represent
the
man
at
the
time.
i
don't
know
the
facts
given.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
infinite
ones
or
none,
but
at
the
maximum
--
at
the
minimum,
if
it
were
none,
he
would
nonetheless
be
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
in
fact,
it
was
the
only
question,
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
might
well
have
been
more.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
well,
i
would
suggest
whether
the
issue
of
relevancy
of
the
question
as
to
what
the
grand
jury
was
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
let
me
say
this.
one
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
no
no,
no,
no.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
yes.
i
might
also
add
the
crime
that
was
being
investigated
in
this
case.
the
maximum
sentence
would
have
been
one
year
after
trial
by
jury.
since
the
green
case,
if
i
may
proceed,
the
dower
predictions
of
those
who
dissented
on
this
court
have
been
borne
out.
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
in
his
majority
opinion
in
the
green
case
that
until
1914,
there
were
no
summary
contempt
sentences
for
criminal
contempts
over
a
year.
but
from
1914
until
the
green
case
in
1957,
there
were
nine
such
sentences.
since
then,
and
at
the
time
of
the
brown
case
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
with
this
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
with
the
sentence?
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
yes.
that's
the
way
i
read
mr.
justice
harlan's
statement.
but
since
that
time,
sentences
have
soared
and
have
been
typical.
indeed,
the
instant
case
is
just
one
arising
out
of
an
investigation
in
the
southern
district
and
i
understand
that
there
are
four
or
five
petitions
for
cert
pending
in
this
court
now
in
which
the
sentences
were
one
year
and
two
years.
i
might
also
add
that
in
some
of
those
cases,
rule
42
(b)
was
proceeded
--
was
used
as
the
procedure,
and
apparently,
leaving
the
second
circuit
--
the
rights
of
individuals
in
the
second
circuit
to
depend
on
which
judge
or
which
prosecutor
he's
dealing
with.
but
in
any
event,
with
regard
to
the
right
to
trial
by
jury,
it
is
not
at
all
as
clear
as
the
government's
brief
urges
that
we
have
traditionally
just
simply
denied
it.
in
the
1965
american
bar
association
journal,
the
then
president
of
the
aba,
mr.
louis
powell,
speaking
at
an
aba
group
surely
no
radical
organization
said,
“the
contempt
power
has
been
regarded
always
with
uneasy
distrust
by
americans.
it
is
at
best,
a
tolerated
anomaly
to
the
fundamental
principle
of
trial
by
jury.”
i
suggest
that
he's
right
and
that
if
the
court
should,
through
it
--
under
its
supervisory
powers
or
under
its
constitutional
interpretation
of
the
--
of
article
3
in
the
sixth
amendment,
decide
that
there
should
be
right
to
trial
by
jury,
it
would
not
at
all
be
such
a
radical
departure
from
what
has
been
going
on
in
the
congress
and
in
the
courts
and
in
the
thoughtful
discussions
of
this
subject
through
the
years.
one
point
that
mr.
justice
harlan
raised
yesterday
and
which
came
up
again
in
my
conversation
with
mr.
justice
stewart
is
whether
or
not
the
power
of
the
appellate
courts
to
reduce
sentences
is
really
a
sufficient
enough
guarantee.
i
suggested
yesterday,
in
answer
to
that
question,
that
constitutional
rights
aren't
matters
of
grace.
you
either
have
them
or
you
don't.
but,
i
thought
about
it
further
last
night
and
feel
that
it
warrants
even
a
fuller
answer.
first
of
all,
the
administrator
of
courts
has
pointed
out
in
a
speech
last
week
and
that
i've
read
a
report
in
the
newspapers
that
the
appellate
case
load
is
burgeoning
and
that
if
--
if
anything,
we
don't
need
more
kinds
of
policing
jobs
in
the
supreme
court.
secondly,
i
would
point
out
that
this
kind
of
argument
is
really
a
parallel
to
the
argument.
i
believe
that
was
raised
when
this
court
considered
betts
and
brady
in
the
gideon
case.
of
course,
there
are
other
issues
involved
there,
but
in
--
really,
in
gideon,
didn't
you
say
that
it's
not
enough
to
reverse
convictions
where
the
right
of
counsel
is
taken
away
only
where
a
man
is
deprived
of
his
rights
or
hurt,
that
the
case-by-case
approach
isn't
sufficient?
well,
i
think
--
this
is
how
i
interpret
it,
that
if
the
man
is
entitled
to
his
right
to
counsel,
he
was
entitled
to
it.
i
suggest
that,
as
the
gideon
case
eliminated
the
case
by
case
ad
hoc
approach
for
right
to
counsel
cases,
that
the
barnett
case
did
the
same
with
regard
to
sentences
which
are
severe.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
your
honor,
the
footnote
in
the
barnett
case,
i
think,
is
vitally
important.
i
think
it's
more
than
dictum,
as
the
government
suggested
in
its
brief.
mr.
justice
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
it
was,
and
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
third
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
have
already
adopted
this
rule
without
any
complaint
in
randazzo
against
the
united
states
in
the
fifth
circuit,
in
rollason
against
the
united
states
in
an
opinion
by
judge
bazelon
i
believe,
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
and
in
the
third
circuit
as
well.
we
don't
know
how
many
district
courts
have
conformed
to
it
already
because
if
they
have,
we
wouldn't
have
any
objections.
the
only
circuit
that
we
know
who
has
--
which
has
not
followed
it
is
the
second
circuit,
but
ha
--
almost
half
of
the
circuits
have
already
adopted
this
rule.
moreover,
mr.
justice
clark
went
out
of
his
way
to
say
that,
in
view
of
barnett's
impending
case,
the
effective
administration
of
justice
requires
that
this
dictum
be
added.
now,
this
wasn't
just
surpluses
or
a
side-remark
that
one
picks
up
in
the
course
of
the
case.
it
was
intended
to
reach
the
eyes
and
considerations
of
people,
and
it
has.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
it
is.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
declaration
of
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
i
understand.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
i
think
that
those
members
of
the
court
that
feel
that
would
reflect
the
wisest
and
most
sensitive
thought
on
the
subject,
since
it's
been
considered
in
this
court.
i
would
like
to
conclude
by
saying
that
this
case
really
gets
down
to
a
very
basic
issue
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
the
introduction
to
the
jury
trial
guarantees
a
man
his
rights
under
the
constitution
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
--
all
rights
which
apply
to
him
before
he
would
be
treated
as
a
criminal.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
if
in
fact,
we're
treating
contemnors
as
criminals.
i
don't
bewail
the
fact
that
people
go
to
jail,
your
honor,
that
people
are
punished
for
misconduct
in
courts.
i
think
it's
proper
that
they
should.
it's
just
a
question
of
the
way
we
deal
with
people.
we're
dealing
with
contemnors
as
criminals.
we're
giving
them
most
of
the
rights
of
criminals
and
all
of
the
bad
aspects
of
being
a
criminal,
but
we're
depriving
them
of
their
rights
to
trial
by
jury.
if
we're
going
to
do
that,
he's
entitled
to
his
rights
and
the
man
is
being
given
his
constitutional
rights
is
enough
in
and
of
itself
to
be
a
valuable
end.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
with
regard
to
the
summary
disposition
of
criminal
contempts,
i
think
that
the
recent
scholarship
on
the
subject
bares
that
out,
that
the
decisions
in
the
past
which
have
upheld
it
were
based
on
erroneous
interpretations
of
history
which
have
been
gone
into
at
great
length.
and
i
might
say,
that
you,
yourself,
sir
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
your
honor
said
in
the
green
case
that
this
court
doesn't
write
on
a
blank
sheet.
i
would
suggest
now
that
this
court
has
on
its
sheet
the
barnett
case
and
that
at
--
at
a
minimum,
this
court
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
no
no,
i
was
referring
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
yes
sir.
i
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
your
honor,
i
also
read
the
government's
appendix
and
i
hope
that
mr.
spritzer
when
he
gets
up
to
argue,
will
explain
what
it
all
means
because
the
only
way
--
the
only
weight
that
i
concede
to
it
was
impounded.
it
had
nothing
to
clarify
what
the
law
was
or
what
the
law
is
or
what
the
law
ought
to
be.
it
merely
was
a
listing
of
how
certain
cases
were
treated
in
the
past.
i
accept
it
as
so,
but
not
dispositive.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
if
what?
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
if
i
haven't
made
it
--
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
if
i
haven't
made
it
clear
that
the
petitioner
would
like
that,
then
let
me
say
that
that
is
exactly
what
we
think
and
i
also
would
like
to
say,
in
conclusion
that,
with
regard
to
the
questions
of
rule
42
(a)
and
with
regard
to
the
question
of
a
trial
by
jury,
we
get
down
in
this
case
to
a
very
basic
question
and
that
is,
“should
american
law,
in
the
mid-twentieth
century,
condone
sending
a
man
to
jail
for
a
year
or
more
without
a
trial
by
jury,
without
even
a
hearing?”
and
i
suggest
that
--
i
would
hate
to
think
that
this
court
would
say
yes.
i
have
talked
about
the
need
for
a
modern
and
a
progressive
rule.let
me
conclude
my
remarks
to
you
by
going
back
a
bit.
the
first
case
in
the
united
states
involving
summary
contempt
for
publication
out
of
the
court
invol
--
was
a
case
entitled
respublica
against
oswald.
it
involved
a
man
who
wrote
an
issue
called
the
independent
gazetteer
in
pennsylvania
and
he
wrote
at
the
time
about
whether
or
not
pennsylvania
should
adopt
and
ratify
the
federal
constitution.
for
some
reason,
he
was
found
guilty
of
contempt
and
summarily
punished.
he
took
his
case
to
the
courts
and
was
turned
down
on
the
very
precedence
we've
discussed
today.
then,
he
took
his
case
to
the
pennsylvania
legislature
where
he
was
represented
by
a
lawyer
named
william
finley.
finley
said
then,
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
say
that
the
rights
of
americans,
that
american
freemen
should
be
no
greater
than
those
of
the
subject
of
king
george.
he
said
that
the
right
to
is
--
that
allowing
summary
punishments
of
contempt
would
do
just
that
and
he
said,
“such
a
ruling
would
involve
the
sophistry
of
the
schools
and
the
jargon
of
the
law
to
pervert
and
corrupt
the
explicit
language
of
the
constitution.”
that
was
1788.
we've
come
almost
200
years
from
that
time
and
i
can
do
no
better
in
urging
the
court
today
than
to
reiterate
the
words
of
mr.
finley
in
the
hope
that,
although
they
did
no
good
in
the
first
case
of
summary
contempt
in
this
country,
that
they
may
do
some
good
in
making
this
the
last.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
--
did.
in
this
case,
the
antecedent
conduct
was,
that
one
week
before,
he
was
asked
the
same
questions
before
the
same
judge,
the
same
grand
jury,
and
he
was
upheld
when
he
took
the
fifth
amendment
in
his
contention.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
a
jury
trial
has
to
be
waived.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
requested.
so
far
as
i
understand,
there
was
a
request
specifically
for
a
hearing
and
an
opportunity
to
put
in
witnesses.
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
in
haec
verba,
in
those
words?
mr.
ronald
l.
goldfarb
yes.
as
i
say,
he
asked
for
a
hearing,
for
the
chance
to
present
his
side
of
the
case,
for
it
to
be
open,
he
asked
for
all
of
the
ingredients
of
what
is
either
a
full
hearing
or
a
right
to
trial
by
jury.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
solicitor
--
in
response
to
the
solicitor's
c
--
suggestion
that
the
counsel
didn't
complain
about
the
closeness
of
the
proceeding,
if
the
court
will
just
look
at
this,
and
it's
a
very
short
record
on
page
32
and
33,
half
of
the
whole
adjudication
and
sentencing
is
the
counsel
asking
for
an
open
proceeding.
he
was
turned
down.
the
court
says
it's
open
and
he
protested
and
said
“but
this
is
sealed.”
then,
finally,
the
court
made
its
adjudication.
i
suggest
if
he
had
gone
any
further
with
this
judge,
he
might
have
been
held
in
contempt
himself.
thirdly,
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
--
former
mr.
justice
goldberg's
dissent
in
the
barnett
case,
i
would
say
that
even
if
this
court
finds
that
the
history
was
not
good,
certainly,
it
was
very
wise
arbitration
and
the
presentation
of
a
very
just
solution
to
an
impasse
that
this
court
has
had
to
face
for
so
many
years.
it's
a
very
balanced
and
reasonable
and
wise
compromise
to
the
two
extreme
views
that
have
been
prevailing
through
the
years.
fourth,
i
would
say
that
more
so
in
contempt
than
in
the
case
of
any
other
crime
could
it
be
argued
that
there
is
truly
a
need
for
a
trial
by
jury,
the
insulating
aspect
of
a
jury,
more
so
in
the
case
where
the
person
who
is
the
offended
party
and
the
victim
is
also
the
adjudicator.
more
so,
even
in
any
other
crime
it
could
be
argued
is
there
a
need
for
a
trial
by
jury?
finally,
with
regard
to
the
question
of
the
severity
of
the
sentence
which
this
court
--
a
number
of
the
members
of
the
court
raised
or
just
point
out
that,
in
the
1964
statistics
for
crimes
in
the
united
states
which
i
just
checked
with
the
statistician
for
the
administrative
of
the
federal
courts,
of
all
the
felony
convictions
in
the
united
states
last
year
where
there
were
sentences,
one
--
only
39%
of
those
convictions
did
then
received
a
sentence
of
a
year
or
more
so
that
this
man,
without
a
hearing,
without
a
trial
by
jury,
was
up
there
with
the
worst
convicted
convicts
of
this
country
in
terms
of
the
severity
of
his
sentence,
that
there
can
be
any
doubt
that
a
year
is
severe.
thank
you.
