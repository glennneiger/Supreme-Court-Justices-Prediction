justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
the
judge
that
he
reconsider
the
sentence
if
he
went
in
appraised
himself?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
both
you
and
the
government
are
arguing
on
that
premise
aren't
you,
this
is
criminal
contempt.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
jury
should
be
given
the
power
to
take
the
sentence,
are
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
under
your
view,
if
he
had
a
jury
trial,
whatever
issues
there
were,
the
judge
would've
been
free,
subject
to
the
powers
of
a
review
of
this
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
to
impose
a
year
of
sentence
or
a
five-year
sentence.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
be
an
awful
lot
out
of
that
footnote
it
seems
to
me
are
trying
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
mr.
goldfarb,
as
i
get
the
basic
premise
of
your
argument,
it's
the
uneasiness
that
you
have
that
the
contempt
power
existing
now,
as
it
has
been
for
all
our
judicial
history,
is
likely
to
be
abused.
now,
how
does
the
abuse,
which
i
take
it,
means
that
you're
afraid
that
long
and
proper
sentences
are
going
to
be
imposed
which
won't
be
adequately
reviewed
by
appellate
courts,
how
is
--
or
any
of
those
fears
met
by
the
introduction
of
a
jury
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
doesn't
affect
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
argument
simply
is
that
the
accepted
constitutional
practice,
since
the
history
of
this
country,
has
been
wrong.
it
should
be
declared.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
argument
was
made
in
the
green
case
and
rejected?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
barnett
footnote?
justice
john
m.
harlan
