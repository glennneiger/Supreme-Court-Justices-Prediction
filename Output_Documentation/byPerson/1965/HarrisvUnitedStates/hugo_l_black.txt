justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
spritzer,
is
it
quite
correct
to
say
that
the
purpose
of
a
hearing
in
a
criminal
case,
i
understand
the
argument
of
whether
this
is
a
criminal
case,
the
purpose
of
hearing
a
criminal
case
emitting
all
of
the
facts,
isn't
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
not
to
give
a
man
the
protection
of
a
criminal
--
of
a
jury
and
in
certain
kinds
of
case,
a
grand
jury
indictment,
the
decision
of
facts
by
the
jurors
instead
of
the
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
this
was
a
criminal
case,
would
it
be
correct
to
say
that
the
only
purpose
of
the
hearing
is
to
have
the
facts
recited
by
the
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
merely
speaking
out
to
one
statement,
the
purpose
of
a
hearing
is
merely
to
have
the
facts
presented.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
in
a
particular
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
thats
right,
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
with
reference
to
the
penalty,
what
was
the
maximum
penalty
that
you
found
had
been
imposed
in
colonial
days
for
contempt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
intend
to
bother
you,
but
you
had
just
conferred
to
the
fact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
far
as
what
was
done,
not
what's
done
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you'll
tell
us
when
it
comes
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
provide
how
the
trial
should
be
held?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
--
is
there
any
of
these
statutes
that
you
referred
say
that
the
judge
can
try
him
without
a
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
little
difficult
to
view
that
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
offenses
punishable
have
always
been
tried
by
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it'd
be
a
little
difficult
to
go
on
terminology,
wouldn't
it?
if
you
want
to
get
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
using
these
statutes,
as
i
understand
it,
to
show
that
they
would
not
have
been
indicted
at
a
trial
by
jury
for
violation
of
those
statutes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
show
that
--
do
you
show
why
they
were
not
tried
by
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
waived
the
jury
trial.
the
statute
said
nothing
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
want
to
bring
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
there
couldn't
have
been
much
doubt
that
if
a
man
was
tried
and
they
call
the
defense
contempt
and
could
banish
him
for
the
country
for
it,
that
he'd
probably
would
have
been
entitled
trial
by
jury,
wouldn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
any
civilized
--
for
you
to
commonly
express
it,
in
any
civilized
society.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
this
particular
man
had
been
tried
under
statute
passed
by
congress
which
compelled
him
to
answer
the
question,
would
he
have
been
entitled
to
trial
by
jury,
statute
passed
by
congress
rather
than
order
of
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
i
--
what
i
mean
is,
if
there
are
many
times
that
people
are
tried
for
contempt
and
all
times,
as
i
understand
it,
but
it's
not
under
a
statute
passed
by
congress.
the
statute
passed
by
congress
had
required
that
he
answer
questions
or
else
suffer
punishment
over
here,
would
he
have
been
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
do
have
many
--
i
started
to
ask
you
a
question
because
i'm
a
little
bothered
by
your
statement
of
the
attorney
general
being
bothered
but
not
having
power
always
to
try
people
for
violation
of
injunction
without
a
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
is
a
violation
of
a
law
made
by
the
judge.
one
is
a
violation
of
the
law
made
by
the
congress.
and,
you
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
attorney
general
who
argued
is
bothered
because
they
want
to
create
more
crimes
by
injunction
so
that
they
can
avoid
having
a
trial
by
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
take,
for
instance
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
an
order
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
take,
for
instance,
an
order
under
the
old
prohibition
law
violating
not
to
vi
--
ordering
not
to
violate
the
prohibition
law
at
the
moment.
would
you
think
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
jury
there?
is
that
what's
desired,
that
the
judges
can
issue
orders
to
obey
laws
that
congress
has
passed
and
then
try
them
without
a
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
frequently,
the
judge
has
allowed
to
issue
injunctions
to
prevent
its
violation,
and
then
the
only
difference
would
be
in
our
systems
of
law
and
whether
legislature
alone
made
it
--
said
no
to
it,
you've
got
a
trial
by
jury.
but
where
the
judge
adds
his
statement
to
it,
you've
got
a
trial
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
injunction.
so,
he
advice
--
order
them
not
to
violate
a
law
that
congress
has
passed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
each
---
each
order,
legislative
order
that
you
don't
violate
the
narcotics
law,
you
don't
violate
the
prohibition
law,
each
one
of
them
is
an
order
that
you
don't
do
it
and
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all
i
want
to
get,
that
is,
i
hope
i
do.
the
statement
that
you
were
not
meaning,
the
ones
you
said
about
the
attorney
general
were
that
this
would
become
a
government
by
injunction
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
order
to
prevent
trial
by
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
each
instance,
what
is
involved
is
whether
it's
an
injunction
by
the
court
or
by
passage
of
a
law
by
congress
forbidding
something
to
be
done
in
each
instance.
in
each
instance,
it's
an
act
of
the
government
which
says
“we
forbid
you
to
do
this.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
basic
premise
for
drawing
a
line,
taking
away
a
man's
right
that
he
ordinarily
has
under
the
bill
of
rights
simply
because
the
court
adds
its
sanction
for
that
which
congress
has
imposed?
