mr.
john
j.
abt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
brings
to
the
court
for
review
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
affirming
two
orders
of
the
subversive
activities
control
board,
each
order
is
addressed
to
one
of
the
petitioners
and
requires
him
to
register
with
the
attorney
general
under
sections
8
(a)
and
(c)
of
the
subversive
activities
control
act
and
i
quote,
“as
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
of
america,
a
communist-action
organization.”
the
court
has
so
--
the
board
rather
has
so
far
issued
similar
orders
against
40
other
--
41
other
persons
which
it
has
been
stipulated
are
to
abide
the
result
in
this
case.
the
case
is
one
of
the
sequels
to
the
court's
1961
decision
in
communist
party
versus
subversive
activities
control
board.
there,
as
you
will
recall,
the
court
affirmed
the
board's
1953
finding
that
the
communist
party
is
a
communist-action
organization
and
the
order
that
it
register
as
such
under
section
7
of
the
act.
the
court
held,
however,
that
it
was
premature
to
decide
whether
enforcement
of
this
order
was
constitutionally
permissible.
under
the
act's
definitions,
a
communist-action
organization
is
a
domestic
agent
of
the
world
communist
movement
which
section
2
describes
as
a
worldwide
seditious
conspiracy
under
the
domination
and
control
of
the
soviet
union.
section
8
(a)
of
the
act
provides
upon
the
failure
of
an
organization
to
register
as
a
communist-action
organization
in
obedience
to
a
final
registration
order
and
to
furnish
the
attorney
general
with
a
list
of
its
members.
it
becomes
the
duty
of
each
member
to
register
himself.
failure
to
register
is
not
punishable
at
this
point.
however,
section
13
provides
for
board
proceedings
on
petition
of
the
attorney
general
for
a
finding
that
an
accused
individual
is
a
member
of
a
communist-action
organization
and
for
an
order
that
he
register
as
such.
one
such
a
board
order
becomes
final,
failure
to
register
is
punishable
by
imprisonment
for
five
years
and
a
fine
of
$10,000
both
penalties
cumulative
for
each
day
that
the
failure
to
register
continues.
mr.
john
j.
abt
oh
yes,
justice
harlan.
mr.
john
j.
abt
there
was
in
this
case
and
i'll
come
to
a
description
of
that
here
momentarily.
section
8
(c)
provides
that
the
registration
of
an
individual
shall
be
accompanied
by
a
registration
statement
containing
such
information
as
the
attorney
general
may
by
regulation
prescribe.
failure
to
file
a
statement
is
punishable
by
a
--
by
imprisonment
for
five
years
and
a
$10,000
fine
but
noncumulative.
under
regulations
of
the
attorney
general,
registration
under
section
8
(a)
is
accomplished
by
filing
a
form,
is-52a
which
appears
at
page
65
of
our
brief,
signed
by
the
registrant
and
stating,
and
again
i
quote,
“that
he
hereby
registers
as
a
member
of
blank,”
naming
the
organization,
“a
communist-action
organization”.
the
registration
statement
under
8
(c)
consists
of
a
separate
form,
form
is-52,
which
is
reproduced
at
page
66
of
our
brief
which
calls
for
the
registrant's
name
and
address,
his
aliases,
the
date
and
place
of
his
birth,
the
name
of
the
communist-action
organization
of
which
he
is
a
member,
and
the
offices
and
the
organization
held
by
him
during
the
preceding
year.
now,
the
communist
party
did
not
register
subsequent
to
this
court's
decision
of
1961,
instead,
it
has
resisted
enforcement
of
the
board's
order
that
it
do
so
in
criminal
proceedings
in
which
it
has
reasserted
all
the
constitutional
objections
to
enforcement
which
this
court
held
premature
in
the
'61
decision.
its
conviction
in
1962
for
failure
to
register
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
grounds
that
the
government
had
not
met
its
burden
of
proving
the
existence
of
some
person
who
is
willing
to
incriminate
himself
by
signing
and
submitting
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
required
registration
documents
on
behalf
of
the
organization.
after
the
denial
of
certiorari,
the
government
moved
for
a
retrial
of
this
criminal
case
which
is
now
scheduled
to
begin
in
the
district
court
on
november
first.
mr.
john
j.
abt
there
was
also
a
new
indictment
and
the
government
is
retrying
the
old
indictment
pursuant
to
the
option
that
the
court
of
appeals
gave
and
the
government
secured
a
new
indictment
charging
a
subsequent
failure
to
register
on
the
part
of
the
organization.
the
district
court
consolidated
the
two
indictments
and
the
consolidated
case
is
going
to
trial,
as
i
say,
in
november.
meantime,
in
1962,
the
attorney
general
instituted
the
present
proceedings
before
the
board,
alleging
that
the
communist
party
had
not
complied
with
the
order
that
it
register,
petitioners
who
are
members
of
the
party
and
that
they
had
not
registered.
in
their
answers
to
the
attorney
general's
petition,
petitioners
claim
their
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
being
required
to
register
and
file
a
registration
statement.
and
on
the
same
ground,
decline
to
answer
the
allegations
of
the
petition
with
respect
to
their
membership
in
the
communist
party.
they
also
in
their
answers
denied
the
allegation
of
the
petition
that
the
party
is
a
communist-action
organization.
the
attorney
general's
evidence
consisted
of
the
testimony
of
informer
witnesses
that
the
petitioners
had
attended
party
meetings
and
had
been
elected
to
party
officers.
petitioners
offered
no
evidence.
in
a
report
accompanying
its
order
in
the
case
of
petitioner
albertson,
the
board
held
that
petitioners
were
bound
by
and
could
not
relitigate
the
1953
determination
that
the
communist
party
is
a
communist-action
organization.
the
act
neither
requires
nor
was
there
any
evidence
or
finding
in
the
board
proceedings
that
petitioners
had
engaged
in
any
unlawful
conduct
or
advocacy,
had
knowledge
of
such
conduct
or
advocacy
on
the
part
of
the
communist
party
or
knew
believed
that
it
had
the
characteristics
ascribed
by
the
act
to
communist-action
organizations.
petitioner's
challenge
of
the
act
and
the
orders
is
confined
to
constitutional
grounds.
we
raise
no
evidentiary
and
no
procedural
issues.
the
court
below
held
that
adjudication
of
the
privilege
issue
which
is
in
this
case
is
premature
and
could
be
raised
only
in
a
criminal
prosecution
of
the
petitioners
for
failure
to
register.
and
that
the
remaining
issues
are
either
likewise
premature
or
are
foreclosed
by
year
1961
decision
in
the
party
case.
now,
before
coming
to
petitioner's
specific
constitutional
objections,
i
want
first
for
a
moment
to
examine
the
function
or
purpose
of
the
member
registration
requirement
of
the
act.
the
purpose
of
registration
under
the
act
as
stated
in
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
was
and
i
quote,
“to
effect
disclosure
of
the
identity
and
propaganda
of
individual
communists
and
communist
organizations.”
similarly,
the
court
in
the
party
case
found
constitutional
justification
for
requiring
the
party
to
register
and
disclose
the
names
of
its
members
in
the
need
to
strip
what
it
called
the
mask
of
anonymity
from
an
organization
that
congress
had
declared
to
be
a
foreign
control
seditious
conspiracy.
now,
mr.
forer
and
i,
i'm
sure
the
court
knows,
disagree
with
the
decision
in
the
party
case
for
reasons
that
are
eloquently
stated
in
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
black.
but
it
is
unnecessary
to
rephrase
that
ground
here.
for
the
requirement
of
self-registration
by
members
as
distinguished
from
the
requirement
of
organizational
registration
has
no
conceivable
justification
as
a
disclosure
measure.
this
is
so
because
a
person
is
not
required
to
register
as
a
member
until
after
the
board
has
made
the
disclosure
that
he
is
a
member
by
finding
him
to
be
a
member.
self-registration
as
a
member
after
the
board
has
found
him
to
be
one
is
therefore
completely
superfluous
to
any
conceivable
disclosure
objective.
and
the
government's
fruitless
effort
to
unearth
any
other
legitimate
function
for
this
self
--
compulsory
self-registration
requirement
confirms
a
fact
that
indeed
it
hasn't.
the
government
says
that
the
major,
embodied
at
one
point
calls
the
sole
function
of
compulsory
registration
as
a
member
is
to
enable
the
attorney
general
to
compile
a
centralized
public
roster
of
registrants.
but
as
it
appears
from
section
9
(a)
of
the
act,
congress
made
no
provision
for
such
a
roster
of
individual
members
provided
for
such
a
roster
of
organi
--
registered
organizations
but
not
of
members.
and
obviously,
had
it
desired
such
a
roster,
it
could
have
directed
the
attorney
general
to
compile
one
from
the
orders
of
the
board
rather
than
to
require
self-registration.
besides,
it
would
be
preposterous
to
suppose
that
congress
prescribed
cumulative
penalties
amounting
to
life
imprison
--
imprisonment
merely
to
--
for
a
refusal
to
cooperate
with
the
attorney
general
in
this
minor
clerical
duty.
the
fact
is
that
the
object
of
self-registration
is
not
to
get
disclosure
but
to
get
communists.
the
means
used
in
the
act
is
to
confront
them
with
the
alternatives
of
self-incrimination,
self-defamation,
and
the
sacrifice
of
privacy,
conscience,
and
belief
by
registering
or
life
imprisonment
for
non-registration.
the
act
admits
of
no
other
rational
interpretation
and
neither
the
government
nor
the
court
below
could
offer
one.
it
is
against
this
background
that
i
turn
to
petitioner's
specific
constitutional
objections.
our
first
objection
is
that
the
requirement
of
self-registration
requires
petitioners
to
incriminate
themselves.
they
claim
their
privilege
as
i
indicated
in
their
answers
to
the
attorney
general's
petitions
and
began
in
their
petitions
for
review
of
the
registration
orders
by
the
court
below.
these
claims
were
denied
by
the
attorney
general
in
continuing
to
prosecute
the
proceedings
by
the
board
in
issuing
the
registration
orders
and
by
both
in
descending
those
orders
in
these
review
proceedings.
under
these
circumstances
as
the
government
now
acknowledge,
the
court
below
was
clearly
in
no
error
in
holding
that
adjudication
of
the
privilege
issue
is
premature.
the
government
now
concedes
that
petitioner's
claims
are
right
for
adjudication
insofar
as
they
are
addressed
to
any
form
of
registration
and
any
form
of
registration
statement
that
would
meet
the
requirements
of
section
8
(a)
and
(c)
and
the
board's
orders.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
justice
fortas.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
my
under
--
no,
they
say
the
same
--
they
say
in
words
--
say
the
same
thing
about
the
act
of
registration.
but
as
i'll
try
to
show,
justice
fortas,
neither
of
their
reservations,
their
reservations
that
i'm
coming
to
as
they
make
it
are
of
no
consequence
as
applied
either
to
the
act
of
registration
or
to
the
registration
statement.
if
you
could
give
me
just
a
moment,
i
think
i'll
make
that
clear.
what
they
urge
is
that
the
issue
was
premature
insofar
as
petitioner's
claims
of
privilege
are
addressed
to
particular
items
of
both
forms,
the
form
of
registration
and
the
form
of
registration
statement
which
are
not
required
by
the
terms
of
the
act
and
the
board's
orders.
now,
as
it
will
appear
in
just
a
moment,
there
are
no
such
items
in
form
is-52a
that
is
the
registration
form,
except
for
the
bare
detail
of
the
registrant's
address.
and
for
reasons
that
i'll
discuss
later,
the
government's
reservation
is
likewise
of
no
consequence
with
respect
to
form
is-52
the
registration
statement.
but
i'd
like
first
to
turn
to
the
merits
of
petitioner's
claims
of
privilege
with
respect
to
the
bare
requirement
of
registration
under
section
8
(a).
section
8
(a)
and
section
13
(g)
of
the
act,
the
orders
of
the
board
and
form
is-52a,
all
specifically
require
each
petitioner
to
register
and
i
quote,
“as
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
of
america”,
and
thereby
to
admit
membership
in
that
organization.
such
an
admission
as
this
court
has
frequently
held
is
incriminating
and
may
not
be
compelled.
moreover,
sections
8
(a)
and
13
(g)
seem
to
require
a
registrant
not
only
to
admit
membership
in
the
organization
but
to
describe
it
as
and
thus
to
admit
that
it
is
a
communist-action
organization.
the
government
has
so
interpreted
these
two
sections
for
the
board's
orders
and
the
attorney
general's
form,
all
require
petitioners
to
register
not
only
as
members
of
the
communist
party
but
as
members
of
the
communist
party,
a
communist-action
organization.
this
admission
at
the
communist
party
has
a
criminal
and
conspiratorial
character
which
the
act
attributes
to
communist-action
organizations
is
of
course
also
incriminating.
and
if
you'll
look
at,
mr.
justice
fortas,
at
the
registration
form
is-52a,
you'll
observe
that
it
requires
nothing
but
these
two
admissions,
an
admission
of
membership
and
admission
that
the
organization
is
a
communist-action
organization
other
than
appending
the
address
of
the
registrant
below
as
signatured.
mr.
john
j.
abt
right,
right.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
yes.
and
i'll
--
i'll
come
to
that
again
if
you'll
permit
me.
let
me
just
anticipate
my
argument.
our
position
is
that
the
registration
statement
is
dependent
on
and
merely
auxiliary
to
--
ancillary
to
the
act
of
registration
because
the
act
says
that
the
registration
statement
shall
accompany
the
registration.
if
there's
no
registration,
then
there's
no
requirement
of
registration
statement.
plus
the
fact
that
the
act
imposes
cumulative
penalties
for
the
bare
--
for
failure
to
--
to
perform
the
bare
act
of
registration
but
only
a
single
penalty
for
failing
to
file
a
registration
statement
which
we
say
also
shows
that
the
principal
duty
here,
the
primary
duty
is
the
duty
to
register,
to
file,
to
comply
with
--
with
what
is
included
in
form
is-52a.
mr.
john
j.
abt
severable,
that's
correct.
that's
severable
in
the
sense
that
there
is
no
obligation
to
file
a
statement
unless
the
registrant
performs
the
act
of
registering.
mr.
john
j.
abt
right.
mr.
john
j.
abt
right.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
abt
there
are
two
separate
requirements
in
the
act,
one
in
8
(a)
and
one
in
8
(c).
and
each
carries
its
own
penalties.
the
failure
to
file
is-52a
carries
a
daily
--
daily
cumulative
penalty.
the
failure
to
file
is-52
under
section
8
(c)
of
the
statement
carries
with
it
only
a
single
penalty.
there
are
two
separate
--
separate
requirements,
each
separately
punishable.
and
we
say,
and
it
seems
clear
from
the
act,
that
there
is
no
obligation
to
file
a
statement
unless
the
individual
registers.
mr.
john
j.
abt
and
that's
not
to
say
that
congress
was
giving
a
man
a
bonus
for
--for
failing
to
register.
it's
just
the
sensible
thing
that
a
man
was
already
accumulating
a
life
--
a
life
sentence
for
non-registration
and
there's
no
point
in
imposing
another
additional
penalty
upon
him
for
failing
to
file
a
registration
statement.
mr.
john
j.
abt
right,
right.
mr.
john
j.
abt
he
satisfied
8
(a),
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
j.
abt
these
cumulative
penalties.
mr.
john
j.
abt
right.
he'd
be
stopped
for
a
one
shot
offense
of
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
well
the
government
--
it's
hard
to
tell.
the
government
didn't
quite
--
didn't
meet
our
argument
although
we
made
it
in
our
brief.
although
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
there
are
a
number
of
statements
in
the
government's
brief
which
would
seem
to
indicate
that
they
probably
agree
with
us
but
they'll
have
to
ask
mr.
maroney
about
that
one.
mr.

abt
no,
mr.
justice
fortas.
even
if
we're
wrong
in
our
interpretation
of
--
of
the
dependency
of
is-52
on
the
act
of
registering,
even
if
we're
wrong
on
that,
as
i'm
going
to
attempt
to
persuade
you,
no
questions
that
whether
the
specific
questions
have
now
appear
in
is-52
or
any
other
questions
that
the
attorney
general
could
conceivably
ask
within
his
authority
under
the
act
could
be
non-incriminating.
they
--
they
--
by
the
very
nature
of
the
--
of
the
matter
and
i'm
–
i'm
coming
to
that,
and
i'm
anticipating
what
i'm
going
to
say.
by
the
very
nature
of
the
case,
any
--
any
questions
that
the
attorney
general's
got
authority
to
ask
under
8
(c)
must
necessarily
be
incriminating.
it
couldn't
ask
anything
else.
and
petitioners
have
claimed
their
privilege
against
filing
a
statement.
now,
coming
back
to
--
to
the
act
of
registration
under
the
act
of
the
board's
order
and
form
is-52a,
congress
itself
was
acutely
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
self-registration
of
a
person
under
section
8
(a)
as
a
member
of
a
communist-action
organization,
involves
self-incrimination.
this
appears
from
the
fact
that
it
added
a
partial
immunity
provision,
section
4
(f)
to
the
act
and
it's
made
even
clearer
by
the
legislative
history
of
that
section
which
is
recounted
in
scales
versus
the
united
states.
now,
scales
indicated,
however,
and
as
congress
was
frequently
warned
in
the
course
of
the
debate,
section
4
(f)
does
not
displace
the
privilege.
it
provides
first
that
membership
in
a
communist-action
organization
shall
not
constitute
per
se
a
violation
of
any
criminal
statute.
this
provision
is
inadequate
since
it
does
not
protect
against
prosecutions
for
crimes
like
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act
in
which
membership
is
only
one
ingre
--
ingredient
of
the
offense.
the
section,
second
sentence
of
4
(f)
prohibits
to
recede
an
evidence
of
the
registration
of
a
person
as
a
member
of
a
communist-action
organization
in
a
prosecution
against
him
for
violating
section
4
(a)
or
(c)
or
any
other
criminal
statute.
this
provision
is
indistinguishable
from
the
statute
which
counselman
versus
hitchcock
invalidated
because
it
did
not
afford
the
witness
absolute
immunity
from
prosecution
for
any
offense
to
which
the
incriminating
admission
related.
now,
the
government
acknowledges
as
it
must
under
counselman
that
section
4
(f)
does
not
supplant
the
privilege.
yet
its
argument
was
really
its
only
argument
that
belies
this
acknowledgment.
the
argument
is
that
in
view
of
the
evidentiary
bar
of
section
4
(f),
the
privilege
does
not
protect
the
person
from
being
compelled
to
register
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party
because
this
admission
of
membership
is
not
required
until
after
such
membership
has
been
proved
by
the
attorney
general
in
the
board
proceeding,
and
says
the
government
it
therefore
appears
that
the
admission
will
not
furnish
the
attorney
general
with
any
lead
he
does
not
already
have.
mr.
john
j.
abt
pardon?
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
one
of
the
questions
i'd
like
--
that
i
--
that
i
ask
also,
justice
black,
because
the
fair
majority
in
brown
versus
walker
that
--
that
sustained
a
grant
of
absolute
immunity
as
a
substitute
for
the
privilege
did
so
on
the
theory
that
this
was
a
necessary
aid
to
law
enforcement.
but
under
the
government's
theory,
they
can't
compel
an
admission
unless
the
admission
is
absolutely
valueless
to
the
prosecutor
because
it
doesn't
give
him
any
--
any
information
or
any
leads
that
he
can
use
for
enforcement
purposes.
but
the
government's
proposition
is,
is
that
the
statute
of
the
counselman
type
does
supplant
the
privilege
wherever
the
government
can
show
that
it's
already
in
possession
of
the
incriminating
information
whose
disclosure
it
seeks
to
compel.
that
is
wherever
it
can
show
that
the
disclosure
is
valued
most.
acceptance
of
this
proposition
would
make
deep
in
roads
under
the
protection
--
protection
which
the
privilege
has
long
been
held
to
afford.
up
to
now,
a
claim
of
privilege
has
been
honored
whenever
the
court
was
able
to
discern
some
rational
connection
between
the
disclosures
which
is
sought
and
some
sort
of
criminal
conduct.
no
court
has
ever
believed
that
it
relevant
to
go
on
to
inquire
whether
the
government
already
had
knowledge
of
the
facts
which
it
seeks
to
elicit
from
the
witness.
and
this
has
been
so
whether
the
inquiry
arose
on
a
proceeding
to
which
a
counselman
type
of
statute
was
applicable
or
not.
for
example,
a
counselman
type
of
statute
used
to
be
applicable
to
the
inquiries
of
congressional
committees.
yet
the
court
as
in
the
chief
justice's
decision
in
the
emspack
case
has
sustained
claims
of
privilege
to
the
question,
are
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
in
situations
where
it
appeared
that
the
committee
had
evidence
that
the
witness
was
a
member
and
indeed
as
in
the
emspack
case
where
they
had
made
a
finding
that
the
witness
was
a
member.
the
courts
have
always
thought
that
circumstances
like
these
showing
at
the
body
which
subpoenaed
the
witness
had
incriminating
evidence
against
him
supported
and
bolstered
his
claim
of
privilege.
now,
the
government
claims
that
it
invalidates
the
assertion
of
privilege.
and
as
justice
black
has
already
pointed
out,
the
purpose
of
extorting
this
kind
of
an
admission
or
the
extortion
of
this
kind
of
an
admission
is
as
purposeless
as
it
is
unprecedented.
now
--
now
turning
from
the
act
of
registration
under
section
8
(a)
to
the
registration
statement
required
by
section
8
(c),
if
as
i
have
urged,
the
petitioners
cannot
be
compelled
to
register
under
section
8
(a),
it
is
our
position
that
they're
under
no
duty
to
comply
with
section
8
(c)
for
the
reasons
that
i've
already
indicated.
because
of
the
text
of
the
act,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
penalties,
and
finally
because
of
principle
of
restrict
construction
of
criminal
statutes
would
require
that
kind
of
an
interpretation.
but
even
if
our
interpretation
of
8
(c)
as
being
ancillary
only
to
registration
under
8
(a)
is
rejected.
it's
perfectly
obvious
not
only
that
particularly
--
particular
inquiries
which
the
attorney
general
has
made
in
is
--
form
is-52
call
for
incriminating
answers
but
that
any
inquiries
within
the
attorney
general's
competence
under
section
8
(c)
would
do
so.
if
the
undefined
authority
of
the
attorney
general
under
8
(c)
to
prescribe
the
form
of
registration
statements
is
to
escape
condemnation
as
an
invalid
delegation
of
legislative
power
and
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
seems
obvious
that
its
authority
must
be
confined
to
inquiries
which
bare
some
relation
to
the
registrants,
membership
and
activities
in
the
communist
party.
and
since
federal
legislation
has
made
the
communist
party
what
the
court
of
appeals
called
virtually
a
conspiracy
per
se,
any
such
questions
within
the
attorney
general's
competence
would
obviously
call
for
incriminating
answers.
the
situation
is
these
all
petitions
were
subpoenaed
before
a
grand
jury
and
told
by
the
prosecutor,
“see
here
now.
we're
thinking
about
having
you
indicted
as
a
member
of
a
criminal
conspiracy
headed
up
the
soviet
union
for
the
destruction
of
our
form
of
government.
but
before
we
go
ahead
with
this
indictment,
we'd
like
you
to
answer
a
few
questions.
although
we're
telling
you
now
that
we
know
the
answers
to
many
of
them.
are
you
a
member
of
this
conspiracy?
is
it
the
kind
of
a
conspiracy
i've
just
described?
are
you
also
an
officer
of
this
outfit?
what
are
your
duties?
give
us
all
your
aliases.
where
and
when
were
you
born?”
and
so
on.
now,
generations
of
lawyers
have
advised
their
clients
that
in
situations
like
that,
you
don't
have
to
answer
such
questions.
and
decisions,
like
mr.
justice
clark's
decision
in
hoffman
versus
united
states
have
sustained
us
in
this
advice.
now,
the
government
tells
us
we've
been
all
wrong.
and
that
the
answers
can
be
compelled.
its
contention,
apart
from
the
proposition
that
the
privilege
is
inapplicable
where
the
government
already
knows
the
answers,
is
that
what
euphemistically
calls
identifying
information,
it's
indistinguishable
from
fingerprinting
and
as
outside
the
privilege.
now,
whatever
may
be
the
case
with
fingerprinting
or
other
means
of
physical
identification,
the
registration
statement
like
the
questioning
of
a
prosecutor
is
a
demand
for
communication
and
is
indisputably
within
the
protection
of
privilege.
we
make
four
other
constitutional
objections
to
the
member
registration
requirement.
first,
we
say
that
since
as
i
have
shown,
the
requirement
has
no
legitimate
governmental
purpose,
the
restraint
which
it
imposes
on
individual
liberty
is
a
denial
of
substantive
due
process.
second,
we
say,
that
this
due
process
defect
is
compounded
by
the
fact
that
compulsories
self-registration
is
a
form
of
compelled
communication
and
hence
within
the
ambit
of
the
first
amendment.
the
act
singles
out
the
members
of
a
particular
group
and
compels
them
both
to
avow
their
political
affiliation
and
to
admit
to
the
truth
of
the
governmental
finding
that
the
party
to
which
they
belong
is
a
seditious
conspiracy
under
foreign
control.
the
act
thus
coerces
persons
to
make
those
durations
which
are
contrary
to
their
conscience
and
belief,
invasions
of
their
privacy,
and
self-defamatory.
moreover,
the
self-registration
requirement
is
a
restraint
on
the
individual's
right
of
association
and
for
that
reason
also,
they're
subject
to
first
amendment
limitations.
decisions
of
this
court,mr.
justice
harlan's
in
barenblatt
for
example,
holding
that
the
first
amendment
did
not
prohibit
inquiry
into
a
person's
membership
in
the
communist
party
reached
that
conclusion
on
the
ground
that
the
government's
interest
in
obtaining
an
answer
outweighed
the
interest
of
the
individual
in
privacy.
and
it
was
on
similar
grounds
that
the
court
sustained
the
registration
order
in
the
party
case.
here,
if
we
are
once
more
to
balance
self-registration
as
i
have
shown,
serves
no
conceivable
public
interest.
so
there
is
nothing
to
balance
off
against
the
claim
of
the
individual
to
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
next,
we
argue
that
petitioners
were
denied
procedural
due
process
by
the
act
and
the
board's
ruling,
both
of
which
precluded
them
from
challenging
the
1953
determination
that
the
communist
party
is
a
communist-action
organization.
this
due
process
violation
results
first
from
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
were
not
parties
to
the
proceeding
in
which
the
determination
was
made.
moreover,
even
if
they
could
be
held
to
be
bound
in
their
absence,
they
would
still
be
entitled
to
litigate
the
current
validity
of
this
determination.
now,
12
years
old
and
based
primarily
on
what
the
chief
justice
characterized
as
stale
evidence
of
the
events
that
antedate
1940.
the
majority
in
the
party
case
held
that
the
provisions
of
section
13
of
the
act,
submitting
a
registered
organization
periodically
to
seek
a
redetermination
of
its
status,
saved
the
act
as
to
the
organization
from
condemnation
under
the
due
process
clause
and
the
prohibition
against
bills
of
attainder.
but
the
communist
party
cannot
ask
for
a
redetermination
under
section
13
since
it
is
not
registered
and
is
still
litigating
the
constitutionality
of
the
requirement
that
it
do
so.
moreover,
if
it
wins
this
litigation,
establish
its
right
not
to
be
compelled
to
register,
it
can
never
apply
for
a
redetermination
under
the
act.
and
the
act
does
not
permit
a
member
to
seek
such
a
redetermination
whether
or
not,
he
or
the
organization
is
registered.

opinion
and
i
so
read
the
act,
mr.
justice
fortas.

on
the
act
which
permits
to
do
that.
mr.
john
j.
abt
right.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
we
made
no
offer
of
proof.
mr.
forer
reminds
me
that
there
was
a
denial
in
our
answers
of
the
attorney
general's
allegation
in
the
petition
that
the
organization
is
a
communist-action
organization.
and
the
only
proof
that
the
attorney
general
offered
of
that
allegation
was
his
request
for
judicial
notice
of
the
board's
1953
determination.
the
party
case
also
recognized
that
the
validity
of
the
board's
1953
determination
at
any
future
time
would
depend
upon
the
validity
at
that
time
of
the
board's
conclusion
that
the
soviet
union
is
the
unnamed
foreign
power
referred
to
in
section
2
which
controls
a
monolithic
world
communist
movement
described
in
that
section.
accordingly,
the
court
held
that
as
due
process
requires,
the
soundness
of
this
conclusion
in
the
right
--
in
the
light
of
the
contemporaneous
political
realities
would
be
subject
to
review
by
the
board
or
the
courts
in
any
subsequent
proceeding
under
the
act.
today,
it
is
common
knowledge
that
communism
is
characterized
by
what
the
experts
call
polycentrism.
and
that
the
section
2
model
of
a
monolithic
world
movement
under
soviet
discipline
and
control
is
strictly
mythological.
in
the
fable,
it
was
a
child
who
announced
the
truth
about
the
emperor's
new
clothes.
under
the
party
case,
since
the
board
has
not
done
so,
it
evolves
upon
the
court
to
make
a
similar
pronouncement
about
section
2
and
the
board's
1953
determination
which
rests
on
section
2.
finally,
we
argue
that
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
not
under
the
act,
mr.
justice
harlan,
because
the
party
hasn't
registered.
under
the
act,
the
right
to
seek
a
redetermination
is
only
given
to
an
organization
which
registers.
mr.
john
j.
abt
there's
no
provision
on
the
act
which
permits
it.
the
government
says,
well
they
could
--
they
could
find
some
other
kind
of
proceeding
but
it
never
--
it
never
indicates
what
kind
of
a
proceeding
it
could
find
and
--
and
we
don't
know
of
any,
we
don't
think
there
is
any.
the
act
contemplated
that
you
have
to
register
before
you
could
go
in
and
then
ask
for
an
escape.
and
what
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
right.
they
have
no
standing
under
the
act.
no
standing
your
honor.
what
i
think
the
court
overlooked,
if
i
may
say
so,
with
the
majority
in
the
--
in
the
1961
decision
was
that
these
questions
of
which
the
court
held
at
that
time
to
be
premature
would
take
an
awful
long
time
to
--
to
litigate
and
get
decided
and
might
be
decided
in
favor
of
the
organization.
and
under
those
circumstances,
there'd
be
no
possibility
for
a
redetermination.
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
we
say
that
under
the
reasoning
of
the
party
case
itself,
we're
denied
or
our
clients
are
denied
due
process
and
are
subject
to
attainder.
our
final
constitutional
point
is
that
the
act
deprives
petitioners
in
criminal
prosecutions
for
failing
to
register
of
their
right
to
grand
jury
indictment,
trial
by
judge
and
jury,
and
the
requirement
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
act
does
this
by
making
the
findings
of
the
board
that
petitioners
are
members
of
the
communist
party
and
that
latter
is
a
communist-action
organization,
and
these
are
the
two
basic
requisites
of
criminal
liability
conclusive
upon
the
petitioners
in
the
criminal
proceedings.
the
act
excludes
these
issues.
the
vital
and
controversial
parts
of
the
offense
of
failing
to
register
from
the
consideration
of
judge
and
jury
and
provides
for
their
determination
by
an
administrative
agency.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no
but
if
you
read
the
act,
it
appears
from
the
face
of
the
act.
mr.
john
j.
abt
right.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
abt
right.
mr.
john
j.
abt
right.
mr.
john
j.
abt
the
government
agrees
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
not
yet.
we
say
that
one
makes
the
act
unconstitutional,
justice
black.
the
government
agrees
that
the
only
issue
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
they
say
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
exactly
what
they
say.
and
i
say
that's
--
that's
the
usual
thing,
nothing
--
nothing
unusual
about
it
at
all.
but
obviously,
if
congress
can
circumvent
jury
trials
and
the
other
safeguards
of
the
constitution
by
the
device
of
framing
our
criminal
statute
in
such
a
way
as
to
split
off
for
administrative
determination,
the
primary
factual
issues
on
which
criminal
liability
depends,
all
the
constitutional
provisions
for
the
protection
of
the
accused
that
we
have
often
always
thought
were
the
foundation
of
liberty
in
this
country
would
have
lost
their
meaning
completely.
mr.
john
j.
abt
exactly
so,
that's
their
argument.
they
also
argue
that
our
contention
is
premature
and
must
await
petitioners'
criminal
prosecutions
for
failure
to
register.
but
ex
parte
young
establishes
that
petitioners
are
entitled
to
have
that
issue
decided
in
this
proceeding
and
can't
be
required
to
risk
the
act's
fantastic
criminal
penalties
as
a
price
of
securing
an
adjudication
of
their
constitutional
rights.
in
conclusion,
the
act,
a
product
of
the
savage
anticommunist
repression
of
the
early
1950s
would
institutionalize
mccarthyism
and
violate
basic
constitutional
guarantees
on
which
personal
liberty
has
always
been
thought
to
rest
in
this
country.
and
as
the
experience
of
those
years,
a
decade
ago,
once
again
demonstrated
these
guarantees
cannot
be
withheld
from
any
group,
communists
or
otherwise,
without
denying
them
to
every
american.
we
say
that
the
member
registration
requirement
of
the
act
should
be
invalidated
and
the
board's
order
set
aside
as
incompatible
with
these
constitutional
guarantees.
thank
you.
