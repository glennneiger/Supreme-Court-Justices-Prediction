mr.
abt
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
government
as
i
understand
it
makes
a
distinction
between
their
registrations
which
is
--
as
i
read
it,
concedes
his
right
for
adjudication
and
the
filing
--
in
the
filing
of
a
statement
which
it
argues
is
not
right
for
adjudication.
is
that
your
understanding
of
their
position?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
mr.
abt
that
form
is-52a
states,
this
form
should
be
accompanied
by
a
registration
statement,
form
is-52
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
is
--
is
it
--
what
is
your
position
with
respect
to
the
meaning
and
the
effect
of
that
statement?
in
other
words,
could
these
individuals
register
or
accomplish
what
the
government
refers
to
as
a
mere
fact
of
registration
without
filing
the
registration
statement?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
you
are
right.
and
if
i
follow
you,
you
seem
to
agree
that
the
two
things
are
severable.
justice
abe
fortas
but
then
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
do
you
agree
that
the
only
thing
that
before
this
court
presently,
is
form
is-52a,
that
is
to
say
the
failure
of
registration.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
abt,
can
you
without
directing
your
argument
too
much,
tell
me
where
in
the
record
is
the
ruling
of
the
board
below
that
they
would
not
receive
evidence
as
to
the
character
of
the
communist
party.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
--
did
you
make
an
offer
of
proof?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
--
it
was
--
well
then,
your
position
rather
is
that
the
board
had
the
affirmative
duty,
then
your
objection
as
to
the
board
taking
judicial
notice
of
the
--
of
its
own
order
previously
entered
in
the
communist
party
case.
justice
abe
fortas
but
there
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
my
question
is
really
this.
is
there
a
clear
ruling
by
the
board
that
you
would
not
be
permitted
to
introduce
evidence
attacking
the
validity
of
the
order
entered
in
the
communist
party
case?
justice
abe
fortas
the
legitimate
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
a
different
matter.
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
make
an
offer
of
proof?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
maroney,
at
page
25
in
your
brief,
you
say
we
do
--
excuse
me.
we
do
not
contend
that
this
is
an
immunity
provision
which
supplants
the
privilege
within
the
meaning
of
counselman
versus
hitchcock
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
it
or
isn't
--
is
it
or
is
it
not
the
government's
position
that
4
(f)
as
enacted
is
an
--
is
an
effect
of
immunity
provision.
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
help
has
it
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
i
understand
it
--
as
i
understand
what
you've
come
down
to
then
is
not
an
argument
that
there
is
an
effect
of
immunity
provision
here
with
an
argument
to
the
effect
that
the
act
of
registration
is
meaningless.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
a
little
troubled
with
the
result
that
you
gave.
i'm
a
little
troubled
with
the
counselman
but
you
don't
claim
that
murphy
overruled
the
counselman.
