justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
a
hearing
provided
that
the
attorney
general
makes
such
an
application
to
find
the
mem
--
an
alleged
member
--
a
member?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
was
in
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
a
new
indictment
with
that?

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
saying
in
effect
is,
this
is
some
of
the
peculiar
circumstances,
this
is
not
an
effective
claim
of
privilege.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
what
--
what
you're
saying
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
you're
not
trying
to
get
us
to
receive
from
counselman
against
hitchcock.
you
said
that
in
your
brief.
what
you're
saying
is
that
congress
rightly
or
wrongly,
the
congress
rightly
or
wrongly
thought
that
it
is
a
result
of
a
peculiar
combination
of
the
limited
exclusion,
limited
immunity,
the
use
of
colloquialism
afforded
by
4
(f)
plus
the
requirement
that
there
must
be
an
administrative
adjudication
that
the
man
was
a
communist
on
hearing
and
judicial
notice
that
in
no
circumstances
the
counselman
doctrine
would
not
give
the
man
a
valid
claim
and
privilege.
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
john
m.
harlan
without
suggesting
that
the
argument
is
sound
in
our
view.
that's
what
you're
saying.
you're
not
trying
to
get
this
court
to
overrule
counselman
against
hitchcock,
are
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
didn't
understand
you
to
be
contending
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
it's
a
--
it's
a
lead,
mr.
maroney.
