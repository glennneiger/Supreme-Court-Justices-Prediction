black
what
does
it
want
with
the
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
it
does
that
in
case
they
can
be
prosecuted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
in
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
that
the
act
contemplates
in
which
then
could
be
tried
failing
to
obey
this
order.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
government's
address
on
the
administrative
findings
on
essential
allegation
of
criminal
charge
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
belongs
to
the
communist
party.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
the
communist
party
was
a
seditious
organization.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
has
not
been
decided
by
this
court
not
yet.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
insist
here
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
they
could
take
that
essential
part
of
the
crime
to
with
which
they
charge
you
and
rest
simply
by
saying
that
this
administrative
agency
had
found
that
to
be
a
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
that
that
is
correct.
the
man
is
charged
with
stealing
in
the
property
of
a,
an
administrative
agency
request
to
find
that
the
property
belongs
to
a
that
when
he
was
charged
with
stealing,
the
government
can
rest
by
approving
that
one
of
his
administrative
values
had
found
belonging
to
a.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
(inaudible)
we
should
cut
down
counselman
versus
hitchcock?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
recognize
that
there's
such
a
rule
exists
and
then
you're
trying
to
get
around
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
not
--
suppose
you
substitute
for
the
word
lead,
make
it
absolutely
certain
that
what
they
have
said
is
true.
that's
about
what
it
is,
isn't
it?
you
say
that
they
have
looked
around
and
found
some
evidence
to
satisfy
the
administrative
board
for
you
to
come
in
therefore,
thereafter
that,
he
couldn't
claim
any
privilege.
hence,
the
government
knew
he
told
you
as
a
communist
and
therefore
couldn't
get
any
lead
from
his
announcing
to
the
world
that
he
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
the
government
is
there
before
at
any
case
that
you
know
of
made
such
an
argument
about
counselman
and
hitchcock.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
that
ever
been
presented
to
the
court
as
the
government's
position
of
the
board?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
any
case
ever
said
that
the
government
was
insisting
on
that
restricted
meaning
of
counselman
and
hitchcock.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
it's
consistent
but
have
they
ever
argued
that
it
was
consistent
with
the
board
to
at
least
take
it
as
a
whole
as
having
its
complete
immunity
that
counselman
and
hitchcock
had
indicated
(voice
overlap)
certainly
in
any
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
has
anybody
ever
made
an
argument
like
that
before
that
you
know
of?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
--
what's
the
opinion?
but
if
you
don't
have
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
anything
in
counselman,
says
anything
like
that,
i've
just
read
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
may
indicate
or
suggest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
may
indicate
or
suggest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
law
that
was
held
unconstitutional
there
provided
substantially
precisely
what
congress
is
doing
here,
didn't
it,
that
they
couldn't
use
it
for
the
purpose
of
convicting
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
that
law
was
that
they
held
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
did
have
the
belief
of
prosecuting
attorney
that
this
man
was
guilty.
therefore,
he
didn't
think
he
needed
anymore
leads.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
leads.
justice
hugo
l.
black
certainly
not
conclusive,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
conclusion
that
the
man
was
a
communist
when
the
government
goes
and
send
him
to
the
penitentiary
for
being
one
if
he
does?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
government
attempts
to
send
him
to
the
penitentiary
for
being
a
communist,
do
you
think
that
this
finding
of
the
board
is
conclusive
on
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whatever
the
question
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
forget
the
question.
i'm
just
simply
asking
you
if
you
are
arguing
now
the
part
of
your
argument
that
the
--
the
attorney
general
having
found
this
by
administrative
agencies,
it
certainly
is
not
there
for
life,
doesn't
have
an
independent
job
for
life
that
a
judge
does.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
may
i
read
you
just
this
--
what
the
senate
says
in
counselman
and
see
if
what
you
are
asking
is
not
that
they'd
be
repudiated
in
part.
it
follows
speaking
of
the
act
under
considerations
that
any
evidence
which
might
have
been
obtained
from
counselman
by
means
of
his
examination
before
the
grand
jury
would
not
be
given
evidence
used
against
him
or
his
property
in
any
court
of
the
united
states.
that's
what
this
one
does,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
any
criminal
proceeding
or
for
the
enforcement
of
any
penalty
or
force
that's
what
this
man
has
undertaken
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
of
course
protected
him
against
the
use
of
his
testimony
against
him
or
his
property
in
any
prosecution
against
him
or
his
property
in
any
criminal
proceeding
in
the
court
of
the
united
states.
that's
the
ca
--
case
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
had
only
that
effect.
that's
right
here,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
it
hasn't.
does
it
have
any
other
effect
besides
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
that
other
statute.
i'm
talking
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i'm
talking
about
this
provision
of
(f).
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all
it
does.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
could
not
and
would
not
prevent
the
use
of
his
testimony
to
search
out
other
testimony
to
be
use
in
evidence
against
him
or
his
property
in
a
criminal
proceeding
in
such
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
it
could
here,
couldn't
it?
are
you
saying
that
they
don't
need
it
but
it
could,
couldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
--
forget
the
word
lead.
they
didn't
use
the
word
lead.
what
they
said
is
this.
it
could
not
and
would
not
prevent
the
use
of
his
testimony
to
search
out
other
testimony
to
be
used
in
evidence
against
him
or
his
property,
that's
right
here,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
a
criminal
proceeding
in
such
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
say
that
--
you
say
that
because
you
think
the
attorney
general
didn't
need
any
leads
to
convict
him
of
some
crime,
these
were
not
limited
to
this
particular
crime
charged,
is
to
be
used
to
search
out
evidence
to
get
him
for
violating
the
law
of
the
united
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
does
this
act
under
consideration
know
that
far?
does
it
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
it
does.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
rely
for
counselman?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
attacking
the
man
--
you're
attacking
the
principle,
aren't
you,
that
under
all
circumstances
a
man
who
is
compelled
to
testify
that
he
cannot
–
that
that
immunity
is
sufficient
to
make
him
do
it
so
long
even
though
it
does
not
prevent
the
use
of
that
testimony
thereafter
or
whatever
except
in
the
courtroom.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
certainly
didn't
understand
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
couldn't
it?
why
can't
it
be
an
evidence
to
get
many
things
against
the
man
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
he
admits
only
that
he's
guilty
of
an
offense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
link
to
prove
of
the
essential
evidence
of
the
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
we
said
in
blau
and
it
couldn't
be
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
normal
just
--
this
is
abnormal.
this
is
communist.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
the
government
won't
--
won't
put
him
into
danger?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
it
just
a
futile
gesture?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
can
they
use
it
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
can
they
use
it
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
can
the
government
use
this
for
that
it
can't
use
in
the
finding
of
the
subversive
activities
board?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
about
the
argument,
i'm
just
asking
what
can
it
use
it
for
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
(voice
overlap)
that
it's
already
been
conclusively
determined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wanted
that
from
--
wanted
that
from
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
they
want
with
that
about
his
aliases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
you
--
you
can't
see
where
that
could
be
used
as
a
lead
to
getting
things
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
that
it'd
be
recognized?
justice
hugo
l.
black
proper
circumstances
that
were
determined
by
the
attorney
general?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they'd
have
to
come
to
court
that
would
be
the
court
deciding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
other
question
because
i
have
been
surprised,
i
must
confess
somewhat
this
considered
by
the
claims
of
the
government
made
here.
this
counselman
versus
hitchcock
was
decided
six
to
seven
years
ago,
would
you
mind
if
you
can
find
any
case
by
the
majority
of
opinion
of
this
court
since
that
time
as
indicated
that
there
were
any
circumstances
under
which
the
principle
it
announced
namely
that
the
statute
of
this
kind
that
did
know
more
than
this
is
unconstitutional
as
ever
been
questioned
by
this
court.
if
you
can
find
it,
would
you
give
them
to
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
so.
i
just
read
that
but
i
didn't
think
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
a
little
more
than
that.
i
don't
--
i
want
you
to
understand
it.
what
i
want
to
know
is,
what
counselman
versus
hitchcock
said
without
any
“ifs”,
or
“ands”,
or
“buts”
as
i
read
it,
that
where
a
statute
did
no
more
into
that
immunity,
the
prosecution
to
what
was
compelled
to
be
given,
it
was
not
enough
to
meet
the
constitutional
test.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
did,
alright.
now,
have
you
found
any
case
or
i'd
like
you
if
you
can
find
any
case
indicates
that
there
are
any
circumstances
of
any
kind
decided
by
this
court,
circumstances
of
any
kind
that
can
impinge
on
that
broad
doctrine
(voice
overlap,
would
you
cite
it
to
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
whether
you
think
it's
a
good
law.
i
want
to
know
if
there's
been
any
case
which
indicates
that
the
doctrine
--
that
the
statute
is
not
enough
to
meet
the
con
--
the
limits
of
statute
meet
the
constitutional
test
when
the
only
immunity
it
grants
is
the
immunity
from
having
particular
evidence
compelled,
used
against
it.
that's
the
general
principle
that's
announced.
and
i
want
to
know
if
you
can
find
any
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
indicates
that
that
can
be
impend
on
by
reason
of
any
particular
circumstances.
well,
this
court
have
indicated
that
it
might.
as
i've
read
the
cases,
they've
actually
broadened
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
had
been
a
statute
providing
precisely
what
counselman
and
hitchcock
did
about
the
constitution.
the
statute
said
it
shall
not
be
enough
to
justify
interrogating
a
man,
getting
him
to
make
himself
a
witness
against
himself
to
--
he
cannot
do
that
under
any
circumstances,
cannot
do
that
if
all
what
the
immunity
statute
says
is,
that
just
what
said
here.
and
it
was
a
statute
and
the
court
--
and
there
had
been
no
reasons
given
by
congress
for
passing
the
statute,
what
would
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
many
statutes
are
passed
to
the
effect
that
testimony,
a
man
who
is
compelled
to
give
testimony
against
himself
cannot
be
compelled
to
give
testimony
against
himself
unless
some
more
immunity
is
made
in
a
mere
provision
that
he
shall
not
be
prosecuted
until
his
testimony
is
compelled.
suppose
the
statute
said
that
and
no
more,
what
would
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
except
you
say
that
counselman
gave
some
reasons
which
thereby
make
you
want
to
find
a
way
that
makes
the
government
feel
that
it
can
offer
new
situation
and
not
follow
what
was
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
reasons
--
the
reasons.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
basing
--
you're
basing
it
on
--
you
say
the
reasons
or
such.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
the
statute
just
--
just
provided
what
counselman
did
without
giving
any
reason.
what
would
you
say
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
the
statute
and
under
the
statute,
not
counselman.
justice
hugo
l.
black
didn't
state
its
reasons.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
gather
you
to
say
that
it
said
it
did
it
because
there
was
a
lead.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
get
down
here
then
from
your
argument
or
statement,
there
could
be
no
possible
lead
provided
to
the
attorney
general
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
by
having
this
man
registered
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
bring
about
a
conviction
of
him
for
anything
in
any
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
arises
to
any
mind,
i
should
think
that
he
did.
how
far
can
the
government
go
in
asking
questions
that
are
wholly
irrelevant
and
wholly
futile
to
any
governmental
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
an
advantage
or
disadvantage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
advantage
of
that
or
there
is
a
disadvantage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
it's
been
found
that
yet
to
restore
the
fifth
amendment.
