mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
clear
that
the
central
question
in
this
case
relates
to
the
fifth
amendment,
although
many
other
issues
are
raised
both
in
their
brief
and
in
argument.
the
first
amendment
questions,
we
submit,
are
--
were
substantially
settled
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
communist
party
case.
they
do
make
a
--
a
distinction
here
as
to
purpose
--
as
to
governmental
purpose
following
disclosure
during
the
course
of
a
board
proceeding
and
i
intend
to
discuss
that
in
a
few
minutes.
but
before
discussing
the
fifth
amendment
question,
i
would
like
to
take
just
a
few
minutes
to
discuss
their
contention
that
section
4
(f)
is
not
sufficiently
sweeping
to
cover
--
to
preclude
the
use
of
the
fact
of
registration
for
prosecution
especially
under
sections
5
and
15
of
--
of
the
internal
security
act.
they
make
the
claim
supposedly
based
on
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
that
because
the
house
version
of
the
bill
contained
a
specific
provision
which
would
have
precluded
the
fact
of
registration
from
being
used
in
connection
with
proving
violations
of
section
5
and
6
of
the
act.
and
since
those
specific
provisions
were
later
eliminated
following
the
conference
between
the
house
and
the
senate,
they
conclude
that
it
was
thereby
the
intent
of
congress
to
not
have
applicable
to
the
violations
set
forth
in
section
5
and
6,
the
immunity
provisions
of
section
4
(f).
we
think
that
the
--
the
history
of
the
bills
as
they
progress
through
the
congress
makes
it
quite
clear
that
section
4
(f)
was
intended
to
be
and
does
in
fact
in
specific
words,
was
intended
to
preclude
the
use
of
the
fact
of
registration
in
any
criminal
prosecution.
now,
the
--
the
wood
bill
which
was
the
house
--
which
was
the
bill
that
pass
the
house
had
in
sections
5
--
sections
4,
5
and
6,
each
of
which
established
new
offenses.
each
of
those
provisions
in
the
wood
bill
as
it
came
out
of
the
committee
provided
that
the
fact
of
registration
cannot
be
used
in
evidence
to
prove
the
violation
previously
set
forth
in
this
section.
so
that
each
section,
4,
5
and
6
had
a
similar
provision
and
it
related
particularly
to
the
section
in
which
it
was.
now,
on
the
floor
of
the
house
when
the
question
was
being
debated,
congressman
cellar
and
mark
antonio
made
the
objection
that
the
provision
--
that
the
immunity
provision
set
forth
in
--
in
these
sections
was
not
sufficiently
broad,
that
it
would
permit
for
example
the
use
of
the
proof
of
the
fact
of
registration
in
a
smith
act
prosecution.
since
this
clearly
was
not
the
intent
of
the
sponsors
of
the
bill,
the
bill
was
amended
on
the
floor
subsequently
so
that
section
4
(f)
was
made
to
read
that
the
fact
of
registration
shall
not
be
received
in
evidence
for
a
violation
of
subsection
(a)
and
(c)
of
this
--
this
section
which
was
the
original
wording
and
they
added
for
in
the
prosecution
of
any
other
criminal
case.sections
5
and
6
were
left
as
they
were.
the
senate
versions
did
not
have
comparable
provisions
in
sections
5
and
6.
that
is
they
didn't
have
comparable
immunity
provisions.
it
did
have
a
comparable
section
4
(f)
without
the
phraseology
for
any
other
criminal
prosecution.
and
when
the
bills
went
to
congress,
the
final
version
came
out
with
section
4
(f)
being
all
inclusive
or
any
other
criminal
prosecution.
nothing
said
in
section
5
or
section
6
obviously
because
they
were
already
covered
by
the
all
inclusive
wording
or
section
4
(f).
and
the
--
i
think
that
that
history
coupled
with
the
--
the
very
phraseology
itself
plus
the
fact
--
plus
the
fact
that
it
was
a
purpose.
the
clear
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
this
legislation
was
to
require
disclosure
and
not
to
secure
incriminating
admissions
from
the
registrants.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir,
not
--
not
in
the
sense
of
the
normal
immunity
statute
such
as
that
involved
for
example
in
the
olman
case
where
--
where
the
congress
legislates
that
a
person
cannot
be
prosecuted
for
--
or
in
connection
with
any
offense
concerning
which
he
is
compelled
to
testify.
of
course
that
is
the
--
the
complete
immunity
statute.
this
is
not
a
complete
immunity
statute
in
of
itself.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
our
position
here
is
that
congress
has
provided,
effectively
provided,
that
the
fact
of
registration
cannot
be
used
in
evidence
in
any
criminal
prosecution
against
a
registrant.
now,
that
in
it
of
itself
would
not
meet
the
rule
of
the
counselman
case.
but
what
takes
this
out
of
the
rule
of
the
counselman
case
is
the
fact
that
in
these
cases,
we
have
had
a
board
hearing
at
which
the
attorney
general
at
his
initiative
has
been
called
upon
and
has
produced
evidence
showing
that
these
people
are
members
of
the
communist
party.
that
fact,
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
had
the
lead,
so
to
speak,
that
these
people
were
members
of
the
communist
party,
was
able
to
produce
evidence
sufficient
to
sustain
the
requirement
of
the
act
to
establish
that
they
were
members
of
the
communist
party,
taken
together
with
the
--
what
i
will
short
handedly
call
the
immunity
provisions
of
section
4
(f)
are
sufficiently
effective
to
remove
any
--
any
fear
of
self-incrimination.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
not
meaningless,
your
honor,
but
that
it
--
it
--
it
cannot
put
them
in
any
danger
in
view
of
the
circumstances
--
in
view
of
section
4
(f)
and
the
board
proceeding,
which
has
preceded
this
requirement
that
they're
register.
in
view
of
that
combination
of
circumstances,
they
cannot,
in
the
law,
be
in
any
fear
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment
that
the
act
of
registration
would
be
an
incriminatory
act.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
no,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
we
specifically
recognized
the
rule
of
counselman
and
we
say
that
in
this
case
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
we
say
this
--
this
doesn't
come
within
the
rule
of
counselman
because
the
problem
in
the
counselman
case
was
that
although
the
testimony,
the
compelled
testimony
could
not
be
used
in
evidence
against
the
person
making
the
fifth
amendment
claim.
the
fact
of
his
giving
the
testimony
and
the
details
of
his
testimony
could
have
been
used
by
the
government
to
secure
a
lead
which
could
then
have
been
used
against
him.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
the
government
certainly
had
the
lead
to
begin
with.
the
government
had
the
lead
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
party
or
the
attorney
general
would
not
have
filed
the
petition
for
a
hearing
before
the
board
and
he
would
not
have
been
in
a
position
to
produce
evidence
sufficient
for
the
board's
determination
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
that
--
that
our
basic
position
concerning
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
scope
of
counselman.
i
think
it
has
been
taken.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
not
that
i
know
of,
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
meaning
of
counselman?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
the
meaning
we're
putting
on
counselman
is
--
is
consistent
with
the
meaning
that
has
been
put
on
counselman.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
no.
of
course,
we're
--
we
say
that
under
the
rule
counselman
v.
hitchcock,
the
counselman
court
would
hold
that
the
registrant
has
no
good
fifth
amendment
claim
in
this
case.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
the
argument
has
frequently
been
made
(voice
overlap)
in
murphy
v.
waterfront
commission.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
that's
a
recent
case
decided
by
this
court
relating
to
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
have
it.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it's
the
--
it's
378
u.s.
52.
now,
the
situation
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
let
me
say
this,
your
honor.
the
situation
in
murphy
v.
waterfront
commission
was
this.
the
question
was
whether
a
state
immunity
statute
under
which
a
witness
was
being
compelled
to
answer
was
sufficient
to
give
him
immunity
from
federal
prosecution.
now,
this
court
in
the
--
in
the
murphy
case
laid
down
the
ruling
that
if
he
was
compelled
in
a
state
proceeding
to
testify
in
an
incriminatory
fashion
concerning
criminal
offenses
that
the
fifth
amendment
would
bar
the
use
by
the
federal
government
not
only
of
the
evidence
to
which
he
testified
but
of
leads
derived
from
such
evidence.
so
that
--
so
that
the
court
was
saying
that
although
his
testimony
is
compelled
and
some
other
jurisdiction
might
secure
leads,
the
fifth
amendment
would
not
permit
those
leads
to
be
used
against
him
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
what
the
court
has
said
in
--
in
the
murphy
case,
what
it
was
saying
in
counselman
is
that
if
the
circumstances
under
which
he
is
called
upon
to
--
to
testify
or
to
make
an
admission
or
such,
if
the
circumstances
are
such
that
his
answers
cannot
possibly
incriminate
then
his
fifth
amendment
claim
is
of
no
avail
to
him.
when
the
reason
for
the
privilege
ceases,
the
privilege
ceases.
and
we
think
that's
the
situation
here.
and
it's
due
to
the
peculiar
combination
of
circumstances
which
i
certainly
agree
is
a
peculiar
combination
of
circumstances.
i
don't
know
of
any
other
previous
situation
in
which
--
in
which
we've
had
this
kind
of
a
combination.
i
think
the
case
is
unique
in
that
respect.
but
you
have
section
4
(f)
which
is
an
absolute
ban
on
the
government
from
using
this
in
any
criminal
prosecution
and
you
have
the
clearly
demonstrated
fact
that
the
government
already
has
the
lead.
that
is,
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
the
--
the
objection
that
was
made
by
congress
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
language
of
the
act
i
rely
on
is
section
4
(f).
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
which
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
51.
the
second
sentence
of
section
4
(f),
the
fact
of
the
registration
of
any
person
under
section
7
or
section
8
of
this
title
as
an
officer
or
member
of
any
communist
organization
shall
not
be
received
in
evidence
against
such
person
in
any
prosecution
or
any
alleged
violation
of
subsection
(a)
or
subsection
(c)
of
this
section
or
for
any
alleged
violation
of
any
other
criminal
statute.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
it
doesn't
say
that
the
fruits
shall
not
be,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
don't
think
congress
here
intended
to
give
that
kind
of
immunity,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
congress
intended
to
immunize
for
past
offenses.
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
enacting
section
4
(f)
was
to
eliminate
the
--
the
--
the
possible
danger
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
registration
requirements
of
the
statute
by
this
language
which
would
--
would
not
permit
a
proper
fifth
amendment
claim
with
respect
to
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
no,
your
honor.
our
--
position
is
quite
to
the
contrary.
we
say
that
the
government
cannot
by
virtue
of
section
of
4
(f)
make
use
of
the
--
of
this
registration
materials
for
the
purpose
of
introducing
it
against
the
registrant
in
any
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
a
fruit
that
the
government
might
derive
from
the
information
on
the
statement?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
in
the
first
place,
that
since
this
is
a
--
this
would
be
in
response
to
a
--
would
be
a
compelled
disclosure
that
the
fifth
amendment
itself
prohibits
the
government
from
using
the
fruits
that
might
be
derived
from
the
compelled
disclosure.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
is
your
honor
talking
about
a
compelled
registration
or
a
voluntary
registration?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
under
this
order.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
i'm
--
i
just
want
to
make
the
distinction,
your
honor
that
the
statute
imposes
an
obligation
on
every
member
of
the
communist
party
to
register.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
now,
of
course,
he
could
come
in
and
voluntarily
register.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
if
he
came
in
without
compulsion
of
a
board
order,
it
would
be
voluntary.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
he's
not
in
any
danger
of
going
to
the
penitentiary
unless
there
is
an
existence,
an
order
of
the
board
against
him
requiring
him
to
register.
now,
if
there
is
an
order
of
the
board
–-
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
only
if
the
attorney
general
petitions
in
each
particular
case,
your
honor,
and
--
and
then
of
course
it
depends
on
the
attorney
general
being
in
a
position
to
make
a
satisfactory
showing
that
the
person
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
then
of
course,
the
board
would
issue
an
order
requiring
the
person
to
register.
and
we
say
that
in
no
circumstances
that
the
government
would
then
not
be
in
a
position
to
use
the
registration
in
any
criminal
offense
and
--
and
it's
perfectly
clear
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
was
able
to
ask
for
a
petition,
was
able
to
produce
evidence
that
the
government
could
not
have
derive
a
lead.
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
sir?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
it's
--
it's
evident
because
before
he
registered
as
a
member
of
the
party,
the
attorney
general
had
to
make
a
representation
to
the
board
that
he
had
the
reason
to
believe
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
party
and
had
to
be
in
a
position
to
prove.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
your
honor,
in
the
first
place
it
depends
on
competent
evidence
being
produced
before
the
board.
but
the
point
--
my
point
is
that
it
certainly
isn't
a
lead.
the
fact
that
he
comes
in
following
a
board
order
is
not
leading
the
attorney
general
for
the
first
time
to
the
idea
that
this
man
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
the
attorney
general
had
that
idea
before
he
came
in.
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
counselman
says
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
sir?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
counselman
says
that
the
statute
in
counselman
was
not
sufficiently
broad
because
it
didn't
prohibit
the
government
from
deriving
leads
and
using
leads
from
the
information
that
was
required
to
be
testified
to.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
you
didn't
have
the
accompanying
circumstance
of
--
of
a
prior
petition
by
the
attorney
general
on
this
narrow
fact
now,
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
a
--
and
proof
before
the
board
as
to
membership
in
the
communist
party.
now,
i
might
say
we've
–-
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
but
you
didn't
have
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
but
you
didn't
have
a
record
which
showed
as
it
does
here.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
it's
conclusive
that
the
attorney
general
had
the
lead
as
to
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
that
the
--
and
that
the
fact
of
registration
could
not
--
could
not
under
any
view
of
the
situation
provide
the
attorney
general
with
a
lead,
that
this
man
is
a
member
of
the
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
government
is
going
to
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
of
course,
that's
the
sixth
amendment
question,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
mean
if
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
our
position
on
that
point,
your
honor
is
that
--
that
the
board
having
determined
on
the
basis
of
competent
evidence
pursuant
to
this
regulatory
statute
that
the
person
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
there
being
in
the
statute
the
provision
for
judicial
review
that
that
finding
of
the
board
is
not
subject
to
challenge
for
a
later
prosecution
for
failure
to
obey
the
order
to
register.
now,
we've
cited
in
our
brief
the
cox
case,
the
(inaudible)
case
in
support
of
that
proposition.
we
feel
that
that
question
is
clearly
premature
because
it
has
not
been
construed
by
any
court.
there
has
not
been
a
criminal
prosecution
under
--
for
failure
to
register
as
an
individual
member
of
the
communist
party.
conceivably,
the
trial
court
would
require
the
government
to
prove
independent
of
the
board's
finding
that
the
individual
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
on
a
particular
date.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
correct,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
statute
only
has
that
effect
but
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
the
statute
which
--
the
statute
requires
a
hearing
before
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
statute
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
we're
saying
it
could
not
be
a
lead
because
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
that's
to
look
--
that's
looking
for
leads.
that's
a
lead
to
look
for
something.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
it
does
because
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
because
of
the
provision
in
the
--
the
other
provision
in
the
statute
that
the
attorney
general
in
order
to
get
an
order
to
compel
disclosure
--
to
compel
registration
has
to
demonstrate
that
he
already
have
evidence
(voice
overlap)
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
we
rely
on
counselman,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
bsolutely,
your
honor.
we
say
this
case
is
out
of
the
counselman
doctrine
because
of
the
--
of
the
additional
factor
–-
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no
sir,
i'm
not
contending
to
that
doctrine
at
all.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
all
i'm
saying
(voice
overlap).
well,
let
me
add
this,
your
honor.
we
make
this
contention
with
respect
to
the
counselman
case
and
the
added
--
added
factor
of
the
hearing
which
demonstrates
that
it
couldn't
be
a
lead
only
in
connection
with
the
registration
itself,
the
registration
form
itself.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
he's
a
member
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
before,
your
honor,
he's
not
admitting
he's
guilty
of
any
offense.
he's
--
at
the
most
he's
admitting
is
that
he's
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
it
certainly
is
not
crime
in
and
of
itself
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
this
court
has
held
at
--
just
a
couple
of
years
ago
in
the
scales
case.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it's'
a
lead
and
it
could
be
a
link
of
course.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
in
the
smith
act
case,
your
honor?
well,
that's
true.
it's
part
of
that
the
smith
act
case
and
certainly
a
link,
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
correct.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
in
the
circumstances
of
the
blau
case
and
in
normal
circumstances.
i
quite
agree.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
i
think
it's
an
unusual
factual
situation
which
prohibits
a
proper
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
there
isn't
any
danger
to
the
registrant
in
effecting
his
registration.
and
if
he's
not
in
any
danger
of
incriminating
himself,
he
has
no
proper
fifth
amendment
privilege.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
for
disclosure.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
no,
congress
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
congress
required
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
for
a
registra
--
a
central
register
of
members
of
the
communist
party
so
that
the
public
would
be
aware
of
who
are
the
members
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
one
--
one
feature
of
--
of
that
argument
which
--
which
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
in
the
first
place,
this
would
permit
the
attorney
general
as
he
is
required
to
do
by
statute
to
establish
a
central
register,
a
public
register
of
members
of
the
communist
party.
the
attorney
general
could
of
course
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no
sir,
i
don't
think
he
can
do
it.
there's
no
statutory
provision
for
him
to
--
to
register
someone.
the
individual
is
required
to
register
himself
if
the
organization
which
has
the
primary
duty
of
registering.
if
the
organization
fails
to
include
the
member's
name
on
its
registration
statement,
the
statute
contemplates
that
the
organization
will
register.
and
it
requires
the
organization
to
list
its
officers
and
its
members.
and
it's
only
if
the
organization
fails
to
comply
with
its
duty
in
that
respect
that
the
--
that
the
responsibility
falls
on
the
individual
member.
but
even
then,
it
is
not
a
compellable
responsibility
or
duty
on
the
individual
member
because
the
statute
provides
for
this
intervening
board
proceeding
at
which
the
attorney
general
is
required
if
he
wants
to
get
an
order
against
the
individual
to
establish
that
the
individual
is
a
member
of
the
party.
then
the
board
issues
an
order
and
the
individual
then
is
required
to
register
himself
and
not
just
to
register.
he
is
also
required
under
the
statute
to
furnish
the
additional
information
which
appears
on
the
registration
statement.
the
congress
wanted
more
than
a
bare-naked
registration.
it
wanted
information
which
is
set
forth
in
section
7
which
the
organization
is
suppose
to
supply
with
respect
to
each
member
relating
to
aliases,
it
once
address
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
wanted
that
from
the
organization
primarily
but
from
the
individual
member
himself
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
identification
purposes,
disclosure
purposes
so
that
the
public
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
yes,
oh
yes.
and
we
of
course
recognized
the
distinction
that's
applicable
to
the
information
on
the
registration
form.
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
we
–
we
state
in
our
brief
that
we
agree
in
this
respect
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
fifth
amendment
claims
as
to
the
specific
questions
on
the
registration
form
as
distinguished
from
the
registration
statement
are
premature
claims.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
they're
premature
at
this
stage.
they
have
not
specifically
registered
a
fifth
amendment
claim
with
respect
to
each
individual
request
for
information.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
we
do
not
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
certainly
think
in
many
instances,
it
would
be
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
specific
request
here
for
example
with
respect
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
that
--
i
would
say
that
in
most
instances
it
would
be
acknowledged
as
a
--
as
a
proper
claim.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
there
had
been
no
claims
on
any
of
these
forms,
your
honor.
i
have
no
doubt
that
none
whatever
that
if
there
was
a
proper
fifth
amendment
claim
made
with
response
--
made
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
mean
a
claim
which
in
the
circumstances
makes
it
reasonable
to
conclude
that
there
is
some
danger
of
incrimination.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
with
respect
to
alias,
the
fifth
amendment
claim
would
--
with
respect
to
a
member
of
the
communist
party
would
probably
almost
on
its
face
would
be
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
like
to
prejudge
any
address
question
because
i
think
address
normally
is
not
incriminatory
but
it
certainly
can
be
in
certain
circumstances.
as
this
court
recognized
in
a
house
committee
contempt
case
a
few
years
ago
in
which
they
asked
the
address
of
--
i
think
it
was
simpson
and
i
think
another
defendant
named
wahl
and
invoked
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
and
the
--
and
they
were
subsequently
indicted
for
contempt
and
convicted.
the
solicitor
general
confessed
there
in
this
court,
and
this
court
agreed
that
in
the
circumstances
of
that
case,
the
answer
might
be
incriminatory
--
incriminatory
because
there
was
an
indication
for
example
that
the
committee
had
information
that
meetings,
communist
party
meetings
were
held
at
his
house
so
that
for
his
--
him
to
give
his
address
might
connect
him
with
those
communist
party
meetings.
so
that
i
--
aliases
with
respect
to
a
person
registering
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
i
think
it's
probably
fairly
clear
that
there
would
be
proper
fifth
amendment
claims.
address
might
vary
from
case
to
case,
circumstances
to
circumstances.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
we're
not
--
we're
not
contending,
your
honor,
in
this
case
for
the
--
for
the
general
proposition
that
the
government
can
with
--
or
can
deprive
someone
of
a
fifth
amendment
claim
by
making
some
kind
of
showing
--
ex
parte
showing
that
it
already
has
a
lead.
we're
saying
that
in
view
of
the
peculiar
circumstances
that
are
built
into
this
statute
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
has
to
be
this
preliminary
proceeding
before
the
board
relating
to
membership
in
the
communist
party.
and
since
the
registration,
the
registration
itself
as
distinguished
from
the
registration
statement,
since
that
is
confined
to
a
registration
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
a
communist-action
organization
that
in
those
special
peculiar
circumstances,
he
is
not
in
any
danger
of
incrimination
and
the
--
the
--
and
for
that
reason,
he
has
no
proper
fifth
amendment
claim.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
in
the
first
place,
your
honor
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
on
first
place,
your
honor,
we
of
course
concede
that
the
individual
at
the
time
of
filling
out
the
registration
statement
can,
if
he
is
fearful,
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
with
respect
to
any
question.
we're
not
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
as
i've
just
indicated
a
few
minutes
ago,
i
--
i
think
that
it
would
be
and
i
--
i
can
--
i
can
do
no
more
than
to
say
that
it
would
--
it
would
be
in
proper
circumstances,
i'm
confident
it
would
be.
and
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
no,
i
think
ultimately
they're
determined
by
the
courts.
if
he
invoked
the
claim
of
fifth
amendment
which
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
that's
right.
in
other
words,
it's
possible
that
he
would
make
a
fifth
amendment
claim
that
the
attorney
general
would
not
recognize
it
and
that
the
attorney
general
would
institute
a
proceeding
to
test
the
validity
of
the
fifth
amendment
claim.
then
the
court
would
have
to
decide
as
it
always
does.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
i
don't
know
of
any
other,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
i
think
its
five
years
for
the
registration
statement.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
for
the
registration
itself
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
it's
five
years
for
each
everyday.
everyday
is
a
separate
test.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
other
one
is
only
one
offense,
it's
a
five-year
offense.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
so
that
the
cumulative
penalty
that
they
contend
threatens
them,
we
say
is
--
is
something
that
the
--
the
court
properly
should
decide
now
with
respect
to
the
fifth
amendment
claim.
we
say
that
the
--
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
properly
invoked
in
the
circumstances
of
the
registration
statement.
and
of
course,
it's
our
position
that
the
court
should
sustain
the
order
with
respect
to
the
filing
of
the
registration
itself
and
of
course
also
as
to
the
registration
form
and
leave
for
later
determination
any
claims
of
fifth
amendment
which
may
be
made
by
a
particular
registrant
in
connection
with
particular
questions
set
forth
on
the
registration
form.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
will
--
we
will
submit
a
supplemental
memorandum
on
the
point,
your
honor.
i
think
murphy
v.
waterfront
commission
is
--
is
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
yes,
yes
sir
we
--
we
consider
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
not
the
precise
question
as
to
any
--
any
situation
in
which
the
government
made
the
contention
that
the
situation
was
brought
out
of
a
rule
of
counselman
because
there
couldn't
be
a
lead.
we
--
that
is
a
contention
made
because
of
a
noble
circumstances
created
by
the
statute.
we
say
--
we
say
this
is
a
noble
situation.
but
at
the
same
time
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
thoroughly
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
i
don't
think
there
are
any.
i
think
counselman
is
still
a
good
law.
i
think
this
court
is
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
can
i
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
i
think
--
i
think
murphy
indicates
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no
sir,
no
sir.
i
think
murphy
implemented
counselman
and
we
say
counselman
can
be
implemented
in
these
circumstances.
if
all
we
had
was
section
4
(f),
we
would
agree.
counselman
would
preclude
on
making
this
argument.
but
in
view
of
the
statutory
requirement
of
a
board
proceeding
which
demonstrates
or
in
this
record,
in
this
case,
on
the
basis
of
evidence
produced
before
the
administrative
tribunal
that
there
could
not
be
provided
to
the
attorney
general
a
lead.
and
i
think
that's
a
very
unusual
factual
situation
but
i
think
that
in
the
unique
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
court
should
so
hold.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
you
mean
just
section
4
(f)
and
nothing
else?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
as
i
--
as
i
understand
the
question,
i
gather
that's
pretty
much
the
counselman
situation.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
counselman
said
that
the
statute
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
what
were
the
reasons?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
counselman
was
based
on
the
fact
that
the
immunity
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
the
statute
was
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
of
course
the
counselman
statute
didn't
state
any
reasons
either.
it
just
said
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
we're
saying
the
court
said,
now
the
court
in
counselman
said
that
the
statute
there
was
not
sufficiently
broad
because
although
it
prohibited
use
of
the
evidence
in
a
criminal
case
against
the
person,
it
did
not
foreclose
the
--
the
prosecutor
from
securing
from
that
evidence
leads
to
other
evidence
which
he
might
then
be
able
to
use.
and
we
say
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
not
as
far
as
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
--
absolutely!
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
as
far
as
the
registration
statement
itself
is
concerned,
we
say
that
is
correct
because
the
attorney
general
on
this
record
demonstrated
that
he
knew
that
the
person
was
a
member
of
the
party
and
he
had
evidence
to
show
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
of
course
it
isn't
wholly
irrelevant.
as
this
court
held
just
four
years
ago
in
the
communist
party
case
that
when
you're
dealing
with
this
kind
of
an
organization,
that
when
you're
considering
the
magnitude
of
the
governmental
interest
and
the
desirability
to
the
--
the
public
benefit
of
removing
the
mask
of
anonymity
as
far
as
members
of
the
communist
party
is
concerned,
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
prohibit
the
registration
that
is
required
under
the
statute
and
the
information
which
is
required
to
be
furnished
in
connection
with
that
registration.
the
court
could
in
the
communist
party
case
distinguished
bryant
v.
zimmerman
which
was
a
statute
aimed
at
the
ku
klux
klan
and
it
held
that
because
of
the
nature
of
the
organization
and
the
danger
to
society
that
it
represented,
that
the
klan
and
organizations
of
--
of
that
character
could
be
regulated
by
registration
statutes.
and
so
i
--
i
don't
think
that
the
registration
that
it
was
required
here
by
congress
that
the
disclosure
that
was
contemplated
by
congress
serves
no
useful
purpose
and
serves
a
very
definite
purpose
of
disclosing
the
identities
of
members
of
an
organization
which
is
far
and
directed
and
controlled,
and
which
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
an
advantage.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
it
may
--
it
may
be
somewhat
to
their
disadvantage
but
in
the
--
in
the
balancing
test
which
the
court
applies
in
the
first
case,
the
--
the
disadvantage
to
the
individual
were
(voice
overlap)
by
the
governmental
(voice

mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
wanted
to
take
a
minute
or
two
to
indicate
to
the
court
an
alternative
argument
under
the
fifth
amendment
question
which
we
advanced
in
our
brief.
that
is
that
when
an
individual
comes
in
and
responds
to
an
order
of
the
board
requiring
him
to
register
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
he
submits
the
registration
--
registration
itself
as
distinguished
again
from
the
form
that
he's
really
not
making
any
admission
at
all,
let
alone
an
incriminatory
admission.
he
--
he's
in
a
similar
position
to
one
who
is
under
subpoena
required
to
come
in
and
to
testify.
the
fact
that
he
might
be
in
a
position
to
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
on
individual
questions
which
would
be
asked
during
the
course
of
this
testimony,
does
not
permit
him
to
make
the
threshold
argument
that
the
fifth
amendment
protects
him
from
coming
in
at
all.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
of
course
sometimes
that's
true
with
respect
to
other
forms
that
are
required
to
be
filed,
for
example,
income
tax
forms.
and
as
this
court
held
in
the
sullivan
case
that
the
fact
of
certain
information
required
should
be
stated
on
your
income
tax
form
might
be
incriminatory
and
concerning
which
you
might
be
able
to
invoke
the
proper
fifth
amendment
claim
then
it
did
not
permit
you
to
take
the
position
that
you
would
file
no
return
at
all.
and
as
i
think
it
was
justice
holmes'
decision
in
sullivan
held
that
he
had
to
file
a
form.
when
he
does
file
it,
maybe
he
can
invoke
the
fifth
amendment
with
respect
to
particular
inquiries
and
of
course,
that's
just
the
situation
here.
and
also
because
of
the
existence
of
the
board
proceeding,
the
fact
that
he
has
been
singled
out
by
the
attorney
general
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
takes
the
case
out
of
what,
i
believe
justice
black
referred
to
in
the
kahriger
case
as
a
squeezing
device.
we
don't
have
a
situation
such
as
we
had
in
the
gambling
tax
statute
where
the
individual,
on
his
own
initiative,
is
required
under
criminal
penalty
to
come
forward
and
identify
himself
as
one
engaged
in
a
particular
activity
which
might
be
criminal.
here,
he's
already
been
singled
out
as
a
member
of
a
class.
the
--
additionally,
the
form,
the
registration
statement
or
registration
form
rather,
as
it
presently
is
made
by
order
or
by
a
regulation
of
the
attorney
general
require
simply
that
the
person
state
his
name
and
that
he
is
registering
as
a
member
of
a
--
of
blank,
the
communist
party
in
this
instance,
a
communist-action
organization.
there's
nothing
on
the
form
to
preclude
his
making
a
statement
that
he's
doing
so
only
because
of
the
existence
of
a
board
order
against
him
or
that
he
disagrees
thoroughly
with
the
conclusions
of
the
board
order.
certainly,
he
can
indicate
on
the
form,
“i,
hereby,
register
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party
though
i
disagree
with
all
the
factual
conclusions
of
the
board.”
he's
not
precluded
from
doing
that.
and
we
think
in
no
circumstances
that
insofar
as
a
registration
itself,
the
bare
act
of
registration,
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
protect
him
from
complying
with
the
board
order.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
for
just
a
moment
to
a
question
that
justice
fortas
asked
me
earlier
in
the
argument
with
respect
to
an
offer
of
proof
on
our
part
before
the
board
as
to
a
change
in
the
character
of
a
communist
party.
as
i've
said
before,
we
made
no
such
offer.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
justice
fortas,
under
the
court's
decision
in
the
party
case,
at
least
insofar
as
the
existence
of
a
world
communist
movement
under
the
domination
and
control
of
the
soviet
union
is
concerned,
that
is
not
a
matter
of
evidence.
the
court
in
the
party
case
held
that
that
was
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
which
would
be
resolved
on
--
on
a
matter
of
judicial
notice.
and
as
i
said
in
my
argument,
the
board
not
having
taken
judicial
notice
of
these
--
but
everybody
knows
of
the
--
of
the
new
circumstances,
the
absence
of
any
kind
of
a
--
of
monolithic
world
communist
movement,
the
obvious
absence
of
soviet
domination
and
the
control
of
--
of
such
a
movement.
since
the
board
refuse
to
take
judicial
notice
of
those
--
of
that
change
in
circumstances,
it's
our
position
and
we
rely
on
the
party
case
itself
in
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
that
question
is
always
open
to
review.
it's
our
position
that
the
court
must
take
judicial
notice.
this
court
must
take
judicial
notice
of
that
change.
and
we
cite
some
of
the
authorities
which
such
judicial
notice
could
be
based
in
our
brief.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he
said
both
things.
he
say
that
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
erroneous
exclusion
of
an
offered
line
of
proof
but
there
was
a
ruling
by
the
board
that
we
were
precluded
by
--
by
1953
finding.
and
that
preclusion
operates
in
two
respects.
first,
we
were
precluded
from
offering
evidence
to
show
that
the
communist
party
was
not
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
soviet
union.
second,
we
were
precluded
from
asking
the
court
or
the
board
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
there
was
--
there
is
no
longer
a
world
communist
or
is
in
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
words
that
the
world
communist
movement
as
defined
in
section
2
no
longer
exists.
now,
on
the
--
on
the
privilege
question,
mr.
maroney
has
argued
that
--
that
these
are
very
noble
and
the
peculiar
circumstances
that
were
confronted
with
here
under
the
statute
because
of
the
requirement
of
a
board
of
evidence
and
the
board
finding
before
the
admission
is
compelled,
the
circumstances
are
neither
so
noble
nor
so
peculiar
as
mr.
maroney
would
have
it
appear.
for
example,
in
every
proceeding
now
before
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities,
in
order
to
satisfy
this
court's
decision
on
requiring
and
showing
of
pertinency,
the
committee
first
calls
a
whole
series
of
so-called
friendly
witnesses
who
would
testify
that
x,
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
then
they
call
x
and
they
say,
“we
have
evidence
before
us
and
we
found
that
you're
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
now,
mr.
x,
tell
us,
are
you
or
were
you
ever
or
are
you
now
a
member
of
the
communist
party?”
under
mr.
maroney's
argument,
this
claim
of
privilege
wouldn't
all
--
would
be
overruled.
similarly,
before
a
grand
jury,
if
a
statute
of
the
counselman
type
or
applicable
to
some
kind
of
a
proceeding
before
the
grand
jury,
prosecutor
is
accustomed
at
first
call,
all
of
the
prosecuting
witnesses
who
would
identify
the
accused
as
a
person
who
commits
a
--
has
committed
a
crime.
the
grand
jury
transcript
which
show
all
these
evidence,
then
they'd
call
the
accused
and
say,
“are
you
--
are
you
the
fellow
that
--
that
did
this
thing?”
and
if
the
man
has
searched
his
privilege,
they
take
him
before
the
judge
and
they
say,
“here
judge,
here's
the
transcript
of
his
--
of
our
grand
jury
proceeding.
look
at
this
mountain
of
evidence
we
have
that
the
man
is
guilty.
obviously,
he
has
no
privilege
under
those
circumstances.”
that's
mr.
maroney's
argument.
beyond
that,
i
think,
it
should
be
bore
in
mind
that
--
that
this
isn't
a
taste
like
counselman
that
concerned
some
commercial
transaction,
a
grain
merchant
who
was
receiving
illegal
railroad
rebates.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
claim
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
raised
in
the
context
of
a
prosecution
for
political
affiliation
and
belief.
the
case
in
which
the
fifth
amendment
has
its
historic
and
traditional
relationship
to
--
to
first
amendment
rights
and
it's
in
that
context
that
the
claim
of
privilege
has
been
made.
now,
mr.
maroney,
as
in
the
government's
brief,
keeps
on
repeating
the
fact
that
the
decision
in
the
party
case
is
controlling
here
on
the
issue
of
the
first
amendment
because
in
the
party
case,
it
was
held
that
congress
has
the
--
the
right
to
require
disclosure
and
stripped
the
mask
of
anonymity
from
the
communist
party.
but
the
government
ignores
and
continues
to
ignore
and
will
never
recognize
is
that
whatever
justification
this
removal
of
the
so-called
mask
of
anonymity
might
give
to
the
provisions
for
a
registration
by
the
organization,
it
can't
excuse
the
requirement
of
self-registration
because
the
mask
of
anonymity
has
been
stripped;
disclosure
has
been
made
by
the
finding
of
the
board
itself.
and
in
first
amendment
terms,
this
case
is
just
like
the
barnette
case,
the
flag
salute
case.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
government
has
got
the
right
to
compel
a
man
to
come
forward
and
avow,
not
only
to
avow
his
political
association
but
against
his
conscience
and
belief
to
declare
that
the
organization
of
which
he
is
associated
is
a
criminal
conspiracy.
in
mr.
justice
jackson
in
the
barnette
case
said
that
you
couldn't
compel
a
person
by
sign
or
symbols
to
indicate
his
acquiescence
in
the
political
ideas
that
flag
salute
speaks.
so
we
say
here,
the
first
amendment
again
stands
as
a
bar
to
compelling
persons
by
registration,
by
the
sign
and
symbol
of
registration
to
indicate
their
acquiescence
in
the
political
beliefs
that
the
mccarran
act
speaks,
this
internal
security
act.
and
the
best
evidence
of
the
fact
that
--
that
this
is
a
requirement
--
much
as
requirement
and
the
requirement
that
invades
a
conscience
and
belief
of
the
person
who's
compelled
to
make
such
a
sign
and
symbol
is
a
fact
that
in
all
these
years
and
under
the
threat
of
all
these
penalties,
not
a
single
person
has
yet
registered
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party
with
the
attorney
general
under
this
act.
thank
you
very
much.
