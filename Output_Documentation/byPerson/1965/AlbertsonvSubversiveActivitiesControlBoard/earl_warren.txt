board.
mr.
abt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he
just
filed
the
registration
certificate
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
does
not
file
a
statement,
does
he
satisfy
the
registration
part
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
would
no
longer
be
--
be
guilty
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
cumulative
penalties.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
and
the
government
disagree
on
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
maroney.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
an
argument
sustained
by
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
may
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
may
i
just
interrupt
just
a
moment.
there
you
said
that
that
it's
clear
that
the
congress
said
they
shall
not
use
this
information
in
any
other
criminal
prosecution.
what
language
you
rely
on
there
for
that
statement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
--
i'm
just
asking
what
language
of
the
act
you
rely
on
to
sustain
that
position.
i
don't
want
to
argue
with
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
4
(f),
what
does
it
say
in
that
regard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
say
that
the
fruits
of
this
statement
shall
not
be
use
by
the
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
--
isn't
it
customary
for
congress
when
it
wants
to
give
immunity
of
the
kind
that
you
now
mentioned
to
say
that
they
shall
not
be
prosecuted
for
any
matter
concerning
which
they
have
testified?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
your
position
then
that
in
any
future
prosecution
that
the
government
may
use,
this
registration
certificate
and
the
statement
of
the
attorney
general
in
anyway
that
it
wants
to
--
to
--
to
get
information
concerning
the
guilt
of
this
party
and
use
it
on
the
trial
against
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
all
--
all
the
section
says
is
that
--
that
the
certificates
shall
not
be
received
in
evidence.
isn't
there
a
difference
between
not
receiving
this
--
the
registration
certificate
in
evidence
from
--
from
using
any
information
that
the
government
gets
from
that
registration?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
every
man
who
is
registered
is
--
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
united
states
government
has
not
in
any
way
use
his
--
his
registration
certificate
in
order
to
obtain
evidence
against
him
on
his
trial.
is
that
burden
on
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
is
the
burden
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
talking
about
what
he's
compelled
to
do
under
this
action
--
under
this
statute
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
you're
viewing
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
voluntary
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
is
compelled
under
--
under
penalty
of
going
to
penitentiary
for
five
years
for
each
day
that
he
doesn't
register?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
we
sustain
you,
isn't
that
automatic
that
the
board
will
make
that
order?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
that
be
evident?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
that
be
evident?
you
said
that
it's
perfectly
evident.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
mean
that
--
that
no
attorney
general
could
ever
be
wrong
about
that
or
no
attorney
general
could
ever
do
it
with
the
--
with
an
interest
involved
in
it
other
than
to
seek
the
truth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
the
government
of
the
state
concerning
that
--
we
knew
what
his
aliases
were
just
as
we
knew
he
was
a
communist.
we
got
no
lead
from
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
knew
that
before.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
just
wondering
what
will
happen
if
--
if
a
man
does
register
and
list
some
aliases
that
he
used
and
the
government
comes
into
court
when
they
prosecute
him
to
show
that
--
that
he
did
used
those
aliases
and
what
he
did
under
those
aliases.
and
it
says,
“oh
we
knew
all
about
this
beforehand,
before
he
registered.
we
knew
what
his
aliases
were.
and
we
knew
that
he
had
been
engaged
in
this
activity.
we
didn't
learn
anything
from
--
from
his
statement
or
his
registration
certificate.”
now,
how
is
a
man
--
how
is
a
man
to
defend
against
that
kind
of
a
situation?
how
does
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
how
can
he
prove
that
--
that
the
government
did
get
those
leads
from
--
from
what
he
said
and
did
--
did
obtain
all
their
evidence
to
that
effect
from
what
--
what
he
said
in
his
statement
and
registration
certificate.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
for
each
additional
day,
it's
five
years,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
didn't
look
into
that
matter
in
appraising
the
effect
of
counselman
versus
hitchcock
in
this
case.
the
question
was
the
fact
of
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
cover
it
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
question
that
he
just
asked.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
maroney,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
don't
make
him
--
you
don't
make
the
person
under
subpoena
give
the
answers
to
the
questions
that
the
government
wants
before
he
gets
in
the
court.
here,
you
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
abt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you're
not
arguing
then
that
there
was
an
erroneous
exclusion
of
the
line
of
proof.
what
you're
saying
is
that
judicial
notice
ought
to
be
taken
in
something
that
you'd
say
is
a
fact.
