justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
commission
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
the
commission
in
that
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
tell
me.
under
17
(9)
would
you
--
would
it
be
different?
which
you
have
decided
on
the
record
--
i
mean,
that
proceeding
would
be
a
proceeding
under
record
below?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
i
don't
understand
mr.
mcdonald.
what
--
what
i
understood
you
to
say
was
that
in
that
deere
case,
a
16
(2)
proceeding
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
â€“
you
are
limited
to
review
on
the
record
made
before
the
commission.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
well,
what
you
say
that
the
determination
was
made
on
record
before
the
commission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
is
how
i
think
you
are
worse
than
you'd
be
in
the
17
(9)
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
happen
--
i
gather,
your
position
is
in
the
16
(2)
of
all
the
things
you
have
told
us
could
be
asserted
in
17
(9)
or
1336
proceedings,
would
also
be
asserted
by
way
of
defense
in
16
(2).
if
you
prevail
under
16
(2)
proceeding,
the
shipper
does
not
get
an
order
against
the
railroad
to
pay
the
reparation,
but
the
order
of
the
commission
itself
remains
to
the
books.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
--
well,
now
what
--
what
value
is
an
order
treated
that
way
of
a
16
(2)
proceeding,
even
though
it's
still
on
the
books,
what
value
is
it
to
any
other
shipper?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
the
finding
of
the
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
has
the
facts
in
any
experience.
it
was
16
(2)
proceedings
where
reparations
were
not
ordered
at
the
conclusion
of
the
proceeding
where
nevertheless
the
icc
order
has
been
relied
on
in
another
instance.
is
there
any
experience
to
that?
