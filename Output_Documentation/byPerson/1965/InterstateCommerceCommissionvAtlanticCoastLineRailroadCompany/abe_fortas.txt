justice
abe
fortas
mr.
ginnane,
as
i
understand
that
and
i
may
be
wrong
about
this.
what
happens
on
the
shipper
suit
is
that
the
findings
and
order
of
the
commission
are
offered
as
prima
facie
evidence
then
the
shipper
further
if
he
wanted
to
supplement
that
evidence,
that
is
to
say
that
commission's
findings
and
order
and
carrier
can
introduce
evidence
to
show
that
despite
their
prim
--
prima
facie
--
the
findings
in
order
are
incorrect,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
ordinarily,
the
knowledge
â€“
it
occurs
to
me
as
antitrust
claim
in
a
--
findings
in
order
in
any
antitrust
action
brought
by
the
government.
and
when
that
is
used
as
prima
facie
evidence
in
a
private
suit
then
the
procedure
--
i
believe
is
as
i
have
described
it,
but
you're
telling
me
that
as
practical
matters,
it's
different
here?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
but
as
a
matter
of
law
is
it
--
is
it
your
view
that
under
this
statute,
the
carrier
could
come
in
and
introduce
evidence
in
a
usual
way
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
similarly,
the
shipper
could
come
in
and
introduce
supplementary
evidence?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
to
--
to
whatever
purpose
he
choose
to
reinforced
to
strengthen
the
case
made
to
reinforce
or
supplement
the
prima
facie
case.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
ginnane,
here
you're
presenting
this
as
i
understand
your
theory
that
16
(2)
provides
an
adequate
method
of
review
of
the
commission
order?
justice
abe
fortas
we
decide
--
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
studied
this,
it
seems
i
--
i
perhaps
was
misled
by
my
own
study
of
this
thing,
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
commission,
in
one
point
of
view
maybe
functioning
here
as
nothing
more
than
sort
of
a
master
to
make
a
findings
and
conclusions
that
are
not
self-executing
and
then
if
that
is
so
then
you
wouldn't
--
might
consider
whether
the
absence
of
judicial
review
is
legal.
if
your
concern
is
nothing
more
than
finding
of
master
in
subsequent
proceedings
are
--
in
the
hands
of
interested
[inaudible]
and
that
was
my
understanding
of
this,
but
i
take
it
that
you
would
reject
that
in
the
absence
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
perhaps
i
can
state
my
difficulty
this
way.
if
you
assume
that
the
type
of
order
that
the
commission
enters
in
a
reparations
case
is
an
order
which
requires
judicial
review
then
i
--
it
made
me
that
there's
problem
here
which
is
of
considerable
difficulty.
is
that
your
assumption
that
as
a
matter
of
law
a
commission's
reparation
order
requires
judicial
review
machinery?
justice
abe
fortas
i
didn't
want
to
ask
you
but
i
get
you.
that
is
--
it
was
not
my
question.
i
said
a
review
of
that
order
as
distinguished
from
a
--
an
independent
proceeding
in
which
the
commission's
findings
and
orders
are
merely
part
of
the
mass
of
evidentiary
material.
that
is
--
you
can
have
a
court
arriving
at
a
result
in
theory
at
any
rate
that
is
opposite
or
contrary
to
the
result
that
the
commission
arrived
at,
but
the
court's
contrary
decision
being
based
upon
evidence
before
it,
which
is
not
before
the
commission,
is
that
correct
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
does
it
appear
in
the
statute
mr.
mcdonald?
justice
abe
fortas
does
that
distinction
appeared
with
the
statute
in
any
way
or
what's
the
basis
of
that?
justice
abe
fortas
you
are
saying
that
there
are
decisions
of
this
court
that
support
the
propositions
that
you
just
stated?
justice
abe
fortas
and
not
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
nothing
in
the
section
16
(2)
that
would
indicate
that
difference
there,
is
there?
