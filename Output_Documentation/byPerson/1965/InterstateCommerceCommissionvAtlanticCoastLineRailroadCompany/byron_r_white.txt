justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
ginnane,
why
--
you
would
rather
stay
out
of
what
you
call
review
proceedings
of
your
decisions
which
underlie
reparation
order,
you
prefer
to
stay
out
of
those
of
the
16
(2)
suits
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
this
time
left
the
court
pass
on
your
--
on
the
commission's
judgments
which
might
involved
matters
of
some
import,
only
a
fact
that
how
much
the
dollars
and
cents
of
reparation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
courts
pass
on
that
without
being
there
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
didn't
--
again,
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
answer
is
yes
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
rather
stay
out
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
ever?
justice
byron
r.
white
although,
the
shipper
--
the
shipper
can
--
that
the
carrier
has
not
way
of
getting
you
in
the
court
to
--
for
purposes
of
judicial
review
one
of
the
reparation
orders
according
to
your
view.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
--
he
cannot
finally
have
any
carrier
under
16
(2)
proceeding
sets
your
order
aside,
the
railroad
--
the
railroad
cannot
have
your
order
set
aside.
all
--
all
the
court
can
do
is
say
that
the
shipper
or
this
railroad
doesn't
need
pay
this
particular
shipper.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
tried
this
on
the
record
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
second
circuit
case,
how
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
how
about
--
how
about
have
it
presently
that's
--
that
they
accept
the
rule
that's
the
understanding?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
gather
that
this
was
a
--
this
ruling
was
it
the
response
of
the
--
this
represents
the
commission
review
clearly.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
guess
if
you
are
going
to
17
--
under
17
(9)
railroad
--
again,
instead
of
being
put
off
the
16
(2),
you
wouldn't
have
choice
--
the
railroad
will
have
a
choice
of
venue
that
would
enjoin
16
(2)
and
it
wouldn't
have
to
pay
any
attorney's
fees.
