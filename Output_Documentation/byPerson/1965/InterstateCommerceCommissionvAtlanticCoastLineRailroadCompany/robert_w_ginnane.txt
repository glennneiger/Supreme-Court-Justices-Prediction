mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
began
with
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
did
only
one
thing.
it
ordered
the
respondent
railroads,
pay
reparations
of
about
$8900
to
a
shipper,
thomson
phosphate
company,
based
upon
shipments
of
ground
phosphate
rock
from
florida
points
at
--
in
illinois.
this
court
granted
the
commission's
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
respondent
railroads
could
bring
suit,
seeking
review
of
the
commission's
reparation
order
under
the
statutory
provisions
governing
the
review
of
commission
orders
generally.
we
contend
that
contrary
to
the
court
below
that
the
railroads
may
not
bring
suit
to
challenge
a
commission
order
awarding
reparation,
but
that
they
may
attack
that
order
only
by
way
of
defense
to
the
commi
--
to
the
shipper's
suit
seeking
to
enforce
the
reparation
order
under
the
provisions
of
section
16,
paragraph
2
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
we
contend
that
only
in
this
way
can
there
be
effectuated
two
congressional
purposes.
first,
to
leave
to
the
shippers
rather
than
to
the
government,
the
enforcement
of
reparation
orders
and
secondly,
to
accord
to
the
shippers'
specific
procedural
rights
as
to
venue
cost
and
attorney's
fees
which
will
enable
shippers
to
assume
that
work.
the
railroad
brought
this
suit
in
1961
in
the
united
states'
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
florida,
naming
united
states
and
the
commission
as
defendants.
the
shipper
was
not
named
as
a
defendant
and
has
not
intervened.
the
railroads
brought
this
suit
in
florida
in
reliance
upon
three
statutory
provisions.
the
first
was
section
17,
paragraph
9
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
3.
we
submit
that
on
its
face,
17
(9)
is
simply
a
requirement
for
the
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
the
railroad
contend
that
17
(9)
refers
us
to
the
judicial
code,
section
1336,
that's
in
our
brief
at
page
2,
which
provides
that
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
act
of
congress,
the
district
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
of
any
civil
action
to
enforce,
enjoin,
set
aside
any
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
railroad
further
point
to
the
venue
provision
1398
of
the
judicial
code,
which
provides
that
such
an
action
shall
be
brought
only
in
the
judicial
district
wherein
is
the
residence
or
office
of
plaintiff
or
one
of
the
plaintiffs.
so
the
railroad
contended
in
this
case
that
under
section
1336,
they
could
bring
their
own
direct
action
in
the
district
court
for
review
of
the
commission's
reparation
order
and
that
under
the
general
venue
provision
of
1398,
they
could
bring
it
in
jacksonville,
florida
where
the
atlantic
coast
line,
a
respondent
here
and
a
plaintiff
below,
has
its
principle
place
of
business.
now,
we
admit
that
1336
and
1398
of
the
judicial
code,
provide
for
the
judicial
review
of
the
general
wrong
of
icc
orders.
however,
we
contend
that
they
are
--
those
two
sections
are
rendered
inapplicable
by
the
specific
provisions
of
section
16,
paragraph
2
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
to
what
shall
happen
when
the
commission
directs
railroads
to
pay
reparations
to
a
shipper.
before
getting
into
the
heart
of
the
problem,
i
can
refer
briefly
to
the
prior
court
decisions
on
this
point.
this
court
has
never
given
plenary
consideration
to
the
point.
in
1911,
in
southern
railway
company
v.
united
states,
the
former
commerce
court
of
united
states
held
on
a
literal
reading
of
its
jurisdiction
to
review
any
order
of
the
commission
that
it
could
entertain
such
a
suit
by
a
railroad
at
attacking
a
reparation
order.
that
case
has
not
been
cited
since
1911.
later
in
1924,
a
three-judge
district
court
and
in
1937
the
third
circuit,
have
held
that
a
railroad
may
not
maintain
such
a
direct
suit.
i
might
also
say
that
a
mere
glance
at
the
annotations
to
section
16
(2)
of
the
annotation
code,
shows
that
there
are
large
number
of
cases
in
which
the
courts
have
look
up
reparation
orders
in
the
context
of
a
suit
brought
by
the
shipper
under
16
(2).
for
50
years,
except
for
three
--
of
three
cases
in
which
i
have
mentioned
before
and
this
case,
for
50
years,
the
courts
have
reviewed
reparation
orders
in
the
context
of
a
suit
brought
by
the
shipper.
before
going
into
the
details
of
section
16
(2),
i
think
it
may
be
useful
to
point
out
the
court
the
status
of
a
reparation
order
issued
by
the
commission
as
compared
to
the
other
types
of
orders,
many
other
types
of
orders
which
the
commission
issues.
since
the
hepburn
amendments
of
1906,
with
the
exception
of
orders
for
the
payment
of
money,
the
commission's
orders
are
self-executing,
self-operating,
in
that
they
must
be
obeyed
subject
to
penalty
unless
a
court
sets
them
aside.
and
it
was
--
in
making
orders
–
such
orders
other
than
for
the
payment
of
money,
self-operative
for
the
first
time
in
1906
that
congress
for
the
first
time
provided
for
direct
review
of
commission
orders.
in
addition,
if
a
railroad
fails
to
obey
any
order
of
the
commission
other
than
for
the
payment
of
money,
the
commission
or
any
party
injured
may
go
into
court
and
seek
affirmative
enforcement.
in
contrast,
when
the
commission
orders
a
railroad
to
pay
reparations
to
a
shipper,
that
is
an
order
for
the
payment
of
money,
that
order
is
not
self-operative.
by
that
i
mean,
that
if
the
railroad
is
unwilling
to
comply
and
pay,
nothing
happens.
it
is
not
subject
to
any
penalty.
moreover,
the
commission
is
not
empowered
to
go
into
court
to
enforce
a
reparation
order.
rather
section
16
(2)
has
its
own
specific
machinery.
it's
set
forth
in
pages
4
and
5
of
our
brief
and
it
provides
that
the
complainant,
that
is
the
shipper,
may
file
in
the
district
court
of
united
states
for
the
district
in
which
he
resides,
on
which
is
located
the
railroad's
office
or
through
which
the
railroad
operates
or
in
any
state
court
which
has
jurisdiction
of
the
railroad,
a
complaint.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
016
(2)
--
16
(2)
by
ninety
years–-
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
16
(2)
in
one
form
or
another
has
been
in
the
act
since
1887,
in
substantially
its
present
form
that
has
been
there
since
1906.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
is
part
of
the
transportation
act
of
1940.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
1940.
such
a
suit
in
the
district
court
section
16
(2)
says,
"shall
proceed
in
all
respects
like
other
civil
suits
for
damages,”
except
that
the
findings
and
order
of
the
commission,
“shall
be
prima
facie
evidence
of
the
facts
therein
stated”
and
except
that
the
plaintiff
shall
not
be
liable
for
costs
except
those
which
accrue
on
his
own
appeal
and
the
plaintiff
if
he
finally
prevails,
shall
be
allowed
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
to
be
taxed
and
collected
as
part
of
a
cost
of
suit.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
a
practical
matter
search
through
the
years,
no.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
what
happen
--
what
has
happened
in
the
judicial
application
of
these
provisions
is
that
the
review
is
just
the
same
as
in
a
direct
review
procedure.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
statute
was
phrased
this
way
because
it
was
thought
necessary
to
preserve
the
carriers'
right
to
trial
by
jury,
the
money
claim.
as
a
practical
matter
that
they
do
not
often
ask
of
a
trial
by
jury.
the
result
is
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
a
few
years
ago
held
in
a
new
a
process
deere
case
that
the
standards
are
the
same
as
an
ordinary
judicial
review.
are
the
commission's
findings
supported
by
substantial
evidence?
are
they
in
accordance
with
the
statute
and
were
they
made
after
a
fair
procedure?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
this
court
has
not
had
occasion
to.
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
under
section
16
(2)
it
finds
that
the
carrier
has
a
full
opportunity
to
defend
against
the
commission's
order
on
any
ground
that
would
be
available
on
a
direct
review
proceeding.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
could
happen.
i
don't
know
of
such
a
case.
i
put
it
this
way.
the
court
could
do
it,
however,
whether
the
shipper
would
have
a
right
to
a
trial
by
trial
in
that
situation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
let
me
go
back
sir,
i
think
i
misled
you.
if
the
shipper
is
attacking
the
commission's
order
as
not
giving
him
enough
then
he
does
not
proceed
under
16
(2)
to
enforce
the
order.
he
would
file
–
he
would
find
action
on
the
1336,
challenging
the
commission's
order.
the
commission
erred
as
a
matter
of
law
or
as
a
matter
of
clear
evidentiary
record
in
--
and
not
awarding
him
more.
there
had
been
such
suits
filed
in
recent
years.
section
16
(6)
--
section
16
(2)
is
invoked
by
a
shipper
in
a
suit
against
the
carrier
not
in
a
suit
against
--
against
the
commission
seeking
to
attack
commission's
order.
we
think
section
16
(2)
has
four
salient
features.
the
first
it
provides
that
the
commission
order
awarding
reparations
shall
be
enforced
by
the
shipper
not
by
commission.
it
gives
the
shipper
a
choice
of
venue,
including
most
importantly
the
district
in
which
he
resides.
it
largely
freezes
the
shipper
from
a
liability
for
a
costs
and
finally,
it
allows
the
shipper
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
if
he
prevails.
we
believe
this
whole
procedure,
careful
procedural
pattern
of
16
(2)
were
before
him,
if
it's
the
court
below
held
the
carrier
instead
of
waiting
for
the
shipper's
suit
which
must
be
brought
within
a
year,
instead
of
winning
for
the
shipper's
suit,
it
instituted
its
own
direct
review
proceeding
in
a
suit
brought
against
the
united
states
and
the
commission.
in
this
case,
railroad
brought
the
suit
down
in
florida,
naming
united
states
and
the
commission
as
defendants.
the
shipper
wasn't
named,
hasn't
intervened
so
the
burden
of
sustaining
the
reparation
order
was
transferred
as
a
practical
matter
from
the
shipper
to
the
government.
in
the
meantime,
the
shipper
has
filed
his
own
suit
under
16
(2)
up
in
new
york
city.
that
suit
is
being
held
in
the
abeyance
on
this
litigation.
the
respondent
railroad
contend
that
the
provisions
of
17
(9)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
1336
of
the
code
in
authorizing
actions
to
enjoin
any
order
of
commission
must
be
read
as
including
all
orders.
now,
we
--
we
point
out
that
this
court
in
a
series
of
cases,
los
angeles
railroad,
griffin
has
held
to
the
contrary.
in
waterman
for
example,
these
cases
were
--
were
summarized
briefly
by
this
court
as
follows
and
i
quote,
“this
court
long
has
held
that
statutes
which
employ
broad
terms,
to
confer
power
of
judicial
review
are
not
always
to
be
read
literally.
rather
this
court
has
held
that
the
meaning
of
a
statutory
provision
for
review
of
any
order
must
be
read
and
must
be
found
in
the
context
of
a
statute
about.”
and
so,
we
say
that
this
court
is
wholly
free
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
to
hold
that
a
railroad
may
attack
a
reparation
order
only
by
way
of
defense
to
a
shipper's
suit
under
16
(2)
in
order
to
carry
out
the
legislative
policies
underlying
16
(2).
next
the
railroads
contend
that
they
should
not
be
relegated
to
defense
in
a
16
(2)
suit
because
they
say
16
(2)
is
not
a
review
provision
and
they
seem
to
say
that
the
district
court
in
a
16
(2)
suit
brought
by
the
shipper
would
not
have
power
to
review
the
commission's
findings.
we
think
this
court
has
clearly
held
of
the
contrary.
in
1915
in
meeker
case,
this
court
held
that
section
16
(2),
cuts
off
no
defense,
interposes
no
obstacle
to
a
full
contestation
of
all
the
issues.
and
in
1949
in
u.s.
v.
icc
this
court
referred
as
guaranteeing
railroads
a
complete
judicial
review
of
adverse
reparation
orders.
so
we
submit
that
there
would
no
unfairness
in
relegating
the
railroads
to
the
remedy
of
defending
against
the
reparation
order
by
way
of
defense
to
the
shipper's
16
(2)
suit.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
unsupported
by
evidence?
it
should
have
after
unfair
procedure
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
--
they
can
attack
it
in
any
ground
which
they
could
raise
in
a
direct
review
proceeding,
legal
evidentiary
procedure.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
there
are
number
of
such
cases
in
the
books
through
the
years.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
what
would
happen
that
the
defending
carrier
will
--
would
produce
a
record,
evidentiary
record
made
before
the
commission
and
state
that
this
record
does
--
just
doesn't
provide
substantial
evidentiary
support
for
the
commission‘s
findings.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
case
has
suggests
as
a
practical
matter
one
or
two
things
happens.
if
the
shipper
comes
into
court
in
section
16
(2)
suit
with
a
certified
copy
of
a
commission
report
and
order
and
nothing
more
happens,
he's
got
his
prima
facie
case
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
carrier
can
do
one
or
two
things.
he
can
seek
to
introduce
evidence
de
novo
in
the
court
so
i
think
there
would
be
a
growing
reluctance
on
the
part
of
courts
to
permit
that.
most
likely
what
he
would
do
today,
he
would
present
the
evidentiary
record
made
before
the
commission
and
state
“this
is
--
this
record
does
not
provide
evidentiary
support
of
the
commission's
findings.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
the
way
the
statute
seems
to
read.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
not
to
get
more
than
the
commission
had
awarded
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
i
take
at
that
evidence
normally
it
would
be
in
the
form
of
a
certified
copy
of
the
evidence
which
he
had
presented
to
the
commission.
presumably,
he
has
made
his
case
there.
as
a
practical
matter,
both
shipper
and
carrier
will
have
made
their
case
before
the
commission.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
for
--
the
purpose
of
my
argument,
i
really
don't
have
to
say
this
certainly
and
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
all
i
have
to
say
is
in
our
committee
it's
entirely
fair
to
relegate
the
carrier
to
it’s
defense
of
a
shipper’s
suit
under
16
(2).
all
i
have
to
show
and
i
think
i
have
is
that
the
scope
of
review
available
to
the
carrier
in
a
16
(2)
is
at
least
as
broad
as
it
would
be
in
a
direct
review
proceeding.
and
this
court
i
think
is
so
held
is
at
least
that
broad.
if
--
if
the
carrier
gets
a
broader
review
in
his
defense
to
the
section
16
(2)
suit.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
of
the
conclusion
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
of
course,
the
carrier
could
reply
without
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
how
can
i
settle
for
a
narrower
scope
of
review,
i'd
take
my
chances
with
that.
but
from
--
to
support
my
position,
i
need
only
demonstrate
and
i
think
i
have
that
the
scope
of
review
available
to
the
railroad
as
a
defendant
of
16
(2)
suit
is
at
least
is
broad.
at
the
review,
he
could
get
it
in
any
other
way.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
the
concern
which
you
just
expressed
sir
seems
to
be
the
core
i
think
of
the
decision
below.
the
court
of
appeals
put
it
this
way
and
it
is
pages
58
and
59
of
the
record.
the
court
said,
“this
assures
some
symmetry
and
the
construction
and
maintenance
of
a
national
transportation
policy.”
the
attorney
general
the
general
counsel
of
the
commission
are
directly
and
immediately
responsible
for
the
conduct
of
that
litigation
and
the
advocate
of
an
assertion
of
contentions
being
essential
in
the
public
interest.
the
court
below
added
that
by
contrast
in
the
shippers
16
(2)
suit,
absent
intervention
by
united
states
of
the
commission.
it
said,
“the
sole
spokesman
in
behalf
of
the
commission's
order
as
the
private
party
seeking
partisan
relief
opposed
by
formidable
experienced
counsel
for
the
commission.
now
with
all
respect
to
the
court
below
that's
been
no
showing
made
that
public
interest
have
suffered
by
leaving
the
enforcement
of
--
of
reparation
orders
to
shippers
under
section
16
(2).
we
cannot
recall,
certainly
not
in
my
10
years
in
the
commission,
i
can't
recall
a
section
16
(2)
suit
in
which
united
states
or
the
commission
has
sought
to
intervene.
surely,
we
would
consider
it,
if
one
were
called
to
out
attention
involving
broad
transportation
issues.
but
in
practice
that
isn't
what
has
happened.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
the
review
and
also
an
inadequate
enforcement
machinery
in
which
--
in
which
the
burden
of
enforcement
was
left
by
the
congress
to
the
shipper
rather
than
place
it
up
on
the
government.
and
these
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
and
the
commission
is
not
authorized
to
bring
a
suit
under
16
(2).
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
the
reparation
order
is
not
self-operative
in
the
sense
that
if
the
railroad
declines
to
pay
and
meets
the
order,
it
is
not
subject
to
any
penalty,
nothing
happens
unless
the
shipper
and
only
the
shipper
is
authorized
to
do
so,
unless
the
shipper
brings
a
suit
under
section
16
(2).
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
before
a
carrier
can
be
required
to
pay,
yes.
he
must
--
he
must
have
his
day
in
court.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
theoretically
there
could
be
such
a
case,
yes
sir.
but
i
would
also
submit
that
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
that
direct
judicial
review
be
made
available
as
long
as
the
order
is
not
self-enforcing.
congress
could
provide
for
such
direct
review.
i
would
concede
that
the
order
is
final
in
the
sense
that
the
administrative
action
is
complete.
there's
nothing
more
for
the
commission
to
do
but
we
don't
--
but
our
position
in
brief
is
that
congress
has
not
provided
for
direct
review
of
such
orders.
it
has
provided
that
the
carrier
can
have
this
day
in
court,
at
least,
as
broad
as
he
would
have
a
direct
review
proceeding
by
way
of
defense
to
the
shipper's
suit.
we
would
say
in
that
accomplishes
two
purposes.
it
leaves
the
burden
of
enforcement
of
reparation
orders
which
congress
apparently
thought
did
not
involve
typically
broad
transportation
issues
to
shippers.
at
least
the
shipper
in
a
position
in
section
13
(2)
proceeding
to
get
the
procedural
benefits
of
venue,
freedom
from
costs,
and
right
to
an
attorney's
fee
if
he
wins
which
co
--
which
are
the
tools
which
congress
gave
him
as
we
see
it,
to
carry
the
burden
of
enforcement
of
such
orders.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
had
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
sir,
it's
been
going
out
for
about
50
years.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
we
would
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
answered
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we'd
rather
stay
out.
of
course,
in
the
particular
case
involving
broad
issues
and
general
importance,
i
think
we
would
--
any
court
would
allows
us
to
intervene.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
my
10
years
with
the
commission,
we
have
not
sought
to
intervene
in
such
a
case
nor
has
one
been
called
to
our
attention
of
which
we
seriously
consider
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
maybe
so
technically
and
that
seem
to
trouble
the
court
below
a
little
bit
that
all
the
court
could
do
would
say,
“well,
you
don't
have
to
pay
this
particular
shipper
but
here
these
other
shippers
over
here
which
under
the
phillips
case
can
bring
other
suits
because
they're
similarly
situated.
our
only
answer
to
that
is
so
far
as
we
know
it
has
not
been
a
practical
problem.
we
--
we
are
not
aware
of
those
rep
–
repetitive
suits
situations.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
maybe
amazing
sir
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
surprisingly,
we
do
not
know
of
situations
for
that
it's
been
nothing.
thank
you.
