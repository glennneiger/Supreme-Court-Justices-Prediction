mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
this
honorable
court.
i
think
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
state
at
the
very
outset
that
my
answers
to
most
of
the
questions
addressed
to
mr.
ginnane
with
the
possible
exception
of
those
posed
by
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
justice
white
would
have
been
exactly
the
reverse
to
the
answers
he
gave
this
court.
for
example,
before
i
attempt
to
deal
with
my
prepared
argument,
it's
my
understanding
that
the
law
is
entirely
clear
in
response
to
the
first
question
that
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
that
the
court
could
not
change
the
amount
of
damages
which
the
commission
had
found
a
particular
complainant
to
--
entitled
to
in
a
section
1
case,
a
section
which
alleged
that
the
charges
under
attack
were
unjust
and
unreasonable
in
violation
to
that
section.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
itself
and
i
don't
have
immediate
reference
to
it
but
it's
the
brief,
this
court
itself
has
said
in
the
case
of
that
kind
and
incidentally,
the
case
that
precipitated
this
particular
proceeding
before
this
court
is
what
--
is
the
section
1
case.
this
court
has
said
that
the
amount
damages,
is
in
effect
fixed.
it's
the
difference
between
the
rate
originally
charged
which
is
a
sale
before
the
commission
as
unreasonable
and
the
commiss
--
and
the
rate
which
the
commission
decides
would
have
been
a
reasonable
rate
and
so
on.
in
other
words,
if
the
sale
rate
for
50
cents,
and
the
commission
says,
a
reasonable
rate
would
have
been
40
cents,
the
damages
are
fixed.
there
10
cents
per
100
pounds
times
the
weight
of
the
shipment
and
there's
nothing
for
the
court
to
do
with
that.
now
in
section
3
case,
where
the
allegations
before
the
commission
turn
on
a
finding
of
undue
preference
and
undue
prejudice
and
there
which
is
extremely
rare
incidentally,
there
the
commission
decides
that
the
complainant
is
entitled
to
damages.
the
amount
of
damages
there
determines
as
i
read
the
cases
can
be
looked
at
by
the
--
by
the
court
because
there
the
damages
go
beyond
the
measure
of
the
rates
charged
for
transportation.
there
the
court
is
entitled
to
look,
to
see
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
has
been
made
whole
for
his
total
damages
which
is
not
the
case
in
a
section
1
proceeding.
now
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
sir?
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
can't
give
you
a
direct
answer
now
except
to
say
that
i
don't
think
it
appears
in
the
statute,
but
it
appears
in
some
of
the
earlier
cases
of
this
court
that
i
can't
give
you
reference
to
right
here
and
now
which
dealt
with
the
amount
of
damages
awarded
by
the
commission
in
section
3
cases.
i
hesitate
to
even
guess,
it
seems
to
me
so
called
chicago
junction
case.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i'm
not
sure
that
i've
cited
in
the
brief,
the
cases
which
support
the
section
3
--
authority
of
the
court
to
change
the
amount
of
damages
in
a
section
free
case.
i
don't
think
we've
done
that.
if
the
court
wants,
i'll
be
glad
to
do
it
in
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
no,
sir,
not
at
all.
mr.
ginnane
makes
much
of
the
choice
of
venue
here.
what
he
was
very
careful
to
avoid
was
to
point
out
that
the
place
of
business
of
the
shipper
involved
was
in
illinois,
it
was
in
illinois
corporation
but
his
choice
of
venue
was
in
new
york
city.
i
don't
take
any
particular
quarrel
with
the
choice
of
venue.
i
think
--
but
i
think
i
ought
to
say
one
thing
more
about
it.
that
shipper
suit
was
filed
just
six
days
before
the
expiration
of
the
statute
of
limitations
and
i'm
speculating
somewhat
but
i
gather
that
it
was
done
largely
at
the
instance
or
suggestions
of
the
commission
itself.
if
mr.
ginnane,
mr.
goodman
says,
that's
not
so,
i
wouldn't
quarrel
or
challenge
their
word
in
that
respect.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan
spoke
about
an
order
in
the
section
16
(2)
and
asked
if
the
order
could
be
set
aside
and
the
--
the
reply
briefs
of
mr.
ginnane,
on
the
bottom
of
page
5
in
the
top
6,
admits
that
the
order
couldn't
be
set
aside.
and
you
cannot
incidentally
again
in
response
to
one
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
questions,
you
can
not
introduce
evidence
as
you
could
in
the
trial
de
novo
in
a
so-called
section
16
(2)
suit.
and
i
can
say
incidentally
that
i
learned
that
the
hard
way
because
i
was
involved
in
a
new
process
deer
case
that
mr.
ginnane
referred
to
which
was
referred
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
before
an
extremely
sympathetic
judge
and
the
facts
in
that
particular
case,
but
who
finally
decided
that
in
the
right
of
an
opinion
by
his
own
circuit
court
of
appeals,
he
had
no
choice
but
to
refuse
receipt
of
any
additional
evidence.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
just
on
the
record
before
the
commission
and
as
i
understand
it,
that's
the
only
thing
that
you
entitled
to
have.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
that's
the
new
process
deere
case.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
that's
my
understanding
of
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
that's
my
understanding
of
it
and
the
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
sir?
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
no,
sir.
they
weren't
in
the
case.
no,
i
didn't
understand
mr.
justice
white
was
asking
me
that.
it's
actually
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
exactly,
without
the
introduction
of
any
--
of
any
evidence.
i
say
that
in
any
review
proceeding,
we
are
confined
entirely
to
the
record
before
the
commission
and
the
only
thing
to
would
be
decided
is
whether
or
not
the
commission's
determination
and
its
resulting
order,
are
in
all
things
valid
as
a
matter
of
laws
as
i
think
mr.
chief
--
justice
harlan
put
it.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
we
were
denied
that
--
we
were
denied
any
attempt
to
put
in
evidence.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
that's
right.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
well,
i
think
i
can
answer
that
in
a
hurry
maybe
i
shouldn't
stop
to
my
prepared
argument
instead
of
being
so
anxious
to
answer
mr.
ginnane,
indicate
that
my
answer
would
have
been
different.
in
a
so
called
17
(9)
case
and
the
--
or
so
called
1336
case,
the
only
thing
that's
involved
is
the
validity
of
the
commission's
--
the
record
before
the
commission,
the
validity
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
commission's
determination
in
any
resulting
order
and
in
it,
you
would
allege
in
accordance
with
the
various
decisions
of
this
court,
the
commission
exceeded
its
constitutional
authority
that
it
was
invalid
or
rather
that
it
--
in
violation
of
the
constitution
that
exceeded
its
statutory
authority
or
that
in
some
other
way
it
was
in
--
arbitrary.
now,
in
the
particular
proceeding
here,
the
commission
refused
to
recognize
the
statute
of
limitation
as
the
courts
below
found.
if
that's
not
arbitrary,
i
don't
know
what
it
is?
and
that
was
the
basis
on
which
we
went
to
court
to
have
the
commission's
order
to
set
aside.
now
in
the
17
--
in
a
17
(9)
or
1336
action,
the
effect
of
it
is
contrary
to
a
section
16
(2)
order
that
the
administrative
findings
of
the
commission
and
its
order
are
set
aside.
and
then
tom
jones
or
frank
smith
or
anybody
else
in
any
other
part
of
the
country,
allegedly
similarly
situated
is
in
no
position
to
go
into
any
court,
state
or
federal
or
back
to
the
commission
and
in
effect
to
say,
i
want
the
same
treatment
as
my
brother
guy.
it
just
can't
be
done
because
the
order
is
nullified
and
set
aside
and
that's
the
crucial
thing
here.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
that
is
right.
i
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
well,
any
other
shipper
can
go
into
a
state
court
or
another
federal
district
court
and
on
the
presentation
of
the
same
record
another
court
can
decide
that
it
does
agree,
just
as
in
one
of
the
decisions
this
morning
four
the
esteemed
gentleman
on
this
bench
disagreed
with
their
five
brothers
in
a
disposition
of
a
particular
case.
in
a
case
brought
in
maine
for
example,
the
district
court
there
may
find
--
yes
the
complainant
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
--
in
the
court's
course
entitled.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i
can't
give
you
a
direct
answer
mr.
justice
brennan
to
that.
i
can't
think
of
any
at
the
moment,
but
i
do
say
more
important
to
that.
the
principles
--
the
principles
and
the
precedents
that
are
involved
in
the
administrative
findings
can
and
i'm
sure
have
been
relied
on.
i
have
no
doubt
about
that.
now,
my
time
is
fast
running.
i've
said
and
we
have
said
in
substance
in
our
brief
and
i'm
sure
i
don't
have
to
repeat
it
here
that
section
16
(2)
is
not
a
review
section
as
mr.
ginnane
has
indicated
with.
and
this
court
has
said
in
the
substances
as
has
others
that
it's
an
action
sounding
in
tort
for
damages
and
that
it's
a
civil
action
that
can
be
brought
only
by
the
party
claiming
damage
or
injury.
its
nowhere
the
accident
and
i'm
sure
it
isn't
for
the
reason
of
mr.
ginnane
said
that
the
commission
wasn't
empower
to
enforce
the
reparation
order.
it
is
because
it
involved
the
taking
of
money
which
--
in
which
they
had
no
direct
interest.
anybody
entitled
to
damages
from
a
railroad
who
is
charge
to
unlawful
rate
would
be
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
and
they
have
referred
or
left
rather
to
the
--
to
their
right
to
seek
seek
damages
they
would
as
this
court
has
said
in
any
of
the
civil
action
for
damages.
now,
1336
the
section
of
the
judicial
review
statute
that
gives
the
carriers
the
right
--
gives
anybody
a
right
to
seek,
to
enjoin
set
aside
then
no
an
commission
order
is
a
so-called
direct
review
section.
and
i'm
afraid
my
time
will
go
before
i
have
a
chance
to
say
after
the
line
if
that
so.
so
let
me
say
that
--
i
put
this
way,
if
i
may.
in
two
decisions
at
least
by
this
court,
united
states
against
icc
and
pennsylvania
against
united
states,
the
opinions
in
which
were
both
written
by
mr.
justice
black,
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
no
question
whatever
that
this
court
has
in
all
and
every
--
in
practical
results
taken
the
position
already
that
suits
to
it
maybe
brought
to
enjoin
any
order
for
the
requirement
of
the
commission
and
not
as
they
say
any
order
except
one
requiring
the
payment
of
money.
now,
the
late
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
first
case,
united
states
against
the
icc
reported
at
337
u.s.
in
a
--
in
a
dissent
that
if
i
recall
correctly
was
longer
rather
than
the
opinion.
trying
to
read
into
the
statute,
into
the
section
16
(2)
the
very
language
that
mr.
ginnane
contends
for
all
practical
purposes
is
there.
that
the
--
that
the
--
i
guess
it's
the
other
way
around,
excuse
me,
that
1336,
trying
to
read
into
that
language.
any
order
or
requirement
other
than
one
for
the
payment
of
money,
but
the
court
obviously
didn't
listen
to
it
then
and
i
know
of
no
reason
why
i
should
listen
to
him
now.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
there's
no
question
--
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
that
that's
true
because
as
the
court
pointed
below
mr.
justice
white,
any
complainant
before
the
commission
can
as
a
matter
of
right
to
intervene
in
a
suit
that
is
brought
by
a
carrier
against
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commission.
and
incidentally
as
i
mention
in
that
brief,
right
now
we
have
an
action
similar
to
this
pending
in
the
district
court
in
baltimore.
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly,
it's
been
there
over
two
years
now,
waiting
the
disposition
of
this
jurisdictional
issue,
involving
some
16
or
18
complainants
--
plaintiffs
before
the
--
complainants
before
the
commission.
in
a
few
instances,
two
have
intervened
in
the
proceeding
and
filed
a
counter
claim,
seeking
damages
and
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
and
costs
and
i
don't
think
there's
anything
wrong
with
that.
i
think
that's
entirely
proper
but
the
important
thing
about
the
disposition
that
we're
trying
to
make
indicates
of
that
time
where
the
plaintiff
as
if
they
become,
excuse
me,
where
the
complainants
before
the
commission
were
all
the
way
from
california
to
maine.
i'm
sure
that
the
figures
are
minimum
of
16
and
i
recall
a
republic
steel
company
in
cleveland.
i
recall
somebody
else
in
san
francisco,
california.
now
apart
from
those
16
or
18,
the
entitlement
to
bring
suits
that
are
in
any
time
in
the
course
of
the
first
year
to
enforce
the
order
there,
other
people
unrelated
to
the
action
who
had
similar
transportation
services
performed
with
them
on
the
strength
for
the
reparation
of
the
administrative
findings
and
order
which
we
are
there
seeking
review
of,
could
go
into
any
state
court
or
any
federal
district
court
and
ask
for
damages
on
the
strength
to
those
findings.
now,
the
action
that
we're
attempting
to
take
is
to
clear
the
air
promptly.
if
we
don't
do
that
we
got
to
sit
by
and
wait
for
the
expiration
of
12
months
to
see
if
any
body
is
going
to
sue
us
if
we
don't
comply.
perhaps
even
more
important
in
that
ethically
is
no
other
way,
this
statute,
the
interstate
commerce
act
makes
it
a
duty
of
carriers
to
comply
with
any
order
of
the
commission
as
long
it
is
on
the
book
so
to
speak.
and
while
as
my
friend
says
there's
no
“penalty”
as
there
is,
if
you
fail
to
comply
with
an
order,
“telling
you
to
publish
a
rate
for
the
future
to
take
effect
one
month
from
today
when
you
can
be
subject
to
a
$5,000
fine,
there
are
penalties
here
as
the
law
or
the
court
find
it
out
and
the
--
as
this
court
has
said
itself
in
the
baldwin
case
which
is
likewise
been
shown
in
--
decided
in
my
brief.
the
purpose
of
16
(2),
according
to
this
court
was
not
to
place
the
burden
of
enforcement
as
mr.
ginnane
puts
it
on
the
complainant
for
the
reasons
i
have
indicated.
the
commission
itself
couldn't
do
it.
in
any
other
respect
or
any
other
case,
they
have
the
right
under
section
16
(12)
to
go
into
court
and
so
do
other
people
as
well
to
compel
enforcement.
in
the
case
of
a
suit
for
money,
that's
left
to
the
private
parties,
but
the
--
i
forgot
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
in
any
event
the
point
of
it
here
is,
we
would
be,
i
started
to
say
about
the
baldwin
case.
in
the
baldwin
case,
this
--
this
court
said
in
the
substance
that
the
reason
for
16
(2)
was
to
preclude
reluctant
railroad.
i
don't
know
if
they
use
the
term
reluctant
or
not,
but
they
certainly
used
terms
like
coercive.
they
wanted
to
keep
railroads
from
offering,
harassing
resistance
to
comply
with
these
orders
when
they
didn't
have
a
defense.
now,
we
are
not
here
because
we
didn't
think
we
had
a
defense
to
these
things.
we
think
quite
--
quite
to
the
contrary
and
that's
the
reason
we
probably
would
has
a
good
offense
and
undertook
the
pursue
it
and
i'm
not
at
all
impressed
by
mr.
ginnane's
continued
repetition
about
it
here
and
in
the
brief
but
this
is
the
first
time
in
50
years
that
somebody
has
thought
of
seeking
judicial
review
directly.
maybe
there
were
another
case
as
i'm
--
i'd
be
the
first
to
say
that
in
the
--
i
would
think
in
the
large
of
jar
of
instances
where
that
railroads
defend
reparation
cases
before
the
commission
and
lose
they
comply
with
them.
they
pay
comm
--
they
pay
the
amount
specified
in
the
commission's
order
with
interest.
it's
only
an
extreme
cases
whereas
in
this
one
in
the
baltimore
one
that
i've
talked
about
where
they're
satisfied
and
would
believe
in
their
minds
that
they
have
a
good
reason
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
of
the
commission's
administrative
findings
and
order
as
a
matter
of
law
that
they
do
what
they
did
here.
and
again,
that
doesn't
deprive
any
shipper
of
a
choice
of
venue
or
attorney's
fees
or
anything
else
if
he
chooses
to
protect
themselves,
but
he
doesn't
even
have
to
do
it.
but
the
lower
court
commented
on
that
too
and
pointed
out
that
as
practical
matters,
if
we
have
a
direct
review
proceeding
and
lose,
the
complainant
before
the
commission
is
almost
home
free
so
to
speak.
there's
no
defense
left
then
in
the
section
16
(2)
and
contrary
to
the
position
taken
by
the
government,
i
can't
imagine
any
single
instance
in
which
railroads,
who
lost
the
direct
review
proceeding
brought
under
section
17
(9)
or
1336,
not
to
mention
the
administrative
procedure
act,
incidentally,
would
even
bother
trying
further
to
contest
the
validity
of
that
action
or
require
any
complainant
--
any
complainant
to
become
a
plaintiff
in
a
section
16
(2)
suit
to
get
the
reparation
that
then
i
don't
think
any
defense
to
which
it
is
simple
as
that
to
me.
now,
the
--
another
thing
that
i
think
this
court
should
know
is
that
in
the
cases
that
i
referred
to
already
which
the
opinions
are
written
by
mr.
justice
black,
the
united
states
took
a
position
directly
opposite
that
which
the
united
states
and
the
commission
combined
are
attempting
to
turn
it
here.
in
those
cases,
they
in
effect
said
and
i
pointed
this
out
in
my
brief
as
i
recall
correctly
at
page
19
and
begin
around
33.
in
those
cases,
the
united
states
took
the
position
in
substance
that
this
language
of
the
statute
was
clear
and
that
there
was
no
doubt
at
all
that
any
order
meant
any
order
and
that
any
party
could
attack
him
in
a
section
1336
suit.
now
in
its
brief,
the
--
and
particularly
in
its
reply
brief
as
i
recall
correctly
or
if
it
is
not
there
incidentally,
it
is
in
the
government's
brief
in
the
case
following
this
immediately,
the
consolo
case
which
was
not
consultative
for
oral
argument
by
this
court
but
in
the
in
its
--
in
its
brief
--
i'm
sorry,
i've
lost
my
thought
and
i'm
trying
to
find
a
place
it
here.
oh,
in
its
brief,
they
--
now,
i
have
lost
my
thought.
finally
--
finally,
the
court
--
i'm
sorry
the
government
in
its
–
argument
here
says
in
substance
that
the
fact
that
there's
slight
difference
that
they
talk
about
in
a
section
16
(2)
suit.
he
can
get
the
administrative
findings
and
order
set
aside
and
the
other
when
you
can
is
from
that
standpoint
doesn't
mean
anything
that
we
have
no
cause
to
compliant.
oh,
i
say
with
that's
all
--
that's
all
the
cause
in
the
world
we
need
to
complain.
what
they
may
think
is
minor
in
some
instances
maybe
major
from
our
standpoint
–
one
thing
more;
mr.
ginnane
referred
to
a
case
that
was
before
the
courts
in
the
1913,
if
i
recall
correctly
the
so
called
southern
railway
case
and
mentioned
the
fact
that
nothing
came
of
that
because
of
the
complaint
was
withdrawn
and
it
couldn't
be
appealed.
i
think
the
court
should
know
that
the
decision
in
that
case,
it
wasn't
written
by
was
at
least
joined
in
by
judge
knapp
who
had
been
challenging
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
some
12
or
14
years,
prior
to
his
appointment
to
the
bench
and
as
such
he
appeared
as
a
witness
before
congress
on
a
number
of
occasions
when
revisions
of
the
act
where
under
consideration.
he
certainly,
if
anybody
was,
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
“any
order
or
requirement”
at
the
time
the
decision
in
the
southern
case
was
laid
down.
and
that
--
that
one
important
in
that
it
was
referred
to
in
a
st
louis
versus
ophalen
case
by
this
court
which
again
is
referred
to
in
our
brief.
i
wouldn't
for
a
moment
consider
--
i'm
sorry
i
find
my
time
is
in
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
thank
you.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
thank
you.
i
wouldn't
attempt
the
burden
the
court
with
comments
on
the
legislative
history
there
of
this
--
of
the
hepburn
act
which
is
referred
to
both
in
brief
and
mr.
ginnane's
argument.
but
the
--
there's
no
question
but
what
--
there
was
extensive
discussion
in
the
congress
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
language
that
we're
here
particularly
concern
with
any
order
or
requirement.
i
have
here
represent
pages
of
40
congressional
record
beginning
at
6685
and
running
through
6787.
i
just
like
to
say
that
in
the
discussion
on
the
floor
the
--
the
knowledge
of
these
words
and
the
import
was
so
well
understood
that
senator
bacon
asked
not
once
but
several
times
if
there
was
any
language
in
any
words
in
the
dictionary
that
could
be
more
specific
in
substance
and
at
one
spot
and
this
is
short,
so
i
suppose
i
must
point
to
this
extent
at
40
congressional
records
6773
when
they
were
discussing
an
amendment
which
eventually
became
part
of
the
hepburn
act,
senator
bacon
said,
“here
is
an
amendment
offered
by
the
senator
from
iowa
which
is
absolutely
without
limitation
which
is
as
broad
as
human
language
can
make
it,
giving
to
the
court
the
right
to
review
every
order
or
requirement
made
by
the
commission.”
now,
the
thing
that
i
haven't
understood
from
the
beginning
of
this
proceeding
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
senator
bacon.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
with
reference
to
this
particular
pros
--
that
the
hepburn
amendment
when
i
was
under
consideration
on
the
floor
of
congress
and
the
section
that
was
then
being
discussed
was
section
5
where
this
particular
language
occurs
where
the
jurisdiction
and
venue
is
conferred
with
respect
to
and
i
quote
again,
“any
order
or
requirement”
of
the
commission.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
sir?
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i
can't
answer
that.
mr.
boyer
who
will
be
one
of
those
arguing
in
the
next
case
i'm
sure
can.
i
started
to
say
that
finally
that
the
one
thing
that
i
don't
understand
is
the
thought
of
the
commission
that
when
an
order
--
when
administrative
findings
and
orders
by
the
commission
in
a
reparation
case
are
attacked
by
the
losing
party
that
the
commission
shouldn't
be
called
upon
to
defend
that.
they
admit,
they
found
out
the
hard
way
in
337
u.s.
that
if
they
deny
reparation
it's
proper
to
seek
review
--
to
find
out
whether
denial
was
proper
as
matter
of
law.
they
found
out
in
363
that
the
losing
party
in
a
referral
case,
one
that
reached
the
commission
from
me
to
the
court
of
claims
for
example,
the
state
court
or
anything
like
that
the
losing
party
can
seek
review
before
the
courts
under
section
1336,
but
in
the
case
of
a
railroad
who
loses
before
the
commission
in
a
case,
they
say
you
can't
have
direct
review
there.
it
must
wait
on
the
eventually
of
possibility
that
you
will
be
sued
in
court
within
the
one
year
and
if
nobody
sues
you,
the
--
as
the
court
below
said,
you
are
left
with
unsatisfactory
law
for
all
to
use
them
satisfactory
presents.
i
trust
that
this
court
will
be
as
impressed
by
the
decision
of
the
lower
court,
circuit
court
of
appeals
as
i
was
and
will
find
accordingly.
thank
you.
