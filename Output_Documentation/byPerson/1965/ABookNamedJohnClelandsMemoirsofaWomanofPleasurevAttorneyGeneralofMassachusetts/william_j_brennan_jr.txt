justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
help
me
because
i
haven't
read
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
mr.
rembar
that
expert
testimony,
if
i
get
what
you're
saying,
if
a
number
of
distinguished
literary
critics
say
this
book
has
social
value
that
ought
to
be
enough
for
us.
but
i
gather
they're
on
the
experts,
aren't
they?
and
i
--
if
the
ultimate
decision
is
for
us,
i
thought
expert
testimony
was
only
to
aid
not
to
decide
for
the
ultimate
fact
or
other
determiner
of
what
such
help
as
it
may
give
but
i
don't
think
it
could
be
substitution
for
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
--
i
might
understand
this
if
it
were
a
problem
in
nuclear
physics,
but
i
wonder
if
that
carries
over
in
this
area.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rembar,
i'd
just
like
to
get
this
clear
now.
this
follows
up
with
mr.
justice
stewart.
are
you
urging
on
us
that
we
set
that
where
there
is
testimony
directed
to
the
issue
of
redeeming
social
value
and
that
is
credible
testimony
of
acknowledged
experts
in
the
field
that
that
ends
any
obscenity
case
without
ever
reading
the
material
involved.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
--
that
is
well-written
literate,
pornography
is
outside.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
doesn't
mean
that?
well,
we're
dealing
--
we're
dealing,
i
guess,
by
hypothesis
with
what's
pornographic
material
as
to
which
however
a
number
of
acknowledged
literary
critics
are
willing
to
say
it
has
some
literary
and
therefore
social
value
because
it's
well
written.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
roth
said
that
much
i
think,
didn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
literary
value,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
is
not
because
it
has
some
special
moral
to
convey
--
is
it
only
in
that
it
is
well-written,
well-expressed,
whatever
the
story
maybe
that
it
tells?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
suggesting
you,
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
all
add
up
to
something
well
and
powerfully
written?
does
that
add
up
to
anything
more?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what
--
do
you
mean
if
--
this
means
that
ultimately
we
do
have
to
look
at
all
the
stuff
and
read
all
these
books?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
--
i
gather
you
don't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
this
expert
testimony
is
of
no
utility
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
making
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
one
last
question
mr.
rembar?
the
--
i
gather
you're
saying
that
the
roth
test
is
a
constitutional
test?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
because
it's
a
constitutional
test,
its
application
necessarily
is
a
constitutional
judgment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
constitutional
judgments,
the
last
of
the
line
is
this
courtroom.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
--
it's
not
a
matter
of
experts
in
this
field
that
ours
is
the
ultimate
constitutional
responsibility.
now,
whether
you
call
us
experts
or
anything
else,
we
have
to
make
this
ultimate
judgment,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
we're
not
making
a
judgment
as
experts
in
literature
or
prurient
interest
or
anything
else,
but
any
experts
in
the
application
of
the
constitutional
test.
