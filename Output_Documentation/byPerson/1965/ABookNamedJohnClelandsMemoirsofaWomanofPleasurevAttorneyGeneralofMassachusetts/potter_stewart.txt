it
is
your
point,
mr.
rembar,
that
simply
as
a
matter
of
law,
not
as
a
matter
of
fact,
but
as
a
matter
of
law
if
witnesses
of
this
caliber
and
stature
and
good
faith
testify
to
this,
then
no
matter
how
many
people
disagree
with
them,
if
there
--
if
there
are
those
people
of
this
caliber
willing
to
testify
and
able
to
testify
under
oath
to
this,
then
no
court
could
hold
that
this
was
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
--
witnesses,
now
we're
talking
about
witnesses
under
oath.
justice
potter
stewart
but
our
test
has
been
utterly
without.
justice
potter
stewart
utterly
without
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
can
have
a
work
conceivably
have
that
redeeming
social
importance
because
of
its
literary
value,
because
of
its
moral
value,
because
of
its
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
theologic
and
anything
else.
justice
potter
stewart
because
a
court
as
a
matter
of
law
could
not
then
hold
that
it
was
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
you
--
do
you
think
--
excuse
me.
do
you
think
it's
clear
to
you,
as
apparently
to
your
predecessors
here
today
have,
that
the
court
has
clearly
established
the
test
of
obscenity
as
three-component
test
of
a
pure
and
prurient
interest
and
utterly
without
redeeming
social
value
and
something
as
patently
offensive?
justice
potter
stewart
where
did
you
get
that,
from
what
case?
