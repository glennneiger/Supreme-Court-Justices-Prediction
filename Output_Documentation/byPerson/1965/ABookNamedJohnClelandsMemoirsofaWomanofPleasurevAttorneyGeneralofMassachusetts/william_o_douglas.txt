justice

so
if
you
got
one
baptist
minister
at
one
side
and
a
thousand
in
the
other,
you
couldn't
say
that
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
utterly
with?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
see.
but
you
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
the
minister
might
have
turned
light
upon
redeeming
social
value,
might
he
not?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
if
he
testifies
and
use
it
to
his
own
therapy
and
counseling
those
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
book
was
published
first
in
1774?
justice
william
o.
douglas
1749,
then
under
your
historical
argument,
i
suppose
anything
that
would
now
in
1965
show
what
people
were
thinking
about
or
doing,
1749
would
past
muster.
justice
william
o.
douglas
showing
how
bad
our
forefathers
were?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
reduces
the
extent
of
books
on
mathematics
and
books
on
religion.
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
this
book
ever
prosecuted,
the
publisher
or
dealer
in
the
18th
century?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
--
that's
been
the
court's
standard,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
the
wording
of
the
court
as
i
call
it,
utterly
without.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
want
us
to
change
that
to
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
when
--
when
you
get
it
--
even
courts,
just
splitting
four
to
three,
it's
difficult
to
say
it's
utterly
without,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
all
these
things
that
they
covered
through
is
something,
because
we're
all
--
we're
dealing
with
human
institutions
not
with
ibm
machines.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
we
had
a
case
from
rhode
island,
a
little
different
case.
there
was
a
commission
up
there.
you
may
have
remembered
something
about
it
that
was
reviewing,
which
is
free
willing,
reviewing
literature
and
using
of
course
the
power
of
state
to
suppress
publications.
and
they
have
to
--
as
i
remember,
even
though
they
were
a
seven-man
commission,
i
think
even
though
it
was
four-to-three
that
it
was
--
that
it
was
obscene.
they
would
still
nonetheless
move
in
and
suppress
the
book.
but
if
there
--
i
can't
get
away
from
even
though
there
are
three
people
out
of
seven
who
think
that
there
is
some
redeeming
--
how
can
we
say
that
it
is
utterly
without?
justice
william
o.
douglas
don't
we
need
a
--
more
or
less
a
unanimity?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
have
never
said
that
yet,
but
i'm
beginning
to
wonder
whether
or
not
it's
being
pushed
to
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
wasn't
thinking
about
the
other
case
about
finding
one
baptist
minister
who
would
stand
up
for
the
book
that
--
when
you
find
a
body
of
people
like
we
have
here,
how
can
you
say
--
i'm
not
talking
about
judges
now,
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
your
experts.
how
can
you
say
that
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
they're
utterly
without?
justice
william
o.
douglas
really,
why
is
it
obscene?
i
mean,
don't
understand
your
argument.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
say
it
gives
us
a
very
dreary
job.
if
this
is
a
dreary
stuff,
then
why
is
it
obscene?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that
--
that
ends
up
--
it's
best
if
it
would
be
in
the
supreme
board
of
censors
then,
does
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
we
could
only
render
advisory
opinions,
we
could
just
have
our
own
list.
justice
william
o.
douglas
another
alternative
that
i
agreed
to
you
early
would
be
to
--
for
us
to
hold
that
a
publication
is
not
obscene
if
there
is
in
the
record
respectable
minority
opinion
that
it
has
a
social
review.
justice
william
o.
douglas
did
we
approve
of
â€˜tropic
of
cancer'?
