mr.
william
i.
cowin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
has
been
oblique
eight-and-a-half
years
of
government
attorneys
appearing
before
this
court
in
obscenity
cases.
since
the
time
in
june
of
1957
when
a
majority
of
this
court
rejected
the
contention
that
the
first
amendment
might
be
absolute
and
said
that
implicit
in
the
history
of
the
first
amendment
is
the
rejection
of
obscenity
as
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance.
the
government
attorneys
have
appeared
here
time,
and
again,
and
have
lost,
and
have
lost.
and
yet,
during
this
period,
the
court
has
yet
to
say
that
any
form
of
expression
is
exempt
from
this
determination
that
obscenity
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
magazines
presumably
are
included,
as
well
as
photographs,
hardcover
books
would
be
included
as
well
as
a
film,
a
novel
would
be
included
such
as
what
we're
dealing
with
here
today
as
well
as
an
anthology.
this
is
still
a
position
despite
pressures
upon
the
court
to
adopt
an
all-inclusive
absolute
view
of
the
first
amendment.
in
1964,
in
the
jacobellis
case,
this
court
said
we
would
reiterate
our
recognition
in
roth
that
obscenity
is
excluded
from
the
constitutional
protection.
in
accordance
with
this
determination,
the
court
has
developed
certain
standards
to
determine
exactly
what
is
to
be
considered
obscene.
i
would
gather
that
this
effort
indicates
that
the
court
intends
these
standards
to
be
applied
and
that
there
will
be
certain
materials,
novels
included,
since
the
court
has
never
specifically
exempted
them
which
will
meet
the
standards
and
accordingly
be
declared
obscene.
yet,
in
the
intervening
eight-and-a-half
years
since
the
roth
test,
the
court
has
affirmed
efforts
in
the
parts
of
states
and
of
lower
federal
courts
to
regulate
in
only
three
cases
on
the
same
day.
the
day
upon
which
roth
and
alberts
were
decided
and
on
the
same
day
the
case,
kingsley
books
versus
brown.
even
in
these
cases,
the
court
did
not
primarily
go
to
the
nature
of
the
materials
themselves.
in
roth
and
alberts,
the
presumed
obscenity
of
the
materials
was
conceded,
the
court
considered
only
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
obscenity
legislation
could
be
constitutional
and
in
the
kingsley
books
versus
brown
case,
the
court
was
primarily
concerned
with
the
question
as
to
whether
a
civil
injunctive
procedure
against
the
book
would
be
appropriate.
in
all
other
cases,
either
the
application
of
the
test
themselves
or
certain
procedural
questions
have
defeated
the
attempts
of
the
state
or
of
the
particular
federal
statute
which
was
involved
to
regulate.
the
question
is
raised
accordingly,
especially
with
the
form
of
expression
with
which
we
are
dealing
today,
a
novel
without
accompanying
illustrations
or
presumably
without
accompanying
actions
stemming
from
it,
whether
or
not
this
test
can
ever
be
applicable
to
this
form
of
literature
or
whether
perhaps
this
is
a
form
of
writing
which
goes
beyond
to
which
the
test
cannot
be
applicable.
this
is
the
position
i
believe
that
the
appellant
would
have
us
take.
granted,
the
application
of
test
to
any
kind
of
expression
is
an
extremely
sensitive
complex
business
between
the
limitations
--
between
the
delimitations
upon
this
area
that
are
created
on
the
one
hand
by
an
absolute
view
of
the
first
amendment
and
on
the
other
hand
by
the
pre-roth
more
liberal
permissive
reaction
of
this
court
toward
state
regulation.
this
is
an
extremely
complex
area.
i
would
not
suggest
for
a
minute
that
this
was
a
question
that
the
court
could
determine
easily
or
for
that
matter
determine
without
a
careful
examination
of
the
book
that
is
before
it.
on
the
other
hand,
the
appellant
takes
a
view
of
the
test
which
i
submit
is
a
distorted
view.
his
view
makes
it
absolutely
impossible
ever
to
apply
the
test
to
a
particular
piece
of
writing.
in
his
view,
there
can
never
really
be
a
piece
of
writing
that
does
not
have
some
of
that.
there
can
never
really
be
a
piece
of
writing
that
really
appeals
to
prurient
interest
of
the
average
person.
and
in
his
view,
i
am
forced
to
gather
that
the
average
person
simply
is
not
offended
by
anything
anymore.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
position
--
is
a
position
that
the
court
has
either
adopted
already
or
is
going
to
adopt.
rather,
i
think
that
the
three
tests
that
the
court
has
developed
are
tests
which
can
be
appropriately
and
reasonably
applied
to
materials
such
as
the
one,
such
as
the
material
that
is
before
the
court
and
that
in
this
particular
case,
such
a
reasonable
application
will
result
in
a
determination
that
this
book
is
obscene
and
can
constitutionally
be
suppressed.
the
book
is
in
the
record
and
it
is
certainly
unnecessary
to
refer
to
it
at
length.the
nature
of
it
is
obvious.
when
the
book
was
before
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
the
larkin
case,
mr.
chief
justice
desmond,
who
was
the
dissenting
judge
in
that
case,
referred
to
the
book
as
follows,
the
book
is
“pornography”
in
the
strictest
etymological
sense
of
the
word
since
it
is
quite
literally,
“the
narration
by
a
prostitute
of
the
particulars
of
their
trade”.
it
takes
ten
pages
for
cleland
to
get
fanny
from
the
outskirts
of
england
into
the
center
of
london
and
it
has
been
commented
that
some
of
cleland's
contemporaries,
to
whom
the
appellant
is
referred,
take
almost
as
many
volumes
to
move
their
characters
from
place
to
place,
although,
i
realize
the
counting
pages
in
a
book
is
not
a
test
in
and
of
itself.
it
perhaps
can
be
indicative
of
the
subject
matter
which
is
being
treated.
of
the
remaining
204
pages
in
this
book,
there
are
sexual
scenes
and
descriptions
and
references
on
all
the
32
pages.
these
32
pages
are
transitional
in
nature
but
even
in
these
much
relates
discusses
or
describes
or
refers
to
the
scenes
that
are
either
have
gone
before
or
there
about
to
come.
a
catalog
of
acts,
that
would
be
unnecessary
and
i
think
inappropriate.
the
--
i
would
simply
mention
that
unlike
a
book
such
as
the
“tropic
of
cancer”
where
their
reader
was
forced
to
do
quite
a
bit
of
searching
for
what
he
might
have
felt
with
more
interesting
scenes,
this
is
a
book
that
is
ideal
for
the
schema,
absolutely,
no
searching
is
necessary
at
all.
the
book
can
be
opened
any
point
and
the
so-called
prurient
reader
will
find
what
he
is
looking
for.
the
heroine
herself
comments
at
the
outset
of
the
second
letter
of
the
book.
i
imagined
indeed
that
you
would
have
been
cloyed
and
tied
with
uniformity
of
adventures
and
expressions
and
i'm
inclined
to
agree.
in
the
roth
case
in
1957,
the
court
announced
all
ideas
having
even
the
slightest
redeeming
social
importance,
unorthodox
ideas,
controversial
ideas,
even
ideas
hateful
to
the
prevailing
climate
of
opinion
have
the
full
protection
of
the
guarantees
unless
excludible
because
they
encroach
upon
the
limited
area
of
more
important
interest.
and
this
approach,
the
so-called
social
value
of
test
has
been
reiterated
again
recently
in
the
jacobellis
case
of
last
year.
the
appellant
takes
the
position
that
an
easy
way
out
for
the
court
is
simply
to
examine
the
record
to
see
whether
or
not
there
is
expert
testimony
on
the
subject
of
social
value
or
redeeming
importance
and
if
such
testimony
appears
that
this
--
the
court
must
adopt
it,
must
accept
it
and
this
in
effect
ends
the
case
since
it
is
found
that
the
book
has
social
value.
i'm
afraid
that
it's
impossible
for
me
to
agree
with
this,
primary
--
first
of
all,
this
is
an
approach
which
has
not
been
adopted
in
the
taking
of
any
kind
of
expert
testimony.
expert
testimony
is
always
taken
subject
to
the
ultimate
determination
of
the
trier
of
fact,
be
at
a
jury
or
a
judge
as
in
the
present
case,
as
to
whether
or
not
to
believe
the
opinions
of
the
experts.
but
perhaps
even
more
important
and
especially
in
an
area
such
as
this
which
is
of
such
extreme
constitutional
sensitivity,
we
take
--
we
are
getting
a
loaded
case
from
the
experts.
the
example
which
immediately
comes
to
my
mind
might
come
from
an
eminent
domain
proceeding
where
an
appraiser
who
testifies
as
to
the
value
of
land
may
have
some
bias
or
predetermination
that
in
all
instances,
he
is
going
to
make
sure
that
the
person
whose
land
has
been
taken
gets
50
times
the
value
of
the
land.certainly,
this
would
be
expert
opinion
which
would
be
subject
to
doubt.
i
believe
that
the
expert
opinion
that
we
have
in
obscenity
cases
is
quite
similar
in
light
--
in
the
sense
of
having
this
bias.
i
have
no
complaint
as
to
the
qualifications
or
the
good
will
of
the
experts
who
appeared
in
the
trial
in
this
case.
one
of
them,
in
fact,
professor
john
bullitt
was
a
professor
of
mine
when
i
was
in
college.
but
these
men
come
into
court
with
a
predetermination,
a
sophisticated
understanding,
that
all
it
is
necessary
in
light
of
current
decisions
of
this
court
to
protect
the
piece
of
writing
is
the
discovery
of
some
value
in
it,
and
they
are
dedicated
to
the
idea
that
they
are
going
to
discover
this
value.
therefore,
if
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
it
has
sir.
and
this
--
and
these
experts
know
that
it's
been
the
court's
standard
and
they
are
going
to
put
into
the
record
just
what
is
needed
to
save
a
book
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
on
a
disinterested
examination
of
this
book,
a
court
may
find
it
to
have
such
that.
the
--
it
might
be
a
word
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
it
was,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
not
in
the
slightest.
i
--
the
perfect
agreement
with
the
test
as
reasonably
applied
the
--
but
i
do
not
believe
that
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
not
if
there
is
a
reasonable
attempt
to
be
made
as
to
whether
or
not
the
value
that
the
experts
have
discovered
is
the
value
which
his
actually
in
the
book
that
john
cleland
wrote
approximately
200
years
ago
or
simply
cleland
filtered
through
a
variety
of
expert
witnesses
who
have
imposed
their
own
value
upon
what
they
have
found
in.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
the
mere
fact
that
an
expert
witness
testifies
to
the
question
of
value,
his
grounds
for
a
court
on
a
sensitive
question
of
this
nature
simply
to
adopt
per
se
what
the
expert
says
and
to
end
the
case
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
we
have
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
that
the
court
has
taken
this
approach
on
any
matter.
we
have
split
decisions.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
well,
i
would
wonder
myself
if
to
accept
this
in
this
one
particular
case.
after
all,
extremely
important
and
sensitive
decisions
have
been
decided
by
this
court
by
the
margin
of
five
to
four,
the
roth
case
itself,
and
if
we
get
to
the
point
where
we
insist
that
a
--
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
decides
seven-to-nothing
or
this
court
decide
nine-to-nothing,
are
we
not
really
going
far
beyond
what
the
court
has
said
about
obscenity
being
protect
--
not
being
protected
from
the
first
amendment.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
experts.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
i
think
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
if
you
determine
that
the
testimony
that
has
been
given
by
the
experts
is
sound
testimony
and
this
all
was
done
by
the
trier
the
fact
and
this
--
it
would
be
appropriate
to
find
as
a
fact
that
the
book
had
value
and
not
within
the
case.
but
the
first
determination
that
must
be
made
is
whether
or
not
the
experts
have
put
it
into
the
record,
testimony
which
is
reasonable
and
believable
or
whether
they
have
simply
put
into
the
record
testimony
which
is
a
result
of
their
predetermination
that
the
state
should
not
have
the
power
to
prevent
a
person
from
reading
anything
which
is
a
predetermination
which
this
court
has
yet
to
accept.
the
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
exactly,
your
honor.
and
the
court
has
taken
this
responsibility
upon
itself.
members
of
this
court
have
indicated
that
those
would
be
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
i'm
afraid
so,
your
honor.
i
would
be
--
i
think
it's
unfortunate
but
i
would
have
to
impose
a
wholesale
reading
of
this
type
of
material
which
would
be
a
dreary
and
unlikely
job.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
oh,
no!
mr.
william
i.
cowin
no
your
honor,
but
(voice
overlap)
i
would
not
say
that
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
hear
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
to
read
all
of
this
material?
i'm
thinking
not
so
much
of
the
character
of
material
as
i
am
with
the
size
of
a
task
to
post.
the
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
if
--
as
long
as
we
are
to
have
a
position,
your
honor,
in
which
we
are
to
say
that
there
are
certain
things
of
the
state
or
the
federal
government
can
regulate
in
the
way
of
expression
which
this
court
has
said,
continues
to
say,
this
is
an
inevitable
result,
it
maybe
an
unpleasant
way
of
stating
that
the
supreme
court
has
become
a
court
of
nine
censors.
but
in
the
last
analysis,
as
mr.
justice
black
indicated
yesterday,
that
perhaps
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
a
man
is
to
go
to
jail
for
five
years,
does
ultimately
depend
upon
whether
or
not
this
court
find
social
value
on
what
he
post.
these
are
the
test
that
the
court
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
it
would
be
much
easier
for
attorneys
advising
clients
certainly.
the
--
but
as
long
as
the
court
has
the
test,
as
long
as
the
court
intends
them
to
be
applied
and
as
long
as
the
court
resists
the
position
that
the
first
amendment
is
to
become
absolute,
at
least
insofar
as
it's
applied
to
a
novel,
it
is
inevitable.
but
the
final
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
these
tests
are
applicable
is
going
to
have
to
be
made
by
the
court
of
last
resort.
the
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
i
would
say
that
considering
the
constitute
--
considering
the
particular
sensitive
constitutional
question
that
is
involved,
your
honor,
this
court
really
has
to
make
an
examination
of
its
own
as
to
whether
or
not
these
tests
have
been
properly
met.
now,
i
realize
that
it
would
be
very
easy
for
me
to
stand
up
here
and
say,
a
trial
court
in
boston
has
found
the
book
obscene.
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
has
affirmed
it
and
all
this
court
need
to
do
is
review
to
see
whether
or
not
there's
substantial
evidence
to
support
this.
but
this
is
not
a
position
that
the
court
has
adopted.
a
majority
of
the
court
has
indicated
that
it
is
the
duty,
the
responsibility
of
this
court
to
determine
in
each
case
because
the
right
to
think,
the
right
to
speak,
the
right
to
write
is
at
issue
here
and
i
am
hard
put
to
think
of
a
better
example
of
cases
in
which
the
united
states
supreme
court
should
be
called
upon
to
determine
whether
or
not
particular
obscenity
stand
has
been
appropriately
applied.
i
ask
not
that
the
courts
not
give
full
examination
to
these
obscenity
cases.
i
ask
only
that
the
courts
take
the
test
--
this
court
take
the
test
which
it
itself
has
developed
and
apply
them
in
a
reasonable
manner.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
the
court
can
of
course
--
of
course
taken
its
view
in
those
areas
and
could
conceivably
take
that
view
in
the
area
of
obscenity
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
--
although,
a
majority
of
the
courts
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
but
what
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
perhaps
greater
only
in
the
sense
of
the
deference
that
has
been
paid
to
what
by
a
majority
of
this
court
in
insisting
that
there'd
be
a
full
review.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
first
amendment,
although,
of
course
there
are
other
sections
of
the
constitution.
but
as
a
practical
question,
here,
the
court
has
the
book
before
it
as
a
readily
--
the
court
is
readily
able
to
examine
the
actual
material
that
is
in
question,
decide
whether
or
not
to
test
that
the
court
itself
has
developed
are
reasonably
applicable
to
the
book.
this
is
really
beyond
the
court
in
the
case
that
has
been
postulated
and
that
the
particular
witnesses
are
not
here.
here,
you
may
have
--
here
granted
you
have
a
transcript
of
testimony
of
witnesses,
but
you
also
have
the
very
thing
that
is
at
issue
which
can
be
read.
the
court
is
in
a
far
better
position
to
examine
the
material
more
or
less
in
the
first
instance
without
relying
upon
review
procedures
or
findings
that
have
been
made
before
it.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
i
would
respectfully
suggest,
your
honor
that
the
--
a
preferable
alternative
to
that
would
be
simply
to
say
that
we
will
no
longer
hold
writing
of
any
kind
to
obscene
for
the
reason
that
there
will
always
be
something
in
the
record
now
that
the
book
has
value.
this
is
the
nature
of
these
obscenity
cases.
they
are
becoming
battles
of
experts
and
as
soon
--
if
the
court
adopts
a
rule
of
law
which
says
that
the
appearance
of
some
value,
appearance
of
some
testimony
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
the
book
has
value
is
determined
that
the
court
in
light
of
its
ruling
that
the
material
to
be
suppressed
must
be
utterly
worthless
that
this
prevents
the
court
from
seeing
the
materials
utterly
worthless
then
nothing
can
ever
again
be
held
to
be
obscene.
if
this
is
the
position
that
the
court
is
to
take,
i
would
prefer
to
see
the
court
say
so
but
rather,
the
court
has
said,
has
not
said,
the
court
has
continued
to
hold,
obscenity
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
here
are
the
tests,
if
they
are
applicable,
the
state
may
suppress
the
book
and
yet
when
a
conviction
or
an
injunction
as
in
the
present
procedure
comes
up
here,
somehow,
the
court
seems
to
slip
the
tests
away
again
and
say
either
they
are
not
really
applicable
to
this
material
or
perhaps
we
shouldn't
have
them
at
all.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
there
was,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
i
think
that
having
determined
that
it
makes
a
contribution,
your
honor,
you
don't
even
get
to
the
question
of
prurient
interest.
the
roth
test
stated
two
--
the
roth
case
stated
two
tests
so-called
social
value
and
so-called
prurient
interest
and
yet
rejected
the
previous
concept
of
balance.
therefore,
i
think
we're
left
with
nothing
but
the
conclusion
of
the
test
must
be
applied
independently
and
having
--
have
the
book
passed
the
so-called
social
value
test,
i
believe
the
court
would
never
even
come
to
the
prurient
interest
question.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i'm
hard
to
put
to
find
history.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
i'm
hard
to
put
to
find
history,
your
honors.
that
term
is
ordinarily
understood
in
this
book
or
be
it
the
positions
that
may
have
been
taken
by
expert
witnesses
who
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
court
has
indicated
that
a
book
may
have
value
in
a
variety
of
ways.
it
may
have
literally
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
if
the
book
were
about
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
as
far
as
a
--
unfortunately,
your
honor,
the
judges
have
been
put
in
a
position
as
to
--
in
which
they
must
be
superior
since
they
are
the
court
of
last
resort.
but
as
a
question
of
who
is
to
be
the
expert,
if
the
book
is
about
preaching
or
if
the
book
is
about
law
or
if
the
book
is
about
medicine,
a
preacher,
a
lawyer
or
a
doctor
could
conceivably
qualify
as
an
expert.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
perhaps
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
perhaps
the
average
person
would
have
to
become
the
experts
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
ordinarily,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
i
would
say
that
the
--
that
ordinarily
people
who
are
familiar
with
the
literally
field
might
qualify
as
an
expert.
the
appellant
has
insisted
the
book
has
historical
value.
i
haven't
found
any
but
perhaps
a
historian,
a
history
professor
would
qualify.
if
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
tract
so
to
speak
of
the
mores
of
the
times,
perhaps
the
sociologist
or
someone
familiar,
i
suppose
this
is
another
aspect
of
history,
familiar
with
the
sociology
of
the
18th
century
would
qualify.
i
have
no
objection
to
having
experts
in
the
court.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
well
that
--
i'd
say
there
were
no
experts
in
that
inquiry,
your
honor,
because
then
we've
gone
away
from
social
value
which
is
a
test
that
i
believe
does
lend
itself
to
expert
testimony.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
these
are
two
separate
tests,
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
i
believe
so.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
because
that
--
because
your
honor,
this
is
--
would
be
following
an
approach
to
the
subject
which
this
court
has
rejected
over
the
past
nine
years.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
because
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
would
put
the
book
into
the
hands
of
a
more
or
less
legislative
determination
as
to
what
the
community
wants
and
does
not
want
--
mr.
william
i.
cowin
--
they
have
read
and
distributed.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
the
court
has
said
that
they
do
your
honor.
and
within
the
restricted
limits
of
what
is
defined
to
be
obscene.
if
we
could
do
away
with
the
social
value
test
as
perhaps
your
honor
has
recommended,
this
would
be
fine
that
the
social
value
test
as
it
is
delimiting
more
or
less,
creating
outer
limits
on
what
the
state
can
regulate.
but
as
long
as
we
have
it,
as
long
as
we
are
bound
to
follow
this
test
and
as
long
as
material
is
to
be
put
into
the
record
on
the
question
of
social
value,
i
would
much
prefer
the
court
to
see
the
courts
say,
let's
not
regulate
anymore.
let's
give
even
a
broader
meaning
to
the
first
amendment
then
to
hold
out
three
or
--
separate
tests
if
indeed
they
are
separate
and
say
apply
these
tests.
and
yet
after
the
tests
are
applied,
continually
draw
the
test
away
again
in
effect.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
on
the
superior
court,
your
honor,
there
are
in
excess
of
40.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
i
perhaps
know
half
of
them.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
not
a
chance,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
because
the
reactions
are
similar
to
the
material
were
simply
too
different.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
of
the
person.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
we
cannot
rely
on
--
we
cannot
rely
on
the
findings,
that
i
agree
with.
if
it
is
a
question,
can
we
rely
on
united
states
supreme
court
to
be
the
final
determining
factor
of
whether
or
not
the
test
have
been
met,
i
say
we
have
to.
this
is
the
court
of
last
resort.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
i
agree.
mr.
william
i.
cowin
thank
you.
