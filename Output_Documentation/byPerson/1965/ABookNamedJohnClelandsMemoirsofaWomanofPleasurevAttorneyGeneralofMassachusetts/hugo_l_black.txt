justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
you
need
an
expert
as
to
what
--
whether
or
not
it
has
social
value,
an
expert
in
that
field,
why
not
go
to
a
member
of
the
legislature?
(inaudible)
make
the
best
expert
here,
the
ones
that's
used
to
passing
on
those
kinds
of
policy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he's
an
expert
in
passing
on
whatever
--
reformative
law
have
redeeming
social
value.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
but
there's
a
policy
there,
the
question
of
policy.
and
i
would
think
no
one
would
be
better
qualified
to
do
that,
the
concepts
of
government,
than
the
members
of
the
legislative
body,
assuming
always
that
it
doesn't
violate
the
first
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
get
aside?
justice
hugo
l.
black
get
aside.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
that
limited
to
literary
value,
the
idea
of
great
social
value?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
--
excuse
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
who
do
you
think
is
qualified
to
be
an
expert
witness
in
this
field,
determining
the
social
value
of
something?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
would
you
pick
as
an
expert
to
determine
whether
the
book
has
social
value?
would
you
get
a
preacher,
a
minister,
philosopher,
a
lawyer,
a
doctor,
a
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
a
judge
be
superior
to
anybody
else
in
your
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it's
about
sex?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
where
the
problems
are.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
--
what
person
or
group
of
persons
do
you
think
can
qualify
as
experts
in
this
field
to
determine
this
test
in
this
kind
of
a
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anybody?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
would
it
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
have
some
wonder
about
myself
as
to
whether
they
--
it
can
create
--
do
any
good
here.
let's
get
to
the
core
of
it.
the
core
of
the
test
is
that
it
aroused
or
stimulate
a
prurient
interest.
who
were
the
experts
in
that
field?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
recognize
that
that's
the
test
to
the
roth
case,
don't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
wholly
separate
in
the
stand?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
know.
the
social
value
of
the
book
does
that,
who
can
be
the
expert
on
it?
how
can
this
be
submitted
to
experts?
why
don't
you
have
to
have
if
you're
going
to
have
them,
some
kind
of
board
of
census
who
do
nothing
else
and
let
them
sweep
out
the
books
they
don't
like
or
let
those
be
printed
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
you
are
discussing
a
question
now
basically,
you're
discussing
it
basically.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
that's
where
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
should
be
in
the
legislative
volumes,
if
the
states
have
the
power
to
suppress
books
that
they
think
are
obscene.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
there's
much
force
in
your
argument.
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
question
now
about
the
findings
of
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
judges
you
have
in
boston?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
do
you
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
we
can
reasonably
expect
to
get
to
the
same
kind
if
we're
going
to
rely
on
findings
to
get
the
same
kind
of
findings
of
all
of
those
40
judges?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
reaction
of
the
person?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
individual
persons?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
how
can
we
rely?
how
can
we
adopt
the
test
that
makes
us
rely
on
the
findings
of
the
judges
when
we
know
the
likelihood
there's
no
two
of
them
who
would
say
they
are
likely?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
think
you're
right
in
that.
but
the
problem
still
arises
as
to
how
the
courts
are
going
to
do
all
the
censorship
and
do
anything
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
whether
it's
the
right
one
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
anybody
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
roth
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
the
court
held,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
the
court
held,
isn't
it?
instead
of
saying
that
the
first
amendment
was
not
absolute,
the
court
didn't
say
that.
what
the
court
said
was
as
i
read
its
opinion
from
the
point
to
which
you
refer?
what
it
said
was,
that
the
certain
types
of
language
that
are
not
included
in
the
words
“speech”
and
“press”.
but
there
are
certain
things
that
are
not
that
was
said
by
mr.
justice
murphy
first,
largely,
in
the
case
where
the
only
thing
it
happened
was
some
invictus
and
bad
language
were
used
on
the
street
to
provoke
a
fight.
but
the
--
the
roth
test,
as
i
understood
it,
was
that
if
the
book
aroused
prurient
interest
or
could
arouse
prurient
interest,
it
was
--
it
was
alright
to
censor
it
and
stop
its
publications.
do
you
say
this
book
doesn't
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
it
does
or
doesn't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh!
well,
that
--
that
gets
back
to
the
definition
of
the
word
prurient.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
the
court
is
an
expert?
