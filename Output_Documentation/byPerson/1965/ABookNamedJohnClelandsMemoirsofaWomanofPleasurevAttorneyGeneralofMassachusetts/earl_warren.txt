chief

we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
pleasure‚Äù,
appellant,
versus
attorney
general
of
massachusetts.
mr.
rembar
have
you
completed
your
opening
argument
or
do
you
wish
to
proceed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
--
you
may
file
such
brief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
promptly
if
--
as
promptly
as
you
can
--
as
promptly
as
you
can,
mr.
rembar.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
mr.
cowin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
reliance
does
the
court
could
entitle
to
place
on
the
--
on
the
courts
or
judgment
of
the
courts
below
in
this
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
another
--
in
other
fields,
don't
we
very
often
take
the
finding
of
fact
to
the
lower
court
in
situations
that
involved
even
the
life
of
a
man.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
have
--
we
have
a
murder
case,
for
instance,
and
the
man
claims
that
the
confession
that
they
took
was
involuntary,
that
he
was
coerced
into
it.
it's
true
that
we
say
that
--
that
we
are
not
bound
by
the
finding
of
the
court
below
and
that
we
have
the
right
and
we
sometimes
do
review
it
and
make
our
own
judgment
but
is
the
court
obliged
to
do
that?
can
it
not
in
this
case
as
we
often
do
in
coerced
confession
cases
take
the
view
that
the
evidence
was
conflicting
and
that
the
court
below
found
that
it
was
a
voluntary
confession?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
shouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
my
point
is,
why
shouldn't
it
if
we
can
do
it
where
a
man's
life
is
involved
and
where
he
may
have
been
--
been
beaten
and
tortured
as
they
often
claim
in
such
cases?
if
we
can
do
it
there
and
let
the
man
go
to
his
death,
why
couldn't
we
do
it
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
know
that
this
constitutional
right
is
any
greater
than
the
--
than
the
one
we're
dealing
with
in
the
coerced
confession.
chief
justice

mr.

mr.
rembar.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
make
a
distinction
between
obscenity
that
is
addressed
only
in
crude
writing
from
obscenity
that
is
addressed
in
--
in
the
skillful
writing
and
perhaps
colorful
writing,
it
would
in
and
of
itself
appeal
to
people?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know.
we're
trying
to
find
out
what
it
means.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
and
it
would
make
no
difference
to
you
then
whether
it
was
dressed
up
in
crude
language
or
in
very
skillful
and
learned
language?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
it
is
--
it
is
basically
obscene,
why
would
it
make
any
difference?
what
kind
of
dressing
it
had
on
in
order
to
appeal
to
the
public?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
not
--
that's
what
we're
trying
to
determine,
whether
it's
quality
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i'm
talking
about
--
about
the
things
that
are
admittedly
obscene.
do
you
think
that
it
makes
any
difference
whether
it
is
dressed
up
in
skillful
language
as
i
said
before
or
whether
it's
crude
and
even
vulgar
language?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
