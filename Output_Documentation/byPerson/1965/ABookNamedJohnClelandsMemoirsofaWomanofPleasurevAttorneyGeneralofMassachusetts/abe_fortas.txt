justice
abe
fortas
mr.
cowin,
suppose
you
had
a
novel
which
let
us
assume
contain
a
valuable
representation
of
the
life
and
times
of
england
in
the
17th
century
or
whatever
and
let
us
suppose
that
it
is
well-written
so
that
it
is
--
and
so
recognized
by
persons
qualified
to
make
the
judgment.
it's
a
good
novel.
it's
a
historical
novel.
it
contributes,
if
you
will
assume,
indulge
me
in
that
assumption
too,
it
contributes
to
an
understanding
of
life
and
times
in
that
historical
period.
let
us
also
assume
that
it
does
appeal
to
a
prurient
interest.
now,
how
would
you
feel
about
that
under
our
test?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
so
that
on
the
assumptions
that
i
stated
which
may
or
may
not
be
applicable
here,
the
assumptions
that
i
stated
--
you
would
agree
that
it
is
not
obscene
within
the
roth
test.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
--
and
your
point
here
is
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
since
you
have
invited
this
court
to
review
the
book
itself,
your
point,
i
assume,
is
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
book
is
not
to
be
considered
as
a
historical
novel
within
the
classification
that
i
stated
in
my
hypothetical
question.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rembar,
you
did
not
introduce
any
evidence
on
any
subject.
did
you,
except
the
literary
value?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
as
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
referred
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
point
came
to
mind
because
a
few
moments
ago,
you
referred
to
the
phrase
“prurient
interest”
in
terms
of
appeal
to
--
prurient
appeal
to
a
person
having
normal,
healthy
responses
or
whatever
they
may
be
but
you
made
no
effort
to
--
and
used
testimony
addressed
to
that
point,
did
you?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
relied
so
far
as
your
testimony
was
concerned
as
i
understand
it
solely
on
the
proposition
that
because
this
is
in
your
submission,
a
kind
of
literary
work,
it
has
redeeming
social
value.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
a
fair
characterization
in
your
case?
