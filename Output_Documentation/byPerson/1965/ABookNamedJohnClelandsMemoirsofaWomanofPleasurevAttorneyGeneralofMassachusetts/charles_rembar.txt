mr.
charles
rembar
may
it
please
--
mr.
charles
rembar
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
which
held
that
this
book
was
not
entitled
to
constitutional
protection
by
a
four-to-three
votes.
i'm
happy
to
say
mr.
chief
justice
that
i
bring
you
a
case
in
which
is
not
necessary
to
read
the
book.
it's
not
that
we
don't
want
you
to
read
the
book,
we
urge
you
to
read
the
book.
we
think
it's
a
good
book.
we
do
not
think
it
will
adversely
affect
your
moral
fiber.
we
do
not
think
that
you
will
find
it
deeply
offensive.
although
if
the
members
of
this
busy
court
have
not
had
time
to
keep
up
with
the
bestseller
lists,
you
may
find
the
subject
matter
a
bit
unusual.
and
on
the
matter
of
redeeming
social
importance
--
mr.
charles
rembar
in
this
way,
your
honor,
all
counsel
here
--
mr.
charles
rembar
i
don't
think
your
time
was
wasted,
your
honor.
i
think,
as
i
say
that
it
is
a
book
which
has
many
values
to
offer
to
the
reader.
mr.
charles
rembar
very
good,
your
honor.
i
will
say
this
though,
if
i
may
help
the
chief
justice
first.
the
--
we
have
here
a
record
in
which
there
is
an
overwhelming
demonstration
of
the
kind
of
value
that
all
counsel
here
today
agreed,
invokes
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
i
would
suggest
that
a
possible
answer
to
the
administrative
difficulty
that
the
chief
justice
has
outlined
is
that
where
you
have
highly
qualified
witnesses
who
come
to
court
and
stake
their
professional
reputations
on
their
analysis
of
the
book
and
its
values
where
you
have
published
reviews
and
critical
essays
by
people
who
have
no
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
litigation,
which
also
established
that
value.
then
on
the
record,
the
book
is
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
charles
rembar
the
majority
below,
your
honor,
did
not
accept
the
test
of
redeeming
social
importance.
they
referred
to
it
as
one
other
possible
test.
it
obviously
made
very
small
impression
on
them.
and
then
they
committed
an
error
which
i
believe
this
court
will
find
to
be
an
error
on
the
basis
of
the
record.
they
said
the
book
has
only
minimal
literary
value.
now,
this
court
of
course
while
--
mr.
charles
rembar
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
the
contrary,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is
this.
you
do
not
accept
the
conclusion
of
the
so-called
expert.
he
doesn't
merely
get
up
there
and
say,
"this
book
has
value"
and
leave
the
court,
and
there
can
be
testimony
on
the
other
side
as
well.
it
is
for
this
court
to
read
the
record,
to
appraise
the
testimony,
and
to
decide
whether
really
a
case
has
been
made
out
for
social
value.
the
witnesses
in
this
case
didn't
make
conclusory
statements.
they
analyzed
the
book.
they
spoke
of
the
various
canons
of
literary
criticism
that
are
to
be
applied.
they
found
the
book
good
under
those
canons.
now,
in
opposition
there
was
one
witness,
and
we
would
leave
to
the
court
the
appraisal
of
his
testimony
as
well.
he
was
a
witness
who
spoke
in
conclusory
terms.
he
called
the
book
obscene
and
prurient.
he
said
that
prurient
meant
esoteric.
when
asked
if
that
was
really
the
word
he
meant,
he
said
yes.
when
he
was
asked
who
it
was
that
the
heroine
had
married
at
the
end
of
the
book,
he
couldn't
remember.
he
referred
to
jane
austen
as
an
18th
century
novelist.
while
all
of
these
things
can
be
considered,
at
the
same
time
the
court
can
consider
the
qualifications
and
the
statements
of
professor
fred
stocking,
chairman
of
the
department
of
literature
of
williams
college,
professor
john
bullitt
professor
of
english
and
master
of
quincy
house
at
harvard,
professor
holland
of
mit,
professor
sproat
of
boston
university
and
the
rest
of
the
witnesses.
mr.
charles
rembar
i
submit
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
rembar
well,
your
honor
says
no
matter
how
many
people
disagree
with
them,
i
would
ask
in
court
or
out
of
court?
mr.
charles
rembar
witnesses,
if
there
is
a
substantial
body
of
expert
testimony
that
says
this
book
is
utterly
without
value,
then
this
court
will
make
up
its
mind
on
the
basis
of
that
record
just
as
it
does
in
other
cases
where
there
are
disputes.
mr.
charles
rembar
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
is
what
the
test
will
be.
but
in
applying
that
test,
you
will
have
to
consider
the
testimony
on
both
sides
of
the
case.
it's
conceivable
that
you
have
to
--
mr.
charles
rembar
the
baptist
minister,
i
think,
your
honor
would
not
be
qualified
to
give
literary
testimony.
he
might
testify
as
to
the
religious
value
of
the
work.
mr.
charles
rembar
but
i
would
say
in
--
mr.
charles
rembar
scientific,
artistic
--
this
court
has
mentioned
those
aspects
and
--
mr.
charles
rembar
he
might
if
the
value
of
the
book
were
urged
to
be
--
mr.
charles
rembar
then
it
has
a
medical
or
a
psychiatric
value.
mr.
charles
rembar
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
constitute
that
kind
of
value.
but
if
i
may
return
to
your
question
--
mr.
charles
rembar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
rembar
i
am
saying
that.
mr.
charles
rembar
your
honor,
the
word
pornography
--
mr.
charles
rembar
if
by
pornographic,
your
honor
means,
sexually
arousing
or
lustable,
in
terms
of
decisions,
the
answer
is
yes.
i
think
it
has
been
clear
for
some
time
now
that
material
whose
effect
is
to
stimulate
a
sexual
response
in
the
normal
person
is
not
for
that
reason
to
be
denounced.
i
think
that
sexual
--
mr.
charles
rembar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
rembar
because
he's
not
an
expert
in
that
field,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
rembar
but
here,
the
assertion
is
not
that
the
book
has
value
as
legislation.
it's
that
it
has
value
as
a
book.
mr.
charles
rembar
mr.
justice
black,
suppose
what
was
urged
was
not
that
it
had
literary
value
but
that
it
had
scientific
value,
that
it
has
great
value
in
expounding
the
point.
mr.
charles
rembar
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
rembar
yes,
and
if
what
is
urged
is
literary
value,
get
people
who
know
about
literature.
mr.
charles
rembar
not
at
all,
your
honor.
it
can
be
many
things.
in
this
case
we
say
there
is
literary
value
and
we
say
there
is
historical
value.
in
other
cases,
it
might
be
another
kind
of
value.
it
might
be
the
kind
of
value
that
mr.
justice
douglas
adverted
to,
a
value
in
helping
psychiatric
measures
or
counseling.
there
can
be
many
kinds
of
value.
mr.
charles
rembar
there
are
--
as
elements
of
literary
value,
good
writing
with
observations
of
human
nature,
psychological
insights,
the
drawing
of
character,
the
impression
on
the
reader
that
there
were
real
people
involved
in
this.
all
these
things
have
literary
value.
mr.
charles
rembar
well
and
powerfully,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
rembar
but
the
reason
i
was
that
detailed
in
answering
your
question
is
that
we
have
encountered
the
argument
that
merely
a
good
style
is
not
enough.
and
i
want
to
say
that
here
we
have
much
more
than
a
good
style.
i'd
like
to
return
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question.
if
--
if
there
is
a
substantial
body
of
expert
opinion
that
finds
value,
then
i
say
the
book
is
entitled
to
the
first
amendment
protection.
it
does
--
mr.
charles
rembar
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
am
not
saying
that
if
one
witness
comes
in
and
says
it's
a
good
book
that
that
automatically
answers
the
question.
mr.
charles
rembar
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
the
necessary
implication.
mr.
charles
rembar
well,
two
of
the
tests
from
roth.
the
patent
offensiveness
test
does
not
have
a
substantial
backing,
because
the
roth
opinion
was
a
majority
opinion.
and
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
harlan
in
which
the
patent
offensiveness
test
was
enunciated
was
not
a
majority
opinion.
but
i
think
it
is
also
true
that
the
patent
offensiveness
test
represents
one
branch
of
the
prurient
interest
test
as
set
forth
in
roth.
that
is
there
is
in
addition
to
the
kind
of
morbid
and
unhealthy
appeal
to
a
certain
kind
of
sexual
response,
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
the
idea
of
going
substantially
beyond
customary
candor,
which
i
think
is
very
close
to
the
patent
offensiveness
test
as
mr.
justice
harlan
stated
it.
mr.
charles
rembar
'49,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
rembar
it
would
show
enough
of
it
your
honor.
there
was
a
testimony
here
that
the
book
has
historical
value
in
two
ways.
one
is
that
it
informed
an
important
part
of
the
development
of
the
novel.
it
came
in
that
decade
in
which
the
novel
as
an
english
literary
form
was
created.
the
other
is
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
material
in
the
book
about
manners
and
customs
at
the
time.
mr.
charles
rembar
there
is
in
our
brief,
mr.
justice
douglas,
a
material
showing
that
there
is
a
rather
acute
parallel
between
the
events
related
in
this
book
and
the
events
related
in
the
newspapers
at
just
about
the
time
this
book
was
published
in
connection
with
the
pro
forma
affair
in
great
britain.
mr.
charles
rembar
there's
been
--
mr.
charles
rembar
i
don't
know
the
current
status
your
honor.
there
was
a
trial
in
which
the
judge,
the
magistrate,
held
the
book
obscene
and
there
was
no
appeal.
i
don't
know
what
the
situation
is
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
that
magistrate.
mr.
charles
rembar
that's
exactly
it.
those
are
--
mr.
charles
rembar
--
the
two
states
in
which
the
cases
reached
the
highest
court.
there
was
a
trial
in
new
jersey
which
held
against
the
book
and
the
appeal
there
has
been
held
in
advance
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
mention
the
brief
amicus
that
was
filed
without
consent
of
the
parties
but
with
the
permission
of
the
court.
that
brief
deserves
special
mention
because
i
think
it
represents
more
truly
than
the
brief
of
the
attorney
general,
the
nature
of
the
opposition
to
this
book.
the
brief
proceeds
from
curll's
case.
it
cites
that
case
eight
times.
curll's
case
was
decided
in
the
first
year
of
the
reign
of
george
ii.
curll
was
a
rather
rambunctious
publisher
who
was
held
into
court
for
two
things
he
published.
one
was
a
book
that
the
government
felt
--
brought
the
government
into
disrepute.
the
other
was
a
book
that
the
government
felt
was
obscene.
the
court
in
the
obscenity
case
decided
that
obscenity
was
a
common
law
crime
and
they
decided
it
on
this
basis.
they
accepted
the
argument
of
the
attorney
general
there
that
a
breach
of
the
king's
peace
is
a
common
law
of
crime.
that
a
breach
of
the
king's
peace
can
come
from
writing
and
he
said
it
comes
from
three
kinds
of
writing
--
writing
that
tends
to
bring
the
government
into
disrepute,
writing
that
tends
to
go
against
religion,
and
writing
that
tends
to
go
against
morality.
the
court
agreed
with
him
on
all
three.
now,
i
think
this
is
extremely
important
because
it
shows
exactly
what
the
kind
of
opposition
to
publication
is
that
is
found
in
the
anti-obscenity
laws.
mr.
charles
rembar
books
on
religion
would
be
bad
under
this
test.
but
what
i
wish
to
point
out,
your
honor,
is
that
when
the
first
amendment
was
adopted,
all
three
aspects
of
this
opposition
were
rejected.
they
came
as
a
package
and
they
were
rejected
as
a
package.
mr.
charles
rembar
a
--
the
author
himself
was
not
prosecuted.
the
bookseller
later
was
prosecuted
but
it
appears
that
the
book
was
not
an
authentic
copy
of
the
original.
this
book
throughout
its
history
has
had
sort
of
a
reverse
bowdlerizing.
people
have
added
things
rather
than
taking
them
out.
they've
added
illustrations
for
example
and
an
illustration
formed
the
basis
of
a
case
in
1821
in
massachusetts
in
which
a
defendant
named
holmes
was
convicted.
i
want
to
say
one
more
thing
on
a
question
that
was
asked
previously
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
state
and
federal
question.
i
want
to
call
to
the
court's
attention,
certain
practical
considerations
that
should
affect
the
legal
conclusion.
an
author
lives
in
one
state,
a
publisher
publishes
in
another.
the
book
is
printed
and
bound
in
a
third
and
it's
distributed
by
wholesalers
everywhere.
none
of
these
people
observe
state
lines.
in
new
jersey,
there
was
a
stipulation
that
the
book
was
would
not
be
distributed
during
the
pendency
of
the
case.
some
books
got
into
campton
because
the
philadelphia
wholesaler
covers
south
jersey.
it
is
just
not
consonant
with
the
realities
of
modern
publishing
to
attempt
a
state-by-state
censorship.
it
--
we
cannot
have
some
states
in
which
a
book
is
published
and
others
in
which
it
is
not.
a
publisher
cannot
gauge
his
ability
to
publish
which
comes
down
to
a
matter
of
money
in
that
way.
i
would
say
that
this
nation
cannot
exist
half-censored
and
half-free.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
rembar
i
had
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
save
the
remaining
time
for
reply.
i
would
like
also
at
this
time
to
ask
the
court's
permission
to
file
a
short
reply
brief
to
the
brief
amicus,
which
was
filed
without
our
consent
and
too
late
for
us
to
deal
with
prior
to
the
argument.
mr.
charles
rembar
thank
you.
mr.
charles
rembar
within
a
week.
mr.
charles
rembar
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
my
brother
has
stated
not
the
position
that
we've
taken
but
the
position
that
he
wishes
we
had
taken.
we
do
not
say
that
any
book
can
now
be
published
under
these
tests.
under
the
tests
that
mr.
justice
black
has
in
mind,
that
would
be
so.
under
the
test
that
this
court
has
thus
far
enunciated,
it
is
not
so.
we
do
say
that
this
book
before
the
court
now
is
well
within
the
protection
of
the
amendment
under
the
tests
as
they
now
stand.
mr.
charles
rembar
yes,
your
honor.
the
roth
case
and
here
i
believe
my
brother
and
i
are
in
complete
agreement
actually
set
forth
two
tests.
one
was
a
heritage
of
those
cases
which
had
been
decided
under
the
anti-obscenity
statutes
before
they
were
ever
considered
in
the
constitutional
context
and
that
was
the
prurient
interest
test
which
was
a
narrower,
more
rigorous
definition
of
the
kind
of
material
that
those
statutes
could
deal
with.
that
is
it
moved
from
the
old
hicklin
idea
of
anything
which
arouses
lust
to
the
kind
of
thing
which
is
morbid
and
unhealthy
in
its
appeal.
but
in
addition,
since
the
first
amendment
was
now
involved,
there
had
to
be
some
justification
for
giving
these
anti-obscenity
statutes
any
scope.
after
all
a
book
is
pure
expression.
there's
no
conduct
involved,
except
perhaps
on
the
part
of
the
person
who
sells
it,
but
when
we're
considering
the
book
itself,
there
are
simply
expression.
how
then
can
it
be
said
that
it
is
not
speech
or
press?
mr.
charles
rembar
they
held
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
rembar
we
say
it
doesn't
do
that,
but
we
say
there's
another
even
more
important.
mr.
charles
rembar
it
does
not
arouse
prurient
interest
as
they're
defined.
we
say
that
a
book
about
which
the
words
that
can
be
said
that
stimulates
a
normal
sexual
response
in
the
healthy
adult
is
not
prurient
within
the
meaning
--
mr.
charles
rembar
yes,
sir.
but
i
wish
to
go
beyond
that
because
apparently,
your
honor,
and
i
differ
on
what
there
is
in
the
rest
of
the
majority
opinion
in
roth.
the
majority
undertook
to
justify
these
anti-obscenity
statutes
and
so
it
said,
how
was
is
it
--
how
is
it
that
we
can
deal
with
obscenity
that
we
can
allow
the
legislatures
to
deal
with
obscenity?
and
they
said,
because
obscenity
is
material
utterly
without
redeeming
social
importance.
the
court
therefore
necessarily
in
justifying
the
statutes
defined
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
statutes
could
deal
with.
it
is
reasonable
to
say
that
it
is
not
really
speech
or
press
if
it's
just
worthless
trash
that
something
that
really
has
no
value
may
perhaps
be
reached
by
these
statutes.
now,
my
brother
has
said
that
if
you
hold
with
me,
there's
nothing
that
these
statutes
can
reach.
well,
i
say
that
that
is
utterly
unrealistic.
this
court
has
had
before
it
on
petitions
for
certiorari
publications
as
to
which
no
claim
of
social
value
was
made.
it
is
inconceivable
that
witnesses
of
the
caliber
of
those
which
appeared
to
say
that
this
book
has
value
could
have
testified
there's
other
material
and
these
other
cases
had
value.
mr.
charles
rembar
yes
sir.
it
is
our
position
that
--
no
one
is
an
expert
on
the
question
of
prurient
interest,
that's
the
question
for
the
court.
mr.
charles
rembar
it's
a
legal
question,
your
honor,
and
therefore
the
courts
are
necessarily
experts.
mr.
charles
rembar
no
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
rembar
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
rembar
exactly.
mr.
charles
rembar
mr.
chief
justice,
the
word
obscenity
has
a
number
of
meanings
as
you
know.
mr.
charles
rembar
in
--
in
its
constitutional
meaning
which
i
think
is
what
we're
concerned
with.
mr.
charles
rembar
it
means
the
kind
of
material
that
can
be
constitutionally
suppressed
and
we
say
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
if
it
has
value,
literary
value
or
some
other
type
of
value,
then
it
cannot
be
obscenity.
there
is
no
such
thing
in
our
opinion
as
valuable
obscenity.
obscenity
is
worthless
trash,
that's
its
definition
constitutionally.
mr.
charles
rembar
if
it
were
skillful
and
learned,
not
your
honor,
if
it
were
really
a
work
of
consequence,
then
it
would
make
a
great
difference
because
then
i
would
say
in
constitutional
terms,
it
is
not
obscene.
mr.
charles
rembar
if
i
may
say
so
your
honor,
the
word
dressing
is
pejorative
here.
mr.
charles
rembar
pejorative,
it
means
the
quality
of
the
work,
if
it
is
a
work
of
real
quality.
mr.
charles
rembar
i
do
say
though
--
mr.
charles
rembar
i
think
that
crudity
and
vulgarity
do
play
a
part
here.
i
think
they
have
a
great
deal
to
do
with
what
we
can
consider
either
one-half
the
prurient
interest
test
or
the
patent
offensiveness
test.
mr.
charles
rembar
i
think
that
kind
of
element
is
certainly
pertinent
to
the
decision.
mr.
charles
rembar
this
court
has
passed
on
a
book
which
is
in
the
opinion
of
most
people
crude
and
vulgar
in
the
extreme,
that's
‘tropic
of
cancer'
but
it
is
a
book
which
is
generally
agreed
has
considerable
literary
value.
if
the
book
has
not
that
value,
and
is
crude
and
vulgar,
and
makes
the
kind
of
morbid
appeal
that
we
say
the
prurient
test
envisages,
then
it
is
obscene
and
only
then.
mr.
charles
rembar
you
did,
your
honor.
it
was
a
case
in
which
four
justices
voted
not
to
grant
certiorari,
the
other
five
voted
to
grant
it
and
upheld
the
book
on
the
basis
of
the
opinions
in
the
jacobellis
case.
mr.
charles
rembar
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
rembar
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
rembar
that's
right.
mr.
charles
rembar
you
have
the
responsibility,
your
honor.
your
expertise
is
on
the
law,
in
making
that
judgment,
what
i
suggested
yesterday
--
mr.
charles
rembar
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
you
have
the
record
to
help
you.
the
--
we
--
i
said
in
this
case
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
go
beyond
the
record
because
the
record
itself
is
so
persuasive
but
that
does
not
mean
that
if
the
record
were
not
more
conflicting,
you
should
not
go
to
the
book.
mr.
charles
rembar
and
one
final
point
is
this,
my
brother
here
cast
out
on
the
objectivity
of
the
witnesses.
i
think
that
this
is
utterly
unrealistic
and
i
would
point
further
to
the
fact
that
there's
also
in
the
record,
the
published
reviews
of
eminent
people
who
had
no
interest
whatever
in
this
litigation.
thank
you.
