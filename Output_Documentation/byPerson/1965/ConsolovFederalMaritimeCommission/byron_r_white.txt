mr.
boyer,
what's
left
for
the
shipper's
action
in
the
district
court
under
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
are
the
issues
then
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
i
would
have
supposed
under
your
position,
all
of
the
glosses
used
would
be
determined
in
the
review
proceeding.
i
gather
that
hypothetically
that
your
position
is
that
the
shipper
would
have
in
the
first
instance
to
initiate
a
review
proceeding
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
shipper
has
a
reparation
to
it
and
it
hasn't
been
--
the
reparations
have
not
been
paid,
now
if
i
understood
what
you
have
just
said
to
justice
fortas,
it
is
that
in
that
instance,
the
shipper
is
not
paid.
he
cannot
go
into
a
district
court
proceeding
but
has
to
initiate
a
review
proceeding,
did
i
correctly
understand?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
see.
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
shipper
in
the
instance
--
in
that
instance
could
go
into
the
district
court,
could
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
it's
where
he
hasn't
had
from
the
commission
all
he
thinks
he
should
have
and
he
wants
more
that
you're
suggesting
has
first
to
go
in
the
reviews.
