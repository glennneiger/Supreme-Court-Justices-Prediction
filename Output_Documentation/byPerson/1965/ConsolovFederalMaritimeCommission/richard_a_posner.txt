mr.
richard
a.
posner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
take
my
three
minutes
this
afternoon
to
try
to
clarify
this
question
of
the
status
of
the
reparations
order
in
the
enforcement
action.
it
is
not
a
piece
of
evidence
in
that
enforcement
action
to
be
put
in
with
a
mass
of
other
evidence.
insofar
as
issues
are
involved
in
the
reparations
proceeding
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
commission,
the
reparations
order
is
final
and
there
can
be
no
new
evidence
or
reexamination
de
novo
in
the
section
16
(2)
enforcement
--
or,
in
this
context,
section
30
enforcement
action,
by
the
same
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
and
i
think
it's
true
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
i
think
it's
the
same
kind
of
jurisdiction
that
this
court
was
compelled
to
draw
in
the
early
primary
jurisdiction
cases
with
respect
to
direct
actions
between
shipper
and
carrier
under
section
9
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
that
requires--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
it
seems
to
me
that
the
primary
jurisdiction
principle
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
issue.
in
order
to
collect
reparations,
you'd
have
to
establish
a
violation
of
the
shipping
act,
and
questions
of
violation
are
for
the
agency
to
decide.
and
once
they
have
been
decided,
a
district
court
can't
take
additional
evidence,
a
jury
couldn't
reexamine
the
question
de
novo.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
it
is
fully
reviewable
in
our
view
in
the
shipper's
section
30
enforcement
action.
there,
the
carrier
can
get
the
same
kind
of
review,
he
could,
could
he
challenge
it.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
is
--
that
would
be
also
true
in
a
court
of
appeals
action.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no.
insofar
as
the
commission's
reparations
order
depends,
as
it
must
depend
on
a
finding
that
the
carrier
violated
the
shipping
act,
this
is
a
determination
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
agency
and
there
cannot
be
additional
evidence
introduced
in
a
district
court
action.
that's
the
fundamental
principle
of
primary
jurisdiction.
now,
there
might
be
some
residual
questions
in
an
enforcement
action
having
to
do
purely
with
a
computation
of
damages
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
--
where
supplementary
evidence
might
be
appropriate.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
the
court
will
bear
with
me
briefly,
i'll
try
to
restate
the
government's
position
on
the
jurisdictional
issue
here
in
such
a
way
as
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
members
have
put
--
had
yesterday
and
were
left
unresolved
at
the
recess.
we're
trying
to
make
sense
here
of
a
statutory
pattern,
a
network
of
interrelated
statutory
provisions
in
the
shipping
act.
now,
putting
aside
for
a
moment
the
question
of
the
bearing,
if
any
of
the
hobbs
act
on
this
question,
the
pattern
here
is
the
same
as
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
issue
discussed
in
the
atlantic
case
yesterday.
now
review
briefly,
the
salient
features
of
this
statutory
pattern
in
the
shipping
act.
first,
section
22
provides
that
any
person
may
file
with
the
commission
a
complaint
against
the
carrier
and
if
the
carrier
doesn't
satisfy
the
complaint
than
after
the
usual
administrative
proceedings
and
hearing,
the
commission
can
issue
an
order
and
it
can
issue
orders
of
two
types.
on
the
one
hand,
it
can
make
an
order
prospect
of
an
effect,
a
prescriptive,
or
injunctive
or
declaratory
order,
regulating
the
carrier's
practices
for
the
future.
and
on
the
other
hand,
it
can
issue
a
damages
order
that
is
a
reparations
order
directing
the
carrier
to
pay,
to
make
a
money
payment
to
the
shipper
to
make
him
hold
for
the
damages
that
he
suffered
as
a
result
of
an
unlawful
act
by
the
carrier.
the
next
section,
i
want
to
mention
is
section
31
of
the
act
which
provides
that
the
venue
and
procedure
and
actions
to
enforce,
set
aside
or
suspend
orders
of
the
maritime
commission
shall
be
the
same
as
in
similar
actions
involving
icc
orders.
this
section
incorporates
by
reference
the
urgent
deficiencies
act
which
is
now
codified
in
section
1336,
the
judicial
code,
which
empowers
the
district
courts
to
set
aside
orders
of
the
maritime
commission
at
the
behest
of
the
carrier
and
these
review
proceedings
are
brought
against
the
commission
of
the
united
states.
now,
on
its
face
of
section
31
would
seem
to
embrace
and
make
reviewable
in
these
actions
against
the
commission
of
the
united
states,
both
kinds
of
orders
under
section
22,
both
the
prescriptive,
injunctive
type
orders
and
the
reparations
orders.
we
think
that
section
31
should
not
be
so
construed,
however,
and
we
rely
for
this
distinction
in
result
on
two
further
sections
of
the
shipping
act,
sections
29
and
30.
and
their
interrelation
is
really
the
core
of
this
case.
under
section
29,
the
commission
and
the
attorney
general
as
well
as
the
charging
party
is
empowered
to
bring
federal
district
court
proceedings
to
enforce
orders
of
the
maritime
commission.
but
not
all
orders,
only
those
orders
prescriptive
or
injunctive
in
effect,
our
orders
for
the
payment
of
money
that
is
reparations
orders
are
expressly
excluded.
the
procedure
for
enforcing
reparations
orders
is
different.
it
is
set
forth
in
section
30.
this
enforcement
action
provided
for
by
section
30
is
one
brought
by
the
shipper
against
the
carrier.
the
maritime
commission
or
the
attorney
general
are
not
parties,
have
no
power
to
enforce
such
orders.
moreover,
in
the
shipper's
enforcement
action,
the
shipper
has
been
given
distinct
procedural
advantages,
a
wide
choice
of
form,
freedom
from
costs
and
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
if
he
prevails.
there
is
no
counter
part
in
section
29
relating
to
the
enforcement
of
non-reparations
order
to
these
procedural
advantages
in
section
30.
now
why
did
congress
make
a
distinction
in
the
enforcement
mechanism
for
non-reparations
and
reparations
orders?
why
the
first
enforceable
by
the
--
by
the
government
but
not
the
second
and
why
does
the
shipper
enjoy
special
advantages
in
his
enforcement
suit
of
reparations
orders?
the
answer
we
think
has
to
do
with
a
limited
public
interest
in
a
reparations
proceeding.
if
the
commission
issues
an
order
prescribing
a
rate,
that's
an
order
that
governs
the
relationship
between
the
carrier
and
the
shippers
--
and
all
shippers
for
the
future.
if
on
the
other
hand,
it
goes
on
to
award
the
shipper
damages
for
the
past
misconduct
of
the
carrier
for
the
unjust
rate
say
that
the
carrier
charged.
this
is
just
an
adjustment
between
shipper
and
carrier,
an
assessment
of
damages
and
the
process
of
assessing
damages
is
one
traditionally
left
to
private
litigation
and
so
here
to
a
shipper's
enforcement
suit
in
which
the
government
plays
no
role.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
depends.
very
often
in
reparations
case,
involving
say
an
overcharge
under
a
tariff,
the
tariff
or
the
rate
is
no
longer
in
existence.
now
in
other
cases,
the
rate
or
tariff
that's
found
unlawful
is
continuing.
but
in
a
case
like
that,
the
maritime
commission
or
the
interstate
commerce
commission
will
issue
two
orders.
the
one
prescribing
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
which
the
carrier
is
required
to
charge
the
shipper
and
then
going
on
from
there
and
assessing
damages.
now,
the
first
order
is
of
public
significance
and
is
reviewable
in
this
action
brought
by
the
carrier
against
the
united
states
and
the
commission
to
set
aside
the
order.
but
the
damages
phase
of
the
proceeding
in
which
there
is
a
much
less
public
interest.
that's
the
subject
of
the
shipper's
enforcement
action.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
as
i
understand
the
practice
of
the
commission.
it
issues
two
separate
orders
and
only
the
reparations
order
is
at
issue
in
the
shipper's
enforcement
act
and
it
is
true
that
the
underlined
violation
of
law
which
is
at
issue
in
the
shipper's
enforcement
action
may
have
continuing
significance
because
it
was
a
subject
of
an
order
prescribed
in
a
new
rate
but
that
order
will
be
reviewable
in
the
ordinary
mode
where
the
commission
and
the
united
states
participate.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no.
the
--
the
question
on
whether
the
carrier
had
violated
the
act
could
also
be
an
issue.
however
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no.
i
think
clearly
not
because
the
question
on
whether
a
carrier
has
violated
the
shipping
act,
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
the
kind
of
question
on
which
this
court
has
said
that
the
basic
determination
is
for
the
expert
tribunal.
it
must
evaluate
and
appraise
the
evidence.
therefore,
it
would
not
be
opened
to
shipper
or
carrier
in
the
enforcement
action
to
introduce
new
evidence
and
ask
the
district
court
to
review
a
de
novo,
the
question
of
a
violation
or
it
can
ask
the
district
court
to
prescribe
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
correct.
i
might
point
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
and
i
might
point
out
that
the
language
of
prima
facie
evidence
in
section
16
(2)
which
was
then
carried
over
to
section
30
goes
back
to
1887
which
precedes
this
court's
primary
jurisdiction
decisions
and
here
as
in
the
case
of
actions
by
shippers
against
carriers
under
sections
8
and
9
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
it's
been
necessary
to
put
this
gloss
on
the
--
on
the
language.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
it's
been
assumed
in
all
the
courts
which
have
passed
on
this
issue
that
the
same
standard
applies
to
judicial
handling
of
the
commission's
finding
of
violation
in
an
enforcement
action
as
in
a
review
action.
if
the
commission's
finding
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
the
court
cannot
upset
it
nor
will
it
receive
evidence
to
impeach
that
finding.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
for
two
reasons.
first,
because
the
commission's
primary
jurisdiction
is
in
any
event
protected;
and
second,
because
insofar
as
a
finding
of
violation
has
continuing
significance,
it's
not
just
a
dead
practice
but
gives
rise
to
a
rate
setting
order
or
other
order
of
prospective
effect.
it
will
be
the
subject
of
review
and
actions
in
which
the
commission
and
the
government
are
a
party
and
can
protect
their
interest.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
our
position
is
that
--
where
the
shipper
sues
upon
a
reparations
order,
the
district
court
in
which
he
sues
and
the
court
of
appeals
reviewing
the
district
court's
decision
has
power
to
review
the
findings,
all
the
findings,
which
underlie
that
order
in
the
same
manner
as
if
the
carrier
were
attacking
it
in
a
conventional
appeal
proceeding.
now,
one
of
the
basic
findings
in
every
reparations
order
would
be
that
the
carrier
had
violated
the
shipping
act
and
this
finding
is
subject
to
judicial
review
of
the
same
scope
and
extent
as
in
any
action.
what
i
suggest
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
because
judicial
review
of
administrative
order
is
limited
to
ascertain
whether
there
is
substantial
evidence
and
a
legal
basis
for
the
commission's
findings.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
can't
think
of
an
example
involving
the
words
prima
facie.
but
i
--
but
it
has
been
a
reoccurring
theme
in
the
review
of
interstate
commerce
commission
orders
that
glosses
must
be
supplied
on
congressional
language
dating
from
the
19th
century,
preceding
the
doctrines
dealing
with
review
of
administrative
orders.
for
example,
in
section
8
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
a
shipper
is
empowered
to
sue
a
carrier
directly
without
going
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
in
the
case
of
a
section
16
(2)
action
to
collect
damages
for
a
violation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
congress
has
held
--
excuse
me,
this
court
has
held
that
a
low
--
the
section
in
terms
purports
to
create
a
damages
remedy
which
is
completely
independent
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
that
action
cannot
be
maintained
without
reference
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
a
decision
on
those
issues
which
are
within
the
commission's
primary
jurisdiction
or
narrow
the
basic
issue
of
violation.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes,
i
think
that's
certainly
true.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that
is
true
and
the
only
--
the
reason
that
that
is
not
a
matter
of
concern
to
the
government
is
simply
that
variant
results
having
to
do
with
the
damages
awarded
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
that's
true
also.
there
can
be
differences
in
the
fine
and
violation.
but
as
i
say,
if
the
--
if
the
violation
complained
of
is
a
matter
of
continuing
importance,
if
the
practice
found
unlawful
is
continuing,
the
commission's
section
22
proceeding
will
give
rise
to
an
order
prescribing
a
new
rate.
now,
this
order
having
general
application
is
reviewable
at
the
suit
of
the
carrier.
if
the
carrier
prevails
in
this
suit
and
the
commission's
rate
order
is
set
aside,
all
danger
of
uniformity
vanishes
and
the
only
element
of
possible
dis-uniformity
would
be
of
variant
damages
of
recovery.
but
so
far
as
the
obligations
of
shippers
and
the
carrier
are
concerned,
there
will
always
be
a
mode
of
dealing
with
the
commission's
finding
and
affirming
it
or
setting
it
aside
across
the
board.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no,
if
a
carrier
challenges
in
order
prescribing
a
rate
as
an
invalid
order.
and
the
reviewing
court
sets
that
order
aside
no
shipper
can
be
required
to
pay
the
rate
prescribed
by
the
commerce
commission.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
true.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
no.
the
enforcement
court
has
no
power
to
set
an
order
aside.
that's
clear
in
the
language
of
section
16
(2)
and
section
(30).
all
the
enforcement
court
can
do
is
decline
to
enter
a
damages
judgment.
it
can
say
that
the
order
is
invalid
as
between
the
parties.
this
has
no
bearing
on
what
the
shipper
is
required
to
pay
the
carrier.
that
depends
on
the
prescriptive
or
injunctive
order
and
that
kind
of
order
is
reviewable
in
proceedings
to
set
the
order
aside.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
in
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
think
there
could
be
a
problem
there.
ordinarily,
what
the
commission
would
be
to
issue
two
orders,
one,
prescribing
rate
and
one
awarding
reparations.
now,
if
the
shipper
goes
into
court
to
enforce
the
reparations
order
and
the
carrier
at
the
same
time
challenges
the
underlying
commission
finding
of
illegality
then
presumably,
the
enforcement
action
would
be
stayed
while
the
basic
validity
of
the
commission's
action
was
determined.
but
in
this
action
by
the
carrier
to
set
aside
the
order,
the
commission
and
the
attorney
general
are
properly
the
parties
respondent
who
are
responsible
for
upholding
the
validity
of
the
order
and
there's
no
problem
of
the
shipper
being
compelled
to
intervene
in
this
distant
form.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
if
the
validity
of
the
commission's
underlying
findings
had
been
determined
in
a
review
proceeding,
the
carrier
would
certainly
be
bound
by
that
determination
and
only
the
issue
of
damages
would
be
left
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
could
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
they
get
a
completely
new
trial
except
insofar
as
damages
questions
themselves
maybe
for
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
posner
well,
i
think
--
mr.
richard
a.
posner
i
think
in
principle,
there
are
damages
questions
which
can
be
re-determined
de
novo
without
invading
that
area
which
is
reserved
to
the
commission
for
the
application
of
its
expert
judgment.
for
example,
if
the
commission
made
a
simple
arithmetical
error
in
computation.
but
if
in
determining
damages,
the
commission
based
judgment
on
the
kind
of
discretionary
factors
which
are
confined
to
agency
judgment
then
i
don't
think
you
could
have
de
novo
re-determination
of
these
commission
findings
but
only
review.
