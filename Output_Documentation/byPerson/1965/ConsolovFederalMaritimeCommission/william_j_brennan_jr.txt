brennan,

but
if
we
--
if
we
were
to
agree
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
have
taken
any
of
these
issues
at
all
and
agree
with
you
that
we
had
to
weigh
16
(2)
procedure
in
the
district
court,
we
would
agree
with
you
about
that.
wouldn't
that
wash
out
everything,
that
the
district
court
--
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
said
on
these
other
issues?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
should
we
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
if
we
were
to
tell
to
the
court
of
appeals,
“you
had
no
jurisdiction
to
do
anything”
and
then
dispose
of
the
case
that
way,
why
do
we
have
to
go
on
and
reach
these
other
issues?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
is
there
a
case
in
controversy
before
us
to
weigh
if
we
take
that
first?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
you
are
saying
that
court
of
appeals
has
no
business
in
this
case
at
all,
is
it
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
mr.
posner,
you
say
fully
reviewable
but
only
on
the
record
before
the
--
before
the
board?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
in
either
instance
--
i
thought
i
understood
mr.
jenning(ph)
to
suggest
that
it
was
not
in
the
area
of
other
case.
that
under
16
(2)
proceeding,
there
might
be
even
additional
evidence
taken
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
supplementing
the
record
before
we

justice
william
j.

amount?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
was
--
that
was
the
grace
line
case.
