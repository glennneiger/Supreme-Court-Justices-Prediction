mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
we
have
here
a
case
which
is,
in
one
way
similar
to
the
atlantic
coastline
case
just
argued
and
in
several
ways
rather
more
far
reaching.
this
case
involves
a
duty
of
a
common
carrier
to
carry
for
all
shippers,
a
duty
which
has
been
recognized
for
centuries.
at
common
law,
when
a
carrier
refused
to
carry,
the
remedy
was
swift
and
it
was
simple.
the
shipper
sued
the
carrier
and
collected
damages.
under
the
shipping
act,
there
is
now
a
statutory
remedy
of
reparation
for
shippers
injured
by
water
carrier's
violation
of
the
act.
the
questions
presented
in
this
consolo
case
involved
a
future
vitality
of
the
reparation
remedy
in
three
very
basic
ways.
first,
there
is
a
question
of
jurisdiction
to
review
a
reparation
order
of
an
agency.
this
question
involves
not
only
the
question
presented
in
the
atlantic
coastline
case
just
argued,
but
also
the
question
whether
the
review
procedure
for
maritime
commission
orders
is
going
to
be
so
violently
complex
as
to
defeat
the
statutory
reparation
remedy.
second,
there
is
presented
a
question
of
the
standards
to
be
followed
by
an
agency
in
awarding
reparation.
is
there,
as
the
statute
says
there
is
reparation,
for
unjust
and
unreasonable
discrimination
or
is
there
hidden
in
the
statute
some
license
to
discriminate
against
shippers
with
impunity
because
of
some
never
before
known
and
unarticulated
doctrine
of
equities
which
defeat
the
remedy
for
flagrant
discrimination?
essentially,
the
question
is
whether
this
maritime
statute
has
in
it
some
vague
equitable
concept
like
the
concept
of
misconduct
in
pennsylvania
discussed
earlier
today.
third,
and
equally
important
for
the
future
of
the
law
of
reparation,
the
consolo
case
presents
an
important
question
of
the
standards
of
review.
if
there
is
a
standard
of
equity
in
awarding
reparation,
who
judges
the
equities,
is
it
to
be
the
agency
passing
on
the
facts
or
reviewing
court
making
fact
findings
for
itself?
the
facts
of
this
case
are
relatively
simple.
philip
r.
consolo
is
an
independent
importer
of
bananas.
as
an
independent
importer,
he
needed
supplies
of
bananas
from
ecuador
which
is
the
country
supplying
bananas
to
the
independents
who
don't
own
the
plantation.
second,
he
required
regular
service
to
carry
bananas
to
the
united
states
by
a
common
carrier
which
had
refrigerated
space
available
in
its
ships.
it
was
carrying
bananas
as
well
as
hundreds
of
other
commodities.
at
relevant
times,
there
were
two
common
carriers
in
the
trade
from
ecuador
to
the
united
states,
the
grace
line
and
flota
mercante
grancolombiana,
which
is
the
respondent
here.
the
common
law
duty
of
an
ocean
carrier
to
carry
for
all
shippers
was
continued
under
the
shipping
act,
and
the
agency
administering
the
shipping
act
had
twice
held,
once
in
1953
again
in
1957,
that
the
grace
line
had
to
carry
for
all
shippers.
in
1955,
flota
had
given
all
its
refrigerated
space
to
a
single
preferred
shipper.
in
1957,
which
is
the
time
it
becomes
relevant
here,
this
carrier
knew
that
this
shipper
wanted
space
but
flota
had
secretly
determined
to
give
all
of
its
refrigerated
space
to
the
preferred
shipper.
consolo,
in
order
to
get
space
on
flota,
in
order
to
attempt
to
receive
the
reparation
provided
by
statute,
had
to
go
through
the
two-step
procedure.
he
first
had
to
go
to
the
agency
and
prove
that
the
carrier
had
unjustly
discriminated
against
him.
that
caused
the
agency
to
make
a
finding
of
unjust,
unfair
discrimination
which
was
effective
for
the
future
and
it
issued
a
cease
and
desist
order
to
this
carrier.
that
cease
and
desist
order
has
been
reviewed
and
upheld,
finding
of
unjust
discrimination
is
unquestioned
here.
next,
consolo
had
to
go
back
to
the
agency
and
begin
the
process
of
proving
his
entitlement
to
reparation.
he
had
to
show
the
damages
for
each
sailing
from
which
he
was
excluded.
the
board's
examiner
decided,
after
reviewing
this
extensive
detailed
evidence
that
consolo
was
entitled
to
reparation
in
the
amount
of
about
$260,000.
at
this
point,
the
carrier
began
to
offer
a
lot
of
excuses
for
its
conduct.
the
maritime
board,
which
reviewed
the
examiner's
decision,
entered
an
award
of
$143,000.
at
this
point,
both
flota
and
consolo
went
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
consolo
claiming
that
the
commission
had
cut
down
the
award
wrongly,
the
carrier
claimed
that
the
award
was
too
large.
consolo
followed
a
decision
in
what
is
in
the
piazza
case
which
is
discussed
at
some
length
in
the
brief.
the
court
of
appeals
held
on
its
first
review
that
it
had
jurisdiction
to
review
the
reparation
award
and
to
consider
the
carrier's
attacks
on
the
award.
however,
while
the
court
had
held
and
affirmed
the
commission
that
there
was
an
unjust
illegal
discrimination
against
consolo,
the
court
also
held,
this
time
without
any
citation
of
authority,
that
the
board
had
made
an
error
because
the
maritime
board
had
defined
not
only
that
the
shutting
out
of
consolo
was
unjust
and
unreasonable,
but
also
that
the
maritime
board
had
to
make
a
specific
finding
that
it
would
be
equitable
to
award
reparation.
i'd
like
just
to
pause
here
and
point
out
that,
in
the
course
of
this
litigation,
consolo
was
still
far
away
from
the
place
where
he
had
to
go
to
collect
any
money
because
he's
--
where
at
this
point,
he's
talking
about
what
is
only
a
piece
of
prima
facie
evidence
in
the
district
court.
the
injured
shipper
has
got
to
get
a
piece
of
evidence
and
get
to
the
district
court
with
it.
and,
all
that's
going
around
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
just
about
something
that
becomes
a
piece
of
prima
facie
evidence.
in
any
event,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
to
review
the
award
at
the
carrier's
instance
and
the
court
of
appeals
sent
the
case
back
to
the
maritime
board
for
a
finding
as
to
whether
it
would
be
equitable
to
pay
the
shipper
for
the
damages
he
suffered.
the
maritime
board
had,
by
that
time,
turned
into
the
maritime
commission
and
the
maritime
commission,
on
remand,
found
that
all
the
equities
were
in
favor
of
the
shipper
but
they
didn't
face
--
they
did
not
fail
to
reduce
the
award
again
by
another
slice
off
the
top
for
the
third
time.
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
it
does
not
have
power
under
the
hobbs
act
to
enforce
the
reparation
order.
we're
litigating
in
a
situation
where,
“heads,
the
shipper
can
lose,
but
tails,
he
can't
win,”
said
the
court
of
appeals.
it
couldn't
enforce
the
order
but
it
held
that
it
did
have
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
shipper's
attack
on
the
order
as
being
too
small,
as
well
as
the
carrier's
attack
that
it
was
too
large.
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
it
took
jurisdiction
on
the
carrier's
--
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
it
did,
under
the
piazza
case
which
--
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
yes,
your
honor.
on
remand--
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
no,
a
second
circuit
case,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
it
held
that
the
hobbs
act
gave
that
jurisdiction
to
the
courts
of
appeals,
although
this
court
had
held
in
united
states
v.
interstate
commerce
commission
that
the
jurisdiction
was
in
a
single-judge
district
court.
now,
it's
our
position
here
that
all
these
reparation
fights
ought
to
take
place
before
a
single
judge
in
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
in
effect,
we
have
--
but
we're
not
trying
to
get
any
advantage
from
it,
when
we
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
i
would
like
that,
but
when
we
field
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
piazza
case
was
on
the
book
and
it
said
that
we
should
go
to
a
court
of
appeals
because
if
we
claimed
that
the
award
was
too
small.
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
i
think
that's
a
very
interesting
question
because
it
depends
on
a
case
not
yet
decided
by
this
court
but
which
someday
must
be,
which
is
whether
the
“negative
order”
doctrine,
it
still
has
any
vitality.
i,
myself,
believe
--
and
this
may
come
up
if
we
get
back
to
district
court
and
sue
on
this
order
--
that
what
the
statute
says
is
that
a
reparation
order
is
a
piece
of
evidence.
we
take
the
piece
of
evidence.
we've
got
to
have
that
much
piece
to
get
to
court.
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
when
we
get
to
district
court,
that's
the
place
for
both
sides
to
adjust
it
up
or
down,
that
the
--
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
in
the
united
states
--
if
we
return
to
united
states
versus
interstate
commerce
commission,
the
doctrine
had
been
rather
clearly
that
if
a
shipper
didn't
succeed
in
getting
a
reparation
order
out
of
the
commission
--
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
no
judicial
--
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
from
the
commission?
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
he
had
no
judicial
review.
u.s.
v.
icc
said
that
was
a
piece
of
the
old
“negative
order”
doctrine,
no
longer
valid.
therefore,
the
shipper,
in
that
case
the
united
states,
may
get
a
review
of
the
denial
of
this
award.
what
i
was
suggesting
was
that
there
is
--
we
have
not
yet
had
the
case
where
the
question
arises,
whether
the
“negative
order”
doctrine
limits
the
shipper
in
the
district
court
reparation
proceedings,
the
enforcement
proceedings
to
exactly
the
--
that's
a
ceiling.
it
has
been
held
by
lower
courts
to
be
a
ceiling,
but
at
the
time
of
“negative
order”
case.
i
return
to
the
progress
of
the
case
we
had
here.
the
maritime
commission
said
the
equities
were
in
favor
of
the
injured
shipper.
and
then,
on
the
second
review
by
the
court
of
appeals,
which
had
asked
the
commission
to
say
whether
or
not
the
equities
were
in
the
shipper's
favor,
the
court
of
appeals
again
decided,
and
again
without
citation
of
any
authority,
that
it
thought
it
would
be
inequitable
to
award
reparation,
and
they
reverse
the
reward,
and
the
shipper,
at
the
moment
it
comes
here
with
absolutely
nothing,
no
piece
of
evidence
to
the
district
court,
where
in
the
district
court,
undoubtedly,
we're
going
to
litigate
some
more.
turning
for
just
one
moment
to
the
jurisdictional
issue,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
make
it
clear
after
the
atlantic
coastline
argument
what
the
general
view
of
all
courts
--
federal
courts
has
been
as
to
the
nature
of
a
reparation
order
and
the
crispest
statement
was
in
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
time
around
on
united
states
versus
icc.
the
court
said
there
in
a
footnote,
it
said
describing
a
reparation
order,
it
says
“by
statute,
such
an
order
is
not
a
binding
administrative
determination
but
is
simply
to
be
considered
prima
facie
evidence
of
the
findings
embodied
in
it
in
an
independent
action
at
law
against
the
carrier”,
citing
section
16
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
“thus,
it
happens
that
no
such
order
has
ever
been
subject
to
direct
judicial
review.”
that
is
the
court
of
appeals
speaking
as
to
what
has
been,
for
50
years,
the
unquestioned
view
of
the
nature
of
a
reparation
order.
it's
a
piece
of
evidence
the
injured
shipper
has
to
take
to
a
district
court.
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
yes,
sir.
but
i'm
not
at
all
taking
the
position
that
the
order
is
not
reviewable
when
it
gets
to
the
district
court,
but
it's
reviewable
in
the
course
of
a
suit
where
the
shipper
sues
and
the
carrier
says,
“no,
i
don't
want
to
pay.”
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
as
far
as
our
appeal
goes?
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
i
say,
sir,
that
we
are
not
trying
to
--
we
brought
the
appeal
and
i
think
we
have
litigated
that
point
with
this
carrier.
we
are
not
entitled
to
go
to
district
court
with
an
order
in
any
larger
amount
than
that
amount
which
--
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
weren't
sustained
against
--
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
that's
right,
and
that
is
because
the
court
of
appeals
has
announced
a
couple
of
brand
new
doctrines
which
really
cut
the
heart
out
of
the
reparation
remedy.
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
sir,
we
brought
the
petitioner
for
certiorari
in
respect
of
the
carrier's
petition
for
review,
which
was
the
first
petition
for
review
ever
entertained
by
a
court
of
appeals,
for
direct
review
for
reparation
order
under
the
shipping
act.
our
petition
for
cert
is
not
directed
to
the
court's
action
below
with
respect
to
our
petition
for
review,
which
was
forced
upon
us
by
this
piazza
case.
we
ask
the
court
here
to
--
and
we
think
it's
more
important
for
the
future
of
the
law
of
reparation
that
this
court
deal
with
each
of
the
three
questions
as
to
which
cert
was
granted,
because
each
is
vitally
important.
it's
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
has
some
newly
discovered
doctrine
after
50
years
that
a
shipper
can
be
discriminated
against,
and
shut
out
absolutely
and
get
no
space
on
a
carrier
but
he
can't
get
reparation
unless
there
is
equity
in
awarding
the
reparation,
whatever
that
mean,
is
very
harmful
to
all
shipper's
right.
and,
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
in
making
its
own
determinations
as
to
what
would
be
equitable
is
destructive
of
the
entire
doctrines
of
judicial
review,
which
apportion
duties
between
agencies
and
courts.
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
i
hope
it
would
washout
--
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
wash
out
what
it
said.
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
to
washout
the
effect
of
it.
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
of
course,
we
do
not
--
sir,
i'm
suggesting
that
there
is
policy
--
an
important
policy
and
not
leaving
on
the
books
a
view
for
these
reparation
cases,
which
imports
a
brand
new
fuzzy
standard
into
the
statutes
and
which
permits
the
reviewing
court,
which
would
in
this
case
properly
be
a
district
judge,
to
follow
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
say,
“i,
the
district
judge,
will
decide
whether
it
was
equitable
to
give
this
shipper
reparation”.
both
of
those
are
pernicious
doctrines
that
should
be,
we
suggest,
expressly
struck
out.
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
if
it's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
n.
kharasch
there's
a
case
in
controversy
presented
this
afternoon
before
you,
which
may
be
decided
on
more
than
one
ground.
we
suggest
three
grounds.
and
we're
suggesting
that
the
court's
opinion
on
each
of
the
three
grounds
is
very
valuable
to
the
future
of
the
law
of
reparation.
if
a
shipper
is
to
make
anything
out
of
that
remedy
which
congress
has
provided,
as
the
case
now
stands,
the
path
to
collect
for
damages
done
by
a
carrier
is
so
long
and
so
torturous,
it's
not
workable.
and
as
the
case
stands,
the
carrier
is
allowed
to
put
in
whatever
it
pleases
and
to
stretch
out
the
administrative
procedure
now
by
indicating
something
is
equitable
or
inequitable.
the
shipper
who's
excluded
cannot
collect
because
of
anything.
and
thirdly,
this
new
equitable
doctrine
appears
as
a
real
threat
to
the
standard
of
judicial
review
in
these
cases.
the
court
of
appeals
here
very
definitely
made
