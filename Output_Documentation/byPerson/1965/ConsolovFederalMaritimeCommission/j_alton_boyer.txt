mr.
j.
alton
boyer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
discuss
a
neglected
area
of
the
case
first,
the
merits
and
then
the
jurisdictional
issue,
if
the
court
will
permit.
i
would
also
like
to
inform
the
court
that
there
were
number
of
other
issues
before
the
court
of
appeals
which
the
court
of
appeals
found
it
unnecessary
to
decide.
these
issues
involved
matters
of
the
propriety
of
the
procedure
followed
by
the
maritime
commission
on
remand
that
involved
illegal
question
as
to
the
proper
measure
of
damages
and
various
questions
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
proper
measure
of
damages
and
the
actual
calculation
of
damages.
we
have
not
attempted
to
brief
these
issues
for
the
court.
we
have,
however,
referred
to
two
of
them
in
our
brief
to
show
that
there
were
issues
of
substance
if
the
court
could
reach
them
which
we
trust
it
will
not
--
we
request
the
court
to
remand
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
consideration
of
all
of
the
issues.
the
respondent
flota
is
a
steamship
company
owned
by
the
governments
of
ecuador
and
columbia.
it
has
a
limited
amount
of
refrigerated
or
rifer
space
on
board
its
vessels
which
should
operate
and
service
between
south
america
and
the
north
atlantic
coast
of
the
united
states.
between
1950
and
1955,
it
had
very
few
--
it
was
able
to
obtain
very
few
shippers
of
bananas
to
utilize
the
space.
never
more
than
one
at
the
time
and
for
a
period
of
about
16
months
prior
to
mid-1955,
it
was
unable
to
obtain
a
single
shipper
to
use
--
the
shipper
of
bananas
to
use
its
refrigerated
space,
the
rifer
space
was
unused.
in
mid-1955,
it
entered
into
a
contract
with
a
new
banana
shipper
who
was
willing
to
risk
its
capital
to
undertake
the
importation
of
bananas
into
the
united
states.
the
contract
was
entered
into
--
only
after
public
advertisements
by
the
carrier
to
which
it
received
no
response.
the
contract
was
for
a
period
of
two
years
and
it
provided
that
the
shipper
might
have
an
option
for
an
additional
three-year
period.
the
shipper
exercised
its
option,
qualified
for
its
option
in
march
1957.
the
contract
was
formally
extended
to
reflect
the
exercise
of
the
option
on
may
22,
1957.
as
of
that
time,
there
had
been
some
additional
--
some
interest
expressed
in
the
use
of
the
space
by
shippers
including
the
petitioner
consolo
and
one
other.
but
each
of
these
shippers
had
bid
for
its
space
only
for
the
exclusive
use
of
the
rifer
space
on
flota's
vessels.
on
august
20,
1957,
the
maritime
board
handed
down
an
order
in
another
case
to
which
flota
was
not
a
party,
directing
that
carrier
respondent
in
that
case
to
cancel
contracts
which
it
had
with
banana
shippers.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
that
was
the
grace
line
case.
the
board's
order
in
the
grace
line
case
--
excuse
me.
the
board's
report
in
the
grace
line
case
was
handed
down
in
late
april
1957.
it
was
subjected
to
petitions
for
reconsideration.
considerable
dispute
between
the
parties
to
that
proceeding
as
to
how
the
report
was
to
be
effectuated,
the
terms
of
the
order
and
these
matters
were
not
resolved
until
august
20,
1957
when
the
board's
order
--
directing
grace
line
to
cancel
its
contracts
was
issued.
consolo,
the
petitioner,
was
one
of
the
shippers
on
the
grace
line
vessels.
on
august
23,
consolo
wrote
a
letter
to
flota
in
which
he
for
the
first
time
requested
that
he'd
be
permitted
to
share
space
on
flota's
vessels
with
other
shippers.
the
letter
was
addressed
to
flota
in
bogota,
colombia.
it
referred
to
the
recent
decision
of
the
maritime
board
in
the
grace
line
case.
i
may
say
that
that
decision
which
clearly
contrary
to
existing
practice
up
to
that
time,
it
was
based
upon
a
novel
and
untested
theory
of
law
which
was
in
fact
later
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
and
the
order
itself
was
clearly
an
experiment
by
the
maritime
board
with
the
regulation
of
the
carriage
of
bananas,
a
specialty
item
in
the
commerce
of
the
united
states.
judge
moore
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
a
still
later
case
in
which
he
dissented
referred
to
the
maritime
board
order
of
may
1957,
the
one
that
had
been
reversed
as
a
guinea
pig
experiment
on
the
shipping
industry
and
an
autocratic
use
of
powers
by
the
board.
the
august
23,
1957
letter
from
consolo
did
not
state
when
he
wanted
to
ship
bananas
he
did
not
state
how
much
space
he
wanted,
he
did
not
offer
to
post
the
guarantees
which
the
board
had
already
said,
a
carrier
was
entitle
to
before
it
was
required
to
give
space
to
a
shipper,
and
it
committed
consolo
to
nothing
whatsoever.
it
cost
him
only
cost
of
paper
and
postage.
he
threatened
to
sue
flota
if
we
did
not
give
him
space.
flota
also
received
similar
demands
from
other
shippers
and
other
shipper's
lawyers,
likewise,
threatening
to
sue.
at
the
same
time,
its
existing
contract
shipper,
panama
ecuador
said
that
if
you
do
give
space
to
anyone
else,
we'll
sue.
flota
was
faced
with
a
lawsuit
whichever
way
it
turned.
however,
it
had
a
clause
in
its
contract
with
panama
ecuador
which
said
that
if
any
portion
of
the
contract
were
declared
invalid
or
unenforceable,
flota
might
terminate
it
on
seven
or
ten
days
notice.
flota's
officials
came
from
new
york,
his
manager
and
director
from
bogota
and
met
with
the
staff
of
the
maritime
board
on
august
--
excuse
me.
on
october
1st,
1957,
presented
the
problem
to
the
staff
and
said
in
effect,
we
will
do
whatever
you
tell
us
but
just
tell
us
what
to
do.
the
board
staff
said
that
it
was
unable
to
advice
flota
as
to
its
proper
course
of
action.
flota
then
filed
a
petition
for
declaratory
order
with
the
maritime
board
itself
on
october
30.
the
board
sat
on
the
order
for
six
months.
it
did
not
assign
a
docket
number
to
the
petition,
excuse
me,
until
may
1,
1958.
when
it
did
decide
to
entertain
the
petition,
it
consolidated
it
with
complaints
or
reparations
and
against
--
complaints
against
flota's
practice
and
for
reparations
filed
by
consolo
and
also
by
another
banana
shipper.
as
a
result
of
the
initial
six
months
delay
and
the
consolidation
with
the
reparations
claim,
the
case
did
not
go
to
hearing
until
november
1958,
more
than
a
year
after
the
petition
for
declaratory
order
had
been
filed
and
no
decision
was
rendered
as
to
whether
or
not
the
contract
was
valid
and
should
be
canceled
until
early
july
1959.
all
of
these
matters
are
fairly
explored
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
board
directed
flota
in
july
1959
to
cancel
its
existing
contract.
as
flota
had
told
the
board,
it
would
do
whatever
it
said.
flota
in
fact
canceled
its
existing
contract
and
it
complied
with
the
board's
order
which
was
served
in
july
2,
1959.
the
board
then
held
supplemental
hearings
on
the
issue
of
reparations
and
in
1961,
directed
flota
to
pay
$143,000
to
mr.
consolo's
reparations.
both
the
shipper
and
the
carrier
then
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
hobbs
act.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
order
directing
flota
to
open
its
space
was
valid.
flota
had
challenged
the
order
only
to
the
extent
that
it
would
serve
as
a
basis
--
might
serve
as
a
basis
for
reparations.
it
remanded
the
case
to
the
maritime
board
having
found
--
the
court
having
found
that
there
was
substantial
evidence
in
support
of
flota's
contention
that
under
all
of
the
circumstances,
it
would
be
inequitable
to
award
reparations
to
consolo.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
mere
fact
that
there
had
been
a
finding
in
july
1959,
directing
flota
to
open
its
space
and
finding
that
its
contract
was
in
violation
of
the
law.
it
did
not
mean
that
the
board
was
not
permitted
to
examine
the
circumstances
of
the
violation
in
the
context
of
flota
--
of
consolo's
reparation
claim
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
would
be
fair
to
assess
reparations.
the
central
finding
of
the
commission
on
remand,
the
commission
having
meanwhile
succeeded
to
the
maritime
board
was
that
flota
was
not
acting
in
good
faith
when
it
undertook
the
contract
with
panama
ecuador
in
may
1957.
the
government's
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals
admitted
that
the
commission's
award
stood
or
fell
on
the
good
faith
finding.
that
finding,
challenging
flota's
good
faith
was
the
first
such
challenge
in
six
years,
six
decisions
and
as
many
years
of
litigation.
there
was
not
a
suggestion
of
bad
faith.
and
any
of
the
trial
examiners,
two
decisions
on
the
subject
and
any
of
the
maritime
board's
two
decisions
on
the
subject
or
for
that
matter
in
any
of
the
briefs
of
the
public
counsel
who
had
participated
in
the
first
phase
of
the
proceeding.
the
procedure
followed
by
the
commission
on
remand
as
we
submit
significant.
it
did
not
refer
the
case
to
its
hearing
examiner
although
the
same
hearing
examiner
was
then
a
member
of
the
commission
staff
and
was
available.
the
commission's
minutes
show
that
five
days
after
argument
to
the
commission
had
called
in
its
general
counsel
and
submitted
the
case
to
him
with
the
direction
to
prepare
a
proposed
report
and
order.
the
minutes
state
that
the
general
counsel
was
given
instructions.
they
do
not
state
what
instructions
were
given.
the
commission's
next
meeting
on
the
subject
was,
11
months
later,
when
the
general
counsel
submitted
a
proposed
report
and
order
and
the
commission
adopted
it.
perhaps,
this
practice
is
ordinarily
unobjectable
--
unobjectionable
for
a
commission
and
agency
requires
resort
to
legal
counsel.
but
here,
the
general
counsel
and
his
deputy
had
participated
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
proceeding
as
advocacy
against
flota
taking
the
position
that
flota
had
violated
the
law
and
should
be
required
to
pay
reparations.
the
same
gentlemen
then
were
given
an
opportunity
to
write
the
commission's
opinion
on
remand.
and
the
commission's
opinion
on
remand
was
in
many
respects
a
restatement
of
arguments
which
the
commission's
advocates
had
unsuccessfully
made
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
time.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
the
participation
of
the
general
counsel
was
made
known
only
after
the
commission's
decision
was
handed
down,
if
i
correctly
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
no,
sir.
no
--
no,
your
honor,
that
was
not
the
case.
the
minutes
show
my
knowledge
of
what
happened
is
dependent
upon
the
commission's
official
minutes
which
are
a
part
of
the
record.
we
were
required
to
obtain
an
order
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
make
them
a
part
of
the
record
but
over
the
agency's
opposition,
the
court
issued
the
order.
the
minutes
show
that
the
commission
requested
the
general
counsel
to
prepare
a
proposed
report
and
order
in
accordance
with
instructions
given
by
the
commission
that's
the
minute
of
september
1962,
i
believe
--
early
october
‘62.
a
minute
--
the
next
minute
on
the
subject
in
september
1963
shows
that
the
general
counsel
submitted
a
proposed
report
and
order
which
had
been
prepared
in
accordance
to
the
instructions
given
by
the
commission
and
the
commission
adopted
the
report.
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
the
general
counsel
didn't
take
11-months
merely
to
mechanically
transcribe
detailed
instructions
which
the
commission
might
have
given
him.
the
commission
admitted
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
general
counsel
had
in
fact
participated
in
the
commission's
decision
making
function.
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
general
counsel
had
formulated
the
commission's
opinion
but
it
found
that
it
was
unnecessary
for
it
to
reach
the
legal
issues
which
this
fact
raises
because
it
said,
the
commission's
findings
were
in
any
event
unsupported
--
were
contrary
to
the
substantial
weight
of
the
evidence
and
that
the
commission
had
abused
its
discretion.
we
contended
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
procedure
followed
violated
constitutional
guarantees
of
fair
hearing,
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
the
commission's
own
rule.
not
only
are
the
provisions
or
the
requirements
of
law
with
respect
to
the
separation
of
functions
involved
but
also
the
requirements
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
with
respect
to
the
formulation
of
the
proposed
report
an
order
by
hearing
examiners
service
to
parties
opportunity
to
make
exceptions
and
so
on.
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
court
below
did
not
hold
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
commission's
decision.
this
is
at
legal
contention
not
dependent
upon
the
particular
facts
of
the
controversy
but
a
contention
that
the
court
below
failed
to
apply
the
substantial
evidence
rule.
the
court's
actual
holding
was
that
the
commission's
determination
and
i
quote
omitting
a
few
words
that
i
don't
think
it's
important,
“ignored
the
substantial
weight
of
the
evidence
before
it”,
and
later
in
the
court's
opinion
that
the
commission
had
abused
its
discretion.
in
amplifying
these
findings,
the
lower
court
stated
that
there
was
strong
evidence
of
flota's
good
faith,
that
flota's
conduct
was
completely
consistent
with
its
assertive
that
they
--
that
the
law
was
unsettled
and
flota's
legal
obligation
was
not
clear
during
the
period
in
question
that
it
was
clear
that
flota
had
acted
on
the
basis
of
reasonable
doubts
with
good
grounds,
with
substantial
justifications
that
flota
had
sought
and
administrative
determination
of
its
duties
as
promptly
as
possible
and
then
noted,
in
addition,
that
consolo
had
suffered
no
out
of
pocket
laws
as
a
result
of
the
exclusion
space
during
--
exclusion
of
him
from
flota's
space
during
a
reparations
period.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
it
aren't
the
--
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
i
--
i
was
quoting
variously
from
690,
691,
692,
693,
and
697
--
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
--
which
is
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
--
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
--
under
review.
it's
clear
in
context
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
fully
aware
of
the
limitations
of
a
reviewing
court,
that
it
was
fully
aware
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
universal
camera
case
which
it
cited
of
the
limitations
of
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
and
in
context,
we
submit
it's
clear
that
it
did
apply
the
substantial
evidence
rule
and
the
government's
brief
in
this
case
admits
that
the
lower
court's
judgment
was
a
decision
that
the
commission's
decision
itself
was
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
so
to
the
extent
that
the
petitioners
here
trying
to
create
a
legal
issue,
what
he
terms
as
a
noble
standard
of
review,
it,
i
submit,
is
to
make
weight
without
merit.
the
government's
contention
on
briefs
is
different.
the
government
says,
not
that
the
court
of
appeals
fail
to
apply
the
substantial
evidence
rule
but
that
it
applied
it,
but
applied
it
wrongly.
this
requires
a
review
of
the
evidence
to
meet.
in
fact,
the
issue
as
to
the
insubstantiality
of
the
evidence
was
not
raised
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
but
we
do
not
believe
this
properly
before
the
court.
consolo's
opening
brief
explicitly
states
that
he
does
not
expect
the
court
to
review
the
evidence.
even
if
the
issue
had
been
raised,
the
court
has
many
times
said
that
where
a
lower
court
has
made
a
decision
on
an
issue
of
insubstantiality,
this
court
will
do
no
more
and
to
decide
whether
there
was
a
fair
assessment
by
the
lower
court.
here,
the
case
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
twice,
before
the
same
panel
of
judges,
each
decision
was
unanimous.
there
was
on
the
same
record,
the
same
issues
were
involved
the
first
time
as
the
second
time
the
case
was
thoroughly
briefed
on
the
merits
some
16
times
by
all
parties,
and
the
court's
decision
in
the
second
proceeding
analyzed
the
problem
and
issues
in
detail
and
as
i
believe,
far
more
better
presentation
of
flota's
case
than
i
can
make
in
the
time
and
context
of
this
proceeding.
we
believe
that
the
court,
if
it
decides
to
review
the
substantiality
of
evidence
will
conclude
--
must
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
make
a
fair
assessment
of
the
record.
if
it
goes
beyond
that,
beyond
the
fair
assessment
test,
then
i
wish
to
point
out
just
a
couple
of
omissions
in
the
commission's
decision,
which
i
think
really,
completely
indicts
the
integrity
of
the
decision.
i
don't
mean
that's
moral
integrity
but
its
integrity
as
a
meaning
decision
on
the
basis
of
the
record
before
it.
the
commission
charged
that
in
may
1957,
flota
deliberately
violated
the
law
in
the
face
of
what
it
regarded
as
two
authoritative
board
announcements,
the
decisions
in
the
grace
line
cases.
first,
the
court
--
the
commission
assumed
that
flota
had
some
obligation
to
consolo
in
may
1957
but
the
hearing
examiner,
the
maritime
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
indeed
the
commission
itself
in
its
brief
the
first
time
before
the
court
of
appeals,
all
found
that
flota
had
no
obligation
or
whatever
to
consolo
at
that
particular
time
and
not
until
august
when
we
receive
this
$100,000
letter.
this
fact,
this
holding
the
commission
in
his
opinion
on
remand
completely
ignored
and
this
holding
is
not
now
an
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
is
no
explicit
finding
that
flota
had
any
obligation
to
any
shipper
prior
to
the
time
that
it
first
received
a
request
from
a
shipper
for
an
allocation
of
the
rifer
space
as
opposed
to
a
request
for
an
exclusive
contract.
and
no
such
request
had
been
received
in
may
1957
and
none
was
received
until
--
there
was
a
request
in
early
august,
the
consolo
request,
the
one
that's
pertinent
here
was
on
august
23.
there
is
some
question
even
as
to
when
flota's
status
as
a
common
carrier
of
bananas,
as
a
common
carrier
of
that
particular
commodity
arose.
the
question
is
not
important
in
the
context
of
this
particular
issue
but
the
record
isn't
precise.
the
examiner
found
that
flota's
status
as
a
common
carrier
of
bananas
did
not
arise
until
august.
the
commission
i
believe
stated
in
a
parenthesis,
tucked
away
in
a
paragraph
that
it
had
arose
when
it
first
started
to
carry
bananas
but,
in
any
event,
no
duty
rested
upon
it
to
a
shipper
until
august.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
do
agree
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction
of
the
shipper's
appeal
and
i
will
--
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
the
question
as
to
review
of
the
amount
of
damages
has
two
aspects,
review
upon
the
instance
of
the
shipper
and
review
upon
the
instance
of
the
carrier.
it
is
our
position
--
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
do
not
worry
about
the
shipper.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
it
is
our
position
that
the
shipper
can
obtain
review
of
the
amount
of
damages
only
in
a
review
proceeding,
not
in
enforcement
proceeding.
and
under
the
shipping
act
and
the
hobbs
act,
that
review
proceeding
must
be
in
the
court
of
appeals.
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
it
is
also
in
a
district
court
but
it
is
a
different
type
of
proceeding.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
that
is
correct
and
in
addition,
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
in
addition,
the
first
time
that
the
shipper,
petitioner
consolo
has
cast
any
doubt
whatever
on
that
proposition
is
before
this
court.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
that
is
our
position
under
the
hobbs
act.
the
carrier
must
file
a
petition
for
review
within
60
days
of
the
commission's
order
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
exclusive
review.
it
was
just
as
certain
as
night
follows
day
that
if
we
had
not
appealed,
not
petitioned
for
review
under
the
hobbs
act
to
the
court
of
appeals
within
that
60-day
period,
we
would
then
have
been
met
by
a
complaint
for
enforcement
in
a
section
30
proceeding
and
the
contention
that
whatever
review
we
might
have
had
in
such
a
proceeding
prior
to
1950
when
the
hobbs
act
was
passed.
now,
failure
to
have
appealed
under
the
hobbs
act
would
have
precluded.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
the
government's
position
here
as
opposed
to
its
position
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
entertain
only
the
carrier's
petition
for
review
of
a
reparations
order.
but
that
once
the
jurisdiction
has
been
vested
by
the
shipper's
petition
then
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
order
in
its
entirety.
now,
this
--
this
position
in
which
we
join
as
an
alternative
ground
for
the
lower
court's
jurisdiction
is
supported
not
only
by
general
principles
of
ancillary
jurisdiction
but
also
by
the
specific
language
of
section
9
(a)
of
the
hobbs
act
which
says
that
once
the
record
has
been
filed
with
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
is
vested
with
jurisdiction,
it
then
has
jurisdiction
to
the
--
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
order.
now,
if
the
validity
of
the
order
is
reviewable
at
the
instance
of
one
party,
it
ought
to
be
reviewable
at
the
instance
of
another
party
and
that's
the
basic
--
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
if
the
proceed
--
if
there
is
a
reparations
order
which
is
sustained
upon
review,
i
think
it's
safe
to
assume
that
that
will
result
in
payment
in
a
substantial
number
of
cases
once
the
carrier
has
received
its
day
in
a
reviewing
court
and
has
raised
such
legal
issues
as
it
might
have
and
loses
then
i
think
that's
the
end
of
the
proceeding
in
many
cases.
if
the
carrier
is
recalcitrant
and
still
does
not
refuse
to
pay
then
the
shipper
must
bring
an
enforcement
action
in
a
district
court.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
the
area
is
not
entirely
clear
but
i
believe
that
the
government
has
--
the
government's
statement
of
its
position
is
fairly
close
to
mine.
to
some
extent,
the
primary
jurisdiction
doctrine
has
imposed
a
gloss,
rightly
or
wrongly,
whether
or
not
it
was
within
the
intention
of
congress.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
if
the
shipper
was
seeking
additional
reparations.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
i
don't
think
i've
made
myself
clear
sir.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
there
are
two
situations.
one
in
which
the
shipper
has
received
from
the
agency,
all
of
the
reparations
which
he
has
asked.
in
that
case,
there
is
no
occasion
for
the
shipper
to
seek
review
of
the
agency
order.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
if
the
carrier
wishes
review,
he
must
under
the
shipping
act
proceed
under
the
hobbs
act.
if
--
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
that
is
correct.
the
answers
of
government
counsel
in
this
case
as
to
the
practice
with
respect
to
reparations
orders
under
the
shipping
act.
i
think
is
not
entirely
correct
so
far
as
the
maritime
commission
is
concerned.
there
have
been
between
1916
and
1961
when
the
account
was
made
by
the
petitioner
here,
only
five
reparation
orders
under
the
shipping
act.
the
question
is
one
of
very
little
significance
in
the
overall
picture.
there
really
is
no
practice
as
to
whether
there
is
one
order
which
will
be
--
one
order
with
respect
to
a
violation
and
a
separate
order
with
respect
to
reparations.
the
matter
is
a
matter
of
discretion
for
the
examiner
as
to
whether
you
will
hear
everything
in
one
bowl
or
separate
the
proceeding.
you
might
just
as
likely
have
a
single
order
with
two
paragraphs,
one
violation,
one
reparation
as
two
orders.
here,
in
fact,
we
have
two
orders.
but
in
fact,
the
issues
before
the
court
of
appeals
even
as
to
violation
were
related
only
to
the
reparations.
we
specifically
advise
the
court
of
appeals
that
we
had
no
interest,
we
did
not
intend
to
oppose
or
challenge
the
commission's
orders
so
far
as
it
had
a
prospective
operation.
we
were
seeking
to
challenge
the
question
of
--
the
finding
of
violation
only
to
the
extent
as
it
was
involved
with
reparations.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
i
think
there's
no
question
about
that
your
honor
that
he
--
that
he
has
a
remedy,
i
think
there's
no
question
under
this
court's
decision
--
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
--
in
united
states
versus
icc.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
and
it
is
our
position
that
his
remedy
is
under
the
hobbs
act
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
j.
alton
boyer
and
i
may
say
that
this
is
the
first
case
in
any
reparations
problem
under
the
hobbs
act
which
there
had
been
since
1950,
perhaps
four
or
five
on
both
sides
denial
and
grant.
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction
has
been
challenged
since
the
piazza
case,
where
the
court
of
appeals
was
held
to
have
jurisdiction
of
a
shipper's
suit
to
reveal
a
denial.
the
government
has
always
been
on
the
hobbs
act
side
of
the
question
until
it
reached
this
court
in
this
particular
case
after
the
court
had
granted
certiorari
in
the
icc
case.
i
will
leave
the
remaining
issues
on
the
merits
to
the
briefs.
i
would
like,
however,
to
answer
mr.
chief
justice
warren's
question
to
mr.
mcdonnell
yesterday
as
to
whether
senator
bacon
was
the
floor
manager
of
the
hepburn
bill.
the
answer
is
that
he
was
not
the
floor
manager.
however,
he
was
a
proponent.
there
were
a
number
of
amendments
under
consideration
at
the
time
the
statement
mr.
mcdonnell
quoted
was
made
and
proponents
and
opponents
and
various
mixtures
in
combinations
involving
several
different
amendments,
all
agreed
with
senator
bacon's
statement
which
he
repeatedly
said.
he
said,
is
there
any
word
or
combination
of
words
in
the
english
language
which
could
possibly
be
broader
than
these,
any
order
or
requirement
and
in
one
instance,
senator
--
on
the
other
side
of
the
question
which
he
was
debating
would
say,
i
understand
or
know
and
agree.
so,
it's
clear
in
the
context
of
that
particular
section
of
the
debates
that
everyone
understood
that
this
was
the
broadest
possible
language.
the
question
was
not,
what
orders
would
be
reviewable
but
what
the
scope
of
review
would
be?
this
was
1906,
the
question
that
was
really
a
primary
jurisdiction
kind
of
debate
in
the
halls
of
the
senate.
i
should
also
like
to
make
the
position
of
parties
before
the
court
of
appeals
clear
to
this
court.
the
--
the
petitioner
here,
first,
raised
the
jurisdictional
question
in
the
first
proceeding
before
the
court
of
appeals
by
a
preliminary
motion.
it
was
an
alternative
motion
in
which
he
said,
either
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
or
require
the
carrier
to
post
a
bond.
the
court
held
the
motion
in
advance
and
decided
that
--
decided
the
issue
at
the
time
it
rendered
this
decision
of
the
merits.
in
his
briefs
on
the
merits
after
he
--
the
motion
had
been
held
in
advance,
consolo
argued
unequivocally
that
because
the
case
was
before
the
court.
the
court
should
take
in
jurisdiction
in
dispose
the
entire
controversy
that
was
the
first
proceeding
before
the
court
of
appeals.
when
the
case
returned
to
the
court
of
appeals
the
second
time
neither
consolo
or
the
government
nor
anybody
else
said
a
word
about
the
jurisdictional
issue.
everybody
assumed
jurisdiction,
exercised
it
and
only
after
consolo
and
the
government
had
lost
on
the
merits
did
they
take
the
position
in
this
case
--
in
this
court
but
the
court
of
appeals
do
not
have
jurisdiction.
and
the
government
says
even
now
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction
on
the
narrow
ancillary
ground.
the
hobbs
act
is
a
subject
which
has
been
referred
to
but
not
really
discussed
here.
the
very
purpose
of
congress
in
passing
the
hobbs
act
in
1950
was
to
solve
the
kind
of
problems
that
we've
all
been
wrestling
here
in
the
context
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
situation.
a
clear
and
overriding
intention
of
the
congress
was
to
provide
what
it
considered
to
be
an
improved
and
uniform
procedure
for
review
of
all
orders
of
the
maritime
commission.
the
bill
as
it
originally
was
introduced
extended
both
to
the
icc
and
also
to
the
maritime
commission
and
it
did
not
extend
to
all
of
the
orders
of
either
of
these
agencies.
the
icc
came
in
and
said,
our
volume
of
litigation
is
just
too
great,
we
fear
that
if
we
are
--
if
jurisdiction
to
review
all
icc
orders
is
placed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
will
bog
down
the
judiciary
system.
so
please
exempt
us
from
the
bill
and
that
the
congress
did.
the
maritime
commission
representatives
its
chairman
and
its
then
solicitor
came
before
the
congressional
committees
and
said,
“we
like
this
bill
except
it
isn't
broad
enough.
please
make
it
sufficiently
broad
to
cover
all
reviewable
orders
of
the
maritime
commission.”
and
the
commission
solicitor
specifically
said,
as
you
have
written
the
bill
now,
it
does
not
include
orders
under
section
22
under
which
we
issue
a
great
volume
of
orders.
section
22
is
the
section
under
which
reparation
orders
are
issued.
and
the
congress
amended
the
bill
in
accordance
with
the
request
of
the
maritime
commission
to
extend
to
all
reviewable
orders
of
the
commission.
now,
no
specific
mention
was
made
of
reparation
orders
except
as
they
fell
within
broad
category
of
orders
under
section
22.
but
there
was
before
the
congress
a
list
of
reviewable
orders
of
the
icc
at
the
time
that
the
icc
was
proposed
to
be
subject
to
the
bill
and
one
of
these
lists
had
been
prepared
by
the
administrative
office
of
the
united
states
courts
and
it's
set
forth
in
the
senate
judiciary
report
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
and
that
list
did
specifically
refer
to
reparation
orders
of
the
icc.
the
congress
was
fully
aware
of
the
identity
or
the
parallel
situation
between
the
shipping
act
and
the
maritime
commission.
in
addition,
this
court
handed
down
its
decision
in
united
states
versus
icc
in
mid-1949.
the
hobbs
act
was
passed
in
december
of
1950.
the
petitioner
here
argues
to
the
court
that
the
congress
intended
to
vest
under
the
hobbs
act
jurisdiction
to
review
only
actions
which
had
formally
been
the
subject
to
three-judge
court
actions
but
that
are
not
the
fact.
the
senate
judiciary
committee
after
united
states
versus
icc
was
handed
down,
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
bill
is
to
provide
a
uniform
procedure
with
respect
to
all
reviewable
orders
and
in
discussing
this,
it
said
in
many
cases,
not
in
all
cases.
in
many
cases,
these
orders
are
three-judge
court
orders.
so
from
the
standpoint
of
the
overall
objective
of
the
hobbs
act,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
language
of
the
hobbs
act,
reparation
orders
should
be
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
language
of
the
act
is
analyzed
thoroughly
in
our
brief.
we
submit
that
even
if
reparation
orders
of
the
icc
are
not
reviewable
at
the
instance
of
the
carrier,
i
believe
they
are.
but
even
if
they
are
not,
they
were
made
reviewable
under
the
hobbs
act
and
that
any
contrary
decision
would
defeat
it
clear,
overriding
purpose
of
congress
in
1950
to
provide
modern
system
of
review
for
reparation
orders.
thank
you.
