justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
of
this
point
and
it
goes
back
to
something
that
you
said
at
the
conclusion
of
the
argument
yesterday
that
interested
me.
as
a
basis
for
making
an
award
of
damages,
are
there
not
usually
questions
involved
that
are
of
more
than
personal
interest
between
the
particular
railroad
or
particular
carrier
and
a
particular
shipper?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes
but
when
you
get
to
a
enforcement
action,
shipper's
enforcement
action
going
back
to
the
interstate
commerce
numbers
which
i
can
remember
easier
and
the
other
section
numbers.
under
16
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
that
basic
order
of
the
commission
that
is
a
general
public
interest
is
drawn
in
question
there
too,
isn't
it
in
the
shippers
action?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
only
issue
on
a
shipper's
action
would
be
the
amount
of
damages
do
you
think?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
what
can
the
commission's
determination
will
be
examined
de
novo
and
that
--
in
the
shipper's
action
on
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
in
that
aspect
of
the
reparations
action
at
least
the
prima
facie
--
only
the
prima
facie
--
the
prima
facie
provisions
of
section
16
give
way
to
a
substantial
evidence
test,
i
suppose,
and
the
commission's
determination
on
that
is
not
reviewable
if
there
is
substantial
evidence
to
support
it,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
to
reach
that
through
a
primary
jurisdiction
doctrine
and
put
that
kind
of
a
gloss
on
the
face
in
section
16.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
been
done
in
the
lower
courts
has
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
see
if
the
--
if
the
government's
point
of
view
is
taken
as
to
--
which
you
summarized
here.
you
don't
see
any
danger
there
being
inconsistent
decisions
on
commission
questions
that
are
of
general
public
interest
when
i
could
be
an
affirmative
by
having
these
multiple
actions
brought
to
different
courts.

courts.
