justice
abe
fortas
mr.
kharasch,
you
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
at
the
instance
of
the
carriers.
i
have
forgotten,
did
the
court
of
appeals
also
take
jurisdiction
of
the
shipper's
action?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
it
did
take
jurisdiction
on
the
carrier's
appeal.
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
--
on
the
shipper's
appeal.
justice
abe
fortas
it
took
jurisdiction
of
both
of
them.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
would
mean
that
this
order
in
your
case
was
not
an
order
from
which
either
the
shipper
or
the
carrier
could
take
an
appeal.
is
that
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
that
position
were
correct
in
the
view
of
this
court.
what
would
that
mean
that
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
was
a
nullity
because
you
wrongly
appealed?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well
now,
at
the
moment
--
justice
abe
fortas
at
the
moment,
you
can't
go
to
a
district
court
for
--
with
an
order
in
that
amount,
can
you?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
would
be
hard
right
there.
now
--
so
what
you're
asking
us
to
do,
if
i'm
correct
in
following
your
part
here,
is
to
rule
that
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
had
no
jurisdiction
over
either
your
appeal
or
the
carrier's
appeal.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
statute
doesn't
say
that,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
this
is
an
inference
on
your
part
and
on
mr.
jennings(ph)
part,
as
i
understand
it,
in
the
prior
case
based
on
what,
on
the
primary
jurisdiction
doctrine?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
question
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
the
first
question
to
decide
is
not
whether
that
icc
has
jurisdiction
and
jurisdiction
to
do
what?
now,
it's
obviously
got
jurisdiction
here,
but
it's
jurisdiction
to
do
what?
to
enter
an
effective
order?
and
if
it's
not
jurisdiction
to
enter
an
effective
order,
an
enforceable
order
or
primary
order,
there's
a
primary
jurisdiction
to
grant
prior
to
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
certainly
mean
to
make
a
pertinent
observation,
but
i'm
terribly
worried
about
this
because
it
seems
that
you
maybe
trying
to
have
it
both
ways,
and
that
it's
an
order
that
can
be
entered
but
it's
not
a
reviewable
order.
justice
abe
fortas
but
isn't
the
manner
of
what
you're
saying
that
there
is
no
form
in
which
the
commission's
findings
and
order
can
be
judicially
reviewed
in
a
reparations
case.
let's
assume
which
i
guess
is
possible
that
you
have
a
case
involving
only
the
issue
of
reparations
and
not
the
question
of
prescription
or
injunctive
relief.
now,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
despite
the
use
of
the
words
prima
facie
in
section
30,
you're
saying
that
the
commission's
findings
have
to
be
accepted
as
inclusive
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying
and
where
do
you
get
an
opportunity
for
a
judicial
review
on
the
basis
of
your
approach
to
this?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
you
would
--
the
math
of
what
you're
saying
then
is
that
the
phrase,
prima
facie
evidence
in
section
30,
i
think
you've
stated
that
very
candidly
that
you
have
to
read
those
words
with
a
very
heavy
gloss.
is
there
any
other
situation
that
you
know
of
or
therefore
calling
in
your
brief
in
which
those
words
have
been
used
by
the
congress
with
the
effect
that
you
now
attribute
to
them?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
boyer,
if
it
won't
interrupt
you.
do
you
agree
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction
of
the
shipper's
appeal?
justice
abe
fortas
that
was
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
review
of
the
known
damages.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
it
your
view
that
the
amount
of
damages
could
also
be
reviewed
and
the
district
court
action
had
the
shipper
chosen
to
proceed
that
way
by
instituting
an
action
in
the
district
court
to
enforce
the
award
or
so-called
award
in
the
commission's
order.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
talking
only
about
the
shipper
at
the
moment.
justice
abe
fortas
i
said,
i'm
talking
only
about
the
shipper
at
the
moment.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
it's
your
view
that
not
only
did
the
shipper's
appeal
like
here
but
that
it
was
the
only
remedy
that
the
shipper
had
with
respect
to
the
quantum
of
damages.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon,
go
ahead.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
with
respect
to
respondent's
standing,
is
it
your
position
that
respondent
had
standing
to
appeal
the
order
to
the
court
of
appeals
even
if
the
shipper
had
not
filed
its
appeal?
justice
abe
fortas
and
in
that
respect,
your
position
does
differ
from
the
government's
position
here,
am
i
correct
in
that
understanding?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
boyer,
may
i
ask
you
just
one
more
question.
suppose
a
shipper
in
your
view,
a
petition's
maritime
commission
for
reparations
and
the
maritime
commission
denies
any
reparations
awards.
in
your
view
does
the
shipper
then
have
a
remedy
by
way
of
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
but
does
he
have
--
does
he
have
--
can
he
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
