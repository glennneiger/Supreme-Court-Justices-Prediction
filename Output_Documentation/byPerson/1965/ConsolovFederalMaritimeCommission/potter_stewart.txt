where
was
the
piazza
case
from,
the
same
court?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
the
one
that
held
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
have
power
to
review
reparations
order
to
be
passed
to
the
shipper
claiming
it
was
too
small,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
you've
changed
your
position.
justice
potter
stewart
usually,
it
works
the
other
way.
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
your
thought,
on
the
basis
of
that
case,
that
the
--
a
single-judge
district
court
would
not
have
power
to
award
anything
more
than
the
reparations
ordered
by
the
commission
--
by
the
board?
justice
potter
stewart
to
go
to
district
court
with?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
with
that
you
mean
--
can
that
--
the
"negative
order"
doctrine,
that's
comparable
to
what
we've
dealt
within
price
case
under
the
counterpart,
maybe
the
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean,
they
didn't
get
a
motion
for
it?
justice
potter
stewart
they
didn't
get
a
money
award
though.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
nature
of
the
obligation
that
the
commission
and
the
board
found
that
flota
had
prior
to
the
letter?
is
this
the
obligation
that
any
common
carrier
has
to
all
shippers
to?
