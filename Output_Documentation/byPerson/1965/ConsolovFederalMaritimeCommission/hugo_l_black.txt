justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
an
order
of
the
commission
has
two
problems
like
this.
the
whole
number
one
if
the
order
is
--
that
the
rate
is
unlawful
and
gives
all
its
reasons
and
it's
decided
on
which
should
do
on
the
primary
jurisdiction
basis.
it
says,
furthermore,
we
find
that
damages
and
award
reparations
from
$100,
that
they'd
both
be
tried
at
the
same
time
in
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
suppose
that
the
shipper
started
to
sue
on
them
before
that,
although,
the
carrier
had
attacked
the
whole
law
then
because
of
the
invalidity
of
its
--
determining
the
rate
was
unlawful.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
a
correct
understanding
of
your
argument
that
to
take
a
case
where
those
two
issues
had
been
in
it
and
it's
been
held
that
the
order
is
lawful
you
were
saying.
then
it
comes
up
and
say,
what
you
mean
by
order
de
novo
--
trial
de
novo
as
to
damages.
is
it
correct
to
say
that
what
you
are
arguing
in
effect
here
is
that
all
they
can
raise
there
is
the
question
of
the
amount
of
damages?
justice
hugo
l.
black
computation
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
how
long
that
thing
had
been
going
on
and
how
many
transactions
were
involved
in
it
and
so
forth,
they
get
a
completely
new
trial
on
that
issue,
computation
and
so
forth,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah,
that
has
either
--
assuming
now
that's
already
been
settled.
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
the
rates,
you
know
what
it
is,
would
be?
how
may
shipments
did
he
make?
where
does
he
go
from?
how
much
did
he
pay?
are
you
saying
that
the
findings
of
the
commission
as
to
the
amount
of
damages
would
or
not
be
--
would
be
or
not
be
final
and
binding
of
the
debt
that
the
factual
questions
involved
under
that
issue
could
be
re-determined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
implication
of
damage.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
page
did
you
read
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
