mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
to
clear
up
one
or
two
matters
that
came
up
in
the
argument
of
solicitor
general.
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
event,
that
the
commission
dismissed
the
proceedings
before
it.
i'd
like
to
call
justice's
attention
to
the
fact,
which
i'm
sure
you're
aware
of,
that
under
the
finality
act
even
if
the
commission
enters
an
order
against
the
respondents,
and
if
the
respondent
doesn't
appeal
there's
no
court
of
appeals
that
obtains
any
jurisdiction.
there's
no
longer
any
enforcement
proceeding
in
court
of
appeals.
violation
of
the
order
by
the
respondent
is
subject
to
prosecution
on
the
part
of
the
department
of
justice
and
the
district
court.
case
only
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals
if
the
respondent
within
60
days
after
the
order
chooses
to
seek
a
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
respect
to
the
questions
asked
by
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
brennan
concerning
page
32
of
our
brief,
(inaudible)
act
--
i
think
it
means
and
it
means
what
the
solicitor
general
said.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
what
it
meant
is
this,
what
actually
happened
mr.
justice
white
in
those
hearings,
the
attorney
general
brown
neil
was
the
witness.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
i
think
what
it
means
is
that
the
federal
trade
commission
asked
that
probably
suggest
that
probably
does
bring
its
own
into
senate
proceeding.
what
happened
was
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
i
don't
know.
i
assume
that
this
is
what
is
happening.
i'm
referring
to
the
attorney
general,
your
predecessor's
testimony
where
he
testified
on
this
very
subject.
he
was
asked
about
this
question,
what
happened
if
the
--
if
he
thought
the
commission
can't
get
temporary
relief.
he
says
that
creates
no
critical
problem.
he
says
we
work
very
closely
with
the
federal
trade
commission
and
yet
there
is
an
occasion,
we're
seeking
this
kind
of
relief,
we
would
file
a
lawsuit.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
we
just
--
attorney
general
brown
neil.
it
does
refer
to
an
argument
in
our
brief.
and
that's
exactly
what
congress
intended
and
that's
the
burden
of
my
argument.
congress
intended
just
that.
as
the
department
of
justice
should
proceed
if
there
was
occasion
to
proceed
in
the
court.
i
think
the
immediate
question
is,
will
the
congress
didn't
consciously
withhold
from
the
federal
trade
commission,
the
authority
to
do
the
very
thing
they're
seeking
to
do
in
these
proceedings.
and
this
is
demonstrated
from
the
very
beginning,
from
the
day
that
first
federal
trade
commission
act
and
the
clayton
act
was
passed,
congress
deliberated
about
this
very
subject.
and
i
hope
to
show
that
quite
initiative
that
what
they
intended
is
what
the
situation
is
as
existed
today
and
as
everybody
understood
to
exist
today
until
we
--
this
proceeding
was
filed.
when
i
finished
with
that
subject
--
hand
to
go
on
to
discuss
this
very
critical
question
of
whether
this
court
should
approve
such
a
radical
departure
with
respect
to
the
proceedings
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that's
the
thrust
upon
the
court
of
appeals,
the
holding
of
the
fairly
difficult
preliminary
injunction
hearings
in
merger
cases.
the
courts
just
aren't
just
set
up.
the
court
of
appeals
just
aren't
setup,
and
those
cases
shouldn't
be
handled
on
affidavits.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
most
district
judges
will
refuse
to
hear
it.
these
cases
on
affidavits
unless
what
we
consent,
consent
of
both
parties,
and
when
i
finish
with
that
subject,
i
hope
to
have
just
a
few
minutes,
make
a
very
urgent
appeal
to
this
court,
to
vacate
to
stay
which
this
court
has
entered
on
the
ground
that
on
the
merits,
the
federal
trade
commission
has
very
little
hope
of
prevailing.
in
view
of
the
uncontroverted
facts
by
no
means,
if
i'm
going
to
ask
the
court
to
evaluate
the
facts
and
balance
closed
questions
of
fact.
i
say
on
the
uncontroverted
fact
as
they
exist
today
beyond
dispute,
it
was
little
like
where
the
appeal
proceed
and
because
this
restraining
order
is
causing
very
grievance,
irreparable
damage
to
dean
foods.
i
hope
the
court
will
vacate
this
day
and
dismiss
the
petition
for
certiorari
to
sustain
the
judgment
below
on
the
ground
that
the
jurisdictional
question
is
really
hypothetical.
well,
anyway
this
court
wouldn't
approve
the
issuance
of
a
temporary
injunction
in
any
event
on
the
uncontroverted
facts
in
this
case.
i
want
to
make
sure
too
that
the
court
understands
that
dean
foods
has
acted
in
the
utmost
of
good
faith
from
the
very
beginning.
we
notify
that
federal
trade
commission
six
weeks
in
advance
for
the
execution
of
agreement
of
what
our
intentions
were
give
them
all
the
evidence
and
asked
them
to
investigate
it.
when
we
signed
the
agreement,
we
told
them
immediately.
we
set
the
closing
date
for
several
weeks
hence
to
afford
then
the
opportunity
to
take
the
matter
up
with
the
department
of
justice
and
to
bring
head
of
the
department
of
justice
bring
the
suit
against
us,
if
they
decide
go
into
court.
we
hope
that
they
wouldn't
proceed
at
all.
we
postpone
the
closing
date.
when
they
decided
they
want
the
suit
to
give
them
(inaudible)
to
the
court
and
what
is
highly
significant
to
your
honors
is
that
we
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
i
thought
it
was,
i
thought
that
was
really
two
years,
the
closing
date
was
really
january
3,
we
postponed
the
closing
date
by
agreement
by
january
10,
and
to
close
the
opportunity
to
file
proceeding
in
the
court
and
give
the
court
the
chance
to
consider.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes
we
did.
in
fact,
we
did.
on
the
whole
history
of
this
thing,
i
had
assumed
honestly,
that
if
they
did
intend
to
sue,
they
turned
the
matter
over
to
the
department
of
justice,
they
do
have
this
close
as
on.
they
worked
very
closely
in
all
of
these
cases
but
this
just
was
--
the
point
i
really
want
to
across
is
that
under
the
agreement,
under
the
agreement,
we
provided
to
protect
dean
food
that
if
there
were
a
proceeding
pending
in
any
court
on
the
closing
date,
we
would
have
the
right
to
withdraw.
we
lost
that
right
to
withdraw
and
we
were
compelled
to
go
through
with
the
closing,
when
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
the
proceeding
and
bowman
did
a
tender
of
performance
and
i
had
to
advice
my
client
that
we'd
be
subjected
to
a
very
serious
damage
suit.
if
we
breached
the
agreement
and
refuse
to
go
to
food
deal
once
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
the
proceeding
but
we
had,
we
thought
--
protect
ourselves
fully
in
agreement
by
anticipating
the
possibility
of
a
lawsuit,
and
giving
ourselves
the
reality
in
the
event
that
the
proceeding
was
still
pending
or
in
the
event
that
a
temporary
injunction
were
granted.
we
lost
our
right
and
we
were
compelled
to
win
to
the
agreement.
the
moment,
the
district
court
for
whatever
reason
dismissed
the
proceeding.
i
pleaded
with
the
district
court
of
appeals
to
hear
us
on
the
merits.
i
wanted
the
hearing
on
the
merits
because
i
was
sure,
we
would
prevail
on
the
merits
and
it
was
this
counsel
for
the
federal
trade
commission,
that
said
to
the
court,
you
can't
hear
the
argument
on
the
merits
unless
you
are
first
to
satisfy
that
you
had
jurisdiction.
i
maintain
that
they
could
dismiss
on
the
merits
without
considering
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
if
they
wouldn't
have
exercised
the
jurisdiction,
so
they
had
it.
coming
out
to
the
immediate
question
of
congressional
intent,
did
congress
consciously
withhold
this
authority?
i
say
that
when
the
clayton
act
and
the
federal
trade
commission
was
first
enacted,
there
was
--
a
big
debate
was
what
authority
should
be
given
to
the
federal
trade
commission.
and
the
decision
was
made
to
put
the
jurisdiction
to
proceed
in
the
courts
in
the
department
of
justice
not
in
the
federal
trade
commission
to
bring
original
actions,
to
bring
contempt
proceedings
in
a
case
--
in
order
of
the
federal
trade
commission
was
violated
with
the
department
of
justice
that
was
to
go
into
the
court.
and
it
was
said
in
the
reports
that
the
federal
trade
commission
had
confined
itself
to
administrative
proceedings
for
time
being
and
then
from
time
to
time
as
experience
indicated,
the
authority
of
the
federal
trade
commission
might
be
expanded.
there
was
not
a
word
anywhere
to
indicate
that
the
federal
trade
commission
would
go
into
course.
but
you
don't
have
to
rely
on
the
ancient
history,
let's
take
the
current
history.
in
the
past
12
years,
no
less
than
37
bills
and
i'm
not
sure
we
found
them
all
but
we
have
found
37
bills
were
filed
in
congress
to
give
the
commission
a
kind
of
jurisdiction
they're
seeking
here.
there
are
all
different
kinds
of
bills
but
in
essence
was
concerned
with
giving
the
federal
trade
commission
the
right
to
get
preliminary
relief.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
none
came
to
vote
in
the
congress
but
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
four,
it
was
only
four
committee
reports
covering
several
of
the
bill.
there
were
five
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes,
there
were.
yes
there
were.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
i
think
it
didn't
come
to
vote
because
the
very
thing
that
were
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no,
no.
no,
i
think
they
just
didn't
come
up
because
there
wasn't
there
much
support
in
congress
to
give
the
commission
the
right
to
proceed
in
the
court
in
view
of
the
fact
to
the
department
of
justice
had
ample
authority
to
see
the
court.
i
think
that
was
--
i
think
that
if
the
department
of
justice
didn't
have
the
right
to
proceed.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
department
of
justice
support
bills
that's
true.
although
that
they
say
--
brown
neil
did
say.
i
think
your
honor
you
yourself
supported
one
of
the
bills,
the
recent,
the
order
of
free
admission.
but
the
change
that
brown
neil
did
say,
there
wasn't
that
a
critical,
there
wasn't
a
critical
on
that
but
there
were
these
five
printed
volumes
of
hearings
on
the
subject.
there
were
four
committee
reports
hearings
to
the
84th
and
85th
and
87th
congress
says
and
here
is
this
most
significant
thing
in
the
--
in
the
hearings
in
1958
before
senator
kefauver.
there
were
whole
group
of
bills,
one
together
for
extent
of
hearings
and
senator
kefauver
in
the
opening
hearing
referred
to
the
range
of
the
bills
before
the
committee
and
their
report,
included
in
the
bills
at
this
time
was
the
finality
bill
which
was
finally
enacted,
which
was
reported
in
clayton
act
which
contains
that
the
act
as
your
honors
know
that
what
the
clayton
act
on
a
parody
was
the
federal
trade
commission
act
and
there,
the
orders
of
the
commission
final
when
issued
without
waiting
for
an
order
of
the
court
of
appeals.
but
in
the
section
11
(c)
of
the
act
is
then
amended,
there
is
the
provision
which
came
out
of
these
hearings
in
1958
which
says
that
the
court
of
appeals
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
grant
preliminary
relief.
when?
only
after
a
petition
for
review
has
been
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
when
the
record
has
been
completed
before
the
federal
trade
commission.
so
we
have
this
interesting
situation
that
the
whole
subject
was
under
discussion
by
the
senate
committee
of
what
kind
of
relief
the
commission
should
be
entitled
to
seek.
there
were
several
bills
and
only
one
bill
was
reported
out
and
eventually
came
law
and
that's
the
bill
which
limited
the
federal
trade
commission
to
proceed
in
the
court
of
appeals
only
after
a
petition
for
review
had
been
filed.
to
my
mind,
that
is
conclusively
terminated
but
with
congressional
intent.
they
refused
to
pass
the
bills
given
the
commission
to
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
i
beg
pardon?
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
it
was
never
voted
down.
there
wasn't
enough
interest
to
apparently
to
bring
it
up
for
a
vote.
and
here's
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
when
you
have
37,
if
you
realize
your
honor,
the
aggressive
program,
the
aggressive
program
of
the
federal
trade
commission
over
these
12
years,
every
single
year
they
were
present
and
they
were
these
hearings.
this
thing
was
fully
considered
by
the
congress
and
congress
refused
to
act
for
whatever
reasons,
they
refused
to
act
and
if
it
is
a
matter
as
we
submit
it
is,
and
this
court
has
held
it
is
a
congressional
intent,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
(inaudible).
let
me
go
step
further
your
honor,
in
the
same
58
hearings,
attention
was
of
chairman
gwen,
the
esteemed
chairman
of
the
federal
trade
commission
who
was
then
testified
was
invited
to
fact
that
two
courts
of
appeals
to
turn
him
down
on
this
very
same
matter
involved
in
these
cases,
the
application
of
the
all
writs
act,
and
he
was
asked
about
that,
weren't
you
turned
down
by
the
court
and
he
said,
“yes,
we
were
turned
down
by
the
second
circuit,
turned
down
by
the
third
circuit.”
for
the
reasons
that
we
argue
that
this
court
should
turn
down
it
again.
and
senator
kefauver
said
to
him,
were
you
consider
petitioning
for
certiorari
in
the
national
paper
case?”
and
judge
gwen
said
very
frankly,
“we
consider,
we
decided
against
it
because
we
agreed
that
the
court
was
right.”
and
senator
kefauver
said,
“i
think
you
were
right
in
that
conclusion.”
so
that
at
that
moment
of
time,
you
had
the
third
circuit
and
second
circuit
saying
that
the
all
writs
act
couldn't
apply
in
the
face
of
the
congressional
intent
to
the
contrary,
you
have
the
federal
trade
commission
agreeing
with
what
the
congress
that
they
didn't
have
the
right
to
proceed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
you
had
everybody
as
your
honor
--
mr.
justice
white
said
a
few
minutes
ago,
everybody
quote
that
there
was
no
authority
proceed
absent
legislature
and
legislation
wasn't
forced
on.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
i
disagree
with
transamerica
case
is
also
--
i
also
think
it's
highly
distinguishable.
for
one
thing,
the
transamerica
case
was
decided
in
1950
before
the
finality
act.
at
that
time,
every
federal
trade
commission
order
had
to
go
to
court
of
appeals
for
enforcing
before
became
an
effective
order.
after
finality
act,
as
i've
said,
you'll
ready
you
don't
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
anymore
unless
the
respondent
chooses
to
go.
and
then
of
course
as
mr.
justice
fortas
points
out,
he
has
his
election
of
the
court.
but
in
transamerica
case,
in
those
hearings
when
they
were
asked
about
the
transamerica
case,
they
said,
“that
case
doesn't
help
us
very
much,
that's
a
very
narrow
decision.”
that
was
a
pure
question
of
jurisdiction,
whereby
race
of
diligence
that
completed
merger
and
ousted
the
federal
trade
commission
and
the
court
of
any
jurisdiction
that's
a
real
judgment.
here,
we
don't
have
any
problem
of
the
court's
jurisdiction
at
all.
the
only
question
here
is
one
of
--
by
the
commission
called
effective
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no,
i
think
the
second
circuit
said
it
was
an
erroneous
decision.
second
circuit
said,
“we
disagree
with
transamerica.”
but
i
say
well,
i
disagree
with
transamerica,
i
think
it's
also
distinguishable
from
the
case
that
we
have
before
us
today.
we
don't
have
a
question
involving
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals
at
all.
no
question
about
the
jurisdiction.
the
only
question
is
one
of
the
status
quo
on
the
facts.
i
want
to
come
to
second
--
and
i
am
going
to
run
whole
this
very
briefly,
the
question
of
the
court
of
appeals
hearing
the
preliminary
injunction
case.
to
my
mind,
this
is
a
matter
of
very
great
significance.
in
this
very
case,
normally
we're
allowed
45
minutes
on
the
side
to
handle
this
whole
case
and
the
court
generously
gave
us
50
minute
during
the
course
of
the
50-minute
session,
during
the
course
of
the
argument
on
affidavit.
now,
i've
been
involved
in
these
hearings
in
the
district
court.
they're
an
entirely
different
type
of
hearing.
when
you're
in
a
district
court,
you
have
pretrial
conference
with
the
judge,
the
issues
are
set
up,
the
decision
is
made
as
to
what
extent,
you
proceed
on
affidavits
and
to
what
extent
you
stipulate,
what
extent
you
proceed
on
testimony.
the
trend,
the
trend
as
reported
by
the
courts,
the
trend
in
preliminary
injunction
hearings
today
is
to
have
virtually
a
trial
on
the
merits
in
the
district
courts
with
hundreds
of
pages,
thousands
of
pages
of
testimony.
the
reason
for
it
is
that
very
frequently
in
these
cases
that
preliminary
injunctive
hearing
is
a
final
hearing
as
it
would
have
been
in
this
very
case,
had
the
court
granted
a
preliminary
injunction
against
this,
that
would
be
in
the
end
of
this
transaction.
the
reason
is
and
important
reason
is
that
you
can't
live
under
a
temporary
injunction
and
maintain
the
status
quo
for
the
period
of
time
that
takes
to
try
one
of
these
cases.
rail
problems,
finance
problems,
customer
problems
and
what
a
normally
if
the
court
stops
the
merger
at
the
beginning
that's
the
end
of
the
transaction.
so
that's
where
the
district
judge
can
fairly
conscience
not
grant
injunction
without
a
full
hearing
or
to
deny
injunction
to
the
department
of
justice
without
a
full
hearing.
and
so
i
say
that
it
would
be
a
very
radical
departure
to
subject
the
court
of
appeals
to
this
kind
of
a
--
to
this
kind
of
a
proceeding.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
that's
right.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
that's
if
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
well,
i
say
that
there's
no
question
here
of
protecting
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
no
problem
of
ouster
of
jurisdiction.
the
problem
here
is
solely
one
of
maintaining
the
status
quo
and
one
of
the
effective
relief
and
on
the
question
to
stand
to
sue
my
position
is
that
congress
consciously
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no,
i
say
this
does
turn
on
whether
congress
consciously
withheld
from
the
commission,
the
right
to
bring
this
very
proceeding.
i
say
congress
withheld
this
--
that
knowing
that
the
commission
recognize
everybody
recognize
they
didn't
have
authority
unless
they
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
i
think
it
does.
i
think
the
statute
(voice
overlap)
as
i
say.
if
you
look
at
the
original
statute,
clayton
act
and
the
federal
trade
commission
act
it's
perfectly
clear
that
there
was
an
allocation
of
functions
between
the
departments
and
the
federal
trade
commission
was
deliberately
confined
to
running
an
administrative
function
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
that's
right.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
oh,
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no
question
about
it.
i
misunderstood
you.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
if
the
district
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
--
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
have
jurisdiction,
no,
that's
right.
that's
right.
no
of
course,
no
question.
that's
what
congress
have
said,
that's
what
congress
has
withheld.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
i
beg
pardon?
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no,
you
don't
mr.
justice
clark
for
the
reason
that
if
you
go
to
either
one
they
merely
contact
the
other
and
they
make
the
decision
between
them
as
to
have
then
proceed.
i
have
gone
to
the
federal
trade
commission
in
the
past
and
ended
up
before
the
department
of
justice.
if
i
find
that
the
department
of
justice
is
the
one
that
is
--
understood.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
we
initially
put
the
closing
the
date
far
enough
ahead
so
the
agencies
of
the
government
would
have
ample
opportunity
to
decide
what
action
they
want
to
take
if
any
and
so
that
if
they
decided
to
proceed
in
the
court
which
would
mean
the
department
of
justice
proceeding
filing
its
own
action
in
the
district
court
and
if
the
case
was
pending
at
the
time
of
the
closing
we
would
have
it
out.
we
would've
withdrawn
from
the
transaction.
they
elected
to
make
a
test
case
out
of
it,
the
reason
why
the
department
of
justice
is
clearly
in
the
record,
they
discussed
with
the
department
and
they
decided
that
instead
of
the
department
suing
this
test
case
would
be
brought
here.
and
as
result
of
that
that
we
got
in
to
the
situation
where
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
jurisdiction
and
we
were
forced
to
go
ahead
and
close
the
transaction
although
we
have
thought
we
had
amply
protected
ourselves
against
every
reasonable
eventuality.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
they
filed
with
the
--
the
issued
a
complaint
first
and
then
they
notified
as
there
were
proceeding
in
court
of
appeals.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no,
no.
they
obviously
went
to
the
department
of
justice
before
they
filed
the
complaint
from
the
very
beginning
according
to
their
own
statements
to
the
court
of
appeals.
they
said,
“we
discussed
this
matter
with
the
department
of
justice
and
it
was
concluded
between
us
that
we
the
federal
trade
commission
should
proceed
and
bring
this
test
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
instead
of
the
department
of
justice
being
in
proceeding.”
i
think
this
is
in
the
record.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes,
it
was.
i'm
sure
it
was.
i
understand
the
whole
statements
to
the
court.
i
must
come
to
this
question
of
state,
in
eliminating
state.
we
are
being
seriously
heard.
you
have
a
situation
where
we
have
only
the
operating
assets
of
bowman,
not
the
liquid
assets,
not
the
financial
assets.
they
were
withheld
by
bowman
company.
the
bowman
company,
there's
a
separate
corporation
that
called
the
(inaudible)
corporation.
they
have
these
operating
assets,
employees
who
want
--
employees
of
either
bowman
or
dean
under
an
ambiguous
status
quo
order
where
we
require
to
supply
the
operating
funds
and
really
don't
control
the
operations,
the
loses
are
enormous,
we
can't
do
anything
about
it,
we
can't
control
the
morale
of
employees.
that's
the
situation
that
we're
in
now
and
here's
the
situation
on
the
merits,
could
the
commission
proceed,
could
the
commission
win
on
the
merits.
i
say,
they
can't
on
the
(inaudible)
effects
for
these
simple
reasons.
they
said
that
the
merger
put
bowman
out
of
business.
the
uncontroverted
facts
are
that
the
major
stockholders
of
bowman
had
decided
before
they
ever
talked
to
dean
to
liquidate
if
dean
or
somebody
didn't
buy
them
and
they
made
several
efforts
itself
and
dean
was
the
only
one
that
showed
any
interest
and
dean
only
paid
them
two-thirds
of
a
book
value
of
their
assets.
they
were
going
to
liquidate
because
they
were
in
a
losing
proposition,
they
were
concentrated
on
retail
goods
in
chicago
and
retail
goods
with
the
horse
and
boogie
stage
of
the
(inaudible)
that
you
just
can't
have.
and
this
court
itself,
mr.
justice
clark
recognized
the
necessity
of
even
the
(inaudible)
of
the
need
of
carrying
on
these
goods.
we're
in
the
process
of
disposing
of
the
goods
which
is
half
of
the
bowman
business
in
the
critical
area
of
chicago.
and
so
take
their
percentage.
they
say
bowman
had
16%
and
dean
had
7%
together
with
23%
and
they
say
this
was
a
big
section
in
american.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
we're
getting
rid
of
half
of
the
bowman
business
and
as
the
court
i
think
understands
dean
is
going
to
lose
its
principal
customer
in
chicago
with
75%
of
all
of
business
they
have
there.
this
is
clear
and
undisputed
no
question
about
that.
only
the
commission
does
to
put
in
the
affidavit
by
the
times
that
it
is
but
we
assure
dean
with
all
their
resource
in
this
will
overcome
that
somehow.
the
fact
of
the
matters
is
dean
is
going
to
lose
75%
of
its
business.
half
the
--
going
business
gone
when
we
get
through
and
this
is
uncontraverted
when
we
get
through
together
will
have
no
more
than
10%
of
the
business
in
chicago
instead
of
the
23%
which
is
the
basis
of
the
commission's
prima
facie
case.
and
the
concentration
in
chicago
on
the
basis
of
its
statistics
of
the
department
of
agriculture
will
be
the
lowest
of
any
metropolitan
area
in
the
entire
united
states.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
the
dean
business
in
chicago,
his
name
is
(inaudible)
but
it
was
build
up
on
(inaudible)
and
they're
going
to
lose
it.
but
that
their
business,
when
they
loses
(inaudible)
the
very
significance
in
chicago
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
(inaudible)
like
all
of
the
others
is
going
into
the
business
themselves.
(inaudible)
customer
of
bowman
which
is
one
of
the
customer
we're
taking
over.
they're
going
into
the
business
in
cincinnati
themselves,
they're
going
into
detroit
in
just
a
matter
of
time
when
they
are
going
in
to
the
business.
so
what
dean
is
going
to
get,
dean
is
just
trying
to
rescue
something,
to
salvage
which
they
can
from
bowman
and
dean
and
maintain
a
viable
business
here.
and
the
end
result
is
going
to
be
that
the
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
confidentially,
and
its
confidence
letter
is
filed
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
there
are
problems
and
so
fort
sir.
and
i
don't
want
to
prejudice
(inaudible)
anyway.
they
have
their
own
problems
working
out
on
their
own
solution,
they've
been
very
(inaudible)
in
giving
the
commission
the
true
statement
of
what
they're
intentions
were
and
that
letter
was
filed
with
the
court
of
appeals.
but
what
i
say
is,
so
bowman
was
going
to
go
out
of
business
anyway.
the
situation
that
is
so
much
better
from
the
stand
point
of
concentration
and
ever
was
before
with
these
two
companies
having
together
only
10%
of
the
business
and
the
independents
having
over
70%
of
the
business
in
chicago
compared
to
60%
a
short
time
ago.
i
say
there
is
no
chance
of
their
winning
this
case
in
the
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
not
in
those
terms.
what
actually
happened
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
what
actually
happened
was
this
your
honor,
when
they
notified
us,
that
they
objected
to
the
proceeding,
we
made
several
suggestion
that
we
come
down
and
see
if
we
can
work
something
all
with.
we
didn't
want
a
litigation
and
we
wanted
to
sit
down
with
them
and
see
if
we
could
make
some
accommodation,
agree
not
to
dispose
to
this
or
dispose
of
that,
solved
our
problem
but
helped
them
too.
they
expressed
no
interest
in
that,
they
wanted
to
file
this
test,
this
test
case.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
yes.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no,
they
wouldn't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
mr.
justice
fortas.
one
thing
they
absolutely
insisted
on
was
the
thing
this
court
granted,
the
thing
they
absolutely
insisted
on
is
that
we
should
not
dispose
of
these
retail
goods
in
chicago.
that
was
a
sign
of
(inaudible).
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
and
we
couldn't
do
that
because
that
was
breaking
the
back
of
bowman
and
would've
broken
our
back
and
mr.
justice
clark
recognized
that
promptly
and
we
got
the
relief
on
that
from
this
court
not
from
the
federal
trade
commission.
so,
and
the
reason
they
were
--
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
no,
i
think
not,
not
--
no,
it
did
not.
no,
it
did
not.
but
i
want
to
make
sure
that
you
understand
the
significance
of
it,
they
made
it
clear
to
us
that
there
no
circumstances
whether
they
let
us
get
rid
of
those
retail
goods
and
the
only
reason
why
is
that
affected
of
their
jurisdiction,
their
statistics,
if
we
gave
up
their
goods
instead
of
60%
bowman
would
have
a,
instead
of
23%
you
only
have
whatever
was
60
and
so
they
needed
us,
require
us
to
hang
on,
on
those
goods
just
so
they
would
have
a
case
on
earth.
mr.
hammond
e.
chaffetz
we
didn't
propose,
let
me
make
that
clear
your
honor.
i
would
have
gone
to
them
if
i
thought
there
was
a
reason
for
chance
to
work,
and
now
we
did.
we
called
them
several
times
to
see
if
we
could
work
out
something
but
when
they
needed
--
absolutely
clear
to
us
that
the
retail
goods
had
it
be
maintained
under
any
circumstances,
there
was
no
point
of
our
going
to
them
and
suggest
some
kind
of
solution
because
we
just
couldn't
do
that.
we
had
to
get
relief
both
those
goods
lost
the
bowman
company
alone
a
million
and
a
half
dollars
in
1964
and
a
losses
i
could
assure
your
honor,
are
great
even
now
even
though
we've
gotten
there
most
of
--
because
once
you
get
rid
of
the
routes
you
still
have
a
plan,
and
we
had
a
great
big
hulk
of
a
plant
there,
without
the
utilization
that
passed
under
the
status
quo,
we
have
to
keep
this
great
big
whole
hulking
plant
going
there
until
someday
the
commission
to
decide
this
case.
so
for
those
reasons,
i
urgently
ask
your
honors
to
look
the
latter
section
of
our
brief
where
we
set
these
facts
in
more
detail,
consider
of
a
status
quo
order
should
be
vacated
and
that
the
petition
for
certiorari
should
be
dismissed
because
it
was
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
thank
you
very
much.
