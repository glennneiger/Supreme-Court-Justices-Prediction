mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
i
would
like
to
first
reverse
and
give
the
question
and
then
get
to
the
facts
because
the
two
are
so
combined
together,
there’s
only
a
single
question
before
the
court,
it’s
whether
or
not
a
federal
court
of
appeals
having
ultimate
review
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
trade
commission
merger
proceeding
may
under
the
all
writs
statute
issue
an
injunction
to
maintain
the
status
quo
pending
the
outcome
of
the
administrative
proceedings
where
the
validity
of
a
merger
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
is
pointed
issue.
we
emphasize
that
only
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
involved
in
this
case
because
that
was
the
ruling
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
we
do
not
argue
that
in
the
circumstance
of
this
case
adaptable
principles
required
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
for
the
court
below
did
not
reach
the
merits
of
the
question.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
dismissed
the
petition
of
the
commission
on
the
grounds
that
was
simply
without
power
to
entertain
it.
and
so
the
facts
be
very
briefly
stated,
around
december
13
of
last
year,
dean
foods
company
and
bowman
dairy
company
agreed
that
dean
would
acquire
all
of
bowman’s
operating
assets
as
of
january
3
of
this
year.
the
month
prior
granting
to
this
agreement,
dean
had
asked
the
merger
division
of
the
federal
trade
commission
for
its
informal
advice
as
to
the
legality
of
this
proposed
acquisition.
and
after
an
immediate
investigation,
the
merger
division
of
ftc
advised
dean
that
it
would
recommend
that
a
complaint
be
issued
against
this
acquisition.
dean
and
bowman
were
substantial
competitors
in
the
sale
of
package
milk
in
chicago
area.
bowman
was
the
first
or
second
largest
seller
of
packaged
milk
while
dean
was
the
third
or
fourth
largest
seller
in
that
area.
all
together,
the
four
largest
dairy
companies
had
a
combined
market
in
the
area.
the
share
exceeded
40%
of
that
market.
since
the
agreement
between
dean
and
bowman
would
eliminate
bowman
as
a
competitor,
there
was
we
submit
sufficient
reason
to
believe
that
it
would
violate
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
in
view
of
the
high
concentration
in
the
chicago
milk
market.
dean,
however,
notified
the
commission's
staff
on
december
14th,
that
the
purchase
agreement
between
bowman
had
been
consummated
and
executed
the
day
before
which
was
december
13.
and
on
december
22,
the
commission
--
the
federal
trade
commission
issued
a
complaint
charging
that
dean's
acquisition
of
bowman
would
substantially
lessen
competition
in
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
now,
dean
had
told
the
commission
staff
that
shortly
after
a
consummation
agreement,
it
intended
to
dispose
off
bowman's
retail
delivery
milk
routes,
closed
barriers
of
its
plants
and
consolidate
operations
of
the
two
companies
and
so
the
commission
on
december
30
filed
a
petition
in
the
seventh
circuit
which
is
the
normal
within
dispute
as
the
court
of
appeals
which
would
have
the
ultimate
jurisdiction
to
review
any
action
by
the
federal
trade
commission.
and
in
these
pleadings,
was
sought
an
order
under
the
all
writs
statute
enjoining
dean
and
bowman
from
taking
any
steps
to
carry
out
the
purchase
agreement
pending
completion
of
the
commission's
adjudication
of
its
complaint.
and
in
that,
they
alleged
--
the
commission
alleged
that
if
dean
carried
out
its
plans
for
the
disposition
of
bowman's
assets,
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
to
restore
bowman
as
a
viable
independent
company,
should
the
acquisition
finally
be
adjudged
and
lawful.
the
commission
wished
to
preserve
the
possibility
of
an
effective
remedy
against
this
merger.
on
january
4th,
the
court
of
appeals
entered
the
temporary
restraining
order
and
agreement
was
held
up
on
january
of
19th,
the
seventh
circuit
dismissed
the
commission
petition
for
one
of
jurisdiction
and
at
the
same
time
it
dissolve
the
temporary
restraining
order.
and
three
hours
later,
the
purchase
agreement
was
carried
out
and
dean
begun
effectuating
the
merger.
and
on
january
24th,
mr.
justice
clark
entered
the
order
stating
most
of
the
changes
in
the
business
in
operation
of
bowman
pending
the
disposition
of
this
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
the
commission's
lawyers.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
no
sir.
the
--
mrs.
turner
was
here
was
the
one
who
represented
them
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
very
beginning,
of
course
it
should
be
pointed
out
it
was
on
affidavits
and
both
sides,
lawyers
appeared
and
the
commission's
lawyers
argued
under
the
all
writs
statute
and
the
three
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
especially
residing
judge
kept
insisting
that
the
commission
had
no
right
to
file
the
suit
and
had
no
standing.
the
lawyer
representing
dean
insisted
that
he
would
go
into
the
merits
and
constantly
told
the
court
that
if
the
court
granted
the
restraint
--
granted
the
injunction,
the
only
recourse
would
be
to
drop
the
agreement
and
everything
would
fall
through.
and
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
appears
here
on
page
154,
set
forth
clearly
that
the
whole
theory
was
that
the
commission
had
no
right
to
file
the
action.
and
indeed
in
this
court,
dean
has
insisted
that
the
point
is
whether
or
not
the
federal
trade
commission
has
standing
to
sue
rather
than
to
whether
or
not
the
all
writs
statute
means
what
it
says.
of
course,
we
recognize
that
the
department
of
justice
acting
through
the
anti-trust
division
could
have
gone
into
the
district
court
but
there
are
two
points
that
we
have
met
at
the
beginning
of
this.
and
i
don't
think
there's
legal
relevance
to
it
except
for
the
in
terrorem
effect
but
dean
went
to
the
federal
trade
commission
to
report
this
merger,
they
didn't
go
to
the
anti-trust
division.
and
its
understanding
that
i
have
is
that
either
the
anti-trust
or
federal
trade
could
have
looked
at
this
merger
but
that
because
of
the
large
number
of
milk
merger
cases
that
have
been
considered
by
the
federal
trade
commission,
it's
generally
understood
that
the
federal
trade
commission
is
better
equipped
to
examine
into
the
merger
of
milk
mergers,
milk
companies,
then
would
be
the
anti-trust
division
to
the
same
--
i
understand
there
are
others
like
automobiles
etcetera,
that
anti-trust
itself
is
better
equipped
to
handle.
the
two
agencies
have
coextensive
authority
in
this
field
but
the
argument
is
very
interesting
on
behalf
of
dean
and
bowman.
i'm
sure
that
had
the
anti-trust
division
moved
in
the
district
court,
the
argument
would
be
made
that
the
federal
trade
commission
should
have
moved
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
don't
know
just
how
it
would
work
out.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
it
would
be
moving
under
its
authority
as
the
department
of
justice
under
statutory
authority
but,
if
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
it
would
have
been
its
own
complaint
but
i
do
not
--
it's
my
understanding
that
the
anti-trust
division
in
the
federal
trade
commission
keep
each
other
advised
of
what
the
other
one
is
doing
but
if
it
is
an
anti-trust
matter
then
the
anti-trust
division
of
the
department
of
justice
handles
it
in
the
us
attorney
or
member
of
the
anti-trust
division
is
the
man
who
proceeds
and
not
the
commission.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
--
and
if
so,
they
would
only
have
had
to
show
that
they
had
a
good
reasonable
possibility
of
winning,
that's
all
they
would
have
to
show.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
right.
well,
not
an
aid
to
the
federal
trade
commission
would
be
on
their
own
action.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
and
we
think
that
congress
in
setting
up
the
two
fields
had
in
mind
that
there
were
some
types
of
actions
that
a
commission
independently
could
handle
better
than
an
arm
of
the
department
of
justice
where
the
ultimate
decision
in
the
department
of
justice
anti-trust
case
is
made
by
the
district
judge.
the
decision
if
made
by
the
commission
is
made
by
the
federal
trade
commission
and
the
court
of
appeals
comes
in
only
after
the
trade
commission
makes
its
ruling
so
that
the
expertise
is
really
the
commission.
now,
if
the
federal
trade
commission
is
unable
to
hold
things
in
the
status
quo
under
certain
circumstances,
then
once
they
decide
the
case
and
that
there
should
divestiture,
it's
possible
that
you
can't
divest
what
you
don't
have
and
that
is
why
we
sought
there
was
no
question
but
that
the
court
of
appeals
having
the
ultimate
order
to
sign
in
this
particular
case
or
any
other
case,
most
certainly
had
the
right
to
protect
its
jurisdiction
not
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
trade
commission
or
counsel,
but
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals
itself.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
yes.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
it's
either
the
--
i
understand,
it's
either
the
--
where
they
do
business
or
where
they
reside.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
not
in
this
case.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
yes
they
would.
they
would've
had
a
choice,
yes
sir.
they
would've
had
a
choice.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
no
sir,
but
it
is
a
foregone
conclusion
that
the
seventh
circuit
was
a
court
of
appeals
which
would
have
had
jurisdiction.
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
real
nub
of
it
as
i
understand
from
the
pleading,
from
the
affidavits,
the
real
challenge
to
the
merger
is
in
the
chicago
area
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
no
sir.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
i
have
to
agree
i
think
on
that
but
the
whole
point
is
that,
it
wouldn't
make
too
much
difference
as
this
--
the
posture
of
this
case
brings
us
to
it.
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
decided
that
the
federal
trade
commission
lost
out
on
the
two
points
or
either
one
of
them,
namely
that
they
would
more
than
likely
prevail
eventually
and
two,
the
irreparable
harm
wasn't
shown,
then
the
trade
commission
would
be
pretty
hard
pushed
in
this
case
but
in
this
case
the
court
said
we
just
don't
have
jurisdiction
and
i
think
that's
the
point
that
the
trade
commission
and
indeed
the
united
states
government
is
interested
in
clearing
up.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
it
would
be
which
i
think
was
saying
in
any
court
of
appeals.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well,
i
think
the
--
as
i
read
it,
was
a
little
confused
and
i
think
it
goes
on
standing
to
sue.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
mr.
justice
fortas,
normally,
i
would
say
yes,
but
i
have
a
little
different
feeling
about
the
whole
writ
statute.
the
all
writ
statute,
as
i
understand
it,
is
not
for
the
benefit
of
any
litigant.
it's
solely
for
the
benefit
of
the
court's
jurisdiction
and
i
think
that
standing
to
sue
isn't
in
the
same
category
as
to
standing
the
sue
for
damages
or
standing
to
ask
for
an
injunction.
i
believe
that
the
all
writ
statute
is
the
court
should
be
able
to
do
it
without
parties
if
necessary
because
i
can't
find
a
single
case
etcetera.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
no
sir,
you
have
to
have
a
controversy
obviously
in
order
for
the
court
to
have
jurisdiction
and
can't
have
a
controversy
without
parties.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
that's
where
i
get
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
--
controversies
and
lots
of
controversies
that
are
can't
controversies
in
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
yes,
but
i
mean
that's
why
the
court
is
correct
that
you
do
have
to
have
standing
to
sue
because
the
standing
to
sue
is
back
with
the
commission
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
has
the
ultimate
jurisdiction
over
the
merger
proceeding
in
the
federal
trade
commission
then
i
don't
see,
how
could
say
that
the
federal
trade
commission
doesn't
have
the
standing
to
ask
the
court
of
appeals
to
protect
what
ultimately
will
have
to
come
to
the
court
of
appeals.
and
along
that
same
line
it
seems
to
me
that
i
should
mention
the
other
point
of
dean's
argument
which
is
that
this
will
be
very
harmful
to
the
courts
of
appeals
because
they
aren't
setup
to
hear
cases
where
there's
an
evidentiary
problem
involved.
well,
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
they
are
running
about
and
i
thought
some
unknown
reason,
i'm
familiar
with
the
fact
that
the
courts
of
appeals
are
little
loaded
with,
they
don't
want
extra
work.
but
there
are
only
about
six
of
these
merger
cases
that
arrive
each
year
and
if
you
divide
six
among
11
circuits,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
too
tough.
secondly,
that
many
of
these
has
not
most
of
them
when
the
application
is
made
for
the
temporary
injunction,
there
will
be
affidavits
and
counter
affidavits,
expert
affidavits
and
factual
affidavits,
and
there
would
not
normally
be
the
necessity
for
live
testimony
with
the
caveat
that
there
had
been
district
court
cases
that
have
been
reasonably
protracted,
similar
cases
and
they're
correct
that
some
of
them
around
five
days
or
six
days.
but
i
don't
believe
that
that
in
and
of
itself
is
enough
deny
the
right
of
the
federal
trade
commission
to
use
or
to
ask
for
or
to
request
the
court
of
appeals
to
use
its
all
writs
statute.
the
other
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
i
should
say
that
if
i
protect
myself
to
this,
once
the
trade
commission
agrees
that
they're
going
to
take
the
matter
as
contrasted
to
the
department.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
then
they
cannot
go
in
the
district
court
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
that's
exactly
my
understanding.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
my
understanding
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
as
i
understand
it,
we
deal
with
it
on
page
32
of
our
brief
but
in
specific
answer
to
your
question,
the
trade
commission
could
ask
the
attorney
general
to
act,
that's
as
far
as
that
goes.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
no
sir,
i
think
it
would
have
to
seek
it
on
its
own
behalf
that's
in
the
district
court.
i
don't
see
how
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
for
the
federal
trade
commission.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
absent
the
suit
by
the
department
of
justice
pursuant
to
its
section
of
the
court.
there
are
two
different
section
involved
and
i
would
say
that
if
the
--
when
this
first
started,
it
is
my
understanding
that
despite
the
fact
that
dean
went
to
trade
that
the
federal
trade
commission
could
very
well
have
said,
“look
we're
not
involved
in
dairy
cases.
we'll
refer
this
over
to
the
department
of
justice.”
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
we'd
have
to
--
i
guess
the
archive
built
in
there
would
be
no
man's
land
between
the
trade
commission
and
the
department
of
justice
but
everybody
was
really
be
dug
in.
i
think
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
no
sir.
we
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
no
sir,
the
reason
we
didn't
was
the
research
that
didn't
have
to
be
original
research,
it
was
there.
this
was
when
the
federal
trade
commission
was
trying
to
get
its
own
authority
to
issue
injunctions
in
every
thing
and
it's
all
tied
up
together
that's
why
we
don't
object
to
talk
to
any
of
these
quotes.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
in
the
district
court
but
that
wouldn't
be
the
trade
commission
and
the
two
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well,
the
allegations
that
are
made
are
that
dean
intends
to
close
out
factories,
to
close
out
business
--
i
don't
mean
--
i
mean
claims
because
i
think
those
allegations
are
made
and
at
this
stage,
i
don't
know
what
the
proof
would
be
but
i
assume
the
federal
trade
commission
would
not
make
those
allegations
unless
it
was
correct.
and
they
threatened
it
all
along,
dean
has
been
threatening
it
as
long
it
would
go.
weapon
on
the
go.
now,
if
they
can
show
at
the
hearing
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
you're
not
going
to
get
rid
of
plants
and
not
going
to
get
rid
of
machinery,
you
are
not
going
to
get
rid
of
that
then
that
all
that
goes
to
whether
or
not
an
injunction
was
necessary.
but
the
fact
that
they
don't
want
to
hold
things
in
statute
quo
would
seem
to
me
at
least
to
be
that
they
were
in
a
hurry
and
my
only
point
is
that
i'm
not
saying
that
the
federal
trade
commission
is
entitled
to
this
injunction.
i'm
saying
then
entitled
to
have
a
full
hearing
and
that
on
the
basis
of
this
record
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
issued
the
injunction.
that's
our
only
position.
now,
what
ultimately
will
come
out
of
it
and
incidentally
the
trade
commission
is
proceeding
as
fast
as
they
can
with
their
hearing.
the
trade
commission
has
been
trying
to
get
more
than
this
mr.
justice
harlan.
they've
been
trying
to
get
their
right
to
issue
their
own
order
without
even
coming
into
the
court.
and
they
have
been
doing
--
yes
sir,
they've
been
trying
to
get
this
particular
right
but
that
isn't
of
any
value
at
all
in
this
particular
case
because
there'd
been
other
cases
in
which
there's
been
a
showing
that
the
du
pont
case
for
example,
where
they
constantly
try
to
get
the
horizontal
and
the
vertical
straightened
out.
and
eventually
congress
did
do
it
but
this
court
didn't
either
on
dupont
case.
i
think
the
fact
that
they've
been
trying
to
get
it
does
not
--
my
position
is
that
in
this
case,
as
in
similar
cases,
unless
congress
says
that
in
ftc
cases,
the
all
writ
statute
shall
not
apply,
the
all
writ
statute
applies.
it's
not
that
you
have
to
show
affirmative
authority
to
use
it
but
we
have
a
right
to
use
it
unless
there's
affirmative
authority
not
to
use
it.
that's
our
position.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
i
understand
that
there
have
been
several
efforts
before
but
they
have
been
settled
different
ways,
some
have
been
voluntary
and
there
have
been
others.
but
that
the
anti-trust
bar
knew
that
it
was
coming.
now,
that's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
this
type
of
proceedings,
not
this
case,
this
type
of
--
that
the
federal
trade
commission
was
going
to
try
to
do
it.
i
mean
it
was
an
article
by
commissioner
ellman
and
others
that
sort
of
said
that
they
were
trying.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
i
think,
we
would
agree
on
that.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
it's
my
position
that
they
assumed
that
this
power
was
there,
the
all
writ
statute.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
sir?
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well,
committee
reports
are
of
value,
if
you
are
construing
a
particular
statute
but
i
don't
think
a
committee
report
on
a
federal
trade
commission
request
is
binding
on
interpretation
of
the
all
writ
statute
which
has
been
there
for
quite
a
while.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
i
think
this
court
--
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
i
think,
that
i
would
be
in
complete
agreement
with
that.
the
committee
was
interested
in
not
moving
too
fast
and
not
getting
to
federal
trade
commission
to
watch
power.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
well,
i
also
think
that
the
federal
trade
commission
would
push
a
little
hard
too.
i
think
they
were
both
there
but
the
--
i
would
beg
that
we
get
to
the
point
of,
congress
has
clearly
said
that
something
must
be
done
to
examine
and
look
into
these
mergers.
they
are
given
the
authority
both
to
anti-trust
and
to
the
federal
trade
commission
and
i
believe
that
congress
intended
that
neither
group,
neither
department
of
justice
or
federal
trade
be
taken
away
anything
necessary
tools
that
they
need
if
they
do
not
into
federal
trade
commission
does
need
this
then
certainly
they
shouldn't
have
but
this
i
think
on
the
record
in
this
case
where
dean
is
going
to
make
it
impossible
to
reset
up
bowman.
i
think
that
this
is
the
type
of
one
when
dean
is
not
or
but
it
maintain
the
status
quo
that
in
this
case
the
federal
trade
commission
should
be
given
an
authority
and
that
would
automatically
be
limited
to
a
showing
that
there
is
convincing
evidence
that
if
this
is
allowed
to
remain
divestiture
will
not
work
not
entirely
but
it
will
be
difficult.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
i
don't
know
sir,
“never”.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
it
says,
(inaudible)
institute
and
there
was
a
little
“a
little
difference”
between
the
two.
mr.
solicitor
general
marshall
therefore,
if
it
please
the
court
it's
the
government's
position
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
seventh
circuit
should
be
reversed
and
remanded
to
them
for
the
purpose
of
issuing
the
injunction
and
that
the
restraining
order
issued
by
mr.
justice
clark
be
continued
in
the
meantime.
