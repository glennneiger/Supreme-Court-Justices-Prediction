justice

r.
white
who
represented
the
commission
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
part
--
the
justice
had
no
connection
to
that
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
department
had
moved
in
the
district
court,
would've
been
moving
under
perhaps
the
federal
trade
commission
or
to
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
would
have
been
in
connection
with
the
complaint
of
its
own,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
could
i
ask
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
that
you
feel
that
this
is
the
only
avenue
that
the
federal
trade
commission
could
follow.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
get
to
the
kind
of
relief
that
it
wants,
this
protection
pending
a
hearing.
this
is
the
only
rule
that
may
go.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
the
only
other
to
way
to
get
relief
with
department
of
justice
file
sue
itself
and
then
the
whole
case
maybe
at
the
department
of
justice
or
the
federal
trade
commission.
justice
byron
r.
white
dean's
brief
on
page
33
says
this,
with
regard
to
the
seeking
a
temporary
restraining
order
that
doesn't
observed
however
that
the
commission
does
have
the
right
to
request
the
attorney
general
to
seek
such
action
on
its
behalf
including
a
senate
report
in
1957.
i
don't
quite
understand
that
statement
of
your
remarks.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
you
do
not
think
the
department
of
justice
could
seek
an
injunction
on
behalf
of
federal
trade
commission
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
couldn't
--
i
gather
from
what
you
say
that
you
don't
believe
to
department
of
justice
could
seek
an
injunction
on
behalf
of
federal
trade
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
absent
as
the
suit
by
the
department
of
justice?
justice
byron
r.
white
most
would
be
able
to
big
(inaudible)
actually
if
this
statement
being
brief
or
merely
true
i
suppose,
this
is
the
question
of
the
department
of
justice
--
actually
the
lawyers
with
the
federal
trade
commission
and
then
the
question
of
which
court,
it
goes
into.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
they
said
it
wasn't
so
explicitly
in
the
committee
report,
they've
said
that
plain
black
and
white
that
the
federal
trade
commission
has
no
such
norm.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
agree
with
you,
it
is
a
binding
but
in
terms
of
--
at
least
you
have
to
--
but
that's
at
least
what
was
committee
report?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
committee
is
confusing
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor,
do
you
know
of
any
instances
in
which
mostly
department
of
justice
and
federal
trade
commission
has
moved
against
the
same
anti-trust
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
sure
they
didn't
move
against
the
same
violation
in
a
one
criminal
and
one
civil
and
the
one
of
the
chemical
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
quite,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
the
way
it
looks
that
read
out
to
me,
but
you
thought
so
--
.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
agree
with
the
senate
report
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
it
could
do
that
then
the
suit
could
just
sit
there,
couldn't
it
if
they
got
a
new
temporary
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
none
came
to
vote.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)

(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
you
disagree
with
transamerica
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
was
the
perfectly
sound
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
federal
--
so
the
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
grant
an
injunction
that
the
suit
for
the
federal
trade
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
that's
