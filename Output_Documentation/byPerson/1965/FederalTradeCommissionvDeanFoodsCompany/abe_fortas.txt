justice

fortas

if
the
federal
trade
commission
had
entered
an
order
here
prohibiting
merger
or
requiring
divestiture,
the
respondents
would
then
would
have
a
choice
of
courts
of
appeals,
would
they
not,
that
is
to
say
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
were
to
have
a
choice
of
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
court
of
appeals.
not
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
they
would've
had
a
choice
so
that
it's
by
no
means
forgone
conclusion
that
the
case
would
ultimately
have
gone
at
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
other
hand
if
the
federal
trade
commission
decided
that
case
had
not
been
made
out
and
dismissed
the
complaint
then
the
federal
trade
commission
would
not
have
had
an
appeal,
would
it?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
--
if
this
case
was
ever
to
go
through
court
of
appeals,
the
choice
of
the
court
of
appeals
would've
been
the
respondents.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
they
didn't
quite
say
that,
did
they,
as
i
believe,
you
have
pointed
out
earlier.
the
court
said
that
the
federal
trade
commission
had
no
authority
to
bring
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
other
words
that
it
had
no
standing
in
effect
and
that
there
was
nothing
that
properly
before
the
court
--
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
that
it's
the
same
thing
to
say
that
trade
commission
had
no
authority
to
bring
the
case
on
one
hand,
on
the
other
hand,
to
say
that
court
of
appeals
itself
has
no
jurisdiction?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
but
legally
and
conceptually,
do
you
think
those
two
things
are
the
same
and
you
said
question
of
standing
as
the
trade
commission's
question
of
jurisdiction
of
the
court?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
the
parties
and
without
a
case
before
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
contended
that
there
is
something
peculiar
in
this
particular
merger
that
would
make
it
impossible
for
the
trade
commission
to
do
what
it
has
done
in
other
cases,
many
other
cases
which
is
after
the
consummation
of
the
merger
to
enter
an
order
requiring
divestiture.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
something
--
is
it
--
you
rely
upon
some
peculiarities
of
this
case
that
would
make
subsequent
divestiture
in
the
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
only
case
in
which
trade
commission
has
tried
to
secure
that
sort
of
relief?
justice
abe
fortas
knew
that
the
what
was
coming?
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
the
anti-trust
bar
has
realized
that
there
was
a
certain
desire
on
the
acts
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
(voice

--
(voice

justice
abe
fortas
who
said
that?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
quite
what
you
mean
mr.
chaffetz?
justice
abe
fortas
i
said
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
didn't
really,
what
shall
i
say
hope
that
the
trade
commission
would
relinquish
jurisdiction
to
the
department
of
justice.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
chaffetz,
did
the
trade
commission
ask
the
parties
to
enter
into
an
economist
stipulation
which
would
provide
a
means
for
divestiture
in
the
even
that
this
--
that
they
showed
its
order?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
--
what
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
know
do
you
not
that
trade
commission
has
workout
such
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
but
are
you
telling
me
now
that
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
and
did
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
regardless
of
whose
back
was
broken
or
not
broken,
did
they
propose
to
you
such
stipulation?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
chaffetz,
because
i'm
asking
whether
the
federal
trade
commission
proposed
stipulation
at
the
time
that
you
know
and
i
know
and
have
entered
into
before
which
would
permit
effectuation
of
a
divestiture
order
that
were
entered
and
now
you're
telling
me
that
the
--
you
run
a
trade
commission
proposed
a
provision
in
such
stipulation.
