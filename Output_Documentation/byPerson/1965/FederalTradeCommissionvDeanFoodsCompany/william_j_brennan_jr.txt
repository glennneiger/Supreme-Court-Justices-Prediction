william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
notice
at
page
32
that
you
deal
with
the
senate
report
to
which
that
dean's
brief
refers,
do
you
know
anywhere
else
in
your
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
know
what
this
is
on
its
face,
the
brief
does
have
the
right
to
impress
the
attorney
general
to
seek
such
action
on
its
behalf
and
there's
senate
report
â€“
coming
from
the
senate
report,
you
don't
have
that
any?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
what
you're
saying
is
that
yes
you
have
the
right
to
seek
such
action
on
its
behalf
means
in
the
sense
that
you're
talking
about
and
the
original
section
7
suit
in
the
district
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
any
suggestion
why
congress
has
been
so
reluctant
to
clear
this
thing
up?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
get
back
to
one
moment
mr.
chaffetz.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
said
no
question
here
at
jurisdiction
of
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
you
used
the
standing
argument,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
quite
sure,
i
follow
a
chat.
you're
not
going
to
say
that
this
all
turns
on
standing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
won't
say
withheld
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
nothing
what
you
expressly
denied
the
authority.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
justice
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
you
don't
have
to
--
none
jurisdiction.
