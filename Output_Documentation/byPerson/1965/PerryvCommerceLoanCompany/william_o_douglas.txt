you
don't
know
whether
the
plan
would
be
worked
out
successfully,
but
it
contemplates
full
payment,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice

douglas
that
doesn't
help
us
very
much
because
they're
just
as
many
cases
on
the
other
side.
justice
william
o.
douglas

there
are
quite
a
few

anyway.
