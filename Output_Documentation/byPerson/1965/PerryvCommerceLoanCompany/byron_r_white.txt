justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
was
the
--
what
was
the
prior
bankruptcy?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
--
there's
nothing
in
this
case
then
that
raises
issue
whether
a
prior
wage
earner's
plan
would
bar
a
subsequent
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
a
straight
or
prior
straight
bankruptcy
was
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
involve
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
an
earlier
straight
bankruptcy?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
the
--
was
this
plan,
that
was
filed,
simply
for
an
extension?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
if
he
paid
up
--
he
paid
up
in
accordance
with
the
plan,
is
he
required
to
get
a
discharge?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
this
isn't
the
kind
of
a
discharge
the
act
is
talking
about,
why
this
section
--
this
doesn't
apply
at
all
because
it
talks
about
--
committed
an
act
which
would
bar
the
discharge
of
this
particular
bankrupt.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
wasn't
--
wouldn't
get
a
discharge
at
all
while
this
section
is
holding
him
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
gets
discharge
in
a
sense
that
he
might
have
paid
up
all
the
debts
within
the
plan,
but
somebody
forgot
to
file
within
the
times
provided
by
57
or
something.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
“provided
for
under
the
plan”?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
--
how
about
other
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
a
fellow
who
didn't
file?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
that
you're
position
--
from
your
position,
it
necessarily
follows
that
if
you
filed
a
bank
--
a
petition
under
chapter
xiii
just
by
way
of
extension
and
paid
up
in
full
according
to
the
plan
in
1960,
and
then
in
1964,
you
filed
another
identical
petition
for
an
extension
that
that
such
petition
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
should
be
dismissed?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
disagree
then
with
the
tenth
circuit?
