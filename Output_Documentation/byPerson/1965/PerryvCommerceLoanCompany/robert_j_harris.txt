mr.
robert
j.
harris
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
this
matter
known
as
in
re
perry
comes
for
this
court
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit
which
judgment
was
entered
on
the
25th
of
january,
1965.
writ
of
certiorari
was
filed
here
and
granted
on
october
25,
1965.
if
it
please
the
court,
there's
really
no
--
there's
no
question
involved
here
except
one
very
simple
claim.
the
issues
can
be
resolved
to
one
issue.
can
a
wage
earner
be
permitted
to
file
a
chapter
xiii
proceeding
wherein
he
asks
for
an
extension
of
time
to
pay
his
bills
in
full,
when
he
has
received
a
prior
discharge
in
straight
bankruptcy
within
six
years
of
filing
the
extension
plan
under
the
chapter
xiii?
now
it's
important
to
the
issue
to
distinguish
between
a
composition
and
an
extension
and
i
mean
a
wage
earner
plan
by
way
of
composition
or
wage
earner
plan
by
way
of
extension
because
provision
is
made
for
both
proceedings
under
the
chapter
xiii
act,
but
whether
this
is
a
--
for
the
fact
that
this
is
an
extension
plan,
is
of
primary
importance,
the
decision
of
this
case.
composition
of
course
is
where
the
debtor
would
say,
“i
can't
pay
my
debts
in
full.
i
propose
to
pay
so
much
on
a
dollar
--
50
cents,
75
cents
on
a
dollar.
the
creditors
will
go
along
with
me
and
consent
to
it,
then
within
the
time
limits
of
a
chapter
xiii
act
of
three
years.
i
could
pay
off
50
to
75
cents
on
a
dollar,”
that's
a
composition.
he
has
been
paying
his
debts
in
full.
an
extension
plan
is
where
the
debtor
says
to
the
court,
“i
want
to
pay
my
bills
in
full,
a
100%,
i
want
to
pay
my
secured
creditors
a
100%,
my
unsecured
creditors
a
100%,
all
i
want
is
time.
i
want
a
three-year
period
or
less
in
some
cases
to
pay
my
bills
in
full.
i
want
the
protection
of
the
court,
stay
suits
against
me
and
garnishments,
so
that
i
hold
my
job
and
pay
my
debts,”
that's
what
an
extension
plan
is.
now
that's
what
perry
filed
in
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky.
he
filed
a
wage
earner
plan
in
which
he
said,
“i
owe
about
$1,400
and
i
want
to
pay
them
--
my
debts
in
full
both
secured
and
unsecured
creditors.
i
make
so
much
money
a
month
and
i
have
to
pay
my
rent,
food,
utilities,
and
transportation,
and
etcetera.
i
have
$60
left
and
this
$60
a
month
was
taken
out
of
my
wages
or
will
pay
my
debts
in
less
than
the
three-year
period,
in
fact
about
28
months.”
and
he
asked
the
court,
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
to
confirm
the
plan.
but
a
motion
was
filed
by
one
of
the
secured
creditors
that
had
a
mortgage
on
certain
furniture,
it
was
listed
in
the
plan,
it
would
have
been
paid
in
full.
the
commerce
loan
objected
to
confirmation,
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
deny
confirmation.
the
referee
sustained
the
motion,
denied
confirmation.
the
matter
was
taken
to
the
district
judge.
the
referee's
opinion
was
affirmed
subsequently
it
was
taken
to
u.s.
circuit
court
for
the
sixth
district
and
was
affirmed,
and
we're
here
on
this
matter
today.
mr.
robert
j.
harris
the
prior
bankruptcy
was
a
straight
bankruptcy
filed
about
four
and
a
half
years
prior
to
the
wage
earner
petition.
it
was
--
that
was
recited
in
his
petition.
in
his
chapter
xiii
petition,
he
indicated
an
answer
to
one
of
the
questions
in
the
petition,
had
he
filed
any
bankruptcy
before
and
he
said,
“yes.
i
filed
a
bankruptcy
petition
in
1959
and
received
the
discharge
in
1959”
and
the
chapter
xiii
petition
was
filed
about
four
--
four
and
a
half
years
later
in
1963.
that
was
a
matter
of
record
in
the
petition
itself
that
he
had
received
a
discharge
in
straight
bankruptcy
within
the
six-year
period.
now,
there
are
many
--
mr.
robert
j.
harris
well,
--
mr.
robert
j.
harris
whether
you
could
file
two
successive
wage
earner
plans?
mr.
robert
j.
harris
--
in
six
years.
well,
holmes
--
the
holmes
case
decided
you
could,
the
tenth
circuit
decide
--
mr.
robert
j.
harris
that's
not
involved
here.
mr.
robert
j.
harris
earlier
straight
bankruptcy.
these
are
not
two
successive
wage
earner
plans.
now,
there's
plenty
of
argument,
if
it
please
the
court,
on
a
philosophical
and
sociological
ground,
but
we
want
to
meet
the
statutory
objections
head-on
in
this
case.
and
all
the
while,
we'll
dwell
on
the
sociological
aspects
of
it,
i
still
feel
that
the
congressional
intent
as
indicated
by
the
chapter
xiii
statutes
was
that
this
relief
which
we
seek,
wage
earner
plan
by
way
of
extension,
is
afforded
to
any
wage
earner
regardless
of
the
fact
that
he
has
had
prior
relief
under
the
bankruptcy
act
within
six
years.
and
i
don't
want
to
burden
the
court,
but
these
statutes
are
technical
and
important
and
i
don't
want
to
even
paraphrase
them
and
at
time
to
time
i
will
be
verbatim.
a
section
of
the
code,
i
would
like
to
indicate
first
to
the
court
the
contents
of
a
petition
in
chapter
xiii,
which
is
section
623
of
the
chapter
xiii
act,
and
same
section
1023
of
title
11.
a
petition
filed
under
this
chapter
shall
state
that
the
debtor
is
insolvent
or
unable
to
pay
his
bills
as
they
may
mature
and
he
desires
to
effect
a
composition
or
an
extension
out
of
his
future
earnings.
and
i
call
the
attention
of
the
court
that
here
a
composition
or
an
extension
is
contemplated
or
both
by
the
chapter
xiii
act,
but
in
this
particular
case,
the
debtor
perry
proposed
to
pay
his
bills
in
full
and
only
asked
for
an
extension
of
time.
the
treatment
is
the
crux
of
the
whole
case.
now,
it
may
run
through
the
minds
of
the
members
of
this
court,
“well,
why
is
it
that
this
debtor
having
had
the
advantage
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
proceed
to
discharge
some
four
years
prior
--
why
is
he
now
again
in
this
financial
dilemma?”
and
i
say
that
that
probably
does
run
to
the
minds
--
run
through
your
minds,
but
i
would
add
to
this,
to
this
question,
why
is
it
that
this
debtor
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
others
throughout
the
country
had
found
that
bankruptcy
is
just
not
the
solution
to
their
problems
and
there's
no
question
to
what
--
that
a
straight
bankruptcy
does
not
solve
the
financial
problems
of
the
lower
one-third
of
a
segment
of
our
society.
we're
dealing
with
wage
earners
who
live
from
one
pay
day
to
the
next.
they're
the
ones
who
file
bankruptcy.
they're
the
ones
that
over
extend
themselves
in
installment
buying.
they
cannot
resist
the
sales
pressures
for
the
various
credit
houses.
they're
the
ones
that
have
to
have
credit.
if
they
get
sick
or
they
laid
off
for
matter
of
few
weeks,
they
need
credit
to
survive.
and
of
course,
thousands
and
thousands
of
them
find
themselves
in
financial
space
where
bankruptcy
has
been
their
hopeful
solution.
but
why
is
it
that
they
return
to
the
lawyer
and
say,
“well,
here
i
am
again
--
two
years,
three
years,
i'm
back
in
financial
trouble.”
we
lawyers
that
practicing
in
the
bankruptcy
field,
find
this
occurs
more
and
more.
and
we've
sought
a
solution
and
we
feel
that
chapter
xiii
is
the
solution.
but
there
are
several
reasons
why
they
get
back
in
financial
trouble.
in
the
first
place,
they're
not
of
the
most
intelligent
type
of
person.
they're
the
low
economic
group,
and
they
are
constantly
bombarded
by
furniture
stores,
appliance
stores,
used
car
dealers,
that
as
soon
as
they
see
that
bankruptcy
petition
in
the
paper,
they
say,
“well,
here
is
a
man
that
can't
go
bankrupt
for
six
more
years.
he's
a
pretty
good
risk.”
so
this
bankrupt
is
solicited
by
various
firms
selling
various
merchandise
and
he's
a
human
being.
he
wants
to
provide
things
for
his
family
that
other
people
do
and
he
doesn't
realize
that
again,
he's
over
extending
himself.
he
doesn't
look
out
for
the
rainy
day,
but
there
are
two
or
three
other
considerations
why
he
gets
into
trouble.
he
can't
go
to
a
legitimate
financial
institutions
for
help
after
he's
been
bankrupt.
an
emergency
arises
and
it
doesn't
take
very
much
to
be
in
an
emergency
in
this
man's
household,
a
few
weeks
off
work,
and
the
gas
electric
may
be
ready
to
shut
off.
so,
where
is
he
to
go?
he
invariably
will
go
back
to
a
finance
company
that
he
has
previously
discharged
in
bankruptcy.
he
hasn't
paid
them.
he
hasn't
paid
the
deficiency
balance.
it
may
be
a
deficiency
on
a
car,
a
furniture,
or
a
just
note,
well,
but
he
hasn't
paid
them.
but
they
haven't
forgotten
about
it
or
they're
still
holding
that
note,
the
balance.
so
one
day,
he
wanders
in
their
office.
he
needs
money.
he
needs
a
$100.
maybe
it's
just
to
buy
christmas
toys
for
his
children
but
he
still
needs
a
$100,
maybe
it's
to
turn
on
the
gas
electric
say.
so
they
say,
“yes,
we'll
loan
you
the
$100,
but
you
have
to
renew
our
old
balance.”
mr.
robert
j.
harris
you
have
to
renew
our
old
balance,
our
old
--
the
balance
that
you
discharged
in
bankruptcy.
if
you
reinstate
the
entire
account,
we'd
loan
you
this
extra
money.
mr.
robert
j.
harris
that's
after
--
it
may
not
even
be
after
the
discharge,
maybe
after
his
first
meeting
with
creditors,
but
generally,
it's
after
discharge.
it
may
be
a
year,
two,
three,
four
years
later.
mr.
robert
j.
harris
in
this
case,
i
don't
say
that's
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
j.
harris
it's
pertinent
because
i'm
explaining
to
the
court
that
we're
not
just
considering
perry
case.
we're
considering
of
thousands
of
other
cases
just
like
perry
that's
in
financial
trouble
that
needs
the
help
of
a
chapter
xiii
act.
now,
what
relief
can
we
afford
this
debtor,
if
chapter
xiii
is
not
available
to
him?
he
can't
go
bankrupt
for
six
years
and
he's
still
within
the
six-year
statute.
that's
elementary,
he
can't
file
a
bankruptcy
petition
except
once
every
six
years.
we
feel
that
the
congress
intended
that
the
chapter
xiii
act,
the
extension
plan
is
provided
there
under,
should
be
made
available
to
any
debtor
regardless
of
the
fact
that
he's
received
a
discharge
within
six
years
or
not
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
some
of
the
pertinent
statutes.
now
before
chapter
xiii
was
ever
enacted,
we
had
section
14
(c)
of
chapter
iii
of
the
bankruptcy
act
or
otherwise
known
as
section
32
(c)
of
tile
11.
this
is
been
on
the
books.
it's
been
amended
a
good
many
times.
the
statute
worked
long
before
chapter
xiii
was
ever
enacted.
it
provides,
if
i
may
read
the
pertinent
part
of
it,
“the
court
shall
grant
the
discharge
unless
satisfied
that
the
bankrupt
has
committed
or
failed
to
do
one
or
more
of
eight
different
things.”
six
of
these
implied
guilt
such
as
falsifying
the
schedules,
concealing
assets,
making
false
financial
statements.
six
of
them
in
applied
guilt.
the
last
one
is
failure
to
pay
the
cost,
but
number
five,
the
one
we're
concerned
about.
14
(c),
paragraph
5,
subsection
5,
unless
the
court
shall
grant
the
discharge
unless
satisfied
that
the
bankrupt
has
any
proceeding,
under
this
title,
commenced
within
six
years
prior
to
the
date
of
a
filing
of
the
petition
in
bankruptcy,
been
granted
a
discharge
or
had
a
composition
or
a
wage
earner's
plan
by
way
of
composition
confirmed
under
this
act.
now
the
phrase
“or
had
a
composition
or
a
wage
earner's
plan
by
way
of
composition”
was
added
in
1938
when
chapter
xiii
was
enacted.
but
it
is
significant,
that
when
14
(c)
was
amended
because
of
the
chapter
xiii
act,
congress
eliminated
the
wage
earner
plan
by
way
extension.
it
seems
to
me
to
imply
that
they
did
not
intend
for
the
so-called
guilt
statute
as
we
call
14
(c)
to
apply
to
a
man
that
wanted
the
protection
of
court
to
pay
his
bills
in
full.
mr.
robert
j.
harris
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
harris
i
think
it's
relevant,
your
honor,
yes.
if
you
will
permit
me
to
refer
to
the
other
sections
in
the
chapter
xiii
act,
which
i'm
about
to,
you'll
bear
with
me.
section
656
(a)
of
chapter
xiii
is
the
confirmation
section
where
--
when
a
plan
shall
be
confirmed.
now,
the
section
provides
that
the
referee
has
to
find
several
things
before
he
can
confirm
a
plan.
he
must
find
first
that
the
provisions
of
this
act
have
been
complied
with.
he
must
find
the
best
interest
of
the
creditors.
and
he
must
find
that
the
plan
is
fair,
equitable,
and
reasonable,
and
feasible.
and
also
he
must
find
that
the
debtor
has
not
been
guilty
of
any
of
the
acts
or
failed
to
perform
any
of
the
duties
which
would
be
a
bar
to
the
discharge
of
a
bankrupt.
so,
in
view
of
this
section,
we
have
to
determine
did
congress
intend
then
to
refer
section
656
fact,
to
section
14
(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
that
would
be
a
good
question,
except
for
the
provisions
of
section
602
of
chapter
xiii.
mr.
robert
j.
harris
you
will
find
section
602
printed
in
the
appellee's
brief
at
page
3.
mr.
smith,
i
think,
cites
section
602.
section
602
provides
that
provisions
of
chapters
i
to
vii
inclusive
of
this
title
shall
insofar
as
they
are
not
inconsistent
or
in
conflict
with
the
provisions
of
this
chapter,
apply
in
proceedings
under
this
chapter.
the
provisions
of
chapters
i
to
vii
inclusive
so
apply,
if
they're
not
inconsistent
or
in
conflict
with
chapter
xiii.
included
in
chapters
i
to
vii,
is
obviously
chapter
iii
and
section
14
(c)
which
is
the
guilt
statute,
the
discharge
sentence
statute.
now
it
submitted
that
congress
certainly
intended
that
a
wage
earner
plan
was
a
special
proceeding.
it
was
special
remedy
to
cure
a
special
ill
and
by
placing
--
by
passing
section
602
they
indicated
that
if
the
bankruptcy
act,
especially
the
discharge
section
within
six
years,
is
in
conflict
with
the
intent
of
the
basic
purpose
of
chapter
xiii
than
is
to
give
way
to
chapter
xiii.
and
that
is
the
theory
upon
which
the
court's
have
reasoned
in
holding
that
the
six-year
bar
does
not
apply
to
wage
earner
plan.
and
we
feel
that
it's
born
out
by
the
fact
that
in
amending
section
14
(c),
after
the
wage
earner
plan
was
placed
on
statute
books,
they
purposely
left
out
any
mention
of
the
wage
earner
plan
by
way
of
extension.
they
referred
to
wage
earner
plan
by
way
of
composition,
yes.
that's
when
where
he
settles
his
debts
and
doesn't
pay
them
in
full.
but
to
encourage
a
man,
a
debtor
--
a
wage
earner
to
pay
his
obligations
in
full,
it
was
--
to
me
most
assuredly,
the
congressional
intent
that
nothing
in
section
14,
unless
it's
some
fraud
of
course,
but
the
other
six
grounds
in
section
14
with
no
doubt,
if
he
was
guilty
of
any
fraudulent
acts,
yes.
but
the
fifth
ground,
having
received
the
discharge
within
the
six
years,
would
not
preclude
him
from
participating
in
the
benefits
of
extension
plan.
now
surely
congress
had
in
mind
that
its
better
to
lend
assistance
--
lend
the
assistance
of
the
courts
in
staying
suits,
garnishments,
preventing
this
man
from
losing
his
job.
keep
him
as
an
active
and
productive
member
of
society.
it's
better
to
do
that
than
just
to
flatly
say,
“well,
if
you've
been
bankrupt
before,
you
can't
come
into
the
court
again
even
for
a
wage
earner
plan.”
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
in
view
of
all
these
statutes
and
of
the
sociological
and
philosophical
benefits
that
derived
here,
definitely
the
intent
was
that
this
wage
--
the
wage
earner
is
entitled
to
the
benefits
regardless
of
having
--
mr.
robert
j.
harris
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
harris
well,
the
discharge
section
is
ambiguous.
it
is
true
that
--
mr.
robert
j.
harris
that's
true.
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
j.
harris
he
gets
a
discharge.
they
call
it
a
discharge
but
actually
it's
unnecessary.
section
1060
--
mr.
robert
j.
harris
well,
the
wording
--
the
wording
of
section
1060
is
specifically
this.
when
the
provisions
of
the
plan
have
been
complied
with
by
the
debtor
and
all
payments
made
under
the
plan
are
completed,
the
court
shall
enter
an
order
discharging
the
debtor
from
all
his
debts
provided
for
under
the
plan.
mr.
robert
j.
harris
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
harris
well,
--
mr.
robert
j.
harris
if
he
didn't
file,
he's
still
would
be
discharged.
if
he
didn't
accept
the
plan
or
if
he
--
if
he
was
notified,
he
got
proper
notice
and
assumed
that
it
did,
and
he
didn't
come
in
under
the
plan,
he'd
end
up
the
majority
of
creditors'
debt
and
he
wanted
to
sit
back
for
three
years
and
not
participate
in
the
plan,
then
he
would
be
discharged.
mr.
robert
j.
harris
what
little
time
i
have
left,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
j.
harris
thank
you.
mr.
robert
j.
harris
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
in
answer
to
mr.
smith‘s
statement
that
for
making
a
mess
of
things
in
cincinnati
court
through
the
administration
of
chapter
xiii,
i
would
like
to
say
to
this
court
that
mr.
william
schumacher
who
is
present
in
this
court
and
he's
our
trustee,
disburses
a
$100,000
a
month
to
creditors
to
chapter
xiii
proceedings
that
would
otherwise
be
lost
and
that's
a
$100,000
a
month
put
into
the
economy
and
i
don't
call
that
much
of
a
mess.
now,
justice
black
in
answer
to
your
question
as
to
whether
this
plan
is
incorporated
included
in
the
record,
it
is
your
honor.
at
pages
4,
5,
and
6,
the
complete
plan
setting
forth
100%
payment
of
both
secured
--
mr.
robert
j.
harris
it
provides
a
payment
of
6%
interest
on
secured
accounts,
6%
interest.
now,
justice
stewart
raised
the
question
of
the
discharge
that
provided
wherein
the
wage
earner
is
unable
to
comply
with
to
--
through
the
plan
within
three
years
because
of
circumstances
beyond
his
control.
that
is
true.
in
the
schlageter
case,
i
think
based
its
opinion
upon
the
fact
that
he
could
get
a
discharge.
but
my
answer
to
that
would
be
that
if
that
situation
happened
and
the
creditor
had
not
received
a
100%,
then
he
could
make
a
motion
to
dismiss
at
that
time
or
he
could
oppose
the
application
for
discharge
if
the
man
had
gotten
the
discharge
in
bankruptcy
within
six
years.
so
the
--
what
schlageter
is
doing,
they're
anticipating
if
the
creditor
had
not
received
the
100%,
he
could
then
come
in
to
the
court
and
say,
“well,
i'm
going
to
oppose
the
discharge
because
i
haven't
gotten
my
100%
like
he
said.”
and
he's
got
another
discharge
within
six
years
and
this
would
tantamount
to
a
second
discharge.
thank
you.
