where
is
it
printed
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
composition
planned
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
composition
plan
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
was
a
plan
which
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
an
extension
plan
was
in
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
think
about
the
provision
that
says,
“not
inconsistent
with?”
you
said
that
he's
relying
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
inconsistent
with
this
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
this
a
plan
to
pay
this
debt
in
full?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
the
debt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
asking
is
did
he
agree
in
this
plan
to
pay
all
of
the
debts
in
full?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
he
agree
to
pay
if
extended,
in
full?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
him
to
say
that
he
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
it
says
is
100%
payment
upon
acceptance
of
the
plan
for
secured
creditors.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
should
be
dealt
with
severely
for
any
terms,
but
only
upon
written
acceptance
of
the
plan.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
it
provides
for
payment
in
full
to
the
secured
creditors,
what
does
it
provide
with
the
reference
to
the
unsecured
creditors?
justice
hugo
l.
black
doesn't
everybody
get
his
money
under
this
plan
if
he
goes
through
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
would
not
get
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose,
it
took
three
years
as
it
provided
here,
would
everybody
get
his
money?
all
the
creditors
get
their
money
paid
in
full,
100%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
point
there
i
assume,
there
might
possibly
be
a
difference
payment
in
full
--
i'm
not
saying
it
would,
payment
in
full
and
payment
in
part
when
he
asked
for
his
discharge,
suppose
it
was
carried
out
exactly
as
contemplated,
would
it
pay
all
the
debtors
100%
in
full,
creditors
a
100%
in
full?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you're
talking
about
what
has
been
done,
the
statute
--
this
plan
proposes,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
does
not
make
any
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
had
determined
--
suppose
he
had
determined
it
was
feasible
and
pure
loan
company
had
not
filed
this
objection,
would
they
have
been
paid
in
full
if
the
plan
was
carried
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
suppose
you
had
not
been
there
and
that
you
had
not
filed,
does
it
propose
that
it
would
be
paid
out
as
full,
a
100%
on
the
dollar,
that
was
his
plan?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
may
not
make
any
difference
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
provide
for
payment
of
interest?
