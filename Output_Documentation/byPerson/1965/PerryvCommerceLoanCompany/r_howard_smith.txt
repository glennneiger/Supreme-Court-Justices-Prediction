mr.
r.
howard
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
has
now
run
the
gamut
of
its
very
life
existence.
it
started
in
the
--
before
a
referee
in
united
states
court
[inaudible]
division
in
kentucky.
back
in
august
the
1963,
a
decision
was
granted
on
this
motion
--
a
motion
by
commerce
loan
company
to
dismiss
or
sustained
by
the
referee
in
an
opinion
written,
as
i
recall,
in
december
of
the
same
year,
1963.
sometime
later,
almost
a
year
later,
judge
swinford
of
the
united
states
court,
eastern
district
of
kentucky
affirmed
the
referee's
finding
of
dismissing
the
petition
and
also
wrote
an
opinion
in
connection
with
it.
all
--
both
opinions
maybe
found
in
the
brief
for
the
appellant
--
appellee
herein.
the
--
judge
swinford's
decision
was
appealed
to
the
sixth
circuit
in
cincinnati.
and
on
january
25th
last
year,
a
year
ago,
almost
to
the
day,
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
judge
swinford
and
judge
lee.
the
case
is
now
before
this
court
on
writ
of
certiorari.
on
the
last
appearance
before
the
sixth
circuit,
the
court
was
very
patient
in
hearing
my
opponent
through
--
to
his
logical
conclusion
of
30
minutes
and
it
now
goes
to
present
for
the
appellee,
the
conference
use,
we
were
advised
by
all
those
bodies
that
we
would
be
hearing
from
them
briefly.
that
indicates
to
or
did
indicate
to
me
at
least
that
the
court
are
pretty
well
satisfied
[inaudible]
the
law
in
this
matter
and
on
what
decision
would
be.
i
have
no
way
of
course
foretelling
how
this
court
feels
on
the
matter
so,
little
by
little
i'll
have
to
meet
the
issues
as
has
been
presented
here
by
my
distinguished
opponent.
first
of
all
gentlemen,
this
case
is
here
on
propositions
of
law.
the
facts
are
pretty
well
admitted,
facts
are
admitted.
i
don't
know
that
the
10-year
dues
should
be
taken
sociologically,
politically,
or
commercially
on
this
proposition.
it's
true
and
simple,
simply
a
construction
and
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
passed
by
congress
and
as
i
see
it,
admits
of
no
other
construction
or
interpretation,
but
all
the
statutory
provisions
of
chapter
xiii
are
as
follows.
this
is
on
page
3
of
the
brief
for
the
appellee,
if
you
care
to
follow
along.
section
602,
the
provisions
of
chapters
1
to
7,
dealing
with
chapter
xiii
inclusive
of
this
title,
shall
insofar
as
they
are
not
inconsistent
or
in
conflict
with,
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
apply
in
proceedings
under
this
chapter,
u.s.c.
a.
section
1002,
section
636
as
to
my
understanding
my
opponent
did
not
contend
--
did
not
read.
following
long
under
the
chapter
xiii
provision
says
this,
“we
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
provisions
of
this
chapter,”
that
is
chapter
xiii
that
is
“all
the
rights
and
privileges
and
duties
of
the
debtor
shall
be
the
same.”
are
we
to
interpret
from
that,
the
question
of
discharge,
discharge
ability?
why
most
certainly,
as
if
a
voluntary
petition
for
adjudication
of
bankruptcy
have
been
filed
under
the
decree
of
adjudication
had
been
entered
at
the
time
the
petition
on
this
chapter
was
filed,
11
u.s.c.
section
1036.
section
656
(a),
the
court
shall
confirm
the
plan
if
satisfied
that.
that
what?
that
the
debtor
has
not
been
guilty
of
any
acts
or
failed
to
perform
any
of
the
duties,
because
it
would
be
a
bar
to
discharge
the
bankruptcy.
by
the
provisions
of
chapter
iii,
section
14
(c)
of
the
act,
a
discharge
is
denied
if
the
bankrupt
has
committed
any
of
the
offenses
or
failed
to
perform
any
of
the
duties
specified
in
the
seven
numbered
clauses
including
clause
(5)
which
is
as
follows
-
section
14
--
quoting
section
14
(c),
the
court
shall
grant
the
discharge
unless
satisfied
that
the
bankrupt
has,”
subsection
(5),
“in
a
proceeding
under
this
title
commenced
within
six
years
prior
to
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
petition
in
bankruptcy
--
been
granted
a
discharge,
or
had
a
composition
or
a
wage
earner's
plan
by
way
of
composition
confirmed
under
this
act.
now
a
composition
under
the
act
of
extension,
are
exactly
one
and
the
same
for
discharge
purposes.
there's
no
distinction.
so
if
a
person
cannot
see
of
the
composition
within
a
year,
i
mean,
within
six
years
where
a
previous
bankruptcy
--
when
a
person
has
filed
a
petition
for
bankruptcy
and
been
discharged,
then
the
same
applies
to
an
extension.
that's
not
only
the
statute,
that's
the
law
interpreted
--
that's
what
the
decisions
bear
out.
i
would
like
to
read
a
decision
--
mr.
r.
howard
smith
sir?
mr.
r.
howard
smith
this
--
oh,
the
composition
plan
in
this
record?
mr.
r.
howard
smith
no,
sir.
there
was
no
composition
in
this
case.
this
is
--
mr.
r.
howard
smith
oh,
yes.
an
extension
plan
was
--
mr.
r.
howard
smith
yes,
sir.
yes.
that's
in
the
record,
your
honor.
there
have
been
two
decisions
squarely
on
the
point
of
this
case,
that's
schlageter
case
from
the
third
circuit
and
of
course
this
case
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit
and
there
are
numerous
decisions
from
district
courts,
numerous
of
it,
all
holding
that
you
cannot.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
this
law
--
mr.
r.
howard
smith
this
law
bars
it.
the
statute
bars
--
it
says
you
can't
do
it.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
yes,
sir,
positively.
in
the
in
re
nicholson
page
224
federal
--
federal,
224
f.
supp.,
page
773,
the
petitioner
or
wage
earner,
within
the
meaning
of
11
u.s.c.,
section
106,
subsection
(a)
filed
a
plan
for
extension
under
the
provisions
of
chapter
xiii
of
the
bankruptcy
act
as
amended.
the
plan
provided
for
the
payment
in
full
or
the
petitioner's
credits
within
three
years,
the
statement
for
affairs
and
the
petition
disclosed
that
she
had
been
granted
discharge
in
bankruptcy
on
july
14,
1960.
at
the
first
meeting,
[inaudible]
the
referee
found
that
the
proposed
plan
of
petitioner
was
feasible
and
that
it
had
been
accepted
by
the
two
secured
creditors
affected
by
the
plan
and
by
those
unsecured
creditors
who
had
filed
claims.
later,
the
petitioner
made
an
application
for
confirmation
of
plan.
subsequently,
the
referee
entered
an
order
denying
confirmation
and
dismissing
the
proceeding
that's
–
on
the
ground
that
petitioner
had
been
granted
a
discharge
in
bankruptcy
within
six
years.
the
next
proceeding,
the
filing
of
the
identical
petition.
the
cause
before
this
court
on
a
petition
for
review
such
order
describe
and
presents
the
issue
of
whether
such
discharge
is
barred
from
confirmation
of
the
plan
for
an
extension
under
the
said
chapter,
where
the
proposed
plan
has
been
accepted
by
the
creditors
and
meets
all
the
requirements
of
such
proceeding.
the
statutes
under
--
the
statutes
under
consideration
in
relevant
part
were
set
forth
in
the
margin
and
if
--
i
could
read
that
[inaudible].
the
petitioner
relies
upon
in
re
homes,
edins
versus
helzberg's
diamond
shops
incorporated.
i
have
grave
doubts
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
decision
in
the
homes
to
the
facts
presented
by
this
record.
the
issue
there
presumed
was
whether
a
wage
earner,
having
availed
himself
for
the
plan
for
extension
within
six
years
next,
proceeded
to
the
filing
of
another
plan,
is
barred
by
11
u.s.c.
subsection
(c)
(5).
so
you
can
see
that
answers
justice
white,
that
answers
your
question
right
there.
the
court
points
to
the
significant
truth
that
the
provisions
of
this
section
are
made
expressly
applicable
to
discharge
in
bankruptcy
compositions
and
wage
earner
plans
by
way
of
composition.
and
that
the
section
is
noticeably
silent
with
respect
to
a
plan
for
an
extension
of
time
to
which
to
pay
this
in
full,
which
of
course
of
what
my
opponent
says.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
well,
the
case
holds
exactly
the
same
thing
that
the
sixth
circuit
held,
the
case
before
here.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
and
the
sixth
circuit
cites
this
very
case.
also
i
might
say
your
honor,
that
in
this
same
decision,
i
want
to
call
this
to
your
attention
especially.
it
is
not
necessary
for
any
creditor
to
even
lieu
for
a
dismissal
of
petition
which
of
course
what
i
didn't
do.
i
moved
specifically
to
dismiss
this
case,
but
in
this
nicholson
case,
the
court
held
there,
the
district
court
held
there,
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
even
move,
if
the
law
is
plain,
that
is
the
duty
of
the
referee.
he
must
do
it.
he
must
upon
his
own
motion
dismiss
such
proceeding.
he
has
no
discretion
in
the
matter.
now,
that's
the
law.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
well,
that's
the
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
well,
i
don't
know
just
exactly
what
to
--
what
this
section
means,
but
i
can
put
--
i
can
tell
you
without
reading
the
decision,
you
might
read
the
dissenting
opinion
by
judge
hickenlooper
in
the
sixth
circuit.
the
same
--
that's
the
same
circuit
court
this
case
came
from
--
originated
from.
judge
hickenlooper
goes
into
some
detail,
that's
in
connection
with
the
case
of
goldberg,
in
re
goldberg,
the
citations
in
3
f.2d
series
454.
that
is
cited
in
my
brief.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
what
judge?
mr.
r.
howard
smith
your
honor,
please
sir,
regardless
what
mr.
harris
says
in
connection
with
paying
the
full,
he
could
pay
--
the
debtor
could
present
plan
in
60
days
or
six
months.
the
plan
could
follow
through
and
any
--
he
could
come
right
back
according
to
what
he
says,
he
could
come
right
back
with
another
action
within
six
months
thereafter.
that's
what
has
happened.
that
to
me
--
mr.
r.
howard
smith
well
no,
he
didn't
make
such
agreement
as
that
your
honor.
that
would
be
a
composition.
this
is
an
extension.
he's
asked
for
an
extension
under
the
wage
earner
plan.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
no,
sir.
there
was
no
such
agreement
to
that
effect.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
well,
regardless
of
what
he
did
or
what
he
--
he
couldn't
make
such
an
agreement.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
--
because
it
might
be,
that
i
don't
know
what
the
plan
was
--
the
court
didn't
determined
whether
or
not
this
was
feasible
or
not
feasible.
in
many
instances
the
time
limit
would
run
out.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
well,
that's
--
mr.
r.
howard
smith
that
would
determine
--
be
determined
by
judge
as
to
the
number
of
people
who
accepted
the
plan
and
carried
over
the
--
whether
or
not
it
would
pay
off
over
the
period
of
time,
within
three
years.
if
that
pay
out
within
three
years,
if
it
was
over
then
of
course,
he
could
not
pay
his
creditors
hardly
with
$1600.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
the
same.
the
same
situation
would
exist.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
not
necessarily,
not
always
your
honor.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
as
i
say,
it
might
be
that
the
three-year
period
that
the
plan
that
he
had
submitted
would
take
longer
than
three
years
to
pay
out.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
or
not.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
i
just
don't
know
your
honor.
i
couldn't
answer,
whether
it
would
or
not
--
mr.
r.
howard
smith
it
contemplates
it,
yes.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
that's
the
answer,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
absolutely.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
absolutely.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
exactly,
correct
sir.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
unless
(voice
overlap)
with
discharge
within
six
years
previously
--
mr.
r.
howard
smith
any
further
question?
mr.
r.
howard
smith
well,
this
is
a
new
proceeding
your
honor.
it's
been
on
the
books
for
about
almost
seven
years
--
almost
20
years,
but
it
had
last
three
or
four
years
since
--
the
fact
that
it
has
not
been
used
and
frankly
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
any
of
these
--
have
ever
paid
out
in
full.
i
just
don't
know
what
it
may
lead.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
he
propose
--
mr.
r.
howard
smith
i
guess
he
proposed
it
on
his
own
fashion.
as
to
what
is
feasible
or
not,
that's
another
matter.
the
court
in
this
particular
instance,
when
i
made
the
motion
didn't
determine
whether
it
was
feasible
or
not.
he
says
it's
against
the
law,
or
against
the
statute.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
your
honor,
it
was
the
duty
of
the
referee
the
very
moment
that
he
discover
--
that
he
discover
--
mr.
r.
howard
smith
--
what
my
motion
rather
was.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
according
to
his
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
r.
howard
smith
the
proposition
might
be
there,
but
the
fulfillment
of
it
maybe
something
else.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
that's
right
he
would
not.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
also
his
petition
would
be
dismissed
for
lack
of
--
of
the
plan.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
sorry?
mr.
r.
howard
smith
the
decision
i
presume,
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
largely
based
upon
the
schlageter
case
and
the
--
this
very
brief.
however,
just
for
the
first
to
course
in
mind,
i
would
like
to
read
the
--
i'd
like
to
read
the
decision
in
sixth
circuit
in
this
case
very
briefly.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
the
schlageter
case
--
i'd
like
to
read
the
schlageter
case
--
mr.
r.
howard
smith
the
schlageter
case
--
it
says,
the
following
of
provisions
of
chapter
iii
incorporated
by
reference
are
made
applicable
to
proceedings
on
chapter
xiii.
section
14
(c),
the
court
shall
grant
the
discharge
unless
satisfied
that
the
bankrupt
has,
in
a
proceeding
under
this
title,
commenced
within
six
years
prior
to
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
petition
in
bankruptcy
had
been
granted
a
discharge
or
had
a
composition
or
an
arrangement
by
way
of
composition,
by
wage
earner's
plan
by
way
of
composition,
confirmed
under
this
title,
11
u.s.c.
8
section
32
subsection
(c).
the
appellant
here
argues
that
since
his
plan
of
arrangement
proposed
it's
nothing
more
than
an
extension
of
time
within
which
he'd
pay
his
debts
and
not
a
discharged,
relief
under
chapter
xiii
is
not
barred
in
section
14
(c)
supra.
the
argument
is
based
upon
the
erroneous
interpretation
of
section
656
(a)
supra,
and
fails
to
take
into
consideration
section
660
and
section
661
of
that
act
of
11
u.s.c.1060
and
1061.
the
provisions
of
section
656
sub
6
--
mr.
r.
howard
smith
well,
the
section
--
that
case
holds
that
you
definitely
cannot
file
a
chapter
xiii
where
there's
been
a
previous
discharge
in
bankruptcy
within
the
six
years
previous
to
that
time.
mr.
r.
howard
smith
it's
what
it
holds.
i
might
also
add
your
honor
that
--
mr.
r.
howard
smith
well,
your
honor
i
don't
know
whether
--
i
doubt
that
very
much.
i'm
not
--
mr.
r.
howard
smith
quite
a
few
of
them.
there's
the
decision
from
macon,
georgia
in
the
case
of
arthur
hamilton
written
by
the
referee
down
there,
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
would
want
to
hear
that,
it's
somewhat
lengthy,
but
it
goes
into
dissertation
of
the
law
and
the
facts
and
it
holds
also
the
same
as
the
schlageter
case,
in
fact
precisely
as
schlageter
case
and
then
there
are
five
cases
on
appeal
in
the
fifth
circuit
from
district
court
of
the
middle
district
of
georgia.
two
of
the
cases
were
dismissed
by
referee
stewart,
mr.
smith,
the
other
three
were
dismissed
by
referee
algim
moby
jr.
the
referees
acted
on
their
motion
and
dismissing
these
cases
because
of
prior
bankruptcy
within
six
years
and
their
action
in
so
doing
was
approved
by
the
district
court
in
all
of
those
instances.
so,
i
have
my
doubts
as
to
the
number
--
i
believe
that
the
number
exceeds
your
honor
in
favor
of
the
schlageter
case
from
those
against
them.
we
do
submit
that
the
reasoning
seems
to
be
in
favor
of
schlageter
case.
i'm
sure
that
you're
familiar
with
the
wording
of
the
sixth
circuit
case,
it's
very
brief
into
the
point.
one
further
thing
that
the
court
--
we
believe
with
the
sixth
circuit
that
this
is
purely
and
simply
a
question
of
legislation,
it's
a
matter
for
the
congress
and
not
for
this
court.
there
are
many
reasons
for
that.
the
courts
are
not
equipped
and
set
up
to
handle
this
kind
of
administration.
they
rather
taken
to
do
and
since
they
have
held
elsewhere
and
they're
making
a
mess
of
things.
congress
can
set
up
appropriate
bureaus,
provide
the
appropriate
salaries
and
the
proper
rules
and
regulations.
the
matters
under
consideration
right
now
by
congress
and
it
had
--
it
was
the
last
session.
there
are
several
bills
before
the
congress
on
this
very
proposition
chapter
xiii.
it
may
be
that
some
legislation
in
this
field
is
needed.
we
are
inclined
to
believe
that
there
is.
we
do
think
that
the
society
is
not
wholly
dependent
upon
this
section
for
the
reason
that
most
state
have
receivership
rules
where
you
can
go
into
state
courts
and
ask
for
a
relief
on
wage
earner
--
on
wage
earner's
plans
so
they're
not
holding
without
relief.
now,
if
your
honor
please
--
if
your
honor
please,
there's
an
abuse
on
both
sides
because
there
are
many
bankrupt
--
repeaters
of
bankruptcy
who've
been
going
into
straight
bankruptcy
six
months
with
the
year
or
later
coming
right
back
having
the
same
number
of
debts
or
probably
more
so,
seeking
further
relief.
how
long
can
that
go
on?
our
court
dockets
are
burdened
or
were
burdened,
overburdened
with
this
classification
of
cases
until
this
decision.
now
it's
down
to
where
it
probably
should
be
under
the
chapter
xiii,
the
courts
will
have
nothing
to
do
to
handle
the
cases,
the
legal
cases
that
come
before
under
chapter
xiii
without
having
these
extra
legal
laws.
we
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
read
the
cases
schlageter,
also
the
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
here,
this
particular
case,
the
sixth
circuit.
the
nicholson
case
which
i
just
read
and
dissenting
opinion
put
in
the
goldberg
case.
we
would
like
to
have
you
consider
those
citations
and
render
your
decision.
so,
i
believe
that's
all
i
can
say
unless
there's
any
further
questions.
