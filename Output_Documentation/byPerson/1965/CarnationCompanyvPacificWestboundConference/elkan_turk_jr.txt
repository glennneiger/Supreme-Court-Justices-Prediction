mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
it's
discouraging,
this
late
in
an
argument,
to
go
back
to
the
beginning,
but
the
question
was
raised
of
mr.
ransom
as
to
what
we
conceive
really
to
be
the
nub
of
this
case
and
i
think
that
there's
some
difficulty
for
all
of
us
in
appreciating
that.
we
don't
know
really
whether
we
are
here
to
establish
whether
u.s.
navigation
against
cunard
and
far
east
conference
are
still
good
law
or
whether
we
are
here
just
to
determine
whether
they
are
good
law
but
some
little
corner
must
be
carved
out
of
a
doctrine
of
those
cases
to
permit
this
treble
damage
remedy
even
though
those
cases
are
still
in
full
force
and
effect
as
to
the
fact
situations
which
were
involved
in
them.
if
the
broad
question
is
“are
far
east
and
u.s.
navigation
against
cunard
still
good
law,”
we
submit
that
they
are
the
principle
on
which
they
were
decided
is
as
applicable
today,
as
it
was
then,
and
that
there
are
some
logical
inconsistencies.
in
allowing
this
private
party
the
right
to
seek
treble
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws
for
matters
totally
covered
under
the
shipping
act,
whereas,
those
cases
say
that
neither
a
private
party
nor
even
the
attorney
general
may
obtain
an
injunction
against
conduct
claimed
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws
but
also
thoroughly
covered
by
the
shipping
act.
it
seems
somewhat
anomalous
that
the
arm
of
the
united
states
government
which
has
the
responsibility
for
the
enforcement
of
administration
of
the
antitrust
laws
should
be
barred
from
coming
to
court
and
challenge
an
unfiled,
unapproved
agreements,
as
was
held
in
far
east
conference
against
the
united
states.
but,
that
this
antitrust
treble
damage
plaintiff
who
absolutely
gambled
by
not
filing
any
reparation
complaint
before
the
commission
for
his
rights
under
section
15
in
the
event
there
was
an
unapproved
agreement,
should
be
able
to
come
in
with
his
treble
damage
suit
and
succeed
when
he
could
under
section
22
of
the
act,
the
shipping
act,
have
had
full,
single
reparation
putting
him
in
on
a
par
with
all
other
shippers
and
not
giving
him
two-fold
preference
over
other
shippers.
the
attorney
general
says
that
the
power
of
the
federal
maritime
commission,
to
order
parties
to
cease
and
desist
from
violations
of
the
shipping
act,
renders
the
antitrust
injunction
remedy
superfluous.
we
say
the
same
logic
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
power
of
the
federal
maritime
commission
to
make
a
private
party
whole,
where
carriers
subject
to
the
act
have
enhanced
a
rate
by
an
agreement
which
has
not
been
filed
and
approved,
equally
renders
superfluous,
the
treble
damage
remedies
under
an
entirely
different
statutory
scheme
which
has
a
different
method
of
penalizing
parties
at
the
instance
of
the
government
and
uses
this
treble
damage
remedy
as
a
sort
of
auxiliary
enforcement
process.
now,
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
this
treble
damage
possibility
in
the
wings
may
cause
us
ocean
carriers
to
become
more
cautious
and
to
file
everything
with
the
commission
which,
in
the
past
or
possibly
in
the
future
as
was
done
in
this
very
case,
docket
872,
may
for
the
first
time
be
held
by
this
commission
to
be
a
matter
requiring
section
15
approval.
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
yes?
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
in
the
difficult
to
conceive
situation
in
which
a
private
party
claimed
he'd
been
damaged
by
some
collective
action
of
a
person
subject
to
the
shipping
act,
but
the
commission
upheld,
let's
say,
on
judicial
review
had
found
that
that
did
not
entitle
this
party
to
a
remedy
under
the
shipping
act,
not
because
he
just
didn't
prove
his
case
but
because
there
is
something
inherent,
either
substantively
or
procedurally,
in
the
shipping
act
which
denies
party
complainant
a
remedy
under
the
shipping
act,
then
one
of
the
predicates
of
supersession,
as
we
call
it,
would
be
absent.
he
couldn't
get
his
relief
under
the
shipping
act.
if
he
had
a
case
under
the
antitrust
laws,
he
would
be
entitled
to
proceed,
but,
i
suggest
to
you
it's
pretty
difficult
to
imagine
that
that
would
occur
because
section
15
of
the
shipping
act
so
thoroughly
and
completely
describes
anticompetitive
agreements
of
carriers
and
says
they
must
be
filed
and
that
the
commission
must
approve
them,
unless
it
makes
specified
findings
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
antitrust
laws,
they
have
to
do
with
carrier
regulatory
concepts,
discrimination,
public
interest,
detriment
to
commerce,
et
cetera,
we
submit
that
the
entire
philosophy
of
what
to
do
with
the
agreements
of
ocean
common
carriers
and
other
parties
described
in
section
1,
as
within
the
coverage
of
the
shipping
act
is
--
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
gets
us
to
that
perplexing
last
portion
of
the
opinion
in
far
east
conference
against
the
united
states
where
as
the
solicitor
general
suggested,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
“we'll
dismiss
here.
a
similar
suit
is
easily
instituted
later.”
now,
it
is
conceivable,
or
at
least
it
may
have
been
conceivable,
in
the
author
--
in
the
mind
of
the
author
of
that
opinion,
but
if
the
attorney
general
did
go
before
the
federal
maritime
commission,
(a)
the
commission
might
say
he
didn't
have
standing.
that's
discussed
in
the
opinion.
it's
considered
frivolous,
but
it
is
a
possibility
that
cannot
be
neglected.
if
the
attorney
general
had
filed
a
complaint
with
the
commission,
the
commission
might
have
said
“we
are
uncle
sam
just
as
much
as
you
are,
we're
not
going
to
listen
to
your
story
about
this”
or
it
is
conceivable
that
the
attorney
general
might
approve
to
state
of
facts
with
which
the
commission,
either
on
its
own
motion,
felt
incapable
of
adjudicating
or
on
court
review,
it
might
have
been
held
was
outside
the
ambit
of
the
commission's
powers,
and
that
would've
left
the
attorney
general
remedy
was
under
the
shipping
act.
and
then,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
indicated,
a
similar
suit,
namely
an
injunction
suit,
under
the
antitrust
laws
is
easily
instituted
later.
as
to
giving
you
a
specific
set
of
facts,
which
i
do
not
conceive
to
be
covered
by
section
15,
if
it
in
any
way
involves
restraint
of
competition
by
cooperative
action
of
ocean
common
carriers,
i
submit
to
you,
i
cannot
suggest
it.
i
don't
believe
that
others
can.
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
mr.
justice
warren,
without
undue
levity,
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
we
are
here
and
a
good
deal
of
this
court's
business
arises
because,
in
advance
of
these
complicated
arguments
and
contentions
which
resourceful
people
make
up
many
years
later,
congress
does
not
always
use
the
clearest
manner
of
expressing
its
purpose.
however,
if
one
refers
to
the
alexander
committee
report
which
was
the
underlying
source
of
the
shipping
act,
i
believe
that
one
can
discern
there
an
intent
whether
or
not
it
was
aptly
expressed
in
the
1916
congress
that
a
thorough
consideration
of
ocean
carrier
agreements
--
in
the
first
place,
they
did
not
start
off
by
considering
the
disadvantages.
they
started
off
by
considering
that
there
were
many
advantages
to
these
agreements
that
they
wanted
to
secure
and
they
recognize
that
the
only
way
they
could
secure
that
was
to
get
them
out
from
under
the
antitrust
laws.
then,
they
did
also
state
that
the
testimony
--
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
yes.
there's
no
reservation
in
the
committee's
consideration
of
the
securing
of
advantages.
these
advantages,
and
this
is
from
page
416
in
the
alexander
committee
report,
these
advantages,
the
committee
believes,
can
be
secured
only
by
permitting
the
several
lines
in
any
given
trade
to
cooperate
through
some
form
of
rate
and
pooling
agreement
under
government's
supervision
and
control.
now,
they
don't
say,
at
that
point,
whose
supervision
and
control,
but
if
you
go
on,
there
are
numbered
recommendations
that
the
committee
made.
and
number
two,
which
appears
on
pages
419-20
of
the
alexander
report,
is
that
all
carriers
engaged
in
the
foreign
trade
of
the
united
states,
parties
to
any
agreements,
understandings,
or
conference
arrangements,
hereinafter
referred
to,
be
required
to
file
for
approval
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
they,
at
that
time,
contemplated
the
icc
would
administer
this,
a
copy
of
all
written
agreements
or
a
complete
memorandum,
if
oral,
entered
into
with
other
steamship
lines,
et
cetera.
there
is
nothing
stated
about
exempting
only
approved
agreements.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
nothing
stated
about
exemption
at
all.
i
think
it's
clear
that
they
concede
that
by
adopting
this
specific
act,
which
covered
agreements
from
stem
to
stern
and
left
nothing
untouched,
there
was
no
scope
at
all
left.
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
i
must
agree
with
that
entirely.
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
yes.
but,
in
the
field
of
interstate
commerce,
we
sometimes
here
refer
to
as
completely
occupying
the
field.
this
is
no
subtle
repeal
by
an
implication
which
must
be
finally
broad.
we
got
a
statute
which
occupies
the
subject
of
ocean
carrier
agreements
completely
and
thoroughly
and
far
beyond
even
antitrust
coverage
because
there
are
some
agreements
--
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
no.
i
think
we're
at
some
pains
to
understand
why,
in
view
of
the
alexander
committee's
obvious
intent.
they
express
the
exemption
in
the
very
narrow
way
that
they
did.
i
think
mr.
ransom's
suggestion
is
a
helpful
one.
they
provided
the
penalties
for
dealing
with
non-filed
agreements
in
section
15
and
wanted
to
be
sure
that
if
you
did
go
the
right
route
and
get
your
approval
and
got
your
agreement
lawful
under
section
15,
you
would
not
somehow
be
left
with
some
contention
that,
nevertheless,
the
agreement
still
violated
the
antitrust
laws.
i
can't
say
--
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
well,
that
is
a
speculation
that
is
very
difficult
to
answer
these
50
years
later,
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
we
might
pose
an
equally
pertinent
question,
why
did
not
congress
in
the
shipping
act,
as
it
did
in
the
interstate
commerce
and
many
of
these
other
acts,
include
a
provision
saving
to
all
suitors
their
rights
and
remedies
under
the
common
law
and
all
other
statutes?
that
was
left
out.
i
submit
that
that
was
deliberate.
the
congress
was
aware
at
least
of
the
abilene
cotton
case
at
that
time.
it
was
not,
however,
aware
of
the
keogh
case
which
was
not
decided
in
19
--
until
1922
and
that
was
really
the
starting
point
of
supersession
as
distinguished
from
just
primary
jurisdiction
under
an
administrative
act.
in
keogh,
you
had
the
element
of
a
suit
for
treble
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
notwithstanding
this
savings
of
remedies
under
other
statute's
clause
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
this
court
held
keogh
had
no
right
to
proceed
for
treble
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws.
that's
somewhat
the
irony
of
this
whole
situation
that
brings
us
here
today.
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
on
the
exemption?
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
there
has
been
no
change.
in
1961,
there
was
this
proposed
change
--
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
but
that
was
deleted.
so
that
we
stand
in
the
same
position.
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
1916,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
yes,
indeed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
alexander
report
came
out
in
1914,
which
was
the
same
year
that
the
clayton
act
was
passed.
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
yes,
indeed.
i
submit
that
this
was
an
appropriate
time
to
settle
this
point
that
far
east
and
u.s.
nav
are
good
doctrine
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
a
regulatory
statute
that
you
have
in
the
shipping
act
where
you
have
this
complete
occupation
of
the
field
by
the
shipping
regulatory
law.
we
should
not
have
to
come
back
every
few
years
and
consider
whether
some
new
little
corner
should
be
carved
out
of
that,
chip-away
--
chip-away
at
it.
i
note
that,
at
some
point,
the
solicitor
general
has
seemed
to
conceive
that
far
east
and
u.s.
nav
are
good
law
but
they
ought
to
have
this
treble
damage
right.
well,
they
don't
ordinarily
come
in
just
to
help
a
private
suitor
get
damages.
and,
from
the
argument
that
was
made
here
this
morning
on
behalf
of
the
solicitor
general,
i
submit
they're
really
trying
to
get
the
whole
camel
under
the
tent
and
get
rid
of
far
east
and
get
back
on
our
back.
and
--
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
yes.
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
in
other
words,
would
retroactive
effect
wipe
out
the
unlawful
as
of
the
date
when
carnation
--
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
i
must
concede
the
same
on
the
basis
of
the
river
plate
&
brazil
against
prestil
carr
case
and
--
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
no
question
that
it
can
approve
in
both
cases.
the
approval
has
prospective
but
not
retrospective
effect.
mr.
elkan
turk,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
my
time
has
elapsed.
thank
you.
