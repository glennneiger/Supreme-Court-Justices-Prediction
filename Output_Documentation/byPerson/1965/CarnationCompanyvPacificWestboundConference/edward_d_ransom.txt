mr.
edward
d.
ransom
if
the
court
please.
solicitor
general's
office
now
conceives
of
treble
damages,
under
the
antitrust
act,
as
an
additional
remedy
and
additional
means
of
enforcement
of
the
shipping
act
inducing
carriers
to
file
their
agreements.
their
nominal
client
incidentally,
the
federal
maritime
commission,
takes
no
position
on
that
matter
and,
in
fact,
argued
to
the
contrary
below.
but
what
the
solicitor
general's
office
is
here
attempting
to
have
this
court
do
in
adding
antitrust
remedies
to
the
shipping
act,
contrary
to
the
decision
in
cunard,
congress
considered
in
1961
and
congress
rejected
this.
the
shipping
act
was
given
a
real
thorough
going
over
in
1961
by
at
least
two
houses
of
congress.
in
the
hearings
before
the
house
marine
committee,
the
department
of
justice
appeared
and
they
urged
there
an
amendment
to
the
penalty
section
of
--
section
15.
the
amendment
which
they
urged
was
one
which
would
add
to
section
15,
the
$1,000
per
day
sections
--
provisions
of
section
15,
“the
penalties
provided
by
the
antitrust
laws”.
now,
this
was
silently
attacked
by
the
chairman
of
the
then
federal
maritime
commission,
the
federal
maritime
board
on
the
basis
that
under
this
court's
doctrine
of
supersession
as
expressed
in
cunard
and
others,
the
remedies
and
penalties
of
the
shipping
act
were
the
exclusive
remedies
and
penalties
and
that
the
antitrust
penalties
and
remedies
did
not
apply.
and,
he
further
expressed
the
conviction,
and
i
use
his
words
that
if
you
introduce
these
antitrust
into
the
shipping
act,
you
will
create
irreconcilable
inconsistencies.
the
amendment
which
would
have
added
in
1961,
the
very
thing
that
is
now
being
asked
of
this
court
to
add,
that
is
the
antitrust
penalties,
died
in
committee
by
contrast
in
1961.
congress,
rather
than
believing
additional
remedies
and
penalties
were
needed,
decided
that
the
rigid
$1,000
per
day
was
too
--
was
too
rigid,
was
too
severe
for
the
areas
of
culpability
that
might
exist
in
violating
section
15
and
they
changed
that
language
to
make
it
a
discretionary
not
more
than
$1,000
per
day.
thus,
congress
in
1961
made
it
quite
clear
that
they
feel
that
additional
weapons,
additional
--
the
antitrust
additional
penalties
are
not
necessary
in
enforcing
the
shipping
act.
in
rejecting
this
amendment,
they
in
effect
ratified
the
doctrine
of
cunard
and
we
say
far
east
in
saying
that
the
shipping
act
penalties
that
they
provided
are
the
exclusive
remedies
and
penalties.
the
shipping
act
is
exclusively
that
which
operates
so
far
as
a
violation
of
section
15
is
concerned.
now
again
in
1964,
congress
had
the
opportunity
to
take
up
this
question
of
how
severe
is
the
penalties
under
section
15.
and
as
a
result
of
a
commission
decision
in
what's
known
as
the
baton
rouge
case,
for
the
first
time,
the
commission
laid
down
a
rule
to
the
effect
that
internal
lease
agreements,
which
contain
certain
restrictions
of
the
lessee,
must
bore
within
section
15
and
must
be
filed
and
approved.
these
were
common
throughout
the
country.
a
number
of
suits
asking
for
high
penalties
under
section
15
were
filed
by
the
department
of
justice.
and,
the
department
of
justice
as
well
as
the
federal
maritime
commission
and
the
industry
all
went
to
congress
for
relief
and
congress
gave
them
that
relief.
no,
certainly,
no
additional
penalties
were
needed
under
section
15.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
that
congress
would
be
quite
astounded
if
they
were
to
find,
as
is
being
urged
here,
that
those
that
they
relieved
under
the
shipping
act
were
still
at
large
under
the
antitrust
acts
and
this
terminal
amnesty
relief
act.
now,
the
ship
--
the
solicitor
general's
office
further
argues
that
there's
no
possibility
of
a
clash
of
agency
and
court.
whereas,
in
this
situation
as
is
now
before
you,
not
as
it
was
when
the
district
court
dismissed
the
action,
but
as
it
now
appears
before
you,
the
agency
has
made
the
determination
that
the
agreements
had
--
did
not
follow.
they
were
beyond
the
scope
of
the
agreement
which
was
approved,
but
this
statement
that
there's
now
no
clashing
of
court
and
agency
overlooks
the
basic
element
of
discrimination
which
exists
insofar
as
the
awarding
of
treble
damages
are
concerned.
an
underlying
objective
in
the
shipping
act,
and
it
appears
in
section
14,
section
15,
section
16
and
17,
the
operating
sections,
is
to
have
equal
treatment
by
the
carriers
of
their
--
of
their
customers.
and,
without
any
preference,
without
any
discrimination,
without
any
prejudice,
if
the
parties
were
given
a
choice
of
treble
damages
or
given
the
double
treble
damage
remedy,
there
would
be
all
types
of
possibilities
of
discrimination.
the
--
those
that
receive
treble
damages,
as
far
as
the
two-thirds
part
which
is
the
punitive
part,
would
be
getting
an
advantage
over
those
who
sought
reparations.
they
would
also
be
getting
advantage
over
those
who,
like
in
this
case,
paid
the
rate
that
was
on
file
which,
but
for
this
agreement
which
five
years
later
has
been
determined
not
to
be
filed
or
approved,
was
unfiled
and
was
at
that
time
the
rate
which
everybody
was
paying.
if
carnation
were
to
get
treble
damages,
they
would
have
a
two-thirds
advantage
over
those
who
paid
the
rate.
and,
even
if
everybody
sued
and
they
got
treble
damages,
as
the
court
has
pointed
out
on
frequent
occasions,
the
juries
and
the
courts
are
not
going
to
award
the
same
amount.
now,
carnation,
in
its
subsequent
--
its
reply
brief
says,
“well,
that
doesn't
apply
here
because
it's
a
matter
--
those
cases
were
a
matter
of
reasonableness
of
the
rate,”
and
we're
not
concerned
here
with
the
reasonableness
of
the
rate.
we're
just
talking
about
$2.50
and
that's
it.
but
that
in
itself
overlooks,
i
think,
an
important
allegation
in
carnation's
complaint
and
that
is
that
carnation
choose
to
absorb
the
$2.50
and
to
come
into
court,
as
they
are
coming
into
court
now
and
seek
treble
damages.
some
might
have
chose
to
pass
on
this
amount
in
part,
some
in
whole
so
that
you
would
in
any
event
have,
if
it
went
to
the
courts
and
the
juries,
you'd
--
you
would
undoubtedly
have
a
situation
of
discrimination
or
differences,
non-uniform
treatment.
now,
the
only
way
you
can
avoid
that
non-uniform
treatment
--
the
uniform
--
the
only
way
you
can
avoid
lack
of
uniformity
and
to
obtain
uniformity
is
to
do
exactly
what
the
shipping
act
said
you
should
do
or
what
they
provided,
and
that
is
under
section
22,
the
one
agency
determines
all
of
these
matters
of
claims
and
the
one
agency
also
then
can
award
not
treble
damages,
but
just
make
the
party
whole
and
give
him
reparations.
the
shipping
act
also,
by
the
very
fact
that
it
makes
the
fine
payable
not
to
enrich
the
shipper
but
makes
the
fine
it
has,
the
$1,000
a
day,
payable
to
the
government,
carries
out
this
plan
of
uniformity.
now,
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
yes?
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
i
think
that
they
--
it
would
depend
on
the
ocean
documents
and
bills
of
lading
as
to
whether
or
not
--
they
would
or
not
--
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
yes,
yes
it
is.
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
i
don't
--
i
honestly
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
whether
they
would
or
not,
i
think
it
might
well
depend
upon
the
ocean
shipping
document.
i
do
want
to
emphasize,
however,
that
this
--
the
whole
theory
of
uniformity
does
go
out
the
window
as
soon
as
you
let
this
element
of
treble
damages
come
in,
and
this
--
that's
the
feature
that
this
court,
in
the
original
abilene
case,
the
original
primary
jurisdiction
talked
about
in
keogh,
in
the
terminal
warehouse
case
in
1936,
and
in
georgia
against
the
pennsylvania
railroad
insofar
as
the
damage
feature
of
that
case
is
concerned.
now,
the
situation
which
the
solicitor
general
suggests
also
places
the
industry
in
a
very
difficult
position,
an
untenable
position
in
this
regard.
one
of
the
most
difficult
features,
one
of
the
most
difficult
problems
that
this
commission
has
had
to
wrestle
with
from
the
inception
of
section
15
is,
‘when
is
an
agreement
which
you
file
--
and
then
you
act
under
that
agreement
and
you
have
procedures,
some
of
which
are
in
your
term,
when
are
those
subsequent
procedures
something
beyond
that
which
you
obtained
approval
for.
this
case
presents
a
classic
example
of
that.
these
so-called
supplemental
agreements
and
the
matter
of
the
--
of
the
concurrence
is
a
situation
where
the
commission
took
several
years
to
finally
determine.
in
the
mean
time,
the
circuit
court,
the
ninth
circuit
took
a
different
view
as
to
whether
or
not
concurrence
was
allowable.
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
they
agreed,
more
or
less,
with
the
circuit
court
that
there
was
some
area
for
making
joint
rates
within
the
approved
agreement
8200.
and,
now,
the
commission
has
come
out
with
a
clarification
saying
that
they
didn't
really
mean
there
was
any
area
for
this.
and
the
commission
in
this
case
did
exactly
the
problem
that
can
punch
the
industry.
they
said,
“we
are
announcing
a
new
test
as
to
when
agreements
may
be
considered
as
having
gone
beyond
that
--
the
scope
of
that
which
you've
already
filed
and
as
to
when
the
approval
you've
already
obtained
gives
you
the
blanket
of
approval.”
whenever
the
commission
announces
--
the
test
they
announced
incidentally
was
in
effect,
has
been
interpreted
by
in
some
sources
as
indicating
that
if
you
have
a
tariff
provision
that
differs
from
you
basic
section
15
agreement,
if
you've
got
a
tariff
rule,
then
that
tariff
rule
itself
goes
beyond
the
scope
and
you
have
to
have
a
separate
section
15
agreement.
now,
this
puts
the
industry
in
the
situation,
as
this
one,
where
the
solicitor
general
who
says,
“we
will
acknowledge
cunard
and
far
east
as
the
doctrine
supersession
and
then
that
you
should
refer
to
the
commission
for
those
determinations.
but
once
those
determinations
are
made,
then
immediately
you're
subject
--
you're
at
large
under
the
antitrust
acts.”
it
puts
the
industry
in
the
position
of
having
--
now
faced
with
the
new
rule
and
having
themselves
subjected,
in
effect,
to
a
double
penalty
statute.
and
--
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
the
--
i
--
what
i
would
claim
would
be
that
the
conference,
under
the
present
decision
of
the
commission,
did
violate
section
15
at
the
time
that
they
made
this
rate
because
they
--
the
commission
has
now
determined
that
they
went
beyond
the
scope
of
their
filed
agreement.
however,
this
rate
you
see
is
no
longer
a
problem.
back
several
years
ago,
they
changed
the
rate
back.
but,
the
procedures
by
which
they
adopted
this
rate,
i
say
it's
now
the
commission
has
said
to
them
“alright,
you
didn't
get
approval,
bring
your
agreements
in
and
we'll
consider
them,
make
up
--
make
up
what
it
was
you
were
acting
under
and
bring
them
in”
and,
this
is
--
and,
so
that,
the
commission
doesn't
say
so,
but
it
certainly
hints
that
what
they
did
was
not
unapprovable.
it's
simply
that
they
hadn't
been
gotten
approved.
is
that
--
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
no,
there
is
--
so
far
as
any
cases
are
concerned,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
retroactive
approval.
what
the
commission
can
do
is
go
forward
with
--
in
the
future,
they
can
say
yes
in
the
future,
you
may
do
this
but
they
cannot
give
approval
to
the
retroactive
--
retroactively.
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
no,
no,
no,
the
recent
action
of
the
commission
would
not
inure
to
our
benefit
at
this
time.
we've
not
--
we're
not
claiming
that,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
i
think
the
issue
is
--
the
basic
issue
in
the
case
as
introduced
by
mr.
dunne,
enlarged
by
the
solicitor
general's
office,
but
i
think
the
basic
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
decision
of
this
court
in
1932,
in
the
cunard
case,
is
correct
or
incorrect.
and
that
case
incidentally,
of
course
was
followed
in
the
far
east
case
in
1952
because
there
they
did
dismiss
it.
that
case
adopted
the
principle
of
--
that
since
the
shipping
act
has
set
up
its
set
of
penalties
and
remedies
an
since
the
shipping
act
has
acted
upon
and
take
over
--
taken
over
and
completely
encompassed
this
matter
of
filing
anticompetitive
agreements,
the
matter
of
filing
them
or,
if
unfiled,
penalizing
the
parties
for
them,
that
it's
the
shipping
act
and
not
the
antitrust
act
which
takes
over.
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
i
would
answer
categorically,
yes.
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
yes,
i
think
it
is.
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
yes.
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
well,
if
--
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
if
congress
had
--
had
in
1961
expressly
added
the
--
that
which
was
asked
for
them
to
do,
then
i
think--
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
that
still
is
in
there,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
yes.
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
oh,
why
was
it
ever
necessary
to
put
it
in
the
first
place?
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
yes,
yes
my
position
would
be
the
same.
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
i
think
that
a
reason,
if
you
can
impute
to
congress
the
sophistication,
which
we
like
to
impute
to
congress
after
the
act,
i
think
that
the
reason
that
they
needed
the
express
immunity
at
that
time
for
approved
agreements
was
because
they
were
making
approved
agreements
lawful.
therefore,
having
made
approved
agreements
lawful,
they
would
still
be
unlawful
approved
agreements
under
the
antitrust
acts
if
they
did
not
go
for
--
further
and
say,
“but,
we
make
them
lawful
here
but
--“
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
well,
may
i
finish?
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
they
would
need
to
say
that,
if
my
argument
is
correct
insofar
as
approved
agreements.
my
argument
is
that
for
unapproved
agreements,
and
this
is
the
cunard
case
that
for
unapproved
agreements,
they
made
those
unlawful.
now,
having
made
those
unlawful,
they
at
the
same
time,
provided
penalties
and
remedies.
there
is
no
penalties
and
remedies
provided
for
approved
agreements.
it's
the
provision
of
penalties
and
remedies
under
the
shipping
act,
which
takes
it
out
of
the
orbit
of
the
antitrust
penalties
and
remedies.
so
that,
approved
agreements
do
--
do
need
some
protection
from
the
antitrust
acts.
unapproved
agreements,
having
provided
the
penalties
and
remedies
and,
as
the
cunard
case
says,
the
doctrine
that
the
agency's
penalties
and
remedies
apply,
if
they
provide
them,
that
doctrine
was
already
well-known
in
1916.
mr.
edward
d.
ransom
yes.
i
say
that
approved
agreements
needed
more
protection
than
unapproved
agreements
because
approved
agreements
didn't
have
any
--
any
violation
that
we
were
talking
about
to
take
over,
whereas,
the
unapproved
agreements
did
have
penalties
and
remedies
that
were
substituted.
i
--
on
this
point,
while
we're
on
that
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
--
i
would
say
also
that
the
distinction
which
both
mr.
dunne
from
carnation
and
the
solicitor
general
make
between
our
case
and
the
cunard
and
far
east
case,
that
is
the
distinction
which
they
make
that
those
cases
dealt
with
injunctions
and
ours
deal
with
treble
damages
and
they
seem,
in
fact
they've
expressed
in
their
brief,
quite
willing
to
concede
that
supersession
takes
over
so
far
as
injunctions
are
concerned,
but
no
--
not
with
treble
damages.
if
that's
the
case,
then
they
have
destroyed
the
argument
that
you
can
only
get
immunity
because
--
for
approved
agreements
because
approved
agreements
are
expressly
exempt.
now
to
restate
that,
injunctions
and
treble
damage
actions,
both
unapproved,
should
be
treated
the
same
as
--
so
far
as
whether
it's
an
express
exemption
or
not
an
express
exemption
and
if
you
attempt
to
make
cunard
and
far
east
cases
be
distinguished
because
they
deal
with
another
kind
of
remedy,
you
simply
must
agree
or
they
must
agree
that
you
do
not
only
get
your
immunity
from
express
exemptions.
you
get
your
immunity
because
the
shipping
act
is
--
provides
these
penalties
and
remedies,
and
the
shipping
act
is
unique
among
all
statutes
that
this
court
has
dealt
with
on
this
general
subject.
the
shipping
act
alone
is
the
only
act
that
provides
penalties
and
remedies.
it's
the
only
act
that
requires
that
you
take
these
anticompetitive
agreements
and
file
them.
it's
the
only
act
which
provides
both
injunction
and
damages.
it's
the
only
act
which
provides
the
--
a
penalty
for
failure
to
bring
them
in
and
file
them.
it
contains
no
savings
clause
for
saving
to
--
as
the
cab
and
the
icc
does,
and
it
does
have
a
right
of
judicial
review.
so
that,
of
all
the
acts,
which
this
court
has
dealt
with
on
this
subject,
the
shipping
act
is
unique.
thank
you.
