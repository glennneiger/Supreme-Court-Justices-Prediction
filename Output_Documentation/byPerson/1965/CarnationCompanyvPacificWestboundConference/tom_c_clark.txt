what
violations
did
they
find?
justice

yes.
justice

that's
the
only
one
they
found?
justice
tom
c.

just
the
commission.
justice

c.
clark
yes,
discrimination
between
the
shippers?
justice
tom
c.
clark
of
course,
that's
the
whole
gravamen
of
your
case,
isn't
it,
the
fact
that
they
did
not
approve
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
didn't
file
it,
therefore,
it
was
not
legal
is
your
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
therefore,
no
immunity?
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
i
meant
was
you'd
have
a
different
case
if
they
had
filed
it,
perhaps
if
they
had
filed
this?
