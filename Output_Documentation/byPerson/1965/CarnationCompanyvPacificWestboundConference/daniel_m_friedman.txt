mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
government
sees
this
case,
it
involves
basically
two
issues.
the
first
issue
which
i'll
just
refer
to
very
briefly
is
this.
where
an
antitrust
suit
for
treble
damages
alleges
that
members
of
a
conference
have
acted
pursuant
to
a
rate-fixing
agreement
that
has
not
been
approved
by
the
federal
maritime
commission,
are
there
any
issues
raised
in
that
case
which
call
for
the
exercise
of
the
commission's
primary
jurisdiction?
the
second
issue,
which
i
think
is
the
major
issue
in
the
case,
is
whether
the
shipping
act
so
has
such
a
pervasive
regulatory
scheme
that
the
provision
for
reparations
in
that
act
may
fairly
be
said
to
exclude
the
possibility
of
any
relief
under
the
sherman
act
for
conduct
which
violates
the
shipping
act.
now,
as
to
the
first
issue,
we
part
company
somewhat
with
the
petitioner
on
this.
we
think
where
an
allegation
is
made
that
people
are
acting,
but
not
under
an
agreement
that
has
been
approved,
and
if
there
is
a
question
whether
what
they
have
done
is
authorized
by
an
agreement,
that
is
properly
a
matter
in
the
first
instance
to
be
considered
by
the
maritime
commission.
that,
we
think,
is
the
teaching
of
the
far
east
and
the
cunard
cases
and
that
situation,
seems
to
us,
should
be
the
result
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
gives
the
court
the
benefit
of
the
expert
judgment
of
the
maritime
commission
and,
secondly,
it
avoids,
what
this
court
was
concerned
about
in
both
cunard
and
far
east,
the
possibility
of
a
conflict,
of
a
clash,
of
the
court
saying
something
is
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
when,
as
a
result
by
a
ruling
by
the
maritime
commission,
it
turns
out
that
it
is
exempt
under
the
antitrust
law,
but
we
think
that
issue
is
out
of
this
case
now
because,
in
the
administrative
proceeding
that
the
maritime
commission
has
conducted,
only
last
friday,
the
commission
issued
an
opinion
on
re-hearing
which
made
it
crystal
clear,
unequivocally,
the
commission
said
that
this
agreement
no.
8200,
the
agreement
between
the
two
conferences,
does
not
authorize
any
joint
rate-fixing.
so,
to
whatever
extent
the
argument
might
be
made,
that
what
these
people
have
done
is
sanctioned
by
an
agreement
approved
by
the
maritime
commission,
that
argument
is
no
longer
open
to
them.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
commission
--
its
interpretation
of
the
agreement
which
it
previously
had
filed
and
had
approved.
in
other
words,
the
agreement
no.
8200
between
the
two
conferences,
that
agreement
had
been
filed
with
the
commission
and
had
been
approved
by
the
commission,
and
then
the
commission
interpreted
its
agreement
that
it
had
approved
and
said,
“no,
this
agreement
does
not
authorize
what
it
has
claimed
these
people
are
doing.”
so,
the
commission
has
taken
out
of
the
case,
we
think,
any
claim
that
what
the
conferences
are
doing
is
authorized
under
an
approved
decree
and
then
the
question,
it
seems
to
us,
comes
down
as
to
whether,
despite
that
fact,
the
shipping
act
somehow
creates
an
immunity
from
the
antitrust
laws.
whether,
by
implication,
the
statutory
scheme
of
the
shipping
act
is
such,
that
congress
can
fairly
have
said
that
--
even
though
you
have
not
gotten
the
approval
of
a
federal
maritime
commission,
nevertheless,
you
have
immunity
from
the
antitrust
laws.
we
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is,
no,
the
statute
does
not
give
that
immunity.
we
think
this
results
from
the
language
of
the
statute,
from
its
design
and
policy
and
legislative
history
and,
finally,
as
mr.
dunne
has
indicated,
from
the
holding
in
the
far
east
case
itself.
i
like
to
start
as
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
if
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
--
if
the
question
was
just
whether
it
had
been
filed,
i
assume
there
would
be
probably
no
need
to
have
resort
to
the
maritime
commission
for
that,
but
if
it
has
been
filed
and
approved
and
there
is
a
question
whether
what
they
have
done
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
but
there
had
been
a
--
they
allege
that
they
were
supplementary
agreements,
supplementary
in
agreements
over
and
beyond
the
main
agreement
that
had
been
approved.
this
is
what
they
alleged.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
commission,
mr.
justice
--
this
section,
by
the
way,
under
18
was
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
let
me
say
about
it
two
things.
first,
it
was
only
in
1961
that
the
commission
gained
the
authority
to
disapprove
these
rates
in
foreign
commerce.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
1965
--
these
rates
have
been
altered
in
1962.
they
reduced
the
rates,
but
even
though
--
the
commission
could
disapprove
these
rates
prospectively,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
that
makes
any
difference
insofar
as
their
right
to
relief
for
the
past
period
when
the
rates
were
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
is,
mr.
justice.
i'd
like
now
to
turn
to
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
which
seems
to
us,
should
be
the
starting
point
for
this
argument
and
at
page
3
of
our
brief,
we
have
set
forth
section
15
and
section
15
basically
has
three
components.
the
first
part
of
it,
at
the
top
of
page
3,
requires
all
common
carriers
by
water
to
file
with
the
commission
every
agreement
fixing
or
regulating
transportation
rates
or
fares,
as
well
as
a
host
of
other
agreements.
basically,
all
agreements
restricting
competition
have
to
be
filed
with
the
commission.
then,
down
to
the
middle
of
the
page,
it
states
that
all
agreements
shall
be
lawful
only
when
and
as
long
as
approved
by
the
commission.
now,
the
agreement
of
fixing
rates
is
not
lawful
until
it's
approved
by
the
commission,
and
then
it
goes
on
and
says,
“before
approval
or
after
disapproval,
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
carry
out
in
whole
or
in
part,
directly
or
directly,
any
such
agreement”
and
then,
finally,
at
the
very
end
of
the
section,
it
says,
“every
agreement,
modification,
or
cancellation
lawful
under
this
section,
and
by
definition
lawful
under
this
section
means
an
agreement
that
has
been
approved
by
the
commission,
any
agreement
lawful
under
this
section
shall
be
exempted
from
the
antitrust
laws,”
but
it
seems
to
us,
that
this
language
means
what
it
says
that
the
only
exemption
is
for
agreements
that
are
lawful
under
this
section,
that
is,
agreements
that
have
been
filed
with
and
approved
by
the
commission
and
that
this
section
does
not
somehow,
in
addition
to
that,
give
an
antitrust
immunity
to
agreements
that
have
not
been
filed
and
approved
with
the
commission.
if
that's
what
congress
intended,
it
certainly
used
very
odd
language
to
say
it.
it
would
have
said
all
agreements
covered
by
this
section,
all
agreements
whether
or
not
approved
shall
be
lawful.
it
didn't
say
that.
it
said
every
agreement
lawful
under
this
section.
now,
it
would
seem
to
us
to
take
a
very
strong
showing
on
the
part
of
either
the
legislative
history
of
the
scheme
of
the
act
to
impute
the
congress
from
this
language
an
intention
to
confer
antitrust
immunity
upon
agreements
that
are
not
lawful
under
this
section.
when
we
look
to
the
history
and
design
of
the
statute,
we
think
it
makes
it
quite
clear
that
that's
not
what
congress
intended
because
as
mr.
dunne
has
indicated,
in
1916,
congress
made
the
determination
that
the
antitrust
laws
would
not
apply
with
full
vigor
to
the
shipping
industry.
they
recognized
that
the
norms
of
competition
that
our
antitrust
laws
provide
may
not
properly
be
applicable
there.
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
--
yes,
mr.
justice,
they
did
provide
us
--
they
provided
penalties
for
operating
under
an
agreement
that
had
not
been
approved
by
the
commission.
and
we
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
congress
was
so
concerned
about
the
evils
that
might
flow
from
the
conferences
acting
pursuant
to
unapproved
agreements
that
they
in
effect,
provided
a
double
penalty
to
encourage
people
to
file
agreements.
they
imposed
penalties
under
the
shipping
act
and
they
also
said,
“you
may
get
an
antitrust
immunity
only
if
you
file
with
the
commission.”
in
other
words
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don't
suggest
that,
mr.
justice,
because
in
this
case,
carnation
has
not
sought
reparations
so
there's
no
way
the
commission
cannot
award
it.
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
we
think
this
is
a
–
it
is
a
difficult
question.
it
may
well
be
that,
if
they
seek
reparations,
this
might
be
viewed
as
an
election.
we
think
that's
not
faced
in
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
carnation
has
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
might
be
situations,
mr.
justice,
where
they
might
feel
perhaps
problems
of
proof,
they
think,
might
be
more
difficult.
but
of
course
the
reparations,
the
reparations
remedy
is
not
just
limited
to
conduct
that
violates
the
antitrust
laws.
there
are
many
things
which
may
violate
the
shipping
act
which
reparations
would
be
appropriate
for
which
an
antitrust
suit
would
not
lie.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
permitting
the
additional
remedy
of
an
antitrust
suit
after
the
maritime
commission
has
exercised
any
primary
jurisdiction
it
may
have,
permitting
that
remedy
presents
no
possible
clash
between
any
order
of
the
maritime
commission,
on
the
one
hand,
and
any
decree
of
the
court,
on
the
other.
there
isn't
the
problem
that
the
court
was
faced
with
in
the
far
east
and
cunard
situation
where
what
we
had
was
an
attempt
to
seek
injunctive
relief
where
the
court
was
being
asked
to
enjoin
something
that
the
maritime
commission
subsequently
might
approve.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there's
no
legislative
history,
mr.
justice,
that
bears
directly
on
this
problem,
but
i
would
like
to
refer
to
one
bit
of
legislative
history,
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
but
we
haven't
quoted
from,
and
that
is
the
committee
report
on
the
1961
amendments
to
the
shipping
act.
in
1961,
congress
made
a
number
of
rather
extensive
amendments
in
the
shipping
act
and,
in
the
course
of
that,
the
respondents
rely
on
certain
statements
made
by
the
chairman
of
the
maritime
commission
which
they
say
indicates
congress
didn't
intend
the
antitrust
remedy.
but,
i'd
like
to
read
to
the
court
two
sentences
from
the
committee
report
--
the
house
committee
report
on
that
1961
legislative
his
--
legislation
which
is
set
forth
at
footnote
13
of
page
25
of
our
brief.
and,
i
might
say
mr.
justice,
i
have
some
doubt
whether
the
legislative
history
of
what
congress
intended
in
1961
cast
too
much
light
on
what
congress
intended
in
1916.
but,
to
whatever
extent
it's
relevant,
this
is
what
the
house
committee
said,
“in
order
to
secure
the
benefits
of
such
immunity
from
the
antitrust
acts,
the
conferences
are
required
by
section
15
of
the
shipping
act
of
1916
to
file
all
their
agreements
with
the
appropriate
regulatory
party,
which
at
present
is
the
federal
maritime
board,
and
obtain
approval
of
that
body.”
in
other
words
it
said
to
obtain
the
benefits
of
such
immunity,
they're
required
to
obtain
the
approval
of
the
body
for
an
agreement
that
it
is
filed
with
and
then
it
went
on
and
said,
“the
board
has
considerable
jurisdiction
under
the
terms
of
that
act
to
regulate
the
conferences
and
see
that
they
observe
the
restrictions
upon
which
their
immunity
from
the
operation
of
the
antitrust
acts
is
predicated.”
the
restrictions
upon
which
that
immunity
from
the
antitrust
laws
is
predicated,
we
think
is
what
this
statute
says.
they
have
to
file
and
obtain
the
approval
of
the
commission.
now,
finally,
i'd
just
like
to
refer
very
briefly
to
the
far
east
case
and
show
why
we
think
that
supports
our
position.
in
the
far
east
case,
as
has
been
indicated,
the
question
was
whether
the
government
might
maintain
an
injunctive
suit
to
enjoin
enforcement
of
a
dual
rate
system.
and
this
court
after
analyzing
the
statute,
concluded
that
the
case
was
controlled
by
the
cunard
case
and
it
didn't
make
any
difference
that
the
plaintiff
in
far
east
was
the
government
rather
than
a
private
party.
after
reaching
this
conclusion,
the
opinion
then
said,
“well,
what
do
we
do
with
the
case?”
the
district
court
had
refused
to
dismiss
it,
and
the
question
was
put
“do
we
dismiss
the
case
or
do
we
hold
it
on
the
docket”
and
the
court
decided
in
the
circumstances,
dismissal
was
appropriate.
well,
if
the
respondents
are
correct
that
somehow
the
shipping
act
completely
immunizes
them
from
antitrust
activity,
it
seems
clear
to
us
there
was
no
need
to
make
that
choice.
if
they're
correct,
there
was
nothing
to
be
held
on
the
docket
in
the
far
east
case,
the
case
should
have
been
dismissed.
there
was
nothing
to
hold
on
the
docket
and
then,
and
then
the
court
went
on
in
explaining
why
it
should
be
dismissed.
it
added,
“a
similar
suit
is
easily
initiated
later
if
appropriate”.
in
other
words,
all
that
far
east
said
was
that
that
was
the
kind
of
a
question
which
in
the
first
instance,
should
be
submitted
to
the
commission,
and
let
the
commission
decide
it.
they
think
the
commission
probably
can
give
adequate
relief,
but
if
not,
a
similar
suit
can
then
be
initiated
by
the
government.
here,
a
similar
suit
probably
could
not
be
initiated
by
the
petitioner
if
this
sort
of
dismissal
stands
because
it
would
appear
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
already
right.
thank
you.
