j.
brennan,

well,
is
it
--
to
narrow
this,
mr.
dunne,
not
having
the
supplemental
agreements
proved
the
condition
upon
which
the
exemption
comes
into
play
was
not
met
and
therefore,
you're
free
if
you
can
make
out
an
antitrust
law
case,
bring
an
antitrust
action.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
see
now.
they're
two
different
things,
i
think.
you
say
you
have
an
antitrust
action
because
they
didn't
--
it
was
not
filed
and
approved.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
doesn't
prove
that
you
got
an
antitrust
claim.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
suggest
that
carnation
might
have
both
treble
damages
and
reparations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
do
not
suggest
they
could
have
both?
