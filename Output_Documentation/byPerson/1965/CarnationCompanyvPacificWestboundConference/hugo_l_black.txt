justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
this
simple.
the
antitrust
act
has
been
violated.
the
question
is
whether
immunity
is
granted
by
this
act.
you
say
it's
not
because
they
didn't
approve
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
reason
for
the
holding
in
what
you
say,
the
commission
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
the
court
determine
whether
the
approval
has
been
had
or
--
suppose
it
has
been
filed,
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
suppose
it
has
just
been
filed,
not
even
filed
with
the
commission
but
it's
an
agreement
to
fix
rates
and
that's
alleged
in
the
complaint.
why
isn't
that
enough?
why
would
there
be
anything
left
for
the
commission
to
determine?
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
whether
it's
been
filed,
then
that
would
be
a
pretty
easy
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
i
understand
that,
but
i
understand
that
they
just
didn't
get
that
far.
they
just
alleged
that
it
hadn't
been
filed,
and
it
hadn't
been
approved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
were
so
meticulous
in
that
regard,
why
didn't
they
add
“if
you
did
not
file,
then
your
remedy
was
under
the
act”.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
we
still
have
the
same
language
as
was
put
in
recently
on
this
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
in
1916.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
along
about
the
time
they
were
pretty
active
over
there
in
connection
with
enforcing
the
antitrust
laws,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
was
in
two
years
of
the
passage
of
the
clayton
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
strengthen
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
an
injunction
would
undoubtedly
have
interfered
with
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
commission,
wouldn't
it?
