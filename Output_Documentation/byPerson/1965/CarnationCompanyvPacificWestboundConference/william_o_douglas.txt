justice
william
o.
douglas
may
i
interrupt
at
this
point?
in
other
words,
these
--
these
rates
that
you're
talking
about
are
not
rates
that
the
commission
could
find
to
be
so
unreasonably
high
or
low
as
to
be
detrimental
to
the
commerce
of
the
united
states?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
because
they
weren't
--
they
were
never
on
file?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
that's
what
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
agreement
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
understand.
justice
william
o.
douglas
were
the
rates
â€“
the
rates
under
the
agreements
filed,
do
you
know?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
my
difficulty
is
that
even
though
an
agreement
hasn't
been
filed,
apparently
the
rates
under
those
agreements
were
filed
and,
under
section
18,
the
commission
would
have
power
to
disapprove
them.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
not
the
agreement
per
se
that
we're
interested
in.
it's
the
rates
that
are
the
product
of
the
agreement.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
this
is
1965
though.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that
may
be
the
answer.
i
don't
