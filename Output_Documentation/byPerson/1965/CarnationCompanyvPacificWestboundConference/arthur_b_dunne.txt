from
west
coast
ports
to
manila.
it
commenced
an
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california,
asserting
that
rates
charged
to
it
had
been
arrived
at
by
an
agreement
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act
and
it
was
suing
for
treble
damages
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
the
defendants
in
the
action
were
the
regular
berth
carriers
from
the
pacific
coast,
from
the
gulf
ports,
and
from
the
atlantic
coast
ports
and
an
association,
pacific
westbound
conference
made
up
of
those
carriers
operating
from
the
pacific
coast
ports
and
the
far
east
conference
made
up
of
carriers
operating
from
the
gulf
and
atlantic
coast
ports.
immediately
upon
the
beginning
of
the
action,
the
carrier-defendants
and
the
two
conferences
who
were
made
--
been
made
defendants,
plus,
the
chairman
of
the
westbound
conference
appeared
and
moved
to
dismiss
the
action
upon
the
ground
that
shipping
act
1916
had,
for
the
purposes
of
the
action
superseded
the
clayton
act
and
the
sherman
act
and
that
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction.
the
federal
maritime
commission,
the
agency
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
shipping
act
moved
and
was
granted
leave
to
intervene,
filed
an
answer
which
did
not
deny
any
of
the
averments
of
the
complaint,
but
also
moved
to
dismiss
upon
the
ground
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
the
district
court
sustained
the
motions
and
dismissed
the
action.
carnation
company
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
that
court
affirmed,
denied
a
petition
for
a
re-hearing.
carnation
petitioned
this
court
to
review
that
decision
on
certiorari.
that
petition
was
granted,
and
the
case
is
now
here
for
decision.
now
more
particularly
as
to
the
facts
and
the
parties;
the
westbound
surface
carriers
from
the
pacific
coast
had
formed
an
association,
pacific
westbound
conference
under
conference
agreement
57,
i
believe
is
the
number,
filed
with
the
then
administrating
agency
of
the
shipping
act
and
approved
by
it.
for
our
purposes,
the
principal
term
of
that
conference
agreement
is
that
the
conference
was
made
the
rate-fixing
agency
for
the
carriers
operating
from
the
pacific
coast.
also
sometime
before
the
1950s,
the
carriers
from
the
gulf
and
atlantic
ports,
under
a
conference
agreement
filed
with
the
then
administrative
agency
under
the
shipping
act,
had
formed
a
conference
which
was
the
rate-fixing
body
for
those
carriers
and
that
conference
agreement
had
been
approved.
in
1952,
the
members
of
both
these
conferences,
and
incidentally
these
conferences
are
conferences
of
carriers
which
are
in
competing
trades.
the
trade
from
the
gulf
and
atlantic
ports
competes
for
the
trade
to
the
far
east
and
the
pacific
ports.
the
members
of
these
two
conferences
met
and
eventually
entered
into
an
agreement
known
as
“8200,”
which
is
set
out
in
full
in
the
record.
that
agreement
was
filed
with
the
federal
maritime
board,
the
predecessor
of
the
present
commission,
and
in
december
of
1952
was
approved.
following
that
approval,
the
members,
well,
i
should
first
state
that,
primarily,
that
agreement
--
that
the
two
provisions
that
are
important
are
the
first
and
second.
they
provided
for
a
meeting
and
organization
and,
in
second,
particularly
in
second,
whatever
else
that
agreement
may
have
provided
for,
it
retained
to
each
of
the
conferences
the
right
of
independent
action
with
respect
to
the
fixing
of
rates.
in
the
early
part
of
february
of
1953,
the
members
of
these
conferences
met
at
santa
barbara
and
organized,
and
eventually,
as
a
result
of
that
meeting
and
as
a
result
of
--
they
held
annual
meetings
or
further
meetings
and
in
1956,
as
appears
in
the
opinion
of
the
federal
maritime
commission,
they
had
arrived
at
agreements
to
this
effect
with
respect
to
the
fixing
of
rates.
certain
bulk
cargo
was
exempted
from
the
arrangement.
certain
other
items
of
freight
were
placed
on
what
was
known
as
an
initiative
list
for
either
the
pacific
westbound
conference
or
the
far
east
conference,
and
that
meant
that
those
conferences,
for
their
own
members,
could
fix
the
rates
without
concurrence
of
the
other
conference
for
those
items
which
appeared
on
their
initiative
list.
it
was
also
determined
that
items
would
not
be
placed
upon
the
initiative
list
for
either
conference
without
the
concurrence
of
the
other.
it
resulted
that
from
1956-on,
an
item
could
not
be
put
on
the
initiative
list
without
concurrence
of
both
conferences.
secondly,
the
rates
for
an
item
which
was
not
on
the
initiative
list
could
not
be
fixed
by
any
one
of
the
two
rate-making
conferences
for
its
own
members
without
the
concurrence
of
the
other
conference.
evaporated
milk
was
not
on
the
initiative
list.
in
1957,
effective
as
of
may
1,
1957,
the
then
existing
rates
of
evaporated
milk
from
pacific
coast
ports
to
the
far
east
theretofore
properly
fixed
by
pacific
westbound
conference
for
its
own
members
was
raised
by
$2.50
a
ton.
later
on
that
year,
this
petitioner
applied
to
pacific
westbound
conference
to
reduce
that
rate
by
$2.50
a
ton
and
return
it
to
the
rate
that
it
theretofore
been
fixed.
in
february
of
the
next
year,
pacific
westbound
conference
determined
for
itself
that
such
a
reduction
was
in
order
and
applied
to
far
east
conference
for
concurrence.
concurrence
was
denied.
thereupon,
pacific
westbound
conference
withdrew
its
request
and
the
increased
rate
remained
in
effect
until
1962.
at
a
later
time,
the
federal
maritime
commission
undertook
an
investigation
which
had,
for
its
purposes,
it's
on
its
own
motion,
two
matters;
one,
to
determine
whether
this
filed
agreement
8200,
under
which
the
two
conferences
were
purporting
to
act,
represented
the
full
agreement
of
the
parties
and,
secondly,
to
determine
the
order
being
in
effect
in
language
of
section
15
of
the
shipping
act,
whether
or
not
it
was
of
such
character
that
it
should
remain
approved.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
that
was
in
--
it
was
initiated
well
before
this
suit.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
well
before
this
suit,
your
honor,
and
it
was
in
the
course
of
this
suit
that
--
and
we
alleged
this
in
the
complaint,
carnation
company
learned
the
facts
which
i
have
just
recited
and
thereupon
and
before
that
proceeding
before
the
commission
had
been
determined,
brought
this
action
in
december
of
1962.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
these
facts
and
the
commission
so-found
at
least
were
unknown
to
carnation
company
and
to
the
public
generally.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
that's
correct.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
yes,
a
very
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
the
affirmance
of
the
complaint
are
that
these
were
not
known.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
no.
but,
your
honor,
i
want
to
be
cautious
now
because
you're
asking
me
something
that's
--
from
an
indistinct
recollection
as
to
the
affirmance
of
the
complaint.
i
might
make
a
mistake
about
it
as
to
just
how
far
the
complaint
went
in
stating
that
these
matters
were
unknown.
of
course,
the
only
purpose
of
stating
that
they
were
unknown
was
to
meet
a
possible
statute
of
limitations
question.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
yes,
your
honor.
the
title
plan
in
this
action,
and
this
i
think
is
a
matter
of
some
significance
in
pleading
these
facts,
planted
itself
squarely
upon
the
proposition
that
there
was
an
agreement
to
fix
rates
which
was
per
se
illegal
under
the
sherman
act.
it
did
not
plant
itself
on
any
claim
of
discrimination.
it
did
not
claim
that
the
rates
were
unreasonable.
none
of
the
ordinary
regulatory
questions,
which
ordinarily
arise
with
respect
to
rates
of
carriers,
are
presented
by
the
complaint.
now,
the
question
then
of
course
is
whether
or
not
in
these
circumstances,
whether
a
complaint
setting
a
set
of
facts,
as
to
which
it's
never
been
questioned
that
it
standing
alone
was
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
and
an
action
under
the
clayton
act
whether
that
situation
was
changed
because
of
the
provisions
of
the
shipping
act
1916,
insofar
as
they
deal
with
foreign
commerce.
i
emphasize
that,
if
your
honors
please,
because
in
the
original
shipping
act
of
1916,
there
was
a
marked
distinction
between
the
regulation
of
carriers
in
foreign
commerce
and
those
in
interstate
commerce.
section
18,
having
to
do
with
rates
applying
only
to
interstate
commerce
and
not
as
to
foreign
commerce,
and
the
shipping
act
neither
then
nor
at
any
other
time,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
its
decision
in
the
east
branson
case,
has
conferred
upon
the
agency
charged
with
the
policing
of
the
shipping
act,
the
power
to
fix
rates.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
in
foreign
commerce
only.
now,
the
distinction
that
i
have
just
made
was
made
even
more
marked
in
that
regard,
your
honor,
by
the
act
of
1938
which
applied
to
interstate
carriage
by
water,
the
terms
of
the
inter-coastal
shipping
act
of
1933
which
had
further
regulatory
provisions.
and
then,
in
1940,
with
the
adoption
of
part
3
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
congress
introduced
a
completely
new
scheme
or
regulation
with
respect
to
water
carriers
in
interstate
commerce,
made
them
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
rather
than
the
commission
administering
the
shipping
act.
and
it
then
went
into
a
series
of
detailed
regulations
of
carriage
in
interstate
commerce
paralleling
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
provisions
of
part
1,
dealing
with
the
regulation
of
carriers
by
rail
within
the
united
states.
now
with
that
distinction,
going
back
to
the
shipping
act
of
1916
insofar
as
the
facts
of
foreign
commerce,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
statute
arising
out
of
a
lengthy
investigation
by
congress,
the
results
of
which
are
summed
up
in
the
so-called
alexander
report,
congress
undertook
in
19
--
with
the
shipping
act
of
1916
to
do
three
things.
it
undertook
to
correct
certain
specific
--
rather
specific
practices,
which
the
investigation
had
developed,
the
so-called
deferred
rebates,
use
of
fighting
ships,
and
discriminatory
practices
as
to
shippers
in
retaliation
as
to
shippers
who
used
bottoms
other
than
conference
bottoms.
the
second
thing
that
it
did
was
to
set
up
in
section
15,
which
is
the
pivotal
section
of
the
act,
the
real
scheme
of
regulation
of
carriage
by
water
in
foreign
commerce.
and
the
third
portion
of
the
act
was
to
set
up
the
commission
itself
or
an
administrative
body
provided
with
powers
and
provide
for
certain
sanctions
including
granting
of
reparations
under
section
22,
the
enforcement
of
orders
other
than
money
orders
under
section
29,
and
the
--
an
action
to
enforce
the
claims
asserted
when
a
money
order
was
made
and
not
complied
with
under
section
30.
now,
then
going
back
to
what
is
now
the
pivotal
section
and
that
is
section
15;
for
practical
purposes,
congress
adopted,
rather
than
the
regulatory
scheme
where
the
statute
itself
undertakes
to
regulate
the
activity
of
carriers
as
under
part
1
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
original
act
and
part
1,
it
set
up
a
scheme,
under
which
the
industry
was
to
regulate
itself
by
agreements
between
the
carriers,
among
others
these
conference
agreements.
but
the
very
important
thing
that
it
did
and
this
is
what
was
pointed
out
at
some
length
in
the
hearings,
looking
toward
the
adoption
of
the
bill,
it
provided
that
that
method
of
regulation
of
the
industry
could
operate
only
on
those
agreements
represented
to
and
approved
by
the
agency
set
up
to
administer
the
statute.
and
then
it
did
one
other
thing
and
we
think
this
is
the
highly
important
thing,
it
provided
that
those
agreements,
and
so
presented,
and
so
approved
to
be
accepted
from
the
operation
of
the
antitrust
statutes.
now,
it
is
our
position,
and
this
was
set
out
in
the
complaint,
that
these
agreements
of
which
i
have
spoken,
the
agreement
to
set
up
the
initiative
list,
the
procedures
with
respect
to
putting
items
on
the
initiative
list,
and
the
procedure
requiring
concurrence
before
the
rate
of
an
item
not
on
the
initiative
list
could
be
changed,
that
those
supplemental
agreements
were
never
presented
to
the
commission,
never
filed
with
it,
never
approved
by
it,
as
to
that,
there
is
no
question,
and
by
consequence,
are
not
accepted
from
the
operation
of
the
antitrust
statutes
and
to
use
the
language
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
dissenting
in
the
far
east
conference
case,
the
matters
are
set
at
large
or
to
state
it
a
little
differently,
one
of
the
things,
as
this
court's
opinion
in
the
east
branson
case
points
out
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
we
never
raised
that
question,
never
suggested
that.
there
are
no
facts
in
our
complaint
that
would
warrant
an
investigation
of
that
question.
we
stand
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
it's
not
the
rates.
the
rates
were
not
--
it
may
have
been
filed,
that,
i
don't
know.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
it
said
the
agreement
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
–
under
which
they
were
fixed
was
never
filed
and
never
approved
and,
therefore
under
the
procedure
that
congress
set
up
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
–
were
not
--
that
agreement,
under
which
they
were
--
was
not
exempted
from
the
antitrust
statutes
and,
by
consequence,
for
that
$2.50
a
ton
in
excess
of
the
only
lawfully
fixed
rate,
that
is
the
matter
for
which
we
are
suing.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
i
believe
that
is
the
practice
to
file,
but
i
can't
answer
that,
and
we
didn't
set
that
up,
your
honor.
it
was
a
matter
of
which
we
were
not
concerned.
we
were
concerned
only
with
the
method
by
which
they
were
fixed,
and
it
was
our
position
the
method
by
which
they
were
fixed
would
not
permit
this
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
it's
exactly
our
position,
your
honor,
exactly
our
position.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
that
is
a
different
question,
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
it
might
as
to
practices
or
otherwise,
it
might
disapprove
an
agreement.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
except
for
one
thing,
and
i
don't
want
to
be
super
technical
about
this,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
rates
in
foreign
commerce,
the
commission
has
no
power
to
fix
rates
or
determining
it.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
correct,
exactly.
we
say
that
an
unfiled
and
unapproved
agreement
is
the
same
status
as
a
disapproved
agreement.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
conceivably,
they
could.
conceivably,
they
could
say
that
this
agreement
is
operated
in
such
way
that
operation
under
it
is
so
prejudicial.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
and
not
for
the
purpose
of
fixing
them
as
such,
no.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
now,
it
is
our
position
very
shortly
that
the
matter
of
possible
impact
to
the
antitrust
statutes,
having
been
drawn
to
the
attention
of
congress
when
it
was
considering
the
adoption
of
the
shipping
act,
so
that
it
had
this
problem
of
how
the
antitrust
statutes
and
the
shipping
act
were
likely
to
affect
each
other,
interoperate,
and
so
forth.
with
that
being
specifically
drawn
to
its
attention,
congress
solved
that
problem
and
it
solved
that
problem
by
section
15
of
the
shipping
act
by
providing
that
the
agreements
for
the
regulation
of
the
industry
which
were
entered
into
should
be
presented
to
the
commission
administering
the
statute
and,
if
it
approved
that
they
should
be
exact
and
that
when
congress
has
so
specified,
and
i
know
of
no
case
--
certainly
no
case
in
this
court
to
the
contrary,
in
a
regular
industry
regulatory
statute
a
method
for
exemption
and
that
method
has
not
followed
which
has
held
that
the
parties
are
nevertheless
as
free
from
the
operation
of
the
antitrust
statutes
as
though
they
had
complied
with
the
statute,
filed
an
agreement,
and
had
it
approved.
now,
the
problem
which
really
presents
itself
then,
the
problem
which
arises
under
the
so-called
primary
jurisdiction
cases
and
it
arises
for
this
reason
that,
in
1932,
a
steamship
company
sought
to
bring
an
antitrust
action
against
conference
of
carriers
who
had
set
out
a
so-called
dual
rate
system
to
its
prejudice,
claiming
that
that
was
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
statues,
and
that
this
particular
dual
rate
system
had
not
been
presented
to
the
commission
and
had
not
been
approved.
mr.
justice
sutherland,
relying
upon
the
reasoning
of
the
decision
in
great
northern
against
merchants
elevator,
which
is
the
other
side
of
the
coin
from
the
famous
abilene
cotton
oil
case,
said
“yes,
whether
or
not
this
type
of
agreement
should
be
approved
is
a
matter
primarily,
which
calls
for
expertise
and
knowledge
of
the
industry
and
it
should
go
to
the
commission
and,
until
it
goes
to
the
commission
and
the
commission
has
acted,
the
court
should
not
act
and,
by
consequence,
the
action
should
be
dismissed,
but
there
is
one
thing
about
that
case
which
markedly
distinguishes
it
from
this
case.
we
are
seeking
treble
damages
only
for
past
and
completed
conduct
and
indeed,
before
this
action
was
commenced,
the
rate
had
been
returned
to
the
rate
that
it
had
originally
been
fixed
at.
we
couldn't
have
sought
injunctive
relief
as
to
the
future.
the
only
thing
we
could
seek
and
the
only
thing
that
we
did
seek
was
treble
damages.
but,
in
united
states
navigation
against
cunard,
the
plaintiff
was
seeking
an
injunction
which
would
be
operated
in
the
future
and
could
very
well
interfere
with
action
which
the
commission
might
take
in
passing
upon
the
same
question.
moreover,
in
that
case,
in
all
probability,
the
commission
could
grant
complete
relief,
it
can't
in
this
case
because
it
can't
award
treble
damages,
because,
by
cease
and
desist
order,
it
very
well
could
give
all
of
the
relief
that
was
sought
in
the
action
under
the
antitrust
statutes
which
was
seeking
injunctive
relief
only.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
single
reparation,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
we
did,
but
did
not
claim
reparations,
and
with
a
proceeding
started
by
the
commission
on
its
own
motion,
it
cannot
award
reparations.
in
other
words,
the
commission
cannot
force
a
party
to
proceed
before
it
for
reparations
and
take
reparations.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
more
than
an
election,
your
honor,
because
there
can
be
offenses
under
the
shipping
act
which
would
not
be
offenses
under
the
antitrust
statutes,
so
that
there
were
remedies
given
for
criminal,
civil
penalty,
and
reparation
sanctions
under
the
shipping
act
which
would
well-apply
to
conduct
which
couldn't
possibly
fall
within
the
antitrust
statutes.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
no.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
no,
i
think
not
because
the
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
to
administer
the
antitrust
statutes.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
the
same
facts
--
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
if
the
same
facts
showed
a
violation
of
the
shipping
act,
yes,
we
could
proceed
under
the
shipping
act
for
reparations.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
i
think
that
would
be
all
that
would
be
necessary
for
reparations
and
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
i
think
just
as
easy
as
the
antitrust
statute,
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
counsel
on
the
other
side
had
been
good
enough
to
tell
us
that
if
we
had
just
gone
to
the
commission,
we
surely
would
have
had
reparations
there.
now
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
under
the
shipping
act?
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
carrying
out
an
agreement
that
was
not
filed
and
approved,
that,
itself
was
a
violation
of
the
shipping
act
section
15.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
no.
oh,
the
commission
itself?
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
no,
it
also
found
discrimination
under
section
16
of
the
shipping
act,
both
as
to
the
pacific
westbound
conference
and
as
to
the
far
east
conference.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
apparently,
although
it
mentions
no
other
shipper
and
doesn't
set
out
what
the
nature
of
the
discrimination
is.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
yes,
your
honor,
carrying
out
the
agreement
without
filing
or
without
approval.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
because
the
act
makes
it
unlawful
to
carry
out
an
agreement
which
is
not
approved,
and
this
is
a
rate-fixing
agreement.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
operating
under
a
rate-fixing
agreement,
which
has
not
been
approved
by
the
commission.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
correctly
and
yes,
your
honor,
and
therefore
there
was
no
exemption
from
the
antitrust
statute.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
oh,
no,
your
honor,
we
still
have
to
show
that
the
agreement
was
of
such
nature
that
it
violated
the
antitrust
statutes.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
if
they
had
filed
it
and
been
approved,
we'd
have
no
case
at
all
because
of
the
express
exemption
provided
for
in
section
15.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
just
as
simple
as
that,
your
honor.
your
honor
is
quite
correct.
now,
the
only
thing
i
could
add
to
the
statement
of
the
cunard
case
is
that,
in
a
somewhat
similar
case,
the
far
east
conference
case
where
the
same
question
was
raised
in
a
suit
by
--
brought
by
the
united
states
for
injunctive
relief,
but
the
importance
of
that
case
is
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
his
opinion,
saying
that,
in
that
case,
it
was
proper
to
dismiss,
recognized
that
if
after-proceedings
were
completed
before
the
commission,
the
--
there
was
not
full
satisfaction
of
the
government's
claim,
then
it
would
be
time
to
consider
whether
or
not
the
government
might
not
go
forward
with
its
action.
if
i
may
suspend,
your
honor,
because
the
office
of
the
solicitor
general
must
present
the
views
of
the
solicitor
general.
