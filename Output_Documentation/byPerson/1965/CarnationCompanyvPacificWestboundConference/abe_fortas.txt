mr.

justice
abe
fortas
let's
suppose
that
instead
of
absorbing
the
excess
rate
it
had
been
passed
on,
would
the
person
to
whom
it
had
been
passed
on,
to
have
a
claim
for
reparations
under
the
shipping
act?
justice
abe
fortas
you
think
so?
they
would
have
an
antitrust
claim,
wouldn't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
if
they
had
a
claim
for
reparations,
then
i
assume
that
your
position
would
be
that
they
would
be
foreclosed
from
an
antitrust
action.
justice
abe
fortas
but
--
and
you
do
feel
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
whether
they
had
a
claim
for
reparations
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
turk.
justice
abe
fortas
in
your
--
as
you
look
at
this
case,
is
there
any
area
in
which
the
treble
damage
provisions
of
the
antitrust
act
would
operate
with
respect
to
the
rate
procedures
of
these
carriers?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
turk,
i
understand
your
point.
you
don't
rely
at
all
on
the
specific
language
of
section
15
with
respect
to
the
exemption
provisions.
in
other
words,
if
that
language
were
not
in
the
statute,
your
argument
would
be
exactly
the
same.
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
you're
doing
then,
if
i
understand
it,
is
that
you
are
inferring
from
the
structure
of
the
act,
in
the
absence
of
any
specific
provision,
you
are
inferring
from
the
structure
of
the
act
an
antitrust
exemption.
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
your
adversary,
if
i
understand
it,
makes
precisely
the
opposite
argument,
which
is
that,
since
the
statute
does
contain
a
specific
and
narrow
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws,
that
this
court
should
not
infer
that
congress
really
intended
a
much
broader
exemption
because
congress
was
specific,
it
was
indefinite
and
the
specific
indefinite
exemption
stated
in
the
statute
doesn't
help
you
in
this
situation.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
turk.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
agree
with
mr.
ransom
that
the
commission
would
have
no
jurisdiction
on
ex
post
facto
or
no
proto
basis
to
declare
lawful
these
rates
which
by
hypothesis
for
purposes
of
this
case,
were
unlawful
[inaudible]
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
mr.
ransom,
he
said
that
the
commission
would
have
no
such
power.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
far
east
and
cunard,
as
i
recall
them,
isn't
it
the
fact
that
the
--
what
was
sought
there
was
an
injunction
as
to
future
action
and
the
commission
did
have
jurisdiction
to
commit
or
disallow
the
action
in
question.
