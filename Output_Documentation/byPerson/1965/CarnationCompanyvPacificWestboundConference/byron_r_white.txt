justice
byron
r.
white
in
foreign
--
in
foreign
commerce
or
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
an
agreement
is
made
between
two
foreign
carries
or
two
carriers
in
foreign
commerce
on
rates,
setting
rates
in
so
many
dollars
and
cents,
and
that
agreement
is
filed.
now,
the
commission
can
either
approve
the
agreement
or
not
and
one
of
the
considerations,
as
mr.
justice
douglas
indicated,
is
that
they
might
disapprove
the
agreement
because
the
rates
are
so
high
or
so
low
as
to
be
detrimental
to
commerce
of
the
united
states.
now,
that's
a
different
question
than
the
reasonableness
of
the
rates,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
nevertheless,
the
commission
might
approve
--
disapprove
an
agreement
on
some
factor
related
to
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
position
would
be
exactly
the
same
here,
i
suppose,
if
agreements
have
been
filed,
the
rates
have
been
filed,
and
the
commission
had
disapproved
them
and
they
had
gone
ahead
and
done
it
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
it.
they
can't
fix
it,
but
they
can
disapprove
an
agreement
on
a
factor
related
to
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
might
say
--
they
might
say,
“we
disapprove
this
agreement,
you
can't
operate
under
it
because
the
rates
are
too
high?”
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
commission,
itself,
could
have
just
started
proceeding
and
say
“we're
going
to
investigate
rates
in
foreign
commerce?”
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
there
have
been
any
real
problem
about
your
recovering
reparations?
let's
assume
that
you
had
decided
to
seek
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you'd
approved
--
if
you
approved
an
antitrust
case,
could
you
approve
a
reparations
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
you
could
put
--
if
there
were
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
same
facts
could
prove
a
reparations
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
your
--
just
the
showing
of
the
violation
of
the
act,
whatever
it
was,
hurt
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
that
be
easy
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
could
you
be
hurt
by
that?
there's
a
violation
of
the
act
that
would
face
reparations?
you
have
faced
reparations
on
and
then,
not
file
it,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
not
filing
hurt
you?
let's
assume
you
knew
all
about
the
agreement
and
they
just
didn't
file
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
violation
of
the
act
is
operating
under
an
agreement
that
hasn't
been
approved?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
--
and
why
do
you
--
why
was
it
do
you
suggest
the
congress
felt
it
necessary
to
put
the
commission
in
the
--
in
section
15
with
regard
to
the
antitrust
laws
because,
i
take
it,
your
position
would
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
same
whether
the
provision
was
in
or
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
mean
that
this
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
isn't
what
i'm
asking.
i'm
asking,
originally,
they
put
in
section
15
that
agreements
filed
and
approved
would
be
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws.
that
provision
is
in
section
15.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
it
was
in
there
from
the
start.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
was
it
ever
necessary
to
put
it
in?
i
mean,
your
position
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
your
position
would
be
the
same
if
it
never
been
put
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
why
--
why
did
they
need
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
wouldn't
need
to
say
that
if
your
argument
is
correct.
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
approved
agreements
needed
more
protection
than
unapproved
agreements
under
your
approach
to
the
act?
