when
was
that
initiated,
mr.
dunne?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
before
this
suit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice

mr.
ransom.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
claim
--
do
you
claim
now
that
the
conference
had
the
right
to
do
what
it
did
in
this
case,
come
to
an
agreement
as
to
the
$2.50
raise
or
is
that
issue
foreclosed
to
you
now
by
reason
of
the
action
of
the
commission?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
can
the
commission
give
approval
to
those
illegal
acts
that
occurred
years
ago?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
the
recent
action
of
the
commission
would
not
inure
to
your
benefit,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
claim
the
issue
is
as
simple
as
mr.
dunne
has
stated
in
here
as
between
the
parties,
as
to
whether
you're
wholly
beyond
the
antitrust
laws
even
where
you
act
without
the
approval
of
the
shipping
board,
or
do
you
claim
that
the
issue
was
broader
than
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
still
don't
know
whether
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
agree
that
the
issue
is
as
simple
as
mr.
dunne
has
stated?
can
you
answer
that
categorically?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
as
simple
as
he
states
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
turk.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
turk,
having
thought
about
it
as
much
as
you
have
and
making
that
slight
distinction
as
to
the
antitrust
laws,
can
you
give
us
any
hypothetical
case
in
which
the
antitrust
laws
might
apply?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
wonder
--
i
wonder
why
if
it
was
to
be
that
simple,
why
congress
couldn't
have
said
so
in
very
simple
language
instead
of
the
language
it
used
in
section
15?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
all
purposes?
