but
before
you
go
on,
if
you
may,
i
don't
--
i
didn't
quite
get
that
last
point
and
i
wonder
if
you
could
illustrate
what
you
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
what
you
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
if
one
were
to
look
simply
at
the
--
at
the
first
generalized
statement
of
(b),
that
would
cover,
would
it
not,
the
--
and
embrace
the
alleged
wrong
in
the
present
case?
justice
potter
stewart
without
railroad
materials
--
justice
potter
stewart
without
reference
to
the
bill
of
particulars.

not
depending
on
the
steiner
case
here.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.

potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
doesn't
really
make
any
difference
to
the
question
involved
at
all,
does
it?
i
mean,
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
result
wouldn't
depend
on
that,
on
the
facts
--
justice
potter
stewart
whether
you
did
or
whether
you
didn't,
the
statute
either
applies
here
or
doesn't.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
it's
filed
in
the
same
court
or
a
court
across
the
country
3,000
miles
away.
