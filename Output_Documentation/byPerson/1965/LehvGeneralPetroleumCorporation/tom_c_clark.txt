your
--
your
case
involves
the
help
yourself
or
self-service,
what
do
you
call
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
your
defendants,
are
they
the
same
as
the
other
defendants
in
the
standard
stations?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you've
dealt
with
these
defendants,
your
man?
justice
tom
c.
clark
when
the
--
when
was
the
inception
of
the
help
yourself
idea?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
standard
station
was
filed
in
'50?
justice
tom
c.
clark
thank
you.
justice

mr.
kirkham,
when
you
deal
with
--
then
only
on
an
exclusive
basis
under
15,
couldn't
they?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
if
an
independent
did
not
waste
a
deal
on
an
exclusive
basis,
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
be
deal
with
an
independent
refiner,
would
he?
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
don't
you
think
it
says
that
if
the
action
is
based
in
whole
or
in
part,
on
what,
on
any?
justice
tom
c.
clark
any
matter.
so,
if
you
run
through
the
two
complaints,
i
suppose
the
state
is
going
through
the
complaints,
is
it
not?
justice
tom
c.
clark
on
the
pretrial.
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
a
vertical
conspiracy
running
from
production
through
marketing.
justice
tom
c.
clark
this
jobber
would
be
dealing
entirely
with
marketing,
wouldn't
he?
justice
tom
c.
clark
so,
that
depends
upon
whether
there
is
any
matter
in
the
government's
complaint
with
reference
to
marketing,
upon
which
the
complainant
here
could
hang
his
head.
