mr.
richard
g.
harris
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
matter,
we
have
had,
within
the
past
several
months,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
minnesota
mining
&
manufacturing
company
versus
new
jersey
wood
finishing
which
was
cited
in
the
brief.
in
that
case,
the
test
laid
down
by
this
court
for
determining
the
question
of
tolling
was
stated
to
be
“was
the
conduct
challenged
by
the
plaintiff
complained
of
in
the
government
action?”
as
stated
at
page
323
of
the
minnesota
mining
case.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
conduct
challenged
by
the
plaintiff
was
complained
of
in
the
government
action
and
referred
to
the
overt
acts
challenged
by
the
plaintiff
and
contrast
them
with
the
overt
acts
or
conduct
complained
of
by
the
government
in
the
following
particulars.
in
the
plaintiffs'
complaint,
we
alleged
overt
acts
consisting
of,
among
others,
controlling
the
sale
and
distribution
of
refined
gasoline
in
the
southern
california
area,
denying
independent
jobbers
access
to
a
source
of
supply
of
refined
gasoline,
preventing
independent
jobbers
from
obtaining
refined
gasoline
from
other
sources.
the
government
complaint,
on
the
other
hand,
at
paragraphs
70
(b)
(6),
(7),
(8),
(10),
(11),
(12),
and
(15),
charges
the
defendants
there
named
with
foreclosing
independent
wholesale
and
retail
markets
otherwise
available
to
independent
refiners
by
requiring
independent
jobbers,
wholesalers,
and
retailers
to
handle
exclusively
the
refined
petroleum
products
of
the
defendant
majors.
again,
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
states
as
an
overt
act
that
the
defendants
prevented
the
customers
of
independent
jobbers
to
retailers
from
obtaining
gasoline
with
which
to
compete
with
retail
service
stations
and
outlets
operated
or
controlled
by
the
defendants
there
named.
the
government
complaint,
on
the
other
hand,
charges
the
defendants
there
named
with
maintaining
agreed
upon
wholesale
and
retail
prices
by
refusing
to
sell
gasoline
to
any
wholesale
or
retail
distributors
who
refuse
to
follow
the
prices
fixed
and
by
adopting
the
uniformed
policy
of
refusing
to
sell
gasoline
to
any
wholesale
distributor,
jobber,
or
retail
dealer
who
would
not
agree
to
sell
the
products
of
a
single
dependent
major
on
an
exclusive
dealing
basis.
again,
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
charges
the
defendants
with
maintaining
fixed
artificial
and
uncompetitive
prices
for
the
wholesale
and
retail
sale
of
refined
gasoline
in
the
southern
california
area.
the
government
complaint
charges
the
defendants
there
named
in
almost
identical
language
with
fixing
and
maintaining
uniform
and
noncompetitive
resale
prices
to
the
charged
consumers
by
retailers
handling
gasoline.
the
plaintiffs
charge
as
an
overt
act
that
the
defendants
destroyed
any
substantial
competition
afforded
them
in
the
wholesale
and
retail
selling
and
marketing
of
refined
gasoline
in
the
southern
california
area.
the
government
complaint
charges
the
defendants
with
sharing
wholesale
and
retail
markets
in
the
sale
of
gasoline
by
standardizing
the
various
grades,
qualities,
and
structure
of
gasoline
and
by
selling
gasoline
and
other
refined
products
at
identical
prices.
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
in
the
private
case
charges
the
defendants
as
an
overt
act
with
controlling
the
sources
of
refined
gasoline
in
the
southern
california
area,
and
preventing
and
precluding
independent
jobbers
from
obtaining
source
and
supply.
the
government
complaint,
on
the
other
hand,
charges
the
defendants
with
fixing
and
maintaining
uniform
and
noncompetitive
prices
for
the
sale
of
gasoline
by
causing
the
posting
of
an
agreed
price
for
each
type
and
grade
of
gasoline
at
wholesale
distribution
points
and
by
causing
each
other
to
post
and
charge
identical
prices
at
such
points.
now,
from
a
comparison
of
those
overt
acts
alleged
by
the
plaintiff
in
the
private
case
with
the
comparison
of
the
charges
by
the
government
in
the
government
case,
it
is
submitted
that
the
test
of
this
court
in
minnesota
mining,
to
with,
was
the
conduct
challenged
by
the
plaintiff
complained
of
in
the
government
action,
is
more
than
satisfied.
however,
the
respondents
in
this
case
address
themselves
to
three
distinctions
which
they
urge
differentiate
that
conduct
which
has
just
been
compared.
distinction
number
one
is
that
the
complaint
in
the
government
case
charges
a
conspiracy
commencing
in
or
about
the
year
1936,
whereas,
the
complaint
in
the
private
case
charges
a
conspiracy
commencing
in
or
about
the
year
1948.
now,
again,
in
addressing
myself
to
this
distinction,
i
do
so
by
asking,
“is
the
government
complaining
of
conduct
in
1936
or
is
the
government
complaining
of
conduct
at
all
times
and
including
1948
and
right
up
until,
and
including
1950,
the
time
of
filing
of
the
government
antitrust
action?”
in
my
references,
i
will
refer
to
the
appendix
filed
by
respondents
of
the
government
complaint
since
it's
--
since
it's
in
a
brief
form
rather
than
the
typewritten
record
on
which
this
case
is
being
presented.
in
answer
to
that
question
of
1936
versus
1948
and
what
the
government
was
complaining
about
when
it
filed
its
complaint
in
1950,
i
refer
first
to
the
appendix
at
page
40,
which
takes
up
at
that
point
at
paragraph
number
21
of
the
government
complaint.
at
that
point,
the
government,
in
its
complaint,
points
out
that
the
conservation
committee
of
california
oil
producers
had
its
inception
in
1930
but
that
the
present
committee
was
organized
in
1936
and
goes
on
to
state,
in
effect,
its
formation
constituted
merely
a
reorganization
of
predecessor
organizations.
so
that,
the
1936
date
used
in
the
government
complaint,
i
submit,
is
clarified
as
the
date
upon
which
the
conservation
committee
of
oil
producers
was
reorganized.
at
page
49
and
50
of
the
appendix,
commencing
at
numbered
paragraphs
46
of
the
government
complaint,
it
is
to
be
emphasized,
that
in
describing
the
commerce
and
trade
affected,
the
government
is
not
talking
about
something
that
happened
in
1936
as
a
static
and
frozen
thing.
the
government
says,
as
of
january
1,
1949,
there
were
approximately
64
crude
oil
refineries.
their
complying
crude
oil
import
--
input
was
so
many
barrels
per
day.
again,
further
on
that,
as
of
january
1,
1949,
there
were
so
many
barrels
refined
from
the
refineries
that
were
opened
and
17
refineries
were,
at
that
point,
idle.
at
pages
52
and
--
at
page
50,
rather,
numbered
paragraph
50,
during
1948
the
total
gasoline
produced
by
refiners
in
the
pacific
states
area
was
approximately
120
million
barrels,
at
which
defendant
majors
produced
and
sold
approximately
108
million
barrels
for
approximately
90%.
at
pages
52
and
55
of
the
appendix,
numbered
paragraph
56,
the
government,
in
concluding
the
description
of
the
trade
and
commerce
affected,
uses
these
very
significant
paragraphs.
and
it
is
to
be
emphasized
that
it
was
emphasized
by
this
court
in
the
minnesota
mining
case
where
the
court
might
recall
there
was
an
argument
made
that
the
federal
trade
commission,
in
that
case,
was
put
to
a
burden
only
of
showing
a
possible
effect
on
competition,
whereas,
the
plaintiff
was
put
to
the
burden
of
showing
an
actual
effect
on
competition.
and,
the
court
pointed
out
as
a
significant
factor
that
the
federal
trade
commission
had
alleged
both
in
terms
of
possible
and
positive
effect
that
is
that
there
could
be
restraint
and
that
there
was
a
restraint.
so,
also,
the
government
in
this
case
alleges
speaking
in
the
present
tense,
not
about
1936.
each
defendant
major
requires
independent
distributors
who
handled
its
refined
petroleum
products
to
deal
exclusively
in
the
refined
petroleum
products
of
said
defendant
major,
and
to
refrain
from
dealing
in
the
petroleum
products
of
independent
refiners
and
marketers.
each
defendant
major
also
requires
the
independent
distributors
handling
its
refined
petroleum
products
to
sell
said
products
to
retail
dealers
and
to
large
consumers
at
prices
fixed
by
defendant
majors,
and
otherwise,
to
conduct
their
business
in
the
manner
desired
by
defendant
majors.
at
page
55,
each
of
the
defendant
majors
--
this
is
numbered
paragraph
62,
each
of
the
defendant
majors
requires
the
independent
operators
who
sell
its
refined
petroleum
products
to
purchase
the
requirements
exclusively
from
the
respective
defendant
major
and
not
to
handle
or
sell
the
petroleum
products
of
others.
at
page
58,
at
the
top
of
the
page,
except
for
the
area
within
a
three-mile
radius
of
los
angeles
harbor,
defendant
majors
enjoy,
in
the
present
tense,
a
virtual
monopoly
in
the
wholesale
and
retail
sale
of
gasoline
and
other
refined
petroleum
products
manufactured
and
sold
in
the
pacific
states
area.
now,
mr.
kirkham
will
undoubtedly
say
that
i
have
quoted
up
to
that
point
from
numbered
paragraph
4
of
the
government
complaint
which
describes
the
trade
and
commerce
affected.
however,
i
submit
that
is
relevant
in
determining
whether
the
government
is
there
talking
about
1936,
1948,
or
1950,
or
a
combination
in
a
continuing
thing
going
up
until
june
of
1950
and
thereafter
which
they
were
trying
in
1950
to
prevent.
however,
commencing
with
paragraph
v,
charging
the
actual
offenses
set
down
by
the
government
at
page
58,
numbered
paragraph
69,
the
actual
language
used
by
the
government
is
the
following,
“beginning
in
or
about
the
year
1936
and
continuing
thereafter
up
to
and
including
the
date
of
filing
the
complaint,
the
defendants
have
been
and
now
are
engaged
in
a
combination
and
conspiracy
to
restrain
unreasonably,”
etcetera.
in
numbered
paragraph
70,
“the
actual
monopolizations
have
consisted
of
continuing
agreement
and
concert
of
action
among
the
defendants,
its
potential
terms
of
which
have
been,”
etcetera.
and,
again
--
and,
finally,
at
page
66,
“in
concluding
immediately
before
the
prayer,
the
government
accuses
the
defendants
of
controlling
completely
the
competition
of
independent
producers,
retailers
and
marketers.”
and
you'll
recall
that
in
the
brief
in
opposition
in
this
case,
the
respondents
have
said
that
they
wish
to
ignore
everything
but
the
marketing
aspect.
of
course,
the
government
was
concerned
with
all
phases,
and
i
will
advert
to
that
shortly.
but,
the
government
specifically
accuses
the
defendants
of
controlling
completely
the
competition
of
producers,
refiners,
and
marketers.
the
defendant
majors'
quadruple
monopoly
of
the
production,
transportation,
refining,
and
marketing
of
crude
oil
and
refined
petroleum
products
“has
stabilized
completely
the
entire
oil
industry
in
the
pacific
states
area
and
has
resulted
in
the
elimination
of
all
price
competition
in
the
sale
to
consumers
of
gasoline
and
other
refined
petroleum
products.
now,
it
is
submitted,
therefore,
that
government
was
concerned
with
a
conspiracy
which
was
in
existence
at
least
from
1936
and
probably
earlier
than
1936
date
being
selected
because
of
the
reorganization
on
that
date
of
the
conservation
committee
of
california
oil
producers,
and
was
concerned
with
conduct
which
was
continuing
in
1948,
1949,
and
1950.
and
that,
therefore,
with
in
the
test
laid
down
by
the
minnesota
mining
case
of
whether
the
government
was
complaining
of
conduct
complained
of
in
the
plaintiffs'
complaint,
the
plaintiffs
submit
that
it
was.
as
stated
by
the
court
in
philco
versus
r.c.a,
cited
in
the
brief,
we
see
nothing
novel
in
stating
a
conspiracy
within
a
conspiracy.
and,
indeed,
that
would
seem
to
be
the
normal
situation
in
the
private
antitrust
case.
in
other
words,
the
government
is
concerned
with
conspiracy
in
a
grand
manner
on
a
grand
scale
covering
perhaps
the
nation
or
in
this
case,
the
five
western
states.
the
impact
of
that
conspiracy
on
a
local
level
is
what
the
individual
private
litigant
is
concerned
with,
and
it
has
been
referred
to
several
times
in
this
term
of
conspiracy
within
a
conspiracy
or
a
smaller
conspiracy
within
the
large,
and
seems
to
be
the
typical
pattern.
mr.
richard
g.
harris
yes,
mr.
justice
clark.
we
were
distributors
or
jobbers
of
gasoline
to
self-service
stations.
we
were
not
retailers.
we
sold
the
gasoline
to
the
retailer
who,
in
turn,
sold
it
through
a
self-service
channel.
mr.
richard
g.
harris
no,
they
are
not,
and
i
will
refer
to
that
as
the
second
distinction
urged
here.
the
defendants
do
not
include,
in
this
case,
the
conservation
committee
of
california
oil
producers
or
the
shell
oil
company.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
included
as
a
defendant,
now
dismissed,
the
olympic
oil
--
the
olympic
refining
company
which
was
not
included
in
the
government
case.
mr.
richard
g.
harris
yes,
they
dealt
with
the
defendants,
specifically
general
petroleum
corporation
and
olympic
refining
company.
mr.
richard
g.
harris
approximately
1947,
mr.
justice
clark.
the
date
being
selected,
it
received
nationwide
coverage
in
a
magazine,
life
magazine,
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
station
there
portrayed
was
the
very
station
that
my
plaintiffs
were
servicing
as
jobbers,
the
gilmore
station.
that
is
in
the
nationwide
magazine
showing
the
new
way
of
marketing
gasoline.
it
so
happen
that
the
gilmore
station
was
portrayed
in
that
magazine.
this
was
approximately
1947.
mr.
richard
g.
harris
june
of
1950.
mr.
richard
g.
harris
the
interesting
thing
about
the
idea
of
a
conspiracy
within
a
conspiracy
is
that
it
has
been
used
in
a
much
stronger
setting
than
is
urged
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
and
that
setting
is
under
section
5
(a)
rather
than
section
5
(b).
in
other
words,
it
has
been
used
as
prima
facie
proof
of
a
local
combination
or
conspiracy
from
the
national
combination
or
conspiracy
shown
to
exist
by
the
government
in
the
government
action.
and,
i
would
like
to
cite
two
cases
not
cited
in
the
brief
in
that
particular.
the
first
is
loew's
inc.versus
cinema
amusements,
a
case
in
which
two
of
the
members
of
this
court
were
on
the
brief,
reported
at
210
f.2d,
page
86,
the
tenth
circuit
of
1954,
page
86
particularly
page
90.
and,
twentieth
century-fox
film
corp.
versus
the
brookside
theatre
corporation,
reported
at
194
f.2d
846,
particularly
to
853,
1729
an
eighth
circuit
case,
1952.
in
those
cases,
we
had
the
concept
of
a
national
conspiracy
being
proved
to
exist
by
the
theatre
cases
which
was
then
applied
as
prima
facie
evidence
of
a
local-level
conspiracy,
and
this
was
again
referred
to
in
the
nisley
case,
which
i
have
set
in
the
brief
at
page
529
of
nisley.
now,
the
tenth
circuit
and
eighth
circuit
agreed
with
that
treatment.
the
seventh
circuit,
however,
when
faced
with
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
a
decree
would
be
used
as
a
prima
facie
evidence
which
is,
admittedly,
a
much
stronger
thing
than
the
plaintiffs
are
here
seeking.
the
seventh
circuit
refused
to
go
along
in
a
hypothetical
situation
which
is
stated
very
clearly
in
another
case
not
cited
in
the
brief,
sun
theatre
corporation
versus
rko,
213
f.2d
284,
at
page
290,
seventh
circuit,
1954.
in
that
case,
the
court
set
up
a
hypothetical
complaint
and
conspiracy
in
terms
of
a,
b,
c,
and
d
as
follows.
if
a
decree
is
entered
that
a,
b,
c,
and
d
have
conspired
together
on
a
national
scale
to
eliminate
competition,
this
decree
is
admissible
in
plaintiffs'
action
as
prima
facie
proof
of
the
nationwide
conspiracy
but
not
to
prove
the
existence
of
a
conspiracy
directly
affecting
any
particular
locality.
now,
the
tenth
and
eight
circuits
took
exactly
the
contra
view
of
that
particular
proposition
and
said
that
it
was
admissible
to
prove
the
conspiracy
at
a
local
level.
however,
when
the
seventh
circuit
addressed
itself
to
the
question
of
tolling
at
page
291,
it
said
as
follows,
“our
hypothetical
complaint
charges
and
our
hypothetical
decree
finds
that
a,
b,
c,
and
d
conspired
together
to
eliminate
competition
on
a
national
scale.
the
decree
is
prima
facie
evidence
as
to
this
question
only,
and
then
going
on
very
significantly,
p
rips
the
full
benefit
of
section
5
if
the
statute
is
suspended
as
to
the
parties
named.”
so
that,
apparently,
the
seventh
circuit,
while
refusing
to
apply
the
decree
as
prima
facie
evidence
under
section
5
(a),
would
nevertheless
suspend
the
statute
at
a
local
level
under
section
5
(b)
which
is
all
that
we
are
seeking
here.
the
second
distinction
referred
to
by
the
defendants
is
that
the
conspirators
are
not
identical.
mr.
justice
clark
has
already
pointed
out
by
his
questioning
and
i
have
stated
wherein
the
conspirators
are
not
at
--
conspirators
are
not
identical.
now,
this
was
a
relevant
test
under
the
steiner
case.
however,
it
is
no
longer
a
relevant
test
under
the
case
of
minnesota
mining
and
manufacturing,
as
decided
by
this
court
last
may,
because
under
that
case,
of
course,
we
no
longer
have
the
rules
of
or
never
did
have
in
that
case
decided
that
the
rules
lf
collateral
estoppel
were
no
longer
pertinent
under
section
5
(b)
while
perhaps
still
pertinent
under
section
5
(a).
therefore,
whether
or
not
the
defendants
are
or
are
not
the
same
is
not
any
longer
a
distinguishing
feature,
and
i
think
that
contention
has
been
completely
eliminated
by
the
minnesota
mining
case.
the
third
distinction
urged
by
the
--
the
respondents
in
this
case
is
that
the
cut-off
date,
that
is
our
overt
act
which
caused
us
damage
which
reached
us
and
hurt
us,
occurred
in
1954,
some-four
years
after
the
filing
of
the
government
complaint
in
june
of
1950.
however,
for
several
reasons,
this
is
a
distinction
without
substance.
number
one,
the
legislative
history
quoted
in
the
brief,
while
as
i
stated
in
the
brief
it
is
somewhat
ambiguous,
lends
credence
to
the
idea
that
violations
occurring
after
the
filing
of
the
government
complaint
are
likewise
to
be
tolled.
number
two
and
more
important,
as
a
question
of
policy,
certainly,
if
this
court,
as
it
has
committed
itself
to
do
in
the
minnesota
mining
case,
desires
to
give
the
full
benefit
to
the
private
litigant
of
government
antitrust
actions,
it
would
be
a
very
strange
rule
to
state
that
no
tolling
were
to
exist
after
the
filing
of
the
government
complaint.
it
would
be
as
if
by
magic,
all
offenses
were
to
stop
with
the
filling
of
the
government
complaint.
and,
in
fact,
instead
of
protecting
the
private
person,
it
would
hurt
the
private
person
and
that
it
might
give
the
persons
charged
in
the
government
complaint
a
right
to
do
things
as
to
which
the
statute
of
limitations
would
run
whereas,
beforehand,
the
statute
of
limitations
would
be
suspended.
finally,
this
same
situation
--
mr.
richard
g.
harris
yes.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
government
has
filed
a
lawsuit
in
june
of
1950.
mr.
richard
g.
harris
now,
let
us
assume
that
we
had
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
hurting
a
private
litigant
in
1949.
there
would
be
no
question,
assuming
that
we
have
the
necessary
holder
in
part
doctrine
under
section
5
(b)
complied
with.
there
would
be
no
question
but
there
would
be
a
suspension
of
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations
on
that
cause
of
action
for
as
long
as
the
government
case
was
filed.
in
this
case,
it
was
filed
for
a
full
10
years,
from
1950
to
1960.
however,
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
the
doctrine
and
say
that
any
overt
acts
happening
after
june
of
1950
are
not
suspended
so
that,
let's
say,
in
1954,
as
in
our
case,
we
were
cut
off,
we
alleged,
the
statute
of
limitations
would
run
on
us
and
we
would
be
barred
using
the
four-year
statute
which
is
now
uniform.
we
would
regard
in
1958,
whereas
the
cause
of
action
which
accrued
in
1949
would
continue
merrily
on
its
way
until
1961.
that
is
to
say,
10
years,
the
period
of
the
government's
suit
plus
the
one
year
extra
allowed,
which
is
a
very
anomalous
result
and
i'm
certain
that's
not
one
that
was
intended
by
congress.
mr.
richard
g.
harris
and,
the
green's
case
has
expressly
stated
that
this
should
not
be
so.
i
have
cited
the
green's
case
in
the
brief
but
not
for
this
particular
point.
and,
i
refer
now
to
page
336.
at
page
336,
green
says
as
follows,
“it
was
the
purpose
of
congress
that
a
person,
desirous
of
taking
advantage
of
the
use
as
prima
facie
evidence
of
a
judgment
or
decree
rendered
in
a
suit
brought
by
the
united
states
under
the
antitrust
laws,
might
have
an
opportunity
to
do
so
in
a
private
action
commenced
after
the
government
suit
had
ended,”
and
then
the
very
significant
phrase
added,
“even
though
his
cause
of
action
arose
while
the
latter
suit
was
pending,”
which
is
exactly
what's
happened
here.
our
cause
of
action
arose
in
1954
while
the
government
suit
was
pending.
that's
at
336
of
greens
which
is
in
232
federal
reporter.
we
submit,
therefore,
that
the
private
right
of
action
asserted
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
is
based,
at
least
in
part,
on
matters
complained
of
in
the
government's
suit.
this
is
all
that
is
required
by
5
(b)
and
all
that
is
required
by
minnesota
mining
laid
down
by
this
court
in
may
of
this
year.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
g.
harris
yes,
in
the
five
minutes
that
i
have
left,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
briefly
to
three
points
raised
by
the
respondent.
number
one,
he
points
out
that
the
complaint
in
the
government
case
and
the
complaint
in
the
private
case
were
filed
in
the
same
district
of
the
same
court
and,
therefore,
we
had
available
to
us
the
various
materials
that
the
government
had
unearthed.
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth.
similarly,
it
is
not
so
that
discovery
was
completed
in
our
case.
in
the
government
pleas,
the
files
were
very
early
sealed
by
court
order.
in
fact,
in
1950
or
1951,
i
moved
in
1958
or
1959,
i
don't
know
which,
to
unseal
those
files.
the
files
have
never,
to
this
day,
been
unsealed.
that
is
still
pending
because,
at
that
time,
judge
mathes
suspended
our
case
pending
the
outcome
of
the
government
case,
the
texaco
case
being
continued
on,
and
then
subsequently
decided
the
statute
of
limitations
issue
so
that
this
case
should
go
back
to
the
district
court.
at
that
time,
much
discovery
remains
to
be
completed.
the
government
files
have
never
been
unsealed
in
this
case.
i've
never
seen
them.
mr.
richard
g.
harris
well,
perhaps
not.
mr.
richard
g.
harris
the
inference
was
that
i
had
all
of
these
available
to
me
and
if
i
wanted
to
draw
the
complaint
this
way,
i
could've.
it
wasn't
available
to
us.
mr.
richard
g.
harris
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
g.
harris
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement,
mr.
justice
stewart.
now,
the
second
point
that
was
raised,
the
defendants
or
respondents
place
great
reliance
upon
the
fact
that
the
government
complaint
charges
that
the
defendants
agreed
among
themselves,
and
they've
even
italicized
this
language
at
page
3
of
their
brief,
as
the
court
has
probably
noted.
however,
this
argument
is
completely
laid
to
rest
by
the
goldwyn
case
which
they,
themselves,
cite
at
page
10
of
their
brief
because
goldwyn,
you'll
recall,
involved
a
government
conspiracy
alleging
that
the
theatre
people
were
attempting
to
conspire
and
did
conspire
and
combined
to
achieve
a
monopolization
of
theatres
that
has
retail
distribution
of
films.
goldwyn
was
an
independent
motion
picture
producer
and
it
was
argued
all
through
the
goldwyn
case
that
he
was
not,
within
a
car-see
language,
within
the
target
area
of
the
conspiracy
because
he
was
an
independent
motion
picture
producer
and
the
government
was
talking
about
people
that
were
conspiring
to
freeze
distribution
houses
of
motion
pictures.
and,
the
court
there
didn't
find
any
difficulty
at
all
with
that,
even
in
the
ninth
circuit.
they
said
that
even
though
the
government
talked
about
this
type
of
conspiracy,
goldwyn
could
still
be
hurt
by
it.
so,
the
fact
that
the
government
complaint
alleges
they
conspired
among
themselves.
it,
seems
to
me,
isn't
relevant
here,
insofar
as
we
are
claiming
that
we
have
been
hurt
by
the
same
conspiracy.
mr.
richard
g.
harris
well,
that
has
been
our
contention
from
the
beginning,
your
honor.
of
course,
we
haven't
seen
all
the
evidence
but
there
had
been
various
motions
in
this
case
from
the
beginning
to
limit
proof,
to
cut
off
proof
at
various
dates,
which
we've
always
resisted
and
said
we
wish
to
go
into
matters
going
back
to
1936,
1937,
1938,
and
so
on.
and,
this
is
all
part
of
the
pretrial
order
and
contentions
which
i've
set
forth
in
which
it
had
been
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
g.
harris
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
harris
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
harris
in
the
government
case?
mr.
richard
g.
harris
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
richard
g.
harris
yes,
that
is
my
contention.
i
assume
the
respondents
would
resist
the
same
as
they
are
here,
but
that
would
certainly
be
my
contention.
still
on
this
point
as
to
whether
the
allegations
between
the
complaints
are
the
same,
first,
the
charge
about
conspiring
among
themselves
has
to
be
considered
in
light
of
goldwyn.
and
then,
the
overt
acts
that
mr.
kirkham
referred
to
at
page
18
of
his
appendix
of
course
alleges
--
at
page
18,
he's
referring
to
matters
where
we
have
set
forth
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
conspiracy
alleged
at
some
length.
however
--
and
these,
we
submit,
are
quite
relevant
and
are
based
on,
at
least
in
part,
the
government
case.
however,
when
you
get
over
to
the
overt
acts
which
we
allege,
which
of
course
are
the
things
most
often
referred
to
in
the
decisions,
at
page
21
of
the
appendix,
paragraph
22,
the
overt
acts
are
practically
parallel
with
the
charge
of
the
government
complaint.
and
it
was
from
the
overt
acts
that
i
quoted
at
the
start
of
my
argument,
and
i
won't
re-quote
them
but,
considering
page
21,
i
don't
think
we
have
any
question
that
we're
talking
about,
in
the
language
again
of
the
minnesota
mining
case
the
matters
complained
of
by
the
government
in
its
case.
and
then,
finally,
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
ninth
circuit
relied
upon
steiner
from
simply
considering
the
opinion
which
is
part
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
of
course.
it's
true
they
cited
the
nisley
case
in
a
footnote.
however,
the
ninth
circuit
said
“from
steiner
versus
twentieth-century-fox
film
corporation,
supra,
this
court
has
already
held”
and
then
set
forth
the
test
of
steiner
“(a),
(b),
(c),”
then
said
“none
of
these
tests
are
met.”
now,
the
steiner
case
has
not
been
repudiated.
they
did
not
state
the
nisley
test.
they
quoted
nisley
in
a
footnote
but
it
was
no
question
that
steiner
was
applied
by
the
ninth
circuit.
thank
you.
