mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
should
say
that
there
are
no
disputed
issues
of
law
that
remain
in
this
case.
we
have
no
disagreement
as
far
as
this
particular
case
is
concerned
with
any
of
the
tests
that
have
been
urged
by
petitioners,
either
in
their
brief
or
at
the
oral
argument.
the
only
question
that
remains,
is
one
of
fact
on
the
test
that
we
concede
to
be
the
same
as
those
that
petitioner
has
stated,
was
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
in
this
case
based
in
whole
or
in
part
on
any
matter
complained
of
in
the
government's
complaint.
the
government's
suit
was
brought
in
1950.
the
plaintiff
alleges
--
plaintiff
in
a
suit
brought
in
1956,
during
the
pendency
of
the
government
case
which
was
finally
settled
in
1958.
the
suit
brought
by
plaintiff
in
1956
alleged
a
conspiracy
commencing
in
or
about
1948
which
injured
him
in
1954.
in
appraising
the
relationship
between
the
two
cases,
one
matter
should
be
kept
in
mind.
the
case
was
filed
in
1956
in
the
same
court
in
which
the
government's
action
had
been
pending
for
six
years.
the
government
case
was
familiar
to
the
plaintiff
and
if
there
had
been
a
cause
of
action
which
plaintiff
deemed
--
plaintiffs
deemed
was
one
that
was
complained
of
by
the
government,
certainly,
they
had
the
full
opportunity
to
plead
at
that
time.
secondly,
pretrial
proceedings
have
occurred
over
the
course
of
more
than
six
years,
thousands
of
pages
of
discovery,
and
the
decision
of
the
court
upon
this
motion
was
made
in
the
district
court
after
the
discovery.
there
--
certain
facts
have
come
out
which
are
undisputed,
which
served
to
clarify,
in
part,
the
situation
of
parties
upon
the
complaint
itself.
in
the
first
place,
as
petitioners
up
here
stated,
petitioners
are
what
are
called
rebrand
jobbers.
in
california,
as
in
many
states,
gasoline
is
sold
by
the
major
oil
companies
under
the
major
oil
brand,
standard
gasoline,
union
gasoline,
and
so
on.
under
the
statute
of
the
state
of
california,
that
gasoline
may
be
sold
to
an
independent
jobber
and
rebranded,
if
permission
is
given,
and
that
is
the
familiar
gasoline
seen
usually
in
the
stations
of
independence.
the
standard
of
california
might
sell
to
a
rebrand
jobber
of
gasoline.
that
will
be
rebranded
and
resold
as
gilmore
gasoline
and
its
station.
now,
the
essence
of
petitioners'
complaint
in
this
case
is
that
the
defendants
in
this
case
conspired
to
eliminate
this
type
of
operation.
he
was
a
member
of
the
class
of
rebrand
jobbers
and
the
defendants
conspired
to
eliminate
him
from
competition.
if
we
turn
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
in
this
case
which
is
set
out
at
page
18
of
our
appendix,
the
aforesaid
combination
--
i'm
now
reading
the
plaintiffs'
case,
“the
aforesaid
combination
conspiracy
to
restrain
trade
and
commerce,
and
so
on,
consisted
of
the
following
agreement
and
concert
of
action,
(a)
agreed
to
exclude
independent
jobbers
of
refined
gasoline
from
the
distribution
of
refined
gasoline
throughout
southern
california
area
by
forcing
such
independent
jobbers
out
of
the
market,
eliminating
a
source
of
supply
of
refined
gasoline
to
such
independent
jobbers,
eliminating
all
competition
by
or
from
such
independent
jobbers.”
there
followed
then,
numbered
paragraphs,
through
(h).
and,
the
only
important
or
significant
addition
to
the
allegations
that
i've
read
in
(a)
are
that,
in
the
succeeding
paragraphs,
the
complaint
alleges
an
agreement
to
eliminate
the
customers
of
independent
jobbers
or
an
agreement
to
maintain
monopolistic
control
over
distribution
or
so
on
by
fixing
and
controlling
the
price
at
which
gasoline
would
be
sold,
if
at
all,
to
independent
dealers
and
jobbers
selling
gasoline
in
the
southern
california
area.
the
district
court,
when
it
decided
this
case,
pointed
out,
in
line
with
the
particularization
of
the
issues
that
had
arisen
in
the
course
of
pretrial,
that
this
was
a
case
in
which
the
charge
was
that
the
major
oil
companies
and
olympic
oil
company,
named
in
this
--
in
the
plaintiffs'
complaint,
had
conspired
to
eliminate
this
type
of
marketer
from
the
market.
the
statements
by
counsel
in
the
course
of
the
pretrial
proceedings
were
so
limit
the
issues
that
are
set
out
in
our
brief.
now,
in
comparison
to
that
complaint,
and
i
may
say
that
i
feel
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
which
we
consider
to
be
one
which
is--
which
should
be
summarily
disposed
of,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
we
should
apply
the
broadest
test
that
the
court
would
possibly
apply
under
section
5
(b).
if
we
turn
to
the
--
the
allegation
of
the
government's
complaint
in
the
west
coast
case
and,
thereafter,
a
recital
of
the
description
of
the
industry
in
the
west
coast,
the
complaint
at
page
57
of
the
appendix,
under
the
heading
“control
of
the
industry,”
points
out
or
alleges,
which
was
never
proved
of
course,
that
the
oil
industry
in
the
pacific
states
area
is
controlled
and
dominated
completely
by
the
defendant
majors.
now,
that
suit
was
brought
against
all
seven
of
the
major
oil
companies
operating
on
the
west
coast
and
the
conservation
committee
of
california
oil
producers
which
was
alleged
to
have
been
a
tool
of
the
major
oil
companies
in
limiting
production
in
aid
of
their
monopolization
of
the
west
coast
industry.
it
was
a
typical
american
tobacco
case,
an
allegation
that,
in
an
oligopolistic
market,
there
had
been
a
concert
of
action
among
the
companies,
the
major
oil
companies
that
dominated
the
industry.
and,
in
paragraph
65,
after
reviewing
the
industry,
the
government
alleged
that
these
seven
major
oil
companies
controlled
94%
of
the
crude
oil
produced,
that
after
transportation
level,
they
controlled
approximately
97%
of
all
crude
oil
trunk
lines
and
70%
of
gathering
lines,
that
at
the
refining
level,
they
controlled
85%,
that
at
the
marketing
level,
they
controlled
86%.
and
then,
with
this
allegation
of
the
power
--
the
joint
power
of
the
--
alleged
joint
power
of
these
companies,
the
complaint
alleged
in
paragraph
69
in
the
general
language
of
the
sherman
act
that
beginning
in
or
about
the
year
1936
and
continuing
up
to
and
including
1950
when
the
complaint
was
filed,
the
defendants
engaged
in
a
combination
of
conspiracy
unreasonably
to
restrain
and
to
monopolize
and
had
monopolized
trade
and
commerce
in
the
production,
transportation,
refining,
and
marketing
of
crude
oil.
and
then,
specifically,
in
paragraph
70,
come
the
matters
complained
of
by
the
government
in
this
case.
the
aforesaid
combination
of
conspiracy
and
the
monopolization
have
consisted
of
a
continuing
agreement
and
concert
of
action
among
the
defendants,
the
substantial
terms
of
which
have
been
that
the
defendants
(a)
agree
to
eliminate
competition
among
themselves
in
the
pacific
states
area.
and,
may
i
ask
the
court
to
just
turn
the
page
to
61
to
the
(b)
allegation.
first,
they
agree
to
eliminate
competition
among
themselves
in
the
pacific
states
area.
secondly,
and
(b),
they
agree
to
utilize
their
control
of
the
production,
transportation,
refining,
and
marketing
of
crude
oil
and
refined
petroleum
products
to
restrict
and
to
eliminate
the
competition
of
independent
producers,
refiners,
and
marketers
in
the
pacific
states
area.
now,
under
each
of
those
subdivisions
of
the
alleged
conspiracy
are
the
terms
of
the
conspiracy.
they
are
set
out.
and
the
agreement
to
eliminate
competition
among
themselves
in
the
pacific
ar
--
states
area
was
by
stabilizing
the
amount
of
crude
oil
to
be
produced,
by
fixing
and
maintaining
uniform
and
noncompetitive
prices
to
be
paid
for
crude
oil,
i'm
reading
the
numbered
paragraphs
on
page
59,
by
pulling
their
respective
crude
oil
transportation
facilities
for
the
reciprocal
use
of
each
of
them,
and
then
come
the
allegations
with
respect
to
marketing
at
the
top
of
page
60,
by
sharing
wholesale
and
retail
markets
with
each
other
in
the
sale
of
gasoline
and
other
refined
petroleum
products.
and,
let
me
read
here
more
particularly,
(a)
by
standardizing
the
various
grades,
qualities,
and
structure
of
gasoline
and
other
refined
petroleum
products
in
such
manner
as
to
make
such
products
really
interchangeable
among
themselves,
(b)
by
making
exchange
agreements
among
themselves
which
permit
each
defendant
major
to
penetrate
markets
not
otherwise
available,
(c)
by
selling
gasoline
and
other
refined
petroleum
products
at
identical
prices,
thus,
confining
effective
competition
among
themselves
to
the
advertising
of
brand
names
and
the
offering
of
free
services.
then,
(6)
by
fixing
and
maintaining
uniform
and
noncompetitive
prices
for
the
sale
of
gasoline
and
other
refined
petroleum
products
at
wholesale
by
causing
one
to
post
prices
and
all
the
other
to
follow
those
posted
prices,
(7)
by
fixing
and
maintaining
uniform
and
noncompetitive
resale
prices
to
be
charged
to
consumers
by
retailers,
resale
price
maintenance
at
the
retail
level,
and
(8)
by
maintaining
the
wholesale
and
retail
prices
agreed
upon,
first,
by
refusing
to
sell
gasoline
to
those
who
would
not
sell
at
the
prices
fixed
by
the
majors
and
(b)
by
adopting
a
uniform
policy
of
exclusive
dealing
contracts.
now,
those
are
the
only
allegations
in
the
complaint
relating
to
marketing
except
that
under
(b),
which
is
the
only
allegation
in
the
government's
complaint
which
relates
to
the
exclusion
of
marketers
in
the
pacific
states
area,
there
is,
in
the
last
paragraph
of
(b)
on
page
64,
an
allegation
that
the
major
oil
companies
agreed
to
foreclose
independent
wholesale
and
retail
markets
otherwise
available
to
independent
refiners
by
requiring
independent
jobbers,
wholesalers,
and
retailers
to
handle
exclusively
the
refined
petroleum
products
of
defendant
majors.
all
of
the
other
allegations
of
(b)
relate
to
the
production
of
crude
oil,
conservation
committee,
and
to
the
alleged
activities
of
the
major
oil
companies
in
seeking
to
eliminate
independent
refiners
on
the
pacific
coast
area.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
if
one
were
to
look
only
to
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
if
there
had
been
no
other
allegation
in
the
complaint,
it
might
be
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
it
might
be
argued.
also,
it
might
be
argued
that
it's
69
only
--
paragraph
69
only
had
been
alleged
that
--
which
is
simply
the
allegation
of
the
violation
of
the
conspiracy
and
the
monopolization
and
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
and
nothing
else.
however,
in
response
to
that,
justice
stewart,
such
a
pleading
of
course,
with
no
trial,
no
case
would
ever
have
gone
to
trial
on
such
pleading.
there
would
have
been
an
immediate
motion
for
a
more
definite
statement.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
the
more
definite
the
statement
would
have
been
made,
and
what
the
government
complained
of
would
have
been
set
forth.
now,
the
very
significant
thing
in
connection
with
that
language,
mr.
justice,
is
this.
that
the
only
allegation
in
the
government's
complaint
that
relates
to
an
alleged
agreement
to
eliminate
the
competition
of
“independent
marketers,”
is
the
allegation
15
which
is
exactly
180%
different
from
the
right
of
action
which
is
alleged
by
the
plaintiff
in
this
case.
there,
it
is
stated
that
we
have
attempted
to
foreclose
independent
wholesale
and
retail
markets
otherwise
available
to
independent
refiners,
not
by
excluding
independent
jobbers
from
the
market
but
by
retaining
them
in
the
market
and
tying
them
up
with
exclusive-dealing
contracts
to
sell
our
products
instead
of
the
products
of
independents,
an
allegation
that
is
exactly
the
opposite.
now,
there
is
no
allegation,
in
the
first
place
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
under
15,
it
would
be
under
--
yes,
that
the
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
that
is
the
allegation.
that
we
would
tie
up
the
independent
jobbers
in
the
situation
of
the
plaintiff.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
no,
i
don't
think
that's
right,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
they
dealt
with
both
points.
they
dealt
with
the
three-year
statute
of
limitations
and
the
5
(b)
point.
is
that
what
you
honor
means?
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
no,
they
--
they
passed
upon
that
point.
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court,
both
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
referred
to
the
strict
rule
of
the
steiner
case,
and
perhaps
we
should
mention
that
a
moment.
ten
years
ago,
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case
--
the
steiner
case
and
there,
the
court
held
in
a
case
that
involved
the
question
as
to
whether
there
should
be
a
tolling
under
5
(b),
there,
the
court
held
that
in
order
to
be
a
tolling
there
must
be
a
greater
similarity,
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
8
of
our
brief,
the
small
brief,
“there
must
be
a
greater
similarity
then
than
the
same
conspiracies.
the
same
means
must
be
used
to
achieve
the
same
objectives
of
the
same
conspiracies
by
the
same
defendants,”
in
other
words,
the
same
overt
acts.
after
that
decision
in
the
steiner
case,
the
tenth
court
--
circuit
court
in
the
nisley
case,
union
carbide
against
nisley,
expressly
disagreeing
with
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
said
that
5
(b)
should
not
be
given
such
a
narrow
construction.
i
should
say
that,
in
reaching
this
decision,
the
ninth
circuit
applied
the
reasoning
that
5
(b)
should
be
given
the
same
interpretation
as
5
(a)
with
its
quasi
res
adjudicata
features.
it
followed
judge
wyzanski's
opinion
and
the
momand
case
in
doing
that.
in
the
nisley
case,
the
tenth
circuit
said
that
as
of
this
court
did
at
the
last
term
in
the
minnesota
mining
case,
that
that
was
too
rigid
a
test
to
place
upon
5
(b),
that
5
(b)
should
be
given
a
broader
application.
in
the
goldwyn
case,
which
came
up
later
then
in
the
ninth
circuit,
after
nisley
had
disapproved
and
disagreed
with
the
steiner
case,
the
ninth
circuit
held
in
that
case
that
the
statute
had
been
tolled,
in
a
motion
picture
case,
even
though
the
conspiracy
that
was
alleged
by
the
government
in
the
government
case
had
not
alleged
that
it
was
directed
against
the
class
of
persons
to
whom
the
petitioner
belonged
in
the
goldwyn
case.
they
adopted
a
more
liberal
construction
and
said,
as
this
court
said
in
minnesota
mining,
that
the
plaintiff's
case
need
be
based
only
in
part
and
not
entirely
on
the
allegation
--
the
matters
complained
of
in
the
government
case.
later,
the
--
this
case
was
decided
and
answering
your
question,
mr.
justice
douglas,
in
the
district
court
is
the
principle
point
considered
there,
as
it
was
in
the
court
of
appeals,
was
whether
the
three-year
or
one-year
statute
of
limitations
of
california
applied
to
this
case.
the
plaintiff
had
relied
upon
the
three-year
statute.
it
was
in
time
that
that
was
applicable
and
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
one-year,
and
not
the
three-year
statute,
was
applicable.
then
the
plaintiff
was
compelled
to
turn
to
--
to
rely
upon
the
tolling
statute
and
it
had
principally
relied,
of
course,
upon
the
three-year
statute
before
that.
and,
toward
the
end
of
the
district
court's
opinion,
the
court
does
consider
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff's
action
is
--
is
barred
or
is
not
tolled
by
5
(b).
and
there,
the
court
cites
the
strict
test
--
the
district
court
cites
the
strict
test
of
the
steiner
case
and
says
that
under
that
test,
the
statute
was
not
tolled.
when
the
case
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
the
court
of
appeals
cited
not
only
its
original
decision
in
steiner
but
it
cited
the
decision
in
nisley,
which
was
quoted
and
approved
by
this
court
in
the
minnesota
mining
case
last
term.
the
test
in
the
nisley
case,
as
i
take
is
really
the
test
in
the
minnesota
mining
case,
is
whether
there
is
a
substantial
identity
of
subject
matter
between
the
two
complaints.
and
the
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
i'm
not
depending
on
the
steiner
case.
the
steiner
case
obviously
was
incorrectly
decided
as
far
as
its
reasoning
was
concerned.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
i
am
stating,
justice
stewart,
that
there
is
not
a
conflict
of
decisions.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
and
that
the
representation
that
there
was
a
conflict
of
decisions
when
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
asked
for
was
mistaken
because
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
recognizing
specifically
that
as
earlier
steiner
decision
stated
a
more
rigid
rule
than
had
been
stated
by
nisley
and
having
said
in
the
goldwyn
case
that
it
would
reexamine
its
steiner
decision
when
the
case
--
a
proper
case
came
before
it.
in
this
case,
it
said
that,
under
either
the
nisley
case
or
the
steiner
case,
in
either
of
those
tests
there
was
no
such
identity
of
subject
matter
here
as
to
toll
the
statute.
so,
both
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
any
matter
complained
of.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
well,
it
--
it
could
be
based
--
i
think,
in
this
case,
it
was
based
upon
the
ultimate
issues
framed
after
pretrial.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
but,
we
are
prepared,
for
the
purposes
of
decision
here,
to
let
it
rest
on
that
or
upon
the
memorandum
of
contentions
or
upon
the
complaints
themselves.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
our
position
is
that
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
in
this
case
is
not
based
in
part
upon
any
matter
complained
of
in
the
government's
complaint,
and
that,
it
appears
to
us,
is
--
is
--
is
manifest.
now,
let
me
state
as
to
the
matters
that
mr.
harris
has
mentioned.
in
the
first
place,
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
conspiracy
commenced
in
1948
and
the
injury
occurred
in
1954
might
be
--
that
is
not
--
we
do
not
consider
that
that
is
determinative.
when
one
complaint,
the
government
complaints
--
complaint,
alleges
that
a
conspiracy
commenced
in
or
about
1936
among
seven
major
oil
companies
and
the
conservation
committee
and
when
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
comes
along
later
and
specifically
says
“my
conspiracy
commenced
in
1948
among
less
than
all
of
the
defendants,
six
of
the
eight
conspirators
in
the
government's
case
and
one
additional
company,”
then
at
least
that
is
a
flag,
an
indication,
that
there
--
that
there
might
be
an
entirely
different
cause
of
action
alleged.
and
that
is
particularly
so
when
the
facts
complained
of,
the
conduct
complained
of,
and
the
matter
--
subject
matter
of
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
is
a
phenomenon
in
the
oil
industry,
the
self-served
station,
that
came
into
existence
12
years
after
the
complaint
and
the
government's
case
was
filed.
but,
we
don't
urge
that
as
a
determinative
test.
obviously,
if
this
complaint
had
said
that
the
conspiracy
existed
in
1948
and
hurt
me
later
on,
there
--
and
the
government's
case
had
said
the
conspiracy
was
formed
in
36
and
continued
until
‘50,
there
wouldn't
be
any
question.
and
if
the
plaintiff,
instead
of
saying
existed,
said
the
plainti
--
the
conspiracy
commenced
in
‘48,
whereas,
the
government's
commenced
in
‘36,
applying
the
substantial
identity
test,
mr.
justice
clark,
i
don't
think
the
plaintiff
would
be
thrown
out
of
court
because
he
used
the
word
“commenced”
instead
of
“existed.”
so,
the
question
is
“are
the
conspiracies
the
same?
are
the
terms
of
the
conspiracies
the
same?
are
the
overt
acts
alleged
to
have
occurred
the
same
in
such
substantial
degree
that
it
can
be
said
that
they
--
that
the
plaintiffs'
case
is
based
in
whole
or
in
part
upon
any
matter
complained
of
by
the
government?”
so,
i
--
i
say
that
the
fact
that
there
is
a
specific
allegation
that
the
con
--
conspiracy
commenced
in
1948
and
related
to
an
event
which
had
not
even
been
in
existence
at
the
time
the
government's
case
was
brought
is
a
significant
factor
to
consider.
secondly,
on
the
members
of
the
conspiracy,
now
this,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
significant
fact
in
this
case.
the
government
alleged
that
all
seven
oil
companies
in
an
oligopolistic
market
combine
completely
to
monopolize
the
petroleum
industry
on
the
west
coast.
the
government's
complaint
would
not
have
been
the
same
in
any
way
at
all
if
it
had
alleged,
as
the
plaintiff
does
in
this
case,
that
not
all
of
the
major
oil
companies
but
only
part
of
it
had
combined
and
conspired
because
the
presence
of
all
of
those
companies
was
essential
to
the
conspiracy
which
the
government
alleged,
namely
an
overall
monopolistic
conspiracy.
when
the
plaintiff
comes
along
and
alleges
a
conspiracy
without
the
presence
of
the
shell
oil
company
or
the
conservation
committee,
which
was
--
which
was
kernelled
that
core
of
the
government's
case,
and
with
the
presence
of
an
independent
oil
company
as
a
separate
conspiracy
commenced
at
a
different
time,
then
you
are
very
definitely,
and
it
seems
to
me
uncontrovertibly,
stating
a
different
conspiracy.
they
can't
be
the
same
conspiracy.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
in
every
aspect
--
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
that
is
correct.
mr.
francis
r.
kirkham
well,
that
--
that
would
be
the
ultimate
test,
justice
clark.
i
think
the
first
test
that
you
apply
in
this
case
is
“are
the
conspiracies
the
same
in
any
way
at
all?”
now,
the
conspiracies
are
not
the
same.
the
government's
conspiracy
is
a
conspiracy
that
all
the
major
oil
companies
agreed
among
themselves
to
eliminate
competition
with
each
other
and,
as
it
is
alleged
in
paragraph
74
of
the
complaint,
to
conduct
their
businesses
as
though
they
were
under
a
single
management
and
a
single
ownership
in
a
complete
monopolization.
now,
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
later
on
did
not
include
the
shell
oil
company,
one
of
the
major
oil
companies.
it
included
an
independent
oil
company.
it
did
not
include
the
conservation
committee
and
it
did
not
allege
a
monopolization.
it
alleged
a
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
those
different
defendants
to
eliminate
a
particular
type
of
marketer
in
the
business,
the
rebrand
independent
jobber.
now,
if
the
test
is
“are
the
conspiracies
the
same?”
and
that
is
the
test
that
was
applied
in
the
nisley
case
and
the
goldwyn
case,
as
well
as
in
the
steiner
case,
then
obviously,
they're
not
the
same.
but,
coming
to
your
point,
mr.
justice
clark,
if
we
go
one
point
beyond
that,
and
we
say
that
you
look
only
to
the
--
you
have
to
separate
and
look
at
every
overt
act
or
every
term
of
the
conspiracy,
then
if
you
read
the
term
of
the
government's
complaint
one
by
one
through
the
38
paragraphs,
each
one
which
is
alleged
to
be
a
term
of
the
conspiracy
and
by
71,
the
complaint
has
alleged
that
the
major
oil
companies
did
the
things
which
they
are
charged
of
having
agreed
to
do
so
there
the
overt
acts
under
the
conspiracy,
if
you
separate
and
treat
each
one
of
those
as
something
complained
of
by
the
government
which,
in
fact,
it
wasn't
but
if
you
treat
it
as
a
separate
conspiracy,
still
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
doesn't
read
on
any
of
them.
now,
let
me
call
your
attention
to
those
that
refer
to
marketing
because
there
are
no
others.
they're
obviously
--
the
other
allegations
concerning
production,
refining,
and
so
on
are
not
the
same.
if
you
turn
to
page
60
of
the
appendix
and
you
look
at
the
four
allegations
there
that
relate
to
marketing,
paragraph
5
says
that
the
defendants
in
that
case
agreed
to
eliminate
competition
among
themselves,
and
let's
forget
the
overall
broad
conspiracy
part,
and
just
say
that
the
defendants
agreed
to
share
wholesale
and
retail
markets
with
each
other
in
the
sale
of
gasoline
and
other
refined
petroleum
products,
how?
(a)
by
standardizing
the
various
grades,
qualities,
and
structure
of
gasoline
and
other
refined
petroleum
products
in
such
manner
as
to
make
such
products
really
interchangeable
among
themselves,
(b)
by
making
exchange
agreements
among
themselves
to
prevent
defendant
majors
to
penetrate
markets;
(c)
by
selling
gasoline
and
other
refined
petroleum
products
at
identical
prices,
thus,
confining
competition
among
themselves
to
the
advertising
of
brand
names
and
the
offering
of
free
services.
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
that
reads
on
that
in
any
way
whatsoever.
there's
a
primary
price
fixing
and
elimination
of
competition
among
the
majors.
if
you
turn
to
(6),
by
fixing
and
maintaining
uniform
and
noncompetitive
prices
for
the
sale
of
gasoline
and
other
refined
petroleum
products
of
wholesale
by
causing
one
of
them
to
post
to
each
of
the
wholesale
distribution
points
an
agreed
price
for
each
type
of
grade
of
gasoline
and
by
causing
each
fee
of
the
defendants
to
post
and
charges
prices
identical.
here
is
an
allegation
of
primary
price
fixing
among
the
defendants
on
the
products
that
they
sell.
the
plaintiff
alleges
only
that
we
fix
prices
at
which
we
would
--
for
the
sale
of
product
to
a
particular
brand
or
type
of
distributor.
if
you
turn
over
to
his
allegations
on
page
18
again,
(b)
--
take
(b)
agree
to
eliminate
the
customers
of
independent
jobbers
of
refined
gasoline
by
refusing
to
sell
gasoline
to
independents,
refusing
to
sell
to
the
customers
of
independents,
and
fixing
and
controlling
the
price
at
which
gasoline
would
be
sold,
if
at
all,
to
independent
dealers
and
jobbers.
now,
an
allegation
of
an
overall
stabilization
of
price
at
the
primary
level
is
entirely
different
from
a
conspiracy
which
alleges
a
discriminatory
use
of
price
at
a
particular
level
and
with
respect
to
a
particular
class
to
eliminate
that
class
of
marketer
from
the
market.
reading
then
in
(7),
by
fixing
and
maintaining
uniform
and
noncompetitive
resale
price
to
be
charged
to
cus
--
consumers
by
retailers,
handling
the
gasoline
and
other
refined
petroleum
products
of
defendant
majors.
now
there,
again,
there
is
no
allegation
in
this
complaint
--
in
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
that
the
--
that
the
companies
have
fixed
resale
prices
at
the
retail
level.
and
then,
finally,
(8),
and
this
is
the
one
that
mr.
harris
read
to
the
court,
by
maintaining
the
wholesale
and
retail
prices
agreed
upon,
how?
by
refusing
to
sell
their
gasoline
and
other
refined
petroleum
products
to
any
wholesale
or
retail
distributor
who
fails
or
refuses
to
follow
the
prices
fixed
by
them.
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
that
there
has
been
--
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
that
refused
to
sell
to
persons
that
would
not
maintain
the
price,
resale
price
maintenance.
and,
that's
an
entirely
different
conspiracy.
so,
we
say
that,
upon
examination
of
it,
there's
no
issue
of
law
between
us,
no
conflict
of
decisions,
and
an
examination
of
the
two
complaints
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
they
are
not
--
that
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
is
not
based
in
part
on
any
matter
complained
of
in
the
government's
complaint.
thank
you.
