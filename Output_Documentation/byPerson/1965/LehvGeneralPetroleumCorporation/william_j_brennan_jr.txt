mr.
harris,
had
the
government's
case
gone
to
trial,
would
your
evidence
had
been
relevant
in
support
of
the
government's
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you're
talking
about
your
own
case.
i'm
asking
if
the
government's
case
had
gone
to
trial.
i
understand
the
government's
case
was
settled,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
after
you
had
brought
your
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
after
there'd
been,
i
gather,
considerable
pretrial
discovery
in
like.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
government
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
question
was
if
that
case
had
gone
to
trial
and
had
been
settled,
the
proofs
on
which
you
rely
for
your
case
have
been
relevant
to
the
proof
of
the
government's
case?
