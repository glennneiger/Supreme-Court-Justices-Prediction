justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
do
you
concede
the
principal
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
as
an
expense
for
administration.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
concede
that
the
bankruptcy
trustee
must
treat
taxes
incurred
by
his
predecessors
namely
the
debtor
chapter
xi
as
an
expense
of
his
administration?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
--
what
does
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
you're
conceding
that
--
that
your
bankruptcy
trustee
must
treat
--
must
pay
as
an
expense
of
his
administration.
justice
byron
r.
white
taxes
--
taxes
incurred
by
chapter
xi.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
prior
--
in
a
prior
chapter
xi
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
you
wouldn't
--
you
wouldn't
think
for
a
minute
that
after
there
had
been
a
difference
here,
if
the
debtor
had
himself
filed
that
--
if
the
time
for
filing
a
tax
return
had
occurred
during
the
time
the
debtor
has
been
in
possession.
and
the
debtor
had
filed
his
return
without
paying
the
tax,
you
would
still
say
that
bankruptcy
trustee
would
have
to
pay
that
principal,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that
but
i'm
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
the
--
well
then
do
you
think
if
the
--
do
you
think
that
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
had
an
obligation
to
file
a
return?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
--
you
mean
you
only
had
--
he
didn't
even
have
an
obligation
to
pay
the
tax
on
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
the
--
what's
to
keep
you
though
from
--
i
know
you've
already
conceded
it
but
what's
--
what's
really
--
would
prevent
a
bankruptcy
trustee
in
position
of
this
trustee
from
arguing
that
chapter
xi
taxes
should
be
paid
in
a
subsequent
straight
bankruptcy
proceeding
only
if
other
pre-petition
taxes
are
paid.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that?
what
provisions
of
bankruptcy
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
what
requires
you're
treating
this
--
the
principal
of
this
tax
as
an
administrative
expense
instead
of
--
instead
of
as
a
pre-petitioned
accrued
tax
obligation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
that
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
agreed
but
this
--
this
was
not
incurred.
this
was
not
incurred
after
the
petition
in
bankruptcy.
yes,
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
concede
then
that
we
have
to
--
that
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
--
that
the
bankruptcy
trustee
himself
has
to
go
back
to
the
original
filing
date?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
picked
up
--
do
you
pick
up
all
the
obligations
then
that
the
--
that
the
chapter
xi
trustee
or
debtor
possession
had?
justice
byron
r.
white
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
chapter
xi
proceeding
had
lasted
long
enough
for
the
--
for
the
debtor
to
file
but
not
pay
the
tax
and
to
accrue
some
interest.
and
then
the
tap
--
then
the
--
then
the
bankruptcy
petition
had
been
filed.
then
i
suppose
the
interest
up
to
the
date
of
the
bankruptcy
petition
at
least
would
be
--
would
go
along
with
the
principal.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
why
did
you
file
a
statement
of
expenses?
why
didn't
you
file
a
petition
for
a
turnover
where
there
is
a
declamation
particularly
or
something
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
mean
to
tell
me
that
your
--
that
your
trust
there
disappears
because
there's
commingling.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
means
you're
bringing
us
here
though
under
your
own
administration
expense
theory.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
what
it's
up
here
on
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
--
if
you
wanted
to
litigate
it
on
another
basis,
you
ought
to
go
ahead
and
litigate
it
on
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
that
--
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
priority
here
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
nobody
did
really
disputes
you
that
if
--
if
the
debtor
had
gone
on
operating
the
business
and
hadn't
paid
his
taxes
--
paid
these
taxes
that
it
would
have
to
pay
interest.
the
real
question
is
the
--
that
there
is
a
straight
bankruptcy
that
intervenes
at
some
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
by
the
way,
could
you
tell
me
the
provision
in
the
code,
are
there
any,
or
the
bankruptcy
act
which
imposes
on
the
bankruptcy
trustee.
the
obligation
to
file
a
tax
return
for
a
debtor
in
possession
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
incurred
the
taxes
but
which
were
not
due
or
payable
until
after
a
bankruptcy
petition
had
intervened.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
internal
revenue
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
the
bankruptcy
trustee
inherited
the
obligation
to
pay
the
tax
and
to
file
a
return.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
might
that
even
that
just
gets
you
though,
that
just
gets
you
to
the
point
to
ensure
the
bankruptcy
trustee
owes
the
tax.
he
owes
that
principal
of
the
tax
then
he
has
to
pay
it.
and
that's
conceded
by
the
other
side.
and
--
but
what's
really
an
issue
here
is
--
was
when
do
they
have
to
pay
it
and
in
what
circumstance?do
you
--
do
you
agree
that
--
do
you
agree
that
there
are
two
categories
of
administration
expenses
under
64(a)
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
just
a
minute.
now,
let's
just
assume
for
the
moment
that
if
you
were
the
--
bankruptcy
trustee
has
to
pay
the
tax,
the
principal
of
the
tax,
but
he
only
has
to
pay
it
as
an
administration
of
expense
when
in
as
administration
expenses
are
normally
paid.
and
he
finds
when
he
takes
over
as
trustee,
sure,
i
owe
a
tax.
and
under
64(a),
i
am
liable
to
pay
it
as
an
expense
of
administration.
when
as
and
if,
administrative
expenses
are
allowed
and
paid,
and
that
doesn't
mean,
and
that
this
principal
of
this
tax
would
be
subordinate
to
my
own
administration
expenses,
and
hence,
i
cannot
pay
it
on
january
20
or
whatever
date
it
was,
because
if
i
pay
it
now,
i
could
never
pay
the
priority
administrative
--
administration
expenses.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
think
it
does
violence
to
it
at
all.
it
serves
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
accepts
the
claim,
the
trustee
says
i've
--
we're
all
then
proceeding
here,
i
accept
and
i
--
and
i
have
to
pay
as
an
expense
for
administration
the
tax
that
is
already
approved.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
want
to
go
and
say
--
and
not
only
that
but
you
have
to
pay
it
on
january
20
and
file
a
return
or
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't
unless
you
don't.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't
unless
you
don't
file
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
wouldn't
--
if
he
doesn't
--
if
he
isn't
liable
to
pay
the
tax
on
that
date,
you
really
wouldn't
care
whether
he
filed
a
return
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
want
to
go
to
the
next
step,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
situation
where
there's
--
where
there
is
only
x
dollars
in
the
estate
and
the
prebankruptcy
petition,
the
chapter
xi
tax
obligation
equals
the
amount
of
the
assets.
now,
what
should
the
bankruptcy
trustee
should
do
to
--
trustee
do?
pay
it
on
january
20
and
then
have
no
funds
for
priority
administration
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
get
you
by
the
penalty,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
no,
or
only
at
the
expense
of
that
same
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
say
he
had
been
on
position
that
he
would
be
involved
with
respect
to
any
other
obligation
of
the
chapter
xi
proceeding
which
bears
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
not
so
--
if
he
were,
what
he
would
do
is
subordinate.
he
would
subordinate
the
chapter
xi
administrative
expenses
to
the
expenses
of
the
bankruptcy
petition
--
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there's
not
enough
to
pay
both,
who
gets
paid
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
wait
a
minute
now,
you
can't
go
back
on
that
now.
let's
talk
about
just
administrative
expenses.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
wouldn't
come
first
though
if
he
had
already
paid
them
out
on
january
20
when
they
were
due
according
to
you.
you
would
just
reverse
the
priorities
that
were
set
up
in
64(a).
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
find
--
i
just
don't
agree
with
you.
i
think
if
it
accepts
it,
he
walks
right
up
to
you
and
says,
“i
know
that
chapter
xi
proceeding
owe
some
taxes
and
i'm
going
to
pay
him
as
an
expense
of
the
administration
according
to
the
priority
that
they're
given.”
that's
what
he
says
and
i
don't
know
--
now
how
do
you
--
what
do
you
mean
that
ignores
the
continuity?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
were
a
bankruptcy
trustee,
and
that
you
had
the
basic
problem
of
it,
what
is
the
effect
to
pay
the
tax
now
and
perhaps
run
out
of
money
before
you
pay
the
priority
administrative
expenses
and
have
to
rely
on
getting
the
money
back
to
the
united
states.and
do
you
think
you
might
be
subject
to
some
surcharge
yourself
as
trustee?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
i
were
a
creditor
for
other
administrative
expenses,
i
wouldn't
like
that
much
because
you'd
already
spend
my
money
on
somebody
that
i
have
priority
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
featherston,
you
ask
me
this,
let's
assume
that
in
chapter
xi
proceeding,
the
debtor
in
possession
incurs
an
obligation
for
this
body
under
an
invoice
that
says
that
this
is
not
paid
when
due,
it
will
draw
6%
interest
and
it's
due
30
days
after
the
invoice.
and
before
the
30
days
is
up,
there
is
a
straight
bankruptcy
if
there's
adjudication.
and
the
bankruptcy
trustee
says,
“well,
here
i
owed
for
this
lumber,”
or
whatever
it
was,
then
that,
“as
a
second
class
administration
expense.”
and
he
treats
this
as
such
but
the
claimant
filed
a
statement
of
expenses
and
he
wants
interest.
he
wants
that
at
6%
interest
on
that
post-bankruptcy
petition
interest.
first
sought
to
the
terms
of
the
invoice,
what's
the
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
was
at
chapter
xi.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
let's
just
--
let's
just
assume
that
the
obligations
to
pay
that
the
--
the
lumber
--
the
purchasing
of
the
lumber
was
authorized,
and
the
terms
were
authorized
by
the
court,
namely,
if
not
paid
when
due
it
would
draws
6%
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
right
on
--
right
on
through
the
bankruptcy.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
to
say
that
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
what
you're
really
getting
at
is
you're
not
--
there's
no
basis
for
distinguishing
the
private
claim
from
the
government's
tax
claims
in
this
regard.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
--
now
just
remember
that
the
--
that
this
straight
bankruptcy
intervenes
in
this
30-day
invoice.
and
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
pays
the
invoice
when
it's
due.
well,
how
about
--
is
he
entitled
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me,
you
can't
get
me
this
time
with
that
because
all
the
court
did
was
--
all
the
court
did
was
approve
the
terms
of
the
contract
which
was
payment
30
days
hence
with
6%
interest
afterwards.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
there
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
i
just
want
to
ask
you
that.
can
he
pay
it
when
it
comes
due?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
why
are
you
getting
it
back
in
that
private
creditor?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
think
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
would
be
entitled
to
pay
that
on
and
would
have
to
do
these
the
payment
and
indeed
they
have
to
do
these
payments.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
really
is
a
--
really
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
didn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
what's
you're
answer
to
mr.
featherston
of
this
question,
what
banker
or
what
lender
in
his
right
mind
would
ever
lend
a
dollar
to
an
operating
trustee
under
chapter
x
or
chapter
xi
situation
if
all
that
has
to
happen
was
a
bankruptcy
to
intervene
and
can
have
a
--
and
he
would
never
reflect
another
dollar
of
interest,
who
would
ever
done
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you've
been
saying
is
that
--
or
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
you're
just
not
going
to
have
chapter
--
effective
chapter
x
and
chapter
xi
borrowing
that
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
doesn't
solve
the
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
giving
collateral
doesn't
solve
the
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
on
the
list,
it's
on
the
other.
i
don't
--
now
talking
about
his
principal.
i'm
talking
about
if
he'd
be
able
to
earn
something
from
his
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
court
approval
of
a
--
of
any
of
these
transactions
wouldn't
be
an
answer
to
you
--
wouldn't
give
you
any
answer
of
--
that's
all
you
have
to
have
you
move
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
do
you
concede
the
principal
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
as
an
expense
for
administration.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
concede
that
the
bankruptcy
trustee
must
treat
taxes
incurred
by
his
predecessors
namely
the
debtor
chapter
xi
as
an
expense
of
his
administration?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
--
what
does
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
you're
conceding
that
--
that
your
bankruptcy
trustee
must
treat
--
must
pay
as
an
expense
of
his
administration.
justice
byron
r.
white
taxes
--
taxes
incurred
by
chapter
xi.
justice
byron

white
in
a
prior
--
in
a
prior
chapter
xi
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
you
wouldn't
--
you
wouldn't
think
for
a
minute
that
after
there
had
been
a
difference
here,
if
the
debtor
had
himself
filed
that
--
if
the
time
for
filing
a
tax
return
had
occurred
during
the
time
the
debtor
has
been
in
possession.
and
the
debtor
had
filed
his
return
without
paying
the
tax,
you
would
still
say
that
bankruptcy
trustee
would
have
to
pay
that
principal,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that
but
i'm
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
the
--
well
then
do
you
think
if
the
--
do
you
think
that
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
had
an
obligation
to
file
a
return?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
--
you
mean
you
only
had
--
he
didn't
even
have
an
obligation
to
pay
the
tax
on
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
the
--
what's
to
keep
you
though
from
--
i
know
you've
already
conceded
it
but
what's
--
what's
really
--
would
prevent
a
bankruptcy
trustee
in
position
of
this
trustee
from
arguing
that
chapter
xi
taxes
should
be
paid
in
a
subsequent
straight
bankruptcy
proceeding
only
if
other
pre-petition
taxes
are
paid.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that?
what
provisions
of
bankruptcy
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
what
requires
you're
treating
this
--
the
principal
of
this
tax
as
an
administrative
expense
instead
of
--
instead
of
as
a
pre-petitioned
accrued
tax
obligation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
that
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
agreed
but
this
--
this
was
not
incurred.
this
was
not
incurred
after
the
petition
in
bankruptcy.
yes,
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
concede
then
that
we
have
to
--
that
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
--
that
the
bankruptcy
trustee
himself
has
to
go
back
to
the
original
filing
date?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
picked
up
--
do
you
pick
up
all
the
obligations
then
that
the
--
that
the
chapter
xi
trustee
or
debtor
possession
had?
justice
byron
r.
white
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
chapter
xi
proceeding
had
lasted
long
enough
for
the
--
for
the
debtor
to
file
but
not
pay
the
tax
and
to
accrue
some
interest.
and
then
the
tap
--
then
the
--
then
the
bankruptcy
petition
had
been
filed.
then
i
suppose
the
interest
up
to
the
date
of
the
bankruptcy
petition
at
least
would
be
--
would
go
along
with
the
principal.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
why
did
you
file
a
statement
of
expenses?
why
didn't
you
file
a
petition
for
a
turnover
where
there
is
a
declamation
particularly
or
something
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
mean
to
tell
me
that
your
--
that
your
trust
there
disappears
because
there's
commingling.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
means
you're
bringing
us
here
though
under
your
own
administration
expense
theory.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
what
it's
up
here
on
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
--
if
you
wanted
to
litigate
it
on
another
basis,
you
ought
to
go
ahead
and
litigate
it
on
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
that
--
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
priority
here
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
nobody
did
really
disputes
you
that
if
--
if
the
debtor
had
gone
on
operating
the
business
and
hadn't
paid
his
taxes
--
paid
these
taxes
that
it
would
have
to
pay
interest.
the
real
question
is
the
--
that
there
is
a
straight
bankruptcy
that
intervenes
at
some
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
by
the
way,
could
you
tell
me
the
provision
in
the
code,
are
there
any,
or
the
bankruptcy
act
which
imposes
on
the
bankruptcy
trustee.
the
obligation
to
file
a
tax
return
for
a
debtor
in
possession
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
incurred
the
taxes
but
which
were
not
due
or
payable
until
after
a
bankruptcy
petition
had
intervened.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
internal
revenue
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
the
bankruptcy
trustee
inherited
the
obligation
to
pay
the
tax
and
to
file
a
return.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
might
that
even
that
just
gets
you
though,
that
just
gets
you
to
the
point
to
ensure
the
bankruptcy
trustee
owes
the
tax.
he
owes
that
principal
of
the
tax
then
he
has
to
pay
it.
and
that's
conceded
by
the
other
side.
and
--
but
what's
really
an
issue
here
is
--
was
when
do
they
have
to
pay
it
and
in
what
circumstance?do
you
--
do
you
agree
that
--
do
you
agree
that
there
are
two
categories
of
administration
expenses
under
64(a)
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
just
a
minute.
now,
let's
just
assume
for
the
moment
that
if
you
were
the
--
bankruptcy
trustee
has
to
pay
the
tax,
the
principal
of
the
tax,
but
he
only
has
to
pay
it
as
an
administration
of
expense
when
in
as
administration
expenses
are
normally
paid.
and
he
finds
when
he
takes
over
as
trustee,
sure,
i
owe
a
tax.
and
under
64(a),
i
am
liable
to
pay
it
as
an
expense
of
administration.
when
as
and
if,
administrative
expenses
are
allowed
and
paid,
and
that
doesn't
mean,
and
that
this
principal
of
this
tax
would
be
subordinate
to
my
own
administration
expenses,
and
hence,
i
cannot
pay
it
on
january
20
or
whatever
date
it
was,
because
if
i
pay
it
now,
i
could
never
pay
the
priority
administrative
--
administration
expenses.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
think
it
does
violence
to
it
at
all.
it
serves
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
accepts
the
claim,
the
trustee
says
i've
--
we're
all
then
proceeding
here,
i
accept
and
i
--
and
i
have
to
pay
as
an
expense
for
administration
the
tax
that
is
already
approved.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
want
to
go
and
say
--
and
not
only
that
but
you
have
to
pay
it
on
january
20
and
file
a
return
or
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't
unless
you
don't.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't
unless
you
don't
file
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
wouldn't
--
if
he
doesn't
--
if
he
isn't
liable
to
pay
the
tax
on
that
date,
you
really
wouldn't
care
whether
he
filed
a
return
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
want
to
go
to
the
next
step,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
situation
where
there's
--
where
there
is
only
x
dollars
in
the
estate
and
the
prebankruptcy
petition,
the
chapter
xi
tax
obligation
equals
the
amount
of
the
assets.
now,
what
should
the
bankruptcy
trustee
should
do
to
--
trustee
do?
pay
it
on
january
20
and
then
have
no
funds
for
priority
administration
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
get
you
by
the
penalty,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
no,
or
only
at
the
expense
of
that
same
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
say
he
had
been
on
position
that
he
would
be
involved
with
respect
to
any
other
obligation
of
the
chapter
xi
proceeding
which
bears
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
not
so
--
if
he
were,
what
he
would
do
is
subordinate.
he
would
subordinate
the
chapter
xi
administrative
expenses
to
the
expenses
of
the
bankruptcy
petition
--
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there's
not
enough
to
pay
both,
who
gets
paid
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
wait
a
minute
now,
you
can't
go
back
on
that
now.
let's
talk
about
just
administrative
expenses.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
wouldn't
come
first
though
if
he
had
already
paid
them
out
on
january
20
when
they
were
due
according
to
you.
you
would
just
reverse
the
priorities
that
were
set
up
in
64(a).
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
find
--
i
just
don't
agree
with
you.
i
think
if
it
accepts
it,
he
walks
right
up
to
you
and
says,
“i
know
that
chapter
xi
proceeding
owe
some
taxes
and
i'm
going
to
pay
him
as
an
expense
of
the
administration
according
to
the
priority
that
they're
given.”
that's
what
he
says
and
i
don't
know
--
now
how
do
you
--
what
do
you
mean
that
ignores
the
continuity?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
were
a
bankruptcy
trustee,
and
that
you
had
the
basic
problem
of
it,
what
is
the
effect
to
pay
the
tax
now
and
perhaps
run
out
of
money
before
you
pay
the
priority
administrative
expenses
and
have
to
rely
on
getting
the
money
back
to
the
united
states.and
do
you
think
you
might
be
subject
to
some
surcharge
yourself
as
trustee?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
i
were
a
creditor
for
other
administrative
expenses,
i
wouldn't
like
that
much
because
you'd
already
spend
my
money
on
somebody
that
i
have
priority
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
featherston,
you
ask
me
this,
let's
assume
that
in
chapter
xi
proceeding,
the
debtor
in
possession
incurs
an
obligation
for
this
body
under
an
invoice
that
says
that
this
is
not
paid
when
due,
it
will
draw
6%
interest
and
it's
due
30
days
after
the
invoice.
and
before
the
30
days
is
up,
there
is
a
straight
bankruptcy
if
there's
adjudication.
and
the
bankruptcy
trustee
says,
“well,
here
i
owed
for
this
lumber,”
or
whatever
it
was,
then
that,
“as
a
second
class
administration
expense.”
and
he
treats
this
as
such
but
the
claimant
filed
a
statement
of
expenses
and
he
wants
interest.
he
wants
that
at
6%
interest
on
that
post-bankruptcy
petition
interest.
first
sought
to
the
terms
of
the
invoice,
what's
the
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
was
at
chapter
xi.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
let's
just
--
let's
just
assume
that
the
obligations
to
pay
that
the
--
the
lumber
--
the
purchasing
of
the
lumber
was
authorized,
and
the
terms
were
authorized
by
the
court,
namely,
if
not
paid
when
due
it
would
draws
6%
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
right
on
--
right
on
through
the
bankruptcy.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
to
say
that
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
what
you're
really
getting
at
is
you're
not
--
there's
no
basis
for
distinguishing
the
private
claim
from
the
government's
tax
claims
in
this
regard.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
--
now
just
remember
that
the
--
that
this
straight
bankruptcy
intervenes
in
this
30-day
invoice.
and
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
pays
the
invoice
when
it's
due.
well,
how
about
--
is
he
entitled
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me,
you
can't
get
me
this
time
with
that
because
all
the
court
did
was
--
all
the
court
did
was
approve
the
terms
of
the
contract
which
was
payment
30
days
hence
with
6%
interest
afterwards.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
there
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
i
just
want
to
ask
you
that.
can
he
pay
it
when
it
comes
due?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
why
are
you
getting
it
back
in
that
private
creditor?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
think
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
would
be
entitled
to
pay
that
on
and
would
have
to
do
these
the
payment
and
indeed
they
have
to
do
these
payments.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
really
is
a
--
really
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
didn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
what's
you're
answer
to
mr.
featherston
of
this
question,
what
banker
or
what
lender
in
his
right
mind
would
ever
lend
a
dollar
to
an
operating
trustee
under
chapter
x
or
chapter
xi
situation
if
all
that
has
to
happen
was
a
bankruptcy
to
intervene
and
can
have
a
--
and
he
would
never
reflect
another
dollar
of
interest,
who
would
ever
done
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you've
been
saying
is
that
--
or
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
you're
just
not
going
to
have
chapter
--
effective
chapter
x
and
chapter
xi
borrowing
that
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
doesn't
solve
the
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
giving
collateral
doesn't
solve
the
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
on
the
list,
it's
on
the
other.
i
don't
--
now
talking
about
his
principal.
i'm
talking
about
if
he'd
be
able
to
earn
something
from
his
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
court
approval
of
a
--
of
any
of
these
transactions
wouldn't
be
an
answer
to
you
--
wouldn't
give
you
any
answer
of
--
that's
all
you
have
to
have
you
move
this
case.
