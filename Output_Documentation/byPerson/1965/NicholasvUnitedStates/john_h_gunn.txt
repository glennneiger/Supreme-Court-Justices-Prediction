mr.
john
h.
gunn
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
honorable
court.
the
importance
of
the
matter
that
we
have
before
you
today
is
reflected
by
an
analysis
in
the
government's
brief
with
which
we
hardly
concur
showing
the
increase
nationally
in
debtor's
relief
proceedings.
now,
the
government
also
points
out
that
in,
what
i
compute
to
be
about
60%
of
those
instances,
we're
referring
to
the
chapter
xi
analysis,
the
arrangement
proceedings.
the
proceeding
results
or
the
proceeding
has
failed
and
there
is
a
resulting
adjudication
in
bankruptcy
with
the
replacement
by
the
debtor
of
a
creditors
and
the
trustee.
the
question,
therefore,
of
the
case
at
hand
is
to
what
extent
is
the
trustee
or
stated
even
more
directly,
to
what
extent
is
the
general
estate
responsible
for
income
taxes
withholding
taxes
that
is
to
say
and
other
taxes,
federal
taxes
which
have
been
collected
by
the
debtor
in
possession
dissipated
prior
to
the
adjudication
not
handed
over
to
the
creditor's
representative.
and
must
the
trustee
respond
on
a
claim
and
pay
interest
on
those
funds
which
he
did
not
receive
as
well
as
paying
the
principal
of
the
funds
which
we
concede.
and
is
he
subject
to
penalties
if
he
fails
to
return?
those
are
the
problems
of
with
which
we're
faced
today.
problem
receives
a
little
added
emphasis
from
the
fact
that
in
1952,
presumably
because
of
this
increase
in
debtor's
reli
--
debtors
relief
provisions
and
compositions
of
creditors,
congress
changed
section
64
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
and
in
changing
it,
they
subordinated
the
costs
and
expenses
of
the
abortive
debtor's
relief
provision
to
those
of
the
liquidating
bankruptcy.
when
the
debtor
was
taken
out
after
adjudication
and
the
creditor's
representative,
the
trustee
replaced
him.
and
in
essence,
these
are
the
facts
of
the
case
of
john
nicholas
versus
the
united
states
that
were
before
your
honors
on
today
decided
coincidentally
only
ten
days
apart
from
an
opposite
decision
on
a
virtually
the
same
set
of
facts
in
the
eighth
circuit.
in
this
case
there
was
a
voluntary
petition
by
a
motel
in
miami
for
an
arrangement
with
its
unsecured
creditors.
for
40
days
under
court
order,
this
debtor
in
possession
managed
its
affairs.
and
then
on
a
petition
drawn
by
creditors,
it
was
adjudicated
as
its
plan
could
not
succeed.
it
had
in
fact
been
dispossessed
of
the
hotel
premises.
and
a
trustee
was
elected.
the
government
filed
its
tax
claims
subsequently.
they
claimed
not
only
pre-petitioned
interest
or
pre-petitioned
taxes.
they
claimed
as
well
certain
taxes
which
had
been
withheld,
had
been
collected
as
cabaret
taxes
and
as
unemployment
and
social
security
taxes
by
the
debtor
in
possession
but
never
handed
over
to
the
trustee.
and
presumably,
used
in
the
operations
of
the
business
or
otherwise
dissipated.
accordingly,
when
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
took
over
as
the
record
shows,
he
received
nothing
in
the
way
of
transferred
assets.
he
subsequently
was
able
by
certain
proceedings
to
gather
together
in
the
state.
and
now
the
government
in
its
tax
claim
as
the
principal
of
these
taxes,
as
to
assess
the
interest
to
the
date
that
it
filed
its
claim,
as
accrued
interest
thereafter
up
until
the
date
of
payment,
and
as
to
penalties
against
this
trustee
for
his
failure
to
make
returns
as
to
the
debtor
in
possession's
tax
collection.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
no
sir.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
the
point
that
i
first
made,
this
is
a
fight
between
the
general
state
and
the
united
states
rather
than
the
trustee
and
the
united
states.
now
sir,
our
briefs
i
believe
contained
more
history
than
we
can
cover
in
on
your
summary
calendar.
they
point
out
that
for
about
150
years
under
the
english
bankruptcy
practice;
there
was
a
firm
rule
that
there
would
be
no
grant
of
post-petition
interest.
that
in
1911,
justice
holmes
recognized
that
in
sexton
versus
dreyfus
and
those
cases
are
set
out.
that
there
was
some
confusion
in
the
lower
cases
which
we've
discussed,
which
the
government
has
cited.
but
that,
the
principal
of
no
post-petition
interest
was
memorialized
as
the
word
we
used
in
the
saper
decision
in
1949
where
this
court
said
that
for
a
variety
of
reasons
spelled
out
in
that
decision,
they
were
not
going
to
allow
on
award
of
post-petition
interest
on
pre-petition
tax
obligations.
we
believe
that
the
reasons
for
the
denial
of
this
post-petition
interest
may
merit
the
court's
attention
for
a
few
moments
because
we
believe
they
are
as
applicable
in
the
situation
at
hand
as
they
are
in
the
situation
where
the
government
taxes
are
not
incurred
by
debtor
in
possession
but
were
incurred
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
arrangement
petition.
we
take
strong
issue
with
the
government
on
this
point.
first
place,
these
decisions
say
that
delay
of
distribution
in
bankruptcy
is
an
act
of
law.
it's
not
attributable
to
the
fault
of
a
court
officer
if
there's
a
delay
in
distribution
to
the
government
of
its
claim
that
these
delays
occur
as
necessary
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
they
say
further
that
for
the
very
practical
reason,
we
must
have
a
cut-off
date.
there's
an
1893
decision
by
this
court,
the
thomas
case
cited
in
our
brief
where
it
says
that
the
cut-off
date
as
to
interest
is
a
necessary
incident
to
the
settlement
of
estates.
at
some
point,
we
must
stop,
compute
all
the
obligations
and
pay
them.
now
obviously,
and
for
a
third
reason,
if
the
obligations
bear
different
rates
of
interest,
it's
unfair
to
let
that
interest
accumulate
after
the
petitioner's
file.
it's
unfair
to
the
creditors
whose
claims
bear
a
smaller
rate
of
interest
contractually.
if
they
do
not
bear
a
rate
of
interest
but
you
award
a
rate
of
interest
under
some
statute
as
the
government
here
appraised
then
the
fellow
who
suffers
is
the
general
creditor
who
finds
that
where
he
thought
he
had
some
dividend,
where
he
thought
he'd
received
some
return
on
the
money
he's
lost,
in
fact
he
receives
nothing
because
that
money
is
consumed
in
post-petition
interest
paid
the
government.
we
do
not
believe
either
the
government
or
the
entire
class
of
creditors
of
which
the
government
is
only
one
party
should
receive
that
advantage
over
the
unsecured
creditors,
and
indeed
justice
black,
in
the
vanston
bondholders
case
which
we've
quoted
at
some
length
at
various
places
on
our
brief
says
that
interest
itself
is
a
penalty
on
creditors.
and
it's
a
penalty
we
submit
to
the
court
without
any
fault
on
the
creditor's
part.
they
suffered
the
burden
as
the
question
has
just
indicated,
not
the
trustee
from
this
delay.
and
then
alluding
again
to
the
saper
case,
the
1949
decision
which
must
constitute
the
backbone
of
my
argument
to
your
honors
today,
the
saper
case
pointed
out
that
the
bankruptcy
act
sought
to
equate
the
government
as
a
participant
in
bankruptcy
proceedings
with
other
creditors
in
the
bankruptcy
proceedings.
that
since
the
government
was
a
party
to
them,
the
government
must
abide
by
the
same
rules
and
i
submit
that
the
government,
since
your
honors'
pronouncement
on
the
spears
case,
i
believe
to
be
a
warning
that
the
government
must
protect
itself
and
avail
itself
from
the
statutory
procedures
at
its
command.
and
i
hope
by
the
time
i
reserve
for
closing,
i
can
emphasize
that
point
again
if
it
requires
emphasis.
at
any
rate
the
saper
case
said
that
tax
claims
were
the
same
as
other
claims
and
that
there
was
a
pattern
of
distribution
prescribed
by
the
bankruptcy
act
that
that
pattern
of
distribution
should
not
be
varied
by
other
federal
legislation
in
other
fields.
where
there
was
a
tendency
in
all
the
cases
as
we
have
cited
them,
a
great
many
of
the
cases
to
find
independent
internal
revenue
regulations
and
to
try
to
give
those
equality
with
or
priority
over
a
bankruptcy
petition
or
bankruptcy
act
provision.
now,
we
submit
to
your
honors
that
since
the
saper
case
which
did
set
up
the
rule
that
there'd
be
no
post-petition
interest,
there
has
been
a
constant
effort
on
the
part
of
secured
creditors
and
the
government
to
emasculate
the
saper
rule,
to
try
to
carve
out
exceptions
to
it
which
should
have
the
effect
of
eating
it
up
without
belaboring
those
points,
they're
treated
in
the
brief,
but
they're
the
type
of
situations
where
the
estate
proves
to
be
solved
then
obviously
interest
should
be
given,
the
situation
where
the
security
itself
produces
substantial
income.
then
in
that
situation,
the
creditor
who
has
that
security
should
receive
its
benefit
because
the
unsecured
creditor
behind
him
suffers
no
loss.
we
believe
that
each
of
those
arguments
is
equally
applicable
here
where
the
interest
that
is
sought
is
against
the
general
estate
because
of
the
failure
of
the
debtor,
its
antagonist,
we
submit,
to
withhold
the
monies
or
return
over
the
monies
that
it
was
required
by
statute
to
withhold
and
account
for.
we
believe
that
the
government
in
the
case
at
hand
and
were
successful
before
the
fifth
circuit
is
attempting
to
create
an
exception
in
which
it
visits
the
vicarious
liability
on
an
innocent
party,
the
unsecured
creditor
that
stands
behind
the
government
or
the
tax
creditor
who
stands
in
the
same
--
on
the
same
plane
with
the
government.
and
we
believe
that
the
government
by
attempting
to
create
a
vicarious
liability
on
that
trustee
which
is
the
door
into
the
general
estate
threatens
to
secure
to
itself
an
unwanted
advantage,
an
advantage
that
it
does
not
need
if
it
tends
to
its
own
bankruptcy
affairs.
and
that
by
doing
so,
it
threatens
seriously
the
whole
fabric
of
bankruptcy
administration;
a
fabric
which
the
saper
case
says
provides
an
orderly
rule
of
administration
which
should
not
be
ordered
because
of
internal
revenue
statutes
which
might
be
held.
and
we
must
say
to
your
honors,
we
find
nothing
that
would
directly
conflict
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
sir,
i
--
what
principal?
mr.
john
h.
gunn
well,
we
concede
the
principal
of
the
tax
because
we
believe
that
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
because
sir
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
because
that
bankruptcy
statute
requires
it
sir.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
section
64(a)
in
setting
up
the
first
priority
says
there
should
be
first
paid
out
of
bankruptcy
estates,
the
costs
and
expenses
of
administration.
the
1952
amendment
recognizing
that
we
had
a
case
--
that
we
could
have
a
case
in
which
the
debtor
relief
action
would
use
up
all
the
costs
and
expenses
of
administration,
there
wouldn't
be
any
funds
available
for
anyone
who
administered
a
liquidating
bankruptcy
subordinated
the
costs
and
expenses
of
the
abortive
debtor
relief
position
to
those
of
the
succeeding
liquidating
bankruptcy,
so
i'm
conceding
only
what
congress
has
prescribed
in
the
statute.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
no
sir.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
no
sir,
i
think
the
word
there
is
his.
i
can
see
that
he
must
pay
as
an
expense
of
administration,
as
a
post-petition
administration
expense.
he
must
pay
the
principal
of
the
taxes
incurred
by
the
debtor
in
possession.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
that's
right
sir
because
they
occur
after
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
yes
sir,
i
think
either
case
he
has
to
pay
the
principal.our
basic
argument
is
the
interest
which
is
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
because
after
the
election
of
the
trustee,
the
continuing
interest
to
the
date
of
payment
and
the
penalties
against
the
trustee
for
not
returning
it.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
no
sir.
i'll
deal
with
that
in
just
a
moment
when
i
get
to
the
question
of
penalties.i
too
very
strongly
didn't
know
sir.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
no
sir,
he
never
had
an
obligation
to
pay
the
tax
until
he
(voice
overlap)
until
all
the
expenses
--
until
we
knew
where
all
the
expenses
of
administration
were.
i
think
he
fell
in
the
trap
that
your
honor
has
discerned
quite
clearly
in
the
king
case.
he's
paying
subordinated
taxes
under
60
--
he's
being
asked
to
pay
subordinated
taxes
under
section
64(a)
before
he
pays
those
which
the
statute
says
are
prior
thereto.
i
think
if
he
did
do
that,
he
might
find
himself
in
the
same
situation
as
mr.
king,
the
trustee
in
the
case
that
i
just
mentioned
your
honor,
which
is
in
the
briefs
before
your
honor
and
which
held
him
responsible
for
failing
to
pay
the
government
and
when
he
had
paid
subordinate
creditors.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
well,
i
think
sir
that
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
i
believe
it
might
well
be
argued.
i
think
--
you
mean
what
requires
the
immediate
payment?
mr.
john
h.
gunn
section
64(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
sir.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
it
says
that
--
it's
under
decisions
understated
that
any
expenses
incurred
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
it
was
--
it
was
incurred
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
for
the
arrangement
which
is
the
petition
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
yes
sir,
for
purposes
of
paying
those
subordinated
administrative
point.
what
my
argument
sir
and
we
have
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
insofar
as
the
assets
are
sufficient
to
pay
them
after
the
payment
of
the
expenses
in
the
liquidating
bankruptcy,
justice
white.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
well
sir,
i'm
saying
that
since
1952,
when
this
act
was
amended,
it
is
our
position
that
there
are
three
classes
of
creditors
rather
than
two
with
whom
we're
dealing
this
afternoon
because
we're
not
talking
about
wage
claims
or
any
of
the
other
classes.
we're
saying
that
those
claims
which
arise
prior
to
a
petition
of
any
sort
for
relief
under
the
bankruptcy
act
whether
it'd
be
liquidation,
reorganization,
or
arrangement,
are
entitled
to
certain
estates.
they're
entitled
to
be
paid
under
the
fourth
priority
under
section
64.
but
insofar
as
other
taxes
are
incurred
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
where
federal
jurisdiction
attach
any
petition
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
that's
right
sir.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
because
of
the
relation
back
part
of
section
378
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
they
are
administrative
expenses.
the
question
is,
since
1952
and
we
believe
the
government
overlooked
in
this
situation
and
the
fifth
circuit
overlooked
it
back
that
there
are
two
--
there
are
priority
--
there
are
two
priorities
within
section
64(a),
a
priority
within
a
priority
as
it
were
by
statute.
and
that
is,
one,
the
liq
--
the
expenses
of
the
liquidating
bankruptcy
which
comes
first
and
this
is
unequivocally
set
out.
and
secondly,
insofar
as
there's
money
left,
then
the
administrative
expenses
of
the
abortive
arrangement
preceding
the
adjudication,
preceding
the
liquidating
bankruptcy
are
paid.
now,
our
position
simply
is
this.
we
talk
about
this
being
an
obligation
of
the
trustee
but
as
your
honors
have
discerned
from
this
question,
it
isn't
an
attempt
to
fix
this
on
the
trustee.
this
is
an
attempt
to
fix
this
on
the
general
estate
and
subordinate
general
creditors
take
dividends
away
from
them
to
pay
the
government
a
tax
claim
that's
running.
and
a
tax
claim
that's
running
during
a
period
of
time
when
the
cases
have
all
said,
tax
claims
cannot
run
because
it's
necessary
to
put
a
cut-off
date
to
stop
--
stop
all
obligations
running
so
we
can
(voice

distribution.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
sir,
with
that
i
have
no
dispute
and
i
do
not
dispute
you
--
that
with
you
here
this
afternoon
nor
do
i
dispute
that
with
the
government
this
afternoon.
i
think
the
interest
right
up
until
the
date
of
adjudication
should
be
paid.
our
complaint
is
against
interest
after
the
date
of
adjudication,
interest
after
the
election
of
the
trustee,
and
penalties
against
this
trustee
for
his
failure
to
report.
now,
in
this
general
connection,
the
government
has,
in
our
judgment,
ignored
the
three-time
periods
that
i've
told
your
honor
about
which
are
respectively
pre-adjudication
that
that
is
--
forgive
me
--
pre-petition
and
then
post-petition
but
pre-adjudication
and
then
liquidating
bankruptcy.
they
have
ignored
that
and
they
have
been
in
effect
said
everything
must
be
pre-petitioned
or
it
must
be
post-petitioned.
and
we
say
to
your
honors
simply
that
this
is
not
the
case.
we
believe
that
this
is
the
basis
of
the
fifth
circuit's
decision.
we
believe
it
to
be
in
serious
error
because
we
believe
that
the
effect
of
this
is
to
put
--
to
face
a
trustee
in
a
liquidating
bankruptcy
within
an
insoluble
dilemma.
the
first
thing,
he
must
stop
now
when
the
government's
claim
is
filed
and
he
must
pay
it.
and
if
he
pays
it,
without
ascertaining
that
they
are
liquidating
bankruptcy
expenses,
he's
subject
to
the
surcharge
we've
mentioned.
if
he
fails
to
pass
and
delays
paying
it,
he
pays
interest
which
comes
out
of
the
pocket
of
his
general
estate.
now,
let
me
say
with
respect
to
the
penalties
that
your
honors
have
asked
about.
in
the
first
place,
i
consider
and
i
believe
that
there
were
several
decisions
of
this
court
which
say
that
interest
is
itself
a
penalty.
the
trustee
has
been
penalized
because
he
did
not
return
these
taxes.
we
find
the
only
obligation
in
the
statutes
for
our
trustee
to
make
a
tax
return
to
relate
to
income
taxes.
we
do
not
find
any
statutory
duty
for
him
to
return
any
taxes
on
behalf
of
this
defaulting
debtor
in
possession
who
is,
we
submit
to
your
honors,
a
violent
antagonist
of
the
creditor's
man
of
trustee.
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
creditor
should
be
visited
in
this
particular
case
with
these
defalcations.
we
find
that
the
only
case
which
the
government
seems
to
rely
on
is
the
boteler
case,
a
decision
of
this
case.
but
we
find
that
the
boteler
case
simply
took
a
trustee
who
hadn't
himself
paid
some
california
estate
taxes
on
his
own
operation.
and
because
he
didn't
pay
them,
they
penalized
him.
but
this
is
not
our
case.
the
government
seeks
to
penalize
our
general
estate,
our
trustee
for
the
shortcomings
of
his
predecessor,
debtor
in
possession.
this,
we
submit,
cannot
be
done.
we
further
submit
that
the
government's
other
basis
for
this
is
judicial
code
section
960
set
out
in
the
briefs
and
that
particular
section
says
only
that
an
operating
trustee
must
pay
federal
and
estate
taxes.
i
have
held
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
sir,
i'll
be
very
brief.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
trustee
could
safely
pay
the
money
on
the
administrative
long
that
had
been
made
with
the
debtor
in
possession
period.
i
do
not
believe
that
in
the
conventional
situation
absent
some
untested
expressed
priority
increasing
language,
the
lender
in
a
debtor
in
possession
situation
can
consider
himself
protected
on
parity
with
liquidating
creditors
in
the
liquidating
bankruptcy.
further,
i
say
to
mr.
justice
white
who
i
believe
asked
the
question
on
mr.
featherston
whether
or
not
a
turnover
order
could
have
been
brought
and
a
proof
of
claim
framed
along
the
line
of
this
were
trust
fund
to
have
the
funds
turned
over.
mr.
featherston's
answer,
as
i
recall
it,
was
that
it
may
very
well
have
been
possible
that
there
was
no
money
there
at
that
time.
and
i
think
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
record
you
will
see
that
the
government
claim
was
filed
in
1963
and
that
from
1961
on
the
trustee
had
in
his
possession
the
$8,842.13
that
mr.
featherston
spoke
to
your
honors
about.
that's
at
page
18.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
none
sir,
i
believe
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
no
sir.
and
i'm
going
to
say
so
that
i
have
advised
lenders
who
have
done
so
with
disasters
consequences.
i
would
not
do
it.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
no
sir,
i
believe
it
can
be
done
in
one
of
two
ways.
and
i
certainly
(voice
overlap)
it's
even
the
point
at
hand.
it
can
be
done
by
a
collateralizing
instrument
with
the
court
approving
and
so
that
the
creditor
has
security
to
face
the
liquidating
bankruptcy.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
well
sir
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
they
will
safeguard
him
on
his
principal.
and
i
have
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
i
doubt
seriously
that
there
is
an
effective
way
to
do
it.
secondly,
i
will
say
to
your
honor
that
--
i
understand
a
little
bit
quite
clear
that
these
loans,
these
pre
--
this
debtor
possession
loans
must
be
confirmed,
must
be
covered
and
approved
in
the
order
of
confirmation
to
enable
them
to
stand
up
in
subsequent
proceedings.
i
believe
the
bankruptcy
act
were
firmly
ample.
that
is
not
in
the
briefs
either.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
no
sir,
i
don't
say
that.
i
say
that
this
man
is
not
--
i'm
apprehensive
that
this
man
jeopardizes
the
loan
itself
in
a
debtor
in
possession
situation
because
he
can
only
recover
back
in
aliquot
portion
of
what
remained
after
the
liquidating
bankruptcy
expenses
are
paid.
i
say
the
very
loan
itself
is
peerless.
then
i
say
that
interest
is
a
matter
of
second
regard
there.
and
yes
indeed,
i
believe
that
unless
there's
a
court
order
collateralizing
this
man
and
certainly
assuring
that
if
he's
interested
up
until
the
date
of
adjudication
or
confirmation
whichever
occurs
and
after
working
the
case
of
confirmation,
that
the
loan
is
very
risky.
now,
may
i
say
so
that
i
didn't
believe
that
the
trust
fund
argument
was
going
to
come
up
because
i
understood
the
government
to
say
that
they
were
abandoning.
clearly,
the
trust
fund
argument
has
no
application
or
whatsoever
to
interest
collection.
and
it
has
no
application
whatsoever
to
penalty
funds.
and
i
don't
think
if
there's
no
raise
involved
or
if
the
raise
has
been
dissipated,
that
there's
any
possibility
of
it
applying
to
the
situations
that
we're
concerned
with
here.
i
want
--
but
my
last
point
to
say
that
the
boteler
case
clearly
involves
the
case
where
the
trustee
himself
operated
the
vehicles
on
the
highway
of
california.
it
did
not
involve
a
situation
where
the
trustee
had
to
respond
for
the
debtor
in
possessions
operating
the
vehicles
on
the
california
highways.
i
think
in
fact
this
california
statute
has
contrasted
with
the
federal
statute
makes
no
difference.
now
lastly,
may
i
say
that
it
is
my
hope
or
our
hope
in
presenting
this
case
that
we
can
encourage
the
government
which
is
deriving
considerable
revenue
from
bankruptcy
situations
to
be
in
and
to
start
in
this
situation
so
that
they
are
participants
when
the
question
of
loans
or
advances
or
payments
on
tax
accounts
can
be
made
so
that
they
can
ask
the
referee
to
compel
the
trust
--
to
compel
the
debtor
in
possession
to
post
an
adequate
indemnity
bond
to
prevent
just
what
has
occurred
here.
they
can
ask
the
trustee
for
payment
and
if
he
refuses
and
there's
money
available
ask
the
referee
for
an
order
directing
his
payments
then
and
seek
the
relief
at
that
time.
i
do
not
believe
the
government
having
great
statutory
privileges
in
this
situation
can
sit
back,
rest
on
their
position,
and
subsequently
seek
to
penalize
the
general
estate.
and
we
submit
to
those
reasons
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
honorable
court.
the
importance
of
the
matter
that
we
have
before
you
today
is
reflected
by
an
analysis
in
the
government's
brief
with
which
we
hardly
concur
showing
the
increase
nationally
in
debtor's
relief
proceedings.
now,
the
government
also
points
out
that
in,
what
i
compute
to
be
about
60%
of
those
instances,
we're
referring
to
the
chapter
xi
analysis,
the
arrangement
proceedings.
the
proceeding
results
or
the
proceeding
has
failed
and
there
is
a
resulting
adjudication
in
bankruptcy
with
the
replacement
by
the
debtor
of
a
creditors
and
the
trustee.
the
question,
therefore,
of
the
case
at
hand
is
to
what
extent
is
the
trustee
or
stated
even
more
directly,
to
what
extent
is
the
general
estate
responsible
for
income
taxes
withholding
taxes
that
is
to
say
and
other
taxes,
federal
taxes
which
have
been
collected
by
the
debtor
in
possession
dissipated
prior
to
the
adjudication
not
handed
over
to
the
creditor's
representative.
and
must
the
trustee
respond
on
a
claim
and
pay
interest
on
those
funds
which
he
did
not
receive
as
well
as
paying
the
principal
of
the
funds
which
we
concede.
and
is
he
subject
to
penalties
if
he
fails
to
return?
those
are
the
problems
of
with
which
we're
faced
today.
problem
receives
a
little
added
emphasis
from
the
fact
that
in
1952,
presumably
because
of
this
increase
in
debtor's
reli
--
debtors
relief
provisions
and
compositions
of
creditors,
congress
changed
section
64
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
and
in
changing
it,
they
subordinated
the
costs
and
expenses
of
the
abortive
debtor's
relief
provision
to
those
of
the
liquidating
bankruptcy.
when
the
debtor
was
taken
out
after
adjudication
and
the
creditor's
representative,
the
trustee
replaced
him.
and
in
essence,
these
are
the
facts
of
the
case
of
john
nicholas
versus
the
united
states
that
were
before
your
honors
on
today
decided
coincidentally
only
ten
days
apart
from
an
opposite
decision
on
a
virtually
the
same
set
of
facts
in
the
eighth
circuit.
in
this
case
there
was
a
voluntary
petition
by
a
motel
in
miami
for
an
arrangement
with
its
unsecured
creditors.
for
40
days
under
court
order,
this
debtor
in
possession
managed
its
affairs.
and
then
on
a
petition
drawn
by
creditors,
it
was
adjudicated
as
its
plan
could
not
succeed.
it
had
in
fact
been
dispossessed
of
the
hotel
premises.
and
a
trustee
was
elected.
the
government
filed
its
tax
claims
subsequently.
they
claimed
not
only
pre-petitioned
interest
or
pre-petitioned
taxes.
they
claimed
as
well
certain
taxes
which
had
been
withheld,
had
been
collected
as
cabaret
taxes
and
as
unemployment
and
social
security
taxes
by
the
debtor
in
possession
but
never
handed
over
to
the
trustee.
and
presumably,
used
in
the
operations
of
the
business
or
otherwise
dissipated.
accordingly,
when
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
took
over
as
the
record
shows,
he
received
nothing
in
the
way
of
transferred
assets.
he
subsequently
was
able
by
certain
proceedings
to
gather
together
in
the
state.
and
now
the
government
in
its
tax
claim
as
the
principal
of
these
taxes,
as
to
assess
the
interest
to
the
date
that
it
filed
its
claim,
as
accrued
interest
thereafter
up
until
the
date
of
payment,
and
as
to
penalties
against
this
trustee
for
his
failure
to
make
returns
as
to
the
debtor
in
possession's
tax
collection.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
no
sir.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
the
point
that
i
first
made,
this
is
a
fight
between
the
general
state
and
the
united
states
rather
than
the
trustee
and
the
united
states.
now
sir,
our
briefs
i
believe
contained
more
history
than
we
can
cover
in
on
your
summary
calendar.
they
point
out
that
for
about
150
years
under
the
english
bankruptcy
practice;
there
was
a
firm
rule
that
there
would
be
no
grant
of
post-petition
interest.
that
in
1911,
justice
holmes
recognized
that
in
sexton
versus
dreyfus
and
those
cases
are
set
out.
that
there
was
some
confusion
in
the
lower
cases
which
we've
discussed,
which
the
government
has
cited.
but
that,
the
principal
of
no
post-petition
interest
was
memorialized
as
the
word
we
used
in
the
saper
decision
in
1949
where
this
court
said
that
for
a
variety
of
reasons
spelled
out
in
that
decision,
they
were
not
going
to
allow
on
award
of
post-petition
interest
on
pre-petition
tax
obligations.
we
believe
that
the
reasons
for
the
denial
of
this
post-petition
interest
may
merit
the
court's
attention
for
a
few
moments
because
we
believe
they
are
as
applicable
in
the
situation
at
hand
as
they
are
in
the
situation
where
the
government
taxes
are
not
incurred
by
debtor
in
possession
but
were
incurred
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
arrangement
petition.
we
take
strong
issue
with
the
government
on
this
point.
first
place,
these
decisions
say
that
delay
of
distribution
in
bankruptcy
is
an
act
of
law.
it's
not
attributable
to
the
fault
of
a
court
officer
if
there's
a
delay
in
distribution
to
the
government
of
its
claim
that
these
delays
occur
as
necessary
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
they
say
further
that
for
the
very
practical
reason,
we
must
have
a
cut-off
date.
there's
an
1893
decision
by
this
court,
the
thomas
case
cited
in
our
brief
where
it
says
that
the
cut-off
date
as
to
interest
is
a
necessary
incident
to
the
settlement
of
estates.
at
some
point,
we
must
stop,
compute
all
the
obligations
and
pay
them.
now
obviously,
and
for
a
third
reason,
if
the
obligations
bear
different
rates
of
interest,
it's
unfair
to
let
that
interest
accumulate
after
the
petitioner's
file.
it's
unfair
to
the
creditors
whose
claims
bear
a
smaller
rate
of
interest
contractually.
if
they
do
not
bear
a
rate
of
interest
but
you
award
a
rate
of
interest
under
some
statute
as
the
government
here
appraised
then
the
fellow
who
suffers
is
the
general
creditor
who
finds
that
where
he
thought
he
had
some
dividend,
where
he
thought
he'd
received
some
return
on
the
money
he's
lost,
in
fact
he
receives
nothing
because
that
money
is
consumed
in
post-petition
interest
paid
the
government.
we
do
not
believe
either
the
government
or
the
entire
class
of
creditors
of
which
the
government
is
only
one
party
should
receive
that
advantage
over
the
unsecured
creditors,
and
indeed
justice
black,
in
the
vanston
bondholders
case
which
we've
quoted
at
some
length
at
various
places
on
our
brief
says
that
interest
itself
is
a
penalty
on
creditors.
and
it's
a
penalty
we
submit
to
the
court
without
any
fault
on
the
creditor's
part.
they
suffered
the
burden
as
the
question
has
just
indicated,
not
the
trustee
from
this
delay.
and
then
alluding
again
to
the
saper
case,
the
1949
decision
which
must
constitute
the
backbone
of
my
argument
to
your
honors
today,
the
saper
case
pointed
out
that
the
bankruptcy
act
sought
to
equate
the
government
as
a
participant
in
bankruptcy
proceedings
with
other
creditors
in
the
bankruptcy
proceedings.
that
since
the
government
was
a
party
to
them,
the
government
must
abide
by
the
same
rules
and
i
submit
that
the
government,
since
your
honors'
pronouncement
on
the
spears
case,
i
believe
to
be
a
warning
that
the
government
must
protect
itself
and
avail
itself
from
the
statutory
procedures
at
its
command.
and
i
hope
by
the
time
i
reserve
for
closing,
i
can
emphasize
that
point
again
if
it
requires
emphasis.
at
any
rate
the
saper
case
said
that
tax
claims
were
the
same
as
other
claims
and
that
there
was
a
pattern
of
distribution
prescribed
by
the
bankruptcy
act
that
that
pattern
of
distribution
should
not
be
varied
by
other
federal
legislation
in
other
fields.
where
there
was
a
tendency
in
all
the
cases
as
we
have
cited
them,
a
great
many
of
the
cases
to
find
independent
internal
revenue
regulations
and
to
try
to
give
those
equality
with
or
priority
over
a
bankruptcy
petition
or
bankruptcy
act
provision.
now,
we
submit
to
your
honors
that
since
the
saper
case
which
did
set
up
the
rule
that
there'd
be
no
post-petition
interest,
there
has
been
a
constant
effort
on
the
part
of
secured
creditors
and
the
government
to
emasculate
the
saper
rule,
to
try
to
carve
out
exceptions
to
it
which
should
have
the
effect
of
eating
it
up
without
belaboring
those
points,
they're
treated
in
the
brief,
but
they're
the
type
of
situations
where
the
estate
proves
to
be
solved
then
obviously
interest
should
be
given,
the
situation
where
the
security
itself
produces
substantial
income.
then
in
that
situation,
the
creditor
who
has
that
security
should
receive
its
benefit
because
the
unsecured
creditor
behind
him
suffers
no
loss.
we
believe
that
each
of
those
arguments
is
equally
applicable
here
where
the
interest
that
is
sought
is
against
the
general
estate
because
of
the
failure
of
the
debtor,
its
antagonist,
we
submit,
to
withhold
the
monies
or
return
over
the
monies
that
it
was
required
by
statute
to
withhold
and
account
for.
we
believe
that
the
government
in
the
case
at
hand
and
were
successful
before
the
fifth
circuit
is
attempting
to
create
an
exception
in
which
it
visits
the
vicarious
liability
on
an
innocent
party,
the
unsecured
creditor
that
stands
behind
the
government
or
the
tax
creditor
who
stands
in
the
same
--
on
the
same
plane
with
the
government.
and
we
believe
that
the
government
by
attempting
to
create
a
vicarious
liability
on
that
trustee
which
is
the
door
into
the
general
estate
threatens
to
secure
to
itself
an
unwanted
advantage,
an
advantage
that
it
does
not
need
if
it
tends
to
its
own
bankruptcy
affairs.
and
that
by
doing
so,
it
threatens
seriously
the
whole
fabric
of
bankruptcy
administration;
a
fabric
which
the
saper
case
says
provides
an
orderly
rule
of
administration
which
should
not
be
ordered
because
of
internal
revenue
statutes
which
might
be
held.
and
we
must
say
to
your
honors,
we
find
nothing
that
would
directly
conflict
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
sir,
i
--
what
principal?
mr.
john
h.
gunn
well,
we
concede
the
principal
of
the
tax
because
we
believe
that
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
because
sir
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
because
that
bankruptcy
statute
requires
it
sir.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
section
64(a)
in
setting
up
the
first
priority
says
there
should
be
first
paid
out
of
bankruptcy
estates,
the
costs
and
expenses
of
administration.
the
1952
amendment
recognizing
that
we
had
a
case
--
that
we
could
have
a
case
in
which
the
debtor
relief
action
would
use
up
all
the
costs
and
expenses
of
administration,
there
wouldn't
be
any
funds
available
for
anyone
who
administered
a
liquidating
bankruptcy
subordinated
the
costs
and
expenses
of
the
abortive
debtor
relief
position
to
those
of
the
succeeding
liquidating
bankruptcy,
so
i'm
conceding
only
what
congress
has
prescribed
in
the
statute.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
no
sir.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
no
sir,
i
think
the
word
there
is
his.
i
can
see
that
he
must
pay
as
an
expense
of
administration,
as
a
post-petition
administration
expense.
he
must
pay
the
principal
of
the
taxes
incurred
by
the
debtor
in
possession.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
that's
right
sir
because
they
occur
after
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
yes
sir,
i
think
either
case
he
has
to
pay
the
principal.our
basic
argument
is
the
interest
which
is
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
because
after
the
election
of
the
trustee,
the
continuing
interest
to
the
date
of
payment
and
the
penalties
against
the
trustee
for
not
returning
it.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
no
sir.
i'll
deal
with
that
in
just
a
moment
when
i
get
to
the
question
of
penalties.i
too
very
strongly
didn't
know
sir.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
no
sir,
he
never
had
an
obligation
to
pay
the
tax
until
he
(voice
overlap)
until
all
the
expenses
--
until
we
knew
where
all
the
expenses
of
administration
were.
i
think
he
fell
in
the
trap
that
your
honor
has
discerned
quite
clearly
in
the
king
case.
he's
paying
subordinated
taxes
under
60
--
he's
being
asked
to
pay
subordinated
taxes
under
section
64(a)
before
he
pays
those
which
the
statute
says
are
prior
thereto.
i
think
if
he
did
do
that,
he
might
find
himself
in
the
same
situation
as
mr.
king,
the
trustee
in
the
case
that
i
just
mentioned
your
honor,
which
is
in
the
briefs
before
your
honor
and
which
held
him
responsible
for
failing
to
pay
the
government
and
when
he
had
paid
subordinate
creditors.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
well,
i
think
sir
that
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
i
believe
it
might
well
be
argued.
i
think
--
you
mean
what
requires
the
immediate
payment?
mr.
john
h.
gunn
section
64(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
sir.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
it
says
that
--
it's
under
decisions
understated
that
any
expenses
incurred
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
it
was
--
it
was
incurred
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
for
the
arrangement
which
is
the
petition
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
yes
sir,
for
purposes
of
paying
those
subordinated
administrative
point.
what
my
argument
sir
and
we
have
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
insofar
as
the
assets
are
sufficient
to
pay
them
after
the
payment
of
the
expenses
in
the
liquidating
bankruptcy,
justice
white.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
well
sir,
i'm
saying
that
since
1952,
when
this
act
was
amended,
it
is
our
position
that
there
are
three
classes
of
creditors
rather
than
two
with
whom
we're
dealing
this
afternoon
because
we're
not
talking
about
wage
claims
or
any
of
the
other
classes.
we're
saying
that
those
claims
which
arise
prior
to
a
petition
of
any
sort
for
relief
under
the
bankruptcy
act
whether
it'd
be
liquidation,
reorganization,
or
arrangement,
are
entitled
to
certain
estates.
they're
entitled
to
be
paid
under
the
fourth
priority
under
section
64.
but
insofar
as
other
taxes
are
incurred
subsequent
to
the
filing
of
the
petition
where
federal
jurisdiction
attach
any
petition
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
that's
right
sir.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
because
of
the
relation
back
part
of
section
378
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
they
are
administrative
expenses.
the
question
is,
since
1952
and
we
believe
the
government
overlooked
in
this
situation
and
the
fifth
circuit
overlooked
it
back
that
there
are
two
--
there
are
priority
--
there
are
two
priorities
within
section
64(a),
a
priority
within
a
priority
as
it
were
by
statute.
and
that
is,
one,
the
liq
--
the
expenses
of
the
liquidating
bankruptcy
which
comes
first
and
this
is
unequivocally
set
out.
and
secondly,
insofar
as
there's
money
left,
then
the
administrative
expenses
of
the
abortive
arrangement
preceding
the
adjudication,
preceding
the
liquidating
bankruptcy
are
paid.
now,
our
position
simply
is
this.
we
talk
about
this
being
an
obligation
of
the
trustee
but
as
your
honors
have
discerned
from
this
question,
it
isn't
an
attempt
to
fix
this
on
the
trustee.
this
is
an
attempt
to
fix
this
on
the
general
estate
and
subordinate
general
creditors
take
dividends
away
from
them
to
pay
the
government
a
tax
claim
that's
running.
and
a
tax
claim
that's
running
during
a
period
of
time
when
the
cases
have
all
said,
tax
claims
cannot
run
because
it's
necessary
to
put
a
cut-off
date
to
stop
--
stop
all
obligations
running
so
we
can
(voice
overlap)
distribution.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
sir,
with
that
i
have
no
dispute
and
i
do
not
dispute
you
--
that
with
you
here
this
afternoon
nor
do
i
dispute
that
with
the
government
this
afternoon.
i
think
the
interest
right
up
until
the
date
of
adjudication
should
be
paid.
our
complaint
is
against
interest
after
the
date
of
adjudication,
interest
after
the
election
of
the
trustee,
and
penalties
against
this
trustee
for
his
failure
to
report.
now,
in
this
general
connection,
the
government
has,
in
our
judgment,
ignored
the
three-time
periods
that
i've
told
your
honor
about
which
are
respectively
pre-adjudication
that
that
is
--
forgive
me
--
pre-petition
and
then
post-petition
but
pre-adjudication
and
then
liquidating
bankruptcy.
they
have
ignored
that
and
they
have
been
in
effect
said
everything
must
be
pre-petitioned
or
it
must
be
post-petitioned.
and
we
say
to
your
honors
simply
that
this
is
not
the
case.
we
believe
that
this
is
the
basis
of
the
fifth
circuit's
decision.
we
believe
it
to
be
in
serious
error
because
we
believe
that
the
effect
of
this
is
to
put
--
to
face
a
trustee
in
a
liquidating
bankruptcy
within
an
insoluble
dilemma.
the
first
thing,
he
must
stop
now
when
the
government's
claim
is
filed
and
he
must
pay
it.
and
if
he
pays
it,
without
ascertaining
that
they
are
liquidating
bankruptcy
expenses,
he's
subject
to
the
surcharge
we've
mentioned.
if
he
fails
to
pass
and
delays
paying
it,
he
pays
interest
which
comes
out
of
the
pocket
of
his
general
estate.
now,
let
me
say
with
respect
to
the
penalties
that
your
honors
have
asked
about.
in
the
first
place,
i
consider
and
i
believe
that
there
were
several
decisions
of
this
court
which
say
that
interest
is
itself
a
penalty.
the
trustee
has
been
penalized
because
he
did
not
return
these
taxes.
we
find
the
only
obligation
in
the
statutes
for
our
trustee
to
make
a
tax
return
to
relate
to
income
taxes.
we
do
not
find
any
statutory
duty
for
him
to
return
any
taxes
on
behalf
of
this
defaulting
debtor
in
possession
who
is,
we
submit
to
your
honors,
a
violent
antagonist
of
the
creditor's
man
of
trustee.
and
we
don't
believe
that
the
creditor
should
be
visited
in
this
particular
case
with
these
defalcations.
we
find
that
the
only
case
which
the
government
seems
to
rely
on
is
the
boteler
case,
a
decision
of
this
case.
but
we
find
that
the
boteler
case
simply
took
a
trustee
who
hadn't
himself
paid
some
california
estate
taxes
on
his
own
operation.
and
because
he
didn't
pay
them,
they
penalized
him.
but
this
is
not
our
case.
the
government
seeks
to
penalize
our
general
estate,
our
trustee
for
the
shortcomings
of
his
predecessor,
debtor
in
possession.
this,
we
submit,
cannot
be
done.
we
further
submit
that
the
government's
other
basis
for
this
is
judicial
code
section
960
set
out
in
the
briefs
and
that
particular
section
says
only
that
an
operating
trustee
must
pay
federal
and
estate
taxes.
i
have
held
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
sir,
i'll
be
very
brief.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
trustee
could
safely
pay
the
money
on
the
administrative
long
that
had
been
made
with
the
debtor
in
possession
period.
i
do
not
believe
that
in
the
conventional
situation
absent
some
untested
expressed
priority
increasing
language,
the
lender
in
a
debtor
in
possession
situation
can
consider
himself
protected
on
parity
with
liquidating
creditors
in
the
liquidating
bankruptcy.
further,
i
say
to
mr.
justice
white
who
i
believe
asked
the
question
on
mr.
featherston
whether
or
not
a
turnover
order
could
have
been
brought
and
a
proof
of
claim
framed
along
the
line
of
this
were
trust
fund
to
have
the
funds
turned
over.
mr.
featherston's
answer,
as
i
recall
it,
was
that
it
may
very
well
have
been
possible
that
there
was
no
money
there
at
that
time.
and
i
think
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
record
you
will
see
that
the
government
claim
was
filed
in
1963
and
that
from
1961
on
the
trustee
had
in
his
possession
the
$8,842.13
that
mr.
featherston
spoke
to
your
honors
about.
that's
at
page
18.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
none
sir,
i
believe
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
no
sir.
and
i'm
going
to
say
so
that
i
have
advised
lenders
who
have
done
so
with
disasters
consequences.
i
would
not
do
it.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
no
sir,
i
believe
it
can
be
done
in
one
of
two
ways.
and
i
certainly
(voice
overlap)
it's
even
the
point
at
hand.
it
can
be
done
by
a
collateralizing
instrument
with
the
court
approving
and
so
that
the
creditor
has
security
to
face
the
liquidating
bankruptcy.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
well
sir
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
they
will
safeguard
him
on
his
principal.
and
i
have
--
mr.
john
h.
gunn
i
doubt
seriously
that
there
is
an
effective
way
to
do
it.
secondly,
i
will
say
to
your
honor
that
--
i
understand
a
little
bit
quite
clear
that
these
loans,
these
pre
--
this
debtor
possession
loans
must
be
confirmed,
must
be
covered
and
approved
in
the
order
of
confirmation
to
enable
them
to
stand
up
in
subsequent
proceedings.
i
believe
the
bankruptcy
act
were
firmly
ample.
that
is
not
in
the
briefs
either.
mr.
john
h.
gunn
no
sir,
i
don't
say
that.
i
say
that
this
man
is
not
--
i'm
apprehensive
that
this
man
jeopardizes
the
loan
itself
in
a
debtor
in
possession
situation
because
he
can
only
recover
back
in
aliquot
portion
of
what
remained
after
the
liquidating
bankruptcy
expenses
are
paid.
i
say
the
very
loan
itself
is
peerless.
then
i
say
that
interest
is
a
matter
of
second
regard
there.
and
yes
indeed,
i
believe
that
unless
there's
a
court
order
collateralizing
this
man
and
certainly
assuring
that
if
he's
interested
up
until
the
date
of
adjudication
or
confirmation
whichever
occurs
and
after
working
the
case
of
confirmation,
that
the
loan
is
very
risky.
now,
may
i
say
so
that
i
didn't
believe
that
the
trust
fund
argument
was
going
to
come
up
because
i
understood
the
government
to
say
that
they
were
abandoning.
clearly,
the
trust
fund
argument
has
no
application
or
whatsoever
to
interest
collection.
and
it
has
no
application
whatsoever
to
penalty
funds.
and
i
don't
think
if
there's
no
raise
involved
or
if
the
raise
has
been
dissipated,
that
there's
any
possibility
of
it
applying
to
the
situations
that
we're
concerned
with
here.
i
want
--
but
my
last
point
to
say
that
the
boteler
case
clearly
involves
the
case
where
the
trustee
himself
operated
the
vehicles
on
the
highway
of
california.
it
did
not
involve
a
situation
where
the
trustee
had
to
respond
for
the
debtor
in
possessions
operating
the
vehicles
on
the
california
highways.
i
think
in
fact
this
california
statute
has
contrasted
with
the
federal
statute
makes
no
difference.
now
lastly,
may
i
say
that
it
is
my
hope
or
our
hope
in
presenting
this
case
that
we
can
encourage
the
government
which
is
deriving
considerable
revenue
from
bankruptcy
situations
to
be
in
and
to
start
in
this
situation
so
that
they
are
participants
when
the
question
of
loans
or
advances
or
payments
on
tax
accounts
can
be
made
so
that
they
can
ask
the
referee
to
compel
the
trust
--
to
compel
the
debtor
in
possession
to
post
an
adequate
indemnity
bond
to
prevent
just
what
has
occurred
here.
they
can
ask
the
trustee
for
payment
and
if
he
refuses
and
there's
money
available
ask
the
referee
for
an
order
directing
his
payments
then
and
seek
the
relief
at
that
time.
i
do
not
believe
the
government
having
great
statutory
privileges
in
this
situation
can
sit
back,
rest
on
their
position,
and
subsequently
seek
to
penalize
the
general
estate.
and
we
submit
to
those
reasons
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
reversed.
