mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
answering
directly
the
argument
which
counsel
has
made
that
the
government's
position
is
unfair
and
clearly
inequitable,
i
think
it's
important
to
make
very
clear
the
period
with
which
we're
dealing
the
nature
and
character
of
the
tax
since
which
formed
the
basis
of
this
dispute
and
to
consider
some
of
the
tax
collection
statutes
which
are
applicable
in
this
circumstance.
now,
the
debtor
in
possession
here
operated
the
business
from
august
5th,
1958,
the
date
on
which
the
petition
was
filed,
that
is
the
petition
for
an
arrangement
to
september
17,
1958
when
he
was
adjudicated
as
bankrupt.
the
taxes
which
formed
the
basis
of
this
dispute
were
incurred
during
this
period
while
the
debtor
in
possession
was
operating
the
business
under
the
provision
of
the
court.
we
think
this
is
important
because
what
counsel
is
actually
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
extend
the
rule
relating
to
penalties
and
interests
incurred
during
the
prebankruptcy
with
respect
to
prebankruptcy
claims.
he
is
asking
the
court
to
extend
that
rule
to
penalties
and
interests
which
are
incurred
after
the
bankruptcy
occurs,
after
the
business
has
been
placed
under
the
supervision
of
the
court.
now,
the
taxes
which
formed
the
basis
of
this
dispute
fall
into
four
general
categories.
first,
the
income
tax
withholding.
the
debtor
in
possession
employed
certain
employees
and
subtracted
from
their
wages,
wages
which
he
would
otherwise
and
have
to
pay
them,
the
amount
of
the
tax
--
the
income
tax
which
he
was
supposed
to
hold.
now,
as
a
result
of
that
withholding,
the
employees
received
the
credit
for
the
income
tax
and
could
in
fact
have
received
a
refund
even
though
that
money
never
found
its
way
to
the
treasury
department.
the
same
thing
is
true
with
respect
to
the
social
security
taxes.
now
as
to
the
cabaret
tax,
the
tax
worked
like
this.
the
customer
went
into
the
cabaret
and
had
a
bill,
let's
say
for
$20.
the
statute
laid
a
tax
of
20%
which
meant
that
$4
was
then
added
to
the
bill.
now,
this
$4
never
really
became
any
asset
of
the
operator
of
the
cabaret
because
it
was
always,
if
it
fell
in
the
place
to
which
it
was
truly
destined,
it
was
always
earmarked
for
the
government.
these
are
the
bulk
of
the
taxes
which
are
here
in
dispute.
in
addition,
there
were
the
employer
share
of
the
social
security
taxes
and
the
unemployment
compensation
tax.
now,
substantial
part
of
the
revenue
which
is
collected
by
the
federal
government
comes
from
withholding.
and
very
substantial
sums
are
in
the
hands
of
men
who
operate
business.
congress
accordingly
has
adopted
extraordinary
measures
to
see
that
these
taxes
are
collected.
now,
the
basic
theory
of
the
collection
of
these
taxes
is
that
the
employer
or
the
operator
of
the
business
simply
serves
as
a
conduit
of
those
taxes
to
the
federal
government.
even
though
he
has
a
conduit,
he
has
made
personally
liable
however
and
becomes
subjected
to
penalties
and
interest
in
appropriate
circumstances.
the
purpose
of
imposing
the
personal
liability
as
to
permit
the
use
of
the
summary
collection
procedures
which
are
applicable
with
respect
to
other
taxes,
but
more
important,
with
respect
to
this
controversy
which
is
before
the
court.
section
7501
of
the
internal
revenue
code
provides
that
any
person
who
collects
or
withholds
a
tax
and
that
money
has
to
be
paid
over
to
the
federal
government,
the
amount
of
the
tax
so
collected
and
these
were
the
words
of
the
statute,
the
amount
of
the
tax
so
collected
or
withheld
shall
be
a
special
fund
in
trust
for
the
united
states.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
there
is
the
possibility,
mr.
justice
white,
that
there
were
no
funds
available
to
be
turned
over
at
that
particular
time.
they
had
filed
the
--
there
were
prebankruptcy
taxes
of
course.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
it
does
not.
during
the
period
of
bankruptcy
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
period
that
the
business
has
operated
under
the
supervision
of
the
court
and
the
period
in
which
it
is
not.
the
cases
upheld
that
where
the
business
is
in
the
hands
of
the
private
individual,
is
not
operated
under
the
supervision
of
the
court,
it
is
necessary
to
trace
the
trustee
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
yes.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
your
honors
we're
not
contending
that
we're
entitled
to
the
--
to
the
interest
and
penalties
here
as
a
trust
fund.
that
is
not
our
position.
i
point
this
trust
fund
out
to
you
to
point
it
out
that
the
--
that
the
debtor
in
possession
was
actually
using
money
which
belonged
to
the
united
states
during
this
period.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
it
has
--
it
has
to
do
with
priority
because
borrowed
funds
during
the
period
that
a
debtor
is
in
possession
are
funds
on
which
the
debtor
in
possession
ordinarily
has
to
pay
interest.
and
if
those
directed
to
his
--
to
the
contention
which
counsel
has
advanced
to
the
effect
that
there
should
be
no
post-petition
interest
because
during
the
--
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
the
court,
the
bankruptcy
court
may
authorize
the
borrowing
of
money
and
when
the
money
is
borrowed,
it's
necessary
of
course
to
pay
interest.
and
so
the
idea
of
paying
interest
following
a
petition
in
bankruptcy
is
not
as
far
as
his
counsel
would
have
us
--
have
us
believe.
now
we
believe
that
the
answer
to
the
question
which
is
before
the
court
has
been
given
by
congress
in
very
explicit
terms.
section
960
of
the
judicial
code
provides
that
any
officers
or
agents
conducting
any
business
under
authority
of
the
united
states
court
shall
be
subject
to
our
federal
state
and
local
taxes
applicable
to
such
business
to
the
same
extent
as
if
it
were
conducted
by
an
individual
or
corporation.
now,
this
statute
was
a
subject
to
the
decision
written
by
this
court
in
1941
in
the
case
of
boteler
versus
ingels
which
came
out
of
california.
in
this
case,
the
state
of
california
claimed
a
100%
penalty
against
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
who
is
engaged
in
liquidating
the
assets
of
a
bankrupt
corporation.
the
bankrupt
corporation
had
been
engaged
in
the
operating
of
a
dairy.
it
operated
trucks.
the
state
license
fee
was
due
on
january
1st,
1937.
it
was
not
paid.
the
trucks
were
sold
on
february
27th,
1937.
the
state
of
california
claimed
a
100%
penalty
because
those
license
fees
had
not
been
paid
on
time.
the
trustee
offered
the
state
the
amount
of
the
registration
fees
at
the
time
the
trucks
were
sold.
the
state
insisted
upon
the
penalty
and
this
court
upheld
the
imposition
of
the
penalty.
the
trustee
there
made
precisely
the
same
argument
which
the
trustee
is
making
here,
namely,
that
penalties
against
prebankrupt
claims
were
not
allowable.
therefore,
these
claims
were
not
allowable.
this
court
rejected
that
contention
and
held
at
section
57(j)
of
the
bankruptcy
act
did
not
prevent
the
imposition
of
penalties
against
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
the
court
with
respect
to
section
960
says
that
congress
has
here
declared
with
vigor
and
clarity
that
a
trustee
who
operates
a
business
must
do
so
subject
to
the
state
tax
the
same
as
it
had
business
who
were
owned
by
an
individual
or
corporation.
now,
this
--
this
has
been
a
landmark
decision
in
the
bankruptcy
area.
it
has
never
been
questioned.
we
feel
that
it
controls
here.
the
standard
is
this.
if
a
private
individual
or
corporation
is
subject
to
the
tax,
then
the
trustee
operating
the
business
would
be
subject
to
the
tax.
now,
counsel
says
that
the
trustee
here
did
not
operate
the
business,
but
the
debtor
in
possession
did
operate
the
business
and
the
debtor
in
possession
is
an
officer
of
the
court.
the
debtor
in
possession
is
an
agent
of
the
court,
he
files
clearly
within
this
statute.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
yes,
your
honor
and
with
respect
to
that
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
your
honor
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
your
honor
please,
there
is
no
provision
in
the
bankruptcy
act
specifically
on
that
point.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
we
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
in
the
internal
revenue
code,
it
say
--
it's
our
position
that
section
6011
which
specifically
provides
that
a
person
who
is
liable
for
a
tax
shall
file
a
return.
and
as
we
understand
the
bankruptcy
act,
it
makes
the
trustee
who
succeeds
a
debtor
in
possession
liable
for
the
tax.
section
342
of
the
bankruptcy
act
for
example,
says
that
the
debtor
in
possession
has
title
and
exercises
the
power
of
a
trustee,
and
is
subject
to
all
times
of
the
control
of
the
court
and
section
302
provides
that
when
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
follows
an
arrangement
proceeding
or
a
debtor
in
possession,
the
date
of
the
adjudication
is
related
back
to
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
petition.
so
you
must
view
it
from
the
time
that
the
petition
is
filed
in
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
bankruptcy
proceeding.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
it
--
by
adding
one
more
section
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
if
i
may,
to
this
presentation,
section
3782
provide
that
upon
the
entry
of
an
order
that
the
bankruptcy
shall
be
proceeded
with,
the
proceedings
shall
be
conducted
so
far
as
possible
in
the
same
manner
and
with
the
light
effect
as
if
a
voluntary
petition
for
adjudication
had
been
filed
and
a
decree
of
adjudication
had
been
entered
on
the
date
when
the
bankruptcy
petition
was
filed.
so
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
yes,
sir,
i
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
3782,
yes
sir.
it's
--
it's
on
page
30
of
the
appendix,
sir.
now,
the
text
writers
and
the
decisions
of
the
court
emphasized
over
and
over
again
that
where
you
have
a
bankruptcy
trustee
exceeding
--
and
a
debtor
in
possession
arrangement
that
there
is
no
break
in
the
continuity
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
your
honor,
this
is
a
--
that
section
64(a)
sets
up
a
sub-priority
as
we
understand
you
to
cover
liquidation
expenses.
but
that
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
question
as
we
see
it
as
to
whether
there
is
a
liability
for
interest.
this
went
in
to
the
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
that
approach
does
violence
to
the
concept
that
this
is
one
continuous
administration.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
well
i
--
if
the
claim
which
was
in
question
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
suppose
that
the
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
certainly
there
is
no
problem
with
filing
the
return.
that
creates
no
obligation,
no
problem
for
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
the
law
says
that
the
return
shall
be
filed
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
and
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
and
so
if
--
the
return
can
be
filed
without
creating
a
hardship
to
anyone.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
well,
it's
our
view
that
you
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
it's
our
view
that
he
must
pay
the
tax.
now,
of
course
there
are
situations
where
he
doesn't
have
assets
to
pay
the
tax.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
for
the
immediate
term
about
the
liquidation
expenses,
in
those
circumstances,
he
is
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
he
would
be
with
respect
to
any
other
liability
incurred
by
the
debtor
in
possession
which
bears
interest.
if
he
didn't
have
the
money
to
pay
it,
he
wouldn't
pay
it,
of
course,
except
that
(voice
overlap)
except
with
respect
to
the
trust
fund.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
except
with
respect
to
the
trust
fund.
the
penalty
is
attributable
or
the
penalty
is
due
only
if
he
fails
to
file
a
return.
now,
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
the
tax
when
he
files
a
return.
and
so
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
that's
right.
that's
correct.
but
he
can
--
that
the
penalty
is
laid
for
failing
to
file
the
return.
the
interest
is
applicable
if
he
does
not
pay
the
tax
on
time.
now,
bear
in
mind
that
these
are
--
these
are
trust
funds
also.
these
are
--
these
are
monies
which
belong
to
the
united
states.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
if
we're
correct,
of
course
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
if
there's
not
enough
to
pay
them
both,
if
we're
correct
with
respect
to
the
trust
fund
theory,
then
those
money
has
never
been
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
alright.
then
the
expenses
of
liquidation
would
have
to
come
first.
if
--
the
trust
fund,
it
doesn't
apply.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
well,
if
he
have
paid
them
out,
if
he
--
if
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
had
paid
more,
then
the
share
in
which
the
government
was
entitled
under
the
first
priority
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
--
it
would
be
possible
for
him
to
apply
for
a
return
to
the
internal
revenue
service.
and
it's
my
understanding
that
this
is
a
practice
of
the
internal
revenue
service
to
return
money
where
more
than
the
amount
when
it
is
received
more
than
the
amount
to
which
it
is
entitled
under
the
first
priority.
certainly,
if
any
creditor
or
any
debtor
can
rely
upon
anybody,
returning
money,
it
should
be
possible
to
get
it
back
from
the
united
states.
it
doesn't
--
you
don't
run
the
risk
of
bankruptcy
in
these
circumstances
and
the
inability
to
get
it
back
on
account
of
the
inability
to
pay.
we
think
that
your
honor
if
you
--
i
think
that
the
approach
that
you're
taking
completely
overlooks
the
continuing
--
continuity
which
exists
between
the
debtor
in
possession
and
the
trustee.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
well,
if
you
--
if
that
is
the
position
then
i
think
that
i've
answered
your
question
if
there
is
and
not
enough,
if
we're
correct
with
respect
to
the
trust
funds
and
the
government
is
entitled
with
the
trust
funds,
if
we're
incorrect
with
respect
to
that
and
it
is
not
in
fact
a
trust,
then
the
liquidation
expense
in
the
succeeding
bankruptcy
would
come
first.
i
think
that
that
is
quite
clear.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
but
that's
not
what
we
have
here
if,
your
honor
please.
here,
the
record
shows
that
there's
$8,000
in
the
bank.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
and
i
suppose
that
it's
in
a
deposit
in
drawing
money,
drawing
interest
itself
which
eventually
will
increase
the
amount
which
may
be
distributed
to
the
general
creditors
or
which
may
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
if
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
one
way
to
--
one
way
to
do
that,
of
course,
would
be
to
have
a
condition
specifically
stated
in
the
order
authorizing
the
payment
to
the
effect
that
it
is
paid
to
the
internal
revenue
service
on
condition
that
it
will
be
returned.
the
revenue
service
maintains
the
expense
accounts
in
many
circumstances
where
there
have
been
conditional
payments
of
taxes.
so
i
think
that
the
--
the
risk
of
paying
the
government
would
be
just
about
as
little
as
it
would
be
possible
to
have
any
situation
like
that.
we
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
boteler
versus
ingels
that
you
have
here
a
standard
which
has
been
laid
down
by
this
court,
by
congress
to
the
effect
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
liability
is
to
be
paid
and
when
it
is
to
be
paid,
you
treat
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
even
though
he
succeeds
a
debtor
in
possession
in
exactly
the
same
light
as
you
would
that
if
it
were
a
private
individual
or
corporation.
now,
as
to
the
saper
case
relied
upon
so
heavily
by
counsel,
let
me
point
out
that
this
case
involved
claims
which
were
incurred
prior
to
the
adjudication
of
bankruptcy.
an
interest
was
claimed
by
the
government
on
that.
the
court
there
pointed
out
that
it
was
historical.
that
there
was
a
cut-off
point
and
that
after
the
cut-off
point
interest
it
was
not
paid
on
any
claims
which
were
outstanding
against
a
bankrupt.
and
the
court
explained
that
it
would
be
unfair
because
of
the
varying
rates
of
interest
to
allow
interest
against
creditors
in
these
circumstances.
the
court
was
concerned
with
the
effect
of
the
1926
and
1938
acts
amending
the
bankruptcy
act.
under
the
bankruptcy
act
of
1898,
taxes
were
given
an
absolute
priority
and
they
carried
interest
until
they
were
paid.
under
the
1926
act,
the
taxes
were
concerned
to
a
fourth
priority.
the
chandler
act
of
1938
provided
in
section
57(n)
that
the
government
should
be
required
to
file
a
proof
of
claim
just
like
other
debtors.
the
court
concluded
that
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
was
to
assimilate
tax
debts
to
other
debts,
and
prebankruptcy
interest
was
not
allowable
on
other
debts
therefore
it
was
not
allowable
on
tax
debts.
but
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
opinion
says
nothing
about
section
960.
it
says
nothing
about
boteler
versus
ingels.
it
says
nothing
about
the
administration
expense
either.
we
believe
that
it
has
absolutely
no
applicability
when
you
start
dealing
with
the
administration
expenses.
the
reasoning
of
the
opinion
simply
doesn't
apply.
we
contend
that
it
would
be
inequitable
and
unfair
to
allow
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
as
this
one
has
apparently
done,
to
keep
the
money
which
under
the
trust
fund
theory
actually
belongs
to
the
united
states
if
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
it
depends
upon
whether
he
has
obtained
the
authority
of
the
court
to
carry
on
the
business
at
this
time.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
well
he
had
--
if
the
court
outlines
the
circumstances
in
which
the
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
and
the
conditions
under
which
the
debtor
in
possession
may
carry
on
his
business,
he's
under
the
supervision
or
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
it
withdraws
6%
interest.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
yes
sir.
you
say
that
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
yes,
well
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
i
think
it's
undoubtedly
true.
how
else
--
who
would
bar
--
who
would
lend
money
to
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
or
debtor
in
possession
unless
he's
going
to
draw
interest?
the
interest
is
tremendously
important
if
the
--
if
the
man
is
to
be
rehabilitated.
and
the
interest
is
not
at
all
far
into
the
concept
of
a
debtor
in
possession
or
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
no
sir,
we're
not
--
we're
not
making
any
special
claim
whatever
on
behalf
of
the
government.
we're
saying
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
equal
treatment
that
--
that
the
money
which
has
been
used
really
belongs
to
the
government.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
here
again,
it
would
depend
upon
the
terms
and
conditions
specified
on
the
report.
assuming
that
they
are
not
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
then
it
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
then
it
would
be
an
administration
expense
on
the
debtor
in
possession.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
the
liquidation
expenses
would
come
ahead
of
that.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
yes,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
well,
there
are
proceedings
which
are
brought
in
connection
with
the
recovery
of
excessive
funds.
i'm
sure
that
the
risk
is
far
greater
in
connection
with
the
private
creditor.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
well,
i
think
that
preterm
would
require
him
to
wait
and
see
whether
or
not
--
whether
or
not,
there
would
be
sufficient
assets
that
you
continue
to
accrue
(voice
overlap)
yes
sir,
interest
would
continue
to
accrue.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
this
is
their
product.
it
is
having
barred
with
funds
in
the
first
place.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
so
it's
our
conclusion
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
correct
in
the
decision
which
it
made.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
answering
directly
the
argument
which
counsel
has
made
that
the
government's
position
is
unfair
and
clearly
inequitable,
i
think
it's
important
to
make
very
clear
the
period
with
which
we're
dealing
the
nature
and
character
of
the
tax
since
which
formed
the
basis
of
this
dispute
and
to
consider
some
of
the
tax
collection
statutes
which
are
applicable
in
this
circumstance.
now,
the
debtor
in
possession
here
operated
the
business
from
august
5th,
1958,
the
date
on
which
the
petition
was
filed,
that
is
the
petition
for
an
arrangement
to
september
17,
1958
when
he
was
adjudicated
as
bankrupt.
the
taxes
which
formed
the
basis
of
this
dispute
were
incurred
during
this
period
while
the
debtor
in
possession
was
operating
the
business
under
the
provision
of
the
court.
we
think
this
is
important
because
what
counsel
is
actually
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
extend
the
rule
relating
to
penalties
and
interests
incurred
during
the
prebankruptcy
with
respect
to
prebankruptcy
claims.
he
is
asking
the
court
to
extend
that
rule
to
penalties
and
interests
which
are
incurred
after
the
bankruptcy
occurs,
after
the
business
has
been
placed
under
the
supervision
of
the
court.
now,
the
taxes
which
formed
the
basis
of
this
dispute
fall
into
four
general
categories.
first,
the
income
tax
withholding.
the
debtor
in
possession
employed
certain
employees
and
subtracted
from
their
wages,
wages
which
he
would
otherwise
and
have
to
pay
them,
the
amount
of
the
tax
--
the
income
tax
which
he
was
supposed
to
hold.
now,
as
a
result
of
that
withholding,
the
employees
received
the
credit
for
the
income
tax
and
could
in
fact
have
received
a
refund
even
though
that
money
never
found
its
way
to
the
treasury
department.
the
same
thing
is
true
with
respect
to
the
social
security
taxes.
now
as
to
the
cabaret
tax,
the
tax
worked
like
this.
the
customer
went
into
the
cabaret
and
had
a
bill,
let's
say
for
$20.
the
statute
laid
a
tax
of
20%
which
meant
that
$4
was
then
added
to
the
bill.
now,
this
$4
never
really
became
any
asset
of
the
operator
of
the
cabaret
because
it
was
always,
if
it
fell
in
the
place
to
which
it
was
truly
destined,
it
was
always
earmarked
for
the
government.
these
are
the
bulk
of
the
taxes
which
are
here
in
dispute.
in
addition,
there
were
the
employer
share
of
the
social
security
taxes
and
the
unemployment
compensation
tax.
now,
substantial
part
of
the
revenue
which
is
collected
by
the
federal
government
comes
from
withholding.
and
very
substantial
sums
are
in
the
hands
of
men
who
operate
business.
congress
accordingly
has
adopted
extraordinary
measures
to
see
that
these
taxes
are
collected.
now,
the
basic
theory
of
the
collection
of
these
taxes
is
that
the
employer
or
the
operator
of
the
business
simply
serves
as
a
conduit
of
those
taxes
to
the
federal
government.
even
though
he
has
a
conduit,
he
has
made
personally
liable
however
and
becomes
subjected
to
penalties
and
interest
in
appropriate
circumstances.
the
purpose
of
imposing
the
personal
liability
as
to
permit
the
use
of
the
summary
collection
procedures
which
are
applicable
with
respect
to
other
taxes,
but
more
important,
with
respect
to
this
controversy
which
is
before
the
court.
section
7501
of
the
internal
revenue
code
provides
that
any
person
who
collects
or
withholds
a
tax
and
that
money
has
to
be
paid
over
to
the
federal
government,
the
amount
of
the
tax
so
collected
and
these
were
the
words
of
the
statute,
the
amount
of
the
tax
so
collected
or
withheld
shall
be
a
special
fund
in
trust
for
the
united
states.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
there
is
the
possibility,
mr.
justice
white,
that
there
were
no
funds
available
to
be
turned
over
at
that
particular
time.
they
had
filed
the
--
there
were
prebankruptcy
taxes
of
course.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
it
does
not.
during
the
period
of
bankruptcy
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
period
that
the
business
has
operated
under
the
supervision
of
the
court
and
the
period
in
which
it
is
not.
the
cases
upheld
that
where
the
business
is
in
the
hands
of
the
private
individual,
is
not
operated
under
the
supervision
of
the
court,
it
is
necessary
to
trace
the
trustee
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
yes.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
your
honors
we're
not
contending
that
we're
entitled
to
the
--
to
the
interest
and
penalties
here
as
a
trust
fund.
that
is
not
our
position.
i
point
this
trust
fund
out
to
you
to
point
it
out
that
the
--
that
the
debtor
in
possession
was
actually
using
money
which
belonged
to
the
united
states
during
this
period.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
it
has
--
it
has
to
do
with
priority
because
borrowed
funds
during
the
period
that
a
debtor
is
in
possession
are
funds
on
which
the
debtor
in
possession
ordinarily
has
to
pay
interest.
and
if
those
directed
to
his
--
to
the
contention
which
counsel
has
advanced
to
the
effect
that
there
should
be
no
post-petition
interest
because
during
the
--
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
the
court,
the
bankruptcy
court
may
authorize
the
borrowing
of
money
and
when
the
money
is
borrowed,
it's
necessary
of
course
to
pay
interest.
and
so
the
idea
of
paying
interest
following
a
petition
in
bankruptcy
is
not
as
far
as
his
counsel
would
have
us
--
have
us
believe.
now
we
believe
that
the
answer
to
the
question
which
is
before
the
court
has
been
given
by
congress
in
very
explicit
terms.
section
960
of
the
judicial
code
provides
that
any
officers
or
agents
conducting
any
business
under
authority
of
the
united
states
court
shall
be
subject
to
our
federal
state
and
local
taxes
applicable
to
such
business
to
the
same
extent
as
if
it
were
conducted
by
an
individual
or
corporation.
now,
this
statute
was
a
subject
to
the
decision
written
by
this
court
in
1941
in
the
case
of
boteler
versus
ingels
which
came
out
of
california.
in
this
case,
the
state
of
california
claimed
a
100%
penalty
against
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
who
is
engaged
in
liquidating
the
assets
of
a
bankrupt
corporation.
the
bankrupt
corporation
had
been
engaged
in
the
operating
of
a
dairy.
it
operated
trucks.
the
state
license
fee
was
due
on
january
1st,
1937.
it
was
not
paid.
the
trucks
were
sold
on
february
27th,
1937.
the
state
of
california
claimed
a
100%
penalty
because
those
license
fees
had
not
been
paid
on
time.
the
trustee
offered
the
state
the
amount
of
the
registration
fees
at
the
time
the
trucks
were
sold.
the
state
insisted
upon
the
penalty
and
this
court
upheld
the
imposition
of
the
penalty.
the
trustee
there
made
precisely
the
same
argument
which
the
trustee
is
making
here,
namely,
that
penalties
against
prebankrupt
claims
were
not
allowable.
therefore,
these
claims
were
not
allowable.
this
court
rejected
that
contention
and
held
at
section
57(j)
of
the
bankruptcy
act
did
not
prevent
the
imposition
of
penalties
against
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
the
court
with
respect
to
section
960
says
that
congress
has
here
declared
with
vigor
and
clarity
that
a
trustee
who
operates
a
business
must
do
so
subject
to
the
state
tax
the
same
as
it
had
business
who
were
owned
by
an
individual
or
corporation.
now,
this
--
this
has
been
a
landmark
decision
in
the
bankruptcy
area.
it
has
never
been
questioned.
we
feel
that
it
controls
here.
the
standard
is
this.
if
a
private
individual
or
corporation
is
subject
to
the
tax,
then
the
trustee
operating
the
business
would
be
subject
to
the
tax.
now,
counsel
says
that
the
trustee
here
did
not
operate
the
business,
but
the
debtor
in
possession
did
operate
the
business
and
the
debtor
in
possession
is
an
officer
of
the
court.
the
debtor
in
possession
is
an
agent
of
the
court,
he
files
clearly
within
this
statute.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
yes,
your
honor
and
with
respect
to
that
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
your
honor
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
your
honor
please,
there
is
no
provision
in
the
bankruptcy
act
specifically
on
that
point.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
we
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
in
the
internal
revenue
code,
it
say
--
it's
our
position
that
section
6011
which
specifically
provides
that
a
person
who
is
liable
for
a
tax
shall
file
a
return.
and
as
we
understand
the
bankruptcy
act,
it
makes
the
trustee
who
succeeds
a
debtor
in
possession
liable
for
the
tax.
section
342
of
the
bankruptcy
act
for
example,
says
that
the
debtor
in
possession
has
title
and
exercises
the
power
of
a
trustee,
and
is
subject
to
all
times
of
the
control
of
the
court
and
section
302
provides
that
when
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
follows
an
arrangement
proceeding
or
a
debtor
in
possession,
the
date
of
the
adjudication
is
related
back
to
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
petition.
so
you
must
view
it
from
the
time
that
the
petition
is
filed
in
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
bankruptcy
proceeding.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
it
--
by
adding
one
more
section
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
if
i
may,
to
this
presentation,
section
3782
provide
that
upon
the
entry
of
an
order
that
the
bankruptcy
shall
be
proceeded
with,
the
proceedings
shall
be
conducted
so
far
as
possible
in
the
same
manner
and
with
the
light
effect
as
if
a
voluntary
petition
for
adjudication
had
been
filed
and
a
decree
of
adjudication
had
been
entered
on
the
date
when
the
bankruptcy
petition
was
filed.
so
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
yes,
sir,
i
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
3782,
yes
sir.
it's
--
it's
on
page
30
of
the
appendix,
sir.
now,
the
text
writers
and
the
decisions
of
the
court
emphasized
over
and
over
again
that
where
you
have
a
bankruptcy
trustee
exceeding
--
and
a
debtor
in
possession
arrangement
that
there
is
no
break
in
the
continuity
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
your
honor,
this
is
a
--
that
section
64(a)
sets
up
a
sub-priority
as
we
understand
you
to
cover
liquidation
expenses.
but
that
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
question
as
we
see
it
as
to
whether
there
is
a
liability
for
interest.
this
went
in
to
the
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
that
approach
does
violence
to
the
concept
that
this
is
one
continuous
administration.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
well
i
--
if
the
claim
which
was
in
question
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
suppose
that
the
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
certainly
there
is
no
problem
with
filing
the
return.
that
creates
no
obligation,
no
problem
for
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
the
law
says
that
the
return
shall
be
filed
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
and
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
and
so
if
--
the
return
can
be
filed
without
creating
a
hardship
to
anyone.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
well,
it's
our
view
that
you
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
it's
our
view
that
he
must
pay
the
tax.
now,
of
course
there
are
situations
where
he
doesn't
have
assets
to
pay
the
tax.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
for
the
immediate
term
about
the
liquidation
expenses,
in
those
circumstances,
he
is
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
he
would
be
with
respect
to
any
other
liability
incurred
by
the
debtor
in
possession
which
bears
interest.
if
he
didn't
have
the
money
to
pay
it,
he
wouldn't
pay
it,
of
course,
except
that
(voice
overlap)
except
with
respect
to
the
trust
fund.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
except
with
respect
to
the
trust
fund.
the
penalty
is
attributable
or
the
penalty
is
due
only
if
he
fails
to
file
a
return.
now,
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
the
tax
when
he
files
a
return.
and
so
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
that's
right.
that's
correct.
but
he
can
--
that
the
penalty
is
laid
for
failing
to
file
the
return.
the
interest
is
applicable
if
he
does
not
pay
the
tax
on
time.
now,
bear
in
mind
that
these
are
--
these
are
trust
funds
also.
these
are
--
these
are
monies
which
belong
to
the
united
states.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
if
we're
correct,
of
course
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
if
there's
not
enough
to
pay
them
both,
if
we're
correct
with
respect
to
the
trust
fund
theory,
then
those
money
has
never
been
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
alright.
then
the
expenses
of
liquidation
would
have
to
come
first.
if
--
the
trust
fund,
it
doesn't
apply.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
well,
if
he
have
paid
them
out,
if
he
--
if
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
had
paid
more,
then
the
share
in
which
the
government
was
entitled
under
the
first
priority
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
--
it
would
be
possible
for
him
to
apply
for
a
return
to
the
internal
revenue
service.
and
it's
my
understanding
that
this
is
a
practice
of
the
internal
revenue
service
to
return
money
where
more
than
the
amount
when
it
is
received
more
than
the
amount
to
which
it
is
entitled
under
the
first
priority.
certainly,
if
any
creditor
or
any
debtor
can
rely
upon
anybody,
returning
money,
it
should
be
possible
to
get
it
back
from
the
united
states.
it
doesn't
--
you
don't
run
the
risk
of
bankruptcy
in
these
circumstances
and
the
inability
to
get
it
back
on
account
of
the
inability
to
pay.
we
think
that
your
honor
if
you
--
i
think
that
the
approach
that
you're
taking
completely
overlooks
the
continuing
--
continuity
which
exists
between
the
debtor
in
possession
and
the
trustee.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
well,
if
you
--
if
that
is
the
position
then
i
think
that
i've
answered
your
question
if
there
is
and
not
enough,
if
we're
correct
with
respect
to
the
trust
funds
and
the
government
is
entitled
with
the
trust
funds,
if
we're
incorrect
with
respect
to
that
and
it
is
not
in
fact
a
trust,
then
the
liquidation
expense
in
the
succeeding
bankruptcy
would
come
first.
i
think
that
that
is
quite
clear.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
but
that's
not
what
we
have
here
if,
your
honor
please.
here,
the
record
shows
that
there's
$8,000
in
the
bank.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
and
i
suppose
that
it's
in
a
deposit
in
drawing
money,
drawing
interest
itself
which
eventually
will
increase
the
amount
which
may
be
distributed
to
the
general
creditors
or
which
may
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
if
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
one
way
to
--
one
way
to
do
that,
of
course,
would
be
to
have
a
condition
specifically
stated
in
the
order
authorizing
the
payment
to
the
effect
that
it
is
paid
to
the
internal
revenue
service
on
condition
that
it
will
be
returned.
the
revenue
service
maintains
the
expense
accounts
in
many
circumstances
where
there
have
been
conditional
payments
of
taxes.
so
i
think
that
the
--
the
risk
of
paying
the
government
would
be
just
about
as
little
as
it
would
be
possible
to
have
any
situation
like
that.
we
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
boteler
versus
ingels
that
you
have
here
a
standard
which
has
been
laid
down
by
this
court,
by
congress
to
the
effect
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
liability
is
to
be
paid
and
when
it
is
to
be
paid,
you
treat
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
even
though
he
succeeds
a
debtor
in
possession
in
exactly
the
same
light
as
you
would
that
if
it
were
a
private
individual
or
corporation.
now,
as
to
the
saper
case
relied
upon
so
heavily
by
counsel,
let
me
point
out
that
this
case
involved
claims
which
were
incurred
prior
to
the
adjudication
of
bankruptcy.
an
interest
was
claimed
by
the
government
on
that.
the
court
there
pointed
out
that
it
was
historical.
that
there
was
a
cut-off
point
and
that
after
the
cut-off
point
interest
it
was
not
paid
on
any
claims
which
were
outstanding
against
a
bankrupt.
and
the
court
explained
that
it
would
be
unfair
because
of
the
varying
rates
of
interest
to
allow
interest
against
creditors
in
these
circumstances.
the
court
was
concerned
with
the
effect
of
the
1926
and
1938
acts
amending
the
bankruptcy
act.
under
the
bankruptcy
act
of
1898,
taxes
were
given
an
absolute
priority
and
they
carried
interest
until
they
were
paid.
under
the
1926
act,
the
taxes
were
concerned
to
a
fourth
priority.
the
chandler
act
of
1938
provided
in
section
57(n)
that
the
government
should
be
required
to
file
a
proof
of
claim
just
like
other
debtors.
the
court
concluded
that
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
was
to
assimilate
tax
debts
to
other
debts,
and
prebankruptcy
interest
was
not
allowable
on
other
debts
therefore
it
was
not
allowable
on
tax
debts.
but
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
opinion
says
nothing
about
section
960.
it
says
nothing
about
boteler
versus
ingels.
it
says
nothing
about
the
administration
expense
either.
we
believe
that
it
has
absolutely
no
applicability
when
you
start
dealing
with
the
administration
expenses.
the
reasoning
of
the
opinion
simply
doesn't
apply.
we
contend
that
it
would
be
inequitable
and
unfair
to
allow
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
as
this
one
has
apparently
done,
to
keep
the
money
which
under
the
trust
fund
theory
actually
belongs
to
the
united
states
if
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
it
depends
upon
whether
he
has
obtained
the
authority
of
the
court
to
carry
on
the
business
at
this
time.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
well
he
had
--
if
the
court
outlines
the
circumstances
in
which
the
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
and
the
conditions
under
which
the
debtor
in
possession
may
carry
on
his
business,
he's
under
the
supervision
or
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
it
withdraws
6%
interest.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
yes
sir.
you
say
that
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
yes,
well
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
i
think
it's
undoubtedly
true.
how
else
--
who
would
bar
--
who
would
lend
money
to
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
or
debtor
in
possession
unless
he's
going
to
draw
interest?
the
interest
is
tremendously
important
if
the
--
if
the
man
is
to
be
rehabilitated.
and
the
interest
is
not
at
all
far
into
the
concept
of
a
debtor
in
possession
or
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
no
sir,
we're
not
--
we're
not
making
any
special
claim
whatever
on
behalf
of
the
government.
we're
saying
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
equal
treatment
that
--
that
the
money
which
has
been
used
really
belongs
to
the
government.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
here
again,
it
would
depend
upon
the
terms
and
conditions
specified
on
the
report.
assuming
that
they
are
not
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
then
it
--
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
then
it
would
be
an
administration
expense
on
the
debtor
in
possession.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
the
liquidation
expenses
would
come
ahead
of
that.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
yes,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
well,
there
are
proceedings
which
are
brought
in
connection
with
the
recovery
of
excessive
funds.
i'm
sure
that
the
risk
is
far
greater
in
connection
with
the
private
creditor.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
well,
i
think
that
preterm
would
require
him
to
wait
and
see
whether
or
not
--
whether
or
not,
there
would
be
sufficient
assets
that
you
continue
to
accrue
(voice
overlap)
yes
sir,
interest
would
continue
to
accrue.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
this
is
their
product.
it
is
having
barred
with
funds
in
the
first
place.
mr.
c.
moxley
featherston
so
it's
our
conclusion
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
correct
in
the
decision
which
it
made.
