he
was
a
--
he
had
escaped
from
the
prison,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
--
where
he
was
under
a
sentence
and
where
he
still
had
some
15
years
to
serve.
justice
potter
stewart
so
there's
no
question
about
that
–
no
question
for
propriety
of
the
locking
him
--
locking
him
up,
keeping
him
locked
up
for
the
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
continue
--
and
deserve
that
present
sentence
where
--
from
which
he'd
escape.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
could
happen
to
anybody
who
has
escaped
from
prison,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
under
--
he
was
under
a
long
prison
sentence,
what?
justice
potter
stewart
--
15
to
20
years
and
when
he
was
recaptured
i
suppose
it's
–
would
he
be
surprised
at
least
which
is
rather
the
normal
thing
you
--
he's
returned
to
prison
and
maybe
in
solitary
confinement.
that
could
ha
--
that
happens
everyday
to
people
who
were
apprehended
after
they
have
escaped
from
prison,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
what
does
--
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
difference?
justice
potter
stewart
well
he
had
stolen
some
things,
hadn't
he
and
just
walked
down
the
railroad
track
to
check
his
stories,
the
the
route
he
had
taken
after
he
had
escaped
from
prison
and
the
circumstances
under
which
he
had
stolen
these
things
off
the
close
lines?
justice
potter
stewart
well
isn't
that
true?
isn't
that
--
justice
potter
stewart

comparing

mr.
bell,
going
back
to
this
document
which
is
reproduced
on
page
110
of
the
record,
i
don't
quite
understand
the
top
one
--
the
top
one
shows
that
he
was
arrested
11:00
pm
on
september
21st,
1959.
the
arresting
officers
were
homberg,
guilon
and
porter,
describes
them
and
it's
there
that
says
“hold
for
hucks
&
fesperman
re
-
mrs.
cooper.
escapee
from
haywood
county
still
has
15
years
to

do
not
allow
anyone
to
see
davis
or
allow
him
to
use
telephone
and
then
going
down
right
below
the
middle
of
the
page,
there
seems
to
be
a
duplication
of
the
same
document,
but
with
other
--
i
mean
the
same
form
with
other
information
in
it.
there
it
says
facts
of
the
arrest
did
kill
and
slay
one
foy
belle
cooper
on
september
20th
in
elmwood
cemetery,
was
that
all
made
out
at
the
same
time
or
these
were
two
different
documents
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
seem
to
be
the
same
form,
you
shall
see
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it's
dated
september
21st
same
way.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
right
down
at
the
bottom
to
the
right.
mr.
justice
fortas
points
out;
it's
stated
october
7th,
1959.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
filled
in
this
--
and
this
--
and
this
bottom
half
was
filled
in
after
a
preliminary
hearing,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
he
has
a
different
age
for
the
man.
he's
age
29
at
the
top
of
the
page,
he's
age
32
on
the
second
half
of
the
page.
justice
potter
stewart
the
age
is
three
years
and
two
weeks.
justice
potter
stewart
he
plead
not
guilty,
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
mean
by
his
rights?
that
--
that's
something
that
hasn't
been
--
justice
potter
stewart
right
to
have
counsel?
where
--
what
do
you
mean
in
the
jail
at
all
times?
justice
potter
stewart
did
he
actually
object?
justice
potter
stewart
it
occurred
immediately
after
the
policemen
gave
prayer,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
handy
uncle
tom?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
was
a
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not.
it's
the
first
time
actually.
it's
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
was
only
to
those
three
judges?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
argument
to
the
court
en
banc?
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
en
banc
is
to
review
the
record
but
only
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
the
three
judges
who
heard
the
case,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
two
of
them
votes
on
your
favor?
justice
potter
stewart
well
it's
certainly
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
he
was
an
escaped
prisoner.
justice
potter
stewart
with
15
years
more
to
serve.
justice
potter
stewart
the
written
confession
mr.
bullock
appears
at
page
360,
through
the
middle
of
the
page
on
362
of
the
record
davis
is
illiterate,
is
he?
justice
potter
stewart
is
davis
illiterate?
can
he
read
or
write?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
does
the
evidence
show
as
to
this
written
confession
which
as
i
say
appears
on
page
360
to
362
of
the
record.
internally
here
it
says
tantamount,
captain
mccall
has
dictated
the
statement
in
the
presence
of
detective
hucks
and
fesperman
and
gardner,
davis
and
detective
lieutenant
sykes
and
i
wondered,
so
it
was
dictated
apparently
by
captain
mccall?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
read
by
davis
or
was
it
read
to
davis?
justice
potter
stewart
he
says
that
here
--
i've
not
been
promised
any
reward
or
hope
of
reward.
i
have
not
been
mistreated
by
any
of
the
detectives
or
any
other
person
who
was
talking
with
me.
i've
been
told
that
i
do
not
have
to
make
a
statement.
and
if
i
do
make
a
statement
or
answer
any
questions
pertaining
to
this
murder
it
can
be
used
against
me
or
for
me
in
the
court
of
law.
and
at
the
end
he
says
“i've
made
the
statement
freely
and
voluntarily.
i'm
glad
it
is
over
because
i
have
been
going
through
a
big
strain
a
little
earlier.
in
closing,
i
want
to
say
this.
i've
known
in
my
own
mind
that
you
people
--
i
suppose
it
means
what
you
people
were
holding
before
that
all
of
the
time
i've
been
lying
in
jail.
it
has
been
worrying
me
and
i
knew
that
sooner
or
later
i
would
have
to
tell
you
about
it.
now
it's
--
i
--
to
me
it's
of
some
importance
how
much
of
this
davis
himself
knew
or
subscribed
to
or
was
it
just
written
by
somebody
else.
justice
potter
stewart
this
davis?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
federal
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
word
fram
mean
in
the
north
carolina
fram?
justice
potter
stewart
i
wonder.
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
a
--
he
had
escaped
from
the
prison,
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
--
where
he
was
under
a
sentence
and
where
he
still
had
some
15
years
to
serve.
justice
potter
stewart
so
there's
no
question
about
that
–
no

for
propriety
of
the
locking
him
--
locking
him
up,
keeping
him

justice
potter
stewart
continue
--
and
deserve
that
present
sentence
where
--
from
which
he'd
escape.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
could
happen
to
anybody
who
has
escaped
from
prison,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
under
--
he
was
under
a
long
prison
sentence,
what?
justice
potter
stewart
--
15
to
20
years
and
when
he
was
recaptured
i
suppose
it's
–
would
he
be

at

which
is
