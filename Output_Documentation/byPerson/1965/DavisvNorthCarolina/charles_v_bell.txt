mr.
charles
v.
bell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
elmer
davis,
the
petitioner,
contends
that
his
petition
for
writ
of
the
habeas
corpus
should
be
granted.
this
case
has
been
in
the
litigation
for
nearly
seven
years
and
elmer
davis,
a
35,
now
35,
i
believe
he
was
about
29
when
this
case
started,
is
in
the
state
present
at
riley
on
death
row.
we
say
we
are
--
i
believe
the
state
would
even
admit
this
that
this
case
stands
or
falls
with
this
confession.
what
i
mean
by
that?
that
the
only
evidence
that
could
possibly
could
link
davis
with
this
murder
is
the
confession,
that's
the
only
thing
in
this
case.
now
if
you
have
notice
on
the
record
page
110,
that
he
was
arrested
by
the
charlotte
police
on
september
the
21,
1959.
they
went
over
there
and
arrested
him.
they
brought
him
back
to
charlotte
and
in
his
presence
they
made
out
that
arrest
sheet.
don't
let
him
use
the
telephone,
don't
let
him
call
anybody,
and
hold
for
hucks
and
fesperman
re
-
foy
bell
cooper,
that's
the
remedy.
so
he
was
arrested
right
there
in
belmont
in
the
police
station.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes,
he
had
--
he
escaped
from
haywood
county
prison
camp.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
well
they
say
that
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
well
what
we
contend
in
this
case
that
the
charlotte
police
department
went
to
belmont
and
the
record
where
arrest
sheet
solely
indicates
it
and
arrested
him
in
belmont,
north
carolina
which
is
another
county
and
brought
him
back
into
gaston
for
the
crime
or
killing
and
murdering
the
white
lady,
mrs.
foy
bell
cooper.
then
--
and
we
say
that
this
--
the
arrest
sheet
and
be
--
our
points
in
this
case
that
he
was
denied,
one,
he
was
denied
counsel
and
number
two
that
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
point
unerringly
that
this
is
of
course
confession
that
it
wasn't
voluntarily
given
by
davis.
and
if
you
--
the
careful
perusal
of
the
fact
presented
by
this
record
in
this
case
would
indicate
that
it
was
coerced
that
they
used
force
and
that
would
--
it
was
involuntarily
obtained.
it's
admitted
davis
is
an
illiterate
man
who
couldn't
read
and
write.
when
they
brought
him
back
to
charlotte
and
still
no
place
i
mean
placing
him
in
the
county
jail,
they
put
him
in
the
police
lockup.
he
was
held
in
solitary
confinement
and
held
incommunicado
for
16
days.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
no
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
by
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
no
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
does
not
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
well
he
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
what's
the
difference
--
the
difference
is
your
honor,
when
a
man
escapes
from
prison
he
violates
the
law
there.
he
violates
the
law
in
the
county
in
which
the
prison
is
located.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
then
he
is
returned
to
prison.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
that's
right.
but
instead
of
that
--
that
it
be
done
--
be
in
this
case,
the
charlotte
police
department
went
into
another
county
and
arrested
him
for
this
murder
which
the
pol
--
the
‘arrest
sheet'
indicates
and
held
him
in
an
overnight
jail
for
16
days.
we
say
and
contend
that
the
charlotte
overnight
jail
isn't
an
extension
of
the
prison
system
of
north
carolina
that
he
was
held
as
a
primary
suspect
arrested
and
held
incommunicado
in
an
overnight
jail
for
16
days.
and
it's
admitted
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
we
would
return
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
they
--
we
return
him
to
the
prison
camp.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
–
police
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
sir?
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
and
i
understand
it's
in
the
record
that
captain
mccall
after
having
gone
over
there
and
having
gotten
in
and
have
them
arrested
him
and
largely
and
in
this
lockup
did
get
permission
from
the
director
of
prisons
to
investigate
this
crime.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
the
overnight
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
the
county
jail
is
right
across
the
street.
it's
within
--
one
street
separates
it
and
we
have
it
in
the
records
here
that
--
it's
in
the
record
that
one
officer
testifying
that
he
had
never
known
and
he's
about
to
retire
any
place
where
it
could
be
held
under
these
circumstances
for
such
a
protracted
period
of
time.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
in
this
lockup.
and
he
also
testified
that
he
locked
him
in,
held
for
such
a
protracted
period
of
time
that
they
put
him
in
the
county
jail
that
whenever
they
want
to
use
him
or
interrogate
him
or
for
some
other
purpose
they
transfer
him
back
to
the
overnight
jail.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
it's
a
pretty
large
place
because
it
has
to
accommodate
all
of
the
prisoners
awaiting
trial
in
the
city
courts.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
sir?
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir,
it's
in
the
police
station.
it's
a
police
overnight
lockup
jail.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
the
county
jail
is
right
across
the
street.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
it's
in
the
county
courthouse
and
i
believe
it's
on
the
fourth
floor.
so
when
elmer
davis
was
brought
back
to
the
jail,
he
was
held
for
16
days
and
he
was
interrogated
by
three
shifts
of
policemen.
captain
mccall
testified
that
he
put
his
entire
force
of
29
men
to
investigate
this
case.
however,
the
record
only
the
clo
--
discloses
it
that
about
seven
men
interrogated
him.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
davis
contends
that
this
dispute
of
--
mr.
chief
justice
that
he
contends
that
he
was
interrogated
around
the
clock.
but
they
--
they
don't
--
they
dispute
that.
they
say
they
only
talked
to
him
maybe
seven
or
eight
times.
and
they
contend
that
they
didn't
talk
to
him
about
his
crimes
that
they
were
trying
to
breakdown
some
alibis
and
that
in
itself
trying
to
breakdown
some
alibis,
that
in
itself
would
show
to
the
court
that
they
were
continuously
questioning
him
about
this
crime.
they
took
him
to
canton
in
north
carolina
and
it's
in
the
record.
captain
mccall
testified
that
he
agreed
with
the
other
police
to
take
him
to
a
canton
in
north
carolina
breaking
down
the
alibis
and
made
and
forced,
took
him
out
of
the
jail
with
leg
cuffs
and
handcuffs.
and
after
they've
got
to
canton,
he
was
handcuffed
with
that
--
to
another
officer
walked
19
miles
down
the
railroad
right
away
for
19
--
that's
what
their
--
mr.
fesperman
said.
that
is
19
miles
from
canton
to
asheville,
but
from
one
of
the
outskirts
to
the
other
canton
and
asheville
would
only
take
up
about
14
miles.
but
i
think
this
court
could
have
judicial
notice
that
that's
punishment,
that's
cruel
and
barbarous
punishment.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
well,
they
claimed
that
they
were
trying
to
breakdown
some
alibis
that
he
had
told
them.
that
he
had
--
what
had
happened
to
him
after
he
escaped
from
the
haywood
county
serving
jail
and
they
wanted
to
check
this
advocacy
if
it
was
true
or
untrue.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
that
was
during
the
time
that
he
had
--
he
had
consistently
denied
that
he
have
anything
and
to
do
with
this
murder
and
that
was
therefore
they
got
the
confession.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
i
think
it
was
about
four
or
five
days
before
the
confession
was
obtained.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
i
think
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
well
that's
what
--
that's
what
the
validity
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
no
sir,
i've
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
what
happened
happens.
here's
what
i
actually
think
happened
in
this
case.
i
mean
what
your
interpret
mr.
justice.
they
--
when
they
brought
elmer
they
--
goes
back
from
gaston
county
into
mecklenburg.
captain
mccall
had
already
divulged
the
plaintiff
by
which
he
would
make
this
man
confess.
he
knew
that
he
couldn't
get
a
bill
of
indictment
that
he
would
have
to
be
released
and
so
he
--
this
was
a
planned
thing.
this
was
a
means
of
punishing
davis
breaking
down
his
spirit
and
cause
him
to
confess.
then
this
was
a
--
this
was
a
device
of
punishment
to
pull
a
confession
out
of
davis.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
could
--
i
would
have
to
reject
that
because
i
think
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
i
think
the
record
on
page
110;
the
‘arrest
sheet'
would
contradict
that
because
the
‘arrest
sheet'
was
made
out
in
his
presence.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
and
he's
got
a
notation,
the
re-foy
belle
cooper.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
only
if
you
look
mr.
justice,
if
you
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
it
goes
--
it
said
the
problem
of
that
arrest
sheet
re-foy
belle
cooper.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
re-foy
bell
cooper
who
was
the
murdered
lady.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
that
interim
was
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes,
it
was
made
--
as
soon
as
--
it
immediately
upon
his
being
brought
in
the
police
department.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
the
same
day
and
unusual
thing
about
this
record
on
cross-examination,
each
--
there
were
three
officers
who
had
brought
him
in
from
gaston
county
and
all
three
of
them
denied
that
they
knew
anything
about
the
contents
of
the
‘arrest
sheet'
and
during
the
trial
of
the
case,
after
all
three
officers
denied
anything
about
any
knowledge
of
the
contents
of
the
‘arrest
sheet'
then
captain
mccall
on
prompt
cross-examination
himself
admitted.
and
i
think
that's
on
the
record
at
page
--
your
honors
if
you
will
notice,
if
it
please
the
court
if
you
will
notice
record
page
8
and
9.
now
this
was
the
testimony
that
was
elicited
from
captain
mccall
and
cross-examination.
he
is
the
man
who
is
in-charged
of
this
whole
investigation
and
here's
what
he
says.
“i
don't
know
if
it's
impossible
that
i
could
have
ordered
this
boy
to
be
held
without
privilege
of
communicating
with
his
parents.”
now,
he's
the
man
in-charge.
he's
the
man
who
directs
his
officers
what
to
do.
his
friends
and
relatives
are
held
without
privilege
of
using
the
telephone
or
without
privilege
of
talking
to
anybody.
and
may
it
please
the
court
i
think
the
word
“anybody”
to
mean
lawyers,
relatives,
friends,
or
anybody
who
--
or
everybody
he
might
possibly
contact
to
give
him
some
type
of
assistance.
i
don't
know
whether
i
told
the
jury
or
not
that
i
did
not
do
this.
yes,
i
care.
no,
i
did
not
want
him
to
talk
to
anybody.
that's
the
captain
of
the
[inaudible]
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes,
he
has
followed
with
reason
that
he
--
yes,
mr.
bell
i
know
that
a
prisoner
in
the
state
penal
division
can
see
his
own
people.
let
me
see.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes,
and
he
said
he
was
grade
prisoner
and
he
wasn't
entitled
to
see
anybody
and
that
before
he
would
be
allowed
to
see
anybody
he
would
want
to
get
a
permission
from
the
director
of
prisons.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
that
be
--
that
was
a
critical
stage
in
this
investigation
and
that
he
shouldn't
have
been
denied
counsel
and
it
was
part
of
the
devise
to
ring
coerced
confession
from
him
by
holding
him
in
--
holding
him
in
solitary
confinement
for
16
days.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
now,
the
bottom
part
--
the
first
--
the
top
portion
of
this
‘arrest
sheet'
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
--
was
completed
the
day
he
was
brought
to
charlotte.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
and
the
bottom
part
of
it
was
completed
after
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
the
only
thing
something
was
added
there
as
to
the
disposition
made
in
the
preliminary
hearing.
then
there
that
he
was
charged
with
murder
rape
of
foy
bell
cooper.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
the
bottom
half
and
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes,
october
7th,
1959.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
possibly
the
same
day
or
the
next
day.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
and
that
could
have
been
typographical
error.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
well,
that
we
--
they
--
i
mean
the
circumstances
under
which
he
was
held,
i'm
surprise
that
on
the
basis
there
could
possibly
be
living
to
be.
he
has
been
on
death
row
seven
years,
approximately
seven
years
and
in
connection
with
this
preliminary
hearing
that
he
had
no
--
he
had
no
council
even
then.
no
lawyer
represented
him
at
the
preliminary
hearing
that
they
made
arrangements
themselves
on
the
waver
without
counsel.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
it's
undisputed
mr.
chief
justice
that
when
they
obtained
the
purported
overall
confession
that
they
did
not
tell
him
in
any
event.
they
didn't
advise
him
of
his
right
to
counsel,
any
privilege
that
the
constitution
would
be
--
make
available
to
him.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
but
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
but
in
order
to
legalize
this
thing
when
they
wrote
it
down
which
davis
couldn't
read,
he
didn't
know
what
they
were
writing,
when
they
wrote
it
down
then
they're
ready
to
transcribe
it.
then
they
advised
him
of
his
constitution
rights.
he
had
no
advice
when
he
made
the
oral
statement.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
not
--
not
until
the
written
statement.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
right
to
remain
silent,
right
to
have
counsel
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
i
go
right
to
talk
to
somebody
or
you're
allowed
here
if
you
wanted
to.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
it's
not
--
they
say
he
didn't
your
honor.
but
after
in
this
case
your
honor
and
the
circumstances
of
under
which
this
man
was
being
held
that
it
was
in
cumber
that
he
--
i
mean
that
he
had
reached
the
point,
that
legal
guidance
was
an
absolute
necessity.
i
believe
too
--
that
he
couldn't
forfeit
his
rights
due
to
his
ignorance
and
not
knowing
what
he
had
avail.
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
he
--
i
think
that
he
should
have
had
a
lawyer
instead.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
the
only
thing
that
they
offered,
they
--
they
put
on
testimony
that
he
--
some
distance
away
from
the
cemetery
where
this
murder
was
committed
that
he
had
been
in
that
vicinity
and
possibly
had
stolen
a
pair
of
shoes
from
someone.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
they
did
offer
testimony
that
he
had
been
in
that
vicinity
sometime
when
–
in
close
proximity
when
to
which
--
to
when
--
when
the
murder
was
committed
and
has
stolen
a
pair
of
shoes
from
somebody
who
was
asleep.
but
he
--
he
testified
that
this
man
that
he
took
the
shoes
from
was
some
distance
away
from
the
cemetery.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
all
the
circumstances
in
this
case
were
careful
perusal
of
the
facts
would
show
that
this
man
had
volunteered
until
the
minute
that
--
that
this
was
a
conceived
plan
to
ring
confession
out
of
this
man.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes.
they
claimed
that
one
man
testified
and
that's
the
disad
--
that's
the
great
disadvantage
about
confessions.
and
the
police,
all
of
the
police
testified
against
one
man
and
one
day
they
had
this
preacher
there
and
he
testified
that
he
talked
to
him
and
that
he
said
he
had
been
treated
alright.
and
it
would
elicited
on
cross
examination
from
this
minister
that
he
is
what
--
he
had
testified
in
many
cases
of
this
kind.
he's
always
at
hand
there
when
the
police
needs
him
and
there's
a
funny
thing,
he
never
showed
up
until
he
signed
the
confession
and
he
testifies
in
many
cases
of
this
kind
and
that
was
elicited
from
him
on
cross
examination.
he
is
what
you
call
as
handy
uncle
tom.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
well,
he
never
would
say
that.
he
just
claims
he
just
happened
to
be
there.
he's
always
--
mr.
chief
justice,
happens
to
be
when
he
has
given
the
police
department
assistance.
he
happens
to
always
be
there
when
they
need
him.
and
they
never
--
they
didn't
need
him
in
this
case
until
they
had
a
written
confession
from
elmer
davis.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
police
department
wanted
to
do
right
about
it,
they
would
have
headed
there
before
he
signs
that
paper
and
had
him
talk
to
him
and
he
could
have
told
exactly
what
happened.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
well,
the
deputy
sheriff
said
that
i
think
he
testified
that
he
talked
to
elmer
and
that
he
had
made
a
prayer
--
said
a
prayer
--
say
to
ask
him
had
it
been
for
him.
he
solely
stated
he
saw
a
bible
in
his
hand
and
then
elmer
told
him
he
didn't
know
how
to
pray
and
so
--
then
he
made
a
prayer
for
him.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
that
never
came
out
in
the
evidence.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
and
i
think
it's
a
customary
thing
around
the
jail,
they
give
people
bibles.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
your
honor
this
case
i
think
it
had
as
much
action
as
any
case
i've
ever
known.
we
--
we
tried
the
case
in
[inaudible]
called
mecklenburg
county.
we
lost
it,
the
death
sentence
was
imposed.
we
had
it
reviewed
by
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
and
they
affirmed
it.
then
we
filed
a
petition
for
cert
to
this
court
and
it
was
denied.
then
we
went
into
the
eastern
district
court
of
north
carolina
with
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
it
was
denied
in
which
in
the
petition
we
requested
a
hearing.
then
it
went
to
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
it
was
not.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
then
it
went
to
fourth
circuit
and
it
was
argued
before
the
three-judge
court
then
they
requested
reargument
en
banc
and
they
reversed
it
and
sent
it
back
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
our
hearing.
then
that
the
whole
case
was
tried
over
again
before
the
united
states
district
judge
and
he
denied
the
petition.
then
it
went
back
on
appeal
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
argued
before
a
three-judge
court
again.
and
before
any
decision
was
passed,
was
imposed
or
rendered,
they
wrote
to
attorney
general's
office
and
mr.
levin's
and
me
and
asked
“would
we
consent
for
the
record
to
be
reviewed
en
banc
for
a
disposition
and
they
disposed
of
it
on
a
three-judge,
3-2
decision.
then
since
you
asked
that
question,
may
i
state
this.
that
that
was
to
my
--
to
my
mind
i've
been
thinking
about
and
i
think
i
don't'
understand
it.
the
original
three
judges
who
heard
the
case,
two
of
them
dissented,
judge
sobeloff
and
judge
bell.
and
the
thing
i
can't
understand
is
why
they
couldn't
vote
for
--
vote
to
grant
this
petition
instead
of
requesting
that
it
be
decided
en
banc
on
the
record
because
they
would
--
the
dissenting
judges
it
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
that's
right.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
no
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
view
the
record
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
elmer
davis,
the
petitioner,
contends
that
his
petition
for
writ
of
the
habeas
corpus
should
be
granted.
this
case
has
been
in
the
litigation
for
nearly
seven
years
and
elmer
davis,
a
35,
now
35,
i
believe
he
was
about
29
when
this
case
started,
is
in
the
state
present
at
riley
on
death
row.
we
say
we
are
--
i
believe
the
state
would
even
admit
this
that
this
case
stands
or
falls
with
this
confession.
what
i
mean
by
that?
that
the
only
evidence
that
could
possibly
could
link
davis
with
this
murder
is
the
confession,
that's
the
only
thing
in
this
case.
now
if
you
have
notice
on
the
record
page
110,
that
he
was
arrested
by
the
charlotte
police
on
september
the
21,
1959.
they
went
over
there
and
arrested
him.
they
brought
him
back
to
charlotte
and
in
his
presence
they
made
out
that
arrest
sheet.
don't
let
him
use
the
telephone,
don't
let
him
call
anybody,
and
hold
for
hucks
and
fesperman
re
-
foy
bell
cooper,
that's
the
remedy.
so
he
was
arrested
right
there
in
belmont
in
the
police
station.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes,
he
had
--
he
escaped
from
haywood
county
prison
camp.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
well
they
say
that
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
well
what
we
contend
in
this
case
that
the
charlotte
police
department
went
to
belmont
and
the
record
where
arrest
sheet
solely
indicates
it
and
arrested
him
in
belmont,
north
carolina
which
is
another
county
and
brought
him
back
into
gaston
for
the
crime
or
killing
and
murdering
the
white
lady,
mrs.
foy
bell
cooper.
then
--
and
we
say
that
this
--
the
arrest
sheet
and
be
--
our
points
in
this
case
that
he
was
denied,
one,
he
was
denied
counsel
and
number
two
that
all
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
point
unerringly
that
this
is
of
course
confession
that
it
wasn't
voluntarily
given
by
davis.
and
if
you
--
the
careful
perusal
of
the
fact
presented
by
this
record
in
this
case
would
indicate
that
it
was
coerced
that
they
used
force
and
that
would
--
it
was
involuntarily
obtained.
it's
admitted
davis
is
an
illiterate
man
who
couldn't
read
and
write.
when
they
brought
him
back
to
charlotte
and
still
no
place
i
mean
placing
him
in
the
county
jail,
they
put
him
in
the
police
lockup.
he
was
held
in
solitary
confinement
and
held
incommunicado
for
16
days.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
no
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
by
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
no
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
does
not
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
well
he
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
what's
the
difference
--
the
difference
is
your
honor,
when
a
man
escapes
from
prison
he
violates
the
law
there.
he
violates
the
law
in
the
county
in
which
the
prison
is
located.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
then
he
is
returned
to
prison.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
that's
right.
but
instead
of
that
--
that
it
be
done
--
be
in
this
case,
the
charlotte
police
department
went
into
another
county
and
arrested
him
for
this
murder
which
the
pol
--
the
‘arrest
sheet'
indicates
and
held
him
in
an
overnight
jail
for
16
days.
we
say
and
contend
that
the
charlotte
overnight
jail
isn't
an
extension
of
the
prison
system
of
north
carolina
that
he
was
held
as
a
primary
suspect
arrested
and
held
incommunicado
in
an
overnight
jail
for
16
days.
and
it's
admitted
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
we
would
return
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
they
--
we
return
him
to
the
prison
camp.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
–
police
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
sir?
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
and
i
understand
it's
in
the
record
that
captain
mccall
after
having
gone
over
there
and
having
gotten
in
and
have
them
arrested
him
and
largely
and
in
this
lockup
did
get
permission
from
the
director
of
prisons
to
investigate
this
crime.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
the
overnight
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
the
county
jail
is
right
across
the
street.
it's
within
--
one
street
separates
it
and
we
have
it
in
the
records
here
that
--
it's
in
the
record
that
one
officer
testifying
that
he
had
never
known
and
he's
about
to
retire
any
place
where
it
could
be
held
under
these
circumstances
for
such
a
protracted
period
of
time.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
in
this
lockup.
and
he
also
testified
that
he
locked
him
in,
held
for
such
a
protracted
period
of
time
that
they
put
him
in
the
county
jail
that
whenever
they
want
to
use
him
or
interrogate
him
or
for
some
other
purpose
they
transfer
him
back
to
the
overnight
jail.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
it's
a
pretty
large
place
because
it
has
to
accommodate
all
of
the
prisoners
awaiting
trial
in
the
city
courts.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
sir?
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir,
it's
in
the
police
station.
it's
a
police
overnight
lockup
jail.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
the
county
jail
is
right
across
the
street.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
it's
in
the
county
courthouse
and
i
believe
it's
on
the
fourth
floor.
so
when
elmer
davis
was
brought
back
to
the
jail,
he
was
held
for
16
days
and
he
was
interrogated
by
three
shifts
of
policemen.
captain
mccall
testified
that
he
put
his
entire
force
of
29
men
to
investigate
this
case.
however,
the
record
only
the
clo
--
discloses
it
that
about
seven
men
interrogated
him.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
davis
contends
that
this
dispute
of
--
mr.
chief
justice
that
he
contends
that
he
was
interrogated
around
the
clock.
but
they
--
they
don't
--
they
dispute
that.
they
say
they
only
talked
to
him
maybe
seven
or
eight
times.
and
they
contend
that
they
didn't
talk
to
him
about
his
crimes
that
they
were
trying
to
breakdown
some
alibis
and
that
in
itself
trying
to
breakdown
some
alibis,
that
in
itself
would
show
to
the
court
that
they
were
continuously
questioning
him
about
this
crime.
they
took
him
to
canton
in
north
carolina
and
it's
in
the
record.
captain
mccall
testified
that
he
agreed
with
the
other
police
to
take
him
to
a
canton
in
north
carolina
breaking
down
the
alibis
and
made
and
forced,
took
him
out
of
the
jail
with
leg
cuffs
and
handcuffs.
and
after
they've
got
to
canton,
he
was
handcuffed
with
that
--
to
another
officer
walked
19
miles
down
the
railroad
right
away
for
19
--
that's
what
their
--
mr.
fesperman
said.
that
is
19
miles
from
canton
to
asheville,
but
from
one
of
the
outskirts
to
the
other
canton
and
asheville
would
only
take
up
about
14
miles.
but
i
think
this
court
could
have
judicial
notice
that
that's
punishment,
that's
cruel
and
barbarous
punishment.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
well,
they
claimed
that
they
were
trying
to
breakdown
some
alibis
that
he
had
told
them.
that
he
had
--
what
had
happened
to
him
after
he
escaped
from
the
haywood
county
serving
jail
and
they
wanted
to
check
this
advocacy
if
it
was
true
or
untrue.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
that
was
during
the
time
that
he
had
--
he
had
consistently
denied
that
he
have
anything
and
to
do
with
this
murder
and
that
was
therefore
they
got
the
confession.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
i
think
it
was
about
four
or
five
days
before
the
confession
was
obtained.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
i
think
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
well
that's
what
--
that's
what
the
validity
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
no
sir,
i've
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
what
happened
happens.
here's
what
i
actually
think
happened
in
this
case.
i
mean
what
your
interpret
mr.
justice.
they
--
when
they
brought
elmer
they
--
goes
back
from
gaston
county
into
mecklenburg.
captain
mccall
had
already
divulged
the
plaintiff
by
which
he
would
make
this
man
confess.
he
knew
that
he
couldn't
get
a
bill
of
indictment
that
he
would
have
to
be
released
and
so
he
--
this
was
a
planned
thing.
this
was
a
means
of
punishing
davis
breaking
down
his
spirit
and
cause
him
to
confess.
then
this
was
a
--
this
was
a
device
of
punishment
to
pull
a
confession
out
of
davis.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
could
--
i
would
have
to
reject
that
because
i
think
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
i
think
the
record
on
page
110;
the
‘arrest
sheet'
would
contradict
that
because
the
‘arrest
sheet'
was
made
out
in
his
presence.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
and
he's
got
a
notation,
the
re-foy
belle
cooper.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
only
if
you
look
mr.
justice,
if
you
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
it
goes
--
it
said
the
problem
of
that
arrest
sheet
re-foy
belle
cooper.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
re-foy
bell
cooper
who
was
the
murdered
lady.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
that
interim
was
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes,
it
was
made
--
as
soon
as
--
it
immediately
upon
his
being
brought
in
the
police
department.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
the
same
day
and
unusual
thing
about
this
record
on
cross-examination,
each
--
there
were
three
officers
who
had
brought
him
in
from
gaston
county
and
all
three
of
them
denied
that
they
knew
anything
about
the
contents
of
the
‘arrest
sheet'
and
during
the
trial
of
the
case,
after
all
three
officers
denied
anything
about
any
knowledge
of
the
contents
of
the
‘arrest
sheet'
then
captain
mccall
on
prompt
cross-examination
himself
admitted.
and
i
think
that's
on
the
record
at
page
--
your
honors
if
you
will
notice,
if
it
please
the
court
if
you
will
notice
record
page
8
and
9.
now
this
was
the
testimony
that
was
elicited
from
captain
mccall
and
cross-examination.
he
is
the
man
who
is
in-charged
of
this
whole
investigation
and
here's
what
he
says.
“i
don't
know
if
it's
impossible
that
i
could
have
ordered
this
boy
to
be
held
without
privilege
of
communicating
with
his
parents.”
now,
he's
the
man
in-charge.
he's
the
man
who
directs
his
officers
what
to
do.
his
friends
and
relatives
are
held
without
privilege
of
using
the
telephone
or
without
privilege
of
talking
to
anybody.
and
may
it
please
the
court
i
think
the
word
“anybody”
to
mean
lawyers,
relatives,
friends,
or
anybody
who
--
or
everybody
he
might
possibly
contact
to
give
him
some
type
of
assistance.
i
don't
know
whether
i
told
the
jury
or
not
that
i
did
not
do
this.
yes,
i
care.
no,
i
did
not
want
him
to
talk
to
anybody.
that's
the
captain
of
the
[inaudible]
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes,
he
has
followed
with
reason
that
he
--
yes,
mr.
bell
i
know
that
a
prisoner
in
the
state
penal
division
can
see
his
own
people.
let
me
see.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes,
and
he
said
he
was
grade
prisoner
and
he
wasn't
entitled
to
see
anybody
and
that
before
he
would
be
allowed
to
see
anybody
he
would
want
to
get
a
permission
from
the
director
of
prisons.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
that
be
--
that
was
a
critical
stage
in
this
investigation
and
that
he
shouldn't
have
been
denied
counsel
and
it
was
part
of
the
devise
to
ring
coerced
confession
from
him
by
holding
him
in
--
holding
him
in
solitary
confinement
for
16
days.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
now,
the
bottom
part
--
the
first
--
the
top
portion
of
this
‘arrest
sheet'
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
--
was
completed
the
day
he
was
brought
to
charlotte.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
and
the
bottom
part
of
it
was
completed
after
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
the
only
thing
something
was
added
there
as
to
the
disposition
made
in
the
preliminary
hearing.
then
there
that
he
was
charged
with
murder
rape
of
foy
bell
cooper.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
the
bottom
half
and
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes,
october
7th,
1959.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
possibly
the
same
day
or
the
next
day.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
and
that
could
have
been
typographical
error.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
well,
that
we
--
they
--
i
mean
the
circumstances
under
which
he
was
held,
i'm
surprise
that
on
the
basis
there
could
possibly
be
living
to
be.
he
has
been
on
death
row
seven
years,
approximately
seven
years
and
in
connection
with
this
preliminary
hearing
that
he
had
no
--
he
had
no
council
even
then.
no
lawyer
represented
him
at
the
preliminary
hearing
that
they
made
arrangements
themselves
on
the
waver
without
counsel.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
it's
undisputed
mr.
chief
justice
that
when
they
obtained
the
purported
overall
confession
that
they
did
not
tell
him
in
any
event.
they
didn't
advise
him
of
his
right
to
counsel,
any
privilege
that
the
constitution
would
be
--
make
available
to
him.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
but
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
but
in
order
to
legalize
this
thing
when
they
wrote
it
down
which
davis
couldn't
read,
he
didn't
know
what
they
were
writing,
when
they
wrote
it
down
then
they're
ready
to
transcribe
it.
then
they
advised
him
of
his
constitution
rights.
he
had
no
advice
when
he
made
the
oral
statement.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
not
--
not
until
the
written
statement.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
right
to
remain
silent,
right
to
have
counsel
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
i
go
right
to
talk
to
somebody
or
you're
allowed
here
if
you
wanted
to.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
it's
not
--
they
say
he
didn't
your
honor.
but
after
in
this
case
your
honor
and
the
circumstances
of
under
which
this
man
was
being
held
that
it
was
in
cumber
that
he
--
i
mean
that
he
had
reached
the
point,
that
legal
guidance
was
an
absolute
necessity.
i
believe
too
--
that
he
couldn't
forfeit
his
rights
due
to
his
ignorance
and
not
knowing
what
he
had
avail.
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
he
--
i
think
that
he
should
have
had
a
lawyer
instead.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
the
only
thing
that
they
offered,
they
--
they
put
on
testimony
that
he
--
some
distance
away
from
the
cemetery
where
this
murder
was
committed
that
he
had
been
in
that
vicinity
and
possibly
had
stolen
a
pair
of
shoes
from
someone.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
they
did
offer
testimony
that
he
had
been
in
that
vicinity
sometime
when
–
in
close
proximity
when
to
which
--
to
when
--
when
the
murder
was
committed
and
has
stolen
a
pair
of
shoes
from
somebody
who
was
asleep.
but
he
--
he
testified
that
this
man
that
he
took
the
shoes
from
was
some
distance
away
from
the
cemetery.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
all
the
circumstances
in
this
case
were
careful
perusal
of
the
facts
would
show
that
this
man
had
volunteered
until
the
minute
that
--
that
this
was
a
conceived
plan
to
ring
confession
out
of
this
man.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes.
they
claimed
that
one
man
testified
and
that's
the
disad
--
that's
the
great
disadvantage
about
confessions.
and
the
police,
all
of
the
police
testified
against
one
man
and
one
day
they
had
this
preacher
there
and
he
testified
that
he
talked
to
him
and
that
he
said
he
had
been
treated
alright.
and
it
would
elicited
on
cross
examination
from
this
minister
that
he
is
what
--
he
had
testified
in
many
cases
of
this
kind.
he's
always
at
hand
there
when
the
police
needs
him
and
there's
a
funny
thing,
he
never
showed
up
until
he
signed
the
confession
and
he
testifies
in
many
cases
of
this
kind
and
that
was
elicited
from
him
on
cross
examination.
he
is
what
you
call
as
handy
uncle
tom.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
well,
he
never
would
say
that.
he
just
claims
he
just
happened
to
be
there.
he's
always
--
mr.
chief
justice,
happens
to
be
when
he
has
given
the
police
department
assistance.
he
happens
to
always
be
there
when
they
need
him.
and
they
never
--
they
didn't
need
him
in
this
case
until
they
had
a
written
confession
from
elmer
davis.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
police
department
wanted
to
do
right
about
it,
they
would
have
headed
there
before
he
signs
that
paper
and
had
him
talk
to
him
and
he
could
have
told
exactly
what
happened.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
well,
the
deputy
sheriff
said
that
i
think
he
testified
that
he
talked
to
elmer
and
that
he
had
made
a
prayer
--
said
a
prayer
--
say
to
ask
him
had
it
been
for
him.
he
solely
stated
he
saw
a
bible
in
his
hand
and
then
elmer
told
him
he
didn't
know
how
to
pray
and
so
--
then
he
made
a
prayer
for
him.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
that
never
came
out
in
the
evidence.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
and
i
think
it's
a
customary
thing
around
the
jail,
they
give
people
bibles.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
your
honor
this
case
i
think
it
had
as
much
action
as
any
case
i've
ever
known.
we
--
we
tried
the
case
in
[inaudible]
called
mecklenburg
county.
we
lost
it,
the
death
sentence
was
imposed.
we
had
it
reviewed
by
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
and
they
affirmed
it.
then
we
filed
a
petition
for
cert
to
this
court
and
it
was
denied.
then
we
went
into
the
eastern
district
court
of
north
carolina
with
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
it
was
denied
in
which
in
the
petition
we
requested
a
hearing.
then
it
went
to
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
it
was
not.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
then
it
went
to
fourth
circuit
and
it
was
argued
before
the
three-judge
court
then
they
requested
reargument
en
banc
and
they
reversed
it
and
sent
it
back
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
our
hearing.
then
that
the
whole
case
was
tried
over
again
before
the
united
states
district
judge
and
he
denied
the
petition.
then
it
went
back
on
appeal
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
argued
before
a
three-judge
court
again.
and
before
any
decision
was
passed,
was
imposed
or
rendered,
they
wrote
to
attorney
general's
office
and
mr.
levin's
and
me
and
asked
“would
we
consent
for
the
record
to
be
reviewed
en
banc
for
a
disposition
and
they
disposed
of
it
on
a
three-judge,
3-2
decision.
then
since
you
asked
that
question,
may
i
state
this.
that
that
was
to
my
--
to
my
mind
i've
been
thinking
about
and
i
think
i
don't'
understand
it.
the
original
three
judges
who
heard
the
case,
two
of
them
dissented,
judge
sobeloff
and
judge
bell.
and
the
thing
i
can't
understand
is
why
they
couldn't
vote
for
--
vote
to
grant
this
petition
instead
of
requesting
that
it
be
decided
en
banc
on
the
record
because
they
would
--
the
dissenting
judges
it
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
that's
right.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
no
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
bell
view
the
record
--
mr.
charles
v.
bell
yes
sir.
