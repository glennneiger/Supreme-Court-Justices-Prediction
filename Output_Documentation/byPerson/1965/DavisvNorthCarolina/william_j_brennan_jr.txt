j.
brennan,

well,
mr.
bell
he
escaped
from
a
prison
camp,
was
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
ordinarily
on
--
being
recaptured
where
would
they
return
him,
to
the
prison
camp?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
in
the
prison
camp?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
point
is
instead
of
doing
that
they
took
him
to
a
police
station
or
police
county
jail,
was
that
in
charlotte?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
where
they
kept
him
--
you
say
interrogated
for
16
days?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
not
in
connection
with
his
escape
but
only
in
connection
with
his
alleged
murders,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
lockup?
just
to
keep
him
in
the
cell
within
a
police
station
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
gave
any
reason,
did
he?
he
followed
with
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
your
point
is
that
that
might
be
alright
and
at
least
that's
not
what
it
is
because
they
returned
him
from
the
prison
from
which
he
escaped.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
when
they
brought
him
in
solely
to
interrogate
him
that
they
couldn't
do
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

when
did

record,
he
was
being
held
only

connection
with
the
murder,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
mean
there's
no
reference
here
that
was
being
held
on
charlotte
for
any
of
these
evidences.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the

testify

advised
him
that
he
might
see
someone,
that
he
might
see
a
lawyer
or
that

might
make
a
telephone
call
that
he
didn't
have
to
talk

if
they
did
what
did
they
advise
him
