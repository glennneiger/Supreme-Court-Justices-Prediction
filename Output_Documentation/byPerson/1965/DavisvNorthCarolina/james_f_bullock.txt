mr.
james
f.
bullock
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices.
mr.
bell
was
been
with
this
case
all
the
way
through
and
i
got
in
on
the
very
end
of
it,
several
members
of
our
office
having
handled
it
previously.
the
question
before
this
court
is
not
a
new
question.
however
the
ascertainment
of
the
answer
by
placing
all
the
facts
of
this
case
within
the
applicable
law
was
enunciated
by
this
court,
it's
difficult
as
always,
we
realized
that.
if
i
may
add
a
personal
note,
the
case
is
difficult
for
me
there
are
two
reasons.
first,
i
do
not
approve
of
capital
punishment.
second,
it's
the
first
case
i
have
ever
appeared
in
which
the
death
sentence
had
been
imposed
and
i
was
on
this
side
of
defense
that
i
--
i've
always
been
a
defense
counsel
previously.
now,
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
the
attorney
general's
office
is
not
vindictive,
not
blood
thirsty.
it
has
been
our
practice
as
mr.
bell
well
knows
during
the
years
that
i
have
been
there
that
we
concede
error
very
frequently
in
criminal
cases
in
both
the
state
and
the
federal
courts
when
there's
been
violation
of
due
process
or
error
of
law.
yet,
i
have
a
duty
to
the
public
of
north
carolina
and
i
have
a
profound
respect
for
the
law
and
we
feel
that
when
all
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case
have
been
considered,
that
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
will
be
affirmed
finding
that
there
had
not
--
had
not
been
a
violation
of
due
process.
mr.
bell
in
response
to
your
question,
we
did
some
of
the
history
of
this
case.
it
has
been
a
long
case.
it's
been
in
litigation
ever
since
1959.
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
was
considered
by
the
trial
judge
in
the
superior
court
and
resolved
against
the
defendant.
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
resolved
a
question
against
the
defendant.
this
court
denied
certiorari.
it
was
judge
butler
the
first
time
in
the
district
court
in
that
circumstance,
i
was
not
within,
found
the
facts
against
the
defendant.
it
went
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
they
felt
that
a
plenary
hearing
should
be
held
and
a
plenary
was
held
in
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
eastern
district
which
was
a
trial
de
novo.
in
fact,
every
witness
involved
so
far
as
this
confession
is
concerned
in
material
was
heard
by
the
district
court
plus
additional
three
witnesses
who
were
not
heard
in
the
superior
court.
and
i
might
say
that
the
state
allowed
mr.
bell
to
lead
his
client
and
his
witnesses
anyway
they
wanted
to
go
because
we
had
no
hesitation
in
letting
the
full
facts
come
out
in
that
court.
now,
we
had
not
planned
to
argue
the
facts
of
this
case
in
detail
because
we
think
that
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
the
findings
of
the
fourth
circuit
sufficiently
deal
with
the
facts
and
then
prior
to
law
thereto
and
it
would
be
somewhat
of
a
wasted
time
for
us
to
review
them
again
here.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
what
mr.
bell
said
he
felt
had
happened
that
this
was
a
planned
thing
from
the
beginning
when
the
police
first
took
davis
into
custody.
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
was
taken
into
custody
in
belmont
the
night
or
the
day
after
the
murder
and
i
see
no
way
that
the
police
could
have
planned
anything
against
davis
because
they
didn't
know
who
had
committed
the
murder.
now,
on
davis'
person
when
he
was
arrested
was
a
pocketbook,
identification
cards
from
bishel
hayes
whom
he
had
robbed
the
day
of
the
murder
within
a
few
yards
of
the
cemetery
where
the
murder
occurred.
now
that
is
why
the
charlotte
police
went
to
belmont
and
brought
him
back.
the
belmont
police
contacted
the
charlotte
police
as
they
always
do
when
they
pick
up
an
escaped
convict
and
let
them
know
he
has
been
apprehended.
in
addition
to
that
he
had
on
this
person
various
other
articles
which
he
had
stolen.
he
had
broken
into
homes
and
stolen
ladies
pants.
he
had
stolen
these
items
off
on
clotheslines
on
his
trip
down
from
the
mountains
coming
in
to
charlotte.
he
would
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
sir?
mr.
james
f.
bullock
i
have
not
been
able
to
pinpoint
from
the
record
the
exact
time
of
the
escape
this
case,
but
it's
indicated
it
was
some
days
prior
to
his
apprehension
and
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
i
think
so,
yes
sir.
i
don't
believe
he
ever
said
the
exact
day.
it
shows
that
he
–
it
indicates
that
it
was
several
days
prior
to
his
apprehension
and
the
murder
in
charlotte
because
he
had
come
down
by
train
and
he
said
by
bus
and
other
means
from
up
in
the
mountains.
and
this
route
from
campton
to
ashville
is
where
he
told
the
police
very
freely,
he
admitted
this
in
the
superior
court,
admitted
it
in
the
district
court
that
he
had
broken
into
these
homes.
that
he
had
committed
this
robbery
although
he
said
it
was
on
saturday
instead
of
sunday
the
day
of
murder.
he
pretty
admitted
all
of
these.
he
said
he
had
always
freely
omitted
his
crimes.
the
statement
is
in
the
record
which
he
had
committed,
but
the
charlotte
police
had
ample
reason
to
investigate
this
suspect,
this
escaped
convict
of
all
these
other
crimes
and
a
crime
which
was
committed
in
charlotte,
a
robbery
of
a
--
from
the
person
there.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
he
admitted
though,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
freely,
he
admitted
that
under
oath
in
the
superior
court,
he
admitted
that
under
oath
in
the
district
court.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
oh,
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
he
admitted
on
--
during
this
period
of
time,
the
16
days.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
day
he
first
admitted
thought
but
that
was
what
they
were
interrogating
him
about
during
this
time.
the
cooper
murder
was
not
mentioned
to
him
until
october
the
3rd
i
believe.
he
was
first
brought
to
charlotte
on
september
the
21st,
the
night.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
no
sir,
there
was
not,
nothing
on
his
person
that
connected
him
with
it
because
the
items
of
her
personal
property
had
been
left
in
the
cemetery
and
davis
later
showed
where
he
had
hidden
those
articles
in
the
bushes,
pocketbook,
glasses,
things
of
those.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
this
notation
which
is
on
here
indicates
that
sometime
he
was
held
in
connection
with
this
case
for
questioning
there.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
no
sir.
there's
no
charges
remained
at
that
time
because
there's
no
actual
formal
charge
made
in
this
case
against
davis
until
after
his
confession
and
then
a
warrant
was
issued
and
he
was
--
had
a
preliminary
hearing
a
way
of
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
es
sir
that
--
that's
right
there
and
they
did
clear
this
with
the
prison
officials
in
order
to
hold
him
while
they
were
investigating
all
of
these
other
crimes;
the
articles
which
he
had
on
this
person
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
--
and
the
cooper
case
in
the
event
if
there
is
any
connection
there.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes,
your
honor
not
on
my
explanation,
but
the
record
does
not
indicate
when
that
notation
was
put
on
there
that
you
will
note
from
the
reading
of
the
record
that
the
arresting
officers
or
the
least
the
ones
who
went
to
belmont
and
brought
him
back,
said
they
said
they
did
not
put
that
on
there.
they
had
never
had
any
knowledge
on
this
until
the
time
of
the
trial.
the
two
officers
who
were
assigned
to
the
cooper
case
to
investigate
the
cooper
case
said
they
never
put
it
on
there
because
they
were
not
the
arresting
officers
of
course.
they
had
no
occasion
to
--
they
had
no
knowledge
of
this
notation
until
the
time
of
the
trial
in
the
superior
court.
now,
captain
mccall
testified
that
he
may
have
had
it
put
on
there
sometime,
but
apparently
it
was
sometime
after
he
was
put
in
jail
and
not
the
day
of
this
--
original
‘arrest
sheet'
was
made
out.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
i
didn't
know
what
that
--
do
not
know
what
the
procedure
is
in
the
arrest
--
and
the
police
department
shall
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir.
the
--
the
notation
--
we
can't
deny
the
fact
that
the
notation
raises
serious
questions.
however,
all
of
the
evidence
that
the
superior
court
and
the
district
court
indicates
that
this
notation
was
completely
disregarded
by
all
of
the
police
officers,
in
fact,
they
had
no
knowledge
of
it
other
than
captain
mccall
who
said
he
may
have
had
to
put
on
there
--
it
would
be
explanation
concerning
to
being
a
c
grade
prisoner.
now,
the
reason
--
the
evidence
shows
that
it
was
disregarded
immediately
after
david
was
put
into
jail,
i
believe
the
next
day
the
record
indicates,
he
requested
the
jailer,
i
believe,
to
contact
his
sister
by
telephone.
they
looked
in
the
directory
and
could
not
find
her
address.
it
must
be
remembered
that
his
sister
had
not
seen
davis
for
10
to
15
years,
she
testified.
so
apparently,
he
did
not
know
exactly
who
she
was
so
they
were
having
some
difficulty
in
locating
in
the
directory.
but
mr.
hucks
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
she
lives
in
charlotte
yes
sir,
near
the
cemetery
where
this
murder
occurred.
in
fact
davis'
home
was
near
the
cemetery
where
this
murder
occurred
and
i
believe
it
was
in
evidence
that
one
of
his
parents
has
killed
the
other
parent
while
davis
was
a
youngster.
and
the
police
knew
him
and
his
background
for
that
reason
for
more
investigation
with
that
and
his
other
crimes.
but
mr.
hucks,
a
detective,
when
davis
says
time
after
time,
he
treated
him
very
nice
that
he
was
assigned
to
the
case
never
mistreated
him
in
any
form
of
fashion.
mr.
hucks
went
out
and
made
a
search
and
found
the
sister
and
told
him
that
davis
wanted
to
see
her.
and
she
said,
i
think
she
had
seven
or
ten
kids,
something
like,
who
were
sick.
she
said
she
couldn't
come
then
because
of
the
children.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
that
was
a
day
or
two
after
davis
had
been
arrested.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir
and
after
he
was
brought
back
to
belmont.
and
then
a
few
days
later
mr.
porter
asked
davis
whether
there
was
any
one
he
wanted
to
contact
and
he
mentioned
that
his
sister
had
not
come
and
he
wanted
to
see
her.
he
started
to
located
the
sister
and
found
that
mr.
hucks
had
already
had
and
did
not
proceed
any
further.
but
mr.
hucks
and
mr.
garner
who
lived
next
door
to
the
davis
home
--
old
davis
home
out
there
went
over
and
talked
to
the
sister
a
second
time
and
she
still
did
not
come.
now,
all
the
officers
say
that
she'd
never
once
came
to
the
city
jail
to
see
davis.
she
said
that
she
did
go
over
to
the
county
jail
to
see
him
at
one
time,
but
it's
significant
that
she
didn't
even
bother
to
go
to
his
trial.
it
is
further
significant
that
neither
mr.
bell
nor
mr.
avins
or
her
attorneys
nor
the
sister
nor
davis
considered
this
testimony
germane
enough
to
have
at
the
trial
or
at
any
time
until
four
years
later
at
the
plenary
hearing
in
the
district
court.
and
we
just
think
that
the
police
testimony
on
all
of
these
circumstances
as
the
district
court
believed
and
the
circuit
court
believed,
was
more
worthy
than
i
believe
than
the
sister's.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
it
seemed
to
--
but
she
only
testified
and
that
was
in
the
district
court.
there
were
some
conflict
as
to
when
she
was
trying
to
see
him
there.
it
was
not
entirely
clear
on
that.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
excuse
me
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
the
only
explanation
we
have
as
what
captain
mccall
himself
testified
to
there
that
he
was
doing
that
in
order
to
--
or
get
--
that
was
the
instruction
he
had
received
from
the
prison
department.
when
they
--
he
called
about
having
him
and
asked
permission
to
keep
him
up
there.
and
that
--
that
was
a
preference.
but
apparently
none
of
the
police
officers
had
been
instructed
by
captain
mccall
to
argue
anything
about
this
notation.
now,
we
say
that
all
the
evidence
clearly
indicates
that
we
--
we
can't
deny
it
was
there
and
the
fact
if
it
had
been
carried
out
and
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
hold
him
this
way,
the
police
would
have
been
silly
to
kept
this
‘arrest
sheet'
there
for
the
attorneys
to
see.
they
could
easily
destroyed
it
and
fix
that
one.
but
they
say
there
never
was
any
denial
that
davis
seen
anyone
he
wants
--
he
only
requested
to
see
one
person
and
that
was
his
sister.
they
made
two
attempts,
three
counting
the
telephone
trying
to
find
--
to
find
her
and
she
would
not
come.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
the
record
indicates
that
at
least
two
or
three
of
the
police
officers
did
advise
of
him
of
those
general
rights.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
previously,
one
of
them
previously
to
the
confession
and
then
at
the
time
of
the
confession
they
specifically
advised
him
at
that
time
they
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
the
oral
confession.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
that's
oral
confession
and
then
again
at
the
time
of
the
written
confession
captain
mccall
told
him
that
--
advised
him
of
his
rights
that
if
he
wrote
it
and
signed
it,
it
could
be
used
against
him
so
forth
and
so
on.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
this
would
have
been
on
october
the
6th,
i
believe.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
sir?
mr.
james
f.
bullock
he
can
read
your
honor.
the
district
court
found
that
he
had
completed
a
third
of
fourth
grade.
there
was
evidence
that
he
had
a
testament
which
he
had
been
reading
in
the
jail
which
was
given
to
him
by
people
who
visited
the
jail
regularly
to
distribute
these
testaments
and
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
read
this
bible
all
during
his
trial
in
the
superior
court.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes,
i
understand
that
it
was
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
it
was
read
to
davis
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
the
statement
as
i
understand
it
your
honor
was
dictated
by
captain
mccall
and
was
taken
down
by
a
police
reporter
and
with
--
in
the
presence
of
several
other
police
officers,
i
believe
three
or
four
often
that
time
who
witness
davis
signature
--
witnessed,
in
fact
it
was
read
to
him
and
his
signature
to
it.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir.
it
was
read
to
him.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir
i
will.
this
was
i
believe
about
two
weeks
perhaps
after
he
had
--
his
arrest.
detective
hucks
who
was
assigned,
chief
detective
assigned
to
this
took
davis
to
his
home
that
morning
for
breakfast
and
fed
him
a
hot
breakfast
and
then
they
went
out
to
canton
by
an
automobile.
now,
they
kept
leg
chains
on
him
in
the
car,
but
they
took
the
leg
chains
off
of
him
for
the
walk
and
the
officer
handcuffed
davis
to
his
wrist.
and
they
walked
side
by
side
for
the
14
miles
he
testified
from
outskirts
to
outskirts
approximately
14
miles
along
this
way
trying
to
identify
the
homes
into
which
davis
had
broken
to
secure
these
items
which
he
had
in
his
possession
at
the
time
of
his
arrest.
he
wanted
--
he
was
willing
to
go,
the
record
indicates
that.
now
he
wanted
to
clear
up
this
aspect
of
it
and
he
was
willing
to
go.
now,
we
--
we
don't
think
that
davis
suffered
on
that
trip.
if
you
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
no
sir,
he
was
unable
to
point
out
anything
to
him
whatsoever.
he
had
told
him
about
these
various
places
and
described
them
but
they
were
never
able
to
find
any
home
or
any
place
that
he
would
identify
as
a
middle
of
the
tracks.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
no
sir,
it
was
on
the
railroad
line.
he
--
he
had
traveled
the
railroad
coming
down.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
i'm
not
familiar
with
it.
apparently,
not
because
the
other
officer
went
by
car
on
that
to
meet
him
at
the
other
end
where
they
would
come
into
by
rail
where
they
were
walking.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
it
is
not
a
casual
stroll,
i
agree
your
honor
but
if
you
would
--
if
you
knew
the
officer
involved
who
was
short
and
rather
portly
built
compared
to
davis,
the
officer
must
have
suffered
a
great
deal
more.
in
fact
he
testified
that
he
did.
that
it
was
quite
a
chore
for
him
to
get
--
to
survive
as
he
would
say.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir.
he
admitted
this.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir,
he
admitted
that
he
had
come
this
way
himself.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir.
so
he
had
been
this
way
before
walking
and
breaking
into
homes
and
stealing
and
it
didn't
bother
then
so
i
don't
think
this
later
won't
bother
him
at
all.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
no
sir,
he
was
apprehended
in
belmont
which
is
some
miles
out
from
charlotte.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
he's
in
adjoining
counties
few
miles
from
charlotte
and
then
when
the
charlotte
police
learned
that
the
belmont
police
had
him
in
custody
they
went
over
to
get
him
to
charlotte
to
investigate
these
crimes
which
had
happened
in
charlotte.
one,
which
had
been
reported
to
the
robbery
of
hayes;
hayes
came
up
and
reported,
he
had
reported
he
had
been
robbed
and
they
had
the
person's
billfold
and
the
identification
cards
and
all
on
this
person
when
he
was
arrested.
so
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
they
were
investigating
this
and
had
davis
placed
on
sunday
at
the
day
of
the
rape
murder
within
a
very
few
feet
of
the
grave
cemetery
in
which
it
occurred.
in
fact
that
he
had
robbed
hayes
there.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
--
suspect
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir,
there
was
the
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
--
suspicion
at
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
the
officers
testified
that
they
were
investigating
his
backgrounds
and
these
other
crimes
which
he
had
told
them
about.
he
had
told
them
of
several
crimes
which
he
had
committed
since
his
escape.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
well,
i
--
what
i
understood
from
their
testimony
was
the
fact
that
if
in
investigating
these
they
could
place
davis
away
from
charlotte.
he
would
be
exonerated
of
the
crime
in
charlotte.
if
as
he
later
testified
he
was
some
place
else
breaking
into
homes,
committing
another
crime,
and
certainly
it
was
to
his
interest
that
the
charlotte
police
investigate
these
matters
and
attempt
to
find
out
what
had
occurred
and
that
was
the
explanation.
in
fact,
they
were
still
investigating
the
cooper
murder
and
beside
that
they
had
not
been
able
to
tie
in
with
davis
in
any
respect
until
they
asked
him
about
it
and
on
october
the
3rd,
again
on
the
5th,
and
then
on
the
6th
when
a
confession
occurred.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
he
claimed
that
he
was
in
belmont
at
his
auntie's
home.
but
the
auntie
didn't
appear
at
the
trial
and
testified
that
he
was
up
there.
i'd
like
to
say
one
word
about
nathaniel
cross.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
mr.
dr.
nathaniel
cross,
a
colored
pastor
who
testified
at
a
district
court.
they
called
him
uncle
tom.
i
have
never
seen
a
more
dignified
gentleman
in
my
life
than
dr.
cross.
he's
a
--
has
a
doctor's
degree
in
religion.
he's
editor
of
the
newspaper,
radio
commentator,
highly
educated,
very
rounded
person
and
has
fought,
for
many
years,
for
the
rights
of
the
underprivileged
people
particularly
their
constitutional
rights
as
the
record
would
show
in
charlotte
and
surrounding
areas.
he
testified
to
this
fact.
now,
why
did
he
come
to
see
davis?
because
davis
was
standing
and
davis
himself
was
former
member
of
his
church
in
belmont,
he
knew
him
and
when
he
finally
made
the
connection
by
reading
the
newspapers
that
this
was
the
davis
that
had
been
in
his
church
or
his
family,
he
went
down
to
visit
him
and
went
in
and
had
an
hours
of
conference
with
him
at
which
time
davis
admitted
to
him
that
he'd
been
well
treated,
no
mistreatment
by
the
police
officers
that
he
signed
a
confession
voluntarily.
it's
all
in
the
record.
now,
we
don't
like
to
talk
about
people
whose
character
is
known
but
davis
here,
i
have
a
summary
that
i
think
this
points
it
out,
29
years
old,
low
average
intelligence
according
to
the
district
court,
frankly
he
made
an
outstanding
appearance
in
the
district
court
on
the
witness
stand.
he
was
very
calm
and
he's
not
half
as
nervous
as
i
am
here
today,
but
--
and
gave
very
intelligent
answers.
now
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
this
is
davis.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
in
the
federal
district
court.
it's
the
only
time
i
had
ever
seen
him
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
made
a
very
favorable
impression
on
me
as
a
witness.
this
is
the
first
time
i
was
connected
with
the
case.
i
went
back
then
and
got
the
record
in
the
superior
court
which
this
court
had
the
written
--
that
same
record
that
appeared
certiorari,
not
once
in
41
pages
of
testimony
in
the
superior
court
did
davis
say
anything
about
any
mistreatment,
not
once.
but
when
you
get
into
the
district
court
four
years
later,
that's
his
theme
song,
police
beating
and
brutality
relay
after
relay
of
questioning
late
in
to
night,
all
night
long.
he
is
a
phenomenon.
he
has
total
recall
of
details
four
years
later.
he
has
every
component
that
this
court
has
said
was
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
four
years
later,
but
they
don't
have
at
the
original
trial,
they
don't
mention
them.
he's
a
liar
by
his
own
omission
in
the
district
court
by
identifying
an
officer
whom
he
claimed,
said
he
was
going
framed
--
framed,
something
to
that
effect.
in
the
district
court
he
identified
three
different
persons
and
then
finally
ended
up
by
saying
that
he
had
lied
about
detective
sykes
in
the
superior
court
and
you
will
find
inconsistency
after
inconsistency
between
the
two
records,
his
testimony
which
to
me
is
nothing
more
than
his
testimony
in
the
district
court
as
complete
publication,
a
good
story
dreamed
up,
fixed
up,
to
get
a
reversal,
to
save
himself
from
this
penalty
which
has
been
imposed
upon
him.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes,
i
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
we
do
not
deny
the
fact
that
it
was
there
but
we
--
we
do
say
that
all
of
the
evidence
--
a
great
deal
of
evidence
indicates
that
that
was
completely
disregarded
so
far
as
this
prisoner
was
concerned.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes,
yes
it
would.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes,
they
do.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
i
don't
believe
there's
any
omission
that
they
ever
interrogated
him
at
night.
at
that
time
the
detectives
only
worked
until
11
o'clock
at
night.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
i
--
i
check
back
on
it.
i
thought
i
had
--
i
believe
i
mentioned
that
in
my
brief
that
they
had
not
interrogate
him
after
11
o'clock
in
any
event
but
i
went
back
to
the
record
later
and
i
never
could
find
any
testimony
that
he
was
interrogated
at
night
by
the
police
officers.
the
latest
that
i
could
find
was
late
in
the
afternoon
four,
or
five,
six,
seven
o'clock,
something
to
that
nature.
what
time
is
it?
mr.
james
f.
bullock
i
assume
that
he
was
talking
about
the
beating
among
friend,
he
beat
you,
i
think
that's
what
he's
having
reference
to.
i
couldn't
what
word
is
that
whether
he
was
framed
or
fram
or
what
but
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
but
after
we
use
the
time
until
i
think
the
connotation
is
it
--
the
[inaudible]
in
that
respect--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
i
don't
believe
that
we
have
any
other
points
to
make
at
this
time
unless
the
court
has
some
questions.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices.
mr.
bell
was
been
with
this
case
all
the
way
through
and
i
got
in
on
the
very
end
of
it,
several
members
of
our
office
having
handled
it
previously.
the
question
before
this
court
is
not
a
new
question.
however
the
ascertainment
of
the
answer
by
placing
all
the
facts
of
this
case
within
the
applicable
law
was
enunciated
by
this
court,
it's
difficult
as
always,
we
realized
that.
if
i
may
add
a
personal
note,
the
case
is
difficult
for
me
there
are
two
reasons.
first,
i
do
not
approve
of
capital
punishment.
second,
it's
the
first
case
i
have
ever
appeared
in
which
the
death
sentence
had
been
imposed
and
i
was
on
this
side
of
defense
that
i
--
i've
always
been
a
defense
counsel
previously.
now,
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
the
attorney
general's
office
is
not
vindictive,
not
blood
thirsty.
it
has
been
our
practice
as
mr.
bell
well
knows
during
the
years
that
i
have
been
there
that
we
concede
error
very
frequently
in
criminal
cases
in
both
the
state
and
the
federal
courts
when
there's
been
violation
of
due
process
or
error
of
law.
yet,
i
have
a
duty
to
the
public
of
north
carolina
and
i
have
a
profound
respect
for
the
law
and
we
feel
that
when
all
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case
have
been
considered,
that
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
will
be
affirmed
finding
that
there
had
not
--
had
not
been
a
violation
of
due
process.
mr.
bell
in
response
to
your
question,
we
did
some
of
the
history
of
this
case.
it
has
been
a
long
case.
it's
been
in
litigation
ever
since
1959.
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
was
considered
by
the
trial
judge
in
the
superior
court
and
resolved
against
the
defendant.
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
resolved
a
question
against
the
defendant.
this
court
denied
certiorari.
it
was
judge
butler
the
first
time
in
the
district
court
in
that
circumstance,
i
was
not
within,
found
the
facts
against
the
defendant.
it
went
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
they
felt
that
a
plenary
hearing
should
be
held
and
a
plenary
was
held
in
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
eastern
district
which
was
a
trial
de
novo.
in
fact,
every
witness
involved
so
far
as
this
confession
is
concerned
in
material
was
heard
by
the
district
court
plus
additional
three
witnesses
who
were
not
heard
in
the
superior
court.
and
i
might
say
that
the
state
allowed
mr.
bell
to
lead
his
client
and
his
witnesses
anyway
they
wanted
to
go
because
we
had
no
hesitation
in
letting
the
full
facts
come
out
in
that
court.
now,
we
had
not
planned
to
argue
the
facts
of
this
case
in
detail
because
we
think
that
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
the
findings
of
the
fourth
circuit
sufficiently
deal
with
the
facts
and
then
prior
to
law
thereto
and
it
would
be
somewhat
of
a
wasted
time
for
us
to
review
them
again
here.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
what
mr.
bell
said
he
felt
had
happened
that
this
was
a
planned
thing
from
the
beginning
when
the
police
first
took
davis
into
custody.
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
was
taken
into
custody
in
belmont
the
night
or
the
day
after
the
murder
and
i
see
no
way
that
the
police
could
have
planned
anything
against
davis
because
they
didn't
know
who
had
committed
the
murder.
now,
on
davis'
person
when
he
was
arrested
was
a
pocketbook,
identification
cards
from
bishel
hayes
whom
he
had
robbed
the
day
of
the
murder
within
a
few
yards
of
the
cemetery
where
the
murder
occurred.
now
that
is
why
the
charlotte
police
went
to
belmont
and
brought
him
back.
the
belmont
police
contacted
the
charlotte
police
as
they
always
do
when
they
pick
up
an
escaped
convict
and
let
them
know
he
has
been
apprehended.
in
addition
to
that
he
had
on
this
person
various
other
articles
which
he
had
stolen.
he
had
broken
into
homes
and
stolen
ladies
pants.
he
had
stolen
these
items
off
on
clotheslines
on
his
trip
down
from
the
mountains
coming
in
to
charlotte.
he
would
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
sir?
mr.
james
f.
bullock
i
have
not
been
able
to
pinpoint
from
the
record
the
exact
time
of
the
escape
this
case,
but
it's
indicated
it
was
some
days
prior
to
his
apprehension
and
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
i
think
so,
yes
sir.
i
don't
believe
he
ever
said
the
exact
day.
it
shows
that
he
–
it
indicates
that
it
was
several
days
prior
to
his
apprehension
and
the
murder
in
charlotte
because
he
had
come
down
by
train
and
he
said
by
bus
and
other
means
from
up
in
the
mountains.
and
this
route
from
campton
to
ashville
is
where
he
told
the
police
very
freely,
he
admitted
this
in
the
superior
court,
admitted
it
in
the
district
court
that
he
had
broken
into
these
homes.
that
he
had
committed
this
robbery
although
he
said
it
was
on
saturday
instead
of
sunday
the
day
of
murder.
he
pretty
admitted
all
of
these.
he
said
he
had
always
freely
omitted
his
crimes.
the
statement
is
in
the
record
which
he
had
committed,
but
the
charlotte
police
had
ample
reason
to
investigate
this
suspect,
this
escaped
convict
of
all
these
other
crimes
and
a
crime
which
was
committed
in
charlotte,
a
robbery
of
a
--
from
the
person
there.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
he
admitted
though,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
freely,
he
admitted
that
under
oath
in
the
superior
court,
he
admitted
that
under
oath
in
the
district
court.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
oh,
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
he
admitted
on
--
during
this
period
of
time,
the
16
days.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
day
he
first
admitted
thought
but
that
was
what
they
were
interrogating
him
about
during
this
time.
the
cooper
murder
was
not
mentioned
to
him
until
october
the
3rd
i
believe.
he
was
first
brought
to
charlotte
on
september
the
21st,
the
night.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
no
sir,
there
was
not,
nothing
on
his
person
that
connected
him
with
it
because
the
items
of
her
personal
property
had
been
left
in
the
cemetery
and
davis
later
showed
where
he
had
hidden
those
articles
in
the
bushes,
pocketbook,
glasses,
things
of
those.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
this
notation
which
is
on
here
indicates
that
sometime
he
was
held
in
connection
with
this
case
for
questioning
there.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
no
sir.
there's
no
charges
remained
at
that
time
because
there's
no
actual
formal
charge
made
in
this
case
against
davis
until
after
his
confession
and
then
a
warrant
was
issued
and
he
was
--
had
a
preliminary
hearing
a
way
of
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
es
sir
that
--
that's
right
there
and
they
did
clear
this
with
the
prison
officials
in
order
to
hold
him
while
they
were
investigating
all
of
these
other
crimes;
the
articles
which
he
had
on
this
person
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
--
and
the
cooper
case
in
the
event
if
there
is
any
connection
there.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes,
your
honor
not
on
my
explanation,
but
the
record
does
not
indicate
when
that
notation
was
put
on
there
that
you
will
note
from
the
reading
of
the
record
that
the
arresting
officers
or
the
least
the
ones
who
went
to
belmont
and
brought
him
back,
said
they
said
they
did
not
put
that
on
there.
they
had
never
had
any
knowledge
on
this
until
the
time
of
the
trial.
the
two
officers
who
were
assigned
to
the
cooper
case
to
investigate
the
cooper
case
said
they
never
put
it
on
there
because
they
were
not
the
arresting
officers
of
course.
they
had
no
occasion
to
--
they
had
no
knowledge
of
this
notation
until
the
time
of
the
trial
in
the
superior
court.
now,
captain
mccall
testified
that
he
may
have
had
it
put
on
there
sometime,
but
apparently
it
was
sometime
after
he
was
put
in
jail
and
not
the
day
of
this
--
original
‘arrest
sheet'
was
made
out.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
i
didn't
know
what
that
--
do
not
know
what
the
procedure
is
in
the
arrest
--
and
the
police
department
shall
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir.
the
--
the
notation
--
we
can't
deny
the
fact
that
the
notation
raises
serious
questions.
however,
all
of
the
evidence
that
the
superior
court
and
the
district
court
indicates
that
this
notation
was
completely
disregarded
by
all
of
the
police
officers,
in
fact,
they
had
no
knowledge
of
it
other
than
captain
mccall
who
said
he
may
have
had
to
put
on
there
--
it
would
be
explanation
concerning
to
being
a
c
grade
prisoner.
now,
the
reason
--
the
evidence
shows
that
it
was
disregarded
immediately
after
david
was
put
into
jail,
i
believe
the
next
day
the
record
indicates,
he
requested
the
jailer,
i
believe,
to
contact
his
sister
by
telephone.
they
looked
in
the
directory
and
could
not
find
her
address.
it
must
be
remembered
that
his
sister
had
not
seen
davis
for
10
to
15
years,
she
testified.
so
apparently,
he
did
not
know
exactly
who
she
was
so
they
were
having
some
difficulty
in
locating
in
the
directory.
but
mr.
hucks
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
she
lives
in
charlotte
yes
sir,
near
the
cemetery
where
this
murder
occurred.
in
fact
davis'
home
was
near
the
cemetery
where
this
murder
occurred
and
i
believe
it
was
in
evidence
that
one
of
his
parents
has
killed
the
other
parent
while
davis
was
a
youngster.
and
the
police
knew
him
and
his
background
for
that
reason
for
more
investigation
with
that
and
his
other
crimes.
but
mr.
hucks,
a
detective,
when
davis
says
time
after
time,
he
treated
him
very
nice
that
he
was
assigned
to
the
case
never
mistreated
him
in
any
form
of
fashion.
mr.
hucks
went
out
and
made
a
search
and
found
the
sister
and
told
him
that
davis
wanted
to
see
her.
and
she
said,
i
think
she
had
seven
or
ten
kids,
something
like,
who
were
sick.
she
said
she
couldn't
come
then
because
of
the
children.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
that
was
a
day
or
two
after
davis
had
been
arrested.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir
and
after
he
was
brought
back
to
belmont.
and
then
a
few
days
later
mr.
porter
asked
davis
whether
there
was
any
one
he
wanted
to
contact
and
he
mentioned
that
his
sister
had
not
come
and
he
wanted
to
see
her.
he
started
to
located
the
sister
and
found
that
mr.
hucks
had
already
had
and
did
not
proceed
any
further.
but
mr.
hucks
and
mr.
garner
who
lived
next
door
to
the
davis
home
--
old
davis
home
out
there
went
over
and
talked
to
the
sister
a
second
time
and
she
still
did
not
come.
now,
all
the
officers
say
that
she'd
never
once
came
to
the
city
jail
to
see
davis.
she
said
that
she
did
go
over
to
the
county
jail
to
see
him
at
one
time,
but
it's
significant
that
she
didn't
even
bother
to
go
to
his
trial.
it
is
further
significant
that
neither
mr.
bell
nor
mr.
avins
or
her
attorneys
nor
the
sister
nor
davis
considered
this
testimony
germane
enough
to
have
at
the
trial
or
at
any
time
until
four
years
later
at
the
plenary
hearing
in
the
district
court.
and
we
just
think
that
the
police
testimony
on
all
of
these
circumstances
as
the
district
court
believed
and
the
circuit
court
believed,
was
more
worthy
than
i
believe
than
the
sister's.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
it
seemed
to
--
but
she
only
testified
and
that
was
in
the
district
court.
there
were
some
conflict
as
to
when
she
was
trying
to
see
him
there.
it
was
not
entirely
clear
on
that.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
excuse
me
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
the
only
explanation
we
have
as
what
captain
mccall
himself
testified
to
there
that
he
was
doing
that
in
order
to
--
or
get
--
that
was
the
instruction
he
had
received
from
the
prison
department.
when
they
--
he
called
about
having
him
and
asked
permission
to
keep
him
up
there.
and
that
--
that
was
a
preference.
but
apparently
none
of
the
police
officers
had
been
instructed
by
captain
mccall
to
argue
anything
about
this
notation.
now,
we
say
that
all
the
evidence
clearly
indicates
that
we
--
we
can't
deny
it
was
there
and
the
fact
if
it
had
been
carried
out
and
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
hold
him
this
way,
the
police
would
have
been
silly
to
kept
this
‘arrest
sheet'
there
for
the
attorneys
to
see.
they
could
easily
destroyed
it
and
fix
that
one.
but
they
say
there
never
was
any
denial
that
davis
seen
anyone
he
wants
--
he
only
requested
to
see
one
person
and
that
was
his
sister.
they
made
two
attempts,
three
counting
the
telephone
trying
to
find
--
to
find
her
and
she
would
not
come.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
the
record
indicates
that
at
least
two
or
three
of
the
police
officers
did
advise
of
him
of
those
general
rights.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
previously,
one
of
them
previously
to
the
confession
and
then
at
the
time
of
the
confession
they
specifically
advised
him
at
that
time
they
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
the
oral
confession.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
that's
oral
confession
and
then
again
at
the
time
of
the
written
confession
captain
mccall
told
him
that
--
advised
him
of
his
rights
that
if
he
wrote
it
and
signed
it,
it
could
be
used
against
him
so
forth
and
so
on.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
this
would
have
been
on
october
the
6th,
i
believe.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
sir?
mr.
james
f.
bullock
he
can
read
your
honor.
the
district
court
found
that
he
had
completed
a
third
of
fourth
grade.
there
was
evidence
that
he
had
a
testament
which
he
had
been
reading
in
the
jail
which
was
given
to
him
by
people
who
visited
the
jail
regularly
to
distribute
these
testaments
and
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
read
this
bible
all
during
his
trial
in
the
superior
court.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes,
i
understand
that
it
was
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
it
was
read
to
davis
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
the
statement
as
i
understand
it
your
honor
was
dictated
by
captain
mccall
and
was
taken
down
by
a
police
reporter
and
with
--
in
the
presence
of
several
other
police
officers,
i
believe
three
or
four
often
that
time
who
witness
davis
signature
--
witnessed,
in
fact
it
was
read
to
him
and
his
signature
to
it.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir.
it
was
read
to
him.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir
i
will.
this
was
i
believe
about
two
weeks
perhaps
after
he
had
--
his
arrest.
detective
hucks
who
was
assigned,
chief
detective
assigned
to
this
took
davis
to
his
home
that
morning
for
breakfast
and
fed
him
a
hot
breakfast
and
then
they
went
out
to
canton
by
an
automobile.
now,
they
kept
leg
chains
on
him
in
the
car,
but
they
took
the
leg
chains
off
of
him
for
the
walk
and
the
officer
handcuffed
davis
to
his
wrist.
and
they
walked
side
by
side
for
the
14
miles
he
testified
from
outskirts
to
outskirts
approximately
14
miles
along
this
way
trying
to
identify
the
homes
into
which
davis
had
broken
to
secure
these
items
which
he
had
in
his
possession
at
the
time
of
his
arrest.
he
wanted
--
he
was
willing
to
go,
the
record
indicates
that.
now
he
wanted
to
clear
up
this
aspect
of
it
and
he
was
willing
to
go.
now,
we
--
we
don't
think
that
davis
suffered
on
that
trip.
if
you
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
no
sir,
he
was
unable
to
point
out
anything
to
him
whatsoever.
he
had
told
him
about
these
various
places
and
described
them
but
they
were
never
able
to
find
any
home
or
any
place
that
he
would
identify
as
a
middle
of
the
tracks.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
no
sir,
it
was
on
the
railroad
line.
he
--
he
had
traveled
the
railroad
coming
down.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
i'm
not
familiar
with
it.
apparently,
not
because
the
other
officer
went
by
car
on
that
to
meet
him
at
the
other
end
where
they
would
come
into
by
rail
where
they
were
walking.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
it
is
not
a
casual
stroll,
i
agree
your
honor
but
if
you
would
--
if
you
knew
the
officer
involved
who
was
short
and
rather
portly
built
compared
to
davis,
the
officer
must
have
suffered
a
great
deal
more.
in
fact
he
testified
that
he
did.
that
it
was
quite
a
chore
for
him
to
get
--
to
survive
as
he
would
say.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir.
he
admitted
this.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir,
he
admitted
that
he
had
come
this
way
himself.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir.
so
he
had
been
this
way
before
walking
and
breaking
into
homes
and
stealing
and
it
didn't
bother
then
so
i
don't
think
this
later
won't
bother
him
at
all.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
no
sir,
he
was
apprehended
in
belmont
which
is
some
miles
out
from
charlotte.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
he's
in
adjoining
counties
few
miles
from
charlotte
and
then
when
the
charlotte
police
learned
that
the
belmont
police
had
him
in
custody
they
went
over
to
get
him
to
charlotte
to
investigate
these
crimes
which
had
happened
in
charlotte.
one,
which
had
been
reported
to
the
robbery
of
hayes;
hayes
came
up
and
reported,
he
had
reported
he
had
been
robbed
and
they
had
the
person's
billfold
and
the
identification
cards
and
all
on
this
person
when
he
was
arrested.
so
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
they
were
investigating
this
and
had
davis
placed
on
sunday
at
the
day
of
the
rape
murder
within
a
very
few
feet
of
the
grave
cemetery
in
which
it
occurred.
in
fact
that
he
had
robbed
hayes
there.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
--
suspect
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes
sir,
there
was
the
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
--
suspicion
at
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
the
officers
testified
that
they
were
investigating
his
backgrounds
and
these
other
crimes
which
he
had
told
them
about.
he
had
told
them
of
several
crimes
which
he
had
committed
since
his
escape.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
well,
i
--
what
i
understood
from
their
testimony
was
the
fact
that
if
in
investigating
these
they
could
place
davis
away
from
charlotte.
he
would
be
exonerated
of
the
crime
in
charlotte.
if
as
he
later
testified
he
was
some
place
else
breaking
into
homes,
committing
another
crime,
and
certainly
it
was
to
his
interest
that
the
charlotte
police
investigate
these
matters
and
attempt
to
find
out
what
had
occurred
and
that
was
the
explanation.
in
fact,
they
were
still
investigating
the
cooper
murder
and
beside
that
they
had
not
been
able
to
tie
in
with
davis
in
any
respect
until
they
asked
him
about
it
and
on
october
the
3rd,
again
on
the
5th,
and
then
on
the
6th
when
a
confession
occurred.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
he
claimed
that
he
was
in
belmont
at
his
auntie's
home.
but
the
auntie
didn't
appear
at
the
trial
and
testified
that
he
was
up
there.
i'd
like
to
say
one
word
about
nathaniel
cross.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
mr.
dr.
nathaniel
cross,
a
colored
pastor
who
testified
at
a
district
court.
they
called
him
uncle
tom.
i
have
never
seen
a
more
dignified
gentleman
in
my
life
than
dr.
cross.
he's
a
--
has
a
doctor's
degree
in
religion.
he's
editor
of
the
newspaper,
radio
commentator,
highly
educated,
very
rounded
person
and
has
fought,
for
many
years,
for
the
rights
of
the
underprivileged
people
particularly
their
constitutional
rights
as
the
record
would
show
in
charlotte
and
surrounding
areas.
he
testified
to
this
fact.
now,
why
did
he
come
to
see
davis?
because
davis
was
standing
and
davis
himself
was
former
member
of
his
church
in
belmont,
he
knew
him
and
when
he
finally
made
the
connection
by
reading
the
newspapers
that
this
was
the
davis
that
had
been
in
his
church
or
his
family,
he
went
down
to
visit
him
and
went
in
and
had
an
hours
of
conference
with
him
at
which
time
davis
admitted
to
him
that
he'd
been
well
treated,
no
mistreatment
by
the
police
officers
that
he
signed
a
confession
voluntarily.
it's
all
in
the
record.
now,
we
don't
like
to
talk
about
people
whose
character
is
known
but
davis
here,
i
have
a
summary
that
i
think
this
points
it
out,
29
years
old,
low
average
intelligence
according
to
the
district
court,
frankly
he
made
an
outstanding
appearance
in
the
district
court
on
the
witness
stand.
he
was
very
calm
and
he's
not
half
as
nervous
as
i
am
here
today,
but
--
and
gave
very
intelligent
answers.
now
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
this
is
davis.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
in
the
federal
district
court.
it's
the
only
time
i
had
ever
seen
him
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
made
a
very
favorable
impression
on
me
as
a
witness.
this
is
the
first
time
i
was
connected
with
the
case.
i
went
back
then
and
got
the
record
in
the
superior
court
which
this
court
had
the
written
--
that
same
record
that
appeared
certiorari,
not
once
in
41
pages
of
testimony
in
the
superior
court
did
davis
say
anything
about
any
mistreatment,
not
once.
but
when
you
get
into
the
district
court
four
years
later,
that's
his
theme
song,
police
beating
and
brutality
relay
after
relay
of
questioning
late
in
to
night,
all
night
long.
he
is
a
phenomenon.
he
has
total
recall
of
details
four
years
later.
he
has
every
component
that
this
court
has
said
was
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
four
years
later,
but
they
don't
have
at
the
original
trial,
they
don't
mention
them.
he's
a
liar
by
his
own
omission
in
the
district
court
by
identifying
an
officer
whom
he
claimed,
said
he
was
going
framed
--
framed,
something
to
that
effect.
in
the
district
court
he
identified
three
different
persons
and
then
finally
ended
up
by
saying
that
he
had
lied
about
detective
sykes
in
the
superior
court
and
you
will
find
inconsistency
after
inconsistency
between
the
two
records,
his
testimony
which
to
me
is
nothing
more
than
his
testimony
in
the
district
court
as
complete
publication,
a
good
story
dreamed
up,
fixed
up,
to
get
a
reversal,
to
save
himself
from
this
penalty
which
has
been
imposed
upon
him.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes,
i
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
we
do
not
deny
the
fact
that
it
was
there
but
we
--
we
do
say
that
all
of
the
evidence
--
a
great
deal
of
evidence
indicates
that
that
was
completely
disregarded
so
far
as
this
prisoner
was
concerned.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes,
yes
it
would.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
yes,
they
do.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
i
don't
believe
there's
any
omission
that
they
ever
interrogated
him
at
night.
at
that
time
the
detectives
only
worked
until
11
o'clock
at
night.
mr.
james
f.
bullock
i
--
i
check
back
on
it.
i
thought
i
had
--
i
believe
i
mentioned
that
in
my
brief
that
they
had
not
interrogate
him
after
11
o'clock
in
any
event
but
i
went
back
to
the
record
later
and
i
never
could
find
any
testimony
that
he
was
interrogated
at
night
by
the
police
officers.
the
latest
that
i
could
find
was
late
in
the
afternoon
four,
or
five,
six,
seven
o'clock,
something
to
that
nature.
what
time
is
it?
mr.
james
f.
bullock
i
assume
that
he
was
talking
about
the
beating
among
friend,
he
beat
you,
i
think
that's
what
he's
having
reference
to.
i
couldn't
what
word
is
that
whether
he
was
framed
or
fram
or
what
but
--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
but
after
we
use
the
time
until
i
think
the
connotation
is
it
--
the
[inaudible]
in
that
respect--
mr.
james
f.
bullock
i
don't
believe
that
we
have
any
other
points
to
make
at
this
time
unless
the
court
has
some
questions.
