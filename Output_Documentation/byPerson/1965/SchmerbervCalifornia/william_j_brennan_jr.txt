justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
the
--
on
the
facts,
this
sample
was
taken
by
a
physician?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there's
no
contention
that
the
--
in
any
way
he
departed
from
proper
medical
standards
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
--
excuse
me,
would
you
make
this
argument
like
fingerprints?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering
--
i'm
assuming
a
situation
in
which
the
fingerprints
not
voluntarily
given,
but
taken
in
which
manner
is
this
--
this
thing
is
to
indicate
the
blood
samples
were
taken
here,
wouldn't
that
argument
extend
to
the
fingerprints
too?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
when
was
the
warning
took
place?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
was
the
precise
warning?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
anything
that
you've
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
you
don't
--
that
does
not
in
privilege
terms
encompass
taking
of
the
blood,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davenport,
you
answered
me
earlier
that
the
warning
was
“anything
you
said.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
you
drew
a
distinction
between
say
and
anyone
might
say,
and
something
like
the
blood
test.
i
take
it
you
make
the
same
distinction
between
what
one
said
whether
in
writing
or
orally,
had
a
fingerprint
for
a
lineup
and
such?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
just
--
i
just
noticed
when
you
answered
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
justice
black
earlier,
that
there's
a
compulsion
again
in
giving
evidence,
of
course
the
privilege
was
phrased
“to
be
a
witness
against
himself.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
your
argument
is
that
the
privilege
then
is
limited
to
testimonial
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
evidence,
that
is
either
oral
or
written?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
boyd
being
that
--
it's
statutory
presumption
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
not
doing
something
was
to
be
deemed
a
confession.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
chief
justice
traynor
doesn't
think
this
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
finally
round
up,
as
i
recall,
that
case
by
saying,
“anyway
this
isn't
evidence,
this
is
contraband,”
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
