mr.
edward
l.
davenport
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
counsel's
argument
says
he
does
not
contest
the
reasonable
--
the
fact
that
the
grounds
for
a
search
was
a
reasonable
probable
cause
for
the
search.
it's
our
contention
that
the
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
to
police
officers
may
make
a
reasonable
search.
the
court
in
this
case
ruled
that
the
taking
of
blood
was
such
a
reasonable
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
now,
a
little
bit
more
on
the
facts,
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
were
that
this
man
had
involved
in
extremely
serious
accident,
had
driven
across
the
wrong
side
of
the
road
gone
--
probably
had
to
go
with
the
double
line
to
get
that
wrong
side
of
the
road
because
the
double
line
continues
down
through
the
road.
he
went
up
over
the
curve
across
a
parkway,
severed
a
12-inch
tree
trunk,
12
inches
in
diameter
--
excuse
me
your
honor.
and
that
he
then
continued
on
through
a
chain-link
fence
and
ended
up
parked
on
the
front
of
someone's
lawn
facing
the
opposite
direction.
from
these
facts,
the
officer
could
tell
that
the
man
had
been
going
north
bound
and
had
driven
across
the
wrong
side
of
the
road.
with
such
force,
according
to
the
evidence
and
according
to
the
photos
submitted
by
the
defense,
the
car
was
completely
destroyed.
the
time
the
officers
arrived,
the
other
passenger
was
injured
and
the
defendant
indicated
that
he
was
at
the
scene
and
had
some
injuries.
the
officer
at
that
time
smelled
alcohol
in
this
person,
saw
his
eyes
were
glassy,
watery,
bloodshot,
he
was
staggering
around
the
scene.
the
officer
had
a
conversation
at
the
scene
indicating
that
this
defendant
was
driving
the
car.
he
continued
onto
the
receiving
hospital
at
which
time
he
had
a
conversation
with
the
passenger,
which
indicated
that
the
defendant
was
driving
the
car.
from
his
observations
at
the
receiving
hospital,
he
determined
that
the
man,
in
his
opinion,
was
under
the
influence.
from
those
facts,
there
was
a
conversation
and
he
asked
the
man
to
take
the
breathalyzer
test,
he
refused.
he
then
asked
him
to
submit
to
a
blood
test
which
the
officer
said
he
agreed
to
take
at
that
time.
now,
the
counsel
refers
to
an
affidavit.
now
the
people
did
not
--
prior
to
the
submission
of
the
affidavit,
prior
to
the
starting
of
the
trial,
we
did
not
refute
the
affidavit
for
purposes
argument
on
that
motion.
the
court
continued
its
ruling
into
the
trial.
at
the
time
of
trial
of
course,
we
prove
that
that
was
in
fact
not
the
case,
the
defendant,
in
no
time,
in
his
testimony,
ever
mentioned
anything
about
the
blood
test
other
than
to
say
he
didn't
take
it
and
he
had
no
other
conversations
to
that
effect.
counsel
also
refers
to
a
broken
ankle.
the
p
--
or
defense
g,
the
hospital
record
indicates
the
man
did
not
have
a
broken
ankle
but
a
sprained
ankle
with
a
contusion.
at
least,
at
the
time
at
the
hospital,
the
officer
asked
him
and
he
said
he
agreed.
the
officer
then
obtained
a
doctor,
an
m.d.
licensed
in
the
state
of
california
practice
who
prepared
to
take
the
test.
at
that
time,
he
withdrew
his
arm
and
said
that
my
attorney
has
told
me
not
to
take
these.
the
officer
explained
to
him,
we
will
note
for
the
record
that
you
have
objected
and
therefore,
we'll
use
--
and
that
point,
the
defendants
--
under
those
circumstances,
i
will
submit,
no
one
held
the
arm
when
the
arm
test
was
taken.
now
we
submit
that
taking
of
blood
sample
on
a
medically
approved
manner
does
not
offend
the
such
“sense
of
justice”
as
referred
to
in
the
brown
versus
mississippi
or
does
constitute
brutal
or
“shock
the
conscience,”
deprived
the
person
--
the
petitioner
of
due
process
under
the
rochin
case.
now,
in
this
case,
as
distinguished
from
rochin
there
was
no
force
at
all
used
on
the
individual.
there's
no
question
he
objected.
the
--
our
contention
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
we
intend
to
limit
it,
just
to
the
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
there
is
a
quote
to
that
effect
in
the
opinion.
but
i
think
that
that's
just
goes
back
to
the
fact
that
we
derived
our
system
of
justice
from
england
rather
than
the
--
i
don't
think
that
fact
is
material
to
the
determination
of
the
case,
one
way
or
the
other.
the
point
and
i
think
that
our
--
as
we
see
the
case,
we
submit
that
breithaupt
versus
abram
should
still
be
the
law
of
this
court
in
view
of
the
later
decision
of
mapp
versus
ohio,
malloy
versus
hogan,
and
escobedo
versus
illinois.
we
feel
that
the
importance
--
the
question
to
be
determined,
we
have
the
officers
have
a
right
to
make
a
reasonable
search
of
the
person
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
we
feel
that
the
questions
is
--
one
of
the
reasons
of
this
search
and
we
submit
that
the
taking
of
blood
test
is
not,
in
the
least,
unreasonable.
at
the
time
--
shortly
after
breithaupt,
california
came
down
with
the
case
of
people
versus
duroncelay.
at
that
time,
california
had
already
accepted
the
exclusionary
rule
prior
to
mapp
and
the
people
versus
cahan.
and
the
court
at
that
time
considered
whether
or
not
this
was
a
reasonable
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest,
and
they
determined
it
was.
and
they
went
back
and
said,
in
one
of
these
circumstances,
it
should
be
considered
as
to
reasonableness,
is
of
course
the
great
incident
of
death
or
injury
on
our
highways
that
they
consider
it
caused
by
the
use
of
alcohol
and
driving.
but
it
should
be
considered
too
that
this
test
was
--
extracting
of
blood
was
so
common
with
no
resulting
injury
to
the
individual.
there
was
so
reliable
to
this
effect,
both
to
convict
them
and
to
exonerate,
to
show
the
true
state
of
the
individual
at
the
time,
which
was
in
question,
that
this
was
in
fact
a
reasonable
search
and
seizure.
and
i
submit
the
blood
test
is
a
very
minor
deal
with
my
own
three-year-old
daughter
who
submitted
too
last
week
without
a
whimper,
so
i
see
no
shocking
or
the
community
standards
about
that
sort
of
thing
attest.
that
the
importance
of
the
blood
test,
its
probity
value
has
to
be
taken
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
accident.
but
therefore,
that
any
time,
it
has
allowed
it
to
diminish,
the
person,
as
you
know
sobers
up
against
the
burn
of
the
alcohol,
it
does
not
have
the
probity
value.
but
it
is
a
reliable
method,
the
testing,
and
the
blood
analysis,
and
chemical
analysis
--
it
has
been
upheld
by
the
courts.
but
i
would
say
in
california
under
--
in
a
case
law,
to
deny
an
individual
arrested
for
a
charge
involving
intoxication,
to
make
a
phone
call
for
his
own
doctor
to
take
a
test,
is
a
denial
of
due
process.
for
the
police
at
any
time
to
interfere
with
the
man
after
he's
released
is
denial
of
due
process
and
no
government
agency
can
do
anything
to
interfere
with
this
taking
of
blood
test
even
though
he
may
be
inquiring
at
a
city-owned
hospital,
they
have
a
duty
to
give
him
that
blood
test.
so
i
therefore
say
that
this
is
merely
the
taking
of
real
evidence
which
will
prove
the
issue
of
fact.
the
question
of
reasonableness
warrants
for
each
case,
we
cannot
take
and
conjure
up
hypotheticals,
which
a
situation
be
unreasonable,
we
are
limited
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest,
the
taking
of
blood
was
in
all
certainly
reasonable,
it
had
no
brutal
force,
it
didn't
upset
the
community
standards,
this
is
something
that
is
readily
accepted
by
them.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
as
a
question
of
law
or
as
question
into
our
--
what
we
have
done
in
the
circumstances?
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
as
to
my
opinion
of
the
law
mr.
chief
justice
or
as
to
what
would
have
happen
under
the
circumstances?
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
question
is
one
of
the
right
to
make
a
reasonable
search
so
the
question
on
each
case
must
be
determined
as
what
was
done
reasonable.
in
the
duroncelay
case,
the
man
resisted
to
some
extent
of
trying
to
move
his
arm
away.
they
held
his
arm
and
the
blood
was
taken.
the
court
said
that
that
was
not
a
violation
of
the
rochin
rule,
the
brutal
force.
the
question
becomes
one
of
--
when
you
use
excessive
force
and
that
point
re-arises,
then
that
is
no
longer
reasonable
search
and
no
longer
a
reasonable
seizure.
i
submit,
as
counsel
said,
that
we
are
not
about
to
take
a
test.
in
fact
in
our
policy
in
los
angeles,
we
do
not
take
blood
test
under
any
--
if
there
was
any
resistance.
we
are
not
going
to
approach
the
rochin
rule.
but
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
think
that
is
--
the
question
determined
in
each
case
is
whether
or
not
the
taking
was
reasonable.
the
man
as
i
say
in
duroncelay
merely
tries
to
pull
his
arm
away.
the
holding
of
that
arm
is
certainly
not
to
make
the
blood
take
--
the
taking
of
the
sample
unreasonable,
but
if
we
get
to
the
situation
where
--
of
rochin,
it
certainly
does.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
yes,
i
believe
they
have
your
honor.
that's
our
position.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
right.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well
your
honor,
i
submit
that
the
rochin
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
oh
yes
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
if
your
honor
please,
in
answering
both
mr.
justice
harlan's
questions
and
your
question,
i
think
that
the
question
again
is
one
of
reasonableness
in
each
individual
case.
that
if
the
taking
is
reasonable
under
the
particular
circumstance
of
that
case,
there
is
no
problem.
if
we
go
so
far
as
to
get
this
brutal,
aggressive,
excessive
force,
then
the
search
at
that
time
becomes
unreasonable.
we
certainly
have
a
right
to
take
an
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
i
believe
and
that
is
the
duroncelay
rule
and
i
think
that
the
question,
if
we
do,
could
become
excessive,
then
you
may
no
longer
reasonable.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
i
would
say
yes
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
yes,
if
they're
able
to
do
it
without
using
excessive
brutal
force.
if
they're
able
to
take
and
hold
his
arm
and
nothing
more
happens,
i
don't
see
--
there
are
no
--
they
have
a
right
to
take
the
blood,
they
have
the
right
to
use
reasonable
force
to
do
it.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
then
you're
beginning
to
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
then
you
are
getting
to
a
problem
and
that's
the
time
when
we
would
not
take
a
blood
test.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
you
may
still
have
a
--
we
may
still
have
a
right
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
no,
your
honor,
i
say
the
right
is
the
same
in
both
cases.
if
we
--
it's
reasonable
--
if
we
determine
that's
a
reasonable
search,
we
could
do
it
in
both
cases,
because
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
we
reach
the
situation
where
the
force
is
so
great
that
we
get
into
our
fact
situation
tantamount
to
that
in
rochin,
then
that
search
could
become
unreasonable
under
the
circumstances.
i
think
that
--
that
when
--
there
are
numerous
cases
where
law-abiding
citizens
do
not
get
the
same
rights
as
one
who
has
a
complete
--
“brute”
as
you
put
it.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
we
have
numerous
situations
in
the
law
now
where
one
who
obeys
the
law
doesn't
have
the
problems.
we
have
the
situation
in
our
courts
that
one
who
obeys
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
probably,
suppose
he's
charged
with
a
crime,
it
becomes
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
--
charge
with
a
crime,
if
he
comes
to
the
court
timely,
he
will
--
he
waives
his
rights,
he
does
not
get
the
benefit.
and
some
of
the
others
who
do
not
do
this
were
able
to
prefect
the
rights
because
they
completely
disobey
the
law.
i
think
there
are
lots
of
times
in
society
without
going
into
law
that
where
someone
is
a
law
abiding
citizen,
doesn't
get
all
the
same
rights
and
benefits
that
someone
who
just
disregard
the
law
do.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
the
law
and
the
right
remains
the
same
in
both
cases.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
they
are
entitled
to
take
the
blood
in
both
cases
your
honor.
but
it
had,
it
would
still
have
to
be
done
in
a
reasonable
manner.
i
say
that
we
have
the
right
to
take
it
and
possibly
go
back
to
rochin,
if
they
could
done
that
in
a
reasonable
manner,
we
cover
that,
there
would
never
been
any
holding
as
it
was.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
i
would
say
that
your
honor
whether
he
resist
physically
or
he
submits,
those
objections
should
make
no
difference
at
all.
the
case
we
have
before
us,
the
man
was
sitting
in
a
treatment
room
in
a
receiving
hospital
where
he
had
--
where
he
had
been
given
a
tetanus
shot,
where
his
lips
had
been
sewn
up,
all
much
more,
he
had
much
more
punctures
there
than
you
would
have
when
taking
a
blood
test
and
there
no
objections
with
those.
i
think
that
under
the
circumstances,
your
basic
rules
and
rights
are
different
than
--
neither
in
--
than
not
at
all.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
he
was
--
yes,
your
honor
he
was
arrested
in
the
--
he's
in
the
hospital.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
he
was
arrested
at
1:45
when
the
blood
test
was
taken.
and
he
was
given
his
rights
to
counsel,
has
a
right
to
remain
silent,
he
were
told
that
anything
he
said
would
be
used
against
him.the
blood
was
taken
at
2
a.m.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
he
said
that
he
had
--
first
he
agreed
he
would
take
it.
then
when
the
doctor
came
in
and
presented
to
him
--
according
to
police
officers
testimony,
presented
himself
ready
to
take
it.
but
he
said,
he
had
been
told
by
his
attorney
not
to
take
such
test.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
the
warning
was
in
between
that
time,
between
the
time
he
was
arrested
and
the
time
when
the
blood
was
taken.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
the
warning
was
precisely
that
--
you
have
a
right
to
obtain
--
to
have
counsel,
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent,
anything
that
you
say
will
be
used
against
you.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
we
feel
it
does
not
your
honor,
no.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
oh,
in
an
ordinary
language,
in
layman's
language
your
honor,
he
submitted
to
the
blood
test
but
he
noted
he
did
not
voluntarily
submit.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
i
couldn't
say
why
he
submitted.
the
only
thing
he
was
interested
in
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
the
blood
test
was
taken
without
his
consent.
there's
no
question
to
that.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
the
blood
test
was
taken
without
his
consent.
the
point
of
saying
that
he
submitted
was
to
indicate
there
was
no
force
used
or
no
resistance.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
i
would
--
yes,
your
honor,
the
taking
of
blood
test
was
to
be
able
to
use
it
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
or
we
can
use
it
as
evidence
to
exonerate
him
and
to
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
the
blood
was
taken
without
his
consent.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
that
is
correct
basically,
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
the
nalline
test
in
california
your
honor
is
covered
by
a
statute.
it
can
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
--
only
be
given
with
consent
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
i
(voice
overlap)
--
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
alright,
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
not
from
a
separate
crime,
your
honor.
you
go
back
to
arrest.
arrest
was
based
on
reasonable
and
probable
cause
to
things
that
he
had
committed,
the
crime
of
driving
while
under
the
influence
of
intoxicating
liquor
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
--
under
the
felony
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
we
would
not
have
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
it
is
your
honor,
but
we
would
not
have
reasonable
and
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest,
we
could
therefore
not
base
a
search
requiring
a
reasonable
and
probable
cause
on
an
illegal
arrest.
otherwise,
our
basis
for
the
arrest
is
the
intoxication
elements
we
have
before
the
arrest
therefore,
we
can
search
only
in
relation
to
the
alcohol
--
driving
while
under
the
intoxication
of
liquor.
in
other
words
we
--
we
contend
the
whole
thing
as
to
this
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
therefore,
that's
why
we
have
probable
cause.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
that's
--
that
is
possible,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
your
honor,
in
boyd
versus
united
states?
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
boyd
is
a
little
different
in
our
case,
i
submit.
boyd
is
a
double
rule
case.
boyd
they
said
either
one,
you
haven't
--
the
court
said
that
they're
requiring
the
man
to
bring
his
books
to
court
was
in
fact
tantamount
to
a
search.
they
he
held
it
was
unreasonable.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
the
majority
opinion
your
honor
said
it
was
tantamount
to
a
search
and
if
he
brought
it
to
court,
it
was
the
same
as
an
unlawful
search.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
probable
cause.
then
you
get
into
the
situation,
they
said
if
you
don't
bring
it
to
court,
therefore
you
confess.
if
you
confess,
therefore,
it's
a
confession
by
law
and
that's
against
the
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
but
compelled
him
to
confess,
if
he
didn't
--
if
he
didn't
bring
the
material
for
the
fourth
amendment,
he
confessed
by
law
under
the
fifth
amendment.
he
was
deemed
to
confession.
he
confessed
every
element
in
the
people's
case,
charging
the
complaint.
so
it's
the
same
as
an
oral
compunction.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
yes,
your
honor.
they
did
to
this
extent.
the
two
were
controlled.
again,
they
said
one,
if
you
bring
it
--
it's
an
unlawful
search
without
probable
cause,
situation
we
don't
have.
if
you
don't,
you
confess
and
therefore
you're
deemed
by
law
to
give
a
confession
to
all
the
charges
of
the
government,
because
things
can
be
distinguished,
at
least
the
way
i
read
in
case
your
honor,
those
are
the
two
distinguishing
points.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
yes,
your
honor.
we
don't
feel
that
every
aid
that
a
defendant
or
suspect
is
required
to
give
the
prosecution
amounts
to
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
i
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
that
is
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
that
is
correct
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
that
is
correct
--
or
something
that
is
tantamount
to
that,
such
as
the
boyd
case.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
--
he
could
not
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
your
honor
i
don't
wish
to
disagree
with
you.
but
as
i
read
that
case,
the
court
in
the
majority
opinion
said
that
that
was
tantamount
to
a
search
requiring
to
bring
it
--
it
was
unreasonable
because
there's
no
probable
cause.
and
that's
the
way
i
understand
that
case.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
taking
the
blood,
yes
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
a
reasonable
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
that's
our
position.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
we
are
searching
for
the
physical
evidence
which
was
in
evidence
at
that
time,
the
condition
of
the
man
whether
or
not
he
was
intoxicated.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
search
warrant
would
not
be
practical,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
search
warrants
would
lie
for
obtaining
evidence
on
reasonable
and
probable
cause.
under
the
circumstances,
i
suppose
that
we
could
state
our
probable
cause
for
his
--
taking
the
blood
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
your
honor,
in
the
case
of
people
versus
thayer
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
last
week
to
--
there
is
a
--
it
seems
to
distinguish
that,
that
there's
no
basic
distinction
to
be
a
probable
cause
under
a
search
warrant
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
i
would
--
your
honor,
chief
justice
traynor
agreed
in
duroncelay
case,
which
we
rely
on
heavily,
as
well
as
the
other
cases
and
i
would
--
must
rely
heavily
on
the
cases
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
yes,
your
honor
that's
--
but
that's
what
the
courts
have
been
doing
for
a
great
number
of
years
that
every
bit
of
evidence
such
as
ledger
books
has
always
found
to
be
confidential
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
what
difference
it'll
make?
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
it's
the
same
difference
in
taking
of
any
evidence,
it
helps
to
prove
the
charge.
it
also
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
yes,
your
honor.
we
use
the
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
in
los
angeles
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
in
very
cases
--
when
we
use
it
in
los
angeles
where
a
man
has
injuries,
then
we
use
that
--
in
those
situations
and
very
few,
we
have
201
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
we
have
none
your
honor,
except
the
case
we
have.
if
we
don't
--
if
a
man
refused
to
take
the
breathalyzer,
it's
very
difficult
as
the
counsel
pointed
out.
you
cannot
force
the
man
to
take
it
without
worrying
about
the
rochin
case.
in
this
case,
it's
one
where
it's
a
very
simple
matter
to
take
blood,
get
it
analyzed,
the
blood
test
is
the
most
accurate.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
no,
i
--
it
comes
back
to
the
question
of
facts
in
the
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
i'm
saying
your
honor,
if
you
could
use
such
force
without
using
the
brutality
or
shocking
the
conscience
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
--
and
then
it
would
be
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
i
don't
know.
i
really
can't
say,
your
honor.
it
have
to
wait
to
determine
that
case
when
i'd
see
it.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
i
don't
know.
i
can't
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
it's
provide
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
we
have
to
determine
that
it
must
be
reasonable
taken
your
honor.
we
have
a
right
to
take
it,
if
we
can
take
it
without
using
the
excessive
force
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
our
position
is
not
that.
our
position
is
if
we
have
the
right
to
take
it,
we
can
take
it
as
long
as
we
do
it
reasonably.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
if
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
there
was
no
reasonable
(voice
overlap)
--
your
honor,
i
think
we
have
to
read
“reasonable”
in
all
three
of
these
amendments,
there
was
no
reasonable
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
--
and
probable
cause
in
the
boyd
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
when
you
take
the
two
together,
i'd
say
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
--
as
the
boyd
case
is
distinguished
from
this
one.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
no,
your
honor.
we'd
come
back
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
is
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
when
we
say
that's
limited
by
the
cases
to
oral
compulsion.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
oral
compulsion
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
i'm
sorry
your
honor
we're
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
your
honor,
which
is
why
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
when
the
--
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
we
see
it
is
now
refers
to
testimonial
evidence,
and
not
to
non-testimonial
evidence.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
no,
i
don't.
but
i'd
say
that
has
to
be
oral
statement
from
his
lips
that
are
tantamount
to
an
admission
or
a
confession.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
your
honor
that
seems
to
be
the
law
today.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
no,
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
your
honor,
that
wouldn't
be
reasonable
again,
any
other
questions
(voice
overlap),
no
other
questions?
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
counsel's
argument
says
he
does
not
contest
the
reasonable
--
the
fact
that
the
grounds
for
a
search
was
a
reasonable
probable
cause
for
the
search.
it's
our
contention
that
the
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
to
police
officers
may
make
a
reasonable
search.
the
court
in
this
case
ruled
that
the
taking
of
blood
was
such
a
reasonable
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
now,
a
little
bit
more
on
the
facts,
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
were
that
this
man
had
involved
in
extremely
serious
accident,
had
driven
across
the
wrong
side
of
the
road
gone
--
probably
had
to
go
with
the
double
line
to
get
that
wrong
side
of
the
road
because
the
double
line
continues
down
through
the
road.
he
went
up
over
the
curve
across
a
parkway,
severed
a
12-inch
tree
trunk,
12
inches
in
diameter
--
excuse
me
your
honor.
and
that
he
then
continued
on
through
a
chain-link
fence
and
ended
up
parked
on
the
front
of
someone's
lawn
facing
the
opposite
direction.
from
these
facts,
the
officer
could
tell
that
the
man
had
been
going
north
bound
and
had
driven
across
the
wrong
side
of
the
road.
with
such
force,
according
to
the
evidence
and
according
to
the
photos
submitted
by
the
defense,
the
car
was
completely
destroyed.
the
time
the
officers
arrived,
the
other
passenger
was
injured
and
the
defendant
indicated
that
he
was
at
the
scene
and
had
some
injuries.
the
officer
at
that
time
smelled
alcohol
in
this
person,
saw
his
eyes
were
glassy,
watery,
bloodshot,
he
was
staggering
around
the
scene.
the
officer
had
a
conversation
at
the
scene
indicating
that
this
defendant
was
driving
the
car.
he
continued
onto
the
receiving
hospital
at
which
time
he
had
a
conversation
with
the
passenger,
which
indicated
that
the
defendant
was
driving
the
car.
from
his
observations
at
the
receiving
hospital,
he
determined
that
the
man,
in
his
opinion,
was
under
the
influence.
from
those
facts,
there
was
a
conversation
and
he
asked
the
man
to
take
the
breathalyzer
test,
he
refused.
he
then
asked
him
to
submit
to
a
blood
test
which
the
officer
said
he
agreed
to
take
at
that
time.
now,
the
counsel
refers
to
an
affidavit.
now
the
people
did
not
--
prior
to
the
submission
of
the
affidavit,
prior
to
the
starting
of
the
trial,
we
did
not
refute
the
affidavit
for
purposes
argument
on
that
motion.
the
court
continued
its
ruling
into
the
trial.
at
the
time
of
trial
of
course,
we
prove
that
that
was
in
fact
not
the
case,
the
defendant,
in
no
time,
in
his
testimony,
ever
mentioned
anything
about
the
blood
test
other
than
to
say
he
didn't
take
it
and
he
had
no
other
conversations
to
that
effect.
counsel
also
refers
to
a
broken
ankle.
the
p
--
or
defense
g,
the
hospital
record
indicates
the
man
did
not
have
a
broken
ankle
but
a
sprained
ankle
with
a
contusion.
at
least,
at
the
time
at
the
hospital,
the
officer
asked
him
and
he
said
he
agreed.
the
officer
then
obtained
a
doctor,
an
m.d.
licensed
in
the
state
of
california
practice
who
prepared
to
take
the
test.
at
that
time,
he
withdrew
his
arm
and
said
that
my
attorney
has
told
me
not
to
take
these.
the
officer
explained
to
him,
we
will
note
for
the
record
that
you
have
objected
and
therefore,
we'll
use
--
and
that
point,
the
defendants
--
under
those
circumstances,
i
will
submit,
no
one
held
the
arm
when
the
arm
test
was
taken.
now
we
submit
that
taking
of
blood
sample
on
a
medically
approved
manner
does
not
offend
the
such
“sense
of
justice”
as
referred
to
in
the
brown
versus
mississippi
or
does
constitute
brutal
or
“shock
the
conscience,”
deprived
the
person
--
the
petitioner
of
due
process
under
the
rochin
case.
now,
in
this
case,
as
distinguished
from
rochin
there
was
no
force
at
all
used
on
the
individual.
there's
no
question
he
objected.
the
--
our
contention
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
we
intend
to
limit
it,
just
to
the
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
there
is
a
quote
to
that
effect
in
the
opinion.
but
i
think
that
that's
just
goes
back
to
the
fact
that
we
derived
our
system
of
justice
from
england
rather
than
the
--
i
don't
think
that
fact
is
material
to
the
determination
of
the
case,
one
way
or
the
other.
the
point
and
i
think
that
our
--
as
we
see
the
case,
we
submit
that
breithaupt
versus
abram
should
still
be
the
law
of
this
court
in
view
of
the
later
decision
of
mapp
versus
ohio,
malloy
versus
hogan,
and
escobedo
versus
illinois.
we
feel
that
the
importance
--
the
question
to
be
determined,
we
have
the
officers
have
a
right
to
make
a
reasonable
search
of
the
person
at
the
time
of
the
arrest.
we
feel
that
the
questions
is
--
one
of
the
reasons
of
this
search
and
we
submit
that
the
taking
of
blood
test
is
not,
in
the
least,
unreasonable.
at
the
time
--
shortly
after
breithaupt,
california
came
down
with
the
case
of
people
versus
duroncelay.
at
that
time,
california
had
already
accepted
the
exclusionary
rule
prior
to
mapp
and
the
people
versus
cahan.
and
the
court
at
that
time
considered
whether
or
not
this
was
a
reasonable
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest,
and
they
determined
it
was.
and
they
went
back
and
said,
in
one
of
these
circumstances,
it
should
be
considered
as
to
reasonableness,
is
of
course
the
great
incident
of
death
or
injury
on
our
highways
that
they
consider
it
caused
by
the
use
of
alcohol
and
driving.
but
it
should
be
considered
too
that
this
test
was
--
extracting
of
blood
was
so
common
with
no
resulting
injury
to
the
individual.
there
was
so
reliable
to
this
effect,
both
to
convict
them
and
to
exonerate,
to
show
the
true
state
of
the
individual
at
the
time,
which
was
in
question,
that
this
was
in
fact
a
reasonable
search
and
seizure.
and
i
submit
the
blood
test
is
a
very
minor
deal
with
my
own
three-year-old
daughter
who
submitted
too
last
week
without
a
whimper,
so
i
see
no
shocking
or
the
community
standards
about
that
sort
of
thing
attest.
that
the
importance
of
the
blood
test,
its
probity
value
has
to
be
taken
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
accident.
but
therefore,
that
any
time,
it
has
allowed
it
to
diminish,
the
person,
as
you
know
sobers
up
against
the
burn
of
the
alcohol,
it
does
not
have
the
probity
value.
but
it
is
a
reliable
method,
the
testing,
and
the
blood
analysis,
and
chemical
analysis
--
it
has
been
upheld
by
the
courts.
but
i
would
say
in
california
under
--
in
a
case
law,
to
deny
an
individual
arrested
for
a
charge
involving
intoxication,
to
make
a
phone
call
for
his
own
doctor
to
take
a
test,
is
a
denial
of
due
process.
for
the
police
at
any
time
to
interfere
with
the
man
after
he's
released
is
denial
of
due
process
and
no
government
agency
can
do
anything
to
interfere
with
this
taking
of
blood
test
even
though
he
may
be
inquiring
at
a
city-owned
hospital,
they
have
a
duty
to
give
him
that
blood
test.
so
i
therefore
say
that
this
is
merely
the
taking
of
real
evidence
which
will
prove
the
issue
of
fact.
the
question
of
reasonableness
warrants
for
each
case,
we
cannot
take
and
conjure
up
hypotheticals,
which
a
situation
be
unreasonable,
we
are
limited
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest,
the
taking
of
blood
was
in
all
certainly
reasonable,
it
had
no
brutal
force,
it
didn't
upset
the
community
standards,
this
is
something
that
is
readily
accepted
by
them.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
as
a
question
of
law
or
as
question
into
our
--
what
we
have
done
in
the
circumstances?
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
as
to
my
opinion
of
the
law
mr.
chief
justice
or
as
to
what
would
have
happen
under
the
circumstances?
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
question
is
one
of
the
right
to
make
a
reasonable
search
so
the
question
on
each
case
must
be
determined
as
what
was
done
reasonable.
in
the
duroncelay
case,
the
man
resisted
to
some
extent
of
trying
to
move
his
arm
away.
they
held
his
arm
and
the
blood
was
taken.
the
court
said
that
that
was
not
a
violation
of
the
rochin
rule,
the
brutal
force.
the
question
becomes
one
of
--
when
you
use
excessive
force
and
that
point
re-arises,
then
that
is
no
longer
reasonable
search
and
no
longer
a
reasonable
seizure.
i
submit,
as
counsel
said,
that
we
are
not
about
to
take
a
test.
in
fact
in
our
policy
in
los
angeles,
we
do
not
take
blood
test
under
any
--
if
there
was
any
resistance.
we
are
not
going
to
approach
the
rochin
rule.
but
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
think
that
is
--
the
question
determined
in
each
case
is
whether
or
not
the
taking
was
reasonable.
the
man
as
i
say
in
duroncelay
merely
tries
to
pull
his
arm
away.
the
holding
of
that
arm
is
certainly
not
to
make
the
blood
take
--
the
taking
of
the
sample
unreasonable,
but
if
we
get
to
the
situation
where
--
of
rochin,
it
certainly
does.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
yes,
i
believe
they
have
your
honor.
that's
our
position.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
right.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well
your
honor,
i
submit
that
the
rochin
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
oh
yes
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
if
your
honor
please,
in
answering
both
mr.
justice
harlan's
questions
and
your
question,
i
think
that
the
question
again
is
one
of
reasonableness
in
each
individual
case.
that
if
the
taking
is
reasonable
under
the
particular
circumstance
of
that
case,
there
is
no
problem.
if
we
go
so
far
as
to
get
this
brutal,
aggressive,
excessive
force,
then
the
search
at
that
time
becomes
unreasonable.
we
certainly
have
a
right
to
take
an
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
i
believe
and
that
is
the
duroncelay
rule
and
i
think
that
the
question,
if
we
do,
could
become
excessive,
then
you
may
no
longer
reasonable.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
i
would
say
yes
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
yes,
if
they're
able
to
do
it
without
using
excessive
brutal
force.
if
they're
able
to
take
and
hold
his
arm
and
nothing
more
happens,
i
don't
see
--
there
are
no
--
they
have
a
right
to
take
the
blood,
they
have
the
right
to
use
reasonable
force
to
do
it.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
then
you're
beginning
to
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
then
you
are
getting
to
a
problem
and
that's
the
time
when
we
would
not
take
a
blood
test.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
you
may
still
have
a
--
we
may
still
have
a
right
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
no,
your
honor,
i
say
the
right
is
the
same
in
both
cases.
if
we
--
it's
reasonable
--
if
we
determine
that's
a
reasonable
search,
we
could
do
it
in
both
cases,
because
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
we
reach
the
situation
where
the
force
is
so
great
that
we
get
into
our
fact
situation
tantamount
to
that
in
rochin,
then
that
search
could
become
unreasonable
under
the
circumstances.
i
think
that
--
that
when
--
there
are
numerous
cases
where
law-abiding
citizens
do
not
get
the
same
rights
as
one
who
has
a
complete
--
“brute”
as
you
put
it.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
we
have
numerous
situations
in
the
law
now
where
one
who
obeys
the
law
doesn't
have
the
problems.
we
have
the
situation
in
our
courts
that
one
who
obeys
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
probably,
suppose
he's
charged
with
a
crime,
it
becomes
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
--
charge
with
a
crime,
if
he
comes
to
the
court
timely,
he
will
--
he
waives
his
rights,
he
does
not
get
the
benefit.
and
some
of
the
others
who
do
not
do
this
were
able
to
prefect
the
rights
because
they
completely
disobey
the
law.
i
think
there
are
lots
of
times
in
society
without
going
into
law
that
where
someone
is
a
law
abiding
citizen,
doesn't
get
all
the
same
rights
and
benefits
that
someone
who
just
disregard
the
law
do.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
the
law
and
the
right
remains
the
same
in
both
cases.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
they
are
entitled
to
take
the
blood
in
both
cases
your
honor.
but
it
had,
it
would
still
have
to
be
done
in
a
reasonable
manner.
i
say
that
we
have
the
right
to
take
it
and
possibly
go
back
to
rochin,
if
they
could
done
that
in
a
reasonable
manner,
we
cover
that,
there
would
never
been
any
holding
as
it
was.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
i
would
say
that
your
honor
whether
he
resist
physically
or
he
submits,
those
objections
should
make
no
difference
at
all.
the
case
we
have
before
us,
the
man
was
sitting
in
a
treatment
room
in
a
receiving
hospital
where
he
had
--
where
he
had
been
given
a
tetanus
shot,
where
his
lips
had
been
sewn
up,
all
much
more,
he
had
much
more
punctures
there
than
you
would
have
when
taking
a
blood
test
and
there
no
objections
with
those.
i
think
that
under
the
circumstances,
your
basic
rules
and
rights
are
different
than
--
neither
in
--
than
not
at
all.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
he
was
--
yes,
your
honor
he
was
arrested
in
the
--
he's
in
the
hospital.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
he
was
arrested
at
1:45
when
the
blood
test
was
taken.
and
he
was
given
his
rights
to
counsel,
has
a
right
to
remain
silent,
he
were
told
that
anything
he
said
would
be
used
against
him.the
blood
was
taken
at
2
a.m.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
he
said
that
he
had
--
first
he
agreed
he
would
take
it.
then
when
the
doctor
came
in
and
presented
to
him
--
according
to
police
officers
testimony,
presented
himself
ready
to
take
it.
but
he
said,
he
had
been
told
by
his
attorney
not
to
take
such
test.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
the
warning
was
in
between
that
time,
between
the
time
he
was
arrested
and
the
time
when
the
blood
was
taken.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
the
warning
was
precisely
that
--
you
have
a
right
to
obtain
--
to
have
counsel,
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent,
anything
that
you
say
will
be
used
against
you.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
we
feel
it
does
not
your
honor,
no.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
oh,
in
an
ordinary
language,
in
layman's
language
your
honor,
he
submitted
to
the
blood
test
but
he
noted
he
did
not
voluntarily
submit.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
i
couldn't
say
why
he
submitted.
the
only
thing
he
was
interested
in
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
the
blood
test
was
taken
without
his
consent.
there's
no
question
to
that.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
the
blood
test
was
taken
without
his
consent.
the
point
of
saying
that
he
submitted
was
to
indicate
there
was
no
force
used
or
no
resistance.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
i
would
--
yes,
your
honor,
the
taking
of
blood
test
was
to
be
able
to
use
it
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
or
we
can
use
it
as
evidence
to
exonerate
him
and
to
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
the
blood
was
taken
without
his
consent.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
that
is
correct
basically,
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
the
nalline
test
in
california
your
honor
is
covered
by
a
statute.
it
can
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
--
only
be
given
with
consent
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
i
(voice
overlap)
--
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
alright,
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
not
from
a
separate
crime,
your
honor.
you
go
back
to
arrest.
arrest
was
based
on
reasonable
and
probable
cause
to
things
that
he
had
committed,
the
crime
of
driving
while
under
the
influence
of
intoxicating
liquor
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
--
under
the
felony
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
we
would
not
have
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
it
is
your
honor,
but
we
would
not
have
reasonable
and
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest,
we
could
therefore
not
base
a
search
requiring
a
reasonable
and
probable
cause
on
an
illegal
arrest.
otherwise,
our
basis
for
the
arrest
is
the
intoxication
elements
we
have
before
the
arrest
therefore,
we
can
search
only
in
relation
to
the
alcohol
--
driving
while
under
the
intoxication
of
liquor.
in
other
words
we
--
we
contend
the
whole
thing
as
to
this
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
therefore,
that's
why
we
have
probable
cause.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
that's
--
that
is
possible,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
your
honor,
in
boyd
versus
united
states?
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
boyd
is
a
little
different
in
our
case,
i
submit.
boyd
is
a
double
rule
case.
boyd
they
said
either
one,
you
haven't
--
the
court
said
that
they're
requiring
the
man
to
bring
his
books
to
court
was
in
fact
tantamount
to
a
search.
they
he
held
it
was
unreasonable.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
the
majority
opinion
your
honor
said
it
was
tantamount
to
a
search
and
if
he
brought
it
to
court,
it
was
the
same
as
an
unlawful
search.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
probable
cause.
then
you
get
into
the
situation,
they
said
if
you
don't
bring
it
to
court,
therefore
you
confess.
if
you
confess,
therefore,
it's
a
confession
by
law
and
that's
against
the
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
but
compelled
him
to
confess,
if
he
didn't
--
if
he
didn't
bring
the
material
for
the
fourth
amendment,
he
confessed
by
law
under
the
fifth
amendment.
he
was
deemed
to
confession.
he
confessed
every
element
in
the
people's
case,
charging
the
complaint.
so
it's
the
same
as
an
oral
compunction.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
yes,
your
honor.
they
did
to
this
extent.
the
two
were
controlled.
again,
they
said
one,
if
you
bring
it
--
it's
an
unlawful
search
without
probable
cause,
situation
we
don't
have.
if
you
don't,
you
confess
and
therefore
you're
deemed
by
law
to
give
a
confession
to
all
the
charges
of
the
government,
because
things
can
be
distinguished,
at
least
the
way
i
read
in
case
your
honor,
those
are
the
two
distinguishing
points.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
yes,
your
honor.
we
don't
feel
that
every
aid
that
a
defendant
or
suspect
is
required
to
give
the
prosecution
amounts
to
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
i
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
that
is
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
that
is
correct
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
that
is
correct
--
or
something
that
is
tantamount
to
that,
such
as
the
boyd
case.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
--
he
could
not
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
your
honor
i
don't
wish
to
disagree
with
you.
but
as
i
read
that
case,
the
court
in
the
majority
opinion
said
that
that
was
tantamount
to
a
search
requiring
to
bring
it
--
it
was
unreasonable
because
there's
no
probable
cause.
and
that's
the
way
i
understand
that
case.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
taking
the
blood,
yes
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
a
reasonable
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
that's
our
position.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
we
are
searching
for
the
physical
evidence
which
was
in
evidence
at
that
time,
the
condition
of
the
man
whether
or
not
he
was
intoxicated.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
search
warrant
would
not
be
practical,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
search
warrants
would
lie
for
obtaining
evidence
on
reasonable
and
probable
cause.
under
the
circumstances,
i
suppose
that
we
could
state
our
probable
cause
for
his
--
taking
the
blood
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
your
honor,
in
the
case
of
people
versus
thayer
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
last
week
to
--
there
is
a
--
it
seems
to
distinguish
that,
that
there's
no
basic
distinction
to
be
a
probable
cause
under
a
search
warrant
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
i
would
--
your
honor,
chief
justice
traynor
agreed
in
duroncelay
case,
which
we
rely
on
heavily,
as
well
as
the
other
cases
and
i
would
--
must
rely
heavily
on
the
cases
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
yes,
your
honor
that's
--
but
that's
what
the
courts
have
been
doing
for
a
great
number
of
years
that
every
bit
of
evidence
such
as
ledger
books
has
always
found
to
be
confidential
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
what
difference
it'll
make?
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
it's
the
same
difference
in
taking
of
any
evidence,
it
helps
to
prove
the
charge.
it
also
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
yes,
your
honor.
we
use
the
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
in
los
angeles
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
in
very
cases
--
when
we
use
it
in
los
angeles
where
a
man
has
injuries,
then
we
use
that
--
in
those
situations
and
very
few,
we
have
201
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
we
have
none
your
honor,
except
the
case
we
have.
if
we
don't
--
if
a
man
refused
to
take
the
breathalyzer,
it's
very
difficult
as
the
counsel
pointed
out.
you
cannot
force
the
man
to
take
it
without
worrying
about
the
rochin
case.
in
this
case,
it's
one
where
it's
a
very
simple
matter
to
take
blood,
get
it
analyzed,
the
blood
test
is
the
most
accurate.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
no,
i
--
it
comes
back
to
the
question
of
facts
in
the
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
i'm
saying
your
honor,
if
you
could
use
such
force
without
using
the
brutality
or
shocking
the
conscience
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
--
and
then
it
would
be
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
i
don't
know.
i
really
can't
say,
your
honor.
it
have
to
wait
to
determine
that
case
when
i'd
see
it.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
i
don't
know.
i
can't
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
it's
provide
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
we
have
to
determine
that
it
must
be
reasonable
taken
your
honor.
we
have
a
right
to
take
it,
if
we
can
take
it
without
using
the
excessive
force
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
our
position
is
not
that.
our
position
is
if
we
have
the
right
to
take
it,
we
can
take
it
as
long
as
we
do
it
reasonably.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
if
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
there
was
no
reasonable
(voice
overlap)
--
your
honor,
i
think
we
have
to
read
“reasonable”
in
all
three
of
these
amendments,
there
was
no
reasonable
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
--
and
probable
cause
in
the
boyd
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
when
you
take
the
two
together,
i'd
say
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
--
as
the
boyd
case
is
distinguished
from
this
one.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
no,
your
honor.
we'd
come
back
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
is
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
when
we
say
that's
limited
by
the
cases
to
oral
compulsion.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
oral
compulsion
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
i'm
sorry
your
honor
we're
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
your
honor,
which
is
why
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
when
the
--
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
we
see
it
is
now
refers
to
testimonial
evidence,
and
not
to
non-testimonial
evidence.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
no,
i
don't.
but
i'd
say
that
has
to
be
oral
statement
from
his
lips
that
are
tantamount
to
an
admission
or
a
confession.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
well,
your
honor
that
seems
to
be
the
law
today.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
no,
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
davenport
your
honor,
that
wouldn't
be
reasonable
again,
any
other
questions
(voice
overlap),
no
other
questions?
thank
you
very
much.
