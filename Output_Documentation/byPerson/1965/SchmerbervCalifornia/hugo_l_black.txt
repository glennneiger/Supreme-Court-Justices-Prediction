justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
dispute
as
to
whether
the
blood
was
taken
in
order
to
test
it,
to
use
as
evidence
against
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
if
you're
relying
on
rochin,
you
didn't
quite
state
all
the
tests,
is
it
“shock
the
conscience”
of
the
english-speaking
world?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
opinion
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you've
contested
no
ordinary
layman's
language.
would
you
say
that
they
did
or
did
not
compel
him
to
give
the
blood?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
he
submit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
it
just
plain
words
to
say
he
didn't
--
they
didn't
compel
him
to
that
amount
of
blood?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
use
it
as
evidence
against
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
had
to
compel
to
give
his
blood
against
his
consent
so
that
the
state
can
use
it
as
evidence
against
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
(inaudible)
it
seems
to
me
like
you
practically
had
enough
without
all
of
these
--
going
to
this
trouble.
but
what
you
have
is
that
--
is
you
haven't
used
the
word,
you
haven't
mentioned
the
word
compel.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
--
you've
mentioned
about
unreasonableness
according
to
the
laws
of
rules
of
decency
of
the
civilized
world,
but
you
haven't
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
fifth
amendment
says
the
man
shall
not
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
you
mentioned
malloy
and
hogan
which
says
that's
applicable
to
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
what
you
have
here,
that
he
was
compelled
to
give
blood
against
his
consent
for
the
purpose
of
using
it
as
evidence
against
him,
in
the
trial
against
him,
and
that's
correct?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
as
such
might
be
perfect
and
reasonable,
might
it
not,
and
still
if
you
search
and
you've
got
evidence
against
the
man
which
he
objected
(inaudible),
you
would
have
another
problem
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
true
in
the
boyd
case
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
concurring
opinion
says
it
was
not
tantamount
to
a
search.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
didn't
both
the
concurring
opinion
and
the
majority
opinion
rely
on
its
admissibility
of
evidence
--
in
the
admissibility
of
evidence,
on
the
fact
that
it
compelled
them
to
give
evidence
against
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
the
majority
and
the
minority
--
didn't
it
--
the
gentleman
who
wrote
the
--
the
judge
who
wrote
for
the
majority,
whether
it's
a
judge
who
wrote
the
concurring
opinion
--
then
so
far
as
the
inadmissibility
of
that
evidence
was
concerned,
on
the
fact
that
it
compelled
him
to
produce
evidence
against
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
boyd
also
being,
that
the
fact
they've
summoned
him
to
bring
papers,
it
was
compelling
him
to
give
witness
against
--
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
in
the
boyd's
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
mean
that
we
have
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
be
reasonable
then
to
--
into
compelling
a
man
to
be
a
witness
against
himself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
must
be
a
reasonable
compelling?
justice
hugo
l.
black
forget
the
boyd
case,
i'm
interested
in
the
fact
that
as
long
as
you'd
take
it,
you
tell
the
man
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
apparently,
if
you
do
it
reasonably,
then
it
doesn't
violate
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oral
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it?
that
it's
limited
to
oral
compulsion,
what
about
taking
papers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
asking
him
to
turnover
the
paper.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
couldn't
be
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
is
testimonial
except
giving
something
to
be
used
against
him,
you
don't
claim
he
has
to
give
it
in
the
court,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
gives
up
his
--
if
he
gives
up
--
if
you
make
him
give
up
something
else
and
convict
him,
that's
alright?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
that's
a
contraband,
maybe
that's
the
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
taking
of
the
blood
is
contraband
because
it
has
liquor
in
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
dispute
as
to
whether
the
evidence
was
--
whether
the
blood
was
taken?
justice
