mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
a
case
which
arose
in
the
san
fernando
valley,
county
of
los
angeles
wherein
the
defendant
was
driving
an
automobile
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
midnight
and
struck
a
tree.
the
defendant
actually
--
or
the
petitioner
denied
the
fact
that
he
was
driving
a
car,
but
it
was
held
that
he
had
in
fact
then
driving
the
car.
sometimes
subsequent
to
the
petitioner
exiting
from
the
car,
two
police
officers
arrived
at
the
scene
--
one
of
them
observed
the
petitioner
standing
by
an
ambulance
and
then
the
petitioner
was
placed
in
the
ambulance
and
transported
to
a
hospital.
at
the
hospital,
the
officer
who
had
observed
the
petitioner
at
the
scene,
inquired
of
the
passenger
of
the
car
and
talked
with
the
petitioner
and
asked
the
petitioner
whether
or
not
he
would
be
willing
to
take
a
breathalyzer
test
to
which
the
petitioner
said
no.
the
officer
asked
him
whether
or
no
he
would
be
willing
to
take
a
blood
test,
according
to
the
officer,
the
petitioner
said
yes
and
the
officer
went
out
to
obtain
a
doctor
and
a
nurse.
but
when
the
doctor
and
the
nurse
returned,
the
petitioner
then
stated
no,
he
would
not
take
a
blood
test
because
his
attorney
had
told
him
not
to
submit
to
such
a
test.
the
petitioner
in
his
testimony
or
in
his
affidavit
indicated
that
he
always
refused
to
take
the
test.
but,
be
that
as
it
may,
the
officer
then
went
out,
spoke
to
his
superior
officer
who
apparently
directed
him
to
proceed
with
the
test
anyway,
and
the
officer
advised
the
doctor
to
proceed
and
to
extract
blood
from
the
petitioner.
the
blood
was
taken
and
the
los
angeles
police
officer
chemist
ran
an
analysis
on
the
blood
test
or
blood,
and
arrived
at
a
reading
of
0.18
which
the
chemist
testified
to
would
indicate
that
a
person
was
at
the
alcohol
reading
--
at
the
time,
he
would
be
under
the
influence
of
intoxicating
liquor.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no,
there
was
no
struggle.
the
defendant
stipulated
at
the
trial
that
it
was
administered
in
a
orderly
fashion.
and
also
though
in
the
affidavit
of
the
defendant,
if
this
may
become
an
issue
as
far
as
your
honor
is
concerned,
the
fact
is
that
the
defendant
had
a
broken
leg
or
ankle
and
one
fractured
rib
and
was
--
and
have
various
lacerations
on
his
body
and
he
told
the
police,
“i
won't
fight
with
you
but
i
don't
want
you
to
take
test
in
essence.”
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes.
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
fact
that
he
said,
“don't,
my
attorney
told
me
not
to.”
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
that's
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no,
it
was
taken
on
the
direction
of
the
police
officer.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no.
there
was
apparently
no
question
relative
at
that
time
to
any
injury
which
would
necessitate
the
removal
of
blood
and
there
was
never
any
testimony
anywhere
in
the
case
or
any
indication
that
it
was
for
any
other
purpose
other
than
the
purpose
of
extracting
the
blood
for
the
blood
alcohol
test,
because
in
the
officer's
testimony,
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
he
said
that
--
for
the
first
time,
he
said
this,
that
he
asked
him
first
with
a
breathalyzer
test
which
the
defendant
refused
and
then
he
followed
that
with
immediately
with
the
request
for
the
blood.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no,
he
was
conscious
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
was
unconscious,
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
in
breithaupt
i
--
when
i
read
the
case,
probably
50
times,
i
don't
recall
that
particular
aspects
your
honor,
whether
or
not
that
was
an
ordinary
course
of
the
hospital
routine.
i
really
honestly
don't
recall
that.
but
i
have
to
point
of
course,
i
think
it
was
important,
the
fact
that
the
defendant
in
that
case
was
unconscious
although
i
--
still
i
don't
really
feel
that
that
should
be
the
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
not
necessarily.
i'm
requesting
that
your
court
do
that
because
i
feel
that
recent
decisions
and
actually
reason
require
it,
but
as
far
as
actuality
in
making
a
decision
in
reversing
this
case,
this
court
could
reverse
and
very
well
distinguish
it
from
breithaupt
by
reason
of
the
consciousness
or
unconsciousness
of
the
individual
involved.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
your
honor,
of
course,
i'm
not
a
medical
doctor
but
i
know
from
mere
practice
that
if
one
takes
blood
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
individual
needs
certain
type
of
medical
attention,
one
of
the
test
that
is
run
is
not
an
alcoholic
test
to
determine
the
alcoholic
content
of
the
blood.
other
tests
are
run
such
as
blood
count
or
if
it's
a
wassermann
test
to
determine
if
the
individual
has
venereal
disease.
but
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
--
there
is
no
necessity
for
running
an
alcohol
content
test
on
a
blood
sample
if
one
is
doing
it
for
the
sole
purpose
of
medical
care.
so
i
think
that's
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no,
not
if
you're
running
a
blood
count.
it
only
shows
up
when
you
run
certain
analysis
on
the
blood
sample
itself
for
the
sole
purpose
of
determining
how
much
alcohol
remains
in
the
sample
that
the
--
an
analyst
uses.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
i
beg
your
–-
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
there
has
never
been
--
no,
your
honor,
there
has
never
been
any
dispute
in
this
case
at
all
about
that.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
well
again,
i
--
i'm
not
really
sure
about
that
point
your
honor.
as
i
say,
i
don't
recall
that
particular
aspect
of
it
but
i
--
if
i
may,
i
can
probably
get
into
my
point
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
thank
you.
the
trial
court
and
my
motion
for
suppression
denied
the
motion
previous
to
the
trial,
and
the
motion
for
suppression
included
the
motion
to
suppress
any
testimony
or
evidence
relative
to
the
fact
that
the
defendant
refused
to
take
the
blood
test
as
well
as
the
actual
fact
that
the
blood
test
was
administered
and
the
analysis
resulted.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
same
motion
was
renewed
and
again
denied.
basically,
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
entry
into
the
body
of
a
accused,
by
law
enforcement
or
police
officers,
per
se
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
and
also
constitutes
a
violation
of
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
prohibition
against
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
in
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no.
(voice
overlap)
no,
it's
judicial
decision.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
the
legislature
has
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes,
they
do
indeed,
the
variations
on
the
percentage
of
alcohol
is
required.
it
would
probably
be
easier
to
--
i
think
write
an
opinion,
no
reflection
on
the
court,
but
these
particular
points
of
due
process,
self-incrimination,
and
search
and
seizure
in
some
cases,
such
as
this,
that
they
kind
of
run
into
each
other
and
it's
difficult
to
differentiate.
but
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
take
the
theory
of
due
process
and
say
that
when
law
enforcement
agencies,
take
it
upon
themselves
which
they
did
in
this
case,
they
instructed
the
doctor
to
remove
the
blood.
when
they
take
it
upon
themselves
to
invade
the
body
of
an
individual
who's
accused
of
a
crime
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
evidence
from
him
to
utilize
in
the
trial,
to
prosecute
him,
and
convict
him,
that
this
constitutes
a
violation
of
due
process.
now
when
the
constitution
was
enacted,
there
were
no
blood
test
to
my
knowledge.
there
was
bloodletting
but
no
blood
test,
no
analysis
that
could
be
run
on
blood.
so
when
the
framers
of
our
constitution
said
due
process,
they
had
to
say
--
it
means
something
--
that
was
to
be
a
living
non-static
thing.
now,
in
our
society,
we
have
enumerable
methods
of
ascertaining
particular
characteristics
of
an
individual,
for
instance
the
nalline
test
injected
into
an
individual
whether
or
not
his
pupils
dilate
indicate
that
he
is
then
under
the
influence
of
a
narcotic.
we
have
the
blood
test.
we
have
the
wassermann
test.
we
have
enumerable
means
now
of
looking
into
a
person's
body
by
entering
in
the
body
and
ascertaining
certain
things.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
not
per
se,
no
it
does
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
that
is
correct,
right.
a
different
issue
might
arise
and
relative
to
the
force
utilized
if
it
was
utilized
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no,
not
unless
we
have
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
that's
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
that
is
correct,
yes
your
honor.
so
that
when
we
determine
whether
or
not
in
a
case
such
as
this,
due
process
prohibits
this
type
of
conduct.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
our
society
today
in
the
light
of
such
things
as
a
hydrogen
bomb
and
comparing
it
with
--
at
the
time
due
process
was
enacted,
what
type
of
lighting
was
used,
whale
oil
or
something.
nowadays,
we
have
the
--
the
problems
of
the
individual,
the
problems
of
society,
the
advances
of
science,
so
that
we
have
to
say,
doesn't
due
process
really,
really
include
a
prohibition
against
the
police
using
the
body
--
the
inside
portion
of
the
body,
of
an
individual
for
the
purpose
of
convicting
him.
he
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
i
would
hate
to
say
that
that
should
be
a
basis
for
making
a
constitutional
decision.
i
feel
that
way
your
honor.
and
maybe
i
will
argue
the
other
way
if
--
if
it
were
presented
to
me
in
a
different
way.
but
i
feel
that
we
can't
say,
“well
look,
if
we
have
to
cut
down
and
slaughter
the
highway
so
therefore
let's
--
just
kind
of
ignore
a
certain
aspect
of
the
constitution.”
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
constitution
and
say,
doesn't
the
state
have
to
adhere
to
the
provisions
of
the
constitution?
they
just
--
must
do
more
expeditious
police
work
and
there's
nothing
that
says
if
a
defendant
doesn't
consent,
i
mean
that
if
he
does
consent
they
can
utilize
it.
this
is
the
case
of
no
consent.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
it
--
may
i
say
that
--
in
most
cases
that
i've
tried,
it
depends
on
who's
testifying
and
whether
or
not
that
particular
law
enforcement
agency
is
utilizing
the
blood
test
exclusively
or
utilizing
the
breathalyzer
test.
i've
had
the
same
expert
testify
that
when
they
were
using
a
breathalyzer,
that
it
was
--
that
the
--
or
when
they're
using
the
blood
test,
that
that
was
the
most
accurate.
then
when
they
use
the
breathalyzer
they
say,
“well,
that's
the
equivalent
of
accuracy.”
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
i
would
think
the
experts
i've
spoken
to
would
probably
say
off
the
witness
stand
that
the
blood
test
is
more
reliable.
and
that
a
tissue
test
from
the
brain
is
the
most
reliable
but
of
course,
that's
difficult
on
a
living
individual.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
never
had
a
court
disallow
it
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
it
was
deemed
inadequate
or
inaccurate.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
it
would
be
a
practical
difficulty
to
administer
a
breathalyzer,
it
would
be
really
a
problem
in
forcing
an
individual
to
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no,
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
right.
but
they
--
in
a
breathalyzer
test,
one
has
to
blow
into
a
tube
which
then
goes
into
a
machine
so
a
certain
amount
of
breath
has
to
be
exhaled
--
exhaled
through
the
tube
to
get
into
the
machine
and
it
might
cause
a
more
practical
problem.
so,
i
think
that
might
be
one
of
the
reasons.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
now,
in
rochin,
it
seems
that
when
this
court
discussed
rochin
and
the
breithaupt
case,
that
it
actually
limited
rochin
to
a
case
of
brutal
or
offensive
conduct
which
in
reading
rochin,
i
don't
believe
it's
necessarily,
the
conclusion
that
one
must
reach.
i
think
that
in
reading
frankfurter's
decision
in
rochin,
we
can
observe
that
he
discussed
interpreting
constitutional
phrases
and
he
said
that
some
of
the
phrases
have
been
fixed
by
a
gloss,
which
is
a
phrase
i
think
he
used,
and
that
we
are
in
effect
held
to
this
interpretation.
but
that
in
cases
where
the
constitutional
provision,
and
i
think
such
as
due
process
and
fixed
with
a
permanent
gloss,
that
we
must
look
at
and
he
said,
“when
the
gloss
has
thus
not
been
fixed
but
is
a
function
of
the
process
of
judgment,
the
judgment
is
bound
to
fall
differently
at
different
times
and
differently
at
the
same
time
through
different
judges.”
and
this
to
me
is
more
of
a
proper
and
correct
analysis
of
the
rochin
case,
and
to
say
that
--
to
violate
due
process
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned,
one
must
physically
and
brutally
take
the
evidence
from
the
individual.
as
i
indicated
i
think
in
my
brief,
if
this
individual,
schmerber,
had
fought
with
the
officer
with
his
broken
leg
and
his
fractured
rib
and
his
sutured
mouth,
number
one,
i
would
say
it
would
have
been
painful.
number
two,
he
would
have
been
then
possibly
subjected
to
punishment
for
violating
some
of
california
statutes
involving
resisting
arrest
and
the
punishment
meted
by
--
out
by
the
judge,
would
or
could
have
been
more
severe,
so
that
it
seems
strange
to
say
that
--
if
this
court
holds,
“well,
the
police
have
the
right
to
do
this
as
long
as
they
don't
beat
you
up.”
then
logically,
wouldn't
i
have
to
return
to
california
or
to
any
state
in
effect
and
say
to
a
client
that,
that
you're
not
entitled
to
due
process
under
our
constitution
unless
you
fight
for
your
rights
and
possibly
shed
blood
one
way
or
the
other.
it
--
to
me,
it
doesn't
seem
logical.
and
where
is
the
point
of
no
return
on
the
insertion
of
the
needle.
for
example,
is
the
mere
insertion
of
the
needle
into
the
arm,
we
say,
“that's
all
right.”
what
if
the
individual
withdraws
the
arm
as
we've
done
in
duroncelay,
people
versus
duroncelay
where
the
court
said
that
was
a
reasonable
search
in
california
and
that
that
was
okay.
but
what
if
he
withdrew
it
three
times?
would
it
take
three
times
for
the
withdrawal
and
the
insertion
of
the
needle
before
this
court
would
then
say,
“well
now
this
--
this
is
a
violation
of
due
process
because
it's
not
fair
to
have
been
stuck
three
times.”
i
don't
think
that
distinction
is
a
logical
distinction.
i
think
it
must
--
will
fall
more
definitely
and
basically
that
the
insertion
of
a
needle
into
the
body,
the
performance
of
the
surgery
on
an
individual
constitutes
the
violation.
or
otherwise,
i
think
we'll
then
have
to
resort
to
the
premise
that
he's
taken
--
withdraw
blood
from
the
body
which
the
blood
is
in
contraband,
it
belongs
to
the
individual.
it's
not
like
a
narcotic
--
it's
his
own
blood.
it's
not
a
gun
that
was
used
in
a
burglary
or
a
robbery
which
is
out
in
the
exterior
of
the
individual.
it's
something
which
is
his.
then
why
can't
the
state,
if
we
conclude
that
due
process
doesn't
prohibit
this,
why
can't
a
state
then
insert
a
needle
and
inject
nalline
into
any
individual
who
was
arrested
and
who
appears
to
be
either
one
under
the
influence
of
intoxicating
beverages
or
a
narcotic.
they'll
take
out
so
many
cc's
of
blood
and
stick
in
so
many
cc's
of
nalline.
i
think
it
follows
if
this
court
holds
that
it's
proper
to
withdraw
the
blood
that
is
certainly
just
as
proper
to
inject
the
nalline
if
we're
looking
at
the
welfare
of
society
and
how
we
want
to
keep
narcotic
users
off
the
street.
so,
i
feel
that
this
court
in
determining
the
issue
really
should
conclude
that
the
due
process
clause
does
prohibit
the
invasion
of
the
body
in
this
manner.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
none,
they've
stipulated
that.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
now,
the
next
point
is
the
question
of
self-incriminations
and
i
feel
that
although
this
court
and
many
other
courts
are
--
the
majority
of
this
court
have
held
in
the
past
that
self-incrimination
basically
only
applies
to
testimonial
compulsion
and
not
to
“real
evidence”
that
nevertheless
in
this
type
of
case
it
seems
analogous
to
a
situation
whereby
some
type
of
force
or
some
subtle
means,
the
law
enforcement
agency
extracts
a
confession
or
an
admission
out
of
the
defendant.
now,
this
court
has
held
that
that's
a
violation
of
due
process
yet
that
the
exact
and
sole
purpose
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
blood
in
this
case
to
be
used
against
the
defendant
and
in
obviously,
incrimination,
and
the
breithaupt
citation
in
the
duroncelay
and
california
all
talk
about
the
efficacy
of
the
blood
sample
in
proving
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
pardon?
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
your
honor,
i
submit
the
same
argument
--
argument
can
be
utilized
to
a
confession
because
we're
--
in
the
argument
your
honor
is
assuming
it's
confession,
let's
say
the
law
enforcement
officers
used
force
against
the
defendant
and
he
admits
certain
facts,
doesn't
constitute
a
confession
but
he
admits
certain
circumstantial
facts
which
in
the
web
of
the
whole
case
enables
a
conviction
or
result.
and
yet
as
far
as
that
the
defendant
is
concerned,
and
as
far
as
your
honor
might
be
concerned,
there
are
exculpatory
facts.
yet
it
would
still
be
excluded
because
it
was
a
violation
of
due
process
and
it
violates
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
that's
right.
and
the
same
thing
can
be
said,
i
think,
of
the
officer
who
breaks
down
the
door,
smashes
into
a
house
because
he
didn't
have
a
search
warrant
but
he
heard
someone
had
narcotics,
and
he
looks
through
the
house
and
lo
and
behold,
he
finds
no
narcotics.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no,
but
again
--
you
have
to
start
all
over
the
premise.
is
it
or
isn't
it
a
violation
of
due
process,
because
when
someone
breaks
down
a
door
to
go
into
someone's
house,
you
don't
know
beforehand
whether
you're
going
to
find
something
there.
the
violation
of
the
constitution
occurs
when
the
door
is
broken
down.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
the
violation
of
constitution
occurs
when
the
needle
is
inserted.
now,
that
to
me
is
the
point
where
you
have
to
make
a
decision
not
afterwards
when
you
determine
whether
or
not
something
bad
is
found
or
something
good
is
found
depending
upon
which
side
you
are.
so
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
not
at
this
point,
i
certainly
wouldn't
because
i
think
there's
a
big
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
not
the
argument
--
not
completely
extend
to
it,
no,
i'm
sure
i
could
stand
up
here
and
make
that
argument
but
i
certainly
wouldn't
be
as
convinced
of
it
as
i
am
at
this
particular
point
because
in,
one,
you
have
the
invasion
of
the
body
which
i
think
is
a
big
distinguishing
feature.
and
the
other,
you
have
--
the
forcing
of
an
individual
to
do
something
with
an
exterior
portion
of
his
body
--
standing
up
or
giving
the
fingerprints.
and
i
think
another
distinguishing
factor
is
the
fact
that
in
fingerprinting
you
have
a
tremendous
problem
in
our
country
of
identification.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
well,
i
think
the
counsel
should
be
present
in
a
police
line
up.i
didn't
feel
that
that's
a
constitutional
requirement.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no.
but
there
are
statutes,
which
authorizes
the
utilization
of
nalline
if
the
defendant
consents
to
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
there's
no
such
statute
which
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
absolutely.
the
doctor
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
doctor
and
the
officers
are
both
responsible
for
the
tort,
definitely.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
i
see
--
alright,
yes,
you're
right.
i
would
say
i
--
i
have
a
feeling
relative
to
the
fact
that
this
--
the
state
law
of
course
is
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
that
is
correct.
and
the
other
point
of
course
is
the
fact
that
a
search
and
seizure
made
after
a
lawful
arrest,
and
i'm
not
arguing
the
lawfulness
of
the
arrest,
search
and
seizure
must
be
reasonable.
again,
i
say
that
i
don't
see
how
a
puncturing
of
the
skin
or
an
entry
into
the
body
can
be
deemed
reasonable.
the
searching
of
the
individual's
clothes,
the
searching
of
the
immediate
area
has
been
held
to
be
reasonable.
but
the
entry
into
his
body,
i
submit,
is
not
reasonable
and
i
think
that
both
the
fifth
and
fourth
really
run
together
here
when
we
talk
about
search
and
seizure
and
about
self-incrimination,
that
they
run
together
here,
and
result
in
a
conclusion
that
it's
improper
to
make
this
type
of
entry.
and
additionally,
whether
or
not
the
court
really
feels
this
point
as
important
that
--
it's
a
point
that's
raised
so
frequently
in
california,
giving
the
instruction
to
the
jury
that
they
can
consider
the
fact
that
the
defendant
refused
to
give
breath
test
or
a
blood
test.
i
think,
if
the
court
decides
that
the
individual
has
the
constitutional
right
to
refuse,
for
example
the
blood
test,
that
then
it
is
improper
and
a
violation
of
griffin
versus
california
to
enable
the
court
to
comment
to
the
jury
on
it
and
enable
the
jury
to
draw
a
conclusion
from
that
fact.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no,
i
think,
if
your
honors
ask
questions
i
--
very
well.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
a
case
which
arose
in
the
san
fernando
valley,
county
of
los
angeles
wherein
the
defendant
was
driving
an
automobile
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
midnight
and
struck
a
tree.
the
defendant
actually
--
or
the
petitioner
denied
the
fact
that
he
was
driving
a
car,
but
it
was
held
that
he
had
in
fact
then
driving
the
car.
sometimes
subsequent
to
the
petitioner
exiting
from
the
car,
two
police
officers
arrived
at
the
scene
--
one
of
them
observed
the
petitioner
standing
by
an
ambulance
and
then
the
petitioner
was
placed
in
the
ambulance
and
transported
to
a
hospital.
at
the
hospital,
the
officer
who
had
observed
the
petitioner
at
the
scene,
inquired
of
the
passenger
of
the
car
and
talked
with
the
petitioner
and
asked
the
petitioner
whether
or
not
he
would
be
willing
to
take
a
breathalyzer
test
to
which
the
petitioner
said
no.
the
officer
asked
him
whether
or
no
he
would
be
willing
to
take
a
blood
test,
according
to
the
officer,
the
petitioner
said
yes
and
the
officer
went
out
to
obtain
a
doctor
and
a
nurse.
but
when
the
doctor
and
the
nurse
returned,
the
petitioner
then
stated
no,
he
would
not
take
a
blood
test
because
his
attorney
had
told
him
not
to
submit
to
such
a
test.
the
petitioner
in
his
testimony
or
in
his
affidavit
indicated
that
he
always
refused
to
take
the
test.
but,
be
that
as
it
may,
the
officer
then
went
out,
spoke
to
his
superior
officer
who
apparently
directed
him
to
proceed
with
the
test
anyway,
and
the
officer
advised
the
doctor
to
proceed
and
to
extract
blood
from
the
petitioner.
the
blood
was
taken
and
the
los
angeles
police
officer
chemist
ran
an
analysis
on
the
blood
test
or
blood,
and
arrived
at
a
reading
of
0.18
which
the
chemist
testified
to
would
indicate
that
a
person
was
at
the
alcohol
reading
--
at
the
time,
he
would
be
under
the
influence
of
intoxicating
liquor.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no,
there
was
no
struggle.
the
defendant
stipulated
at
the
trial
that
it
was
administered
in
a
orderly
fashion.
and
also
though
in
the
affidavit
of
the
defendant,
if
this
may
become
an
issue
as
far
as
your
honor
is
concerned,
the
fact
is
that
the
defendant
had
a
broken
leg
or
ankle
and
one
fractured
rib
and
was
--
and
have
various
lacerations
on
his
body
and
he
told
the
police,
“i
won't
fight
with
you
but
i
don't
want
you
to
take
test
in
essence.”
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes.
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
fact
that
he
said,
“don't,
my
attorney
told
me
not
to.”
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
that's
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no,
it
was
taken
on
the
direction
of
the
police
officer.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no.
there
was
apparently
no
question
relative
at
that
time
to
any
injury
which
would
necessitate
the
removal
of
blood
and
there
was
never
any
testimony
anywhere
in
the
case
or
any
indication
that
it
was
for
any
other
purpose
other
than
the
purpose
of
extracting
the
blood
for
the
blood
alcohol
test,
because
in
the
officer's
testimony,
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
he
said
that
--
for
the
first
time,
he
said
this,
that
he
asked
him
first
with
a
breathalyzer
test
which
the
defendant
refused
and
then
he
followed
that
with
immediately
with
the
request
for
the
blood.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no,
he
was
conscious
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
was
unconscious,
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
in
breithaupt
i
--
when
i
read
the
case,
probably
50
times,
i
don't
recall
that
particular
aspects
your
honor,
whether
or
not
that
was
an
ordinary
course
of
the
hospital
routine.
i
really
honestly
don't
recall
that.
but
i
have
to
point
of
course,
i
think
it
was
important,
the
fact
that
the
defendant
in
that
case
was
unconscious
although
i
--
still
i
don't
really
feel
that
that
should
be
the
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
not
necessarily.
i'm
requesting
that
your
court
do
that
because
i
feel
that
recent
decisions
and
actually
reason
require
it,
but
as
far
as
actuality
in
making
a
decision
in
reversing
this
case,
this
court
could
reverse
and
very
well
distinguish
it
from
breithaupt
by
reason
of
the
consciousness
or
unconsciousness
of
the
individual
involved.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
your
honor,
of
course,
i'm
not
a
medical
doctor
but
i
know
from
mere
practice
that
if
one
takes
blood
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
individual
needs
certain
type
of
medical
attention,
one
of
the
test
that
is
run
is
not
an
alcoholic
test
to
determine
the
alcoholic
content
of
the
blood.
other
tests
are
run
such
as
blood
count
or
if
it's
a
wassermann
test
to
determine
if
the
individual
has
venereal
disease.
but
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
--
there
is
no
necessity
for
running
an
alcohol
content
test
on
a
blood
sample
if
one
is
doing
it
for
the
sole
purpose
of
medical
care.
so
i
think
that's
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no,
not
if
you're
running
a
blood
count.
it
only
shows
up
when
you
run
certain
analysis
on
the
blood
sample
itself
for
the
sole
purpose
of
determining
how
much
alcohol
remains
in
the
sample
that
the
--
an
analyst
uses.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
i
beg
your
–-
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
there
has
never
been
--
no,
your
honor,
there
has
never
been
any
dispute
in
this
case
at
all
about
that.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
well
again,
i
--
i'm
not
really
sure
about
that
point
your
honor.
as
i
say,
i
don't
recall
that
particular
aspect
of
it
but
i
--
if
i
may,
i
can
probably
get
into
my
point
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
thank
you.
the
trial
court
and
my
motion
for
suppression
denied
the
motion
previous
to
the
trial,
and
the
motion
for
suppression
included
the
motion
to
suppress
any
testimony
or
evidence
relative
to
the
fact
that
the
defendant
refused
to
take
the
blood
test
as
well
as
the
actual
fact
that
the
blood
test
was
administered
and
the
analysis
resulted.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
same
motion
was
renewed
and
again
denied.
basically,
the
petitioner
contends
that
the
entry
into
the
body
of
a
accused,
by
law
enforcement
or
police
officers,
per
se
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
and
also
constitutes
a
violation
of
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
prohibition
against
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
in
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no.
(voice
overlap)
no,
it's
judicial
decision.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
the
legislature
has
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes,
they
do
indeed,
the
variations
on
the
percentage
of
alcohol
is
required.
it
would
probably
be
easier
to
--
i
think
write
an
opinion,
no
reflection
on
the
court,
but
these
particular
points
of
due
process,
self-incrimination,
and
search
and
seizure
in
some
cases,
such
as
this,
that
they
kind
of
run
into
each
other
and
it's
difficult
to
differentiate.
but
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
take
the
theory
of
due
process
and
say
that
when
law
enforcement
agencies,
take
it
upon
themselves
which
they
did
in
this
case,
they
instructed
the
doctor
to
remove
the
blood.
when
they
take
it
upon
themselves
to
invade
the
body
of
an
individual
who's
accused
of
a
crime
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
evidence
from
him
to
utilize
in
the
trial,
to
prosecute
him,
and
convict
him,
that
this
constitutes
a
violation
of
due
process.
now
when
the
constitution
was
enacted,
there
were
no
blood
test
to
my
knowledge.
there
was
bloodletting
but
no
blood
test,
no
analysis
that
could
be
run
on
blood.
so
when
the
framers
of
our
constitution
said
due
process,
they
had
to
say
--
it
means
something
--
that
was
to
be
a
living
non-static
thing.
now,
in
our
society,
we
have
enumerable
methods
of
ascertaining
particular
characteristics
of
an
individual,
for
instance
the
nalline
test
injected
into
an
individual
whether
or
not
his
pupils
dilate
indicate
that
he
is
then
under
the
influence
of
a
narcotic.
we
have
the
blood
test.
we
have
the
wassermann
test.
we
have
enumerable
means
now
of
looking
into
a
person's
body
by
entering
in
the
body
and
ascertaining
certain
things.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
not
per
se,
no
it
does
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
that
is
correct,
right.
a
different
issue
might
arise
and
relative
to
the
force
utilized
if
it
was
utilized
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no,
not
unless
we
have
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
that's
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
that
is
correct,
yes
your
honor.
so
that
when
we
determine
whether
or
not
in
a
case
such
as
this,
due
process
prohibits
this
type
of
conduct.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
our
society
today
in
the
light
of
such
things
as
a
hydrogen
bomb
and
comparing
it
with
--
at
the
time
due
process
was
enacted,
what
type
of
lighting
was
used,
whale
oil
or
something.
nowadays,
we
have
the
--
the
problems
of
the
individual,
the
problems
of
society,
the
advances
of
science,
so
that
we
have
to
say,
doesn't
due
process
really,
really
include
a
prohibition
against
the
police
using
the
body
--
the
inside
portion
of
the
body,
of
an
individual
for
the
purpose
of
convicting
him.
he
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
i
would
hate
to
say
that
that
should
be
a
basis
for
making
a
constitutional
decision.
i
feel
that
way
your
honor.
and
maybe
i
will
argue
the
other
way
if
--
if
it
were
presented
to
me
in
a
different
way.
but
i
feel
that
we
can't
say,
“well
look,
if
we
have
to
cut
down
and
slaughter
the
highway
so
therefore
let's
--
just
kind
of
ignore
a
certain
aspect
of
the
constitution.”
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
constitution
and
say,
doesn't
the
state
have
to
adhere
to
the
provisions
of
the
constitution?
they
just
--
must
do
more
expeditious
police
work
and
there's
nothing
that
says
if
a
defendant
doesn't
consent,
i
mean
that
if
he
does
consent
they
can
utilize
it.
this
is
the
case
of
no
consent.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
it
--
may
i
say
that
--
in
most
cases
that
i've
tried,
it
depends
on
who's
testifying
and
whether
or
not
that
particular
law
enforcement
agency
is
utilizing
the
blood
test
exclusively
or
utilizing
the
breathalyzer
test.
i've
had
the
same
expert
testify
that
when
they
were
using
a
breathalyzer,
that
it
was
--
that
the
--
or
when
they're
using
the
blood
test,
that
that
was
the
most
accurate.
then
when
they
use
the
breathalyzer
they
say,
“well,
that's
the
equivalent
of
accuracy.”
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
i
would
think
the
experts
i've
spoken
to
would
probably
say
off
the
witness
stand
that
the
blood
test
is
more
reliable.
and
that
a
tissue
test
from
the
brain
is
the
most
reliable
but
of
course,
that's
difficult
on
a
living
individual.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
never
had
a
court
disallow
it
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
it
was
deemed
inadequate
or
inaccurate.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
it
would
be
a
practical
difficulty
to
administer
a
breathalyzer,
it
would
be
really
a
problem
in
forcing
an
individual
to
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no,
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
right.
but
they
--
in
a
breathalyzer
test,
one
has
to
blow
into
a
tube
which
then
goes
into
a
machine
so
a
certain
amount
of
breath
has
to
be
exhaled
--
exhaled
through
the
tube
to
get
into
the
machine
and
it
might
cause
a
more
practical
problem.
so,
i
think
that
might
be
one
of
the
reasons.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
now,
in
rochin,
it
seems
that
when
this
court
discussed
rochin
and
the
breithaupt
case,
that
it
actually
limited
rochin
to
a
case
of
brutal
or
offensive
conduct
which
in
reading
rochin,
i
don't
believe
it's
necessarily,
the
conclusion
that
one
must
reach.
i
think
that
in
reading
frankfurter's
decision
in
rochin,
we
can
observe
that
he
discussed
interpreting
constitutional
phrases
and
he
said
that
some
of
the
phrases
have
been
fixed
by
a
gloss,
which
is
a
phrase
i
think
he
used,
and
that
we
are
in
effect
held
to
this
interpretation.
but
that
in
cases
where
the
constitutional
provision,
and
i
think
such
as
due
process
and
fixed
with
a
permanent
gloss,
that
we
must
look
at
and
he
said,
“when
the
gloss
has
thus
not
been
fixed
but
is
a
function
of
the
process
of
judgment,
the
judgment
is
bound
to
fall
differently
at
different
times
and
differently
at
the
same
time
through
different
judges.”
and
this
to
me
is
more
of
a
proper
and
correct
analysis
of
the
rochin
case,
and
to
say
that
--
to
violate
due
process
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned,
one
must
physically
and
brutally
take
the
evidence
from
the
individual.
as
i
indicated
i
think
in
my
brief,
if
this
individual,
schmerber,
had
fought
with
the
officer
with
his
broken
leg
and
his
fractured
rib
and
his
sutured
mouth,
number
one,
i
would
say
it
would
have
been
painful.
number
two,
he
would
have
been
then
possibly
subjected
to
punishment
for
violating
some
of
california
statutes
involving
resisting
arrest
and
the
punishment
meted
by
--
out
by
the
judge,
would
or
could
have
been
more
severe,
so
that
it
seems
strange
to
say
that
--
if
this
court
holds,
“well,
the
police
have
the
right
to
do
this
as
long
as
they
don't
beat
you
up.”
then
logically,
wouldn't
i
have
to
return
to
california
or
to
any
state
in
effect
and
say
to
a
client
that,
that
you're
not
entitled
to
due
process
under
our
constitution
unless
you
fight
for
your
rights
and
possibly
shed
blood
one
way
or
the
other.
it
--
to
me,
it
doesn't
seem
logical.
and
where
is
the
point
of
no
return
on
the
insertion
of
the
needle.
for
example,
is
the
mere
insertion
of
the
needle
into
the
arm,
we
say,
“that's
all
right.”
what
if
the
individual
withdraws
the
arm
as
we've
done
in
duroncelay,
people
versus
duroncelay
where
the
court
said
that
was
a
reasonable
search
in
california
and
that
that
was
okay.
but
what
if
he
withdrew
it
three
times?
would
it
take
three
times
for
the
withdrawal
and
the
insertion
of
the
needle
before
this
court
would
then
say,
“well
now
this
--
this
is
a
violation
of
due
process
because
it's
not
fair
to
have
been
stuck
three
times.”
i
don't
think
that
distinction
is
a
logical
distinction.
i
think
it
must
--
will
fall
more
definitely
and
basically
that
the
insertion
of
a
needle
into
the
body,
the
performance
of
the
surgery
on
an
individual
constitutes
the
violation.
or
otherwise,
i
think
we'll
then
have
to
resort
to
the
premise
that
he's
taken
--
withdraw
blood
from
the
body
which
the
blood
is
in
contraband,
it
belongs
to
the
individual.
it's
not
like
a
narcotic
--
it's
his
own
blood.
it's
not
a
gun
that
was
used
in
a
burglary
or
a
robbery
which
is
out
in
the
exterior
of
the
individual.
it's
something
which
is
his.
then
why
can't
the
state,
if
we
conclude
that
due
process
doesn't
prohibit
this,
why
can't
a
state
then
insert
a
needle
and
inject
nalline
into
any
individual
who
was
arrested
and
who
appears
to
be
either
one
under
the
influence
of
intoxicating
beverages
or
a
narcotic.
they'll
take
out
so
many
cc's
of
blood
and
stick
in
so
many
cc's
of
nalline.
i
think
it
follows
if
this
court
holds
that
it's
proper
to
withdraw
the
blood
that
is
certainly
just
as
proper
to
inject
the
nalline
if
we're
looking
at
the
welfare
of
society
and
how
we
want
to
keep
narcotic
users
off
the
street.
so,
i
feel
that
this
court
in
determining
the
issue
really
should
conclude
that
the
due
process
clause
does
prohibit
the
invasion
of
the
body
in
this
manner.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
none,
they've
stipulated
that.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
now,
the
next
point
is
the
question
of
self-incriminations
and
i
feel
that
although
this
court
and
many
other
courts
are
--
the
majority
of
this
court
have
held
in
the
past
that
self-incrimination
basically
only
applies
to
testimonial
compulsion
and
not
to
“real
evidence”
that
nevertheless
in
this
type
of
case
it
seems
analogous
to
a
situation
whereby
some
type
of
force
or
some
subtle
means,
the
law
enforcement
agency
extracts
a
confession
or
an
admission
out
of
the
defendant.
now,
this
court
has
held
that
that's
a
violation
of
due
process
yet
that
the
exact
and
sole
purpose
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
blood
in
this
case
to
be
used
against
the
defendant
and
in
obviously,
incrimination,
and
the
breithaupt
citation
in
the
duroncelay
and
california
all
talk
about
the
efficacy
of
the
blood
sample
in
proving
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
pardon?
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
your
honor,
i
submit
the
same
argument
--
argument
can
be
utilized
to
a
confession
because
we're
--
in
the
argument
your
honor
is
assuming
it's
confession,
let's
say
the
law
enforcement
officers
used
force
against
the
defendant
and
he
admits
certain
facts,
doesn't
constitute
a
confession
but
he
admits
certain
circumstantial
facts
which
in
the
web
of
the
whole
case
enables
a
conviction
or
result.
and
yet
as
far
as
that
the
defendant
is
concerned,
and
as
far
as
your
honor
might
be
concerned,
there
are
exculpatory
facts.
yet
it
would
still
be
excluded
because
it
was
a
violation
of
due
process
and
it
violates
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
that's
right.
and
the
same
thing
can
be
said,
i
think,
of
the
officer
who
breaks
down
the
door,
smashes
into
a
house
because
he
didn't
have
a
search
warrant
but
he
heard
someone
had
narcotics,
and
he
looks
through
the
house
and
lo
and
behold,
he
finds
no
narcotics.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no,
but
again
--
you
have
to
start
all
over
the
premise.
is
it
or
isn't
it
a
violation
of
due
process,
because
when
someone
breaks
down
a
door
to
go
into
someone's
house,
you
don't
know
beforehand
whether
you're
going
to
find
something
there.
the
violation
of
the
constitution
occurs
when
the
door
is
broken
down.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
the
violation
of
constitution
occurs
when
the
needle
is
inserted.
now,
that
to
me
is
the
point
where
you
have
to
make
a
decision
not
afterwards
when
you
determine
whether
or
not
something
bad
is
found
or
something
good
is
found
depending
upon
which
side
you
are.
so
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
not
at
this
point,
i
certainly
wouldn't
because
i
think
there's
a
big
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
not
the
argument
--
not
completely
extend
to
it,
no,
i'm
sure
i
could
stand
up
here
and
make
that
argument
but
i
certainly
wouldn't
be
as
convinced
of
it
as
i
am
at
this
particular
point
because
in,
one,
you
have
the
invasion
of
the
body
which
i
think
is
a
big
distinguishing
feature.
and
the
other,
you
have
--
the
forcing
of
an
individual
to
do
something
with
an
exterior
portion
of
his
body
--
standing
up
or
giving
the
fingerprints.
and
i
think
another
distinguishing
factor
is
the
fact
that
in
fingerprinting
you
have
a
tremendous
problem
in
our
country
of
identification.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
well,
i
think
the
counsel
should
be
present
in
a
police
line
up.i
didn't
feel
that
that's
a
constitutional
requirement.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no.
but
there
are
statutes,
which
authorizes
the
utilization
of
nalline
if
the
defendant
consents
to
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
there's
no
such
statute
which
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
absolutely.
the
doctor
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
doctor
and
the
officers
are
both
responsible
for
the
tort,
definitely.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
i
see
--
alright,
yes,
you're
right.
i
would
say
i
--
i
have
a
feeling
relative
to
the
fact
that
this
--
the
state
law
of
course
is
--
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
that
is
correct.
and
the
other
point
of
course
is
the
fact
that
a
search
and
seizure
made
after
a
lawful
arrest,
and
i'm
not
arguing
the
lawfulness
of
the
arrest,
search
and
seizure
must
be
reasonable.
again,
i
say
that
i
don't
see
how
a
puncturing
of
the
skin
or
an
entry
into
the
body
can
be
deemed
reasonable.
the
searching
of
the
individual's
clothes,
the
searching
of
the
immediate
area
has
been
held
to
be
reasonable.
but
the
entry
into
his
body,
i
submit,
is
not
reasonable
and
i
think
that
both
the
fifth
and
fourth
really
run
together
here
when
we
talk
about
search
and
seizure
and
about
self-incrimination,
that
they
run
together
here,
and
result
in
a
conclusion
that
it's
improper
to
make
this
type
of
entry.
and
additionally,
whether
or
not
the
court
really
feels
this
point
as
important
that
--
it's
a
point
that's
raised
so
frequently
in
california,
giving
the
instruction
to
the
jury
that
they
can
consider
the
fact
that
the
defendant
refused
to
give
breath
test
or
a
blood
test.
i
think,
if
the
court
decides
that
the
individual
has
the
constitutional
right
to
refuse,
for
example
the
blood
test,
that
then
it
is
improper
and
a
violation
of
griffin
versus
california
to
enable
the
court
to
comment
to
the
jury
on
it
and
enable
the
jury
to
draw
a
conclusion
from
that
fact.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
m.
mcgurrin
no,
i
think,
if
your
honors
ask
questions
i
--
very
well.
