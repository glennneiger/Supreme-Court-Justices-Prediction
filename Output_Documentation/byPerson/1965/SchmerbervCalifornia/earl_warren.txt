chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davenport,
may
i
ask,
if
it
would
make
any
difference
if
this
man
had
resisted
physically
and
it
had
to
be
taken
by
force
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
ask
you
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
it
would
make
any
difference
in
your
case
if
the
man
resisted
physically
and
as
well
as
resisted
mentally?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
davenport
wasn't
the
liquor
beyond
the
reach
of
them
too,
unless
they
went
into
his
veins
and
got
--
got
his
blood?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
opposed
to
the
narcotics
that
went
into
his
stomach?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
just
--
i
just
wanted
to
get
the
--
your
answer
to
the
question
as
to
whether
it
made
any
difference
to
your
case
if
the
man
said,
“no,
my
counsel
has
advised
me
not
to
--
not
to
permit
this
and
i
won't
do
it.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
--
and
they
proceed
then
to
take
it
or
whether
he
said,
“no.
now,
you
can't
do
it
and
if
you
do,
i'm
going
to
fight
it
out
with
you.”
and
he
--
and
he
become
belligerent
and
wants
to
fight
it
out
with
him,
can
they
then
force
him
to
do
it
as
they
can
the
other
way,
that's
all
i
want
to
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
it
make
any
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose,
he's
a
little
stronger
than
the
people
who
were
--
who
were
trying
to
take
it,
would
it
make
any
difference
then
if
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
he
fight
them
off
and
perhaps
beat
them
in
the
--
in
the
room
that
they're
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
would
say
that
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
fighting
in
the
state
--
on
the
part
of
the
a
man
who
is
under
arrest
would
make
the
difference
and
would
eliminate
him
on
the
necessity
of
having
one
of
those
where
a
man
who
is
perhaps
a
good
citizen,
otherwise
would
say
i'm
--
i
really
on
my
constitutional
rights,
and
the
advise
of
my
lawyer,
and
i
refuse
to
let
you
take
it.
if
that
man
--
if
that
man
is
--
has
his
blood
taken,
you
say
that's
all
right.
but
if
he
acts
like
a
hoodlum
in
there,
and
wants
to
fight
it
out
with
the
police
and
he's
able
to
prevail
to
some
extent,
then
you
say
that
that
they
couldn't
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
for
instance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
obeys
the
law,
he
isn't
in
any
--
in
any
troubles.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean,
after
he's
in
custody
that
the
--
that
the
law
has
the
right
to
give
a
belligerent
fellow
who
will
not
obey
any
--
any
rules
and
regulations,
more
benefits
than
a
man
who
is
decent
and
who
does
comply
with
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
do
you
differentiate
them
here
then
if
you
--
if
in
one
situation
they're
entitled
to
take
the
man's
blood
and
in
another
they
are
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
--
what
is
reasonable
here
if
the
man
is
in
the
hospital
bed
with
a
broken
leg,
or
supposedly
broken
leg
and
other
--
and
other
wounds
and
so
forth,
then
the
police
then
come
in
and
demand
to
take
his
blood.
and
he
objects
madly
but
hasn't
strike
to
make
any
physical
resistance,
you
would
say,
“because
of
that
fact,
it's
perfectly
alright.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davenport,
may
i
ask
you
this,
suppose
when
--
in
your
case,
after
the
doctor
had
taken
his
blood,
the
doctor
found
that
he
was
not
intoxicated,
that
he
didn't
have
enough
alcohol
in
his
blood,
and
the
police
then
concluded
that
well
he
had
some
of
the
symptoms
also
of
the
use
of
narcotics.
could
they
get
--
could
then
have
given
him
the
nalline
test
and
gone
it
into
his
veins
for
--
for
that
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
statute
or
not,
let's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
makes
no
difference
whether
there's
a
statute
or
not
because
you
have
no
statute
here
so
let's
--
let's
try
with
a
case
where
it
got
the
statute
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
say
that
they
have
the
right
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
under
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
under
the
law
of
california,
isn't
it
just
as
much
a
crime?
and
isn't
it
incorporated
in
the
same
code
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
a
man
drives
an
automobile
under
the
influence
of
narcotics?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
think
this
tantamount
to
a
search?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
are
you
searching
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
the
search
warrant
lie
for
searching
for
the
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
then
the
question
is
whether
it
would
be
practical
enough?suppose
it
was,
would
a
search
warrant
lie
for
obtaining
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
this
isn't
anything
that
can
be
used
in
further
acts
of
crime
and
aren't
search
warrants
limited
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcgurrin,
did
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
