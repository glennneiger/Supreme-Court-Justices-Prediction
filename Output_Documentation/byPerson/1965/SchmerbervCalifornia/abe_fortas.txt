justice

fortas
that
is
also
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer,
wasn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
also
that
he
said,
“i
won't
fight
you,
because
even
if
you
take
blood,
the
police
officers
agreed
but
they
had
noted
that
it
was
being
taken
on
his
objection.
justice
abe
fortas
is
this
blood
test
considered
more
reliable
than
the
breath
test
for
purposes
of
determining
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
in
any
event,
it
is
not
established
that
the
blood
test
is
substantially
more
reliable
than
breath
test
is,
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
telling
us
that
the
breath
test
is
--
in
your
experience,
adequately
reliable
or
has
been
accepted
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
by
the
courts
and
juries?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
reason
in
which
we
can
take
cognizance
why
the
police
here
insisted
on
the
blood
test
and
then
insist
on
the
breath
test?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
call
it
then
really
“forcing”
here
in
the
sense
of
political
--
of
physical
strength
because
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
agreed
that
if
they
--
it
would
be
pleaded
as
i
understand
it
as
if
they
have
forced
him.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see,
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
a
california
statute
that
specifically
authorizes
the
police
to
take
blood
sample?
justice
abe
fortas
well
this
--
yes,
but
this
is
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
--
on
that,
is
it
your
feeling
that
this
was
a
tort
committed
by
the
officer
for
which
he
has
no
immunity
or
privilege?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
it
was?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
judicially
accepted,
has
there
been
any
tort
action
brought?
justice
abe
fortas
but
all
you're
saying
is
that
the
evidence,
so
obtained,
has
been
accepted
by
the
courts
in
a
proceeding
against
a
person
whose
blood
was
taken?
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
doesn't
--
it
may
not
necessarily
follow
that
this
state
court
(inaudible),
this
is
not
a
tort.
it
may
have
held
that
it
doesn't
--
it's
not
a
tort,
which
has
in
effect
of
requiring
the
exclusion
of
the
evidence.
but
you're
telling
me
that
there
is
no
state
statute
that
authorizes
this
kind
of
procedure.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
do
you
agree
--
do
you
agree
that
if
the
--
this
man
had
physically
struggled
with
the
police
and
the
doctor,
suppose
he
had
thrown
a
punch
at
them
and
they
had
subdued
him,
and
then
had
--
holding
him
now,
four
men
were
holding
him.
and
they
took
his
blood,
and
then
that
was
offered
at
the
trial.
do
you
agree
that
that
would
have
been
excluded?
justice
abe
fortas
--
on
these,
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
would
then
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
about
the
--
what
would
you
have
to
do?
throw
the
--
some
of
the
doctors'
equipment
that
the
doctors
had?
justice
abe
fortas
well
i'm
--
i'm
asking
you
this.
justice
abe
fortas
in
terms
of
this
case,
what
does
--
you
said
that
if
there
was
brutality
in
subduing
this
man
then
--
justice
abe
fortas
then
the
blood
that
was
taken
from
him
could
not
properly
be
used,
that's
the
law
here.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
happened
here
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
themselves
on
page
88
of
the
record.
is
that
this
man
said
that
--
this
police
officers'
testimony,
that
the
petitioner
said
that
he
wouldn't
fight
those
who
are
taking
it
because
the

officers
said
that
he
would

into
the
report
the
manner

it
was
taken
that
he
--
that
he
would
indicate
in
his
report
that
the
petitioner
had
objected.
justice
abe
fortas

the
question
is
whether
it's
your
position
that
he
--
not

he
has
to
object
in
this
clear
manner,
but
that
he
in
effect
has
to
enter
into
