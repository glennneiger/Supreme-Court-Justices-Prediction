well,
a
breathalyzer
test,
i
gathered,
does
not
involve
what
you
call
invasion
of
the
body,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
matter
of
breathing
into
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
the
arguments
you
make
--
you're
making
now
would
not
--
would
not
be
an
argument
for
excluding
a
breathalyzer
test,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
given
emphasis
on
invasion
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
is
applied?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
must
be
--
that
is
the
difference
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
a
coerce
confession
is
a
coerce
confession.
and
the
only
purpose
of
it
is
to
coerce
a
confession.
here
the
purpose
is
the
ascertainment
of
truth
and
that
might
well
have
turned
out
to
completely
exculpate
this
person
from
the
charge
of
being
intoxicated,
that
the
--
and
for
individual,
have
turned
out
for
his
protection
that
they
found
that
the
blood
sample
didn't
show
any
alcohol
in
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
assume
in
this
case
that
if
the
blood
sample
have
showed
no
alcohol
at
all,
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
case,
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
prosecution.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
point
here
though
is
that
there
were
eyewitnesses
who
said
that
this
petitioner
was
behaving
and
looked
as
though
he
was
drunk,
so
he
was
intoxicated,
and
without
--
if
there
had
been
no
blood
test
at
all,
i
supposed
that
would
have
been
sufficient
evidence
to
go
to
the
trier
of
facts,
and
there
it
could
have
--
well,
then
a
finding
that
he
was
intoxicated.
but
here,
the
blood
test
showed
no
alcohol
at
all
that
would
have
been
for
the
complete
protection
of
this
man
and
that
would
have
given
a
lie
to
the
eyewitnesses
and
it
would
have
shown
--
it
would
have
shown
that
they
were
mistaken,
that
instead
of
being
intoxicated,
this
person
was
sick
or
whatever.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
extent
it
is
not
precisely
analogous
to
--
towards
confession
or
to
a
search
and
seizure.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
i
thought
that
this
procedure
had
been
completely
judicially
approved.
justice
potter
stewart
so
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
it's
not
a
tort,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart

a
breathalyzer
