that
was
true,

it
were

compelled
to
come
in

themselves,
why
shouldn't
it
be,
if
the
first

comes
out
in
the
court,
why
shouldn't
the
court
throw
the

out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose,
if
the
indictment
shows
that
--
shows
that
that's
all
they
did.
they
just
brought
a
man
there
and
get
hold
of
him
in
two
places
at
the

time
and
one
of
them
admitted,
plead
guilty,
and
the

one
be
debarred.
justice

suppose
you
--
suppose
the
government
comes
in
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
says
we
admit
that
we've
already
made
and
confess,
we
admit
that
we
can't
convict
him
because
that's
the
--
he
got
a
constitutional
privilege
which
he's
raising
here
but
we
say
because
you
had
raised
on
this
by
motion
to
dismiss
instead
by
motion
to
suppress,
you
got
to
decide
against
him.
why
shouldn't
he
--
why
shouldn't
he
get
rid
of
the
thing
if
it's
--
maybe
they
shouldn't.

that's
on
the

the

found
that

matters
you're

is
it
your
argument
that
that's
not
enough
to
show
that
they
had
already
made

that

the

of

from
punishment

he
just
have
to

that
as

forces
him
in
