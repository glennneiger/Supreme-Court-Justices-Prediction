you

but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the

policy
is
to
try
consistently
the
criminal
cases
first.
that's
the

policy.

no,
and
then
that
you
have
a
reason
before
the
party
come
up
here.

that's
your
consistent

say
you're
not

it

way

is
your

try

the
criminal

the
only
reason
i
say
is
that
i
could
gather
from
the
record
is
they
did
find
a
sizable
bank
account.
and
it's
the
only
thing
that
i
can
see.
but
the
other
point
i
was
getting
at
the
original
argument
was
that
he
was
denied
right
at
the
counsel
because
he
didn't
have
any
money.
but
the
record
shows
that
the
internal
revenue
did
not
touch
his
earnings.
and
he
has
all
of
his
earnings
whatever
he
would
do
with
them.
indeed,
the
district
court
did
rule
with
the
government
on
that
point,
that
there
was
no
showing
that
he
had
been
denied
enough
money
to
defend

could
you
give
