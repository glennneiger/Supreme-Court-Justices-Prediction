justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
tell
me
that
--
there
should
be
--
is
there
was
a
tax
court
proceeding
that‘s
on
the
jeopardy
--
challenging
jeopardy
assessments
involved
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
your
position
whether
that
ought
to
be
concluded
before
the
criminal
proceedings
to
uphold?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
they
should.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
may
there
not
be
--
may
there
not
be
a
necessity
for
barring
from
the
criminal
trial.
i
don't
know
what
that
would
be
--
testimony
or
otherwise
that
this
taxpayer
might
give
before
the
tax
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
put
it
rather
this
way.
is
he
entitled
--
the
defendant
against
the
jeopardy
assessment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
suppose
he
has
to
testify
with
something
which
may
be
incriminating
in
respect
of
the
pending
tax
prosecution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
my
question.
how
can
you
know
that
until
the
tax
proceedings
have
been
concluded,
the
tax
court
proceedings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
your
position
that
is
--
both
can
proceed
simultaneously
or
the
criminal
prosecution
can
proceed
ahead
of
the
tax
court
proceeding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
i'm
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
thinking
about
it
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
isn't
the
clearest
record
in
the
world.
i
think
you,
agree
mr.
solicitor
general?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it's
dismissed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
point
is
i
gather
that
anything
he
has
in
the
way
of
defense
based
on
self-incrimination
or
anything
else
to
the
government's
trial
of
a
money
indictment.
whatever
that
may
be
is
properly
interposed
at
the
trial
on
the
indictment
not
by
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
any
event
that
certainly
they
can't
dismiss
a
price
for
that.
