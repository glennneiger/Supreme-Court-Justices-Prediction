mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
dismissal
of
an
indictment
charging
willful
attempts
to
evade
and
defeat
personal
income
taxes
on
the
--
the
dismissal
was
on
the
ground
of
the
defendant's
right
against
compulsory
self-incrimination
had
been
violated
as
a
result
of
a
previously
made
jeopardy
assessment
against
the
same
defendant.
on
august
5,
1964,
the
appellee
was
indicted
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california.
it
was
a
six-count
indictment
charging
violations
of
willful
attempt
to
evade
payment
of
the
taxes
and
also
to
subscribing
false
corporate
returns.
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed
against
indictment
and
the
motion
dismissed
was
grounded
on
three
propositions
that
the
defendant
could
not
get
a
fair
trial,
second,
the
alleged
he
was
denied
right
to
counsel
in
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment,
and
third
that
he
had
been
compelled
to
testify
against
himself
in
violation
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments.
the
facts
are
reasonably
simple
and
not
essentially
in
dispute.
the
counsel
for
the
appellee
attended
conferences
with
the
internal
revenue
service
officials
in
november
of
1962
and
again
in
march
of
1963.
and
that
both
of
these
meetings,
internal
revenue
made
it
clear
to
the
counsel
for
appellee
that
they
were
going
to
recommend
criminal
prosecution
with
no
question
that
was
understood
on
both
sides.
and
on
april
9
of
1963,
the
jeopardy
assessment
against
appellees
known
assets
was
issued
pursuant
to
section
6861
of
the
code.
and
on
june
6
of
the
same
year,
the
statutory
notice
of
deficiencies
for
each
of
the
tax
years
involved
were
issued
with
the
usual
letter.
the
attorneys
for
the
appellee
filed
their
petitions
with
the
tax
court.
and
these
petitions
appeared
to
be
a
normal
type
and
they
provide
the
appellee's
name
and
address,
et
cetera,
the
office,
“the
deficiencies
as
claimed,”
and
then
in
each
of
these
petitions,
concluded
with
the
allegations
repeating
an
affirmative
form
of
the
specific
assertions
of
error
contained
in
the
earlier
paragraphs.
these
were
practically
identical
and
the
sample
of
one
is
set
out
on
page
5
of
our
brief
so
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
go
into
the
record.
and
it
was
the
appellee's
position
that
the
filing
of
these
petitions
amounted
to
testimony
and
incriminating
evidence
which
made
it
impossible
to
try
him
for
criminal
charges
at
anytime
involving
the
same
years
involved.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
fact
that
the
government
by
filing
its
jeopardy
assessment
required
the
defendant
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
to
file
his
petition
in
the
tax
court
and
that
in
the
petition
in
the
tax
court,
he
gave
up
some
information.
when
we
read
the
petitions
there,
the
usual
type
of
petitions,
which
says
that
the
jeopardy
assessment
is
wrong,
solely
it
says
--
it
says
it
over
and
over
again
in
their
beautiful
language,
well
that's
all
there
is
good.
and
that
i
think
i
should
mention
that
throughout
the
colloquy
with
counsel.
the
judge
consulaire
says
that
he
has
incriminated
himself
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
not
that
he
will
later,
i'm
sure
he
means
that
this
will
be
used
in
trial.
however,
the
u.s.
attorney
repeatedly
made
it
clear
that
these
jeopardy
assessments,
the
petitions
and
nothing
else
were
going
to
be
used
at
the
trial.
there
was
no
question,
if
they
weren't
going
to
be
used.
there
was
--
it
was
true
that
they
were
into
files,
this
criminal
--
the
u.s.
attorney's
office.
and
the
position
taken
by
the
court
below
is
that
the
--
this
in
and
of
itself
was
final.
we
then
applied
to
the
court's
--
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
and
on
that
motion,
the
case
was
appealed
and
certified
here.
there
are
two
points
that
we
have
involved
and
there
are
only
two.
one
is
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
case
is
properly
here
on
certification
from
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
form
of
a
direct
appeal.
and
i
meet
that
one
first
because
it's
the
court's
jurisdiction.
and
18
u.s.
code
3731
provides
for
this
direct
appeal
when
an
indictment
is
dismissed
as
a
result
of
a
motion
in
bar.
now,
first
of
all,
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
actually
what
the
statute
says,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
there's
no
question
on
the
finality
of
the
judgment.
the
judge
did
not
issue
an
order
even
though
he
invited
an
appeal.
he
started
out
inviting
one
and
ended
up
inviting
one,
he
didn't
write
an
opinion.
but
the
order
itself
says
specifically
that
the
indictment
is
dismissed.
the
bail
is
discharged
and
the
defendant
is
released.
and
the
district
judge
said
specifically
from
the
bench,
“when
the
government
said
in
motion
the
jeopardy
assessment
and
the
90-day
letter
which
compelled
him
to
come
forward
within
a
certain
time
and
filed
his
petition
in
the
tax
court,
they,
the
government,
foreclosed
themselves
from
proceeding
in
the
criminal
case
during
that
time.”
now,
while
this
phrase,
“during
that
time”
somebody
might
think
meant
temporarily.
in
fact,
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit
said
in
this
case,
“if
the
trial
court's
views
are
correct,
there
is
no
possible
way
in
which
the
defect
in
the
indictment
can
be
cured
in
this
case
or
in
any
other
indictment
that
may
be
found.
secondly,
there
is
no
question
that
this
ruling
was
made
on
the
motion
by
the
defendant
based
upon
facts
not
covered
by
the
criminal
statute
or
the
indictment.
it
was
not
in
any
person
who
brought
him
in.
and
the
appellee's
position
in
this
regard
was
summarized
in
its
assertion
which
was
in
its
motion
to
dismiss
that
by
virtue
of
the
assertion
of
taxes,
penalties
and
interest
against
the
defendant,
the
filing
of
income
tax,
liens,
and
the
seizure
of
his
assets,
defendant
had
been
compelled
to
execute
statements
of
fact
pertaining
to
his
income
tax
liabilities
from
the
years
1958
to
1960
in
pleadings
required
to
be
presented
to
the
tax
court
of
the
united
states
and
to
the
internal
revenue
service,
thereby,
compelling
this
defendant
to
testify
against
himself
in
violation
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
to
the
characters
of
the
united
states.”
that
seems
to
me
clearly
that
this
is
within
the
general
rule
on
the
question
of
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
i
would
say
further
that
it's
clearly
set
forth
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
very
case.
the
appellee
here
claims
and
indeed
the
district
court
followed
what
they
considered
to
be
the
law
of
the
ninth
circuit.
and
when
this
case
reached
the
ninth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
distinguished
both
of
the
cases
and
held
that
it
was
no
question
that
this
case
was
not
the
type
of
case
which
they
relied
upon.and
now
as
to
the
merits
themselves,
well,
i
think
first
i
have
to
--
i
just
notice
here
we
have
the
problem
that
both
sides
are
relying
on
united
states
against
mersky
which
is
the
recent
case
of
this
court.
and
i
would
say
that
this
case
is
certainly
of
course
different.
but
on
in
each
of
these
cases
--
i
mean
in
the
mersky
case,
it
appeared
that
the
previous
cases
of
hark
and
murdock
and
storrs
were
in
bar
and
that
it
was
clear
that
the
manner
in
which
the
defendant
frames
his
pleading
is
not
determinative
of
whether
or
not
it
was
actually
a
motion
in
bar.
the
critical
factor
is
the
effect
of
the
ruling.
on
the
other
hand,
the
justices
of
this
court
came
to
the
diverging
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
type
of
ruling
which
would
have
the
requisite
effect.
justices
brennan
and
justice
whitaker
expressed
the
view
that
a
judgment
which
will
end
of
course
an
escapade
of
the
defendant
was
sufficient
to
make
it
a
motion
in
bar.
mr.
justice
stewart,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
and
mr.
justice
harlan
interpreted
the
pertinent
jurisdiction
in
the
ground
of
section
3731
as
limited
to
the
old
common
law
“special
plead
in
bar.”
and
it
was
stated
that
it
must
be
a
plea
in
confession
and
avoidance
which
does
not
contest
the
facts
of
the
indictment
but
relies
on
matters
outside
the
indictment.
and
we
say
that
the
dimis
--
dismissal
of
this
indictment
by
the
district
court
satisfies
both
of
these
tests.
and
whichever
way
this
court
reads
the
mersky
opinion
as
of
this
case,
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
district
court
was
not
only
in
error
but
that
we
come
under
section
3731
and
the
case
is
properly
here.
we
say
that
because
we
believe
that
the
only
reason
for
interpretation
of
the
district
court
ruling
is
that
it
is
necessarily
had
the
effect
of
permanently
baring
prosecution
for
income
tax
violation
during
that
period
of
time
from
1958
to
1961
and
actually
escapaded
the
appellee
for
any
internal
revenue
charges
during
that
period
of
time.
and
in
view
of
the
rejection
of
the
government's
argument
below
and
of
its
suggestion
of
an
alternative
remedy
which
is
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
any
other
kind
of
remedy
other
than
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
the
court's
dismissal
in
indictment
was
after
it
had
intended
to
leave
no
means
open
to
the
government
by
which
indictment
could
be
reinstated.
and
the
cases
relied
on
by
appellees,
there
are
cases
of
suppression
of
evidence,
of
evidence
that
could
be
produced
and
could
make
future
trial
possible.
in
this
case,
the
only
way
that
this
man
under
the
decision
of
the
district
court
here,
the
only
way
the
appellee
could
be
reindicted
legally
under
this
opinion
would
be
to
turn
the
clock
back
and
not
file
the
jeopardy
assessment
which
has
already
been
filed.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
yes
sir,
the
ones
where
--
for
example,
the
ones
i
can
remember
where
a
motion
to
suppress
is
made
or
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
is
one
case
that
they
tried
and
they
held
that
didn't'
apply.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
to
the
contrary,
one
of
the
ninth
circuit
cases
if
i
remember
was
where
the
court
ordered
the
district
--
the
u.s.
attorney
to
produce
certain
documents
before
trial
and
the
claim
was
made
that
they
couldn't
find
them
or
what
have
you.
and
the
district
court
says,
“well,
the
defendant
cannot
try
this
case
without
those.”
and
the
indictment
was
dismissed
and
that
held
was
held
not
to
be
a
plea
in
bar
because
there
was
a
possibility
that
they
could
eventually
find
them.
and
if
ever
they
found
those
papers,
they
could
retry.
but
there
are
still
plenty
of
exceptions
there.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
mersky.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
for
several
reasons,
one,
it's
in
confession
and
avoidance,
and
in
two
is
bringing
in
material
outside
of
the
indictment
itself.
that's
a
classic
one
on
back
the
old
statute
plea
in
bar.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
unless
he
doesn't
contest
the
--
the
facts
as
alleged
in
the
indictment
or
anything
about
the
indictment.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
not
on
its
face.
he's
going
outside.
he's
going
outside
of
the
indictment.
he's
not
saying
that
the
statute's
unconstitutional
or
that
the
indictment
is
holding
it
on,
hold
it
on
or
what
have
you.
he
is
saying
because
of
something
that
she
did
to
me
before.
it
would
be
very
much
like
the
case
--
the
man
comes
in
and
says,
“i
was
forced
to
confess,
coerced
into
a
confession
which
the
u.s.
attorney
has
used
before
the
grand
jury
and
he
has
in
his
possession
now.
and
the
court
says,
“you'd
been
incriminated
and
therefore
dismissed
the
indictment,”
there's
never
been
such
a
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
yes
sir,
because
it
had
nothing
to
do
about
the
confession.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i'm
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
certainly.
no,
we
couldn't
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
because
this
3731
says
that
you're
not
going
to
the
court
of
appeals
if
you
can't
come
here.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
of
any
but
it
would
--
it
would
--
if
it
was
--
well
there's
no
way
you
could
change
the
time
so
it
wouldn't
be
barred.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
case
is
over.
there's
nothing
--
i
mean
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
so.
the
cases
i
run
across
and
the
cases
that
we're
citing
both
of
our
briefs
are
cases
where
there's
something
that
could
be
done
to
make
it
possible
to
validly
reindict
it.
where
you
could
--
if
you
produce
certain
records,
you
could
go
ahead
and
try.
and
well,
if
you
produce
this,
you
could
go
ahead
and
try
it.
but
i
think
that
with
the
statute
of
limitations
and
i
don't
frankly
don't
know
or
change
one
way
or
the
other
but
i
would
say
it
was
in
much
of
the
same
category.
we
have
three
cases
and
they're
on
page
14
of
our
brief,
mr.
justice
white.
if
i
may
for
a
moment
just
get
to
the
merits,
there's
nothing
in
this
record.
first
of
all,
i
think
i'd
mentioned
that
when
the
case
was
first
tried
before,
now
the
judge
not
tried
obviously
on
a
motion.
that
judge
said
that
it
was
a
horrible
thing
for
the
government
to
make
a
man
a
pauper
and
then
try
him
in
an
in
bar
tax
case
where
he
needed
not
only
a
good
lawyer
but
a
good
accountant.
and
he
thought
that
should
be
tried
out.
then
when
the
case
got
up
for
actual
hearing
on
this
motion,
it
was
tried
with
the
cross
motions
for
summary
of
--
i
mean
cross
motions
for
judgment
and
the
affidavits,
and
there
was
live
testimony.
the
live
testimony
consisted
of
agents,
different
levels
of
internal
revenue
explaining
about
jeopardy
assessments
and
what
have
you
and
how
they
operate.
it
was
made
clear
throughout
all
of
these
that
when
the
jeopardy
assessment
was
made,
they
did
know
that
they
contemplated
criminal
proceedings
and
i
don't
see
anything
wrong
with
that.
for
some
reason,
the
u.s.
attorney
trying
the
case
did
not
voluntarily
turnover
the
copies
of
the
petitions
or
the
documents
which
they
had.
and
the
only
thing
the
defendant
wanted
to
show
was
that
the
criminal
side
of
the
government
did
have
these
copies
of
these
petitions
in
their
files
and
eventually
it's
so
stipulated.
there
was
also
testimony
to
the
fact
of
the
lawyer
himself
and
i
have
--
none
of
us
would
have
any
disagreement
whether
that
the
tax
case,
this
kind,
you
need
counsel
and
you
need
counsel
fees
and
you
need
auditors
and
you
need
accountants
and
you
need
these
for
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
they
filed
a
petition
challenging
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
it
should.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
they
should
control
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
that
it
would
be
up
to
the
taxpayer.
we
have
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
surely.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
there
--
i
am
not
too
certain
that
that
can
be
used
in
the
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
what
the
position
of
the
government
would
take
or
the
court
would
take
but
i
submit
that
that
would
not
come
up
until,
one,
he
did
testify
in
the
tax
court,
two,
the
u.s.
attorney
tried
to
use
it,
and
three,
the
judge
ruled
one
way
or
the
other.
that's
the
only
time
i
could
see
we
could
get
to
that
point.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
--
first
of
all,
i
have
to
keep
emphasizing
that
it's
not
this
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
point
is
i
believe
that
if
the
point
had
been
made
that
i
am
tried
up
over
here
in
the
tax
court
on
these
petitions
and
i
can
handle
both
at
the
same
time
that
that
would
be
a
motion
that
would
have
to
be
made
to
the
court.
or
if
you
make
a
motion
on
the
tax
court
and
say,
“i
don't
want
to
testify
here
because
i'm
only
already
in
the
criminal
case.”
but
the
resolution
of
this
problem
is
not
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
that's
my
point.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
record
shows
that
that
is
the
policy
but
it
is
not
a
rigid
one.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
you
must
have
a
good
reason
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
have
--
does
the
government
have
a
reason
here
for
departing
from
a
mutual
fund.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
(voice
overlap)
it's
clear
on
one
point.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
actually
is,
and
it's
also
clear
the
reasons
for
the
dismissal,
the
reasons
for
the
dismissal
was
that
because
a
man
have
been
compelled
to
file
a
petition
in
the
tax
court,
he
had
--
the
government
had
violated
the
fifth
amendment.
and
consequently,
the
government
was
prohibited
that
from
coming
in
the
criminal
court.
that's
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
because
mr.
justice
black,
if
the
agent
of
the
federal
government
in
taking
a
blackjack
and
beating
a
confession
out
of
a
man,
that
wouldn't
be
grounds
for
dismissal
in
the
indictment.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
say
that
you
couldn't
give
your
back
to
the
maryland
case
where
the
man
didn't
have
a
lawyer
when
he
plead
guilty
then
they
tried
to
use
it
in
the
white
against
maryland.
and
they
tried
to
use
it
in
the
second
case
and
this
court
said
you
couldn't
do
it.
but
it
shouldn't
say
you
can
dismiss
the
indictment.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
or
before
the
in
--
before
the
trial,
that
he
could
file
a
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
he
could
also
under
rule
6
(e)
even
if
he
thinks
that
these
materials
were
used
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
our
position
here.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
--
my
whole
point
is
in
this.
the
only
thing
this
man
“confessed”
if
we
use
confessed
in
quotes
was
his
allegations
that
the
government
was
wrong.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
(voice
overlap)
did
we
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
that's
what
i
thought
i
was
doing.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
my
whole
point
is
that
there
--
the
government
said
over
and
over
again,
“we
do
not
intend
to
use
anything
from
the
tax
court
proceeding.”
and
if
we
do
--
i
mean
if
they
do,
they're
subject
to
a
motion
of
course.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
he
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
he
is
not
immune
from
punishment
when
the
government
extorts
a
confession
from
him.
he
is
--
the
government
is
prohibited
from
using
the
confession.
but
if
the
government
has
other
testimony
or
that
does
not
include
the
proof
--
confession
or
the
fruits
of
the
confession,
the
government
can
convict
him
literally.
obviously,
that's
my
understanding
of
the
law.
and
it's
my
understanding
that
at
that
stage,
you'll
file
a
motion
to
suppress,
you
suppress
the
confession,
and
if
the
judge
is
really
careful,
he
says
this
includes
all
the
fruits
from
this
confession
and
the
government
can
do
it.
then
the
government
decides
as
to
whether
we've
got
anything
else.
and
if
we've
got
anything
else
he
can
be
tried.
that's
my
understanding.
and
in
this
case,
it's
different
because
he
didn't
confess
anything
except
that
he
said
the
government
is
wrong
in
and
out.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
and
that
then
i
think
it's
correct.
but
i
--
i
still
say
there's
a
little
difference
in
this
one.
and
the
difference
is
that
here
that
he
know
that
these
two
going
along
together,
the
civil
and
the
criminal.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
you're
absolutely
true.
and
if
i
could
save
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
unless
you
have
questions,
we'll
waive
for
rebuttal.
i
have
three
minutes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
dismissal
of
an
indictment
charging
willful
attempts
to
evade
and
defeat
personal
income
taxes
on
the
--
the
dismissal
was
on
the
ground
of
the
defendant's
right
against
compulsory
self-incrimination
had
been
violated
as
a
result
of
a
previously
made
jeopardy
assessment
against
the
same
defendant.
on
august
5,
1964,
the
appellee
was
indicted
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california.
it
was
a
six-count
indictment
charging
violations
of
willful
attempt
to
evade
payment
of
the
taxes
and
also
to
subscribing
false
corporate
returns.
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed
against
indictment
and
the
motion
dismissed
was
grounded
on
three
propositions
that
the
defendant
could
not
get
a
fair
trial,
second,
the
alleged
he
was
denied
right
to
counsel
in
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment,
and
third
that
he
had
been
compelled
to
testify
against
himself
in
violation
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments.
the
facts
are
reasonably
simple
and
not
essentially
in
dispute.
the
counsel
for
the
appellee
attended
conferences
with
the
internal
revenue
service
officials
in
november
of
1962
and
again
in
march
of
1963.
and
that
both
of
these
meetings,
internal
revenue
made
it
clear
to
the
counsel
for
appellee
that
they
were
going
to
recommend
criminal
prosecution
with
no
question
that
was
understood
on
both
sides.
and
on
april
9
of
1963,
the
jeopardy
assessment
against
appellees
known
assets
was
issued
pursuant
to
section
6861
of
the
code.
and
on
june
6
of
the
same
year,
the
statutory
notice
of
deficiencies
for
each
of
the
tax
years
involved
were
issued
with
the
usual
letter.
the
attorneys
for
the
appellee
filed
their
petitions
with
the
tax
court.
and
these
petitions
appeared
to
be
a
normal
type
and
they
provide
the
appellee's
name
and
address,
et
cetera,
the
office,
“the
deficiencies
as
claimed,”
and
then
in
each
of
these
petitions,
concluded
with
the
allegations
repeating
an
affirmative
form
of
the
specific
assertions
of
error
contained
in
the
earlier
paragraphs.
these
were
practically
identical
and
the
sample
of
one
is
set
out
on
page
5
of
our
brief
so
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
go
into
the
record.
and
it
was
the
appellee's
position
that
the
filing
of
these
petitions
amounted
to
testimony
and
incriminating
evidence
which
made
it
impossible
to
try
him
for
criminal
charges
at
anytime
involving
the
same
years
involved.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
fact
that
the
government
by
filing
its
jeopardy
assessment
required
the
defendant
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
to
file
his
petition
in
the
tax
court
and
that
in
the
petition
in
the
tax
court,
he
gave
up
some
information.
when
we
read
the
petitions
there,
the
usual
type
of
petitions,
which
says
that
the
jeopardy
assessment
is
wrong,
solely
it
says
--
it
says
it
over
and
over
again
in
their
beautiful
language,
well
that's
all
there
is
good.
and
that
i
think
i
should
mention
that
throughout
the
colloquy
with
counsel.
the
judge
consulaire
says
that
he
has
incriminated
himself
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
not
that
he
will
later,
i'm
sure
he
means
that
this
will
be
used
in
trial.
however,
the
u.s.
attorney
repeatedly
made
it
clear
that
these
jeopardy
assessments,
the
petitions
and
nothing
else
were
going
to
be
used
at
the
trial.
there
was
no
question,
if
they
weren't
going
to
be
used.
there
was
--
it
was
true
that
they
were
into
files,
this
criminal
--
the
u.s.
attorney's
office.
and
the
position
taken
by
the
court
below
is
that
the
--
this
in
and
of
itself
was
final.
we
then
applied
to
the
court's
--
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
and
on
that
motion,
the
case
was
appealed
and
certified
here.
there
are
two
points
that
we
have
involved
and
there
are
only
two.
one
is
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
case
is
properly
here
on
certification
from
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
form
of
a
direct
appeal.
and
i
meet
that
one
first
because
it's
the
court's
jurisdiction.
and
18
u.s.
code
3731
provides
for
this
direct
appeal
when
an
indictment
is
dismissed
as
a
result
of
a
motion
in
bar.
now,
first
of
all,
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
actually
what
the
statute
says,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
there's
no
question
on
the
finality
of
the
judgment.
the
judge
did
not
issue
an
order
even
though
he
invited
an
appeal.
he
started
out
inviting
one
and
ended
up
inviting
one,
he
didn't
write
an
opinion.
but
the
order
itself
says
specifically
that
the
indictment
is
dismissed.
the
bail
is
discharged
and
the
defendant
is
released.
and
the
district
judge
said
specifically
from
the
bench,
“when
the
government
said
in
motion
the
jeopardy
assessment
and
the
90-day
letter
which
compelled
him
to
come
forward
within
a
certain
time
and
filed
his
petition
in
the
tax
court,
they,
the
government,
foreclosed
themselves
from
proceeding
in
the
criminal
case
during
that
time.”
now,
while
this
phrase,
“during
that
time”
somebody
might
think
meant
temporarily.
in
fact,
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit
said
in
this
case,
“if
the
trial
court's
views
are
correct,
there
is
no
possible
way
in
which
the
defect
in
the
indictment
can
be
cured
in
this
case
or
in
any
other
indictment
that
may
be
found.
secondly,
there
is
no
question
that
this
ruling
was
made
on
the
motion
by
the
defendant
based
upon
facts
not
covered
by
the
criminal
statute
or
the
indictment.
it
was
not
in
any
person
who
brought
him
in.
and
the
appellee's
position
in
this
regard
was
summarized
in
its
assertion
which
was
in
its
motion
to
dismiss
that
by
virtue
of
the
assertion
of
taxes,
penalties
and
interest
against
the
defendant,
the
filing
of
income
tax,
liens,
and
the
seizure
of
his
assets,
defendant
had
been
compelled
to
execute
statements
of
fact
pertaining
to
his
income
tax
liabilities
from
the
years
1958
to
1960
in
pleadings
required
to
be
presented
to
the
tax
court
of
the
united
states
and
to
the
internal
revenue
service,
thereby,
compelling
this
defendant
to
testify
against
himself
in
violation
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
to
the
characters
of
the
united
states.”
that
seems
to
me
clearly
that
this
is
within
the
general
rule
on
the
question
of
appellate
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
i
would
say
further
that
it's
clearly
set
forth
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
very
case.
the
appellee
here
claims
and
indeed
the
district
court
followed
what
they
considered
to
be
the
law
of
the
ninth
circuit.
and
when
this
case
reached
the
ninth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
distinguished
both
of
the
cases
and
held
that
it
was
no
question
that
this
case
was
not
the
type
of
case
which
they
relied
upon.and
now
as
to
the
merits
themselves,
well,
i
think
first
i
have
to
--
i
just
notice
here
we
have
the
problem
that
both
sides
are
relying
on
united
states
against
mersky
which
is
the
recent
case
of
this
court.
and
i
would
say
that
this
case
is
certainly
of
course
different.
but
on
in
each
of
these
cases
--
i
mean
in
the
mersky
case,
it
appeared
that
the
previous
cases
of
hark
and
murdock
and
storrs
were
in
bar
and
that
it
was
clear
that
the
manner
in
which
the
defendant
frames
his
pleading
is
not
determinative
of
whether
or
not
it
was
actually
a
motion
in
bar.
the
critical
factor
is
the
effect
of
the
ruling.
on
the
other
hand,
the
justices
of
this
court
came
to
the
diverging
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
type
of
ruling
which
would
have
the
requisite
effect.
justices
brennan
and
justice
whitaker
expressed
the
view
that
a
judgment
which
will
end
of
course
an
escapade
of
the
defendant
was
sufficient
to
make
it
a
motion
in
bar.
mr.
justice
stewart,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
and
mr.
justice
harlan
interpreted
the
pertinent
jurisdiction
in
the
ground
of
section
3731
as
limited
to
the
old
common
law
“special
plead
in
bar.”
and
it
was
stated
that
it
must
be
a
plea
in
confession
and
avoidance
which
does
not
contest
the
facts
of
the
indictment
but
relies
on
matters
outside
the
indictment.
and
we
say
that
the
dimis
--
dismissal
of
this
indictment
by
the
district
court
satisfies
both
of
these
tests.
and
whichever
way
this
court
reads
the
mersky
opinion
as
of
this
case,
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
district
court
was
not
only
in
error
but
that
we
come
under
section
3731
and
the
case
is
properly
here.
we
say
that
because
we
believe
that
the
only
reason
for
interpretation
of
the
district
court
ruling
is
that
it
is
necessarily
had
the
effect
of
permanently
baring
prosecution
for
income
tax
violation
during
that
period
of
time
from
1958
to
1961
and
actually
escapaded
the
appellee
for
any
internal
revenue
charges
during
that
period
of
time.
and
in
view
of
the
rejection
of
the
government's
argument
below
and
of
its
suggestion
of
an
alternative
remedy
which
is
a
motion
to
dismiss
or
any
other
kind
of
remedy
other
than
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
the
court's
dismissal
in
indictment
was
after
it
had
intended
to
leave
no
means
open
to
the
government
by
which
indictment
could
be
reinstated.
and
the
cases
relied
on
by
appellees,
there
are
cases
of
suppression
of
evidence,
of
evidence
that
could
be
produced
and
could
make
future
trial
possible.
in
this
case,
the
only
way
that
this
man
under
the
decision
of
the
district
court
here,
the
only
way
the
appellee
could
be
reindicted
legally
under
this
opinion
would
be
to
turn
the
clock
back
and
not
file
the
jeopardy
assessment
which
has
already
been
filed.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
yes
sir,
the
ones
where
--
for
example,
the
ones
i
can
remember
where
a
motion
to
suppress
is
made
or
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
is
one
case
that
they
tried
and
they
held
that
didn't'
apply.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
to
the
contrary,
one
of
the
ninth
circuit
cases
if
i
remember
was
where
the
court
ordered
the
district
--
the
u.s.
attorney
to
produce
certain
documents
before
trial
and
the
claim
was
made
that
they
couldn't
find
them
or
what
have
you.
and
the
district
court
says,
“well,
the
defendant
cannot
try
this
case
without
those.”
and
the
indictment
was
dismissed
and
that
held
was
held
not
to
be
a
plea
in
bar
because
there
was
a
possibility
that
they
could
eventually
find
them.
and
if
ever
they
found
those
papers,
they
could
retry.
but
there
are
still
plenty
of
exceptions
there.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
mersky.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
for
several
reasons,
one,
it's
in
confession
and
avoidance,
and
in
two
is
bringing
in
material
outside
of
the
indictment
itself.
that's
a
classic
one
on
back
the
old
statute
plea
in
bar.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
unless
he
doesn't
contest
the
--
the
facts
as
alleged
in
the
indictment
or
anything
about
the
indictment.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
not
on
its
face.
he's
going
outside.
he's
going
outside
of
the
indictment.
he's
not
saying
that
the
statute's
unconstitutional
or
that
the
indictment
is
holding
it
on,
hold
it
on
or
what
have
you.
he
is
saying
because
of
something
that
she
did
to
me
before.
it
would
be
very
much
like
the
case
--
the
man
comes
in
and
says,
“i
was
forced
to
confess,
coerced
into
a
confession
which
the
u.s.
attorney
has
used
before
the
grand
jury
and
he
has
in
his
possession
now.
and
the
court
says,
“you'd
been
incriminated
and
therefore
dismissed
the
indictment,”
there's
never
been
such
a
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
yes
sir,
because
it
had
nothing
to
do
about
the
confession.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i'm
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
certainly.
no,
we
couldn't
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
because
this
3731
says
that
you're
not
going
to
the
court
of
appeals
if
you
can't
come
here.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
of
any
but
it
would
--
it
would
--
if
it
was
--
well
there's
no
way
you
could
change
the
time
so
it
wouldn't
be
barred.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
case
is
over.
there's
nothing
--
i
mean
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
so.
the
cases
i
run
across
and
the
cases
that
we're
citing
both
of
our
briefs
are
cases
where
there's
something
that
could
be
done
to
make
it
possible
to
validly
reindict
it.
where
you
could
--
if
you
produce
certain
records,
you
could
go
ahead
and
try.
and
well,
if
you
produce
this,
you
could
go
ahead
and
try
it.
but
i
think
that
with
the
statute
of
limitations
and
i
don't
frankly
don't
know
or
change
one
way
or
the
other
but
i
would
say
it
was
in
much
of
the
same
category.
we
have
three
cases
and
they're
on
page
14
of
our
brief,
mr.
justice
white.
if
i
may
for
a
moment
just
get
to
the
merits,
there's
nothing
in
this
record.
first
of
all,
i
think
i'd
mentioned
that
when
the
case
was
first
tried
before,
now
the
judge
not
tried
obviously
on
a
motion.
that
judge
said
that
it
was
a
horrible
thing
for
the
government
to
make
a
man
a
pauper
and
then
try
him
in
an
in
bar
tax
case
where
he
needed
not
only
a
good
lawyer
but
a
good
accountant.
and
he
thought
that
should
be
tried
out.
then
when
the
case
got
up
for
actual
hearing
on
this
motion,
it
was
tried
with
the
cross
motions
for
summary
of
--
i
mean
cross
motions
for
judgment
and
the
affidavits,
and
there
was
live
testimony.
the
live
testimony
consisted
of
agents,
different
levels
of
internal
revenue
explaining
about
jeopardy
assessments
and
what
have
you
and
how
they
operate.
it
was
made
clear
throughout
all
of
these
that
when
the
jeopardy
assessment
was
made,
they
did
know
that
they
contemplated
criminal
proceedings
and
i
don't
see
anything
wrong
with
that.
for
some
reason,
the
u.s.
attorney
trying
the
case
did
not
voluntarily
turnover
the
copies
of
the
petitions
or
the
documents
which
they
had.
and
the
only
thing
the
defendant
wanted
to
show
was
that
the
criminal
side
of
the
government
did
have
these
copies
of
these
petitions
in
their
files
and
eventually
it's
so
stipulated.
there
was
also
testimony
to
the
fact
of
the
lawyer
himself
and
i
have
--
none
of
us
would
have
any
disagreement
whether
that
the
tax
case,
this
kind,
you
need
counsel
and
you
need
counsel
fees
and
you
need
auditors
and
you
need
accountants
and
you
need
these
for
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
they
filed
a
petition
challenging
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
it
should.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
they
should
control
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
that
it
would
be
up
to
the
taxpayer.
we
have
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
surely.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
there
--
i
am
not
too
certain
that
that
can
be
used
in
the
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
what
the
position
of
the
government
would
take
or
the
court
would
take
but
i
submit
that
that
would
not
come
up
until,
one,
he
did
testify
in
the
tax
court,
two,
the
u.s.
attorney
tried
to
use
it,
and
three,
the
judge
ruled
one
way
or
the
other.
that's
the
only
time
i
could
see
we
could
get
to
that
point.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
--
first
of
all,
i
have
to
keep
emphasizing
that
it's
not
this
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
point
is
i
believe
that
if
the
point
had
been
made
that
i
am
tried
up
over
here
in
the
tax
court
on
these
petitions
and
i
can
handle
both
at
the
same
time
that
that
would
be
a
motion
that
would
have
to
be
made
to
the
court.
or
if
you
make
a
motion
on
the
tax
court
and
say,
“i
don't
want
to
testify
here
because
i'm
only
already
in
the
criminal
case.”
but
the
resolution
of
this
problem
is
not
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
that's
my
point.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
record
shows
that
that
is
the
policy
but
it
is
not
a
rigid
one.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
you
must
have
a
good
reason
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
have
--
does
the
government
have
a
reason
here
for
departing
from
a
mutual
fund.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
(voice
overlap)
it's
clear
on
one
point.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
actually
is,
and
it's
also
clear
the
reasons
for
the
dismissal,
the
reasons
for
the
dismissal
was
that
because
a
man
have
been
compelled
to
file
a
petition
in
the
tax
court,
he
had
--
the
government
had
violated
the
fifth
amendment.
and
consequently,
the
government
was
prohibited
that
from
coming
in
the
criminal
court.
that's
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
because
mr.
justice
black,
if
the
agent
of
the
federal
government
in
taking
a
blackjack
and
beating
a
confession
out
of
a
man,
that
wouldn't
be
grounds
for
dismissal
in
the
indictment.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
say
that
you
couldn't
give
your
back
to
the
maryland
case
where
the
man
didn't
have
a
lawyer
when
he
plead
guilty
then
they
tried
to
use
it
in
the
white
against
maryland.
and
they
tried
to
use
it
in
the
second
case
and
this
court
said
you
couldn't
do
it.
but
it
shouldn't
say
you
can
dismiss
the
indictment.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
or
before
the
in
--
before
the
trial,
that
he
could
file
a
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
he
could
also
under
rule
6
(e)
even
if
he
thinks
that
these
materials
were
used
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
our
position
here.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
--
my
whole
point
is
in
this.
the
only
thing
this
man
“confessed”
if
we
use
confessed
in
quotes
was
his
allegations
that
the
government
was
wrong.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
(voice
overlap)
did
we
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
that's
what
i
thought
i
was
doing.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
my
whole
point
is
that
there
--
the
government
said
over
and
over
again,
“we
do
not
intend
to
use
anything
from
the
tax
court
proceeding.”
and
if
we
do
--
i
mean
if
they
do,
they're
subject
to
a
motion
of
course.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
he
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
he
is
not
immune
from
punishment
when
the
government
extorts
a
confession
from
him.
he
is
--
the
government
is
prohibited
from
using
the
confession.
but
if
the
government
has
other
testimony
or
that
does
not
include
the
proof
--
confession
or
the
fruits
of
the
confession,
the
government
can
convict
him
literally.
obviously,
that's
my
understanding
of
the
law.
and
it's
my
understanding
that
at
that
stage,
you'll
file
a
motion
to
suppress,
you
suppress
the
confession,
and
if
the
judge
is
really
careful,
he
says
this
includes
all
the
fruits
from
this
confession
and
the
government
can
do
it.
then
the
government
decides
as
to
whether
we've
got
anything
else.
and
if
we've
got
anything
else
he
can
be
tried.
that's
my
understanding.
and
in
this
case,
it's
different
because
he
didn't
confess
anything
except
that
he
said
the
government
is
wrong
in
and
out.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
and
that
then
i
think
it's
correct.
but
i
--
i
still
say
there's
a
little
difference
in
this
one.
and
the
difference
is
that
here
that
he
know
that
these
two
going
along
together,
the
civil
and
the
criminal.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
you're
absolutely
true.
and
if
i
could
save
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
unless
you
have
questions,
we'll
waive
for
rebuttal.
i
have
three
minutes.
