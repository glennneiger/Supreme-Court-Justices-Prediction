said

dismissing
that

just
having
to
testify
before
the
tax

and
therefore
you
couldn't
make
him
--
you
couldn't
use
that
against
him
in
the
criminal
case
because
you've
been
forced
to
testify
there?

just
omits

that
doesn't

you
have
to
dismiss
the

that
you're
confusing,
it
seems
to
me,

from
suppression
of
a
confession.
