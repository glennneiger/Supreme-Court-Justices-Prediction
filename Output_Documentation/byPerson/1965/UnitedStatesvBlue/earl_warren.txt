chief

warren
united
states
versus
blue,
number
531
on
the
docket.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
wasn't
the
rule,
i
suppose,
that
every
time
we
reverse
the
case
here
because
of
the
coerced
confession,
there'd
be
no
sense
in
saying
i'm
back
for
a
new
trial
because
they
just
have
to
dismiss
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
wasn't
disagreeing
with
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
fact
that
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
with
what
you're
thinking
but
i'm
applying
up
to
our
practice
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
mr.
mortenson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
interrupt
just
for
a
moment;
i
thought
the
solicitor
general
said
that
the
court
had
found
that
he
was
not
deprived
of
his
right,
to
his
ability
to
have
counsel
and
so
forth
by
reason
of
the
--
of
anything
it
had
done
on
a
--
under
that
jeopardy
assessment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
it
has
no
application
here,
has
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
the
material
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
may
i
ask
just
how
does
that
affect
our
case
here,
what
you've
just
been
saying?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
that
but
you
seem
to
stress
the
fact
that
the
jeopardy
assessment
was
a
$100,000
or
more
and
that
the
indictment
only
charged
$40,000
or
more.
now,
if
the
jeopardy
assessment
had
been
for
$40,000
as
the
indictment
fixed
the
amount,
wouldn't
he
then
have,
under
your
theory,
have
been
called
upon
to
violate
and
called
upon
to
--
called
upon
to
testify
as
to
that
and
therefore
the
--
in
the
same
shape?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
what
--
what
is
the
difference
between
these
variations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
may
be
but
another
day
is
another
day,
how
does
it
affect
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
has
he
been
putting
that
position
yet?
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
he
done
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
did
he
do
more
than
just
to
simply
deny
that
he
owed
that
money?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
anything
more
than
that?
did
he
make
any
admissions
in
there
that
would
hurt
him
in
the
criminal
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
take
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
he
never
had
--
he's
never
been
compelled
yet
to
do
that
at
the
time
that
the
indictment
was
dismissed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
admit
anything
in
regard
to
that?
didn't
he
just
deny
that
he
owed
the
money?
isn't
that
all
he
did
in
that
answer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
me
--
let
me
put
this
question
to
you.
suppose
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
in
this
case
had
been
denied,
and
suppose
you
then
had
a
motion
to
suppress
the
certain
evidence.
and
the
court
found
that
certain
evidence
should
be
suppressed
for
the
reason
that
you
have
just
given,
that
the
jeopardy
procedure
conflicts
with
the
--
his
rights
on
a
--
on
a
trial.
would
the
judge
have
the
right
then
to
dismiss
the
indictment
or
would
be
--
he'd
be
limited
in
his
--
in
his
response
to
your
motion
to
--
to
suppress
the
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
why
shouldn't
we
do
that
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mortenson,
suppose
the
government
sued
a
man
for
taxes
that
he
didn't
pay
for
illegally
operating
a
skill,
would
it
then
be
deprive
to
be
--
of
the
right
to
prosecute
him
until
that
case
was
decided?
chief
justice
earl
warren
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
we'll

then.
