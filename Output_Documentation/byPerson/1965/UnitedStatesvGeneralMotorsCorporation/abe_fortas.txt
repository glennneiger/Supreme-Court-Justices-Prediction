justice
abe
fortas
did
the
discount
house
bear
any
of
the
credit
risk?
justice
abe
fortas
would
the
chevrolet
dealer
receive
the
full
amount
of
the
sales
price
of
the
car
from
the
discount
house
at
the
time
that
the
chevrolet
dealer
turned
over
the
car?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
just
before
you
leave
that,
then
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you,
i
thought
you
said
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart
or
maybe
it
was
mr.
justice
white
that
at
no
time
did
the
discount
house
owned
the
car.
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
the
discount
house
had
even
a
security
title?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
all
these
are
set
out
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
friedman,
excuse
me,
just
one
other
observation.
i
missed
the
--
i
don't
remember
seeing
in
your
--
in
the
government's
brief
a
reference
to
this
question
on
the
precise,
exact
mechanics
of
these
transactions
and
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
at
the
moment,
i
think
that
the
question
of
the
title
and
the
legal
characterization,
the
parties
to
the
transaction
at
various
stages
in
it,
is
of
some
importance
to
me.
justice
abe
fortas
summary
of
it
but
that's
not
what
i'm
asking
about.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
conceding
mr.
friedman
that
general
motors
was
not
a
party
to
the
vertical
conspiracy
that
you
just
described,
even
though
of
course
i
know
it
was
not
in
the
vertical
line.
but
are
you
saying
that
the
case
against
general
motors
rests
exclusively
on
the
franchise
agreement?
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
but
this
is
intensely
interesting
to
me
as
i
see
the
problem
now.
are
you
conceding
that
these
discount
house
operations
should
be
looked
at
as
if
they
were
within
the
branch
provisions
of
the
franchise
agreements,
but
contending
that
the
legal
implications
are
different?
in
other
words,
are
you
conceding
that
these
discount
house
operations
or
referral
services
are
to
be
attributed
to
the
dealer
and
that
they
are
to
be
considered
as
if
they
were
the
dealer's
operation
and
in
fact
part
of
his
establishment?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
sole
basis
of
your
attack?
that
is
to
say,
are
you
suggesting
to
us
that
we
are
to
consider
this
case
as
if
the
--
or
on
the
basis
of
the
proposition
that
these
discount
house
operations
are
within
the
scope
of
the
branch
provisions
of
the
franchise
agreements?
now,
that's
my
question.
i
want
to
hasten
to
say
that
i
understand
that
you're
saying
that
even
so
there
may
be
different
legal
consequences.
but
i'd
like
first
to
find
out
from
you
if
it's
not
accessibly
awkward
or
troublesome
whether
the
government
is
conceding
that
these
discount
house
operations
are
to
be
considered
as
branches
of
the
retail
dealer's
operation?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
not
quite
the
same
--
it's
not
quite
responsive.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question
and
i'll
leave
you
alone
and
i'm
sorry.
i
want
to
ask
you
what
happens
with
respect
to
the
trade-ins.
there
is
a
finding
or
a
completion
of
the
court
that
to
me
is
ambiguous
with
respect
to
trade-in
and
i
haven't
had
chance
to
check
it.
does
the
determination
of
how
much
is
given
in
trade-in
for
the
used
cars
made
by
the
discount
houses
here?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there's
a
--
and
then
the
referral
it's
the
other
way.
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
discount
house
then
acquire
the
used
car
just
the
way
the
dealer
would?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
discount
house
acquires
the
used
car
that's
traded
in
for
its
own
account,
is
that
correct?
not
for
the
account
of
the
dealer
with
whom
it's
working
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
take
it
that
the
government
is
here
presenting
a
case
without
any
differentiation
between
the
referral
and
the
discount
houses,
number
one?
justice
abe
fortas
and
two,
that
you're
willing
to
submit
the
case
to
us
on
the
proposition
that
where
we
would
--
could
appropriately
consider
the
discount
houses
as
if
they
were
just
a
branch
of
the
retail
dealer?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
trying
to
get
your
theory
on
this.
justice
abe
fortas
still
mr.
friedman
you
trouble
me,
because
when
you
made
that
last
statement,
you
say
sell
to
a
discount
house.
and
what
i'm
trying
to
get
straight
is
whether
the
government
is
presenting
this
case
as
if
the
met
legal
situation
is
that
of
a
sale
from
a
retail
dealer
to
the
discount
house,
or
whether
the
discount
house
is
in
effect
an
agency
for
the
retail
dealer
and
those
are
just
parts,
not
the
totality
of
the
inquiry
that
one
must
make,
i
think,
to
determine
whether
we
consider
this
as
a
branch
perhaps
as
a
franchise
agreement.
justice
abe
fortas
well
on
the
basis
--
excuse
me
mr.
mitchell.
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
basis
of
what
you
say
as
a
typical
discount
house
transaction,
would
it
be
within
reason
in
legal
logic,
in
your
opinion,
to
regard
the
discount
house
as
either
an
independent
contractor
here
or
as
agent
for
the
buyer?
justice
abe
fortas
but
he's
doing
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
just
trying
to
get
this
straighten
out.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
he
obtains
a
power
of
attorney
from
the
buyer
and
he
proceeds
to
obtain
the
car
pursuant
to
that
power
of
attorney
and
he
also
proceeds
to
make
the
arrangement
at
the
finance
company.
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
i
suppose
--
well,
we
all
know
how
vague
these
concepts
are
and
how
difficult
it
is
to
make
legal
characterizations
in
this
field.
i
suppose
it
would
be
possible
to
look
on
the
discount
house
as
either
an
independent
--
as
an
independent
contractor
or
certainly
as
an
agent
for
both.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
mitchell,
forgive
me
but
to
me,
your
response
to
mr.
justice
white's
last
question
would
be
quite
important
as
i
see
the
case
now
and
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
understand
your
viewpoint.
you
said
earlier
that
you
did
or
some
of
these
dealers
did
furnish
cars
to
avis,
is
that
true?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
let
us
assume
--
justice
abe
fortas
thats
right,
now
let
us
assume,
if
you
will,
as
to
take
mr.
justice
white's
illustration
that
avis
decides
to
go
into
the
business
of
reselling
some
of
those
cars.
in
other
words,
it
buys
cars
from
a
dealer
there
and
as
some
of
those
cars
had
re-serviced.
now,
is
it
your
position
that
you
would
have
(a)
power
under
your
franchise
agreement,
and
(b)
assuming
that
you
had
the
power
under
your
franchise
agreement
that
you
could
lawfully
exercise
that
power
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
prevent
dealers
from
selling
cars
to
avis
for
resale?
i've
tried
to
make
this
very
specific
so
i
can
get
your
answer
to
it.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now
tell
me
what,
in
your
view,
are
the
differences
between
that
hypothetical
situation
and
the
one
with
which
we're
here
confronted.
now,
avis
is
an
established
company
and
has
places
of
business
and
under
my
question
to
you
from
those
places
of
business
they
were
obtaining
cars
from
your
dealers
and
reselling
them.
now,
it
would
help
me
if
you
would
tell
me
in
what
material
respects
that
illustration
differs
from
the
case
that
is
before
us.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
you
said
it
several
times.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
think
that
discount
houses
could
not
use
that
double
title
of
transfer
device
here
because
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
represent
that
the
car
was
a
new
car,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
what
you're
relying
on?
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
really
not
interested
in
the
commercial
aspects
of
this,
i'm
sure
you
know.
justice
abe
fortas
what
--
that
was
a
letter
telling
them
not
to
deal
with
discount
houses?
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
sent
it
to
every
dealer.
justice
abe
fortas
did
general
motors
bring
suit
against
any
of
these
--
any
of
its
dealers
for
violation
of
franchise
agreement
in
this
respect?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sure
the
feeling
is
mutual.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
finding
--
judge
hansen,
is
there
a
finding
that
the
effect
of
the
association
participated
in
the
inspection
or
policing
or
whatever
it
may
be
called?
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
was
that
legislation?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
doesn't
make
this
whole
question
practically
academic?
was
that
bill
passed
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
did
the
associations
also
advise
general
motors
of
the
results
of
the
surveys
made
by
their
hired
man?
