mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
one
of
the
most
remarkable
developments
in
retail
merchandising
since
the
end
of
world
war
ii
has
been
the
development
of
the
discount
house.
today,
throughout
the
country,
there
exist
a
larger
number
of
very
good
and
large
establishments
which
are
devoted
to
selling
consumer
goods
primarily
as
an
--
with
an
emphasis
on
discount
houses.
the
tremendous
variety
of
consumer
goods
almost
every
type
of
thing
we
can
think
of
with
one
striking
exception
and
that
has
been
new
automobiles.
what
this
case
is
about
is
the
legality
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
of
certain
actions
taken
by
general
motors
and
its
automobile
dealers
in
order
to
stop
the
sale
of
new
chevrolet
automobiles
in
the
los
angeles
area
through
discount
houses
in
that
area.
the
government's
complaint
in
this
case
filed
in
the
southern
district
of
california
named
as
the
defendants
general
motors
and
three,
the
associations
of
automobile
dealers
in
the
los
angeles
area.
the
individual
dealers
in
that
area
were
named
as
co-conspirators
but
not
as
defendants.
the
charge
made
by
the
government
was
that
they
had
combined
and
conspired
to
induce
and
persuade
chevrolet
dealers
in
that
area
to
refrain
from
selling
chevrolets
through
discount
houses.
after
a
trial,
the
district
court
held
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
the
court
ruled
there
had
not
been
any
combination
or
conspiracy
and
that
everything
done
by
general
motors
was
a
valid
attempt
to
enforce
a
provision
of
its
franchise
agreement
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
we
are
asking
relief
primarily
against
general
motors,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
are,
yes
mr.
justice.
the
--
there's
true
in
so
many
of
these
antitrust
cases,
the
basic
facts
are
really
not
in
dispute.
there's
no
question
as
to
what
the
court
has
did.
the
real
issue
is
to
what
inferences
ought
to
be
gone
from
those
facts
and
what
can
--
legal
conclusions
prior.
the
way
in
which
new
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
are
mr.
justice
in
few
instances.
there
are
few
facts
which
on
one
of
our
theories
we
would
have
to
overturn
and
i
will
come
to
those
a
little
later
on.
we're
not
making
a
general
attack
on
the
funds.
we
are
of
course
challenging
the
legal
conclusions
of
the
district
court.
the
way
in
which
these
new
car
discount
sales
took
place
is
as
follows,
there
were
these
large
discount
department
stores
in
the
los
angeles
area
and
within
these
discount
department
stores,
independent
people
operated
new
car
departments.
these
departments
generally
occupied
a
small
portion
of
the
premises.
they
had
available
new
car
literature.
they
had
in
some
instances
new
car
models
on
display.
at
no
point
at
any
time
was
there
any
ads
in
these
sections
for
particular
dealers.
there
was
no
advertisement
of
adams
chevrolet
or
brown
ford.
that
was
not
present.
the
discount
department
handled
all
makes
and
models
of
automobiles,
not
just
chevrolet,
not
just
general
motors.
now,
there
were
two
different
techniques
by
which
these
sales
make.
in
the
first
type
of
technique
which
might
be
called
the
discount
house
sale
itself,
the
costumer
came
in
and
told
what
particular
car
he
wanted
and
the
discount
house
then
quoted
a
price
to
him.
they
did
not
at
that
point
tell
him
to
which
dealer
the
car
would
be
obtained.
they
quoted
a
price
when
they
finally
ended
into
a
contract,
at
that
point
for
the
first
time
the
costumer
said
your
car
will
be
supplied
for
example
by
brutus
chevrolet,
one
of
the
dealers
operating
through
a
discount
house.
the
car
ordinarily
was
delivered
to
the
costumer
at
the
discount
house.
the
discount
house
made
the
car
available
--
i'm
sorry,
the
discount
house
got
the
car
from
the
dealer
with
whom
it
had
this
arrangement
and
in
turn,
turned
it
over
to
the
costumer.
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
discount
house
never
owned
the
car.
title
passed
directly
from
the
dealer
to
the
costumer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
suppose
so,
there
was
an
effect
comparable
to
a
salesman,
we
think
basically.
in
that
sense,
it
was
an
agent
of
the
dealer.
it
was
in
effect
selling
cars
in
behalf
of
dealers
in
way
of
which
costumers
would
obtain
for
the
dealer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
effect
that's
what
it
was.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
sales
agent,
yes.
a
sale
that
someone
--
i
hesitate
to
use
the
words
sales
agent
for
they
have
a
very
special
connotation,
at
least
does
seem
to
general
motors,
but
this
is
in
effect
what
it
was.
there
were
as
a
place,
the
discount
house
was
a
place
in
which
the
costumers
were
obtained
for
certain
dealers
for
the
sale
of
new
chevrolet.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
yes
it
may
have.
again,
it
depends.
the
transactions
varied.
in
some
instances,
i
suppose
the
costumer
paid
cash.
in
other
instances,
the
discount
house
undertook
to
finance
the
car.
and
in
some
instances,
indeed
discount
houses
would
take
the
used
car
in
trade.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
ordinarily,
that
was
the
normal
situation.
there
are
a
couple
of
dealers
in
this
case
that
had
some
trouble
ultimately
getting
paid,
but
that
was
the
normal
practice.
the
discount
house
would
pay
for
the
car
at
the
time
the
discount
house
received
it
from
the
dealer,
and
the
arrangement
was
ordinarily
that
the
dealer
would
sell
to
the
discount
house
at
a
certain
stipulated
mark-up
over
the
dealer's
invoice.
now,
there
is
mr.
justice
another
type
of
arrangement,
not
just
this
one.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
the
title
passed
from
the
dealer
to
the
costumer,
but
the
mechanics
of
paying
it
where
that
the
costumer
paid
the
discount
house
which
in
turns
paid
the
dealer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
believe
so.
they
might
have
in
turn
made
some
further
arrangement
with
the
costumer,
as
far
as
financing
the
car
was
concerned.
but
in
terms
of
the
relationships
between
the
dealer
and
the
discount
house
and
the
costumer,
as
far
as
the
dealer
was
concerned,
the
dealer
turned
title
over
to
the
costumer
and
in
turn
received
the
payment
from
the
discount
house.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
there
is
testimony
explaining
that.
and
it's
further
may
--
a
little
more
confusing
perhaps
by
the
fact
there
was
another
method
by
which
they
did
business
which
is
perhaps
a
majority
of
the
situation,
and
that
was
the
so-called
referral
situation
in
which
what
happened
was
if
a
costumer
came
into
the
discount
house
and
said
he
wanted
to
buy
a
particular
model
of
a
car,
they
said,
“fine!
we
will
refer
you
to
a
dealer
who
will
sell
it
to
you.”
in
that
situation,
the
costumer
was
not
quoted
a
price
at
all,
he
was
just
referred
to
a
particular
dealer,
and
then
he
went
to
the
dealer
and
directly
negotiated
a
sale
with
the
dealer
in
the
same
way
that
any
other
costumer
would.
and
the
compensation
in
that
arrangement
was
the
dealer
paid
--
i'm
sorry,
the
dealer
--
it's
correct,
the
dealer
paid
to
the
discount
house
a
flat
fee
for
each
car
that
was
sold
under
a
referral.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
was
a
mark-up
really.
in
other
words,
the
dealer
said
to
the
discount
house
for
example,
“we'll
sell
you
the
car
for
$75
over
our
invoice.”
so
that
the
discount
house's
cost
was
the
dealer's
cost,
invoice
cost,
plus
$75
and
then
the
discount
house
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
in
effect
mr.
justice,
it
operated
only
a
commission
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
in
those
terms,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
but
the
amount
of
the
difference
there,
the
one
difference
is
in
the
first
case,
the
discount
house
had
within
its
control
at
what
level
to
fix
the
commission
because
it
had
a
discretion
in
quoting
the
price.
whereas
in
the
second
case,
it
had
a
direct
arrangement
with
the
dealer
how
much
it
was
going
to
get
on
each
particular
sale.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
this
is
a
matter
of
some
dispute.
we
think
that
generally
speaking,
he
came
out
reasonably
well
and
we
think
that
is
proven
by
the
evidence,
i
will
to
in
a
minute,
about
the
many
complaints
from
the
discount
houses,
from
the
dealers
in
certain
areas
about
the
discount
house
itself.
now
for
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice,
may
i
refer
you
to
pages
4
and
5
of
the
government's
brief
in
which
we
summarize
the
basic
distinction
that
i'm
explaining,
and
there
is
some
testimony
in
the
record
which
describes
in
greater
detail
the
way
in
which
these
transactions
took
place.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
think
mr.
justice
that
there
is
this
significance
and
now
from
our
point
of
view
that
general
motors
apparently
concedes
that
it
would
be
permissible
for
the
dealer
to
sell
to
a
discount
house.
in
other
words,
they
apparently
concede
that
if
the
transaction
took
the
form
of
the
dealer
selling
to
the
discount
house
and
the
discount
house
then
immediately
turning
it
over
to
the
costumer,
they
think
they
concede
that
would
be
permissible.
they
say
that
for
a
fact
that
it
sold
through
the
discount
house.
the
title
does
not
directly
pass
to
the
consumer.
they
think
that
makes
the
difference.
and
we
--
as
i
shall
develop
later
in
my
argument,
we
think
that
in
terms
of
the
basic
defense
that's
offered
of
the
need
to
preserve
the
franchise
system
in
terms
of
the
impact
on
competition,
there's
no
distinction.
so
this
is
why
we
don't
draw
any
distinction.
i
was
just
trying
to
explain
the
mechanics.
and
for
the
sake
of
simplicity
in
my
argument,
i'm
going
to
refer
to
both
of
these
types
of
transaction
as
discount
houses
rather
than
separating
them
out,
because
we
think
in
terms
of
the
basic
issues
in
the
case
as
this,
we
don't
draw
any
distinction.
now,
the
sales
of
automobiles
through
discount
houses
began
apparently
around
1957,
but
they
didn't
attain
any
substantial
proportions
until
the
middle
of
1960.
in
that
year,
2%
of
all
the
chevrolets
sold
in
los
angeles,
that
is
approximately
2000
out
of
a
total
of
100,000
were
sold
through
these
discount
houses.
and
one
significant
area
which
we
have
focused
on
because
that's
most
of
the
evidence
relates
to
is
an
area
called
orange
county
which
was
a
substantial
difference
from
downtown
metropolitan
los
angeles.
and
the
dealers
who
were
selling
in
orange
county
were
not
the
dealers
located
in
orange
county
but
dealers
located
a
substantial
distance
away,
sometimes
as
much
as
15
or
20
miles.
now,
in
the
summer
of
1960,
a
number
of
dealers
who
were
members
of
one
of
the
three
defendant
associations,
the
so-called
losor
association,
became
quite
concerned
about
this
discount
selling.
and
in
a
meeting
of
the
association
in
june,
they
appointed
a
committee
to
call
upon
the
los
angeles
regional
zone
manager,
a
mr.
o'connor
who
was
in
charge
with
chevrolet
operations
in
that
area
in
an
attempt
to
induce
general
motors
as
the
district
court
found
in
finding
34
to
take
some
action
respecting
such
selling.
they
met
with
mr.
o'connor.
mr.
o'connor
agreed
to
do
what
he
could.
he
said
he
would
talk
to
the
dealers
about
it
but
he
pointed
out
to
them
that
his
authority
was
rather
limited,
because
as
of
that
time,
general
motors
had
not
made
any
definitive
announcement
of
its
policy
on
discount
selling
and
that
every
dealer
was
free
to
sell
to
whom
he
pleased.
mr.
o'connor
met
with
these
dealers
and
the
dealers
did
not
indicate
that
they
would
stop.
so
the
losor
dealers
decided
that
some
stronger
measures
were
important,
and
at
a
membership
meeting
in
november
of
1960
and
the
district
court
found
they
agreed
at
that
meeting
to
write
letters
or
telegrams
to
the
top
management
at
general
motors
urging
general
motors
to
do
something
about
this
problem.
the
result
of
this
was
a
flood
of
letters
and
telegrams
to
detroit,
total
about
200
of
them
was
sent
by
various
salesmen
primarily
and
also
some
of
the
dealers
in
the
area.
now,
i
think
it's
significant
because
the
district
court
made
a
finding
that
in
some
instances,
some
of
the
complainants
referred
to
price.
to
point
out
that
this
printed
record
before
the
court
contains
36
documents
in
which
specific
complaint
is
made
by
the
sellers
and
the
dealers
about
the
price
cutting
of
the
discount
houses.
and
several
of
these
salesmen
and
dealers
specifically
complained
about
losing
particular
sale
of
cars
to
the
discounting
dealers.
now,
i'd
like
to
just
read
to
the
court
a
few
of
some
of
these
comments
because
i
think
they,
better
than
anything
else,
give
the
flavor
of
what
these
complaining
dealers
in
orange
county
were
concerned
about,
some
of
these
typical
comments.
for
example,
“our
chevrolets
are
being
discounted
beyond
reason.
cars
are
being
sold
at
tremendous
discounts
and
to
compete,
we
have
to
give
all
the
gross
profit
away.
discount
houses
are
selling
at
fabulous
discount
prices,
at
huge
discounts
just
over
cost,
and
these
discount
houses
are
undercutting
your
legitimate
dealers.”
another
salesman
said,
“it
is
impossible
to
compete
with
these
people
on
a
price
basis.”
another
one
said,
“their
only
advantage
is
cheap
price.”
and
one
dealer
made
the
following
statement
in
a
letter
to
general
motors,
a
dealer
named
hopper,
he
said
and
this
is
at
page
635
of
the
record,
“these
leeches
are
selling
new
chevrolets
2
to
$300
less
than
i
can
afford
to
deliver
one.
they
informed
the
people
to
shop
the
agencies
and
get
the
best
price
as
you
can
then
come
back
and
save
hundreds.
what
hurts
is
that
it
is
true.”
now
when
general
motors
received
these
communications
it
took
a
number
of
steps.
the
first
step
it
took
was
to
call
upon
the
los
angeles
zone
headquarters
for
a
complete
report
on
the
situation.
including
a
statement
as
explained
by
mr.
o'connor,
“what
action
we
in
the
zone
we're
taking
to
curb
such
sales.”
and
mr.
o'connor
responded
that
they
had
discussed
the
matter
with
all
of
the
dealers
in
an
attempt
to
get
them
to
stop
the
practice
and
that
indeed
the
dealer
associations
have
formed
a
committee
to
call
on
the
dealers
to
try
to
get
them
to
do
that.
and
then
he
continued,
and
this
is
at
651
of
the
record,
“the
people
of
the
los
angeles
zone
believed
that
many
of
the
dealers
will
cease
this
type
of
business
if
they
had
any
assurance
that
the
account
would
not
be
picked
up
by
some
other
dealer
immediately
upon
relinquishment.”
in
other
words,
what
the
dealers
seem
to
be
concerned
about
was
that
if
some
of
them
gave
up
selling
these
cars
through
discount
houses,
other
dealers
who
haven't
been
doing
would
pick
up
the
same
business.
when
general
motors
received
this
report,
it
conducted
its
own
investigation,
conducted
extensive
study
of
the
matter
and
then
formulated
a
company
policy
and
sent
out
a
letter
to
every
general
motors
dealer
in
the
united
states.
the
president
of
general
motors
testified
in
this
case
that
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the
complaints
from
the
dealers
in
los
angeles,
general
motors
would
have
not
promulgated
this
policy
whether
at
that
particular
time.
and
just
about
his
time,
an
internal
memorandum
was
written
within
the
general
motors
organization
which
i
think
shows
very
clearly
one
of
the
things
that
general
motors
was
concerned
of.
it's
only
admittedly
one
sentence
in
a
two
or
three-page
memorandum,
but
it
shows
to
me
general
motors'
recognition
of
what
the
problem
was.
this
is
the
statement,
the
bottom
of
page
736
of
the
record.
this
is
a
letter
signed
by
a
mr.
gilead
who
was
a
high
official
in
general
motors,
and
he
said
that,
“it
would
appear
that
one
of
the
real
hazards
of
condoning
this
type
of
operation
is
that
discount
prices
are
freely
quoted
by
large
portion
of
the
public.”
now,
the
letter
which
general
motors
sent
out
set
forth
a
company
policy
that
it
thought
selling
from
discount
houses
threatened
the
good
will
of
the
dealer
organizations.
it
said
that
these
sales
don't
represent
an
additional
iota
of
business
for
the
dealer
organization
who
off
of
the
factories
and
that
they
represent
no
savings
to
the
public
but
result
only
in
a
delusion
of
the
gross
profit
on
each
transaction
which
otherwise
be
made
by
the
franchise
dealers.
then
the
letter
went
on
and
pointed
out
at
page
756
of
the
record,
that
in
some
instances
these
sales
through
discount
houses
represent
the
establishment
of
a
second
and
unauthorized
sales
outlet
or
location
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
chevrolet
dealers
selling
agreements.
this
was
referenced
to
a
provision
in
the
franchise
contract
which
chevrolet
address
into
every
one
of
its
dealers
under
which
the
dealer
is
prohibited
without
the
advanced
written
approval
of
chevrolet
from
all
--
changing
his
place
of
business
or
from
opening
up
any
branch
location.
and
it
is
this
provision
which
general
motors
relies
on
primarily
as
a
defense
in
this
case.
the
letter
then
concluded
that
the
chevrolet
wholesale
organization
would
discuss
this
matter
with
each
of
the
dealers
in
those
areas
where
such
activity
is
reported
to
exist
and
ask
them
to
review
their
operations
in
the
light
of
the
critical
nature
of
the
problem.
in
other
words,
this
letter
made
it
quite
clear
that
in
the
area
where
discount
houses'
selling
was
taking
place,
that
is,
at
this
time
los
angeles,
that
this
matter
was
being
brought
to
the
attention
of
all
the
dealers.
the
general
motors
is
making
clear
to
all
the
dealers
in
the
area
that
it
didn't
want
them
to
sell
through
discount
houses.
apparently,
it
paid
heed
to
mr.
o'connor's
belief
that
for
the
dealers
to
give
this
up,
they
would
have
to
receive
some
assurances
that
the
others
wouldn't
pick
it
up.
and
the
general
motors
management
instructed
the
personnel
to
meet
with
every
dealer
in
the
office
and
bring
this
letter
to
their
attention.
the
dealers
who
were
reported
to
have
been
selling
through
discount
houses
in
los
angeles,
there
were
seven
of
them
who
were
the
principal
sellers,
were
singled
out
to
special
treatment.
the
manager
of
the
pacific
coast
region
for
general
motors
which
is
the
echelon
above
the
los
angeles
zone
was
a
mr.
cash.
and
mr.
cash
was
instructed
to
meet
personally
with
every
one
of
these
dealers.
he
met
with
six
or
seven
of
them.
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
lower
echelon
management
people
in
the
los
angeles
office
were
instructed
to
get
in
touch
and
either
meet
or
call
all
of
the
other
dealers.
and
a
general
motors
official
in
detroit
subsequently
explained
in
the
memorandum
that
the
reason
this
was
done
was
that
in
order
that
every
dealer
with
whom
the
subject
was
discussed
would
know
that
a
similar
discussion
being
held
with
all
other
dealers
so
that
if
certain
dealers
should
elect
to
discontinue
their
cooperation
with
the
discount
house,
we
might
be
able
to
discourage
some
other
dealer
who
might
be
solicited
from
starting
the
practice,
that's
at
record
874.
and
the
los
angeles
manager
that
stated
at
record
158
to
159
that
they
knew
that
100%
cooperation
in
discontinuing
this
discount
house
business
was
essential
to
the
success
of
the
program
to
end
this
type
of
selling.
in
other
words,
once
again,
a
recognition
by
the
general
motors
peak
management
that
everybody
had
to
be
assured
the
problem
was
being
dealt
with.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
but
we
have
just
selected
orange
county,
mr.
justice,
they
were
selling
in
other
areas
as
well.
but
orange
county
is
where
most
--
the
area
to
which
most
of
the
focus
was
directed
because
this
is
the
source
of
the
complaints
that
originated
that
came
to
general
motors
that
led
them
to
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
most.
there
were
several
of
them
located.
there
is
mr.
justice
a
map
facing
page
20
of
the
appellee's
brief,
the
colored
map.
and
it
shows
locations
of
the
chevrolet
dealers
and
of
the
discount
houses.
the
chevrolet
dealers
are
shown
in
blue,
the
discount
houses
are
shown
in
red
and
the
orange
county
area
is
to
the
lower
right-hand
part
of
the
map
where
you
will
see
five
red
dots
rather
clustered.
and
general
motors
has
filed
with
the
court
a
much
larger
operation
of
this
map
which
is
legible
and
there's
a
key
on
the
record
showing
the
numbers
so
that
you
can
identify
the
particular
dealers
and
the
particular
discount
houses
with
the
particular
dots.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
los
angeles
area
dealers
needing
to
have
with
every
--
there
are
85
authorized
chevrolet
dealers
in
this
whole
area,
there's
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
i
don't
set
a
number
of
them,
five
or
six,
at
least,
i
would
say.
now,
i
think
it's
something
else
that
is
quite
significant
here
that
general
motors
is
very
explicit
to
its
dealers
and
that
to
its
management.
the
dealers
were
all
to
be
met
with
individually
not
in
groups.
each
dealer
was
to
be
met
with
individually.
and
the
vice
president
of
general
motors
mr.
roche
pressed
on
this
on
the
cross-examinations
to
why
this
why
was
done
and
he
finally
explained
at
record
399,
at
the
top
of
the
page,
and
was
asked,
“why
was
not
done
in
a
group
basis”
and
the
answer
was
“because
if
it
were
handled
on
a
group
basis,
i
suppose
we
could've
been
charged
with
a
conspiracy,
in
conspiring
with
the
dealers
as
a
group
to
accomplish
this
discount
house
referral
elimination.”
now,
mr.
cash
called
in
and
met
with
six
of
the
dealers
who
are
the
principle
people
in
selling
through
discount
houses.
he
had
private
meetings
with
every
one
of
them.
he
met
with
them
very
briefly
for
about
five
minutes
at
his
own
headquarters.
in
each
instance,
he
asked
them
if
they
had
read
the
letter
they
had
and
reviewed
the
letter
with
them,
and
then
he
said,
“this
is
our
policy
and
we'd
like
you
to
reconsider
your
discount
house
operations
in
the
light
of
this
policy.”
and
not
surprisingly,
all
of
the
dealers
agreed
and
indicated
in
the
circumstances,
some
of
them
decided,
they
waited
for
a
few
days
and
see
what
the
others
were
doing
to
terminate
these
actions.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice,
let
me
take
a
look
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
understand
your
question
mr.
chief
justice.
your
question
was
whether
there
were
any
discount
sales
--
discount
houses
located
in
los
angeles
itself,
is
that?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know.
i
believe
there
were
but
most
of
the
discount
houses,
the
large
discount
houses
apparently
were
located
in
the
suburban
area
and
i
think
this
intends
to
be
a
phenomenon
of
this
type
of
operation.
they
need
a
tremendous
area
and
they
tend
to
be
located
some
distance
out
of
the
downtown
area
where
they
can
get
a
lot
of
space
and
have
adequate
parking
facility.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
know,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
there
are
a
number
of
discount
houses
there
too.
there
are
23
of
them
near
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
no,
mr.
justice
we
brought
into
the
case
all
of
the
transactions.
there
were
some
apparently
transactions
with
discount
houses
in
los
angeles.
we
put
all
of
them
in
but
all
that
i
said
was
that
the
evidence
in
the
case
focuses
--
tends
to
focus
on
orange
county
because
it
was
the
dealer
was
in
orange
county
who
brought
this
matter
to
the
attention
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
general
motors.
and
that's
where
the
principle,
at
least
some
of
the
most
objectionable
from
the
point
of
view
of
dealers
selling
was
taking
place.
and
as
result
of
these
conferences
and
these
discussions,
these
dealers
terminated
selling
through
discount
houses
very
abruptly
in
a
matter
of
the
week
or
two
that
was
end
of
it.
but
the
mere
termination
of
these
practices
wasn't
enough,
because
general
motors
recognized
that
even
if
they
got
the
dealers
to
stop
initially,
they'd
have
to
police
this
matter.
they'd
have
to
make
sure
that
the
dealers
didn't
resume
it.
and
after
mr.
cash
had
reported
sometime
in
january
to
general
motors
of
the
success
of
these
initial
meetings
in
terminating
the
sales
through
discount
houses,
it
was
then
agreed
between
the
parties
that
after
a
little
time
had
elapsed,
it
would
be
well
for
mr.
cash,
and
this
is
at
record
874
a
letter,
“it
would
be
well
for
mr.
cash
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
to
actually
shop
some
of
the
discount
houses
in
order
to
see
if
any
chevrolet
dealers
were
still
corroborating
with
them.”
and
indeed
this
letter
which
was
dated
on
january
18
pointed
out
that
mr.
cash
had
been
asked
to
start
his
shopping
the
next
day.
and
when
mr.
cash
mentioned
to
mr.
o'connor
the
next
day,
the
los
angeles
manager
that
he
had
these
instruction
was
about
to
do
it,
start
it
in,
o'connor
said
there
was
no
need
to
do
it
at
that
time,
because
he
said
he
had
been
told
that
the
dealers
themselves
intended
to
do
some
shopping
and
see
if
there
was
still
any
sales
through
discount
houses.
now,
this
was
about
the
time
when
the
three
dealer
associations
hired
a
professional
shopper
for
a
$1000
a
month
to
go
out
and
shop
for
new
chevrolets.
each
of
these
associations
contributed
$5000
to
a
fund
to
be
used
to
purchase
new
chevrolet.
and
in
the
next
three
months,
the
shopper
and
his
assistants
purchased
seven
cars
at
various
discount
houses
that
were
supplied
by
some
of
the
los
angeles
dealers
to
them.
in
each
case
when
the
shopper
went
along
he
had
a
little
tape
recorder
with
him
in
which
he
got
a
recording
of
actually
what
was
going
on
including
the
identity,
of
course,
of
the
dealer
who
was
delivering
the
car.
he
then
turned
over
both
the
tapes
and
the
cars
which
have
been
obtained
and
the
documents
of
the
title
to
mr.
o'connor,
the
zone
manager
in
los
angeles.
and
this
of
course
was
the
man
who
told
mr.
cash
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
at
that
time
to
do
any
shopping
because
he
understood
what
the
dealers
were
doing.
when
the
dealers
told
him
about
the
first
car
they
were
shopping
and
asked
him
if
he'd
like
to
see
this
evidence,
he
said
he
would.
now,
when
the
zone
office
in
los
angeles
got
this
material,
this
proof
of
the
discount
house
shopping,
they
then
called
in,
in
each
case,
the
dealer
who
had
let
the
car
be
sold
through
the
discount
house.
they
called
him
into
the
office,
they
played
the
tape
recording
back
to
him,
to
the
dealer's
apparent
embarrassment
in
many
instances,
and
then
they
asked
him
would
he
like
to
repurchase
the
car.
in
every
instance,
the
dealer
said
he
would,
and
the
dealers
purchased
these
cars
back,
even
though
in
several
cases,
they
had
to
pay
to
make
the
check
out
for
more
than
they
had
sold
it
for.
and
then
after
mr.
o'connor
received
the
money
for
the
repurchase
of
the
car,
he
in
turn
turned
it
over
to
an
attorney
who
was
the
agent
of
the
three
associations
which
had
arranged
for
this
shopping
of
cars.
now
these
are
the
basic
facts.
now,
there're
some
details
in
the
record
that
these
were
basic
facts.
and
in
discussing
the
fact,
i
would
like
to
take
two
aspects
of
the
case.
first,
rather
briefly,
is
what
i
would
call
the
horizontal
aspect
of
the
case.
that
is
our
claim
that
there
was
a
horizontal
conspiracy
at
the
same
level
of
distribution,
the
conspiracy
among
the
dealers
in
the
association
and
that
general
motors
then
joined
in
it
and
implemented
it.
and
the
second
aspect
of
the
case
which
is
--
which
most
of
our
brief
is
directed
which
is
what
i
will
call
the
vertical.
that
is
the
question
of
validity
of
general
motors
applying
its
franchise
agreements
to
prevent
the
dealers
from
selling
through
discount
houses.
now
as
far
as
the
horizontal
aspect
of
the
conspiracy
is
concerned,
what
we
have
here
is
that
as
early
as
june,
the
losor
deal
has
all
got
together
and
decided
they
ought
to
get
do
something
to
persuade
general
motors
to
stop
this
discount
house
selling.
they
went
to
the
local
zone
manager.
he
told
them
he
couldn't
do
anything
about
it,
they
needed
stronger
--
stronger
measures
were
in
order.
some
of
the
dealers
they
had
spoken
to
tell
them
they
wouldn't
give
up
discount
house
selling,
it
was
a
profitable
business
unless
they
had
some
assurances
that
the
other
people
doing
the
same
thing
would
also
give
it
up
and
it's
obvious,
only
general
motors
itself
who
would
be
able
to
provide
that
assurance.
then
the
dealers
decided
to
send
letters
--
agreed
to
send
letters
and
communications
to
general
motors
protesting
about
it.
in
response
to
these
protests,
general
motors
then
implemented
and
announced
this
policy
against
discount
housing.
they
dramatically
brought
it
home
to
the
offending
dealers
in
the
area
who
were
selling
through
the
discount
houses
by
these
private
meetings
with
mr.
cash.
incidentally,
several
of
the
dealers
testified,
this
was
the
first
time
they'd
ever
had
a
private
meeting
with
that
high
an
official
of
general
motors.
and
it
didn't
require
much
in
the
way
of
persuasion.
certainly,
no
threats
turned
the
trick,
five
minute
meeting
was
enough.
mr.
cash
indicated
the
policy
and
at
that
point
the
dealers
agreed
to
go
along
with
it.
and
also
at
the
same
time,
general
motors
made
it
quite
clear
that
it
was
bringing
this
policy
home
to
all
the
dealers
in
the
area.
in
other
words,
dealers
who
discontinued
dealing
with
discount
houses
was
quite
clear
to
them
that
a
similar
pitch
was
being
made
to
the
rest
of
them.
and
the
result
of
all
of
this
was
a
virtually
complete
closing
off
to
the
discount
houses
of
their
sources
of
supply
of
new
chevrolets.
and
a
substantial
number
of
people,
2000
in
1960,
who
previously
had
looked
to
the
discount
houses
for
their
chevrolets
could
no
longer
look
to
that
source
of
supply.
and
then
to
make
sure
that
the
practice
was
stopped,
general
motors
with
the
help
of
these
three
associations
vigorously
policed
the
dealers.
they
practice
a
type
of
enforcement
which
it
did
itself
recognize
was
necessary.
so
even
if
what
we
have
in
this
case
here,
this
aspect
of
it
is
joint
concerted
effort
between
general
motors
and
the
dealers
to
stop
the
sale
of
new
chevrolets
through
discount
houses
and
to
present
--
prevent
any
resumption
of
it,
it
was
a
plan
that
was
organized,
instigated
by
the
dealers
but
one
that
could
not
be
made
effective
without
the
cooperation
and
assistance
of
general
motors.
general
motors,
in
response
to
the
organizers,
requests
and
protests
did
bring
its
power
to
bear
and
it
therefore
effectuated
and
implemented
the
plan.
and
we
think
that
this
comes
within
the
decisions
of
this
court
recognizing
that
a
--
such
a
concerted
refusal
to
deal
is
a
per
se
boycott.
the
facts
in
some
of
the
cases,
as
our
opponents
point
out
in
their
briefs,
are
different.
of
course,
they're
different
but
the
basic
philosophy
of
those
cases
that
traders
cannot
get
together
and
bring
and
prevent
--
themselves
get
together
and
prevent
dealing
with
someone
else,
it
seems
to
us,
applies
here.
now,
the
second
issue
in
the
case
involves
the
vertical
restraints
so-called.
that
is
the
claim
of
general
motors
that
by
in
stopping
its
dealers
from
dealing
through
discount
houses,
it
was
merely
enforcing
the
branch
location
provision.
now,
we
consider
--
get
to
this
issue
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
a
question
of
relief.
if
the
court
were
to
accept
our
argument
on
the
horizontal
conspiracy,
it's
not
clear
to
us
that
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
relief
not
just
against
the
conspiracy
itself,
but
also
the
relief
which
we
sought
in
our
complaint
limiting
general
motors
in
preventing
the
--
limiting
general
motors
from
saying
to
its
dealers
whom
you
can
deal
with.
in
other
words,
the
--
we
think
the
vice,
the
vice
of
this
thing
in
terms
of
its
impact
on
competition
is
stopping
the
dealers
from
dealing
with
the
discount
houses.
and
unless
there
is
some
relief
that
prevents
general
motors
unilaterally
from
doing
the
same
thing,
we
don't
think
we've
accomplished
any
great
deal
if
all
we
get
is
act
of
relief
against
concerted
action.
we
think
that
the
theory
of
our
case
is
broad
enough
to
give
us
this
relief
and
we
asked
for
it
in
the
complaint
but
we
don't
know
whether
we
would
get.
therefore,
we
cannot
say
that
getting
--
winning
--
if
we
would
win
the
case
on
the
conspiracy
ground,
that
would
necessarily
give
us
to
all
the
relief
we're
entitled
and
therefore
we
find
ourselves
compelled
to
reach
the
second
issue.
the
second
point
of
the
case
is
that
this,
of
course,
was
the
ground
on
which
general
motors
defended.
this
issue
was
injected
into
the
case
by
general
motors,
defense
of
the
franchise
system.this
was
the
issue
to
which
most
of
its
evidence
was
introduced.
now,
i
have
to
state,
in
all
candor,
that
at
the
trial
level,
we
did
state
that
one
or
two
times
that
we
were
basing
our
case
on
conspiracy
and
that
we
were
not
attacking
the
contract
as
such.
and
to
that
extent,
the
position
here
is
somewhat
inconsistent
with
that.
on
the
other
hand,
it's
clear
that
there's
no
possible
prejudice
could
result
to
general
motors
from
this
issue.
they
put
in
their
complete
defense
on
this
issue.
they
put
in
every
possible
justification
for
it,
and
we
think
that
the
record
before
this
court,
these
three
ones
is
now
fully
adequate
for
the
court
to
resolve
the
issue.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
say
that
general
--
we
say
the
case
against
general
motors
works
on
two
theories.
the
first
one
is
the
so-called
horizontal
conspiracy.
the
second
one
is
that
general
motors
has
these
agreements
and
by
enforcing
the
agreement
against
each
dealer
so
as
to
bar
the
sales
from
discount
houses,
this
in
effect
added
into
a
combination
with
them.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
answer
to
your
earlier
question
as
to
where
in
the
record
there
is
more
detailed
description
of
the
function
into
the
discount
houses
system,
i'd
like
to
refer
you
to
pages
176
to
178,
183
to
187
and
187
to
188.
the
first
of
these
are
two
bits
of
evidence
presented
by
people
in
the
discount
house
and
of
themselves,
and
the
third
one
is
a
statement
by
a
salesman,
one
of
the
dealers
who
dealt
with
the
discount
houses.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
in
describing
the
franchise
system,
first
to
basically
explain
to
the
court
as
we
understand
what
general
motors
argument
is,
and
then
to
show
why
we
don't
think
the
argument
holds
up.
general
motors'
argument
is
basically
this.
general
motors
said
--
says
that
over
the
past
30
or
40
years,
it
has
had
a
great
deal
of
experience
and
merchandising
automobiles.
that
it
has
made
great
many
studies
and
knows
intimately
all
the
details
of
the
marketing
practices,
the
buying
practices
of
costumers,
and
it
is
therefore
able
to
pinpoint
in
a
particular
area
just
how
many
dealers
there
should
be
and
where
the
dealers
should
be
put.
in
other
words,
in
the
los
angeles
area,
the
general
motors
on
the
basis
of
all
these
marketing
surveys
has
concluded
that
85
dealers
is
the
optimum
number
for
selling
chevrolets.
and
also
the
places
throughout
the
area
where
the
dealers
have
been
located
are
the
best
possible
places
in
terms
of
providing
each
dealer
with
a
sufficient
profit
potential
for
his
market
so
that
he
will
be
willing
to
make
the
investment
that
is
required
for
the
premises
of
a
functioning
and
efficient
dealer.
now,
they
then
say
the
next
thing
that
the
branch
location
provision
which
general
motors
has
put
in
its
dealer
franchise
since
1940
that
is
a
purpose
of
avoiding
a
proliferation
of
dealer
outlets.
in
other
words,
if
general
motors
decides
that
in
a
particular
area
there
should
be
only
five
chevrolet
dealers,
five
authorized
chevrolet
dealers,
if
a
dealer
were
permitted
to
open
three
branches
you
would
have
not
five
but
seven,
and
therefore
says
general
motors
that
provision
is
designed
to
prevent
undue
proliferation.
they
then
say
that
in
terms
of
the
impact
on
the
dealers,
in
terms
of
the
purpose
for
which
the
system
is
set
up,
permitting
sales
through
discount
houses
has
the
identical
effect,
insofar
as
the
impact
in
the
franchise
system
is
concerned,
as
opening
up
a
branch
house.
and
then
they
conclude
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
do
not
question
that
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
we're
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
would
appear
to
be
a
branch
--
a
true
branch
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don't
question
that
here.
we
don't
find
it
necessary
to
question.
we
do
not
concede
that
in
all
circumstances
even
that
kind
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
--
all
we
have
is
the
open
--
another
branch
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
just
don't
know
that
mr.
justice,
what
the
answer
to
that.
i
think
we'd
have
--
it's
a
difficult
case
--
it's
a
more
difficult
case
from
this
one.
on
the
other
hand
there
is
the
aspect
that
he
is
in
the
discount
house
itself
and
to
what
extent
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
would
seem
to
be
clearly
within
the
type
of
thing
of
the
branch
location
provision
on
its
phase
is
directed
against
and
which
we're
not
attacking
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
might,
i
don't
know.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
the
franchise
is
given
ordinarily
for
particular
location,
and
the
so-called
branch
location
provision
provides
that
without
the
written
consent
of
general
motors,
the
dealer
shall
not
establish
another
place
of
business
or
a
branch
location.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
they
would
come
within
the
literal
terms
of
the
branch
location
provision.
now,
i'd
like
to
indicate
why
we
think
this
application
of
the
branch
location
provision
to
barring
sales
through
discount
houses
is
quite
a
different
matter
than
the
typical
situation
where
general
motors
says
to
a
dealer,
“no,
you
can't
open
a
branch.”
the
basic
--
the
first
thing,
of
course,
is
it
seems
to
me
it
has
a
quite
different
effect
on
competition
in
this
situation.
if
general
motors
says
to
a
dealer,
“mr.
dealer,
we
got
85
locations
in
los
angeles
and
we
don't
think
there
should
be
an
86th
one.”
barring
the
dealer
from
opening
another
branch
does
not
in
terms
directly
block
off
a
new
method
of
merchandising
which
stresses
price
above
all.
all
that
that
really
does
is
preserves
general
motors'
business
judgment
that
85
is
the
maximum
number
of
dealers.
but
it
seems,
and
as
far
as
the
public
is
concerned,
this
additional
outlet
would
appear
to
be
another
authorized
chevrolet
dealer.
it
would
have
the
dealer's
name
to
make
it
clear
that
he
is
the
chevrolet
outlet.
but
it
seems
to
us
it's
a
big
jump
from
that.
it's
a
big
jump
from
that
to
say
that
because
general
motors
can
bar
its
dealers
from
opening
another
location
that
it
could
also
bar
the
dealers
themselves
from
a
method
of
merchandising
through
which
they
obtain
costumers
not
through
the
efforts
of
their
own
salesman,
not
through
the
effort
just
because
people
happen
to
walk
in
the
door
of
their
shop
but
because
the
costumers
are
referred
to
them
by
another
outlet.
that's
really
what
is
involved
in
this
case.
what
is
involved
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
i
may
answer
you
mr.
justice
with
a
slight
variation
of
that,
the
dealer
of
course
does
not
have
any
kind
of
control
over
the
discount
house
operation.
we
are
prepared
to
defend
the
case.
we
don't
question
the
decision
--
finding
below
that
we
treat
the
case
that
general
motors
--
we're
not
questioning
the
general
motors'
interpretation
of
the
branch
location
provision.
i'll
put
it
this
way.
we
don't
question
the
interpretation
that
the
branch
location
provision
applies
to
discount
houses
sale.
we're
not
questioning
general
motors'
statement
in
the
letter
that
in
some
instances
selling
through
discount
houses
may
constitute
the
opening
of
a
second
outlet.
we
do
say
that
if
the
contract
is
thus
construed
and
applied,
we
don't
think
it's
proper,
that's
our
attack
on
the
contract.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
so,
mr.
justice.
we're
prepared
to
treat
the
case
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
analytically,
the
case
we
think
is
no
different
than
if
general
motors
franchise
agreement
had
in
it
an
explicit
provision
barring
the
dealer
from
selling
through
discount
house.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
we
are
prepared
to
concede.
we
do
not
challenge,
put
it
this
way,
if
i
may
again,
we
do
not
here
challenge
general
motors'
view
that
selling
through
the
discount
house
may
constitute
the
establishment
of
a
branch.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
would
seem
to
me
that
there
would
certainly
be
--
i
suppose
the
general
--
or
the
dealer
can
appoint
anyone
as
a
salesman
it
wishes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
if
--
i'm
sorry,
if
they
had
a
--
if
they
appointed
--
if
for
all
they
said
was
that
we
have
traveling
salesman,
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
he's
not
a
--
there's
no
chevrolet
outlet
there,
i
take
it.
i'm
not
quite
--
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
quite
clear
as
to
the
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
it
would
seem
to
me
this
is
very
similar
to
what
they're
doing.
it's
not
quite
as
formal
in
the
sense,
but
it
would
see
--
it
would
seem
to
me
that
they
--
the
dealer
had
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
referral
fee.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
a
well
recognized
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
there's
a
well
recognized
practice
in
the
industry
which
is
referred
to
in
this
record,
something
called
bird
dogging.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
bird
dogging.
bird
dogging
apparently
is
where
there's
a
--
say
a
gasoline
station
and
one
of
the
fellows
there
has
some
arrangement
with
the
dealer
and
he
says
to
you,
“hey,
if
you
want
to
get
a
good
bargain
and
a
new
chevy,
go
see
my
friend
so
and
so.”
you
go
see
his
friend
so
and
so
and
make
a
deal,
like
kickback
a
few
dollars
to
this
fellow
who
bird
dogged
a
deal
to
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
this
would
depend
on
the
two
types
of
transactions.
in
the
so-called
discount
house,
it
was
the
discount
house
would
make
the
trade-in,
the
determination
of
the
trade-in
on
the
used
cars
(voice
overlap).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
they
--
apparently
they
--
i
gather
from
--
the
record
isn't
entirely
clear
but
the
discount
houses
apparently
have
some
kind
of
relationship
frequently
with
used
car
owners.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
as
far
as
--
the
record
isn't
clear
on
that
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
it
doesn't
appear
it's
for
the
account
of
the
dealer.
now,
i
mean,
i
don't
know,
for
all
i
know
the
discount
houses
might
have
some
understandings
with
the
dealer
about
turning
them
over
but
the
record
does
not
show
how
it
is
done.
but
the
record
does
indicate
if
a
costumer
comes
in,
in
one
of
these
discount
house
operations
with
a
used
car,
the
discount
house
will
make
an
arrangement
with
him
on
the
trade.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
you
say
as
if
they
were,
in
one
sense
yes,
in
another
sense
no.
i
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
let
me
see
if
i
can
explain,
i
--
put
my
theory
this
way.
we
think
there's
a
tremendously
different
impact
on
competition
where
what
is
done
is
prevent
selling
through
a
discount
house
and
where
what
is
done
is
prohibiting
the
establishment
of
a
branch
location.
and
the
reason
for
that,
we
think,
is
that
they're
quite
more
--
far
more
as
the
theory
has
adverse
impact
on
competition
when
what
is
done
is
stopping
through
discount
houses,
because
this
is
a
manner
of
merchandising.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
don't
throw
any
distinction,
mr.
justice.
indeed,
general
motors
concede,
general
motors
admits,
that
if
the
dealer
were
selling
to
the
discount
house
there's
no
way
they
could
stop
them.
and
yet
in
terms
of
the
impact
of
this
thing
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
we
might
well.
you
said
you
cannot
sell
for
resale
--
yes
i
think
one,
i
think
under
the
antitrust
laws,
once
they
parted
with
all
their
interest
in
the
car,
that's
the
most
they
can
do.
now,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
a
few
other
points
here
in
connection
with
the
distinction
between
discount
house
selling
on
the
one
hand
and
merely
establishment
of
a
branch
location
on
the
other.
the
--
as
i've
indicated
the
branch
location
provision
was
inserted
in
the
contract
25
years
ago
at
general
motors'
own
insistence
because
general
motors
apparently
believed
this
was
significant
in
merchandising
its
cars.
the
other
provisions
of
the
contract
--
i'm
sorry,
the
application
of
the
contract
to
discount
house
selling
was
done
by
general
motors
at
the
instigation
of
the
dealers.
and
indeed,
the
general
motors'
president
had
testified
that
they
wouldn't
have
acquired
the
policy
at
that
time
were
it
not
for
the
dealers
pressure.
and
the
effort
seems
clear
to
us
that
in
this
particular
situation
this
was
--
general
motors
applied
this
not
because
of
any
decision
on
its
own
that
this
was
necessary
for
the
efficient
merchandising
of
automobiles
but
in
response
to
the
pressure.
now,
i
think
there's
something
very
significant
here
in
determining
just
what
this
franchise
--
the
effect
of
this
thing
is.
the
president
of
general
motors
testified,
at
page
423
of
the
record,
that
if
a
salesman
from
glendale
county,
which
glendale
which
is
a
suburb
of
los
angeles,
came
into
orange
county.
and
if
he
started
to
sell
there
that
they
say
would
not
pose
any
threat
to
the
franchise
system.
if
it
seems
to
us
in
terms
of
the
concern
of
deluding
the
deal
of
potential,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
how
it
gets
in.
the
important
thing
is,
if
dealers
for
example
from
outside
of
the
area
started
to
come
into
orange
county
to
sell
vigorously
and
if
they
began
to
stress
price
cutting,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
impact
on
the
franchise
system
which
is
the
whole
basis
on
which
general
motors
attempts
to
base
its
case
would
be
the
same.
and
yet
they
concede
that
in
that
situation,
there
wouldn't
be
any
impact.
now,
there's
plenty
of
intra-brand
competition
in
los
angeles
that
has
to
be
conceded.
there
are
85
dealers,
and
certainly
general
motors
as
the
largest
manufacturer
of
automobiles
cannot
contend
that
this
limitation,
this
bar
in
selling
through
discount
houses
is
necessary
for
general
motors
to
compete
effectively
against
the
other
brands
of
manufacturers.
indeed,
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
the
discount
houses
were
selling
all
makes
of
automobiles
not
just
chevrolets.
and
if
in
fact
general
motors
starts
--
prohibits
its
dealers
from
selling
to
these
cars
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
any
of
the
other
manufacturers
to
stop
their
deals
from
selling,
in
the
long
run,
it
seems
to
me
it's
likely
to
hurt
general
motors
in
its
position
against
the
other
cars
rather
than
to
help
it
because
people
may
be
prepared
to
buy
a
general
motors
car
when
they
walk
into
the
discount,
but
if
they
find
they
can't
get
a
chevy
through
the
discount
house,
they
can
only
get
a
ford
or
plymouth.
it
seems
to
me
not
at
all
unlikely
that
they
will
suddenly
decide
to
shift
over,
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
believe,
i
have
a
couple
of
minutes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
just
like,
two
things,
first
to
refer
briefly
to
this
question
of
the
participation
of
the
associations,
i'd
like
to
provide
the
court's
attention
to
finding
42
which
specifically
refers
to
the
association's
participation
in
the
policing.
and
in
addition
to
that,
of
course,
the
associations
acted
through
the
members.
that
was
what
happened
was
the
associations
that
met
them
and
the
members
went
on.
now,
coming
to
the
merits
of
the
thing,
i'd
like
to
make
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
42,
we
think,
supports
us
because
it
shows
that
the
associations
did
participate
in
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
the
final
thing
--
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
this,
there's
been
a
lot
of
discussion
here
as
to
whether
discount
houses
do
give
peoples
bargains
or
don't
give
people
bargains.
if
they
don't,
if
in
fact
the
discount
houses
aren't
charging
more
than
the
other
dealers,
it
seems
to
me
sooner
or
later
they're
going
to
go
by
the
way
side.
you
can
fool
some
of
the
people
some
other
time,
but
we
know
you
can't
fool
them
all
of
the
time,
and
over
a
long
period
of
time,
these
discount
houses
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
survive
if
the
people
who
believe
they're
getting
bargains
find
out
they're
not.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
if
what
all
of
these
complaining
dealers
and
salesman
said
about
this
situation
was
true
that
the
discount
houses
were
undercutting,
that
the
dealers
were
unable
to
make
sales
because
of
the
lower
prices
given
by
the
discount
houses,
then
it
seems
to
me
they
chose
one
of
two
things.
either
it
indicates
that
somehow
the
franchise
method
of
distribution
is
not
as
efficient
as
it
supposed
to
be
or
alternatively,
it
suggests
that
perhaps
the
competition
among
the
dealers
isn't
as
vigorous
as
it
should
be.
because
the
discount
house
starts,
it
starts
its
competitive
position
under
a
very
great
financial
handicap.
the
dealer
buys
his
car
from
general
motors
at
a
stated
price.
the
discount
house,
in
order
to
compete
against
the
dealer,
pays
not
only
the
price
that
the
dealer
paid,
because
the
dealer
turns
it
over
to
him,
but
also
another
profit
for
dealer
and
enters
into,
so
that
makes
out
of
the
deal,
so
that
the
discount
house
starts
with
a
distinct
competitive
advantage.
now,
if
in
fact
over
a
period
of
time,
these
discount
houses
despite
that
competitive
handicap
are
able
to
prosper,
if
a
large
number
of
people
prefer
to
buy
cars
that
way,
if
they
think
they're
getting
bargains
they
continue
to
get
those
bargains,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
basically
what
the
antitrust
law
is
designed
to
permit,
to
allow
a
new
type
of
merchandising.
to
allow
a
situation
which
although
like
in
some
respectsa
branch
location,
it
is
a
place
where
cars
are
sold
in
a
terminal
location,
there's
many
difference
as
far
as
the
public
are
concerned.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
whole
thing
about
this
is
to
impact
on
competition
and
if
in
fact
these
discount
houses
are
able
to
survive
despite
these
competitive
handicaps,
it
suggests
to
us
quite
clearly
and
they're
popular
that
if
general
motors
tries
to
eliminate
them,
this
we
think
does
constitute
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
think
as
far
as
the
franchise
agreement
is
concerned,
we
do
not
--
that
is
not
--
would
not
give
us
relief
against
the
associations,
because
the
associations
we
don't
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
--
i'm
sorry
--
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice.
on
our
conspiracy
aspect
of
the
case,
we
do
have
to
overturn
44
because
we
think
there
was
a
conspiracy
at
an
implied
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right,
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right,
but
not
to
reach
general
motors
on
the
franchise.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
yes.
