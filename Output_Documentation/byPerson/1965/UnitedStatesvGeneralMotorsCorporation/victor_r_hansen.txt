mr.
victor
r.
hansen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
three
appellee
dealers
association,
losor
is
made
up
of
a
group
of
small
businessmen
who
are
chevrolet
dealers
in
a
portion
of
los
angeles
county
and
a
portion
of
orange
county.
the
other
dealer
association,
dealer
service,
is
made
up
also
of
a
group
of
independent
businessmen
who
are
chevrolet
dealers
in
the
los
angeles
city
area.
the
foothill
dealers
association
is
made
up
of
also
chevrolet
dealers
partially
in
los
angeles
county,
san
bernardino
county
and
a
couple
in
riverside
county.
these
organizations
were
formed
many
years
ago.
they
are
not
in
any
way
connected
with,
controlled
by
or
supervised
by
general
motors.
they
were
organized
for
three
main
purposes.
there
are
so
many
different
models
and
colors
and
accessories
that
can
be
placed
on
chevrolet
automobiles
that
were
enable
for
a
dealer
to
get
the
model
that
he
desires
for
his
costumer.
he
can
call
his
dealers
association
that
maintains
what
is
known
as
a
trading
bureau
or
information
bureau.
they
have
a
list
of
the
inventory
of
all
the
dealers
in
the
association
and
can
readily
make
known
to
the
inquiring
dealer
where
he
might
purchase
or
trade
with
another
dealer
to
get
the
automobile
that
he
wants.
in
addition
to
that,
the
dealers
association
enables
the
dealers
to
have
joint
advertisers.
and
as
a
third
reason
or
purpose
for
the
association,
they
are
able
to
study
the
problems
of
automobile
merchandising
and
recommend
legislation.
and
in
this
case,
there
is
evidence
of
the
effect
that
such
association
did
recommend
legislation
to
the
state
legislature.
now,
we
are
making
two
points.
the
first
point
is
that
the
appellant
had
raise
no
question
whatsoever
which
relates
to
the
dealers
association.
the
question
in
the
notice
of
appeal,
the
question
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
the
questions
in
the
brief
they
were
one
each
in
the
former
and
there
are
two
in
the
brief.
whether
the
agreement
between
general
motors
and
each
of
its
chevrolet
dealers,
the
los
angeles
area
forbidding
the
dealer
to
sell
cars
to
discount
houses
unreasonably
restrains
trade
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
and
second,
whether
the
chevrolet
dealers
in
the
los
angeles
area
illegally
conspired
among
themselves
and
with
general
motors
to
suppress
such
sale.
there
is
not
an
iota
of
evidence
of
any
agreement,
association
or
conspiracy
as
between
general
motors
and
the
dealers
association.
there
is
no
contention
made
but
there
was
and
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
association
agreement
or
conspiracy
between
the
chevrolet
dealers,
general
motors
and
the
chevrolet
dealers
association.
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
mr.
justice
white,
i
heard
that,
but
there's
nothing
in
their
brief
there's
nothing
in
their
argument,
there's
nothing
in
the
evidence
that
would
justify
any
relief
and
it's
my
understanding
the
rule
is
equally
applicable
to
the
government
as
it's
applicable
to
private
parties
that
the
court
will
only
consider
those
matters
which
are
included
in
the
question
presented
to
the
court.
we
are
not
included
in
the
question
present
to
the
court.
now,
our
second
point
is
the
fact
that
let's
assume
for
argument
only
that
this
question
might
probably
--
pardon
me.
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
no,
there's
no
showing
that
they
did
it
through
the
association
then
all
dealers
are
not
members
of
the
association.
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
but
they
haven't
urged.
they
haven't
urged
it
any
where.
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
well,
for
the
first
time
i
heard
it
today
that
mr.
friedman
said
that
they
were
hoping
to
get
relief
against
the
association.
nowhere
have
they
--
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
pardon?
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
i
don't
think
so
because
i
don't
think
it's
within
the
question.
the
associations
hardly
even
mentioned
in
there,
the
associations
are
corporations,
nonprofit
corporations
and
there
are
many
other
members
of
the
dealers
who
are
dead
since
this
thing
started.
and
they
are
not
all
members
of
the
association.
now,
as
to
our
second
point
--
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
pardon?
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
they
are
not
--
the
dealers
are
not
parties
to
the
suit.
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
the
associations
are.
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
they
were
in
the
lower
court
were
contended
to
be
at
parties
that
part
of
the
alleged
conspiracy,
but
not
before
this
court.
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
well,
the
finding
was
the
appellee
dealer
association,
did
not
act
in
combination,
conspiracy
or
concert
with
general
motors.
there
was
no
agreement
between
the
defendant
dealers
association
or
any
of
them,
and
general
motors
as
to
what
action
general
motors
would
take
or
whether
general
motors
would
take
any
action
at
all
with
respect
to
the
practice
by
some
chevrolet
dealers
of
selling
through
discount
houses
or
referral
services.
in
finding
44,
there
was
no
expressed
or
implied
agreement
between
defendant
associations
or
between
any
of
them
or
any
of
their
dealer
members
that
any
of
said
dealer
members
should
refrain
from
selling
through
discount
houses
or
referral
services.
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
well,
my
understanding
is
if
they
must
be
found
to
be
--
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
well
--
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
--
but
there
is
your
honor
--
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
there
is
no
iota
of
evidence
to
show
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
i
think
not.
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
not
even
that.
now,
as
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned,
the
facts
are
uncontradicted
that
the
first
meeting
of
the
dealers
association
occurred
on
december
15,
1960
and
that
general
motors
had
already
established
its
policy
and
announced
it
on
december
14th.
and
in
that
first
meeting
of
the
associations,
all
that
was
done
was
to
appoint
a
committee
to
investigate,
report
back
and
determine
what
legislative
action
might
be
taken
to
solve
this
problem.
and
there's
not
an
iota
of
evidence
that
the
association
requested
general
motors
or
any
of
the
associations
to
take
any
action
whatsoever.
i
see
my
time
is
--
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
the
associations
did
after
the
policy
had
been
announced
the
following
year,
did
employ
an
investigator
and
did
shop
for
the
purpose
of
whether
or
not
there
were
sales
--
still
sales
through
discount
houses.
and
there
also
is
evidence
uncontradicted
that
as
a
result
of
this
investigation,
a
representative
appeared
before
the
state
legislator
committee
hearings
and
submitted
the
evidence
and
that
that
legislative
committee
passed
the
bill
involving
the
problem
of
sales
through
discount
houses.
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
the
legislation
was
promotion
or
establishment
of
the
commission.
presently,
the
dealers
are
under
the
motor
vehicle
party
and
this
was
a
bill
that
established
a
commission
and
that
commission
was
to
have
representation
on
it
of
dealers.
and
the
purpose
of
it
was,
was
to
require
one
selling
new
automobiles
must
have
a
service
establishment.
none
of
the
discount
houses
or
several
referral
services
do
have
service
facilities.
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
not
here
because
it
passed
the
lower
house
but
did
not
pass
the
senate.
but
had
it,
if
one
of
the
purposes
to
see
that
there
was
a
proper
dealer
locations
services
rendered
and
service
available
and
parts
available.
mr.
victor
r.
hansen
they
did
after,
not
the
association
as
such,
but
members
of
the
association
did
advise
general
motors
of
it
but
only
after
the
alleged
conspiracy
to
call
general
motors
to
prevent
dealers
from
selling
through
discount
houses.
thank
you.
