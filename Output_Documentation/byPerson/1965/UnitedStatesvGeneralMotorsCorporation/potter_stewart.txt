discount
house
never

did
it?
justice

so
the
discount
house
was
an
agent,
i
suppose,
of
somebody?
justice
potter
stewart
a
sales
agent.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
sale,
i
think
this
is
clear
isn't
it,
was
directly
from
the
dealer
to
the
costumer?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
the
former
case
the
--
what
the
discount
house
got
was
a
commission
basically?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
see
why
the
discount
house
had
any
cost
if
it
never
owned
the
car.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
commission,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
the
second
case
it
was
a
flat
fee
per
reference?
justice
potter
stewart
on
each
referral
if
the
referral
turned
into
a
sale?
justice
potter
stewart
these
were
los
angeles
dealers
who
were
selling
through
discount
houses
in
orange
county
primarily?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
where
most
these
discount
houses
were
located?
justice
potter
stewart
you've
been
speaking
--
what
part
of
my
question
was
that
you've
been
speaking
of
the
los
angeles
dealers
and
i
wonder
if
you
were
talking
about
dealers
within
the
city
of
los
angeles
or
the
los
angeles
area
dealers
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
consisting
of
how
many
counties?
