warren
were
any
of
the
discount
houses
that
were
in
these
transactions
in
los
angeles
proper?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
because
there
were
no
such
transactions
or
because
you
only
choose
the
orange
county
place?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
correct.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
quite
a
suburban
area
around
los
angeles
in
los
angeles
properties.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
wondered
--
my
only
reason
for
asking

is
there
any
reason
why

there
were
any
transactions
with
discount

in
los
angeles
if
they
are
not
brought
into
the
case,
and
that
you
just
brought
in
orange
county
this

chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
know
that
it
has
any
materiality
but
why
is
it
cost
more
--
why
does
it
cost
more
for
a
chevrolet
from
a
dealer
in
orange
county
than
from
a
dealer
in
los
angeles?
