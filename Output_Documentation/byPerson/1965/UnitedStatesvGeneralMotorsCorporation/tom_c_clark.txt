suppose
i
was
the
dealer
in
los
angeles
and
i
knew
that
there
was
an
organization,
we'll
say,
of
standard
oil
station
employees
and
managers.
and
i
went
to
the
managers
meeting
one
day
at
noon
and
i
said,
“i
want
to
appoint
each
of
you
managers,
you
see
every
cars,
everyday
people
come
in
and
buy
gasoline.
i
want
to
appoint
each
one
of
you
managers
and
not
salesman.”

violate
your

wouldn't
have
any
cars
on
their
lots
or
on
their
stations
at
all
but
whenever
i
came
in

another
person
came
in
to
buy
gas,

that
and

say,
“say,

truck
pretty
old,
it
got
a
lot
of
knots
in
it.
i
got
a
friend
old
clark
down
the
street
here
and

of
the
sales
commission,
won't
you
go
down

give
you
a
good
deal.”
