mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
you
carry
this
all
with
the
aid
of
the
little
map
that
we
put
in
our
brief
at
page
20,
i
would
like
to
tell
you
about
los
angeles,
because
there
are
some
misconceptions
about
los
angeles
in
the
argument
of
the
appellant.
the
counties
involved
in
this
litigation
are
los
angeles
county
and
a
small
part
of
orange
county.
orange
county
extends
from
the
los
angeles
county
line
down
to
san
diego
county.
all
we
have
involved
in
this
litigation
is
los
angeles
county
and
a
little
piece
of
orange
county,
not
several
counties.
with
respect
to
the
city
of
los
angeles,
as
the
chief
justice
knows
and
no
doubt
many
of
you
know,
the
city
of
los
angeles
is
sprawled
all
over
the
place.
it
surrounds
the
city
of
beverly
hills
and
it's
very
difficult
as
one
drives
along
whether
you're
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
or
in
one
of
the
suburban
towns.
on
the
little
map
up
in
the
left
hand
corner
where
there
are
quite
a
number
of
discount
houses,
that's
san
fernando
valley
that's
at
city
of
los
angeles,
several
discount
houses.
actually,
there
are
18
discount
houses
in
los
angeles
county
of
which
several
of
them,
quite
a
number
of
them,
were
within
the
city
limits
of
los
angeles,
if
that's
of
any
importance.
commercially,
as
everyone
knows,
commercially
this
metropolitan
area
is
one
commercial
area
and
the
boundary
lines
don't
make
much
difference
except
for
political
purposes.
looking
at
the
name
los
angeles
there,
just
to
the
left
of
the
name
los
angeles
is
a
discount
house
4a,
just
below
that
is
another
discount
house
called
fleet
sales
inc.
just
below
that
is
another
discount
house
called
bedco,
just
off
to
the
left
of
that
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
is
another
discount
house
called
castle
sales.
so
this
matter
occurring
to
make
orange
county
heavy
in
this
matter
is
just
a
red
herring.
actually,
85%
of
the
transactions
certainly,
we
can
tell
for
sure
70%
of
the
discount
house
transactions
took
place
in
los
angeles
county,
and
because
several
of
these
operations
had
places
of
business
both
in
los
angeles
county
and
orange
county,
we
can't
be
sure.
but
a
fair
estimate
is
that
about
15%
of
the
discount
house
transactions
took
place
in
orange
county,
and
about
85%
took
place
in
los
angeles
county.
with
respect
to
the
complaining
dealers,
nine
of
them
--
nine
of
the
dealers
whose
salesman
complained
or
the
dealers
complained,
nine
were
in
los
angeles
county,
six
in
orange
county.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
where
is
orange
county?
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
well,
mr.
justice
clark,
it
comes
down
in
a
jagged
line
there.
i
--
it's
so
hard
to
tell
you
on
this
little
map,
we'll
print
you
a
larger
map.
it
runs
down
on
a
diagonal
line,
it
runs
down
to
sea
or
beach
area.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
new
port
is
in
orange
county
yes,
but
they
--
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
is
in
orange
county.
santa
ana,
anaheim,
city
of
orange,
well
the
place
is
up
there
where
those
several
--
those
five
discount
houses
are,
are
located
around
the
santa
ana,
orange,
garden
grove,
orrington
area.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
two
together
--
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
two
red
ones
together
that's
in
orange
county.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
well,
maybe
we're
not
looking
at
the
same
one
mr.
justice
clark.
the
--
if
you
start
over
at
the
right
hand
side,
there
are
one,
two,
three
in
a
kind
of
a
straight
line
perpendicular,
they're
in
orange
county.
then
there
are
two
together,
they're
in
orange
county,
no
more
in
orange
county.
all
the
rest
are
in
los
angeles
county.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
los
angeles
county,
yes
sir.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
there's
no
evidence
to
support
that
statement
of
the
government
at
all.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
you
can
not
ascertain
--
the
government
has
tried
to
ascertain
the
price
of
chevrolets
by
looking
at
the
dealer's
gross
profits,
the
dealer's
gross
profits
on
new
cars.
on
the
dealer
financial
statement
it's
separated.
so
you
can
tell
what
the
dealer's
gross
profit
is
every
gross
profit
for
new
cars.
discount
houses,
your
honor,
are
selling
to
the
public.
they
aren't
making
commercial
sales,
but
dealers
make
huge
numbers
of
commercial
sales.
so
you
really
can't
make
a
comparison
of
how
the
dealer
sells
to
the
public
and
they
should
think
out
the
commercial
sales,
because
those
commercial
sales
tend
to
drag
down
the
average
price
for
car.
you
see,
in
the
city
of
los
angeles,
there
are
tremendous
numbers
of
commercial
sales.
naturally,
in
that
vast
industrial
area
the
dealers
are
selling
people
like
(inaudible)
drive
yourself,
leasing
corporations,
los
angeles
police
department,
avis
rent-a-car
corporations
and
so
on
and
they
sell
with
respect
to
the
seven
dealers
studied
by
price
waterhouse
for
us,
they
sell
28%
of
their
cars
commercially.
so
if
you
add
those
in
at
very
little
mark
ups,
then
that
makes
it
look
as
though
the
los
angeles
dealers
are
selling
very
cheaply.
when
in
point
of
fact,
when
you
take
those
out
and
if
you
are
able
to
take
them
out
as
we
did
in
the
price
waterhouse
study,
you
may
well
find
that
the
los
angeles
county
or
city
dealers
are
selling
to
the
public
as
cheaply
or
even
cheaper,
i
mean,
that
the
orange
county
dealers
are
selling
to
the
public
as
cheap
or
cheaper
than
the
los
angeles
county
dealers.
the
figures
are
not
in
the
record
to
make
the
kind
of
an
argument
that
the
government's
making.
and
i
think
one
of
your
honors
asked
whether
we're
prejudiced
by
it
if
they
had
chosen
this
course,
you
know
we
went
through
this
twice
a
criminal
case
and
a
civil
case.
and
the
complaint
in
the
civil
case
is
identical
with
the
indictment
in
the
criminal
case.
and
never
did
they
talk
about
attacking
the
vertical
agreement
as
an
unreasonable
restraint.
they
refused
to
do
it.
if
such
a
thing
had
been
done,
we
could've
had
what
white
motors
said
to
require
an
economic
study
of
the
whole
thing
and
found
out
the
correct
answer
to
your
question,
but
it
isn't
in
the
record.
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
about
the
transaction,
perhaps
i
can
assist
you.
the
car
is
owned
by
the
dealer.
in
the
state
of
california,
only
the
dealer
can
transfer
title
to
the
car.
we
have
a
system
of
registration
by
the
state.
when
the
discount
house,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
referral
type
sale,
and
there
are
even
variations
of
this
but
a
typical
method
at
least
is
for
the
discount
house
to
have
an
arrangement
with
the
dealer
to
furnish
a
car
to
his
costumer.
and
the
--
he
gets
a
power
of
attorney
from
the
costumer
to
sign
the
contract
at
a
price
that
he
establishes.
this
price
is
over
and
above
what
the
dealer
is
wiling
to
let
go
of
the
car
for,
and
it
can
be
any
sum
of
money.
he
can
add
to
it
and
that's
why
not
all
these
discount
house
sales
were
so
cheap.
he
can
add
to
it
what
he
chooses.
the
dealer
signs
the
contract
to
the
costumer
for
the
total
price
which
includes
the
discount
house
fellow's
profit
and
the
discount
house
fellow
takes
that
contract
and
signs
on
behalf
of
the
costumer,
takes
it
to
the
finance
company
and
discounts
the
paper,
takes
the
money,
hands
it
to
the
dealer.
in
most
instances
of
this
kind,
he
handle,
he
the
discount
house
fellow,
handled
the
trade-in
car.
which
again,
it
makes
all
these
talk
about
what
the
discount
house
is
selling
for,
is
a
little
hard
to
find
out.
because
as
--
anybody
that's
bought
a
car
well
knows
the
seller
of
the
car
can
take
your
trade-in
car
in
under
its
real
value
and
pretend
to
give
you
a
great
bargain
by
selling
you
a
car
at
a
very
low
markup
and
all
of
a
sudden
really
the
real
transaction
is
not
a
bargain
at
all.
so
this
matter
of
talking
about
discount
house
bargains
can
not
be
done
in
a
breeze.
it
requires
a
careful
study
and
again
--
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
yes
he
can.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
the
dealer
can
do
the
same
thing
and
in
order
to
find
the
dealer's
price,
mr.
justice
clark,
the
true
price
you
must
make
a
careful
study
which
we
did
of
the
dealers
who
sold
through
discount
houses.
and
our
study
shows
that
the
dealers
who
sold
for
discount
houses
sold
directly
to
costumers
out
of
their
own
dealership
at
about
the
same
price
they
sold
through
discount
houses.
there's
no
real
profit
to
the
costumer
in
buying
through
discount
houses.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
yes
sir.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
no,
he's
really
the
agent
for
the
--
he's
the
agent
for
anybody.
he's
the
agent
for
the
dealer.
he
is
disposing
of
the
dealer's
cars
for
him.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
but
you
could
try
to
turn
it
upside
down,
i
suppose
if
you
want
to,
but
the
--
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
no,
i
mean
if
--
well
i
don't
mean
--
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
i
don't
mean
that
personally,
i
mean
it's
possible
to
argue
it
upside
down
but
the
reality
of
it
was
that
the
dealer
made
an
arrangement
with
the
discount
house
to
whereby
the
discount
house
would
dispose
of
the
dealer's
cars
for
him.
and
it
really
was
his
agent
or
broker.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
yes,
he
does.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
well,
the
franchise
agreement
contemplates
that
the
dealer
shall
have
a
place
of
business
agreed
upon.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
and
that's
for
--
not
for
any
competitive
purposes
but
for
competitive
purposes.
and
having
established
that
place
of
business,
he
shall
not
make
arrangements
for
another
place
of
business
without
the
consent
of
chevrolet.
so,
as
you
asked,
if
he
actually
puts
a
place
of
business
across
the
street
from
a
discount
house,
that
surely
is
a
violation
of
the
dealer
selling
agreement.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
nothing
in
the
franchise
agreement
prevents
that
but
--
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
i
think
we're
legally
entitled
to
do
so,
but
--
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
contrary
to
what
mr.
friedman
said,
yes.
of
course
it's
one
step
further
than
the
use
of
a
discount
house
as
a
sales
outlet.
you
have
the
transfer
of
title,
but
actually
--
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
well,
as
for
the
first
part
we
certainly
tried
to
stop
him
as
a
violation
of
the
agreement.
and
as
to
the
second
part,
there
were
no
sales
in
the
metropolitan
area
of
los
angeles,
two
discount
houses
for
resale.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
yes,
he's
more
and
some
instances,
the
one
that
i
was
describing
to
mr.
justice
fortas,
it's
more
like
a
broker
which
is
a
form
of
an
agent.
but
all
we
tried
in
this
case
mr.
justice
white
was
the
matter
of
sales
to
discount
house
outlets
or
sales
through
discount
house
outlets
used
by
dealers.
the
matter
of
selling
to
discount
houses
was
not
involved
in
los
angeles
and
it
has
some
aspects
that
need
to
be
studied
before
we,
you
know,
try
to
deal
with
it.
and
when
you
sell
to
a
discount
house,
it
kind
of
tends
to
become
a
--
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
well,
if
they
sold
it
to
a
discount
house
for
resale,
it
tends
to
become
a
used
car.
so
it's
quite
a
different
transaction
commercially
and
it
makes
quite
a
bit
of
difference
to
chevrolet.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
well
sure,
if
they
are
the
sale
to
someone
and
the
title
to
the
car
is
gone,
there's
no
obligation
on
the
dealer
to
worry
about
that
car
anymore.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
yes,
that
might
be
sir.
yes
it
might
be.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
i
didn't
understand
you.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
well,
it
might
under
these
circumstances.
the
thing
that
we're
objecting
to
about
discount
houses
is
not
for
discount
houses
because
dealers
are
discounter
also.
what
we're
objecting
to
is
another
place
of
business
at
which
cars
can
be
purchased,
because
by
putting
in
another
place
of
business
next
door
to
dealers,
23
or
something,
but
supposing
they
fully
operate
and
becomes
50
or
75
and
it
can
in
that
area.
you
put
in
other
places
of
business
and
you
cut
up
the
pie
so
that
somebody
is
not
going
to
survive
and
these
discount
houses
don't
have
much
of
an
operation
as
you
suggested.
and
so
the
people
who
are
not
going
to
survive
are
the
small
dealers
whose
--
who
provide
a
very
important
competitive
service
to
chevrolet
in
the
selling
of
cars.
and
so
there'll
be
a
lot
of
big
dealers
using
discount
houses
to
the
detriment
of
chevrolet's
ability
to
compete.
and
that
is
primary
affecting
them
so
far
as
standard
oil
company
employees
are
concerned,
if
they're
really
setting
up
a
place
of
business
there
where
cars
can
be
purchased,
yes
they
violate
the
location
clause.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
no,
but
if
they
advertised
cars
are
available
here
for
purchase,
you
know,
i'm
--
the
reason
i
don't
answer
your
question
directly
because
i
don't
what
those
standards
oil
dealer
or
service
station
men
are
going
to
do.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
i
don't
think
that
violates
the
location
clause.
i
think
you
have
to
have
and
the
way
we
have
construed
the
location
clause.
the
casual
sale
makes
no
difference.
a
so-called
bird
dog
which
is
a
kind
of
a
situation
you're
describing
perfectly
legitimate.
but
where
the
dealer
sets
up
an
arrangement,
a
regular
arrangement
where
the
place
of
business
which
advertises
chevrolets
for
sale,
as
the
discount
houses
did,
where
people
come
to
make
merchandising
transactions
of
a
wired
character,
sets
up
an
automobile
department
that's
another
place
of
business.
and
that
is
a
violation
of
the
dealer
selling
agreement.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
no,
there
was
some
exhibiting
of
cars
done,
but
some
do
--
i
can't
answer
the
question
directly
because
some
showed
cars.
most
of
them
didn't.
the
reason
that
chevrolet
has
this
plan
is
that
they
try
to
have
dealer
outlets
where
they
will
be
conveniently
available
for
the
servicing
of
automobiles
because
by
keeping
automobiles
in
good
order,
you
satisfy
the
costumers
and
they
come
back
again,
70%
of
the
chevrolet
costumers
are
repeat
costumers.
you
do
that
by
satisfying
them
and
the
dealer
does
that
at
convenient
location.
he
also
furnishes
the
factory
with
a
great
deal
of
information
which
by
reasonably
close
contact
with
costumers,
he's
able
to
do
which
enables
the
factory
to
prevent
fluctuations
in
their
schedule.
keeps
a
constant
employment,
keeps
the
costs
down,
a
very
important
competitive
factor
to
keep
the
cost
down.
and
then
at
the
same
time
it
provides
a
method
of
completely
pre-competition.
it's
really
the
minimal
restriction,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
or
obligation,
the
minimal
obligation
under
which
a
franchise
plan
can
operate.

that
if
the
dealer
were
himself
to
establish
another
outlet,
it
would
violate
the
dealer
selling
agreement
and
there
would
be
no
objection
on
his
part.
they
say
at
page
33,
“we
may
concede
arguendo
that
a
proliferation
of
branch
locations
may
impair
general
motors'
plans
basing
of
franchise
dealers,
as
it
contends,
by
depriving
some
individual
dealers
of
a
sufficient
profit
opportunity
for
them
to
bear
the
burdens
imposed
by
the
franchise
contract
in
regard
to,
for
example
servicing,
showroom
display,
inventory
and
periodic
reports.”
what
we
have
here
if
a
dealer
can't
himself
establish
an
outlet
but
can
simply
make
an
arrangement
of
the
discount
house
to
sell
his
cars
for
him,
however
you
characterize
the
legal
terms
of
the
transaction,
if
he
can
make
another
--
make
an
arrangement
with
another
place
whether
it's
a
discount
house
or
supermarket
or
what,
to
sell
a
dealer's
car
for
him,
the
dealer
has
got
another
business
location
to
which
he
sells
cars.
and
it's
just
as
destructive
and
as
--
if
i
have
time,
i
can
show
you
in
doing
the
brief,
it
is
more
destructive
of
the
chevrolet
franchise
plan
because
it
just
happens
that
these
concessionaires
and
discount
houses
have
no
ability
to
perform
the
competitive
operations
which
any
dealer-owned
outlet
would
have.
and
the
--
sir?
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
i
want
--
he
says
to
the
dealer,
“i
want
you
to
transfer
title
to
my
costumer.”
yes
if
he
is
--
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
yes,
but
if
he's
running
that
from
a
place
of
business
and
thereby
selling
cars
for
the
dealer
that
violates
the
location
clause.
but
if
he
takes
title
to
the
cars,
it
immediately
becomes
a
used
car
and
this
is
another
problem.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
stop
the
dealer
from
selling
cars
or
will
say
--
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
well
i
think
--
i
personally
think
so,
but
we
haven't
studied
that
problem
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
white.
we
have
quite
a
large
problem
with
this
one
situation.
and
that
presents
some
different
commercial
aspect
that
would
--
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
well,
it
does
in
the
sense
that
the
car
tends
to
become
a
used
car,
and
so
--
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
well,
we
do
not
stop
them
from
selling
cars
for
resale
used
or
otherwise,
i
mean
that
problem
was
not
involved
here
and
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
chevrolet
dealers
can
sell
at
any
price
they
want
to.
they
can
sell
wherever
they
want
to.
their
area
of
sales
responsibility
is
the
entire
area
metropolitan
area,
but
if
they
want
to
sell
in
san
diego
or
san
francisco
cars
to
people
there,
send
salesmen,
there
they
can
do
it.
there's
no
territorial
restriction
whatsoever.
there
is
no
restriction
whatsoever
on
to
whom
they
may
sell,
anybody
they
want
to,
any
costumer
they
can
find
at
any
price.
they
sell
at
discounted
prices
regularly
and
although
the
entire
85
dealers
were
not
studied,
those
selling
through
discount
houses
sold
at
the
same
price
to
their
regular
costumer
as
they
sold
them
through
the
discount
houses.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
what
is
it
sir?
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
no,
no.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
same
price.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
yes,
yes
dealers
--
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
--
sell
them
to
avis.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
another
terms
of
the
dealer
selling
agreement,
chevrolet
cannot
prevent
its
dealers
and
doesn't
attempt
to
from
selling
cars
to
avis.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
well
they
sell
to
avis
and
if
avis
wants
to
resale
them
under
the
terms
of
the
dealer
selling
agreement
that
can't
be
stopped.
that
apparently
doesn't
answer
your
question
that
they
can
--
there
is
no
restriction
on
to
whom
they
may
be
sold
or
for
what
purpose
for
that
matter
under
the
terms
of
the
dealer
selling
agreement.
you
asked
me,
second,
whether
that
could
be
stopped
by
amending
the
dealer
selling
agreement,
that's
a
subject
which
they
haven't
dealt
with.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
well,
when
avis
buys
the
car
and
takes
title,
any
sale
thereafter
becomes
a
used
car
sale.
therefore
--
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
why?
because
under
the
law,
at
least
of
the
state
of
california,
when
a
car
is
sold,
title
is
transferred
on
a
little
pink
slip
on
our
state
and
registered
in
the
state
of
california,
the
title
is
transferred
to
the
costumer,
avis.
and
avis
now
owns
the
car
and
it's
a
used
car
because
it
is
second
sale
and
he
can
not
retail
it
as
a
new
car.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
that's
one
reason
they
couldn't.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
that's
one
reason
they
could
not.
there
are
other
practical
reasons.
these
discount
house
operations
are
sort
of
shoestring
affairs
and
i
don't
know
that
it's
practical
for
them
to
do
that,
but
commercially
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
work.
and
therefore,
it
hasn't
of
recent
years
any
way
presented
a
problem.
and
it's
a
problem
that
we
didn't
have
to
face
here.
the
government
didn't
charge
us
with
restraining
sales
to
avis
for
resale
and
it's
something
that
we
didn't
try.
and
therefore,
when
all
its
commercial
effects
are
and
wherein
they
may
differ
from
this,
from
the
violation
of
the
present
provision,
i
can't
tell
you.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
oh
no!
no,
but
i
think
--
well,
i
think
the
commercial
aspects
affect
the
legal
position
of
the
parties
and
the
validity
of
the
restriction.
if
the
restriction
unreasonably
restrains
competition,
it's
invalid.
if
the
restriction
does
not
do
so,
it's
not
invalid.
and
i
think
the
commercial
aspects
of
a
transaction,
i
believe,
are
extremely
important
to
that
question.
that's
what
this
court
held
in
white
motor.
you
take
a
look
at
the
economic
and
business
stuff
of
--
out
of
which
the
restriction
arises.
i
think
it's
very
important.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
pardon
me?
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
well,
it
depends
on
what
we're
talking
about.
on
their
new
theory
that
the
vertical
--
the
contract
is
invalid,
they
don't
claim
that's
a
per
se
violation.
they
claim
that's
with
the
contract
by
restricting
dealers
from
having
--
from
using
discount
houses
or
other
places
of
business
for
second
outlet,
they
claim
that's
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade.
and
we
say
that
it's
not
an
unreasonable
restraint
because
it
would
destroy
the
franchise
system.
we
--
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
yes,
but
i
don't
exactly
see
what
you
mean.
we
had
evidence
of
the
way
the
transactions
took
place
you
mean,
and
other
transactions?
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
yes.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
yes.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
yes,
we
showed
that.
we
showed
that
the
result
of
dealers
using
these
extra
outlets
would
be
to
have
more
outlets
than
the
sales
potential
would
support
that
somebody
would
--
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
well,
we
put
this
in
not
to
fight
this
vertical
restriction
mr.
justice
white,
because
they
didn't
even
talk
about
this
in
the
trial
court.
this
is
--
we're
trying
this
for
the
first
time
in
this
high
court.
at
the
trial
court
level,
they
didn't
claim
that
the
contract
was
invalid.
they
said
that
the
contract
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
what
they
were
claiming
was
a
per
se
violation
which
they
call
a
boycott
because
we
enforced
our
contract
and
required
the
dealers
to
abide
by
it,
they
said
that
that
got
us
into
a
boycott.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
conspiracy
to
prevent
sale
through
discount
houses
which
they
characterized
as
a
boycott.
that
was
what
we
tried
at
the
trial
court
level
and
we
put
in
this
evidence
of
the
importance
of
the
location
clause
to
us
and
of
the
effect
that
it
would
have
if
dealers
were
allowed
to
use
these
extra
outlets.
and
now
they
would
run
the
small
dealers
out
of
business
and
we
showed
by
a
study
of
price
waterhouse
that
it
would
be
the
little
ones
that
would
first
have
to
cave
and
then
we
get
left
with
areas
in
this
vast
postal
claim
where
there
won't
be
any
dealers
having
service
facilities
or
providing
the
factory
with
information
to
hold
down
cost.
and
that
the
result
would
be
a
very
detrimental
to
general
motors.
and
we
put
in
that
evidence
because
we
were
not
just
sure
that
the
trial
judge
would
believe
the
--
mr.
roach
who
is
now
the
president
of
general
motors
but
who
is
at
the
time
of
the
transaction,
vice
president
in
charge
of
distribution.
he
said,
he
testified
that
general
motors
acted
not
to
help
out
the
dealers,
not
under
pressure
of
the
dealers.
now
general
--
what
general
motors
did
was
to
send
this
letter
to
every
general
motors
dealer
in
the
united
states,
pontiac,
cadillac,
volvo,
buick,
chevrolet
and
15
dealers
out
in
los
angeles
county,
15
dealers
didn't
pressure
general
motors
into
doing
this.
general
motors
did
this
because
it
believed
that
it
was
exceedingly
detrimental
to
its
franchise
system
that
was
going
on.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
that's
right.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
every
dealer
in
the
united
states,
that's
right.
and
not
under
pressure
of
15
complaining
dealers
out
there
in
los
angeles
at
all.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
no
sir,
they
did
not.
they
talked
to
them
and
pointed
out
what
they
were
doing
and
that
it
could
be
a
violation
of
the
franchise
agreement.
general
motors,
the
evidence
shows,
general
motors
values
its
dealers
very
highly.
these
are
very
important
people
and
they're
hard
to
come
by.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
yes,
i
hope
so.
i
hope
so.
and
so
they
just
don't
go
to
them
and
sue
them,
they
try
to
work
with
them
and
that's
what
they
did
here.
and
the
--
you
asked
whether
the
government
accepted
the
findings
in
this
case,
well
having
heard
the
testimony
of
mr.
roche
and
of
mr.
gordon,
who
was
then
president
and
had
something
to
do
with
the
sending
out
of
this
letter,
and
then
mr.
o'connor
who
had
to
do
with
effectuating
the
policy,
as
he
was
directed
to
do,
out
in
los
angeles.
having
heard
these
three
witnesses
testify
as
to
why
they
did
it,
which
was
nothing
to
do
with
any
pressure
for
many
dealers,
but
in
an
effort
to
carry
out
this
policy
of
general
motors
to
prevent
sales
not
by
discount
houses
particularly,
but
by
other
--
by
unauthorized
outlets.
and
thus
proliferates
a
number
of
outlets.
having
heard
that
testimony
and
understanding
perfectly
well
as
is
shown
by
an
excerpt
that
i
included
in
the
brief,
that
there
was
a
close
question
for
judge
carr
to
decide,
a
very
close
question
whether
general
motors
or
chevrolet
was
acting
jointly
with
the
dealers
or
was
acting
independently.
and
having
examined
that
question
which
he
understood
he
had
to
decide,
he
made
a
finding
that
general
motors
was
acting
independently.
we
considered
under
rule
52
(a)
not
the
function
of
this
court
to
try
to
retry
that
issue
of
fact,
because
it
is
an
issue
of
fact.
judge
carr
saw
the
witnesses.
he
heard
them.
he
examined
them
himself
and
the
question
of
whether
general
motors
acted
independently
or
in
some
kind
of
a
combination
or
a
conspiracy
with
the
dealers
is
a
question
which
a
finding
which
he
made.
and
the
government
must
attack
that
finding
to
prevail
on
the
conspiracy
issue.
so
far
as
price
competition
is
concerned,
they
make
a
great
deal
of
the
fact
that
the
--
of
their
claim
based
on
the
average
growth
profits
per
car.
they
make
a
great
deal
of
their
claim
that
the
costumer
could
purchase
for
less
through
a
discount
house.
actually
the
only
way
we
can
make
any
price
comparison
is
to
look
at
the
price
waterhouse
study,
because
that
is
the
only
study
which
compares
retail
prices
to
ordinary
costumers.
and
we
find
there
as
these
seven
dealers,
five
of
them
in
the
city
of
los
angeles,
one
in
glendale,
one
in
pasadena.
we
find
there
that
there
are
variances
in
the
prices
at
which
they
sell
to
their
regular
costumers.
a
citizen
chevrolet
located
up
there
in
eagle
rock,
which
chief
justice
i'm
sure
knows
where
it
is,
between
pasadena
and
glendale.
of
the
man
studied,
he's
the
low,
low
dealer.
and
remember,
these
men
are
all
selling
through
discount
houses,
out
of
what
is
supposedly
low
prices.
mr.
biggs
is
the
second
in
vermont,
he's
$54
higher
than
on
the
average
than
a
citizen.
so
that
there
is
a
spread
normally,
a
differentiation
of
--
differential
of
prices
normally
within
the
city
of
los
angeles
and
that
the
dealer
--
the
costumer
has
plenty
of
opportunity
to
get
a
price.
if
he
wants
to
--
if
he
lives
near
biggs
and
is
dissatisfied
because
biggs
is
higher,
then
two
miles
away
which
is
about
four
or
five
minutes
driving
in
los
angeles,
easy
driving,
he
is
over
at
courtesy
chevrolet
who
is
still
--
who
is
lower
than
biggs,
considerably
lower,
$28
lower.
or
he
can
go
over
to
brooder
on
hollywood
boulevard
which
is
about
six
minutes
away.
or
if
he
really
wants
to
get
the
low,
low
man
of
those
studied
up
at
eagle
rock,
this
is
about
six
miles
away,
12
to
15
minutes
and
here's
a
man
buying
a
car
on
the
order
of
$3000
which
he
buys
on
the
average
once
every
3
1/2
years,
so
he
has
plenty
of
opportunity
even
among
these
seven
dealers
to
--
and
in
an
easy
manner
to
find
a
better
price.
i'm
sure
that
the
--
if
the
entire
area
were
studied,
then
there
would
be
a
great
variation.
i
can't
whether
citizens
would
be
the
lowest
or
whether
biggs
would
be
the
highest,
perhaps
some
were
even
higher.
but
there
would
be
adequate
opportunity
within
the
los
angeles
area
for
the
costumer
to
find
a
price.
so
far
as
orange
county
is
concerned,
orange
county
is
--
you
can't
tell
when
you
go
from
los
angeles
county
to
orange
county
anymore,
it's
all
build
up.
and
if
there
are
not
dealers
in
orange
county,
we
don't
know
what
they
were
selling
their
retail
costumers
for.
but
if
by
any
chance
who
were
not
a
dealer
there
satisfactory
to
the
costumer,
it's
very
easy
to
drive
15
miles
in
the
los
angeles
metropolitan
area.
very
easy
indeed,
i
do
it
every
morning
and
every
night,
and
it
takes
no
time
at
all
to
get
to
dealers
within
the
15-mile
radius
of
the
average
dealer
in
the
los
angeles
metropolitan
area.
there
are
34
other
dealer
outlets
where
he
can
find
a
bargain,
34
opportunities.
it's
very
simple
matter
and
the
franchise
system
is
so
designed
as
to
enable
the
prospective
costumer
to
find
a
bargain.
no
dealer
sells
regularly
at
any
price.
every
transaction
is
a
new
bargain
and
every
costumer
in
the
area
has
an
adequate
opportunity
to
purchase,
and
actually,
the
discount
house
does
not
introduce
any
new
competition
in
the
area.
all
the
discount
house
does
is
to
provide
a
place
of
business
where
some
of
these
large
dealers,
most
of
them
rather
large
dealers
to
have
another
outlet
perhaps
near
some
smaller
dealer
at
which
to
do
business.
and
it's
not
just
a
matter
of
orange
county.
actually,
there
were
discount
house
outlets
near
these
larger
dealers
who
were
selling
through
discount
houses
supposedly
at
low
prices.
so
every
costumer
has
an
opportunity
to
purchase
at
a
low
price.
i
have
a
point
--
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
excuse
me?
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
there's
no
question
about
it.
the
--
there
is
a
psychology
and
there
was
testimony
about
this.
there
is
a
psychology
that
you
get
a
bargain
out
of
discount
house.
it's
perhaps
true
--
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
that's
why
he
got
another
outlet,
he
got
another
place
of
business
just
the
same
as
if
he
did
establish
it
himself,
he
got
another
outlet.
mr.
homer
i.
mitchell
well,
but
salesman
cruising
around,
mr.
justice
white,
don't
produce
that
psychology
that
drags
people
into
discount
houses
thinking
they
can
purchase
for
less.
they
don't
purchase
automobiles
for
less
but
they
must
purchase
some
other
merchandise
for
less
or
think
they
do.
and
actually
automobiles
are
sold
on
the
basis
of
contact,
so
the
witnesses
testify.
if
you
could
get
the
costumer
in
there,
you
could
probably
sell
him
the
--
any
dealer
ever
has
a
hand
on
it.
so
that's
the
--
that
was
what
was
happening
was
that
these
dealers
were
using
this
psychology
of
cut
rate
prices.
and
they
couldn't
use
that
psychology
by
having
a
--
sending
a
salesman
out,
so
they
were
really
sticking
an
outlet
in
the
discount
house.
that's
a
fact.
thank
you.
