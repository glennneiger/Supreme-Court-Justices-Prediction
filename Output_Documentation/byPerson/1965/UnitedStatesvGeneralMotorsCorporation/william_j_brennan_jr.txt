justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
any
servicing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
you
rely,
judge
hansen,
primarily
on
the
finding
that
there
was
no
conspiracy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
those
findings
were
not
acceptable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know,
clearly
erroneous,
but
suppose
on
the
premise
that
they
were
found
to
be
clearly
erroneous
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
would
then
the
association
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
adhere
on
the
government's
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
judge
hansen,
i
know
your
position
on
it.
i'm
asking
you
if
we
were
to
say
they
were,
would
the
association
then
be
here
in
the
context
the
government
insisted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
even
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
pardon,
just
one
last
thing,
mr.
friedman.
that
is
to
say
then
the
government's
position
is
that
you
may
have
relief
against
the
association
without
disturbing
any
findings
in
44.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
question
is
does
anything
have
to
be
done
the
finding
in
44
can
stand
and
yet
you
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
i
don't
follow,
yet
you
say
we
can
let
finding
44
stand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
prevail
under
conspiracy
aspect
of
your
case
if
we
don't
disturb
finding
44?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
finding
in
policing
in
42
does
you
no
good.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
upsetting
finding
44.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
you
got
to
upset
44
to
reach
the
association,
that's
the
short
of
it,
isn't
it?
