justice

are
you
asking
relief
against
the
association
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
but
you
--
yes
you
are
asking
relief
against
the
association?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
discount
house
was
just
a
stationary
salesman
for
the
dealer,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
mr.
friedman,
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
the
first
part
of
their
argument
that
just
the
ordinary
operation,
the
franchise
system,
you
don't
question
it
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
just
the
extra
arrangement
on
the
discount
houses.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
you
--
if
the
dealer
instead
of
working
precisely
the
way
he
did
through
the
discount
house,
has
leased
some
space
from
the
discount
house
and
put
his
own
man
out
there
to
manage
and
there
was
a
percentage
lease
arrangement
with
the
discount
house,
you
would
not
question
this
--
you
would
have
no
question
to
raise
here,
because
that
would
be
another
establishment,
an
open
additional
establishment.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
wouldn't
question
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
how
about
that
circumstance?
do
you
concede
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
leases
some
space
in
the
discount
house,
like
the
--
a
lot
shopping
centers
where
you
lease
some
space
and
you
put
your
own
man
out
there,
and
he
puts
up
some
signs
and
would
go
through
the
same
arrangement
except
there's
no
question
that
the
dealer
is
there.
he
has
some
space
and
he
has
an
employee
there,
a
salesman
making
sales.
and
the
arrangement
of
the
discount
house
is
a
percentage
lease.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
have
any
question
at
all
if
he
went
across
the
street
and
leased
a
--
some
lot
or
space
and
put
a
man
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
might
be
different
if
we
put
it
in
a
discount
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
establishment
of
somebody
else's
territory?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
isn't
traveling,
he's
stationary
salesman.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
friedman,
then
you
say
that
there's
no
way
they
could
stop
if
there
was
a
franchise
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
if
they
negotiated
a
new
franchise
agreement
and
said
that
you
may
not
sell
for
resale,
you
would
challenge
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
he
were
one
of
those
that
mr.
justice
fortas
suggests
mr.
mitchell,
what
then
under
your
franchise
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
discount
house
just
went
to
the
dealer
and
said,
“sell
me
ten
cars
a
month,
and
sell
them
to
me.
i'll
take
the
responsibility
for
them,”
then
he
gets
--
resold
them,
is
there
something
in
your
franchise
agreement
to
prevent
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
prevent
it?
i
mean
would
you
be
legally
entitled
to
do
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
contrary
to
what
mr.
friedman
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
on
the
antitrust
laws
down
here,
it
shouldn't
make
much
difference
to
you
whether
this
fellow
was
an
independent
contractor,
an
agent
or
anything
else.
i
mean,
if
he's
an
agent
of
the
dealer,
you
can
stop
him
under
your
franchise
agreement
if
you
--
if
it
isn't
within
your
franchise
agreement,
you
can
unilaterally
stop
him
any
way
if
you
can
persuade
him
without
violating
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
yes,
but
as
mr.
justice
fortas
suggest
you've
got
sort
of
at
least
a
mixed
transaction
here
whether
discount
house
actually
assumes
some
risk
in
the
matter
and
does
a
little
bit
more
than
just
selling
like
an
ordinary
salesman
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
some
judge
somewhere
might
think
that
what
actually
is
going
on
there
is
pretty
much
like
it
as
if
they
actually
sold
it
through
discount
houses.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
suppose
i'm
not
in
the
business
of
renting
cars
like
cars
for
someone.
so
having
this
independent
and
i
started
business
in
los
angeles
renting
cars
and
i
need
ten
chevrolets
a
month
that
i
buy
from
one
of
the
gm
dealers,
and
i
pay
them
cash
for
the
cars
and
at
least
a
month.
one
time
i
say,
“instead
of
selling
me
ten
cars
and
let's
--
sell
me
20,
the
same
price.
i've
been
getting
a
pretty
good
price
for.”
and
the
chevrolet
dealer
says,
“well
what
do
you
need
it
for?”
“well,
i'm
going
to
resell
them
with
a
little
profit
over
the
point
price
you
sell
them
to
me.
and
all
i
want
you
to
do
is
just
deliver
the
cars
to
me.
i'll
give
you
a
note
for
them.
i
pay
you
cash
for
them
on
the
barrel
avenue,
deliver
them
to
my
establishment.
and
the
only
thing
is
i
want
you
to
transfer
title
directly
to
any
costumer
that
i've
got.”
now,
would
that
be
--
that
kind
of
an
arrangement
be
another
establishment
of
yours?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
--
but
he
says,
“i
will
already
have
paid
you
for
them,
you
already
have
the
cash
in
your
pockets.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
that
you
could
stop
him
under
your
present
franchise
agreement
from
doing
that
and
do
it
legally,
but
you
also
say
that
you,
general
motors,
could
come
around
to
your
dealer
and
say,
“by
the
way,
we
know
we
can't
stop
you
under
our
present
franchise
agreement,
let's
sign
up
a
new
one
that
says
that
you
will
stop
and
you'll
never
do
it
again.”
and
your
dealer
who
doesn't
want
to
get
in
trouble
with
you,
signs
that
agreement,
now
you
would
say
you
could
do
that
too,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
dealer
sit
down
say
a
new
agreement
to
say
and
the
dealer
promises
faithfully
he
will
never
sell
in
that
manner
again.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
not
sure
it
becomes
any
different
problem
than
what
you
have
before
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
what
i
thought.
i'm
leasing
cars
and
i
find
that
i
can
sell
new
cars
to
my
costumers
and
have
a
little
--
and
they'll
pay
a
little
bit
more
than
i
paid
for
whether
they're
used
or
not.
well
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
in
your
view
--
excuse
me
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
your
view,
this
really
wasn't
of
--
the
effectiveness
of
this
arrangement
wasn't
price
at
all.
it
was
just
what
people
thought
their
price
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
advantage
of
it
was
so
that
either
was
using
it
was
that
he
didn't
sell
it
in
a
lower
price,
he
was
just
getting
more
value.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
just
likely
his
salesman
that
were
cruising
around
in
those
other
areas
where
he
is
specially
affected.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
friedman
says
the
government
is
still
seeking
relief
against
the
association.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
it's
included
in
the
idea
that
each
of
the
dealers
in
los
angeles
conspired
with
general
motors
if
we're
suddenly
shown
that
the
way
they
did
it
was
through
their
association?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so
and
that
may
be
the
record,
that
may
be
what
the
record
is
but
that's
a
little
bit
different
from
saying
they're
not
entitled
to
urge
it
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suggest
they're
urging
it
by
saying
that
all
of
the
dealers
have
conspired
with
general
motors.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
may
be
the
record
--
justice
byron
r.
white
may
be
the
record
doesn't
sustain
their
contention
if
you
suggest,
but
you
think
they're
even
entitled
to
have
us
consider
it
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
friedman,
just
one
question.
did
you
say
that
you
could
--
you
thought
you
could
get
relief
against
the
association
even
though
you
convinced
this
court
only
on
the
--
not
on
the
conspiracy
in
the
end
of
your
case,
but
on
the
franchise
agreement
end.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
conspiracy
case
has
to
stand
before
you
reach
the
association.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
my
--
what
it
confused
me
--
