mr.
bender,
i
think
so
far
as
i'm
concern,
remember
what
i'm
interested
in
is
a
question
that's
capable
i
think,
a
very
simple
answer
here?
is
it
the
position
of
the
government
that
you
would
not
oppose
action
by
this
court
which
will
necessarily
and
certainly
and
not
debatably
result
in
assuring
this
right
of
appeal?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean,
we
may
have
put
it
in.
justice
abe
fortas
right.
