mr.
denlinger,
may
i
ask
you?
you
and
the
government
agree
that
the
motion
for
bail
maybe
treated
as
an
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
do
we
go
into
all
of
these?
why
don't
we
just
send
it
back
and
tell
the
court
of
appeals
to
adhere
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
suggestion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then,
we're
talking
about
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
well,
i
gather
if
that's
right,
if
that
motion
for
bail
is
to
be
treated
as
a
notice
of
appeal
and
we
don't
have
to
get
into
all
of
those
business
of
--
about
the
motion
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
both
of
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
i
find
--
i
frankly
don't
follow,
if
the
motion
for
a
bail
bond
is
a
notice
of
appeal
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
then
how
can
it
be
sound?
if
it
is
a
notice
of
appeal,
you
are
in
time,
you're
entitled
to
argue
on
the
merits,
period,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
that
it
was
really
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
if
there's
an
analogy,
i
thought
frequently
you
get
a
petition
for
(inaudible)
that
we
treated
as
petition
for
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
of
course
we
haven't
quite
decided
that.
