the
government
doesn't
quite
conceded
a
way,
do
they?
justice
potter
stewart
that
they're
--
they
--
as
i
read
it,
they
choose
their
language
rather
carefully
and
they
say
this
court
might
properly
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
reached
that
conclusion,
they
don't
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
that
is
the
conclusion
that
they
reached,
they
don't
really
urge
that
one.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
including
--
they
even
have
a
footnote?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
equally
clear
that
the
application
for
bond
was
not
denominated
or
intended
by
the
--
by
your
--
by
the
petitioner
as
another
scope
here,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
didn't
have
--
it's
also
clear
that
it
didn't
contain
most
of
what
is
required
to
be
in
it,
in
the
notice
of
appeal
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
amount
to
a
confession
of
error
or
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you've
taken
--
justice
potter
stewart
you've
taken
this
point
one
little
baby
step
by
a
time?
you
asked
us
first
to
remand
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
let
them
consider
whether
or
not
this
application
for
bond
was
a
notice
of
appeal
without
any
indication
that
you
wouldn't
oppose
any
such
construction
of
it
there.
and
now
the
--
here
in
your
brief
you
say,
“with
--
the
court
might
do
it”,
and
now
in
your
oral
arguments
you're
saying
a
little
bit
more.
now
i
wondered
if
eventually
you're
going
to
end
up
with
a
confession
of
error.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
how
long?
justice
potter
stewart
you
couldn't?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
you
filed
that
--
you
filed
that
motion
after
their
petition
for
certiorari
had
been
granted
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
the
case
had
been
set
for
argument,
then
you
came
in
and
asked
us
to
remand
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
without
making
any
clear
--
without
making
clear
analogy,
we
wouldn't
oppose
that
construction
on
the
paper
down
to
the
court
of
appeals.
