mr.
paul
bender
you
will
not
take
--
mr.
paul
bender
--
till
lunch
break.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
--
mr.
paul
bender
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
first
to
the
suggestion
that
the
court
need
not
reach
the
question
of
the
effect
of
an
untimely
motion
for
new
trial
in
this
case
because
in
the
filing,
within
the
10-day
period
of
a
motion
for
bail
which
does
amount
to
a
notice
of
appeal.
it
is
argued
that
the
court
might
and
should
find
that
in
--
consistently
with
the
spirit
of
the
rules
that
this
document
which
is
on
page
10
of
the
record
does
amount
to
a
notice
of
appeal.
the
document
recites
that
the
defendant
comes
in
person
and
moves
the
court
to
fix
a
reasonable
bail,
pending
a
final
determination,
an
appeal
for
final
adjudication
in
this
action.
now,
the
document
doesn't
contain
several
of
the
required
elements
of
a
notice
of
appeal
as
set
out
by
the
rules.
but
it
does
contain
we
believe
the
one
significant
essential
element
and
that
is
declaration
in
writing,
in
a
writing
filed
with
the
court
of
the
intention
to
appeal.
the
other
elements
such
as
the
settings,
and
the
place
of
confinement,
and
the
name
of
the
case
and
the
name
of
the
lawyer,
name
of
the
lawyer
was
in
this
one,
do
not
at
all
affect
the
substance
of
the
motion.
those
are
obviously
understood
by
the
government
and
the
case
and
by
the
law
--
by
the
court.
the
essential
element
of
a
notice
of
appeal
we
believe
is
the
declaration
of
an
intention
to
appeal
within
the
10-day
period,
and
that
was
clearly
done
in
this
case.
the
lower
courts
have,
on
numerous
occasions,
treated
documents
which
don't
amount
to
notices
of
appeal
as
formerly
amounting
notices
of
appeal
--
as
notices
of
appeal,
because
they
have
contained
that
single
element
of
a
declaration
of
an
intention
to
appeal,
letters,
informal
letters
written
to
the
court
or
to
the
clerk
by
prisoners
have
been
deemed
to
be
notices
of
appeal.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
in
the
brief,
we
say
the
court
might
on
full
consideration
receive
really
no
reason
why
the
court
should
not
call
this
to
be
a
notice
of
appeal.
we
can't
see
any
prejudice
which
would
occur
to
the
government,
to
the
--
to
defendants
or
to
the
fair
administration
of
the
system
if
these
were
deemed
to
be
a
notice
of
appeal.
on
the
other
hand,
we
think
it
is
a
little
inconsistent
with
that
--
with
the
rules
to
demand
all
the
precise
requisites
of
a
notice
of
appeal
as
set
out
in
the
rules.
and
we
do
note
that
the
new
rules
cut
down
on
those
required
elements
a
little
bit
which
seems
to
be
consistent.
some
of
the
--
the
new
rules
require
that
the
notice
of
appeals
--
of
appeals
should
specify
the
party
taking
the
appeal,
the
judgment
order
apart
thereof
appealed
from,
and
shall
name
the
court
to
which
the
appeal
is
taken.
it
doesn't
require
the
place
of
confinement,
for
example,
of
the
address
of
the
lawyer.
the
only
conceivable
part
of
that
i
should
think
which
should
be
required
in
a
notice
of
appeal
is
the
judgment
order
apart
thereof
appealed
from.
but
there's
no
question
in
this
case
as
to
what
that
was.
there
was
only
one
judgment
if
it
was
the
judgment
of
conviction.
and
i
can't
really
imagine
that
they
could
have
been,
in
the
case
like
this,
any
ambiguity
about
what
he
was
appealing
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
to
say
it's
a
confession
of
error
on
--
would
indicate
that
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
made
an
error.
i'm
not
sure
we
can
say
that
because
i'm
not
sure
this
was
called
to
the
intention
of
the
court
of
appeals.
for
example,
it
wasn't
called
to
our
attention
until
the
record
was
sent
up
to
this
court
after
the
petition
for
certiorari
had
been
granted.
at
the
time
the
petition
was
filed
and
granted,
this
document
was
not
in
the
records
sent
up
to
the
court.
we
don't
know
whether
this
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals,
so
far
as
we
can
tell
it
was.
in
those
circumstances,
we
--
it
doesn't
seem
seemly
the
call
it
a
confession
of
error
--
mr.
paul
bender
--
in
the
court
below.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
it
doesn't
bother
me
to
call
it
a
confession
or
i
just
didn't
want
to
suggest
--
mr.
paul
bender
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
done
anything
wrong.
one
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
think
we
suggested
in
the
first
document
filed
that
we
would
oppose
this
construction
of
the
court
below.
we
did
suggest
that
--
mr.
paul
bender
we
did
suggest
at
that
stage
if
the
court
might
remand
it
to
the
court
below
because
it
seemed
the
question
which
could
appropriately
be
considered
by
them
in
the
first
place
since
it
amounted
to
the
interpretation
of
the
document.
the
court
however
granted
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
set
the
case
for
argument.
in
those
circumstances,
we
see
no
reason
why
this
court
itself
can't
construe
the
document.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
suppose
we
didn't
make
it
clear.
we
would
not
oppose.
we
didn't
suggest
that
we
would.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
true.
we
would
not
oppose
that.
mr.
paul
bender
that
is
--
mr.
paul
bender
that
is
our
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
we
do
not
oppose
the
remand
over
this
case.
mr.
paul
bender
it
seems
we
think
it
is
a
sensible
course
of
action
for
the
court
to
take.
we
think
the
alternative
would
be
to
insist
that
all
the
minutiae
of
a
notice
of
appeal
or
to
invent
now
some
rule
about
how
many
of
the
elements
of
a
notice
of
appeal
has
to
be
present,
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
sensible
course
to
take.
the
important
thing
it
seems
to
us
is
that
within
the
10-day
period,
the
defendant
state,
in
writing
to
the
court
or
to
a
document
which
will
reach
the
court
or
the
government
or
both,
that
he
intends
to
appeal
and
this
defendant
did
that.
now,
he
didn't
intend
it
to
be
a
notice
of
appeal,
that's
true,
but
that
doesn't
again
seem
to
make
any
difference.
he
did
--
mr.
paul
bender
excuse
me?
mr.
paul
bender
our
position?
mr.
paul
bender
no,
i
don't
think
so
justice
white.
it
is
a
--
mr.
paul
bender
no,
because
you
have
a
line
of
decisions
in
the
lower
court
stretching
over
the
course
of
the
years
holding
that
similar
documents
do
amount
to
notices
of
appeal,
including
one
case,
the
o'neal
case.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
it's
not
as
though
we
were
inventing
it
in
this
court
now
--
mr.
paul
bender
--
for
the
first
time.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
except
this
is
not
--
this
isn't
even
a
petition
addressed
to
the
court
which
is
going
to
give
the
relief.
this
is
a
purely
formal
notice
which
you
file
in
the
district
court.
and
the
whole
purpose
of
which
is
to
signify
your
intention
to
appeal
and
the
people
who
--
mr.
paul
bender
no,
not
--
not
just
the
motion
for
bail.
it
would
have
to
be
motion
for
bail
pending
appeal.
mr.
paul
bender
this
is
--
yes,
motion
for
bail
pending
appeal.
that
to
us
justice
clark
is
the
line.
you
got
to
show
an
intention
to
take
the
errors
in
the
judgment
to
a
higher
court.
if
you
merely
show
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
if
it
were
solely
a
motion
for
bail
pending
determination
of
the
motion
for
new
trial
and
said
nothing
about
an
intended
appeal,
we
would
urge
that
that
was
not
a
notice
of
appeal.
you
got
to
draw
some
kind
of
line
and
the
sensible
line
seems
to
us
to
be
a
signification
of
intention
to
go
to
the
appellate
court
and
a
motion
for
bail
pending
appeal
in
this
case
as
in
the
o'neal
case,
a
bond,
an
appeal
bond
actually
filed
with
the
court,
should
it
seems
to
us
be
held
to
be
a
proper
substantial
notice
of
appeal.
in
those
circumstances,
we
think
that
there
is
notification
for
the
court
to
resolve
the
question
on
which
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
effect
of
an
untimely
motion
for
new
trial
on
the
running
of
the
time
to
appeal.
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
the
case
on
october
--
on
october
25th
of
last
year.
mr.
paul
bender
four
months
after
that
time,
the
court
on
february
28th
of
this
year,
the
court
promulgated
rules
which
were
going
to
effect
on
july
1st
of
this
year
which
make
it
clear
behind
any
doubt
that
an
untimely
motion
for
new
trial
has
no
effect
upon
the
running
of
the
time
to
appeal.
this
question
indeed
was
before
the
court
in
1961
in
lott
against
united
states
and
the
court
didn't
decide
it
there
but
noticed
the
question,
noticed
some
difficulty
in
it,
and
suggested
that
the
question
should
be
resolved
not
judicially
but
in
the
course
of
judicial
decision
but
by
the
rule-making
process.
that's
precisely
what
has
been
done.
it
has
been
resolved
by
the
rule-making
process
consistently
with
the
position
which
five
of
the
six
courts
of
appeals
have
taken
under
the
1946
rule
that
is
an
untimely
motion
has
no
effect.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
see
why.
government
has
no
right
to
equal
protection,
i
would
think.
mr.
paul
bender
for
the
--
in
favor
--
running
in
favor
of
the
government?
mr.
paul
bender
i
suggest
you
to
not
reach
that
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think,
as
the
court
said
in
lott,
the
question
should
be
decided
by
the
rule-making
process
had
now
has
been
decided
by
the
rule-making
process
and
there
seemed
no
reason
to
overturn
the
steady
course
of
decision
except
in
one
circuit,
that
is
the
tenth
circuit,
that
an
untimely
notice
of
appeal
has
no
effect
upon
the
running
of
the
time
for
appeal
and
that
sends
this
case
as
a
fortiori
from
lott
that
the
court
shouldn't
reach
the
issue.
and
indeed,
we
--
as
we've
said,
there's
no
need
to
reach
the
issue
in
this
case
because
there
was
a
timely
motion.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
white
because
i
don't
think
you're
upsetting
a
rule
to
deem
the
motion
for
bail
to
be
a
notice
of
appeal.
in
fact,
if
you
were
to
hold
--
mr.
paul
bender
that's
right.
it
doesn't
contain
what
the
rule
says,
it
must
contain
but
we
know
from
rule
52
which
petitioner
has
cited
that
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
but
you
see,
you
would
be
upsetting
more
if
you
held
the
other
way.
mr.
paul
bender
because
if
you
--
mr.
paul
bender
--
insisted
that
a
notice
of
appeal
--
mr.
paul
bender
--
contained
all
the
elements,
you'd
be
upsetting
this
whole
line
of
cases
which
we
cite
in
the
brief.
mr.
paul
bender
including
this
court's
decision
in
the
--
this
court's
notation
in
the
coppedge
case
that
we've
been
very
liberal
with
regard
to
what
amounts
to
a
notice
of
appeal.
you'd
have
to
upset
that
also
whereas
viewing
it
as
a
notice
of
appeal
as
wholly
consistent
with
the
court's
decisions
and
it
doesn't
lead
you
to
inquiring
to
whether
you
should
upset
this
other
policy,
namely
--
mr.
paul
bender
to
do
what?
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
perhaps
you
would.
i
think
if
--
it's
most
consistent
of
rule
2
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
should
think
so,
right,
i
think
it's
most
consistent
with
the
rule
2
to
view
this
a
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
we
don't
want
you
to
move
forward
the
date
of
the
new
rules.
we
think
that
the
--
the
provision
in
the
new
rules
that
an
untimely
notice
of
appeal
has
no
effect
has
been
the
rule,
is
indeed
it
has
been
in
five
of
the
six
circuits,
which
have
considered
it
since
1946.
it
was
the
rule
before
1946
without
any
doubt
exclusively
and
it's
the
only
rule
that
makes
any
sense
because
if
you
held
that
an
untimely
motion
for
a
new
trial
tolled
the
time
for
appeal,
then
you
would
have
a
rule
which
said
that
a
--
only
frivolous
document
of
argument
didn't
make,
didn't
have
any
impact,
would
have
an
impact
for
the
purpose
of
extending
the
time
to
appeal.
this
is
contrary
to
the
motion
which
this
court
has
repeated
many
times
that
you
can't
enlarge
times
to
appeal
by
taking
frivolous
useless
steps
below
and
that's
what
you
do
here
if
you
filed
an
untimely
motion
for
new
trial.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
one
last
intention
with
regard
to
that
issue
which
we
don't
think
you
ought
to
reach.
and
that
is
the
suggestion
that
in
some
way
defendants
would
be
prejudiced
by
their
reliance
on
the
plain
words
of
the
rule
by
filing
an
untimely
motion
for
new
trial
and
then
assuming
that
they
would
get
10
days
from
the
denial
of
that
time
to
appeal.
it
seems
that
you
--
defendant
can
properly
rely
upon
the
words
of
the
rules
because
if
he
read
the
rules,
he
knows
that
the
motion
for
new
trial
is
untimely
when
he
files
it
on
the
ninth
day.
the
only
way
he
could
fail
to
know
that
is
that
he
only
read
the
rules
about
time
to
appeal
and
didn't
bring
the
rule
about
the
motion
for
new
trial
which
seems
to
be
unlikely.
so
if
he
reads
the
rules,
he
knows
that
on
the
ninth
day
when
he
files
his
motion
for
new
trial
that's
untimely.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
he
can
honestly
think
that
that
is
going
to
prolong
his
time
to
do
anything
else
because
that
itself
is
an
untimely
act.
secondly,
there's
no
reliance
in
this
case
upon
any
court
decisions
construing
the
rule
because
the
sixth
circuit
which
is
where
this
case
wrote
had
a
decision
squarely
in
point
holding
that
an
untimely
note
--
motion
for
new
trial
does
not
extend
the
time
to
appeal.
and
thirdly,
there
isn't
any
reliance
in
this
case
such
as
you
had
in
the
harris
case
or
the
thompson
case
arising
under
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
where
the
court
held
where
a
defendant
relies
upon
an
affirmative
act
of
the
district
court
or
the
government
taken
within
the
initial
time
to
appeal
and
doesn't
file
his
appeal
because
that
act
signifies
to
him
that
he
has
more
time
than
he
shouldn't
be
prejudiced
by
that
reliance.
but
in
this
case,
there's
no
such
reliance.
the
district
court
did
nothing
during
a
10-day
period
to
suggest
to
the
defendant
that
he
would
not
have
more
time
nor
did
the
government
do
anything
within
the
10-day
period.
so,
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
that
there
is
in
any
sense
any
reliance
here,
and
indeed
there
couldn't
be
any
reliance
in
any
case
unless
there
had
been
such
an
affirmative
act.
for
those
reasons
we
think
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
that
an
untimely
motion
for
new
trial
does
not
extend
the
time
if
it
was
correct.
but
we
believe
that
there
was
a
timely
notice
of
appeal
in
this
case
that
is
the
motion
for
bond
on
page

of
the
record
and
that
the
appropriate
course
would
be
to
vacate
the
decision
below
and
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals,
to
hear
the
appeal
on
the
merits.
