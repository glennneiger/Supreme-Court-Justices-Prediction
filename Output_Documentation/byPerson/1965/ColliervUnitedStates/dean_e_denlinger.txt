e.
denlinger
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arose
upon
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner,
mr.
collier,
for
violation
of
the
white-slave
act.
he
attempted
to
appeal
his
conviction
to
the
sixth
circuit.
that
circuit
dismissed
his
appeal
as
untimely.
it
is
from
that
decision,
that
ruling
of
the
sixth
circuit
that
we
are
here.
there
are
two
independent
alternative
grounds
for
reversing
that
decision.
the
first
of
this
is
that
the
notice
of
appeal
which
was
so
labeled
was
in
fact
filed
within
time.
the
second
ground
was
first
urged
by
the
government
itself
in
his
brief
filed
last
week
and
that
ground
is
this.
that
clearly
within
time,
a
motion
for
bail
was
filed.
this
motion
for
bail
in
the
government's
view
and
in
ours
did
constitute
a
notice
of
appeal.
the
facts
are
these.
the
conviction
was
on
march
24,
a
year
ago.
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
made
on
april
2nd,
nine
days
later.
three
days
after
that,
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
for
new
trial.
seven
days
after
that,
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
filed
a
paper
denominated
notice
of
appeal.
the
rule
involved
is
the
rule
37
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
that
rule
states
and
with
the
court's
permission
i'd
like
to
read
just
a
few
lines
of
that
in
plain
and
in
unambiguous
terms,
the
following.
an
appeal
by
a
defendant
may
be
taken
within
10
days
after
entry
of
the
judgment
or
order
appealed
from,
but
if
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
or
in
arrest
of
judgment
has
been
made
within
the
10-day
period,
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
or
conviction
may
be
taken
within
10
days
after
entry
of
the
order
denying
the
motion.
in
this
case,
the
lawyer
then
appearing
for
the
petitioner
literally
and
very
plainly
complied
with
that
rule
as
written.
within
10
days,
specifically
on
the
ninth
day,
he
did
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
it's
on
page
11.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
and
then,
appearing
on
page
13
is
the
denial
of
that
motion
which
followed
within
three
days.
within
seven
days
of
that
denial,
that
when
--
again
fairly
within
the
literal
reading
of
the
rule,
then
counsel
for
petitioner
filed
a
notice
of
appeal.
the
reason
given
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
finding
that
this
--
that
those
appeal
was
untimely
is
simply
this.
the
rule
33,
under
the
rule,
says
motions
for
new
trial
must
be
filed
within
five
days
after
verdict.
the
verdict
was
also
on
march
24th,
the
same
day
as
the
sentence.
hence,
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
untimely
under
rule
33.
i
might
add
that
the
motion
for
new
trial
was
not
on
grounds
when
we
discovered
evidence.
and
for
that
reason,
the
court
could
not
grant
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
the
court
did
not
give
its
reasons
for
denial
at
the
time
that
it
denied
the
motion,
it
simply
said,
"the
motion
is
denied."
the
court
of
appeals,
in
agreement
with
some
other
courts
of
appeals,
held
that
where
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
filed
even
though
within
the
10
days,
specifically
provided
for,
in
rule
37,
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
does
not
in
effect
toll
the
operation
of
10-day
period
and
does
not
commence
a
new
10-day
period
within
which
appeal
upon
that
--
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
yes,
sir.
i
believe.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
we'd
be
very
please
to
do
so
if
the
court
agrees
with
both
the
government
and
with
myself.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
the
suggestion
was
that
since
the
government
on
this
newly
discovered
ground,
very
newest
ground,
feels
that
the
case
should
be
sent
back
and
if
i
agree
on
that
ground,
yes
i
do,
why
not
simply
sent
it
back?
and
my
answer
was,
i'd
be
very
glad
to
do
so
if
the
court
concurs
in
our
agreement.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
he
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
if
this
court
concurs
in
the
position
of
both
government
and
myself,
i
should
be
very
happy
to
have
the
case
remanded
and
the
prior
judgment
vacated.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
exactly.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
that's
correct.
i
accept
the
government's
intention
on
the
newly
various
point.
and
--
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
no.
they
don't
confess
error
and
while
they
may
not
urge
it,
at
least
they
endorsed
holding
of
motion
for
bail
to
be
a
notice
of
--
a
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
yes
sir.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
yes.
i
find
myself
in
a
somewhat
unusual
position
that's
written
somewhat
instead
of
the
law
review,
that
particular
section
of
the
brief.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
yes.
well,
i
do
think
that
both
are
--
both
grounds
are
good
solid
support
for
reversal
and
with
that
--
in
any
way,
detracting
from
the
soundness
of
the
point
urged
by
the
government.
i
think
that
the
original
ground
urged
in
my
brief
is
even
sounder.
and
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
that's
correct.
clearly
was
not
intended
to
be
a
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
yes.
six
of
the
elements
as
the
government
so
points
out
required
to
be
contained
or
not
present.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
the
problem
of
timeliness
has
been,
the
question
nearly
raised
has
not
been,
except
to
this
extent,
that
new
rules
do
not
require
nearly
as
many
elements
to
be
contained
in
a
notice
of
appeal.
it's
still
to
be
--
be
active
either
(inaudible)
i
would
like
to
add
since
we're
talking
about
the
ground
urged
by
the
government.
one
authority
that
the
government
does
not
cite,
that
is
rule
52
or
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
rule
52
says
that
if
there
is
a
defect,
error
or
irregularity
which
does
not
affect
substantial
rights,
such
defect
is
to
be
disregarded.
now,
i
think
this
is
clearly
applies
to
the
elements
missing
from
the
notice
of
appeal
and
reinforces
the
arguments
and
authorities
urged
by
the
government.
returning
into
the
first
ground,
the
rule
as
i
said
it
previously,
is
plainly
written,
is
i
believe
exceptionally
and
ambiguous,
and
was
literally
complied
with
by
counsel.
this
i
feel
should
be
enough.
however
to
go
further,
the
history
of
the
motion
indicates
that
the
draftsman
of
the
rule,
the
predecessor
rules,
knew
how
to
say
timely
or
seasonable.
this
was
found
in
the
rule
3
of
the
prior
rules
that
the
draftsman
engaged
in
drafting
the
current
rules,
those
about
to
be
superseded,
also
knew
how
to
say
timely
for
--
they
did
so
in
the
first
draft.
and
if
that
the
draftsman
of
the
rules
which
now
superseded
knew
how
to
say
timely,
there
would
have
been
no
problem
when
they're
saying
so.
the
government
in
its
brief
points
out
that
there
was
an
intermediate
draft
of
present
rule
37
(a)
(2)
which
is
worded
somewhat
differently
than
the
first
draft.
however
in
both
cases,
the
draftsman
of
the
rule
clearly
knew
how
to
say
timely
and
clearly,
this
requirement
was
eliminated
from
the
rule
which
was
put
into
effect.
now,
not
only
is
a
rule
plain,
its
history,
now
it
supports
it.
the
policy
set
forth
in
the
rules
themselves
and
clearly
divided
in
decision
of
this
court
supports
a
liberal
reading
of
the
timeliness
provisions
as
well
as
the
provisions
laying
the
form.
this
policy
runs
through
decisions
of
this
court,
both
with
respect
to
form
of
notice
of
appeal
and
timeliness.
the
government
i
feel
appropriately
follows
this
policy
in
urging
that
formalities
we
overlooked
in
finding
that
the
motion
for
bail
was
adequate
notice
of
appeal.
it
does
not,
i
feel,
give
appropriate
attention
to
that
policy
in
its
urging
that
a
notice
of
appeal
so
dominated
was
filed
on
time.
this
policy
is
contained
first
of
all
in
rule
2
of
the
rules
themselves.
rule
2
says
that
the
rules
are
to
be
interpreted
to
deal
simplicity,
to
deal
fairness,
and
expeditious
proceedings.
to
be
fair,
certainly
includes
not
misleading
the
counsel
in
understanding
the
rule.
the
attorney
who
filed
this
notice
of
appeal
did
as
i
say
precisely
the
following.
it
could
hardly
be
considered
fair
to
have
this
counsel
--
to
have
this
petitioner
find
himself
out
of
court
after
such
a
clear
compliance
with
the
letter
and
the
rules
themselves.
it
certainly
is
not
conducive
to
simplicity
to
have
such
an
unneeded
and
somewhat
unexpected
complication
imported
into
the
rule
itself,
a
complication
being
that
on
a
timely
motion
tolls
the
running
of
the
10-day
period
allows
dismissal
of
a
new
one.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
well,
that's
--
i
feel
creates
no
problem
at
all.
under
the
five-day
limitation
the
court
is
required
to
deny
the
motion.
now
the
government
says,
it's
not
really
denial,
it's
a
dismissal.
but
i
think
that's
a
quibble
which
is
not
consistent
with
the
spirit
of
the
rules.
the
court
would
deny
it
--
would
have
to
deny
it,
there's
no
choice.
this
would
--
therefore,
not
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
proper
administration
of
rule
33
that
governing
motions
for
a
new
trial.
the
government
says,
"well,
this
is
not
too
good
because
it
would
create
a
self-granting
the
extension
of
a
notice
of
appeal."
i
think
there
are
two
argue
--
two
answers
to
that
argument.
first
of
all,
if
the
rules
want
to
provide
a
self-granting
extension,
certainly
there's
no
harm.
secondly,
there
is
no
temptation
for
abuse
present
if
this
is
in
fact
the
case.
it
is
far
easier
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
than
it
is
to
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
the
temptation
for
a
lawyer
to
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
so
he
get
more
time
would
be
also
impossible.
it's
hard
to
imagine
that
exists.
for
that
reason,
i
feel
that
the
harm
urged
by
the
government
and
by
the
third
circuit
would
just
--
just
does
not
exist.
the
ground
urged
by
the
government
in
this
respect
is
that
of
harmonizing
the
rules.
for
the
reason,
i've
just
stated,
i
don't
believe
it
creates
any
disharmony.
and
furthermore,
i
believe
that
that
is
an
insubstantial
consideration
if
that
consideration
afflicts
with
the
policies
of
the
act,
fairness,
simplicity,
and
expeditious
hearing.
the
basic
policy
that
i
think
pervades
both
of
the
issues
before
this
court
is
that
of
referring
direct
appeals
over
collateral
proceedings.
this
policy
has
been
recognized
expressly
in
the
bertone
case
in
this
court
and
the
principles
involved
in
that
policy
have
been
followed
in
the
corey
case,
the
fallen
case
in
this
court,
the
boruff
case
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
calland
case
in
the
seventh
circuit.
these
are
various
settings,
all
portraying
a
clear
application
of
that
principle
and
a
principle
which
is
solely
based
not
only
on
the
rules
themselves,
rule
2
and
rule
52
of
the
--
but
on
a
cognizance
approach
and
a
proper
interpretation
of
such
a
basic
and
important
right
as
preserving
the
right
to
appeal.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
briefly.
i
would
repeat
that
i
think
both
grounds
for
reversal
are
solid
substantial
grounds
and
i
don't
think
either
requires
or
submit
any
denial
or
reversal
or
restriction
of
the
current
rules
or
the
proposed
rules.
it
seems
to
me
in
the
first
place
that
rule
37
very
plainly
sets
forth
what
the
time
is
to
be.
and
that
the
reliance
of
counsel
in
this
case
upon
rule
37
was
almost
induced
by
the
very
exceptionally
clear
language
of
rule
37.
the
fiction
that
every
person
is
presumed
under
the
law
or
even
every
lawyers
presumed
under
the
law
is
just
that,
a
fiction.
in
this
case,
a
lawyer
did
precisely
do
that
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
unhappy
client
should
be
made
to
suffer
for
that.
the
fiction
that
the
lawyer
must
have
known
about,
the
derocco
decision
in
the
sixth
circuit
is
also
i
submit
merely
a
fiction.
the
language
again
does
not
conflict
with
rule
33
in
any
but
a
literary
sense
for
the
reasons
i
gave
earlier.
i
don't
think
that
the
government
has
yet
stated
any
disagreement
with
the
policy
which
i
find
in
the
rules
on
decisions
of
this
court
and
that
is
that
direct
appeals
are
to
be
favored.
and
i
want
to
add
simply
one
citation
of
authority
if
i
may
on
the
point
the
government
raises,
that
the
notice
--
that
the
motion
for
bond
should
be
considered
a
notice
for
appeal.
that
is
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
coppedge
case,
it's
not
cited
in
either
brief,
i'm
sorry
to
say,
is
369
u.s.
438.
mr.
dean
e.
denlinger
369
u.s.
438.
at
footnote
5
of
that
decision
on
page
442,
the
court
indicates
that
it
favors
a
liberal
view
of
papers
filed
by
an
incarcerated
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
and
cites
perfectly
all
the
cases
cited
by
the
government
with
the
apparent
favor
and
i
thus
disagree
with
counsel
for
the
government
that
this
is
at
least
not
today
a
new
invention
that
has
persisted
for
some
time,
it
was
recognized
with
this
court
in
the
coppedge
case
and
i
think
is
wholly
consistent
and
wholly
faithful
to
particularly
rules
2
and
rule
52.
thank
you.
