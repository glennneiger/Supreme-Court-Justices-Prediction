mr.
charles
w.
decker
may
it
please
the
court.
the
parties
to
this
litigation
are
my
clients,
a
railroad
worker
named
fred
gunther,
who
lives
in
san
diego,
california,
and
his
employer,
or
ex-employer,
the
san
diego
and
arizona
eastern
railway
company.
for
the
purposes
of
clarity
in
my
remarks,
i'm
going
to
refer
to
mr.
gunther
as
the
petitioner.
he
is
the
only
petitioner
before
the
court
and
i
will
refer
to
the
respondent,
san
diego
and
arizona
eastern
railway
company,
rather
than
by
that
long
name
as
the
carrier.
before
i
recite
briefly
the
background,
upon
which
the
question
before
the
court
is
predicated,
i
think
i
will
allude
briefly
to
the
issue
because
i
think
that
that
will
clarify
our
approach
to
the
whole
problem.
i
take
it
to
that.
we're
not
concerned
here
with
the
narrow
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
factual
question
for
trial
before
the
judge
in
the
district
court
at
the
time
he
granted
the
respondent's
motion
for
summary
judgment.
i
think
i'm
entitled
to
assume
and
i
certainly
urge
that
a
larger
question
presents
itself
to
the
court
because
of
the
unique
aspect
of
the
case,
not
being
one
where
a
plaintiff
is
pursuing
an
ordinary
civil
remedy
or
a
common
law
remedy,
but
a
case
where
the
petitioner
is
suing
pursuant
to
section
153
(p)
of
title
45
of
the
united
states
code
to
enforce
an
award
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
that
was
the
nature
of
the
petition.
and
so
the
larger
question
it
seems
to
me
is,
did
the
district
court,
as
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
respond
to
that
petition
in
a
manner
consistent
with
congressional
purpose
and
with
the
policy
underlying
our
labor
laws
when
it
chose
to
interpret
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
a
manner
contrary
to
the
way
it
had
been
interpreted
by
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
and
on
the
basis
of
that
to
grant
summary
judgment.
i
see
the
light
is
--
mr.
charles
w.
decker
that
the
judicial
remedy
provided
by
section
153
(p)
of
title
45
is
of
extreme
importance
to
the
railroad
worker.
if
he
goes,
takes
his
grievance
or
his
claim
to
the
railroad
adjustment
board
as
is
his
right
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
if
that
claim
is
sustained,
he
wins
his
case
before
the
board,
and
then
because
the
award
is
not
self-enforcing,
if
his
employer
refuses
to
comply
with
that
award,
he
has
only
one
place
to
go
for
relief
and
that's
the
district
court
under
section
153
(p).
obviously,
this
is
an
important
remedy.
now,
to
get
to
the
background
of
this
particular
case,
my
client,
mr.
gunther
has
worked
for
the
san
diego
and
arizona
eastern
railway
company
for
many,
many
years,
most
of
it
as
an
engineer
so
that
by
1954,
he
was
the
most
senior
engineer
and
the
employee
of
the
company.
during
that
time,
he
was
general
chairman
for
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
fireman
and
engineman,
a
standard
railway
organization
which
up
until
1958,
as
i
recall,
held
the
contract
on
the
property
for
firemen
and
hostlers.
it
can
be
presumed
then
that
during
this
time
he
was
participating
in
enforcing
and
applying
that
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
1953,
on
december
8,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
of
1953,
mr.
gunther
became
70
years
of
age
and
at
that
time,
although
in
the
past
he'd
only
been
required
to
take
a
physical
examination
once
a
year.
the
company
required
him
to
start
taking
physical
examinations
each
three
months,
which
he
did
without
anything
untoward
occurring
until
the
last
such
examination
which
occurred
on
december
15,
1954
or
thereabouts,
at
which
time
he
was
informed
by
his
employer
that
the
company
doctors
did
not
consider
that
he
was
physically
fit
to
continue
in
service
as
a
railroad
engineer.
the
findings
of
these
physicians
were
reviewed
by
the
chief
surgeon
in
san
francisco
and
he
advised,
and
it's
in
the
record
before
the
board
as
well
as
the
court,
that
in
his
opinion,
mr.
gunther
was
likely
to
suffer
an
acute
coronary
episode.
on
the
basis
of
that,
mr.
gunther
was
taken
out
of
service.
he
immediately
initiated
and
commenced
the
exhaustion
of
his
administrative
remedy
and
eventually
his
case
wound
up
before
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
there
was
an
initial
award
in
1956
which
established
a
three-doctor
panel
and
a
subsequent
award
or
interpretation
thereof
in
1958,
which
on
the
basis
of
the
reports
of
the
physicians
in
the
three-doctor
panel
established
that
mr.
gunther
should
be
reinstated
to
his
position
with
back
pay.
mr.
charles
w.
decker
this
is
not
alleged.
there's
no
such
allegation
in
the
petition
and
there
was
no
such
allegation
in
any
of
the
affidavits
before
the
court
at
the
time
when
summary
judgment
was
entered.
the
award
itself,
i
think
we
should
take
a
look
at,
it's
found
at
page
9
of
the
record.
the
first
award
back
in
1956,
being
on
page
5
and
then
the
interpretation
on
page
9.
the
court
will
note
that
the
board
set
out
its
findings
initially
saying
that
it
is
true
that
the
carrier
has
the
right
and
responsibility
in
determining
within
proper
limits,
the
physical
fitness
of
employees
to
remain
in
service.
it
is
true
also
that
the
employee
has
the
right
to
priority
in
service
according
to
his
seniority
and
pursuant
to
the
agreements
so
long
as
he
is
physically
qualified,
where
these
two
rights
come
in
to
collision,
it
is
consistently
been
held
by
this
division
that
it
has
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
the
employee
has
wrongfully
been
deprived
of
service.
the
board
then
goes
on
to
point
out
that
since
the
determination
of
the
facts
necessary
to
enable
the
division
to
make
an
award
on
this
issue
requires
medical
confidence.
it
finds
that
a
three-doctor
panel
should
be
established
and
concludes
if
the
decision
of
the
majority
of
such
board
shall
support
the
decision
of
the
carrier's
chief
surgeon,
the
claim
will
be
denied.
if
not,
it
will
be
sustained
with
pay
pursuant
to
rule
on
the
property
from
october
15,
1955.
now,
the
event,
excuse
me,
the
events
that
transpired
after
that,
of
course
were
that
a
neutral
physician
was
appointed
that
is
the
carrier
did
comply
with
the
award
to
the
extent
of
cooperating
in
the
establishment
of
a
three-doctor
panel
but
when
that
neutral
doctor's
report
was
in,
the
carrier
chose
to
interpret
his
findings
as
being
supporting
those
of
its
chief
surgeon
rather
than
being
contrary.
mr.
charles
w.
decker
excuse
me
sir,
yes?
mr.
charles
w.
decker
i
can
not
answer
that
question
sir.
i
--
there
is
not
in
the
record
but
there
was
before
the
appellate
court,
a
whole
host
of
decisions
by
the
adjustment
board
setting
up
three-doctor
panels
of
this
kind
and
there
are
reports
in
the
federal
reporting
system
indicating
that
this
has
happened
in
the
past.
mr.
charles
w.
decker
that's
right.
mr.
charles
w.
decker
yes,
that's
true.
except
sir,
i
would
like
to
note
that
what
is
the
agreement
is
perhaps
the
question
for
the
board.
the
problem
has
existed
in
this
case
throughout
has
been
that
the
court
has
considered
that
the
only
evidence,
evidentiary
source
for
the
agreement
between
the
brotherhood
and
railroad
in
this
case
is
this
document
right
here
which
bears
on
its
face,
the
legend
that
it's
the
rules
effective
march
1,
1935
revised
rates
of
pay
effective
october
something,
october
30
i
think
it
is
1937.
so
the
question
as
to
what
the
agreement
is,
we
contend
is
before
the
court
it
was
--
and
that
properly
the
board
has
the
right
to
look
elsewhere
than
within
the
framework
of
this
document,
the
green
covers
of
this
document
to
determine
what
the
underlying
rights
and
duties
of
the
parties
are.
mr.
charles
w.
decker
that's
true
sir.
now,
i
want
to
read
this
language
though
in
that
connection.
if
carrier
through
its
medical
staff
has
removed
an
employee
from
service
in
good
faith
on
the
basis
of
a
fair
standard
of
fitness
applied
to
his
physical
condition
adequately
determined
is
more
than
just
a
problem
of
good
faith
here.
and
i
take
it
that
the
subsequent
determination
by
the
board,
that
the
man
should
be
reinstated
with
bad
faith
constitutes
an
implied
finding
by
the
board
that
on
the
basis
of
the
reports
of
the
neutral
position
that
perhaps
the
physical
fitness
of
mr.
gunther
had
not
been
adequately
determined
by
the
company
or
it
had
not
applied
a
fairly
standard
of
fitness.
continuing
then
the
--
in
1958
this
open
ended
award
was
made
affine.
and
the
board
said
the
issue
of
fact
upon
which
the
prior
award
was
conditioned
having
been
determined
in
favor
of
claimant
said
conditional
award
should
be
made
absolute
and
final
and
the
claim
sustained
as
therein
provided,
and
then
it
went
ahead
with
its
award
and
order.
now,
within
the
period
of
time
which
the
labor
--
mr.
charles
w.
decker
yes,
sir?
mr.
charles
w.
decker
as
a
practical
matter,
no.
mr.
charles
w.
decker
that's
right.
he
will
be
82
on
december
8.
mr.
charles
w.
decker
that's
true
sir,
that's
the
way
the
petition
reads
just
before
--
that
was
before
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
w.
decker
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
decker
well,
so
far
as
the
record
before
this
court
indicates,
it's
being
pressed,
but
as
a
practical
matter
the
man
is
82
years
old.
the
carrier
has
raised
the
point
that
he's
precluded
because
he
hasn't
reported
for
a
physical
examination
and
established
his
physical
fitness.
mr.
charles
w.
decker
yes,
under
the
59
contract.
but,
this
again
is
simply
not
in
the
record.
the
record
so
far
is
that
it
appears
now
--
mr.
charles
w.
decker
no,
i'm
asking
this
court
to
give
my
client
his
day
in
court
whatever
that
maybe
whether
it's
a
trial
de
novo
or
a
limited
review
of
some
kind
which
i
intend
to
get
to
later.
mr.
charles
w.
decker
shall
we
go
up
the
record?
well,
sir,
first
of
all,
as
it's
been
pointed
out
in
several
opinions
of
this
court
and
in
the
congressional
records
before
hearings
in
congress.
it
was
a
standard
practice
before
the
humphreys
case
in
1963
for
the
railroad
organizations
to
enforce
awards
by
threat
of
strike.
this
could
account
for
the
lapse
of
two
years
almost
between
the
time
the
58
award
was
made
and
the
time
the
petition
was
filed
in
the
san
diego
court,
the
second
time.
just
before
the
limitation
period
round
there
was
another
suit
started
in
san
diego
and
that's
the
suit
just
before
this
court
today
of
course.
initially,
the
respondent,
the
carrier
without
answers
simply
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
asserting
that
this
was
the
agreement,
there's
nothing
in
here
limiting
the
employer's
right
to
determine
the
physical
fitness
of
his
employees.
therefore
on
theory
there,
the
board's
jurisdiction
is
limited
to
the
interpretation
on
application
of
existing
agreements
and
this
is
the
agreement,
the
claim
was
thought.
initially,
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
rejected
but
without
prejudice
to
its
renewal
and
it
was
then
renewed
on
this
same
identical
ground
and
the
district
court
granted
that
motion.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
what
the
district
court
said.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
what
the
district
court
did
was
to
interpret
this
document
read
it
very
carefully,
noted
for
instance,
that
the
only
reference
in
this
agreement
to
physical
condition
is
a
provision
in
here
that
a
one-eyed
engineer
has
a
right
to
displace
a
junior
fireman.
that's
the
only
thing
in
this
book
that
has
any
reference
at
all
to
physical
condition
of
employees.
it
caused
the
--
mr.
charles
w.
decker
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
decker
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
decker
that's
true.
mr.
charles
w.
decker
i
certainly
do
not
sir.
all
i'm
pointing
out
is
--
mr.
charles
w.
decker
i
think
--
mr.
charles
w.
decker
yes
my
only
point
mr.
justice
white
is,
is
that
this
agreement
is
such
a
fragmentary
and
--
mr.
charles
w.
decker
the
seniority
and
wrongful
discharge
provisions.
mr.
charles
w.
decker
the
--
mr.
charles
w.
decker
the
agreement
read
as
a
whole
has
enormous
gaps
in
it
and
one
of
the
examples
it
seems
to
me
of
the
type
of
agreement
it
is
as
being
a
unique
instrument
and
something
quite
different
than
we
ran
across
in
industry,
labor
industry
contracts
other
than
the
rail
industry,
is
the
fact
that
there
would
be
absolutely
nothing
in
it
at
all
about
what
a
man's
rights
are,
specifically,
what
a
man's
rights
are
to
in
the
event
he's
found
not
to
be
physically
qualified.
there's
not
even
any
provision
in
there
for
this
yearly
examination
that
was
taken.
this,
i
simply
refer
to
fortify
my
argument
that
a
reasonable
construction
of
this
agreement
requires
resort
to
extrinsic
evidence.
the
district
court
said
in
its
opinion
that
the
board
should
have
interpreted
the
agreement
the
way
i
have.
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
its
opinion
that
the
board
has
exceeded
its
jurisdiction
obviously
inferring
that
it
had
accepted
the
proposition
that
the
board's
jurisdiction
was
limited
to
the
interpretation
and
application
of
documents
and
that
it
did
not
find
in
this
document
any
limitation
upon
the
employer's
right
to
determine
the
physical
fitness
of
its
employees
therefore
it
disagreed
with
the
board,
the
board's
award
was
ultra
virus
and
should
be
set
aside.
now,
i
don't
have
much
time
and
i
want
to
get
to
the
issue,
was
this
summary
disposition
of
the
petition
in
this
case
consistent
with
congressional
purpose,
when
it
enacted
the
compulsory
arbitration
scheme
for
the
disposition
of
disputes
arising
out
of
grievances,
and
out
of
the
interpretation
and
application
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
may
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
jurisdictional
grant
in
the
railway
labor
act
does
not
limit
the
board's
jurisdiction
to
the
interpretation
and
application
of
agreements,
it
confers
upon
the
board
jurisdiction
to
determine
disputes
arising
out
of
grievances
and
out
of
the
interpretation
and
application
of
agreements.
since
i
filed
the
petitioner's
brief
in
this
case
and
today
i've
had
occasion
to
concern
myself
somewhat
more
with
the
issue
before
the
court
in
terms
of
scope
of
review
and
in
that
connection,
i
have
noticed
judge
frankfurter's
reference
to
the
fact
that
when
the
railway
labor
act
was
amended
in
1934
to
provide
for
compulsory
arbitrations,
congress
chose
to
use
the
language
which
was
a
part
of
what
is
now
section
16
(2)
of
title
49.
this
is
the
provision
for
enforcement
of
reparation
orders
made
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
if
the
court
will
refer
to
that
section,
it
will
see
that
the
language
in
the
railway
labor
act,
section
153
(p)
which
refers
to
the
mode
of
enforcement
is
taken
from
the
interstate
commerce
act.
i'm
referring
now
to
the
language
which
says
that
the
petition
shall
proceed,
and
that
is
the
suit
on
the
petition,
shall
proceed
in
all
respects
as
other
civil
suits
and
the
order
of
the
division
adjustment
boards
of
the
prima
facie
evidence
of
the
facts
therein
stated.
now
in
1889
when
the
erdman
act
being
came
the
law,
the
predecessor
of
the
present
interstate
commerce
act,
the
congress
was
very
much
concerned
about
the
constitutional
limitations,
it
might
impose
upon
the
power
of
an
administrative
agency
to
grant
money
judgments
and
consequently,
it
placed
in
the
enforcement
section
of
the
act
having
to
do
with
reparation
orders
and
what
should
happen
to
them
after
they're
made
by
the
commission
that
the
suit
was
to
proceed
as
in
all
respects
as
a
civil
suit
and
a
jury
trial
was
to
be
permitted.
and
then
in
1906,
when
the
hepburn
act
was
adopted
amending
the
original
interstate
commerce
act,
the
reference
to
a
jury
trial
was
deleted.
i
take
it
that
we
can
infer
from
congressional
record
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
to
create
an
administrative
agency
which
could
make
a
reparation
order
which
would
be
enforceable
in
court
and
providing
for
review
in
the
enforcing
court
only
to
the
extent
that
the
constitution
required.
now
it's
my
opinion
based
upon
my
study
of
the
congressional
record
that
this
undoubtedly
is
the
most
reasonable
explanation
for
what
congress
intended
in
1934
when
it
chose
this
language
to
use
in
describing
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
to
be
had
in
an
enforcement
action
of
awards
from
railway
adjustment
board.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
testimony
before
the
senate
committee
of
congress
in
connection
with
this
bill
proposed
amendment
to
the
railway
labor
act,
wherein
--
mr.
charles
w.
decker
it's
not,
judge
black.
but
in
that
record
of
the
hearings
before
the
interstate
commerce
committee
of
the
senate,
both
carrier
representatives
and
labor
representatives
made
it
clear
that
they
considered
that
what
they
were
doing
in
providing
for
enforcement
of
adjustment
board
awards
was
setting
up
that
they
were
to
be
reviewed
in
exactly
the
same
manner
that
arbitration
awards
were
to
be
reviewed
as
established
in
section
9
and
the
provisions
for
arbitration
had
been
in
the
act
since
it
was
initially
passed.
mr.
charles
w.
decker
yes
i
do.
i'm
a
little
bit
confused
trying
to
hurry
here
and
i
can
provide
those
citations
to
the
court,
but
the
conclusion
of
counsel's
answer.
i
have
them
the
page
number
of
the
record
on
it,
thank
you.
