mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
mr.
chief
justice
the
associate
justices,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
question
which
we
believe
is
an
extremely
important
one
when
one
considers
as
the
court
of
appeals
points
out
in
its
decision
that
the
railroad
has
a
prime
responsibility
with
respect
to
its
operations
in
interstate
commerce
and
as
we
well
know
with
respect
to
its
own
employee.
the
railroad
as
is
conceded
in
the
petitioner's
brief
and
in
his
argument
has
the
--
has
had
a
rule
over
a
period
of
years
and
as
his
brief
concedes
that
has
not
been
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
rule
requires
its
engineers
who
will
operate
locomotives
and
trains
to
take
a
physical
examination
at
periodic
intervals
to
determine
their
qualification
to
perform
that
job.
mr.
gunther,
the
petitioner
over
the
years
recognizing
that
rule
and
at
the
same
time
as
counsel
has
pointed
out
being
a
general
chairman
of
the
fireman's
organization
reported
to
those
physical
examinations
and
passed
them
over
the
years.
the
rule
requires
that
if
one
becomes
age
70;
he
must
take
such
a
physical
every
90
days.
this
he
did
and
on
about
the
fifth
examination,
shortly
after
age
71,
the
carrier's
physicians
found
that
there
was
some
condition
of
his
heart
from
which
it
could
be
supposed
or
predicted
that
he
might
have
an
arterial
coronary
episode.
as
has
been
pointed
out
here,
there's
been
no
charge
from
the
beginning
of
this
case
to
now
that
the
carrier
acted
in
bad
faith
or
that
the
carrier's
doctors
in
making
their
examinations
acted
in
bad
faith
or
in
fact
in
any
way
other
than
in
utmost
good
faith.
thereafter,
the
matter
was
reviewed
in
san
francisco
and
the
findings
were
confirmed
and
mr.
gunther
then
contended
that
his
rights
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
had
been
violated
his
seniority
right,
his
seniority
right,
a
right
predicated
on
an
agreement
provision
preventing
layoff
and
a
right
predicated
upon
agreement
provision
providing
for
investigation
upon
dismissals.
now
a
question
arose
here
--
i
might
state
that
that
argument
was
presented
to
the
carrier
as
is
required
under
section
3
first
(i)
and
thereafter,
after
being
handled
on
the
property
was
presented
in
the
same
manner
to
the
adjustment
board
as
it
appears
in
the
record.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
the
agreement
provides
that
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
in
essence
yes.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
it
provides
for
no
dismissal
without
prior
investigation
and
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
and
for
fault,
being
guilty
as
charged,
right.
however
there
was
no
finding
of
the
board
with
respect
to
being
guilty
or
not
guilty
as
charged
under
that
section,
so
far
as
the
record
demonstrates.
in
other
words,
the
board
referred
to
the
seniority
provision
and
he
sad
that
it
would
not
be
deprived
of
the
seniority
unless
an
examination
had
been
conducted
in
bad
faith
and
that
seemed
to
be
the
test.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
good
and
bad
faith
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
the
interpretation
by
the
adjustment
board
so
states
your
honor.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
when
they
set
forth
the
question
--
first
of
all,
they
don't
point
to
any
provision,
as
far
as
i
can
see,
that
limits
the
carrier
in
making
these
decisions
as
based
upon
its
doctor's
findings
as
to
the
ability
of
an
engineer
for
foreign
service.
it
doesn't
point
to
any
provision
in
the
agreement
providing
for
review
of
these
decisions
and
it
doesn't
point
to
any
provision
in
the
agreement
providing
for
a
three-doctor
panel
to
arbitrate
this
matter.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
that's
true.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
as
a
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
they
said
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
your
honor
in
the
1956
award,
we
say
first
appointed
this
board.
they
stated
that
if
the
finding
of
a
three-doctor
panels
shall
sustain
the
chief
surgeon,
as
it
be
one
way
and
if
the
finding
overruled
them,
it'd
be
the
other
way.
they
delegated
the
entire
responsibility
to
this
three-doctor
panel.
and
as
far
as
i
know,
having
determined
that
the
issue
was
good
and
bad
faith
and
adequacy
of
findings
as
was
discussed
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
finding
that
there
was
any
violation,
if
those
were
parts
of
the
contract.
our
position
is
your
honor
that
those
were
not
--
that
the
contract
did
not
provide
in
any
manner
for
a
review
of
the
decision
of
the
chief
surgeon.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
our
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
in
determining
the
bad
faith
question,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
my
position
on
that
your
honor
is
that
this
adequate
determination
is
a
statement
made
by
the
board
which
doesn't
appear
to
be
founded
in
the
contract.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
now,
that's
true
too.
but
i
would
concede
that
if
the
carrier
acted
in
bad
faith
or
there
was
a
charge
of
it
that
there's
a
--
as
the
court
of
appeals
points
out
that
there'd
be
a
possibility
of
a
proper
grievance
under
the
contract,
otherwise,
i
wouldn't
think
so.
now
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
right
your
honor.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
i
think
not
your
honor.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
i
would
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
your
honor,
i
would
think
not
because
i
don't
think
that
you
--
the
carrier
can
state
that
its
doctor
is
always
correct.
in
other
words
doctors
do
make
mistakes
and
i
think
that
the
carrier
has
a
right
to
rely
in
what
it
thinks
is
the
proper
professional
opinion
of
his
doctor,
it's
not
educated
as
to
that.
and
it
--
when
it
follows
--
if
it
refused
to
follow
the
doctor's
opinion,
even
though
if
the
doctor
made
a
mistake
--
or
to
restate
that
--
if
the
doctor
said
that
the
man
was
not
qualified
to
run
a
locomotive.
and
the
carrier
put
the
man
on
the
locomotive
nevertheless,
what
would
have
been
the
outcome
if
there
had
been
an
accident
in
that.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
think
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
but
i
would
think
that
he
would
have
the
right
as
a
grievance.
in
other
words
that
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
that's
true.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
yes.
well
it
seems
to
me
that
if
that
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
carrier
and
the
carrier
nevertheless
flouted
it
that
he
would
have
a
right.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
that's
right.
that's
what
i
think
is
predicated
on
bad
faith.
now
mr.
decker
pointed
out
that
this
green
agreement,
was
the
thing
that
the
--
well
i
want
to
say
one
thing
before
i
pass
to
that.
that
is
that
this
engineer
was
not
discharged
in
any
respect,
this
engineer
was
taken
out
of
active
service.
now
it's
true
that
it
could
be
said
that
in
effect
that
if
you
take
--
if
you
prevent
somebody
from
using
their
seniority
rights
that
you
then
bring
about
a
discharge,
if
you
look
at
it
that
way.
however,
there's
no
showing
or
argument
that
the
man
was
taken
off
the
roster
or
was
discharged
as
that
section
prescribed.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
he
wouldn't
be
recalled
except
under
these
circumstances
your
honor,
if
he
should
go
and
take
a
physical
under
this
1959
agreement
and
if
he
were
well
and
then
he
would
pass
and
he
would
be
entitled
to
go
back
on
an
engine.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
if
he
passed
the
physical
we
would
have
no
choice
but
to
follow
our
agreement.
now
this
agreement
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
i
agree
with
you
your
honor.
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
we'd
be
in
violation
of
the
agreement,
if
we
didn't
put
him
back.
it
might
we'd
be
willing
to
balance
that
against
safety
at
the
interstate
commerce
in
our
opinion
and
i
don't
know
what
would
happen.
but
i
would
say
there
would
be
an
agreement
violation
since
1959.
now
my
opponent
said
that
there
was
a
green
pamphlet
that
covered
the
man's
rights
as
of
1938
and
therefore
as
of
1954.
we've
demonstrated
in
our
brief
as
i
think
the
lower
courts
have
pointed
out
that
the
1938
agreement
was
not
believed
necessarily
to
be
the
whole
agreement
if
somebody
would
point
to
a
provision
which
restricted
the
right
of
the
carrier
to
follow
his
doctor's
findings.
in
other
words,
if
the
petitioner
had
at
any
point,
pointed
to
any
evidence
of
such
a
provision
or
pointed
to
any
evidence
of
a
three-doctor
panel
arbitration
prior
to
1959
that
would
have
been
taken
into
account
and
the
court
in
fact
made
several
invitations
to
the
petitioner
to
do
so
and
he
did
not
do
so.
so
that
the
court
did
not
limit
it
to
the
green
booklet,
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
testimony
of
--
and
the
affidavits
of
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
general
chairman
on
the
motion
under
rule
60
(b).
and
i
believe
earlier
in
that
case,
it
was
pointed
out
that
petitioner
was
familiar
with
the
agreement
with
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
agreement
in
that
he
represented
other
engineers
on
the
property
in
asserting
their
rights
under
the
agreement.
and
that
he
would
be
therefore
fully
familiar
with
it
and
that
comes
about
because
the
general
chairman
of
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
fireman
and
engineman,
under
the
statute
has
the
right
to
represent
anybody
in
the
service.
whether
they'd
be
engineers
or
fireman
and
if
they
are
members
of
his
organization
as
is
permitted
under
the
railway
labor
act
because
it's
an
organization
national
in
scope
admitting
to
membership
both
engineers
and
fireman,
why,
he
could
do
this.
now,
he
was
familiar
with
the
agreement
and
yet,
he
didn't
and
couldn't
point
to
any
provision
other
than
those
that
seniority,
layoff
and
discharge
for
cause
that
have
been
mentioned.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
no,
well
your
honor,
he
did
this.
after
the
case
was
decided
and
after
long
time
had
passed,
when
he
was
in
the
court
of
appeals,
he
made
a
motion
under
rule
60
(b)
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
said
that
there
were
1944
and
1947
letters.
between
southern
pacific
and
its
engineers
which
there
were,
which
letters
said
that
if
there
were
interpretations
of
rules
on
southern
pacific
that
those
interpretations
would
flow
over
to
san
diego
and
arizona
eastern
bargaining
agreement
into
or
onto
similarly
worded
rules.
now,
it
was
apparent
when
the
court
was
considering
the
rule
60
(b)
motions
and
is
entitled
to
consider
all
the
evidence.
it
was
apparent
that
there
were
no
similarly
worded
rules
on
the
san
diego
and
arizona
eastern
at
that
time,
or
at
any
time
until
1959,
when
article
35
was
amended
to
include
this
three-doctor
panel
review.
and
that
was
a
change
made
pursuant
to
the
section
6
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
provides
a
method
for
changing
agreements.
our
position
is
that
it
is
entirely
improper
to
use
section
3
which
is
the
minor
dispute
provision
to
lodge
a
dispute
in
order
to
get
a
provision
in
the
agreement
when
it's
the
way
to
do
that
is
under
section
6,
which
is
the
method
for
changing
the
agreements.
in
other
words
if
the
person
didn't
have
sick
pay,
if
this
man
had
said
that
he
was
sick
and
wanted
sick
pay.
and
if
the
agreement
didn't
provide
it
and
if
he
made
a
dispute
out
of
it
and
took
to
the
adjustment
board.
and
the
adjustment
board
awarded
him
sick
pay
that
would
be
making
a
provision
in
the
agreement
which
isn't
in
there
and
wasn't
in
there
by
a
means
that
would
be
improper
and
in
violation
of
section
6.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
we
think
that
what
i
just
explained
that
using
one
procedure
to
accomplish
another
objective
would
be
wrong
it's
important
in
that
respect.
secondly,
it's
important
in
so
far
as
determination
of
physical
condition
is
concerned
because
the
agreement
that
we
arrived
at
provides
for
a
specialist
in
the
field,
it
provides
--
it's
a
--
to
my
way
of
understanding,
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
a
board
that
the
adjustment
board
ordered
the
three
doctors,
but
this
sets
forth
what
doctors
they
shall
be.
and
this
comes
at
a
time
when
the
carrier
having
been
forced
in
collective
bargaining
to
enter
into
the
agreement,
now
has
to
relay
on
this
situation.
and
i
think
that,
it's
that
--
the
preservation
of
the
agreement
intact
until
it's
changed
is
important.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
no,
your
honor.
it
wasn't
anything
that
required
them
to
do
so
but
they
did
have
standards
and
they
did
have
specialists
and
they're
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
no.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
yes.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well
i
said
they
did
have
standards.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
they
are
articulated
in
rule
74
or
in
the
standard
as
set
forth
but
they're
not
in
the
record.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
yes,
they
were.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
i
would
have
to
go
outside
the
record
but
there
are
standards
set
up
in
the
hospital
department.
and
these
standards
are
used
by
railroad
physicians.
and
the
general
chairman
of
the
fireman
or
any
other
--
any
employee
can
find
out
what
they
are.
and
certainly
general
chairman
of
the
union
can.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
that
end
thing
you
said
sir?
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
yes.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well
it's
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well
that's
from
the
railroad
standpoint,
the
railroad
will
follow
the
doctor's
advice,
but
the
railroad
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
right.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
you
mean
this
1959
agreement?
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
not
before
this
agreement
your
honor.
not
before
the
‘59
agreement
he
did
not
have.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
right.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
right,
the
absence
of
bad
faith.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
right.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
your
honor
it
wasn't
under
the
agreement,
our
position
is
that
since
there's
nothing
in
the
agreement
which
takes
away
the
right
of
the
carrier
to
decide
the
physical
capacity
of
the
engineer
or
to
review
its
doctor
on
that
decision
that
therefore
there
is
no
agreement
restriction.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
no,
we
did
not
your
honor.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
that's
--
we
had
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
yes,
but
not
relating
to
that
subject.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
yes.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well
our
position
--
yes.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
your
honor
our
position
is
that
that
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well
first
of
all,
i
would
think
it
was
just
cause
but
actually
i
don't
think
it
comes
under
that
provision
because
i
don't
think
that
physical
fitness,
i
think
that's
an
act
of
god,
it's
not
something
that
the
carrier
is
doing
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well
it
would
--
the
doctor
making
the
decision
who
would
be
to
man
with
the
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
i
guess
so
your
honor,
so
far
as
we
are
concerned.
the
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
layoff.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
that
is
seniority
in
reversed
order
of
layoff.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
yes.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
because
we
feel
that
the
contractual
claims
had
to
do
with
seniority
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
i'm
sorry.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
first,
because
the
board
itself
setup
what
its
test
was,
good
faith.
second,
because
the
court
--
the
board
never
did
decide
the
question
of
good
faith.
good
faith
was
never
challenged
all
the
way
up
to
the
board,
it
was
never
exhausted
on
the
property
as
required
under
the
railway
labor
act,
if
there
was
a
charge
of
bad
faith.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
they
found
in
gunther's
favor
by
saying
“we
will
just
turn
this
over
to
a
panel
of
three
doctors
and
whatever
they
say
goes.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
true.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
yes.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
that's
true.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
that's
correct.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
right.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
at
that
point
your
honor,
page
43
of
the
record
there's
an
exhibit
which
is
a
black
book,
which
is
the
rules
of
the
company,
and
just
cause
is
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
the
rules
of
the
company,
general
rules
and
regulations
of
transportation
department,
those
rules
set
forth
all
of
the
things
that
govern
the
employee
such
as
the
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
your
honor
no,
there's
no
such
rule
but
your
honor
we
feel
that
that's
not
covered
by
any
agreement
provision
and
if
it
was
covered
by
the
rules
of
course,
the
rules
are
not
part
of
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
right.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
your
honor
of
course
the
question
is
what
was
the
opinion
of
the
doctor?
in
other
words
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
your
honor
that's
bad
faith
again
but
in
the
absence
of
bad
faith,
i
would
say,
yes.
and
i
would
say
that
that's
what
if
anything
would
have
led
to
the
1959
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well
i
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
a
question
of
physical
condition
as
against
the
exercise
of
seniority
under
the
agreement.
and
i
think
this
physical
condition
thing
takes
it
out
of
the
scope
of
the
agreement.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
nothing
is
wrong
with
it
as
except
this
that
some
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well
--
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
no,
your
honor
the
thing
that's
wrong
is
that
it's
a
majority
of
two
out
of
three.
so
the
two
doctors
say
one
doctor
is
wrong.
we
haven't
given
up
the
right
to
rely
on
our
own
doctor's
decision
until
1959.
and
so
that
the
thing
that's
wrong
with
it
is
that
something's
being
injected
into
the
agreement
that
wasn't
in
there
in
the
first
place.
by
a
means
that
was
not
used
in
‘59
namely
by
a
means
it's
not
provided
in
the
railway
labor
act,
section
6.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
true.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
right.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
true.
mr.
waldron
a.
gregory
well,
the
thing
is
wrong
with
it
your
honor
is
that
it
was
a
fashioning
of
a
remedy
that
wasn't
provided
for
in
the
agreement.
that
it
was,
this
is
not
like
the
national
railway
adjustment
board.
this
is
a
--
i
mean
like
the
taft-hartley
industry.
this
is
a
case
where
one
neutral
is
assigned
for
one
case
and
another
neutral
and
another
neutral.
now
if
you
could
change
--
if
you
could
provide
that
under
the
agreement
as
it
was
and
then
you
can
also
provide
at
a
later
time
that
when
this
1959
agreement
is
brought
up
that
you
should
have
three
doctors.
you
might
be
able
to
emasculate
that
remedy
and
the
other
in
the
reverse.
so
i
think
that
the
board,
when
it
was
talking
about
the
first
thing
you
said
it
was
talking
about
a
right
in
the
carrier.
when,
i
was
talking
about
the
second
thing
that
you
mentioned
the
seniority
right,
it's
talking
about
a
right
emanating
from
the
agreement.
thank
you
for
considering
it.
