mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
he
made
a
(inaudible)
did
he
not
in
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
spoke
with
the
great
importance
of
this
case
to
the
railroad,
what
is
the
great
importance
of
it
now
saying
that
if
you
have
agreed
to
adhere
with
the
unions
that
in
the
future
this
three-doctor
board
would
in
such
cases
be
appointed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
other
ground
between
the
case
that
they
were
all
specialists
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
didn't
the
board
determine,
did
it
not,
that
there
should've
been
some
standards
that
the
railroad
have
to
go
by
in
determining
whether
a
man
was
physically
fit
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
they
were
not?
it
was
not
necessarily
for
them
to
have
any
standards?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what?
were
they
articulated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
they
articulated
for
this
particular
petitioner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
know
where
could
you
find
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gregory,
what
can
prove
this
as
to
the
only
way
it
could
be
turned
to
the
carrier
and
remove
petitioner
from
service
and
good
faith
on
the
basis
of
a
fair
standard
of
fitness
was
to
have
petitioner
examined
by
a
neutral
board
of
three
physicians.
well
what
is
wrong
with
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
you
lost
before
the
board.
chief
justice
earl
warren
show
them
that
they
were
wrong
about
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
board
said
it
had
two
--
there
were
two
rights
under
the
contract,
one
accruing
to
the
carrier
and
one
accruing
to
the
employee.
chief
justice
earl
warren
first,
that
the
carrier
in
a
fair
way
could
determine
who
is
fit
to
act
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
be
employed
by
it.
and
the
second
was
that
the
employee
had
certain
priority
due
to
his
seniority.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
company,
and
that
in
this
situation
those
two
rights
came
into
conflict.
and
then
the
board
said
that
in
order
to
decide
that
conflict,
the
only
way
that
it
could
do
it
when
the
employee's
doctor
said,
he
was
all
right
and
the
railroad
said
that
he
was
not
fit
was
for
them,
as
a
board
to
appoint,
three
neutral
doctors
to
determine
then
a
majority
of
them
should
prevail.
now
what
is
wrong
with
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
