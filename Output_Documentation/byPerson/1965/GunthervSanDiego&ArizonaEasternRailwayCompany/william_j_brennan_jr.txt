(inaudible)
justice

brennan,

(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
that's
part
of
the
opinion?

brennan,

no
appeal
are
you
telling
us
to
the
just
cause
provision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
that
provision
agreement
on
â€“
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
cause,
is
that
the
one
is
that
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
at
age
82?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wouldn't
be
much
interested
in
riding
your
railroad
then.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
did
not
have
you
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
the
absence
of
some
showing
of
what
you
call
bad
faith.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
otherwise
under
the
agreement
the
determination
by
the
railroad's
position
is
conclusive
upon
it
and
he
does
--
and
he
is
without
a
remedy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
don't
quite
get.
i
understand
that
as
originally
presented
to
the
adjustment
board,
that
got
beyond
the
railroad
for
a
moment.
you
concede
that
the
claim
of
gunther
relied
upon
the
seniority
provision
of
the
agreement
--
the
investigation
proceeding
of
the
agreement
and
what
was
the
third
you
said?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
layoff.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
now
that's
the
posture
in
which
you've
got
to
the
board.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
why
is
it
you
say
the
board's
decision
was
not
a
decision
of
the
contractual
claims
made
by
gunther?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
that
wasn't
my
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
question
is
why
do
you
say
that
the
board's
decision,
favorable
to
gunther
was
not
rested
on
a
resolution
of
one
of
those
contractual
claims?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
did
find
in
gunther's
favor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
it
your
position
that
nothing
in
the
agreement,
even
though
these
contractual
--
this
gunther's
claim
was
rested
on
contract
provision,
none
of
those
embraced
in
the
authority
and
the
board
to
delegate
the
reexamination
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
a
doctor
--
of
three-doctor
board,
is
that
it?
