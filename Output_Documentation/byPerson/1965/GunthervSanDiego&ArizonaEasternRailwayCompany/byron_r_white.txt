contract
and
forbidding
discharges
except
for
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
exactly
say
that
but
that's
their
reading
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
assuming
it
did,
do
you
concede
that
the
provision
against
discharges
except
for
cause
has
no
relationship
whatsoever
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
contract
you
claim
does
deal
with
physical
fitness
discharges?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
sense
that
it's
not
for
good
cause
if
you
discharge
a
man
who's
found
to
be
physically
qualified.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
nothing
fragmentary
about
the
provisions
of
courts
of
appeals
cited,
quoted
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
nothing
fragmentary
about
those?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
a
citation
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
for
fault.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
word
is
bad
--
how
does
good
and
bad
faith
get
into
the
right--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
if
you're
relying
on
the
contract
there's
something
this
contract
about
good
and
bad
faith?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
you
take
their
interpretation
of
the
contract
for
one
purpose
and
not
another?
justice
byron
r.
white
will
you
take
their
interpretation
of
the
contract
for
one
purpose
and
not
another?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
i
know
it
doesn't
refer
to
any
particular
provision,
but
in
response
to
the
carrier's
contentions,
it
said
in
its
initial
ruling
that
the
matter
of
a
fitness
had
to
be
adequately
determined
than
the
contract.
and
if
it
wasn't,
there
was
a
right
to
reinstatement.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
now
then
that
their
interpretation
of
the
contract
and
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
they
go
on
and
say
that
the
words
challenged
where
the
physical
fitness
findings
the
carrier
challenged
that
they
will
appoint
a
three-member
panel
to
determine
the
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
will
deprive
them
on
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
specific
point
is
not
that
the
board
couldn't
have
reviewed
this
finding
of
fitness,
but
that
it
shouldn't
have
reverted
to
a
three-doctor
panel?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
thing
that's
wrong
here
is
that
they
did
use
the
three-man
panel
instead
of
determining
the
matter
itself
making
evidence
in
determining
the
matter
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
adequately
determined
question,
i
mean
that's
an
adequate
determination
as
this
much
as
they're
ruling
here
as
good
faith.
justice
byron
r.
white
nor
does
good
faith.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
would
never
be
recalled.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
of
82?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
have
seen
this
and
this
suggests
that
the
board
didn't
even
purport
to
be
relying
on
the
contract
in
doing
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
you
say,
you
suggest
to
us
that
we
should
not
accept
this
adjustment
board's
decision
as
being
rested
on
the
contract,
as
being
an
interpretation
of
the
contract
as
claimed
in
the
presentation.
