justice
potter

going
back
for
a
moment
again
to
the
original
order
on
page
5,
is
it
your
understanding
that
the
division
of
the
board
in
the
language
that
you
read
to
us
has
followed
that
policy
in
that
way
doing
things
without
regard
at
all
to
any
collective
bargaining
agreement
on
the
property?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
he's
right
is
a
priority,
seniority
rights
necessarily
depend
upon
the
collective
bargaining
agreements.
so
to
that
extent
the
second
sentence
on
the
third
from
the
last
paragraph
on
page
6
necessarily
refers
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
without
the
agreement
he
would
not
have
any
seniority
rights?
justice
potter
stewart
what
puzzled
me
about
this
order
as
in
connection
with
what
happened
afterwards
was
simply
this.
that
this
order,
it
seems
to
be
is
tied
to
the
agreement
in
so
far
as,
it
correctly
says
that
this
petitioner
has
certain
seniority
rights
to
remain
on
the
job,
and
it
furthers
says
that
he
can
not
be
deprived
of
those
rights
in
bad
faith.
there's
a
reference
to
a
good
faith
with
which
i
suppose
the
carrier
would
agree.
but
then
from
then
on
the
interpretation
didn't
make
any
reference
at
all
of
good
faith
or
bad
faith,
it
simply
superseded
the
carrier's
doctor.
those
carrier's
doctors
have
professional
judgment
with
the
professional
judgment
of
three
other
doctors
and
no
reference
to
bad
faith
and
there
was
no
further
reference
that
i
could
find
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
--
as
i
understand
what
you
just
said,
you
conceded
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
that
if
it
could
be
shown
that
the
finding
that
this
man
was
in
questionable
health
was
in
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
carrier,
the
man
would
have
a
grievance
under
the
contract.
that
is
because
of
the
seniority
rights
given
to
him
under
the
contract.
justice
potter
stewart
when
what
if
it
could
be
shown
that
the
violator
was
no
bad
faith.
still,
there
was
a
completely
mistaken
diagnosis
of
this
man
and
that
on
any
objective
test
by
any
qualified
physicians,
he
was
entirely
well
and
that
the
finding
that
he
was
in
dubious
health
was
a
matter
of
a
complete
mistake.
they
got
somebody
else's
records
or
something
like
that.
would
he
then
have
a
grievance?
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
he
then
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
have
his
seniority
rights
to
serve
as
an
engineer
if
he
was
in
perfect
good
health?
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don't
question
the
carrier's
right
--
if
not
the
carrier's
duty
in
the
first
instance
to
take
this
man
out
of
the
cab
of
the
locomotive,
if
they
have
a
finding
by
their
chief
surgeon
that
he's
going
to
have
a
heart
attack.
but
then
let's
say
the
man
has
a
reason
to
think
that
he's
perfectly
well
and
he
has
then
â€“-
he
finds
that
he
can
prove
that
the
finding
of
the
company's
chief
surgeon
was
based
upon
a
fact
that
he,
by
mistake,
got
somebody
else's
cardiogram.
now
doesn't
--
wouldn't
he
have
a
right
under
the
--
wouldn't
the
petitioner
have
a
right
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
his
ordinary
seniority
right,
if
he
could
show
that
in
fact
he
was
entirely
well
and
that
the
finding
by
the
--
upon
which
the
carrier
relied
was
just
maybe
not
a
negligent
mistake
but
just
completely
unsubstantiated.
justice
potter
stewart
well
the
grievance
would
have
to
be
under
the
agreement
wouldn't
it?
in
the
absence
of
any
collective
bargaining
agreement
at
all,
i
suppose
the
carrier
could
fire
and
hire
engineers
at
will
without
any
seniority
or
anything
else,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
would
have
to
be
under
the
agreement,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
then
there'd
be
bad
faith
if
that's
the
case,
as
what
you
said.
