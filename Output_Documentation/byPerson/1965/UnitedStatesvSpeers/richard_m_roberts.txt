mr.
richard
m.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states,
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
affirmed
a
holding
by
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
ohio,
which
it
upheld
a
holding
by
the
referee
in
bankruptcy's
determination
that
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
was
a
“judgment
creditor”
as
that
term
is
used
in
title
26
of
the
united
states
code,
section
6323.
and
therefore
the
tax
mean
notice
of
which
had
not
been
filed
prior
to
the
petition
in
bankruptcy
and
prior
to
the
appointment
of
the
trustee
was
not
had
been
--
not
filed
prior
to
his
appointment
and
that
he
therefore
had
priority
over
the
federal
tax
lien.
the
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
the
interpretation
of
the
term
“judgment
creditor”
as
it
is
used
in
the
internal
revenue
code
from
section
6323
and
an
interpretation
of
the
powers
given
to
the
trustee
under
section
70
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
very
simple
and
are
not
in
dispute
as
they
affect
the
case.
on
june
3,
1960,
the
district
director
of
internal
revenue
assessed
withholding
tax
and
interest
in
the
amount
of
slightly
more
than
$14,000
against
the
kurtz
roofing
company.
on
that
same
day,
the
district
director
made
demand
for
the
taxes
from
taxpayer.
seventeen
days
later
on
june
20,
1960,
the
kurtz
roofing
company
filed
a
voluntary
petition
in
bankruptcy.
notice
for
the
federal
tax
lien
had
not
been
filed
prior
to
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
the
trustee
rule
that
the
united
states
was
not
a
secured
creditor
and
held
that
the
united
states
was
an
unsecured
claimant
entitled
only
to
the
fourth
priority
of
payment
under
section
64
(a)
(4)
of
the
bankruptcy
act
for
unsecured
claims
for
taxes
legally
due
and
owing.
as
a
result
of
this
holding
by
the
trustee,
although
other
secured
creditors
were
paid
in
full,
the
trustee
proposed
to
pay
on
a
pro
rata
dividend
slightly
over
53%
on
the
federal
tax
claims.
no
amounts
were
distributed
to
the
general
creditors
or
the
bankrupt.
the
section
6323
of
the
revenue
code
of
1954
provides
in
part
except
as
otherwise
provided
in
subsection
c.
the
lien
imposed
by
section
6321
shall
not
be
valid
as
against
any
mortgagee,
pledgee,
purchaser,
or
judgment
creditor
until
notice
thereof
has
been
filed
by
the
secretary
for
his
delegate.
section
70
of
the
bankruptcy
act
provides
in
part
subsection
c,
the
trustee
as
to
all
property
whether
or
not
coming
into
a
possession
for
control
of
the
court
upon
which
a
creditor
of
the
bankrupt
could
have
obtained
a
lien
by
legal
or
equitable
proceedings
at
the
time
of
the
bankruptcy
shall
be
deemed
vested
as
of
such
date
with
all
the
rights,
remedies,
and
powers
of
a
creditor,
then
holding
a
lien
thereon
by
such
proceedings
whether
or
not
such
a
creditor
actually
exists.
the
only
issue
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
the
languages
used
in
that
section
70
of
the
bankruptcy
act
makes
the
trustee
a
“judgment
creditor”
for
purposes
of
section
6323
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
in
his
--
did
it
one
time.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
it
was
1952.
i
think
it
was
in
1952.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
we
make
no
claims
with
the
change
in
language
makes
any
difference,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
right.
now,
we
submit
that
in
the
interpreting
section
70
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
there's
--
there
should
be
read
in
conjunction
with
the
language
that
is
used
in
section
70.
language
that
is
used
in
section
67
as
it
applies
to
federal
taxes
and
other
lien
holders.
by
its
terms
section
67
allows
statutory
liens
for
tax
and
debts
owing
to
the
united
states
could
be
perfected
after
bankruptcy.
section
67
states
in
part
whereby
such
laws,
such
liens
are
required
to
be
perfected
and
arise
but
are
not
perfected
before
bankruptcy.
they
may
nevertheless
be
valid
if
perfected
within
the
time
permitted
by
and
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
such
laws.
now,
under
67,
there
a
number
of
other
creditors
besides
tax
liens
holders,
who
may
perfect
their
liens
and
they
will
take
under
the
priority
set
forth.
now,
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
congress
intended
federal
taxes
--
included
federal
taxes
under
section
67
to
go
out
and
to
be
perfected
and
then
what
have
repudiated
that
by
saying
in
section
70
using
language
that
the
courts
withhold
that
the
trustee
was
a
“judgment
creditor”
because
as
the
“judgment
creditor”
you
can't
perfect
the
taxes
under
the
revenue
code.
now,
to
uphold
the
trustees'
position
in
effect
creates
two
categories
of
priorities.
one,
it
would
be
in
effect
in
a
lien
priority
contest
where
there
was
no
bankruptcy
as
many
other
cases
were
before
this
court.
and
a
different
priority
in
those
cases
where
there
is
bankruptcy
because
rule
67
allows
a
landlord,
county,
other
lien
holders
to
perfect
their
lien.
under
the
holdings
of
this
court,
those
same
lien
holders
cannot
perfect
their
lien
after
the
taxes
have
been
assessed
and
you
would
have
two
sets
of
priorities
then.
you
would
have
the
mechanics
liens
and
the
landlords,
if
there
have
been
a
bankrupt.
they
would
leap
frog
the
federal
tax
lien
because
of
the
status
given
the
trustee.
whereas
in
a
straight
lien
priority
contest
not
involving
bankruptcy,
the
federal
tax
lien
would
come
ahead.
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
congress
intended
such
a
result.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
i
beg
your
pardon?
what
invalidates
the
lien?
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
maybe
perfected.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
after
bankruptcy.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well,
if
they're
not
perfected
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
--
i
assume
they
--
they
then
remain
and
retain
the
status
of
the
general
creditor,
if
they're
not
perfected
lien
holder?
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
justice
white
in
response
to
your
question
of
what
is
--
is
there
a
provision
in
the
act
regarding
a
lien
holder
who
does
not
perfect
his
liens?
i
know
of
no
provision
in
the
act
specifically
dealing
with
the
case
where
lien
holder
fails
to
perfect
his
lien
as
he's
allowed
to
do
under
67.
but
i
think
that
it's
reasonable
that
where
he
does
fail
to
protect
his
lien
perfect
it.
he
is
no
longer
a
lien
holder
and
he
comes
in
then
as
a
general
creditor.
the
only
instance
i
can
conceive
where
he
would
fail
to
perfect
his
lien,
is
where
from
the
total
assets
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
he
has
concluded
that
there
are
prior
liens
that
have
already
been
established
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
why
doesn't
70
(c)?
well,
70
(c)
does
provide
for
the
general
creditors,
yes.
and
that's
why
i'm
saying
that
there
is
he
comes
in
then
as
a
general
creditor.
it
doesn't
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
but
he
cuts
it
out
for
the
benefit
of
the
unsecured
creditors
of
which
this
man
would
then
become
an
unsecured
creditor.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
it
would
apply
in
that
--
he
would
be
one
of
those
benefited
by
the
trustee.
yes,
but
it's
not
specifically.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes.
not
cut
it
out
entirely.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes,
it's
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
he
can
only
cut
it
out,
your
honor,
if
the
man
does
fail
to
perfect
it
himself.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
no.
but
united
states
tax
lien
ones
it's
assessed
is
a
perfected
lien.
it
doesn't
--
nothing
has
to
be
done.
i
didn't
get
notice
in
demand
which
relates
back
to
the
assessment
to
perfect
the
tax
lien.
this
court
has
held
that
it
is
a
perfected
lien
in
the
snyder
case
which
produced
the
forerunners
of
60
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
had
not
filed
a
notice
of
lien
or
not
filed
a
proof
of
claims.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
we
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
yes,
sir.
we
have
a
perfected
lien.
we're
relying
on
a
later
filing
or
notice
of
tax
lien.
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
we
did
later
file
a
notice
of
tax
lien,
yes.
what
made
us
do
that?
i
don't
know
what
made
the
district
director
do
that
in
this
instance.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well,
that
is
true
if
someone
else
came
in
with
the
real
“judgment
creditor”
after
that.
you
could
have
a
purpose
in
filing
the
notice
of
lien.
now,
it
seems
clear
that
from
the
legislative
history
of
70
(c)
and
the
changes
in
70
(c)
that
the
right's
of
the
trustee
that
congress
was
attempting
to
protect
unsecured
creditors
because
that
is
who
the
trustee
is
really
to
benefit
for
is
to
benefit
the
unsecured
creditors.
now,
in
64
(a)
and
this
case
illustrates,
even
if
you
hold
that
the
trustee
is
a
“judgment
creditor”
the
united
states
still
comes
ahead
of
the
unsecured
creditors
for
its
tax
claim
under
a
64
(a)
(4)
priority.
we
got
part
of
our
tax
claims
here.
the
unsecured
creditors
got
nothing
and
we
say
that
it's
the
language
in
70
(c)
defines
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
right
is
to
protect
the
people
who
really
adds
for
and
they're
the
unsecured
creditors.
but
if
you
read
that
to
mean
that
he
is
a
“judgment
creditor”
under
the
priority
statute
6323,
that
he
really
is
not
--
that
holding
does
not
benefit
unsecured
creditors
or
whatsoever
because
the
federal
tax
lien
then
still
comes
in
ahead
of
them
under
64
(a)
(4).
i
think
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
as
to
unsecured
claims,
yes.
as
to
secured
claims,
if
there
is
a
prior
secured
claim
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
as
to
unsecured
claims,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that
is
our
position.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that
is
correct,
your
honor
because
we
say
that
this
court
has
held
a
“judgment
creditor”
as
congress
used
that
term
in
section
6323
and
its
predecessors
to
be
a
“judgment
creditor”
in
the
conventional
sense,
that
is
one
who
has
a
judgment
court
of
record.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well,
a
“judgment
creditor”
except
for
in
several
instances,
in
the
gilbert
associates
case,
the
new
--
state
of
new
hampshire,
supreme
court
had
said
that
its
tax
lien
was
in
affect
a
judgment.
and
this
court
said
that
“judgment
creditor”
that
the
state
could
not
characterize
what
it
wanted
to
as
a
“judgment
creditor”.
that
you
use
judge
that
the
congress
had
use
“judgment
creditor”,
to
mean
a
conventional
“judgment
creditor”
is
one
who'd
obtain
the
judgment
in
the
court
of
law.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
it
did
not
your
honor
and
that
has
been
was
--
when
simonson
was
before
this
court,
the
late
justice
frankfurter
has
pointed
out
that
in
6323
and
in
the
cases
interpreting
“judgment
creditor”
that
they
had
not
considered
the
bankruptcy
act.
but
while
this
court
did
not
since
the
gilbert
associates
case
and
since
the
other
cases
that
have
come
up
interpreting
gilbert
associates
and
applying
it
to
the
bankruptcy
situation.
there
had
been
amendments
not
only
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
some
more
extensive
than
others
but
there
have
also
been
amendments
to
the
bankruptcy
act
in
1960
and
1962
and
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
say
that
those
cases
holding
the
trustee
not
to
be
a
“judgment
creditor”
within
6323
wearing
out
and
change
the
priority
either
by
amending
the
bankruptcy
act
which
they
could
do.
they
could
amend
section
70
to
provide
definitely
that
he
is
a
“judgment
creditor”
under
the
internal
revenue
laws
or
they
could
amend
6323
and
add
trustee
and
bankruptcy
to
the
four
classes
who
have
been
accepted.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes.
well,
yes,
the
relative
priority
under
other
statutory
liens
plus
the
fact
that
if
we
are
a
secured
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
now,
i
was
going
to
say,
your
honor,
plus
the
fact
that
--
our
position
is
that
if
we
are
a
secured
--
if
it
is
the
secured
lien,
we
believe
it
is
that
and
if
it's
real
property,
we
don't
have
to
really
rely
on
the
bankruptcy
court
to
establish
our
priority,
we're
ahead.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
because
there
are
some
instances
where
we
have
not
perfected.
in
the
code
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
in
the
fidelity
tube
case,
your
honor.
we
had
made
no
notice
and
demand
prior
to
bankruptcy.
we
made
that
notice
and
demand
and
that
case
held
at
filling
the
proof
of
claim
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
with
the
trustee
perfected
our
lien.
there
was
no
perfected
lien
there.
there
are
instances
being
having
the
assessment
and
not
a
perfect
lien.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
it
is
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
the
only
thing
it
would
give
us
is
as
you
can
see
from
reading
the
bankruptcy
act
itself,
it
does
not
really
go
into
priorities.
the
bankruptcy
act
does
not
go
into
who
would
perfects
his
lien
comes
first.
it
sets
out
that
certain
people
can
perfect
their
lien.
now,
it
would
give
us
the
right
if
we
perfect
our
lien
first.
we
would
say
you
would
go
back
to
the
line
of
cases
that
then
say,
you
take
first
in
time,
gets
paid
first.
and
if
we
had
a
perfected
--
if
we
had
a
lien
that
we
perfected
after
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
had
been
done
and
other
lien
holders
had
liens
that
they
perfected,
we
would
say
that
it
was
then
first
in
time.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
your
honor,
we
don't
have
to
file
our
notice
of
lien
to
perfect
our
lien.
we
have
a
perfected
lien.
the
court
held
in
snyder
that
this
was
a
perfected
lien
even
as
opposed
to
a
benefited
purchaser
who
had
no
knowledge,
the
snyder
case
was
before
the
requirements
of
filling
the
notice
of
tax
lien.
congress
enacted
the
four
runners
of
section
6323
to
protect
certain
persons.
it
didn't
enacted
saying,
we
had
no
lien
until
we
filed
our
notice
of
lien.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
there's
a
requirement
of
filing
only
to
make
the
lien
perfected
as
to
four
classes
of
persons,
a
“judgment
creditor”,
a
purchaser,
a
mortgagee,
or
a
pledgee
as
to
anyone
else,
we
have
a
perfected
lien
without
filing
of
a
notice
of
lien.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
no,
sir.
not
at
any
time.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
no,
we
can
file
it
at
any
time.
there's
no
requirement
of
time
as
to
filing
the
notice
of
tax
lien.
now,
the
congress
has
considered
several
times
amending
the
section
70
to
include
and
point
out
specifically
that
they
want
the
trustee
to
have
a
status
of
a
judgment
creditor
under
6323.
it
has
not
seen
fit
to
change
the
law.
there
have
been
numerous
cases,
other
circuit
courts,
the
other
circuit
courts
who've
considered
this
have
all
ruled
in
favor
of
the
government.
the
sixth
circuit
is
the
only
one
that
has
ruled
adverse
to
the
government's
position
here.
and
we
believe
that
where
the
courts
have
consistently
interpreted
the
statute
where
there
is
a
regulation
setting
out
the
trustee,
that
a
“judgment
creditor”
--
is
a
“judgment
creditor”
within
the
conventional
sense
as
that
term
is
used
in
6323,
that
this
court
should
not
upset
what
has
been
the
term
of
the
law
and
that
it
would
be
congressional
intent.
in
fact,
two
of
the
cases,
the
simonson
case,
the
concurring
opinion
in
simonson
and
the
majority
opinion
in
the
fidelity
tube
point
out
that
the
congress
could
change
the
law.
there
had
been
several
bills.
there
is
one
pending
notice,
passed
to
house.
it's
now
pending
in
the
senate
where
it
has
been
put
over
to
next
year
for
report
back
to
the
committee
that
would
change
the
law.
we
submit
that
the
law
that
the
circuit
court
here
misconstrued
the
congressional
intent
that
there's
no
reason
to
give
the
trustee
and
bankruptcy
the
status
of
a
“judgment
creditor”
under
6323.
