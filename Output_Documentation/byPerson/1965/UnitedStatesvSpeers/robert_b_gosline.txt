mr.
robert
b.
gosline
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
think
it
might
help
the
court
to
understand
this
case
if
we
start
where
the
present
appeal
started
and
that
is
with
the
conflict
between
the
circuits.
the
statutes
which
we
have
here
are
two
federal
statutes
and
this
case
as
we've
argued
it
to
the
court
to
the
sixth
circuit
dealt
with
the
meaning
and
relationship
between
these
two
statutes.
now,
section
6323,
section
5321
creates
what
sometimes
called
the
secret
federal
tax
lien
by
assessment
and
demand
on
the
taxpayer
alone
that
is
the
completed
perfected
lien.
that
lien,
however,
is
by
section
6323
said
to
be
not
valid
and
it
uses
the
word
valid
until
notice
is
filed
with
a
county
recorder
or
a
district
court
depending
upon
where
it
is
to
be
filed
where
the
district
director
desire
to
file.
so
that
after
assessment
and
demand,
the
simple
filing
of
a
notice
the
next
day,
the
same
day,
makes
this
lien
valid
not
only
against
the
debtor
and
most
all
unpreferred
classes
but
also
against
these
four
preferred
classes
including
the
judgment
creditor.
now,
in
this
case,
bankruptcy
--
voluntary
bankruptcy
intervened
between
the
time
of
the
assessment
and
demand
and
later
and
i
think
superfluous
filing
of
the
notice
with
the
county
recorder.
so
that
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
relying
upon
the
grant
of
section
70
(c)
said,
that
because
by
the
same
act
--
the
same
congress
which
said
a
“judgment
creditor”
is
entitled
to
freedom
from
the
secret
lien,
also
said,
that
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
shall
be
deemed
vested
with
the
rights
of
--
with
all
the
rights
of
a
lien
holder
holding
a
lien
by
legal
or
equitable
proceedings
was
by
inclusion
of
that
though
general
terms
a
“judgment
creditor”
and
his
right
was
not
subject
to
the
prior
secret
lien
of
the
federal
tax.
now,
the
controversy,
i
think,
arose
from
the
controversy
and
the
interpretation
of
section
70
(c)
and
6323
arose
from
a
decision
some
years
ago
of
this
court
in
the
gilbert
associates
case.
in
that
case,
this
court
was
confronted
with
an
interpretation
of
the
phrase
“judgment
creditor”
in
6323
and
only
that.
the
controversy
was
between
the
federal
tax
lien
and
a
local
tax
lien
in
new
hampshire,
i
believe.
and
this
court
said,
that
“judgment
creditor”
means
a
person
holding
a
judgment
of
a
court
of
record.
now,
i
don't
think
anyone
can
argue
with
that
and
we
agree
with
it.
the
next
case,
in
order
of
time,
would
be
fidelity
tube
company
case.
that
case
was
heard
en
banc
and
there
was
a
majority
opinion
and
a
dissent
and
i
think
the
division
was
something
like
four
to
two
or
five
to
two.
but
the
principal
--
the
majority
opinion
said
that
in
the
gilbert
associates
case,
the
supreme
court
said,
you
have
to
have
a
judgment
in
a
court
of
law.
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
does
not
have
a
judgment
in
the
court
of
law.
therefore,
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
is
not
a
judgment
creditor
within
6323.
in
rather
inconsistent
situation
--
discussion,
the
majority
went
on
to
say
that
congress
could
amend
this
section
70
(c)
to
say
that
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
would
be
a
“judgment
creditor”.
now,
the
dissent
in
that
case
is
a
careful
consideration
of
this
question
and
in
the
dissent
judge
kalodner
said,
that
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
should
not
be
considered
a
“judgment
creditor”
for
one
purpose
and
not
for
other
purposes
because
section
70
(c)
is
broad
in
its
statement
and
said,
that
he
shall
have
all
the
rights
of
a
creditor
holding
a
lien
by
legal
or
equitable
proceedings.
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
words
of
section
70
(c)
were
general
and
broad
enough
to
cover
the
elements
which
made
up
a
‘judgment
creditor”.
certainly,
a
creditor
holding
a
lien
by
judicial
proceedings,
as
anyone
would
ordinarily
interpret
it,
include
the
“judgment
creditor”.
he
suggested
in
the
majority
or
the
majority
opinion
suggested
that
if
congress
did
amend
the
law
to
include
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
as
a
“judgment
creditor”,
it
would
solve
the
problem.
now,
this
is
inconsistent
with
the
original
position
that
under
the
gilbert
associates
case,
there
can
only
be
a
“judgment
creditor”
who
has
judgment
by
a
court
of
law.
and
i
think
that
that
is
one
of
the
keys
to
the
efficiency
in
the
government
position
here.
they
admit
in
their
brief
the
congress
has
the
power
to
grant
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
the
status
of
a
“judgment
creditor”
but
yet
they
say
that
only
first
holding
a
judgment
in
the
court
of
law
can
have
that
position.
those
two
are
inconsistent
and
cannot
be
resolved.
they
say
leave
it
up
to
the
congress
to
change
it.
i
think
that
that's
not
necessary
because
the
congress
has
already
stated
in
the
present
70
(c)
which
was
decided
--
which
was
amended
in
1952
that
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
has
these
rights.
mr.
robert
b.
gosline
that's
correct.
that's
--
mr.
robert
b.
gosline
well,
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that
the
government
can
perfect
the
lien
under
6323
after
the
date
of
bankruptcy
and
that
is
the
67
(b)
discussion.
mr.
robert
b.
gosline
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
when
you
read
it
with
6323
because
6323
says
that
--
mr.
robert
b.
gosline
no,
both,
because
6323
says
that
in
the
federal
tax
lien
shall
not
be
valid
until
--
mr.
robert
b.
gosline
until,
so
that
there
is
no
--
if
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
is
a
“judgment
creditor”
there
is
no
validity
in
your
federal
tax
lien
until
the
filing.
mr.
robert
b.
gosline
so
that
if
a
filing
is
subsequent
to
the
date
of
bankruptcy,
the
rights
of
the
trustee
will
always
be
prior
to
your
date
of
validity
--
mr.
robert
b.
gosline
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
what
67
(b)
refers
to
is
a
situation
--
mr.
robert
b.
gosline
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
there
is
no
time
limit.
he
would
--
he
would
win
freedom
from
tremendous
confusion.
there's
no
time
limit
on
the
time
within
which
the
notice
can
be
filed.
now,
normally
with
the
mechanic's
lien
or
some
of
the
other
statutory
lien,
the
filing
has
to
be
within
20
days.
mr.
robert
b.
gosline
within
60
days
in
the
case
of
ohio
mechanic's
lien,
so
that
if
67
(b)
has
given
affect
in
that
situation,
you
have
a
cut-off
period
within
which
you
know
that
there
will
be
no
more
filings
under
67
(b).
with
this
case
with
an
unlimited
time,
if
you
are
going
to
consider
6323
under
67
(b)
you
might
complete
your
bankruptcy,
sell
all
your
property
and
distribute
the
proceeds,
have
a
filing
subsequently
and
have
the
bankruptcy
reopened
again
because
the
lien
which
was
filed
under
6323
is
then
claimed
at
being
perfected.
mr.
robert
b.
gosline
i
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor.
i
may
be
incorrect
on
that
but
i
didn't
think
it
did.
i
thought
it
referred
to
state
statutory
liens.
mr.
robert
b.
gosline
statutory
lien.
mr.
robert
b.
gosline
well,
your
honor,
then
my
answer
to
this
line
of
argument
goes
back
to
6323.
it
says,
it
is
not
valid
until
the
notice
is
filed.
there
is
no
relation
back,
no
retroactive
effect
of
the
filing
of
that
notice
so
that
it
is
not
valid
until
the
notice
is
filed.
mr.
robert
b.
gosline
no.
mr.
robert
b.
gosline
well,
this
is
important
and
i'm
happy
to
address
myself
to
it.
i
don't
read
67
(b)
out
of
it.
but
i
read
67
(b)
as
in
relation
to
the
limitation
that
the
filing
of
notice
the
federal
tax
lien
is
operative
until
it
is
filed
and
that
the
right
of
the
trustee
at
the
date
of
bankruptcy,
so
that
the
date
of
bankruptcy
will
always
in
your
assumption
precede
the
operative
debate
of
section
6323
and
that
--
mr.
robert
b.
gosline
that's
correct,
your
honor.
validity,
and
the
word
until
so
that
no
--
as
far
--
if
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
or
the
“judgment
creditor”.
mr.
robert
b.
gosline
yes,
i
think
that
would
be
--
mr.
robert
b.
gosline
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
gosline
it's
a
broader
language
than
that.
but
otherwise,
the
trustee
would
be
confronted
with
an
unlimited
possibility
of
filing
and
with
an
indeterminate
situation
in
the
bankruptcy
administration.
i'll
move
back
briefly
to
the
opinion
of
the
sixth
circuit,
that
was
written
by
judge
sullivan
and
it
states
in
very
succinct
and
precise
terms,
the
position
on
which
we
basically
rely
and
that
is
that
the
congress
had
the
right
to
give
this
exemption
to
“judgment
creditor”.
the
congress
also
have
the
power
to
define
who
would
be
considered
a
“judgment
creditor”
and
in
section
70
(c),
congress
had
given
that
definition
and
broaden
up
terms
so
that
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
as
judge
sullivan
quote
as
clearly
his
words
can
state
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
is
entitled
to
all
of
the
rights
of
a
“judgment
creditor”
although,
obviously,
he
is
not
one
and
that
language
he
quoted
from
the
concurring
opinion
of
judge
hamley
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
other
conflict
case
of
simonson
versus
granquist.
the
government
has
relied
upon
the
committee
report
in
recent
years
and
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
comment
on
those
very
briefly.
we
have
--
they
have
quoted
committee
reports
of
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
and
we
have
quoted
committee
report
to
the
senate
finance
committee
of
the
committee
report
of
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
and
the
senate
finance
committee
which
were
dealing
with
section
6323
and
those
committees
are
of
course
in
favor
of
a
strict
construction
of
a
“judgment
creditor”
in
aid
of
the
collection
of
taxes.
we
have
relied
upon
reports
of
the
bankruptcy
subcommittee
of
the
house
judiciary
committee
and
of
the
senate
judiciary
committee.
these
reports
are
considering
the
status
of
the
trustee
and
the
efficiency
of
the
operation
of
the
bankruptcy
procedures
and
they
are
in
favor
of
expanding
the
rights
of
the
bankruptcy
trustee.
these
committee
statements,
i
think,
have
to
be
somewhat
of
a
stand
off
and
the
legislative
history
which
has
had
in
this
statutes
since
about
1910,
a
provision
that
trustee
and
bankruptcy
shall
be
considered
as
if
you
were
a
“judgment
creditor”
as
well
as
the
present
form
which
grants
to
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
rights
well
beyond
those
of
a
“judgment
creditor”
because
in
some
states
and
in
particular
in
ohio,
a
“judgment
creditor”
is
not
a
lien
holder
until
a
certificate
of
judgment
is
filed
or
until
a
levy
of
execution
is
filed,
so
that
the
rights
of
a
“judgment
creditor”
in
ohio
are
substantially
less
than
the
rights
of
a
creditor
holding
a
lien
by
legal
or
equitable
proceedings.
government
makes
reference
to
the
practical
effect
of
the
ruling
and
of
the
statute
and
makes
the
point
that
in
this
case,
the
government
was
not
treated
as
an
unsecured
creditor.
and
i
think
in
that,
he
falls
in
the
error
of
distinguishing
between
priority
unsecured
creditors
and
unsecured
creditors
which
have
no
priority.
now,
state
and
federal
taxes
are
given
a
priority
over
other
unsecured
creditors
under
64
(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
result
is
that
in
this
case
the
federal
government
shared
with
the
state
taxing
agencies
in
the
dividend
which
was
proposed,
the
53%
dividend,
and
that
represents
just
exactly
what
the
purpose
of
section
70
(c)
is
and
that
is
to
bring
the
right
of
an
unsecured
creditor
ahead
of
a
creditor
claiming
a
secret
lien.
i
think
with
respect
to
the
practical
effects,
we
always
come
down
to
the
very
simple
answer,
that
the
only
thing
that
the
government
has
to
do
to
protect
itself
completely
in
this
type
of
situation
is
to
file
its
notice
and
when
that
notice
is
filed
mortgagees,
pledgees,
judgment
creditors,
trustee
in
bankruptcy
are
all
subsequent
in
their
priority
to
the
federal
tax
lien.
i
think,
probably,
the
arguments
in
favor
of
trustees'
position
as
the
“judgment
creditors”
are
fully
summarized
in
judge
sullivan's
opinion,
it
is
brief
and
it
is
precise.
they
also
summarized
the
memorandum
of
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
which
is
in
the
record
and
the
word
of
the
two
statutes,
i
believe,
are
clear
and
unambiguous
and
don't
require
any
resort
to
legislative
history
comparisons
to
practical
effect
or
other
collateral
sources.
but
proper
construction
is
possible
from
a
simple
reading
of
their
provisions.
perhaps
the
heart
of
the
argument
here
is
the
power
of
congress
to
define
the
word
“judgment
creditor”
to
include
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
we
believe
that
the
government
concedes
this
power,
that
this
power
was
exercised
in
70
(c)
and
70
(c)
defines
the
trustee
as
the
statutory
“judgment
creditor”.
with
these
reasons
which
are
set
out
in
the
publications
that
are
on
file,
we
believe
that
the
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
should
properly
be
affirmed
in
preference
to
the
conflict
cases.
thank
you,
your
honor.
