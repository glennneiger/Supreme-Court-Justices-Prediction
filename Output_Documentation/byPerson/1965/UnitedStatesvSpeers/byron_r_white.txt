what
invalidates
the
lien
if
this
affected
those
other
statutory
liens?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
under
67,
you
said
the
liens
may
be
valid
--
may
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
after
bankruptcy.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
they
aren't?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
with
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
what
provision.
well,
later
you
can
answer
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
doesn't
70
(c)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
the
trustees
cut
out
the
lien
and
practically
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
do
you
think
that
would
see
its
relevance
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
that
would
apply
the
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
trustee
would
have
the
power
to
really
cut
this,
(inaudible)
cut
out
the
lien.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
understand.
they
could
cut
out
the
lien.
justice
byron
r.
white
lien
holders
are
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
do
you
say
that
united
states
tax
lien
is
assessed.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
or
filed,
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
made
us
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
get
from
the
commission,
if
they
are
going
to
upheld
that
you
wouldn't
get
if
you
had
a
right
as
you
do
as
a
trustee,
your
perfected
lien
(inaudible)
is
that
your
relative
priority
in
effectuating
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
have
to
--
you
never
have
to
tax
the
lien
and
had
to
require
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
67
(b)
wouldn't
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
didn't
hear?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
stated
in
this
case,
in
this
instant
case,
your
argument
is
to
the
effect
(inaudible)
doesn't
give
you
a
credit?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gosline,
i
think
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
bankruptcy
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
in
the
normal
case,
what
--
what
would
the
trustee
get
by
winning
this
case?
what
would
the
usual
trustee
--
when
the
government
could
perfect
its
lien
against
him
under
67
(b)?
justice
byron
r.
white
67
(b)
says
it
can?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
70
(c)
to
control
6323
but
not
67
(b)?
justice
byron
r.
white
until?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
section
67
(b)
says
expressly
that
nevertheless
it's
valid
against
the
trustee.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
--
let
us
assume
for
a
minute
that
67
(b)
did
say
that.
that
--
that
the
federal
government
may
nevertheless
file
its
lien
and
perfected
against
the
trustee
after
bankruptcy.
let's
assume
that
for
the
moment.
then
normally
the
trustee
wouldn't
--
a
normal
trustee
wouldn't
win
much
by
winning
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
67
--
67
(b)
does
express
from
this
in
the
federal
statute
or
the
federal
tax
lien?
justice
byron
r.
white
including
liens
for
taxes
going
to
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
67
--
you
just
read
67
(b)
out
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
go
ahead.
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
emphasis
on
the
validity
part
of
that
argument?
