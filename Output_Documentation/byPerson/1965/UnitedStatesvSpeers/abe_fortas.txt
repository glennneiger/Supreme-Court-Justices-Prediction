justice
abe
fortas
do
you
--
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
do
you
construe
the
law
as
meaning
that
a
trustee
is
a
“judgment
creditor”
and
has
a
status
has
say
as
if
he
were
a
“judgment
creditor”
with
respect
to
all
private
claimants?
forget
about
united
states
and
the
tax
lien
now
under
70
(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
is
the
trustee
a
“judgment
creditor”
with
respect
all
other
types
of
claims?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
--
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well
here,
the
trustee
is
a
“judgment
creditor”
for
whatever
that
may
mean.
with
respect
to
everybody
except
the
united
states
tax
liens,
is
that
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
the
tax
lien
--
that
is
it.
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
somehow
we
ought
to
read
6323
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
70
(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
act
together.
so
as
to
come
out
with
the
result
that
70
(c)
is
subject
to
an
exception
that
is
to
say.
that
under
70
(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
trustee
has
a
status
of
a
“judgment
creditor”
with
respect
to
everybody
except
the
united
states
tax
lien
even
if
that
tax
lien
has
not
been
filed.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you're
asking
that
“judgment
creditor”
in
6323
(a)
being
construed
so
as
to
mean
“judgment
creditor”
except
for
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy?
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
did
not
expressly
--
this
court
did
not
expressly
pass
it
on
whether
in
the
gilbert
associates
on
whether
“judgment
creditor”
the
purposes
of
6323
(a)
did
or
did
not
include
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy?
