justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
if
a
--
if
this
hill
incident
had
never
been
in
the
newspapers,
had
never
been
made
public,
the
only
people
who
knew
about
it
were
the
neighbors
and
the
convicts
and
the
hill's,
never
been
a
matter
of
public
interest
or
an
object
to
news
before
that
the
same
thing
could
have
happened,
the
time
magazine
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
the
import
of
the
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
--
do
you
mean
that
--
you
mean
then
that
life
or
time
could
not
just
decide
that
a
very
interesting
thing
is
the
life
of
an
ordinary
government
official
--
a
government
worker
or
an
ordinary
industrial
worker
and
follow
him
around
against
his
consent
for
a
week
and
write
up
every
detail
of
his
life.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you
had
a
--
if
you've
got
enough
good
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
in
my
example.
the
perfectly
good
sound
reason
is
that
by
instincts,
everybody
would
be
interested
in
what
the
ordinary
life
of
a
steel
worker's
life.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
well
be
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could
well
be
what?
does
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
--
and
i
wouldn't
suggest
that
they
had
even
intruded.
they
just
followed
him
around,
recorded
what
ballgames
he
went
to
or
what
boy
scout
troops
he
visited
or
what
taverns
he
went
into
or
things
like
that
just
to
--
and
ordinarily,
wouldn't
think
was
a
news
worthy
event
but
nevertheless,
the
make
it
if
they
want
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
--
so
what
--
you
really
do
mean
it
then
you
don't
draw
any
line
between
the
public
figure
or
--
and
the
private
figure
or
between
a
newsworthy
event
or
a
non-newsworthy
event.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
--
once
somebody
has
made
it
public
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
like
a
newspaper.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
nixon,
could
i
ask
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
comes
to
us
in
that
posture,
are
we
to
understand
that
new
york
does
not
draw
a
distinction
for
purposes
of
liability
of
the
privacy
law
between
stories
about
past
events
which
are
false
or
which
are
knowingly
false
and
stories
which
are
not
known
to
be
false
at
the
time
they're
published
but
actually
are
false.
let's
assume
here
for
example
that
the
author
had
told
the
life
reporter
that
it
is
a
true
enactment.
or
in
other
words
the
life
reporter
really
had
no
good
reason
to
believe
otherwise.
new
york,
i
suppose,
under
its
rule
would
impose
liability
whether
life
knew
the
story
was
false
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
know
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
as
the
new
york
statute
comes
to
us
however,
it
would
cover
the
situation
where
the
story
about
the
past
event
was
false
but
it
was
only
negligently
false
for
example
or
we
might
say
that
it
was
an
excusable
error
but
it
was
nevertheless
false.
you
would
say
new
york
would
impose
liability
in
that
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
suggesting
it
to
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
under
the
cases
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
this
court
that
sometimes
statutes
have
been
invalidated
because
they're
overbroad
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
the
first
amendment
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
fiction
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
nixon,
the
way
you
tell
us
about
the
--
present
this
new
york
statute
is
just
as
though
new
york
statute
as
--
that
new
york
has
a
law
which
--
although
labeled
as
privacy
is
really
a
law
which
gives
a
remedy
for
an
intentional
falsehood
for
gain
entitlement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
adversary
said
in
his
argument
that
he
wouldn't
have
any
doubt
that
constitutionally
a
state
could
give
a
remedy
for
intentional
torts
like
telling
a
deliberate
lie
about
a
person
who
is
damaged
and
it
sounds
as
though,
although
new
york
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
calls
this
a
law
of
privacy
as
i
understand
you,
there
is
a
--
the
--
this
is
almost
what
this
new
york
law
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
knowing
falsehood
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense
in
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
a
rather
--
rather
obvious
difference
though
as
if
they're
--
would
you
claim
there's
really
something
newsworthy
about
mrs.
blumenthal?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
let's
just
carry
out
your
point
but
what's
newsworthy
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
could
you
say
there's
a
major
difference
between
those
two
pictures
you
showed
us
in
the
newspaper
and
mrs.
blumenthal
in
purpose
of
newsworthiness?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
agree
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
agree
or
not,
in
terms
of
newsworthiness?
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
does
--
if
six
seconds
of
mrs.
blumenthal's
life
was
newsworthy
so
with
two
hours,
i
suppose
be.
and
if
they
followed
her
around
for
two
or
three
hours
or
two
or
three
days
or
two
or
three
weeks
and
made
a
travel
log
of
mrs.
blumenthal,
i
suppose
you
would
say
the
same
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
don't
want
to
answer
it.[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
prevent
negligent
falsity
either
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
you
wouldn't
prevent
recovery
for
negligent
falsehood.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
really
aren't
talking
much
about
a
public
fact
if
you
--
if
you
state
a
non-fact,
are
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it's
false
--
if
it's
false
is
not
about
a
public
fact,
no
fact
at
all.
and
--
so
how
do
you
get
around
in
saying
that
--
that's
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
negligent
falsity?
do
you
think
it's
true
or
it
isn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
recklessness?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
were
proper
instructions.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
medina,
the
trial
court
might
have
refused
to
give
this
instruction
because
it
already
instructed
over
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
going
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
whether
there
was
fictionalization,
whatever
you
call
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
fictionalized
in
itself
means
--
meant
to
the
jury
or
means
by
the
law
of
new
york
that
a
person
deliberately
falsify
or
deliberately
fictionalize
that
word
in
and
of
itself,
carries
that
import
why,
perhaps,
this
--
this
law
is
put
in
a
different
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
is
what
you
--
that
the
jury
had
to
find
--
find
this
fiction
to
award
compensatory
damages,
what
they
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
they
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
they
have
to
find
to
report
punitive
damage.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now,
the
jury
awarded
punitive
damages.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
in
this
case,
how
can
you
really
complain
if
the
--
if
the
jury
--
the
jury
was
instructed
on
both
compensatory
and
punitive
damages,
compensatory
or
near
view
only
--
required
only
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you'd
say
that
punitive
damage
thing
is
out
of
this
case,
does
it
come
to
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
has
never
been
any
--
there
has
never
been
any
review
of
--
of
whether
or
not
the
--
the
jury
verdict
was
sustainable
on
punitive
damages.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
only
the
compensatory
damage
matters
appeared?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
any
--
and
in
any
event
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
instruction
of
punitive
damages,
that's
what
i'm
referring
to
--
to
satisfy
you
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
allows
recovery
on
negligence.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
not
intentional,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
it's
neither
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
can
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
can
be
--
it
can
be
fiction
even
if
they
intended
--
but
it
can
also
be
fiction
even
if
they
don't,
is
that
your
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
--
even
if
we
didn't
agree
that
it
applied
to
truthful
statements.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
still
state
it
on
its
face
is
bad
because
it
applies
to
false
statements
but
you
didn't
know
were
false.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
we
read
new
york
cases
as
construing
that
statute
not
to
cover
truthful
statements,
no
matter
what
the
purpose
for
the
publication
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
--
if
we
construed
the
statute
as
to
the
cases
that
way,
then
the
statute
would
be
construed
that
way
but
you
would
still
say
that
it's
bad
on
its
face
because
it
still
covers
negligently
false
statements
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
as
applied
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
just
really
saying
that
there's
really
important
privacy
there
is
--
there
are
just
intents
of
tort.
it's
the
intentional
invasions
of
--
of
somebody's
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that's
--
that
the
intent
part
of
it
meant
that
there
are
knowledge
knowing
that
there's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
knowing
falsehood.
is
it
wrapped
up
in
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
that
basis,
you
can
get
punitive
damages
in
new
york,
one
including
negligence
that
would
take
intention
to
get
to
that
situation.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
the
latter
part.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
could
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
could
have
liability
here
though,
under
this
construction
without
finding
recklessness.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
have
liability
without
recklessness
under
this
construction
if
you
found
just
ill
will.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
event,
the
punitive
damage
--
the
requirements
of
punitive
damages
are
no
more
severe
than
for
compensatory
damages.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
this
was
really
surplusage
of
the
whole
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
doctrine.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
judgment
of
punitive
damages
is
out
of
the
case.
that's
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
though
--
we
though
--
what
if
we
said
that
it
was
and
or
that
we
ought
to
find
out.
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
told
us,
you
still
have
the
instructions
probably
on
the
problem,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
--
doesn't
still
handle
all
the
problems
in
the
case
to
remand
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
--
even
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
mr.
medina,
really,
you
--
when
you
say
that
certainly
you
should
be
liable
if
it
is
assumed
that
this
story
was
false
and
that
you
knew
it,
you
don't
mean
to
say
that
if
we
could
glean
from
this
record
that
--
or
that
we
thought
from
an
examination
of
the
record
that
it
was
false
and
that
you
knew
it,
that
wouldn't
--
that
wouldn't
end
up
in
liability
if
you
knew
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you'd
still
have
to
because
the
case,
if
--
if
you
also
thought
that
the
--
that
the
jury
was
not
instructed
this
way,
why
the
case
wasn't
tried
on
that
theory.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
if
a
--
if
this
hill
incident
had
never
been
in
the
newspapers,
had
never
been
made
public,
the
only
people
who
knew
about
it
were
the
neighbors
and
the

and
the
hill's,
never
been
a
matter
of
public
interest
or
an
object
to
news
before
that
the
same
thing
could
have
happened,
the
time
magazine
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
the
import
of
the
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
--
do
you
mean
that
--
you
mean
then
that
life
or
time
could
not
just
decide
that
a
very
interesting
thing
is
the
life
of
an
ordinary
government
official
--
a
government
worker
or
an
ordinary
industrial
worker
and
follow
him
around
against
his
consent
for
a
week
and
write
up
every
detail
of
his
life.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you
had
a
--
if
you've
got
enough
good
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
in
my
example.
the
perfectly
good
sound
reason
is
that
by
instincts,
everybody
would
be
interested
in
what
the
ordinary
life
of
a
steel
worker's
life.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
well
be
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could
well
be
what?
does
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
--
and
i
wouldn't
suggest
that
they
had
even
intruded.
they
just
followed
him
around,
recorded
what
ballgames
he
went
to
or
what
boy
scout
troops
he
visited
or
what
taverns
he
went
into
or
things
like
that
just
to
--
and
ordinarily,
wouldn't
think
was
a
news
worthy
event
but
nevertheless,
the
make
it
if
they
want
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
do
--
so
what
--
you
really
do
mean
it
then
you
don't
draw
any
line
between
the
public
figure
or
--
and
the
private
figure
or
between
a
newsworthy
event
or
a
non-newsworthy
event.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
--
once
somebody
has
made
it
public
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
like
a
newspaper.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
nixon,
could
i
ask
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
comes
to
us
in
that
posture,
are
we
to
understand
that
new
york
does
not
draw
a
distinction
for
purposes
of
liability
of
the
privacy
law
between
stories
about
past
events
which
are
false
or
which
are
knowingly
false
and
stories
which
are
not
known
to
be
false
at
the
time
they're
published
but
actually
are
false.
let's
assume
here
for
example
that
the
author
had
told
the
life
reporter
that
it
is
a
true
enactment.
or
in
other
words
the
life
reporter
really
had
no
good
reason
to
believe
otherwise.
new
york,
i
suppose,
under
its
rule
would
impose
liability
whether
life
knew
the
story
was
false
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
know
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
as
the
new
york
statute
comes
to
us
however,
it
would
cover
the
situation
where
the
story
about
the
past
event
was
false
but
it
was
only
negligently
false
for
example
or
we
might
say
that
it
was
an
excusable
error
but
it
was
nevertheless
false.
you
would
say
new
york
would
impose
liability
in
that
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
suggesting
it
to
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
under
the
cases
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
this
court
that
sometimes
statutes
have
been
invalidated
because
they're
overbroad
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
the
first
amendment
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
fiction
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
nixon,
the
way
you
tell
us
about
the
--
present
this
new
york
statute
is
just
as
though
new
york
statute
as
--
that
new
york
has
a
law
which
--
although
labeled
as
privacy
is
really
a
law
which
gives
a
remedy
for
an
intentional
falsehood
for
gain
entitlement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
adversary
said
in
his
argument
that
he
wouldn't
have
any
doubt
that
constitutionally
a
state
could
give
a
remedy
for
intentional
torts
like
telling
a
deliberate
lie
about
a
person
who
is
damaged
and
it
sounds
as
though,
although
new
york
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
calls
this
a
law
of
privacy
as
i
understand
you,
there
is
a
--
the
--
this
is
almost
what
this
new
york
law
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
knowing
falsehood
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense
in
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
a
rather
--
rather
obvious
difference
though
as
if
they're
--
would
you
claim
there's
really
something
newsworthy
about
mrs.
blumenthal?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
let's
just
carry
out
your
point
but
what's
newsworthy
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
could
you
say
there's
a
major
difference
between
those
two
pictures
you
showed
us
in
the
newspaper
and
mrs.
blumenthal
in
purpose
of
newsworthiness?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
agree
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
agree
or
not,
in
terms
of
newsworthiness?
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
does
--
if
six
seconds
of
mrs.
blumenthal's
life
was
newsworthy
so
with
two
hours,
i
suppose
be.
and
if
they
followed
her
around
for
two
or
three
hours
or
two
or
three
days
or
two
or
three
weeks
and
made
a
travel
log
of
mrs.
blumenthal,
i
suppose
you
would
say
the
same
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
don't
want
to
answer
it.[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
prevent
negligent
falsity
either
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
you
wouldn't
prevent
recovery
for
negligent
falsehood.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
really
aren't
talking
much
about
a
public
fact
if
you
--
if
you
state
a
non-fact,
are
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it's
false
--
if
it's
false
is
not
about
a
public
fact,
no
fact
at
all.
and
--
so
how
do
you
get
around
in
saying
that
--
that's
protected
by
the
first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
negligent
falsity?
do
you
think
it's
true
or
it
isn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
recklessness?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
were
proper
instructions.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
medina,
the
trial
court
might
have
refused
to
give
this
instruction
because
it
already
instructed
over
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
going
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
whether
there
was
fictionalization,
whatever
you
call
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
fictionalized
in
itself
means
--
meant
to
the
jury
or
means
by
the
law
of
new
york
that
a
person
deliberately
falsify
or
deliberately
fictionalize
that
word
in
and
of
itself,
carries
that
import
why,
perhaps,
this
--
this
law
is
put
in
a
different
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
is
what
you
--
that
the
jury
had
to
find
--
find
this
fiction
to
award
compensatory
damages,
what
they
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
they
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
they
have
to
find
to
report
punitive
damage.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now,
the
jury
awarded
punitive
damages.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
in
this
case,
how
can
you
really
complain
if
the
--
if
the
jury
--
the
jury
was
instructed
on
both
compensatory
and
punitive
damages,
compensatory
or
near
view
only
--
required
only
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you'd
say
that
punitive
damage
thing
is
out
of
this
case,
does
it
come
to
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
has
never
been
any
--
there
has
never
been
any
review
of
--
of
whether
or
not
the
--
the
jury
verdict
was
sustainable
on
punitive
damages.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
only
the
compensatory
damage
matters
appeared?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
any
--
and
in
any
event
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
instruction
of
punitive
damages,
that's
what
i'm
referring
to
--
to
satisfy
you
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
allows
recovery
on
negligence.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
not
intentional,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
it's
neither
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
can
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
can
be
--
it
can
be
fiction
even
if
they
intended
--
but
it
can
also
be
fiction
even
if
they
don't,
is
that
your
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
--
even
if
we
didn't
agree
that
it
applied
to
truthful
statements.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
still
state
it
on
its
face
is
bad
because
it
applies
to
false
statements
but
you
didn't
know
were
false.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
we
read
new
york
cases
as
construing
that
statute
not
to
cover
truthful
statements,
no
matter
what
the
purpose
for
the
publication
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
--
if
we
construed
the
statute
as
to
the
cases
that
way,
then
the
statute
would
be
construed
that
way
but
you
would
still
say
that
it's
bad
on
its
face
because
it
still
covers
negligently
false
statements
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
as
applied
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
just
really
saying
that
there's
really
important
privacy
there
is
--
there
are
just
intents
of
tort.
it's
the
intentional
invasions
of
--
of
somebody's
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that's
--
that
the
intent
part
of
it
meant
that
there
are
knowledge
knowing
that
there's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
knowing
falsehood.
is
it
wrapped
up
in
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
that
basis,
you
can
get
punitive
damages
in
new
york,
one
including
negligence
that
would
take
intention
to
get
to
that
situation.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
the
latter
part.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
could
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
could
have
liability
here
though,
under
this
construction
without
finding
recklessness.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
have
liability
without
recklessness
under
this
construction
if
you
found
just
ill
will.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
event,
the
punitive
damage
--
the
requirements
of
punitive
damages
are
no
more
severe
than
for
compensatory
damages.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
this
was
really
surplusage
of
the
whole
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
doctrine.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
judgment
of
punitive
damages
is
out
of
the
case.
that's
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
though
--
we
though
--
what
if
we
said
that
it
was
and
or
that
we
ought
to
find
out.
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
told
us,
you
still
have
the
instructions
probably
on
the
problem,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
--
doesn't
still
handle
all
the
problems
in
the
case
to
remand
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
--
even
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
mr.
medina,
really,
you
--
when
you
say
that
certainly
you
should
be
liable
if
it
is
assumed
that
this
story
was
false
and
that
you
knew
it,
you
don't
mean
to
say
that
if
we
could
glean
from
this
record
that
--
or
that
we
thought
from
an
examination
of
the
record
that
it
was
false
and
that
you
knew
it,
that
wouldn't
--
that
wouldn't
end
up
in
liability
if
you
knew
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you'd
still
have
to
because
the
case,
if
--
if
you
also
thought
that
the
--
that
the
jury
was
not
instructed
this
way,
why
the
case
wasn't
tried
on
that
theory.
