justice
potter
stewart
mr.
hill
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
was
(voice

at
all
nor
was
anybody
in
his
family?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
they
--
whether
or
not
it's
a
tenuous
relationship,
it's
basically
a
matter
of
fact
and
on
that
matter,
on
that
issue
of
fact,
the
members
of
the
new
york
courts
disagreed
but
the
majority
thought
that
it
was
not
a
relevant
relationship
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
was
the
issue
which
divided
the
new
york
courts,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
that's
what
you
told
us
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
judge
botein
dissented
upon.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
now
as
i
understand
the
--
section
50
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
libel,
it
has
to
do
with
the
appropriation
and
use
of
another
person's
name
or
picture
without
that
person's
consent
for
commercial
purposes
or
for
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
trade
or
advertising
purposes
and
that's
the
extent
of
the
statute
in
whether
or
not
these
facts
come
within
the
statute
was
a
matter
for
the
new
york
courts
to
decide
and
their
having
decided
it,
we
must
take
that
as
is
and
all
you
have
here
is
the
constitutional
question.
i
think
we
have
all
agree
on
that,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
the
financing
of
this
story
came
from
the
producers
of
the
play,
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
some
of
that
part
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
primarily
--
but
the
--
isn't
it
--
that
a
part
of
it
come
from
(inaudible)
of
the
play?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
they
were
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
interested
in
making
money
for
the
play,
weren't
they
in
attracting
publicity
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
therefore
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
again.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
necessarily
true
--
justice
potter
stewart
no.
well,
let's
suppose
life
magazine
decided
that
they'd
make
a
feature
of
how
the
ordinary
man
and
wife
go
to
bed
every
night
and
they
put
a
telescopic
camera
or
tried
at
the
window
of
a
--
some
marital
bedroom
and
they
took
a
lot
of
pictures
and
printed
that
as
a
feature.
that
wouldn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
make
news.
that
would
probably
sell
copies
of
the
magazine,
wouldn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
its
only
be
if
in
fact
the
falsity
were
in
a
defamatory
sense,
that
probably
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
on

i
think.
justice

stewart
yes,
it

justice
potter
stewart
page
292,
the
charge
begins
and
--
justice
potter
stewart

it
goes
over
to
307.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
one
they
made
kind
of
a
comedy
out
of,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
those
are
probably
the
dissenting
members
of
the
court
or
the

justice

stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
