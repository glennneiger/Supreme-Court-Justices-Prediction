why
do
you

chief

press
conference
as
were
used
was
a
different
conference
(voice

--
chief

but
if
the
press
descends
upon
a
man's
home
and
he
agrees
to
talk
to
them
and
they
urge
him
to
talk

do
you
call

yes.
chief

may
i
ask
you
--
may
i
ask
you
mr.

if
there
was
anything
in
the
book
that
indicated
that
this
did
go
out,
that
incident?
chief

so,
the

have
no

(voice

oh,
alright.
chief

earl
warren
go

chief

did

check

chief

may
i
ask
you
what
research
your
researcher
made
to
determine
the
truth
about
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this?
well,
is
there
any
question
about
whether
there
is
a
difference
between
the
play
and
the
article
that
life
wrote?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
no
difference
between
the
--
either
the
book
and
life's
article
or
the
play
in
life's
article.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
--
with
the
play
then.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
suggest
that
if
there
was
publicity
concerning
some
event
in
a
person's
life
particularly
when
he
had
done
nothing
wrong
that
a
publication
could
follow
him
every
place
he
went
in
the
country
and
over
a
period
of
years,
dig
that
up
to
his
detriment
and
published
it
on
the
faces
of
his
news.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
--
don't
know.
this
don't
say
what
you're
treating
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
there,
would
you
answer
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
well,
if
you
couldn't
--
if
a
publication
couldn't
do
it,
what
would
it
be
violating?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
we
--
no,
we're
not
talking
about
falsehood
now.
you
put
that
behind
you.
you
said
that
made
no
difference
and
i
was
so
considering
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
assume
even
that
it
was
true,
originally,
can
they
follow
him
around
the
country
and
that
--
and
when
he
tries
to
forget
it
and
have
his
family
forget
it,
can
they
keep
publishing
it
on
him
to
his
detriment
wherever
he
goes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
concede
here
that
they
knew
it
was
going
to
cause
harm
or
that
it
did
cause
harm?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
one
question,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
just
before
you
get
to
that.
according
to
your
theory,
do
you
make
any
distinction
between
a
so-called
public
fact
as
you
have
stated
it
where
it
concerns
a
private
person
or
on
the
other
hand
a
person
in
public
life
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
makes
no
difference.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
nixon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
get
that.
would
you
repeat
what
--
the
caption
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
nixon,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
suppose
that
life
instead
of
doing
this
the
way
it
did,
said
that
this
play
of
mr.
hughes
is
reminiscent
of
the
hill
incident
in
philadelphia
which
we
recalled
to
be
as
follows.
and
they
then
proceed
to
revive
the
story
substantially
as
it
occurred.
would
you
say
that
no
matter
how
sensitive
these
people
were
to
their
privacy,
no
matter
how
hard
they
had
tried
to
get
away
from
reliving
this
thing
that
that
would
be
appropriate
and
life
could
do
that
without
violating
your
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
mr.
nixon
that
we
didn't
consider
that
the
fictionalization
of
the
article
was
the
crux
of
the
constitutional
question,
how
would
you
answer
the
question
that
i
first
put
to
you.
would
you
think
that
involved
the
first
amendment
rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
exactly,
yes,
exactly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
us
take
the

chief

chief

he
wrote
that?
do
you
--
you
consider
that
that
involved

rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
we
have
common
law
jurisdiction
of
that?
chief
justice

under

chief
justice

right.

about
