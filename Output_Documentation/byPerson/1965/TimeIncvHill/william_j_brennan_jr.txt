are
you
suggesting
that
he
called

but
what
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
that
that's
--
now,
that's
what's
not
clear.
you
said
that
you're
not
suggesting
that
he
called
the
press
conference.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
the
--
this
was
news
and
the
press
was
there,
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

did
they
leave
philadelphia
or
was
there
some
evidence
that
they
left
philadelphia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tried
to
escape
the
publicity
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
an
incipient
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incipient
leer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
a
coupled
it
up
with
leer
and
incipient?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
may
i
ask
mr.
medina,
are
these
differences
in
the
appellate
division
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
differences
in
the
interpretation
of
the
new
york
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
gather
of
course
is,
what
the
new
york
courts
construe
their
statute
to
be,
it
should
be
no
concern
to
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we're
--
we
can
be
concerned
only
whether
--
to
the
question
whether
the
statute
as
construed
as
you
suggested
that
once
filed
of
the
first
amendment
and
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
i've
read
this
opinion,
i
don't
see
that
they
turn
on
any
constitutional
differences
among
the
judges,
do
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
i
agree
but
what's
the
--
the
division
among
the
judges
is
over
the
correct
meaning
of
the
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
significance
do
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
significance
of
the
division,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
has
upon
the
constitutional
question
before
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that
wasn't
my
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
my
question
mr.
medina.
i'm
just
trying
to
discover
what
the
significance
is
of
the
division
among
the
judges
in
new
york.
if
that
division
is
only
over
the
meaning,
the
instruction
of
the
statute,
it
has
no
significance
for
our
purposes
here,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
didn't
read
them
though
with
saying
that
they
reached
that
conclusion
based
on
any
constitutional
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
theory.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
new
york
has
told
us
that
under
the
test
of
its
statute,
its
statute
does
fit
these
facts
and
there's
no
point
arguing
about
that
in
this
court,
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
try
to
(inaudible)
but
that's
what
we're
trying
to
get
to.
and
why
argue
with
us
whether
new
york
correctly
constitute
its
statute
as
applied
to
these
facts.
it
seems
to
me
your
only
argument
here
is
that
that
thing
the
construction
of
the
new
york
statute
does
it
offend
--
does
that
construction
defend
the
first
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
don't
we
get
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
tried
going
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
do
not.
not
from
the
point
of
view
of
privacy
your
honor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
sir.
i
don't
believe
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
do
start
with
the
premise
that
there
is
a
--
some
constitutional
protection
for
privacy
though.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
you're
suggesting
that
it
is
also
of
course
that
there
is
a
constitutional
protection
for
free
press.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you're
going
to
try
to
suggest
to
us
a
standard
by
which
those
two
can
be
reconciled,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
therefore
i'm
wishing
you'd
get
to
whether
it
would
stand
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
this
instance,
that
is
the
play.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
here,
newsworthy
because
of
these
exhibits
you've
shown
as
of
what
happened
on
the
case
but
rather
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
do
you
define
relevance,
in
what
sense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
suppose
you
say
false
--
truth
or
falsity
should
--
is
not
to
be
a
consideration.
also,
these
were
knowingly
a
false
--
if
comparison
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
falsity
here,
isn't
it?
in
the
sense
that
the
--
there
is
--
there
are
differences
between
the
actual
incident
and
the
play,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
in
saying
it
were
the
same
thing,
that
would
--
that
was
a
false
statement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
suppose
you
knew
that
they
were
not
the
same
thing
and
yet
made
the
false
statement,
then
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
no
matter
how
knowledgeable
you
maybe
in
the
falsity
of
the
statement
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
they
are
relevant
there's
no
libel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
however,
knowingly
false
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know.
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
want
to
be
sure.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
however,
(inaudible)
knowingly
false
statement,
nevertheless
there
was
no
liability.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
this
instance
mr.
nixon
if
the
reader
gets
the
impression
that
seeing
the
play,
he
is
going
to
see
something
that
happened
to
the
hills
whereas
in
fact
what
he
sees
--
when
the
see
--
when
he
sees
the
play
is
not
what
happened
to
the
hills,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
nixon,
may
i
ask
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
that
the
court
of
appeals
--
i
wouldn't
make
it
difficult
(inaudible)
let's
say
the
practice
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
here
they
affirmed
on
the
opinions
both
of
justice
stevens
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
rabin.
so
i
gather
when
justice
rabin
say
this,
"the
difficulty
with
the
provision
of
the
defendant's
time,
that
if
for
trade,
the
previous
dealing
in
the
high
(inaudible)
manner
have
represented
that
the
play
was
a
true
version
of
that
event.
it
was
not
--
it
was
fictionalized
and
the
jury
so
found
consequently
and
prior
to
section
1
of
the
civil
rights
law
that
in
(inaudible),
you
are
not
--
to
say
that
this
case
comes
us
to
with
a
finding
that
section
51
first
of
all
is
limited
at
least
as
applied
here,
the
liability
because
this
was
fictionalized
and
is
really
so
find
and
as
--
in
a
first
amendment
context
(inaudible)
of
a
determination
based
on
a
--
this
finding
that
this
was
a
fictionalized
version
of
the
hills
incident,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
you're
telling
us
that
the
new
york
cases,
it
needs
to
limit
the
statute
to
the
application
where
those
three
things
appear?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
nixon,
is
there
any
question
here
or
sufficiency
in
the
evidence
if
i
understand
you,
fictionalization,
conscious
fictionalization
i
think
you
were
just
saying
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
an
essential
element
of
liability
under
this
statute
if
it's
(inaudible)
first
amendment
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
now,
what
about
conscious
fictionalization,
is
fictionalization
in
of
itself
import
a
conscious
on
truth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
an
arguable
distinction
that
this
statute
clearly
said
they
may
be
liable
at
least
for
a
fictionalized
version
of
a
news
event.
that
might
satisfy
first
amendment
but
new
york
has
added
an
additional
limitation.
the
limitation
being
that
it
must
be
a
fictionalized
version
for
profit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
involve
a
(inaudible)
aspect
of
fictionalization
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
complete
charge
is
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it
mr.
nixon
that
we
can't
really
know
how
limited
it
is
merely
by
reading
it
based
on
the
statute.
i
understand
from
your
argument
that
case
after
case
had
cut
it
down
in
its
present
size,
do
you
get
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
limiting
construction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
mr.
medina,
i
noticed
the
title
section
50
is
right
of
privacy
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
word
nowhere
appears
in
the
text
of
the
statute
that
cover
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
does
it
get
in
the
title,
it's
the
part
of
the
original
enactment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
--
when
was
that
decided?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
saying,
mr.
medina,
that
fiction
or
fictionalization
is
really
under
new
york
law
only
synonymous
with
falsehood
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
medina,
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
with
this
new
york
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
completely?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
if
we
did,
that
this
case
--
that
this
case,
at
least,
cannot
be
retried.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
we
dealing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
say.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
your
test,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
a
public
fact,
if
it's
been
in
--
in
the
past,
a
newsworthy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it,
newsworthy
item
means
only
that
it
had
gotten
to
the
news.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who's
going
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who's
going
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
you
drew
a
line
though
it's
something
called
the
private
area.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
that
area?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ow
about
mrs.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
how
about
mrs.
blumenthal's
story?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
she
did
it
in
her
store.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
as
--
surely,
your
area
of
private
fact,
there
is
that
distinction
between
public
fact
and
private
is
a
very,
very
narrow
and
limited
one
indeed,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
we're
still
--
we're
in
the
house
or
in
the
bedroom
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
in
agreement
with
mr.
medina
that
constitutionally,
facts
of
life
is
--
has
to
be
limited
to
intentionally
or
recklessly
false
statement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
what
page
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
mr.
nixon,
if
the
new
york
statute
only
reaches
knowing
or
intentional
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
falsity,
now,
what
are
we
to
do
with
this
affirmance
of
--
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
that
concurring
opinion
of
the
appellate
division
and
the
sentence
in
that
concurring
opinion
that
is
quoted
at
--
in
question
2
that
we
asked
to
be
discussed
in
your
argument.
i
think
it's
at
page
5
of
your
brief,
the
bottom
of
that
page.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
i
may
suggest
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he
--
accepting
that
is
so
that
there's
never
been
a
case
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
where
within
the
terms
of
that
sentence,
liability
has
been
visited
on
a
defendant.
nevertheless,
what
are
we
to
do
here
with
the
affirmance
of
an
opinion
which
includes
that
sentence,
an
affirmance
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
ordinarily,
we,
of
course,
let
me
take,
were
bound
by
it,
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
the
highest
court
of
the
state
pronounced
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering,
mr.
nixon,
it
may
very
well
be
a
dictum.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
indeed,
if
this
were
an
opinion
of
one
of
my
brother,
and
i
--
i
say
it
was.
[laughter]
but
i
wonder
if
we're
in
that
position
in
regard
to
a
state
court's
interpretation
of
a
state
statute.
i
wonder
if
we
--
you
--
if
--
if
we
are
free
to
just
discard
it
--
disregarded
it
as
merely
dictum.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
notwithstanding
dombrowski
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
in
that
line
of
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
think
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
go
--
no,
go
ahead.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
indeed,
if
that
were
the
law,
would
you
think
of
--
could
it
withstand
the
first
amendment
if
it
were?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
really,
i
wish
i
could
be
sure
of
that
mr.
nixon
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that's
my
difficulties.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
suggest,
mr.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
nixon.
my
difficulty
is
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
it's
the
responsibility
of
this
court.
indeed,
i
have
some
serious
question
on
whether
--
i
don't
think
they
have
the
power
to
resolve
conflicts
among
the
new
york
cases
where
i've
had
an
independent
conclusion
of
what
the
new
york
law
is.
now,
whatever
may
be
so
of
blumenthal
or
humiston,
we
do
have
the
adoption.
as
i
read
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case
of
a
sentence
that
in
the
circumstances
even
of
a
newsworthy
item,
the
privilege
to
use
ones
name
should
not
be
granted
even
though
a
true
account
of
the
events
is
given,
let
alone
when
the
account
is
senseless,
sensationalized
and
fictionalized.
now,
if
that's
the
law
of
new
york,
if
that's
the
interpretation
of
the
new
york
statute,
which
we
have
to
take
in
deciding
this
case,
number
one,
i
have
serious
difficulty
whether
that
interpretation
can
stand
in
the
face
of
the
first
amendment.
and
secondly,
if
it
can't,
whether
under
dombrowski
and
button
and
that
line
of
cases,
even
though
this
is
an
intentionally
false
statement,
as
you
have
argued,
time
doesn't
have
standing
but
as
it
does,
to
strike
down
the
statute
under
the
first
amendment,
and
that's
my
difficulty.
and
whether
that's
to
be
resolved
by
either
circuit
or
whether
we
ought
to
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
and
ask
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
whether
actually,
they
meant
this
to
be
the
interpretation
of
the
statute,
it's
the
kind
of
thing
that
i'm
trying
to
worry
through.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
say
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
don't
think
that's
quite
it.
my
question
goes
to
whether
when
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“the
judgment
is
affirmed
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
majority
and
concurring
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals
whenever
it
may
have
been
the
law
laid
down
in
prior
cases,
has
now
adopted
this
law
of
new
york
that
recovery
can
be
had
in
the
circumstances
of
the
report
of
a
newsworthy
account
if
its
purpose
is
not
to
report
news
but
merely
to
increase
circulation.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry
too,
mr.
nixon,
that
--
as
you
can
see,
this
point
bothers
me
more
than
anything
else
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
this
case
than
it
has
in
the
beginning.
when
the
virginia
court
of
appeals
in
butts
stated
without
qualification
an
interpretation
of
the
statute,
they're
involved,
which
we
said
defendant
of
the
first
amendment.
we
there
held
that
even
though
a
correct
interpretation,
a
limiting
interpretation
of
the
statutes
on
the
facts
of
that
case
might
have
justified
sustaining
the
--
i
think
it
was
the
conviction
in
the
butts
case
or
whatever
that
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
could
not
be
so
since
we
knew
that
the
interpretation
given
the
statute,
it
is
in
the
first
amendment
and
similarly,
in
dombrowski.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
here
my
problem
is,
we've
had
other
instances
where
we've
been
unsure
of
what
the
interpretation
of
the
state
statute
was
as
expressed
in
an
opinion
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
minnesota
(inaudible)
a
whole
after
cases,
everyone
in
doubt.
and
in
some
of
them,
what
we
have
done
is
to
send
it
back
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
highest
state
court
and
clear
it
up
for
us.
we
did
on
the
--
in
your
case
of
your
own
state
a
couple
of
years
ago.
i
forgot
the
name
of
that
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
state
of
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
california.
[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
did
at
that
time.
we
sent
--
sent
it
back
and
asked
the
california
supreme
court
to
tell
us
what
they
meant.
we
did
it
with
the
state
of
washington
only
a
few
years
ago.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
don't
understand
why
this
situation
doesn't
call
for
the
same.
if
this
is
mere
dictum,
then
let
the
court
of
appeals
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
yes,
please.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
medina,
i'll
have
to
put
the
same
question
i
put
mr.
nixon.
do
you
--
why
should
we
try
to
resolve
what
the
new
york
statute
means?
in
face
of
this
affirmance,
why
don't
we
sent
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
you
put
--
if
you're
saying
to
us
what
we
ought
to
do
with
the
side
that
wasn't
taken.
and
mr.
nixon
says,
“you
ought
to
decide
that
it
was
dictum
and
i
still
suggest
that
between
the
two
of
you,
why
don't
we
ask
the
court
of
appeals
to
tell
us
whether
it
was
dictum
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
just
--
that's
--
you
reiterated
now
a
couple
of
times,
that's
your
principal
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
whatever
may
--
constitutionally,
you
agree
that
liability
could
be
visited
for
intentional
knowing
falsity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
say
the
case
was
not
submitted
to
the
jury
under
instructions
which
would
have
limited
liability
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
the
intention
--
intentionally
knowing
false.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
he
called
the
press
conference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
that's
--
now,
that's
what's
not
clear.
you
said
that
you're
not
suggesting
that
he
called
the
press
conference.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
the
--
this
was
news
and
the
press
was
there,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
they
leave
philadelphia
or
was
there
some
evidence
that
they
left
philadelphia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tried
to
escape
the
publicity
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
an
incipient
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incipient
leer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
a
coupled
it
up
with
leer
and
incipient?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
may
i
ask
mr.
medina,
are
these
differences
in
the
appellate
division
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
differences
in
the
interpretation
of
the
new
york
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
gather
of
course
is,
what
the
new
york
courts
construe
their
statute
to
be,
it
should
be
no
concern
to
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we're
--
we
can
be
concerned
only
whether
--
to
the
question
whether
the
statute
as
construed
as
you
suggested
that
once
filed
of
the
first
amendment
and
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
i've
read
this
opinion,
i
don't
see
that
they
turn
on
any
constitutional
differences
among
the
judges,
do
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
i
agree
but
what's
the
--
the
division
among
the
judges
is
over
the
correct
meaning
of
the
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
significance
do
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
significance
of
the
division,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
has
upon
the
constitutional
question
before
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that
wasn't
my
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
my
question
mr.
medina.
i'm
just
trying
to
discover
what
the
significance
is
of
the
division
among
the
judges
in
new
york.
if
that
division
is
only
over
the
meaning,
the
instruction
of
the
statute,
it
has
no
significance
for
our
purposes
here,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
didn't
read
them
though
with
saying
that
they
reached
that
conclusion
based
on
any
constitutional
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
theory.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
new
york
has
told
us
that
under
the
test
of
its
statute,
its
statute
does
fit
these
facts
and
there's
no
point
arguing
about
that
in
this
court,
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
try
to
(inaudible)
but
that's
what
we're
trying
to
get
to.
and
why
argue
with
us
whether
new
york
correctly
constitute
its
statute
as
applied
to
these
facts.
it
seems
to
me
your
only
argument
here
is
that
that
thing
the
construction
of
the
new
york
statute
does
it
offend
--
does
that
construction
defend
the
first
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
don't
we
get
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
tried
going
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
do
not.
not
from
the
point
of
view
of
privacy
your
honor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
sir.
i
don't
believe
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
do
start
with
the
premise
that
there
is
a
--
some
constitutional
protection
for
privacy
though.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
you're
suggesting
that
it
is
also
of
course
that
there
is
a
constitutional
protection
for
free
press.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you're
going
to
try
to
suggest
to
us
a
standard
by
which
those
two
can
be
reconciled,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
therefore
i'm
wishing
you'd
get
to
whether
it
would
stand
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
this
instance,
that
is
the
play.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
here,
newsworthy
because
of
these
exhibits
you've
shown
as
of
what
happened
on
the
case
but
rather
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
do
you
define
relevance,
in
what
sense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
suppose
you
say
false
--
truth
or
falsity
should
--
is
not
to
be
a
consideration.
also,
these
were
knowingly
a
false
--
if
comparison
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
falsity
here,
isn't
it?
in
the
sense
that
the
--
there
is
--
there
are
differences
between
the
actual
incident
and
the
play,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
in
saying
it
were
the
same
thing,
that
would
--
that
was
a
false
statement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
suppose
you
knew
that
they
were
not
the
same
thing
and
yet
made
the
false
statement,
then
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
no
matter
how
knowledgeable
you
maybe
in
the
falsity
of
the
statement
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
they
are
relevant
there's
no
libel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
however,
knowingly
false
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know.
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
want
to
be
sure.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
however,
(inaudible)
knowingly
false
statement,
nevertheless
there
was
no
liability.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
this
instance
mr.
nixon
if
the
reader
gets
the
impression
that
seeing
the
play,
he
is
going
to
see
something
that
happened
to
the
hills
whereas
in
fact
what
he
sees
--
when
the
see
--
when
he
sees
the
play
is
not
what
happened
to
the
hills,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
nixon,
may
i
ask
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
that
the
court
of
appeals
--
i
wouldn't
make
it
difficult
(inaudible)
let's
say
the
practice
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
here
they
affirmed
on
the
opinions
both
of
justice
stevens
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
rabin.
so
i
gather
when
justice
rabin
say
this,
"the
difficulty
with
the
provision
of
the
defendant's
time,
that
if
for
trade,
the
previous
dealing
in
the
high
(inaudible)
manner
have
represented
that
the
play
was
a
true
version
of
that
event.
it
was
not
--
it
was
fictionalized
and
the
jury
so
found
consequently
and
prior
to
section
1
of
the
civil
rights
law
that
in
(inaudible),
you
are
not
--
to
say
that
this
case
comes
us
to
with
a
finding
that
section
51
first
of
all
is
limited
at
least
as
applied
here,
the
liability
because
this
was
fictionalized
and
is
really
so
find
and
as
--
in
a
first
amendment
context
(inaudible)
of
a
determination
based
on
a
--
this
finding
that
this
was
a
fictionalized
version
of
the
hills
incident,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
you're
telling
us
that
the
new
york
cases,
it
needs
to
limit
the
statute
to
the
application
where
those
three
things
appear?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
nixon,
is
there
any
question
here
or
sufficiency
in
the
evidence
if
i
understand
you,
fictionalization,
conscious
fictionalization
i
think
you
were
just
saying
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
an
essential
element
of
liability
under
this
statute
if
it's
(inaudible)
first
amendment
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
now,
what
about
conscious
fictionalization,
is
fictionalization
in
of
itself
import
a
conscious
on
truth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
an
arguable
distinction
that
this
statute
clearly
said
they
may
be
liable
at
least
for
a
fictionalized
version
of
a
news
event.
that
might
satisfy
first
amendment
but
new
york
has
added
an
additional
limitation.
the
limitation
being
that
it
must
be
a
fictionalized
version
for
profit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
involve
a
(inaudible)
aspect
of
fictionalization
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
complete
charge
is
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it
mr.
nixon
that
we
can't
really
know
how
limited
it
is
merely
by
reading
it
based
on
the
statute.
i
understand
from
your
argument
that
case
after
case
had
cut
it
down
in
its
present
size,
do
you
get
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
limiting
construction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
mr.
medina,
i
noticed
the
title
section
50
is
right
of
privacy
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
word
nowhere
appears
in
the
text
of
the
statute
that
cover
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
does
it
get
in
the
title,
it's
the
part
of
the
original
enactment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
--
when
was
that
decided?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
saying,
mr.
medina,
that
fiction
or
fictionalization
is
really
under
new
york
law
only
synonymous
with
falsehood
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
medina,
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
with
this
new
york
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
completely?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
if
we
did,
that
this
case
--
that
this
case,
at
least,
cannot
be
retried.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
we
dealing
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
say.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
your
test,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
a
public
fact,
if
it's
been
in
--
in
the
past,
a
newsworthy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it,
newsworthy
item
means
only
that
it
had
gotten
to
the
news.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who's
going
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who's
going
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
you
drew
a
line
though
it's
something
called
the
private
area.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
that
area?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ow
about
mrs.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
how
about
mrs.
blumenthal's
story?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
she
did
it
in
her
store.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
as
--
surely,
your
area
of
private
fact,
there
is
that
distinction
between
public
fact
and
private
is
a
very,
very
narrow
and
limited
one
indeed,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
we're
still
--
we're
in
the
house
or
in
the
bedroom
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
in
agreement
with
mr.
medina
that
constitutionally,
facts
of
life
is
--
has
to
be
limited
to
intentionally
or
recklessly
false
statement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
what
page
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
mr.
nixon,
if
the
new
york
statute
only
reaches
knowing
or
intentional
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
falsity,
now,
what
are
we
to
do
with
this
affirmance
of
--
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
that
concurring
opinion
of
the
appellate
division
and
the
sentence
in
that
concurring
opinion
that
is
quoted
at
--
in
question
2
that
we
asked
to
be
discussed
in
your
argument.
i
think
it's
at
page
5
of
your
brief,
the
bottom
of
that
page.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
i
may
suggest
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he
--
accepting
that
is
so
that
there's
never
been
a
case
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
where
within
the
terms
of
that
sentence,
liability
has
been
visited
on
a
defendant.
nevertheless,
what
are
we
to
do
here
with
the
affirmance
of
an
opinion
which
includes
that
sentence,
an
affirmance
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
ordinarily,
we,
of
course,
let
me
take,
were
bound
by
it,
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
the
highest
court
of
the
state
pronounced
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering,
mr.
nixon,
it
may
very
well
be
a
dictum.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
indeed,
if
this
were
an
opinion
of
one
of
my
brother,
and
i
--
i
say
it
was.
[laughter]
but
i
wonder
if
we're
in
that
position
in
regard
to
a
state
court's
interpretation
of
a
state
statute.
i
wonder
if
we
--
you
--
if
--
if
we
are
free
to
just
discard
it
--
disregarded
it
as
merely
dictum.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
notwithstanding
dombrowski
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
in
that
line
of
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
think
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
go
--
no,
go
ahead.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
indeed,
if
that
were
the
law,
would
you
think
of
--
could
it
withstand
the
first
amendment
if
it
were?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
really,
i
wish
i
could
be
sure
of
that
mr.
nixon
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that's
my
difficulties.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
suggest,
mr.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
nixon.
my
difficulty
is
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
do
not
think
that
it's
the
responsibility
of
this
court.
indeed,
i
have
some
serious
question
on
whether
--
i
don't
think
they
have
the
power
to
resolve
conflicts
among
the
new
york
cases
where
i've
had
an
independent
conclusion
of
what
the
new
york
law
is.
now,
whatever
may
be
so
of
blumenthal
or
humiston,
we
do
have
the
adoption.
as
i
read
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case
of
a
sentence
that
in
the
circumstances
even
of
a
newsworthy
item,
the
privilege
to
use
ones
name
should
not
be
granted
even
though
a
true
account
of
the
events
is
given,
let
alone
when
the
account
is
senseless,
sensationalized
and
fictionalized.
now,
if
that's
the
law
of
new
york,
if
that's
the
interpretation
of
the
new
york
statute,
which
we
have
to
take
in
deciding
this
case,
number
one,
i
have
serious
difficulty
whether
that
interpretation
can
stand
in
the
face
of
the
first
amendment.
and
secondly,
if
it
can't,
whether
under
dombrowski
and
button
and
that
line
of
cases,
even
though
this
is
an
intentionally
false
statement,
as
you
have
argued,
time
doesn't
have
standing
but
as
it
does,
to
strike
down
the
statute
under
the
first
amendment,
and
that's
my
difficulty.
and
whether
that's
to
be
resolved
by
either
circuit
or
whether
we
ought
to
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
and
ask
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
whether
actually,
they
meant
this
to
be
the
interpretation
of
the
statute,
it's
the
kind
of
thing
that
i'm
trying
to
worry
through.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
say
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
don't
think
that's
quite
it.
my
question
goes
to
whether
when
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“the
judgment
is
affirmed
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
majority
and
concurring
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals
whenever
it
may
have
been
the
law
laid
down
in
prior
cases,
has
now
adopted
this
law
of
new
york
that
recovery
can
be
had
in
the
circumstances
of
the
report
of
a
newsworthy
account
if
its
purpose
is
not
to
report
news
but
merely
to
increase
circulation.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry
too,
mr.
nixon,
that
--
as
you
can
see,
this
point
bothers
me
more
than
anything
else
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
this
case
than
it
has
in
the
beginning.
when
the
virginia
court
of
appeals
in
butts
stated
without
qualification
an
interpretation
of
the
statute,
they're
involved,
which
we
said
defendant
of
the
first
amendment.
we
there
held
that
even
though
a
correct
interpretation,
a
limiting
interpretation
of
the
statutes
on
the
facts
of
that
case
might
have
justified
sustaining
the
--
i
think
it
was
the
conviction
in
the
butts
case
or
whatever
that
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
could
not
be
so
since
we
knew
that
the
interpretation
given
the
statute,
it
is
in
the
first
amendment
and
similarly,
in
dombrowski.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
here
my
problem
is,
we've
had
other
instances
where
we've
been
unsure
of
what
the
interpretation
of
the
state
statute
was
as
expressed
in
an
opinion
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
minnesota
(inaudible)
a
whole
after
cases,
everyone
in
doubt.
and
in
some
of
them,
what
we
have
done
is
to
send
it
back
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
highest
state
court
and
clear
it
up
for
us.
we
did
on
the
--
in
your
case
of
your
own
state
a
couple
of
years
ago.
i
forgot
the
name
of
that
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
state
of
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
california.
[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
did
at
that
time.
we
sent
--
sent
it
back
and
asked
the
california
supreme
court
to
tell
us
what
they
meant.
we
did
it
with
the
state
of
washington
only
a
few
years
ago.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
don't
understand
why
this
situation
doesn't
call
for
the
same.
if
this
is
mere
dictum,
then
let
the
court
of
appeals
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
yes,
please.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
medina,
i'll
have
to
put
the
same
question
i
put
mr.
nixon.
do
you
--
why
should
we
try
to
resolve
what
the
new
york
statute
means?
in
face
of
this
affirmance,
why
don't
we
sent
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
you
put
--
if
you're
saying
to
us
what
we
ought
to
do
with
the
side
that
wasn't
taken.
and
mr.
nixon
says,
“you
ought
to
decide
that
it
was
dictum
and
i
still
suggest
that
between
the
two
of
you,
why
don't
we
ask
the
court
of
appeals
to
tell
us
whether
it
was
dictum
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
just
--
that's
--
you
reiterated
now
a
couple
of
times,
that's
your
principal
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
whatever
may
--
constitutionally,
you
agree
that
liability
could
be
visited
for
intentional
knowing
falsity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
say
the
case
was
not
submitted
to
the
jury
under
instructions
which
would
have
limited
liability
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
the
intention
--
intentionally
knowing
false.
