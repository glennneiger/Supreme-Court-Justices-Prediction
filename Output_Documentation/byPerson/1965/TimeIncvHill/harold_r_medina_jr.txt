mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
state
of
new
york.
it
involves
a
first
amendment
problem
and
involves
the
privacy
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york.
on
file
originally,
there
was
a
jury
verdict
of
$175,000.
reversed
on
appeal,
was
being
grossly
excessive
and
for
prejudicial
error.
upheld
however,
on
liability
with
the
presiding
justice
botein
dissenting
in
a
--
on
a
written
opinion.
retrial
without
a
jury,
a
$30,000
award
that
went
up
to
--
direct
to
the
court
of
appeals,
affirmed
with
--
dissenting,
they
affirmed
on
the
opinions
of
the
appellate
division
with
dissenting
opinion
by
mr.
--
by
judge
fuld
and
judge
bergan
along
the
same
lines
as
presiding
justice
botein.
there
are
three
factual
elements
that
go
into
this
case.
first,
a
1952
incident
in
which
mr.
hill,
the
appellee
and
his
family
were
held
prisoner
by
three
escaped
convicts.
secondly,
a
book
written
in
1953
by
one
joseph
hayes,
later
converted
by
him
into
a
play
in
a
motion
picture
called
“the
desperate
hours”
which
involved
a
family
held
prisoner
by
three
convicts.
and
lastly,
a
reporting
by
life
magazine
in
february
of
1955
when
the
play
appeared
on
broadway
which
involved
a
prominent
mention
of
the
hill
family
in
connection
with
the
recording
on
that
play.
i
think
i
have
two
main
functions
today.
first,
to
tell
you
about
the
facts
and
probably
more
detailed
than
is
normal
because
the
facts
are
somewhat
complex
but
i
think
once
they'll
understood,
the
conclusion
flows
in
actual
belief
from
those
facts.
and
secondly
to
suggest
one
or
two
propositions
that
may
lead
to
what
i
think
is
a
rather
simple
solution
to
this
case
which
has
been
over
--
overly
complicated.
and
i
start
with
mr.
hill
and
his
family
back
in
september
1952
and
he
and
his
wife
in
their
early
40s,
they
were
an
attractive
couple
and
they
had
two
teenage
daughters,
a
young
son
aged
11
and
a
pair
of
four-year-old
twins.
they
lived
in
the
suburbs
of
philadelphia
and
they
got
up
on
september
19
of
1952
and
they
had
breakfast
and
after
breakfast,
mr.
hill
and
their
daughters
went
off,
they
went
to
school
and
he
to
work
and
mrs.
hill
turned
on
the
radio
and
heard
a
report
that
there
had
been
three
escaped
convicts.
shortly
thereafter
and
precisely
at
8:30
o'clock
in
the
morning,
there
was
a
knock
in
the
door
and
there
was
the
three
escaped
convicts.
two
of
them
was
--
were
brothers,
the
older
one
was
the
spokesman
for
the
three
and
they
entered
the
house.
they
held
the
family
captive.
they
captured
mr.
hill
and
their
daughters
when
they
returned
later
on
the
day.
they
stayed
until
3:30
the
following
morning
when
they
left
in
the
family
car.
the
family
was
unharmed.
those
are
the
essential
elements
of
that
incident.
the
next
afternoon
after
mr.
hill
had
reported
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
not
in
that
moment.
there
was
some
clothing
and
some
caviar
--
cash
your
honor.
i'm
trying
to
stress
the
elements
that
--
that'll
come
into
place
later
when
i
get
to
the
desperate
hours.
the
following
afternoon,
mr.
hill
came
out
in
his
floor
--
front
porch
and
with
a
microphone
held
a
press
conference.
a
picture
of
him
with
that
press
conference
is
exhibit
a
at
page
379
of
the
record.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no
sir.
the
press
was
there
and
he
determined
that
he
would
have
to
say
something
to
them
and
he
did.i
do
think
privacy
wise
it
may
be
of
importance
in
our
case.
at
any
event
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
he
gave
publicly
his
story
to
the
press
on
a
microphone.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
privacy
wise,
the
fact
that
this
is
a
public
fact
maybe
of
some
importance
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
not
a
private
fact.
it
would
be
one
thing
if
mr.
hill
had
said
nothing
perhaps
not
going
to
com
--
to
the
police.
and
then
he
had
published
something
about
the
incident.
but
certainly,
this
fact
was
made
public
first
by
mr.
hills'
own
act
and
he
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
the
press
was
there
and
he
was
there
and
he
went
with
a
microphone
and
gave
a
statement
to
them.
now,
whether
you
call
that
calling
a
press
conference
or
not,
i
don't
know
but
that
was
what
happened.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
the
following
morning,
the
new
york
times
had
a
front
page
story
on
it
and
that's
exhibit
b
and
that's
pages
380
and
381
of
the
record
and
it
runs
over
to
the
second
page.
and
mr.
hill
agreed
that
it
was
substantially
what
he
gave
in
his
press
conference.
now,
that
happens
to
be
of
importance
because
later
on
both
the
author
and
the
life
people
have
this
new
york
time
story
before
them.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i've
(inaudible)
what
is
about
that?
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
he
merely
made
a
statement
to
the
press,
i
think
is
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
all
i
was
suggesting
was
that
that
was
precisely
what
happened.
he
was
urged
by
the
police
officers
there
to
say
something
to
the
press
and
he
testified
that
he
himself
wanted
to
say
something
because
he
wanted
to
make
sure
that
they
all
knew
as
precisely
what
happened
on
there.
that's
the
fact
of
the
matter.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
now,
thereafter,
after
that
incident,
the
hill
family
moved
from
philadelphia
and
went
about
their
ways
and
tried
to
forget
about
them.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes
sir,
they
did.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
in
part
of
it,
they
had
planned
to
leave
before
that
but
they
accelerated
to
move
was
the
testimony
your
honor.
and
move
to
greenwich,
connecticut
that
fall.
now,
the
next
actor
that
comes
in
is
mr.
joseph
hayes.
he
in
april
and
may
of
1953
wrote
"the
desperate
hours."
he
had
the
new
york
times
clipping
before
him.
later
on,
that
novel
which
became
a
bestseller
and
which
was
serialized
in
couriers
which
came
out
with
the
literary
guild
which
would
--
came
out
as
a
paperback
with
the
pocketbooks
and
a
con
--
in
condensed
form
with
reader's
digest
was
turned
into
a
play.
and
the
play
which
is
what
we're
reporting
on
was
identical
with
the
story
which
i
have
just
given
you.
there
was
a
middle
40s,
attractive
couple
living
in
the
suburbs
with
a
teenage
daughter
and
a
10-year-old
son.
and
they
got
up
in
the
morning
and
had
breakfast
and
mr.
hillard
was
the
name
of
the
man
in
the
play
and
the
novel.
mr.
hillard
left
with
his
teenage
daughter
and
mrs.
hillard
turned
on
the
radio
and
heard
a
story
about
three
escaped
convicts.
and
promptly,
at
8:30
in
the
morning,
the
same
as
--
actually
happened
the
same
as
in
the
new
york
times,
three
convicts,
escaped
convicts
arrived,
two
of
them
were
brothers,
the
older
one
acted
as
the
spokesman
for
the
three
of
them.
and
they
entered
the
house
and
thereafter
they
captured
mr.
hillard
and
the
daughter
when
they
returned
and
they
left
thereafter
and
the
family
were
unharmed.
now,
that
was
--
that
is
the
essence
of
the
desperate
hours
leaving
out
the
incidents
which
occurred
in
the
house
when
the
convicts
were
there.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
one
of
--
there
was
--
one
of
the
significant
things
your
honor
is
no
protest
was
made
to
anyone
by
mr.
hill
until
october
1955
with
the
institution
of
this
suit.
there
was
a
lawsuit
commenced
in
october
of
1935
by
mr.
hill
was
joined
as
defendants
(inaudible)
colliers,
for
the
serialization
in
colliers.
the
literary
guild
and
random
house
for
the
book,
the
reader's
digest
for
the
condensation,
pocketbooks
for
the
paperback,
the
desperate
hours
for
the
play
and
paramount
pictures
so
they
all
came
in
eventually.
but
after
the
novel
came
out
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no
sir,
there
was
nothing
whatsoever.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
i'm
about
to
come
up
to
that
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
because
as
soon
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
as
the
book
appeared
and
incidentally
when
the
book
appeared
the
philadelphia
inquirer
reviewed
it
and
said
philadelphia
readers
will
immediately
recognize,
they
sliced
out
of
real
life
of
the
recent
past.
and
incidentally
when
the
play
first
came
out
and
long
before
life
reviewed
it,
the
philadelphia
inquirer
said,
this
is
based
on
a
real
life
incident.
suffice
it
to
say
that
as
soon
as
the
novel
came
out
and
thereafter
with
these
other
publications,
all
of
the
hill's
friends
and
their
--
his
business
acquaintances
came
up
and
say,
“your
story
has
been
written
up
in
a
book.
haven't
you
read
it?”
so,
that
there
was
immediate
identification
by
their
friends
and
acquaintances
and
that's
--
you
would
expect
not
very
bad.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i'm
not
going
to
try
that
in
detail
your
honor
or
(inaudible)
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
it
will
take
too
long,
that
a
period
of
time.
its
covered
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
completely
in
our
briefs.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
but
what
on
the
incidents
in
the
house.
the
same
incidents
did
not
take
place
in
the
novel
as
took
–
its
place
in
the
incident.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no
sir,
i
do
not.
i
think
that's
an
incorrect
characterization.
i
think
a
reading
of
the
play
and
that's
why
it's
difficult
to
put
this
in
an
argument
rather
than
put
in
a
brief
or
read
the
play.
well,
we'll
convince
you
that
there
were
only
four
incidents
which
could
be
called
violence
in
the
play.
mr.
hill
was
struck
twice
but
not
severely
injured.
mr.
hillard
was
struck
twice
but
not
severely
injured.
the
boy
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
he
was
not
struck
at
all.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
but
the
degree
of
violence,
if
--
really
where
it
comes
down
to
is
a
degree
of
terror
because
on
the
terror
end
of
it,
there's
no
doubt
for
what
the
original
incident
was
the
most
terrifying
one
and
was
so
testified
to
by
mrs.
hill.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no
sir.
they
--
their
brief
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
specifically
says
that
the
daughter
was
hurt.
it
was
not
in
the
play
or
the
book.
it's
a
plain
erroneous
statement
of
fact.
there
were
two
incidents
when
one
of
the
convicts
had
in
--
sort
of
incipient
leer
at
the
daughter
and
in
each
instance
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
the
younger
brother
of
the
convicts
politely
cut
him
off
and
he
throughout
addressed
the
daughter
as
miss.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
leer.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
he
started
to
think
according
--
if
you
read
the
part
in
the
play.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
i
think
what
i
coming
down
to
and
what
i'm
trying
to
show
because
the
main
point
i'm
going
to
end
up
with
is
the
substantial
relationship
between
the
two
even
though
you
can't
take
every
incident
on
the
thing.
now
after
these
things
have
happened,
we
entered
the
scene
and
our
editor-in-charge
of
the
entertainment
world,
tom
prideaux.
the
first
he
heard
of
it
is
in
a
chance
conversation
with
robert
montgomery,
the
director
of
the
play.
and
robert
montgomery
told
him
that
it
was
based
upon
an
incident.
shortly
thereafter,
he
saw
a
man
named
bradley
smith,
a
freelance
photographer
and
a
friend
of
joseph
hayes
the
author
and
bradley
smith
said,
there
is
a
substantial
connection
between
the
play
and
a
real
life
incident
in
philadelphia.
later,
he
noticed
that
the
play
was
opening
in
philadelphia.
he
called
hayes,
the
author
in
philadelphia
and
said,
“was
there
an
incident?”
and
hayes
said,
“yes”.
and
there
after
at
prideaux's
request,
hayes
made
arrangements
to
go
out
to
the
house
which
the
hill's
formerly
had
occupied
but
then
they'd
left
so
that
pictures
could
be
taken
in
the
house.
now
based
on
all
of
that,
and
the
fact
that
mr.
prideaux
had
read
the
time's
article,
he
saw
the
play
twice
and
he
said,
“i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
play
was
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
family's
incident.
and
based
on
that,
i
thought
that
what
we
finally
wrote
in
the
article
was
completely
truthful
and
true
and
honest.
i
may
say
also
that
is
as
the
case
in
any
life
with
time
article,
there
is
a
specific
researcher
assigned
to
check
the
matter
and
her
job
is
to
check
the
facts
and
put
a
checkmark
over
every
word
to
show
that
she's
going
back
to
make
sure
of
his
accuracy.”
and
she
was
the
young
lady
named
laura
ecker
at
the
time
of
the
trial
she'd
left
us
and
was
married
named
laura
ludwig.
and
she
testified,
“yes,
i
checked
this
article
and
the
checkmarks
appeared
and
i
was
satisfied
that
it
was
true
and
correct
and
honest.”
now
the
article
itself
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no
sir,
she
did
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact
mr.
prideaux
said,
“the
matter
of
privacy
never
entered
my
mind
because
it
was
a
matter
of
public
record.
it
had
been
in
streaming
headlines.”
and
i
think
this
matter
of
public
record
i'll
be
reverting
to
your
honor
and
it
comes
down
to
this
public
fact
business.
the
article
itself
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
she
read
the
time's
article,
she
saw
the
play.
she
talked
with
prideaux
and
got
prideaux's
version
of
having
talked
with
montgomery,
with
bradley
smith,
and
then
with
the
author.
and
the
fact
that
the
author
had
made
all
the
preparations
for
use
of
this
very
house
which
was
obviously
envisaging
a
connection
between
the
incident
and
the
house
and
said
nothing
more.
prideaux
said,
“i
assumed
after
all
that
that
there
was
a
connection.”
the
article
itself
at
pages
15
and
following
in
the
record
is
headed,
"true
crime
inspires
tense
play,"
and
it
shows
the
hill
house
and
then
goes
on
and
says,
the
ordeal
of
a
family
trapped
by
convicts
gives
broadway
a
new
thriller,
the
desperate
hours.
then
it
goes
to
say
“three
years
ago,
americans
all
over
the
country
read
about
the
desperate
ordeal
of
a
james
hill
family
who
were
held
prisoners
in
their
home
outside
philadelphia
by
three
escaped
convicts.”
later,
they
read
about
it
in
joseph
hayes'
novel,
the
desperate
hours,
inspired
by
that
family's
experience.
now
they
can
see
the
story
reenacted
in
hayes'
broadway
play
based
on
the
book.
the
next
year,
they
were
seen
in
this
movie
which
had
been
filmed
and
which
is
being
held
up.
the
play
directed
by
robert
montgomery
and
expertly
acted
is
a
heart
stopping
account
of
how
a
family
rose
to
heroism
in
a
crisis
then
it
goes
on.
now
that's
the
gist
of
the
article.
after
the
summons
and
complaint
served
in
this
action
originally
named
all
of
these
other
defendants
which
i
have
pointed
out
to
your
honor
and
also
through
three
verified
complaints
said
that
the
play
with
some
fictionalization
was
based
on
the
hill's
story
and
that
the
play
constituted
a
portrayal
of
the
hill
story.
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
author
of
the
play
joseph
hayes
was
examined
before
trial
and
obviously
being
anxious
to
avoid
the
effect
of
those
three
amended
complaints
he
backpedaled
as
far
as
he
could
on
any
connection
between
the
incident
and
the
play
although
he
did
affirm
that
the
title
"true
crime
inspires
tense
play"
was
a
correct
and
true
title.
and
did
state
that
later,
they
read
about
it
in
joseph
hayes
novel,
“the
desperate
hours”
inspired
by
the
family's
experience
was
true
and
correct.
thereafter,
the
present
complaint
was
served
nameling
--
naming
time,
inc.
and
hayes
and
the
desperate
hours
company
as
the
only
remaining
defendants.
but
this
complaint
says,
it
wasn't
a
portrayal
at
all
and
it
wasn't
based
on
an
incident
at
all
and
to
have
said
that
was
at
--
was
completely
false.
we
move
for
summary
judgment
that
was
denied
and
was
affirmed
on
appeal.
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
being
based
on
precisely
the
same
grounds.
i'm
now
putting
forward
--
or
will
be
putting
forward
your
honors.
at
the
trial,
mr.
hill
was
merely
the
sole
witness
for
himself
on
saying
that
he
had
been
distressed
by
this
and
people
would
think
that
he'd
lied
when
he
described
what
had
actually
happened.
hayes
was
cross-examined
a
--
cross-examined
and
he
finally
admitted
on
cross-examination
that
the
matter
had
been
triggered
in
a
very
direct
way.
it
was
brought
out
on
cross-examination
that
in
1954
when
the
novel
came
out,
he
had
written
a
little
advertising
splurge
that
came
out
in
wings,
the
reader's
digest
magazine,
stating
that
the
story
was
based
on
two
incidents,
one,
the
snyder
case
in
new
york
and
the
hill
case.
the
snyder
case
in
new
york
had
no
resemblance.
it
was
merely
one
convict
pulling
a
woman
and
her
young
daughter,
a
prisoner
and
killing
the
daughter
as
the
police
closed
in.
later,
it
was
brought
out
that
in
january
1955
and
this
is
prior
to
the
life
article,
he
had
written
an
article
for
the
new
york
times
entitled,
“fact
out
of
fiction”
and
he
said
it
was
based
then
on
four
incidents.
the
snyder
case,
the
hill
case
and
two
others,
one
in
detroit
that
turned
out
to
be
just
a
man
driving
the
girl
out
on
a
car
and
another
one,
a
california
episode
where
some
convicts
captured
a
car
in
a
dessert,
drove
back
to
a
family's
home
and
then
were
captured
as
they
drove
back
to
town.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
in
this
court,
it
makes
absolutely
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
in
this
court,
we
have
to
assume
falsity.
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
i
was
saying
true.
constitutionally,
in
this
court
we
have
to
assume
that
the
inference
we
drew
was
erroneous.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
quite
true
your
honor
except
that
the
sole
test
that
was
utilized
with
the
jury,
it
was
a
dual
test.
one
was
a
remodel,
to
increase
circulation.
it
was
to
my
mind,
it's
just
crazy
(inaudible)
because
any
publisher
has
a
motive
to
increase
circulation
so
any
jury
is
always
going
to
say
“yes”
to
that.
it
might
just
well
say,
“it
is
your
motive
sitting
on
the
bench
to
earn
money,
you're
obviously
being
paid
for
it
but
your
motive
is
to
do
a
good
job
as
a
judge.”
so
if
the
motive
to
increase
circulation
proves
nothing,
the
other
thing
was
truth
or
falsity.
and
all
i'm
going
to
be
working
up
to
is
that
you
cannot
constitutionally
use
that
as
a
test
in
a
“right
of
privacy”
action.
but
i'll
come
back
to
your
honor's
question
later
in
that
context
if
you
let
me
go
on
with
a
different
story.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
not
as
yet.
i'm
--
all
i'm
trying
to
do
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
we
certainly
have
said
that
you
cannot
constitutionally
hold
us
for
an
error
in
our
publication.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right,
that's
right.
you
cannot
hold
us
either
on
the
specific
application
or
the
statute
in
general
because
i
think
the
statute
in
general
is
too
broad
which
is
now
the
point.
now,
after
getting
back
to
the
stories
again,
i'd
like
to
get
these
facts
straightened
out
because
i
think
they're
of
importance.
after
mr.
hayes
was
finished,
prideaux
and
laura
ecker-ludwig
took
the
stand
just
along
the
lines
i've
previously
indicated
on
their
belief
in
the
truth
of
the
article.
and
then
we
went
to
the
question
of
what
went
to
the
jury
and
i
think
it's
perfectly
evident
that
all
that
went
to
the
jury
was
the
truth
or
falsity
of
our
article.
and
the
theory
which
was
followed
by
the
plaintiff,
it
was
stated
by
mr.
gorman
(ph),
pages
306
and
307
as
follows.
your
honor
if
they
are
telling
news,
if
they
are
telling
news
purporting
to
tell
news
but
have
as
the
basis
for
the
use
of
the
individual's
name
something
that
is
spurious
or
essentially
false.
that
we
contend
is
to
trade
purposes
so
that
his
test
was
one
of
truth
or
falsity.
and
the
courts
stated
the
same
thing
when
he
denied
my
motion
to
dismiss
because
he
said,
page
292,
“i
think
that
it's
a
question
of
fact
as
to
whether
the
life
article
was
true
or
whether
an
inference
could
be
obtained
from
reading
it
that
it
was
not
true.”
and
then
he
went
on
with
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
novel
you
mean?
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
they're
substantially
the
same,
there's
no
doubt
--
there's
no
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know.
they
strictly
speak
in
relevant
because
all
we
referred
to
was
the
play.
the
author
testified
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
author
testified
however
that
the
play
tracked
the
novel
in
substance
with
appropriate
changes
in
the
conversion
process.
the
court
also
charged
in
addition
to
a
general
charge
if
they
found
falsity
that
was
the
end
of
it.
that
we
could
--
we
--
be
held
if
one
of
our
purposes
was
for
the
purposes
of
making
the
article
more
interesting
to
its
readers.
it
does
went
to
the
jury
purely
on
an
--
question
of
truth
or
falsity.
we
took
an
appeal
and
on
the
first
appeal,
there
were
three
opinions,
one
by
mr.
justice
stevens
were
said
in
effect,
this
must
be
for
advertising
purposes
and
to
increase
the
circulation.
in
any
way,
you
should
have
asked
some
more
questions
of
hayes.
that's
a
negligence
theory
on
that.
a
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
rabin,
he
said
it
obviously
was
to
increase
your
circulation
and
that
should
be
the
test.
and
then
a
dissenting
opinion
by
presiding
justice
botein
had
said,
the
sole
test
should
be
whether
the
connection
between
the
two
is
tenuous
or
not
and
if
it
is
not
tenuous
then
clearly
it
was
not
tenuous,
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter
so
far
as
the
court
should
be
concerned.
and
certainly
the
statements
which
were
made
were
not
so
extravagant
that
the
(inaudible)
--
that
the
defendant
should
be
held.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
--
both
concur
--
both
opinions
in
the
appellate
division
were
upheld
and
judge
fuld's
dissent
said
the
same
thing
to
mr.
justice
botein
that
there
was
a
close
and
legitimate
relationship
between
the
two
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there
are
no
differences
--
well,
i
suppose
they
are,
really.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
the
statute
as
construed
has
imposed
liability
of
us
--
upon
us
on
a
falsity
theory
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
let
me
put
it
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
let
me
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
let
me
put
it
this
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
let
me
put
it
this
way.
i
come
to
a
point
i
was
going
to
reserve
for
later.
i
think
the
statute
is
so
broad
that
you
have
the
guessing
game
on
to
it
--
under
it
which
this
court
prohibited
in
winters
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
against
new
york.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
your
honor,
if
a
statute
be
construed
as
presiding
justice
botein
and
judges
fuld
and
bergan
stated
namely,
if
there's
a
legitimate
and
close
relationship
between
the
past
news
event
and
the
present
event,
that's
the
end
of
it.
if
the
statute
be
so
construed,
i
say
that
that's
constitutionally
the
test
that
should
be
followed.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
they
did
not.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
i
am
suggesting
that
constitutionally,
that's
all
they
can
say
and
if
you
go
beyond
that,
if
you
go
to
a
question
of
truth
or
falsity,
at
that
point,
the
constitution
does
not
permit
it.
i
may
say
in
addition
when
mrs.
warren
and
brandeis
first
proposed
this
“right
of
privacy”
in
1890,
they
were
careful
to
observe
obviously
truth
or
falsity
has
nothing
to
do
with
these
matters.
the
american
law
institute
says
in
1867
dealing
with
“right
of
privacy”
states
specifically
in
its
comments
that
truth
or
falsity
has
nothing
to
do
with
this.
and
my
point
on
this
is
that
you
cannot
constitutionally
test
the
matter
of
privacy
on
the
ground
of
truth
or
falsity.
this
--
just
to
test
out
that
way.
last
night's
paper
at
an
article
on
big
fireball
startles
many
in
the
east
and
they
quoted
three
gentlemen,
dr.
thomas
nicholson,
chairman
of
the
hayden
planetarium
and
dr.
fred
l.
whipple,
director
of
the
smithsonian
astrophysical
observatory
and
dr.
c.t.
olivia,
president
of
the
american
meteor
society
all
with
conflicting
statements.
now
let's
suppose
that
as
a
practical
matter
one
of
the
reporters
for
the
evening
story
got
mixed
up
and
none
of
those
gentlemen
made
those
statements
whatsoever
so
that
it
was
completely
false
to
have
stated
that
they
made
those
statements.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
those
three
gentlemen
did
have
relevant
connection
to
a
story
about
a
meteor
and
that
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
matter
privacy
wise.
it
may
be
that
you're
going
to
get
into
libel
and
if
you
get
into
libel,
truth
or
to
--
falsity
is
the
test.
but
i'm
--
getting
the
head
of
my
(inaudible)
--
of
the
game
but
that's
really
what
i'm
(inaudible)
i'm
coming
to.
now,
i
have
really
two
initial
points
and
two
corollaries
problem.
first,
privacy
cannot
constitutionally
exist
for
a
public
fact
which
is
relevantly
connected
with
the
present
news
or
general
interest
event.
secondly,
the
privacy
cannot
constitutionally
exist
for
a
public
fact
period.
now
if
either
relevance
or
the
nature
--
the
public
nature
of
the
fact
be
the
only
two
tests
that
you
have,
you
don't
have
the
guessing
contest
which
was
condemned
in
winters
against
new
york.
and
all
we've
been
doing
in
this
case
for
10
and
a
half
years
frankly
is
guessing
as
to
where
we're
going.
and
i
suggest
however
that
as
between
the
two
tests
constitutionally
in
trying
to
put
aside
--
make
some
solution
to
the
“right
of
privacy”
on
the
one
hand
and
the
first
amendment
on
the
other
hand
that
it's
an
easier
solution
to
use
the
relevance
test
than
to
use
the
public
fact
test
because
with
the
public
fact
test,
you
have
the
constitutional
point
of
can
a
man
put
his
past
in
his
pocket.
can
you
say
that
after
awhile
a
public
event
which
has
been
reported,
he
can
say
to
the
press,
you
can't
touch
it
again?
it's
just
as
if
roy
riegels
on
his
1929
wrong
way
touchdown
which
was
most
embarrassing
to
say,
the
press
can't
mention
that
anymore,
this
is
in
the
past.
now
i
suggest,
this
is
a
slightly
tougher
question
to
decide
constitutionally
on
this
public
fact
although
i
think
it
is
the
correct
constitutional
solution
in
trying
to
harmonize
the
first
amendment
and
“right
of
privacy”.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
right.
all
we're
treating
here
your
honor
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
alright
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there,
i
would
say
--
i
would
say
that
an
entirely
different
tort
might
give
a
cause
of
action
against
that
publication
for
doing
that
but
i
think
the
tort
of
privacy
does
not,
that's
my
simple
point
on
that
because
there's
nothing
private
about
it
by
definition.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
at
that
point,
it
might
be
if
you're
stating
something
false
in
connection
with
this,
what
we're
doing
here,
intentional
falsehood.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
right
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
any
intentional
act
to
cause
harm
which
you
know
is
going
to
cause
harm
gives
a
separate
type
of
cause
of
action.
that's
covered
in
section
873
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
the
restatement.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
say
first,
they
didn't
know
it's
going
to
come
--
cause
harm
and
secondly,
they
had
--
they
didn't
know
there
was
anything
wrong
about
it.
at
the
time
this
article
was
published,
everybody
at
life
plus
the
checker
thought
it
was
entirely
true
and
correct.
and
even
at
the
trial,
prideaux
and
ecker
--
laura
ecker-ludwig
took
the
stand
and
say,
"in
our
judgment
this
article
is
true."
now,
i'm
--
passed
that
point
in
this
court
but
so
far
as
intention,
there
was
nothing
in
any
of
the
opinions
below
to
cast
any
aspersions
in
our
intentions
or
motives
in
this
case.
so
it's
not
a
malice
case.
this
is
a
case
where
you
made
a
mistake.
i
come
to
this
court
saying
that.
alright,
we
made
a
mistake.
and
i
say
the
fact
we
made
out
a
mistake
constitutionally
is
unimportant
when
you're
dealing
with
privacy.
it
comes
down
to
--
if
you
(inaudible)
--
if
you
treat
it
on
a
mistake
basis
and
on
truth
or
falsity,
what's
happened
the
law
of
libel,
you
don't
need
the
law
of
libel
anymore
and
the
safeguards,
it's
much
easier
to
sue
for
a
violation
of
your
“right
of
privacy”
but
all
the
defenses
that
have
been
set
up
in
the
libel
law,
disappeared.
let
me
illustrate
with
an
illustration
here.
here's
a
picture
of
a
golf
player
plays
in
--
out
of
a
trap.
his
face
is
sort
of
shaded.
it
has
the
thing
dirty
player
under
it
and
it
obviously
refers
to
south
africa's
gary
player
but
supposing
there's
been
a
mistake
made
and
this
isn't
mr.
player
at
all,
it's
an
amateur
partner
of
his
in
the
same
tournament.
now
at
that
point,
i
say
since
we're
still
dealing
with
something
relevant
to
that
tournament,
the
fact
you've
make
--
made
a
mistake
is
unimportant
privacy
wise.
if
they
made
a
mistake
libel
wise,
they're
heading
dirty
player
would
obviously
give
that
amateur
player
a
cause
of
action
because
ever
since
the
(inaudible)
jones
case,
there's
not
a
defense
to
a
libel
suit
and
say
he
didn't
know
about
it
but
i'm
suggesting
that
with
respect
to
this
if
there
has
been
an
error
made,
as
long
as
it's
relevant
to
the
tournament
that
you're
entitled
to
do
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
two
and
a
half
years
later
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
your
honor,
we
started
out
with
a
newsworthy
event,
a
play
on
broadway,
a
play
which
has
been
a
novel
of
that
sort,
it's
been
made
to
a
motion
picture.
when
we're
recording
on
that
fact,
if
you
want
to
forget
“right
of
privacy”,
i
say
we
can
report
anything
as
relevant
to
that
and
that
no
one
can
say
snag.
and
the
question
of
interest
or
non-interest,
that's
up
to
us
to
make
it
interesting
or
not
interesting.
that's
the
very
reason
we
have
in
the
first
amendment.
now,
it
so
happens
that
there
is
this
“right
of
privacy”.
whether
you
find
it
in
the
fourth
or
fifth
or
ninth
or
fourteenth,
i
don't
know.
we
recognized
it
and
now
for
it.
i'm
not
disputing
that.
when
the
two
come
together,
boom,
where
do
you
draw
the
line
as
to
when
they
go
(inaudible)
--
as
to
how
far
you're
going
to
go
on
it?
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes
i
do.
that's
0.2
in
our
brief
also.
i
say
it's
much
too
broad.
that's
pro
--
obviously,
mostly
a
matter
of
argument
in
the
briefs
or
haven't
touched
on
it
too
much
but
the
main
fact
--
mere
fact
that
we
have
had
the
guessing
contest
in
this
case
for
ten
and
a
half
years
through
all
these
courts
should
be
a
sufficient
indication
that
it
is
a
guessing
contest.
and
it's
much
too
broad
so
that
we
should
be
able
to
attack
it.
now,
i
still
come
down
to
either
you
have
as
a
solution
to
this
confrontation
of
the
two
rights.
as
a
solution,
the
question
of
is
it
relevant
to
a
present
news
event
and
do
you
know
about
it.
that's
the
solution
that
we've
mainly
suggested
in
our
brief.
it
was
the
solution
suggested
by
mr.
justice
botein
and
judge
fuld
and
judge
bergan
below.
that's
--
follows
along
your
new
york
times
against
sullivan
sort
of
a
--
primary
past
suit.
the
second
point
is,
if
it's
public
fact,
you
never
get
to
that
because
with
the
public
fact
--
well,
as
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
said,
"you
can't
do
anything
because
the
story
of
john
lindgren
is
part
of
the
history
of
our
community.
and
i
say
that
once
it's
part
of
the
history
of
the
community
that
you
can't
take
it
away.
but
again,
that's
a
more
difficult
point.
perhaps
the
type
of
statutes
you
might
have
to
deal
with
is
--
the
defense
law
for
instance
says
that
after
ten
years,
truth
is
no
longer
a
defense
for
libel.
they
in
effect
put
your
past
in
your
pocket
in
ten
years.
of
all
the
cases
that
have
passed
upon
it
in
this
country,
every
single
case
have
said,
you
can
continue
to
publish
with
two
exceptions.
one
was
the
case
of
the
reform
prostitute
on
california,
melvin
against
reid.
another
was
a
similar
criminal
identification
case
in
utah,
mau
against
rio
grande.
but
every
other
case
which
has
passed
upon
in
this
country
has
upheld
the
right
and
i
think
it's
a
constitutional
right
that
once
a
matter
gets
in
the
public
news,
it
stays
there.
now
mind
you
here,
we're
dealing
with
a
very
limited
area
of
the
law
of
privacy.
i'm
not
touching
intrusion
or
appropriation.
we're
dealing
with,
can
you
take
a
past
newsworthy
fact
and
relate
it
to
a
present
newsworthy
fact
even
though
you
slipped
off
and
telling
the
exact
nature
of
that
relationship.
but
if
the
relationship
be
not
tenuous,
i
say
that
we're
entitled
to
do
that,
(a)
because
it's
relevant
and
(b)
because
we
didn't
know
there's
anything
wrong
with
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
question
of
tenuous
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
of
relationship
your
honor
was
never
put
to
that
jury.
i
request
the
charge
on
that.
i
summed
up
on
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that
was
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
majority
opinions
of
the
appellate
division
didn't
think
that
this
non-tenuous
relationship
was
sufficient
as
the
defense.
indeed,
mr.
justice
rabin
in
one
concurring
opinion
said,
“quite
surely
they
could
have
mentioned
the
hill
family
if
they'd
wish
to
but
not
in
the
way
they
did."
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
now,
if
we
could
have
said
the
two
stories
are
strikingly
similar,
at
that
point,
if
you
can
mention
them,
privacy
goes
out
the
window.
from
then
on,
you're
testing
it
by
libel
and
not
by
privacy.
and
that's
the
reason
i
say
once
it's
relevant
you
can
mention
it
of
course.
and
the
way
in
which
you
mention
it
is
your
business
except
that
if
you're
defamatory,
you're
going
to
be
held
for
libel
but
don't
take
the
defenses
of
libel
away
by
the
backdoor
of
this
“right
of
privacy”
cause
of
action.
and
that's
in
essence
what's
been
happening.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it
says,
"for
trade
or
advertising
purposes."
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
i
say
the
new
york
courts
have
done
three
things
which
are
unconstitutional.
first,
they've
said
that
there
can
be
privacy
for
a
public
fact
and
this
was
a
public
fact.
secondly,
they
said
that
the
test
is
truth
or
falsity
and
i
say
that
has
no
relationship
to
privacy.
and
thirdly,
they've
said
that
the
test
must
be
motivation
to
increase
circulation
and
i
say
that
it
cannot
constitutionally
be
the
test
as
to
whether
we're
going
to
be
held
for
having
done
something
wrong
to
somebody.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
the
financing
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
primarily
it
came
from
(voice
overlap)
from
life.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
but
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
but
any
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
line
up
or
report
of
any
play
indeed
of
any
article
in
a
major
magazine
has
countrywide
circulation
always
has
the
indirect
effect
of
helping
promote
that
specific
or
novel
or
idea,
whatever
it
is
you're
talking
about.
but
that
certainly
cannot
be
the
test
as
an
advertising
news,
that's
an
incidental
promotional
test.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
i
say
if
new
york
has
said
that,
then
it
is
going
right
smack
dab
up
against
the
first
amendment.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
that
at
this
point,
we
are
entitled
if
that's
what
new
york
says,
the
statute
says,
we're
entitled
to
come
to
this
court
and
say,
"call
a
hold
to
it."
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
i
thought
i
had
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that
--
no
sir.
that
is
what
i'm
not
sure
of
and
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
but
that
isn't
the
point
presented
by
this
case
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
to
be
frank.i
think
eventually
you
may
get
to
it
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
and
one
of
my
reasons
for
pointing
out
of
this
--
in
our
case
is
that
you've
got
large
areas
such
as
that
still
opened
as
to
what
the
facts
are.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
let
me
give
you
the
test
that
i've
used
for
25
years
with
time
(inaudible).
i've
said
number
one,
you
have
no
right
to
use
anybody's
name
or
picture.
number
two,
you
can
do
it
if
there's
a
reason
for
it.
and
all
i'm
trying
to
do
is
articulate,
its
been
--
to
what
the
reason
is.
now
if
the
reason
--
if
you
have
a
reason
for
it,
i
think
you
can
do
it.
if
you
haven't
got
a
reason,
you
can't
do
it.
our
reason
for
the
hill
case
is
we're
reporting
on
the
play.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
i
think
constitutionally,
you
have
to
have
some
sort
of
a
reason
for
it.
at
least
that
is
what
we
have
been
following
down.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
think
at
that
point
it
could
well
be
but
i
still
would
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
see
that
the
reason
for
doing
it
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
you
have
that
type
of
case
as
to
--
if
you
follow
the
fellow
at
work
and
you
follow
him
down
the
street
and
it's
a
public
place
and
so
far
so
good.
and
then
he
goes
into
his
home
and
that's
the
end
of
it
right
there.
i
think
we
are
in
accord.
when
you
get
into
the
home,
then
you
have
an
intrusion
aspect
which
comes
--
the
different
end
of
things.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
you
know
this
matter
of
news,
general
interest
is
as
much
news
and
doesn't
have
to
be
that
this
happened
today
in
an
--
that
new
sense.
so
it's
a
general
interest
event
that
we're
talking
about
really.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
not
so
far
as
privacy
once
it's
come
out
into
the
public
at
that
point.
now
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
the
newspaper
doesn't
make
the
news.
the
news
is
reported
in
the
newspaper.
when
you've
got
the
cart
before
the
horse
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
lot
of
journalism
schools
teach?
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
this
is
why
i
tried
to
point
out
the
question
with
which
you're
presenting
is
a
very
narrow
one,
on
a
public
fact
related
to
a
public
thing.
if
you
really
want
to
have
all
the
various
facets
of
privacy,
you
have
the
intrusion
cases
right
off
the
bat.you
have
in
the
appropriation
cases.
you
put
a
young
lady
and
put
her
on
a
bag
of
flowers,
they
did
in
the
robertson
case,
obviously
there's
no
relevance
and
you
know
what's
you're
doing,
you
should
be
held
under
statute.
but
if
you
want
to
try
and
saw
in
this
one
case
every
privacy
problem
that
exist,
we
can
be
talking
about
this
for
a
week
because
there
are
multitude
of
them.
and
all
i'm
really
saying
is
that
with
this
specific
problem
on
past
news
related
to
present
news
that
relevance
is
the
test.
and
if
it
were
not
for
privacy
on
your
constitutional
question
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
it
were
not
for
privacy,
obviously
you
could
go
ahead
and
do
that
and
then
it's
a
question
of
finding
the
same
balance
that
your
honors
found
in
new
york
timesagainst
sullivan
as
to
where
the
balance
comes
between
these
two
opposing
forces.
and
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
balance
must
depend
on
this
case
on
relevance
plus
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
we
accept
that
your
honor.
we
don't
challenge
that
at
all.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
say
the
standard
at
least
in
a
case
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well
--
but
all
i
can
say
your
honor
is
the
standard
at
least
in
a
case
when
you're
dealing
with
an
event
of
present
interest
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
you're
going
to
relate
something
in
the
past
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that
is
the
play
or
broadway
opening
that
certainly
is
of
general
news
interest.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
you're
going
to
relate
to
that
past
news
worthy
facts.
i
say
that
you
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it's
been
in
the
news.
it's
a
public
event
so
that
privacy
no
longer
exists
for
that.
i'd
say
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
in
that
situation,
we
--
the
only
test
is
relevance
and
not
truth
or
falsity
so
that
the
fact
that
we
may
have
without
knowing
it,
misstated
the
nature
of
the
relationship
is
constitutionally
immaterial
i
was
saying.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
certainly,
the
past
event
was
so
similar
to
the
present
play
that
in
talking
about
the
play,
it
was
relevant
to
consider
as
to
whether
this
past
have
had
anything
to
do
with
it.
certainly,
we
could
have
said
they're
strikingly
similar
and
at
that
point,
the
privacy
would've
disappeared
and
that
no
one
would
contend
that
there
was
any
cause
of
action
against
this.
and
i'm
saying
the
difference
between
saying
strikingly
similar
and
inspired
is
so
or
reenacted,
it's
so
small
that
we
shouldn't
be
charged
$30,000
for
it
and
we
shouldn't
be
worrying
about
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
alright.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
say,
you
start
off,
once
they
are
relevant,
you
never
get
to
the
question
of
intent.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
if
they're
relevant
that's
--
i'm
trying
to
get
to
that.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
now
i'm
suggesting
that
either
relevance
or
a
past
public
fact,
either
one
is
a
defense.
i
think
it's
a
more
difficult
constitutional
question
as
this
past
public
fact
because
of
the
reformed
prostitute
type
of
case
as
to
whether
you
should
be
able
to
do
that.
but
i'm
perfectly
clear
that
if
there's
relevance
and
that's
precisely
what
was
said
by
the
dissenting
opinions
of
the
two
courts
below
if
there's
relevance
and
the
connection
is
not
tenuous
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
you
never
get
to
the
question
of
knowledge.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
because
otherwise
for
--
if
--
mind
you,
this
is
a
non-defamatory
article.
they
said
the
families
were
heroes.
on
every
item
that
you
publish
or
you
can
check
any
front
page
of
any
paper
on
the
interior
pages.
if
you're
going
to
have
a
test
of
beyond
relevance
to
go
into
--
shall
we
interrogate
as
to
knowledge,
my
goodness,
with
every
--
perfectly
innocuous
news
item
that
appears
in
the
papers,
you're
going
to
have
to
have
a
dual
test
of
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
you
still
have
an
entirely
independent
tort
of
intentional
falsehood
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
here
so
that
if
someone
intentionally
says
something
false
and
goes
out
to
damage
someone,
you're
liable
for
those
special
damages.
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
intentional
falsehood
or
libel
are
going
to
be
in
anyway
hampered
by
what
you
rule
in
this
case.
those
are
independent
remedies.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
to
bring
it
under
a
privacy
remedy
begs
the
question
that
gives
a
false
test
and
i
still
come
down
to
tom
prideaux
who
said,
the
question
of
privacy
never
crossed
my
mind
because
it
was
a
matter
of
public
record.
he
used
that
test
and
i
think
he
was
correct
in
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
said
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
now,
you're
creating
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
you're
trying
to
test
a
value
of
judgment
as
to
the
content
of
the
news
which
is
the
very
reason
why
the
first
amendment
was
set
up
since
you
couldn't.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
all
i
can
say
is
that
that
was
precisely
what
i
say
that
they
can't
make
it
a
tort.
but
it
is
not
made
a
tort
because
of
the
matter
of
presentation.
if
it
is,
you
are
right
on
first
amendment
grounds
because
you're
passing
a
value
of
judgment
as
to
what
we've
done
to
make
the
article
interesting.
and
we're
entitled
to
make
it
interesting
in
our
way
as
long
as
we
don't
trespass
rights.
thank
you.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
can
i
say
one
more
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question.
the
word
intentional
should
be
omitted.
it's
falsehood
for
profit.
there
was
no
proof
of
intentional
here.
it
was
never
given
to
the
jury
is
what
i
requested.
so
if
the
statute
has
been
construed
on
falsehood
to
increase
circulation,
period.
and
i
say
those
two
tests
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
should
not
be
used.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it
was
not
given
to
the
jury
in
this
case.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes
it
is
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
start
this
term
where
we
left
off
last
term
with
mr.
justice
white's
question
concerning
an
intentional
falsehood.
i
think
your
questions
are
directed
to
that
and
our
simple
position
is
that
new
york
has
not
created
a
cause
of
action
for
intentional
falsehood
and
that
the
omission
of
intent
and
falsity
is
fatal.
and
we
start
with
a
standard
that
non-defamatory
language
about
a
public
fact
which
we
have
here
is
protected
by
the
constitution
unless
there
is
both
falsity
and
knowledge
of
falsity.
let
me
turn
to
the
new
york
cases
attempting
to
discuss
them
in
the
order
that
the
court's
questions
were
put
to
us,
first,
in
the
question
of
truth.
the
new
york
courts
have
enjoined
truthful
and
newsworthy
accounts
without
intent.
and
i
turn
to
the
case
of
mrs.
blumenthal
and
this
case
went
to
our
court
of
appeals
and
mrs.
blumenthal
in
the
early
1930s
was
selling
bread
on
orchard
street.
she
was
pictured
in
a
travel
log
for
approximately
six
seconds
out
of
a
17-minute
travel
log.
the
court
enjoined
that
presentation.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
the
appellee's
brief
said
there
are
ethnic
comments
and
gags
and
derisive
commentary.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
let
me
read
what
two
of
the
justices
of
the
appellate
division,
mr.
justice
o'malley
and
mr.
justice
finch
who
viewed
the
picture
said
took
place.
it
is
further
shown
that
no
time
displaying
this
picture
appear
alone
but
on
the
contrary,
the
pictures
of
other
individuals
appear
on
the
side,
in
front
or
in
back
of
her.
in
no
part
of
the
picture
either
by
sound,
title,
subtitle
or
otherwise
is
any
reference
what
so
--
whatever
made
to
her
or
any
of
her
actions
or
emotions.
and
nothing
whatever
is
reproduced
to
emphasize
her
likeness,
occupation
or
actions
other
than
the
usual
silent
reproduction
of
life
and
events
in
that
particular
quarter
of
the
city.
it
is
further
shown
that
at
no
time
in
the
picture
is
plaintiff
depicted
in
a
foolish,
unnatural
or
undignified
manner.
there
is
no
tendency
to
hold
here
up
to
public
ridicule
or
contempt.
there
is
no
distortion
or
exaggeration
of
a
natural
and
normal
physical
conditions
which
obtained
or
of
the
events
portrayed.
the
parties
posing
as
guides
and
school
teachers
engaged
in
a
dialogue
which
consist
largely
a
million
ounce
in
the
places,
buildings
etcetera
in
the
sections
through
which
they
pass
but
there
is
no
statement
or
announcement
in
the
dialogue,
billing
or
otherwise
referring
in
any
manner
to
the
picture
of
the
plaintiff.
so
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
but
these
were
two
members
of
the
court.
the
court
viewed
the
picture,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
this
is
the
description
by
the
two
dissenting
members
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
as
to
what
they
saw.
the
--
i
think
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
that
the
comments
and
complaint
in
appellee's
brief
were
taken
from
the
complaint
which
were
rebutted
by
an
actual
scene
of
the
picture.
now,
if
any
further
--
in
anything
further
on
that,
you
can
turn
to
the
comment
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
1952
in
the
gautier
case
concerning
mrs.
blumenthal
and
her
selling
bread
in
--
bread
on
orchard
street.
and
there,
the
court
said,
“the
blumenthal
case
supra
illustrates
the
area
of
privacy
which
may
not
be
invaded
even
in
this
modern
era
of
television,
when
travelling
upon
the
public
highway
may
expect
to
be
televised
but
only
as
an
incidental
part
of
the
general
scene,
so
when
attending
a
public
event,
such
as
a
professional
football
game,
they
expect
to
be
televised
in
the
status
in
which
he
attends.
if
a
mere
spectator,
he
may
be
taken
as
part
of
the
general
audience
but
may
not
be
picked
out
of
the
crowd
alone,
thrust
upon
the
screen
and
unduly
featured
for
public
view.”
now,
let
me
illustrate
what
i
think
that
means.
it's
the
new
york
times,
a
couple
of
sundays
ago,
this
one
picture
here
of
a
race
riot
in
san
francisco.
there's
another
picture
down
here
of
a
soldier
in
vietnam.
those
two
pictures
are
as,
to
use
the
language
of
gautier,
may
not
be
picked
out
of
a
crowd
alone,
thrust
upon
the
screen
and
unduly
featured
for
a
public
view.
so
strictly
under
the
language,
covering
mrs.
blumenthal's
case,
as
going
again
in
the
gautier
case
in
1952,
these
two
pictures
are
subject
to
the
same
injunction
which
issued
in
the
blumenthal
case
and
the
person
publishing
them
is
--
is
subject
to
a
crime.
and
as
what
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
it
may
well
be
that
they
will
take
their
chance
on
that
but
as
of
the
present,
on
a
strict
reading
of
their
case,
that's
precisely
what
it
means.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
a
travel
log
of
new
york
city
which
took
up
17
minutes,
showing
scenes
throughout
the
city,
happened
to
have
had
her
in
one
scene
for
six
seconds.
if
that
suffice,
so
the
court
issued
an
injunction.
now,
it's
a
current
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it's
a
--
the
word
“newsworthy”,
your
honor
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
it's
not
only
current
news.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
don't
know
when
this
picture
of
the
soldier
in
vietnam
was
taken.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there
are
different
degrees
of
newsworthiness,
your
honor,
a
matter
of
general
interest
comes
within
the
normal
term
“newsworthy”.
if
you're
going
to
limit
that
term
solely
to
current
news
events,
that's
one
thing.
i
do
not
think
that
the
term
can
be
so
limited.
certainly,
a
matter
of
general
interest,
such
as
what
goes
on
in
new
york,
should
be
covered
by
the
constitution,
a
non-defamatory
language.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
the
question
you
put
last
time,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
may
first
say
that
i
think
it's
extremely
unlikely
that
any
picture
which
resulted
will
be
such
that
it
will
be
of
enough
interest
so
that
you'd
show
it.
secondly,
i
do
think
that
you
do
have
your
limited
that
you
cannot,
by
lawful
means,
do
harm
to
someone,
go
and
repeatedly
taking
pictures
of
him
right
and
left.
and
it
maybe
that
it'll
get
up
to
the
disinterested
malevolence
of
mr.
justice
holmes
in
actually
using
lawful
means
to
so
harass
someone
that
they
are
harassed.
but
absent
that,
if
you
want
to
take
a
series
of
picture
of
someone
in
a
public
street
on
a
public
fact,
and
--
and
put
that
on
the
screen,
i
think
you're
entitled
to
absent
intentional
falsehood.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
think
you
might
reach
the
point
where
you
have
that
disinterested
malevolence
that
you're
intentionally
trying
to
do
harm
to
here
even
though
by
legal
means
so
that
you'd
have
another
tort
created,
the
same
tort
that
mr.
justice
holmes
referred
to
in
the
atlanta
bank
--
bank
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
case,
256
u.s.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
thought
that
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
will
call,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
i
didn't
say
the
statute.
that's
the
entirely
different
tort,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
do
not
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
say
that
this
will
bring
the
statute
into
play.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
tort
would
be
a
prima
facie
tort
of
intentional
infliction
of
a
harm,
and
you
know
that
you're
doing
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
entirely
a
separate
tort.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it's
the
right
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
atlanta
bank
case
in
256
u.s.
350,
358.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
anyone
who
uses
lawful
means
with
the
sole
intent
of
harming
someone
else
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
then
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
we're
dealing
with
a
private
fact,
i
was
careful
to
state
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
the
none
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
or
not
on
this
question
of
trade
or
advertising.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
the
present
statute
is
so
broad
that
it
literally
covers
anything
on
--
on
the
trade.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
but
i
would
certainly
would
not.
and
i
--
and
i
think
the
normal
privacy
case
outside
of
this
statute,
your
honor,
stops
going
into
a
person's
home,
well,
you
have
a
non-public
fact
then
and
that's
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
why
i
said
non-defamatory
language
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
as
to
a
public
fact
is
entitled
to
constitutional
protections.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
would
think
he
would
be
entitled
constitutional
protection.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
think
there
is
a
constitutional
prohibition
against
that,
your
honor,
going
to
someone's
home.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it
depends
whether
the
public
is
allowed
in
the
office,
if
the
public
is
allowed
then
it's
fine.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
certainly,
when
you
get
to
the
--
our
reception
room,
yes.
when
you
get
to
the
--
the
next
office
back,
i
have
a
more
difficult
problem
as
to
whether
that's
part
of
the
public
or
you're
private
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
but
then
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
as
to
you
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
i
think
what
we've
come
down
to
here
that
this
phrase
“privacy”
is
a
misnomer
because
we're
really
talking
about
intentional
falsehood
rather
than
privacy
even
though
the
statute
has
that
label
and
investigating
as
to
whether
which
it
could
view
constitutionally,
whether
you
created
a
cause
of
action
for
intentional
falsehood
under
the
guise
of
this
statute
because
i'm
limiting
to
myself
to
public
facts,
the
facts
we
have
here
as
the
hill
family
was
a
public
fact
as
opposed
to
a
private
fact.
and
all
i'm
saying
here
is
that
when
you
have
non-defamatory
language
about
a
public
fact
that
is
constitutionally
protected
unless
and
until
you
have
both
falsity
and
knowledge
of
falsity.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
but
obviously,
the
original
enactment
was
passed
in
order
to
prevent
you
from
publishing
a
young
lady's
photograph
and
a
bag
of
flower
but
then
was
expanded
beyond
that.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
don't.
i
do
not
think
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
let
--
let
me
put
this
way.
if
you
have
non-defamatory
language
about
a
--
a
public
fact,
that's
the
typical
free
speech,
free
press
language
you're
talking
about
as
opposed
to
defamatory
language.
now,
at
that
point,
absent
falsity
and
intentional
falsity,
i
say
it's
protected
because
both
of
your
libel
and
privacy
in
a
way
come
under
the
thing,
the
constitution
does
not
protect
intentional
falsity.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
but
a
public
fact,
your
honor
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i'm
saying
the
language
concerning
this
public
fact
even
though
you
may
erroneously
report
--
report
it,
if
it's
non-defamatory,
must
be
tested
both
by
falsity
and
by
knowledge
of
falsity.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i'm
saying
that
if
you're
talking
about
negligent
falsity
at
that
point,
that's
when
the
constitution
interposes
because
public
discuss
--
discussion
of
non-defamatory
nature
is
a
sufficient
importance
so
that
you
should
not
impose
a
check
on
this
unless
there
is
both
falsity
and
intent.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
i
include
recklessness
with
--
with
intentional
falsity
of
course.
well,
that
--
that
goes
without
saying
it.
so
--
so
that
--
that
is
the
standard
that
i'm
--
i'm
supposing
here
that
was
being
followed.
that
was
the
new
york.
of
course
first,
we
start
with
something
true
as
with
mrs.
blumenthal
which
has
been
enjoined.
the
very
test
of
fictionalization
is
not
one
of
truth
or
falseness
--
falsity.
it's
embellishment
or
exaggeration,
so
that
you
will
have
articles
which
are
basically
true
but
which
involve
elements
of
--
of
embellishment
which
have
been
prohibited
or
--
or
to
our
ability,
found.
the
sutton
against
hearst
case,
which
we
have
in
our
brief,
the
red
rose
case
--
the
red
rose.
there,
the
majority
found
there
was
fictionalization
but
the
dissenting
opinion
by
then
presiding
justice
peck
and
mr.
justice
shientag
said,
“well,
on
the
facts
before
us,
the
article
is
basically
true
even
though
there
is
embellishment.”
so
that
i
that
suggest
to
you
that
with
the
fictionalization
cases
by
themselves,
it
is
not
a
test
of
truth
or
falsity.
and
even
the
binns
case
again
which
started
this
fictionalization,
at
the
end
of
the
case,
they
had
a
very
significant
little
passage.
it
is
urged
that
there
is
danger
of
serious
trouble
in
the
practical
enforcement
of
any
rule
which
maybe
adopted
in
construing
and
enforcing
the
statue
so
far
as
it
relates
to
purposes
of
trade.
if
there
is
any
basis
for
the
suggestion
of
danger
enforced
in
a
part
of
the
statute
or
consideration,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
legislature
to
repeal
such
part
thereof
or
so
modify
it
as
to
define
with
a
greater
particularity
what
it
intends
should
be
prohibited.
but
the
statute
was
never
amended
despite
that
suggestion
by
the
court.
i
may
say
in
that
regard
that
just
as
this
court
in
the
new
york
time
case
used
coleman
against
maclennan
in
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
as
a
guide
to
the
common
law
that
i
would
suggest
that
a
similar
use
maybe
made
of
donahue
against
warner
brothers
in
the
supreme
court
of
utah.
that
case
construed
a
new
--
a
utah
statute
practically
identical
with
the
new
york
statute
here.
and
for
the
very
reasons
which
i
have
been
putting
forward
to
this
court,
found
that
it
have
to
be
construed
to
mean
use
of
a
name
or
picture
solely
in
connection
with
--
with
the
sale
of
a
commodity
because
otherwise,
they
found
the
same
constitutional
difficulties
which
i
am
urging
upon
you
here.
so,
i
suggest
that
that
donahue
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
can
be
used
as
the
model
much
as
you
did
with
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
in
the
new
york
times.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that
was
decided
in
1954
and
they
ended
up
by
saying,
“the
twilight
areas
of
uncertainty
between
the
alternative
as
such
that
a
publisher
would
have
to
be
constantly
negotiating
a
hazardous
course
between
educational
and
none
educational,
fact
and
fiction,
public
and
private
character
from
one
quandary
to
another
so
that
the
situation
would
be
both
impracticable
and
intolerable
and
go
right
along
the
same
constitutional
theory
that
i'm
following
here.
so
i
--
i
merely
suggest
that
that's
a
possible
--
be
of
possible
utility
to
the
court
on
--
on
this
question.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it's
cited
in
the
brief,
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
donahue
and
it's
in
the
reply
brief,
yes.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir.
now,
on
the
question
of
standing
on
this
matter
of
truth,
i
say
that
we
have
standing
for
two
reasons.
first,
we
have,
up
to
the
time
we
got
to
this
court
throughout
all
the
new
york
courts
stated
that
the
life
article
was
true,
in
the
broader
sense
of
the
word
“truth”.
surely
that
there
was
the
ambiguous
inaccuracy
on
the
word
“enactment
--
reenactment”.
but
aside
from
that,
the
fact
that
the
play
was
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
hill
incident
as
testified
to
at
the
trial
and
the
fact
that
it
basically
--
merely
was
a
--
a
picture
of
a
family
being
terrorized
by
three
convicts.
we
made
the
point
throughout
that
the
article
was
basically
true.
i
think
myself
that
is
the
reason
why
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
both
opinions
below
including
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
raiben
which
said
that
even
if
--
if
it's
true,
you
still
going
to
be
libel.
it
was
an
answer
to
that
contention
of
ours.
so
that
i
say
that
on
that
broader
test
of
truth
having
put
that
forward
throughout
the
courts
below,
we
have
standing
to
raise
this
question
of
--
of
truth.
i
may
say
that
on
this
broader
question
of
truth,
this
question
of
standard
to
illustrate,
people
say
that
the
british
and
the
american
libel
law
are
the
same
and
that
each
has
a
defense
of
truth.
that's
true
when
you
ask
completely
false
in
a
way.
i
--
if
i
should
write
that
johnny
jones
stole
a
watch
last
tuesday
and
i
come
in
the
court
and
prove
that
johnny
jones
stole
a
clock
last
tuesday,
that's
a
defense
under
our
law,
it
is
not
a
defense
under
british
law.
or
if
i
find
that
johnny
jones
--
truth
of
johnny
jones
stole
a
watch
last
wednesday
instead
of
tuesday,
it
is
not
a
defense
under
british
law.
and
you
can
refer
to
gatley
section
257
in
that
regard.
so,
it
depends
whether
you're
using
the
narrower
test
of
truth
or
a
broader
test
of
truth
in
applying
these
standards.
in
any
event,
we
did
raise
that
and
it
seems
to
me,
it
does
give
us
standing
to
raise
the
point
of
truth.
secondly,
under
button
and
dombrowski,
in
this
court,
when
you
have
a
statute
which
has
been
applied
to
enjoin,
as
in
mrs.
blumenthal,
a
truthful
account
and
in
other
cases
which
we
cited
in
our
--
in
our
brief.
when
you
have
this
statute,
it
does
have
an
inhibitory
effect.
and
i
say
that
at
that
point,
this
court
should
raise
the
point
and
go
into
it.
i
ensure
that
ever
since
the
youssoupoff
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
i
will
go
into
in
a
minute,
the
c.b.s.
has
been
more
than
careful
in
trying
to
hold
back
in
some
other
things
it
has
done.
it's
impossible
to
affect
to
--
really
to
appraise
the
effect
of
the
decisions
but
we
do
know
that
they
do
take
place
and
the
smaller
publishers
just
can't
afford
to
be
coming
up
to
this
court.
in
this
case
alone,
this
is
the
fifth
appeal
we've
argued
and
two
trials
and
we've
been
at
it
for
11
years.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
record
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
willfully
--
well,
all
i'm
saying
is
you
--
you
need
both
falsity
and
intent
if
you
have
non-defamatory
language
because
intentional
falsity
has
no
constitutional
protection
and
shouldn't
have
and
the
law
of
libel
is
part
of
that
except
that
you
allow
the
states
to
presume
both
intent
and
falsity
except
when
you're
dealing
with
a
public
official,
when
you
yank
that
presumption
back
and
say,
"go
back
and
prove
intent
and
prove
--
and
prove
falsity
because
it's
important
when
you're
talking
about
public
officials.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
do
not,
no.
except
that
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
you
may
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
if
the
libel
is
concerning
public
officials
and
perhaps,
you'll
extend
it
to
public
figures
and
public
issues
that
is
--
other
--
be
coming
up
in
other
cases
of
course
but
--
but
you
still
come
back
to
intentional
falsehood.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
all
i'm
saying
is
you
have
to
prove
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
might
be
--
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that's
so
and
moreover
which
the
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
it's
probably
a
question
for
the
jury
as
to
wherever
it's
reckless
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
if
the
jury
found
falsity
and
based
on
the
facts
you've
stated
found
reckless
indifference
to
whether
it
was
false
or
not,
i
think
that
verdict
would
be
upheld
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir,
of
course.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
question
of
intent,
first,
on
the
cases
other
than
our
case
and
secondly
to
our
case.
i
think
it
is
clear
beyond
the
--
from
a
venture
of
a
doubt
that
this
question
of
intent
or
knowledge
of
falsity
or
even
malice
or
certainly
knowledge
of
falsity
is
utterly
falling
to
this
question
of
privacy
as
interpreted
by
the
new
york
courts.
and
the
clearest
example
i
can
give
you
is
the
thompson
against
close-up
case,
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
where
a
magazine
used
a
wrong
picture
and
a
summary
disposition
of
the
case
was
denied
because,
said
the
court,
“it
may
be
found
that
the
publication
although,
perhaps,
by
mistake,
was
--
was
published
in
order
to
increase
circulation.”
so
that,
the
intent
end
of
it
was
totally
thrown
out.
the
youssoupoff
decisions
and
case
where
the
admitted
assassin
of
rasputin
coming
into
court
and
saying,
“you
didn't
tell
it
correctly.”
intent
was
following
to
that
case
throughout.
it
reached
the
point
initially
whether
it's
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
by
the
plaintiff
which
was
almost
granted.
two
concurring
judges
in
our
appellant
division
said,
“he
should've
gotten
it
because
there
was
embellishment,”
but
no
discussion
of
intent
whatsoever.
it
went
back
to
trial.
and
we
found
in
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
county
trying
as
to
whether
the
admitted
assassin
of
rasputin
and
to
have
his
--
have
the
story
correctly
told
and
the
matter
was
put
to
a
jury
are
the
test
of
charge
for
the
juries,
in
appendix
to
my
brief,
no
question
of
intent
raised
throughout.
and
the
only
question
given
to
the
jury
was
truth
or
falsity.
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
the
judge
--
trial
judge
specifically
said,
"malice
is
not
a
part
of
this."
so
that
i
say
it
clearly
appears
from
the
youssoupoff
case
and
those
decisions
that
intent
is
--
is
not
a
necessary
element,
no
scienter
under
this
new
york
statute.
the
most
recent
decision
of
that
is
the
spahn
case
by
our
appellate
division
in
1965
and
at
the
end
of
that,
it
said,
"if
the
publication,
however,
by
intention
per
report
or
so
format,
is
neither
factual
nor
historical,
the
statute
applies.
and
if
the
subject
is
11
person,
his
written
consent
must
be
obtained.”
so
that
it's
clear
from
other
cases
that
intent
is
not
a
portion
of
this
crime.
and
this
is
a
crime
were
talking
about.
now,
let's
see
what
happened
in
this
case.
i
got
my
first
indication
of
what
was
going
to
happen
when
i
made
a
motion
to
dismiss.
they
--
specifically
on
the
ground
that
intent
had
not
been
proved.
and
the
trial
judge
denied
that
and
said,
"i
think
we
better
put
up
to
the
jury
whether
the
article
is
true
or
false."
then
we
got
the
summation.
and
my
second
point
of
summation
dealt
with
intent
and
that
they
should
prove
that
we
knew
what
we
were
doing.
and
immediately,
counsel
for
appellee
got
up
and
interrupted
my
summation
and
said,
"this
is
quite
erroneous,"
and
trial
judge
said,
“well,
i
will
instruct
on
that."
then
we
got
to
the
charge.
i
had
a
specific
request
to
charge
on
intent,
request
number
six.

311,
your
honor.
“even
if
you
do
find
that
the
statements
in
the
life
article
concerning
plaintiffs
were
wholly
fictitious,
you
must
nevertheless
return
a
verdict,
the
defendant,
time,
inc.,
if
you
also
find
that
time,
inc.
published
those
statements
in
the
belief
that
they
were
true.”
stating
conversely,
“you
may
not
return
a
verdict
in
favor
of
either
plaintiff
against
time,
inc.
for
having
used
their
names
either
for
trade
purposes
or
for
advertising
purposes,
unless
you
were
satisfied
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
life
article
was
pure
fiction
regarding
plaintiff's
and
that
time,
inc.'s
employees
knew
it
was
a
fiction
at
the
time
the
article
was
published.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
your
honor,
we
put
both
the
writer
who
wrote
the
article
and
the
researcher
who
checked
it
on
the
stand.
both
of
them
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there
was
no
other
testimony
by
anybody
else.
i
had
one
editor
in
court.
i
spoke
to
the
plaintiff.
i've
announced
to
the
judge
he's
in
court
if
anybody
wants
to
--
wants
to
examine
it
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
and
no
one
did.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
but
i
thought
that
would
have
the
writer
and
the
researcher,
the
two
people
who
had
to
deal
with
the
article,
both
of
them
testified
that
in
their
judgment
at
the
trail,
the
article
was
true
and
at
the
time
they
wrote
it.
they
thought
it
was
true
and
correct.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
sir
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
there
was
no
objection
to
the
instruction,
the
--
the
court
just
didn't
charge
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
i
specifically
accepted
to
the
failure
of
the
charge.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that
defendant,
time,
inc.'s
employees
knew
it
was
fiction
at
the
time
it
was
published.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
precisely
my
--
my
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
now,
we're
--
we're
talking
about
deemed
process
false
like
case.
that's
in
essence
what
we've
reduced
this
case
to.
and
--
and
as
he
said,
“it
is
high
time
that
we
realized
what
we
are
you
doing
and
give
some
consideration
to
the
question
of
where
if
anywhere
we
ought
to
call
a
halt.”
and
he
characterized
those
cases,
and
i'm
reading
from
my
original
brief,
page
23,
gone
as
the
defensive
truth
and
the
defendant
is
held
liable
for
the
publication
of
entirely
accurate
statements
of
fact
without
any
wrongful
motive.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
but
he
had
not,
your
honor,
i'm
just
getting
to
that.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
because
what
the
trial
court
said
was,
"i
give
it
to
you,
the
jury,
to
pass
on
whether
the
statements
in
the
article
constituted
fiction."
and
then
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
but
whether
the
statement
in
the
article
constituted
fiction
and
that
isn't
--
that
isn't
a
--
a
question
of
--
of
intent
there.
and
then,
the
jury
came
back.
they
were
confused
about
this
work
trade
and
they
said,
“we
like
to
know
some
more
about
it.”
and
at
that
time,
i
think
mr.
garment,
representing
the
appellee,
made
two
significant
statements
which
pointed
out
his
position
and
the
court
followed
him.
first,
he
said,
“our
claim
is
that
the
total
article
must
be
read
and
the
jury
must
determine
whether
it
conveyed
the
basically
false
impression
as
to
the
relationship
of
the
hill
family
to
the
desperate
hours,
that's
page
306
of
the
record.
and
then
the
court
said,
“well,
we're
going
to
charge
that,
the
thing
is
covered,"
and
then
--
then
mr.
garment
said,
"your
honor,
if
they
are
telling
news,
if
they
are
telling
news,
purporting
to
tell
news
but
have
as
the
basis
for
the
use
of
the
individual's
name
something
that
is
furious
or
essentially
false,
that
we
contend,"
and
i
think
the
law
is
clear,
“it
is
for
trade
purposes.”
so,
it
is
purely
a
falsity
test,
and
it's
the
same
falsity
test
which
was
applied
in
youssoupoff
and
indeed,
it
is
the
falsity
test
which
is
called
for
under
the
prior
appellate
decisions
in
new
york.
so,
all
i'm
really
saying
is
that
--
that
the
question
of
intent
never
entered
this
case
and
doesn't
enter
in
new
york
law
so
far
as
this
question
of
privacy
is
concerned.
and
that's
a
fatal
omission.
now,
when
we
got
to
the
appellate
division
in
this
case,
again,
on
intent,
we
--
we
had
mr.
justice
stevens
saying,
"the
defendant
merely
concluded
that
basically,
the
play
was
a
reenactment
and
so
stated."
again,
there's
no
question
of
intent.
it's
a
question
--
we
concluded
that
it
was
reenactment
and
so
stated.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
but
the
charge
to
the
jury,
your
honor,
you
must
find
that
the
statements
concerning
the
plaintiffs
in
the
article
constituted
fiction.
it's
a
question
of
truth
or
falsity
on
that.
and
short
fiction
connotes
in
the
ways
in
fiddling
with
the
facts
but
there
is
nothing
in
any
of
the
--
of
the
appellate
decisions
in
new
york
on
this
question
of
intent.
intent
is
entirely
disregarded
and
--
and
i
think
the
--
the
spahn
case
which
i've
read
to
you,
the
youssoupoff
case
that
we've
gone
through
and
thompson
against
close-up.
and
they
said
--
they
may
have
--
they
may
perhaps
published
something
by
mistake.
this
is
a
wrong
picture
case.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
the
court
knew
perfectly
well
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
how
they
to
knowledge.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
because
in
regarding
punitive
damage,
then
he
got
knowledge
there
alright
and
that
this
was
done
knowingly
or
through
failure
to
make
a
reasonable
investigation.
so,
he
got
the
punitive
damage,
intent
and
knowledge
came
right
in,
intent
plus
negligence.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir,
they
did.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
jury
award
on
damage
was
set
aside,
your
honor,
because
of
the
--
the
evidence
which
was
put
in
which
--
which
went
against
us
so
far
and
we're
so
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
do.
i
do.
and
all
you
have
is
compensatory.
that's
all
that
was
awarded.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
that
was
set
aside.
the
jury
verdict
was
set
aside
and
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right
because
on
the
new
trial,
this
whole
award
of
damage
by
a
judge
trying
without
a
jury
was
for
compensatory
damages.
so
the
question
of
punitive
damage
is
no
--
no
longer
here.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
it's
one
on
negligence.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
and
it's
a
strange
doctrine
that
you're
going
to
have
punitive
damages
on
negligence.
and
yet
that
is
--
that
is
precisely
what
we
have
here.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it's
synonymous
with
embellishment
or
exaggeration.
it's
a
funny
type
of
falsehood.
it
isn't
really
true
or
falsehood.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it's
not
intentional.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there's
not
the
slightest
doubt
of
that.
under
the
cases
in
general,
and
on
--
and
as
applied
in
our
case,
intent
is
not
a
factor.
and
i
say
that
we
need
that
protection
in
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
the
constitution.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that
if
it
--
if
you
don't
intend
at
all,
it'd
still
be
fiction.
it
wasn't
said
that
the
charge
was
--
is
the
article
fiction?
not
did
the
defendant
create
fiction,
which
might
connote
knowledge
and
the
charge
in
youssoupoff
was
whether
the
television
program
fiction?
was
it
true?
was
it
false?
and
--
and
that
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
is
so.
it
--
it
comes
down
to
the
question
--
and
i
think
the
sutton
versus
hearst,
the
red
rose
case
is
a
good
illustration,
of
--
of
embellishment,
of
exaggeration
a
bit,
where
the
facts
of
which
they
--
where
they
start
are
basically
true
facts
and
that's
what
caused
the
split
in
the
court
there.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
very
violent
split.
and
presiding
justice
peck
and
mr.
justice
shientag
said,
“well,
these
facts
as
we
have
them
are
basically
true
even
though
if
they
have
been
blown
up."
and
that's
all
you're
talking
about
even
in
the
binns
case,
that
original
telegraph
operator
case.
everything
where
several
different
reels
and
the
only
thing
that
was
condemned
was
the
last
one
because
it
had
a
picture
of
them
with
a
title
of
“this
big
american
smile.”
and
they
said,
“well
this
is
--
this
is
going
too
far”,
even
though
the
facts
as
to
what
he'd
done
were
basically
quite
correct.
so
it
is
not
a
truth
or
falsity
test,
it's
an
in-between
type
of
thing
so
that
you
don't
point
in
what
you're
talking
about
really.
now,
even
if
you
--
if
you
say
this
is
truth
or
falsity,
they
still
haven't
got
intent
in
this.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
the
difference
in
some
of
these
cases
comes
down
to
the
individual
judgments
of
the
judges
involved
is
whether
they
like
the
story
or
not,
which
is
precisely
the
type
of
censorship
that
the
first
amendment
is
intended
to
do
away
with.
and
to
try
and
exempt
other
cases
on
any
assumption
other
than
that
is
practically
an
impossibility.
so
that
if
you
are
trying
to
get
some
judgment
to
give
the
editor
of
life
of
what
can
you
publish,
and
you
try
to
make
sense
there,
these
new
york
cases,
you
have
ever
done
tough
job,
even
on
this
new
york
times
illustration
i
gave.
you
come
within
the
precise
language
of
gautier
and
maybe
you're
going
to
say,
“alright,
we'll
take
a
chance
and
do
it.”
but
i
say
we
shouldn't
be
in
that
position,
that
the
decent
journalist
should
be
able
to
have
some
test
they
can
follow
when
they're
deciding
what
to
publish.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
sir,
you
do
not.
your
simple
test
is
whether
it's
true
or
not
and
whether
it's
privileged
or
not.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
if
you
can
prove
it
true
it,
surely,
you
can
publish
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
it
is
not
so
much
in
between.
and
--
and
they
referred
with
the
average
decent
publication.
there's
very
little
error.
and
--
and
once
you
know
that
something
is
true,
you
know
you
can
publish
it.
now,
in
this
feeling
--
field
of
privacy,
i'm
merely
suggesting,
when
it's
non-defamatory,
and
you're
talking
about
a
public
fact,
we
should
have
the
protection
that
the
fellow
who
comes
in
to
sue
us
must
prove
a
falsity
and
knowledge
of
falsity
or
recklessness.
and
that
--
this
is
a
minimum
because
mind
you,
this
article
here,
the
dissent
in
the
appellate
division
form
was
an
informative
presentation
of
legitimate
news,
the
dissent
in
our
court
of
appeals.
it
i
understood,
the
article
is
on
its
face,
an
account
of
newsworthy
information.
certainly,
this
is
something
more
than
having
the
slightest
redeeming
social
importance
that
this
court
has
protected
in
the
average
obscenity
cases.
we're
a
long
way
from
that.
we
are
contributing
something
to
public
discussion.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
think
--
i
think
the
statute
should
be
struck
down,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir,
because
i
--
i
think
it
--
it
should
have
--
in
non-defamatory
language
of
public
events,
you
should
have
a
sine
que
non
just
as
you
had
in
new
york
times
when
dealing
with
defamatory
language
of
public
officials.
you
should
have
a
sine
que
non
of
falsity
plus
knowledge
of
falsity
or
recklessness.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir.
or
as
applied
thus
--
either
way.
but
i
think
the
statute
is
before
you.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
know
of
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
you
have
before
you
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
would
urge
upon
you
strongly
to
strike
it
down
as
being,
on
its
face,
against
and
as
interpreted
directly
against
the
constitution.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
on
its
face,
it's
clear
that
(inaudible)
but
as
construed
by
the
courts
and
that
that
construction
does
not
involve
intent
and
also
at
times
hasn't
--
has
--
has
involved
truthful
statements.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
that
comes
down
as
to
whether
you
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
or
non-negligent
false
statement.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it
may
just
be
plain
wrong
with
no
negligence
whatsoever
and
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
it
isn't
quite
--
it
is
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
it
has
come
down
to
that.
all
i'm
saying
it
--
and
--
and
the
word
“privacy”
is
what
throws
us
all
off
because
this
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
really
isn't
a
privacy
law.
it's
an
intentional
falsehood
maybe
law
with
--
with
neither
of
those
elements.
and
i'm
saying
that
intentional
falsehood
is
not
protected
by
the
constitution.
intentional
falsehood
is
really
what
you're
talking
about
when
you're
talking
about
defamation,
except
that
the
states
have
given
you
a
little
aid
and
make
the
defendant
a
sitting
duck
by
presuming
both
intent
and
falsehood.
now,
you
yanked
out
of
the
presumptions
defamatory
language
dealing
with
public
officials
as
entitled
to
the
protections
that
plaintiff
must
prove
in
this
case.
i'm
saying
that
non-defamatory
language
which
is
the
run
--
one
of
the
middle
language
of
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
the
press,
non-defamatory
language
of
public
facts
deserves
the
same
protection
as
certainly
as
defamatory
language
about
public
officials.
if
you're
going
to
have
free
public
discussion.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
for
a
non-defamatory
language
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
about
public
fact
because
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
but
we're
not
--
that
isn't
involved
here
and
that's
why
i've
been
careful
because
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
because
if
you're
going
to
get
into
the
--
the
private
area,
you
--
you
have
--
have
some
entirely
different
problems.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
you're
dealing
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no.
you're
dealing
with
something
which
was
a
newsworthy
event
two
and
half
years
before
our
articles,
sufficient
so
as
on
the
front
pages
of
every
--
of
every
paper
in
the
country.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
now,
at
that
point,
you're
no
longer
dealing
with
a
private
fact.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
your
test
whether
it's
a
newsworthy
item
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i'm
talking
whether
public
or
private.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
i
say
once
is
public
is
public.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
now,
you're
going
to
have
to
define
as
to
newsworthy
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
for
general
interest.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well
[laughter]
dr.
michael
john
whom
you
know
said
that
the
citizens
have
not
delegated
their
authority
to
decide
for
themselves
what
they
shall
read
and
write.
and
when
you're
talking
about
non-defamatory
language,
that's
precisely
his
point
and
it's
precisely
mine.
but
you
cannot
have
freedom
of
discussion
without
--
of
non-defamatory
language
unless
you
give
the
protection
of
saying
“if
you're
false
and
you
know
you're
false,
my
gosh,
you'll
get
hit.”
but
up
until
that
point,
you
should
be
able
freely
to
discuss
matters.
and
that's
the
very
simple
test
that
--
that
i
propose.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
because
that's
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
not
involved
here.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
alright.
you
going
to
put
a
camera
into
someone's
bedroom
because
you're
going
to
invade
the
home.
you
have
the
intrusion
cases.
you
have
a
multitude
of
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
different
places.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
she
was
right
out
in
the
public
street.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
in
her
store
for
--
for
the
public,
it's
still
public.
now,
that's
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
the
number
of
different
--
of
different
types
of
privacy
problems
is
illustrated
best
by
processing
this,
what
i
said
his
--
these
are
his
false
light
cases
we're
dealing
with
now.
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
saying
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
forget
the
label
privacy
here.
you
can
start
and
to
think
--
correct
yourself
that
if
you
have
non-defamatory
language
about
a
public
event,
again
or
public
fact,
that
you
can
use
that
language
all
you
want
as
long
as
you
don't
falsify
and
intentionally
falsify.
now,
that's
what
you've
said
in
new
york
times.
it
is
applicable
to
defamatory
language
about
public
officials.
and
i
say
the
same
rule
should
apply
to
non-defamatory
language.
that's
--
that's
the
bread
and
butter
of
all
of
these,
no
normal
speech,
no
normal
talking
and
--
and
you
don't
have
the
red
flag
of
defamatory
language.
if
an
editor
has
something
or
is
saying
something
really
bad
about
someone,
he
knows
darn
well,
there's
a
red
flag
there
and
he's
going
to
have
to
prove
its
true
or
he
can't
print
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
sir.
there's
a
--
there's
a
great
area
of
the
law
dealing
with
the
electronic
spying
in
someone's
bedroom,
going
to
someone's
home
and
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
you
would
have
a
--
you
would
have
a
much
tougher
case
if
mr.
hill
instead
of
telling
for
everybody
about
this
incident
and
the
people
coming
in
have
said
nothing,
he
just
sits
in
his
home
knows
--
knows
these
convicts
have
been
in
and
did
nothing.
now,
i
still
think
we
might
have
a
right
if
it's
tied
into
the
play
to
say
something
about.
that's
a
much
more
difficult
case.
if
he
--
if
he'd
done
nothing,
then
no
one
knew
about
it.
but
this
is
a
public
fact.
i'm
not
--
i'm
trying
to
suggest
that
you
restrict
yourself
in
this
case
to
the
false
light
cases
of
dean
prosser
and
to
public
facts
and
to
non-defamatory
discussion
of
public
facts.
you
may
want
to
go
beyond
them
later
on
but
that's
all
this
case
involves.
and
i'm
suggesting
that
with
those
--
with
--
with
that
type
of
a
fact,
the
non-defamatory
discussion
that
we
should
have
both
intent
and
falsity.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
i
started
to
argue
intent
in
my
summation,
mr.
garment
got
up
and
said,
“your
honor,
with
a
great
difference,
i
rise
at
this
point
to
object
to
these
statements.”
so
that
intent,
even
when
i
started
to
argue
it
in
summation,
was
objected
to
by
the
other
side.
a
couple
of
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
judge
said,
“now,
i'll
take
care
of
it,
my
charge.”
and
then
of
course
the
charges
have
came
out
as
i've
already
discussed,
said,
“were
the
statements
in
the
article
are
matter
of
fiction.”
nothing
to
do
with
intent
again.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
started
to
argue
intent
to
the
jury
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
and
was
--
and
i
kept
on
argument
but
i
was
cut
--
but
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
after
starting
the
argument,
objection
by
the
other
side
and
the
judge
said,
“you
are
very
right.
i'll
take
care
of
it,
my
charge.”
the
obvious
inference
from
that
is
that
intent
is
out
of
the
case.
and
indeed,
that's
what
--
what
happened
as
i
--
as
i
detailed
in
my
main
argument
yesterday.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
had
a
specific
request
of
charge
on
intent.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
on
intent.
that's
charge
number
6,
that
i
--
that
i
read
to
the
court
yesterday.
and
i
objected
to
the
failure
to
make
that
charge
except
as
specifically.
first,
on
the
court
of
appeals,
the
blumenthal
case
was
an
affirmance
without
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
redmond
and
franklin
and
gautier
cases
were
all
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
this
--
we
have
more
affirmative
court
of
appeals
than
perhaps
mr.
nixon
indicated.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
--
that's
my
next
point
--
that's
my
next
point,
your
honor.
at
the
time
that
mr.
justice
raiben's
opinion
was
written,
and
at
the
time
when
it
was
specifically
affirmed
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
basis
of
that
opinion,
we
were
saying
that
the
article
was
true.
until
we
reached
this
court,
our
position
throughout
has
been
that
this
was
a
true
article
in
the
broad
sweep
of
it.
so
that
this
was
specifically
an
answer
to
our
contention
that
the
article
was
true.
and
when
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
both
opinions,
what
they
in
effect
were
doing
was
precisely
the
same
thing
they
did
in
the
gautier
case
in
1952
of
referring
back
to
blumenthal
and
saying,
“this
true
item,
we're
not
going
to
allow.”
but
it
was
an
answer
to
our
contention
that
it
was
true,
so
this
was
no
dictum.
moreover,
the
dissent
in
the
appellate
division
by
mr.
justice
botein,
dealt
specifically
with
this
point
of
mr.
justice
raiben's.
and
the
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals
by
mr.
justice
fuld
joined
in
by
mr.
justice
bergan,
again
dealt
specifically
with
that
point,
so
that
i
say
this
was
no
dictum,
this
was
a
direct
holding
in
answer
to
our
contention
that
the
article
was
true.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
when
in
--
when
in
its
--
in
--
it
is
in
answer
to
our
specific
contention
that
the
article
is
true,
it
seems
to
me
is
no
longer
dictum.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
still
think
that
i'm
entitled
to
win
whether
you
--
whether
you
have
that
as
dictum
or
not.
that's
just
one
point
and
one
ground.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
still
have
my
basic
intent
point
in
this
whole
case.
and
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i'm
saying
that
we
have
an
error
in
the
--
in
the
use
of
the
word
“reenacted”.
now,
i
still
say
that
the
article
can
be
interpreted
as
basically
true
in
that
it's
a
story
of
a
family
terrified
by
convicts.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
the
sting
of
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
of
course
not,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
of
course
not,
your
honor.
it
--
it
is
the
question
of
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
it's
a
question
of
which
test
of
truth
you
use
is
--
is
the
difference
between
the
british
and
american
viewpoint
that
i
gave
you
yesterday
as
to
whether
you're
saying
basically
the
net
effect
of
this
is
a
family
terrified
or
not.
i
do
have
to
say
that
we
have
error
in
the
word
“reenacted”
and
that's
why
i'm
in
this
court
on
the
error
and
saying
it's
unintentional
error.
but
i
--
i
come
back
again
on
a
question
of
standing
that
we,
throughout
the
lower
courts,
said
this
article
was
basically
true.
and
if
this
true
crime
in
this
by
this
tenth
play,
i'm
an
eskimo,
it
certainly
did.
and
--
and
that's
the
basic
point.
now,
lastly,
i
just
want
to
thank
you
for
the
courtesy
of
allowing
us
this
reargument
because
i
think
this
case
is
--
is
of
great
importance
in
an
endeavor
to
do
in
privacy
what
you
did
in
libel.
we've
gone
through
this
case
in
11
years.
i've
been
talking
about
the
constitution
throughout
the
new
york
courts.
and
until
we
got
to
this
court,
no
one
realized
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
had
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
and
i
say
it's
time
that
this
court
made
it
quite
clear
to
the
state
courts
that
the
constitution
does
have
something
to
do
with
this.
and
that
when
you
have
non-defamatory
language
about
a
public
fact
that
you
shouldn't
be
held
accountable
unless
you
have
falsity
and
knowledge
of
falsity
or
recklessness.
and
i
state
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there
was
no
such
evidence
in
the
files
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
that
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right
and
of
course
that's
the
point
of
our
reply
brief.
if
you
want
to
go
through
the
record
page
by
page,
as
mr.
justice
black
did
and
said
any
reasonable
person
would
think
that
the
--
that
the
play
was
inspired
by
this
incident,
if
you
go
through
the
record
on
that,
the
papers
in
the
file
upon
which
this
article
was
based
show
no
such
thing.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
sir.
they
are
not,
of
course.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
word
“reenactment”
has
an
ambiguous
frame
of
reference
in
the
article
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
ambiguity
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
have
to
accept
the
ambiguity
being
decided
against
me
in
this
court.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
did
not
in
new
york
courts,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
think
you'll
find
it
in
the
appellate
division
that
the
word
“reenactment”
was
inaccurately
used.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
inaccurately
used
is
what
precludes
me.
when
i
get
to
this
court
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
i
have
to
accept
that
as
a
statement
of
fact.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
if
the
word
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there
is
no
knowingly
false,
that
was
my
last
point,
the
last
argument
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
if
you
assume
that
there
is
falsity
and
that
we
knew
there
was
falsity,
of
course,
we
should
be
held
and
that's
been
my
point
from
the
start.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there's
no
constitutional
protection
for
that.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
test
under
new
york
statute
has
nothing
to
do
with
knowledge
of
falsity.
it
is
a
malice
test
in
terms
of
presuming
intent
to
increase
circulation.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
think
it
should
fit
all
cases
under
first
amendment
and
specifically
non-defamatory
language
we
have
used
about
a
public
fact.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there
is
no
charge
on
intent
or
malice
whatsoever
except
with
the
punitive
damages
whether
we
do
not
knowingly
or
--
or
negligently.
but
so
far
as
liability
or
not,
the
--
the
charge
had
nothing
to
do
with
intent
or
malices.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
--
the
appellate
division
decision
found
specifically
that
we
did
not
know
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it
was
not
tried
in
intentional
intent
whatsoever.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
indeed,
the
whole
record
shows,
there
was
no
intent.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
you're
precluded
by
the
finding
of
fact
of
the
appellate
division
when
it
said
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it
still
was
not
a
question
that
was
--
was
ever
put
to
the
jury.
it
hasn't
been
passed
upon
by
the
jury.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
still
should
win.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
state
of
new
york.
it
involves
a
first
amendment
problem
and
involves
the
privacy
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york.
on
file
originally,
there
was
a
jury
verdict
of
$175,000.
reversed
on
appeal,
was
being
grossly
excessive
and
for
prejudicial
error.
upheld
however,
on
liability
with
the
presiding
justice
botein
dissenting
in
a
--
on
a
written
opinion.
retrial
without
a
jury,
a
$30,000
award
that
went
up
to
--
direct
to
the
court
of
appeals,
affirmed
with
--
dissenting,
they
affirmed
on
the
opinions
of
the
appellate
division
with
dissenting
opinion
by
mr.
--
by
judge
fuld
and
judge
bergan
along
the
same
lines
as
presiding
justice
botein.
there
are
three
factual
elements
that
go
into
this
case.
first,
a
1952
incident
in
which
mr.
hill,
the
appellee
and
his
family
were
held
prisoner
by
three
escaped
convicts.
secondly,
a
book
written
in
1953
by
one
joseph
hayes,
later
converted
by
him
into
a
play
in
a
motion
picture
called
“the
desperate
hours”
which
involved
a
family
held
prisoner
by
three
convicts.
and
lastly,
a
reporting
by
life
magazine
in
february
of
1955
when
the
play
appeared
on
broadway
which
involved
a
prominent
mention
of
the
hill
family
in
connection
with
the
recording
on
that
play.
i
think
i
have
two
main
functions
today.
first,
to
tell
you
about
the
facts
and
probably
more
detailed
than
is
normal
because
the
facts
are
somewhat
complex
but
i
think
once
they'll
understood,
the
conclusion
flows
in
actual
belief
from
those
facts.
and
secondly
to
suggest
one
or
two
propositions
that
may
lead
to
what
i
think
is
a
rather
simple
solution
to
this
case
which
has
been
over
--
overly
complicated.
and
i
start
with
mr.
hill
and
his
family
back
in
september
1952
and
he
and
his
wife
in
their
early
40s,
they
were
an
attractive
couple
and
they
had
two
teenage
daughters,
a
young
son
aged
11
and
a
pair
of
four-year-old
twins.
they
lived
in
the
suburbs
of
philadelphia
and
they
got
up
on
september
19
of
1952
and
they
had
breakfast
and
after
breakfast,
mr.
hill
and
their
daughters
went
off,
they
went
to
school
and
he
to
work
and
mrs.
hill
turned
on
the
radio
and
heard
a
report
that
there
had
been
three
escaped
convicts.
shortly
thereafter
and
precisely
at
8:30
o'clock
in
the
morning,
there
was
a
knock
in
the
door
and
there
was
the
three
escaped
convicts.
two
of
them
was
--
were
brothers,
the
older
one
was
the
spokesman
for
the
three
and
they
entered
the
house.
they
held
the
family
captive.
they
captured
mr.
hill
and
their
daughters
when
they
returned
later
on
the
day.
they
stayed
until
3:30
the
following
morning
when
they
left
in
the
family
car.
the
family
was
unharmed.
those
are
the
essential
elements
of
that
incident.
the
next
afternoon
after
mr.
hill
had
reported
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
not
in
that
moment.
there
was
some
clothing
and
some
caviar
--
cash
your
honor.
i'm
trying
to
stress
the
elements
that
--
that'll
come
into
place
later
when
i
get
to
the
desperate
hours.
the
following
afternoon,
mr.
hill
came
out
in
his
floor
--
front
porch
and
with
a
microphone
held
a
press
conference.
a
picture
of
him
with
that
press
conference
is
exhibit
a
at
page
379
of
the
record.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no
sir.
the
press
was
there
and
he
determined
that
he
would
have
to
say
something
to
them
and
he
did.i
do
think
privacy
wise
it
may
be
of
importance
in
our
case.
at
any
event
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
he
gave
publicly
his
story
to
the
press
on
a
microphone.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
privacy
wise,
the
fact
that
this
is
a
public
fact
maybe
of
some
importance
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
not
a
private
fact.
it
would
be
one
thing
if
mr.
hill
had
said
nothing
perhaps
not
going
to
com
--
to
the
police.
and
then
he
had
published
something
about
the
incident.
but
certainly,
this
fact
was
made
public
first
by
mr.
hills'
own
act
and
he
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
the
press
was
there
and
he
was
there
and
he
went
with
a
microphone
and
gave
a
statement
to
them.
now,
whether
you
call
that
calling
a
press
conference
or
not,
i
don't
know
but
that
was
what
happened.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
the
following
morning,
the
new
york
times
had
a
front
page
story
on
it
and
that's
exhibit
b
and
that's
pages
380
and
381
of
the
record
and
it
runs
over
to
the
second
page.
and
mr.
hill
agreed
that
it
was
substantially
what
he
gave
in
his
press
conference.
now,
that
happens
to
be
of
importance
because
later
on
both
the
author
and
the
life
people
have
this
new
york
time
story
before
them.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i've
(inaudible)
what
is
about
that?
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
he
merely
made
a
statement
to
the
press,
i
think
is
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
all
i
was
suggesting
was
that
that
was
precisely
what
happened.
he
was
urged
by
the
police
officers
there
to
say
something
to
the
press
and
he
testified
that
he
himself
wanted
to
say
something
because
he
wanted
to
make
sure
that
they
all
knew
as
precisely
what
happened
on
there.
that's
the
fact
of
the
matter.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
now,
thereafter,
after
that
incident,
the
hill
family
moved
from
philadelphia
and
went
about
their
ways
and
tried
to
forget
about
them.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes
sir,
they
did.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
in
part
of
it,
they
had
planned
to
leave
before
that
but
they
accelerated
to
move
was
the
testimony
your
honor.
and
move
to
greenwich,
connecticut
that
fall.
now,
the
next
actor
that
comes
in
is
mr.
joseph
hayes.
he
in
april
and
may
of
1953
wrote
"the
desperate
hours."
he
had
the
new
york
times
clipping
before
him.
later
on,
that
novel
which
became
a
bestseller
and
which
was
serialized
in
couriers
which
came
out
with
the
literary
guild
which
would
--
came
out
as
a
paperback
with
the
pocketbooks
and
a
con
--
in
condensed
form
with
reader's
digest
was
turned
into
a
play.
and
the
play
which
is
what
we're
reporting
on
was
identical
with
the
story
which
i
have
just
given
you.
there
was
a
middle
40s,
attractive
couple
living
in
the
suburbs
with
a
teenage
daughter
and
a
10-year-old
son.
and
they
got
up
in
the
morning
and
had
breakfast
and
mr.
hillard
was
the
name
of
the
man
in
the
play
and
the
novel.
mr.
hillard
left
with
his
teenage
daughter
and
mrs.
hillard
turned
on
the
radio
and
heard
a
story
about
three
escaped
convicts.
and
promptly,
at
8:30
in
the
morning,
the
same
as
--
actually
happened
the
same
as
in
the
new
york
times,
three
convicts,
escaped
convicts
arrived,
two
of
them
were
brothers,
the
older
one
acted
as
the
spokesman
for
the
three
of
them.
and
they
entered
the
house
and
thereafter
they
captured
mr.
hillard
and
the
daughter
when
they
returned
and
they
left
thereafter
and
the
family
were
unharmed.
now,
that
was
--
that
is
the
essence
of
the
desperate
hours
leaving
out
the
incidents
which
occurred
in
the
house
when
the
convicts
were
there.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
one
of
--
there
was
--
one
of
the
significant
things
your
honor
is
no
protest
was
made
to
anyone
by
mr.
hill
until
october
1955
with
the
institution
of
this
suit.
there
was
a
lawsuit
commenced
in
october
of
1935
by
mr.
hill
was
joined
as
defendants
(inaudible)
colliers,
for
the
serialization
in
colliers.
the
literary
guild
and
random
house
for
the
book,
the
reader's
digest
for
the
condensation,
pocketbooks
for
the
paperback,
the
desperate
hours
for
the
play
and
paramount
pictures
so
they
all
came
in
eventually.
but
after
the
novel
came
out
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no
sir,
there
was
nothing
whatsoever.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
i'm
about
to
come
up
to
that
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
because
as
soon
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
as
the
book
appeared
and
incidentally
when
the
book
appeared
the
philadelphia
inquirer
reviewed
it
and
said
philadelphia
readers
will
immediately
recognize,
they
sliced
out
of
real
life
of
the
recent
past.
and
incidentally
when
the
play
first
came
out
and
long
before
life
reviewed
it,
the
philadelphia
inquirer
said,
this
is
based
on
a
real
life
incident.
suffice
it
to
say
that
as
soon
as
the
novel
came
out
and
thereafter
with
these
other
publications,
all
of
the
hill's
friends
and
their
--
his
business
acquaintances
came
up
and
say,
“your
story
has
been
written
up
in
a
book.
haven't
you
read
it?”
so,
that
there
was
immediate
identification
by
their
friends
and
acquaintances
and
that's
--
you
would
expect
not
very
bad.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i'm
not
going
to
try
that
in
detail
your
honor
or
(inaudible)
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
it
will
take
too
long,
that
a
period
of
time.
its
covered
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
completely
in
our
briefs.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
but
what
on
the
incidents
in
the
house.
the
same
incidents
did
not
take
place
in
the
novel
as
took
–
its
place
in
the
incident.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no
sir,
i
do
not.
i
think
that's
an
incorrect
characterization.
i
think
a
reading
of
the
play
and
that's
why
it's
difficult
to
put
this
in
an
argument
rather
than
put
in
a
brief
or
read
the
play.
well,
we'll
convince
you
that
there
were
only
four
incidents
which
could
be
called
violence
in
the
play.
mr.
hill
was
struck
twice
but
not
severely
injured.
mr.
hillard
was
struck
twice
but
not
severely
injured.
the
boy
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
he
was
not
struck
at
all.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
but
the
degree
of
violence,
if
--
really
where
it
comes
down
to
is
a
degree
of
terror
because
on
the
terror
end
of
it,
there's
no
doubt
for
what
the
original
incident
was
the
most
terrifying
one
and
was
so
testified
to
by
mrs.
hill.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no
sir.
they
--
their
brief
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
specifically
says
that
the
daughter
was
hurt.
it
was
not
in
the
play
or
the
book.
it's
a
plain
erroneous
statement
of
fact.
there
were
two
incidents
when
one
of
the
convicts
had
in
--
sort
of
incipient
leer
at
the
daughter
and
in
each
instance
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
the
younger
brother
of
the
convicts
politely
cut
him
off
and
he
throughout
addressed
the
daughter
as
miss.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
leer.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
he
started
to
think
according
--
if
you
read
the
part
in
the
play.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
i
think
what
i
coming
down
to
and
what
i'm
trying
to
show
because
the
main
point
i'm
going
to
end
up
with
is
the
substantial
relationship
between
the
two
even
though
you
can't
take
every
incident
on
the
thing.
now
after
these
things
have
happened,
we
entered
the
scene
and
our
editor-in-charge
of
the
entertainment
world,
tom
prideaux.
the
first
he
heard
of
it
is
in
a
chance
conversation
with
robert
montgomery,
the
director
of
the
play.
and
robert
montgomery
told
him
that
it
was
based
upon
an
incident.
shortly
thereafter,
he
saw
a
man
named
bradley
smith,
a
freelance
photographer
and
a
friend
of
joseph
hayes
the
author
and
bradley
smith
said,
there
is
a
substantial
connection
between
the
play
and
a
real
life
incident
in
philadelphia.
later,
he
noticed
that
the
play
was
opening
in
philadelphia.
he
called
hayes,
the
author
in
philadelphia
and
said,
“was
there
an
incident?”
and
hayes
said,
“yes”.
and
there
after
at
prideaux's
request,
hayes
made
arrangements
to
go
out
to
the
house
which
the
hill's
formerly
had
occupied
but
then
they'd
left
so
that
pictures
could
be
taken
in
the
house.
now
based
on
all
of
that,
and
the
fact
that
mr.
prideaux
had
read
the
time's
article,
he
saw
the
play
twice
and
he
said,
“i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
play
was
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
family's
incident.
and
based
on
that,
i
thought
that
what
we
finally
wrote
in
the
article
was
completely
truthful
and
true
and
honest.
i
may
say
also
that
is
as
the
case
in
any
life
with
time
article,
there
is
a
specific
researcher
assigned
to
check
the
matter
and
her
job
is
to
check
the
facts
and
put
a
checkmark
over
every
word
to
show
that
she's
going
back
to
make
sure
of
his
accuracy.”
and
she
was
the
young
lady
named
laura
ecker
at
the
time
of
the
trial
she'd
left
us
and
was
married
named
laura
ludwig.
and
she
testified,
“yes,
i
checked
this
article
and
the
checkmarks
appeared
and
i
was
satisfied
that
it
was
true
and
correct
and
honest.”
now
the
article
itself
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no
sir,
she
did
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact
mr.
prideaux
said,
“the
matter
of
privacy
never
entered
my
mind
because
it
was
a
matter
of
public
record.
it
had
been
in
streaming
headlines.”
and
i
think
this
matter
of
public
record
i'll
be
reverting
to
your
honor
and
it
comes
down
to
this
public
fact
business.
the
article
itself
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
she
read
the
time's
article,
she
saw
the
play.
she
talked
with
prideaux
and
got
prideaux's
version
of
having
talked
with
montgomery,
with
bradley
smith,
and
then
with
the
author.
and
the
fact
that
the
author
had
made
all
the
preparations
for
use
of
this
very
house
which
was
obviously
envisaging
a
connection
between
the
incident
and
the
house
and
said
nothing
more.
prideaux
said,
“i
assumed
after
all
that
that
there
was
a
connection.”
the
article
itself
at
pages
15
and
following
in
the
record
is
headed,
"true
crime
inspires
tense
play,"
and
it
shows
the
hill
house
and
then
goes
on
and
says,
the
ordeal
of
a
family
trapped
by
convicts
gives
broadway
a
new
thriller,
the
desperate
hours.
then
it
goes
to
say
“three
years
ago,
americans
all
over
the
country
read
about
the
desperate
ordeal
of
a
james
hill
family
who
were
held
prisoners
in
their
home
outside
philadelphia
by
three
escaped
convicts.”
later,
they
read
about
it
in
joseph
hayes'
novel,
the
desperate
hours,
inspired
by
that
family's
experience.
now
they
can
see
the
story
reenacted
in
hayes'
broadway
play
based
on
the
book.
the
next
year,
they
were
seen
in
this
movie
which
had
been
filmed
and
which
is
being
held
up.
the
play
directed
by
robert
montgomery
and
expertly
acted
is
a
heart
stopping
account
of
how
a
family
rose
to
heroism
in
a
crisis
then
it
goes
on.
now
that's
the
gist
of
the
article.
after
the
summons
and
complaint
served
in
this
action
originally
named
all
of
these
other
defendants
which
i
have
pointed
out
to
your
honor
and
also
through
three
verified
complaints
said
that
the
play
with
some
fictionalization
was
based
on
the
hill's
story
and
that
the
play
constituted
a
portrayal
of
the
hill
story.
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
author
of
the
play
joseph
hayes
was
examined
before
trial
and
obviously
being
anxious
to
avoid
the
effect
of
those
three
amended
complaints
he
backpedaled
as
far
as
he
could
on
any
connection
between
the
incident
and
the
play
although
he
did
affirm
that
the
title
"true
crime
inspires
tense
play"
was
a
correct
and
true
title.
and
did
state
that
later,
they
read
about
it
in
joseph
hayes
novel,
“the
desperate
hours”
inspired
by
the
family's
experience
was
true
and
correct.
thereafter,
the
present
complaint
was
served
nameling
--
naming
time,
inc.
and
hayes
and
the
desperate
hours
company
as
the
only
remaining
defendants.
but
this
complaint
says,
it
wasn't
a
portrayal
at
all
and
it
wasn't
based
on
an
incident
at
all
and
to
have
said
that
was
at
--
was
completely
false.
we
move
for
summary
judgment
that
was
denied
and
was
affirmed
on
appeal.
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
being
based
on
precisely
the
same
grounds.
i'm
now
putting
forward
--
or
will
be
putting
forward
your
honors.
at
the
trial,
mr.
hill
was
merely
the
sole
witness
for
himself
on
saying
that
he
had
been
distressed
by
this
and
people
would
think
that
he'd
lied
when
he
described
what
had
actually
happened.
hayes
was
cross-examined
a
--
cross-examined
and
he
finally
admitted
on
cross-examination
that
the
matter
had
been
triggered
in
a
very
direct
way.
it
was
brought
out
on
cross-examination
that
in
1954
when
the
novel
came
out,
he
had
written
a
little
advertising
splurge
that
came
out
in
wings,
the
reader's
digest
magazine,
stating
that
the
story
was
based
on
two
incidents,
one,
the
snyder
case
in
new
york
and
the
hill
case.
the
snyder
case
in
new
york
had
no
resemblance.
it
was
merely
one
convict
pulling
a
woman
and
her
young
daughter,
a
prisoner
and
killing
the
daughter
as
the
police
closed
in.
later,
it
was
brought
out
that
in
january
1955
and
this
is
prior
to
the
life
article,
he
had
written
an
article
for
the
new
york
times
entitled,
“fact
out
of
fiction”
and
he
said
it
was
based
then
on
four
incidents.
the
snyder
case,
the
hill
case
and
two
others,
one
in
detroit
that
turned
out
to
be
just
a
man
driving
the
girl
out
on
a
car
and
another
one,
a
california
episode
where
some
convicts
captured
a
car
in
a
dessert,
drove
back
to
a
family's
home
and
then
were
captured
as
they
drove
back
to
town.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
in
this
court,
it
makes
absolutely
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
in
this
court,
we
have
to
assume
falsity.
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
i
was
saying
true.
constitutionally,
in
this
court
we
have
to
assume
that
the
inference
we
drew
was
erroneous.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
quite
true
your
honor
except
that
the
sole
test
that
was
utilized
with
the
jury,
it
was
a
dual
test.
one
was
a
remodel,
to
increase
circulation.
it
was
to
my
mind,
it's
just
crazy
(inaudible)
because
any
publisher
has
a
motive
to
increase
circulation
so
any
jury
is
always
going
to
say
“yes”
to
that.
it
might
just
well
say,
“it
is
your
motive
sitting
on
the
bench
to
earn
money,
you're
obviously
being
paid
for
it
but
your
motive
is
to
do
a
good
job
as
a
judge.”
so
if
the
motive
to
increase
circulation
proves
nothing,
the
other
thing
was
truth
or
falsity.
and
all
i'm
going
to
be
working
up
to
is
that
you
cannot
constitutionally
use
that
as
a
test
in
a
“right
of
privacy”
action.
but
i'll
come
back
to
your
honor's
question
later
in
that
context
if
you
let
me
go
on
with
a
different
story.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
not
as
yet.
i'm
--
all
i'm
trying
to
do
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
we
certainly
have
said
that
you
cannot
constitutionally
hold
us
for
an
error
in
our
publication.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right,
that's
right.
you
cannot
hold
us
either
on
the
specific
application
or
the
statute
in
general
because
i
think
the
statute
in
general
is
too
broad
which
is
now
the
point.
now,
after
getting
back
to
the
stories
again,
i'd
like
to
get
these
facts
straightened
out
because
i
think
they're
of
importance.
after
mr.
hayes
was
finished,
prideaux
and
laura
ecker-ludwig
took
the
stand
just
along
the
lines
i've
previously
indicated
on
their
belief
in
the
truth
of
the
article.
and
then
we
went
to
the
question
of
what
went
to
the
jury
and
i
think
it's
perfectly
evident
that
all
that
went
to
the
jury
was
the
truth
or
falsity
of
our
article.
and
the
theory
which
was
followed
by
the
plaintiff,
it
was
stated
by
mr.
gorman
(ph),
pages
306
and
307
as
follows.
your
honor
if
they
are
telling
news,
if
they
are
telling
news
purporting
to
tell
news
but
have
as
the
basis
for
the
use
of
the
individual's
name
something
that
is
spurious
or
essentially
false.
that
we
contend
is
to
trade
purposes
so
that
his
test
was
one
of
truth
or
falsity.
and
the
courts
stated
the
same
thing
when
he
denied
my
motion
to
dismiss
because
he
said,
page
292,
“i
think
that
it's
a
question
of
fact
as
to
whether
the
life
article
was
true
or
whether
an
inference
could
be
obtained
from
reading
it
that
it
was
not
true.”
and
then
he
went
on
with
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
novel
you
mean?
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
they're
substantially
the
same,
there's
no
doubt
--
there's
no
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know.
they
strictly
speak
in
relevant
because
all
we
referred
to
was
the
play.
the
author
testified
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
author
testified
however
that
the
play
tracked
the
novel
in
substance
with
appropriate
changes
in
the
conversion
process.
the
court
also
charged
in
addition
to
a
general
charge
if
they
found
falsity
that
was
the
end
of
it.
that
we
could
--
we
--
be
held
if
one
of
our
purposes
was
for
the
purposes
of
making
the
article
more
interesting
to
its
readers.
it
does
went
to
the
jury
purely
on
an
--
question
of
truth
or
falsity.
we
took
an
appeal
and
on
the
first
appeal,
there
were
three
opinions,
one
by
mr.
justice
stevens
were
said
in
effect,
this
must
be
for
advertising
purposes
and
to
increase
the
circulation.
in
any
way,
you
should
have
asked
some
more
questions
of
hayes.
that's
a
negligence
theory
on
that.
a
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
rabin,
he
said
it
obviously
was
to
increase
your
circulation
and
that
should
be
the
test.
and
then
a
dissenting
opinion
by
presiding
justice
botein
had
said,
the
sole
test
should
be
whether
the
connection
between
the
two
is
tenuous
or
not
and
if
it
is
not
tenuous
then
clearly
it
was
not
tenuous,
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter
so
far
as
the
court
should
be
concerned.
and
certainly
the
statements
which
were
made
were
not
so
extravagant
that
the
(inaudible)
--
that
the
defendant
should
be
held.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
--
both
concur
--
both
opinions
in
the
appellate
division
were
upheld
and
judge
fuld's
dissent
said
the
same
thing
to
mr.
justice
botein
that
there
was
a
close
and
legitimate
relationship
between
the
two
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there
are
no
differences
--
well,
i
suppose
they
are,
really.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
the
statute
as
construed
has
imposed
liability
of
us
--
upon
us
on
a
falsity
theory
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
let
me
put
it
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
let
me
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
let
me
put
it
this
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
let
me
put
it
this
way.
i
come
to
a
point
i
was
going
to
reserve
for
later.
i
think
the
statute
is
so
broad
that
you
have
the
guessing
game
on
to
it
--
under
it
which
this
court
prohibited
in
winters
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
against
new
york.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
your
honor,
if
a
statute
be
construed
as
presiding
justice
botein
and
judges
fuld
and
bergan
stated
namely,
if
there's
a
legitimate
and
close
relationship
between
the
past
news
event
and
the
present
event,
that's
the
end
of
it.
if
the
statute
be
so
construed,
i
say
that
that's
constitutionally
the
test
that
should
be
followed.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
they
did
not.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
i
am
suggesting
that
constitutionally,
that's
all
they
can
say
and
if
you
go
beyond
that,
if
you
go
to
a
question
of
truth
or
falsity,
at
that
point,
the
constitution
does
not
permit
it.
i
may
say
in
addition
when
mrs.
warren
and
brandeis
first
proposed
this
“right
of
privacy”
in
1890,
they
were
careful
to
observe
obviously
truth
or
falsity
has
nothing
to
do
with
these
matters.
the
american
law
institute
says
in
1867
dealing
with
“right
of
privacy”
states
specifically
in
its
comments
that
truth
or
falsity
has
nothing
to
do
with
this.
and
my
point
on
this
is
that
you
cannot
constitutionally
test
the
matter
of
privacy
on
the
ground
of
truth
or
falsity.
this
--
just
to
test
out
that
way.
last
night's
paper
at
an
article
on
big
fireball
startles
many
in
the
east
and
they
quoted
three
gentlemen,
dr.
thomas
nicholson,
chairman
of
the
hayden
planetarium
and
dr.
fred
l.
whipple,
director
of
the
smithsonian
astrophysical
observatory
and
dr.
c.t.
olivia,
president
of
the
american
meteor
society
all
with
conflicting
statements.
now
let's
suppose
that
as
a
practical
matter
one
of
the
reporters
for
the
evening
story
got
mixed
up
and
none
of
those
gentlemen
made
those
statements
whatsoever
so
that
it
was
completely
false
to
have
stated
that
they
made
those
statements.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
those
three
gentlemen
did
have
relevant
connection
to
a
story
about
a
meteor
and
that
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
matter
privacy
wise.
it
may
be
that
you're
going
to
get
into
libel
and
if
you
get
into
libel,
truth
or
to
--
falsity
is
the
test.
but
i'm
--
getting
the
head
of
my
(inaudible)
--
of
the
game
but
that's
really
what
i'm
(inaudible)
i'm
coming
to.
now,
i
have
really
two
initial
points
and
two
corollaries
problem.
first,
privacy
cannot
constitutionally
exist
for
a
public
fact
which
is
relevantly
connected
with
the
present
news
or
general
interest
event.
secondly,
the
privacy
cannot
constitutionally
exist
for
a
public
fact
period.
now
if
either
relevance
or
the
nature
--
the
public
nature
of
the
fact
be
the
only
two
tests
that
you
have,
you
don't
have
the
guessing
contest
which
was
condemned
in
winters
against
new
york.
and
all
we've
been
doing
in
this
case
for
10
and
a
half
years
frankly
is
guessing
as
to
where
we're
going.
and
i
suggest
however
that
as
between
the
two
tests
constitutionally
in
trying
to
put
aside
--
make
some
solution
to
the
“right
of
privacy”
on
the
one
hand
and
the
first
amendment
on
the
other
hand
that
it's
an
easier
solution
to
use
the
relevance
test
than
to
use
the
public
fact
test
because
with
the
public
fact
test,
you
have
the
constitutional
point
of
can
a
man
put
his
past
in
his
pocket.
can
you
say
that
after
awhile
a
public
event
which
has
been
reported,
he
can
say
to
the
press,
you
can't
touch
it
again?
it's
just
as
if
roy
riegels
on
his
1929
wrong
way
touchdown
which
was
most
embarrassing
to
say,
the
press
can't
mention
that
anymore,
this
is
in
the
past.
now
i
suggest,
this
is
a
slightly
tougher
question
to
decide
constitutionally
on
this
public
fact
although
i
think
it
is
the
correct
constitutional
solution
in
trying
to
harmonize
the
first
amendment
and
“right
of
privacy”.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
right.
all
we're
treating
here
your
honor
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
alright
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there,
i
would
say
--
i
would
say
that
an
entirely
different
tort
might
give
a
cause
of
action
against
that
publication
for
doing
that
but
i
think
the
tort
of
privacy
does
not,
that's
my
simple
point
on
that
because
there's
nothing
private
about
it
by
definition.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
at
that
point,
it
might
be
if
you're
stating
something
false
in
connection
with
this,
what
we're
doing
here,
intentional
falsehood.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
right
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
any
intentional
act
to
cause
harm
which
you
know
is
going
to
cause
harm
gives
a
separate
type
of
cause
of
action.
that's
covered
in
section
873
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
the
restatement.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
say
first,
they
didn't
know
it's
going
to
come
--
cause
harm
and
secondly,
they
had
--
they
didn't
know
there
was
anything
wrong
about
it.
at
the
time
this
article
was
published,
everybody
at
life
plus
the
checker
thought
it
was
entirely
true
and
correct.
and
even
at
the
trial,
prideaux
and
ecker
--
laura
ecker-ludwig
took
the
stand
and
say,
"in
our
judgment
this
article
is
true."
now,
i'm
--
passed
that
point
in
this
court
but
so
far
as
intention,
there
was
nothing
in
any
of
the
opinions
below
to
cast
any
aspersions
in
our
intentions
or
motives
in
this
case.
so
it's
not
a
malice
case.
this
is
a
case
where
you
made
a
mistake.
i
come
to
this
court
saying
that.
alright,
we
made
a
mistake.
and
i
say
the
fact
we
made
out
a
mistake
constitutionally
is
unimportant
when
you're
dealing
with
privacy.
it
comes
down
to
--
if
you
(inaudible)
--
if
you
treat
it
on
a
mistake
basis
and
on
truth
or
falsity,
what's
happened
the
law
of
libel,
you
don't
need
the
law
of
libel
anymore
and
the
safeguards,
it's
much
easier
to
sue
for
a
violation
of
your
“right
of
privacy”
but
all
the
defenses
that
have
been
set
up
in
the
libel
law,
disappeared.
let
me
illustrate
with
an
illustration
here.
here's
a
picture
of
a
golf
player
plays
in
--
out
of
a
trap.
his
face
is
sort
of
shaded.
it
has
the
thing
dirty
player
under
it
and
it
obviously
refers
to
south
africa's
gary
player
but
supposing
there's
been
a
mistake
made
and
this
isn't
mr.
player
at
all,
it's
an
amateur
partner
of
his
in
the
same
tournament.
now
at
that
point,
i
say
since
we're
still
dealing
with
something
relevant
to
that
tournament,
the
fact
you've
make
--
made
a
mistake
is
unimportant
privacy
wise.
if
they
made
a
mistake
libel
wise,
they're
heading
dirty
player
would
obviously
give
that
amateur
player
a
cause
of
action
because
ever
since
the
(inaudible)
jones
case,
there's
not
a
defense
to
a
libel
suit
and
say
he
didn't
know
about
it
but
i'm
suggesting
that
with
respect
to
this
if
there
has
been
an
error
made,
as
long
as
it's
relevant
to
the
tournament
that
you're
entitled
to
do
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
two
and
a
half
years
later
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
your
honor,
we
started
out
with
a
newsworthy
event,
a
play
on
broadway,
a
play
which
has
been
a
novel
of
that
sort,
it's
been
made
to
a
motion
picture.
when
we're
recording
on
that
fact,
if
you
want
to
forget
“right
of
privacy”,
i
say
we
can
report
anything
as
relevant
to
that
and
that
no
one
can
say
snag.
and
the
question
of
interest
or
non-interest,
that's
up
to
us
to
make
it
interesting
or
not
interesting.
that's
the
very
reason
we
have
in
the
first
amendment.
now,
it
so
happens
that
there
is
this
“right
of
privacy”.
whether
you
find
it
in
the
fourth
or
fifth
or
ninth
or
fourteenth,
i
don't
know.
we
recognized
it
and
now
for
it.
i'm
not
disputing
that.
when
the
two
come
together,
boom,
where
do
you
draw
the
line
as
to
when
they
go
(inaudible)
--
as
to
how
far
you're
going
to
go
on
it?
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes
i
do.
that's
0.2
in
our
brief
also.
i
say
it's
much
too
broad.
that's
pro
--
obviously,
mostly
a
matter
of
argument
in
the
briefs
or
haven't
touched
on
it
too
much
but
the
main
fact
--
mere
fact
that
we
have
had
the
guessing
contest
in
this
case
for
ten
and
a
half
years
through
all
these
courts
should
be
a
sufficient
indication
that
it
is
a
guessing
contest.
and
it's
much
too
broad
so
that
we
should
be
able
to
attack
it.
now,
i
still
come
down
to
either
you
have
as
a
solution
to
this
confrontation
of
the
two
rights.
as
a
solution,
the
question
of
is
it
relevant
to
a
present
news
event
and
do
you
know
about
it.
that's
the
solution
that
we've
mainly
suggested
in
our
brief.
it
was
the
solution
suggested
by
mr.
justice
botein
and
judge
fuld
and
judge
bergan
below.
that's
--
follows
along
your
new
york
times
against
sullivan
sort
of
a
--
primary
past
suit.
the
second
point
is,
if
it's
public
fact,
you
never
get
to
that
because
with
the
public
fact
--
well,
as
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
said,
"you
can't
do
anything
because
the
story
of
john
lindgren
is
part
of
the
history
of
our
community.
and
i
say
that
once
it's
part
of
the
history
of
the
community
that
you
can't
take
it
away.
but
again,
that's
a
more
difficult
point.
perhaps
the
type
of
statutes
you
might
have
to
deal
with
is
--
the
defense
law
for
instance
says
that
after
ten
years,
truth
is
no
longer
a
defense
for
libel.
they
in
effect
put
your
past
in
your
pocket
in
ten
years.
of
all
the
cases
that
have
passed
upon
it
in
this
country,
every
single
case
have
said,
you
can
continue
to
publish
with
two
exceptions.
one
was
the
case
of
the
reform
prostitute
on
california,
melvin
against
reid.
another
was
a
similar
criminal
identification
case
in
utah,
mau
against
rio
grande.
but
every
other
case
which
has
passed
upon
in
this
country
has
upheld
the
right
and
i
think
it's
a
constitutional
right
that
once
a
matter
gets
in
the
public
news,
it
stays
there.
now
mind
you
here,
we're
dealing
with
a
very
limited
area
of
the
law
of
privacy.
i'm
not
touching
intrusion
or
appropriation.
we're
dealing
with,
can
you
take
a
past
newsworthy
fact
and
relate
it
to
a
present
newsworthy
fact
even
though
you
slipped
off
and
telling
the
exact
nature
of
that
relationship.
but
if
the
relationship
be
not
tenuous,
i
say
that
we're
entitled
to
do
that,
(a)
because
it's
relevant
and
(b)
because
we
didn't
know
there's
anything
wrong
with
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
question
of
tenuous
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
of
relationship
your
honor
was
never
put
to
that
jury.
i
request
the
charge
on
that.
i
summed
up
on
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that
was
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
majority
opinions
of
the
appellate
division
didn't
think
that
this
non-tenuous
relationship
was
sufficient
as
the
defense.
indeed,
mr.
justice
rabin
in
one
concurring
opinion
said,
“quite
surely
they
could
have
mentioned
the
hill
family
if
they'd
wish
to
but
not
in
the
way
they
did."
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
now,
if
we
could
have
said
the
two
stories
are
strikingly
similar,
at
that
point,
if
you
can
mention
them,
privacy
goes
out
the
window.
from
then
on,
you're
testing
it
by
libel
and
not
by
privacy.
and
that's
the
reason
i
say
once
it's
relevant
you
can
mention
it
of
course.
and
the
way
in
which
you
mention
it
is
your
business
except
that
if
you're
defamatory,
you're
going
to
be
held
for
libel
but
don't
take
the
defenses
of
libel
away
by
the
backdoor
of
this
“right
of
privacy”
cause
of
action.
and
that's
in
essence
what's
been
happening.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it
says,
"for
trade
or
advertising
purposes."
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
i
say
the
new
york
courts
have
done
three
things
which
are
unconstitutional.
first,
they've
said
that
there
can
be
privacy
for
a
public
fact
and
this
was
a
public
fact.
secondly,
they
said
that
the
test
is
truth
or
falsity
and
i
say
that
has
no
relationship
to
privacy.
and
thirdly,
they've
said
that
the
test
must
be
motivation
to
increase
circulation
and
i
say
that
it
cannot
constitutionally
be
the
test
as
to
whether
we're
going
to
be
held
for
having
done
something
wrong
to
somebody.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
the
financing
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
primarily
it
came
from
(voice
overlap)
from
life.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
but
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
but
any
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
line
up
or
report
of
any
play
indeed
of
any
article
in
a
major
magazine
has
countrywide
circulation
always
has
the
indirect
effect
of
helping
promote
that
specific
or
novel
or
idea,
whatever
it
is
you're
talking
about.
but
that
certainly
cannot
be
the
test
as
an
advertising
news,
that's
an
incidental
promotional
test.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
i
say
if
new
york
has
said
that,
then
it
is
going
right
smack
dab
up
against
the
first
amendment.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
that
at
this
point,
we
are
entitled
if
that's
what
new
york
says,
the
statute
says,
we're
entitled
to
come
to
this
court
and
say,
"call
a
hold
to
it."
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
i
thought
i
had
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that
--
no
sir.
that
is
what
i'm
not
sure
of
and
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
but
that
isn't
the
point
presented
by
this
case
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
to
be
frank.i
think
eventually
you
may
get
to
it
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
and
one
of
my
reasons
for
pointing
out
of
this
--
in
our
case
is
that
you've
got
large
areas
such
as
that
still
opened
as
to
what
the
facts
are.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
let
me
give
you
the
test
that
i've
used
for
25
years
with
time
(inaudible).
i've
said
number
one,
you
have
no
right
to
use
anybody's
name
or
picture.
number
two,
you
can
do
it
if
there's
a
reason
for
it.
and
all
i'm
trying
to
do
is
articulate,
its
been
--
to
what
the
reason
is.
now
if
the
reason
--
if
you
have
a
reason
for
it,
i
think
you
can
do
it.
if
you
haven't
got
a
reason,
you
can't
do
it.
our
reason
for
the
hill
case
is
we're
reporting
on
the
play.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
i
think
constitutionally,
you
have
to
have
some
sort
of
a
reason
for
it.
at
least
that
is
what
we
have
been
following
down.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
think
at
that
point
it
could
well
be
but
i
still
would
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
see
that
the
reason
for
doing
it
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
you
have
that
type
of
case
as
to
--
if
you
follow
the
fellow
at
work
and
you
follow
him
down
the
street
and
it's
a
public
place
and
so
far
so
good.
and
then
he
goes
into
his
home
and
that's
the
end
of
it
right
there.
i
think
we
are
in
accord.
when
you
get
into
the
home,
then
you
have
an
intrusion
aspect
which
comes
--
the
different
end
of
things.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
you
know
this
matter
of
news,
general
interest
is
as
much
news
and
doesn't
have
to
be
that
this
happened
today
in
an
--
that
new
sense.
so
it's
a
general
interest
event
that
we're
talking
about
really.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
not
so
far
as
privacy
once
it's
come
out
into
the
public
at
that
point.
now
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
the
newspaper
doesn't
make
the
news.
the
news
is
reported
in
the
newspaper.
when
you've
got
the
cart
before
the
horse
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
lot
of
journalism
schools
teach?
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
this
is
why
i
tried
to
point
out
the
question
with
which
you're
presenting
is
a
very
narrow
one,
on
a
public
fact
related
to
a
public
thing.
if
you
really
want
to
have
all
the
various
facets
of
privacy,
you
have
the
intrusion
cases
right
off
the
bat.you
have
in
the
appropriation
cases.
you
put
a
young
lady
and
put
her
on
a
bag
of
flowers,
they
did
in
the
robertson
case,
obviously
there's
no
relevance
and
you
know
what's
you're
doing,
you
should
be
held
under
statute.
but
if
you
want
to
try
and
saw
in
this
one
case
every
privacy
problem
that
exist,
we
can
be
talking
about
this
for
a
week
because
there
are
multitude
of
them.
and
all
i'm
really
saying
is
that
with
this
specific
problem
on
past
news
related
to
present
news
that
relevance
is
the
test.
and
if
it
were
not
for
privacy
on
your
constitutional
question
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
it
were
not
for
privacy,
obviously
you
could
go
ahead
and
do
that
and
then
it's
a
question
of
finding
the
same
balance
that
your
honors
found
in
new
york
timesagainst
sullivan
as
to
where
the
balance
comes
between
these
two
opposing
forces.
and
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
balance
must
depend
on
this
case
on
relevance
plus
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
we
accept
that
your
honor.
we
don't
challenge
that
at
all.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
say
the
standard
at
least
in
a
case
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well
--
but
all
i
can
say
your
honor
is
the
standard
at
least
in
a
case
when
you're
dealing
with
an
event
of
present
interest
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
you're
going
to
relate
something
in
the
past
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that
is
the
play
or
broadway
opening
that
certainly
is
of
general
news
interest.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
you're
going
to
relate
to
that
past
news
worthy
facts.
i
say
that
you
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it's
been
in
the
news.
it's
a
public
event
so
that
privacy
no
longer
exists
for
that.
i'd
say
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
in
that
situation,
we
--
the
only
test
is
relevance
and
not
truth
or
falsity
so
that
the
fact
that
we
may
have
without
knowing
it,
misstated
the
nature
of
the
relationship
is
constitutionally
immaterial
i
was
saying.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
certainly,
the
past
event
was
so
similar
to
the
present
play
that
in
talking
about
the
play,
it
was
relevant
to
consider
as
to
whether
this
past
have
had
anything
to
do
with
it.
certainly,
we
could
have
said
they're
strikingly
similar
and
at
that
point,
the
privacy
would've
disappeared
and
that
no
one
would
contend
that
there
was
any
cause
of
action
against
this.
and
i'm
saying
the
difference
between
saying
strikingly
similar
and
inspired
is
so
or
reenacted,
it's
so
small
that
we
shouldn't
be
charged
$30,000
for
it
and
we
shouldn't
be
worrying
about
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
alright.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
say,
you
start
off,
once
they
are
relevant,
you
never
get
to
the
question
of
intent.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
if
they're
relevant
that's
--
i'm
trying
to
get
to
that.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
now
i'm
suggesting
that
either
relevance
or
a
past
public
fact,
either
one
is
a
defense.
i
think
it's
a
more
difficult
constitutional
question
as
this
past
public
fact
because
of
the
reformed
prostitute
type
of
case
as
to
whether
you
should
be
able
to
do
that.
but
i'm
perfectly
clear
that
if
there's
relevance
and
that's
precisely
what
was
said
by
the
dissenting
opinions
of
the
two
courts
below
if
there's
relevance
and
the
connection
is
not
tenuous
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
you
never
get
to
the
question
of
knowledge.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
because
otherwise
for
--
if
--
mind
you,
this
is
a
non-defamatory
article.
they
said
the
families
were
heroes.
on
every
item
that
you
publish
or
you
can
check
any
front
page
of
any
paper
on
the
interior
pages.
if
you're
going
to
have
a
test
of
beyond
relevance
to
go
into
--
shall
we
interrogate
as
to
knowledge,
my
goodness,
with
every
--
perfectly
innocuous
news
item
that
appears
in
the
papers,
you're
going
to
have
to
have
a
dual
test
of
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
you
still
have
an
entirely
independent
tort
of
intentional
falsehood
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
here
so
that
if
someone
intentionally
says
something
false
and
goes
out
to
damage
someone,
you're
liable
for
those
special
damages.
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
intentional
falsehood
or
libel
are
going
to
be
in
anyway
hampered
by
what
you
rule
in
this
case.
those
are
independent
remedies.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
to
bring
it
under
a
privacy
remedy
begs
the
question
that
gives
a
false
test
and
i
still
come
down
to
tom
prideaux
who
said,
the
question
of
privacy
never
crossed
my
mind
because
it
was
a
matter
of
public
record.
he
used
that
test
and
i
think
he
was
correct
in
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
said
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
now,
you're
creating
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
you're
trying
to
test
a
value
of
judgment
as
to
the
content
of
the
news
which
is
the
very
reason
why
the
first
amendment
was
set
up
since
you
couldn't.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
all
i
can
say
is
that
that
was
precisely
what
i
say
that
they
can't
make
it
a
tort.
but
it
is
not
made
a
tort
because
of
the
matter
of
presentation.
if
it
is,
you
are
right
on
first
amendment
grounds
because
you're
passing
a
value
of
judgment
as
to
what
we've
done
to
make
the
article
interesting.
and
we're
entitled
to
make
it
interesting
in
our
way
as
long
as
we
don't
trespass
rights.
thank
you.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
can
i
say
one
more
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question.
the
word
intentional
should
be
omitted.
it's
falsehood
for
profit.
there
was
no
proof
of
intentional
here.
it
was
never
given
to
the
jury
is
what
i
requested.
so
if
the
statute
has
been
construed
on
falsehood
to
increase
circulation,
period.
and
i
say
those
two
tests
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
should
not
be
used.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it
was
not
given
to
the
jury
in
this
case.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes
it
is
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
start
this
term
where
we
left
off
last
term
with
mr.
justice
white's
question
concerning
an
intentional
falsehood.
i
think
your
questions
are
directed
to
that
and
our
simple
position
is
that
new
york
has
not
created
a
cause
of
action
for
intentional
falsehood
and
that
the
omission
of
intent
and
falsity
is
fatal.
and
we
start
with
a
standard
that
non-defamatory
language
about
a
public
fact
which
we
have
here
is
protected
by
the
constitution
unless
there
is
both
falsity
and
knowledge
of
falsity.
let
me
turn
to
the
new
york
cases
attempting
to
discuss
them
in
the
order
that
the
court's
questions
were
put
to
us,
first,
in
the
question
of
truth.
the
new
york
courts
have
enjoined
truthful
and
newsworthy
accounts
without
intent.
and
i
turn
to
the
case
of
mrs.
blumenthal
and
this
case
went
to
our
court
of
appeals
and
mrs.
blumenthal
in
the
early
1930s
was
selling
bread
on
orchard
street.
she
was
pictured
in
a
travel
log
for
approximately
six
seconds
out
of
a
17-minute
travel
log.
the
court
enjoined
that
presentation.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
the
appellee's
brief
said
there
are
ethnic
comments
and
gags
and
derisive
commentary.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
let
me
read
what
two
of
the
justices
of
the
appellate
division,
mr.
justice
o'malley
and
mr.
justice
finch
who
viewed
the
picture
said
took
place.
it
is
further
shown
that
no
time
displaying
this
picture
appear
alone
but
on
the
contrary,
the
pictures
of
other
individuals
appear
on
the
side,
in
front
or
in
back
of
her.
in
no
part
of
the
picture
either
by
sound,
title,
subtitle
or
otherwise
is
any
reference
what
so
--
whatever
made
to
her
or
any
of
her
actions
or
emotions.
and
nothing
whatever
is
reproduced
to
emphasize
her
likeness,
occupation
or
actions
other
than
the
usual
silent
reproduction
of
life
and
events
in
that
particular
quarter
of
the
city.
it
is
further
shown
that
at
no
time
in
the
picture
is
plaintiff
depicted
in
a
foolish,
unnatural
or
undignified
manner.
there
is
no
tendency
to
hold
here
up
to
public
ridicule
or
contempt.
there
is
no
distortion
or
exaggeration
of
a
natural
and
normal
physical
conditions
which
obtained
or
of
the
events
portrayed.
the
parties
posing
as
guides
and
school
teachers
engaged
in
a
dialogue
which
consist
largely
a
million
ounce
in
the
places,
buildings
etcetera
in
the
sections
through
which
they
pass
but
there
is
no
statement
or
announcement
in
the
dialogue,
billing
or
otherwise
referring
in
any
manner
to
the
picture
of
the
plaintiff.
so
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
but
these
were
two
members
of
the
court.
the
court
viewed
the
picture,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
this
is
the
description
by
the
two
dissenting
members
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
as
to
what
they
saw.
the
--
i
think
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
that
the
comments
and
complaint
in
appellee's
brief
were
taken
from
the
complaint
which
were
rebutted
by
an
actual
scene
of
the
picture.
now,
if
any
further
--
in
anything
further
on
that,
you
can
turn
to
the
comment
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
1952
in
the
gautier
case
concerning
mrs.
blumenthal
and
her
selling
bread
in
--
bread
on
orchard
street.
and
there,
the
court
said,
“the
blumenthal
case
supra
illustrates
the
area
of
privacy
which
may
not
be
invaded
even
in
this
modern
era
of
television,
when
travelling
upon
the
public
highway
may
expect
to
be
televised
but
only
as
an
incidental
part
of
the
general
scene,
so
when
attending
a
public
event,
such
as
a
professional
football
game,
they
expect
to
be
televised
in
the
status
in
which
he
attends.
if
a
mere
spectator,
he
may
be
taken
as
part
of
the
general
audience
but
may
not
be
picked
out
of
the
crowd
alone,
thrust
upon
the
screen
and
unduly
featured
for
public
view.”
now,
let
me
illustrate
what
i
think
that
means.
it's
the
new
york
times,
a
couple
of
sundays
ago,
this
one
picture
here
of
a
race
riot
in
san
francisco.
there's
another
picture
down
here
of
a
soldier
in
vietnam.
those
two
pictures
are
as,
to
use
the
language
of
gautier,
may
not
be
picked
out
of
a
crowd
alone,
thrust
upon
the
screen
and
unduly
featured
for
a
public
view.
so
strictly
under
the
language,
covering
mrs.
blumenthal's
case,
as
going
again
in
the
gautier
case
in
1952,
these
two
pictures
are
subject
to
the
same
injunction
which
issued
in
the
blumenthal
case
and
the
person
publishing
them
is
--
is
subject
to
a
crime.
and
as
what
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
it
may
well
be
that
they
will
take
their
chance
on
that
but
as
of
the
present,
on
a
strict
reading
of
their
case,
that's
precisely
what
it
means.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
a
travel
log
of
new
york
city
which
took
up
17
minutes,
showing
scenes
throughout
the
city,
happened
to
have
had
her
in
one
scene
for
six
seconds.
if
that
suffice,
so
the
court
issued
an
injunction.
now,
it's
a
current
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it's
a
--
the
word
“newsworthy”,
your
honor
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
it's
not
only
current
news.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
don't
know
when
this
picture
of
the
soldier
in
vietnam
was
taken.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there
are
different
degrees
of
newsworthiness,
your
honor,
a
matter
of
general
interest
comes
within
the
normal
term
“newsworthy”.
if
you're
going
to
limit
that
term
solely
to
current
news
events,
that's
one
thing.
i
do
not
think
that
the
term
can
be
so
limited.
certainly,
a
matter
of
general
interest,
such
as
what
goes
on
in
new
york,
should
be
covered
by
the
constitution,
a
non-defamatory
language.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
the
question
you
put
last
time,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
may
first
say
that
i
think
it's
extremely
unlikely
that
any
picture
which
resulted
will
be
such
that
it
will
be
of
enough
interest
so
that
you'd
show
it.
secondly,
i
do
think
that
you
do
have
your
limited
that
you
cannot,
by
lawful
means,
do
harm
to
someone,
go
and
repeatedly
taking
pictures
of
him
right
and
left.
and
it
maybe
that
it'll
get
up
to
the
disinterested
malevolence
of
mr.
justice
holmes
in
actually
using
lawful
means
to
so
harass
someone
that
they
are
harassed.
but
absent
that,
if
you
want
to
take
a
series
of
picture
of
someone
in
a
public
street
on
a
public
fact,
and
--
and
put
that
on
the
screen,
i
think
you're
entitled
to
absent
intentional
falsehood.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
think
you
might
reach
the
point
where
you
have
that
disinterested
malevolence
that
you're
intentionally
trying
to
do
harm
to
here
even
though
by
legal
means
so
that
you'd
have
another
tort
created,
the
same
tort
that
mr.
justice
holmes
referred
to
in
the
atlanta
bank
--
bank
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
case,
256
u.s.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
thought
that
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
will
call,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
i
didn't
say
the
statute.
that's
the
entirely
different
tort,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
do
not
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
say
that
this
will
bring
the
statute
into
play.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
tort
would
be
a
prima
facie
tort
of
intentional
infliction
of
a
harm,
and
you
know
that
you're
doing
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
entirely
a
separate
tort.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it's
the
right
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
atlanta
bank
case
in
256
u.s.
350,
358.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
anyone
who
uses
lawful
means
with
the
sole
intent
of
harming
someone
else
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
then
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
we're
dealing
with
a
private
fact,
i
was
careful
to
state
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
the
none
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
or
not
on
this
question
of
trade
or
advertising.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
the
present
statute
is
so
broad
that
it
literally
covers
anything
on
--
on
the
trade.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
but
i
would
certainly
would
not.
and
i
--
and
i
think
the
normal
privacy
case
outside
of
this
statute,
your
honor,
stops
going
into
a
person's
home,
well,
you
have
a
non-public
fact
then
and
that's
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
why
i
said
non-defamatory
language
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
as
to
a
public
fact
is
entitled
to
constitutional
protections.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
would
think
he
would
be
entitled
constitutional
protection.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
think
there
is
a
constitutional
prohibition
against
that,
your
honor,
going
to
someone's
home.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it
depends
whether
the
public
is
allowed
in
the
office,
if
the
public
is
allowed
then
it's
fine.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
certainly,
when
you
get
to
the
--
our
reception
room,
yes.
when
you
get
to
the
--
the
next
office
back,
i
have
a
more
difficult
problem
as
to
whether
that's
part
of
the
public
or
you're
private
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
but
then
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
as
to
you
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
i
think
what
we've
come
down
to
here
that
this
phrase
“privacy”
is
a
misnomer
because
we're
really
talking
about
intentional
falsehood
rather
than
privacy
even
though
the
statute
has
that
label
and
investigating
as
to
whether
which
it
could
view
constitutionally,
whether
you
created
a
cause
of
action
for
intentional
falsehood
under
the
guise
of
this
statute
because
i'm
limiting
to
myself
to
public
facts,
the
facts
we
have
here
as
the
hill
family
was
a
public
fact
as
opposed
to
a
private
fact.
and
all
i'm
saying
here
is
that
when
you
have
non-defamatory
language
about
a
public
fact
that
is
constitutionally
protected
unless
and
until
you
have
both
falsity
and
knowledge
of
falsity.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
but
obviously,
the
original
enactment
was
passed
in
order
to
prevent
you
from
publishing
a
young
lady's
photograph
and
a
bag
of
flower
but
then
was
expanded
beyond
that.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
don't.
i
do
not
think
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
let
--
let
me
put
this
way.
if
you
have
non-defamatory
language
about
a
--
a
public
fact,
that's
the
typical
free
speech,
free
press
language
you're
talking
about
as
opposed
to
defamatory
language.
now,
at
that
point,
absent
falsity
and
intentional
falsity,
i
say
it's
protected
because
both
of
your
libel
and
privacy
in
a
way
come
under
the
thing,
the
constitution
does
not
protect
intentional
falsity.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
but
a
public
fact,
your
honor
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i'm
saying
the
language
concerning
this
public
fact
even
though
you
may
erroneously
report
--
report
it,
if
it's
non-defamatory,
must
be
tested
both
by
falsity
and
by
knowledge
of
falsity.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i'm
saying
that
if
you're
talking
about
negligent
falsity
at
that
point,
that's
when
the
constitution
interposes
because
public
discuss
--
discussion
of
non-defamatory
nature
is
a
sufficient
importance
so
that
you
should
not
impose
a
check
on
this
unless
there
is
both
falsity
and
intent.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
i
include
recklessness
with
--
with
intentional
falsity
of
course.
well,
that
--
that
goes
without
saying
it.
so
--
so
that
--
that
is
the
standard
that
i'm
--
i'm
supposing
here
that
was
being
followed.
that
was
the
new
york.
of
course
first,
we
start
with
something
true
as
with
mrs.
blumenthal
which
has
been
enjoined.
the
very
test
of
fictionalization
is
not
one
of
truth
or
falseness
--
falsity.
it's
embellishment
or
exaggeration,
so
that
you
will
have
articles
which
are
basically
true
but
which
involve
elements
of
--
of
embellishment
which
have
been
prohibited
or
--
or
to
our
ability,
found.
the
sutton
against
hearst
case,
which
we
have
in
our
brief,
the
red
rose
case
--
the
red
rose.
there,
the
majority
found
there
was
fictionalization
but
the
dissenting
opinion
by
then
presiding
justice
peck
and
mr.
justice
shientag
said,
“well,
on
the
facts
before
us,
the
article
is
basically
true
even
though
there
is
embellishment.”
so
that
i
that
suggest
to
you
that
with
the
fictionalization
cases
by
themselves,
it
is
not
a
test
of
truth
or
falsity.
and
even
the
binns
case
again
which
started
this
fictionalization,
at
the
end
of
the
case,
they
had
a
very
significant
little
passage.
it
is
urged
that
there
is
danger
of
serious
trouble
in
the
practical
enforcement
of
any
rule
which
maybe
adopted
in
construing
and
enforcing
the
statue
so
far
as
it
relates
to
purposes
of
trade.
if
there
is
any
basis
for
the
suggestion
of
danger
enforced
in
a
part
of
the
statute
or
consideration,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
legislature
to
repeal
such
part
thereof
or
so
modify
it
as
to
define
with
a
greater
particularity
what
it
intends
should
be
prohibited.
but
the
statute
was
never
amended
despite
that
suggestion
by
the
court.
i
may
say
in
that
regard
that
just
as
this
court
in
the
new
york
time
case
used
coleman
against
maclennan
in
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
as
a
guide
to
the
common
law
that
i
would
suggest
that
a
similar
use
maybe
made
of
donahue
against
warner
brothers
in
the
supreme
court
of
utah.
that
case
construed
a
new
--
a
utah
statute
practically
identical
with
the
new
york
statute
here.
and
for
the
very
reasons
which
i
have
been
putting
forward
to
this
court,
found
that
it
have
to
be
construed
to
mean
use
of
a
name
or
picture
solely
in
connection
with
--
with
the
sale
of
a
commodity
because
otherwise,
they
found
the
same
constitutional
difficulties
which
i
am
urging
upon
you
here.
so,
i
suggest
that
that
donahue
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
can
be
used
as
the
model
much
as
you
did
with
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
in
the
new
york
times.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that
was
decided
in
1954
and
they
ended
up
by
saying,
“the
twilight
areas
of
uncertainty
between
the
alternative
as
such
that
a
publisher
would
have
to
be
constantly
negotiating
a
hazardous
course
between
educational
and
none
educational,
fact
and
fiction,
public
and
private
character
from
one
quandary
to
another
so
that
the
situation
would
be
both
impracticable
and
intolerable
and
go
right
along
the
same
constitutional
theory
that
i'm
following
here.
so
i
--
i
merely
suggest
that
that's
a
possible
--
be
of
possible
utility
to
the
court
on
--
on
this
question.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it's
cited
in
the
brief,
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
donahue
and
it's
in
the
reply
brief,
yes.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir.
now,
on
the
question
of
standing
on
this
matter
of
truth,
i
say
that
we
have
standing
for
two
reasons.
first,
we
have,
up
to
the
time
we
got
to
this
court
throughout
all
the
new
york
courts
stated
that
the
life
article
was
true,
in
the
broader
sense
of
the
word
“truth”.
surely
that
there
was
the
ambiguous
inaccuracy
on
the
word
“enactment
--
reenactment”.
but
aside
from
that,
the
fact
that
the
play
was
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
hill
incident
as
testified
to
at
the
trial
and
the
fact
that
it
basically
--
merely
was
a
--
a
picture
of
a
family
being
terrorized
by
three
convicts.
we
made
the
point
throughout
that
the
article
was
basically
true.
i
think
myself
that
is
the
reason
why
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
both
opinions
below
including
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
raiben
which
said
that
even
if
--
if
it's
true,
you
still
going
to
be
libel.
it
was
an
answer
to
that
contention
of
ours.
so
that
i
say
that
on
that
broader
test
of
truth
having
put
that
forward
throughout
the
courts
below,
we
have
standing
to
raise
this
question
of
--
of
truth.
i
may
say
that
on
this
broader
question
of
truth,
this
question
of
standard
to
illustrate,
people
say
that
the
british
and
the
american
libel
law
are
the
same
and
that
each
has
a
defense
of
truth.
that's
true
when
you
ask
completely
false
in
a
way.
i
--
if
i
should
write
that
johnny
jones
stole
a
watch
last
tuesday
and
i
come
in
the
court
and
prove
that
johnny
jones
stole
a
clock
last
tuesday,
that's
a
defense
under
our
law,
it
is
not
a
defense
under
british
law.
or
if
i
find
that
johnny
jones
--
truth
of
johnny
jones
stole
a
watch
last
wednesday
instead
of
tuesday,
it
is
not
a
defense
under
british
law.
and
you
can
refer
to
gatley
section
257
in
that
regard.
so,
it
depends
whether
you're
using
the
narrower
test
of
truth
or
a
broader
test
of
truth
in
applying
these
standards.
in
any
event,
we
did
raise
that
and
it
seems
to
me,
it
does
give
us
standing
to
raise
the
point
of
truth.
secondly,
under
button
and
dombrowski,
in
this
court,
when
you
have
a
statute
which
has
been
applied
to
enjoin,
as
in
mrs.
blumenthal,
a
truthful
account
and
in
other
cases
which
we
cited
in
our
--
in
our
brief.
when
you
have
this
statute,
it
does
have
an
inhibitory
effect.
and
i
say
that
at
that
point,
this
court
should
raise
the
point
and
go
into
it.
i
ensure
that
ever
since
the
youssoupoff
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
which
i
will
go
into
in
a
minute,
the
c.b.s.
has
been
more
than
careful
in
trying
to
hold
back
in
some
other
things
it
has
done.
it's
impossible
to
affect
to
--
really
to
appraise
the
effect
of
the
decisions
but
we
do
know
that
they
do
take
place
and
the
smaller
publishers
just
can't
afford
to
be
coming
up
to
this
court.
in
this
case
alone,
this
is
the
fifth
appeal
we've
argued
and
two
trials
and
we've
been
at
it
for
11
years.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
record
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
willfully
--
well,
all
i'm
saying
is
you
--
you
need
both
falsity
and
intent
if
you
have
non-defamatory
language
because
intentional
falsity
has
no
constitutional
protection
and
shouldn't
have
and
the
law
of
libel
is
part
of
that
except
that
you
allow
the
states
to
presume
both
intent
and
falsity
except
when
you're
dealing
with
a
public
official,
when
you
yank
that
presumption
back
and
say,
"go
back
and
prove
intent
and
prove
--
and
prove
falsity
because
it's
important
when
you're
talking
about
public
officials.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
do
not,
no.
except
that
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
you
may
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
if
the
libel
is
concerning
public
officials
and
perhaps,
you'll
extend
it
to
public
figures
and
public
issues
that
is
--
other
--
be
coming
up
in
other
cases
of
course
but
--
but
you
still
come
back
to
intentional
falsehood.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
all
i'm
saying
is
you
have
to
prove
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
might
be
--
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that's
so
and
moreover
which
the
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
it's
probably
a
question
for
the
jury
as
to
wherever
it's
reckless
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
if
the
jury
found
falsity
and
based
on
the
facts
you've
stated
found
reckless
indifference
to
whether
it
was
false
or
not,
i
think
that
verdict
would
be
upheld
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir,
of
course.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
question
of
intent,
first,
on
the
cases
other
than
our
case
and
secondly
to
our
case.
i
think
it
is
clear
beyond
the
--
from
a
venture
of
a
doubt
that
this
question
of
intent
or
knowledge
of
falsity
or
even
malice
or
certainly
knowledge
of
falsity
is
utterly
falling
to
this
question
of
privacy
as
interpreted
by
the
new
york
courts.
and
the
clearest
example
i
can
give
you
is
the
thompson
against
close-up
case,
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
where
a
magazine
used
a
wrong
picture
and
a
summary
disposition
of
the
case
was
denied
because,
said
the
court,
“it
may
be
found
that
the
publication
although,
perhaps,
by
mistake,
was
--
was
published
in
order
to
increase
circulation.”
so
that,
the
intent
end
of
it
was
totally
thrown
out.
the
youssoupoff
decisions
and
case
where
the
admitted
assassin
of
rasputin
coming
into
court
and
saying,
“you
didn't
tell
it
correctly.”
intent
was
following
to
that
case
throughout.
it
reached
the
point
initially
whether
it's
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
by
the
plaintiff
which
was
almost
granted.
two
concurring
judges
in
our
appellant
division
said,
“he
should've
gotten
it
because
there
was
embellishment,”
but
no
discussion
of
intent
whatsoever.
it
went
back
to
trial.
and
we
found
in
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
county
trying
as
to
whether
the
admitted
assassin
of
rasputin
and
to
have
his
--
have
the
story
correctly
told
and
the
matter
was
put
to
a
jury
are
the
test
of
charge
for
the
juries,
in
appendix
to
my
brief,
no
question
of
intent
raised
throughout.
and
the
only
question
given
to
the
jury
was
truth
or
falsity.
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
the
judge
--
trial
judge
specifically
said,
"malice
is
not
a
part
of
this."
so
that
i
say
it
clearly
appears
from
the
youssoupoff
case
and
those
decisions
that
intent
is
--
is
not
a
necessary
element,
no
scienter
under
this
new
york
statute.
the
most
recent
decision
of
that
is
the
spahn
case
by
our
appellate
division
in
1965
and
at
the
end
of
that,
it
said,
"if
the
publication,
however,
by
intention
per
report
or
so
format,
is
neither
factual
nor
historical,
the
statute
applies.
and
if
the
subject
is
11
person,
his
written
consent
must
be
obtained.”
so
that
it's
clear
from
other
cases
that
intent
is
not
a
portion
of
this
crime.
and
this
is
a
crime
were
talking
about.
now,
let's
see
what
happened
in
this
case.
i
got
my
first
indication
of
what
was
going
to
happen
when
i
made
a
motion
to
dismiss.
they
--
specifically
on
the
ground
that
intent
had
not
been
proved.
and
the
trial
judge
denied
that
and
said,
"i
think
we
better
put
up
to
the
jury
whether
the
article
is
true
or
false."
then
we
got
the
summation.
and
my
second
point
of
summation
dealt
with
intent
and
that
they
should
prove
that
we
knew
what
we
were
doing.
and
immediately,
counsel
for
appellee
got
up
and
interrupted
my
summation
and
said,
"this
is
quite
erroneous,"
and
trial
judge
said,
“well,
i
will
instruct
on
that."
then
we
got
to
the
charge.
i
had
a
specific
request
to
charge
on
intent,
request
number
six.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
page
311,
your
honor.
“even
if
you
do
find
that
the
statements
in
the
life
article
concerning
plaintiffs
were
wholly
fictitious,
you
must
nevertheless
return
a
verdict,
the
defendant,
time,
inc.,
if
you
also
find
that
time,
inc.
published
those
statements
in
the
belief
that
they
were
true.”
stating
conversely,
“you
may
not
return
a
verdict
in
favor
of
either
plaintiff
against
time,
inc.
for
having
used
their
names
either
for
trade
purposes
or
for
advertising
purposes,
unless
you
were
satisfied
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
life
article
was
pure
fiction
regarding
plaintiff's
and
that
time,
inc.'s
employees
knew
it
was
a
fiction
at
the
time
the
article
was
published.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
your
honor,
we
put
both
the
writer
who
wrote
the
article
and
the
researcher
who
checked
it
on
the
stand.
both
of
them
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there
was
no
other
testimony
by
anybody
else.
i
had
one
editor
in
court.
i
spoke
to
the
plaintiff.
i've
announced
to
the
judge
he's
in
court
if
anybody
wants
to
--
wants
to
examine
it
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
and
no
one
did.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
but
i
thought
that
would
have
the
writer
and
the
researcher,
the
two
people
who
had
to
deal
with
the
article,
both
of
them
testified
that
in
their
judgment
at
the
trail,
the
article
was
true
and
at
the
time
they
wrote
it.
they
thought
it
was
true
and
correct.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
sir
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
there
was
no
objection
to
the
instruction,
the
--
the
court
just
didn't
charge
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
i
specifically
accepted
to
the
failure
of
the
charge.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that
defendant,
time,
inc.'s
employees
knew
it
was
fiction
at
the
time
it
was
published.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
precisely
my
--
my
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
now,
we're
--
we're
talking
about
deemed
process
false
like
case.
that's
in
essence
what
we've
reduced
this
case
to.
and
--
and
as
he
said,
“it
is
high
time
that
we
realized
what
we
are
you
doing
and
give
some
consideration
to
the
question
of
where
if
anywhere
we
ought
to
call
a
halt.”
and
he
characterized
those
cases,
and
i'm
reading
from
my
original
brief,
page
23,
gone
as
the
defensive
truth
and
the
defendant
is
held
liable
for
the
publication
of
entirely
accurate
statements
of
fact
without
any
wrongful
motive.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
but
he
had
not,
your
honor,
i'm
just
getting
to
that.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
because
what
the
trial
court
said
was,
"i
give
it
to
you,
the
jury,
to
pass
on
whether
the
statements
in
the
article
constituted
fiction."
and
then
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
but
whether
the
statement
in
the
article
constituted
fiction
and
that
isn't
--
that
isn't
a
--
a
question
of
--
of
intent
there.
and
then,
the
jury
came
back.
they
were
confused
about
this
work
trade
and
they
said,
“we
like
to
know
some
more
about
it.”
and
at
that
time,
i
think
mr.
garment,
representing
the
appellee,
made
two
significant
statements
which
pointed
out
his
position
and
the
court
followed
him.
first,
he
said,
“our
claim
is
that
the
total
article
must
be
read
and
the
jury
must
determine
whether
it
conveyed
the
basically
false
impression
as
to
the
relationship
of
the
hill
family
to
the
desperate
hours,
that's
page
306
of
the
record.
and
then
the
court
said,
“well,
we're
going
to
charge
that,
the
thing
is
covered,"
and
then
--
then
mr.
garment
said,
"your
honor,
if
they
are
telling
news,
if
they
are
telling
news,
purporting
to
tell
news
but
have
as
the
basis
for
the
use
of
the
individual's
name
something
that
is
furious
or
essentially
false,
that
we
contend,"
and
i
think
the
law
is
clear,
“it
is
for
trade
purposes.”
so,
it
is
purely
a
falsity
test,
and
it's
the
same
falsity
test
which
was
applied
in
youssoupoff
and
indeed,
it
is
the
falsity
test
which
is
called
for
under
the
prior
appellate
decisions
in
new
york.
so,
all
i'm
really
saying
is
that
--
that
the
question
of
intent
never
entered
this
case
and
doesn't
enter
in
new
york
law
so
far
as
this
question
of
privacy
is
concerned.
and
that's
a
fatal
omission.
now,
when
we
got
to
the
appellate
division
in
this
case,
again,
on
intent,
we
--
we
had
mr.
justice
stevens
saying,
"the
defendant
merely
concluded
that
basically,
the
play
was
a
reenactment
and
so
stated."
again,
there's
no
question
of
intent.
it's
a
question
--
we
concluded
that
it
was
reenactment
and
so
stated.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
but
the
charge
to
the
jury,
your
honor,
you
must
find
that
the
statements
concerning
the
plaintiffs
in
the
article
constituted
fiction.
it's
a
question
of
truth
or
falsity
on
that.
and
short
fiction
connotes
in
the
ways
in
fiddling
with
the
facts
but
there
is
nothing
in
any
of
the
--
of
the
appellate
decisions
in
new
york
on
this
question
of
intent.
intent
is
entirely
disregarded
and
--
and
i
think
the
--
the
spahn
case
which
i've
read
to
you,
the
youssoupoff
case
that
we've
gone
through
and
thompson
against
close-up.
and
they
said
--
they
may
have
--
they
may
perhaps
published
something
by
mistake.
this
is
a
wrong
picture
case.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
the
court
knew
perfectly
well
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
how
they
to
knowledge.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
because
in
regarding
punitive
damage,
then
he
got
knowledge
there
alright
and
that
this
was
done
knowingly
or
through
failure
to
make
a
reasonable
investigation.
so,
he
got
the
punitive
damage,
intent
and
knowledge
came
right
in,
intent
plus
negligence.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir,
they
did.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
jury
award
on
damage
was
set
aside,
your
honor,
because
of
the
--
the
evidence
which
was
put
in
which
--
which
went
against
us
so
far
and
we're
so
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
do.
i
do.
and
all
you
have
is
compensatory.
that's
all
that
was
awarded.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
that
was
set
aside.
the
jury
verdict
was
set
aside
and
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right
because
on
the
new
trial,
this
whole
award
of
damage
by
a
judge
trying
without
a
jury
was
for
compensatory
damages.
so
the
question
of
punitive
damage
is
no
--
no
longer
here.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
it's
one
on
negligence.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
and
it's
a
strange
doctrine
that
you're
going
to
have
punitive
damages
on
negligence.
and
yet
that
is
--
that
is
precisely
what
we
have
here.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it's
synonymous
with
embellishment
or
exaggeration.
it's
a
funny
type
of
falsehood.
it
isn't
really
true
or
falsehood.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it's
not
intentional.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there's
not
the
slightest
doubt
of
that.
under
the
cases
in
general,
and
on
--
and
as
applied
in
our
case,
intent
is
not
a
factor.
and
i
say
that
we
need
that
protection
in
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
the
constitution.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that
if
it
--
if
you
don't
intend
at
all,
it'd
still
be
fiction.
it
wasn't
said
that
the
charge
was
--
is
the
article
fiction?
not
did
the
defendant
create
fiction,
which
might
connote
knowledge
and
the
charge
in
youssoupoff
was
whether
the
television
program
fiction?
was
it
true?
was
it
false?
and
--
and
that
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
is
so.
it
--
it
comes
down
to
the
question
--
and
i
think
the
sutton
versus
hearst,
the
red
rose
case
is
a
good
illustration,
of
--
of
embellishment,
of
exaggeration
a
bit,
where
the
facts
of
which
they
--
where
they
start
are
basically
true
facts
and
that's
what
caused
the
split
in
the
court
there.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
very
violent
split.
and
presiding
justice
peck
and
mr.
justice
shientag
said,
“well,
these
facts
as
we
have
them
are
basically
true
even
though
if
they
have
been
blown
up."
and
that's
all
you're
talking
about
even
in
the
binns
case,
that
original
telegraph
operator
case.
everything
where
several
different
reels
and
the
only
thing
that
was
condemned
was
the
last
one
because
it
had
a
picture
of
them
with
a
title
of
“this
big
american
smile.”
and
they
said,
“well
this
is
--
this
is
going
too
far”,
even
though
the
facts
as
to
what
he'd
done
were
basically
quite
correct.
so
it
is
not
a
truth
or
falsity
test,
it's
an
in-between
type
of
thing
so
that
you
don't
point
in
what
you're
talking
about
really.
now,
even
if
you
--
if
you
say
this
is
truth
or
falsity,
they
still
haven't
got
intent
in
this.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
the
difference
in
some
of
these
cases
comes
down
to
the
individual
judgments
of
the
judges
involved
is
whether
they
like
the
story
or
not,
which
is
precisely
the
type
of
censorship
that
the
first
amendment
is
intended
to
do
away
with.
and
to
try
and
exempt
other
cases
on
any
assumption
other
than
that
is
practically
an
impossibility.
so
that
if
you
are
trying
to
get
some
judgment
to
give
the
editor
of
life
of
what
can
you
publish,
and
you
try
to
make
sense
there,
these
new
york
cases,
you
have
ever
done
tough
job,
even
on
this
new
york
times
illustration
i
gave.
you
come
within
the
precise
language
of
gautier
and
maybe
you're
going
to
say,
“alright,
we'll
take
a
chance
and
do
it.”
but
i
say
we
shouldn't
be
in
that
position,
that
the
decent
journalist
should
be
able
to
have
some
test
they
can
follow
when
they're
deciding
what
to
publish.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
sir,
you
do
not.
your
simple
test
is
whether
it's
true
or
not
and
whether
it's
privileged
or
not.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
if
you
can
prove
it
true
it,
surely,
you
can
publish
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
it
is
not
so
much
in
between.
and
--
and
they
referred
with
the
average
decent
publication.
there's
very
little
error.
and
--
and
once
you
know
that
something
is
true,
you
know
you
can
publish
it.
now,
in
this
feeling
--
field
of
privacy,
i'm
merely
suggesting,
when
it's
non-defamatory,
and
you're
talking
about
a
public
fact,
we
should
have
the
protection
that
the
fellow
who
comes
in
to
sue
us
must
prove
a
falsity
and
knowledge
of
falsity
or
recklessness.
and
that
--
this
is
a
minimum
because
mind
you,
this
article
here,
the
dissent
in
the
appellate
division
form
was
an
informative
presentation
of
legitimate
news,
the
dissent
in
our
court
of
appeals.
it
i
understood,
the
article
is
on
its
face,
an
account
of
newsworthy
information.
certainly,
this
is
something
more
than
having
the
slightest
redeeming
social
importance
that
this
court
has
protected
in
the
average
obscenity
cases.
we're
a
long
way
from
that.
we
are
contributing
something
to
public
discussion.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
think
--
i
think
the
statute
should
be
struck
down,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir,
because
i
--
i
think
it
--
it
should
have
--
in
non-defamatory
language
of
public
events,
you
should
have
a
sine
que
non
just
as
you
had
in
new
york
times
when
dealing
with
defamatory
language
of
public
officials.
you
should
have
a
sine
que
non
of
falsity
plus
knowledge
of
falsity
or
recklessness.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir.
or
as
applied
thus
--
either
way.
but
i
think
the
statute
is
before
you.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
know
of
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
you
have
before
you
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
would
urge
upon
you
strongly
to
strike
it
down
as
being,
on
its
face,
against
and
as
interpreted
directly
against
the
constitution.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
on
its
face,
it's
clear
that
(inaudible)
but
as
construed
by
the
courts
and
that
that
construction
does
not
involve
intent
and
also
at
times
hasn't
--
has
--
has
involved
truthful
statements.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
that
comes
down
as
to
whether
you
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
or
non-negligent
false
statement.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it
may
just
be
plain
wrong
with
no
negligence
whatsoever
and
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
it
isn't
quite
--
it
is
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
it
has
come
down
to
that.
all
i'm
saying
it
--
and
--
and
the
word
“privacy”
is
what
throws
us
all
off
because
this
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
really
isn't
a
privacy
law.
it's
an
intentional
falsehood
maybe
law
with
--
with
neither
of
those
elements.
and
i'm
saying
that
intentional
falsehood
is
not
protected
by
the
constitution.
intentional
falsehood
is
really
what
you're
talking
about
when
you're
talking
about
defamation,
except
that
the
states
have
given
you
a
little
aid
and
make
the
defendant
a
sitting
duck
by
presuming
both
intent
and
falsehood.
now,
you
yanked
out
of
the
presumptions
defamatory
language
dealing
with
public
officials
as
entitled
to
the
protections
that
plaintiff
must
prove
in
this
case.
i'm
saying
that
non-defamatory
language
which
is
the
run
--
one
of
the
middle
language
of
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
the
press,
non-defamatory
language
of
public
facts
deserves
the
same
protection
as
certainly
as
defamatory
language
about
public
officials.
if
you're
going
to
have
free
public
discussion.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
for
a
non-defamatory
language
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
about
public
fact
because
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
but
we're
not
--
that
isn't
involved
here
and
that's
why
i've
been
careful
because
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
because
if
you're
going
to
get
into
the
--
the
private
area,
you
--
you
have
--
have
some
entirely
different
problems.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
you're
dealing
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no.
you're
dealing
with
something
which
was
a
newsworthy
event
two
and
half
years
before
our
articles,
sufficient
so
as
on
the
front
pages
of
every
--
of
every
paper
in
the
country.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
now,
at
that
point,
you're
no
longer
dealing
with
a
private
fact.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
your
test
whether
it's
a
newsworthy
item
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i'm
talking
whether
public
or
private.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
i
say
once
is
public
is
public.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
now,
you're
going
to
have
to
define
as
to
newsworthy
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
for
general
interest.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well
[laughter]
dr.
michael
john
whom
you
know
said
that
the
citizens
have
not
delegated
their
authority
to
decide
for
themselves
what
they
shall
read
and
write.
and
when
you're
talking
about
non-defamatory
language,
that's
precisely
his
point
and
it's
precisely
mine.
but
you
cannot
have
freedom
of
discussion
without
--
of
non-defamatory
language
unless
you
give
the
protection
of
saying
“if
you're
false
and
you
know
you're
false,
my
gosh,
you'll
get
hit.”
but
up
until
that
point,
you
should
be
able
freely
to
discuss
matters.
and
that's
the
very
simple
test
that
--
that
i
propose.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
because
that's
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
not
involved
here.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
alright.
you
going
to
put
a
camera
into
someone's
bedroom
because
you're
going
to
invade
the
home.
you
have
the
intrusion
cases.
you
have
a
multitude
of
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
different
places.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
she
was
right
out
in
the
public
street.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
in
her
store
for
--
for
the
public,
it's
still
public.
now,
that's
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
the
number
of
different
--
of
different
types
of
privacy
problems
is
illustrated
best
by
processing
this,
what
i
said
his
--
these
are
his
false
light
cases
we're
dealing
with
now.
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
saying
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
forget
the
label
privacy
here.
you
can
start
and
to
think
--
correct
yourself
that
if
you
have
non-defamatory
language
about
a
public
event,
again
or
public
fact,
that
you
can
use
that
language
all
you
want
as
long
as
you
don't
falsify
and
intentionally
falsify.
now,
that's
what
you've
said
in
new
york
times.
it
is
applicable
to
defamatory
language
about
public
officials.
and
i
say
the
same
rule
should
apply
to
non-defamatory
language.
that's
--
that's
the
bread
and
butter
of
all
of
these,
no
normal
speech,
no
normal
talking
and
--
and
you
don't
have
the
red
flag
of
defamatory
language.
if
an
editor
has
something
or
is
saying
something
really
bad
about
someone,
he
knows
darn
well,
there's
a
red
flag
there
and
he's
going
to
have
to
prove
its
true
or
he
can't
print
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
sir.
there's
a
--
there's
a
great
area
of
the
law
dealing
with
the
electronic
spying
in
someone's
bedroom,
going
to
someone's
home
and
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
you
would
have
a
--
you
would
have
a
much
tougher
case
if
mr.
hill
instead
of
telling
for
everybody
about
this
incident
and
the
people
coming
in
have
said
nothing,
he
just
sits
in
his
home
knows
--
knows
these
convicts
have
been
in
and
did
nothing.
now,
i
still
think
we
might
have
a
right
if
it's
tied
into
the
play
to
say
something
about.
that's
a
much
more
difficult
case.
if
he
--
if
he'd
done
nothing,
then
no
one
knew
about
it.
but
this
is
a
public
fact.
i'm
not
--
i'm
trying
to
suggest
that
you
restrict
yourself
in
this
case
to
the
false
light
cases
of
dean
prosser
and
to
public
facts
and
to
non-defamatory
discussion
of
public
facts.
you
may
want
to
go
beyond
them
later
on
but
that's
all
this
case
involves.
and
i'm
suggesting
that
with
those
--
with
--
with
that
type
of
a
fact,
the
non-defamatory
discussion
that
we
should
have
both
intent
and
falsity.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
i
started
to
argue
intent
in
my
summation,
mr.
garment
got
up
and
said,
“your
honor,
with
a
great
difference,
i
rise
at
this
point
to
object
to
these
statements.”
so
that
intent,
even
when
i
started
to
argue
it
in
summation,
was
objected
to
by
the
other
side.
a
couple
of
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
judge
said,
“now,
i'll
take
care
of
it,
my
charge.”
and
then
of
course
the
charges
have
came
out
as
i've
already
discussed,
said,
“were
the
statements
in
the
article
are
matter
of
fiction.”
nothing
to
do
with
intent
again.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
started
to
argue
intent
to
the
jury
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
and
was
--
and
i
kept
on
argument
but
i
was
cut
--
but
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
after
starting
the
argument,
objection
by
the
other
side
and
the
judge
said,
“you
are
very
right.
i'll
take
care
of
it,
my
charge.”
the
obvious
inference
from
that
is
that
intent
is
out
of
the
case.
and
indeed,
that's
what
--
what
happened
as
i
--
as
i
detailed
in
my
main
argument
yesterday.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
had
a
specific
request
of
charge
on
intent.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
on
intent.
that's
charge
number
6,
that
i
--
that
i
read
to
the
court
yesterday.
and
i
objected
to
the
failure
to
make
that
charge
except
as
specifically.
first,
on
the
court
of
appeals,
the
blumenthal
case
was
an
affirmance
without
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
redmond
and
franklin
and
gautier
cases
were
all
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
this
--
we
have
more
affirmative
court
of
appeals
than
perhaps
mr.
nixon
indicated.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
--
that's
my
next
point
--
that's
my
next
point,
your
honor.
at
the
time
that
mr.
justice
raiben's
opinion
was
written,
and
at
the
time
when
it
was
specifically
affirmed
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
basis
of
that
opinion,
we
were
saying
that
the
article
was
true.
until
we
reached
this
court,
our
position
throughout
has
been
that
this
was
a
true
article
in
the
broad
sweep
of
it.
so
that
this
was
specifically
an
answer
to
our
contention
that
the
article
was
true.
and
when
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
both
opinions,
what
they
in
effect
were
doing
was
precisely
the
same
thing
they
did
in
the
gautier
case
in
1952
of
referring
back
to
blumenthal
and
saying,
“this
true
item,
we're
not
going
to
allow.”
but
it
was
an
answer
to
our
contention
that
it
was
true,
so
this
was
no
dictum.
moreover,
the
dissent
in
the
appellate
division
by
mr.
justice
botein,
dealt
specifically
with
this
point
of
mr.
justice
raiben's.
and
the
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals
by
mr.
justice
fuld
joined
in
by
mr.
justice
bergan,
again
dealt
specifically
with
that
point,
so
that
i
say
this
was
no
dictum,
this
was
a
direct
holding
in
answer
to
our
contention
that
the
article
was
true.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
when
in
--
when
in
its
--
in
--
it
is
in
answer
to
our
specific
contention
that
the
article
is
true,
it
seems
to
me
is
no
longer
dictum.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
still
think
that
i'm
entitled
to
win
whether
you
--
whether
you
have
that
as
dictum
or
not.
that's
just
one
point
and
one
ground.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
still
have
my
basic
intent
point
in
this
whole
case.
and
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i'm
saying
that
we
have
an
error
in
the
--
in
the
use
of
the
word
“reenacted”.
now,
i
still
say
that
the
article
can
be
interpreted
as
basically
true
in
that
it's
a
story
of
a
family
terrified
by
convicts.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
the
sting
of
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
of
course
not,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
of
course
not,
your
honor.
it
--
it
is
the
question
of
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
it's
a
question
of
which
test
of
truth
you
use
is
--
is
the
difference
between
the
british
and
american
viewpoint
that
i
gave
you
yesterday
as
to
whether
you're
saying
basically
the
net
effect
of
this
is
a
family
terrified
or
not.
i
do
have
to
say
that
we
have
error
in
the
word
“reenacted”
and
that's
why
i'm
in
this
court
on
the
error
and
saying
it's
unintentional
error.
but
i
--
i
come
back
again
on
a
question
of
standing
that
we,
throughout
the
lower
courts,
said
this
article
was
basically
true.
and
if
this
true
crime
in
this
by
this
tenth
play,
i'm
an
eskimo,
it
certainly
did.
and
--
and
that's
the
basic
point.
now,
lastly,
i
just
want
to
thank
you
for
the
courtesy
of
allowing
us
this
reargument
because
i
think
this
case
is
--
is
of
great
importance
in
an
endeavor
to
do
in
privacy
what
you
did
in
libel.
we've
gone
through
this
case
in
11
years.
i've
been
talking
about
the
constitution
throughout
the
new
york
courts.
and
until
we
got
to
this
court,
no
one
realized
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
had
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
and
i
say
it's
time
that
this
court
made
it
quite
clear
to
the
state
courts
that
the
constitution
does
have
something
to
do
with
this.
and
that
when
you
have
non-defamatory
language
about
a
public
fact
that
you
shouldn't
be
held
accountable
unless
you
have
falsity
and
knowledge
of
falsity
or
recklessness.
and
i
state
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there
was
no
such
evidence
in
the
files
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
well,
that
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right
and
of
course
that's
the
point
of
our
reply
brief.
if
you
want
to
go
through
the
record
page
by
page,
as
mr.
justice
black
did
and
said
any
reasonable
person
would
think
that
the
--
that
the
play
was
inspired
by
this
incident,
if
you
go
through
the
record
on
that,
the
papers
in
the
file
upon
which
this
article
was
based
show
no
such
thing.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no,
sir.
they
are
not,
of
course.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
word
“reenactment”
has
an
ambiguous
frame
of
reference
in
the
article
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
ambiguity
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
have
to
accept
the
ambiguity
being
decided
against
me
in
this
court.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
did
not
in
new
york
courts,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
think
you'll
find
it
in
the
appellate
division
that
the
word
“reenactment”
was
inaccurately
used.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
inaccurately
used
is
what
precludes
me.
when
i
get
to
this
court
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
--
i
have
to
accept
that
as
a
statement
of
fact.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
if
the
word
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there
is
no
knowingly
false,
that
was
my
last
point,
the
last
argument
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
if
you
assume
that
there
is
falsity
and
that
we
knew
there
was
falsity,
of
course,
we
should
be
held
and
that's
been
my
point
from
the
start.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there's
no
constitutional
protection
for
that.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
test
under
new
york
statute
has
nothing
to
do
with
knowledge
of
falsity.
it
is
a
malice
test
in
terms
of
presuming
intent
to
increase
circulation.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
think
it
should
fit
all
cases
under
first
amendment
and
specifically
non-defamatory
language
we
have
used
about
a
public
fact.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
there
is
no
charge
on
intent
or
malice
whatsoever
except
with
the
punitive
damages
whether
we
do
not
knowingly
or
--
or
negligently.
but
so
far
as
liability
or
not,
the
--
the
charge
had
nothing
to
do
with
intent
or
malices.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
the
--
the
appellate
division
decision
found
specifically
that
we
did
not
know
it.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it
was
not
tried
in
intentional
intent
whatsoever.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
and
indeed,
the
whole
record
shows,
there
was
no
intent.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
you're
precluded
by
the
finding
of
fact
of
the
appellate
division
when
it
said
--
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
it
still
was
not
a
question
that
was
--
was
ever
put
to
the
jury.
it
hasn't
been
passed
upon
by
the
jury.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
i
still
should
win.
mr.
harold
r.
medina,
jr.
yes,
sir.
