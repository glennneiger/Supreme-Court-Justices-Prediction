mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
the
fundamental
issue
here
cannot
be
determined
unless
there
is
a
judgment
with
regard
to
the
facts.
there
has
been
discussion
to
the
effect
that
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
life
article
is
not
material
and
should
not
raise
a
constitutional
question.
but
if
the
court
would
permit,
i
would
like
to
present
the
facts
as
we
see
them
for
a
moment.
and
in
doing
so,
let
me
read
from
the
reply
brief
of
the
defendant.
the
desperate
hours
in
a
very
fundamental
way
was
the
reenactment
of
the
hill
incident
and
the
life
article
was
accurate
and
substantially
more
accurate
than
it
needed
to
be
to
gain
first
amendment
protection.
and
later
on,
the
differences
are
superficial
differences.
now,
as
my
argument
will
develop,
if
those
statements
or
conclusions
are
correct,
this
decision
by
this
court
of
new
york
should
be
reversed
both
on
constitutional
grounds
and
also,
i
would
say
parenthetically
that
this
case
would
not
qualify
for
liability
under
the
law
of
new
york.
let
us
turn
to
the
facts
for
a
moment.
was
this
a
reenactment?
now
the
court
has
some
primary
documents
which
it
can
examine
to
answer
that
question.
therefore,
one,
the
life
article,
two,
the
play,
three,
the
current
news
accounts
which
are
in
the
record
written
at
the
time
the
play
came
out,
and
four,
an
article
by
the
author
written
at
the
time
the
play
came
out
indicating
his
view
as
to
whether
the
play
was
a
reenactment.
looking
to
the
point
of
whether
the
play
was
a
reenactment
however,
i
think
it
is
fundamentally
necessary
for
us
to
get
away
from
the
superficial
and
i
would
state
that
they
are
those
similarities
or
differences
as
far
as
the
cast
of
characters
in
the
stage
setting
are
concerned.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
or
not
it
happens
that
the
hill
family,
there
were
five
children
and
in
the
fictional
family
there
were
two
children.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
this
incident
may
have
taken
place
in
early
fall
or
late
fall
that
in
the
hill
incident,
it
occurred
in
philadelphia
and
that
in
the
fictional
incident,
it
occurred
in
indianapolis
or
that
the
house
in
the
hill
case
was
a
three-storey
house
and
the
house
in
the
case
of
the
fictional
story
was
a
two-storey
house.
all
of
those
factors
whether
they
are
similarities
or
differences
relate
to
the
cast
of
characters
into
the
stage
setting.
and
as
the
member
of
this
court,
i
think
we'll
agree,
the
cast
of
characters
in
stage
setting
tell
us
no
more
about
a
play
than
a
picture
frame
tells
us
about
a
portrait
or
a
painting.
the
question
with
regard
to
the
portrait
is
what's
on
the
canvass?
and
the
key
question
with
regard
to
the
play,
what
took
place
in
the
play?
what
went
on?
now
on
that
point,
we
have
some
primary
evidence
and
it
comes
directly
from
the
article
itself.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
reading
of
the
life
article
can
lead
to
no
conclusion
except
that
those
individuals
who
go
to
the
play,
playing
at
the
barrymore
theatre
at
that
time
would
see
a
reenactment
of
an
incident
which
happened
to
the
hills.
the
reading
of
the
article
and
of
the
pictures
which
of
course
were
the
heart
of
the
article
would
lead
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i'm
saying
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
life
told
its
readers
that
the
play
was
a
reenactment
of
the
hill
incident
and
that
that
was
the
message
that
life
got
across
and
therefore
the
play
therefore
becomes
quite
material
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
exactly.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
when
we
look
at
the
hill
incident
and
the
play,
we
have
incidents
that
instead
of
being
similar
except
as
--
for
the
cast
of
characters
in
the
stage
settings
are
concerned
are
as
far
apart
as
they
could
possibly
be.
let's
look
at
the
hill
incident
for
a
moment.
what
made
it
a
particularly
unusual
hostage
instance?
what
made
that
particularly
unusual
hostage
incident
was
the
fact
that
it
had
an
absence
of
violence.
as
mrs.
hill
pointed
out,
the
convicts
acted
like
perfect
gentlemen
in
time
magazine
in
a
current
news
report
precociously
said
and
titled
its
account,
house
party
because
a
complete
lack
of
violence.
now
what
made
the
play
a
hit?
it
wasn't
the
fact
that
it
was
just
about
hostage
instances
or
that
because
it
happened
to
relate
to
the
hill
incident
which
it
didn't
but
what
made
the
play
a
hit
was
that
it
took
an
old
theme
as
the
new
york
times
review
pointed
out
which
many
times
have
been
written
about
in
plays
it
as
novels.
and
that
the
author
quoting
again
from
the
new
york
times
review,
melt
the
last
drop
of
horror
from
this
macabre
situation.
so
you
have
the
hill
incident
distinguished
for
the
fact
that
it
lacked
violence
completely
and
you
have
a
play,
a
three-day
reign
of
terror.
but
notice,
he
would
--
life
do
it
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
under
those
circumstances
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
would
be
no
liability
under
the
law
of
new
york.
because
under
the
law
of
new
york,
and
this
was
one
of
the
problem
of
falsity
and
truth
is
very
apart.
under
the
law
of
new
york,
the
test
of
whether
an
article
is
for
purposes
of
trade
depends
upon
fictionalization.
if
it
is
a
true
account
of
a
newsworthy
event
then
even
though
it
goes
back
many,
many
years
referring
earlier
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
then
a
true
account
incurs
no
liability.
but
it's
only
when
the
publisher
falsifies,
fictionalizes
the
term
that
is
used
in
the
new
york
cases,
the
relationship
between
a
past
event
and
the
plaintiff
and
falsifies
for
the
purpose
of
--
purposes
of
trade
in
order
of
course
to
make
it
a
more
newsy
salable
article.
it
is
then
only
that
liability
incurs.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
fortas
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
the
statute
states
basically
liability
on
the
basis
of
two
tests.
one,
advertising
which
is
relevantly
clear,
the
use
of
an
ad
even
there,
there
are
exceptions.
but
second,
for
the
purposes
of
trade.
now,
if
for
purposes
of
trades
had
not
been
over
a
period
of
60
years
been
very
narrowly
interpreted
by
the
new
york
statutes
to
include
only
those
instances
where
there
had
been
falsification
amounting
to
fictionalization,
this
statute
i
believe
would
be
subject
to
constitutional
question.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
well,
the
new
york
cases
going
back
over
a
period
of
years
have
held
that
where
there
is
a
true
account,
a
true
account
of
a
past
situation
that
there
is
no
liability,
the
leading
case
in
that
respect
is
the
sidis
case,
a
case
which
involved
actually
a
very
sad
situation.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
a
genius
who
was
newsworthy
at
that
time
giving
instructions
when
he
was
11
years
of
old
to
people
on
higher
mathematics
at
harvard
and
then
with
the
sensitivities
somewhere
in
times
characteristic
of
genius
retreating
into
private
life.
a
quarter
of
a
century
later,
dug
up
with
the
new
yorker
magazine
in
a
story
written
about
it.
the
story
entitled
“april
fool”.
he'd
been
born
in
april
fool's
day.
and
yet
the
new
york
court
in
indication
of
its
concern
for
the
first
amendment
in
this
case
refused
to
hold
the
publications
liable
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
true
account
of
what
had
been
a
newsworthy
event
and
in
which
there
was
still
an
interested
news.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i
would
say
that
as
far
as
the
question
of
liability
is
concerned,
that
question
is
foreclosed
if
i
understand
your
question.
that
question
is
foreclosed
insofar
as
any
report
that
is
true.
on
that
particular
point,
it
is
clear
that
the
new
york
cases
lay
down
a
very
strict
test
that
there
could
be
no
liability
without
fictionalization.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
did.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
not
specifically
except
i
would
say
there
was
a
relationship
to
it
mr.
justice
fortas
in
a
sense.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
true.
but
i
would
say
that
when
you
read
all
of
the
cases
in
new
york
going
back
over
60
years,
it
will
be
found
that
the
new
york
courts
recognized
that
if
for
the
pur
--
if
the
phrase
for
purposes
of
trade
were
interpreted
in
a
broad
sense
to
mean
that
any
time
a
publisher
took
a
newsworthy
item
and
used
it
for
purposes
of
increasing
circulation
that
that
would
be
an
invasion
of
privacy.
the
new
york
courts
recognized
that
that
would
run
into
first
amendment
problems.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
i
think
that
is
--
i
would
say
that
while
that
may
not
have
been
specifically
mentioned
from
a
constitutional
sense
--
point
in
sidis,
i
believe
that
that
was
the
basis
for
the
court's
conclusion
in
sidis.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
may
i
get
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
my
view,
where
we
have
in
this
new
field
of
the
law
which
this
court
has
not
yet
spoken.
where
we
have
a
situation
of
a
newsworthy
event
even
though
there
has
been
a
passage
of
time
and
then
a
state
attempting
to
protect
the
“right
of
privacy”,
i
believe
that
you
would
run
into
a
very
difficult
constitutional
question
in
the
event
that
liability
incurred
when
the
account
was
truthful.
i
believe
that
the
new
york
test
which
provides
for
liability
only
if
there's
a
combination
of
three
circumstances,
one,
the
use
of
the
proper
name,
two,
a
fictionalized
account
primary
and
substantial
insofar
as
the
statement
is
concerned
and
three,
fictionalizing
for
the
purposes
of
trade
which
means,
falsehood
for
commercial
purposes.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i've
--
excuse,
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
narrow
finding
in
this
case
in
new
york
and
the
state
of
the
facts
before
the
court
here
today
is
the
use
of
false
statements
to
invade
privacy
for
purposes
of
trade.
and
only
in
the
event
that
it
was
a
fictionalized
account
and
i
go
further,
not
only
must
to
be
fictionalized,
it
must
be
primary,
the
individual
who
sues
must
be
the
primary
subject
to
the
account
and
as
far
as
the
fictionalization
is
concerned,
it
must
impair
the
essential
accuracy
of
the
whole
account.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
brennan
that
is
exactly
the
point.
the
new
york
cases
because
of
their
concern
in
my
point
--
in
my
opinion
and
i
will
agree
with
mr.
justice
fortas,
they
may
not
specifically
have
referred
to
this
in
each
instance
but
because
of
their
concern
for
first
amendment
considerations,
the
new
york
cases
have
said
that
purposes
of
trade
requires
a
fictionalized
account
otherwise
you
would
have
a
situation
where
any
publisher
would
be
liable
for
publishing
news
and
that
would
be
certainly
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
we
get
there
mr.
justice
white
as
to
whether
or
not
in
the
case
there
has
been
fictionalization
there
should
be
the
element
of
malice
in
the
testing
of
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
of
the
sullivan
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
and
new
york
times
case.
i
would
say
that
in
the
--
that
in
this
particular
case
looking
at
the
facts
of
this
case
that
there
was
knowledge
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
there
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
under
new
york
law,
it
would
be
my
view
that
in
the
event
of
lack
of
knowledge,
in
the
event
that
there
was
fictionalization
in
the
sense
of
staging
not
a
current
new
story,
let
me
make
it
clear.
mr.
medina
has
referred
to
several
current
news
stories.
there
is
no
new
york
case
that
has
held
liability
in
60
years
for
a
current
news
story.
in
every
instance
fictionalization
has
required
a
passage
of
time.
it
has
required
stages.
it
required
contrivance.
now
your
case
would
be
one
where
you
had
staging.
there
had
been
a
passage
of
time
that
it
was
a
contrived
situation
but
the
individual
did
it
in
good
faith
believing
that
it
was
correct
and
yet
it
was
false.
in
my
view,
he
would
be
liable
under
the
case
of
new
york
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
but
that
was
not
the
finding
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
new
york
would
impose
liability
in
such
a
case.
i
know
of
new
york
--
i've
known
a
new
york
case
where
that
has
happened.
i
recognize
what
mr.
--
what
the
justice
is
getting
at
but
this
was
a
possibility
for
the
future
but
let
me
make
one
thing
very
clear
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
were
it
to
be
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
legal
standard.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
well
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
let
me
come
back
to
the
fundamental
point.
the
new
york
cases
require
fictionalization.
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
think
of
a
state
of
facts
in
which
there
has
been
a
passage
of
time,
fictionalization
requires
that,
in
which
there
is
staging,
in
which
the
individual
whose
name
is
used
without
his
consent
is
the
primary
subject
and
in
which
the
fictionalization
is
--
impairs
the
essential
accuracy
where
that
could
happen
without
knowledge
and
i
would
say
that
it
would
amount
mr.
justice
white
if
not
to
knowledge
certainly
to
reckless
disregard
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
because
of
the
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
fictionalization
is
a
conscious
act.
fictionalization
under
the
new
york
cases
is
conscious.
you
would
put
a
hypothetical
case
which
i
do
not
think
could
ever
happen
but
my
view
is
that
since
fictionalization
connotes
conscious
knowledge
that
this
means
that
you
would
either
have
conscious
knowledge
or
certainly
at
the
very
least
a
reckless
disregard
of
the
facts
which
you
had
here
in
any
event.
could
i
spend
one
moment
with
regard
to
the
differences
between
this
play
because
the
point
of
fictionalization
becomes
critical.
if
this
play
was
a
reenactment,
a
substantial
reenactment
then
there
is
a
constitutional
problem
here.
now
the
members
of
this
court
know
life
magazine
that
it
tells
its
stories
through
pictures.
and
also
the
members
of
this
court
are
aware
of
the
fact
that
life
magazine
being
the
most
popular
of
the
picture
magazines
does
not
use
pictures
that
relate
superficial
events.
they
go
to
the
heart
of
the
case.
now,
the
court
passed
on
--
in
its
records,
it's
the
first
piece
of
evidence,
it
has
the
life
story.
and
if
you
will
take
your
attention
for
the
moment
to
the
pictures,
there
are
six
which
are
used
in
this
article.
now,
understand
this
is
the
article
about
the
play
which
the
appellant
says
is
a
reenactment
in
which
the
differences
are
superficial.
there
are
six
pictures.
the
picture
in
the
first
page,
two
convicts
in
the
living
room
harangued
the
daughter
while
the
mother,
nancy

that
didn't
happen
in
the
hill
incident.
go
to
the
second
page
entitled
"true
crime,
three
crises
at
a
backdoor",
and
the
picture
there
at
the
real
house
where
the
family
was
trapped,
the
actress
you've
seen
from
the
play.
here,
daughter
cindy
stalls
off
her
beau
from
entering
the
home.
that
didn't
happen
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
to
the
hills.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
chief
justice,
cindy
stalls
off
her
beau
from
entering
the
home
at
the
real
house.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
now
cindy
is
the
daughter
and
she
stalls
off
her
beau
later
on
her
beau
incidentally
gets
into
the
house
and
is
wounded
in
this
play
which
mr.
medina
has
characterized
as
not
having
any
particularly
ugly
factors.
then
the
next
picture
in
that
page,
a
brave
tried
to
save
the
family
fails
when
the
father
has
to
toss
out
a
gun
because
the
son
is
held
as
hostage.
that
didn't
happen
in
the
hill
incident.
there
were
no
heroics
in
the
part
of
the
son
or
the
father
or
the
daughter
or
any
other
member
of
the
family.
and
then
the
next
picture,
their
(inaudible)
--
first
hope
for
rescue
comes
when
a
trash
collector
chats
with
the
wife
and
senses
something
is
wrong.
he
is
killed
in
the
play
but
his
death
puts
the
police
in
the
trail.
that
didn't
happen
to
the
hills.
no
trash
collector
came
to
the
house,
no
one
was
killed,
not
the
trash
collector,
not
the
two
convicts
who
were
killed
in
the
play
and
no
one
was
wounded
as
was
the
boyfriend.
now,
let's
go
to
the
next
page.
and
here
we
find
robish,
the
brutish
convict.
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
--
there,
it
says,
brutish
convict
(inaudible)
up
the
young
son
ralphie
who
shows
his
fang
by
talking
up
to
the
criminals.
incidentally,
as
we
look
at
that
picture,
you
can
look
at
appellant's
brief
and
note
that
the
violence
was
rather
mild
but
i
submit
that
wrapping
up
is
certainly
can't
be
characterized
as
less
than
violence
and
i
think
less
than
ugly.
and
then
the
next
picture,
daring
daughter
bites
the
hand
of
the
youngest
convict.
that
didn't
happen
in
the
play.
and
then
finally,
and
this
was
the
critical
point
of
the
play,
feverish
father
cleverly
foist
off
unloaded
gun
on
the
leader
paul
newman,
saves
his
son,
saves
the
family,
the
convicts
are
killed
as
a
result
of
this
brilliant
move
in
his
part.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
reason
that
truth
or
falsity
bears
not
only
on
liability
in
new
york
courts
but
bears
on
first
amendment
is
this.
in
the
event
that
there
was
a
newsworthy
event
and
if
life
magazine
had
repub
--
had
published
accurately
even
under
a
stage
situation,
the
relationship
of
the
hills
to
that
event,
i
believe
that
would
raise
a
grave
constitutional
question
because
you
then
get
into
the
point
that
once
you're
in
the
news,
always
in
the
news,
what
the
new
york
courts
have
said
here
however
and
i
think
that
it
is
an
appropriate
distinction
is
that
once
an
individual
is
involuntarily
in
the
news
as
was
the
case
with
the
hill's
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
involuntarily
in
the
news,
as
was
the
case
of
the
hill's,
as
was
brought
out
a
moment
ago.
it's
ridiculous
to
believe
that
he
called
a
press
conference
and
brought
his
little
microphone
out
from
the
house.
mr.
hill
and
his
family,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
in
all
the
evidence
clearly
demonstrates
that
this
is
a
classic
case
of
privacy
not
only
did
they
do
not
seek
publicity,
they
refused
to
go
in
the
ed
sullivan
show.
they
refused
--
mr.
hill
wrote
a
letter
to
one
author
who
wanted
to
write
an
article
and
share
the
proceeds
with
him
and
why?
not
because
they
were
interested
in
the
price
that
they
were
going
to
get
for
privacy
but
because
privacy
to
them
was
priceless.
that
is
why
defendants
attempt
throughout
this
case
to
downgrade
privacy,
downgrade
it
and
to
say
that
invasions
of
privacy
insofar
as
(inaudible)
--
i
mean
false
statements
with
regard
to
privacy
have
a
--
as
i
understand
it
more
value,
social
value
than
false
statements
regarding
defamation
makes
no
sense.
this
it
seems
to
me
is
an
area
of
the
law
which
deserves
a
paramount
measure
of
protection
because
certainly,
it
is
an
area
where
like
belief
as
mr.
emerson
has
pointed
out
in
a
recent
article,
it's
an
area
where
you
have
the
fundamental
problem
that
confronts
all
americans
today
and
that
is
how
does
an
individual
remain
an
individual
in
our
mass
communication
society?
but
i
digressed
if
i
can
come
to
the
--
again
to
the
point.
the
reason
that
the
constitutional
point
is
tied
in
to
the
falsity
is
that
unless
you
have
the
use
of
false
statements
for
commercial
purposes
that
then
you
would
have
a
serious
constitutional
problem.
if
it
was
a
true
account
of
what
the
hills
have
done
even
though
it
did
invade
their
privacy.
in
my
view,
it
would
raise
questions
not
only
in
new
york
where
there
would
be
no
liability
but
it
could
potentially
raise
constitutional
questions.
now,
that
case
is
not
before
this
court
because
the
only
--
there
are
other
cases
and
other
jurisdictions
which
defendant
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
melvin
versus
reid
which
raises
that
very
point.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
current
--
mr.
justice
fortas,
current
news
under
all
the
new
york
cases
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
new
york
statute.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
where
it
is
a
current
news
event,
it
does
fall
it
seems
to
me
under
the
bond
of
the
first
amendment
and
there
is
a
distinction
and
a
very
appropriate
one
that
could
be
made.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
in
this
whole
first
amendment
context
where
this
court
has
been
so
involved
in
the
past
two
to
three
years.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
protecting
individual
rights
whether
it's
in
defamation
or
privacy,
this
new
right
that
is
now
before
this
court
while
at
the
same
time,
having
a
maximum
commitment
to
freedom
of
expression.
now
in
the
event
that
liability
were
imposed
for
a
current
news
story.
for
example,
a
current
review
of
the
play
using
the
hill's
name.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
would
raise
a
serious
first
amendment
problem.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
is
involved
here
in
the
test
of
fictionalization
if
i
may
say
so
is
protecting
the
“right
of
privacy”
but
with
a
maximum
commitment
of
the
first
amendment
by
requiring
that
there
must
be
a
conscious
action
on
the
part
of
the
publisher
in
which
he
falsely
connects
the
individual
with
a
newsworthy
event
where
he
does
harm
through
falsehood.
if
i
could
--
for
mr.
justice
brennan's
benefit
particularly
explore
that
point
one
bit
further.
defendant
has
suggested
as
the
test
for
this
cases
that
where
we
have
any
connection
between
the
person
whose
name
is
used
and
a
past
newsworthy
event
that
that
gives
an
absolute
license
to
lie
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
if
there
is
any
connection
for
example,
that
means
you
could
take
any
hostage
instance
and
write
about
it.
write
about
it
and
say
that
it
related
to
this
particular
play.
i
would
say
that
that
kind
of
a
test
is
one
that,
it
seems
to
me,
meets
no
constitutional
standard
and
i
would
suggest
also
that
it
would
give
a
license
not
to
responsible
publications
like
life
magazine
who
very
seldom
make
mistakes
like
this
but
to
every
(inaudible)
scandal
sheet
in
the
country
to
take
private
persons
or
even
public
persons
who
for
the
moment
had
been
in
the
public
eye
and
then
years
later
because
there
were
some
connection
with
event
fictionalized,
lie
about
them
for
purposes
of
trade.
and
that's
why
we
must
understand
that
life
took
this
argument
and
proceeded
to
say
that
this
was
a
reenactment
of
the
hill
incident.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
is.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
requires
that.
if
i
can
ex
--
go
on
in
that
point
for
one
second
longer,
i
believe
that
the
test
of
fictionalization
as
applied
to
the
tort
of
privacy
is
a
more
appropriate
test
for
privacy
cases
than
the
malice
test
of
new
york
times
and
sullivan
as
applied
to
defamation.
and
i'm
going
to
suggest
something
out
that
may
surprise
the
court.
i
believe
that
the
test
of
fictionalization
as
applied
to
privacy
by
the
new
york
courts
gives
greater
protection
to
freedom
of
the
press
an
expression
than
does
the
malice
test
in
the
new
york
times.
let's
look
at
the
differences
for
fictionalization
and
for
liability
to
be
found,
one,
the
proper
name
must
be
used,
new
york
times,
rosenblatt
and
baer,
you
had
a
problem
with
names.
you
don't
have
that
problem
here.
second,
it
must
be
primary
in
the
article.
that
is
not
a
requirement
in
defamation.
third,
the
defamation
or
i
should
say
the
fault
statements
in
fictionalization
must
affect
the
essential
accuracy
of
the
whole
article,
incidental
inaccuracy
is
enough
in
defamation.
and
fourth,
it
is
necessary
that
the
fictionalization
be
for
purposes
of
trade,
commercial
in
per
--
terms
of
defamation
there
is
no
need
that
the
fictionalization
of
the
fault
statements
were
used
to
serve
the
commercial
purposes
of
the
publisher.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
now
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
black,
the
charge
does
not
put
liability
on
that
narrow
ground
alone.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
charge
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
no,
that
--
that
they
--
what
the
charge
says
is
that
only
if
the
jury
finds
that
one
--
that
these
three
factors
come
together.
one,
the
use
of
a
name
in
a
fictionalized
context
for
purposes
of
trade.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
that
is
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
black,
you
have
put
your
finger
on
the
reason
why
the
new
york
courts
have
insisted
on
providing
for
and
requiring
the
element
of
false
statement
or
fictionalization
because
otherwise
it
is
absolutely
true
that
newspapers
and
magazines
publish
their
articles
for
purposes
of
trade.
but
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
the
purposes
of
trade
test
is
not
met
unless
the
publication
fictionalized
the
plaintiff's
connection
with
the
event.
in
other
words,
where
instead
of
publishing
news
about
the
plaintiff,
it
published
a
fictionalized
account
which
is
very
different
from
news
with
what
were
to
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
not
unless
it
invades
privacy.
not
unless
there's
damage.
not
unless
it
is
primary
and
not
unless
it
is
factually
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
any
publication
does
in
the
general
sense
but
i
should
point
out
that
in
60
years,
the
new
york
courts
had
been
--
have
followed
a
very
narrow
line
of
definition
in
this
particular
field
because
of
their
concern
for
first
amendment
problems.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
exactly.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it's
a
fictionalized
version
for
profit.
let
me
bring
it
back
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
and
mr.
justice
black,
unless
the
new
york
courts
had
been
very
scrupulous
in
insisting
that
there'd
be
any
additional
element
of
fictionalization,
i
would
say
that
this
new
york
statute
would
have
very
great
difficulties
in
the
constitutional
point.
let
me
emphasize
again
that
the
reason
that
life
magazine
did
this
is
i
think
in
the
testimony
where
they
say
one
of
their
researchers,
it
was
a
good
gimmick.
they
were
using
these
people
as
props.
this
was
the
hoax.
they
were
using
them
as
props
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
article
more
readable
and
for
selling
more
magazines.
now
let
me
say,
if
they
stated
the
truth
about
these
people,
that
would
have
been
perfectly
within
their
constitutional
rights
but
when
--
what
they
did
was
to
use
them
in
a
fictionalized
context
for
the
purposes
of
trade
then
certainly
this
does
not
present
a
constitutional
problem.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i
would
say
that
based
on
all
of
the
new
york
cases
and
obviously,
i
must
limit
my
answer
to
those
cases
over
a
period
of
60
years
that
all
of
the
new
york
cases
have
held
that
the
element
of
fictionalization
must
be
present
in
order
to
have
a
violation
under
the
statute
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
because
fictionalization
is
the
essential
element
to
prove
purposes
of
trade.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
where
you
have
the
--
and
so
mr.
justice
fortas,
where
you
have
the
element
of
truth,
truth
thereby
makes
it
news.
and
news
therefore
brings
us
in
the
first
amendment
problems.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
that
would
be
my
answer
to
the
question.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
that
would
be
my
conclusion.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
chief
justice,
cruel
as
it
might
be
in
special
circumstances
as
it
was
in
the
sidis
case
and
in
other
area,
i
believe
that
that
would
not
be
a
violation
under
new
york
law.
it
is
required
under
new
york
law
that
there'd
be
fictionalization
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
which
means
that
there'd
be
a
conscious
staging
in
a
fictionalized
context.
and
in
the
case
that
you've
presented,
the
article
would
have
had
the
qualifying
phrase
indicating
that
there
was
a
relationship,
let
me
point
out
that
in
the
first
draft
of
the
article
that
mr.
prideaux
wrote,
it
was
not
about
as
far
as
his
major
theme
is
concerned
“the
hills”
which
was
the
article
you
see
before
you.
it
was
about
the
play.
it
didn't
have
the
hills
in
the
text
of
the
article
although
it
had
it
in
some
of
the
pictures.
and
it
also
had
in
the
first
draft
of
the
article
the
terms
somewhat
fictionalized,
was
written
into
the
first
part
of
the
article.
it
happens
that
when
the
checker
went
over
the
article
as
in
life's
very,
very
careful
checking
of
the
facts
that
question
marks
were
put
over
the
phrase,
“somewhat
fictionalized”
and
this
brings
us
back
to
the
question
of
intent,
what
happened
when
that
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
not
only
mr.
prideaux
but
of
his
editor
of
media,
(inaudible),
mr.
kassner.
did
they
check
with
the
hills?
no.
did
they
check
with
the
author?
what
they
did
was
to
strike
out
the
word
“somewhat
fictionalized”,
rewrite
the
whole
article,
changed
the
running
head
of
the
article
so
that
it
--
instead
of
being
desperate
hours
about
the
play,
true
crime
about
the
hill's.
in
other
words,
they
went
to
the
very
last
limit
to
identify
that
play
with
the
hill's
and
the
true
incident
which
certainly
bears
on
the
point
that
this
was
a
fictionalized
account
and
that
there
was
certainly
knowledge
and
at
the
very
least,
reckless
disregard
of
the
facts.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
if
i
understand
the
chief
justice's
question,
it
is
that
--
let's
suppose
we
had
a
situation
where
liability
were
found
in
the
case
that
you
present,
would
that
involve
constitutional
rights?
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
it
would.
i'm
referring
now
not
to
the
new
york
cases.
i'm
referring
to
this
whole
field
of
privacy
which
will
be
before
this
court,
i
am
sure
in
times
in
the
future.
but
what
we
have
here
is
the
problem
of
all
publishers,
not
publishers
just
like
time
or
life
with
huge
staffs
and
research
staffs
but
we
have
publishers
that
do
not
have
the
facilities
to
check
stories
as
much
as
others.
and
i
believe
that
if
the
lines
are
drawn
too
tightly
that
you
would
have
a
serious
restriction
on
freedom
of
expression.
i
think
the
reason
that
the
new
york
statute
does
not
present
a
first
amendment
problem
is
because
it
has
been
so
narrowly
constructed.
and
i
believe
the
very
fact
that
it
is
denied
recovery
in
cases
like
sidis
and
would
deny
recovery
in
the
case
of
the
chief
justice's
point.
i
believe
that
this
answers
the
fundamental
question
that
has
been
raised
by
appellant
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
this
case
does
violate
first
amendment
considerations.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
melvin
versus
reid?
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
as
the
chief
justice
would
know
when
an
individual
prepares
a
case,
he
concentrates
on
his
own
law
and
his
own
case.
looking
at
melvin
versus
reid,
recognizing
that
first
in
california,
this
was
a
common
law
decision.
there
was
no
statute
in
california.
and
incidentally,
there
are
some
other
jurisdictions
where
true
cases
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i
think
its
common
law
jurisdiction.
that's
my
req
--
pardon
me,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
under
the
california
code.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
but
i
would
say
that
the
--
as
far
as
this
--
the
california
is
concerned,
if
i
could
digress
for
a
moment,
the
california
courts
recognized
the
“right
of
privacy”
under
a
phrase
in
the
california
constitution
providing
for
the
pursuit
of
happiness
which
it
seems
to
me
is
a
fundamentally
a
sound
proposition.
but
let's
get
to
the
point.
melvin
versus
reid,
a
reformed
prostitute,
a
motion
picture
years
later
after
she
has
established
a
place
in
the
community
dredging
up
all
the
facts
through
question,
does
it
present
a
constitutional
problem?
and
i
would
say
here,
if
i
maybe
so
bold
that
i
believe
that
this
came
before
this
court,
this
court
would
have
to
apply
the
--
an
ad
hoc
balancing
test.
i
recognized
at
this
point
whether
that
test
is
still
valid
after
recent
decisions
remains
to
be
seen.
but
certainly,
you
would
have
to
balance
in
this
case
the
community
interest
in
rehabilitating
the
reformed
prostitute
against
the
first
amendment
considerations
involved
in
giving
to
newspapers
and
television,
a
right
to
publish
things
that
maybe
interesting
and
newsworthy.
this
is
the
problem
that
would
be
presented.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
there
--
mr.
justice
brennan
is
absolutely
correct.
there
were
aspects
of
fictionalization
but
they
were,
if
i
may
use
mr.
medina's
term,
superficial.
they
didn't
go
to
the
heart
of
the
case.
the
heart
of
the
case
was
substantially
accurate
insofar
as
the
report
is
concerned.
could
i
say
one
other
thing
with
regard
to
life
magazine's
position
here?
i
want
to
set
the
record
straight
at
one
point.
the
appellant
in
his
reply
brief
points
out
that
we
as
representing
the
plaintiff
obviously
don't
like
life's
style.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
that
isn't
the
issue
in
this
case.
i
happened
to
like
life
magazine
and
even
if
i
didn't,
the
fact
that
it
is
the
most
popular
picture
magazine
in
the
nation
indicates
that
they
must
be
doing
something
right.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
but
on
the
other
point
that
i
would
make,
the
key
point
here
is
not
life's
style,
the
point
here
is,
why
is
life
the
most
popular
picture
magazine.
two
reasons,
one
because
it's
newsy.
it
takes
last
week's
news
and
makes
it
interesting
so
it
has
that
problem.
but
two,
why
is
it
as
the
most
quoted
yet
in
time
of
all
the
weekly
news
magazine,
because
it's
accurate,
because
people
can
rely
on
it
because
it's
true.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
that's
what's
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
mr.
justice
fortas,
under
life's
–
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
procedure
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
oh,
under
--
that
the
answer
is
they
had
checked
it
to
this
extent.
under
life's
procedure,
a
researcher
has
the
responsibility
to
read
the
article
and
to
check
each
word
in
the
article
indicating
that
she
has
checked
its
accuracy.
in
this
instance,
each
word
in
the
first
draft
of
this
article
had
been
--
a
checkmark
had
been
placed
over
each
word
but
over
the
words
“somewhat
fictionalized”,
question
marks
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
well,
it
was
carefully
checked
except
for
what
is
the
heart
of
this
case
somewhat
fictionalized
and
on
that
it
was
not
carefully
checked.
in
fact,
life
was
put
on
notice
by
the
fact
that
its
researcher
indicated
there
was
somewhat
fictionalized
that
that
ought
to
be
checked
and
then
they
failed
to
make
any
check
at
all.
they
proceeded
to
go
even
further
in
the
direction
that
the
researcher
indicated
they
should
not
go.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
page
306,
mr.
justice
black.
would
you
like
me
to
read
portions
of
it?
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
fine.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
it's
all
there
and
all
the
--
i
think
mr.
medina
would
agree,
the
whole
--
all
of
that
charges
is
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
292.
i
was
reading
from
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
page
292
and
following.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
just
to
the
charge
your
honor
is
on
page
307
because
that
portion
was
repeated
no
less
than
six
different
times
and
that's
the
heart
of
the
charge
right
there.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
complete
charge
is
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
which
is
on
page
307.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i
also
should
say
that
there's
additional
punitive
damage
charge
which
comes
at
page
565
and
566
which
was
added
later.
and
may
i
say
on
the
punitive
damage
charge,
appellant
in
his
brief
quotes
that
charge
but
it
--
but
i
should
and
i
--
only
because
that
my
inadvertence
was
left
off
of
the
quote.
appellant
points
out
that
--
in
its
quote
that
this
was
done
knowingly
or
through
failure
to
make
a
reasonable
investigation
but
the
balance
of
the
charge
or
the
punitive
damage
charge,
is
you
do
not
need
to
find
that
there
was
any
actual
ill
will
or
personal
malice
toward
the
plaintiffs
if
you
find
a
reckless
or
wanton
disregard
of
the
plaintiff's
rights.
my
point
being
is
that
the
punitive
damage
charge
was
not
based
simply
on
failure
to
make
a
reasonable
investigation.
there
it
--
there
had
to
be
the
failure
to
make
a
reasonable
investigation
and
a
reckless
or
wanton
disregard
to
the
plaintiff's
rights
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
which
again
gets
us
within
the
test
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
it
did.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
is
--
there
was
a
finding,
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
jury
found
for
the
plaintiff
after
hearing
that
charge,
it
is
my
position
that
there
was
a
reckless
disregard
of
the
plaintiffs'
rights.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
reckless
and
wanton
disregard
of
plaintiffs
right
and
that
no
reasonable
investigation
had
been
made,
yes.
does
that
answer
the
question?
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
you
have
picked
up
on
a
fundamental
point.
i
would
say
further,
what
we
have
here
before
this
court
as
a
matter
of
first
impression
is
the
use
of
falsity
to
invade
privacy
for
purposes
of
profit
and
as
compared
with
the
use
of
falsity
to
damage
reputation.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
that
is
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
new
york
law
of
privacy
mr.
justice
white
is
a
very
limited
law.
the
recoveries
for
privacy
in
new
york
under
this
statute
are
far
more
limited
than
as
the
case
in
most
that
the
jurisdictions
including
our
state
of
california.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
fundamental
point
that
has
been
made
by
appellant
and
which
must
be
considered
by
this
court
that
vagueness
is
answered
by
what
has
happened
over
60
years.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
limiting
construction.
limiting
for
example
in
--
including
in
matters
that
are
news
or
comic
strips,
a
comic
strip
portrayal
of
the
man
who
was
a
hero
and
the
plane
flew
into
the
empire
state
building,
no
liability
because
a
comic
strip
was
considered
to
be
--
since
it
was
true
even
though
it
was
sensational.
it
isn't
sensationalism
alone
here.
what
is
involved
is
fictionalization
for
the
purpose
of
profit.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
we've
come
far
afield
from
the
first
time
that
we
argued
this
case
this
spring.
then
the
question
before
the
court
was
whether
or
not
the
judgment
in
this
case
impinged
on
the
first
amendment.
now,
we
have
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
the
judgment
in
all
of
the
new
york
cases
going
back
over
63
years
may
have
impinged
upon
the
first
amendment.
i
am
not
going
to
make
a
point
of
arguing
the
standing
question
because
i
believe
that
not
only
this
judgment
but
the
interpretations
of
the
court
of
new
york
of
this
statute
over
63
years
can
be
sustained
as
on
first
amendment
grounds.
but
to
bring
the
whole
matter
into
context,
i
think
it
is
vitally
important
to
see
first
and
to
come
back
to
the
case
that
this
court
must
decide
in
this
proceeding.
now,
counsel
for
the
appellant
has
stated
here
as
he
stated
previously
that
this
account
was
basically
true.
his
backup
position
to
that
is
that
if
there
was
falsehood,
it
was
at
most
negligent
falsehood.
he
also
contends
that
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned
as
applied
in
this
case,
that
law
did
not
require
proof
of
intentional
falsehood.
it
is
our
contention
that
in
this
case,
it
was
argued
by
the
plaintiff,
it
was
established
by
the
evidence,
it
was
charged
by
the
court,
it
was
found
by
the
jury
and
it
was
held
by
the
courts
of
new
york
in
their
appeals
courts
that
life
magazine
lied.
and
that
life
magazine
knew
that
it
lied.
that
is
the
proposition
that
i
contend
for
here.
now,
let
us
look
at
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
they
did.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
in
the
case
of
this
--
presented
before
the
court,
life
magazine
by
what
i
would
call
the
device
of
a
--
of
a
verbal
picture.
life
magazine
presented
to
its
millions
of
readers
the
proposition
that
the
hill
incident
was
the
same
as
the
desperate
hours
play.
now,
that
was
not
true.
we
argued
that
proposition
previously
in
the
spring
but
the
best
and
most
eloquent
proof
that
it
was
not
true
is
that
life
tells
its
pictures
not
only
by
its
words
but
primarily
by
its
pictures.
and
in
telling
its
story
by
pictures,
the
six
pictures
that
it
selects
on
this
play
presents
incidents
none
of
which
occurred
to
the
hills,
all
of
which,
of
course,
had
happened
in
the
play.
this
was
not
simply
incidental
falsity,
it
was
substantial
falsity
and
it
was
complete
falsity
on
every
one
of
those
incidents.
now,
the
contention
is
made
by
the
appellant
that
the
only
error
involved
here
was
the
use
of
the
word
“reenacted”,
and
that
that
was
at
best
negligence.
but
appellant
had
to
use
the
word
“reenacted”
by
reason
of
what
it
had
done
in
terms
of
the
presentation
of
the
photographic
story
because
if
it
had
said
what
was
the
truth
that
the
hill
incident
was
one
of
several
hostage
instances
about
which
the
author
had
read,
and
that
it
was
reminiscent
of
this
incident,
this
would
not
have
been
editorially
in
keeping
with
the
picture
story
which
life
presented
to
its
readers.
the
second
proposition
is
that
not
only
did
life
make
this
false
statement,
but
that
its
editors
and
in
this
case,
its
picture
editor,
made
the
statement
with
knowledge
that
it
was
false,
what
information
did
he
have
before
him.
and
here,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
like
to
distinguish
the
information
that
was
available
to
life
magazine
from
the
information
that
was
available
to
the
new
york
times
in
the
case
of
new
york
times
versus
sullivan.
in
that
case,
there
was
information
in
the
times'
general
files,
as
you
pointed
out
in
your
opinion,
which
proved
the
falsity
of
some
of
the
materials
in
the
ad.
in
that
case,
the
new
york
times
was
printing
a
--
an
ad
which
had
been
submitted
to
them
by
others
rather
than
printing
what
was
in
effect
a
statement
that
had
been
authored
by
the
new
york
times
staff
itself.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
story
that
was
originated
by
the
defendant,
and
we
have
the
truth
about
this
story,
not
in
the
general
files
of
the
defendant,
but
in
the
story
files
of
the
defendant.
and
in
the
story
file
of
the
defendant,
there
were
not
only
the
current
statements
and
stories
that
have
been
carried
at
the
time
the
hill
incident
occurred
but
there
was
an
article
by
the
author
himself
in
which
he
specifically
stated
that
his
play
was
not
based
on
any
specific
incident
but
was
based
on
many
instances
incur
--
occurring
in
several
different
cities
and
that
when
he
had
completed
his
story,
it
was
different
from
any
of
the
hostage
instances
about
which
he
had
read.
the
defendant's
editor
prideaux
was
questioned
on
that
point.
in
his
testimony,
he
agreed
that
he
had
that
story
in
his
possession
and
that
he
had
read
it
and
in
its
brief
in
the
appellate
court,
the
appellant
indicated
and
conceded
that
the
defendant
--
witness
prideaux
had
read
this
story.
and
so
we
have
first,
falsity,
second,
knowledge
of
falsity
and
then
third,
how
did
the
defendant,
with
knowledge
of
this
falsity,
proceed
to
use
the
facts.
let
us
now
understand
another
point.
in
the
63
years
of
the
history
of
this
statute,
there
has
never
been
an
instance
of
an
application
of
a
privacy
finding,
the
finding
of
liability
with
regard
to
a
current
news
story.
in
this
entire
63-year
period,
these
stories
have
always
involved
either
magazines
with
lead
times,
like
life
magazine,
or
television
or
motion
picture
stories.
all
of
which
involve
creation
and
time
for
creation
rather
than
the
kind
of
misstatement
that
may
occur,
for
example,
as
was
mentioned
in
new
york
times
in
the
heat
of
debate
or
because
of
having
to
meet
a
deadline.
let's
look
at
the
life
magazine
story.
that
story
had
a
lead
time
of
three
months.
during
that
three-month
period,
the
appellant's
editors
had
the
opportunity
to
question
the
hills
as
to
whether
the
story
was
true,
they
did
not.
to
ask
the
author
as
to
whether
the
story
was
a
reenactment,
they
did
not.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
author
did
go
with
them
to
make
the
picture.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
he
did.
but
they
did
not
question
the
author.
and
the
author
in
his
testimony
in
this
trial
made
it
clear
that
that
question
had
not
been
asked
to
him
and
that
he
had
not
told
them
that
it
was
a
reenactment
of
that
story.
they
not
only
did
not
do
that,
but
in
the
light
of
the
testimony
that
they
had
and
the
evidence
that
they
had
in
their
own
files,
they
nevertheless
then
proceeded
to
write
a
story
and
in
each
successive
draft,
they
removed
deliberately
every
qualifying
phrase
which
would
indicate
that
the
hill
experience
might
be
different
from
the
desperate
hours.
they
struck
out
the
words
somewhat
fictionalized.
they
struck
out
the
words
that
the
house
in
which
the
pictures
were
made
was
the
hills'
former
home.
they
struck
out
the
word
“former
home”.
they
changed
the
running
head
of
the
article
from
the
story
of
the
play,
the
desperate
hours
to
the
story
of
the
hills
true
crime.
all
of
these
was
done
deliberately,
all
of
this
was
done
with
knowledge
from
evidence
that
they
had
in
their
own
files
that
this
was
not
the
story
of
the
hills
and
that
the
desperate
hours,
as
the
author
himself
had
written,
was
based
on
several
instances.
and
when
he
had
completed
his
story,
it
was
different
from
any
one
of
the
hostage
instances
about
what
she
had
written.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statement
by
the
author
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
first
statement,
i
have
it
here
in
front
of
me.
this
--
the
novel
and
the
play
were
based
on
various
news
stories
in
california,
in
new
york
state,
in
detroit,
in
philadelphia.
this
was
what
was
in
the
files
to
which
i
have
been
referring.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
he
mentions
four.
the
novel
--
i'm
--
i'm
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
what
i
am
referring
to,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
either
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
and
what
i
am
referring
to,
mr.
justice
black,
is
to
the
knowledge
of
the
defendant,
time,
and
what
the
--
the
defendant,
time,
had
knowledge
of
was
this
article
which
had
appeared
in
the
new
york
times
news
magazine
written
by
the
author,
and
this
is
what
that
or
this
reads.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i
recall
no
testimony,
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
appellant
has
any
testimony
to
that
effect.
in
fact,
the
only
testimony
that
we
have
here
is
what
the
appellant
had
in
its
files
and
this
of
course
bears
on
the
question
of
knowledge
and
on
the
question
of
intent.
it
says
in
california,
in
new
york
state,
in
detroit
and
in
philadelphia
frightened
and
dangerous
men
entered
houses.
instead
of
researching
any
of
the
specific
cases,
however,
i
found
it
best
to
let
my
imagination
play
with
the
idea.
in
the
end,
even
the
plot
itself
became
something
quite
distinct
from
all
of
the
other
hostage
instances
i
had
ever
encountered.
that
was
the
statement
that
the
author
of
the
play
had
made
and
that
was
the
statement
which
life
magazine
headed
its
files
and
which
mr.
prideaux,
its
picture
editor,
testified
that
he
had
read.
and
it
is
on
that
particular
statement
that
i
make
the
charge
here
that
not
only
did
life
misstate
the
facts,
make
up
all
statements
but
have
had
knowledge
when
it
made
that
statement
that
it
was
false.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
far
as
the
application
of
the
new
york
statute
is
concerned,
it
is
limited
to
intentionally
false
statements.
now,
on
that
score,
i
think
it
is
important
to
refer
to
the
charge
and
to
point
out
that
mr.
medina
did
not
read
that
portion
of
the
charge
which
refers
to
the
point
that
mr.
justice
white
had
made
a
moment
ago.
the
charge
over
and
over
again
uses
the
term
“alter
and
change
the
true
facts”.
it
is
for
you
to
determine
whether
in
publishing
the
article,
the
defendant,
time
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
altered
or
changed
--
yes,
sir,
on
page
300
of
the
charge
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
of
the
record.
it
is
for
you
to
determine
whether
in
publishing
the
article,
the
defendant,
time,
inc.,
altered
or
changed
the
true
facts
concerning
plaintiffs'
relationship
to
the
desperate
hours
so
that
the
article
as
published
constituted
substantially
fiction
or
a
fictionalized
version
for
trade
purposes.
and
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
white,
alter
and
change
connotes
deliberate
action
to
say
deliberately
altered
and
changed
in
my
opinion
would
be
redundant.
and
particularly
to
say
deliberately
altered
and
changed
in
the
light
of
the
record
in
this
case
because
there
are
87
pages
of
testimony
of
the
cross-examination
of
prideaux
in
this
case
which
go
into
his
reasons
for
making
the
changes
in
the
article
for
his
reasons
for
striking
out
the
words
“fictionalized”,
somewhat
fictionalized
which
also
go
into
the
knowledge
that
he
had
when
he
made
these
statements.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i
think
if
you
read
the
charge
on
punitive
damages,
that
it
requires
not
only
what
--
what
you
have
referred
to
as
just
negligence
but
it
does
require
in
effect
reckless
because
if
you
will
turn
to
page
566
of
the
record,
there
are
two
particular
qualifications.
you
may
award
exemplary
damages
if
you
find
from
the
evidence
that
the
defendant
or
defendants
knowingly
refer
to
the
plaintiffs
without
first
obtaining
their
consent
and
falsely
connected
plaintiffs
with
the
desperate
hours
and
that
this
was
done
knowingly
or
through
failure
to
make
a
reasonable
investigation.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
but
then
we
go
on
to
the
rest.
you
do
not
need
to
find
that
there
was
any
actual
ill
will
or
personal
malice
toward
the
plaintiffs
if
you
find
a
reckless
or
want
in
disregard
to
the
plaintiff's
rights.
in
my
view,
both
of
these
conditions
are
necessary
in
order
to
find
punitive
damages
and
the
jury
did
find
that
both
did
exist
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
let
me
also
point
out
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
on
the
contrary
--
well,
i
agree
that
the
charge
might
leave
that
implication.
the
--
the
words
“ill
will”
are
used
here
without
any
reference
to
anything
in
the
record.
the
“ill
will”
was
not
pled.
and
i
believe
that
in
this
particular
instance
that
what
the
court
in
effect
was
saying
to
a
jury
of
layman
that
the
issue
here
is
not
ill
will
in
a
personal
sense
and
incidentally,
ill
will
in
a
personal
sense
is
never
involved
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
in
privacy
cases,
as
it
sometimes
is
in
defamation
cases.
but
the
issue
is
here
is
reckless
or
want
in
disregard
to
the
plaintiffs'
rights.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
in
my
view,
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
that's
right.
let
me
also
point
out
that
as
far
as
the
finding
of
punitive
damage
is
concerned,
it
was
set
aside
by
the
court
not
because
the
court
questioned
the
jury's
finding
but
because
the
court
questioned
the
admission
in
evidence
of
the
motion
picture.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
--
it
is
out
of
the
case
and
no
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
punitive
damages
were
--
no
--
no
punitive
damages
were
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
awarded.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
meant
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
what
you
are
referring
to
is
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
raiben
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
and
the
opinion
as
it
deals
particularly
with
his
declaration
that
even
if
the
item
was
true
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
even
if
the
item
was
not
--
that
was
true,
that
then
there
should
be
a
liability.
well,
let
me
point
out
first
of
all
that
there
has
never
been
a
new
york
case
in
which
there
has
been
a
finding
of
liability
where
a
newsworthy
item
has
been
true.
and
i
would
be
glad
to
answer
your
questions
on
blumenthal
or
any
of
the
other
cases
that
have
been
raised
in
that
respect.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
blumenthal
was
not
newsworthy.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
i
understand
it,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
both
opinions.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
therefore,
both
opinions
are
the
law
of
new
york.
but
opinions
in
new
york
just
like
the
opinions
in
the
supreme
court
not
only
may
make
a
holding
as
to
a
particular
case
but
also
may
have
a
dictum.
this
is
a
dictum
in
this
case.
it
has
not
been
applied
and
as
far
as
the
future
is
concerned,
it
may
not
be
applied.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
would
seem
to
me
that
this
court
could
affirm
the
decision
in
this
case,
on
what
was
found
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
what
this
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
that
this
court
--
and
this
court
could
point
out
what
i
have
just
pointed
out,
that
as
far
as
this
dictum
is
concerned,
that
it
is
--
has
not
been
applied
in
the
state
of
new
york,
and
if
this
court
feels
it
should
not
be
applied,
it
would
not
apply.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
now,
let
me
--
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
let
me
say
that,
as
far
as
the
raiben
dictum
is
concerned,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
find
a
case
to
which
it
would
apply.
if
it
can
be
clearly
demonstrated
that
the
newsworthy
item
is
presented
not
for
the
purpose
of
disseminating
news,
but
rather
for
the
sole
purpose
of
increasing
circulation,
then
the
rationale
for
exemption
from
section
51
no
longer
exist
and
the
exemption
should
not
apply,
if
it
is
for
the
sole
purpose
of
increasing
circulation.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
i
would
say
first,
we're
talking
about
a
hypothetical
case.
it
is
not
the
law
of
new
york,
it
is
not
the
law
of
this
case.
let
me
give
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
and
i
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
i
would
be
glad
to
answer
further
questions
there.
but
let
me
--
let
me
give
a
case
of
--
involving
a
true
state
of
facts.
in
the
previous
argument
here,
mr.
justice
warren
questioned
me
about
the
case
of
melvin
versus
reid
under
the
california
law
which
was
waking
up
long
forgotten
misconduct
somewhat
akin
to
the
old
law
of
criminal
libel.
and
thus,
court
of
california
found
that
there
was
liability
in
that
case.
i
indicated
in
answer
to
the
questions
that
i
did
not
believe
that
the
court
of
new
york
would
find
liability
in
the
case
of
melvin
versus
reid.
there
is
another
case,
a
case
in
missouri,
1942,
barber
versus
time.
the
facts
in
that
case
were
tried
under
a
common
law
jurisdiction.
and
in
that
case,
what
happened
was
that
a
woman,
very
attractive
young
woman
had
contracted
a
disease
in
which
during
the
previous
year,
she
had
eaten
enough
to
feed
a
family
of
10
and
yet
had
lost
25
pounds.
time
magazine,
in
its
medical
section,
ran
a
story
on
this
woman,
a
story
entitled
”starving
glutton”
and
the
--
either
barber,
i
think,
was
the
heading
on
the
picture,
and
it
used
the
picture
of
a
woman
taken
in
the
hospital.
liability
was
found.
punitive
damages
were
not
allowed
because
time
pled
that
it
had
used
the
picture,
taken
it
from
wire
services
and
did
not
have
knowledge
of
what
was
the
fact.
the
fact
was
that
reporters
someway
got
into
the
hospital
room,
asked
the
woman
if
they
could
use
the
story,
she
said,
“no,”
she
did
not
want
it
used.
and
then
her
picture
was
taken
surreptitiously.
the
missouri
court
held
that
there
was
liability
and
then
pointed
out
that
as
far
as
this
particular
case
was
concerned,
it
did
not
believe
that
the
use
of
her
name
and
her
picture
was
necessary
for
discussion
of
this
medical
matter.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
a
case
of
that
type
while
i
doubt
it
would
meet
the
raiben
dictum.
i
would
suggest
that
a
case
of
that
type
would
present
a
very
difficult
problem
for
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
holding
that
the
doctor-patient
relationship,
the
right
of
an
individual
not
to
have
his
physical
disabilities
published
to
the
world
that
that
does
not
involve
a
violation
of
privacy
in
which
a
privacy
statute
or
common
law
holding
could
reach.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
harlan,
i'll
be
glad
to
do
that.
and
preliminary
to
that,
if
it
may
please
the
court,
could
i
respond
to
two
questions
and
elaborate
on
them
that
were
raised
yesterday,
one
by
mr.
justice
black
and
another
that
was
raised
by
mr.
justice
brennan
and
also
incidentally
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
with
regard
to
the
questions
raised
by
mr.
justice
black,
you
will
refer
that
in
my
opening
argument,
i
referred
to
the
article
“fiction
out
of
fact”
which
had
appeared
in
the
new
york
times
magazine
in
which
the
author
of
the
play,
“the
desperate
hours”,
mr.
hayes,
had
stated
that
the
--
that
there
were
four
different
incidents
which
had
inspired
the
play.
and
that
as
far
as
the
final
product
was
concerned
that
it
was
unlike
any
of
the
incidents
about
which
he
had
read.
one
of
those
incidents
was
the
incident
in
philadelphia.
mr.
justice
black
questioned
me
about
what
he
said
was
an
earlier
article
referring
to
two
instances.
the
earlier
article
i
have
before
me
and
i
refer
the
court
to
that
article
which
appears
on
page
427
of
the
record.
that
article
was
not
in
the
file
of
the
defendant.
it
therefore
does
not
bear
on
the
knowledge
that
defendant
had
when
he
wrote
the
play
or
--
or
the
book.
but
the
article
is
significant,
it
seems,
on
the
basic
point
as
to
the
question
as
to
whether
“the
desperate
hours”,
the
--
the
article,
“the
desperate
hours”
--
on
“the
desperate
hours”
in
time
magazine
and
the
book
and
the
play
were
reenactments
of
hill
incidents.
for
example,
if
the
court
will
turn
to
that
page,
it
will
find
that
mr.
hill
refers
to
three
different
instances
which
he
said
caught
his
imagination.
one
was
the
fact
that
he
lived
near
a
correctional
institution
in
danbury,
connecticut.
and
he
wondered,
“what
if
there
were
a
prisonbreak
and
one
or
more
of
these
desperate
men
escape
in
that
direction?”
then
he
said
he
had
read
newspaper
accounts
a
year
before
describing
an
occurrence
in
new
york
state
not
far
away.
in
this
occurrence,
there
was
a
hostage
instances
in
which
there
was
“subsequent
and
inevitable
violence
in
which
a
man
had
stabbed
a
child
to
death.”
and
then
i
quote,
“shortly
after
this,
or
perhaps
a
month
or
two
before,
three
men
escaped
from
a
prison
even
further
away
from
my
secure
and
comfortable
home.
holding
a
family
hostage,
they
hid
there
eating
and
sleeping
and
then
left
without
violence,
without
the
inevitable
bloodshed.”
now,
while
this
article
was
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
related
to
two
hostage
instances
and
the
fact
that
the
defendant
--
i
mean
that
the
--
that
--
well,
that
the
--
mr.
hayes
was
a
defendant.
liability
was
not
found
in
his
case
that
he
lived
near
a
prison
and
referred
to
the
fact
that
he
has
thought
of
the
possibility
of
prison
breaks.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
two
incidents,
that's
correct.
but
the
significant
point
is
that
as
far
as
this
particular
item
is
concerned
that
it
was
an
item
first
that
was
not
in
life's
file.
it,
as
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
as
was
the
other
item
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
but
--
but
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
question,
mr.
justice
black,
is
not
a
question
of
inspiration.
the
question
is
whether
the
life
article
is
false
or
true
in
stating
that
the
hill
incident
was
a
reenactment,
not
only
in
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
terms
of
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
the
one
word
but
in
term
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i
would
--
would
beg
to
qualify
that
by
stating
that
in
answer
to
mr.
--
the
chief
justice's
question
on
reminiscent,
i
was
--
he
--
his
question
was
quite
explicit.
his
question
was,
“in
the
event
that
they
had
used
the
word
‘reminiscent'
and
then
had
described
the
hill
incident
as
it
have
occurred,
would
there
had
been
a
liability?”
and
my
answer
was
no.
but
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
in
this
particular
instance,
they
said
that
the
hill
incident
was
a
reenactment
and
they've
said
it
not
only
by
one
word
but
they've
said
it
by
all
of
the
pictures
including
the
six
pictures.
and
my
point
is
that
those
six
pictures
do
relate
to
what
violence
and
bloodshed.
and
i
come
again
to
the
article
in
the
author's
own
words,
that
as
far
as
the
particular
incident
to
which
he
refers
in
this
particular
article
is
concerned,
that
it
was
distinguished
from
the
incident
in
new
york
because
they
hid
there,
eating
and
sleeping
and
then
left
without
violence
and
without
inevitable
bloodshed.
and
it
has
been
our
argument
and
our
contention
throughout
this
case
that
the
desperate
hours,
the
heart
of
the
desperate
hours,
is
a
story
of
violence
and
bloodshed,
that
the
heart
of
the
hill
incident
was
the
fact
that
it
was
one
that
was
distinguished
by
a
lack
of
violence
and
bloodshed.
and
here,
we
have
it
in
the
author's
own
words.
now,
a
second
point
that
mr.
justice
black
raise,
however,
i
think
also
should
be
commented
upon.
he
referred
quite
properly
to
the
fact
that
mr.
hayes
had
been
present
at
the
time
that
the
pictures
were
taken
in
the
house.
when
those
pictures
were
taken
in
the
house,
however,
it
is
significant
to
note
what
went
on
in
terms
of
whether
the
representatives
of
the
defendant
discussed
with
mr.
hayes
the
basic
question
as
to
whether
the
article
which
was
eventually
to
be
written,
or
at
that
point,
the
desperate
hours
which
--
about
which
pictures
were
to
be
taken,
whether
the
desperate
hours
was
a
reenactment.
and
on
that
score,
i
refer
the
court
to
page
124
of
the
record
to
these
questions.
“very
briefly,
mr.
hayes,
would
you
tell
the
jury
whether
or
not
the
desperate
hours
is
the
story
of
or
reenactment
of
the
life
episode?”
answer,
“it
is
not
a
story
of,
it
is
not
a
reenactment
of
that
episode.”
question,
and
this
is
the
connected
one,
“did
anybody
from
life
magazine
ever
asked
you
whether
it
was?”
answer,
“no,
they
did
not.”
question,
“did
you
ever
tell
anyone
from
life
magazine
that
it
was?”
answer,
“i
did
not.”
“and
you
never
told
anyone
of
life
magazine
about
any
similarities?”
“i
did
not.”
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
now
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
exactly.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
told
prideaux
that
and
prideaux
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
--
exactly.
and
mr.
--
and
as
--
and
further
in
his
testimony,
it
will
be
pointed
out
that
mr.
hayes
in
answer
to
the
questions,
indicated
that
the
reason
that
this
house
was
selected
was
because
the
play
was
opening
in
philadelphia.
and
that
he
could've
used
any
house
in
detroit
or
in
california
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
or
in
new
york
or
in
any
other
one,
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
play
was
opening
in
philadelphia,
sir.
that
was
the
point.
the
play
was
opening
in
philadelphia
not
in
new
york.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
because
that's
where
the
hostage
instance
in
philadelphia
had
occurred.
but
my
point
is
that
the
--
as
far
as
the
selection
of
the
house
was
concerned,
that
it
was
selected
because
the
play
was
opening
in
philadelphia,
and
hill
testified
that
had
the
play
opened
in
another
city
where
a
hostage
instance
had
occurred,
that
he
could've
used
and
he,
of
course,
would
have
been
delighted
in
order
to
get
publicity
for
the
play.
he
would
have
been
--
could
have
used
any
other
house.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i'm
sorry,
hayes.
hayes
would've
been
delighted
to
get
publicity
for
the
play
and
he
would
have
produced,
of
course,
in
the
other
house.
if
i
could
go
further,
the
point
that
is
to
be
made,
however,
is
that
during
this
process,
the
three-month
period
in
which
the
article
was
being
written.
and
during
the
day
in
which
the
pictures
were
being
filmed
at
the
house
in
which
mr.
hayes
was
present,
not
once
did
the
representatives
of
the
defendant
questioned
him
as
to
whether
those
scenes
occurred
in
that
house.
whether
they
had
inserted
in
the
films
and
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
well,
if
they
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
if
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
if
--
if
they
--
the
reason,
sir,
that
they
should
have
questioned
him
is
that
that's
the
heart
of
this
case.
the
heart
of
this
case
is
that
the
violent
episodes
pictured
in
six
pictures
in
life
magazine
did
not
occur
to
the
hills.
and
life
magazine
stated
by
pictures
and
by
word
that
they
did.
and
this
is
the
question
that
life
magazine,
the
defendant
in
this
case
has
not
been
able
to
answer.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
it
has
not
been
able
to
answer
it
because
it
had
knowledge
even
before
they
went
to
the
house,
may
i
say.
it
had
knowledge
that
again,
from
an
article
in
its
file,
in
its
file
which
prideaux,
the
picture
editor
had
read.
they
had
knowledge
that
as
far
as
this
particular
incident
was
concerned,
it
was
one
of
several
that
had
been
read
about
by
mr.
hill
and
that
the
final
product
was
different
from
any
one
of
them.
and
the
point
that
we
are
making
in
this
case
is
that
life
--
that
the
life
article
is
false,
false
in
stating
by
picture,
by
every
editorial
device
with
no
qualification
whatever
that
the
hill
incident
was
reenacted
in
the
desperate
hours.
that
the
desperate
hours
family
is
the
hill
family,
that
the
violence
that
occurred
in
the
desperate
hours,
that
a
father
beating
the
son,
the
violence
in
respect
to
the
murder
of
the
trashman,
the
participation,
for
example,
of
the
father
in
a
plot,
unwillingly,
of
course,
for
the
purpose
of
murdering
the
--
the
deputy
sheriff,
the
wounding
of
a
boyfriend,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
no
boyfriend.
all
of
these
incidents,
all
of
them
which
were
in
the
desperate
hours
and
which
made
it
the
hit
that
it
was,
did
not
occur
to
the
hills.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
was
stating
that
fiction
was
fact,
it
was
more
than
that.
it
was
fictionalizing
the
hills.
it
was
using
the
hills
as
commercial
props
for
the
purpose
of
selling
more
magazines.
it
was
creating
a
story
rather
than
reporting
a
story.
and
that
is
the
heart
of
the
tort
under
the
new
york
law.
if
it
had
stated,
as
mr.
chief
justice
warren
very
precisely
hit
this
point
in
his
question,
if
it
had
stated
that
this
was
reminiscent
of
this
item
and
then
had
described
the
hill
incident
as
it
occurred,
then
life
article
--
life
magazine
would
not
have
been
liable.
but
i
should
also
point
out,
life
magazine
wouldn't
have
had
a
story.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
well,
it
wouldn't
have
had
the
story
because
it
wouldn't
have
been
newsworthy.
that
is
why
the
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
let
us
--
let
us
go
then
--
let
us
go
to
then
why?
why
life
magazine.
and
when
i
refer
to
life
magazine,
i
am
referring
to,
of
course,
an
institution,
24
editors,
senior
editors,
41
other
managing
editors
and
281
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
--
what
might
--
what
i
am
suggesting
is
this,
sir,
that
--
that
i
am
referring
to
anyone
of
the
individuals
who
may
have
worked
on
the
article.
but
in
this
particular
instance,
the
life
magazine,
as
far
as
checking
on
this
item,
did
not
do
so.
and
they
did
not
do
so
because
life
magazine
knew
what
the
truth
was,
and
the
reason
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
any
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
any
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
any
reasonable
man
can't
disagree.
and
i
would
say
that
any
reasonable
man
reading
the
hayes
article,
fiction
out
of
fact,
which
prideaux
did
and
which
stated
specifically
that
the
desperate
hours
was
different
from
any
hostage
incidents.
that
then
--
that
certainly
put
him
on
notice
that
the
desperate
hours
was
not
a
reenactment.
and
certainly,
it
would
indicate
that
the
editors
of
life
should
check
to
see
whether
or
not,
editorial,
they
should
strike
out
the
word
somewhat
fictionalized.
they
should
strike
out
the
words
that
this
was
the
hills'
former
home
and
whether
or
not
they
should
change
the
article
that
read
to
be
the
story
of
the
hills
rather
than
the
story
of
the
play.
in
other
words,
they
had
being
true
crime
rather
than
the
desperate
hours,
understand
this
is
editorial
changing
and
altering
the
facts
substantially
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
article.
and
i
quote
from
life's
own
editorial
stuff,
“more
newsy,
it
was
a
gimmick,
an
editorial
gimmick.”
and
the
question
is,
“are
private
persons
involuntarily
drawn
into
the
vortex
of
a
public
issue?”
as
mr.
--
the
counsel
for
the
appellant
had
indicated,
“are
private
persons
by
this
court
to
be
allowed
in
effect
to
be
used
as
gimmicks
for
commercial
purposes
in
a
falsified
situation,”
in
which
i
would
suggest
here
an
editorial
organization,
“the
larges
in
the
world
with
more
resources
to
question
the
facts
than
any
other
to
be
allowed
to
be
used
here
in
a
fictionalized
situation?”
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
commercial
purpose
i
referred
to
is
decree
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
magazines
are
sold
--
sold
for
profit.
and
for
its
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
not
at
all.
let
me
--
let
me
refer,
sir
--
i
am
also
quite
familiar
with
mr.
justice
black's
--
not
only
his
--
his
various
opinions
but
also
his
dissenting
opinions.
in
brear
versus
alexandria,
that
dissent
which,
i
think,
is
perhaps,
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
use
the
semantics
of
this
particular
case.
well,
not
a
reenactment,
it's
reminiscent.
in
brear
versus
alexandria,
mr.
justice
black,
in
dissenting
from
a
holding
of
this
court
which
held
an
ordinance
to
be
valid
providing
for
regulation
of
--
of
salesmen
for
magazines,
mr.
justice
black
said,
“if
this
had
been
a
case
so
a
salesmen
of
pots
and
pans,
it
would've
been
a
different
situation.”
what
was
he
referring
to
in
my
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
what
i
am
suggesting
here,
though
i'm
using
it
only
by
analogy.
and
i
am
suggesting
here
that
mr.
justice
black
there
was
putting
his
finger
again
on
the
heart
of
this
case
and
the
heart
of
this
law.
what
he
was
saying,
even
though
that
was
a
dissent,
what
he
was
saying
there
was
that
if
the
purpose
was
commercial,
that
is
one
thing.
if
the
purpose
is
to
sell
magazines
with
no
--
and
not
to
sell
pots
and
pans
out
of
something
else,
now,
let's
come
to
this
particular
item.
we
have
here
through
the
selling
of
magazines.
and
the
use
of
the
hills,
reporting
on
the
hills
as
news
to
sell
magazines,
they
can
have
no
objection
to
that
if
they
are
newsworthy.
using
the
hills
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
in
a
news
story.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
oh,
absolutely.
there
is
doubt
about
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
newsworthiness.
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
we
are
going
to
say
--
whether
or
not
we
are
going
to
say
a
fictionalized
account,
a
fictionalized
account
has
a
newsworthy
privilege,
this
is
the
question.
we
talk
about
newsworthy
privilege
in
the
one
sense
and
we're
talking
about
here
whether
a
fictionalized
account
is
entitled
to
that
privilege.
and
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
this
was
a
commercial
use
and
not
a
news
use.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
that
a
commercial
use
under
the
rules
of
this
court
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
they
were
running
a
magazine
for
profit.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
they
were
running
a
magazine
for
profit.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
calculated
falsehood,
whether
it
is
calculated
falsehood
which
injures
reputation
or
calculated
falsehood
which
injures
privacy,
should
not
be
used
for
profit
in
selling
magazines.
that
is
the
heart
of
this
case.
now,
the
other
question
that
i
would
like
to
comment
upon,
if
i
may
refers,
to
a
question,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
--
and
which
presents
also
the
--
a
--
which
are
--
allows
me
to
comment
on
a
colloquy
between
mr.
justice
fortas
and
counsel
for
the
appellant.
it
would
be
more
comfortable
for
a
counsel
in
any
case
to
say
that
his
case
and
all
cases
under
the
law
are
black
and
white,
that
is
not
the
case
here.
and
it
is
not
the
case
in
libel.
i
would
suggest,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
libel
--
the
libel
law
going
back
in
the
--
in
the
common
law
goes
back
be
--
about
--
between
400
and
500
years.
and
still
today,
even
in
this
court,
there
is
the
debate
between
the
definers
and
those
who
believe
there
should
be
a
balancing
test
as
far
as
libel
is
concerned
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
in
his
(inaudible)
lecture.
that
decision
has
not
yet
been
made,
and
this
court
has
other
cases
on
the
question
of
libel
as
to
what
the
rule
should
be.
there
are
gray
areas
in
libel.
there
are
also
gray
areas
in
the
field
of
privacy.
this
field
started
when,
60
years
ago,
in
the
state
of
new
york,
63
years
ago.
what
i
am
saying
here
is
that
here,
there
is
an
interest,
privacy,
like
the
interest
of
reputation
which
is
involved
in
libel
which
a
state
should
have
the
right
to
protect.
there
is,
of
course,
the
interest
of
the
first
amendment.
and
if
this
interest
is
to
be
protected,
it
must
be
consisted
with,
of
course,
the
first
amendment.
that's
the
problem
in
the
libel
case.
that's
the
problem
that
this
court
considered
and
ruled
upon
in
sullivan,
rosenblatt
and
baer,
layne
and
garrison.
it's
also
the
problem
in
this
privacy
case.
now,
there
have
been
statements
made
to
the
effect
that
the
law
in
new
york
clearly
apart
from
its
application
to
this
case,
and
this
is
mr.
justice
brennan's
point,
that
the
law
in
new
york
is
too
uncertain.
it
--
it
leaves
hanging
over,
prospective
publishers
in
the
future
doubt
as
to
what
the
law
is.
and
that
basically
would
raise
a
very
grave
first
amendment
problem.
and
also,
it
leaves
a
question
as
to
whether
the
law
might
be
applied
in
a
future
case
in
an
unconstitutional
way
even
though
this
court
might
find,
and
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
was
applied
constitutionally.
now,
let
me
comment
on
that
briefly.
in
63
years,
the
courts
of
new
york,
in
interpreting
this
statute,
have
recognized
the
newsworthy
privilege.
in
63
years,
there
has
never
been
a
reported
criminal
conviction
under
this
statute.
in
63
years,
there
has
never
been
a
reported
holding
of
liability
for
a
current
news
story.
and
in
63
years,
there
has
never
been
a
case
reported
in
which
liability
was
held
for
a
truthful
account
of
a
newsworthy
item.
now,
let
me
refer
to
the
last
point
which
has
been
questioned.
the
first
two
i
do
not
think
have
been
questioned.
a
truthful
account
of
a
newsworthy
item,
the
leading
case
there
is
the
one
that
mr.
medina
has
mentioned
as
his
leading
case,
the
blumenthal
case.
now,
let's
look
at
mrs.
blumenthal
for
just
a
moment
if
we
may,
not
for
six
seconds
but
for
maybe
two
minutes.
mrs.
blumenthal
goes
back
to
an
era
in
movies.
before,
we
have
the
great
three-hour
features
in
which
it
was
not
necessary
to
have
any
added
inducements
to
bring
people
into
the
motion
picture
theatres.
in
those
days
in
the
early
theatres
in
the
year
--
in
the
early
1930's
as
you
may
recall
when
you
went
to
the
movies.usually,
there
was
a
feature
movie
of
about
an
hour
and
a
half.
then
there
was
a
newsreel,
and
third,
there
was
the
comedy.
now,
what
does
the
new
york
courts
hold
on
this
particular
instance?
in
here,
we
have,
i
think,
an
indication
of
the
precision
and
a
great
care
which
the
new
york
courts
have
exercised
in
applying
the
statute.
you
cannot
read
blumenthal
without
reading
humiston.
humiston
decided
in
1919.
humiston
was
a
newsreel
case.
and
there,
a
lawyer
who
was
the
subject
of
a
newsworthy
item
saw
his
picture
in
front
of
a
movie
theatre
advertising
the
newsreel.
the
courts
held
that
because
it
dealt
with
a
newsworthy
item
that
there
was
no
liability.
that
was
the
newsreel.
now,
we
come
to
blumenthal.
what
is
blumenthal?
blumenthal
was
not
a
travel
log,
it
was
not
a
newsreel.
blumenthal
involved
four
comics
and
the
picture
was
advertised
in
the
theatres
in
this
case
incidentally
has
nick
and
toni
ace
funsters.
four
comics,
two
of
them
played
the
parts
of
guides
and
two,
the
parts
of
school
teachers
who
traveled
for
15
minutes
around
new
york
and
made
comments
about
what
the
passing
scene
showed.
and
for
six
seconds,
they
put
mrs.
blumenthal
on
the
screen.
now,
there
may
be
questions
as
to
whether
comments
were
made
about
mrs.
blumenthal.
counsel
for
the
appellant
suggests
that
they
were
not.
that
is
not
the
heart
of
the
point.
in
a
production,
which
is
not
a
reported
news,
in
other
words,
a
newsreel
or
--
and
cases
of
gautier,
in
a
production,
a
television
production,
which
is
not
showing
the
plaintiff
in
the
particular
capacity
in
which
he
attended
that
particular
event
which
was
involved,
but
in
a
--
what
is
strictly
a
commercial
venture
having
nothing
to
do
with
news,
are
we
going
to
say
that
mrs.
blumenthal
is
to
be
used
as
a
prop
for
commercial
purposes
as
an
extra
without
her
consent?
i
don't
think
so.
and
that
is
what
this
case
has
said
and
i
think
it's
a
good
question.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
and
i
want
to
come
to
that
point
now
because
that
was
the
other
question
that
i
realized
that
mr.
justice
--
that
you
had
asked
--
asked
yesterday.
first,
as
far
as
the
raiben
opinion
is
concerned,
the
raiben
opinion
with
regard
to
this
case
states
this,
“the
difficulty
with
the
position
of
the
defendant,
time,
is
it
portrayed
the
previous
hill
incident
in
a
highly
sensational
manner
and
represented
that
the
play
was
a
true
version
of
that
event.”
it
was
not,
it
was
fictionalized,
the
jury
so
found.
consequently,
it
violated
section
51
of
the
civil
rights
law.
and
so
as
far
as
the
raiben
opinion
is
concerned,
and
as
far
as
the
law
of
this
case
is
concerned,
that
is
what
raiben
says.
now,
he
goes
on
to
a
dictum,
a
dictum
which
as
we
have
agreed,
has
been
adopted
as
the
opinion
of
the
courts
of
new
york.
what
does
the
dictum
state?
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
what
i
read
from
is
in
page
441
of
the
record,
the
raiben
opinion
begins
then
and
it
carries
on
to
page
441
now.
now,
let's
come
to
the
dictum.
the
dictum
says,
in
that
--
if
it
can
be
clearly
demonstrated
that
a
newsworthy
item
is
presented,
not
for
the
purpose
of
disseminating
news
but
rather
for
the
sole
purpose
of
increasing
circulation,
then
the
rationale
for
exemption
no
longer
exist.
and
in
such
circumstances,
the
privilege
to
use
ones
name
should
not
be
granted
even
though
it
should
counter
the
event
be
given,
and
that
is
what
concerns
mr.
justice
brennan.
let
me
point
this
up.
first,
it
is
not
the
law
of
this
case.
it
has
not
been
applied
in
any
new
york
case
in
63
years.
your
question,
of
course,
goes
to
whether
it
might
be
applied
in
some
future
case.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
for
this
court
to
send
back
this
case
in
which
mr.
justice
raiben
specifically
upholds
the
judgment
on
the
right
ground,
assuming
that
we
agree
it
is
the
right
ground
or
a
constitutional
ground.
on
the
basis
of
a
dictum,
i
think
it
certainly
would
not
be
appropriate
because
the
court
has
another
course
of
action.
the
court
can
affirm
this
case
on
its
facts
and
it
can
reject
the
dictum.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
well,
i've
tried
to
make
it
clear.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
same
what
raiben
case.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
raiben,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
(inaudible)
dissent.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
is
my
position,
stated
better
than
i
have.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
fortas,
what
i
--
what
i
say
also
is
that
--
as
i
state
here
is
this
11-year
old
case.
this
is
the
burden,
of
course,
for
the
defendant,
time.
this
11-year
old
case
has
been
a
burden
also
for
this
private
citizen.
and
for
--
after
11
years,
for
this
case
to
be
reversed
not
on
the
facts
of
this
case
but
to
be
reversed
on
a
dictum,
a
dictum
which
this
court
could
specifically
disavow.
it
seems
to
be
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
well,
i
understand.
i
was
only
mentioning
the
fact.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
no,
most
of
their
made
at
the
appellate
division.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
on
privacy?
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir,
in
flores
versus
mosler
safe.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
in
1960
--
it's
--
it's
a
later
opinion,
1964
--
1964
or
1965.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
which
involves
incidentally
an
advertising
use
and
which,
of
course,
is
declared.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
my
state
of
california?
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i'm
proud
to
be
in
california.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
can
i
answer
that?
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
button
and
dombrowski
were
both
new
statutes
in
which
declaratory
judgment
relief
was
requested
and
at
least
in
one
case.
in
neither
button
nor
dombrowski,
did
you
have
a
63-year
history
of
legislative
interpretation
completely
contrary
to
the
dictum.
therefore,
a
chilling
effect,
i
think,
could
be
seen
then.
i
think
that
distinguishes
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i
--
i
don't
want
to
take
mr.
medina's
time.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
could
you
state
the
question
again,
sir?
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
judge's
charge,
it
seems
to
me,
has
to
be
read
in
connection
with
the
record
in
the
case,
the
record
of
testimony.
it
is
based
on
the
record
of
testimony.
and
in
that
connection,
the
judge's
charge
and
--
and
i
turn
briefly
to
it.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
sorry.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
the
heart
of
the
charge,
it
is
for
you
to
determine
whether
in
publishing
the
article,
the
defendant,
time,
altered
or
changed
the
true
facts
concerning
plaintiff's
relationship
to
the
desperate
hours
so
that
the
article
as
published
constituted
fiction.
an
incidental
mistake
in
the
statement
of
a
fact,
the
facts
does
not
render
the
defendant
liable.
before
the
plaintiffs
can
be
entitled
to
a
verdict
against
the
defendant,
you
must
find
that
the
statements
concerning
the
plaintiffs
in
the
article
constituted
fiction.
now,
looking
at
the
record
of
the
case,
the
case
had
been
argued
on
the
basis
of
intentional
fictionalization.
and
in
that
connection,
let
me
quote
from
the
appellees'
closing
argument
to
the
jury.
in
this
case,
the
defendant,
time,
incorporated
is
charged
with
something
of
enormous
gravity.
we
charged
time
with
having
published
a
false
article,
falsely
dragging
the
plaintiffs
into
the
news,
falsely
linking
them
with
the
violent
melodramatic
work
of
fiction
for
commercial
purposes.
we
charge
this
most
powerful
of
all
news
publications
in
the
world
with
having
done
this
deliberately
with
knowledge
of
falsity
and
we
charge
them
with
having
brought
about
the
permanent
disability
of
a
human
being
by
reason
of
their
action.
now,
the
judge's
charge
alter
or
change
the
facts
substantially
in
order
to
create
a
more
interesting
story
for
commercial
purposes
was
what
--
was
the
heart
of
this
case
and
was
what
the
jury
found.
sorry,
sorry.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
the
fundamental
issue
here
cannot
be
determined
unless
there
is
a
judgment
with
regard
to
the
facts.
there
has
been
discussion
to
the
effect
that
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
life
article
is
not
material
and
should
not
raise
a
constitutional
question.
but
if
the
court
would
permit,
i
would
like
to
present
the
facts
as
we
see
them
for
a
moment.
and
in
doing
so,
let
me
read
from
the
reply
brief
of
the
defendant.
the
desperate
hours
in
a
very
fundamental
way
was
the
reenactment
of
the
hill
incident
and
the
life
article
was
accurate
and
substantially
more
accurate
than
it
needed
to
be
to
gain
first
amendment
protection.
and
later
on,
the
differences
are
superficial
differences.
now,
as
my
argument
will
develop,
if
those
statements
or
conclusions
are
correct,
this
decision
by
this
court
of
new
york
should
be
reversed
both
on
constitutional
grounds
and
also,
i
would
say
parenthetically
that
this
case
would
not
qualify
for
liability
under
the
law
of
new
york.
let
us
turn
to
the
facts
for
a
moment.
was
this
a
reenactment?
now
the
court
has
some
primary
documents
which
it
can
examine
to
answer
that
question.
therefore,
one,
the
life
article,
two,
the
play,
three,
the
current
news
accounts
which
are
in
the
record
written
at
the
time
the
play
came
out,
and
four,
an
article
by
the
author
written
at
the
time
the
play
came
out
indicating
his
view
as
to
whether
the
play
was
a
reenactment.
looking
to
the
point
of
whether
the
play
was
a
reenactment
however,
i
think
it
is
fundamentally
necessary
for
us
to
get
away
from
the
superficial
and
i
would
state
that
they
are
those
similarities
or
differences
as
far
as
the
cast
of
characters
in
the
stage
setting
are
concerned.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
or
not
it
happens
that
the
hill
family,
there
were
five
children
and
in
the
fictional
family
there
were
two
children.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
this
incident
may
have
taken
place
in
early
fall
or
late
fall
that
in
the
hill
incident,
it
occurred
in
philadelphia
and
that
in
the
fictional
incident,
it
occurred
in
indianapolis
or
that
the
house
in
the
hill
case
was
a
three-storey
house
and
the
house
in
the
case
of
the
fictional
story
was
a
two-storey
house.
all
of
those
factors
whether
they
are
similarities
or
differences
relate
to
the
cast
of
characters
into
the
stage
setting.
and
as
the
member
of
this
court,
i
think
we'll
agree,
the
cast
of
characters
in
stage
setting
tell
us
no
more
about
a
play
than
a
picture
frame
tells
us
about
a
portrait
or
a
painting.
the
question
with
regard
to
the
portrait
is
what's
on
the
canvass?
and
the
key
question
with
regard
to
the
play,
what
took
place
in
the
play?
what
went
on?
now
on
that
point,
we
have
some
primary
evidence
and
it
comes
directly
from
the
article
itself.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
reading
of
the
life
article
can
lead
to
no
conclusion
except
that
those
individuals
who
go
to
the
play,
playing
at
the
barrymore
theatre
at
that
time
would
see
a
reenactment
of
an
incident
which
happened
to
the
hills.
the
reading
of
the
article
and
of
the
pictures
which
of
course
were
the
heart
of
the
article
would
lead
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i'm
saying
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
life
told
its
readers
that
the
play
was
a
reenactment
of
the
hill
incident
and
that
that
was
the
message
that
life
got
across
and
therefore
the
play
therefore
becomes
quite
material
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
exactly.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
when
we
look
at
the
hill
incident
and
the
play,
we
have
incidents
that
instead
of
being
similar
except
as
--
for
the
cast
of
characters
in
the
stage
settings
are
concerned
are
as
far
apart
as
they
could
possibly
be.
let's
look
at
the
hill
incident
for
a
moment.
what
made
it
a
particularly
unusual
hostage
instance?
what
made
that
particularly
unusual
hostage
incident
was
the
fact
that
it
had
an
absence
of
violence.
as
mrs.
hill
pointed
out,
the
convicts
acted
like
perfect
gentlemen
in
time
magazine
in
a
current
news
report
precociously
said
and
titled
its
account,
house
party
because
a
complete
lack
of
violence.
now
what
made
the
play
a
hit?
it
wasn't
the
fact
that
it
was
just
about
hostage
instances
or
that
because
it
happened
to
relate
to
the
hill
incident
which
it
didn't
but
what
made
the
play
a
hit
was
that
it
took
an
old
theme
as
the
new
york
times
review
pointed
out
which
many
times
have
been
written
about
in
plays
it
as
novels.
and
that
the
author
quoting
again
from
the
new
york
times
review,
melt
the
last
drop
of
horror
from
this
macabre
situation.
so
you
have
the
hill
incident
distinguished
for
the
fact
that
it
lacked
violence
completely
and
you
have
a
play,
a
three-day
reign
of
terror.
but
notice,
he
would
--
life
do
it
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
under
those
circumstances
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
would
be
no
liability
under
the
law
of
new
york.
because
under
the
law
of
new
york,
and
this
was
one
of
the
problem
of
falsity
and
truth
is
very
apart.
under
the
law
of
new
york,
the
test
of
whether
an
article
is
for
purposes
of
trade
depends
upon
fictionalization.
if
it
is
a
true
account
of
a
newsworthy
event
then
even
though
it
goes
back
many,
many
years
referring
earlier
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
then
a
true
account
incurs
no
liability.
but
it's
only
when
the
publisher
falsifies,
fictionalizes
the
term
that
is
used
in
the
new
york
cases,
the
relationship
between
a
past
event
and
the
plaintiff
and
falsifies
for
the
purpose
of
--
purposes
of
trade
in
order
of
course
to
make
it
a
more
newsy
salable
article.
it
is
then
only
that
liability
incurs.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
fortas
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
the
statute
states
basically
liability
on
the
basis
of
two
tests.
one,
advertising
which
is
relevantly
clear,
the
use
of
an
ad
even
there,
there
are
exceptions.
but
second,
for
the
purposes
of
trade.
now,
if
for
purposes
of
trades
had
not
been
over
a
period
of
60
years
been
very
narrowly
interpreted
by
the
new
york
statutes
to
include
only
those
instances
where
there
had
been
falsification
amounting
to
fictionalization,
this
statute
i
believe
would
be
subject
to
constitutional
question.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
well,
the
new
york
cases
going
back
over
a
period
of
years
have
held
that
where
there
is
a
true
account,
a
true
account
of
a
past
situation
that
there
is
no
liability,
the
leading
case
in
that
respect
is
the
sidis
case,
a
case
which
involved
actually
a
very
sad
situation.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
a
genius
who
was
newsworthy
at
that
time
giving
instructions
when
he
was
11
years
of
old
to
people
on
higher
mathematics
at
harvard
and
then
with
the
sensitivities
somewhere
in
times
characteristic
of
genius
retreating
into
private
life.
a
quarter
of
a
century
later,
dug
up
with
the
new
yorker
magazine
in
a
story
written
about
it.
the
story
entitled
“april
fool”.
he'd
been
born
in
april
fool's
day.
and
yet
the
new
york
court
in
indication
of
its
concern
for
the
first
amendment
in
this
case
refused
to
hold
the
publications
liable
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
true
account
of
what
had
been
a
newsworthy
event
and
in
which
there
was
still
an
interested
news.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i
would
say
that
as
far
as
the
question
of
liability
is
concerned,
that
question
is
foreclosed
if
i
understand
your
question.
that
question
is
foreclosed
insofar
as
any
report
that
is
true.
on
that
particular
point,
it
is
clear
that
the
new
york
cases
lay
down
a
very
strict
test
that
there
could
be
no
liability
without
fictionalization.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
did.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
not
specifically
except
i
would
say
there
was
a
relationship
to
it
mr.
justice
fortas
in
a
sense.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
true.
but
i
would
say
that
when
you
read
all
of
the
cases
in
new
york
going
back
over
60
years,
it
will
be
found
that
the
new
york
courts
recognized
that
if
for
the
pur
--
if
the
phrase
for
purposes
of
trade
were
interpreted
in
a
broad
sense
to
mean
that
any
time
a
publisher
took
a
newsworthy
item
and
used
it
for
purposes
of
increasing
circulation
that
that
would
be
an
invasion
of
privacy.
the
new
york
courts
recognized
that
that
would
run
into
first
amendment
problems.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
i
think
that
is
--
i
would
say
that
while
that
may
not
have
been
specifically
mentioned
from
a
constitutional
sense
--
point
in
sidis,
i
believe
that
that
was
the
basis
for
the
court's
conclusion
in
sidis.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
may
i
get
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
my
view,
where
we
have
in
this
new
field
of
the
law
which
this
court
has
not
yet
spoken.
where
we
have
a
situation
of
a
newsworthy
event
even
though
there
has
been
a
passage
of
time
and
then
a
state
attempting
to
protect
the
“right
of
privacy”,
i
believe
that
you
would
run
into
a
very
difficult
constitutional
question
in
the
event
that
liability
incurred
when
the
account
was
truthful.
i
believe
that
the
new
york
test
which
provides
for
liability
only
if
there's
a
combination
of
three
circumstances,
one,
the
use
of
the
proper
name,
two,
a
fictionalized
account
primary
and
substantial
insofar
as
the
statement
is
concerned
and
three,
fictionalizing
for
the
purposes
of
trade
which
means,
falsehood
for
commercial
purposes.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i've
--
excuse,
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
narrow
finding
in
this
case
in
new
york
and
the
state
of
the
facts
before
the
court
here
today
is
the
use
of
false
statements
to
invade
privacy
for
purposes
of
trade.
and
only
in
the
event
that
it
was
a
fictionalized
account
and
i
go
further,
not
only
must
to
be
fictionalized,
it
must
be
primary,
the
individual
who
sues
must
be
the
primary
subject
to
the
account
and
as
far
as
the
fictionalization
is
concerned,
it
must
impair
the
essential
accuracy
of
the
whole
account.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
brennan
that
is
exactly
the
point.
the
new
york
cases
because
of
their
concern
in
my
point
--
in
my
opinion
and
i
will
agree
with
mr.
justice
fortas,
they
may
not
specifically
have
referred
to
this
in
each
instance
but
because
of
their
concern
for
first
amendment
considerations,
the
new
york
cases
have
said
that
purposes
of
trade
requires
a
fictionalized
account
otherwise
you
would
have
a
situation
where
any
publisher
would
be
liable
for
publishing
news
and
that
would
be
certainly
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
we
get
there
mr.
justice
white
as
to
whether
or
not
in
the
case
there
has
been
fictionalization
there
should
be
the
element
of
malice
in
the
testing
of
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
of
the
sullivan
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
and
new
york
times
case.
i
would
say
that
in
the
--
that
in
this
particular
case
looking
at
the
facts
of
this
case
that
there
was
knowledge
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
there
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
under
new
york
law,
it
would
be
my
view
that
in
the
event
of
lack
of
knowledge,
in
the
event
that
there
was
fictionalization
in
the
sense
of
staging
not
a
current
new
story,
let
me
make
it
clear.
mr.
medina
has
referred
to
several
current
news
stories.
there
is
no
new
york
case
that
has
held
liability
in
60
years
for
a
current
news
story.
in
every
instance
fictionalization
has
required
a
passage
of
time.
it
has
required
stages.
it
required
contrivance.
now
your
case
would
be
one
where
you
had
staging.
there
had
been
a
passage
of
time
that
it
was
a
contrived
situation
but
the
individual
did
it
in
good
faith
believing
that
it
was
correct
and
yet
it
was
false.
in
my
view,
he
would
be
liable
under
the
case
of
new
york
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
but
that
was
not
the
finding
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
new
york
would
impose
liability
in
such
a
case.
i
know
of
new
york
--
i've
known
a
new
york
case
where
that
has
happened.
i
recognize
what
mr.
--
what
the
justice
is
getting
at
but
this
was
a
possibility
for
the
future
but
let
me
make
one
thing
very
clear
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
were
it
to
be
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
legal
standard.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
well
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
let
me
come
back
to
the
fundamental
point.
the
new
york
cases
require
fictionalization.
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
think
of
a
state
of
facts
in
which
there
has
been
a
passage
of
time,
fictionalization
requires
that,
in
which
there
is
staging,
in
which
the
individual
whose
name
is
used
without
his
consent
is
the
primary
subject
and
in
which
the
fictionalization
is
--
impairs
the
essential
accuracy
where
that
could
happen
without
knowledge
and
i
would
say
that
it
would
amount
mr.
justice
white
if
not
to
knowledge
certainly
to
reckless
disregard
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
because
of
the
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
fictionalization
is
a
conscious
act.
fictionalization
under
the
new
york
cases
is
conscious.
you
would
put
a
hypothetical
case
which
i
do
not
think
could
ever
happen
but
my
view
is
that
since
fictionalization
connotes
conscious
knowledge
that
this
means
that
you
would
either
have
conscious
knowledge
or
certainly
at
the
very
least
a
reckless
disregard
of
the
facts
which
you
had
here
in
any
event.
could
i
spend
one
moment
with
regard
to
the
differences
between
this
play
because
the
point
of
fictionalization
becomes
critical.
if
this
play
was
a
reenactment,
a
substantial
reenactment
then
there
is
a
constitutional
problem
here.
now
the
members
of
this
court
know
life
magazine
that
it
tells
its
stories
through
pictures.
and
also
the
members
of
this
court
are
aware
of
the
fact
that
life
magazine
being
the
most
popular
of
the
picture
magazines
does
not
use
pictures
that
relate
superficial
events.
they
go
to
the
heart
of
the
case.
now,
the
court
passed
on
--
in
its
records,
it's
the
first
piece
of
evidence,
it
has
the
life
story.
and
if
you
will
take
your
attention
for
the
moment
to
the
pictures,
there
are
six
which
are
used
in
this
article.
now,
understand
this
is
the
article
about
the
play
which
the
appellant
says
is
a
reenactment
in
which
the
differences
are
superficial.
there
are
six
pictures.
the
picture
in
the
first
page,
two
convicts
in
the
living
room
harangued
the
daughter
while
the
mother,
nancy
coleman
watches
helplessly.
that
didn't
happen
in
the
hill
incident.
go
to
the
second
page
entitled
"true
crime,
three
crises
at
a
backdoor",
and
the
picture
there
at
the
real
house
where
the
family
was
trapped,
the
actress
you've
seen
from
the
play.
here,
daughter
cindy
stalls
off
her
beau
from
entering
the
home.
that
didn't
happen
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
to
the
hills.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
chief
justice,
cindy
stalls
off
her
beau
from
entering
the
home
at
the
real
house.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
now
cindy
is
the
daughter
and
she
stalls
off
her
beau
later
on
her
beau
incidentally
gets
into
the
house
and
is
wounded
in
this
play
which
mr.
medina
has
characterized
as
not
having
any
particularly
ugly
factors.
then
the
next
picture
in
that
page,
a
brave
tried
to
save
the
family
fails
when
the
father
has
to
toss
out
a
gun
because
the
son
is
held
as
hostage.
that
didn't
happen
in
the
hill
incident.
there
were
no
heroics
in
the
part
of
the
son
or
the
father
or
the
daughter
or
any
other
member
of
the
family.
and
then
the
next
picture,
their
(inaudible)
--
first
hope
for
rescue
comes
when
a
trash
collector
chats
with
the
wife
and
senses
something
is
wrong.
he
is
killed
in
the
play
but
his
death
puts
the
police
in
the
trail.
that
didn't
happen
to
the
hills.
no
trash
collector
came
to
the
house,
no
one
was
killed,
not
the
trash
collector,
not
the
two
convicts
who
were
killed
in
the
play
and
no
one
was
wounded
as
was
the
boyfriend.
now,
let's
go
to
the
next
page.
and
here
we
find
robish,
the
brutish
convict.
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
--
there,
it
says,
brutish
convict
(inaudible)
up
the
young
son
ralphie
who
shows
his
fang
by
talking
up
to
the
criminals.
incidentally,
as
we
look
at
that
picture,
you
can
look
at
appellant's
brief
and
note
that
the
violence
was
rather
mild
but
i
submit
that
wrapping
up
is
certainly
can't
be
characterized
as
less
than
violence
and
i
think
less
than
ugly.
and
then
the
next
picture,
daring
daughter
bites
the
hand
of
the
youngest
convict.
that
didn't
happen
in
the
play.
and
then
finally,
and
this
was
the
critical
point
of
the
play,
feverish
father
cleverly
foist
off
unloaded
gun
on
the
leader
paul
newman,
saves
his
son,
saves
the
family,
the
convicts
are
killed
as
a
result
of
this
brilliant
move
in
his
part.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
reason
that
truth
or
falsity
bears
not
only
on
liability
in
new
york
courts
but
bears
on
first
amendment
is
this.
in
the
event
that
there
was
a
newsworthy
event
and
if
life
magazine
had
repub
--
had
published
accurately
even
under
a
stage
situation,
the
relationship
of
the
hills
to
that
event,
i
believe
that
would
raise
a
grave
constitutional
question
because
you
then
get
into
the
point
that
once
you're
in
the
news,
always
in
the
news,
what
the
new
york
courts
have
said
here
however
and
i
think
that
it
is
an
appropriate
distinction
is
that
once
an
individual
is
involuntarily
in
the
news
as
was
the
case
with
the
hill's
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
involuntarily
in
the
news,
as
was
the
case
of
the
hill's,
as
was
brought
out
a
moment
ago.
it's
ridiculous
to
believe
that
he
called
a
press
conference
and
brought
his
little
microphone
out
from
the
house.
mr.
hill
and
his
family,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
in
all
the
evidence
clearly
demonstrates
that
this
is
a
classic
case
of
privacy
not
only
did
they
do
not
seek
publicity,
they
refused
to
go
in
the
ed
sullivan
show.
they
refused
--
mr.
hill
wrote
a
letter
to
one
author
who
wanted
to
write
an
article
and
share
the
proceeds
with
him
and
why?
not
because
they
were
interested
in
the
price
that
they
were
going
to
get
for
privacy
but
because
privacy
to
them
was
priceless.
that
is
why
defendants
attempt
throughout
this
case
to
downgrade
privacy,
downgrade
it
and
to
say
that
invasions
of
privacy
insofar
as
(inaudible)
--
i
mean
false
statements
with
regard
to
privacy
have
a
--
as
i
understand
it
more
value,
social
value
than
false
statements
regarding
defamation
makes
no
sense.
this
it
seems
to
me
is
an
area
of
the
law
which
deserves
a
paramount
measure
of
protection
because
certainly,
it
is
an
area
where
like
belief
as
mr.
emerson
has
pointed
out
in
a
recent
article,
it's
an
area
where
you
have
the
fundamental
problem
that
confronts
all
americans
today
and
that
is
how
does
an
individual
remain
an
individual
in
our
mass
communication
society?
but
i
digressed
if
i
can
come
to
the
--
again
to
the
point.
the
reason
that
the
constitutional
point
is
tied
in
to
the
falsity
is
that
unless
you
have
the
use
of
false
statements
for
commercial
purposes
that
then
you
would
have
a
serious
constitutional
problem.
if
it
was
a
true
account
of
what
the
hills
have
done
even
though
it
did
invade
their
privacy.
in
my
view,
it
would
raise
questions
not
only
in
new
york
where
there
would
be
no
liability
but
it
could
potentially
raise
constitutional
questions.
now,
that
case
is
not
before
this
court
because
the
only
--
there
are
other
cases
and
other
jurisdictions
which
defendant
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
melvin
versus
reid
which
raises
that
very
point.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
current
--
mr.
justice
fortas,
current
news
under
all
the
new
york
cases
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
new
york
statute.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
where
it
is
a
current
news
event,
it
does
fall
it
seems
to
me
under
the
bond
of
the
first
amendment
and
there
is
a
distinction
and
a
very
appropriate
one
that
could
be
made.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
in
this
whole
first
amendment
context
where
this
court
has
been
so
involved
in
the
past
two
to
three
years.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
protecting
individual
rights
whether
it's
in
defamation
or
privacy,
this
new
right
that
is
now
before
this
court
while
at
the
same
time,
having
a
maximum
commitment
to
freedom
of
expression.
now
in
the
event
that
liability
were
imposed
for
a
current
news
story.
for
example,
a
current
review
of
the
play
using
the
hill's
name.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
would
raise
a
serious
first
amendment
problem.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
is
involved
here
in
the
test
of
fictionalization
if
i
may
say
so
is
protecting
the
“right
of
privacy”
but
with
a
maximum
commitment
of
the
first
amendment
by
requiring
that
there
must
be
a
conscious
action
on
the
part
of
the
publisher
in
which
he
falsely
connects
the
individual
with
a
newsworthy
event
where
he
does
harm
through
falsehood.
if
i
could
--
for
mr.
justice
brennan's
benefit
particularly
explore
that
point
one
bit
further.
defendant
has
suggested
as
the
test
for
this
cases
that
where
we
have
any
connection
between
the
person
whose
name
is
used
and
a
past
newsworthy
event
that
that
gives
an
absolute
license
to
lie
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
if
there
is
any
connection
for
example,
that
means
you
could
take
any
hostage
instance
and
write
about
it.
write
about
it
and
say
that
it
related
to
this
particular
play.
i
would
say
that
that
kind
of
a
test
is
one
that,
it
seems
to
me,
meets
no
constitutional
standard
and
i
would
suggest
also
that
it
would
give
a
license
not
to
responsible
publications
like
life
magazine
who
very
seldom
make
mistakes
like
this
but
to
every
(inaudible)
scandal
sheet
in
the
country
to
take
private
persons
or
even
public
persons
who
for
the
moment
had
been
in
the
public
eye
and
then
years
later
because
there
were
some
connection
with
event
fictionalized,
lie
about
them
for
purposes
of
trade.
and
that's
why
we
must
understand
that
life
took
this
argument
and
proceeded
to
say
that
this
was
a
reenactment
of
the
hill
incident.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
is.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
requires
that.
if
i
can
ex
--
go
on
in
that
point
for
one
second
longer,
i
believe
that
the
test
of
fictionalization
as
applied
to
the
tort
of
privacy
is
a
more
appropriate
test
for
privacy
cases
than
the
malice
test
of
new
york
times
and
sullivan
as
applied
to
defamation.
and
i'm
going
to
suggest
something
out
that
may
surprise
the
court.
i
believe
that
the
test
of
fictionalization
as
applied
to
privacy
by
the
new
york
courts
gives
greater
protection
to
freedom
of
the
press
an
expression
than
does
the
malice
test
in
the
new
york
times.
let's
look
at
the
differences
for
fictionalization
and
for
liability
to
be
found,
one,
the
proper
name
must
be
used,
new
york
times,
rosenblatt
and
baer,
you
had
a
problem
with
names.
you
don't
have
that
problem
here.
second,
it
must
be
primary
in
the
article.
that
is
not
a
requirement
in
defamation.
third,
the
defamation
or
i
should
say
the
fault
statements
in
fictionalization
must
affect
the
essential
accuracy
of
the
whole
article,
incidental
inaccuracy
is
enough
in
defamation.
and
fourth,
it
is
necessary
that
the
fictionalization
be
for
purposes
of
trade,
commercial
in
per
--
terms
of
defamation
there
is
no
need
that
the
fictionalization
of
the
fault
statements
were
used
to
serve
the
commercial
purposes
of
the
publisher.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
now
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
black,
the
charge
does
not
put
liability
on
that
narrow
ground
alone.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
charge
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
no,
that
--
that
they
--
what
the
charge
says
is
that
only
if
the
jury
finds
that
one
--
that
these
three
factors
come
together.
one,
the
use
of
a
name
in
a
fictionalized
context
for
purposes
of
trade.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
that
is
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
black,
you
have
put
your
finger
on
the
reason
why
the
new
york
courts
have
insisted
on
providing
for
and
requiring
the
element
of
false
statement
or
fictionalization
because
otherwise
it
is
absolutely
true
that
newspapers
and
magazines
publish
their
articles
for
purposes
of
trade.
but
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
the
purposes
of
trade
test
is
not
met
unless
the
publication
fictionalized
the
plaintiff's
connection
with
the
event.
in
other
words,
where
instead
of
publishing
news
about
the
plaintiff,
it
published
a
fictionalized
account
which
is
very
different
from
news
with
what
were
to
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
not
unless
it
invades
privacy.
not
unless
there's
damage.
not
unless
it
is
primary
and
not
unless
it
is
factually
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
any
publication
does
in
the
general
sense
but
i
should
point
out
that
in
60
years,
the
new
york
courts
had
been
--
have
followed
a
very
narrow
line
of
definition
in
this
particular
field
because
of
their
concern
for
first
amendment
problems.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
exactly.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it's
a
fictionalized
version
for
profit.
let
me
bring
it
back
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
and
mr.
justice
black,
unless
the
new
york
courts
had
been
very
scrupulous
in
insisting
that
there'd
be
any
additional
element
of
fictionalization,
i
would
say
that
this
new
york
statute
would
have
very
great
difficulties
in
the
constitutional
point.
let
me
emphasize
again
that
the
reason
that
life
magazine
did
this
is
i
think
in
the
testimony
where
they
say
one
of
their
researchers,
it
was
a
good
gimmick.
they
were
using
these
people
as
props.
this
was
the
hoax.
they
were
using
them
as
props
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
article
more
readable
and
for
selling
more
magazines.
now
let
me
say,
if
they
stated
the
truth
about
these
people,
that
would
have
been
perfectly
within
their
constitutional
rights
but
when
--
what
they
did
was
to
use
them
in
a
fictionalized
context
for
the
purposes
of
trade
then
certainly
this
does
not
present
a
constitutional
problem.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i
would
say
that
based
on
all
of
the
new
york
cases
and
obviously,
i
must
limit
my
answer
to
those
cases
over
a
period
of
60
years
that
all
of
the
new
york
cases
have
held
that
the
element
of
fictionalization
must
be
present
in
order
to
have
a
violation
under
the
statute
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
because
fictionalization
is
the
essential
element
to
prove
purposes
of
trade.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
where
you
have
the
--
and
so
mr.
justice
fortas,
where
you
have
the
element
of
truth,
truth
thereby
makes
it
news.
and
news
therefore
brings
us
in
the
first
amendment
problems.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
that
would
be
my
answer
to
the
question.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
that
would
be
my
conclusion.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
chief
justice,
cruel
as
it
might
be
in
special
circumstances
as
it
was
in
the
sidis
case
and
in
other
area,
i
believe
that
that
would
not
be
a
violation
under
new
york
law.
it
is
required
under
new
york
law
that
there'd
be
fictionalization
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
which
means
that
there'd
be
a
conscious
staging
in
a
fictionalized
context.
and
in
the
case
that
you've
presented,
the
article
would
have
had
the
qualifying
phrase
indicating
that
there
was
a
relationship,
let
me
point
out
that
in
the
first
draft
of
the
article
that
mr.
prideaux
wrote,
it
was
not
about
as
far
as
his
major
theme
is
concerned
“the
hills”
which
was
the
article
you
see
before
you.
it
was
about
the
play.
it
didn't
have
the
hills
in
the
text
of
the
article
although
it
had
it
in
some
of
the
pictures.
and
it
also
had
in
the
first
draft
of
the
article
the
terms
somewhat
fictionalized,
was
written
into
the
first
part
of
the
article.
it
happens
that
when
the
checker
went
over
the
article
as
in
life's
very,
very
careful
checking
of
the
facts
that
question
marks
were
put
over
the
phrase,
“somewhat
fictionalized”
and
this
brings
us
back
to
the
question
of
intent,
what
happened
when
that
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
not
only
mr.
prideaux
but
of
his
editor
of
media,
(inaudible),
mr.
kassner.
did
they
check
with
the
hills?
no.
did
they
check
with
the
author?
what
they
did
was
to
strike
out
the
word
“somewhat
fictionalized”,
rewrite
the
whole
article,
changed
the
running
head
of
the
article
so
that
it
--
instead
of
being
desperate
hours
about
the
play,
true
crime
about
the
hill's.
in
other
words,
they
went
to
the
very
last
limit
to
identify
that
play
with
the
hill's
and
the
true
incident
which
certainly
bears
on
the
point
that
this
was
a
fictionalized
account
and
that
there
was
certainly
knowledge
and
at
the
very
least,
reckless
disregard
of
the
facts.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
if
i
understand
the
chief
justice's
question,
it
is
that
--
let's
suppose
we
had
a
situation
where
liability
were
found
in
the
case
that
you
present,
would
that
involve
constitutional
rights?
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
it
would.
i'm
referring
now
not
to
the
new
york
cases.
i'm
referring
to
this
whole
field
of
privacy
which
will
be
before
this
court,
i
am
sure
in
times
in
the
future.
but
what
we
have
here
is
the
problem
of
all
publishers,
not
publishers
just
like
time
or
life
with
huge
staffs
and
research
staffs
but
we
have
publishers
that
do
not
have
the
facilities
to
check
stories
as
much
as
others.
and
i
believe
that
if
the
lines
are
drawn
too
tightly
that
you
would
have
a
serious
restriction
on
freedom
of
expression.
i
think
the
reason
that
the
new
york
statute
does
not
present
a
first
amendment
problem
is
because
it
has
been
so
narrowly
constructed.
and
i
believe
the
very
fact
that
it
is
denied
recovery
in
cases
like
sidis
and
would
deny
recovery
in
the
case
of
the
chief
justice's
point.
i
believe
that
this
answers
the
fundamental
question
that
has
been
raised
by
appellant
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
this
case
does
violate
first
amendment
considerations.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
melvin
versus
reid?
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
as
the
chief
justice
would
know
when
an
individual
prepares
a
case,
he
concentrates
on
his
own
law
and
his
own
case.
looking
at
melvin
versus
reid,
recognizing
that
first
in
california,
this
was
a
common
law
decision.
there
was
no
statute
in
california.
and
incidentally,
there
are
some
other
jurisdictions
where
true
cases
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i
think
its
common
law
jurisdiction.
that's
my
req
--
pardon
me,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
under
the
california
code.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
but
i
would
say
that
the
--
as
far
as
this
--
the
california
is
concerned,
if
i
could
digress
for
a
moment,
the
california
courts
recognized
the
“right
of
privacy”
under
a
phrase
in
the
california
constitution
providing
for
the
pursuit
of
happiness
which
it
seems
to
me
is
a
fundamentally
a
sound
proposition.
but
let's
get
to
the
point.
melvin
versus
reid,
a
reformed
prostitute,
a
motion
picture
years
later
after
she
has
established
a
place
in
the
community
dredging
up
all
the
facts
through
question,
does
it
present
a
constitutional
problem?
and
i
would
say
here,
if
i
maybe
so
bold
that
i
believe
that
this
came
before
this
court,
this
court
would
have
to
apply
the
--
an
ad
hoc
balancing
test.
i
recognized
at
this
point
whether
that
test
is
still
valid
after
recent
decisions
remains
to
be
seen.
but
certainly,
you
would
have
to
balance
in
this
case
the
community
interest
in
rehabilitating
the
reformed
prostitute
against
the
first
amendment
considerations
involved
in
giving
to
newspapers
and
television,
a
right
to
publish
things
that
maybe
interesting
and
newsworthy.
this
is
the
problem
that
would
be
presented.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
there
--
mr.
justice
brennan
is
absolutely
correct.
there
were
aspects
of
fictionalization
but
they
were,
if
i
may
use
mr.
medina's
term,
superficial.
they
didn't
go
to
the
heart
of
the
case.
the
heart
of
the
case
was
substantially
accurate
insofar
as
the
report
is
concerned.
could
i
say
one
other
thing
with
regard
to
life
magazine's
position
here?
i
want
to
set
the
record
straight
at
one
point.
the
appellant
in
his
reply
brief
points
out
that
we
as
representing
the
plaintiff
obviously
don't
like
life's
style.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
that
isn't
the
issue
in
this
case.
i
happened
to
like
life
magazine
and
even
if
i
didn't,
the
fact
that
it
is
the
most
popular
picture
magazine
in
the
nation
indicates
that
they
must
be
doing
something
right.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
but
on
the
other
point
that
i
would
make,
the
key
point
here
is
not
life's
style,
the
point
here
is,
why
is
life
the
most
popular
picture
magazine.
two
reasons,
one
because
it's
newsy.
it
takes
last
week's
news
and
makes
it
interesting
so
it
has
that
problem.
but
two,
why
is
it
as
the
most
quoted
yet
in
time
of
all
the
weekly
news
magazine,
because
it's
accurate,
because
people
can
rely
on
it
because
it's
true.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
that's
what's
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
mr.
justice
fortas,
under
life's
–
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
procedure
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
oh,
under
--
that
the
answer
is
they
had
checked
it
to
this
extent.
under
life's
procedure,
a
researcher
has
the
responsibility
to
read
the
article
and
to
check
each
word
in
the
article
indicating
that
she
has
checked
its
accuracy.
in
this
instance,
each
word
in
the
first
draft
of
this
article
had
been
--
a
checkmark
had
been
placed
over
each
word
but
over
the
words
“somewhat
fictionalized”,
question
marks
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
well,
it
was
carefully
checked
except
for
what
is
the
heart
of
this
case
somewhat
fictionalized
and
on
that
it
was
not
carefully
checked.
in
fact,
life
was
put
on
notice
by
the
fact
that
its
researcher
indicated
there
was
somewhat
fictionalized
that
that
ought
to
be
checked
and
then
they
failed
to
make
any
check
at
all.
they
proceeded
to
go
even
further
in
the
direction
that
the
researcher
indicated
they
should
not
go.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
page
306,
mr.
justice
black.
would
you
like
me
to
read
portions
of
it?
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
fine.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
it's
all
there
and
all
the
--
i
think
mr.
medina
would
agree,
the
whole
--
all
of
that
charges
is
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
292.
i
was
reading
from
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
page
292
and
following.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
just
to
the
charge
your
honor
is
on
page
307
because
that
portion
was
repeated
no
less
than
six
different
times
and
that's
the
heart
of
the
charge
right
there.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
complete
charge
is
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
which
is
on
page
307.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i
also
should
say
that
there's
additional
punitive
damage
charge
which
comes
at
page
565
and
566
which
was
added
later.
and
may
i
say
on
the
punitive
damage
charge,
appellant
in
his
brief
quotes
that
charge
but
it
--
but
i
should
and
i
--
only
because
that
my
inadvertence
was
left
off
of
the
quote.
appellant
points
out
that
--
in
its
quote
that
this
was
done
knowingly
or
through
failure
to
make
a
reasonable
investigation
but
the
balance
of
the
charge
or
the
punitive
damage
charge,
is
you
do
not
need
to
find
that
there
was
any
actual
ill
will
or
personal
malice
toward
the
plaintiffs
if
you
find
a
reckless
or
wanton
disregard
of
the
plaintiff's
rights.
my
point
being
is
that
the
punitive
damage
charge
was
not
based
simply
on
failure
to
make
a
reasonable
investigation.
there
it
--
there
had
to
be
the
failure
to
make
a
reasonable
investigation
and
a
reckless
or
wanton
disregard
to
the
plaintiff's
rights
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
which
again
gets
us
within
the
test
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
it
did.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
is
--
there
was
a
finding,
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
jury
found
for
the
plaintiff
after
hearing
that
charge,
it
is
my
position
that
there
was
a
reckless
disregard
of
the
plaintiffs'
rights.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
reckless
and
wanton
disregard
of
plaintiffs
right
and
that
no
reasonable
investigation
had
been
made,
yes.
does
that
answer
the
question?
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
you
have
picked
up
on
a
fundamental
point.
i
would
say
further,
what
we
have
here
before
this
court
as
a
matter
of
first
impression
is
the
use
of
falsity
to
invade
privacy
for
purposes
of
profit
and
as
compared
with
the
use
of
falsity
to
damage
reputation.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
that
is
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
new
york
law
of
privacy
mr.
justice
white
is
a
very
limited
law.
the
recoveries
for
privacy
in
new
york
under
this
statute
are
far
more
limited
than
as
the
case
in
most
that
the
jurisdictions
including
our
state
of
california.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
fundamental
point
that
has
been
made
by
appellant
and
which
must
be
considered
by
this
court
that
vagueness
is
answered
by
what
has
happened
over
60
years.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
limiting
construction.
limiting
for
example
in
--
including
in
matters
that
are
news
or
comic
strips,
a
comic
strip
portrayal
of
the
man
who
was
a
hero
and
the
plane
flew
into
the
empire
state
building,
no
liability
because
a
comic
strip
was
considered
to
be
--
since
it
was
true
even
though
it
was
sensational.
it
isn't
sensationalism
alone
here.
what
is
involved
is
fictionalization
for
the
purpose
of
profit.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
we've
come
far
afield
from
the
first
time
that
we
argued
this
case
this
spring.
then
the
question
before
the
court
was
whether
or
not
the
judgment
in
this
case
impinged
on
the
first
amendment.
now,
we
have
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
the
judgment
in
all
of
the
new
york
cases
going
back
over
63
years
may
have
impinged
upon
the
first
amendment.
i
am
not
going
to
make
a
point
of
arguing
the
standing
question
because
i
believe
that
not
only
this
judgment
but
the
interpretations
of
the
court
of
new
york
of
this
statute
over
63
years
can
be
sustained
as
on
first
amendment
grounds.
but
to
bring
the
whole
matter
into
context,
i
think
it
is
vitally
important
to
see
first
and
to
come
back
to
the
case
that
this
court
must
decide
in
this
proceeding.
now,
counsel
for
the
appellant
has
stated
here
as
he
stated
previously
that
this
account
was
basically
true.
his
backup
position
to
that
is
that
if
there
was
falsehood,
it
was
at
most
negligent
falsehood.
he
also
contends
that
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned
as
applied
in
this
case,
that
law
did
not
require
proof
of
intentional
falsehood.
it
is
our
contention
that
in
this
case,
it
was
argued
by
the
plaintiff,
it
was
established
by
the
evidence,
it
was
charged
by
the
court,
it
was
found
by
the
jury
and
it
was
held
by
the
courts
of
new
york
in
their
appeals
courts
that
life
magazine
lied.
and
that
life
magazine
knew
that
it
lied.
that
is
the
proposition
that
i
contend
for
here.
now,
let
us
look
at
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
they
did.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
in
the
case
of
this
--
presented
before
the
court,
life
magazine
by
what
i
would
call
the
device
of
a
--
of
a
verbal
picture.
life
magazine
presented
to
its
millions
of
readers
the
proposition
that
the
hill
incident
was
the
same
as
the
desperate
hours
play.
now,
that
was
not
true.
we
argued
that
proposition
previously
in
the
spring
but
the
best
and
most
eloquent
proof
that
it
was
not
true
is
that
life
tells
its
pictures
not
only
by
its
words
but
primarily
by
its
pictures.
and
in
telling
its
story
by
pictures,
the
six
pictures
that
it
selects
on
this
play
presents
incidents
none
of
which
occurred
to
the
hills,
all
of
which,
of
course,
had
happened
in
the
play.
this
was
not
simply
incidental
falsity,
it
was
substantial
falsity
and
it
was
complete
falsity
on
every
one
of
those
incidents.
now,
the
contention
is
made
by
the
appellant
that
the
only
error
involved
here
was
the
use
of
the
word
“reenacted”,
and
that
that
was
at
best
negligence.
but
appellant
had
to
use
the
word
“reenacted”
by
reason
of
what
it
had
done
in
terms
of
the
presentation
of
the
photographic
story
because
if
it
had
said
what
was
the
truth
that
the
hill
incident
was
one
of
several
hostage
instances
about
which
the
author
had
read,
and
that
it
was
reminiscent
of
this
incident,
this
would
not
have
been
editorially
in
keeping
with
the
picture
story
which
life
presented
to
its
readers.
the
second
proposition
is
that
not
only
did
life
make
this
false
statement,
but
that
its
editors
and
in
this
case,
its
picture
editor,
made
the
statement
with
knowledge
that
it
was
false,
what
information
did
he
have
before
him.
and
here,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
like
to
distinguish
the
information
that
was
available
to
life
magazine
from
the
information
that
was
available
to
the
new
york
times
in
the
case
of
new
york
times
versus
sullivan.
in
that
case,
there
was
information
in
the
times'
general
files,
as
you
pointed
out
in
your
opinion,
which
proved
the
falsity
of
some
of
the
materials
in
the
ad.
in
that
case,
the
new
york
times
was
printing
a
--
an
ad
which
had
been
submitted
to
them
by
others
rather
than
printing
what
was
in
effect
a
statement
that
had
been
authored
by
the
new
york
times
staff
itself.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
story
that
was
originated
by
the
defendant,
and
we
have
the
truth
about
this
story,
not
in
the
general
files
of
the
defendant,
but
in
the
story
files
of
the
defendant.
and
in
the
story
file
of
the
defendant,
there
were
not
only
the
current
statements
and
stories
that
have
been
carried
at
the
time
the
hill
incident
occurred
but
there
was
an
article
by
the
author
himself
in
which
he
specifically
stated
that
his
play
was
not
based
on
any
specific
incident
but
was
based
on
many
instances
incur
--
occurring
in
several
different
cities
and
that
when
he
had
completed
his
story,
it
was
different
from
any
of
the
hostage
instances
about
which
he
had
read.
the
defendant's
editor
prideaux
was
questioned
on
that
point.
in
his
testimony,
he
agreed
that
he
had
that
story
in
his
possession
and
that
he
had
read
it
and
in
its
brief
in
the
appellate
court,
the
appellant
indicated
and
conceded
that
the
defendant
--
witness
prideaux
had
read
this
story.
and
so
we
have
first,
falsity,
second,
knowledge
of
falsity
and
then
third,
how
did
the
defendant,
with
knowledge
of
this
falsity,
proceed
to
use
the
facts.
let
us
now
understand
another
point.
in
the
63
years
of
the
history
of
this
statute,
there
has
never
been
an
instance
of
an
application
of
a
privacy
finding,
the
finding
of
liability
with
regard
to
a
current
news
story.
in
this
entire
63-year
period,
these
stories
have
always
involved
either
magazines
with
lead
times,
like
life
magazine,
or
television
or
motion
picture
stories.
all
of
which
involve
creation
and
time
for
creation
rather
than
the
kind
of
misstatement
that
may
occur,
for
example,
as
was
mentioned
in
new
york
times
in
the
heat
of
debate
or
because
of
having
to
meet
a
deadline.
let's
look
at
the
life
magazine
story.
that
story
had
a
lead
time
of
three
months.
during
that
three-month
period,
the
appellant's
editors
had
the
opportunity
to
question
the
hills
as
to
whether
the
story
was
true,
they
did
not.
to
ask
the
author
as
to
whether
the
story
was
a
reenactment,
they
did
not.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
author
did
go
with
them
to
make
the
picture.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
he
did.
but
they
did
not
question
the
author.
and
the
author
in
his
testimony
in
this
trial
made
it
clear
that
that
question
had
not
been
asked
to
him
and
that
he
had
not
told
them
that
it
was
a
reenactment
of
that
story.
they
not
only
did
not
do
that,
but
in
the
light
of
the
testimony
that
they
had
and
the
evidence
that
they
had
in
their
own
files,
they
nevertheless
then
proceeded
to
write
a
story
and
in
each
successive
draft,
they
removed
deliberately
every
qualifying
phrase
which
would
indicate
that
the
hill
experience
might
be
different
from
the
desperate
hours.
they
struck
out
the
words
somewhat
fictionalized.
they
struck
out
the
words
that
the
house
in
which
the
pictures
were
made
was
the
hills'
former
home.
they
struck
out
the
word
“former
home”.
they
changed
the
running
head
of
the
article
from
the
story
of
the
play,
the
desperate
hours
to
the
story
of
the
hills
true
crime.
all
of
these
was
done
deliberately,
all
of
this
was
done
with
knowledge
from
evidence
that
they
had
in
their
own
files
that
this
was
not
the
story
of
the
hills
and
that
the
desperate
hours,
as
the
author
himself
had
written,
was
based
on
several
instances.
and
when
he
had
completed
his
story,
it
was
different
from
any
one
of
the
hostage
instances
about
what
she
had
written.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statement
by
the
author
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
first
statement,
i
have
it
here
in
front
of
me.
this
--
the
novel
and
the
play
were
based
on
various
news
stories
in
california,
in
new
york
state,
in
detroit,
in
philadelphia.
this
was
what
was
in
the
files
to
which
i
have
been
referring.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
he
mentions
four.
the
novel
--
i'm
--
i'm
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
what
i
am
referring
to,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
either
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
and
what
i
am
referring
to,
mr.
justice
black,
is
to
the
knowledge
of
the
defendant,
time,
and
what
the
--
the
defendant,
time,
had
knowledge
of
was
this
article
which
had
appeared
in
the
new
york
times
news
magazine
written
by
the
author,
and
this
is
what
that
or
this
reads.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i
recall
no
testimony,
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
appellant
has
any
testimony
to
that
effect.
in
fact,
the
only
testimony
that
we
have
here
is
what
the
appellant
had
in
its
files
and
this
of
course
bears
on
the
question
of
knowledge
and
on
the
question
of
intent.
it
says
in
california,
in
new
york
state,
in
detroit
and
in
philadelphia
frightened
and
dangerous
men
entered
houses.
instead
of
researching
any
of
the
specific
cases,
however,
i
found
it
best
to
let
my
imagination
play
with
the
idea.
in
the
end,
even
the
plot
itself
became
something
quite
distinct
from
all
of
the
other
hostage
instances
i
had
ever
encountered.
that
was
the
statement
that
the
author
of
the
play
had
made
and
that
was
the
statement
which
life
magazine
headed
its
files
and
which
mr.
prideaux,
its
picture
editor,
testified
that
he
had
read.
and
it
is
on
that
particular
statement
that
i
make
the
charge
here
that
not
only
did
life
misstate
the
facts,
make
up
all
statements
but
have
had
knowledge
when
it
made
that
statement
that
it
was
false.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
far
as
the
application
of
the
new
york
statute
is
concerned,
it
is
limited
to
intentionally
false
statements.
now,
on
that
score,
i
think
it
is
important
to
refer
to
the
charge
and
to
point
out
that
mr.
medina
did
not
read
that
portion
of
the
charge
which
refers
to
the
point
that
mr.
justice
white
had
made
a
moment
ago.
the
charge
over
and
over
again
uses
the
term
“alter
and
change
the
true
facts”.
it
is
for
you
to
determine
whether
in
publishing
the
article,
the
defendant,
time
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
altered
or
changed
--
yes,
sir,
on
page
300
of
the
charge
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
of
the
record.
it
is
for
you
to
determine
whether
in
publishing
the
article,
the
defendant,
time,
inc.,
altered
or
changed
the
true
facts
concerning
plaintiffs'
relationship
to
the
desperate
hours
so
that
the
article
as
published
constituted
substantially
fiction
or
a
fictionalized
version
for
trade
purposes.
and
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
white,
alter
and
change
connotes
deliberate
action
to
say
deliberately
altered
and
changed
in
my
opinion
would
be
redundant.
and
particularly
to
say
deliberately
altered
and
changed
in
the
light
of
the
record
in
this
case
because
there
are
87
pages
of
testimony
of
the
cross-examination
of
prideaux
in
this
case
which
go
into
his
reasons
for
making
the
changes
in
the
article
for
his
reasons
for
striking
out
the
words
“fictionalized”,
somewhat
fictionalized
which
also
go
into
the
knowledge
that
he
had
when
he
made
these
statements.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i
think
if
you
read
the
charge
on
punitive
damages,
that
it
requires
not
only
what
--
what
you
have
referred
to
as
just
negligence
but
it
does
require
in
effect
reckless
because
if
you
will
turn
to
page
566
of
the
record,
there
are
two
particular
qualifications.
you
may
award
exemplary
damages
if
you
find
from
the
evidence
that
the
defendant
or
defendants
knowingly
refer
to
the
plaintiffs
without
first
obtaining
their
consent
and
falsely
connected
plaintiffs
with
the
desperate
hours
and
that
this
was
done
knowingly
or
through
failure
to
make
a
reasonable
investigation.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
but
then
we
go
on
to
the
rest.
you
do
not
need
to
find
that
there
was
any
actual
ill
will
or
personal
malice
toward
the
plaintiffs
if
you
find
a
reckless
or
want
in
disregard
to
the
plaintiff's
rights.
in
my
view,
both
of
these
conditions
are
necessary
in
order
to
find
punitive
damages
and
the
jury
did
find
that
both
did
exist
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
let
me
also
point
out
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
on
the
contrary
--
well,
i
agree
that
the
charge
might
leave
that
implication.
the
--
the
words
“ill
will”
are
used
here
without
any
reference
to
anything
in
the
record.
the
“ill
will”
was
not
pled.
and
i
believe
that
in
this
particular
instance
that
what
the
court
in
effect
was
saying
to
a
jury
of
layman
that
the
issue
here
is
not
ill
will
in
a
personal
sense
and
incidentally,
ill
will
in
a
personal
sense
is
never
involved
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
in
privacy
cases,
as
it
sometimes
is
in
defamation
cases.
but
the
issue
is
here
is
reckless
or
want
in
disregard
to
the
plaintiffs'
rights.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
in
my
view,
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
that's
right.
let
me
also
point
out
that
as
far
as
the
finding
of
punitive
damage
is
concerned,
it
was
set
aside
by
the
court
not
because
the
court
questioned
the
jury's
finding
but
because
the
court
questioned
the
admission
in
evidence
of
the
motion
picture.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
--
it
is
out
of
the
case
and
no
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
punitive
damages
were
--
no
--
no
punitive
damages
were
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
awarded.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
meant
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
what
you
are
referring
to
is
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
raiben
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
and
the
opinion
as
it
deals
particularly
with
his
declaration
that
even
if
the
item
was
true
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
even
if
the
item
was
not
--
that
was
true,
that
then
there
should
be
a
liability.
well,
let
me
point
out
first
of
all
that
there
has
never
been
a
new
york
case
in
which
there
has
been
a
finding
of
liability
where
a
newsworthy
item
has
been
true.
and
i
would
be
glad
to
answer
your
questions
on
blumenthal
or
any
of
the
other
cases
that
have
been
raised
in
that
respect.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
blumenthal
was
not
newsworthy.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
brennan,
as
i
understand
it,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
both
opinions.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
therefore,
both
opinions
are
the
law
of
new
york.
but
opinions
in
new
york
just
like
the
opinions
in
the
supreme
court
not
only
may
make
a
holding
as
to
a
particular
case
but
also
may
have
a
dictum.
this
is
a
dictum
in
this
case.
it
has
not
been
applied
and
as
far
as
the
future
is
concerned,
it
may
not
be
applied.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
would
seem
to
me
that
this
court
could
affirm
the
decision
in
this
case,
on
what
was
found
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
what
this
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
that
this
court
--
and
this
court
could
point
out
what
i
have
just
pointed
out,
that
as
far
as
this
dictum
is
concerned,
that
it
is
--
has
not
been
applied
in
the
state
of
new
york,
and
if
this
court
feels
it
should
not
be
applied,
it
would
not
apply.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
now,
let
me
--
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
let
me
say
that,
as
far
as
the
raiben
dictum
is
concerned,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
find
a
case
to
which
it
would
apply.
if
it
can
be
clearly
demonstrated
that
the
newsworthy
item
is
presented
not
for
the
purpose
of
disseminating
news,
but
rather
for
the
sole
purpose
of
increasing
circulation,
then
the
rationale
for
exemption
from
section
51
no
longer
exist
and
the
exemption
should
not
apply,
if
it
is
for
the
sole
purpose
of
increasing
circulation.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
i
would
say
first,
we're
talking
about
a
hypothetical
case.
it
is
not
the
law
of
new
york,
it
is
not
the
law
of
this
case.
let
me
give
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
and
i
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
i
would
be
glad
to
answer
further
questions
there.
but
let
me
--
let
me
give
a
case
of
--
involving
a
true
state
of
facts.
in
the
previous
argument
here,
mr.
justice
warren
questioned
me
about
the
case
of
melvin
versus
reid
under
the
california
law
which
was
waking
up
long
forgotten
misconduct
somewhat
akin
to
the
old
law
of
criminal
libel.
and
thus,
court
of
california
found
that
there
was
liability
in
that
case.
i
indicated
in
answer
to
the
questions
that
i
did
not
believe
that
the
court
of
new
york
would
find
liability
in
the
case
of
melvin
versus
reid.
there
is
another
case,
a
case
in
missouri,
1942,
barber
versus
time.
the
facts
in
that
case
were
tried
under
a
common
law
jurisdiction.
and
in
that
case,
what
happened
was
that
a
woman,
very
attractive
young
woman
had
contracted
a
disease
in
which
during
the
previous
year,
she
had
eaten
enough
to
feed
a
family
of
10
and
yet
had
lost
25
pounds.
time
magazine,
in
its
medical
section,
ran
a
story
on
this
woman,
a
story
entitled
”starving
glutton”
and
the
--
either
barber,
i
think,
was
the
heading
on
the
picture,
and
it
used
the
picture
of
a
woman
taken
in
the
hospital.
liability
was
found.
punitive
damages
were
not
allowed
because
time
pled
that
it
had
used
the
picture,
taken
it
from
wire
services
and
did
not
have
knowledge
of
what
was
the
fact.
the
fact
was
that
reporters
someway
got
into
the
hospital
room,
asked
the
woman
if
they
could
use
the
story,
she
said,
“no,”
she
did
not
want
it
used.
and
then
her
picture
was
taken
surreptitiously.
the
missouri
court
held
that
there
was
liability
and
then
pointed
out
that
as
far
as
this
particular
case
was
concerned,
it
did
not
believe
that
the
use
of
her
name
and
her
picture
was
necessary
for
discussion
of
this
medical
matter.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
a
case
of
that
type
while
i
doubt
it
would
meet
the
raiben
dictum.
i
would
suggest
that
a
case
of
that
type
would
present
a
very
difficult
problem
for
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
holding
that
the
doctor-patient
relationship,
the
right
of
an
individual
not
to
have
his
physical
disabilities
published
to
the
world
that
that
does
not
involve
a
violation
of
privacy
in
which
a
privacy
statute
or
common
law
holding
could
reach.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
harlan,
i'll
be
glad
to
do
that.
and
preliminary
to
that,
if
it
may
please
the
court,
could
i
respond
to
two
questions
and
elaborate
on
them
that
were
raised
yesterday,
one
by
mr.
justice
black
and
another
that
was
raised
by
mr.
justice
brennan
and
also
incidentally
by
mr.
justice
fortas.
with
regard
to
the
questions
raised
by
mr.
justice
black,
you
will
refer
that
in
my
opening
argument,
i
referred
to
the
article
“fiction
out
of
fact”
which
had
appeared
in
the
new
york
times
magazine
in
which
the
author
of
the
play,
“the
desperate
hours”,
mr.
hayes,
had
stated
that
the
--
that
there
were
four
different
incidents
which
had
inspired
the
play.
and
that
as
far
as
the
final
product
was
concerned
that
it
was
unlike
any
of
the
incidents
about
which
he
had
read.
one
of
those
incidents
was
the
incident
in
philadelphia.
mr.
justice
black
questioned
me
about
what
he
said
was
an
earlier
article
referring
to
two
instances.
the
earlier
article
i
have
before
me
and
i
refer
the
court
to
that
article
which
appears
on
page
427
of
the
record.
that
article
was
not
in
the
file
of
the
defendant.
it
therefore
does
not
bear
on
the
knowledge
that
defendant
had
when
he
wrote
the
play
or
--
or
the
book.
but
the
article
is
significant,
it
seems,
on
the
basic
point
as
to
the
question
as
to
whether
“the
desperate
hours”,
the
--
the
article,
“the
desperate
hours”
--
on
“the
desperate
hours”
in
time
magazine
and
the
book
and
the
play
were
reenactments
of
hill
incidents.
for
example,
if
the
court
will
turn
to
that
page,
it
will
find
that
mr.
hill
refers
to
three
different
instances
which
he
said
caught
his
imagination.
one
was
the
fact
that
he
lived
near
a
correctional
institution
in
danbury,
connecticut.
and
he
wondered,
“what
if
there
were
a
prisonbreak
and
one
or
more
of
these
desperate
men
escape
in
that
direction?”
then
he
said
he
had
read
newspaper
accounts
a
year
before
describing
an
occurrence
in
new
york
state
not
far
away.
in
this
occurrence,
there
was
a
hostage
instances
in
which
there
was
“subsequent
and
inevitable
violence
in
which
a
man
had
stabbed
a
child
to
death.”
and
then
i
quote,
“shortly
after
this,
or
perhaps
a
month
or
two
before,
three
men
escaped
from
a
prison
even
further
away
from
my
secure
and
comfortable
home.
holding
a
family
hostage,
they
hid
there
eating
and
sleeping
and
then
left
without
violence,
without
the
inevitable
bloodshed.”
now,
while
this
article
was
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
related
to
two
hostage
instances
and
the
fact
that
the
defendant
--
i
mean
that
the
--
that
--
well,
that
the
--
mr.
hayes
was
a
defendant.
liability
was
not
found
in
his
case
that
he
lived
near
a
prison
and
referred
to
the
fact
that
he
has
thought
of
the
possibility
of
prison
breaks.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
two
incidents,
that's
correct.
but
the
significant
point
is
that
as
far
as
this
particular
item
is
concerned
that
it
was
an
item
first
that
was
not
in
life's
file.
it,
as
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
as
was
the
other
item
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
but
--
but
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
question,
mr.
justice
black,
is
not
a
question
of
inspiration.
the
question
is
whether
the
life
article
is
false
or
true
in
stating
that
the
hill
incident
was
a
reenactment,
not
only
in
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
terms
of
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
the
one
word
but
in
term
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i
would
--
would
beg
to
qualify
that
by
stating
that
in
answer
to
mr.
--
the
chief
justice's
question
on
reminiscent,
i
was
--
he
--
his
question
was
quite
explicit.
his
question
was,
“in
the
event
that
they
had
used
the
word
‘reminiscent'
and
then
had
described
the
hill
incident
as
it
have
occurred,
would
there
had
been
a
liability?”
and
my
answer
was
no.
but
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
in
this
particular
instance,
they
said
that
the
hill
incident
was
a
reenactment
and
they've
said
it
not
only
by
one
word
but
they've
said
it
by
all
of
the
pictures
including
the
six
pictures.
and
my
point
is
that
those
six
pictures
do
relate
to
what
violence
and
bloodshed.
and
i
come
again
to
the
article
in
the
author's
own
words,
that
as
far
as
the
particular
incident
to
which
he
refers
in
this
particular
article
is
concerned,
that
it
was
distinguished
from
the
incident
in
new
york
because
they
hid
there,
eating
and
sleeping
and
then
left
without
violence
and
without
inevitable
bloodshed.
and
it
has
been
our
argument
and
our
contention
throughout
this
case
that
the
desperate
hours,
the
heart
of
the
desperate
hours,
is
a
story
of
violence
and
bloodshed,
that
the
heart
of
the
hill
incident
was
the
fact
that
it
was
one
that
was
distinguished
by
a
lack
of
violence
and
bloodshed.
and
here,
we
have
it
in
the
author's
own
words.
now,
a
second
point
that
mr.
justice
black
raise,
however,
i
think
also
should
be
commented
upon.
he
referred
quite
properly
to
the
fact
that
mr.
hayes
had
been
present
at
the
time
that
the
pictures
were
taken
in
the
house.
when
those
pictures
were
taken
in
the
house,
however,
it
is
significant
to
note
what
went
on
in
terms
of
whether
the
representatives
of
the
defendant
discussed
with
mr.
hayes
the
basic
question
as
to
whether
the
article
which
was
eventually
to
be
written,
or
at
that
point,
the
desperate
hours
which
--
about
which
pictures
were
to
be
taken,
whether
the
desperate
hours
was
a
reenactment.
and
on
that
score,
i
refer
the
court
to
page
124
of
the
record
to
these
questions.
“very
briefly,
mr.
hayes,
would
you
tell
the
jury
whether
or
not
the
desperate
hours
is
the
story
of
or
reenactment
of
the
life
episode?”
answer,
“it
is
not
a
story
of,
it
is
not
a
reenactment
of
that
episode.”
question,
and
this
is
the
connected
one,
“did
anybody
from
life
magazine
ever
asked
you
whether
it
was?”
answer,
“no,
they
did
not.”
question,
“did
you
ever
tell
anyone
from
life
magazine
that
it
was?”
answer,
“i
did
not.”
“and
you
never
told
anyone
of
life
magazine
about
any
similarities?”
“i
did
not.”
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
now
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
exactly.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
told
prideaux
that
and
prideaux
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
--
exactly.
and
mr.
--
and
as
--
and
further
in
his
testimony,
it
will
be
pointed
out
that
mr.
hayes
in
answer
to
the
questions,
indicated
that
the
reason
that
this
house
was
selected
was
because
the
play
was
opening
in
philadelphia.
and
that
he
could've
used
any
house
in
detroit
or
in
california
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
or
in
new
york
or
in
any
other
one,
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
play
was
opening
in
philadelphia,
sir.
that
was
the
point.
the
play
was
opening
in
philadelphia
not
in
new
york.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
because
that's
where
the
hostage
instance
in
philadelphia
had
occurred.
but
my
point
is
that
the
--
as
far
as
the
selection
of
the
house
was
concerned,
that
it
was
selected
because
the
play
was
opening
in
philadelphia,
and
hill
testified
that
had
the
play
opened
in
another
city
where
a
hostage
instance
had
occurred,
that
he
could've
used
and
he,
of
course,
would
have
been
delighted
in
order
to
get
publicity
for
the
play.
he
would
have
been
--
could
have
used
any
other
house.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i'm
sorry,
hayes.
hayes
would've
been
delighted
to
get
publicity
for
the
play
and
he
would
have
produced,
of
course,
in
the
other
house.
if
i
could
go
further,
the
point
that
is
to
be
made,
however,
is
that
during
this
process,
the
three-month
period
in
which
the
article
was
being
written.
and
during
the
day
in
which
the
pictures
were
being
filmed
at
the
house
in
which
mr.
hayes
was
present,
not
once
did
the
representatives
of
the
defendant
questioned
him
as
to
whether
those
scenes
occurred
in
that
house.
whether
they
had
inserted
in
the
films
and
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
well,
if
they
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
if
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
if
--
if
they
--
the
reason,
sir,
that
they
should
have
questioned
him
is
that
that's
the
heart
of
this
case.
the
heart
of
this
case
is
that
the
violent
episodes
pictured
in
six
pictures
in
life
magazine
did
not
occur
to
the
hills.
and
life
magazine
stated
by
pictures
and
by
word
that
they
did.
and
this
is
the
question
that
life
magazine,
the
defendant
in
this
case
has
not
been
able
to
answer.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
it
has
not
been
able
to
answer
it
because
it
had
knowledge
even
before
they
went
to
the
house,
may
i
say.
it
had
knowledge
that
again,
from
an
article
in
its
file,
in
its
file
which
prideaux,
the
picture
editor
had
read.
they
had
knowledge
that
as
far
as
this
particular
incident
was
concerned,
it
was
one
of
several
that
had
been
read
about
by
mr.
hill
and
that
the
final
product
was
different
from
any
one
of
them.
and
the
point
that
we
are
making
in
this
case
is
that
life
--
that
the
life
article
is
false,
false
in
stating
by
picture,
by
every
editorial
device
with
no
qualification
whatever
that
the
hill
incident
was
reenacted
in
the
desperate
hours.
that
the
desperate
hours
family
is
the
hill
family,
that
the
violence
that
occurred
in
the
desperate
hours,
that
a
father
beating
the
son,
the
violence
in
respect
to
the
murder
of
the
trashman,
the
participation,
for
example,
of
the
father
in
a
plot,
unwillingly,
of
course,
for
the
purpose
of
murdering
the
--
the
deputy
sheriff,
the
wounding
of
a
boyfriend,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
no
boyfriend.
all
of
these
incidents,
all
of
them
which
were
in
the
desperate
hours
and
which
made
it
the
hit
that
it
was,
did
not
occur
to
the
hills.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
was
stating
that
fiction
was
fact,
it
was
more
than
that.
it
was
fictionalizing
the
hills.
it
was
using
the
hills
as
commercial
props
for
the
purpose
of
selling
more
magazines.
it
was
creating
a
story
rather
than
reporting
a
story.
and
that
is
the
heart
of
the
tort
under
the
new
york
law.
if
it
had
stated,
as
mr.
chief
justice
warren
very
precisely
hit
this
point
in
his
question,
if
it
had
stated
that
this
was
reminiscent
of
this
item
and
then
had
described
the
hill
incident
as
it
occurred,
then
life
article
--
life
magazine
would
not
have
been
liable.
but
i
should
also
point
out,
life
magazine
wouldn't
have
had
a
story.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
well,
it
wouldn't
have
had
the
story
because
it
wouldn't
have
been
newsworthy.
that
is
why
the
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
let
us
--
let
us
go
then
--
let
us
go
to
then
why?
why
life
magazine.
and
when
i
refer
to
life
magazine,
i
am
referring
to,
of
course,
an
institution,
24
editors,
senior
editors,
41
other
managing
editors
and
281
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
--
what
might
--
what
i
am
suggesting
is
this,
sir,
that
--
that
i
am
referring
to
anyone
of
the
individuals
who
may
have
worked
on
the
article.
but
in
this
particular
instance,
the
life
magazine,
as
far
as
checking
on
this
item,
did
not
do
so.
and
they
did
not
do
so
because
life
magazine
knew
what
the
truth
was,
and
the
reason
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
any
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
any
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
any
reasonable
man
can't
disagree.
and
i
would
say
that
any
reasonable
man
reading
the
hayes
article,
fiction
out
of
fact,
which
prideaux
did
and
which
stated
specifically
that
the
desperate
hours
was
different
from
any
hostage
incidents.
that
then
--
that
certainly
put
him
on
notice
that
the
desperate
hours
was
not
a
reenactment.
and
certainly,
it
would
indicate
that
the
editors
of
life
should
check
to
see
whether
or
not,
editorial,
they
should
strike
out
the
word
somewhat
fictionalized.
they
should
strike
out
the
words
that
this
was
the
hills'
former
home
and
whether
or
not
they
should
change
the
article
that
read
to
be
the
story
of
the
hills
rather
than
the
story
of
the
play.
in
other
words,
they
had
being
true
crime
rather
than
the
desperate
hours,
understand
this
is
editorial
changing
and
altering
the
facts
substantially
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
article.
and
i
quote
from
life's
own
editorial
stuff,
“more
newsy,
it
was
a
gimmick,
an
editorial
gimmick.”
and
the
question
is,
“are
private
persons
involuntarily
drawn
into
the
vortex
of
a
public
issue?”
as
mr.
--
the
counsel
for
the
appellant
had
indicated,
“are
private
persons
by
this
court
to
be
allowed
in
effect
to
be
used
as
gimmicks
for
commercial
purposes
in
a
falsified
situation,”
in
which
i
would
suggest
here
an
editorial
organization,
“the
larges
in
the
world
with
more
resources
to
question
the
facts
than
any
other
to
be
allowed
to
be
used
here
in
a
fictionalized
situation?”
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
the
commercial
purpose
i
referred
to
is
decree
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
magazines
are
sold
--
sold
for
profit.
and
for
its
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
not
at
all.
let
me
--
let
me
refer,
sir
--
i
am
also
quite
familiar
with
mr.
justice
black's
--
not
only
his
--
his
various
opinions
but
also
his
dissenting
opinions.
in
brear
versus
alexandria,
that
dissent
which,
i
think,
is
perhaps,
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
use
the
semantics
of
this
particular
case.
well,
not
a
reenactment,
it's
reminiscent.
in
brear
versus
alexandria,
mr.
justice
black,
in
dissenting
from
a
holding
of
this
court
which
held
an
ordinance
to
be
valid
providing
for
regulation
of
--
of
salesmen
for
magazines,
mr.
justice
black
said,
“if
this
had
been
a
case
so
a
salesmen
of
pots
and
pans,
it
would've
been
a
different
situation.”
what
was
he
referring
to
in
my
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
what
i
am
suggesting
here,
though
i'm
using
it
only
by
analogy.
and
i
am
suggesting
here
that
mr.
justice
black
there
was
putting
his
finger
again
on
the
heart
of
this
case
and
the
heart
of
this
law.
what
he
was
saying,
even
though
that
was
a
dissent,
what
he
was
saying
there
was
that
if
the
purpose
was
commercial,
that
is
one
thing.
if
the
purpose
is
to
sell
magazines
with
no
--
and
not
to
sell
pots
and
pans
out
of
something
else,
now,
let's
come
to
this
particular
item.
we
have
here
through
the
selling
of
magazines.
and
the
use
of
the
hills,
reporting
on
the
hills
as
news
to
sell
magazines,
they
can
have
no
objection
to
that
if
they
are
newsworthy.
using
the
hills
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
in
a
news
story.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
oh,
absolutely.
there
is
doubt
about
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
--
newsworthiness.
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
we
are
going
to
say
--
whether
or
not
we
are
going
to
say
a
fictionalized
account,
a
fictionalized
account
has
a
newsworthy
privilege,
this
is
the
question.
we
talk
about
newsworthy
privilege
in
the
one
sense
and
we're
talking
about
here
whether
a
fictionalized
account
is
entitled
to
that
privilege.
and
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
this
was
a
commercial
use
and
not
a
news
use.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
that
a
commercial
use
under
the
rules
of
this
court
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
they
were
running
a
magazine
for
profit.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
they
were
running
a
magazine
for
profit.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
calculated
falsehood,
whether
it
is
calculated
falsehood
which
injures
reputation
or
calculated
falsehood
which
injures
privacy,
should
not
be
used
for
profit
in
selling
magazines.
that
is
the
heart
of
this
case.
now,
the
other
question
that
i
would
like
to
comment
upon,
if
i
may
refers,
to
a
question,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
--
and
which
presents
also
the
--
a
--
which
are
--
allows
me
to
comment
on
a
colloquy
between
mr.
justice
fortas
and
counsel
for
the
appellant.
it
would
be
more
comfortable
for
a
counsel
in
any
case
to
say
that
his
case
and
all
cases
under
the
law
are
black
and
white,
that
is
not
the
case
here.
and
it
is
not
the
case
in
libel.
i
would
suggest,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
libel
--
the
libel
law
going
back
in
the
--
in
the
common
law
goes
back
be
--
about
--
between
400
and
500
years.
and
still
today,
even
in
this
court,
there
is
the
debate
between
the
definers
and
those
who
believe
there
should
be
a
balancing
test
as
far
as
libel
is
concerned
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
in
his
(inaudible)
lecture.
that
decision
has
not
yet
been
made,
and
this
court
has
other
cases
on
the
question
of
libel
as
to
what
the
rule
should
be.
there
are
gray
areas
in
libel.
there
are
also
gray
areas
in
the
field
of
privacy.
this
field
started
when,
60
years
ago,
in
the
state
of
new
york,
63
years
ago.
what
i
am
saying
here
is
that
here,
there
is
an
interest,
privacy,
like
the
interest
of
reputation
which
is
involved
in
libel
which
a
state
should
have
the
right
to
protect.
there
is,
of
course,
the
interest
of
the
first
amendment.
and
if
this
interest
is
to
be
protected,
it
must
be
consisted
with,
of
course,
the
first
amendment.
that's
the
problem
in
the
libel
case.
that's
the
problem
that
this
court
considered
and
ruled
upon
in
sullivan,
rosenblatt
and
baer,
layne
and
garrison.
it's
also
the
problem
in
this
privacy
case.
now,
there
have
been
statements
made
to
the
effect
that
the
law
in
new
york
clearly
apart
from
its
application
to
this
case,
and
this
is
mr.
justice
brennan's
point,
that
the
law
in
new
york
is
too
uncertain.
it
--
it
leaves
hanging
over,
prospective
publishers
in
the
future
doubt
as
to
what
the
law
is.
and
that
basically
would
raise
a
very
grave
first
amendment
problem.
and
also,
it
leaves
a
question
as
to
whether
the
law
might
be
applied
in
a
future
case
in
an
unconstitutional
way
even
though
this
court
might
find,
and
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
was
applied
constitutionally.
now,
let
me
comment
on
that
briefly.
in
63
years,
the
courts
of
new
york,
in
interpreting
this
statute,
have
recognized
the
newsworthy
privilege.
in
63
years,
there
has
never
been
a
reported
criminal
conviction
under
this
statute.
in
63
years,
there
has
never
been
a
reported
holding
of
liability
for
a
current
news
story.
and
in
63
years,
there
has
never
been
a
case
reported
in
which
liability
was
held
for
a
truthful
account
of
a
newsworthy
item.
now,
let
me
refer
to
the
last
point
which
has
been
questioned.
the
first
two
i
do
not
think
have
been
questioned.
a
truthful
account
of
a
newsworthy
item,
the
leading
case
there
is
the
one
that
mr.
medina
has
mentioned
as
his
leading
case,
the
blumenthal
case.
now,
let's
look
at
mrs.
blumenthal
for
just
a
moment
if
we
may,
not
for
six
seconds
but
for
maybe
two
minutes.
mrs.
blumenthal
goes
back
to
an
era
in
movies.
before,
we
have
the
great
three-hour
features
in
which
it
was
not
necessary
to
have
any
added
inducements
to
bring
people
into
the
motion
picture
theatres.
in
those
days
in
the
early
theatres
in
the
year
--
in
the
early
1930's
as
you
may
recall
when
you
went
to
the
movies.usually,
there
was
a
feature
movie
of
about
an
hour
and
a
half.
then
there
was
a
newsreel,
and
third,
there
was
the
comedy.
now,
what
does
the
new
york
courts
hold
on
this
particular
instance?
in
here,
we
have,
i
think,
an
indication
of
the
precision
and
a
great
care
which
the
new
york
courts
have
exercised
in
applying
the
statute.
you
cannot
read
blumenthal
without
reading
humiston.
humiston
decided
in
1919.
humiston
was
a
newsreel
case.
and
there,
a
lawyer
who
was
the
subject
of
a
newsworthy
item
saw
his
picture
in
front
of
a
movie
theatre
advertising
the
newsreel.
the
courts
held
that
because
it
dealt
with
a
newsworthy
item
that
there
was
no
liability.
that
was
the
newsreel.
now,
we
come
to
blumenthal.
what
is
blumenthal?
blumenthal
was
not
a
travel
log,
it
was
not
a
newsreel.
blumenthal
involved
four
comics
and
the
picture
was
advertised
in
the
theatres
in
this
case
incidentally
has
nick
and
toni
ace
funsters.
four
comics,
two
of
them
played
the
parts
of
guides
and
two,
the
parts
of
school
teachers
who
traveled
for
15
minutes
around
new
york
and
made
comments
about
what
the
passing
scene
showed.
and
for
six
seconds,
they
put
mrs.
blumenthal
on
the
screen.
now,
there
may
be
questions
as
to
whether
comments
were
made
about
mrs.
blumenthal.
counsel
for
the
appellant
suggests
that
they
were
not.
that
is
not
the
heart
of
the
point.
in
a
production,
which
is
not
a
reported
news,
in
other
words,
a
newsreel
or
--
and
cases
of
gautier,
in
a
production,
a
television
production,
which
is
not
showing
the
plaintiff
in
the
particular
capacity
in
which
he
attended
that
particular
event
which
was
involved,
but
in
a
--
what
is
strictly
a
commercial
venture
having
nothing
to
do
with
news,
are
we
going
to
say
that
mrs.
blumenthal
is
to
be
used
as
a
prop
for
commercial
purposes
as
an
extra
without
her
consent?
i
don't
think
so.
and
that
is
what
this
case
has
said
and
i
think
it's
a
good
question.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
and
i
want
to
come
to
that
point
now
because
that
was
the
other
question
that
i
realized
that
mr.
justice
--
that
you
had
asked
--
asked
yesterday.
first,
as
far
as
the
raiben
opinion
is
concerned,
the
raiben
opinion
with
regard
to
this
case
states
this,
“the
difficulty
with
the
position
of
the
defendant,
time,
is
it
portrayed
the
previous
hill
incident
in
a
highly
sensational
manner
and
represented
that
the
play
was
a
true
version
of
that
event.”
it
was
not,
it
was
fictionalized,
the
jury
so
found.
consequently,
it
violated
section
51
of
the
civil
rights
law.
and
so
as
far
as
the
raiben
opinion
is
concerned,
and
as
far
as
the
law
of
this
case
is
concerned,
that
is
what
raiben
says.
now,
he
goes
on
to
a
dictum,
a
dictum
which
as
we
have
agreed,
has
been
adopted
as
the
opinion
of
the
courts
of
new
york.
what
does
the
dictum
state?
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
what
i
read
from
is
in
page
441
of
the
record,
the
raiben
opinion
begins
then
and
it
carries
on
to
page
441
now.
now,
let's
come
to
the
dictum.
the
dictum
says,
in
that
--
if
it
can
be
clearly
demonstrated
that
a
newsworthy
item
is
presented,
not
for
the
purpose
of
disseminating
news
but
rather
for
the
sole
purpose
of
increasing
circulation,
then
the
rationale
for
exemption
no
longer
exist.
and
in
such
circumstances,
the
privilege
to
use
ones
name
should
not
be
granted
even
though
it
should
counter
the
event
be
given,
and
that
is
what
concerns
mr.
justice
brennan.
let
me
point
this
up.
first,
it
is
not
the
law
of
this
case.
it
has
not
been
applied
in
any
new
york
case
in
63
years.
your
question,
of
course,
goes
to
whether
it
might
be
applied
in
some
future
case.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
for
this
court
to
send
back
this
case
in
which
mr.
justice
raiben
specifically
upholds
the
judgment
on
the
right
ground,
assuming
that
we
agree
it
is
the
right
ground
or
a
constitutional
ground.
on
the
basis
of
a
dictum,
i
think
it
certainly
would
not
be
appropriate
because
the
court
has
another
course
of
action.
the
court
can
affirm
this
case
on
its
facts
and
it
can
reject
the
dictum.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
well,
i've
tried
to
make
it
clear.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
same
what
raiben
case.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
raiben,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
(inaudible)
dissent.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
it
is
my
position,
stated
better
than
i
have.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
fortas,
what
i
--
what
i
say
also
is
that
--
as
i
state
here
is
this
11-year
old
case.
this
is
the
burden,
of
course,
for
the
defendant,
time.
this
11-year
old
case
has
been
a
burden
also
for
this
private
citizen.
and
for
--
after
11
years,
for
this
case
to
be
reversed
not
on
the
facts
of
this
case
but
to
be
reversed
on
a
dictum,
a
dictum
which
this
court
could
specifically
disavow.
it
seems
to
be
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
well,
i
understand.
i
was
only
mentioning
the
fact.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
no,
most
of
their
made
at
the
appellate
division.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
on
privacy?
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir,
in
flores
versus
mosler
safe.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
in
1960
--
it's
--
it's
a
later
opinion,
1964
--
1964
or
1965.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
and
which
involves
incidentally
an
advertising
use
and
which,
of
course,
is
declared.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
my
state
of
california?
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i'm
proud
to
be
in
california.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
can
i
answer
that?
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
button
and
dombrowski
were
both
new
statutes
in
which
declaratory
judgment
relief
was
requested
and
at
least
in
one
case.
in
neither
button
nor
dombrowski,
did
you
have
a
63-year
history
of
legislative
interpretation
completely
contrary
to
the
dictum.
therefore,
a
chilling
effect,
i
think,
could
be
seen
then.
i
think
that
distinguishes
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
i
--
i
don't
want
to
take
mr.
medina's
time.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
could
you
state
the
question
again,
sir?
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
judge's
charge,
it
seems
to
me,
has
to
be
read
in
connection
with
the
record
in
the
case,
the
record
of
testimony.
it
is
based
on
the
record
of
testimony.
and
in
that
connection,
the
judge's
charge
and
--
and
i
turn
briefly
to
it.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
sorry.
mr.
richard
m.
nixon
yes,
sir.
the
heart
of
the
charge,
it
is
for
you
to
determine
whether
in
publishing
the
article,
the
defendant,
time,
altered
or
changed
the
true
facts
concerning
plaintiff's
relationship
to
the
desperate
hours
so
that
the
article
as
published
constituted
fiction.
an
incidental
mistake
in
the
statement
of
a
fact,
the
facts
does
not
render
the
defendant
liable.
before
the
plaintiffs
can
be
entitled
to
a
verdict
against
the
defendant,
you
must
find
that
the
statements
concerning
the
plaintiffs
in
the
article
constituted
fiction.
now,
looking
at
the
record
of
the
case,
the
case
had
been
argued
on
the
basis
of
intentional
fictionalization.
and
in
that
connection,
let
me
quote
from
the
appellees'
closing
argument
to
the
jury.
in
this
case,
the
defendant,
time,
incorporated
is
charged
with
something
of
enormous
gravity.
we
charged
time
with
having
published
a
false
article,
falsely
dragging
the
plaintiffs
into
the
news,
falsely
linking
them
with
the
violent
melodramatic
work
of
fiction
for
commercial
purposes.
we
charge
this
most
powerful
of
all
news
publications
in
the
world
with
having
done
this
deliberately
with
knowledge
of
falsity
and
we
charge
them
with
having
brought
about
the
permanent
disability
of
a
human
being
by
reason
of
their
action.
now,
the
judge's
charge
alter
or
change
the
facts
substantially
in
order
to
create
a
more
interesting
story
for
commercial
purposes
was
what
--
was
the
heart
of
this
case
and
was
what
the
jury
found.
sorry,
sorry.
