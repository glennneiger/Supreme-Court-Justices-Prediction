justice
abe
fortas
are
you
going
to
describe
to
us
the
differences
between
the
play
and
the
book
and
the
real
life
incident?
justice
abe
fortas
just
the
general.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
well,
there
were
some
rather
ugly
incidents
or
incidents
that
might
be
considered
ugly.
it
took
place
in
the
house
on
--
in
accordance
with
the
narration
in
the
novel
and
the
play
that
did
not
take
place
in
actual
life,
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
isn't
that
so?
justice
abe
fortas
and
do
i
incorrectly
recall
or
incorrectly
characterize
them
when
i
say
they
were
rather
ugly?
justice
abe
fortas
your
adversary's
brief
indicates
that
there
were
some
indication
in
the
novel
and
in
the
play
of
sexual
danger
so
far
as
the
daughter
was
concerned
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
if
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
the
younger
brother?
justice
abe
fortas
does
it
make
any
difference
for
purposes
of
this
lawsuit
whether
the
play
was
or
was
not
based
on
the
incident,
that
is
to
say,
as
i
understand
it
and
perhaps
i'm
wrong,
this
is
an
action
under
the
new
york
“right
of
privacy”
statutes.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
real
thrust
of
it
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
--
your
client
without
the
permission
or
consent
of
the
hill
family
went
into
their
former
residence,
took
pictures
and
published
an
article
in
which
they
showed
pictures
of
the
former
residence
and
said
that
the
play
was
based
on
that.
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
that
was
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
true
or
false?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
really,
the
only
issue
that
we
have
before
us
is
whether
the
new
york
statute
either
on
its
face
or
as
applied
to
the
life
magazine
article
violates
first
amendment,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
want
you
to
go
on
and
(inaudible)
present
in
that
--
those
questions
to
us,
as
i
understand
you.
justice
abe
fortas
because
i
understand
your
petition
in
your
brief,
have
you
or
have
you
not?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
the
only
issue
that
you've
presented
to
us,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
because
it
occurred
three
years
later.
justice
abe
fortas
forgive
me,
two
and
a
half
years
later.
i'll
even
ask
the
question
two
years
later,
that
occurred
two
years
later,
does
that
same
principle
apply?
that's
really
the
problem
that
we
have.
in
other
words,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
let
us
suppose
that
news
--
this
incident
when
it
first
happened
was
news
and
let's
suppose
that
the
man's
house
could
be
visited
by
photographers
and
anything
could
be
publishing
them
but
they
wanted
to
with
the
(inaudible)
then
two
years
passed
and
out
of
--
and
without
anything
being
done
by
the
person
concerned,
the
photographers
without
his
consent
go
to
his
former
house
and
photographed
it
and
run
this
article
about
him
and
his
family.
and
then
you
have
to
add
to
that
the
fact
that
there
is
a
new
york
statute
that
on
its
face
seems
to
say
that
this
is
a
tort.
and
the
narrow
question
that
you're
presenting
to
us
is
not
the
question
it
seems
to
me
that
whether
the
first
amendment
impinges
upon
news
but
whether
the
first
amendment
impinges
upon
this
publication
which
i
have
described
which
took
this
--
which
was
issued
more
than
two
years
after
the
incident.
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
attack
this
statute
as
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
photographs
that
you
took
and
that
you
used
were
not
taken
from
the
(inaudible).
they
were
not
past
news
items.
you
deliberately
sent
a
photographer
out.
there
was
a
staging
of
incidence
there.
this
was
something
that
was
created
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
1955.
and
isn't
it
possible
that
there
is
a
difference
with
respect
to
first
in
--
for
purposes
of
first
amendment
between
the
creation
of
that
kind
of
a
news
item
or
that
kind
of
a
--
of
an
item
on
the
one
hand
and
the
use
of
past
news.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
creating
anything.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
not.
i'm
asking
if
there's
any
difference
with
respect
to
the
definition
of
news
for
this
purpose
between
the
use
of
something
that
appeared
in
the
press
in
1952
on
the
one
hand.
and
what
happened
here?
what
happened
here
is
that
you
sent
a
photographer
out
and
had
actors
there,
form
a
house,
you've
created
this
matter
too
which
you
then
used
without
the
permission
of
the
hill
family.
under
new
york
statute
we
have
the
--
we
have
to
take
validly.
the
judgment
of
the
court
is
if
the
new
york
statute
--
judgment
of
new
york
courts
was
--
the
new
york
statute
makes
this
a
tort.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
nixon,
how
is
the
play
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
why
your
relevant
here?
that
is
to
say
or
is
it
your
theory
that
the
life
article
by
referring
to
the
play
brings
the
entire
text
of
the
play
into
operation
for
legal
purposes
as
if
they
were
a
part
of
the
life
article?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
are
in
effect
then
saying
that
the
purposes
of
this
case
one
must
read
the
article
as
if
it
included
the
text
of
the
play.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
do
you
get
that
--
you
don't
get
that
from
the
statute,
you
get
it
from
the
cases,
i
assume
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
your
--
what
case
are
you
relying
on,
new
york?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
whatever
that
might
be,
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
so
far
as
we're
concerned,
we
will
have
to
take
it
that
the
question
of
liability
under
the
new
york
statute
is
foreclosed
and
the
question
before
us
is
the
--
its
impact
upon
first
amendment
rights.
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
try
to
clarify
it.
justice
abe
fortas
sidis
dealt
with
the
question
of
statutory
construction
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
new
york.
sidis
does
not
deal
with
the
first
amendment
impact
of
the
statute
on
its
face
or
as
applied,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
there
may
be
a
relationship
but
there's
--
i
don't
read
sidis
and
i
don't
recall
that
sidis
discusses
a
first
amendment
problem.
that
was
in
the
opinion
by
judge
clark.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
i
think
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
my
point
is
that
--
perhaps
the
point
is
that
this
--
are
you
saying
that
to
us
that
in
your
judgment
unless
we
conclude
that
the
judgment
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
was
based
on
the
falsity
of
the
article
then
we
must
conclude
that
this
is
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
is
that
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
--
how
about
the
purposes
of
new
york
law.
justice
abe
fortas
but
did
--
did
he
--
suppose
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
any
consequence
mr.
nixon,
that
is
to
say
the
basic
fact
is
that
life
magazine
sent
photographers
out
there
and
they
staged
this
incidence,
that's
right
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
suppose
that
the
incidence
had
been
staged
with
absolute
fidelity
to
the
actual
events
in
--
that
involved
the
hill
family.
this
is
a
kind
of
problem
that
we
have
to
explore
i
think
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
would
that
have
--
had
any
bearing
upon
whether
this
is
first
amendment,
this
statute
as
applied
violates
the
first
amendment.
that
is
to
say,
it
would
still
have
been
a
fictionalization
and
that's
important
i
take
it
according
to
your
argument
with
the
purpose
of
taking
it
out
of
the
category
of
news
whatever
bearing
that
may
have.
now,
if
you
have
--
does
the
truth
or
falsity
or
the
specific
accuracy
in
portraying
specific
events
have
a
bearing
on
this
or
isn't
the
operative
or
is
it
that
the
operative
fact
is
whether
they
took
existing
news
items
from
the
morgue
let's
say
or
on
the
other
hand
went
out
and
created
a
fictionalized
version
of
them.
justice
abe
fortas
all
i
meant
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
entirely
sure
of
that.
but
suppose
you
had
a
current
news
event
and
the
life
magazine
reported
it
and
they
reported
it
inaccurately.
would
that
make
that
report
of
that
current
news
event
subject
to
be
false
or
inaccurate
report
of
that
kind
of
news
event
subject
to
the
new
york
statute
consistently
with
the
first
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
at
--
constitutional
principle.
does
it
make
any
difference
with
respect
to
impact
of
first
amendment?
this
is
what
bothers
me
about
your
true
or
false
distinction
for
purposes
of
our
problem
which
is
--
i
take
it
to
be
a
first
amendment
problem.
suppose
the
new
york
statute
were
construed
and
applied
so
as
to
say
that
if
the
current
account
of
a
news
event
is
for
--
is
inaccurate
the
same
degree
with
this
life
magazine
as
arguably
inaccurate
then
the
new
york
statute
says
that
it's
an
invasion
of
the
“right
of
privacy”
is
the
fact
that
it's
inaccurate
even
though
it's
a
current
news
event,
make
it
a
fall
under
the
ban
on
the
first
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
you
had
answered
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
earlier
in
the
affirmative
that
is
to
say
if
newspaper
just
set
out,
wrote
a
story
based
upon
some
photographs
taken
of
the
intimacies
of
a
married
couple,
published
those
as
a
news
story
since
that's
not
fictionalized
in
the
usual
sense,
you
would
say
then
that
that
were
held
to
be
an
invasion
of
privacy
under
the
new
york
statute
this
court
should
find
that
the
new
york
statute
was
applied
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
is
that
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
their
problem
then
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
problem
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
our
problem
is
to
get
at
the
theory
of
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
that
you
would
say
that
mr.
justice
stewart's
example
if
i
understand
the
last
part
of
your
statement
just
now
that
that
could
not
constitutionally
be
held
to
invade
the
“right
of
privacy”.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
nixon,
in
what
connection
--
did
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
did
i
understand
you
earlier
to
concede,
i
don't
think
really
that
the
quality
of
life
magazine
is
different
as
i
see
it
but
did
i
understand
you
a
little
earlier
to
volunteer
the
statement
that
life
had
carefully
checked
the
story
or
that
they
had
a
practice
of
carefully
checking?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
say
“yes”
to
my
question?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you
conceding
here
that
this
article
was
carefully
checked
by
life
magazine
whatever
use
--
whatever
technique
they
used
except
for
those
two
words?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
may
lead
him
with
the
problem
in
the
event
that
we
don't
agree
that
somewhat
fictionalized
is
the
heart
of
the
case.
justice
abe
fortas
but
do
you
think
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
position
that
that
occurred?
and
you
submit
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
if
there
was?
isn't
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
by
reason
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
thanks
you.
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
think
that
harassment
wouldn't
be
an
exception
to
the
proposition
nine,
that
is,
simply
took
pictures
of
mrs.
blumenthal
frequently,
with
excessive
frequency,
then
you
think
that
that
might
be
under
the
invasion
of
her
right
under
the
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
fair
if
she
thought
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
she
probably
thought
that
either
there
was
intentional
harm
being
done
or
here
or
reckless
harm
because
she
didn't
like
the
way
she
was
being
presented
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
that
might
be
a
jury
question
but
on
that
--
on
your
theory,
that
would
bring
it
within
the
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
--
let's
do,
i
suggested
to
(inaudible)
that
if
you
say
that
harassment
of
that
person
by
repeated
picture
taking
might
bring
the
statute
into
play
without
running
around
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
why?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
tort?
justice
abe
fortas
what
--
what
is
a
tort?
justice
abe
fortas
what
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
kind
of
tort
do
you
call
that?
what
right
is
being
invaded?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
--
how
would
you
state
it?
what
is
this?
it's
--
what
right
is
being
protected
other
than
the
right
of
privacy?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
case
that
i
put
to
you
thought
--
i
put
to
you
the
blumenthal
case
with
the
element
that
you
had
in
which
it
was
the
element
of
harassment.
now,
let's
take
another
situation
talking
about
this
statute,
privacy
statute
of
new
york.
let's
suppose
the
new
york
times,
this
is
inconceivable
and
anybody
knows
that
paper.
just
for
example,
let's
suppose
if
the
new
york
times
published
a
(inaudible)
picture
of
certain
people
taken
in
their
own
bedroom.
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
kind
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
we're
dealing
--
we're
dealing
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
would
that
be
a
breach
of
this
statute,
violation
of
this
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
but
this
is
our
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
you
wouldn't
call
that
views,
would
you?
justice
abe
fortas
and
would
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
somebody's
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
somebody's
office,
suppose
there
were
picture
taken
in
somebody's
office,
would
you
--
i
gather
what
you're
now
saying
is
that
the
person
in
his
home
is
entitled
to
protection
under
the
--
as
a
matter
of
his
right
to
privacy,
is
that
what
you're
saying
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
that
does
not
run
or
apply
with
any
constitutional
prohibition.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
i
say
that
that
--
you
--
you
can
do
that
but
not
--
you
can
assert
a
crossmatching
for
that
tort
or
without
running
counter
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now,
how
about
the
office,
somebody's
office?
justice
abe
fortas
within
his
private
office,
you're
private
office
in
my
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
it's
a
work
here
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
want
to
cross
this
unduly
--
this
endeavor
but
i
do
want
to
get
the
theory
that
you're
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
asserting
here
and
that
what
you're
asserting
here,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
there
are
in
certain
circumstances,
rights
of
privacy,
the
invasion
of
which
gives
rise
to
a
cause
of
action
and
that
cause
of
action
in
those
circumstances
is
not
foreclosed
by
article
1
of
the
united
states
constitution.
justice
abe
fortas
right?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
medina,
did
you
say
--
did
i
correctly
understand
you
to
say
that
--
or
you
thought
that
a
negligent
misstatement
would
not
permit,
would
not
constitutionally
permit
the
imposition
of
any
sanction
that
a
statement
which
was
'grossfully'
negligent
or
willfully
negligent
would
constitutionally
permit
the
imposition
of
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
sanctions
by
a
statement.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
don't
believe
that
the
first
amendment
provides
federal
inhibition
upon
state
law
of
libel.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
can
we
--
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
then
i
--
then
our
problem
with
little
respect
anyway
maybe
to
draw
the
line
for
the
--
the
transitory
moment
of
history
between
negligence
and
willful
negligence
from
your
theory,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
let
me
ask
you
one
specific
question
as
--
let
me
put
to
you
a
specific
case.
let
us
suppose
that
there
is
presented
to
a
publisher,
to
the
editor
of
a
publication,
a
story
and
which
says
in
conspicuous
type,
“this
is
a
fictionalized
version
based
upon
an
incident
that
happened
to
joe
jones
and
his
friend.
this
is
a
fictionalized
version.”
and
then
the
editor
for
reasons
known
to
himself
about
any
inquiry
whatever,
strikes
that
sentence
and
publishes
the
article
as
it
is,
so
that
the
article
is
no
longer
represented
to
be
fictionalized.
now,
is
that
negligence,
wilful
negligence
or
an
intentional
misrepresentation?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
a
--
so
that
--
and
if
the
jury
--
well,
suppose
the
jury
had
imposed
liability,
would
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
operate
to
supervene
the
judgment
in
the
case?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
but
where
--
where
is
this?
there
are
two
different
things
in
there.
when
you
say
that
the
charge
that
you
requested
implies
that
time,
inc.
would
be
exonerated
if
it
knew
--
if
it
believed
that
the
statements
were
true.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
--
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
the
editor
above
mr.
prideaux,
man
above
mr.
prideaux
in
the
hierarchy,
you
thought,
believed
or
had
any
reason
to
think
or
believed
that
the
challenged
statements
were
true,
namely,
that
this
was
a
true
to
life
version
of
what
had
happened
to
the
hill
family?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
talking
about
the
editor
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
this
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
is
the
objection
to
your
request
of
instruction
that
there
would
be
--
that
there
was
no
basis
for
the
first
half
of
it
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
right.
now,
the
second
part
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
the
second
part
of
your
request
of
instruction,
as
i
remember,
required
affirmative
proof,
did
it
not,
of
--
of
knowledge
of
falsity?
justice
abe
fortas
required
if
it's
a
converse
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
the
point.
now,
is
it
your
position
that
it's
--
in
this
sort
of
a
case,
in
order
to
avoid
the
--
the
impact
of
the
first
amendment
that
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
statement
was
known
to
be
false?
justice
abe
fortas
your
point
is
that
it's
not
merely
a
matter
of
defense
but
then
its
part
of
the
plaintiff's
affirmative
burden.
justice
abe
fortas
but,
mr.
--
mr.
medina,
has
--
haven't
the
new
york
courts
said,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
new
york
courts
in
this
branch
of
the
law
have
been
clear,
[laughs]
but
haven't
the
new
york
court
said
at
sometime
that
fictionalization
means
the
creation
of
a
story
or
narrative
or
a
motion
picture
really
without
regard
to
its
factual
accuracy
and
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
a
story
or
romance
or
whatever
it
may
be
without
reference
to
its
coincidence
with
the
facts
of
life.
isn't
that
about
what
they
have
said?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
gather,
and
i
may
be
--
this
might
be
quite
wrong.
what
i
gathered
from
as
much
as
i
can
gather
anything
specific
from
these
new
york
cases
on
the
subject
of
fictionalization
that
the
new
york
courts
were
trying
to
convey
the
idea
of
--
that
it
is
a
work
of
fiction
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
that
term
that
is
to
say
something
that
is
presented
as
primarily
a
product
of
the
imagination,
whether
or
not
it
--
it
has
a
basis
or
kernel
of
truth
as
most
works
of
the
imagination
do.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
don't
you
have
that
problem
all
the
time
practically
everyday
with
respect
to
the
laws
of
libel?
justice
abe
fortas
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
in
--
and
in
between.
justice
abe
fortas
and
--
and
how
about
private
--
how
about
private
areas?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
--
that's
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
don't
we
have
at
least
--
would
you
agree
that
we
have
a
question
here
as
to
whether,
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
we're
dealing
essentially
with
something
in
the
public
area
or
essentially
with
something
in
the
private
area.
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
to
something
that's
half
of
one
and
half
of
the
other.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
mean
hills.
justice
abe
fortas
which
you
read
on
page
441
of
the
record.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
nixon.
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
the
position
before
us,
as
congress,
it's
as
if
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
itself
written
a
majority
opinion
and
the
concurring
opinion
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
which
or
--
and
so
that
all
the
justices
--
i
suppose
maybe
that's
not
right.
it
says
if
the
entire
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
written
an
opinion
which
contains
everything,
that
is
in
the
majority
and
in
the
concurring
opinion
of
the
appellate
division.
justice
abe
fortas
ow,
i
would
myself
have
the
greatest
difficulty
in
sustaining
any
holding
of
the
court,
the
state
court
and
the
other
courts
to
the
effect
or
the
sense
that
you
have
just
read.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
gather
that
that's
not
foreign
to
your
own
act,
you
[laughs]
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
you've
said
here.
but
your
position
is
that
if
we
look
at
the
majority
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
the
appellate
division,
at
least,
i
think,
your
position
is,
if
we
look
at
the
majority
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
the
appellate
division,
that
we
are
entitled
and
i
--
we
should
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
holding
of
the
court
is
not
embraced
in
this
single
sentence
or
the
two
sentences
from
the
judge
botein's
unhappy
concurring
opinion
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
the
course
of
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
judge
raiben's
concurring
opinion
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
which
have
been
causing
us
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
a
lot
of
trouble,
is
that
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
--
and
that
the
--
that
the
--
an
opinion
of
the
court
below,
and
i
am
assuming
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
written
all
these
stuff
that's
in
both
opinions.
justice
abe
fortas
we
started
reversing
cases
on
the
basis
of
dicta
and
opinions.
i
suppose
we'd
be
having
a
merry
old
time
like
this.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
know
if
the
question
is
awfully
important.
perhaps,
it's
too
important
appearing
on
that,
for
me,
in
the
way.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
that
most
of
these
actually
direct
--
directly
recall
that
there
are
really
very
few
opinions
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
i'd
forgotten
at
the
moment.
is
blumenthal
the
court
of
appeals
opinion?
justice
abe
fortas
and
blumenthal
is
appellate
division,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
true
of
almost
--
most
of
the
cases
here
and
when
you
start
looking
for
--
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
they
have
not
honored
us
or
helped
us
very
often
with
opinions.
what
is
their
latest
court
of
appeals
opinion,
do
you
remember?
in
what
case?
justice
abe
fortas
to
their
right
and
what
is
the
latest
case
in
which
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
new
york
court
of
appeals
actually
wrote
an
opinion
on
this
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
what
--
what
year
was
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
certain
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
--
all
right,
i'm
sorry
i've
taken
so
much
of
your
time
and
you
still
have
justice
harlan's
question.
justice
abe
fortas
is
the
reenactment
and
being
inspired
by,
are
those
exactly
the
same?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
this
--
this
--
substantially
the
same
either
under
american
or
british
law?
justice
abe
fortas
it
must
be
ambiguous
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
you.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
and
there
were
findings
below.
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that
inaccurate?
justice
abe
fortas
all
right.
justice
abe
fortas
now
--
now,
i
--
i
want
to
ask
you
about
something
you
said
a
minute
ago.
assuming
that
the
publication
is
false,
assuming
that
it
is
knowingly
false.
this
particular
publication
is
--
i
--
i
don't
understand
your
constitutional
position.
is
it
your
--
justice
abe
fortas
assuming
that
the
article
is
false
that
it
was
known
to
be
false,
and
now,
can
we
sustain
the
application
of
the
new
york
statute
to
this
situation
in
view
the
first
amendment,
what
is
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
you
to
assume
that.
will
you
please
assume
that?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
first
--
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
all
right.
that's
what
i
wanted
to
find
out.
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
going
to
describe
to
us
the
differences
between
the
play
and
the
book
and
the
real
life
incident?
justice
abe
fortas
just
the
general.
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
well,
there
were
some
rather
ugly
incidents
or
incidents
that
might
be
considered
ugly.
it
took
place
in
the
house
on
--
in
accordance
with
the
narration
in
the
novel
and
the
play
that
did
not
take
place
in
actual
life,
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
isn't
that
so?
justice
abe
fortas
and
do
i
incorrectly
recall
or
incorrectly
characterize
them
when
i
say
they
were
rather
ugly?
justice
abe
fortas
your
adversary's
brief
indicates
that
there
were
some
indication
in
the
novel
and
in
the
play
of
sexual
danger
so
far
as
the
daughter
was
concerned
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
if
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
how
about
the
younger
brother?
justice
abe
fortas
does
it
make
any
difference
for
purposes
of
this
lawsuit
whether
the
play
was
or
was
not
based
on
the
incident,
that
is
to
say,
as
i
understand
it
and
perhaps
i'm
wrong,
this
is
an
action
under
the
new
york
“right
of
privacy”
statutes.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
real
thrust
of
it
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
--
your
client
without
the
permission
or
consent
of
the
hill
family
went
into
their
former
residence,
took
pictures
and
published
an
article
in
which
they
showed
pictures
of
the
former
residence
and
said
that
the
play
was
based
on
that.
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
that
was
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
true
or
false?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
really,
the
only
issue
that
we
have
before
us
is
whether
the
new
york
statute
either
on
its
face
or
as
applied
to
the
life
magazine
article
violates
first
amendment,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
want
you
to
go
on
and
(inaudible)
present
in
that
--
those
questions
to
us,
as
i
understand
you.
justice
abe
fortas
because
i
understand
your
petition
in
your
brief,
have
you
or
have
you
not?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
the
only
issue
that
you've
presented
to
us,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
because
it
occurred
three
years
later.
justice
abe
fortas
forgive
me,
two
and
a
half
years
later.
i'll
even
ask
the
question
two
years
later,
that
occurred
two
years
later,
does
that
same
principle
apply?
that's
really
the
problem
that
we
have.
in
other
words,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
let
us
suppose
that
news
--
this
incident
when
it
first
happened
was
news
and
let's
suppose
that
the
man's
house
could
be
visited
by
photographers
and
anything
could
be
publishing
them
but
they
wanted
to
with
the
(inaudible)
then
two
years
passed
and
out
of
--
and
without
anything
being
done
by
the
person
concerned,
the
photographers
without
his
consent
go
to
his
former
house
and
photographed
it
and
run
this
article
about
him
and
his
family.
and
then
you
have
to
add
to
that
the
fact
that
there
is
a
new
york
statute
that
on
its
face
seems
to
say
that
this
is
a
tort.
and
the
narrow
question
that
you're
presenting
to
us
is
not
the
question
it
seems
to
me
that
whether
the
first
amendment
impinges
upon
news
but
whether
the
first
amendment
impinges
upon
this
publication
which
i
have
described
which
took
this
--
which
was
issued
more
than
two
years
after
the
incident.
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
attack
this
statute
as
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
photographs
that
you
took
and
that
you
used
were
not
taken
from
the
(inaudible).
they
were
not
past
news
items.
you
deliberately
sent
a
photographer
out.
there
was
a
staging
of
incidence
there.
this
was
something
that
was
created
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
1955.
and
isn't
it
possible
that
there
is
a
difference
with
respect
to
first
in
--
for
purposes
of
first
amendment
between
the
creation
of
that
kind
of
a
news
item
or
that
kind
of
a
--
of
an
item
on
the
one
hand
and
the
use
of
past
news.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
creating
anything.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
not.
i'm
asking
if
there's
any
difference
with
respect
to
the
definition
of
news
for
this
purpose
between
the
use
of
something
that
appeared
in
the
press
in
1952
on
the
one
hand.
and
what
happened
here?
what
happened
here
is
that
you
sent
a
photographer
out
and
had
actors
there,
form
a
house,
you've
created
this
matter
too
which
you
then
used
without
the
permission
of
the
hill
family.
under
new
york
statute
we
have
the
--
we
have
to
take
validly.
the
judgment
of
the
court
is
if
the
new
york
statute
--
judgment
of
new
york
courts
was
--
the
new
york
statute
makes
this
a
tort.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
nixon,
how
is
the
play
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
why
your
relevant
here?
that
is
to
say
or
is
it
your
theory
that
the
life
article
by
referring
to
the
play
brings
the
entire
text
of
the
play
into
operation
for
legal
purposes
as
if
they
were
a
part
of
the
life
article?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
are
in
effect
then
saying
that
the
purposes
of
this
case
one
must
read
the
article
as
if
it
included
the
text
of
the
play.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
do
you
get
that
--
you
don't
get
that
from
the
statute,
you
get
it
from
the
cases,
i
assume
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
your
--
what
case
are
you
relying
on,
new
york?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
whatever
that
might
be,
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
so
far
as
we're
concerned,
we
will
have
to
take
it
that
the
question
of
liability
under
the
new
york
statute
is
foreclosed
and
the
question
before
us
is
the
--
its
impact
upon
first
amendment
rights.
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
try
to
clarify
it.
justice
abe
fortas
sidis
dealt
with
the
question
of
statutory
construction
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
new
york.
sidis
does
not
deal
with
the
first
amendment
impact
of
the
statute
on
its
face
or
as
applied,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
there
may
be
a
relationship
but
there's
--
i
don't
read
sidis
and
i
don't
recall
that
sidis
discusses
a
first
amendment
problem.
that
was
in
the
opinion
by
judge
clark.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
i
think
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
my
point
is
that
--
perhaps
the
point
is
that
this
--
are
you
saying
that
to
us
that
in
your
judgment
unless
we
conclude
that
the
judgment
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
was
based
on
the
falsity
of
the
article
then
we
must
conclude
that
this
is
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
is
that
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
--
how
about
the
purposes
of
new
york
law.
justice
abe
fortas
but
did
--
did
he
--
suppose
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
any
consequence
mr.
nixon,
that
is
to
say
the
basic
fact
is
that
life
magazine
sent
photographers
out
there
and
they
staged
this
incidence,
that's
right
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
suppose
that
the
incidence
had
been
staged
with
absolute
fidelity
to
the
actual
events
in
--
that
involved
the
hill
family.
this
is
a
kind
of
problem
that
we
have
to
explore
i
think
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
would
that
have
--
had
any
bearing
upon
whether
this
is
first
amendment,
this
statute
as
applied
violates
the
first
amendment.
that
is
to
say,
it
would
still
have
been
a
fictionalization
and
that's
important
i
take
it
according
to
your
argument
with
the
purpose
of
taking
it
out
of
the
category
of
news
whatever
bearing
that
may
have.
now,
if
you
have
--
does
the
truth
or
falsity
or
the
specific
accuracy
in
portraying
specific
events
have
a
bearing
on
this
or
isn't
the
operative
or
is
it
that
the
operative
fact
is
whether
they
took
existing
news
items
from
the
morgue
let's
say
or
on
the
other
hand
went
out
and
created
a
fictionalized
version
of
them.
justice
abe
fortas
all
i
meant
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
entirely
sure
of
that.
but
suppose
you
had
a
current
news
event
and
the
life
magazine
reported
it
and
they
reported
it
inaccurately.
would
that
make
that
report
of
that
current
news
event
subject
to
be
false
or
inaccurate
report
of
that
kind
of
news
event
subject
to
the
new
york
statute
consistently
with
the
first
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
at
--
constitutional
principle.
does
it
make
any
difference
with
respect
to
impact
of
first
amendment?
this
is
what
bothers
me
about
your
true
or
false
distinction
for
purposes
of
our
problem
which
is
--
i
take
it
to
be
a
first
amendment
problem.
suppose
the
new
york
statute
were
construed
and
applied
so
as
to
say
that
if
the
current
account
of
a
news
event
is
for
--
is
inaccurate
the
same
degree
with
this
life
magazine
as
arguably
inaccurate
then
the
new
york
statute
says
that
it's
an
invasion
of
the
“right
of
privacy”
is
the
fact
that
it's
inaccurate
even
though
it's
a
current
news
event,
make
it
a
fall
under
the
ban
on
the
first
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
you
had
answered
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
earlier
in
the
affirmative
that
is
to
say
if
newspaper
just
set
out,
wrote
a
story
based
upon
some
photographs
taken
of
the
intimacies
of
a
married
couple,
published
those
as
a
news
story
since
that's
not
fictionalized
in
the
usual
sense,
you
would
say
then
that
that
were
held
to
be
an
invasion
of
privacy
under
the
new
york
statute
this
court
should
find
that
the
new
york
statute
was
applied
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
is
that
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
their
problem
then
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
problem
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
our
problem
is
to
get
at
the
theory
of
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
that
you
would
say
that
mr.
justice
stewart's
example
if
i
understand
the
last
part
of
your
statement
just
now
that
that
could
not
constitutionally
be
held
to
invade
the
“right
of
privacy”.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
nixon,
in
what
connection
--
did
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
did
i
understand
you
earlier
to
concede,
i
don't
think
really
that
the
quality
of
life
magazine
is
different
as
i
see
it
but
did
i
understand
you
a
little
earlier
to
volunteer
the
statement
that
life
had
carefully
checked
the
story
or
that
they
had
a
practice
of
carefully
checking?
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
say
“yes”
to
my
question?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you
conceding
here
that
this
article
was
carefully
checked
by
life
magazine
whatever
use
--
whatever
technique
they
used
except
for
those
two
words?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
may
lead
him
with
the
problem
in
the
event
that
we
don't
agree
that
somewhat
fictionalized
is
the
heart
of
the
case.
justice
abe
fortas
but
do
you
think
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
position
that
that
occurred?
and
you
submit
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
(inaudible)
if
there
was?
isn't
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
by
reason
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
thanks
you.
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
think
that
harassment
wouldn't
be
an
exception
to
the
proposition
nine,
that
is,
simply
took
pictures
of
mrs.
blumenthal
frequently,
with
excessive
frequency,
then
you
think
that
that
might
be
under
the
invasion
of
her
right
under
the
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
fair
if
she
thought
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
she
probably
thought
that
either
there
was
intentional
harm
being
done
or
here
or
reckless
harm
because
she
didn't
like
the
way
she
was
being
presented
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
that
might
be
a
jury
question
but
on
that
--
on
your
theory,
that
would
bring
it
within
the
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
--
let's
do,
i
suggested
to
(inaudible)
that
if
you
say
that
harassment
of
that
person
by
repeated
picture
taking
might
bring
the
statute
into
play
without
running
around
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
why?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
tort?
justice
abe
fortas
what
--
what
is
a
tort?
justice
abe
fortas
what
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
kind
of
tort
do
you
call
that?
what
right
is
being
invaded?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
--
how
would
you
state
it?
what
is
this?
it's
--
what
right
is
being
protected
other
than
the
right
of
privacy?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
case
that
i
put
to
you
thought
--
i
put
to
you
the
blumenthal
case
with
the
element
that
you
had
in
which
it
was
the
element
of
harassment.
now,
let's
take
another
situation
talking
about
this
statute,
privacy
statute
of
new
york.
let's
suppose
the
new
york
times,
this
is
inconceivable
and
anybody
knows
that
paper.
just
for
example,
let's
suppose
if
the
new
york
times
published
a
(inaudible)
picture
of
certain
people
taken
in
their
own
bedroom.
now
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
kind
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
we're
dealing
--
we're
dealing
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
would
that
be
a
breach
of
this
statute,
violation
of
this
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
but
this
is
our
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
you
wouldn't
call
that
views,
would
you?
justice
abe
fortas
and
would
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
somebody's
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
somebody's
office,
suppose
there
were
picture
taken
in
somebody's
office,
would
you
--
i
gather
what
you're
now
saying
is
that
the
person
in
his
home
is
entitled
to
protection
under
the
--
as
a
matter
of
his
right
to
privacy,
is
that
what
you're
saying
or
not?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
that
does
not
run
or
apply
with
any
constitutional
prohibition.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
i
say
that
that
--
you
--
you
can
do
that
but
not
--
you
can
assert
a
crossmatching
for
that
tort
or
without
running
counter
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now,
how
about
the
office,
somebody's
office?
justice
abe
fortas
within
his
private
office,
you're
private
office
in
my
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
it's
a
work
here
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
want
to
cross
this
unduly
--
this
endeavor
but
i
do
want
to
get
the
theory
that
you're
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
asserting
here
and
that
what
you're
asserting
here,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
there
are
in
certain
circumstances,
rights
of
privacy,
the
invasion
of
which
gives
rise
to
a
cause
of
action
and
that
cause
of
action
in
those
circumstances
is
not
foreclosed
by
article
1
of
the
united
states
constitution.
justice
abe
fortas
right?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
medina,
did
you
say
--
did
i
correctly
understand
you
to
say
that
--
or
you
thought
that
a
negligent
misstatement
would
not
permit,
would
not
constitutionally
permit
the
imposition
of
any
sanction
that
a
statement
which
was
'grossfully'
negligent
or
willfully
negligent
would
constitutionally
permit
the
imposition
of
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
sanctions
by
a
statement.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
don't
believe
that
the
first
amendment
provides
federal
inhibition
upon
state
law
of
libel.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
how
can
we
--
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
then
i
--
then
our
problem
with
little
respect
anyway
maybe
to
draw
the
line
for
the
--
the
transitory
moment
of
history
between
negligence
and
willful
negligence
from
your
theory,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
let
me
ask
you
one
specific
question
as
--
let
me
put
to
you
a
specific
case.
let
us
suppose
that
there
is
presented
to
a
publisher,
to
the
editor
of
a
publication,
a
story
and
which
says
in
conspicuous
type,
“this
is
a
fictionalized
version
based
upon
an
incident
that
happened
to
joe
jones
and
his
friend.
this
is
a
fictionalized
version.”
and
then
the
editor
for
reasons
known
to
himself
about
any
inquiry
whatever,
strikes
that
sentence
and
publishes
the
article
as
it
is,
so
that
the
article
is
no
longer
represented
to
be
fictionalized.
now,
is
that
negligence,
wilful
negligence
or
an
intentional
misrepresentation?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
a
--
so
that
--
and
if
the
jury
--
well,
suppose
the
jury
had
imposed
liability,
would
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
operate
to
supervene
the
judgment
in
the
case?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
but
where
--
where
is
this?
there
are
two
different
things
in
there.
when
you
say
that
the
charge
that
you
requested
implies
that
time,
inc.
would
be
exonerated
if
it
knew
--
if
it
believed
that
the
statements
were
true.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
--
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
the
editor
above
mr.
prideaux,
man
above
mr.
prideaux
in
the
hierarchy,
you
thought,
believed
or
had
any
reason
to
think
or
believed
that
the
challenged
statements
were
true,
namely,
that
this
was
a
true
to
life
version
of
what
had
happened
to
the
hill
family?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
talking
about
the
editor
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
this
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
why
is
the
objection
to
your
request
of
instruction
that
there
would
be
--
that
there
was
no
basis
for
the
first
half
of
it
in
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
right.
now,
the
second
part
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
the
second
part
of
your
request
of
instruction,
as
i
remember,
required
affirmative
proof,
did
it
not,
of
--
of
knowledge
of
falsity?
justice
abe
fortas
required
if
it's
a
converse
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
the
point.
now,
is
it
your
position
that
it's
--
in
this
sort
of
a
case,
in
order
to
avoid
the
--
the
impact
of
the
first
amendment
that
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
statement
was
known
to
be
false?
justice
abe
fortas
your
point
is
that
it's
not
merely
a
matter
of
defense
but
then
its
part
of
the
plaintiff's
affirmative
burden.
justice
abe
fortas
but,
mr.
--
mr.
medina,
has
--
haven't
the
new
york
courts
said,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
new
york
courts
in
this
branch
of
the
law
have
been
clear,
[laughs]
but
haven't
the
new
york
court
said
at
sometime
that
fictionalization
means
the
creation
of
a
story
or
narrative
or
a
motion
picture
really
without
regard
to
its
factual
accuracy
and
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
a
story
or
romance
or
whatever
it
may
be
without
reference
to
its
coincidence
with
the
facts
of
life.
isn't
that
about
what
they
have
said?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
gather,
and
i
may
be
--
this
might
be
quite
wrong.
what
i
gathered
from
as
much
as
i
can
gather
anything
specific
from
these
new
york
cases
on
the
subject
of
fictionalization
that
the
new
york
courts
were
trying
to
convey
the
idea
of
--
that
it
is
a
work
of
fiction
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
that
term
that
is
to
say
something
that
is
presented
as
primarily
a
product
of
the
imagination,
whether
or
not
it
--
it
has
a
basis
or
kernel
of
truth
as
most
works
of
the
imagination
do.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
don't
you
have
that
problem
all
the
time
practically
everyday
with
respect
to
the
laws
of
libel?
justice
abe
fortas
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
in
--
and
in
between.
justice
abe
fortas
and
--
and
how
about
private
--
how
about
private
areas?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
--
that's
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
don't
we
have
at
least
--
would
you
agree
that
we
have
a
question
here
as
to
whether,
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
we're
dealing
essentially
with
something
in
the
public
area
or
essentially
with
something
in
the
private
area.
justice
abe
fortas
i
mean
to
something
that's
half
of
one
and
half
of
the
other.
justice
abe
fortas
(voice

--
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
mean
hills.
justice
abe
fortas
which
you
read
on
page
441
of
the
record.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
nixon.
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
the
position
before
us,
as
congress,
it's
as
if
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
itself
written
a
majority
opinion
and
the
concurring
opinion
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
which
or
--
and
so
that
all
the
justices
--
i
suppose
maybe
that's
not
right.
it
says
if
the
entire
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
written
an
opinion
which
contains
everything,
that
is
in
the
majority
and
in
the
concurring
opinion
of
the
appellate
division.
justice
abe
fortas
ow,
i
would
myself
have
the
greatest
difficulty
in
sustaining
any
holding
of
the
court,
the
state
court
and
the
other
courts
to
the
effect
or
the
sense
that
you
have
just
read.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
gather
that
that's
not
foreign
to
your
own
act,
you
[laughs]
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
what
you've
said
here.
but
your
position
is
that
if
we
look
at
the
majority
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
the
appellate
division,
at
least,
i
think,
your
position
is,
if
we
look
at
the
majority
and
the
concurring
opinion
of
the
appellate
division,
that
we
are
entitled
and
i
--
we
should
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
holding
of
the
court
is
not
embraced
in
this
single
sentence
or
the
two
sentences
from
the
judge
botein's
unhappy
concurring
opinion
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
the
course
of
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
judge
raiben's
concurring
opinion
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
which
have
been
causing
us
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
a
lot
of
trouble,
is
that
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
--
and
that
the
--
that
the
--
an
opinion
of
the
court
below,
and
i
am
assuming
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
written
all
these
stuff
that's
in
both
opinions.
justice
abe
fortas
we
started
reversing
cases
on
the
basis
of
dicta
and
opinions.
i
suppose
we'd
be
having
a
merry
old
time
like
this.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
know
if
the
question
is
awfully
important.
perhaps,
it's
too
important
appearing
on
that,
for
me,
in
the
way.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
that
most
of
these
actually
direct
--
directly
recall
that
there
are
really
very
few
opinions
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
i'd
forgotten
at
the
moment.
is
blumenthal
the
court
of
appeals
opinion?
justice
abe
fortas
and
blumenthal
is
appellate
division,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
true
of
almost
--
most
of
the
cases
here
and
when
you
start
looking
for
--
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
they
have
not
honored
us
or
helped
us
very
often
with
opinions.
what
is
their
latest
court
of
appeals
opinion,
do
you
remember?
in
what
case?
justice
abe
fortas
to
their
right
and
what
is
the
latest
case
in
which
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
new
york
court
of
appeals
actually
wrote
an
opinion
on
this
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
what
--
what
year
was
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
certain
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
--
all
right,
i'm
sorry
i've
taken
so
much
of
your
time
and
you
still
have
justice
harlan's
question.
justice
abe
fortas
is
the
reenactment
and
being
inspired
by,
are
those
exactly
the
same?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
this
--
this
--
substantially
the
same
either
under
american
or
british
law?
justice
abe
fortas
it
must
be
ambiguous
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
for
you.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
and
there
were
findings
below.
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
that
inaccurate?
justice
abe
fortas
all
right.
justice
abe
fortas
now
--
now,
i
--
i
want
to
ask
you
about
something
you
said
a
minute
ago.
assuming
that
the
publication
is
false,
assuming
that
it
is
knowingly
false.
this
particular
publication
is
--
i
--
i
don't
understand
your
constitutional
position.
is
it
your
--
justice
abe
fortas
assuming
that
the
article
is
false
that
it
was
known
to
be
false,
and
now,
can
we
sustain
the
application
of
the
new
york
statute
to
this
situation
in
view
the
first
amendment,
what
is
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
asking
you
to
assume
that.
will
you
please
assume
that?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
first
--
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
all
right.
that's
what
i
wanted
to
find
out.
