mr.
gardiner
johnson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
about
all
i
would
have
time
to
say
this
afternoon
would
be
that
i
dissent.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
contract
which
is
the
subject
of
this
litigation
was
signed
on
march
the
19th,
1953
between
utah
construction
company
as
it
was
then
known
and
the
united
states
atomic
energy
commission,
idaho
operations
office.
the
amount
of
the
original
contract
was
$4,583,000
approximately.
because
of
many
change
orders
involved,
the
eventual
amount
paid
was
substantially
more
than
that.
the
total
amount
of
the
claim
which
is
involved
in
this
litigation
is
approximately
$1.5
million.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court,
for
informational
purposes
only
that
the
work
involved
was
completed
on
january
the
7th
of
1955.
the
contract,
a
particular
government
contract,
is
the
usual
united
states
standard
form
number
23
and
as
was
developed
in
another
case
yesterday
and
at
the
time
we
thought
over
enthusiastically
the
particular
article
of
the
contract
which
is
the
center
of
this
controversy
is
article
15
generally
known
as
the
standard
government
dispute
clause.
so
that
as
far
as
the
denomination
of
the
contract
is
concerned
and
particularly
the
disputes
clause,
they
are
standard
that
there
is
nothing
--
there
is
and
there
was
nothing
standard,
nothing
routine,
nothing
orthodox
about
the
work
that
was
involved
without
becoming
involved
in
course
and
the
craftsman
employed
by
utah
construction
company
now
utah
construction
&
mining
company
were
out
on
the
flat
plains
of
idaho
attempting
to
construct
this
structure.
and
when
in
this
litigation
and
in
the
claims,
we
talked
about
walls.
we
are
not
talking
about
the
conventional
walls
of
a
building,
we
are
talking
about
and
speaking
of
interior
walls
of
solid
concrete,
5
feet
in
thickness.
and
the
exterior
walls
were
from
7
to
10
feet
in
thickness.
when
we
speak
of
windows,
one
of
the
claims
involves
shield
windows
so-called.
we
are
not
speaking
of
traditional
windows,
we
are
speaking
of
specially
designed
blocks
of
glass
7
feet
by
5
in
dimensions,
5
feet
thick,
and
one
section
of
which
weighed
3500
pounds.
so
that
as
i
say,
there
was
nothing
orthodox
or
routine
about
the
nature
of
the
construction,
and
that
of
course
is
reflected
in
the
complexity
of
the
claims.
with
respect
to
our
petition,
which
is
--
and
our
claim
which
is
actually
currently
were
subject
to
this
litigation,
i
think
it
needs
to
be
pointed
out
as
it
has
not
been
done
up
to
this
moment
that
our
petition
as
filed
in
the
court
of
claims
and
which
is
set
forth
in
the
record
of
page
1.
our
petition
sets
forth
as
our
legal
effort
one
single
cause
of
action
for
breach
of
contract.
in
behalf
of
our
client,
the
contractor
we
are
seeking
unliquidated
damages
for
a
breach
of
contract
by
the
united
states
government
arising
out
of
government
caused
delays.
but
the
point
that
i
desire
to
emphasize
because
it's
the
very
basis
of
the
problem,
is
that
we
have
filed
in
the
court
of
claims
pursuant
to
statutory
authority,
as
we
must,
a
cause
of
action
for
our
breach
of
contract.
the
questions
here
involved
them.
the
claims
are
breached
--
the
claim
is
breach
of
contract.
we
file
this
under
a
statutory
proceeding,
a
statutory
authority,
the
so-called
tucker
act
which
provides
that
claims
founded
upon
expressed
or
employed
contract
are
enforceable
against
the
united
states
government
because
of
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
which
is
contained
in
the
tucker
act.
that's
congressional
statute
vest
in
the
united
states
court
of
claims
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
claims
against
the
government
arising
out
of
contract
except
for
those
under
$10,000.
i
would
assume
so
that
the
contractor
involved
who
had
the
small
claim,
would
not
have
to
journey
to
washington,
congress
in
its
wisdom
provided
that
he
might
try
his
claim
in
the
local
district
court
of
the
united
states.
about
our
claim,
one
more
very
important
thing
needs
to
be
made
clear
at
the
very
start.
this
action
is
a
direct
and
an
independent
act
application
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims
pursuant
to
the
statutory
authority.
we
are
not
here
seeking
a
review.
this
is
in
no
sense
an
appeal
from
an
administrative
body's
decision.
we
applied
directly
and
independently
on
our
breach
of
contract
theory
and
there
is
no
review
here
involved.
i
emphasize
this
because
we
feel
that
much
if
not
all
of
the
government's
argument
both
in
the
briefs
and
as
expressed
yesterday
is
beside
the
point
because
they
speak
of
our
claim
as
if
it
is
a
matter
of
appeal
or
review
which
it
is
not.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
yes
mr.--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
my
answer
to
that
your
honor,
i
hope
is
direct.
if
the
claim
were
strictly
within
the
contract
and
nothing
more,
i
feel
the
bianchi
decision
as
expressed,
well,
i
may
not
agree
with
that
in
all
respects.
i
would
be
compelled
to
say
that
i
think
that
would
be
binding
but
that
is
not
our
situation
at
all.
as
i
will
point
out,
as
i
proceed,
that
every
stage
of
the
administrative
proceeding
from
the
very
beginning
when
the
contracting
officer
made
this
decision,
when
the
government
counsel
filed
their
pleadings,
when
the
appeals
were
rendered
its
decisions,
they
precluded
us
from
introducing
evidence
which
they
said
related
to
breach
of
contract.
we
endeavored
at
the
hearing
to
put
in
such
evidence
because
we
were
attempting
at
the
time,
as
i
think
any
contractor
does,
when
you
are
before
an
appeals
board,
you
are
hoping
to
get
a
prompt
and
a
fair
settlement,
and
to
get
on
with
new
work.
and
so
your
basic
effort
is
to
get
into
the
record
to
get
before
the
court
every
item,
every
dollar
of
claim
that
you
can.
and
we
tried
confessedly
to
make
no
apology
for
it.
we
attempted
to
get
everything
that
was
even
remotely
borderline
as
being
--
as
you
point
out
within
the
scope
of
the
disputes
clause.
but
by
formal
documents
filed
by
the
attorneys
for
the
government,
by
rulings
on
evidence,
during
the
hearings
and
by
their
decisions,
we
were
foreclosed.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
i
think
i
can,
your
honor.
very
clearly
the
one
that
is
known
as
the
aggre
--
concrete
aggregates
claim
which
we
among
ourselves
refer
to
as
the
dirty
aggregates
claim
that
was
--
as
denominated
by
everyone
who
considered
it,
it
was
referred
to
by
the
government
representatives
as
a
breach
of
warranty.
and
therefore
quite
clearly
we
think
that
entire
claim
was
without
the
normal
scope
of
the
disputes
clause
similarly
on
the
one
which
is
denominated
as
the
pier
drilling.
there
were
aspects
of
that,
very
substantial
aspects
of
that
which
were
ruled
at
all
levels
to
be
beyond
the
normal
scope
of
the
disputes
clause
and
in
the
nature
of
breach
of
contract
and
that
both
of
those
are
very
substantial
claims
so
that
there
can
be
no
question
in
our
case.
we
think
there
has
not
been
at
any
level,
administratively
or
otherwise,
that
our
petition
before
the
court
of
claims
does
not
in
fact
involve
true
breach
of
contract
and
items
which
concededly
are
beyond
the
scope
of
the
disputes
clause.
and
as
i've
indicated
to
the
court,
this
is
no
academic
position
that
we
take.
we
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
because
there
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
yes,
your
honor
and
well
--
and
one
other
point
which
i
think
one
of
your
questions
yesterday
developed
that
nowhere
in
the
contract,
standard
form
23
in
any
of
the
sections,
and
i'm
thinking
now
specifically
of
article
9,
the
so-called
delay
damages
clause,
but
nowhere
in
the
contract
is
there
any
provision
by
which
when
you
alleged
that
the
government
has
delayed
you
and
thereby
damaged
you,
nowhere
is
there
any
provision
for
a
substitute
compensatory
relief
item,
either
by
what
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
an
item
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
well,
i
would
express
it
this
way,
your
honor
that
there
are
claims
which
are
so
distinctly
breach
of
contract.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
that
is
right.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
your
statement
of
the
basis
of
it
is
correct.
in
the
nomenclature
of
the
decisions
down
through
the
years
including
those
in
this
case,
it
has
been
expressed
in
terms
of
breach
of
contract.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
that
is
correct.
but
as
was
pointed
out
or
raised
by
one
of
your
questions
yesterday,
there
are
other
reasons
why
you
--
why
a
contractor
has
to
proceed
under
certain
clauses
of
the
contract
even
though
he
feels
that
his
claim
may
really
be
breach
of
contract
and
we
did
it
here.
we
obtained
administrative
--
a
very
variable
relief
in
extensions
of
time.
we
were
able
successfully
to
obtain
administratively
extensions
of
time
which
completely
eliminated
any
liquidated
damages
which
were
about
to
be
assessed
against
the
company.
we
also
obtained
enough
extensions
that
the
money
which
had
been
retained,
the
retained
percentage
under
the
contract
was
released
and
we
got
that.
what
we
could
not
get
--
we
were
proceeding
as
if
--
you
have
to
under
article
9
to
get
the
extensions.
but
they
would
not
give
us
any
monetary
damages
because
it
simply
is
not
provided
and
under
the
normal
procedure
which
was
existent
then
and
still
is
you
have
to
go
to
the
court
of
claims.
now
that
raises
the
very
basic
issue
here
and
i'm
going
to
depart
what
i
think
would
be
--
from
what
i
think
would
be
a
normal
presentation
to
raise
immediately
so
that
the
court
might
understand
our
future
--
our
following
points
in
proper
context.
we
want
to
point
out
what
we
believe
to
be
and
i
think
i
expressed
the
--
in
this
respect,
the
feeling
of
the
government
contract
bar
of
the
nation,
a
staggering
proportions
of
the
government's
proposal
in
this
case.
it's
expressed,
i
think
at
page
49
of
their
brief,
they
say
in
some
of
the
administrative
practice
like
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
claims
does
not
preclude
on
application
of
the
bianchi
decision
to
require
administrative
submission
of
factual
disputes
underlying
claims
against
the
government
for
breach
of
contract.
and
that
was
expressed
yesterday
by
counsel
for
the
government
when
he
said
that
the
disputes
clause,
i
think
i
am
quoting
almost
verbatim
as
i
noted
it
down,
"the
disputes
clause
makes
the
agency
the
trier
of
all
of
the
facts
that
may
arise."
the
grotesqueness
though
if
the
position
is
that
they
stopped
there,
both
the
brief
and
the
argument
and
the
important
thing
of
course
would
be
on
the
practical
application.
they
stopped
there.
they
do
not
suggest
that
the
agency
or
the
administrative
board
has
any
jurisdiction
to
make
determinations
or
to
grant
relief.
in
fact
they
concede
and
it
was
conceded
in
an
answer
to
a
question
yesterday
that
you
still
--
we
would
still
have
to
file
in
the
court
of
claims
our
petition
but
then
it
stagnates
and
it
would
have
--
it
would
happen
under
their
theory
to
every
petition,
it
then
stops
and
you
go
back.
how?
i
don't
know.
to
whom?
they
haven't
told
you
but
they
say
you
go
back
to
the
agency
and
they
determine
the
facts.
but
clearly
we
think
they
would
create
of
these
agency
boards
plainly
legal
units.
they
would
receive
all
the
information.
they
would
literally
become
receptacles
for
information
because
the
issues
would
not
be
delineated.
there
would
be
no
power
to
act
on
relevancy.
they
would
simply
receive
the
facts.
that
is
what
their
briefs
said
and
that's
what
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
find
them,
yes,
you
are
right.
they
would
proceed
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
i
know
of
--
i
know
of
no
other
proceeding
your
honor
under
government
administrative
law
where
one
agency
determines
facts
under
one
proceeding
then
you
have
to
go
over
to
another
agency
under
another
proceeding
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
well,
i
would
have
to
say
that
i'm
not
familiar
enough
with
that
to
engage
in
a
--
in
an
extended
discussion.
i
am
not
aware
as
of
now
that
the
line
is
that
clear
cut
but
that
is
what
would
happen
here.
the
court
of
claims
alone
would
retain
the
jurisdiction
because
of
the
statutory
to
make
the
determinations
and
to
provide
the
remedy.
now
may
i
conjure
up
for
a
moment
what
would
happen
if
this
should
be
declared
to
be
the
law?
the
reason,
the
logic
for
providing
a
disputes
clause
and
a
--
an
administrative
hearing
under
a
construction
contract
was
to
provide
for
the
contractor
first
place
to
keep
the
job
going,
essential
government
work
and
the
quid
pro
quo
for
that
was
that
the
contractor
was
given
theoretically
a
prompt
and
expeditious,
a
speedy
manner
of
receiving
an
equitable
adjustment
that
that
will
disappear
completely.
this
court
in
its
--
in
your
decision
on
the
bianchi
case
made
reference
to
eliminating
duplication,
trying
as
far
as
possible
to
stop
long
grown-up
proceedings
which
would
be
repetitive.
this
contention
of
the
government
in
our
proceeding
would
make
it
absolutely
necessary
that
these
speedy
expeditious
administrative
hearings
be
converted
into
very
technical,
very
long-drawn-out
trials.
because
if
you
have
the
--
if
a
contractor
or
his
counsel
had
the
slightest
hope
of
eventually
recovering
anything,
you
would
be
bound
since
this
would
be,
as
they
express
it,
your
only
bite
of
the
apple.
you
would
be
bound
in
every
such
proceeding
to
present
all
of
your
evidence
including
the
details
of
the
evidence
on
things
that
is
complicated
as
the
type
of
damages.
and
the
method
and
the
measure
of
damages
which
are
involved
in
claims
such
as
we
present.
and
all
of
these
necessarily
would
have
to
be
done
on
the
administrative
agency
because
you
would
not
yet
have
drawn
for
you
by
anybody
with
any
authority
the
lines,
the
guidelines,
the
scope
of
the
proceeding
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
no,
your
honor,
i
am
decidedly
not
in
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
but
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
that
in
your
opinion
in
the
bianchi
case,
you
were
very
careful.
and
the
court
of
claims
in
its
consideration
of
our
case
was
exceedingly
careful.
reference
was
made
yesterday
to
the
fact
that
that
since
your
bianchi
decision,
the
court
of
claims
has
been
gnawing
at
it.
we
did
not
find
that
to
be
true
in
our
case.
from
the
very
outset,
the
commissioner,
trial
commissioner
bernhardt
said
to
us
before
we
go
into
anything
else,
we
want
you
to
develop
for
us
the
application
of
the
bianchi
decision.
immediately
we
pointed
out
to
them
the
paragraphs
in
your
bianchi
decision
and
we
think
these
are
the
pertinent
ones
in
which
you
said
on
these
precise
words,
respondent
bianchi
has
not
argued
in
this
court
that
the
underlying
controversy
in
the
present
suit
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
disputes
clause
in
the
contract
but
we
do
argue
that
here
and
i
think
there
is
no
answer
to
it.
you
then
went
on
and
you
said,
and
this
was
the
court
--
your
court's
conclusion,
“we
hold
only,
we
hold
only
and
in
its
consideration
of
matters
within
the
scope
of
the
disputes
clause
on
the
present
case,
the
court
of
claims
is
confined
to
a
review
of
the
administrative
record."
as
we
read
the
decision
and
we
do
not
mean
to
be
presumptive
but
we
have
attempted
to
advise
our
clients
and
we
advised
both
commissioner
bernhardt
and
the
court
of
claims
of
our
interpretation.
we
felt
that
that
plain
language
in
your
decision
consciously
and
expressly
drew
the
line
between
those
disputes
which
were
under
the
disputes
clause
and
those
which
are
beyond
it.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
that
is
correct.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
that's
right.
it
was
much
more
aggravated
than
that.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
but
that
is
the
general
and
that
is
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
that
is
correct.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
that
is
correct.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
yes,
we
have
to
do
that
your
honor
and
that's
exactly
--
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
which
we
have
filed
with
you,
that
is
exactly
what
the
government
representatives
determined
for
us
at
every
stage
of
the
administrative
proceeding,
the
view
which
is
expressed
here
in
the
brief
and
which
was
orally
expressed
yesterday
is
a
complete
and
absolute
repudiation
of
the
position
which
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
government
took
at
every
stage
of
the
proceeding
and
so
that
we
might
not
be
in
the
position
of
quibbling.
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
we
printed
for
you
a
photographic
copy
of
a
motion
which
they
made
to
dismiss,
to
request
the
dismissal
of
one
of
the
very
claims
that
we
are
talking
about
here
and
it
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
they
said
in
that
motion,
everything
that
they
now
deny.
they
said
the
contractor's
claim
is
a
claim
for
damages,
for
breach
of
contract
or
breach
of
warranty.
they're
speaking
of
the
aggregates
claim.
secondly,
the
disputes
clause
of
the
subject
contract
limits
the
hearing
examiner's
jurisdiction
to
disputes
concerning
questions
of
fact
arising
under
this
contract.
third,
a
claim
for
damages
for
breach
of
contract
or
breach
of
warranty
is
not
a
dispute
concerning
a
question
of
fact
arising
under
the
contract.
and
lastly,
the
contractor's
claim
may
not
be
recognized
as
a
claim
for
an
equitable
adjustment.
those
are
the
contentions
which
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
no,
your
honor
we
are
not,
not
at
all.
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
we
cite
that
only
as
demonstrative
of
the
government
position
which
was
taken
not
only
in
this
case
but
for
more
than
30
years
since
the
disputes
clause
has
been
in
effect.
not
only
the
administrative
factors
of
the
atomic
energy
advisory
committee
or
board
on
contract
appeals
but
practically
all
of
the
other
governmental
agencies
held
without
any
exception
taken
that
position,
that
has
been
the
administrative
practice
history.
when
this
contract
was
entered
into,
that
was
the
prevailing
view.
counsel
suggested
yesterday
that
not
until
the
bianchi
decision,
had
the
court
of
claims
ever
expressed
or
as
he
used
the
term
focused
upon
the
arising
under
the
contract
distinction.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
any
study
of
the
decisions
of
the
administrative
practice
as
well
of
the
court
of
claims
will
show
that
for
30
years
they
took
the
position
expressed
in
that
motion.
and
we
referred
you
in
our
brief
to
the
contract
board's
decision
in
one
of
our
appeals,
appeal
number
91
in
which
the
appeal
board
and
its
finding,
and
this
is
at
page
9
of
our
brief,
the
appeals
board
in
one
of
our
claims
said,
“it
is
clear
in
the
light
of
the
board's
decision
on
the
appeal
of
clermont
construction
company
that
not
only
does
the
contractor's
appeal
on
the
issue
of
damages
raise
issues
solely
of
law,
but
that
this
dispute
is
a
--
as
to
a
matter
relating
to
and
not
one
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
that
particular
proceeding
your
honor
was
one
in
which
we
were
--
it
was
the
one
that
we
referred
as
modific
--
contract
modifications
number
17
to
22,
and
we
are
attempting
to
obtain
in
the
first
place
an
extension
of
time,
and
secondly,
monetary
damages.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
yes
sir.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
not
the
--
not
your
honor
on
claims
of
the
type
that
we
are
raising
in
our
petition.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
oh,
i
think
that
is
not
correct.
i
have
here
the
original
decision
which
i
picked
out
on
my
file
on
the
clermont
case
which
the
board
referred
to.
that
came
down
in
february
14th
of
1955,
some
months
before
we
went
to
the
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
yes.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
yes.
i
think
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
well,
as
to
the
claims
that
i
am
referring
to
on
which
we
are
--
for
which
we
are
seeking
recovery
on
this
petition,
there
is
no
doubt,
i
think,
that
the
boards
did
not
pass
upon
them
as
is
indicated
by
the
decision
that
i
just
referred
to
--
you
to.
they
held
that
we
were
not
entitled
to
a
hearing.
they
did
the
same
thing
when
the
counsel
objected
at
the
administrative
hearing
the
minute
we
would
start
presenting
evidence
which
they
thought
related,
which
the
government
thought
related
to
a
claim
for
breach
of
contract.
they
would
interpose
an
objection
and
whereupon
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
and
that's
where
we
are
denied
due
process
of
law
because
we
were
denied
any
hearing
and
have
by
the
decisions
been
denied
and
the
hearing
as
to
the
aspects
of
our
claims
which
are
clearly
breach
of
contract.
