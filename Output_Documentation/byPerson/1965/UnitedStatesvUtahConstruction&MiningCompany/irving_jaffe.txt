mr.
irving
jaffe
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
primarily
two
issues.
one
deals
with
the
scope
of
the
disputes
clause
and
that
is
whether
or
not
that
clause
requires
submission
of
all
disputes
concerning
questions
of
fact
to
agency
determination.
we
believe
that
that
issue
was
not
covered
in
the
bianchi
decision.
the
second
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
fact
determinations
concededly
made
by
an
agency
under
the
disputes
clause
and
concededly
final
under
the
wunderlich
act,
a
binding
on
the
parties
and
on
the
courts
for
all
purposes
or
may
the
same
facts
be
tried
and
determined
de
novo
by
the
court
if
deemed
relevant
to
a
breach
of
contract
action
allegedly
outside
the
scope
of
the
disputes
clause.
we
believe
that
that
issue
has
been
decided
by
the
bianchi
decision
of
this
court.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
pertinent
only
to
the
extent
that
they
illustrate
the
legal
arguments
that
will
be
made.
suffice
it
to
say
that
this
case
concerned
a
contract
which
was
entered
into
in
1953
for
the
construction
of
an
aircraft
nuclear
reactor
project
in
the
state
of
idaho.
during
the
course
of
performance
of
this
contract,
several
disputes
arose,
many
of
them
were
--
well,
and
they
were
submitted
to
the
agency
for
determination,
some
were
favorably
acted
upon,
some
unfavorably.
four
of
these
disputes,
all
of
which
had
been
submitted
to
the
agency
before
are
in
--
present
in
this
court.
each
of
those
claims
are
presented
in
the
same
manner
as
they
were
presented
administratively.
two
--
three
of
them
at
least
include
damages
for
delays.
the
fourth
one
was
not
conceded
by
the
board
because
it
was
deemed
to
be
untimely.
that
too
was
a
claim
for
damages
for
delays.
there
is
added
in
the
petition
however,
an
overall
claim
for
delays
damages
allegedly
resulting
from
the
interaction
of
each
of
these
four
specific
matters.
now,
if
we
look
at
the
disputes
clause
itself,
we
find
that
its
language
is
apparently
clear.
the
pertinent
phrase
of
that
clause
says,
“all
disputes
concerning
questions
of
fact
arising
under
this
contract
shall
be
decided
by
the
contracting
officer.”
mr.
irving
jaffe
we
have
that
on
page
3
of
our
brief
or
page
4
--
just
a
moment.
it
appears
on
page
6
of
our
brief,
excuse
me,
on
page
6
of
our
brief,
subject
to
appeal
and
the
decision
shall
be
final.
the
court
of
claims
however,
in
construing
the
phrase
arising
under
the
contract
reads
that
clause
as
though
it
read
all
disputes
concerning
questions
of
fact
arising
under
other
clauses
of
this
contract
in
which
the
granting
of
relief
is
specifically
authorized
shall
be
decided
by
the
contracting
officer,
etcetera.
i
might
also
point
out
that
the
clause
itself
begins
with
the
words
except
as
otherwise
specifically
provided
in
this
contract,
all
disputes
shall
be
decided
by
the
contracting
officer.
the
court
seemingly
says,
“only
as
otherwise
specified
in
this
contract
shall
the
contracting
officer
be
authorized
to
decide
disputes.”
we
believe
as
a
practical
matter,
certainly,
the
disputes
clause
ought
to
read
in
a
manner
in
which
the
word
says,
that
is
all
disputes
arising
under
the
contract.
this
clause
is
the
only
one,
as
you
will
notice,
which
requires
that
the
contracting
--
the
contractor
shall
proceed
diligently
with
the
work
during
the
resolution
of
the
dispute
and
until
it
is
resolved.
if
--
as
the
court
of
claims
contends,
there
are
some
disputes
that
are
outside
the
scope
of
the
disputes
clause,
there
is
no
provision
on
the
contract
that
would
require
the
work
to
continue
while
the
dispute
was
resolved.
conceivably,
the
contractor
did
say,
that
this
dispute
between
me
and
you
mr.
contracting
officer
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
disputes
clause.
it's
going
to
be
costly
for
me
to
continue
as
you
direct
and
since
it's
outside
the
clause,
i'm
going
to
stop
working,
go
to
court
and
find
out
which
of
us
is
right.
now,
the
fact
is
that
that
has
never
been
done,
which
i
consider
or
at
least
i
have
no
knowledge
that
it
has
been
done.
and
i
consider
that
a
factor
to
show
that
the
contractors
themselves
had
never
construed
this
clause
as
being
limited
only
to
certain
types
of
disputes.
but
there's
another
reason
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
your
honor,
if
your
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
if
your
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
mr.
justice
white,
i
do.
i
disagree
with
that
and
i
think
that
i
will
be
able
to
show
or
i
think
i
could
demonstrate
now
that
the
historical
treatment
of
the
disputes
clause
has
not
created
such
a
firmly
rooted
or
firmly
entrenched
judicial
or
administrative
course
of
conduct
which
would
in
any
way
foreclose
this
court
from
examining
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
that
is
one
of
the
reasons.
the
district
courts
and
the
federal
courts
have
not
so
construed
the
clauses
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
the
district
courts
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
under
$10,000
and
while
they
don't
have
anywhere
near
the
same
number
of
cases
or
those
involving
as
large
amount
of
money.
they
do
have
these
cases
with
some
degree
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
oh
no,
i
don't
suggest
that
the
court
of
claims
hasn't
--
has
done
that.
i
do
suggest
however
that
when
the
court
of
claims
treated
with
this
subject,
they
were
treating
with
it
under
misconceptions
of
the
law
and
in
two
circumstances
the
rationale
that
they
used
was
rejected
by
this
court.
in
other
words,
we
do
not
have
an
ancient
practice.
i
think
that
we
will
show
that
the
bianchi
decision
itself
is
the
first
reason
for
the
court
to
focus
on
the
arising
under
because
prior
to
the
bianchi
decision,
the
court
of
claims
tried
all
cases
de
novo
whether
it
was
a
breach
of
contract
claim
or
whether
it
was
an
arising
under
claim
as
they
conceive
that
clause.
so
i
believe
that
until
the
bianchi
decision,
which
is
only
approximately
three
years
ago,
we
cannot
look
at
the
practice
that
that
was
engaged
in
then
as
foreclosing
any
further
examination
of
this
subject.
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes
i
shall.
if
you
like,
i
will
discuss
it
now.
mr.
irving
jaffe
only
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
there
is
only
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
only
in
the
sense
that
it
might
have
been
characterized
as
a
pure
breach
of
contract.
actually,
most
breach
of
contract
claims
as
the
court
of
claims
would
define
it,
have
been
submitted
by
contractors
to
the
contracting
officers
and
to
the
board.
they
have
always
determined
as
they
did
in
this
case
and
as
you
thought
it
in
this
case,
submitted
--
delays
damages
claims
to
the
contracting
officer
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
pardon?
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
the
court
of
claims
says
they
are
not.
mr.
irving
jaffe
the
court
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
if
your
honor
please,
they
submitted
three
claims,
the
pier
drilling
claim,
for
example,
asked
for
excess
cost
in
the
sum
of
$17,000
and
damages
due
to
the
delays
(inaudible)
by
the
problems
in
the
pier
drilling,
for
going
into
the
winter
months
for
$83,000.
now
in
the
court
of
claims,
they
asked
for
the
same
$17,000
and
instead
of
asking
for
$83,413.46,
they
asked
for
$183,413.46.
they
merely
put
a
“1”
before
it.in
the
concrete
aggregate
claim,
they
claimed
and
were
paid
for
the
extra
sand,
the
extra
materials,
general
supervision
and
a
margin
for
profit.
that's
not
in
either
place.
administratively,
that
claim
was
allowed.
they
then
asked
for
a
$109,000
some
odd
dollars
for
the
increase
cost
caused
by
the
delays.
now,
all
of
those
claims
that
is
except
for
the
concrete
which
was
held
untimely,
all
of
those
claims,
the
board
of
contract
appeal
said,
“our
jurisdiction
is
clear.”
now
if
this
is
going
to
be
a
situation
of
a
label,
then
i
will
admit
that
the
boards,
if
a
contractor
said
this
is
a
pure
breach
of
contract
or
a
pure
breach
of
warranty,
have
said
this
is
outside
the
scope
of
our
jurisdiction.
but
if
they
had
to
determine
the
facts
if
they
called
it
increased
cost
because
of
delays
are
being
thrown
into
the
wintered
months,
the
boards
have
always
determined
that
very
kind
and
type
of
fact
as
they
did
in
the
utah
case
here.
now
the
--
besides
of
which,
the
administrative
boards
whenever
they
did
say
that,
we
refer
to
one
place
in
our
brief
where
the
armed
services
board
of
contract
appeals
in
discussing
the
--
in
refusing
to
hear
what
they
considered
a
breach
claim
in
the
simmel-industrie
case
said,
decisions
by
the
court
of
claims
have
stated
that
it
was
not
bound
by
findings
of
fact
made
by
this
board
in
appeals
involving
breach
of
contract
claims.
we
cannot
in
good
conscience
compel
the
parties
to
undertake
the
great
expense
involved
in
presenting
this
matter
before
us
when
it
must
be
admitted,
then
our
decision
or
findings
of
fact
may
be
of
no
avail
to
either
party.
i
submit
that
the
board
--
of
boards
of
contract
appeals
have
sometimes
declined
to
entertain
what
they
recognized
as
a
breach
of
contract
claim
because
it
would
serve
no
purpose.
the
court
of
claims
would
try
it
all
over
again,
they
wanted
to
comply
with
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
claims.
in
many
instances,
they
thought
they
were
complying
with
this
court's
decisions
in
the
rice
case
and
the
crook
case
where
this
court
said
that
the
delayed
damages
clause
which
appears
as
a
standard
clause
in
most
contract
did
not
authorize
the
government,
not
the
board
but
even
the
courts
to
grant
any
damages
for
delay
because
that
clause
merely
provided
as
an
equitable
adjustment
and
extension
of
time
and
a
remission
or
non-imposition
of
the
liquidated
damages
stipulated
in
the
contract.
the
boards
have
frequently
said,
“you
are
asking
for
delay
damages,
and
under
the
rice
doctrine
or
the
crook
case,
we
can't
give
you
any
and
nobody
else
can.so
therefore,
we
won't
hear
it.”
so,
i
do
not
believe
that
there
was
any
firmly
established
judicial
or
administrative
course
of
conduct
which
would
not
allow
this
clause
in
the
contract
to
be
read
now
as
the
government
contends,
it
speaks
plainly
and
as
it
should
be
read.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
words
arising
under
is
not
peculiar
or
unique
in
this
contract.
the
words
arising
under
are
used
as
a
base
for
federal
jurisdiction
for
example,
district
court
jurisdiction,
when
you
talk
about
a
case
arising
under
a
federal
law.
now
that
has
been
construed
to
be
satisfied
if
rights
or
obligations
are
created
or
controlled
by
a
federal
law
and
then
if
one
comes
into
court
to
either
establish
the
--
those
rights
or
to
complain
of
a
violation
of
those
rights
or
obligations
the
federal
court
has
jurisdiction.
i
see
no
reason
why
the
clause
in
the
disputes
clause
should
be
read
any
differently.
the
contract
governs
the
rights
and
the
obligations
of
the
parties
and
if
there
was
a
violation
of
those
rights
or
if
there
was
a
need
to
enforce
one
of
those
rights,
there
is
no
warrant
for
saying
that
that
is
not
a
matter
which
arises
under
the
contract
in
the
same
manner
that
any
right
or
obligation
arising
under
a
federal
law
for
jurisdictional
purposes
isn't
equally
affected.
mr.
irving
jaffe
if
your
honor
please,
there
are
questions
of
fact
--
many
questions
of
fact
that
have
been
decided
in
the
case
before
us
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
--
by
the
board.
there
may
very
well
be
other
facts
which
may
have
to
be
decided
which
have
not
yet
been
decided.
mr.
irving
jaffe
now
if
there
are
questions
of
law
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
--
the
boards
of
course
will
decide
those
questions
of
law.
the
courts
however
are
not
bound
by
the
decision
on
the
question
of
law,
there's
no
finality.
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes.
mr.
irving
jaffe
no.
mr.
irving
jaffe
oh
well,
let
me
–
let
me
answer
that
this
way.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
i'm
speaking
--
i
should
be
speaking
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
i
should
be
speaking
about
disputes
concerning
questions
of
fact.
the
only
reason
that
that
now
says
disputes
concerning
questions
of
fact
whereas
sometimes
the
clause
says
disputes
concerning
questions
and
in
former
days
they
said
before
the
wunderlich
act,
it's
more
frequently
said
all
disputes
concerning
--
all
disputes
arising
under
this
contract
with
the
passage
of
the
wunderlich
act,
the
dropping
of
anything
or
the
use
of
the
word
fact
was
merely
intended
to
show
that
a
decision
on
a
question
of
law
would
not
be
final
because
this
disputes
clause
is
itself
a
finality
clause
as
much
as
it
is
a
jurisdictional
clause.
so
that
when
--
and
the
court
of
claims
incidentally
--
we're
not
at
odds
with
the
court
of
claims
on
the
question
of
law.
in
morrison-knudsen,
a
case
--
a
decision
which
they
handed
down
on
exactly
the
same
day
they
handed
down
the
grace
case.
the
court
of
claims
there
said
that
it
would
not
determine
whether
or
not
to
try
cases
de
novo
on
the
law
of
fact
dichotomy.
they
recognized
that
if
there
was
a
clause,
they
still
construed
this
arising
under
the
same
way,
that
if
there
was
another
clause
of
the
contract
which
authorize
the
examination
of
facts
and
the
determination
of
facts
by
the
board,
then
they
would
not
grant
the
trial
de
novo
and
would
accept
those
facts
as
found
even
though
it
underlay
primarily
a
question
of
law.
so
the
court
of
claims
itself
does
not
make
the
law
of
fact
dichotomy,
a
basis
for
determination
of
facts
either
by
the
court
or
by
the
agency.
so
we
have
--
we
don't
have
that
quarrel
even
with
the
court.
i
think
it
must
readily
be
understood
that
no
relief
could
be
granted
by
anyone
even
under
the
changes
article
which
no
one
disputes.
merely
upon
the
finding
of
facts,
the
granting
of
relief,
however
elementary
it
may
be,
involves
the
application
of
some
legal
principle
to
those
facts
in
order
to
say,
"you
are
entitled
to
so
many
dollars."
so
that
they
must
--
everyone
must
who's
granting
relief,
apply
legal
principles
and
determine
them.
now,
there
is
a
second
point
involved
in
this
case
which
is
embodied
in
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
--
of
judge
davis
of
the
court
of
claims.
that
point
concerns
the
finding
of
facts
properly
found
in
the
court
--
under
the
court
of
claims
interpretation
of
the
arising
under
clause,
in
connection
with
relief
which
the
board
might
have
--
might
have
granted.
the
court
now
says
however
that
when
those
same
facts
have
to
do
with
their
so-called
breach
of
contract
claim
that
it
will
determine
those
facts
de
novo
and
they
will
not
be
bound
by
the
facts
as
found
by
the
board.
judge
davis
dissents
on
the
ground
that
he
feels
that
that
--
the
disputes
clause,
the
wunderlich
act
and
the
decision
of
this
court
will
be
argued,
have
already
declared
that
any
facts
properly
so
found
are
binding
for
all
purposes.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
demonstrable
very
readily.
in
the
disputes
clause,
it
says
--
and
speaking
of
the
finality
aspect
of
the
clause,
it
says,
“whose
decision
shall
be
final
and
conclusive
upon
the
parties
thereto.”
in
other
words,
the
facts
found
by
him
which
withstand
the
test
of
the
wunderlich
act
and
in
the
--
this
case,
they
do
withstand
the
test
of
the
wunderlich
act
or
at
least
they
assume
it
for
the
purposes
of
their
decision.
if
finding
on
the
parties
that
at
a
certain
fact
that
now
exist,
which
the
parties
must
accept,
they
cannot
come
in
as
they
do
in
this
case
and
say
that
the
delays
which
the
government
found
for
60
days
let
us
say,
are
no
longer
60
days
for
any
purpose
but
an
extension
of
time
and
the
fact
that
i
can't
be
assessed
for
any
liquidated
damages
for
that
60-day
period.
we
now
come
into
the
court
as
the
majority
opinion
illustrates
and
says,
"we
now
claim
that
the
delay
was
120
days.
and
of
that
a
120
days,
we
believe
that
a
105
were
unreasonable
delays
caused
by
the
government
and
therefore,
we
want
damages
for
that
period
of
time."
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
davis
said
that
the
period
of
delays
found
by
the
board
were
necessary
for
them
in
order
to
determine
whether
they
give
an
extension
of
time.
and
in
considering
those
things,
the
delays
damages
article,
article
9
which
appears
in
our
brief
on
page
4,
beginning
on
page
4,
makes
--
delegates
the
contracting
officer
the
job
of
finding
out
the
courses
and
the
facts
of
delay
and
makes
those
final.
now
are
they
final
only
for
the
period
of
time
that
the
contract
may
be
extended
or
to
the
period
of
time
during
which
liquidated
damages
will
not
be
assessed,
or
does
it
actually
find
that
this
is
the
period
of
delay.
it
includes
delays
caused
by
the
government.
may
the
court
now
say,
“well,
the
contracting
officer
found
that
the
government
only
caused
60-days
delay.”
but
now
that
he
is
suing
for
damages
for
that
delay,
we
can
find
that
it
was
a
120
days,
and
try
all
the
facts
all
over
again.
neither
the
contract
nor
the
wunderlich
act
which
doesn't
speak
about
final
or
limited
purposes,
or
final
only
for
the
purpose
for
which
they
acted,
it
is
final
and
is
final
for
all
purposes,
we
think
that
is
self-evident.
one
other
thing
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize
is
that
this
court
has
ruled
that
this
arrangement,
this
contract
between
the
parties,
that
the
fact
finders,
the
triers
of
the
fact
shall
be
one
party
to
the
agreement
is
a
valid,
binding,
and
enforceable
agreement.
now,
we
ask
this
court
to
find
and
determine
that
the
disputes
clause
here
without
restriction
makes
the
agency,
to
trier
of
all
questions,
all
disputed
questions
concerning
a
question
of
fact
in
the
disputes
clause
which
we
urge
stands
on
its
own
feet,
not
related
to
any
other
clause
in
the
contract.
we
say
that
that
clause
makes
the
government
agency
the
trier
of
all
the
facts
that
may
arise
concerning
a
question
under
this
contract.
and
if
the
dispute
is
bottomed
upon
this
contract,
if
they
must
plead
this
contract
in
order
to
be
successful
in
the
course
of
action,
then
it
is
a
course
of
action
or
it
is
a
claim
or
a
dispute
arising
under
the
contract
and
any
question
concerning
that
dispute
must
be
tried
by
the
agency.
and,
the
only
thing
that
would
happen
if
the
agency
did
not
--
either
because
it
was
--
it
mistakenly
believed
it
had
no
jurisdiction,
if
as
this
court
said
in
bianchi,
if
the
record
is
insufficient,
if
it's
defective,
if
more
facts
are
needed,
then
the
trier
of
the
fact,
the
agency,
tries
them
and
it
goes
back
either
by
suspension
or
remand,
the
semantics
are
unimportant.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
thank
you.
mr.
irving
jaffe
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
do
not
understand
mr.
johnson
saying
that
he
was
denied
any
hearing.
he
received
a
full
and
complete
hearing
on
every
one
of
these
claims
and
every
one
of
which
incidentally
was
a
place
before
the
board.
and
in
each
one,
the
board
of
appeals
of
a
hearing
examiner
in
one
case
said
very
clearly
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
is
clear.
that
appears
on
the
record,
if
your
honor
please
with
respect
to
every
--
for
--
the
pier
drilling
claim
on
record
page
80
or
the
window
claim
on
record
page
182,
for
the
door
claim
on
page
122.
the
board
of
contract
appeals
had
no
doubt
that
they
had
cleared
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
the
concrete
aggregate
claim
where
the
contracting
officer
did
submit
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
basis
that
it
was
outside
the
jurisdiction.
that
motion
was
denied.
the
only
part
of
the
motion
that
was
granted
was
that
the
appeal
was
untimely.
the
contract
--
i
did
not
say
yesterday
nor
did
the
hearing
examiner
in
that
case
say
that
this
was
a
breach
of
warranty.
what
the
contracting
officer
--
what
the
hearing
examiner
rather
did
say
on
page
74
of
the
record
in
the
concrete
aggregate
claim
was
that
if
utah
is
arguing
that
this
is
a
breach
of
warranty,
then
it
is
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
this
proceeding.
then
he
went
on
to
say,
and
said
suffice
it
to
say
however,
utah
rests
its
case
upon
the
change
conditions
clause.
and
that
was
his
holding
and
then
that
it
was
untimely.
incidentally,
this
argument
or
this
dispute,
the
question
that
arises
in
connection
with
the
application
of
the
disputes
clause
is
in
my
opinion
largely
a
matter
of
semantics.
when
we
speak
of
breach
of
warranty,
we're
not
invoking
any
magic
language.
every
change
condition
which
is
in
the
contract
is
in
one
sense
a
breach
of
warranty.
everytime
a
contractor
asks
for
a
change
order
because
something
additional
has
been
asked
of
him,
there's
a
reformation
of
the
contract,
whenever
the
government
decides
either
for
its
convenience
or
otherwise
that
the
contract
ought
to
be
terminated,
there's
a
rescission
of
the
contract.
these
words
don't
raise
any
magic
legal
theories
that
are
outside
the
scope
of
the
disputes
clause
or
is
not
a
proceeding
or
a
situation
which
does
not
arise
under
the
contract.
the
contractor
here
didn't
think
that
it
did.
he
presented
everyone
of
this
so-called
breach
of
contract
claims
to
the
board
and
the
board
considered
each
one
of
them.
and
in
each
case,
they
had
detailed,
full,
complete
hearings
except
in
the
one
where
it
was
untimely.
and
even
there,
there
was
extensive
argument.
and
even
there,
facts
were
found.
and
what
are
the
facts
that
need
to
be
found
for
this
so-called
breach
of
contract?
the
causes
of
delay,
the
fact
of
delay,
whether
it's
the
government's
fault,
whether
it's
the
contractor's
fault,
are
these
causes
beyond
the
control
of
the
contractor,
are
they
within
the
control
of
the
government?
these
are
the
facts
which
underlie
a
so-called
breach
of
contract
for
delays
and
those
things
are
specifically
committed
by
article
9
of
the
contract
which
appears
in
our
brief,
on
page
--
bottom
of
page
4.
what
do
they
find
out?
what
is
committed
to
this
contracting
officer?
it
says
that
the
contractor,
if
he's
met
with
any
delay,
shall
within
10
days
from
the
beginning
of
that
delay
notify
the
contracting
officer
who
shall
ask
of
the
causes
of
the
delay
is
what
he
notifies
him.
and
the
contracting
officer
shall
ascertain
the
facts
and
the
extent
of
the
delay.
then
of
course,
they
say
he
will
extend
the
time
not
imposed
the
liquidated
damages
that
the
contract
might
provide
for.
now
the
only
suggestion
that
has
been
made
and
i
see
no
rational
basis
for
it,
is
that
unless
another
clause
of
the
contract
says,
there's
no
question
that
all
of
these
are
breaches
whether
it's
--
the
only
thing
is,
is
that
is
there
were
clause
in
the
contract
which
says
that
the
contracting
officer
shall
make
an
equitable
adjustment.
now,
those
are
breaches
that
the
government
has
anticipated.
they
have
occurred
with
such
frequency
that
they
anticipate
those
breaches
and
they
therefore
provide
that
an
equitable
adjustment
shall
be
made.
however,
it's
not
this
contract
that
authorizes
the
government
to
pay.
the
government
has
given
the
money
and
authorized
to
pay
by
the
appropriation
act.
and
yet
this
court
holds,
as
i
believe
it
should,
that
every
disputed
question
arising
under
this
contract
is
one
within
the
scope
and
the
ages
of
this
proceeding
as
i
believe
it
is
then
the
money
will
be
paid
out
of
the
appropriations.
the
only
reason
it's
not
now
is
because
judicially,
not
by
contract,
it
has
been
said
that
there
--
the
--
that
it's
not
within
their
power.
that's
not
true.
they
pay
these
kinds
of
claims
all
the
time.
they
paid
utah
for
a
type
of
breach
of
contract
claim.
they
paid
them
for
general
supervision,
profit.
those
are
the
things
that
go
into
the
delay
claims.
on
the
concrete
aggregate,
they
paid
that.
they
paid
every
cent
he
asked
for
which
included
claims
which
were
not
excess
cost.
now
in
this
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
i
do.
i
do
because
the
parties
agreed
as
clearly
as
i
think
that
they
could
have
that
the
trier
of
the
facts
would
be
the
contracting
officer
or
the
head
of
the
department
or
his
delegate,
the
court
of
appeals.
now
it
is
not
this
vacuum
that
mr.
johnson
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
they
have
in
the
disputes
clause.
that
all
disputed
questions
of
fact
concerning
--
that
is
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
--
all
disputes
concerning
the
question
of
facts.
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes.
mr.
irving
jaffe
yes.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
i'm
not
--
i
don't
agree
that
he
can't.
i
say
that
he
can.
and
this
is
not
a
vacuum.
he
doesn't
merely
find
facts
and
say,
“now,
i
don't
know
what
to
do
with
them.”
he
finds
the
facts,
determines
liability
and
fixes
the
amount.
now,
what
this
court
says
they
do
that
under
all
disputes,
they
will
be
paid
in
the
same
manner
that
these
claims
are
paid.
the
only
possibility
maybe
that
the
appropriation
has
run
out,
that
would
be
no
different
than
a
judgment
in
the
court
of
claims
or
a
judgment
anywhere
where
the
amount
was
over
$100,000.
the
person
who
gets
the
judgment
will
have
to
wait
for
congress
to
make
the
routine
appropriation.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
they
--
well,
i
can't
answer
that.
i
think
that
everything
is
within
--
they've
presented
these
claims
administratively.
they
presented
these
claims
including
what
he
now
calls
breach
of
contract.
he
detailed
the
concrete
aggregate
claim
of
$109,356.
that
claim
was
presented.
if
he
calls
it
a
breach
of
contract
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
then
the
pier
drilling
--
the
--
well,
because
it
was
untimely
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
i
know.
mr.
irving
jaffe
that
was
because
it
was
untimely
rather
than
because
they
said
he
had
that
jurisdiction
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
they
can
go
back
to
the
board
for
the
ascertainment
of
the
question
on
the
merits.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
the
--
you
mean
that
the
--
do
you
mean
at
the
court
level?
mr.
irving
jaffe
that
he
filed
it
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
contract
was
over.
that
was
the
only
reason.
that
was
the
only
reason
that
was
upheld.
the
contracting
officer
and
of
course
statements
of
counsel
on
that
evidence
did
bring
in
many
of
the
grounds
which
were
not
sustained.
mr.
irving
jaffe
what
it
--
mr.
irving
jaffe
you
mean
at
the
administrative
level.
mr.
irving
jaffe
well,
the
--
it
wasn't
--
as
i
said
yesterday,
it
wasn't
unusual.
mr.
irving
jaffe
it
wasn't
--
well,
it
was
consistent
in
the
sense
that
that
position
had
been
taken
but
it
is
not
consistent
in
the
sense
that
beneath
the
contractor
and
all
the
boards,
and
all
the
administrators
ever
really
decline
taking
of
that
very
type
of
claim.
and
they
would
have
heard
it
here,
just
as
they've
heard
the
pier
drilling
claim
that
he
says
was
also
of
the
same
type.
they
heard
the
$83,000
claim
he
put
in,
in
addition
to
the
excess
cost.
mr.
irving
jaffe
on
that
score,
no,
there
is
none.
thank
you
your
honors.
