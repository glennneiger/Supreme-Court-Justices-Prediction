justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
judge
davis
below
said
that
the
--
there
was
a
–
historically,
quite
a
limitation
on
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
the
factual
disputes
--
there's
simply
factual
disputes
underlying
breach
claims
for
example,
just
automatically
wouldn't
be
found
--
wouldn't
be
decided
by
the
contracting
officer
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
said
it
was
just
too
late
to
--
for
the
government
to
contend
this,
i
gather
you
disagree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
--
except
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
the
only
--
which
is
about
the
only
court
that
has
anything
to
do
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not
suggesting
the
court
of
claims
has
ever
held
–
held
the
disputes
suppose
to
have
that
--
the
scope
you
suggest?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
going
to
talk
about
what's
the
administrative
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
wondered
--
i
gather
you
say
that
the
--
contracting
officers
have
not
regularly
rejected
breach
of
contract
claims
as
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
outside
the
clause
or
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
not
within
their
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
in
other
clauses
of
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
under
other
clauses
of
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
submission
utah
made
in
this
case
was
under
other
clauses,
was
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
say
that
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
because
certainly
some
of
the
--
some
of
the
--
some
of
the
claims
you
couldn't
make
within
the
contract
and
get
compensation
for
it,
there
wasn't
compensation,
they
would
be
breaches
of
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
because,
if
this
not
--
we
just
can't
say
it
any
blanket
way
that
breach
of
contract
claims
aren't
--
within
the
disputes
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
say
that
there
is
some
that
are
and
some
that
aren't.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
they're
really
they're
not
compensable
under
other
sections
of
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
--
but
that
doesn't
--
that's
really
what
you're
saying.
it
isn't
a
breach
of
contract
that
distinguishes
so
--
this
class
of
claim.
the
fact
that
you
get
that
--
that
there's
no
mechanism
under
the
contract
for
you
to
get
any
compensation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you'd
have
to
go
somewhere
else
anyway
to
have
the
matter
finally
settled.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
they
would
find
them,
they
would
find
the
fact.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
any
--
of
other
instances
in
administrative
practice
where
administrative
agencies
have
power
to
determine
facts
and
relative
to
money
awards
and
absolutely
no
power
to
make
--
give
an
enforceable
reward?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
about
reparations
award
before
the
icc?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
jaffe,
do
you
think
it's
essential
in
this
case
actually
to
face
up
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
--
whether
or
not
the
contracting
officer
must
pass
on
the
factual
underpinning
for
claims
which
a
contractor
might
make,
which
are
not
compensable
under
the
contract
in
the
sense
that
there
is
no
remedy
within
the
contract
provided.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
don't
agree
on
that
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
my
question.
i
understand
that
the
kind
of
a
reading
you
want
to
give
to
the
disputes
clause
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
i
understand
that
the
other
side
doesn't
agree
with
you
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
is
within
the
--
there
is
a
class
of
cases
i
suppose
for
which
the
contracting
officer
can
give
no
remedy
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
--
let
me
ask
you
this.
is
there
any
of
these
claims
which
was
presented
here,
which
was
not
specifically
within
one
of
the
other
clauses
of
the
contract,
do
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
nobody
suggests
that
one
has
been
adjudicated
by
anybody.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
mean,
(inaudible)
wasn't
adjudicated
by
anybody
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
not
even
the
commissioner
before
the
court
of
claims.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
alright,
if
there
(voice
overlap)
--
there's
nobody
ever
got
to
the
merits
of
the
claim
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
want
to
know
is
that
the
concrete
aggregate
claim
within
one
of
the
other
clauses
of
the
contract
that
the
contractor
could
actually
bring
up
an
--
why
did
the
government
object
to
presenting
that
evidence
about
that
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
it's
before
the
administrators.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
word
sustain
but
i
just
--
i'm
not
going
to
forget
that
the
government
took
that
position
and
why
did
they,
do
you
suppose
because
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
the
government
state
these
other
reasons
for
not
taking
up
that
claim
before
the
administrator?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that
it
was
a
kind
of
a
claim
that
the
administrator
shouldn't
be
deciding
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
this
is
a
--
that
the
government's
position
before
the
administrator
was
consistent
with
30
years
in
practice
enough.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
isn't
a
single
judge
on
the
court
of
claims
that
agrees
with
you,
isn't
it?
