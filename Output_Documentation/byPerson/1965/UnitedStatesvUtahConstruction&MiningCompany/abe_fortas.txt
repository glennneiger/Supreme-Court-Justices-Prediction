justice
abe
fortas
is
this
phrase
in
the
disputes
clause
--
or
you
--
concerning
all
disputes
--
concerning
questions
of
fact,
are
all
of
these
questions
of
fact
that
are
involved
here
--
are
there
some
questions
of
law?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
(voice
overlap)
yes,
my
question
is
the
other
one
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
that
sir,
but
if
this
is
looked
on
as
a
--
some
extension
or
a
contractual
matter,
does
this
clause
which
is
different
from
here
--
is
in
fact
different
from
the
one
in
the
preceding
case
we
had
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
does
this
clause
make
any
difference
in
your
view
with
respect
to
the
result
we
ought
to
reach?
justice
abe
fortas
--
because
it
seems
it
confine
jurisdiction
of
the
contracting
officer
who
disputes
the
concerning
questions
of
fact.
justice
abe
fortas
you've
been
talking
about
disputes
arising
under
the
contract
--
justice
abe
fortas
phrase
here.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
johnson
as
i
understand
you,
one
of
your
principle
claims
here
is
a
claim
for
damages
due
to
delays
attributable
to
the
government,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now
i
assume
that
what
you
have
in
mind
is
that
the
government
was
supposed
to
close
all
the
contractors
to
deliver
things
to
you
that
were
essential
to
the
progress
of
the
installation.
the
government
was
supposed
to
give
you
specifications
and
plans
and
that
sort
of
thing
which
the
government
did
not
perform
adequately
and
that
the
government
unreasonably
withheld
approvals
of
various
spaces
of
the
project,
that
kind
of
thing,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
care,
aggravated
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
principle,
that's
what
you're
talking
about.
justice
abe
fortas
and
now
you're
telling
us
that
that
type
of
controversy,
that
controversy
is
to
whether
the
government
did
or
did
not
do
that
kind
of
thing
is
not
under
the
disputes
clause,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
disputes
clause
says
--
covers
all
disputes
concerning
questions
of
fact
arising
under
this
contract,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now
don't
you
have
to
establish
that
these
questions
that
i've
been
putting
to
you
do
not
involve
disputes
--
do
not
involve
--
that
these
issues
do
not
involve
questions
of
fact
arising
under
this
contract
in
order
to
take
it
out
of
the
disputes
clause
and
therefore
to
take
it
out
of
bianchi.
justice
abe
fortas
is
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
administrator?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you're
not
suggesting
that
statements
in
a
motion
to
dismiss,
the
lack
of
a
jurisdiction
providing
on
this
court,
are
you?
justice
abe
fortas
what
(inaudible)
--
what
was
the
issue
there?
justice
abe
fortas
what
was
the
issue
though,
its
--
this
is
addressed,
your
brief
doesn't
say?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
but
with
respect
to
this
matter
of
damages
for
delays
chargeable
to
the
government
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
contracting
officers
do
pass
on
those
all
the
time,
don't
they?
kind
of
claim
that
you
and
i
we're
discussing,
that
that
is
typically
the
kind
of
claim
that
is
centered
and
considered
by
the
agencies
themselves,
atomic
energy
commission,
the
military
boards
and
so
on.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
talking
about
this
specific
claim,
damages
for
delays
chargeable
to
the
government.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
that
kind
of
claim.
i'm
talking
about
the
kind
of
claim
that
this
is
subject
to
the
colloquy
between
you
and
me
a
few
minutes
ago.
justice
abe
fortas
in
which
you
started
of
by
saying
is
one
of
the
important
claims
that
you're
making
here
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
for
comment
--
your
comment
based
on
your
knowledge
of
the
literature,
your
experience
is
that
that
is
typically
the
kind
of
claim
on
which
the
agencies
themselves
passed.
justice
abe
fortas
did
the
--
my
trouble
with
this,
mr.
johnson
is
that
you
keep
talking
about
a
claim
for
breach
of
contract.
justice
abe
fortas
and
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
any
sort
of
a
dispute
that
might
arise.
that
isn't
a
claim
for
breach
of
contract.
the
question
is
the
specifics
of
these
specific
claims
even
if
you
assume
--
let's
assume
that
there
are
some
types
of
claims
and
breach
of
contract,
let's
say
presenting
pure
questions
of
law.
they
might
present
the
kind
of
an
issue
as
to
the
applicability
of
bianchi.
but
as
you
started
your
argument
here
this
morning
and
describe
these
claims,
it
sounded
to
me
as
if
--
while
they
are
claims
for
breach
of
contract,
there
are
also
claims
that
are
--
that
present
and
are
essentially
questions
of
fact
which
arise
under
the
contract
in
the
sense
of
requiring
interpretation
of
the
obligations
of
each
party
and
the
performance
or
nonperformance
by
the
government.
