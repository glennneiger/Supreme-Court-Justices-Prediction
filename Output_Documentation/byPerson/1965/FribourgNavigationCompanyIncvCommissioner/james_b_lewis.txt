mr.
james
b.
lewis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
this
case,
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit
presents
a
simple,
but
fundamental
question
of
how
depreciation
should
be
computed
for
income
tax
purposes.
ever
since
1913,
the
income
tax
statute
has
granted
us
a
deduction,
a
reasonable
allowance
for
the
exhaustion
wear
and
tear
of
property.
this
court
has
asked
in
this
case
to
interpret
that
42-year-old
statutory
language
on
this
issue
for
the
first
time.
the
facts
are
undisputed
and
maybe
quickly
stated.
the
taxpayer
purchased
in
december
of
1955,
one
of
the
old
world
war
ii
liberty
ships
for
$469,000
and
proceeded
to
use
that
ship
in
its
shipping
business
as
a
tramp
steamer.
before
making
the
purchase,
the
commissioner
came
down
the
--
the
taxpayer
came
down
to
washington,
and
asked
the
commissioner
for
a
ruling
on
depreciation
and
received
such
a
ruling.
the
commissioner,
having
experience
in
this
field,
rule
that
this
liberty
ship
was
to
be
depreciated
over
a
three-year
useful
life
that
the
amount
to
be
depreciated
was
the
$469,000
cost
plus
a
salvage
value
based
on
scrap
of
$5
a
dead-weight
ton
or
$54,000.
and
that
the
depreciable
amount
$415,000
was
to
be
written
off
over
the
three-year
useful
life
under
the
straight-line
basis,
one-third
each
year.
the
taxpayer
followed
the
ruling
letter
meticulously.
a
year
later,
something
happen
that
no
one
could
have
expected,
the
suez
canal
crisis
erupted.
the
canal
was
blocked
for
about
six
months.
and
when
it
reopened,
it
reopened
under
egyptian
management
that
many
people
then
had
limited
confidence
in.
during
this
brief
crisis,
the
prices
of
all
kinds
of
ships
even
liberty
ships
rose
spectacularly
because
the
necessity
of
going
around
africa
caused
a
brief,
but
severe,
shipping
crisis.
during
1957,
all
of
1957
except
the
last
eight
days,
the
taxpayer
operated
its
ship,
produced
a
gross
profit
from
that
operation
of
almost
$300,000
and
filed
an
income
tax
return
on
which
disclosed
that
profit
and
deducted
there
from
its
expenses
including
the
depreciation
of
about
$135,000
that
had
been
authorized
in
the
ruling
letter.
the
taxpayer
had
a
substantial
net
profit
for
1957
roughly
$140,000
from
the
operation
of
this
and
a
less
important
ship.
having
received
and
unsolicited
and
attractive
offer
from
a
competitor
during
the
suez
crisis,
the
taxpayer
sold
the
liberty
ship
in
december
of
1957
for
the
price
of
about
$695,000.
mr.
james
b.
lewis
for
two
years.
the
dispute
here
arises
from
the
commissioner's
total
disallowance
of
depreciation
for
the
ship
for
1957.
the
commissioner
asserts
that
the
depreciation,
which
he
concedes,
to
have
been
correctly
established
by
the
ruling
letter
was
nevertheless
the
automatically
disallowed
for
one
reason
only
because
the
sale
of
the
ship
produced
a
profit.
mr.
james
b.
lewis
yes.
his
argument
on
trade
fair
is
that
he
here
is
that
he
will
not
touch
and
should
not
touch
the
depreciation
allowed
for
the
years
prior
to
the
year
of
sale.
now,
although
this
was
the
first
time
that
this
narrow
but
significant
issue
has
been
presented
to
this
court,
the
court
is
not
being
asked
to
write
on
a
clean
slate.
year
after
years
since
1913,
hundreds
and
probably
thousands
of
taxpayers
every
year
have
sold
some
sort
of
depreciable
property.
they
have
reported
their
gain
or
loss
on
the
sale.
they
have
taken
their
depreciation
for
the
year
in
which
the
sale
occurred.
their
returns
have
been
subject
to
audit
and
their
returns
have
been
audited.
and
one
has
only
to
turn
to
the
precedents
to
find
out
what
the
practice
was
and
it
was
uniform
or
as
uniformed
as
a
practice
that
affects
thousands
of
taxpayers
every
year
can
be.
depreciation
was
regularly
allowed
for
the
year
of
sale
regardless
of
whether
the
sale
was
a
gain
or
a
loss.
and
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
to
say
--
well,
a
precedent,
that
reflects
this
fairly
established
administrative
policy.
we
have
cited
five
early-published
rulings.
more
than
35
court
cases,
five
of
which
reached
this
court
and
all
of
which
the
record
shows
without
dispute
the
amount
of
depreciation
taken
for
the
year
of
sale.
mr.
james
b.
lewis
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
was
saying
that
35
or
40
court
decisions
discussed
in
our
two
briefs
reflect
clearly
the
consistent
allowance
of
depreciation
for
the
year
of
sale
of
an
asset
at
a
profit.
five
of
those
cases
reached
this
court
obliquely
because
generally
a
taxpayer
will
accept
an
allowance
that
the
commissioner
has
made
instead
of
rejecting
it.
so
there
is
not
an
abundance
of
direct
of
adjudication
on
this
issue
prior
to
the
last
two
or
three
years.
but
the
case
is
nevertheless
reflected
the
consistent
administrative
policy.
this
court
had
such
a
case
in
1921.
it
had
such
a
case
in
1927,
the
ludey
case.
it
had
such
a
case
in
1947,
the
beulah
crane
against
commissioner
in
which
the
commissioner
allowed
mrs.
crane's
$3200
of
year
of
sale
depreciation
on
her
building.
and
this
court
approved
the
commissioner's
computation
of
profit
on
sale
by
subtraction
of
that
year
of
sale
depreciation.
the
court
had
a
group
of
such
cases
in
1960
and
the
massey,
evans,
and
hertz
decisions
in
which
the
commissioner
allowed
depreciation
in
the
year
of
sale
of
automobiles
at
a
profit.
nevertheless,
adjudication
did
arise,
first,
because
a
taxpayer
cannot
always
use
his
depreciation
deduction.
if
he
has
an
access
of
other
deductions,
he
may
prefer
not
to
take
his
depreciation
and
to
keep
the
basis
of
his
property
high,
so
as
to
reduce
the
capital
gain
that
he
otherwise
has
to
report
at
the
25%
rate.
this
occurred
to
herbert
simons.
and
in
1930,
in
a
board
of
tax
appeals
decision,
the
commissioner
argued,
“mr.
simons,
you
must
take
your
year
of
sale
depreciation
even
though
you
cannot
use
it
because
otherwise,
the
system
of
allocating
part
of
your
cost
of
the
asset
to
the
part
used
up
during
its
life,
the
system
will
be
destroyed.
and
we
will
not
have
either
a
correct
reflection
of
depreciation
or
a
correct
reflection
of
gain
on
sale.”
and
the
board
of
tax
appeals
says,
“the
commissioner
is
absolutely
right”.
this
is
what
we
have
always
held
and
this
is
what
the
courts
have
always
held.
throughout
this
long
history
and
i'm
talking
now
about
1913
to
1960,
47
years,
there
are
two
isolated
cases
of
taxpayer
contests
of
disallowances
of
year
of
depreciation
by
the
commissioner.
now
of
course
with
a
widely
separated
administration,
this
can
happen
now
and
then.
but
on
an
issue
involved
in
thousands
of
returns
annually,
we
find
two
contests
in
47
years.
both
of
these
cases
resulted
in
clear
holdings
by
the
tax
court
that
the
depreciation
was
allowable.
in
1927
decision,
duncan-homer
and
the
1947
decision
weir
long
leaf,
both
cases
depreciation
was
clearly
allowable
for
the
year
of
profitable
sale.
the
commissioner
promptly
acquiesced
in
the
weir
case
in
1948,
and
that
equity
essence
was
outstanding
until
the
middle
of
1962
when
this
case
was
already
in
the
courts.congress
in
1950
included
in
its
committee
report
on
the
1950
revenue
act,
a
clear
example
of
the
taking
of
depreciation
on
an
asset
for
the
year
of
its
profitable
sale
and
a
reporting
of
capital
gain
on
the
sale
of
that
asset.
the
commissioner
incorporated
this
committee
report
into
the
--
or
the
treasury,
incorporated
it
into
the
treasury
regulations
and
it
was
there
from
1951,
republished
in
1953,
again
republished
in
1957,
and
it
stayed
there
until
june
of
this
year
when
the
commissioner
decided
it
was
too
embarrassing
and
withdrew
it.
the
commercial
accounting
practice
is
exactly
to
the
same
effect
as
we've
pointed
out
clearly
in
our
briefs,
clearly
supports
the
tax
practice.
and
here,
there
is
not
an
scintilla
of
reason
for
creating
any
divergences
between
commercial
accounting
and
tax
accounting
for
as
this
court
said
and
its
latest
depreciation
decision,
the
massey
case
in
1960,
the
purpose
of
the
commercial
accounting
and
tax
accounting
systems
here
is
harmonious.
they
have
the
common
function
of
achieving
a
proper
reflection
of
net
income.
now
during
the
period,
that
all
of
precedent
accumulated
1913
to
1960,
congress
re-enacted
the
depreciation
provision,
12
times.
repeatedly,
congress
addressed
itself
in
these
12
revenue
acts
and
codes
to
the
problem
of
how
depreciation
on
business
asset
and
capital
gain
or
loss
on
its
disposition
should
work.
again
and
again,
congress
changed
the
treatment
of
gain
or
loss
in
1921,
'32,
'38,
'42,
'47,
'50,
'51,
'54,
'62
and
'64.
again
and
again,
focusing
on
the
problem
we
have
here,
but
again
and
again,
in
each
of
the
12
enactments
and
each
of
it's
addresses
to
the
problem,
it
left
the
depreciation
provision
that
the
commissioner
had
always
interpreted
as
allowing
year
of
sale
depreciation
totally
unchanged,
the
basic
depreciation
words
today,
except
for
the
inclusion
of
the
word
obsolescence,
are
exactly
what
they
were
in
the
revenue
act
of
1913.
suddenly,
so
as
far
as
i
can
determine,
sometime
in
1960,
the
commissioner
privately
determine
that
he
would
like
to
wipe
the
slate
clean.
he
didn't
tell
us
this
until
1962.
in
june
of
that
year,
he
published
a
revenue
ruling
that
stated
that
now
he
did
not
want
to
allow
depreciation
for
the
year
of
profitable
sale.
but
since
our
case
was
docketed
in
the
tax
court
late
in
1960
and
from
such
other
evidence
as
i
can
find,
1960
or
about
the
middle
of
1960
was
the
time
of
the
change.
now,
when
this
change
occurred
in
1960,
there
were
no
cases
in
the
courts
involving
this
issue.
now
there
are
more
than
300.
the
commissioner
tries
in
his
brief
to
say
that
this
is
an
old
policies
following,
and
not
a
new
policy.
but
i
think
it's
enough
to
tell
you
that
there
were
no
cases
in
1960
and
there
are
over
300
now.
this
speaks
for
itself.
the
commissioner
has
only
one
excuse
for
this
extraordinary
course
of
conduct.
he
says
that
over
the
first
47
years
of
the
modern
income
tax,
he
didn't
really
focus
on
the
issue.
he
is
--
mr.
james
b.
lewis
he
did
not
focus
on
the
issue
for
the
first
47
years.
he
is
dissatisfied,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
the
quality
of
his
eyesight
for
47
years.
now
he
says
in
1960's,
“eyes
cleared”,
and
we
have
three
replies
to
that.
first,
you
cannot
read
the
authorities
we
have
cited
without
being
convinced
that
the
focus
was
there.
we
have
quoted
in
our
briefs
portions
of
most
penetrating
analysis
from
these
cases.
this
court's
1927
decision
in
ludey
contains
the
classic
statement
of
the
purpose
of
depreciation.
the
tax
courts
early
cases
are
equally
penetrating.
the
commissioner's
published
rulings
not
only
state
that
depreciation
is
allowable
in
the
year
of
sale,
they
tell
us
why.
secondly,
the
commissioner
cannot
excuse
47
years
of
administrative
practice,
published
rulings,
court
decisions,
congressional
re-enactment,
committee
reports,
regulations,
and
equity
essences
in
court
decisions
on
the
ground
that
his
eyesight
wasn't
good.
he
cannot
just
wave
the
magic
wand
of
shortsightedness
and
dismiss
what
otherwise
obviously
has
produced
a
rule
of
law
that
he
can
no
longer
change.
but
our
third
answer
is
the
most
important.
and
that
is
that
his
ability
to
focus
did
not
improve
in
1960,
unfortunately,
it
declined.
his
new
position
will
not
stand
up
on
their
analysis.
his
position
for
47
years
stands
up
handily.
what
he
is
now
attempting
to
do
is
to
scrap
the
basic
function
of
depreciation
which
is
the
allocation
of
the
original
cost
of
an
asset
in
a
reasonable
manner
over
the
elements
of
income
or
loss
that
it
will
produce.
you've
got
to
fragment
its
cost
just
as
though
you
were
buying
a
land
and
building,
affixed
non-depreciable
asset
and
the
depreciable
asset
or
as
though
you
were
buying
land
and
supporting
standing
timber
again
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
existing
at
the
time
of
purchase,
you've
got
to
determine
how
many
of
the
dollars
you
laid
out
must
be
considered
the
cost
of
the
land,
and
how
many
the
cost
of
the
timber.
similarly,
this
taxpayer
when
it
bought
the
ship
but
two
assets.
it
bought
an
old
liberty
ship
that
was
going
to
be
good
for
three
years
as
a
tramp
steamer
and
it
bought
the
right
to
receive
the
--
whatever
the
scrap
iron
would
bring
when
the
ship
was
scrapped
at
the
end
of
the
three
years.
and
just
as
you
have
to
divide
the
original
cost
on
some
reasonable
basis
between
the
building
and
the
land
or
the
timber
and
the
land,
so
it
had
to
be
divided
here
between
the
depreciable
asset,
the
use
of
the
ship
as
a
tramp
steamer
and
the
non-depreciable
asset,
the
use
of
the
ship
for
scrap.
this
is
the
ruling
there,
so
we
have
no
argument
here
about
the
correctness
of
the
original
determinations
of
salvage
value
and
the
balance
of
cost
that's
depreciable
over
the
useful
life
because
the
ruling
fixed
that
and
the
commissioner
does
not
repudiate
the
ruling.
we
do
not
have
the
problem
that
was
presented
in
massey,
the
massey
and
hertz
cases
here
in
which
the
taxpayers
have
taken
--
had
made
bad
estimates,
but
we
have
approved
estimates.
the
commissioner's
says
however
that
the
estimates
are
merely
provisional
that
the
minute
you
determine
what
the
actual
period
of
holding
is
and
what
the
actual
sales
price
is,
then
you
must
abandon
the
provisional
estimates.
you
must
abandon
the
temporary
estimates
because
now
you
have
the
truth.
now,
you
know
how
long
the
asset
was
used
and
what
it
was
sold
for,
and
these
automatically
supplant
the
determinations
made
at
the
time
of
purchase.
our
answer
to
this
is
that
the
ship
that
was
sold
in
december
of
1957
is
not
the
same
ship
that
was
bought
in
december
of
1955,
nor
indeed
was
the
same
ship
that
existed
on
january
1
of
1957.
in
1927,
justice
brandeis
said
in
the
ludey
case
when
the
plant
has
disposed
off
after
years
of
use,
the
thing
then
sold
is
not
the
whole
thing
originally
acquired.
therefore,
you
cannot
match
the
cost
of
what
was
acquired
a
greater
--
the
cost
of
a
greater
asset
against
the
sales
price
of
a
different
asset,
a
lesser
asset
that
it
is
sold
later.
the
commissioner
disregards
that.
he
wants
to
match
the
cost
of
the
greater
asset
that
existed
on
january
1,
1957
against
the
sale
price
received
for
the
lesser
asset
in
december
of
1957.
and
since
the
sale
price
received
for
the
lesser
asset,
absorbs
the
cost
of
the
greater
asset,
this
is
well
during
inflationary
periods,
he
says
the
asset
used
up
during
the
year
costs
nothing.
this
is
nonsense.
obviously,
the
taxpayer
did
not
get
that
the
1957
use
of
its
ship
for
nothing.
mr.
james
b.
lewis
the
clear
reputation
of
the
commissioners'
argument
is
his
unwillingness
to
extend
his
principles
to
sales
at
a
loss.
we
have
326,000
of
un-recovered
cost
on
january
1,
1957,
suppose
too
as
it
not
happen
and
that
the
ship
had
been
sold
for
$50,000.
he
would
be
unwilling
to
allow
increased
depreciation
for
the
year
of
sale.
he
takes
an
approach
of
‘heads,
i
win
-
tails,
you
lose'.
his
approach
however
cannot
be
sustained.
obviously,
if
the
original
determination
of
useful
life
and
salvage
value
are
purely
provisional
that
they
must
yield
to
the
facts
as
soon
as
the
facts
are
known.
this
is
just
as
true
for
a
sale
at
a
loss
as
it
is
for
a
sale
of
a
gain,
and
therefore,
he
cannot
hold
the
line
against
the
loss
situation.
now,
what
happened
is
this.
in
1962
and
1964,
congress
cured
his
problem
as
to
sales
that
he
gained
completely
as
to
personal
property,
and
in
very
substantial
part
as
to
real
property
by
providing
that
upon
the
sale,
the
depreciation
taken
not
only
in
the
year
of
sale,
but
all
during
the
life
of
the
property
must
first
be
applied
against
the
gain
and
recaptured
as
ordinary
income,
and
only
the
balance
of
profit,
if
any,
can
be
capital
gain.
as
i
say,
this
is
wholly
true
for
personalty
and
partly
true
for
realty.
the
loss
situation
however
remains
open
for
exploitation
and
that
there
is
no
answer
for
the
commissioner
to
say
that
sales
at
a
loss
are
ordinarily
ordinary
losses
because
very,
very
frequently
they
are
not.
often
they
are
capital
losses
from
one
of
two
reasons.
they
may
have
to
be
matched
against
gain
on
the
sale
of
other
types
of
assets,
for
example,
a
vacant
land
or
the
asset
being
sold
may
not
be
a
business
asset
but
an
asset
that
i
simply
hold
for
the
production
of
income,
although
i'm
a
lawyer,
i
may
have
a
house
that
i
am
renting.
and
there,
i
have
to
take
a
capital
loss,
just
as
the
commissioner
contended
recently
that
the
owner
of
a
resource
had
to
take
and
contended
successfully.
thirdly,
lots
of
losses
cannot
be
taken
at
all.
if
i
trade-in
my
old
business
car
on
a
new
business
car,
i
am
denied
any
loss
at
all,
it's
nonrecognized.
and
the
code
has
a
long
list,
15
or
20
nonrecognition
provisions
that
we
could
examine
in
this
connection
and
apply
to
what
we
have
here.
now,
if
the
commissioner
is
right,
why
has
congress
denied
recognition
of
losses
for
depreciable
property?
and
why
has
congress
provided
that
losses
on
sale
of
depreciable
property
under
various
circumstances
shall
be
capital
losses?
because
there
are
no
such
losses,
the
commissioner
now
contends.
if
the
original
estimates
must
yield
to
the
actual
sales
price,
losses
from
sales
of
depreciable
property
are
wiped
out,
this
great
complex
of
code
provisions
become
meaningless
and
congress
is
struggled
with
the
loss
problem
in
the
1938
act,
and
then
the
1942
act,
and
then
1962,
and
then
1964,
puts
legislation
in
a
vacuum,
legislation
on
a
non-existent
problem
if
we
believe
what
the
commissioner
now
says.
i
will
close
by
reading
two
sentences
from
the
commissioner's
brief
before
this
court
in
the
massey
case
in
1960.
if,
as
the
commissioner
contends,
the
depreciation
deduction
must
be
based
upon
a
rate
determined
by
the
period
during
which
the
asset
can
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
used
in
the
taxpayer's
business,
and
their
reasonable
estimate
of
salvage
value
at
the
end
of
that
period,
there
will
be
no
conversion
of
ordinary
income
into
a
capital
gain.
ordinary
and
predictable
salvage
value,
determined
as
of
the
time
that
sale
of
the
asset
is
contemplated
will
impose
a
realistic
ceiling
upon
depreciation
claims.
this
court
read
the
brief.
it
decided
its
massey
decision
on
the
basis
of
that
brief.
the
basis
of
that
decision
is
what
the
commissioner
now
asks
this
court
to
overthrow.
mr.
james
b.
lewis
may
it
please
the
court.
i
agree
that
we
have
the
other
question
of
what
is
a
reasonable
allowance
for
depreciation.
what
does
petitioner
had
on
january
1,
1957
was
two
assets.
he
had
the
use
of
the
ship
for
scrap,
a
potential
use
for
scrap
on
which
the
parties
agree
--
to
which
the
parties
agree
$54,000
of
the
costs
should
be
allocated.
he
had
the
predicted
two
remaining
years
of
use
as
a
cargo
carrier
based
on
a
determination
that
both
parties
also
agree
on.
and
the
balance
of
his
cost
$270,000
must
have
been
the
cost
of
what
he
was
going
to
use
after
that
two
years.
he
consumed
one
of
the
two
years
and
then
he
sold
to
a
competitor
the
right
to
use
the
vessel
for
the
second
of
the
two
years
plus
the
scrap
value.
the
petitioner
took
the
$270,000
of
remaining
cost
fairly
attributable
to
the
usefulness
of
the
vessel
as
a
cargo
carrier
and
applied
half
of
it
against
the
1957
year
he
used
up,
and
he
applied
half
against
the
1958,
year
of
you
see
it
sold.
the
commissioner
says,
“no,
zero
to
57th
year
of
use,
$270,000
to
the
58th
year
of
use.
that
cost
you
$270,000,
1957
cost
you
nothing.
now,
which
is
reasonable?
take
one
case
just
to
focus
on
the
issue.suppose
that
i
own
a
patent
that
i
had
purchased
and
it
has
two
years
to
run.
and
i
have
under
a
fair
allocation
of
cost
set
up
by
a
ruling,
$270,000
of
un-recovered
cost
and
i
have
two
years
to
go,
and
then
it's
worth
zero,
absolutely
worth
zero.
which
should
i
do
if
i
use
one
year,
if
i
consume
‘57
and
get
the
‘57
royalties,
make
money
for
‘57
and
then
sell
the
to
you
the
right
to
receive
the
‘58
royalties,
shall
i
apply
$135,000
to
‘57
and
$135,000
to
58?
is
that
reasonable?
or
is
this
reasonable?
zero,
$270,000.
now
the
commissioner
gets
there
by
inventing
an
argument
that's
utterly
circular,
utterly
unsupported,
he's
made
it
up
as
though
this
were
field
of
pure
reason,
no
history,
and
he
says,
“history
is
not
on
the
merits.”
and
then
having
ventured
into
this
field
of
pure
reason,
he
reasons
so
badly
that
you
get
this
preposterous
result
of
one
year
costing
nothing
and
the
second
here
costing
everything,
nothing
could
be
more
unreasonable
than
that.
