justice
potter
stewart
the
rule
for
which
he
contends
limited
to
the
--
that
year,
that
the
year
in
which
the
sale
was
made.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
the
useful
life
for
the
asset
though,
is
it?
that's
just
how
long
he
owned
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
of
anything,
the
useful
life
--
life
was
prolonged
by
the
artificial
market
created
by
this
suez
crisis.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
talking
about
--
more
about
concept
like
salvage
value
which
is
quite
different.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
your,
if
i
can
interrupt
and
i
apologize,
useful
life
--
can
we
both
agree,
it
doesn't
have
any
--
useful
life
of
an
asset
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
much
with
how
long
a
person
owns
that
asset.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
scrap,
as
salvage?
justice
potter
stewart
now
that,
as
i
understand
as
i
recollect
those
cases,
as
i
then
understood
them,
the
useful
life
to
that
particular
taxpayer's
business
was
short
because
his
business
required
that
the
cars
be
relevantly
late
model
cars.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it
true?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
assuming
in
what
--
is
that
a
ten-year
life?
