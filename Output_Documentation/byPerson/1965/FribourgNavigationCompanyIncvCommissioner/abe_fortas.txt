justice
abe
fortas
mr.
levin,
just
before
you
do
that,
as
i
understood
most
of
the
laws,
his
point
is
that
the
ship
brought
the
less
at
the
end
of
1957
than
it
would
have
brought
in
the
sale
at
the
beginning
of
1957,
which
to
a
layman
sounds
reasonably
sensible,
perhaps
it
isn't.
justice
abe
fortas
if
that
is
so,
if
that
is
so
and
you'll
tell
me
if
it
is
not;
if
that
is
so,
how
do
you
reconcile
--
how
do
you
explain
your
statement
that
the
use
of
the
(inaudible)
1957
cost
the
petitioner
nothing?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
not
this
case,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps,
i
know
--
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps,
i
know
--
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps,
i'm
mistaken
mr.
levin,
but
the
amount
that
this
taxpayer
were
to
depreciate,
it
was
the
amount
that
he
actually
paid
for
the
ship,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
should
have
said
based
on
the
amount
that
it
paid
for
originally.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me,
and
this
will
be
my
last
question
for
you.
justice
abe
fortas
but,
your
ship
--
what
do
mean
by,
during
when
i
--
what
seems
to
me
to
be
shifting
back
and
forth
between
two
price
figures
or
cost
figures
are
the
latest
cost
figures,
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i'm
following
you,
this
taxpayer
has
taken
its
original
cost
as
the
basis
for
depreciation.
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
that
right?
now,
that
cost
figure
did
not
change?
justice
abe
fortas
--
not
changed
the
market
so
that
the
taxpayer
at
the
--
sometime
in
1957
was
able
to
realize
the
problem.
now,
what
bothers
me
is
that
i
don't
see
the
relationship
between
that
figure
and
the
initial
figure
which
was
a
basis
for
the
depreciation,
if
as
i
gather
is
not
contested
here,
the
original
figure
was
a
bona
fide
figure
in
this.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
levin,
excuse
me.
i
read
this
letter
and
on
page
--
page
65
of
the
agreement.
i
must
have
misread
what
it
says
there,
because
as
i
read
the
paragraph
on
page
65
of
the
record,
it's
part
of
that
letter,
i
thought
that
the
phrase
“subject
to
such
change
and
subsequent
experience”
may
were
refer
to
the
termination
date
and
there
is
nothing
in
there
that
i
found
which
says
that
it's
not
a
binding
agreement
under
the
(inaudible).
however
that
maybe
--
however
that
may
be,
do
you
read
that
paragraph
as
relating
to
--
to
refer
to
as
costs
and
--
it's
maybe
cost
or
selling
price.
do
you
see
what
i'm
referring
to?
justice
abe
fortas
i
want
to
know,
i
want
to
know
what
you
said
about
that
paragraph.
justice
abe
fortas
on
page
65
of
the
record,
which
is
the
paragraph
that
i
assume
is
referred
then
in
your
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
does
the
--
has
anything
in
the
letter
that
goes
beyond
the
termination
date?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
in
your
brief
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
your
brief,
on
pages
2
and
3,
it
has
to
be
read
with
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
determined
as
of
the
time
of
the
acquisition
of
the
asset
at
the
beginning?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
you're
saying
is
that
this
ought
to
be
determined
when
as
--
and
if
there
is
a
sale
of
the
asset
at
a
higher
price,
and
then
now
that
the
change
in
the
salvage
value
ought
to
be
taken
into
account
by
disallowing
the
depreciation
the
last
year
which
i
have
a
little
difficulty
in
seeing
--
you
mentioned
between
that
and
the
change
in
the
salvage
value
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
you
don't
re-compute
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
depreciation
of
this?
justice
abe
fortas
you
make
some
kind
of
an
assumption,
don't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
and
there
is
an
equation
between
the
two?
