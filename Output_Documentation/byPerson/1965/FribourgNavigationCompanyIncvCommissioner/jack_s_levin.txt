mr.
jack
s.
levin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
well,
i
would
like
very
much
to
spend
the
majority
of
my
argument,
as
mr.
lewis
has
not,
on
the
merits
of
this
case.
i
recognized
that
although
i
have
in
my
brief
dealt
at
length
with
his
re-enactment
argument,
i
should
also
discuss
it
here.
let
me
first
state,
as
i
see
it,
the
issue
on
the
merits.
and
then,
deal
specifically
with
his
re-enactment
argument
which
does
not
go
to
the
merits
of
the
commissioner's
position,
but
whether
congress
has
precluded
the
commissioner
from
taking
his
position.
in
1955,
the
petitioner
purchased
a
ship
for
$470,000.
in
december
1957,
it
sold
that
ship
for
approximately
$700,000.
that
is
for
$230,000
more
than
it
originally
paid
for
the
ship.
now
the
question
on
the
merits
for
this
court
is
whether
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
take
$135,000
deduction
for
depreciation
in
1957.
that
is
the
year
in
which
it
had
already
sold
the
ship
for
more
than
it
originally
he
paid
for
it.
the
government's
position
in
short
is
that
since
at
the
end
of
1957,
petitioner
knew
that
the
ship,
that
the
use
of
the
ship,
had
not
cost
at
anything.
it
was
not
entitled
to
take
a
depreciation
deduction
for
that
year.
we
believe
that
petitioner
should
not
be
able
to
intentionally
distort
its
income
by
deducting
a
$135,000
cost
which
it
knows
it
will
never
incur.
i
think
that
the
difference
between
the
petitioner's
view
and
ours
goes
to
the
essence
of
the
depreciation
deduction.
we
believe
that
the
depreciation
deduction
is
there
like
all
the
other
deductions
in
the
code
in
order
to
permit
the
taxpayer
to
deduct
against
his
income,
the
costs
of
earning
the
income.
and
that
is
it
not
entitled,
the
petitioner
like
any
other
taxpayer,
is
not
entitled
to
deduct
the
cost
which
it
will
not
incur.
of
course,
the
depreciation
deduction
computed
as
it
frequently
is
before
the
events
must
take
into
account
estimates
as
to
future
events.
however,
once
those
future
events
have
occurred
and
the
actual
facts
are
known,
we
contend
that
thereafter,
and
only
thereafter,
the
petitioner
is
required
to
take
cognizance
of
reality
and
not
to
ignore
it.
the
regulations,
which
we
believe
are
clearly
authorized
by
the
code
provision
being
interpreted
and
which
the
petitioner
has
not
challenge,
state
specifically
that
the
reasonableness
of
each
year's
allowance
for
depreciation
shall
be
judged
in
terms
of
the
conditions
known
to
exist
at
the
end
of
that
year.
in
other
words,
when
you
seek
to
compute
your
depreciation
deduction
in
december
of
a
given
year,
the
last
day
of
the
year,
you
will
judge
the
reasonableness
of
that
deduction
in
light
of
the
facts
that
are
known.
now,
i
will
diverge
for
a
moment
from
the
argument
on
the
merits
in
order
to
answer
the
re-enactment
argument.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i
will
not
take
issue
with
the
fact.
i
will
concede
the
fact
that
your
honor
states,
mr.
justice
fortas,
what
i
do
say
is
that
the
code
does
not
give
a
person
a
deduction
for
physical
wear
and
tear
but
only
for
money
expended.
in
other
words,
if
petitioner
had
purchased
a
machine
worth
$10,000
at
the
time
when
the
market
for
such
machinery
was
very
depressed,
so
that
the
true
value
of
the
machine
was
much
more.
petitioner
expected
to
use
that
machine
for
let's
say
two
years.
and
then
petitioner
reasonably
expected
to
be
able
to
sell
that
machine
for
$10,000,
just
exactly
what
it
did
pay
for.
now
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
let
me
take
that
case
first.
it
is
conceded,
i
believe
by
petitioner
and
by
all
concerned,
that
that
man
would
not
be
able
to
take
any
deduction
on
the
machine.
even
if,
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
year
of
use,
he
could
have
sold
the
machine
for
$20,000,
but
that
because
he
held
it
until
the
end
of
the
year,
he
was
able
to
sell
it
for
only
$10,000.
in
other
words,
if
an
item
doesn't
costs
a
taxpayer
anything
an
out
of
pocket
money,
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
deduction.
i
think
perhaps
the
clearest
example
is
the
taxpayer
who
operates
his
own
business.
and
he
works
hard
from
morning
until
night
six
days
a
week
and
he
realizes
that
if
had
to
hire
somebody
to
come
in
there
and
operate
that
business,
it
would
cost
him
$10,000
a
year
to
pay
the
man.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
if
he
doesn't
hire
anyone
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
--
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
deduction.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the
--
in
deduction
for
depreciation
was
intended
to
permit
a
man
to
deduct
the
entire
amount
he
originally
pays
for
an
asset,
but
only
his
net
cost.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes,
of
course
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
--
it
was
based
on
original
cost
mr.
jack
s.
levin
however,
at
the
time
the
taxpayer
petitioner
here
sought
to
take
that
deduction,
it
knew
that
it
was
not
going
to
incur
that
cost.
now,
the
setup
of
the
regulations
which
i
believed
interpret
the
code
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i'm
happy
to
have
your
questions,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes,
your
honor,
it
was
bona
fide.
and
in
fact,
that
i
might
mention
that,
as
mr.
lewis
pointed
out,
there
was
a
letter
ruling
at
the
beginning.
in
other
words,
the
taxpayer
came
in
and
he
said
to
the
internal
revenue
service.
“i
bought
a
ship
and
i
paid
$470,000.
i
think
it's
going
to
--
i
think
i'm
going
to
use
the
ship
for
three
years.
and
at
the
end
of
that
period,
i
believe
i
will
be
able
to
sell
it
for
scrap
steel
for
$50,000.
i
think,
it's
going
to
cost
me
$420,000
for
the
ship.
and
i
would
like
to
write
that
off
over
the
straight-line
method
over
three
years.”
and
the
internal
revenue
service
said,
and
on
a
letter
to
the
taxpayer,
we
referred
to
as
a
letter
ruling,
it
said,
“on
the
face
of
it,
these
things
look
alright
to
us
now.”
however,
the
internal
revenue
service
specifically
said
as
we
quote
on
page
2
of
our
brief,
that
this
letter
does
not
constitute
a
binding
agreement
under
code
section
167
(d)
which
sets
up
a
system
under
which
binding
agreements
maybe
made.
but
i
might
note
parenthetically
that
even
under
section
167
(d),
if
the
facts
change,
the
ruling
is
no
longer
valid.
and
the
internal
revenue
service
went
on
to
state
that
the
ruling
was
subject
to
such
change
in
the
event
of
subsequent
experience
should
be
different
than
expected.
so
i
think
that
disposes
of
the
ruling
as
being
binding.
in
other
words,
basis
of
the
facts
as
they
existed
in
1955
when
this
ship
was
acquired,
that
the
internal
revenue
service
agrees
with
the
petitioner
that
at
that
time,
it's
seemed
reasonable
that
the
ship
would
cost
the
taxpayer
$420,000
to
use
it
for
three
years.
now
mr.
justice
fortas,
an
answer
to
your
question,
that
taxpayers
started
out,
and
in
the
first
year,
it
took
a
depreciation
deduction
based
on
those
assumptions.
but
by
the
end
of
1957,
he
knew
that
the
ship
was
not
going
to
cost
him
$420,000.
he
knew
in
fact
that
the
ship
had
not
cost
him
anything
to
use
it.
now,
he'd
already
had
depreciation
deductions
for
1955
for
a
month
or
so,
and
for
the
entire
year
1956.
the
commissioner
does
not
seek
to
go
back
and
reopen
those
deductions.
in
fact,
the
precedents
would
preclude
the
commissioner,
i
think
wisely
so
from
doing
that,
because
if
the
depreciation
deduction
was
reasonable
in
light
of
the
facts
existing
at
the
end
of
1955
and
the
end
of
1966,
in
light
of
the
facts
than
existing,
the
commissioner
under
the
annual
accounting
system
would
not
seek
to
reopen
those
facts
as
this
court
said
in
(inaudible)
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
as
i
read
both
the
code
and
the
regulation
mr.
jack
s.
levin
which
paragraph,
your
honor?
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes.
that
paragraph
says
that
the
termination
date
of
october
10,
1964
that
refers
to
the
three-year
useful
life
is
subject
to
such
changes,
subsequent
experience
may
warrant.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no.
it
doesn't
specifically
say
that
salvage
value
or
resale
price
is
subject
to
such
change
and
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
--
subsequent
experience
may
warrant.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no.
the
brief
specifically
says
that,
your
honor.
i'll
quote
from
my
brief
on
page
2
and
3,
it
says
that
the
letter
stated
that
the
useful
life
was
subject
to
such
changes
experience
may
warrant.
i
specifically
say
that.
now,
i
think
its
quite
clear
and
i
--
with
section
167
(d)
of
code,
it
sets
out
a
procedure
whereby
a
taxpayer
can
ask
for
a
binding
ruling.
and
if
he
gets
such
a
binding
ruling
and
he
only
gets
such
if
it
specifically
says
that
it's
pursuant
to
section
167
(d);
here
the
taxpayer
may
change
the
method
of
computing
depreciation,
that
is
either
the
useful
life
or
the
salvage
value,
unless
the
other
gives
notice
--
states
that
the
facts
have
changed.
there
has
been
a
subsequent
change
in
the
facts.
it
makes
it
quite
clear
that
even
if
this
had
been
a
167
(d),
which
it
which
was
not,
because
it
didn't
specifically
mention
this
section,
that
even
in
such
an
event,
the
commissioner
could
have
changed
the
salvage
value,
could
have
changed
the
useful
life
if
the
facts
change.
here
the
facts
did
change.
i
don't
think
there's
any
contention
that
this
ruling
is
more
than
advisory
to
the
taxpayer,
that
it
doesn't
bind
the
internal
revenue
service
and
prevent
it
from
ever
revoking
it.
and
in
fact,
this
court
has
approved
retroactive
revocations
of
rulings.
this
was
not
a
retroactive
revocation.
no
attempt
was
made
to
disallow
depreciation
in
previous
years.
even
the
regulations
themselves
which
certainly
are
governing
here,
and
the
taxpayers
hasn't
challenged
their
validity,
the
regulations
themselves
provide
for
changes
in
useful
life
and
salvage
value
at
mid-stream
and
depreciation
where
the
facts
changed.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
the
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
regulations
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
regulations
specifically
say
that
if
at
anytime
during
the
life
of
an
asset,
there
is
a
substantial
change
in
the
estimated
period
that
the
taxpayer
will
use
it.
that
is
in
the
estimated
useful
life
of
the
asset.
then,
at
the
end
of
the
year
in
which
these
facts
arise,
that
the
depreciation
deduction
for
that
year
and
for
subsequent
years
shall
be
recomputed.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no.
i'll
get
to
that
right
now.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
regulations
say
that
if
the
useful
life
changes
substantially,
the
depreciation
formula
shall
be
recomputed.
the
new
useful
life
shall
be
used
and
at
that
time,
a
new
salvage
value
or
estimated
resale
price.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
the
new
estimated
useful
life
and
resale
price
shall
be
used.
the
regulations
do
not
specifically
advert
to
the
occasion,
to
the
events
now
before
this
court.
that
is
what
happens
if
there
is
no
change
in
useful
life,
but
merely
a
change
in
resale
price.
now,
i
have
two
answers
to
that
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
there
was
a
significant
change
in
useful
life
in
this
case.
taxpayer
originally
estimated
he
would
use
the
asset
three
years.
he
ended
up
using
it
exactly
two
years
and
thereto
off
either
way.
that's
a
33
and
a
third
percent
or
50%
depending
on
how
you
compute
it,
reduction
in
useful
life.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
it
again
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well
again,
it
depends
on
how
you
view
the
concept
of
depreciation.
we
believed
that
depreciation
is
realistic
in
common
sense
attempt.
to
allow
a
taxpayer
to
deduct
over
the
period
he
actually
uses
an
asset
an
amount
of
money
equal
to
his
actual
cost,
net
cost
if
you
will,
of
using
that
evidence.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no,
your
honor.
i
would
have
to
disagree
with
that.
in
1960,
this
court
decided
the
hertz
and
massey
cases.
and
now
this
case,
as
they
said,
useful
life
does
not
depend
on
the
physical
life
of
an
asset.
salvage
value
does
not
depend
on
the
scrap
value
of
an
asset.
rather
that
useful
life
depends
on
a
period
that
the
taxpayer
expects
to
use
the
asset,
and
salvage
value
refers
to
the
resale
price
he
reasonably
expects
obtain
for
the
asset
at
the
end
of
his
expected
period
of
use.
now,
when
this
taxpayer
acquired
the
asset,
he
reasonably
expected
to
use
it
three
years.
he
reasonably
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
--
expected
to
get
$50,000
as
scrap
for
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
correct.
now,
the
reason
at
this
court
said
in
hertz
and
massey,
that
useful
life
and
salvage
value
were
to
be
interpreted
in
this
realistic
and
common
sense
way.
that
is
that
it
referred
to
the
period
that
this
taxpayer
expected
to
use
the
asset.
and
referred
to
the
price
he
expected
to
receive
on
resale.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
right.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
right.
but,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
here
is
the
reason
that
this
court
selected,
not
just
in
that
one
case
but
overall,
selected
the
meaning
for
useful
life
and
resale
value
realistically
in
terms
of
what
this
taxpayer
expected
to
get
for
at
the
end
rather
than
some
scrap
value
that
was
artificial
as
this
court
phrased
it.
and
that
this
--
this
taxpayer
didn't
expect
to
sell
the
asset
was
because,
i
contend,
that
this
court
recognized
that
depreciation
was
an
inherently
realistic
attempt
to
allow
the
taxpayer
to
write
off
over
his
actual
period
of
use,
his
actual
cost
for
the
asset.
and
this
court
said
that
at
the
beginning
when
you
first
acquire
it,
you
must
take
realistic
estimates.
how
long
do
you
really
expect
to
use
it
and
what
you
really
expect
to
receive
for
it
at
the
end,
write
off
that
realistically
estimated
net
cost
over
your
realistic
period.
now,
here
we
are
--
we
are
taking
that,
that
very
concept,
that
very
thought
one-step
further.
we
are
saying
in
the
year
when
the
taxpayer
finds
out
that
the
facts
are
different
than
he
estimated
at
the
beginning,
if
he
has
found
out
that
he
has
written
off
the
entire
cost
of
his
asset,
he
may
not
then
take
an
additional
cost,
an
unrealistic
cost.
in
the
massey
case
and
in
the
hertz
case
dealing
with
these
depreciation
questions
--
well,
i
don't
contend
at
all
that
those
cases
governed
this
case.
i
contend
that
the
principles
that
this
court
discussed
and
used
there
are
very
persuasive
here.
that
court
said
that
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
that's
right.
the
regulation
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
i
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
--
depreciation
for
previous
years?
mr.
jack
s.
levin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
well,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i'd
like
to
try
to
answer
that
in
two
steps
if
i
can
and
i'll
try
to
direct
myself
to
your
question.
in
the
first
place,
if
a
taxpayer
buys
an
asset
for
a
$100,000
and
he
figures
he's
going
to
use
it
for
five
years
and
he
writes
it
off
that
he
won't
receive
anything
for
it
when
it's
all
done.
he
writes
it
off,
$20,000
a
year
for
five
years.
near
the
end
of
the
fifth
year,
a
war
breaks
out,
an
international
crisis
or
some
kind,
and
this
machine
we're
talking
about
here,
cannot
be
replaced.
he
ends
up
using
it,
let's
assume,
another
five
years,
it's
quite
clear
that
he
doesn't
get
any
additional
depreciation
for
the
remaining
five
years
he
used
it.
and
the
reason
is
because,
he's
written
off
his
entire
cost.
now,
we
contend
that
the
purpose
of
depreciation
is
the
eminently
realistic
one
of
allowing
a
taxpayer
to
write
off,
not
his
entire
cost
of
the
asset.
this
courts
decisions
in
massey
and
hertz
make
come
quite
clear,
that
it's
not
intended
to
let
you
write
off
your
entire
cost
of
an
asset,
but
just
the
cost
you
will
actually
incur.
that
is
your
original
cost
less
your
salvage
value
or
resale
price.
now,
once
this
taxpayer
knew,
which
he
did
at
the
end
of
1957,
that
this
asset
hadn't
cost
him
a
penny,
i
believe
he
was
in
exactly
the
same
position
if
the
taxpayer
would
have
written
off
his
entire
cost.
he
knew
he'd
written
off
more
than
the
asset
cost
because
he
got
a
$142,000
worth
of
depreciation
in
the
previous
two
years
and
the
asset
hadn't
cost
him
anything.
we
think
that
to
allow
him
to
intentionally
take
depreciation
that
he
knows
he
will
never
incur,
it
would
distort
his
income.
we
don't
believe
that
depreciation
was
ever
intended
to
serve
his
function.
when
congress
enacted
the
allowance
for
depreciation,
it
said
that
a
taxpayer
should
be
allowed
a
reasonable
allowance
for
depreciation.
vague
words,
admittedly.
it
then
went
on
to
say
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
or
his
delegate
would
have
authority
to
issue
regulations
and
it
--
depreciation
would
be
computed
in
accordance
with
those
regulations,
that's
section
167
(b)
of
the
code
cited
in
our
appendix.
now
we
contend
two
things
--
first,
that
the
regulation
specifically
covered
this
case,
not
in
so
many
words
but
the
concepts
in
the
regulations.
and
second,
that
to
the
extent
the
regulations
covered
this
case,
they
make
sense,
they
are
reasonable
and
they
are
in
accord
with
the
statutory
purpose,
as
it's
evident
on
the
face
the
depreciation
statute,
and
as
it's
evident
from
this
courts
decision
in
massey
and
hertz.
the
regulations
--
and
i'll
state
a
couple
of
points
and
regulations
very
briefly,
say
first
of
all
that
the
reasonableness
of
each
year's
depreciation
deduction
shall
be
judged
on
the
basis
of
the
conditions
known
to
exist
at
the
end
of
that
year.
now,
what
sense
would
there
be
in
judging
the
reasonableness
of
the
year's
depreciation
deduction,
say
five
years
after
the
asset
was
purchased,
if
not
to
see
whether
they
were
reasonable
in
light
of
writing
off
what
this
taxpayer
knew
or
reasonably
expected
to
be
his
cost.
second,
the
regulations
specifically
state
that
no
asset
shall
be
depreciated
below
a
reasonable
salvage
or
resale
value.
now,
we
think
that
regulation
itself
is
sufficient.
and
third,
the
regulations
give
examples,
instances
we
believe
as
i
answered
mr.
justice
white's
question,
where
depreciation
deductions
--
depreciation
formula
will
be
recomputed
and
the
salvage
value
or
resale
price
will
be
recomputed.
they
don't
say
that
it
will
be
in
this
case
where
you
actually
sell
the
asset,
but
we
believe
that
the
--
that
it's
a
clear
inference
that
whenever
it's
necessary
in
order
to
accurately
take
a
reasonable
allowance
for
depreciation,
you
must
make
that
effort.
now,
i
would
like
at
this
time
to
answer
specifically
mr.
lewis'
argument
regarding
the
loss
case.
he
says,
“this
is
a
gain
case,
what
about
the
loss
case?
the
same
thing
applies
and
it
doesn't
make
sense.”
now,
we
didn't
answer
that
in
our
brief
and
so
i'd
like
to
answer
it
now.
he
makes
at
point
one
of
his
reply
brief,
mr.
lewis
argues
that
by
parity
of
reasoning
and
if
this
court
holds
that
once
a
taxpayer
--
once
a
taxpayer
has
taken
all
the
depreciation
he's
entitled
to,
which
is
what
we're
arguing
here,
then
he's
not
entitled
to
anymore.
and
if
this
court
holds
that,
then
therefore
this
court
must
also
be
saying
that
if
the
taxpayer
sold
an
asset
at
a
tremendous
loss,
then
he
must
be
entitled
to
take
that
entire
loss
as
additional
depreciation
in
the
year
of
sale.
we
don't
believe
that
this
necessarily
follows.
in
the
first
--
in
the
first
place
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
we
do
not
believe
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i'm
going
to
explain
why.
i
think
they
may
be
treated
differently.
we
don't
believe
it
necessarily
follows
that
if
the
government
wins
this
case,
the
taxpayer
wins
the
loss
case.
we
don't
think
that
follows.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commissioner
has
taken
the
position
in
a
very
few
cases
that
have
arisen,
and
there's
only
been
a
couple
that
the
loss
is
not
additional
depreciation.
certainly,
after
this
court
makes
its
decision,
the
commissioner
may
well
have
an
opportunity
to
reexamine
his
position.
i
don't
suggest
he's
going
to
change
his
mind
on
it,
but
he'll
have
a
chance
to
reexamine
it,
he'll
have
an
opportunity
to
issue
rulings
or
regulations.
as
this
court
said
in
the
lake
case,
p.
g.
lake
case,
they
said
the
commissioner
can
exercise
his
continuing
rulemaking
power.
now
once
this
--
that
case
has
been
decided,
once
the
gain
case
has
been
decided,
if
the
commissioner
then
decides
that
the
loss
case
should
go
the
other
way,
i
think
there
may
well
be
reason
for
it
to
go
the
other
way,
as
i'll
state
in
just
a
moment.
the
statutory
test
of
course
is
a
reasonable
allowance
for
depreciation.
if
a
taxpayer
buys
an
asset
for
a
$100,000
and
it
depreciates
at
the
rate
of
$10,000
a
year
for
two
years,
so
he's
got
an
$80,000
un-depreciated
basis
in
that
asset,
and
then
he
sells
that
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
yes,
a
ten-year
life
and
no
salvage
value,
let's
say.
so
he
starts
out
with
asset
that
he
pays
a
$100,000
and
he
takes
$10,000
depreciation
at
the
first
year,
and
the
second
year,
he's
got
$80,000.00
un-depreciated
cost.
then
all
of
a
sudden,
by
the
end
of
the
third
year,
he
sells
that
asset
for
$10,000
--
it
may
well
be
that
$70,000
is
not
in
the
statutory
words,
are
reasonable
allowance
for
depreciation
for
that
third
year.
on
the
other
hand,
we
contend
that
if
the
taxpayer
at
the
end
of
that
third
year
sold
the
asset
for
$120,000,
it's
very
clear
that's
this
case.
it's
very
clear
that
no
deduction
for
depreciation
would
be
reasonable
and
that
any
deduction
for
depreciation
would
be
unreasonable.
but,
the
statutory
test
on
reasonable
allowance
for
depreciation
doesn't
necessarily
apply
to
the
gain
case
and
exactly
the
same
way
that
it
applies
to
the
loss
case.
as
mr.
lewis
phrase
it,
he
said,
“heads,
we
win.
tails,
you
lose,”
i
don't
think
this
is
as
easy
as
flipping
a
coin.
i
think
that
this
is
case
that
--
the
loss
case,
is
not
determinant
of
the
gain
case,
i
don't
think
the
government
has
to
explain
how
it's
going
to
treat
the
loss
case
or
decide
that
now.
mr.
jack
s.
levin
i'll
take
the
issue
with
this
interpretation,
your
honor,
i'll
state
it
very
briefly
here
but
it's
contained
a
great
length
in
the
brief.
first
of
all,
it's
quite
clear
that
during
a
large
percentage
of
the
eras
from
1939,
it
made
no
tax
difference
in
the
world
whether
depreciation
was
allowed
in
the
year
of
sale
or
not
because
the
vast
majority
of
the
case
as
cited
by
mr.
lewis
are
cases
where
the
taxpayer
received
ordinary
income
on
his
sale
of
the
asset.
that
meant
that
if
he
took
a
depreciation,
let's
say
of
$135,000
in
the
year
he
sold
the
asset,
that
reduced
his
operating
income
by
$135,000.
since
that
reduced
the
basis
of
his
asset
by
$135,000,
it
increased
his
gain
on
the
asset
by
a
$135,000.
if
that
gain
was
taxed
to
his
ordinary
income,
then
all
he
did
is
take
a
$135,000
of
operating
income
and
put
it
into
gain
on
the
asset.
and
both
were
taxed
exactly
the
same
way,
his
ordinary
income.
thus,
the
commissioner
would
have
been
laughed
out
at
the
court
if
he'd
brought
a
case
and
said,
“well,
this
taxpayer
put
the
$135,000
worth
of
income
in
the
wrong
place
on
his
return.
but
the
tax
result
is
just
the
same.”
mr.
lewis
cited
the
ludey
case,
decided
by
this
court
in
1927,
the
crane
case
decided
in
1947,
and
he
mentioned
another
case
in
1921,
all
three
of
those
cases
related
to
years
in
which
it
made
no
difference
whatsoever
how
you
computed
the
allowance
for
depreciation,
and
that's
why
the
commissioner
didn't
focus
on
the
issue.
i
admit
that
there
were
approximately,
i
believe,
eight
cases
according
to
mr.
lewis'
own
brief,
his
reply
brief,
approximately
eight
cases
during
the
entire
history
of
the
internal
revenue
code
in
which
it
would've
made
a
difference
and
in
which
the
commissioner
didn't
seek
to
disallow
the
depreciation.
but
there
was
no
focus
whatsoever
on
the
issue.
these
cases
came
shortly
after
the
change
in
the
code
had
made
the
--
had
made
the
gain
on
an
asset,
capital
gain.
they
came
at
a
time
when
the
commissioner
was
seeking
to
lay
down
the
basic
ground
rules
of
the
code.
they
all
involve
cases
such
as
whether
depreciation
was
allowable
at
all
on
a
given
type
of
asset
rather
than
how
you
--
exactly,
how
under
my
new
way
you
compute
depreciation
from
what
date
to
what
date.
they
involved
broad-sweeping
questions
and
sometimes
on
constitutional
issues
such
as
whether
in
the
given
case,
depreciation
should
be
computed
on
the
basis
of
the
cost
of
the
asset
or
its
value
on
march
1,
1913
when
the
code
was
enacted.
all
of
those
cases
involved
other
issues,
complex
issues
and
neither
the
courts
nor
the
commissioner
focused
on
it
and
it's
the
--
mr.
jack
s.
levin
there
was
some
capital
gain
on
assets
beginning
in
the
year
1921.
however
many
of
the
cases
decided
after
that
here
concerned
previous
years
for
another
eight
or
nine
years
at
least
that
litigation
concerned
pre-1921
years,
in
which
no
one
had
ever
heard
of
capital
gain.
moreover,
even
after
1921,
there
was
a
capital
gain
in
only
some
assets
and
the
vast
majority
of
the
cases
cited
by
mr.
lewis
dealing
with
those
later
years
also
concern
cases
in
which
the
particular
asset
involved
produced
ordinary
income.
now
in
1938,
congress
repealed
capital
gain
for
depreciable
assets
altogether.
and
from
1938
to
1942,
there
was
no
capital
gain
on
the
depreciable
asset.
thus,
every
case
involving
depreciable
assets
--
this
issue
was
mooted.
that's
the
era
out
which
the
crane
case
grew.
now
immediately
after
or
shortly
after
1942,
when
this
issue
again
became
revitalized
by
virtue
of
the
change
in
the
statute
in
1942
giving
capital
gain
on
the
sale
with
depreciable
assets,
the
commissioner
began
to
focus
on
it.
the
commissioner
disallowed
year
of
sale
depreciation
in
two
cases
that
we
discussed
at
length
in
our
brief,
one
involving
1942
depreciation
itself,
the
first
year
after
the
change
in
law,
another
involving
1944
depreciation.
now,
i'm
frank
to
admit
that
the
commissioner
probably
did
not
instruct
his
thousand
of
agents
to
go
out
and
seek
out
cases,
somehow,
these
two
arouse,
and
the
commissioner
disallowed
the
depreciation
--
1942
and
1944.
those
cases
were
hardly
litigated.
the
1942
case,
the
weir
long
leaf
case
resulted
in
a
confusing
decision
of
the
court,
somehow
upholding
the
commissioner
on
part
of
the
assets
and
not
upholding
him
on
the
other.
we
can
argue
over
whether
those
issues
are
reconcilable.
i
don't
think
they
are.
but
one
thing
is
clear.
the
commissioner
had
taken
the
position
that
the
depreciation
should
be
disallowed.
the
other
case
finally
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
that's
the
case
involving
1944
depreciation
and
the
commissioner
won
the
case,
that's
the
cohn
case.
now,
after
winning
the
cohn
case,
the
commissioner
then
issued
a
revenue
ruling
which
specifically
stated
the
principles
that
we
are
here
relying
upon
for
broad
application.
and
then
i'm
sure
revenue
agents
all
over
the
country
somehow
got
wind
that
this
was
an
important
issue,
and
now
there
are
approximately
300
or
400
cases
pending.
we
did
not
believe
that
the
commissioner's
failure
to
focus
upon
or
consider
the
issue
precludes
him
from
first
raising
it
in
1942.
in
fact
in
a
1927
case,
which
i
mentioned
only
because
--
not
because
the
issue
was
really
genuinely
focused
--
in
a
1927
case
mentioned
by
mr.
lewis
in
his
oral
argument,
the
commissioner
disallowed
depreciation
in
the
year
of
sale.
the
court
held
against
him,
but
he
had
disallowed
the
depreciation.
and
again,
it
was
not
raised
again
by
the
commissioner
until
1942
depreciation
came
into
existence.
but
in
essence,
before
i
sit
down,
let
me
just
say
that
we
contend
first,
that
the
commissioner
is
not
precluded
by
the
re-enactment
doctrine,
we
don't
think
the
commissioners
failure
to
raise
the
issue
for
a
few
years
really
came
to
the
attention
of
the
congress
or
can
be
deemed
by
this
court
in
light
of
the
precedents
cited
and
quoted
in
our
brief
to
have
caused
the
congress
to
make
a
considered
determination
that
a
reasonable
allowance
for
depreciation
should
not
be
interpreted
as
the
commissioner
now
interprets
it.
certainly,
the
congress
didn't
consider
this.
in
fact,
the
only
congressional
reference
to
it
was
in
1964
committee
reports
where
the
congress
specifically
said
that
it
did
not
intend
to
overturn
the
holding
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
other
cases,
which
went
in
the
favor
of
the
commissioner.
the
congress
said
that
in
the
1964
committee
report
and
that's
quoted
in
our
brief
as
well.second,
we
contend
that
once
this
court
reaches
the
issue
on
the
merits,
that
the
result
should
be
in
favor
of
the
commissioner
because
the
whole
history
and
purpose
of
depreciation
as
well
as
the
regulations
make
it
quite
clear
that
a
taxpayer
should
not
knowingly
be
allowed
to
deduct
a
cost
he
knows
he
will
never
incur.
we
think
it
would
intentionally
distort
his
income
and
we
contend
that
it
would
not
be
reasonable
allowance
for
depreciation.
