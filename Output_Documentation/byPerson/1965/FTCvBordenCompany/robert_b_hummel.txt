mr.
robert
b.
hummel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
an
order
of
the
federal
trade
commission
which
had
directed
the
borden
company
to
cease
discriminating
in
price
between
competing
purchasers
in
a
case
which
arose
out
of
the
sales
of
evaporated
milk,
allegedly
in
violation
of
section
2
(a)
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended
by
the
robinson-patman
act.
it's
pertinent
here
that
section
2
(a)
makes
it
unlawful
to
discriminate
in
price
between
purchasers
of
commodities
“of
like
grade
and
quality”
where
the
effect
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
the
borden
company
sells
milk,
evaporated
milk
under
the
well
known
borden
brands
all
over
the
united
states.
it
also
sells
evaporated
milk
to
certain
customers
under
the
brands
of
the
labels
of
those
customers
referred
to
in
this
record
as
private
label
milk.
physically,
the
milk
in
each
instance
was
identical
both
the
milk
itself
and
the
containers
and
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
borden
label
milk
and
the
private
label
milk
are
to
be
considered
commodities
of
like
grade
and
quality
within
the
meaning
of
section
2
(a).
the
question
arose
very
briefly
in
these
circumstances.
the
commission
held
that
because
the
goods
were
physically
identical,
they
were
like
grade
and
quality.
it
went
on
to
find
discrimination
and
injury
and
price
between
the
customers
for
borden
and
the
customers
for
the
private
label
milk.
it
concluded
that
the
two-price
system
may
have
the
effect
substantially
less
than
competition
both
at
the
primary
line
that
is
vis
à
vis
the
competitors
of
borden,
packers
of
milk
and
at
the
secondary
line
that
is
wholesale
and
retail
customers
for
the
borden
milk.
now,
those
findings
are
not
an
issue
here
because
the
court
below
did
not
reach
them.
we're
not
asking
for
review.
i
think
whatever
it
is
useful
to
put
the
legal
issue
in
context
to
review
just
generally
the
basis
for
those
conclusions.
the
commission
noted
at
the
primary
line
level
that
there
had
been
a
decline
generally
in
the
evaporated
milk
sales
throughout
the
industry,
that
10
producers
largely
in
the
midwest
area
had
dropped
out
of
this
business
since
1950
that
there
had
been
no
new
entrants
and
that
in
the
circumstances,
there
was
a
little
need
to
ship
the
competitive
balance
between
competitors.
it
said
that
borden
was
a
large
and
powerful
concern
compared
to
its
competitors
and
if
the
price
structure
which
it
was
utilizing
had
placed
a
severe
strain
on
small
competitors,
one
it
going
out
of
business
and
all
the
others
lost
large
and
important
accounts
on
a
permanent
basis.
they
found
finally
in
this
market
setting
that
there
was
a
clear
threat
to
the
entire
midwest
competition
if
the
discrimination
were
to
be
continued,
and
that
the
elimination
or
serious
impairment
of
competition
was
likely.
at
the
secondary
line,
the
commission
found
that
there
was
large
price
differences
between
the
competing
customers,
one
in
particularly
to
the
columbia,
south
carolina
area
which
is
an
area
close
to
one
of
the
borden
plants
since
borden
sold
the
private
label
milk
at
an
fob
plant
price
whereas
it
sold
the
borden
brand
milk
at
a
delivered
price,
uniform
throughout
the
united
states.
now
this
in
compared
prices
around
the
borden
plant,
the
court
--
the
commission
found
that
there
was
a
large
discrepancy
among
customers.
they
found
that
there
was
a
low
or
nonexistent
profit
margin
in
the
sale
of
evaporated
milk.
it
was
largely
handled
by
distributors
as
an
accommodation
and
often
used
as
a
loss
leader.
it
found
that
the
effect
of
the
--
of
the
discrimination
was
therefore
to
draw
customers
away
not
only
with
respect
to
evaporated
milk
but
also
with
respect
to
other
items
handled
by
the
wholesalers
and
retailers.
it
pointed
a
testimony
that
a
price
such
as
that
which
borden
offered
with
the
private
label
milk
would
have
been
a
great
aid
to
the
wholesalers
and
retailers
in
meeting
their
competition.
it
should
have
on
these
points
and
borden
says
that
it
never
refused
to
sell
private
label
milk
to
any
customer
so
long
as
it
had
productive
capacity
available,
and
that
is
not
disputed
in
this
record.
but
it
is
also
undisputed
however
that
borden
did
not
disclose
the
availability
of
the
private
label
milk
to
all
of
its
borden
plant
customers.
it
--
at
page
741
of
the
record,
there's
an
exhibit
which
is
a
letter
from
borden's
merchandizing
manager
for
evaporated
milk
in
which
he
instructs
the
atlanta
office
of
borden
that
brokers
are
not
to
discuss
the
terms
of
private
label
milk
sales
with
customers
and
that
all
inquiries
are
to
be
referred
to
the
home
office.
and
at
page
826
of
the
record
is
a
another
letter
sent
out
by
the
borden
merchandizing
manager
in
which
he
says
and
this
is
at
page
827,
“we
are
in
a
position
to
take
on
a
few
more
selected
accounts.
naturally,
we
prefer
to
deal
with
the
best
and
the
ones
that
can
do
us
the
most
good.
we
certainly
don't
want
to
end
up
by
soliciting
a
bunch
of
peanut
accounts.”
now,
the
commission
went
on
to
reject
the
cost
justification
which
borden
had
offered
on
the
basis
of
an
accounting
analysis
and
that
also
is
not
at
issue.
i
would
say
that
this
case
was
very
much
likely
in
anheuser-busch
case,
at
363
u.s.
because
the
court
below
here
did
not
reach
either
the
injury
to
competition
or
the
cost
justification,
or
even
the
form
of
the
order
that
all
of
these
points
were
raised
below.
what
the
court
did
was
to
foreclose
the
inquiry
at
the
threshold
issue
of
whether
the
goods
were
of
like
grade
and
quality.
we
think
this
is
very
much
like
anheuser-busch
because
there
the
question
was
whether
or
not
there
was
a
discrimination
in
price?
the
court
said
that
that
was
a
threshold
issue.
that
there
was
no
--
there
were
no
over
tones
of
business
backordering
out
of
the
conclusion
of
the
discrimination
in
price
and
that
the
--
it
was
in
fact
a
non
directive
phrase.
now,
we're
really
dealing
here
with
the
other
half
of
that
phrase
because
the
conclusion
that
the
goods
are
of
like
grade
and
quality,
simply
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
discrimination
in
price.
the
questions
of
injury
to
competition
and
the
cost
justification
defenses
which
we
contend
think
are
the
important
issues
for
this
case
on
its
facts
are
over
beyond
this
threshold
issue.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
exactly.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
exactly.
we
think
however
that
this
is
also
an
important
case
for
the
commission
because
without
the
finding
of
discrimination
--
without
the
ability
to
find
discrimination
in
a
situation
where
you
have
a
private
label
milk
and
an
advertised
milk,
the
commission
has
foreclosed
on
the
inquiry
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
in
fact
injury
to
competition.
but
i
think
when
i
talk
about
the
legislative
history,
it
become
apparent,
this
was
not
what
congress
intended.
indeed,
we
think
that
in
order
to
appraise
the
decision
properly,
the
court
should
assume
that
there
is
forbidden
injury
to
competition
here
because
the
--
as
i
say
the
commission
found
it
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
that
issue.
on
the
narrow
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
that
goods
of
like
grade
and
quality,
there
is
no
dispute.
the
goods
are
physically
identical.
goods
or
the
milk
is
packed
according
to
the
borden
standards
irrespective
of
whether
it's
sold
as
private
label
or
borden
brand
milk.
it's
printed
exactly
identical
cans
except
for
the
label.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
an
intense
public
demand,
however,
for
the
borden
brand
milk.
it
noted
that
the
borden
brand
milk
commands
a
higher
price
at
all
levels
of
distribution,
that
it
is
well
advertised
and
promoted
and
that
there
is
a
testimony
that
the
borden
brand
--
borden
name
does
command
great
deal
of
consumer
respect.
borden
advertises
it
very
extensively
and
it
has
the
necessary
consequences
or
at
least
the
believed
consequences
of
advertising
that
it
is
accepted
by
consumers.
now
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
was
that
when
the
labels
are
proven
to
have
demonstrable,
commercial
significance,
they
“change
the
grade
of
a
product.”
it
found
that
the
label
here
had
premium
market
value
and
commercial
significance.
it
believed
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
that
consumer
preferences
be
ignored
in
determining
when
products
maybe
priced
differently.
it
believed
the
court
concluded
that
in
order
to
avoid
price
uniformity
which
would
be
in
conflict
with
the
general
policies
of
the
antitrust
laws
that
it
must
necessarily
recognize
promotional
values
under
the
expression
of
like
grade
and
quality.
the
court
did
not
focus
on
the
language.
it
found
no
help
in
the
legislative
history.
it
pointed
to
no
controlling
of
the
case
and
indeed
there
is
none.
it
believed
that
the
administrative
precedents
were
distinguishable
and
indeed,
it
found
a
conflict
between
the
commission's
approached
under
the
protection
with
the
section
2(b)
defense
that
is
the
good
faith
meeting
of
competition
defense
with
its
approach
to
this
case
and
our
position
briefly
is
that
the
court
was
in
error
on
virtually
every
one
of
those
points.
first,
we
think
that
the
language
is
quite
clearly
in
--
quite
clearly
supports
the
commission's
position.
that
when
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
you
find
indeed
that
congress
did
have
this
problem
presented
to
it
and
it
rejected
the
opportunity
to
do
what
the
court
of
appeals
here
did.
third,
we
think
that
the
choice
which
congress
exercised
makes
good
sense
because
it
prevents
foreclosing
the
inquiry
before
we
reach
the
important
questions
to
whether
or
not
competition
is
injured.
and
finally,
we
think
that
this
construction
which
the
commission
advanced
in
this
case
is
a
view
that
it
has
held
consistently
since
1936
to
change
it
now
in
our
view
would
open
the
very
dangerous
that
congress
was
afraid
of
when
it
refused
to
make
an
allowance
for
brands
when
it
passed
the
robinson-patman
act.
and
in
the
absence
of
some
record
that
the
commission's
construction
to
which
it
has
adhered
since
1936
and
caused
some
kind
of
economic
harm
we
think
that
that
construction
should
be
given
great
weight.
turning
first
to
the
language
which
we
do
not
argue
is
necessarily
decisive.
we
think
nevertheless
it
clearly
supports
us.
the
whole
notion
of
greater
quality
it
seems
to
us
is
in
conflict
with
the
idea
of
promotional
values
because
promotional
values
may
very
well
reflect
an
erroneous
review
of
the
products'
physical
attributes
and
the
commission
thinks
that
grade
and
quality
means
physical
attributes.
i
think
that
we
took
an
example,
if
i
had
two
cans
of
milk
here
and
they
were
perfectly
identical
and
that's
all
we
knew
about
them
and
i
asked
whether
they
were
like
grade
and
quality,
i
think
it
would
be
unanimously
responded
but
of
course
they
were
of
like
grade
and
quality.
if
knowing
just
that
and
nothing
more,
i
then
added
a
label
to
one
which
said
borden
and
to
the
other
which
said
smiths
and
we
were
told
that
consumers
were
willing
to
pay
more
for
the
borden
can
of
milk,
i
think
the
reaction
would
be
not
that
the
borden
milk
is
of
higher
grade
and
quality
but
that
the
consumers
are
under
misapprehension.
they
don't
understand
that
physically
they
are
the
same.
and
borden
put
in
the
record
a
survey
which
it
conducted
at
page
24
and
25
of
volume
1
of
the
record
and
housewives
were
asked
for
why
they
--
for
reasons
as
to
why
they
preferred
the
borden
brand
and
if
you
look
at
those
reasons,
you
see
that
they
are
almost
unanimously
physical
attributes.
they
thought
it
was
creamier,
but
it
didn't
have
a
can
of
taste,
that
it
didn't
sour,
that
they
liked
the
flavor
better,
one
said
it
was
heavier,
and
one
said
it
was
lighter,
one
said
it
was
thick
and
it
didn't
have
a
canny
taste.
now,
these
are
all
physical
attributes
and
what
borden
is
in
effect
asking
here
what
the
court
of
appeals
rule
is
that
we
make
a
circle
through
the
consumer's
misapprehension
that
there
is
a
difference.
we
are
now
to
conclude
that
this
changes
the
grade
and
quality
and
that
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
there
are
two
observations
that
need
to
be
made
in
that
connection.
if
that
is
correct
then
that
is
in
effect
of
the
confession
of
error
because
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
they
were
identical
and
what
this
is,
is
an
argument
that
they
are
physically
different,
but
as
to
the
precise
question
as
to
what
the
record
shows
on
it,
the
record
shows
that
borden's
salesmen,
it
had
some
200
retail
representatives,
who
traveled
around
among
the
stores
and
offered
this
service
turning
the
cans
and
looked
over
every
30
days
or
actually
not
i
mean
30
days.
the
testimony
was
that
it
needed
to
be
done
every
30
days
that
the
salesmen
got
around
anywhere
from
four
to
six
weeks
and
did
try
to
turn
the
cases
over,
tried
to
turn
the
cans
of
milk
over
to
keep
the
milk
from
coagulating.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
this
was
with
the
borden
brand.
however,
one
important
or
two
important
qualifications.
those
salesmen
did
not
visit
stores
according
to
the
testimony
where
the
volume
of
sales
did
not
worth
their
visiting
stores
and
there
is
a
testimony
that
at
least
in
one
district,
that
volume
say
the
stores
doing
over
$200,000
worth
of
business
a
year.
so
that
if
there
was
a
difference,
if
there
was
a
difference
in
this
milk,
it
only
took
place
in
those
large
and
–
stores
and
those
large
customers.
furthermore,
many
of
the
chain
stores
according
to
the
testimony
would
not
let
the
salesmen
in
the
stores
at
all
so
that
that
argument
as
to
the
difference
in
the
milk
as
it
actually
reached
the
consumer
pursuant
to
some
borden
guarantee
is
only
applicable,
(a)
to
the
large
stores
and
(b)
to
the
--
those
chain
stores
where
a
borden's
representatives
were
permitted
in
a
store
and
then
i
might
add
that
it
really
is
a
confession
of
error
because
it
means
that
the
milk
is
different.(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes,
except
that
borden
is
supplying
an
additional
service
with
it
which
is
--
which
tends
to
keep
it
that
way.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
no.
it
was
directed
to
cost
justification.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes.
that
is
--
that
is
the
way
it
was
offered
and
that
was
the
way
it
was
considered
by
the
commission
as
part
of
the
cost
justification
defense.
any
way
it
seems
to
me
that
the
language
supports
the
commission's
construction
like
grade
and
quality
has
that
common
kind
of
tension,
the
physical
difference,
but
turning
to
the
legislative
history,
we
find
that
it
conflicts
with
the
notion
that
brand
differences
can
lead
to
differences
in
the
grade
and
quality.
the
problem
was
pointed
out
at
page
355
of
the
house
here
and
it
is
now
--
we
don't
have
this
citation
for
this
point
in
our
brief,
but
i've
advised
counsel
that
i
intended
to
refer
to
it.
at
355
of
the
house
hearings,
a
witness
pointed
out
that
the
like
grade
and
quality
language
would
interfere
with
the
sale
of
well-known
and
private
label
brands
at
different
prices.
it
was
suggested
that
this
might
be
taken
care
of
under
the
advertising
allowance
provision
but
the
witness
felt
that
it
ought
to
be
taken
care
of
in
connection
with
the
like
grade
and
quality
phrase.
the
next
day
at
the
hearings,
a
proposal
was
made
to
remedy
that
defect.
the
--
a
witness
offered
an
amendment
so
that
the
phrase
would
read
like
grade
and
quality
end
brands.
we
suggest
that
the
effect
of
that
amendment
would
have
been
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
here
decided
that
is
in
this
case
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
these
were
unlike
brands.
it
said
that
it
wasn't
just
a
question
of
attaching
the
label,
but
that
these
were
labels
of
some
significance
and
so
in
effect,
it
ruled
that
they
were
unlike
brands.
now
that
would
have
been
the
effect
of
the
amendment,
had
it
been
accepted
by
congress.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes,
that
is
what
i
was
saying
that
it
in
effect
held
that
they
were
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
i
think
not
because
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well
i
take
it
that
if
the
brand
is
to
be
compared
with
smith
and
jones
both
unknown
brands
even
though
they
were
not
identical,
they
would
not
be
considered
to
like
brands
but
there
would
be
a
significant
--
i
mean,
i'm
sorry,
that
they
would
be
considered
like
brands,
that
there
would
be
no
significant
difference
between
them.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that's
the
way
i
would
read
it.
and
in
any
event,
mr.
teegarden
who
had
been
the
--
according
to
the
legislative
history,
very
clearly
the
draftsman
of
the
proposed
patent
bill
and
who
was
counsel
for
the
united
states
wholesale
grocers
association,
responded
with
the
letter
to
the
committee
in
which
he
said,
that
to
add
the
idea
and
the
brands
to
the
phrase
“like
grade
and
quality”
would
be
to
destroy
the
efficacy
of
the
bill
against
large
buyers.”
he
said
that
under
the
bill
as
it
stood,
“sellers
were
still
free
to
make
private
brands,
but
if
they
did
so
for
one,
they
must
be
ready
to
do
so
on
the
same
terms
for
everybody.”
the
manner
then
came
up
on
the
floor
during
the
debate
and
we've
quoted
both
this
and
the
teegarden
letter
in
our
brief.
the
teegarden
letter
is
at
pages
14
and
15
of
our
brief
and
the
colloquy
on
the
floor
is
at
pages
13
and
14
of
our
brief
and
i'd
like
to
read
it,
it's
very
brief.
mr.
taylor
of
south
carolina
said,
“there
has
grown
up
of
practice
on
the
part
of
manufacturers
of
making
certain
brands
of
goods
for
particular
chain
stores.
is
there
anything
in
this
bill
calculated
to
remedy
that
situation?”
mr.
patman
then
said,
“i
have
no
time
to
discuss
that
feature,
but
the
bill
will
protect
the
independent
in
that
way
because
they
will
have
to
sell
to
the
independents
at
the
same
price
for
the
same
product
where
they
put
the
same
quality
of
merchandise
in
a
package
and
this
will
remedy
the
situation
to
which
the
gentleman
refers.”
and
mr.
taylor
of
south
carolina
then
said,
“irrespective
of
the
brand”
and
mr.
patman
said,
“yes,
so
long
as
it
is
in
the
same
quality.”
now
at
the
minimum,
that
shows
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
distinction
between
brands
and
quality
and
in
all
of
these
passages,
congressman
and
the
witnesses
are
talking
about
private
label
or
other
brand
merchandises
compared
to
the
national
advertised
brands.
none
of
them
suggests
that
nationally
advertised
brands
would
not
be
of
like
grade
and
quality
with
local
or
off
brands
or
private
label.
all
of
them
are
assuming
that
they
will
be
treated
alike
under
the
statute.
now,
i
would
point
out
also
that
this
congressional
refusal
to
make
special
exception
for
brand
differences
makes
pretty
good
sense
and
it
should
prevail
even
if
the
language
and
the
legislative
history
were
less
clear.
first
at
the
primary
level
that
is
competition
with
the
seller,
there
is
a
clear
possibility
of
use
of
private
brands
as
what
used
to
be
called
fighting
brands,
a
practice
of
which
the
original
1914
clayton
act
was
aimed,
as
well
as
the
robinson-patman
act.
all
that
needs
to
be
done
is
that
the
seller
puts
out
a
quality
product
at
a
low
price
but
calls
it
brand
x
where
he
wants
to
defeat
his
competitors,
meanwhile,
holding
up
the
market
for
his
well-known
brand
name
by
the
heavy
advertising
which
he
has
done.
at
the
secondary
level
which
was
the
particular
focus
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
it
would
be
similarly
easy
to
give
in
to
the
demands
of
large
customers
that
they
have
a
special
brand
made
available
to
them
while
smaller
customers
who
were
unable
to
pressure
the
seller
could
be
turned
away.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
at
the
same
--
on
the
same
terms
i
think
not.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
the
commission
would
not
be
here
in
those
circumstances
and
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
well,
excuse
me.
i
should
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
i
mis-answered
justice's
question.
at
the
primary
level,
there
is
still
a
question
of
whether
or
not,
the
relationship
between
the
prices
and
the
practices
in
a
particular
market
setting
would
constitute
a
violation
to
robinson-patman
act
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
in
this
case
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
let
me
say
this.
the
order
in
this
case
is
a
secondary
line
order.
it
prohibits
selling
at
different
prices
to
competing
purchasers
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that
is
correct
and
that's
a
very
difficult
question
which
is
not
before
the
court
at
this
time
but
i
might
say
this
that
the
order
in
this
case
is
purely
a
secondary
line
order.
and
before
the
court
of
appeals,
the
commission
in
an
authorized
brief
conceded
that
if
borden
made
the
private
label
milk
equally
available
to
all
competing
purchasers,
then
it
would
not
be
considered
a
violation
of
the
order.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that's
the
--
that's
the
threshold
issue.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
so
far
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
in
part,
that's
just
a
threshold
question
because
the
--
the
next
question
is
whether
there
was
injury
to
competition.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
we
think
this
is
in
sum
the
problem
under
the
court's
construction.
we
have
an
all
or
none
construction
of
the
statute.
if
you
establish
that
the
brand
is
--
has
some
consumer
acceptance
and
how
you
--
objectively
how
you
set
that
is
not
clear
over
and
beyond
the
private
label
goods,
then
the
threshold
question
is
decided
against
the
commission's
construction.
it
never
reaches
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
the
practice
might
injure
competition
either
at
the
primary
or
the
secondary
level.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
before
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well
first
of
all,
the
order
only
covers
secondary.
the
instance
where
there
might
be
secondary
line
injury
it
says
to
competing
purchasers.
second,
as
we
--
as
we
note,
before
the
court
of
appeals,
the
commission
conceded
that
there
would
be
no
disfavored
purchasers
if
everybody
could
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
buy
the
private
label
milk.
i'm
not
sure,
does
that
--
whether
that
answers
your
honor's
question.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
any
purchaser
who
in
fact
competes
with
the
purchaser
paying
higher
prices.
now
that
--
that
limits
it
to
the
secondary
line
situation.
and
secondly,
the
commission
conceded
that
you
could
--
you
could
hardly
claim
a
discrimination
with
respect
to
a
purchaser
who
had
an
opportunity
to
buy
the
milk
at
the
lower
price.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes,
to
buy
both.
that
is
in
other
words,
borden
customers
must
be
treated
equally.
they
all
must
know
that
the
milk
is
available
and
have
the
opportunity
to
buy
it
on
equal
terms.
this
we
think
as
what
the
--
thus
assuming
that
the
failure
to
do
so
would
cause
injury
and
assuming
that
the
price
difference
could
not
be
cost
justified.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
it
does
not
say
that.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well
i
may
say
also
that
the
order
has
not
been
--
the
problem
with
the
order
has
not
been
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
either.
it's
deprived
of
the
order.
and
we
have
assumed
that
it
was
not
within
the
question
of
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well
it
is
our
position
that
assuming
the
final
competitive
injury,
then
it
must
be
made
available
to
all
competitive
purchasers
on
equal
terms.
that
means
that
the
--
if
there
is
a
price
discrepancy
between
the
two,
between
the
private
label
and
the
borden
brand
milk,
that
all
customers
must
have
the
opportunity,
all
customers
for
the
borden
brand
must
also
have
the
opportunity
to
buy
a
private
label
milk
comparable
for
this.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
i
agree
with
--
i
agree
with
the
point.
i
would
quibble
with
somewhat
as
to
the
terms.
we
would
say
that
there
were
no
disfavored
purchasers.
in
fact,
no
one
was
being
discriminated
against
it
for
all
purchasers
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
--
but
the
point
if
i
would
agree
with
you
exactly.
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
the
economic
value
between
the
borden
over
the
economic
value
--
the
difference
of
economic
value
between
the
borden
brand
and
the
private
label
milk.
it
is
something
that
must
be
ignored
if
the
court
of
appeals
maybe
stray
in
part
on
that
issue.
the
point
is
where
your
consideration
of
these
problems
does
the
commission
and
should
the
courts
take
account
of
those
economic
differences.
and
we
say
in
short,
like
grade
and
quality
is
not
the
part
of
the
statute
which
should
be
the
basis
for
that
solution
of
that
problem.
we
think
it's
--
as
i
said
summing
up
finally
that
the
language
is
clear,
the
legislative
history
if
anything
reenforces
the
language.
the
commission
has
been
construing
the
statute
just
this
way
since
1936
and
that
in
order
to
keep
the
focus
of
this
statute
where
it
belongs
with
this
court
indicated
in
anheuser-busch
that
it
belongs,
that
is
on
the
injury
to
competition
and
on
the
cost
justification
problems.
this
difference
in
the
economic
value
of
the
advertised
brand
and
the
private
label
milk
should
not
be
given
recognition
under
the
like
grade
and
quality
test.
accordingly,
we
ask
that
the
case
be
reversed
and
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
determination
of
other
questions
in
the
case.
i
would
like
to
save
five
minutes
for
possible
rebuttal.
