mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
main
point
for
which
i
argue
today,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
fully
consonant
with
the
objective
of
the
robinson-patman
act
to
protect
against
harmful
use
of
the
buying
power
of
large
purchasers
and
at
the
same
time
avoids
the
error
of
giving
to
the
act
a
reading
which
would
have
any
competitive
effects
inconsistent
with
the
basic
antitrust
policies
laid
down
by
congress.
i
think
it's
important
at
the
outset
that
i
was
asking
the
court
to
focus
on
three
main
points
of
facts
about
this
case
because
they
help
to
define
just
what
the
court
below
decided
and
help
to
lay
aside
matters
which
the
court
below
did
not
decide
and
which
not
--
would
not
be
involved
in
an
affirmance
of
that
decision.
the
first
of
these
points
of
facts
and
i
don't
believe
there's
any
question
about
any
of
the
uses
between
part,
this
dichotomy
between
the
premium
brands
and
private
labels
in
the
evaporated
milk
business
is
something
that
which
has
existed
in
the
evaporated
milk
business
for
great
many
years.
it
was
not
created
by
the
borden
company.
it
didn't
come
into
existence
as
a
result
of
the
prices
complained
of
in
this
case.
it
was
a
situation
which
the
borden
company
based
as
having
been
in
existence
for
years
when
it
was
invited
to
supply
private
label
milk
to
customers.
these
premium
brands
borden,
carnation,
pet
offered
on
a
national
basis
of
having
wide
national
demand,
commanding
a
premium
price
in
the
market.
and
along
side
of
those
for
years,
had
been
the
products
of
a
number
of
manufacturers
who
have
specialized
in
private
label
production
in
the
maine
and
they've
packed
milk
for
various
wholesalers
or
retailers
under
the
labels
belonging
to
those
wholesalers
or
retailers.
these
private
labeled
products
were
less
acceptable
to
the
public
than
the
premium
brands
and
if
they
were
to
be
sold
at
all,
it
had
to
be
sold
at
a
lower
price
in
the
premium
brand.
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
on
that.
the
court
below
found
that
in
effect.
the
wholesalers
and
retailers
who
were
the
customers
of
the
private
label
or
the
premium
brand
packers
knew
that
they
would
have
to
resell
the
product
for
a
lesser
price
than
they
could
resell
the
premium
brands.
and
therefore,
they
were
only
willing
to
buy
them
if
they
could
get
to
them
at
a
lesser
price.
the
matter
was
summed
up
colorably
if
somewhat
ungrammatically
by
one
of
the
chief
retailer
witnesses
for
the
commission.
he
said,
“private
label
is
no
good
for
nobody
unless
there's
a
price
on
it”
and
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
differential
in
his
experience
has
to
be
from
$1.50
to
$2.00
a
case
which
by
the
way
the
hearing
examiner
found
was
greater
than
any
differential
involved
in
the
borden
company's
pricing
and
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
retailers
in
this
area
hadn't
been
much
interested
in
it.
the
point
of
this,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
that
the
premium
brands
where
a
standard
item
bought
by
virtually
all
grocers,
the
private
labels
were
paralleling
these
at
lower
prices
bought
by
some
customers
but
not
by
all
desired
by
some
customers,
but
not
desired
by
all,
and
the
distinction
between
them
was
genuine
and
firmly
rooted
at
all
levels
of
this
distribution.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i'll
get
that
information.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
there
is
a
at
--
in
volume
3
of
the
record
at
page
809,
there
is
a
stipulation
which
lists
customers
of
borden's
private
label
evaporated
milk
at
several
pages
and
then
in
the
same
stipulation
beginning
at
815,
it
lists
customers
for
the
borden
brand.
i'm
not
sure
that
they
constitute
all
the
customers
in
that
stipulation.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
you
mean
what
percentage
of
the
borden
company's
evaporated
milk
business
or
the
percentage
of
purchases
of
the
customers?
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i'll
see
if
we
can
find
that
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
white.
i
don't
have
that
for
memory.
a
second
matter
of
fact
which
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
has
to
do
with
the
suggestion
that
were
made
by
mr.
hummel
that
this
preference
of
the
consumers
for
borden
brand,
the
strong
consumers
preference
were
perhaps
just
all
misapprehension
on
their
part.
i
would
not
have
the
court
think
that
the
standing
of
the
borden
brand
product
in
the
marketplace
and
most
particularly
among
the
consumers
because
that's
what
governs
here
was
something
that
was
based
simply
on
the
work
of
madison
avenue
and
the
facts
on
these
are
very
clear.
for
the
many
years
that
the
borden
company
has
been
making
and
selling
borden
brand
evaporated
milk,
it
has
taken
extensive
and
expensive
steps
to
make
sure
that
the
product
reaches
the
hands
of
the
ultimate
consumer
in
this
nearly
possible
as
possible
perfect
condition.
and
they
have
done
things
in
this
regard
which
as
a
practical
manner
is
not
feasible
for
them
to
do
with
respect
to
private
label
milk.
now,
evaporated
milk
is
perishable.
it
cannot
be
kept
too
long.
when
it
is
stored,
it
must
be
kept
in
carefully
controlled
conditions
as
to
temperature.
if
these
things
are
not
properly
taken
care
of,
the
milk
will
become
lumpy
and
stringy,
crystals
of
mineral
substance
will
form
in
the
milk,
color
will
turn,
and
it
will
be
generally
unacceptable
to
any
user.
now
regard
against
these
things,
the
borden
company
has
taken
a
number
of
important
steps.
first,
it
provides
during
the
period
of
this
record,
the
number
was
15
cold
storage
warehouses
at
proper
locations
throughout
the
country.
so
that
the
milk
can
be
kept
under
carefully
controlled
conditions
and
that
doesn't
mean
under
the
same
temperature
everyday
because
as
they
move
it
nearer
to
the
point
of
exit
from
the
warehouse,
the
temperature
has
to
be
modified.
and
this
is
an
elaborate
and
painstaking
operation
to
make
sure
that
the
milk
is
properly
cared
for
while
it
is
kept
in
storage.
beyond
that,
the
company
operates
under
rigid
requirements
as
to
the
time
of
shipment
of
milk
that
first
packed
first
shipped
is
the
rule
and
even
though
that
means
shipping
milk
across
the
country
rather
than
shipping
it
from
the
nearest
warehouse,
that
practice
is
followed.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
if
that
isn't
done,
milk
will
tend
to
be
backed
up
in
some
warehouse
and
becomes
stale
or
unusable
for
some
reason.
and
then
when
the
milk
has
gotten
into
the
hands
of
the
--
the
retail
grocery,
well
theoretically,
borden
has
nothing
more
to
do
with
it.
the
company
follows
it
there
and
these
200
men
that
mr.
hummel
referred
to
go
into
the
stores,
they
check
as
to
the
age
of
the
milk,
on
occasion
they
open
cans
to
see
what
condition
the
milk
is
actually
in,
they
check
with
the
store
rooms
to
make
sure
that
the
milk
is
rotated
out
in
the
store
in
the
proper
way
so
as
to
prevent
it
being
backed
up.
this
isn't
just
turning
cans
over
every
30
days,
may
it
please
the
court,
it's
vastly
more
than
that.
and
these
steps
having
been
carried
on
for
years,
have
given
to
the
customers
throughout
the
country
assurance
that
when
they
buy
a
borden
brand
milk,
they're
getting
something
that
is
in
the
same
condition
as
nearly
as
possible
in
which
it
was
when
it
was
put
into
the
can
in
effect.
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i
think
the
record
is
not
explicit
as
to
the
financial
aspects,
the
milk
is
not
sold.
the
milk
is
disposed
off.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
i
mean,
it's
not
sold
to
a
consumer.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
it
comes
off
the
shelf.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i
assume
mr.
chief
justice
it
has
no
legal
authority
but
if
the
man
says
to
the
proprietor
of
the
store,
this
milk
is
not
fit
to
be
sold,
i'll
give
you
another
case.
it
doesn't
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i
cannot
represent
that
the
record
shows
that
fact.
i
believe
that
is
the
fact.
it
happens
within
the
testimony
of
the
question
of
what
was
done
if
some
unfit
milk
was
discovered,
you
would
not
ask.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
sir.
only
to
borden
brand
milk.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
it's
a
--
it
is
canned
only
on
the
receipt
of
an
order
which
may
contemplate
shipments
over
a
period
of
time
but
it
is
shipped
out
not
immediately
upon
its
being
packed.
it
will
be
held
a
reasonable
time
at
the
plant
for
the
customer
to
come
to
get
it.
but
i
was
going
to
explain
your
honor
that
the
difference
as
to
the
private
label
packed
by
borden
is
that
as
to
that
product,
the
borden
company
washes
its
hands
off
it
at
the
factory
door.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
sir.
it
sold
fob
of
the
plant.
the
customer
comes
and
takes
it
away.
the
customer
is
the
owner
of
the
private
label
and
it's
his
product,
his
goodwill
that's
involved
in
that
label
and
he
decides
where
to
ship
it
and
how.
he
decides
where
to
store
it
and
how
and
for
how
long.
he
decides
what
to
do
about
it
through
the
channels
of
distribution.
some
of
them
may
decide
those
questions
one
way.
some
may
decide
them
the
other
way.
the
consequence
is
that
in
the
private
label
business,
there
is
no
assurance
that
the
care
is
taken
with
milk
that
it
needs
to
be
held
and
given
to
it
according
to
the
borden
company's
experience.
now,
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
relationship
between
the
packer
of
private
label
such
as
borden
or
some
other
company
and
the
owner
of
the
private
label
is
not
a
long-term
contract
relationship
or
an
exclusive
contract
relationship.
the
borden
company
may
pack
private
label
with
some
wholesaler
today.
somebody
else
may
that
pack
milk
for
him
tomorrow
and
indeed,
the
record
shows
instances
when
at
the
same
time
the
owner
of
a
private
label
was
obtaining
his
milk
for
those
private
labeled
cans
from
different
suppliers.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
the
most
succinct
some
reactive
use,
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
–
is
that
the
hearing
examiner
found
that
borden
had
never
refused
to
make
private
label
available
to
anybody
who
asked
for
it.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
whatever
the
quantity
that
was
asked
for
and
it
was
supplied
to
all
big
or
small
at
the
same
price
out
of
the
same
plant.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
the
examiner.
the
commission
made
no
contrary
finding.
the
commission
did
not
discuss
that
question
in
the
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
they
set
aside
the
whole
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
commission
made
no
contrary
finding
that
this
one
of
the
hearing
examiner.
now
as
to
the
evidence,
according
to
the
hearing
examiner's
finding,
it
is
clear
that
i
submit
on
the
evidence
that
the
borden
company
stood
ready
to
pack
private
label
milk
for
anybody
who
wanted
it
on
even
terms
at
all
times.
it
--
it
is
also
clear
that
the
company
did
not
actively
seek
the
business.
it
did
not
send
salesmen
out
ringing
doorbells,
asking
people
to
buy
private
label.
it
promoted
its
borden
brand
milk.
it
treated
the
private
label
business
as
something
to
be
done
to
the
extent
that
there
was
a
demand
for
it.
now,
the
testimony
of
the
wholesalers
or
retailers
which
was
presented
before
the
hearing
examiner
is
very
interesting.
they
all
came
from
the
southeastern
part
of
the
country,
the
south
carolina
and
north
carolina
i
believe.
they
were
men
who
were
in
an
area
in
which
private
label
evaporated
milk
had
been
sold
for
at
least
30
years.
everybody
knew
it
and
almost
without
exception,
they
hadn't
bothered
to
buy
any
from
anybody.
one
of
them
had
bought
some
from
railroad
salvage
a
few
times.
another
one
had
bought
some
from
the
armor
and
company
in
chicago
for
a
brief
period
of
time
but
he
discontinued
that.
this
man
who
said
that
private
label
--
private
label
is
no
good
for
nobody
unless
there's
a
price
on
it,
says
that
the
retailers
in
his
area
have
not
been
much
interested
in
it.
two
of
them,
i
believe,
it
is
have
started
buying
from
the
borden
company
just
before
they
testified.
and
they
bought
some
six
months
in
one
case
and
18
months
in
the
other
case
after
they
were
solicited
by
a
wholesaler
grocer
to
whom
borden
was
selling
private
label
milk.
i
say
to
the
court
confidently
that
the
record
does
not
support
in
any
substantial
way,
a
contention
that
the
borden
company
has
refused
to
sell
private
label
milk
to
anybody
or
has
failed
to
make
it
generally
available
to
anybody
who
wanted
it.
and
as
i
say,
the
commission
has
made
no
finding
contrary
to
what
i
have
said.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
one
consequence
your
honor
is
that
as
we
contended
below
and
as
the
hearing
examiner
found
that
there
would
be
no
possible
contention
of
competitive
injury
at
the
secondary
--
at
the
secondary
level.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
these
facts
wouldn't
bear
on
the
primary
line.
as
to
the
primary
line,
i
just
may
comment.
the
record
shows
that
some
of
the
private
label
packers
in
the
midwest
lost
some
business
to
the
borden
company
when
it
began
packing
private
label
at
two
of
its
plants
in
south,
chester,
south
carolina
and
lewisburg,
tennessee.
customers
located
near
those
plants,
who
had
been
buying
evaporated
milk
from
firms
out
in
wisconsin
and
kansas,
found
they
could
handle
it
much
more
cheaply
from
this
plant
that
was
near
to
their
homes
and
they
bought
for
borden
and
really
that's
what
started
this
case.
but
the
same
statistic
showed
that
these
packers
in
the
midwest
had
picked
up
business
from
other
sources
too.
and
so,
there
were
ups
and
downs
as
among
them
but
in
the
maine,
the
trend
of
their
business
was
up
during
the
period
covered
by
the
evidence.
and
in
terms
of
market
share,
there
was
no
decline
in
market
share
among
this
group
of
the
old
line
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
your
honor.
the
hearing
examiner
found
no
injury
in
either
level
in
either
line.
the
commission
found
injury
in
both
lines.
i
want
to
say
one
more
word
on
that
sir,
if
i
may,
it
asserted
that
one
of
these
packers
went
out
of
business
as
a
result
of
borden
company's
getting
into
the
private
label
business.
the
difficulty
with
that
proposition
is
that
he
was
asked
where
his
problems
were
and
he
stated
them,
and
that
is
not
what
he
said.
he
was
located
out
of
the
line
in
the
midwest
where
the
freight
rates
were
adverse
to
him
in
the
territory
where
he
was
trying
to
do
business.
and
he
said
his
friends
in
ohio,
where
is
this
other
gentleman
that
the
government
says
were
being
injured,
his
friends
in
ohio
had
been
able
to
put
their
milk
down
in
the
east
to
get
in
more
cheaply
than
he
could
and
he
found
it
very
difficult
so
he
got
out
of
the
evaporated
milk
business.
and
getting
out
of
the
evaporated
milk
business
is
not
the
testimony
that
getting
out
of
business
sometimes
sounds
like,
may
it
please
the
court.
a
milk
processor
has
a
number
of
different
products
that
he
can
make,
cottage
cheese,
powdered
milk,
ice
cream
mix,
one
thing
and
another
and
his
choice
of
product
to
make
from
time
to
time
would
vary
depending
upon
the
amount
of
raw
milk
available
in
his
neighborhood,
on
price
conditions
or
these
other
things.
so
the
fact
that
people
are
in
and
out
of
the
processing
of
some
of
these
milk
products
is
not
--
does
not
signify
that
they
are
going
out
of
business.
it
simply
signifies
that
they're
adjusting
their
operations
so
as
to
get
do
the
things
that
they
regard
as
the
most
profitable.
well
as
a
result
of
this,
if
i
may
come
back
to
this
matter
of
the
quality
aspects,
after
packing,
of
course
they're
of
the
same
quality
when
they're
put
in
the
can,
there's
no
question
about
that,
the
borden
company
is
unable
to
and
does
not
seek
to
follow
this
private
label
milk
through
the
channels
of
distribution.
and
over
the
years,
other
private
labeled
packers
have
not
been
able
to
do
that.
and
the
consequence
is
that
there
cannot
be
the
assurance
that
private
label
evaporated
milk
on
the
grocery
shelves
where
the
housewife
buys,
is
as
well
cared
for,
is
indeed
in
the
same
condition
as
it
was
in
when
it
left
the
factory.
and
the
record
shows
that
consumers
have
had
unsatisfactory
experiences
with
private
label
evaporated
milk.
the
survey
which
mr.
hummel
has
referred
to
demonstrated
that
the
list
of
reasons
from
which
he
read
was
the
selection
made
by
the
hearing
examiner.
there
were
many
others
in
the
returns
and
time
after
time,
the
reasons
had
to
do
with
experiences
that
the
person
have
had
with
some
private
label
evaporated
milk,
stringy,
lumpy,
curdly,
specs
in
it,
bad
color.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
sir
and
although
it
makes
sense
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i
don't
believe
that
as
the
record
does
show
that.
incidentally,
the
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
to
safeway
warehouses.
i
should
say
your
honor
safeway,
i
think
packs
most
of
its
own
private
label
milk.
it
has
its
own
plants
as
to
be
most
of
the
national
chains
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
--and
the
--
it
relies
on
outside
packers
only
to
a
limited
extent.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
your
honor
and
i
have
this
quite
bit
of
information
although
it's
not
before
the
court
to
be
proved
to
our
own
satisfaction
and
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
hearing
examiner
that
we
more
than
cost
justify
this
differential
by
a
considerable
margin.
that
is
not
before
the
court
to
do
that.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
only
in
part.
i
have
to
explain
that
in
the
distribution
system
after
the
milk
left
these
cold
storage
warehouses
that
i
have
referred
to,
there
was
also
a
network
of
so-called
consignment
warehouses
which
were
nearer
to
the
location
of
where
the
customers
would
be.
milk
could
be
sold
out
of
those
consignment
warehouses
without
any
arrangements
with
the
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i
thought
you
were
referring
only
to
borden
brand.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
i
think
that's
correct.
the
arrangements
--
the
arrangements
were
made
at
the
home
office.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
at
least
in
a
number
of
cases,
it
was
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i
think
that
was
an
isolated
situation
and
if
i
read
this
correctly
your
honor,
this
had
to
do
in
part
at
least
with
compensation
to
a
broker
and
that
was
one
of
the
sore
points
in
the
management
of
the
company
when
they
sold
that
borden
brand
milk
in
certain
areas
of
the
country
where
they
engaged
brokers,
the
broker
received
a
broker's
fee.
in
handling
of
the
private
label
milk,
they
did
not
use
the
brokers,
they
made
the
arrangements
directly
with
the
customer
but
the
brokers
wanted
a
fee
and
they
had
to
do
some
negotiating
and
they
got
the
fee
reduced
to
half
of
the
standard
fee,
but
they
didn't
like
to
have
the
brokers'
even
inquiring
about
it
and
i
think
that's
part
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
record
will
show
this
completely
but
i
think
it
will
show
it
to
a
considerable
extent.
all
the
people
who
bought
private
label
milk
from
borden
were
also
buying
borden
brand
milk
and
were
probably
also
buying
carnation
and
pet.
though
the
carnation
and
pet
and
borden
were
standard
items
that
almost
every
wholesale
grocer
certainly
had
in
his
rooms
and
many
of
the
larger
retailers
would
have.
and
they
bought
the
private
label
not
as
a
substitute
for
the
premium
brand,
this
is
one
of
the
key
facts
in
this
case.
when
that
they
thought
they
were
getting
the
same
thing
for
less
money,
they
knew
they
were
getting
what
was
in
commercial
fact
a
different
product
and
they
kept
right
on
buying
and
the
hearing
examiner
found
this
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
it.
they
kept
right
on
buying
the
borden
brand
in
undiminished
qualities
after
they
began
to
buy
the
private
label.
so
that
this
was
not
a
case
of
getting
something
just
as
good
for
less
money.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
it's
true
that
they
tried
to
confine
their
activities
as
far
as
possible
to
stores
doing
a
volume
of
$200,000
a
year
or
more.
that's
not
$200,000
a
year
for
evaporated
milk
and
it's
not
$200,000.00
a
year
for
borden
products.
it's
$200,000
a
year
for
everything
that
store
handled
and
it
would
be
a
very
small
grocery
store
that
didn't
move
$200,000
worth
of
goods
a
year.
so
that
is
not
a
significant
limitation
on
the
availability
of
that
service
your
honor.
i
must
move
to
my
third
main
point
of
fact
that
i
want
to
stress
because
i
think
this
has
a
fundamental
bearing
on
the
approach
of
this
case.
the
packing
of
private
label
milk
by
the
borden
company
was
in
no
sense
a
favoring
of
large
buyers
over
small
ones
and
that's
why
i
say
with
so
much
confidence
that
the
decision
in
this
case
is
consonant
with
the
basic
objective
of
the
robinson-patman
act
to
prevent
the
favoring
of
large
buyers
over
small.
no
distinctions
were
made
at
all
by
borden
in
between
the
large
customers
and
the
small
in
selling
evaporated
milk,
the
private
label
or
borden
brand.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
no,
sir.
but
he's
very
liable
to
buy
from
a
wholesaler
who
would
have
a
private
brand
and
many
of
the
customers
to
whom
borden
sold
private
label
milk
were
wholesalers,
who
were
serving
the
independent
grocer,
the
small
grocer.
also,
many
of
the
customers
where
borden
sold
were
buying
groups
who
were
buying
for
the
independent
grocers.
and
there
was
no
distinction
or
whatever
made.
now
of
course
borden
sold
to
some
chains
too,
although,
as
i've
indicated
most
of
the
national
change
have
their
own
packing
plants
and
rely
on
outside
packers
only
to
a
limited
extent,
borden
sold
nothing
to
first
national
stores,
nothing
to
kroger,
nothing
to
american
stores
and
to
that
roughly
two
and
a
half
years
that
was
involved
in
the
study
in
this
case
sales
day
and
fee
of
the
private
label
amounted
to
less
than
1200
cases
out
of
over
a
billion
and
a
half
cases.
this
was
not
the
situation,
may
it
please
the
court,
of
seeking
out
the
big
chain
stores
and
saying,
“let's
make
a
special
deal
with
you
now
to
give
you
a
fancy
price.”
this
was
a
case
of
saying
to
all
commerce,
wholesalers
who
were
serving
the
small
grocer,
buying
groups
who
were
serving
the
small
grocer,
regional
chains,
any
chain,
will
pack
for
you
all
on
the
same
terms.
everybody
who
buys
in
this
plant
will
pay
us
exactly
the
same
price
at
the
factory
door.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes
your
honor
the
record
is
full
of
that.
a
company
in
the
southeast
known
as
thomas
&
howard
is
one
of
the
borden
customers.
representatives
of
that
firm
testified
in
this
case,
witnesses.
they
--
they
had
a
private
label
which
they
called
“miss
virginia”
and
they
sold
that
to
retailers
throughout
the
southeast.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
miss
virginia.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
thomas
&
howard.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
it's
for
the
wholesalers
i
think
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
they
may
have
some
affiliated
retail
stores
but
they
also
sell
them
in
the
independent
retailers
because
some
of
the
independent
retailers
who
testified
in
this
case
were
purchasers
from
thomas
&
howard.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
sir.
well,
it
was
to
some
extent
at
least.
we
don't
know
to
what
extent
thomas
&
howard
may
have
bought
it
from
somebody
else
also
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
--
or
did
make
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
borden
--
borden
made
it
for
thomas
&
howard,
and
thomas
&
howard
sold
it
to
any
retailer
who
wanted
to
buy
it
in
the
area
where
they
could
sell.
one
of
the
buying
groups
for
which
borden
packed
a
private
label
milk,
bought
there
over
a
thousand
small
retailers.
this
is
not
a
picture
of
making
special
deals
to
take
care
of
some
big
chains.
it
simply
didn't
work
that
way.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
it's
his
brand.
he
can
call
it
x,
y,
z
or
a,
b,
c
(voice

mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i
suppose
the
legal
department
might
have
trouble
with
that.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
your
honor.
it's
his
brand.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
it's
his
brand.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i'm
sure
it
does
but
i'm
not
able
to
state
what
it
is.
i'll
try
to
find
out
and
supply
the
information.
there
are
a
number
of
the
invoices
in
the
record
but
i
haven't
checked
it
for
that
particular
fact.
well,
now
i
--
a
question
was
asked
before
us
to
the
relative
volume
of
sales
by
borden
of
private
brand
and
of
its
borden
brand
and
private
label.
for
the
year
1957,
the
record
shows
and
this
is
at
page
of
volume
3
exhibit
--
on
page
894
--
895,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well
it's
very
easy
it
just
have
two
figures
and
i
have
read
the
instance
to
the
lower
court
had
realized
that
sales
by
borden
the
borden
brand
was
4,314,000
cases
of
private
label
of
1,104,000.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well
as
to
mr.
patman,
your
honor
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
he
was
certainly
one
of
the
most
and
that
or
his
name.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
sir.
i
think
--
i
must
say
with
respect
that
mr.
patman
himself
--
when
he
was
asked
this
question,
he
made
perfectly
clear
that
he
didn't
intend
to
discuss
it.
he
didn't
have
time.
the
government
quotes
part
of
the
language
but
i'd
like
to
quote
it
all.
it's
found
at
page
21
of
our
brief.
a
question
was
asked
to
him
which
mr.
hummel
read.
he
said,
“i
only
have
a
very
short
time
and
i
must
finish
my
statement,”
he
was
making
a
general
statement
about
the
bill.
“i
only
have
a
very
short
time
and
i
must
finish
my
statement.
i
have
no
time
to
discuss
that
feature”
and
then
he
brushed
it
off
(voice
overlap),
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
he
didn't
say
a
word
about
grade
and
that's
one
of
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
i'm
--
i
don't
know.
i
concede
to
your
honor.
i
don't
know
precisely
what
mr.
patman
was
saying
there.
i
think
the
statement
is
not
very
clear
and
i
submit
to
your
honor,
it's
very
difficult
to
draw
much
of
a
conclusion.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
sir
and
what
did
he
mean
by
that?
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
during
this
very
same
period,
judge
learned
hand
had
said
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
but
his
judicial
views
were
widely
read
and
he
regarded
the
grade
and
quality
as
involving
the
concept
of
public
acceptability
and
he
so
held
in
one
of
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief.
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
the
principle
point
about
the
legislative
history
here
and
the
one
that
i
would
like
most
to
address
myself
too
is
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
adopt
this
proposal
to
add
the
words
‘and
brands'
to
the
legislation.
as
the
bill
then
stood,
it
said
that
it
referred
to
commodities
of
like
grade
and
quality
and
the
proposal
was
made
to
amend
it
by
adding
the
words
‘and
brands'
and
mr.
teegarden
wrote
a
letter
which
had
put
the
congress
in
the
record
in
which
he
said
that,
“while
at
first
blast
this
seems
alright,”
it
really
isn't
and
then
he
pointed
out
that
each
brand
of
the
private
label,
it
is
--
there's
just
one
for
that
owner.
and
so
if
one
made
a
private
label
for
the
a
company
and
then
another
private
label
product
for
the
b
company,
and
then
another
private
label
for
the
great
national
c
company.
under
that
proposal,
there
could
be
complete
discrimination
among
those
buyers
and
that
would
defeat
the
purposes
of
the
act
because
in
actual
economic
market
fact,
in
most
situations,
at
least
so
far
as
evaporated
milk
is
concerned,
the
private
label
market
is
one
thing,
the
premium
brand
market
is
another,
and
things
in
the
private
label
market
tend
to
be
equated
with
each
other
and
the
refusal
of
congress
to
adopt
that
amendment,
i
submit,
does
not
suggest
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
wrong.
the
court
below
said
it
would
not
accept
the
view
that
any
change
in
labels
would
make
the
difference
as
between
grade
and
quality.
and
the
court
said,
you've
got
to
look
at
the
facts
and
there's
only
if
there
is
a
genuine,
a
real,
a
substantial
commercial
significance
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
that's
right
and
i'll
put
it
on
another
way.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i
would
say
grade
rather
than
quality.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
sir
and
putting
it
in
another
way,
i
say
that
it
really
did
not
make
much
sense
to
say
that
congress
was
going
to
mandate
the
price
uniformity
as
between
products
which
in
a
free
market
could
not
be
sold
at
uniform
prices.
on
the
facts
as
found
in
this
case,
when
the
borden
company
was
asked
to
pack
private
label
evaporated
milk,
it
would
either
have
had
to
refuse
to
do
so
or
it
would
have
had
to
sell
that
milk
at
a
lower
price
than
the
price
of
its
borden
brand
and
i
submit
that
there's
nothing
in
the
objectives
of
the
robinson-patman
act
than
nothing
in
the
language
to
justify
a
conclusion
that
congress
was
meaning
to
say
though
you
can't
sell
this
product
at
the
same
price
but
we
tell
you
that
unless
you
do
you're
going
to
be
subject
to
a
federal
trade
commission
proceeding.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
i
think
perhaps
not
so
much
if
you're
doing
kansas,
if
you
do
and
must
than
you
may.
it
must
if
you're
going
to
sell
both
products
at
all.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
effect
of
it.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
and
then
you
wouldn't
sell
anymore
private
brand,
what
the
private
label
price
then
go
so
that
--
no
on
the
facts
of
this
case
so
long
as
the
borden
company
proposes
to
sell
borden
brand
and
private
label,
the
pricing
of
private
label
has
got
to
be
lower.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
no,
i
put
it
the
other
way
around
your
honor.
the
act
does
not
mandate
price
uniformity
where
the
market
forbids
price
uniformity.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
yes,
if
there
is
a
real
and
a
genuine
market
evaluation
of
these
two
things
as
different
products.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well
an
existence
of
it
among
other
buyers
and
sellers
would
have
a
bearing,
the
length
of
time
that
it
has
been
in
effect,
the
rational
basis
for
it
or
lack
of
rational
basis.
there
are
a
number
of
factors
that
might
well
be
pertinent
in
deciding
whether
this
was
a
real
and
a
genuine
product
differentiation.
that's
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
there
were
some
other
points
that
could
have
been
made
in
that
opinion
which
i
think
was
supported.
as
to
the
language
of
the
act,
if
i
may
say
a
word
about
that,
they
say
the
--
first
i
think
it's
clear
and
i
believe
it's
common
to
the
counsel
that
this
formula
as
to
commodities
of
like
grade
and
quality
is
intended
to
be
and
it's
a
limitation
on
the
power
of
the
commission
and
its
limitation
imposed
so
as
to
prevent
having
to
dig
into
price
differentials
except
in
situations
defined
by
congress
as
calling
for
such
digging
and
it's
clear
as
counsel
for
the
commission
say
in
their
brief
that
the
commission
is
not
to
have
power
and
the
act
is
not
to
be
in
effect
with
respect
to
differentials
where
you
have
unlike
products
or
where
there's
another
place
in
the
brief
it
said
where
there
is
significant
differences.
well
that
raises
the
question,
what
likeness
in
what
respect?
what
are
significant
differences?
i
submit
your
honors
that
in
a
trade
regulation
statute
which
is
regulating
the
pricing
of
goods,
the
relevant
factors
--the
significant
factors
are
those
which
govern
the
pricing
of
goods
in
the
market.
that
congress
wasn't
legislating
to
make
sure
that
everybody
got
the
finest
quality
of
merchandize
or
to
see
to
it
that
public
health
laws
were
observed.
this
was
a
pricing
statute
and
what
is
significant
as
to
pricing
is
simply
what
as
a
matter
of
fact
governs
pricing
in
a
free
market.
now
that
maybe
physical
identity,
but
it
very
often
maybe
public
acceptability,
which
is
the
situation
that
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
no,
your
honor
my
point
is
that
the
significant
difference
is
that
if
you
can't
sell
it
at
the
same
price.
it's
not
on
the
same
grade
and
quality.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
sir.
well,
the
grade
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
no,
but
what
they're
talking
about
is
the
price
of
which
you
could
sell
it.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
and
grade
and
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes
,sir.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
to
start
with,
yes,
sir--
when
borden
sells
that
it
is.
well
the
antitrust
commentator,
some
of
them
when
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
think
of
grade
as
relating
to
marketability,
the
degree
of
acceptance
of
the
product,
quality
as
relating
to
its
inherent
physical
characteristics.
that
seems
to
be
the
use
of
the
words
which
was
adopted
by
the
commission.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
sir.
as
long
we
cited
in
our
brief
are
the
one
who
said
that.
[laughter]
now
that's
referred
to
also
in
the
brief.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
yes,
sir.
the
--
in
the
callaway
mills
case,
chairman
dixon
writing
for
the
commission
made
the
same
distinction.
that
was
one
of
these
four
goodyear
cases
where
they
were
comparing
prices
for
purposes
of
testing
whether
there
was
a
good
faith
in
meeting
competition.
and
he
said
when
the
hearing
examiner
made
the
finding
of
like
grade
and
quality
as
he
had
the
--
he
made
a
mistake
because
he
didn't
look
at
both
quality
which
is
intrinsic
characteristics
and
intends
public
demand
which
he
agreed.
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i
believe
not
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
that
the
decision
below
and
an
affirmance
of
that
decision
here
would
leave
the
commission
entirely
free
to
deal
with
the
case
you
put
because
as
i
understand
the
case
and
as
i
present
it,
we're
dealing
here
with
the
situation
where
it
was
clearly
overwhelmingly
shown
as
a
matter
of
commercial
fact
that
there
were
two
separate
markets,
it
would
be
premium
brand
market,
the
private
label
market
and
we're
dealing
here
with
the
facts
of
this
case.
now
if
a
case
arises
in
which
borden
or
somebody
else,
who
make
some
special
deals
with
the
grand
union
or
somebody,
or
if
another
goodyear
case
arises,
the
commission
can
deal
with
those
without
being
in
anyway
cramped
by
this.
and
the
illustration
of
that
is
the
case
that
is
cited
in
our
brief
in
this
very
fifth
circuit
not
long
before
this
case
was
argued
there.
they
came
down
with
a
decision
in
a
private
triple
damage
action
holding
that
two
products
were
of
like
grade
and
quality,
although,
they
bore
different
labels.
and
the
commission
said
that
that's
just
what
we
say
and
the
court
had
no
difficulty
at
all
with
that
and
judge
reeves
who
wrote
the
opinion,
in
that
other
case,
who
joined
in
the
unanimous
opinion
here.
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
you've
got
a
clear
substantial,
unquestioned
differentiation
in
the
market
between
these
products.
you
have
in
truth
and
in
fact
different
products.
in
a
situation,
where
some
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
e.
f.
wood
well,
i
suggest
not
your
honor
because
there
would
be
a
grave
suspicion
that
this
seller
was
not
undertaking
to
provide
a
general
private
label
market
which
is
what
borden
is
doing
here.
the
very
fact
that
it
picks
out
one
or
two
big
chains
and
makes
a
special
deal
with
them
it's
almost
that
they'd
give
away
that
that
is
not
the
fact.
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
expertise
of
the
federal
trade
commission
would
enable
them
to
deal
with
that
situation
very
readily.
well,
if
i
may
summarize
for
just
a
minute,
the
--
i
would
reassert
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
facts
of
this
case
is
consonant
with
the
objective
of
the
robinson-patman
act
and
it
is
pro-competitor.
the
borden
company
has
not
discriminated
at
all
as
among
the
borden
brand
customers.
there's
no
question
about
that.
it
has
not
discriminated
at
all
among
the
private
label
customers
and
there's
no
question
about
that.
the
products
are
evaluated
in
the
market
as
being
different
products
and
there's
no
question
about
that.
now
a
reversal,
an
announcement
that
the
borden
company
could
only
engage
in
the
distribution
of
private
label
milk
at
the
peril
of
facing
a
federal
trade
commission
proceeding
would
be
to
say,
“you'd
better
stratify
this
industry.”
let
the
--
let
the
borden,
the
premium
brand
producers
stick
to
their
daily
rate.
let
the
other
stick
to
theirs
and
let's
not
have
competition
between
them.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
a
decision
which
would
have
that
implication
ought
not
to
be
rendered
unless
it
is
clearly
called
for
by
the
language
and
the
objectives
of
the
robinson-patman
act
and
i
submit
that
it
is
not.
