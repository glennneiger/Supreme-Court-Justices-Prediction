justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
mean
if
you
prevail
the
case
goes
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
to
review
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
wasn't
--
wasn't
there
evidence
at
least
there
--
the
claimants
make
in
the
briefs
as
i
read
them
before
the
argument
that
--
that
are
some
truths
in
some
of
these
comments
because
of
the
scrupulous
care
which
the
borden
company
uses
in
the
marketing
of
its
branded
product
and
that
unless
that
care
is
used
milk
can
get
tin
can
taste,
it
can
curdle,
it
can
turn
sour,
and
so
on.
and
that
borden
doesn't
presume
to
exercise
any
such
marketing
control
over
it's
--
over
the
brand
name
product
--
i
mean,
over
the
trade
name
for
the
consumer's
name
product,
but
only
over
its
own
part
borden?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
--
and
there's
to
it,
what
is
the
state
of
the
record?
what
does
the
record
show
precisely
as
to
the
availability
of
private
label
milk,
borden
private
label
milk
to
all
kinds?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
whatever
the
quantity
that
was
asked
for?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
finding
of
the
examiner.
