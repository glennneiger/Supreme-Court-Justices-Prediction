justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
that
ordinary
customers
are
forbidden
so
it
would
make
a
big
difference,
wouldn't
it?
one
of
the
small
ones,
they
don't
have
$200,000
business
a
year,
it
is
not
liable
to
have
a
private
brand
--
brand,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
record
show
whether
or
not
any
wholesalers
who
sell
to
small
grocers
have
private
labels
of
their
own
as
wholesalers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
do
you
say
about
the
legislative
history
that
the
government
points
out,
statements
by
mr.
patman
and
others?
justice
hugo
l.
black
decided
the
same
price
when
you
call
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
he
was
the
most
active
man
in
connection
with
this
legislation,
wasn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
his
name
in
connection
with
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
next
doesn't
look
to
me
like
he
brushed
it
off?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
he's
trying
to
do
is
protect
these
independents
from
having
to
say
more
and
they
had
asked
him
about
in
connection
with
the
different
brands,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
said
so
long
as
it
is
the
same
quality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
would
suppose
it
meant
that
if
you
find
commodity,
presenting
a
commodity,
you
had
to
sell
that
commodity
at
the
same
price
to
one
that
you
did
to
others,
if
it
is
of
same
quality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
wasn't
in
the
congress
(laughter)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
--
but
that
is
really
what
it's
based
on
it,
isn't
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
claim
that
if
your
brand
would
bring
a
higher
price,
then
you
don't
have
to
keep
that
price
under
the
label
with
the
others
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
commercially
speaking?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
you
do
that
by
saying
that
comes
in
to
the
quality,
definition
of
the
quality
would
come
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
grade
and
quality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
does
it
not
--
does
it
not
remain
the
same
grade
and
quality
and
milk
is
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
say
grade
and
quality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
agree
if
i
see
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
ultimately
you
--
you're
talking
to
say
that
it's
the
same
grade
and
quality
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
must
sell
it
at
the
same
price,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
is
the
same
--
it's
the
same
identical
milk,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
compares.
