justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
really
so
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
really
that
it
may
not
go
to
the
difference
in
the
quality
of
the
milk
but
it's
first
putting
it
in
the
can.
i
mean,
i
bought
the
same
milk
and
if
you
put
in
the
can
of
borden,
and
it
costs
more
from
there
on
but
doesn't
that
evidence
why
would
you
make
a
forth
comment
this
evidence
really
should
be
directed
to
the
cost
justification?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
should
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
would
you
--
would
you
be
here
--
would
the
government's
bill
be
here
if
it
could
be
clearly
shown
that
borden
made
an
offer
to
put
out
private
brand
for
any
customer
that
wanted
it
just
for
the
--
just
that
its
request.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
they
would
still
sell
their
borden
brand
at
the
higher
price,
but
sell
the
private
labels
at
the
same
price
to
anybody
that
wanted
them
if
there
was
a
real
modified
they
offered
everybody
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
entry
of
the
secondary
level
–
on
the
primary
level
would
be
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it
submitted
that
any
retailer
could
have
bought
either
the
private
or
the
borden
brand
at
will.
you
would
still
say
that
you
wouldn't
dismiss
this
case?
the
commission
wouldn't
even
have
brought
it
if
it
were
clear.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
sustain
your
competition
argument
is
that
--
of
course
that
hasn't
been
determined
in
the
court
of
appeals,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
make
the
argument
that
the
injury
of
primary
line
sustains
the
injury
to
competition.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
feel
the
relative,
the
relationship
between
quantity
wise
between
the
private
label
business
and
the
borden
label
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
could
you
just
tell
me
your
--
if
you
know
or
if
the
record
shows
that
what
percentage
of
their
milk
business
is
private
labeled.
is
it
over
half
or
40%
or
60%?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
those
--
what
percentage
of
borden
sales
of
evaporated
milk
is
private
label
as
compared
with
--
how
does
their
total
evaporated
milk
business
(voice
overlap)
borden
and
their
private
label?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
if
that's
true,
what
is
the
consequence?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
how
about
the
primary?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
the
commission
apply
in
both
primary
and
secondary
of
the
line
of
injury?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
need
to
repeat
it
if
it's
in
the
record
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
court
of
appeals
say
–
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
go
over
the
years
of
--
i
would
think
that
if
you
get
under
the
court
of
appeals
[inaudible]
time
over
the
years
you
sold
--
you
have
these
two
price
--
this
price
differential
all
of
countrywide.
i
don't
know
what
else
would
prove
a
commercial
acceptance
of
the
price
differential.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
all
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
that
there
was
a
difference
and
then
for
a
long
time
and
customer
referred,
they
want
to
put
up
with
it.
