justice
abe
fortas
mr.
hummel
you'd
have
to
learn
of
a
lot
of
things,
wouldn't
you
before
you
made
that
decision
on
that
point
because
the
charge
the
--
the
law
of
violation
here
is
discrimination
in
prices,
isn't
it?
that's
what
they're
charging.
justice
abe
fortas
that
--
that
is
the
violation
of
law
and
then
in
order
to
establish
a
discrimination
in
the
price,
it
has
to
appear
that
the
goods
in
question
are
of
like
grade
and
quality,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
that
if
borden
has
made
private
label
milk
available
for
sale
generally,
the
--
your
question
would
--
the
illegal
question,
the
fundamental
legal
question
would
still
be
are
they
discriminating
between
competing
purchasers
and
to
[inaudible]
you
would
have
to
know
a
lot
of
things
and
it
would
take
us
a
couple
of
months
to
know
and
to
even
to
discuss
here,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
order
itself
in
the
customary
federal
trade
commission
manner
is
not
to
say
that,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
mr.
hummel
but
see
this
--
so
you're
explaining
this
and
would
still
take
the
position
however
that
the
private
label
milk
and
the
borden
label
milk
are
of
like
grade
and
quality.
but
the
point
is
that
you
would
not
take
the
position
for
that
there
was
a
direct
--
it
was
an
injury
of
competition
if
the
private
label
milk
were
offered
to
everybody
at
the
same
price
even
though
that
price
might
be
different
from
the
price
of
the
borden
label,
is
that
correct
as
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
--
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
wood,
does
the
record
show
how
many
private
labeled
customers
borden
has?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
take
your
time
to
find
it
and
i'd
like
to
know
when
it
can
be.
justice
abe
fortas
are
these
warehousing
and
shipping
procedures
applicable
only
to
borden
brand
milk?
justice
abe
fortas
on
private
label
milk
does
the
record
show
whether
that
is
canned
only
upon
receipt
of
a
particular
order
and
immediately
shipped
out?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
where
it
is
sold,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
does
safe
point
buy
private
label
milk
from
you?
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
sell
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
sell
in
accordance?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
does
the
record
show
whether
your
lab
and
go
into
--
the
safeway
allows
you
to
go
in
there
or
turn
the
milk
cans
over
in
their
stores?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
do
you
ship
this
milk
to
the
private
label
safeway
for
private
label
milk
to
safeway
warehouses
that
you
make
store
deliver?
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
refer
to
your
cost
justification
case
was
that
i
was
saving
to
you
because
you
warehouse
--
incur
warehouse
expenses
on
your
borden
label
and
don't
incur
them
on
private
label,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
i
understand
if
i
may
refer
to
a
lot
of
manner
that
you
were
discussing
a
few
moments
ago
looking
at
some
of
these
exhibits.
i
get
the
impression
that
before
a
broker
or
a
salesman
fully
accept
the
private
label
order
that
the
offer
had
to
be
sent
from
the
home
office?
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
true
in
the
case
of
borden
label
milk
as
distinguished
from
private
label?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
private
label
milk?
justice
abe
fortas
private
label
milk?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
ask
you
about
both?
i
understand
from
some
of
these
exhibits
for
example,
number
30
(b)
on
page
743,
i
get
the
impression
rather
that
before
anybody
was
allowed
to
take
an
order
for
private
label,
the
reference
had
to
be
made
in
the
home
office.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
that
was
not
true
and
i
understand
you
to
say
that
that
was
not
true
with
respect
to
borden
label
milk.
in
other
words
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
then
i
notice
on
the
facing
page
there
on
page
742,
an
indication
that
that
particular
case
inquiry
was
made
presumably
to
home
office
and
the
communication
to
the
salesman
said
that
our
policy
has
not
changed
with
respect
to
private
label.
we
have
not
solicited
not
as
telly
says,
we
have
not
solicited
any
business
and
do
not
intend
doing
so.
we
now
have
however
left
it
of
what
has
been
offered
and
have
accepted
somewhat
a
permanent
basis
where
it
fitted
into
our
production
situation
and
long
term
plans.
now
is
that
--
is
that
reflect
that
special
made
policy
or
is
that
an
isolated
situation,
if
you
understand
the
record?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
would
be
some
other
exhibits
from
where
in
which
there
is
a
reference
to
the
approval
of
private
label
orders
where
the
customer
has
been
handling
large
amounts
of
competitor
or
brands
that
remember
carnation
and
pet
milk
being
referred
to.
justice
abe
fortas
and
does
the
record
show
that
that
was
a
type
of
consideration
that
was
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
to
accept
or
reject
the
private
label
offer?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
name
of
that?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
mean
the
company.
justice
abe
fortas
was
there
a
chain
of
retail
stores
wholesale
sponsor
by
thomas
&
howard?
in
other
words,
isn't
that
kind
of
a
fraud
of
wholesale
[inaudible]
justice
abe
fortas
it
what
â€“
affiliated
retail
stores,
isn't
it,
or
my
recollection
is
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
record
show
what's
the
smallest
private
label
order
that
borden
accepted?
justice
abe
fortas
someone
had
said
that.
justice
abe
fortas
someone
had
said
that.
someone
who
say
opposite,
don't
you
think?
not
the
meaning
of
grade?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
wood.
one
of
the
things
about
this
maybe
about
the
argument
that
the
court
of
appeals,perhaps
part
of
what
you've
said
is
that
if
we
should
adopt
that
definition
of
grade
and
quality
and
if
by
the
same
ordinance
made
a
private
label
only
for
the
great
atlantic
and
pacific
tea
company
and
safeway
and
kroger
let's
say
and
didn't
make
it
available
to
anybody
else.
if
we
adopted
the
idea
of
that
commercial
differentiation
in
market
acceptability
just
by
as
a
lower
price
for
the
private
label
product,
there
would
be
no
way
of
reaching
that
situation.
am
i
correct
in
that
observation?
justice
abe
fortas
i
wish
you
would
help
me
and
explain
it
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
suggest
stayed
exactly
the
same
if
the
sale
of
the
private
label
product
would
be
finally
in
the
safeway
and
kroger?
