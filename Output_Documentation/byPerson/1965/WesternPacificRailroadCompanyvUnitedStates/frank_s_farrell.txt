mr.
frank
s.
farrell
may
it
please
the
court,
i
represent
the
railroad
appellees
in
this
case.
in
response
to
justice
harlan's
question,
i'd
like
to
point
out
the
record
of
this
case
during
the
oral
argument
before
the
commission,
counsel
for
appellants
was
asked
if
there
were
through
routes
in
existence
in
this
case
and
he
said
i
quote,
"i
don't
think
there
are
any
through
routes
in
existence
today"
and
that's
found
in
the
record
at
509.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
i
think
that
is
correct,
justice.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
that
is
these
carriers
have
join
to
get
a
name
at
the
santa
fe,
western
pacifica
and
great
northern,
and
holding
themselves
within
the
thompson
case
to
publish
single
factor
through
routes.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
in
these
particular
circumstances,
that
would
be
correct.
here
is
there
is
no
finding
by
the
commission
and
no
evidence
submitted
as
to
whether
or
not
the
great
northern
was
in
fact
a
connecting
line.
the
great
northern
in
its
pleading
before
the
commission
said
we
have
no
objection,
it
did
not
participate,
it
did
not
offer
any
evidence.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
well
there
is
no
finding
on
that;
it
does
serve
portland
justice
brennan.
it
does
serve
portland
serve
industries
at
portland.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
we
are
not,
justice
white.
we
think
that's
irrelevant
out
of
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
that
is
his
answer,
as
i
understand
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
now,
there
is
today
vigorous
competition
between
points
in
california
and
points
in
the
pacific
northwest,
contrary
to
what
counsel
for
the
department
of
justice
stated,
a
shipper
at
los
angeles
has
a
choice
of
routes,
it
has
choice
of
rates.
it
can
route
a
shipment
southern
pacific
on
north
to
portland
and
fence
connecting
lines
beyond.
it
can
route
at
santa
fe
and
fence
southern
pacific
or
santa
fe,
western
pacific.
it
can
also
route
at
union
pacific,
it
has
a
through
route.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
if
it's
western
pacific
in
conjunction
with
the
great
northern,
the
rate
would
be
the
same.
in
other
words,
when
the
commission
in
1931
authorized
the
extension
of
the
great
northern
railroad
south
to
bieber,
in
the
extension
of
the
western
pacific
north
to
bieber
pursuant
to
section
1
of
the
act,
those
routes
represent
that
they
would
join
together
and
publish
single
factor
joint
to
rates
between
these
points
and
they
have
since
that
day.
and
they
seek
traffic
to
move
over
that
route
in
competition
with
the
traffic
moving
over
the
other
routes.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
black,
unless
he
sought
the
route
that
shipment.
the
only
exception
for
that
question
would
be
if
he
sought
to
route
that
shipment
by
santa
fe,
western
pacific,
great
northern
and
fence
union
pacific
or
northern
pacific
the
odd.
then
a
combination
rate
with
one
and
that
would
be
part
of
it,
but
if
he
routed
it
via
the
western
pacific
and
great
northern
be
on,
it
would
be
the
same
other
words
he
has
the
choice
of
going
either
way.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
no,
he
could
still
ship
by
the
western
pacific.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
there
is
a
through
--
there
is
a
single
factor
joint
through
rate
that
shipment
could
move
santa
fe
to
stop
and
fence
western
pacific
to
bieber
and
great
northern
to
portland.
if
that
rate
would
be
the
same,
pacific
move
santa
fe,
southern
pacific
to
portland
or
south
the
pacific
all
the
way
to
portland.
now
if
he
goes
on
up,
if
he
goes
on
up
by
the
bieber
route
in
conjunction
with
the
great
northern
i
would
be
the
same.
but
if
he
sought
the
bieber
route
in
conjunction
with
the
union
pacific
or
the
northern
pacific
north
of
portland,
they
publish
a
single
factor
and
it's
a
local
rate
and
that
rate
would
then
be
higher.
but
if
he
was
going
to
seattle
for
example,
he
could
go
there
either
with
the
great
northern,
they
serve
seattle
in
which
case
he
could
move
via
the
so-called
bieber
route
on
the
same
phase
that
he
could
go
to
southern
pacific
in
portland.
there
is
a
multiplicity
of
routes
available
today.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
it
cost
more
because
if
a
shipper
seeking
to
used
the
western
pacific
and
the
great
northern
to
portland
--
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
--
seeks
to
go
to
just
a
point
served
--
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
alright,
he
can
go
to
seattle
by
the
great
northern
he
gets
the
same
rate,
but
if
he
sought
to
go
bieber
route
in
northern
pacific,
he
would
pay
a
higher
rate
than
he
would
if
he
went
southern
pacific,
northern
pacific.
in
short,
the
union
pacific
and
northern
pacific
he
had
not
joined
with
the
western
pacific
in
a
publication
what
we
call
"single
factor
joint
through
rates".
in
short,
there
is
not
been
a
holding
out
within
the
meeting
of
the
thompson
case,
there
never
has
been.
now,
western
pacific
sought
before
the
commission,
contended
that
there
were
not
reasonable
through
routes
today.
it
introduced
testimony.
the
commission
found
that
there
were
reasonable
through
routes
that
there,
in
fact,
were
a
multiplicity
of
routes
available
today.
and
that
these
defendants
had
complied
with
their
duty
under
section
1
paragraph
(4)
which
specifically
provides
and
applies
to
routes.
then
on
the
appeal
the
western
pacific
brought
that
contention.
it
does
not
challenge
it,
does
not
challenge
the
finding
that
these
defendants
--
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
well,
the
question
then
would
still
remain.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
well,
even
if
the
great
northern
where
the
complaint,
the
question
would
still
the
raised
whether
or
not
they
were
connecting
but
let's
assume
that
for
the
moment.
they
have
to
establish
a
similarity
of
circumstances
and
conditions
in
order
to
provoke
the
--
invoke
the
provisions
of
section
3
(4).
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
yes,
although
they
could
also
invoke
1
(4),
1
(4)
would
only
--
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
that
is
correct.
but
then
when
we
reach
the
part
and
the
commission
had
found
that
there
are
adequate
through
routes,
the
western
pacific
now
says,
"well,
we
contend
that
the
connecting
line
is
any
route
which
has
physically
available
service
and
we
seek
the
challenge
the
commission's
order
on
that
basis."
in
short,
they
say
that
the
term,
the
statutory
term,
which
is
remained
unchanged
since
1887
for
78
years
should
be
construed
to
me
any
line.
the
department
of
justice
unable
to
embrace
that
contention
submits
that
well
it
must
be
part
of
a
route
and
secondly,
the
participants
in
that
route
must
be
willing
to
voluntarily
cooperate.
when
one
turns
to
see
what
a
route
means,
says
the
department
of
justice
here
uses
in
their
briefs,
one
would
think
that
the
thompson
case,
which
this
court
decided
in
1952,
would
apply.
but
they
say
no.
the
thompson
case
does
not
apply
into
this
purpose,
and
does
sure
led
to
speculate
as
to
what
a
route
is.
they
further
say
that
it
must
be
voluntarily.
in
other
words,
under
their
definition
if
the
great
northern
were
not
willing
to
participate,
then
under
justice
definition
the
western
pacific
is
not
a
connecting
line.
so
monday,
if
they're
willing
great
northern
is
willing
to
participate
they
are
connecting
line,
tuesday
if
they
are
not,
they
are
not
connecting
line.
and
i
say
that's
such
a
delusive
test
that
it
could
not
possibly
be
applied.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
it
could
raise
it
under
1
(4)
of
the
act,
a
request
for
through
routes
containing
the
public
interest
support
such
a
request
but
they
are
positioned.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
no,
the
santa
fe
could
not
raise
the
contention
either
under
section
3
paragraph
(4).
because
it
lacks
a
physical
connection,
it
also
is
not
a
participant
in
through
routes.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
it
still
could
not
raise
it
under
paragraph
(4)
section
3.
it
could
however
raise
it
under
paragraph
(4)
of
section
1
which
is
the
provision
of
the
act
designed
to
establish
reasonable
through
routes.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
the
santa
fe
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
only
the
great
northern,
because
it
has
the
physical
connection
at
portland.
but
the
western
pacific
does
not
or
those
in
santa
fe,
the
santa
fe
your
honor
does
not
run
north
to
stockton.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
that's
los
angeles
to
stockton,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
i
think
the
diagram
is
schematically
correct.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
1
(4)
of
the
act,
yes
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
yes,
in
this
--
to
the
commission.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
they
predicated
under
1
(4)
and
under
3
(4).
they
contended
they
were
not
reasonable
through
routes
that
we
have
breeched
our
duty.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
the
commission
would
have
examined
the
multiplicity
of
routes
and
found
that
to
be
adequate
through
routes
to
serve
the
needs
of
commerce
and
defense
in
this
area
of
country.
and
held
their
to
be
no
need
for
the
establishment
of
any
additional
through
routes,
and
that
day
went
on
to
treat
their
further
contention
with
respect
to
their
status
as
connecting
line
and
the
alleged
discriminatory
treatment.
i
remind
the
court
that
the
test
prescribed
by
the
commission,
namely
a
physical
connection
or
present
participation
in
existing
through
routes
is
the
exact
test
that's
understood
by
anyone
dealing
with
this
act.
this
is
a
basic
provision
here.
the
western
pacific
has
now
changed
its
position
again,
it
contends
now
it's
adopted
the
definition
as
a
three-pronged
definition.
it
says,
one,
the
line
must
be
part
of
a
route.
it's
says,
two,
it
must
be
directly
competitive,
it
says
three,
all
participants
must
be
willing
to
engage
in
the
transportation.
so
its
test
now
is
narrower
test
than
the
department
of
justice
has
advocated.
prior
there
are
two
parts
of
today's
arguments
and
based
on
the
brief
it
was
a
far
broader
test.
the
term
--
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
in
the
vice
of
this,
let
us
assume
that
say
the
northern
pacific
that
serves
seattle
on
the
west
and
the
twin
cities
in
minnesota,
minneapolis-st.
paul,
minnesota
and
in
the
northwestern
which
extends
from
the
twin
cities
to
chicago.
say
those
routes
aside
for
competitive
considerations,
they
have
a
direct
service
route
and
they
are
going
to
reduce
their
rate,
to
me
let
us
say
intermodal
competition,
competitions
in
truck
lines.
and
now
a
carrier
down
here
way
done
the
southwestern
part
of
the
country
says,
"well
goodness
sakes
we're
the
connecting
line,
we
demand
to
be
included
in
that
rate,
and
if
you
don't
we're
going
to
file
a
complaint
against
you."
well,
immediately
the
question
presented
is
whether
or
not
this
rate
is
convinced
over
this
long
circuitous
route.
and
so
these
lines
then
who
ought
to
reduce
their
rate
to
participate
and
serve
the
needs
of
commerce
are
going
to
be
–
are
going
to
have
to
refrain
and
may
restrain
from
doing
it.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
no,
you'd
still
have
to
establish
similarities
in
circumstances
condition,
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
frank
s.
farrell
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
they
would
still
examine
it
but
you'd
have
a
multiplicity
of
litigation.
and
there
would
be
no
concern
as
to
whether
or
not
there
are
--
there
is
a
public
need
for
these
through
routes.
i
would
like
to
take
just
the
remaining
minute
or
two
to
explain
to
you
why
the
northern
pacific
and
union
pacific
for
35
years
have
refused
this.
under
the
existing
rates
the
shipment
would
come
north
on
the
great
northern
to
wishram
shown
here
on
the
map
and
would
then
move
directly
east
to
spokane.
assuming
it's
moving
east
out
the
cascade
mountains,
under
what
is
thought
by
the
appellants
that
shipment
would
come
to
wishram
then
go
west
to
vancouver,
washington,
fence
down
into
portland
which
point
would
be
interchanged
to
the
union
pacific
or
northern
pacific
and
then
on
to
its
destination.
security
back
home
of
in
excess
200
miles
in
through
there,
by
in
transit
our
service
would
be
a
day
slower
in
eastern
washington
than
would
be
the
service
of
the
--
than
would
be
our
existing
service
at
the
present
time.
it
would
be
two
days
slower
than
the
existing
service
of
the
great
northern.
our
routes,
both
of
them
serve
oregon,
246
miles
to
portland
but
their
contention
is
we
should
not
get
this
traffic
until
it
gets
to
portland.
more
than
that,
the
traffic
from
bieber
on
north
would
be
handled
by
a
line
that
competes,
if
these
destinations
in
these
points
both
with
the
union
pacific
and
northern
pacific.
these
way
bills
would
be
available
to
them
and
they
could
say,
"well
now
why
should
you
use
union
pacific,
or
why
should
you
use
northern
pacific
service
form
portland?
why
goodness
sakes,
you
routed
via
us
we'll
need
two
days
faster.
we
don't
have
to
go
this
roundabout
route
down
at
the
portland
we
go
directly
down
to
wishram
and
then
south
so
our
service
is
far
better."
and
so
not
only
would
we
lose
traffic
moving
north
and
south
but
shippers
will
say,
"well
if
that's
typical
of
the
service
being
offered
by
northern
pacific
or
union
pacific
may
be
we
ought
to
get
somebody
else
to
handle
our
traffic
to
other
points.
and
we
ask
you
then,
we
say
the
--
when
the
commission
has
full
power
to
establish
whatever
reasonable
routes
are
required
and
when
they
have
specifically
found
that
additional
routes
are
not
required
here
which
remains
unchallenged,
we
ask
the
court
not
to
take
the
term
"connecting
line"
and
read
the
adjective
connecting
out
of
it
and
to
make
it
so
inclusive
that
will
embrace
any
road
of
the
country
to
provide
them
with
relief
when
full
relief
could
be
accorded
assuming
there
was
any
public
need
for
it.
and
we
think
the
statutory
history
and
we
think
the
cases
fully
support
the
established
construction
of
the
act.
thank
you
very
much.
