does
it
make
it
(inaudible)
for
that
purpose.

mr.

chief

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
both
you
and
mr.
ginnane
to
say
that
this
is
the
first
time
this
principle
has
ever
been
raised
in
--
before
the
commission
or
in
courts
since
1887.
then
i
ask
you
if
there
has
been
any
practice
of
doing
what
the
western
pacific
that
contends
throughout
the
country
irrespective
of
litigation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
counsel's
argument
that
since
1887
this
principle
has
never
been
raised
before
the
commission
or
in
court
and
that
there
is
no
practice
between
railroads
of
having
through
rates
such
as
you
insist
upon
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
would
you
just
say
it's
common
practice
in
the
railroad
industry
to
and
has
been
through
the
years
to
do
what
you
are
urging
here
to
be
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
have
no
knowledge
on
what
would
be
done.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
could
furnish
us
with
short
memorandum
as
to
how
in
practice
this
principle
that
you
urge
here
has
been
used
throughout
the
railroad
industry
in
the
country.
did
i
make
myself
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
mean
this.
as
i
understood
you
mr.
ginnane,
this
is
the
first
time
that
this
issue
has
ever
been
raised
before
the
commission
or
in
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
i'm
relating
it
to
this
situation
here
and
what
i
like
to
know
is
just
how
that
has
been
handled
in
practice
in
as
much
as
there
is
no
law
on
the
subject,
no
cases,
no
issues
brought
before
the
courts
on
this
precise
issue.
if
that's
practical,
do
it
with
his
employ,
no
need
worry
about
it.
we'll
adjourn.
