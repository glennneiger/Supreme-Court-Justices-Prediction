justice
abe
fortas
mr.
bender,
i
wonder
if
you
could
help
me.
what
are
the
practical
implications
of
your
position?
how
much
of
a
problem
would
that
raise
throughout
the
rest
of
the
country?
in
other
words,
can
you
describe
in
any
way
you
give
us
some
approximation
of
the
extent
to
which
problems
occur
throughout
the
country
that
would
be
affected
by
the
definition
of
connecting
lines
that
you
have
stated.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
proceedings
instituted,
i'm
taking
about
the
extent
to
which
this
would
suggest
that
proceedings
to
be
brought.
for
example,
the
both
pennsylvania
and
the
new
york
central
have
transcontinental
through
rates
that
are
satisfactory
to
them
or
would
affect
their
problem,
put
it
in
another
way
would
this
affect
the
situation
of
every
railroad
in
the
united
states
which
has
a
competing
road
in
that
particular
area,
one
of
the
two
roads
having
through
rates
with
some
other
road
or
system.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
how
extents
in
this
situation
can
you
estimate?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
on
conventional
basis
of
the
icc's
basis,
if
the
great
northern
applied
for
a
through
route,
through
rates
that
would
just
extend
through
the
great
northern's
land,
wouldn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
tell
me
whether
the
--
to
your
understanding
that
the
icc
agrees
with
â€“-
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
ginnane,
i
hope
i'm
not
interrupting
your
line
of
argument.
justice
abe
fortas
then
if
i
understand
you,
you
would
say
that
this
court's
definition
in
thompson
as
you
referred
to
it.
we
need
to
--
an
answer
different
than
that
given
to
me
by
counsel
who
spoke
just
before
you
did
in
this
situation.
let's
suppose
that
great
northern
had
been
the
applicant
here.
and
that
great
northern
asked
for
through
rates
from
all
the
way
down
south
here
and
not
merely
to
the
end
of
the
great
northern
line.
now,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
that
would
not
--
that
the
icc
would
not
construe
connecting
line
to
include
that
kind
of
a
situation?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
and
would
not
be
limited
to
the
great
northern
line
that
would
go
through
the
whole
bieber
route
for
example.
justice
abe
fortas
right
and
you
agree
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then
i
don't
--
i'm
sorry
but
i
do
not
get
the
logic
of
your
position
because
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
now
said
in
the
gaits
of
this
case
in
the
statutory
construction
here
turn
upon
who's
the
applicant.
justice
abe
fortas
sir?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
connecting
line
when
the
statute
uses
connecting
line,
the
icc's
position
is
that
that
term
has
meaning
and
importance
here
for
purposes
of
determining
standing
and
not
for
purposes
of
determining
the
result,
am
i
right
or
wrong?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
ginnane,
could
i
ask
you
whether
the
bieber
route
constitutes,
in
your
opinion,
a
through
route
as
that
word
is
used
in
atlantic
coastline
case.
is
it
a
through
route?
or
does
that
phrase
have
some
historic
meaning
that
i
don't
understand?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
you're
telling
is
that
that
is
a
through
route
there
is
a
through
route
let's
say
from
los
angeles
to
portland
or
whatever
via
those
three
carriers.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
don't
either,
and
that
is
the
phrase
that
is
used
in
atlantic
coastlines,
as
i
said,
on
page
293,
and
then
atlantic
coastline,
as
justice
brandeis
said
the
term
"connecting
lines"
is
commonly
used
as
referring
to
all
the
lines
making
up
a
through
route.
justice
abe
fortas
the
mere
fact
that
we
find
that
a
line
is
a
connecting
line
does
not
mean
that
it's
entirely
to
relieve
from
the
freight
line.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
in
not
--
that
is
not
so,
that
is
to
say
that
the
icc
still
can
make
a
rational
and
sensible
judgment
based
on
the
standards
in
the
act.
