mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
sharing
the
argument
for
the
appellees
with
mr.
farrell
who
is
counsel
for
northern
pacific,
union
pacific
and
southern
pacific.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
a
note
which
the
appellants
have
left
with
the
court
of
monopoly
or
near
monopoly
north
of
california
railroad
transportation.
i
think
they
should
have
pointed
out
that
western
pacific
and
great
northern
provide
through
transportation
service
on
rates
the
same
level
as
via
portland
and
southern
pacific
to
such
major
traffics
under
as
to
northwest
served
by
great
northern
as
portland,
seattle,
tacoma
and
spokane.
it's
far
from
a
transportation
monopoly.
of
course,
there
are
local
rail
transportation
monopolies
particularly
communities
served
by
only
one
railroad
line
as
there
are
all
over
the
united
states.
now,
also
in
terms
of
monopoly
this
theory
of
connecting
line
is
now
advanced
for
the
first
time
since
1887,
at
a
time,
when
the
railroad
transportation
monopoly
has
largely
disappeared.
this
contention
might
have
been
more
plausible,
1910
and
1920
when
the
rail
monopoly
was
a
real
thing.
turning
to
this
case,
the
one
question
remaining
since
western
pacific
has
abandoned
its
claim
that
the
public
interest
requires
the
establishment
of
the
routes
which
it's
on.
the
one
question
is
whether
the
commission
and
the
unanimous
three-judge
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
the
proceeding
before
the
commission.
before
the
commission,
in
their
complaint
they
asked
that
they
raised
two
issues.
they
asked
the
commission
to
find
on
the
section
15
(3)
of
the
act,
that
the
public
interest
required
the
establishment
of
the
through
routes
and
the
joint
rates
of
which
they
desire.
the
second
prong
and
after
a
hearing
of
a
presentation
of
evidence,
the
commission
found
that
they
had
not
satisfied
the
burden
of
showing
that
public
interest.
the
second
prong
of
their
case
presented
their
complaint
before
the
commission,
was
that
they
were
entitled
to
rates
on
the
same
basis
as
the
appellees
had
with
southern
pacific
via
portland
because
they
were
a
connecting
line,
so
they
urged,
with
the
railroad
appellees
at
portland.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
bieber
is
a
through
route
like
participated
in
by
santa
fe,
western
pacific
and
great
northern
up
to
portland
and
two
points
served
by
great
northern.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
like
most
through
routes
in
this
country,
it's
by
voluntary
arrangements
between
the
carriers.
the
huge
majority
of
through
routes
and
joint
rates
have
been
worked
out
by
collaborating
carrier
themselves.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
correct,
sir.
only
the
3
(4)
issues
were
litigated
in
the
district
court.
there
were
two
of
those
issues
presented
on
the
district
court.
first,
the
commission's
holding
that
western
pacific
was
not
a
connecting
line.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
a
connecting
line,
and
secondly
that
even
if
it
was
connecting
line
there
was
not
assuring
a
sufficient
similarity
of
transportation
conditions
to
warrant
rate
equality.
the
three-judge
court
unanimously
sustained
the
commission's
finding
that
western
pacific
was
not
a
connecting
line
and
thereby,
therefore,
found
it
unnecessary
to
get
into
the
second
question.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
not
being
litigated
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
indeed,
because
their
3
(4)
argument
is
an
entirely
separate
prong
and
an
entirely
separate
ground
for
the
relief
which
they
sought.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
under
15
(3)
and
1
(4)?
in
effect
the
commission
held
to
that
the
adequacy
of
existing
routes,
through
routes,
coupled
with
problems
of
security
over
some
of
the
routes
sought
by
western
pacific
by
northern
pacific
and
union
pacific,
added
up
to
an
insufficient
showing
of
public
interest.
the
commission
and
the
court
below
held
that
western
pacific
is
not
a
connecting
line
at
portland
because
a
connecting
line
within
a
meaning
of
section
3
(4)
is
one
which
has
either
a
direct
physical
connection
at
the
common
interchange
point
or
as
one
which
makes
up
a
through
route
through
the
interchange
point.
admittedly,
western
pacific
whose
northern
terminus
at
bieber
is
490
miles,
railroad
miles
from
portland,
does
not
physically,
does
not
have
a
physical
connection
with
northern
pacific
and
union
pacific
in
portland.
commission
further
held
that
no
effective
through
routes
exist
between
points
in
california
served
by
western
pacific
on
its
connections
and
points
the
northwest
on
then
lines
of
up
and
northern
pacific
through
bieber
and
portland.
and
in
finding
that
no
such
through
routes
existed,
the
commission
applied
this
court's
definition
of
through
route
laid
down
in
thompson
v.
united
states.
that
definition
is
that
a
through
route,
said
this
court,
is
an
arrangement
express
or
implied
between
connecting
railroad
for
the
continuous
carriage
of
goods
from
the
originating
point
on
the
line
of
one
carrier
to
the
destination
on
the
line
of
another.
and
it's
admitted
in
this
case
that
western
pacific
under
the
thompson
definition
does
not
make
up
a
through
route
with
northern
pacific
and
union
pacific
via
bieber
in
portland.
its
definition
is,
its
contention
is
that
it
is
an
intermediate
segment
of
a
route,
the
so-called
bieber
route,
involving
santa
fe,
western
pacific
and
great
northern
from
points
in
california
to
portland
and
that
the
route
is
a
connecting
line
within
a
meaning
of
section
3
(4).
the
heart
of
their
position
is
stated
at
page
19
of
their
brief,
and
they
say
there,
and
i
quote.
"by
connecing
line,
congress
apparently
intended
to
describe
a
continuous
series
of
lines
where
the
traffic
on
one
could
physically
moved
onto
the
tracks
of
the
others."
this
is
the
first
time,
this
contention,
this
definition
of
connecting
line
has
been
urged
since
1887.
and
indeed,
it
took
western
pacific
30
years
since
the
construction
of
the
bieber
route
to
discover
that
all
this
time,
it
had
been
the
victim
of
connecting
line
discrimination.
a
few
other
undisputed
facts,
western
pacific
is
a
wholly
separate
railroad
corporation
from
great
northern
and
from
santa
fe.
it's
separately
managed
and
separately
prosperous,
we're
not
dealing
with
financially
cripple
line
here.
all
of
this
people
are
making
money.
western
pacific
maintains
through
routes
to
santa
fe
and
great
northern,
on
track
at
moving
between
points
in
california
and
portland
and
beyond
portland
to
points
served
by
great
northern,
such
points
as
seattle,
spokane,
tacoma.
looking
at
the
language
of
section
3
(4),
it
prohibits
a
railroad
from
practicing
rate
discrimination
between
connecting
lines
and
it
does
have
a
definition
of
connecting
line.
it
says
as
huge
in
this
paragraph
the
term
connecting
line,
means
the
connecting
line
of
any
carrier
subject
to
provision
of
this
part
or
any
common
carrier
by
water.
it
is
the
connecting
line
of
a
carrier,
which
is
used
in
the
singular
not
a
string
of
carriers
that
can
form
a
potential
route.
it's
the
connecting
line
of
a
carrier,
the
connecting
line
of
a
water
carrier.
now,
we
point
out
in
our
briefs
that
all
through
the
interstate
commerce
act,
congress
has
used
the
word
"route".
the
act
has
been
amended
again
and
again
while
congress
has
used
the
word,
route.
and
the
persistent
used
of
the
word,
"retention",
or
the
concept
of
connecting
line
in
section
3
(4)
we
thing
suggest
that
if
congress
had
wanted
to
protect
a
route
and
the
appellant's
sense
of
the
term,
it
would
have
known
how
to
do
so
at
many
times
since
1887.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
not
at
all
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
let
us
assume
in
this
litigation
that
great
northern
is
a
connecting
line
with
up
and
northern
pacific
at
portland.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
that
therefore,
if
they
filed
for
relief
under
section
3
(4)
and
could
show
similarity
of
circumstances
that
they
would
be
entitled
to
equality
of
rate
treatment.
now,
i
understood
mr.
bender
to
state
that
that
of
rate
treatment
to
which
great
northern
would
be
entitled
as
a
connecting
line,
would
not
be
limited
to
traffic
moving
to
local
points.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
certainly
in
beyond
the
great
northern
lines
because
it
would
be
entitled
to
equal
rate
treatment
not
merely
on
local
traffic
but
on
through
traffic
which
would
mean
it
would
have
to
be
able
to
carry
it
through,
deliver
it
to
western
pacific
at
beiber
so
that
it
brought
down
either
stockton
for
interchange
or
all
the
way
down.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
would
agree.
a
connecting
line
is
entitled
to
rate
equality
not
merely
on
traffic
local
to
its
lines
but
on
through
traffic
passing
over
its
lines.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
that's
true
at
many
situations.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
that's
true
of
many
situations
in
the
law.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
that
would
only
someone
whose
rights
have
been
protected
by
congress
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
can
invoke
that
protection.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
that's
--
well
that
would
be
one
way
of
putting
it
but
i
don't
think
that
exhaust
the
implications.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
of
course
section
1
(4)
applies
regardless
whether
you
have
connecting
lines
or
not.
commission
proceeding
to
enforce
1
(4)
under
section
15
(3)
could
order
participation
in
the
through
route
and
then
the
joint
rate
by
six
carriers
as
scattered
all
across
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
would
say
this;
if
every
line
which
makes
up
one
of
a
dozen
carriers
stretched
across
the
country
can
assert
connecting
line
status,
there
isn't
much
left
to
be
done
under
15
(3)
in
establishing
through
routes
and
joint
and
joint
rates
required
by
the
public
interest.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
that
situation,
in
that
situation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
because
it
was
a
connecting
line.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
a
question
of
geography,
really,
geographical
location.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
they're
schematically
accurate.
we
have
no
quarrel.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they're
accurate
enough
that
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
it
in
just
a
minute.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
urge
that
section
3
(4)
and
its
provisional
rate
discrimination
between
connecting
lines
should
not
be
read
in
the
vacuum.
it's
only
one
of
the
several
sections
in
which
congress
has
defined
the
obligations
of
privately-owned
and
privately-managed
railroads
to
engage
in
integrated
transportation
service.
1
(4)
says
that
railroads
shall
establish
a
reasonable
through
routes
and
reasonable
rates
over
those
routes
with
other
carriers.
under
section
15
(3)
the
commission
can
compel
such
action
on
the
part
of
railroads,
and
under
the
statutory
pattern,
we
think
it's
clear
that
railroads
are
not
required
to
enter
into
through
routes
and
joint
rates
with
every
conceivable
combination
of
carriers
and
junctions.
they
must
enter
into
a
reasonable
through
route
and
rate
arrangements
required
to
serve
the
commerce
of
the
country
and
they
may
not
discriminate
against
connecting
lines.
but,
on
its
phase,
3
(4)
is
narrower
than
the
carriers'
obligations
and
the
commission's
responsibilities
under
15
(3)
because
it's
limited
to
lines,
not
to
routes.
there
is
very
little
legislative
history
in
what
congress
intended
by
this
connecting
line
provision.
i
suppose
partly
because
it
appears
for
the
first
time
in
the
conference
committee
report
laid
in
1886.
there
was
only
characterization
of
it
by
senator
spooner,
is
the
only
any
of
us
either
side
of
this
case
has
found.
and
senator
spooner
said
the
principle
embodied
in
it
was
long
ago
imposed
on
a
qualified
way
upon
the
union
pacific
and
northern
pacific
companies.
we
can
only
figure
this
out
as
a
reference
to
the
pacific
railroad
acts
which
has
this
court
as
recognized
required
union
pacific
and
central
pacific
to
be
operated
as
a
single
line,
and
to
avoid
any
form
of
discrimination
against
each
other.
so
and
of
course
those
two
lines
were
intend
to
and
did
physically
connect.
so,
the
only
clue
we
have
as
to
the
urge
in
the
connecting
line
provision,
it's
not
conclusive
but
it's
the
only
thing
we
have
is
an
illusion
to
the
situation
of
two
railroads
union
pacific
and
central
pacific
which
did
in
fact
physically
connect.
now,
under
the
definition
of
connecting
line
proffered
of
by
the
department
of
justice,
new
haven
or
boston
and
maine
is
one
of
your
honors
indicated.
either
one
can
assert
a
reasonably
direct
line
potential
route
via
new
york
central,
burlington
and
rio
grande
or
union
pacific,
the
tie-up
to
be
in
connection
with
the
western
pacific
at
salt
lake
city.
now,
just
as
seattle
shies
away
from
the
implications
of
that,
that
boston
and
maine
can
exert
a
compulsion
to
participate
routes
in
it
from
coast
to
coast,
merely
as
being
an
element
and
a
potential
route
and
still
claim
connecting
lines
fixed,
so
just
to
suggest
as
this
qualification
that
all
the
intervening
participants
must
be
willing
to
participate,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
presents
anomalies
too.
if
such
a
string
of
carriers
is
a
route
which
congress
intended
to
protect
as
a
connecting
line,
illogical
is
it
to
suggest
that
any
participant
along
the
route
can
cut
off
the
connecting
line
rights
of
anybody
behind
it.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
discuss
briefly
this
court's
decision
relied
upon
by
the
appellants
as
dispositive,
the
atlantic
coastline
decision
decided
by
this
court
in
1932.
your
honors
will
recall,
the
commission
held
at
western
pacific
was
not
a
connecting
line
with
the
northern
pacific
and
union
pacific
at
portland,
because
it
didn't
have
a
direct
physical
connection
with
them,
and
secondly,
because
it
did
not
participate
with
northern
pacific
and
union
pacific
in
through
routes
via
and
through
portland
as
defined
by
this
court
in
the
thompson
case.
both
western
pacific
and
the
department
now
contend
that
western
pacific
enjoys
connecting
lines
status
with
northern
pacific
and
union
pacific
at
portland,
because
they
participate,
because
western
pacific
and
great
northern
participate
in
a
through
route
up
to
portland.
they
said
that's
enough
to
make
them
a
connecting
line.
and
they
say
that
this
flows
from
this
court's
decision
in
the
atlantic
coastline
case.
to
begin
with,
the
atlantic
coastline
case
didn't
involve
section
3
(4)
at
all.
it
involved
the
interpretation
and
application
of
conditions
which
the
commission
imposed
in
authorizing
atlantic
coastline
and
louisville,
nashville
to
lease
the
clinchfield
line.
and
they
threw
in
a
condition
the
protected
condition
requiring
that
the
clinchfield
be
kept
open
equally
available
to
such
carriers
now
connecting
or
which
may
hereafter
connect.
and
through
traffic
they
desire
to
participate
in
through
traffic
between
the
ohio
river
and
points
north
and
southeastern
territory.
and
after
approval
of
the
lease,
coastlines
sought
to
cancel
a
lot
of
joint
rates
and
which
paid
piedmont
and
georgia
&
florida,
two
small
carriers
had
been
participating.
and
the
commission
required
them
to
continue
these
rates.
now,
as
this
act
--
had
been
sustaining
this
action
of
the
commission
that
this
court
stated,
the
argument
is
that
the
georgia
&
florida
does
not
connect
since
its
own
rails
do
not
physically
abut
on
the
clinchfield
rails,
the
connection
being
made
over
the
piedmont
and
northern.
there
is
no
warrant
from
limiting,
said
this
court,
the
meeting
of
connecting
lines
to
those
having
a
direct
physical
connection
with
clinchfied.
the
term
is
commonly
used
a
referring
to
all
the
lines
making
up
a
through
route.
the
appellants,
the
department
say,
that
this
language
supports
the
proposition
that
connecting
line
includes
all
carriers
who
are
willing
to
participate
in
through
transportation.
they
need
not
already
have
participated
with
the
defendants
in
this
case
northern
pacific
and
up
and
portland.
their
reliance
on
this
court's
atlantic
coastline
decision
is
wholly
fallacious
for
two
reasons.
as
the
three-judge
court
and
the
atlantic
coastline
case
recognized
the
joint
rates
which
the
commission
ordered
continued
involved
the
participation
of
the
two
complaining
carriers
georgia
&
florida
and
piedmont
in
through
routes
going
way
beyond
the
interchange
points
to
points
up
in
the
ohio
and
north
of
the
ohio
river.
they
were
not
routes
up
to
the
interchange
point.
secondly,
looking
--
treating
atlantic
coastline
as
a
section
3
(4)
four
case,
at
every
stage
in
the
atlantic
coastline
litigation
before
the
commission
and
the
courts,
among
the
complainants
was
piedmont
which
was
the
directing
connect
--
the
direct
physically
connecting
line
in
the
position
of
great
northern
in
this
case.
piedmont
as
a
connecting
line
would
be
entitled
to
nondiscriminatory
rate
treatment
on
through
traffic
as
well
as
local
traffic.
and
as
both
the
united
states
and
the
commission
pointed
out
in
the
atlantic
coastline
case
in
their
joint
brief,
the
fact
that
piedmont
was
a
connection
and
was
entitled
to
nondiscriminatory
treatment
on
through
traffic,
that
that
pretty
much
carried
georgia
&
florida
in
this
case
western
pacific
along
for
free,
that
nothing
in
the
facts
before
this
court
in
atlantic
coastline,
is
inconsistent
with
the
way
the
commission
applied
this
court's
later
definition
of
through
route
from
the
thompson
case.
and
nothing
and
what
this
court
actually
decided,
supports
the
definition
of
a
connecting
line
which
they
now
uniquely
and
in
the
first
time
in
75
years
urge.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
a
through
route
does
not
exist
as
such.
through
routes
exist
between
particular
carriers.
in
other
words,
we
could
not
say
that
there
exist
a
through
route
via
bieber
between
los
angeles
and
portland.
we
would
have
to
say
in
whole
historic
terminology
is
that
there
is
a
through
route
participated
in
by
santa
fe,
western
pacific
and
great
northern
between
the
los
angeles
and
portland.
and
that
through
route
unlike
a
public
road
that
through
route
is
not
available
to
nonparticipating
carriers
such
as
northern
pacific
and
union
pacific.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
there
is
indeed
and
some
active
through
route
as
a
matter
of
fact
western
pacific
is
about
1/3
of
its
tonage
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
in
that
case
the
through
route
broke
over
the
interchange
point,
there
weren't
up
to
the
interchange
point.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
i
ask
some
clarification.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
is
there
a
proper
definition
of
connecting
line?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
only
that
--
i
only
meant
to
say
the
first
time
such
a
concept
of
connecting
line.
