justice
hugo
l.
black
does
your
argument
announce
then
to
the
--
saying
to
the
commission
that
this
particular
railroad
simply
doesn't
have
standing
to
raise
those
questions,
suppose
it
is
not
connected
up
there
but
that
the
other
one
between
the
western
pacific
and
portland
should
come
in
and
ask
for
that
relief
commission
would
have
to
grant
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
almost
effect
in
the
standing
to
raise,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
it
routes
it
by
western
pacific,
is
the
rate
higher
of
lower?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
must
have
misunderstood
you
or
one
of
the
others.
do
i
understand
that
the
shipper
in
los
angeles
wishes
to
ship
through
the
route
that
goes
on
with
portland
and
go
over
the
western
pacific,
that
he
can
now
get
his
cheaper
rate
if
you
would
get
if
he
takes
the
through
rate
on
los
angeles
to
boston?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
has
to
pay
an
extra
way,
if
he
ship
by
the
western
pacific.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
all
the
way
from
los
--
i'm
still
lost
here,
shipment
is
going
to
go
from
los
angeles
to
portland,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
now
that
under
--
although
there
is
no
through
rate
by
the
western
pacific,
that
the
man
can
still
ship
it
as
cheaper
that
way
as
he
can
over
the
one
where
they
have
through
route?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you?
what
would
be
the
situation
if
the
atchison,
topeka
and
santa
fe
which
connects
at
los
angeles
had
filed
this
petition,
would
it
be
in
the
same
--
could
be
in
the
position
to
raise
it?it
connects
at
los
angeles.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
could
raise
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
great
northern
which
connects
at
portland
could
raise
it.
but
your
position
is
as
i
understand
it
that
the
western
pacific
is
the
one
in
the
line
that
couldn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
yet
but
supposed
it
wanted
to
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
see
if
this
other
route
would
be
performed
which
is
the
through
route
they
want,
if
pertaining
that
couldn't
this
map
on
page
5
of
the
government's
brief,
if
it
confides
transportation
by
the
great
northern
or
the
western
pacific
and
by
the
atchison,
topeka
and
santa
fe,
that's
right
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
atchison,
topeka
and
santa
fe,
the
great
northern
are
connecting
railroad
are
connecting
line.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
this
shows
that,
this
map
must
be
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
