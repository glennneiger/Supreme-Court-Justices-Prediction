mr.
chief
justice,
i
move
the
admission
of
paul
bender
of
the
district
of
columbia
bar
for
purposes
of
arguing
this
case
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
mr.
walter
g.
treanor
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
co-counsel
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
i
represent
the
western
pacific
railroad
company
and
its
subsidiary
lines,
the
appellants
in
this
matter.
this
case
arises
under
the
provisions
of
section
3
(4)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
which
in
part
prohibits
the
practice
of
railroad
rate
discrimination
between
connecting
lines.
western
pacific
charges
railroad
appellees
with
such
a
practice
against
them.
the
map
placed
before
the
court
is
an
enlargement
of
the
map
which
railroad
appellees
included
in
their
brief
herein.
we
hope
that
it
may
prove
helpful
in
describing
the
basically
simple
factual
situation.
the
pacific
west
coast
is
served
generally
by
only
two
north,
south
railroad
routes,
which
are
directly
competitive
one
with
the
other.
these
two
routes
are
the
southern
pacific
between
portland
and
los
angeles
which
are
shown
in
brown
and
its
connection
with
the
santa
fe
from
stockton
south
to
los
angeles
on
one
hand
and
the
so-called,
bieber
route
which
is
made
up
of
the
purple
great
northern
from
portland
to
bieber,
the
western
pacific
in
red
from
bieber
to
the
stockton,
san
francisco,
oakland
bay
area
and
atchison,
topeka
and
santa
fe
in
green
south
to
los
angeles.
both
routes
extend
between
southern
california
and
portland,
oregon
and
both
routes
physically
connect
with
railroad
appellees
at
portland.
both
routes
served
the
same
general
territory
in
this
area
and
all
major
shipping
points.
the
bieber
route
was
under
the
specific
authorization
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
completed
in
1931.
as
described,
it
consists
now
as
it
did
then
of
the
end-to-end
connections
of
the
three
specifically
described
railroads.
southern
pacific
route
was
constructed
first
and
for
almost
20
years
was
the
only
north-south
rail
route
in
this
territory.
the
construction
of
the
bieber
route
was
for
the
declared
and
avowed
purpose
of
establishing
for
the
first
time
a
service
fully
competitive
with
the
event
existing
southern
pacific
route.
railroad
appellees
which
served
the
territory
north
to
portland
up
in
oregon,
washington
and
western
idaho
by
establishing
and
maintaining
a
full
line
of
through
service
rates
with
southern
pacific
via
portland
while
at
the
same
time
refusing
to
enter
into
similar
arrangements
with
the
bieber
route
have
forted
and
frustrated
the
competition
between
these
two
routes.
with
the
result
that
on
all
traffic
moving
to
or
from
the
appellee's
territory,
the
southern
pacific
has
a
virtual
monopoly
as
a
practical
manner
than
using
one
of
the
many
illustrations,
which
appear
in
the
record.
if
the
shipper
at
seattle
located
on
the
lines
of
railroad
appellees,
make
the
shipment
from
seattle
destined
to
san
francisco,
california
and
the
discrimination
did
not
exist,
we
would
be
fully
competitive
at
portland
for
the
movement
south
from
the
point
of
common
interchange.
but
because
of
the
rate
discrimination,
the
shipment
must
move
south
of
portland
on
the
southern
pacific
route
even
if
it
is
destined
to
an
industry
served
exclusively
by
the
western
pacific
railroad
in
the
san
francisco
area.
and
the
same
situation
prevails
in
the
opposite
direction.
the
need
for
competitive
service,
which
in
1931
required
establishment
of
the
bieber
route,
is
manifestly
more
pronounced
today.
in
january
of
this
year,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
rejected
the
separate
efforts
of
both
southern
pacific
and
the
santa
fe
to
take
stock
control
of
western
pacific
pointing
to
among
other
factors
the
critical
need
of
western
pacific
to
remain
as
an
independent
effective
competitor
of
southern
pacific
company
with
particular
emphasis
on
its
operations
via
the
bieber
route.
the
division
--
the
decision
of
the
commission
also
pointed
to
the
relative
ineffectiveness
of
the
competition
provided
in
this
territory
by
other
modes
or
forms
of
transportation.
efforts
to
abate
the
discrimination
have
been
unavailing
because
both
the
commission,
contrary
to
the
findings
of
its
hearing
officer,
and
the
lower
court
determined
that
western
pacific
was
not
a
connecting
line
with
appellees,
because
one,
it
is
not
the
partner
in
the
bieber
route
which
enjoys
the
physical
connection
with
appellees
at
portland,
and
in
the
alternative
western
pacific
does
not
now
have
by
grace
of
railroad
appellees
what
they
have
classified
as
a
business
connection
with
them.
both
the
commission
and
lower
court
rely
upon
atlantic
coast
line
versus
united
states.
it
is
our
contention
that
they
have
wholly
misconstrued
that
case
which
is
not
only
contrary
to
what
they
believe
it
holds,
but
in
fact,
supports
the
right
of
a
carrier
located
as
is
western
pacific
here
to
seek
and
obtain
relief
under
the
provisions
of
section
3
(4).
it
does
not
require
any
liberalization
of
the
present
interpretation
of
the
term
connecting
lines
to
so
hold.
not
only
is
this
so
under
the
doctrine
of
atlantic
coastline
but
under
every
other
pronouncement
of
this
court
on
the
subject
and
especially
under
the
decision
in
chicago,
indianapolis
&
louisville
railroad
versus
united
states.
after
the
commission
hearing
examiner
in
this
case
had
heard
all
of
the
evidence
first
hand.
he
cut
through
all
of
the
extraneous
argument
and
held
for
western
pacific
in
what
we
believe
are
simple,
clear
and
positive
findings.
his
summation
at
page
654
of
the
record
herein
was
and
i
quote,
"there
is
no
justification
in
this
record
for
such
treatment
of
a
connecting
line.
the
granting
of
a
full
line
of
rates
to
one
railroad
and
an
interchange
point
while
at
the
same
time
limiting
the
extent
of
such
rates
to
the
favored
lines'
competitor
is
the
essence
of
discrimination.
it
is
the
type
of
unlawful
discrimination
section
3
(4)
of
the
act
aims
to
prevent."
the
appellant's
definition
of
a
connecting
line
comports
with
a
clear
legislative
intent
and
is
fully
consistent
with
this
court's
repeated
their
determination
that
and
i
quote
from
page
594
of
the
chicago,
indianapolis
&
louisville
decision,
"wherever
discrimination
is
in
fact
practiced
an
order
to
remove
it
may
issue
and
the
order
may
extend
to
every
carrier
who
participates
in
inflicting
the
injury."
that
was
the
case
which
arose
under
section
3
(4)
of
the
act.
the
appellees
would
not
question
as
shown
from
the
pleadings
they
have
filed
with
this
court.
western
pacific
standing
here
as
the
connecting
line,
if
appellees
already
joined
us
in
through
rates
on
a
level
somewhat
higher
than
they
maintain
with
southern
pacific.
yet
they
seriously
contend
that
their
flat
refusal
to
join
on
any
level
constitutes
the
complete
defense.
that
cannot
be
the
law
as
congress
intended
it
nor
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
interpreted
it.
section
3
(4)
is
designed
to
assure
the
shipping
public
of
the
opportunity
of
choice
between
comparable,
fully
available
service
and
the
decision
as
to
which
to
use
is
properly
theirs,
the
shipping
publics
and
not
that
of
the
carrier
which
is
practicing
the
discrimination
which
is
prohibited.
as
covered
in
our
briefs,
the
position
we
take
is
fully
supported
by
the
legislative
history,
the
case
history,
and
the
factual
and
the
competitive
situation
here
prevailing.
everyone
on
both
sides
of
this
case
agrees
that
the
two
pivotal
cases
are
atlantic
coastlines
and
chicago,
indianapolis
&
louisville.
we
agree
with
the
united
states
that
chicago,
indianapolis
&
louisville
clearly
require
an
end
to
the
discrimination.
atlantic
coastline,
we
say,
supports
our
concept
of
connecting
lines
status.
just
as
in
the
instant
case
now
before
the
court,
one
of
the
complaining
carriers
there
did
not
have
physical
connection
with
the
line
practicing
the
discrimination.
at
the
first
opportunity,
the
discriminating
carrier
took
positive
steps
to
make
it
clear
that
it
was
not
holding
out
a
through
service
with
that
carrier
and
this
court
held
that
action
to
be
unlawful.
the
court
required
the
clinchfield,
which
in
this
--
in
that
case
was
in
the
position
of
the
appellees
here
to
be
maintained
as
a
neutral
carrier
treating
its
common
connecting
lines
equally
in
the
matter
of
rates.
such
neutrality
would
not
have
been
possible
at
all
if
the
clinchfield
had
been
allowed
the
unilateral
right
to
determine
the
extent
of
its
rate
participation
with
these
connections.
there
was
no
requirement
in
that
case
of
a
pre-existing
rate
arrangement
through
the
point
of
interchange.
the
court
was
clearly
in
interested
in
the
arrangements
which
existed
to
the
point
of
common
interchange.
however,
even
had
the
court
than
talking
of
an
arrangement
in
the
sense
of
one
through
the
point
of
interchange,
it
was
not
in
some
technical
through
route
sense
that
appellees
used
the
term
here,
for
the
fact
is
that
in
atlantic
coastline,
there
was
no
deliberate
intentional,
voluntary
holding
out
of
service
by
all
participants.
in
fact,
exactly
the
opposite
was
the
case.
the
offending
carriers
there
were
taking
every
possible
affirmative
step
available
to
them
to
prevent
and
disavow
any
such
holding
out.
so
therefore,
properly
construed,
the
key
cases
make
it
clear
that
western
pacific
position
is
sound
and
consistent
with
the
present
status
of
the
law
and
that
if
we
are
determined
to
be
a
connecting
line
for
the
first
time
since
the
bieber
route
was
constructed,
it
will
fulfill
the
purpose
which
the
commission
and
the
public
had
in
mind
what
it
had
the
route
constructed
and
that
is
to
provide
full
competition.
mr.
walter
g.
treanor
mr.
justice
stewart,
our
definition
would
be
this,
if
a
line
has
a
physical
connection,
it
is
obviously
a
connecting
line.
in
the
alternative,
if
it
is
part
of
a
route
which
does
have
a
physical
connection
with
the
discriminating
carrier,
if
that
route
of
which
it
is
a
part
is
directly
competitive
with
the
favored
line
and
if
all
of
the
participants
in
the
route,
south
of
point
of
interchange
are
ready,
willing
and
able
to
perform
the
full
common
carrier
service
in
conjunction
with
the
discriminating
line,
then
i
say,
it
is
a
connecting
line
under
the
statute
and
the
decision.
mr.
walter
g.
treanor
yes
sir.
i
think
they're
other
--
mr.
walter
g.
treanor
yes
sir.
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
also
point
out
that
in
addition,
there
are
even
greater
factors
here.
in
this
particular
case,
such
as
the
fact
that
they
are
immediately
parallel
one
to
the
other
and
the
history
of
the
routes
deals
with
their
purpose.
there
a
fact
is
in
our
situations
here,
which
go
even
beyond
and
make
our
case
even
more
pronounced
than
the
definition
that
i
suggested
to
the
court.
mr.
walter
g.
treanor
excuse
me,
mr.
justice
harlan,
you
mean
at
the
time
that
the
route
is
constructed?
mr.
walter
g.
treanor
the
--
they
were
several
proceedings
which
preceded
our
case
that
which
is
here.
the
--
mr.
walter
g.
treanor
what
had
happened,
your
honor,
was
that
when
we
first
brought
this
compliant
we
alleged
violations
of
section
3
(4)
as
well
as
violation
of
section
1
(4).
before
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
examiner,
we
took
the
position
in
our
brief
to
the
examiner
that
we
would
be
satisfied
with
a
finding
under
section
3
(4).
we
did
not
press
our
section
1
(4)
beyond
that
point.
now,
the
commission,
when
it
got
to
the
decisional
level
here
did
make
a
ruling
against
us
on
section
1
(4)
but
we
had
not
been
pressing
that
all.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
walter
g.
treanor
addressing
myself
mr.
chief
justice
to
the
second
part
of
the
question.
first,
i
like
to
say
that
i
take
a
position
directly
contrary
to
what
they
say
and
say
that
is
to
say
that
it
is
the
standard
practice
in
the
railroad
industry
to
encourage
as
many
outlets
as
possible
for
your
traffic.
and
if
you
connect
with
more
than
one
carrier
that
your
own
interest
and
the
practice
in
the
industry
ever
since
i've
been
associated
with
the
industry
has
been,
that
railroads
do
not
discourage
additional
outlets
to
their
traffic.
and
i
think
that
while
it
is
true
that
there
are
very
few
cases
which
have
hit
this
issue
directly,
i
think
atlantic
coastline
hits
the
issue
directly
and
i
think
that
chicago,
indianapolis
and
louisville
which
involves
section
3
(4),
although
it
involved
that
interchange
facility
section
of
3
(4)
did
deal
with
the
question
of
connecting
lines
status
and
did
hit
head
on
the
two
question
which
we
have
here
whether
you
need
a
physical
connection
and
secondly
whether
you
need
in
lieu
thereof
the
prior
existence
of
through
service.
and
mr.
justice
brandeis,
in
his
opinion,
hit
both
those
issues
squarely
in
chicago,
indianapolis
and
louisville.
but
i
do
agree
that
while
there
have
been
very
few
cases
on
this
subject,
i
think
that
the
explanation
is
not
what
they
have
suggested
to
you
but
really
because
the
industry
itself
simply
does
not
tie
its
hand
in
a
number
of
connection
and
equal
treatment
which
its
connections.
mr.
walter
g.
treanor
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
that
--
mr.
walter
g.
treanor
--
that
this
is
our
position
and
we
think
the
fact
that
there
has
been
no
litigation
on
it
suggest
one
of
two
things.
it
means
either
that
no
one
has
other
than
the
western
pacific
has
been
confronted
with
this
type
of
tactic,
and
secondly
it
suggests
that
other
railroad
are
finding
their
traffic
moving
freely
over
their
connecting
lines.
mr.
walter
g.
treanor
i
respectfully
suggest,
mr.
justice
white,
that
i
believe
the
reason
is
that
the
great
northern
is
presently
and
at
that
time
was
actively
engage
in
a
merger
with
the
northern
pacific.
they
are
presently
litigating
that
matter
before
the
commission
and
they
are
trying
to
form
a
single
company
and
i
think
they
thought
it
would
be
inconsistent
for
the
great
northern
on
the
one
hand
to
be
attempting
to
merge
with
the
northern
pacific,
and
in
the
other
hand
become
a
party
to
this
proceeding.
another
point
i
would
like
to
raise.
mr.
justice
fortas
raised
a
question
about
the
practical
implications
i
think
much
of
--
mr.
walter
g.
treanor
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
walter
g.
treanor
no
sir,
it
is
not,
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all
it
does
not
solve
our
problem
with
the
union
pacific
and
secondly
--
mr.
walter
g.
treanor
but
we
have
a
physical
connection
but
not
at
the
common
gateway,
we
lose
our
standing
to
bring
a
complaint
on
the
discrimination
statute
because
the
connection
is
down
here
and
their
connection
was
a
southern
pacific
is
up
at
portland
and
over
several
other
places.
so
we
don't
have
any
opportunity
to
bring
an
action
under
section
3.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
we
do
not
believe
that
there's
any
possibility
at
all
any
real
possibility
of
extended
litigation
arising
from
this
situation
because,
i
ask
the
union
pacific
man
on
the
record
at
the
oral
hearing
before
the
commission
whether
he
could
give
me
a
single
instance
were
they
treated
their
common
connections
differently
and
he
could
not
come
up
with
a
single
one.
now,
the
union
pacific
as
a
tremendous
system
and
has
interchange
with
many,
many
carriers
at
thousands
of
points,
and
they
could
not
point
to
a
single
incident
where
they
treated
anybody
differently.
we're
the
only
ones
that
they
do
and
it's
only
in
this
situation
here.
i
would
like
to
address
one
point
to
a
question
raise
by
mr.
justice
white
with
regards

section
15
(4)
the
act
set
forth
the
factors
which
must
be
considered
in
setting
up
any
through
routes
under
section
1
(4)
and
it
specifically
says
by
its
very
terms
that
it
has
no
application
in
a
section
3
case.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
reason
that
section
1
(4)
is
not
the
answer
here
is
that
section
3
(4)
is
designed
by
congress
to
meet
an
entirely
different
evil.
section
1
(4)
can
be
prescribed
in
a
relief
invoked
where
you
don't
treat
common
connections
differently.
where
you
treat
common
connections
differently
than
it
is
required
that
you
must
abate
that.now
whether
that
results
in
giving
the
--
mr.
walter
g.
treanor
i
can't
answer
that
i
believe
mr.
justice
white,
the
term
"through
route"
is
not
a
part
of
section
3
(4)
it
does
not
appear
and
therefore
you
do
not
have
to
have
a
through
route
situation
before
they
can
be
audit
to
treat
their
common
connections
equally.
they
can
either
change
their
level
of
rates
with
the
southern
pacific
or
they
can
give
us
the
same
rates
that
they
are
giving
southern
pacific.
this
court
said
and
it
was
in
--
cited
in
our
brief
united
states
versus
pennsylvania.
mr.
walter
g.
treanor
yes
sir,
in
section
1
(4),
if
you
refuse
and
fail
to
hold
yourself
out,
section
1
(4)
can
be
brought
into
play
as
a
remedial
statue.
if
you
have
through
routes
with
one
common
connection
and
you
fail
to
give
them
with
another
connection,
you
can
be
required
on
the
section
(3),
(4)
to
equalize
them.
mr.
walter
g.
treanor
excuse
me
sir.
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that,
what
i
meant
to
say
was
if
you
give
it
as
a
relief
--
mr.
walter
g.
treanor
that
same
argument
was
raised
in
chicago,
indianapolis
and
louisville.
it
was
met
head
on
by
this
court,
and
they
said
that
it
is
--
mr.
walter
g.
treanor
no
sir,
it
is
not
my
position.
my
position
is
that
under
section
3
(4)
really,
they
have
their
options
as
to
how
they
will
correct
the
inequality
and
the
unequal
treatment.
they
are
not
obligated
to
establish
through
routes
with
us
in
order
to
equalize
that.
that's
up
to
them
how
they
handle
that
situation.
i
do
concede
the
result
might
be
same
under
other
sections
of
the
act
under
other
complaints
which
might
be
brought
by
shippers
depending
on
the
tact
that
they
took.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
i
thank
you,
your
honors.
