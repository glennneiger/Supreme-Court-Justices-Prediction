mr.
paul
bender
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
untied
states
although
nominally
an
appellee
in
this
proceeding,
does
not
support
the
decision
of
the
icc
and
the
district
court
holding
at
the
western
pacific
is
not
a
connecting
line
or
part
of
the
connecting
line
and
is
therefore
unable
to
invoke
section
3
(4)
the
act,
to
remedy
the
alleged
discrimination
in
this
case.
united
states
attempted
to
intervene
in
the
proceedings
before
the
commission
to
present
these
views
and
it
did
not
support
the
position
if
the
icc
that
western
pacific
was
not
a
connecting
line
before
the
district
court.
in
our
view,
the
western
pacific
is
either
a
connecting
line
itself
or
part
of
connecting
line
that
is
a
bieber
route,
and
the
correct
disposition
of
this
case
would
be
for
the
court
to
remand
it
to
the
district
court
for
consideration
of
the
allegations
of
discrimination
which
western
pacific
has
made
and
which
the
district
court
did
not
pass
on
because
the
district
court
found
western
pacific
not
to
be
a
connecting
line.
now,
as
i
say,
we
disagree
with
the
definition
of
the
commission
and
the
court
as
to
what
a
connecting
line
is,
and
i'll
try
to
show
in
a
few
minutes,
why
we
disagree
as
a
technical
matter
of
definition.
our
interest
though
in
the
case
is
a
much
more
serious
than
a
question
of
dry
legal
definition.
it's
the
economic
impact
of
the
commission's
decision,
which
we
are
principally
concerned
with.
we're
concerned
both
as
in
our
capacities
as
shipper
that
the
definition
be
adopted
in
very
important
railroad
routes
between
southern
california
and
the
northwest,
and
also
in
our
sovereign
capacity
our
interest
in
maintaining
free
competition
between
existing
railroad
routes
when
that
competition
is
natural.
we
think
the
definition
adopted
does
just
the
opposite.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
it
does
and
i
shall
address
myself
to
that.
let
me,
if
i
may,
talk
to
say
just
a
few
words
about
the
economic
effect
which
we
think
the
definition
leads
to
and
which
we
think
is
improper.
in
this
case,
the
discrimination
of
the
defending
law
of
the
northern
pacific
and
the
union
pacific
up
in
the
northwest.
their
discrimination
in
favor
of
the
southern
pacific
group
essentially
gives
the
southern
pacific
a
monopoly
in
traffic
that
between
all
points
in
california,
which
they
serve,
and
points
on
the
northwest
served
exclusively
by
the
defendants.
that
is
any
of
these
cities
in
here,
which
is
served
only
by
northern
pacific
or
the
union
pacific.
if
you
are
a
shipper
in
los
angeles,
and
you
want
to
ship
to
one
of
these
cities,
you
would
only
ship
on
the
southern
pacific
even
though
your
plant
may
have
equal
access
to
the
western
pacific
and
therefore
to
the
bieber
route
because
on
the
southern
pacific,
you
get
a
joint
rate
which
is
lower
than
a
combination
rate
at
you
pay
on
the
western
pacific.
now,
that's
not
true.
if
the
point
to
which
you're
shipping
lies
on
the
great
northern
as
well
as
on
the
defendant
roads
because
the
great
northern
maintains
joint
rates
both
with
the
southern
pacific
and
with
the
bieber
route
then
therefore
the
rates
on
points
on
cities
lying
on
the
great
northern.
if
you
ship
via
the
great
northern
are
equal
on
either
route.
but,
if
you
see,
if
the
city
to
which
you're
shipping,
or
if
you're
receiving
goods
from
a
producing
area
up
here,
if
that
city
lies
only
on
one
of
the
defendant
lines,
then
the
southern
pacific
has
a
monopoly
because
the
defendants
have
deliberately
favored
the
southern
pacific
by
entering
into
joint
rates
with
it
and
not
with
the
bieber
route
carriers.
we
think
that
this
definition
is
obviously
inconsistent
with
the
general
purpose
of
the
statute.
congress
made
it
quite
clear
that
that
general
purpose
was
to
prohibit
discrimination
and
all
its
forms,
and
this,
it
seems
to
us,
is
a
very
harmful
type
of
discrimination
which
ought
to
be
prohibited.
also,
i'd
like
to
make
this
point
now,
the
definition
which
has
been
adopted
is
adopted
solely
by
reference
to
the
atlantic
coastline's
case
which
the
commission
takes
a
few
sentences
out
of
the
pieces
together
with
other
decisions
and
says
they're
compelled
to
reach
the
decision
that
western
pacific
is
not
a
connecting
line.
the
definition
is
not
made
with
reference
to
the
purposes
of
the
act,
to
the
reasons
run
anti-discrimination
provision.
it's
made
solely
by
reference
to
this
precedence.
we
think
that
the
precedence
have
been
wrongly
used
by
the
commission
and
by
the
court
and
i
think
i
can
show
that.
but
it
seems
to
us
quite
important
that
the
definition
here
respond
to
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
not
be
done
in
this
mechanical
way
for
piecing
together
a
sentence
from
one
case
with
a
sentence
from
another.
one
final
point
is
preliminary
to
defining
the
word.
under
the
commission's
view
of
the
case
in
the
district
court,
it
is
never
suggested
that
there
isn't
a
violation
of
section
3
(4)
in
this
case.
that
is,
section
3
(4)
prohibits
discrimination
between
connecting
lines.
there's
no
question
in
this
case
that
a
connecting
line
is
being
discriminated
against
everyone
can
seem
that
the
northern,
the
great
northern
which
is
this
purple
road
here,
which
concededly
has
a
physical
connection
with
the
defendants
at
portland
is
a
connecting
line,
that's
true
under
the
narrowest
possible
definition
of
the
language
which
would
be
physical
connection.
so,
the
defendants,
if
the
allegations
of
discrimination
true
and
i
think
that
we
have
to
take
to
construe
in
this
proceeding.
the
defendants
are
clearly
violating
section
3
(4)
of
the
act.
the
only
question
in
the
case
as
well
as
the
western
pacific
has
standing
to
raise
the
objection.
there's
no
question
as
to
the
being
in
violation
of
the
act.
actually,
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
bender
only
if
it's
discriminatory.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
another
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
if
it
didn't
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
the
section
only
deals
with
discrimination
in
rates,
fares
and
charges
between
connecting
lines.
if
the
formation
of
the
through
route
had
no
effect
on
the
rates,
fares,
and
charges,
i
take
it;
it
wouldn't
come
within
section
3
(4).
mr.
paul
bender
well,
there's
a
general
provision
of
the
statute
which
gives
us
the
commission
power
to
i
think
it's,
is
it
one?
think
it's
one-fourth,
yes,
but
this
case,
that
that
provision
applies
regardless
of
whether
there's
a
competing
line
which
you
say
being
favored
that
is
a
section
invoked
in
this
case
applies
only
in
discrimination
situations
and
there,
the
commission
doesn't
have,
isn't
given
by
the
statute
the
discretion
to
decide
whether
it's
in
the
public
interest
to
form
the
through
route.
mr.
paul
bender
i
would
think,
in
any
case,
there
would
be
no
violation
of
3
(4)
unless
rates,
fares
or
charges
were
involved.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
--
if
by
through
route
you
mean
that
you
let
traffic
go
through,
yes.
i
think
the
principle
significance
of
forming
a
through
route
is
to
have
a
joint
rate
applicable
over
the
route.
otherwise,
i
don't
see
what
the
significance
of
the
through
route
is.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
think
the
principal
separation
is
that
3
(4)
is
a
discrimination
provision
and
it
applies
automatically
and
the
commission
has
no
function
of
finding
whether
it's
in
the
public
interest
to
establish
the
routes
and
rates.
whereas
this
1
(4)
applies
when
there
is
no
discrimination,
i
mean,
you
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
there
is
that
distinction.
well,
coming
in
to
the
question,
the
definitional
of
question
in
the
case,
that
is,
what
does
connecting
lines
mean
and
it's
the
western
pacific
a
connecting
line
or
is
it
a
part
of
a
connecting
line?
the
term
is
nowhere
explicitly
defined
in
the
statute.
as
a
matter
of
statutory
language
alone
if
you
just
look
at
the
statute,
it
might
mean
just
direct,
physical
connection.
that
is
it
might
mean
only
lines
which
directly
connect
with
the
defendants.
even
if
you
adopted
that
definition,
it
would
still
be
the
problem
of
what
you
meant
by
a
line
which
connected
with
the
defendant,
did
a
line
in
a
railroad
company
or
did
a
line
mean
a
group
of
railroad
companies
which
form
a
unit
of
railroad
transportation.
in
any
case,
this
question
of
whether
physical
connection
is
the
meaning
of
connecting
lines
was
settled
long
ago
in
the
atlantic
coastline's
case.
so
there's
never
any
doubt
about
it.
it
was
settled
in
that
case
that
connecting
lines
that
is
not
refer
merely
to
physical
connection.
the
court
said,
there
is
no
warrant
for
limiting
the
meaning
of
connecting
lines
for
those
having
a
direct
physical
connection
with
the
carriage
or
to
discrimination.
the
term
is
commonly
used
as
referring
to
all
the
lines
making
up
a
through
route.
well,
if
it
goes
beyond
the
physical
connection,
you've
got
to
decide
how
far
beyond
that
it
goes.
what
we
suggest
as
most
consistent
with
the
obvious
purpose
of
the
act
to
remedy
cases
of
discrimination
is
that
it
refers
not
to
connecting
particular
railroad
companies,
that
is
railroad
companies
which
have
a
physical
connection
with
the
defendant.
but
that
it
refers
to
connecting
units
of
railroad
track
connecting
routes,
connecting
functional
units
of
railroad
transportation.
if
you
discriminate
between
those,
it
doesn't
matter
how
many
railroad
companies
you
have
making
up
the
unit
that
connects,
the
route
that
connects.
you
still
in
violation
of
3
(4)
and
any
one
of
those
companies
along
the
route
can
invoke
the
section
against
you.
for
example,
if
this
case
had
been
turned
around
exactly,
suppose
the
defendants
favored
the
bieber
route
and
discriminated
against
the
southern
pacific,
there'd
be
no
question
of
the
southern
pacific
can
complain.
it's
a
single
railroad
company.
there
would
also
be
no
question
of
the
southern
pacific
could
complain
if
the
discrimination
against
it
only
applied
to
its
bottom
track
near
los
angeles.
now,
supposed
that
they
offered
through
rates
up
to
san
francisco.
but
below
san
francisco,
they
wouldn't
because
they
were
trying
to
favor
the
atchison,
topeka
and
santa
fe
which
serves
between
san
francisco
and
los
angeles.
although
they
didn't
mind
having
the
southern
pacific
competition
with
the
western,
they
didn't
want
it
to
be
in
competition
with
the
atchison,
topeka
and
santa
fe.
well,
even
in
that
case,
there's
no
question
that
the
southern
pacific
have
used
section
3
(4),
i
take
it
the
commission
has
no
doubt
about
that.
it
has
a
physical
connection
up
here
and
as
a
single
railroad
company,
it
goes
all
the
way
down.
well,
if
that's
true,
we
can
see
absolutely
no
reason
why
the
results
should
be
any
different
if
southern
pacific
would've
divest
itself
of
the
last
hundred
miles
of
its
road
and
to
a
different
corporate
entity,
a
separate
corporate
entity.
what's
the
difference?
who
owns
the
track
of
the
road?
the
fact
is
that
it's
a
single
railroad
route.
the
whole
of
the
route
is
being
discriminated
against
and
any
part
of
the
route
can
complain.
certainly,
you
can
complain
about
it
if
you
own
the
whole
route
and
we
think
if
a
company
owns
a
part
of
the
route,
it
ought
to
be
able
to
complain.
the
only
question
we
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
every
line
connects
with
every
other
line
ultimately.
but
what
you'd
have
to
show
--
mr.
paul
bender
well
surely,
and
if
the
boston
and
maine
is
being
discriminated
against
in
say
it's
one
of
its
competitors
is
being
favored
in
the
east
and
you
have
through
route
transportation
across
the
united
states
and
the
boston-maine
is
at
the
end
of
one
of
those.
mr.
paul
bender
as
one
of
its
competitors
as
the
end
of
the
other
is
absolutely
no
reason
why
this
section
shouldn't
apply.
it
applies
whenever
all
the
companies
which
form
one
of
these
groups
do
in
fact
form
a
route.
they
join
together
to
offer
transportation.
now,
there
may
be
questions
in
some
cases
whether
in
fact
the
unitary
route
is
--
exists
up
to
the
point
of
connection.
there's
no
such
question
in
this
case
because
the
bieber
route
has
acted
as
a
unit
ever
since
its
formation.
the
record
is
quite
clear
on
the
fact,
that
within
the
bieber
route,
through
routes
exist
and
have
existed
for
a
long
time.
in
other
words,
if
you
want
to
ship
from
los
angeles
to
portland
on
the
bieber
route,
atchison,
topeka
and
santa
fe,
great
western,
great
northern
through
routes
and
joint
rates
are
in
effect
along
the
bieber
route.
it's
only
if
you
want
to
go
beyond
there
that
you
don't
get
a
joint
rate
with
the
defendants,
but
you
do
get
a
joint
rate
up
until
portland.
so
that
mr.
justice
stewart,
there's
no
question
in
this
case
that
this
is
a
unit
and
it
is
a
route
and
ought
to
be
treated
as
one.
now,
we
suggest
in
the
brief
that
the
definition
ought
to
apply
beyond
that.
the
case
is
where
even
though
the
route
doesn't
friendly
exist
the
to
portland,
all
of
the
participants
in
the
route
express
their
willingness,
as
they
have
in
this
case,
to
join
in
the
routes
through
the
point
of
discrimination.
they
do
that,
it
seems
to
us,
that
it
shouldn't
matter
what
happened
before
so
long
as
they
are
now
willing
to
join
the
through
transportation.
mr.
paul
bender
i
know
of
no
problem
which
would
be
created.
there
haven't
been
so
far
as
i
know
a
great
number
of
this
section
3
(4)
proceeding
--
mr.
paul
bender
potentially,
it
would
if
you
had
two
railroads
in
competition
and
some
other
railroads
somewhere
else
in
the
country
was
offering
joint
rates
with
one
of
them
and
not
with
the
other.
this
would
open
the
possibility
of
the
other
bringing
a
proceeding.
now,
under
this
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
can't
--
honestly
i
can't
say,
i
don't
know.
i
would
doubt
very
much
whether
there
would
be
too
many
instances
where
railroads
would
join
and
through
rates
was
one
road
and
refuse
to
do
so
as
a
competing
road.
ordinarily,
there'd
be
absolutely
no
occasion
for
them
to
do
so.
they'd
want
to
get
as
much
traffic
as
they
could
with
no
reason
to
offer
it
on
one
road
and
not
another.
it's
just
in
this
situation.
we
don't
know
why
it's
true
that
the
union
pacific
and
the
northern
pacific's
for
some
reason
have
sought
to
favor
the
southern
pacific
over
the
bieber
route
carriers.
thereby,
it's
of
some
substantial
extent
destroying
the
western
pacific's
ability
to
compete.
another,
mr.
justice
fortas,
another
problem
which
is
some
ways
as
unique
to
this
case
is
that
you
have
the
concededly
connecting
road.
the
road
which
everyone
concedes,
connects,
the
great
northern
not
being
a
plaintiff
in
the
proceeding
if
it
were
there'd
be
no
question.
now,
again
we
don't
know
why
that
is
part
of
the
several
possibilities
suggested
so.great
northern
simply
may
not
care
enough
because
it
shares
with
the
bieber
route,
it's
too
small
in
relation
to
all
the
rest
of
its
operation.
western
pacific
which
has
probably
the
greatest
percentage-wise
financial
state
in
the
bieber
route,
it
may
be
because
great
northern
doesn't
feel
litigation
worth
it's
while
in
the
sense
that
it
doesn't
want
to
destruct
it's
relationships
with
these
other
roads.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
not.
i
think
it
would
extend
all
the
way
to
los
angeles
because
the
great
northern
is
discriminated
against
and
harmed
by
the
failure
of
union
pacific
to
enter
into
joint
rates
over
the
bieber
route
to
los
angeles.
if
you
want
to
ship
from
up
here
to
los
angeles
and
if
the
great
northern
can
only
compel
through
rates
to
bieber,
if
you
go
into
los
angeles,
you'll
still
ship
over
the
southern
pacific.
that
discrimination
then
directly
toward
the
western
pacific
equally
harms
the
great
northern
to
any
traffic
going
beyond
that.
mr.
paul
bender
it
is
yes,
it
is
my
clear
understanding
of
the
icc
agrees
with
that.
in
the
minute
or
two
remaining
to
me,
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
or
two
about
the
issue
of
discrimination
which
as
i
say
we
think
ought
to
be
remanded
to
the
commission
to
the
district
court
because
the
district
court
didn't
consider.
however,
in
the
footnote
at
the
end
of
our
brief,
we
discuss
some
reasons
why
we
believe
the
commission's
approach
to
the
question
is
wrong.
the
commission
seems
to
decide
the
question
of
discrimination
simply
by
looking
at
physical
configuration
of
the
routes
saying
that
if
this
route
is
longer
that
one,
harder
than
that
one,
there
can't
be
any
discrimination.
in
short,
we
think
that's
wrong.
the
question
of
discrimination
ought
to
be
decided
with
regard
to
the
defendant
road,
not
with
regard
to
the
bieber
route
of
the
southern
pacific.
that
is,
they
can
justify
not
joining
in
through
routes
with
the
bieber
route
if
that
hurts
them,
in
some
way,
if
it's
more
expensive
for
example,
that
the
connection
with
the
bieber
route
is
more
expensive
than
the
connection
with
the
southern
pacific
or
if
it
would
harm
their
goodwill
to
do
so
but,
merely
the
fact
that
the
bieber
route
is
a
longer
route,
doesn't
seem
to
us
to
justify
their
refusal
to
join
in
through
rates
but
at
that
choice
whether
the
ship
for
wants
to
go
on
the
longer
route,
the
slower
route,
or
the
shorter
more
direct
one,
if
that
be
the
case
here,
we're
not
sure
it
is.
but,
if
there
is
that
difference,
that
choice,
we
suggest
should
be
left
up
to
the
shipper.
