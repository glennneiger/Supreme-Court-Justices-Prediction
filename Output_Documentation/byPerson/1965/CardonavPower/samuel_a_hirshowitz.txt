mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
new
york
has
done
everything
within
its
power
to
make
sure
that
every
citizens
to
give
an
opportunity
to
vote
and
the
very
exceptions
that
had
been
pointed
out
by
the
attorney
for
the
appellant
were
ethics
made
by
new
york
to
ease
the
literacy
requirement
so
that
more
people
would
be
given
a
chance
to
vote.
when
congress
passed
the
civil
rights
law
of
1964
in
which
it
had
a
provision
that
education
in
an
american
flag
school
where
the
language
was
principally
english
up
to
the
sixth
grade
was
a
test
for
voting
in
federal
elections.
new
york
state
very
promptly
passed
an
amendment
to
the
election
law
which
provided
that
equally
so
in
new
york,
persons
educated
in
puerto
rico
in
american
flag
schools
where
english
was
the
principal
language
of
instruction
up
to
sixth
grade
would
be
eligible
to
register
and
vote
in
new
york.
i
cite
that
to
show
the
interest
of
new
york
in
the
availability
of
citizens
for
voting.
moreover,
new
york
by
amendment
of
absentee
registration,
the
amendment
of
absentee
voting,
the
availability
of
voting
to
members
of
the
armed
forces
and
veterans
has
made
an
intelligent
effort
to
get
all
the
citizens
of
new
york
state
who
made
possibly
be
eligible
become
part
of
the
--
of
the
electorate
of
the
state.
and
so
for
--
for
instance,
the
attorney
general
of
puerto
rico
suggests
that
new
york
doesn't
care
what
happens
to
its
puerto
rican
population
is
a
tremendous
disservice
because
a
great
deal
of
money
and
effort
is
being
put
into
a
campaign
and
has
been
put
into
a
campaign
to
see
that
persons,
american
citizens
originally
from
puerto
rico
are
given
a
--
every
opportunity
to
vote
and
in
the
election
of
1965,
new
york
sent
automobiles,
trucks
to
the
various
areas
where
the
puerto
rican
population
was
located
in
order
to
make
it
easier
for
these
persons
to
come
out
and
register,
and
as
you've
heard,
actually
their
actually
there
only
8000
persons
that
took
the
opportunity
under
this
4
(e)
to
register
for
the
1965
election.
so
far,
there's
been
a
great
deal
of
discussion
about
the
power
of
congress
to
surround
a
certain
group
of
the
united
states
citizens
with
a
protection
which
follows
them
wherever
they
may
go
and
keeps
them
a
separate
and
distinct
class
in
any
--
in
any
society
in
which
they
may
live
and
i
want
to
point
out
to
you
that
the
effect
of
the
desired
result
sought
by
the
appellant
would
be
that
there
would
be
setup
an
enclave
in
the
city
such
as
new
york
where
all
the
puerto
ricans
would
read
puerto
rican
newspapers,
listen
to
puerto
rican
radio
stations
and
television
stations,
read
the
literature
in
puerto
rican
and
have
no
opportunity
to
integrate
into
society
around
them
either
in
new
york
city
or
california
whatever
the
case
may
be.
we
have
heard
from
the
appellant
in
the
morgan
case
that
congress
has
done
that
by
enacting
section
4
(e)
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
and
at
the
same
time,
we
have
heard
from
appellant
in
this
case
that
the
congress
did
it
long
ago
by
treaty,
by
statute,
by
the
united
nations'
charter,
and
by
the
constitution
of
puerto
rico.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
substantial
basis
to
any
of
the
contentions
the
appellant
here.
we
submit
further
that
something
very
important
has
been
lost
sight
of
along
the
way.
we
are
not
talking
here
about
puerto
rican
citizens.
we're
talking
about
new
yorkers.
the
fourteenth
amendment
defines
state
and
national
citizenship,
all
persons
born
or
naturalized
in
the
united
states
and
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
thereof,
are
citizens
of
united
states
and
of
the
state
wherein
they
reside.
the
appellant
here
is
entitled
to
be
treated
like
any
other
citizen
of
new
york.
new
york
cannot
create
a
separate
class
of
citizens
based
solely
on
the
fact
that
citizenship
was
a
crime
in
a
place
other
than
new
york.
the
very
idea
is
repugnant
to
the
basic
ideas
of
our
society
and
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
says
that
a
state
shall
not,
“deny
to
any
person
within
its
jurisdiction
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.”
appellant's
position
throws
into
question
the
power
of
the
state
to
set
voting
qualifications
of
its
citizens
and
to
have
those
qualifications
apply
equally
to
all
its
citizens.
yet,
the
constitution
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
left
that
power
beyond
question
so
long
as
the
qualification
set
by
the
state
bear
a
reasonable
relation
to
the
exercise
of
the
franchise
and
are
not
used
to
discriminate.
this
court
has
held
that
literacy
does
indeed
bear
a
reasonable
relation
to
the
exercise
of
the
franchise.
this
was
held
not
only
in
the
lassiter
case,
but
most
recently
in
the
harper
case,
mr.
justice
douglas
referred
to
the
same
intelligent
exercise
with
the
franchise
which
is
the
basic
foundation
of
literacy
test
in
english.
moreover,
it
cannot
be
denied
that
in
times
of
new
york
and
indeed
of
the
continental
united
states,
literacy
can
realistically
mean
only
english
literacy.
new
york
has
always
contained
the
greatest
diversity
and
language
of
any
state
and
consequently,
it's
not
pertinent
for
the
appellant
to
suggest
that
the
same
problems
may
exist
in
some
other
state.
in
new
york,
new
york
believes
that
one
common
language
serves
all
the
courtesies.
the
policy
of
one
language
has
served
new
york
well
as
it
has
served
united
states
well,
since
english
was
required
and
is
required
as
a
prerequisite
to
naturalization.
even
today,
in
new
york,
there
are
many
persons
whose
primary
language
is
not
english
and
it
is
not
spanish
but
the
policy
of
one
common
language
makes
for
integration
and
makes
a
workable
community.
english
literacy
is
a
reasonable
qualification
or
exercise
of
the
franchise
in
new
york.
the
ballot
itself
demonstrates
this.
each
year,
the
ballot
presents
a
long
list
of
candidates
and
a
wide
range
of
questions.
it
is
a
primary
concern
that
the
voter
have
the
ability
to
confront
the
ballot
independently
and
that
he
had
no
need
to
rely
on
any
person
or
group
to
act
as
an
intermediary
in
confronting
the
ballots.
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
english
literacy
qualification
in
new
york
was
initially
proposed
as
an
alternative
to
shorten
the
ballot
and
was
--
the
shortening
the
ballot
and
was
not
accepted
by
the
voter.
there
were
some
comments
this
morning
by
one
of
the
appellants
to
the
effect
that
--
in
the
newspapers
--
in
the
spanish
newspapers,
there
was
a
printing
of
the
ballot
in
spanish
and
of
the
constitutional
amendments.
now
as
far
as
our
information
is,
we
followed
the
puerto
rican
press,
this
was
not
the
case.
the
puerto
rican
press
is
mainly
concerned
with
discussion
of
life
and
events
in
puerto
rico
and
another
spanish
communities
and
little
attention
was
given
to
general
information.
supposing
the
president
of
united
states
makes
a
television
address,
he
makes
the
address
in
english.
the
--
not
only
the
content
of
address
--
of
the
address
but
the
manner
in
which
it
is
understood
by
the
voter
is
very
important
in
order
to
have
an
appreciation
of
the
sense
of
the
speech
by
the
president
or
possibly
by
a
candidate
of
president.
the
1960
election
turned
on
television
with
debates.
these
debates
are
conducted
in
english.
this
--
the
voter
whose
knowledge
would
only
be
in
spanish
would
only
get
this
permeated
to
him
through
the
spanish
press
and
through
the
spanish
radio
station
or
television.
to
achieve
an
independent
electorate,
new
york
is
interested
only
in
an
--
a
minimal
amount
of
english
literacy.
no
person
is
being
required
to
abandon
his
reading
of
material
in
other
languages
or
his
use
of
another
language
as
his
primary
medium
of
communication.
no
one
is
being
asked
only
to
acquire
enough
english
to
enable
him
if
he
chooses
to
participate
as
an
individual
in
the
business
of
governing
the
state.
now
in
our
brief,
we
have
inserted
comments
from
respectable
persons
and
groups
which
demonstrate
that
the
new
york
literacy
test
which
is
conduct
at
--
not
by
any
political
officials
but
by
the
board
of
regents
of
the
state
of
new
york,
the
education
department,
the
english
literacy
test
is
a
model
and
you
have
a
copy,
a
sample
copy
of
the
english
literacy
test
attached
as
an
appendix
in
our
brief.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
exemptions?
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
exempt
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
let
me
clarify
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no,
no,
no.
i
was
just
saying
your
honor
that
the
examination,
the
test
that
is
given
by
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
--
is
a
model,
is
here
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
--
as
a
model
throughout
the
country.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
now,
i
will
deal
with
the
exemptions
very
quickly.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
exemptions
are
--
no,
i
will
deal
with
him
right
now.
the
exemptions
are
to
--
men
in
the
armed
forces
who
get
an
honorable
discharge,
these
men
have
had
english
before
they've
been
inducted
into
the
service,
and
consequently
the
state
recognizes
it
by
saying
that
they
can
vote
without
going
through
another
literacy
test.
secondly,
the
veterans
falling
in
a
same
category
who
happen
to
be
in
veterans
hospitals
in
new
york
state,
not
in
a
county
of
their
residence
so
that
special
arrangements
must
be
made
for
absentee
registration
and
voting
for
these
persons.
now
as
to
the
spouses;
i
don't
know
today
and
i
don't
know
that
my
opponent
knows
today
that
a
spouse
or
a
child
of
a
veteran
has
got
a
right
to
register
merely
because
he
or
she
is
so
joining
in
the
veterans
hospital
with
a
sick
veteran.
the
statute,
section
115
which
is
incorporated
in
our
brief
does
not
make
that
clear
and
we
have
--
we
know
of
no
instance
where
a
spouse
of
a
veteran
has
registered
without
qualifying
by
a
literacy
test
or
making
an
affidavit
that
he
or
she
is
literate
in
the
english
language.
the
forum
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
but
the
only
thing
that
says
mr.
chief
justice
is,
it
sets
up
a
system
for
absentee
registration
where
a
spouse
is
living
with
a
veteran
at
a
veterans
hospital
somewhere
say
around
buffalo
and
they
should
register
and
vote
say
in
brooklyn.
some
efforts
should
be
made
not
to
disqualify
that
spouse
or
the
child
with
a
spouse
from
opportunity
to
vote.
and
as
i
said,
new
york
makes
every
effort
to
ensure
that
everybody
is
given
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
only
when
the
veteran
is
in
the
hospital
or
the
spouse
of
the
veteran
is
in
the
hospital
or
under
--
i
don't
know
too
much
about
the
federal
veterans
hospital
legislation
but
i
surmise
that
a
wife
of
a
veteran
may
have
a
right
to
get
hospitalization
in
veterans
hospital,
but
the
principles
are
the
same
to
provide
for
absentee
registration
and
voting.
it
does
not
say
in
there
that
you
then
have
to
qualify
by
english
literacy
and
that
we
have
contacted
the
new
york
city
board
of
elections
and
we
find
they
have
no
experience
of
anybody
who
has
registered
under
that
provision
without
qualifying
and
passing
a
literacy
test.
now
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
is
much
mr.
chief
justice
as
you
expressed
interest
in
that
point
and
the
argument
of
my
associate
mrs.
cone
under
the
4
(e)
case,
we
have
available,
i'd
like
to
make
available
to
the
court
in
a
further
appendix,
the
form
which
is
used
by
the
board
of
elections.
under
this
section
and
you
will
see
in
there,
there
is
a
provision
where
the
applicant
must
state
whether
he
or
she
has
a
literacy
certificate.
so
that
there
is
no
substantial
basis
to
the
argument
that
the
state
has
done
anything,
but
i
think
is
the
most
laudable
thing
here
as
tried
in
every
way
possible
to
give
everybody
the
opportunity
to
register
and
vote
regardless
of
the
fact
that
because
of
their
domicile
and
because
of
disability
they
may
be
unable
to
either
take
the
literacy
test
or
by
the
same
token
may
be
unable
to
register
because
they
are
located
somewhere
outside
their
voting
district.
this
is
in
the
same
line
as
i
think
the
most
frivolous
objection
that's
been
made
by
the
appellant
is
that
it's
a
badge
of
unconstitutionality
for
new
york
to
provide
that
if
you're
disabled
you
can
register
and
vote
provided
you
--
the
board
of
regents
or
the
examiner
is
satisfied
that
but
for
the
disability
you
would
be
entitled
to
vote.
the
same
provision
is
contained
in
the
federal
naturalization
act.
i
just
want
to
point
out
more
to
indicate
the
interest
that
new
york
has
in
getting
everybody
to
the
polls
and
voting.
in
1952,
new
york
provided
that
anyone
who's
naturalized
and
therefore
had
to
satisfy
the
federal
authorities
of
the
ability
to
read
and
write
english,
does
not
have
to
pass
a
literacy
test
as
exempt
for
it
and
the
ground
for
that
thing
that
having
already
satisfied
literacy
requirements,
it
would
be
unnecessary
for
them
to
pass
another
examination.
now,
this
goes
for
persons
of
all
races
and
all
creeds.
now
going
back
to
the
armed
forces
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
they
are
citizens,
and
because
they
have
not
up
to
that
point
satisfied
anybody
that
they
can
read
and
write
english,
sixth
grade
or
any
grade
for
that
matter.
now,
this
exemption
for
the
armed
services
and
exemption
for
veterans
no
matter
what
the
content
of
that
section
155
of
the
election
law
is,
is
without
the
regard
to
race,
creed
and
color.
there
is
no
purpose
of
discrimination
in
that
at
all
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
mr.
chief
justice,
in
that
same
research
that
we
did
in
new
york
county
involving
a
1964
election,
there
was
644,000
people
that
voted
in
that
presidential
election.
of
that
644,000,
there
were
12
people
who
registered,
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
register
from
--
as
discharged
veterans,
honorably
discharged
veterans.
of
those
12
people,
10
people
came
from
the
12th
assembly
district
in
new
york
county
and
if
you
may
remember
the
rosario
against
rockefeller
case,
the
12th
assembly
district
is
in
harlem,
one
of
the
heaviest
negro
districts.
two
people
who
registered
under
that
provision
came
from
the
10th
assembly
district
and
bore
spanish-speaking
names
so
the
beneficiaries
of
the
relaxation
or
the
exemption
as
you
call
it
mr.
chief
justice,
are
that
negroes
and
the
puerto
ricans
rather
than
those
who
were
educated
in
new
york
schools
would
not
need
to
benefit
of
this
exemption
at
all.
new
york's
requirement
cannot
be
challenged
as
being
unreasonable.
it
does
not
classify
its
citizens
in
any
way.
it
satisfies
the
test
and
the
classification
in
the
harper
case
and
any
case
that
decided
by
this
court.
there
is
not
the
slightest
basis
for
any
challenge
on
the
ground
of
discrimination.
it
applies
equally
to
all
citizens.
it
is
the
lack
of
a
classification
of
which
the
appellant
complaints
here.
she
insists
that
she
is
in
a
separate
category
and
that
spanish
learned
in
puerto
rican
schools
must
be
treated
equally
with
english
by
new
york.
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
guarantee
a
quality
of
language.
it
guarantees
a
quality
of
citizenship.
the
problems
that
may
arise
if
spanish
--
if
new
york
is
compelled
to
give
a
spanish
examination
were
as
illustrated
by
the
concession
made
by
my
line
and
opponent
that
similar
examination
would
have
to
be
arranged
for
people
who
were
educated
in
not
only
yiddish,
italian,
or
whatever
--
chinese
or
any
other
language.
now
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
you
mean
about
that
new
mexico
case?
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
we
suggest
that
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
we
suggested
in
our
original
brief
and
in
support
of
our
motion
to
dismiss
that
the
case
might
be
moot
and
in
a
footnote
in
our
present
brief,
we
have
renewed
that
suggestion
on
the
theory
that
if
4
(e)
is
upheld
by
this
court,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
questions
raised
in
the
cardona
case
and
that
i
believe
there's
a
general
principle
of
the
--
adopted
by
the
judiciary
to
avoid
constitutional
questions
if
that
can
be
accomplished.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
4
(e)
is
what
sir?
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
we
--
well,
new
york
law
wouldn't
be
in
conflict
under
4
(e).
congress,
whether
they
delegated
itself
the
power
of
preemption
as
to
the
new
york
law
to
the
extent
that
it
did
in
providing
that
the
sixth
grade
education
in
a
puerto
rican
school
is
equivalent
to
--
in
spanish
it
is
equivalent
to
the
literacy
required
by
new
york
law.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
law
is
not
in
conflict
because
as
i
understand
--
as
i
understand
the
argument
being
made
--
whether
it
was
made
this
morning
by
the
solicitor
general
and
by
his
associates,
they
were
contending
that
under
the
--
under
that
subdivision
5
of
fourteenth
amendment,
section
5,
the
congress
had
the
power
to
go
further
than
the
courts
in
implementing
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
we're
challenging
that
in
the
florie
case.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
but
then
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no.
it
wouldn't
in
conflict
there.
it
would
be
merely
a
--
an
application
by
congress
if
this
court
upheld
that
--
of
its
right
under
section
5
to
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
i
didn't
get
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
it
would
be
the
supreme
law,
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
and
would
be
followed
by
new
york
right
away
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
we're
arguing
in
the
first
case
that
the
4
(e)
is
invalid
for
the
primary
reason,
the
territory
argument,
i
don't
think
anybody
on
either
side
puts
much
stock
in,
but
the
primary
argument
being
that
in
order
for
a
congress
to
take
action,
they
must
first
show
that
there's
discrimination.
now
in
the
south
carolina
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
they
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
not
simply
necessary
to
protect
people
from
voting
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
that's
different
mr.
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
i'll
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
our
view
would
be
as
in
the
--
that
the
view
expressed
in
the
south
carolina
case
is
the
proper
application
of
section
5
because
in
that
case
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
in
the
opinion
to
indicate
the
great
effort
that
was
made
by
federal
authorities
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
section
5
as
i
recall
which
says,
congress
may
make
laws
from
foster
prohibitions
i
think.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes.
well
then
i
think
they
would
have
to
show
that
there
is
a
discrimination
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
extent
of
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
i
think
there's
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
this
would
be
too
easy
in
application
of
that
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
the
congress
would
be
enacting
legislation
without
any
proper
background.
i
think
the
position
that
caught
took
in
the
south
carolina
case
which
we
supported
by
a
brief
that
we
filed
is
a
proper
one
that
where
there
is
efforts
to
show
of
--
that
where
is
the
record
shows
that
efforts
have
been
made
by
the
federal
judicial
authorities
and
federal
administrative
officials
to
enforce
the
provisions
for
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
those
efforts
have
been
patently
unsuccessful
that
congress
has
a
right
to
step
in
and
otherwise,
they
could
step
in
on
every
single
occasion
without
any
prior
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well
mr.
justice
black,
the
best
illustration
on
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
what
happened
in
this
4
(e).
mister
--
senators
javits
and
kennedy,
sponsors
of
this
section
from
new
york
admitted
on
the
floor
of
congress
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
discrimination
by
new
york,
that's
in
the
congressional
record
and
we
cite
that
in
our
brief,
yet
congress
went
ahead
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
i
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
i
would
suggest
first
as
you
say
mr.
justice
black,
it
would
have
to
be
evidence
of
actual
discrimination
and
secondly,
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
as
stated
for
you.
secondly,
that
the
--
before
this
court
should
uphold
this
extension
of
congressional
power
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
court
should
be
impressed
with
the
fact
that
it
was
in
the
south
carolina
case
that
there's
a
long
history
of
frustration
of
judicial
and
administrative
process
to
command
respect
for
the
dictates
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
this
of
course
is
wholly
absent
from
this
case
and
the
only
attempted
evidence
of
that
is
to
go
back
to
1920
--
1915
to
1920
when
the
amendment
was
on
the
consideration.
sure,
there
were
people,
i
readily
admit
there
were
people
at
the
constitutional
convention
who
have
narrow-minded
concepts
for
the
enactment
of
these
--
this
constitutional
provision,
but
at
the
same
time,
there
were
hind-minded
people
and
we
have
quoted
from
one
or
more
of
those
people
whose
interest
was
in
the
promotion
of
the
welfare
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
new
york
has
done
everything
within
its
power
to
make
sure
that
every
citizens
to
give
an
opportunity
to
vote
and
the
very
exceptions
that
had
been
pointed
out
by
the
attorney
for
the
appellant
were
ethics
made
by
new
york
to
ease
the
literacy
requirement
so
that
more
people
would
be
given
a
chance
to
vote.
when
congress
passed
the
civil
rights
law
of
1964
in
which
it
had
a
provision
that
education
in
an
american
flag
school
where
the
language
was
principally
english
up
to
the
sixth
grade
was
a
test
for
voting
in
federal
elections.
new
york
state
very
promptly
passed
an
amendment
to
the
election
law
which
provided
that
equally
so
in
new
york,
persons
educated
in
puerto
rico
in
american
flag
schools
where
english
was
the
principal
language
of
instruction
up
to
sixth
grade
would
be
eligible
to
register
and
vote
in
new
york.
i
cite
that
to
show
the
interest
of
new
york
in
the
availability
of
citizens
for
voting.
moreover,
new
york
by
amendment
of
absentee
registration,
the
amendment
of
absentee
voting,
the
availability
of
voting
to
members
of
the
armed
forces
and
veterans
has
made
an
intelligent
effort
to
get
all
the
citizens
of
new
york
state
who
made
possibly
be
eligible
become
part
of
the
--
of
the
electorate
of
the
state.
and
so
for
--
for
instance,
the
attorney
general
of
puerto
rico
suggests
that
new
york
doesn't
care
what
happens
to
its
puerto
rican
population
is
a
tremendous
disservice
because
a
great
deal
of
money
and
effort
is
being
put
into
a
campaign
and
has
been
put
into
a
campaign
to
see
that
persons,
american
citizens
originally
from
puerto
rico
are
given
a
--
every
opportunity
to
vote
and
in
the
election
of
1965,
new
york
sent
automobiles,
trucks
to
the
various
areas
where
the
puerto
rican
population
was
located
in
order
to
make
it
easier
for
these
persons
to
come
out
and
register,
and
as
you've
heard,
actually
their
actually
there
only
8000
persons
that
took
the
opportunity
under
this
4
(e)
to
register
for
the
1965
election.
so
far,
there's
been
a
great
deal
of
discussion
about
the
power
of
congress
to
surround
a
certain
group
of
the
united
states
citizens
with
a
protection
which
follows
them
wherever
they
may
go
and
keeps
them
a
separate
and
distinct
class
in
any
--
in
any
society
in
which
they
may
live
and
i
want
to
point
out
to
you
that
the
effect
of
the
desired
result
sought
by
the
appellant
would
be
that
there
would
be
setup
an
enclave
in
the
city
such
as
new
york
where
all
the
puerto
ricans
would
read
puerto
rican
newspapers,
listen
to
puerto
rican
radio
stations
and
television
stations,
read
the
literature
in
puerto
rican
and
have
no
opportunity
to
integrate
into
society
around
them
either
in
new
york
city
or
california
whatever
the
case
may
be.
we
have
heard
from
the
appellant
in
the
morgan
case
that
congress
has
done
that
by
enacting
section
4
(e)
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
and
at
the
same
time,
we
have
heard
from
appellant
in
this
case
that
the
congress
did
it
long
ago
by
treaty,
by
statute,
by
the
united
nations'
charter,
and
by
the
constitution
of
puerto
rico.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
substantial
basis
to
any
of
the
contentions
the
appellant
here.
we
submit
further
that
something
very
important
has
been
lost
sight
of
along
the
way.
we
are
not
talking
here
about
puerto
rican
citizens.
we're
talking
about
new
yorkers.
the
fourteenth
amendment
defines
state
and
national
citizenship,
all
persons
born
or
naturalized
in
the
united
states
and
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
thereof,
are
citizens
of
united
states
and
of
the
state
wherein
they
reside.
the
appellant
here
is
entitled
to
be
treated
like
any
other
citizen
of
new
york.
new
york
cannot
create
a
separate
class
of
citizens
based
solely
on
the
fact
that
citizenship
was
a
crime
in
a
place
other
than
new
york.
the
very
idea
is
repugnant
to
the
basic
ideas
of
our
society
and
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
says
that
a
state
shall
not,
“deny
to
any
person
within
its
jurisdiction
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.”
appellant's
position
throws
into
question
the
power
of
the
state
to
set
voting
qualifications
of
its
citizens
and
to
have
those
qualifications
apply
equally
to
all
its
citizens.
yet,
the
constitution
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
left
that
power
beyond
question
so
long
as
the
qualification
set
by
the
state
bear
a
reasonable
relation
to
the
exercise
of
the
franchise
and
are
not
used
to
discriminate.
this
court
has
held
that
literacy
does
indeed
bear
a
reasonable
relation
to
the
exercise
of
the
franchise.
this
was
held
not
only
in
the
lassiter
case,
but
most
recently
in
the
harper
case,
mr.
justice
douglas
referred
to
the
same
intelligent
exercise
with
the
franchise
which
is
the
basic
foundation
of
literacy
test
in
english.
moreover,
it
cannot
be
denied
that
in
times
of
new
york
and
indeed
of
the
continental
united
states,
literacy
can
realistically
mean
only
english
literacy.
new
york
has
always
contained
the
greatest
diversity
and
language
of
any
state
and
consequently,
it's
not
pertinent
for
the
appellant
to
suggest
that
the
same
problems
may
exist
in
some
other
state.
in
new
york,
new
york
believes
that
one
common
language
serves
all
the
courtesies.
the
policy
of
one
language
has
served
new
york
well
as
it
has
served
united
states
well,
since
english
was
required
and
is
required
as
a
prerequisite
to
naturalization.
even
today,
in
new
york,
there
are
many
persons
whose
primary
language
is
not
english
and
it
is
not
spanish
but
the
policy
of
one
common
language
makes
for
integration
and
makes
a
workable
community.
english
literacy
is
a
reasonable
qualification
or
exercise
of
the
franchise
in
new
york.
the
ballot
itself
demonstrates
this.
each
year,
the
ballot
presents
a
long
list
of
candidates
and
a
wide
range
of
questions.
it
is
a
primary
concern
that
the
voter
have
the
ability
to
confront
the
ballot
independently
and
that
he
had
no
need
to
rely
on
any
person
or
group
to
act
as
an
intermediary
in
confronting
the
ballots.
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
english
literacy
qualification
in
new
york
was
initially
proposed
as
an
alternative
to
shorten
the
ballot
and
was
--
the
shortening
the
ballot
and
was
not
accepted
by
the
voter.
there
were
some
comments
this
morning
by
one
of
the
appellants
to
the
effect
that
--
in
the
newspapers
--
in
the
spanish
newspapers,
there
was
a
printing
of
the
ballot
in
spanish
and
of
the
constitutional
amendments.
now
as
far
as
our
information
is,
we
followed
the
puerto
rican
press,
this
was
not
the
case.
the
puerto
rican
press
is
mainly
concerned
with
discussion
of
life
and
events
in
puerto
rico
and
another
spanish
communities
and
little
attention
was
given
to
general
information.
supposing
the
president
of
united
states
makes
a
television
address,
he
makes
the
address
in
english.
the
--
not
only
the
content
of
address
--
of
the
address
but
the
manner
in
which
it
is
understood
by
the
voter
is
very
important
in
order
to
have
an
appreciation
of
the
sense
of
the
speech
by
the
president
or
possibly
by
a
candidate
of
president.
the
1960
election
turned
on
television
with
debates.
these
debates
are
conducted
in
english.
this
--
the
voter
whose
knowledge
would
only
be
in
spanish
would
only
get
this
permeated
to
him
through
the
spanish
press
and
through
the
spanish
radio
station
or
television.
to
achieve
an
independent
electorate,
new
york
is
interested
only
in
an
--
a
minimal
amount
of
english
literacy.
no
person
is
being
required
to
abandon
his
reading
of
material
in
other
languages
or
his
use
of
another
language
as
his
primary
medium
of
communication.
no
one
is
being
asked
only
to
acquire
enough
english
to
enable
him
if
he
chooses
to
participate
as
an
individual
in
the
business
of
governing
the
state.
now
in
our
brief,
we
have
inserted
comments
from
respectable
persons
and
groups
which
demonstrate
that
the
new
york
literacy
test
which
is
conduct
at
--
not
by
any
political
officials
but
by
the
board
of
regents
of
the
state
of
new
york,
the
education
department,
the
english
literacy
test
is
a
model
and
you
have
a
copy,
a
sample
copy
of
the
english
literacy
test
attached
as
an
appendix
in
our
brief.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
exemptions?
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
exempt
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
let
me
clarify
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no,
no,
no.
i
was
just
saying
your
honor
that
the
examination,
the
test
that
is
given
by
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
--
is
a
model,
is
here
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
--
as
a
model
throughout
the
country.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
now,
i
will
deal
with
the
exemptions
very
quickly.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
exemptions
are
--
no,
i
will
deal
with
him
right
now.
the
exemptions
are
to
--
men
in
the
armed
forces
who
get
an
honorable
discharge,
these
men
have
had
english
before
they've
been
inducted
into
the
service,
and
consequently
the
state
recognizes
it
by
saying
that
they
can
vote
without
going
through
another
literacy
test.
secondly,
the
veterans
falling
in
a
same
category
who
happen
to
be
in
veterans
hospitals
in
new
york
state,
not
in
a
county
of
their
residence
so
that
special
arrangements
must
be
made
for
absentee
registration
and
voting
for
these
persons.
now
as
to
the
spouses;
i
don't
know
today
and
i
don't
know
that
my
opponent
knows
today
that
a
spouse
or
a
child
of
a
veteran
has
got
a
right
to
register
merely
because
he
or
she
is
so
joining
in
the
veterans
hospital
with
a
sick
veteran.
the
statute,
section
115
which
is
incorporated
in
our
brief
does
not
make
that
clear
and
we
have
--
we
know
of
no
instance
where
a
spouse
of
a
veteran
has
registered
without
qualifying
by
a
literacy
test
or
making
an
affidavit
that
he
or
she
is
literate
in
the
english
language.
the
forum
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes,
but
the
only
thing
that
says
mr.
chief
justice
is,
it
sets
up
a
system
for
absentee
registration
where
a
spouse
is
living
with
a
veteran
at
a
veterans
hospital
somewhere
say
around
buffalo
and
they
should
register
and
vote
say
in
brooklyn.
some
efforts
should
be
made
not
to
disqualify
that
spouse
or
the
child
with
a
spouse
from
opportunity
to
vote.
and
as
i
said,
new
york
makes
every
effort
to
ensure
that
everybody
is
given
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
only
when
the
veteran
is
in
the
hospital
or
the
spouse
of
the
veteran
is
in
the
hospital
or
under
--
i
don't
know
too
much
about
the
federal
veterans
hospital
legislation
but
i
surmise
that
a
wife
of
a
veteran
may
have
a
right
to
get
hospitalization
in
veterans
hospital,
but
the
principles
are
the
same
to
provide
for
absentee
registration
and
voting.
it
does
not
say
in
there
that
you
then
have
to
qualify
by
english
literacy
and
that
we
have
contacted
the
new
york
city
board
of
elections
and
we
find
they
have
no
experience
of
anybody
who
has
registered
under
that
provision
without
qualifying
and
passing
a
literacy
test.
now
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
is
much
mr.
chief
justice
as
you
expressed
interest
in
that
point
and
the
argument
of
my
associate
mrs.
cone
under
the
4
(e)
case,
we
have
available,
i'd
like
to
make
available
to
the
court
in
a
further
appendix,
the
form
which
is
used
by
the
board
of
elections.
under
this
section
and
you
will
see
in
there,
there
is
a
provision
where
the
applicant
must
state
whether
he
or
she
has
a
literacy
certificate.
so
that
there
is
no
substantial
basis
to
the
argument
that
the
state
has
done
anything,
but
i
think
is
the
most
laudable
thing
here
as
tried
in
every
way
possible
to
give
everybody
the
opportunity
to
register
and
vote
regardless
of
the
fact
that
because
of
their
domicile
and
because
of
disability
they
may
be
unable
to
either
take
the
literacy
test
or
by
the
same
token
may
be
unable
to
register
because
they
are
located
somewhere
outside
their
voting
district.
this
is
in
the
same
line
as
i
think
the
most
frivolous
objection
that's
been
made
by
the
appellant
is
that
it's
a
badge
of
unconstitutionality
for
new
york
to
provide
that
if
you're
disabled
you
can
register
and
vote
provided
you
--
the
board
of
regents
or
the
examiner
is
satisfied
that
but
for
the
disability
you
would
be
entitled
to
vote.
the
same
provision
is
contained
in
the
federal
naturalization
act.
i
just
want
to
point
out
more
to
indicate
the
interest
that
new
york
has
in
getting
everybody
to
the
polls
and
voting.
in
1952,
new
york
provided
that
anyone
who's
naturalized
and
therefore
had
to
satisfy
the
federal
authorities
of
the
ability
to
read
and
write
english,
does
not
have
to
pass
a
literacy
test
as
exempt
for
it
and
the
ground
for
that
thing
that
having
already
satisfied
literacy
requirements,
it
would
be
unnecessary
for
them
to
pass
another
examination.
now,
this
goes
for
persons
of
all
races
and
all
creeds.
now
going
back
to
the
armed
forces
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
they
are
citizens,
and
because
they
have
not
up
to
that
point
satisfied
anybody
that
they
can
read
and
write
english,
sixth
grade
or
any
grade
for
that
matter.
now,
this
exemption
for
the
armed
services
and
exemption
for
veterans
no
matter
what
the
content
of
that
section
155
of
the
election
law
is,
is
without
the
regard
to
race,
creed
and
color.
there
is
no
purpose
of
discrimination
in
that
at
all
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
mr.
chief
justice,
in
that
same
research
that
we
did
in
new
york
county
involving
a
1964
election,
there
was
644,000
people
that
voted
in
that
presidential
election.
of
that
644,000,
there
were
12
people
who
registered,
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
register
from
--
as
discharged
veterans,
honorably
discharged
veterans.
of
those
12
people,
10
people
came
from
the
12th
assembly
district
in
new
york
county
and
if
you
may
remember
the
rosario
against
rockefeller
case,
the
12th
assembly
district
is
in
harlem,
one
of
the
heaviest
negro
districts.
two
people
who
registered
under
that
provision
came
from
the
10th
assembly
district
and
bore
spanish-speaking
names
so
the
beneficiaries
of
the
relaxation
or
the
exemption
as
you
call
it
mr.
chief
justice,
are
that
negroes
and
the
puerto
ricans
rather
than
those
who
were
educated
in
new
york
schools
would
not
need
to
benefit
of
this
exemption
at
all.
new
york's
requirement
cannot
be
challenged
as
being
unreasonable.
it
does
not
classify
its
citizens
in
any
way.
it
satisfies
the
test
and
the
classification
in
the
harper
case
and
any
case
that
decided
by
this
court.
there
is
not
the
slightest
basis
for
any
challenge
on
the
ground
of
discrimination.
it
applies
equally
to
all
citizens.
it
is
the
lack
of
a
classification
of
which
the
appellant
complaints
here.
she
insists
that
she
is
in
a
separate
category
and
that
spanish
learned
in
puerto
rican
schools
must
be
treated
equally
with
english
by
new
york.
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
guarantee
a
quality
of
language.
it
guarantees
a
quality
of
citizenship.
the
problems
that
may
arise
if
spanish
--
if
new
york
is
compelled
to
give
a
spanish
examination
were
as
illustrated
by
the
concession
made
by
my
line
and
opponent
that
similar
examination
would
have
to
be
arranged
for
people
who
were
educated
in
not
only
yiddish,
italian,
or
whatever
--
chinese
or
any
other
language.
now
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
you
mean
about
that
new
mexico
case?
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
we
suggest
that
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
we
suggested
in
our
original
brief
and
in
support
of
our
motion
to
dismiss
that
the
case
might
be
moot
and
in
a
footnote
in
our
present
brief,
we
have
renewed
that
suggestion
on
the
theory
that
if
4
(e)
is
upheld
by
this
court,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
questions
raised
in
the
cardona
case
and
that
i
believe
there's
a
general
principle
of
the
--
adopted
by
the
judiciary
to
avoid
constitutional
questions
if
that
can
be
accomplished.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
4
(e)
is
what
sir?
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
we
--
well,
new
york
law
wouldn't
be
in
conflict
under
4
(e).
congress,
whether
they
delegated
itself
the
power
of
preemption
as
to
the
new
york
law
to
the
extent
that
it
did
in
providing
that
the
sixth
grade
education
in
a
puerto
rican
school
is
equivalent
to
--
in
spanish
it
is
equivalent
to
the
literacy
required
by
new
york
law.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
law
is
not
in
conflict
because
as
i
understand
--
as
i
understand
the
argument
being
made
--
whether
it
was
made
this
morning
by
the
solicitor
general
and
by
his
associates,
they
were
contending
that
under
the
--
under
that
subdivision
5
of
fourteenth
amendment,
section
5,
the
congress
had
the
power
to
go
further
than
the
courts
in
implementing
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
we're
challenging
that
in
the
florie
case.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
but
then
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no.
it
wouldn't
in
conflict
there.
it
would
be
merely
a
--
an
application
by
congress
if
this
court
upheld
that
--
of
its
right
under
section
5
to
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
i
didn't
get
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
it
would
be
the
supreme
law,
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
and
would
be
followed
by
new
york
right
away
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
we're
arguing
in
the
first
case
that
the
4
(e)
is
invalid
for
the
primary
reason,
the
territory
argument,
i
don't
think
anybody
on
either
side
puts
much
stock
in,
but
the
primary
argument
being
that
in
order
for
a
congress
to
take
action,
they
must
first
show
that
there's
discrimination.
now
in
the
south
carolina
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
they
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
not
simply
necessary
to
protect
people
from
voting
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
that's
different
mr.
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
i'll
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
our
view
would
be
as
in
the
--
that
the
view
expressed
in
the
south
carolina
case
is
the
proper
application
of
section
5
because
in
that
case
the
court
went
out
of
its
way
in
the
opinion
to
indicate
the
great
effort
that
was
made
by
federal
authorities
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
section
5
as
i
recall
which
says,
congress
may
make
laws
from
foster
prohibitions
i
think.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
yes.
well
then
i
think
they
would
have
to
show
that
there
is
a
discrimination
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
the
extent
of
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
i
think
there's
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
this
would
be
too
easy
in
application
of
that
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
the
congress
would
be
enacting
legislation
without
any
proper
background.
i
think
the
position
that
caught
took
in
the
south
carolina
case
which
we
supported
by
a
brief
that
we
filed
is
a
proper
one
that
where
there
is
efforts
to
show
of
--
that
where
is
the
record
shows
that
efforts
have
been
made
by
the
federal
judicial
authorities
and
federal
administrative
officials
to
enforce
the
provisions
for
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
those
efforts
have
been
patently
unsuccessful
that
congress
has
a
right
to
step
in
and
otherwise,
they
could
step
in
on
every
single
occasion
without
any
prior
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
no.
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well
mr.
justice
black,
the
best
illustration
on
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
what
happened
in
this
4
(e).
mister
--
senators
javits
and
kennedy,
sponsors
of
this
section
from
new
york
admitted
on
the
floor
of
congress
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
discrimination
by
new
york,
that's
in
the
congressional
record
and
we
cite
that
in
our
brief,
yet
congress
went
ahead
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
i
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
i
would
suggest
first
as
you
say
mr.
justice
black,
it
would
have
to
be
evidence
of
actual
discrimination
and
secondly,
--
mr.
samuel
a.
hirshowitz
well,
as
stated
for
you.
secondly,
that
the
--
before
this
court
should
uphold
this
extension
of
congressional
power
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
court
should
be
impressed
with
the
fact
that
it
was
in
the
south
carolina
case
that
there's
a
long
history
of
frustration
of
judicial
and
administrative
process
to
command
respect
for
the
dictates
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
this
of
course
is
wholly
absent
from
this
case
and
the
only
attempted
evidence
of
that
is
to
go
back
to
1920
--
1915
to
1920
when
the
amendment
was
on
the
consideration.
sure,
there
were
people,
i
readily
admit
there
were
people
at
the
constitutional
convention
who
have
narrow-minded
concepts
for
the
enactment
of
these
--
this
constitutional
provision,
but
at
the
same
time,
there
were
hind-minded
people
and
we
have
quoted
from
one
or
more
of
those
people
whose
interest
was
in
the
promotion
of
the
welfare
of
the
state
of
new
york.
