mr.
paul
o'dwyer
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
think
it
might
be
well
at
the
outset
to
give
some
facts
surrounding
the
history
of
literacy
test
in
the
19
states
where
they
are
in
existence.
we've
had
the
problem
previously.
one
of
the
counsel
who
just
addressed
you
stated
and
gave
the
outline
and
the
background
of
the
enactments
in
both
massachusetts
and
connecticut
and
i
may
say
that
the
history
of
literate
--
of
literacy
test
indicate
that
in
practically
every
state
where
they
exist,
they
were
--
they
were
determining
a
right
to
exclude
people
from
voting
rather
than
as
qualifications
for
voting.
i
must
say
that
i
was
somewhat
surprised
to
hear
the
literacy
tests
that
the
statute
in
new
york
prescribed
as
benign
by
comparison
with
the
others.
i
may
say
that
it
was
enacted
in
1922
at
a
time
when
there
was
absolutely
no
necessity
to
enact
a
literacy
test
with
respect
to
native
born
new
yorkers.
they'd
had
a
school
system
at
that
time
for
almost
a
century.
many
attempts
had
been
made
previously
in
the
state
of
new
york
to
enact
literacy
test.
in
the
convention
of
1848,
they
almost
got
one
through
but
there
were
too
many
people
that
were
talking
dutch
in
the
state
at
that
time
so
consequently,
they
weren't
able
to
put
it
across.
1915,
they
tried
it
in
1917,
it
was
successful.
the
lady
who
appeared
here
talked
about
the
fact
that
it
was
meant
for
the
purpose
of
attempting
to
saying
the
people
of
new
york
who
are
not
conversing
with
english
in
the
industrial
plants
and
that
it
had
for
its
purpose
assisting
in
many
other
ways.
i
may
say
to
that
the
history
of
the
hearings
more
or
less
belies
that.
i
am
turning
to
the
brief
of
the
american-jewish
congress
at
page
27
to
read
some
of
the
things
were
said
at
that
time.
mr.
--
one
of
the
arguments
presented
on
behalf
of
it
is
as
follows.
more
precious
even
than
forms
of
government
or
the
mental
qualities
of
our
race
by
those
stand
on
impaired
all
are
safe.
they're
exposed
to
a
single
danger
and
that
is
by
constantly
changing
our
voting
citizenship
through
the
wholesale
but
valuable
and
necessary
infusion
of
southern
and
eastern
european
races.
the
danger
has
begun,
we
should
check
it.
that
was
on
the
one
side
proposing
the
change.
on
the
other
was
senator
wagner,
obviously,
that
proposal
is
directed
against
the
foreign
born
american.
remembering
that
the
great
mass
of
foreigners
that
come
annually
to
our
shores
are
simulated
into
and
become
part
and
parcel
of
the
american
people
because
they
strive
and
hope
and
succeed
in
acquiring
the
right
to
vote.
you
cannot
recognize
in
the
amendment,
a
clandestine
effort
to
prevent
this
assimilation
of
alien
blood
without
citizenship
and
to
segregate
and
exclude
the
foreigner
from
the
rights,
the
privileges,
and
the
opportunities
which
we
have
always
held
out
to
all
men.
i
may
say
that
at
that
very
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
whatever
--
whatever
the
end
result
was,
i
am
speaking
here
to
the
point
of
the
polluted
origin
of
the
legislation
in
the
first
instance.
it
was
at
that
time
that
five
elected
assemblymen
were
prevented
from
being
seated
in
the
new
york
state
legislature
and
a
hearing
of
the
type
which
has
never
before
happen
in
the
state
of
new
york
or
anywhere
else
followed
it.
it
was
in
the
middle
of
this
type
of
hysteria
that
this
enactment
was
passed.
it
was
condemned
by
governor
smith.
it
was
condemned
by
senator
wagner.
it
was
condemned
by
the
progress
of
that
date
but
it
was
enacted
in
the
state
of
hysteria.
in
connection
with
the
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
it
was
signed
by
the
governor.
it
was
after
it
had
this
period
of
hysteria
had
prevailed.
i
may
say
that
we
come
to
the
questions
which
are
raised
here
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
the
4
(e)
and
the
new
york
state
statute
are
intertwined
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
they
are.
it
would
seem
that
the
justification
for
the
passage
of
4
(e)
has
been
because
of
the
discriminatory
character
of
the
legis
--
new
york
state
legislation.
it
would
seem
that
one
of
the
things
which
i
think
has
been
overlooked
is
that
in
somewhere
about
1946
as
a
result
of
a
committee
from
columbia
university,
a
travel
to
puerto
rico
to
examine
the
educational
facilities
there
and
the
results
upon
the
children
of
puerto
rican
schools
and
found
that
our
attempt
to
englishized
had
totally
failed
and
it
was
as
a
result
of
that
was
a
new
method
was
developed
whereby
this
appellee
and
other
children
born
in
puerto
rico
have
no
choice
but
to
read
and
write,
and
learn
american
history
and
civics
through
the
medium
of
spanish.
so
that
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
we
have
--
we
are
a
country
of
two
languages.
we
have
fostered
one
throughout
this
island.
we
have
developed
it
there.
of
the
19
states
which
have
a
literacy
test,
there
are
some
like
the
state
of
louisiana
which
permitted
at
least
in
the
language
of
one's
forebears
in
the
mother
tongue
as
well
as
in
english.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
no.
the
petitioner
was
born,
raised,
and
educated
and
voted
in
puerto
rico
before
coming
to
new
york
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
she
came
about
approximately
1950.
it
was
the
--
at
that
time,
the
committee
from
columbia
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
she
has
not
learned
any
english
since
that
time.
she
has
not
learned
sufficient
to
be
able
to
engage
in
conversation
and
i
may
say
parenthetically
there
are
many
people
who
are
not
capable
of
doing
it
even
though
they're
be
highly
literate
in
another
language.
they
have
blocks
with
respect
to
it
and
it
is
not
on
common
in
a
place
like
new
york
city
where
we
have
three
daily
newspapers
dealing
with
all
problems
of
history,
civics,
and
politics,
where
we
have
radio
stations
and
television
stations
dealing
in
the
spanish
language
that
they
continue
to
do
that.
but
one
other
things
which
i'm
afraid
that
those
of
us
who
are
constantly
confused,
the
puerto
rican
with
every
other
foreigner
who
comes
to
the
shore.
this
man
is
came
as
--
became
a
citizen
by
virtue
of
the
treaty
of
paris
in
1898,
the
jones
act
in
1917,
and
by
further
enactments
of
the
congress
to
the
united
states
which
gave
a
sanction
to
the
constitution
of
puerto
rico.
and
then
in
1947
when
the
united
states
government,
went
before
the
united
nations
and/or
to
establish
our
right,
not
to
make
various
reports
from
time
to
time
under
the
provisions
of
the
colonial
powers,
we
obtained
and
received
permission
from
the
united
nations
to
deal
with
this
into
the
--
provide
dealing
with
that
in
that
fashion.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
no,
it
is
not
sir.
it
is
not
moot
for
the
following
reasons.
i
think
if
the
whole
--
i
do
--
i
contend
that
even
though
that
congress
of
the
united
states
may
have
a
right
to
impose
literary
requirements,
it
may
not
impose
literary
requirements
if
the
purpose
of
that
is
to
deprive
people
from
voting
rather
than
to
create
a
climate
in
which
they
may
vote
intelligently.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
that
only
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
no.
no,
it
will
still
leave
open
the
requirement
with
respect
to
a
certificate
from
a
sixth
grade
school
--
sixth
grade
in
any
school
under
the
american
flag.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
it
will
not
include
puerto
rican
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes.
it
would
include
that
puerto
rican
who
is
involved
here,
but
i
respectfully
submit
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
this,
it's
true.
under
the
--
that's
true.
this
martha
cardona
but
the
next
one
coming
before
this
court
would
not
be
solved.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
that
--
however,
i
may
say
that
i
think
--
i
think
we
should
to
attempt
to
solve
the
cardona
case
first
and
then
proceed
from
that
to
deal
with
the
4
(e)
case
because
on
the
contrary,
i
think
if
the
--
in
order
to
solve
the
--
to
the
case
arising
under
provision
4
(e),
this
court
must
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
new
york
state
law
is
discriminatory.
so,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
you
have
solved
that
problem
in
the
first
instance,
you
may
more
easily
solve
this
--
the
one
which
was
previously
argued.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
you
will
never
--
precisely
judge
brennan.
that's
precisely
the
situation.
if
you
solve
the
problem
arising
here
and
you
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
new
york
statute
is
discriminatory
because
of
the
grandfather
clauses,
the
unusual
exceptions
with
respect
to
it
and
which
have
no
relationship
with
the
quality
of
persons
who
are
preparing
to
vote,
then
by
that
token
that
is
the
end
of
that
problem
not
only
with
respect
to
--
it
is
certainly
is
a
process
in
the
state
of
new
york
is
concern
and
we
--
you
never
need
to
arrive
at
the
other.
i
don't
know
how
this
effect
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
well,
it
will
dispose
of
the
total
because
it
will
have
done
far
deeper.
it
would
seem
to
me
and
i'm
not
going
to
--
i
don't
want
to
prejudice
their
case
presented
here
ahead
of
me,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
from
listening
to
the
argument
that
the
court
must
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
a
basic
reason
for
the
enactment
of
4
(e),
that
there
was
a
reason
based
upon
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
we
present
that
evidence
in
the
first
instance
as
we
have
here,
that
solves
the
problem
--
the
total
problem
and
that
would
be
known
--
well,
perhaps
i
better
not
get
off
into
arguing
the
other
fellow's
case,
but
as
seemingly
in
any
event
it
would
--
it
would
be
a
requirement
that
you
come
to
that
conclusion.
there
is
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes,
it
would
seem
that
way
and
i
may
say
that
it
is
not
so
that
we
are
confined
purely
to
the
--
to
--
we
confine
totally
and
completely
to
the
pronouncements
on
the
day
when
this
was
argued
which
incidentally
was
three
days
after
the
arguments
and
all
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
in
the
cardona
case
and
all
of
the
people
who
did
the
arguing,
both
in
the
house
and
in
the
senate
had
before
them
the
various
information
which
was
available
in
the
case
at
that
time
and
based
their
arguments
on
the
cardona
case,
but
there
was
--
there
were
various
hearings
before
the
congressional
committees
dealing
with
voting
practices
in
the
various
states
previously
and
among
them
was
the
inequities
in
connection
with
the
establishment
of
these
laws.
it
would
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
the
hearings
which
took
place
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
–
not
precisely
at
that
time
judge
brennan
but
took
place
about
two
years
before
that,
had
also
call
into
question
these
very
enactments
not
merely
here,
but
in
other
places
as
well.
now,
we've
had
--
we'd
talked
about
here
of
the
state
of
new
mexico.
i
may
say
in
the
early
stages
of
it,
we
are
--
we're
accustomed
to
dealing
with
spanish,
apparently
it
has
come
up
as
a
problem
somewhat
before
at
the
constitutional
convention
before
that
state
was
admitted
into
statehood.
the
presiding
officer
did
not
know
how
to
speak
english
and
talking
again
with
respect
to
the
possibility
that
new
york
may
have
to
supply
certain
information
in
spanish
to
the
voters
so
that
they
can
properly
understand
the
amendments
and
resolutions
which
appear
in
the
voting
machine,
i
may
say
and
i
have
made
available
to
the
court,
literature
in
which
the
--
the
state
of
new
york
went
out
of
its
way
to
give
all
this
information
in
to
spanish
to
the
perspective
taxpayer.
and
the
--
if
the
--
if
they
can
go
to
the
trouble
of
providing
the
taxpayer
with
instructions
in
spanish
as
to
how
to
fill
out
a
complicated
form,
it's
not
too
much
to
ask
that
perhaps
they
give
some
of
the
instructions
beforehand.
i
may
stay
however
parenthetically,
that
very
few
people
read
the
amendments
or
resolutions
in
the
voting
machine.
if
they're
did,
we
couldn't
possibly
end
our
voting
in
one
day.
everybody
that
votes
on
these
which
are
precious
few
and
make
themselves
acquainted
with
the
provisions
long
beforehand
and
are
in
position
to
deal
intelligently
with
it.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
the
pronouncement
the
--
a
statement
has
been
made
on
the
record
here
that
from
--
on
the
basis
of
the
information
which
is
imparted
to
the
spanish-speaking
community
in
new
york
are
through
the
newspapers,
through
the
magazines,
and
through
the
radio
that
if
they
are
as
intelligent,
the
spanish-speaking
voter
is
just
as
in
--
as
just
enlightened
on
the
issues
as
any
of
the
other
fellow
citizens
who
are
not
spanish-speaking.
and
it
presupposes
too
of
course
during
the
course
of
the
argument
that
everybody
from
all
over
the
state
of
new
york
is
fully
conversing
as
they
go
into
poll
with
respect
to
each
and
every
problem
presented
and
of
course
have
--
where
situation
has
nothing
to
do
with
language.
truth
to
say
we
know
that
this
is
not
quite
so.
this
is
an
area
in
which
these
people
are
as
--
as
has
been
stated
here
a
few
moments
ago
are
inducted
into
the
united
states
army
are
assigned
to
a
regimen
where
spanish
is
spoken
who
go
to
school
and
have
no
choice
with
respect
to
the
language
that
they
are
taught.
this
is
done
not
merely
through
local
taxes,
but
it
is
done
through
federal
grants
and
aid
under
the
sanction
and
under
the
approval
of
the
united
states
and
certainly,
to
have
under
these
circumstances
where
they
come
to
the
--
to
the
mainland,
have
the
state
of
new
york
through
its
invidious
statutes
depriving
of
the
right
to
vote
because
of
the
fact
that
they
were
brought
up
under
circumstances
over
which
they
had
no
control
certainly
requires
that
this
court
take
action
and
strike
it
down.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
that's
right
sir.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
indeed
your
honor.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
that
is
correct.
you're
not
on
--
i
have
presented
here
what
i
regard
arguments
in
the
brief
and
also
presented
on
the
brief
of
the
amicus
curiae
to
the
effect
that
this
--
the
grandfather
provisions
of
the
enactment
itself
are
sufficient
to
permit
this
court
to
strike
it
down
if
for
no
other
reason
dealing
not
merely
with
spanish,
not
with
any
other
language
but
just
on
that
basis
alone.
but
in
addition
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
correct.
it
should
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
if
--
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
follow
you
judge
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
well,
this
is
on
the
more
--
in
the
broader
aspect.
now,
if
they
eliminated
that
i
still
believe
that
under
the
circumstances
here
in
view
of
the
fact
that
a
whole
class
of
american
citizens
who
do
not
knock
at
the
door
from
the
immigrant
ship
who
are
here
by
virtue
of
their
own
inherent
right
as
citizen
for
three
and
four
generations,
that
new
york
state
may
not
make
an
enactment
which
prevents
them
from
exercising
a
rather
sacred
right
and
so,
even
if
you
eliminate
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
it
would
be
solved
insofar
as
this
particular
person
is
concerned
is
true.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
no
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
that
only
a
person
who
can
pass
the
sixth
grade
education
in
spanish.
i
am
talking
--
and
present
a
certificate
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
may
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
would
say
that
new
york
state
insofar
as
a
spanish-speaking
puerto
rican
citizen
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
would
say
that
if
--
that
would
fall
under
the
grandfather
provisions
enacted
in
1922,
that
the
whole
thing
collapses
by
virtue
of
that.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i'm
not
able
to
answer
that
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
--
it's
an
interesting
question
raise
here
somebody
that
went
to
a
foreign
country
when
they
were
a
child
and
came
back.
i
don't
know
whether
a
democracy
we
can
take
care
of
each
in
individual
situation
and
i'm
quite
certain
as
our
laws
are
developed,
we
do
--
do
an
injustice
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
it
would
seem
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
there
are
some
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
--
there
are
many
--
i
assumed.
i
--
i'm
not
wise
enough
to
be
able
to
follow
the
argument
with
that
conclusion,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
logic
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
insofar
as
they're
concern
as
well.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes.
yes,
indeed
to
any
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes,
sir
and
when
we
have
--
when
we
come
to
the
whole
--
we
had
then
--
we
have
to
survey
--
in
the
light
of
this
argument,
we
have
to
survey
whether
or
not
the
literacy
test
really
has
done
what
it
is
set
out
to
do
or
whether
or
not
as
historically
is
the
fact
that
it
was
a
provision
to
prevent
people
from
voting
every
state
where
it
existed
and
that
i
may
say
that
apparently
31
states
have
done
very
well
without
it.
many
of
the
members
of
this
court
have
come
from
states
where
they
don't
have
a
literacy
test
and
it
would
be
invidious
indeed
to
suggest
that
in
these
states
where
there
is
no
literacy
test
the
type
of
legislation,
the
type
of
enactments
that
come
from
it
to
these
circumstances
are
in
theory
to
those
in
areas
where
the
literacy
test
does
in
fact
prevail.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
would
say
that
any
enactment
by
congress
under
those
circumstances
would
be
invalid.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
if
the
state
of
new
york
which
will
enact
--
to
make
some
enactment
which
would
grant
literacy
--
which
would
grant
voting
rights
to
a
citizen
and
congress
were
to
take
that
right
away
by
its
enactment,
i
think
that
enactment
should
be
--
should
be
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
because
judge
black
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
because
judge
black,
i
would
regard
the
grabble
of
the
complaint
to
be
taking
rights
away
and
that's
what
new
york
state
would
not
have
done
under
the
proposal
which
you
have
suggested.
whereas
on
the
contrary,
congress
would
be
taking
away
something
that
a
state
had
enacted
and
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
right.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes.
i
would
say
that
if
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
would
say,
that
unless
there
is
--
i
do
not
contend
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
do
not
contend
here
that
the
states
do
not
have
a
right
to
setup
reasonable
requirements
with
respect
to
voting.
i
do
say
that
every
place
they
have
done
it,
it
has
been
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
people
from
voting
and
therefore
this
court
should
look
with
more
scrutiny
into
each
one
--
particularly,
one
such
as
we
are
here
--
we
have
here
under
consideration.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
would
say
that
congress
at
that
point
if
the
state
of
new
york
extend
its
power
to
those
to
--
to
vote
and
that
congress
took
that
power
away
that
such
an
act
would
be
unconstitutional
because
they
would
have
been
taking
away
a
right
from
the
citizen
that
it
had
acquired
under
the
state.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
under
the
state
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
would
say
that
the
state
is
supreme
provided
that
it
is
not
done
for
the
purpose
and
it
does
not
interfere
with
--
as
it
does
here,
rights
which
had
been
acquired
by
the
treaty
of
paris,
by
enactments
of
congress,
by
proposal
submitted
to
the
united
nations
which
makes
this
a
unique
and
different
situation
and
i
would
say
that
congress
--
that
the
state
would
be
supreme
with
the
development
of
its
voting
rights
provided
however,
that
it
did
not
interfere
with
the
basic
constitutional
rights
of
any
citizens
such
as
in
--
judge
black,
you
asked
whether
or
not
there
was
any
proposal
here
--
there
was
any
suggestion
that
this
was
violative
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
we
make
--
we
claim
that
it
is,
not
under
the
colored
provisions
but
under
the
race
provision.
it
is
our
suggestion
here
that
puerto
ricans
in
the
sense
are
a
race
and
a
race
that
are
here
in
the
sense
that
they
have
a
language.
they
have
a
common
tradition.
they
have
a
common
purpose
for
over
300
years
in
their
island
home
and
it
is
our
suggestion
here
that
when
any
law,
even
though
it
may
not
have
interfered
with
them
at
the
time
of
its
enactment,
if
later,
it
did
actually
interfere
with
their
rights
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
that
it
should
be
stricken
down.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
any
country
--
american
citizens
in
any
country,
i
would
--
well,
i'm
not
prepared
to
argue
that.
it
would
seem
logically
to
me
that
if
american
citizen
for
some
reason
or
another
found
himself
in
another
country
and
was
brought
up
and
had
to
learn
his
language
--
some
other
language
that
under
these
circumstances
i
suppose
it
would
be
logical
to
follow
through
and
suggest
that
the
law
would
be
unconstitutional
as
to
such
person.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
may
i
just
for
a
moment.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
your
honors
that
i
think
that
the
burden
placed
upon
this
court
in
dealing
with
the
4
(e)
matter
has
been
considerably
lightened
by
consideration
of
the
facts
outlined
in
the
cardona
case
which
have
not
been
questioned.
all
of
the
allegations
contained
in
the
record
are
without
contradiction.
in
so
consequently
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
point
where
you
feel
that
congress
is
justified
in
the
enactment
of
4
(e)
having
first
from
to
the
conclusion
that
by
virtue
of
the
grandfather
clause
and
the
other
provisions
and
the
other
arguments
which
are
made
that
the
law
is
unconstitutional
in
the
first
--
in
the
first
place
then
this
presents
a
basis
for
the
--
for
the
establishment
of
the
4
(e)
if
the
law
at
the
present
time.
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
they
are
intertwined
to
the
point
for
a
consideration
of
the
first
case
must
come
after
a
full
and
complete
consideration
of
the
cardona
case.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
think
it
might
be
well
at
the
outset
to
give
some
facts
surrounding
the
history
of
literacy
test
in
the
19
states
where
they
are
in
existence.
we've
had
the
problem
previously.
one
of
the
counsel
who
just
addressed
you
stated
and
gave
the
outline
and
the
background
of
the
enactments
in
both
massachusetts
and
connecticut
and
i
may
say
that
the
history
of
literate
--
of
literacy
test
indicate
that
in
practically
every
state
where
they
exist,
they
were
--
they
were
determining
a
right
to
exclude
people
from
voting
rather
than
as
qualifications
for
voting.
i
must
say
that
i
was
somewhat
surprised
to
hear
the
literacy
tests
that
the
statute
in
new
york
prescribed
as
benign
by
comparison
with
the
others.
i
may
say
that
it
was
enacted
in
1922
at
a
time
when
there
was
absolutely
no
necessity
to
enact
a
literacy
test
with
respect
to
native
born
new
yorkers.
they'd
had
a
school
system
at
that
time
for
almost
a
century.
many
attempts
had
been
made
previously
in
the
state
of
new
york
to
enact
literacy
test.
in
the
convention
of
1848,
they
almost
got
one
through
but
there
were
too
many
people
that
were
talking
dutch
in
the
state
at
that
time
so
consequently,
they
weren't
able
to
put
it
across.
1915,
they
tried
it
in
1917,
it
was
successful.
the
lady
who
appeared
here
talked
about
the
fact
that
it
was
meant
for
the
purpose
of
attempting
to
saying
the
people
of
new
york
who
are
not
conversing
with
english
in
the
industrial
plants
and
that
it
had
for
its
purpose
assisting
in
many
other
ways.
i
may
say
to
that
the
history
of
the
hearings
more
or
less
belies
that.
i
am
turning
to
the
brief
of
the
american-jewish
congress
at
page
27
to
read
some
of
the
things
were
said
at
that
time.
mr.
--
one
of
the
arguments
presented
on
behalf
of
it
is
as
follows.
more
precious
even
than
forms
of
government
or
the
mental
qualities
of
our
race
by
those
stand
on
impaired
all
are
safe.
they're
exposed
to
a
single
danger
and
that
is
by
constantly
changing
our
voting
citizenship
through
the
wholesale
but
valuable
and
necessary
infusion
of
southern
and
eastern
european
races.
the
danger
has
begun,
we
should
check
it.
that
was
on
the
one
side
proposing
the
change.
on
the
other
was
senator
wagner,
obviously,
that
proposal
is
directed
against
the
foreign
born
american.
remembering
that
the
great
mass
of
foreigners
that
come
annually
to
our
shores
are
simulated
into
and
become
part
and
parcel
of
the
american
people
because
they
strive
and
hope
and
succeed
in
acquiring
the
right
to
vote.
you
cannot
recognize
in
the
amendment,
a
clandestine
effort
to
prevent
this
assimilation
of
alien
blood
without
citizenship
and
to
segregate
and
exclude
the
foreigner
from
the
rights,
the
privileges,
and
the
opportunities
which
we
have
always
held
out
to
all
men.
i
may
say
that
at
that
very
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
whatever
--
whatever
the
end
result
was,
i
am
speaking
here
to
the
point
of
the
polluted
origin
of
the
legislation
in
the
first
instance.
it
was
at
that
time
that
five
elected
assemblymen
were
prevented
from
being
seated
in
the
new
york
state
legislature
and
a
hearing
of
the
type
which
has
never
before
happen
in
the
state
of
new
york
or
anywhere
else
followed
it.
it
was
in
the
middle
of
this
type
of
hysteria
that
this
enactment
was
passed.
it
was
condemned
by
governor
smith.
it
was
condemned
by
senator
wagner.
it
was
condemned
by
the
progress
of
that
date
but
it
was
enacted
in
the
state
of
hysteria.
in
connection
with
the
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
it
was
signed
by
the
governor.
it
was
after
it
had
this
period
of
hysteria
had
prevailed.
i
may
say
that
we
come
to
the
questions
which
are
raised
here
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
the
4
(e)
and
the
new
york
state
statute
are
intertwined
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
they
are.
it
would
seem
that
the
justification
for
the
passage
of
4
(e)
has
been
because
of
the
discriminatory
character
of
the
legis
--
new
york
state
legislation.
it
would
seem
that
one
of
the
things
which
i
think
has
been
overlooked
is
that
in
somewhere
about
1946
as
a
result
of
a
committee
from
columbia
university,
a
travel
to
puerto
rico
to
examine
the
educational
facilities
there
and
the
results
upon
the
children
of
puerto
rican
schools
and
found
that
our
attempt
to
englishized
had
totally
failed
and
it
was
as
a
result
of
that
was
a
new
method
was
developed
whereby
this
appellee
and
other
children
born
in
puerto
rico
have
no
choice
but
to
read
and
write,
and
learn
american
history
and
civics
through
the
medium
of
spanish.
so
that
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
we
have
--
we
are
a
country
of
two
languages.
we
have
fostered
one
throughout
this
island.
we
have
developed
it
there.
of
the
19
states
which
have
a
literacy
test,
there
are
some
like
the
state
of
louisiana
which
permitted
at
least
in
the
language
of
one's
forebears
in
the
mother
tongue
as
well
as
in
english.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
no.
the
petitioner
was
born,
raised,
and
educated
and
voted
in
puerto
rico
before
coming
to
new
york
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
she
came
about
approximately
1950.
it
was
the
--
at
that
time,
the
committee
from
columbia
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
she
has
not
learned
any
english
since
that
time.
she
has
not
learned
sufficient
to
be
able
to
engage
in
conversation
and
i
may
say
parenthetically
there
are
many
people
who
are
not
capable
of
doing
it
even
though
they're
be
highly
literate
in
another
language.
they
have
blocks
with
respect
to
it
and
it
is
not
on
common
in
a
place
like
new
york
city
where
we
have
three
daily
newspapers
dealing
with
all
problems
of
history,
civics,
and
politics,
where
we
have
radio
stations
and
television
stations
dealing
in
the
spanish
language
that
they
continue
to
do
that.
but
one
other
things
which
i'm
afraid
that
those
of
us
who
are
constantly
confused,
the
puerto
rican
with
every
other
foreigner
who
comes
to
the
shore.
this
man
is
came
as
--
became
a
citizen
by
virtue
of
the
treaty
of
paris
in
1898,
the
jones
act
in
1917,
and
by
further
enactments
of
the
congress
to
the
united
states
which
gave
a
sanction
to
the
constitution
of
puerto
rico.
and
then
in
1947
when
the
united
states
government,
went
before
the
united
nations
and/or
to
establish
our
right,
not
to
make
various
reports
from
time
to
time
under
the
provisions
of
the
colonial
powers,
we
obtained
and
received
permission
from
the
united
nations
to
deal
with
this
into
the
--
provide
dealing
with
that
in
that
fashion.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
no,
it
is
not
sir.
it
is
not
moot
for
the
following
reasons.
i
think
if
the
whole
--
i
do
--
i
contend
that
even
though
that
congress
of
the
united
states
may
have
a
right
to
impose
literary
requirements,
it
may
not
impose
literary
requirements
if
the
purpose
of
that
is
to
deprive
people
from
voting
rather
than
to
create
a
climate
in
which
they
may
vote
intelligently.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
that
only
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
no.
no,
it
will
still
leave
open
the
requirement
with
respect
to
a
certificate
from
a
sixth
grade
school
--
sixth
grade
in
any
school
under
the
american
flag.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
it
will
not
include
puerto
rican
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes.
it
would
include
that
puerto
rican
who
is
involved
here,
but
i
respectfully
submit
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
this,
it's
true.
under
the
--
that's
true.
this
martha
cardona
but
the
next
one
coming
before
this
court
would
not
be
solved.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
that
--
however,
i
may
say
that
i
think
--
i
think
we
should
to
attempt
to
solve
the
cardona
case
first
and
then
proceed
from
that
to
deal
with
the
4
(e)
case
because
on
the
contrary,
i
think
if
the
--
in
order
to
solve
the
--
to
the
case
arising
under
provision
4
(e),
this
court
must
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
new
york
state
law
is
discriminatory.
so,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
you
have
solved
that
problem
in
the
first
instance,
you
may
more
easily
solve
this
--
the
one
which
was
previously
argued.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
you
will
never
--
precisely
judge
brennan.
that's
precisely
the
situation.
if
you
solve
the
problem
arising
here
and
you
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
new
york
statute
is
discriminatory
because
of
the
grandfather
clauses,
the
unusual
exceptions
with
respect
to
it
and
which
have
no
relationship
with
the
quality
of
persons
who
are
preparing
to
vote,
then
by
that
token
that
is
the
end
of
that
problem
not
only
with
respect
to
--
it
is
certainly
is
a
process
in
the
state
of
new
york
is
concern
and
we
--
you
never
need
to
arrive
at
the
other.
i
don't
know
how
this
effect
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
well,
it
will
dispose
of
the
total
because
it
will
have
done
far
deeper.
it
would
seem
to
me
and
i'm
not
going
to
--
i
don't
want
to
prejudice
their
case
presented
here
ahead
of
me,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
from
listening
to
the
argument
that
the
court
must
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
a
basic
reason
for
the
enactment
of
4
(e),
that
there
was
a
reason
based
upon
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
we
present
that
evidence
in
the
first
instance
as
we
have
here,
that
solves
the
problem
--
the
total
problem
and
that
would
be
known
--
well,
perhaps
i
better
not
get
off
into
arguing
the
other
fellow's
case,
but
as
seemingly
in
any
event
it
would
--
it
would
be
a
requirement
that
you
come
to
that
conclusion.
there
is
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes,
it
would
seem
that
way
and
i
may
say
that
it
is
not
so
that
we
are
confined
purely
to
the
--
to
--
we
confine
totally
and
completely
to
the
pronouncements
on
the
day
when
this
was
argued
which
incidentally
was
three
days
after
the
arguments
and
all
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
in
the
cardona
case
and
all
of
the
people
who
did
the
arguing,
both
in
the
house
and
in
the
senate
had
before
them
the
various
information
which
was
available
in
the
case
at
that
time
and
based
their
arguments
on
the
cardona
case,
but
there
was
--
there
were
various
hearings
before
the
congressional
committees
dealing
with
voting
practices
in
the
various
states
previously
and
among
them
was
the
inequities
in
connection
with
the
establishment
of
these
laws.
it
would
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
the
hearings
which
took
place
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
–
not
precisely
at
that
time
judge
brennan
but
took
place
about
two
years
before
that,
had
also
call
into
question
these
very
enactments
not
merely
here,
but
in
other
places
as
well.
now,
we've
had
--
we'd
talked
about
here
of
the
state
of
new
mexico.
i
may
say
in
the
early
stages
of
it,
we
are
--
we're
accustomed
to
dealing
with
spanish,
apparently
it
has
come
up
as
a
problem
somewhat
before
at
the
constitutional
convention
before
that
state
was
admitted
into
statehood.
the
presiding
officer
did
not
know
how
to
speak
english
and
talking
again
with
respect
to
the
possibility
that
new
york
may
have
to
supply
certain
information
in
spanish
to
the
voters
so
that
they
can
properly
understand
the
amendments
and
resolutions
which
appear
in
the
voting
machine,
i
may
say
and
i
have
made
available
to
the
court,
literature
in
which
the
--
the
state
of
new
york
went
out
of
its
way
to
give
all
this
information
in
to
spanish
to
the
perspective
taxpayer.
and
the
--
if
the
--
if
they
can
go
to
the
trouble
of
providing
the
taxpayer
with
instructions
in
spanish
as
to
how
to
fill
out
a
complicated
form,
it's
not
too
much
to
ask
that
perhaps
they
give
some
of
the
instructions
beforehand.
i
may
stay
however
parenthetically,
that
very
few
people
read
the
amendments
or
resolutions
in
the
voting
machine.
if
they're
did,
we
couldn't
possibly
end
our
voting
in
one
day.
everybody
that
votes
on
these
which
are
precious
few
and
make
themselves
acquainted
with
the
provisions
long
beforehand
and
are
in
position
to
deal
intelligently
with
it.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
the
pronouncement
the
--
a
statement
has
been
made
on
the
record
here
that
from
--
on
the
basis
of
the
information
which
is
imparted
to
the
spanish-speaking
community
in
new
york
are
through
the
newspapers,
through
the
magazines,
and
through
the
radio
that
if
they
are
as
intelligent,
the
spanish-speaking
voter
is
just
as
in
--
as
just
enlightened
on
the
issues
as
any
of
the
other
fellow
citizens
who
are
not
spanish-speaking.
and
it
presupposes
too
of
course
during
the
course
of
the
argument
that
everybody
from
all
over
the
state
of
new
york
is
fully
conversing
as
they
go
into
poll
with
respect
to
each
and
every
problem
presented
and
of
course
have
--
where
situation
has
nothing
to
do
with
language.
truth
to
say
we
know
that
this
is
not
quite
so.
this
is
an
area
in
which
these
people
are
as
--
as
has
been
stated
here
a
few
moments
ago
are
inducted
into
the
united
states
army
are
assigned
to
a
regimen
where
spanish
is
spoken
who
go
to
school
and
have
no
choice
with
respect
to
the
language
that
they
are
taught.
this
is
done
not
merely
through
local
taxes,
but
it
is
done
through
federal
grants
and
aid
under
the
sanction
and
under
the
approval
of
the
united
states
and
certainly,
to
have
under
these
circumstances
where
they
come
to
the
--
to
the
mainland,
have
the
state
of
new
york
through
its
invidious
statutes
depriving
of
the
right
to
vote
because
of
the
fact
that
they
were
brought
up
under
circumstances
over
which
they
had
no
control
certainly
requires
that
this
court
take
action
and
strike
it
down.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
that's
right
sir.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
indeed
your
honor.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
that
is
correct.
you're
not
on
--
i
have
presented
here
what
i
regard
arguments
in
the
brief
and
also
presented
on
the
brief
of
the
amicus
curiae
to
the
effect
that
this
--
the
grandfather
provisions
of
the
enactment
itself
are
sufficient
to
permit
this
court
to
strike
it
down
if
for
no
other
reason
dealing
not
merely
with
spanish,
not
with
any
other
language
but
just
on
that
basis
alone.
but
in
addition
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
correct.
it
should
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
if
--
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
follow
you
judge
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
well,
this
is
on
the
more
--
in
the
broader
aspect.
now,
if
they
eliminated
that
i
still
believe
that
under
the
circumstances
here
in
view
of
the
fact
that
a
whole
class
of
american
citizens
who
do
not
knock
at
the
door
from
the
immigrant
ship
who
are
here
by
virtue
of
their
own
inherent
right
as
citizen
for
three
and
four
generations,
that
new
york
state
may
not
make
an
enactment
which
prevents
them
from
exercising
a
rather
sacred
right
and
so,
even
if
you
eliminate
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
it
would
be
solved
insofar
as
this
particular
person
is
concerned
is
true.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
no
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
that
only
a
person
who
can
pass
the
sixth
grade
education
in
spanish.
i
am
talking
--
and
present
a
certificate
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
may
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
would
say
that
new
york
state
insofar
as
a
spanish-speaking
puerto
rican
citizen
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
would
say
that
if
--
that
would
fall
under
the
grandfather
provisions
enacted
in
1922,
that
the
whole
thing
collapses
by
virtue
of
that.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i'm
not
able
to
answer
that
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
--
it's
an
interesting
question
raise
here
somebody
that
went
to
a
foreign
country
when
they
were
a
child
and
came
back.
i
don't
know
whether
a
democracy
we
can
take
care
of
each
in
individual
situation
and
i'm
quite
certain
as
our
laws
are
developed,
we
do
--
do
an
injustice
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
it
would
seem
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
there
are
some
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
--
there
are
many
--
i
assumed.
i
--
i'm
not
wise
enough
to
be
able
to
follow
the
argument
with
that
conclusion,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
logic
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
insofar
as
they're
concern
as
well.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes.
yes,
indeed
to
any
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes,
sir
and
when
we
have
--
when
we
come
to
the
whole
--
we
had
then
--
we
have
to
survey
--
in
the
light
of
this
argument,
we
have
to
survey
whether
or
not
the
literacy
test
really
has
done
what
it
is
set
out
to
do
or
whether
or
not
as
historically
is
the
fact
that
it
was
a
provision
to
prevent
people
from
voting
every
state
where
it
existed
and
that
i
may
say
that
apparently
31
states
have
done
very
well
without
it.
many
of
the
members
of
this
court
have
come
from
states
where
they
don't
have
a
literacy
test
and
it
would
be
invidious
indeed
to
suggest
that
in
these
states
where
there
is
no
literacy
test
the
type
of
legislation,
the
type
of
enactments
that
come
from
it
to
these
circumstances
are
in
theory
to
those
in
areas
where
the
literacy
test
does
in
fact
prevail.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
would
say
that
any
enactment
by
congress
under
those
circumstances
would
be
invalid.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
if
the
state
of
new
york
which
will
enact
--
to
make
some
enactment
which
would
grant
literacy
--
which
would
grant
voting
rights
to
a
citizen
and
congress
were
to
take
that
right
away
by
its
enactment,
i
think
that
enactment
should
be
--
should
be
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
because
judge
black
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
because
judge
black,
i
would
regard
the
grabble
of
the
complaint
to
be
taking
rights
away
and
that's
what
new
york
state
would
not
have
done
under
the
proposal
which
you
have
suggested.
whereas
on
the
contrary,
congress
would
be
taking
away
something
that
a
state
had
enacted
and
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
right.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
yes.
i
would
say
that
if
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
would
say,
that
unless
there
is
--
i
do
not
contend
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
do
not
contend
here
that
the
states
do
not
have
a
right
to
setup
reasonable
requirements
with
respect
to
voting.
i
do
say
that
every
place
they
have
done
it,
it
has
been
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
people
from
voting
and
therefore
this
court
should
look
with
more
scrutiny
into
each
one
--
particularly,
one
such
as
we
are
here
--
we
have
here
under
consideration.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
would
say
that
congress
at
that
point
if
the
state
of
new
york
extend
its
power
to
those
to
--
to
vote
and
that
congress
took
that
power
away
that
such
an
act
would
be
unconstitutional
because
they
would
have
been
taking
away
a
right
from
the
citizen
that
it
had
acquired
under
the
state.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
under
the
state
--
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
i
would
say
that
the
state
is
supreme
provided
that
it
is
not
done
for
the
purpose
and
it
does
not
interfere
with
--
as
it
does
here,
rights
which
had
been
acquired
by
the
treaty
of
paris,
by
enactments
of
congress,
by
proposal
submitted
to
the
united
nations
which
makes
this
a
unique
and
different
situation
and
i
would
say
that
congress
--
that
the
state
would
be
supreme
with
the
development
of
its
voting
rights
provided
however,
that
it
did
not
interfere
with
the
basic
constitutional
rights
of
any
citizens
such
as
in
--
judge
black,
you
asked
whether
or
not
there
was
any
proposal
here
--
there
was
any
suggestion
that
this
was
violative
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
we
make
--
we
claim
that
it
is,
not
under
the
colored
provisions
but
under
the
race
provision.
it
is
our
suggestion
here
that
puerto
ricans
in
the
sense
are
a
race
and
a
race
that
are
here
in
the
sense
that
they
have
a
language.
they
have
a
common
tradition.
they
have
a
common
purpose
for
over
300
years
in
their
island
home
and
it
is
our
suggestion
here
that
when
any
law,
even
though
it
may
not
have
interfered
with
them
at
the
time
of
its
enactment,
if
later,
it
did
actually
interfere
with
their
rights
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
that
it
should
be
stricken
down.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
any
country
--
american
citizens
in
any
country,
i
would
--
well,
i'm
not
prepared
to
argue
that.
it
would
seem
logically
to
me
that
if
american
citizen
for
some
reason
or
another
found
himself
in
another
country
and
was
brought
up
and
had
to
learn
his
language
--
some
other
language
that
under
these
circumstances
i
suppose
it
would
be
logical
to
follow
through
and
suggest
that
the
law
would
be
unconstitutional
as
to
such
person.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
may
i
just
for
a
moment.
mr.
paul
o'dwyer
your
honors
that
i
think
that
the
burden
placed
upon
this
court
in
dealing
with
the
4
(e)
matter
has
been
considerably
lightened
by
consideration
of
the
facts
outlined
in
the
cardona
case
which
have
not
been
questioned.
all
of
the
allegations
contained
in
the
record
are
without
contradiction.
in
so
consequently
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
point
where
you
feel
that
congress
is
justified
in
the
enactment
of
4
(e)
having
first
from
to
the
conclusion
that
by
virtue
of
the
grandfather
clause
and
the
other
provisions
and
the
other
arguments
which
are
made
that
the
law
is
unconstitutional
in
the
first
--
in
the
first
place
then
this
presents
a
basis
for
the
--
for
the
establishment
of
the
4
(e)
if
the
law
at
the
present
time.
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
they
are
intertwined
to
the
point
for
a
consideration
of
the
first
case
must
come
after
a
full
and
complete
consideration
of
the
cardona
case.
thank
you.
