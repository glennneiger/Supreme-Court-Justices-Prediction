justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
children?
is
it
the
plaintiff
here
--
petitioner
a
child?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
did
she
come
to
new
york?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
she
not
learned
any
english
since
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you.
suppose
the
situation,
legal
situation
here
were
reversed
as
between
the
state
and
the
nation,
suppose
that
new
york
had
authorized
these
particular
people
to
vote
under
this
conditions,
congress
came
along
and
says
well
they
couldn't,
which
would
be
supreme?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
--
on
what
credentials
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
congress
has
the
supreme
power
to
pass
legislation
in
that
field,
why
could
it
not
do
so
even
if
the
situation
were
reversed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
power
is
in
congress
to
pick
the
qualification
to
voters
in
this
respect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
saying
--
are
you
saying
--
i'm
just
asking
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
they
thought
that
it
could
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
this
argument
that's
going
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
the
congress
that
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
vote
without
qualification
with
reference
to
literature?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
knowledge
of
the
english
language?
justice
hugo
l.
black
federal
constitution
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
unless
it
is
undoubtedly
as
to
keep
them
from
voting
when
you
say
you
can't
vote
it
--
you
up
over
unless
you
are
21
or
reduce
it
to
18
and
nearly
all
these
things
are
to
prevent
people
from
voting
unless
it
meets
some
qualification.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
state
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
state
supreme
in
that
field?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
let's
get
back
to
the
questions
that
justice
stewart
asked
a
while
ago.
you
would
say
they
can't
do
that
with
reference
to
any
people
from
many
countries?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
new
york
law
is
in
conflict
with
4
(e)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
--
supposed
that
law
is
valid
that
the
federal
statute,
why
isn't
your
law
in
conflict
with
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you're
saying
that
you're
challenging
that
are
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
section
5
does
give
power
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
–
congress
should
do
this.
where
--
does
your
law
conflict
with
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
be
the
supreme
law
of
the
land,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it's
valid,
it
would
be
the
supreme
law,
would
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
arguing
that
it
is
invalid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
suppose
it
has
--
that
that's
what
i
want
to
get
it
so
i'm
not
interested
in
that
part
of
the
argument.
suppose
if
they
do
have
the
power
to
enact
it
under
section
5,
if
they
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
–
it
is
necessary
to
do
that
to
protect
people
against
discrimination
in
voting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
and
there's
any
rational
ground
that
anybody
could
think
about,
or
conceive
of
to
say
that
congress
had
the
right
to
do
that,
what
about
it
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
protection
from
discrimination.
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
suppose
if
there's
reasonable
ground
for
congress
to
believe
that,
why
a
separate
language
you
want
to
use
or
other
language
than
you
use
--
if
it's
not
wholly
irrational
for
them
to
say
that
they
need
protection
from
discrimination
if
this
would
result
in
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
–
how
wouldn't
the
law
be
valid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying,
if
congress
has
to
make
--
has
to
produce
evidence
to
show
that
had
a
--
that
it
had
a
right
to
believe,
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
have
found
the
--
enforced
by
appropriate
legislation,
the
provision
to
this
section.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
who
would
have
show
it?
does
congress
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
have
to
produce
evidence
to
show
that
it
has
grounds
to
believe
that
the
law
ought
to
be
passed
or
is
it
--
very
heavy
burden
on
the
people
who
attack
its
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
all
that
it
had
no
ground.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
could
step
in,
in
many
fields
where
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
has
power
to
enact
legislation
in
that
field
without
having
in
a
burden
put
on
the
congress
to
show
that
it
had
a
right
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
most
congress
believed
that
there
was
enough
probability
of
it
that
it
is
necessary
in
the
public
interest
to
protect
against
discrimination
on
account
of
race
or
color
or
what
not,
why
wouldn't
have
a
right
to
do
it
under
section
5?
it
is
the
burden
on
the
congress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
the
government
to
show
that
it
had
grounds
for
it
or
put
on
the
people
who
attack
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
suggest
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you?
justice
hugo
l.

you
said
children?
is
it
