i
dislike
interrupting
the
order
of
your
argument
but
i
like
to
get
back
to
this
question
of
whether
your
case
is
moot,
if
we
should
sustain
the
4
(e)
in
the
previous
case.
now
in
order
to
rule
--
to
make
a
ruling
that
will
give
relief
to
the
plaintiff
in
which
whom
you
represent,
we
would
have
to
go
farther
wouldn't
we
than
merely
to
say
that
the
in
fact
that
new
york
has
to
accept
sixth
grade
education
in
the
spanish
language,
but
have
to
go
beyond
that
and
say
that
and
hold
involved
that
new
york
has
to
give
an
examination
or
literacy
test
in
spanish
as
well
as
in
english
where
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
person
concern
speaks
of
a
spanish.
the
reason
for
that
being
your
complaint
has
not
state
that
you're
seeking
relief
on
behalf
of
somebody
who
has
a
sixth
grade
education
in
the
puerto
rican
schools.
justice
abe
fortas
so
we
would
have
to
go
further
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
than
we
have
to
go
in
the
previous
case
under
4
(e)
which
involves
--
which
raises
only
the
question
of
the
sixth
grade
education.
