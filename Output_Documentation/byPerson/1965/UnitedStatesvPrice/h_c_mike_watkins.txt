mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
half
of
the
appellees
directing
our
remarks
furnished
to
the
matter
of
jurisdiction
in
case
number
59
as
stated
in
our
brief.
we
believe
certainly
that
this
honorable
court
has
jurisdiction
to
review
on
direct
appeal
case
number
59.
the
district
court
in
regard
to
case
59
in
dismissing
the
indictment,
holding
that
it
did
not
state
the
cause
of
action
against
the
united
states,
as
the
charge
was
made
on
the
241
restricted
in
his
opinion
that
241
reached
interferences
with
the
rights
and
privileges
of
the
citizen
in
relation
to
the
federal
government,
rights
and
privileges
arising
from
the
substantive
powers
of
the
federal
government.
in
case
number
60,
it
already
stated,
the
indictment
stands
as
against
the
officers
--
the
three
officers
in
that
case.
the
indictment
also
stands
in
count
one
against
the
all
of
the
defendants
as
the
charge
was
in
violation
of
371,
title
18
of
the
united
states
code.
the
statutes,
if
it
pleases
the
court,
were
before
the
district
court
as
we
understand
it,
was
241,
371,
and
242.
no
indictment
in
either
case
made
in
reference
to
section
2,
title
18
of
the
united
states
code
having
to
do
with
the
aiding
or
abetting
statute.
our
proposition
then
on
behalf
of
the
appellees
is
that
section
241
of
the
criminal
code
does
not
reach
interferences
with
the
exercise
of
natural
rights
of
the
citizen
or
the
inhabitant,
and
such
interferences
are
not
encompassed
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
certainly,
equality
and
equal
protection
under
the
law
is
a
right
and
privilege
of
every
american
citizen
and
all
inhabitants.
and
it
stands
without
debate
that
it
is
the
duty
of
every
republican
government
to
protect
that
equality
and
right
under
the
law
of
every
citizen
and
every
inhabitant
of
this
--
our
great
country.
but
as
it
has
to
do
with
harm
or
injury
by
one
citizen
as
against
another
citizen
in
regard
to
his
natural
rights,
we
respectfully
submit
that
punishment
for
that
type
of
alone
is
reserved
to
the
respective
states
under
the
tenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
the
fourteenth
amendment
guarantee
is
a
guarantee
against
encroachment
of
the
individual
rights
in
regard
to
encroachment
by
the
state.
242
certainly
reflects
the
power
of
the
congress
to
pass
laws
to
enforce
any
encroachment
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
guarantee,
and
they
did
that
in
passing
section
242,
the
color
of
law
statute.
therefore,
generally
our
contention
is
that
241
reaches
interferences
with
the
exercise
of
those
rights
and
privileges
arising
from
the
substantive
powers
of
the
federal
government.
those
rights
and
privileges
arising
because
of
the
relationship
of
the
victim
and
the
federal
government
and
not
the
general
guarantee
of
the
due
process
clause
and
equal
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
encompassed
by
242
as
action
of
the
state.
we
feel
that
the
cases
of
logan,
yarbrough,
william
and
classic,
saylor,
waddell,
quarles
and
others
cited
in
the
brief,
support
that
position.
let's
make
reference
a
moment
to
the
statute
242
and
241
in
regard
to
the
differences
in
those
two
statutes.
241
create
a
misdemeanor.
it
speaks
of
color
of
law
directing
its
meaning
directly
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
having
to
do
with
the
guarantee
against
encroachment
by
the
state.
it
speaks
of
color
or
race
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
yes
mr.
justice,
242.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
excuse
me,
i'm
referring
to
242.
it
creates
a
misdemeanor.
it
speaks
of
color
of
law.
it
has
to
do
with
color
or
race.
it
has
to
do
with
the
inhabitants
in
addition
to
the
citizen.
it
punishes
criminal
acts,
not
conspiracies
--
241
has
to
do
with
conspiracy
only,
not
substantive
criminal
acts.
it
has
to
do
with
the
felony,
wherein
242
has
to
do
with
a
misdemeanor.
it
makes
no
reference
whatsoever
to
color
of
law
as
does
242.
it
deals
with
the
rights
of
citizens
and
it
creates
an
independent
crime
going
on
the
highway
to
do
the
wrongful
acts
stated
therein.
therefore,
as
to
the
language
of
the
indictment
in
number
59,
when
that
language
speaks
of
color
of
law
--
color
of
law
is
referred
to
both
indictments,
in
number
59
and
in
60,
but
when
its
used
in
number
59,
that
language
alone,
we
contend
respectfully,
cannot
extend
241
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
again,
cannot
make
a
misdemeanor
or
felony
by
simply
using
the
terminology
on
the
--
these
things
were
done
on
the
color
of
law,
when
it's
drawn
under
241.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
mr.
justice
i
did
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
yes,
mr.
justice.
241
is
a
felony
and
24
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
yes
sir,
it
was.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
242
stands
as
against
the
officers
and
the
charge
of
the
general
conspiracy
and
under
371
now
stands
against
all
the
officers
and
the
private
individuals,
if
your
honor
please,
at
this
time.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
we
contend
in
number
60
if
your
honor
please
that
the
theory
of
dismissal
of
242
as
against
the
private
individuals
as
we
understand
the
court's
ruling
had
to
do
with
the
matter
of
fact
and
that
the
indictment
did
not
charge
anything
that
they
did
in
fact,
or
did
not
make
them
in
fact
or
de
facto
acting
under
color
of
law
and
that
they
did
not
flash
a
badge
as
in
williams
versus
united
states
or
did
not
represent
themselves
to
be
officers
of
the
law.
we
understand
that
to
be
the
reason
for
the
dismissal
of
the
private
individuals
under
242.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
mr.
justice,
if
the
indictment
had
specifically
allege
that
the
private
individuals
were
aiding
and
abetting
and
had
directly
brought
section
2,
title
18
u.s.c.
before
the
federal
district
court,
is
my
honest
opinion,
at
that
indictment
in
regard
to
the
aiding
and
abetting
statute
would
have
stood.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
mr.
justice,
i
feel
like
that
the
district
court
could
not
assume
the
position
of
prosecuted
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
department
to
direct
the
violations
as
going
against
section
2,
title
18,
the
aiding
and
abetting
statute.
if
the
justice
department
intended
that
that
statute
be
used,
it
should
have
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court,
it's
our
position
in
that
regard
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
mr.
justice,
we
feel
like
that
any
indictment
sense,
it
referred
that
these
violations
are
in
violation
of
242,
241
and
371
that
that
same
allegation
should
have
been
made
in
regard
to
section
2
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
in
the
indictment.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
as
the
plan
and
purpose,
mr.
justice,
that
indictment
in
number
59
and
the
other
indictment
for
that
matter
went
on
to
say
that
as
a
matter
of
plan
and
purpose
that
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
law
enforcement
officers
that
these
main
victims
be
released
and
that
they
be
intercepted
after
their
release
and
that
assault
and
battery
and
murder
be
committed.
that
was
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
all
the
defendants
name
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
yes
sir.
it
is
crystal
clear
to
us
that
section
242
encompasses
fourteenth
amendment
rights
and
that
certainly,
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
congress
to
reach
actions
on
the
color
of
law
under
242
--
242
along
with
371,
371
making
the
private
individuals
vulnerable
to
prosecution
as
they
act
with
law
enforcement
officers
under
the
general
conspiracy
statute.
then
our
contention
is
that
without
overlapping,
241
should
be
restrictive
to
federal-type
rights.
it
is
our
position
that
in
effect,
the
contention
of
the
government
here
is
that
241
should
reach
rights
or
interferences
with
the
right
to
be
free
of
assault
and
murder,
if
it
not
be
restricted.
surely,
it
would
be
conceded
in
cases
like
yarbrough,
logan,
quarles
and
others
that
this
honorable
court
emphasized,
federal
type
rights
or
relationship
of
the
victim
and
the
federal
government.
no
state
action
was
involved
in
those
cases.
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights,
we
contend
that
only
state
action
can
deprive
a
citizen
or
inhabitant
our
fourteenth
amendment
rights
as
the
fourteenth
amendment
read.
let's
take
for
instance
about
our
racial
school
system.
the
private
individual
not
acting
under
color
of
law
has
no
duty
to
furnish
a
non-discriminatory
education
to
others
but
the
state
has
that
duty
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
--
equal
protection
clause,
in
reference
thereto
to
furnish
nondiscriminatory
education.
in
the
wheeler
case,
the
right
then
involved
was
to
move
from
place
to
place,
ingress
and
egress
therefrom.
the
principle
of
241
was
not
extended
because
it
had
to
do
with
a
natural
right.
in
the
hodges
case
was
a
conspiracy
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
a
natural
right.
the
right
not
dependent
upon
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
the
natural
right
of
man
that
is
being
endowed
by
his
creator
and
doesn't
depend
upon
the
government.
that
right
to
be
free
of
assault
and
battery,
free
of
false
imprisonment
and
murdered
--
a
natural
right.
in
the
hodges
case
was
a
conspiracy
to
prevent
citizens
from
disposing
of
their
labor
as
they
sought
it
on
the
labor
contracts.
the
right
to
work
is
not
dependent
upon
the
constitution
and
241
was
not
--
the
principle
of
241
was
not
extended
in
that
case.
in
the
yarbrough
case
was
a
habeas
corpus
case,
a
charge
in
regard
to
intimidation
of
citizens
relative
to
the
right
to
vote
for
federal
officers.
section
241
was
extended,
it
reached
that
type
of
interference
because
it's
an
interference
with
the
right
arising
based
upon
the
substantive
powers
of
the
federal
government.
the
court
in
effect
held
that
in
that
case
that
the
right
to
vote
was
of
such
supreme
importance,
that
it
was
necessary
to
the
governmental
function
that
it
was
of
such
importance
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
passed
and
guaranteed
that
there
would
be
no
encroachment
by
the
state
or
by
the
federal
government
against
that
right
to
vote.
in
the
yarbrough
case
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
mr.
justice,
the
right
to
vote
for
a
congressman
arises
on
the
article
1
section
2
and
4
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
inherent
make
up
of
the
government
under
the
constitution
gives
the
citizen
the
right
to
vote
without
regard,
we
respectfully
submit,
to
the
fifteenth
amendment.
the
fifteenth
amendment,
as
the
fourteenth
was
a
guarantee
that
there
would
be
no
encroachment
by
the
state
or
the
federal
government
on
that
right
to
vote,
such
as
the
case's
holding
that
the
respective
state
has
the
right
to
set
the
standard
of
voting,
but
if
that
standard
through
color
of
law
be
repugnant
to
the
fifteenth
amendment,
it
will
be
stricken
down.
in
the
yarbrough
case,
and
with
permission
--
a
quote
from
the
yarbrough
case,
in
reference
to
cases
in
this
court
in
which
the
power
of
congress
under
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
been
held
to
relate
alone
to
acts
done
on
the
state
authority,
can
afford
petitioners
no
way
in
the
present
case,
but
while
it
may
be
true
that
acts
which
are
a
mere
invasions
of
private
rights
which
are
not
committed
by
anyone
exercising
state
authority,
are
not
within
the
scope
of
that
amendment,
it
is
quite
a
different
matter
when
the
congress
undertakes
to
protect
the
citizen
in
the
exercise
of
rights
conferred
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
essential
to
the
healthy
organization
of
the
government
itself,
and
the
habeas
corpus
writ
was
denied.
thus,
the
extension
of
the
protection
of
241
in
the
voting
right
cases
rest
on
the
fifteenth
amendment,
we
contend
that
it
does
not
as
perhaps
no
difference
in
the
guarantee
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
that
it
guarantees
there
will
be
no
encroachment
by
the
state
and
same
language
in
the
fifteenth
including
the
state
and
the
federal
government.
we
contend
that
the
right
to
vote
arises
from
other
sections
of
the
constitution.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
article
1,
the
inherent
makeup
of
the
government
as
set
out
by
article
1,
section
2
and
4.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
your
honor,
we
contend
that
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
we
contend
that
those
rights
arising
from
the
exercise
of
the
substantive
powers
of
the
government,
whatever
they
may
be
is
reached
by
241
and
its
therefore
be
restricted
to
those
rights
and
privileges
arising
from
the
exercise
of
the
substantive
powers
of
the
government
or
the
relationship
of
the
victim
and
his
government
whatever
federal
type
right
that
might
be
is
reached
by
241
such
as
taking
in
a
prisoner
from
the
custody
of
the
united
states
marshal,
the
right
to
vote,
the
right
to
homestead
land,
any
other
right
arising
because
of
the
substantive
powers
of
the
federal
government
to
that
individual
and
his
relationship.
and
that
is
without
regard
to
any
particular
section,
as
we
understand
it
mr.
justice.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
mr.
justice,
we
feel
like
that
the
decision
as
cited
in
the
appellee's
brief
leading
up
to
the
united
states
versus
williams
reflects
that
the
court
from
time
to
time
sought
to
restrict
241
without
regard
to
what
the
particular
right
might
be
to
those
rights
and
privileges
arising
from
the
substantive
power
of
the
federal
government.
and
in
that
regard,
we
do
feel
like
that
the
case
is
leading
out
to
united
states
versus
williams
brought
--
followed
that
theory.yes
sir?
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
in
the
hodges
case
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
there
was
a
charge
under
5508,
which
is
the
same
as
241
now,
in
regard
to
intimidations
relative
to
the
right
to
work.
the
court
in
effect
held
in
that
case
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
were
restricted
to
state
action
and
that
there
was
no
state
action
involved
in
regard
to
the
right
to
work.
it
was
a
natural
right
and
was
protected
by
the
laws
of
the
respective
states.
in
the
quarles
case,
it
had
to
do
with
the
right
of
one
citizen
to
inform
on
another
citizen
concerning
the
violation
of
internal
revenue
code,
in
regard
to
a
distillery.
and
the
court
held
that
that
right,
the
right
to
inform
was
a
constitutional
right
necessary
for
the
enforcement
of
the
substantive
powers
of
the
federal
government,
and
that
principle
of
241
should
reach
that
type
of
circumstance
and
be
protected.
and
quoting
from
that
case
such
rights,
“arises
out
of
the
creation
and
establishment
by
the
constitution
itself
of
a
national
government,
paramount
and
supreme
within
its
sphere
of
action,”
and
citing
the
logan
case
also.
in
the
logan
case
as
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
a
prisoner
was
in
custody
of
a
united
states
marshal,
and
the
main
defendants
allegedly
took
the
prisoner
from
the
custody
of
the
united
states
marshal
and
committed
wrong
against
this
person.
the
court
in
effect
held
there
that
it
was
interference,
a
direct
interference
with
the
substantive
powers
of
the
federal
government
to
protect
a
prisoner
in
federal
custody.
the
waddell
case
as
mentioned
in
the
initial
argument
by
the
government
has
to
do
with
a
right
of
homesteading
land.
and
it
might
be
said
in
that
case
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
land
is
being
homesteaded
by
a
citizen
or
inhabitant.
the
principle
there
sought
to
be
at
best
in
regard
to
protection
afforded
by
241
was
that
the
protection
of
the
title
was
wholly
dependant
upon
a
federal
act,
the
homestead
act,
those
--
the
exercise
of
those
rights
and
privileges
arising
from
the
substantive
powers
of
the
federal
government.
what
are
the
substantive
powers
of
the
federal
government?
we
contend
that
they
are
those
powers
necessary
for
the
completion
of
the
meaning
and
purpose
of
the
constitution
whether
it
would
be
expressed
by
some
particular
section
of
the
inferred
rights
arising
there
from
as
stated
by
the
earlier
cases,
the
right
to
vote,
the
right
to
protection
and
the
custody
of
a
u.s.
marshal
and
so
on,
the
freedom
from
self-incrimination,
double
jeopardy
and
so
on
--
and
yes,
due
process
as
to
the
guarantee
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
against
encroachment
by
the
state.
on
page
seven
of
the
government's
brief,
it
is
contented
and
they
say
due
process
rights
have
been
made
definite
by
decisions
of
this
honorable
court
and
they
cite
the
screws
case
and
united
states
versus
williams,
and
certainly
due
process
in
regard
to
those
cases
were
made
definite
but
we
respect
to
point
out
that
those
cases
had
to
do
with
242
and
371.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
screws
case,
there
was
an
original
charge
in
that
case
under
241
as
in
the
case
at
bar,
241
was
dismissed
in
the
screws
case
in
the
lower
court
and
the
government
abandonment
in
regard
to
the
appeal.
and
when
it
reached
the
higher
court,
the
sections
242
and
371
were
involved
in
that
case.on
page
9
of
the
government's
brief,
it's
contended
that
--
and
the
question
is
asked,
“does
241
to
reached
invasion
of
rights
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment?”
actually,
we
could
say
that,
on
account
of
an
individual
if
he
does
not
act
under
color
of
law
invade
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
the
protection
we
contend
extended
by
241,
that
is
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
fifteenth
amendment
are
not
exponents
of
241
as
such.
on
page
10
of
the
brief,
the
government
contends
that
241
reaches
the
fourteenth
amendment
guaranteed
or
that
the
rights
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
comes
within
241
because
of
the
language
of
the
statute,
its
text
and
context
and
its
legislative
history.
and
then
in
the
government's
brief
as
stated
in
the
appendix,
the
entire
speech
made
by
senator
pool
is
there
printed.
we
respectively
call
the
court's
attention
to
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
regard
to
the
legislative
history
of
241
in
united
states
versus
williams
and
we
asked
permission
to
read
a
short
quotation
from
that
case.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said,
“we
based
our
decision
on
the
history
of
241.”
they
talked
about
the
history,
that's
the
history
he
based
it
on.
“we
based
our
decision
on
the
history
of
241,
its
text
and
context,
the
statutory
framework
in
which
it
stands,
its
practical
and
judicial
application—controlling
elements
in
construing
a
federal
criminal
provision
that
affects
the
wise
adjustment
between
state
responsibility
and
national
control
of
essentially
local
affairs.
the
elements
all
converge
in
one
direction.
that
lead
us
to
hold
that
section
241
only
covers
conduct
which
interferes
with
rights
arising
from
the
substantive
powers
of
the
federal
government.”
we
respectfully
submit
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
considered
the
legislative
history
when
he
made
that
statement.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
mr.
justice,
please
sir,
in
a
case
referred
to
earlier,
they
had
the
right
to
do
with
ingress
and
egress
and
the
move
from
place
to
place.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
move
from
place
to
place,
as
long
as
there
is
not
some
interference
with
the
interstate
commerce
would
be
also
a
natural
right
of
every
individual.
and
that
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
whether
it
would
be
an
interference
with
the
substantive
powers
of
the
federal
government
in
regard
to
the
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce,
i
would
feel
like
it
would
depend
upon
the
charge
in
the
indictment
to
some
extent,
but
as
long
as
it
would
have
to
do
with
moving
from
place
to
place
as
the
right
of
every
individual,
that
it
would
a
natural
right,
and
the
principle
of
241
would
not
extend
to
it.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
yes.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
well,
we
have
one
case
cited
in
the
appellees'
brief
wherein
it
has
to
do
with
a
treaty
of
china
wherein
the
certain
persons
named
therein
were
charged
with
the
intimidation
of
certain
chinese
people
trying
to
make
them
move
from
a
certain
locality
of
a
state
and
to
move
out
and
vice
versa.
and
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
the
principle
of
241
did
not
extend
in
that
instance.
if
we
could
relate
it,
the
hypothetical
more
closely
to
interstate
commerce
powers,
if
it
was
an
interference
of
the
substantive
rights
of
the
federal
government
in
regard
to
the
function
of
the
interstate
commerce,
and
the
facts
were
so
alleged
in
an
indictment,
i
have
no
doubt
of
what
241
--
the
principle
of
241
would
reach
any
conduct
that
was
charged
in
the
indictment
in
such
a
manner
as
it
would
have
to
do
with
the
interference
of
rights
or
privileges
arising
from
the
substantive
powers
of
the
federal
government
whether
it
would
be
interstate
commerce
or
any
other
based
on
federal
government
power.
it
is
the
best
i
can
answer
that
question.
on
page
13
of
the
government's
brief,
they
contend
--
the
government
contends
that
the
courts
prior
to
the
williams
case
taken
for
granted
that
241
covered
fourteenth
amendment
rights
and
the
reason
is
brought
forward
there
that
it
was
assumed
that
the
courts
prior
to
williams
presumed
that
it
reached
the
fourteenth
amendment
guarantee
and
that
the
courts
would
determine
that
the
conduct
charged
did
not
come
within
the
guarantee
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
respectfully
submit
that
whether
241
be
restricted
to
federal
type
rights,
or
whether
we
say
that
the
conduct
charge
does
not
come
within
the
protected
guarantee
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
exactly
the
same
result
whether
the
conduct
charged
comes
within
the
guarantee
of
whether
the
241
be
restricted,
amounts
to
the
same
thing.
if
241
is
unrestricted,
we
feel
like
in
effect,
it
would
amount
to
an
amendment
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
extending
241.
in
that
regard,
we
feel
like
that
in
effect,
it
would
amount
to
the
samething
as
adding
the
word
“person”
in
the
amendment.
in
the
appellees'
brief
on
page
3,
the
fourteenth
amendment
first
section
is
cited.
and
with
permission,
we
read
to
make
our
analogy.
“no
state
shall
make
or
enforce
any
law
which
shall
abridge
the
privileges
or
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states;
nor
shall
any
state
deprive
any
person
of
life,
liberty,
or
property,
without
due
process
of
law;
nor
deny
to
any
person
within
its
jurisdiction
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.”
if
we
do
not
restrict
241
and
extend
it
to
protect
the
guarantee,
it
would
in
effect
change
it
to
this
effect
--
no
state
shall
make
or
enforce
any
law
which
shall
abridge
the
privileges
or
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states;
nor
shall
any
state
or
person
deprive
any
other
person
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
we
respectfully
submit
that
in
regard
to
242
and
371
which
reaches
private
individuals
whether
they
act
with
officers
or
not
in
violation
of
242,
that
the
answer
is
if
the
penalty
is
not
great
enough
in
242
or
371
rather
than
to
try
to
reach
a
felony
in
section
241,
that
the
answer
is
an
amendment
in
regard
to
the
penalty
of
242
and
371
making
felonies
of
those
sections
rather
than
to
extend
241
and
try
to
make
it
reach
the
fourteenth
amendment
guarantee.
whether
it
would
be
the
obligation
of
a
nation,
state,
or
an
individual,
perhaps
a
simple
analogy
could
be
used
here.
for
argument's
sake,
let's
say
that
a,
b,
or
c
are
guaranteed
to
protect
him
from
b.
but
d
comes
in
and
harms
c.
it's
obvious
that
it
does
not
come
within
the
guarantee.
the
guarantee
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
that
the
state
b
will
not
encroach
upon
the
right
of
the
individual
in
regard
to
equal
protection
of
the
law
and
due
process
of
law.
but
whether
or
not
the
conduct
charged
in
the
indictment
comes
within
the
guarantee
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
whether
it
restrict
241
to
federal
type
rights,
in
result,
it's
exactly
the
same.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
oh
no
sir.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
congress
certainly
had
a
power
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
we
say
that
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
oh
no
sir.
your
honor,
we
intended
to
leave
the
impression
that
congress
certainly
had
the
power
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
any
other
amendment
and
that
they
did
exactly
that
in
passing
to
242.
but
that
they
had
something
else
in
mind
in
passing
241,
that
is
a
restriction
of
241,
in
regard
to
the
rights
that
has
been
held
by
the
cases
heretofore
that
it
protects
those
rights
arising
from
the
substantive
power
of
the
federal
government.
certainly,
we
do
not
contend
that
241
is
not
that
it's
because
of
vagueness
or
otherwise
and
that
241
does
not
serve
a
good
purpose.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
well
yes
--
mr.
justice,
senator
pool
in
the
argument
that
the
government
referred
that
he
made
at
that
time
these
sections
were
being
passed
argued
at
that
point
that
all
crimes
committed
--
that
occurred
while
this
under
color
of
law
wrong
was
being
done
should
be
prosecuted
directly
by
the
federal
courts.
but
the
congress
at
that
time
did
not
see
fit
to
extend
that
principle.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
whether
the
congress
has
a
right
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
--
or
the
power
to
pass
a
law
and
would
enable
federal
courts
to
prosecute
any
crime
that
was
committed
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
but,
your
honor
please,
the
best
way
that
i
could
answer
that
is
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
the
best
way
i
could
answer
that
is
that
since
it's
not
numerated
as
being
a
federal
power
that
the
congress
would
have
the
power
to
pass
any
law
that
they
saw
fit
in
regard
to
any
crime
being
prosecuted
whether
or
not
at
that
time
it
would
be
construed
by
the
courts
to
be
an
extension
of
the
power
in
regard
to
the
reservation
to
the
respective
states
under
the
tenth
amendment,
i
do
not
know
that.
but
i
do
feel
like
that
congress
would
have
the
power
to
pass
any
law
they
felt
necessary
in
regard
to
the
protections
of
the
guarantees
upon
any
of
the
amendments.
and
also
prosecute
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
--
the
crimes
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
your
honor,
we
feel
like
the
congress
to
have
the
power
to
pass
the
law.
we
feel
like
the
courts
would
hold
it
invalid
and
that
it
had
to
do
with
the
natural
right
rather
than
those
rights
arising
from
the
substantive
power
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
whether
the
congress
has
the
constitutional
power
to
pass
a
law
stating
that
murder
as
such
or
theft
as
such
would
be
prosecuted
by
the
federal
courts,
we
do
not
feel
that
the
exercise
of
that
power
would
be
valid,
no
sir.
that's
my
opinion.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
mr.
chief
justice,
i
intended
to
state
that
the
jurisdiction
of
this
honorable
court
to
review
the
case,
in
number
59,
was
conceded
by
the
appellees
that
certainly
this
honorable
court
has
jurisdiction
in
case
number
59.
we
do
contend
and
we're
about
to
make
that
point
your
honor
that
as
to
case
number
60,
we
do
not
feel
that
this
honorable
court
should
take
jurisdiction
of
case
number
60
on
direct
appeal,
but
certainly
in
case
number
59,
there's
no
question
about
this
honorable
court
having
jurisdiction
of
the
review
in
case
number
59.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
under
241.
and
number
59
has
to
do
with
241.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
and
number
60
has
to
do
with
242.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
and
regard
to
number
60,
and
that
being
the
point,
there
is
a
contention
of
the
appellees
that
it
was
in
the
mind
of
the
federal
district
judge
that
the
allegation
from
a
factual
standpoint
in
number
60
under
242
did
not
bring
a
private
individual
to
property
within
the
indictment
and
that
they
had
before
simply
a
matter
of
fact
that
if
the
district
attorney
had
charged
that
they
flashed
a
badge
or
did
some
other
thing
or
even
the
aiding
or
abetting
statute,
they
would
have
brought
them
within
the
242,
then
of
course
that
indictment
could
have
stood
and
we
feel
like
that
was
the
thinking
of
the
federal
district
judge
at
the
time
when
he
says
that
there
was
nothing
alleged
to
make
the
private
individuals
in
fact,
or
de
facto
acting
under
color
of
law.
then,
the
government
contends
here
that
the
because
of
the
aiding
and
abetting
statute
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
indictment
did
not
refer
to
the
aiding
and
abetting
statute
that
the
indictment
on
number
60
as
against
the
private
individual
should've
been
allowed
to
stand.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
district
court
was
dealing
simply
with
the
interpretation
of
the
indictment
and
not
a
construction
of
the
statute
in
that
regard
and
if
the
district
court
was
bidding
with
an
interpretation
of
the
indictment
that
on
direct
appeal,
it
is
not
been
properly
before
the
court
in
case
number
60,
and
that
the
court
should
not
take
jurisdiction
of
the
case
in
number
60.
in
our
minds,
it's
crystal
clear
that
section
242
clearly
reaches
the
fourteenth
amendment
guarantee
having
to
do
with
action
under
color
of
law.
and
that
coupled
with
of
371
which
makes
the
private
individual
vulnerable
to
the
prosecution
under
general
conspiracy
to
violate
242,
and
that
without
any
overlapping,
certainly,
we
feel
that
it
was
not
the
intention
of
the
congress
that
241
and
242
deal
with
the
exact
same
violation
and
that
personally
prosecuted
twice
for
the
exact
same
thing
which
is
protected
in
regard
to
the
fifth
amendment.
but
without
overlapping,
the
officers
can
be
prosecuted
as
the
district
court
held
under
242
that
the
private
individual
should
be
prosecuted
under
general
conspiracy
of
371
which
is
--
in
cases,
is
a
felony.
in
this
case,
it
would
not
be
because
the
object
of
371
is
242,
a
misdemeanor,
and
therefore
the
charge
against
all
of
the
defendants
under
371
in
this
particular
instance
has
to
do
with
a
felony
--
oh
excuse
me,
had
to
do
with
misdemeanor.
but
it
could,
in
other
cases,
have
to
do
with
the
felony.
but
without
overlapping,
we
have
242
as
to
the
action
under
color
of
law
in
regard
to
the
officers,
and
371
as
to
the
individuals.
now,
if
the
indictment
had
been
properly
drawn
and
directed
that
they
could
be
prosecuted,
that
private
individuals
under
242
also
by
the
aiding
and
abetting
statute,
they
can
be
prosecuted
then
on
the
substantive
charge
under
242
along
with
the
officers,
and
all
the
officers
and
the
private
individuals
prosecuted
under
371
for
general
conspiracy.
then
if
we
do
not
restrict
241
to
federal
type
rights,
it's
simply
in
effort
to
increase
the
punishment
to
go
back
and
pickup
241,
a
felony
charged
to
seek
to
prosecute
them,
all
the
defendants,
for
exactly
what
it
had
been
covered
in
242
and
371
and
under
the
aiding
and
abetting
statute
under
242
also.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
your
honor,
mr.
justice
that
is
our
contention.
and
we
understand
it,
if
a
decision
of
the
district
court
was
based
in
part
on
the
interpretation
of
the
indictment
that
on
direct
appeal,
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction
in
this
honorable
court.
that's
our
understanding.
but
of
course,
we
have
already
conceded
the
point
that
if
a
district
attorney
had
charged
those
individuals
as
we
see
it,
was
a
violation
of
the
aiding
and
abetting
statute
as
such,
that
that
indictment
would
have
stood.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
mr.
justice
stewart
that
may
be
correct.
we
feel
like
that
the
aiding
and
abetting
statute
section
2,
title
18
of
the
united
states
code
has
to
do
primarily
with
punishment,
perhaps
it
does.
and
though
it
was
not
specifically
mentioned,
it
might
have
been
the
duty
of
the
court
to
have
taken
judicial
notice
of
the
existence
of
the
aiding
or
abetting
statute.
i'm
trying
to
be
completely
as
fair
as
i
know
how
to
be
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice.
i
do
not
know
the
answer
as
to
whether
or
not
simply
because
the
aiding
and
abetting
statute
was
not
specifically
referred
to
in
the
indictment
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
should
have
taken
judicial
notice
there.
however,
we
do
feel
that
it
certainly
would
be
unfair
to
place
the
district
court
in
a
position
of
being
prosecutor,
as
well
as
judge
in
seeking
out
the
statutes
under
which
the
main
defendants
could
be
prosecuted.
we
respectfully
submit
in
conclusion
that
the
balance
of
power
between
the
states
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
if
the
facts
also
alleged,
your
honor,
in
the
indictment
to
such
an
extent
that
it
could
have
been
legally
determined
by
the
district
court,
that
such
acts
constituted
aiding
and
abetting,
yes
sir?
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
under
242.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
is
correct.
we
contend
that
the
decision
of
the
federal
district
judge
was
based
at
least
in
part
on
the
interpretation
of
the
indictment
and
that
the
government
did
not
charge
anything
that
he
did,
such
as
flashing
the
badge
and
--
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
no
sir.
mr.
h.
c.
mike
watkins
that
is
our
position
your
honor
that
since
it
may
have
been
based
in
part
on
an
interpretation
of
the
indictment
and
our
factual
situation
was
before
the
district
court,
that
the
matter
of
procedure
would
be
not
on
direct
appeal,
that
on
direct
appeal,
the
statute
specifically
authorizes
review
on
certain
cases,
that
is
the
construction
of
a
statute
or
construction
of
the
constitutional
amendments
or
otherwise.
that
is
our
position
your
honor.
we
respectfully
submit
in
conclusion
that
the
balance
of
power
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government
is
necessary
to
continue
and
give
the
proper
meaning
and
purpose
to
our
great
system
of
government,
and
here
principally,
as
referred
to
in
united
states
versus
williams,
we
are
dealing
also
with
that
balance
of
power
in
regard
to
essentially
local
matters
having
to
do
here
with
solely
natural
rights
between
one
citizen
and
another,
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
guarantee
does
not
add
anything
to
the
right
of
one
citizen
as
against
on
another
--
another
citizen
in
regard
to
protection
of
a
wrong
committed
by
one
citizen
against
another
when
that
fourteenth
amendment
guarantees,
as
well
as
the
fifteenth,
has
to
do
with
the
provision
against
encroachment
by
the
state
or
by
the
federal
government
in
15
in
regard
to
these
rights.
thank
you.
