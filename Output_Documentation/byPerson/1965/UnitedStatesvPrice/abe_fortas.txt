justice
abe
fortas
counsel,
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
suppose
that
this
indictment
had
charged
that
the
purpose
of
the
conspiracy
was
to
prevent
the
persons
who
were
murdered
from
leaving
the
state
of
mississippi
and
returning
to
let's
say
new
york.
would
that
make
any
difference
in
your
analysis?
justice
abe
fortas
if
this
was
property
going
from
mississippi
to
new
york,
it
would
be
interstate
commerce,
wasn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
want
to
pressure
you,
but
i
am
having
difficulty
with
the
concept
of
natural
rights
in
this
context
and
that's
the
reason
for
my
question
because
i'm
trying
to
postulate
an
indictment
in
which
the
interference
is
specifically
alleged
to
be
an
interference
with
the
movement
of
people
from
one
state
to
another
state,
which
in
ordinary
legal
parlance,
is
considered
to
be
interstate
commerce.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
from
you
is
whether
you
would
consider
that
to
be
within
this
category
of
natural
rights
or
whatever
they
may
be
or
whether
you
would
consider
those
to
be
an
interference
with
a
federally
protected
right,
i
mean
they
have
a
right
to
move
from
state
to
state.
