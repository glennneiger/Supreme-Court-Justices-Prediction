justice
potter
stewart
suppose
until
the
fifteenth
amendment,
the
right
didn't
exist.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
part
of
your
argument
that
--
that
there
would
be
a
lack
of
federal
constitutional
power
for
congress
to
have
enacted
a
statute
as
construed
by
the
solicitor
general?
justice
potter
stewart
federal
constitutional
power
under
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
any
of
the
constitution
or
any
of
its
amendments?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
--
that
this
statute
if
construed
by
--
as
the
solicitor
general
would
have
this
construe
it,
it's
not
a
proper
legislation
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
you
think
that
it
would
be
within
the
constitutional
power
of
the
congress
--
congress
purporting
to
exercise
its
power,
the
power
given
to
it
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
make
it
a
federal
offense
to
commit
the
crime
of
murder
in
any
state.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
--
i
don't
know
that
i
understand
your
answer
to
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
has
a
power?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
it's
certainly
murder,
let's
say
congress,
over
here
across
the
way,
congress
duly
assembles
and
“we're
now
going
to
exercise
our
powers.
we
understand
it
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
make
it
a
federal
offense
for
anybody
to
murder
anybody
else
in
any
state
of
the
united
states.”
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that's
within
the
power
given
to
congress
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
is
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
now
--
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
asking
you
if
you
think
the
congress
will
have
that
power
in
the
fourteenth
amendment?
or
let's
forget
murder,
let's
take
theft.
i
suppose
that's
--
i
suppose
that
if
i
steal
your
money,
i'm
depriving
you
of
property
without
due
process
of
law.
justice
potter
stewart
i
will
tell
you
--
if
you
think
the
courts
would
hold
it
invalid,
then
i
suppose
you're
saying
you
don't
think
congress
has
the
constitutional
power
to
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
gather
then
mr.
watkins,
if
you
say
this
is
not
the
construction
of
the
statute,
the
construction
of
the
indictment
because
the
dismissal
as
to
the
private
individuals
turned
on
the
omission
of
any
expressed
allegation
under
the
aider
or
abettor
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
the
aiding
and
abetting
statute
isn't
that
--
doesn't
set
out
a
substantive
offense,
don't
violate
that
statute?
maybe,
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
suppose
it
could
be
this
failure
to
mention
that
statute,
it
could
be
something
--
it
could
be
maybe
somebody
remedied
by
--
by
a
motion
to
make
(inaudible)
or
rather
for
a
particular
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
limits
a
little
bit.
justice
potter
stewart
--
(inaudible)
in
the
--
in
my
hypothetical
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
have
to
put
the
two
together.
they
can't
stand
on
screws
alone,
can
they?
