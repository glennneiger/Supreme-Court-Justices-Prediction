mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases,
as
all
the
world
knows,
arise
out
of
a
brutal
incident
during
the
summer
of
last
year
in
the
town
of
philadelphia
in
the
county
of
neshoba
in
the
state
of
mississippi
which
culminated
in
the
murder
of
three
young
civil
rights
workers;
michael
schwerner,
james
chaney
and
andrew
goodman.
these
federal
prosecutions
are
brought
under
sections
241
and
242
of
the
criminal
code
in
which
some
18
persons
--
three
of
them
public
officials,
are
accused
of
having
joined
together
to
deprive
the
three
young
victims
of
their
civil
rights.
the
actual
facts
cannot
be
detailed
because
no
trial
has
taken
place
and
the
evidence
has
not
been
deduced.
all
of
that's
before
the
court
today
is
a
bad
charge
consisting
of
two
indictments.
the
only
question
here
is
whether
those
indictments,
assuming
the
facts
alleged
can
be
proved,
state
offenses
against
the
united
states.
the
overall
charge
is
that
the
18
defendants
conceived
and
executed
a
criminal
plan
directed
against
the
three
victims.
it
is
alleged
that
the
three
of
the
defendants,
namely
the
sheriff
of
neshoba
county,
his
deputy,
and
a
local
policeman
used
their
official
powers
to
release
the
victims
who
were
in
state
custody,
turned
them
over
to
a
lynch
mob,
which
one
of
the
officers
had
shielded
by
his
presence
with
the
view
that
they'd
be
summarily
punished
without
benefit
of
trial
and
has
alleged
in
defiance
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
indictment
in
number
59
is
only
one
charge,
charges
a
conspiracy
that
was
in
charged
to
be
in
violation
of
section
241,
the
whole
of
that
indictment
was
dismissed
as
to
all
defendants.
the
first
count
of
indictment
in
number
60
is
the
same
conspiracy
as
charged
as
a
violation
of
the
general
conspiracy
statute,
section
371
of
the
criminal
code,
as
a
conspiracy
to
commit
the
offense
defined
in
section
242.
that
charge
was
sustained
by
the
district
court
as
to
all
defendants.
the
three
other
counts
of
indictment
--
the
indictment
in
number
60
charged
all
the
defendants
with
substantive
violations
of
section
242
by
executing
the
criminal
plan
with
respect
to
each
of
the
three
victims.
and
the
district
court
sustained
those
counts
as
to
the
three
state
officials,
the
three
state
law
enforcement
officers
but
dismissed
on
all
three
counts
as
to
all
other
defendants
because
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
specifically
so
except
in
one
portion,
the
“aider
and
abettor”
statute,
we
take
the
position,
is
they're
whether
or
not
242
--
242,
each
one
says
242,
in
violation
of
section
242.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
it's
our
position
because
when
--
as
we
see
it,
when
state
officers
are
involved,
and
then
the
conspiracy
moves
in
charging
the
state
officers
and
the
individuals
together,
but
it
would
not
apply
of
course
unless
the
state
officers
were
there.
and
in
this
case,
the
state
officers
are
there.
i
think
i
can
clear
it
up
a
little
later
on
that.
the
government,
on
both
indictments,
is
the
allegation
of
a
conspiracy
to
willfully
subject
the
victims
to
the
deprivation
of
“their
right,
privileges,
and
immunities
secured
and
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
not
be
summarily
punished
without
due
process
of
law
by
persons
under
color
of
the
state
of
mississippi”.
that's
in
the
indictment
--
that
particular
section
is
quoted
from
page
12
and
13.
and
before
going
any
further,
i
want
to
explain
the
relationship
between
this
case
and
more
particularly
number
59
in
the
guest
case
to
be
argued
next.
this
case
is
really
the
preamble
to
the
guest
case.
there
is
no
guest
case
unless
we
prevail
in
this
case
on
the
main
point
which
is,
that
section
241
protects
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
the
two
cases
are
thus
very
closely
related,
yet
i
would
like
to
stress
the
differences.
the
basic
factual
difference
of
course
is
that
here,
the
state
itself
through
its
law
enforcement
officers
and
their
confederates,
charged
with
invading
the
civil
rights
of
citizens,
while
in
the
guest
case,
the
interference
is
directly
attributable
solely
to
private
individuals.
here,
there
is
no
question
that
violation
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
alleged,
there's
no
question
about
it
as
i
see
it.
and
indeed,
the
district
judge
so
found
by
sustaining
the
charge
of
conspiring
to
violate
242
which
he
held
as
to
all
of
them.
the
only
question
in
this
case
i
repeat
is
whether
241
encompasses
fourteenth
amendment
rights
at
all,
and
that
is
not
a
constitutional
question.
at
least
since
the
screws
case,
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
about
the
power
of
congress
to
make
it
a
federal
crime
for
state
officers
to
deprive
citizens
of
their
constitutional
rights
even
if
the
conduct
also
violates
state
law,
the
sole
question
is
one
of
statutory
construction.
did
congress
mean
to
reach
violations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
section
241?
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
any
such
question
ever
arose.
indeed,
section
241
punishes
interference
with
exercise
or
enjoyment
of
“any
right
or
privilege
secured
by
the
constitution
or
laws
of
the
united
states.”
and
certainly,
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
a
part
of
that
constitution,
and
certainly,
the
fourteenth
amendment
confers
“rights
or
privileges”.
why
would
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
rights
not
be
embraced
by
the
provision?
one
could
imagine
that
doubt
at
the
statute
had
been
written
before
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
became
part
of
the
constitution,
but
that's
not
the
fact.
on
the
contrary,
section
241
was
enacted
in
may
of
1870
less
than
two
years
after
the
ratification
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
only
two
months
after
the
ratification
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
section
241
is
a
part
of
the
first
civil
rights
law
passed
after
the
adoption
of
the
amendments.
the
natural
assumption
is
that
the
new
statute
was
peculiarly
concerned
with
protecting
these
new
constitutional
rights.
is
there
anything
in
the
conditions
of
the
time
that
suggested
congress
was
focusing
on
rights
derived
from
the
relationship
of
the
citizen
to
the
national
government
rather
than
the
relationship
between
the
citizen
and
the
state
government?
the
time,
i
repeat,
was
1870.
this
was
a
reconstruction
measure.
the
problem
then
was
of
assuring
equal
rights
and
protection
to
the
new
freedmen
who
were
the
victims
of
racial
antagonism
against
that
background,
it
seems
obvious,
that
when
congress
spoke
of
constitutional
rights
had
meant
to
include
those
derived
from
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
the
right
to
freedom
from
racial
discrimination,
exercise
of
the
right
to
vote
guaranteed
in
the
fifteenth
amendment.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
case
of
strauder
against
west
virginia
and
it
seems
--
though
these
two
cases,
strauder
and
ex
parte
virginia
constantly
come
forward
again
but
i
think
it's
well
the
time
to
read
it
again.
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
i
mean
strauder
says,
the
fourteenth
amendment
makes
no
attempt
to
enumerate
the
rights
it
designed
to
protect,
it
speaks
in
general
terms
and
those
are
as
comprehensive
as
possible.
its
language
is
prohibitory,
but
every
prohibition
implies
the
existence
of
rights
and
immunities.
prominent
among
which
is
the
immunity
from
inequality
of
legal
protection
either
for
life,
liberty,
or
property.
any
state
action
that
denies
this
immunity
to
a
colored
man
is
in
conflict
with
the
constitution.
and
in
ex
parte
virginia,
mr.
justice
strong
continued,
“one
great
purpose
of
these
amendments
was
to
raise
the
colored
race”,
he
is
speaking
of
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment,
“was
to
raise
the
colored
race
from
that
condition
of
inferiority
and
servitude
in
which
most
of
them
had
previously
stood,
into
perfect
equality
of
civil
rights
with
all
other
persons
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
states.
they
who
intended
to
be
and
they
really
are,
limitations
to
the
power
of
the
states
and
enlargement
of
the
power
of
congress.”
i
repeat,
enlargement
of
the
power
of
congress.
“they
have
got
to
some
extent
declaratory
of
rights,
and
though
in
form
prohibitions,
they
imply
immunities
such
as
maybe
protected
by
congressional
legislation.”
now
that
was
the
real
problem.
it
was
not
the
problem
of
interference
with
the
homesteading
laws
or
the
federal
privilege,
to
inform
on
violations
of
tax
laws,
the
indictment
alleges
here
more
than
ordinary
murder
for
personal
reasons
by
a
group
of
individuals,
some
of
whom
happened
to
be
state
officers.
one,
it
is
alleged
that
the
state
law
enforcement
officers
were
acting
under
code
of
their
office.
and
two,
it
is
further
alleged
that
they
use
their
official
powers
to
release
state
prisoners,
turn
them
over
to
a
lynch
mob
which
was
shielded
by
the
presence
of
another
state
officer,
so
that
they
could
be
summarily
punished
without
benefit
of
trial.
this,
to
my
mind
puts
this
case
warily
within
the
rule
announced
in
the
screws
case,
and
indeed
within
the
rule
announced
in
the
williams
case
at
least
insofar
as
mr.
justice
douglas'
opinion
was
concerned.
in
the
screws
case,
there
was
no
problem
with
the
indictment,
no
court
found
any
problem
with
indictment
in
that
case.
and
in
the
williams
case,
if
you
read
the
indictment,
the
indictment
was
closely
similar
to
the
one
here.
finally,
is
there
something
in
the
debates
underlying
the
enactment
of
section
241
that
contradicts
the
entirely
clear
text
of
this
statute,
which
i
think
most
certainly
clearly
applies
here.
despite
the
language
and
the
historical
context
with
point
unmistakably
to
a
congressional
intent
to
protect
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
rights,
as
rights
and
privileges,
is
there
some
evidence
buried
in
the
legislative
history
that
shows
a
different
focus?
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind.
what
became
section
241
was
an
amendment
to
the
enforcement
act
of
1870
proposed
by
senator
pool
of
north
carolina,
he
proposed
the
amendment.
and
he
made
his
purpose
very
clear
and
there's
nothing
in
the
congressional
record
to
the
contrary,
on
this
particular
amendment.
the
only
relevant
speech
is
his
own,
when
he
first
explained
the
object
of
his
amendment,
we
have
reproduced
the
entire
speech
of
senator
pool
in
an
appendix
to
our
brief
on
the
merits
and
it
bails
out
what
i
have
said.
the
senator
begins
by
making
it
clear
that
this
is
a
reconstruction
measure.
it
is
entering
a
plan
of
new
phase
and
reconstruction
that
is,
he
says,
“to
enforce
by
appropriate
legislation,
those
great
principles
upon
which
the
reconstruction
policy
of
congress
was
based.”
he
then
tells
us
more
particularly,
the
conditions
he
is
concerned
about.
and
he
says
“the
equality,
which
by
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth,
and
fifteenth
amendments
has
been
attempted
to
be
secured
for
the
colored
men,
has
not
only
subjected
them
to
the
operation
of
the
prejudices
which
had
theretofore
existed,
but
it
has
raised
against
them
still
stronger
prejudices
and
stronger
feelings
in
order
to
fight
down
the
equality
by
which
it
is
claimed
they
are
to
control
the
legislation
of
that
section
of
the
country.
they
were
turned
loose
among
those
people,
weak,
ignorant,
and
poor.
those
among
the
white
citizens
there
who
have
sought
to
maintain
the
rights
which
you
have
thrown
upon
that
class
of
people,
have
to
endure
every
species
of
proscription,
of
opposition,
and
of
vituperation
in
order
to
carry
out
the
policy
of
congress,
in
order
to
lift
up
and
to
uphold
the
rights
which
you
have
conferred
upon
that
class.
it
is
for
that
reason
not
only
necessary
for
the
freedmen,
but
it
is
necessary
for
the
white
people
of
that
section
that
there
should
be
stringent
and
effective
legislation
on
the
part
of
congress
in
regard
to
these
measures
of
reconstruction”.
though
most
of
his
speech
is
directed
to
the
fifteenth
amendment,
senator
pool
plainly
puts
fourteenth
amendment
rights
and
particularly
those
derived
from
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
on
the
same
footing.
this
is
first,
there
is
first,
the
long
passage
quote
in
our
brief
at
page
40
and
41,
which
he
emphasized
the
word
'deny'
in
those
clauses.
and
he
says,
“the
word
deny
is
used
not
only
in
this
fifteenth
amendment
but
i
perceive
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
is
also
read”.
and
again
later,
when
he
is
speaking
of
the
need
to
teach
or
to
reach
unofficial
conspiracies,
the
senate
takes
explicitly
refers
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
he
says,
“but
sir,
individuals
may
prevent
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
suffrage,
individuals
may
prevent
the
enjoyment
of
other
rights
which
are
conferred
upon
the
citizen
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
well
as
trespass
upon
the
right
conferred
by
the
fifteenth.”
this
last
statement
from
senator
pool's
speech,
emphasizing
his
concern
with
unofficial
action,
particularly
conspiracies
like
the
plan
which
he
explicitly
mentions,
suggests
the
only
argument
against
reading
section
41
to
reach
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
rights.
it
has
been
said
that
because
this
statute,
unlike
242,
is
not
confined
to
acts
done
under
color
of
law
to
officials.
it
cannot
have
been
meant
to
protect
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
rights,
which
can
only
be
invaded
by
state
officers
or
at
least
by
persons
acting
color
--
under
color
of
state
law.
and
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
for
the
four
justices
in
the
williams
case,
the
conclusion
does
not
inexorably
follow
from
the
premises,
even
if
the
congress
of
1870
had
believed
that
it
could
not
reached
private
individuals
who
interfered
with
the
exercise
of
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
rights,
but
which
to
protect
the
right
one
provision
which
protected
all
constitutional
rights,
it
might
well
have
written
the
same
words
we
find
in
section
241.
they
are
--
or
rather
they
collect
the
constitution
itself,
operate
to
confine
the
class
of
those
who
had
compassed
--
to
commit
the
crime
where
the
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
amendment
was
involved.
that
is
indeed
exactly
what
congress
did.
but
the
true
explanation
is
that
neither
senator
pool
nor
the
congress
of
1870
saw
any
problem
with
this.
they
thought
rightly
or
wrongly,
and
we
believe
they
were
right
as
we
will
argue
in
the
guest
case,
that
they
could
constitutionally
reach
private
conspiracies
hostile
to
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments.
you
cannot
reach
senator
pool's
speech
without
reaching
that
conclusion.
and
if
any
proof
or
further
proof
were
needed,
you
only
have
to
look
at
the
klan
act
of
1871
which
this
court
invalidated
in
united
states
against
harris.
now
as
i
have
said,
we
think
the
congress
of
1870
was
right
in
its
premise,
but
it
does
not
automatically
follow
that
the
question
in
this
case
depends
upon
a
case
where
there
are
no
state
officers
involved.
if
only
persons
acting
under
color
of
law
can
be
reached,
enforced
--
in
enforcing
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments,
then
section
241
must
be
read
accordingly.
it
would
be
nonsense
i
say,
to
say
that
the
congress
of
1870
did
not
mean
to
reach
any
interference
with
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
amendment
rights,
because
they
thought
they
were
reaching
something
that
the
inference
would
not
allow
them
to
reach.
i
say
that
on
the
particular
point
involved
here,
that
first
of
all
i've
--
we
have
to
make
our
position
clear.
and
that
we
are
not
here
asserting
that
congress
intended
to
cover
every
crime
committed
under
state
law,
and
indeed
in
all
of
the
briefs
on
the
other
side
is
alleged
that
this
is
peculiarly
state
crime,
or
what
have
you.
but
i
respectfully
recall
the
court's
attention
to
the
1884
decision
in
the
waddell
case.
and
speaking
of
the
same
provision
said,
“the
right
here
guarantied
is
not
the
mere
right
of
protection
against
personal
violence.
this
is
the
result
of
an
ordinary
quarrel
or
malice,
would
be
cognizable
under
the
laws
of
the
state
and
by
its
courts.
but
it
is
something
different
from
that.
it
is
the
right
to
remain
on
the
land
in
order
to
perform
the
requirements
of
the
act
of
congress,
and,
according
to
its
rules,
perfect
his
incipient
title”.
and
under
the
waddell
case,
i
think
the
same
provision
would
be
here
if
the
defendants
in
this
case
where
merely
out
to
commit
an
ordinary
crime
“as
a
result
of
an
ordinary
quarrel
or
malice”
it
would
be
strictly
state,
but
that
is
not
the
case.
i
believe
as
i
have
said
earlier,
that
the
two
cases
which
control
this
case,
are
the
screws
case
and
that
united
states
against
williams.
and
i
think
it's
very
interesting
that
everybody
relies
on
united
states
against
williams.
and
i
would
like
for
a
moment
to
explain
our
position
as
to
the
case
in
the
first
place,
the
decision
was
four
to
four
with
mr.
justice
black
concurring
on
a
different
point.
but
as
to
the
points
involved
in
this
case,
it
was
definitely
a
four
to
four
decision.
and
the
language
in
the
--
what
is
labeled
in
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas
concurred
in
by
mr.
justice
reed,
mr.
justice
burton
and
mr.
justice
clark,
they
traced
the
whole
history
of
these
sections,
both
of
the
sections
and
brought
the
sections
up
to
date,
both
19
and
20.
and
i
have
no
need
to
go
back
further
in
this
because
in
both
of
the
opinions
in
the
williams
case,
senator
pool
was
referred
to,
the
only
addition
we
have
made
in
our
position
in
this
case
is
to
prick
more
fully
the
whole
argument
or
rather
the
whole
speech
made
by
senator
pool.
and
in
the
williams
case,
after
the
language,
the
constitutional
history
--
the
congressional
history
rather
was
reviewed
and
the
screws
case
was
reviewed.
that
opinion
made
it
quite
clear
that
fourteenth
amendment
rights
were
to
be
protected.
and
in
this
particular
case,
you
add
to
fact
that
as
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
in
the
three
latter
counts
in
the
number
60
case,
the
court
actually
held
the
state
officers
to
be
liable.
and
then
with
the
same
vein,
it
comes
back
and
says,
“but
it
does
not
apply.”
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can't
say
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
in
one
place
and
it
does
not
apply
in
the
other
particular
position.
the
emphasis
in
the
--
the
second
emphasis
was
on
senator
pool's
speeches
which
we
have
quoted
and
in
the
william's
case,
it
was
pointed
out
that
as
mr.
justice
rutledge
stated
in
the
screws
case,
there
is
no
difference
between
section
19
and
section
20
so
far
as
the
basic
rights
guarded
are
concerned,
the
coverage
of
the
two
sections
is
not
coterminous.
the
difference
is
not
merely
on
the
fact
that's
19
covers
conspiracies
and
20
covers
substantive
offenses.
section
20
extends
only
to
those
who
act
under
color
of
law,
while
19
reaches
two
or
more
persons
who
conspire
to
injure
any
citizen
in
the
enjoyment
of
any
rights
or
privilege
secured
to
him
by
the
constitution.
the
reach
of
20
over
deprivations
of
rights
protected
from
invasion
by
private
persons,
is
therefore
in
this
one
respect
less
than
that
of
19.
but
this
is
no
comfort
to
the
respondents
in
the
present
case.
it
certainly
cannot
be
doubted
that
state
officers
or
those
under
--
acting
under
color
of
state
law
who
conspire
to
wring
confessions
from
an
accused
by
force
and
violence,
are
included
in
the
phrase
“two
or
more
persons”
within
the
meaning
of
section
19.
and
that
from
the
williams
case,
it
seems
to
me
applies
in
this
particular
case
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
save
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
about
congress
passing
act
that
implies
to
murder,
in
45
of
the
government's
brief
in
appendix.
you
will
see
section
7,
which
did
just
that,
and
congress
later
repealed
it.
section
7,
and
that
was
appealed
later.
so
i
mean
obviously,
the
congress
decided
they
didn't
have
power
to
do
that.
the
other
question
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
1894.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they
tried
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
but
even
that,
it's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
other
question
about
the
“aider
and
abettor”
i
think
should
point
out
that
in
60,
and
each
one
of
the
substantive
counts
second,
third
and
fourth,
it
is
alleged
that
all
18,
including
the
private
individuals,
“while
acting
under
color
of
the
laws
of
the
state
of
mississippi
is
alleged
in
each
one
of
those
counts.”
and
the
theory
was
obviously
relied
on
the
aider
and
abettor
statute.
and
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
(voice
overlap)
--
we
have
set
out
in
footnotes
on
page
9
and
33
of
the
government's
brief
cases
i
thought
was
perfectly
clear
that
you
didn't
have
to
allege
specifically
under
the
aid
and
abettor
statute.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
i
understand
his
argument
to
be
that
when
the
district
judge
says
that
since
you
don't
allege
that
one
of
the
men
flash
the
badge,
then
the
factual
basis
is
lacking.
what
he
really
means
is
that
unless
you
show
that
each
defendant
is
a
state
officer,
242
doesn't
apply.
that's
not
a
factual
determination,
that's
a
legal
determination.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
a
legal
determination
of
--
and
the
construction
of
the
statute.
there
is
no
fact
in
that
at
all.
and
i
say
that
the
allegation
that
they
acted
under
color
of
state,
the
law
of
the
state
of
mississippi
which
in
each
one
of
those
three
counts
is
enough.
the
other
point
--
the
only
other
point
i'd
like
to
mention
is
this
constant
argument
that
--
it
of
course
applies
--
241
applies
to
the
fifteenth
amendment
but
they
say
it's
because
of
article
1.
but
from
all
of
the
cases
--
guinn,
myers
and
anderson,
mosley,
and
all
of
them,
they
talked
about
the
fifteenth
amendment.
that
didn't
talk
about
article
1.
classic
does,
but
classic
then
goes
ahead
and
talks
about
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendment
rights
just
like
everybody
understands
them.
i
don't
believe
it
can
be
limited
to
that
and
we
would
urge
that
the
court
reverse.
if
there
is
any
question
about
technicalities
on
the
indictment,
that
can
be
worked
out
on
the
district
court
level.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
take
position
mr.
justice
clark
that
cruikshank
went
off
on
that
one
little
point
as
i
remember
--
i
mean,
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
on
the
question
about
the
race
not
being
involved
and
that
is
always
(inaudible).
but
i
did
not
rely
on
one
way
or
another
in
our
brief
because
starting
with
the
screws
and
williams,
i
take
the
position
that
all
of
those
cases
now
stand
in
a
different
category
because
they
were
all
reviewed
so
thoroughly
and
why
do
we
have
to
go
back
again
to
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
i
think
you
could
find
that
--
we've
got
it
in
our
brief.
it
would
be
--
it
can
--
i
don't
think
--
as
long
as
we
have
screws
and
williams,
i
don't
think
we
have
any
problem
of
overruling
any
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
was
a
four
to
four.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
for
intensive
purposes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
justice
douglas'
opinion.
i
think
that
the
possibility
is
that
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
i
put
the
two
of
them
together
and
then
i
take
that
you
don't
have
to
go
any
further
than
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
we
have
to
put
the
two
together.
i
do
say
that
in
the
screws
which
will
come
up
considerably
in
the
next
case,
i
think
that
the
whole
purpose
in
screws
was
to
not
be
forced
to
throw
the
section
completely
out,
and
to
find
a
way
that
would
make
it
constitutional.
and
indeed,
when
you
read
mr.
justice's
opinion
on
williams,
he
uses
that
for
that
purpose
and
we
intend
to
use
it
in
defense.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
screws
was
on
241--
or
242.
242.
it's
242,
because
with
the
sheriff
and
an
assistant.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
that
when
you
take
the
two
together,
the
reasoning
that
oppose
242
which
was
that
you
have
to
put
some
limitation
on
this
in
order
for
it
to
be
constitutional,
the
limitation
is
that
you
must
allege
intent
to
deprive
the
victim
of
his
rights
guaranteed.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
specifically,
specifically.
now
in
williams,
it
was
made
quite
clear
that
under
the
conspiracy
statute,
you
get
the
same
kind
of
intent,
you
don't
--
you
don't
conspire
to
do
good.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
well,
i
think
that's
good
enough
for
us.
thank
you
sir.
