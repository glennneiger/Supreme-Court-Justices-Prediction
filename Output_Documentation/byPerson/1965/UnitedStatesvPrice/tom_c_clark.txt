242
was
held
against
the
officers
but
not
the
civilians.
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
was
the
theory
of
dismissal
on
242
against
civilians?
justice
tom
c.
clark
do
you
think
they'd
have
to
use
those
words
--
aiding
and
abetting?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
indictment
--
the
indictment
did
allege
that
the
officer
released
these
parties?
justice
tom
c.
clark
not
--
not
as
private
individuals?
justice
tom
c.
clark
by
all
of
them?
justice
tom
c.
clark
including
officers,
as
well
as
private
--
justice
tom
c.

what
effect
does
cruikshank
you
have
on
this
case?
justice
tom
c.
clark
we
wouldn't
have
to
overrule
the
cruikshank?
justice
tom
c.

the
written
opinion
in
williams,
in
the
court
opinion.
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
mean
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
mean
justice
douglas'
opinion.
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
all
you
do
is
you
linked
screws
and
justice
douglas'
opinion
in
williams
together?
justice
tom
c.
clark
in
your
position?
justice
tom
c.
clark
now
screws
--
i
mean,
in
screws,
was
it
under
242?
justice
tom
c.
clark
do
you
see
any
difference
--
did
you
file
that
same
reason
in
241?
justice
tom
c.
clark
specifically?
justice
tom
c.
clark
now
of
course,
you'd
have
to
have
a
majority
opinion
in
williams.
in
other
words,
you
see
it's
only
two
of
us
left.
