justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
quite
get
that,
you
mean,
brought
to
the
attention
without
any
expressed
allegation
of
the
indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
indictment
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
watkins,
may
i
just
get
this
point
clear.
may
i
just
ask
you
this
question?
i
gather
that
even
though
you
concede
as
to
the
private
individual
that
this
indictment
had
alleged
the
aiding
and
abetting
statute,
it
would
have
been
a
good
indictment
against
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
under
242?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
242.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
gather
you
also
say
notwithstanding
act
from
session.
there
is
no
jurisdiction
here
to
review
because
what
the
decision
below
turned
on
dismissing
the
individual
or
the
private
individual
was
the
interpretation
of
the
indictment
as
not
embracing
them
because
it
did
not
make
the
allegation,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
so
that
even
if
we
were
to
disagree
with
you
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
an
expressed
allegation,
even
if
we
were
to
say
that
we
read
the
indict
--
an
expressed
reference
to
the
aiding
and
abetting
statute
was
not
required,
it
would
still
say
i
gather
that
we
have
no
jurisdiction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
that
--
this
determination
that
it
wasn't
necessary
expressly
to
make
the
allegation
has
been
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
jurisdiction
can't
be
made
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what,
mr.
solicitor
general,
about
mr.
watkins'
point
that
even
if
nothing
more
than
this
is
required
to
invoke
the
aider
and
abettor
statute,
nevertheless
as
a
matter
of
our
jurisdiction,
we
can't
say
that.
an
appeal
should've
been
taken
on
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
say
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
know
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that's
his
argument.
i'm
not
suggesting
--
i
agree
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
his
argument,
as
i
understand
mr.
watkins,
his
argument
is
that
whether
or
not
the
indictment
was
sufficient
to
embrace
the
aider
and
abettor
statute,
it's
something
we
can't
decide
here
because
that's
the
question
of
interpretation
of
the
indictment
and
therefore
not
an
interpretation
of
construction
of
the
statute.
there
was
--
there
is
no
direct
--
no
jurisdiction
on
direct
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
appeal.
