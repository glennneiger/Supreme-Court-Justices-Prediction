did
anybody
at
this
stage
claim
reversionary
rights
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
guarantee
to
the
testator?
justice
potter

he
was
veteran
of
confederate
army?
justice
potter

he
has
been
[inaudible]
senator
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
claiborne
and
i,
perhaps
you
told
us
but
i
--
so
i
didn't
get
it.
do
you
think
that
anything
this
court
can
or
should
do
to
prevent
the
property
reverting
to
the
senator's
heirs?
justice
potter
stewart
the
way
of
--
that's
being
the
question
if
you
--
a
private
park
certainly
can
be
operated
cannot
it
not
in
a
discriminatory
way?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
i
suggested
that
if
you
were
beginning
with
your
answer,
when
you
said
--
when
you
refer
to
this
as
a
public
park.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
a
person
can
leave
a
piece
of
property
and
say,
“i
want
this
property
be
used
for
a
playground
for
colored
children
and
administered
by
private
trustees.”
i
suppose
that
would
not
be
unconstitutional,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
we're
not
open
to
any
adults
of
any
race
or
to
any
children
of
the
white
race.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
matter
of
degree,
a
little
less
or
a
little
more.
i
was
suggesting
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
wouldn't
apply
at
all
in
a
case
of
a
private
testator
who
left
his
piece
--
his
vacant
lot
to
be
used
as
a
playground
for
colored
children
and
administered
by
private
trustees.
now
do
you
think
that
this
is
a
matter
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
applying
somewhat
but
not
very
much?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
an
orphanage
or
a
hospital
or
a
home
for
unmarried
mothers
or
a
day
nursery,
just
to
think
of
a
few
things
at
random.
are
you
suggesting
that
a
testator
could
not
establish
an
orphanage
for
protestant
--
white
protestant
orphans
or
a
hospital
for
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
colored
unmarried
mothers
or
a
--
or
a
day
nursery
for
working
women
of
the
jewish
faith?
justice
potter
stewart
overall
functions
which
here
and
there
are
performed
by
government.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
a
school?
can
a
private
testator
leave
several
million
dollars
for
the
establishment
of
a
school
for
the
limited
to
the
children
of
impoverished
italian
immigrants
or
what
--
or
would
that
school
have
to
be
open
to
everybody
and
break
his
will
in
order
to
do
so?

restricted
admission
policy.
again
you're
--
you're
beginning
with
the
answer
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
thought
that
the
primary
--
your
market
as
a
park
whether
it
was
closed
to
colored
people
and
therefore
was
not
public,
it
was
operated
on
a
discriminating
or
discriminatory
basis
confined
to
the
white
race.
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
is
the
park
system
or
the
other
parks
or
the
ordinary
parks
are
making
the
administrative
board
by
park
board,
do
you
have?
justice
potter
stewart
to
a
committee?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
that
--
was
it
within
--
was
this
property
while
the
legal
title
is
in
the
city,
was
this
property
under
the
jurisdiction
of
committee?
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
board
of
managers
have
anything
to
do
with
any
of
the
other
parks
in
the
city?
justice
potter
stewart
for
this
particular
park
as
well
as
i
gather
administering

senator
bacon
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
that
your
point
that
the
marsh
case
supports
you
insofar
as
it
holds
that
who
has
the
naked
legal
title
is
not
the
dispositive
issue,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
that
there
was
a
public
trustee?
justice
potter
stewart
public
trustee
resigns
from
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
there's
nothing
peculiar
about
the
law
of
chari
--
charitable
trust
in
this
respect
of
the
state
of
georgia
is
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
this
is
the
characteristic
of
all
charitable
trust
(voice

speaking
everywhere,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
not
only
this
charitable
trust
but
all
the
charitable
trust.
i
thought
i
don't
know
the
laws
of
50
states
and
i
presume
you
don't
either
but
i
thought
that
this
was
a
characteristic
of
a
charitable
trust.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
fourteenth
amendment
doesn't
say
anything
about
race
at
all.
if
you're
right
wouldn't
that
apply
to
all
--
any
kind
of
restrictions,
sexual
or
to
say
that
you
will
set
up
a
school
for
boys
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
because
that
would
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
if
you're
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well
surely
if
the
state
--
if
this
is
the
state
public
governmental
functional
what
you
say
is
correct
about
race.
i
would
suppose
it
would
also
be
true
that
you
couldn't
have
a
park
for
protestants
only
or
for
jewish
people
only
and
so
i'm
suggesting
only
that
the
--
the

now
you
are
talking
particularly
about
the

action?
