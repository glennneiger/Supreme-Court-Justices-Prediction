mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
question
of
racial
segregation
in
a
large
public
park
in
the
city
of
macon,
georgia
which
is
open
to
the
entire
public
except
the
negroes.
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
which
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
superior
court
of
bibb
county.
the
case
arrived
that
its
present
posture
after
a
lengthy
series
of
pleadings
involving
five
sets
of
parties,
the
board
of
managers
of
the
park,
baconsfield,
certain
heirs
named
sparks
and
certain
heirs
named
curry,
the
city
of
macon
and
the
negro
interveners,
and
some
of
these
parties
shifted
their
position
that
during
the
course
of
the
litigation
in
ways
that
significantly
affected
the
substantive
rights
involved
and
they
asked
the
court's
indulgence
while
i
relate
the
substance
of
this
series
of
papers
which
may
be
tedious
so
that
the
case
can
properly
be
understood.
the
case
was
commenced
by
an
entity
known
as
the
board
of
managers
of
the
park
which
was
named
baconsfield
that
was
created
in
a
will
written
in
1911.
the
board
originally
had
been
appointed
by
the
city
of
macon
and
all
successor
members
of
the
board
since
it
came
into
being
or
appointed
by
the
mayor
and
council
of
the
city
of
macon.
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
was
there,
there
was
a
will
which
had
the
trust
following
the
death
of
certain
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
for
the
board
of
managers,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
by
the
mayor
and
city
council,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
all
in
the
will,
yes.
now
the
board
which
had
been
appointed
by
the
city
mr.
justice
brennan
then
brought
suit
against
the
city.
it
turned
on
its
part
in
a
sense
charging
that
the
city
had
not
been
faithful
to
a
racially
restrictive
provision
in
the
will
of
the
late
senator
who's
name
was
augustus
octavius
bacon
and
because
the
will
had
originally
created
the
park
for
white
persons
only.
the
city
feeling
that
it
was
inhibited
by
law
from
enforcing
this
racial
restriction
had
not
enforced
it
for
several
weeks
preceding
the
institution
of
the
suit
in
1963.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
that's
right.
in
1963,
negroes
had
started
going
upon
the
property.
the
board
of
managers
had
asked
the
city
to
enforce
this
provision
of
the
will.
the
city
had
not
enforced
the
will.
the
board
of
managers
brought
suit
against
the
city.
the
board
asserted
in
its
complaint
that
if
the
city
would
discharge
its
trustee
and
if
three
private
trustees
were
then
substituted,
the
board
could
bring
suit
against
the
city
in
mandamus
or
otherwise
to
compel
it
presumably
in
its
police
capacity
to
do
something
which
was
inhibited
from
doing
in
it's
trustee
capacity.
and
it
said
in
its
complaint
that
--
they
said
that
the
city
would
discharge
this
trustee
and
a
private
trustee
were
appointed
instead,
the
private
trustees
could
then
mandamus
the
city.
it
will
bring
some
other
kind
of
preceding
against
the
city
or
other
law
enforcement
officers
to
carryout
these
duties
so
that
the
racially
restricted
provisions
of
the
will
would
be
observed.
now
the
city
didn't
resist
the
complaint.
it
admitted
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
it
said
two
things.
it
said
two
things.
one,
it
could
not
convey
the
property
to
carryout
this
intent
of
the
testator,
and
two,
it
could
not
enforce
racial
segregation.
and
it
threw
its
hands
up
and
asked
the
court
for
instructions
about
what
to
do.
another
set
of
defendants
in
addition
to
the
city
were
a
group
appears
know
as
the
[inaudible]
and
they
were
sued
and
they
admitted
all
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
they
joined
in
the
prayer
of
the
complaint.
they're
the
defendants,
they
joined
in
the
prayer
of
the
complaints.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
no
(voice
overlap)
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
not
at
this
stage.
the
board
then
moved
a
summary
judgment,
now
before
the
superior
court
could
rule
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
negro
citizens
of
macon
intervened
in
this
theretofore
relatively
non-controversial
lawsuit
and
asserted
that
baconsfield
was
a
public
park
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibited
the
court
from
entering
an
order
of
appointing
successor
trustees
who
could
operate
and
maintain
baconsfield
on
a
segregated
basis.
the
board
of
managers
responded
to
this
by
asking
for
an
injunction
excluding
negroes
from
the
park
and
to
allow
certain
other
areas
known
as
the
sparks
to
intervene
in
the
case
and
permit
the
[inaudible]
who
previously
had
been
sued
to
realign
themselves
on
the
side
of
the
plaintiffs.
previously
they've
been
the
defendants.
and
both
sets
of
heirs
then
filed
additional
pleadings
joining
in
the
prayer
of
the
board
of
mangers
and
also
asking
for
an
injunction
to
keep
all
negroes
out
of
the
park.
and
the
heirs'
pleadings
at
this
point
stated
that
in
the
event
that
the
will
of
the
testator
with
regard
to
the
segregation
condition
could
not
be
achieved.
they
asked
that
the
property
then
referred
to
them,
approximately
100
acres
in
the
center
of
the
city
of
macon.
well,
while
all
this
was
pending
and
the
court
did
not
yet
resolve
it.
matters
came
to
ahead
when
the
city
of
macon
adopted
a
resolution
that
amounted
to
consenting
to
a
judgment
against
it.
it
adopted
a
resolution
purporting
to
resign
as
trustee,
the
resolution
admitted
that
the
testators'
intent
with
regard
to
segregation
is
not
going
to
pay,
it
asserted
that
the
city
deemed
that
in
the
public
interest
that
this
be
operated
as
a
public
park
although
into
the
white
public
rather
than
revert
to
the
heirs
as
private
property,
said
that
it
could
not
in
good
conscience
operate
a
non-segregated
park
in
will
of
the
testator
and
authorized
the
mayor
and
the
council
to
sign
a
written
resignation
and
to
divert
to
the
court.
and
this
is
what
they
did
with
an
amended
pleading
in
which
the
mayor
and
council
prayed
that
the
court
accept
the
resignation.
they
asked
for
permission
to
resign
and
the
resignation
was
not
self-executing.
they
asked
for
permission
to
resign.
they
asked
that
private
trustees
be
appointed
and
then
they
said
if
private
trustees
were
appointed,
they
would
have
no
further
duties
and
that
they
would
no
longer
be
a
necessary
party
for
litigation.
at
this
point,
the
negro
interveners
filed
a
further
paper
amending
their
petition
and
alleged
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibited
the
relief
requested
by
the
plaintiffs
and
the
city
and
prayed
that
the
court
withhold
approval
of
the
resignation.
the
court
however,
accepted
the
resignation
and
the
court
appointed
new
trustees
and
the
court
retained
jurisdiction
for
the
purpose
of
appointing
additional
trustees
should
vacancies
occur.
and
along
with
its
judgment,
they
wrote
a
letter
of
opinion
that
appears
on
page
6
of
our
brief
stating
why
this
was
done.
it's
in
the
footnote,
the
letter
opinion
stated
the
inability
of
the
city
of
macon
as
trustee
to
apply
constitutionally
the
racial
criterion
prescribed
by
the
testator
for
use
of
the
property
as
a
park
for
white
women
and
white
children
affected
the
trustee
and
not
the
trust.
and
the
city
had
intended
its
resignation
as
trustee.
it
is
proper
that
the
court
accept
the
resignation
and
appoint
private
trustees
who
can
carryout
the
purpose
and
intent
of
the
testator
as
set
forth
in
the
will.
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
the
state
supreme
court
affirmed
primarily
viewing
the
case
as
one
in
which
the
superior
court
was
faced
with
a
vacancy
in
the
trusteeship
and
stating
that
courts
of
equity
always
can
appoint
trustees
whenever
there
is
a
vacancy.
now,
senator
bacon's
will
which
is
the
subject
of
this
case
was
written
in
1911,
six
years
after
the
passage
of
a
georgia
statute
that
plays
an
important
part
in
this
litigation.
section
69-504
of
the
georgia
code
which
appears
on
page
3
of
our
brief
provides
that
any
person
may
give
to
any
municipal
corporation
in
the
state
in
fee
simple
or
entrust
or
the
private
persons
as
trustees,
lands
dedicated
in
perpetuity
to
the
public
as
a
park.
and
then
the
conveyance
provide
that
the
use
of
the
park
shall
be
limited
to
the
white
race
only
or
to
white
women
and
children
only
or
to
the
colored
race
only
or
to
colored
women
and
children
only
or
to
any
other
race,
or
the
women
and
children
of
any
other
race
only.
and
then
the
subsequent
section,
section
505
of
the
code,
the
municipalities
were
empowered
to
accept
such
gifts.
senator
bacon's
will
in
items
9
and
10,
established
the
park
of
baconsfield
after
the
death
of
his
wife
and
two
daughters
and
virtually
the
language
of
the
statute,
following
the
statute
very
closely,
he
established
the
park
for
the
use
of
white
women
and
children
of
the
city
of
macon
only,
although
he
authorized
his
trustees
in
their
discretion
to
permit
white
men
or
white
residents
of
other
cities
to
enter
the
park,
something
which
later
was
authorized.
now,
petitioners
submit
that
the
judgment
below
and
its
the
judgment
we're
focusing
on
which
accepted
resignations
and
appointed
new
trustees
was
erroneous
and
therefore
should
be
reversed.
this
judgment
if
undone
would
lead
the
parties
where
they
were
before
the
commencement
of
this
litigation
with
the
result
that
is
obedient
to
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
believe
it
has
any
bearing
at
all
as
far
as
i
can
understand.
mr.
justice
brennan
because
in
the
first
appeal
in
gerard
where
certiorari
was
granted
and
the
judgment
was
reversed,
the
appeal
also
was
dismissed,
and
so
i
gather
the
dismissal
of
the
appeal
in
gerard
one
and
gerard
two
was
on
a
technical
jurisdictional
point.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits
that
sometimes
dismissal
of
an
appeal
does.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
pretty
much
with
the
exception
of
the
statute
69-504,
which
we
believe
makes
the
difference
but
otherwise
the
cases
are
quite
alike.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
yes,
the
appeal
was
dismissed
--
and
the
first
go
aorund
the
appeals
was
dismissed,
cert
was
granted,
and
it
was
to
reverse.
in
the
second
go
around
the
appeal
was
dismissed
and
cert
was
denied
to
the
extent
that
i
can
infer
from
that,
it
seems
to
me
the
dismissal
on
each
of
the
cases
was
on
a
non-substantive
ground.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
think
there
may
be
but
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
appeal
was
dismissed
in
one
posture
of
the
case,
and
relief
was
granted
and
then
another
part
of
the
case,
the
appeal
was
also
dismissed
and
relief
was
denied
and
i
can
only
guess
that
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
i
will
assume
it
had
something
to
do
with
whether
or
not
the
state
statute
was
officially
involved
in
the
case
to
make
an
appeal
case
rather
than
a
certiorari
case.
now
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
is
erroneous
for
a
number
of
reasons
which
taken
together
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
while
it
was
necessary,
the
interveners
or
petitioners
here
could
argue
that
any
one
of
these
factors
indicates
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
been
violated.
certainly
cumulatively
we
submit
as
i
burton
against
the
wilmington
parking
authority,
we
have
here
such
an
aggregation
of
facts
here
as
to
constitute
that
critical
mess,
that
--
that
accumulation
which
adds
up
to
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
and
of
course,
these
factors
is
the
section
69-504
of
the
georgia
code,
now
what
was
the
relationship
between
69-504
and
senator
bacon's
will
the
provision
that
set
up
the
park
and
set
it
up
as
racially
restricted
park.
respondents
say
on
page
52
of
their
brief
that
senator
bacon
probably
did
not
even
know
that
section
69-504
existed.
now,
we
say
that
this
contention
has
to
be
rejected
just
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
law
is
on
the
books,
but
beyond
that,
we
have
to
take
into
account,
something
which
is
got
in
the
record,
but
historical
facts,
senator
bacon
was
a
lawyer.
he
was
a
member
of
the
bar.
he
had
a
will
here
which
is
a
highly
complicated
will
but
obviously
if
he
didn't
draw
it
himself,
he
would
draw
with
legal
advice,
and
that
he's
just
totally
incredible
that
he
or
his
counsel
did
not
know
that
there
was
this
section
on
the
books
which
his
will
practically
parallels
in
its
language,
the
coincidence
is
too
incredibly
for
that.
now,
if
one
were
contemplating
setting
up
a
will
for
white
women
park,
white
women
and
children
only,
i
can
tell
that
the
george
law
of
1911,
he
would
have
found
that
part
in
section
69-504,
the
george
law
of
charitable
trusts
which
appears
on
page
24
and
25
of
our
brief,
lists
a
series
of
purposes
for
which
a
charitable
trust
may
be
established.
and
there
is
nothing
which
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
can
be
held
to
constitute
authority
to
set
up
a
park
by
charitable
trust.
at
the
very
least
a
conscious
lawyer
setting
up
a
charitable
trust
involving
an
awful
lot
of
money,
would
have
great
hesitation
to
setting
one
up
on
the
mere
authority
of
the
charitable
trust
statute
as
it
appears
in
the
brief.
if
he
would
then
look
at
the
other
authority
for
setting
up
a
park
for
white
women
and
children
only,
he
would
look
at
the
general
law
of
dedication
which
is
the
method
by
which
parks
usually
are
established
and
he
would
find
that
if
you
dedicate
something
to
the
public
and
there
would
be
some
georgia
authority,
for
this
is
well
a
general
authority,
it
must
be
to
the
whole
public
and
it's
impossible
to
dedicate
something
only
to
a
portion
of
the
public.
so
he
would
have
been
in
considerable
doubt
as
to
whether
he
could
set
up
a
park
by
charitable
trust
for
white
women
and
children
only.
he
would
either
be
faced
with
the
alternative
of
setting
up
a
park
for
everybody
or
setting
up
no
park
at
all,
but
when
he
turned
to
section
69-504,
he
would
have
seen
the
solution
to
his
problem,
an
explicit
authority
to
accomplish
what
he
desired.
and
so
we
state
that
as
in
anderson
against
martin
and
peterson
against
greenville
--
city
of
greenville,
here
is
a
state
law
which
intrudes
itself
into
the
process
and
incorporates
a
racial
component
that
the
courts
cannot
ignore
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh
yes.
oh
yes
and
the
--
the
board
of
managers
have
joined
all
the
heirs.
they're
all
in
the
case
now,
seven
of
them
–
individually,
some
individually
some
as
trustees.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
mr.
justice
black
forget
it
but
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
think
that
an
issue
appear
as
in
the
case
at
least
this
time
but
my
response
to
the
question,
if
it
were
to
arise
would
be
that
we
have
several
provisions
of
senator
bacon's
will
which
are
irreconcilable.
we
have
on
the
one
hand
a
trusteeship
by
the
city
and
the
other
hand
racial
segregation,
that
is
irreconcilable.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
in
his
will
set
forth
quite
explicitly
and
on
repeated
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
he
desired
this
to
be
a
park
in
perpetuity
and
forever,
and
for
all
time
and
used
that
again
and
again
and
again
and
he
also
wanted
the
racial
segregation
and
if
the
court
were
faced
with
the
choice
between
following
either
one
statement
of
what
the
world
will
desire
to
accomplish
or
another
that
is
keep
a
park
in
perpetuity
or
maintain
racial
segregation,
and
the
court
chose
racial
segregation,
it
will
closed
down
the
park
because
racial
segregation
could
not
be
maintained,
then
we
would
say
that
would
be
a
choice
forbidden
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
city
could
take
it
without
paying
for
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
would
--
we
would
claim
that
the
--
i'm
not
quite
certain
that
i
understand
the
question
but
we
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
that
--
my
first
answer
to
it
would
be
that
where
we
are
faced
with
an
alternative
between
maintaining
a
park
in
perpetuity
which
is
quite
explicit
about
in
this
will,
and
a
racial
factor
which
we
claim
should
be
just
in
view
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
a
sense
obliterated
from
the
will
that
if
the
court
is
faced
with
two
alternatives
and
choosing
one
or
the
other,
the
court
should
choose
for
maintaining
the
park
in
perpetuity
and
not
divest
the
park
from
the
trustees
in
order
to
satisfy
a
racial
condition.
but
beyond
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
an
interpretation
law
mr.
justice
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it's
quite
clear
and
(voice
overlap)
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
precisely
my
point,
and
the
point
is
that
that
to
choose
one
of
these
two
irreconcilable
statements
of
intention
(voice
overlap)
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
city
could
but
i
don't
get
that's
a
question
that
is
presented
at
all
here.
beyond
which
senator
bacon
said
this
one
as
a
charitable
trust
than
i
plan
to
come
later
in
the
argument.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
heir
--
the
heirs
of
the
parties
and
the
heirs,
i
thought
i
made
clear
that
the
heirs
did
say
that
if
the
racial
desire
of
the
testator
could
not
be
fulfilled
than
this
park
would
revert
to
the
heirs.
yes,
i
--
i'm
uncertain
that
i
said
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i'm
not
certain
that
the
issue
was
here
at
this
point
in
the
case
because
at
this
point
what
we're
doing
is
appealing
from
a
judgment,
which
substituted
the
trustees
and
the
question
then
is
whether
we
will
affirm
that
judgment
permitting
the
trustees
to
stay
in
or
reverse
that
judgment
and
there
was
--
there
is
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
if
you
were
to
reverse
the
judgment
the
case
would
then
go
back
into
status
quo
as
it
was
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
lawsuit
because
we
then
have
the
city
as
trustee,
and
the
city
has
recognized
it
sobligation
not
to
exclude
negroes
in
the
park,
and
the
lawsuit
precipitated
by
the
black
and
the
city
permitted
negroes
to
come
in
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
the
heirs
could
come
in
and
make
it.
the
answer
to
that
claim
is
what
i
suggest
that
it
should
be.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
the
georgia
courts
rejected
a
claim
about
the
cy
pres
doctrine
and
we
don't
press
that
in
terms
of
that
particular
doctrine
of
trust
law.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
believe
that
immediately
property
can
go
back
to
the
heirs.
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
that
but
i
believe
there
is
constitutional
inhibition
against
that
happening,
but
i
don't
believe
that
it
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
say
the
property
went
back
to
the
heirs
because
the
court
chose
to
--
the
court
chose
to
enforce
racial
segregation,
were
not
to
permit
racial
integration
as
against
the
statement
under
the
will
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
what
the
court
say
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it's
our
position
if
the
court
said
that
they
can't
operate
it
as
a
park
because
they
must
racially
integrate
it
and
--
and
they
made
that
choice
as
--
and
they
base
that
upon
the
--
the
intention
of
the
desire
of
the
testator.
mr.
jack
greenberg
but
we
would
submit
that
it
would
be
our
argument
if
and
when
that
question
arose,
if
the
trust
could
not
be
held
to
fail
for
this
racial
reason
that's
what
we
would
--
that's
what
we
use
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i
say
it
would
be
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
the
georgia
court
has
not
ruled
on
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
say
they
could
put
in
their
claim.
this
point
is
not
--
has
not
been
fully
litigated
and
it's
not
before
the
court
but
if
the
point
arose
our
position
would
be
as
stated
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
and
i
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
that
would
--
that
i
think
it's
premature
at
this
point
but
i
--
i'm
maybe
mistaken
but
i
would
least
submit
that
i
have
no
doubt
as
to
what
would
be
applicable
law
could
be.
if
i'm
proven
wrong
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that
would
be
our
argument.
that
would
be
our
argument.
i'd
like
to
say
another
word
about
69-504
that
if
quite
a
part
in
the
law
of
trust
and
dedication,
you
take
a
look
at
this
statute
of
its
own
force,
any
careful
testator
planning
to
set
up
a
trust
for
a
large
and
valuable
piece
of
property
would
have
serious
doubts
as
to
whether
he
could
do
anything
other
than
what
statute
provided.
the
holding
in
the
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
50
years
later
that
69-504
means
that
one
may
set
up
a
segregated
or
a
non-segregated
park,
that's
how
they
interpret
it
now,
cannot
retrospectively
alter
the
situation
which
any
thoughtful
lawyer
would
have
faced
upon
reading
the
plain
language
in
1911,
and
that
was
--
at
that
time
you
may
set
up
such
a
park
for
white
people
only
or
for
colored
people
only,
for
any
other
race
only.
and
given
the
statute
and
any
thoughtful
lawyer
would
have
thought
it
prudent
to
stay
within
the
law.
now,
there's
language
in
law
that
they
make
much
of
in
the
respondent's
brief,
stating
senator
bacon's
feeling
about
racial
separation.
he
states
that
he
feels
that
racial
segregation
is
the
right
thing
and
while
there
is
certainly
no
reason
could
doubt
that
this
is
the
way
he
felt,
i
think
all
of
us
have
encountered
the
method
of
reasoning
which
consists
of
stating
a
conclusion
first
in
summoning
up
support
for
it
afterwards.
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
good
senator
having
been
persuaded
and
influenced
by
the
statute,
then
recited
the
language
about
this
personal
abuse
on
racial
separation
that
falls
through
the
law.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
he
was.
he
was
veteran
in
the
confederate
army
and
he
was
a
senator
here
in
washington
for
20
years.
mr.
jack
greenberg
actually
he
was
the
chairman
of
foreign
relations
committee
for
a
year.
but
it's
entirely
possible
and
the
lawyer
said,
“look
senator,
you
can't
do
it
this
way.
you'd
have
to
have
a
non-segregated
park
or
no
park
at
all,”
he
might
have
said,
“well,
you
know,
i'd
really
like
it
to
have
it
segregated
but
i'd
rather
have
a
park.”
we
just
don't
know.
when
we
have
the
ingredient
of
the
statute
in
the
case
that
so
infects
the
whole
situation
that
we
claim
that
under
fourteenth
amendment
that
this
can't
be
held
to
be
a
unilateral
choice
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
peterson.
mr.
jack
greenberg
and
anderson
against
martin
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
perhaps
robinson
would
be
even
closer
but
as
peterson
compelled
the
segregation
and
robinson
merely
made
that
somewhat
more
profitable
those
segregated
restaurant
case.
and
--
while
in
those
cases
i
imagine
in
the
theory
it
might
have
been
possible
to
put
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
a
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
those
two
cases
are
about
special
situations
of
special
types
of
the
general
example
as
exemplified
in
the
anderson
against
martin
or
naacp
against
alabama,
a
combination
of
state
and
private
action
bringing
about
an
unconstitutional
racial
result.
mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
something
which
was
touched
upon
in
the
various
arguments
following
mine
and
that
is
there's
an
aspect
of
this
case
that
is
overlooked
when
people
talk
about
whether
a
private
individual
can
segregate
on
his
property
or
even
can
a
private
trust
segregate
or
even
can
a
--
ones
heirs
be
required
to
segregate
and
that
is
the
aspect
of
perpetuity.
this
charitable
trust
has
been
endowed
by
the
state
of
georgia
with
a
quality
that
private
property
transactions
normally
don't
possess.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
passed
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
the
nation
has
acquiesced
in
this
and
has
endorsed
it
and
then
there
has
been
the
civil
rights
act
of
1965
and
i
imagine
the
time
that
will
not
be
far
from
now
in
the
state
of
georgia
and
the
city
of
macon
may
have
comparable
legislation
and
indeed
may
have
a
comparable
spirit
among
the
people
which
won't
require
any
legislation.
and
if
this
were
a
private
property
transaction
or
these
merely
were
a
private
trust
in
time,
the
dead-hand
of
the
testator
would
be
removed
from
it
and
people
would
change
their
minds
and
local
and
national
laws
perhaps
could
be
able
to
affect
it.
but
we
have
here
a
situation
in
which
when
everything
else
has
changed
in
the
city
of
macon
both
in
law
and
in
the
hearts
of
the
people,
the
dead-hand
of
this
testator
will
remain
in
baconsfield
if
the
contentions
of
the
respondents
are
right
will
forever
remain
a
segregated
park
ultimately
by
operation
of
the
law
of
charitable
trust
of
the
state
of
georgia.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
no
this
would
--
this
--
this
--
this
would.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
to
the
extent
that
--
that
any
of
the
state
would
enforce
as
yes.
but
the
point
i've
been
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
--
that
is
correct.
but
when
we
get
for
the
racial
aspect
of
it,
we
would
submit
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
supersedes
that
and
various
state
constitutions
might
superseded
as
well
so
far
as
a
racial
restriction
being
enforced
by
the
state
through
the
law
of
charitable
trust.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
of
course
that
type
of
question
arises
time
and
time
again
in
cases
in
which
an
objection
is
made
to
racial
segregation
being
enforced
in
some
sense
by
the
state.
and
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
of
course
is
what
was
stated
in
the
slaughter
house
cases
and
elsewhere
that
the
primary
and
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
to
strike
down
racial
discrimination
and
while
of
course
it
radiates
elsewhere
and
deals
with
other
things
different
questions
of
reasonableness
in
degree
and
countervailing
considerations
are
taken
into
effect,
but
when
we're
dealing
with
race
and
the
state
has
its
hand
and
its
out
that
would
be
my
answer
to
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
i
would
say
that's
correct,
but
of
course
then
we
get
to
the
religious
cases
and
i
certainly
don't
want
to
get
into
that
problem.
but
different
considerations
are
then
taken
into
account
when
you
deal
with
those
other
kinds
of
problems.
this
of
course
is
--
is
not
merely
a
question
of
the
charitable
trust
because
here
we
were
faced
with
the
situation
in
which
the
senator
had
two
incompatible
irreconcilable
desires
set
forth
in
his
will.
on
the
one
hand,
he
wanted
public
trusteeship
and
that
was
very
clear,
that
was
just
not
a
fleeting
thought
that
he
had
and
said,
gee,
you
know,
perhaps
we
ought
to
have
a
public
trustee.
he
set
this
forth
a
number
of
times
as
to
the
realty,
as
to
the
personality
and
then
if
the
city
by
its
charter
and
he
had
this
in
mind,
fit
the
city
by
a
charter
or
unable
to
serve
the
city
would
then
appoint
the
private
trustee
or
some
other
trustee
and
then
not
merely
appoint
it
but
the
city
council
who
laid
down
rules
and
regulations
under
which
this
new
trustee
would
function,
so
public
control
is
a
matter
of
very
great
concern
to
him.
and
if
on
the
one
hand
we
have
this
deep
interest
in
public
control
and
in
the
other
hand
we
have
this
deep
concern
for
racial
segregation,
the
court
was
not
enforcing
the
private
will
of
the
testator,
it
was
making
a
choice
between
two
incompatible
wills
and
that
was
the
action
of
the
court.
this
is
quite
unlike
shelley
against
kraemer
where
there
was
just
a
single
univalent
will
of
a
--
of
a
--
of
a
property
owner.
this
was
a
case
in
which
there
were
two
incompatible
wills
and
indeed
the
will
to
segregate
was
infected
by
the
state
action
legislation
that
section
69-504
that
i
talked
about
a
great
deal
yesterday.
so
how
this
can
be
viewed
as
a
simple,
private
property
matter
in
which
a
living
person
does
something
with
the
part
of
land
that
he
owns
during
his
lifetime
without
regard
to
the
state
either
controlling
it
forever
into
all
time
or
without
regard
to
the
state
influencing
him
or
selecting
racial
segregation
as
against
another
equally
strongly
expressed
desire
escapes
to
me.
this
is
a
question
of
state
action
from
beginning
to
end.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
the
court
made
a
choice
--
the
court
made
a
choice
between
two
incompatible
desires
and
the
desire
to
segregate
cannot
as
a
matter
of
law
be
considered
as
a
personal
desire
merely
stemming
out
of
his
own
heart
and
mind.
it
was
infected
by
section
69-504
which
would
have
influenced
any
careful
lawyer
to
set
up
the
will
in
this
kind
of
way
and
perhaps
even
encourage
bacon
to
make
this
kind
of
will.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
--
we
ague
that
but
we
--
we
have
to
realize
we're
standing
here
and
they
were
writing
the
will
way
back
there.
in
any
event
that
the
minimum
that
influenced
him
to
write
it
but
our
appraisal
of
the
law
then
is
that
but
for
the
law,
he
couldn't
have
done
it,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
no.
we've
been
unable
to
find
any,
our
opponents
haven't
suggested
any
that
you
could
set
up
a
will
either
by
dedication
or
by
trust
or
rather
a
part
by
dedication
and
trust
and
in
any
event,
but
for
the
statute
he
could
not
have
set
--
set
up
this
kind
of
will.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
i
state
that
not
merely
in
a
formal
stance,
but
the
judgment
below
is
the
judgment
that
excepted
the
resignation
of
the
city
as
a
trustee
if
that
were
reversed,
we
would
be
in
a
situation
which
the
constitution
would
be
satisfied
and
the
intervenors
would
be
able
to
freely
use
the
court
in
accordance
with
the
constitution.
