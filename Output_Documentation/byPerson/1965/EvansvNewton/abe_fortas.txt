justice
abe
fortas
mr.
claiborne,
if
i
correctly
understand
your
position,
you're
asking
for
a
relief
beyond
that
that
the
petitioner
is
asking
here
and
you're
really
asking
for
a
relief
which
would
in
effect
invalidate
the
racial
restriction
in
the
will?
justice
abe
fortas
well
perhaps
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
perhaps
i
misunderstood,
mr.
greenberg
yesterday
but
as
i
listened
to
him,
i
thought
that
his
position
was
that
what
this
court
--
he
was
asking
this
court
to
invalidate
the
city's
resignation
and
the
appointment
of
private
trustees.
perhaps,
i
was
wrong
about
it.
now
as
i
understand
it,
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
is
--
goes
far
beyond
that
and
to
decide
that
the
park
cannot
be
operated
on
a
discriminatory
basis.
and
the
question
that
i'm
asking
you
is
whether
the
net
affect
of
that
is
not
to
invalidate
the
racial
covenant
in
the
will
which
would
mean
perhaps
i'd
like
to
comment
on
this
that
the
question
of
a
reversion
of
a
property
to
the
heirs
would
be
academic
because
the
net
effect
would
be
that
the
racial
covenant
would
be
invalidated
and
therefore,
it
would
perhaps
--
the
result
would
be
that
there
would
be
no
reason,
no
occasion,
no
basis
for
a
reversion
of
the
property.
justice
abe
fortas
but
how
do
you
make
on
a
public
park
that
that
reverts
to
the
heirs,
that
is
to
say
aren't
those
--
isn't
that
essentially
contradictory
--
you'd
have
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
illuminate
--
what
you
mean
by
public
parks
so
far
as
i'm
concerned?
justice
abe
fortas
well
what
you're
doing
is
suggesting
a
different
form
of
words
but
essentially
the
same
result
is
that
--
is
that
wrong,
that
is
to
say
that
the
net
effect
of
the
relief
that
i
understood
mr.
greenberg
would
be
asking
was
that
the
effort
by
the
city
to
convert
this
into
some
sort
of
a
privately
managed
park
would
be
invalidated.
then
it
would
be
up
to
the
state
court
to
determine
whether
that
invalidates
the
request
to
advice
in
the
will.
and
then
the
court
would
have
to
determine
whether
it
reverts
to
the
private
persons
and
the
private
heirs.
and
as
i
understand
you
now,
you're
saying
exactly
the
same
thing.
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
hope
you'll
forgive
for
taking
so
much
of
your
time
but
what
is
the
trouble
with
the
--
that
you
have
with
the
direct
approach
or
what
seems
to
the
petitioner
at
any
rate
i
assume
would
be
the
direct
approach,
that
is
to
say
that
the
--
just
to
this
court
to
consider
holding
that
a
city
is
attempting
to
evade
a
constitutional
duty,
the
constitutional
duty
being
to
operate
this
public
facility
on
a
–
on
a
non-segregated
basis.
of
course,
there
are
a
lot
of
problems
implicit
in
that
but
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
was
the
representation
that
they
were
making
to
this
court
as
appropriate
relief.
i
take
it
that
you
have
some
questions
as
to
the
power
of
this
court
to
do
that?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
claiborne,
i
thought
that
your
position
was
that
this
was
fairly
clear
situation
here
in
terms
of
both
the
governmental
and
the
public
function
that
the
testator
intended
for
this
park
to
have
that
is
to
say
the
fact
that
he
left
it
to
the
mayor
and
council
of
the
city.
he
did
not
leave
it
to
private
trustees.
number
one
and
two
that
the
intended
benefit
went
to
all
--
to
all
white
people
of
the
city
of
macon
so
that
you
had
those
two
aspects
of
the
testator's
intention
and
therefore,
no
matter
how
you
define
it
for
purposes
of
close
cases,
i
thought
it
was
your
position
that
this
was
a
clear
case
involving
both
governmental
and
public
aspects.
am
i
correctly
stating
it?
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you
whether
you
construe
the
words
successors
there
in
the
will
to
mean
their
successors
in
those
offices.
in
other
words
as
i've
read
this
and
perhaps
i'm
wrong,
as
i
read
this
it's
not
only
the
initial
board
of
managers,
but
the
subsequent
boards
were
to
be
appointed
by
the
mayor
and
the
city
council.
and
when
the
will
refers
to
their
successors
that
is
to
say
the
successors
of
the
mayor
and
the
city
council,
it
meant
the
people
holding
those
official
positions.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
actually
happened?
has
there
been
time
enough
to
know
whether
the
mayor
and
the
city
councils
and
successive
of
mayors
and
(voice
overlap)
justice
abe
fortas
and
successor
mayors
and
city
councils
have
exercised
that
power?
justice
abe
fortas
i
want
to
ask
this
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
happened
with
[inaudible]
justice
abe
fortas
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
has
happened
is
successors
to
the
original
mayor
and
city
council
made
appointments.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
in
practical
effect,
the
construction
of
this
will
has
been
that
the
appointment
of
the
board
of
managers
has
been
made
by
those
persons
and
from
time
to
time
have
held
the
positions
of
mayor
and
city
council.
justice
abe
fortas
i
wasn't
suggesting
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
may
suggest
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
jones,
as
i
read
the
will,
there
is
also
some
bonds
--
there
were
also
some
bonds
that
were
not
by
senator
bacon
to
the
mayor
and
council.
the
income
of
those
bonds
has
been
used
for
the
maintenance
of
this
property,
isn't
that
true?
justice
abe
fortas
to
be
used
for
the
park.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
jones,
as
the
record
show
of
what
the
income
is
from
this
trust
for
the
purposes
of
maintaining
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
--
anything
on
the
property
that
indicates
that
senator
bacon
was
the
original
benefactor
of
this
property?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
jones,
as
the
record
set
forth
what
this
marker
says,
you
referred
to
the
bronze
marker
--
justice
abe
fortas
if
you
stopped
when
you
were
reciting
it
that
says
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
know
it.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
was
just
wondering
of
course
whether
the
marker
said
that
senator
bacon
had
left
it
to
the
city
–
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
what
--
what
--
what
--
what
does
that
mean?
georgia
--
georgia
supreme
court
decided
what?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
jones
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you
stated
that
will,
item
nine
authorizes
the
mayor
and
the
city
council
to
appoint
another
trustee
if
they
could
not
serve?
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
that's
a
misprint
in
this
record,
but
are
you
reading
from
the
record
on
the
file?
justice
abe
fortas
it
seems
to
me
it
didn't
complete
the
sentence
from
here.
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
i
see.
i
was
looking
further
down.
justice
abe
fortas
but
does
that
provision
refer
to
the
land
itself
to
be
held
as
a
part
or
just
to
the
front
from
the
[inaudible]
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
in
item
10?
