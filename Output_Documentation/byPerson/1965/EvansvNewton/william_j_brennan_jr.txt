was
this
the
board's
only
job,
to
carryout
this
particular
trust
--
yes,
and
was
it
appointed
to
the
authority
of
--
what
was
the
sole
device
or
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
were
provisions
made
in
the
will
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
the
appointments
to
the
board
should
be
by
the
city?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
in
the
will?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
the
weeks
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
bearing
it
will
have
on
positions
with
or
the
dismissal
be
appealing
to
all
circuit
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
pretty
much
the
same
thing
happened
there
as
it
happened
here,
does
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
second
go
round,
we'll
give
you
a
call
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we
do
deny
cert
also
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
there
was
any
difference
between
the
denial
of
cert
and
the
dismissal
and
it's
probably
the
same
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
then
mr.
--
that
the
[inaudible]
said
this
was
a
not
charitable
premise.
that
under
--
it
did
not
–
the
superior
court
said
that
under
georgia
law
that
[inaudible]
couldn't
be
applied,
there's
no
general
charitable
purpose
expressed
in
the
will.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
does
bear
i
should
think
under
colloquy
of
mr.
justice
black.
if
that's
state
law,
and
this
can't
be
satisfied,
well,
then
does
that
or
doesn't
it
mean
that
the
property
has
to
go
back
to
the
heirs.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
an
argument
mr.
greenberg
i
think
you
--
what's
that
--
what's
the
name
of
that
case
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
peterson.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
that
this
statute
has
the
same
effect
of
an
ordinance
required
segregation
of
the
restaurant
that
they
--
the
restaurant
owner,
well
it's
not
to
be
heard
to
say
that
he
didn't
segregate
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
complies
to
the
statute.
you're
saying
senator
bacon
couldn't
be
heard
to
say
or
anyone
speaking
for
him
that
he
did
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
act
within
the
compulsion
of
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
some
kind
of
difference
between
what
i
may
--
to
whom
i
might
device
my
property
and
whether
or
not
i
can
run
my
business?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
devising
my
business
and
running
it
on
a
[inaudible]
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
claiborne
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
that
mr.
claiborne,
do
you
find
anything
in
our
action
the
second
time
in
the
girard
college
case?
the
question
begins
with
the
position
that
you
take.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
jones,
i
take
it
that
there
are
expenses
of
maintenance
of
the
park?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
where
--
what
funds?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
property
other
than
the
park?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
even
this
for
general
municipal
funds
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
those
–
without
regard
to
race,
any
person
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right
or
wrong,
well
i
gather
the
--
this
means
that
if
they're
negroes
they
can
cross
on
the
roads
to
it
(voice
overlap)
it
out
and
search
them
wrong.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
was
thinking
mr.
jones,
the
property
is
tax
exempt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tax
exempt
in
what
category
of
exemption?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
public
charity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
as
municipally
owned
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
may
i
ask
mr.
jones
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
same
question
i
asked
other
jones.
what
significance
will
you
give
to
our
actions
in
the
second
girard?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
ordinarily,
our
cases
have
suggested
that
the
denial
of
certiorari
really
--
if
it
doesn't
mean
precisely
nothing
at
least
it
doesn't
mean
necessarily
or
it's
all
approval
of
the
decision
which
we
refuse
to
review,
but
we
have
here
the
complication
that
there
was
a
dismissal
except
what
i
have
suggested
the
significance
with
the
denial
of
certiorari.
what
about
the
significance
of
the
