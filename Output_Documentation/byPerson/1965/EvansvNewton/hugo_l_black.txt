justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
mr.
greenberg,
suppose
you're
right
on
that,
it
couldn't
be
operated
as
a
public
park
with
those
provisions.
is
that
in
this
case
--
or
any
--
were
the
heirs
of
senator
bacon
made
a
party
here
to
this
matter?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
under
the
law
of
georgia
or
could
it
be
the
law
of
georgia
that
said
that
the
provisions
under
which
the
park
is
given
to
the
city
cannot
be
fulfilled
property
the
[inaudible]
to
the
heirs
was
--
because
this
man
then
gave
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
definitely,
but
is
there
any
question
here
to
be
discussed
to
limit
and
simply
take
it
because
the
conditions
cannot
be
fulfilled.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
say
that
even
if
the
heirs
would
have
make
a
claim
to
the
property,
the
state
of
georgia
will
hold
this
property,
[inaudible]
because
the
conditions
have
not
been
fulfilled,
the
city
could
then
take
it
without
paying
for
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
or
somebody
when
we
use
it
for
public
park.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
was
talking
about
is
your
rule
is
--
most
everywhere
else
i
thought
that
when
a
property
is
given
for
public
purposes,
certain
conditions
--
and
the
conditions
cannot
be
fulfilled,
the
property
is
reverted
to
the
persons.
suppose
senator
bacon
was
living,
it's
been
five
years
after
he
had
given
it
this
way,
could
his
property
have
been
taken,
will
that
then
impart
although
the
conditions
were
not
fulfilled?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
what
you're
saying
is,
is
that
the
interpretation
of
the
will.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
far
as
you
--
again,
it
would
be
right
because
you
said
if
they
were
faced
with
this
situation
then
they
should
all
would,
he
intended
it
could
be
done
in
perpetuity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
were
also
intended
[inaudible]
have
done
only,
didn't
he,
i
think
it
was
upraised
in
the
same
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
they're
irreconcilable,
could
not
the
court
--
could
not
the
city
to
most
impart
the
limit,
favor?
that's
a
constitutional
provision
also?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
heirs
were
parties
and
didn't
raise
that
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
the
issue
is
here,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
reason
i've
had
the
question
to
what
it
meant
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
your
judgment
it
will
cut
out
the
heirs
from
making
that
claim,
that
the
property
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
constitutional
provision
against
that
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
might
not
choose
to
do
that.
suppose
the
court
says,
“yes,
this
is
all
bad.
the
city
can't
operate
it
as
a
park.”
now,
what
constitutional
provision
would
it
bother
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
them
and
say
that
the
law
of
georgia
is
the
ground
for
us
and
we
want
it,
but
we
certainly
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
not
be
--
it
would
be
based
on
the
fact
in
the
debate,
it
may
not
be
right.
i'm
telling
you
it's
the
problem
--
a
problem
in
my
mind
be
based
on
the
fact
that
this
property
is
in
georgia,
will
is
in
georgia.
usually
the
state
law
controls.
they
could
say
that
trustees
fail.
considerations
can
no
longer
be
done,
and
therefore,
under
the
law
of
georgia
it
belong
to
the
heirs.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
would
--
you're
telling
us
now
that
we
reverse
this
case
on
the
ground
that
this
is
bad
rather
it's
constitutional
to
use
it
this
way.
are
you
saying
that
heirs
would
not
then
be
foreclosed
in
putting
on
that
claim
to
the
--
to
the
property,
to
heirs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
thought
that
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
you're
position
here
is
that
we
would
not
adjudicate
this
by
reversing
this
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
[inaudible]
to
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
those
who
had
been
set
up
as
self-perpetuating
board
such
as
[inaudible]
what
would
you
say
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
argument
here
that's
been
in
park,
infringes
on
the
holding
in
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
basic
into
saying
things
to
how
long
--
i'm
not
saying
whether
dartmouth
college
was
right
or
wrong,
so
how
long
would
a
man
give
his
owns
--
gives
it
away,
how
long
can
he
keep
his
control
on
that
property
through
his
heirs
or
his
chosen
representatives?
isn't
that
about
what
this
case
involved?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
they
were
valid
when
made
but
later
on
they
want
to
make
it
invalid.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
had
made
his
--
his
trustee
his
heir
from
time
to
time,
they
would
have
a
remedy.
he
just
decided
that
he
want
to
leave
his
family
with
the
power
to
run
this
place,
own
it
and
run
it
and
he
hope
he'd
run
it
for
the
last
of
it
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
they
lose
their
property
if
it
had
been
conveyed
in
that
way
if
they
didn't
operate
it
as
the
state
said
they
should
operate
it?
could
the
state
penalize
it
and
take
it
without
being
involved?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
affect
the
constitutionality
of
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
we
not
--
do
we
not
find
against
that
really,
this
case
to
the
question
of
whether
in
our
private
ownership
system,
we
won't
allow
people
of
one
generation
who
own
that
property,
control
its
disposition
thereafter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
the
school
is
restricted
to
a
member
of
one
pretending
to
be
owner,
or
one
religious
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
--
has
this
park
not
been
operated
just
the
same
as
the
city
would
run
a
park?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
managers,
who
were
the
managers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you?
maybe
you
have
to
go
outside
of
the
record.
did
you
say
that
park
had
100
acres?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
said
it
was
taken,
how
was
it
taken?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
consented.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
did
it
pay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
must
be
this
other
40
acres
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
just
an
ordinary
park
with
trees
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
have
a
playground.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
has?
justice
hugo
l.
black
tennis
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
would
conceded
i'm
sure
that
the
city
owned
this
and
runs
it,
[inaudible]
to
the
city
operating
it
as
the
park,
you
could
not
possibly
constitutionally
exclude
colored
people
from
this,
would
you
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
couldn't
do
it
by
any
substitute,
probably
it's
the
same
trust.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
even
if
the
city
doesn't
know
it.
it's
owned
by
a
private
owner
if
it's
utilized
as
a
park
so
as
to
make
it
what
it
is
something
like
the
marsh
case.
they
just
used
there
--
they've
got
the
highways
and
everything
else
that
so
long
as
you
operate
it
as
a
park,
you
couldn't
exclude
colored
people
–
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
suppose
it
has
a
street
going
through
it
and
the
city
simply
lets
them
have
the
naked
title
but
the
city
has
--
does
everything
else,
supplies
it
like
it
supply
any
other
part
of
the
city.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
it.
i'm
trying
to
get
what
your
issue
really
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
that
part
of
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
might
certainly
know
that
nothing
else,
just
pure
naked
ownership
and
somebody
else
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
not
enough
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
let
that
owner
defy
people
of
constitutional
right
in
connection
with
that
topic?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
by
calling
it,
but
they
could
by
the
way
it
functioned
--
