mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
begin
at
the
end
and
say
a
word
first
about
the
appropriate
remedy
as
we
view
it
in
this
case.
for
our
part,
we
have
some
doubt
whether
this
court
may
properly
require
the
georgia
courts
to
refuse
to
accept
the
resignation
of
the
city
and
to
enjoin
those
courts
from
appointing
substitute
trustees.
the
appropriate
ruling
here,
we
think
is
the
baconsfield
so
long
as
it
remains
essentially
a
public
park
and
no
matter
who
the
trustee
is,
no
matter
who
the
board
manages
maybe
cannot
exclude
negroes
as
such
consistently
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
that
is
not
a
request
for
an
advisory
opinion.
all
the
pleadings
in
this
case
and
the
rulings
of
the
georgia
courts
are
expressly
premised
on
the
assumption
that
private
trustees,
unlike
the
city,
will
be
able
to
effectuate
the
test
status
discriminatory
purpose
which
the
city
admittedly
cannot
do.
accordingly,
the
appropriate
disposition
here
it
seems
to
us,
if
the
court
accepts
our
argument
on
the
merits,
is
for
the
court
to
declare
that
the
park,
no
matter
by
whom
it
ministered,
cannot
be
operated
on
a
racially
discriminatory
basis,
yo
vacate
the
judgment
below,
because
it
is
based
on
an
incorrect
premise
and
to
remand
the
case
to
the
judge
of
course,
first
affording
the
city
an
opportunity
to
withdraw
its
resignation
in
light
of
the
ruling
that
that
resignation
is
ineffective
insofar
as
it
permits
the
effectuation
of
the
trustee's
racial
restriction.
if
the
city
should
choose
not
to
withdraw
that
resignation,
then
the
remand
to
afford
the
georgia
courts
an
opportunity
to
determine
as
a
matter
of
local
law
whether
a
resignation
as
it
were
without
cause,
a
pointless
resignation,
is
or
should
be
accepted
a
new
trustee's
appointment.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
take
no
position
on
that
question.
we
do
not
think
it's
before
the
court.
we
do
not
think
the
judgment
we
suggest
would
have
any
effect
on
that
question
which
clearly
expressly
too
was
not
passed
on
by
the
judge
of
courts.
the
request
of
the
heirs
that
the
property
be
reverted
to
them
in
the
event
the
restriction
could
not
be
carried
out
was
not
ruled
on
below
and
it
seems
to
us
cannot
be
ruled
on
here.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
fortas,
in
their
pleadings
below,
the
petitioners
did
ask
that
the
racial
restriction
be
stricken.
they
also
asked
that
the
cy-pres
doctrine
be
applied
by
striking
that
racial
restriction
and
effectuating
what
they
view
is
the
primary
purpose
of
testator
retained
the
city
as
trustee.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
here
as
i
understand
it,
the
petitioners
are
at
least
alternatively
arguing
for
the
same
ruling
that
we
think
is
appropriate.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
don't
view
the
ruling
we
suggest
here
as
having
any
such
effect.
we
simply
say
that
the
court
should
declare
that
so
long
as
the
park
remains
essentially
a
public
park,
it
cannot
discriminate
on
the
ground
of
race.
we
do
not
say
that
the
heirs
have
no
right
to
reversion
if
this
condition
in
the
will
is
unenforceable.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
assume
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
will
do
that,
mr.
justice
fortas
but
as
we
view
the
reversion
to
the
heirs,
it
would
then
cease
to
be
a
property
dedicated
to
public
uses
in
perpetuity,
would
then
become
the
private
property
of
the
heirs
to
do
with
as
they
chose
to
use
for
business
purposes,
to
subdivide
as
housing
or
otherwise
to
use
it
in
nonpublic
way.
because
if
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
does
come
to
the
same
thing,
mr.
justice
fortas.
however,
we
have
--
we
simply
have
doubt
whether
the
appropriate
remedy
is
to
direct
the
georgia
courts
to
refuse
his
resignation.
for
all
we
know,
georgia
law
would
permit
the
city
to
resign
without
cause
and
if
that
is
so,
there
is
no
federal
question
involved
there.
if
on
the
other
hand
georgia
law
only
permits
a
resignation
for
cause
and
that
cause
is
constitutionally
prohibited,
then
perhaps
the
proper
solution
is
to
bar
the
substitution
of
trustees.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
agree
that
the
effort
of
the
city
to
perpetuate
segregation
through
its
resignation
if
--
if
that
should
maybe
properly
so
viewed
is
an
ingredient
in
this
case,
a
meaningful
one.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
law
of
georgia
be
that
the
city
can
resign
for
no
cause
then
it
seems
to
us
perhaps
irrelevant
that
their
clause
in
this
case
was
the
bad
one.
but
our
primary
point
is
that
a
public
park,
no
matter
by
whom
operated
cannot
stand
consistently
with
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
racial
restriction
in
such
park
cannot
stand
consistently
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
depends
on
how
one
defines
the
private
park
suppose
as
a
public
park.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
the
ingredient
which
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it
is
true,
mr.
justice
stewart
but
the
more
limited
the
class
of
beneficiaries
in
terms
of
age,
in
terms
of
minority,
the
less
public
the
facility
and
therefore
the
less
governmental
the
function
being
exercised.
the
less
effect
or
impact
the
discrimination
will
have
on
the
community
as
a
whole
and
the
less
the
fourteenth
amendment
command
applies
to
that
park.
here
we
have
essentially
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
sir.
i
would
say
that
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
at
all
has
to
be
determined
by
looking
at
the
character
of
the
facility,
the
admissions
policy
whether
it
is
generally
open
to
the
public
and
excludes
only
a
very
limited
class
or
rather
whether
it
is
designed
to
benefit
of
a
small
class
and
excludes
the
public
at
large.
that
that
determination
comes
first
and
decides
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
command
is
applicable.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
considerations
which
lead
to
that
result,
it
seems
to
me
are
in
large
part
determined
by
the
class
of
beneficiaries,
the
size
of
the
class
of
beneficiaries,
the
nature
of
the
facility
involved,
the
impact
of
the
discrimination,
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
think
that
necessarily
follows.
one
ingredient
is
certainly
the
class
of
beneficiaries
who
enjoy
the
facility.
if
this
is
the
public
as
a
whole,
that
is
one
ingredient
in
making
the
facility
a
public
quasi
governmental
facilities.
but
there
are
other
important
critical
factors,
and
certainly,
the
character
of
the
facility,
the
fact
that
this
is
a
park
and
not
a
business.
the
fact
that
it
is
a
large
park
said
to
be
located
in
the
city
is
relevant.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
the
fact
that
it
is
free
of
course
is
relevant,
that
it
is
dedicated
to
public
use.
if
it's
a
free
school,
it
comes
close
to
this
case.
if
it's
a
school
that
has
an
admissions
policy
which
charges
tuition,
which
necessarily
has
a
limited
category
of
beneficiaries,
then
it
may
fall
in
the
private
area
rather
than
the
public
sector.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
a
church
very
plainly
is
not
covered
by
our
argument.
there
are
several
reasons
for
that.
first,
the
church
does
have
a
limited
class
as
beneficiaries.
it
is
by
definition
for
one
sect
and
not
for
the
public
at
large.
secondly,
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
because
there
is
also
the
fact
that
this
in
no
sense
can
be
viewed
as
the
discharge
of
a
governmental
function.
it's
not
the
business
and
cannot
be
the
business
of
government
to
establish
and
operate
churches.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
an
ingredient
in
our
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
park
is
very
plainly,
performing
a
governmental
function.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
essential
in
our
analysis.
here
we
have
a
public
park.
most
parks
are,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
state
or
municipally
owned.
private
parks
as
oppose
to
country
clubs
are
very
much
the
exception.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
speak
with
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
want
to
pretend
to
resolve
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
want
to
pretend
to
resolve
all
of
those
cases.
i
would
say
that
the
hospital
case
is
perhaps
one
closer
to
this
one.
hospitals
do
perform
an
important
public
function
which
is
traditionally
at
least
today
performed
by
government,
by
municipalities.
an
orphanage
may
fall
into
the
same
category
though
it
has
the
more
limited
membership.
another
ingredient
in
our
case
is
the
importance
of
countervailing
elements
of
privacy
--
of
private
choice
of
association
where
the
relationship
between
the
beneficiaries
has
some
element
of
--
which
may
properly
be
left
to
private
choice.
some
ingredient
of
a
long
lasting
intimate
relationship
such
as
perhaps
an
old
folk's
home,
one
can
more
easily
understand
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
not
meant
to
follow
that
sort
of
choice
of
association.
but
here
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
a
close
case,
mr.
justice
stewart.
again
the
category
of
beneficiaries
is
very
limited.
it
doesn't
pretend
to
be
a
facility
open
to
the
general
public.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
as
this
case
goes
so
might
go
the
girard
college
case
which
was
open
at
least
to
all
orphans
within
the
city
except
negroes.
within
the
class,
at
least,
there
was
a
broad
invitation
to
the
public
and
i
do
think
it's
crucial
that
this
is
a
charitable
institution
that
is
one
that
charges
no
admission.
the
private
college
or
the
private
facility
which
has
either
a
restricted
admission's
policy
or
the
charged
with
(voice
overlap)
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
primary
dominant
characteristic
of
this
park
is
that
it's
open
generally
without
any
discrimination
to
all
the
residents
for
that
matter
to
nonresidents
to
the
city
of
macon.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
assume
that
in
macon,
the
white
race
predominates
and
that
therefore,
they
cons
--
they
constitute
majority
of
the
community.
in
any
event,
the
park
does
not
discriminate
on
any
other
basis.
the
discrimination
on
account
of
race
has
no
legitimate
justification
here
in
terms
of
the
proprietor's
interest
in
selecting
those
who
will
use
park
or
in
terms
of
any
long
lasting
and
meaningful
association
between
the
persons
who
use
the
park.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
entirely
true,
mr.
justice
fortas.
here
it
is
relevant
that
first
that
georgia
provided
that
such
trust
users
be
administered
by
the
city,
that
senator
bacon
quite
naturally
chose
the
city
as
his
trustee
which
is
normal
for
a
park,
normally
in
municipal
operation.
it
is
equally
relevant
that
the
city
of
macon
did
for
50
years
administer
this
park
as
a
municipal
park.
and
of
course,
it's
relevant
that
the
city
during
that
administration
did
impose
a
racial
restriction
which
is
now
thought
to
be
perpetuated
by
quasi
public
--
quasi
private
board.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
is
at
least
one
meaningful
difference
between
that
case
and
this,
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
decision
by
the
now
owner
of
property
to
lend
it
temporarily
and
subject
to
his
own
ability
to
change
the
condition
to
a
public
purpose
is
different
from
a
charitable
trust
made
in
perpetuity
which
continues
long
after
the
decease
of
the
testator
and
which
is
beyond
his
ability
to
control
in
anyway
that
the
heirs
owned
this
property
and
chose
to
dedicate
it
temporarily
to
a
public
park,
they
would
retain
a
measure
to
control
over
the
right
to
sell
it,
the
right
to
restrict
it,
the
right
to
change
its
use,
and
it
would
be
less
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
they
dedicate
it
as
a
permanent
park,
then
as
a
matter
of
georgia
law
i
gather,
it
would
have
to
be
open
to
the
entire
public.
but
in
any
event
in
that
case,
it
would
become
a
full
pledge
municipal
activity.
it
would
dedicate
it
permanently,
irrevocably
dedicated
to
public
use.
it
would
be
administered
by
the
city
and
would
be
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
i
was
--
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood.
there
is
a
distinction
in
georgia
between
dedication
and
the
creation
of
this
sort
of
facility
by
a
charitable
trust.
dedication
is
viewed
as
a
complete
severance
of
claim
by
the
owner
whereas
the
trust
has
some
elements
that
retain
control,
and
some
elements
that
a
private
or
appointed
board
of
administrators.
well
the
dedicated
park
as
i
view
it
would
be
wholly
operated
by
the
municipality
and
with
all
purposes
be
viewed
as
a
municipal
park.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it
is
relevant
that
we
do
have
that
additional
ingredient
of
city
administration
and
it's
at
the
bacons
choice
of
the
city
as
trustee.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
result
would
be
different
if
those
elements
were
lacking.
but
we
do
since
we
--
since
they're
all
present
in
this
case,
i
think
they
add
to
the
stated
park
in
this
facility.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
the
board
was
self-perpetuating
should
make
little
difference,
i
should
think.
now
i
--
i
would
repeat
the
answer
i
gave
to
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
think
it
is
relevant
here
that
the
city
was
made
trustee
rather
than
a
self-perpetuating
board.
those
being
the
--
the
only
two
alternatives
i
see
or
a
board
appointed
by
the
city
but
that
would
amount
to
a
--
to
the
city.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not,
mr.
justice
black
because
dartmouth
college
was
a
wholly
different
case
involving
a
different
constitutional
provision,
the
contract
clause.
it
doesn't
follow
that
what
is
governmental
action
under
the
contract
clause
is
governmental
action
or
it's
not
governmental
action
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
isn't
but
certainly
an
important
aspect
to
this
case,
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
it
does
matter
what
sort
of
restriction
he
--
he
wants
to
impose
forever.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
they
must
be
done
in
some
instances.
and
it
--
it
would
be
strange
if
the
senator
bacon's
trust
in
this
case
is
valid
when
made.
but
which
could
not
be
made
today
would
be
perpetuated
in
macon
for
all
ages
to
come
even
when
the
city
as
we
are
told
have
desegregated
its
own
facilities,
when
the
privately
owned
places
of
public
accommodation
in
the
city
have
been
desegregated,
in
a
day
when
all
vestiges
of
the
color
line
had
gone,
if
this
provision
is
sustained
because
it
is
part
of
a
charitable
trust,
because
it
is
perpetual,
it
could
last
indefinitely.
the
law
must
have
the
remedy.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
if
that
would
merely
a
hope
and
not
a
requirement
binding
on
his
trustees,
then
they
would
be
in
the
same
position
as
present
private
owners
and
there
wouldn't
be
this
perpetual
dedication
to
the
public
which
is
attempted
to
be
binding
at
all
time.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
certainly,
i
wouldn't
--
i
would
not
think
so,
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
this
is
a
meaningful
--
meaningfully
different
case
because
it
does
involve
this
element
of
a
perpetual
dedication
to
public
use
and
one
that
is
perhaps
more
than
any
other
we
can
think
of,
a
governmental,
typically
governmental
operation
and
of
course
the
physical
characteristics
of
this
park
must
put
in
mind.
if
this
can
be
done
in
macon,
it
can
be
done
in
the
city
which
only
has
one
park
and
the
impact
of
that
exclusion
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
seems
to
me
it
should
bear
on
the
question
whether
public
parks
unlike
perhaps
other
facilities
are
susceptible
of
or
subject
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
does
matter
that
parks
are
few
in
number
and
therefore
the
impact
of
discrimination
there
is
greater.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
the
important
question
of
the
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
brennan
i
read
as
--
as
mr.
greenberg
does
the
dismissal
of
the
appeal
in
the
second
case
has
meaning
no
more
than
it
did
in
the
first,
therefore,
not
as
being
ruling
on
the
merits
and
of
course,
the
denial
of
certiorari
of
the
second
case
cannot
be
read
as
any
decision
of
the
merits.
i
would
say
that
it
may
have
been
an
element
in
the
court's
decision
to
deny
certiorari
in
second
case
that
there
was
a
pennsylvania
statute
which
apparently
though
it
was
subsequently
was
held
not
to
require
the
opening
out
of
girard
college
to
all
races.
the
case
perhaps
seemed
to
be
close
to
becoming
moot.
i
would
also
say
that
a
school,
unlike
a
park,
does
have
more
elements
of
privacy.
and
a
school
which
is
restricted
to
orphans
only
is
not
quite
as
public,
not
quite
as
available
to
the
public
at
large
as
it
is
the
large
public
park
like
baconsfield.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
becomes
a
traditional
object
of
private
philanthropy.
it
is
filling
a
need
which
government
cannot
fill
at
least
in
the
case
of
the
church.
and
is
therefore
one
which
it
does
not
stand
in
the
place
of
a
governmental
function
because
no
government
could
establish
a
school
for
one
church
only.
and
of
course
again,
the
class
of
beneficiaries
is
much
smaller
and
the
impact
of
the
exclusion
there
is
very
limited.
