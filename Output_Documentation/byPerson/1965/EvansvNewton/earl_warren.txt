chief

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
mean
by
sanitary
services,
restrooms?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
the
streets
in
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
entire
public?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this,
mr.
jones.
in
your
city
planning
in
the
--
and
particularly
in
the
planning
of
your
park
system,
was
--
was
this
considered
as
a
part
of
the
development
of
the
entire
system?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
not
zoning
but
let's
say
acquisition
--
the
acquisition
and
the
development
of
parks
for
the
--
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
as
all
cities
have.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
do
not
think
that
might
be
important?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
100-acre
park
in
the
–
in
the
city
or
anything
comparable
to
it
--
for
negroes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
has
that
been
open?
chief
justice
earl
warren
open
to
all
–
all
people
in
the
public
park.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
any
knowledge
as
to
how
much
the
(voice

for
maintaining
the
park--
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
those
things
--
even
those
things
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
course
cost
quite
a
bit
of
money
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
did
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
did
the
--
how
did
the
city
get
the
title
to
the
--
to
the
land
for
highway
purposes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
meant
they
did
it
without
the
allowed
reference
to
the
--
to
the
trustees
at
all,
just
did
it
themselves
as
the
municipal
fare.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
was
wondering
if
this
was
--
if
this
was
an
irrevocable
dedication
only
for
white
persons.
if
the
fact
that
the
--
that
the
city
many
years
ago,
i
presume,
actually
opened
to
that
for
streets
and
highways
for
the
use
of
both
blacks
and
whites
in
the
community
was
not
just
as
much
a
departure
from
the
will
as
what
is
--
what
will
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
wouldn't
that
indicate
that
this
was
a
part
of
a
--
of
their
park
system
and
used
as
such
and
considered
as
such
and
therefore
it
needed
streets
to
go
--
and
highways
to
go
through
it
for
the
--
for
the
use
of
those
who
--
who
are
using
the
park?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that
transaction
again?
i
didn't
quite
understand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
house
used
for,
mr.
jones?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
limited
to
certain
women's
groups?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jones
do
you
--
are
there
any
other
places
in
the
city
given
tax
exemption
for
women's
clubs
to
--
to
have
a
home
and
gather
and
have
lunches
and
so
forth
to
--
for
any
limited
group
not
for
the
public
generally
but
for
any
limited
group?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
certainly
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
here
you
have
a
house,
how
big
is
this
house?
chief
justice
earl
warren
here
you
have
a
house
and
you
say
about
15
acres
of
--
of
lawn
around
it
and
this
is
all
given
tax
exemption
for
an
exhibit
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
is
limited
to
--
to
the
use
of
white
women's
clubs
and
all
of
the
public
pays
the
burden
of
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
okay.
do
--
do
you
think
that
the
present
time
that
a
person
would
give
--
could
execute
a
trust
such
as
the
senator
did
and
leave
it
for
white
persons
only
and
acquire
tax
exemption
for
that
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
with
private
trustee.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
could
qualify
it
as
a
charity,
but
could
you
qualify
it
as
a
charity
where
it
was
on
for
that
purpose
only
and
have
the
streets
through
it
and
things
of
that
kind
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
doesn't
that
go
to
the
question
of
whether
this
was
used
as
a
public
facility
rather
than
whether
it
was
a
private
affair
run
by
private
trustees?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
see
no
difference.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
wouldn't
that
language
on
the
top
of
page
19
that
conflicts
with
that
a
little,
that
says
“it
is
my
will
that
all
right,
title
and
interest
in
and
to
a
said
property
herein
before
described
and
founded
both
legal
and
equitable
including
all
remainders
in
reverse
in
every
estate
in
the
same
of
whatsoever
kind
so
thereupon
passed
in
and
belong
to
the
mayor
and
council
of
the
city
of
macon
and
to
their
successors
forever.”
