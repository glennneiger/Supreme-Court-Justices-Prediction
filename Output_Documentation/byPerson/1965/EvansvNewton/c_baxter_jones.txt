mr.
c.
baxter
jones
your
honors,
i
approach
this
case,
arguing
for
the
respondent
essentially
from
the
premise
that
what
we
are
looking
for
is
what
can
fail
and
be
found
as
state
action
in
connection
with
the
facts
of
this
case
as
disclosed
by
the
record.
accordingly,
it
occurs
to
me
since
there
is
no
suggestion
made
and
certainly
no
suggestion
which
could
reasonably
be
made
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
except
in
the
event
of
an
element
of
state
involvement
that
the
critical
and
important
question
which
we
are
ultimately
trying
to
decide
is
just
where
that
state
involvement
is.
and
that
can
only
be
determined
by
a
critical,
accurate,
and
rather
complete
examination
of
the
facts
of
the
case
as
disclosed
by
the
record.
now
the
most
vital
and
in
fact
the
only
document
which
is
involved
which
does
have
the
elements
of
a
contract
is
of
course
the
will
of
senator
bacon.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
thing
i
would
like
to
approach
is
that
which
is
suggested
by
mr.
claiborne's
opening
remarks
in
which
he
places
emphasis
upon
the
fact
that
this
was
a
public
place
equating
it
i
suppose
in
some
sense
to
governmental
operations
and
i
have
assumed
that
that
contention
having
full
made
was
more
less
based
upon
inferences
that
might
be
drawn
from
the
marsh
versus
alabama
decision.
there
is
of
course
a
vital
difference
there
and
irrespective
of
marsh,
it
maybe
that
viewing
a
public
park
in
the
charitable
sense,
simply
by
itself
and
without
relation
doing
a
precedent,
it
maybe
that
this
court
would
reach
the
same
conclusion
here
that
they
did
in
marsh.
but
of
course,
the
court
is
entirely
aware
that
in
the
marsh
case,
we
were
dealing
with
a
community
which
i
believe
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
a
concurring
opinion,
stated
to
be
a
town
as
might
so
as
in
the
other
town
that
is
slangily
expressed
by
me,
a
town
is
a
town
and
that
is
that.
but
in
the
marsh
case,
the
language
in
the
majority
opinion
clearly
discloses
the
broad
ambit
of
community
life
which
was
carried
on
there
with
shops,
[inaudible]
building
run
into
the
post
office
department
were
used
by
the
united
states
government,
the
delivery
of
mail
involving
so
far
a
--
the
--
the
complete
orbit
of
community
life
as
to
constitute
it
a
governmental
operation
in
the
same
sense
that
a
town
chartered
by
the
state
would
be
so
considered.
now
getting
back
to
the
baconsfield
case
then
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
no
sir,
i
--
i
really
appreciate
that
question
because
at
an
appropriate
time,
i
was
going
take
some
exception
to
remarks
about
--
i'll
do
it
right
now.
i'd
like
to
do
it
right
now.
a
statement
has
been
made;
i
think
rather
glibly
and
a
little
bit
carelessly
that
the
city
has
administered
this
park.
the
truth
of
the
business
is
that
the
city
has
never
had
any
connection
with
this
park
of
any
sort
or
character
except
to
hold
a
legal,
naked
title
as
trustee.
the
will
in
the
most
pointed
language
provides
for
the
appointment
of
a
board
of
managers.
it
says
in
words
which
are
comprehensive
and
complete
that
the
board
of
managers
shall
have
a
complete,
the
unrestricted,
the
unrestrained,
control,
management,
maintenance
of
the
park
entirely
free
from
any
interference,
i
believe
substantially
those
words
being
used
and
the
will
set
up
funds
of
which
would
produce
an
income
to
maintain
its
operation.
now
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
the
board
of
managers
was
seven
persons
to
be
appointed
under
the
will
as
a
board
of
managers
in
the
first
instance
by
the
city
of
macon.
i
said
that
they
had
never
had
anything
to
do
with
it
except
to
hold
the
macon
title,
i
was
going
to
add
and
accept
the
purely
ministerial
function
of
selecting
and
naming
the
original
board
of
managers
and
thereafter
filling
vacancies
on
recommendation
of
the
board
of
managers
or
remaining
members
of
the
board
of
managers
itself.
that
is
a
function
which
obviously
the
executor
could
have
performed
himself
in
the
first
instance
by
himself
selecting
the
members
he
wanted
to
serve
on
this
board
of
managers
or
he
might
have
delegated
that
to
the
executor
or
to
the
private
trustees
who
had
the
property
for
sometime
before
it
passed
interest
to
the
city.
but
it
actually
was
a
function
delegated
to
the
city
of
macon
or
their
successors,
or
their
successors
and
trust
i
believe
the
exact
language
is.
so
that
it
was
--
it
was
a
--
a
ministerial
function
vested
by
the
senator
in
his
will
in
the
city
of
macon
or
the
trustee
who
might
succeed
the
city
of
macon.
that
--
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
the
extent
to
which
the
city
of
macon
has
administered
this
trust.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
that
is
of
course
a
possible
construction.
i
do
not
place
the
same
construction
on
it
myself
and
for
this
reason.
the
title
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
the
mayor
and
council
of
the
city
of
macon
in
formal
meeting
assembled
have
placed,
named
the
original
members
of
the
board
and
have
in
some
instances
named
successors.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
well
i
would
--
i
would
find
that
they
made
the
distinction
between
the
mayor
and
members
of
city
council.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
didn't
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
oh,
yes,
yes,
of
course.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
governing
body
of
the
city
of
macon
and
it
has
been
so
named.
i
assume
that
you're
suggesting
a
possible
distinction
between
applying
the
term
successors
to
the
city
as
trustee
and
to
the
members
of
the
city
council
including
the
mayor
who
(voice
overlap)
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
that's
right.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
no
sir.
i
--
i
wanted
to
make
it
entirely
clear
that
the
time
the
mayor
and
council
of
the
city
of
macon
was
the
charter
name
given
to
the
city
of
macon
and
that
was
the
name
so
used
in
1911
when
this
will
was
drawn.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
obviously
yes.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
they
are
--
the
fund
is
the
revenue
which
is
produced
by
the
board
of
managers
from
the
use
of
property
which
was
left
for
that
specific
purpose.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
it's
actually
a
part
of
the
tract
of
land
which
is
known
as
baconsfield,
but
it
was
separated
by
a
street
from
the
larger
part
and
provision
was
made
for
using
the
land
on
the
south
side
of
the
street
for
commercial
development
and
for
renting
and
leasing
purposes
to
provide
income.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
none
whatsoever
so
far
as
i
know.
policemen
--
policemen
have
been
through
there
certain
sanitary
services
which
are
available
to
public
at
large
have
been
lending,
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
no
sir,
they
are
none
on
the
grounds
anywhere.
i
did
not
â€“
it
was
a
rather
careless
use.
i
was
merely
thinking
of
street
sanitation
and
clean
up
of
sanitation
in
that
sense.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
i'm
not
--
i'm
quite
certain
that
the
city
did.
they
are
public
streets
and
certainly,
we
do
not
question
the
fact
that
the
streets
which
are
in
the
area
are
public
streets
and
are
open
entirely
to
the
public
and
always
have
been,
no
questions
have
been
raised
about
it.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
yes
of
course,
that's
right.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
i'm
afraid
i
can't
answer
that
question.
there
is
of
course
a
zoning
and
planning
commission
which
has
plans
for
the
zoning
of
the
city
and
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
they
have
--
they
do
have
parks
for
the
benefit
of
the
subject
and
i
would
not
be
able
to
answer
to
what
extent
they
may
have
been
influenced
by
the
fact
that
this
park
was
available.
i
just
have
no
information.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
i
think
it
could
be
if
the
--
if
the
case
was
presented
in
that
posture.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
yes.
there's
a
park
in
the
city
of
macon
such
things,
they're
larger
than
a
100
acres
which
is
called
the
central
city
park
and
which
is
a
public
park
owned
by
the
city,
operated
by
the
city,
managed
by
the
city
which
is
open
to
the
public
at
large.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
before
i
was
born
your
honor.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
yes,
all
people
in
the
public
park.
there's
never
been
any
question
about
that
at
all.
there
has
never
been
an
ordinance
on
the
books
of
the
city
of
macon
prescribing
segregation
or
any
form
of
discrimination
on
racial
grounds
or
other
grounds
insofar
as
parks
are
concerned.
there's
never
been
a
statute
in
the
state
of
georgia
which
prescribed
that
insofar
as
parks
are
concerned.
there
has
been
some
other
areas
where
there
has
been
some
discriminatory
statute
or
ordinance.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
as
a
fact,
there
are,
i
believe
three
tennis
courts.
some
three
or
four
softball-baseball
diamonds
and
i
think
that's
all,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
there's
only
one
structure
on
the
park
and
that
was
the
house
which
was
there
when
senator
bacon
was
living
and
which
has
been
maintained
and
preserved.
and
it
is
surrounded
by
some
10
or
15
acres
of
lawn
or
grass
and
it's
used
by
some
groups
for
meeting
places.
that's
--
that's
the
only
structure
on
the
property
at
all
other
than
the
cons
--
the
buildings
which
are
commercially
dealt
with
on
the
other
side
of
the
street.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
no,
sir
there's
been
no
person
in
charge
there
to
control
that
at
all.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
none
whatever,
no
sir.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
the
board
of
managers
--
the
board
of
managers
which
was
named
as
a
successor
board
of
managers
after
the
city
resigned
and
its
resignation
was
accepted
then
the
old
board
of
managers
also
resigned.
and
the
new
trustees
appointed
a
new
board
of
managers
and
they
are
now
technically
at
least,
the
managing
body
of
the
park.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
the
trustees,
the
successor
trustees
were
appointed
by
the
court
in
this
proceeding,
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
no,
it's
the
superior
court
of
bibb
county
which
is
the
court
of
general
trial
jurisdiction
and
which
it
has
jurisdiction
over,
equitable
jurisdiction
over
trust.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
certainly.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
quite
possible
that's
what
it
means.
actually,
i
--
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
a
very
happy
situation
but
i
was
--
last
summer
in
west
palm
beach,
florida
and
i
rode
down
the
public
street.
there's
a
home
over
there
boarded
up
and
walled
up
that
i
think
was
occupied
by
the
late
president
kennedy's
father
and
i
couldn't
get
in
there.
if
i
could
--
i
could
--
i
could
get
on
the
street
by
the
side
of
it,
but
it
was
completely
barricaded
and
restricted
so
far
as
my
coming
in
is
concerned.
and
of
course
that
not
suggesting
a
racial
discrimination
at
all,
but
i
--
i
don't
see
that
the
fact
that
there
is
a
street
which
divides
portions
of
the
park
which
is
completely
open
to
the
public
and
which
is
not
controlled
--
which
are
not
controlled
in
any
way,
shape
or
manner
affects
the
question
of
the
constitutional
question
which
we
are
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
there
were
--
there
were
$10,000
of
bonds
that
were
left
to
the
city
as
trustee.
the
income
to
be
turned
over
to
the
board
of
managers
and
to
be
used
by
the
board
of
managers
in
the
operation
of
the
park.
actually,
the
entire
principle
in
income
with
the
board
--
of
the
bonds
were
long
since
turned
over
to
the
board
of
managers
and
have
been
kind
of
disappeared
and
no
longer
exist.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
for
the
park,
that's
right.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
the
record
shows
nothing
or
whatever.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
the
--
the
present
expense
of
maintaining,
it
is
quite
limited
because
since
this
situation
arose,
nothing
has
been
done
there.
the
thing
is
really
in
that
quite
status
quo
and
nothing
is
being
spent
except
for
laundering
the
grass
and
keeping
it
clean.
and
that
is
done
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
that's
right
but
i
believe
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
--
i
believe
--
that's
cost
around
$1400
a
month
or
what
is
the
amount
thus
far.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
the
basic
cost
for
just
manicuring
in
the
lawns
and
cost
is
a
very
substantial
item
but
that
is
completely
covered
by
the
income
which
is
available
for
that
purpose.
now
you
asked
me
if
the
record
showed
that
facts
and
practically
everything
we've
been
talking
about
here
is
not
in
the
record.
and
that
--
that
--
that
brings
me,
if
your
honor
please,
to
a
point
that
i
did
want
to
emphasize.
if
--
if
the
--
well
to
begin
with
and
going
back
one
step,
in
the
state
courts
where
these
case
originated
where
it
was
before
it
came
here,
there
was
never
at
any
time
emphasis
placed
upon
the
fact
that
this
was
in
the
nature
of
a
public
facility.
the
emphasis
was
placed
upon
this
city
and
the
legislative
influence
upon
that
and
to
the
extent
that
it's
all
participation,
but
the
significance
of
that
is
that
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
put
there
by
either
side
presenting
the
character,
the
physical
character
of
this
park.
the
actual
use
that
was
made
of
it
such
as
it
seems
to
me
would
be
essential
when
this
court
is
now
asked
to
say
that
it's
a
park
of
such
magnitude
and
such
importance
and
vital
significance
in
the
life
of
the
whole
community
of
macon
that
it
stems
itself
completely
as
something
completely
different
from
the
ordinary
public
charity
which
is
more
private
in
which
it's
restricted
to
less
people.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
it
looks
to
me
like
there
would
have
to
be
a
record
here
on
which
this
court
would
be
able
to
throw
a
judgment
that
this
is
a
park
of
a
character
to
come
within
that
sweeping
problem.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
i
imagine
that
it
was
simply
by
the
roadway
being
opened
up
and
public
use
being
allowed
to
it
and
thus
becoming
a
street.
i'm
quite
sure
there
was
never
any
formal
passage
of
title
to
the
street.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
well
yes,
exactly.
i
mean
that
when
one
or
two
lanes
or
streets
were
opened
up
through
the
park
and
made
available
to
the
public,
they
became
so
far
as
the
public
was
concerned,
public
streets
and
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
city
for
supervision
and
maintenance.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
you're
asking
me
a
question,
your
honor.
your
honor
actually,
i
have
no
knowledge
of
the
details
and
manner
in
which
those
things
happened.
they
were
many,
many
years
ago.
50
years
is
really
not
so
long
as
some
younger
people
might
think
it
to
be,
but
still
it
is
a
long
time
ago
so
far
as
the
--
as
pointing
out
the
actual
manner
in
which
some
of
these
things
occurred.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
might
well
have
been.
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
be
too
certain
of
this.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
i
wouldn't
think
so,
if
your
honor
please,
if
it
was
merely
for
the
use
of
those
who
were
using
the
park,
they
could
have
been
made
private
lands
and
could
--
would
not
have
been
within
the
city's
jurisdiction
at
all.
actually,
the
--
one
street
which
is
a
significant
--
well
to
begin
with,
when
the
will
was
drawn,
the
park
laid
partly
on
the
side
of
one
major
--
one
street
which
is
now
a
major,
east
west
boulevard
in
the
city
so
that
the
park
itself
was
already
separated
by
a
public
street
and
that
was
always
a
public
street.
but
then
another
street
is
â€“
goes
through
the
park
--
a
park
which
is
used
by
people
coming
in,
in
any
direction
and
going
to
another
direction
just
purely
to
travel.
and
that
street,
when
it
was
open
and
its
use
was
allowed
for
that
purpose,
did
become
a
public
street.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
yes,
may
i
--
may
i
anticipate
your
question
or
may
i
answer
that
specific
question?
under
the
will,
the
property
is
described
by
courses
by
boundary
courses
and
distances.
it
has
been
estimated
by
the
government
in
its
brief
that
that
contains
approximately
100
acres
and
that
is
a
substantial
to
fair
accurate,
i
would
say
100
acres.
however,
may
i
add
this?
they
made
reference
in
their
brief
to
an
interstate
highway
that
runs
through
it
and
they
attach
a
map
of
the
city
of
macon
which
does
give
us
a
picturization
of
the
park
in
some
measure.
this
interstate
highway
was
taken
by
the
highway
department
as
part
of
the
nice
little
expressway
system.
it's
a
non-access
highway.
it
contains,
according
to
computations
which
can
easily
be
made.
itself
over
25
acres,
it
sentence
--
separates
and
assess
all
between
it
and
the
banks
of
the
river
which
is
referred
to
another
25
acres
which
is
bottom
land,
which
has
never
been
used
for
park
purpose
which
now
actually,
is
not
available
for
park
purposes.
there
is
also
another
10
or
15
acres
on
the
south
side
of
spring
street
which
is
the
commercial
part
of
it,
leaving
actually
40
acres
which
is
park
land.
now
i'm
sort
of
whittling
this
100
acres
down
to
40.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
it
was
condemned
in
the
court
proceeding.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
the
state
consented
against
the
board
of
managers.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
paid
the
board
of
managers.
i
beg
your
pardon.
yes,
they
paid
the
board
of
--
no.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
the
--
the
city
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
the
city
at
that
time
had
resigned
as
trustee
and
they
paid
the
successor
trustee
as
i
believe
that's
accurate
in
[inaudible]
but
never
mind.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
the
state
highway
department
acquired
25
acres
of
this
100-acre
tract
for
an
interstate
non-access
highway
and
they
condemned
the
property
and
the
money
is
now
being
held,
i
can
answer
the
question
to
this
extent,
i
know
exactly
where
the
money
is
now,
is
now
being
held
by
the
successor
private
trustees
who
appointed
under
instructions
from
the
court
to
hold
it
until
they
was
certain
they
have
a
right
to
it
pending
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
yes
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
it's
--
it's
a
broken
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
it
does
not
have
a
playground
as
such.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
it
has
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
--
three
tennis
courts,
two
or
three
softball,
baseball
diamonds
at
the
east
side
of
it.
it
has
a
house
surrounded
by
some
10
or
15
acres
of
lawn
which
is
well
maintained
and
well
kept
and
attractive
on
the
east
side
of
the
tennis
courts
and
then
half
of
the
40
acres,
to
the
north
is
wooded
land
with
some
flowers,
and
plants,
and
shrubs.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
well
certainly
if
the
city
owned
it
and
was
operating
as
a
park
so
that
would
be
conceded
if
that's
the
--
if
i
understood
your
question.
the
city
doesn't
own
it
now
at
all,
they
did
on
it
is
as
trustee.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
exactly,
that's
right.
and
--
and
if
--
if
the
city
at
anytime
owned
it,
they
couldn't
buy
subterfuge
accomplished
segregation
by
divesting
themselves
for
that
purpose
or
under
other
limitations
of
the
property
which
they
are
not
(voice
overlap)
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
no,
i
certainly
do
not,
your
honor.
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
i
could
possibly
make
that
concession
of
--
if
--
if
it
were
--
if
the
city
had
nothing
to
do
with
it,
the
fact
that's
in
a
city
doesn't
make
it
a
city
operated
park.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
which
they
don't
do.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
my
issue
is
â€“
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
yes,
of
course
my
issue
is
the
one
that
they
made
for
me
and
i
have
to,
myself,
know
what
it
is
before
i
know
exactly
what
the
issue
is,
but
i
take
the
issue
to
be
as
lately
expressed
by
mr.
claiborne
in
his
remark
whether
or
not,
this
park
has
such
public,
governmental
characteristics
as
comparable
to
that
involved
in
the
marsh
case
or
on
some
extent
you
know
the
doctrine
of
the
marsh
case
as
to
make
it
beyond
the
appeal
of
private
ownership
and
complete
private
control
within
the
limitations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
that's
what
i
understand
to
be
the
issue
posed
by
mr.
claiborne.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
that's
right.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
exactly.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
quite
so,
yes.
may
or
naked
ownership
by
the
private
corporation
which
owned
it
because
they
had
made
out
of
it
a
community,
a
town.
and
since
it
was
a
town,
it
was
part
of
the
public
life
or
public
governmental
life,
public
political
life,
with
shops
open
to
the
public
and
used
by
the
public
all
the
way
through
it
with
the
post
office
there
that
served
not
only
the
people
in
there,
but
elsewhere
where
they
received
mail
for
the
delivery.
it
had
--
it
had
by
practice
and
usage
there
and
by
characterization
by
this
court
become
insofar
a
town
as
to
be
a
town
in
exactly
the
same
sense
that
any
other
town
chartered
by
the
state
board.
now
that
--
that's
the
impression
which
i
have
of
the
marsh
case,
but
i
said
--
i
say
that
they
cannot
place
this
case
in
that
category
merely
by
calling
it
a
park.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
but
they
haven't
--
that
isn't
in
the
record.
they
haven't
brought
that
here.
they
didn't
insist
on
that
in
the
trial
court.
and
--
and
this
court
now
would
--
i've
got
no
objection
of
course
to
the
court
having
all
the
information
that's
in
my
power
to
give
along
and
anybody
else's
power
for
that
matter
but
i
don't
think
that
this
case
is
in
its
present
posture
before
this
court
presents
that
question
because
they're
simply
--
it
was
never
made
in
the
lower
court.
it
--
it
isn't
in
such
shape
that
this
court
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
the
characterization
of
this
park
as
such
--
as
being
such
a
public
activity
irrespective
of
ownership
as
to
bring
it
within
the
scope
of
the
marsh
decision
as
we've
been
discussing.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
well
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
if
that
issue
had
been
tended
to
the
lower
court,
i
would
have
shown
the
limited
facilities
there,
the
limited
size
which
is
available
for
any
enjoyment
by
any
part
of
the
public.
i
would
have
shown
the
pictures
i
suppose,
the
absence
of
any
buildings
of
any
sold
out
character
which
were
used
by
the
persons
who
enjoyed
the
park.
and
generally,
i
would
have
let
this
court
know
that
it
wasn't
of
the
magnitude,
and
size,
and
characteristic
which
i
think
they
have
the
burden
of
showing
if
they
want
this
court
to
act
on
that.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
there's
a
small
marker,
i
would
say
about
the
size
of
this
dice
which
names
that
park
baconsfield
and
i
believe
some
things
that
the
bacon
mean,
is
that
right?
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
that's
right
in
memorial
of
the
senator,
the
plaque
of
state
that
is
a
memorial
to
senator
bacon's
family
or
whoever
the
person
memorialize
was.
there's
--
there's
nothing
on
the
property
in
a
way
of
a
sign.
there's
nothing
on
the
property
in
the
way
of
gates
or
closed
structures
except
that
there
is
a
very
small
bronze
marker
which
shows
that
it
was
given
by
senator
bacon
as
a
memorial
to
some
members
of
his
family.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
the
house
is
used
by
some
women's
groups
who
go
over
there
and
meet
and
have
tea
or
meals
for
the
social
purpose.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
not
limited
at
all.
you
asked
what
it
was
used
for.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
i
don't
know
if
there's
such
a
limitation.
that
is
the
actual
use
which
is
made
of
it.
i
do
not
know
of
any
rules
that
they
have
that
would
deny
use
for
any
other
purpose
so
that
i
just
happen
to
know
that
that
is
the
practical
use
which
is
made
of
it.
i
don't
think
there
had
been
any
rules
limiting
its
use
for
other
purposes.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
no
sir.
that's
entirely
out
of
the
record.
nothing
of
that
sort
is
in
the
record.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
it.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
--
i
have
seen
it.
i
know
it's
a
small
marker.
i
never
paid
attention
to
it
much
mr.
sparks
was
helping
me
a
little
bit
because
he
lives
in
that
area,
the
one
reason
he
has
lived
there
and
he
has
seen
it
himself
and
it's
in
the
nature
of
a
simple
marker
indicating
a
memorial
to
some
members
(voice
overlap)
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
do
you
know,
mr.
sparks
what
it
says?
if
he
doesn't,
i'm
sure
i
don't.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
did
your
honor
hear
that?
he
says
that
it
contains
some
quotations
from
the
will
of
some
senator
bacon
and
state
that
it
was
left
by
him
as
a
memorial
to
two
members
of
his
family.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
did
he
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
to
the
city
as
trustee.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
i
hope
that
answers.
that's
the
answer
i
have
from
mr.
spark.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
yes,
sir,
it
is
tax
exempt
except
the
course
not
the
commercially
used
part
of
it
which
is
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
public
charity.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
as
all
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
no,
sir,
not
at
all,
it
is
exempt
as
a
public
charity.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
i
say
that
they
serve
tea
as
i
think
they
also
serve
lunch
to
--
for
luncheon
meetings
there.
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
no
sir,
it's
a
[inaudible]
which
are
served
--
it
does
not
serve
lunch.
it
does
--
it
does
not
serve
meals
in
the
sense
of
being
open
at
any
hour.
they
serve
merely
prepare
luncheon
for
certain
groups.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
it
would
not
be
a
public
accommodation
if
i
understand
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
yes,
i've
gathered
so
it
--
it
has
arrangement
there
whereby
a
group
would
have
lunch
prepared
for
that
group
at
--
on
reservation
or
specifications
when
groups
were
meeting
there.
i
think
the
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
yes
sir,
the
city
of
macon
has
a
park
--
mayor
and
city
council
of
macon
has
a
park
committee
which
actually
administers.
they
have
a
superintendent
of
parks
in
an
organization.
they
have
playground
directors
and
park
supervisors
and
functionaries
of
that
sort
and
that
is
actually
not
handled
by
park
commission
but
by
the
mayor
and
council
through
a
committee.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
yes.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
i
could
not
answer
that
question,
your
honor.
it's
certainly
not
by
any
formal
action.
i
--
i
don't
know
if
it
had
been
at
all
although
they
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
it's
always
been
recognized
as
being
managed
by
and
under
the
complete
control
and
supervision
of
the
board
of
managers.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
no,
sir,
none
or
whatever.
purely
under
--
purely
and
solely
and
exclusively
for
this
particular
park
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
that's
right.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
that's
right.
the
trustee
holds
a
legal
title
to
the
commercial
property.
the
board
of
managers
manages
it
and
controls
and
uses
the
income
from
it.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
no,
i
hadn't
gone
that
far
because
i
think
that
as
long
as
the
city
of
macon
holds
a
legal
title,
i
think
we
are
completely
restricted
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
girard
college
case,
the
first
girard
college
case
where
among
other
things,
it
seem
to
me
that
the
--
to
rest
upon
the
narrow
fact,
although
other
facts
existed,
the
narrow
fact
that
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
that
--
that
--
there
was
a
public
trustee,
that's
right.
so
now
we
are
dealing
with
the
question
which
came
up
in
the
second
girard
as
to
what
happens
when
the
public
trustee
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
that's
right,
exactly.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
no
sir
it
has
not
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
i
would
be
shocked
to
find
that
something
had
been
done
that
were
preclude
it.
they
--
the
--
the
heirs
came
in
at
a
stage
while
this
case
was
pending
and
actually
came
in
in
support
of
the
charity
that
is
it
came
in
to
lend
weight
of
their
support
to
the
charity
and
to
the
preservation
of
the
park
as
a
charity
within
the
terms
of
the
senator's
will,
but
they
say
it
alternatively
that
if
it
could
not
be
operated
for
the
purposes
and
for
the
benefits
expressed
in
senator
bacon's
will
then
they
would
--
they
wanted
to
exercise
their
power
of
reversion.
well
when
the
court
accepted
the
resignation
of
the
city
as
trustee
and
appointed
successor
trustees,
that
at
least
for
the
time
being
satisfied
any
question
which
the
--
which
the
heirs
had
raised
in
there
and
left
nothing,
the
court
says
specifically
that
since
they've
got
what
they
asked
for
insofar
as
this
court
is
concerned,
that
question
is
not
that
for
decision,
so
no
decision
has
been
made
about
it
at
all
and
that
was
the
posture
in
which
it
left
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
there
also
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
yes
sir.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
said
it
would
not.
in
this
particular
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
it
--
the
--
the
--
we
have
never
relayed
on
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
thought
you
mean
what
did
this
decision
mean?
the
georgia
supreme
court
said
that
supra
was
not
involved.
the
georgia
supreme
court
said
the
supra
was
not
involved
at
all
for
several
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
it
was
not
claimed
in
the
court
below
by
anybody.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
it
would
not
passed
on
(voice
overlap)
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
no
sir.
they
have
not
--
they
have
not
applied
[inaudible]
in
the
sense.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
no
sir
they've
said
they
wouldn't.
they
said
they
had
no
occasion
to
in
that
case.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
if
they
have
said
that
it
might,
they
--
they
did
not.
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
they
--
plaintiffs
--
the
interevenors
in
the
lower
court
and
the
petitioners
in
this
court
asserted
that
the
trial
court
should
have
applied
the
supra
section
of
the
georgia
court
that
when
a
charitable
request
is
incapable
of
some
reason
of
this
--
is
incapable
for
some
reason
of
the
exact
execution
and
the
exact
manner
provided
by
the
testator,
a
court
of
equity
will
carry
it
into
effect
in
such
way
as
nearly
as
possible
to
effect
his
intention.
the
first
answer
was
that
the
application
was
not
invoked
in
the
second
case
and
then
they
said
there
was
no
testimony
in
the
record
of
any
nature
or
character
that
the
board
of
managers
provided
by
the
will
--
the
board
of
managers
provided
by
the
will
into
then
situation
could
not
operate
the
park
pursuant
to
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
will
that
was
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
no.
the
contention
was
made
that
they
couldn't
resign
because
the
will
made
it
mandatory
that
they
remain
trustees
perpetually
and
forever,
notwithstanding
the
references
to
their
successes
and
trust.
the
court
said
that
--
it
wasn't
necessary
to
decide
that
question.
the
simple
fact
was
they
had
resigned
and
that
having
resigned,
it
was
the
duty
and
function
of
the
trial
court
to
appoint
successors
to
the
trustees.
that's
all
they
said
about
that.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
no
sir,
i
don't
know
of
any.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
in
order
for
any
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
in
order
for
a
tax
exemption
to
be
afforded
to
any
group,
that
group
must
qualify
as
a
charity
and
that
would
mean
within
the
functions
of
--
the
scope
of
the
charitable
objective
as
recognized
in
georgia,
i
would
say
that
--
i
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
myself
to
suggest
that
a
place
maintained
merely
for
the
purpose
of
committing
certain
limited
groups
to
come
here
and
to
have
meetings
would
qualify
to
have
the
charity
within
that
sense.
i
don't
know
of
any
instance
where
such
thing
is
attempted.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
it
probably
has
got
five
or
six
or
seven
rooms
in
it,
moderate
size
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
as
part
of
the
whole
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
the
burden
of
the
public
of
course
all
--
all
of
the
public
of
course
always
pay
as
part
of
the
burden
or
pays
the
burden
of
any
tax
exemption.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
with
private
trustees?
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
with
private
trustees?
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
yes.
i
think
they
could
your
honor
under
the
georgia
law.
i
think
the
question
of
tax
exemption
under
the
georgia
law
is
granted
or
withheld
under
the
georgia
laws
and
i
think
as
it
now
constitute
if
we
could
qualify
that
as
a
charity,
we
would
be
entitled
with
the
exemption,
yes.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
you
mean
for
the
purpose
only
of
a
meeting
place
for
groups
of
women?
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
i
doubt
it.
no
i
wouldn't
think
so,
but
bear
in
mind
that
this
is
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
it's
quite
difficult
for
me
to
see
that.
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
i
--
i
see
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
this
particular
case,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
i
see
a
difference
in
the
operation
by
private
or
public
trustees
insofar
as
solely
the
question
of
tax
exemption
is
involved
in
an
instrument
which
had
no
other
function
than
to
leave
a
house
with
some
grounds
around
it
to
be
used
by
certain
limited
groups
of
people.
i
--
i
just
would
never
myself
be
able
to
contend
that
that
was
a
charity
--
mr.
c.
baxter
jones
--
all
by
itself,
but
i
don't
think
it
prevents
the
park
from
being
the
charity
under
its
administration
even
by
the
city
or
private
trustees
and
the
fact
that
the
board
of
managers
that
that
the
use
which
is
made
of
a
particular
structure
on
that
house
is
largely
as
a
practical
manner
confined
to
that
practical
use.
i
just
don't
--
i
just
--
i
just
--
i
don't
--
don't
see
the
follow
up
of
that
situation
to
the
question
which
your
honor
wish
to
point.
your
honors
will
recognize
i'm
sure
that
i'm
in
the
same
position
that
mr.
claiborne
was
that
--
i
still
have
my
notes
here
and
haven't
covered
much
of
this
case.
however
everything
that
i
would
say
here
is
also
in
the
brief
and
i
think
i
don't
know
exactly
the
situation
of
the
time.
i
should
now
turn
this
over
to
my
associate
for
--
and
i
might
explain
that
several
times
mr.
justice
brennan
particularly
has
referred
to
girard.
we
think
that
girard
has
a
very
definite
impact
upon
this
case
and
i'm
sure
that
one
is
not
the
main
matter
which
mr.
jones
will
follow
would
be
the
girard
case
--
may
provide
your
honors
with
some
of
the
answers
that
you've
been
suggesting.
thank
you.
