mr.
frank
c.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
several
questions
that
have
been
asked
about
the
girard
litigation
and
also
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
referred
to
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
has
been
felt
throughout
this
litigation
to
be
of
significance,
i
would
like
to
comment
briefly
about
the
further
proceedings
in
particular
that
took
place
following
the
1957
decision
by
this
court
in
the
first
girard
case.
your
honors
recall
of
course
that
mr.
girard
died
in
1831
living
the
sum
of
$2
million
in
trust
for
a
college
for
four
male
white
orphans
that
the
college
was
subsequently
established
in
1948
that
the
city
of
philadelphia
first
served
as
trustee
but
subsequently,
the
pennsylvania
legislature
created
a
board
of
city
trust
which
in
1869
succeeded
to
that
function
and
served
thereafter
continuously
until
the
time
of
this
litigation.
also
that
that
board
included
the
mayor
of
philadelphia,
the
president
of
city
council
and
various
private
citizens.
after
this
court
held
in
1957,
that
the
application
of
two
negro
orphans
who
were
otherwise
fully
qualified
could
not
be
denied
solely
because
of
race
with
the
board
as
a
city
agency
serving
as
trustee.
it
was
then
amended
by
this
court
for
further
proceedings
below
not
inconsistent
with
that
opinion.
i
would
like
to
deviate
at
that
point
and
make
the
observation
that
prior
to
the
case
reaching
this
court
in
1957
the
part
had
been
made
very
strongly
both
in
the
orphans'
court
of
philadelphia
where
the
litigation
originated
and
later
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
that
in
the
event
that
it
was
ruled
that
the
board
of
city
trust
could
not
continue
constitutionally
to
carry
out
the
intention
manifested
in
girard
will
that
then
would
become
necessary
that
substituted
trustees
be
appointed
for
that
purpose,
so
that
that
contention
was
a
--
a
question
which
existed
in
the
litigation
almost
from
the
very
outset.
following
the
remand
by
this
court,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
then
remanded
the
case
to
the
orphans'
court
also
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
that
opinion.
the
court
will
recall
that
the
orphans'
court
after
delay
of
some
two
months,
removed
the
board
of
city
trust
as
trustee
and
appointed
as
substituted
to
trustees
13
private
persons,
six
of
them
incidentally
had
up
until
that
time
served
on
the
board
of
city
trust.
it
dismissed
the
application
of
the
two
negro
orphans.
both
the
city
and
the
state
pennsylvania
and
the
applicants
then
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
pennsylvania.
our
view
of
the
briefs
that
were
filed
in
that
litigation
has
impressed
us
very
much
that
virtually,
every
contention
which
is
made
in
the
present
litigation
was
made
in
a
most
forceful
amount
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
now
that
court
ruled
that
steven
girard
had
a
constitutional
right
of
property
in
the
execution
of
his
testamentary
benefaction
that
the
trust
was
a
private
one,
that
the
orphans'
court
had
the
inherent
power
to
remove
the
trustee
and
that
there
was
not
discrimination.
we
attach
considerable
significance
subsequently
ruling
by
this
court
in
denying
the
appeal
and
in
dismissing
the
appeal
and
denying
the
application
for
certiorari
for
several
reasons,
among
the
them
being
that
the
matter
of
substituted
trustees
have
been
an
extremely
important
consideration
from
the
very
outset
of
litigation
and
particularly
of
course
in
the
orphans'
court
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
it's
seems
to
us
your
honor
that
the
conclusion
by
this
court
that
there
was
not
such
a
case
that
would
justify
further
review
on
certiorari
was
widely
interpreted
at
the
time
and
certainly
it
seems
to
us
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
this
case
as
being
most
significant
decision.
again,
i
would
point
out
to
this
court
that
almost
to
every
contention
that
was
made
in
the
present
case
at
any
stage
of
litigation
was
made
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
and
in
the
record
that
came
to
this
case
in
second
girard.
it
was
contended
for
example
that
girard's
primary
object
was
trusteeship
by
the
city
rather
than
the
establishment
of
a
college
for
four
male
white
orphans.
that
contention
was
rejected
in
the
very
extensive
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
we
would
point
out
that
in
the
present
case
this
deals
with
one
point
that
was
raised
earlier.
that
there
is
the
use
of
language
in
item
nine
of
senator
bacon's
will,
following
the
naming
of
the
mayor
and
council
or
their
successors
and
trust.
there
is
a
provision
to
the
effect
that
in
the
event
that
the
city
could
not
serve
as
trustee
that
the
city
would
be
authorize
to
a
point
a
trustee,
presumably
a
private
person
to
function
in
that
capacity.
the
fact
that
a
designation
of
the
body
to
appoint,
the
initial
board
of
managers
and
the
approval
of
subsequent
nominees
for
that
office
was
designated
as
the
mayor
and
council
and
then
the
language
or
their
successors
powers,
certainly
illustrates
to
us
that
the
word
successors
were
not
necessary
as
referring
to
the
mayor
and
council
because
that
was
the
correct
corporate
name
of
the
city
of
macon
at
that
time
and
certainly
manifested
the
intention
or
contemplation
on
the
part
of
the
testator
that
a
trustee
other
than
the
city
of
macon
might
serve
in
that
capacity.
the
point
was
also
made
most
forcefully
in
that
litigation
that
after
a
126
years
of
exceedingly
active
state
and
city
participation
in
the
administration
of
the
trust,
the
girard
college
had
become
a
public
institution
so
that
even
if
the
board
of
trust
should
be
replaced
as
trustee,
it
remained
such
a
public
institution
as
would
cause
the
fourteen
amendment
to
continue
to
be
applicable
and
to
forbid
discrimination
in
carrying
out
the
testimator's
scheme.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
that
particular
reference
was
to
item
10
the
--
there
was
also
language
in
item
nine.
the
language
in
item
10,
if
the
court
would
like
me
to
refer
to
it
is
on
page
24
of
the
record
in
this
case.
it
is
to
the
effect
if
any
reason
it
should
held
that
the
mayor
and
the
council
of
the
city
of
macon
have
not
the
legal
power
under
the
charter
of
the
city
to
hold
said
fund
and
trust
for
the
purposes
specified
then
unless
said
the
powers
obtain
through
appropriate
legislation,
direct
to
the
powers
herein
expressed
to
be
conferred
upon
a
trustee
to
be
selected
by
the
mayor
and
council
of
the
city
of
macon
was
such
safeguard
and
reflection
to
it
etcetera.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
your
honor.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
this
is
at
the
top
of
page
24
your
honor,
beginning
in
the
first
line
here
for
any
reason.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
there
is
further
reference
about
to
10th
to
12th
line
and
i
give
a
similar
direction
if
any
reason
it
should
be
held
that
the
mayor
and
council
of
the
city
of
macon
have
not
the
legal
power
under
the
charter
to
hold
in
trust
for
the
purposes
specified
etcetera.t
hat
is
not
the
exact
procedure
of
course,
it
was
followed
in
this
instance
but
i
cite
it
because
it
certainly
evidence
to
contemplation
on
the
part
of
the
testator
that
the
city
it
might
not
always
serve
as
trustee
and
that
it
might
become
necessary
that
a
successor
trustee
be
appointed.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
both
your
honor,
there
are
separates
sentences.
one
refers
to
holding
the
park
and
the
other
refers
to
holding
the
front.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
your
honor
and
the
other
language
that
i
refer
to
or
their
successors
appears
in
the
item
nine
on
page
19
of
the
record
where
the
statement
is
made.
the
members
of
this
board
shall
first
be
selected
and
appointed
by
the
mayor
and
council
of
the
city
of
macon
or
by
their
successors
in
trust.
my
point
is
that
since
the
mayor
and
council
of
the
city
of
macon
was
the
correct
corporate
name
of
the
city
of
macon,
there
was
no
necessity
for
that
following
language
to
be
used
to
refer
to
their
particular
successors
as
persons.
and
that
the
language
evidences
the
contemplation
on
the
part
the
testator
that
someone
other
than
the
mayor
and
council
at
any
particular
time
might
succeed
as
trustee.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
i
would
make
the
observation;
first
of
all,
that
that's
customarily
language
are
used
in
georgia
trust
instruments
and
secondly,
the
language
and
to
their
successors
forever
is
capable
of
either
of
two
constructions.
first
of
all,
the
particular
persons
who
might
succeed
as
the
mayor
and
the
members
of
council
or
to
whoever
might
say
other
than
the
mayor
and
council
as
trustee.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
then
the
further
reference
in
that
same
item
to
--
or
to
their
successors
and
the
particular
reference
in
item
10
to
the
selection
by
the
city
itself
of
a
successor
trustee
makes
clear
that
senator
bacon
definitely
contemplated
the
possibility
that
someone
other
than
the
mayor
and
council
might
serve
in
that
capacity.
your
honor,
i
was
making
that
point
that
in
the
girard
litigation,
the
second
girard
case
both
in
the
courts
of
pennsylvania
and
in
the
record
in
this
court,
the
point
was
made
most
forcefully
that
because
of
126
years
of
active
operation
and
administration
by
the
city
and
state,
the
growth
of
the
$2
million
fund
to
a
$100
million,
the
growth
of
the
college
saw
that
there
was
an
enrollment
of
over
1000
and
all
of
the
many
facets
of
state
and
--
city
and
state
relationship
including
the
existence
of
some
five
different
pennsylvania
statutes
on
the
subject.
the
girard
college
had
become
a
public
institution
and
that
the
mere
replacement
of
the
trustee
could
not
change
its
essentially
public
character.
that
contention
was
rejected
most
forcefully
by
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
the
point
was
made
that
merely
because
they
had
been
put
on
in
a
skillful
management
of
the
trust
by
the
board
of
trust
will
not
change
its
essential
character
that
it
was
created
as
a
private
charity
although
it
had
certain
public
characteristics
of
course
and
that
it
remained
so
and
despite
the
fact
of
that
statutory
or
framework
which
had
come
in
to
existence
in
the
other
matters
which
it
mentioned.
again,
i
would
deviate
at
this
point
to
make
the
point
which
we
feel
is
most
important
that
the
degree
of
city
and
state
connection
with
baconsfield
park
has
been
exceedingly
limited,
far
less
significant
and
existed
in
girard
case,
really
being
confined
as
we
see
it
to
first
of
all,
the
meaning
of
the
city
as
the
naked
legal
trustee
and
secondly
to
giving
the
right
to
the
city
initially
to
name
the
board
of
managers
and
subsequently
to
approve
nominations
to
the
board
with
no
further
rights
and
when
the
city
of
macon
resigned
as
trustee,
as
we
see
it,
there
was
a
complete
severance
of
any
further
city
or
state
connection
in
the
relationship
with
baconsfield
park.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor
that
is
not
my
understanding.
i
cannot
speak
authoritatively
other
than
what
has
come
to
me
second
hand,
but
it
is
my
understanding
that
at
the
present
time,
it's
still
being
operated
as
it
was
in
1957
and
that
the
same
policy
which
existed
in
1957
and
which
caused
that
litigation
to
come
to
this
court
is
still
the
policy
at
girard
college
and
admission
is
being
limited
to
full
male
white
orphans.
your
honor,
there
are
a
great
many
other
arguments
that
were
made
in
girard
including
the
contended
application
of
shelley
versus
kraemer
in
other
cases
that
in
the
interest
of
time,
i
won't
undertake
to
treat
them
in
the
oral
argument
because
we
have
covered
those
matters
in
our
brief.
i
would
though
in
concluding
my
remarks
like
to
make
the
point
that
we
are
unable
to
distinguish
between
the
girard
situation
and
the
baconsfield
situation.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
i
have
read
the
brief
that
was
filed
in
opposition
to
the
appeal
in
the
certiorari
in
second
girard
and
i'm
aware
that
a
number
of
different
reasons
partly
jurisdictional,
partly
otherwise
were
asserted
as
to
why
the
appeal
should
not
be
entertained
by
this
court
and
should
be
dismissed.
i
of
course
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
what
particular
reason
may
have
impressed
the
court
as
being
the
best
one
or
be
best
ones
and
as
to
why
the
appeal
would
dismissed.
however,
as
far
as
the
denial
of
certiorari
is
concerned,
i
do
attach
great
significance
to
that
and
i
think
national
significance
has
been
attached
to
it.
i
know
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
attached
significance.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor,
quite
frankly,
i
won't
be
able
to
answer
that
question
because
the
only
thing
that
has
come
to
my
attention
is
the
fact
that
a
number
of
different
grounds
for
dismissal
raised
by
the
respondents
in
that
case
including
the
fact
that
there
was
no
pennsylvania
statute,
the
constitutionality
of
which
had
been
brought
an
issue
in
the
lower
court
proceedings.
the
point
i
was
making
was
that
in
as
much
as
the
further
proceedings
--
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
frank
c.
jones
i
hope
i
haven't
misstated
my
position
your
honor.
i
was
not
contending
that
of
course
that
the
ruling
on
certiorari
was
on
the
merits.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
your
honor
i'm
not
making
contention
one
way
or
the
other
in
that
regard.
mr.
frank
c.
jones
the
significance
that
i
was
seeking
to
attach
to
the
action
of
this
court
in
the
second
girard
case
was
that
both
the
orphans'
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
were
under
the
mandate
of
this
court
that
their
further
proceeding
should
not
be
inconsistent
with
the
first
1957
opinion
of
this
court
and
in
as
much
as
both
before
the
first
opinion
of
this
court
in
1957
and
thereafter,
it
had
been
in
a
most
forceful
way
brought
out
that
the
board
of
city
trust
would
if
necessary
be
removed
as
trustee
and
the
private
trustees
would
be
appointed
for
the
express
purpose
of
carrying
out
the
restriction
contained
in
mr.
girard's
will.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
reason
why
the
denial
of
certiorari
carried
unusual
significance
as
far
as
its
interpretation
is
concerned.
your
honor,
i
believe
my
time
is
up
and
i
would
say
simply
in
conclusion
that
we
believe
that
there
is
such
a
total
lack
of
state
involvement
following
the
resignation
of
the
city
which
was
accepted
as
a
matter
of
state
law
as
we
interpret
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
decision
that
there
is
no
reason
why
the
provisions
of
senator
bacon's
will
could
not
be
carried
out
as
a
private
charity.
we
think
that
to
rule
otherwise
would
take
the
props
completely
out
from
under
the
girard
collage
situation
and
would
affect
as
previous
questions
of
this
court
have
suggested
when
posed
to
mr.
claiborne
not
only
a
park
and
a
collage
but
many,
many
other
forms
of
private
charities
as
well.
