justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
claiborne,
i
gather
then
anything
is
--
would
be
public
and
your
definition
if
--
if
it's
open
to
everybody
in
the
community
except
one
defined
class,
say
negroes
even
though
that
the
city
or
the
governmental
authorities
have
no
ownership
to
control,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
posed
the
private
park,
run
by
private
trustees.
i
suppose
that
would
go
for
any
other
facility
wouldn't
it
that
--
that
was
run
by
a
private
organization
like
the
business
organization?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
also
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
about
a
school,
private
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
a
church?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
yes
but
that's
--
that
just
means
that
the
--
all
that
means
is
that
only
a
few
people
in
the
community
may
choose
to
join
the
church
but
it's
open.
it's
open
that
if
anybody
wants
to
join
it
can
join
it
and
come
to
this
church,
and
come
to
the
services
the
fact
the
public
is
invited
all
the
time
except
one
class.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
essential
in
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
performing
a
governmental
function?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
--
that
is
essential
in
your
analysis?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
operates
the
park
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
trustees
were
appointed
by
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
jones
you
said
there
were
public
streets
that
go
through
the
park
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
paid
by
the
city,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
city's
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
it
in
the
record
mr.
jones?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
part
of
the
record
you
suppose
would
be
made
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
of
record
that
you
have
made
as
you
put
it
to
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
jones
lets
assume
that
it
were
held
that
this
park
could
not
be
operated
on
a
restricted
basis
on
discriminatory
basis.
has
the
issue
of
reversion
to
the
heirs
are
not
been
resolved
in
the
lower
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
anything
been
done
that
would
preclude
the
either
side
from
taking
any
position
they
wanted
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
whether
--
as
i
pray
or
not,
without
prayed
hasn't
been
decided
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
does
that
--
what
does
that
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
so
what
was
passed
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
ask
whether
it'd
been
passed
on
or
not.
it
has
not
been
passed
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
haven't
said
they
wouldn't
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
that
would
may
--
would
probably
determine
a
reversion,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
do
you
think
the
attitude
that
georgia
court's
was
in
regard
to
the
resignation
that
it
was
required
because
of
the
restriction
in
the
will
or
that
the
city
was
just
up
for
the
resigning.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
could
the
dismissal
then
on
the
merits
that
went
through?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
could
the
dismissal
then
on
the
merits
if
what
you
said
was
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
dismissal?
do
you
contend
the
dismissal
was
on
the
merits?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
you're
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
greenberg
didn't
you
suggest
just
--
at
least
you
argue
in
your
brief
i
gather
that
except
for
that
section
69-504,
this
could
never
have
been
done
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
the
previous
law
of
georgia.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
--
is
there
any
--
there's
no
georgia
decision
against
you
on
that
point.
