mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
close
of
yesterday's
session
i
--
i
was
in
the
course
of
pointing
out
that
in
my
view
of
the
matter,
if
the
property
involved
in
this
case
were
furniture
or
tv
set,
we
would
not
be
here
at
all.
the
case
would
be
controlled
by
dameron
versus
brodhead
decided
in
1952.
but
in
this
case,
mississippi
claims
that
because
the
property
is
a
house
trailer
that
section
2
(b)
of
section
574
which
appears
--
the
text
which
appears
at
page
34
of
our
brief
is
applicable
to
the
case.
now
that
means
in
our
view,
that
mississippi
claims
that
the
house
trailer
is
a
motor
vehicle
because
the
proviso
applies
only
to
motor
vehicles.
it
also
means
that
mississippi
takes
the
view,
that
unless
there's
compliance
with
the
proviso
then
the
entire
immunity
of
section
574
is
lost.
that
is
to
say
that
unless
you
register
and
pay
licenses
with
your
home
state,
you
not
only
loose
the
immunity
from
the
licenses
and
registration
in
your
–
in
the
host
state
but
you
loose
also
the
immunity
from
ad
valorem
taxes
in
the
host
state.
now,
it
is
semantically
possible,
i
suppose,
that
the
act
can
be
read
that
way.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
takes
the
position
that
the
proviso
clause
applies
only
to
2
(b)
and
therefore,
he
said
that
it's
restriction
only
in
the
sense
that
if
you
do
not
pay
licenses
and
so
forth
in
your
home
state,
that's
all
that
you
loose
with
respect
to
the
host
state.
it
is
possible
that
the
act
could
be
read
that
the
way
mississippi
reads
it,
we
think
not.
now,
why
don't
we
think
so,
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place
because
every
time
congress
has
an
opportunity
to
deal
with
the
immunity
to
be
given
to
servicemen,
it
has
used
a
liberal
approach
towards
the
servicemen.
for
example,
the
original
1940
act
provided
no
immunity
whatsoever
with
reference
to
the
income
of
servicemen
in
another
state
when
they
were
there
on
the
military
orders
nor
does
it
provide
specifically
for
any
protection
against
taxation
of
the
movable
property
of
servicemen
in
the
host
state.
but
in
1942,
apparent
to
that
problem
was
giving
some
difficulty
and
so
congress
stepped
into
the
breach
and
said
that,
it's
[inaudible]
mr.
dameron
would
not
lose
his
immunity
because
of
change,
but
the
approach
taken
was
that
he
would
not
loose
his
domicile.
that
his
domicile
would
remain
the
same
and
it
was
hoped
that
in
that
way
they
would
avoid
the
state
taxes.
now,
the
1944
act
when
there
was
still
some
doubt
about
the
question
illustrates
again
the
congressional
intent
to
add
liberality
towards
the
servicemen
because
there
they
used
the
situs
test.
they
said
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
man
happens
to
be
in
another
state,
the
host
state,
under
military
orders
will
not
change
the
situs
of
his
property
for
taxation
purposes
to
the
new
state
and
therefore,
of
course,
the
situs
would
remain
in
the
old
state.
the
only
other
example
of
congressional
intent
that
we
have
is
the
congressional
action
of
1962
when
there
arose
a
question
as
to
where
the
situs
problem
that
might
be
when
the
serviceman
was
not
in
any
particular
state
as
it
happened
and
there
was
a
case
pending
in
a
lower
courts
and
congress
took
the
view
that
only
the
home
state
would
have
any
situs
with
respect
to
the
taxation
of
property.
now
this
court
also,
if
we
are
going
to
look
for
the
intent
of
congress
which
i
suggest
is
what
we're
doing
here
since
impossibly
is
ambiguity
from
the
standpoint
of
semantics,
when
you
look
at
the
intent
of
congress,
congress
always
has
taken
the
liberal
view,
but
so
has
this
court,
in
fact,
in
interpreting
the
rights
of
servicemen
under
the
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act.
first
example
of
that
was
in
the
leves
versus
leparoux
in
which
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
florida
statute
to
would
cut
off
a
serviceman's
right
to
redeem
his
property
which
had
been
sold
for
taxes.
it
so
happened
that
before
the
period
of
grace
had
run
out,
he
was
inducted
in
the
service
and
of
course
after
he
was
in
the
service
of
two,
three
months
left
of
the
good
period
of
grace
ran
out.
but
when
he
--
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
well,
i
think
so
your
honor.
it's
also
–
it
goes
to
what
congress
intended
to
do.
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
by
those
words.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
it
is
sir.
but
in
the
--
turning
back
to
the
leparoux
case
this
court
said
that
it
would
interpret
the
statute
with
friendly
eye
to
those
who
would
have
given
up
their
homes
and
so
forth
to
go
into
the
service
and
therefore,
applied
and
just
tolled
the
statute.
thus,
the
[inaudible]
the
florida
statute
in
that
case
cert
to
permit
relief.
now
in
dameron
versus
brodhead
which
is
a
leading
case
in
this
field,
although,
it
does
not
involve
an
automobile,
it
was
urged
upon
this
court
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
prevent
double
taxation
and
that
therefore
unless
double
taxation
appeared
to
be
a
fact
in
anyone
of
the
cases
that
the
immunity
would
not
apply.
this
court
rejected
that
contention
and
said
that
no
that
congress
had
chosen
the
broader
technique
of
just
simply
saying
the
soldiers'
domicile
had
not
changed
or
the
situs
of
his
property
had
not
changed
by
the
reason
of
enforced
movement.
i
think
they
said
that
because
obviously,
it
would
be
harder
to
administrate
--
administer
a
statute
when
a
soldier
might
move
several
times
in
the
course
year
and
the
best
way
to
do
it
was
to
say
that
only
at
the
one
place,
but
it
was
a
liberal
interpretation
in
favor
of
the
servicemen.
now,
furthermore
of
course
if
congress
had
intended
really
to
say
as
mississippi
contends
that
unless
you
pay
the
licenses,
fees
and
excises.
now,
you
lose
also
ad
valorem
protection
or
rather
protection
from
ad
valorem
taxes,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
proviso
could
have
read
precisely
that
way
and
instead
of
reading
as
it
does,
it
would
have
read
this
way,
“provided
all
licenses
fees,
excises,
and
ad
valorem
taxes
had
been
paid.”
now,
there's
no
question
about
it
and
mississippi
concedes,
the
attorney
general
does
and
the
supreme
court
does
in
mississippi,
that
what
we
have
involved
in
this
case
is
an
ad
valorem
tax.
it
is
true
and
it
is
taxed
on
to
as
commission
precedent
to
getting
a
license.
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
that's
correct
and
mississippi
and
the
supreme
court
conceded
that
and
the
attorney
general
as
i
understand
concedes
it
too.
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
would
because
we
concede
that
mississippi
and
all
states
have
a
police
interest
–-
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
this
is
involved
i
believe
in
the
next
case,
yes,
sir.
because
we
have
another
point
in
this
case
and
if
the
--
in
this
case,
we're
involved
here
with
house
trip
which
mississippi
says
with
a
motor
vehicle.
i
propose
to
address
myself
to
that
point
alone,
but
that's
why
i
think
the
two
cases
were
consolidated
and
considered
--
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
that's
correct,
that
is
correct
and
i
think
that
the
proviso
simply
is
that
in
order,
so
that
--
i
think
congress
intends
that
a
soldier
or
serviceman
would
have
to
register
in
licenses
vehicle
for
police
purposes.
we
can't
have
automobiles
running
around
without
any
kind
of
identification
at
all.
i
think
that's
exactly
what
they
meant
and
no
more.
so
they
said
you
must
pay
at
your
home
state
or
if
your
not
done
so
then
you
must
pay
at
your
host
state,
but
what
pay
what,
only
registration
and
license
fees.
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
only
motor
vehicle,
precisely.
now,
throughout
this
first
part
of
my
argument,
i
am
conceding
the
purpose
of
argument
that
we
had
to
these
house
trailers
motor
vehicle,
i
had
propose
to
--
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
it
was
actually
on
blocks.
it
had
wheels,
it
had
wheels.
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
if
actually
it
has
wheels
with
touching
ground.
and
i
certainly
will
say
this
that
it
could
have
been
moved
on
a
highway,
by
simply
taking
the
blocks
away
and
putting
a
power
unit
under
it.
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
it
got
there
in
another
taxable
year
by
being
towed
there
by
a
trailer.
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
on
its
own
wheels.
but
this
was
not
in
the
tax
year.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
house
trailer
ad
valorem
tax
act
which
what
we
are
dealing
with
came
into
affect
on
november
1,
1962
and
this
proceeding
begun
immediately
thereafter.
now
as
i
pointed
out,
all
of
the
above
is
only
assumption
that
the
house
trailer
isn't
motor
vehicle
within
section
2
of
the
federal
act.
we
do
not
actually
concede
that.
mississippi
analyzes
several
federal
statutes
because
there's
no
definition
of
motor
vehicle
in
this
particular
statute.
it
attempts
to
find
that
in
other
federal
statutes
the
term
motor
vehicle
is
define
as
including
a
trailer
in
which
to
point
out
i've
done
so
in
my
brief.
i
will
not
deliberate
here
that
the
federal
statutes
involved,
all
contemplates,
it
seems
to
me
a
movement
along
the
highways.
it
is
true
that
the
definition
is
broad
enough
to
cover
our
trailers,
but
all
these
trailers
attached
to
power
units.
now
with
every
federal
statute
that's
been
cited
deals
with
trailers
in
the
sense
that
there
are
moving,
that's
particularly
true
for
example
of
dyer
act.
i
don't
think
that
if
a
trailer
would
move
by
manpower,
physical
strength
and
not
by
a
power
unit
that
it
would
be
within
dyer
act
at
all.
so
my
point
is
that
those
statutes
from
which
mississippi
attempts
to
keep
a
meaning
that
trailers
are
included
within
the
term
“motor
vehicle”
i
do
not
think
aid
them
at
all
on
those
grounds.
now
turning
to
the
general
case
law
and
we've
analyzed
it
in
our
brief
also,
and
i
will
not
labor
the
cases
individually
here,
we
find
that
while
the
term
motor
vehicle
is
broader
than
the
term
automobile
which
literally
it
means
“mobile
by
its
own
power”
nevertheless,
it's
pretty
clear
in
insurance
cases
and
the
criminal
cases
and
then
other
types
of
cases,
that
a
trailer
standing
alone
is
never
regarded
as
a
motor
vehicle.
it
may
well
be
if
it's
attached
to
power
unit,
but
standing
alone
and
immobile,
it
is
never
so
far
as
i
know
that
--
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
its
$36.
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
but
of
course,
your
honor
will
perceive
that
this
case
is
not
about
$36.
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
it's
about
the
principle
as
to
whether
or
not
mississippi
and
many
other
states
can
tax
this
--
the
motor
vehicles
insofar
as
the
bizarre
cases
concerned
and
house
trailers
and
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
all
over
the
nation.
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
this
is
not
within
the
brief
but
you
asked
me
the
question
i
should
have.
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
it's
a
tax
case
both
of
these
are.
now
further
up,
let
me
make
one
point.
mississippi
itself
initiated
this
action
and
characterized
the
whole
proceeding
as
a
house
trailer
proceeding.
if
mississippi
did
not
have
a
motor
vehicle
statute
that
would
be
understandable
but
it
does
and
that
statute
has
interpreted
by
its
own
attorney
general
has
been
held
to
mean
that
as
to
a
motor
vehicle,
mississippi
recognizes
the
situs
theory
of
the
federal
act.
now
then,
why
did
mississippi
pass
a
new
act
dealing
with
house
trailers,
segregating
them
away
from
motor
vehicles
and
then
providing
that
they
shall
be
taxed
ad
valorem
because
it's
a
prerequisite
to
obtaining
the
license
and
omit
the
provision
which
it
has
in
his
motor
vehicle
act
that
they
shall
be
exempt?
i
suggest
that
it
was
done
solely
for
the
purpose
of
taxation
ad
valorem
wise
which
could
not
be
done
under
the
existing
motor
vehicle
act
of
mississippi.
now,
i
want
to
reserve
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal
so
i
make
one
final
point.
mississippi
supreme
court
based
its
opinion
large
in
this
case
upon
the
theory
that
section
574
is
based
upon
the
idea
of
double
taxation.
and
that
was
rejected
in
dameron
versus
brodhead
and
i
do
not
think
it
should
be
revived
at
this
time.
i
will
reserve
a
few
minutes
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
have
all
two
replies.
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
or
someone
asked
whether
the
highways
we
used
or
not,
whether
there
was
a
question
of
fact
on
that
point.
there
is
not.
at
page
25
of
the
record
there
is
the
affidavit
of
sergeant
snapp
that
he
figured
he
never
used
the
highways
and
the
case
crystallized
the
facts
of
the
case,
crystallized
at
that
point.
now,
i
have
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
was
done.
mr.
justice
brennan
asked,
what
will
it
consequence?
so
how
--
what
do
you
have
to
do
to
register
and
the
defendant
failed
say
that
one
other
things
you
got
to
do
is
to
register
is
to
pay
the
ad
valorem
tax.
you
can't
register
without
paying
ad
valorem
tax
and
that
is
section
58
of
the
house
bill
act
or
53.
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
it's
the
second
act.
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
yes,
at
the
third
carried
act
under
which
this
proceeding
is
brought.
you
cannot
register
without
having
paid
ad
valorem.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
must
register
by
mere
possession
and
of
course
as
far
as
that's
concerned,
we
have
to
pay
the
two
and
a
half,
that's
alright,
but
it's
the
ad
valorem.
we
recognize
that
as
a
police
control
device,
we
must
register
but
he
couldn't
register
without
paying
ad
valorem.
so
he
paid,
but
under
protest
in
order
to
protect
his
rights
here
and
he
had
urged
these
rights
--
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
no!
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
the
nature
of
tax
will
depend
on
the
fight
as
it
were
of
the
tax
and
if
it's
based
upon
the
value
is
ad
valorem,
no
matter
what
they
call.
in
other
words,
they
can't
get
away
from
the
protection
intended
by
congress
to
servicemen
by
labeling
their
own.
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
it
maybe
sir,
but
if
--
if
they
also
--
actually
for
the
purpose
of
revenue,
they
are
ad
valorem,
if
that
for
the
purpose
of
licensing
views
to
the
highway,
that's
a
different
thing.
we're
go
along
with
the
--
mr.
leon
hubert,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
say
that
it
should
be
done
differently.
it
should
--
i
said
that
under
574,
we
are
free
from
the
ad
valorem
tax.
although
as
a
police
measure,
in
case
this
where
the
highways
are
used,
we
exceed
to
the
proposition
that
congress
mention
must
