mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
i
think
involves
a
simple
part
of
law
and
so
far
as
i
know
no
questions
of
fact.
the
question
of
law
is
simply
whether
mississippi
in
this
particular
case
on
your
estate
can
collect
an
ad
valorem
public
tax
upon
a
property,
in
this
case,
a
motor
vehicle
or
a
house
trailer
in
this
particular
case
belonging
to
a
serviceman
who
does
not
reside
in
the
state
where
the
vehicle
happens
to
be
located.
you
will
recall
that
the
soldiers’
and
sailors’
relief
act
has
a
specific
provision
enacted
in
maybe
1942
with
some
amendments,
to
give
protection
to
servicemen
against
local
taxation
when
they
move
from
place
to
place
under
military
orders.
the
text
of
the
statute
is
to
be
found
in
our
brief,
appendix
a
at
page
33
and
34.
there
have
been
some
amendments
since
its
divi
--
divisional
enactment
in
1942
that
--
and
i
do
not
think
those
have
any
specific
value
except
showing
the
liberal
attitudes
of
congress
towards
the
servicemen.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
sergeant
snapp
is
a
resident
of/and
domiciliary
of
south
carolina
and
always
has
been
so
far
as
it's
pertinent
here.
he
was
under
military
orders
in
mississippi
of
some
considerable
term
prior
to
the
date
that
the
particular
tax
came
into
effect.
he
was
leaving
in
greenville,
mississippi
on
the
mil
--
military
orders
when
he
bought
a
trailer,
a
46-foot
house
trailer
which
he
used
as
his
home
at
the
greenville
air
force
base.
and
then
in
1961,
october
of
1961
he
had
that
trailer
moved
from
greenville
to
crystal
springs
air
force
base,
where
he
was
transferred
under
a
[inaudible].
so,
we
find
then
that
under
military
orders
living
in
his
trailer,
which
by
that
time
has
had
concrete
blocks
put
onto
it,
under
it,
although
it’s
still
capable
of
being
rolled
on
the
highways,
it
has
not
been
rolled
except
from
greenville
to
crystal
springs
at
anytime.
the
tax
date
in
question
here
is
november
1st
1962
which
incin
--
incidentally
is
the
date,
the
very
date
that
the
house
trailer
ad
valorem
tax
act
of
mississippi
which
had
been
enacted
in
june
1962
went
into
effect.
now,
on
that
date,
we
find
sergeant
snapp
that
full
living
in
his
trailer
at
crystal
springs,
a
domiciliary
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
and
all
through
the
period
that
we’re
talking
about,
that
situation
does
not
change
nor
it
does.
the
trailer
moved
upon
the
highways
of
mississippi
in
the
taxing
year
which
is
involved
in
this
particular
case.
now,
we
invite
your
attention
to
the
text
and
the
scope
and
the
intent
of
the
congress
and
in
acting
the
soldiers’
and
sailors’
relief
act
and
particularly
section
574.
i
might
say
that
the
history
of
that
act
indicates
this
that
when
the
war
broke
out
and
when
the
--
that
they
began
to
draft
great
many
men
the
old
1918,
relief
acts
were
adopted
to
some
extent,
or
revitalized
of
the
1940s
act.
but,
that
act
did
not
contain
any
relief
from
income
taxation
or
in
personal
property
taxation.
in
1942
it
was
seen
that
was
necessary
to
do
something
about
that,
so
that
there
was
a
provision
in
the
congress
something
like
19
--
like
section
574,
a
little
different
for
our
purposes.
it's
suffice
to
say
that
in
1944,
there
having
been
some
attempt
by
the
states
to
tax
the
property
generally
of
serviceman
within
the
borders
of
the
state.
congress
shows
that
as
this
court
said
in
dameron
versus
brodhead,
the
broad
technique
of
saying
that
when
a
soldier
was
within
the
physical
limits
of
the
states,
some
of
them
by
reason
of
the
military
orders
his
personal
property
would
not
be
regarded
as
having
any
situs
in
that
state.
and
in
1962
there
was
another
amendment
to
effect
that
the
only
situs
that
a
serviceman's
property
would
ever
have
would
be
the
situs
of
his
domicile
no
matter
where
the
--
he
was
in
any
state
at
all
or
not.
that
is
significant,
that
history
is
significant
we
believe
because
it
illustrates
that
whenever
congress
has
had
an
opportunity
to
--
or
seen
a
problem
relative
to
this
immunity
from
state
taxation
it
has
rest
itself
to
that
prob
--
problem
by
treatment
of
liberality
in
interpretation
than
otherwise.
now
let
us
turn
for
the
moment
to
the
tax
statute
involved
here?
mississippi
has
had
for
some
years
a
motor
vehicle
ad
valorem
property
tax.
that
tax
--
that
law,
however,
as
interpreted
by
the
attorney
general
of
mississippi
and
because
of
the
text
of
law
which
has
been
on
our
writ,
either
of
the
briefs
in
appendix
b
in
our
brief,
that
law
specifically
provides
that
if
a
serviceman
owning
an
automobile
drives
on
the
highways
of
the
state
to
such
an
extent
that
he
must
by
a
--
roads
and
bridges
tax
then
it
would
not
be
considered
as
having
a
situs
within
the
state.
therefore,
the
state
of
mississippi
not
only
by
legislation
requires
attorney
general's
opinion
on
the
subject
and
ruling
on
the
subject
which
is
also
found
in
our
appendix
e
and
it’s
already
ruled
that
if
this
one
automobile
that
there
would
be
no
tax
on
it.
it
is
significant
therefore,
and
that
was
the
ruling
in
1958,
we
think
it's
significant
therefore
that
in
1962,
june
of
1962
mississippi
legislature
enacted
a
new
law
dealing
with
house
trailers
specifically,
although
the
definition
of
motor
vehicle
in
the
old
act
was
broad
enough
to
cover
house
trailers
because
the
definition
said
that
it
was
a
vehicle
either
automated
by
its
own
power
or
drawn
by
the
power
except
human
power,
so
that
a
house
trailer
was
within
the
1958
motor
vehicle
act,
but
mississippi
in
1962
elected
to
pass
another
statute
which
says
that
house
trailers
shall
be
taxed
and
that
there
shall
be
a
registration
fee
of
$2.50
which
registration
fee
cannot
be
obtained
and
which
registration
certificate
cannot
be
obtained
without
pre-payment
the
ad
valorem
taxes
fixed
according
to
a
schedule
which
is
set
up
under
the
act
and
which
roughly
relates
to
various,
on
automobiles
and
goes
to
the
states,
the
state
tax
commission
ultimately
did
provide
such
schedule.
at
that
point
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
your
honor
to
register
it,
sir,
you
have
to
get
the
ad
valorem.
now,
as
to
a
license
plate
for
it,
it's
probable
that
you
have
to
comply
with
another
act,
in
other
words,
there
are
three
possible
things
here.
one,
you
must
register
whether
you
ride
to
the
roads
or
not.
in
that
case
you
must,
and
it's
a
prerequisite
that
pay
the
ad
valorem
tax.
the
other
is
it
doesn't
seem
to
relate
to
ad
valorem
law
but
it
does
contemplate
that
there's
a
rolling
on
the
highway
which
would
also
be
a
truth
under
the
house
trailer
act
as
well.
now,
sergeant
snapp,
and
this
is
important
because
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
yes
sir.
both
the
state
court
said
it's
an
ad
valorem
tax
and
mississippi
says
it's
not
an
ad
valorem
tax.
we'll
agree
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
there
would
be
no
probability
element
in
this
case
nor
would
it
be
here
if
this
property
were
[inaudible]
because
dameron
versus
brodhead
has
already
decided
that.
this
court
decided
that
case,
it
was
decided
i
think
in
1952.
mr.
justice
clark
i
think
and
only
mr.
justice
douglas
were
on
the
court,
and
mr.
justice
black,
i
beg
your
pardon
was
also
there.
in
any
case
dameron
versus
brodhead
knocked
out
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
applicability
of
this
statute
dependent
upon
the
possibility
or
the
reality
of
double
taxation
and
said
that
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
at
all
because
in
dameron
versus
brodhead
the
tax
involved
was
an
ad
valorem
tax
in
the
state
of
colorado
upon
the
resident
of
louisiana
and
louisiana
had
no
tax
of
that
nature
upon
his
property.
let's
assume
this
would
be
no
problem
at
all,
again,
it
went
up
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
motor
vehicle
involved
or
a
house
trailer
that
we
do
not
concede
by
the
way
in
this
case
except
it's
now
in
proposition
that
the
vehicle
here
is
in
fact
a
motor
vehicle.
but
if
you
will
note
section
2
of
the
federal
act
which
is
on
page
34,
it
says,
for
purposes
of
--
throughout
the
defining
property
within
this
act
automobiles,
motor
vehicles
are
included,
and
then
it
says
for
purposes
of
–
the
term
taxation
shall
included
but
shall
not
be
limited
to
licenses,
fees
and
excises
then
there's
a
proviso
clause,
provided
that
the
licenses,
fees
and
excise
required
to
be
paid
by
the
home
state
have
been
paid.
otherwise,
you
don't
get
any
exception
and
there's
that
part.
mississippi
says,
“you
must
comply
with
this
requirement
of
registration
and
licensing
in
your
home
state
or
you
loose
the
entire
immunity,
including
the
ad
valorem
immunity.”
our
reply,
“that
is
why,
no.
if
we
have
not
complied
with
the
proviso
to
which
getting
registration
and
getting
perhaps
a
license
then
those
things
we
must
pay
indeed
to
the
host
state
but
not
ad
valorem.”
there
indeed
is
the
problem.
it
maybe,
that
it
is
really
symmetric.
you
can
actually
read
the
proviso
clause
as
the
solicitor
general
has
in
a
supporting
briefs
supporting
what
i've
cited,
he
reads
the
proviso
clause
as
the
proviso
to
the
second
part
of
section
a
--
2
of
the
federal
act.
in
other
words,
you
have
the
federal
act
which
says
it
defines
property
of
section
a
and
defines
taxation
in
section
b
and
then
at
the
proviso.
the
solicitor
general
says,
“we
agree
with
him
that
the
proviso
only
knocks
out
the
exception
in
taxation
--
in
b.”
those
it
couldn't
be
written
all
the
way
in
mississippi
so
reads
it
that
is
all
of
the
immunity
is
lost.
now,
the
question
is
which
interpretation
should
prevail.
i've
already
suggested
to
the
court
that
the
congress
has
been
liberal
every
time
it
had
had
occasion
to
deal
with
the
soldier.
i
suggest
to
the
court
also
that
in
dameron
versus
brodhead,
this
court
having
problem
of
whether
or
not
double
taxation
which
was
undoubtedly
the
original
purpose
of
the
act
was
a
sine
qua
non
for
relief,
said,
“why,
no?”
but
the
court
--
this
court's
said
“the
congress
had
chosen
the
broader
technique
of
dealing
with
this
matter,
i
think
solidly
because
of
these
great
administrative
problems
never
have
otherwise
exist.
