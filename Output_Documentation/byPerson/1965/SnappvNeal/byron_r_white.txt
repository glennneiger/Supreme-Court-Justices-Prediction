r.
white
well,
if
this
was
a
–
if
these
were
a
license
fee
or
registration
fee
for
a
motor
vehicle,
you
would
concede
mississippi
could
impose
it
i
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
involved
–
this
is
involved
in
the
case
next,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
–
you
just
say
that
ad
valorem
tax
couldn't
–
can't
be
can
imposed
by
mississippi
on
either
a
motor
vehicle
or
non-motor
vehicle?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
a
motor
vehicle?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
did
it
get
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
its
own
wheels?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
--
assuming
that
--
assuming
this
was
registerable
as
a
motor
vehicle,
why
didn't
you
just
collect
the
motor
vehicle
fee
rather
than
the
--
an
impose
a
personal
property
tax?
is
this
the
only
device
you
got
to
collect
your
motor
vehicle
fee
under
the
name
of
--
i
mean
you
can't
go
recover
and
make
the
person
pay
his
the
registration
fee
if
it's
registerable?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
why
--
why
go
to
the
personal
property
tax
if
you
use
it
--
why
should
you
be
any
more
able
to
put
a
personal
property
tax
on
a
automobile
then
on
a
bedroom
furniture?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
failure
to
have
--
the
failure
to
register
takes
the
--
takes
this
automobile
out
of
the
definition
of
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
–
that
isn't
particularly
at
issue
here,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
question,
is
not
whether
you
can
make
him
register
this
house
trailer
but
whether
you
can
tax
it
as
personal
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
do
about
other
people
in
mississippi
if
don't
register
their
cars?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
much
is
the
personal
property
tax
did
you
assess?
justice
byron
r.
white
$36.50
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
--
and
then
how
much
would
have
been
cost
him
to
register
this
house
trailer?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
would
have
to
be
--
don't
you
have
a
license
fee
in
addition?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
--
that's
the
total?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
his
reason
in
this
case,
is
that
the
first
or
the
second?
justice
byron
r.
white
house
bill
act
–
that's
the
third
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
specific
calling
of
ad
valorem
what
if
mississippi
has
just
said
that
this
is
a
registration
tax
or
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
lot
of
the
--
lot
of
registration
taxes
are
out
of
info
service
are
keeping
that
as
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
saying
--
are
you
saying
that
we
should
treat
the
states'
right
to
--
to
impose
an
ad
valorem
--
ad
valorem
tax
the
same
way
as
a
