is
that
it?

is
that
right?
it
was
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
was
elevated
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.

may
i
–
may
i
just
ask
a
question
of
curiosity.
how
much
money
is
involved
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
$36.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
would

not.
would

j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
--
like
many
military
men

--
justice

brennan,
jr.
--
is

may
i
get
that
attorney
general?
justice

j.
brennan,
jr.
under
your
first
act,
if
--
it
was
not
something
that
had
to

registered
as
you
suggested
in
answer
to
chief

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
answer
to
chief
justice
said
in
the
case
of
the
automobile
is
not
used
and
just
garaged
for
the
whole
year
–-
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
would
not
have
to
be
registered?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
that
–
my
question
is
would
that
had
been
taxable
under
the
ad
valorem
tax
law
as
it
then
stood?
