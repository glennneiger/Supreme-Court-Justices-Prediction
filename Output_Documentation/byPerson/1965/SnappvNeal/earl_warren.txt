snapp,
petitioner,
versus
honorable
w.
d.
neal,
state
auditor,
et
al.
mr.
hubert?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
state
auditor,
et
al.
mr.
hubert,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
mclendon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
this
was
a
--
if
this
happened
to
be
an
automobile
mr.
mclendon
and
it
had
not
been
used
on
the
highways
throughout
the
taxable
year,
would
registration
have
been
required?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
not
have.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
this
trailer
have
never
been
on
a
highway
in
the
taxable
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
proceeding
taxable
year,
but
supposed
you
have
an
old
automobile
that
you
had
for
five
or
six
years
and
you
just
decided
to
retire
it
and
it
was
in
your
backyard
for
an
entire
year,
would
it
be
taxable?
would
you
have
to
register
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
how
do
you
differentiate
that
from
a
trailer
that
has
been
in
place
for
a
solid
year
and
has
not
been
on
the
highway
during
the
taxable
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
suppose
an
old
automobile
could
too,
but
if
didn't
go
on
the
highway?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
and
counsel
agreed
that
this
trailer
did
not
operate
on
the
highway
during
the
taxable
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
would
think
that
if
–
whether
it
used
the
highway
or
not,
it
was
immaterial
that
these
people
who
have
the
old
automobile
junkyards,
where
they
have
hundreds,
and
hundreds
of
automobiles
that
have
been
prior
to
years
operated
on
the
highways,
but
were
not
operating
it
in
the
current
year
–-
chief
justice
earl
warren
-–
would
have
staggering
taxes
to
pay
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
suppose
they
pay
them,
do
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
from
personal
property,
ad
valorem,
yes,
but
i'm
talking
about
operating
as
--
a
license
operating
as
a
motor
vehicle.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
couldn't
have
to.
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
distinguish
that
then
from
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
finish
your
sentence,
it's
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hubert?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
