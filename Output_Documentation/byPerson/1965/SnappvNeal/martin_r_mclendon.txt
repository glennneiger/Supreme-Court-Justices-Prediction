mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
brennan
coming
up
with
a
total
amount
involved
here
of
course
the
state's
part
is
less
than
$2
and
i
feel
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
yes,
sir.
i
feel
very
much
likely
just
we
laid
–
it
was
in
a
lawyer's
office
trying
to
settle
the
affairs
of
her
deceased
husband
who
is
a
successful
businessman
who
have
wide
and
extensive
business
interests.
and
after
she
had
listened
to
her
meticulous
lawyer
explain
all
of
things
that
she
would
have
to
do
for
several
hours
as
she
finally
sit
back
in
a
chair
inside
if
i
had
known
its
going
to
be
this
much
trouble,
i
just
would
rather
he
wouldn't
have
died.
so
that
we
had
any
idea
that
it
was
going
to
be
this
much
trouble
and
it
probably
would
have
given
them
$2
to
begin
with.
but
we
all
know,
no
one
knows
better
than
this
court
that
principles
of
taxation
and
state
government,
taxation
being
the
very
life
blood
of
state
government,
cannot
be
surrendered
for
the
personal
convenience
of
those
people
who
happen
to
be
charged
with
administering,
so
that
at
that
time.
this
court
held
as
long
ago
as
mcculloch
versus
maryland
that
a
state
had
a
right
to
tax
everything
within
its
boundaries.
it
very
recently
not
too
recently
but
recently
cited
that
that
case
gray
versus
medler
where
it
even
held
at
new
york
had
the
right
to
tax
intangibles
found
in
that
state.
and
of
course
as
this
court
well
knows
that's
held
on
many
different
occasions
that
exemptions
and
exceptions
from
taxation
are
the
exception
and
not
the
rule.
taxation
is
the
rule
and
exceptions
and
exemptions
are
the
exception.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well,
i
say
this
that
two
members
of
this
present
court
saw
a
constitutional
question
when
they
dissented
from
the
original
opinion
in
dameron
versus
brodhead
case.
but
i
see
a
basic,
we're
not
questioning
the
right
of
congress
because
the
majority
of
the
court
in
that
case
held
at
congress
had
that
right,
but,
we
are
saying
that
in
the
absence
if
that
federal
act
if
this
court
is
not
called
upon
to
construe
section
514,
the
second
paragraph,
the
second
numbered
paragraph,
if
this
court
is
not
called
on
to
construe
it,
if
it
does
not
grant
absolute
immunity
from
taxation,
the
tax
imposed
in
the
case
by
mississippi
is
a
valid
exercise
of
sovereignty
to
that
extent
we
say
its
constitutional
issue
your
honor.
now
in
dameron
versus
brodhead,
we
think
the
significant
language
insofar
as
this
particular
case
is
concerned
is
found
on
page
325
of
the
official
report
where
the
court
said,
“congress
had
that
valid
right
because
of
the
military
assignment.”
the
court
said,
“what
has
been
said
in
no
way
affects
the
reserved
powers
of
the
states
to
tax
for
the
statute
merely
states
that
the
taxable
domicile
of
serviceman
shall
not
be
changed
by
a
military
assignment.”
that
the
majority
thought
that
congress
had
the
right
to
do
and
we
are
not
here
questioning
that
opinion,
although,
we
point
out
that
it
was
a
close
question
at
that
time.
now,
we
assume
that
the
court
has
looked
at
by
now,
it's
repeated
several
times,
it's
in
my
original
opinion
to
the
state
auditor,
its
in
the
supreme
court
opinion
in
abbreviated
form,
it's
in
exhibit
a
to
both
the
government's
amicus
curiae
brief
and
exhibit
a
to
the
petitioner's
brief.
the
statute
in
question
and
it
says
for
the
purposes
of
taxation,
“the
soldier
may
leave
home
and
take
his
property
within
but
his
property
never
leaves
home.”
now,
the
court
below
held
that
that
was
a
legal
fiction
and
in
all
cases
by
virtue
of
dameron
versus
brodhead
in
all
cases,
it
would
apply
except
motor
vehicles.
now
the
congress,
i'm
getting
into
the
legislative
history,
although
the
government
says,
there
is
no
legislative
history,
we
have
a
found
some,
the
congress
added
a
second
section
to
514
of
the
soldier's
and
sailor's
civil
relief
act
and
that
second
section
provided
that
the
first
section
would
apply
to
personal
property,
including
motor
vehicles
and
it
would
include
licenses,
fees,
and
excise
paid
on
those
motor
vehicles.
the
words
are
these,
“it
shall
include
but
not
be
limited
to.”
now,
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
held
that
the
inclusion
of
the
two
grand
fields
of
taxation
that
is
licenses
and
excises
and
that
the
words
not
be
limited
to
proceeding
that
necessarily
included
ad
valorem.
and
this
court
so
held
in
dameron
versus
brodhead
and
said,
“ad
valorem
was
excluded.”
now,
the
point
we
are
making
is
that
provided
the
license,
fee
or
excise
required
by
the
laws
of
the
home
state
have
been
paid.
now,
we
get
into
the
matter
of
where
the
registered
or
unregistered
automobiles
would
be
permitted
to
go
up
and
down
highways
and
streets.
now
in
addition,
one
more
in
legislative
history
if
the
court
please,
the
congress
was
considering
as
it
shown
by
exhibit
h
to
the
petitioner's
brief
a
statute
that
would
have
granted
absolute
immunity
from
taxation
of
all
sorts
to
servicemen.
now
that
act
was
submitted
by
the
chairman
of
the
house
committee
on
military
affairs
to
the
judge
advocate
general's
department
of
the
war
department
and
as
the
secretary
of
war
was
asked,
i
mean,
they
asked
for
advice
and
recommendations.
now,
those
--
that
advice
and
recommendations
came
back
in
the
form
of
a
substitute
bill
which
they
recommended
passed
or
be
passed
and
congress
without
changing
a
word
or
a
punctuation
marked
passed
it.
so
that's
the
law
we're
dealing
with.
not
the
one
that
would
have
granted
absolute
immunity
from
taxation,
but
the
one
that
the
war
department
drafted
for
the
congress
and
it
had
this
proviso
in
it.
now,
the
u.
s.
justice
department
there
are
some
reasoning
that
eludes
me,
could
try
to
construe
that
proviso
as
being
limited
to
–
don't
even
--
trying
to
limit
it
beyond
its
own
terms.
but
this
court
has
held
in
numerous
occasions
that
proviso
--
a
proviso
in
a
statute
limits
the
affect
of
the
enactment
clause.
we
treat
with
that
on
page
8
of
our
brief
and
the
court
held
that
the
illogical
and
grammatical
scope
of
a
proviso
applied
to
the
principle
clause,
that
is
in
this
case
section
1,
numbered
1.
in
other
words,
section
2
includes
by
its
terms
and
applies
to
motor
vehicles
provided
the
license,
fee
or
excise
required
by
the
laws
of
the
home
state
of
the
serviceman
have
been
paid.
now,
our
view
of
this
particular
matter
is
not
new.
mississippi's
view
of
it
is
not
new.
in
fact,
in
my
recent
opinion
i
relied
very
heavily
on
the
supreme
court
decision
of
the
state
of
virginia.
that
decision
you
see
portsmouth
had
levied
a
license
fee
for
this
support
of
the
city
government
of
portsmouth
and
the
serviceman
attempted
through
the
application
of
section
514
of
the
soldier's
and
sailor's
civil
relief
act
to
avoid
the
payment
of
that
$10
license
fee.
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
said
that,
section
2
since
he
was
registered,
his
automobile
was
registered
in
the
state
of
virginia,
he
was
subject
to
that
license,
that
$10
license
that
was
applied
by
the
city
of
portsmouth.
now,
it's
been
stated
here
that
congress
amended
the
act
several
times.
this
particular
act
has
been
amended,
it
was
amended
in
1940
and
that
was
the
amendment
the
legislative
history
that
i
just
discussed.
it
was
amended
again
in
1962.
now,
this
whitehead
case
was
decided
in
1961
by
the
highest
appellate
court
of
virginia
and
the
congress,
certainly
the
military
with
full
knowledge
of
that
reported
opinion
asked
the
congress
to
amend
section
1
to
relieve
a
serviceman
domiciled
in
new
jersey
from
having
to
pay
taxes
because
he
was
overseas.
he
had
left
his
duty
state
and
left
his
family
in
virginia.
the
district
court
held
at
the
taxes
were
due.
the
court
of
appeals
in
reviewing
that
case
observed
that
congress
amended
section
1
of
the
act
to
clarify
its
original
intent.
now,
my
point
there
is
certainly
the
supreme
court
of
virginia's
interpretation
of
that
statute
couldn't
be
binding
on
this
court,
but
we
submit
that
it's
persuasive.
there
is
a
court
that
has
delivered
and
looked
in
to
this
proviso
and
held
that
the
serviceman
had
a
right
and
he
has
an
absolute
right.
he
has
a
right
that
the
members
of
this
court
don't
him
have
and
that
is
to
register
the
automobiles
back
in
their
home
state.
and
our
position
is
that
that
right
is
given
him
by
a
congress
and
he
can
do
it.
and
no
matter
where
he
goes
in
the
service
of
this
country
his
home
state
license
is
valid
and
he
can
successful
defend
a
prosecution
for
improper
driver's
licenses
or
anything
else
based
on
section
514
of
the
soldier's
and
sailor's
civil
relief
act.
our
further
position
is
that
unless
he
himself
does
that,
voluntarily
registers
in
his
home
state,
he
subjects
himself
to
the
registration
licensing
and
taxing
laws
of
the
state
where
he
is
found.
and
we
think
that's
a
reasonable
construction
to
be
placed
on
this
federal
statute
and
we
think
it
is
a
proper
construction
to
be
placed
on
this
federal
statute.
we
think
the
federal
statute
certainly
is
controlling.
if
it
grants
--
if
this
court
holds
that
it
grants
absolute
immunity,
then
we're
through.
we
don't
even
have
to
consider
it
further.
but
we
submit
that
it
does
not
grant
absolute
immunity
insofar
as
motor
vehicles
are
concerned.
we
admit
that
has
been
illustrated
on
a
paean
or
any
other
item
of
household
goods,
it
does
as
interpreted
by
dameron
versus
brodhead
grants
an
exception
from
ad
valorem
taxes.
now,
we
think
that
the
court's
interpretation
of
section
514
will
be
dispositive
of
the
matter,
but
we
do
for
the
court's
assistance
we
hope,
we
want
to
discuss
some
mississippi
statutes.
they
are
both
set
forth
both
of
the
pertinent
statutes
are
set
forth
as
appendix
to
our
brief
and
they
been
referred
to
or
eluded
to
in
part.
the
mississippi
statutes
are
material
to
this
case
and
the
court's
determination
of
this
case
were
two
points
and
two
points
only.
alternative
one,
mississippi
made
a
good
faith
effort
to
induce
this
man
to
register
his
auto
–
his
house
trailer
in
mississippi
and
that
he
failed
and
refused
to
do.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
the
registration
entails
filing
an
application
furnishing
with
necessary
information
concerning
year,
date,
and
model
purchase
price
to
take
care
of
the
sales
tax
features
and
the
address
of
the
registered
motor
number,
and
things
like
that,
in
other
words,
regular
police
registration.
it
involves
a
fee
varying
from
over
a
few
dollars
up
to
possibly
well
on
trucks
and
other
things
it's
quite
expensive
but
on
personal
motor
vehicles.
in
this
particular
case,
that
trailer
could
have
been
registered
in
mississippi
for
$10
and
if
it
had
been
registered
in
mississippi
by
the
payment
of
the
fee
of
$10
under
the
first
mississippi
statute
that
i'm
going
to
discuss,
there
would
have
been
exempt
from
that
ad
valorem
tax.
now,
there
the
serviceman
had
not
--
by
that
i
mean
this,
in
mississippi
in
1958
the
constitution
was
amended
in
1956
to
authorize
a
special
mode
of
assessment
and
levy
ad
valorem
taxes
on
motor
vehicles.
and
the
legislation
58
set
up
an
elaborate
system
for
assessing
those
things.
it's
something
new
i
don't
know
what
other
states
might
have
follow
it.
it
sends
to
connote
that
we
that
we
started
it
sales
taxes
in
regards
to
the
depression
and
now
the
district
of
columbia
has
adopted
it.
so,
it
maybe
a
far,
far
reaching
thing
at
least
we
thought
it
was
a
looking
forward.
now
my
point,
the
--
in
recognition
of
the
soldiers
and
sailor's
civil
relief
act,
section
21
of
that
act
provides
that
any
automobile
operated
on
the
streets,
highways
of
mississippi,
so
that
it
would
be
required
or
should,
i
don't
know
the
exact
word
but
they
are
there,
be
required
to
register,
to
pay
motor
road
and
bridge
privilege
license
would
be
exempt
from
the
ad
valorem
pitches
of
that
act.
now,
this
as
i
say
sergeant
snapp
failed,
declined
and
refuse
to
do
a
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
your
honor,
there's
a
possibility
that
it
wouldn't
have,
no.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
that's
right.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
in
the
taxable
year,
yes.
it's
a
stated
on
oath
that
it
was
in
was
on
the
highway
during
the
preceding
taxable
year
and
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well,
the
differ
–
well,
the
differentiation
in
this
case
your
honor,
is
that
factually
this
particular
trailer
could
have
at
anytime
been
driven
on
the
highways.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
i
recognize
the
analogy
that
you're
using
you
honor
if
you
–
if
you
permit
me.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
the
--
it
had
been
used,
admitted
on
oath.
in
other
words,
the
state
of
mississippi
could
have
elected
to
prosecute
him
for
having
driven
down
the
highway
with
this
trailer
without
being
registered,
they
elected
to
tax
him
instead.
it
had
been
and
it
could
be
at
any
time.
now,
this
second
mississippi
statute
that
i'm
coming
to
was
designed
to
cover
that
particular
type
situation
where
the
trailer
is
pulled
up
on
a
trailer
house,
a
yard
and
its
--
and
all
the
members
of
the
court
have
observed
the
trailers
have
become
--
i
mean,
its
big
business.
people
use
them
for
home,
year
in,
and
year
out.
and
the
second
ad
valorem
act
of
law
of
tax
act
that
this
tax
was
levied
on
him
was
designed
to
cover
that
particular
thing.
in
other
words,
it
was
--
if
i
may
point
out
that
the
first
act
depended
entirely
upon
the
motor
vehicle
registration
statutes
for
its
effectiveness
and
as
your
honor
pointed
out
an
old
automobile
or
a
new
trailer
would
be
exempt.
the
second
act
was
designed
as
the
--
in
the
language
of
the
layman
to
cover
a
loop
hole
in
the
law
because
they
were
5,
6,
$7,000
house
trailers
sitting
up
on
parking
lots.
people
were
living
in
them
as
homes,
they
were
never
used
on
the
highways
and
they
were
escaping
all
taxation.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well,
my
suggestion
was
--
for
that
--
now
that
is
--
there
is
a
--
my
suggestion
on
that
was
that
it
had
--
the
man
had
been
under
a
duty
to
register
prior
to
that
and
if
he
was
ever
going
to
use
it
on
a
highway
again,
he
was
under
a
duty
to
register
and
that
is
the
statute
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
exactly.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
under
the
motor
vehicle
license
statute.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
it
would
have
been
taxable
under
the
old
archaic
ad
valorem
tax
law
that
was
deprived,
i
mean
derived
from
the
tax
law
dealing
with
real
property.
and
of
course
that
was
what
the
reason
for
the
adoption
of
chapter
v,
88
laws
of
1958
was
because
mississippi
found
that
that
archaic
system
of
back
assessment
was
not
adequate
to
cover
highly
mobile
property
in
the
nature
of
motor
vehicle.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well,
there's
--
we've
changed
a
few
words
in
our
brief
on
it
that
frankly
we
don't
know.
the
tax
if
it
were
paid
in
advance
and
whether
did
or
did
not,
i
do
not
know.
i
mean,
we
--
my
answer
to
his
assertion
that
it
was
not
was
it,
it
was
capable
of
it.
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
held
had
previously
used
the
highways
when
ever
the
need
arose
and
that
speculation
as
to
whether
it
did
or
did
not
was
not
material
because
as
we
point
out,
in
recognition
of
section
514,
mississippi
granted
an
ad
valorem
tax
exemption.
now,
we
--
if
under
our
view
of
the
proper
interpretation
of
514
and
if
that
is
proper,
mississippi
didn't
have
to
grant
that
the
exemption.
as
i
say
it
was
an
inducement
to
get
these
servicemen
to
waive
their
federal
right
by
registering
in
mississippi
where
the
automobiles
were
being
used.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well,
they
do.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
if
the
assessor
is
properly
performing
his
duty.
the
assessors
has
to
own
their
personal
property
just
like
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
no
not
that
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
no,
sir.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
my
distinction
on
that
your
honor
is
that,
it
was
capable
of
being
moved.
it
had
been
moved
and
no
registration
fee
had
ever
attempted
to
--
been
purchased.
as
i
point
out
in
the
beginning,
we
could
own
the
sworn
statements
in
this
record,
mississippi
has
a
criminal
prosecution
against
it.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
yes,
we
can
your
honor.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well
as
i
say
under
our
interpretation
of
the
congressional
act,
we
have
that
right.
if
we're
wrong
in
that
of
course
the
court
has
the
final
say.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
no.
its
--
i
think
it's
a
special
mode
of
tax
for
a
special
item
of
property.
i
don't
think
it
takes
you
--
takes
it
out
of
the
definition
of
property,
no,
sir.
now,
why
the
local
sheriff
assessed
under
this
act
instead
of
assessing
the
penalties
under
the
other
statute,
i
--
i
don't
know
but
it
did
and
the
tax,
of
course,
it
was
paid
as
the
tax
it
was
due
under
chapter
535
laws
of
1962.
and
now,
we
get
into
it
if
we
have
a
time
remain
the
fact
that
this
under
our
view
is
a
motor
vehicle
under
the
meaning
of
those
two
statutes.
as
i
say
the
statute
that
granted
the
ad
valorem
tax
exemption
defined
motor
vehicle
as
anything
driven
on
the
highways
with
other
than
muscular
power
and
certainly
that
inclusions.
we
take
the
position
that
he
was
under
a
duty
to
register
that
house
trailer
and
all
of
the
house
trailer
--
i
mean,
of
course
this
tax
but
this
particular
one.
he
was
under
a
duty
to
register
under
that
statute,
he
didn't
do
it.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
only
in
definition,
your
honor,
in
taking
the
position
now,
that
it
is
not
a
motor
vehicle.
we
take
the
position
now
that
a
sworn
statement
said
that
those
two
statutes
apply
and
therefore
by
the
application
of
those
two
statutes
and
the
statutory
definition
contained
therein
is
bound
by
his
own
sworn
statement.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
that's
right.
and
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
beginning
of
this
argument
mr.
justice
white,
that
statute
is
being
discussed
not
because
it
has
any
binding
of
faith.
we
submit
that
this
court's
interpretation
of
section
514
of
this
soldiers'
and
sailors'
civil
relief
act
will
be
determined.
if
this
court
hold
it,
the
proviso
means
nothing,
the
states
will
do
the
best
they
can
to
try
to
get
them
registered.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
military
personnel
will
be
free
to
elect
whether
they
register
the
motor
vehicles
or
not
register
them
at
all.
but
the
--
and
as
i
say
that
is
only
being
discussed
at
this
time
to
show
a
good
faith
effort
on
the
part
of
mississippi.
this
man
had
the
right
to
register
in
south
carolina.
there's
no
question
about
that
and
there's
no
question
i
don't
think
from
south
carolina
statute
said
there
in
the
petitioner's
brief
cited
and
referred
to
in
our
brief
that
he
was
needed
to
be
registered
there.
they
came
out
with
an
argument
at
one
time
but
seem
to
abandoned
it
that
the
--
this
was
when
the
justice
department
was
still
handling
this
case,
that
the
federal
statute
placed
it
in
south
carolina
but
it
was
physically
in
mississippi.
but
it
wouldn't
liable
for
mississippi
tax,
because
it
was
physically
in
south
carolina
but
it
was
not
liable
for
south
carolina
tax,
because
it
was
still
physically
in
mississippi.
and
as
i
say
the
supreme
court
rejected
that
carnival
shell
game
and
i
think
this
court
certainly
will
too.
but
that
man
had
an
absolute
right
to
register
in
south
carolina.
we
don't
question
that
and
if
he
had,
we
couldn't
have
done
single
by
it.
of
course,
we
couldn't
regulate
his
civil
conduct
but
we
could
not
have
required
further
registration.
now,
we
say
supreme
court
said
that,
he
failed
to
comply
with
terms
that
proviso
and
therefore
mississippi
acts
of
material.
now
the
first
mississippi
statute,
we
discussed
and
offer
for
this
court's
consideration
and
it's
copied
in
full
in
our
brief
to
show
a
good
faith
effort
on
the
part
of
mississippi
to
get
it
come
on
down
to
register.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
now,
we
gave
him
that
opportunity
and
now
he's
asking
this
court
to
strike
down
the
second
statute.
now,
how
far
when
mississippi
have
to
go,
that's
my
question
to
these
gentlemen
representing
the
judge
advocate
general's
office
of
the
airforce,
how
far
does
mississippi
have
to
go?
short
of
putting
these
servicemen
in
jail
for
not
registering
the
car,
that's
what
california
did,
they
fined
them,
but
how
far
will
mississippi
have
to
go
to
induce
them
to
register
their
personally
owned
motor
vehicles
and
house
trailers
in
mississippi?
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
there
are
general
sanctions
of
course
in
the
registration
statutes
and
the
ad
valorem
features
have
penalty
at
all
points.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
total
personal
private
tax
on
this
particular
case
is
$36.50.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
$36
and
then
--
that
the
registration
fee
in
that
statute
of
$2.50.
yes,
sir.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
they
get
it
registered
under
the
regular
motor
vehicle
statutes
and
have
paid
a
fee
of
$10.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
that
is
the
license
fee.
yes,
sir.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
that's
the
total.
whether
it
might
be
a
tag
fee
of
$2
but
it
was
--
there's
[inaudible]
and
that
as
i
say
that
the
only
reason
we
discuss
this,
we
don't
think
its
controlling
certainly
not
on
this
scope
but
we
do
think
it
is
persuasive
of
mississippi's
good
faith
to
induce
them
to
register.
now,
mr.
hubert
hurled
out
a
challenge
in
his
last
reply
that
we
didn't
in
having
an
opportunity
to
answer
in
normal
rules
of
this
court,
a
written
of
answer.
he
says
that
the
motor
vehicle
registration
statutes,
the
regular
statutes,
were
put
in
this
case
for
the
first
time.
i
want
to
ask
him,
he
is
got
a
few
minutes
left,
what
do
you
think
i
referred
to
on
page
30
of
the
record
when
i
told
him
that
they
have
waived
that
right
and
what
does
he
think
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
--
excuse
me,
i'm
very
sorry.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
what
he
thinks
a
supreme
court
of
mississippi
said
when
it
held
on
two
different
occasions
that
the
man
had
waived
his
right
to
register
under
mississippi's
ordinary
motor
vehicle
statutes
because
as
i
point
it
out
of
chapter
588
contains
no
registration
features.
it
depends
entirely
upon
the
regular
motor
vehicle
registration
statutes.
thank
you
for
the
extra
minute
your
honor.
