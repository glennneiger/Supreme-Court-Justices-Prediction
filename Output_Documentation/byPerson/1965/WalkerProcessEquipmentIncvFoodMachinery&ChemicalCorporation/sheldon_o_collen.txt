mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
i
think
what
is
really
necessary
for
the
court
to
understand
why
this
particular
case
is
here,
is
for
us
to
review
briefly
the
pleadings
because
the
simple
fact
of
the
matter
is,
and
during
the
course
of
three
pleadings,
there
isn't
any
question
--
i
think
the
court
will
agree
that
walker
process
equipment
company
is
submitting
to
the
court
the
sole
and
simple
question
of
whether
the
fraudulent
procurement
in
maintenance
of
a
patent
is
illegal
per
se.
that
is
the
only
question
that
they
are
attempting
to
submit
to
this
court.
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
their
pleadings,
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
confession
of
the
parties.
and
the
reason
they
arrived
at
that
question
and
what
their
position
is
based
in,
is
the
simple
equation
that
any
patent
necessarily
grants
a
monopoly
or
monopolies
are
illegal
under
the
sherman
antitrust
act
and
if
you
remove
the
protection
of
the
patent
laws
from
the
patent,
or
go
ipso
facto
mechanically,
universally,
you
are
left
with
an
unlawful
monopoly.
that
is
all
they
have
ever
attempted
to
say
in
this
case,
if
the
court
please.
their
original
pleading
was
filed
in
response
to
plaintiff
suit
for
infringement.
they
defend
it
on
the
ground
--
so
they
said
that
the
patent
was
obtained
from
the
patent
office
by
misrepresentations
and
that
this
constitutes
unclean
hands.
and
they
added,
this
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
in
their
first
pleading
then,
that's
all
they
said
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
in
their
view,
there
was
a
universal
exchangeability
and
interchange
of
conversion
between
the
defense
of
unenforceability
based
on
so-called
fraudulent
procurement
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
that's
the
most
--
that's
all
that
they
claim.
now
subsequently,
they've
got
leads
to
amend
because
with
nothing
more
than
their
pleading,
i
don't
think
they
would
want
to
proceed
very
far
in
the
case.
with
their
amended
counterclaim,
they
entered
a
new
dimension
to
the
case.
they
contended
that
there
was
some
kind
of
illegal
tie-ins
involved
in
the
case.
then
fmc,
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
its
swing
diffuser
units
were
somehow
packaging
or
forcing
other
equipment
for
plaintiff's
buyers.
they
did
not
however
in
their
amended
complaint
change
their
views
or
plead
anything
different
in
connection
with
this
equation
between
fraudulent
procurement
of
the
patent
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
once
again,
in
their
amended
complaint,
they
simply
said
after
reciting
the
alleged
fraudulent
procurement
that
this
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
they
also
told
us
that
their
point
that
it
constituted
a
claim
for
unjust
enrichment,
it
constituted
some
claim
--
a
claim
for
unfair
competition,
and
they
spelled
out
in
frolics
detail,
if
the
court
please,
an
unintelligible
detail
what
they
were
trying
to
accomplish.
we
moved
in
the
district
court
to
strike
their
complaint
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
not
clear,
it
was
not
readable
under
rule
8,
and
also
for
its
failure
to
state
a
claim
in
which
relief
could
be
granted.
now
contrary,
if
the
court
please,
to
what
mr.
merriam
has
said
this
morning,
mr.
merriam
did
not
participate
in
the
case
at
that
stage.
from
the
very
beginning
in
our
first
brief
in
the
district
court,
we
took
two
positions.
we
took
substantially
the
technical
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on,
and
i'll
advert
further
to
that
later,
but
we
also
took
the
position,
a
great
link
as
i'm
saying
to
the
court
right
now
that
they
are
trying
to
plead
an
automatic
equation
between
fraudulent
procurement
of
a
patent
and
sherman
act
monopolization.
so,
the
original
motion
to
strike
in
our
original
brief,
we
at
length
pointed
out
from
the
very
beginning
that
these
people
were
not
pleading
a
claim
of
monopolization
under
section
2,
that
the
concept
of
monopolization
under
section
2
includes
a
relevant
market,
it's
not
a
question
that
to
some
cases
we
need
a
relevant
market,
in
some
cases
we
don't,
in
any
monopolization
case
under
section
2,
the
very
idea
of
monopolization
means
irrelevant
market.
the
power
to
exclude
competition
or
the
fix
prices
in
a
relevant
market
is
a
criteria
or
at
least
a
basic
mode
of
examination
into
the
ascertainment
of
whether
there
is
monopolization.
in
that
of
any
counterclaim,
despite
all
of
these
allegations
about
antitrust
violations,
there
was
no
suggestion
whether
they
were
pleading
of
monopolization
case,
whether
they
were
pleading
of
section
1
case
out
the
sherman
act
or
whether
they
were
pleading
a
tie-in
case
under
section
3
of
the
clayton
act
or
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
all
they
talked
about
was
antitrust
laws.
and
it
was
for
that
reason
--
and
besides
antitrust
laws,
of
course,
they
were
talking
about
some
kind
of
additional
or
common
law
relief
for
unjust
enrichment.
it
was
for
that
reason
that
we
adopted
the
two-fold
approach
if
that
(inaudible)
for
the
case.
the
theory,
again,
as
i
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
finally
adopted
in
which
i
would
advert
to,
that
somehow,
what
they
were
trying
to
do
is
collaterally
eject
the
validity
of
the
patent
and
that
that
would
not
like.
and
at
the
same
time,
that
if
they
were
talking
about
a
monopolization
case,
they
were
not
pleading
the
case
of
monopolization.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
and
i
think
it
is
crucial
here
for
purposes
of
the
ultimate
termination
of
this
litigation,
they
haven't
pleaded
a
monopolization
case.
they
don't
intend
to
plead
a
monopolization
case.
they're
pleading
a
per
se
case.
they
have
three
chances
to
make
the
monopolization
case
established
and
under
no
circumstances
is
the
appropriate
for
the
case
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
determination
of
what
might
have
been
monopolized
or
what
the
relevant
market
might
have
been.
that
isn't
their
case.
that
is
not
the
issue
that
they
are
presenting
to
this
court.
they're
presenting
to
the
court
--
it's
quite
apparent
from
the
language
of
question
two
presented
by
walkers,
from
the
language
of
the
question
presented
by
the
government,
that
they
are
only
asking
for
this
per
se
determination.
and
i
want
to
suggest
to
the
court,
as
i
have
this
from
the
very
beginning,
that's
all
they
wanted
to
say.
that's
all
they
are
saying
now.
they're
talking
as
even
as
late
as
their
replied
brief,
that
the
relevant
market
maybe
some
kind
of
formality
that
maybe
could
be
supplied
later.
but
they
are
totally
lacking
in
any
appreciation
of
the
relationship
between
the
relevant
market
as
a
dimension
of
monopolization,
there
cannot
be
any
such
thing
as
monopolization
without
reference
to
a
relevant
market.
now,
if
the
court
please
in
response
to
our
first
pleas
in
the
district
court,
their
response
was
--
and
i'm
quoting
from
their
district
court
brief,
“the
patent
monopoly
is
a
monopoly
without
considering
line
of
commerce
or
the
like”.
that's
where
they
started,
that
the
patent
grants
monopoly.
now,
the
district
court
stretched
the
--
the
amended
complaint,
because
it
simply
was
frolics
and
unreadable.
the
same
thing
we
had
already
suggested
in
our
brief
that
they
must
--
if
they
are
going
to
plea
a
monopolization
case,
plead,
and
establish
relevant
market,
otherwise
they're
not
talking
about
monopolization.
maybe
they
are
talking
about
some
kind
of
unfair
competition
which
however
is
not
available
to
them.
once
again,
in
response
to
our
briefs,
that
supported
our
motion
to
dismiss
their
second
amended
counterclaim
which
is
the
stricken
pleading
that
is
here
before
the
court,
they
take
the
position
then
and
i
insist
that,
if
the
court
please,
they
still
sustain
their
position,
they
take
no
other
position.
they
say
a
patent
is
unquestionably
monopolistic.
although
the
patent
statutes
are
inferential
exemptions,
there
are
limits
to
this
inferential
exemption.
one
who
obtains
a
patent
which
he
has
no
basis
whatever
than
a
fraudulent
basis
or
who
maintains
it
in
spite
of
having
only
a
false
basis,
is
beyond
those
limits.
and
therefore,
let
it
expose
to
the
antitrust
laws,
and
as
accordingly
adjoin
a
monopoly
in
violation
of
them,
and
is
liable
to
those
damage.
then,
as
their
case,
if
the
court
please,
they
are
not
pleading
a
case
of
monopolization
from
a
sense
of
monopolization
under
sherman
act
section
2.
they
don't
want
to,
they
don't
intend
to,
they
did
not
tendered
such
a
case
to
the
court
and
they
have
had
now
three
opportunities
with
two
briefs
below,
indicating
to
them
that
if
that's
what
they
wanted
to
plead,
that's
the
way
they
should
do
it.
it
should
not
be
opened
to
them,
it
should
--
it
be
opened
to
the
government
to
suggest
that
in
the
event,
the
claim
that
they
pleaded
could
be
extended
into
a
claim
under
sherman
act
section
2,
that
they
can
go
back
into
the
district
court
to
start
out,
to
examine
it
to
the
relevant
market.
i'll
continue,
if
the
court
please,
tomorrow
on
that
point.
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
time
available
yesterday
i
undertook
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
the
only
claim
walker
really
asserts
is
the
claim
of
monopolization
per
se
so
to
say.
in
walker's
view,
recourse
to
the
relevant
market
is
unnecessary
to
establish
--
excuse
me,
to
establish
monopolization.
moreover,
even
if
at
this
late
date
they
should
take
the
position
that
it
is
open
to
them
to
now
establish
a
relevant
market
in
support
of
a
definition
of
monopolization.
our
position
is,
as
i
indicated
yesterday,
that
after
three
counterclaims
it
would
come
too
late.
i
would
like,
as
a
point
of
departure
this
morning,
to
review
very
briefly
the
stricken
pleading
so
that
we
will
have
it
in
front
of
us
and
so
that
it
will
be
clear
to
everyone
if
the
court
please
that
they
claim
nothing
other
than
monopolization
because
there
--
our
points
in
our
brief
which
suggests
some
kind
of
analogy
to
illegal
tying
arrangements
which
are
proscribed
of
course
by
section
3
of
the
clayton
act
or
by
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
there
is
nothing
to
support
any
such
claim
in
their
pleading.
now,
if
the
court
please,
the
stricken
pleading
appears
on
page
60
of
the
record.
they
state
in
paragraph
15
that
plaintiff
including
its
predecessor
illegally
monopolized
interstate
and
foreign
commerce,
that
is
their
initial
point
of
departure.
they
then
say
that
the
plaintiff
used
its
patent
to
restrict
and
impede
competition
in
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
in
the
sale
of
equipment
not
covered
by
the
patent
in
suit
thereby
monopolizing
trade
in
the
said
commerce.
i
might
say
parenthetically
that
to
the
extent
of
that
paragraph
which
is
paragraph
20
of
the
complaint
appearing
at
page
62
of
the
record,
may
purport
to
set
forth
some
kind
of
claim
of
illegal
tie-ins.
they
have
abandoned
any
such
claim.
that
is
not
before
the
court.
there
is
no
question
presented
to
the
court
of
illegal
tie-ins.
i
quoted
that
paragraph
only
to
indicate
that
the
--
the
final
bottom
line
of
it
is
that
the
assertion
is
fmc
is
monopolizing.
finally,
in
paragraph
2,
they
talk
about
plaintiff's
unlawful
monopoly.
and
the
proper
relief,
if
the
court
please,
is
that
this
constitutes
a
fraud,
that
is
the
unclean
hands
that
they're
asserting,
that
this
constitutes
a
fraud
in
the
patent
office
and
on
this
court,
a
violation
of
antitrust
laws
and
unjust
enrichment
of
plaintiff.
finally,
in
their
brief
at
page
2
they
say
and
i
quote,
“a
lawful
patent
monopoly
is
a
recognized
exception
to
the
monopolies
prohibited
by
section
2
of
the
sherman
act”.
i
suggest,
if
the
court
please,
as
mr.
justice
fortas
proceeded
yesterday,
that
the
walker
argument
proves
much
too
much.
the
argument
is
based
on
the
proposition
that
a
patent
affords
a
monopoly
and
that
upon
removal
of
the
protection
of
the
patent
was
we
are
left
with
an
illegal
monopoly
within
the
scope
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act,
then
i
suggest
would
mean
that
any
patent
invalid
for
any
reason
whether
it's
by
reason
or
fraudulent
procurement
or
whether
its
by
reasonable
act
of
invention,
or
by
reason
of
any
other
defect
would
have
exactly
the
same
consequence
that
walker
suggest
in
this
case.
so
the
entire
premise
that
the
fraudulent
procurement
of
patent
amounts
without
more,
prima
facie
or
per
se
to
monopolization
under
section
2
really
attempts
to
prove
much
more
than
they
begin
to
find
necessary
to
prove.
and
because
it
proves
much
more
than
as
necessary
it
shows
i
think
the
essential
insufficiency
of
the
concept.
now,
the
government
however
comes
to
their
aid
in
a
sense
by
producing
a
more
discriminating
argument.
the
government
really
directly
defines
the
offensive
monopolization.
at
the
government's
brief
at
page
12,
they
say
that
the
offensive
monopolization
under
section
2
is
established
by
proof,
one
that
the
defendant
possess
the
power
to
exclude
competitors
from
the
relevant
market
and
that
the
powers
deliberately
obtained
or
maintained.
however,
the
government
rather
than
showing
out
its
definition
and
applying
it
to
the
situation
and
asking
where
is
the
relevant
market
with
respect
to
the
patent
which
is
suppose
to
constitute
illegal
monopolization
under
section
2,
takes
the
position
for
purposes
of
this
case
or
i
take
it
for
purposes
of
any
attack
on
the
patent
based
on
fraudulent
procurement
that
the
very
scope
of
the
patent's
claims
somehow
presumes
market
control.
so
the
government
by
that
kind
of
prestidigitation,
by
that
kind
of
presumption
with
one
fell
swoop
as
it
were
eliminates
the
necessity
of
looking
to
the
relevant
market.
whereas
the
court
has
in
case
after
case
after
case,
in
the
various
government
agencies
in
case
after
case
have
carefully
examined
in
monopolization
cases
a
question
of
what
constitutes
the
relevant
market
because
the
talk
of
monopolization
or
a
controllable
market
without
talking
about
the
prescribed
market
is
really
to
talk
about
one
side
of
a
point
without
the
other.
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
oh
yes,
your
honor.
if
--
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
there
are
certain
--
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
no,
there
are
not
your
honor.
there
are
no
cases
where
the
claim
is
that
the
fraudulent
procurement
of
a
patent
is
such.
the
only
attempted
enforcement
leaves
you
with
the
violation
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
as
illegal
monopolization
per
se.
there
is
no
case
of
that
kind.
now,
there
are
cases
if
the
court
please
which
is
--
are
to
be
expected,
where
some
kind
of
fraudulent
procurement
of
a
patent
has
been
involved
in
a
whole
scheme
or
conspiracy
or
an
attempted
monopoly
under
section
1
and
section
2
where
like
anything
else,
the
fraudulent
procurement
of
the
patent
comprises
part
of
an
overall
plan
to
monopolize
or
part
of
an
overall
restraint
of
trade
under
section
1.
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
well,
the
gypsum
case,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
no,
i
would
say
the
gypsum
case
--
although
the
court
acknowledged
and
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
reed
who
wrote
the
opinion
that
the
decision
at
that
point
was
not
necessary
for
a
decision
of
the
case.
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
yes,
i
would
say
that.
and
likewise
of
course
it's
a
suit
by
the
government.
it
isn't
a
private
suit
where
an
individual
is
alleging
injury.
however
there
is
nothing
in
their
case
your
honor
which
would
suggest
that
the
procurement
of
the
patent
by
fraudulent
means
would
ergo
without
more
or
constitute
illegal
monopolization
under
section
2.
there
we
have
a
scheme
of
concert,
a
plan
of
action.
now,
the
government
yesterday
made
no
real
efforts
to
support
the
proposition
that
a
patent
somehow
is
prima
facie
support
for
or
evidence
of
market
control.
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
and
i
think
there
is
no
question
about
it
that
the
case
which
they
rely
on,
the
standard
stations
case
and
the
subsequent
cases
where
the
court
has
in
passing
talked
about
a
patent
evidencing
market
control
are
strictly
cases
of
tie-in
agreements.
these
are
cases
either
under
section
3
of
the
clayton
act
or
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
question
in
those
cases
with
respect
to
the
patent
is
simply
how
much
leverage
is
available
to
the
patent
holder
as
a
means
to
accomplish
his
illegal
tie-in.
for
example,
the
inquiry
really
under
section
3
and
that
was
the
inquiry,
in
the
standard
stations
case
where
the
court
was
comparing
the
perniciousness
of
requirements
contracts
to
tying
agreements.
the
inquiry
really
is
whether
there
is
sufficient
dominance
over
the
tie-in
product
to
have
the
leverage
to
be
able
to
force
the
sale
of
the
other
products.
now
in
that
context,
in
the
context
of
a
tying
arrangement
where
the
question
is
really
whether
in
fact
there
is
actual
power
to
accomplish
a
tying
arrangement
whether
there's
actual
power
to
force
the
customer
to
take
something
besides
the
tying
product.
it
--
for
illustrative
purposes
was
said
in
the
standard
stations
case
and
subsequently
in
times-picayune,
that
yes,
for
that
purpose
a
patent
may
be
prima
facie
evidence
of
market
control.
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
although
for
that
purpose,
a
patent
may
suggest
some
kind
of
market
control
or
dominance,
that
does
not
mean
that
for
purposes
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
that
a
patent
all
by
itself
completely
defines
a
relevant
market
and
constitutes
monopolization
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
if
it
should
turn
out
to
be
an
unlawfully
obtained
patent.
i
would
like
to
quote
in
that
connection
and
to
summarize
that
suggestion
to
the
court
from
times-picayune,
345
u.s.
at
page
611.
there
the
court
said
that
section
2
outlaws
monopolization
of
any
appreciable
part
of
interstate
commerce
and
by
section
1
unreasonable
restraints
are
banned
irrespective
of
the
amount
of
commerce
involved.
but
the
essence
of
illegality
in
tying
agreements
is
the
wielding
of
monopolistic
leverage,
a
seller
exploits
his
dominant
position
in
one
market
to
expand
his
empire
into
the
next.
so
i
suggest
to
the
court
finally
that
for
purposes
of
understanding
the
basic
nature
of
a
tying
agreement
and
the
kind
of
control
that
had
defended
may
have
been
such
a
situation.
yes,
for
that
purpose,
control
to
a
patent
may
suggest
the
capacity,
the
ability
prima
facie
to
force
a
tying
arrangement.
but
again,
i
suggest
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
definition
of
monopolization
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
now,
i
suggest
if
the
court
please
that
that
approach,
that
argument
that
the
government
advances
to
relieve
itself
from
the
necessity
of
making
a
market
investigation
and
to
arrive
at
the
concept
of
per
se
illegality
is
completely
specious
--
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
yes,
the
patent
has
expired.
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
in
1961
--
1960,
your
honor.
i
might
say,
in
response
to
miranda's
question,
the
suit
was
filed
about
six
months
before
this
patent
expired.
it
was
the
only
known
infringement
by
this
defendant.
now,
for
purposes
of
the
counterclaim
your
honor
and
for
purposes
of
the
amendments
to
the
counterclaim,
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
the
amendments
relate
back
to
the
date
of
filing
of
those
counterclaims.
so
for
purposes
of
analysis
of
the
case,
the
counterclaim
speaks
as
of
the
date
it
was
filed
during
which
time
the
patent
was
still
enforce
in
effect.
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
yes
sir.
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
yes
it
is
your
honor.
i
think
by
the
terms
of
paragraph
20,
it
--
on
its
face
it's
not
sufficient
to
state
a
claims
for
illegal
tie-ins.
i
would
like
your
honor
if
you
please
to
read
paragraph
17
of
their
previous
amended
counterclaim.
in
that
paragraph
which
was
the
father
so
to
say
of
paragraph
20.
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
that's
at
page
73,
if
the
court
please.
there,
on
page
73
is
the
effort
in
their
predecessor
counterclaim
to
set
forth
some
kind
of
claim
of
illegal
tie-ins.
by
their
paragraph
a
and
b,
i
think
it
will
be
perfectly
apparent
to
the
court
that
all
they
were
suggesting
was
that
in
connection
with
it's
offer
of
--
a
subject
swing,
refusal
of
units,
fmc
was
off
also
selling
a
considerable
amount
of
other
equipment.
there
was
nothing
in
the
predecessor
paragraph
17
or
those
subparagraphs
to
suggest
that
they
were
tying
or
forcing
and
indeed
they
were
not
your
honor
and
that
is
why
when
they
finally
framed
it,
the
new
paragraph
20,
they
eliminated
the
subparagraphs
a
and
b
because
under
its
face,
they
did
not
a
show
a
tie-in.
they
did
not
brief
this
question
in
the
court
of
appeals
even
though
20
was
still
in
there.
we
took
the
position
then
that
they
had
abandoned
it
and
there
just
--
is
not
any
tying
situation
in
this
case,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
no,
i
think
your
honor.
under
no
circumstances,
it
would
be
open
to
them
to
establish
monopolization.
but
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
they
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
that
is
not
what
they
intend
to
do
that
they
--
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
yes,
thank
you
your
honor,
i
think
it
would.
but
as
i
started
out
yesterday
and
as
i'll
say
again
in
passing
and
as
i
will
finally
conclude,
the
question
they
present
to
this
court,
the
position
they've
always
asserted
is
this
per
se
position.
and
there
was
nothing
else
--
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
believe
counsel
for
walker
said
that.
i
think
the
government
mind
that
suggestion
gratuitously
as
you
press
them
to
ascertain
whether
their
position
was
for
per
se
illegality.
i
do
acknowledge
of
course
in
the
reply
brief
of
walker,
they
do
with
a
wave
of
their
hand
say,
“well,
if
relevant,
walker
has
anything
to
do
with
it,
we
could
always
supply
that.”
i
suggest
in
that
connections
your
honor
that
--
and
i
suppose
it's
only
a
truism,
there
must
be
an
end
to
litigation
at
some
point.
these
people
have
taken
this
position
twice
in
the
district
court,
once
in
the
court
of
appeals.
they
have
successfully
petitioned
this
court
to
get
a
determination
of
the
per
se
question,
that
they
have
insisted
is
what
they're
asking
for.
it
should
not
be
open
to
them
under
any
circumstances
after
the
filing
of
three
counterclaims,
after
putting
everybody
in
the
judicial
processes
to
work
--
to
get
an
adjudication
of
that
to
decide
they
don't
need
an
adjudication
of
that.
they
can
just
go
back
and
set
off
with
a
new
complaint.
they
could
have
done
that
after
we
filed
our
motion
to
strike
their
first
counterclaim
and
to
dismiss
it.
we
said
then
and
there,
this
is
not
--
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
oh
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
correct
if
the
court
please.
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
they
--
that
is
correct.
i
think
on
that
basis,
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
thrown
them
out
but
that
is
--
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
i
think
on
the
same
basis,
the
district
court
were
to
throw
them
out.
but
notwithstanding
that
that
is
not
the
question
that
they
present
at
this
point.
i
would
like
to
say
your
honor
too,
that
when
they
file
their
original
counterclaims,
there
was
no
suggestion
of
what
they
were
really
complaining
about.
they
did
not
refer
to
section
1.
they
didn't
refer
to
section
2.
they
didn't
refer
to
clayton
act
section
3.
they
just
said
this
violates
the
antitrust
laws,
and
in
addition,
as
i've
suggested
to
the
court
--
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
that's
--
that
is
correct
your
honor,
on
the
basis
of
the
way
--
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
yes.
that
is
correct.
on
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
it
could
not
be
made
into
an
antitrust
case.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is
probably
an
inaccurate
position
to
take.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
cryptic.
it's
impossible
in
some
ways
to
determine
when
the
court
is
describing
the
position
of
the
parties
and
when
it's
reaching
this
conclusion.
but
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
was
--
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
well,
that
is
certainly
correct
your
honor.
that
is
certainly
correct.
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
that's
correct
your
honor,
no.
if
the
court
please
--
in
returning
to
your
inquiry
mr.
justice
white,
besides
talking
about
antitrust
violation
they
talked
about
unfair
competition,
they
talked
about
unjust
enrichment.
they
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
did
not
have
the
obligation
to
provide
a
legal
category
on
the
basis
on
which
relief
was
available,
that
they
were
hurt
in
some
way
by
the
so-called
fraudulent
procurement.
they
must
have
some
remedy.
and
the
response
to
the
proposition
that
they
must
have
some
remedy
was
the
proposition
finally
adopted
by
the
court
but
not
expressed
if
the
court
please,
in
a
very
artistic
fashion.
that
there
was
no
automatic
conversion
feature
between
this
defense
of
unclean
hands
or
fraudulent
procurement
and
the
availability
of
any
kind
of
affirmative
relief.
now,
that
had
been
the
law
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
district
courts
had
followed
that.
i
agree
that
the
problem
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
leave
them
if
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
stood
in
a
position
where
under
no
circumstances
they
could
--
they
plead
a
good
and
valid
monopolization
case
under
section
2.
but
i
also
suggest
that
the
most
that's
involved
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
--
on
that
basis
is
a
hypothetical
question.
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
effect
says
and
what
bothers
the
government
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
that
the
gov
--
the
court
of
appeals
suggest
that
fraud
in
the
patent
office
can
never
be
part
of
a
showing
of
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
now
if
all
that
this
court
were
concerned
with
were
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
then
this
court
would
say,
i
suggest,
that
that
is
inaccurate.
that
certainly,
under
appropriate
circumstances,
fraud
on
the
patent
office
could
be
a
violation
of
section
1
or
of
section
2.
but
if
we
are
left
with
only
that
hypothetical
consideration,
that
cannot
dispose
of
the
litigation
and
i
suggest
very
emphatically
that
that
is
not
the
question
as
they
presented
to
this
court.
and
what
attracted
the
government
to
this
case,
i
suggest,
and
the
reason
they
came
in
was
an
opportunity
to
find
a
new
area
of
per
se
illegality.
here
where
you
have
a
patent
allegedly
procured
by
fraud.
you
have
section
2
monopolization
without
more.
the
relevant
market
is
presumed
and
if
the
court
please,
now
the
justice
department
should
go
out
and
get
a
summary
judgment
without
any
market
investigation,
without
any
study
of
the
relevant
factors.
if
it
can
just
establish
that
the
patent
was
procured
by
fraud
and
then
enforced,
i
suggest
that
is
why
the
justice
department
came
into
this
case.
if
there
were
only
the
question
of
the
correctness
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
the
justice
department
would
be
unable
to
take
the
position
it
does
by
its
question
in
this
case.
in
question
two,
which
is
the
question
for
certiorari
presented
by
walker,
would
not
really
be
controlling.
now
the
court,
as
i
understand
it,
in
the
exercise
of
the
certiorari
jurisdiction
is
concerning
itself
with
the
question
presented
by
the
party
and
it
is
their
question
that
they
presented
and
we
are
undertaking
as
best
as
we
can
to
show
the
insufficiency
of
their
solution
to
the
question.
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor
because
they
contend
that
a
component
of
the
cause
of
action
or
the
claim
is
that
fmc
undertook
to
enforce
its
patent
against
them.
so
we
filed
a
patent
infringement
suit
back
in
1960
while
as
of
today
there
would
be
a
problem
because
four
years
have
expired
since
the
last
act
in
connection
with
the
original
cause
of
action.
but
at
that
time
they
filed
their
counterclaim,
there
was
no
statutory
limitations
defense
available
to
us.
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
as
of
today,
i
believe
they
would
be
barred,
if
the
court
please.
yesterday
in
response
to
questions
from
the
bench
and
so
to
say
the
relevance
of
the
relevant
market
to
the
concept
of
monopoly,
counsel
for
the
government
took
the
position
that,
well,
sometimes
we
need
relevant
market
and
sometimes
we
have
situations
that
are
illegal
per
se
and
we
don't
need
a
relevant
market.
i
would
like
if
i
can
and
if
the
court
please
to
try
to
underscore
the
situations
where
relevant
market
is
necessarily
and
universally
a
requirement
and
i
think
it
takes
a
very
little
analysis
to
get
to
that
point.
when
we're
talking
about
per
se
violations
ordinarily
we
are
in
the
realm
of
section
1.
section
1
of
course
as
for
its
ultimate
criterion
the
question
of
reasonableness,
reasonableness
of
the
restraint
and
the
court
has
held
in
a
handful
of
situations
price
fixing,
through
boycotts
perhaps
unlawful
tie-ins
and
horizontal
divisions
of
market
that
in
those
situations
the
restraint
is
per
se
prima
facie
if
it
were
illegal
because
it
has
no
justification
whatsoever.
it
obviously
and
patently
forecloses
competition
between
competitors.
it's
only
question
under
section
1.
when
we
get
to
section
2
however,
we
are
not
talking
about
foreclosing
the
competition
of
an
individual
competitor
or
suppressing
the
competition
of
an
individual.
we
are
talking
about
either
monopolization,
attempted
monopolization,
or
a
combination
or
conspiracy
to
monopolize.
now
if
the
court
please,
the
act
nowhere
talks
about
a
monopoly
as
mr.
justice
holmes
observed
many
years
ago
in
the
northern
securities
case
having
a
monopoly
is
not
the
same
thing
by
any
means
as
the
offensive
monopolization.
the
monopolization
that
the
court
is
talking
about
which
for
many,
many
seasons
so
to
speak
and
in
many,
many
cases,
it
is
carefully
defined
relevant
market.
the
monopolization
under
section
2
that
it
is
talking
about
relates
to
some
control,
some
capacity
to
exclude
competition
in
some
kind
of
a
relevant
market
coupled
with
either
an
historical
effort
and
intent
to
obtain
that
control
or
other
unlawful
conduct
in
that
connection.
to
eliminate
from
the
concept
of
section
2
monopolization,
the
feature
of
what
is
monopolized
is,
if
the
court
please,
i
think
completely
untenable.
likewise,
when
we
get
into
the
area
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
again
we
are
talking
about
the
relevant
market
because
we
are
talking
about
the
possible
adverse
effect
on
competition
or
tendency
to
create
a
monopoly.
so
when
we
look
at
a
merger
case
as
the
court
did
in
brown
shoe
and
seven
rate
merger
cases
since
then,
or
when
we
look
at
a
monopolization
case
under
section
1,
we
are
looking
to
the
market
effects.
we
are
looking
to
the
broad
scope
of
the
probability
that
competition
will
or
will
not
be
affected
in
some
specified
and
relevant
area.
that
however
is
not
the
case
under
section
1
where
we're
just
looking
for
suppression
of
competition
as
to
an
individual
competitor.
and
generally
speaking,
it
is
not
the
case
as
to
section
3
of
the
clayton
act
where
we
were
likewise
looking
to
the
position
of
an
individual
upon
whom
products
have
been
forced
by
reason
of
the
control
of
the
seller
over
some
kind
of
a
tie-in
product.
so,
it
is
not
a
question
that
the
court
may
sometimes
say,
“well,
we
have
to
look
to
the
relevant
market
in
some
other
times.”
say,
“well,
we
won't
look
to
the
relevant
market,”
it's
purely
and
simply,
if
the
court
please,
a
question
of
understanding
the
operation
of
the
various
provisions
of
the
sherman
act
and
of
the
clayton
act.
and
once
again,
i
underscore
and
reemphasize
that
as
far
as
monopolization
under
section
2
is
concerned,
the
result
of
what
i
say
is
that
without
a
relevant
market,
there
can't
be
any
monopolization.
i
suggest
too,
as
a
matter
of
policy
if
the
court
please,
that
we
have
in
our
society
very
few
absolutes.
we
have,
as
i
have
indicated,
very
few
categories
of
per
se
liability.
in
the
complexity
and
the
richness
of
our
social
and
economic
fabric,
there
are
always
distinctions.
there
are
always
facts
and
circumstances.
there
are
always
special
situations
that
have
to
be
considered.
every
time
we
establish
some
new
category
of
per
se
liability,
whether
it's
under
the
sherman
act
or
under
any
other
provision
of
law,
we
are
losing
something
of
value
because
in
the
final
analysis,
there
is
no
substitute
for
concrete
investigation
of
the
concrete
facts
and
circumstances
of
a
particular
situation.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
consider,
if
i
may,
the
apparent
inappropriateness
of
this
particular
case
for
the
court
to
undertake
to
make
any
kind
of
pronouncements
that
might
be
construed
by
the
lower
court's
and
the
bar
to
be
(inaudible)
or
far
reaching
or
constitute
the
development
of
a
new
category
of
liability
under
the
antitrust
laws.
counsel
for
walker
yesterday
elaborated
at
length
and
the
alleged
fraud
in
this
case
attempting
to
tar
fmc
corporation
with
the
black
brush
of
bad
conduct.
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
of
course
the
conclusions
of
fraud
for
purposes
of
testing
the
sufficiency
of
the
pleading
are
accepted,
that
is
a
necessary
point
in
order
to
work
off
of
a
motion
to
dismiss.
however,
i
invite
the
court's
rotation
to
the
way
walker
pleaded
the
question
of
fraud
in
its
amended
counterclaims,
the
predecessor
to
the
stricken
pleading.
there
walker
said
the
plaintiff
committed
at
least
a
technical
fraud
on
the
patent
office
by
representing
that
the
patent
that
not
be
on
sale
or
in
public
use
for
more
than
a
year.
at
that
time,
when
walker
was
so
pleading,
it
did
not
regard
the
fraud
as
some
kind
of
vicious
and
horrendous
and
indefensible
situation.
in
addition,
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
and
this
is
apparent
from
the
record,
the
plaint
--
the
original
complaint
shows
that
the
patent
is
the
lannert
patent.
and
fmc
corporation
is
a
subsequent
assignee
of
that
patent.
lannert
was
an
employee
of
chicago
pump
company.
the
patent
was
applied
for
in
1942.
in
1954,
fmc
corporation
acquired
all
the
assets
of
chicago
pump
company.
now,
i
think
most
likely
from
the
standpoint
of
the
rights
of
creditors
and
others,
fmc
company
is
of
course
liable
for
the
acts
of
its
predecessor
although
we
have
that
situation
from
the
standpoint
of
attributing
to
fmc
corporation
most
of
the
elements
necessary
to
create
the
offense
of
monopolization
namely,
the
monopoly
power
coupled
with
the
monopolistic
intent
which
is
supposed
to
be
evidenced
by
the
fraudulent
procurement
of
the
patent.
from
that
standpoint,
the
case
presents
a
peculiar
wrinkle
because
it
was
a
remote
individual
predecessor
of
fmc
who
applied
for
the
patent
and
it
was
that
individual
if
there
was
a
fraud
committed
on
the
patent
office
who
was
guilty
of
that
fraud.
now,
to
take
in
a
case
where
the
facts
have
not
been
tried,
where
the
facts
are
merely
speculative
and
based
on
the
allegations
of
the
pleader
and
couple
that
remote
intention
with
the
subsequent
activity
of
fmc
corporation
in
enforcing
the
patent
and
say
that
those
two
fit
together
to
subject
fmc
corporation
to
the
offensive
monopolization,
that
presents
a
problem
which
i
think
properly,
if
that
were
the
question
in
the
case,
would
have
to
be
tried,
the
defenses
would
have
to
be
tried
out
and
the
facts
would
have
to
be
ascertained.
those
difficulties
plus
the
very
difficulty
of
the
nature
of
their
pleading
and
the
ultimate
confusion
that
they
expressed
in
their
briefs
and
in
their
proper
relief
suggesting
really
that
what
their
complaining
about
is
analogous
to
a
tying
situation
which
of
course
it
really
is
not
because
this
is
not
a
leverage
situation.
fmc
has
not
used
the
patent
to
force
anyone,
let
alone
walker,
to
acquire
something
in
addition
to
the
patent
and
product.
there
is
no
tie-in.
there
is
no
forcing
of
any
kind.
so
that
the
analogy
really,
if
the
court
please,
simply
has
no
bearing
on
the
situation,
couple
that
with
the
factor
that
when
they
say
in
their
suggestion
of
damages
that
they
were
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
compete
with
walker
--
excuse
me,
with
fmc.
what
they're
saying
by
that
really
is
that
if
it
were
a
sherman
act
section
1
case,
they
had
been
injured,
their
competition
were
suppressed.
and
accordingly
because
it
looks
like
a
sherman
section
1
from
that
standpoint,
they
ought
to
have
some
kind
of
cause
of
action
under
the
antitrust
laws
which
of
course
they
cannot
allege
because
there's
no
element
of
combination
or
conspiracy
or
contract
which
is
requisite
to
section
1.
and
the
finding
in
their
previous
pleadings
and
in
their
briefs,
an
effort
is
set
forth
some
kind
of
common
law
fraud
claim,
some
kind
of
claim
of
unfair
competition.
it
was
seen
really
that
if
an
action
to
a
private
party
were
available
under
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
that
that
is
really
what
their
complaining
about.
some
kind
of
unfair
method
of
competition
that
walker
--
excuse
me,
that
fmc
had
this
patent
an
item
that
they
were
unable
to
successfully
compete
with
it.
and
that
fmc
had
fraudulently
procured
it
that
might
be
some
method
of
unfair
competition
interdicted
by
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
we
have
all
of
these
difficulties
in
this
case.
it
does
not
seem
to
lend
itself
to
a
definitive
pronouncement
by
the
court
in
this
state
of
the
facts.
nonetheless,
i
would
like
to
make
this
perfectly
clear
once
again
if
i
may.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
this
case
should
go
back
to
the
district
court
with
an
opportunity
for
them
to
amend
this
thing
once
more
and
to
figure
out
if
there
is
in
some
way
now
after
having
presented
this
per
se
question
to
this
court,
isn't
there
some
way
now
that
they
can
go
ahead
and
state
their
claims
for
relief
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
i
am
not
suggesting
that,
if
the
court
please.
i'm
suggesting
only
in
the
first
instance
that
on
the
question
presented,
they
have
not
stated
a
claim
for
relief.
their
legal
theory
leaves
them
up
against
the
blind
wall
because
they
cannot
simply
equate
the
fraudulent
procurement
of
the
patent
or
a
patent
monopoly
with
sherman
act
monopolization.
and
secondly,
that
they
have
had
their
day
in
court.
if
every
time
a
party
were
to
lose
on
the
basis
of
illegal
theory,
that
it's
made
three
efforts
to
carry
through
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
and
then
up
to
the
supreme
court,
if
every
time
they
could
do
that
and
start
out
all
over
again,
we
would
never
finish
with
the
processes
of
litigation.
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
complaint
was
filed
in
1960,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
there
was
an
original
counterclaim,
which
was
twice
amended,
so
they
made
three
efforts
to
plead
this
counterclaim.
i
suggest
that
the
question
of
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
not
to
grant
a
fourth
opportunity
to
amend
is
really
not
something
with
respect
to
which
this
court
on
certiorari
would
be
particularly
concerned
with.
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
no,
no,
there
was
not
your
honor.
it
was
dismissed
with
prejudice
so
that
they
would
have
an
opportunity
to
appeal
or
i
think
if
they
wanted
to
they
could
have
wanted
and
asked
for
leave
to
amend
whether
it
was
dismissed
with
prejudice
or
not.
i
think
that's
just
surplus
verbiage
when
a
counterclaim
is
dismissed.
it's
always
open
to
a
pleader
to
ask
the
court
for
a
leave
to
amend
its
pleading.
the
court
obviously
would
have
denied
it
because
the
court
had
had
several
opportunities
to
review
walker's
theory.
mr.
sheldon
o.
collen
no,
there
was
not
your
honor
because
as
mr.
justice
white
has
observed
the
nature
of
the
court
of
appeal's
opinion
was
such
that
it
foreclosed
the
possibility
of
relief
under
early
circumstances.
i
think
if
the
court
please
whatever
remains
of
the
position
that
we
want
to
take
that
i
have
not
touched
on
is
adequately
touched
upon
in
our
briefs
and
that
bring
the
case
i
shall
conclude.
