because
there
is
a
difference
for
what
it's
worth,
the
--
in
gypsum,
the
united
states
once
was
the
party
and
that

justice
potter
stewart
and
that
would

justice

yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
per
se
inherently
--
inevitably
in
every
case?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
you
first,
by
definition
i
--
as
it
shown,
the
exercise
of
the
monopoly
power
within
the
meaning
of
that
--
of
that
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
i
wonder
if
i
could
ask
mr.
friedman
a
question
mr.
collen.
justice
potter
stewart
because
--
perhaps
i
misunderstood
it,
but
if
as
i
understood
it,
it
seemed
to
me
there
was
some
disparity
between
your
brief
and
your
oral
argument
and
i'd
like
to
be
straightened
out.
as
i
read
that
part
b
of
your
brief,
it's
the
government's
position
that
the
use
of
a
patent
fraudulently
procured
regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
patent,
and
without
more,
constitutes
a
monopoly
under
the
antitrust
laws.
that's
what
b
seems
to
say
to
me
and
is
that
--
do
i
understand
that
position
correctly?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
therefore
exactly
equate
the
meaning
of
the
word
“monopoly”
as
we
know
it
in
the
patent
law
even
though
it's
a
little
gadget
with
the
meaning
of
the
word
monopoly
under
the
sherman
act?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
exactly
equate
the
two?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
that
to
say
mr.
friedman,
that
all
distinction
between
a
so-called
legal
fraud
and
equitable
fraud,
you
limit
this
to
legal
fraud
--
justice

the
actual
