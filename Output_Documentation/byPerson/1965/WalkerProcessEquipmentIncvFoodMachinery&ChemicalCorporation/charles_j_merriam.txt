mr.
charles
j.
merriam
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit
for
affirming
an
opinion
of
the
district
court
on
two
different
aspects.
the
first
was
the
dismissal
of
the
original
complaint
for
patent
infringement
on
the
latter
patent
which
i
will
go
into,
after
it
had
become
apparent
that
the
patent
had
been
obtained
by
fraud
upon
the
patent
office
and
without
an
opportunity
to
obtain
findings
of
facts
with
respect
to
that
fraud,
and
also,
without
awarding
as
requested
attorney's
fees
in
connection
with
the
dismissal.
the
second
point
of
time,
perhaps
more
important
here
was
the
dismissal
of
walkers'
counterclaim
--
or
rather
second
amended
counterclaim
which
setup
a
cause
of
action,
allegedly,
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
fmc
had
obtained
its
patent
by
a
fraud
from
the
patent
office
and
failing
to
point
out
to
the
patent
office,
and
in
filing
a
false
oath
with
respect
to
the
absence
of
prior
use
more
than
a
year
before
the
patent
was
filed.
that
was
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
a
plaintiff
in
a
declaratory
judgment
action
which
was
--
the
counterclaim
was
taken
to
be
cannot
raise
the
issue
of
fraud
because
that
would
in
effect
be
invalidating
the
patent
which
it
could
only
be
done
by
the
patent
office,
it
distinguished
from
cases
where
a
fraud
was
setup
in
defense.
the
latter
patent
relates
to
the
treatment
of
sewage
and
it
is
in
the
class
of
what
you
call
aerations
equipment
and
where
long
pipes,
perforated
pipes
or
tube
are
put
into
the
bottom
of
the
incoming
sewage
vessels
and
a
stream
of
air
is
passed
through
that
sewage.
these
pipes,
if
left
by
themselves
in
the
old
days,
clog
and
the
only
remedy
was
to
drain
the
tanks
and
go
down
and
clean
off
the
pipes,
which
was
not
exactly
an
appealing
job.
and
eventually,
the
chicago
pump
company
which
is
a
division
of
fmc,
developed
a
so-called
swing
diffuser
in
which
the
pipes
were
mounted
on
a
swing
apparatus
which
would
swing
them
up
so
they
could
be
cleaned
out
of
the
tank.
that
involves
some
difficulties
because
of
the
long
arm
of
the
--
it
was
necessary
to
swing
them
out
and
it
involve
a
considerable
torque
and
--
so
the
present
invention
came
along,
a
so-called
invention,
in
which
the
--
instead
of
a
rigid
arm,
they
need
action
or
hinged
arm
to
put
in
so
that
the
torque
was
left,
you
could
left
this
that's
almost
straight
up.
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
only
improvement
was
in
the
lifter
arm,
the
patent
covers
the
entire
assembly
including
the
tanks
of
which
the
end
diffuser
pipes,
which
the
villagers
and
municipalities
themselves
ordinarily
installed.
this
--
the
result
of
the
patent
however,
was
to
permit
the
chicago
pump
company
and
later
fmc,
which
took
it
over,
to
have
a
complete
monopoly
on
swing
diffusers
and
a
substantially
complete
monopoly
on
diffuser
equipment
itself.
the
--
mr.
forest
who
represented
fmc
himself
admitted
at
page
50
that
they
had
had
practically
no
competition
in
the
diffuser
field.
and
at
55,
which
is
a
motion
filed
for
dismissal
by
fmc,
they
confessed
that
they
had
only
been
able
to
find
one
single
instance
of
infringement
up
to
a
time
or
after
the
patent
had
expired.
what
happened
commercially
was
that
the
walker
people
got
into
this
business
much
later
than
fmc.
by
1954,
they
had
developed
what
they
called
sparger
and
this
appears
at
page
74
of
the
record,
which
used
a
--
what
they
believed
to
be
a
non-clogging
type
of
diffuser.
so
that
it
did
not
have
to
be
cleaned
and
therefore
it
did
not
have
to
be
lifted
out.
but
they
were
not
able
to
convince
the
municipalities
of
this
and
after
all,
there
are
some
reasons
for
that
because
you
have
to
convince
somebody
that
five
years
from
now,
he's
not
going
to
have
to
clean
something
that
he
wants
to
be
convinced
about.
and
the
--
at
any
rate,
walker
was
unable
to
make
much
of
the
penetration
into
the
field
because
of
the
lifting
--
this
--
the
action
lifter.
however,
about
1956,
the
walker
people,
who
remains
not
described
in
the
record
and
i
don't
know
what
it
was,
got
a
wind
of
the
fact
that
there
might
have
been
a
prior
public
use.
and
the
patent
was
applied
for
on
february
2nd,
1942
and
they've
got
wind
of
an
earlier
device
more
than
a
year
before,
sold
by
the
plaintiff
but
no
actual
information.
but
they
wrote
frankly,
a
letter
to
fmc
which
appears
in
page
16
of
the
record,
pointing
out
that
they
had
heard
this
and
asking
them
to
investigate.
fmc
replied,
the
reply
is
not
in
the
record
but
at
page
62
in
the
pleadings,
it
appears
that
they
simply
denied
any
responsibility
in
looking
into
the
matter
and
they
didn't.
however,
walker
got
some
courage
up
and
sold
an
infringing
device
to
the
city
of
houston,
in
19
--
in
or
about
1960.
and
in
june
of
1960,
the
suit
from
which
this
arises
was
brought
against
walker
and
chicago
alleging
infringement.
now,
that
was
only
two
and
a
half
months
before
the
patent
expired.
the
process
of
discovering
followed,
and
it
was
not
until
the
winter
of
1962,
that
we
obtained
from
the
plaintiff,
the
documents
which
are
in
the
record
at
page
21
to
27
which
showed
that
prior
to
february
2nd,
1941,
there
was
an
operation
at
the
hunter
airbase
in
savannah,
georgia
an
aeration
system
involving
these
lifter
arms.
that
came
hard
and
i'm
not
going
to
go
into
great
details
of
what
happened
but
there
was
a
great
deal
of
evasive
answering
of
interrogatories
until
these
documents
came
out.
and
even
then,
it
was
maintained
by
fmc
that
was
not
a
prior
use
because
the
claims
of
most
of
them
call
for
these
presence
of
some
means
of
pulling
out
the
diffuser
tube,
because
they
had
supplied
the
crane,
although
at
page
40
of
the
record,
they
admitted
that
the
cranes
were
there
and
ready
for
use
and
at
page
62
in
the
amended
complaint,
it
was
alleged
that
the
--
they
were
there
and
that
was
admitted
by
the
motion
to
strike.
now,
that
was
followed
in
september
of
1962
by
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
part
of
defendant,
alleging
that
there
was
a
prior
public
use,
and
asking
that
the
complaint
be
dismissed
for
that.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
--
well,
on
october
5th
of
that
year,
a
month
later,
the
plaintiff
filed
an
affidavit
purporting
to
answer
the
question
of
prior
public
use
and
as
a
result
on
october
18th,
these
dates
have
some
importance
to
the
sequence
and
that's
why
i'm
going
into
them.
the
depositions
were
taken
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
deposition,
the
plaintiff
announced
that
they
were
going
to
move
to
dismiss
their
complaint
with
prejudice
and
would
we
want
to
take
the
depositions
anyway.
well
the
depositions
were
taken,
they
confirmed
what
i
have
said
to
the
court,
and
the
--
then
the
plaintiff
did
moved
to
dismiss
and
that
motion
was
granted
in
february
of
1963,
at
which
time
our
motion
for
attorney's
fees
was
denied
and
our
motion
to
file
in
the
amended
counterclaim
was
granted
which
was
done,
that
counterclaim
appears
at
page
71
of
the
record.
later
in
june,
a
second
amended
counterclaim
was
filed
and
it
was
--
it
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
that
motion
was
granted
in
october.
now,
so
far
as
the
law
on
the
antitrust
aspects
of
this
case
are
concerned,
i'm
going
to
touch
fairly
lightly
because
i
think
mr.
friedman
will
cover
it
in
more
detail
and
i
don't
want
to
trespass
or
overlap.
but
i
will
say
this
much,
the
--
it's
very
strange
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
against
us
on
the
basis
of
several
cases,
none
of
which
is
cited
in
this
court
by
our
opponents
which
is
relied
upon.
the
thrust
of
the
argument
of
respondents
is
that
no
relief
can
be
had
here.
because
of
now
for
the
first
time,
the
question
of
relevant
market
is
raised,
which
was
not
raised
on
motion,
it
was
not
raised
as
a
special
pleading
and
it
is
raised
here
for
the
first
time.
the
basis
of
our
understanding
of
the
counterclaim
is
that
this
court
in
the
hazel
atlas
-
hartford-empire
case,
on
the
basis
of
a
fraud
far
less
serious
than
the
one
here
because
it
involved
only
an
article
which
was
in
fact
true,
although
represented
to
have
been
written
on
a
different
way
than
it
was
written.
not
only
held
that
patent
invalid,
but
permitted
a
reopening
of
cases
which
had
been
decided
years
before.
and
in
the
shawkee
case,
which
is
also
in
our
brief,
directed
that
recovery
should
be
had
on
account
of
this
improper
use
of
the
patent,
which
recovery
was
in
the
hartford
against
shawkee
case
in
163
f.2d
actually
granted,
including
attorney's
fees.
in
that
case,
lost
business
was
not
covered
because
they
said
that
the
proof
on
it
was
too
conjectory.
now,
what
our
opponents
really
come
down
to
in
this
case
is,
that
they
assert
that
we
are
seeking
to
have
the
patent
--
at
least,
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
on
their
request,
that
we
are
seeking
to
have
a
patent
thrown
out
to
an
adjudication
in
rem
rather
in
persona
which
is
the
ordinary
remedy
on
a
patent
infringement
suit.
actually,
nothing
of
the
kind
was
involved
here,
the
patent
expired
several
years
before
the
judge
dismissed
our
counterclaim.
and
why
--
anybody
should
think
that
it
was
necessary
to
throw
out
or
have
declared
invalid
the
patent
which
had
already
expired,
we
don't
know
and
they
have
not
explained.
the
--
what
did
they
effectively
ask
is
that
if
this
case
had
gone
along,
they
concede
that
if
we
had
gone
along
as
in
the
hazel-atlas
case
and
the
patent
had
been
found
invalid
as
we
had
a
right
to
defend
against
it
in
the
complaint.
but
then,
all
of
these
remedy
would
have
followed.
but
since
they
were
permitted
over
--
in
acquisition
to
our
counterclaim
to
dismiss
their
complaint
that
there
should
be
a
different
rule
of
law,
either
no
reason
is
given
for
such
a
different
rule
of
law,
we
don't
see
any.
all
we
ask
is
that
here
is
somebody
who
has
taken
a
patent
which
was
improperly
obtained
from
the
government
and
that
is
admitted
of
course
in
the
motion
to
strike
and
used
it
to
the
detriment
of
our
client.
and
the
detriment
of
the
client
had
clearly
shown
in
the
pleadings,
four
lost
jobs
are
shown
and
a
possible
fifth,
involving
enormous
amount
of
that
--
up
in
that
--
scores
a
thousand
of
dollars,
there's
also
a
showing
that
other
business
was
probably
lost
because
of
the
denial
of
the
right
to
make
the
action
lifters,
all
of
which
is
a
definite
damage
and
all
of
which
accrued
solely
because
plaintiff
had
in
its
possession
a
patent
which
if
the
facts
had
been
told
to
the
patent
office,
if
there
had
not
been
a
false
oath
that
was
filed,
namely
that
there
had
been
no
prior
public
use,
we
would
not
have
been
faced
to
it
and
we
would
have
been
able
to
compete.
there's
actually
allegations
on
the
--
there
are
actually
allegations
on
the
record
showing
losses
of
up
in
the
--
or
excess
profits
to
the
plaintiff
up
around
$12
million
or
more,
because
of
this
cloning
of
a
patent
which
they
knew
or
should
have
known
because
the
acts
were
there,
was
invalid.
no,
i'm
not
going
to
talk
a
great
length
about
the
matter
of
relevant
market
because
i
think
that
also
comes
in
mr.
friedman's
area,
but
i
will
say
this.
the
respondents
do
not
appear
to
question
the
fact
that
wherever
there
has
been
any
kind
of
a
tying
agreement
involving
a
patent,
that
that
is
per
se
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law.
they
say
this
is
not
a
tying
case
and
i
suppose
in
the
classical
sense,
it
is
not
a
tying
case
because
this
was
a
100%
tie
where
there's
--
everything
here
was
unpatented
but
it
was
tied
to
a
patent
as
if
it
were
patented.
and
why
there
should
be
a
less
severe
rule
in
the
case
where
everything
that
was
sold
was
really
should
have
been
outside
of
the
patent
laws,
then
a
case
where
the
--
only
a
part
of
what
was
sold
was
outside
of
the
patent
laws,
i
don't
know.
i
also
say
although
the
question
is
not
clearly
delaminated
in
the
pleadings
because
while
it
is
the
diversity
is
shown
of
the
two
parties,
it
is
not
shown
where
the
primary
office
of
the
fmc
is,
although
actually
it's
in
california.
i
think
there
would
have
been
a
common
law
diversity
action
here
for
fraud
because
we
were
harmed
by
their
fraud.
however,
i
don't
think
that
question
necessarily
has
to
be
considered
on
diversity
which
has
been
pleaded.
i
think
that
the
counterclaim
certainly
drew
out
in
the
transaction
pleaded
in
the
original
complaint,
mainly
here
was
a
patent.
they
were
sued
on
because
of
the
patent.
we
were
harmed
and
i
think
the
two
transactions
are
relevant
in
that
respect.
so
far
as
the
matter
of
attorney's
fees
is
concerned,
the
law
of
course
is
clear,
the
court
may
and
has
discretion
to
award
attorney's
fees
in
an
extraordinary
case.
i
think
beyond
any
question,
this
is
an
extraordinary
case,
the
fact
that
the
court
did
not
let
it
go
to
a
final
proof
either
on
the
complaint
or
on
the
counterclaim
to
show
that
there
was
actually
fraud,
to
make
findings
of
fact
as
to
fraud.
i
think,
there
should
be
no
excuse
and
rather
should
be
in
our
favor
and
instead
of
the
court.
i
think
you
do
the
discretion,
although
i
think
that
in
view
of
the
shawkee
case,
the
163
f.2d,
the
--
if
there
is
a
reversal
on
the
other
point,
the
rulings
of
this
court
in
hartford-empire
and
in
the
directions
for
shawkee
would
clearly
cover
us
and
permit
the
recovery
of
the
attorney's
fees
as
justified
on
the
final
outcome
of
the
case.
so
when
i
say
that
while
this
is
an
extraordinary
case,
i
don't
know
of
any
other
fraud
of
this
nature
that
was
not
reimbursed
by
attorney's
fees.
this
may
or
may
not
be
moot
depending
on
what
happens
to
the
other
issue.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i'll
start
out
by
answering
mr.
justice
white's
question
as
to
whether
we
do
say
that
if
the
court
decides
this
is
not
a
per
se
violation
we
would
like
to
go
back
and
replay
it
and
we
would.
i
thought
i
said
it
before
but
i'll
say
it
now.
two,
i'd
like
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
alright,
you
mean
in
the
lower
court?
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
no,
i
wasn't
in
the
lower
court
and
i
don't
know
that
anybody
ever
said
it
through
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
don't
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
it's
my
understanding
that
it
was
not.
the
record
doesn't
show
that
it
was,
but
as
mr.
collen
said,
i
wasn't
there
so
i
can
say
no
more
than
that.
i
came
into
this
case
only
after
when
taken
by
this
court.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
wouldn't
like
to.
i'd
like
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i'd
like
to
amend
the
pleading.
it's
not
the
kind
of
a
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
it's
not
the
kind
of
pleading
i
would
have
drawn.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
second,
i
don't
know
of
any
abandonment
of
the
tie-in
clause
and
i
understand
that
there
have
been
tie-ins.
now,
mr.
collen
says
that
was
done.
i've
talked
to
our
people
and
they
say
it
was
not.
it's
not
on
the
record
that
there
was
any
withdrawal.
mr.
collen
said
there
are
no
cases
in
the
lower
courts
passing
on
the
point
which
is
here.
there
are
in
fact
two
of
them
cited
in
our
brief
which
he
never
answered.
they
are
the
clinton
case
and
the
(inaudible)
case
cited
on
pages
9
and
13
of
our
brief.
off
of
which
is
squarely
implied
in
which
they
--
monopolization
count
was
upheld
against
the
motion
to
strike.
in
the
briggs
case,
it
was
specifically
because
there
had
been
an
alleged
fraud
on
the
patent
office
in
connection
with
the
prior
use,
which
is
not
revealed
to
it.
those
two
cases
have
never
been
referred
to
at
all
by
my
opponent
and
they
are
there.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
the
clinton
against
briggs
&
stratton
on
page
9
and
the
(inaudible)
case
which
i
believe
is
on
the
same
page.
they're
also
cited
on
page
13
of
our
brief.
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
about
the
effect
of
the
statute's
limitations.
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
again
to
refer
to
the
hartford-empire
against
shawkee
which
is
recited
in
our
brief
on
the
same
page
9
and
the
subsequent
case
in
the
district
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
where
the
patent
had
been
set
aside
by
fraud
11
years
after
the
event.
and
they
held
that
while
the
statute
of
limitations
was
gone,
i
mean,
had
passed
and
expired,
a
recovery
would
be
allowed
simply
on
the
ground
of
improper
use
of
the
patent.
and
among
those
was
attorneys
fees,
they
refused
to
allow
a
business
recovery
not
on
the
ground
of
statute
of
limitations
but
on
the
ground
that
it
had
not
been
proved
properly.
the
matter
of
relevant
market,
it's
really
--
has
come
up
here
for
the
first
time.
i
think
as
mr.
justice
black
says
doesn't
belong
here
for
discussion
at
all.
as
to
mr.
justice
black's
question,
i
wouldn't
say
however
that
--
i
think
that
we
have
a
tendency,
i'm
primarily
a
patent
lawyer
and
not
an
antitrust
lawyer,
we
have
a
tendency
to
make
secondary
rules
of
construction
of
revenues
and
then
forget
that
they
are
secondary
such
as
change
or
form
doesn't
amount
to
invention.
that's
only
in
its
evidence,
it
isn't,
the
ultimate
fact
is
whether
or
not
there
was
invention,
there
was
unobvious.
so
here,
the
ultimate
fact
is
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
had
--
was
able
to
control
prices
in
the
industry.
if
he
was
able
to
control
prices,
relevant
market
is
not
of
importance
at
all.
it's
only
important
as
it
was
in
the
cellophane
case
to
show
because
controlling
prices
is
not
normally
an
easy
thing
to
do.
you
have
to
take
the
eloquent
evidence
on
it
and
in
that
case,
there
were
plenty
of
other
wrapping
materials
that
indicated
that
there
was
no
ability
to
control
prices
even
though
it
had
a
monopoly,
(inaudible)
of
monopoly.
so
here,
the
--
it
was
left
out
of
our
second
counterclaim,
i
would
have
put
it
in,
in
better
form.
but
on
page
78
of
the
record
the
statement
was
made
in
paragraph
24
that
before
the
patent
expired,
the
prices
were
$150
a
lineal
foot
and
sometimes
higher
possibly
and
that
after
the
patent
expired
there
were
$50
a
running
foot
which
certainly
shows
right
off
there
that
there
was
a
controlled
price.
furthermore,
mr.
forrest,
their
man,
said
on
page
50
that
they
had
to
control
not
only
of
the
action
lifter,
but
they
had
virtually
no
computation
throughout
the
life
of
the
patent
in
swing
diffusers.
not
just
a
patent
of
swing
diffusers
but
any
swing
diffusers.
so
that
there
are
facts
in
this
record
which
show
not
only
there
was
control
of
prices
and
control
of
competition,
but
that
the
relevant
--
what
the
relevant
market
was.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
would
say
diffusion
equipment
including
the
swing
diffusers.
and
on
page
76
and
77
there's
quite
a
discussion
of
that
a
very
poor
form
showing
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
the
record
shows
that
when
we
bid
on
diffusers
per
se,
and
this
is
on
77,
and
got
the
award
that
the
municipality
was
persuaded
unless
we
have
their
swing
diffuser,
we
shouldn't
be
even
allowed
to
put
in
our
diffusers.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
no,
the
case
is
not
gone
to
evidence
yet.
there
has
been
no
real
evidence
taken
on
the
point
of
the
monopolization.
the
evidence
was
taken
on
the
issue
of
fraud.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
that
isn't
in
the
record
and
i
know
of
none
on
this
patent,
of
course
the
patent
has
expired.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
that's
my
understanding.
that
would
--
the
record
would
so
indicate.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
oh,
i
would
take
it
would
be.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
the
--
in
order
to
file
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
--
the
patent
there
must
be
an
old
file
representing
that
there
was
no
prior
public
use
more
than
a
year
before.
that
oath
was
filed
in
accordance
with
the
patent
office
rules
and
it's
my
understanding
that
there
is
a
criminal
statute
which
would
apply.
of
course
the
statue
would
be
--
the
statute
limitations
has
long
passed
on
it.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
don't
know.
i
should
--
there
are
some
cases
that
i
can't
held
in
my
fingertips
that
might
--
would
indicate
it
starts
when
the
oath
is
made.
we
didn't
find
out
about
it
for
sure
until
well
into
1962,
and
our
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
not
filed
until
september
of
1962.
and
up
to
that
time,
there
was
no
definite
proof
of
it
in
our
opinion.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
i
think
they
would
have
to
show
that
there
was
some
damage.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
think
they'd
have
to
show
that
somebody
was
harmed
by
reason
of
it.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
in
order
to
recover
any
damages
or
to
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
into
criminal
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
i
think
they
could.
i
think
they
could.
and
if
i
could
answer
it
in
that
same
connection
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
to
mr.
friedman
as
to
the
matter
of
whether
we
claim
that
this
should
apply
to
more
than
fraud,
whether
a
state
should
be,
justify
such
an
action.
it's
my
position
that
anything
that
can
be
shown
to
be
bad
faith
and
that's
what
some
of
these
cases
have
held
that
i
cited,
should
be
the
basis
for
such
an
action.
in
other
words,
if
the
patent
have
--
if
the
patent
infringement
suit
is
brought
in
bad
faith
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
monopolization,
i
think
there
might
be
an
action.
but
just
on
a
simple
mistake,
i
do
not
think
so
and
there's
a
reason
which
i
don't
know
that
mr.
friedman
would
have
like
to
have
set
forth
because
the
person
who
issues
the
patent
is
the
government.
and
if
the
government
issued
the
patent
period
by
a
mistake,
there
might
be
a
question
of
government
liability
or
sovereign
immunity
comes
in
but
isn't
what
it
used
to
be
and
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
it's
my
position.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
because
so
long
as
the
patent
owner
is
operating
in
good
faith,
under
the
basis
of
a
government
grant
of
the
patent,
i
don't
think
he
could
possibly
commit
a
wrong.
it's
only
when
he's
not
operating
in
good
faith
that
i
think
any
wrong
could
be
done.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
on
the
question
of
intent,
i
would
agree.
but
i
think
that
this
court,
as
well
as
other
courts,
i
don't
have
the
citations
here,
has
always
held
that
a
patent
issue
is
a
shield
against
the
antitrust
laws
and
it
has
been
so
considerate.
i
don't
think
that
shield
should
be
asserted
where
the
thing
is
a
--
where
the
patent
has
been
obtained
in
bad
faith
and
that's
my
position
here.
the
matter
of
the
fmc
as
against
chicago
pump
has
never
been
raised
before,
fraud
as
a
matter
will
have
to
prove
if
we
get
them
when
we
go
back.
mr.
collen
did
not
answer
my
statement
earlier
what
i
made
in
my
opening
that
in
1956,
on
page
16
of
the
record,
we
wrote
them
a
letter
saying
that
it
had
come
to
our
attention
that
there
was
a
possible
fraud
in
this
connection.
and
record
62
shows
that
they
--
while
they
replied,
they
denied
any
duty
to
look
into
the
matter.
and
certainly,
from
that
time
on,
i
think
we
have
no
problem
that
the
papers
that
which
showed
fraud
were
all
in
their
possession
as
it
turned
out
and
that's
a
matter
of
proof
we'll
have
to
face
when
the
time
comes
but
it
isn't
here.
