mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
is
participating
in
this
case
as
an
amicus
because
of
its
disagreement
with
the
ruling
below,
that
a
charge
of
monopolization
and
violation
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
cannot
be
predicated
upon
the
enforcement
of
a
patent
that
was
procured
by
fraud
on
the
patent
office.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
outset
as
my
colleague
has
done,
that
as
the
case
comes
here
--
it
comes
on
the
dismissal
of
the
counterclaim.
so
we
must
assume
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
the
petitioner
can
prove
what
he
alleges,
there
are
some
suggestion
by
our
opponents
that
in
fact
this
doesn't
amount
to
fraud.
i
think
that's
a
question
that's
not
in
the
case
at
this
point.
we
take
two
positions
here
and
i
might
just
mention
in
passing,
we
take
no
position
on
the
propriety
of
the
denial
of
the
award
of
attorney's
fees,
we
take
two
positions
here.
first,
we
think
that
the
stated
basis
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
dismissed
this
counterclaim,
that
the
maintenance
of
this
suit
would
amount
to
an
illegal
attempt
to
annul
a
patent,
not
permissible
because
only
the
united
states
may
bring
such
as
suit,
is
plainly
an
untenable
basis
for
its
decision.
and
indeed,
as
far
as
we
can
read
the
respondent's
brief,
they
no
longer
really
seek
to
defend
that
ground.
and
secondly,
we
shall
argue
that
passing
that
point
for
the
moment,
the
complaint
in
this
case
does
state
a
violation
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
and
that
the
petitioner
therefore
should
have
been
permitted
to
go
to
trial
on
that
issue.
now
i'd
like
first
to
discuss
the
grounds
given
by
the
court
of
appeals,
that
is,
they
said
is
a
well-settled
rule
that
only
the
united
states
may
bring
an
action
to
annul
or
cancel
a
patent.
and
they
said
that
to
permit
this
action
to
go
forward
where
the
claim
is,
that
the
patent
was
illegally
procured
would
do
violence
to
that
rule.
we
think
the
short
answer
to
that
is
that
no
relief
that
would
be
given
in
this
case
would
in
effect
annul
the
patent.
and
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
various
authorities
in
favor
of
that
proposition
and
all
i
would
like
to
do
here
is
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
another
case
which
unfortunately
we
did
not
cite
which
we
think
is
virtually
dispositive
in
this
point.
and
that
as
this
court's
opinion
in
the
first
gypsum
case,
united
states
v.
united
states
gypsum
company
in
333
u.s.
364.
that
was
a
civil
antitrust
case
brought
by
the
government
alleging
violations
of
section
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act
and
the
claim
was
an
illegal
combination
in
conspiracy
to
restrain
and
monopolize,
accomplished
through
various
patent
licensing
practices.
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court,
the
defendants
conceded
that
if
they
didn't
have
the
protection
of
the
patents,
their
practices
would
be
illegal.
but
they
claim
the
patents
gave
them
a
full
defense.
at
this
point,
the
government
move
to
amend
its
complaint
to
add
another
paragraph
alleging
that
the
patents
themselves
were
invalid
for
a
large
number
of
grounds,
seven
or
eight
grounds.
the
district
court
refused
to
permit
that
amendment.
the
district
court
thought
that
allowing
such
a
claim
in
the
suit
wouldn't
effect
amount
to
a
prohibited
attempt
by
the
united
states
in
that
case
to
challenge
the
patent
and
to
secure
its
annulment.
now,
this
court
in
its
decision
in
the
gypsum
case,
although
recognizing
that
that
issue
was
not
crucial
as
the
way
the
case
came
out,
nevertheless
went
out
of
its
way,
specifically
to
reject
that
ruling,
pointing
out
it
would
be
most
unfortunate
to
leave
as
a
precedent.
and
i'd
like
to
read
to
the
court
two
sentences
from
its
decision
on
this
point
which
is
at
page
387,
at
333
united
states
and
the
court
stated.
“the
united
states
does
not
claim
that
the
patents
are
invalid
because
they
have
been
employed
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
and
that
a
decree
should
issue
canceling
the
patents;
rather,
the
government
charges
that
the
defendants
have
violated
the
sherman
act
because
they
granted
licenses
under
patents
which
in
fact
were
invalid.”
now
i
come
particularly
emphasize
the
second
sentence.
“if
the
government
were
to
succeed
in
showing
that
the
patents
were
in
fact
invalid,
such
a
finding
would
not
itself
result
in
a
judgment
for
cancellation
of
the
patents.”
and
we
think
this
same
reasoning
is
fully
applicable
in
this
case.
here,
the
petitioner
is
not
claiming
that
the
patent
is
invalid
because
it
was
illegally
used
to
monopolize
or
seeking
cancellation
of
the
patent,
rather
the
charge
is
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
because
the
conduct
was
based
on
a
patent
that
was
invalid.
and
just
as
in
the
gypsum
case,
we
think
it
quite
clear
here
that
if
the
ultimate
result
in
this
case
is
a
finding
of
monopolization
based
on
a
finding
that
the
patent
was
obtained
by
fraud,
such
a
finding
and
the
words
of
gypsum
would
not
itself
result
in
a
judgment
for
cancellation
of
the
patent.
so
we
think
the
stated
basis
for
the
decision
is
plainly
untenable.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
was
the
party.
that's
correct
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
but
the
--
the
rationale
it
seems
to
us
is
equally
applicable
because
in
gypsum,
the
court
said
that
the
united
states
could
not
bring
the
suit
because
the
district
court
erroneously
believe
that
that
was
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
permitted
even
to
the
united
states
and
this
court
rejected
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
and
said,
“no,
this
is
not
an
attempt
to
annul
or
cancel
a
patent.”
now,
in
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i'd
like
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i'll
tell
you
right
now
mr.
justice.
i
think
what
will
have
to
be
shown
are
the
following
--
one,
the
allegation
of
the
complaint
that
the
patent
was
obtained
by
knowingly
misrepresenting
to
the
patent
office
that
there
was
in
fact
no
prior
invention
more
than
a
year
of
the
date
of
filing,
that's
the
first
allegation.
secondly,
they
will
have
to
be
show
not
only
that
they
had
the
patent
but
that
they
enforced
it
against
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
no,
that's
not
merely
the
possession
of
the
patent
but
the
allegations
that
they
make,
that
they
lost
a
great
deal
of
business.
in
fact,
they
were
actually
excluded
from
the
markets
for
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
on
the
relevant
market
mr.
justice
--
we
have
an
alternative
argument.
the
first
argument
we
have
is
that
at
least
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
the
allegations
here
is
sufficient
to
allow
them
to
go
to
try,
that's
our
first
argument.
this
was
not
the
basis,
relevant
market
on
which
the
lower
court
decided
the
case.
the
complaint
charges
monopolization
--
if
it
felt
necessary
to
define
the
relevant
market
in
this
type
of
a
case,
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
matter
that
properly
can
be
developed
at
further
pretrial
proceedings,
possibly
in
other
amendment
of
the
complaint.
now
that's
our
first
position.
if
we
--
i
also
plan
to
discuss
briefly
our
argument
that
we
think
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
there
is
no
need
to
define
the
relevant
market.
and
may
i
say,
to
be
clear
on
this,
when
i
say
this
kind
of
a
case,
i
learned
it
myself
specifically
to
the
situation,
where
a
claim
of
illegal
monopolization
rest
on
the
enforcement
of
a
patent
procured
by
fraud.
now
i'm
planning
to
come
to
that
in
a
few
minutes
and
to
develop
the
latter
point
of
them
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
--
that's
the
question
mr.
justice
on
which
really
the
government
doesn't
take
any
position
whether
this
pleading
is
sufficient
as
a
matter
of
pleading.
i
mean,
i
think
that
would
--
that's
again
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
has
never
been
raised,
that's
correct.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
again
would
be
a
matter
properly
to
be
considered
by
the
trial
court
in
the
first
instance
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
alternative
argument,
we
would
say
that
there's
no
need
for
relevant
market
at
all.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
if
there
is
a
need
for
a
relevant
market,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
not
a
matter
that
has
to
be
disposed
at
this
point.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that's
right.
whether
claim
of
illegal
monopolization
rests
on
the
enforcement
of
the
patent
procured
by
fraud
and
i
--
as
i
will
come
to
develop
why
we
think
this
is
an
appropriate
rule
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
means,
for
example,
that
it
had
not
--
did
not
sufficiently
provide
any
novelty
invention
--
yes,
i
think
that
would
--
wouldn't
make
a
difference.
well,
again
mr.
justice,
we
recognized
that
if
a
patent
has
been
obtained
in
good
faith
--
in
good
faith,
where
the
patentee
has
attempted
in
good
faith
to
get
the
monopoly
which
the
patent
laws
provide,
that
is
not
the
kind
--
the
exercise
of
that
power
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
against
which
the
sherman
act
is
directed.
but
we're
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
we
think
it
would
certainly
make
a
difference.
invalid
--
if
i
may
suggest
mr.
justice,
the
words
“invalidly
obtained
patent”
--
i
put
in
the
word
“knowingly”.
we
think
the
essential
element
of
this
case
is
the
knowing
aspect
of
it,
that
they
intentionally
obtain
this
power
by
knowingly
misrepresenting
the
facts
for
the
patent.
that
we
think
is
the
essence.
because
in
the
normal
case
where
someone
has
a
patent,
he
is
merely
exercising
the
power
which
congress
has
given,
it
means
he's
getting
a
reward
for
his
invention.
and
if
it
should
late
to
turn
out
that
the
rewards
for
the
invention
was
improperly
granted
because,
let's
say
it
wasn't
a
true
invention,
in
that
situation,
as
long
as
he
was
attempting
to
exercise
the
power
which
he,
in
good
faith,
had
sought
to
obtain,
it
seems
to
me
this
is
fully
what
is
contemplated
by
the
patent
laws.
but
we
think
this
is
a
quite
different
case.
this
is
the
unusual
case
where
the
claim
is
that
he
obtained
the
power
initially
improperly.
now,
this
court
in
a
large
number
of
decisions,
has
recognized
that
where
a
patentee
sues
for
infringement,
the
alleged
infringer
is
permitted
to
raise
the
defense
that
the
patent
had
been
obtained
by
fraud.
and
those
decisions
rest
basically
as
we
read
them.
on
the
fact
that
because
a
patent
does
give
a
natural
monopoly,
that
it
gives
the
absolute
right
to
exclude,
is
a
very
strong
public
interest
in
making
sure
that
this
power
is
not
obtained
from
the
government
through
deceptive
practice.
now,
it
seems
to
us
the
same
considerations
apply
the
importance
of
opening
up
to
the
public
of
permitting
the
public
to
be
protected
against
monopolies
that
were
obtained
improperly
where
the
alleged
illegal
procurement
of
the
patent
is
the
affirmative
case.
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
that
it
should
make
any
difference
whether
it's
offered
as
a
defense
to
an
infringement
suit,
whether
it's
the
basis
upon
which
the
alleged
infringer
suit
succeeds
declaratory
relief,
or
whether
as
in
this
case,
it's
the
basis
of
a
charge
under
the
sherman
act,
because
in
all
situation,
the
basic
policy
upon
which
this
rule
permitting
the
attack
on
fraud
in
the
procurement
of
a
patent
rests,
it
seems
to
us,
would
be
served
in
all
of
these
cases.
now,
with
this
as
a
background,
i
would
now
liked
to
come
to
the
more
specific
question
whether
what
is
alleged
here
is
enough
to
establish
a
violation
of
section
2,
that
is
the
charge
of
monopolization
based
upon
the
enforcement
of
a
patent
procured
by
a
fraud.
monopoly
power
of
course
is
instated
again
and
again
as
the
power
either
to
raise
prices
or
to
exclude
competitors.
as
far
as
the
patent
is
concerned,
there's
no
question
that
--
at
least
for
the
claims
covered
by
the
patent,
that's
exactly
what
the
patentee
has,
so
that's
what
a
patent
is.
the
patent
gives
you
the
right
to
exclude
from
the
subject
matter
of
the
patented
invention.
and
in
addition,
it
seems
fair
to
say
that
when
a
patentee
obtains
from
the
patent
office,
the
right
to
exclude
others
from
practicing
this
invention,
by
definition,
it
has
to
be
something
new
and
novel,
some
advancement
in
the
--
in
the
art
of
what
he's
doing
before,
he
obviously
thinks,
he's
getting
something
a
benefit
to
him.
now,
we
therefore
think
that
if
the
respondent
in
this
case,
food
machinery
and
chemical,
does
have
monopoly
power
by
virtue
of
the
patent,
the
fact
that
such
power
rests
on
a
fraudulently
procured
patent
would
be
enough
to
show
a
violation
of
section
2.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
he
--
if
i'm
just
--
that
passing
mr.
justice,
the
question
of
whether
there
is
monopoly
power,
assuming
there
were
no
question
that
a
particular
firm
had
monopoly
power
in
the
relevant
market,
it
seems
to
me
if
--
whenever
you
could
show
that
that
power
rest
on
a
patent
that
was
procured
by
fraud,
that
would
be
enough
to
show
illegal
monopoly
power.
in
other
words
this
is
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
clear
grasping
for
the
power,
this
is
not
the
thrust
upon
the
alleged
monopoly.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
within
--
where
there
--
which
outcome
to
those
--
once
you
have
the
existence
of
monopoly
power,
we
don't
think
it
could
seriously
be
said
that
that
power
if
it
rest
on
a
fraudulent
procured
patent
is
illegal.
so
the
case
really
comes
down
to
the
question
whether
here,
what
has
been
alleged
is
enough.
in
other
words,
is
there
a
necessity
in
this
case
of
proving
in
addition
to
all
of
these
facts
the
relevant
market?
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice.
as
i
say,
i
think
--
it
think
it's
enough
that
the
court
can
dispose
of
this
case
merely
saying
that
whether
or
not
a
relevant
market
has
to
be
proved,
is
a
question
that
can
be
disposed
within
the
lower
court.
the
reason
i'm
arguing
this
point
is
because
the
respondent
says
with
great
vigor
that
this
suit
does
not
lie
because
there
has
been
no
attempt
to
just
indicate
what
the
relevant
market
is.
and
that's
the
reason
i'm
arguing.
as
i
say,
our
first
argument
is
that,
at
least
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
there's
enough
said
forth.
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
it
seems
to
us
again,
if
a
relevant
market
has
to
be
defined,
conceding
that
not
every
patent
necessarily
would
give
complete
power
to
exclude
from
what
might
be
the
relevant
market,
at
least
where
someone
has
obtained
a
patent
and
enforced
it
in
the
allegation
that
is
done
by,
that
would
be
in
a
prima
facie
at
least
to
show
that
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
the
patent
is
co-extensive
with
the
relevant
market.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
first,
as
i
say
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
would
think
so,
mr.
justice.
and
as
i
say,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
come
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i'd
like
to
--
taking
you
back
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
because
of
the
different
situation
there.
in
the
latter
hypothetical
--
in
the
latter
hypothetical,
the
man
has
--
did
not
have
the
absolute
power
stemming
from
the
patent
to
exclude
some
scope
of
the
patented
invention.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
he
may
or
may
not
have.
he
may
or
may
not
have
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i've
just
say
first
--
first,
that
that
again
it
seems
to
me
is
a
matter
that
should
be
explored
at
the
trial
court.
but
secondly,
i'd
like
to
suggest
to
you
why
we
think
that
doesn't
really
make
any
difference
with
this
case.
and
we
think
--
we
think
that
basically
this
inquires
a
little
analysis
as
to
why
in
the
antitrust
field,
we
look
to
the
relevant
market,
when
it
necessary
and
when
it
isn't.
and
there
are
some
situations
in
the
antitrust
field
where
we
don't
look
to
the
relevant
market.
there
are
other
situations
in
which
we
do.
price
fixing
is
a
common
example
of
a
situation
where
there
has
never
been
any
need
to
define
the
relevant
market,
it's
enough
to
prove
an
agreement
between
people
to
fix
prices.
and
once
that
is
established,
as
long
as
something
more
than
a
de
minimis
amount
of
commerce
is
involved,
that's
the
end
of
it.
in
the
merger
field
on
the
other
hand,
we
always
have
to
define
the
relevant
market
and
the
reason
we
say,
we
have
to
define
the
relevant
market
is
we
have
to
find
out
what
the
effect
of
the
merger
is
on
competition,
and
the
way
you
find
out
that
is
to
see
where
they're
competing.
you
see
where
they
compete
by
defining
the
relevant
market.
but
i'd
like
to
come
back
to
the
price
fixing
situation
for
a
minute,
because
i
suppose
one
could
conceive
of
a
situation,
the
particular
industry
where
there
are
two
people
out
of
enlarged
number
of
firms
who
agree
to
fix
prices.
now,
as
long
as
something
more
than
de
minimis
commerce
is
involved,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law.
yet,
it
might
well
be
in
a
particular
industry
that
the
industry
was
so
structured,
that
the
elimination
of
price
competition
between
these
two
people
would
not
realistically
have
any
substantial
effect
on
competition
in
the
line
of
commerce
involved.
and
i
would
like
to
offer
this
suggestion
for
why
there
seems
to
be
this
dichotomy
in
the
antitrust
laws,
why
it
is
--
in
some
types
of
cases,
we
find
it
necessary
to
analyze
the
relevant
market
and
others
not.
and
i
think
the
explanation
to
those
has
not
been
articulated
in
the
case.
it's
basically
this
--
when
you
have
practices
with
anti-competitive
effect,
the
credible
question
there
is
whether
there
are
any
compensating
factors,
any
things
that
might
offset
the
anti-competitive
effects,
and
therefore
unbalance,
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
practice
which
the
sherman
act
condemns.
and
this
of
course,
has
been
the
--
in
the
per
se
case
that
this
court
has
pointed
out
most
noticeably
in
the
northern
pacific
case,
that
in
that
type
of
situation,
the
certain
types
of
practices
have
presumed
to
have
such
a
pernicious
effect
and
then
this
--
as
this
court
said
in
northern
pacific
that
they
are
illegal,
without
a
labyrinth
inquiry
as
to
the
precise
harm
they
may
have
caused
or
the
business
excuse
for
their
use.
i
think
this
is
pointed
out
very
dramatically
when
we
contrast
the
way
in
which
exclusive
dealing
agreements
and
tying
clauses
are
treated
under
the
antitrust
laws.
tying
clauses
are
generally
considered
to
be
one
of
those
practices
that
have
no
other
effect
other
than
the
suppression
of
competition.
a
market
inquiry
therefore
is
not
required.
those
are
per
se
illegal
as
long
as
there's
a
substantial
effect
was
shown.
on
the
other
hand,
exclusive
dealing
of
contracts
may
or
may
not
have
a
desirable
effect.
and
therefore,
in
that
situation,
we
have
to
go
beyond
this
inquiry
and
look
to
the
relevant
market
to
see
whether
in
fact
they
do
have
a
basically
bad
effect
in
the
market.
now,
with
this
as
the
background,
i
would
like
to
come
to
the
monopoly
situation.
in
a
monopoly
case,
the
fact
that
a
particular
firm
has
a
stated
percentage
of
the
market
for
a
particular
product,
doesn't
itself
tell
us
whether
the
possession
of
that
share
will
or
will
not
harm
competition.
and
therefore,
in
that
situation,
what
we
have
to
do
is
first
to
define
the
relevant
market.
and
then,
look
to
that
market
to
see
what
the
effect
on
competition
is
to
ascertain
whether
the
firm's
share
of
the
particular
product
where
it
has,
for
example,
where
dupont
had
75%
of
cellophane,
whether
that
kind
of
economic
power
is
the
kind
of
power
that
the
antitrust
laws
condemn.
because
in
that
situation,
the
particular
practice
--
in
this
case,
it's
not
a
practice
i
suppose,
that
the
status,
the
market
situation,
may
or
may
not
be
a
bad
thing.
but
when
we
come
to
the
case
of
a
patent
that
is
procured
by
fraud
and
which
is
specifically
--
admittedly
gives
the
power
to
exclude
from
the
particular
item
covered
by
the
invention
and
where
the
patent
is
obtained
for
that
very
purpose,
it
seems
to
us
that
there
can
be
no
question
that
this
is
precisely
the
type
of
economic
misuse
of
power
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
intended
to
condemn.
and
it
certainly,
the
enforcement
of
the
patent
for
that
purpose
is
injurious
to
competition,
where
it's
obtained
by
misleading
the
patent
office.
and
we
therefore
think,
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
it
would
be
fully
consistent
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
say
that
there,
there
is
no
need
for
the
elaborate
analysis
of
the
market
to
ascertain
what
needs
and
bounds
of
the
relevant
market
are,
that
--
it's
enough
in
that
situation
we
think
that
there
is
a
patent,
that
it
has
been
procured
by
fraud
in
the
patent
office,
and
that
it's
being
used
to
exclude
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
on
this
aspect
of
it,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there's
no
defense
except
the
defenses
as
to
whether
they
have
in
fact
the
same
patent
(voice
overlap)
by
fraud
and
whether
they
enforced
it
against.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
the
damages,
of
course,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
if
the
court
does
not
agree
with
us
on
that,
there
is
still
--
i
think
it
should
go
back
to
develop
and
--
at
the
district
court
level
what
the
relevant
market
is
against
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
again,
this
is
a
question
--
we
don't
take
--
the
government
doesn't
take
any
position
as
to
whether
if
relevant
market
has
to
be
shown
whether
this
complaint
sufficiently
alleged.
i
think
again,
this
would
be
a
matter
for
the
district
court,
the
district
court
did
attempt
to
decide
the
case
on
that
basis,
and
it
seems
to
me
in
the
first
instance
that
the
trial
court
should
now
be
given
an
opportunity
to
see
whether
this
complaint
is
deficient
and
in
further
whether
an
amendment
might
be
appropriate.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
don't
think
it
should
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
believe,
as
i
suggested
earlier,
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
pass
on
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
mr.
justice
that
is
our
position
that
they
procure
the
enforcement
of
a
patent
procured
by
fraud
without
more
is
enough
to
establish
the
legal
monopolization
under
section
2.
as
i've
tried
to
indicate
yesterday,
if
the
court
is
unwilling
to
accept
that
argument,
we
suggest
that
in
any
event,
in
any
event,
a
case
maybe
grounded
upon
the
enforcement
of
a
patent
procured
by
fraud
in
the
sense
that
if
that
patent
is
deemed
to
give
monopoly
power
in
the
relevant
market,
if
the
relevant
market
is
a
critical
consideration,
that
the
obtaining
of
the
power
through
the
procurement
of
the
patent
by
fraud
that
is
enough
to
show
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
say
this
mr.
justice.
we
do
it
in
limited
case
for
the
reasons
i
have
given.
now
of
course
we
recognize
that
in
terms
of
the
market
and
as
i
think
this
court
is
self-recognized
in
the
footnote
in
the
northern
pacific
opinion
that
not
every
patent
in
the
classical
sense
necessarily
gives
a
monopoly
and
that
it
has
complete
power
to
exclude
from
all
competing
substitutes.
i
mean
some
patents
by
definition
may
have
a
very
small
increment
of
advancement
over
other
patents
but
we
suggest
basically
two
things.
i
think,
one,
as
i
attempted
to
argue
yesterday,
when
you
deal
with
a
special
case
of
a
patent
that
is
procured
by
a
fraud,
the
considerations
which
normally
apply
to
defining
a
market
don't
apply.
and
then
the
second
point
i
tried
to
make
was
--
which
i
just
made
a
moment
--
trying
to
make
a
moment
ago
to
you,
if
it
was
--
if
that
argument
is
to
be
rejected,
if
in
fact
even
in
this
case
the
market
need
be
defined,
still
the
case
should
go
back
as
we
do
think
that
even
if
the
market
has
to
be
defined,
the
market
power
that
rest
on
a
fraudulent
procured
patent
is
enough
in
that
situation
to
ground
illegal
monopoly
if
the
requisite
market
position
is
sustained.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
the
distinction
is
that
there
is
nothing
fundamentally
improper
in
attempting
to
assert
your
rights
under
a
patent
that
the
government
has
given
you
were
in
good
faith,
you
have
obtained
it,
believing
you
have
an
invention.
if
it
turns
out
you're
wrong
later
on,
if
it
turns
out
that
contrary
to
your
views,
this
is
not
a
valid
patent,
there's
nothing
odious
about
that.
but
it
seems
this
is
a
quite
different
case
where
you
knowingly
obtained
from
the
government
the
power
to
exclude
people
from
the
product
covered
by
the
patent,
it
seems
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
i
think
that
there
are
areas
mr.
justice
where
you
do
look,
you
do
look
to
the
basic
intention
with
which
the
power
was
acquired.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
now,
i
would
suggest
incidentally
mr.
justice.
may
i
make
one
suggestion
here
that
i
don't
know
conceivably
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
alleged,
it
might
be
appropriate
in
the
course
of
amending
the
pleading
to
amend
it
to
suggest
and
attempt,
i
suppose
if
in
fact
that
is
what
is
shown
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
when
we
--
we
suggest
that
this
is
a
special
case.
this
is
a
special
case.
i
mean
here
what
you
have,
here
what
you
have
is
the
monopoly
power
or
the
power,
the
power
to
exclude
which
patent
gives
is
procured
improperly.
it's
obtained,
the
power
to
exclude
whatever
it
is
excluding
from,
the
power
to
exclude
is
obtained
by
virtue
of
making
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
get
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
yes,
mr.
justice,
where
you
obtain
it.
where
you
obtain
it
--
where
you
obtain
it
to
misrepresenting
the
facts
to
the
government,
you
cannot
then
rely
on
it
as
a
basis
for
excluding
others.
i
think
that
is
our
position.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
precisely
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is,
there
is
certainly
mr.
justice,
but
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct,
it
may
well
be
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
may
well
be
if
this
case
goes
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
and
--
if
--
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice,
the
allegation
here
is
that
they
knowingly
--
they
know
it.
they
obtained
this
patent
knowing
there
had
been
a
prior
use,
that
they
have
made
a
full
statement.
if
this
particular
affidavit
turns
out
not
to
satisfy
those
standards,
i
think
there's
no
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
suppose
--
i
just
haven't
gone
in
to
that
extent.
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
some
knowledge,
something
--
so
put
it
this
way
mr.
justice.
i
would
say
something
that
would
shock
the
conscience
of
the
court
that
would
make
the
court
believe
it
was
improper.
they
had
obtained
a
patent
improperly
in
a
sense
that
they
knowingly
were
getting
monopoly,
they
had
no
right
to
get
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
did.
no,
i'm
sorry.
this
case
did
not
go
off
on
the
pleading
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
in
that
sense
it
went
off
on
the
pleading
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
the
sense
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
well
that's
of
course,
correct.
i
mean
the
case
went
off
on
the
assumption
that
he
could
prove
what
he
had
alleged,
that
that
didn't
allege
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
the
allegation
speaks
of
the
plaintiff.
it
says
at
page
60
of
the
record
paragraph
15.
it
says
plaintiff
including
its
predecessor.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
including
its
predecessor.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
wouldn't
think
so
mr.
justice.
but
i
do
point
out
this
to
you
that
there's
again
a
dispute
that
it
was
a
letter
which
was
written
in
1956
calling
the
attention
of
fmc
to
the
fact
of
prior
use,
so
that
it
may
be
that
in
effect
they
could
be
--
i
don't
know,
again,
this
would
be
a
question
for
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
proof,
they
might
say
that
in
fact
having
continue
to
enforce
the
patent
and
brought
this
suit
after
this
knowledge,
they
are
now
--
the
knowledge
of
their
predecessor
may
be
imputed.
and
in
the
comment,
i
did
state
in
referring
at
page
60
to
the
obtaining
the
patent
well
knowing
that
it
--
that
is
the
plaintiff
had
no
basis
for,
this
again
it
seem
to
--
will
be
a
question
of
proof.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
did
not
intend
to
suggest
that
mr.
justice.
