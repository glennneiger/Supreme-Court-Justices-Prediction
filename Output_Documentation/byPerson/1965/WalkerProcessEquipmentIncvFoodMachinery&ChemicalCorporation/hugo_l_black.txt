that
would
be
in
all
cases
of
this
fact,
where
there's
a
fraud
on
patent
office
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
we
didn't
agree
with
you
though,
this
case
have
to
be
affirmed
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
although
you
didn't
allege
that
other
kind
of
alleged?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
assuming
that
that
is
irrelevant
to
the
case,
why
is
that
--
why
does
that
rise
above
anything
except
an
amendable
defense?
why
should
the
lawsuit
be
thrown
out
of
court
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
why
do
we
have
to
decide
it
here
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
name
of
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
on
the
basis
of
the
knowledge
that
the
man
has
at
the
time
he
gets
the
patent,
that
its
there
whatever
it
is.
are
you
drawing
a
distinction
between
an
ordinary
patent
which
nobody
can
tell
whether
it's
valid
or
not
until
they
try
it
out
and
may
be
then
they
won't
know.
and
you'd
say
there
that
the
man
can't
be
held
guilty
of
violating
the
monopoly
law
or
intending
to
do
it
because
all
he
intended
to
do
was
to
use
what
he
considers
to
be
a
valid
patent.
are
you
drawing
a
distinction
between
that
and
when
where
the
man
who
gets
the
patent,
gets
it
with
knowledge,
it's
no
good,
he
is
getting
it
in
the
way
that
he'd
perjure
himself
in
order
to
get
it.
therefore
you
say
that
in
that
instant,
he
has
gotten
the
monopoly
as
the
benefits
of
a
monopoly
out
of
the
patent,
or
is
trying
to
and
if
he
is
guilty
of
monopolizing
or
intending
to
monopolize?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not
say
that
if
the
patent
might
later
be
found
to
be
invalid
that
necessarily
means
that
a
man
violates
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
here
you
claim
that
--
your
basic
--
whether
right
or
wrong,
as
i
understand
it,
on
the
premise.
this,
as
you
charge,
if
this
man
committed
perjury
to
get
it,
stating
it
was
patentable
when
he
knew
it
wasn't,
that
he
knew
from
the
very
beginning
it
was
not
patentable,
and
he
was
trying
to
use
it
for
the
purpose
that
the
man
can
use
a
legitimate
patent,
which
is
to
monopolize,
fix
prices,
and
fix
the
term
of
sale
of
the
commodity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
hope
i
didn't
understand
you
to
(inaudible)
in
order
for
us
to
decide
even
in
whole
or
in
part
on
your
side,
we
have
assume
that
it's
law
that
when
a
man
gets
the
patent
(inaudible)
conviction
of
the
court,
he
thereby
violates
the
antitrust
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
an
extension
of
the
(inaudible)
doctrine
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
i
wouldn't
want
to
read.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
sorry
to
take
