justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
mr.
friedman
--
justice
byron
r.
white
won't
they
just
come
to
prove
the
section
2
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever
the
elements
are
in
the
section
2
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
have
to
prove
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
relevant
market
is
required,
how
about
the
necessity
of
the
pleadings?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
issue
has
never
been
raised
anywhere
in
the
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
suggesting
you
have
an
alternative
argument
which
would
dispense
with
this
trial,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
there
--
are
we
going
to
have
to
decide
that
aim?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know,
let's
just
assume
there's
a
competing
product,
as
stiff
and
as
good
as
yours,
the
only
the
thing
is
that
it
doesn't
infringe,
and
there's
a
patent
of
device
that
does
this
job
very
well
and
there's
an
unpatented
device,
the
competing
device,
or
another
patent
device
for
that
matter,
two
patents
of
device
do
this
job
very
well
in
the
relevant
market.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
the
one
--
that
the
fellow
--
the
fellow
who
exercises
his
right
in
this
market
under
a
fraudulently
obtained
patent
violates
the
antitrust
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
that
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
there's
either
--
that
neither
product
were
patented.
you
wouldn't
think
that
either
one
of
them
violated
--
would
be
violating
section
2,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
just
by
telling
their
product?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
all
he's
got
though.
but
he
hasn't
had
the
power
to
exclude
the
market.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
i
thought
was
that
--
that
he
didn't
have
because
of
another
product
that
could
do
just
as
well.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
--
it's
not
only
a
prima
facie
case
then
if
i
would
understand
the
--
you
would
say,
but
a
conclusive
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
a
--
of
monopolization?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
proved
that
as
conclusive?
there's
no
need
for
--
there's
no
defense,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
page
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
the
--
except
yesterday,
the
answer
was
that
they
are
asserting
the
other
position.
they
may
not
have
before,
i
don't
know
about
that.
but
yesterday,
the
assertion
was
that
if
we
do
not
agree
with
them
that
this
is
a
per
se
matter
that
the
--
that
they
think
the
case
should
be
remanded
for
the
proceedings
in
the
trial
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
--
they
wouldn't
have
done
them
any
good
in
the
lower
courts.
in
the
theory
of
the
lower
court,
they've
applied
anything
they
wanted
to
and
it
wouldn't
have
got
them
to
first
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
the
--
this
court
of
appeals,
it
seems
to
me
would've
have
thrown
them
out
no
matter
what
they
plead.
this
was
an
effort
to
cancel
the
patent
and
only
the
united
states
had
the
right
to
cancel
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
position
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
that
this
was
--
that
this
couldn't
be
made
an
antitrust
case
at
all,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yours
was
the
same
position
that
the
court
took?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
never
say
it
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
ever
raised
by
anybody
in
the
lower
court
as
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
as
to
whether
this
pleading
was
sufficient
in
terms
of
the
relevant
market
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
it,
swing
diffusion?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
evidence.
there's
not
--
there's
no
evidence
constructed
to
show
what
other
things
besides
swing
diffusers
could
do
the
job
that
swing
diffusers
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
doesn't
reach
it
quite,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
licensees
of
the
patentee
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
patentee
made
and
sold
them
all
himself?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
a
--
is
this
kind
of
fraud
a
--
if
it
were
proved,
is
it
a
criminal,
is
it
a
violation
of
any
criminal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
general
--
is
this
the
general
fraudulent
misrepresentation?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
that
start
to
run
when
they
opened
this
file
or
when
somebody
learns
it
was
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
for
maybe
for
attempts
to
monopolize,
but
i'm
not
--
i
thought
was
sort
of
an
--
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
was
irrelevant,
it
was
actually
monopolization
which
you
say
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
i
was
--
could
understand
that.but
your
general
rule
of
--
the
general
question
is,
why
wouldn't
this
apply
for
invalidity
for
lack
of
invention.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
feel
that
the
patent
is
lost
through
that
basis
and
nothing
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
shield
that
the
patent
affords
you
from
the
antitrust
laws
is
lost
for
bad
faith
but
nothing
else,
that's
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
the
--
was
it
the
big
argument
about
what
a
prior
use
is
too,
isn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
may
--
a
fellow
might
in
a
very
good
faith
think
he
had
--
there
hasn't
been
a
prior
use.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
he
may
--
you
may
prove
he's
wrong
too
and
if
there
was
a
â€œfraud'
on
the
patent
office
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
disclose
a
prior
use
for
this
perfectly
good
faith?
