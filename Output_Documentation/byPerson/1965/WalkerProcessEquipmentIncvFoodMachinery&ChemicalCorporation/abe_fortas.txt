justice
abe
fortas
counsel,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
suppose
that
paragraph
20
were
not
abandoned,
paragraph
20
in
the
counterclaims
were
not
abandoned
by
the
petitioner,
you
claim
that
it
has
been
abandoned?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
allegation
of
tie-in.
is
it
your
position
that
if
that
paragraph
is
still
alive
and
not
abandoned,
nevertheless
this
counterclaim
does
not
state
a
cause
of
action?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
may
or
may
not
be
premature
at
this
stage.
but
let
me
ask
you
another
question,
suppose
the
counterclaim
alleged
in
general
terms
that
the
plaintiff
had
monopolized
trade
in
commerce,
proposition
one.
proposition
2,
that
plaintiff
had
done
this
by
use
of
a
patent.
proposition
three,
that
the
patent
was
fraudulently
obtained.
suppose
the
counterclaim
had
said
that
or
couldn't
be
construed
to
say
that,
would
it
still
be
your
position
that
it
would
not
state
a
valid
cause
of
action?
justice
abe
fortas
but
sir,
when
you
look
at
it
from
a
point
of
view
the
antitrust
law,
does
it
make
any
difference
why
the
patent
is
invalid?
as
i
understand
you
now,
you're
asserting
the
proposition
that
if
someone
uses
a
patent
and
if
that
patent
is
invalid
because
it
was
fraudulently
obtained,
there
follows
automatically
a
cause
of
action
under
the
antitrust
laws
regardless
of
what
the
patent
is
or
what
it
covers,
regardless
of
general
market
conditions.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
my
understanding
that
that
is
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
now
if
that
is
so,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
antitrust
laws,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
the
invalidity
of
the
patent
was
due
to
fraudulent
procurement
or
to
some
other
reason?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
in
terms
of
antitrust
doctrine,
it's
my
understanding
that
good
faith
or
bad
faith
is
inconsequential.
