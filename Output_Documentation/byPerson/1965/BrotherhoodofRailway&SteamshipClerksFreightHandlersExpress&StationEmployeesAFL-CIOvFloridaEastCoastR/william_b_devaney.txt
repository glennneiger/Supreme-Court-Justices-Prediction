mr.
william
b.
devaney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may
at
the
outset
apply
immediately
to
the
question
that
mr.
bender
has
raised
at
the
very
end
of
his
argument
namely,
the
fact
that
florida
east
coast
has
not
raised
the
right
to
use
supervisors
and
to
otherwise
operate
with
the
employees
if
it
had
available
and
we
have
not
challenged
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
make
these
determinations.
i
would
like
only
to
refer
to
our
petition
--
cross-petition
for
certiorari.
on
page
30,
this
is
question
number
2.
on
page
32,
of
our
initial
brief
and
on
page
36
of
our
reply
brief,
i
believe
it's
very
clear
that
we
have
said
consistently
all
the
way
through
this
proceeding
that
that
is
the
position
that
we
have
taken.
now,
before
getting
into
the
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
this
is
the
position
that
mr.
.bender
suggested
that
there
might
be
things
such
as
the
use
of
supervisors
that
we
could
do
and
that
we
didn't
raise
the
question
and
that
if
the
unions
had
been
asked
about
it
and
there
the
disagreement
it
would
go
to
the
adjustment
board.
now,
we
have
raised
that
consistently
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
said
that
what
the
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
oh,
i
did.
i
did,
mr.
justice
brennan.
on
page
3
of
our
petition
that
is
question
number
2
which
concerns
directly
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
to
determine
the
questions
of
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
agreement
and
we
argued
the
same
points
at
page
32
of
our
initial
brief
and
36
of
our
reply
brief.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
there
is
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
did
not.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
did
not
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
--
we
didn't
raise
it
with
the
unions,
mr.
chief
justice
and
they
didn't
raise
it
with
us.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that's
correct.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
never
contended
or
asserted
the
right
to
do
anything
except
what
was
necessary
under
the
strike
conditions
in
order
to
operate
the
railroad.
that's
all
we
have
insisted
that
we
have
the
right
to
do.
and
when
the
strike
began
we
had
absolutely
no
employees,
but
supervisors
and
when
we
operated
the
first
train
on
february
the
3rd,
we
used
supervisors
because
this
was
the
only
way
we
could
operate
and
in
using
the
supervisors
we
clearly
crossed
every
craft
line
imaginable.
we
had
to
run
them
through
terminals.
we
have
to
have
them
do
the
yard
work,
local
freight
work,
inspect
their
own
locomotives,
they
fueled
their
own
diesels,
they
did
everything
that
was
required
to
be
done,
because
there
was
not
anybody
else
who
could
do
this
work
for
the
railroad.
as
we
began
to
hire
replacements,
in
the
first
place
when
it
wasn't
hired
until
more
than
a
month
after
we
ran
the
first
train,
it
was
in
april
and
we
hired
one
man
in
april.
now,
with
one
man
we
have
to
use
his
skills
and
ability
to
do
whatever
he
could
do.
it
is
conceded
all
the
way
through
that
we
could
not
hire
qualified
employees.
they
were
basically
unqualified
and
we
have
to
train
them.
it
was
earlier
asked
about
training
time
well,
in
shop
class
alone,
there
is
a
four-year
apprenticeship
program
which
is
required.
we
couldn't
get
the
journeymen
and
to
train
these
people
under
the
agreements
themselves
would
take
a
period
of
four
years.
so
we
have
no
alternative
but
to
hire
people
with
as
much
skill
as
we
could
find
and
we
have
to
use
those
skills
the
best
way
we
could.
and
if
the
men
were
not
fully
qualified
to
perform
the
work
of
machinist,
he
had
to
do
whatever
part
of
that
job
he
could
do
and
we
have
something
else
that
somebody
else
could
do.
we
have
to
use
another
person
to
try
and
fill
in
and
do
the
job
and
to
keep
the
railroad
operating.
that's
what
we
did.
it
was
asked
earlier
to
what
we
do
about
payment
well,
there's
no
question
about
this.
when
the
strike
replacement
problem
first
came
up
in
april,
the
only
way
we
could
get
replacements
was
to
pay
them
on
a
salary
basis.
i
think
it's
perfectly
understandable
why
they
might
have
wanted
a
salary.
they
didn't
know
and
the
railroad
didn't
know
whether
we
could
operate
this
railroad
one
day
or
two
days
or
a
week
or
whether
it
would
be
successful
but
he
wanted
a
salary.
the
record
shows
that
we
took
the
hourly
rates
in
the
contract,
we
converted
them
to
a
salary,
that's
what
we
did.
in
addition
to
that
we
did
because
of
severe
shortage
of
clerical
employees.
we
did
take
the
holiday
pay
provisions
and
included
that
in
these
base
rates.
every
one
of
the
agreements
had
a
different
eligibility
provision.
and
we
just
didn't
have
the
personnel
to
keep
all
the
records
required
so
we
put
it
all
into
the
base
rate.
now,
except
for
those
changes,
this
is
what
the
people
were
paying
and
as
early
as
april,
when
we
were
beginning
to
get
a
few
more
replacement
employees,
we
started
moving
back
to
the
hourly
base,
the
hourly
rate.
now
what
we
have
to
do,
and
we
don't
deny,
it
is
perfectly
clear
in
the
record
that
we
had
no
choice
but
to
use
the
people
to
perform
whatever
job
they
could
do.
you
didn't
have
journeyman
machinist,
you
didn't
have
journeyman
electricians.
and
if
we
had
a
man
who
had
been
an
automobile
mechanic,
he'd
done
some
welding
before
he
might
be
working
for
us
as
an
electrician.
but
if
we
needed
the
welding,
we
have
to
use
that
man
to
do
the
welding
if
he
was
the
only
person
available
to
do
it.
this
is
what
we
did.
this
is
what
we
say
we
have
a
right
to
do.
we
say
this
is
what
self-help
means
and
that
is
what
this
case
was
all
about.
really,
the
issue
is,
as
mr.
bender
has
stated,
it's
a
narrow
one.
it's
whether
a
rail
or
an
air
carrier
has
the
right
to
try
to
operate
in
the
face
of
a
strike
with
whatever
personnel
it
has
available
and
it
is
our
position
that
a
carrier
does
have
that
right.
we
say
that
this
is
precisely
what
self-help
means.
it's
what
this
court
and
many
other
courts
have
said
happens
when
procedures
of
the
act
are
exhausted
and
not
only
that
this
court
say
that
the
right,
that
both
parties
have
this
right
of
self-help
but
it's
the
only
right
and
the
only
means
to
adjust
the
dispute
once
the
procedure
of
the
act
are
exhausted.
now,
looking
at
it
in
point
of
time
we
have
seen
that
the
railway
had
no
employees
except
a
handful
of
supervisors
who
were
capable
of
doing
the
various
work
that
was
required.
we
had
to
use
those
people.
we
had
no
choice
whatever.
from
a
workforce
of
2,000,
in
one
day
our
workforce
was
zero.
there
was
no
alternative
on
the
part
of
the
railroad,
but
to
use
such
people
as
we
had
available
and
such
skills
as
they
possessed.
now,
the
government
--
now,
the
union
has
ever
contested
the
complete
impossibility
of
hiring
and
training
the
necessary
replacements.
it
is
conceded
by
all
parties,
that
at
the
time
the
strike
began
and
for
a
very
substantial
period
thereafter
we
couldn't
have
operated
one
train
in
compliance
with
any
of
the
agreements,
not
one
train.
in
fact
the
record
is
clear
and
uncontradicted.
now,
we
could
never
have
got
back
in
service
without
using
supervisors.
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
only
way
we
could
train
these
people
was
by
on
the
--
was
with
on-job-training
and
the
only
way
you
can
give
a
person
on-the-job-training
is
to
operate,
no
other
alternative.
we
had
no
choice
but
to
do
that.
now,
in
operating
with
supervisors
using
the
skills
available,
we
concede
that
this
was
not
in
accordance
with
the
agreements,
but
in
doing
this
we
were
following
of
practice
that
every
railroad
in
the
country
has
followed
for
at
least
40
years
when
it's
faced
with
a
strike
or
some
other
emergency
situation.
now
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
say
that
the
agreement
is
there.
we
say
in
the
first
place
that
wheel
doesn't
change
it's
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
it's
--
we
say
suspended.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
none
whatever
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
--
we
do
not
question
that.
they
clearly
have
that
duty,
very
--
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
well,
your
honor
the
--
at
anytime
the
strike
is
settled,
the
agreements
then
become
full
blown,
fully
applicable
and
must
without
question
be
complied
with
in
every
respect.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
precisely
our
position
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
your
honor
at
any
time,
let
us
take
the
strike
which
began
strictly
as
a
wage
dispute.
now,
just
for
clarity
so
that
they'll
understand
the
possession
of
a
railroad,
the
florida
east
coast
was
not
a
party
to
the
national
handling.
and
the
earlier
recommendation
of
10.28
cents
was
made
by
the
board
before
which
the
florida
east
coast
didn't
appear,
didn't
participate
in
anyway.
we
weren't
parties
to
that
national
bargaining.
now,
when
they
did
go
on
strike
the
issue
at
that
point
was
at
10.28
cents
per
hour.
now,
if
we
had
settled
and
been
to
settle
that
dispute
and
again
let
me
say
the
bargaining
continued
in
1963
on
that
dispute
and
it
has
continued
since
that
time.
there's
been
no
failure,
no
allegation
that
there's
ever
been
any
failure
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
to
bargain
in
good
faith
and
to
fulfill
this
obligation.
but
had
we
settled,
certainly
had
we
settled
before
the
replacement
issue
came
into
being
at
all,
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
would
have
settled
the
entire
dispute.
the
temporary
practices
that
were
--
that
we
had
to
follow
in
that
immediately
upon
the
cessation
of
the
strike.
they
had
no
permanents
at
all.
they
were
not
changes
in
agreements.
they
had
in
no
effect
whatever
on
the
agreements
that
existed
with
these
judgments.
we
have
never
denied,
we've
never
taken
a
position
that
in
an
agreement
can
be
changed
in
anyway.
that
is
a
permanent
agreement
can
be
change
as
in
anyway
except
going
through
all
the
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
oh
yes,
indeed
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
would
have
the
right,
mr.
chief
justice
to
give
a
notice
at
anytime
and
to
proceed
to
negotiate
about
changes,
but
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
--
it
would
not
have
any
effect
until
you've
gone
through
all
the
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act
on
that
notice.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
would
be
no
such
right.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
question
of
the
replacement
is
simply
this.
on
the
florida
east
coast,
they
have
no
--
they
have
no
super
seniority,
that
question
had
never
been
present.
they
were
employed
contrary
what
mr.
bender
may
have
implied.
they
were
employed
in
accordance
with
the
agreement
as
far
as
their
seniority,
their
date
of
hire,
and
so
forth
is
concerned.
they
have
no
special
protection.
the
only
thing
that
they
are
not
subject
to
having
done
to
them
is
to
being
pushed
out
just
automatically
because
the
strikers
would
not
have
an
absolute
right
of
displacement.
over
a
period
of
time,
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
yes,
they
do
gradually
displace.
every
time
a
job
changes,
there's
a
vacancy,
a
promotion,
anything
that
occurs
that
you
have
to
re-advertise
under
the
agreements
that
the
vacant
job,
it
is
bid
on
by
everybody
who
has
seniority.
now
the
strikers
have
continued
to
earn
seniority
during
the
whole
period
that
they'd
been
on
the
strike.
so
that
--
that
no
matter
how
junior
they
may
have
been
before
the
strike
every
one
of
the
strikers
will
always
have
more
seniority
than
the
replacements,
but
it
will
have
to
be
on
a
bidding
basis
not
an
automatic
displacement
right.
they
do
not
have
that.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
this
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
yes,
but
that
is
a
subject
for
bargaining
and
there
has
been
some
bargaining
about
this
variation.
it
certainly
is
a
question
about
which
the
parties
not
only
are
afraid
to
bargain,
but
i
think
the
duty
to
bargain
would
require
that
they
both
sit
down
and
talk
about
that
in
the
same
manner
that
they
would
in
the
other
proposal.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
it
has
proved
to
be
so
up
to
this
point
that
it
is
quite
good.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
there
has
been
no
notice,
no
separate
notice
given
by
the
unions
concerning
this
right
because
again
like
some
of
the
other
cases
in
which
super
seniority
has
been
involved,
they
have
all
the
seniority.
it
merely
is
a
question
of
their
waiting
until
they
have
the
right
and
do
bid
on
the
job.
i
mean,
jobs
are
bid
daily.
so
that
over
a
period
of
time,
yes,
every
time
a
job
is
bid
the
most
senior
bidder
gets
the
job
and
the
strikers
are
the
ones
who
have
been
on
the
strike,
will
of
course,
always
have
the
greater
seniority.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
no.
no,
they
would
not
be.
that's
why
i
say
there
is
no
displacement
right
but
they
have
the
right
to
bid
on
any
job
as
they
have
had
throughout
the
strike.
every
job
that
has
been
opened
by
the
florida
east
coast
has
been
advertised.
everyone
of
these
people
has
had
the
right
to
bid
on
every
job
that
we
have
reinstituted
since
the
strike
began.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
correct.
there
is
not
a
direct
bumping
procedure.
there
are
circumstances
where
this
maybe
the
result,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
it
is
not
an
automatic
bumping
procedure.
for
example,
if
a
person
has
been
off
on
an
authorized
leave
of
absence
or
has
been
sick,
when
he
returns
he
would
have
the
right
to
exercise
seniority
to
job
which
had
been
bid
during
his
absence.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
this
in
turn
would
permit
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that's
right.
there
are
other
--
there
are
other
instances
where
this
would
be
true
but
it's
not
an
across-the-board
right
to
bump.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
oh!
mr.
justice
white
really
this
is
an
exaggeration
of
what
has
happened.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
no.
every
man
who
had
been
hired
--
has
been
hired
as
an
electrician
or
he's
a
machinist
or
he's
a
car
man
what
we
have
had
to
do
is
we
have
a
car
man
but
he's
not
the
car
man
as
i
recall
as
a
four-year
apprenticeship
training
program.
now,
the
man
comes
in.
he
has
had
an
experience
or
we
start
him
out
somewhere
in
this
apprenticeship
program.
now,
he
comes
to
a
job
or
part
of
that
he
can't
do
because
he's
not
experienced,
doesn't
know
how
to
do
it,
it
maybe
that
the
man
who
is
a
machinist,
is
working
as
a
machinist
will
have
to
be
called
upon
to
do
this
five
minutes
or
this
hour
of
welding
or
whatever
the
job
is.
but
the
machinist
is
basically
hired
as
a
machinist.
he
works
as
a
machinist;
he's
paid
as
a
machinist.
the
car
man
is
hired
as
a
car
man,
he
works
as
a
car
man
and
he's
paid
as
a
car
man.
so
he's
not
hired
to
do
this
strenuous
job
that
never
existed
before.
he
really
is
doing
basically
what
always
was
done.
but
because
we
haven't
had
this
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
--
that
is
exactly
correct.
that
is
precisely
what
we
have
done
throughout.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
had
approximately,
that's
slightly
less
than
that
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
no.
i
believe
the
--
the
number
is
closer
to
970,
but
it
is
more
of
600
at
present
time.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
and
mr.
justice
clark,
this
is
correct
but
one
slight
exception.
there
is
not
as
much
as
a
passenger
business
because
during
the
interim
period
since
the
strike
began,
the
traffic
is
simply
not
there.
we
reinstituted
the
passenger
service
on
august
the
2nd,
1965
and
i
believe
in
five
months
that
it
has
been
operating,
they've
carried
approximately
4800
passengers.
this
compares
--
well
annualized
this
would
be
--
this
would
be
about
10,000
passengers
a
year
compared
to
over
450,000
passengers
a
year
in
some
of
the
prior
years.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
well,
the
--
a
few
of
them
were
involved
in
the
passenger
that
is
the
broader
passenger
business.
but
many
of
them
were
replaced,
if
you
will,
by
new
techniques
or
new
or
automation
if
you
will.
they
have
changed
the
requirement
particularly
in
the
maintenance
of
weigh
departments.
this
is
where
the
change
has
been
the
most
dramatic.
the
railroad
in
the
last
three
years
has
carried
forward
the
program
of
modernization
of
its
railroad
by
going
to
the
central
traffic
control.
it
is
currently
in
installing
welded
rail.
it
has
done
many
things
that
has
reduced
the
number
of
people
required
for
the
maintenance
of
the
railroad.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
would
not
need
as
many
people
as
we
had
in
the
past.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
you
mean
on
the
operating
crew,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
william
b.
devaney
with
the
trainmen,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
--
the
1959
rules
as
to
them
replaced
and
to
effect
on
february
25,
1964.
this
has
brought
about
a
change
insofar
as
the
distance
that
a
trainman
can
be
operated.
and
instead
of
using
three
trained
crews
from
jacksonville
to
miami
on
the
through
freight
runs,
we
now
can
use
one
crew
that
would
go
the
entire
distance.
so
that
has
changed
that
number.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
well,
the
1959
rule
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that's
correct.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
there
had
been
no
--
there
has
been
no
change
from
our
past
practice
as
far
as
the
number
of
people
and
the
crew
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
you
mean
the
engineer
and
fireman?
mr.
william
b.
devaney
on
the
engineer
and
the
--
the
fireman,
there
has
been
no
change
on
that.
we
still
use
the
same
number
of
engineers
that
we
use
prior
to
the
strike.
now,
it
is
of
course
our
position
that
once
the
strike
began,
the
agreements
were
no
longer
in
effect
and
within
the
exercise
of
self-help,
the
railway
was
free
to
utilize
the
manpower
and
means
at
it's
disposal
to
operate.
now,
the
basic
claim
of
the
government
as
we
understand
is
the
railroad
was
not
entitled
to
get
back
into
operation
except
in
strict
compliance
with
all
agreements
of
the
21
different
labor
organizations
involved.
it
is
their
position
that
the
railway
was
not
entitled
to
use
supervisors
to
operate
a
train.
now,
their
contention
really
comes
down
to
the
fact
that
if
we
had
hired
the
first
man
or
the
machinist
that
we
can
only
use
him
as
a
machinist.
and
no
matter
what
the
need
and
even
if
he
were
the
only
person
who
was
qualified
and
available
to
do
some
other
job
we
couldn't
use
him
for
that
job.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
well,
i
think
that
mr.
justice
stewart
is
correct.
i
think
the
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
and
may
i
say
that
we
have
not
--
we
have
not
attempted
to
hire
a
person
who
is
not
qualified
to
bring
him
in
and
hire
them
as
a
journeyman.
we
have
not
done
that.
the
person
must
be
qualified
if
he
is
hired
as
a
journeyman,
but
because
he's
not
a
journeyman
we
do
have
to
hire
him
somewhere
within
this
apprenticeship
training
program.
now
there
are
age
limitations
under
the
agreement,
you
can't
be
over
a
given
age
to
enter
this
program.
we
say
that
obviously
if
you
have
to
get
people,
you
have
to
get
what
you
can
and
you
put
them
in,
you
slide
them
in
based
on
their
past
experience,
where
they
belong
in
this
apprenticeship
program
and
then
you
go
forward
and
train
him
here.
now
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
felt
in
the
first
place,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
--
that
the
fallacy
of
the
district
court
in
the
first
place
was
to
tie
the
hands
of
the
carrier
by
saying
that
you
have
no
flexibility
to
meet
any
condition
that
comes
up.
you
must
come
to
the
court
and
get
prior
specific
approval
before
you
can
make
any
deviations
from
the
agreement.
what
we
said
was,
you
say
“what
did
we
want
specifically?”
there
wasn't
anything
that
we
--
we
felt
other
than
what
we
listed
in
our
petition
that
we
had
to
have.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
want
to
go
only
to
the
extent,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
if
we
are
required
to
deviate
in
some
manner
from
those
agreements
in
order
to
operate
that
we
must
have
the
right
to
do
so.
and
we
don't
feel
that
it's
reasonable
to
require
the
railroad
to
come
in
with
a
petition
and
a
hearing
and
a
prior
determination
before
you
can
meet
that
emergency.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
well,
i
think
that
it
probably
does
mean
that
but
it
does
not
mean
that
they
do
not
have
both
a
full
--
a
complete
and
an
adequate
remedy
for
what
we
have
done,
every
other
railroad
has
it.
what
the
district
court
is
doing
here
is
telling
the
florida
east
coast
during
a
strike
where
we're
faced
with
the
shortage
of
manpower
that
you
can't
do
whatever
the
other
railroad
does
as
a
matter
of
everyday
business
course.
and
that
is,
every
other
railroad
if
there
is
some
problem
that
comes
up,
it
goes
ahead
and
it
meets
that
problem.
now
if
it
is
used
to
supervisor
or
if
it's
crossed
the
craft
line
and
if
there
is
a
claim,
the
claim
goes
to
the
adjustment
board.
this
is
where
we
say
that
all
of
the
claims
belong.
and
if
there
is
--
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
right
and
if
these
agreements
are
not
suspended
then
we
say
that
these
disputes
belong
in
the
adjustment
board.
that
is
the
body
that
congress
has
created
and
it's
a
body
that
this
court
has
consistently
recognized
as
having
the
exclusive
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
your
honor
this
was
--
it
was
correct.
there
has
been
a
backlog
and
as
--
as
you
undoubtedly
notice
that
one
of
the
matters
that
is
now
before
congress
to
permit
or
to
require
other
party
to
request
the
appointment
of
special
board
who
helps
speed
up
the
decisional
process.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
not
major
change
mr.
justice
white.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
because
of
the
strike
itself
and
the
emergency
that
was
thrust
upon
the
railroad
that
we
have
a
right
of
self-help
and
try
to
operate
and
we're
saying
that
if
there
are
claims
that
we
have
not
complied
with
the
agreement
that
the
adjustment
board
is
a
proper
body
to
adjudicate
those
claims.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
but
there
aren't
changes
in
the
agreement,
mr.
justice
white.
they
don't
change
the
agreement
no
matter
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
because
if
there
is
not,
compliance
with
the
agreement
then
they
have
the
power
to
remedy
whatever
violation
has
occurred.
i
mean
look
back
--
look
back
if
you
will
at
the
decision
that
have
gone
through
the
adjustment
board
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
well
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that's
--
our
first
position
is
that
--
our
first
position
is
precisely
that
the
strike
suspends
or
creates
an
emergency
condition
whereby
these
agreements
are
not
affected
during
the
period
of
strike.
that
is
our
first
position
we
say,
but
if
we're
wrong
about
that
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
but
if
we're
wrong
about
that
then
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
telling
the
district
court
that
you
can
interpret
and
imply
these
agreements.
now,
as
far
as
the
--
as
far
as
the
suspension
of
the
agreements,
mr.
justice
white,
we
have
submitted
as
a
supplementary
reply
brief
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
eastern
airlines
case.
and
we
submitted
this
for
the
simple
reason
that
this
illustrates
very,
very
clearly
that
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that's
red
one,
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
this
illustrates
very
clearly
that
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
when
a
strike
occurs
as
it
occurred
in
the
eastern
airlines
case
something
happens
to
the
agreement.
now,
here
in
the
eastern
airlines
case,
eastern
had
an
agreement
with
the
pilots.
they
had
a
separate
agreement
with
the
flight
engineers.
they
bargained
on
a
reopening
notice
not
to
cancel
the
flight
engineer's
agreement
but
to
reopen
it,
it
doesn't
reach
the
agreement
and
in
1962
the
flight
engineers
struck.
now,
at
that
time
recall
that
they
had
the
contract
with
the
eastern
and
they
were
the
duly
designated
representative
of
the
class
or
craft
of
flight
engineers.
the
strike
occurs.
eastern
has
closed
down
for
about
a
month.
eastern
reopens
using
as
flight
engineers,
pilots
furnished
by
the
pilots
union
who's
been
qualified
as
engineers
plus
a
few
of
the
returnee
engineers
and
moreover,
it
doesn't
just
go
back
to
work
with
the
replacements.
it
then
enters
into
a
contract
without
the
pilots
union
covering
the
work
to
be
performed
by
these
replacement
engineers.
there
isn't
any
doubt
that
absent
the
strike
eastern
could
not
have
entered
into
an
agreement
with
a
different
union
covering
the
class
or
craft
which
the
flight
engineers
had
previously
represented.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
so
far
as
it's
shown,
mr.
justice
white,
they
were
--
i
don't
know.
we
know
they
were
different
to
this
extent
but
instead
of
their
being
engineers
and
having
the
--
the
license
that
the
engineers
had
they
now
have
the
license
that
pilots
have.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
correct.
that
is
exactly
correct.
and
it
did
this
because
as
the
court
--
the
southern
district
of
new
york
found
not
once
but
three
different
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
has
found
in
three
different
occasions
that
after
the
strike
began,
the
agreement
between
eastern
and
the
flight
engineers
was
no
longer
in
the
agreement.
now,
the
impact
of
that
decision
is
further
emphasized
and
underscored
by
the
decision
of
the
same
circuit
in
the
ruby
case
which
is
cited
in
their
opinion,
ruby
versus
american
airlines
which
involved
the
same,
essentially
the
same
agreement
although
it
was
with
different
airlines
between
the
flight
engineers
and
american,
and
the
agreement
between
the
pilots
and
american.
again
you
have
to
bargain.
in
the
american
case,
it
differed
a
little
bit
because
the
pilots
and
the
flight
engineers
on
american
got
together
and
they
signed
or
issued
an
agreement.
then
it
was
the
pilot's
international
union
that
it
refused
to
approve
this
agreement
that
the
american
pilots
had
negotiated.
so,
the
--
the
local
pilots
on
american
when
the
international
refused
to
go
along
with
the
package
they
had
bargained
sought
separate
representation.
well
at
this
point,
the
flight
engineers
asked
to
continue
bargaining
with
the
american.
and
american
said,
“no,
you
have
signed
this
agreement
and
have
initialed
it
merging
your
bargaining
rights
in
with
the
pilots.”
second
circuit
said
“no,
there's
no
strike
here
and
american
must
continue
to
recognize
and
bargain
with
the
flight
engineers
until
there
is
a
final
consummation
and
a
final
change
that
changes
or
wipes
out
the
bargaining
rights
with
the
flight
engineers.
so
that
there
is
no
doubt
in
our
judgment,
look
at
the
court
cases,
look
at
the
decisions
of
the
adjustment
board
itself,
the
adjustment
board
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
when
a
strike
occurs
it
creates
an
emergency
condition
that
justifies
the
carrier
in
performing
the
work
with
supervisors
or
in
whatever
way
it
can.
we
say
that
--
we
believe
the
strike
on
florida
east
coast
have
that
effect.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
yes,
we
have
mr.
justice
white.
they
are
all
cited
in
our
brief
and
are
detailed
in
some
respect
in
our
reply
brief
as
to
what
the
facts
are.
they
began
on
the
reply
brief
at
page
20
--
24
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
essentially
correct.
i
believe
that
the
cases
by
and
large
involved
a
strike
by
one
union,
another
group
who
said
“we're
not
on
strike.”
we
had
a
right
to
perform
this
work
and
it
had
been
performed
by
supervisor
or
by
somebody
else.
so
that
yes,
it
was
the
expediency
that
the
railroad
was
put
to
have
the
work
performed.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
interpretation
of
the
agreement
is
not
really
the
--
the
precise
characterization.
i
think
it
would
be
more
proper
to
say
that
it
was
an
interpretation
of
the
overall
--
of
the
implied
condition
of
all
of
these
agreements.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
correct.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
correct.
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
and
the
adjustment
board
reports
which
are
reviewed
both
in
our
reply
brief
and
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
association
of
american
railroads
strikes
over
a
period,
i
believe
1955
are
reviewed
in
some
detail
as
well
as
the
early
history
of
carriers
who've
operated
during
the
strikes.
but
all
of
them
have
done
essentially
what
the
florida
east
coast
has
done.
you
use
your
supervisors
to
get
off
the
ground.
you
use
some
other
volunteers
that
these
people
who
are
performing
jobs
out
of
their
regular
class
or
craft
where
they
can
do
other
jobs
and
you
hire
replacements
and
you
train
them
as
quickly
as
you
can.
now,
most
of
the
strikes
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
railroad
industry,
in
recent
years
have
been
of
relevantly
short
duration.
it
was
conceded
that
the
florida
east
coast
strike
is
unusual
in
that
regard.
it
is
longer,
and
has
been
longer
than
i
believe
any
other
strike
in
the
railroad
industry
has
been.
so
that
that
is
a
--
that
is
a
difference.
now,
prior
to
the
florida
east
coast
strike,
one
of
the
most
severe
nationwide
strikes
was
the
1922
shop
craft
strike.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
1922
which
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
1922.
now
this
was
a
nationwide
strike.
and
during
the
shop
craft
strike
of
1922,
the
--
it
had
a
very,
very
serious
impact
on
the
economy
of
the
country.
there's
no
question
about
it.
but
during
this
strike
many,
many
of
the
carriers
as
the
ar
has
pointed
out
in
their
reply
brief
provided
some
level
of
service.
again,
in
1946
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
no.
the
railroad
--
the
railway
labor
act
was
not
passed
until
1926
mr.
chief
justice,
four
years
later.
now,
we
do
say,
and
i
think
that
it
might
be
appropriate
at
this
point
to
simply
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
railway
labor
act
was
passed
in
1926,
four
years
after
the
beginning
of
this
nationwide
strike.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
congress
had
this
specially
in
mind.
it
had
the
clearest
example
of
a
paralysis
of
the
entire
railroad
transportation
industry
and
the
fact
that
carriers
did
provide
service
during
the
period
of
strike
and
yet
in
the
railway
labor
act
which
had
passed
in
1926
although
it
puts
status
quo
provisions
at
various
points
before
he
reached
the
right
to
strike,
there
it's
not
one
word
in
the
legislative
history,
there
isn't
one
word
in
the
statute
that
indicates
that
congress
did
intended
to
or
had
any
intention
of
placing
any
limitation
on
the
right
of
self-help
once
the
strike
began.
everything
in
the
railway
labor
act
was
designed
to
try
to
prevent
strikes,
but
if
it
did
not
succeed
in
preventing
strikes
then
the
parties
will
allow
the
self-help
to
resolve
it
--
their
differences.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
oh
yes.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
well,
one
that
comes
to
mind
immediately
mr.
chief
justice
was
the
nationwide
strike
which
was
called
in
1946
by
the
engineers
and
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
now,
this
was
unusual
in
one
respect
in
that
there
had
been
an
initial
strike
date
set
and
in
anticipation
of
this
original
strike
date,
the
president
of
the
united
states
seized
all
of
the
railroads
in
the
country
under
a
statute
which
was
then
in
effect.
the
original
strike
was
postponed.
so
that
when
the
strike
actually
took
place
in
1946,
the
government
was
under
control
of
the
railroads
and
the
strike
was
in
effect
against
the
united
states.
now,
not
only
did
the
carrier
after
carrier
and
we
did
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief
a
reference
to
the
survey
in
the
railway
age
of
the
different
railroads
that
provided
service
during
this
period
of
strike.
i
believe
this
strike
lasted
only
two
days
but
it
was
nationwide
in
a
great
significance
to
the
economy
of
the
country.
now,
not
only
did
many
of
the
railroads
try
to
operate
by
using
supervisors,
but
it
was
done
at
the
behest
of
and
with
the
complete
knowledge
of
the
united
states
itself.
then
there
was
the
strike
on
the
lan
which
lasted
47
or
48
days.
i
believe
that
was
in
1955.
there
had
been
other
strikes
on
airlines
as
well
as
carriers.
the
numbers
of
strikes
are
again
detailed
in
the
reply
brief
of
both
the
association
of
american
railroads
and
our
reply
brief.
the
30th
annual
report
of
the
mediation
board
for
1963
and
1964
for
example
refers
to
the
eastern
airlines
strike
which
began
june
23,
1962,
flight
operations
were
resumed
in
september
of
1962,
and
the
strike
on
the
florida
east
coast
which
began
january
23,
1963.
the
54-55
annual
report
refers
to
the
lan
strike.
in
each
of
these,
the
mediation
board
simply
reports
that
these
carriers
resumed
service
or
maintained
service
during
the
period
of
a
strike.
the
most
recent
strike
what
i
recall
referred
to
in
the
--
the
ar
--
initial
brief
is
the
houston
terminal
authority.
this
lasted
well
over
a
month,
i
forgot
the
precise
number
of
days,
but
its
well
over
a
month.
and
again
they
operated
throughout
the
period
of
the
strike
by
using
supervisors
and
by
hiring
replacements.
now
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
oh!
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
we
recognized
that
each
one
of
these
unions
continue
to
represent
the
employees
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
all
of
them
--
all
of
--
we
haven't
--we
have
never
set
the
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
no.
we
don't
say
that
mr.
justice
white.
we
say
that
these
--
these
emergency
conditions
that
we
have
to
resort
to
that
this
is
a
matter
of
self-help
as
a
matter
of
right
of
the
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
now
on
everything
else
we
say
he
has
the
--
he
has
a
positive
and
absolute
duty
to
bargain
with
the
union.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that's
true
mr.
justice
brennan
but
consider
the
--
consider
the
impossibility
of
going
forward
on
the
basis
of
bargaining
about
these
emergency
changes
or
the
apprenticeship
program.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
that
it
is
perfectly
correct
as
has
been
suggested
that
the
union
who
calls
a
strike
is
not
going
to
agree
to
a
weight
for
us
to
beat
the
strike.
but
if
they
did
how
long,
how
long
would
it
take?
the
1959
rules
dispute
which
was
before
this
court
in
the
p&o
case
started
in
1959
and
the
decision
of
this
court
wasn't
until
1963.
so
if
it's
a
year
--
if
we
--
if
we
exceed
all
speed
records
for
having
a
dispute
under
the
--
the
railway
labor
act
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
you
could
not
bargain,
and
you
could
not
negotiate,
and
could
not
complete
the
procedures
of
the
act
in
order
to
--
to
resume
the
operation
of
railroad
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time
in
the
future.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
you
would
continue,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
believe
that
they
would
have
the
right
to
file
any
grievance
that
they
might
desire
to
file.
now,
if
that
involved
a
condition
which
the
railroad
--
railway
had
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
well
yes,
there
is
a
procedure
for
that.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
no.
if
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
for
--
for
a
very
long
period
of
time,
mr.
justice
white,
the
unions
were
not
processing
grievances
on
behalf
of
replacements.
in
more
recent
months
that
they
have
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
i
do
not
know
the
answer,
mr.
justice
white
where
a
replacement
has
asked
the
union
to
handle
his
case
and
it
had
been
rejected.
i
can
only
say
that
in
the
beginning
they
were
not
presenting
any
grievances
on
behalf
of
the
replacements.
in
more
recent
months
they
have
been.
some
of
the
unions
have
been,
not
all
of
them
but
some
of
the
unions
have
in
more
recent
months
been
presenting
grievances
in
representing
the
replacements.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
this
was
a
--
we
felt
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
well,
this
was
a
--
we
ask
as
one
of
the
--
we
ask
as
one
of
the
--
the
conditions
of
the
district
court
that
the
district
court
say
that
the
union
shop
provision
was
not
enforceable
unless
and
until
such
time
his
membership
was
offered
to
the
replacements.
now,
we
weren't
saying
--
we
weren't
saying
casted
out,
we
were
saying
here
is
the
history
of
the
discrimination
from
the
day
the
strike
began.
if
you
or
your
former
members
who
came
back
to
work,
you
have
five,
you
are
cast
out
of
the
union,
the
replacements
who
have
applied
for
membership
not
one
of
them,
not
one
person
has
ever
been
taken
into
the
union.
now,
we
say
that
the
--
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
trainmen
case
because
the
same
issue
was
raised
there
and
when
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
corollary
to
the
right
of
the
union
to
strike
was
we
had
the
right
to
operate
and
we
have
--
it
was
not
a
violation
to
hire
replacements,
so
we
had
no
duty
to
discharge
unless
or
until
membership
that
was
offered
to
them
without
discrimination.
we
said
to
the
district
court
that
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
meant
that
if
these
people
were
being
discriminated
against
that
they
shouldn't
be
subject
to
discharge
until
membership
was
offered
to
them.
the
district
court
did
not
agree
with
this
and
it
did
not
contain
this
provision
and
to
that
extent
you
are
correct.
we
did
take
the
position
that
if
these
people
have
to
be
subject
to
the
union
shop
agreement
that
it
should
be
subject
to
the
union
making
membership
available
and
if
it
isn't
willing
to
do
that,
then
the
agreement
as
to
that
should
not
be
enforceable
during
the
period
of
the
strike.
now
if
i
may
refer
to
one
last
matter
which
the
unions
have
raised,
it
is
this
question
of
the
toledo,
p.
&
w.r.
and
eastern
case.
now,
we
believe
that
this
has
no
application
for
any
purpose.
to
begin
with
we
have
not
asked
for
any
equitable
relief.
it's
our
position
that
the
right
of
self-help
is
a
legal
right
that
this
all
we
have
asked
for
as
all
we
feel
we're
entitled
to.
but
second,
the
toledo,
p
&
w.r.
case
itself
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
court
in
that
decision
was
confronted
with
a
situation
where
the
carrier
had
refused
arbitration
prior
to
the
strike.
now,
the
exchange
of
correspondence
is
set
forth
in
appendix
a
of
our
reply
brief.
it
clearly
shows
that
florida
east
coast
before
the
strike
simply
said
that
we
believe
your
offer
of
arbitration
is
premature
that
there
should
be
further
mediation.
the
union
came
back
and
said,
“we
don't
--
we
reject
the
suggestion
of
mediation.
we
reject
arbitration.”
at
that
point,
the
board
listened
to
the
dispute.
later
florida
east
coast
even
said,
“well
--
to
the
mediation
board,
we
believe
that
there
should
be
an
emergency
already
created.
there
was
no
such
recommendation
and
the
strike
began.
now,
toledo
says,
as
i
read
the
case
clearly
and
without
any
provocation
that
it
applies
only
where
the
procedures
of
railway
labor
act
including
the
proffer
of
arbitration
has
been
rejected.
there
was
no
rejection
prior
to
the
strike
which
are
the
procedures
of
railway
labor
act
by
the
carrier.
it
was
a
rejection
by
the
unions
of
arbitration.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
offer
of
secretary
of
labor
were
some
four
months
after
the
strike
began
to
help
--
to
bring
about
a
settlement
means
that
even
if
equitable
relief
were
asked
for
that
the
refusal
four
months
after
the
strike
had
began
and
after
we
got
back
into
operation
it
meant
that
we
have
not
made
use
of
the
procedures
of
the
act.
so
that
we
say
that
the
--
that
the
argument
really
has
no
application
to
this
case.
we
believe
that
--
that
however
it's
construed
that
it
would
not
be
applicable
by
way
of
limitation
on
anything
that
florida
east
coast
has
done.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may
at
the
outset
apply
immediately
to
the
question
that
mr.
bender
has
raised
at
the
very
end
of
his
argument
namely,
the
fact
that
florida
east
coast
has
not
raised
the
right
to
use
supervisors
and
to
otherwise
operate
with
the
employees
if
it
had
available
and
we
have
not
challenged
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
make
these
determinations.
i
would
like
only
to
refer
to
our
petition
--
cross-petition
for
certiorari.
on
page
30,
this
is
question
number
2.
on
page
32,
of
our
initial
brief
and
on
page
36
of
our
reply
brief,
i
believe
it's
very
clear
that
we
have
said
consistently
all
the
way
through
this
proceeding
that
that
is
the
position
that
we
have
taken.
now,
before
getting
into
the
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
this
is
the
position
that
mr.
.bender
suggested
that
there
might
be
things
such
as
the
use
of
supervisors
that
we
could
do
and
that
we
didn't
raise
the
question
and
that
if
the
unions
had
been
asked
about
it
and
there
the
disagreement
it
would
go
to
the
adjustment
board.
now,
we
have
raised
that
consistently
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
said
that
what
the
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
oh,
i
did.
i
did,
mr.
justice
brennan.
on
page
3
of
our
petition
that
is
question
number
2
which
concerns
directly
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
to
determine
the
questions
of
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
agreement
and
we
argued
the
same
points
at
page
32
of
our
initial
brief
and
36
of
our
reply
brief.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
there
is
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
did
not.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
did
not
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
--
we
didn't
raise
it
with
the
unions,
mr.
chief
justice
and
they
didn't
raise
it
with
us.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that's
correct.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
never
contended
or
asserted
the
right
to
do
anything
except
what
was
necessary
under
the
strike
conditions
in
order
to
operate
the
railroad.
that's
all
we
have
insisted
that
we
have
the
right
to
do.
and
when
the
strike
began
we
had
absolutely
no
employees,
but
supervisors
and
when
we
operated
the
first
train
on
february
the
3rd,
we
used
supervisors
because
this
was
the
only
way
we
could
operate
and
in
using
the
supervisors
we
clearly
crossed
every
craft
line
imaginable.
we
had
to
run
them
through
terminals.
we
have
to
have
them
do
the
yard
work,
local
freight
work,
inspect
their
own
locomotives,
they
fueled
their
own
diesels,
they
did
everything
that
was
required
to
be
done,
because
there
was
not
anybody
else
who
could
do
this
work
for
the
railroad.
as
we
began
to
hire
replacements,
in
the
first
place
when
it
wasn't
hired
until
more
than
a
month
after
we
ran
the
first
train,
it
was
in
april
and
we
hired
one
man
in
april.
now,
with
one
man
we
have
to
use
his
skills
and
ability
to
do
whatever
he
could
do.
it
is
conceded
all
the
way
through
that
we
could
not
hire
qualified
employees.
they
were
basically
unqualified
and
we
have
to
train
them.
it
was
earlier
asked
about
training
time
well,
in
shop
class
alone,
there
is
a
four-year
apprenticeship
program
which
is
required.
we
couldn't
get
the
journeymen
and
to
train
these
people
under
the
agreements
themselves
would
take
a
period
of
four
years.
so
we
have
no
alternative
but
to
hire
people
with
as
much
skill
as
we
could
find
and
we
have
to
use
those
skills
the
best
way
we
could.
and
if
the
men
were
not
fully
qualified
to
perform
the
work
of
machinist,
he
had
to
do
whatever
part
of
that
job
he
could
do
and
we
have
something
else
that
somebody
else
could
do.
we
have
to
use
another
person
to
try
and
fill
in
and
do
the
job
and
to
keep
the
railroad
operating.
that's
what
we
did.
it
was
asked
earlier
to
what
we
do
about
payment
well,
there's
no
question
about
this.
when
the
strike
replacement
problem
first
came
up
in
april,
the
only
way
we
could
get
replacements
was
to
pay
them
on
a
salary
basis.
i
think
it's
perfectly
understandable
why
they
might
have
wanted
a
salary.
they
didn't
know
and
the
railroad
didn't
know
whether
we
could
operate
this
railroad
one
day
or
two
days
or
a
week
or
whether
it
would
be
successful
but
he
wanted
a
salary.
the
record
shows
that
we
took
the
hourly
rates
in
the
contract,
we
converted
them
to
a
salary,
that's
what
we
did.
in
addition
to
that
we
did
because
of
severe
shortage
of
clerical
employees.
we
did
take
the
holiday
pay
provisions
and
included
that
in
these
base
rates.
every
one
of
the
agreements
had
a
different
eligibility
provision.
and
we
just
didn't
have
the
personnel
to
keep
all
the
records
required
so
we
put
it
all
into
the
base
rate.
now,
except
for
those
changes,
this
is
what
the
people
were
paying
and
as
early
as
april,
when
we
were
beginning
to
get
a
few
more
replacement
employees,
we
started
moving
back
to
the
hourly
base,
the
hourly
rate.
now
what
we
have
to
do,
and
we
don't
deny,
it
is
perfectly
clear
in
the
record
that
we
had
no
choice
but
to
use
the
people
to
perform
whatever
job
they
could
do.
you
didn't
have
journeyman
machinist,
you
didn't
have
journeyman
electricians.
and
if
we
had
a
man
who
had
been
an
automobile
mechanic,
he'd
done
some
welding
before
he
might
be
working
for
us
as
an
electrician.
but
if
we
needed
the
welding,
we
have
to
use
that
man
to
do
the
welding
if
he
was
the
only
person
available
to
do
it.
this
is
what
we
did.
this
is
what
we
say
we
have
a
right
to
do.
we
say
this
is
what
self-help
means
and
that
is
what
this
case
was
all
about.
really,
the
issue
is,
as
mr.
bender
has
stated,
it's
a
narrow
one.
it's
whether
a
rail
or
an
air
carrier
has
the
right
to
try
to
operate
in
the
face
of
a
strike
with
whatever
personnel
it
has
available
and
it
is
our
position
that
a
carrier
does
have
that
right.
we
say
that
this
is
precisely
what
self-help
means.
it's
what
this
court
and
many
other
courts
have
said
happens
when
procedures
of
the
act
are
exhausted
and
not
only
that
this
court
say
that
the
right,
that
both
parties
have
this
right
of
self-help
but
it's
the
only
right
and
the
only
means
to
adjust
the
dispute
once
the
procedure
of
the
act
are
exhausted.
now,
looking
at
it
in
point
of
time
we
have
seen
that
the
railway
had
no
employees
except
a
handful
of
supervisors
who
were
capable
of
doing
the
various
work
that
was
required.
we
had
to
use
those
people.
we
had
no
choice
whatever.
from
a
workforce
of
2,000,
in
one
day
our
workforce
was
zero.
there
was
no
alternative
on
the
part
of
the
railroad,
but
to
use
such
people
as
we
had
available
and
such
skills
as
they
possessed.
now,
the
government
--
now,
the
union
has
ever
contested
the
complete
impossibility
of
hiring
and
training
the
necessary
replacements.
it
is
conceded
by
all
parties,
that
at
the
time
the
strike
began
and
for
a
very
substantial
period
thereafter
we
couldn't
have
operated
one
train
in
compliance
with
any
of
the
agreements,
not
one
train.
in
fact
the
record
is
clear
and
uncontradicted.
now,
we
could
never
have
got
back
in
service
without
using
supervisors.
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
only
way
we
could
train
these
people
was
by
on
the
--
was
with
on-job-training
and
the
only
way
you
can
give
a
person
on-the-job-training
is
to
operate,
no
other
alternative.
we
had
no
choice
but
to
do
that.
now,
in
operating
with
supervisors
using
the
skills
available,
we
concede
that
this
was
not
in
accordance
with
the
agreements,
but
in
doing
this
we
were
following
of
practice
that
every
railroad
in
the
country
has
followed
for
at
least
40
years
when
it's
faced
with
a
strike
or
some
other
emergency
situation.
now
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
say
that
the
agreement
is
there.
we
say
in
the
first
place
that
wheel
doesn't
change
it's
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
it's
--
we
say
suspended.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
none
whatever
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
--
we
do
not
question
that.
they
clearly
have
that
duty,
very
--
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
well,
your
honor
the
--
at
anytime
the
strike
is
settled,
the
agreements
then
become
full
blown,
fully
applicable
and
must
without
question
be
complied
with
in
every
respect.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
precisely
our
position
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
your
honor
at
any
time,
let
us
take
the
strike
which
began
strictly
as
a
wage
dispute.
now,
just
for
clarity
so
that
they'll
understand
the
possession
of
a
railroad,
the
florida
east
coast
was
not
a
party
to
the
national
handling.
and
the
earlier
recommendation
of
10.28
cents
was
made
by
the
board
before
which
the
florida
east
coast
didn't
appear,
didn't
participate
in
anyway.
we
weren't
parties
to
that
national
bargaining.
now,
when
they
did
go
on
strike
the
issue
at
that
point
was
at
10.28
cents
per
hour.
now,
if
we
had
settled
and
been
to
settle
that
dispute
and
again
let
me
say
the
bargaining
continued
in
1963
on
that
dispute
and
it
has
continued
since
that
time.
there's
been
no
failure,
no
allegation
that
there's
ever
been
any
failure
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
to
bargain
in
good
faith
and
to
fulfill
this
obligation.
but
had
we
settled,
certainly
had
we
settled
before
the
replacement
issue
came
into
being
at
all,
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
would
have
settled
the
entire
dispute.
the
temporary
practices
that
were
--
that
we
had
to
follow
in
that
immediately
upon
the
cessation
of
the
strike.
they
had
no
permanents
at
all.
they
were
not
changes
in
agreements.
they
had
in
no
effect
whatever
on
the
agreements
that
existed
with
these
judgments.
we
have
never
denied,
we've
never
taken
a
position
that
in
an
agreement
can
be
changed
in
anyway.
that
is
a
permanent
agreement
can
be
change
as
in
anyway
except
going
through
all
the
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
oh
yes,
indeed
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
would
have
the
right,
mr.
chief
justice
to
give
a
notice
at
anytime
and
to
proceed
to
negotiate
about
changes,
but
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
--
it
would
not
have
any
effect
until
you've
gone
through
all
the
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act
on
that
notice.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
would
be
no
such
right.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
question
of
the
replacement
is
simply
this.
on
the
florida
east
coast,
they
have
no
--
they
have
no
super
seniority,
that
question
had
never
been
present.
they
were
employed
contrary
what
mr.
bender
may
have
implied.
they
were
employed
in
accordance
with
the
agreement
as
far
as
their
seniority,
their
date
of
hire,
and
so
forth
is
concerned.
they
have
no
special
protection.
the
only
thing
that
they
are
not
subject
to
having
done
to
them
is
to
being
pushed
out
just
automatically
because
the
strikers
would
not
have
an
absolute
right
of
displacement.
over
a
period
of
time,
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
yes,
they
do
gradually
displace.
every
time
a
job
changes,
there's
a
vacancy,
a
promotion,
anything
that
occurs
that
you
have
to
re-advertise
under
the
agreements
that
the
vacant
job,
it
is
bid
on
by
everybody
who
has
seniority.
now
the
strikers
have
continued
to
earn
seniority
during
the
whole
period
that
they'd
been
on
the
strike.
so
that
--
that
no
matter
how
junior
they
may
have
been
before
the
strike
every
one
of
the
strikers
will
always
have
more
seniority
than
the
replacements,
but
it
will
have
to
be
on
a
bidding
basis
not
an
automatic
displacement
right.
they
do
not
have
that.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
this
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
yes,
but
that
is
a
subject
for
bargaining
and
there
has
been
some
bargaining
about
this
variation.
it
certainly
is
a
question
about
which
the
parties
not
only
are
afraid
to
bargain,
but
i
think
the
duty
to
bargain
would
require
that
they
both
sit
down
and
talk
about
that
in
the
same
manner
that
they
would
in
the
other
proposal.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
it
has
proved
to
be
so
up
to
this
point
that
it
is
quite
good.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
there
has
been
no
notice,
no
separate
notice
given
by
the
unions
concerning
this
right
because
again
like
some
of
the
other
cases
in
which
super
seniority
has
been
involved,
they
have
all
the
seniority.
it
merely
is
a
question
of
their
waiting
until
they
have
the
right
and
do
bid
on
the
job.
i
mean,
jobs
are
bid
daily.
so
that
over
a
period
of
time,
yes,
every
time
a
job
is
bid
the
most
senior
bidder
gets
the
job
and
the
strikers
are
the
ones
who
have
been
on
the
strike,
will
of
course,
always
have
the
greater
seniority.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
no.
no,
they
would
not
be.
that's
why
i
say
there
is
no
displacement
right
but
they
have
the
right
to
bid
on
any
job
as
they
have
had
throughout
the
strike.
every
job
that
has
been
opened
by
the
florida
east
coast
has
been
advertised.
everyone
of
these
people
has
had
the
right
to
bid
on
every
job
that
we
have
reinstituted
since
the
strike
began.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
correct.
there
is
not
a
direct
bumping
procedure.
there
are
circumstances
where
this
maybe
the
result,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
it
is
not
an
automatic
bumping
procedure.
for
example,
if
a
person
has
been
off
on
an
authorized
leave
of
absence
or
has
been
sick,
when
he
returns
he
would
have
the
right
to
exercise
seniority
to
job
which
had
been
bid
during
his
absence.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
this
in
turn
would
permit
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that's
right.
there
are
other
--
there
are
other
instances
where
this
would
be
true
but
it's
not
an
across-the-board
right
to
bump.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
oh!
mr.
justice
white
really
this
is
an
exaggeration
of
what
has
happened.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
no.
every
man
who
had
been
hired
--
has
been
hired
as
an
electrician
or
he's
a
machinist
or
he's
a
car
man
what
we
have
had
to
do
is
we
have
a
car
man
but
he's
not
the
car
man
as
i
recall
as
a
four-year
apprenticeship
training
program.
now,
the
man
comes
in.
he
has
had
an
experience
or
we
start
him
out
somewhere
in
this
apprenticeship
program.
now,
he
comes
to
a
job
or
part
of
that
he
can't
do
because
he's
not
experienced,
doesn't
know
how
to
do
it,
it
maybe
that
the
man
who
is
a
machinist,
is
working
as
a
machinist
will
have
to
be
called
upon
to
do
this
five
minutes
or
this
hour
of
welding
or
whatever
the
job
is.
but
the
machinist
is
basically
hired
as
a
machinist.
he
works
as
a
machinist;
he's
paid
as
a
machinist.
the
car
man
is
hired
as
a
car
man,
he
works
as
a
car
man
and
he's
paid
as
a
car
man.
so
he's
not
hired
to
do
this
strenuous
job
that
never
existed
before.
he
really
is
doing
basically
what
always
was
done.
but
because
we
haven't
had
this
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
--
that
is
exactly
correct.
that
is
precisely
what
we
have
done
throughout.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
had
approximately,
that's
slightly
less
than
that
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
no.
i
believe
the
--
the
number
is
closer
to
970,
but
it
is
more
of
600
at
present
time.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
and
mr.
justice
clark,
this
is
correct
but
one
slight
exception.
there
is
not
as
much
as
a
passenger
business
because
during
the
interim
period
since
the
strike
began,
the
traffic
is
simply
not
there.
we
reinstituted
the
passenger
service
on
august
the
2nd,
1965
and
i
believe
in
five
months
that
it
has
been
operating,
they've
carried
approximately
4800
passengers.
this
compares
--
well
annualized
this
would
be
--
this
would
be
about
10,000
passengers
a
year
compared
to
over
450,000
passengers
a
year
in
some
of
the
prior
years.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
well,
the
--
a
few
of
them
were
involved
in
the
passenger
that
is
the
broader
passenger
business.
but
many
of
them
were
replaced,
if
you
will,
by
new
techniques
or
new
or
automation
if
you
will.
they
have
changed
the
requirement
particularly
in
the
maintenance
of
weigh
departments.
this
is
where
the
change
has
been
the
most
dramatic.
the
railroad
in
the
last
three
years
has
carried
forward
the
program
of
modernization
of
its
railroad
by
going
to
the
central
traffic
control.
it
is
currently
in
installing
welded
rail.
it
has
done
many
things
that
has
reduced
the
number
of
people
required
for
the
maintenance
of
the
railroad.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
would
not
need
as
many
people
as
we
had
in
the
past.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
you
mean
on
the
operating
crew,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
william
b.
devaney
with
the
trainmen,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
--
the
1959
rules
as
to
them
replaced
and
to
effect
on
february
25,
1964.
this
has
brought
about
a
change
insofar
as
the
distance
that
a
trainman
can
be
operated.
and
instead
of
using
three
trained
crews
from
jacksonville
to
miami
on
the
through
freight
runs,
we
now
can
use
one
crew
that
would
go
the
entire
distance.
so
that
has
changed
that
number.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
well,
the
1959
rule
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that's
correct.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
there
had
been
no
--
there
has
been
no
change
from
our
past
practice
as
far
as
the
number
of
people
and
the
crew
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
you
mean
the
engineer
and
fireman?
mr.
william
b.
devaney
on
the
engineer
and
the
--
the
fireman,
there
has
been
no
change
on
that.
we
still
use
the
same
number
of
engineers
that
we
use
prior
to
the
strike.
now,
it
is
of
course
our
position
that
once
the
strike
began,
the
agreements
were
no
longer
in
effect
and
within
the
exercise
of
self-help,
the
railway
was
free
to
utilize
the
manpower
and
means
at
it's
disposal
to
operate.
now,
the
basic
claim
of
the
government
as
we
understand
is
the
railroad
was
not
entitled
to
get
back
into
operation
except
in
strict
compliance
with
all
agreements
of
the
21
different
labor
organizations
involved.
it
is
their
position
that
the
railway
was
not
entitled
to
use
supervisors
to
operate
a
train.
now,
their
contention
really
comes
down
to
the
fact
that
if
we
had
hired
the
first
man
or
the
machinist
that
we
can
only
use
him
as
a
machinist.
and
no
matter
what
the
need
and
even
if
he
were
the
only
person
who
was
qualified
and
available
to
do
some
other
job
we
couldn't
use
him
for
that
job.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
well,
i
think
that
mr.
justice
stewart
is
correct.
i
think
the
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
and
may
i
say
that
we
have
not
--
we
have
not
attempted
to
hire
a
person
who
is
not
qualified
to
bring
him
in
and
hire
them
as
a
journeyman.
we
have
not
done
that.
the
person
must
be
qualified
if
he
is
hired
as
a
journeyman,
but
because
he's
not
a
journeyman
we
do
have
to
hire
him
somewhere
within
this
apprenticeship
training
program.
now
there
are
age
limitations
under
the
agreement,
you
can't
be
over
a
given
age
to
enter
this
program.
we
say
that
obviously
if
you
have
to
get
people,
you
have
to
get
what
you
can
and
you
put
them
in,
you
slide
them
in
based
on
their
past
experience,
where
they
belong
in
this
apprenticeship
program
and
then
you
go
forward
and
train
him
here.
now
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
felt
in
the
first
place,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
the
--
that
the
fallacy
of
the
district
court
in
the
first
place
was
to
tie
the
hands
of
the
carrier
by
saying
that
you
have
no
flexibility
to
meet
any
condition
that
comes
up.
you
must
come
to
the
court
and
get
prior
specific
approval
before
you
can
make
any
deviations
from
the
agreement.
what
we
said
was,
you
say
“what
did
we
want
specifically?”
there
wasn't
anything
that
we
--
we
felt
other
than
what
we
listed
in
our
petition
that
we
had
to
have.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
want
to
go
only
to
the
extent,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
if
we
are
required
to
deviate
in
some
manner
from
those
agreements
in
order
to
operate
that
we
must
have
the
right
to
do
so.
and
we
don't
feel
that
it's
reasonable
to
require
the
railroad
to
come
in
with
a
petition
and
a
hearing
and
a
prior
determination
before
you
can
meet
that
emergency.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
well,
i
think
that
it
probably
does
mean
that
but
it
does
not
mean
that
they
do
not
have
both
a
full
--
a
complete
and
an
adequate
remedy
for
what
we
have
done,
every
other
railroad
has
it.
what
the
district
court
is
doing
here
is
telling
the
florida
east
coast
during
a
strike
where
we're
faced
with
the
shortage
of
manpower
that
you
can't
do
whatever
the
other
railroad
does
as
a
matter
of
everyday
business
course.
and
that
is,
every
other
railroad
if
there
is
some
problem
that
comes
up,
it
goes
ahead
and
it
meets
that
problem.
now
if
it
is
used
to
supervisor
or
if
it's
crossed
the
craft
line
and
if
there
is
a
claim,
the
claim
goes
to
the
adjustment
board.
this
is
where
we
say
that
all
of
the
claims
belong.
and
if
there
is
--
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
right
and
if
these
agreements
are
not
suspended
then
we
say
that
these
disputes
belong
in
the
adjustment
board.
that
is
the
body
that
congress
has
created
and
it's
a
body
that
this
court
has
consistently
recognized
as
having
the
exclusive
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
your
honor
this
was
--
it
was
correct.
there
has
been
a
backlog
and
as
--
as
you
undoubtedly
notice
that
one
of
the
matters
that
is
now
before
congress
to
permit
or
to
require
other
party
to
request
the
appointment
of
special
board
who
helps
speed
up
the
decisional
process.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
not
major
change
mr.
justice
white.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
because
of
the
strike
itself
and
the
emergency
that
was
thrust
upon
the
railroad
that
we
have
a
right
of
self-help
and
try
to
operate
and
we're
saying
that
if
there
are
claims
that
we
have
not
complied
with
the
agreement
that
the
adjustment
board
is
a
proper
body
to
adjudicate
those
claims.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
but
there
aren't
changes
in
the
agreement,
mr.
justice
white.
they
don't
change
the
agreement
no
matter
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
because
if
there
is
not,
compliance
with
the
agreement
then
they
have
the
power
to
remedy
whatever
violation
has
occurred.
i
mean
look
back
--
look
back
if
you
will
at
the
decision
that
have
gone
through
the
adjustment
board
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
well
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that's
--
our
first
position
is
that
--
our
first
position
is
precisely
that
the
strike
suspends
or
creates
an
emergency
condition
whereby
these
agreements
are
not
affected
during
the
period
of
strike.
that
is
our
first
position
we
say,
but
if
we're
wrong
about
that
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
but
if
we're
wrong
about
that
then
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
telling
the
district
court
that
you
can
interpret
and
imply
these
agreements.
now,
as
far
as
the
--
as
far
as
the
suspension
of
the
agreements,
mr.
justice
white,
we
have
submitted
as
a
supplementary
reply
brief
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
eastern
airlines
case.
and
we
submitted
this
for
the
simple
reason
that
this
illustrates
very,
very
clearly
that
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that's
red
one,
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
this
illustrates
very
clearly
that
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
when
a
strike
occurs
as
it
occurred
in
the
eastern
airlines
case
something
happens
to
the
agreement.
now,
here
in
the
eastern
airlines
case,
eastern
had
an
agreement
with
the
pilots.
they
had
a
separate
agreement
with
the
flight
engineers.
they
bargained
on
a
reopening
notice
not
to
cancel
the
flight
engineer's
agreement
but
to
reopen
it,
it
doesn't
reach
the
agreement
and
in
1962
the
flight
engineers
struck.
now,
at
that
time
recall
that
they
had
the
contract
with
the
eastern
and
they
were
the
duly
designated
representative
of
the
class
or
craft
of
flight
engineers.
the
strike
occurs.
eastern
has
closed
down
for
about
a
month.
eastern
reopens
using
as
flight
engineers,
pilots
furnished
by
the
pilots
union
who's
been
qualified
as
engineers
plus
a
few
of
the
returnee
engineers
and
moreover,
it
doesn't
just
go
back
to
work
with
the
replacements.
it
then
enters
into
a
contract
without
the
pilots
union
covering
the
work
to
be
performed
by
these
replacement
engineers.
there
isn't
any
doubt
that
absent
the
strike
eastern
could
not
have
entered
into
an
agreement
with
a
different
union
covering
the
class
or
craft
which
the
flight
engineers
had
previously
represented.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
so
far
as
it's
shown,
mr.
justice
white,
they
were
--
i
don't
know.
we
know
they
were
different
to
this
extent
but
instead
of
their
being
engineers
and
having
the
--
the
license
that
the
engineers
had
they
now
have
the
license
that
pilots
have.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
correct.
that
is
exactly
correct.
and
it
did
this
because
as
the
court
--
the
southern
district
of
new
york
found
not
once
but
three
different
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
has
found
in
three
different
occasions
that
after
the
strike
began,
the
agreement
between
eastern
and
the
flight
engineers
was
no
longer
in
the
agreement.
now,
the
impact
of
that
decision
is
further
emphasized
and
underscored
by
the
decision
of
the
same
circuit
in
the
ruby
case
which
is
cited
in
their
opinion,
ruby
versus
american
airlines
which
involved
the
same,
essentially
the
same
agreement
although
it
was
with
different
airlines
between
the
flight
engineers
and
american,
and
the
agreement
between
the
pilots
and
american.
again
you
have
to
bargain.
in
the
american
case,
it
differed
a
little
bit
because
the
pilots
and
the
flight
engineers
on
american
got
together
and
they
signed
or
issued
an
agreement.
then
it
was
the
pilot's
international
union
that
it
refused
to
approve
this
agreement
that
the
american
pilots
had
negotiated.
so,
the
--
the
local
pilots
on
american
when
the
international
refused
to
go
along
with
the
package
they
had
bargained
sought
separate
representation.
well
at
this
point,
the
flight
engineers
asked
to
continue
bargaining
with
the
american.
and
american
said,
“no,
you
have
signed
this
agreement
and
have
initialed
it
merging
your
bargaining
rights
in
with
the
pilots.”
second
circuit
said
“no,
there's
no
strike
here
and
american
must
continue
to
recognize
and
bargain
with
the
flight
engineers
until
there
is
a
final
consummation
and
a
final
change
that
changes
or
wipes
out
the
bargaining
rights
with
the
flight
engineers.
so
that
there
is
no
doubt
in
our
judgment,
look
at
the
court
cases,
look
at
the
decisions
of
the
adjustment
board
itself,
the
adjustment
board
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
when
a
strike
occurs
it
creates
an
emergency
condition
that
justifies
the
carrier
in
performing
the
work
with
supervisors
or
in
whatever
way
it
can.
we
say
that
--
we
believe
the
strike
on
florida
east
coast
have
that
effect.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
yes,
we
have
mr.
justice
white.
they
are
all
cited
in
our
brief
and
are
detailed
in
some
respect
in
our
reply
brief
as
to
what
the
facts
are.
they
began
on
the
reply
brief
at
page
20
--
24
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
essentially
correct.
i
believe
that
the
cases
by
and
large
involved
a
strike
by
one
union,
another
group
who
said
“we're
not
on
strike.”
we
had
a
right
to
perform
this
work
and
it
had
been
performed
by
supervisor
or
by
somebody
else.
so
that
yes,
it
was
the
expediency
that
the
railroad
was
put
to
have
the
work
performed.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
interpretation
of
the
agreement
is
not
really
the
--
the
precise
characterization.
i
think
it
would
be
more
proper
to
say
that
it
was
an
interpretation
of
the
overall
--
of
the
implied
condition
of
all
of
these
agreements.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
correct.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
correct.
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
and
the
adjustment
board
reports
which
are
reviewed
both
in
our
reply
brief
and
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
association
of
american
railroads
strikes
over
a
period,
i
believe
1955
are
reviewed
in
some
detail
as
well
as
the
early
history
of
carriers
who've
operated
during
the
strikes.
but
all
of
them
have
done
essentially
what
the
florida
east
coast
has
done.
you
use
your
supervisors
to
get
off
the
ground.
you
use
some
other
volunteers
that
these
people
who
are
performing
jobs
out
of
their
regular
class
or
craft
where
they
can
do
other
jobs
and
you
hire
replacements
and
you
train
them
as
quickly
as
you
can.
now,
most
of
the
strikes
mr.
chief
justice
in
the
railroad
industry,
in
recent
years
have
been
of
relevantly
short
duration.
it
was
conceded
that
the
florida
east
coast
strike
is
unusual
in
that
regard.
it
is
longer,
and
has
been
longer
than
i
believe
any
other
strike
in
the
railroad
industry
has
been.
so
that
that
is
a
--
that
is
a
difference.
now,
prior
to
the
florida
east
coast
strike,
one
of
the
most
severe
nationwide
strikes
was
the
1922
shop
craft
strike.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
1922
which
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
1922.
now
this
was
a
nationwide
strike.
and
during
the
shop
craft
strike
of
1922,
the
--
it
had
a
very,
very
serious
impact
on
the
economy
of
the
country.
there's
no
question
about
it.
but
during
this
strike
many,
many
of
the
carriers
as
the
ar
has
pointed
out
in
their
reply
brief
provided
some
level
of
service.
again,
in
1946
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
no.
the
railroad
--
the
railway
labor
act
was
not
passed
until
1926
mr.
chief
justice,
four
years
later.
now,
we
do
say,
and
i
think
that
it
might
be
appropriate
at
this
point
to
simply
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
railway
labor
act
was
passed
in
1926,
four
years
after
the
beginning
of
this
nationwide
strike.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
congress
had
this
specially
in
mind.
it
had
the
clearest
example
of
a
paralysis
of
the
entire
railroad
transportation
industry
and
the
fact
that
carriers
did
provide
service
during
the
period
of
strike
and
yet
in
the
railway
labor
act
which
had
passed
in
1926
although
it
puts
status
quo
provisions
at
various
points
before
he
reached
the
right
to
strike,
there
it's
not
one
word
in
the
legislative
history,
there
isn't
one
word
in
the
statute
that
indicates
that
congress
did
intended
to
or
had
any
intention
of
placing
any
limitation
on
the
right
of
self-help
once
the
strike
began.
everything
in
the
railway
labor
act
was
designed
to
try
to
prevent
strikes,
but
if
it
did
not
succeed
in
preventing
strikes
then
the
parties
will
allow
the
self-help
to
resolve
it
--
their
differences.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
oh
yes.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
well,
one
that
comes
to
mind
immediately
mr.
chief
justice
was
the
nationwide
strike
which
was
called
in
1946
by
the
engineers
and
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
now,
this
was
unusual
in
one
respect
in
that
there
had
been
an
initial
strike
date
set
and
in
anticipation
of
this
original
strike
date,
the
president
of
the
united
states
seized
all
of
the
railroads
in
the
country
under
a
statute
which
was
then
in
effect.
the
original
strike
was
postponed.
so
that
when
the
strike
actually
took
place
in
1946,
the
government
was
under
control
of
the
railroads
and
the
strike
was
in
effect
against
the
united
states.
now,
not
only
did
the
carrier
after
carrier
and
we
did
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief
a
reference
to
the
survey
in
the
railway
age
of
the
different
railroads
that
provided
service
during
this
period
of
strike.
i
believe
this
strike
lasted
only
two
days
but
it
was
nationwide
in
a
great
significance
to
the
economy
of
the
country.
now,
not
only
did
many
of
the
railroads
try
to
operate
by
using
supervisors,
but
it
was
done
at
the
behest
of
and
with
the
complete
knowledge
of
the
united
states
itself.
then
there
was
the
strike
on
the
lan
which
lasted
47
or
48
days.
i
believe
that
was
in
1955.
there
had
been
other
strikes
on
airlines
as
well
as
carriers.
the
numbers
of
strikes
are
again
detailed
in
the
reply
brief
of
both
the
association
of
american
railroads
and
our
reply
brief.
the
30th
annual
report
of
the
mediation
board
for
1963
and
1964
for
example
refers
to
the
eastern
airlines
strike
which
began
june
23,
1962,
flight
operations
were
resumed
in
september
of
1962,
and
the
strike
on
the
florida
east
coast
which
began
january
23,
1963.
the
54-55
annual
report
refers
to
the
lan
strike.
in
each
of
these,
the
mediation
board
simply
reports
that
these
carriers
resumed
service
or
maintained
service
during
the
period
of
a
strike.
the
most
recent
strike
what
i
recall
referred
to
in
the
--
the
ar
--
initial
brief
is
the
houston
terminal
authority.
this
lasted
well
over
a
month,
i
forgot
the
precise
number
of
days,
but
its
well
over
a
month.
and
again
they
operated
throughout
the
period
of
the
strike
by
using
supervisors
and
by
hiring
replacements.
now
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
oh!
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
we
recognized
that
each
one
of
these
unions
continue
to
represent
the
employees
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
all
of
them
--
all
of
--
we
haven't
--we
have
never
set
the
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
no.
we
don't
say
that
mr.
justice
white.
we
say
that
these
--
these
emergency
conditions
that
we
have
to
resort
to
that
this
is
a
matter
of
self-help
as
a
matter
of
right
of
the
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
now
on
everything
else
we
say
he
has
the
--
he
has
a
positive
and
absolute
duty
to
bargain
with
the
union.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that's
true
mr.
justice
brennan
but
consider
the
--
consider
the
impossibility
of
going
forward
on
the
basis
of
bargaining
about
these
emergency
changes
or
the
apprenticeship
program.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
that
it
is
perfectly
correct
as
has
been
suggested
that
the
union
who
calls
a
strike
is
not
going
to
agree
to
a
weight
for
us
to
beat
the
strike.
but
if
they
did
how
long,
how
long
would
it
take?
the
1959
rules
dispute
which
was
before
this
court
in
the
p&o
case
started
in
1959
and
the
decision
of
this
court
wasn't
until
1963.
so
if
it's
a
year
--
if
we
--
if
we
exceed
all
speed
records
for
having
a
dispute
under
the
--
the
railway
labor
act
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
you
could
not
bargain,
and
you
could
not
negotiate,
and
could
not
complete
the
procedures
of
the
act
in
order
to
--
to
resume
the
operation
of
railroad
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time
in
the
future.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
you
would
continue,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
we
believe
that
they
would
have
the
right
to
file
any
grievance
that
they
might
desire
to
file.
now,
if
that
involved
a
condition
which
the
railroad
--
railway
had
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
well
yes,
there
is
a
procedure
for
that.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
no.
if
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
for
--
for
a
very
long
period
of
time,
mr.
justice
white,
the
unions
were
not
processing
grievances
on
behalf
of
replacements.
in
more
recent
months
that
they
have
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
i
do
not
know
the
answer,
mr.
justice
white
where
a
replacement
has
asked
the
union
to
handle
his
case
and
it
had
been
rejected.
i
can
only
say
that
in
the
beginning
they
were
not
presenting
any
grievances
on
behalf
of
the
replacements.
in
more
recent
months
they
have
been.
some
of
the
unions
have
been,
not
all
of
them
but
some
of
the
unions
have
in
more
recent
months
been
presenting
grievances
in
representing
the
replacements.
mr.
william
b.
devaney
this
was
a
--
we
felt
--
mr.
william
b.
devaney
well,
this
was
a
--
we
ask
as
one
of
the
--
we
ask
as
one
of
the
--
the
conditions
of
the
district
court
that
the
district
court
say
that
the
union
shop
provision
was
not
enforceable
unless
and
until
such
time
his
membership
was
offered
to
the
replacements.
now,
we
weren't
saying
--
we
weren't
saying
casted
out,
we
were
saying
here
is
the
history
of
the
discrimination
from
the
day
the
strike
began.
if
you
or
your
former
members
who
came
back
to
work,
you
have
five,
you
are
cast
out
of
the
union,
the
replacements
who
have
applied
for
membership
not
one
of
them,
not
one
person
has
ever
been
taken
into
the
union.
now,
we
say
that
the
--
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
trainmen
case
because
the
same
issue
was
raised
there
and
when
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
corollary
to
the
right
of
the
union
to
strike
was
we
had
the
right
to
operate
and
we
have
--
it
was
not
a
violation
to
hire
replacements,
so
we
had
no
duty
to
discharge
unless
or
until
membership
that
was
offered
to
them
without
discrimination.
we
said
to
the
district
court
that
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
meant
that
if
these
people
were
being
discriminated
against
that
they
shouldn't
be
subject
to
discharge
until
membership
was
offered
to
them.
the
district
court
did
not
agree
with
this
and
it
did
not
contain
this
provision
and
to
that
extent
you
are
correct.
we
did
take
the
position
that
if
these
people
have
to
be
subject
to
the
union
shop
agreement
that
it
should
be
subject
to
the
union
making
membership
available
and
if
it
isn't
willing
to
do
that,
then
the
agreement
as
to
that
should
not
be
enforceable
during
the
period
of
the
strike.
now
if
i
may
refer
to
one
last
matter
which
the
unions
have
raised,
it
is
this
question
of
the
toledo,
p.
&
w.r.
and
eastern
case.
now,
we
believe
that
this
has
no
application
for
any
purpose.
to
begin
with
we
have
not
asked
for
any
equitable
relief.
it's
our
position
that
the
right
of
self-help
is
a
legal
right
that
this
all
we
have
asked
for
as
all
we
feel
we're
entitled
to.
but
second,
the
toledo,
p
&
w.r.
case
itself
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
court
in
that
decision
was
confronted
with
a
situation
where
the
carrier
had
refused
arbitration
prior
to
the
strike.
now,
the
exchange
of
correspondence
is
set
forth
in
appendix
a
of
our
reply
brief.
it
clearly
shows
that
florida
east
coast
before
the
strike
simply
said
that
we
believe
your
offer
of
arbitration
is
premature
that
there
should
be
further
mediation.
the
union
came
back
and
said,
“we
don't
--
we
reject
the
suggestion
of
mediation.
we
reject
arbitration.”
at
that
point,
the
board
listened
to
the
dispute.
later
florida
east
coast
even
said,
“well
--
to
the
mediation
board,
we
believe
that
there
should
be
an
emergency
already
created.
there
was
no
such
recommendation
and
the
strike
began.
now,
toledo
says,
as
i
read
the
case
clearly
and
without
any
provocation
that
it
applies
only
where
the
procedures
of
railway
labor
act
including
the
proffer
of
arbitration
has
been
rejected.
there
was
no
rejection
prior
to
the
strike
which
are
the
procedures
of
railway
labor
act
by
the
carrier.
it
was
a
rejection
by
the
unions
of
arbitration.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
offer
of
secretary
of
labor
were
some
four
months
after
the
strike
began
to
help
--
to
bring
about
a
settlement
means
that
even
if
equitable
relief
were
asked
for
that
the
refusal
four
months
after
the
strike
had
began
and
after
we
got
back
into
operation
it
meant
that
we
have
not
made
use
of
the
procedures
of
the
act.
so
that
we
say
that
the
--
that
the
argument
really
has
no
application
to
this
case.
we
believe
that
--
that
however
it's
construed
that
it
would
not
be
applicable
by
way
of
limitation
on
anything
that
florida
east
coast
has
done.
thank
you
very
much.
