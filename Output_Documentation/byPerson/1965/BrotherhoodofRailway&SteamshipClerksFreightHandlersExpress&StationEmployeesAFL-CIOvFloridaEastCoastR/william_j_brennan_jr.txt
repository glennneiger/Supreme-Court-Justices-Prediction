justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
see,
mr.
bender,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
here,
the
issue
of
which
after
exhaustion
of
the
procedures,
the
strike
occurs
for
these
early
wages,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
any
event,
they
were
limited
issues,
were
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
after
the
procedures
had
all
been
exhausted
the
union
did
go
on
strike
because
they're
not
satisfied
with
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
what
was
it,
an
award
or
something
of
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
any
event
whatever
it
might
be
as
i
understand
it
this
whole
thing
about
the
dispute
over
some
limited
issues.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
after
everything
had
been
exhausted
there
was
a
lawful
strike.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
--
the
carrier
then
insisted
that
it
had
the
right
and
the
fact
to
abrogate
all
other
provisions
of
the
agreement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
substitute
its
own
working
conditions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
--
not
only
the
conditions
related
to
the
particular
issues
involved
in
dispute
but
everything
else.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
including
the
replacement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
your
position
is
that
the
replacements
have
to
work
at
least
as
regardless
all
issues
are
kept
to
in
dispute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
working
conditions
of
the
contract
specified.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
to
be
entitled
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
did
the
--
did
the
court
of
appeals
suggest
some
statutory
source
for
that
authority?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
it
that
it's
suggesting?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
that?
where
does
that
come
from?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
say
it
was
constitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
suggesting
that
--
the
statute
by
implication?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bender,
is
there
no
duty
to
operate
under
the
--
in
the
state
commerce
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it's
not
really
a
state
though?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
bender,
may
i
ask
you
right
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
the
railroad
free
or
not
to
hire
at
a
unilaterally
fix
wage
rate
at
that
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
a
lot
of
fact
that
they
hire
these
--
what
rates
that
hires
these
replacements?
at
the
contract,
at
the
offered
--
they
suggested
a
decrease
as
i
would
call
it,
have
they
not
10%
or
something
like?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
if
they
hired
them?
are
those
the
decrease
rates?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
a
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
they
--
did
they
hire
them
at
rates?
the
contract
paid
was
something
in
excess
with
the
contract.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
statute's
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
you
referred
to
something
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what
happened
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
for
example
[inaudible]
i
gather
that
you
don't
--
they'll
have
a
duty
to
bargain
over
the
issue
which
was
brought
on
the
strike.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
none.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
if
that
bargaining
process
resulted
in
a
settlement
of
the
wages,
would
you
also
have
departed
over
the
rest
of
the
concerned
with
the
agreement
or
they
--
the
one
you
settled
away
these
issues
that
[inaudible]
they
strike
again
and
the
men
goes
back
to
work.
in
all
other
respects
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
your
position
really
is
only
during
the
continuance
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
those
determinations.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
condition
herein
[inaudible]
so
that
you
may
in
a
factual
manner
operate
the
railroad
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
what
--
what
[inaudible]
settlement
of
the
wages
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
assuming
again
[inaudible]
have
the
[inaudible]
a
negotiation
settlement
or
wages,
was
there
anything
about
the
agreements
which
would
prevent
a
negotiation
of
the
issue
of
what
strikers
in
place
replacements
--
for
what
replacements
[inaudible]
as
they
are
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
be
subject
to
bargaining
of
what
is
all
going
through
deviation
of
the
[inaudible]?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
probably
would
be
urged
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
you
don't
agree
what
the
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
would
be
the
settlement
for
that?
could
every
job
of
the
railroad
be
[inaudible]
tomorrow
morning?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you
hired
ten
replacements
[inaudible]
and
that's
all
you
needed
to
do,
in
some
of
the
strikes
on
wages
--
tomorrow
morning
those
ten
would
continue
to
note
that
i
gather
until
such
time
if
it's
in
the
basis
--
one
of
the
same
job
[inaudible]
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
far
[inaudible]
beyond
what
the
district
court
has
said
you
may
do,
part
of
the
--
how
much
further
do
you
want
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
[inaudible]
do
you
want
to
go
so
far
as
the
[inaudible]
the
arrangement
of
this
type
--
the
agreement
shall
be
completely
sustained?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
that's
included
there,
that
you
want
--
and
you
want
to
be
allowed
if
in
your
business
argument
--
upgrading
the
railway
and
you
must
be
so
in
the
strike
circle
to
the
part
of
anything
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
red
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
those
--
were
those
cases
with
this
that
this
causes
[inaudible]
questions
would
rather
search
schemes,
that
is
for
the
railroad
to
operate
were
charged
with
this
violations
of
the
agreements
and
that
the
court
held
no
they
were
not
violations
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
adjustment
board
[inaudible]
did
this
as
a
matter
of
interpretation
within
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
â€“
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
least
it
only
goes
with
the
settlement
of
the
strike.
as
justice
white
suggests
you
wouldn't
bargain
on
wages
and
hourly
rates
which
is
originally
involved
in
the
replacements
that
because
of
the
emergency
conditions
you
say,
you
have
to
have
some
flexible
--
flexible
in
anyway
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
[inaudible]
as
justice
white
suggests
that
of
course
you
recognized
that
you
need
to
continue
bargaining
with
the
union,
but
that
it's
limited
to
the
issues
involved
in
the
strike
and
in
settlement
and
certainly
does
not
include
any
[inaudible]
workout
arrangements
that
maybe
involved
with
the
replacements.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
this

let
