justice
potter
stewart
and
the
discretion
of
the
president
is
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
let
me
see
mr.
bender,
the
carrier
takes
the
position
that
it
was
free
to
do
this
only
after
the
strike
--
only
after
the
strike
commenced.
now,
after
the
strike,
were
any
--
were
the
employees
then
who
are
working
for
the
railroad
represented
by
any
of
these
labor
organizations?
justice
potter
stewart
how?
justice
potter
stewart
they
have
chosen
them?
justice
potter
stewart
but
those
employees
went
out
--
were
all
out
on
strike,
weren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
here
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
the
union
didn't
lose
them
but
--
but
all
of
those
employees
were
out
on
a
strike.
justice
potter
stewart
all
of
them
represented
--
who
have
been
represented
by
these
--
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
suggesting
mr.
bender
that
the
railroad
didn't
have
the
--
it's
not
the
right
to
operate
at
least
fairly
they're
trying
to
operate?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
that
it's
not
a
constitutional
right,
i
mean
true
acts
against
right
or
cases
like
that,
you
think
you
can
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
engage
in
a
gainful
employment
which
is
legal.
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
telling
us
that
it
did.
justice
potter
stewart
and
included
in
that
right,
i
suppose
you
--
was
the
right
to
hire
new
employees
to
replace
the
striking
employees,
was
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
they
didn't
have
to.
they
weren't;
confined
in
trying
to
operate
the
railroad
to
vice
presidents
in
the
second
page
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
benders,
is
anything
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
having
to
do
with
the
--
how
new
employees
are
to
be
hired
putting
aside
the
question
of
let's
try
it
during
our
normal
operation.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
the
union
shoppers
of
close
shoppers
provide
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
--
a
moment
ago
you
in
answer
to
your
question
i
find
--
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
didn't
question
the
right
of
the
railroad
after
the
strike
commenced
to
hire
a
new
employees
to
replace
the
striking
workers.
justice
potter
stewart
and
now
you
have
told
me
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
provides
quite
specifically
as
to
how
new
employees
are
to
be
hired.
were
those
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
under
your
position
still
in
effect?
justice
potter
stewart
so
they
had
to
hire
what
union
members
and
they
have
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
what
if
they
couldn't?
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
close
shop
or
the
union
shop?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
the
close
shop
is
legal
in
this
industry
nowadays.
justice
potter
stewart
union
shop
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
those
are
union
shops.
justice
potter
stewart
the
members
after
being
hired
had
to
pay
the
union.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
they
will.
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
provides
an
elaborate
kind
of
an
apprentice
after
a
program
of
the
employee?
justice
potter
stewart
would
it
had
been
possible
or
practical
at
all
for
a
railroad
in
hiring
replacements
to
go
through
that.
it
had
to
have
engineers
for
instance
and
conductors
and
brakemen
and
it
didn't
--
and
it
couldn't
work
with
apprentice
engineers
or
brakemen.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
union
which
is
called
its
people
out
on
strike
is
not
going
to
agree
to
anything
that's
going
to
make
it
easy
or
even
possible
for
the
--
for
the
railroad
to
continue
operating,
is
it?
that's
just
a
--
you're
going
to
be
asking
for
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
ambivalence,
it
seems.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
employer
--
the
carrier
instituted
the
negotiations
about
this?
justice
potter
stewart
but
a
matter
of
those
requests
--
to
began
these
things.
justice
potter
stewart
who
--
who
served
the
notice?
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
union
may?
justice
potter
stewart
in
practice
it's
the
carrier
who
does
it.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
you?
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
bender
i
thought
--
am
i
wrong
if
there's
an
amicus
brief
here
on
the
part
of
the
association
on
american
railroads.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
represents
all
of
our
railroads?
justice
potter
stewart
so
florida
east
coast
is
not
the
only
carrier
to
take
this
position
all
the
railroads.
justice
potter
stewart
the
position
as
i
understand
involved
the
american
railroads
represented
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
--
you
can
--
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
i
thought
before
the
strike
when
this
dispute
was
going
on
between
these
unions
and
all
of
the
railroads
that
it
was
the
unions
who
refuse
to
arbitrate.
am
i
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
the
issues
which
eventuated
in
this
strike?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
i
had
read
that
in
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
union
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
--
under
the
act,
it's
the
recommendation.
justice
potter
stewart
with
the
majesty
of
the
chief
executive
behind
this?
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
bid
only
for
vacancy
--
a
senior
man
can
bump
a
junior
manager.
justice
potter
stewart
during
his
absence
--
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
their
contention
and
maybe
i've
misunderstood
it
is
even
more
extreme
than
that
that
you
couldn't
hire
him
as
a
machinist,
you
have
to
hire
him
as
an
apprentice.
justice
potter
stewart
in

study,
that
would
be
the
