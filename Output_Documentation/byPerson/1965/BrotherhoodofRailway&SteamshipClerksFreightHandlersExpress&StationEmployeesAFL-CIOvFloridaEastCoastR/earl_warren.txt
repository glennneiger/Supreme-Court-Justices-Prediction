mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bender
you
may
be
admitted
for
that
purpose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'd
like
to
ask
you
question,
does
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
authorize
the
use
of
supervisory
personnel
in
the
event
of
the
strike?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
i
ask
you
if
the
--
i
ask
you
if
the
agreement
provided
made
any
provision
for
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
didn't
you
say
a
little
while
ago,
i
thought
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
railroad
could
use
supervisory
personnel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
event
of
a
strike.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
say
the
railroad
might
contend
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
your
--
it's
in
the
question
whether
they
will
agree
or
not,
do
they
have
the
right
under
the
contract
to
do
it
whether
the
union
agrees
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
unless
you
--
unless
you
decided
it
yourself
when
you
told
us
that
they
--
clearly
that
they
did
have
the
right
to
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
--
i
may
have
misunderstood
you
but
i
thought
you
said
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
devaney.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
agreement
that
gives
you
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
you
raise
that
question
with
the
union?
chief
justice
earl
warren
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words
you
never
did
it
until
after
you
had
unilaterally
adopted
that
factors
and
we're
in
the
courts.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
it
was
never
raised
by
you
until
you're
in
the
courts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
was
that
a
condition
of
not
doing
some
of
the
other
things
that
you
were
doing
or
it's
just
something
that
you
demanded
in
the
court
as
a
matter
of
relief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
may
i
ask
this
mr.
devaney?
in
view
of
the
changes
that
you
have
made
in
the
rules
of
the
agreement
in
order
to
sustain
your
position
on
the
wages.
if
you
subsequently
agreed
with
the
railroads
on
wages,
i
mean
with
the
unions
on
wages,
would
you
then
be
entitled
to
bargain
with
the
unions
again
on
all
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
contract
or
would
those
come
back
automatically,
if
you
settle
this
particular
phase
of
the
agreement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
wondered
if
you
could
answer
my
question
a
little
more
specifically.
would
the
settlement
of
this
strike
on
the
--
on
the
wage
problem
which
you
present
here
also
keep
intact
all
the
other
provisions
of
the
bargaining
agreement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
wouldn't
have
a
right
--
you
wouldn't
have
a
right
to
--
to
renegotiate
all
those
other
--
those
other
provisions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
wouldn't
have
the
right
to
say
when
the
--
when
you
agreed
on
these
wages
now
because
you
violated
your
agreement
is
struck
we
want
to
negotiate
all
these
other
--
other
phases
of
the
contract
before.
you're
entitled
to
go
back
to
work.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i
just
wanted
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
if
an
operating
your
trains
at
the
present
time,
do
you
use
the
same
number
of
employees
on
the
train
that
you
use
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
operating
crew,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
same
number
of
--
same
number
of
trainmen
you
use.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
mean
--
i
mean
on
each
crew
regardless
of
how
--
how
far
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
you
use
the
same
number.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
engine
crews?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
to
say
a
little
while
ago
that
your
practice
during
the
strike
has
been
used
by
all
the
railroads
in
the
country
for
the
past
40
years
when
they
operate
under

conditions.
