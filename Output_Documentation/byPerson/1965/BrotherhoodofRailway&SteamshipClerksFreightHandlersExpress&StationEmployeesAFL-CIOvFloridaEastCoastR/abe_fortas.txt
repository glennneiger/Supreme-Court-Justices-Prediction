justice
abe
fortas
mr.
bender,
the
--
as
i
understand
what
you've
told
us
this
morning,
it
amounts
to
a
concession
that
the
railroad
hearing
the
strike,
they
engage
in
certain
employment
practices
or
uncertain
employment
practices
which
are
not
permitted
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
such
as
with
respect
to
the
apprentice
program.
as
i
understand
it,
you
have
suggested
that
railroad
would
have
to
present
those
to
the
union
first
and
perhaps
indicate
its
willingness
to
bargain
about
it,
about
them
or
it
might
have
to
bargain
in
good
faith
about
them
if
the
railroad
were
willing
to
do
so,
am
i
right
thus
far?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
trying
to
agree
with
you,
so
let's
speak
clearly.
justice
abe
fortas
it
was
alleged
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
bender,
please
forgive
me
if
i
regard
that
as
not
of
the
essence
what
you're
say
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
from
you
right
now
is
this.
is
it
or
is
it
not
your
position
that
during
a
lawful
strike
a
railroad
may
engage
in
certain
employment
practices
which
are
--
are
not
permitted
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
government
concedes
that
it
can
do
that.
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
listen
to
you,
you
suggested
as
an
example
of
that
the
circumvention
or
the
waving
or
whatever
phrase
you
want
to
-
whatever
terms
you
want
to
apply
of
the
apprentice
program.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
may
think
it's
very
difficult
for
me
to
try
to
check
my
point
with
you,
so
i
like
to
ask
it
bluntly.
is
it
or
is
it
not
your
position
that
during
a
lawful
strike
the
railroad
is
at
liberty
to
hire
necessary,
essential
employees
to
run
the
railroad
without
--
outside
of
the
procedures
specified
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
have
i
made
my
--
did
i
put
my
question
clearly?
justice
abe
fortas
to
hire
them,
to
recruit
them
and
to
hire
them.
let's
suppose
if
the
union
as
mr.
justice
stewart
was
suggesting,
suppose
all
the
union
employees
were
out,
all
the
engineers
were
out,
and
the
railroad
says
we
want
to
run
our
trains,
so
we're
going
to
disregard
the
procedures
that
are
--
we
are
going
outside
of
big
procedures
specified
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
get
some
engineers
to
run
our
trains.
it
is
my
--
is
it
clear
up
to
this
point?
justice
abe
fortas
now
what
i
want
to
know
is,
is
it
your
position,
the
railroad
can
do
that
or
is
it
your
position
that
the
railroad
cannot?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
tell
me
why?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
i
though
--
i
thought
i
may
be
confused
but
i
thought
that
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
questions
you
said
just
the
opposite.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
interested
--
i'm
not
interested
in
that
word.
justice
abe
fortas
but
are
you
saying
then
that
the
agreement
itself
contains
sufficient
flexibility
so
that
in
these
circumstances
the
railroad
could
hire
engineers
without
reference
to
the
usual
procedures.
justice
abe
fortas
no
but
this
is--
this
is
--
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
that's
quite
an
important
point
as
to
whether
the
railroad
can
or
cannot
proceed
in
some
way
other
than
the
way
provided
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
recruit
for
example
engineers
to
run
its
railroads,
to
run
its
trains
during
a
lawful
strike.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
who
would
determine
that?
would
that
be
by
a
court
order?
justice
abe
fortas
i
--
i
understand
you
now,
i
think
and
it's
a
--
it's
a
--
the
flat
position.
justice
abe
fortas
that
regardless
of
what
maybe
the
means
of
the
railroad
to
operate
during
the
strike,
the
railroad
is
bound
by
the
four
corners
of
the
agreement.
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
it
has
--
if
it
--
if
there
is
any
flexibility
for
departure
from
non-strike
procedures
the
authority
for
such
departure
has
to
be
found
in
a
fair
reading
of
agreement.
justice
abe
fortas
so
if
they
will
not
take
that
flat
position,
i
would
--
next
have
to
ask
you
why
you
disagree
with
at
this
stage
with
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
abe
fortas
why
the
same
thing?
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
it's
the
same
controversy.
it's
the
same
question
we're
talking
about.
