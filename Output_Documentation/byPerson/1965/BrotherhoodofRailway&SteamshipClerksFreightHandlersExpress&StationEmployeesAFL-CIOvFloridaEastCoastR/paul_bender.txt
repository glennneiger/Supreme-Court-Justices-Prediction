mr.
paul
bender
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
three
petitions
arise
from
a
single
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
that
decision
affirmed
in
an
injunction
entered
in
the
middle
district
of
florida,
in
action
brought
by
the
united
states
against
the
florida
east
coast
railway
to
enjoin
what
we
allege
to
be
violations
of
the
railway
labor
act.
eleven
unions
representing
nonoperating
employees
of
the
florida
east
coast
railway
intervened
in
the
district
court
in
support
of
the
injunction
and
participated
in
the
court
of
appeals.
one
of
the
petitions
here
has
been
filed
by
the
united
states,
thats
number
782.
one,
taking
essentially
the
same
position
has
been
filed
by
the
unions,
that's
number
750
and
the
third
which
is
a
cross
petition
has
been
filed
by
the
carriers,
that's
number
783.
for
purposes
of
the
oral
argument,
i
shall
present
the
argument
in
chief
for
the
position
jointly
taken
by
the
unions
and
by
the
unites
states.
mr.
devaney
will
then
argue
for
the
carrier
and
mr.
rutledge
representing
the
unions
will
present
a
rebuttal
argument
for
the
position
which
the
unions
and
the
united
states
jointly
take.
the
issue
here
essentially
is
a
simple
one.
the
question
is
where
and
to
what
extent
carriers
covered
by
the
railway
labor
act
must
obey
first
their
duty
to
bargain
with
the
representatives
of
their
employees
and
secondly,
their
duty
to
adhere
to
existing
collective
bargaining
agreements
which
they
have
previously
made
with
those
representatives.
during
the
course
of
a
lawful
strike,
the
unites
states
takes
the
position
that
both
of
those
duties
remain
upon
the
carrier
during
the
course
of
a
lawful
strike.
it
must
both
bargain
with
the
representatives
of
its
employees
and
it
must
adhere
to
collective
bargaining
agreements
which
continue
to
exist
during
the
course
of
that
strike.
the
carrier,
on
the
other
hand,
takes
the
position
that
it
is
under
neither
those,
that
it
must
neither
bargain
nor
adhere
to
existing
collective
bargaining
agreements.
let
me
briefly
sketch
to
the
court
the
statutory
scheme
which
maybe
somewhat
unfamiliar
under
which
these
issues
arise.
in
the
first
place,
like
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
railway
labor
act
contains
a
general
duty
to
bargain
between
employers
and
the
representatives
of
their
employees.
it
goes
a
little
bit
further
in
general
than
the
railway
--
than
the
national
labors
relations
act,
however,
in
providing
rather
affirmatively
that
there's
a
duty
of
all
carriers
to
exert
every
reasonable
effort
to
make
and
maintain
agreements
concerning
rates
of
pay
rules
and
working
conditions
and
to
settle
all
disputes
arising
out
of
those
agreements
with
the
representatives
of
their
employee.
there's
nothing
like
that
that
explicit
in
the
national
labors
relations
act
about
the
duty
to
make
and
maintain
agreements
and
of
course
a
continuing
duty
to
bargain
with
the
representatives.
then
the
act
becomes
much
more
explicit
than
the
national
labors
relations
act
and
much
more
absolute
in
describing
the
meaning
of
the
duty
to
bargain,
“once
agreements
have
been
reached
with
the
representatives
of
employees,
as
agreements
had
been
reached
in
this
case,
first
the
act
provides
that
when
either
the
carrier
or
the
union
wishes
to
change
existing
agreements
covering
rates
of
pay
rules
or
working
conditions
notice
must
be
served
on
the
other
party
and
negotiations
between
the
parties
undertaken.
if
these
negotiations
fail
to
result
in
agreements
either
party
may
then
invoke
the
services
of
the
national
mediation
board
which
is
created
primarily
for
that
purpose,
to
mediate
disputes
which
haven't
been
settled
by
a
negotiation
or
the
mediation
board
may
itself
proffer
its
services
even
if
the
parties
don't
ask
it
to.
if
this
mediation
fails,
the
board,
the
mediation
board,
is
then
directed
to
encourage
the
parties
to
submit
to
the
dispute
to
binding
arbitration,
although
it
can't
compel
the
parties
to
do
so.”
if
one
or
both
of
the
parties
refuses
arbitration
and
there's
another
step,
the
last
resort
you
can
create
a
presidential
commission,
an
emergency
board
it's
called,
to
recommend
the
solution
to
the
dispute
and
again
its
recommendations
aren't
binding.
and
--
mr.
paul
bender
right.
i
think
the
mediation
board
has
some
rule
in
making
recommendations
for
the
president
but
of
course
the
president
does
not
have
to
appoint
the
board.
in
thus
providing
these
detailed
procedures
which
don't
have
any
direct
parallel
in
national
labors
relations
act,
the
act
provides
as
explicitly
as
one
can
imagine
that
existing
conditions,
those
subject
to
the
dispute,
those
that
one
party
or
the
other
wants
to
change
must
not
be
changed
by
the
carrier
while
these
negotiations,
the
mediation,
the
arbitration
or
if
there's
an
emergency
board,
the
emergency
board
is
acting,
while
these
procedures
are
in
progress,
you
may
not
change
the
existing
conditions.
then
there's
a
general
provision
which
again
provides
as
explicitly
as
you
can
imagine,
that
you
cannot
make
changes
without
entering
into
these
statutory
procedures.
that
provision,
section
2
seventh
of
the
act,
provides
that
unless
the
statutory
from
the
negotiation
procedures
are
undertaken,
no
carrier,
its
officers,
agents
or
agent
shall
change
the
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions
of
it's
employees
as
a
class
as
embodied
in
agreements.
thus,
it
seems
to
us
quite
clear
and
i
don't
think
anyone
disagrees
with
this,
that
the
duty
to
bargain
under
the
railway
labor
act
is
defined
in
part
and
perhaps
its
most
essential
part,
as
the
duty
to
adhere
to
existing
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
not
to
change
those
agreements
for
employees
as
a
class
not
the
institute
what
would
amount
to
amendments
or
changes
without
bargaining
with
the
representatives
of
the
employees.
at
the
same
time
as
the
carrier
thus
found
there
is
a
similar
rule
that
applies
to
unions
requiring
the
maintenance
of
existing
agreements
while
these
statutory
procedures
are
in
progress.
thus,
when
a
union
for
example
is
engaged
in
a
wage
dispute
with
a
carrier,
it
may
not
strike
on
to
and
i
think
everyone
agrees
with
this,
although
this
is
not
as
explicit
in
the
act,
it
may
not
strike
until
it
has
exhausted
the
statutory
procedures
just
as
the
carrier
may
not
unilaterally
change
the
wages
until
it's
exhausted
the
procedures
are
the
carrier
can
engage
in
a
lockout
until
the
procedures
have
been
exhausted.
when
the
procedures
are
exhausted
without
a
solution
being
reached,
then
and
only
then
may
the
union
strike
to
achieve
its
aims
of
proposal,
and
then
and
only
then
may
the
carrier
implement
the
changes
which
it
proposes
without
first
exhausting
the
statutory
procedures,
both
parties
have
to
stand
by
existing
agreements.
that's
what
the
act
provides
and
i
can
imagine
that
it
could
do
so
anymore
clearly.
now,
it's
--
as
i
said
i
think
it's
conceded
that
those
provisions
as
i've
described
them
are
applicable
in
the
ordinary
situation.
the
question
here
is,
and
also
let
me
put
that
they
are
enforceable
by
injunction.
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
that
any
longer.
there
once
was
a
question
whether
the
norris-laguardia
act
might
have
prevented
either
of
the
parties
from
enjoining
the
other
party.
that
is
no
longer
a
question
seriously
open
to
dispute.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
that
statutory
scheme
as
i
described,
it
remains
applicable
during
a
lawful
strike.
the
carrier
argues
that
those
provisions
do
not.
in
its
view,
when
a
strike
occurs
even
though
it's
a
lawful
strike,
it
is
entirely
free,
completely
free
to
implement
whatever
wages,
work
rules
or
working
conditions
it
desires
for
as
long
as
the
strike
continues.
and
that
it
doesn't
have
to
bargain
with
the
union
about
the
implementation
of
any
of
those
procedures
either
before
the
strike
or
during
the
strike.
as
far
as
it's
our
concerned,
the
strike
uses
a
complete
freedom
to
treat
its
employees
as
it
wishes
so
long
as
the
strike
continues
and
it
carriers
and
i
quote
from
it's
brief,
it
says
“it's
agreements
with
the
labor
organizations
were
suspended
during
the
period
of
the
strike
and
fec
was
not
required
even
to
attempt
to
comply
with.”
mr.
paul
bender
wages
and
a
notice
issue
also.
the
question
of
whether,
the
length
of
notice
you
had
to
give
before
layoffs
and
job
abolition.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
just
wages
and
that
no
decision,
correct.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
i'm
planning
to
get
into
this
in
a
minute,
but
yes,
that's
essentially
what
happened.
mr.
paul
bender
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
the
way
you
get
a
lawful
strike
in
the
industry.
let
me
say
that
now
--
mr.
paul
bender
exactly.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
right,
precisely.
now,
they
say
they
can
do
that.
we
say
that
they
have
got
to
adhere
to
their
agreements
as
written.
if
the
agreements
provide
for
what
they
can
do
during
a
strike
then
they
can
do
what
the
agreements
provide
for
what
they
can
do
during
the
strike.
mr.
paul
bender
under
the
act,
they
were.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
the
act
--
mr.
paul
bender
because
the
--
these
labor
organizations
were
they're
designated
--
had
been
the
designated
representatives
of
the
employees
in
those
classes.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
the
union
members
i
assume
were
all
out
on
strike,
at
least
most
of
them
were
but
under
the
act
there
had
never
been
a
new
designation
of
representatives
and
the
act
does
not
contain
any
provision.
i
think
this
is
quite
clear
which
provides
that
the
loss
of
representation
upon
the
union
losing
a
majority
of
the
employees
actually
working
at
that
time.
mr.
paul
bender
the
only
way
you
--
mr.
paul
bender
the
union
members
were
out
on
a
strike.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
but
the
act
--
the
union
still
represents
the
employees
in
that
class.
mr.
paul
bender
including
the
replacement.
mr.
paul
bender
surely.
mr.
paul
bender
we
--
we
believe
that
the
replacements
are
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
--
or
the
agreements
upon
negotiate
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
and
they
must.
it
--
it's
a
rule
which
is
for
their
benefit.
it's
a
rule
which
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
union
and
it's
a
rule
which
--
and
this
is
the
reason
we're
involved,
this
is
for
the
benefit
of
collective
bargaining
in
the
railway
industry
and
in
the
long
run
is
the
--
for
the
benefit
of
stable
labor
relationships.
but
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
union
doesn't
lose
its
status
as
bargaining
representative
simply
because
it
goes
out
on
strike.
that's
not
even
true
under
the
national
labors
relations
act
and
it's
certainly
isn't
true
under
this
act
where
there's
no
provision
provided
for
a
union
losing
its
representation
without
a
new
election,
without
a
new
representation
proceeding
being
commenced
and
that
has
never
happened
in
this
case.
now,
the
court
of
appeals,
in
all
of
these,
took
a
middle
brown
between
these
two
positions.
it
agreed
with
the
united
states
that
the
carrier
couldn't,
as
it
still
asserts
it
can
do,
completely
ignores
existing
agreements
and
ignore
the
union
because
the
union
is
out
on
strike.
the
court
did
however,
purport
to
write
a
new
gloss
into
the
act
and
it's
a
concededly
new
gloss
that
appears
nowhere
in
the
act
creating
an
exception
to
these
broad
prohibitions.
the
court
held
that
while
a
carrier
can
generally
change
its
collective
bargaining
agreements
during
the
strike,
it
can
institute
such
changes
in
these
agreements
and
--
as
are
and
i
quote
again,
“reasonably
necessary
to
effectuate
its
right
to
operate,
to
continue
to
run
its
railroad
under
strike
conditions.”
now,
we
think
this
gloss,
this
new
exception
while
it's
not
as
dangerous
to
collective
bargaining
and
it's
not
--
well,
it's
not
dangerous
to
collective
bargaining
as
the
rule
of
carriers
--
it
still
terribly
dangerous
to
bargaining
and
it's
still
contrary
to
the
terms
of
the
act
and
we
also
believe
that
there's
no
cause
for
it's
creation
at
this
time.
we're
frankly
concerned
here
to
overturn
this
principle
like
you
can
violate
collective
bargaining
agreements
during
a
strike
when
it's
necessary
to
operate
rather
than
its
application
in
this
case,
and
let
me
be
candid
about
that
now.
the
district
court
in
this
case
permitted
only
four
changes
under
this
exception
and
they
were
all
relatively
narrow
minor
changes.
if
that
were
all
that
were
going
to
happen
under
this
exception,
it
wouldn't
be
dangerous,
but
as
i
will
try
to
show
later,
we
think
its
potentialities
are
much
greater
and
there's
a
very
good
reason
for
getting
rid
of
this
now
because
the
difficulties
of
reviewing
these
broad
changes
in
the
future
when
they're
given
in
the
form
of
temporary
--
temporary
release
maybe
in
surmount
of.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
mr.
justice
brennan
it,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
suggested
that
it
arose
out
of
the
right
to
operate
of
a
railroad,
out
of
the
right
to
self-help
during
a
strike.
it
didn't
suggest
any
statutory
basis.
the
most
it
did
was
suggested
there
was
an
analogy
to
it
in
the
national
labors
relations
act.
we
don't
think
that's
true,
but
even
if
there
were,
we
think
the
railway
labor
act
as
i
tried
to
describe
it,
is
a
much
more
comprehensive
scheme
of
regulation
in
this
regard
and
the
terms
flatly
prohibit
any
changes.
and
that
if
you
are
going
to
have
an
exception,
you
shouldn't
upset
the
delicate
balance
of
power
in
the
industry
by
a
judicially
created
exception.
this
is
a
kind
of
thing
which
in
this
industry
which
congress
has
dealt
with
so
specifically
ought
to
come
from
congress.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
suggest
it
can
get
it
out
of
the
act
at
all.
mr.
paul
bender
it
came
from
the
right
of
a
carrier
to
operate.
it
thought
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
know.
they
didn't
suggest.
they
just
stay
with
the
--
mr.
paul
bender
no,
they
didn't
suggest
it
was
a
constitutional
right.
i
doubt
if
they
did
because
it
certainly
--
our
position
is
that
when
you
enter
into
an
agreement
the
effect
of
which
is
to
make
it
more
difficult
to
operate
during
a
strike
or
even
to
make
it
impossible
to
operate
during
a
strike,
you
may
have
agreed
a
way
you're
right
to
a
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
find
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
i
don't
see
where
it
could
be
found.
now
--
mr.
paul
bender
oh
no.
we
agree
that
the
railroad
--
there's
nothing
that
stops
the
railroad
from
attempting
to
operate.
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
--
that
operation
has
to
be
consistent
with
its
agreement.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
suppose
you
might
say
there's
an
abstract
right
of
a
railroad
operator
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
should
think
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
should
think
congress
might
be
able
to
modify
the
right
in
some
circumstances.
they
clearly
haven't
-
mr.
paul
bender
they
might
have
a
duty
to
operate
as
a
common
carrier
under
the
state
law
but
not,
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
violation
of
the
railway
labor
act.
i
think
if
those
two
things
come
into
collision,
there's
no
question
that
the
railway
labor
act
has
got
to
be
paramount.
same
--
the
same
sort
of
question
arises.
suppose
they
can
only
operate
in
an
unsafe
manner
which
would
violate
federal
safety
regulations
that
the
state
may
impose
upon
them
the
duty
to
operate
as
a
common
carrier
but
they
certainly
don't
have
the
duty
to
operate
in
violation
of
federal
safety
regulations.
and
we
say
they
don't
have
the
duty
to
operate
in
violation
of
the
law.
mr.
paul
bender
i
suppose
there
is
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
suppose
a
common
carrier
with
a
certificate
would
have
to
attempt
to
operate
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
but
certainly
if
it
was
prevented
from
doing
so
by
a
strike
because
railroads
generally
are
prevented
from
operating
during
a
strike,
there
would
be
no
violation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
clearly
i
think
that
you
can't
read
either
of
those
duties
as
carte
blanche
just
ignored
other
duties
under
the
railway
labor
act
including
the
duty
to
bargain.
in
the
long
run
that
sort
of
thing
is
much
more
detrimental
to
the
passage
of
interstate
commerce.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
railway
labor
act
was
because
labor
disputes
which
were
not
settled
amicably
has
been
causing
terrible
disruptions
to
commerce.
now,
if
you
say
that
you
can
forget
about
the
amicable
solution
of
labor
disputes
in
order
to
permit
carriers
to
operate
that's
going
to
boomerang
and
you
will
get
--
and
it's
congress'
choice,
it's
not
something
i'm
making
off,
i'm
asking
the
court
to
make
up.
that's
the
choice
that
congress
has
made.
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
that's
the
choice
of
this
court
has
got
to
enforce.
now,
let
me,
although
it
comes
rather
late,
let
me
go
through
these
issues
again
fairly
quickly
in
the
context
of
the
facts
here.
they
may
become
a
bit
clearer.
in
1961,
11
nonoperating
unions,
those
were
the
unions
representing
people
who
don't
actually
run
the
trains
like
clerks
and
machinists
which
had
had
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
all
of
the
large
railroads
in
the
country
for
a
number
of
years,
served
notice
upon
all
these
railroads
including
the
florida
east
coast
railroad
that
they
desired
a
25
cent
an
hour
wage
increase
and
some,
i
think
six
months
advance
notice
of
job
abolitions
and
layoffs.
the
carriers,
bargaining
as
a
group,
proposed
wage
decreases
and
notice
of
abolitions
of
only
24
hours.
this
dispute
as
to
whether
wages
should
go
up
or
down
or
what
the
notice
should
be
for
employees,
it
was
a
dispute
subject
to
the
--
to
the
negotiation
and
mediation
procedures
which
i
described
before.
thus,
the
carrier
couldn't
implement
their
proposals
nor
could
the
union
strike
to
implement
its
proposals
until
the
whole
bargaining
procedure
was
completed.
over
the
course
of
the
next
nine
months,
all
the
acts
of
bargaining
procedures
were
entered
into.
negotiation
and
mediation
failed
with
regard
to
this
dispute,
but
then
the
presidential
board
was
appointed
and
the
presidential
board
recommended
a
solution
of
a
10
cent
an
hour
wage
increase
and
5
days
notice
of
job
abolitions.
in
june
1962
this
settlement
was
accepted
by
every
class
i
railroad
in
the
country
except
the
carrier
in
this
case.
florida
east
coast
railroad
was
the
only
railroad
of
its
class,
those
are
the
large
railroads,
not
to
accept
the
presidential
board's
recommended
solution.
after
they
did
that,
the
mediation
board
attempted
further
to
mediate
the
dispute
which
was
now
a
dispute
simply
between
the
fec
and
these
unions.
this
mediation
was
unsuccessful
and
the
board
was
unsuccessful
in
getting
the
parties
to
agree
to
the
arbitration.
at
the
beginning
of
both
parties
refused
the
arbitration.
later
on,
the
union
when
requested
again
by
i
think
the
secretary
of
the
labor
agreed
to
arbitration
and
as
it
now
stands,
the
union
will
agree
to
arbitrate
the
carriers
will
not.
thus,
you
have
an
impasse
reach
with
florida
east
coast
and
these
unions
about
this
wage
dispute.
then
the
dispute
reaches
the
point
where
a
strike
becomes
lawful
where
you
can
use
self-help
in
these
court's
work
the
union
can
go
out
on
strike
to
enforce
its
demands.
the
carrier
can
implement
its
demands
if
it
wants
because
they've
gone
through
all
the
statutory
negotiation
procedures.
in
january
1963,
such
a
strike
began.
now,
i
emphasize
again,
this
strike
was
entirely
lawful.
it
occurred
only
after
the
union
had
in
good
faith
attempted
to
bargain
with
the
employer
about
the
requests
it
made
and
about
the
proposals
that
the
carrier
made,
which
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
before
it
limited
to
this
wage
dispute
and
this
notice
of
dispute,
how
much
notice
you
need
for
job
abolition?
at
the
beginning
the
strike
was
apparently
effective.
the
other
employees
refused
to
cross
the
picket
line
and
the
railroad
shut
down
for
about
a
week.
the
strike
however
didn't
result
as
apparently
most
railroad
strikes
do
result
in
a
fairly
quick
settlement
of
the
dispute
and
the
railroad
decided
to
attempt
to
operate
despite
the
strike.
as
i
say
again,
it
had
a
perfect
right
to
attempt
to
do.
the
question
is
whether
in
attempting
to
do
it,
it
did
it
consistently
with
it's
obligations
on
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
no
question
that
they
may
hire
replacements.
no
question
--
mr.
paul
bender
no,
absolutely
not.
they
can
try
and
they
did
hire
replacements.
that's
what
they
immediately
attempted
to
do.
now,
in
hiring
replacements
which
it
started
to
do
i
think
about
a
week
after
the
strike
began,
it
wholly
ignored
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
which
existed
with
regard
to
the
crafts
in
which
these
replacements
were.
and
instead,
it
got
the
replacements
to
sign
individual
agreements
setting
their
wages,
rules
and
working
conditions
in
terms
as
the
district
court
found,
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
this,
substantially
different
from
the
term
set
out
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
then
a
bit
later,
in
september
of
1963,
after
they've
made
this
rash
of
individual
contracts,
they
decided
to
formalize
and
then
put
them
in
a
single
document
which
they
called
a
condition
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
mr.
paul
bender
they
were
free
to
hire
but
they
were
not
free
to
hire
except
that
the
wages
provided
in
their
collective
bargaining
agreements,
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
say
there
is
probably
an
elaborate
procedure
about
bulletining
the
jobs
advertising
and
taking
people
in
terms
of
whether
they
have
seniority
on
the
road
previously
on
--
mr.
paul
bender
there's
the
union
shop.
there's
the
union
shop,
yes.
now,
those
--
the
union
shop
agreement
was
ignored.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
oh
surely.
mr.
paul
bender
what
the
union
members
wanted
to,
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
then
they
can
hire
a
non-union
member
but
the
agreement
doesn't
provide
that
you
can
only
hire
union
members.
the
union
shop
provision
doesn't
mean
that
you
have
to
join
the
union
before
you
go
to
work.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
it's
the
union
shop
as
i
understand.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
know
but
certainly,
no.
mr.
paul
bender
certainly
this
--
none
of
these
agreements
contain
the
close
shop.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
they
had
to
attempt
to
join
the
union.
mr.
paul
bender
now,
then
it's
up
to
the
union
whether
or
not
to
accept
them
into
membership
or
not.
if
the
--
if
they
attempt
to
join
and
the
union
refuses
to
permit
them
to
which
it
might
very
well
do
with
strike
there.
mr.
paul
bender
then
their
obligation
is
relieved.
in
fact
i
think
that's
what
largely
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
this
is
one
of
the
provisions,
mr.
justice
stewart,
which
might
very
well,
under
a
fair
reading
of
the
agreement
you
might
decide
that
they
don't
have
to
abide
by
apprentice
ratios
during
a
situation
where
there
is
a
shortage
of
manpower.
that's
just
--
that
wouldn't
only
be
a
strike
exception.
it
might
occur
if
there
was
some
other
natural
disaster
which
prevented
them
from
getting
the
proper
ratios.
the
union
in
this
case
has
never
seek
--
the
carrier
in
this
case
has
never
suggested
that
this
--
that
this
is
what
they
want
to
do,
make
these
deviations
which
are
absolutely
necessary
because
it's
impossible
to
comply
with
the
other
terms.
they've
never
suggested
that
nor
they
suggested
that
such
deviations
would
be
possible
under
the
contrary.
we
know
mr.
justice
stewart
that
in
this
industry
it
is
common
place
to
bargain
about
what
you
do
during
emergencies
including
strikes.
they're
the
provisions
and
the
agreements
in
this
case
which
provided
during
a
strike
when
manpower
short
they
can
layoff
people
more
quickly,
they
can
--
than
they
can
do
it
otherwise.
our
position
is
that
one,
the
railroads
are
perfectly
free
to
bargain
about
changing
apprentice
ratios
when
there
are
manpower
shortages
and
if
they
want
to
do
it
they
should.
secondly,
even
if
they
haven't
bargained
about
it,
so
it's
not
explicit
in
the
act,
we
agree
that
it's
open
to
them
to
assert
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
agreement
would
permit
some
deviation
in
that
regard.
they
have
never
argued
that
in
this
case
and
the
case
simply
doesn't
come
to
this
court
in
that
posture
if
they
had
argued
it,
it
might
be
a
different
situation,
just
carrying
out
a
bit
further.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
they
had
made
such
an
argument
that
certain
changes
are
permissible
under
a
fair
reading
of
the
agreement
then
it
would
be
up
to
the
union
to
decide
whether
they
would
agree
or
not
that
the
agreement
permitted
that.
if
the
union
agreed
of
course
there
would
be
no
problem.
if
the
union
disagreed,
then
you'd
have
a
dispute
about
the
meaning
of
the
contract
and
that's
the
dispute
which
in
our
view
is
subject
to
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
railroad
adjustment
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
know
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
know.
i
think
in
the
past
it
may
have
been
that
unions
and
i
think
it's
not
at
all
fanciful
to
assume
that
they
would
in
the
future,
agree
to
some
things
like
that.
for
example,
to
the
use
of
supervisors
to
run
trains,
i'm
not
sure
at
all
that
unions
would
suggest
that
the
use
of
supervisors
to
engage
in
limited
operation
of
trains
when
ordinary
working
people
were
not
available
to
do
so
would
constitute
a
violation
of
the
agreements.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
they
could
so
suggest.
but
in
any
case,
it's
not
at
all
clear
to
me
that
the
unions
would
take
that
position.
in
any
case,
if
the
carrier
hasn't
urged
it
here,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
i
don't
think
that
question
arises.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
i
did.
mr.
paul
bender
oh,
i
--
excuse
me.
they
had
to
follow
the
contract
insofar
as
it
had
not
been
--
mr.
paul
bender
--
exhausted
or
excuse
me.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
but
it
does
--
it's
not
as
much
as
you
might
think
mr.
justice
white
because
--
mr.
paul
bender
right,
exactly.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
right
and
if
they
propose
a
25%
--
mr.
paul
bender
i'm
sorry.
i
stand
corrected.
they
didn't
have
to
pay
precisely
what
was
in
the
contract.
they
could
deviate
insofar
as
it
had
been
through
bargaining,
but
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
as
a
general
proposition,
when
you
hire
replacements
during
a
strike,
if
the
strike
hasn't
occurred
over
a
wage
dispute
then
you
do
have
to
pay
the
wage
rates
that
you
can
find
in
the
agreement.
mr.
paul
bender
you
mean
in
the
contract
negotiation?
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
they
suggest
a
decrease.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
think
it
decreases,
no.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
think
so,
no.
i
think
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
paul
bender
it's
hard
to
talk
about
in
those
terms
because
the
fundamental
thing
that
they
did
when
they
hired
replacement
was
to
totally
ignore
corrupt
lines.
they
disregarded
the
fact
that
one
man
is
a
machinist
and
another
man
is
something
else.
now,
the
collective
bargaining
wage
rates
as
i
understand
it,
framed
in
terms
of
craft
lines.
so
it's
very
hard
to
know
when
they
pay
people
under
their
system
which
ignores
the
craft
lines
whether
or
not
they
are
abiding
in
dollar
in
sense
terms
by
the
--
by
the
wage
rates
provided
in
the
agreement.
i
do
think
that
they
--
to
some
extent
at
least
abandoned
the
hourly
system
of
compensation
and
attempted
to
compensate
them
on
a
weekly
or
monthly
basis
which
is
contradictory
to
the
terms
provided
in
the
agreement,
but
the
fundamental
thing
they
did
in
hiring
replacements
which
affects
everything
else,
seniority,
wage
rates,
and
everything
else,
is
to
completely
wipe
out
the
craft
line.
i
think
the
first
provision
in
these
conditions
of
employment
is
employees
have
to
do
whatever
work
they're
qualified
to
do
and
whatever
work
they
carry
that
calls
upon.
and
then
that's
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
way
the
whole
industry
had
been
organizing
that
to
--
up
to
that
time.
well,
let's
just
finish
the
story.
after
they
had
--
after
they
had
done
this.
they
finally
propose
to
the
--
to
the
unions
some
months
later
that
these
unilateral
changes
they
had
made
be
made
permanent
unilateral
changes
by
filing
a
notice
under
the
act
to
negotiate
about
the
permanent
institution
of
these
changes
with
the
union.
this
was
after
they
had
implemented
them
already.
they
said
that
they
wanted
permanently
to
amend
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
to
do
this.
then
they
had
a
meeting
finally
with
the
union
about
this,
but
the
meeting
broke
up
because
the
carrier
insisted
on
having
a
court
reporter
at
present
to
take
that
on
a
negotiation
and
the
unions
refuse
to
bargain
under
those
circumstances.
the
union
then
took
the
next
statutory
step
and
invoked
the
services
of
the
mediation
board
about
this
dispute.
now,
this
is
a
different
dispute
from
the
wage
dispute.
this
is
the
dispute
about
whether
that
all
the
carrier's
sweeping
changes,
abolition
of
craft
lines
et
cetera
should
be
permanently
--
should
permanently
replace
the
existing
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
they
both
did.
they
ma
--
the
meeting
broke
up
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
you
have
to
serve
a
notice
on
the
other
side,
setting
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
paul
bender
the
carriers
serve
the
notice
because
it
proposes
a
change.
the
carrier
has
to,
under
the
act,
served
the
notice
because
it
proposes
the
change.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
in
--
mr.
paul
bender
the
carrier
--
is
the
one
who
proposes
the
change
that
has
to
and
in
this
case
it
was
the
carrier
that
was
proposing
a
change.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
the
mediation
board
docketed
this
dispute
for
mediation.
the
carriers
said
you
can't
do
that
because
the
unions
forfeited
its
right
to
mediate
or
to
engage
in
any
of
the
other
statutory
procedures
because
it
walk
out
on
that
meeting
because
of
the
court
reporter
and
the
mediation
board
said
“that
was
not
a
refusal
to
bargain
because
you
had
not
right
to
bargain
with
the
court
report.”
the
carrier
ignored
that
--
ignored
the
fact
that
the
mediation
board
has
docketed
the
dispute
and
went
right
ahead
and
permanently
instituted
these
changes
which
it
had
sought
to
bargain
about
and
which
the
mediation
board
still
wanted
it
to
bargain
about.
it
was
at
this
stage
that
the
united
states
initiated
the
present
litigation.
in
our
view
by
permanently
implementing
this
working
agreement
proposal,
despite
the
mediation
board's
decision
to
docket
the
dispute,
to
carrier
is
directly
violating
act
and
it's
completely
undercutting
the
board's
jurisdiction.
the
board
believes
and
we
thought
correctly
the
meaningful
mediation
that
carriers'
proposals
would
be
entirely
frustrated
by
the
carriers
having
already
implemented
those
proposals.
in
addition,
the
previous
action
of
the
carrier
and
just
acting
unilaterally
with
regard
to
its
employees
was
in
our
view
completely,
a
flagrant
violation
of
the
act.
to
our
knowledge,
no
carrier
previously
had
ever
contended
that
it
could
do
such
a
thing
and
we
thought
it
was
important
to
vindicate
the
act
in
the
face
of
these
action
as
means
of
maintaining
good
faith
bargaining
in
our
labor
industry
and
we
would
--
normally
we
are
mindful
in
doing
this
that
the
railroad
involves
survival
defense
installations
of
cape
of
kennedy
and
surrounding
areas
and
that
prolongation
or
intensification
of
this
dispute
might
very
well
have
consequences,
adverse
consequences
on
the
government's
programs
there.
plus
it's
also
a
standing
in
this
action
the
practical
standing
close
from
the
considerations
that
i've
just
said.
the
legal
basis
for
the
standing
i
think
that
flow
from
those
directly
with
--
it's
not
necessary
in
any
event
because
section
2
tenth
of
the
act,
it
seems
to
us
clearly,
gives
the
united
states
standing
to
initiate
an
action
such
as
this
and
that's
what
we've
got.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
agreed.
well,
the
district
court
as
i've
said
ultimately
after
the
court
of
appeals
rendered
this
decision
about
reasonably
necessary
changes
which
was
rendered
not
in
this
case
but
in
a
companion
case,
the
trainmen
case,
the
district
court
permitted
this
four
minor
such
changes
of
--
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
these
petitions
have
--
have
followed.
now,
let
me
talk
first
about
the
carriers'
argument
namely,
that
once
a
strike
has
occurred,
it
can
run
its
employee
relationships
entirely
as
it
wishes.
it
has
not
duty
to
bargain
with
anyone
about
employee
conditions
and
it
has
no
duty
to
abide
by
any
collective
agreements.
employees
hired
during
the
strike
are
treated
by
the
carrier
the
way
the
carrier
wants
to
treat
them
and
that
this
situation
continues
as
long
as
the
strike
continues.
now
this
argument
is
--
has
been
squarely
rejected
under
the
national
labors
relations
act.
fec
is
to
our
knowledge
that
first
carried
an
urgent
--
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
we
just
see
no
basis
for
it
under
the
railway
labor
act
especially
in
light
of
the
much
more
explicit
provisions
of
that
act
about
the
duty
to
bargain
and
about
the
fact
that
the
duty
to
bargain
clearly
includes
the
obligation
to
adhere
to
existing
collective
bargaining
agreements.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
they
do
it.
they
--
mr.
paul
bender
they
now
take
the
position
--
florida
east
coast
as
we
believe
the
only
first
carrier
who
had
taken
the
position.
they
took
it
in
this
case
and
the
amicus
brief
supports
(voice
overlap)
mr.
paul
bender
it
is
now
the
position
having
been
taken
by
florida
east
coast.
we
are
unaware
that
the
position
had
ever
been
taken
before.
it
annoys
it
--
a
matter
merely
of
the
language
of
the
act
which
i
emphasize
is
clearly
against
the
carriers'
position.
as
has
been
recognized
under
national
labors
relations
act
suspension
of
the
duty
to
bargain
during
a
strike
would
substantially
destroy
the
process
of
collective
bargaining
under
the
--
under
the
act.
it
doesn't
take
an
awful
lot
of
imagination
to
see
how
that
works.
for
example,
one
duty
which
clearly
continues
during
a
strike
is
the
duty
to
settle
the
dispute
which
led
to
the
strike,
that's
the
thing
the
act
once
settled,
that's
the
wage
and
notice
dispute
in
this
case.
you
can't
very
meaningfully
expect
the
union
and
the
carrier
to
settle
a
dispute
when
the
carrier
asserts
the
right
to
violate
all
its
agreements
with
the
union.
that
kind
of
violation
of
the
contract
where
the
party
was
doing
a
bargain,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
the
antithesis
of
meaningful
collective
bargaining.
also,
and
this
is
a
little
more
settled
but
i
don't
think
it's
difficult
to
see
how
it
occurs,
if
you
give
the
carrier
this
right
to
do
whatever
it
wants,
once
the
strike
occurs,
it
makes
the
pressure
of
the
strike
to
encourage
people
to
engage
in
the
collective
bargaining
really
[inaudible].
when
the
strike
occurs,
it's
a
--
it
may
well
be
a
good
thing
for
the
carrier
or
often
the
bad
thing
for
the
carrier.
they
do
whatever
they
want.
they
institute
the
most
sweeping
changes
and
they
say
to
the
union,
“you
strike
as
long
as
you
want.
as
long
as
you
strike,
we
will
run
a
totally
unrepresented
shop.
we
will
deal
with
our
employees
however
we
want”
and
they
can
go
further
as
the
carrier
went
in
this
case,
they
can
propose
once
they've
got
these
changes
instituted,
they
can
propose
to
keep
them
there
permanently
and
file
this
section
6
notices
to
permanently
change
throw
out
all
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
to
run
the
shop
on
their
own
terms
and
again,
they
sit
back.
they
don't
negotiate
meaningfully
over
that.
they
can
keep
their
proposals
in
effect
as
long
as
the
strike
continues
and
when
the
negotiations
finally
fail
on
their
long
range
proposals
they
can
amend
the
collective
bargaining
agreements.
now
you
just,
you
cannot
have
meaningful
collective
bargaining
in
these
circumstances
if
the
union
knows
that
as
soon
as
strikes
and
the
strike
is
the
only
way
that
the
union
has
of
trying
to
enforce
its
demands
after
negotiations
breaks
down,
you
cannot
have
meaningful
collective
bargaining
if
the
union
has
been
taking
the
choice
between
giving
up
the
shop,
giving
up
its
power
to
represent
the
employees
in
striking.
if
it
strikes
it
just
is
out
completely.
the
carrier
runs
the
shop
as
it
wishes
and
the
union
just
ultimately
capitulates.
excuse
me?
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
and
in
this
case
the
union
agreed
--
mr.
paul
bender
to
arbitrary
involvement.
at
three
different
occasions
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
that's
the
dispute
agreed
to
arbitrary
on
three
different
occasions.
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
on
april
3rd,
may
17th,
and
october
14th,
1963,
the
union
agreed.
it
initially
refused
to
arbitrate.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
but
then
it
later
agreed
to
--
it
agreed
to
arbitration
and
certainly
either
side
may
agree
to
arbitration
mr.
justice
white
but
the
union
can
--
in
those
sense
compelled
arbitration.
if
it
agrees
and
the
carrier
disagrees
it
still
has
the
strike
and
that
its
only
--
its
only
remaining
possible
economic
lever
that
it
can
use
and
in
this
case
the
carrier
refused
to
arbitrate
and
i
think
--
mr.
paul
bender
you
mean
the
broad
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
know
there
were
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
don't
know
--
your
impressions
that
all
the
carriers
agreed
to
arbitrate
and
the
unions
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
know
about
that.
what
i
know
is
true
is
that
after
the
presidential
board
was
created
and
it
recommended
the
solution,
that
solution
was
adopted
by
all
the
unions
and
carriers
except
the
florida
east
coast.
now,
i
think
it's
been
the
union's
position,
or
at
least
it
was
the
unions'
position
at
that
time
that
they
were
willing
to
adopt
that
solution.
so
in
the
sense
they
were
willing
to
adopt
what
amounted
to
in
arbitration
(voice
overlap)
mr.
paul
bender
but
it's
an
impartial
recommendation.
mr.
paul
bender
yes
--
well,
now
let
me
turn
into
--
mr.
paul
bender
no
mr.
justice
fortas.
i'm
afraid
i
didn't
make
it
clear
what
i
meant
to
say.
it
seems
to
me
to
one
extent
i
agree
with
you.
whatever
the
union
is
willing
to
agree
–
mr.
paul
bender
but
i
don't
agree
--
i
don't
agree
that
they
have
the
right
to
violate
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
my
position
was
that
they
have
the
right
to
assert
certain
deviations
from
the
literal
language
of
the
agreement
is
not
a
violation
of
the
agreement.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
it's
very
important
--
mr.
paul
bender
no
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
paul
bender
i
didn't
--
i
suggest
that
they
might
be
able
to
make
deviations
but
not
in
violation
of
the
agreement.
my
only
suggestion
was
that
there
is
flexibility
in
these
agreements.
they
ought
to
be
read
realistically
in
light
of
situations
and
in
light
perhaps
of
unanticipated
situation
and
if
you
assume
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
agreement
might
permit
some
deviations
from
the
literal
term
that
we
concede
they
might
be
able
to
do,
that's
all.
mr.
paul
bender
did
you
say
to
hire
them
or
to
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
they
cannot
do
that.
mr.
paul
bender
because
it's
a
violation
of
the
existing
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
railway
labor
act
--
mr.
paul
bender
no,
i
didn't.
if
i
did,
i
didn't
mean
to.
what
i
meant
to
say
that
they
may
not
violate
the
agreement.
they
may
or
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice
fortas
maybe
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
it
does.
i
doubt
very
much
whether
it
does
that.
let
me
put
--
mr.
paul
bender
our
answer
to
that
is
that
they
may
not
recruit
in
violation
of
the
agreement.
what
i
did
try
to
say
was
that
they
may
urge
that
certain
recruiting
practices
not
explicitly
provided
in
the
agreement
are
not
a
violation
because
of
unusual
circumstances.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
our
position
is
that
if
they
make
such
a
contention
and
if
the
union
disagrees
with
the
construction
of
the
agreement
that
is
a
dispute
about
the
meaning
of
the
agreement
which
the
act
commits
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board,
not
to
the
district
court
and
that
the
dispute
should
primarily
be
taken
there.
now
that
doesn't
come
up
here
because
the
railroad
has
never
suggested
that
the
things
it
wants
to
do
are
permissible
under
a
fair
reading
of
the
agreement.
to
sum
up
the
position
that
i
have
mr.
justice
fortas
suppose
that
the
agreement
said
at
the
very
end
in
capital
letters
“and
these
provisions
shall
not
be
varied
in
the
slightest
because
of
the
existence
of
a
lawful
strike,”
there
is
no
question
in
our
mind
that
that
agreement
should
be
applied
as
written
and
it
was
not
very
unusual.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
exactly.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
and
that
they
can
bargain
for
that
in
advance
and
get
those
flexible
provisions
in
the
agreement
or
if
they
wish,
if
they
think
what
they've
bargained
for
prevents
them
totally
from
running
during
the
strike
and
that
that
is
an
impossible
situation,
they
can
agree
to
arbitrate
the
dispute
and
thereby
and
i
think
the
union
will
develop
this
argument.
avoid
these
constricting
procedures
of
the
railroad
labor
--
mr.
paul
bender
well
it's
--
it
is
because
we
do
take
that
by
position
and
one
other
reason
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
does
not
flow
from
the
agreement.
it
flows
from
the
right
to
operate
--
mr.
paul
bender
the
need
to
operate.
i
think
that
all
decisions
--
mr.
paul
bender
all
decisions
in
this
area
have
to
flow
from
the
agreements.
that's
what
the
railway
labor
act
requires.
i
will
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
argument
of
mr.
--
mr.
paul
bender
that's
a
question
which
has
never
been
presented
or
decided
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
bender
not
explicitly,
no.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
that
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
that
if
the
railroad
suggested
that
that
did
not
violate
the
agreement
it
is
quite
a
likely
possibility
that
the
union
might
agree,
that
the
use
of
supervisory
personnel
when
they
didn't
replace
any
personnel
covered
by
the
agreement
would
not
amount
to
a
violation
of
the
agreement.
but
the
agreement
merely
says
--
mr.
paul
bender
they
don't
here,
but
if
they
did,
the
union
might
agree.
mr.
paul
bender
that
is
the
question
--
of
the
meaning
of
the
contract
which
so
far
as
i
know
mr.
chief
justice
is
never
going
to
be
authoritatively
decided
and
all
i'm
saying
is
that
i'd
like
to
know
the
answer.
mr.
paul
bender
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
i
meant
to
suggest
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
probably
misspoke
myself
and
i
apologize.
what
i
meant
to
suggest
was
that
they
might
be
able
to
urge
that
the
use
of
supervisors
would
not
violate
the
agreement
and
that
the
union
might
concede
or
that
the
railroad
adjustment
board
might
agree
with
them.
if
that
were
true
and
i
think
it's
quite
possible
that
it
is,
that
would
provide
a
certain
amount
of
flexibility.
the
history
supports
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
occasions
on
which
railroads
have
operated
during
strikes
have
been
mostly
with
supervisors.
and
i
don't
know,
i'm
not
aware
that
unions
have
strongly
suggested
in
those
cases
that
that
amounted
to
a
violation
of
the
agreement.
it's
quite
possible
that
the
general
positions
unions
would
take
is
that
that
does
not
amount
to
a
violation.
my
argument
is
that
that's
what
the
railroad
should
have
done
here.
they
should
have
urged
that
they
could
engage
in
operation
under
the
agreement
and
they
should
have
attempted
to
engage
in
operation
under
the
agreement
and
that
the
act
provides
all
panoply
of
procedures
for
deciding
any
questions
about
what
the
agreement
means
in
that
context,
but
the
carrier
did
wrong
here
was
to
ignore
the
agreement.
it
never
attempted
to
comply
with
it
and
their
position
in
this
court
is
just
that
and
boldly
that
because
they
don't
have
to
make
any
attempt
to
comply
with
their
agreements
during
a
strike.
that
is
what
we
say
is
wrong,
that
complete
negation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
paul
bender
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
i
have
about
nine
or
ten
minutes
left
and
i
understood
under
the
arrangement
that
we
had
that
the
rebuttal
would
be
15,
i
will
try
to
compress
it
within
the
time
left
so
i
will
move
fairly
fast.
i
think
that
at
this
time
of
the
oral
argument,
the
point
that
we
would
like
to
address
ourselves
to
right
at
the
initial
outset
is
where
what
has
been
conceded
by
both
sides
does
the
exception
to
the
railway
labor
act
spring
from.
where
did
the
court
of
appeals
find
the
basis
for
creating
the
doctrine
which
is
under
review
here,
the
so-called
doctrine
of
reasonably
necessary
exceptions
to
the
railway
labor
act?
i
think
everybody
concedes
the
fec,
the
association
of
american
railroads,
the
government
and
the
unions,
that
what
was
done
here
by
the
fec
could
not
have
been
done
but
for
strike
conditions.
and
the
plain
categorical
language
of
section
2
seventh
of
the
railway
labor
act
makes
this
clear.
and
i
would
like
to
refer
to
that,
it
hasn't
been
mentioned
in
so
many
words
and
it's
very
short
and
it's
very
clear.
and
it
says
“no
carrier,
its
officers
or
agents
shall
change
the
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions
of
each
employees
as
a
class
as
embodied
in
agreement
except
in
the
manner
prescribed
in
such
agreements
or
in
section
156
namely
section
6
of
the
act.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
had
said
that
doesn't
apply
because
of
strike
conditions
because
it
bears
too
heavily,
too
hard
on
the
railroad
under
strike
conditions.
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
refer
to
any
language
in
the
act
to
support
this
exception.
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
refer
to
any
legislative
history
to
support
this
exception
and
we
submit
that
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
contended
that
it
bears
too
heavily
on
the
carrier
faced
with
the
strike
conditions
is
not
in
law
sufficient
to
create
the
exception
here
found
to
exist
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
there
are
three
basic
positions
in
this
case.
one
position
is
that
the
act
applies
under
strike
conditions
just
as
it
applies
when
there
are
no
strike
conditions.
that
is
the
government's
position,
that
is
our
position.
the
other
position
is
the
position
of
the
american
association
of
railroads
and
the
fec
that
under
strike
conditions
even
though
it
may
be
with
just
one
union
this
gives
the
railroad
the
legal
right
as
mr.
devaney
referred
to
it
to
totally
suspend
all
of
its
contracts
with
all
of
its
crafts,
in
this
case
there
are
21
different
crafts,
21
different
contracts.
that
is
the
counter
position.
in
between
the
court
of
appeals
who
said
“no,
you
cannot
totally
suspend
the
provisions
of
the
act,
but
we
will
permit
an
application,
the
railroad
to
come
in,
in
the
nature
of
equitable
relief
and
seek
certain
limited
exceptions
where
it
makes
a
showing
that
it
is
reasonably
necessary
for
the
railroad
to
do
so
in
order
to
operate
under
strike
conditions.
we
say
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
wrong
because
it
spins
out
of
the
whole
clock
an
exception
into
the
railway
labor
act
which
readjusts
the
economic
balance
struck
by
that
act
by
congress.
we
say
that
the
position
of
the
railroad
is
wrong
because
it
is
far
more
extreme
and
even
the
limited
exception
or
gloss
put
on
the
act
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
because
the
only
actions
of
the
railroad
in
this
case
shows
that
there
has
never
been
an
understanding
either
in
the
industry
or
by
this
particular
carrier
that
contracts
are
totally
suspended
under
strike
conditions.
three
concessions
have
been
made
by
counsel
for
the
railroad
in
this
case
which
are
totally
inconsistent
with
any
idea
of
contracts
or
the
act
being
suspended
during
a
strike.
one
is
that
the
strikers
earned
seniority.
how
can
they
earn
seniority
if
the
contracts
are
suspended?
one
is
the
grievances
maybe
processed
during
the
strike
as
they
are
being
done
on
the
property
today.
how
can
you
have
grievances
if
the
act
or
the
contracts
are
totally
suspended?
the
third
is,
if
the
union
is
the
representative
of
the
replacements
--
well,
how
can
that
be
if
the
act
or
the
contracts
are
suspended?
and
we
would
like
to
point
to
something
which
we
think
is
even
more
clearly
about
what
the
understanding
of
this
particular
carrier
and
the
railroad
industry
is
generally
and
that
is
the
section
6
proposals
involved
in
this
very
case.
the
proposals
made
by
the
carrier
in
september
of
1963,
eight
or
nine
months
after
this
strike
began
and
i
would
like
to
refer
to
page
44
of
the
exhibit
record
where
one
of
those
section
6
notices
is
set
forth,
and
page
254
--
excuse
me,
page
416
of
the
exhibit
record
where
another
of
those
section
6
proposals
is
set
forth
and
this
is
what
they
say.
they
say
“article
3,
“we
propose
a
bargain
with
you
about
putting
in
to
our
collective
bargaining
contract
article
3
entitled
work
stoppages.”
and
then
it
goes
on
and
there's
a
full
paragraph
here
in
which
it
sets
out
contract
provisions
that
would
govern
during
work
stoppages.
now,
how
is
this
consistent
with
any
idea
that
the
contracts
or
the
act
are
totally
suspended
under
the
act?
we
submit
your
honor
that
the
whole
process
of
the
railway
labor
act,
the
whole
scheme
of
it
is
to
take
disputes
and
narrowly
confine
and
refine
and
define
them
to
the
point
where
they
become
confined
rather
than
expanded.
this
dispute
started
out
as
a
very
simple
wage
dispute.
it
got
down
to
the
point
where
the
difference
between
the
parties
was
only
10
cents
an
hour.
it
now
involves
literally
every
single
rule,
rate
of
pay,
and
working
condition
in
21
different
contracts
on
the
entire
property.
that's
how
the
--
mr.
paul
bender
that's
correct
your
honor,
but
what
they
did
here
and
what
the
record
shows
they
did,
they
put
in
these
conditions
of
employment
the
so-called
strike
imposed
conditions
of
employment,
they
said
they
were
only
to
be
temporary
but
actually
what
they
did,
they
put
those
in,
they
codified
them
and
written
for
them
on
september
1,
three
weeks
later,
september
24
--
september
25,
they
issued
section
6
notices
which
are
substantially
the
same
saying
“we
want
this
as
the
permanent
change.”
in
other
words,
what
has
happened
here
is
that
the
whole
issue
has
expanded
to
the
point
where
the
mediators
involved,
labor
department
throw
up
their
hands.
i
think
that's
the
reason
the
government
is
in
this
suit
is
because
the
whole
process
of
mediation
of
existing
disputes
once
a
strike
exists
is
completely
frustrated
both
by
the
doctrine
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
doctrine
asserted
by
the
carriers
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
bender
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
correct
your
honor.
now
that's
the
difference.
that's
the
--
these
airline
cases,
these
eastern
airline
case
for
example
as
the
first
of
them
shows
by
judge
feinberg,
the
changes
made
by
eastern
airlines
were
within
the
scope
of
its
section
6
notice,
so
there
had
been
bargaining
on
that
--
on
that
issue
and
the
procedures
of
the
act
had
been
exhausted.
eastern
airlines
never
attempted
to
operate
contrary
to
an
existing
contract.
the
question
in
that
case
was
which
contract
governed?
it
was
a
jurisdictional
dispute
but
it
--
eastern
the
carrier
there
always
operated
in
conformity
with
an
existing
contract.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
paul
bender
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
three
petitions
arise
from
a
single
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
that
decision
affirmed
in
an
injunction
entered
in
the
middle
district
of
florida,
in
action
brought
by
the
united
states
against
the
florida
east
coast
railway
to
enjoin
what
we
allege
to
be
violations
of
the
railway
labor
act.
eleven
unions
representing
nonoperating
employees
of
the
florida
east
coast
railway
intervened
in
the
district
court
in
support
of
the
injunction
and
participated
in
the
court
of
appeals.
one
of
the
petitions
here
has
been
filed
by
the
united
states,
thats
number
782.
one,
taking
essentially
the
same
position
has
been
filed
by
the
unions,
that's
number
750
and
the
third
which
is
a
cross
petition
has
been
filed
by
the
carriers,
that's
number
783.
for
purposes
of
the
oral
argument,
i
shall
present
the
argument
in
chief
for
the
position
jointly
taken
by
the
unions
and
by
the
unites
states.
mr.
devaney
will
then
argue
for
the
carrier
and
mr.
rutledge
representing
the
unions
will
present
a
rebuttal
argument
for
the
position
which
the
unions
and
the
united
states
jointly
take.
the
issue
here
essentially
is
a
simple
one.
the
question
is
where
and
to
what
extent
carriers
covered
by
the
railway
labor
act
must
obey
first
their
duty
to
bargain
with
the
representatives
of
their
employees
and
secondly,
their
duty
to
adhere
to
existing
collective
bargaining
agreements
which
they
have
previously
made
with
those
representatives.
during
the
course
of
a
lawful
strike,
the
unites
states
takes
the
position
that
both
of
those
duties
remain
upon
the
carrier
during
the
course
of
a
lawful
strike.
it
must
both
bargain
with
the
representatives
of
its
employees
and
it
must
adhere
to
collective
bargaining
agreements
which
continue
to
exist
during
the
course
of
that
strike.
the
carrier,
on
the
other
hand,
takes
the
position
that
it
is
under
neither
those,
that
it
must
neither
bargain
nor
adhere
to
existing
collective
bargaining
agreements.
let
me
briefly
sketch
to
the
court
the
statutory
scheme
which
maybe
somewhat
unfamiliar
under
which
these
issues
arise.
in
the
first
place,
like
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
railway
labor
act
contains
a
general
duty
to
bargain
between
employers
and
the
representatives
of
their
employees.
it
goes
a
little
bit
further
in
general
than
the
railway
--
than
the
national
labors
relations
act,
however,
in
providing
rather
affirmatively
that
there's
a
duty
of
all
carriers
to
exert
every
reasonable
effort
to
make
and
maintain
agreements
concerning
rates
of
pay
rules
and
working
conditions
and
to
settle
all
disputes
arising
out
of
those
agreements
with
the
representatives
of
their
employee.
there's
nothing
like
that
that
explicit
in
the
national
labors
relations
act
about
the
duty
to
make
and
maintain
agreements
and
of
course
a
continuing
duty
to
bargain
with
the
representatives.
then
the
act
becomes
much
more
explicit
than
the
national
labors
relations
act
and
much
more
absolute
in
describing
the
meaning
of
the
duty
to
bargain,
“once
agreements
have
been
reached
with
the
representatives
of
employees,
as
agreements
had
been
reached
in
this
case,
first
the
act
provides
that
when
either
the
carrier
or
the
union
wishes
to
change
existing
agreements
covering
rates
of
pay
rules
or
working
conditions
notice
must
be
served
on
the
other
party
and
negotiations
between
the
parties
undertaken.
if
these
negotiations
fail
to
result
in
agreements
either
party
may
then
invoke
the
services
of
the
national
mediation
board
which
is
created
primarily
for
that
purpose,
to
mediate
disputes
which
haven't
been
settled
by
a
negotiation
or
the
mediation
board
may
itself
proffer
its
services
even
if
the
parties
don't
ask
it
to.
if
this
mediation
fails,
the
board,
the
mediation
board,
is
then
directed
to
encourage
the
parties
to
submit
to
the
dispute
to
binding
arbitration,
although
it
can't
compel
the
parties
to
do
so.”
if
one
or
both
of
the
parties
refuses
arbitration
and
there's
another
step,
the
last
resort
you
can
create
a
presidential
commission,
an
emergency
board
it's
called,
to
recommend
the
solution
to
the
dispute
and
again
its
recommendations
aren't
binding.
and
--
mr.
paul
bender
right.
i
think
the
mediation
board
has
some
rule
in
making
recommendations
for
the
president
but
of
course
the
president
does
not
have
to
appoint
the
board.
in
thus
providing
these
detailed
procedures
which
don't
have
any
direct
parallel
in
national
labors
relations
act,
the
act
provides
as
explicitly
as
one
can
imagine
that
existing
conditions,
those
subject
to
the
dispute,
those
that
one
party
or
the
other
wants
to
change
must
not
be
changed
by
the
carrier
while
these
negotiations,
the
mediation,
the
arbitration
or
if
there's
an
emergency
board,
the
emergency
board
is
acting,
while
these
procedures
are
in
progress,
you
may
not
change
the
existing
conditions.
then
there's
a
general
provision
which
again
provides
as
explicitly
as
you
can
imagine,
that
you
cannot
make
changes
without
entering
into
these
statutory
procedures.
that
provision,
section
2
seventh
of
the
act,
provides
that
unless
the
statutory
from
the
negotiation
procedures
are
undertaken,
no
carrier,
its
officers,
agents
or
agent
shall
change
the
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions
of
it's
employees
as
a
class
as
embodied
in
agreements.
thus,
it
seems
to
us
quite
clear
and
i
don't
think
anyone
disagrees
with
this,
that
the
duty
to
bargain
under
the
railway
labor
act
is
defined
in
part
and
perhaps
its
most
essential
part,
as
the
duty
to
adhere
to
existing
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
not
to
change
those
agreements
for
employees
as
a
class
not
the
institute
what
would
amount
to
amendments
or
changes
without
bargaining
with
the
representatives
of
the
employees.
at
the
same
time
as
the
carrier
thus
found
there
is
a
similar
rule
that
applies
to
unions
requiring
the
maintenance
of
existing
agreements
while
these
statutory
procedures
are
in
progress.
thus,
when
a
union
for
example
is
engaged
in
a
wage
dispute
with
a
carrier,
it
may
not
strike
on
to
and
i
think
everyone
agrees
with
this,
although
this
is
not
as
explicit
in
the
act,
it
may
not
strike
until
it
has
exhausted
the
statutory
procedures
just
as
the
carrier
may
not
unilaterally
change
the
wages
until
it's
exhausted
the
procedures
are
the
carrier
can
engage
in
a
lockout
until
the
procedures
have
been
exhausted.
when
the
procedures
are
exhausted
without
a
solution
being
reached,
then
and
only
then
may
the
union
strike
to
achieve
its
aims
of
proposal,
and
then
and
only
then
may
the
carrier
implement
the
changes
which
it
proposes
without
first
exhausting
the
statutory
procedures,
both
parties
have
to
stand
by
existing
agreements.
that's
what
the
act
provides
and
i
can
imagine
that
it
could
do
so
anymore
clearly.
now,
it's
--
as
i
said
i
think
it's
conceded
that
those
provisions
as
i've
described
them
are
applicable
in
the
ordinary
situation.
the
question
here
is,
and
also
let
me
put
that
they
are
enforceable
by
injunction.
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
that
any
longer.
there
once
was
a
question
whether
the
norris-laguardia
act
might
have
prevented
either
of
the
parties
from
enjoining
the
other
party.
that
is
no
longer
a
question
seriously
open
to
dispute.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
that
statutory
scheme
as
i
described,
it
remains
applicable
during
a
lawful
strike.
the
carrier
argues
that
those
provisions
do
not.
in
its
view,
when
a
strike
occurs
even
though
it's
a
lawful
strike,
it
is
entirely
free,
completely
free
to
implement
whatever
wages,
work
rules
or
working
conditions
it
desires
for
as
long
as
the
strike
continues.
and
that
it
doesn't
have
to
bargain
with
the
union
about
the
implementation
of
any
of
those
procedures
either
before
the
strike
or
during
the
strike.
as
far
as
it's
our
concerned,
the
strike
uses
a
complete
freedom
to
treat
its
employees
as
it
wishes
so
long
as
the
strike
continues
and
it
carriers
and
i
quote
from
it's
brief,
it
says
“it's
agreements
with
the
labor
organizations
were
suspended
during
the
period
of
the
strike
and
fec
was
not
required
even
to
attempt
to
comply
with.”
mr.
paul
bender
wages
and
a
notice
issue
also.
the
question
of
whether,
the
length
of
notice
you
had
to
give
before
layoffs
and
job
abolition.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
just
wages
and
that
no
decision,
correct.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
i'm
planning
to
get
into
this
in
a
minute,
but
yes,
that's
essentially
what
happened.
mr.
paul
bender
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
the
way
you
get
a
lawful
strike
in
the
industry.
let
me
say
that
now
--
mr.
paul
bender
exactly.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
right,
precisely.
now,
they
say
they
can
do
that.
we
say
that
they
have
got
to
adhere
to
their
agreements
as
written.
if
the
agreements
provide
for
what
they
can
do
during
a
strike
then
they
can
do
what
the
agreements
provide
for
what
they
can
do
during
the
strike.
mr.
paul
bender
under
the
act,
they
were.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
the
act
--
mr.
paul
bender
because
the
--
these
labor
organizations
were
they're
designated
--
had
been
the
designated
representatives
of
the
employees
in
those
classes.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
the
union
members
i
assume
were
all
out
on
strike,
at
least
most
of
them
were
but
under
the
act
there
had
never
been
a
new
designation
of
representatives
and
the
act
does
not
contain
any
provision.
i
think
this
is
quite
clear
which
provides
that
the
loss
of
representation
upon
the
union
losing
a
majority
of
the
employees
actually
working
at
that
time.
mr.
paul
bender
the
only
way
you
--
mr.
paul
bender
the
union
members
were
out
on
a
strike.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
but
the
act
--
the
union
still
represents
the
employees
in
that
class.
mr.
paul
bender
including
the
replacement.
mr.
paul
bender
surely.
mr.
paul
bender
we
--
we
believe
that
the
replacements
are
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
--
or
the
agreements
upon
negotiate
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
and
they
must.
it
--
it's
a
rule
which
is
for
their
benefit.
it's
a
rule
which
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
union
and
it's
a
rule
which
--
and
this
is
the
reason
we're
involved,
this
is
for
the
benefit
of
collective
bargaining
in
the
railway
industry
and
in
the
long
run
is
the
--
for
the
benefit
of
stable
labor
relationships.
but
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
union
doesn't
lose
its
status
as
bargaining
representative
simply
because
it
goes
out
on
strike.
that's
not
even
true
under
the
national
labors
relations
act
and
it's
certainly
isn't
true
under
this
act
where
there's
no
provision
provided
for
a
union
losing
its
representation
without
a
new
election,
without
a
new
representation
proceeding
being
commenced
and
that
has
never
happened
in
this
case.
now,
the
court
of
appeals,
in
all
of
these,
took
a
middle
brown
between
these
two
positions.
it
agreed
with
the
united
states
that
the
carrier
couldn't,
as
it
still
asserts
it
can
do,
completely
ignores
existing
agreements
and
ignore
the
union
because
the
union
is
out
on
strike.
the
court
did
however,
purport
to
write
a
new
gloss
into
the
act
and
it's
a
concededly
new
gloss
that
appears
nowhere
in
the
act
creating
an
exception
to
these
broad
prohibitions.
the
court
held
that
while
a
carrier
can
generally
change
its
collective
bargaining
agreements
during
the
strike,
it
can
institute
such
changes
in
these
agreements
and
--
as
are
and
i
quote
again,
“reasonably
necessary
to
effectuate
its
right
to
operate,
to
continue
to
run
its
railroad
under
strike
conditions.”
now,
we
think
this
gloss,
this
new
exception
while
it's
not
as
dangerous
to
collective
bargaining
and
it's
not
--
well,
it's
not
dangerous
to
collective
bargaining
as
the
rule
of
carriers
--
it
still
terribly
dangerous
to
bargaining
and
it's
still
contrary
to
the
terms
of
the
act
and
we
also
believe
that
there's
no
cause
for
it's
creation
at
this
time.
we're
frankly
concerned
here
to
overturn
this
principle
like
you
can
violate
collective
bargaining
agreements
during
a
strike
when
it's
necessary
to
operate
rather
than
its
application
in
this
case,
and
let
me
be
candid
about
that
now.
the
district
court
in
this
case
permitted
only
four
changes
under
this
exception
and
they
were
all
relatively
narrow
minor
changes.
if
that
were
all
that
were
going
to
happen
under
this
exception,
it
wouldn't
be
dangerous,
but
as
i
will
try
to
show
later,
we
think
its
potentialities
are
much
greater
and
there's
a
very
good
reason
for
getting
rid
of
this
now
because
the
difficulties
of
reviewing
these
broad
changes
in
the
future
when
they're
given
in
the
form
of
temporary
--
temporary
release
maybe
in
surmount
of.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
mr.
justice
brennan
it,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
suggested
that
it
arose
out
of
the
right
to
operate
of
a
railroad,
out
of
the
right
to
self-help
during
a
strike.
it
didn't
suggest
any
statutory
basis.
the
most
it
did
was
suggested
there
was
an
analogy
to
it
in
the
national
labors
relations
act.
we
don't
think
that's
true,
but
even
if
there
were,
we
think
the
railway
labor
act
as
i
tried
to
describe
it,
is
a
much
more
comprehensive
scheme
of
regulation
in
this
regard
and
the
terms
flatly
prohibit
any
changes.
and
that
if
you
are
going
to
have
an
exception,
you
shouldn't
upset
the
delicate
balance
of
power
in
the
industry
by
a
judicially
created
exception.
this
is
a
kind
of
thing
which
in
this
industry
which
congress
has
dealt
with
so
specifically
ought
to
come
from
congress.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
suggest
it
can
get
it
out
of
the
act
at
all.
mr.
paul
bender
it
came
from
the
right
of
a
carrier
to
operate.
it
thought
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
know.
they
didn't
suggest.
they
just
stay
with
the
--
mr.
paul
bender
no,
they
didn't
suggest
it
was
a
constitutional
right.
i
doubt
if
they
did
because
it
certainly
--
our
position
is
that
when
you
enter
into
an
agreement
the
effect
of
which
is
to
make
it
more
difficult
to
operate
during
a
strike
or
even
to
make
it
impossible
to
operate
during
a
strike,
you
may
have
agreed
a
way
you're
right
to
a
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
find
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
i
don't
see
where
it
could
be
found.
now
--
mr.
paul
bender
oh
no.
we
agree
that
the
railroad
--
there's
nothing
that
stops
the
railroad
from
attempting
to
operate.
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
--
that
operation
has
to
be
consistent
with
its
agreement.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
suppose
you
might
say
there's
an
abstract
right
of
a
railroad
operator
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
should
think
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
should
think
congress
might
be
able
to
modify
the
right
in
some
circumstances.
they
clearly
haven't
-
mr.
paul
bender
they
might
have
a
duty
to
operate
as
a
common
carrier
under
the
state
law
but
not,
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
violation
of
the
railway
labor
act.
i
think
if
those
two
things
come
into
collision,
there's
no
question
that
the
railway
labor
act
has
got
to
be
paramount.
same
--
the
same
sort
of
question
arises.
suppose
they
can
only
operate
in
an
unsafe
manner
which
would
violate
federal
safety
regulations
that
the
state
may
impose
upon
them
the
duty
to
operate
as
a
common
carrier
but
they
certainly
don't
have
the
duty
to
operate
in
violation
of
federal
safety
regulations.
and
we
say
they
don't
have
the
duty
to
operate
in
violation
of
the
law.
mr.
paul
bender
i
suppose
there
is
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
suppose
a
common
carrier
with
a
certificate
would
have
to
attempt
to
operate
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
but
certainly
if
it
was
prevented
from
doing
so
by
a
strike
because
railroads
generally
are
prevented
from
operating
during
a
strike,
there
would
be
no
violation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
clearly
i
think
that
you
can't
read
either
of
those
duties
as
carte
blanche
just
ignored
other
duties
under
the
railway
labor
act
including
the
duty
to
bargain.
in
the
long
run
that
sort
of
thing
is
much
more
detrimental
to
the
passage
of
interstate
commerce.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
railway
labor
act
was
because
labor
disputes
which
were
not
settled
amicably
has
been
causing
terrible
disruptions
to
commerce.
now,
if
you
say
that
you
can
forget
about
the
amicable
solution
of
labor
disputes
in
order
to
permit
carriers
to
operate
that's
going
to
boomerang
and
you
will
get
--
and
it's
congress'
choice,
it's
not
something
i'm
making
off,
i'm
asking
the
court
to
make
up.
that's
the
choice
that
congress
has
made.
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
that's
the
choice
of
this
court
has
got
to
enforce.
now,
let
me,
although
it
comes
rather
late,
let
me
go
through
these
issues
again
fairly
quickly
in
the
context
of
the
facts
here.
they
may
become
a
bit
clearer.
in
1961,
11
nonoperating
unions,
those
were
the
unions
representing
people
who
don't
actually
run
the
trains
like
clerks
and
machinists
which
had
had
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
all
of
the
large
railroads
in
the
country
for
a
number
of
years,
served
notice
upon
all
these
railroads
including
the
florida
east
coast
railroad
that
they
desired
a
25
cent
an
hour
wage
increase
and
some,
i
think
six
months
advance
notice
of
job
abolitions
and
layoffs.
the
carriers,
bargaining
as
a
group,
proposed
wage
decreases
and
notice
of
abolitions
of
only
24
hours.
this
dispute
as
to
whether
wages
should
go
up
or
down
or
what
the
notice
should
be
for
employees,
it
was
a
dispute
subject
to
the
--
to
the
negotiation
and
mediation
procedures
which
i
described
before.
thus,
the
carrier
couldn't
implement
their
proposals
nor
could
the
union
strike
to
implement
its
proposals
until
the
whole
bargaining
procedure
was
completed.
over
the
course
of
the
next
nine
months,
all
the
acts
of
bargaining
procedures
were
entered
into.
negotiation
and
mediation
failed
with
regard
to
this
dispute,
but
then
the
presidential
board
was
appointed
and
the
presidential
board
recommended
a
solution
of
a
10
cent
an
hour
wage
increase
and
5
days
notice
of
job
abolitions.
in
june
1962
this
settlement
was
accepted
by
every
class
i
railroad
in
the
country
except
the
carrier
in
this
case.
florida
east
coast
railroad
was
the
only
railroad
of
its
class,
those
are
the
large
railroads,
not
to
accept
the
presidential
board's
recommended
solution.
after
they
did
that,
the
mediation
board
attempted
further
to
mediate
the
dispute
which
was
now
a
dispute
simply
between
the
fec
and
these
unions.
this
mediation
was
unsuccessful
and
the
board
was
unsuccessful
in
getting
the
parties
to
agree
to
the
arbitration.
at
the
beginning
of
both
parties
refused
the
arbitration.
later
on,
the
union
when
requested
again
by
i
think
the
secretary
of
the
labor
agreed
to
arbitration
and
as
it
now
stands,
the
union
will
agree
to
arbitrate
the
carriers
will
not.
thus,
you
have
an
impasse
reach
with
florida
east
coast
and
these
unions
about
this
wage
dispute.
then
the
dispute
reaches
the
point
where
a
strike
becomes
lawful
where
you
can
use
self-help
in
these
court's
work
the
union
can
go
out
on
strike
to
enforce
its
demands.
the
carrier
can
implement
its
demands
if
it
wants
because
they've
gone
through
all
the
statutory
negotiation
procedures.
in
january
1963,
such
a
strike
began.
now,
i
emphasize
again,
this
strike
was
entirely
lawful.
it
occurred
only
after
the
union
had
in
good
faith
attempted
to
bargain
with
the
employer
about
the
requests
it
made
and
about
the
proposals
that
the
carrier
made,
which
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
before
it
limited
to
this
wage
dispute
and
this
notice
of
dispute,
how
much
notice
you
need
for
job
abolition?
at
the
beginning
the
strike
was
apparently
effective.
the
other
employees
refused
to
cross
the
picket
line
and
the
railroad
shut
down
for
about
a
week.
the
strike
however
didn't
result
as
apparently
most
railroad
strikes
do
result
in
a
fairly
quick
settlement
of
the
dispute
and
the
railroad
decided
to
attempt
to
operate
despite
the
strike.
as
i
say
again,
it
had
a
perfect
right
to
attempt
to
do.
the
question
is
whether
in
attempting
to
do
it,
it
did
it
consistently
with
it's
obligations
on
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
no
question
that
they
may
hire
replacements.
no
question
--
mr.
paul
bender
no,
absolutely
not.
they
can
try
and
they
did
hire
replacements.
that's
what
they
immediately
attempted
to
do.
now,
in
hiring
replacements
which
it
started
to
do
i
think
about
a
week
after
the
strike
began,
it
wholly
ignored
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
which
existed
with
regard
to
the
crafts
in
which
these
replacements
were.
and
instead,
it
got
the
replacements
to
sign
individual
agreements
setting
their
wages,
rules
and
working
conditions
in
terms
as
the
district
court
found,
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
this,
substantially
different
from
the
term
set
out
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
then
a
bit
later,
in
september
of
1963,
after
they've
made
this
rash
of
individual
contracts,
they
decided
to
formalize
and
then
put
them
in
a
single
document
which
they
called
a
condition
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
mr.
paul
bender
they
were
free
to
hire
but
they
were
not
free
to
hire
except
that
the
wages
provided
in
their
collective
bargaining
agreements,
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
say
there
is
probably
an
elaborate
procedure
about
bulletining
the
jobs
advertising
and
taking
people
in
terms
of
whether
they
have
seniority
on
the
road
previously
on
--
mr.
paul
bender
there's
the
union
shop.
there's
the
union
shop,
yes.
now,
those
--
the
union
shop
agreement
was
ignored.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
oh
surely.
mr.
paul
bender
what
the
union
members
wanted
to,
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
then
they
can
hire
a
non-union
member
but
the
agreement
doesn't
provide
that
you
can
only
hire
union
members.
the
union
shop
provision
doesn't
mean
that
you
have
to
join
the
union
before
you
go
to
work.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
it's
the
union
shop
as
i
understand.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
know
but
certainly,
no.
mr.
paul
bender
certainly
this
--
none
of
these
agreements
contain
the
close
shop.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
they
had
to
attempt
to
join
the
union.
mr.
paul
bender
now,
then
it's
up
to
the
union
whether
or
not
to
accept
them
into
membership
or
not.
if
the
--
if
they
attempt
to
join
and
the
union
refuses
to
permit
them
to
which
it
might
very
well
do
with
strike
there.
mr.
paul
bender
then
their
obligation
is
relieved.
in
fact
i
think
that's
what
largely
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
this
is
one
of
the
provisions,
mr.
justice
stewart,
which
might
very
well,
under
a
fair
reading
of
the
agreement
you
might
decide
that
they
don't
have
to
abide
by
apprentice
ratios
during
a
situation
where
there
is
a
shortage
of
manpower.
that's
just
--
that
wouldn't
only
be
a
strike
exception.
it
might
occur
if
there
was
some
other
natural
disaster
which
prevented
them
from
getting
the
proper
ratios.
the
union
in
this
case
has
never
seek
--
the
carrier
in
this
case
has
never
suggested
that
this
--
that
this
is
what
they
want
to
do,
make
these
deviations
which
are
absolutely
necessary
because
it's
impossible
to
comply
with
the
other
terms.
they've
never
suggested
that
nor
they
suggested
that
such
deviations
would
be
possible
under
the
contrary.
we
know
mr.
justice
stewart
that
in
this
industry
it
is
common
place
to
bargain
about
what
you
do
during
emergencies
including
strikes.
they're
the
provisions
and
the
agreements
in
this
case
which
provided
during
a
strike
when
manpower
short
they
can
layoff
people
more
quickly,
they
can
--
than
they
can
do
it
otherwise.
our
position
is
that
one,
the
railroads
are
perfectly
free
to
bargain
about
changing
apprentice
ratios
when
there
are
manpower
shortages
and
if
they
want
to
do
it
they
should.
secondly,
even
if
they
haven't
bargained
about
it,
so
it's
not
explicit
in
the
act,
we
agree
that
it's
open
to
them
to
assert
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
agreement
would
permit
some
deviation
in
that
regard.
they
have
never
argued
that
in
this
case
and
the
case
simply
doesn't
come
to
this
court
in
that
posture
if
they
had
argued
it,
it
might
be
a
different
situation,
just
carrying
out
a
bit
further.
it
seems
to
us
that
if
they
had
made
such
an
argument
that
certain
changes
are
permissible
under
a
fair
reading
of
the
agreement
then
it
would
be
up
to
the
union
to
decide
whether
they
would
agree
or
not
that
the
agreement
permitted
that.
if
the
union
agreed
of
course
there
would
be
no
problem.
if
the
union
disagreed,
then
you'd
have
a
dispute
about
the
meaning
of
the
contract
and
that's
the
dispute
which
in
our
view
is
subject
to
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
railroad
adjustment
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
know
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
know.
i
think
in
the
past
it
may
have
been
that
unions
and
i
think
it's
not
at
all
fanciful
to
assume
that
they
would
in
the
future,
agree
to
some
things
like
that.
for
example,
to
the
use
of
supervisors
to
run
trains,
i'm
not
sure
at
all
that
unions
would
suggest
that
the
use
of
supervisors
to
engage
in
limited
operation
of
trains
when
ordinary
working
people
were
not
available
to
do
so
would
constitute
a
violation
of
the
agreements.
so
i'm
not
sure
that
they
could
so
suggest.
but
in
any
case,
it's
not
at
all
clear
to
me
that
the
unions
would
take
that
position.
in
any
case,
if
the
carrier
hasn't
urged
it
here,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
i
don't
think
that
question
arises.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
i
did.
mr.
paul
bender
oh,
i
--
excuse
me.
they
had
to
follow
the
contract
insofar
as
it
had
not
been
--
mr.
paul
bender
--
exhausted
or
excuse
me.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
but
it
does
--
it's
not
as
much
as
you
might
think
mr.
justice
white
because
--
mr.
paul
bender
right,
exactly.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
right
and
if
they
propose
a
25%
--
mr.
paul
bender
i'm
sorry.
i
stand
corrected.
they
didn't
have
to
pay
precisely
what
was
in
the
contract.
they
could
deviate
insofar
as
it
had
been
through
bargaining,
but
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
as
a
general
proposition,
when
you
hire
replacements
during
a
strike,
if
the
strike
hasn't
occurred
over
a
wage
dispute
then
you
do
have
to
pay
the
wage
rates
that
you
can
find
in
the
agreement.
mr.
paul
bender
you
mean
in
the
contract
negotiation?
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
they
suggest
a
decrease.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
think
it
decreases,
no.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
think
so,
no.
i
think
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
paul
bender
it's
hard
to
talk
about
in
those
terms
because
the
fundamental
thing
that
they
did
when
they
hired
replacement
was
to
totally
ignore
corrupt
lines.
they
disregarded
the
fact
that
one
man
is
a
machinist
and
another
man
is
something
else.
now,
the
collective
bargaining
wage
rates
as
i
understand
it,
framed
in
terms
of
craft
lines.
so
it's
very
hard
to
know
when
they
pay
people
under
their
system
which
ignores
the
craft
lines
whether
or
not
they
are
abiding
in
dollar
in
sense
terms
by
the
--
by
the
wage
rates
provided
in
the
agreement.
i
do
think
that
they
--
to
some
extent
at
least
abandoned
the
hourly
system
of
compensation
and
attempted
to
compensate
them
on
a
weekly
or
monthly
basis
which
is
contradictory
to
the
terms
provided
in
the
agreement,
but
the
fundamental
thing
they
did
in
hiring
replacements
which
affects
everything
else,
seniority,
wage
rates,
and
everything
else,
is
to
completely
wipe
out
the
craft
line.
i
think
the
first
provision
in
these
conditions
of
employment
is
employees
have
to
do
whatever
work
they're
qualified
to
do
and
whatever
work
they
carry
that
calls
upon.
and
then
that's
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
way
the
whole
industry
had
been
organizing
that
to
--
up
to
that
time.
well,
let's
just
finish
the
story.
after
they
had
--
after
they
had
done
this.
they
finally
propose
to
the
--
to
the
unions
some
months
later
that
these
unilateral
changes
they
had
made
be
made
permanent
unilateral
changes
by
filing
a
notice
under
the
act
to
negotiate
about
the
permanent
institution
of
these
changes
with
the
union.
this
was
after
they
had
implemented
them
already.
they
said
that
they
wanted
permanently
to
amend
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
to
do
this.
then
they
had
a
meeting
finally
with
the
union
about
this,
but
the
meeting
broke
up
because
the
carrier
insisted
on
having
a
court
reporter
at
present
to
take
that
on
a
negotiation
and
the
unions
refuse
to
bargain
under
those
circumstances.
the
union
then
took
the
next
statutory
step
and
invoked
the
services
of
the
mediation
board
about
this
dispute.
now,
this
is
a
different
dispute
from
the
wage
dispute.
this
is
the
dispute
about
whether
that
all
the
carrier's
sweeping
changes,
abolition
of
craft
lines
et
cetera
should
be
permanently
--
should
permanently
replace
the
existing
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
they
both
did.
they
ma
--
the
meeting
broke
up
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
you
have
to
serve
a
notice
on
the
other
side,
setting
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
paul
bender
the
carriers
serve
the
notice
because
it
proposes
a
change.
the
carrier
has
to,
under
the
act,
served
the
notice
because
it
proposes
the
change.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
in
--
mr.
paul
bender
the
carrier
--
is
the
one
who
proposes
the
change
that
has
to
and
in
this
case
it
was
the
carrier
that
was
proposing
a
change.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
the
mediation
board
docketed
this
dispute
for
mediation.
the
carriers
said
you
can't
do
that
because
the
unions
forfeited
its
right
to
mediate
or
to
engage
in
any
of
the
other
statutory
procedures
because
it
walk
out
on
that
meeting
because
of
the
court
reporter
and
the
mediation
board
said
“that
was
not
a
refusal
to
bargain
because
you
had
not
right
to
bargain
with
the
court
report.”
the
carrier
ignored
that
--
ignored
the
fact
that
the
mediation
board
has
docketed
the
dispute
and
went
right
ahead
and
permanently
instituted
these
changes
which
it
had
sought
to
bargain
about
and
which
the
mediation
board
still
wanted
it
to
bargain
about.
it
was
at
this
stage
that
the
united
states
initiated
the
present
litigation.
in
our
view
by
permanently
implementing
this
working
agreement
proposal,
despite
the
mediation
board's
decision
to
docket
the
dispute,
to
carrier
is
directly
violating
act
and
it's
completely
undercutting
the
board's
jurisdiction.
the
board
believes
and
we
thought
correctly
the
meaningful
mediation
that
carriers'
proposals
would
be
entirely
frustrated
by
the
carriers
having
already
implemented
those
proposals.
in
addition,
the
previous
action
of
the
carrier
and
just
acting
unilaterally
with
regard
to
its
employees
was
in
our
view
completely,
a
flagrant
violation
of
the
act.
to
our
knowledge,
no
carrier
previously
had
ever
contended
that
it
could
do
such
a
thing
and
we
thought
it
was
important
to
vindicate
the
act
in
the
face
of
these
action
as
means
of
maintaining
good
faith
bargaining
in
our
labor
industry
and
we
would
--
normally
we
are
mindful
in
doing
this
that
the
railroad
involves
survival
defense
installations
of
cape
of
kennedy
and
surrounding
areas
and
that
prolongation
or
intensification
of
this
dispute
might
very
well
have
consequences,
adverse
consequences
on
the
government's
programs
there.
plus
it's
also
a
standing
in
this
action
the
practical
standing
close
from
the
considerations
that
i've
just
said.
the
legal
basis
for
the
standing
i
think
that
flow
from
those
directly
with
--
it's
not
necessary
in
any
event
because
section
2
tenth
of
the
act,
it
seems
to
us
clearly,
gives
the
united
states
standing
to
initiate
an
action
such
as
this
and
that's
what
we've
got.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
agreed.
well,
the
district
court
as
i've
said
ultimately
after
the
court
of
appeals
rendered
this
decision
about
reasonably
necessary
changes
which
was
rendered
not
in
this
case
but
in
a
companion
case,
the
trainmen
case,
the
district
court
permitted
this
four
minor
such
changes
of
--
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
these
petitions
have
--
have
followed.
now,
let
me
talk
first
about
the
carriers'
argument
namely,
that
once
a
strike
has
occurred,
it
can
run
its
employee
relationships
entirely
as
it
wishes.
it
has
not
duty
to
bargain
with
anyone
about
employee
conditions
and
it
has
no
duty
to
abide
by
any
collective
agreements.
employees
hired
during
the
strike
are
treated
by
the
carrier
the
way
the
carrier
wants
to
treat
them
and
that
this
situation
continues
as
long
as
the
strike
continues.
now
this
argument
is
--
has
been
squarely
rejected
under
the
national
labors
relations
act.
fec
is
to
our
knowledge
that
first
carried
an
urgent
--
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
we
just
see
no
basis
for
it
under
the
railway
labor
act
especially
in
light
of
the
much
more
explicit
provisions
of
that
act
about
the
duty
to
bargain
and
about
the
fact
that
the
duty
to
bargain
clearly
includes
the
obligation
to
adhere
to
existing
collective
bargaining
agreements.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
they
do
it.
they
--
mr.
paul
bender
they
now
take
the
position
--
florida
east
coast
as
we
believe
the
only
first
carrier
who
had
taken
the
position.
they
took
it
in
this
case
and
the
amicus
brief
supports
(voice
overlap)
mr.
paul
bender
it
is
now
the
position
having
been
taken
by
florida
east
coast.
we
are
unaware
that
the
position
had
ever
been
taken
before.
it
annoys
it
--
a
matter
merely
of
the
language
of
the
act
which
i
emphasize
is
clearly
against
the
carriers'
position.
as
has
been
recognized
under
national
labors
relations
act
suspension
of
the
duty
to
bargain
during
a
strike
would
substantially
destroy
the
process
of
collective
bargaining
under
the
--
under
the
act.
it
doesn't
take
an
awful
lot
of
imagination
to
see
how
that
works.
for
example,
one
duty
which
clearly
continues
during
a
strike
is
the
duty
to
settle
the
dispute
which
led
to
the
strike,
that's
the
thing
the
act
once
settled,
that's
the
wage
and
notice
dispute
in
this
case.
you
can't
very
meaningfully
expect
the
union
and
the
carrier
to
settle
a
dispute
when
the
carrier
asserts
the
right
to
violate
all
its
agreements
with
the
union.
that
kind
of
violation
of
the
contract
where
the
party
was
doing
a
bargain,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
the
antithesis
of
meaningful
collective
bargaining.
also,
and
this
is
a
little
more
settled
but
i
don't
think
it's
difficult
to
see
how
it
occurs,
if
you
give
the
carrier
this
right
to
do
whatever
it
wants,
once
the
strike
occurs,
it
makes
the
pressure
of
the
strike
to
encourage
people
to
engage
in
the
collective
bargaining
really
[inaudible].
when
the
strike
occurs,
it's
a
--
it
may
well
be
a
good
thing
for
the
carrier
or
often
the
bad
thing
for
the
carrier.
they
do
whatever
they
want.
they
institute
the
most
sweeping
changes
and
they
say
to
the
union,
“you
strike
as
long
as
you
want.
as
long
as
you
strike,
we
will
run
a
totally
unrepresented
shop.
we
will
deal
with
our
employees
however
we
want”
and
they
can
go
further
as
the
carrier
went
in
this
case,
they
can
propose
once
they've
got
these
changes
instituted,
they
can
propose
to
keep
them
there
permanently
and
file
this
section
6
notices
to
permanently
change
throw
out
all
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
to
run
the
shop
on
their
own
terms
and
again,
they
sit
back.
they
don't
negotiate
meaningfully
over
that.
they
can
keep
their
proposals
in
effect
as
long
as
the
strike
continues
and
when
the
negotiations
finally
fail
on
their
long
range
proposals
they
can
amend
the
collective
bargaining
agreements.
now
you
just,
you
cannot
have
meaningful
collective
bargaining
in
these
circumstances
if
the
union
knows
that
as
soon
as
strikes
and
the
strike
is
the
only
way
that
the
union
has
of
trying
to
enforce
its
demands
after
negotiations
breaks
down,
you
cannot
have
meaningful
collective
bargaining
if
the
union
has
been
taking
the
choice
between
giving
up
the
shop,
giving
up
its
power
to
represent
the
employees
in
striking.
if
it
strikes
it
just
is
out
completely.
the
carrier
runs
the
shop
as
it
wishes
and
the
union
just
ultimately
capitulates.
excuse
me?
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
and
in
this
case
the
union
agreed
--
mr.
paul
bender
to
arbitrary
involvement.
at
three
different
occasions
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
that's
the
dispute
agreed
to
arbitrary
on
three
different
occasions.
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
on
april
3rd,
may
17th,
and
october
14th,
1963,
the
union
agreed.
it
initially
refused
to
arbitrate.
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
but
then
it
later
agreed
to
--
it
agreed
to
arbitration
and
certainly
either
side
may
agree
to
arbitration
mr.
justice
white
but
the
union
can
--
in
those
sense
compelled
arbitration.
if
it
agrees
and
the
carrier
disagrees
it
still
has
the
strike
and
that
its
only
--
its
only
remaining
possible
economic
lever
that
it
can
use
and
in
this
case
the
carrier
refused
to
arbitrate
and
i
think
--
mr.
paul
bender
you
mean
the
broad
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
know
there
were
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
don't
know
--
your
impressions
that
all
the
carriers
agreed
to
arbitrate
and
the
unions
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
know
about
that.
what
i
know
is
true
is
that
after
the
presidential
board
was
created
and
it
recommended
the
solution,
that
solution
was
adopted
by
all
the
unions
and
carriers
except
the
florida
east
coast.
now,
i
think
it's
been
the
union's
position,
or
at
least
it
was
the
unions'
position
at
that
time
that
they
were
willing
to
adopt
that
solution.
so
in
the
sense
they
were
willing
to
adopt
what
amounted
to
in
arbitration
(voice
overlap)
mr.
paul
bender
but
it's
an
impartial
recommendation.
mr.
paul
bender
yes
--
well,
now
let
me
turn
into
--
mr.
paul
bender
no
mr.
justice
fortas.
i'm
afraid
i
didn't
make
it
clear
what
i
meant
to
say.
it
seems
to
me
to
one
extent
i
agree
with
you.
whatever
the
union
is
willing
to
agree
–
mr.
paul
bender
but
i
don't
agree
--
i
don't
agree
that
they
have
the
right
to
violate
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
my
position
was
that
they
have
the
right
to
assert
certain
deviations
from
the
literal
language
of
the
agreement
is
not
a
violation
of
the
agreement.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
it's
very
important
--
mr.
paul
bender
no
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
paul
bender
i
didn't
--
i
suggest
that
they
might
be
able
to
make
deviations
but
not
in
violation
of
the
agreement.
my
only
suggestion
was
that
there
is
flexibility
in
these
agreements.
they
ought
to
be
read
realistically
in
light
of
situations
and
in
light
perhaps
of
unanticipated
situation
and
if
you
assume
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
agreement
might
permit
some
deviations
from
the
literal
term
that
we
concede
they
might
be
able
to
do,
that's
all.
mr.
paul
bender
did
you
say
to
hire
them
or
to
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
they
cannot
do
that.
mr.
paul
bender
because
it's
a
violation
of
the
existing
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
railway
labor
act
--
mr.
paul
bender
no,
i
didn't.
if
i
did,
i
didn't
mean
to.
what
i
meant
to
say
that
they
may
not
violate
the
agreement.
they
may
or
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice
fortas
maybe
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
it
does.
i
doubt
very
much
whether
it
does
that.
let
me
put
--
mr.
paul
bender
our
answer
to
that
is
that
they
may
not
recruit
in
violation
of
the
agreement.
what
i
did
try
to
say
was
that
they
may
urge
that
certain
recruiting
practices
not
explicitly
provided
in
the
agreement
are
not
a
violation
because
of
unusual
circumstances.
mr.
paul
bender
no.
our
position
is
that
if
they
make
such
a
contention
and
if
the
union
disagrees
with
the
construction
of
the
agreement
that
is
a
dispute
about
the
meaning
of
the
agreement
which
the
act
commits
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board,
not
to
the
district
court
and
that
the
dispute
should
primarily
be
taken
there.
now
that
doesn't
come
up
here
because
the
railroad
has
never
suggested
that
the
things
it
wants
to
do
are
permissible
under
a
fair
reading
of
the
agreement.
to
sum
up
the
position
that
i
have
mr.
justice
fortas
suppose
that
the
agreement
said
at
the
very
end
in
capital
letters
“and
these
provisions
shall
not
be
varied
in
the
slightest
because
of
the
existence
of
a
lawful
strike,”
there
is
no
question
in
our
mind
that
that
agreement
should
be
applied
as
written
and
it
was
not
very
unusual.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
exactly.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
and
that
they
can
bargain
for
that
in
advance
and
get
those
flexible
provisions
in
the
agreement
or
if
they
wish,
if
they
think
what
they've
bargained
for
prevents
them
totally
from
running
during
the
strike
and
that
that
is
an
impossible
situation,
they
can
agree
to
arbitrate
the
dispute
and
thereby
and
i
think
the
union
will
develop
this
argument.
avoid
these
constricting
procedures
of
the
railroad
labor
--
mr.
paul
bender
well
it's
--
it
is
because
we
do
take
that
by
position
and
one
other
reason
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
does
not
flow
from
the
agreement.
it
flows
from
the
right
to
operate
--
mr.
paul
bender
the
need
to
operate.
i
think
that
all
decisions
--
mr.
paul
bender
all
decisions
in
this
area
have
to
flow
from
the
agreements.
that's
what
the
railway
labor
act
requires.
i
will
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
argument
of
mr.
--
mr.
paul
bender
that's
a
question
which
has
never
been
presented
or
decided
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
bender
not
explicitly,
no.
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
that
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
think
that
if
the
railroad
suggested
that
that
did
not
violate
the
agreement
it
is
quite
a
likely
possibility
that
the
union
might
agree,
that
the
use
of
supervisory
personnel
when
they
didn't
replace
any
personnel
covered
by
the
agreement
would
not
amount
to
a
violation
of
the
agreement.
but
the
agreement
merely
says
--
mr.
paul
bender
they
don't
here,
but
if
they
did,
the
union
might
agree.
mr.
paul
bender
that
is
the
question
--
of
the
meaning
of
the
contract
which
so
far
as
i
know
mr.
chief
justice
is
never
going
to
be
authoritatively
decided
and
all
i'm
saying
is
that
i'd
like
to
know
the
answer.
mr.
paul
bender
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
i
meant
to
suggest
--
mr.
paul
bender
i
probably
misspoke
myself
and
i
apologize.
what
i
meant
to
suggest
was
that
they
might
be
able
to
urge
that
the
use
of
supervisors
would
not
violate
the
agreement
and
that
the
union
might
concede
or
that
the
railroad
adjustment
board
might
agree
with
them.
if
that
were
true
and
i
think
it's
quite
possible
that
it
is,
that
would
provide
a
certain
amount
of
flexibility.
the
history
supports
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
occasions
on
which
railroads
have
operated
during
strikes
have
been
mostly
with
supervisors.
and
i
don't
know,
i'm
not
aware
that
unions
have
strongly
suggested
in
those
cases
that
that
amounted
to
a
violation
of
the
agreement.
it's
quite
possible
that
the
general
positions
unions
would
take
is
that
that
does
not
amount
to
a
violation.
my
argument
is
that
that's
what
the
railroad
should
have
done
here.
they
should
have
urged
that
they
could
engage
in
operation
under
the
agreement
and
they
should
have
attempted
to
engage
in
operation
under
the
agreement
and
that
the
act
provides
all
panoply
of
procedures
for
deciding
any
questions
about
what
the
agreement
means
in
that
context,
but
the
carrier
did
wrong
here
was
to
ignore
the
agreement.
it
never
attempted
to
comply
with
it
and
their
position
in
this
court
is
just
that
and
boldly
that
because
they
don't
have
to
make
any
attempt
to
comply
with
their
agreements
during
a
strike.
that
is
what
we
say
is
wrong,
that
complete
negation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
paul
bender
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
i
have
about
nine
or
ten
minutes
left
and
i
understood
under
the
arrangement
that
we
had
that
the
rebuttal
would
be
15,
i
will
try
to
compress
it
within
the
time
left
so
i
will
move
fairly
fast.
i
think
that
at
this
time
of
the
oral
argument,
the
point
that
we
would
like
to
address
ourselves
to
right
at
the
initial
outset
is
where
what
has
been
conceded
by
both
sides
does
the
exception
to
the
railway
labor
act
spring
from.
where
did
the
court
of
appeals
find
the
basis
for
creating
the
doctrine
which
is
under
review
here,
the
so-called
doctrine
of
reasonably
necessary
exceptions
to
the
railway
labor
act?
i
think
everybody
concedes
the
fec,
the
association
of
american
railroads,
the
government
and
the
unions,
that
what
was
done
here
by
the
fec
could
not
have
been
done
but
for
strike
conditions.
and
the
plain
categorical
language
of
section
2
seventh
of
the
railway
labor
act
makes
this
clear.
and
i
would
like
to
refer
to
that,
it
hasn't
been
mentioned
in
so
many
words
and
it's
very
short
and
it's
very
clear.
and
it
says
“no
carrier,
its
officers
or
agents
shall
change
the
rates
of
pay,
rules
or
working
conditions
of
each
employees
as
a
class
as
embodied
in
agreement
except
in
the
manner
prescribed
in
such
agreements
or
in
section
156
namely
section
6
of
the
act.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
had
said
that
doesn't
apply
because
of
strike
conditions
because
it
bears
too
heavily,
too
hard
on
the
railroad
under
strike
conditions.
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
refer
to
any
language
in
the
act
to
support
this
exception.
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
refer
to
any
legislative
history
to
support
this
exception
and
we
submit
that
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
contended
that
it
bears
too
heavily
on
the
carrier
faced
with
the
strike
conditions
is
not
in
law
sufficient
to
create
the
exception
here
found
to
exist
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
there
are
three
basic
positions
in
this
case.
one
position
is
that
the
act
applies
under
strike
conditions
just
as
it
applies
when
there
are
no
strike
conditions.
that
is
the
government's
position,
that
is
our
position.
the
other
position
is
the
position
of
the
american
association
of
railroads
and
the
fec
that
under
strike
conditions
even
though
it
may
be
with
just
one
union
this
gives
the
railroad
the
legal
right
as
mr.
devaney
referred
to
it
to
totally
suspend
all
of
its
contracts
with
all
of
its
crafts,
in
this
case
there
are
21
different
crafts,
21
different
contracts.
that
is
the
counter
position.
in
between
the
court
of
appeals
who
said
“no,
you
cannot
totally
suspend
the
provisions
of
the
act,
but
we
will
permit
an
application,
the
railroad
to
come
in,
in
the
nature
of
equitable
relief
and
seek
certain
limited
exceptions
where
it
makes
a
showing
that
it
is
reasonably
necessary
for
the
railroad
to
do
so
in
order
to
operate
under
strike
conditions.
we
say
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
wrong
because
it
spins
out
of
the
whole
clock
an
exception
into
the
railway
labor
act
which
readjusts
the
economic
balance
struck
by
that
act
by
congress.
we
say
that
the
position
of
the
railroad
is
wrong
because
it
is
far
more
extreme
and
even
the
limited
exception
or
gloss
put
on
the
act
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
because
the
only
actions
of
the
railroad
in
this
case
shows
that
there
has
never
been
an
understanding
either
in
the
industry
or
by
this
particular
carrier
that
contracts
are
totally
suspended
under
strike
conditions.
three
concessions
have
been
made
by
counsel
for
the
railroad
in
this
case
which
are
totally
inconsistent
with
any
idea
of
contracts
or
the
act
being
suspended
during
a
strike.
one
is
that
the
strikers
earned
seniority.
how
can
they
earn
seniority
if
the
contracts
are
suspended?
one
is
the
grievances
maybe
processed
during
the
strike
as
they
are
being
done
on
the
property
today.
how
can
you
have
grievances
if
the
act
or
the
contracts
are
totally
suspended?
the
third
is,
if
the
union
is
the
representative
of
the
replacements
--
well,
how
can
that
be
if
the
act
or
the
contracts
are
suspended?
and
we
would
like
to
point
to
something
which
we
think
is
even
more
clearly
about
what
the
understanding
of
this
particular
carrier
and
the
railroad
industry
is
generally
and
that
is
the
section
6
proposals
involved
in
this
very
case.
the
proposals
made
by
the
carrier
in
september
of
1963,
eight
or
nine
months
after
this
strike
began
and
i
would
like
to
refer
to
page
44
of
the
exhibit
record
where
one
of
those
section
6
notices
is
set
forth,
and
page
254
--
excuse
me,
page
416
of
the
exhibit
record
where
another
of
those
section
6
proposals
is
set
forth
and
this
is
what
they
say.
they
say
“article
3,
“we
propose
a
bargain
with
you
about
putting
in
to
our
collective
bargaining
contract
article
3
entitled
work
stoppages.”
and
then
it
goes
on
and
there's
a
full
paragraph
here
in
which
it
sets
out
contract
provisions
that
would
govern
during
work
stoppages.
now,
how
is
this
consistent
with
any
idea
that
the
contracts
or
the
act
are
totally
suspended
under
the
act?
we
submit
your
honor
that
the
whole
process
of
the
railway
labor
act,
the
whole
scheme
of
it
is
to
take
disputes
and
narrowly
confine
and
refine
and
define
them
to
the
point
where
they
become
confined
rather
than
expanded.
this
dispute
started
out
as
a
very
simple
wage
dispute.
it
got
down
to
the
point
where
the
difference
between
the
parties
was
only
10
cents
an
hour.
it
now
involves
literally
every
single
rule,
rate
of
pay,
and
working
condition
in
21
different
contracts
on
the
entire
property.
that's
how
the
--
mr.
paul
bender
that's
correct
your
honor,
but
what
they
did
here
and
what
the
record
shows
they
did,
they
put
in
these
conditions
of
employment
the
so-called
strike
imposed
conditions
of
employment,
they
said
they
were
only
to
be
temporary
but
actually
what
they
did,
they
put
those
in,
they
codified
them
and
written
for
them
on
september
1,
three
weeks
later,
september
24
--
september
25,
they
issued
section
6
notices
which
are
substantially
the
same
saying
“we
want
this
as
the
permanent
change.”
in
other
words,
what
has
happened
here
is
that
the
whole
issue
has
expanded
to
the
point
where
the
mediators
involved,
labor
department
throw
up
their
hands.
i
think
that's
the
reason
the
government
is
in
this
suit
is
because
the
whole
process
of
mediation
of
existing
disputes
once
a
strike
exists
is
completely
frustrated
both
by
the
doctrine
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
doctrine
asserted
by
the
carriers
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
bender
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
bender
that's
correct
your
honor.
now
that's
the
difference.
that's
the
--
these
airline
cases,
these
eastern
airline
case
for
example
as
the
first
of
them
shows
by
judge
feinberg,
the
changes
made
by
eastern
airlines
were
within
the
scope
of
its
section
6
notice,
so
there
had
been
bargaining
on
that
--
on
that
issue
and
the
procedures
of
the
act
had
been
exhausted.
eastern
airlines
never
attempted
to
operate
contrary
to
an
existing
contract.
the
question
in
that
case
was
which
contract
governed?
it
was
a
jurisdictional
dispute
but
it
--
eastern
the
carrier
there
always
operated
in
conformity
with
an
existing
contract.
thank
you
your
honors.
