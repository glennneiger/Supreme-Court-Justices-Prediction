justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bender,
you
really
didn't
mean
to
say
that
you
--
that
in
making
--
in
paying
replacements
you
have
to
follow
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
that
exhausted
the
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
find
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
quite
a
little
--
little
acceptance.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
they
can
do
anything
with
what
they
had
hoped?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
that
they
proposed
wages
to
go
down,
they
couldn't
increase
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
assume
it's
true
to
say,
they
had
to
pay
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
always
arbitration.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
and
when?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
original
dispute?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
what
stand?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
before
the
strike.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you've
ignored
the
--
you've
ignored
the
fact
lines
in
the
replacements
as
i
understand
it.
so
you've
hired
people
to
do
jobs
that
never
existed
before
in
just
that
form.
now,
what
if
you
hired
somebody
to
do
a
job
that
included
work
that's
--
no
one
else
have
ever
done
before
in
that
particular
combination,
and
then
the
strike
is
settled.
and
then
you
say
the
agreement
was
back
to
its
original
form
with
the
same
job
descriptions
and
classifications.
then
what
happens
to
that
replacement
who
doesn't
fit
in
any
of
those
classifications?
does
he
stay
on
the
job?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
you
haven't
done
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
all
of
your
people
--
all
of
your
replacements
whatever
work
they
do
nevertheless
they're
called
or
they
fit
within
the
existing
classification.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
--
are
you
really
suggesting
that
--
that
all
of
these
things
you
want
to
be
free
to
do
are
minor
disputes
merely
--
merely
grievance
type
things
under
the
contract.
i
would
think
that
the
--
what
you
say
that
some
of
them
wouldn't
be
subject
to
the
whole
this
kind
of
an
adjustment.
this
is
really
a
major
change
in
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
matter
what
kind
of
a
change
is
instituted,
whether
it's
minor,
major,
or
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
is
the
adjustment
board
got
to
do
with
it
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
to
say
you
aren't
bound
by
the
agreement
then
--
that
if
the
adjustment
board
found
you
had
violated
it,
they
have
to
remedy
it?
that's
the
--
the
degrees
of
waiting
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
able
to
be
free
to
violate
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
we'll
you
have
to
stipulate
--
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
could
do
some
systems
of
[inaudible]
not
to
hire
them
maybe
not
to
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
not
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
not
run
through
this
--
the
board
[inaudible]
as
a
matter
of
interpretation
speaking
of
interpretation
that
would
take
it
to
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
having
this
--
under
the
one
roof
or
the
other?
in
the
[inaudible]
that
had
mentioned
the
board
must
say
this
expedience
does
not
violate
the
[inaudible]
an
emergency
[inaudible]
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
--
during
a
strike
like
this
who
is
the
representative
of
your
employees
or
do
you
recognize
if
there
is
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
employee,
the
ones
on
the
strike
or
the
ones
who
are
working
for
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
--
but
you
don't
think
there's
a
duty
to
bargain
about
--
that
you
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
the
representative
but
during
the
strike
not
to
bargain
with
your
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
--
--carrier
to
put
them
into
effect.
and
it
does
not
require
a
bargain.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
about
the
--
how
about
grievances?
those
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
that
the
contract
continues
for
purposes
of
contacting
grievances?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
that
involves
kind
of
a
settlement
on
the
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
who
would
you
talk
to
about
the
agreements,
the
union
or
do
you
talk
to
somebody
among
your
replacements?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
has
been
that
[inaudible]
if
you're
having
grievances
[inaudible]
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
refusing
to
do
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
all
of
your
--
i
take
it
to
--
you
also
want
to
be
able
to
--
you
want
to
be
able
to
say
that
the
union
shop
provision
is
suspended
during
the
strike.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
i
read
your
brief
i
take
it
that
you
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the

i
thought
the
railroad
said
that
once
the

the
wage
matter
was
settled
at
the
time
that
--
the

come
back
into
