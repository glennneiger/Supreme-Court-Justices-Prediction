mr.
richard
f.
watt
mr.
justice
black,
if
the
court
please.
this
matter
is
before
the
court
in
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
which
in
march
of
1965
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
a
stockholder's
derivative
suit
which
had
been
filed
in
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
very
briefly
stated,
and
i
will
come
back
in
a
moment
to
give
more
detail.
the
ground
for
dismissal
was
that
the
plaintiff
shareholder
had
filed
a
false
verification
required
by
rule
23
(b)
of
the
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure.
federal
rule
23
(b)
specifies
that
in
derivative
suits,
the
complaint
shall
be
verified
and
it
also
specifies
certain
matters
which
shall
be
set
out
in
the
complaint.
the
petitioner's
view
that
this
raises
an
important
issue
under
the
federal
rules
and
one
that
goes
far
beyond
the
outcome
of
this
particular
case
because
it
poses
directly
the
question
as
to
whether
a
procedural
rule
can
be
used
to
impose
upon
admittedly
a
poorly
educated
and
ignorant
stockholder,
a
very
substantial
obstacles
to
her
bringing
a
derivative
suit
where
alleging
misconduct
on
the
part
of
officers
and
directors
of
the
corporation
in
which
she
own
stock.
the
record
is
clear
that
the
petitioner
here
is
a
foreign-born,
ill-educated
seamstress
in
her
mid
60s.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
on
the
deposition
below
indicate
that
she
had
difficulty
in
spelling
her
son-in-law's
name,
his
name
is
irving
brilliant.
the
complaint
here
was
filed
in
december
of
1963.
it
consists
of
11
counts,
eight
of
which
alleged
violations
under
the
securities
act
of
1933
and
the
securities
of
exchange
act
of
1934.
very
briefly,
it
charges
that
the
officers
and
directors
who
are
named
as
defendants,
wrongfully
and
in
violation
of
the
securities
act
made
used
of
the
corporation
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
shares
of
stock
of
the
corporation
and
also,
hilton
credit
corporation
and
that
included
in
the
shares
of
stock
which
were
purchased
were
very
large
amounts
of
shares
from
the
officers
and
directors
themselves
with
the
result
that
approximately
$12
million
of
hilton
hotels
corporation
funds
that
were
used
for
this
purchases.
approximately
$4,800,000,
were
used
to
purchase
the
shares
of
the
officers
and
directors,
and
those
funds
were
paid
to
those
officers
and
directors
for
the
purchase
of
their
stock.
the
complaint
is
filed,
was
signed
by
three
attorneys
and
it
was
verified
by
mrs.
surowitz
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
rule
23
(b).
she
verified
as
true
and
correct,
certain
facts,
very
largely
the
facts
of
her
stock
ownership
and
the
other
facts
which
would
indicate
that
she
has
standing
or
status
to
sue
as
a
stockholder.
the
balance
that
is
the
charges
of
wrongdoings
were
verified
by
her
on
information
and
belief.
before
answer
was
filed,
the
defendant
moved
to
take
mrs.
surowitz's
deposition.
upon
receipt
of
that
notice,
we
appeared
in
court
and
asked
the
district
court
to
postpone
the
taking
of
the
deposition
until
the
defendants
had
filed
some
pleadings
or
answers
so
that
we
would
have
a
better
idea
as
to
what
issues
might
be
raised.
the
district
court
declined
to
postpone
the
deposition,
and
therefore,
the
deposition
was
taken
in
february
of
1964
prior
to
any
pleading
having
been
filed
by
the
defendants.
the
deposition
was
concluded
and
on
the
same
afternoon,
at
approximately
3:30,
as
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
we
were
served
with
notice
that
on
the
next
morning,
the
defendants
would
appear
before
the
district
judge
and
present
a
written
motion.
now,
the
motion
appears
in
the
transcript
of
record
at
page
117.
in
that
motion,
two
grounds
were
asserted
for
dismissal.
one,
that
the
pleading
was
a
sham
pleading;
and
secondly,
that
mrs.
surowitz
was
not
a
proper
party
plaintiff.
the
following
morning,
when
we
appeared
in
court,
the
defendants
filed
an
affidavit
which
indicated
that
the
records
of
the
corporation
showed
that
she
had
not
become
a
stockholder
of
record
until
october
of
1963
and
this
was
presumably
the
basis
for
asserting
that
she
was
not
a
proper
party
plaintiff
because
she
did
not
have
the
contemporaneous
stock
ownership
required
by
rule
23
(b).
the
district
judge
at
that
time
initially
was
inclined
to
have
the
matter
argued
immediately
but
at
our
request,
he
gave
us
15
days
in
which
to
file
affidavits.
in
response
to
the
motion
therefore,
we
filed
two
affidavits,
the
affidavit
of
irving
brilliant,
mrs.
surowitz's
son-in-law,
and
the
affidavit
of
walter
rockler,
one
of
the
attorneys.
the
matter
was
argued
later
on
march
and
the
court
at
the
end
argument
announced
the
order
would
be
one
of
dismissal.
thereafter,
at
the
court's
request,
counsel
for
the
defendants'
prepared
detailed
and
lengthy
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
which
were
discussed
in
court
on
march
the
27th
and
the
order
of
dismissal
was
actually
entered
on
march
30,
1964.
in
mrs.
surowitz's
deposition,
she
was
able
to
testify
that
her
son-in-law
had
purchased
stock
for
her
with
her
money
and
at
one
point,
she
indicated
the
stock
was
purchased
in
1957.
that
in
late
1962
or
early
1963,
she
received
certain
communications
from
hilton
hotels
corporation
turned
them
over
to
her
son-in-law
and
in
effect
asked
him
what
they
were
all
about.
now,
later
in
march
after
a
further
discussion
between
mrs.
surowitz
and
her
son-in-law,
he
brought
to
her
a
letter
of
protest
which
is
a
document
attached
to
the
deposition.
and
in
that
letter
of
protest
which
she
signed,
stated
that
she
opposed
as
improper
the
two
stock
purchase
transactions
which
i
have
mentioned.
in
the
summer
of
1963,
the
dividend
on
hilton
hotels
corporation
was
passed.
she
again
spoke
to
her
son-in-law.
he
advised
her
that
he
was
looking
into
the
matter
and
it
was
of
the
opinion
that
certain
officers
and
directors
had
acted
improperly.
subsequently,
in
december,
the
son-in-law
brought
the
complaint
to
her
which
had
been
prepared
by
counsel
in
chicago.
he
read
and
explained
it
to
her,
and
following
that,
she
signed
the
verification.
the
deposition
also
indicates
and
we
do
not
dispute
this
at
all
that
so
far
as
her
ability
to
explain
or
answer
the
basis
for
the
complaint
in
the
sense
of
articulating
the
facts
or
the
basis
for
certain
allegations,
she
was
unable
to
do
that.
she
answered
repeatedly
that
she
did
not
know.
she
could
not
say
it
on
her
own
words.
she
did
not
understand.
she
didn't
know.
she
left
it
to
her
son-in-law.
she
also
stated,
however,
that
she
knew
that
her
stock
was
not
right
and
that
she
indicated
that
when
the
complaint
was
brought
to
her
after
these
previous
discussions
that
i've
indicated
following
her
son-in-law's
explanation,
she
signed
it.
the
affidavits
of
mr.
brilliant
and
mr.
rockler
indicate,
it
seem
to
me
beyond
question
that
before
this
complaint
was
prepared
and
filed,
a
very
substantial
amount
of
investigatory
in
research
work
had
been
done
both
by
mr.
brilliant
and
by
mr.
rockler
and
his
associates
in
chicago.
a
great
deal
of
effort
was
made
to
go
to
records,
to
track
down
transactions,
to
look
at
financial
statements
and
so
on,
and
those
are
set
out
in
some
detail.
mr.
brilliant
also
states
in
his
affidavit
that
when
he
presented
the
complaint
to
his
mother-in-law,
mrs.
surowitz,
he
told
her
that
it
represented
the
result
of
work
that
he
had
done
and
that
the
attorney
in
chicago
had
done,
and
that
it
was
his
opinion
that
it
was
soundly
based.
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
in
this
connection
that
mr.
brilliant
himself
has
legal
training.
he
has
acted
as
an
investment
counselor
for
a
number
of
years
and
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
record,
that
since
1957
in
connection
with
the
small
investment
she
has
made,
mrs.
surowitz
has
relied
upon
her
son-in-law
for
his
recommendations
and
for
his
judgment.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
affirming,
held
at
the
verification
was
false
and
it
held
that
it
was
false
because
in
her
deposition,
mrs.
surowitz
indicated
that
she
lacked
requisite
knowledge
and
understanding
to
know
what
she
was
verified.
the
actual
words
of
the
court
which
i
think
are
significant
for
purposes
of
the
issue
now
here
at
the
--
at
record
237,
the
court
said,
she
lacked
completely
--
she
completely
lacked
any
knowledge
of
the
basis
of
the
complaint
at
the
time
when
she
signed
the
same
and
swore
to
the
verity
thereof.
at
the
bottom
of
235
and
36,
the
court
said
that
the
verification
requirement,
that
is
rule
23
(b),
is
designed
to
compel
a
plaintiff
to
begin
such
suit
with
sufficient
knowledge
of
facts
and
information
to
show
by
his
verification
that
there
is
a
substantial
basis
to
support
the
complaint
which
she
made.
it
is
our
view
that
this
is
not
a
proper
interpretation
of
rule
23
(b)
and
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed,
primarily
for
two
reasons.
rule
23
(b)
is
a
procedural
rule.
we
believe
that
should
be
liberally
construed
particularly
in
light
of
the
important
public
policy
considerations
where
it's
in
--
where
--
which
is
in
--
which
are
involved
in
causes
of
action
arising
under
the
securities
act
and
the
intent
of
congress
that
stockholders
would
act
in
effect
as
ancillary
enforcers
of
those
acts.
secondly,
we
believe
that
if
one
studies
the
history
of
rule
23
(b).
it
is
quite
clear
that
its
principle
purpose
was
to
prevent
collusive
resort
to
the
federal
courts
and
that
it
was
not
intended
and
no
court
has
held
that
it
was
intended
to
impose
a
kind
of
comprehension
test
upon
a
plaintiff
stockholder
before
that
stockholder
would
have
a
right
as
the
instigator
to
bring
a
corporate
cause
of
action
to
court.
very
briefly,
let
me
indicate
why
in
the
context
of
the
facts
here,
we
believe
the
public
policy
considerations
are
significant.
it
is
no
longer
the
case
in
this
country
that
stocks
are
held
only
by
a
relatively
limited
class
of
persons.
all
the
statistics
indicate
that
stock
ownership
is
becoming
much
more
widespread.
significantly
enough,
the
largest
single
group
of
stockowners
in
the
united
states
today
are
housewives
and
unemployed
women.
elderly
women,
in
particular,
hold
substantial
bodies
and
quantities
of
stock.
the
securities
act,
if
one
looks
to
the
legislative
history,
were
particularly
designed
to
protect
unknowledgeable,
and
gullible,
and
uninformed,
and
uneducated
individuals
who
might
invest
in
the
stock
market.
consequently
to
rule
--
to
construe
rule
23
(b),
as
a
qualification
upon
the
comprehension
of
a
stockholder
before
that
stockholder
can
bring
a
derivative
suit
is
very
likely
to
bar
the
very
individual
sought
to
be
protected
by
the
securities
act.
now,
from
coming
to
the
courts
at
all
with
complaints
based
upon
alleged
wrongdoing
by
corporate
officers
and
directors.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
it
does
not
in
so
many
words,
your
honor.
there
is
no
definitive
holding
on
that
point
by
this
court
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
which
we
did
not
cite
in
our
brief
which
cast
serious
doubt
upon
the
right
of
anyone
other
than
the
plaintiff
himself
could
verify.
that
is
consumers
gas
trust
company
versus
quimby,
it's
found
at
137
federal
882.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
we
did
not
sir.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
882,
137
federal
882
but
we
would
say
to
do
that
question
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
federal.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
no,
sir.
this
is
a
1905
case.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
there
has
been
some
district
court
cases
which
have
held
that
in
attorney
may
verify.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
it
was
construing
the
old
equity
rule
94
which
was
the
predecessor
of
rule
23
(b).
94
became
equity
rule
27
and
rule
23
(b)
is
modeled
very
closely
after
that.
we
would
say
in
response
to
that
that
since
the
principle
purpose
of
rule
23
(b)
and
old
equity
rule
94
was
to
guarantee
to
the
federal
courts
that
their
jurisdiction
was
not
being
invoked
collusively
by
an
arrangement
between
the
corporation
and
the
stockholder
in
order
to
obtain
the
requisite
diversity
of
citizenship
that
the
plaintiff
himself,
the
stockholder,
is
the
individual
most
likely
to
have
knowledge
of
specific
facts
which
would
demonstrate
the
facts
non-collusive
character
at
present.
he
would
know
best
when
he
acquired
the
stock.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
yes,
it
might,
your
honor,
but
under
those
circumstances,
that
if
in
any
case
counsel
might
verify
then
rule
23
(b)
and
the
derivative
case
would
add
absolutely
nothing
to
rule
11.
because
under
rule
11,
counsel
is
required
to
certify
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
information
and
belief,
the
case
is
soundly
grounded.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
only
in
one
respect
and
that
is
when
she
was
asked
whether
what
fact
she
had
supporting
the
allegation
that
this
was
not
a
collusive
suit.
she
indicated
that
she
did
not
understand
the
question.
however,
she
did
testify
that
she
did
not
know
any
of
the
defendants,
had
not
had
any
conversations
with
any
of
the
defendants,
and
no
conversations
with
any
of
the
defendants
had
been
reported
to
her
which
would
the
facts
justifying
the
collusion
--
a
conclusion
of
lack
of
collusion
but
she
stated
she
did
not
understand
the
question.
that
is
not
so
novel,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
because
there's
one
of
the
early
rule
94
cases
in
which
the
largest
single
stockholder,
the
people's
gas
light
and
coke
company
in
chicago,
when
asked
on
deposition
whether
the
suit
was
collusive,
initially,
said
that
he
understood
but
it
was
not
and
then
stated
that
he
did
not
understand
the
question.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
think
it
is
rather
difficult
concept
to
understand
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
shall,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
it
would
be
our
position
that
the
problem,
a
plaintiff
stockholder
and
particularly
a
small
plaintiff
stockholder
faces
in
bringing
a
derivative
suit
are
sufficiently
difficult
without
imposing
in
a
further
test
which
we
do
not
believe
is
required
by
the
history
and
purpose
of
rule
23
(b).
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
think
the
case
is
hold,
in
effect,
mr.
justice
black,
that
a
derivative
suit
by
a
stockholder
is
by
that
circumstance
on
behalf
of
all
similarly
situated
stockholders
who
might
have
a
right
to
assert
that
the
corporation
should
have
sued
against
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
officers
and
directors.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
can't
specifically
point
any
at
the
moment
but
i
know
that
there
are
indications
that
where
at
one
stockholder
brings
a
derivative
suit,
it
has
a
class
suit
aspect
to
it.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
that's
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
don't
believe
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
it
is
for
the
corporation
and
the
cases
hold
that
the
corporation
is
an
indispensable
party
because
any
recovery
will
accrue
to
the
corporation.
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
rule
23
(b)
is
a
derivative
or
secondary
cause
of
action
by
a
stockholder
where
the
corporation
itself
has
not
asserted
the
cause
of
action.
and
that
must
be
verified
according
to
rule
23
(b)
and
that
prove
back
to
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
we
held
our
rule
23
(b)
your
honor
set
out
at
the
end
of
our
brief
at
page
58
and
it
is
described
as
an
action
brought
to
enforce
a
secondary
right
on
the
part
of
one
or
more
shareholders
in
an
association
and
so
on
because
the
association
refuses
to
enforce
the
rights
which
may
properly
be
asserted
by
it.
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
the
principal
purpose
of
rule
23
(b)
was
to
prevent
collusive
resort
to
the
federal
court.
and
if
one
reads
hawes
versus
oakland
which
was
decided
in
1882,
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
court
felt
that
many
corporations
not
desiring
for
one
reason
or
another
to
go
into
the
state
courts
and
not
wishing
to
have
their
causes
of
action
tried
as
ordinary
actions
at
law
would
seek
out
a
friendly
stockholder,
have
that
stockholder
who
have
the
requisite
diversity
of
citizenship,
initiate
a
proceeding
in
the
federal
court
which
by
that
circumstance
would
be
a
suit
in
equity.
the
doctrine
goes
back
to
an
1856
decision
of
this
court,
dodge
versus
woolsey
and
in
dodge
versus
woolsey,
the
concept
of
the
derivative
suit
by
a
stockholder
asserting
a
cause
of
action
which
the
corporation
would
not
assert
was
established.
but
when
one
reads
dodge
versus
woolsey,
it
is
clear
that
the
argument
was
made
there
that
collusion
existed
and
the
court
decided
that
there
was
not
evidence
of
collusion.
but
the
dissenting
justices
stated
quite
clearly
in
dodge
versus
woolsey
that
this
practice
would
open
up
the
federal
courts
two
collusively
sought
jurisdiction.
and
that
apparently
is
what
happened
because
when
the
court
reviewed
the
matter
in
hawes
versus
oakland,
it
said
that
the
dodge
versus
woolsey
doctrine
had
been
abused
in
this
fashion
and
it
therefore
sought
to
close
the
door.
the
corporations
are
ranging
through
friendly
stockholders
to
obtain
federal
jurisdiction
in
this
fashion.
we
say
that
it
is
--
that
is
its
principal
purpose.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
there
were
--
mr.
richard
f.
watt
the
language
goes
beyond
that
mr.
justice
harlan
in
the
sense
that
i
think
there
are
certain
basic
elements
of
equity
which
are
also
in
the
rule.
the
concept
that
someone
should
not
bring
a
suit
of
this
kind
if
he
did
not
have
stock
at
the
time
of
the
transactions
complained
of,
that
has
a
thrust
against
the
collusive
suit
problem
but
it
probably
goes
beyond
that.
we
would
conceive
that
certainly.
there
are
decisions
since
then
in
which
it
is
asserted
that
one
of
the
purpose
of
the
rule
was
to
bar
strike
suits,
to
bar
speculation
and
litigation,
to
bar
purchase
claimants
from
being
brought
into
the
courts.
but
even
if
one
assumes
that
there
are
these
additional
reasons
beyond
the
principle
one
which
i
have
asserted,
i
cannot
see
how
those
reasons
justify
the
interpretation
of
rule
23
(b)
as
it
is
been
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
below.
it's
obvious
that
if
someone
is
a
professional
strike
suiter
or
if
an
attorney
is
a
specialist
in
what
might
be
described
the
bringing
of
strike
suit.
all
he
needs
to
do
is
to
find
the
stockholder
who
can
recite
well
what
the
stockholder
is
told.
now,
the
fact
that
a
stockholder
can
be
posed
well
and
articulate
what
the
attorney
has
told
him
is
certainly
no
guarantee
that
that
individual
is
not
a
strike
suiter.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
the
fact
that
a
person
is
unable
to
articulate
certain
things
does
not
remember
what
was
told
to
him
or
her
is
no
sign
that
that
individual
is
a
strike
suiter.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
no.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
i
think
the
clearest
example
of
the
kind
of
situation
that
you
have
reference
to
mr.
justice
fortas
is
in
freeman
versus
kirby
which
is
one
of
the
cases
that
we
cited
on
our
brief.
and
there
were
two
cases
that
arose
out
of
the
same
general
alleghany
corporation
litigation
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
murchison
versus
kirby
which
we
believe
sustains
the
position
that
we
assert
here,
and
it's
the
other
case
freeman
versus
kirby
in
which
it
was
clear
that
the
stockholder
had
no
contact
whatsoever
with
the
lawyer
at
all.
all
that
the
lawyer
had
sought
out
a
stockholder
and
in
which
the
lawyer
himself
had
virtually
no
information
except
a
memorandum
on
which
to
base
the
facts
which
he
set
forth
in
the
pleading
and
under
those
circumstances,
it
would
held
that
the
attorney
had
violated
the
rule
11.
now,
the
murchison
case
which
we
contend
is
extremely
close
to
the
situation
here.mr.
murchison,
the
plaintiff
on
deposition
was
asked
questions
endeavoring
to
ascertain
what
facts
he
had
supporting
certain
allegation,
questions
which
from
the
decision
appeared
within
quite
similar
to
questions
posed
to
mrs.
surowitz
here.
obviously,
a
man
with
many
investment
experiences
so
he
was
able
to
answer
it
but
what
is
significant
is
that
he
stated
that
this
information
was
general
that
he
relied
upon
his
attorneys
that
he
asked
his
attorneys
whether
they
thought
they
could
make
a
case
out
of
this
and
they
assured
him
that
they
could.
it
was
asserted
there
that
the
violation
of
rule
11
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
attorneys
had
knowingly
procured
a
false
verification
by
their
client,
mr.
murchison.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
this
motion
was
first
presented
in
the
district
court
when
it
was
asserted
that
this
was
a
sham
pleading
that
mrs.
surowitz's
was
pleading
with
the
sham
pleading,
it
certainly
appeared
to
us
now
that
this
was
a
rule
11
charge
because
there
is
no
other
place
than
the
federal
rules
where
the
term
sham
pleading
appears
except
in
rule
11.
it
is
now
been
turned
about
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
always
though
the
thrust
of
the
motion
was
it
--
it
was
the
motion
to
dismiss
for
a
false
verification.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
if
a
party
in
litigation
has
in
that
fashion
abused
the
processes
of
the
court,
that
party
should
be
punished
but
i
do
not
think
that
here,
the
remedy
is
dismissal
of
the
case
where
it
is
used
for
purposes
of
punishment
and
we
would
go
back
to
the
line
of
cases
that
beginning
with
hobby
versus
elliot
and
down
to
the
more
recent
cases
in
this
court
which
indicate
that
there
is
a
real
due
process
problem.
if
dismissal
under
rule
41
(b)
is
used
as
it
needs
in
punishing
a
litigant.
there
must
be
a
basis
for
assuming
that
the
misconduct
by
the
litigant
justifies
the
presumption
that
the
merits
are
against
the
litigant
and
that
instance
accordingly
dismissed
under
rule
41
(b).
but
if
it
is
a
means
of
punishment
for
wrongdoing,
then
it
is
depriving
the
litigant
of
substantive
rights
and
this
court
has
indicated
that
the
--
that
ordinarily,
that
will
not
be
permitted.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
no,
there
was
not,
your
honor.
now
the
problem
quite
succinctly
was
this.
we
obviously
could
not
seek
out
another
plaintiff.
mr.
brilliant
owned
shares
only
in
a
fiduciary
capacity.
his
wife
who
own
shares
was
a
chronically
ill
woman.
it
was
our
position
that
an
important
issue
was
raised.
we
were
not
completely
certain
that
any
difect
--
defect
might
be
cured
by
somebody
else's
verifying
to
the
reason
that
i
have
stated.
and
furthermore,
the
district
court
was
inclined
to
dismiss
by
charging
the
counsel
had
violated
the
rule
--
a
local
rule,
rule
39.
but
we
were
therefore
in
a
position
in
which
an
appeal
from
our
standpoint
was
essential.
we
felt
that
this
issue
mainly
the
use
of
rule
23
(b)
in
the
fashion
that
was
used
here
was
one
that
should
be
brought
up
and
determined.
and
that
was
the
reason
that
we
acted
as
we
get
through.
now,
finally
if
i
might
very
briefly
call
the
court's
attention
to
one
argument
made
which
i
would
like
to
comment
on.
namely,
that
mr.
rockler's
affidavit
cannot
be
possibly
suffice
us
a
verification,
because
of
the
reservation
at
the
end
of
it
which
appears
at
the
record
143.
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
that
reservation
is
an
order
to
safeguard
the
attorney
client
privilege
and
the
work
product
of
the
attorney
but
mr.
rockler
clearly
states,
under
oath,
in
that
affidavit
that
in
his
view
the
case
is
soundly
grounded
and
that
the
proof
will
establish
the
essential
veracity
of
the
facts
alleged.
if
there
is
a
defect
in
the
verification,
it
would
be
our
position
that
the
court
is
entitled
to
search
the
record
to
see
if
the
defect
is
made
up
anywhere
in
the
same
as
the
court
may
search
the
record
to
see
at
a
possible
defect
and
allegation
of
citizenship
is
made
elsewhere
--
made
up
elsewhere
in
the
record.
so
that
whether
mr.
rockler's
ver
--
affidavit
was
labeled
a
verification
or
not,
it
serves
the
essential
purpose
of
assuring
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
basis
for
the
allegation.
mr.
richard
f.
watt
we
are
in
dilemma.
if
it
cannot
be
satisfied
by
the
verification
of
counsel,
obviously,
then
the
suggestions
that
have
been
made
elsewhere
during
the
course
of
this
case
would
not
have
enabled
us
to
remedy
the
defect.
if
it
can
be
made
up
or
if
it
can
be
verified
by
someone
else
then
we
believe
that
the
affidavit
of
mr.
rockler
served
the
purpose.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
one
comment
that
has
appeared
on
the
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
should
appear
after
our
brief
was
filed
in
volume
40
of
the
new
york
university
law
review
at
page
978.
my
knowledge
that
is
the
only
comment
it
has
appeared.
