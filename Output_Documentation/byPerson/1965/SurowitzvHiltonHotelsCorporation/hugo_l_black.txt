(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
the
(inaudible)
affidavit
relates
to
class
action?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
look
at
the
rule
(inaudible)
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
block.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
proof
that
the
complaint
was
false?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
he
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
(inaudible)
shareholder
under
the
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
find
it
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
indication
of
a
collusive
action?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what's
false
with
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
was
she
required
to
swear?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
verified
by
oath
if
the
plaintiff
will
avert?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
rule
said
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
plaintiff
was
set
forth
with
particularities
but
that's
the
compliant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
rule
imposed
it
on
the
present
facts
(inaudible)
that
that
person
is
incompetent
and
if
the
complaint
is
not
collusive
and
if
those
two
things
are
those
that
sworn
it,
how
can
it
be
dismissed
without
showing
that
it
follows
in
saying
it
was
not
collusive?
justice
hugo
l.
black
affidavit
went
on
but
all
that
was
required
were
those
two
things.
justice
hugo
l.
black
wasn't
there
a
finding
that
she
did
not
assume
to
get
corporate
redress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
evidence
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
other
affidavit
shows?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
did
she
protested
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
so
far
as
what
the
rules
require
is
three
things
if
you
say
is
clear
there's
no
evidence
that
anyone
of
them
was
false?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
rule
doesn't
say
anymore
than
that
if
you're
just
going
all
the
rules,
don't
you
have
to
be
governed
by
the
rule
and
keep
within
its
boundaries?
justice
hugo
l.
black
unless
you're
going
on
some
kind
of
(inaudible)
trial
in
the
court
to
punish
her
for
some
kind
of
affidavit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
knew
she
had
thought,
that
she
had
been
told
that
she's
going
to
lose
the
money
on
that
stock.
it's
nothing
going
to
happen
but
why
would
she
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
wasn't
dismissed
for
being
an
inadequate
complaint?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
notice
that
it
have
been,
you
may
say
that
two
people
came
to
--
i
told
them
--
gone
into
this
matter
first
and
then
one
of
them
read
the
complaint
to
the
alleged,
brilliant,
who's
brilliant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
owns
stock?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who's
the
other
man?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
you've
read
what
is
the
matter
here
and
i
got
a
good
deal
of
idea
out
of
it,
(inaudible)
picture
of
this
opinion,
how
long
do
you
think
it
would
take
him
to
educate
her
up
to
the
position
(inaudible)
that
she
could
have
understood
all
of
these
things
and
you
say
you
have
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
was
impossible.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
it
had
been
alright
for
someone
else
to
decide
for
her
to
make
her
affidavit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
of
this
was
based
on
--
on
the
conclusion
of
the
court,
she
was
guilty
of
perjury,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
this
is
false
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
i
assume
by
that
--
does
it
show
or
does
it
have
enough
to
get
the
jury
to
convict
her
of
perjury?
that
would
be
by
a
state
prosecution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
did
present
the
affidavit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
limited,
though
saying
what
they
believe
those
bases
were
truth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
others?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whatever
(voice
overlap)
or
had
if
before
him,
and
in
the
face
of
it,
if
he
hadn't
found
that
punishable
by
something,
he
gave
the
maximum
punishment
possible,
didn't
he?
he
dismissed
the
case
with
perjury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
in
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
to
think
their
right
to
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
believe
your
time
is
up.
