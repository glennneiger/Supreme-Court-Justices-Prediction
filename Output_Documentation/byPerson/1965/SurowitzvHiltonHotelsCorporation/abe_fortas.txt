justice
abe
fortas
does
23
(b)
require
verification
by
the
plaintiff?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
you
did
not
cite
that
in
here?
justice
abe
fortas
what?
justice
abe
fortas
137
federal?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
a
second?
justice
abe
fortas
but
apart
from
that
1905
decision,
you
know
of
anything
else
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
a
1905
decision
wouldn't
be
construing
this
rule?
justice
abe
fortas
we
have
verification
by
counsel
that
might
have
some
meaning
even
in
the
context
of
this
rule,
don't
you
agree
with
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it's
a
little
more
to
23
(b)
than
that
as
i
read
it.
the
other
thing
if
you
have
the
time,
i
wish
you
would
help
--
help
me,
if
you
will
too,
by
pointing
out
in
what
respects
the
affidavit
of
mrs.
surowitz
is
in
conflict
with
her
deposition.
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
argument
but
i
would
like
to
know
that
and
i
take
it
from
what
you
do,
i
correctly
understand
in
what
you
said
earlier
that
her
deposition
is
not
in
conflict
with
the
--
the
specific
affirmations
and
after
being
made
under
23
(b)
subparagraphs
1
and
2?
justice
abe
fortas
sometimes
we
have
difficulty
within
ourselves.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
you
do
get
time,
i'd
like
to
know
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
specs
generally
in
which
the
affidavit
is
contradicted.
justice
abe
fortas
well
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
--
let's
assume
now
that
the
this
is
--
that
the
plaintiff
here
had
verified
this
compliant
and
without
qualification
and
let
--
let
assume
that
from
deposition,
it
appears
that
the
plaintiff
had
no
knowledge
whatsoever
of
the
facts
to
its
plaintiffs
for.
now,
and
--
now,
what
is
the
remedy
for
that
or
is
it
your
position
that
that
should
be
overlooked
completely?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
remedy
other
than
striking
the
complaint?
justice
abe
fortas
what
about
that?
it
is
a
motion
that
dismissed
the
false
verification
that
what
--
assuming
that
the
deposition
demonstrates
that
the
verification
was
false.
what
is
the
remedy
for
that
other
than
dismissal?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
like
counsel
for
mrs.
surowitz
did
not
--
after
the
ruling
he
had
file
another
complaint,
was
a
statute
verified
by
counsel.
was
there
a
statute
of
limitation
is
problem
or
something
of
that
sort?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
assume
there
that
23
(b)
can
be
satisfied
by
verification
counsel,
don't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
although,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
that
mr.
block.
the
affidavit
is
divided
into
two
parts
for
any
medical
purposes.
one
is
the
plaintiffs
are
consistent
with
the
plaintiff
averments
without
the
qualification
and
those
are
specifically
enumerated
paragraphs.
two
is
a
--
the
clarification
relating
to
the
balance
of
the
complaint
which
is
on
information
and
belief,
am
i
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
my
question
i
had
hoped
your
--
that
mr.
watt
could
get
around
of
the
defendant
because
of
shortness
of
time.
my
question
to
you
is
this,
is
it
or
is
it
not
true
that
all
of
the
provisions
in
the
complaint
which
plaintiff
verified
of
our
own
knowledge
were
linked
to
the
statutory
and
rather
formal
matters?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
arguing.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
the
fact.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
interested
in
making
an
argument
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
abe
fortas
that
she
had
what?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
ask
you
the
question
in
different
way.
as
to
each
of
these
specific
matters
in
the
verification
to
which
plaintiff
had
tested
of
her
knowledge
as
to
each
of
those
or
as
to
any
of
those,
is
there
a
contradiction
in
the
deposition
taken
from
mrs.
surowitz
or
does
the
--
or
does
the
contradictory
matter
relate
in
turning
to
the
matters
as
to
which
--
which
she
verified
on
information
and
belief?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
else?
justice
abe
fortas
generally
speaking
plaintiffs
can't
really
testify
as
to
matters
of
control
of
corporation
on
the
basis
of
their
own
information,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
right
now.
justice
abe
fortas
now
second,
so
where
we
are
now
is
that
the
contradiction
between
the
deposition
and
the
affidavit
relates
to
matters
which
are
set
forth
in
the
affidavit
on
information
and
belief,
alright.
now,
did
i
correctly
remember
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
those
matters
which
the
plaintiffs
had
tested
on
information
and
belief
were
false
or
improper
because
the
deposition
shows
that
the
plaintiff
did
not
have
a
general
understanding
of
the
foundation
of
the
complaint?
is
that
the
basis
of
the
decision
below?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
do
you
have
any
on
the
brief,
any
references
to
cases
which
construe
the
meaning
and
the
--
of
an
attestation
on
information
and
belief?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
degree
of
knowledge
that
a
--
an
affiant
has
to
have
to
support
a
--
an
attestation
on
information
and
belief?
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
cases
might
exist
regardless
of
that.
i
don't
know
of
cases
on
that
and
i
was
wondering
whether
you
could
help
me.
so
that
what
we
have
here,
one
view
of
the
case
of
this
case
is
a
question
as
to
the
degree
of
information
necessary
in
a
plaintiff
who
brings
a
representative
action
at
the
purposes
of
rule
23
(b),
degree
of
the
information
if
the
plaintiff
has
to
have
in
order
to
support
a
verification
of
the
complaint
under
23
(b).
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
block,
i
don't
what
to
press
this
beyond
reason
but
i
think
that
it
may
be
helpful
to
us.
if
you
would
turn
on
to
page
236
of
the
transcript
of
record,
that
is
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
last
sentence
of
the
first
full
paragraph
containing,
but
if
the
verification
provision
of
the
rule
has
have
any
real
meaning?
as
the
court
of
appeals
goes
on
to
say
it
requires
that
a
plaintiff
etcetera
must
have
general
knowledge
of
the
wrongful
acts
which
he
alleges
as
a
foundation
for
his
complaint.
do
you
see
where
i'm
reading?
justice
abe
fortas
page
236
of
the
record.
the
record,
page
236
of
the
transcript
of
record,
that's
your
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
page
236
of
the
transcript
of
record
in
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
i'll
read
it
perhaps
you
could
follow
verbally.
this
is
from
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
but
if
the
verification
provision
of
the
rule
is
to
have
any
real
meaning,
it
requires
that
a
plaintiff
must
have
knowledge
of
his
own
position
and
relationship
to
the
suit,
of
the
official
identity
of
the
parties
against
whom
suit
is
brought.
and
in
this
is
what
i
want
to
ask
you
about,
and
that
the
plaintiff
must
have
a
general
knowledge
of
the
wrongful
acts
which
he
alleges
as
a
foundation
for
his
complaint.
now,
is
that
the
summon
substance
of
the
position
that
you
would
take
in
response
to
justice
white's
questions.
justice
abe
fortas
and
where
a
plaintiff
makes
an
allegation
on
information
--
makes
clarification
on
information
and
belief
that
the
plaintiff
must
have
general
knowledge
of
wrongful
acts
which
she
alleges
as
a
foundation
for
the
complaint.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
suppose
plaintiff
does
not
verify
but
his
counsel
verifies.
do
you
concede
that
that
is
a
verification
that
satisfies
23
(b)?
justice
abe
fortas
by
counsel?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
counsel
--
you
know
as
--
as
i
know,
do
you
probably
know
better
than
i
do
that
can
make
the
verification
without
any
qualification,
do
you
mean
that?
justice
abe
fortas
i
get
your
point.
but
in
the
case
then
where
the
plaintiff
for
good
reason
or
bad
reason
the
error
or
misadventure
verifies
that,
you're
saying
that
there
would
be
an
inquiry
under
plaintiff's
knowledge
of
the
substance
of
the
complaint
even
if
it's
an
accounting
case
or
what
not
and
that
unless
the
plaintiff
can
show
a
general
knowledge
of
the
wrongful
acts,
if
the
plaintiff
has
made
verification
on
information
and
belief,
the
complaint
is
to
restrict
her.
that's
the
position.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
the
third
time
you
said
that
sir,
and
i
wonder
if
you
really
want
to
use
those
words.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
the
procurement.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
there's
nothing
in
this
record
on
to
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
oh.
