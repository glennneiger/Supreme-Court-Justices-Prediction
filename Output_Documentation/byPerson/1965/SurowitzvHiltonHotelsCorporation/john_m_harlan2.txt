justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
language
goes
beyond
that,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
were
the
invitations?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'd
like
to
follow
up
just
to
make
sure
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
fortas.
if
this
--
if
this
verification
as
she
made
it,
modified
only
by
it
being
all
on
information
and
beliefs
been
cited
by
mr.
brilliant
or
mr.
rockler
without
any
other
qualification,
you
would
say
that
satisfied
23
(b)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean
what
the
thing
in
reverse
which
is
perhaps
like
justice
white
was
asking
you.
suppose
in
this
verification
by
period
said,
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
leading
out
to
stock
ownership.
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
or
any
of
these
facts.
i
do
not
understand
that
anything
about
the
basis
of
my
cause
of
action
except
that
everything
i
have
said
here
has
been
given
me
by
my
lawyer
and
in
my
own
confidence
with
my
understanding
with
the
investigation.
would
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
that
have
been
alright?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
sit
down.
among
the
invitations
that
you
suggested
--
that
you
stated
that
the
district
court
had
given
you
a
remedy,
this
which
you
claim
as
a
defect,
was
it
specifically
suggested
that
the
--
a
new
complaints
with
an
affidavit
by
counsel
would
suffice
to
cure
this
alleged
defect?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
did
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
that's
a
different
question.
that's
a
different
question.
i'm
not
asking
you
that.
the
concession
that
you
made
now
or
at
least
to
your
--
i
don't
call
it
a
concession,
your
agreement
that
if
this
affidavit
that
this
verification
had
been
made
by
mr.
brilliant
without
qualification
as
it
other
than
information
and
belief
that
that
would
suffice,
was
that
opportunity
given
by
the
district
court?
i
didn't
see
it
in
the
record
and
i
rather
assume
it
was
not
because
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
say
in
its
opinion
that
it
doesn't
pass
on
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
an
affidavit
by
counsel
would
have
suffice?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
your
position
is
clear
on
that
now
as
what
i
was
anxious
to
get
that
that
would
suffice.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
that's
not
quite
for
something
that
as
i
assume
in
the
colloquy
we've
had.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
read
it
that
way
as
supporting
an
opportunity
that
it
did
not
pass.
it
is
expressly
reserved,
did
it
not,
the
question
that
whether
an
affidavit
by
counsel
satisfied
23
(b)?
