mr.
samuel
w.
block
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
affirming
the
order
of
dismissal
entered
by
the
district
judge,
does
not
affect
the
vitality
of
the
cause
of
action
which
the
plaintiff
here
sought
to
enforce.
for
that
cause
of
action
belongs
to
the
corporation.
any
corporate
cause
of
action
still
exists
and
in
fact
is
the
subject
of
a
suit
which
is
presently
pending
in
the
state
of
delaware
which
is
referred
to
at
footnote
at
page
61of
our
brief,
the
blue
brief
which
was
filed
on
behalf
of
the
individual
respondents.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
does
not
affect
even
the
right
of
the
plaintiff
here,
mrs.
surowitz,
to
participate
in
any
judgment
which
might
be
recovered
in
said
other
action
as
a
shareholder.
the
only
result
of
the
order
which
is
here
appealable
is
the
action
of
the
verifier
of
this
derivative
complaint
who
filed
the
false
affidavit
in
purported
compliance
with
rule
23
(b),
perpetrated
a
fraud
on
the
court
and
failed
to
comply
with
the
rules
of
--
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
governing
derivative
action
and
then
refused
to
take
advantage
of
the
invitations
to
cure
those
defects
and
comply
with
the
rules.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
your
honor,
starting
with
the
15
days
which
were
provided
by
the
original
order
of
the
court
to
file
any
documents
which
were
considered
necessary.
then
there
are
references
in
our
brief
to
the
specific
suggestions
of
the
court
below
of
the
district
court
at
--
to
the
plaintiffs,
then
plaintiffs,
now,
petitioner's
counsel
to
file
a
proper
affidavit
and
a
verification
sought
by
someone
who
knew
the
facts
which
were
being
verified
or
obtain
another
plaintiff
because
by
that
time
it
was
clear
that
mr.
brilliant
who
had
filed
this
affidavit
without
in
any
way
verifying
by
oath
the
truth
of
the
allegation,
but
that
mr.
brilliant
was
a
shareholder
in
his
own
right
or
as
a
trustee
or
represented
family
members
of
his
family
who
were
stockholders.
now,
the
specific
statements
of
the
court
are
set
forth
at
pages
19
and
20
of
the
blue
brief
of
--
the
brief
of
the
individual
respondents.
it
was
further
pointed
out
at
the
time
of
the
argument
on
the
findings
and
conclusions
that
the
petitioner
--
that
the
plaintiff
had
not
asked
for
leave
to
file
a
substitute
verification
for
an
amended
complaint.
that
was
the
finding
and
there
was
a
conclusion
that
the
verification
of
this
complaint
is
false
and
sham
and
the
compliant
must
be
strict
since
the
plaintiff
has
not
sought
leave
to
substitute
any
other
verification
or
filed
an
amended
complaint,
the
action
will
be
dismissed
and
the
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
did
not
accept
in
any
way
to
that
finding
or
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
the
--
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
compliant
is
false,
your
honor,
because
that
was
not
before
the
court.
the
verification
was
false
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
your
honor,
i
think
that
she
had
to
swear
to
the
complaint,
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
now,
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
that's
contemporaneous
shareholder.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
no,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
no,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
because
the
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
the
rule
23
(b)
goes
on
to
say
after
those
two
statements
or
let's
say
rather,
it
begins
i
saying
the
complaint
in
a
derivative
action
shall
be
verified
by
oath
and
shall
avert
the
two
specific
allegations
to
which
are
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
the
complaint
was
verified
by
oath
and
it
contained
other
and
necessary
averment,
your
honor.it
would
be
essential
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
no,
it
goes
beyond
that
and
says
the
complaint
shall
set
forth
with
particularity
and
then
the
demands
for
corporate
redress.
then
acceptance,
i
believe.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
because,
your
honor,
the
affidavit
went
on
and
as
the
respondents
here
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
no,
your
honor.
if
the
affidavit
had
been
limited
to
just
the
two
allegations,
the
contemporaneous
shareholding
and
lack
of
collusion,
there
would
not
have
been
--
first
of
all,
there
would
not
have
been
the
necessary
averment
of
attempt
to
obtain
corporate
redress
which
the
rule
goes
on
to
say,
must
be
set
forth
at
particular
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
no,
your
honor.
there
was
no
finding
to
that
effect
and
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
her
--
she
was
asked
what
protest
she
had
made
and
she
was
unable
to
answer
anything
about
that.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
whether
there
been
a
protest
with
a
letter
which
had
been
presented
to
her
by
her
son-in-law,
mr.
brilliant,
to
--
in
which
she
protested
against
the
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
to
the
corporation.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
well,
your
honor,
there
is
the
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
no!
there
is
no
evidence
that
those
three
things
were
false.
but
if
those
three
had
been
the
only
allegations
of
the
compliant,
it
still
would
have
not
be
a
satisfaction
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
no,
your
honor.
that
the
rules
says
it
must
be
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
well,
i
think
there
is
basic
--
the
right
and
i
suggest
to
this
court,
the
duty
of
a
court
to
take
action
where
there
has
been
this
attempted
fraud
where
a
woman
has
been
induced
to
sign
an
affidavit
about
which
she
knew
nothing.
but
we
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
you
can't
go
--
you
really
can't
go
much
beyond
the
fact
that
she
knew
she
had
stock,
your
honor.
and
she
said
the
stock
wasn't
right.
but
the
wrong
which
are
set
forth
in
this
complaint
were
absolutely
essential
in
order
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
if
a
complaint
was
filed
and
all
it
stated
your
honor
was
contemporaneous
stock
ownership,
lack
of
collusion,
and
attempts
to
obtain
corporate
redress
without
alleging
the
wrong.
it
would
not
be
a
complaint.
the
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
it
was
dismissed
because
the
affidavit
which
went
to
the
entire
complaint,
she
listed
33
specific
paragraphs
which
she
said
she
knew
of
her
own
knowledge
to
be
true
and
all
of
the
risk
of
these
--
i
--
almost
a
hundred
pages
i
think
the
complaint
is.
complaint,
she
knew
to
be
true
on
information
which
she
believes
to
be
true.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
i
think
your
honor
that
it
can
be
so
argued
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
well
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
i
think
that
the
question
of
control
which
is
directly
contained
in
the
formal
allegation
with
respect
to
attempts
to
obtain
corporate
redress,
although,
she
said
she
had
knowledge
of
that,
she
did
not.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
she
did
not
--
i'm
sorry.
that
she
did
not
know
this
of
her
own
knowledge.
the
fact
that
the
corporation
was
under
the
control
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
the
allegation
with
respect
to
corporate
control
in
the
--
being
in
the
hands
of
these
defendants
is
something
she
testified
she
--
she
forted
and
with
which
she
testified
to
she
didn't
know
anything
about
it.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
i
don't
recall
any
at
this
moment,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
well
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
--
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
your
honor,
i
--
i
submit
that
the
basis
of
the
decision
is
that
the
affidavit
which
was
filed
here
was
false.
not
that
this
plaintiff
had
to
have
knowledge
of
any
specific
fact
but
that
she
sworn
under
oath
that
she
had
information
as
to
certain
facts
and
belief
in
those
facts
which
she
did
not
have.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
no,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
no.
no,
we
do
not
because
there
was
no
degree
of
knowledge
whatsoever.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
absolutely
not.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
issue
is,
if
i
may
change
it
slightly
the
question
of
whether
the
verifier
must
have
that
degree
of
information
and
the
degree
of
legal.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
no,
your
honor.
no,
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
we
would
accept
that
verification
if
when
you
went
to
the
plaintiff
and
if
she
signed
the
verification.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
no,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
sufficient,
your
honor.
no,
i
don't.
i
think
that
if
the
lawyer
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
we
need
to
go
nearly
that
far.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
you
still
have
it.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
this
case
stops
far
short
of
that.
i
think
anyone
of
these
instances
when
you
have
a
rule
some
cases
are
one
side
of
a
line
and
some
on
the
other.
in
this
case,
it
was
not
an
affidavit
that
this
is
what
my
lawyer
told
me.
this
was
an
affidavit
of
what
i
knew
for
33
paragraphs,
what
i,
the
plaintiffs,
knew
and
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
well,
i
think
that
--
that
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
is
quite
correct
when
he
says
that
the
rule
11,
after
the
rule
11
certification
covers
what
the
lawyer
said.
the
lawyer
must
go
beyond
that
your
honor
and
provide
that
degree
of
verification
by
vote
which
rule
23
required.
and
i
would
like
to
point
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
no,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
and
we
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
--
and
we
have
the
same
set
of
facts
that
we
--
here
have
where
she
had
no
knowledge,
information,
and
belief
or
knowledge
at
all.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
you
cannot
tell
that
from
the
deposition,
your
honor.
she
--
she
said
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
because
she
said
she
did
have
knowledge
in
one
and
information
and
belief
as
to
the
rest.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
no,
your
honor.
because
we
had
a
rule
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
well,
there
is
a
rule
of
law
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
that
if
you
state
under
oath
something
to
be
true
which
you
do
not
know
to
be
true,
that
is
in
law
fault.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
no,
your
honor.
that
would
be
equally
applicable
to
those
where
she
has
said
i
have
information
and
belief
as
to
these
allegations
and
had
not
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
i
have.
now,
if
i
can't
--
i
have
the
page
your
honor.
i
just
don't
have
exactly
where
you're
reading
from.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
the
last
sentence
of
the
first
full
paragraph.
would
your
honor
read
it
again?
mr.
samuel
w.
block
when
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
where
the
plaintiff
has
verified,
yes.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
if
it
is
verification
without
any
qualification.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
by
counsel.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
i
mean
without
the
qualification
that
was
in
mr.
rockler's
affidavit
here
but
in
which
he
said,
i
make
this
solely
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
a
mid
state
under
something
like
that
and
i
reserve
all
the
attorney
client
privileges
and
the
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
that's
right.
and
your
honor,
there
is
--
the
very
good
reason
for
that.
the
derivative
action
in
which
these
verifications
are
required
has
been
referred
to
as
having
peculiarities
by
this
court.
it
is
a
--
it's
a
different
breed
really
of
lawsuits
because
it
requires
the
individual
to
take
over
as
it
were
the
control
from
the
court
--
from
the
elected
corporate
managers.
now,
there
must
be,
we
respectfully
suggests,
some
assurance
that
that
kind
of
taking
over
of
corporate
control
is
based
upon
the
allegations
of
wrongdoing
which
someone,
some
person,
responsible
is
willing
to
verify
under
oath.
and
that
is
why
the
answer
to
the
question
about
whether
if
it's
a
verification
must
there
be
that
general
knowledge.
you
--
the
person
who
is
saying,
i'm
going
to
take
over
this
cause
of
action,
must
be
willing
to
say,
i
feel
these
are
responsible
allegation.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
yes.
because
i
think
that
that
you
would
have
a
responsible
person
who
would
make
the
affidavit
and
it
would
not
be
the
basic
fraud
on
the
court.
there
would
not
be
the
concern
for
what
here
appears,
i
respectfully
suggest,
to
be
a
kind
of
trafficking
in
litigation
which
is
deprived
by
the
earliest
of
the
cases.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
i
think
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
no,
your
honor.
i
think
once
again,
you
would
not
have
had
the
degree
of
responsibility
for
the
charges
that
is
required.
there
is
no
restriction
as
has
been
suggested
by
counsel
for
the
petition
on
the
use
of
a
procedural
rule
to
impose
on
an
uneducated
plaintiff
a
very
substantial
obstacle
to
bringing
a
derivative
suit.
this
could
have
been
verified
by
anyone
with
knowledge
of
the
facts
that
were
--
that
were
alleged
on
knowledge
to
be
in
the
knowledge
of
affiant
or
on
information
and
belief
as
to
those
others.
the
legal
flow
here
is
that
someone
procured
this
plaintiff
to
execute
this
false
affidavit.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
the
false
affidavit?
mr.
samuel
w.
block
well,
we
don't
know.
all
you
can
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
well,
there's
an
affidavit
by
mr.
brilliant
that
he
--
and
i
want
to
--
want
to
be
sure
i
have
the
exact,
that
he
would
look
into
the
facts
and
decide
what
should
be
done.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
and
then
there
the
steps
from
that
point
forward.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
brilliant
was
her
son-in-law
who
was
a
lawyer,
graduate
lawyer.
he
had
master's
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
he
own
stocks.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
the
other
man
was
her
attorney
--
one
of
her
attorneys,
mr.
rockler.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
how
long
it
would
have
taken.
it
may
have
taken
--
it
may
have
been
impossible
but
it
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
then
mr.
brilliant
could
have
executed
an
honest
affidavit.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
yes,
sir.
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
because
his
affidavit
is
--
it's
absolutely
without
mention
of
the
truth
of
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
any
of
them.
the
only
fact
he
swears
to
is
that,
i
told
mrs.
surowitz
that
we
have
done
this.
he
--
and
i
don't
--
whether
it
is
clarified,
i
can't
tell
but
at
least
it
appears
to
me
that
they
drawn
so
that
he
does
not
say
under
the
necessary
oath
that
these
facts
are
either
true
or
i
believed
to
be
true.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
no,
but
the
paragraph
in
which
that
appears
your
honor
reads,
i
told
her
that
the
charges
in
the
complaint
reflected
the
investigation
and
study
of
mr.
rockler
and
myself
and
that
in
my
opinion,
the
charges
of
wrong
doing
was
soundly
based.
he
is
swearing
that
he
told
her
this
and
i
don't
question
it.
i
have
no
way
of
questioning
that
that
is
true
or
is
not
true.
but
he
does
not
say
that
under
oath,
he
says
that
the
charges
were
true.
he
merely
says
under
oath,
i
told
her,
that
in
my
opinion,
the
charges
of
wrong
doing
was
soundly
based.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
i
don't
know
that
we
go
that
far,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
its
a
false
affidavit,
yes.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
i
don't
know
that
sir.
i
can't
answer
that
question.
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
the
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
--
questions
were
made
at
the
trial
level
that
the
--
that
mr.
brilliant
who
was
himself
have
substantial
stockholder
could
have
executed
the
complaint
as
a
duly
qualified
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
i
don't
think
that
there
was
ever
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
yes,
because
as
the
trial
court
said,
all
i
want
is
an
affiant
or
a
plaintiff
who
knows
what
she
said
she
knew.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
well,
if
there's
no
limitation
on
who
the
affiant
might
be,
mr.
justice
harlan.
it
doesn't
say
that
it
has
to
be
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
yes,
because
that
was
never
presented
to
her.
there
was
never
an
opportunity
for
that
issue
because
they
kept
the
false
affidavit
before
the
court.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
limited
in
each
instance,
your
honor
--
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
not
mr.
brilliant.
mr.
brilliant
does
not
say
that.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
mr.
rockler
said
he
believed
that
it
would
be
true
but
he
made
it
for
a
limited
purpose
and
without
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
well,
your
honor
i
think
that
raises
another
question
which
will
--
have
not
reached.what
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
w.
block
that
the
--
the
order
of
dismissal
is
with
perjury
but
it
does
not
affect
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
samuel
w.
block
that's
right.
