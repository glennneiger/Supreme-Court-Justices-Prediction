mr.
richard
kilbourne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
your
honors.
i
would
--
i
would
say
at
the
outset,
that
had
the
petitioners
in
this
case
been
refused
all
the
services
that
they
requested
at
the
library
at
the
time
they
went
in
and
they've
been
just
arbitrarily
refused
any
recognition
or
any
service
and
asked
to
leave,
i
can
assure
you
that
this
case
will
not
be
here
today.
in
fact,
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
case.
if
they
hold
the
state,
the
state
of
louisiana's
entire
case
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
went
in
to
the
library
and
requested
service.
they
requested
a
book
and
it
was
later
ascertained
that
the
book
by
that
specific
title
did
not
exist,
but
a
similar
book
did
exist
which
was
--
was
sent
to
them
and
its
position
of
the
state
of
course
is
that
was
all
that
they
had
asked
for.
they
had
no
further
business
there
and
when
they
just
--
just
sat
there
and
looked,
vacant
stares
into
space,
the
librarian
testified
that
she
repeated
statement
that
they
didn't
have
the
book
and
that
she
would
try
to
get
it
--
get
it
for
them.
and
when
she
repeated
--
repeated
it
the
second
time,
and
they
did
nothing.
they
just
sat
there.
that
is
when
she
asked
them
to
leave.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
no,
there
is
nothing
at
all
in
the
record
and
that
--
that
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
well
substantially,
i
believe
that
would
be
correct,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
kilbourne
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it
would
be
substantially
correct
that
she
said
that
she
assumed
when
she
took
the
order
for
the
book
that
they
would
leave
and
when
they
did
not,
she
asked
them
to
leave.
now,
of
course,
this
is
--
mr.
richard
kilbourne
well
at
that
time,
it
was
a
kind
of
arrangement
by
three
parishes
to
--
to
have
this
library,
they
voted
a
tax
to
maintain
it.
they
call
it
the
audubon
regional
library.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
no,
sir,
it
was
essentially,
it's
just
to
supply
books
and
that
is
just
about
all
it
did
to
--
to
serve
the
--
they
did
have
branches
of
--
branches,
small
branch
of
library
in
st.
francis
building
in
west
louisiana
parish.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
it
was
a
--
i
believe
there
was
one
table
and
two
chairs,
i
believe
in
there.
i
believe
they
said
there
were
two
chairs
in
it.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
well
they
sir,
it
must
have
been
about,
--
about
15
by
20.
it's
rather
a
small
room,
it
would
be
for
a
law
office.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
one
room
there,
yes
sir,
where
the
--
where
the
--
in
the
--
the
lady,
mrs.
reeves
who
was
there,
i
mean
that's
what
she
did.
she
sat
there
at
her
desk,
and
when
people
came
in,
she
took
their
orders.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
she
was
the
only
one
there
at
that
time.
the
head
librarian
was
in
the
back
room.
there
were
several
rooms
to
the
building,
all
small
rooms,
i
think
maybe
--
maybe
four
rooms
all
together
that
they
get
there
--
mr.
richard
kilbourne
no
sir,
there
was
no
other
room,
that
was
the
only
room
where
they
took
the
orders
for
the
books.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
well
they
were
used
for
the
library,
i
mean,
where
they
had
the
early
employees
working
and
where
they
had
kept
their
records
and
the
administrative
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
kilbourne
yes,
they
--
they
had
to
keep
the
books
on
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
kilbourne
they
had
books
--
mr.
richard
kilbourne
they
had
books
in
the
main
room
alright
and
they
had
them
in
the
back
rooms
too
and
which
would
not
open
to
anyone.
and
the
books
that
they
didn't
have
well
they
order
them
and
as
they
said,
they
even
put
them
on
one
of
the
--
the
order
from
the
state
library.
they
--
they
have
many
other
kind
of
–
they
have
a
photograph
records,
tape
recordings,
all
that
is
supplied
at
the
public
by
mail.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
there
were
only
two
people
in
the
whole
establishment
that
day.
mrs.
reeves,
the
lady
there,
she's
on
duty
there.
it
was
on
a
saturday
morning.
they
close
at
12
o'clock
and
i
believe
this
thing
took
place
by
11:30
in
the
morning.
and
then
the
other
lady,
mrs.
perkins
who
was
at
that
time,
the
head
librarian
was
in
one
of
the
back
rooms.
and
that
was
the
only
--
those
were
the
only
two
people
in
the
building.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
i
believe
the
record
--
i
believe
the
record
does
show
that
that
was
a
--
that
was
one
of
the
programs
instituted
by
the
congress
of
racial
equality.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
well,
--
mr.
richard
kilbourne
it's
not
going
to
be
--
mr.
richard
kilbourne
well,
it's
not
going
to
[attempt
to
laughter]
--
i
--
i
really
don't
believe
it's
going
to
be
one
specific
page
and
one
sentence.
now
one
of
the
–
was
called
as
a
witness
by
the
state
and
i
spent
--
if
i
was
of
course
prosecuting
the
case
and
i
spent
a
great
long
time,
many
question
--
great
many
questions
trying
to
develop
this
and
it
was
in
the
record.
i
don't
know
if
it's
in
this
record
but
the
piece
from
the
next
day
paper
where
this
witness
had
stated
by
sunday
morning
that
newspaper
had
stated
that
this
was
a
program
of
the
congress
of
racial
equality.
it
was
a
demonstration
planned
by
them
and
that
was
introduced
in
the
record
in
the
lower
court.
now
this
particular
witness
who
would
give
the
statement
to
the
paper,
she
wasn't
a
friendly
witness
and
i
don't
know
--
i
asked
her
so
many
questions,
i
lost
--
lost
count
myself.
but
that
was
--
but
i
believe
that
the
record
is
--
mr.
richard
kilbourne
miriam
finegold.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
i
believe
–
mr.
richard
kilbourne
well
yes,
i
believe
the
sheriff
--
now
what
the
sheriff
testified
to
as
the
best
of
my
recollection
and
i
reviewed
this
several
times,
was
that
he
had
received
a
telephone
call
if
there
was
going
to
be
--
something
was
going
to
happen
at
the
library.
and
he
didn't,
if
i
remember
right,
he
didn't
--
he
wasn't
told
what
it
was.
he
wasn't
told
it
--
it
was
going
to
attempt
to
integrate
the
library
or
anything
of
that
kind.
he
just
told
him
something
was
going
to
happen.
but
i
may
say
so
and
i
believe
this
is
in
the
record
too.
the
sheriff
testified
--
i
remember
that
he
testified
that
on
previous
occasion
when
they
have
had
the
demonstrations
of
any
kind
by
the
congress
of
racial
equality
that
he
was
advised
in
advance
because
obviously
there
was
always
a
possibility
of
something
that
might
get
out
at
hand
and
that
was
to
enable
him
to
take
precautions
to
preserve
the
peace.
and
i
believe
the
--
the
people
themselves,
members
of
the
congress
of
racial
equality
often
called
him
and
told
him
that
they
were
going
to
have
pickets
on
the
street,
something
or
whatever
they're
going
to
do
and
want
police
protection
and
i
don't
mind
saying
they
called
me
too.
well
often
not.
that
wasn't
so
--
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
i
--
i
think
if
the
record
would
demonstrate
that
it
was
or
one
of
the
--
mr.
richard
kilbourne
no,
sir,
except
in
this
way,
the
question
of
whether
it
was
a
preconceived
plan
to
conduct
himself
in
such
a
manner
as
would
forcibly
disturb
the
peace
and
which
is
what
i
believe
was
charged
in
here.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
i
would
--
yes,
i
believe
that
they
can.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
well
that's
a
representation
of
the
state
of
louisiana
which
i
make
and
which
i
certainly
stand
by
it.
of
course
they
only
have
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
kilbourne
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
no
sir,
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
i
really
--
i
just
couldn't
answer
that
--
mr.
richard
kilbourne
in
other
words,
it
works
--
mr.
richard
kilbourne
well
it's
in
the
--
well
i
say
it's
not
segregated
because
if
a
white
person
wants
to
use
that
blue
bookmobile,
they
would
let
him
use
it.
if
a
colored
person
want
to
use
the
red
bookmobile,
i
know
color
is
wrong
there
but
i
believe
that's
right,
they
would
certainly
wouldn't
be
able
to
refuse
them
service.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
i
believe
--
it
is.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
i
believe
it
is.
now
you
have
to
--
you
see
this
certainly
would
come
up
actually
before.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
sir?
mr.
richard
kilbourne
well
i
--
i
do
not
believe
that
that
would
be
--
mr.
richard
kilbourne
yes.
i
believe
–
mr.
richard
kilbourne
i
think
she
--
i
believe
she
did
testify
that
--
mr.
richard
kilbourne
well,
that
--
i
believe
that
would
be
the
only
testimony
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
well
i
--
i
often
get
confused
when
you
--
when
you
segregated
system
or
integrated
system
because
in
louisiana
--
i
always
feel
like
we
had
more
integration
in
the
place
and
then
probably
any
place
in
the
united
states,
i
mean,
just
when
the
way
people
live.
i
don't
--
segregation
and
integration
seems
to
mean
different
things
and
different
policy
on
contrary.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
you
mean
to
get
a
book?
mr.
richard
kilbourne
they
all
went
in
there
because
--
mr.
richard
kilbourne
i
don't
believe
i
had,
no
sir.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
no,
i
really
can't
--
i
can't
explain
why
that
could
be
accepted.
as
i
see
it
was
–
there's
no
doubt
it
was
a
custom
that
they
did
not
go
in
there
at
the
library
at
that
time.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
yes
it
is.
the
bookmobile
still
operates.
they
close
the
--
they
closed
this
facility,
they
closed
ones
in
west
louisiana
and
st.
helena
parish
principally
for
the
reason
that
they
couldn't
get
anyone
to
work
there.
the
--
the
only
people
that
work
in
these
facilities
or
were
working
in
them
were
women
and
they
weren't
paid
much
and
--
mr.
richard
kilbourne
they
were
white
women,
yes
sir.
well
they
have
colored
women
working
in
there
too.
not
in
the
branches
but
in
the
--
in
the
clinton
--
to
where
clinton
is.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
only
one
woman
then,
i
think
it
is
time
they
were
white.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
that's
not
what
i'm
saying.
i'm
saying
they
wouldn't
work
in
that
because
they
anticipated
that
it
would
be
trouble
and
they
didn't
want
to
have
any
part
of
it
and
that
was
the
reason.
they
were
just
scared
to
work
in
there
either.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
yes,
i
guess
we
are.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
i
didn't
quite
understand
all
your
questions.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
no
sir.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
well
i
don't
think
there's
any
--
any
other
testimony
to
that
effect.
it
was
i
think
--
if
i
remember
the
record
will
show
you
the
number
of
questions
along
those
lines
that
was
objected
to
and
the
objection
was
sustained.
i
objected
to
them
because
--
mr.
richard
kilbourne
i
did.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
yes
sir
because
i
didn't
feel
like
--
i
didn't
feel
like
i
was
trying
to
raise
a
case
or
anything
to
that
kind.
i
thought
it
was
irrelevant
because
actually
all
--
we
--
my
theory
of
the
case
was
that
anybody
that
went
into
the
library
conducted
themselves
in
the
manner
that
the
petitioners
did
in
this
case
would
be
violating
the
statute.
well
ku
klux
klan
when
they've
come
in
and
say
i'm
a
man
conducted
themselves
that
way,
i
believe
you
would
have
the
same
kind
of
case.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
not
in
my
judgment,
your
honor.
i
believe
anybody
who'd
acted
that
way
would
--
would
receive
the
same
thing.
that's
why
i
--
i
maintain
that
the
question
of
the
color
of
the
petitioners
was
irrelevant
and
the
question
of
segregation
and
integration
not
only
--
only
testimony
that
i
remember
about
the
question
of
the
integration
came
up
and
it
shares
the
testimony
when
he
said
that
one
of
the
petitioners
had
told
them
that
they
came
over
there
to
integrate
the
library
and
that
was
what
he
said
one
of
them
told
him.
and
that
--
wasn't
all
that
took
place
on
his
questioning
of
the
petitioners
after
--
after
the
arrest
i
believe
is
an
abuse
of
them.
i
think
one
of
them
told
them
he
couldn't
read
and
so
that's
why
i
really
didn't
--
mr.
richard
kilbourne
well
i
--
i
certainly
had
the
--
actually,
i
certainly
knew
what
the
situation
was
if
you
permit
me
to
say
so
as
far
as
the
racial
situation
was
but
in
trying
the
case,
i
maintain
that
the
race
of
the
petitioners
had
nothing
to
with
because
i
had
the
--
anyone
who
had
conducted
themselves
in
a
similar
manner
[inaudible]
five
strange
men
or
four
of
them
go
in
in
and
lady
there
them
in
the
library
by
set
and
walk
in
and
--
and
just
sit
down
and
refused
to
leave.
well
of
course,
she
was
afraid
and
anyone
would
be
and
my
theory
was
and
it
still
is,
if
anyone
who
conducted
themselves
in
that
manner
would
certainly
be
conducting
in
a
manner
that
would
conceivably
provoke
a
disturbance
of
the
peace
and
at
all
times,
i
was
trying
to
prove
if
they
--
it
would
be
absolutely
there
with
the
intent
to
which
i
charge
to
provoke
a
disturbance
of
the
peace.
now
i
did
want
to
mention
about
the
--
what
i
said
about
the
--
mr.
richard
kilbourne
as
i
said
in
the
opening
--
mr.
richard
kilbourne
as
i
said
in
my
opening
statement,
the
case
would
not
be
here
today,
there
would
not
had
been
a
case.
now
that's
exactly
what
the
situation
would
have
been.
now
the
talk
--
the
order
--
there
was
some
discussions
here
affecting
about
the
constitution.
this
man
mentioned
the
constitution.
now
there's
some
confusion
about
just
what
he
meant.
you
see
only
one
of
them
the
--
brown
was
the
only
who
spoke
to
us
and
the
others
and
the
other
petitioners
don't
said
anything
at
all.
and
when
they
asked
him
to
leave,
the
librarian
asked
them
to
leave,
he
said
what
about
the
constitution.
now
just
what
he
meant,
he
never
knew
because
none
of
them
--
none
of
the
petitioners
ever
testified
but
my
theory
was
that
he
was
trying
to
convey
to
her
the
--
the
--
his
idea
that
the
constitution
gave
him
a
right
to
--
to
conduct
himself
in
a
manner
that
he
was
doing
and
she
--
and
her
answer
was,
we
have
--
we
have
it
here.
now
that
was
his
[inaudible]
mr.
richard
kilbourne
about
1500
people.
mr.
richard
kilbourne
sir?
mr.
richard
kilbourne
i
believe
it
does.
she's
a
middle
