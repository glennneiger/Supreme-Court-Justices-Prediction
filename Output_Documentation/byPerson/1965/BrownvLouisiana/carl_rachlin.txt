under

for
writs
of
mandamus
certiorari
in
prohibition
which
writs
were
denied
without

as
referred
to
in
the
record
below.
mr.
carl
rachlin
the
sentence
is
brown
received
a
$150
or
90
days.
the
other
four
petitioners
received,
i
think
it
was
$35
and
15
days.
mr.
carl
rachlin
or
--
and
--
i
thought
it
was
$150
or
90.
mr.
carl
rachlin
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
may
3,
1965
and
they
brought
all
appropriate
proceedings
in
the
court
below.
the
various
constitutional
and
federal
questions
were
raised
which
i
hope
to
refer
to
during
the
course
of
my
presentation.
on
saturday,
march
7,
1964,
shortly
before
noon,
the
parish
sheriff
in
clinton,
louisiana,
mr.
doughty
saw
the
petitioners,
all
negroes,
go
past
his
place
of
office
of
business.
the
sheriff
testified
that
he
had
been
expecting
them
all
morning.
he
further
testified
that
he
had
heard
that
they,
as
members
of
the
congress
of
racial
equality,
were
going
to
integrate
the
public
library
in
clinton,
louisiana.
as
soon
as
he
saw
them
on
the
street
go
past
his
place
of
private
business
and
enter
the
library
which
is
just
a
short
distance
from
his
place
of
business,
he
called
the
jail
and
directed
his
deputies
to
proceed
to
the
library,
and
he
himself
shortly
thereafter
within
a
matter
of
moments
went
himself.
the
sheriff
had
testified
below
that
up
until
that
moment,
he
had
never
observed
any
negroes
enter
the
--
this
library
which
is
part
of
a
three
parish
system
involving
three
buildings
and
two
bookmobiles.
mr.
carl
rachlin
two
bookmobiles,
mobile
library
systems
which
i
will
refer
to
in
a
moment.
the
three
branches,
the
clint
--
the
one
and
which
we
are
concerned
with
here
was
the
administrative
office
of
the
three
parish
library
system
known
as
the
audubon
library.
and
there
was
a
--
in
addition
to
the
administrative
office,
there
was
a
library
there
as
well
as
in
two
other
communities
and
two
bookmobiles,
a
red
one
for
white
persons
and
a
blue
one
for
negro
persons
and
the
blue
bookmobile
as
the
testimony
in
the
record
has
been
--
has
indicated
serves
and
has
registered
all
the
negroes
in
the
parishes,
the
three
parishes
with
which
we
are
concerned.
the
testimony
also
indicated
that
if
a
white
person
had
come
to
the
blue
--
blue
bookmobile,
that
is
the
one
for
negroes,
such
a
person
was
refer
either
to
the
red
bookmobile,
that
is
for
whites
or
to
one
of
the
branches.
the
negroes
weren't,
according
to
the
testimony,
were
never
known
up
to
this
moment
to
have
used
any
of
the
branch
libraries.
in
any
event,
brown
and
the
other
petitioners
herein
entered
the
library
and
when
met
and
i
quote
from
the
record
by
just
giving
the
testimony
of
the
librarian,
“between
the
tables
by
mrs.
reeves,
the
librarian”
and
this
was
in
what
was
term
by
the
administrative
official
of
the
library
as
the
adult
reading
room
which
has
sometimes
been
in
the
record
below,
been
called
the
lobby.
mr.
carl
rachlin
at
the
moment
she
was
alone,
sir,
yes.
mr.
carl
rachlin
five
persons
entered
the
library,
all
negro.
she
was
--
her
testimony
was
that
she
was
alone.
however,
at
one
point,
the
sheriff
indicated
that
he
wasn't
certain
--
he
may
have
--
may
or
may
not
have
seen
another
person
enter
but
then
the
testimony
was
vague
and
that
the
hard
testimony
was
precise,
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
library
at
that
time.
mr.
carl
rachlin
she
was
--
no
she
wasn't.
she
was
moving
around
the
library
and
as
i
indicated,
apparently,
she
met
them
between
the
reading
room
--
reading
table
of
some
eight
by
four
and
her
desk
in
that
room.
in
any
event,
brown
asked
her
for
a
book.
mrs.
reeves
testified
that
she
went
to
the
index
system
and
was
not
able
to
find
the
book
and
indicated
that
she
would
have
the
book
sent
to
brown
after
she
ascertained
that
he
had
been
a
registered
member
of
the
library.
mr.
carl
rachlin
the
book
was
a
book
by
a
well
known
negro
writer;
arna
bontemps
entitled
“the
story
of
the
negro.”
there
is
a
little
conflict
of
testimony
as
to
what
took
place
thereafter.
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes,
your
honor.
the
state
indic
--
the
librarian
indicated
that
that
there
was
some
confusion
about
the
name
but
i
think
if
you
permit
me,
sir,
the
record
shows
that
the
library
actually
obtained
the
book
from
one
of
the
state
institution
either
louisiana
state
university
or
tulane
and
in
fact
as
the
record
--
as
it
was
admitted
into
evidence
in
the
record,
the
book
was
mailed
to
mr.
brown
with
a
card
saying
that
he
could
either
return
it
by
a
mail
or
he
could
return
it
to
the
blue
bookmobile.
that
is
part
of
the
record
of
this
(voice
overlap)
mr.
carl
rachlin
they're
very
close
but
not
identical,
sir.
there's
no
question.
it
was
not
the
same
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
well,
i
--
it
is
hard
to
explain
that.
i
think
the
only
answer
is
that
the
stenographer
below
did
not
correctly
get
the
name
of
the
author.
the
author's
name,
if
--
if
you
look
at
the
--
there
is
a
--
a
certain
overlapping
of
the
names
between
the
name
that
--
wrote
down
and
the
name
of
the
book
in
fact
and
i
think
that
was
more
--do
more.
mr.
carl
rachlin
it's
very
close
to
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
but
--
i
think
the
examination
shows
certain
and
probably
was
in
fact
the
same
book
that
was
merely
a
stenographic
error
in
the
court
below.
but
i
--
that
is
of
no
significance
because
there's
no
question
that
we
don't
and
we
don't
question
whether
the
book
was
or
was
not
there.
we
think
that
is
highly
irrelevant
to
the
proceeding
and
we're
not
disputing
that
mrs.
reeves
--
i
don't
--
we
don't
claim
for
a
moment
that
mrs.
reeves
attempted
to
in
some
way
prevaricate
the
truth.
mr.
carl
rachlin
the
title
is
very
similar
and
i
think
it
was
a
similar
subject
matter.
mr.
carl
rachlin
well
one
was
the
--
the
story
of
a
negro
by
arna
bontemps,
i
can
give
you
the
correct
title
of
the
--
i
have
that
here.
after
she
met
them
between
the
tables,
they
asked
her
for
a
book
and
what
--
the
--
the
way
it
reads
in
the
record
on
page
97,
question,
what
is
the
name
of
the
book
that
one
of
the
accused
asked
for?
answer,
i
copied
it
from
the
paper
he
handed
me,
wendall
arna,
the
story
of
the
negro:
bontems.
now
the
reason
i
suggest
without
actually
knowing
so
they
did
not
participate
in
the
trial
is
that
arna
bontemps
is
a
well
known
negro
author
and
i
think
the
whole
thing
was
just
a
stenographic
confusion
with
the
name
that
was
not
at
that
time
known
to
the
--
the
--
to
the
–
to
the
actual
stenographer.
mr.
carl
rachlin
now
the
actual
book
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
--
just
for
a
moment,
sir.
yes,
on
112
when
--
on
cross-examination
of
the
administrative
head
of
the
library,
mrs.
perkins,
the
question
was,
i
asked
her
in
form
of
a
statement.
i'll
show
you
what
purports
to
be
a
postcard
of
the
united
states
postal
service
addressed
--
i'll
skip
a
few
words
to
henry
brown,
jackson,
louisiana
which
reads
“memo
to
henry
brown
from
the
audubon
regional
library,
bookmobile
number
two.
we
are
mailing
to
you
on
the
separate
cover
the
copy
of
arna
bontemps:
the
story
of
the
negro.
and
then,
neither
the
audubon
nor
the
state
library
could
verify
such
a
title
by
wendall.
you
--
you
may
return
the
book
either
by
mail
or
to
the
book
--
the
blue
bookmobile
whichever
way
is
most
convenient.”
i
suggest
though,
i
don't
think
it's
significant
that
this
was
just
a
confusion
over
the
correct
name
of
the
author.
in
any
event
as
i've
indicated
and
as
the
record
shows,
the
choice
of
return
was
not
in
person
to
the
library
but
either
to
the
blue
--
blue
bookmobile,
the
negro
bookmobile
or
to
the
--
through
the
mails.
in
any
event,
at
this
point,
mrs.
reeves
wasn't
certain
whether
brown
asked
to
see
the
united
states
constitution.
she
asked
brown
and
the
others
to
leave
and
they
indicated
that
they
would
not.
they
indicated
that
she
testified
quite
clearly
that
all
during
this
time,
they
maintained
absolute
quiet.
there
was
no
unusual
conduct
or
any
disorderly
conduct
--
conduct
of
any
kind.
no
boisterous
talk.
no
noise
talks
because
these
all
comes
from
the
testimony
of
mrs.
reeves
by
the
way
as
well
as
the
other
witnesses
who
testified
in
behalf
of
the
state.
she
called
her
superior
and
he
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
she
asked
them
to
leave.
mr.
carl
rachlin
that
is
correct.
she
did
not
ask
him
to
leave
prior
to
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
there
was
no
refusal
to
take
the
order,
certainly
that
was
true.
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
rachlin
well,
there
was
some
question
as
to
whether
they
have
–
they
had
asked
to
see
the
united
states
constitution
because
the
sheriff
later
testified
that
when
he,
at
the
time
he
asked
them
to
leave,
brown
and
one
of
the
others
who
was
not
identified
by
the
sheriff
said
they
wanted
service
and
the
sheriff
refers
specifically
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
request
discussion
about
the
united
states
constitution
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
librarian
herself
when
she
--
that
is
the
administrative
head
of
the
library,
when
she
testified
after
mrs.
reeves,
she
also
testified
there
was
discussion
about
the
united
states
constitution.
so
that
when
i
answered
your
question,
it
was
not
meant
to
be
a
base
of
it
but
merely
that
there
was
further
discussion
unquestionably
and
--
but
there
wasn't
--
sir,
i
can't
honestly
say
that
she
refused
to
permit
them
to
see
the
united
states
constitution.
she
did
however
agree
to
take
the
order.
and
that
order,
as
i
--
as
the
record
shows
was
in
fact
filled
by
mail.
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes.
please
bear
with
me
for
a
moment.
i
had
it
in
my
notes.
mr.
carl
rachlin
well
in
any
event,
mrs.
--
mrs.
--
mrs.
perkins,
the
administrative
head
of
the
library,
indicated
that
there
were
couple
of
tables
in
this
room
variously
referred
to
as
the
adult
reading
room,
but
i
think
mr.
kilbourne
at
the
trial
as
the
lobby
and
the
record
on
101
indicates
that
they
were
both
talking
about
the
same
room
when
he
was
questioning
mrs.
perkins.
and
that,
from
time
to
time
the
public
did
sit
in
the
reading
room
and
--
and
do
whatever
people
customarily
do
in
libraries.
as
mrs.
perkins
came
out,
there
was
this
talk
about
the
constitution.
i
think
that
is
referred
to,
your
honor,
on
page
104,
i
think
is
where
--
let
me
see
--
well
that's
where
--
i'm
sorry,
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
accurate.
mr.
carl
rachlin
well
mrs.
--
well
mrs.
perkins
also
referred
to
the
constitution
--
oh
yes
--
yes,
on
108,
your
honor,
near
at
the
top
of
the
page,
question,
of
course
a
question
by
mr.
bell
here,
isn't
a
fact
that
the
defendant,
mr.
brown
--
henry
brown
asked
you
for
a
book
on
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
he
didn't
answer.
he
did
not
ask
me
for
a
book
on
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
question
-
didn't
you
previously
testify
about
the
constitution?
he
said
to
me,
what
about
the
constitution
which
your
reply
was
that
we
owned
it
--
that
we
owned
the
copy
that
we
owned
several
copies.
in
any
event,
mrs.
perkins
then
shortly
thereafter
asked
them
to
leave.
and
again,
in
--
in
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
this
was
--
this
was
after
they
were
asked
to
leave
by
mrs.
reeves.
mrs.
perkins
came
out
after
they
refused
to
leave
when
mrs.
reeves
--
after
mrs.
reeves'
conversation.
in
any
event,
mrs.
perkins
asked
them
to
leave
and
again,
as
i
say,
there
was
this
little
conversation
about
the
constitution.
they
did
not
leave,
but
again,
there
was
no
question
they
were
orderly
and
not
noisy.
at
this
moment,
i
refer
back
to
what
took
place
at
the
very
opening
of
my
presentation
when
the
sheriff
now
comes
in.
he
had
meanwhile
assembled
his
deputies
but
this
was
only
a
matter
of
minutes
at
most,
perhaps
10
minutes
the
whole
incident
took
and
the
sheriff
comes
in.
the
deputies
came
in
separately.
no
one
had
--
by
the
way,
the
record
is
very
clear
as
to
the
sheriff
had
testified
that
--
that
on
record
107,
that
no
one
had
asked
the
sheriff
to
come
to
the
library
certainly
not
at
this
moment.
mrs.
perkins
said,
in
her
testimony
that
she
was
planning
to
ask
the
sheriff,
but
the
sheriff
proceeded
on
his
own
motion
and
arrived
in
about
--
about
10
minutes
after
--
so
after
the
incident
had
started.
sheriff
indicated
--
asked
to
--
apparently
ask
mrs.
perkins
whether
she'd
asked
them
to
leave.
she
indicated
she
had
asked
them
to
leave
and
they
had
not.
he
then
asked
them
to
leave.
at
this
point,
brown
said,
it
was
a
public
library
and
they
wished
a
service.
and
they
--
this
is
on
records
116
through
118
and
they
also
said,
according
to
the
sheriff's
testimony
that
they
wanted
to
check
out
books
and
wanted,
according
to
sheriff's
testimony,
at
some
point
to
integrate
the
library.
at
record
120,
the
sheriff
said
as
follows
-
i
arrested
them
because
the
occupants
of
the
building
had
asked
them
to
leave
and
so
had
i.
it
was
a
public
building
and
they
refused
to
leave.
on
next
--
the
next
question,
probably
succeeding
question
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
your
honor,
i
would
not
wish
to
draw
that
conclusion
because
they
apparently
wanted
to
use
the
library
--
use
the
library.
mr.
carl
rachlin
demonstration
i
suppose
in
a
sense
of
i
sat
on
a
library
where
i
was
not.
mr.
carl
rachlin
well
there
is
also
this
testimony
that
the
sheriff
himself
said
that
they
indicated
to
him
that
they
wanted
to
--
to
list
on
record
120,
i
think
--
one
second
--
118.
the
sheriff's
testimony
is
that
they
said
to
him
that
they
wanted
to
check
out
books
and
wanted
to
--
but
they
also
wanted
to
[inaudible]
the
library.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
think
that's
a
fair
assumption,
yes.
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
think
that's
a
fair
assumption
that
they
--
there's
a
good
chance
they
would
not
have
been
there
on
that
day
except
for
the
fact
that
this
library
--
i
think
if
i
might
add
at
this
point
that
mr.
kilbourne
can
bear
me
out
shortly
after
the
trial
in
this
case,
the
library
was
closed
and
it's
closed
as
stated.
now
that
[inaudible]
and
has
been
closed
ever
since
as
recently
as
saturday
of
this
week,
i
suppose
permanently.
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
rachlin
about
40
miles,
they're
all
part
of
that
one
--
a
three
part
type
parish
library
system.
now
this
was
--
they
were
all
part
of
the
library
who
administers
it
at
clinton
which
was
the
administrative
head
of
the
three
parish
system.
mr.
carl
rachlin
east
louisiana,
west
louisiana
and
st.
helena
parish,
i
believe
are
the
three
parish
system.
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes.
it
was
--
there
was
a
substantial
testimony
given
by
a
mrs.
spears
who
until
shortly
before
this
proceeding,
a
negro
lady,
had
been
a
librarian
there
on
the
blue
bookmobile.
her
testimony
begins
at
136
of
the
record.
and
she,
for
example,
in
the
middle
of
137,
questioned,
what
procedure
is
adopted
in
registering
a
person
for
books?
well
we
issued
a
card
to
a
person
who
filled
the
required
information
out
and
the
card
stamp
with
the
word
“negro”
and
the
date.
now
little
further
on,
do
you
ever
register
any
white
persons
to
borrow
books?
her
answer
to
that
question
was
no.
and
little
--
at
the
end
of
the
page,
have
you
ever
registered
any
white
persons?
no.
on
the
top
of
the
next
page,
why
is
it
that
you
haven't?
answer
-
on
138,
well
the
only
persons
who
use
the
blue
bookmobile
is
negroes
and
the
blue
bookmobile
serves
the
three
parishes
for
all
negroes.
and
occasionally
if
a
white
person
would
come
to
the
blue
bookmobile,
i
would
give
them
a
schedule
telling
them
when
the
red
bookmobile
would
come
or
the
nearest
branch
to
that.
that
negroes
customarily
used
the
branch
library
located
in
city
of
clinton.
in
addition,
mrs.
perkins
had
testified
that
to
the
best
of
her
knowledge
as
administrative
head
of
the
library,
every
negro
who
was
registered
in
the
library
system,
the
three
parishes
was
registered
only
in
the
blue
bookmobile.
mr.
carl
rachlin
none
at
all.
the
only
sort
the
negroes
could
use
was
the
blue
bookmobile
or
the
mails
there.
and
as
--
as
indicated
in
this
--
in
the
book
in
this
very
case,
the
one
which
was
so
mixed
up
about
the
title,
the
card
that
came
to
brown
indicated
to
return
it
either
to
the
blue
bookmobile
or
return
it
by
mail.
and
that
was
specifically
as
i
say
is
part
of
this
record.
and
now
the
--
i
think
a
significant
question
that
was
asked
on
page
--
on
the
record
121
of
the
sheriff,
so
the
disturbance
of
the
peace
if
any
in
this
case
consisted
of
refusing
to
leave
when
order
to
do
so
by
you,
is
that
right?
answer
by
sheriff
doughty,
that's
right.
they
were
convicted
as
indicated
and
the
judge
in
his
opinion,
i
think
also
makes
very
clear
in
the
middle
of
page
140
and
i
would
like
to
briefly
refer
to
that
because
i
think
it
indicates
what
we
consider
the
constitutional
violation.
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
clearly
this
is
the
judge's
all
opinion.
mr.
carl
rachlin
140,
sir,
record
140,
the
middle
of
the
page,
this
is
the
judgment
--
judge's
opinion.
clearly
the
evidence
shows
that
these
parties
did
not
congregate
when
they
came
to
the
town
of
clinton
to
the
audubon
parish
library,
merely
for
the
purpose
of
seeking
service
that
they
had
a
specific
motive
and
a
specific
intent.
and
that
was,
as
was
shown
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt,
to
refuse
to
leave
the
library
even
after
they
had
been
served
and
after
they
had
been
requested
three
times.
now
the
statute
however
in
the
--
is
somewhat
different.
and
we
--
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
look
into
the
statute
and
make
well
known
in
the
case
of
cox
against
louisiana.
the
statute
says,
whoever
with
intend
to
provoke
or
under
circumstances
such
that
a
breach
maybe
occasion,
crowds
or
congregates
with
others
in
any
public
place
or
building
and
who
fails
or
refuses
to
move
on
when
ordered
to
do
so.
the
sheriff
arrested
them
as
we've
indicated
solely
because
they
refused
to
leave
the
public
building
in
his
mind
at
least
as
his
testimony
shows
that
would
consisted
nub
of
disturbance
of
a
peace.
and
as
the
judge
indicated
nub
for
disturbance
of
the
peace,
again,
with
the
same
thing
to
refuse
to
leave
the
library
after
they
had
been
served
and
after
they
had
been
requested
to
do
so.
mr.
carl
rachlin
no,
i
--
i
will
concede
that
they
refused
to
leave
the
library.
mr.
carl
rachlin
but
not
authorized
by
the
--
even
--
well
--
i
think
your
honor,
i
have
to
say
they
were
authorized
by
the
statute
because
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
affirmed
without
opinion
the
–
the
judge's
ruling
and
therefore
that
is
the
--
the
necess
--
that
is
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
louisiana
has.
and
accordingly,
we
urge
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
for
being
as
broad
as
to
involve
an
illegal
unconstitutional
arrest
upon
people
who
committed
no
possible
afterwards
they
could
be
arrested.
mr.
carl
rachlin
frankly,
your
honor,
that
i
--
we
think
that
the
library
is
a
public
building
and
the
people
have
a
right
to
be
in
a
public
building
providing
they
are
orderly
and
providing
that
they
are
not
breaking
any
of
the
reasonable
rules.
we
certainly
would
recognize
that
the
position
that
this
court
has
taken
in
edwards
and
some
of
the
other
cases
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
set
reasonable
limitations
and
reasonable
regulations
for
the
use
of
public
property.
and
--
but
that,
they
would
in
no
way
were
they
violating
any
regulation
or
rule
that
isn't
--
was
known
to
any
of
the
parties
of
the
record
of
this
case.
they
were
there
in
the
proper
time
of
the
library.
they
behaved
quietly.
the
only
question
was
whether
the
sheriff
had
the
right
under
those
circumstances
to
order
them
to
leave
and
arrest
–
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
is
a
product
in
question.
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
would
say
your
honor
that
would
depend
upon
the
circumstances.
there
is
certainly
--
there
was
no
such
rule
prior
to
the
–
their
opinion.
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes.
there's
no
question
about
that
that
the
person
on
the
place
have
some
duties.
mr.
carl
rachlin
if
the
sheriff
had
to
use
force
first
and
they
had
resisted
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
well
i
would
say
that
they
were
not
substantially
different
situation
even
though
there
are
a
lot
of
facts
in
this
case
unfortunately.
mr.
carl
rachlin
let's
say
a
harder
situation
but
i
think
the
sheriff
has
the
right
to
use
force
illegally
then
i
have
the
right
to
use
force
illegally.
mr.
carl
rachlin
and
so
long
as
the
library
is
open.
i
mean,
i
will
--
i'm
not
raising
the
question
whether
i
have
the
right
to
stay
after
hours.
mr.
carl
rachlin
that's
right.
mr.
carl
rachlin
that's
right
and
--
and
if
the
statute
is
so
interpret
as
to
make
this
an
illegal
act
and
we
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
it's
the
same
statute
your
honor.
they
are
the
statutes
of
very
long
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
well
the
cox
part
of
the
statute
related
to
activities
out
in
the
open
air.
mr.
carl
rachlin
this
is
--
this
is
the
same
--
the
same
paragraph
in
the
book
but
it
hasn't.
it
includes
outside-inside
public-private,
all
in
subdivision
one
of
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
would
say
that
louisiana
would
be
bound
by
the
interpretation
of
this
decision
of--
of
the
court
--
of
this
court
in
cox
and
i
think
there
probably
is
something
left
of
the
statute
if
interpreted
probably
for
example
in
--
in
the
case
that
is
so
often
cited
by
many
of
the
courts,
particularly
in
southern
courts
but
northern
as
well
as
in
new
york,
we,
in
new
york
has
called
people
against
galert
which
--
which
cited
the
proposition
that
you
have
an
automatic
obligation
to
obey
an
order
of
a
police
officer
no
matter
how
--
no
matter
--
under
what
circumstances
made.
well,
in
the
case
really,
it
does
not
stand
on
this
proposition.
all
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
lay
that
proposition
to
rest
particularly
in
light
of
its
decision
in
shuttlesworth
which
is
not
identical
with
this
case.
it
has
many
overlapping
observations.
for
example
in
galbert
the
opening
indication
was
that
there
was
an
actual
obstruction
of
the
street
unhappy
that
there
had
been
many
people
congregating
on
the
street.
in
other
words,
the
presupposition
of
facts
in
galprin
was
that
the
speed
was
obstructed
and
the
police
officer
therefore
asked
everybody
to
move
on.
and
in
fact
judge
lehman
there
made
it
very
clear
when
he
said
the
police
officers
are
not
the
final
arbiters
of
the
rights
of
citizens.
so
that
for
reasons
that
we
have
set
forth
specifically
in
our
brief,
we
urge
that
this
is
--
the
connection
must
be
reversed
that
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
by
louisiana
is
an
unconstitutional
interpretation,
it
is
hopefully
broad.
it
does
advice
citizens
of
how
to
perform
under
this
act
any
event
the
act
was
--
as
judge
harlan
was
suggesting
was
perhaps
that
the
first
amendment
right
that
we
think
ought
to
be
protected.
and
lastly
our
argument
--
next,
our
argument
is
that
the
--
that
the
--
there
was
a
--
we
think
there
is
any
statement
here
under
the
title
3
of
the
civil
rights
act
because
the
title
iii
was
passed
several
months
--
and
that
the
act
was
passed
several
months
after
the
arrest
here
and
title
iii
made
it
very
clear
that
these
--
that
such
--
we
think
that
such
kind
of
this
was
legal
conduct.
and
therefore
any
statute
which
made
it
illegal
was
improper.
mr.
carl
rachlin
well
your
honor,
i
think
that
in
a
sense
and
if
it's
known,
this
is
a
common
not
library.
people
will
have
to
--
i
don't
think
the
person
has
an
obligation
to
explain
his
presence
in
a
public
place
and
i
would
hope
that
--
that
this
court
would
recognize
that
there
were
times
and
occasions
where
you
don't
have
to
tell
why
you're
at
some
place.
you
may
have
a
right
to
stay
there
providing
your
behaving
in
an
orderly
and
proper
manner.
the
record
is
clear
that
these
people
are
behaving
in
a
properly
orderly
manner.
and
to
me,
at
least
if
you
permit
me,
sir,
it
is
highly
irrelevant
whether
they
were
or
they
would
not
served.
they
were
in
publicly
owned
building
doing
nothing
to
disturb
anybody.
the
only
reason
they
were
rejected
is
because
they
were
the
first
negroes
to
enter
that
building
and
the
record
is
clear
on
that
and
the
sheriff
himself
said
he
hadn't
seen
any
negroes
in
there
before.
mr.
carl
rachlin
his
office
is
just
down
the
block
and
he
said
he
saw.
that's
true.
maybe
it's
a
--
i
trust
it's
not
a
perfect
commentary
on
life
in
clinton
and
i'm
sure
mr.
kilbourne
could
indicate
that
there
are
many
more
people
who
use
the
library
more
often
than
twice.
i
would
think
that
to
me,
sir,
the
nub
of
the
case
is
the
right
not
to
have
to
explain
yourself
when
you're
behaving
yourself
properly
in
a
public
place.
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
would
be
prepared
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
no,
i
mis
--
i
misunderstood
it.
mr.
carl
rachlin
no,
the
record
does
not
sustain
that
completely.
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes,
i
would
--
we
are
only
bound
--
this
court
is
only
bound
by
the
record.
mr.
carl
rachlin
now
that
is
--
but
i
would
say
even
if
that
were
the
fact
as
the
judge
so
states
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes
sir.
mr.
carl
rachlin
no,
i
didn't
say
that.
i
said
there
might
--
for
example
the
state
had
had
a
reasonable
regulation
well
known
to
people
in
advance,
they
might
be
able
to
do
that.
mr.
carl
rachlin
that's
the
--
that's
part
of
our
argument,
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
would
say,
if
there
was
a
regulation
known
and
it
said,
people
--
only
people
actually
using
library
can
remain
beyond
x
minutes
or
whatever
the
time
is,
such
a
regulation
would
not
be
unreasonable
providing
with
--
it
was
enforced
in
an
equal
manner
because
you
--
yes.
mr.
carl
rachlin
well
providing
that
the
government
imposed
a
custo
--
a
custodial
authority
which
in
itself
was
not
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
that
is
--
if
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
say
a
law
to
that
effect
would
be
necessarily
unconstitutional.
mr.
carl
rachlin
that
is
right,
yes
sir.
subject
to
any
comments,
i
might
make
to
how
the
law
was
enforced
in
any
given
moment
but
the
law
itself,
i
do
not
--
reasonable
regulation.
mr.
carl
rachlin
that's
a
different
thing,
yes,
sir.
