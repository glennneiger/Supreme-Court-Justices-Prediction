but
this
--
this
was
a
book
by
another
name,
by
another
author.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wasn't
the
--
wasn't
the
author
that
was
given
the
library.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
--
didn't
the
communication
sending
it
out
say
that
this
is
not
the
book
you
asked
for
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
by
another
author
but
it's
perhaps
what
you
want.
justice
byron

112?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
assume
the
--
assume
the
sheriff
asked
them
to
leave
and
they
said
no
and
then
he
attempted
to
eject
them
by
force
and
they
resisted
by
force.
would
this
make
any
difference
to
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
no,
they
--
he
asked
them
and
they
say
“no,
we're
going
to
stay.”
and
this
is,
“well,
i'll
have
to
remove
you.”
so
he
uses
force
to
remove
them
and
they
resisted
by
force.
is
this
a
different
situation
for
you
or
would
you
just
say,
well
they
had
the
right
to
be
there
and
whether
they
--
they
could
stay
there
if
they
wanted
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
--
that's
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
--
so
you
really
do
rely
on
the
fact
they
have
the
right
to
stay
in
the
public
building
in
the
library
and
just
remain
there
as
long
as
they're
peaceful.
