justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rachlin,
excuse
me,
doesn't
the
state
say
that
there
was
no
such
book
in
existence?
justice
abe
fortas
well
mr.
rachlin,
do
you
dispute
a
finding
or
a
statement
of
the
court
on
page
140,
the
one
that
you
just
read.
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
point
is
that
that
statement
is
an
indication
that
the
arrest
and
conviction
here
were
not
authorized
by
the
statute.
justice
abe
fortas
does
it
make
any
difference
in
your
theory
of
this
case
whether
mr.
brown
and
his
companions
entered
the
library
and
asked
for
a
book
on
the
one
hand
or
whether
on
the
other
hand,
they
just
stand
on
the
library
and
sat
there.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
kilbourne,
as
i
read
your
brief
and
as
i
listen
to
you
here,
i
--
a
question
occurs
to
me
is
the
state
of
louisiana
telling
us
that
in
this
parish
library
facilities
are
not
segregated.
that
is
to
say
that
a
negro
can
get
service
from
any
library
facility,
any
public
library
facility
in
this
parish.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
representation
of
the
state
of
louisiana?
justice
abe
fortas
now
these
cards
--
this
library
of
cards.
as
i
remember
the
record,
there
is
a
testimony
to
the
effect
that
the
library
current
issued
to
a
negro
is
stamped
negro.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
dispute
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
does
that
practice
continue?
justice
abe
fortas
well
the
record
says
quite
the
contrary,
doesn't
it?
is
there
any
testimony
in
the
record
to
support
what
you
have
just
said?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
testimony
of
the
record
with
the
precise
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
you're
experiencing
now.
justice
abe
fortas
i
say
it's
happening
now
and
i
want
to
ask
you
about
the
last
statement
that
you
made.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
a
negro
who
wants
to
get
a
book
from
the
red
bookmobile
can't
do
something?
there
is
a
testimony
of
some
woman
that
used
to
work
with
the
library
i've
forgotten
her
name,
to
the
precise
officer.
justice
abe
fortas
now
what
about
this
testimony
of
your
witness
that
you
call,
miriam
fienberg
â€“
finegold.
you
called
her
on
page
69
of
the
record,
unless
i
missed
something
in
here
she
is
still
on
the
stand
on
page
86
and
87
and
you're
asking
a
lot
of
questions
about
the
court.
you
asked
her
on
page
87,
you
know
if
some
colored
person
who's
been
accused
service
at
the
library.
the
answer,
i
know
five
such
persons
and
then
it
says
that
if
she
means
defendants
and
so
on.
and
that
make
it
appear
to
me
that
you
have
some
awareness,
mr.
kilbourne
that
the
trial
with
racial
issues
is
not
far.
