mr.
rachlin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
have
any
--
any
library
--
branch
libraries
specifically
for
negroes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rachlin,
i
didn't
quite
understand
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
fortas
about
this
finding
on
--
on
page
140.
i
--
i
--
i
thought
you
said
that
you
did
not
contest
that
finding.
do
you
--
do
you
agree
that
the
evidence
shows
that
--
and
i
quote
“that
they
had
a
specific
motive
and
a
specific
intent”
and
that
was
as
shown
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
to
refuse
to
leave
the
library
even
after
they
had
been
served
and
after
they
had
been
requested
three
times.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
not
asking
what
you'd
be
prepared
for.
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
does
the
record
sustain
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
isn't
that
what
we're
bound
by,
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
think
you
have
been
over
at
that,
the
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kilbourne.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
--
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
it
is
a
common
practice
in
that
library
for
the
librarian
to
--
the
person
asked
for
a
book
and
the
book
is
not
there
to
ask
them
to
leave
immediately?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
happened
here,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there
were
several
rooms
there
that
were
used
for
the
library.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
employees
were
there
in
the
--
in
these
other
rooms?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
record
show
[inaudible]
aspects
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
we
--
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
asked
the
counsel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
prior
to
this
--
prior
to
this
incident,
had
negroes
ever
gone
into
that
library?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
they
have
gone
in
there
for
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
gone
in
there
for
a
service
to
the
library
as
a
white
person
went?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
will
you
explain
to
us
why
that
would
be
if
you
didn't
have
segregation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
white
women.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
then
these
--
in
these
branches
and
white
women
wouldn't
work.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
couldn't
get
any
white
women
to
work
in
there
if
they
allowed
negroes
to
--
to
use
the
library,
is
that
the
fact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
record
about
the
availability
of
this
service
other
than
this
testimony
that
--
that
justice
douglas
read
it
on
the
page
136
and
137,
mrs.
spears
that
you
had
this
double
system,
one
for
negroes
and
one
for
--
one
for
whites.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
objected?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
kilbourne,
i
--
i
--
i
thought
that
it
was
tried
on
the
basis
of
being
a
racial
case
because
the
--
the
sheriff
testified
the
reason
he
put
them
under
arrest
was
that
these
people
had
come
there
for
a
different
purpose.
and
that
was
to
establish
racial
equality
in
your
--
and
your
court
in
this
finding
on
140
--
page
140
says
clearly
the
evidence
shows
that
these
parties
did
not
congregate
when
they
came
to
the
town
of
clinton,
to
the
audubon
parish
library
merely
for
the
purpose
of
seeking
service
and
that
they
had
a
specific
motive
and
a
specific
intent,
and
that
was
as
were
shown
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
to
refuse
to
leave
the
library
even
after
they
had
--
had
been
served
and
after
they'd
been
requested
to
leave.
now
doesn't
that
--
doesn't
that
make
the
case
turn
on
a
racial
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
these
people
--
these
people
and
the
--
in
one
of
the
three
parishes
that
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
this
library
served.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
kilbourne.
