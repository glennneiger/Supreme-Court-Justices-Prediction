it
--
to

an
ingredient
of
an

well
she
said,

only
person
who
will
use
the
blue
bookmobile
is
negroes
and
the
blue
bookmobile
serves
the
three
parishes
for
all
negroes
and
occasionally
if
a
white
person

the
blue
bookmobile,
i've
give
him
the
schedule
when
the
red
bookmobile
would
come.

like
a
segregated
library
system.
