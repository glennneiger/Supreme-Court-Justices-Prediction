justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
$150
or
90
or
$150
and
90?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
thought
you
have
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
evidence
of
the
policy
directly
against
the
policy
of
the
library?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
question
about
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
see
if
i
understand
your
position
clearly.
as
i
understand
you,
you
take
the
position,
the
library
or
the
public
place,
people
can
go
in
and
sit
down,
stay
there,
who
want
no
service,
who
do
not
wish
to
read
but
who
simply
wish
to
sit
there
and
that
the
state
is
constitutionally
without
power,
you
say
they
can't
do
that,
that's
what
i
understand
to
be
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
then
you're
--
then
you're
not
going
on
that
basis.
you're
going
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
regulation,
no
law
which
authorized
the
custodian
to
do
what
she
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
was
a
law
which
authorized
you
had
to
do
what
she
did.
these
people
came
in
there
not
to
get
a
book
or
came
to
get
a
book
and
found
they
couldn't
get
it
and
they
decided
they
were
just
going
to
stay
there.
what
is
your
position
as
to
what
authority
it
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
you
are
not
arguing
that
a
person
can
go
into
a
public
building,
because
it
is
a
public
building
and
defy
the
custodian
of
that
building
and
stay
there
against
the
desire
of
the
custodian
which
desires
responsive
to
a
trust
which
has
been
impost
in
the
custodian
by
the
--
by
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
it
would
violate
the
constitution
for
instance
for
the
congress
as
the
law
to
the
effect,
people
couldn't
come
in
and
sit
down
on
the
outside
here
in
the
lobby
that
is
beyond
here,
stay
there,
when
the
custodian
comes
and
tells
them
that
unless
they
have
presented
through
the
motion
to
get
out.
do
you
see
a
law
that
could
be
beyond
constitutional
to
that
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
would
--
it
would
be
on
imperative
so
far
as
the
responsibility
of
the
library
and
say,
would
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
of
course,
if
it
was
discriminatory.
well
that's
a
different
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mwhat
kind
of
library?
i
haven't
fully
understood
from
the
statements
up
to
date,
what
is
that
library?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
a
reading
library?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
she
the
only
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
she
the
only
one
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
have
any
other
rooms
where
they
have
places
for
people
to
read?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
this
library
ever
been
to
serve
colored
person
at
anytime
during
its
past
history?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
evidence
in
this
record,
did
they
offer
any
evidence
or
is
there
any
evidence
that
there
has
ever
been
any
person
refused
service
in
this
library
who
has
the
books,
any
question,
white
or
black?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
--
suppose
they
had
declined
service
then
what
would
your
position
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
account
of
the
fact
that
you
raise?
