now
where
does
it
appeal
when
the
book
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
it
a
fair
assumption
that
they
would
not
have
been
there
that
morning?
had
they
not
have
been
viewed
that
the
library
is
not
open?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
does
your
argument,
mr.
rachlin,
that
whatever
maybe
the
regulation,
that
this
statute
should
only
read
to
non-peaceful
conduct--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
on
this
sum
total
of
facts,
even
though
they
didn't
go
when
they
were
asked
to
leave,
and
even
if
that
were
legitimate
regulation
that
they're
not
convicted,
at
least
those
proofs
don't'
add
up
to
a
violation
of
this
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
was
the
statute
we
had
in
cox,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
left
to
that
statute
after
our
decision
in
cox?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
--
this
is
part
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
argue
that
that
there's
nothing
left
to
the
statute
after
our
decision
of
the
cox,
is
that
it?
