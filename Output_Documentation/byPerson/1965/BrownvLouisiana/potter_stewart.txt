mrs.
reeves
was
alone
in
the
room
when
he's
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
and
these
there
were
five
of
these
people
who
entered
the
room.
justice
potter
stewart
was
she
behind
the
desk
of
some
kind
or
--?
justice
potter
stewart
before
--
i
want
to
get
one
thing
clear.
she
asked
them
to
leave
before
calling
her
superior.
justice
potter
stewart
well
is
it
correct
or
not
that
she
did
not
ask
them
to
leave
until
after
she
had
taken
the
order
herself
trying
to
find
the
book
there,
failed
to
find
it,
and
then
told
them
that
she
would
send
the
book
and
let
him
know.
justice
potter
stewart
so
there
was
no
--
maybe
i'm
--
am
i
fairly
stating
the
factual
conclusion
when
i
say
there
was
no
refusal
of
service
by
her
to
these
people.
justice
potter
stewart
or
of
any
other
requested
service?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
of
hand
can
you
tell
us
where
in
the
record
this
testimony
about
the
constitution
appearance?
justice
potter
stewart
don't
take
the
time,
we
will
find
it
on
our
own.
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
testimony
begins
apparently
in
page
116.
i'm
looking
at
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
you
think
what?
justice
potter
stewart
the
opinion
of
this
testimony
on
page
118
of
these
people,
the
petitioners
were
from
east
louisiana
and
west
louisiana.
justice
potter
stewart
how
far
away
is
that
from
this
library?
justice
potter
stewart
but
east
and
west
louisiana
were
included
in
the
library
despite
of
the
law.
justice
potter
stewart
this
question
--
isn't
the
first
question
whether
the
lady
in
charge
terms;
has
the
right
to
ask
them
to
leave.
justice
potter
stewart
and
wouldn't
that
--
this
argue
be
perfectly
reasonable
regulation
and
the
person
in
charge
of
the
library
decide
when
it
was
getting
too
crowded
and
after
people
had
been
served
to
ask
them
to
leave?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
know,
you
don't
know.
and
i
don't
know
either
whether
there
was
any
such
rule
but
generally,
a
person
in
charge
of
a
public
place
has
some
duties.
justice
potter
stewart
the
difficulty
with
that
argument
and
it
was
much
of
what
you
said
this
morning
for
me
is
that
this
--
there
was
no
refusal
of
service
to
these
people.
they
were
served
and
i've
just
look
through
the
record
again.
as
far
as
i
find
every
request
that
they
made
was
responded
to
with
courtesy
and
with
service.
that
--
that
is
the
ultimate
basic
crucial
fact
that
for
me
makes
much
of
your
argument
irrelevant.
i
mean
because
it's
--
it's
--
this
is
unlikely
of
these
other
cases
that
you've
been
citing
to
me.
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
said
he'd
only
been
to
the
library
twice
and
it's
all
a
lot.
justice
potter
stewart
well
they
had
to
keep
the
books
somewhere.
it
was
a
library.
justice
potter
stewart
where
were
they
kept?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
main
room
or
back
in
these
other
rooms.
justice
potter
stewart
at
page
117.
justice
potter
stewart
which
witness
are
you
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
