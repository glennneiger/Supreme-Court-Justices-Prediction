mr.
richard
f.
generelly
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
at
this
moment
right
at
the
outset
to
answer
a
question
near
and
dear
to
my
heart
which
i
believe
mr.
justice
clark
asked
of
mr.
varner
some
time
back.
that
was
whether
the
producer
or
any
of
these
producers
here
had
filed
for
their
23.55
or
for
some
higher
price
following
certification.
and
wouldn't
we
be
able
to
protect
ourselves
on
that
basis
in
the
unique
circumstance
of
this
case
your
honor.
we
could
not
protect
ourselves.
let
us
assume
that
the
commission
had
done
the
right
thing
to
begin
with
and
we
have
been
certificated
we'll
say
at
20
cents.
we
could
then
have
filed
up
to
23.55
cents
and
have
been
collecting
that
for
the
past,
however,
many
years
it's
been
subject
to
refund.
now,
petitioners
take
the
position
that
because
we
did
not
have
a
permanent
certificate,
we
are
entitled
only
to
an
in-line
price
and
we're
not
entitled
to
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
and
certainly,
most
of
all,
we're
not
entitled
to
any
determination
of
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
the
price
we've
been
collecting
for
the
last
eight
or
nine
years.
now,
the
practical
effect
of
requiring
refunds
as
the
commission
would
where
the
measure
is
the
in-line
price
rather
than
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
would
be
almost
absurd.
it
would
be
almost
too
horrible
to
think
about
from
some
of
these
producers
point
of
view.
we
would
have
to
refund
immediately,
moneys
collected
back
to
january
1,
1962
in
the
case
of
my
client
callery
of
1959
i'm
sorry,
refunded.
and
then
we're
told
to
file
for
23.55
and
began
to
collect
all
over
again
subject
to
refund.
suppose
your
honors
that
down
the
line
at
the
conclusion
of
the
southern
louisiana
area
rate
proceeding,
it
is
determined
that
the
price
is
a
penny
or
a
half
cent
higher
than
18.5
cents.
how
is
the
commission
at
that
point
ever
or
going
to
make
callery
whole
or
how
can
callery
be
ever
made
whole?
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
we've
been
collecting
it
all
along.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
no,
we
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
we've
been
operating
under
a
stay
granted
initially
by
the
commission
and
then
granted
by
the
fifth
circuit.
so
none
of
these
producers
at
this
juncture
has
reduced
its
price
or
has
filed
for
any
increase.
i
take
that
fact,
one
of
the
producers
has.
we
had
a
stay
of
the
moratorium
condition
also.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
my
client
is
still
collecting
23.55
but
one
of
the
other
respondents
here
has
been
collecting
since,
i
believe
it
is
december
of
1962,
a
price
of
25.55
cents.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
and
if
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
that's
right
or
whatever
the
difference
between
25.55
and
whatever
is
determined
to
be
the
just
and
reasonable
rate,
not
20
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
well,
we've
been
litigating
a
good
bid
of
it
your
honor.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
indeed
we
could.
now
i've
--
by
attempting
to
answer
your
question
which
was
put
to
mr.
varner,
i've
gotten
completely
off
the
track
of
my
argument
and
i
would
like
if
i
might
to
return
because
i'm
going
to
get
back
to
this,
i
assure
you.
this
is
the
near
and
dear
things
to
the
heart
of
my
client.
but
i
would
like
to
address
myself
very
briefly
to
the
moratorium
issue.
in
hunt
last
term,
in
your
opinion
justice
clark,
you
held
that
it
was
at
the
point,
a
permanent
certification
or
unconditional
temporary
certification
that
section
4
came
into
play
on
the
scheme
of
the
act.
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
producer
might
go
forward
and
avail
himself
of
the
rights
reserved
to
natural
gas
companies
under
the
act
to
seek
contractually
authorized
increases.
now
to
be
sure,
the
question
of
the
commission's
authority
to
condition
a
grant
of
permanent
certification
upon
such
a
condition
to
impose
such
a
moratorium
was
not
touched,
was
not
before
the
court.
we
believe
the
court
below
was
perfectly
correct
in
holding
that
the
moratorium
imposed
in
this
case
as
a
condition
of
permanent
authorization
aggravated
perhaps
by
the
facts
that
we've
given
our
right
to
reject
it.
we
never
have
that
on
this
thing.
but
if
that
exceeded
the
commission
statutory
authority,
all
we
have
is
tantamount
to
write
in
section
4
out
of
the
act.
now,
his
reasoning
and
most
persuasive
to
me
and
about
the
only
thing
that
i
can
come
up
with
is
the
rather
extreme
example
i
realized.
but
if
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
impose
a
moratorium
for
whatever
duration,
as
a
condition
of
permanent
certification,
what
are
we
doing
here?
the
commission
might
as
well
declare
a
permanent
moratorium,
the
time
of
permanent
certification
on
a
finding
made
under
section
7
of
the
natural
gas
act
that
the
present
and
future
public
convenience
necessity
requires
that
this
particular
gas
reserve
are
all
gas
reserves
to
be
sold
at
the
same
price
and
one
price
only
for
the
20-year
period.
and
then
to
provide
under
section
5
in
an
area
rate
proceeding
we
will
give
relief
to
the
entire
producing
industry
on
a
group
basis
rather
than
any
individual.
i
don't
think
that
congress
ever
intended
that
a
--
an
agency
should
have
such
unfettered
power.
they
might
as
well
write
19
out
of
the
act
you
know
on
the
theory
that
their
hard
work,
general
counsel
staff
has
got
to
have
a
little
respite
of
a
couple
of
years
with
no
lawsuits.
if
they're
going
to
write
section
4
out,
why
not
19,
why
not
any
other
section?
now
that
may
sound
fictitious
but
a
little
absurd
but
as
a
practical
matter
at
some
point,
you
become
a
natural
gas
company
and
entitled
to
all
the
rights.
you
start
with
all
the
obligations
and
duties
but
at
some
point
the
right
is
attached.
now,
the
extent
of
the
commission's
power
to
condition
permanent
certification,
in
this
case,
we
not
only
do
we
think
it's
another
step
for
the
scheme
of
the
act
but
there
is
no
practical
reason
for
it
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
my
view
and
the
view
of
my
client,
there's
a
very
good
reason.
why?
we've
got
to
preserve
this
right
of
the
producer
to
at
least
seek,
collect
subject
to
refund
his
contractually
authorized
price
until
it
is
determined
what
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
is.
now,
the
real
problem
is
that
i
come
right
down
to
it.
the
producer
apparently,
is
never
going
to
be
able
to
justify
his
individual
price
because
we're
now
going
in
the
area
of
pricing
and
at
the
risk
of
giving
a
sneak
preview
of
something
that
is
not
before
the
court,
i
appreciate
that
but
it's
important
to
demonstrate
why
at
least
we
must
preserve
some
status
quo
here.
in
my
view,
there's
a
very
serious
question
as
to
the
validity
of
the
area
approach
as
it
is
now
been
applied
in
the
permian
basin
decision,
opinion
468.
that
will
be
the
prototype
for
the
southern
louisiana
proceeding
certainly.
they
both
use
the
same
test
here,
1960.
now,
in
a
nutshell,
what
the
commission
has
done
is
to
start
with
an
acceptance
of
the
thesis
of
directionality.
this
means
in
short
that
the
producing
industry
today
as
a
result
of
advancements
in
technology
and
experience
gained
over
these
many
years
can
direct
its
search
for
--
you
have
oil
or
gas.
and
bear
in
mind,
this
doesn't
mean
it's
going
to
find
it
but
if
it
find
something,
it's
more
likely
to
be
oil
and
more
likely
to
be
gas.
people
know
where
to
look
today.
now,
this
isn't
restricted
entirely
to
the
majors.
some
of
us
small
producers
can
do
it
too.
the
records
are
simply
there.
alright
now,
in
order
to
provide
the
incentive
to
the
producer
to
go
out
and
find
gas,
we
have
a
two-price
system
cost
based,
the
base
is
being
the
cost
of
finding
new
non-associative
so-called
gas-well
gas.
now
that
should
be
a
premium
fuel,
if
you
will.
the
producing
industry
should
be
encouraged
to
go
out
and
find
it.
therefore,
we
will
cut
your
old
price
and
raise
this
new
price
for
which
you
find
in
the
future.
the
only
problem
for
the
small
producer
is
that
what
is
he
--
the
where
--
whether
they
find
this
new
thing
is
dependent
on
his
past
revenues
and
income.
but
beside
that
in
terms
of
doubtful
validity,
in
the
permian
case,
unfortunately,
the
commission
admittedly
made
no
effort
to
determine
whether
the
industry
will
recover,
the
industry
determined
cost
at
the
price
fixed.
they
don't
know
what
the
impact
of
this
thing
is
going
to
be.
by
their
own
admission
at
least
half
of
the
producers
will
not
earn
the
rate
of
return
which
the
commission
is
determined
to
be
just
and
reasonable
for
the
industry
as
a
whole.
this
is
a
problem
you
run
into
in
any
--
anytime
you
go
into
averages.
they
fix
the
price
of
new
gas-well
gas
based
on
the
cost
associated
with
20%
for
the
production
in
the
whole
permian
basin.
they
ignore
the
rest.
its
too
fragmentary,
can't
get
a
hold
of
it.
now,
they
have
a
savings
clause,
you
will
recall
that
in
the
second
philip's
case,
there
was
an
argument
--
in
the
course
of
the
argument.
the
commission
indicated,
mr.
solomon
indicated
that
in
all
probability,
the
commission
would
have
to
make
some
provision
for
the
individual
who
just
couldn't
live
under
this
savings
clause.
the
savings
clause
has
emerged.
it
is
at
least
from
my
standpoint
and
i
know
many
others,
bankruptcy
standard.
the
only
way
that
you
can
get
on
variation
apparently
will
be
to
show
that
you're
not
recovering
out
of
pocket
operating
expenses.
forget
any
return,
forget
any
profit
in
effect
you're
bankrupted.
at
which
case,
the
commission
says,
"i'll
be
--
maybe
entitled
some
relief
from
refunds
or
permitted
to
abandon
yourself
because
if
you're
not
tough
shape,
you
probably
don't
have
much
gas
to
sell
anyhow".
well
if
the
small
producer
who
finds
himself
in
that
position
is
indeed
socially
or
economically
undesirable,
so
be
it.
however,
the
important
thing
for
the
court
i
think
to
keep
in
mind
is
when
we
look
at
the
question
of
the
refund
and
the
standard
utilized
by
the
court
below,
that
is
of
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
that
even
the
commission
under
an
area
approach
where
we
fix
it
on
averages
and
don't
look
at
the
individual
does
recognize
it
in
the
matter
of
refund,
it
runs
perhaps
smacked
dead
into
the
constitutional
issue
of
confiscation
unless
it
does
look
at
the
individual.
so
it
has
a
savings
clause.
i
assure
you
gentlemen,
the
savings
clause
will
be
tested
by
somebody
if
he
hasn't,
he
might
pay
his
lawyer.
but
we
do
have
several
serious
questions.
now
in
the
interim
--
oh,
i
forgot
to
mention
the
most
important
thing.
i'm
talking
about
moratorium.
the
commission
has
now
enclosed
another
moratorium.
having
now
determined
the
just
and
reasonable
area
rate,
it
says,
there
shall
be
no
rate
increases
above
the
ceiling
prices
fixed
for
a
period
of
about
two
and
a
half
years.
this
sole
statutory
basis
--
there's
no
statutory
basis
for
this.
the
sole
basis
is
that
otherwise
we'd
have
to
start
another
area
case.
now
bearing
in
mind
that
the
whole
determination
in
that
case
and
in
the
southern
louisiana
case
which
is
our
case
will
be
on
the
basis
of
1960
data.
that
opinion
will
not
come
to
your
honors
for
another
two
years
probably
and
then
we've
got
until
1968
before
we
can
even
begin
to
file
for
and
collect
subject
to
refund.
how
in
the
world
is
the
commission
ever
going
to
come
out
with
a
decision
that
isn't
so
stale,
and
ancient
and
hoary
by
the
time
we
get
it
but
its
not
indicative
of
the
current
need
of
the
industry.
now
our
position
on
this
in-line
question
is
that
the
one
place
where
the
commission
does
have
an
opportunity
to
respond
and
react
is
when
the
new
proposal
comes
before
it.
at
that
time,
it
can
evaluate
if
the
price
appears
to
be
out
of
line.
it
can
give
the
producer
an
opportunity
to
show.
perhaps
if
this
line
has
moved
and
we
don't
have
to
wait
for
an
area
proceeding.
but
as
of
today,
there
are
some
types
of
evidence
the
commission
could
prescribe
as
being
relevant
to
show
them.
we
don't
attack
catco.
we
don't
attack
in-line.
we
simply
say
that
we
--
in
this
case,
without
knowing
what
to
show,
try
to
show
too
much
perhaps
but
if
it's
more
relevant
to
a
rate
case,
and
mr.
varner
is
correct,
we
can't
put
in
a
rate
case.
they
won't
look
at
this
individually
just
in
groups
and
numbers.
where
are
we
going
to
put
them?
where
are
we
going
to
have
our
day?
is
it
when
we
get
to
the
savings
clause?
or
just
two
points,
if
one
of
them
is
in
that
connection.
within
the
last
ten
days,
the
staff
in
the
southern
louisiana
proceeding
which
supposedly
will
be
determined
of
a
large
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
the
future
as
applying
the
permian
basin
costing
principles
come
up
with
the
finding
that
callery's
cost,
production
cost,
exploration
and
development
cost
with
the
12%
rate
of
return,
no
taxes
or
anything
in
1960
was
21.96
cents.
the
in-line
price
they've
prescribed
is
18.5
cents.
we're
collecting
23.55.
they
would
have
as
immediately
refund
the
difference
between
23.55
and
18.5
and
let's
assume
that
price
turns
out
to
be
21
cents.
how
can
they
ever
get
the
difference
between
18.5
and
the
21?
we
can't.
the
commission
is
the
first
to
tell
you
and
they're
quite
correct.
they
have
no
reparations
power,
no
power
to
go
back
and
to
hope
unless
we
are
permitted
to
retain
this
subject
to
refund.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
more
refund
than
the
producer
of
a
consumer
we'd
get
otherwise,
because
of
the
--
he's
going
to
get
five
or
six
months
more
refund.
the
suspension
period
they
speak
of,
unless
we
do
where
--
we're
in
an
impossible
situation
out
of
--
to
relate
this
refund
problem
and
the
moratorium
problem
to
callery.
my
client,
callery
is
a
small
independent.
not
too
small.
in
1963,
in
the
commission's
published
statistics
of
sales
by
independent
producers,
there
were
shown
260
producers
selling
over
two
billion
cubic
feet
of
gas
a
year
in
interstate
commerce.
callery's
at
number
140
out
of
260.
that
was
in
1960.
callery
is
dependent
for
all
of
its
income
which
goes
into
exploring
or
in
finding
gas
on
the
investment
from
individuals,
more
than
300
of
them
who
come
in
and
put
their
money
and
they're
carefully
screened
because
they
can
lose
it
all.
they
can
afford
to
lose
it
perhaps.
they
come
in,
they
participate.
callery
has
to
provide
the
expertise.
the
well
production
is
found,
they
all
own
a
percentage.
now
these
investors
partly
because
of
the
depressing
state
of
the
domestic
oil
at
the
present
time
and
also
because
of
the
very
existence
of
federal
power
commission
regulation
and
the
difficulties
we
have
with
it,
such
things
as
a
refund
without
warning.
these
investors
have
become
less
and
less
enchanted
with
the
prospect
of
putting
their
money
into
this
and
they
want
to
go
elsewhere.
as
a
result,
callery
in
the
last
two
years,
their
e&d,
exploration
and
development,
their
looking
program
has
gone
way
down
and
will
continue
to
go
down
probably
until
some
stability
comes
here
or
until
at
least
there's
a
recognition
that
as
a
public
utility
if
you
will
or
a
natural
gas
company
under
the
act
much
as
a
pipeline,
we
are
entitled
to
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
that
doesn't
have
to
be
determined
at
the
time.
we
go
in
to
business,
we
realize
that.
but
at
some
point,
they've
got
to
look
at
us
individually,
otherwise
like
justice
clark
predicted,
maybe
the
consumer
will
be
the
biggest
use
of
this
wild
goose
chase
but
a
small
producer
is
going
to
be
the
dead
duck.
just
two
other
matters
your
honors,
if
i
may,
first,
callery
also
raised
the
question
of
justness
and
reasonableness
and
the
failure
to
make
such
a
determination
before
ordering
refunds.
it
raised
that
before
the
commission
and
its
application
for
rehearing
and
it
was
argued
in
the
court
below.
on
the
question
of
refunds
and
the
court's
legitimate
concern
and
that
of
the
commission
that
you
can't
deter
these
things
rather,
that
is
at
best
a
poor
remedy.
certainly,
just
and
reasonable
rates
are
a
better
remedy.
i
would
point
out
your
honor
that
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
in
this
case,
indicating
and
which
should
have
indicated
that
there
was
serious
question
as
to
just
what
the
amount
of
any
increase
that
has
occurred
over
these
years
was
and
whether
it
has
in
fact
been
passed
on
to
the
consumer.
now,
just
as
past
week,
well,
not
quite,
october
4th,
the
commission
has
suddenly
waken
up
to
the
fact
that
it
was
--
should've
been
aware
of
some
time
that
texas
eastern
transmission
corporation
is
asserting
the
right
to
retain
$8
million
of
refund
from
producers.
texas
eastern
says,
“we
never
passed
on
the
increase
from
the
producers.”
now,
some
of
these
distributing
companies
for
instance
the
united
gas
improvement
company
didn't
increase
its
rates
in
the
period
of
1950
to
1961.
during
this
period
of
jumping,
leaping,
bolting
prices,
it
increased
its
rates
once.
1.4
-
2%
to
recover
an
increase
on
the
gross
receipts
tax
in
pennsylvania.
it
has
since
filed
an
increase
based
on
the
fact
that
they
set
up
a
depreciation
accounting
situation.
now,
they
undoubtedly
will
refund
through
anything
that
they
pass
--
passed
on
or
that
they
have
collected
from
the
consumer
when
it
comes
back
if
there
is
anything.
they
will
do
it
and
the
commission
seeking
to
--
see
that
they
do
it.
i
only
mention
this
to
establish
the
fact
that
there
is
some
question
as
to
what
the
impact
on
the
consumer
has
been
and
before
the
producer
--
after
all,
the
natural
gas
act
was
for
the
consumer
is
not
to
protect
or
for
the
benefit
of
distributing
companies.
before
we
are
made
to
refund,
should
we
not
have
to
determine
whether
our
price
is
just
and
reasonable.
we
are
natural
gas
company
just
as
applied
by
mr.
justice
brennan
stated
in
summary.
i
don't
believe
i
have
anything
else
your
honors.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
mr.
justice
clark,
if
we
have
both
known
that
this
was
coming
up,
you
would
have
seen
however
many
applications
for
rehearing
as
you
would
want
to
see.
now,
i
have
a
copy
of
mine
here.
we
did
not
print
them
in
the
record
because
this
record
is
rather
expensive.
we
had
preserved,
we
looked
upon
our
application
for
rehearing
as
having
--
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
oh,
we
had
a
stipu
--
well,
yes,
the
record
is
put
together
through
a
stipulation
primarily
and
designation
by
the
parties
but
i
think
it
should
be
stipulated
perhaps
or
would
be
stipulated
that
we
raised
it
before
the
commission.
and
i
raise
it
in
my
reply
brief
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
this
is
my
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
before
the
commission,
yes,
sir.
i'd
be
happy
to
lodge
it
with
the
clark.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
yes,
a
clean
copy.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
it
--
well,
its
part
(inaudible)
--
but
it
isn't
printed
in
the
joint
appendix,
that's
the
problem.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
i
will
sir.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
oh,
no,
if
--
the
rest
of
the
record
with
pleadings,
remembering
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
oh,
it
isn't
here,
no.
this
is
what
was
before
the
fifth
circuit.
there's
much,
much
more
but
not
--
we
put
it
practically
all
of
the
evidence
on
summary,
fashioned
in
some
other.
we
could
get
it
together.
i'm
sure
we
can
show
the
--
incidentally,
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
--
certification
of
the
record
is
about
that
thick.
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
well,
i
will
capitalize
this
with
the
clerk
--
mr.
richard
f.
generelly
--
your
honor,
on
my
way
out
today.
thank
you
sir.
