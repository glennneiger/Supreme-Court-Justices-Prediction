that's
the
only
thing
that's
at
issue
here
is
a
refund
between
1959
and
1963.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
solomon,
if
you
win
on
the
refund
matter
and
the
case
is
resolved
as
you
suggest,
there
will
be
a
refund
obligation
from
1959
up
to
date
to
take
it
back
down
the
eight
--
to
the
20
cents?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
be
in-line
price
in
1963
or
--
and
then
raised
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
couldn't
they
have
done
--
what
was
the
reason
they
--
could
they
have
done
that?i
think
--
gather
from
what
you
just
said
a
minute
ago
that
they
could
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
they
would've
been
subject
to
refund
only
to
the
just
and
reasonable.
