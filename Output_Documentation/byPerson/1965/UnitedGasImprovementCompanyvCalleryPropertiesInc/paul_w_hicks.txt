mr.
paul
w.
hicks
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
also
raised
the
refund
issue
before
the
commission.
we
raised
the
question
of
the
proper
level
for
the
--
determining
the
amount
of
refunds
and
we
would
be
very
pleased
to
supply
the
court
with
copies
of
that
petition
if
the
court
desires.
they're
not
here.
they're
in
dallas,
texas
but
i
would
be
glad
to
supply
them
if
the
court
would
like
them
of
course.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
alright,
sir.
the
proper
measure
of
refunds
is
a
very
important
question
in
this
case
although
petitioners
did
not
really
meet
this
issue.
the
commission
merely
points
out
that
the
producers
assume
the
risk
by
commencing
deliveries
of
gas
before
the
certificates
became
final
that
is
before
while
they
were
still
subject
to
review.
the
new
york
commission
contends
that
restitution
must
be
made.
now
assuming
this,
it
still
doesn't
offer
any
aid
as
to
the
proper
measure
of
making
refunds
and
regardless
of
how
the
court
disposes
of
the
other
issues
in
this
case,
the
questions
with
respect
to
the
refunds
that
the
commission
has
ordered
us
to
make
covering
the
past
seven
years
now
should
be
determined
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
question
is
can
the
commission
require
producers
to
refund
a
portion
of
a
rate
that
is
below
a
just
and
reasonable
level.
we
think
not
as
this
court
said
in
united
gas
pipeline
company
versus
memphis
light
gas
and
water
division,
358
u.s.

page

business
reality
demands
that
natural
gas
companies
should
not
be
precluded
by
law
from
increasing
the
price
of
their
product
whenever
--
that
is
the
economically
necessary
means
of
keeping
the
intake
and
outgo
of
their
revenues
and
proper
balance.
now,
we
submit
at
this
same
principle
applies
after
the
money
has
been
collected
and
that
none
of
it
need
be
refunded
if
it
is
necessary
to
balance
the
outgo
and
we're
not
here
questioning
the
authority
of
the
commission
to
order
refunds
but
rather
the
measure
by
which
the
re
--
the
refunds
are
to
be
determined
and
if
so
--
to
be
determined
and
whether
they
are
--
whether
any
refunds
are
due
and
if
so,
the
proper
amount.
it
must
be
remembered
that
at
the
time
the
commission
issued
its
order
requiring
refunds
that
the
producers
had
been
delivering
gas
for
five
years
since
january
1959
and
since
that
time,
two
additional
years
have
passed
so
we
are
talking
about
the
refund
over
a
seven
year
period
between
the
contract
wise
of
23.55
cents
and
the
20
cents
which
includes
tax.
it
is
true
that
the
producers
commence
deliveries
before
the
certificates
became
final.
but
it's
also
true
that
no
producer
and
i
think,
i'd
be
safe
saying
no
other
party
thought
that,
anyone
would
ever
be
required
to
refund
prices
or
money
collected
below
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
we
just
felt
that
we
can
rely
upon
the
statute
and
the
constitution
to
retain
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
the
certificates
were
overturned
as
has
been
said
and
on
remand,
the
commission
determined
the
rate
including
tax
to
be
20
cents
per
mcf.
that's
the
in-line
rate.
and
as
a
condition
to
the
reissuance
of
these
certificates,
they
required
the
producers
to
refund
all
of
the
money
collected
above
the
20
cent
level
since
first
deliveries,
january
1959
to
date
even
though
that
20
cent
in-line
price
had
not
been
shown
to
be
just
and
reasonable.
now
in
doing
this,
the
commission
excluded
evidence
that
was
offered
to
demonstrate
that
the
contract
rates
were
just
and
reasonable
and
that
the
in-line
rate
was
confiscatory.
the
lower
court
ruled
that
refunds
could
only
be
made
to
the
extent
that
they
exceeded
a
just
and
reasonable
level.
the
full
import
of
this
lower
court's
ruling
is
simply
to
require
that
the
rates
for
the
period
prior
to
the
in-line
determination
be
just
and
reasonable
and
the
rates
for
the
period
after
the
in-line
determination
be
just
and
reasonable.
and
after
all,
that
is
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
act
is
to
have
just
and
reasonable
rates.
we
support
the
lower
court's
ruling
and
urge
your
honor
to
affirm
it
for
four
reasons.
first
and
perhaps
the
most
important
one,
it's
fair.
it's
fair
to
the
consumer,
it's
fair
to
the
producer.
commissioner
o'connor
dissented
from
the
commission
decision
on
this
refund
question.
he
said
that
equitable
considerations
compel
the
commission
to
allow
the
producers
to
file
increases
retroactively
if
the
rate
was
going
to
be
reduced
retroactively.
he
also
pointed
out
that
the
commission
staff
as
well
as
the
united
gas
improvement
company
seemed
to
sense
that
if
turning
the
clock
back,
it
saw
us
where
the
consumer
(inaudible),
it
is
equally
good
gravy
for
the
producer
(inaudible).
now,
the
lower
court
found
that
the
only
way
of
balancing
the
consumer
and
the
producer
needs
was
by
requiring
a
just
and
reasonable
determination
before
requiring
refunds.
now
it's
stated
that
could
be
in
a
proper
proceeding
not
necessarily
section
7
but
some
proceeding
before
requiring
refunds.
now
each
of
the
petitioners
in
arguing
in
support
of
the
evidentiary
issue
yesterday,
stress
the
fact
that
the
producers
have
the
right
upon
--
putting
into
an
effect
the
in-line
price,
the
20
cent
price
including
tax
to
immediately
file
an
increase
in
rate
back
up
to
the
initial
contract
rate
level,
23.55
and
to
collect
that
rate
subject
to
refund
pending
a
just
and
reasonable
determination.
now,
had
the
commission
fix
this
in-line
rate
of
20
cents
in
the
original
certificates
in
1958
and
1959
and
allowed
the
producers
to
at
that
time
increase
the
rate
from
the
20
cents
up
to
the
23.55
and
collect
it
subject
to
refund,
the
result
would
be
no
different
than
what
the
lower
court
ruling
requires.
the
second
reason
for
affirming
the
lower
court
on
this
issue
is
that
by
using
the
just
and
reasonable
standard
to
determine
refunds,
the
purpose
of
the
act
will
be
fulfilled
which
as
this
court
stated
in
catco
is
to
afford
consumers
a
complete,
permanent
and
effective
bond
of
protection
from
excessive
rates
and
charges.
now,
the
in-line
price
will
not
afford
the
consumer
this
same
protection
because
as
mr.
solomon
stated
yesterday,
sometimes
the
in-line
price
will
be
higher
than
the
just
and
reasonable
price.
where
that's
the
case,
the
consumer
will
be
paying
the
higher
price
until
a
just
and
reasonable
determination
and
at
that
time,
you'll
have
no
means
of
recouping
the
overcharges.
now
petitioners
talk
about
overcharges,
excessive
rates
and
windfall
and
runaway
prices
but
they
don't
explain
how
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
can
be
excessive
nor
can
they
because
congress
declared
that
any
rate
that
is
not
just
and
reasonable
is
unlawful.
now
clearly,
congress
didn't
intend
for
the
commission
to
force
the
producers
to
sell
gas
at
prices
below
just
and
reasonable
levels
for
a
seven
or
eight-year
period.
the
third
reason
for
affirming
the
lower
court
is
that
it
provides
for
the
only
reasonable
measure
of
refunds.
section
7
(e)
only
gives
the
commission
authority
to
attach
such
reasonable
conditions
as
the
public
interest
and
necessity
may
require
and
certainly,
a
condition
calling
for
refunds
below
a
just
and
reasonable
level
could
not
be
termed
reasonable.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
we
--
the
lower
court
granted
a
stay
on
compliance.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
and
that
difference
is
being
collected
subject
to
refund
under
orders
of
the
court.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
no,
just
from
the
date
of
the
commission's
order.
i
believe
it's
july
17,
1963
from
that
day
forward
or
with
effective
date
of
that
order.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
yes,
sir.
up
until
that
date,
we
collected
it
without
any
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
--
refund
obligation.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
since
that
date,
we've
collected
it
subject
to
refund
but
we've
(inaudible)
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
no,
just
subject
to
refund.
there's
no
pending
outcome
of
this
decision.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
well,
yes.
that's
what
the
court
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
sir?
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
to
1959,
date
of
first
deliveries.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
well,
the
commission
did
several
things
in
1963,
wanted
to
fix
the
price
at
20
cents
including
tax?
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
it
ordered
us
to
reduce
it.
we've
got
to
stay
on
that
provision.
another
condition
was
to
refund
everything
we'd
collected
above
that
rate
since
january
1959.
we
risk
--
got
to
stay
on
that
provision.
and
the
third
thing
was
the
moratorium
that
we
couldn't
raise
the
price
above
23.55.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
yes,
sir.
we'd
have
refunds
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
earlier.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
but
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
well,
i
believe
that
same
--
the
refund
would
also
be
an
issue
since
that
date
measured
for
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
but
i
believe
there
maybe
a
little
slight
difference
in
the
contract
prices
of
some
and
one
i
believe
maybe
23.8
and
maybe
one
less
than
23.55
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
i
don't
mean
we
could
have
gotten
part
without
the
other.
in
other
words,
if
we
put
the
price
into
effect,
we'd
had
to
--
refunded
everything
back
to
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
if
we
would
have
accepted
the
entire
order
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
you
see,
we
would
have
to
refund
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
--
back
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
--
and
would
have
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
now
i
don't
--
we
did
not.
let
me
make
this
clear.
we
did
not
petition
the
commission
to
take
it
in
pieces
but
it
was
our
understanding
or
our
feeling
that
if
we
could
not
take
it,
we
either
had
to
take
it
all
or
nothing.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
we
tried
it
in
another
case
and
we
were
unsuccessful.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
sir?
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
well,
we
tried
to
increase
the
rate
under
--
after
the
commission
lowered,
fixed
an
in-line
price
in
our
certificate
proceeding
and
they
reduced
the
price
and
we
then
attempted
to
increase
that
rate
while
--
and
at
the
same
time
appeal
it.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
we've
--
we
--
yes
sir,
they
rejected
the
filing.
they
excluded
evidence
in
this
case
clearly
shows
that
the
condition
grade
is
below
a
just
and
reasonable
level.
and
also,
it
wouldn't
be
reasonable
in
this
situation
to
require
refunds
on
an
in-line
basis
when
there
are
rate
cases
outstanding
or
pending
for
some
of
these
same
sales.
prior
to
the
commission's
order,
july
1963,
fixing
the
in-line
price
to
the
respondents,
hill
trustee
and
placid
file
for
rate
increases
up
to
25.55
cents
per
mcf.
the
commission
set
this
for
immediate
hearing
and
after
hearing
our
evidence
on
a
motion
of
staff
and
some
intervenors,
they
dismissed
it
on
the
ground
that
we
had
failed
to
sustain
our
burden
of
proof.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
the
commission
on
the
ground
that
they
failed
to
give
us
a
fair
hearing.
and
that
--
that's
hill
versus
federal
power
commission,
335
f.2d
355.
now,
we
have
not
yet
been
afforded
that
hearing.
so,
there
are
two
cases
that
are
pending,
two
rate
cases.
then
subsequent
to
the
commission's
in-line
determination
and
pursuant
to
the
stay,
excuse
me,
respondent
since
filed
for
a
rate
increase
to
24.55
cents
here
and
once
held
in
which
the
examiner
found
that
this
rate
was
just
and
reasonable,
the
24.55.
the
commission
disagreed
with
the
examiner
on
some
of
its
finding
but
did
not
make
any
findings
of
its
own
but
instead
deferred
this
case
until
the
one
we
have
here
today
has
been
decided.
so
there's
three
--
there
are
three
rate
cases
pending
that
are
involved
here.
finally,
we'd
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
lower
court's
ruling
on
the
just
and
reasonable
measure
for
determining
refunds
because
this
meets
the
constitutional
and
statutory
guarantees.
one
of
the
basic
elements
of
due
process
is
the
right
to
introduce
evidence
on
the
issue
on
whatever
--
on
the
mannered
issue.
to
date,
we
have
been
denied
the
right
to
introduce
any
evidence
on
the
question
of
refunds
or
on
the
confiscation
issue.
now,
we're
not
seeking
a
windfall,
we're
not
seeking
more
than
we're
entitled
to
do.
we're
seeking
the
right
only
for
a
hearing
to
show
or
to
demonstrate
what
are
just
and
reasonable
rates
are.
we
have
tried
in
every
way
we
know
to
obtain
a
hearing
but
to
date
we've
been
unable
to
have
one.that
is
one
in
which
the
commission
would
receive
and
consider
our
evidence.
now
yesterday,
the
commission
argued
that
the
producers
support
the
just
and
reasonable
measure
because
we
think
that
it's
higher
than
an
in-line
price
would
be
in
south
louisiana
and
they
related
--
he
related
that
some
way
to
permian
basin.
the
new
york
commission
speculated
that
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
in
south
louisiana
might
be
lower
than
the
in-line
rate.
and
the
united
gas
improvement
company
argued
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
excluding
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
the
fact
that
the
methods
of
allocation
did
not
comply
with
all
the
commission
opinions
existing
at
that
time.
it's
a
little
bit
difficult
to
answer
this
type
of
arguments
but
i
do
want
to
refer
to
the
document
mr.
generelly
referred
to
a
few
minutes
ago
which
i
think
answer
some
of
these
questions.
and
this
is
an
exhibit
that
the
staff
offered
in
the
south
louisiana
area
rate
proceeding.
it
is
purported
to
be
--
to
apply
the
methods
used
by
the
commission
in
the
permian
basin
decision
and
this
covers
81
companies,
all
81
companies
in
the
south
louisiana
area
rate
proceeding
whose
evidence
is
being
used
in
the
composite
for
determining
the
area
of
cost.
now,
one
of
the
things
that
stand
out
here
for
--
as
far
as
this
case
goes
is
that
placid
--
all
companies.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
thank
you
mr.
--
i
was
describing
this
document
that
the
federal
power
commission
staff
had
prepared
for
introduction
in
the
south
louisiana
area
proceeding.
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
two
or
three
things
that
was
in
line
with
the
argument
yesterday.
one,
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
cost
that
might
be
shown
in
our
excluded
evidence
and
what
might
be
found
in
south
louisiana,
placid
oil
company's
cost,
for
example,
which
does
not
include
three
items
as
i
understand
it,
severance
tax,
regulatory
expense
and
gathering
the
cost.
but
the
cost
that
are
involved
here,
placid's
is
24.3
cents
per
mcf.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
from
1960
and
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
just
one
year
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
no,
just
one
year
is
all
they
have.
test
year
1960.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
well,
they
are
literally
using
only
one
test
year
in
the
south
louisiana
area
of
rate
proceedings
as
i
understand
it.
at
the
same
time,
philips
petroleum
company's
cost
is
shown
to
be
23.83
cents
per
mcf.
just
about
a
half
percent
under
placid's.
in
philips
you
will
recall
is
in
a
neighborhood
of
11
or
12
cents
back
in
the
philips'
opinion
that
i
believe
came
before
your
honors
in
--
under
the
name
wisconsin
versus
fpc,
373
u.s.
294.
another
thing
i'd
like
to
say
about
this,
it
indicates
that
the
costs
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
not
too
different
from
what
the
evidence
shows
when
the
difference
in
methods
are
considered.
and
another
thing,
i
believe
someone,
i've
forgotten
which,
counsel
mentioned
it
yesterday
but
it
had
some
--
it's
indicated
what
a
mammoth
task
it
would
be
to
conduct
16
or
17
separate
cost
of
service
rate
cases
for
the
respondents.
well,
in
this
exhibit,
81
separate
cost
of
service
are
set
out
and
this
is
in
--
under
the
methods
used
by
the
commission
in
permian
and
i
understand
that
the
staff
was
directed
to
supply
this
data
by
the
presiding
examiner
three
or
four
weeks
ago.
so
it's
not
such
a
time
consuming
job
to
prepare
this
data
once
all
the
basic
information
is
at
hand.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
that's
81
separate
producers
in
south
louisiana
area
rate
proceeding.
the
commission
circulated
questionnaires
to
--
for
the
different
producers
to
complete
showing
their
cost,
their
revenues,
their
volumes
of
production,
and
so
on
and
they
received
81
which
they
are
using.
now
there
are
a
lot
more
producers
in
the
south
louisiana
but
these
are
the
ones
whose
date
they're
using.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
well,
each?
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
i
don't
think
they
can
fix
just
one
rate
without
confiscating
the
properties
of
many
producers.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
there
are
different
--
there
are
so
many
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
yes
sir.
and
different
areas
and
different
fields,
the
cost
is
difference
between
--
different
between
fields
so
i
don't
think
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
mr.
--
you
must
remember
that
there
is
a
ceiling
above
which
we
cannot
negotiate
a
contract.
the
purchaser
has
to
be
willing
to
pay
a
price
no
matter
if
our
cost
is
$5
an
mcf.,
we
can't
negotiate
a
contract.
so
we
have
a
ceiling,
natural
ceiling
at
market
level.
so
that's
the
first
ceiling
we
have
and
then
after
we
negotiate
a
contract.
i
think
the
commission
must
not
bankrupt
just
to
--
and
take
our
property
away
by
failing
to
consider
our
special
circumstances
or
the
facts
of
our
case.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
well,
that
is
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
oh,
no,
sir.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
no,
sir.
we
can't
--
the
most
expensive
company
can't
sell
its
gas
for
anything
like
the
cost.
for
example,
on
this
exhibit
shows
the
highest
cost
to
be
$2.89
an
mcf.
that
company
can't
get
$2.89
for
its
gas.
it
never
will.
its
contract
would
not
be
any
higher
than
--
well,
its
23.55
or
somewhere
at
the
most.
so
that's
the
maximum
and
then
would
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
yes,
sir.
but
then
there's
a
lot
of
variation
in
time
in
which
those
contracts
were
negotiated
also.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
well,
that
would
be
the
most
precise
year
by
year.
but
if
they
can't
fix
our
individual
rates
year
by
year
or
company
by
company,
they
certainly
can't
fix
an
area
and
still
provide
everyone
with
due
process
and
with
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
it
has
to
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
well,
you
see,
if
you'll
just
remember
that
this
maximum
ceiling
that
is
placed
on
us
by
market
value,
the
purchaser
will
not
pay
more
than
so
much,
23
cents
or
21
cents.
and
anyone
who
has
caused
above
that,
they
--
you
don't
need
to
--
really
just
enough
to
see
that
their
cost
above
that,
then
those
rates
would
be
--
should
be
considered
acceptable
because
they're
selling
you
might
say
at
a
salvage
bag,
that's
all
they
can
get.
it
wouldn't
be
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
could
you
mean
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
yes,
sir.
but
if
there's
a
--
if
there
is
an
adequate
supply
or
something
like
an
adequate
supply,
the
price,
if
that
price
is
fixed
on
that,
you
can't
sell
a
gas
at
a
higher
price
just
because
your
cost
are
high.
you've
got
to
find
the
bar.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
no,
sir.
i'm
talking
about
--
that's
one.
that's
the
first
ceiling,
yes,
sir.
that's
the
first
ceiling,
then
after
that,
we're
regulated
by
the
commission.
the
commission
as
i
understand
it
has
no
authority
to
raise
our
price
above
those
contract
rates
unless
it
finds
that
the
public
interest
requires
it
and
i
think
that's
a
very
strict
finding
there.
it
would
had
to
find
it
--
i
just
can't
conceive
of
any
situation
where
the
top
price
would
be
raised.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
well,
we
wouldn't
--
i
don't
believe
we'd
be
compelled
to
sell
until
after
we
started
deliveries
and
we
would
have
to
have
a
contract
which
would
have
a
ceiling
in
it
before
we
could
come
to
the
commission
and
ask
for
permission
to
sell.
so,
i
don't
--
i
think
some
of
those
problems
are
not
likely
to
occur.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
i
would
like
to
mention
very
briefly
about
the
record.
it's
the
practice
in
the
fifth
circuit
i
believe
always
in
the
federal
power
commission
cases
to
file
briefs
and
designate
the
portions
of
the
record
to
be
printed
so
that
the
entire
record
does
not
have
to
be
printed
just
portions
that
the
parties
designate
and
this
is
the
record
that
was
printed
for
the
fifth
circuit
and
these
applications
for
rehearing
before
the
commission
were
not
contested.
that
is
the
issues
that
--
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
well,
i
don't
think
the
--
any
more
than
this
is
in
your
files
but
these
applications
for
rehearing.
we
will
be
glad
to
have
them
printed
or
we'll
be
glad
to
send
them
up
to
all
the
parties,
well,
if
your
honors
desire.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
well,
you
don't
normally,
i
would
add
this,
we
don't
--
it's
really
our
stipulation
of
the
record
between
the
parties
of
what
goes
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
think
that
everything
is
in
the
record
that
was
properly.
mr.
paul
w.
hicks
i
do
have
few
briefs.
