mr.
kent
h.
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
one
year
before
this
court
decided
catco
in
june
of
1959,
mr.
justice
bazelon
speaking
in
the
d.c.
circuit
in
an
oklahoma
natural
case,
in
the
same
context
of
history
of
every
increasing
upward
price
spiral
or
new
gas
dedications,
“when
substantial
question
exists
as
to
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
the
rates
involved
in
a
certificate
application,
the
commission,
if
it
does
not
impose
a
rate
condition
and
if
it
does
not
upon
the
evidence
satisfy
itself
that
the
proposed
rates
are
just
and
reasonable
cannot
certify
the
project
as
being
required
by
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.”
in
other
words
according
to
that
doctrine
when
the
fpc
is
confronted
with
a
high
price
certificate
application,
it
has
three
alternatives.
it
may
deny
it
out
of
hand
as
being
obviously
disruptive
of
the
market.
secondly,
it
may
grant
it
subject
to
a
price
reducing
condition.
third,
it
may
grant
it
upon
a
demonstration
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
requires
that
this
be
done
notwithstanding
the
excessively
high
price.
the
choice
is
the
commission's.
what
the
commission
may
not
do
is
to
certify
unconditionally
without
a
finding
a
price
to
be
just
and
reasonable.
it
may
but
it
need
not
pursue
such
an
inquiry
in
a
section
7
context.
it
may
elect
to
defer
such
considerations
to
a
section
4
or
section
5
context
in
a
proceeding.
catco's
decision
of
this
court
substantially
confirmed
that
thesis.
at
least
that
was
clear
enough
to
us
at
the
time.
it
did
not
seem
to
be
quite
so
clear
to
a
reluctant
commission
and
a
large
number
of
producers.
we
therefore
had
to
parade
six
catco
counterpart
cases
through
5
courts
of
appeals
and
on
ten
certiorari
applications
to
this
court
all
denied
to
engrain
the
lesson
the
instant
certificate
applications
are
the
last
of
some
70
odd
so
considered
and
so
reversed
and
so
remanded
for
rectification
in
accordance
with
the
ground
rules
espoused
by
this
court
in
catco.
throughout
that
track,
up
and
down
the
courts
of
this
country
demonstrating
that
this
court
meant
what
it
said
when
it
decided
catco.
we
encountered
some
15
members
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
one
and
one
alone
dissented
from
the
thesis
we
were
advocating.
his
dissent
was
based
fundamentally
upon
a
repugnance
on
his
part
toward
the
thesis
that
this
commission,
the
fpc
could
be
given
the
pragmatic
authorization
to
hold
the
line
on
certificate
applications
pending
it's
evolution
of
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
in
other
contexts
which
of
course
was
the
adjournment
of
this
court.
now,
by
reason
of
the
appeal
below
and
reversal
of
the
commission's
action,
the
same
author
of
that
dissent
has
made
his
views
of
this
court.
we
think
he
was
in
error
the
first
time.
we
think
he
is
in
even
more
grievous
error
today
and
i
hasten
to
add
though
our
names
are
similar,
we
are
not
related.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
yes
sir.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
none
specifically
addressed
to
that
aspect
of
this
area
sir
but
there
has
been
a
revival
of
interest
in
each
section
of
congress
or
efforts
to
modify
the
natural
gas
act
in
ways
which
to
us
add
up
to
or
would
be
tantamount
to
its
repeal
insofar
as
producer
regulation
is
concerned.
such
efforts
have
not
succeeded.
following
the
many
courts
of
appeal
decisions
and
reversal
and
the
--
finally
--
final
engraving
of
the
beliefs
that
this
court
meant
what
it
said
in
catco,
the
commission
under
new
leadership
did
do
a
commendable
job
in
performing
the
duties
the
court
--
this
court
pointed
out
that
it
might
and
should
discharged.
in
the
section
7
initial
price
contexts,
it
concentrated
its
effort
upon
maintenance
of
the
initial
price
line
to
prevent
disruption
and
to
prevent
escalations
and
to
maintain
it
at
a
status
quo
pending
the
evolution
of
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
in
other
context.
that
was
the
adjournment
of
catco.
in
the
other
context
with
the
blessing
of
this
court
in
the
second
philips
case,
the
commission
launched
itself
on
an
area
rate
making
process
which
envisions
fixation
of
a
rate
to
be
held
to
be
just
and
reasonable
for
all
producers
in
a
given
area
not
on
the
basis
of
an
individual
company
cost
of
service
determination
but
rather
on
an
overall
and
with
consideration
of
all
aspects
of
need
of
the
industry
and
to
the
public
interest.
those
decisions
are
now
just
now
beginning
to
evolve
and
hopefully
they
will
solve
of
the
problems
of
the
industry
though
we
will
simply
not
know
that
for
another
several
years
until
at
least
one
or
more
of
them
have
been
before
this
court.
the
point
is
however
that
in
those
proceedings
every
opportunity
is
afforded
the
producer
to
demonstrate
that
public
need
necessity
requires
the
gas
to
be
sold
by
him
to
us
at
higher
amounts
so
that
he
will
be
inspired
to
go
out
and
find
more
for
us.
every
opportunity
is
afforded
him
to
demonstrate
that
there
is
some
other
necessity
for
higher
initial
prices
than
have
been
allowed
in
the
past
such
as
the
falling
off
of
the
production
and
consumption
ratios
and
features
and
factors
of
that
kind.
in
other
words,
the
supply
and
demand
concerns
the
cost
of
service
concerns
that
were
the
essence
of
the
evidence
that
they
sought
in
2000
pages
to
introduce
into
the
remand
proceedings
below
in
this
certificate
context
which
hadn't
been
considered
and
accepted.
it
would've
had
--
have
been
rebutted
and
considered
by
us
and
by
the
commission
counsel
and
it
would
have
in
effect
converted
the
expeditious
certificate
proceeding
into
another
area
rate
proceeding
when
there
was
one
already
well
along
the
proceeding
in
rooms
down
the
hall.
we
think
that
both
dedications
of
the
commission
have
been
authorized
by
explicit
decisions
of
this
court
namely
catco
and
philips,
number
2.
hence,
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
that
the
exclusion
of
this
evidence
was
tendered
in
the
wrong
context
was
in
violation
of
the
statute
and
could
not
be
sustained,
flies
directly
in
the
face
of
this
court's
holdings
and
directions
in
catco
as
interpreted
and
applied
by
court
after
court
after
court
since
this
court
decided
that
case.
the
fixation
of
the
initial
price
line
in
this
instance
for
1957,
1958
and
1959
contracts
at
18
and
a
half
cents.
for
offshore
gas,
20
cents,
for
on
shore
gas
is
completely
consistent
with
the
action
of
the
commission
upon
the
remand
of
the
catco
case
itself.
it
is
completely
consistent
with
the
directions
of
the
court
of
appeals
throughout
the
country
as
to
how
the
line
is
to
be
determined.
it
is
in
fact
very
generous
and
that
most
of
the
gas
flowing
at
that
period
of
time
other
than
that
involved
with
catco
tainted
contracts
was
flowing
at
considerably
less
than
18
and
a
half
cents.
on
the
moratorium
issue
as
has
been
pointed
out
to
the
court
at
the
time
the
new
certificates
were
issued
on
the
remand
proceeding
in
this
case
the
contracts
here
involved
had
gone
through
or
by
to
one
or
more
of
their
triggering
escalation
authorizations
and
were
certificates
to
be
issued
to
these
producers
at
20
cents
within
a
matter
of
3
seconds
they
could
file
for
rates
in
excess
of
23.55
or
higher
or
upon
analysis
of
the
contracts
with
the
pipelines
served
by
these
companies,
these
producers,
perfectly
obvious
that
any
filing
in
excess
of
23.55
was
quite
likely
to
be
tripped
and
triggered.
hosts
of
other
contracts
in
the
southern
louisiana
area
and
we
would
have
a
major
move
upward
to
the
cost
of
our
gas
coming
from
that
area.
hence,
in
order
to
preserve
the
status
quo
for
the
limited
period
of
time
pending
the
decision
in
new
york
612,
the
southern
louisiana
area
rate
case
for
july
1,
1967
whichever
is
later
and
incidentally
that
date
i
think
came
as
a
product
of
similar
moratorium
agreements
in
settlement
proceedings
with
producers
engineered
by
us
as
5
year
period
of
--
in
accord
in
which
--
during
which
time
they
would
not
file
for
increases.
if
the
southern
louisiana
rate
decision
is
not
down
by
that
date
in
view
of
the
cluster
of
the
cutoff
dates
of
june
1,
1967
including
now
these
here,
chaos
might
result
on
june
2
if
we
do
not
have
a
southern
louisiana
just
and
reasonable
price.
finally,
on
the
final
determination
of
the
commission
on
the
refund
authorization
in
settlement
after
settlement
of
high
price
certificate
cases
there's
never
been
much
of
it
in
this
court
about
the
obligation
of
the
producer
who
enjoyed
the
fruits
of
an
erroneous
certification
at
an
excessively
high
price
having
to
rectify
it
in
part
at
least
by
effecting
a
refund
to
the
difference
between
what
he
received
and
what
he
should
have
been
receiving
during
a
period
had
he
been
tendered
a
certificate
correctly
in
the
first
place.
we
have
bargained
a
way
for
other
considerations
portions
of
this
entitlement
of
the
public
where
their
money
is
returned
in
order
to
buy
our
piece
for
instance
for
the
5
year
moratorium
period.
but
there's
never
been
any
real
dispute
of
the
obligation
to
affect
the
refund.
in
fact
in
catco
on
remand
directions
were
made
by
the
commission
for
full
refunds
to
be
made
there.
the
case
was
appealed
and
was
settled
before
it
was
determined
so
that
the
producers
are
quite
correct
and
that
there
has
not
yet
been
a
definitive
determination
by
a
court
that
in
the
circumstance
such
as
this
where
an
excessively
high
price
certificate
has
been
issued
the
producers
start
to
sell
before
--
the
certificate
becomes
final.
we
appeal
the
case
to
the
courts
and
revere
--
and
get
it
reversed.
it
is
remanded
and
he
is
then
given
a
new
certificate
or
a
corrected
certificate
at
an
initial
price
which
is
considerably
less
than
the
original.
justice,
law
and
all
the
rules
that
i
know
of
in
the
subject
of
restitution
pertain
and
require
that
the
excess
sums
received
be
repaid.
after
all
we
didn't
attack
the
excessively
high
price
certificate
just
for
the
exercise.
we
were
representing
the
consumers
who
had
paid
the
excessive
price.
true,
we
were
interested
in
getting
it
reduced
for
future
deliveries.
we
were
just
as
interested
in
restoring
to
them
the
amounts
that
have
been
taken
from
them
under
an
improper
certificate.
therefore
the
court
below
agreed
with
us
that
the
producers'
result
upon
the
commission's
of
authority
to
affect
the
refund
was
misguided
and
held
and
we
agreed
with
it
that
the
commission
had
the
power
to
direct
or
condition
the
final
certificate
in
such
a
way
that
the
producer
would
effect
a
return
of
excess
that
he
collected
during
the
task
period
of
time.
in
number
26
(inaudible)
mr.
kent
h.
brown
yes
your
honor.
in
that
respect,
that
aspect
of
the
court's
holding
below
is
simply
a
consistent
application
of
its
decision
that
the
conditioning
standard
for
the
new
certificate
should
be
in
the
context
of
the
evidence
offered
by
the
producers,
i.e
the
just
and
reasonableness
or
an
equivalent
finding
instead
of
the
in
lineness.
hence,
consistent
with
that
decision
the
court
below
said
any
refunds
should
be
the
difference
between
the
just
and
reasonable
standard
and
the
excess.
it's
simply
a
consistency
of
the
two
holdings
and
then
having
we
believe
committed
error
in
the
first
we
are
also
to
view
that
the
latter
is
equally
erroneous.
that
the
difference
should
be
the
difference
between
what
the
certificates
should've
been
priced
at
originally
under
all
the
rules
that
we
now
pertained
and
that
that
it
was.
in
other
words
the
excess
paid.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
you'd
mean
something
differently
viewed.
or
presupposing
a
higher
one
perhaps
or
higher
than
a
just
--
the
higher
than
the
in
line
price?
that
is
a
risk
--
mr.
kent
h.
brown
that
is
a
risk
of
course
that
every
producer
accepting
a
certificate
at
any
price
just
assumed
to
run.
if
there
is
some
thought
in
mind
that
the
ultimate
just
and
reasonable
price
will
be
determined
a
figure
higher,
his
acceptance
of
a
certificate
that's
something
less
is
a
risk
of
his
or
a
business
judgment
of
his.
but
assuming
that
he
has
no
prerogative
to
file
for
an
increase,
assume
no
contract
authorization
to
bring
himself
to
a
higher
level
that
is
his
decision.
in
fact
however,
i
meant
your
inquiry
judge
harlan,
if
the
permian
decision
which
is
already
out,
it
is
meaningful
and
if
the
principles
there
applied
were
to
be
translated
to
southern
louisiana,
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
supposition
or
the
assumption
that
you
make
is
baseless.
there
is
every
likelihood
in
other
words
that
the
just
and
reasonable
price
of
the
area
rate
to
be
fixed
will
not
exceed,
in
fact
there
would
be
less
than
the
in
line
prices
fixed
for
that
area
and
all
the
rest
of
them.
that
however
is
pure
speculation
i
hasten
to
add.
it's
a
translation
of
the
principles
used
in
the
permian
into
a
southern
louisiana
context.
you
were
here
in
number
26
to
follow
that
the
commission
had
no
authority
to
affect
the
refund
because
it
transgressed
a
line
of
cases
denying
it
reparation
authority.
i
think
that
this
distinction
have
been
pointed
out
to
you
by
mr.
solomon.
those
cases
hinge
upon
the
assumption
that
a
permanent
certificate
has
been
outstanding
with
--
and
the
time
for
appeal
has
gone
by.
there
is
of
course
no
authorization
under
the
national
gas
act
for
the
commission
to
go
back
and
make
a
task
study
of
what
it
did
in
authorizing
that
certificate
in
effect
toward
direct
refunds.
that
is
clearly
reparation.
that
is
quite
different
from
the
case
here
involved
where
the
producers
started
the
sale
knowing
that
he
had
a
tenuous
piece
of
paper
which
got
rectified
by
judicial
reversals.
we
are
also
told
in
the
same
context
that
we,
the
new
york
commission
is
at
fault
and
should
be
barred
from
or
our
consumers
should
be
barred
from
collecting
any
of
these
refunds
because
we
neglected
back
in
1958
to
rush
before
the
courts
before
which
we
had
brought
the
review
proceedings
and
get
a
stay
order
prohibiting
the
producers
instituting
the
sales
because
once
instituted
they
could
not
stop
them.
and
once
instituted
they
now
say
that
they
are
entitled
to
keep
whatever
they
got
their
hands
on.
in
other
words
we
were
supposed
to
have
gotten
to
stay
to
prevent
them
from
committing
suicide.
i
can't
see
the
argument.
i
think
it's
pointless.
if
the
court
please,
in
conclusion
we
feel
quite
strongly
that
unless
the
decision
below
is
reversed
and
the
decision
of
the
federal
power
commission
in
this
remand
case
context
confirmed
on
all
counts
it
will
be
tantamount
to
a
complete
destruction
of
everything
that
has
been
accomplished
in
the
past
decade
in
this
field,
initial
price
controls
will
have
been
abolished.
we
will
have
area
rate
proceedings
sabotaged
by
having
them
transferred
into
certificate
contexts,
certificates
will
issue
only
upon
paying
months
and
by
months
upon
months
of
hearings
and
record
compilations
of
no
purpose
and
of
no
import
and
of
no
necessity.
we
think
that
the
decision
below
flies
in
the
face
of
this
court's
decisions
consistent
starting
with
catco,
transco,
seaboard,
hunt
on
moratoriums
and
texaco
on
moratoriums.
we
think
it
flies
in
the
face
of
everyone
of
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
following
catco,
the
6th
ugi-psc
cases.
we
think
it
flies
in
the
face
of
