mr.
herbert
w.
varner
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
would
like
to
comment
for
just
a
moment
about
the
present
in-line
approach
that
goes
to
the
questions
that
two
or
three
members
have
asked
in
the
last
few
moments
having
to
do
with
what
we
do
in
by
question
the
so-called
suspect
price
doctrine
in
determining
the
line
of
price.
and
i
would
not
only
point
out
that
we
question
but
while
we
did
not
brief
in
this
case
the
issue
of
the
propriety
of
the
level
of
the
in-line
price.
the
reason
we
didn't
do
it
is
at
least
in
my
view,
i
thought
that
question
not
to
be
comprised
within
the
questions
upon
which
this
court
had
granted
certiorari
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
we
didn't
do
it.
now
i
did
point
out
in
my
brief
that
the
resolution
of
the
proper
level
of
the
in-line
price
which
the
court
below
did
not
consider
although
the
issue
has
hardly
contested
there.
it
involves
a
considerable
number
of
both
questions
of
law
and
fact.
now
going
back
to
the
--
shall
we
say
creator
of
the
so-called
suspect
price
doctrine
and
that
is
the
ninth
circuit
court.
it
will
be
recalled
that
at
the
time
of
that
proceeding
which
was
shall
we
say,
shortly
after
the
catco
situation.
there
were
any
number
of
cases
then
pending
on
appeal,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
other
than
the
third
circuit
which
had
been
summarily
are
reversed
by
this
court.
i
believe
was
the
first
of
all
of
the
court
of
appeals
courts
to
consider
the
remanded
19
--
of
the
1959
series
of
orders
by
the
commission
which
are
the
basis
originally
of
this
current
procedures.
and
there
they
said
in
response
to
a
contention
made
by
one
of
the
petitioners
here,
united
gas
improvement
company
that
certainly
the
commission
in
trying
to
determine
what
the
line
of
price
is
or
not
to
consider
as
fixed.
these
prices
which
to
say
is
certificated
and
which
were
presently
before
they
said,
court
or
judicial
--
i
mean,
commission
or
judicial
review.
now
the
reason
for
that
statement
was,
a
good
many
were
then
pending
before
the
courts
of
appeals
and
the
third
circuit
case,the
transco-seaboard
case
is
the
generic
term
of
it,
had
already
been
remanded
back
to
the
commission.
so
they
were
pending
there
both
before
the
commission
and
the
courts
on
review.
and
it
said,
certainly,
those
case
--
those
prices
are
subject
to
modification.
so
you're
not
--
they're
unreliable
for
any
purpose
of
determining
a
price
line.
then
they
went
further
and
said,
"and
therefore,
prices
of
similar
nature,
of
similar
amount
is
what
they
said
really,
which
are
subject
to
the
same
infirmities
are
under
a
cloud
and
ought
not
to
be
relied
upon
unless
you
can
show
it
in
that
subject
to
the
same
infirmities",
as
my
colleague
has
pointed
out.
the
only
infirmity
of
catco
was
insufficiency
of
evidence.
if
you
have
a
final,
non-reviewable
order
then
of
course
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
commission
did
or
did
not
properly
on
the
record
have
evidence
before
it
becomes
immaterial
just
cannot
attack
those
orders.
they're
valid
on
their
face
and
not
subject
to
collateral
attack.
now
there
was
one
further
point
and
i
think
this
is
most
important
in
the
ninth
circuit.
there
were
a
number
of
cases
in
one
of
which
i
happen
to
participate.
in
which
either
the
united
gas
improvement
company
or
the
public
service
commission
of
the
state
of
new
york
had
sought
to
intervene,
had
been
denied
intervention
by
the
commission
had
taken
the
issue
of
their
right
if
any
to
intervene
to
the
courts
and
had
been
--
and
there,
the
commission
had
been
sustained.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
were
two
separate
cases.
in
one,
the
new
york
public
service
commission
was
denied
the
right
to
intervene
because
it
has
waited
too
long
and
was
a
procedural
effect.
in
the
other,
they
were
permitted
too.
but
now,
that
proceeding
involved
a
hotly
contested
original
certificate
matter
involving
all
the
trunk
line
sales
not
all
but
involving
the
trunk
line
sales
and
i
would
say
--
i
hesitate
(inaudible)
--
hazard
i
guess
but
about
20
separate
document
--
dockets.
now,
all
of
those
cases
had
been
certificated
by
the
commission.
they
were
final
and
they
were
on
appeal
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
appealed
without
success.
as
to
those,
ugi
said,
we've
been
denied
the
right
to
intervene.
we
couldn't
go
in
and
show
how
bad
we
thought
those
prices
were
so
you
ought
not
to
consider
them
for
the
price
line.
the
ninth
circuit
court
said
without
equivocation
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
you
did,
whether
you
tried
to
get
in
and
were
denied
or
whether
you
didn't
even
try
to
get
in.
if
those
cases
are
now
unappealable,
when
we
look
in
--
at
a
price
line,
not
cost,
not
anything
just,
a
price,
group
of
prices
and
then
those
prices
have
to
be
considered.
now
--
so
to
that
extent,
we
certainly
do
deny
or
take
issue
with
the
suspect
price
doctrine.
i
didn't
as
i
--
i
don't
know
what
to
comment
on
this
or
not.
i
didn't
bring
the
other
issue
on
this
in-line
price
but
that
is
the
tax
imbursement
feature
which
again
the
ninth
circuit
held
was
a
part
of
the
initial
price.
the
commission
determined
here
a
price
of
18.5
cents
and
they
said
that's
the
in-line
price.
incidentally,
that's
the
same
price.
it
was
in-line
in
1954.
it
was
in-line
in
1956,
and
they've
now
found
that
it's
in-line
in
1960.
they
found
only
because
in
the
remanded
catco
decision
that
they
had
used
a
1.5
cent
tax
reimbursement
for
the
information
if
necessary
to
the
court,
the
tax
in
louisiana
onshore
where
the
state
has
jurisdiction
is
2.3
cents
per
thousand.
almost
all
of
the
purchased
contracts
or
sales
contracts
by
the
producers
provide
for
some
percentage
of
reimbursement
of
that
tax.
and
so,
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
percentage
of
the
2.3.
now
--
and
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
situation
in
this
case
involving
superior's
united
gas
contract
and
that
contract
is
shown
in
the
record
in
full
at
page
153.
that
particular
contract
happens
to
provide
for
100%
of
the
then
existing
2.3
cent
tax.
now,
there
is
absolutely
no
and
i
do
repeat
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
will
justify
the
finding
of
1.5
cents
tax
reimbursement.
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
is
to
the
effect
that
if
you
look
at
all
of
the
contracts
of
comparable
period,
the
tax
reimbursement
was
subject
to
error,
it's
shown
upon
exhibit
6,
i
think
it
was
1.72.
if
you
looked
at
the
contracts
with
current
dates
and
the
same
type
of
prices,
21.5
cents,
21.4
cents
base
price
and
57
and
58.
the
average
of
those
prices,
the
tax
reimbursement
provided
was
2.1
cent,
2.01.
so,
we
do
in
fact
take
considerable
issue
with
that
matter.
now
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
well,
i
think
this.
if
you're
looking
at
a
price
line,
if
that's
the
basis
of
this
thing
then
you've
got
to
determine
and
i
sincerely
suggest
that
no
--
many
courts
have
had
difficulty
in
determining
just
exactly
what
this
court
meant
when
it
said
an
out
of
line
price.
and
the
reason
i
think
that
someone
--
certainly
they're
--
is
because
they
don't
know
what
prices
are
to
be
considered
for
determining
what
the
line
is
other
than
what
i
said
about
the
ninth
circuit's
decision.
now
mr.
justice
clark,
i'd
say
that
if
you're
going
to
fix
a
price
on
the
basis
of
nothing
but
line
of
price,
the
tax
reimbursement
has
to
be
either
what
my
contract
provides
for
or
it
has
to
be
what
the
range
of
prices
i
suppose
on
the
in-line
approach
would
justify.
now
that
range
as
i
say,
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it
in
this
case
is
going
to
be
an
excess
of
1.5.
now
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
no,
sir.
i
didn't
say
the
medium.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
i
said
the
average.
now,
this
has
taken
all
the
prices.
some
which
--
some
contracts
make
no
provision
for
tax
reimbursement,
there
are
very
few,
very
few.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
no,
sir.
but
i
might
tell
you
that
is
truly
the
--
that's
the
--
that
represents
the
section
7
hearing
now
accorded
by
the
commission.
that's
just
about
it.
we
take
all
the
prices,
we
add
them
up.
now,
i
think
that
it's
the
commission
brief
that
says
that
the
in-line
price
is
the
highest
price.
i
would
certainly
like
to
challenge
that.
in
catco
on
remand,
the
commission
went
to
considerable
length
to
point
out
that
the
in-line
price
is
not
the
highest
price
or
not
the
highest
group
of
prices
but
something
--
a
price
that
which
substantial
quantities
of
moved.
i
can't
believe
that
that
was
what
this
court
meant
when
it
was
talking
about
in
catco,
a
price
25%
higher
than
tennessee
gas
had
ever
paid
for
any
gas
anywhere,
4.4
cents
more
than
tennessee
had
paid
for
the
west
delta
gas,
i
believe
it
was.
a
price
that
was
70%
higher
than
tennessee
gas
then
weighted
average
cost
of
purchased
gas.
and
they've
said
this
is
out
of
line.
well,
i
think
i
would
be
the
first
to
concede
it
was
out
of
line
and
yet
it
had
been
certificated
without
condition
by
the
commission
on
a
record
which
in
the
words
of
this
court
showed
little
more
than
the
printed
contracts.
now
under
those
circumstances,
of
course
the
court
found
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
justify
this
rate,
25%
higher
than
anybody
else
ever
paid
as
being
required
by
the
public
interest
and
therefore,
you
remanded
the
case.
now,
i
would
like
to
get
over
the
fact
that
at
least
in
my
view
and
i
think
it
was
out
of
the
court
below,
the
entirety
of
the
in-line
approach
violates
the
general
purpose
of
the
natural
gas
act
as
this
court
has
declared
that
purpose.
that
is
to
provide
natural
gas
at
the
lowest,
possible,
reasonable
rate
consistent
with
the
maintenance
of
adequate
service
in
the
public
interest.
now,
why
did
i
say
that?
first,
because
as
i've
mentioned
before,
when
you
look
at
the
price
line,
you
don't
look
at
how
those
prices
got
there.
you
don't
look
at
how
they
got
certificated
if
you're
going
to
take
the
certification
as
a
qualification.
you
just
say
they
are
there
so
now
look
at
the
prices
and
then
the
commission
says,
“but
we're
not
going
to
look
at
any
prices
higher
than
the
catco
18.5
cent
price
because
anything
else
has
been
affected,
tainted,
infected
or
in
some
manner
influenced
and
of
course,
the
commission
said,
we
have
no
doubt
of
that
and
yet
the
record
in
this
case
i
submit,
shows
just
exactly
to
the
contrary.
dr.
foster
said,
“that
wasn't
the
situation.”
he
said
that
price
has
hadn't
even
gone
from
plateau
to
plateau.
he
pointed
out
that
from
1940
--
i
think
he
used
1947
and
1949
as
an
average,
that
using
that
average
enough
to
1960,
the
price
of
gas,
the
highest
price
had
gone
up
22%
during
which
period
of
time,
the
cost
of
drilling
for
new
gas
supply
had
gone
up
52%
in
the
same
area.
that
is
why
when
you
get
to
price
line
and
you
realize
that
those
prices
were
not
based
upon
cost.
they
don't
represent
just
and
reasonable
prices.
they
are
prices
which
happen
to
have
been
certificated.
and
getting
back
for
a
moment
to
this
matter
of
infirmity,
if
the
infirmity
there
has
to
do
with
the
commission's
approach
in
certificating
these
prices,
i
respectfully
submit
every
certificated
price
in
the
united
states
is
subject
to
infirmity.
not
one
has
been
based
upon
anything
other
than
this
is
the
price
the
parties
agreed
upon
and
it
looks
to
us
like
it
must
be
alright
and
it's
in
the
public
interest.
now,
what
did
they
do
as
my
colleague
pointed
out?
in
the
catco
situation
they
said,
“if
this
price
is
like
any
price
that's
previously
been
paid
then
it's
alright.
and
this
court
reversed
them,
why?
they
say,
“you
can't
just
ignore
the
issue
of
price
in
the
public
convenience.”
you
came
--
just
look
at
the
maintenance
of
adequate
service.
now,
what
are
they
doing
now?
they
have
turned
the
situation
exactly
backwards.
now,
they
disregard
the
maintenance
of
adequate
service
and
looked
only
to
price.
i
think
my
colleague
said
that
he
believes
that
they
should
have
taken
a
middle
ground.
i
think,
maybe
in
the
same
principle
but
a
little
different
expression.
they
should
have
followed
what
this
court
said.
they
should
have
evaluated
all
of
the
factors
of
public
convenience
and
those
are
the
factors.
in
other
words,
what
is
the
price
proposed?
is
this
required?
now
in
that
light,
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
mind
its
own
hunt
conversation.
that
case
involved
temporary
certification
and
we
don't
here
have
that
same
problem.
but
significantly,
in
considering
the
certificating
power
and
conditioning
power
of
the
commission
under
section
7,
the
court
referred
to
the
1942
amendment
of
section
7
of
the
natural
gas
act.
the
court
there
pointed
out
that
the
very
purpose
of
this
1942
amendment
was
to
permit
the
commission
to
--
shall
i
use
the
words
of
the
court
in
catco,
carefully
scrutinize
and
evaluate
the
financial
set
up,
the
adequacy
of
gas
reserves,
the
feasibility
and
adequacy
of
the
proposed
service,
and
the
characteristic
--
the
financial
characteristic
--
no,
the
characteristic
of
the
rate
structure
of
the
act.
they
said
and
i
think
also
they
took
these
words
from
the
--
from
congress
that
these
were
vital
matters
to
certification,
vital
matters
that
ought
to
be
considered
by
the
commission
at
the
time
of
certification.
i
respectfully
submit
that
looking
only
to
pass
certificated
prices,
not
a
single
one
of
those
vital
matters
is
even
touched
upon.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
your
honor,
if
that
had
happened,
i
would
refer
you
to
the
record
and
dr.
foster
testified
and
he
also
has
a
schedule
and
that
schedule
is
a
--
is
shown
at
page
297
of
the
record.
in
looking
at
all
permanently
certificated
sales
on
the
new
contracts
which
would
be
the
seventh
grouping.
you
see
a
full
range
of
all
of
the
prices
for
1957
and
1958
contracts.
the
lowest
price,
absolute
lowest
price
were
14
cents.
now,
i
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
14
cents.
i
want
to
mention
at
this
point,
all
of
these
prices
are
exclusive
of
tax
reimbursement.
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
alright
sir,
as
the
overall
figure,
the
median
price
--
well,
let
me
go
to
this.
alright,
the
median
price
was
in
1957,
20.3
and
19
cents.
now
that
would
be
equated
to
18.5
cents.
the
highest
25%
was
21.3
and
22
cents
and
though,
if
you
wanted
to
equate
them
and
now
you've
got
me
because
i
don't
know
how
you're
going
to
determine
what
the
proper
tax
reimbursement
ought
to
be
although
as
i
pointed
out.
dr.
foster
on
the
preceding
schedule
which
is
found
on
the
--
page
296
of
the
record
does
show
that
the
average
of
the
tax
reimbursement
would
be
2.1
cents.
therefore,
if
you
look
at
those
prices,
it
would
be
23.4
and
24.1
considering
tax
reimbursement
in
there.
now,
if
you
looked
at
the
median
price
and
i
must
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
no,
sir.
but
it's
considerably
off
from
the
18.5
cents
and
i
mentioned
in
my
brief
that
while
--
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
yes,
your
honor.
it
certainly
does,
but
when?
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
sir?
mr.
herbert
w.
varner
yes,
your
honor.
but
think
of
the
predicament
in
which
the
producer
faces
or
finds
himself
in
this
instance.
in
1959,
he
had
what
he
thought
was
a
permanent
certificate
in
one
of
superior's
cases,
at
23.8
cents,
in
another
case,
at
21.4.
the
difference
is,
one
is
an
offshore
sale,
one
is
an
onshore
sale.
offshore,
the
tax
reimbursement
just
doesn't
exist
and
that's
why
the
price
is
low.
we
commence
deliveries
under
that
permanent
certificate,
we
thought.
it
was
we
knew,
subject
to
judicial
review.
we
also
knew
that
section
19
(c)
of
the
act
provides
that
not
withstanding
review
either
at
the
hands
of
the
commission
or
of
the
courts,
the
orders
of
the
commission
shall
be
effective.
now
i
must
confess,
i've
never
been
able
to
understand
how
general
counsel
can
say
under
those
circumstances
we
started
with
any
risk.
now,
he
did
say
that
of
course
we
were
legally
entitled
to
start
and
so
we
were.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
were
compelled
to
start.
the
certificating
orders
required
that
they'd
be
accepted
or
rejected
within
30
days.
now
bear
in
mind,
this
is
after
a
contested
hearing
in
both
cases.
the
commission
has
determined
that
the
public
interest
now
require
this
side.
they
have
said,
“you
must
accept
it
or
reject
it
in
30
days.”
now,
we
had
a
contract
and
i
would
refer
you
to
the
record
at
page
164
and
the
contract
provides
in
general
terms,
this
happens
to
be
the
united
contract,
that
it
recognizes
neither
party
can
commence
service
until
we've
been
certificated.
but
then
it
says,
notwithstanding
all
the
provisions
for
sale
and
delivery
neither
sale
in
a
bar
shall
be
obligated
to
accept
any
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
authorizing
the
sale
of
purchase
of
gas,
your
honor,
in
any
field
covered
hereby
which
certificate
contains
conditions
which
are
not
acceptable
to
the
party
to
whom
such
if
it
is
issued.
we
had
a
totally
unconditioned
except
the
way
they
accept
it
or
reject
it
(inaudible)
--
the
certificate.
we
had
to
accept
or
reject
and
under
the
contract,
we
couldn't
very
well
reject
because
it
was
satisfied.
and
under
the
order,
we
had
to
do
something
before
the
time
for
judicial
review;
petition
for
judicial
review
would
even
expire.
now
over
and
above
these
contract
situations,
i
think
the
court
is
well
aware
that
in
the
oil
and
gas
industry
you
cannot
for
too
long
fail
to
sell
gas
if
you've
got
--
if
you
have
gas.
in
other
words,
as
in
oil
and
gas,
let's
say
you
have
an
obligation
to
market.
that
obligation
has
to
be
carried
out.
now
you
in
many
cases
have
some
relief
on
you
at
least
where
there
is
no
available
market.
but
i've
never
seen
the
issue
tried
where
i've
been
very
hesitant
of
the
outcome
from
the
oil
company's
point
of
view,
if
you
have
the
market
and
say,
“no,
i
just
want
to
take
it”.
now,
it's
been
argued
by
counsel
on
the
other
side
that
by
commencing
this
service,
we
took
the
risk.
i
don't
think
we
took
any
risk.
we
took
action
we
were
legally
entitled
to
take
as
the
commission's
general
counsel
recognizes.
we
took
actions
which
the
respondents
--
i
mean,
excuse
me,
the
petitioners
could
have
stopped
and
they
so
stays
and
they
didn't
do
it.
but
over
it,
over
and
above
that,
if
you
assume
that
we
have
some
risk,
we
surely
didn't
take
the
risk
of
confiscation.
and
confiscation
is
exactly
what
we've
been
vested
with.
now,
the
evidence
here
was
all
rejected
i
concede
but
not
the
same
token
by
that
very
rejection
that
evidence
must
be
taken
as
proof
what
it
purports
to
show.
it
has
not
been
cross-examined,
i
concede.
but
nevertheless,
if
the
evidence
i
tend
now
is
to
be
rejected,
then
it
must
be
because
the
parties
concede
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
how
good
it
is,
how
weighed
it
is,
how
well
prepared
it
is,
it's
still
irrelevant.
and
that
is
a
matter
of
fact
is
exactly
what
the
commission
held.
now,
i
believe
counsel
for
ugi
in
his
“narrow
ground”
for
reversing
the
court
below
said
that
this
evidence
weren't
prepared
exactly
in
the
commission
format.
i
respectfully
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
decision
on
the
court
below
saying
that
it
was
in
fact
and
that
evidence
showed
that
the
unit
cost
of
these
respondents
exceeded
their
contract
prices.
and
yet,
the
commission
is
reducing
those
contract
prices.
now,
mind
you,
i'm
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
if
i
contract
for
less
of
my
cost
and
i
might
assure
you
that
all
of
these
contracts
were
made,
negotiated
and
bargained
for
without
any
knowledge
of
cost.
we
just
didn't
know.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
didn't
care,
and
why,
because
we
had
to
take
what
we
could
get
at
the
market
at
the
hands
of
the
pipeline.
we
couldn't
get
any
more
than
that.
and
we
took
these
prices
as
we
had
taken
much
lower
prices
earlier
because
again,
that's
all
we
could
get.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
the
in-line
price
is,
what
the
guideline
price
is,
what
any
price
is.
the
producer
of
gas
will
never
in
this
world
get
more
than
the
pipeline
fields
that
the
market
requires
and
that's
the
reason
going
back
to
hunt.
your
first
item
mentioned
there
was,
adequacy
of
gas
reserves.
no
pipeline
is
going
to
buy
my
gas
at
25
cents.
if
they
can
buy
my
neighbor's
gas
at
23
cents,
22
cents,
21
cents
or
any
lesser
figure
than
i'm
willing
to
sell
it
for.
your
honors,
i
see
i've
had
my
time.
thank
you.
