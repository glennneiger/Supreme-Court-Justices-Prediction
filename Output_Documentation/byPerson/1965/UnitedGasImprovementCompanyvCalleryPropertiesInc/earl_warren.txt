mr.
attwell,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
the
first
point
at
which
you
could've
taken
--
could've
noted
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
government
--
doesn't
the
government
contend
that
it
had
all
that
it'd
taken
the
evidence,
this
economic
evidence
in
other
proceedings
of
a
--
of
similar
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
--
would
you
respond
to
that
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
wouldn't
that
go
to
the
decision
of
whether
the
administrative
process
would
break
down
if
they
had
to
repeat
all
of
this
voluminous
testimony
as
to
the
economic
factors
in
every
single
case
that
comes
along
if
they
--
if
they're
already
apprised
of
the
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
offer
to
supplement
the
testimony
they
had
taken
in
other
cases
by
bringing
it
up
to
--
just
bringing
it
up
to
date
or
did
you
offered
to
the
entire
amount
of
economic
evidence
as
you
--
that
you
have
available?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.

continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we're
getting
into
a
lot
of
ancillary
matters
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
so
i
think
we'd
better
ask
counsel
on
the
other
side
when
he
stands
up
what
he
thinks
about
that
and
whether
it's
fair
to
go
into
that
at
this
time.
i
really
don't
know
myself
but
we'll
see.
i'll
ask
him
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
your
observation
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
no
objection,
you
may
do
it.
