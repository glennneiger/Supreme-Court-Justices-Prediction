justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
the
initial
certification
that
you're
offering
in
--
supporting
documents
when
you
filed
relief?
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
all
that
was
before
the
commission.
justice
tom
c.
clark
did
you
raise
the
point
(inaudible)
i
think
mr.
coleman
raised
that
point
(inaudible)
is
that
his
point?
justice
tom
c.
clark
could
i
ask
you
one
more
question
before
you
sit
down
now.
as
i
understand
if
the
--
this
in-line
price
is
somewhat
of
a
stop
gap
you
might
say?
i'm
speaking
now
from
the
commissions
you
pointed.
there's
so
many
of
these
things,
it
takes
so
long
to
hear
them
and
everything
where
the
commission
says,
“well,
why
don't
we
have
a
stop
gap
and
so
we'll
put
in
an
in-line
price.”
and
then
we'll
hear
everybody
and
decide
on
a
just
and
reasonable
price.
is
that
right?
justice
tom
c.
clark
now
when
you
--
after
you
get
all
the
hurdle
of
this
initial
in-line
price
and
you're
now
before
the
commission
will
say,
you
could
put
in
any
evidence
you
thought
relevant
and
make
it
here,
any
or
other,
any
evidence
that
they
thought
relevant?
is
that
it
or
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes.
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
would
they
receive
in
this
june
1967
proceeding,
the
one
that
counsel
said
they
had
a
deadline?
justice
tom
c.
clark
if
that
--
the
evidence
–-
would
that
proceeding
have.
justice
tom
c.
clark
then
the
(voice
overlap)
is
going
on
now
that's
going
to
be
concluded
at
this
date,
this
deadline?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
courts
already
approved
then,
that's
what
i
understand
you
make
here.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
thought
that
was
going
on
now?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
understand
and
that's
what
i
was
talking
about
in
that
proceeding
which
is
going
on
now
you
say
a
--
you
can
introduce
all
these
documents
that
you
offered.
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
can
offer
them.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
that
whole
question
has
come
up
in
that
case
too,
isn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
can
escalate
at
the
23.55
increase.
justice
tom
c.
clark
during
the
seven
years
you
could,
couldn't
you?
justice
tom
c.
clark
no,
what
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
the
past,
i
mean
you
could
go
up
to
a
maximum
of
23.55.
justice
tom
c.
clark
have
you
filed
any
increases?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
medium
is
1.73,
you
said.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i'm
sorry.
justice
tom
c.
clark
would
you
have
us
to
take
all
these
contracts
and
add
them
up
and
see
what
would
came
out?
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
where
you
raised
the
issue
on
refunds,
full
admission?
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
that
a
copy
of
your
petition
for
rehearing?
justice
tom
c.
clark
before
the
commission?
justice
tom
c.
clark
maybe
you
could
lodge
it
to
the
clerk.
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
that
so,
be
inclined.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
understand.
that's
why
i
thought
perhaps,
(inaudible)
as
to
the
clerk.
justice
tom
c.
clark
oh,
i
just
--
and
i
--
i
admit
to
find
that
counsel,
i
think
mr.
edward
said
that
they've
raised
it
and
i
was
going
to
look
it
at
night
to
see
where
it
was
and
i
thought
maybe
you
might
save
me
the
trouble
with
these
records?
justice
tom
c.
clark
thank
you.
justice
tom
c.
clark
all
have
been
(inaudible)
charged
is
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
primarily
above
that,
i
understand.
justice
tom
c.
clark
why?
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
(inaudible)
--
i
thought
they
gave
it.
