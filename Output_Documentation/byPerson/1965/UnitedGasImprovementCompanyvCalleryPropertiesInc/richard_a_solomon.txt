mr.
richard
a.
solomon
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
these
cases
are
here
on
certiorari
from
a
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
in
three
separate
respects
has
invalidated
the
established
procedure
and
practices
of
the
commission
in
issuing
certificates
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
natural
gas
producers.
these
policies
which
were
invalidated
were
in
turn
developed
and
adopted
by
the
commission
in
order
to
afford
consumers
the
adequate
protection
from
spiraling
prices
during
the
period
required
to
determine
just
and
reasonable
prices
and
of
course
this
was
done
at
the
directive
of
this
court
in
what
i
will
refer
to
as
the
catco
case
but
which
goes
under
the
official
style
of
atlantic
refining
company
versus
public
service
commission
and
appears
in
volume
360
--
starting
page
378.
now,
as
the
court
will
remember
the
problem
arises
because
of
the
necessary
considerable
period
of
time
it
takes
to
determine
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
under
which
natural
gas
is
to
be
sold
by
producers
in
the
field
to
interstate
pipelines.
in
the
meantime
the
court
said
in
catco,
the
commission
must
take
appropriate
action
under
its
certificate
powers
under
section
7
of
the
act
to
prevent
a
runaway
price
bargain.
i'm
pleased
to
advise
this
court
that
since
this
matter
was
last
before
you,
there
has
been
a
very
great
deal
of
progress
in
the
area
rate
program
itself.
the
commission
has
decided
and
is
now
in
the
courts,
lower
courts
of
course,
the
first
major
area
price
decision
which
involves
the
permian
basin.
the
second
major
case
which
involves
the
southern
louisiana
area
where
these
particular
cases
happen
to
arise
is
in
its
final
--
certainly
months
and
i
think
almost
days
of
hearing
before
the
examiner
and
two
other
cases
which
when
combined
with
the
other
two
will
account
for
approximately
3
quarters
of
all
the
gas
moving
in
interstate
commerce
have
been
started
and
are
well
on
their
way.
but
the
fact
that
we
have
this
progress
does
not
mean
that
the
interim
problem
which
this
court
dealt
with
in
catco
has
ceased
to
be
important.
progress
yes,
but
we're
not
at
the
end
of
this
line
of
fixing
just
and
reasonable
prices
by
any
means
and
its
--
remains
today
just
as
before
important
that
the
commission
perform
the
function
that
the
court
told
it
to
perform.
now
what
the
commission
has
done
and
what
the
lower
court
has
told
us
we
cannot
do
is
two
things.
in
the
first
place
we
said
natural
gas
may
not
enter
the
interstate
market
except
at
an
initial
starting
price
which
is
in
line
with
the
other
prices
paid
for
substantial
quantities
of
gas
at
the
same
periods
in
the
same
area.
leaving
aside
of
course
prices
which
are
themselves
suspect
because
they
were
in
litigation
at
the
time
or
subject
to
commission
review.
and
the
second
part
of
the
commission's
essential
package
for
holding
the
line
is
that
we
have
said
while
once
the
initial
price
is
set
you
may
normally
exercise
your
authority
to
file
for
contractually
authorized
rate
increases.
at
least
until
we
can
decide
the
area
rate
proceedings.
at
least
until
to
that
time
or
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
commission
has
added
to
that
a
further
definite
cutoff
but
at
least
for
a
limited
period.
you
may
not
file
a
rate
increase.
if
it
is
above
the
rate
which
the
commissioners
found
would
start
the
triggering
activity
with
respect
to
all
the
other
rates
in
the
area.
now
the
court
of
appeals
upset
both
of
these
determinations.
it
held
the
commission
couldn't
fix
the
initial
price
which
gas
could
enter
the
interstate
market
at
an
in
line
level
below
that
called
for
in
the
producer's
contracts
unless
we
first
considered
a
mass
of
material
which
had
been
presented
by
this
in
this
case
in
which
it
had
been
presented
in
a
number
of
other
cases
of
exactly
the
type
which
is
involved
in
the
area
rate
case
which
is
intended
to
show
individual
company
cost
and
group
cost
and
economic
trends
in
the
area
all
of
which
are
calculated
to
show
the
eventual
needs
for
a
just
and
reasonable
price
level
for
the
industry.
the
court
said
we
have
to
consider
all
of
that
information
in
the
certificate
proceeding
itself
before
we
can
say
you
can't
offer
it
--
you
can't
enter
the
market
at
an
in
line
rate.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right.
they
said
--
they
suggest
that
the
nature
of
the
consideration
maybe
different
but
the
weight
of
the
problem
is
the
same.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
exactly,
yes.
the
standard
presumably
would
be
public
interest
but
the
work
involved
would
be
the
same.
and
the
second
thing
the
court
held
was
that
under
the
statutory
scheme
the
commission
has
no
power
whatsoever
no
matter
valid
or
useful
or
valuable
the
reason
to
exercise
it's
conditioning
authority
under
section
7
of
the
act
to
prevent
even
for
a
short
time
anybody
from
filing
any
rate
if
they
have
a
contractual
authority
filed.
of
course
this
means
that
as
far
as
triggering
is
concerned
that
we
can
take
no
effective
action
because
it's
perfectly
clear
that
it
doesn't
do
any
good
to
set
a
lower
initial
price
if
the
producer
is
free
the
next
day
to
file
up
to
his
triggering
line.
in
addition
and
i'll
go
into
this
a
little
more
late
--
detail
later.
the
court
reversed
the
commission
on
a
refund
matter.
as
i
will
indicate
these
cases
are
up
before
the
commission
for
the
second
time
having
been
remanded
ones
because
we
had
an
improper
standard.
the
commission
held
that
there
should
be
refunds
ordered
for
the
high
prices,
the
two
high
prices
which
had
been
charged
during
this
intermediate
period.
the
court
agreed
with
us
that
this
is
a
situation
where
refunds
are
called
for
but
they
adopted
a
different
standard
of
refunds
and
either
i
will
get
into
that
later
or
my
associates
will,
because
we
think
they
erred
there
too.
now
let
me
briefly
sketch
the
background
facts
in
this
case.
these
cases
are
almost
contemporary
with
catco.
this
of
course
is
not
surprising
they've
been
up
and
down
the
courts
two
or
three
times.
and
they
are
as
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
know
infected
with
the
error
that
the
commission
originally
made
in
catco.
the
--
there
are
a
number
of
consolidated
sales
but
they
fall
into
two
groups.
the
--
they
were
all
made
by
the
way
and
this
is
critical,
all
of
these
sales
were
originally
made
under
contracts
in
1957
and
1958
and
they
all
involved
sales
in
the
southern
louisiana
area.
catco
involved
sales
in
the
southern
louisiana
area
but
it
was
a
sale
in
1956.
now
the
first
of
these
sales
were
certificated
by
the
commission
in
september
1958
and
they
were
certificated
at
prices
that
ranged
from
22.4
to
23.3
or
8
cents
per
mcf.
this
was
a
price
which
was
a
cent
and
a
half
to
a
cent
higher
than
the
catco
price
which
was
then
in
the
courts.
and
it
was
a
price
which
the
commission
decision
admitted
could
trigger
at
least
half
a
million
dollars
of
increases
in
the
pipelines
rates.
this
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
third
circuit.
it
was
appealed
to
this
court
and
this
court
without
even
having
oral
argument
summarily
reversed
and
sent
it
back
to
the
commission
to
consider
in
the
light
of
the
catco
decision
and
that
is
an
opinion
appearing
at
361
u.s.,
public
service
commission
of
new
york
versus
the
fpc.
now
in
the
meantime
these
other
applications
were
before
the
commission
and
they
were
originally
also
granted
without
any
price
condition
although
their
prices
were
also
in
this
21
to
23
cent
range.
but
they
were
decided
on
august
10th,
1959,
a
week
after
the
third
circuit's
opinion
in
the
earlier
case
which
is
i
said
was
subsequently
reversed
here.
and
since
these
decisions
were
post-catco
cases
the
commission
did
purport
to
follow
the
catco
rule.
but
in
each
case
in
determining
that
these
sales
were
in
line
what
it
did
was
say
they
were
in
line
because
they
were
no
higher
than
the
sales
involved
in
catco
or
in
the
public
service
case
and
therefore
were
in
line.
these
cases
were
in
due
course
appealed
to
the
courts
and
then
a
series
of
opinions
by
a
number
of
courts
of
appeals,
each
and
everyone
of
them
was
reversed
on
the
ground
that
in
attempting
to
determine
the
proper
initial
price
line
it
was
improper
for
the
commission
to
rely
upon
the
catco
and
public
service
sales
which
were
themselves
in
issue
in
the
courts
at
that
time.
and
the
court
went
on
in
both
the
ninth
circuit
case
which
i'll
quote
from
and
this
was
proved
in
the
other
court
to
say
that
not
only
couldn't
the
commission
determining
a
line
pass
upon
the
fails
which
were
in
court
but
where
a
substantial
number
of
certificated
prices
or
thus
under
court
or
commission
review.
like
prices
from
the
same
area
though
not
currently
under
review
ought
to
be
regarded
a
suspect
ought
to
be
looked
into
to
see
whether
they
weren't
affected
by
the
same
vice.
the
producers
involved
in
this
case
had
all
been
operating
under
their
invalidated
certificates
throughout
the
course
of
the
court
litigation.
they've
done
so
of
course
with
full
knowledge
of
litigation
and
they
done
so
perfectly
legally
since
they
were
authorized
to
operate
by
the
commission.
when
the
cases
were
remanded
to
the
commission,
the
question
came
up
as
to
how
these
should
be
handled
during
the
interim
acquired
for
further
commission
review.
in
the
catco
case
itself
and
a
number
of
other
cases
which
have
been
remanded
the
commission
had
actually
set
aside
the
original
certificates
and
issued
new
temporary
certificates
with
refund
obligations.
the
commission
here
said
this
was
unnecessary
that
our
normal
powers
were
more
than
adequate
to
allow
them
to
continue
to
operate
on
the
old
certificate
but
the
commission
made
clear
that
of
course
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case
they
would
be
obligated
to
pay
such
refunds
as
it
might
turn
out
to
be
appropriate
in
the
light
of
what
the
proper
certificate
price
was.
the
hearing
was
held
in
1962.
the
remanded
hearing
of
these
consolidated
proceedings.
by
that
time
the
commission
had
had
considerable
experience
in
producer
certificate
cases
under
the
standards
established
by
catco
as
elaborated
by
the
civil
courts
of
appeals
and
the
commission
had
decided
as
a
matter
of
general
policy
that
it
would
fix
the
initial
price
and
i'll
explain
what
that
is
in
a
few
minutes,
in
order
to
fix
the
initial
price
at
the
in
line
level
which
as
i
indicated
as
the
courts
of
appeals
had
indicated
was
the
price
at
which
substantial
amounts
of
gas
in
the
area
were
contemporaneously
flowing
under
other
contracts,
contracts
which
were
not
involved
in
litigation
or
not
affected
by
the
sales
which
are
involved
in
litigation.
now
in
a
number
of
the
earlier
preceding
that
preceded
this
one,
the
commission
had
permitted
producers
to
submit
evidence
of
their
cost
or
industry
cost
of
economic
trend
and
without
exception
the
commission
had
filed
as
it
evolved
this
in
line
price
document.
this
evidence
was
of
no
value
to
them
that
it
was
not
persuasive.
and
in
and
of
itself
it
usually
was
no
good
and
that
anyway
it
was
simply
delaying
the
entire
proceeding.
but
the
commission
had
expressly
held
that
in
the
earlier
skelly
case
and
it's
determination
on
that
point
was
subsequently
affirmed
by
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
in
this
case
when
similar
evidence
was
introduced
it
was
rejected
by
the
examiner,
officer
proofer
made
but
there
was
no
cross-examinations,
no
rebuttal
made
on
it,
was
rejected
by
the
examiner
and
the
commission
expressly
affirmed
this
rejection.
as
to
the
in
line
price
itself
the
commission
held
that
there
was
a
considerable
amount
of
gas
that
was
flowing
at
the
either
18
and
a
half
cents
or
below
in
this
area
that
all
of
the
prices
in
1957
and
1958
which
were
higher
than
that
were
as
the
testimony
indicated,
the
direct
result
of
the
new
plateau
which
had
been
set
in
catco
and
the
public
service
case.
and
that
no
showing
had
been
made
that
any
of
these
higher
prices
were
not
this
result
of
catco
and
that
therefore
anything
higher
than
18
and
a
half
cents
or
20
cents,
it
--
there
was
a
tax
problem,
would
be
out
of
line
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
the
commission
affirmed
us
but
the
commission
did
one
more
thing.
the
commission
held
that
not
only
was
the
proper
in
line
starting
point
18
and
a
half
cents
or
20
cents,
let
me
explain
that
briefly.
some
of
this
gas
is
sold
from
offshore
areas
where
the
state
taxing
authority
does
not
apply.
some
of
it
is
sold
within
the
taxing
authority
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
the
difference
between
18
and
a
half
and
20
cents
which
you
may
sometimes
hear
during
the
course
of
this
argument
reflects
that.
the
commission
said
this
is
the
proper
starting
place
and
you
may
file
increases
above
that
starting
place
to
the
extent
that
your
contracts
permit
subject
to
the
suspension
provisions
and
refund
provisions
of
section
4
of
the
act.
but
until
we
complete
the
southern
louisiana
rate
case
or
until
july
1st
1967,
whichever
is
earlier,
this
latter
date
was
picked
merely
to
give
a
firm
idea
that
what
the
outside
limit
of
this
particular
moratorium
would
be.
until
that
time
you
cannot
file
for
a
rate
more
than
23.55
cents
which
was
the
rate
the
commission
found
anything
above
that
would
be
likely
to
endanger
triggering
the
type
this
court
is
familiar
with
as
a
result
of
favored
nation
clauses,
from
redetermination
clauses
and
all
this
paraphernalia
of
contract
provisions
which
has
been
outlawed
as
of
1962
but
which
exist
in
many,
many
contracts
which
have
been
certificated
prior
to
that
date.
the
essential
issue
presented
by
the
case
then
is
the
validity
of
these
techniques
for
complying
with
the
court's
mandate
in
catco.
this
mandate
was
that
we
must
if
we
are
going
to
consider
granting
certificates
to
producers
we
must
afford
consumers
a
complete,
permanent
and
effective
bond
of
protection
from
excessive
rates
and
charges
by
using
our
conditioning
authority
under
section
7
of
the
act.
the
problem
arises
as
i
said
before
because
in
the
absence
of
these
conditions
a
sale
certificated
at
a
price
which
turns
out
to
have
been
too
high
when
you
test
it
by
the
just
and
reasonable
standard
can
be
corrected
only
prospectively
and
the
consumers
are
left
holding
a
bag
during
this
not
too
short
interim
period.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no.
it
was
an
outside
date
that
the
commission
picked.
i
think
i'd
have
to
figure
it
out,
it
was
two
years
or
a
year
and
a
half
or
three
years
from
the
date
they
were
issuing
this
order.
it's
simply
an
outer
limit.
all
indications
are
that
the
area
rate
proceeding,
the
goal
i
understand
is
to
complete
the
hearings
by
the
first
of
next
month
in
their
--
the
examiners'
opinion
of
the
commission
decision
with
the
guidelines
of
the
first
area
proceeding,
july
1,
1967
should
be
a
date
which
will
have
no
real
significance.
the
real
date
is
going
to
be
the
date
of
the
proceeding.
but
the
commission
in
each
case
were
given
extra
degree
of
definiteness
has
set
an
outside
date.
now,
as
i
indicated
what
the
commission
has
done
to
afford
interim
protection
from
too
high
prices
and
to
prevent
the
very
real
effect
of
high
prices
in
triggering
price
increases
or
in
establishing
new
plateaus
is
the
simple
two
part
condition.
it
said
until
we
can
set
the
just
and
reasonable
price
level
which
of
course
will
then
be
the
guidepost
for
certification
until
we
can
do
this
we
will
not
normally
allow
you
to
enter
the
market
at
an
initial
price
higher
than
the
in
line
price
which
are
described.
this
initial
price,
this
in
line
price
which
the
commission
sets
is
a
firm
price
and
this
is
important
from
the
standpoint
of
the
producer
and
of
course
the
standpoint
of
the
consumer
as
well.
it's
a
firm
price
in
the
sense
that
it
can
be
modified
by
the
commission
only
prospectively
in
a
section
5
rate
proceeding.
and
even
if
such
proceeding
should
determine
that
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
the
gas
is
lower
than
the
in
line
price
there
will
be
no
refunds
from
that.
this
is
why
justice
white
said
that
if
the
commission
errs
in
setting
this
in
line
price
it
should
do
so
on
the
lower
side
rather
than
the
higher
side.
but
the
in
line
price
and
i
want
to
stress
this,
in
line
price
is
not
firm
in
the
sense
that
it
deprives
producers
of
a
right
if
they
choose
to
seek
a
higher
price.
they
remain
free
within
the
limits
of
their
contractual
authorization
and
the
triggering
moratorium
to
file
for
a
higher
price
if
they
choose
to
do
so
of
course.
the
increased
rate
will
be
suspended
and
can
be
put
into
effect
after
the
suspension
period
only
subject
to
refund.
i
stress
that
the
initial
price
is
only
a
starting
price
because
i
think
it
conceivably
might
be
relevant
to
the
issue
of
how
much
evidence
we
have
to
allow
in
the
record
before
we
can
set
the
initial
price.
i
can
conceive
of
circumstances
in
which
the
commission
might
think
for
some
reason
or
other
than
the
public
interest
required
that
there'd
be
a
firm
price
either
permanently
or
for
an
extended
period
of
time
which
couldn't
be
raised.
and
i
can
conceive
that
under
such
circumstances
the
evidentiary
standards
of
what
evidence
has
to
be
allowed
into
the
record
before
we
could
make
such
a
determination
might
be
different,
may
be
things
which
we
think
are
irrelevant,
immaterial
and
extremely
burdensome
to
the
type
of
decision
we're
making
here
conceivably
might
be
relevant
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes
sir,
i'll
get
to
that
in
a
minute.
but
here,
i
want
to
--
before
i
do,
let
me
stress
again
that
the
question
is
solely
whether
we
can
conclude
that
any
sales
above
the
in
line
price,
the
going
rate
must
be
at
the
producer's
risk
if
it
turns
out
on
analysis
to
have
been
too
high.
and
whether
there's
a
necessary
corollary
it
can
conclude
that
all
evidence
irrelevant
to
this
in
line
determination
should
be
rejected
at
the
threshold.
putting
it
another
way,
may
a
producer
insist
and
this
is
what
their
case
comes
down
to,
may
they
insist
on
the
right
to
introduce
masses
of
cost
and
economic
evidence
which
arguably
might
be
relevant
in
fixing
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
pending
the
determination
of
just
and
reasonable
rates,
they
should
be
able
to
operate
at
a
risk
free
level
higher
than
the
going
rate
in
the
area.
now,
let
me
get
to
commissioner
harlan's
question
this
time,
to
go
back
to
where
i
was
going
to
go
to.
i
want
to
make
clear
that
the
commission
in
excluding
the
cost
of
service
evidence
here
including
--
its
excluding
its
economic
trend
outs
has
not
precluded
the
producers
from
making
any
showing
in
support
of
their
contentions
that
sales
should
be
certificated
in
southern
louisiana
in
1957
and
1958
and
higher
than
the
1956
catco
prices.
on
the
contrary,
it
permitted
a
full
showing
as
to
the
extended
nature
of
the
sales
during
the
1957
and
1958
period
involved
permit
a
showing
to
made
if
it
could
be.
but
the
general
price
line
in
these
later
years
unaffected
by
the
catco
errors
was
higher.
and
also
it
was
perfectly
free
and
they
were
perfectly
free
and
able
to
make
a
showing
that
for
some
reason
the
nature
of
their
gas
or
the
services
they
were
providing
was
such
that
a
higher
than
the
normal
in
line
rate
was
warranted
in
their
particular
sale.
no
such
showing
was
made
in
this
case
but
the
fact
that
no
such
showing
was
made
here
does
not
prove
that
they
didn't
really
have
an
opportunity
to
do
so.
the
commission
since
held
in
a
subsequent
case
which
of
course
is
not
before
this
court
that
the
general
in
line
level
in
southern
louisiana
has
actually
remained
constant
at
least
in
1962.
but
it
has
not
held
that
in
all
--
in
certificate
cases
that
it
held.
on
the
contrary
in
a
number
of
other
areas
on
the
basis
of
appropriate
evidence,
it
is
found
that
the
in
line
price
is
somewhat
higher
in
the
later
periods
than
in
the
earlier
periods
and
this
could've
been
shown
here
if
the
facts
would
have
warranted
it.
similarly
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
if
the
facts
warranted
it.
the
facts
was
there
were
some
higher
prices
in
1957
and
1958
than
the
in
line
price
and
the
facts
were
the
testimony
by
the
pipeline
were
that
we
had
paid
these
prices
because
a
new
catco
level
had
come
in
and
we
couldn't
get
gas
cheaper.
and
now
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
which
had
not
yet
been
corrected,
that's
right,
yes.
similarly
there
have
been
occasions.
i
don't
mean
to
overdo
this.
normally
the
commission's
policy
is
to
certificate
at
the
in
line
price
and
i
do
not
apologize
for
that.
but
there
have
been
occasions
upon
which
the
commission
has
certificated
a
particular
sale
higher
than
the
in
line
price
in
the
particular
area
at
that
time.
in
fact,
within
the
last
year
one
of
the
affiliates
to
some
of
the
respondents
in
this
very
case
was
given
an
initial
in
line
prize
for
a
sale
in
southern
louisiana
which
was
higher
than
the
in
line
price
which
we
were
certificating
in
southern
louisiana.
there
was
a
good
reason
for
it,
because
the
reason
he
was
able
to
get
that
higher
price
was
he
showed
that
unlike
the
normal
situation
in
southern
louisiana,
he
was
transporting
the
gas
from
offshore
--
onshore
to
a
pipeline
for
about
40
or
50
miles.
and
in
that
circumstance
the
commission
said,
"yes,
you've
shown
that
in
this
particular
circumstance
there's
some
justification
for
more
than
an
in
line
prize."
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
sir.
now,
this
court
in
the
catco
decision
and
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
in
a
number
of
the
decisions
reversing
these
cases
other
have
indicated
or
written
their
language
saying
that
the
commission
cannot
certificate
sales
at
an
out
of
line
price
in
the
absence
of
a
strong
evidentiary
showing
that
the
public
interest
so
requires.
this
language
is
urged
--
demonstrates
that
the
commission
must
allow
the
producers
to
make
any
showing
of
this
cost
nature
that
they
want,
must
allow
that
before
it
can
certificate
the
gas
at
an
in
line
price
but
this
doesn't
follow.
its
one
thing
to
say
that
the
commission
in
order
to
perform
the
essential
function
of
the
act
of
protecting
consumers
cannot
allow
prices
to
escalate
without
a
complete
showing
of
the
absolute
requirements
of
the
public
interest
for
that.
it's
something
else
again
to
say
that
the
commission
cannot
establish
a
policy
such
as
it
is
done
and
such
as
it
is
done
previous
to
catco
as
well.
i'm
saying
the
way
we're
going
to
handle
this
interim
problem
is
allow
you
to
come
in
to
the
market
at
a
going
rate
and
then
escalate
up
within
triggering
limitations
at
your
own
risk.
and
for
this
type
of
a
determination
by
the
commission,
we
suggest
that
the
commission
properly
can
say
it
will
not
consider
evidence
of
the
cost
and
economic
nature
and
need
not
as
this
court
stressed
in
catco,
need
not
in
fact
convert
the
certificate
cases
into
just
and
reasonable
cases,
not
converting
it
in
the
standpoint
of
standards
but
converting
it
in
the
equally
critical
standpoint
of
the
amount
of
work
and
time
that
has
to
be
done.
because
if
it's
going
to
take
us
just
as
long
it's
going
to
take
us
just
as
long
to
try
and
determine
the
certificate
matter
as
it
does
to
try
and
determine
the
just
and
reasonable
price
for
this
gas,
if
we're
going
to
have
to
consider
all
the
general
economic
evidence
and
if
as
a
matter
of
fact
we're
going
to
have
to
consider
as
the
lower
court
said
we
did
and
now
as
these
respondents
argue.
15
or
16
individual
company
costs
to
service
cases
as
well.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
certificate
procedure
that
mr.
justice
clark's
opinion
in
catco
envisioned
as
performing
this
interim
function
is
not
going
to
perform
it
at
all.
and
this
of
course
exactly
what
the
lower
court's
opinion
would
require.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
catco
--
that
was
the
whole
problem
with
catco.
if
catco
was
a
temporary
certificate
--
situation
might
have
been
different
but
catco
was
a
permanent
certificate
issued
after
a
full
hearing
and
--
well,
it's
temporary
in
the
sense
that
any
permanent
certificate
is
subject
to
being
changed
prospectively
in
a
section
5
(a)
proceeding
but
there
was
nothing
else
temporary
about
catco.
the
producers
contend
in
their
briefs
that
the
burden
upon
the
commission
in
considering
this
cost
and
economic
data
will
not
really
be
too
great
since
most
producers
have
indicated
a
willingness
to
accept
certification
of
the
in
line
price
and
even
to
accept
the
commission's
guidelines
as
to
what
the
price
should
be.
but
even
if
we
assume
that
95%
of
the
producers
would
continue
to
accept
the
in
line
test
if
these
respondents
were
to
prevail
in
this
court
it's
clear
that
the
time
that
would
have
to
be
devoted
to
considering
a
cost
(inaudible)
--
economic
data
of
these
hardcore
cases
would
still
be
inordinate.
thus
the
excluded
testimony
presented
in
support
of
just
the
13
applications
which
went
to
hearing
here
from
out
to
some
2000
pages
of
record
without
cross-examination
or
rebuttal
and
in
seven
other
proceedings
in
which
evidence
of
this
nature
has
been
introduced
and
rejected.
the
seven
cases
mentioned
in
mr.
coleman's
brief,
i
count
it
up
and
found
out
that
there
were
no
less
than
532
separate
applications
involved.
this
problem
doesn't
only
concern
in
other
words,
these
8
people
dealing
with
a
1957
-
1958
situation
it
concerns
the
basic
commission
certificated
findings
for
southern
louisiana
for
the
three
critical
texas
districts,
for
wyoming,
for
arizona
and
for
oklahoma
and
for
mississippi.
finally,
a
number
of
the
respondents
seem
to
suggest
that
while
as
an
original
matter
the
commission
might
have
had
authority
to
certificate
--
to
issue
certificates
conditions
to
an
initial
prize
of
the
in
line
level
which
they
could
then
accept
or
reject.
but
the
situation
is
somehow
different
here.
now,
this
argument
as
i
understand
it
goes
as
follows.
you
granted
us
an
original
certificate.
now
we
as
was
our
right
commenced
operation
pursuant
to
this
--
certificate
it
and
when
we
commenced
operation
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
section
7
(b)
of
the
act
we
could
not
terminate,
we
could
not
abandon
service
thereafter
without
permission
from
the
commission.
therefore
the
argument
goes
we
don't
have
the
option
that
somebody
would
initially
and
it
isn't
fair
to
apply
the
normal
standards
to
us
that
you
might
otherwise
apply.
i
point
out
--
and
i
point
out
not
in
passing
because
this
is
significant
that
this
distinction
is
not
the
distinction
of
the
lower
court
made.
the
lower
court's
opinion
is
equally
applicable
to
an
initial
certification
situation
as
to
one
on
remand.
but
let
me
go
on
to
say
that
the
argument
in
my
opinion
was
clearly
without
merit.
when
the
producers
commenced
service
in
1958
to
1959
they
were
well
aware
they
couldn't
thereafter
abandon
service
without
commission
approval
and
that
the
commission
authorization
was
being
contested
and
contested
vigorously
on
the
very
price
issue
by
the
consumer
interest
who
are
my
fellow
petitioners
here.
at
any
chances
their
contracts
provided
expressly
authority
for
them
to
withhold
action
until
they
got
a
final
and
non-reviewable
award
from
the
commission.
it's
true
that
the
commission's
order
as
a
matter
of
routine
provided
they
were
supposed
to
start
action,
start
operation
within
a
given
period
but
of
course
in
view
of
the
appeals
which
were
filed
they
could
have
sought
an
extension
of
that
from
the
commission
which
would
have
granted
it.
but
they
cannot
do
at
least
what
we
believe
was
clear
they
cannot
do
is
to
voluntarily
elect
to
commence
service
when
the
matter
is
still
under
court
review
and
then
when
the
commission
action
is
set
aside
for
failure
to
apply
appropriate
standards,
claim
that
these
standards
should
not
be
applied
to
them
because
they
started
operation.
they
can
contend
--
they
can
commence
operation
if
they
wish
but
obviously
it
has
to
be
at
their
own
risk.
this
is
no
minor
matter.
this
is
not
merely
confined
to
the
particular
situation
we're
faced
here
today
of
cases
which
were
remanded
five
years
ago.
on
the
contrary
as
this
court
has
recognized
a
number
of
cases
due
to
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
gas
production
industry
almost
every
contested
certificate
proceeding
will
necessarily
arise
in
the
context
of
producers
who
already
commenced
operation
and
due
to
such
considerations
the
drainage
from
adjoining
wells
or
flaring
or
shot
in
royalties,
etcetera,
producers
of
natural
gas
were
seldom
able
to
await
the
conclusion
of
the
contested
proceeding
and
they
seek
and
get
temporary
authorizations.
but
ones
they
got
a
temporary
authorization,
section
7
(b)
of
our
act
similarly
applies
and
they
similarly
cannot
abandon
without
our
authority.
accordingly
and
this
argument
that
they
have
started
and
therefore
different
standards
apply
really
means
that
we
cannot
apply
the
standards
that
catco
requires
us
to
apply
to
any
contested
proceeding.
we
cannot
give
this
effective
bond
of
protection
to
these
contested
proceedings
except
i
guess
by
thrusting
to
the
commission's
discretion
in
the
prices
that
might
set
in
temporary
authorizations.
i
don't
think
that
this
is
what
the
court
intended
to
establish
in
catco.
i
certainly
don't
think
this
is
what
my
friends
on
the
consumer
side
would
think
this
is
fair
to
them.
obviously
the
prices
we
would
set
in
guideline
prices
were
temporary
would
probably
much
--
be
much
closer
to
what
eventually
which
is
determined
as
the
in
line
price
than
the
producer
certificate
prices
involved
here.
but
as
my
associates
will
certainly
point
out
if
i
don't
in
significant
number
of
contested
cases
it
has
been
found
that
the
guideline
price
at
which
a
temporary
authorization
was
made
was
somewhat
higher
than
the
proper
in
line
price.
consequently,
if
we're
going
to
perform
any
useful
function
we
must
be
able
to
set
rates,
initial
rates,
starting
rates
at
an
in
line
price
and
we
must
be
able
to
do
so
in
the
context
of
a
proceeding
which
doesn't
have
to
consider
everything
we're
considering
at
the
same
time
in
a
just
and
reasonable
price
cases.
let
me
turn
briefly
to
the
second
part
of
this
commission
determination,
the
price
moratorium.
as
i
indicated
this
price
moratorium
permits
them
to
file
from
between
3
and
a
half
to
5
cents
above
the
in
line
price
but
says,
"until
we
finish
this
other
case
you
cannot
file
above
there."
now,
if
there's
one
thing
clear
in
this
court's
decision
in
catco
and
in
this
court's
more
recent
decision
in
hunt,
there's
one
thing
clear,
here
it
is,
that
we
were
instructed
to
take
whatever
action
is
necessary
to
effectively
prevent
triggering
of
these
high
spirals
while
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
were
being
set.
and
as
the
court
made
clear
in
the
hunt
case
which
of
course
of
all
temporary
certificates
a
year
or
so
ago,
this
is
not
adequately
taken
care
of
by
merely
allowing
the
high
rates
to
go
into
effect
subject
to
refund.
i
haven't
got
time
to
read
the
quotation.
it's
all
set
out
in
justice
clark's
opinion
that
obviously
that
is
not
adequate.
but
if
allowing
higher
rates
which
are
triggering
rates
to
go
into
effect
subject
to
refund
is
not
adequate,
what
can
we
do
other
than
what
we
did
do
to
prevent
this
triggering?
obviously
it
isn't
going
to
be
sufficient
merely
to
set
an
initial
rate
below
the
triggering
line
if
the
producers
are
free
the
next
day
to
file
for
a
triggering
rate
and
to
put
this
into
effect
unless
we
can
do
the
almost
impossible
of
completing
an
individual
company
rate
case
within
the
6-month
period
which
the
statute
gives
us.
and
the
only
effective
way
of
handling
this
problem
is
by
the
limited
moratorium
which
the
commission
has
adopted.
the
court
below
has
read
the
hunt
case
as
applying
which
approved
a
moratorium
in
that
situation,
a
temporary
certificate
situation
as
applying
the
language
of
the
court
as
applying
only
to
temporary.
and
as
a
matter
a
fact
as
specifically
limiting
the
original
catco
decision
to
the
temporary
situation
below
as
i
pointed
out
catco
involved
the
permit
certificates.
we
don't
think
the
hunt
case
can
possibly
be
read
as
that.hunt
decision
at
376
u.s.
goes
into
a
careful
analysis
of
the
relationship
between
section
4
and
section
7
of
the
act
and
it
makes
clear
that
section
4
of
the
act
is
not
an
inhibition
upon
lawful
action
under
section
7
that
the
rate
making,
rate
filing
provisions
of
section
4
as
justice
harlan
said
long
ago
in
the
mobile
case
are
not
a
grant
of
rights
to
producers
but
a
limitation,
the
procedural
limitation
on
the
exercise
of
those
rates.
and
that
by
its
very
nature
section
7
was
put
into
the
act
in
its
present
form,
the
1942
after
a
period
of
the
original
language
have
been
there
to
allow
the
commission
to
take
what
action
is
necessary
to
protect
the
public
at
this
initial
stage.
of
course
the
court
in
hunt
refused
to
pass
upon
on
the
extent,
i
think
that
was
the
word
they
used,
the
extent
of
the
power
of
the
commission
in
permit
certificates
that
wasn't
before
the
court.
and
hunt
said
that
the
commission
could
exercise
it
for
very
good
reasons
there
necessary
during
this
temporary
period
but
we
suggest
that
the
reasons
are
at
least
as
good
for
the
present
circumstances
to
again
for
a
limited
period
prevent
the
filing
of
these
extremely
high
triggering
rates.
moreover,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
the
position
adopted
by
the
court
below
in
our
opinion
is
completely
inconsistent
with
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
texaco
case
at
377
u.s.
which
followed
the
hunt
case
i
think
within
a
year.
now,
that
case
as
this
court
will
remember
authorized
the
commission
to
adopt
rules
which
would
preclude
absolutely
certain
types
of
escalation
provisions
in
permanent
certificates,
i
wasn't
talking
about
temporary
certificate.
the
rules
were
that
you
couldn't
get
any
certificate
permanent
or
temporary
if
certain
types
of
escalation
were
prohibited.
now
if
the
lower
court's
reading
of
section
as
being
an
absolute
right
was
applicable
then
the
transco
--
the
texaco
case
just
would
be
wrong.
the
lower
court
has,
i'm
sorry
to
say
in
this
instance
reverted
in
effect
to
the
errors
which
the
court
explained
in
the
hunt
case
and
is
simply
been
unwilling
to
follow
the
rational
of
hunt
and
attempted
to
limit
it
to
a
situation
which
we
don't
think
the
court
ever
attempted
to
limit
it
to.
let
me
say
a
word
to
or
passing
this
on
about
the
refund
situation.
arguments
made
here
that
the
commission
has
no
reparations
authority
like
the
icc
and
therefore
it
can't
order
refunds
in
a
situation
like
this
where
it's
granted
a
certificate
at
a
given
price
and
before
that
certificate
becomes
final
it
is
set
aside
and
the
commission
is
directed
to
issue
a
new
decision
on
the
right
rational.
i
don't
think
it
takes
any
extended
discussion
to
recognize
that
the
problems
are
not
comparable
at
all.
the
reparations
situation
applies
in
the
icc
gives
somebody
authority
even
if
the
commission
has
never
affirmed
the
rate
as
being
just
and
reasonable
but
has
allowed
it
to
go
into
effect
either
as
an
increase
or
original
rate.
go
in
and
claim
that
that
rate
is
unjust
and
unreasonable
and
get
money
--
monetary
damages
there.
now
we
don't
have
that
authority
in
the
natural
gas
act
and
once
we
certificate
a
sale
and
it's
permanent
and
final
and
non-reviewable
but
once
we
allow
a
rate
increase
to
go
into
effect
then
that's
final
except
for
prospective
changes
and
even
if
it
turns
out
that
that
was
certificated
or
allowed
to
go
into
effect,
the
two
higher
rate
there
are
no
reparations
but
that's
not
the
problem
here.
here,
the
question
is
the
perfectly
normal
conventional
situation
of
an
agency
making
an
honest
mistake
being
told
to
correct
this
and
then
having
the
people
who
were
the
beneficiaries
of
the
mistake
saying
you
can't
correct
it,
nunc
pro
tunc,
you
must
only
correct
it
prospectively.
we
just
don't
think
that
there's
anything
to
this
argument
and
the
court
below
was
clearly
correct
in
saying
that
there
wasn't.
to
the
court
of
appeals
however
inserted
its
own
ideas
as
to
measure
of
refunds.
it
agreed
that
the
normal
measure
of
refunds
in
a
situation
like
this
would
be
to
measure
what
the
commission
had
originally
granted
and
what
the
commission
should've
granted
and
require
a
payment
of
the
difference.
but
the
court
felt
that
there
were
equitable
considerations
which
required
it
setting
aside
this
order
of
the
commission
and
establishing
one
of
its
own.
the
court
said
as
i
understand
it
that
if
we
had
decided
properly
in
the
beginning
the
producers
could
have
filed
increases
at
least
with
a
triggering
limitation
therefore
would
be
unfair
to
require
them
to
make
refunds
down
to
the
proper
in
line
price
and
instead
there
should
be
no
refunds
at
the
present
moment.
and
let's
wait
and
see
what
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
is
and
then
two
or
three
years
later
have
refunds
from
the
level
that
they
had
been
charging
down
to
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
there
are
several
difficulties
with
this.
in
the
first
place,
this
completely
deprives
the
consumers
of
the
rights,
the
protection
that
the
statute
gives
them
during
the
6
months
suspension
period.
but
over
and
beyond
that
it
isn't
in
our
opinion
necessarily
a
good
thing
for
the
producers.
it
is
based
upon
an
assumption
that
permeates
the
lower
court's
opinion
based
upon
assumption
that
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
are
going
to
be
higher
than
the
in
line
price
and
that
therefore
it's
worth
that
at
least
to
the
producers
of
the
uncertainty
of
waiting
three
or
four
more
years
to
find
out
what
their
obligations
are
because
they're
going
to
have
to
pay
back
less
money.
this
assumption
isn't
necessarily
true.
i
don't
know
what
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
this
gas,
is
going
to
turn
out
to
be
this
is
the
matter
that's
being
contested
in
the
area
rate
proceeding
at
the
present
moment.
i
do
know
that
in
the
permian
decision
which
the
commission
has
recently
decided
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
that
they
set
for
gas
prior
to
1961
i.e.,
for
the
gas
that's
involved
temporarily
the
same
as
this
was
about
a
cent
or
a
cent
and
a
half
below
the
guideline
price
that
they
were
certificating
gas.
now
this
may
not
turn
out
to
be
true
here.
i
don't
--
i
can't
say
this
but
i
can
say
that
this
underlying
assumption
that
the
producers
are
going
to
gain
by
substituting
the
court's
exceptional
refund
standard
for
the
normal
one
the
commission
had
applied
may
not
benefit
everybody
and
will
certainly
hurt
the
consumers
if
we're
going
to
have
to
wait
for
another
two
or
three
years
before
they
get
refunds.
and
as
this
court
made
clear
in
the
tennessee
case
two
years
ago,
the
refund
remedy
is
a
week
one
at
best
and
it
becomes
weaker
and
weaker
as
time
runs
for
people
who
pay
the
extra
money
for
this
gas
are
just
not
going
to
be
around
if
we
have
to
wait
three
or
four
more
years
in
order
to
give
them
their
refund
remedy.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
problem
whatsoever
mr.
chief
justice
as
a
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
law
is
that
it
has
to
be
raised
twice.
it
has
to
be
raised
before
the
commission
on
rehearing,
that's
19
(a)
of
the
act
and
it
has
to
be
raised
in
the
notice
of
appeal
in
the
circuit
court,
that's
19
(b)
of
the
act.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it's
a
matter
of
reading
these
pleadings
and
we
have
not
raised
the
issue.
mr.
coleman's
client
has
raised
the
issue.
it's
a
matter
of
how
you
interpret
pleadings
both
on
rehearing
and
in
the
notice
of
appeal.
they
are
properly
to
be
brought
before
this
court.
what
happens
here
is
that
a
special
statute
that
congress
passed
about
10
years
ago
recognizing
that
these
administrative
records
are
--
would
burdensome
on
the
courts
which
permits
the
agency
and
we've
taken
advantage
of
it
to
--
instead
of
filing
this
complete
record
to
file
a
certification
of
what
is
in
the
record
and
keep
the
physical
record
before
the
commission
and
this
is
what
we've
done
here.
and
then
as
mr.
hicks
said,
you
decide
among
yourselves
what
you'll
print.
but
these
materials,
these
pleadings
and
the
notice
of
appeal
itself
are
proper
matters
to
be
brought
before
this
court
anytime
anybody
wants
to
and
none
of
us
on
our
side
have
any
objection
to
any
of
these
gentlemen
filing
their
petitions
for
rehearing
with
the
commission
or
they're
notices
of
appeal
with
this
court
as
to
the
issue
of
what
they
contain.
this
is
a
matter
for
your
interpretation.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
do
have
a
couple
of
factual
matters
that
i
thought
maybe
i
should
bring
to
the
court's
attention.
there
were
some
questions
earlier
in
the
argument
about
the
evidentiary
basis,
to
the
extent
to
which
the
triggering
moratorium
got
into
the
case.
and
i
think
i
can
make
that
fairly
clear.
during
the
course
of
the
hearings
in
this
proceeding,
the
staff
of
the
commission
and
i
think
one
of
the
intervenors
as
well,
argued
that
a
special
separate
triggering
condition
should
be
included
with
respect
to
certain
sales
that
are
being
made
to
transco.
i
don't
even
remember
who
they're
being
made
by.
but
this
argument
that
a
special
triggering
condition
could
be
made
on
some
of
these
sales
but
not
others
was
rejected
by
the
examiner
and
subsequently
by
the
commission.
it
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
although
this
triggering
might
have
occurred
at
an
earlier
stage,
this
was
unfortunately
water
over
the
dam
that
you
couldn't
undo
it
with
the
condition
and
they
refused
this
special
condition.
but
they
did
go
ahead
in
their
decision
and
this
is
at
page
578
of
the
record
to
explain
why
they
were
putting
in
the
general
limited
moratorium
that
i've
mentioned.
now
the
evidence,
the
basis
for
the
23.55
cents
was
not
something
that
had
been
litigated
at
an
earlier
stage
in
this
proceeding.
the
23.5
moratorium
price
level
as
the
commission
makes
clear
on
page
578
was
based
upon
official
notice
of
the
commission
at
that
time
took
of
the
various
rate
schedules
involving
the
pipelines
whose
sales
were
involved
here.
this
is
something
pursuant
to
both
act,
an
obvious
equity
which
could
have
been
challenged
as
a
factual
matter
by
any
of
these
parties
on
rehearing.
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
in
a
subsequent
case,
not
this
one,
one
of
these
parties
or
one
of
their
affiliates
did
challenge
this
very
same
23.55
level
when
it
was
applied
in
the
subsequent
case.
and
in
that
case,
the
commission
went
on
and
explained
as
a
matter
of
fact
why
he'd
adopted
it.
but
in
this
particular
case,
nobody
challenged
the
23.55
cent
level
as
a
triggering
level.
they
all
challenged
our
legal
right
under
the
hunt
case
and
under
the
legal
doctrines
to
insert
any
moratorium
and
odeco
did
say
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
supporting
this
thing
but
nobody
challenged
the
basis,
the
official
notice
basis
of
the
commission
that
23.55
cents
was
in
fact
a
level
which
was
likely
to
cause
triggering
and
that's
why
we
say
that
the
question
of
this
level
is
not
before
this
court.
now,
as
to
the
refund
matter,
i
think
it
was
justice
brennan
or
justice
clark
that
was
raising
the
question
of
whether
this
wasn't
at
least
divisible
as
of
the
time
of
the
commission's
decision.
and
as
to
that
matter,
i
think
mr.
hicks
inadvertently
misstated
what
happened
because
he
suggested
that
this
matter
was
not
divisible
that
they
either
have
to
accept
everything
or
nothing.
this
isn't
quite
true.
when
the
commission
issued
its
initial
decision
there
are
requests
made
for
stay
of
everything
by
these
various
parties.
but
the
commission
emulating
my
illustrious
predecessor
did
split
may
be
here
and
if
you'll
look
at
page
615
and
616
of
the
record,
you'll
see
that
the
commission
at
that
time
granted
a
stay
itself
as
to
past
refunds
which
obviously
couldn't
be
affected
by
what
happened
in
the
future.
but
rejected
a
stay
for
the
future
and
the
problems
if
there
are
any
that
have
been
caused
since
this
commission
decision
with
respect
to
refunds
are
entirely
because
these
people
then
went
ahead
and
persuaded
the
fifth
circuit
to
grant
them
a
stay.
so
at
least
to
that
extent,
mr.
justice
brennan
was
quite
right
in
saying
that
this
matter
was
divisible.
actually,
with
respect
to
this
refund
matter,
at
least
since
1960
and
61
when
these
cases
were
remanded
by
the
various
courts
of
appeals
and
in
one
case
by
this
court,
all
of
these
parties
were
well
aware
of
the
jeopardy
they
were
in.
and
in
january
1962,
the
commission
expressed
order,
said
that
they
were
going
to
be
liable
to
refunds
and
express
the
standards
that
they're
going
to
be
liable
to.
so
to
the
extent
that
there
are
equitable
problems
of
the
measure
of
refunds,
what
they
should
or
should
not
be,
i
would
think
that
if
anything
that
exist
only
for
this
very
early
period
while
the
case
is
on
appeal
to
the
court
and
as
i've
indicated
in
my
brief
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
would
think
probably
from
1959
to
1961
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
this
is
when
the
case
was
pending
in
the
court.
but
as
we
argue,
we
don't
even
think
it's
for
that.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
right.
and
it
will
definitely
mean
that
these
people
will
be
worse
off
than
they
would
have
been
if
they
had
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right,
yes.
that
people
who
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
they
could
have
in
1960
--
certainly
in
1963
when
we
issued
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
this
decision.
accepted
this
part
of
the
decision
at
least
not
as
for
a
stay
of
it
put
into
effect
the
20
cent
rate
and
filed
for
their
higher
rate
up
to
the
23.5
moratorium.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
they
couldn't
have
done
it
without
a
special
order
in
the
commission.
they
would've
had
to
come
around
and
ask
a
support.
they
couldn't
have
done
it
on
their
own.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
they
only
knew
that
the
price
they
had
was
out
of
line
and
not
going
to
be
growing.
finally,
let
me
say
a
word
about
the
in-line
price
itself
and
the
evidence
thereto.
there
were
some
suggestion
here
that
are
dismissal
of
the
rates
of
more
than
18.5
cents
as
suspect
in
fact
affected
by
catco
was
something
we
just
did
without
any
basis
for
it.
this
isn't
true.
the
examiner
went
into
this
matter
at
some
length
and
he
pointed
out
that
there
was
testimony
in
the
original
dockets
when
they
were
getting
these
very
high
prices,
in
these
very
cases
in
which
the
main
buyer
of
gas
were
transco
and
made
clear
that
the
only
reason
he
paid
these
prices
which
were
way
out
of
line
which
transco
had
ever
paid
before
was
because
of
the
effect
of
the
catco
decision
which
had
been
issued
by
the
commission
briefs.
and
it
was
on
the
basis
of
this
type
of
evidence
that
both
the
examiner
and
the
commission
itself
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
higher
prices
here
were
not
merely
suspect
but
were
in
fact
corrupted
by
the
earlier
catco
prices.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
more
i
really
have
to
say
except
if
i
may
move
from
the
epithet
that
justice
clark
used
a
little
earlier
when
he
said
that
our
in-line
price
is
a
stop
gap
price.
this
is
true
but
with
one
amendment
which
i
think
justice
harlan
referred
to
and
that
is,
it's
a
stop
gap
price
only
in
the
sense
that
it's
a
--
the
starting
price
and
within
triggering
limitations,
it
is
a
price
which
people
could
escalate
up
to
from.
it
is
in
other
words
we
say
the
in-line
price
which
we
are
setting,
is
the
price
which
these
people
can
charge
without
future
refund
obligations
and
anything
they
want
to
charge
which
they
can
charge
under
their
contracts
above
that,
they
have
to
take
the
risk
of
further
refund.
thank
you.
