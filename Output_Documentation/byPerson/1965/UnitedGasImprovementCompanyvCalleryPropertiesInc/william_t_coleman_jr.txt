mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
good
afternoon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioners
in
number
21
are
three
eastern
distribution
company's
which
sell
gas
to
the
ultimate
consumer
in
philadelphia,
pennsylvania
and
one
of
them
sells
it
on
long
island,
new
york.
the
prices
which
the
pipeline
must
pay
the
respondent
producers
for
the
gas
while
they
affect
the
price
which
distribution
companies
pay
the
pipelines
and
thus
affect
directly
the
consumer.
i
think
that
it
was
mr.
justice
brennan
when
we
were
here
last
term
in
ugi
versus
continental
oil
company
in
the
rayne
field
case,
it
pointed
out
that
he
was
struck
as
anyone
has
to
be
by
the
fact
that
the
pipelines
never
come
in
to
resist
these
high
prices.
and
the
reason
is
that
the
pipelines
just
pass
the
cost
on
to
the
distribution
companies
and
therefore
it's
the
interest
of
the
distribution
companies
that
have
to
come
in
and
demonstrate
that
these
prices
are
too
high.
and
as
you
know
at
the
beginning
of
the
commission
failed
to
exercise
its
responsibility
under
section
7
of
the
act
and
as
a
result
of
that,
the
prices
went
from
plateau
to
plateau.
and
finally
after
litigation
where
ugi,
the
philadelphia
electric
and
the
long
island
lighting
and
also
mr.
kent
brown
representing
the
new
york
public
service
commission
brought
litigation
to
the
court's
in
two
cases
came
to
this
court.
the
commission
finally
began
to
develop
an
effective
and
viable
regulatory
approach
in
order
to
bring
under
control
the
prices
charged
the
pipelines
for
gas.
obviously
the
petitioners
in
21
want
this
court
to
affirm
and
improve
the
system
of
initial
price
regulation
developed
by
the
commission.
incidentally,
if
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
stands
then
there
are
at
least
nine
cases
which
would
have
to
be
retried
by
the
commission.
we
set
them
forth
in
our
brief.
now,
i'd
like
to
deal
with
two
issues,
one
is
the
exclusion
of
evidence
question
and
the
other
is
a
moratorium
question
and
my
brother
brown
will
discuss
the
refund
matter.
now
the
producers'
position
has
to
be
that
section
7
provides
them
an
absolute
statutory
right
to
insist
that
the
commission
in
any
case
merely
because
the
producers
request
it
must
determine
by
the
use
of
individual
course
evidence
whether
the
proposed
initial
price
though
admittedly
out
of
line
with
other
sales
in
the
area
nevertheless
must
be
considered
and
you
must
certify
after
you
determine
that
that
will
provide
only
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
in
other
words,
you
have
to
determine
whether
as
a
matter
of
lore
in
the
initial
certification
procedure
a
producer
has
the
actual
statutory
right
to
have
that
proven
and
if
he
--
and
until
that
point
is
reached
the
commission
cannot
the
certify
this
sale.
now
obviously
if
you
reach
that
question,
you
have
a
subsidiary
question
which
i
think
is
quite
important.
how
do
you
measure
that?
is
it
based
upon
his
entire
course
or
is
it
based
upon
the
course
of
this
particular
well?
actually
before
we
get
to
that
there
isn't
a
question
which
will
dispose
of
these
cases
to
require
reversal
on
a
much
more
narrow
ground
and
that
is
whether
the
evidence
which
these
producers
tendered
had
to
be
accepted.
now,
if
you
return
to
page
623
of
the
record
which
is
judge
brown's
opinion
below.
in
the
second
--
in
the
first
full
paragraph
where
he
says
that
this
evidence
offered,
this
course
of
service
evidence
follow
generally
to
pattern
used
by
the
commission
in
prior
determinations.
then
go
down.
these
also
use
techniques
and
methods
employed
by
the
commission
in
determining
analogous
minimum
financial
requirements.
now
this
statement
is
not
quite
accurate
because
that's
not
exactly
what
the
court
below
did
and
what
the
commission
did.
if
you
will
turn
to
page
495
of
the
record
where
the
examiner
describes
the
type
of
evidence
which
was
actually
offered
you
will
find
that
the
evidence
is
in
three
categories.
one
is
so-called
cost
to
service
studies.
now,
there
the
examiner
said
that
he
was
going
to
exclude
those
not
only
because
this
evidence
was
irrelevant
in
a
section
7
preceding
but
also
that
the
studies
were
prepared
in
a
method
which
didn't
comply
with
the
commission's
decision.
so
therefore
it
seems
to
me
that
on
that
basis
alone
you'd
have
to
reverse
the
third
--
the
fifth
circuit
because
certainly
the
commission
doesn't
have
to
take
studies
which
were
prepared
in
a
way
not
consonant
with
their
records.
secondly
with
respect
to
a
number
of
discounted
cash
flow
studies
similar
to
the
one
rejected
by
the
commission
in
catco,
now
once
again,
in
this
proceeding
you
have
the
producers
offering
evidence
which
in
another
proceeding
the
commission
is
said
that
doesn't
help
us.
that's
not
proper
evidence.
and
thirdly,
with
respect
to
economic
trend
day
or
studies
similar
to
one
offered
in
el
paso
natural
gas
company
which
the
commission
in
that
proceeding
found
after
taking
the
evidence,
having
cross-examination
on
it,
determine
that
it
had
no
real
property
value.
and
actually
when
you
read
the
record
on
page
204
-
206
of
the
record
you
will
find
where
the
examiner
had
the
witness
on
the
stand
and
said,
"did
you
do
this
study
in
the
same
way
that
it
was
dealt
in
el
paso
is
exactly
the
same
thing?"
and
the
witness
said,
"yes."
so
therefore
the
issue
is
having
received
this
study
in
another
case
having
to
had
four
cross-examination
on
it,
do
you
still
as
a
matter
of
law
have
to
take
it
again,
mark
it
and
then
cross-examine
it?
and
if
you
do
that
would
mean
that
counsel
once
again
we
have
to
go
through
the
same
cross-examination
only
to
find
at
end
if
you've
done
this
and
taken
all
of
this
time
that
it's
going
to
be
rejected.
and
i've
been
trying
to
find
some
way
to
make
this
graphically
and
i
must
come
back
to
a
bit
of
(inaudible)
which
is
ascribed
to
sir
winston
churchill
when
he
had
an
occasion,
were
on
a
three
different
occasions
in
the
parliament,
a
particular
bill
was
offered
and
it
was
defeated
and
then
the
same
bill
was
offered
again
and
the
proponents
were
saying
you
must
give
us
another
hearing.
and
mr.
churchill
is
alleged
to
have
said,
"i
hear
a
line
in
the
lobby
roar,
say
mr.
speaker
shall
we
shut
the
door
and
keep
him
there
or
shall
we
let
him
in
although
we
know,
we
must
put
him
out
again."
and
the
issue
really
here
is
do
you
have
to
go
to
this
motion,
take
all
of
this
evidence
when
you've
had
the
experience
to
know
that
after
you
take
it
all
and
examine
it,
it
doesn't
help
you
to
reach
the
answer.
now
and
i
think
that
even
those
that
concurred
in
catco
on
that
basis
would
have
to
determine
that
in
this
case
you
have
to
reverse
the
fifth
circuit
and
affirm
the
commission.
now
when
you
come
to
the
more
broad
issue
assuming
which
is
contrary
to
the
fact
that
the
evidence
actually
offered
had
been
properly
prepared
and
presented
it's
still
the
position
--
petition's
position
that
the
commission
did
not
--
then
i
have
to
accept
it
and
thus
convert
the
section
7
proceeding
into
a
section
4
or
section
5
proceeding.
now
judge
brown
below
and
the
producers
here
are
not
quite
certain
as
to
just
what
proposed
evidence
would
do.
if
you
will
look
at
page
631
and
632
of
the
record
you
will
find
that
judge
brown
says,
"well,
even
though
all
of
this
evidence
is
to
come
in
it's
a
type
of
evidence
that
you
usually
use
to
prove
just
and
reasonable
price
is
but
nevertheless
the
commission
ought
to
have
some
technique
and
some
method
where
they
can
take
all
this
evidence
but
they
don't
have
to
take
the
time
to
dispose
of
it."
and
if
you
look
at
the
brief
in
the
superior
oil
company
case
on
page
22
you
will
finally
recognize
the
same
problem
that
although
they
want
all
these
individual
cost
studies
in.
and
although
it's
the
same
exact
evidence
that
the
next
store
on
an
area
basis
that
they're
putting
in
the
area
rate
cases,
they
say,
"well,
you
don't
have
to
determine
precisely
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
the
only
necessary
finding
is
that
on
the
basis
of
showing
me
the
proposed
higher
prices
does
not
appear
to
be
excessive
or
is
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness."
so
what
the
producers
are
here
opting
for
it
is
something
other
than
the
just
and
reasonable
determination
but
on
the
other
hand
they
want
to
be
able
to
do
something
other
than
show
that
this
particular
rate
is
in
line.
now
the
commission
faced
up
to
this
problem
from
the
time
you
reversed
catco
and
in
a
series
of
decisions
beginning
with
catco
(inaudible)
--
remand
which
is
the
continental
oil
company
case,
i
think
it's
in
222
of
federal
power
commission
reports
until
this
case.
the
commission
struggled
with
this
problem
and
they
attempted
to
try
to
find
out,
can
you
take
less
than
and
into
if
you
take
a
cost
of
study
--
will
that
help
you?
do
you
have
to
go
through
all
the
examination
that
you
had
in
the
philips?
can
you
take
something
less
than
that?
oh,
every
bit
of
evidence
that
the
producers
here
are
attempting
to
offer
the
commission
in
these
earlier
case
accepted
it,
took
a
lot
of
time
to
cross-examine
it.
they
studied
it,
they
wrote
opinions
and
every
one
of
these
opinions
clearly
demonstrates
that
this
evidence
just
doesn't
help
you
to
determine
the
public
ser
--
the
convenience
price.
and
in
appendix
b
of
our
brief
we
took
the
relevant
abstracts
of
each
one
of
these
cases
and
as
you
work
your
way
through
these
abstracts
you
will
certainly
say
here
that
you
have
an
administrative
agent
that
tried
every
way
to
meet
this
problem.
and
when
you
look
at
it
you
will
find
that
when
you
accept
this
evidence,
you
find
it
producers
in
one
case
saying
that
the
cost
of
the
gas
were
30.79
cents
per
mcf.
in
another
case
they
were
saying
that
its
$2.78
per
mcf.
but
at
the
same
time
they
were
saying
that
they
were
trying
to
get
a
certificate
at
16
cents.
and
it
doesn't
take
much
judgment
to
realize
that
in
those
circumstances
all
of
these
particular
theories
just
don't
make
sense
because
obviously
it
doesn't
cost
you
$2
and
78
cents
to
produce
gas
if
you
sell
it
for
16
cents
or
if
you're
willing
to
sell
it
for
16
cents.
so,
finally
after
going
through
all
this
the
commission
finally
in
the
skelly
oil
case
said
to
discharge
our
responsibility
that
we
just
can't
take
this
type
of
evidence
because
it's
completely
irrelevant
and
therefore,
this
decision
here
is
clearly
based
upon
the
expertness
of
the
administrative
agency.
we
say
that
or
it
is
said
in
a
lot
of
opinions
but
in
this
case
you
have
a
clear
demonstration
that
they
tried
all
of
this
but
it
just
wouldn't
work
and
incidentally
that's
exactly
what
this
court
thought
would
have
in
catco
because
in
catco
they
said
that
if
its
out
of
line
you
can
reject
it,
period.
but
you
don't
have
to
take
it
and
they
told
the
commission
you
should
take
it
only
if
it
turns
out
that
there's
a
showing
that
it
is
just
and
reasonable
rate.
but
it
didn't'
follow
from
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
commission
has
to
engage
in
that
particular
determination.
that
the
commission
can
say
that
since
there
are
plenty
of
people
in
this
area
that
are
willing
to
sell
gas
at
“the
going
rate”
that
that's
the
only
price
at
which
you
can
put
your
gas
interstate
commerce
and
that
we
cannot
take
the
time
to
determine
whether
it's
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
you
and
that's
all
this
case
is
about.
now
if
we
turn
to
the
issue
of
the
moratorium
i
think
to
put
this
a
problem
in
proper
focus.
i'd
like
to
ask
the
court
to
turn
to
page
391
of
the
record
where
you
will
see
the
superior
oil
--
sorry.
just
indulge
me
just
a
minute
your
honor.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
oh,
that's
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
no
that's
the
wrong
page
your
honor
and
i'm
trying
to
find
the
page,
it's
the
superior
oil
about.
i
--
just
indulge
me
just
a
minute.
well,
in
any
event
in
the
superior
oil
contract
and
i
will
get
you
to
page,
in
that
contract
the
initial
price
is
below
23.55
cents
but
within
four
years,
i'm
sorry
it's
page
47
of
the
record
your
honor,
(inaudible)
47.
and
you
will
see
that
in
superior
contract
they
set
forth
the
prices.
now
the
initial
price
is
21.44
so
in
this
case
under
the
commission
rule
they
would
have
to
take
the
certificate
at
the
20
cents.
they
then
could
file
up
to
the
21.4
and
indeed
since
it's
beyond
july
1,
1962
they
could
file
up
to
23.44
cents.
then
on
july
1,
1966
under
the
contract,
they
could
file
up
to
25.4
which
is
above
the
triggering
rate
and
therefore
the
commission
says
that
as
a
matter
of
public
necessity
and
convenience
that
it's
our
judgment
that
we
ought
not
to
let
this
gas
move
into
interstate
commerce
under
this
contract
if
there's
a
provision
in
the
contract
which
would
permit
you
to
file
up
beyond
the
triggering
rate
prior
to
the
time
that
we've
abled
to
get
this
thing
under
control
and
determine
what
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
is.
now
it's
clear
under
catco
that
if
paragraph
--
subparagraph
c
which
is
the
25.4
rate
was
paragraph
a,
namely
the
initial
rate
that
in
catco
this
court
has
instructed
the
commission
that
under
those
circumstances
you
ought
not
to
certify
this
contract
because
merely
by
permitting
this
contract
and
the
gas
are
going
to
interstate
commerce,
you
are
causing
the
triggering.
and
it
certainly
ought
to
be
the
same
measure
and
the
same
problem
if
it
isn't
in
the
paragraph
a,
but
there's
a
later
escalation
clause
in
the
contract
which
will
achieve
exactly
the
same
result.
and
that's
the
reason
why
the
commission
is
determined
that
where
you
have
a
situation
which
would
cause
this
triggering
if
this
particular
contract
is
permitted
to
become
effective
that
we
will
certify
this
particular
contract
if
and
only
if
you
will
take
a
condition
which
says
that
you
won't
put
into
effect
that
provision
until
after
without
a
time
to
determine
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
now
in
your
cases
just
last
term
you
held
that
you
can
have
an
absolute
prohibition.
now,
this
is
not
an
absolute
prohibition
because
even
though
it
takes
long
--
the
commission
longer
than
july
1,
1967
to
get
around
to
this
nevertheless
the
party
thereafter
could
file.
and
i
think
that
the
clearest
way
to
just
pin
this
point
down
is
to
recognize
that
no
producer
has
a
constitutional
right
to
inject
his
gas
into
the
stream
of
interstate
commerce
regardless
of
its
course.
i
mean
for
example,
if
a
particular
producer
will
show
or
would
show
they
would
cost
him
50
cents
to
produce
his
gas
but
you
can
find
--
get
all
of
the
gas
you
want
at
18
cents
certainly
in
the
commission
would
have
the
power
to
say,
"well,
if
it
cost
you
that
much
to
produce
your
gas,
we're
not
going
to
let
you
put
it
in
interstate
commerce
because
not
only
will
that
affect
the
consumer
but
in
addition
it
will
cause
us
this
triggering
because
all
of
these
--
under
these
predetermination
cost,
all
those
other
contracts
will
go
up."
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
the
answer
to
that
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
sir
i
think
as
far
as
your
problem
is
concerned
as
the
reviewing
court
that
if
you
will
turn
to
page
633
of
the
record
which
is
footnote
33
that
judge
brown
assumes
that
there
was
the
factual
basis
for
the
commissions
finding.
so
i
think
as
reviewing
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
particular
problem
because
the
reversal
in
the
fifth
circuit
was
based
upon
the
assumption
that
this
was
a
fact.
secondly,
the
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
eventually.
well,
i
think
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
in
view
of
that
footnote
and
the
fact
that
the
court
below
did
not
upset
the
finding
that
you
ought
to
accept
that
finding
and
decide
the
case
on
that
basis.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well--
well,
it's
a
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
sir,
we're
in
the
business
of
words
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
we're
in
the
business
of
trying
to
find
out
what
words
means.
i
don't
think
it's
a
quibble
to
face
up
to
what
the
words
mean
but
i
say
that
we
don't
have
that
problem
here
because
the
court
below
did
not
upset
with
respect
to
that
particular
finding.
and
secondly
in
the
opinion
of
the
commission
which
is
398
beginning
on
page
550
the
commission
finds
as
a
fact
that
at
above
23.55
cents
there
would
be
triggering.
if
you
look
on
page
578
in
the
middle
of
the
page
it
says
an
examination
of
the
applicable
contracts
of
transco
hope
and
united
reveals
that
triggering
and
price
redetermination
will
take
place
at
a
price
in
excess
of
23.55
cents
per
mcf.
but
i
do
think
that
you
have
that
commission
determination
and
if
you
will
note
from
the
government
the
footnote
in
the
government's
brief,
the
government
says
that
the
exceptions
didn't
raise
that
question
of
the
finding.
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument
the
history
or
regulations
since
catco
graphically
reveals
that
the
commission
has
struggled
with
a
monumental
problem.
after
many
false
starts
revisions
based
upon
trial
and
error
it
has
now
achieved
a
quick,
viable
and
effective
method
of
regulation.
its
technique
and
procedure
should
be
affirmed.
indeed
they
should
be
commended.
even
the
producers
say
that
most
of
the
producers
have
agreed
and
have
accepted
this
method
of
regulation
but
because
there
are
2%
that
are
holding
out
that
this
commission
should
scrap
this
whole
program
and
start
over
again
and
it
really
doesn't
make
much
difference
because
there
are
going
to
be
2%.
well,
i
assure
you
if
the
lawyers
of
the
producers
have
revised
their
clients
they
have
to
accept
this
method,
a
regulation
if
it
turns
out
that
they
are
wrong
i
assure
you
that
every
producer
will
be
in
and
the
2%
will
go
back
to
the
98%.
mr.
brown
will
address
himself
to
the
refund
issue.
the
only
point
on
that
i
would
like
raise
and
we're
the
only
one
that
raised
in
our
brief
so
i
think
i
should
mention
it
that
on
the
question
of
the
level
of
the
refund
namely
whether
it
should
be
the
difference
between
the
just
--
between
the
rate
actually
certified
and
the
rate
which
was
charged
or
whether
you
used
is
just
and
reasonable.
this
was
something
that
the
producers
never
urged
before
the
commission
or
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
you
have
a
case
in
334
u.s.
which
is
the
colorado
interstate
case
which
makes
it
clear
that
as
a
matter
of
law
if
they
don't
raise
that
that
this
court
cannot
address
itself
to
that
particular
problem.
so
i
just
think
on
that
point
along
that
you
have
to
reverse
the
fifth
circuit
because
the
fifth
circuit
went
out
of
its
way
and
sua
sponte
raised
an
issue.
i
think
the
reason
why
you
can't,
if
you
just
read
section
19,
it
says
that
the
court
of
appeals
can
only
address
itself
to
those
issues
raised
in
the
petition
for
rehearing.
