justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
attwell,
didn't
i
understand
that
--
that
was
mr.
solomon,
someone
to
say
yesterday
that
this
presently
an
area
rate
proceeding
of
the
conclusions
of
which
will
have
a
bearing
on
the
in-line
rate
here?
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
do
i
--
do
you
understand
that
not
only
the
printed
records
here,
not
the
rest
of
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
those
have
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
don't
misunderstand
me.
i
simply
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
how
long
--
you've
been
getting
the
contract
prices,
59
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
there
has
been
no
compliance
with
the
18.5
rate
at
any
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
true
or
wrong
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you've
been
collecting
--
you
had
the
stay
so
you're
still
collecting
23.55?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
subject
to
refund
over
just
and
reasonable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
isn't
your
--
your
argument
is
premised
on
an
obligation
to
refund
under
the
commission
order
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
denied,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
commission
order
ob
--
obliges
you
to
make
the
refund
how
far
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
what
--
and
then
after
1963,
you
have
a
stay
against
the
commission's
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
had
in
1963
complied
with
the
board
order
and
you'd
have
no
refund
problem
now,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
earlier.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
not
since
â€˜63.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
point
is
that
whatever
the
period
from
1959
to
1963
or
1963
to
date,
the
measure
of
any
obligation
ought
to
be
faced
in
just
and
reasonable
rates
and
not
on
this
in-line
price.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask?
i
suppose
you've
got
the
stay
or
may
i
put
it
this
way.
if
you
had
got
the
stay
or
had
not
got
the
stay
but
had
complied
and
reduced
to
20
something
and
then
the
just
and
reasonable
price
were
something
in
excess
of
20.5
whatever
that
figure
is,
you'd
never
be
able
to
get
that,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
the
reason
that
you
insisted
on
--
or
rather
why
you've
got
to
stay?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
could
you
have
put
the
price
to
that
effect
and
then
under
the
commission's
order
have
immediately
gone
up
to
23.55
over
again
subject
to
refund?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
couldn't
take
it
in
pieces.
you
haven't
take
the
whole
thing
or
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
solomon,
is
there
any
question
about
the
--
it's
only
that
the
--
its
on
the
rate
yesterday
and
both
from
the
--
in
your
principle
that
if
the
matter
wasn't
raised
in
the
commission,
it
could
not
be
determined
in
the
courts
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
what
was
the
importance
of
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
1961,
that's
when
you
had
the
first
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
could
they
have
done
that
in
1961?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
(inaudible)
about
any
in-line
price
at
1961?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
did
