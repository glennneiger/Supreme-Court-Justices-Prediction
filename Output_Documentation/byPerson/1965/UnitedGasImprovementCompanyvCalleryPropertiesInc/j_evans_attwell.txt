mr.
j.
evans
attwell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
ocean
drilling
and
exploration
company,
the
petitioner
in
number
26
and
a
respondent
in
numbers
21
and
22
and
32.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
price
increase
moratorium
imposed
by
the
commission
in
this
case.
and
in
particular
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
questions
yesterday
as
to
whether
triggering
was
an
issue
in
the
hearings
before
the
commission
and
whether
there
was
evidence
to
show
that
the
filing
of
price
increases
above
23.55
cents
per
mcf
would
trigger
price
increases
in
other
contracts.
to
both
questions,
the
answer
is,
“no”.
the
commission
imposed
the
price
increase
moratorium
without
notice
or
hearing.
this
condition
is
not
even
discussed
in
the
presiding
examiner's
opinion.
contrary
to
mr.
brown's
statement
yesterday,
it
is
not
perfectly
obvious
that
the
filing
of
any
price
increase
above
23.55
cents
would
trigger
an
upsurge
of
prices.
there
is
simply
no
evidence
of
record
to
support
the
23.55
cent
level
or
the
july
1,
1967
cutoff
date
used
by
the
commission.
there
is
an
attachment
to
the
commission
staffs
and
memorandum
of
position
which
appears
in
the
record
and
this
purports
to
show
that
triggering
would
occur
at
the
23.55
cents
price.
however,
this
memorandum
of
position
was
never
introduced
into
evidence,
wasn't
--
never
cross-examined
and
we
were
never
given
the
opportunity
to
present
any
rebuttal
evidence.
i
do
not
believe
that
such
memorandum
did
or
was
intended
to
constitute
evidence
in
this
case.
i
might
also
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
shows
as
early
as
1959
or
1960
that
the
commission
certificated
prices
for
sales
of
gas
from
south
louisiana
which
are
being
made
today
at
a
price
of
24.05
cents
per
mcf.
some
mentioned
was
made
yesterday
as
to
whether
this
point
of
error
was
properly
reserve
--
preserved.
i
would
simply
ask
the
court
to
look
at
the
application
for
rehearing
filed
on
behalf
of
my
client
appearing
at
record
page
603.
i
believe
that
this
point
of
error
is
adequately
preserved.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
since
the
--
it
was
not
raised
at
all
in
the
hearings
or
in
the
examiner's
decision.
we
had
no
notice
or
opportunity
to
object
to
this
provision
at
an
earlier
time.
further
as
mr.
justice
stewart
noted
yesterday,
the
court
below
did
not
make
any
finding
as
to
whether
triggering
would
occur
at
the
23.05
cent
price
but
merely
assumed
that
there
was
a
factual
basis
for
the
commission's
finding.
i
would
like
now
to
turn
briefly
to
the
commission's
exclusion
of
all
evidence
in
this
case
except
that
of
selected
certificated
prices
in
the
area.
we
agree
with
the
court
below
that
the
commission
erred
in
excluding
all
cost,
economic
and
financial
evidence
tended
to
show
that
our
proposed
prices
were
the
lowest,
reasonable
prices
consistent
with
the
maintenance
of
adequate
gas
supplies
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
consuming
public.
we
do
not
say
that
the
commission
should
not
determine
the
in-line
price.
on
the
contrary,
we
recognized
as
did
the
court
below
that
whether
a
proposed
price
is
in
line
with
other
prices
in
the
area
is
an
important
and
some
time
decisive
factor.
we
do
say
that
if
the
commission
determines
that
a
proposed
price
is
out
of
line,
it
must
receive
and
consider
other
evidence
tendered
to
show
that
the
proposed
price
is
consistent
with
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
even
if
such
price
is
out
of
line
with
other
certificated
prices
in
the
area.
counsel
for
the
commission
stated
yesterday
that
the
commission
had
determined
that
it
was
not
in
the
public
interest
to
certificate
a
price
about
20
cents
per
mcf.
in
this
case.
but
how
does
the
commission
reach
that
conclusion
without
even
considering
the
evidence.
we
intended
to
show
that
our
prices
were
consistent
with
the
interest
of
the
consumer
and
the
producer
alike.
the
commission
had
a
statutory
duty
to
consider
such
evidence
in
determining
whether
our
prices
were
in
the
present
or
future
public
convenience
and
necessity.
this
is
particularly
true
since
under
section
7
of
the
act,
we,
the
producers,
have
the
burden
of
proof
to
show
that
our
proposed
prices
are
in
the
public
interest.
therefore,
we
are
entitled
to
an
opportunity
to
meet
this
burden
and
refusing
to
consider
any
evidence
in
this
case
except
that
of
selected
certificated
sales
in
the
area,
the
commission
has
denied
us
this
opportunity.
ironically,
the
commission
claims
that
its
evidentiary
exclusion
is
founded
upon
this
court's
decision
in
the
catco
case.
however,
catco
was
reversed
because
the
commi
--
producers
had
not
presented
sufficient
evidence
to
support
unconditional
certification
of
their
proposed
price.
in
reversing,
this
court
admonished
the
commission
to
hold
the
line
but
it
also
told
the
commission
to
consider
all
factors
bearing
upon
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
the
commission
has
taken
to
hold
the
line
admonition
but
it
has
completely
disregarded
the
court's
statement
that
it
was
obligated
to
consider
all
factors
bearing
on
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
we
believe
that
in
the
present
case,
the
court
is
confronted
with
almost
the
reverse
of
the
situation
which
confronted
in
catco.
there,
the
producers
and
the
commission
sought
to
sustain
permanent
certification
of
their
proposed
prices
on
a
minimal
evidentiary
showing.
here,
the
commission
and
various
intervenors
seek
to
sustain
a
reduction
and
proposed
prices
based
upon
the
same
type
of
minimal
evidentiary
showing.
we
believe
that
section
7
of
the
act
and
this
court's
catco
decision
require
something
in
the
middle.
it
is
our
position
that
the
commission
cannot
determine
the
lowest
reasonable
rate
consistent
with
the
maintenance
of
adequate
gas
supplies
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
consumer,
if
it
limits
its
consideration
to
selected
certificated
prices
in
a
particular
area.
and
what
reasons
do
the
commission
and
other
petitioners
give
to
support
this
exclusion
of
all
economic
evidence,
cost
and
financial
evidence,
and
all
other
evidence
except
that
of
selected
certificated
prices
in
the
area.
at
no
time
have
they
denied
that
the
evidence
proffered
was
relevant
to
a
determination
of
the
present
and
future
public
convenience
and
necessity.
instead,
they
urge
that
this
court
authorize
the
in-line
price
concept
because
the
administrative
process
will
break
down.
well,
the
overwhelmed
to
buy
a
mountain
of
economic
and
cost
evidence
which
will
make
it
basically
impossible
for
the
commission
to
perform
its
statutory
function.
we
believe
that
the
commission
has
greatly
exaggerated
this
problem.
the
alleged
sector
of
an
administrative
monstrosity
simply
does
not
exist.
the
commission
paints
a
picture
of
being
confronted
with
hundreds
of
producer
certificate
applications
which
will
create
administrative
chaos
if
you'd
consider
it
individually.
yet
the
commission's
annual
reports
to
congress
show
that
97%
of
all
producer
certificate
applications
do
not
even
require
formal
hearings
even
in
the
remaining
3%
of
the
cases,
the
hearings
will
not
be
unduly
extended
as
in
this
case.
it
is
the
commission's
practice
to
consolidate
for
hearing.
all
pending
producer
certificate
applications
from
a
particular
area
as
in
this
case
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
believe
they
do
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
of
course
mr.
chief
justice,
we
were
not
parties
to
those
hearings.
we
do
not
know
what
that
evidence
was
identical
to
the
evidence
we
have
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
our
evidence
in
this
case
is
material
to
a
determination
of
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
i
will
say
in
those
other
cases
that
the
government
refers
to
if
the
evidence
was
of
the
same
nature
that
the
evidence
hindered
in
this
case,
i
believe
it
was
error
for
them
not
to
at
least
consider
the
evidence
and
see
if
conditions
had
changed.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
don't
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
they're
necessarily
already
apprised
of
the
situation.
i
think
that
this
evidence
is
continually
changing
that
we
speak
of
that
the
evidence
they
may
have
heard
two,
three,
four,
five
years
ago
is
not
the
same
evidence
that
we're
presenting
today.
the
needs
of
the
consumer
are
changing,
the
adequacy
of
gas
supplies
that's
a
constantly
changing
thing.
i
believe
that
as
in
this
case
also,
the
government's
burden
would
be
materially
reduced
by
the
fact
that
most
of
the
evidence
in
this
consolidated
hearings
is
presented
jointly
by
the
producer
so
you
don't
have
just
every
bit
--
every
producer
presenting
a
complete
case
itself.
further,
the
commission
couldn't
re
--
materially
reduce
the
quantity
of
evidence
presented
if
it
would
indicate
some
of
the
evidentiary
criteria,
it
would
consider
justifying
out
of
line
prices.
i
believe
yesterday
that
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
a
question
as
to
whether
the
commission
had
given
the
producers
any
such
evidentiary
standards.
well,
to
my
knowledge
and
i've
been
practicing
before
the
commission
since
1956.
i
have
never
seen
such
evidentiary
standards.
and
if
i
recall
correctly,
one
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
not
my
client,
actually
filed
a
petition
with
the
commission
asking
that
they
declare
such
standards
and
the
commission
simply
responded
saying,
you
have
the
burden.
you
present
the
evidence.
we
will
determine
whether
it
is
relevant.
as
matters
now
stand
without
any
guidelines
from
the
commission
we
are
forced
to
try
to
justify
our
proposed
prices
by
every
possible
evidentiary
criteria.
as
a
result,
the
records
are
somewhat
voluminous.
admittedly,
consideration
of
evidence
other
than
that
of
certificated
sales
in
an
area
will
require
some
additional
effort
on
the
part
of
the
commission
and
the
intervenors.
however,
that
additional
effort
is
required
by
the
natural
gas
act.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
we
offered
the
entire
amount
of
evidence
that
was
available.
in
other
words,
we
tried
this
case
unto
itself
without
relation
to
any
other
cases
to
which
we
were
not
a
party.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
of
course,
we
necessarily
were
not
familiar
with
exactly
what
was
in
those
records.
we
could
of
course
read
the
commission's
decisions
as
to
conclusory
statements
as
to
a
type
of
evidence
there
but
as
to
the
exact
evidence
we
do
not
have
that
before
us.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
mr.
justice
clark,
of
course
in
this
case,
we
really
have
two
certifications.
the
first
one
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
for
insufficiency
of
evidence
and
remanded
to
the
commission
with
instructions
to
permit
us
to
present
additional
evidence
to
support
unconditional
certification.
in
that
case,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
commission's
reliance
on
other
certified
prices
in
the
area
was
insufficient
to
meet
this
court's
catco
decision.
this
court
denied
certiorari
and
then
we
went
back
to
the
commission
and
presented
the
additional
evidence
that
we
thought
was
required.
the
commission
excluded
that
evidence
and
it
is
that
order
that
is
now
before
this
court.
but
we
did
present
additional
evidence
in
response
to
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
yes
sir,
it
did.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
clark.
in
the
case
of
my
particular
client,
the
evidence
commences
on
record
page
356
and
shows
that
we
are
suffering
a
revenue
deficiency
in
the
magnitude
of
$3.8
million
even
if
our
present
contract
prices
are
allowed.
however,
even
if
additional
effort
is
required
by
the
commission,
it
is
simply
part
of
their
regulatory
responsibility
under
the
natural
gas
act.
if
they
wish
to
change
the
statutory
standard
of
public
convenience
and
necessity,
their
plea
should
be
directed
to
congress
and
not
to
this
court.
the
commission
and
the
intervenors
argue
that
we
seek
to
convert
every
certificate
proceeding
into
a
section
4
or
section
5
rate
hearing.
this
is
not
true.
all
we
seek
is
an
opportunity
to
support
our
contract
prices
which
were
competitively
negotiated.
we
do
not
seek
to
have
the
commission
to
allow
as
our
cost
no
matter
how
high
they
may
be.
we
do
not
seek
to
have
the
commission
to
allow
us
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
based
upon
our
cost
of
service.
the
excluded
evidence
was
offered
solely
to
support
our
contract
prices.
it
was
not
offered
to
have
the
commission
certificate
us
at
a
price
level
equal
to
our
cost
whatever
they
maybe.
as
this
court
held
in
catco,
such
just
and
reasonable
rate
determinations
are
appropriately
left
to
section
4
and
section
5
rate
proceedings.
all
that
we
ask
is
the
opportunity
to
meet
our
statutory
burden
to
show
that
our
proposed
prices
are
consistent
with
the
present
and
future
public
convenience
and
necessity.
we
do
not
believe
that
considerations
of
administrative
convenience
can
be
used
to
deny
the
admissibility
of
relevant
efforts.
in
summary,
we
believe
that
the
commission's
exclusion
of
all
economic
cost
and
financial
evidence
is
contrary
to
section
7
of
the
act
and
to
this
court's
catco
decision.
in
my
remaining
time,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
number
26
where
we
contend
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
commission
does
not
have
authority
under
section
7
of
the
natural
gas
act
to
retroactively
apply
a
price
reduction
by
ordering
reparations
of
amounts
previously
collected
pursuant
to
unconditional,
permanent
certificates.
i
emphasize
the
phrase
on
the
facts
of
this
case
because
we
rec
--
recognize
that
under
the
act,
there
were
statutory
remedies
which
if
timely
exercised
would
have
vested
the
commission
with
authority
to
order
reparations
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
yes.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
very
vigorously
mr.
justice
harlan.
we
believe
that
the
commission
committed
fundamental
error
in
arbitrarily
holding
that
all
prices
above
18.5
cents
per
mcf.
for
sales
from
south
louisiana
were
infected
by
the
catco
price.
we
believe
that
this
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
an
arbitrary
opa
type
of
price
were
used
which
certainly,
the
commission
is
not
authorized
to
impose
under
the
natural
gas
act.
further,
we
believe
that
the
exclusion
of
all
these
prices
without
regard
to
whether
they
were
appealed
or
not,
constitutes
in
effect
a
collateral
attack
upon
prior
file
orders
of
the
commission,
what
the
commission
has
done
is
simply
in
effect
said,
those
orders
were
invalid
and
why
do
they
say
they
were
invalid?
because
they
were
subject
to
the
same
defect
as
the
catco
price
was.
but
what
was
the
defect
in
catco?
it
was
the
lack
of
evidence
to
support
the
proposed
price.
how
can
we
show
that
price
is
permanently
certificated
by
the
commission
which
under
all
concepts
of
anglo-saxon
jurisprudence
are
presumptively
valid.
we're
not
supported
by
sufficient
evidence.
those
prices
were
not
appealed.
they
became
final
and
deliveries
commence
there
under.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
yes,
we
did
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
believe
it's
covered
in
our
brief
as
a
respondent
in
numbers
21,
22
and
36.
i
have
to
correct
myself.
i
will
say
that
was
in
the
court
below.
if
you
will
recall
in
the
brief
to
this
court,
we
pointed
out
that
the
exclusion
of
those
18.5
cents
price
is
in
making
an
in-line
price
determination,
was
not
raised
on
the
petitions
for
certiorari
and
that
they
were
not
argued
by
counsel
yesterday.
we
asked
this
court
to
permit
us
to
file
a
supplemental
brief
in
the
event
it
wished
to
determine
the
propriety
of
the
commission's
in-line
price
determination.
turning
again
to
the
issue
in
number
26,
i
might
point
out
that
neither
the
court
below
nor
the
commission
nor
new
york
nor
united
gas
improvement
company
purport
to
find
any
statutory
power
to
support
the
ordering
of
reparations
in
this
case.
instead,
they
urge
that
inherent
power
should
be
implied
for
three
reasons.
first,
it
is
contended
that
such
power
should
be
implied
because
we
assume
that
the
risk
of
making
refunds
when
we
commit
deliveries
under
our
original
unconditional
certificates.
but
this
argument
assumes
the
very
question
before
the
court
for
if
the
commission
does
not
have
the
authority
to
order
reparations
then
we
assume
no
risk.
second,
it
is
argued
that
unless
reparation
power
is
implied
here,
we
will
receive
a
windfall.
first,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
question
of
the
commission's
authority
under
the
natural
gas
act
is
dependent
upon
the
failure
of
a
party
to
exercise
expressed
statutory
remedies.
however,
aside
from
that
fundamental
defect,
the
only
evidence
tendered
in
this
case
shows
that
even
at
present
contract
prices
including
those
at
issue
here,
we
will
not
recover
our
cost
by
approximately
$3.8
million.
if
we
are
required
to
make
reparations,
this
revenue
deficiency
simply
will
be
increased.
we
believe
that
if
anybody
is
getting
a
windfall
in
this
case,
it
is
the
pipeline
purchase.
finally,
it
is
claimed
that
inherent
reparation
power
must
be
implied
in
this
case
in
order
to
afford
the
consumer
a
complete
bond
of
protection.
however,
this
argument
ignores
the
fact
that
the
expressed
provisions
of
the
natural
gas
act
if
timely
exercised
would
have
provided
such
complete
bond
of
protection.
powers
which
are
not
in
the
act
should
not
be
implied
to
compensate
for
the
failure
to
invoke
the
expressed
provisions
of
the
act.
this
is
particularly
true
when
to
imply
such
powers
could
expose
the
consumer
the
potential
retroactive
rate
increases
of
tens
of
millions
of
dollars.
during
the
pendency
of
new
york's
original
appeal
in
this
case,
a
stay
or
other
judicial
order
under
section
19
of
the
act
was
available
to
protect
new
york's
rights
in
the
event
it
was
successful.
mr.
brown
yesterday
stated
that
it
would
be
ridiculous,
suicidal
to
require
him
to
get
a
stay
to
prevent
us
for
making
deliveries.
first,
i
believe
that
it
was
mr.
brown's
decision
to
make
in
the
first
place.
but
if
--
in
addition
to
that,
i
believe
that
there
were
other
judicial
remedies
that
a
court
could
--
has
inherent
power
to
issue
itself
such
as
an
order
either
staying
our
deliveries
or
permitting
us
to
make
them
subject
to
a
refund
condition.
this
is
the
expressed
protection
provided
by
the
act.
it
is
mandatory
under
the
act
since
section
19
expressly
provides
that
the
filing
of
an
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
federal
power
commission
does
not
act
as
a
stay
of
that
order.
this
is
the
protection
which
we
obtained
from
the
court
below
before
processing
the
present
appeals.
new
york
argues
that
a
stay
is
not
necessary
to
protect
the
rights
of
a
party
appealing
an
order
of
the
commission.
in
other
words,
it
would
rewrite
section
19
of
the
act.
however,
if
new
york
is
correct,
then
consumers
may
be
faced
with
retroactive
rate
increases
totaling
millions
of
dollars.
for
example,
in
the
recent
permian
basin
area
rate
decision,
the
commission
reduced
--
produced
the
rates
by
some
$20
million
or
$30
odd
million
dollars
a
year.
under
new
york's
theory,
even
if
the
producers
do
not
obtain
a
stay
of
the
commission's
order,
it
would
make
no
difference
or
if
they
ultimately
prevail
on
their
appeals,
they
will
be
entitled
to
recoup
what
they
have
lost
by
an
erroneous
order
of
the
commission
by
a
retroactive
rate
increases.
further,
when
new
york's
appeal
was
remanded
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
this
case,
the
commission
could
have
issued
temporary
certificates
to
us
to
continue
our
sales
subject
to
an
expressed
condition
to
make
refunds
of
amounts
thereafter
collected
in
excess
of
the
price
finally
determined
on
remand.
this
is
the
procedure
authorized
by
section
7
of
the
act
and
is
the
procedure
that
was
followed
by
the
commission
after
the
remand
in
catco
and
after
the
remand
in
many
other
cases.
however,
in
our
case,
the
commission
did
not
do
so
and
cannot
do
so
now.
thus,
the
natural
gas
act
contains
expressed
provisions
which
would
have
provided
the
consumer
with
a
complete
bond
of
protection.
there
is
no
reason
to
imply
inherent
powers
to
the
commission
which
are
not
necessary
and
which
could
have
adverse
effects
on
consumers
as
well
as
producers.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
mr.
justice
clark,
i
believe
that
the
point
that
mr.
coleman
raised
yesterday
was
whether
the
measure
of
refunds
ordered
by
the
commission
was
properly
preserved
in
the
applications
for
rehearing
filed
before
the
commission.
yes,
i
believe
that
those
applications
for
rehearing
thoroughly
covered
that
point
and
i
believe
that
succeeding
counsel
intend
to
cover
that
point
in
some
detail.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
that
is
my
understanding
mr.
justice
clark
of
the
commission's
position.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
mr.
justice
clark,
of
course,
the
commission
as
you
well
know
has
undertaken
to
determine
just
and
reasonable
prices
on
an
area
basis.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
in
those
area
hearings,
they
have
excluded
peremptorily
all
the
evidence
of
the
individual
circumstances
of
any
particular
producer
whether
it
be
the
producer's
cost
or
the
circumstances
surrounding
any
particular
sale
or
sales.
the
evidence
of
that
nature
therefore
would
never
be
received
by
the
commission
in
a
certificate
proceeding
or
in
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
hearing
under
its
present
rules.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
mr.
justice
clark
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
if
i
recall
yesterday
what
was
said,
it
is
that
the
price
increase
moratorium
that
was
imposed
by
the
commission
in
this
case
expires
on
july
1,
1967.
i
believe
it
was
mr.
brown,
he
said
that
he
contemplated
that
on
july
2,
1967
that
would
be
a
rush
to
the
commission
to
file
rate
increases
above
23.55
cents.
now
i
presume
that
those
rate
increases
would
be
suspended
pursuant
to
the
commission's
power
under
the
natural
gas
act
for
a
period
of
five
months.
then
we
would
be
permitted
to
collect
those
rate
increases
subject
to
refund.
the
ultimate
validity
of
the
proposed
rate
increase
would
then
probably
determined
under
the
commission's
present
practice
in
a
--
another
rate,
area
rate
proceeding
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
no,
i
do
not
see
how
that
could
be
possible
mr.
justice
clark
because
--
of
course
those
rate
increases
would
have
been
filed
in
1967.
there
would
be
no
facts
before
the
commission
that
would
relate
to
1967
cost.
i
believe
that
for
instance
in
the
present
area
rate
proceeding,
the
test
year
that's
being
used
is
1960
or
1962.
so
that
would
seem
to
that
even
if
you
assume
the
validity
of
the
area
rate
making
concept
that
there
would
have
to
have
another
area
rate
hearing
to
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
well,
i
think
that
that
probably
is
a
matter
for
argument
that
this
court
will
hear
a
year
or
two
from
now
as
the
appeal
from
its
permian
area
rate
decision
comes
up.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
well,
i
have
no
doubt
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
well,
i
think
that
that's
right
but
i
think
that
this
court
has
not
approved
the
area
--
the
implementation
of
the
area
rate
method
and
as
to
whether
or
not
individual
exceptions
have
to
be
considered
in
the
myriad
of
issues
that
will
be
brought
before
the
court
at
that
time.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
believe
that
if
i
understood
mr.
solomon's
argument
yesterday
is
what
we
want
you
to
do
is
to
let
us
determine
this
in-line
price
that
mr.
clark
pointed
out
and
then
we're
going
to
determine
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
now
it
may
be
above
the
in-line
price
or
maybe
below,
we
don't
know
yet.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
that
is
going
on
now
but
it
hasn't
been
determined
yet.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
no,
no
we
cannot
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
yes,
i
--
some
of
the
evidence
has
--
undoubtedly,
to
some
of
the
type
of
evidence
shall
i
say
not
the
identical
evidence
has
been
offered
being
--
has
been
excluded
may
i
say.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
well,
it
would
come
up
of
course
to
determine
the
just
and
reasonable
right
but
we've
been
operating
here
now
for
a
period
of
seven
years,
more
than
a
third
of
our
contract
period
and
which
the
firm
price
at
which
we
were
operating
under
our
certificates
has
not
been
determined
under
section
7.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
prospectively,
we
could
mr.
justice
clark
but
not
retroactively.
in
other
words,
the
past
seven
years
--
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
not
during
the
past
seven
years.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
prospectively,
we
filed
it
now.
undoubtedly,
the
commission
would
suspend
it
for
six
months
and
then
we
could
go
up
to
that
price
and
start
collecting
the
said
refund.
mr.
j.
evans
attwell
no
sir,
we
have
not
filed
a
rate
increase.
thank
you
your
honor.
