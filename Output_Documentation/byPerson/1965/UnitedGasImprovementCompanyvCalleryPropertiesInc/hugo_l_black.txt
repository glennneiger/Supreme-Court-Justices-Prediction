justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
sir?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
it
haven't
mentioned
here
before,
do
you
know
whether
there's
been
effort
in
congress
to
change
the
effect
of
the
catco
ruling
and
if
so,
what
the
result
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
you
try
it?
how
did
we
try
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
notified
them,
you'd
increase
it,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
1959,
does
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
excluded
into
--
have
--
year
by
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
that
would
be
the
duty
of
the
commission
however
to
make
it
on
a
year
by
year
basis,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
does
the
figure
81
relate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
idea
--
i'm
just
asking
you,
(inaudible)
because
i'm
thinking
of
stupendous
problems
involved
in
--
is
it
your
idea
that
--
you
said,
(inaudible)
the
commission
fix
a
just
and
reasonable
way
for
each
separate
company
that
has
separate
projects
or
that
it
should
have
just
one
rate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
it
can
fix
just
one
rate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
quite
a
difference
between
the
costs,
i'm
sure.
justice
hugo
l.
black
different
(inaudible)
fields
are
different
(inaudible)
companies.
now,
what's
the
commission's
duty
in
reference
to
trying
to
fix
rates
under
the
gas
act
in
situations
of
this
kind?
can
they
--
are
they
suppose
to
give
that
those
who
have
projects
that
are
costly,
very
expensive
to
let
them
get
bigger
rates
than
the
others?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
something
--
i
was
thinking
about
the
difference
between
coal
mines,
i
know
something
about
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
i've
lived
where
they
had
coal
mines
where
they're
very
difficult
to
produce
at
all,
little
strip
mines
and
be
very
expensive
and
sometimes
prohibited.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
didn't
have
a
--
they
didn't
attempt
that
to
fix
a
rate
by
government
or
maximum
but
i'm
wondering
if
you
understand
this
field
to
mean
that
the
maximum
must
be
enough
to
give
the
most
expensive
company
in
the
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
proper
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
this
--
in
this
area
as
i
recall
it,
18
to
23.5,
is
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
pretty
big
variation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
that
brings
up
the
question
that
i
had
in
mind
about
the
other
complications.
how
would
the
commission
going
to
be
able
to
fix
a
reasonable
rate
here
for
seven
successive
years?
i'm
much
impressed
by
your
argument
i
say
is
the
reason
i'm
asking
you
this
question.
how
are
they
going
to
be
able
to
do
that
without
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
having
--
well,
year
by
year,
just
and
reasonable
rates.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
of
course,
i
guess
the
government
would
have
to
rely
in
the
last
instance
when
you
begin
to
consider
that
an
egregious
--
tremendous
variation
on
its
--
the
argument
that
--
well,
you
don't
have
to
go
into
the
interstate
business
but
if
you
do,
you've
got
to
meet
our
rate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
the
idea
in
regulation
is
as
i
understand
it
basically
of
prices
that
the
consumers
were
not
always
behold
it
free
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
that
therefore
the
government
without
regard
to
the
fact
if
you
could
sell
for
some
pretty
high
price
wants
to
cut
it
below
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
talking
now
about
regulation
by
competition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
i
suppose
depends
to
some
extent
on
the
principle
you're
arguing
as
to
whether
the
man
is
compelled
to
sell
against
his
will
whether
he's
permitted
to
sell,
does
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
didn't
want
to
interrupt
you
but
i
was
interested
in
this
argument
you've
been
making
(inaudible)
answer
the
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
are
--
is
that
here
now
or
filed,
are
they
not
anyhow?
