mr.
jacob
kossman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
also
on
certiorari
for
the
second
circuit
for
an
individual
who
has
given
two
years
in
the
sentence
of
criminal
contempt,
a
contempt
not
occurring
in
the
presence
of
the
judge
and
there
was
a
hearing,
42
(b),
he
asked
for
a
jury
which
was
denied.
now,
two
years
--
two
terms
ago,
this
court
in
united
states
versus
barnett
stated,
"in
view
of
the
impending
contempt
hearing,
the
effective
administration
of
justice
requires
that
this
dictums
be
added.
some
members
are
of
the
view
that
without
regard
to
the
seriousness
of
the
offense,
punishment
by
summary
trial
without
a
jury
would
be
constitutionally
limited
to
that
penalty
provided
for
petty
offenses.”
now,
perhaps
that
this
dictum
had
been
written
in
the
body
of
the
opinion
rather
than
in
the
footnote,
the
second
circuit
might
not
have
misinterpreted.
now,
my
first
point
is
just
as
two
terms
ago,
the
effective
administration
of
justice
required
that
that
caveat
victim
be
added
even
more
so
now
because
every
court
of
appeals
in
this
country
except
the
second
circuit
has
followed.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
the
third
circuit,
in
re
(inaudible)
case,
the
fifth
circuit,
johnson,
the
sixth
circuit,
schiffer,
and
the
seventh
circuit,
in
the
case
that's
following
in
re
shipp.
so
to
repeat
and
of
course
to
all
district
courts
and
the
respective
court
of
appeals
judicial
districts,
only
the
second
circuit
has
refused
to
follow
it.
mr.
jacob
kossman
sure.
mr.
jacob
kossman
it
is
and
it
isn't.
i
will
put
it
this
way.
mr.
jacob
kossman
it
has.
the
second
circuit
did
not
--
did
not
treat
it
in
the
opinion
dealing
with
pappadio.
it
comes
about
this
way.
here's
--
to
answer
the
question
directly.
the
court
sentenced
him
two
years,
on
page
78
(a)
of
the
record.
the
assistant
district
attorney
said,
"your
honor,
since
the
primary
purpose
of
this
investigation
is
to
obtain
testimony
or
to
obtain
evidence,
so
that
indictments
might
be
filed
or
voted
upon,
might
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
you
include
a
clause
in
the
sentence
that
if
mr.
pappadio
does
answer
the
questions
as
directed,
that
a
further
application
may
be
made
to
your
honor
to
reconsider
the
sentence
so
that
we
will
have
some
coercive
effect
on
mr.
pappadio.”
the
court
said,
“yes,
i
adopt
the
proposal.”
when
it
came
to
the
formal
judgment
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
the
assistant
district
attorney.
mr.
jacob
kossman
the
assistant
district
attorney
was
the
one
who
suggested,
“by
rule
of
the
show
cause,
let's
have
a
hearing
42
(b).”
now,
when
it
came
to
the
formal
judgment
that
was
filed,
it
was
the
same
one
as
shillitani.
not
this
business
that
took
place
in
court
so
that
we'll
have
some
--
let's
say
that
you're
sentenced
for
two
years
for
that.
if
you
answer
before
the
grand
jury
expires,
you
--
i
may
consider
a
change,
and
the
second
circuit
has
said
later
on
that
that's
equivalent
to
a
motion
that
if
you
do
answer,
you
will
get
a
dismissal.
but
this
is
a
criminal
contempt.
it
was
a
hearing
on
the
rule
for
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
would
say
so,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
jacob
kossman
no,
my
man
spent
20
days
in
jail
and
our
argument
on
the
reasonableness
is
he
shouldn't
have
spent
two
days
in
jail.
mr.
jacob
kossman
he
spent
20
days.
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
if
your
honor
please,
it's
a
practical
proposition
representing
an
individual
suffering
from
a
two-year
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
if
you
--
if
this
court
puts
it
that
way
that
they
wish
to
do
it,
then
i'll
forget
all
about
the
jury
trial.
i'll
forget
about
the
barnett.
i
don't
think
this
court
has
the
power
to
do
this.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
don't
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
mean
that
you
can
reduce
it
on
the
grounds
that
the
reasonableness
i
mean,
but
you
can't
call
this
a
civil
contempt
because
this
is
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding.
the
fact
that
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
it's
more
than
the
label.
there
was
a
hearing,
there
was
finding,
there
are
civil
contempt
involves
enforcement
of
a
judicial
decree
--
criminal
contempt
involves
punishment
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
no
--
no.
if
your
honor
please,
if
you
wish
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
say
this,
if
your
honor
wishes
to
do
that,
i
mean
i
have
--
that's
the
end
of
the
argument.
but
in
terms
of
preparing
for
this
particular
argument,
i
could
anticipate
that
this
court
would
be
that
generous.
but
i
would
love
to
have
that
resolved
and
i
will
not
follow
a
petition
for
a
rehearing.
now,
to
come
back
to
this
barnett
propositions,
clearly,
that
was
the
law
at
the
time
it
was
enunciated.
the
government
never
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
and
as
i
say
they
have
now
fought
this
proposition
involved.
now
here
is
--
i
think
i
can
best
help
this
court
and
the
petitioner
by
discussing
the
third
question
first,
the
question,
“is
this
a
reasonable
sentence?”
when
the
petitioner
was
brought
before
the
grand
jury,
he
was
under
indictment.
he
--
after
given
--
being
given
immunity,
answered
125
questions
out
of
a
130.
there
are
only
five
questions,
and
the
more
i
read
the
record,
the
more
i
see
he's
answered
even
two
or
three
of
those
particular
questions.
but
that
--
but
whether
it's
five
or
whether
it's
two
questions
or
three
questions,
it's
really
unimportant.
the
proposition
involved
in
this
particular
case
is
in
terms
of
the
third
question,
is
this
reasonable?
now,
justice
harlan
in
the
green
case
stated
very
noble
words,
very
good
words
that
they
will
examine
a
criminal
contempt
sentence
to
see
in
words
to
this
effect
if
it's
reasonable,
and
that
they
as
appellate
courts
reserved
the
right
to
reduce
the
sentence
if
it
turns
out
to
be
unreasonable.
i
might
say
the
minority
opinion
prophetically
stated
that
the
word
reasonable
standard
is
irrepressible,
vague,
and
delusive.
now,
i
wouldn't
be
arguing
before
this
court
that
this
was
an
unreasonable
sentence
if
when
he
was
asked
these
questions,
mind
you,
it
was
--
it
came
in
--
in
fact,
on
page
174
(a),
it's
brought
before
the
grand
jury.
this
case
seeks
for
relief.
and
the
assistant
district
attorney
says
to
him
on
page
174
(a),
"so
that
you'll
have
a
better
appreciation
of
the
purpose
of
this
grand
jury
proceeding,
i
want
to
advice
you
that
there's
been
testimony
before
a
senate
committee
and
statements
have
been
made
to
federal
law
enforcement
agencies
that
a
person
named
thomas
lucchese
is
at
the
head
of
a
group,
the
people
that
are
engaged
on
a
number
of
illegal
activities.
it
has
been
alleged
that
one
of
these
illegal
activities
is
the
illicit
narcotics
traffic.it
also
has
been
alleged
sir
that
you
are
a
member
of
this
particular
group.”
question
now
continues.
now
what
we're
attempting
to
do
is
to
find
out
whether
or
not
these
allegations
are
true
or
false.
are
these
allegations
true?
now,
petitioner
answered
as
follows.
“i'm
not
a
member
of
this
group
if
they
exist.
i
have
no
knowledge
if
there
is
a
group.
i
do
not
deal
in
narcotics.
i
do
not
know
if
mr.
lucchese
deals
with
narcotics.
i
do
not
know
of
anybody
else
in
this
room
or
out
of
this
room
is
dealing
with
narcotics.”
now,
i'm
going
to
skip
--
and
then
he
went
on
answering
all
other
questions
such
as
that
he
never
discussed
how
they
were
going
to
handle
grand
jury
proceedings
with
lucchese
or
with
anyone
else.
on
page
214
of
the
record,
“mr.
pappadio,
i'm
going
to
ask
you
some
of
the
questions
that
judge
harlan
directed
you
to
answer
on
the
time
you
were
before
and
prior
to
the
day.
at
the
narcotics
trial
of
vito
genovese
there
was
testimony,
there
was
testimony
that
you
attended
the
meeting
at
the
home
of
rocco
mazzie.
did
you
attend
this
meeting?”
“no
sir.”
“do
you
know
of
such
a
meeting?”
“no
sir,
no
sir.”
now,
as
i
say,
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
that
i
would
be
arguing
here,
if
he
had
said
i
refuse
to
answer,
that
this
is
an
unreasonable
sentence?
mind
you,
i'm
coming
back
to
what
justice
harlan
stated
in
the
green
case
majority
that
appellate
courts
will
review,
and
therefore
we
haven't
had
a
review
in
the
court
of
appeals,
you're
just
--
the
judge
in
levine
said
the
sentence
is
too
much
for
that
basis.
he
said
a
year
would
have
been
enough,
and
he
suggested
when
a
man
comes
under
indictment
--
under
indictment
and
answers
those
questions,
125
out
of
130
--
but
more
startling,
more
startling
is
this,
on
page
42
of
the
record,
i
said
to
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
when
the
case
started
because
the
indictment
was
hanging
over
his
head
and
words
don't
wash
away
the
indictment.
it's
true
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
trial
judge
says,
“don't
worry
about
the
indictment,
i
mean
they
can
use
anything
against
you,”
but
of
course
as
the
--
these
particular
immunity
statutes
have
been
interpreted,
you
don't
get
immunity
from
prosecution.
you
only
get
immunity
from
use.
and
under
those
circumstances,
he
had
something
to
worry
about
and
don't
forget
these
questions
have
nothing
to
do,
“are
you
doing
anything
crooked?”
or
so
on
and
so
forth.
it
has
to
do
with
the
meeting
with
the
lawyers
and
where
they
--
they
were
meeting.
now,
i
said
this
to
the
court.
now,
it
seems
that
an
indictment
that
has
been
outstanding
six
and
a
half
years
that
the
government
certainly
doesn't
have
the
desire
to
drop
that
indictment
because
if
it
did
dropped
the
indictment
it
would
certainly
influence
the
defendant
in
answering
some
of
these
particular
questions.
what
happened?
they
refused
to
drop
the
indictment.
after
certiorari
was
granted,
after
the
brief
on
the
merits
was
filed,
the
indictment
was
dropped.
the
government
notes
it
in
a
little
footnote,
your
honors
may
miss
it
just
with
one
little
sentence
you
see.
the
indictment
was
recently
dropped.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jacob
kossman
no.
mr.
jacob
kossman
no.
they
just
have
a
little
footnote
calling
to
your
honors
attention
that
the
indictment
was
dismissed.
i
filed
a
reply
brief
in
which
i
said
it
could
have
been
more
explicit
that
it
was
dropped,
but
it
was
dropped
in
january
of
1966.
now,
there's
something
else
that
--
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
i
don't
want
to
read
--
i'm
grateful.
anytime
the
government
drops
an
indictment,
i'm
grateful.
i
have
no
complaints
about
that.
and
i
only
simply
say
this
by
everything
that's
a
fair
play,
that
when
a
man
is
worried
and
assigns,
not
for
the
first
time
in
this
court,
but
assigns
at
the
trial
level.
he
says,
“we'll
answer
these
questions
if
you
drop
the
indictment.”
it's
not
fair
not
to
drop
the
indictment
there.
drop
it
now
where
it's
too
late
already
to
grand
jury,
after
we've
got
the
two-year
sentence.
but
there's
something
more
that's
startling
and
more
that's
aggravating
in
this
particular
case.
and
that
is
--
and
more
deadly
because
at
least
the
court
answered
this
by
saying,
"well,
it
can't
hurt
you.”
it
would
attend
to
the
charge
of
perjury
that
the
defendant
set
up.
he
said,
"look,
i'm
in
trouble.”
he
filed
an
affidavit,
a
sworn
affidavit.
page
8
(a),
defendant
states
he
has
been
on
his
consultation
with
attorneys
not
only
with
respect
to
the
instant
grand
jury
proceeding
but
also
with
respect
to
the
indictment
pending
against
him
and
with
respect
to
a
possible
proceeding
for
perjury
against
him,
even
though
he
has
truthfully
answered
the
questions
put
to
him
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
before
the
grand
jury.
in
connection
therewith,
defendant
has
been
engaged
in
the
preparation
for
his
defense
not
only
for
the
indictment
outstanding
against
him,
but
for
the
possible
proceedings
for
perjury
against
him.
now,
the
government,
the
court
below,
the
trial
court
--
the
court
below
and
the
government
simply
doesn't
understand
this
proposition
involved.
they
say
you
can't
say
something
on
direct
examination
and
then
say,
"oh,
i
don't
have
to
testify
on
cross-examination
because
i
might
contradict
myself,”
that's
not
the
situation
here.
this
man
never
contradicted
himself
under
oath.
this
man
said,
“i
don't
belong
to
a
gang.
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
narcotics.”
but
he
said
it
only
after
the
government,
in
the
silver
platter
--
very
unusual
in
this
type
of
grand
jury
examinations.
the
government
usually
don't
say,
“we
have
evidence.”
they
simply
ask
you
“are
you
in
narcotics?
and
if
you
lie,
you're
in
trouble.”
but
here,
they
said,
“we
have
evidence,
statements,
is
that
true
or
false?”
now,
he
said,
“i
am
not
in
narcotics
and
that
was
a
year
and
a
half
ago.
the
government,
and
i
assume,
that
what
they
said
was
in
good
faith.
the
government
must
believe
his
story
because
he
hasn't
been
indicted
for
a
perjury.
that's
the
--
sure
there's
a
five-year
statute
of
limitations,
but
they
don't
have
to
wait
five
years
when
they
say,
“we
have
the
evidence.”
now,
it's
a
terrible
thing
for
this
reason,
because
the
purpose
of
immunity
statute
is
that
society
can
benefit
by
it.
they
give
the
person
--
and
there's
a
question
but
of
course
the
decisions
have
been
--
that
it
is
a
substitute
for
the
fifth
amendment.
but
at
least
society
benefits,
they
get
something
if
it
turned
--
for
letting
a
crook
off,
a
bad
person
off,
they're
not
going
to
punish
him.
but
when
--
when
an
individual
was
asked
the
question
after
they
say,
“we
have
two
people
who
say
you
are
on
a
narcotic
business,
are
you?”
and
you're
facing
perjury
if
you
give
a
truthful
answer
and
you're
really
not,
it
almost
place
an
individual
to
think
twice
and
say
"i'll
go
along
with
what
the
government
says,”
then
he
can
be
indicted
for
perjury?
and
where
does
the
community
benefit
buy?
the
man
might
be
tempted
to
say,
"well,
if
you
got
two
witnesses,
it
must
be
so.
and
that
was
a
problem
that
i
have
to
face
in
an
individual."
i
said,
“look,
you're
going
to
face
a
perjury
proposition
--
or
indictment
after
they
say
they
have
evidence.”
now,
they
come
back
and
said,
"look,
i'm
telling
the
truth"
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes.
because
the
question
of
reasonableness
comes
into
this
particular
play
that
under
these
circumstances,
it's
true
that
the
--
the
intent
with
which
he
refused,
cook
versus
united
states,
the
intent
with
which
he
refused
to
answer
these
particular
questions
is
important
in
finding
out
whether
he
was
really
contumacious,
whether
there
was
a
willful
violation.
mr.
jacob
kossman
on
what
basis
can
i
argue
that
two
years
is
an
unreasonable
sentence?
well,
i
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
leaving
aside
the
jury
trial
portion
where
that
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
--
leaving
aside
the
barnett,
i'm
coming
to
that
next.
mr.
jacob
kossman
oh
yes.
mr.
jacob
kossman
but
there's
no
--
but
the
point
is
i
go
back
to
the
good
words,
to
the
noble
words
that
justice
harlan
--
i
have
to
address
myself
to
the
four
justices
who
subscribed
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
oh
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes,
but
it's
been
brought
out
in
this
particular
case
just
like
in
the
harris
case,
there
were
--
there
was
no
grace
and
effort
here.
this
is
the
only
man
who
answered
the
question.
shillitani
and
i
know
comparisons
are
traditionally
invidious,
shillitani
refused
to
answer
53
questions.
castaldi
refused
to
answer
any
questions,
tramunti
refused
to
answer
questions
dealing
with
gambling
and
whatnot.
yet,
he
gets
two
years
in
vain.
now,
i
wonder
the
doctrine
and
i'm
coming
back
to
the
first
and
second
question
under
the
doctrine
of
reasonableness
that
justice
harlan
advocated,
the
power
of
the
appellate
courts
to
reduce
if
it's
an
unreasonable
sentence,
we
come
in
under
that.
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
beg
your
pardon,
yes
it
was
three
years.
but
it
was
the
most
--your
own
words
are
egregious
one.
the
man
ran
away
after
a
trial.
a
person,
well
your
honor
is
familiar
with
the
factual
situation
--
no
comparison.
here's
an
individual
who
has
really
spilled
out
his
guts
so
to
speak,
and
said
i
have
--
“i
didn't
do
anything
that's
wrong”
and
these
questions
that
are
being
answered
has
to
do
with
him
looking
to
protect
themselves
against
the
prosecution.
now,
i'll
come
back
to
the
first
two
questions,
if
your
honor
please,
and
it's
this.
this
--
i
might
have
--
the
barnett
of
course
gets
a
ceiling
of
six
months.
but
that's
not
the
solution
because
suppose
a
person
needs
six
--
should
only
get
six
days.
the
barnett
decision
means
that
this
court
and
all
appellate
courts
will
still
have
to
have
a
case
by
case
analysis
of
the
record
in
order
to
find
out
whether
the
sentence
is
reasonable
since
the
congress
has
not
fixed
any
maximum
punishments
there.
now,
here,
it
happens
to
be
a
300-page
record
--
maybe
a
3000-page.
it
may
be
a
13,000-page.
now,
therefore
i
have
to
--
and
see,
i'd
lived
with
the
--
in
the
past,
there
are
many
people
have
with
the
idea
that
judges
can't
send
you
to
jail
without
a
jury
trial.
and
the
reason
i
live
with
it
was
because
you
used
to
get
a
fine
or
ten
days.
but
i
woke
up
after
i
saw
the
sentences
and
after
i
began
reading
the
dissenting
opinions
that
someday
i
hope
may
become
to
the
majority
opinion
than
i
--
and
i
went
back
to
history.
and
going
back
to
history,
there's
one
thing
that's
clear
in
going
back
to
history.
number
one,
the
historical
error
has
been
exposed.justice
frankfurter
exposed
that.
that
hasn't
been
sufficient
to
convince
this
court
to
throw
away
the
decisions
based
on
the
doctrine
that
a
jury
trial
is
not
required
in
contempt
cases.
but
there
is
a
solution.
and
the
harris
shows
there's
a
solution
by
showing
that
there's
a
difference
between
the
contempt
in
the
presence
of
the
court
and
the
contempt
not
in
the
presence
of
the
court.
now,
once
there
is
no
necessity
for
speed,
once
there
is
no
necessity
for
vindicating
the
authority
of
the
judge
immediately,
i'll
go
along
even
for
a
summary
conviction
in
a
court
trial,
even
the
sentence
is
delayed
if
the
man
behaves
very
badly
in
the
court
and
the
judge
don't
want
to
punish
him
at
that
particular
moment
even
though
because
it
might
hurt
the
defendant.
but
where
a
contempt
does
not
occur
in
the
presence
of
the
court,
it
isn't
such
a
radical
change,
he's
given
the
right
to
counsel,
he's
given
the
right
to
subpoena
any
witnesses,
proof
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
what
is
wrong
with
having
a
jury?
now,
the
argument
that
the
government
has
created,
the
jury,
that
there
are
unsympathetic
jurors
around,
i've
never
found
them
but
there
maybe
popular
defendants
and
i
never
heard
of
any
popular
defendant
except
one.
i
heard
recently
mentioned
but
that's
a
fear
that
there's
no
excuse
for
overthrowing
--
why
that's
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
constitution,
article
iii,
article
--
amendment
five,
amendment
six.
seven,
the
founders
of
this
country
was
so
concerned
about
a
jury
that
they
even
put
into
an
amendment
that
a
trial
for
more
than
$20,
you
must
have
a
jury
trial.
now,
it's
exasperating
to
feel
that
when
you
have
these
sentences
of
six
months,
less
or
more,
not
incurring
the
presence
of
a
grand
jury
that
the
judge
who
has
his
own
order
defied
has
the
power
to
sentence
you.
now,
look
how
the
--
how
the
government
defended
it?
on
page
65
of
their
harris
brief,
nor
is
the
rule
proposed
by
the
barnett,
this
is
barnett
dictum,
it's
the
harris
brief,
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
know
--
a
significant
protection
against
unfair
convictions
for
those
accused
of
contempt.
even
under
that
rule,
a
district
judge
could
summarily
convict
an
alleged
contemnor
and
sentence
him
to
less
than
six
months
imprisonment
or
to
whatever
term
is
the
constitutional
maximum
for
petty
offenses.
this
is
the
government,
that
barnett
dictum
does
not
therefore
afford
protection
against
unfair
determination
of
guilt.
it
merely
ensures
that
lengthy
imprisonment
will
not
to
be
imposed,
without
the
intervention
of
someone
other
than
the
jury.
well,
at
some
insurance
at
least
anywhere,
at
least
i
have
a
cutoff
point
of
six
months.
but
further,
a
similar
safeguard
available
for
contempt
cases
but
not
for
other
crimes
is
the
rule
that
appellate
courts
may
review
and
revise
contempts
of
sentences.
now
the
word
similar
is
a
wrong
word.
you
can't
say
that
an
appellate
review
is
similar
to
a
trial
by
jury.
why?
a
jury
would
have
acquitted
this
man
without
leaving
the
jury
box,
with
these
particular
three
questions
involved.
now,
as
i
say,
here's
a
--
oh,
there
is
something
else
i
must
call
your
honor's
attention
to,
and
it's
this.
in
terms
of
separating
as
i
say,
i
spend
so
much
time
on
the
reasonableness
and
i'm
sorry,
i
have
to
make
a
jury
type
of
argument
at
this
court
but
that's
because
i
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
make
a
speech
to
the
jury
or
i
should
have
made
it
in
the
trial
court.
on
page
45
of
the
shillitani
brief,
it
states
this,
in
the
same
investigation,
other
witnesses,
also
a
footnote,
other
witnesses
including
shillitani
similarly
refused
to
testify.
well,
that's
a
misstatement.
sure,
it
was
an
oversight.
you
can't
say
other
witnesses
similarly
refused
to
testify.
here
is
a
man
who
answered
every
single
question,
every
single
question
pertaining
to
the
investigation.
now
what
does
the
government
say
in
order
to
defend
on
the
ground
that
it's
reasonable?
and
if
birkenstein
was
arguing
this
case,
she
would
say,
“most
unreasonable,
most
unreasonable,
most
unreasonable,”
what
does
the
government
say?
on
page
13,
“we
think
that
the
district
court's
judgment
is
supportable
in
light
of
the
extensive
narcotic
conspiracy
which
was
being
investigated
by
the
grand
jury.
and
the
possibility,”
a
remarkable
word,
“and
the
possibility
that
petitioner,
pappadio's
refusal,
was
part
of
a
concerted
plan
to
hinder
the
investigation.”
is
that
what
we
send
people
to
jail
for
two
years
without
a
jury
trial,
“on
the
possibility”?
oh,
anything
is
possible
but
you
can
search
the
record
from
top
to
bottom
inside,
out
--
you
won't
find
--
there's
no
possibility.
there's
no
possibility
that
--
that's
the
end
of
it.
they
say,
“a
possibility”
and
when
the
government
has
to
resort
to
the
possibility
to
sustain
a
sentence
of
two
years
on
the
ground
that's
reasonable,
they
don't
have
anything
more,
then
i
say
it's
most
unreasonable.
now,
there's
another
argument
that
the
government
has
thrown
in
about
this
two-year
business
and
i'll
conclude
with
that
and
that's
this.
they
said,
"well,
we
have
a
different
conception
about
time
today
than
the
founders
of
the
country
had,
at
the
time
of
the
constitution.
that
time
--
time
doesn't
mean
anything,
two
years
then
and
two
years
now,
all
the
different
things
entirely.
well,
paul
getty
recently
said
that
a
billion
dollar
is
isn't
worth
as
much
as
it
used
to
be.
but
i
feel
that
two
years
–
1776
is
just
as
long
than
as
it
is
in
1966.
if
your
honor
please,
this
judgment
should
be
reversed
with
reasonableness
first
in
my
opinion
so
that
all
district
judges,
and
all
court
of
appeal
judges
should
know
if
the
barnett
and
the
green
decision
combined
has
any
meaning
that
they
can
give
out
two
years.
that
when
this
court
has
said
appellate
review
will
be
made,
that
it
will
be
made
and
that
sentences
will
be
reduced
when
they
should
be
reduced.
and
i
can't
think
of
--
i
just
can't
think
of
any
justification
for
sentence
of
two
years
in
a
case
that
should
be
two
days.
and
he
has
served
20
days
in
jail.
bail
was
refused,
but
the
bail
was
granted
at
the
time
of
the
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals.
