justice
john
m.
harlan
would
your
argument
be
the
same
if
the
sentence
took
a
form
of
a
so-called
civil
contempt
or
is
it
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
would
not
be.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
how
does
this
judgment
with
the
purge
clause
(inaudible)
at
the
court
of
appeals?
except
for
the
label,
the
label
of
the
criminal
contempt,
how
was
it
different
from
the
--
different
from
an
ordinary
civil
contempt?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
doing
--
doing
the
label?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
told
me
that
label
is
the
--
it's
the
basis
of
your
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what's
the
basis
for
you
to
say
that
the
conviction
of
felony
is
the
source
of
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
in
criminal
offense,
but
it
isn't
because
(inaudible)
convicted
in
a
contempt,
a
criminal
contempt
conviction
and
in
criminal
(inaudible).
in
other
words,
when
a
(inaudible)
it
seems
to
me
it
turns
logically
on
the
question
(inaudible)
on
the
label,
obviously
in
the
label.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
the
judgment
then
is
to
say,
“alright,
this
is
(inaudible)
i'm
not
going
to
quarrel
if
this
is
criminal
contempt
or
is
it
a
civil
contempt,”
if
that
is
the
judgment
--
exactly
the
same
way
with
the
purge
clause,
and
the
court
of
appeals
construed
the
purge
clause
to
the
jury,
can
it
be
your
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
wouldn't
be
making
them?
justice
john
m.
harlan
