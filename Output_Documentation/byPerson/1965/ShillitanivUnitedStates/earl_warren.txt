mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
he
didn't
take
the
one
year
maximum
off,
that
they
left
it
on
--
that
we
left
it
on
and
still
called
it
--
or
two
years,
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understand
he
got
--
do
you
think
it
could
be
considered
--
we
could
say
it's
only
a
civil
appeal
even
though
the
judgment
still
says
that
he
shall
remain
there
for
two
years
only.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
believe
that
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
if
the
--
if
the
court
puts
a
maximum
sentence
on,
would
it
make
any
difference
whether
it's
for
30
days
or
for
two
years.
because
if
the
court
said
you'll
be
confined
for
30
days
with
the
right
to
purge
yourself
in
the
meantime
and
suppose
the
grand
jury
was
discharged
in
10
days,
wouldn't
that
man
under
your
theory
be
illegally
held?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
wouldn't
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
the
--
that
they
would
say
for
30
days,
but
they
couldn't
say
after
two
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
if
that's
what
you
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
it
clearly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
spritzer.
oh
--
you'd
like
to
talk
right
now,
yes,
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
alright.
you
may
--
mr.
kossman
you
may
proceed.
are
you
--
are
you
addressing
yourself
now
to
the
shillitani
case
or
to
pappadio?
chief
justice
earl
warren
pappadio,
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
made
that
suggestion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
spritzer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
these
men
stand
convicted
with
felony
by
reason
of
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
i
ask
--
i
read
in
the
press
just
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
about
a
former
soldier
who
died
and
his
widow
want
him
buried
in
arlington
cemetery.
and
it
was
objected
that
he
had
been
convicted
of
a
felony
and
subversion
and
therefore
shouldn't
be
there.
and
as
i
read
it
from
the
paper,
the
opinion
that
apart
from
the
justice
was
that
under
the
statute
which
says
that
if
a
man
has
been
convicted
of
felony
and
sentenced
to
more
than
five
years,
he
is
not
eligible
to
be
buried
there.
and
the
department
of
justice
ruled
that
because
this
man
had
been
convicted
of
subversion
and
punished
--
and
was
punished
by
i
think
four
years,
and
then
for
not
showing
up,
he
was
convicted
of
criminal
contempt
for
three
years
that
those
two
felonies
could
be
added
together
and
made
seven
years
and
therefore
the
man's
--
the
remains
couldn't
be
put
in
the
arlington
cemetery
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
was
just
thinking
of
the
consequences
of
a
man
suffering
that
kind
of
a
conviction
if
it's
to
be
added
to
other
criminal
sentences,
to
add
up
to
a
greater
number
of
years
so
that
the
man
can
suffer
other
disabilities,
you
would
think
that
regardless
of
what
it
was
called,
that
it
would
be
a
felony.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
