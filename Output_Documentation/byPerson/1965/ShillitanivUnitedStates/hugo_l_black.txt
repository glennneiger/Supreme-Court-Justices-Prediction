justice
hugo
l.
black
under
any
circumstances?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
quite
different
than
it
wouldn't
be
for
two
years.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it'd
be
during
the
time,
that
he
continued
to
disobey
the
order
of
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
are
you
still
arguing
the
question
of
reasonableness
of
the
punishment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
assuming
--
assuming
that
the
judges
found
a
legitimate
way
to
do
it,
that
this
is
a
proper
prosecution,
and
the
man
is
willfully
and
deliberately
decline
to
answer
questions,
on
what
basis
can
you
argue
that
two
years
is
an
unreasonable
punishment
to
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
just
deliberately
made
it
up,
committed
to
--
decided
that
he
will
not
answer
any
question.
he
is
going
to
defeat
every
way
he
can.
it's
very
important
for
the
government
to
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
asking
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--used
about
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
are
you
saying
that
this
is
an
unreasonable
punishment
if
he's
guilty
of
what
they
found
him
to
be
guilty
of?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
they
indicate
that
you
couldn't
give
a
man
two
years
punishment
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
who
was
deliberately
thrown
in
the
court,
decline
to
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
universal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
during
all
that
time,
there
has
not
been
a
fight
between
the
legislative
bodies
in
the
country
and
the
courts
as
to
how
far
the
courts
could
go
in
providing
people
of
a
jury
trial?
i
read
history
quite
differently
because
i
think
it
was
a
very
scrambling
position
in
the
court
as
illustrated
by
the
trial
of
judge
peck
on
one
point
and
one
meaning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
read
the
brief
very
carefully
in
the
other
case
and
i
didn't
see
that
it's
ordered
there
at
all.
and
another
thing
about
it
is
the
colonies,
that
was
passed
before
the
amendments
were
adopted
which
expressly
emphasized
the
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
just
did
not
understand
if
your
brief
established
it
at
all
the
last
time,
just
what
you
said
it
did,
that
the
colonies
even
if
we
went
back
to
the
colonies
before
we
had
the
amendment,
when
they
want
to
get
away
from
the
rules,
even
if
we
went
back
then,
i
did
not
see
why
they
said
that
should
not
be
treated
as
a
crime.
that
developed
as
i
saw
it
later
when
a
number
of
the
states
combating
the
state
legislature,
had
a
fight
and
used
the
word
that
you
used,
inherent
power
of
the
courts
in
order
to
show
that
the
legislature
couldn't
take
away
from
them
the
power
to
punish
the
contempt
as
they
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
remember
which
state
it
was
that
first
asserted
the
noble
doctrine
that
the
courts
had
inherent
--
which
has
been
followed
by
some
judgment,
the
court
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
had
inherent
power
which
the
legislature
couldn't
take
away
to
fix
such
punishment
for
contempt
as
they
sought
for
it,
do
you
remember
which
state
first
did
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
maybe
wrong
but
i
think
it
was
arkansas.
the
fight
was
between
the
legislative
branch
and
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
answered
it
by
saying,
“we
have
inherent
authority
because
we
are
the
court
and
the
legislature
can
do
nothing
about
it.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
happy
to
see
that
you
do
not
follow
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
none
of
them
can
take
it
away
at
the
time.
would
you
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
sticking
to
the
old
idea
of
the
original
record
--
that's
an
inherent
power
of
the
courts
and
the
congress
is
incapable
of
taking
it
away
--
