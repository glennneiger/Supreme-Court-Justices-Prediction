justice
abe
fortas
then
you
have
to
take
the
position
about
it,
mr.
spritzer,
that
it's
also
not
an
offense
within
the
meaning
of
18
u.s.c.
1,
definition
of
felony.
justice
abe
fortas
that
was
18
u.s.c.
1
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
know
that
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
it
uses
the
term
offense.
it
says
any
offense
punishable
by
death
or
imprisonment
for
a
term
exceeding
one
year
is
a
felony.
so
you
have
to
take
the
position
that
this
is
not
an
offense.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
not
a
felony
even
though
it's
punished
by
--
it's
punishable
by
two
years.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
take
the
position
then
that
there
is
a
distinction
as
i
understand
that
your
position
would
be
--
there
is
a
permissible
distinction
between
an
offense
against
the
state
and
an
offense
against
the
court.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
not
--
not
only
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
also
a
legislative
problem.
that
is
to
say
that
if
you're
trying
--
if
we're
trying
to
find
out
whether
a
criminal
contempt
punished
by
two-year
provision,
your
preliminary
question
maybe
whether
this
congress
has
done
something
to
make
this
a
--
something
like
this
to
the
category
of
felonies
and
then
you
go
on
to
the
constitutional
question.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
as
a
conviction
of
my
part
as
you
know,
but
as
a
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
possible
--
possibly
necessary
--
for
an
analysis.
justice
abe
fortas
would
you
have
any
question
as
to
the
power
of
congress
to
say
that
--
legislative
effect
that
convictions
of
criminal
contempt
shall
be
a
felony
and
that
all
--
whatever
flows
from
other
statutes
are
indeed
from
the
constitution
with
respect
to
felonies.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
perhaps
one
of
the
troublesome
things
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
is
this,
this
is
42
(b),
it's
not
42
(a).
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
the
42
(b)
in
effect,
congress
--
but
through
the
rule
or
through
the
mechanism
of
the
rules,
has
modified
in
any
event
the
category
of
--
the
idea
that
a
criminal
contempt
is
somewhat
must
be
treated
in
someway
procedures,
by
providing
for
a
notice
--
justice
abe
fortas
why
do
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
spritzer,
why
do
the
courts
have
to
pay
any
attention
at
all
to
what
congress
says
about
the
contempt
on
your
theory.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
on
your
theory.
that
is
to
say,
if
this
is
an
effect
of
offense
against
the
court
to
be
distinguished
from
an
offense
against
the
state,
why
--
don't
the
courts
have
power
to
act
regardless
of
what
the
congress
says
about
anything?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
i
know.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
it
your
position
that
the
historical
analysis
is
or
should
be
determinative
of
this
constitutional
question
we
have
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
qualified
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
spritzer,
may
i
suggest
the
possible
relevance
as
it
tentatively
appears
to
me,
you
are
saying
that
contempt
--
criminal
contempt
is
something
quite
different
from
any
other
kind
of
offense
against
the
law.
and
the
next
proposition
which
is
i
think
has
been
established
in
the
colloquy
that
has
occurred
is
that
congress
has
the
power
to
regulate,
prescribe
up
to
some
indefinite
point
with
respect
to
contempt.
now
if
that
is
so
--
it
seems
to
me
there's
quite
a
substantial
burden
of
persuasion
to
--
on
your
part
to
establish
that
this
is
a
different
category
and
other
crimes.
justice
abe
fortas
then
you
call
that
jurisdiction?
that's
a
matter
relating
to
jurisdiction
and
similarly,
perhaps
we
call
anything
a
matter
relating
to
crimes,
criminal
offenses.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
more
--
more
lights
contained
in
the
--
which
you're
coming
to
as
i
understand
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
this
other
point
about
--
this
being
in
a
different
category
and
it's
troublesome.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
spritzer,
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
wonder
if
you
can
really
confine
that
narrowly
because
there
are
other
types
of
criminal
contempts.
how
about
42
(a)
contempt,
the
contempt
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
court,
counsel
and
the
judge
get
into
a
dispute,
what
about
the
availability
of
the
jury
there.
now,
that's
a
generalized
provision,
42
(a)
is
a
very
generalized
provision,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
that
your
argument
would
not
apply
there,
but
still
there's
a
jury
question,
isn't
there?
it
might
be
before
us
now.
justice
abe
fortas
yes
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
or,
it
may
not
be
before
us
now,
but
intellectually
and
conceptually,
in
a
way,
it's
a
question.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
may
very
well
be,
yes
sir.
justice
abe
fortas
a
controversy
between
the
judge
and
the
counsel
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
i
mean,
there
might
be
a
dispute.
