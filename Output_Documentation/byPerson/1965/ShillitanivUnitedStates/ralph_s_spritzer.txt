mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
perhaps
i
should
address
myself
to
the
outset
to
the
question
which
was
raised
in
the
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
have
construed
the
judgment
of
conviction
in
this
case
as
being
in
criminal
contempt
because
of
the
specific
or
fixed
term
in
the
event
of
non-compliance
with
the
judgment.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
judgment
of
this
kind
obviously
has
a
coercive
as
well
as
a
punitive
effect
because
the
judge
did
provide
that
he
would
enter
a
further
order
in
the
event
that
the
witness
complied
with
the
direction
to
testify.
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
fact
construed
that
judgment
in
the
shillitani
case
as
giving
the
contemnor
an
unqualified
assurance
that
the
sentence
would
be
reduced
in
the
event
that
he
complied
with
the
order.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
reduced
in
effect
--
in
effect
call
it
to
reduce
to
the
portion
already
served.
the
judgment
in
the
pappadio
case
is
in
essentially
the
same
form
and
though
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
address
itself
to
the
question
whether
the
right
to
termination
upon
compliance
with
the
order
was
unqualified,
in
that
case,
i
have
no
reason
to
assume
that
these
two
panels
of
the
court
of
appeals
entertained
different
views
especially
since
judge
lumbard
sat
on
both
of
those
cases.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
construe
this
as
a
criminal
contempt
judgment
your
honor
because
if
there
should
be
a
refusal
to
comply
with
the
order,
i
take
it
that
under
the
terms
of
the
judgment,
the
sentence
would
be
two
years
and
not
the
duration
of
the
grand
jury
which
was
then
in
session.
on
that
basis
it
seems
to
me
it
clearly
has
the
aspects
of
criminal
contempt.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
it
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
grand
jury
is
--
that
grand
jury
is
no
longer
in
session.
i
do
not
think
the
possibilities
of
purge
are
therefore
gone
for
this
reason.
a
successor
grand
jury
has
--
is
continuing
the
same
investigation
of
these
alleged
and
suspected
narcotics
activities.
certainly,
it
would
be
the
view
of
the
united
states
attorney
if
this
--
if
these
judgments
were
affirmed
in
this
court
that
he
would
be
ready
to
provide
an
immediate
opportunity
--
would
wish
to
provide
immediate
opportunity
to
these
witnesses
to
give
the
information
they
have
before
the
successor
grand
jury.
in
the
event
that
such
testimony
were
given,
it
would
be
the
government's
view
that
the
district
court
would
have
the
power
and
we
would
say
the
obligation
here
to
reduce
the
sentence
in
accordance
with
the
purpose
of
the
judgments
originally
entered.
i
take
purpose
because
it
is
true
that
the
language
of
those
judgments
does
in
terms
refer
to
the
grand
jury
which
was
then
in
session.
however,
we
would
have
no
doubt
that
whatever
question
might
exist
in
the
district
court
in
the
event
of
such
purge,
measured
against
the
literal
terms
of
its
judgment,
there
could
be
no
question
that
under
rule
35,
the
court
--
district
court
could
accomplish
the
very
same
thing
under
its
authority
to
correct
or
reduce
a
sentence.
so
i
would
say
this
may
bear
somewhat
upon
the
point
that
mr.
justice
brennan
was
raising
that
the
possibilities
of
compliance
and
of
purge
remain.
it
has
been
in
our
interpretation,
however,
that
this
judgment
has
the
aspects
of
the
criminal
contempt
judgment
because
in
the
event
of
noncompliance,
it
provides
for
a
fixed
sentence
which
extends,
in
this
case,
beyond
the
term
of
the
grand
jury.
coming
to
the
constitutional
issues
then
which
we
think
are
presented,
the
first
of
these
is
the
question
whether
broadly,
quite
irrespective
of
the
sentence
ultimately
adjudged
in
the
case,
whether
broadly
there
is
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
a
case
of
criminal
contempt.
and
that
of
course
is
the
issue
--
an
issue
that
the
court
has
had
before
it
several
times
in
recent
terms
in
the
green
case,
in
the
barnett
case,
this
term
again
in
the
harris
case
though
the
decision
did
not
reached
that
issue.
important
though
it
is
i
shall
speak
to
it
only
very
briefly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
we
have
argued
and
briefed
it
extensively
on
these
past
occasions.
the
basic
argument
which
the
government
has
advanced
in
the
various
cases,
in
which
this
issue
has
been
--
has
been
posed,
isn't
the
issue
turns
very
largely
on
historical
considerations?
we
say,
as
the
court
has
held
in
the
past,
that
the
framers
did
not
regard
or
include
contempts
in
the
category
of
crimes
as
that
term
is
used
in
our
article
iii
or
in
the
category
of
criminal
prosecutions
as
that
term
appears
in
the
sixth
amendment.
that
rather
they
are
regarded
contempts
as
offenses
against
the
court
with
which
the
court
had
an
inherent
power
to
deal,
the
point
has
been
stated
in
many
cases,
long
ago
it
was
stated
in
ex
parte
burr.
and
since
the
settlement
of
this
country,
the
court
should
exercise
the
power
to
punish
contempts
in
a
summary
manner
such
being
the
universal
practice
and
the
sentiment
upon
the
subject.
it
cannot
be
supposed
to
that
decision
that
the
makers
of
the
constitution
meant
to
include
it
in
a
number
of
crimes
entitled
to
trial
by
jury.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
was
reading
from
the
ex
parte
burr,
yes,
the
quotation
is
"such
being
the
universal
practice
and
sentiment
upon
the
subject,‚Äù
universal
and
--
in
a
parochial
sense
because
he's
talking
about
the
colonies
and
not
the
world.
he
means
the
universe
and
the
colony
as
i
take
it
rather
than
all
countries.
we've
also
argued
as
your
honors
know
that
the
first
judiciary
act
very
powerfully
confirms
this
thesis.
that
act
made
provision
for
jury
trial
in
the
district
courts
in
civil
and
criminal
cases.
in
another
section
of
the
same
act,
it
provided
for
trial
by
the
court
and
punishment
by
fine
or
imprisonment
in
the
discretion
of
the
court,
a
provision
which
has
continued
in
that
form
without
significant
change
from
that
day
to
this.
and
we
also
think
lately
circumstance
that
the
congress
in
1790
passed
the
general
crimes
act
defining
all
the
federal
crimes
that
it
intended
to
punish,
that
it
did
not
deal
with
contempt
in
the
general
crimes
act
but
dealt
with
it
rather
exclusive
--
dealt
with
it
exclusively
as
i've
indicated
in
the
judiciary
act.
that
has
been
the
view
of
the
court
without
--
it's
been
the
view
to
date.
it
was
the
view
that
was
followed
without
any
dissent
i
believe
from
1789
until
the
1950s
when
it
was
first
questioned.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
there
was
a
great
dispute
i
think
in
connection
with
the
judge
peck
matter
as
to
whether
the
congress
could
legislate
to
limit
the
power
of
the
courts
and
the
congress
did
legislate
in
the
aftermath
of
the
judge
peck
case
to
take
out
of
the
power
of
the
courts,
the
power
to
deal
with
what
was
then
known
as
constructed
contempt
and
i'm
not
arguing
that
the
congress
is
without
legislative
power
in
this
area.
what
i
had
said
was
that
none
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
had
seemed
to
express
any
doubt
until
the
1950s
on
the
proposition
that
the
courts
could
deal
with
contempt
by
summary
process.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
we
are
relying
so
far
(voice
overlap)
as
the
historical
material
on
our
harris
and
barnett
brief.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
i
was
clearly
summarizing
and
i
don't
intend
to
go
on
further
with
it,
the
essential
point
that
we
have
been
arguing
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
on
several
occasions
in
the
past.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
they
stand
convicted
of
contempt
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
is
our
view
that
contempt
is
a
--
its
something
apart
from
crimes
in
the
constitutional
sense.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
know
what
regulation
or
statute
they
were
interpreting
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
it's
certainly
been
our
position
in
all
cases
involving
contempt
that
i
haven't
had
anything
to
do
with
it.
contempt
is
neither
a
petty
offense
nor
a
misdemeanor
nor
a
felony
but
a
separate
category,
certainly
that
that
is
true
for
purposes
of
considering
the
constitutional
issue
which
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
in
the
--
our
position
here,
it
isn't
necessarily
must
be.
i
think
it's
historically
correct.
i
think
it
has
been
consistent
on
our
part,
that
this
is
not
a
crime,
where
this
is
a
separate
from
the
category
crime
in
the
constitutional
sense
and
has
always
been
regarded
so.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
well
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
that
merely,
that
merely
breaks
down
crimes
into
the
category
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
of
felony
and
misdemeanor
and
petty
offense
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
i
do.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
say
it's
not
a
misdemeanor
when
it's
punished
by
three
months,
it's
neither
one.
i
think
this
is
but
another
aspect
of
the
question
whether
it
is
a
crime
in
a
constitutional
sense.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
our
position
is
that
contempts
were
not
included
in
the
category
of
crimes
in
the
constitutional
sense
the
way
a
violation
of
a
criminal
statute
would
be
clearly
in
that
category,
but
rather
it's
something
apart.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
my
analysis
would
be
that
the
18
u.s.c.
1
is
but
an
attempt
to
breakdown
the
constitutional
category
of
crimes
into
various
subcategories
so
the
congress
for
purposes
of
other
legislation
might
indicate
what
consequences
would
flow
from
conviction
of
one
type
of
crime
as
opposed
to
conviction
for
another
type
of
crime.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
would
not
have
any
doubt.
i
think
that's
another
way
of
saying
what
i
had
said
earlier.
the
congress
could
provide
specifically
it's
a
trial
by
jury
in
those
areas
where
it
chose,
in
connection
with
contempts.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
is
a
matter
of
definition
of
summary
in
the
sense
that
it's
then
and
there,
it
has
modified
it
in
the
sense
that
it
is
still
by
the
court
through
a
procedure
which
is
considerably
shorter
than
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
and
trial
by
jury.
it
is
still
in
the
sense
summary.
i
don't
think
that
there's
anything
in
rule
42
or
in
it's
history
to
suggest
that
the
congress
contemplated
any
procedures
extending
beyond
notice
in
hearing
or
that
it
was
changing
it's
views
as
to
the
prerogative
of
the
court
as
distinguished
from
the
jury
or
the
institution
or
the
grand
jury
to
deal
with
contempts
of
the
court's
authority
or
orders.
now
that
brings
me,
and
again,
it
is
a
point
that
has
been
dealt
with
before
and
i
shall
try
not
to
be
unduly
repetitious
to
the
barnett
dictum.
the
suggestion
that
even
if
trial
by
jury
is
not
constitutionally
acquired
in
all
cases
of
criminal
contempt,
that
a
limitation
of
six
months
ought
to
be
imposed
either
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
doctrine
or
in
the
exercise
of
the
supervisory
powers
where
the
trial
court
contempt
is
without
a
jury.
the
basis
of
that
suggestion,
i
take
it,
was
the
discussion
in
mr.
justice
goldberg's
dissenting
opinion
in
the
barnett
case,
which
suggested
to
him
the
possibilities
that
some
of
the
colonies
may
have
regarded
contempts
as
akin
to
petty
offenses
in
terms
of
the
punishments
which
might
be
imposed
therefore.
and
he
cited
statutes
from
some
of
the
colonies
in
which
there
was
provision
made
for
a
day
in
jail
or
a
five-pound
fine
or
another
rather
trivial
penalty
as
suggesting
that
possibility.
it
was
an
answer
to
that
suggestion
that
we
undertook
the
extensive
historical
research
which
we
presented
in
the
harris
case.
and
as
your
honors
know,
our
examination
of
the
statutes
after
exhaustive
search
of
materials,
which
are
not
readily
available,
brought
out
the
fact
that
there
was
no
colony
which
had
a
general
or
comprehensive
or
across
the
board
limitation
upon
the
power
of
its
principal
courts
to
punish
for
contempt.
there
were
in
many
of
the
colonies
some
statutes
which
placed
some
limitations
upon
some
kinds
of
contempt
such
as
very
often
the
relatively
minor
contempt
of
failing
to
appear
on
time
in
response
to
a
subpoena.
more
than
that,
we
found
that
none
of
the
colonies
had
any
statutory
limitation
upon
the
power
of
the
courts
to
impose
a
penalty
or
punishment
for
disobedience
of
the
court's
order
or
decree.
and
finally,
we
found
that
in
the
very
jurisdictions
where
mr.
justice
goldberg
had
observed
the
existence
of
these
statutes
imposing
minor
penalties,
there
were
other
statutes
which
authorized
severe
penalties
for
other
more
serious
types
of
contempts.
the
actual
practice
in
colonial
times
we
found
--
confirms
what
the
statutes
might
manifest,
that
there
was
no
conception
that
contempt
was
a
petty
offense.
many
contempts
were
punished
by
quite
trivial
penalties
just
as
many
are
today
but
they
were
in
all
of
the
colonies'
instances
of
severe
or
serious
punishments
as
well.
we
also
documented
i
think
rather
fully
the
proposition
that
none
of
the
commentators,
none
of
the
judges
at
the
time,
court's
opinions
of
the
courts
were
not
frequent
but
there
are
some
events,
that
none
of
the
commentators
or
judges
of
that
day
drew
an
analogy
between
contempt
and
petty
offenses.
our
conclusion
is
that
there
is
no
supportable
historical
basis
for
such
an
analogy.
we
think
that
contempts
of
authority
not
surprisingly
were
viewed
with
considerable
gravity
in
the
18th
century.
we
think
it
was
no
inadvertence
that
congress
in
1789
authorized
punishment
by
fine
or
imprisonment
in
the
discretion
of
the
court.
and
today,
no
less,
we
suggest
that
it
would
be
an
anomaly
to
regard
a
grave
and
desirous
and
deliberate
contempt
where
it
occurs
as
punishable
only
in
the
manner
of
let
us
say
a
traffic
violation
or
similar
petty
offense.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
the
barnett
case
some
members
of
this
court
emphasize
how
serious
the
contempt
there
adjudged
was.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
what
congress
says?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
this
was
long
debated,
of
course
in
19th
century
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it's
a
debate
at
the
time
of
the
judge
peck
impeachment.
i've
been
emphasizing
what
the
colonies
thought
and
what
framers
thought
about
the
nature
of
the
power
of
contempt,
not
from
the
standpoint
of
arguing
what
powers
congress
might
or
might
not
have,
but
rather
from
the
point
of
view
of
showing
that
the
framers
did
not
intend
to
embrace
contempts
in
the
guarantee
of
jury
trial
in
writing
article
iii
or
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
certainly
think
it's
of
great
weight.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
i'm
also
going
to
argue
that
i
think
there
are
reasons
of
policy
to
support
adherence
to
what
has
been
the
traditional
rule.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
some
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
for
example
where
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
we
had
it
in
the
barnett
case
where
it's
also
an
offense
against

the
plaintiff

states,
the
congress
has
said
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
questioning
the
power
of
the
congress
to
legislate
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
as
i
say
our
proposition
that's
conceivably
arguable
and
was
argued
by
many
in
the
19th
century.
this
court
has
decided
long
since
that
congress
does
have
this
power
to
regulate
the
procedures
and
i
certainly
have
no
thought
of
raising
any
question
as
to
that.
my
reference
to
what
the
colonies
thought
and
what
the
framers
thought
and
what
they've
said
was
solely
by
way
designed
to
make
a
point
that
they
didn't
think
of
it
as
a
crime
in
the
conventional
sense.
they
thought
of
contempt
as
something
different
and
hence
not
included
so
my
argument
to
goes
in
the
language
crime
and
in
the
words
criminal
prosecutions.
that's
the
only
purpose
for
which
i
am
referring
to
this
history.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
--
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
catch
your
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
are
many
instances
your
honor
and
i
cannot
develop
them
here
and
have
to
--
i
have
to
rely
on
the
harris
brief
in
which
judges
of
the
colonies
did
speak
of
the
contempt
power
as
an
inherent
power
of
the
courts.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
no
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
well
there
was
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i'm
not
arguing
here
against
the
power
of
congress
at
all.
as
your
honor
knows,
that
--
that
argument
was
conducted
in
the
halls
of
the
senate
at
great
length
by
livingston
and
by
others
in
the
aftermath
of
judge
peck.
there
i
take
it
that
the
contempt
legislation
of
the
1830s
establishes
and
led
us
to
ask
the
question
where
the
congress
was
intruding
upon
the
judiciary's
powers
in
narrowing
the
definition
of
contempt.
i
take
it
also
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
thinking
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
actually,
what
makes
me
hesitate
is
the
thought
that
it
would
be
rather
--
it
would
be
crippling
to
the
courts
if
no
aspects
of
the
contempt
power
remain
because
i
think
of
many
situations
in
which
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
suppose
the
ultimate
question
is
at
what
point
would
legislation,
on
this
subject,
go
so
far,
be
so
crippling
to
the
very
function
of
the
court
that
it
could
be
an
invasion
of
the
principle
of
the
separation
of
powers.
i
don't
know
any
other
(voice

--
mr.
ralph
s.

--
under
which
that
i
can
really
replace
it.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
certain
situations
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
that
question
has
never
a
risen
because
since
1789,
the
grant
of
authority
to
federal
courts
has
been
explicitly
in
terms
of
the
discretion
of
the
court.
the
--
so
far
as
the
grant
of
authority
is
concerned,
then
there
had
been
ceilings
placed
on
the
punishment
which
might
be
imposed
in
(voice

mr.
ralph
s.

i'm
not
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
attacking
any
congressional
regulation
in
this
case.
that
was
--
(voice

in
answer
to
justice
black's
question,
whether
there
would
ever
be
a
point
at
which
congress
would
have
to
stop,
whether
the
congress
could
take
away
the
whole
scope
of
the
contempt
power
and
leave
the
courts
nothing,
even
for
the
purpose,
let
us
say
of
maintaining
decorum
in
the
courtroom,
i
don't
know.
that's
a
troublesome
question
to
me,
i
can't
conceive
the
congress
ever
would.
but
i
think
the
--
that
is
not
a
relevant
interest
to
the
constitutional
issue
we
have
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
it's
not
relevant
to
the
defense
i'm
offering
for
our
position
because
we
don't
question
the
congress
to
tell
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
congress
has
the
power
to
legislate
upon
many
topics,
which
relate
to
the
judiciary
and
those
matters
are
essentially
judicial.
the
congress
could
limit
the
avenue
of
appeal
to
this
court
in
certain
categories
of
cases,
that
they're
not
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
think
one
can
gain
much
light
on
the
question
whether
the
framers
regarded
contempt
is
carrying
the
right
of
trial
by
jury,
by
posing
the
question
whether
the
congress
can
legislate
in
respect
to
the
procedures
in
contempt
cases.
i
think,
more
light
is
obtained
by
going
to
such
historical
evidence
as
we
have
in
(voice

--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well
my
--
i'm
trying
to
make
a
very
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
there
are
significant
differences
between
violation
of
a
court
order
and
violation
of
a
statutory
command
in
the
form
of
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
sure
we
can.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
opinion
though.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
(voice
overlap)
provided
for
the
court.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
sir.
what
i
was
about
to
say
now
is
that
in
the
case
of
violation
of
a
court
order
as
distinguished
from
violation
of
the
statute,
there
has
been
a
full
judicial
proceeding.
the
precise
duty
of
a
particular
defendant
has
been
specifically
defined
in
an
adversary
case
in
which
he's
been
represented
by
a
lawyer.
the
issue
has
been
refined.
the
end
product
is
the
product
of
case
by
case
adjudication
or
of
an
equity
proceeding,
a
direction
to
the
defendant
to
do
or
not
to
do
something.
that
particularization
of
the
command
following
a
full
judicial
proceeding
i
think
makes
that
kind
of
an
order
significantly
different
and
the
consequences
of
the
flouting
of
that
kind
of
an
order
significantly
different
from
a
generalized
legislative
command
addressed
to
the
world
at
large.
the
court's
authority
has
been
refined.
it
has
spoken
in
a
particular
case.
in
this
case,
it
heard
repeated
arguments.
it
entered
an
order
directing
testimony.
it
decided
which
question
should
be
answered
and
which
need
not
be
answered.
it
repeatedly
directed
their
answer.
now
if
that
kind
of
a
question
--
if
that
kind
of
an
order
cannot
then
be
implemented
directly
by
the
courts,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
sanction
of
contempt
will
lose
a
great
deal
of
it's
promptness
and
it's
sureness
both
of
which.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
incidentally
the
availability
of
civil
contempt,
i
think
does
emphasize
the
point
i
was
making
to
justice
fortas
that
there's
a
difference
between
a
court
order
and
a
legislative
command
because
you
couldn't
impose
any
sanction,
civil
or
criminal
contempt
to
implement
a
generalized,
a
legislative
command.
the
very
reasons
that
you
can
impose
a
civil
contempt
sanction
are
that
you
have
had
this
proceeding,
this
refinement
of
the
case,
this
adjudication.
the
reason
the
southern
district
has
been
utilizing
criminal
contempt
sanctions
rather
than
civil
contempt
in
this
type
of
case
i
take
it,
is
that
it
has
concluded
that
the
sanctions,
the
force
of
the
sanction
ought
not
depend
in
whether
the
refusal
to
testify
occurs
the
last
week
that
the
grand
jury
is
in
session
or
the
first
week.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
whether
a
jury
is
required?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
where
a
contempt
case
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
it's
a
case,
your
honor
--
it's
putting
a
case
in
which
the
facts
are
not
--
perhaps
have
to
be
in
dispute
when
it
takes
place
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
may,
i
think,
but
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i'm
not
saying
there's
no
possibility
of
dispute.
but
it
is
an
action
there
in
the
presence
of
the
court.
my
point
is
not
that
there
are
never
any
factual
issues
in
contempt
cases,
obviously,
there
are.
my
point
rather
is
that
the
situations
in
which
the
contempt
power
is
utilized
and
needed,
frequently
make
it
important
and
i
think
the
case
that
follows
next
after
this
one
gives
some
practical
illustrations
in
another
area.
frequently,
make
it
important
in
our
view,
that
the
court
have
the
power
to
proceed
in
its
traditional
fashion.
