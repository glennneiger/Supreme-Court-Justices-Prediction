mr.
albert
j.
krieger
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
sometime
ago,
some
members
of
this
court
had
the
opportunity
to
state
and
did
state
that
confinement
in
prison
for
a
period
such
as
two
years
or
18
months
or
three
years
without
the
intervening
process
of
indictment
and
trial
by
jury
in
a
criminal
contempt
case
would
corrode
our
civil
liberties.
i
believe
that
that
was
stated
some
six
years
ago
and
on
one
instance
some
seven
years
ago.
i
believe
that
the
situation
about
which
these
members
of
the
court
warned
has
come
to
pass
finally.
salvatore
shillitani
was
brought
before
a
grand
jury
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
--
asked
certain
questions,
invoked
his
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
eventually
he
was
granted
immunity
and
persisted
in
his
refusal
to
testify,
once
again
invoking
his
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
he
was
directed
by
one
judge,
judge
wyatt
to
respond.
he
failed
to
respond.
subsequently,
a
hearing
was
held
before
judge
macmahon
and
that
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
judge
macmahon
sentenced
shillitani
to
two
years
in
prison
and
added
thereto
a
rather
strange
what
we
can
term
“purge
clause.”
shillitani
was
remanded
without
bail.
application
was
made
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
for
bail,
bail
was
denied.
he
had
been
remanded
on
august
10th
of
1964,
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
held
in
november
of
1964.
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
certain
questions
in
harris
in
december
of
1964,
and
finally,
in
january
of
1965,
after
shillitani
had
served
some
five
months,
he
was
finally
admitted
to
bail,
very
substantial
bail.
one
of
the
great
problems
in
his
being
admitted
to
bail
was
that
he
could
not
be
released
until
there
had
been
considerable
supplication
and
genuflection
and
pleading
with
the
parole
commission.
the
federal
parole
commission
had
lodged
a
warrant
in
shillitani
in
the
intervening
period
because
in
their
estimate
of
the
situation,
he
had
been
convicted
of
a
felony.
he
had
a
criminal
conviction
and
therefore
he
had
violated
his
parole.
the
two
questions
upon
which
this
court
granted
certiorari,
the
add
mixture
of
civil
and
criminal
contempt
and
whether
shillitani
had
a
right
to
indictment
and
trial
by
jury
cannot
be
discussed
completely,
separately,
and
apart.
they
do
interlock
--
they
do
interdigitary.
and
the
reason
they
do
this
is
because
our
very
recent
history
has
shown
us
the
development
of
a
new
type
of
prosecution,
something
which
has
not
existed
in
our
past.
this
court
had
the
opportunity
on
april
7th
of
1964
to
state
that
its
research
had
shown
that
there
were
approximately
six
cases
since
1957
in
which
a
sentence
of
one
year
or
more
had
been
imposed
in
a
criminal
contempt
case,
and
that
prior
to
1957,
there
were
only
two.
since
april
7th
of
1964,
in
the
second
circuit
alone
there
had
been
four
cases
with
sentences
of
two
years
or
one
year.
the
real
problem
posed
here
is
not
whether
there
should
be
a
machinery
for
obtaining
testimonial
compulsion.
no
one
can
quarrel
that
there
must
be
some
way
to
obtain
testimony.
the
problem
seems
to
rotate
around
whether
there
can
be
imprisonment
for
as
long
as
two
years
or
if
the
judge
feels
otherwise
for
considerably
longer.
for
at
least
as
far
as
shillitani
is
concerned,
for
four
times
the
sentence
--
the
maximum
sentence
for
a
petty
offense
without
the
intervening
safeguards
of
indictment
and
trial
by
jury.
the
results
may
well
be
the
same
after
these
safeguards
have
been
applied
but
that
is
no
reason
why
the
safeguards
should
not
be
applied.
the
solicitor
general,
states
basically
five
reasons
why
the
government
does
not
like
jury
trials
in
cases
of
this
sort.
and
of
course
it
appears
that
if
a
jury
trial
is
good
enough,
is
appropriate
--
is
a
properly
appropriate
procedure
in
cases
involving
murderers,
in
cases
involving
spies,
in
cases
involving
any
and
every
horrendous
crime,
it's
certainly
is
an
appropriate
procedure
and
can
do
the
right
thing
in
imposing,
if
need
be,
a
punishment
for
a
failure
to
testify.
there
is
no
greater
risk
to
be
run
by
the
government
or
by
the
court
in
nullification
of
its
order
by
the
interposition
of
the
jury
system.
the
court
of
necessity
when
there
has
been
a
refusal
to
testify
must
vindicate
its
authority
and
integrity.
no
one
can
quarrel
with
that
proposition
either.
the
question
is,
once
again,
how?
now
we
must
differentiate
between
a
refusal
to
testify
in
a
situation
such
as
occurs
when
a
person
appears
before
a
grand
jury
and
the
situation
which
might
have
occur
from
the
stubborn,
obdurate
attitude
immediately
before
the
court
by
a
witness
before
and
during
the
course
of
the
trial
or
the
classic
situation
of
some
kind
of
misbehavior
before
the
court
which
require
quick
and
summary
disposition
by
the
court.
our
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
--
administration
of
justice
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
no
sir--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
no,
i
don't
believe
that
--
that
applies
mr.
justice
stewart
necessarily
because
just
because
there
was
a
hearing,
i
do
not
state
that
the
court
is
authorized
to
impose
a
sentence
in
excess
of
six
months.
i
think
that
is
the
crux
of
the
issue
here
if
in
a
42
(b)
proceeding
which
is
what
we
had
here
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
--
the
court
imposes
a
sentence
in
excess
of
that
reserve
for
petty
offenses.
then
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
his
constitutional
protections.
he
was
entitled
to
his
trial
--
to
his
indictment,
to
his
trial
by
jury.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
no,
your
honor.
no.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
it
would
not
be
the
same.
i
feel
that
--
and
i
--
i
don't
hesitate
on
this
and
i
don't
intend
to
equivocate
in
any
form
or
fashion.
i
believe
that
civil
contempt
is
the
remedy
and
it
is
a
very
efficient
remedy.
the
solicitor
general
has
remarked
in
some
of
his
briefs
that
civil
contempt
is
inadequate
in
many
instances
because
perhaps
there
is
an
insufficient
time
left.
well,
i
speak
with
shillitani.
there
was
nine
months
--
there
were
nine
months
between
his
refusal
to
testify
and
the
exploration
of
the
grand
jury.
nine
months,
this
court
has
recently
denied
bail
in
the
civil
contempt
case.
in
the
second
circuit,
bail
has
been
denied
in
the
civil
contempt
case.
the
person
who
has
refused
to
answer
had
stayed
in
jail
with
the
keys
to
the
jail
in
his
pocket
as
the
phrase
goes.
if
the
intent
of
the
court
is
to
obtain
testimony,
there
is
an
appropriate
and
proper
device
to
obtain
testimony.
that
device
was
not
employed
here
with
shillitani
which
brings
us
right
to
the
judgment.
let
us
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
and
also,
mr.
justice
brennan,
for
that
sort
of
contempt
which
does
not
require
--
require
the
immediate
action
of
the
court
to
vindicate
its
authority
and
integrity.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
eighteen
months.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
that
is
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
that
is
correct
your
honor.
if
there
is
not
ample
time
and
the
government
feels
that
it
must
seek
other
redress,
it
does
have
machinery
and
equipment
for
it.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
no.
no,
i
am
not.
i
believe
that
if
there
are
in
excess
of
--
as
the
sentence
to
be
imposed
as
an
excess
of
six
months,
i
believe
that
there
is
a
constitutional
requirement
for
an
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
for
my
purposes
in
this
case,
i
don't
have
to
go
that
far.
i
think
that
i
am
faced
with
a
specific
situation
here
which
perhaps
may
well
be
unique.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
well
unfortunately,
for
shillitani,
if
a
sentence
is
merely
reduced,
he
is
in
as
bad
situation
as
if
he
had
just
stayed
in
jail
and
served
his
two
years.
what
shillitani
seeks
here
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
shillitani
would
then
have
to
face
the
parole
commission.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
because
he
has
--
he
has
a
criminal
conviction,
if
your
honor
please.
he
has
a
criminal
conviction
which
brings
us
right
into
the
substance
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
his
violation
of
parole
consisted
of
his
being
convicted
for
a
criminal
offense
on
august
10th
1964.
if
this
judgment
were
on
for
civil
contempt,
he
has
not
violated
his
parole.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
on
a
--
an
offense
for
which
he
have
been
convicted
in
1951.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
he
was
released
in
1961.
as
of
today,
he
has
three
years
left
on
parole.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
the
judgment
--
and
i
think
i
should
address
myself
to
the
judgment
of
conviction
here
--
provided
in
what
we
have
termed
as
the
purge
clause
that
if
shillitani
reappears
before
the
grand
jury
and
responds
to
judge
wyatt's
order,
at
anytime
prior
to
the
exploration
of
the
grand
jury
or
prior
to
the
exploration
of
the
two-year
sentence,
then
he
has
--
then
an
application
maybe
made
to
terminate
his
imprisonment.
this
language,
our
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
interpreted
as
meaning
that
shillitani
upon
responding
to
judge
wyatt's
order
at
anytime
had
an
immediate
right
to
be
released
from
prison,
that
as
i
understand
the
law
is
a
clear
definition
of
civil
contempt,
not
criminal
contempt.
yet
i
throw
this
question,
as
i
must,
if
shillitani
had
not
pursued
his
appellant
remedies,
would
not
the
court
have
been
barred
by
the
exploration
of
the
60-day
period
rule
35
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
from
doing
anything
to
alter
the
sentence?
that
is
the
problem
involved
in
the
judgment
such
as
this.
judge
macmahon
at
the
time
of
imposing
the
judgment
said,
"i
impose
this
judgment
to
compel
testimony
rather
than
to
punish.”
compelling
the
testimony
is
the
thrust.
it's
the
basis
of
civil
contempt.
if
shillitani
has
been
convicted
of
a
civil
contempt,
that
is
one
thing,
and
i
think
it
would
be
an
appropriate
thing
at
the
role
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
just
in
the
language
of
the
judgment
and
commitment
itself.
if
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
no,
it
has
given
a
specific
label
and
because
it
has
a
specific
label
your
honor
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
well
that
label
because
there
are
certain
things
which
float
from
that
label
such
as
he
is
--
he
stands
convicted
of
a
felony.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
and
he
stands
convicted
of
a
felony.
and
if
he
--
and
inferentially,
if
he
has
been
convicted
of
a
felony,
then
certainly
the
statutes
do
provide
that
where
a
person
is
charged
with
felony,
he
is
entitled
to
prosecution
by
way
of
indictment.
if
he's
entitled
to
a
prosecution
by
way
of
indictment,
then
necessarily
he's
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
believe
section
1
of
title
xviii
provides
that
anyone
who
is
convicted
of
a
criminal
offense,
the
punishment
for
which
is
more
than
one
year.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
can't
run
away
from
that.
certainly
if
he
had
been
--
if
he
had
been
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
don't
think
that
you
would
have
granted
--
granted
certiorari.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
and
i
couldn't
be
making
that
argument
because
it
would
have
been
a
civil
contempt
and
i
believe
that
even
the
justices
of
this
court
would
have
indicated
that
disenchantment
with
this
order
procedure
has
specifically
stated
that
this
does
not
attached
to
civil
contempt.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
my
understanding
is
that
the
parole
warrant,
which
has
been
lifted
in
order
to
allow
him
out
on
bail,
would
remain
lifted,
that
there
is
no
criminal
conviction.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
think
that
if
we
--
that
if
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
has
meaning
in
its
last
paragraph,
then
this
court
could
state
that
in
fact,
this
was
a
judgment
for
civil
contempt.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
in
this
case.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
yes.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
my
problem
with
the
judgment.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
if
civil
contempt
has
meaning
under
all
of
the
cases,
then
he
could
only
be
a
judge
in
civil
contempt
for
the
life
of
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
--
which
means
that
the
civil
contempt
terminated
in
march
of
1965
when
that
grand
jury
expired.
it
would
therefore
require,
it
does
appear
to
me
a
--
an
invalidation,
let
me
use
that
word,
of
the
judgment
of
conviction
if
it
is
actually
a
civil
contempt.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
don't
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
yes.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
if
you
said
that,
yes.
yes,
if
you
said
that.
but
your
question
as
i
understood
with
mr.
chief
justice
was
different.
you
were
saying
--
if
i
understood
your
question,
could
there
be
a
civil
contempt
sentence
for
a
definite
period
of
two
years?
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
don't
believe
that
there
can
be.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
don't
--
under
these
circumstances,
i
don't
believe
that
it
can
be.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
yes,
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
statutes
so
provide.
i
have
seen
civil
contempt
orders
for
30
days
giving
an
opportunity
to
a
specific
defendant
to
purge
himself.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
no.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
the
order
of
the
court
--
the
order
of
the
court
would
terminate
at
the
time
of
the
exploration
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
believe
there
is
upon
appropriate
application.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
well,
that
is
my
understanding
of
this
--
of
the
civil
contempt
order
in
a
case
such
as
this,
in
the
case
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
that
--
that
is
correct.
that's
for
instance
in
the
second
circuit,
we
had
a
situation
of
the
type
which
your
honor
is
making
a
reference
to,
in
re
bonanno
where
he
was
confined
to
the
federal
house
of
detention
for
men
until
he
chose
to
respond
or
the
grand
jury
terminated.
eventually,
came
a
time
he
chose
to
respond.
i
believe
in
chicago,
mr.
giancana
is
still
in
jail
awaiting
perhaps
the
expiration
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
yes
--
yes
sir.
i
do
believe
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
in
--
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
i
--
i
don't
think
that
time
is
important
in
the
context
in
which
you're
phrasing
the
question.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
we're
seeking
to
obtain
testimony
before
a
specific
grand
jury.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
so
therefore,
the
natural
boundaries
of
that
compulsion
would
be
the
like
of
that
grand
jury.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
that
is
what
i
mean.
mr.
albert
j.
krieger
that
is
what
i
mean.
if
your
honors
please,
the
only
other
point
which
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
it
has
been
stated
that
there's
a
fear
that
trial
by
jury
might
result
a
nullification
of
the
court's
command.
with
all
due
respect
to
all
the
courts,
i
think
that
a
legislative
command
is
entitled
to
the
same
treatment
as
the
judicial
command
and
a
judicial
command
to
a
legislative
command.
and
that
--
and
perhaps
an
odd
case,
i
would
prefer
to
see,
nullification
of
either
a
legislative
command
or
a
judicial
command,
the
nullification
of
one
of
the
basic
rights
assured
to
us
citizens
in
the
united
states
constitution.
