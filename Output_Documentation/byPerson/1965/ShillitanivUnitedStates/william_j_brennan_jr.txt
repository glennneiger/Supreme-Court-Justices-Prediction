justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
mr.
krieger,
i
might
understand
then
that
your
contention
for
jury
trial
is
limited
to
these
situations.
one,
it's
a
testimonial
contempt.
two,
it's
a
refusal
to
answer
questions
before
a
grand
jury.
three,
it's
a
situation
in
which
the
sentence
in
excess
of
that
reserved
for
petty
offenses,
is
imposed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
this
goes
then
to
that
situation,
i
understand
you
have
in
new
york
southern
district
at
least
where
a
grand
jury
sits
for
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
eighteen
months
or
whatever
it
is
and
in
consequence
of
which
depending
upon
the
time
when
the
alleged
contempt
occurred.
there
is
ample
time
to
resort
to
some
other
sanctions
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
primarily
the
civil
contempt
sanction
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
want
to
get
clear
is
that
at
least
you're
not
urging
on
us
any
general
proposition
that
all
criminal
contempts
must
constitutionally
provide
a
jury
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
is
a
constitutional
requirement
at
least
--
at
least
in
connection
with
this
kind
of
testimonial
contempt
or
you're
urging
that
proposition
generally
as
to
any
criminal
contempt.
after
all,
the
statute
talks,
doesn't
it,
of
violation
of
a
court
order,
the
sort
of
thing
that
we
had
in
winston
and
green
cases
and
the
rest.
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far
i
gather
for
your
purposes
in
this
case,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
are
you
--
do
you
intend
to
comment
on
the
power
of
this
court
to
exercise
the
case
as
i
recall
it
with
mr.
justice
clark
about
the
yates
wasn't
it,
to
reduce
these
sentences.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
yates
we
reduced
the
time
served
as
i
recall
it,
didn't
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
wouldn't
--
if
we
reduce
the
sentence
to
five
months
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
follow
that.
if
it's
served,
if
we
reduced
it
to
five
months
and
it's
then
fully
served,
what's
he
involved
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
the
parole
on
some
other
offenses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sorry,
i
didn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
you,
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
realize
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
krieger,
suppose
we
should
--
in
light
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
wholly
as
if
this
is
really
only
a
civil
contempt
conviction.
where
does
that
lead
your
client
regarding
the
parole
warrant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
it's
open
to
us
to
read
the
conclusion
that
really
this
is
only
a
civil
contempt
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
we
did
that,
in
your
view,
that
would
make
it
unnecessary
to
reach
the
jury
trial
question
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
wouldn't
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wouldn't
that
necessarily
follow?
if
you're
right,
if
we
were
to
--
if
we're
--
it
lead
to
--
to
interpret
this
now,
it's
just
a
civil
contempt
order.
the
annex
of
the
rule
is,
is
it
not,
that
if
--
it's
(inaudible)
at
the
end
of
the
term
of
the
grand
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
time
has
now
passed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
order
is,
in
all
respect,
(inaudible)
as
a
civil
contempt
order,
if
we
said
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
krieger,
i
don't
--
i'm
quite
--
well,
i
don't
follow
that.
if
--
if
the
rule
is
--
and
i
think
you
told
us,
it
is
--
that
there
may
not
be
a
civil
contempt
order
that
survives
the
period
of
grand
jury.
how
can
there
ever
be
a
civil
contempt
order
in
term
--
a
point
of
time,
why
wouldn't
every
one
of
them
have
to
be,
for
the
life
of
the
grand
jury,
whether
or
not
make
an
extent
--
why
wouldn't
that
be
--
why
wouldn't
that
be
limited?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
a
testimonial
compulsion,
refusal
to
answer
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
may
i
ask
you
mr.
kossman.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
order
in
the
same
form
of
that
involved
in
the
shillitani?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
well,
let
me
ask
more
directly
counsel.
does
it
have
a
third
course
which
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
gave
the
same
construction
as
that
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
kossman,
i
thought
something
you
just
said,
indicated
that
the
form
of
order
entered
here
is
the
same
as
a
form
of
order
entered
to
the
court.
they're
not
--
aren't
we
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can't
we
--
can't
we
suppose
that
the
interpretation
of
that
order
would
be
that
given
in
the
shillitani
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
again,
let
me
ask
you
what
i
asked
mr.
krieger.
if
we
give
it
â€“
oh
does
that
mean,
is
your
man
still
in
prison?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know,
but
he
spent
20?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
we
--
if
we
should
conclude
that
this
really
is
nothing
more
than
a
civil
contempt
order
and
washout
the
two-year
thing
on
the
ground
that
it's
maximum
limit
had
to
be
the
life
of
the
grand
jury.
does
the
jury
trial
question
disappear
from
your
case
too?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
gone
--
my
hypothesis
is
that
it's
gone.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
we
do?
(voice
overlap)
seem
to
have
a
different
view.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
the
label
on
it.
there's
just
the
solid
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
you
--
you
just
want
us
to
decide
the
jury
trial
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
a
lot
more
interesting
in
getting
your
client
a
relief
from
the
effect
of
this
order.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
brief
argue
that
that
was
significant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
brief
argue
that
the
dropping
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
indictment
is
significant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
you
see
there's
sort
of
psychological
approach
to
us
in
the
way
they've
handled
it?
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
reduced
or
terminated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
you
that
mr.
spritzer.
do
you
think
it's
absolutely
essential
that
we
reach
the
jury
trial
question
in
each
of
these
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
--
then,
that
is
to
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
initially,
we
must
reach
the
constitutional
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
spritzer,
does
the
government
offer
any
additional
material
to
that
which
seems
to
me
there
had
been
at
great
lengths
offered
in
the
barnett
case
and
earlier
case
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
the
same
argument
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
least
once
--
one
of
us
of
course
hasn't
heard
this
argument
before.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
mr.
spritzer,
i'm
correct,
am
i
not,
that
the
congress
has
required
a
jury
trial
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
some
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
--
would
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
your
approach
that
this
is
not,
as
my
brother
fortas
said,
an
offense
against
the
state,
against
the
court
--
the
courts
have
to
honor
constitutionally
or
the
courts
obliged
to
honor
these
requirements
to
a
jury
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
is
that
consistent
with
the
(inaudible)
if
this
is
an
offense
against
the
court,
therefore
a
judicial
--
a
matter
of
judicial
prerogative,
where
does
the
congress
come
in
to
tell
us
that
we
have
to
allow
jury
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
what
basis
would
we
say
that
no
--
there
is
a
limit
to
which
congress
can
go
constitutionally,
how
would
we
say
that?
what
in
the
constitution
would
permit
us
to
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
thinking
of
an
example
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
where
they
deal
with
sentences
as
i
recall
it,
am
i
right,
that
congress
has
limited
the
sentence
in
a
criminal
contempt
in
certain
situations
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
three
years
is
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
congress
could
do
what
has
done
in
narcotics
field
and
say,
for
a
conviction
of
criminal
contempt
in
a
given
situation,
there
must
be
a
mandatory
sentence
of
five
years
or
ten
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
your
argument
--
this
intrudes
on
the
concept
of
separation
of
powers.
it
seems
to
me
that
really
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
so
the
ultimate
result
is
all
of
these
congressional
intents
of
regulations.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
it
is
relevant
i
think.
i
suggest
that
it's
relevant
to
the
application
of
the
jury
trial,
at
least
to
me,
very
well.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
that
connection
mr.
spritzer,
would
it
be
--
could
we
get
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
in
the
case
that
the
chief
justice
mentioned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
burial
in
arlington.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
because
it
refers
from
this
(voice
overlap)
what
you're
talking
about
it
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
sanction
of
criminal
contempt.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
certainly,
the
sanction
of
civil
contempt,
which
maybe
more
appropriate
for
that
very
situation,
would
still
be
available.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
full
strength?
