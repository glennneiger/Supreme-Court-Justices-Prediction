does
the
court's
opinion
in
phifer's
case
[inaudible]
on
this
record
that
we
have
get
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
was
this,
the
second
avenue
of
19th?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
pretty
near
the
center
of
the
city,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
what
time
of
the
day
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
why
they
were
gathered
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
coming
to
or
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
object
of
being
there,
was
it
–
what
was
the
–
what's
the
fight
about
at
that
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
some
kind
of
a
demonstration
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
could
not
find
it
in
the
record,
what,
what
--
anything
in
the
store?
justice
hugo
l.
black
about
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
boycott
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
like
to
understand
the
probe
explained
in
your
argument,
maybe
we
can
get
it
by
an
illustration.
are
you
familiar
with
f
street
down
in
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
know
that
on
saturday,
it
is
pretty
bad
congested,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
suppose
a
groups
to
get
on
f
street
and
stay
there,
they
had
an
ordinance
against
obstructing
traffic,
just
take
it
just
traffic
would
not,
they
stood
there,
people
couldn't
get
by
them,
they
want
to
walk
down
the
street,
they
all
had
to
get
down
and
walk
in
street
f,
in
order
to
get
by
them,
would
you
say
they
could
not
be
prosecuted,
that
the
constitution
forbids
their
prosecution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
this
law
doesn't
cover
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
what
i
thought
you
were
arguing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
testified
as
i
saw
it
and
i
assume
unless
we
want
to
overrule
the
findings
of
defense
who
testified
that
they
were
there
in
large
numbers,
so
large
people
could
not
walk
on
the
sidewalk.
they
therefore
the
people
who
were
walking
on
the
sidewalk
had
to
get
out
in
the
street
and
walk.
do
we
not
have
to
accept
that
as
being
a
finding
of
the
court
and
based
on
byars'
evidence
like
he
said
that
already?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
wouldn't
claim
that
that's
beyond
the
power
of
the
city
to
make
that
an
offense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
then
asking
us
to
decide
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
statement
of
byars
was
not
true,
after
the
local
courts
found
that
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
have
to
accept
it
as
the
truth
unless
it's
absolutely
not
supported
by
any
evidence
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show,
they
stated
to
the
policemen
why
they
were
there
or
what
they
were
[inaudible]

mr.

page
five,

here
is
a
note
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
those
demurs
specially
in
pointing
to
raise
as
i
read
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
would
put
down
by
that
practice,
local
practice
in
the
court
in
determining
the
question
as
to
whether
how
we
could
identify,
which
count
was
convicted
on,
and
if
we
cannot
identify
which
count
he
was
convicted
do
they
have
a
right
to
say
that
he
may
have
been
convicted
on
the
count
we
say
is
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
of
appeals
as
understand
the
opinion
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
of
appeals
as
i
understand
from
the
opinion
which
you
had
before
me
at
this
situation,
that
he
had
been
arrested
according
to
them
and
they
quoted
here,
because
they
told
him
not
to
talk
to
shuttlesworth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
was
then
a
prisoner.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
insisted
that
he
could
talk
to
shuttlesworth.
they
didn't
let
him
do
it,
he
just
has
to
be
arrested.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whereupon
they
arrested
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
he
was
not
blocking
any
traffic
at
the
time
he
came
up
to
talk
to
shuttlesworth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
conviction
cannot
stand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
they
held
that
under
the
fact,
he
had
not
violated
either
one,
they
said
either
one
of
the
ordinances.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
difference
between
the
two
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
according
to
what
the
court
held.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
one
of
justice
stewart
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
that
they
had
ordinances
from
the
city
of
birmingham
against
loitering
since
the
1930s,
didn't
they
have
them
back
at
1910.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
it,
when
i
was
a
police
[inaudible]
one
of
the
most
common
charges
was
loitering
on
the
sidewalk.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
the
question
was
whether
or
not
there
were
any
white
people
in
the
group.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
we
didn't
have
to
pass
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
decide
that
one
or
the
other
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
did
note
one
thing,
i
asked
what
was
this
all
about,
what
they
were
trying
to
do
and
actually
i'm
unable
to
find
anything
in
the
record,
and
you
said
that
it
didn't
show
and
the
other
side
said
it
didn't
show.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
city
kept
it
out,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
is
your
trying
to
bring
out,
was
it
not,
that
there
was
a
selective
buying
campaign
going
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
well
the
court
sustained
the
objection
to
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
one
of
their
assignments
of
error
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
what
the
officer
said,
but
they
did
raise
the
question
to
try
to
prove
that
who
that
object
[inaudible]
they
were
trying
to
protect
their
civil
rights
and
then
one
of
the
assignments
of
errors
that
the
court
of
appeals
passed
on,
was
saying
the
court
was
correct
in
holding
that,
that
evidence
was
not
enough.
i
don't
know
the
materiality
of
it
and
i
wouldn't
say
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
alabama.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
judge
finds
fault
on
one
side
on
all
of
the
issues
involved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
frequently
as
charged
guilty,
as
they
did
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
have
any
one
issue
tried,
for
the
party
that's
decided,
for
the
party
who
wins,
then
that
is
settled.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
can
--
you
do
note
that
you
can
attribute
it,
that
is
the
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
could
be
a
do
[inaudible]
that
you
can
attribute
it
to
a
count
that
is
good.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
that,
that's
true
in
civil
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
that
differ
--
require
different
in
our
cases
of
that
principle,
the
fact
that,
that
is
one
of
the
constitutional
ground
defect
and
the
other
is
another
defect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
would
be
an
element
of
uncertainty,
i
am
not
saying
whether
you
are
right
or
wrong.
i
asked
you
in
the
beginning,
that
question,
because
i
wanted
to
ask
you
thought
we
would
be
governed
by
that
rule,
there
is
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
degree
of
uncertainty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
may
have
thought
they
were
convicting
him
on
both
charges
and
may
have
given
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
twice
as
much
as
they
otherwise
would
have
given
him.
what
is
that
uncertainty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
have
been
less.
justice
hugo
l.
black
conviction
was
affirmed
on
both.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
cannot
know
for
whatever
effect
that
it
had,
we
cannot
know
that
the
court
would
have
imposed
the
penalty
it
did,
if
they
had
thought
they
could
only
be
convicted
on
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
if
it
is
the
original
starts
with
a
$100,
because
they
paid
a
$100
fine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
in
the
recorder
–
that's
the
maximum
they
can
give
this
one,
take
out
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
$100
and
a
180
days,
six
months.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
have
as
the
same
thing
you
have
all
over
the
country
and
that
if
a
man
is
convicted
by
these
fines,
he
does
not
pay
the
fine,
he
is
sentenced
to
a
certain
amount
of
imprisonment.
here,
they
can
give
him
6
months
in
prison,
180
days
and
they
can
also
fine
him.
if
he
doesn't
pay
the
fine,
then
he
has
to
serve
the
time,
but
he
can
pay
the
fine
at
any
time.
