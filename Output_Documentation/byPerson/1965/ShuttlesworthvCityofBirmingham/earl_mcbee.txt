mr.
earl
mcbee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
would
like
to
correct
some
of
the
implications
of
the
evidence.
here
is
a
statement
on
i
think
mr.
narbit
referred
to
on
cross
examination
relating
to
what
the
two
defendants
phifer
and
shuttlesworth
were
doing
and
whether
or
not
they
alone
were
blocking
the
sidewalk
in
such
a
manner
as
to
require
the
pedestrians
to
go
out
into
the
street.
it
is
true
enough
at
page
21,
i
believe
on
top
of
page
22
of
the
record,
that
they
all
–
so
testified.
however,
on
further
cross
examination
on
page
27
and
page
28
of
the
record,
he
was
interrogated
further
about
the
crowd
and
he
said
the
crowd
of
which
the
bottom
of
page
27
and
the
top
page
28,
he
said
the
crowd
of
which
mr.
shuttlesworth,
reverend
shuttlesworth
and
reverend
phifer
were
members
did
block
the
east-west
traffic
lane
for
pedestrians
and
did
as
a
point
of
fact
require
the
pedestrians
who
were
not
involved
in
the
group
to
move
into
the
street
in
order
to
get
by.
now,
it
is
true
the
testimony
is
that
they
did
not
block
over
half
of
that
passageway,
but
nevertheless
at
that
particular
hour,
a
busy
hour
of
the
morning,
when
the
testimony
shows
that
from
50
to
100
people
a
minute
were
passing
by.
the
testimony
clearly
shows
and
this
--
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
had
the
right
to
determine
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
pedestrian
traffic
was
so
diverted
as
to
get
into
the
street,
and
it
is
obviously
the
inference
to
be
drawn
from
that
evidence
that
it
did
interfere
in
that
manner
with
the
vehicular
traffic.
now,
we
--
i
think
we
have
in
our
brief,
the
phifer
--
the
relevant
portions
of
the
phifer
case.
mr.
earl
mcbee
mr.
justice
douglas,
we
contend
in
this
case,
that
the
proscription
reads
any
person
who
as
a
part
--
as
a
person
or
a
member
of
a
group,
in
other
words
some
of
the
statutes
or
ordinances
are
phrased
in
a
group
as
such,
but
this
includes
person
as
well.
mr.
earl
mcbee
that
maybe
a
question
if
he
remained,
so
and
does
not
block,
but
however
though
i
think
the
evidence
is
clear
that
they
didn't
all
move.
now,
the
testimony
of
the
officer
was,
officer
byars,
and
by
the
way
he
was
the
only
arresting
officer.
now,
there
is
some
testimony
that
officer
rensheur
said,
i
helped
in
the
arrest,
but
when
he
testified
his
--
what
his
assistance
consisted
of,
he
said
it
just
consisted
his
being
there,
that
is
all.
he
did
not
do
anything
else.
but
when
officer
--
when
officer
byars
accosted
the
group,
and
by
the
way,
i
think
that
i
should
make
this
statement,
the
record
clearly
shows
that
the
blockage
occurred
for
some
four
and
a
half
minutes
and
that
is
true,
that
before
the
officer
ever
accosted
the
group,
it
had
been
going
for
a
minute
and
a
half,
and
the
testimony
was
that
--
that
the
officer
watched
the
light
change,
in
other
words
there
was
a
semi
full
light
at
that
intersection,
he
watched
it
change
for
a
number
of
times.
mr.
earl
mcbee
that
is
officer
byars.
now,
the
other
officer
holman,
i
think
the
evidence
indicates,
was
engaged
in
a
conversation
with
another
officer,
officer
davis,
who
was
--
who
was
a
meter
patrolman,
that
is
he
had
a
three
wheeler
as
it's
called
and
his
duty
to
patrol
certain
portions
of
the
streets
to
check
parking
meters.
he
had
gone
to
that
intersection
according
to
the
undisputed
testimony
for
the
purpose
of
conveying
a
message
to
mr.
holman,
pertaining
to
a
personal
matter
and
relating
to
a
call
that
--
officer
holman
was
to
call
his
home.
and
so
officer
davis
and
officer
holman
were
on
the
corner,
but
obviously
engaged
in
a
conversation
between
themselves
and
they
were
summoned
across
the
street
according
to
some
version
of
the
testimony.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
it
--
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
very
clearly
indicated
what
the
conviction
was
for.
we
have
as
you
could
see
as
in
the
record
on
page
138
of
the
record,
i
believe
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
shuttlesworth
case
is
set
forth
and
it
is
clear
that
they
found
the
facts
to
be
that
both
--
that
blocking
and
both
ordered
to
move
were
present.
mr.
earl
mcbee
at
the
same
time,
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir,
i
think
that
is
true.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
the
evidence
was
that
the
group
substantially
remained,
the
officer
watched,
the
officer
watched
the
witness
to
be
--
standing
--
the
group
standing
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
when
he
was
first
requested
to
move,
that
the
group
was
still
there
and
nobody
moved.
mr.
earl
mcbee
nobody
moved
at
that
time.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir
they,
in
other
words,
when
he
first
came
up,
he
requested
them
to
move.
the
testimony
i
believe
is
that
rather
than
inquiries
i
think
the
evidence
is
that
reverend
shuttlesworth
made
statements,
such
as,
such
as
you
mean,
“we
can't
stand
here
on
the
sidewalk”
and
the
officer
then
said,
he
repeated
his
statement
that
“you
are
blocking
the
sidewalk,
obstructing
pedestrian
traffic,
you
are
causing“
but
he
didn't
say
your
causing
the
crowd
going
on
the
streets,
but
he
said
“you're
impairing
pedestrian
traffic
and
i'm
asking
you
to
move
again.”
now,
that
second
occasion
no
one
had
moved
or
substantially
no
one
had
moved.
the
third
occasion
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
that
--
that
was
the
testimony
of
officer
byars,
and
i
believe
also
of
officer
holman
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
they
are
to
be
found
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
page
18
is
one
of
the
places
and
that's
the
testimony
of
officer
byars
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
believe
that
--
i
believe
what
he
said
was,
nobody
was
standing,
everybody
else
was
in
motion
except
this
defendant
shuttlesworth
who
had
never
moved.
now
that
was
the
third
time
the
police
asked
him
to
move
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
that
is
the
just
the
moment
before
the
arrest,
exactly
right
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
some
of
the
--
he
said
some
of
them
moved.
now,
the
testimony
of
holman
was
that
they
did
not
move,
that
they
were
standing
still
there.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
that's
right.
there
were
a
few
of
them
that
moved
at
the
first
part
according
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
byars.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir,
they
made
no
effort
whatever
to
explain
their
presence.
they
made
no
effort
to
contend
that
they
were
there
observing
the
boycott
situation.
it
was
not
referred
to
anywhere
in
the
testimony
except
the
testimony
was
although
the
questions
were
asked
whether
or
not
these
officers
knew
about
or
had
heard
about
any
boycott
activities.
they
said,
“we
have
heard
rumors
of
it.”
they
were
asked
if
they
have
been
given
official
notice
of
it
through
their
superior
officer,
they
said
“no.”
so
far
as
the
evidence
is
concerned,
neither
the
state
or
the
city's
evidence
nor
the
defendant's
evidence
disclosed
any
connection
or
relationship
between
the
boycott
so
called
and
the
occasion
that
people
were
standing
there.
as
reverend
shuttlesworth
says,
here
is
version
of
what
happen
was
simply
that,
we
walked
down
the
street
just
as
any
other
people
would
walk
down
the
street.
we
got
there
just
before
the
light
changed
and
we
just
about
the
time
we
ready
to
step
out
in
the
street
and
cross,
the
officer
came
up
and
accosted
us,
which
of
course
is
a
direct
conflict
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
byars
who
said
that
they
had
been
standing
there
talking
about
what
we
don't
know,
they
made
no
effort
to
explain
what
they
were
talking
about,
but
just
standing
there
talking.
now,
somehow
or
the
other,
the
group
had
augmented
according
to
byars
testimony
from
about
six
to
about
ten
or
twelve
and
what
they
were
talking
about
nobody
knows
and
nobody
attempted
to
explain.
if
they
were
attempting
to
--
evidence
or
to
exercise
any
of
the
free
speech
rights,
it
isn't
mentioned
anywhere.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir,
i
think
that's
correct,
but
now
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir,
yes
sir
that's
true,
that's
quite
true.
so
we
could
now
–-
mr.
earl
mcbee
but
i
think
that
we
have
to
take
into
account,
mr.
justice
white
the
form
of
the
statement
made
by
officer
byars.
he
made
the
first
–
asked,
requested
for
them
to
move
and
told
them
that
they
were
obstructing
traffic.
he
said
that
he
informed
them
after
the
first
occasion,
when
shuttlesworth
said
“you
mean
to
say
we
can't
stand
on
the
sidewalk.
he
said,
“i
said
nothing
in
return.”
i
won't
hesitate
again
short
time
after
third
and
last
time,
no
this
was
a
third
time.
now,
the
second
time,
he
says,
“i
waited
for
a
short
time
and
told
them
--
informed
them
again
they
would
have
to
move
and
not
obstruct
the
sidewalk
and
allow
free
passage
for
the
pedestrians
east
and
west”
at
which
time
the
defendant
asked
“you
mean
you
can't
stand
here
on
the
sidewalk.”
and
the
third
time,
he
told
them,
he
says
“i'm
informing
you
for
the
third
and
last
time
that
i'll
have
to
move
you
--
i'll
have
to
arrest
you
unless
you
clear
the
sidewalk,
which
you're
obstructing.”
so,
i
would
assume
that
the
inference
is
that
they
were
still
there
in
sufficient
numbers.
mr.
earl
mcbee
in
shuttlesworth
case,
yes
it
was
and
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief,
the
relevant
part
of
the
phifer
case,
which
clearly
indicates
the
point
of
clearance
between
the
two
cases.
on
page
32
of
our
brief,
on
page
33,
we
have
quoted
at
length
the
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
phifer
case
and
also
we
have
quoted
on
page
33
at
length
from
the
testimony
which
indicates
that
as
a
matter
of
truth
in
fact,
the
arrest
actually
was
not
predicated
upon
the
traffic
situation,
but
as
the
court
of
appeals
says
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
reading
the
record
that
clearly
the
arrest
occurred
because
phifer
came
back.
he
had
disappeared
so
byars
said
and
came
back
after
having
disappeared
and
was
arrested
or
rather
he
was
first
warned
to
move
on
and
leave
the
presence
of
reverend
shuttlesworth.
but,
he
did
not
do
so
and
was
warned
i
think
three
times
according
to
the
testimony
as
set
forth
here,
and
the
third
time
the
arrest
was
made
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
--
and
concluded
that
the
arrest
did
not
relate
to
moving
on
or
failed
to
move
on
in
response
to
the
direction
of
an
officer
when
obstructing
traffic,
and
did
not
relate
to
any
situation
that
could
in
anyway
involve
vehicular
traffic
and
so
therefore
his
conviction
was
reversed.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
the
point
that
i
believe
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
both
are
traffic
statutes,
both
are
traffic
regulations
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
1142,
and
that
involves
under
its
terms
of
blocking
or
obstructing
traffic
on
the
street
or
sidewalk
and
fail
to
move
on
when
requested
to
do
so
by
a
police
officer.
mr.
earl
mcbee
1142
is
broad
enough
perhaps
to
include
regular
traffic,
but
it
does
not
specifically
say
so,
and
i'm
not
aware
of
having
so
been
construed
but
it
does
cover,
it
says
streets
and
sidewalks.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
ordinance
itself,
in
its
own
space
reads
streets
and
sidewalks
are
to
be
kept
open
for
free
passage
that's
entitlement
of
1142.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
it
is
our
contention
it
would
not
sir.
we
have
covered
that
or
tried
to
cover
it
in
the
last
portion
of
our
brief
and
our
argument
there
is
that
the
stromberg
and
other
cases
that
are
referred
to
in
the
brief
for
the
petitioner
relate
to
the
matter,
of
declaring
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance
or
statute
involved.
it
is
our
contention
that
at
most
a
reversal
of
1231
conviction
would
--
and
by
the
way
of
course
i
must
explain
here
that
there
was
only
one
--
one
sentence
and
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
only
one
sentence
and
he
was
in
effect
i
think
convicted
on
both
counts,
yes.
mr.
earl
mcbee
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
now,
our
point
here
is
this
that
actually
the
1231
ordinance
was
not
within
itself
tested
for
its
constitutionality.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
brief,
i
believe
that
the
petitioners
say
that
that
they
have
in
effect
that
they
--
that
they
realize
that
it
has
been
so
narrowly
construed
as
to
relate
to
those
situations
involving
or
relating
to
vehicular
traffic
that
they
had
no
desire
to
argue
further
about
the
unconstitutionality
of
it.
they
said
if
it
had
not
been
so
construed,
then
they
would
then
contend
it
had
the
same
infirmities
as
they
say
1142
had.
but
the
court
of
appeals
in
both
cases
found
that
they
did
not
reach
the
constitutionality
of
1231,
and
petitioner's
brief
concedes
that
to
be
the
case
and
closes
that
little
quotation
in
that
regard
with
a
statement
that
it's
immaterial
anyway
whether
it
is
–
whether
it
is
good
or
bad
or
whether
it
did
reach
and
didn't
reach
it
because
of
the
1142
is
the
dispositive
of
this
particular
case,
and
so
we
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
question
of
constitutionality
of
the
1231.
we
do
not
mean
to
concede
that
it
would
have
been
unconstitutional
had
they've
reached
it,
but
they
did
say
that
it
related
to
vehicular
traffic
and
as
such
in
a
later
case,
the
shelton
case,
i
believe
some
of
the
court
felt
that
in
vehicular
traffic
situations,
there
should
be
some
assumption
in
favor
of
the
validity
of
the
direction
of
the
traffic
officer
or
the
police
officer
and
that
it
should
not
be
set
apart
or
aside
or
reversed
unless
there
was
some
evidence
presented
to
show
that
they
obstruct
arbitrarily.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir,
i
have
intended
to
continue
in
that
argument.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
have
made
this
statement
and
perhaps
i
didn't
make
it
clear,
but
we
have
construed
the
decisions
stromberg
of
course
and
other
cases
which
were
relied
upon
by
the
petitioner
in
this
argument
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
several
different
acts
that
are
statutes
or
ordinances
that
might
be
involved
and
in
our
case
we
do
not
have
anything
although
so
far
as
i
can
see
except
a
question
of
lack
of
evidence,
if
this
court
should
so
find.
now,
we
say
first
that
there
is
no
lack
of
evidence
because
it
is
obvious
that
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
position
that
evidence
of
forcing
pedestrians
into
the
street
made
of
this
situation
a
matter
involving
vehicular
traffic.
now,
that
is
the
fair
inference
that
we
take
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
and
we
believe
that
it
is
the
fair
inference
that
should
be
taken
from
the
evidence
as
byars
indicates.
further,
we
say
that
if
it
is
just
merely,
if
it
is
just
merely
a
question
of
no
evidence
or
lack
of
evidence,
and
that's
the
--
that's
the
heart
of
it
as
we
see
it,
then
the
case
is
as
we
understand
them,
federal
and
state
of
when
a
summon
is
exacted
which
is
not
broader
than
would
be
substantiated
by
one
count,
the
fact
that
there
are
two
counts
in
the
case
and
one
of
them
is
bad
does
not
mean
that
the
verdict
will
not
stand
or
the
decision
will
not
stand
on
the
good
count.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
think,
i
think
it
would
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir,
they
always
do
invariably
applied
to
that
situation
when
of
course
if
they
--
if
the
sentence
was
so
great
that
it
could
not
be
supported
on
one
count.
for
example,
if
the
sentence
had
been,
we
will
say,
180
days,
plus
180
days
or
say
it
had
been
270
plus
fine,
then
it
would
be
obvious
that
you
would
have
to
rest
your
conviction
upon
the
bad
count
and
it
would
not
--
that
rule
would
not
be
applied.
but
when
only
one
--
when
only
one
sentence
is
imposed
and
the
reason
for
that
either
is
that
there
is
one
bad
count
and
one
good
count.
if
you
disassociate
it
from
the
question
of
constitutionality,
and
i
believe
that
the
stromberg
case,
carlson
and
the
other
cases
would
perhaps
be
cases
in
point
if
you
were
aiming
at
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance
in
question,
but
as
we
say
here,
apparently
there
is
no
effort
--
serious
effort
made
on
the
part
of
petitioner
to
argue
that
1231
was
unconstitutional
as
it
was
construed
and
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
earl
mcbee
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no,
he
made
no
serious
effort
to
claim
that
1231
that
was
unconstitutional
is
what
i
tried
to
say,
i
meant
to
say
in
the
brief,
in
the
briefs
is
filed
in
this
court.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well
he
–-
mr.
earl
mcbee
if
i
understood
it,
if
i
understood
him,
i
think
that
what
he
says
is,
i
mean,
maybe,
i
misread
his
statement,
but
he
says
that
he
deals
with
it
in
this
way.
he
says
that
both
for
the
fact
that
this
construction
has
been
placed
upon
it
by
the
court
of
appeals
we
would
argue
that
these
other
grounds
would
apply,
but
they
don't
argue,
that
--
that
i
think
is
his
position.
we
have
quoted
--
we
have
quoted
in
one
of
our
footnotes,
the
particular
point
of
his
brief
on
that
particular
question.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir
but
now
here
is
--
here
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
mr.
justice
black.
they
said
that
there
were
two
reasons,
that
they
did
not
reach
the
consideration
of
the
1231
under
these
demurs.
number
one,
if
the
court
will
observe
each
of
the
ground
of
demur
relate
to
and
embrace
not
just
one
of
the
constitutional
provision
of
the
statutes,
but
both
statutes.
now
under
our
alabama
principle
or
theory
or
practice
in
relation
to
demurrers,
each
demurrer
is
a
unit
to
itself,
and
the
ground
of
demurrer
of
course
being
all
embracing
covered
too
much
territory,
it
covered
both
1142
and
1231
and
was
addressed
therefore
to
the
entire
complaint,
and
not
to
each
attempt.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
so
held.
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
fact
mr.
justice
white
that
the
conviction
was
a
general
conviction
where
there
were
two
counts
in
the
complaint,
that
would
have
to
be
the
construction,
that
would
have
to
be
placed
upon
in
my
judgment,
i
think
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir,
i
think
the
only
way
--
it
could
have
been
either
one,
but
we'll
say
that
we
couldn't
tell
which,
i
mean
we
will
concede
that's
true.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir,
that
you
could
not
tell
which
it
was,
that's
correct.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
i
think
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
i
think
you
would
have
to
assume
from
the
record
that
he
was
convicted
of
both.
i
think
he
was.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
no
i
think
the,
i
think
the
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
i've
possibly
made
an
erroneous
statement,
what
i
have
meant
to
say
is
that
this
court
will
have
to
take
the
position
that
the
record
does
not
clearly
show
which
of
the
two
counts
he
was
convicted
upon
or
for
that
matter
that
he
was
convicted
on
both
in
other
words,
i
think
you
would
have
to
have
to
assume
that
that
is
true.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
i
think
of
course
if
the
court
should
reverse
on
the
theory
that
either
one
of
the
sections
under
which
he
was
convicted
was
unconstitutional,
i
think
that
would
have
to
be
reversed,
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
if
you
couldn't
tell
which
one
he
was
tried
on,
yes.
mr.
earl
mcbee
one
or
the
other?
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well
actually,
the
court
did
find
with
reference
to
1142,
they
did
discuss,
the
court
did
discuss
the
constitutional
question
in
that
case.
mr.
earl
mcbee
never
did
they
expressly
say,
no
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
i
would
think
it
would
have
to
be
sent
back,
yes
sir
that
would
be
true,
if
that
was
the
finding
of
this
court.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
the
court
of
appeals
actually
influentially
affirmed
on
both,
but
they
did
not
discuss
the
constitutional
question
as
to
1231.
they
felt
like
under
the
rules
of
practice
of
the
state
court,
that
was
not
before
them,
and
there
was
another
point
mr.
justice
black
you
asked
the
question
a
moment
ago,
whether
or
not
that
was
before
the
court
and
whether
or
not
this
court
would
be
free
to
ignore
the
rule
of
practice.
i
think
that
it
depends
--
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
it
depends
upon
the
fairness
of
the
rule
of
practice
and
whether
or
not
it
is
fairly
implied
and
whether
or
not
it
is
actually
a
rule
that
knows
no
exceptions,
but
it
has
been
universally
and
uniformly
applied
through
the
years,
but
i
think
if
the
court,
if
the
alabama
court
should
vary
from
it's
previous
decisions
and
come
up
with
a
new
rule,
which
they
say
will
not
permit
us
to
bring
this
question,
then
this
court
with
doubt
will
look
into
that
and
say
that
you
can't
stand
on
some
fanciful
new
rule
to
avoid
the
constitution
question
being
attempted.
mr.
earl
mcbee
unless
they
thought
they
would
entirely
be
convicted
on
both
counts,
i
believe
that's
a
fair
interpretation.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir,
i
think
that's
fair,
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir,
there
are
two
charges
though,
the
two
counts,
that's
the
thing,
that's
exactly
why
i
said
a
while
ago
that
the
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
i
think
that
is
the
fair
inference
to
be
drawn,
yes
sir,
i
surely
do.
i
believe
that's
right.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir,
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
white
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
what
i
say
is
that
the
inference
is
clearly
that
the
trial
court
found
guilty
on
charge
of
complaint
which
have
been
in
both
counts,
yes
and
the
second
court,
i
mean
the
court
of
appeal
to
affirm
and
they
did
not
deal
with
the
constitutionality
of
1231,
they
did
with
1142.
they
held
as
we
interpret
their
finding
a
fact
that
the
evidence
was
broaden
up
and
when
you
contrast
the
holding
in
phifer
that
the
evidence
was
broad
enough
to
cover
both
counts,
that
is
both
the
vehicular
traffic
on
the
theory
of
getting
into
the
street
plus
also
the
traffic
on
the
street
that
is
the
blocking
of
the
street
and
the
failure
to
move
on
after
having
been
requested
to
do
so
by
the
police
officer.
mr.
earl
mcbee
mr.
chief
justice
the
point
here
now
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
position.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
the
only
thing,
the
only
thing--
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
of
course
he
did,
he
did
finally
move
for
one
thing
and
disappeared
as
also
byars
testified,
but
actually
in
point
of
fact
what
he
was
arrested
for
was
coming
back
to
the
scene
after
reverend
shuttlesworth
was
arrested.
that
was
the
crime
he
actually
committed
according
to
the
arrest.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
the
court
said
he
didn't
commit
any
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
court
said
he
committed
none.
he
was
--
that's
why.
mr.
earl
mcbee
oh!
the
trial
court.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
the
trial
court
i
presume
thought
that
he
was
still
a
member
of
the
group
that
was
blocking
the
traffic
and
was
for
that
reason
entitled
to
be
convicted
i
suppose.
i
have
no
way
of
knowing,
i
mean
he
didn't
say.
mr.
earl
mcbee
you
mean,
as
to
phifer.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir,
but
the
court
of
appeals
has
dispensed
with
that
question
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
this,
the
court
of
appeals
construed
the
evidence
to
mean
that
he
was
never
arrested
for
that.
he
was
never
arrested
for
that.
he
was
arrested
according
to
that
view
point
for
coming
back
not
for
the
original
set
of
circumstances
out
of
which
mr.
shuttlesworth
was
arrested,
but
for
the
fact
he
came
back.
mr.
earl
mcbee
he
found
guilty.
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
trial
court
found
him
guilty.
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
trial
court
found
guilty,
correct
yes,
that's
true.
the
trial
court
found
him
guilty.
but
as
i
say,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
agree
at
all
with
that,
because
they
said
the
byars
was
clearly,
was
contrary
to
that
view.
there
was
another
word
to
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
facts
entirely
or
differently
in
the
two
cases.
and
in
the
phifer
case,
they
said
that
he
did
not
do
anything
at
the
time
he
was
arrested,
except
refused
to
move
away
from
shuttlesworth
which
was
not
--
which
was
not
related
to
traffic
and
nobody
contented
it
was,
not
even
officer
byars.
in
other
words,
the
trial
court
may
have
made
a
mistake,
but
if
so,
that
mistake
was
corrected
by
the
circuit
court,
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
is
no
longer
as
i
see
it
in
this
court.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir,
that's
right.
it's
clear,
that
he
--
that
if
the
officer
had
been
arresting
him
for
the
original
blocking
and
obstructing,
he
should
have
arrested
him
when
the
man
first
walked
up
and
said
you're
under
arrest
for
participating
in
this
blocking
and
obstructing,
but
he
didn't
do
it.
he
said
move
away,
go
ahead,
get
away
from
here.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
i
think
he
said
that
phifer
had
disappeared
and
gotten
away
and
he
didn't
know
how
to
find
him
while
he
was
engaged
in
arresting
reverend
shuttlesworth,
he
did
not
know
where
phifer
was.
but
the
point
is
though
certainly
when
he
first
walked
back,
when
he
came
back
to
the
scene,
if
he
were
being
arrested
for
the
offense
that
he
originally
was
said
to
have
been
involved
in,
he
should
have
been
arrested
immediately
when
he
walked
up
that
you
are
under
arrest
for
participating
in
this
blocking,
but
that
was
not
the
case.
he
was
not
under
arrest.
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
complaint,
yes,
the
complaint
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
he
was
tried
–-
mr.
earl
mcbee
you
mean
the
trial
court?
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
i
think
it's
just
a
question
of
his
erroneously
being
arrested
and
his
erroneously
being
convicted
and
the
court
of
appeals
cleared
it
up
and
said
so,
that
he
was
wrongly
arrested.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir.
they
certainly
just
didn't
have
anything
there,
because
you
didn't
arrest
him
of
what
you
charged
him
with,
so
you
have
to
remove,
and
that's
what
they
did.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
surely,
yes
sir,
right.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
right,
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
earl
mcbee
that
is
the
difference.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir,
yes
sir,
that
is
exactly.
they
said
reverend
shuttlesworth
violated
them
and
phifer
did
not.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir
he
was
there
and
at
what
point
he
moved,
i
don't
know.
mr.
earl
mcbee
he
had
been
there,
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
at
the
very
time
of
the
arrest,
i
would
not
say,
because
the
officer
said
that
at
that
time
either
the
other
members
of
the
group
had
moved
or
were
in
the
process
of
moving
except
reverend
shuttlesworth,
the
third
time.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
i
think
he
had.
he
had,
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
i
looked
into
that,
i
believe
since
1930
or
possibly
earlier.
mr.
earl
mcbee
30
or
more
years
yes,
sir
many
years.
mr.
earl
mcbee
there
have
been
some,
not
a
greater
amount.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
of
course
they
say
that.
mr.
earl
mcbee
so
far
as
i
know,
that's
correct.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
i
am
quite
sure.
i
have
been
associated
with
the
city
for
some
years
both
presently
and
formerly
and
we
have
had
some
convictions
on
that,
but
i
would
say
it
has
not
been
a
common
sort
of
a
violation.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
what
i
was
trying
to
say
mr.
justice
black
was
that
i
have
checked
it
back
that
far,
it
goes
back
at
least
that
far
and
maybe
further.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir,
we
have
had
it
for
many
years.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
no
i
think
the
ordinance
has
presently
worded,
it
is
pretty
well
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
believe
the
evidence
does
not
show
the
exact
width
of
the
sidewalk.
however,
i
would
just
estimate
probably
10
to
12-feet
wide,
just
an
estimate.
mr.
earl
mcbee
he
had
been
to
the
federal
building
which
is
on
19th
and
5th
avenue
and
he
was
on
19th
and
2nd
avenue
which
was
some
three
or
four
blocks.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
would
not
be
able
to
say
for
sure.
i
think
that
is
probably
correct.
mr.
earl
mcbee
he
may
have
said
that.
mr.
earl
mcbee
he
may
have
said
that
and
i
am
not
sure
now,
there
was
an
occasion,
there
was
an
occasion
of
that
kind
that
did
occur.
mr.
earl
mcbee
there
was,
i
think
maybe
to
clarify,
there
was
more
than
one
hearing
in
the
matter
before
the
district
court.
and
i
think
possibly
on
this
occasion
nothing
happened
on
district
court
except
that
they
reported
and
the
matter
was
continued
or
something
like
that.
but
certainly,
no
evidence
that
it
was
the
day
could
have
been.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
oh
yes
sir,
there
have
been,
but
no
appeal
so
far
as
i
know
that
went
to
our
appellate
courts.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
i
don't
know
sir,
i
couldn't
answer
that.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
of
hand,
i
just
couldn't
say,
i
mean
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
that
could
be,
i
mean
that
it
maybe
that
could
be
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir,
it's
not
a
court
of
record,
no
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
there
would
be
no
way
of
really,
i
mean
--
of
really
determining
the
facts
of
any
given
case,
there
would
be
no
way
that
i
know
of.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
if
the
petitioner
says
that's
true
and
so
far
as
i
know
it
is,
it
could
be,
i
certainly
don't
know
anything
on
the
contrary.
mr.
earl
mcbee
that's
correct,
other
than
--
it
may
have
been,
now
i
must
explain
this
too
under
our
procedure,
the
conviction
from
the
recorder's
court
is
appealed
to
the
circuit
court.
mr.
earl
mcbee
there
is
trial
de
novo
there.
mr.
earl
mcbee
that
is
a
court
of
record,
but
there
is
no,
so
far
as
i
know,
i
mean
we
do
not
have
any
record
of
any
--
they
do
not
keep
or
they
don't
write
opinions,
the
decisions
are
not
reported
in
any
of
these
reports.
mr.
earl
mcbee
so
it
would
be
difficult
to
find,
i
mean
in
the
actual
cases
on
there.
i
don't
know
how
much
time
i
have
left,
but
i
did
want
to
go
to
a
comment
on
the
point
that
is
raised
in
reference
to
1142.
as
we
understand
it,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
said
that
1142
applies
not
in
freedom
of
the
speech
cases,
but
has
its
application
only
in,
in
the
matter
related
to
the
blocking
of
the
sidewalk
or
traffic
situation
in
relation
to
sidewalks
and
streets.
and
on
page
17
of
our
brief,
we
do
quote
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
reference
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
section
1142
as
amended
that
[inaudible]
city
code
which
states
that
it
is
not
aimed
at
free
speech
and
simply
it
is
a
municipal
regulation,
which
is
confined
to
the
controller
traffic
and
use
of
streets
and
sidewalks.
the
effort
to
bring
into
the
picture
a
contention
that
reverend
shuttlesworth,
because
of
the
fact
that
he
had
some
notoriety
as
a
civil
rights
leader
in
the
city
of
birmingham
is,
we
think
beside
the
point,
because
actually
the
undisputed
testimony
is
that
officer
byars
who
made
the
arrest
and
we're
looking
now
at
page
23
of
the
record
near
the
bottom
of
the
page,
in
which
the
question
was
asked,
you
were
familiar
with
his
face
and
features
were
you
not
of
that
is
of
reverend
shuttlesworth
and
the
answer
was,
i
was
not.
reverend
shuttlesworth
testified
in
the
case
and
he
said
that
he
didn't
recognize
officer
byars,
he
did
not
know
officer
byars.
officer
byars
said
he
did
not
know
shuttlesworth
and
the
testimony
of
shuttlesworth
was
that
at
no
time,
was
he
addressed
that
is,
he
shuttlesworth
addressed
by
his
name.
so
the
clear
import
of
the
evidence
was,
and
so
far
as
i
know
the
uncontradicted
evidence
was
that
mr
byars
who
made
the
arrest
did
not
know
reverend
shuttlesworth.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
he
said
the
entire
group.
there
were
number
in
the
group,
i
mean
of
some
10
or
12
according
his
testimony.
now
he
did
not
say
that
he
didn't
know
that
shuttlesworth
and
phifer
were
colored
people,
but
he
did
not
know.
mr.
earl
mcbee
actually
i
think
that
--
oh
yes,
that's
correct,
yes
that's
true.
mr.
earl
mcbee
that's
what
he
asked
him
and
he
said
he
didn't
know.
he
couldn't
tell
about
that,
but
i
believe
that
another
officer,
officer
holman
i
believe
said
that
they
were
all
colored
as
far
as
he
could
tell.
but
in
reference
to
phifer,
the
same
testimony,
mr
byars
testified
he
did
not
know
reverend
phifer.
reverend
phifer
testified
he
didn't
know
mr.
byars
and
he
did
not
call
mr
byars
by,
i
mean
reverend
phifer
by
his
name.
so
the
evidence
would
clearly
indicate
that
the
fact
that
reverend
shuttlesworth
or
reverend
phifer,
one
of
both
were
well
known
civil
rights
leaders
had
nothing
actually
to
do
with
the
arrest
and
with
the
trial
of
these
defendants.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir,
i
don't
think
it's
presented
in
the
record,
no
sir.
i
agree
on
that.
i
certainly
agree
on
that,
it
doesn't
--
it
is
not
presented
in
the
record
anywhere.
mr.
earl
mcbee
it
does
not
show.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir,
it
was
never
--
as
far
as
i
know
there
were
no
efforts
made
to
bring
up
what
they
were
doing.
mr.
earl
mcbee
but
they
brought
that
up
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
earl
mcbee
that
is
true.
mr.
earl
mcbee
that
is
true,
but
that
was
merely
a
furtherance
of
what
the
court
felt
was
immaterial
inquiry.
the
evidence
had
already
been
in
that
there
was
--
the
rumor
to
be
a
selective
buying
campaign.
i
think
one
of
the
officers
said
that
they
had
heard
about
it,
but
they
were
asked
if
they
had
received
any
instructions
or
official
notice,
they
said
they
had
not.
they
had
been
given
no
instructions
to
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
think
what
they
were
asking
mr.
justice
black,
was
had
there
been
any
of
publication
in
the
radio
or
newspaper
about
the
release
of
these
men
from
jail.
i
believe
that's
what
the
question
involved
was,
there
was
a
trial
pending
in
the
court,
is
that
correct?
that's
right
on
my
release
from
jail.
what
was
the
circumstance
of
you
being
in
there.
in
other
words,
and
mr.
walker
objected
to
going
in
to
a
side
issue
of
what
he
had
been
in
jail
about
and
about
which
they
have
done
a
hearing
over
in
the
federal
court.
that
did
not
relate
at
all
as
i
see
it
to
any
sort
of
civil
rights
movement
or
civil
rights
activity.
mr.
earl
mcbee
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
it
contains
it
all.
mr.
earl
mcbee
no
sir,
the
only
--
there
was
not.
this
is
all
there
is
on
the
subject
of
that
question,
simply
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
hearing
over
in
the
federal
court
had
received
wide
publicity,
that's
all.
and
the
court
felt
that
was
extraneous
and
of
course
the
question
--
the
next
question
was,
why
was
it
necessary
for
you
to
leave
19th
and
go
to
16th
street
and
5th
avenue
to
get
a
cup
of
coffee,
that
was
another
question
which
was
not
relevant
to
anything
that
went
on
there,
why
they
left.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
actually
that
i
think
is
probably
correct.
mr.
earl
mcbee
that
you
cannot
tell
with
definite
certainty.
i
would
say
that
if
there
be
a
choice,
you
would
have
to
say
that
since
the
conviction
was
on
both
counts
and
the
conviction
sustained
on
both
counts
that
it
was
intended
to
be
on
both,
but
that's
another
–-
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
am
not
quite
aware.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
i
guess,
i
would
have
to
put
it
this
way
that
i
do
not
know
that
you
can,
but
i
think
probably
--
you
will
probably
have
to
deal
with
the
cases
though
the
conviction
were
on
both.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well
the
record
is
not
clear
other
than
that
mere
inference,
it
has
to
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
convicted
as
charged,
that
is
the
only
thing
i
know
of,
which
you
would
have
to
go
with.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
it
is
good
yes
sir
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
and
it
is
true
also,
as
we
understand
it
in
the
criminal
cases
as
well,
because
we
have
the
line
of
cases
of
which
we
think
do
sustain
that
classon
versus
united
states
and
also
pierce
versus
united
states
and
of
course
some
court
of
appeals
cases
u.s.
versus
parollo
and
cliff
versus
united
states,
that
i
believe
is
--
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
i'm
not
sure,
but
at
any
rate
those
cases,
we
say
sustain
the
view
point
that
if
the
court
even
should
determine
that
one
of
the
cases
is
not
sufficiently
proven
by
the
evidence
that
the
conviction
should
be
sustained
by
the
good
count
unless
we
do
get
into
a
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
counts
and
the
court
holds
that
the
ordinances
sustained
was
supporting
either
of
the
counts
is
unconstitutional,
then
i
think
you
would
have
to
reverse
it.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
the
only
point
that
i
can
see
is
that
historically
the
holding
has
been
that
either
in
the
federal
and
criminal
cases
or
several
cases
either
one.
if
you
have
a
good
count
to
which
the
conviction
can
be
sustained
and
you
did
not
give
him
more
than
he
was
and
that
he
could
have
received
for
that
one
count,
then
if
you
merely
find
that
the
evidence
isn't
insufficient
to
support,
then
you
rest
your
decision
on
the
good
count
and
sustain
them.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
i
do
think
so.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
do
think
that's
true.
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
earl
mcbee
the
only
thing
is,
he
got
no
more
than
he
could
have
gotten
--
mr.
earl
mcbee
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
of
course
the
--
i
mean
the
record
is
clear.
i
mean,
he
was
convicted
on
as
charged
in
the
complaint,
i
mean
that
is
what
we
have
to
stand
on.
mr.
earl
mcbee
i
think
it
was,
yes
sir,
i
believe
that,
although
i
can't
say
for
positive
certainty,
but
i
surely
believe.
mr.
earl
mcbee
well,
that
maybe
the
case.
yes
sir.
mr.
earl
mcbee
it's
not
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
