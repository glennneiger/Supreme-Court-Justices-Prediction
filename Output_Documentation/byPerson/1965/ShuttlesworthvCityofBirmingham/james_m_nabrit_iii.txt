mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
reverend
fred
l.
shuttlesworth,
a
negro
minister
and
well
known
civil
rights
leader
in
birmingham,
alabama
was
arrested
by
four
or
five
police
officers
at
10:30
in
the
morning
on
wednesday,
april
04,
1962,
for
loitering
and
failing
to
obey
the
orders
of
a
policeman
on
a
corner
in
downtown
birmingham,
alabama.
shuttlesworth
was
convicted
in
the
recorder's
court,
and
again
convicted
after
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
circuit
court
and
was
sentenced
to
180
days
hard
labor,
six
months,
and
an
additional
61
days
hard
labor
in
default
of
a
fine
in
courts.
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
alabama
court
of
appeals,
which
affirmed
the
conviction,
rejecting
petitioner's
federal
constitutional
claims.
now
i
would
state
the
facts
in
some
detail.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
there
were
two
ordinances
mentioned
in
the
complaint.
the
limit
i
think
for
all
misdemeanors
under
the
code
is
six
months
and
a
$100
fine.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
maximum
that
you
could
get
for
one
offense.
now,
i
would
state
the
facts
in
some
detail,
because
they
are
i
think
important
to
an
appreciation
of
petitioner's
arguments
that
the
birmingham's
laws
were
unconstitutionally
vague
as
applied
to
him
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
the
conviction.
now
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
in
sharp
conflict,
but
i
will
relate
the
police
version
referring
only
slightly
at
the
beginning
of
the
certain
uncontradicted
defense
testimony
about
matters
prior
to
the
actual
arrest
incident.
the
defense
version
of
the
facts
was
totally
irreconcilable
with
the
policeman's
case.
the
defense
claim
was
that
the
police
case
was
a
complete
fabrication,
an
attempt
to
--
the
arrest
was
an
harassment.
now
shuttlesworth
and
his
companion,
reverend
james
phifer,
were
arrested
shortly
after
they
left
the
federal
district
court
in
birmingham,
where
they
were
engaged
in
litigating
a
prior
disorderly
conduct
prosecution
after
a
remand
from
this
court.
the
two
ministers
had
been
jailed
for
over
a
month,
this
record
reveals,
early
in
1962
and
on
february
26,
this
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
federal
district
court
with
an
order
which
resulted
in
shuttlesworth's
eventual
release.
now
these
proceedings,
this
record
indicates,
were
a
widely
publicized
headlines
story
in
the
local
papers.
and
there
is
no
dispute
that
shuttlesworth
was
well
known
in
birmingham
for
civil
rights
activities
and
well
known
by
the
police
department,
which
had
arrested
him
on
a
variety
of
occasions
in
connection
with
civil
rights
activities,
some
of
the
arresting
officers
testified,
they
knew
about
this.
now
on
april
04,
1962,
after
leaving
the
federal
court,
which
is
located
at
5th
avenue
in
19th
street
in
birmingham,
shuttlesworth
and
phifer,
followed
by
four
other
negro
men,
walking
down
19th
street
from
5th
avenue
towards
2nd
avenue,
the
heart
of
the
birmingham's
downtown
shopping
center
area,
about
10:30
in
the
morning
into
the
business
district,
and
this
morning
there
were
very
few
negroes
on
the
streets
in
downtown
birmingham,
because
the
negroes
were
boycotting
the
downtown
stores
and
there
is
testimony
that
this
group
was
conspicuous.
now
the
group
attracted
to
the
attention
of
the
police
officer
robert
byars
who
was
the
traffic
officer
assigned
to
3rd
avenue
in
19th,
but
wasn't
at
his
post,
he
was
half
a
block
away,
standing
on
19th
street
by
an
alley.
byars
said
he
saw
this
group
walking
down
the
street,
they
weren't
doing
anything,
weren't
violating
any
laws,
just
walking
south
towards
2nd
avenue.
at
this
point,
byars
entered
a
store,
which
sits
on
the
corner
of
2nd
and
19th
and
runs
--
the
alley
entrance
to
this
store,
newberry's
department
store
and
followed
the
petitioner's
path
by
byars
going
through
to
the
store,
and
he
followed
parallel
to
their
path,
reaching
--
the
petitioners
and
byars
reaching
the
corner
of
2nd
avenue
in
19th
street.
when
officer
byars
got
to
the
corner,
he
says
that
he
stood
inside
looking
out
through
the
glass
door,
and
by
now
the
group
which
he
said
was
5
or
6
people
had
reached
10
or
12.
and
he
saw
10
or
12
persons
all
congregated
on
the
corner,
he
said
standing
and
listening
and
talking,
that
shuttlesworth
was
among
them
and
the
group
was
just
standing
and
talking
mostly
to
shuttlesworth,
it
was
in
byars
words,
doing
quite
a
bit
of
talking
himself.
policeman
byars
says
incidentally
that
he
didn't
know
shuttlesworth,
although
he
acknowledged
he
had
seen
him
on
television,
seen
his
photograph
and
read
about
him
in
the
papers
and
he
also
heard
about
this
boycott.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
he
says
both,
he
said
he
didn't
know
–
said
seen
him
on
television.
byars
also
maintained
that
he
didn't
even
know
the
race
of
this
group
on
the
corner,
he
didn't
notice
it
in
the
trial,
he
didn't
know
what
race
this
group
was,
although,
several
other
officers
testified
they
were
all
negroes.
anyway
byars
states
that
he
stood
inside
the
door
watching
the
group
for
a
minute
to
a
minute-and-a-half,
and
then
stepped
outside
and
told
the
group
to
move
on
and
clear
the
sidewalk
and
not
obstruct
it
for
pedestrians.
he
said
some,
but
not
all
the
group
began
to
move,
so
he
repeated
his
order
and
then
shuttlesworth
asked
him,
“you
mean
to
say,
we
can't
stand
here
on
the
sidewalk?”
at
this
point,
three
more
officers,
two
on
motorcycles,
arrived
on
the
corner
and
a
fourth
was
approaching
on
foot.
officers
homer
and
davis,
who
were
on
another
corner
of
the
intersection
were
beckoned
over
by
byars.
rensheur
came
up
on
his
motorcycle
and
patrolman
allred
who
was
assigned
to
a
corner
about
two
blocks
away
arrived
--
began
to
approach.
after
shuttlesworth
asked
this
question,
byars
says
he
didn't
answer.
he
just
hesitated
for
what
he
called
a
short
time
and
said
that
was
for
the
third
and
last
time
he
was
informing
them
they
would
have
to
move
and
clear
the
sidewalk
or
else
they
would
be
arrested.
by
now,
according
to
the
officers,
byars
included,
everyone
except
shuttlesworth
was
moving
away
and
had
dispersed
and
at
this
point,
shuttlesworth
asked
byars
a
second
question,
which
byars
told
two
versions
of
it.
on
page
18
of
the
record,
byars
says,
shuttlesworth's
second
question
was,
“do
you
mean
to
tell
me,
we
can't
stand
here
in
the
front
of
this
store.”
over
on
page
20,
still
on
direct
examination,
byars
says
that
shuttlesworth's
second
question
was,
“do
you
mean
to
tell
we
can't
go
into
the
store.”
in
any
event,
whatever
happened
at
this
point,
byars
without
answering
told
shuttlesworth
he
was
under
arrest.
byars
says,
shuttlesworth
said,
“well
i
will
go
into
the
store”
and
started
into
newberry's
department
store
where
byars
pursued
him
inside
the
door,
took
him
by
the
arm,
and
told
him
he
was
under
arrest.
now
shuttlesworth
didn't
resist.
he
was
a
docile
prisoner
and
gave
no
trouble.
by
byars
estimate,
the
whole
episode
by
the
time
he
stepped
out
and
first
confronted
the
group
till
he
arrested
shuttlesworth
in
the
store,
consumed
a
minute
and
to
a
minute-and-a-half,
a
minute
to
a
minute-and-a-half.
a
few
minutes
later,
patrolman
byars
was
though,
a
few
minutes
later,
he
arrested
reverend
phifer.
he
arrested
reverend
phifer,
because
phifer
persisted
in
talking
to
shuttlesworth
who
was
under
arrest
waiting
to
be
carried
away
in
a
patrol
car
and
byars
took
it
as
unlawful
for
somebody
to
talk
to
his
prisoner
over
his
objections.
phifer
incidentally
was
tried
and
convicted
on
the
same
record
with
shuttlesworth,
but
his
conviction
was
overturned
on
appeal
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
defense
testimony
of
--
byars
didn't
testify,
but
the
defense
testimony
was
that
shuttlesworth
was
asking
phifer
to
come
over
and
arrange
for
a
bail
bond
to
come
and
get
him
out
of
jail.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
have
been
unable
to
ascertain
that.
this
record
doesn't
indicate
it
and
the
reported
opinion
doesn't
indicate
it,
i
can't
find
it
out.
i'm
sure
your
honor
--
yes
i
would.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
my
co-counselor
tells
me
that
it
was
the
exactly
the
same
charge,
it
was
exactly
the
same
complaint
and
mr.
amaker
tells
me
that
it
was
a
same
sentence
also,
six
months.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
sir.
the
officer's
testimony
about
where
this
group
was
standing
on
the
corner
and
how
much
of
it
all
they
blocked
the
pedestrians,
it
was
confusing
to
say
the
least.
byars
said
this
group
10:30
in
the
morning
was
blocking
half
of
the
sidewalk
causing
the
people
walking
east
and
west
either
have
to
wait
for
--
they
causing
--
the
people
walking
east,
either
have
to
wait
for
people
walking
west
to
get
out
of
their
way
or
step
into
the
side
of
the
street.
however,
on
cross
examination
byars
slightly
contradicted
himself
and
said
that
the
east-west
crosswalk
wasn't
blocked
at
all,
that
they
were
only
occupying
half
of
the
north-south
crosswalk.
in
any
event,
the
very
pertinent
thing
i
think
is
that
the
officer
who
was
in
charge
of
the
traffic
at
this
intersection,
officer
holman,
an
experienced
officer
of
14
years,
i
think
on
the
force,
had
been
standing
on
this
corner
directing
traffic
for
an
hour
before
all
this
started.
and
holman
saw
this
group
before
byars
was
there
and
didn't
pay
any
attention,
listen
to
his
testimony
at
page
62,
at
the
bottom
of
page
62.
question
-
now
you
observe
on
these
corners
from
your
position
here
when
you
tried
to
police
that
corner,
do
you
not?
answer
-
i
tried
to.
and
you
seen
these
people
over
there
blocking
traffic
before
you
saw
officer
byars?
i
saw
him
standing
over
there
talking
to
them.
question
-
did
you
see
them
before
he
was
talking
to
them?
answer
-
i
saw
them
over
there,
i
didn't
pay
any
particular
attention
to
them.
question
-
did
you
get
the
impression
they
were
waiting
for
the
light
to
change?
answer
-
i
couldn't
answer
that,
because
i
don't
know
what
they
had
on
their
mind.
question
-
you
formed
no
impression
when
you
first
saw
them?
answer
-
no.
you
took
no
note
of
them
when
you
first
saw
them,
is
that
right?
answer
-
i
just
saw
them
standing
over
there.
question
-
the
only
time
you
may
note
of
them
standing
over
there,
was
when
you
saw
the
policeman
assisting
you
talking
to
them.
answer
-
when
i
saw
him
over
there
talking
to
them,
he
wasn't
assisting
me.
he
wasn't
assisting
you
with
your
corner?
so,
whatever
obstruction
or
whatever
impairment
to
pedestrian
traffic
had
to
have
been
slight,
the
officer
was
directing
traffic
on
this
corner
didn't
pay
any
attention
to
these
people
certainly.
in
any
event,
byars'
own
version
i
think
demonstrates
that
this
brief
confrontation
--
that
during
this
brief
confrontation
with
shuttlesworth,
a
minute
to
a
minute-and-a
half,
all
shuttlesworth
did
was
ask
byars
questions,
as
the
group
byars
objected
to
dispersed.
now,
about
whether
byars
really
meant
he
couldn't
stand
in
front
of
the
store
or
go
into
the
store,
whichever
version
of
byars
story
you
believe,
and
where
he
could
stand
and
what
he
could
do,
that
would
really
suit
officer
byars.
now
the
state
court
as
i
said,
credited
the
police
--
one
of
the
police
version
of
the
facts
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
defense
testimony
of
byars
--
of
shuttlesworth,
phifer
and
four
other
witnesses,
nothing
in
their
testimony
that
was
it
all
helpful
to
the
states'
case.
their
description
of
the
events,
which
i
will
just
summarize
in
a
sentence
or
two,
was
that
it
can't
possibly
be
reconciled.
they
denied
being
a
part
of
any
group
of
10
or
12,
they
denied
standing
on
a
corner,
they
said
they
merely
slowed,
they
were
waiting
for
the
light,
when
byars
came
out
of
newberry's
and
stood
in
front
of
shuttlesworth
blocking
his
path,
telling
him
to
move
on
and
shuttlesworth
said,
“move
where?”
byars
said,
“move
anywhere”
and
shuttlesworth
said,
“he
was
going
to
the
store”,
byars
immediately
arrested
him.
but
as
i
said,
we
don't
need
to
rely
on
this
--
on
the
defense
version
of
the
evidence.
byars'
own
version
of
the
events,
which
led
to
shuttlesworth's
arrest,
conviction,
and
sentence
to
maximum
of
eight
months
of
hard
labor,
if
you
are
counting
the
time
for
the
fine,
is
i
submit,
incredible
and
outrageous
enough
even
without
reference
to
the
petitioner's
story.
now
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
alabama
courts
your
honor
--
the
alabama
court
of
appeals,
i
assume
you
mean.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
did
not
indicate
what
evidence
it
thought
or
what
charge
it
thought
he
was
convicted
on.
it
summarized
the
evidence,
really
saying
in
a
paragraph
really
at
page
138.
obviously,
i
believe
--
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
obviously
believing
byars'
version
or
repeating
or
accepting
for
purposes
of
the
appeal,
byars'
version.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
your
honor,
i
mentioned
in
my
statement
of
the
facts,
byars'
testimony
to
that
effect.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
so
that's
the
--
yes
your
honor.
there
was
not
explicit
--
there
were
no
explicit
findings
by
the
triers
of
the
fact.
the
trial
judge
rendered
a
general
verdict,
which
didn't
at
all
illuminate
what
he
thought
shuttlesworth
was
guilty
of.
there
were
two
counts
in
the
complaint,
as
i
will
discuss
in
a
moment
alternative
charges
under
the
first
count,
and
the
trial
judge
just
said
guilty
as
charged
without
indicating
whether
he
found
him
guilty
on
both
counts.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no
jury,
the
jury
was
waived
i
believe.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
your
honor
that
the
normal
rule
is,
that
this
court
accepts
the
facts
as
was
found
by
the
state
court
or
whether
no
specific
findings
of
the
facts,
putting
the
states'
case
in
the
best
slide.
but
the
rule
is,
the
court
is
always
recognized
that
if
facts
were
determined
to
have
a
constitutional
right,
it
had
the
power
to
scrutinize
the
record
itself,
it
didn't
have
to
accept
the
appellate
court's
characterization
of
the
facts.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
was
asking
the
court
to
give
the
record
its
normal
close
scrutiny,
the
normal
review
that
it
does
in
a
case
involving
constitutional
rights.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
certainly
in
that
connection.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
thompson
and
louisville
argument
is
directed
to
the
accusation
under
section
1231,
just
look
at
the
statute
now.
this
statute
is
a
single
sentence
of
the
ordinance.
it
makes
it
unlawful
to
refuse,
or
fail
to
comply
with
any
lawful
order,
signal
or
direction
of
a
police
officer
and
the
second
count
charged
him
in
the
language
of
the
statute
without
any
further
detail.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well
there
was
one
complaint
in
two
counts,
and
the
trial
court
found
guilty
as
charged.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
1231.
now
that
thompson
and
louisville
argument
you
asked
me
about.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
is
directed
to
1231.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
now
1231
on
its
face
is
just
--
a
most
general
law.
it
says
that
anybody
who
doesn't
obey
a
policeman
is
guilty
of
a
crime,
but
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
yes
a
lawful
order,
signal,
or
direction.
the
alabama
court
of
appeals,
i
they
think
obviously
cognizant
of
the
vagueness
problem
here,
gave
the
statute
a
very
specific
construction
in
phifer's
case.
it
said
that
1231
is
limited
to
orders
of
policemen
directing
vehicular
traffic.
the
pertinent
quote
of
the
opinion
i
quote
is
on
the
last
page
of
our
brief
on
page
30.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
phifer's.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
only
phifer's.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
your
honor
exactly
and
in
addition,
i
claim
that
the
conviction
under
1142
was
also
there.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
both
were
there.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
nowhere
in
its
statement
of
facts
says
anything
about
vehicular
traffic.
and
1231
and
the
case
decided
--
phifer's
case
decided
with
this
says
that,
you
can't
convict
under
1231
except
for
violation
of
an
order
of
a
policemen
directing
vehicles.
now
the
sentence,
right
on
the
last
page
of
our
brief,
page
30,
here's
what
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
says
though,
only
up
to
this
point
though,
only
interpretation
of
1231,
this
section
appears
in
the
chapter
regulating
vehicular
traffic
and
provides
for
the
enforcement
of
the
orders
of
the
officers
of
the
police
department
in
directing
such
traffic.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
decision
was
phifer.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it
was
two
weeks
before
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
november
19,
november
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
by
about
two
weeks,
i
think
it's
november
05,
1963,
and
shuttlesworth's
was
november
19.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
but
byars
was
a
traffic
officer
assigned
to
the
next
corner,
a
block
away
from
where
he
arrested
shuttlesworth.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it
held
that
in
phifer's
case.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
don't
know.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i'm
assuming
that's
correct,
but
the
opinion
doesn't
indicate
who
the
judges
were,
it
was
per
curiam
and
it
doesn't
say,
i
assume
that
the
sixth
division
of
the
same
judge.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
they
didn't,
they
could
have
relied
on
it,
cited
a
reliance
on
it.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
they
tried
them
together
with
a
single
record.
now
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
that
is
the
argument
that
is
the
argument.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
your
honor,
i
submit
that
no
one
in
the
trial
court
had
the
faintest
notion
that
they
were
litigating
any
issue
about
vehicular
traffic.
byars
kept
telling
shuttlesworth
on
the
street
corner,
you
are
interfering
with
pedestrian
traffic,
he
kept
using
those
words
and
the
prosecutor
in
the
trial
kept
talking
about
pedestrian
traffic.
the
city's
brief
cites
four
pages
in
the
record
for
the
preposition
that
--
and
a
factual
assertion
that
these
pedestrians
who
stepped
into
the
street
interfered
with
vehicles.
as
they
cite
pages
17,
20,
28
and
39.
gentlemen,
there
is
no
evidence
on
those
four
pages
or
anywhere
else
in
the
record
that
anybody,
any
pedestrians
or
anyone
else
interfered
with
vehicular
traffic.
it
was
there
that
people
stepped
into
the
street,
but
no
evidence
that
they
interfered
with
the
vehicles.
there
is
no
evidence
that
byars
was
giving
a
order
relating
to
vehicles.
he
kept
talking
about
pedestrians.
so,
if
not
a
thompson
versus
louisville
problem,
that
at
the
very
least,
petitioner
shuttlesworth
finds
himself
in
this
court
for
the
first
time
faced
with
the
factual
contention
that
he
interfered
with
vehicles.
it's
like
cole
versus
arkansas,
if
not
like
thompson
versus
louisville.
i
submit
that
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
my
argument
goes
on
the
premise
that
i
cannot
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
and
that
there
is
no
way
to
know.
that
the
trial
judge's
general
verdict,
not
even
indicating
which
count
he
was
relying
on,
precludes
us
from
knowing.
that
if
there
is
--
and
as
court
is
held
in
cases
like
stromberg
against
california
and
thomas
versus
collins,
which
is
very
much
in
point,
because
that's
a
non-jury
case
of
contempt,
unlimited
penalty,
that
the
burden
is
not
to
be
placed
on
a
petitioner
to
satisfy
the
court
that
he
wasn't
convicted
on
a
valid
charge,
when
he
may
have
been
convicted
as
far
as
the
record
reveals
on
an
invalid
charge.
so
that
if
either
charge
is
bad,
the
whole
conviction
must
fall,
particularly
where
it
is
within
the
power
of
the
trial
judge
to
avoid
this
ambiguity
that's
such
a
doubt
of
the
constitutional
dimensions
not
to
be
resolved
against
the
defendant.
now
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
identical.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
clark
as
our
brief
suggests,
it's
“alice
in
wonderland”
one
day
they
say
that
the
statute
covers
only
vehicles.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
so,
the
one
clue
perhaps
is
that
in
sustaining
these
two,
the
shuttlesworth
conviction,
the
court
doesn't,
the
appellate
court
like
the
trial
court
doesn't
distinguish
between
1231
and
1142.
all
it
says
is
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
--
was
introduced
for
the
court
to
find
the
defendant
guilty
under
the
complaint,
without
any
analysis
or
discussion
of
the
elements
of
1231
or
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
perhaps.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
they
discussed
the
1142
charge
against
phifer
too.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
they
said
that
even
officer
byars
didn't
believe
phifer
was
guilty
of
that
and
then
on
byars'
own
story
when
phifer
left
and
when
--
although
byars
at
one
point
said
he
was
trying
to
get
phifer
--
trying
to
catch
phifer
and
when
phifer
came
back,
byars
didn't
arrest
him
when
he
saw
him
again,
he
just
kept
telling
him
to
move
on
and
only
really
arrested
him
when
he
persisted
in
talking
to
shuttlesworth.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
everyone
left
except
the
affirmative
was,
everyone
moved
back
at
least
and
there
was
nobody
there,
but
shuttlesworth
for
a
moment
and
shuttlesworth
and
the
four
or
five
police
officers
according
to
byars
story.
and
then
when
after
--
again
according
to
byars,
after
phifer
went
into
the
--
after
shuttlesworth
went
into
the
store,
and
was
arrested
and
taken
back
out
and
stood
on
the
corner
waiting
for
the
police
wagon
where
he
waited
for
some
minutes,
phifer
then
came
over
and
tried
to
talk
to
him,
and
it
was
while
he
was
waiting
at
this
point
that
phifer
was
arrested.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
he
was
charged
exactly
the
same
and
although
byars
contended
that
he
was
in
the
same
group
on
the
corner
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
right.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
before
shuttlesworth's
arrest,
at
the
time
of
phifer's
arrest?
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
oh
yes
sir.
well
the
testimony
--
they
only
--
the
real
testimony
about
that
is
that
the
people
were
standing
along
the
side
of
the
newberry
store
there.
there
is
a
wide
sidewalk.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it
is
not
in
this
record.
i
think
that
the
view
of
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
took
of
shuttlesworth
and
the
view
it
took
for
phifer,
is
that
the
court
thought
that
phifer
moved
when
byars
first
told
him
to
move
on.
and
then
phifer
was
arrested
for
talking
to
shuttlesworth
later,
whereas
shuttlesworth
was
arrested
for
his
failing
to
obey
the
earlier
command,
but
this
doesn't
at
all
explain
the
fact
that
it
all
changed
the
fact,
there
was
no
evidence
that
shuttlesworth
was
interfering
with
vehicular
traffic
or
that
the
officers
orders
were
directed
to
vehicular
traffic.
now
before
discussing
section
1142,
and
the
first
count
of
the
complaint,
i
would
like
to
point
out
from
the
very
beginning.
at
the
pre-trial,
petitioner
relied
on
both
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
claimed
that
the
arrest
was
a
part
of
a
campaign
of
harassment
against
him
during
the
trial.
in
1962,
in
birmingham,
fred
shuttlesworth
was
himself
a
symbol
of
the
civil
rights
movement,
just
as
much
as
police
commissioner
eugene
bull
connor
was
a
symbol
of
unyielding
segregationist
resistance.
mr.
shuttlesworth
was
just
walking
down
the
street
in
the
face
of
the
continued
police
efforts
to
keep
him
in
jail
was
a
symbol
of
the
movement.
and
his
freedom
to
walk
on
the
streets
and
move
about
was
indispensable
to
shuttlesworth's
freedom
to
associate
with
others
and
the
freedom
to
be
a
civil
rights
leader
in
birmingham.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
take
it
only
after
being
confronted
with
byars
command.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
he
was
trying
to
–
but
by
his
version,
he
was
going
into
the
store
to
get
away
from
byars,
by
shuttlesworth
account.
so,
i
think
there
is
definitely
a
first
amendment
aspect
to
the
matter,
that
just
standing
on
the
street
shuttlesworth
did
embody
the
civil
rights
movement
in
birmingham,
but
there
was
a
first
amendment
situation
even
on
the
states'
version
of
the
facts,
because
the
police
version
was
shuttlesworth
standing
in
amidst
of
a
group
of
12
people,
the
center
of
the
conversation
talking
to
them
and
talking
to
him
and
shuttlesworth
denied
this,
but
accepting
the
states'
version
that
shuttlesworth
was
standing
amidst
--
gathered
this
crowd
and
he
was
talking
to
them,
we
have
a
person
exercising
first
amendment
rights
in
a
simple
form,
but
nevertheless
in
an
important
and
constitutionally
protected
manner,
because
to
communicate
with
a
small
group
of
people
is
just
as
much
first
amendment
activity
as
to
make
the
speech
or
distribute
hand
bill.
now,
referring
the
court
to
section
1142
set
out
on
page
two
and
three
of
our
brief,
one
of
the
complaint
was
framed
on
the
second
paragraph
of
1142,
so
if
we
could
turn
directly
to
that,
its
in
two
sentences.
the
first
one
makes
it
unlawful,
for
any
person
or
any
number
of
persons
to
so
stand
or
loiter
or
walk
upon
any
street
or
sidewalk
in
the
city,
as
to
obstruct
free
passage
over
on
the
longer
sidewalk.
and
then
the
second
sentence
says,
it
shall
also
be
an
unlawful
and
note
the
word
also,
to
be
also
unlawful
for
any
person
to
stand
or
loiter
upon
any
street
or
sidewalk
of
the
city
after
having
been
requested
by
any
police
officer
to
move
on.
we
have
two
alternative
ways,
on
the
face
of
it
at
least,
two
alternative
ways
of
committing
the
offense.
the
first
being
to
stand
or
loiter
so
as
to
obstruct
free
passage
and
the
second
alternative
being,
to
stand
or
loiter
after
having
been
requested
to
move
on.
the
complaint
against
shuttlesworth
was
disjunctive
just
like
the
statute.
the
complaint,
page
two
and
three
of
the
record,
the
charge
is
exactly
in
the
words
of
the
statute,
that
shuttlesworth
did
stand
or
loiter
or
walk
upon
a
street
or
sidewalk
within
and
among
of
group
of
other
persons,
so
as
to
obstruct
free
passage,
and
then
naming
the
intersection
or
did,
or
did
while
the
said
groups
stand
or
loiter
upon
say
a
street
or
sidewalk
after
having
been
requested
by
a
police
officer
to
move
on,
they
are
both
contrary
to
section
1142.
the
time
of
shuttlesworth's
arrest,
there
had
been
no
construction
or
interpretation
of
this
law,
no
judicial
gloss
put
on
it
whatsoever.
shuttlesworth
took
the
law
as
it
was
written.
and
as
it
was
written,
certainly
the
second
sentence,
the
second
alternative,
the
part
dealing
with
standing
or
loitering
after
police
officer
has
requested
you
to
move
on
is
unconstitutionally
vague,
because
it
puts
the
citizens
right
to
be
on
the
street,
no
matter
what
he
is
doing
in
the
complete
control
of
the
policemen.
it
contains
no
guidance
for
the
citizen,
the
policemen,
the
trier
of
the
fact,
anyone
and
even
more
invidiously
perhaps
the
law
by
precluding
the
citizen
from
standing
long
enough
to
question
the
policemen
about
what
his
order
means
or
ask
him
about
it,
makes
it
impossible
for
the
citizen
to
stand
there
even
long
enough
to
judge,
whether
the
officer
is
justified
in
giving
the
order
lest
he
be
found
guilty
of
loitering
after
the
request
to
move.
we
submit
that
after
this
last
aspect,
this
law
really
failed
to
warn
shuttlesworth,
and
really
standing
for
a
moment
and
asking
an
officer
whether
he
really
meant
that
he
couldn't
stand
in
front
of
the
store
would
constitute
punishable
loitering,
after
an
order
to
move
on.
i
submit
that
1142
is
unconstitutionally
vague
for
all
of
the
reasons
this
court
is
ever
given
in
vagueness
cases
for
invalidating
laws.
there
is
the
lack
of
fair
warning,
there
is
the
lack
of
guidance
to
the
administrator,
the
executive
officer,
the
policemen
and
the
trier
of
the
fact
and
in
addition
to
that,
this
law
if
any
law
does,
is
completely
susceptible
of
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
applications.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
but
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
law
as
shuttlesworth
took
it
when
he
was
arrested.
the
state's
argument
now
is,
that
the
prosecution
is
somehow
saved
by
a
construction
of
the
law,
which
they
contend
narrows
it,
i
submit
the
narrowing
itself
illusory,
but
they
contend
narrows
it,
which
took
place
two
years
later,
two
years
after
shuttlesworth
or
two-and-a-half
years
after
shuttlesworth's
arrest.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
there
are
two
things
to
that.
if
that
is
correct,
it
was
certainly
not
explicit
in
either
phifer
or
shuttlesworth,
certainly
not
explicit.
what
they
said
in
the
middlebrooks
was
that,
this
was
the
racial
disadvantage
of
those
earlier
cases,
but
even
if
that
be
so,
even
if
the
narrowing
construction
came
in
shuttlesworth's
own
case,
even
if
we
concede
that,
then
that
still
does
not
cure
the
lack
where
this
tortured
interpretation
of
the
statute,
torturing
of
the
words
to
make
it
one
offense
rather
than
two,
doesn't,
in
shuttlesworth
own
case
even
doesn't
give
him
fair
warning
when
he
was
--
as
on
the
time
he
was
arrested,
mr.
justice
brennan
wrote
an
opinion
in
bouie
against
city
of
colombia
in
which
he
stated
what
i
think
is
the
principle
that
applies
to
this
subs

post
facto,
if
you
will
construction
of
what
the
law
meant.
the
court
--
the
majority
opinion
stated,
that
even
where
vague
statutes
are
concerned,
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
vice
in
such
on
any
enactment
cannot
be
cured
in
a
given
case
by
a
construction
in
that
very
case,
placing
valid
limits
on
the
statute,
for
the
objection
of
vagueness
is
two-fold;
inadequate
guidance
to
the
individual
whose
conduct
is
regulated
and
adequate
guidance
to
the
triers
of
fact.
the
former
objection
could
not
be
cured
retrospectively
by
a
ruling
either
of
the
trial
court
or
the
appellate
court,
though
it
might
be
cured
for
the
future
by
an
authoritarian
judicial
class.
but
beyond
even
this,
really
the
--
this
middlebrooks
doctrine
that
--
that
twists
the
words
of
the
statute
to
make
it
--
to
make
it
now
mean
something
different,
to
make
it
now
meaning
that
the
policeman
can't
just
order
any
citizen
off,
the
policeman
can
only
give
the
order
if
there
is
a
prior
obstruction,
is
it
really
what
it
says,
because

the
alabama
court
has
construed
this
law.
it
says
that
the
police
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
that
there
was
an
obstruction
by
merely
proving
that
the
policeman
gave
the
order
and
that
the
burden

of

of

to

they
certainly
never
articulated
it
in
shuttlesworth
or
in

this
notion
that
the
statute
really
was
one

rather
than
the

spelled
out
in

mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
sir,
i
understand
that
it
is
the
downtown
shopping
area,
there
is
another
department
store
that
exists
across
the

this
is
an
area
with

in

on

morning.
mr.

they
were
coming
from
federal
court
and
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
from
federal
court,
they
have
been
there
in
federal
court,
for
the
hearing
on
the
disorderly
conduct
charge,
it
was
an
habeas
corpus
and
that
trial
didn't
last
very
long,
it
must
be
continued
or
something,
they
stayed
there
a
few
moments
and
they
left,
they
were
walking
down
the
19th
street,
three
blocks
from
the
courthouse,
when
they
encountered
officer
byars
on
this
corner.
mr.
james
m.

when
they
encountered
the
patrolman
byars
at

they
were
coming
from
fifth
and

where
he
caught
them.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
officers
--
here
we
have
two
completely
contradictory
versions.
the
officer's
version
is
they
saw
them
walking
down
the
street,
standing
on
the
corner;
a
group
of
people
gathered
around
and
shuttlesworth
was
talking
to
all
of
them.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no
sir,
no
sir,
no
sir,
just
in
that
there
was
not
any
demonstration,
picketing
or
anything
like
that.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
--
anything
going
on,
they
were
kind
of
in
area
not
that
doing
anything
in
this
store,
no
sitting
and
no
hit
off,
no
hit
off
anything.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
is
a
possible
inference
that
they
might
have
been
talking
about.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
is
a
possible
inference
that
they
might
have
been
looking
around
to
see
what's
with
the
boycott,
there
is
no
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
negroes
in
the
town
were
--
were
boycotting
the
downtown
store
--
they
were
--
what
they
called
as
in
the
record
a
selective
buying
campaign,
so
there
weren't
many
negroes
on
the
streets
at
downtown
this
day
and
this
group
was
--
shuttlesworth's
group
was
very
conspicuous,
there
were
the
only
negroes
around
town.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
something
--
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think,
i
do,
i
used
to
live
there.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
you
could
draw
a
lot
to
cover
that
conduct
certainly.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
fact
you
are
giving
me
were
[inaudible]
let
me
say
that,
and
the
police
never
claimed
these
people
completely
blocked
the
sidewalk,
it
is
half
the
sidewalk
they
were
occupying.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
your
honor
i
would
suggest
that
--
that
by
reading
byars'
testimony
carefully,
he
really
never
claimed
that
much.
i
do
not
think
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
byars
said
that
they
were
blocking
half
the
sidewalk,
the
people
coming
west
could
go
by
--
the
people
coming
east
would
have
to
either
wait
for
those
pedestrians
going
west
or
step
into
the
sidewalk
and
as
some
did
and
were
there
for
a
minute
and
a
half
before
--
a
minute,
two
a
minute
and
a
half.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
by
a
narrowly
drawn
law,
there
is
an
actual
obstruction
and
there
is
–
and
the
person
is
notched
at.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
the
contrary.
i
was
just
indicating,
that
in
every
claim
they
blocked
the
whole
sidewalk,
there
was
never
any
indication
that
they
were
intentionally
there,
they
were
there
for
purpose
of
blocking
the
sidewalk,
they
were
there
for
a
minute
and
half
and
that
byars
also
justified
that
completely
the
opposite,
that
they
weren't
[inaudible]
they
were
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no
sir,
actually
no
sir.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
say
at
the
outset,
the
petitioner
objected
pretrial
to
the
constitutionality
of
section
1231
in
the
very
same
terms,
he
objected
to
the
constitutionality
of
section
1142
and
it's
all
on
page
six
of
the
demurrer
and
also
exactly
the
same
way
page
four
and
the
motion
to
quash.
this
last
case
of
shuttlesworth
in
this
court
involved
a
similar
sort
of
an
attempt
to
prevent
this
court
from
reaching
the
federal
issue
that
would
involved
the
wrong
side
of
the
paper.
well,
this
esoteric
procedural
rule,
that
a
pleading
that
is
labeled
separate
even
though,
it
is
nevertheless
called
joined
and
therefore
improper
is
i
submit,
requires
a
meaningless
ritual
like
this
court
talked
about
in
staub
against
baxley
where
the
man
had
to
write
in
separate
sentences,
i
object
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
law
and
that
law.
under
--
but
it
is
plain
that
the
petitioner
presented
his
constitutional
objection
to
both
statues
and
ample
time
for
the
court
to
rule
on
them,
to
understand
his
objection
very
plainly.
now,
i
don't
propose
to
devote
much
more
time
to
a
mystery
of
what
he
was
convicted
about.
it
seemed
to
me
clear
that
the
court
can't
note
that
the
prosecutor
convicted
him
doesn't
seem
to
know
at
this
point,
but
i
think
both
charges
were
constitutionally
vulnerable.
section
1142,
it
is
so
obviously
capable
of
sweeping
and
discriminatory
application
that
if
such
a
law
as
this
were
upheld,
no
civil
rights
worker
could
ever
safely
venture
on
the
streets
in
a
community
where
the
police
were
disposed
to
suppress
civil
rights
activity.
the
threat
of
serious
penalties,
here
eight
months
in
jail
serves
as
deterrent
to
coerce
to
obey
lawless
police
orders.
as
for
example,
police
orders
of
a
type
in
right
against
georgia
that
is
specifically
designed
to
enforce
segregation.
and
this
one
is
obviously
capable
of
application
to
first
amendment
situation,
to
every
kind
of
first
amendment
situation
on
the
streets.
it
makes
the
policemen
the
dictator
of
the
streets
without
any
possibility
of
a
effective
review
by
the
courts.
the
very
fact
that
under
this
court's
usual
practice,
the
facts
escapes
strict
review,
demonstrates
the
necessity
for
a
really
strict
standard
of
the
statutory
specificity
with
a
law
so
easily
susceptible
of
abuse
and
use
to
suppress
free
speech.
i
would
point
out
however,
that
this
court's
decisions
in
edwards
against
south
carolina
and
cox
against
louisiana
last
term
make
a
claim
that
the
court
has
the
power
and
duty
to
scrutinize
the
record,
that
the
fact
should
be
taken
as
they
appear
in
the
record
consistent
with
the
findings
by
the
alabama
court
of
appeals,
but
not
limited
to
that
court's
characterizations
of
that
fact.
now,
i
believe
that
the
chief
justice
asked
mr.
mcbee
how
wide
the
sidewalks
are
and
he
correctly
responded
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
width
of
the
sidewalks
in
the
record
and
i
understand
he
gave
his
own
estimate.
it
is
my
understanding
that
his
estimate
is
right,
about
12
feet
as
to
the
second
avenue
side,
by
the
19th
street
sidewalk
is
very
wide
about,
20
feet
wide.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
it's
around
20
feet
wide,
the
length
of
that
block.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that's
the
--
the
19
street
side,
the
street
they
had
been
walking
down
and
the
--
it
was
second
street
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
they
were
at
the
intersection
of
these
two,
of
these
two
street
sidewalks.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
somewhere
on
that
intersection,
i
do
not
know
very
clear.
the
--
i
would
conclude
by
suggesting
that
this
prosecution
of
fred
shuttlesworth
and
sentenced
to
eight
months
in
jail
and
hard
labor.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
believe
your
honor,
that
the
sentence
in
the
recorder's
court
was
also
180
days
and
a
$100
fine,
and
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
as
a
matter
of
both
counts.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
justice
clark,
the
final,
the
sense
in
the
recorded
score
as
indicated
on
page
2,
the,
this
is
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
second
one,
the
one
you
were
looking
at.
i
thought
the
question
was
did
he
get
a
jail
term
in
both
courts,
and
the
answer
is
yes,
he
got
a
180
days
in
both
courts,
and
the
$100
fine
in
both
courts.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
am
unable
to
ascertain
whether
--
whether
there
are
two
$100
fines,
i
do
not
think
so,
i
hope
say.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
if
you
do
not
pay
the
fine,
you
get
the
2
months
more.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
confess
by
the
inaccuracy
in
understanding
the
alabama
judgment,
it
says
that
and
then
it
says
all
confessed
judgment
with
good
sufficient
cause,
i
just
do
not
know
what
that
mean.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
he
could
pay.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
he
still
has
to
serve
6
months.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
we
would
in
conclusion
respectfully
submit
that
this
harsh
stature
is
unconstitutionally
vague.
the
statute
that
allows
a
policeman
so
much
scope
and
authority,
i
could
paraphrase
the
words
that
mr.
justice
jackson
in
another
context,
the
issue
is
well,
the
policeman
is
the
law
or
whether
he
is
under
the
law.
this
statute
has
no
limitation
to
place
the
policeman
under
the
law.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
not
to
my
knowledge.
