justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mcbee?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
defendant
convicted
of
obstructing
the
sidewalk
or
of
refusing
to
obey
the
command
of
the
officer
--
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
same
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
would
you
say
to
sustain
this
conviction
you
would
have
to
have
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record,
if
they
were
both
blocking
at
the
sidewalk
and
the
refusal
to
obey
at
the
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
evidence
in
the
record
is
there
that
when
shuttlesworth
refused
to
move
at
the
officer's
request
that
at
that
time,
as
well
as,
before
when
he
was
a
member
of
the
group,
that
there
was
any
blocking
of
the
sidewalk?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
he
was
first
requested
to
move,
not
when
he
was
last
requested,
when
he
was
first
requested
to
move,
there
was
a
group
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
did
not
move
with
the
rest
of
them,
not
–
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
when
you
said
there
was
a
coincidence
of
the
evidence
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mcbee
it
maybe
that
not
everybody
moved
when
the
officer
first
requested
to
do
so
but
where
is
the
evidence
in
that
the
obstruction
which
may
have
existed
there
was
found
to
exist
prior
to
the
request
to
move.
where
is
the
evidence,
they
remained
after
the
request?
it's
only
that
some
of
them
moved
away
and
some
of
them
didn't.
now
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
everybody
moved,
except
shuttlesworth
immediately
upon
the
first
request,
let's
just
assume
that
and
shuttlesworth
stayed
all
alone
stayed
there
and
said,
do
i
really
have
to
move
or
we're
not
obstructing
anymore,
here
i
am,
i
am
standing
here
all
alone,
and
then
the
policemen
arrests
him
what
he
was
arrested
for.
under
the
construction
of
the
statute
that
wouldn't
be
good,
some
instruction
and
a
request
of
full
information.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
refusal
to
move
as
they
instruct
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
apart
from
the
fact
that
everybody
didn't
move?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
1231
charged
[inaudible]
in
shuttlesworth
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
here
is
what
in
the
phifer
case
the
court
said
in
dismissing
the
1231
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
evidence
that
the
defendant
violated
any
traffic
regulation
in
the
city
by
his
refusal
to
move
shuttlesworth
when
order
to
do
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
in
shuttlesworth
case,
what
was
his
trial,
what
traffic
ordinance
did
he
violate?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
previous
sentence
--
the
obstruction
statute
is
that
a
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
was
1142
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
1142
for
vehicular
traffic
–-
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
1231
is
charged
against
shuttlesworth
doesn't
stand,
let's
just
assume
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
this
conviction
have
to
be
reversed?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
was
convicted
of
both
accounts.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
only
one
sentence.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
clear
he
was
convicted
on
both
counts.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
you
find
that
whether
he
was
convicted
on
both
counts?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
with
both
counts.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
will?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said,
i
just
thought
you
said
it
was
clearly
convicted
to
both.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
mean
that
you
can
tell
--
which
he
was
convicted
of
namely
both.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
either
you
can
tell
me
he
is
convicted
of
both
or
you
can't.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
can,
that's
maybe
one
problem
whether
you
can't
tell
which
one
he
was
convicted
of,
it
is
possible
that
he
was
only
convicted
of
one
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
trial
court
if
the
defendant
is
guilty
as
the
charged
in
the
complaint.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you
can't
tell
in
your
opinion
of
what
he
was
convicted
of,
namely
both
counts.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
concede
now
that
you
can't
tell
which
--
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
whole
transcript
or
was
this
testimony
that
was
given
that
doesn't
included
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
was
no
offer
of
proof
available
as
to
on
this
exclusion
of
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
nabrit
did
you
ever
press
you
objections,
or
press
your
point
of
the
evidence
that
you
offered
was
exclusion
[inaudible]
constitutional
term
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
did
not
bring
that
point
here
again.
