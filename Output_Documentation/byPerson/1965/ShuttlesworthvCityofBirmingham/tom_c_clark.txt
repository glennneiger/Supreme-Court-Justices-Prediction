justice
tom
c.
clark
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes,
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
suppose
that
it
says
that
this
crowd
was
blocking
the
sidewalk
[inaudible]
some
of
the
other
pedestrians
were
forced
to
walk
into
the
street.
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
the
finding
of
the
court,
didn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
no
jury?
justice
tom
c.
clark
byars
was
of
course
not
a
traffic
officer
and
therefore
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
the
order,
the
court
held
that
the
order
and
that
he
gave
to
move
on
did
not
have
reference
to
or
based
upon
vehicular
traffic.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
that
sentence
1231,
had
to
do
with
vehicular
traffic,
but
the
conviction
was
set
aside.
justice
tom
c.
clark
now
why
didn't
they
do
that
with
shuttlesworth?
justice
tom
c.
clark
did
they
distinguish
phifer?
i
haven't
read
the
opinion
but
did
they
distinguish
the
phifer's
case?
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
were
companion
cases?
justice
tom
c.
clark
was
phifer
and
shuttlesworth
complained
the
same
information
of
where
it
was.
justice
tom
c.
clark
identical
and
the
phifer
case
which
was
reversed
on
1231,
that's
the
second
count.
i
just
don't
understand,
they
were
all
standing
here
on
the
corner,
we'll
assume
from
the
finding.
phifer
was
in
the
group,
was
he
not,
and
shuttlesworth
was
in
the
group.
they
were
both
charged
with
the
same
offense,
they
were
both
convicted
in
the
same
judgment.
and
then
court
of
appeals
they
reversed
phifer,
because
the
act
referred
to
vehicular
while
it
affirmed
the
other
one,
i
don't
understand
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
then
the
only
thing
that
directed
the
attention
to
in
phifer
was
the
vehicular
traffic
problem
under
1231,
is
that
right?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
what
did
they
say
about
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well
after
that
he
moved
and
then
he
came
back,
is
that
right?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
he
was
arrested
for
a
different
offense,
then
wasn't
he?
justice
tom
c.
clark
shuttlesworth
was
already
under
arrest
when,
whatever
phifer
was
doing
occasioned
his
arrest.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
the
crowd
then
dispersed?
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes.
justice
tom
c.
clark
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
you
would
retry
him,
is
that
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
under
that
theory
you
would
try
him
again,
and
what
would
happen
to
the
case?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
mean
–-
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes,
this
court
concluded
that
they
couldn't
tell
from
the
record,
well
just
what
he
convicted
him
on,
whether
it
was
both
counts
or
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
both
counts.
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
wouldn't
involve
any
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance
is
it
all,
that's
just
a
question
that
makes
sense.
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
never
did
say
that
he
was
convicted
of
both
counts,
did
they?
justice
tom
c.
clark
my
question
is
assuming
that
this
court
--
for
us
to
decide
that
we
couldn't
tell,
then
you
would
retry
the
defendant
or
what
would
you
do
then?
justice
tom
c.
clark
mr.
mcbee
your
position
is
that
the
conviction
was
on
both
counts.
this
is
proven
by
the
fact
that
your
highest
court
discussed
both
counts.
they
would
not
necessarily
had
to
discuss
both
counts
unless
they
thought
there
was
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
this
is
your
position,
is
that
right?
justice
tom
c.
clark
let
me
see
if
i
understand
those
facts.
shuttlesworth
was
arrested
and
they
called
the
police.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
the
officer
took
him
to
curb.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
then
while
he
and
the
officer
were
standing
there
waiting
for
patrol.
justice
tom
c.
clark
mr.
phifer
who
had
left
the
place
where
the
obstruction
was,
he
had
gone
somewhere
else.
justice
tom
c.
clark
he
came
back.
justice
tom
c.
clark
he
came
up
and
commenced
the
talking
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
-–
with
mr.
shuttlesworth
and
the
officer
said
that
you
can't
talk
with
mr.
shuttlesworth,
mr.
shuttlesworth
is
under
arrest.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
he
continued
to
talk
when
the
officer
warned
him
again
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
-–
to
move
on
and
quit
talking
to
him,
and
when
he
warned
him
three
times.
it
was
only
then,
that
he
arrested
phifer.
justice
tom
c.
clark
then
he
had
been
arrested
for
the
blocking;
he
arrested
him
when
he
arrested
shuttlesworth.
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
it
like
thompson
was
convicted?
justice
tom
c.
clark
on
page
11,
they
said,
you
hereby
fined
a
sum
of
$100
and
plus
and
a
new
paragraph
that
said
[inaudible]
fail
to
pay
this
fine
of
$100
and
it
costs
$5
or
confess
judgment
for
goodness
based
on
security
is
therefore
considered
by
the
court
[inaudible]
law
and
then
the
defendant
shuttlesworth
perform
hard
labor.
justice
tom
c.
clark
this
is
the
trial
de
novo
here
which
sentence
is
in
effect.
justice
tom
c.
clark
my
question
is
when
he
--
if
we
were
to
affirm
the
case,
if
he
paid
a
$100
would
it
be
ending
or
would
he
have
pay
to
serve
the
52
days?
justice
tom
c.
clark
all
it
had
to
do
was
just
pay
$100
and
the
case
would
be,
trial
would
be
--?
justice
tom
c.
clark
52
days
for
fine
if
he
could
pay
that.
