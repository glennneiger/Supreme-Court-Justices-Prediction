justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
put
on
the
offense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we
got
--
this
sentence
is
the
maximum
then,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
nabrit,
how
are
we
to
take
this,
version
that
at
138
the
court
of
appeals
gives
us?
is
that
the
set
of
facts
from
which
we
should
decide
those
constitutional
issues.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
asking
us
to
reexamine
them,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
this
in
connection
with
your
thompson
and
louisville
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
you
this,
if
i
may,
before
you
go
on.
if
we
were
to
accept
a
version
of
138
of
the
court
of
appeals,
if
that
were
to
be
the
version
of
the
facts
which
would
tell
--
conclude
this,
what
would
be
left
of
your
thompson
and
louisville
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
which
is
the
convection
that
--
is
before
us,
is
it
under
that
section?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
was
1142
and
other
is
1231.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
a
little
confused
mr.
nabrit,
one
of
these
convictions,
was
it
phifer's
or
was
it
this
one
that
was
set
aside
under
1231,
which
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
phifer's?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
we
have
before
us
are
a
conviction,
which
may
or
may
not
rest
on
both,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
argument
is
that
if
you're
right
about
1231
on
thompson,
louisville
or
other
grounds,
then
the
conviction
has
to
be
set
aside,
because
you
can't
tell
that
it
wasn't
done
to
that
rather
than
under
1142,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
i
wish
to
get
back
to
me,
if
you
will,
to
what
we
do
about
this
set
of
facts
as
the
court
of
appeals
has
set
them
out
immediately
under
its
quotation
of
1231
at
138
of
the
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
was
that
decision
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
when?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
did
precede
the
decision
in
the
shuttlesworth's
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
the
same
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
same
judges?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
everything
against
phifer
was
reversed,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
were
the
same
form
of
information
with
the
--
while
this
may
have
turned
on
1231,
everything
was
set
aside
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
same
evidence
was
not
enough
to
sustain
a
conviction
under
the
complaint
against
phifer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
narbit,
doesn't,
i
do
not
know,
i
am
just
looking,
i
do
not
have
the
middlebrooks
opinion,
but
the
state's
brief
quotes
an
excerpt
from
that
opinion,
in
which
the
court
says
that
the
construction
requiring
also
the
blocking
of
free
passage,
it
is
the
construction
they
had
given
in
both
phifer
and
shuttlesworth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
quite
aside
mr.
narbit,
is
it
possible
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
saying
in
middlebrooks
was
that
the
factual
setting
in
shuttlesworth
was
that
shuttlesworth
was
blocking
traffic.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
that,
is
it
the
boycott
you
mentioned
earlier?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
nabrit,
on
this
last
point,
page
17
of
the
record,
the
ones
that
were
walking
along
there,
were
they
able
to
walk
down
the
street
without
any
obstruction,
this
byars,
no
sir.
on
some
occasions,
people
who
were
walking
in
an
easterly
direction
on
the
north
side
of
second
avenue,
had
to
go
into
the
street
to
get
around
the
people
who
were
standing
there.
i
take
it
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
referring
to
which
side
of
the
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
mcbee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
there
been
other
prosecutions
under
these
ordinances?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
i
understand
you
to
answer
i
think
justice
black
there
have
been
other
prosecutions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
anyone
get
six
months
for
violation
or
any
of
these
before?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
ever
heard
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
that's
why
there
haven't
been
any
appeals.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
might
have
got
only
a
fine
let's
say,
i
suppose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
could
pay
it.
