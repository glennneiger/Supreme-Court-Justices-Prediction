shuttlesworth,
petitioner,
versus
city
of
birmingham.
mr.

you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
sentence
did
they
give
phifer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
six
months
of
hard
labor
and
a
$100.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcbee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
officer
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
testimony
that
no
one
had
moved
at
that
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
where
do
we
find
it
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
as
i
read
this
on
page
18,
it
says
that
did
you
observe
the
defendants
in
the
group
for
any
length
of
time,
answer
and
in
my
best
judgment
for
a
minute
to
a
minute-and-a-half
while
he
stood.
question:
what
did
you
do
then
after
observing
them
with
anything.
answer:
i
walked
out
of
the
store
and
informed
a
group
of
people
they
would
have
to
move
on
and
clear
the
sidewalks
so
as
to
allow
free
passage
and
not
to
obstruct
it.
what
did
you
tell
them,
again
please?
i
told
them
they
would
have
to
move
on
and
clear
the
sidewalk?
what
did
they
do,
if
any
thing?
well,
some
of
the
group
began
to
move
gradually
away.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcbee,
may
i
ask
you
what
mr.
shuttlesworth
did
in
violation
of
the
law
that
mr.
phifer
didn't
do
on
this
occasion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
am
just
asking
you
i
don't--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
they
do
according
to
the
evidence
that
phifer
didn't
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
was
--
what
crime
did
he
commit
and
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
vehicular
traffic?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no
i
am
talking
about
the
trial
courts
and
the
evidence
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
neither
do
we
have
anyway
of
knowing,
do
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
my
point
is
this.
if
phifer
is
not
guilty
under
this
charge
and
this
conviction,
how
can
we
convict
shuttlesworth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
trial
court
found
that
he
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
convicted
of
the
very
same
offenses
that
mr.
shuttlesworth
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
was
convicted
at
the
very
same
offenses
that
the
trial
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
the
complaint
say?
didn't
the
complaint
charged
him
with
blocking
traffic?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
was
he
tried
for,
he
was
tried
for
that,
yes
he
was
tried
for
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
convicted
of
that
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
how
can
you
say
that
he
wasn't
arrested
for
that
reason?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcbee
how
wide
is
this
sidewalk
at
that
particular
place.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
far
is
this
corner
from
the
court
house
that
shuttlesworth
came
from?
chief
justice
earl
warren
three
or
four
blocks?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
do
i
understand
this
is
was
the
same
day
that
the
united
states
district
court
dismissed
the
other
complaints
against
him
in
accordance
with
the
mandate
of
this
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
i
understood
mr.
nabrit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see
mr.
nabrit
shook
his
head.
i'm
probably
wrong
about
it
too.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
nabrit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
wide?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
one
they
were
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
they
--
were
they
at
the
time
of
the
crowd
was
assembled,
were
they
on
the
12th
street
side
or
the
22
foot
side?
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
the
street
on
the
--?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
because
he
did
not
pay
the
$100
--
$100
fine,
it
was
52
days
more,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no.
i
didn't
say
that,
i
said
he
got
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
and
having
not
already
determined
that
because
he
has
not
paid
the
fine,
then
he
has
to
serve
52
days
at
$0.75
a
day.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
