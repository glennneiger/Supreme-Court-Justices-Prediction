back
to
your
colloquy
a
few
moments
ago
with
justice
white.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
is
this
matter
left
in
your
mind
now?
do
you
think
that
we
should
take
this
case
as
involving
convictions
on
the
both
counts
or
as
you
first
indicated
at
least
as
i
understood
you
that
we
can't
tell
whether
the
conviction
rested
on
both
counts.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
latter?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
how
do
you
think
we
should
take
as
representing
the
state,
because
you
said
two
opposite
things.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
heard
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
you
thought,
the
proper
thing
to
do
is,
on
this
record
was
to
say
or
us
to
say
that
we
could
not
tell
whether
the
conviction
was
on
the
both
counts
or
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
understand
that
because
when
you
say
that
you
think
we
probably
have
to
say
on
this
record
we
cannot
tell
whether
it
is
on
both
counts
and
i
do
don't
see
how
we
can
go
along
and
say
well,
we
have
to
assume
that
it
will.
