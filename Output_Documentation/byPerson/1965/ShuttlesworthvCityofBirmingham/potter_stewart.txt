justice
potter
stewart
he
didn't
know
him
or
didn't
recognize
him
or
both?
justice
potter
stewart
but
his
conviction
was
reversed,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
on
the
same
charge?
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
suppose
mr.
nabrit
that
if
we
accept
these
findings
on
page
138
to
the
effect
the
presence
of
this
petitioner
and
his
friends
on
the
street
necessitated
other
people
on
the
sidewalk
going
out
into
the
street
that
by
implication
of
the
court
is
saying
that
this
interfered
with
vehicular
traffic
along
the
street,
that's
what
i
had
done.
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
that
the
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
back
then
that
particular
case
seems
to
have
involved
a
what
was
it,
a
selective
buying
campaign?
justice
potter
stewart
which
i
would
presume
or
guess
was
a
partial
boycott
or
selective
boycott.
justice
potter
stewart
and
which
would
involve
not
going
into
stores
i
should
think
rather
going
into
them,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
was
the
â€“
here
apparently
the
petitioner
wanted
to
go
into
the
store.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
it
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
the
case,
but
i
was
just
curios
as
to
what
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
as
i
have
the
same
impression
as
my
brother
fortas
has
suggested
that
he
does
make
a
very
serious
complaint
as
the
constitutionally
of
1231
not
as
it
is
now
been
limited,
and
confined
to
traffic,
vehicular
traffic
cases,
but
as
it
applied
to
him
at
the
time
of
this
arrest.
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
and
failure
t
notify
him.
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
have
these
ordinances
been
on
the
books
down
there
in
birmingham?
justice
potter
stewart
30
or
more
years.
justice
potter
stewart
i
asked
because
--
it
rather
interested
me
that
they
hadn't
been
construed
until
the
last
year
or
two.
how
many
--
have
been
routinely
a
good
many
convictions
under
these.
justice
potter
stewart
because
it's
wasn't
until
after
certiorari
was
granted
in
this
case
as
i
understand
it
that
one
of
these
ordinances
that
is
1142
was
construed
to
mean
that
the
illegality
of
standing
or
loitering
on
a
street
was
only
relevant
in
connection
with
having
previously
blocked
the
sidewalk,
block
the
respective
sideway,
that's
the
meadowbrook
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
came
after
certiorari
was
filed
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
not
until
the
phifer
case
that
i
understand
it,
1231
was
construed
to
be
confined
to
vehicular
traffic.
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
would
suggest,
i
would
guess
that
there
haven't
been
many
or
it
maybe
any
convictions
under
these
statutes
until
recently.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
kind
of
a
legacy
statute,
that's
a
little
bit
different,
the
common
loitering
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
the
way
it
has
been
for
example,
but
i
would
suggest
there
maybe
other
ordinances
having
to
do
with
legacy
of
the
town.
justice
potter
stewart
would
there
be
any
record
anywhere,
i
suppose
this
isn't
a
court
of
record
there
wouldn't
be
any
record
anywhere
of
the
convictions
of
these
ordinances?
justice
potter
stewart
so
unless
there
was
an
appeal,
there
wouldn't
be
anyway
of
our
knowing
any
of
this.
justice
potter
stewart
because
it
hasn't
been
and
i'm
right,
am
i
not
in
my
understanding
that
it
hasn't
been
until
the
last
year
or
two
that
these
ordinances
have
been
construed
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
construed
by
any
court
of
record
or
anything
for
which
we
have
a
record.
justice
potter
stewart
then
there
is
a
trial
de
novo
there.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
that
is
a
court
of
record.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
mr.
nabrit
say
that
he
also
testified
that
he
didn't
know
whether
or
not
they
were
colored
people.
justice
potter
stewart
they
are
colored,
aren't
they?
