mr.
j.
robert
sparks
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
associate
justices,
i
am
going
to
make
my
argument
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
if
this
court
reaches
the
merits.
georgia
insists
as
mr.
mcpherson
ably
argued
yesterday
that
this
case
should
not
even
be
here
in
the
first
place
because
a
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
16
days
after
the
district
court's
order
of
remand.
however,
in
the
event
the
court
disagrees
with
our
position,
i
am
going
to
try
to
briefly
state
that
the
position
of
the
state
of
georgia
in
this
matter.
as
the
court
is
undoubtedly
aware,
this
is
a
--
an
extremely
complex
problem
of
construction
of
the
removal
statute,
the
so-called
civil
rights
removal
statute
which
is
at
28
u.s.c.
1443.
it
dates
back
to
the
reconstruction
congress
in
1866,
the
first
civil
rights
act
enacted
right
after
the
conclusion
of
the
war
between
the
states
granting
a
right
of
removal
to
any
person
who
is
unable
to
enforce
or
has
denied
his
rights
in
the
--
in
a
state
court
under
any
right
of
any
law
providing
for
equal
civil
rights
of
all
citizens
of
the
united
states.
now
in
1880,
we
have
the
first
definitive
construction
of
that
statute
in
two
cases
by
this
honorable
court,
strauder
versus
west
virginia
in
100
u.s.
303
and
virginia
versus
rives
in
100
u.s.
313
both
decided
the
same
day.
there
was
one
essential
difference
between
the
two
cases.
both
cases
involved
and
alleged
deprivation
by
negro
defendants
charged
with
capital
offenses
in
west
virginia
and
in
virginia.
their
complaint
--
the
reason
by
which
they
claim
the
right
to
remove
the
cases
from
state
court
to
the
federal
circuit
court
at
that
time
was
a
deprivation
or
a
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
traverse
jury.
now
in
the
strauder
case,
west
virginia
at
that
time
had
a
provision
in
their
constitution
which
limited
electors
to
white
persons
with
certain
other
qualifications
and
then
they
had
a
statute
which
in
time
said
that
only
electors
could
serve
as
grand
jurors
and
traverse
jurors.
on
the
other
hand,
virginia
had
no
such
statute
or
a
provision
in
their
constitution.
the
allegation
in
the
virginia
case
was
that
jury
commissioners,
judges,
and
state
officials
were
systematically
excluding
negroes
from
traverse
and
grand
jurors
although
not
required
to
do
so
by
statute.
at
that
time,
this
honorable
court
held
in
the
strauder
case
that
removal
was
a
problem
and
should've
been
granted
to
reverse
to
conviction.
the
strauder
case
reached
this
honorable
court
through
the
usual
procedure
of
appeal
to
the
state
courts
and
certiorari
to
the
highest
court
of
that
state.
now,
virginia
filed
a
writ
of
a
petition
in
this
honorable
court
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
against
circuit
judge
rives,
who
had
accepted
a
petition
for
removal
and
it
writ
--
and
it
issued
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
had
denied
a
--
excuse
me,
i
don't
think
virginia
even
filed
a
motion,
a
petition
to
remand.
they
just
went
--
came
straight
to
this
court
for
an
order
of
mandamus.
and
this
honorable
court
in
the
unanimous
decision
held
in
virginia
versus
rives
that
in
order
for
a
defendant
to
remove
his
case
under
the
civil
rights
statute
that
there
must
be
a
discrimination
set
out
by
the
state
statute
or
a
state
ordinance
that
any
alleged
discrimination
or
denial
of
equal
rights
by
any
person
else
other
than
by
state
statute
was
not
removable
and
that
the
proper
remedy
for
such
defendants
was
to
defend
themselves
through
the
state
courts
or
preserve
their
right
--
their
federal
right
and
then
apply
to
this
honorable
court
for
certiorari.
and
your
honor
--
and
your
honors,
georgia
stands
today
on
the
virginia
versus
rives
case
and
seven
other
cases
decided
by
this
honorable
court
beginning
in
1880
and
going
through
1906,
kentucky
versus
powers
being
the
last
expression
on
this
subject
in
201
u.s.
at
page
1.
eight
consecutive
case
rulings
of
this
court
has
held
the
same
thing
that
is
that
there
must
be
a
state's
statute
which
prevents
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right.
a
state
statute
which
is
either
unconstitutional
or
which
denies
a
defendant
in
the
state
court
an
equal
right.
this
is
the
first
time
that
this
issue
has
reached
this
honorable
court
since
1906.
as
i
said,
georgia
stands
on
those
eight
decisions
of
this
honorable
court
plus
four
courts
of
appeal
which
have
held
the
same
--
to
the
same
effect
three
of
them
within
the
last
two
years.
the
three
that
i
refer
to
in
the
last
two
years
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
versus
galamison
and
incidentally,
this
honorable
court
denied
certiorari
in
that
case.
city
of
chester,
south
carolina
versus
anderson,
that's
in
the
--
that's
by
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
a
recent
decision
by
a
court
of
--
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir,
you're
right.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that's
right.
it's
chester,
pennsylvania,
excuse
me.
and
the
fourth
circuit
case
is
baines
versus
the
city
of
danville,
virginia.
that
case
is
only
recently
been
decided
by
a
majority
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
i
believe
in
february,
it
hasn't
come
out
in
the
advance
sheets
yet.
and
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
some
slightly
older
cases,
hull
versus
jackson
county
circuit
court
and
snypp
versus
ohio,
the
first
of
those
cases
in
138
f.2d.
at
820
and
the
second
in
70
f.2d
at
535.
those
four
circuits
have
all
followed
the
rives-powers
line
of
cases
and
from
henceforth
in
this
argument,
i
will
refer
to
the
previous
decisions
as
rives-powers
which
includes
neal
against
delaware,
gibson
against
mississippi,
murray
versus
louisiana,
bush
versus
kentucky,
williams
versus
mississippi.
in
addition
your
honors,
ever
since
the
kentucky
versus
powers
case,
district
courts
in
12
states
have
universally
and
without
exception
followed
the
powers
ruling.
virtually
all
of
this
--
the
states
of
the
south
including
new
york,
michigan,
these
are
outside
of
the
south
i
should
say,
new
york,
michigan,
pennsylvania,
california,
and
new
jersey
have
universally
refused
to
entertain
removal
petitions
or
have
properly
remanded
them
on
a
petition
for
remand
was
filed
by
a
discriminatory
state
statute.
it
was
not
alleged
in
the
petition
for
removal.
now,
this
is
the
first
case.
this
is
the
first
case
which
departs
from
this
long
line
of
federal
cases.
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
rachel
case
by
three
panel
court
which
was
split
three
ways.
there
were
three
opinions
written,
one
opinion
for
the
court
written
by
chief
judge
tuttle,
one
opinion
for
--
by
district
judge
white,
who
is
to
--
was
sitting
by
designation.
district
judge
white
first
agreed
with
mr.
mcpherson's
argument
that
the
cases
were
not
--
the
appeals
were
not
timely
filed
and
said
that
rule
37
(a)
(2)
does
apply
in
the
case
you
should
have
been
dismissed.
the
appeal
should
have
been
dismissed
and
he
adhered
to
that
on
rehearing.
a
district
judge
or
circuit
court
judge
griffin
bell
agreed
with
the
majority
of
the
court
as
the
appeal
was
timely
filed
and
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
to
the
district
court
for
a
hearing
but
he
differed
sharply
with
what
should
be
done
at
the
hearing.
the
fifth
circuit
majority
opinion
directed
the
district
court
to
have
a
hearing
and
to
dismiss
the
prosecutions
if
one
single
criteria
were
found
and
that
is
that
the
respondents
were
removed
from
the
places
of
public
accommodation
for
racial
reasons
alone
basing
it
of
course
on
this
court's
holding
in
hamm
versus
the
city
of
rock
hill.
a
district
--
circuit
court
judge
bell
sharply
disagreed.
he
said
that
this
constituted
in
his
opinion,
a
breach
of
the
principles
of
federalism
as
he
knew
it
that
such
casual
treatment
of
the
georgia
courts
posed
--
presented
a
problem
of
jeopardy
of
the
relationships
between
state
and
federal
courts.
judge
bell
said
that,
if
the
cases
were
remanded
to
the
district
court
that
the
respondents
should
be
required
to
prove
that
they
cannot
receive
a
fair
trial
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
georgia.
now,
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
say
a
word
about
that.
they
just
said,
"take
the
case
back
and
if
you
find
that
race
was
involved
in
the
removal,
dismiss
the
prosecution."
that
gives
the
court
no
chance
--
the
district
court
no
chance
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
facts
of
each
particular
case
and
there
103
cases
pending
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
alone,
involving
some
20
demonstrations
in
places
all
over
atlanta
city
in
demonstrations.
this
court
in
hamm
versus
rock
hill,
of
course,
held
that
a
person
cannot
be
punished
or
prosecuted
for
peaceable,
non-forcible
exercise
of
the
rights
granted
them
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
with
respect
to
public
accommodations.
but
that
does
not
include
all
conduct
which
might
take
place
in
those
places.
another
thing
which
we
--
i
particularly
want
to
call
to
this
court's
attention
is
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
has
followed
the
hamm
versus
rock
hill
decision
of
this
honorable
court
in
a
unanimous
decision
by
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
bolton
versus
the
state
of
georgia.
the
georgia
supreme
court
discussed
the
decision
of
this
court
in
hamm
versus
rock
hill
and
abated
a
series
of
trespass
convictions
which
arose
from
a
sit-in
or
a
demonstration
in
an
athens
georgia
restaurant.
judge
bell
said,
the
dissenting
judge
of
the
fifth
circuit
panel,
"that
the
georgia
court
should
have
a
chance
to
pass
upon
these
cases
in
light
of
the
fact
of
the
decision
in
the
bolton
case.
the
fact
that
they
held
--
recognized
in
authoring
the
decisions
of
this
court."
i
might
add
parenthetically
your
honors
that
up
until
three
years
ago,
i
was
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
the
northern
district
of
georgia,
back,
i
was
the
first
assistant
for
several
years
and
i've
been
on
both
sides
of
this
removal
question.
i've
on
occasion
had
to
remove
cases
from
state
to
federal
court
under
section
1442
where
federal
officers
were
charged
for
offenses
committed
in
the
performance
or
in
the
color
of
their
office.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
is
a
radical
departure
from
all
of
the
decisions
of
this
honorable
court
on
the
question
of
removal
and
i'm
talking
about
removal
and
not
for
the
defendant's
or
the
respondents
would
be
convicted
if
they
were
tried
in
the
state
court
but
simply
on
the
basic
question
of
whether
or
not
a
person
can
allege
that
in
a
pure
conclusion
as
they
did
in
the
rachel
petition.
if
the
court
--
i'm
certain
the
court
will
read
the
rachel
petition,
you
will
see
that
it
is
nothing
but
conclusions.
they
alleged
only
the
facts
that
20
people
were
arrested
in
this
place,
this
place,
and
this
place
and
so
they
were
arrested
while
attempting
to
exercise
their
right
to
seek
food,
comfort,
and
the
entertainment
at
these
public
restaurants.
now
at
the
time
this
petition
was
filed,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
had
not
been
enacted
in
the
law.
then
they
--
well,
then
they
alleged
in
one
sentence
that
the
state
of
georgia
by
statute
custom,
usage
and
practice,
supports
and
maintains
a
policy
of
racial
discrimination.
then
they
alleged
that
they
cannot
enforce
that
they
are
denied
their
rights
and
cannot
enforce
their
rights
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
georgia
before
any
action
is
taken
against
any
of
these
persons
before
trial.
they
do
not
allege
a
single
discriminatory
act
by
a
judge.
they
do
not
dis
--
allege
any
oppressive
act
by
any
prosecuting
attorney.
they
simply
said,
"because
we
were
arrested,
we
conclude
that
georgia
practices
such
a
policy
of
racial
discrimination."
they
do
not
even
allege
that
the
statute,
the
trespass
statute
under
which
they're
being
prosecuted
as
either
unconstitutional
or
being
unconstitutionally
applied
as
to
them.
district
judge
boyd
sloan
who
has
recently
retired
from
the
bench
but
who
has
been
both
the
state
and
federal
court
judge
for
about
40
years.
he
promptly
remanded
the
next
day
after
it
was
filed.
he
remanded
all
the
cases
stating
and
relying
upon
all
of
these
prior
decisions
of
the
appellate
courts
and
of
this
honorable
court,
the
rives-powers
line
of
cases
that
it
did
not
set
out
grounds
for
removal.
now
the
respondents
in
this
case,
i
believe
mr.
amsterdam
wrote
the
brief,
i'm
so
informed
and
incidentally
it
was
a
very
excellent
brief.
it
--
he's
obviously
spent
years
studying
this
situation.
it
goes
back
into
history,
congressional
history
and
so
forth,
but
mr.
amsterdam,
if
he
wrote
the
brief
and
i
understand
that
he
did,
he
claims
that
this
court
can
uphold
the
fifth
circuit
ruling
in
the
rachel
case
without
disturbing
the
rives-powers
line
of
decisions.
and
he
says,
that
is
so
for
this
reason.
he
says
that
the
rives-powers
line
of
cases
are
a
procedural
matter
that
they
protect
a
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
against
a
procedural
matter.
that
is
the
right
to
have
members
of
your
own
race
empanel
on
the
traverse
jury
which
is
to
try
you,
and
that
this
case
is
in
the
rachel
case,
the
right
that
the
petitioners
are
seeking
or
the
respondents
are
seeking
to
preserve
by
removing
the
federal
court
is
a
right
against
prosecution.
and
he
says
that
that
is
a
substantive
right
whereas
the
rives-powers'
line
of
cases
are
a
procedural
right
only
and
therefore,
there's
a
distinction
that
this
court
can
distinguish
rives-power
line
of
authority
from
this
case.
but
i
wish
to
call
the
court's
attention
that
that
isn't
what
the
court
said
--
what
this
honorable
court
said
in
1880.
in
strauder
versus
west
virginia,
the
first
of
the
cases
that
three
--
at
page
309,
the
court
asked
this
rhetorical
question
and
this
was
a
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
is
not
protection
against
a
race
or
a
color
prejudice
in
empanelling
a
jury
a
right,
a
legal
right
under
the
constitutional
amendment.
and
then
they
answered
it
--
that
was
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
course
and
they
answered
it
by
saying,
"if
the
statutes
of
west
virginia
discriminating
as
they
do
in
the
selection
of
jurors
amounts
to
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
to
a
colored
man
when
he
is
put
on
trial
on
alleged
defense
against
a
state."
and
i
submit
that
that
is
a
substantive
right.
i
submit
that
respondents
has
pleading
when
they
say
the
difference
between
removing
a
case
to
the
federal
court
because
you
can't
have
a
person
of
your
own
color
on
the
jury
which
tries
you
in
removing
a
case
because
you
cannot
be
prosecuted
if
you're
within
the
holding
of
hamm
versus
rock
hill.
they
are
both
substantive
rights.
either
one
is
procedural.
one
is
procedural
in
effect
it
--
prosecution
is
going
forward
in
the
rachel
case,
prosecution
was
going
forward
and
it
was
a
question
of
state
procedure
there.
again,
mr.
amsterdam
or
the
respondents
say
on
page
95
of
their
brief
and
this
is
the
essence
of
the
case
as
i
see
it.
they
said
that
defendants
prosecuted
for
the
exercise
of
the
right,
the
equal
public
accommodations
granted
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
may
remove
the
prosecutions
to
a
federal
district
court
whether
the
statute
under
which
they
are
charged
violates
those
rights
on
its
face
or
as
applied.
in
other
words,
the
respondents
are
saying
if
they
have
an
absolute
right
to
remove
the
case
regardless
of
whether
the
statute
is
being
constitutionally
applied
or
is
constitutional
on
its
face.
in
fact,
in
the
brief,
the
respondents,
they
argue
that
persons
prosecuted
in
the
exercise
of
the
rights
granted
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
are
insulated
from
the
prosecuted
process.
and
i
don't
believe
that
mr.
amsterdam
will
quarrel
with
those
words.
he
uses
the
term
insulation
several
times
that
they
simply
cannot
be
prosecuted
and
i
res
--
most
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
if
the
court
should
abduct
the
respondent's
theory
in
this
respect,
it
would
create
a
virtual
no
man's
land
in
law
enforcement
in
cases
arising
or
possibly
arising
in
the
future
out
of
this
act.
mr.
amsterdam
apparently
contends
for
the
respondents
that
if
a
person
is
arrested
in
a
place
of
public
accommodation
that
before
he
gets
to
the
jailhouse
he
can
--
his
lawyers
can
file
a
removal
petition
and
he
will
be
brought
into
federal
court.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
because
he
says
that
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
taken
into
conjunction
with
hamm
versus
rock
hill
insulates
them
against
prosecution
at
all.
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
that
would
leave
the
states
and
the
federal
law
enforcement
officials
in
acquiring
the
risk
as
to
how
to
proceed.
if
i
might
pose
a
hypothetical
question,
hypothetical
situation,
suppose
that
a
number
of
demonstrators
seeking
to
exercise
their
right
to
eat
in
a
restaurant
or
formally
integrated
restaurant
and
incidentally,
there
are
very
few
of
those
in
the
south
anymore,
atlanta,
georgia
is
completely
integrated,
as
integrated
as
washington
d.c.
but
if
they
went
in
and
some
persons
on
the
inside
did
not
agree
with
them,
started
a
--
an
argument
and
suppose
that
both
side
started
fighting
and
rioting
on
the
inside.
suppose
that
the
demonstrators
themselves
were
fighting,
who
would
move
then
to
control
that
if
this
court
says
that
the
demonstrators
are
insulated
from
prosecution,
from
state
prosecution.
certainly,
the
federal
could
not
move
in
because
federal
law
enforcement
officers
cannot
move
in
unless
they
authorize
by
specific
statute
to
--
and
given
criminal
jurisdictions
as
the
fbi
and
the
internal
revenue
or
the
state
official
certainly
would
be
ought
to
move
in
because
they
would
have
the
idea
that
if
they
are
making
a
case
to
be
carried
to
the
federal
court.
i
most
honestly
submit
to
the
court
that
this
isn't
a
matter
of
grave
importance
to
the
whole
country
at
large.
i
have
mentioned
to
say
that
thousands
of
cases
are
of
state
court
prosecutions
will
rest
on
what
this
court
says,
a
103
in
georgia
alone
are
pending.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
no,
sir.
i
do
not
know
what
the
total
figure
is
but
i
know
that
there
are
number
of
district
courts
(inaudible)
are
reserving
rulings
that
--
i
know
that
there
are
number
pending
in
greenwood
versus
peacock
which
is
following
me
in
argument.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
your
honor,
mississippi
and
georgia
is
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
the
--
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
--
that's
the
difference
between
peacock
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
and
rachel.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
that's
the
federal
law
which
is
involved.
the
difference
between
rachel
and
peacock
and
i'm
not
trying
to
undermine
my
sister
state
of
mississippi
because
they've
helped
me
and
i've
helped
them
in
the
briefing
on
this
case
but
rachel
stands
on
a
different
footing
from
peacock
in
these
respects,
answering
justice
white's
question.
in
the
rachel
case,
the
petition
is
grossly
inadequate
for
removal.
the
petition
in
peacock
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
alleges
that
the
mississippi
(inaudible)
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
not
very
many
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
not
very
many,
your
honor,
in
the
largest
cities
such
as
atlanta
and
birmingham,
i
assume
places
like
that
but
throughout
the
south
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
there
are
many
smaller
places
in
which
prosecution
might
be
commenced.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes.
there's
some
are
pending.
i
think
most
of
them
are
--
they
are
pending
in
the
district
courts
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
they've
been
--
they've
been
removed
to
the
district
court.
your
honor,
some
of
them
undoubtedly
will
be
dismissed
whether
they
go
back
to
the
state
court
or
whether
they
stay
in
the
federal
court.
some
however
go
beyond
the
holding
in
hamm
and
lupper.
some
involved
violence
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
on
the
part
of
the
demonstrators'
acts
of
vandalism
in
the
place
--
in
restaurants
which
i
do
not
believe
this
court
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
insulated
in
hamm
and
lupper.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
it
could,
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
argument
over
the
scope
and
that
is
one
of
the
points
which
we
specifically
make
in
our
brief
that
in
the
event
we
don't
prevail
at
all
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
that
the
district
court
at
least
should
be
allowed
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
cases
fall
within
hamm
(inaudible)
--
hamm
and
lupper.
if
so,
they
are
protected,
its
protected
conduct
but
if
they
are
outside
the
peaceable
non-violence
scope
of
hamm
and
lupper
then
they
should
be
remanded
to
the
state
court
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
and
that's
what
the
district
--
circuit
court
bell
said.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
i
feel
that
the
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
i
think
so
because
otherwise
you
will
have
your
federal
district
courts
trying
municipal
court
cases,
disorderly
conduct
and
things
like
that.
the
federal
district
courts
are
flooded
with
the
(inaudible).
and
i've
--
i'm
just
expressing
an
opinion
but
i
don't
think
the
federal
district
courts
want
those
cases
because
uniformly,
they
remand
them
when
the
state
ask
for
them
to
be
remanded.
of
course,
i
know
that
the
district
courts
will
entertain
them
if
they're
directed
to
or
if
this
court
decides
that
they
should.
this
contention
of
the
appellants
virtually
amounts
to
creating
an
original
trial
of
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court.
it's
like
asking
this
court
by
judicial
decree
to
--
decree
a
new
type
of
federal
jurisdiction
that
federal
district
courts
will
entertain
all
cases
arising
under
the
civil
rights
act
commenced
by
state
prosecution.
and
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that
does
not
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
didn't
hear
the
first
part
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
of
the
question
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
they
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir,
they
would
--
in
georgia
it's
called
the
plea
and
abatement.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
would
say
that
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
would
certainly
dismiss
under
bolton
against
the
state
of
georgia.
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
held
it.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
you
would
not
have
a
trial.
you
would
merely
have
a
hearing.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
if
they
--
if
they
went
beyond
the
scope
of
hamm
versus
lupper
then
there
would
be
a
jury
trial
of
questions
as
to
whether
they
violated
or
trial
before
the
court
without
a
jury
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
sir?
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
you
would
have
a
trial
then.
my
light
is
flashed.
i
want
to
call
attention
to
the
court
to
one
other
thing
if
i
might
take
just
one
minute.
and
that
is
that
the
construction
that
is
sought
by
this
court
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
it
wasn't?
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir,
that
was
my
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
haven't
figured
out
these
lights
yet.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
saw
the
red
one
flashed
just
then
and
i
thought
my
time
was
up
but
i
just
had
one
other
thing
to
say
your
honors.
the
action
which
i
--
the
respondents
are
asking
this
court
to
take
today
is
one
that
they
tried
to
get
enacted
in
the
law
in
1964,
when
the
1964
civil
rights
act
was
passed.
house
resolution
--
h.r.
7702
was
introduced
by
mr.
kastenmeier
and
it
is
sought
to
amend
section
1443
using
these
words,
“the
right
of
removal
under
this
section
shall
be
freely
sustained
and
this
section
shall
be
construed
to
apply
to
any
state
action,
executive,
legislative
or
administrative,
or
otherwise
having
the
effect
of
denial
or
infringement
of
equal
rights
and
congress
did
not
so
amend
the
statute,
and
that
is
what
in
effect
the
respondent's
are
asking
this
court
to
do
judicially
when
congress
did
not
do
it
--
did
not
pass
the
act
in
that
form.”
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
no,
sir,
it
is
not.
i
did
not
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
know
about
it
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
it
is
house
resolution
7702.
my
colleagues
from
mississippi
told
me
about
it
yesterday
when
i
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
it's
in
the
peacock
reply
brief.
i
understand
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
the
district
court
proceeded
on
the
grounds
that
the
--
if
the
removal
petition
itself
does
not
set
out
grounds
that
it
should
be
remanded
and
that
has
been
the
practice
in
many
of
the
--
well,
in
practically
all
of
the
federal
courts.
it
has
not
been
the
practice
for
the
courts
to
--
for
the
district
courts
to
hold
hearings
if
they
read
the
removal
petition
like
a
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
pleading
i
mean.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
alright,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
the
district
court
just
says
that
the
respondents
have
not
shown
--
did
not
allege
that
any
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
they
have
not
pointed
to
any
statute
in
anyway
abridges
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
they
did
not
go
beyond
that.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
if
you
--
if
the
court
should
hold
that,
i
think
that
would
be
--
your
honor
is
right.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
no,
sir.
the
district
court
has
not
passed
on
that
and
under
the
present
ruling
of
the
fifth
circuit
he
can't
pass
on
anything
except
whether
or
not
race
was
involved
in
the
removal
of
the
persons
from
the
places
of
public
accommodation.
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
guidance
is
badly
needed
and
i'm
certain,
the
court
will
give
guidance
in
this
field
but
state
authorities
don't
know
what
to
do
and
the
federal
district
courts
don't
know
what
to
do.
this
is
a
relatively
new
problem
although
age
old
but,
i
mean,
in
its
present
facet.
now,
we
respectfully
submit
that
georgia
can
handle
these
cases
fairly
or
we
have
--
our
supreme
court
has
followed
hamm
and
lupper.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
and
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
your
honor,
i
can't
answer
that
categorically
because
i
said,
this
covers
about
20
cases
and
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
evidence
in
all
of
the
cases
but
i
can
say
this,
in
some
instances,
i
think
that
the
conduct
would
be
covered
by
hamm
versus
lupper,
i
mean,
it
would
be
insulated.
some
demonstrations
were
peaceful.
others
involved
pushing,
shoving,
kicking
by
the
demonstrators.
they
tried
to
force
their
way
in
to
one
restaurant,
formed
a
flying
wedge
and
rushed
the
door,
kicked
the
proprietor
on
his
leg
and
so
forth.
that
type,
i
do
not
believe
would
be
covered
by
hamm
versus
lupper.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
well,
your
honor
there
was
a
--
there
a
hundred
and
one
of
them
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
there
were
a
hundred
and
one
of
them
indicted
and
before
only
two
of
them
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
only
two
got
tried
and
then
the
whole
batch
was
removed
over
the
federal
court
and
we've
been
fighting
the
question
of
removability
ever
since.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir,
that's
true.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
well,
your
honor,
they've
--
the
district
court
hadn't
had
jurisdiction
of
this
case
so
that
they
can
be
dismissed
from
that
time.
it's
been
on
appeal
ever
since.
it
was
on
appeal
when
hamm
and
lupper
came
down
so
--
i
mean
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
no,
sir.
i
mean,
the
federal
district
court
has
not
had
jurisdiction
of
these
cases.
are
they
--
they've
been
on
appeal
ever
since.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
no,
sir.
going
up
through
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
they
were
pending
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
no,
sir.
they
haven't
had
them
--
they
haven't
had
them
before
them
because
they've
been
on
appeal
all
this
time.
they
remit
it
to
or
the
mandate
has
never
gone
back
from
the
fifth
circuit
pending
the
appeal
to
be
certiorari
to
this
court.
so,
no
one
has
jurisdiction
of
them
now
except
this
honorable
court.
as
a
manner
of
speaking
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes.
i
don't
think
you
can
miss
--
dismiss
a
case,
its
own
appeal
because
until
the
mandate
is
returned,
the
cases
are
not
--
the
district
court
has
no
power
to
enter
on
all
of
them.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
but
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
don't
know
your
honor.
we
are
saying
that
what
--
our
position
is
if
we
want
to
get
them
back
in
a
state
court
and
let
us
dispose
of
them
in
the
state
court.
we
feel
that
they
were
improperly
removed
and
when
we
get
them
back
we'll
dispose
of
them
justly.
those
that
need
to
be
dismissed,
we
will
dismiss
them
in
a
state
court,
and
those
which
may
need
to
be
tried,
we'll
try
them
in
the
state
court
--
in
a
state
court.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
this
is
purely
a
question
of
jurisdiction
that
we
are
arguing
right
now
and
not
the
merits
of
the
case,
i
couldn't
tell
you
what
the
merits
of
any
particular
case
was.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
and
to
the
extent
if
they
should
be
prosecuted,
they
will
be
prosecuted.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that's
in
our
position.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
they're
all
in
the
courts
but
then
--
but
none
of
them
are
in
the
state
courts.
they're
all
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
and
as
i
say,
it's
been
on
appeal
continuously
for
about
18
months.
and
even
the
district
court
--
district
court
does
have
jurisdiction
of
the
two
which
were
just
removed
last
week.
my
time
is
up
and
i
appreciate
the
courtesy
of
the
court.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
associate
justices,
i
am
going
to
make
my
argument
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
if
this
court
reaches
the
merits.
georgia
insists
as
mr.
mcpherson
ably
argued
yesterday
that
this
case
should
not
even
be
here
in
the
first
place
because
a
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
16
days
after
the
district
court's
order
of
remand.
however,
in
the
event
the
court
disagrees
with
our
position,
i
am
going
to
try
to
briefly
state
that
the
position
of
the
state
of
georgia
in
this
matter.
as
the
court
is
undoubtedly
aware,
this
is
a
--
an
extremely
complex
problem
of
construction
of
the
removal
statute,
the
so-called
civil
rights
removal
statute
which
is
at
28
u.s.c.
1443.
it
dates
back
to
the
reconstruction
congress
in
1866,
the
first
civil
rights
act
enacted
right
after
the
conclusion
of
the
war
between
the
states
granting
a
right
of
removal
to
any
person
who
is
unable
to
enforce
or
has
denied
his
rights
in
the
--
in
a
state
court
under
any
right
of
any
law
providing
for
equal
civil
rights
of
all
citizens
of
the
united
states.
now
in
1880,
we
have
the
first
definitive
construction
of
that
statute
in
two
cases
by
this
honorable
court,
strauder
versus
west
virginia
in
100
u.s.
303
and
virginia
versus
rives
in
100
u.s.
313
both
decided
the
same
day.
there
was
one
essential
difference
between
the
two
cases.
both
cases
involved
and
alleged
deprivation
by
negro
defendants
charged
with
capital
offenses
in
west
virginia
and
in
virginia.
their
complaint
--
the
reason
by
which
they
claim
the
right
to
remove
the
cases
from
state
court
to
the
federal
circuit
court
at
that
time
was
a
deprivation
or
a
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
traverse
jury.
now
in
the
strauder
case,
west
virginia
at
that
time
had
a
provision
in
their
constitution
which
limited
electors
to
white
persons
with
certain
other
qualifications
and
then
they
had
a
statute
which
in
time
said
that
only
electors
could
serve
as
grand
jurors
and
traverse
jurors.
on
the
other
hand,
virginia
had
no
such
statute
or
a
provision
in
their
constitution.
the
allegation
in
the
virginia
case
was
that
jury
commissioners,
judges,
and
state
officials
were
systematically
excluding
negroes
from
traverse
and
grand
jurors
although
not
required
to
do
so
by
statute.
at
that
time,
this
honorable
court
held
in
the
strauder
case
that
removal
was
a
problem
and
should've
been
granted
to
reverse
to
conviction.
the
strauder
case
reached
this
honorable
court
through
the
usual
procedure
of
appeal
to
the
state
courts
and
certiorari
to
the
highest
court
of
that
state.
now,
virginia
filed
a
writ
of
a
petition
in
this
honorable
court
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
against
circuit
judge
rives,
who
had
accepted
a
petition
for
removal
and
it
writ
--
and
it
issued
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
had
denied
a
--
excuse
me,
i
don't
think
virginia
even
filed
a
motion,
a
petition
to
remand.
they
just
went
--
came
straight
to
this
court
for
an
order
of
mandamus.
and
this
honorable
court
in
the
unanimous
decision
held
in
virginia
versus
rives
that
in
order
for
a
defendant
to
remove
his
case
under
the
civil
rights
statute
that
there
must
be
a
discrimination
set
out
by
the
state
statute
or
a
state
ordinance
that
any
alleged
discrimination
or
denial
of
equal
rights
by
any
person
else
other
than
by
state
statute
was
not
removable
and
that
the
proper
remedy
for
such
defendants
was
to
defend
themselves
through
the
state
courts
or
preserve
their
right
--
their
federal
right
and
then
apply
to
this
honorable
court
for
certiorari.
and
your
honor
--
and
your
honors,
georgia
stands
today
on
the
virginia
versus
rives
case
and
seven
other
cases
decided
by
this
honorable
court
beginning
in
1880
and
going
through
1906,
kentucky
versus
powers
being
the
last
expression
on
this
subject
in
201
u.s.
at
page
1.
eight
consecutive
case
rulings
of
this
court
has
held
the
same
thing
that
is
that
there
must
be
a
state's
statute
which
prevents
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right.
a
state
statute
which
is
either
unconstitutional
or
which
denies
a
defendant
in
the
state
court
an
equal
right.
this
is
the
first
time
that
this
issue
has
reached
this
honorable
court
since
1906.
as
i
said,
georgia
stands
on
those
eight
decisions
of
this
honorable
court
plus
four
courts
of
appeal
which
have
held
the
same
--
to
the
same
effect
three
of
them
within
the
last
two
years.
the
three
that
i
refer
to
in
the
last
two
years
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
versus
galamison
and
incidentally,
this
honorable
court
denied
certiorari
in
that
case.
city
of
chester,
south
carolina
versus
anderson,
that's
in
the
--
that's
by
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
a
recent
decision
by
a
court
of
--
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir,
you're
right.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that's
right.
it's
chester,
pennsylvania,
excuse
me.
and
the
fourth
circuit
case
is
baines
versus
the
city
of
danville,
virginia.
that
case
is
only
recently
been
decided
by
a
majority
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
i
believe
in
february,
it
hasn't
come
out
in
the
advance
sheets
yet.
and
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
some
slightly
older
cases,
hull
versus
jackson
county
circuit
court
and
snypp
versus
ohio,
the
first
of
those
cases
in
138
f.2d.
at
820
and
the
second
in
70
f.2d
at
535.
those
four
circuits
have
all
followed
the
rives-powers
line
of
cases
and
from
henceforth
in
this
argument,
i
will
refer
to
the
previous
decisions
as
rives-powers
which
includes
neal
against
delaware,
gibson
against
mississippi,
murray
versus
louisiana,
bush
versus
kentucky,
williams
versus
mississippi.
in
addition
your
honors,
ever
since
the
kentucky
versus
powers
case,
district
courts
in
12
states
have
universally
and
without
exception
followed
the
powers
ruling.
virtually
all
of
this
--
the
states
of
the
south
including
new
york,
michigan,
these
are
outside
of
the
south
i
should
say,
new
york,
michigan,
pennsylvania,
california,
and
new
jersey
have
universally
refused
to
entertain
removal
petitions
or
have
properly
remanded
them
on
a
petition
for
remand
was
filed
by
a
discriminatory
state
statute.
it
was
not
alleged
in
the
petition
for
removal.
now,
this
is
the
first
case.
this
is
the
first
case
which
departs
from
this
long
line
of
federal
cases.
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
rachel
case
by
three
panel
court
which
was
split
three
ways.
there
were
three
opinions
written,
one
opinion
for
the
court
written
by
chief
judge
tuttle,
one
opinion
for
--
by
district
judge
white,
who
is
to
--
was
sitting
by
designation.
district
judge
white
first
agreed
with
mr.
mcpherson's
argument
that
the
cases
were
not
--
the
appeals
were
not
timely
filed
and
said
that
rule
37
(a)
(2)
does
apply
in
the
case
you
should
have
been
dismissed.
the
appeal
should
have
been
dismissed
and
he
adhered
to
that
on
rehearing.
a
district
judge
or
circuit
court
judge
griffin
bell
agreed
with
the
majority
of
the
court
as
the
appeal
was
timely
filed
and
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
to
the
district
court
for
a
hearing
but
he
differed
sharply
with
what
should
be
done
at
the
hearing.
the
fifth
circuit
majority
opinion
directed
the
district
court
to
have
a
hearing
and
to
dismiss
the
prosecutions
if
one
single
criteria
were
found
and
that
is
that
the
respondents
were
removed
from
the
places
of
public
accommodation
for
racial
reasons
alone
basing
it
of
course
on
this
court's
holding
in
hamm
versus
the
city
of
rock
hill.
a
district
--
circuit
court
judge
bell
sharply
disagreed.
he
said
that
this
constituted
in
his
opinion,
a
breach
of
the
principles
of
federalism
as
he
knew
it
that
such
casual
treatment
of
the
georgia
courts
posed
--
presented
a
problem
of
jeopardy
of
the
relationships
between
state
and
federal
courts.
judge
bell
said
that,
if
the
cases
were
remanded
to
the
district
court
that
the
respondents
should
be
required
to
prove
that
they
cannot
receive
a
fair
trial
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
georgia.
now,
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
say
a
word
about
that.
they
just
said,
"take
the
case
back
and
if
you
find
that
race
was
involved
in
the
removal,
dismiss
the
prosecution."
that
gives
the
court
no
chance
--
the
district
court
no
chance
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
facts
of
each
particular
case
and
there
103
cases
pending
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
alone,
involving
some
20
demonstrations
in
places
all
over
atlanta
city
in
demonstrations.
this
court
in
hamm
versus
rock
hill,
of
course,
held
that
a
person
cannot
be
punished
or
prosecuted
for
peaceable,
non-forcible
exercise
of
the
rights
granted
them
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
with
respect
to
public
accommodations.
but
that
does
not
include
all
conduct
which
might
take
place
in
those
places.
another
thing
which
we
--
i
particularly
want
to
call
to
this
court's
attention
is
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
has
followed
the
hamm
versus
rock
hill
decision
of
this
honorable
court
in
a
unanimous
decision
by
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
bolton
versus
the
state
of
georgia.
the
georgia
supreme
court
discussed
the
decision
of
this
court
in
hamm
versus
rock
hill
and
abated
a
series
of
trespass
convictions
which
arose
from
a
sit-in
or
a
demonstration
in
an
athens
georgia
restaurant.
judge
bell
said,
the
dissenting
judge
of
the
fifth
circuit
panel,
"that
the
georgia
court
should
have
a
chance
to
pass
upon
these
cases
in
light
of
the
fact
of
the
decision
in
the
bolton
case.
the
fact
that
they
held
--
recognized
in
authoring
the
decisions
of
this
court."
i
might
add
parenthetically
your
honors
that
up
until
three
years
ago,
i
was
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
the
northern
district
of
georgia,
back,
i
was
the
first
assistant
for
several
years
and
i've
been
on
both
sides
of
this
removal
question.
i've
on
occasion
had
to
remove
cases
from
state
to
federal
court
under
section
1442
where
federal
officers
were
charged
for
offenses
committed
in
the
performance
or
in
the
color
of
their
office.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
is
a
radical
departure
from
all
of
the
decisions
of
this
honorable
court
on
the
question
of
removal
and
i'm
talking
about
removal
and
not
for
the
defendant's
or
the
respondents
would
be
convicted
if
they
were
tried
in
the
state
court
but
simply
on
the
basic
question
of
whether
or
not
a
person
can
allege
that
in
a
pure
conclusion
as
they
did
in
the
rachel
petition.
if
the
court
--
i'm
certain
the
court
will
read
the
rachel
petition,
you
will
see
that
it
is
nothing
but
conclusions.
they
alleged
only
the
facts
that
20
people
were
arrested
in
this
place,
this
place,
and
this
place
and
so
they
were
arrested
while
attempting
to
exercise
their
right
to
seek
food,
comfort,
and
the
entertainment
at
these
public
restaurants.
now
at
the
time
this
petition
was
filed,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
had
not
been
enacted
in
the
law.
then
they
--
well,
then
they
alleged
in
one
sentence
that
the
state
of
georgia
by
statute
custom,
usage
and
practice,
supports
and
maintains
a
policy
of
racial
discrimination.
then
they
alleged
that
they
cannot
enforce
that
they
are
denied
their
rights
and
cannot
enforce
their
rights
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
georgia
before
any
action
is
taken
against
any
of
these
persons
before
trial.
they
do
not
allege
a
single
discriminatory
act
by
a
judge.
they
do
not
dis
--
allege
any
oppressive
act
by
any
prosecuting
attorney.
they
simply
said,
"because
we
were
arrested,
we
conclude
that
georgia
practices
such
a
policy
of
racial
discrimination."
they
do
not
even
allege
that
the
statute,
the
trespass
statute
under
which
they're
being
prosecuted
as
either
unconstitutional
or
being
unconstitutionally
applied
as
to
them.
district
judge
boyd
sloan
who
has
recently
retired
from
the
bench
but
who
has
been
both
the
state
and
federal
court
judge
for
about
40
years.
he
promptly
remanded
the
next
day
after
it
was
filed.
he
remanded
all
the
cases
stating
and
relying
upon
all
of
these
prior
decisions
of
the
appellate
courts
and
of
this
honorable
court,
the
rives-powers
line
of
cases
that
it
did
not
set
out
grounds
for
removal.
now
the
respondents
in
this
case,
i
believe
mr.
amsterdam
wrote
the
brief,
i'm
so
informed
and
incidentally
it
was
a
very
excellent
brief.
it
--
he's
obviously
spent
years
studying
this
situation.
it
goes
back
into
history,
congressional
history
and
so
forth,
but
mr.
amsterdam,
if
he
wrote
the
brief
and
i
understand
that
he
did,
he
claims
that
this
court
can
uphold
the
fifth
circuit
ruling
in
the
rachel
case
without
disturbing
the
rives-powers
line
of
decisions.
and
he
says,
that
is
so
for
this
reason.
he
says
that
the
rives-powers
line
of
cases
are
a
procedural
matter
that
they
protect
a
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
against
a
procedural
matter.
that
is
the
right
to
have
members
of
your
own
race
empanel
on
the
traverse
jury
which
is
to
try
you,
and
that
this
case
is
in
the
rachel
case,
the
right
that
the
petitioners
are
seeking
or
the
respondents
are
seeking
to
preserve
by
removing
the
federal
court
is
a
right
against
prosecution.
and
he
says
that
that
is
a
substantive
right
whereas
the
rives-powers'
line
of
cases
are
a
procedural
right
only
and
therefore,
there's
a
distinction
that
this
court
can
distinguish
rives-power
line
of
authority
from
this
case.
but
i
wish
to
call
the
court's
attention
that
that
isn't
what
the
court
said
--
what
this
honorable
court
said
in
1880.
in
strauder
versus
west
virginia,
the
first
of
the
cases
that
three
--
at
page
309,
the
court
asked
this
rhetorical
question
and
this
was
a
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
is
not
protection
against
a
race
or
a
color
prejudice
in
empanelling
a
jury
a
right,
a
legal
right
under
the
constitutional
amendment.
and
then
they
answered
it
--
that
was
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
course
and
they
answered
it
by
saying,
"if
the
statutes
of
west
virginia
discriminating
as
they
do
in
the
selection
of
jurors
amounts
to
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
to
a
colored
man
when
he
is
put
on
trial
on
alleged
defense
against
a
state."
and
i
submit
that
that
is
a
substantive
right.
i
submit
that
respondents
has
pleading
when
they
say
the
difference
between
removing
a
case
to
the
federal
court
because
you
can't
have
a
person
of
your
own
color
on
the
jury
which
tries
you
in
removing
a
case
because
you
cannot
be
prosecuted
if
you're
within
the
holding
of
hamm
versus
rock
hill.
they
are
both
substantive
rights.
either
one
is
procedural.
one
is
procedural
in
effect
it
--
prosecution
is
going
forward
in
the
rachel
case,
prosecution
was
going
forward
and
it
was
a
question
of
state
procedure
there.
again,
mr.
amsterdam
or
the
respondents
say
on
page
95
of
their
brief
and
this
is
the
essence
of
the
case
as
i
see
it.
they
said
that
defendants
prosecuted
for
the
exercise
of
the
right,
the
equal
public
accommodations
granted
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
may
remove
the
prosecutions
to
a
federal
district
court
whether
the
statute
under
which
they
are
charged
violates
those
rights
on
its
face
or
as
applied.
in
other
words,
the
respondents
are
saying
if
they
have
an
absolute
right
to
remove
the
case
regardless
of
whether
the
statute
is
being
constitutionally
applied
or
is
constitutional
on
its
face.
in
fact,
in
the
brief,
the
respondents,
they
argue
that
persons
prosecuted
in
the
exercise
of
the
rights
granted
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
are
insulated
from
the
prosecuted
process.
and
i
don't
believe
that
mr.
amsterdam
will
quarrel
with
those
words.
he
uses
the
term
insulation
several
times
that
they
simply
cannot
be
prosecuted
and
i
res
--
most
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
if
the
court
should
abduct
the
respondent's
theory
in
this
respect,
it
would
create
a
virtual
no
man's
land
in
law
enforcement
in
cases
arising
or
possibly
arising
in
the
future
out
of
this
act.
mr.
amsterdam
apparently
contends
for
the
respondents
that
if
a
person
is
arrested
in
a
place
of
public
accommodation
that
before
he
gets
to
the
jailhouse
he
can
--
his
lawyers
can
file
a
removal
petition
and
he
will
be
brought
into
federal
court.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
because
he
says
that
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
taken
into
conjunction
with
hamm
versus
rock
hill
insulates
them
against
prosecution
at
all.
and
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
that
would
leave
the
states
and
the
federal
law
enforcement
officials
in
acquiring
the
risk
as
to
how
to
proceed.
if
i
might
pose
a
hypothetical
question,
hypothetical
situation,
suppose
that
a
number
of
demonstrators
seeking
to
exercise
their
right
to
eat
in
a
restaurant
or
formally
integrated
restaurant
and
incidentally,
there
are
very
few
of
those
in
the
south
anymore,
atlanta,
georgia
is
completely
integrated,
as
integrated
as
washington
d.c.
but
if
they
went
in
and
some
persons
on
the
inside
did
not
agree
with
them,
started
a
--
an
argument
and
suppose
that
both
side
started
fighting
and
rioting
on
the
inside.
suppose
that
the
demonstrators
themselves
were
fighting,
who
would
move
then
to
control
that
if
this
court
says
that
the
demonstrators
are
insulated
from
prosecution,
from
state
prosecution.
certainly,
the
federal
could
not
move
in
because
federal
law
enforcement
officers
cannot
move
in
unless
they
authorize
by
specific
statute
to
--
and
given
criminal
jurisdictions
as
the
fbi
and
the
internal
revenue
or
the
state
official
certainly
would
be
ought
to
move
in
because
they
would
have
the
idea
that
if
they
are
making
a
case
to
be
carried
to
the
federal
court.
i
most
honestly
submit
to
the
court
that
this
isn't
a
matter
of
grave
importance
to
the
whole
country
at
large.
i
have
mentioned
to
say
that
thousands
of
cases
are
of
state
court
prosecutions
will
rest
on
what
this
court
says,
a
103
in
georgia
alone
are
pending.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
no,
sir.
i
do
not
know
what
the
total
figure
is
but
i
know
that
there
are
number
of
district
courts
(inaudible)
are
reserving
rulings
that
--
i
know
that
there
are
number
pending
in
greenwood
versus
peacock
which
is
following
me
in
argument.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
your
honor,
mississippi
and
georgia
is
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
the
--
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
--
that's
the
difference
between
peacock
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
and
rachel.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
that's
the
federal
law
which
is
involved.
the
difference
between
rachel
and
peacock
and
i'm
not
trying
to
undermine
my
sister
state
of
mississippi
because
they've
helped
me
and
i've
helped
them
in
the
briefing
on
this
case
but
rachel
stands
on
a
different
footing
from
peacock
in
these
respects,
answering
justice
white's
question.
in
the
rachel
case,
the
petition
is
grossly
inadequate
for
removal.
the
petition
in
peacock
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
alleges
that
the
mississippi
(inaudible)
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
not
very
many
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
not
very
many,
your
honor,
in
the
largest
cities
such
as
atlanta
and
birmingham,
i
assume
places
like
that
but
throughout
the
south
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
there
are
many
smaller
places
in
which
prosecution
might
be
commenced.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes.
there's
some
are
pending.
i
think
most
of
them
are
--
they
are
pending
in
the
district
courts
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
they've
been
--
they've
been
removed
to
the
district
court.
your
honor,
some
of
them
undoubtedly
will
be
dismissed
whether
they
go
back
to
the
state
court
or
whether
they
stay
in
the
federal
court.
some
however
go
beyond
the
holding
in
hamm
and
lupper.
some
involved
violence
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
on
the
part
of
the
demonstrators'
acts
of
vandalism
in
the
place
--
in
restaurants
which
i
do
not
believe
this
court
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
insulated
in
hamm
and
lupper.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
it
could,
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
argument
over
the
scope
and
that
is
one
of
the
points
which
we
specifically
make
in
our
brief
that
in
the
event
we
don't
prevail
at
all
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
that
the
district
court
at
least
should
be
allowed
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
cases
fall
within
hamm
(inaudible)
--
hamm
and
lupper.
if
so,
they
are
protected,
its
protected
conduct
but
if
they
are
outside
the
peaceable
non-violence
scope
of
hamm
and
lupper
then
they
should
be
remanded
to
the
state
court
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
and
that's
what
the
district
--
circuit
court
bell
said.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
i
feel
that
the
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
i
think
so
because
otherwise
you
will
have
your
federal
district
courts
trying
municipal
court
cases,
disorderly
conduct
and
things
like
that.
the
federal
district
courts
are
flooded
with
the
(inaudible).
and
i've
--
i'm
just
expressing
an
opinion
but
i
don't
think
the
federal
district
courts
want
those
cases
because
uniformly,
they
remand
them
when
the
state
ask
for
them
to
be
remanded.
of
course,
i
know
that
the
district
courts
will
entertain
them
if
they're
directed
to
or
if
this
court
decides
that
they
should.
this
contention
of
the
appellants
virtually
amounts
to
creating
an
original
trial
of
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court.
it's
like
asking
this
court
by
judicial
decree
to
--
decree
a
new
type
of
federal
jurisdiction
that
federal
district
courts
will
entertain
all
cases
arising
under
the
civil
rights
act
commenced
by
state
prosecution.
and
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that
does
not
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
didn't
hear
the
first
part
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
of
the
question
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
they
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir,
they
would
--
in
georgia
it's
called
the
plea
and
abatement.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
would
say
that
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
would
certainly
dismiss
under
bolton
against
the
state
of
georgia.
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
held
it.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
you
would
not
have
a
trial.
you
would
merely
have
a
hearing.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
if
they
--
if
they
went
beyond
the
scope
of
hamm
versus
lupper
then
there
would
be
a
jury
trial
of
questions
as
to
whether
they
violated
or
trial
before
the
court
without
a
jury
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
sir?
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
you
would
have
a
trial
then.
my
light
is
flashed.
i
want
to
call
attention
to
the
court
to
one
other
thing
if
i
might
take
just
one
minute.
and
that
is
that
the
construction
that
is
sought
by
this
court
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
it
wasn't?
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir,
that
was
my
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
haven't
figured
out
these
lights
yet.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
saw
the
red
one
flashed
just
then
and
i
thought
my
time
was
up
but
i
just
had
one
other
thing
to
say
your
honors.
the
action
which
i
--
the
respondents
are
asking
this
court
to
take
today
is
one
that
they
tried
to
get
enacted
in
the
law
in
1964,
when
the
1964
civil
rights
act
was
passed.
house
resolution
--
h.r.
7702
was
introduced
by
mr.
kastenmeier
and
it
is
sought
to
amend
section
1443
using
these
words,
“the
right
of
removal
under
this
section
shall
be
freely
sustained
and
this
section
shall
be
construed
to
apply
to
any
state
action,
executive,
legislative
or
administrative,
or
otherwise
having
the
effect
of
denial
or
infringement
of
equal
rights
and
congress
did
not
so
amend
the
statute,
and
that
is
what
in
effect
the
respondent's
are
asking
this
court
to
do
judicially
when
congress
did
not
do
it
--
did
not
pass
the
act
in
that
form.”
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
no,
sir,
it
is
not.
i
did
not
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
know
about
it
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
it
is
house
resolution
7702.
my
colleagues
from
mississippi
told
me
about
it
yesterday
when
i
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
it's
in
the
peacock
reply
brief.
i
understand
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
the
district
court
proceeded
on
the
grounds
that
the
--
if
the
removal
petition
itself
does
not
set
out
grounds
that
it
should
be
remanded
and
that
has
been
the
practice
in
many
of
the
--
well,
in
practically
all
of
the
federal
courts.
it
has
not
been
the
practice
for
the
courts
to
--
for
the
district
courts
to
hold
hearings
if
they
read
the
removal
petition
like
a
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
pleading
i
mean.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
alright,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
the
district
court
just
says
that
the
respondents
have
not
shown
--
did
not
allege
that
any
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
they
have
not
pointed
to
any
statute
in
anyway
abridges
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
they
did
not
go
beyond
that.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
if
you
--
if
the
court
should
hold
that,
i
think
that
would
be
--
your
honor
is
right.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
no,
sir.
the
district
court
has
not
passed
on
that
and
under
the
present
ruling
of
the
fifth
circuit
he
can't
pass
on
anything
except
whether
or
not
race
was
involved
in
the
removal
of
the
persons
from
the
places
of
public
accommodation.
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
guidance
is
badly
needed
and
i'm
certain,
the
court
will
give
guidance
in
this
field
but
state
authorities
don't
know
what
to
do
and
the
federal
district
courts
don't
know
what
to
do.
this
is
a
relatively
new
problem
although
age
old
but,
i
mean,
in
its
present
facet.
now,
we
respectfully
submit
that
georgia
can
handle
these
cases
fairly
or
we
have
--
our
supreme
court
has
followed
hamm
and
lupper.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
and
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
your
honor,
i
can't
answer
that
categorically
because
i
said,
this
covers
about
20
cases
and
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
evidence
in
all
of
the
cases
but
i
can
say
this,
in
some
instances,
i
think
that
the
conduct
would
be
covered
by
hamm
versus
lupper,
i
mean,
it
would
be
insulated.
some
demonstrations
were
peaceful.
others
involved
pushing,
shoving,
kicking
by
the
demonstrators.
they
tried
to
force
their
way
in
to
one
restaurant,
formed
a
flying
wedge
and
rushed
the
door,
kicked
the
proprietor
on
his
leg
and
so
forth.
that
type,
i
do
not
believe
would
be
covered
by
hamm
versus
lupper.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
well,
your
honor
there
was
a
--
there
a
hundred
and
one
of
them
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
there
were
a
hundred
and
one
of
them
indicted
and
before
only
two
of
them
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
only
two
got
tried
and
then
the
whole
batch
was
removed
over
the
federal
court
and
we've
been
fighting
the
question
of
removability
ever
since.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir,
that's
true.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
well,
your
honor,
they've
--
the
district
court
hadn't
had
jurisdiction
of
this
case
so
that
they
can
be
dismissed
from
that
time.
it's
been
on
appeal
ever
since.
it
was
on
appeal
when
hamm
and
lupper
came
down
so
--
i
mean
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
no,
sir.
i
mean,
the
federal
district
court
has
not
had
jurisdiction
of
these
cases.
are
they
--
they've
been
on
appeal
ever
since.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
no,
sir.
going
up
through
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
they
were
pending
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
no,
sir.
they
haven't
had
them
--
they
haven't
had
them
before
them
because
they've
been
on
appeal
all
this
time.
they
remit
it
to
or
the
mandate
has
never
gone
back
from
the
fifth
circuit
pending
the
appeal
to
be
certiorari
to
this
court.
so,
no
one
has
jurisdiction
of
them
now
except
this
honorable
court.
as
a
manner
of
speaking
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes.
i
don't
think
you
can
miss
--
dismiss
a
case,
its
own
appeal
because
until
the
mandate
is
returned,
the
cases
are
not
--
the
district
court
has
no
power
to
enter
on
all
of
them.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
but
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
i
don't
know
your
honor.
we
are
saying
that
what
--
our
position
is
if
we
want
to
get
them
back
in
a
state
court
and
let
us
dispose
of
them
in
the
state
court.
we
feel
that
they
were
improperly
removed
and
when
we
get
them
back
we'll
dispose
of
them
justly.
those
that
need
to
be
dismissed,
we
will
dismiss
them
in
a
state
court,
and
those
which
may
need
to
be
tried,
we'll
try
them
in
the
state
court
--
in
a
state
court.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
this
is
purely
a
question
of
jurisdiction
that
we
are
arguing
right
now
and
not
the
merits
of
the
case,
i
couldn't
tell
you
what
the
merits
of
any
particular
case
was.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
and
to
the
extent
if
they
should
be
prosecuted,
they
will
be
prosecuted.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
that's
in
our
position.
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
yes,
sir.
they're
all
in
the
courts
but
then
--
but
none
of
them
are
in
the
state
courts.
they're
all
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
j.
robert
sparks
--
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
and
as
i
say,
it's
been
on
appeal
continuously
for
about
18
months.
and
even
the
district
court
--
district
court
does
have
jurisdiction
of
the
two
which
were
just
removed
last
week.
my
time
is
up
and
i
appreciate
the
courtesy
of
the
court.
