mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
of
the
several
grounds
which
georgia
urges
for
reversal
here,
one,
the
construction
of
a
civil
rights
removal
statute
is
of
overwhelming
importance.
mr.
sparks
has
just
said
eloquently
i
think
that
state
prosecutors
in
the
federal
district
courts
need
guidance
in
this
matter.
and
the
question
is
involved
not
only
in
this
case
and
in
the
peacock
case
which
follows
but
in
others
pending
here
and
many
pending
in
the
lower
courts.
i
perhaps
should
say
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
to
mr.
mcpherson
yesterday
that
the
issues
in
this
case,
rachel,
are
not
exactly
the
same
as
those
in
peacock
and
that
it
might
well
be
that
peacock
might
be
decided
in
favor
of
a
remanded
state
court,
although,
jurisdiction
in
the
rachel
case
would
be
sustained.
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
decide
the
cases
the
other
way
around
but
the
issues
are
not
exactly
the
same.
because
of
the
importance
of
the
issues,
because
congress
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
deemed
their
resolution
by
this
court
essential
to
the
effective
protection
of
federal
civil
rights
by
the
federal
courts.
i
would
like
to
argue
that
question,
the
question
of
construction
of
section
1443
of
the
judicial
code.
first,
notwithstanding
the
slight
branch
in
strict
logic
that's
involved
in
putting
off
until
later
the
question
raised
by
mr.
mcpherson
as
to
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
substantive
contention
on
the
merits.
now
on
the
issue
of
statutory
construction,
the
text
which
we
must
construe
is
set
out
at
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
and
i
mean
to
refer
to
it
at
this
time
not
to
argue
the
case
under
the
language
of
the
statute
but
merely
to
outline
and
i
thought
that
it
might
be
helpful
to
the
court,
the
various
possible
constructions
of
the
statute
and
the
contentions
made
not
only
by
the
parties
here
but
also
by
various
lower
courts
that
have
passed
on
the
questions.
i
do
this
because
as
i
shall
say
in
a
minute,
i
don't
think
that
the
question
in
this
case
is
one
that
can
be
decided
as
a
matter
of
language.
i
do
not
think
that
syllogistic
work
with
words.
i
do
not
think
that
punctuation.
i
do
not
think
that
grammar
is
the
answer
to
this
case.
i
think
its
answer
is
in
history
and
i
think
its
answer
is
in
the
practical
functioning
of
the
civil
rights
jurisdiction
in
this
country
today.
questions
i
shall
come
to
very
shortly
in
this
argument.
now,
looking
at
the
language
of
the
statute
for
the
moment
just
for
the
purpose
of
outlining
the
possible
constructions
of
it,
i
turn
first
to
section
1443
(2)
because,
although,
the
fifth
circuit
below
decided
this
case
on
section
1443
(1)
as
i
shall
make
clear
i
hope
a
little
later
in
the
argument,
i
myself
would
prefer
to
see
the
court
rest
affirmance
of
the
decision
below
which
you
can
do
on
section
1443
(2).
and
also
because
mr.
sparks
has
argued
implications
for
this
case
from
the
rives-powers
line
of
decisions
and
those
decisions
or
constructions
only
of
section
1443
(1)
leaving
the
court
entirely
free
i
believe
to
construe
for
the
first
time
in
this
case
and
the
peacock
case
following
section
1443
(2).
now,
1443
(2)
allows
removal
where
a
prosecution
is
for
any
act
under
color
of
authority
derived
from
any
law
providing
for
equal
rights.
there
is
also
a
refusing
clause
in
section
1443
(2)
which
we
do
not
rely
on
in
this
court
which
i
believe
the
petitioners
in
peacock
removed
--
petitioners
in
peacock
do
rely
on,
we
do
not.
we
construe
the
phrase,
“any
act
under
color
of
authority
derived
from
the
law
providing
for
equal
rights,”
to
mean,
any
act
which
is
authorized
by
a
federal
law
protecting
civil
rights
which
is
permitted
by
a
federal
law
providing
for
equal
rights
which
is
protected
by
a
federal
law
providing
for
equal
rights.
we
read
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
do
not
need
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case
because
the
rights
which
we
claim
in
this
case
are
protected
expressly
by
sections
201
and
203
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
which
georgia
has
not
contended,
it's
not
a
law
providing
for
equal
rights
which
i
think
no
law
or
federal
court
has
began
to
suggest
is
not
and
which
i
think
clearly
is.
so,
we
need
not
reach
the
constitutional
question
in
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
removal
petition
was
filed
in
this
case
and
the
case
remanded
before
the
civil
rights
act
was
passed.
i
don't
think
that
that
affects
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
not
at
all.
hamm
and
lupper
have
resolved
the
question
i
take
it
as
to
whether
or
not
the
substantive
protection
of
the
act
applies
in
such
cases.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
federal
jurisdiction
is
proper
in
such
cases
is
a
question
whether
a
statute
governing
the
jurisdiction
of
courts
should
apply
to
pending
cases.
now
traditionally,
a
procedural
removal
statute
is
applied
to
pending
cases.
i
see
no
reason
why
if
a
substantive
provision
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
do
not
begin
to
operate
as
of
july
2nd,
1964
but
relayed
back,
i
see
no
reason
why
we
would
remove
under
the
statutes
dating
from
1866
should
not
have
the
benefit
of
that.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
question
i
think
is
only
whether
or
not
we
should
have
alleged
with
greater
particularity
when
we
did
the
rights
which
we
now
seek
to
assert
because
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
exactly
our
position.we
think
that
as
far
as
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
absolutely
your
honor,
that
--
that
of
course,
at
that
point,
the
question
was
before
this
court
which
the
court
has
never
resolved
as
to
the
constitutional
protection
of
the
conduct
which
we
claim
now
as
protected
under
the
civil
rights
act.
and
it
was
under
the
constitution
that
we
originally
sought
to
remove
but
unless
this
court
should
find
that
because
our
pleadings
are
insufficient
or
for
some
other
reason,
hamm
and
lupper
does
not
reach
and
protect
this
case.
there
need
be
reach
no
constitutional
question
in
this
case
nor
any
question
as
to
whether
section
1443
and
its
phrase
“law
providing
for
equal
rights”
means
anything
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
now,
the
state
of
georgia
has
taken
the
position
that
an
act
under
color
of
authority
means
an
act
under
color
of
office.
and
it
is
when
that
in
effect
that
the
federal
officers
and
the
persons
acting
under
them.
and
this
is
a
position
which
has
since
been
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
peacock
case
although
in
rogers
in
tuscaloosa
and
other
panel
of
the
fifth
circuit
regarded
the
question
it's
still
open
there.
the
third
possible
construction
of
section
1443
(2)
which
should
command
the
consideration
of
the
court
is
that
by
judge
friendly
in
the
galamison
case
in
the
second
circuit.
judge
friendly
without
resolving
the
question
whether
the
phrase
color
of
authority
meant
color
of
office
and
whether
the
statute
does
reach
anybody
other
than
officers
and
persons
acting
under
them
said
that
authority
derived
from
the
federal
law,
only
a
federal
law
directed
a
specific
act
to
be
done.
an
act
was
authorized
by
under
color
of
authority
of
law
if
it
was
a
direction
given
by
that
law
to
do
the
act.
we
think
that
doesn't
amount
to
very
much
other
than
the
construction
that
the
statute
is
limited
to
officers
and
persons
acting
under
them
because
no
civil
rights
law
that
we
know
of
directs
anybody
to
do
anything
other
than
federal
officers
and
persons
acting
under
them.
so
i
think
that
the
alternatives
meaningfully
in
construction
of
1443
(2)
are
simply,
whether
or
not
under
color
of
authority
means
protected
by
federal
law
and
does
reaches
demonstrators,
sit-ins,
and
persons
who
are
protected
by
federal
law
which
precludes
their
prosecution
or
whether
it
is
limited
to
federal
officers.
and
again
for
the
moment
without
arguing,
we're
just
simply
pointing
out
what
the
alternatives
mean
at
this
point.
i
would
point
out
that
that
second
construction
reached
1443
(2)
off
the
books
because
section
1442
(a)
of
the
judicial
code
today
allows
removal
on
all
federal
office
in
cases
of
civil
rights
or
otherwise
including
persons
acting
under
federal
office.
now
passing
the
1443
(1)
again
merely
with
the
purpose
of
outlining
what
the
issues
are
and
what
the
possible
constructions
are,
1443
(1)
unlike
1443
(2)
asks
a
question
not
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
was
for
the
first
time
broadened
to
include
all
federal
officers
in
the
1948
judicial
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
revenue
officers
only.
the
first
section
of
1443
asks
questions
that
the
second
section
does
not.
it
allows
for
a
removal
only
in
the
case
of
prosecutions
or
civil
cases
against
the
person
who
is
denied
or
cannot
enforce
in
the
state
courts
a
--
an
equal
civil
right
or
right
provided
--
protected
by
a
law,
a
right
under
a
law
providing
for
equal
civil
rights.
now,
the
various
possible
constructions
of
1443
(1)
i
think
are
broader
than
those
of
the
1443
(2).
first
of
all,
there
is
the
construction
of
the
rives-powers
line
of
cases
argued
by
mr.
sparks
this
morning
that
the
denial
spoken
off
by
section
1443
(1)
is
a
denial
which
arises
from
the
face
of
a
state
statute
or
constitution,
unconstitutional
on
its
face
that
where
that
existed
is
both
the
necessary
and
sufficient
condition
of
removal
that
no
question
can
be
asked
whether
the
state
courts
will
uphold
the
state
statute
albeit
unconstitutional
or
will
strike
it
down
and
that
the
one
hallmark
of
removability
is
an
unconstitutional
state
statute.
a
second
possible
interpretation
is
that
when
a
removal
petition
is
filed
as
it
now
must
be
filed
in
advance
of
trial,
the
federal
court
shall
try
case
by
case,
issue
by
issue
the
question
whether
the
removal
petitioner
is
being
denied
or
has
been
denied
and
cannot
enforce
in
the
state
courts
a
right
under
the
constitution
and
laws.
now
for
the
moment,
i'm
treating
the
words
denied
and
cannot
enforce
as
though
they
were
tautologic.
and
i'll
come
to
a
moment
--
in
a
moment
to
the
government's
position
in
peacock
that
they
are
not.
a
position
which
we
don't
have
to
reach
in
our
case
because
we
think
that
the
result
is
the
same,
however
when
used,
those
two
words.
but
any
possibility
in
construing
section
1443
(1)
would
be
to
say
that
the
federal
district
court
on
a
removal
petition
would
try
whether
or
not
a
petitioner
who
is
charged
with
sitting
in,
in
a
--
or
seeking
service
in
a
restaurant
covered
by
the
public
accommodations
title
could
have
his
right
to
the
defense
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
fairly
tried
in
the
state
court.
and
as
i
understand
that
that
is
mr.
sparks
alternative
contention
that
we
look
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
although
why
only
to
that
court,
i'm
not
sure.
why
not
to
judge
price
court
which
this
case
would
be
tried
in
the
first
instance.
however,
we
look
to
the
georgia
court
and
we
try
their
fidelity
to
the
constitution.
will
they
or
will
they
not
obey
the
constitution?
will
they
or
will
they
not
follow
this
court's
decision?
now,
a
third
possible
construction
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
under
this
construction
of
the
statute,
you
would
have
to
try
the
probability
that
the
state
court
would
come
to
an
unconstitutional
result.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
do
that.
i
am
simply
outlining
the
possible
constructions
but
i
haven't
yet
come
to
the
one
we're
urging.
the
third
possible
construction
splits
the
word
denied
and
cannot
enforce
into
two
pieces
and
it
says
that
section
1443
(1)
has
two
rights
to
remove.
a
right
to
remove
where
one
is
denied
a
federal
civil
right
and
a
right
to
remove
or
one
cannot
enforce
a
civil
right
and
it
says
that
wherever
the
conduct
or
which
the
prosecution
is
brought
is
itself
protected
by
a
federal
substantive
guarantee
which
allows
that
conduct
that
the
very
fact
of
the
arrest
in
the
commencement
of
the
prosecution
is
a
denial
of
their
right
and
that
without
reaching
any
question,
it
cannot
enforce
the
prosecution
as
(inaudible)
it's
a
removal.
this,
i
understand
to
be
the
government's
position
in
the
peacock
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
judge
sobeloff
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--
in
the
dissent
in
the
danville
case
did,
i
think
graphically
illustrates
by
punctuation
exactly
how
this
would
work.
i
myself
don't
ask
the
court
to
take
that
position
and
i
don't
because
in
my
judgment,
the
only
justification
for
a
removal
jurisdiction
at
all
is
some
feeling
that
the
state
courts
cannot,
will
not,
do
not
enforce
certain
kinds
of
federal
rights
and
therefore
i
hesitate
to
focus
attention
on
the
arrest
process.
i'm
much
more
concerned
with
the
process
in
the
trial
court.
i
think
i
shall
explain
why
i
think
that
notwithstanding
that,
our
cases
within
the
denial
and
cannot
enforce
language.
now
the
fourth
possible
construction
is
that
which
we
urge
in
this
case
that
because
of
the
inevitable
pendency
and
in
speaking
of
this,
i
do
not
speak
of
the
southern
state
courts
alone.
i
do
not
speak
of
the
courts
in
fulton
county
alone.
i
speak
of
the
natural
effect
of
appending
criminal
prosecution
on
the
kind
of
conduct
which
the
prosecution
has
brought
upon
it
because
of
the
general
deterrent
effect
of
a
prosecution
on
conduct.
we
claim
that
the
very
pendency
of
a
prosecution
in
a
state
court
against
a
person
for
a
federally
protected
right
is
in
itself
a
denial
of
that
right
and
denial
of
the
ability
to
enforce
that
right,
were
to
put
it
exactly
in
mr.
sparks'
language,
we
do
indeed
claim
in
this
case
that
with
respect
to
certain
federal
rights.
those
few
precious
federal
rights
that
congress
has
either
hedged
about
as
it
did
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
with
a
special
guarantee
that
no
one
should
be
coerced,
intimidated,
harassed
or
punished
for
seeking
to
assert
this
right
and
with
some
other
rights
we
need
not
be
reached
in
this
case.
the
first
amendment
rights
involved
in
peacock,
that
the
very
precious
nature
of
those
rights
and
the
suppressive
effect
on
a
prosecution
which
this
court
has
recognized
in
many
cases
over
the
years
is
a
justification
for
a
jurisdiction
which
does
indeed
insulate
from
prosecution
persons
who
engage
in
that
conduct.
now
notice,
when
i
say
insulation
from
prosecution,
all
that
means
is
that
the
question
whether
or
not
the
prosecution
shall
go
on
is
to
be
tried
in
a
federal
court
in
the
first
instance
and
not
in
a
state
court.
and
in
reaching
the
questions
of
construction
which
i've
now
laid
out
in
explaining
why
i
reached
that
result,
i
want
to
pass
if
i
may
from
the
language
to
history
and
then
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
cert
--
mr.
anthony

the
pendency
of
the
case
in
the
state
--
in
the
federal
court
does
have
some
effect.
let
me
answer
that
question
in
several
different
ways.
first
of
all,
the
length
of
pendency
is
absolutely
critical.
if
we
compare,
for
example,
the
mississippi
freedom
writer
cases,
the
freedom
rights
were
in
may
of
1961,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
in
a
case
that
was
clearly
controlled
by
this
court's
prior
decision
affirmed
in
1965
(voice

--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
right
and
when
you
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
thought
that
i
--
when
you
asked
whether
or
not
the
pendency
of
the
case
in
the
federal
court
was
not
repressive
in
the
same
way
that
it
was
in
a
state
court,
my
answer
is
as
a
matter
of
degree,
it
is
critically
different.
it
is
differently
repressive.
it
is
less
repressive
because
the
probability
that
a
federal
district
judge
would
have
allowed
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
the
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
if
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
whole
argument
does
indeed
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--
depend
on
that
but
let
me
distinguish
between
two
ways
in
which
that
issue
is
critical.
one
is,
if
case
by
case,
the
federal
court
had
to
decide
the
probabilities
in
a
state
court
and
the
other
is
the
question
whether
congress
has
not
made
the
generic
judgment
about
state
courts
in
these
cases
which
has
ordered
a
federal
court
because
of
the
increase
probability
of
repression
in
the
state
courts
generically
to
take
these
cases
without
inquiring
case
by
case,
instance
by
instance,
whether
or
not
the
state
courts
will
probably
enforce
the
federal
right.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
do
completely
agree.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
we
can
--
we
are
perfectly
agreeable
to
that.
we
believe
that
a
federal
district
court
if
a
petition
for
removal
is
contested
on
the
facts,
must
try
the
issues
alleged
in
the
petition
and
denied
any
answer.
but
if
a
petitioner
filed
under
1442
(a)
by
a
federal
officer,
asserting
i
am
a
federal
officer
and
the
answer
was,
“you're
not
a
federal
officer,
you're
a
law
professor”,
i
would
expect
that
the
federal
district
court
would
try
that
issue.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
there's
no
question
that
if
the
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
in
this
case?
oh,
then
what
happens
in
the
federal
court?
a
hearing
has
to
be
held
on
the
specific
question
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh
no.
no
jury
trial.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
question
is
a
jurisdictional
one.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
because
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
court
shall
accept
jurisdiction
over
the
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
let
me
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
even
if
this
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
differ
from
the
government.
we
take
a
somewhat
narrower
view
of
the
right
of
removal
and
therefore
we
end
up
with
a
somewhat
different
view
on
what
happens
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
exactly
and
let
me
explain
why
that's
so.
if
this
case
were
tried
in
the
state
court,
i
believe
that
the
state
judge
not
the
jury
would
have
to
decide
the
hamm
and
lupper
issue.
mr.
justice
clark
asked
whether
or
not
--
that
would
be
tried
on
an
issue
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
believe
that
if
a
motion
to
abate
were
filed
citing
hamm
and
lupper
in
a
state
court
that
for
the
same
reason
that
under
jackson
and
denno,
a
state
judge
is
required
to
try
the
federal
constitutional
issue
of
a
confession
at
the
federal
--
that
a
state
trial
judge
would
be
required
to
try
without
a
jury
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
facts
brought
this
case
within
hamm
and
lupper.
i
think
that
then
a
jury
trial
would
have
to
be
held
on
whether
or
not
a
state
statute
had
been
violated
and
i
point
out
that
in
the
event
that
this
case
came
to
conviction
in
a
state
court
and
was
affirmed
on
appeal
that
when
a
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
was
filed
after
state
trial,
a
federal
district
judge
sitting
without
jury
would
decide
all
over
again
if
the
case
had
not
been
removed
and
advanced
at
trial
whether
or
not
the
petitioner's
conduct
fell
within
the
state
statute
and
whether
or
not
it
fall
within
the
protection
of
hamm
and
lupper.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
let
me
--
mr.
justice
white,
if
i
may,
this
issue
seems
to
me
critical,
i
mean,
the
entire
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--
construction
of
the
removal
statute.
the
question
of
--
as
soon
as
mr.
sparks
put
the
scope
of
hamm
and
lupper,
is
a
question
of
the
existence
of
hamm
and
lupper
because
--
let
me
explain
why.
we
think
congress
made
the
judgment
that
these
cases
should
be
tried
to
a
federal
judge
in
a
federal
court
at
the
outset.
if
this
case
is
now
decided
against
removal,
let
me
hypothesis
for
a
moment
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
(inaudible)
--
the
respondents
in
this
court
remove
a
petitioner
in
this
case,
thomas
rachel
comes
to
me
and
says
to
me,
“i'd
like
to
sit-in
in
one
of
the
few
remaining
segregated
restaurants
in
atlanta
or
the
many
remaining
segregated
restaurants
outside
atlanta,
can
i
do
it?”
what
would
i
have
to
tell
him?
i
would
have
to
tell
him,
“of
course
you
can
do
it."
if
the
restaurant
is
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
congress
has
said
in
so
many
words,
"you
have
a
right
of
equal
access
in
the
restaurant.”
and
congress
has
gone
out
of
his
way
to
say
that
not
only
have
you
got
that
but
no
person
shall
intimidate,
threaten,
coerce,
attempt
to
intimidate,
threaten
or
coerce
you
for
exercising
it,
you
shall
not
be
punished,
no
person
shall
attempt
to
punish
you.
and
then
i
would
--
would
be
i
think,
a
pretty
bad
lawyer
if
i
stop
there
because
what
i
ought
to
tell
him
is
that
if
the
restaurateur
wanted
to
deny
him
service,
he
wouldn't
do
it
on
the
ground
that
the
restaurant
wasn't
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
anymore.
he
would
do
it
precisely
on
the
ground
that
there
was
some
boisterousness
or
he
would
deny
it
on
the
ground
that
rachel
when
he
came
in
was
ill-dressed
or
that
he
was
drunk,
whether
he
ogled
the
waitress
or
anyone
of
a
whole
host
of
other
grounds
which
might
give
the
restaurateur
under
the
georgia
statute
a
right
to
exclude
it.
now
on
that
question
of
fact
depends
the
effective
enforcement
of
this
court's
hamm
and
lupper
decisions
and
the
effective
enforcement
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
and
we
suppose
that
a
federal
district
court
was
deemed
by
congress
to
be
a
better
form,
a
more
appropriate
form
for
the
trial
of
this
federal
issue
than
a
state
judge
or
state
jury.
if
i
had
to
tell
thomas
rachel
in
my
hypothetical
case,
what
he
could
expect
in
the
event
that
the
restaurateur
denied
him
service
on
the
ground
that
he
was
boisterous
or
annoys
the
--
or
ogled
the
waitress,
i
would
tell
him
that
what
would
happen
is
that
he
would
go
trial
and
this
mr.
justice
fortas,
goes
back
to
the
question
of
what
in
fact
happens
in
the
state
court
but
not
a
particular
state
court.
state
courts
generally,
i
would
tell
him
that
the
risk
that
he
runs
when
he
is
arrested
is
that
bail
will
set
--
be
set
when
as
--
it
was
for
one
of
the
removal
petitioners
in
this
case,
at
$7000
for
misdemeanor.
now,
it
may
well
be
that
we
can
challenge
that,
we
can
bring
other
proceedings,
habeas
corpus
in
a
state
court
or
up
to
the
state
highest
court
go
into
a
federal
district
court
to
challenge
bail
perhaps.
in
the
amount
of
time
that
it
takes
us
to
get
a
judge,
you
may
have
spent
a
night
or
you
may
have
spent
two
nights
in
jail
but
we
can
eventually
challenge
it
and
perhaps
we
have
to
go
through
several
courts
to
challenge
it.
then
what
will
happen
to
you
is
that
you'll
be
brought
to
trial
in
a
state
court.
the
state
court
will
be
sitting
right
across
ordinarily
from
the
chief
of
police
office
with
the
officers
wondering
in
and
out
of
the
courtroom.
and
how
your
witnesses
will
testify
and
how
the
ordinary
southern
lawyer
will
try
your
case
defending
you
is
going
to
be
very,
very
effectively
influenced
by
the
fact
that
the
courtroom
is
right
across
from
the
chief
of
police,
right
across
from
the
mayor's
office.
and
that
the
court
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
general
attitude
with
respect
to
defense
lawyers
is
--
and
of
all
lawyers
and
rightfully
is
of
great
deference
to
the
court.
and
where
the
suspicion
is
that
the
court
is
hostile
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
more
than
a
presumption.
it
is
a
conclusive
presumption
of
the
law.
it
just
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
it
is.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
intend
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
intend
to
get
just
there
and
when
i
spoke
of
history,
it
was
exactly
in
that
sense
that
i
meant
that
history
was
illuminating
and
indeed
we
think
controlling
in
this
case.
i
was
merely
pointing
out
why
congress
could've
made
the
judgment
that
we
think
it
may.
now,
to
establish
that
it
did
make
the
judgment,
we
have
gone
through
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
which
passed
a
hundred
years
ago
this
month,
laid
the
foundation
for
removal
jurisdiction
claimed
in
this
case.
i
ought
to
say
that
in
connection
with
the
legislative
history,
we
do
not
claim
any
more
than
we
do
with
respect
to
the
language
that
there's
anything
in
there
specifically
which
compels
this
court
to
the
result
we
contend
for.
in
the
sense
of
any
explanation
of
the
statute
on
the
floor
of
congress
or
any
supposition
of
the
cases
that
would
arise
under
it,
the
judiciary
provisions
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
were
relatively
undiscussed.
the
structure
of
the
original
statute
was
to
create
original
jurisdiction
as
well
as
removal
jurisdiction.
the
only
discussion
of
the
provision
at
all
was
by
senator
trumbull,
responsive
to
a
criticism
by
president
johnson
and
his
veto
because
the
criticism
was
slanted,
that
only
part
of
the
jurisdiction,
the
response
was
only
partial
and
we
find
no
illumination
in
the
specific
legislative
history
but
we
find
the
extraordinary
illumination
in
a
larger
panorama
of
history
here
because
we
think
that
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
the
history
of
use
of
the
federal
judiciary
to
enforce
federal
rights
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
particular
instance.
you
find
that
the
reconstruction
period,
the
period
in
which
the
statute
was
enacted
is
the
watershed
that
prior
to
the
reconstruction
period,
the
federal
courts
albeit
the
constitution,
gave
the
congress
power
to
establish
lower
federal
courts.
lower
federal
courts
were
very
seldom
used.
it
wasn't
even
a
general
federal
question
jurisdiction
as
we
know
it
today.
and
a
massive
business,
above
the
business
which
the
federal
courts
do
today,
they
were
giving
in
the
five
or
six
years
following
the
civil
war.
now,
the
second
thing
that
i
think
stands
out
is
one
that
looks
back
at
the
historical
panorama
is
that
the
principle
concern
of
the
reconstruction
congress
is
which
bulked
up
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
and
gave
them
the
protected
jurisdiction
which
they
have
today
was
with
the
pretention
of
the
civil
rights
which
were
gained
by
the
war,
secured
and
assured
by
--
substantively
by
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
and
by
the
civil
rights
act.
every
civil
rights
act,
everyone
had
jurisdictional
provisions
which
gave
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction.
now,
let's
take
a
look
for
one
moment
what
that
jurisdiction
is.
to
start
with,
in
cases
without
regard
to
a
mail
unlike
general
federal
questions
jurisdiction,
the
federal
courts
have
civil
jurisdiction
in
all
cases
involving
civil
rights.
they
have
it
originally.
they
have
it
in
equity.
they
have
it
in
law.
they
have
the
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
given
by
a
statute
in
1867
whose
clear
purpose
was
to
allow
them
to
take
from
state
custody,
persons
in
restraint
by
the
state
executive
with
or
without
state
judicial
process
where
their
federal
rights
were
being
violated.
the
federal
courts,
in
short,
have
very
extensive
civil
rights
jurisdiction.
now
a
question
arises,
did
not
congress
--
would
not
congress
have
foreseen
that
the
major
threat
perhaps
to
the
civil
rights
just
secured
by
the
war
and
by
the
amendments
would
not
come
in
civil
cases.
it
would
not
come
solely
in
cases
in
which
the
state
executive
was
acting
but
was
very
often
come
in
criminal
prosecutions
by
the
state
in
which
the
freedmen
and
the
unions
is
in
itself
were
prosecuted
and
we
know
congress
knew
this
because
the
debates
which
we've
set
out
at
pages
45
to
66
of
this
brief,
if
they
mean
anything,
mean
that
congress
knew
that
the
state
courts
were
hostile
and
that
state
court
actions
were
being
used
to
harass
unionists
and
negroes
in
the
south.
we
asked,
wouldn't
congress
have
done
something
about
that
and
we
conclude
that
they
did.
we
look
at
the
first
thing
they
did
in
reconstruction,
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
and
that
first
thing
they
did,
allows
removal
of
civil
and
criminal
cases
in
three
basic
categories.
the
only
one
of
them
and
the
third
is
in
issue
here
but
the
other
two
we
think
are
very
illuminating.
first
of
all,
federal
officers
enforcing
civil
rights
laws,
whatever
else
section
1443
(2)
means,
it
certainly
means
and
everybody
agrees
that
a
federal
officer
or
unionist
who
is
enforcing
the
civil
rights
act
could
remove
under
it.
he
wouldn't
have
to
show
case
by
case
that
the
state
courts
were
unfair.
he
wouldn't
have
to
show
that
the
state
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
the
very
fact
that
he
was
a
federal
officer
involved
in
civil
rights
enforcement
would
allow
them
to
remove.
secondly,
and
i
think
this
is
extremely
important
although
we
don't
rely
on
it
specifically
in
this
case.
a
state
officer
who
refused
to
do
an
act
on
the
ground
that
it
will
be
inconsistent
with
civil
rights
law
is
permitted
to
remove.
a
state
officer,
he
is
not
a
person
protected
by
federal
law,
he
is
permitted
to
remove
this
case
to
a
federal
court
simply
because
the
issue
of
his
authority
which
he
refuses
to
exercise
involves
federal
civil
rights
law.
he
doesn't
have
to
show
that
the
state
courts
are
not
fair.
he
does
not
have
to
show
that
they
will
not
sustain
the
federal
constitution.
he
does
not
have
to
show
that
there
is
a
state
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
all
that
he
has
to
show
is
that
he
is
a
state
officer,
being
prosecuted
for
an
act
or
a
failure
to
act
in
this
case
which
he
says
would
conflict
with
federal
law.
we
asked
then
if
these
two
classes
of
persons,
federal
officers
enforcing
the
law
and
state
officers
who
refuse
to
violate
it
or
for
that
reason
alone,
given
the
right
to
come
into
the
federal
courts.
did
not
congress
mean
or
would
it
not
also
have
meant
to
allow
the
very
persons
protected
by
the
amendment
and
by
the
federal
civil
rights
act
persons
who
were
denied
their
right
in
a
state
court
to
come
into
the
federal
court
on
that
ground
alone.
we
believe
that's
exactly
what
they
meant
with
section
1443
(2).
now,
let
me
very
carefully
distinguish
two
kinds
of
cases
because
usually
we
get
into
the
rives
line
as
well.
we
think
that
congress
was
thinking
about
two
situations.
first
is
a
situation
in
which
a
state
charge
is
brought
against
someone
for
conduct
in
the
exercise
of
a
federal
civil
right.
now
to
take
one
of
the
civil
rights
of
section
1
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866,
we'll
take
the
right
to
possess
property.
suppose
that
a
negro
got
a
grant
in
fee
of
a
piece
of
property
and
a
white
man
came
and
tried
to
throw
him
of
it,
tried
to
evict
him
forcibly
on
the
ground
that
he
couldn't
hold
property
and
that
the
white
man
was
entitled
to
the
property.
ordinary
state
law
would
allow
defense
by
force
of
one's
habitation
against
an
aggressor.
we
have
no
doubt
that
that
right
of
self-defense
was
protected
by
section
1
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
we
think
that
in
cases
like
that,
congress
made
the
conclusive
presumption
of
law
that
because
federal
civil
rights
were
involved
in
this
case
and
because
the
potential
for
harassment
of
granting
these
cases
through
the
state
courts
intermittently,
the
problems
i
raised
earlier,
trying
them
in
front
of
a
potentially
hostile
state
judge
who
will
influence
what
lawyers
do
by
his
very
presence,
who
will
influence
the
way
witnesses
testified,
who
has
enormous
discretion
on
questions
of
bail,
who
has
enormous
discretion
on
questions
of
timing
and
when
the
case
comes
before
the
court,
how
long
it
shall
be
held
up.
these
cases
are
cases
in
which
we
think
congress
meant
the
case
immediately
to
go
into
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
of
course.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
and
under
our
construction
of
the
statute,
it
is
to
be
made
by
a
federal
judge
after
a
removal
petition
has
been
filed
and
in
the
event
that
a
remand
motion
challenging
the
factual
allegations
of
the
petition
is
filed.
we
completely
agree
--
and
this
i
think
is
also
the
answer
in
part
to
why
i
earlier
responded
mr.
justice
white
as
i
did,
that
the
factual
question
is
critical.
but
we
think
congress
meant
precisely
because
of
the
power
of
a
state
court
to
find
the
facts
against
a
federal
petitioner
and
because
of
the
inconvenience
of
litigating
those
issues
in
the
state
court
and
the
threat
to
federal
rights
if
they
--
one
who
goes
out
to
sit
in
a
restaurant
knows
that
he's
going
to
go
to
trial
in
a
state
court.
we
think
that
the
how,
when
and
where
is
in
a
federal
court
on
a
motion
to
remand
in
advance
of
any
trial.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
and
by
a
judge
without
a
jury.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
remand
to
the
state
court
where
a
trial
by
jury
has
had
and
this
is
not,
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
this
i
understand
--
i
understand
this
to
be
the
government's
position
in
peacock.
that
what
the
government
says
is
that
--
and
verbally,
i
think
there's
very
good
basis
for
this.
the
government
seems
to
say
that
the
--
particularly
under
subsection
(2)
that
the
question
of
color
of
authority
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i'm
sure
that's
right.
that
wherever
the
case
is
within
--
as
it
were,
shooting
distance
of
the
constitution,
the
whole
case
comes
over
into
the
federal
courts
and
you
try
it
there.
constitutional
defenses,
federal
defenses
and
the
state
law
question
all
at
once.
we
don't
think
that
that
is
what
congress
meant.
now,
we
would
be
delighted
to
have
that
kind
of
an
expansive
reading
of
the
statute.
we
don't
ask
for
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
i
think
that
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
i
think
that
the
only
objection
that
i
have
to
characterizing
as
narrow
or
limited
to
our
case,
the
government's
contention
is
that
it
would
also
apply
beyond
sit-ins
to
demonstration
cases
generally.
as
i
understand
the
government,
it
takes
the
position
that
judge
friendly
assumed
in
galamison
that
if
the
conduct
is
colorably
protected
by
federal
law
then
trial
is
had
on
the
merits
in
a
federal
court
to
a
jury.
now,
i
understand
the
government's
desire
for
that.
it
comes
from
two
things
as
i
understand
it,
one,
a
feeling
that
efficiency
is
served
if
a
single
trial
was
had
instead
of
two
trials.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
don't
disagree
with
that
but
we
do
disagree
with
some
of
the
factual
assumptions
that
underlie
it.
and
we
also
think
that
there
are
countervailing
considerations
to
efficiency,
one
of
which
is
that
under
our
construction
of
the
statute,
we
can
honestly
say
that
no
cases
taken
out
of
the
state
court,
in
no
cases
the
state
court
deprive
the
power
to
proceed
except
the
cases
shouldn't
be
there
in
the
first
place.
that's
the
virtue
i
think
of
our
construction
of
the
removal
statute.
the
government's
construction
of
the
removal
statute
allows
the
federal
mechanism
to
come
in
to
operation
even
in
cases
which
can
proceed
the
judgment.
ours
is
very
limited.
we
think
that
the
optimal
balance
to
be
struck
between
the
use
of
the
federal
courts
to
protect
federal
rights
and
the
necessity
that
state
courts
go
on
and
on
impede
it
in
cases
where
federal
rights
are
not
being
denied
simply
calls
for
trying
whether
or
not
federal
protection
does
by
the
prosecution
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
exactly
so
and
that
brings
me
to
the
gov
--
to
what
i
think
is
the
second
consideration
that
informs
the
government's
point
because
certainly
in
terms
of
efficiency
you
can't
quarrel
the
efficiency
of
that.
and
if
one
wants
to
talk
about
efficiency,
you
can
compare
what
happened
in
southern
alabama,
for
example,
with
the
various
other
large
demonstration
episodes
that
have
happened
all
over
the
country.
within
three
months,
the
southern
alabama
demonstrations
and
the
3,000
prosecutions
arising
out
of
them
were
finished,
terminated,
ended.
a
federal
district
judge
on
a
motion
to
remand
in
a
removed
case
found
that
all
of
those
prosecutions
were
unfounded,
that
is
to
say,
that
the
conduct
from
which
they
were
--
on
which
they
were
based
was
protected
by
the
federal
constitution
and
washed
all
of
those
cases
out
properly.
had
it
not
been
for
that,
the
cases
would
still
be
in
the
middle
of
trial
and
appeal
and
we
would
have
what
we
had
in
mississippi
freedom
writer
case,
another
case
to
six
years
to
the
vindication
of
right.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
exactly
that
and
there
is
nothing
anomalous
about
it
because
we
think
that
even
if
this
case
were
tried
in
the
state
courts,
as
i
said
earlier,
that
the
issue
of
federal
defense
as
distinguished
from
the
issue
of
guilt
would
have
to
be
tried
by
the
judge
and
not
the
jury.
we
do
not
think
that
federal
constitutional
defenses
even
in
a
state
court
or
jury
issues.
now
the
trial
judge,
just
to
make
very
specific
what
i
mean,
a
trial
judge
to
whom
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
submitted
either
just
before
verdict
or
just
after
verdict.
in
a
case
like
edwards
and
south
carolina
for
example,
would
have
to
decide
himself
whether
or
not
the
facts
as
testified
to
by
the
police
officers
on
the
one
side
and
the
demonstrators
on
the
other,
showed
federal
constitutional
protection.
now,
he
could
say
to
counsel,
“counsel,
i
--
i'm
willing
to
go
with
what
12
good
men
(inaudible)
say.”
and
treat
that
that's
an
advisory
verdict.
they
have
to
decide
the
issue
of
guilt
as
to
whether
or
not
these
people
were
obstructing
the
street
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
that's
the
same
fact
question,
is
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
on
federal
habeas
corpus
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--
or
do
you
mean
a
trial?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
that
it
can
be
raised
in
the
state
court
and
we
have
that
position
exactly
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
sure.
no
question
about
that.
we
have
that
today
exactly
in
a
two
trial
system.
we
have
a
post
conviction
federal
habeas
corpus.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
state
--
the
facts
established
in
the
state
court
may
not
be
the
same
as
those
established
in
a
federal
court.
and
if
the
state
court
wrongly
applies
federal
law
with
the
facts
found
in
the
state
court
that
would
be
a
federal
constitutional
violation
just
as
it
is
today.
this
court
can
reverse
as
it
did
in
edwards
and
south
carolina,
a
state
court
proceeding
in
which
on
the
facts
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
raises
a
difficult
question.
ordinarily
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
ordinarily
there
can
only
be
one
removal
petition.
the
reason
i
boggled
with
that
was
simply
that
in
this
case,
and
this
is
one
of
the
issues
that
i
think
is
pertinent
to
whether
or
not
we're
properly
up
here
on
appeal.
i
think
that
we
could
if
we
were
now
sent
back
on
the
procedural
ground
that
the
appeal
wasn't
timely
filed
--
filed
a
new
one
because
the
first
one
was
filed
as
we
pointed
out
before
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
i
have
one
--
before
we
had
any
ground
of
the
sort
that
we
now
seek
to
sustain
removal
on
for
removing
and
i
think
that
the
first
opportunity
that
we
have
to
raise
the
substantive
claims
here
we
could
raise
them
again.
but
ordinarily,
only
one
petition
could
be
filed.
i
don't
think
that
is
inconsistent
at
all
with
the
position
that,
if
the
case
were
remanded
for
the
state
court,
trial
should
be
had
on
the
facts
of
the
federal
constitutional
issue.
again,
today,
federal
habeas
corpus
will
lie
in
order
to
give
every
litigant
having
a
federal
claim
one
chance
to
try
his
federal
issue
before
a
federal
judge.
that
doesn't
mean
two
chances.
it
doesn't
mean
that
because
one
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
can
be
filed
that
two
can
be
or
that
three
can
be.
it
only
means
that
he
has
a
right
to
have
a
federal
court
find
the
facts.
but
he
also
has
a
right
to
have
a
state
court
apply
federal
law
right
on
the
facts
found
in
a
state
proceeding.
so,
i
do
not
believe
that
if
a
federal
court
remands
after
finding
that
there's
no
constitutional
protection
that
he
is
deprived
of
the
opportunity
of
raising
the
federal
issue.
new
facts
may
turn
up
at
the
hearing
in
the
state
court.
it
may
well
be
that
the
state
officer
testify
somewhat
differently
than
he
did
at
the
federal
court.
and
at
that
point,
he
has
a
right
to
say
to
the
state
judge
on
a
testimony
which
you've
jus
heard
your
honor,
the
federal
constitution
has
been
violated
in
this
case
and
we
invoke
it.
and
we
think
that
the
state
court
is
obligated
to
entertain
that
federal
constitutional
defense.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
let
me
answer
that
by
specific
reference
but
i
ought
to
say
one
thing
before
i
do.
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
earlier
whether
or
not
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
right.
the
allegation
in
page
2
of
the
removal
petition
and
this
is
exemplary.
this
is
the
one
group
of
petitioners
but
its
exemplary
as
to
the
others
is
that
the
petitioner
sought
to
obtain
service,
food,
entertainment
and
comfort
at
leb's
restaurant,
a
restaurant
open
to
the
general
public,
66
luckie
street,
atlanta,
georgia.
the
further
allegation
is
that
they
were
arrested
on
this
occasion
for
the
sole
purpose,
and
this
is
on
page
1,
of
aiding,
abetting
and
perpetuating
customs
and
usages
having
historical
and
psychological
roots
with
respect
to
serving
in
sitting
members
of
the
negro
race
in
places
of
public
accommodation
and
convenience
on
a
racially
discriminatory
basis
and
upon
terms
and
conditions
not
imposed
on
members
of
the
so-called
white
or
caucasian
race.
it
is
further
alleged
on
page
4
of
the
record
conclusorally
that
the
petitioners
are
being
prosecuted
for
acts
on
under
color
of
authority
derived
from
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
now
that
is
a
characterization
of
the
earlier
allegations,
which
is
that
having
entered
restaurants
with
described
addresses
and
restaurants
which
it
is
alleged
were
open
to
the
public.
they
were
refused
service
in
a
racially
discriminatory
basis.
now,
we
have
no
doubt
that
looked
at
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
this
is
a
sufficient
allegation,
although
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
no.
they
are
--
one
couldn't
make
more
specific
allegations
of
fact
on
two
issues.
as
we
understand
it,
there
are
three
issues
which
have
to
be
shown
to
demonstrate
hamm
and
--
that
hamm
and
lupper
applies.
one,
that
there
is
a
restaurant
involved.
two,
that
it's
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
and
three,
that
service
was
refused
on
racial
grounds.
the
allegation
that
it's
a
restaurant,
leb's,
a
privately
owned
restaurant
open
to
the
general
public,
66
luckie
street,
it's
impossible
to
allege
that
in
greater
factual
detail.
the
allegation
that
service
was
refused
on
grounds
of
racial
discrimination
is
the
allegation
that
these
people
were
--
they
were
seeking
service,
they
were
arrested
for
doing
so
pursuant
to
a
deep
ceded
custom
etcetera
of
racial
discrimination
and
public
service.
again,
you
could
not
allege
more
--
in
more
detail
as
a
matter
of
fact.
now,
the
only
question
and
this
is
the
only
one
on
which
the
petition
is
deficient
is
in
specifically
alleging
coverage
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
i
think
that's
a
paper
issue
because
i
don't
think
that
in
this
court,
georgia
has
--
i
don't
think
it
could,
i
don't
think
it
will
state
that
leb's
or
davis
house
number
three
in
the
heart
of
atlanta,
georgia
are
not
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
but
we
think
that
even
if
they
did,
the
factual
allegations
are
quite
sufficient.
the
factual
allegation
is
66
luckie
street.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
a
court
sitting
in
a
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
yes.
and
right
after
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
hamm
and
lupper
have
already
bridged
them
we
think,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
if
hamm
and
lupper
protected
prosecutions
on
the
theory
as
i
understand
it's
a
basis
of
your
honor's
question
that
once
a
1964
act
was
passed,
from
that
point
on
it
constituted
a
punishment
or
harassment
under
203
to
continue
with
those
prosecution.
but
that
it
did
not
necessarily
invalidate
a
state
arrest
prior
to
that.
i
would
go
along
with
your
honor
on
that.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
completely
agree.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
right.
i
have
no
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
have
no
complaint
with
that
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
i
may
add,
well,
i
put
my
stress
on
the
notion
that
they
were
denied
their
rights
by
the
arrest
then
that
they
cannot
enforce
them
in
a
state
proceeding
which
his
now
existing.
but
what
we
have
here
is
a
proceeding
in
which
on
july
2nd,
1964,
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
act
was
pending.
at
that
point,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
became
applicable.
the
federal
court
which
had
the
cases
at
that
time
was
authorized
to
remand
the
proceedings
or
to
entertain
jurisdiction.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
let
me
see
if
this
is
a
satisfactory
way
of
doing
it
because
this
seems
to
me
--
of
course
we
point,
necessarily
needs
follow.
the
complaint
we
make
of
the
state
prosecution
in
this
case
is
that
it
itself
constitutes
not
the
arrest
but
the
prosecution
constitutes
an
intimidation,
threat,
coercion,
a
punishment
or
an
attempt
to
punish,
the
language
relied
on
in
hamm
and
lupper,
these
three
civil
rights
act
of
1964
demonstrations,
sit-ins.
now,
we
say
that
as
of
july
2nd,
1964,
it
became
impermissible
for
the
state
to
maintain
prosecutions
whose
effect
was
to
harass,
intimidate,
coerce,
punish
persons
for
the
exercise
of
the
right
or
for
seeking
--
i
won't
put
it
in
terms
of
exercise
of
a
right,
there
wasn't
a
right
then.
but
the
statute
said
and
this
court
held
in
hamm
and
lupper
that
a
state
could
not
now
punish
pre-act
conduct
which
was
simply
sitting
in
a
restaurant
seeking
service.
we
think
that
at
that
point,
a
federal
court
which
has
the
case
is
called
upon
just
as
this
court
called
on
all
state
courts
which
had
such
cases
in
hamm
and
lupper
to
look
at
the
case
before
it
and
decide
whether
or
not
the
case
is
indeed
a
punishment,
harassment,
etcetera.
if
it
is,
we
believe
that
that
in
itself
falls
into
effect
the
removal
statute
which
is
intended
to
give
federal
jurisdiction
to
decide
just
such
a
question.
now
we
do
not
for
that
purpose
have
to
rely
on
the
principle
that
the
arrest
were
illegal
at
the
time
made
although
if
necessary,
we
adhere
to
arguments
previously
made
in
this
court
prior
to
hamm
and
lupper
which
we
think
the
court
need
not
made
--
need
not
reach
that
the
constitution
protected
the
conduct
alleged
in
this
case
whether
--
well,
as
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
if
there
is
indeed
--
if
the
court
should
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
does
not
bar
the
prosecution
as
in
this
case
or
is
not
invocable
as
a
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction
then
we
indeed
have
a
question
here
that
we
have
in
the
peacock
case.
except
that
we
have
in
additional
substantive
question,
the
one
left
open
in
bell
and
other
cases
to
whether
or
not
the
conduct
here
alleged
is
indeed
protected
by
the
constitution.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
don't
purport
to
speak
with
authority
in
what
was
in
fact
done
in
watts.
my
recollection
is
that
no
attempt
was
made
to
remove
any
of
those
cases
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
there
has
indeed
been.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
galamison
opinion
in
the
second
circuit
effectively
barred
removal
of
cases
under
the
various
theories
put
forth
in
the
present
cases
in
the
second
circuit.
however,
there
have
subsequently
been
attempts
to
remove
and
in
the
hutchinson
case,
for
example,
and
others,
stays
have
been
given
and
there
are
cases
pending
in
the
second
circuit,
yes.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
certainly
does
and
it's
quite
unlike
in
that
regard
the
amendatory
freedmen's
bureau
act
which
gave
fed
--
general
federal
jurisdiction
in
military
tribunals
but
only
in
the
south.
this
one
was
intended
to
be
forever
and
it
was
intended
to
be
in
all
the
states
forever
and
our
argument
doesn't
rest
as
i
say,
on
this
court's
finding
or
any
federal
district
court's
finding
that
the
superior
court
of
fulton
county,
georgia
is
unfair
or
biased,
whether
the
--
in
the
state
courts
in
mississippi
are
unfair,
biased,
the
state
courts
throughout
the
south
are
unfair
and
biased.
we
claim
that
congress
has
made
the
judgment
about
state
courts
generally
that
just
as
in
diversity
cases.
just
as
in
federal
question
cases,
the
rights
of
a
federal
claimant
need
a
federal
judge
to
protect
them
and
that
from
the
outset
that
in
cases
involving
civil
rights,
criminal
cases
in
which
civil
rights
defenses
are
presented
and
can
be
sustained
on
the
facts
in
front
of
the
federal
judge
the
case
should
be
tried
in
front
of
a
federal
judge
and
not
in
front
of
a
state
judge
in
new
york,
in
california
or
in
fulton
county,
georgia.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
my
argument
doesn't
begin
to
go
to
that
question
because
the
only
case
in
which
i
seek
to
sustain
removal
jurisdiction
is
a
case
in
which
the
affidavit,
the
verified
removal
petition
asserts
not
that
he
is
being
prejudiced
on
account
of
color
or
that
the
jury
is
prejudiced
to
the
judge's
prejudice.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
that
--
our
argument
would
not
allow
removal
in
those
cases.
our
argument
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh!
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
justice
black,
that
is
absolutely
true
but
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
my
argument
or
how
this
court
decides
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes.
but
you
see,
congress
has
provided
that
if
a
removal
petition
is
filed,
the
state
court
proceeding
stops.
now
no
matter
what
you
say
about
the
scope
of
the
removal
jurisdiction
or
where
he
can
always
file
that
paper,
if
he's
going
to
be
dishonest.
i
think
the
only
way
in
which
this
court
can
protect
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
way
in
which
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
real
risk
it
--
the
risk
it
seems
to
me
of
interruption
of
state
court
process
that
flows
from
the
removal
jurisdiction
is
two
separate
risks.
one,
that
the
removal
jurisdiction
will
be
in
fact
broader
than
it
ought
to
be
and
the
cases
which
should
not
be
brought
into
the
federal
court
will
be
brought
there
and
will
stay
there.
the
second
one
is
the
risk
that
the
jurisdiction
will
be
abused
because
counsel
will
file
frivolous
papers.
it
will
take
it
into
the
federal
court.
in
your
hypothetical
case
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
not
sustain
removal
and
so
the
first
court
will
--
the
first
question
whether
or
not
the
federal
courts
have
taken
jurisdiction
announced
to
the
state
court
in
a
case
in
which
they
should
not
is
not
in
the
case.
and
the
second
one
in
which
counsel
are
filing
wrongly
that
maybe
either
because
of
a
mistake
of
law
or
because
they're
abusing
the
process.
a
clear
decision
by
this
court
is
to
the
scope
of
1443
will
end
i
think
such
mistakes
of
law.
as
per
abuse
by
counsel,
that
is
inherent
or
its
potentiality
is
inherent
whether
you
stick
with
the
reason
that
was
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
but
they're
not
removable
under
our
theory.
our
theory
allows
removal
only
where
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
our
theory
of
removal
would
not
authorize
removal
in
that
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
exactly.
that's
the
only
case
in
which
we're
arguing
for
removal.
the
fact
that
a
fellow
is
a
negro,
can't
get
a
fair
trial
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--
all
of
that
is
immaterial.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
those
cases
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
exactly.
those
cases
are
covered
by
rives-powers
and
we
do
not
ask
for
their
reconsideration
here.
we
do
not
need
to,
to
reach
this
case
and
we
do
not
ask
for
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
of
the
several
grounds
which
georgia
urges
for
reversal
here,
one,
the
construction
of
a
civil
rights
removal
statute
is
of
overwhelming
importance.
mr.
sparks
has
just
said
eloquently
i
think
that
state
prosecutors
in
the
federal
district
courts
need
guidance
in
this
matter.
and
the
question
is
involved
not
only
in
this
case
and
in
the
peacock
case
which
follows
but
in
others
pending
here
and
many
pending
in
the
lower
courts.
i
perhaps
should
say
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
to
mr.
mcpherson
yesterday
that
the
issues
in
this
case,
rachel,
are
not
exactly
the
same
as
those
in
peacock
and
that
it
might
well
be
that
peacock
might
be
decided
in
favor
of
a
remanded
state
court,
although,
jurisdiction
in
the
rachel
case
would
be
sustained.
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
decide
the
cases
the
other
way
around
but
the
issues
are
not
exactly
the
same.
because
of
the
importance
of
the
issues,
because
congress
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
deemed
their
resolution
by
this
court
essential
to
the
effective
protection
of
federal
civil
rights
by
the
federal
courts.
i
would
like
to
argue
that
question,
the
question
of
construction
of
section
1443
of
the
judicial
code.
first,
notwithstanding
the
slight
branch
in
strict
logic
that's
involved
in
putting
off
until
later
the
question
raised
by
mr.
mcpherson
as
to
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
substantive
contention
on
the
merits.
now
on
the
issue
of
statutory
construction,
the
text
which
we
must
construe
is
set
out
at
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
and
i
mean
to
refer
to
it
at
this
time
not
to
argue
the
case
under
the
language
of
the
statute
but
merely
to
outline
and
i
thought
that
it
might
be
helpful
to
the
court,
the
various
possible
constructions
of
the
statute
and
the
contentions
made
not
only
by
the
parties
here
but
also
by
various
lower
courts
that
have
passed
on
the
questions.
i
do
this
because
as
i
shall
say
in
a
minute,
i
don't
think
that
the
question
in
this
case
is
one
that
can
be
decided
as
a
matter
of
language.
i
do
not
think
that
syllogistic
work
with
words.
i
do
not
think
that
punctuation.
i
do
not
think
that
grammar
is
the
answer
to
this
case.
i
think
its
answer
is
in
history
and
i
think
its
answer
is
in
the
practical
functioning
of
the
civil
rights
jurisdiction
in
this
country
today.
questions
i
shall
come
to
very
shortly
in
this
argument.
now,
looking
at
the
language
of
the
statute
for
the
moment
just
for
the
purpose
of
outlining
the
possible
constructions
of
it,
i
turn
first
to
section
1443
(2)
because,
although,
the
fifth
circuit
below
decided
this
case
on
section
1443
(1)
as
i
shall
make
clear
i
hope
a
little
later
in
the
argument,
i
myself
would
prefer
to
see
the
court
rest
affirmance
of
the
decision
below
which
you
can
do
on
section
1443
(2).
and
also
because
mr.
sparks
has
argued
implications
for
this
case
from
the
rives-powers
line
of
decisions
and
those
decisions
or
constructions
only
of
section
1443
(1)
leaving
the
court
entirely
free
i
believe
to
construe
for
the
first
time
in
this
case
and
the
peacock
case
following
section
1443
(2).
now,
1443
(2)
allows
removal
where
a
prosecution
is
for
any
act
under
color
of
authority
derived
from
any
law
providing
for
equal
rights.
there
is
also
a
refusing
clause
in
section
1443
(2)
which
we
do
not
rely
on
in
this
court
which
i
believe
the
petitioners
in
peacock
removed
--
petitioners
in
peacock
do
rely
on,
we
do
not.
we
construe
the
phrase,
“any
act
under
color
of
authority
derived
from
the
law
providing
for
equal
rights,”
to
mean,
any
act
which
is
authorized
by
a
federal
law
protecting
civil
rights
which
is
permitted
by
a
federal
law
providing
for
equal
rights
which
is
protected
by
a
federal
law
providing
for
equal
rights.
we
read
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
do
not
need
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case
because
the
rights
which
we
claim
in
this
case
are
protected
expressly
by
sections
201
and
203
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
which
georgia
has
not
contended,
it's
not
a
law
providing
for
equal
rights
which
i
think
no
law
or
federal
court
has
began
to
suggest
is
not
and
which
i
think
clearly
is.
so,
we
need
not
reach
the
constitutional
question
in
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
removal
petition
was
filed
in
this
case
and
the
case
remanded
before
the
civil
rights
act
was
passed.
i
don't
think
that
that
affects
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no,
not
at
all.
hamm
and
lupper
have
resolved
the
question
i
take
it
as
to
whether
or
not
the
substantive
protection
of
the
act
applies
in
such
cases.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
federal
jurisdiction
is
proper
in
such
cases
is
a
question
whether
a
statute
governing
the
jurisdiction
of
courts
should
apply
to
pending
cases.
now
traditionally,
a
procedural
removal
statute
is
applied
to
pending
cases.
i
see
no
reason
why
if
a
substantive
provision
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
do
not
begin
to
operate
as
of
july
2nd,
1964
but
relayed
back,
i
see
no
reason
why
we
would
remove
under
the
statutes
dating
from
1866
should
not
have
the
benefit
of
that.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
question
i
think
is
only
whether
or
not
we
should
have
alleged
with
greater
particularity
when
we
did
the
rights
which
we
now
seek
to
assert
because
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
exactly
our
position.we
think
that
as
far
as
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
absolutely
your
honor,
that
--
that
of
course,
at
that
point,
the
question
was
before
this
court
which
the
court
has
never
resolved
as
to
the
constitutional
protection
of
the
conduct
which
we
claim
now
as
protected
under
the
civil
rights
act.
and
it
was
under
the
constitution
that
we
originally
sought
to
remove
but
unless
this
court
should
find
that
because
our
pleadings
are
insufficient
or
for
some
other
reason,
hamm
and
lupper
does
not
reach
and
protect
this
case.
there
need
be
reach
no
constitutional
question
in
this
case
nor
any
question
as
to
whether
section
1443
and
its
phrase
“law
providing
for
equal
rights”
means
anything
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
now,
the
state
of
georgia
has
taken
the
position
that
an
act
under
color
of
authority
means
an
act
under
color
of
office.
and
it
is
when
that
in
effect
that
the
federal
officers
and
the
persons
acting
under
them.
and
this
is
a
position
which
has
since
been
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
peacock
case
although
in
rogers
in
tuscaloosa
and
other
panel
of
the
fifth
circuit
regarded
the
question
it's
still
open
there.
the
third
possible
construction
of
section
1443
(2)
which
should
command
the
consideration
of
the
court
is
that
by
judge
friendly
in
the
galamison
case
in
the
second
circuit.
judge
friendly
without
resolving
the
question
whether
the
phrase
color
of
authority
meant
color
of
office
and
whether
the
statute
does
reach
anybody
other
than
officers
and
persons
acting
under
them
said
that
authority
derived
from
the
federal
law,
only
a
federal
law
directed
a
specific
act
to
be
done.
an
act
was
authorized
by
under
color
of
authority
of
law
if
it
was
a
direction
given
by
that
law
to
do
the
act.
we
think
that
doesn't
amount
to
very
much
other
than
the
construction
that
the
statute
is
limited
to
officers
and
persons
acting
under
them
because
no
civil
rights
law
that
we
know
of
directs
anybody
to
do
anything
other
than
federal
officers
and
persons
acting
under
them.
so
i
think
that
the
alternatives
meaningfully
in
construction
of
1443
(2)
are
simply,
whether
or
not
under
color
of
authority
means
protected
by
federal
law
and
does
reaches
demonstrators,
sit-ins,
and
persons
who
are
protected
by
federal
law
which
precludes
their
prosecution
or
whether
it
is
limited
to
federal
officers.
and
again
for
the
moment
without
arguing,
we're
just
simply
pointing
out
what
the
alternatives
mean
at
this
point.
i
would
point
out
that
that
second
construction
reached
1443
(2)
off
the
books
because
section
1442
(a)
of
the
judicial
code
today
allows
removal
on
all
federal
office
in
cases
of
civil
rights
or
otherwise
including
persons
acting
under
federal
office.
now
passing
the
1443
(1)
again
merely
with
the
purpose
of
outlining
what
the
issues
are
and
what
the
possible
constructions
are,
1443
(1)
unlike
1443
(2)
asks
a
question
not
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
was
for
the
first
time
broadened
to
include
all
federal
officers
in
the
1948
judicial
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
revenue
officers
only.
the
first
section
of
1443
asks
questions
that
the
second
section
does
not.
it
allows
for
a
removal
only
in
the
case
of
prosecutions
or
civil
cases
against
the
person
who
is
denied
or
cannot
enforce
in
the
state
courts
a
--
an
equal
civil
right
or
right
provided
--
protected
by
a
law,
a
right
under
a
law
providing
for
equal
civil
rights.
now,
the
various
possible
constructions
of
1443
(1)
i
think
are
broader
than
those
of
the
1443
(2).
first
of
all,
there
is
the
construction
of
the
rives-powers
line
of
cases
argued
by
mr.
sparks
this
morning
that
the
denial
spoken
off
by
section
1443
(1)
is
a
denial
which
arises
from
the
face
of
a
state
statute
or
constitution,
unconstitutional
on
its
face
that
where
that
existed
is
both
the
necessary
and
sufficient
condition
of
removal
that
no
question
can
be
asked
whether
the
state
courts
will
uphold
the
state
statute
albeit
unconstitutional
or
will
strike
it
down
and
that
the
one
hallmark
of
removability
is
an
unconstitutional
state
statute.
a
second
possible
interpretation
is
that
when
a
removal
petition
is
filed
as
it
now
must
be
filed
in
advance
of
trial,
the
federal
court
shall
try
case
by
case,
issue
by
issue
the
question
whether
the
removal
petitioner
is
being
denied
or
has
been
denied
and
cannot
enforce
in
the
state
courts
a
right
under
the
constitution
and
laws.
now
for
the
moment,
i'm
treating
the
words
denied
and
cannot
enforce
as
though
they
were
tautologic.
and
i'll
come
to
a
moment
--
in
a
moment
to
the
government's
position
in
peacock
that
they
are
not.
a
position
which
we
don't
have
to
reach
in
our
case
because
we
think
that
the
result
is
the
same,
however
when
used,
those
two
words.
but
any
possibility
in
construing
section
1443
(1)
would
be
to
say
that
the
federal
district
court
on
a
removal
petition
would
try
whether
or
not
a
petitioner
who
is
charged
with
sitting
in,
in
a
--
or
seeking
service
in
a
restaurant
covered
by
the
public
accommodations
title
could
have
his
right
to
the
defense
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
fairly
tried
in
the
state
court.
and
as
i
understand
that
that
is
mr.
sparks
alternative
contention
that
we
look
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
although
why
only
to
that
court,
i'm
not
sure.
why
not
to
judge
price
court
which
this
case
would
be
tried
in
the
first
instance.
however,
we
look
to
the
georgia
court
and
we
try
their
fidelity
to
the
constitution.
will
they
or
will
they
not
obey
the
constitution?
will
they
or
will
they
not
follow
this
court's
decision?
now,
a
third
possible
construction
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
under
this
construction
of
the
statute,
you
would
have
to
try
the
probability
that
the
state
court
would
come
to
an
unconstitutional
result.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
do
that.
i
am
simply
outlining
the
possible
constructions
but
i
haven't
yet
come
to
the
one
we're
urging.
the
third
possible
construction
splits
the
word
denied
and
cannot
enforce
into
two
pieces
and
it
says
that
section
1443
(1)
has
two
rights
to
remove.
a
right
to
remove
where
one
is
denied
a
federal
civil
right
and
a
right
to
remove
or
one
cannot
enforce
a
civil
right
and
it
says
that
wherever
the
conduct
or
which
the
prosecution
is
brought
is
itself
protected
by
a
federal
substantive
guarantee
which
allows
that
conduct
that
the
very
fact
of
the
arrest
in
the
commencement
of
the
prosecution
is
a
denial
of
their
right
and
that
without
reaching
any
question,
it
cannot
enforce
the
prosecution
as
(inaudible)
it's
a
removal.
this,
i
understand
to
be
the
government's
position
in
the
peacock
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
judge
sobeloff
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--
in
the
dissent
in
the
danville
case
did,
i
think
graphically
illustrates
by
punctuation
exactly
how
this
would
work.
i
myself
don't
ask
the
court
to
take
that
position
and
i
don't
because
in
my
judgment,
the
only
justification
for
a
removal
jurisdiction
at
all
is
some
feeling
that
the
state
courts
cannot,
will
not,
do
not
enforce
certain
kinds
of
federal
rights
and
therefore
i
hesitate
to
focus
attention
on
the
arrest
process.
i'm
much
more
concerned
with
the
process
in
the
trial
court.
i
think
i
shall
explain
why
i
think
that
notwithstanding
that,
our
cases
within
the
denial
and
cannot
enforce
language.
now
the
fourth
possible
construction
is
that
which
we
urge
in
this
case
that
because
of
the
inevitable
pendency
and
in
speaking
of
this,
i
do
not
speak
of
the
southern
state
courts
alone.
i
do
not
speak
of
the
courts
in
fulton
county
alone.
i
speak
of
the
natural
effect
of
appending
criminal
prosecution
on
the
kind
of
conduct
which
the
prosecution
has
brought
upon
it
because
of
the
general
deterrent
effect
of
a
prosecution
on
conduct.
we
claim
that
the
very
pendency
of
a
prosecution
in
a
state
court
against
a
person
for
a
federally
protected
right
is
in
itself
a
denial
of
that
right
and
denial
of
the
ability
to
enforce
that
right,
were
to
put
it
exactly
in
mr.
sparks'
language,
we
do
indeed
claim
in
this
case
that
with
respect
to
certain
federal
rights.
those
few
precious
federal
rights
that
congress
has
either
hedged
about
as
it
did
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
with
a
special
guarantee
that
no
one
should
be
coerced,
intimidated,
harassed
or
punished
for
seeking
to
assert
this
right
and
with
some
other
rights
we
need
not
be
reached
in
this
case.
the
first
amendment
rights
involved
in
peacock,
that
the
very
precious
nature
of
those
rights
and
the
suppressive
effect
on
a
prosecution
which
this
court
has
recognized
in
many
cases
over
the
years
is
a
justification
for
a
jurisdiction
which
does
indeed
insulate
from
prosecution
persons
who
engage
in
that
conduct.
now
notice,
when
i
say
insulation
from
prosecution,
all
that
means
is
that
the
question
whether
or
not
the
prosecution
shall
go
on
is
to
be
tried
in
a
federal
court
in
the
first
instance
and
not
in
a
state
court.
and
in
reaching
the
questions
of
construction
which
i've
now
laid
out
in
explaining
why
i
reached
that
result,
i
want
to
pass
if
i
may
from
the
language
to
history
and
then
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
cert
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
pendency
of
the
case
in
the
state
--
in
the
federal
court
does
have
some
effect.
let
me
answer
that
question
in
several
different
ways.
first
of
all,
the
length
of
pendency
is
absolutely
critical.
if
we
compare,
for
example,
the
mississippi
freedom
writer
cases,
the
freedom
rights
were
in
may
of
1961,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
in
a
case
that
was
clearly
controlled
by
this
court's
prior
decision
affirmed
in
1965
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
right
and
when
you
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
thought
that
i
--
when
you
asked
whether
or
not
the
pendency
of
the
case
in
the
federal
court
was
not
repressive
in
the
same
way
that
it
was
in
a
state
court,
my
answer
is
as
a
matter
of
degree,
it
is
critically
different.
it
is
differently
repressive.
it
is
less
repressive
because
the
probability
that
a
federal
district
judge
would
have
allowed
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
there
the
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
if
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
whole
argument
does
indeed
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--
depend
on
that
but
let
me
distinguish
between
two
ways
in
which
that
issue
is
critical.
one
is,
if
case
by
case,
the
federal
court
had
to
decide
the
probabilities
in
a
state
court
and
the
other
is
the
question
whether
congress
has
not
made
the
generic
judgment
about
state
courts
in
these
cases
which
has
ordered
a
federal
court
because
of
the
increase
probability
of
repression
in
the
state
courts
generically
to
take
these
cases
without
inquiring
case
by
case,
instance
by
instance,
whether
or
not
the
state
courts
will
probably
enforce
the
federal
right.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
do
completely
agree.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that's
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
we
can
--
we
are
perfectly
agreeable
to
that.
we
believe
that
a
federal
district
court
if
a
petition
for
removal
is
contested
on
the
facts,
must
try
the
issues
alleged
in
the
petition
and
denied
any
answer.
but
if
a
petitioner
filed
under
1442
(a)
by
a
federal
officer,
asserting
i
am
a
federal
officer
and
the
answer
was,
“you're
not
a
federal
officer,
you're
a
law
professor”,
i
would
expect
that
the
federal
district
court
would
try
that
issue.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
there's
no
question
that
if
the
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
in
this
case?
oh,
then
what
happens
in
the
federal
court?
a
hearing
has
to
be
held
on
the
specific
question
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh
no.
no
jury
trial.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
question
is
a
jurisdictional
one.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
because
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
court
shall
accept
jurisdiction
over
the
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
let
me
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
even
if
this
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
differ
from
the
government.
we
take
a
somewhat
narrower
view
of
the
right
of
removal
and
therefore
we
end
up
with
a
somewhat
different
view
on
what
happens
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
exactly
and
let
me
explain
why
that's
so.
if
this
case
were
tried
in
the
state
court,
i
believe
that
the
state
judge
not
the
jury
would
have
to
decide
the
hamm
and
lupper
issue.
mr.
justice
clark
asked
whether
or
not
--
that
would
be
tried
on
an
issue
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
believe
that
if
a
motion
to
abate
were
filed
citing
hamm
and
lupper
in
a
state
court
that
for
the
same
reason
that
under
jackson
and
denno,
a
state
judge
is
required
to
try
the
federal
constitutional
issue
of
a
confession
at
the
federal
--
that
a
state
trial
judge
would
be
required
to
try
without
a
jury
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
facts
brought
this
case
within
hamm
and
lupper.
i
think
that
then
a
jury
trial
would
have
to
be
held
on
whether
or
not
a
state
statute
had
been
violated
and
i
point
out
that
in
the
event
that
this
case
came
to
conviction
in
a
state
court
and
was
affirmed
on
appeal
that
when
a
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
was
filed
after
state
trial,
a
federal
district
judge
sitting
without
jury
would
decide
all
over
again
if
the
case
had
not
been
removed
and
advanced
at
trial
whether
or
not
the
petitioner's
conduct
fell
within
the
state
statute
and
whether
or
not
it
fall
within
the
protection
of
hamm
and
lupper.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
let
me
--
mr.
justice
white,
if
i
may,
this
issue
seems
to
me
critical,
i
mean,
the
entire
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--
construction
of
the
removal
statute.
the
question
of
--
as
soon
as
mr.
sparks
put
the
scope
of
hamm
and
lupper,
is
a
question
of
the
existence
of
hamm
and
lupper
because
--
let
me
explain
why.
we
think
congress
made
the
judgment
that
these
cases
should
be
tried
to
a
federal
judge
in
a
federal
court
at
the
outset.
if
this
case
is
now
decided
against
removal,
let
me
hypothesis
for
a
moment
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
(inaudible)
--
the
respondents
in
this
court
remove
a
petitioner
in
this
case,
thomas
rachel
comes
to
me
and
says
to
me,
“i'd
like
to
sit-in
in
one
of
the
few
remaining
segregated
restaurants
in
atlanta
or
the
many
remaining
segregated
restaurants
outside
atlanta,
can
i
do
it?”
what
would
i
have
to
tell
him?
i
would
have
to
tell
him,
“of
course
you
can
do
it."
if
the
restaurant
is
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
congress
has
said
in
so
many
words,
"you
have
a
right
of
equal
access
in
the
restaurant.”
and
congress
has
gone
out
of
his
way
to
say
that
not
only
have
you
got
that
but
no
person
shall
intimidate,
threaten,
coerce,
attempt
to
intimidate,
threaten
or
coerce
you
for
exercising
it,
you
shall
not
be
punished,
no
person
shall
attempt
to
punish
you.
and
then
i
would
--
would
be
i
think,
a
pretty
bad
lawyer
if
i
stop
there
because
what
i
ought
to
tell
him
is
that
if
the
restaurateur
wanted
to
deny
him
service,
he
wouldn't
do
it
on
the
ground
that
the
restaurant
wasn't
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
anymore.
he
would
do
it
precisely
on
the
ground
that
there
was
some
boisterousness
or
he
would
deny
it
on
the
ground
that
rachel
when
he
came
in
was
ill-dressed
or
that
he
was
drunk,
whether
he
ogled
the
waitress
or
anyone
of
a
whole
host
of
other
grounds
which
might
give
the
restaurateur
under
the
georgia
statute
a
right
to
exclude
it.
now
on
that
question
of
fact
depends
the
effective
enforcement
of
this
court's
hamm
and
lupper
decisions
and
the
effective
enforcement
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
and
we
suppose
that
a
federal
district
court
was
deemed
by
congress
to
be
a
better
form,
a
more
appropriate
form
for
the
trial
of
this
federal
issue
than
a
state
judge
or
state
jury.
if
i
had
to
tell
thomas
rachel
in
my
hypothetical
case,
what
he
could
expect
in
the
event
that
the
restaurateur
denied
him
service
on
the
ground
that
he
was
boisterous
or
annoys
the
--
or
ogled
the
waitress,
i
would
tell
him
that
what
would
happen
is
that
he
would
go
trial
and
this
mr.
justice
fortas,
goes
back
to
the
question
of
what
in
fact
happens
in
the
state
court
but
not
a
particular
state
court.
state
courts
generally,
i
would
tell
him
that
the
risk
that
he
runs
when
he
is
arrested
is
that
bail
will
set
--
be
set
when
as
--
it
was
for
one
of
the
removal
petitioners
in
this
case,
at
$7000
for
misdemeanor.
now,
it
may
well
be
that
we
can
challenge
that,
we
can
bring
other
proceedings,
habeas
corpus
in
a
state
court
or
up
to
the
state
highest
court
go
into
a
federal
district
court
to
challenge
bail
perhaps.
in
the
amount
of
time
that
it
takes
us
to
get
a
judge,
you
may
have
spent
a
night
or
you
may
have
spent
two
nights
in
jail
but
we
can
eventually
challenge
it
and
perhaps
we
have
to
go
through
several
courts
to
challenge
it.
then
what
will
happen
to
you
is
that
you'll
be
brought
to
trial
in
a
state
court.
the
state
court
will
be
sitting
right
across
ordinarily
from
the
chief
of
police
office
with
the
officers
wondering
in
and
out
of
the
courtroom.
and
how
your
witnesses
will
testify
and
how
the
ordinary
southern
lawyer
will
try
your
case
defending
you
is
going
to
be
very,
very
effectively
influenced
by
the
fact
that
the
courtroom
is
right
across
from
the
chief
of
police,
right
across
from
the
mayor's
office.
and
that
the
court
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
general
attitude
with
respect
to
defense
lawyers
is
--
and
of
all
lawyers
and
rightfully
is
of
great
deference
to
the
court.
and
where
the
suspicion
is
that
the
court
is
hostile
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
more
than
a
presumption.
it
is
a
conclusive
presumption
of
the
law.
it
just
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
it
is.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
intend
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
intend
to
get
just
there
and
when
i
spoke
of
history,
it
was
exactly
in
that
sense
that
i
meant
that
history
was
illuminating
and
indeed
we
think
controlling
in
this
case.
i
was
merely
pointing
out
why
congress
could've
made
the
judgment
that
we
think
it
may.
now,
to
establish
that
it
did
make
the
judgment,
we
have
gone
through
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
which
passed
a
hundred
years
ago
this
month,
laid
the
foundation
for
removal
jurisdiction
claimed
in
this
case.
i
ought
to
say
that
in
connection
with
the
legislative
history,
we
do
not
claim
any
more
than
we
do
with
respect
to
the
language
that
there's
anything
in
there
specifically
which
compels
this
court
to
the
result
we
contend
for.
in
the
sense
of
any
explanation
of
the
statute
on
the
floor
of
congress
or
any
supposition
of
the
cases
that
would
arise
under
it,
the
judiciary
provisions
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
were
relatively
undiscussed.
the
structure
of
the
original
statute
was
to
create
original
jurisdiction
as
well
as
removal
jurisdiction.
the
only
discussion
of
the
provision
at
all
was
by
senator
trumbull,
responsive
to
a
criticism
by
president
johnson
and
his
veto
because
the
criticism
was
slanted,
that
only
part
of
the
jurisdiction,
the
response
was
only
partial
and
we
find
no
illumination
in
the
specific
legislative
history
but
we
find
the
extraordinary
illumination
in
a
larger
panorama
of
history
here
because
we
think
that
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
the
history
of
use
of
the
federal
judiciary
to
enforce
federal
rights
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
particular
instance.
you
find
that
the
reconstruction
period,
the
period
in
which
the
statute
was
enacted
is
the
watershed
that
prior
to
the
reconstruction
period,
the
federal
courts
albeit
the
constitution,
gave
the
congress
power
to
establish
lower
federal
courts.
lower
federal
courts
were
very
seldom
used.
it
wasn't
even
a
general
federal
question
jurisdiction
as
we
know
it
today.
and
a
massive
business,
above
the
business
which
the
federal
courts
do
today,
they
were
giving
in
the
five
or
six
years
following
the
civil
war.
now,
the
second
thing
that
i
think
stands
out
is
one
that
looks
back
at
the
historical
panorama
is
that
the
principle
concern
of
the
reconstruction
congress
is
which
bulked
up
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
and
gave
them
the
protected
jurisdiction
which
they
have
today
was
with
the
pretention
of
the
civil
rights
which
were
gained
by
the
war,
secured
and
assured
by
--
substantively
by
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
and
by
the
civil
rights
act.
every
civil
rights
act,
everyone
had
jurisdictional
provisions
which
gave
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction.
now,
let's
take
a
look
for
one
moment
what
that
jurisdiction
is.
to
start
with,
in
cases
without
regard
to
a
mail
unlike
general
federal
questions
jurisdiction,
the
federal
courts
have
civil
jurisdiction
in
all
cases
involving
civil
rights.
they
have
it
originally.
they
have
it
in
equity.
they
have
it
in
law.
they
have
the
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
given
by
a
statute
in
1867
whose
clear
purpose
was
to
allow
them
to
take
from
state
custody,
persons
in
restraint
by
the
state
executive
with
or
without
state
judicial
process
where
their
federal
rights
were
being
violated.
the
federal
courts,
in
short,
have
very
extensive
civil
rights
jurisdiction.
now
a
question
arises,
did
not
congress
--
would
not
congress
have
foreseen
that
the
major
threat
perhaps
to
the
civil
rights
just
secured
by
the
war
and
by
the
amendments
would
not
come
in
civil
cases.
it
would
not
come
solely
in
cases
in
which
the
state
executive
was
acting
but
was
very
often
come
in
criminal
prosecutions
by
the
state
in
which
the
freedmen
and
the
unions
is
in
itself
were
prosecuted
and
we
know
congress
knew
this
because
the
debates
which
we've
set
out
at
pages
45
to
66
of
this
brief,
if
they
mean
anything,
mean
that
congress
knew
that
the
state
courts
were
hostile
and
that
state
court
actions
were
being
used
to
harass
unionists
and
negroes
in
the
south.
we
asked,
wouldn't
congress
have
done
something
about
that
and
we
conclude
that
they
did.
we
look
at
the
first
thing
they
did
in
reconstruction,
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
and
that
first
thing
they
did,
allows
removal
of
civil
and
criminal
cases
in
three
basic
categories.
the
only
one
of
them
and
the
third
is
in
issue
here
but
the
other
two
we
think
are
very
illuminating.
first
of
all,
federal
officers
enforcing
civil
rights
laws,
whatever
else
section
1443
(2)
means,
it
certainly
means
and
everybody
agrees
that
a
federal
officer
or
unionist
who
is
enforcing
the
civil
rights
act
could
remove
under
it.
he
wouldn't
have
to
show
case
by
case
that
the
state
courts
were
unfair.
he
wouldn't
have
to
show
that
the
state
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
the
very
fact
that
he
was
a
federal
officer
involved
in
civil
rights
enforcement
would
allow
them
to
remove.
secondly,
and
i
think
this
is
extremely
important
although
we
don't
rely
on
it
specifically
in
this
case.
a
state
officer
who
refused
to
do
an
act
on
the
ground
that
it
will
be
inconsistent
with
civil
rights
law
is
permitted
to
remove.
a
state
officer,
he
is
not
a
person
protected
by
federal
law,
he
is
permitted
to
remove
this
case
to
a
federal
court
simply
because
the
issue
of
his
authority
which
he
refuses
to
exercise
involves
federal
civil
rights
law.
he
doesn't
have
to
show
that
the
state
courts
are
not
fair.
he
does
not
have
to
show
that
they
will
not
sustain
the
federal
constitution.
he
does
not
have
to
show
that
there
is
a
state
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
all
that
he
has
to
show
is
that
he
is
a
state
officer,
being
prosecuted
for
an
act
or
a
failure
to
act
in
this
case
which
he
says
would
conflict
with
federal
law.
we
asked
then
if
these
two
classes
of
persons,
federal
officers
enforcing
the
law
and
state
officers
who
refuse
to
violate
it
or
for
that
reason
alone,
given
the
right
to
come
into
the
federal
courts.
did
not
congress
mean
or
would
it
not
also
have
meant
to
allow
the
very
persons
protected
by
the
amendment
and
by
the
federal
civil
rights
act
persons
who
were
denied
their
right
in
a
state
court
to
come
into
the
federal
court
on
that
ground
alone.
we
believe
that's
exactly
what
they
meant
with
section
1443
(2).
now,
let
me
very
carefully
distinguish
two
kinds
of
cases
because
usually
we
get
into
the
rives
line
as
well.
we
think
that
congress
was
thinking
about
two
situations.
first
is
a
situation
in
which
a
state
charge
is
brought
against
someone
for
conduct
in
the
exercise
of
a
federal
civil
right.
now
to
take
one
of
the
civil
rights
of
section
1
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866,
we'll
take
the
right
to
possess
property.
suppose
that
a
negro
got
a
grant
in
fee
of
a
piece
of
property
and
a
white
man
came
and
tried
to
throw
him
of
it,
tried
to
evict
him
forcibly
on
the
ground
that
he
couldn't
hold
property
and
that
the
white
man
was
entitled
to
the
property.
ordinary
state
law
would
allow
defense
by
force
of
one's
habitation
against
an
aggressor.
we
have
no
doubt
that
that
right
of
self-defense
was
protected
by
section
1
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
we
think
that
in
cases
like
that,
congress
made
the
conclusive
presumption
of
law
that
because
federal
civil
rights
were
involved
in
this
case
and
because
the
potential
for
harassment
of
granting
these
cases
through
the
state
courts
intermittently,
the
problems
i
raised
earlier,
trying
them
in
front
of
a
potentially
hostile
state
judge
who
will
influence
what
lawyers
do
by
his
very
presence,
who
will
influence
the
way
witnesses
testified,
who
has
enormous
discretion
on
questions
of
bail,
who
has
enormous
discretion
on
questions
of
timing
and
when
the
case
comes
before
the
court,
how
long
it
shall
be
held
up.
these
cases
are
cases
in
which
we
think
congress
meant
the
case
immediately
to
go
into
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
of
course.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
and
under
our
construction
of
the
statute,
it
is
to
be
made
by
a
federal
judge
after
a
removal
petition
has
been
filed
and
in
the
event
that
a
remand
motion
challenging
the
factual
allegations
of
the
petition
is
filed.
we
completely
agree
--
and
this
i
think
is
also
the
answer
in
part
to
why
i
earlier
responded
mr.
justice
white
as
i
did,
that
the
factual
question
is
critical.
but
we
think
congress
meant
precisely
because
of
the
power
of
a
state
court
to
find
the
facts
against
a
federal
petitioner
and
because
of
the
inconvenience
of
litigating
those
issues
in
the
state
court
and
the
threat
to
federal
rights
if
they
--
one
who
goes
out
to
sit
in
a
restaurant
knows
that
he's
going
to
go
to
trial
in
a
state
court.
we
think
that
the
how,
when
and
where
is
in
a
federal
court
on
a
motion
to
remand
in
advance
of
any
trial.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
and
by
a
judge
without
a
jury.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
remand
to
the
state
court
where
a
trial
by
jury
has
had
and
this
is
not,
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
this
i
understand
--
i
understand
this
to
be
the
government's
position
in
peacock.
that
what
the
government
says
is
that
--
and
verbally,
i
think
there's
very
good
basis
for
this.
the
government
seems
to
say
that
the
--
particularly
under
subsection
(2)
that
the
question
of
color
of
authority
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i'm
sure
that's
right.
that
wherever
the
case
is
within
--
as
it
were,
shooting
distance
of
the
constitution,
the
whole
case
comes
over
into
the
federal
courts
and
you
try
it
there.
constitutional
defenses,
federal
defenses
and
the
state
law
question
all
at
once.
we
don't
think
that
that
is
what
congress
meant.
now,
we
would
be
delighted
to
have
that
kind
of
an
expansive
reading
of
the
statute.
we
don't
ask
for
it.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
i
think
that
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
i
think
that
the
only
objection
that
i
have
to
characterizing
as
narrow
or
limited
to
our
case,
the
government's
contention
is
that
it
would
also
apply
beyond
sit-ins
to
demonstration
cases
generally.
as
i
understand
the
government,
it
takes
the
position
that
judge
friendly
assumed
in
galamison
that
if
the
conduct
is
colorably
protected
by
federal
law
then
trial
is
had
on
the
merits
in
a
federal
court
to
a
jury.
now,
i
understand
the
government's
desire
for
that.
it
comes
from
two
things
as
i
understand
it,
one,
a
feeling
that
efficiency
is
served
if
a
single
trial
was
had
instead
of
two
trials.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
we
don't
disagree
with
that
but
we
do
disagree
with
some
of
the
factual
assumptions
that
underlie
it.
and
we
also
think
that
there
are
countervailing
considerations
to
efficiency,
one
of
which
is
that
under
our
construction
of
the
statute,
we
can
honestly
say
that
no
cases
taken
out
of
the
state
court,
in
no
cases
the
state
court
deprive
the
power
to
proceed
except
the
cases
shouldn't
be
there
in
the
first
place.
that's
the
virtue
i
think
of
our
construction
of
the
removal
statute.
the
government's
construction
of
the
removal
statute
allows
the
federal
mechanism
to
come
in
to
operation
even
in
cases
which
can
proceed
the
judgment.
ours
is
very
limited.
we
think
that
the
optimal
balance
to
be
struck
between
the
use
of
the
federal
courts
to
protect
federal
rights
and
the
necessity
that
state
courts
go
on
and
on
impede
it
in
cases
where
federal
rights
are
not
being
denied
simply
calls
for
trying
whether
or
not
federal
protection
does
by
the
prosecution
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
is
exactly
so
and
that
brings
me
to
the
gov
--
to
what
i
think
is
the
second
consideration
that
informs
the
government's
point
because
certainly
in
terms
of
efficiency
you
can't
quarrel
the
efficiency
of
that.
and
if
one
wants
to
talk
about
efficiency,
you
can
compare
what
happened
in
southern
alabama,
for
example,
with
the
various
other
large
demonstration
episodes
that
have
happened
all
over
the
country.
within
three
months,
the
southern
alabama
demonstrations
and
the
3,000
prosecutions
arising
out
of
them
were
finished,
terminated,
ended.
a
federal
district
judge
on
a
motion
to
remand
in
a
removed
case
found
that
all
of
those
prosecutions
were
unfounded,
that
is
to
say,
that
the
conduct
from
which
they
were
--
on
which
they
were
based
was
protected
by
the
federal
constitution
and
washed
all
of
those
cases
out
properly.
had
it
not
been
for
that,
the
cases
would
still
be
in
the
middle
of
trial
and
appeal
and
we
would
have
what
we
had
in
mississippi
freedom
writer
case,
another
case
to
six
years
to
the
vindication
of
right.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
is
exactly
that
and
there
is
nothing
anomalous
about
it
because
we
think
that
even
if
this
case
were
tried
in
the
state
courts,
as
i
said
earlier,
that
the
issue
of
federal
defense
as
distinguished
from
the
issue
of
guilt
would
have
to
be
tried
by
the
judge
and
not
the
jury.
we
do
not
think
that
federal
constitutional
defenses
even
in
a
state
court
or
jury
issues.
now
the
trial
judge,
just
to
make
very
specific
what
i
mean,
a
trial
judge
to
whom
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
submitted
either
just
before
verdict
or
just
after
verdict.
in
a
case
like
edwards
and
south
carolina
for
example,
would
have
to
decide
himself
whether
or
not
the
facts
as
testified
to
by
the
police
officers
on
the
one
side
and
the
demonstrators
on
the
other,
showed
federal
constitutional
protection.
now,
he
could
say
to
counsel,
“counsel,
i
--
i'm
willing
to
go
with
what
12
good
men
(inaudible)
say.”
and
treat
that
that's
an
advisory
verdict.
they
have
to
decide
the
issue
of
guilt
as
to
whether
or
not
these
people
were
obstructing
the
street
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
that's
the
same
fact
question,
is
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
on
federal
habeas
corpus
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
--
or
do
you
mean
a
trial?
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
that
it
can
be
raised
in
the
state
court
and
we
have
that
position
exactly
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
sure.
no
question
about
that.
we
have
that
today
exactly
in
a
two
trial
system.
we
have
a
post
conviction
federal
habeas
corpus.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
state
--
the
facts
established
in
the
state
court
may
not
be
the
same
as
those
established
in
a
federal
court.
and
if
the
state
court
wrongly
applies
federal
law
with
the
facts
found
in
the
state
court
that
would
be
a
federal
constitutional
violation
just
as
it
is
today.
this
court
can
reverse
as
it
did
in
edwards
and
south
carolina,
a
state
court
proceeding
in
which
on
the
facts
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
that
raises
a
difficult
question.
ordinarily
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
ordinarily
there
can
only
be
one
removal
petition.
the
reason
i
boggled
with
that
was
simply
that
in
this
case,
and
this
is
one
of
the
issues
that
i
think
is
pertinent
to
whether
or
not
we're
properly
up
here
on
appeal.
i
think
that
we
could
if
we
were
now
sent
back
on
the
procedural
ground
that
the
appeal
wasn't
timely
filed
--
filed
a
new
one
because
the
first
one
was
filed
as
we
pointed
out
before
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
i
have
one
--
before
we
had
any
ground
of
the
sort
that
we
now
seek
to
sustain
removal
on
for
removing
and
i
think
that
the
first
opportunity
that
we
have
to
raise
the
substantive
claims
here
we
could
raise
them
again.
but
ordinarily,
only
one
petition
could
be
filed.
i
don't
think
that
is
inconsistent
at
all
with
the
position
that,
if
the
case
were
remanded
for
the
state
court,
trial
should
be
had
on
the
facts
of
the
federal
constitutional
issue.
again,
today,
federal
habeas
corpus
will
lie
in
order
to
give
every
litigant
having
a
federal
claim
one
chance
to
try
his
federal
issue
before
a
federal
judge.
that
doesn't
mean
two
chances.
it
doesn't
mean
that
because
one
federal
habeas
corpus
petition
can
be
filed
that
two
can
be
or
that
three
can
be.
it
only
means
that
he
has
a
right
to
have
a
federal
court
find
the
facts.
but
he
also
has
a
right
to
have
a
state
court
apply
federal
law
right
on
the
facts
found
in
a
state
proceeding.
so,
i
do
not
believe
that
if
a
federal
court
remands
after
finding
that
there's
no
constitutional
protection
that
he
is
deprived
of
the
opportunity
of
raising
the
federal
issue.
new
facts
may
turn
up
at
the
hearing
in
the
state
court.
it
may
well
be
that
the
state
officer
testify
somewhat
differently
than
he
did
at
the
federal
court.
and
at
that
point,
he
has
a
right
to
say
to
the
state
judge
on
a
testimony
which
you've
jus
heard
your
honor,
the
federal
constitution
has
been
violated
in
this
case
and
we
invoke
it.
and
we
think
that
the
state
court
is
obligated
to
entertain
that
federal
constitutional
defense.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
let
me
answer
that
by
specific
reference
but
i
ought
to
say
one
thing
before
i
do.
mr.
justice
fortas
asked
earlier
whether
or
not
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
right.
the
allegation
in
page
2
of
the
removal
petition
and
this
is
exemplary.
this
is
the
one
group
of
petitioners
but
its
exemplary
as
to
the
others
is
that
the
petitioner
sought
to
obtain
service,
food,
entertainment
and
comfort
at
leb's
restaurant,
a
restaurant
open
to
the
general
public,
66
luckie
street,
atlanta,
georgia.
the
further
allegation
is
that
they
were
arrested
on
this
occasion
for
the
sole
purpose,
and
this
is
on
page
1,
of
aiding,
abetting
and
perpetuating
customs
and
usages
having
historical
and
psychological
roots
with
respect
to
serving
in
sitting
members
of
the
negro
race
in
places
of
public
accommodation
and
convenience
on
a
racially
discriminatory
basis
and
upon
terms
and
conditions
not
imposed
on
members
of
the
so-called
white
or
caucasian
race.
it
is
further
alleged
on
page
4
of
the
record
conclusorally
that
the
petitioners
are
being
prosecuted
for
acts
on
under
color
of
authority
derived
from
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
now
that
is
a
characterization
of
the
earlier
allegations,
which
is
that
having
entered
restaurants
with
described
addresses
and
restaurants
which
it
is
alleged
were
open
to
the
public.
they
were
refused
service
in
a
racially
discriminatory
basis.
now,
we
have
no
doubt
that
looked
at
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
this
is
a
sufficient
allegation,
although
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
no.
they
are
--
one
couldn't
make
more
specific
allegations
of
fact
on
two
issues.
as
we
understand
it,
there
are
three
issues
which
have
to
be
shown
to
demonstrate
hamm
and
--
that
hamm
and
lupper
applies.
one,
that
there
is
a
restaurant
involved.
two,
that
it's
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
and
three,
that
service
was
refused
on
racial
grounds.
the
allegation
that
it's
a
restaurant,
leb's,
a
privately
owned
restaurant
open
to
the
general
public,
66
luckie
street,
it's
impossible
to
allege
that
in
greater
factual
detail.
the
allegation
that
service
was
refused
on
grounds
of
racial
discrimination
is
the
allegation
that
these
people
were
--
they
were
seeking
service,
they
were
arrested
for
doing
so
pursuant
to
a
deep
ceded
custom
etcetera
of
racial
discrimination
and
public
service.
again,
you
could
not
allege
more
--
in
more
detail
as
a
matter
of
fact.
now,
the
only
question
and
this
is
the
only
one
on
which
the
petition
is
deficient
is
in
specifically
alleging
coverage
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
i
think
that's
a
paper
issue
because
i
don't
think
that
in
this
court,
georgia
has
--
i
don't
think
it
could,
i
don't
think
it
will
state
that
leb's
or
davis
house
number
three
in
the
heart
of
atlanta,
georgia
are
not
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
but
we
think
that
even
if
they
did,
the
factual
allegations
are
quite
sufficient.
the
factual
allegation
is
66
luckie
street.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
a
court
sitting
in
a
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh,
yes.
and
right
after
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
hamm
and
lupper
have
already
bridged
them
we
think,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
if
hamm
and
lupper
protected
prosecutions
on
the
theory
as
i
understand
it's
a
basis
of
your
honor's
question
that
once
a
1964
act
was
passed,
from
that
point
on
it
constituted
a
punishment
or
harassment
under
203
to
continue
with
those
prosecution.
but
that
it
did
not
necessarily
invalidate
a
state
arrest
prior
to
that.
i
would
go
along
with
your
honor
on
that.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
completely
agree.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
right.
i
have
no
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
have
no
complaint
with
that
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
i
may
add,
well,
i
put
my
stress
on
the
notion
that
they
were
denied
their
rights
by
the
arrest
then
that
they
cannot
enforce
them
in
a
state
proceeding
which
his
now
existing.
but
what
we
have
here
is
a
proceeding
in
which
on
july
2nd,
1964,
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
act
was
pending.
at
that
point,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
became
applicable.
the
federal
court
which
had
the
cases
at
that
time
was
authorized
to
remand
the
proceedings
or
to
entertain
jurisdiction.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well,
let
me
see
if
this
is
a
satisfactory
way
of
doing
it
because
this
seems
to
me
--
of
course
we
point,
necessarily
needs
follow.
the
complaint
we
make
of
the
state
prosecution
in
this
case
is
that
it
itself
constitutes
not
the
arrest
but
the
prosecution
constitutes
an
intimidation,
threat,
coercion,
a
punishment
or
an
attempt
to
punish,
the
language
relied
on
in
hamm
and
lupper,
these
three
civil
rights
act
of
1964
demonstrations,
sit-ins.
now,
we
say
that
as
of
july
2nd,
1964,
it
became
impermissible
for
the
state
to
maintain
prosecutions
whose
effect
was
to
harass,
intimidate,
coerce,
punish
persons
for
the
exercise
of
the
right
or
for
seeking
--
i
won't
put
it
in
terms
of
exercise
of
a
right,
there
wasn't
a
right
then.
but
the
statute
said
and
this
court
held
in
hamm
and
lupper
that
a
state
could
not
now
punish
pre-act
conduct
which
was
simply
sitting
in
a
restaurant
seeking
service.
we
think
that
at
that
point,
a
federal
court
which
has
the
case
is
called
upon
just
as
this
court
called
on
all
state
courts
which
had
such
cases
in
hamm
and
lupper
to
look
at
the
case
before
it
and
decide
whether
or
not
the
case
is
indeed
a
punishment,
harassment,
etcetera.
if
it
is,
we
believe
that
that
in
itself
falls
into
effect
the
removal
statute
which
is
intended
to
give
federal
jurisdiction
to
decide
just
such
a
question.
now
we
do
not
for
that
purpose
have
to
rely
on
the
principle
that
the
arrest
were
illegal
at
the
time
made
although
if
necessary,
we
adhere
to
arguments
previously
made
in
this
court
prior
to
hamm
and
lupper
which
we
think
the
court
need
not
made
--
need
not
reach
that
the
constitution
protected
the
conduct
alleged
in
this
case
whether
--
well,
as
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
if
there
is
indeed
--
if
the
court
should
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
does
not
bar
the
prosecution
as
in
this
case
or
is
not
invocable
as
a
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction
then
we
indeed
have
a
question
here
that
we
have
in
the
peacock
case.
except
that
we
have
in
additional
substantive
question,
the
one
left
open
in
bell
and
other
cases
to
whether
or
not
the
conduct
here
alleged
is
indeed
protected
by
the
constitution.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
i
don't
purport
to
speak
with
authority
in
what
was
in
fact
done
in
watts.
my
recollection
is
that
no
attempt
was
made
to
remove
any
of
those
cases
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes,
there
has
indeed
been.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
galamison
opinion
in
the
second
circuit
effectively
barred
removal
of
cases
under
the
various
theories
put
forth
in
the
present
cases
in
the
second
circuit.
however,
there
have
subsequently
been
attempts
to
remove
and
in
the
hutchinson
case,
for
example,
and
others,
stays
have
been
given
and
there
are
cases
pending
in
the
second
circuit,
yes.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
it
certainly
does
and
it's
quite
unlike
in
that
regard
the
amendatory
freedmen's
bureau
act
which
gave
fed
--
general
federal
jurisdiction
in
military
tribunals
but
only
in
the
south.
this
one
was
intended
to
be
forever
and
it
was
intended
to
be
in
all
the
states
forever
and
our
argument
doesn't
rest
as
i
say,
on
this
court's
finding
or
any
federal
district
court's
finding
that
the
superior
court
of
fulton
county,
georgia
is
unfair
or
biased,
whether
the
--
in
the
state
courts
in
mississippi
are
unfair,
biased,
the
state
courts
throughout
the
south
are
unfair
and
biased.
we
claim
that
congress
has
made
the
judgment
about
state
courts
generally
that
just
as
in
diversity
cases.
just
as
in
federal
question
cases,
the
rights
of
a
federal
claimant
need
a
federal
judge
to
protect
them
and
that
from
the
outset
that
in
cases
involving
civil
rights,
criminal
cases
in
which
civil
rights
defenses
are
presented
and
can
be
sustained
on
the
facts
in
front
of
the
federal
judge
the
case
should
be
tried
in
front
of
a
federal
judge
and
not
in
front
of
a
state
judge
in
new
york,
in
california
or
in
fulton
county,
georgia.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
my
argument
doesn't
begin
to
go
to
that
question
because
the
only
case
in
which
i
seek
to
sustain
removal
jurisdiction
is
a
case
in
which
the
affidavit,
the
verified
removal
petition
asserts
not
that
he
is
being
prejudiced
on
account
of
color
or
that
the
jury
is
prejudiced
to
the
judge's
prejudice.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
no.
that
--
our
argument
would
not
allow
removal
in
those
cases.
our
argument
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
oh!
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
justice
black,
that
is
absolutely
true
but
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
my
argument
or
how
this
court
decides
this
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
yes.
but
you
see,
congress
has
provided
that
if
a
removal
petition
is
filed,
the
state
court
proceeding
stops.
now
no
matter
what
you
say
about
the
scope
of
the
removal
jurisdiction
or
where
he
can
always
file
that
paper,
if
he's
going
to
be
dishonest.
i
think
the
only
way
in
which
this
court
can
protect
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
way
in
which
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
well
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
the
real
risk
it
--
the
risk
it
seems
to
me
of
interruption
of
state
court
process
that
flows
from
the
removal
jurisdiction
is
two
separate
risks.
one,
that
the
removal
jurisdiction
will
be
in
fact
broader
than
it
ought
to
be
and
the
cases
which
should
not
be
brought
into
the
federal
court
will
be
brought
there
and
will
stay
there.
the
second
one
is
the
risk
that
the
jurisdiction
will
be
abused
because
counsel
will
file
frivolous
papers.
it
will
take
it
into
the
federal
court.
in
your
hypothetical
case
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
not
sustain
removal
and
so
the
first
court
will
--
the
first
question
whether
or
not
the
federal
courts
have
taken
jurisdiction
announced
to
the
state
court
in
a
case
in
which
they
should
not
is
not
in
the
case.
and
the
second
one
in
which
counsel
are
filing
wrongly
that
maybe
either
because
of
a
mistake
of
law
or
because
they're
abusing
the
process.
a
clear
decision
by
this
court
is
to
the
scope
of
1443
will
end
i
think
such
mistakes
of
law.
as
per
abuse
by
counsel,
that
is
inherent
or
its
potentiality
is
inherent
whether
you
stick
with
the
reason
that
was
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
but
they're
not
removable
under
our
theory.
our
theory
allows
removal
only
where
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
our
theory
of
removal
would
not
authorize
removal
in
that
case.
mr.
anthony
g.
amsterdam
exactly.
that's
