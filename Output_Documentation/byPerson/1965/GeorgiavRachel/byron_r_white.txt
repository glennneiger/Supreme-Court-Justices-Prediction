justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
your
case
is
really
like
peacock?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
all
that's
involved
--
all
that's
involved
in
your
case
is
--
in
your
case,
a
question
of
--
the
way
the
case
was
decided
anyway
was
of
--
whether
or
not
a
prosecution
for
conduct
that
is
expressly
permitted
by
federal
law
may
be
removed?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
law
was
aimed
at
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
law
was
aimed
at
giving
equal
rights
from
public
accommodation.
that's
the
federal
law
that's
involved
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
get
back
to
your
statement
with
that
--
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that's
the
--
that
on
the
outcome
of
this
case
depends
hundreds
of
other
cases
in
the
federal
court.
now,
how
many
states
are
going
to
prosecute
for
entering
a
restaurant
and
securing
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
a
hundreds
of
cases
like
this
around
the
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
--
why
would
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
counsel
tell
me,
why
would
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
a
prosecution
in
a
state
court
still
be
pending
if
it
relates
to
entering
a
restaurant
and
asking
for
service,
conduct
which
is
covered
by
the
federal
law
and
which
under
hamm
and
lupper
the
case
should
--
shouldn't
get
off
the
ground.
now,
why
are
those
cases
still
pending?
are
there
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
certainly,
wouldn't
you
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
violence?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
really
--
there's
an
argument
over
the
scope
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
federal
district
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes.
they
should
be
about
--
but
do
you
think
the
trial
about
whether
or
not
the
federal
privilege
has
been
exceeded,
the
actual
trial,
that
controversy
should
take
place
in
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
--
and
if
on
a
--
if
a
motion
for
--
to
remand
is
just
simply
claimed
that
the
federal
privilege
has
been
exceeded,
there
should
be
a
remand
to
the
state
court
to
have
the
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
--
did
georgia
claim
in
this
case
that
the
conduct
it
involved
with
the
--
was
not
affected
by
the
public
accommodations
law?
is
there
any
claim
here
to
the
federal
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
to
the
extent
that
there
are
some
of
this
case
that
maybe
--
have
no
(inaudible)
because
there
may
be
no
claim
in
federal
(inaudible).
why
are
those
cases
still
on

justice
byron

white
and
i
suppose
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that
there's
plenty
of
them,
a
hundred
and
--
but
that
they
were
removed
before
hamm
and
lupper
ever
came
down.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
after
hamm
and
lupper,
there
are
50
of
them
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
just
--
just
the
georgia
courts
will
and
have
been
on
hamm
and
lupper
that
the
--
that
to
the
extent
they
will
be
dis
--
should
be
dismissed,
they
will
be
dismissed
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
all
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
they're
still
in
the
court
even
though
some
of
them
are
--
maybe
covered
by
hamm
and
lupper.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
--
including
the
right
protected
by
the
constitution
and
not
by
a
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
about
--
that
other
removal
statute
didn't
so
provide
until
1948,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
revenue
officers?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
we
understand
but
let's
all
assumes
that
there
--
had
been
a
prosecution
for
a
federally
protected
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
where
do
you
suggest
and
i
suppose
you
suggest
that
if
somebody
just
alleged
the
--
that
the
federal
right
is
being
prosecuted
in
the
state
court,
that
question
must
be
tried
out
in
the
--
an
initial
question
that
we
tried
out
in
the
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
a
--
that
there
is
a
petition
for
removal
is
filed
and
that
case
is
removed
and
the
motion
for
remand
says,
"yes,
but
these
people
were
being
violent
and
arrested."
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
happens
in
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
jury
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
aren't
the
facts
really
the
--
one
of
the
defenses
is
--
one
of
the
defenses
of
the
defendant
is
that
i'm
protected
by
a
federal
statute
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
you
agree
with
the
government
on
this
position
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
do
you
know
what
happens
in
the
federal
court
on
the
motion
for
remand?
do
you
think
you
have
the
same
position
as
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
consi
--
you
would
say
that
the
federal
--
the
judge
alone
could
have
that
hearing
and
make
those
factual
determinations
and
legal
conclusions
on
the
motion
to
remand?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
jury
would
decide
whether
there
was
violence.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
certainly
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
kind
of
a
case
you
have
in
rachel,
they
--
they're
talking
specifically
about
the
kind
of
case
you
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
think
they
talked
--
they
talk
(inaudible)
about
one
specific
kind
of
a
case,
not
your
kind
of
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
--
or
that
--
oh,
you're
trying
the
scope
of
--
perhaps
the,
of
the
federal
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
think
that
if
there's
been
a
denial
automatically
at
the
outset
of
--
that
the
judge
would
try
out
whether
or
not
a
--
for
example,
a
prosecutor
has
applied
the
trespass
statute
is
because
somebody
is
a
negro?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
--
are
you
saying
that
there's
never
going
to
be
--
under
your
construction,
you'll
never
have
a
criminal
trial
in
the
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you'll
never
have
a
guilty
or
not
guilty
verdict
in
the
federal
court.
it
will
always
be
either
--
it'll
either
be
dismissed,
the
case
will
be
dismissed
if
you
found
that
the
federal
right
has
been
violated
by
the
constitution
or
they'll
be
remanded
for
trial
in
a
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
it's
really
--
is
a
federal
habeas
corpus
before
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
mr.
amsterdam,
the
--
upon
the
--
if
the
federal
judge
himself
in
a
â€“
some
kind
of
a
hearing,
on
a
motion,
(inaudible)
these
facts
in
remand
and
the
appeal
is
taken,
occur
and
asserted
the
smith
view,
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
state
court
on
your
--
do
you
think
the
defense
could
be
raised
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
in
the
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
--
so
again,
even
though
the
federal
court
has
already
determined
the
fact.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
do
you
think
there
could
only
one
removal
petition?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know,
i
just
would
be
--
i
would
think
that
the
(inaudible)
consistent
with
your
position
is
that
it
could
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
--
aren't
you
--
up
here,
to
saying
that
when
the
conduct
--
when
the
conduct
for
which
the
defendant
is
being
prosecuted
in
the
state
court,
is
itself
permitted,
expressly
permitted
by
a
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
--
this
isn't
a
kind
of
a
case
where
you're
disclaiming
that
you
won't
get
a
fair
trial
or
that
he's
being
discriminated
against
as
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
conduct,
its
permitted
by
federal
law
is
now
being
prosecuted
in
a
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
your
case
is
really
like
peacock?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
all
that's
involved
--
all
that's
involved
in
your
case
is
--
in
your

a
question
of

the

the

was
decided

whether

the

white
and
the

was
aimed
at
giving

that's
the
federal

that's
involved
here.
justice
byron

white
well,
let's
get
back
to
your
statement
with
that
--
is
that
--
justice
byron

--
that's
the

that
on
the
outcome

depends
hundreds

either
be
dismissed,
the
case
will
be
dismissed
if
you
found
that
the
federal
right
has
been
violated
by
the
constitution
or
they'll
be
remanded
for
trial
in
a
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
it's
really
--
is
a
federal
habeas
corpus
before
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
mr.
amsterdam,
the
--
upon
the
--
if
the
federal
judge
himself
in
a
â€“
some
kind
of
a
hearing,
on
a
motion,
(inaudible)
these
facts
in
remand
and
the
appeal
is
taken,
occur
and
asserted
the
smith
view,
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
state
court
on
your
--
do
you
think
the
defense
could
be
raised
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
in
the
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i

but
--

even
though
the
federal
court
has
already
determined
the
fact.

white
well,

you
think
there
could

justice
byron
r.
white

i
know,
i
just
would
be
--
i
would
think
that
the
(inaudible)
consistent
with
your
position
is
that
it
could
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
--
aren't
you
--
up
here,
to
saying
that
when
the
conduct
--
when
the
conduct
for
which
the
defendant
is
being
prosecuted
in
the
state
court,
is
itself
permitted,
expressly
permitted
by
a
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
--
this
isn't
a
kind
of
a
case
where
you're
disclaiming
that
you
won't
get
a
fair
trial
or
that
he's
being
discriminated
against
as
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
conduct,
its
permitted
by
federal
law
is
now
being
prosecuted
in
a
state
court?
