mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
as
follows.
on
august
the
2nd,
1963,
a
grand
jury
of
fulton
county
superior
court
in
atlanta,
georgia
indicted
the
defendant,
thomas
rachel
and
19
other
defendants
in
separate
indictments
for
a
violation
of
the
georgia
law
making
it
a
misdemeanor
to
fail
and
refuse
to
leave
the
premises
of
another
after
having
been
requested
to
leave
by
the
person
in
charge
of
the
premises.
the
incident
for
which
the
defendants
were
indicted
occurred
on
the
17th
of
june
1963
when
the
defendant
attempting
to
be
seated
and
served
in
leb's
restaurant
in
atlanta,
georgia,
failed
and
refused
to
leave
the
restaurant
after
having
been
asked
to
do
so
by
the
manager
of
the
restaurant.
the
indictment
against
the
other
19
defendants
contained
identical
allegations
to
the
rachel
indictment
with
the
exception
that
in
some
instances,
the
misdemeanor
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed
on
another
date
and
at
a
different
restaurant.
on
february
the
17th,
1964,
the
defendant
rachel
and
the
other
19
defendants
filed
a
petition
for
removal
in
the
u.s.
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
under
the
authority
of
sections
1443
(1)
and
(2)
and
1446,
title
28
u.s.c.
the
petition
alleged
that
georgia
was
by
a
statute
perpetuating
customs
and
serving
members
of
the
negro
race
in
places
of
public
accommodation
on
a
racially
discriminatory
basis
and
on
terms
and
conditions
not
imposed
on
white
race.
also,
they
were
being
prosecuted
for
acts
done
under
color
of
authority
derived
from
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
and
for
refusing
to
do
an
act
inconsistent
therewith.
on
february
the
18th,
1964,
united
states
district
court
judge
boyd
sloan,
remanded
the
cases
to
fulton
county
superior
court
stating
that
the
petition
for
removal
failed
to
allege
sufficient
facts
for
removal
of
the
case
to
the
federal
court
system.
on
march
5th,
1964,
the
defendants
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
from
the
remand
order
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
and
on
the
12th
of
march,
the
state
of
georgia
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
and
the
defendants
filed
a
motion
to
stay
the
remand
order
pending
the
appeal
before
the
fifth
circuit.
on
that
day,
a
hearing
was
held
before
a
three-judge
panel
and
a
stay
was
granted
by
a
two
to
one
division
of
the
court.
on
the
5th
of
march
1965,
after
hearing
oral
argument,
the
court
of
appeals
by
a
divided
three-judge
panel
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
hold
a
hearing
and
to
dismiss
the
prosecution
if
it
established
that
the
removal
of
the
defendants
from
the
various
places
of
public
accommodation
was
done
for
racially
discriminatory
reasons.
a
timely
petition
was
filed
by
the
state
of
georgia
for
rehearing
en
banc
and
this
was
denied
on
april
19th,
1965
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
october
the
11th,
1965
on
three
grounds
with
which
we
are
concerned
here.
first,
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
appeal
because
the
notice
of
appeal
of
the
remand
order
was
filed
six
days
beyond
the
10-day
time
limit
required
by
rule
37
(a)
(2)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
secondly,
that
the
petition
for
removal
failed
to
allege
sufficient
facts
or
valid
ground
for
removing
state
prosecutions
to
the
federal
court,
and
third,
the
court
of
appeals
aired
in
directing
the
district
court
to
look
for
only
one
criteria
on
the
hearing
and
to
dismiss
the
state
court
prosecution
if
that
single
element
was
found.
that
element
of
course
is
that
the
arrest
and
removal
of
the
defendants
from
the
various
restaurants
in
atlanta,
georgia
was
done
because
of
race
discrimination.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i
would
like
to
limit
myself
only
to
the
first
consideration
that
being
the
rule
of
criminal
procedure
37
(a)
(2)
and
leave
the
latter
two
questions
to
mr.
sparks
my
co-counsel.
it
is
our
contention
that
rule
37
(a)
(2)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
apply
to
this
case
and
apply
to
all
appeals
from
criminal
prosecution
either
before
verdict
or
after
verdict.
by
act
of
february
24th,
1933,
as
amended,
this
court
was
given
the
authority
to
prescribe
rules
of
practice
and
procedure
after
verdict
finding
of
guilty
by
the
court
if
the
jury
was
waived
or
pleas
of
guilty.
on
may
7th,
1934
pursuant
to
the
above
act,
this
court
promulgated
13
rules
which
they
entitle
“rules
of
practice
and
proceedings”
after
plea
of
guilty,
verdict
of
guilty,
or
finding
of
guilty.
rule
3
of
this
rules
which
is
the
predecessor
to
rule
37
(a)
(2)
stated
that
an
appeal
must
be
taken
five
days
after
entry
of
judgment
of
conviction.
now,
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
language
entry
of
judgment
of
conviction
because
i
believe
that
by
the
use
of
this
language
and
by
the
title
of
the
13
rules,
it
is
clear
that
these
13
rules
apply
only
to
after
verdict
appeals.
by
act
of
june
29th,
1940,
congress
gave
the
court
authority
to
prescribe
rules
of
practice
in
the
criminal
cases
prior
to
and
including
verdict,
finding
of
guilty
or
not
guilty
by
the
court.
this
act
required
that
these
rules
should
be
reported
to
congress
before
they
became
effective.
and
pursuant
to
this
act,
this
court
have
promulgated
rules
1-31
and
40-60
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
by
order
dated
december
26,
1944.
these
rules
were
submitted
to
congress
and
became
effective
on
march
21st,
1946
as
provided
by
rule
59.
by
an
order
dated
february
the
8th,
1946,
the
court
prescribed
rules
32-39
pursuant
to
the
1933
enabling
act,
allowing
the
court
to
promulgate
rules
after
verdict
and
pleas
of
guilty.
the
court
made
these
rules
effective
on
the
same
date
that
they
made
rules
1-31
and
40-60
effective.
also,
by
this
order,
the
court
instructed
that
these
rules
be
titled
the
“federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure”
and
that
all
60
rules
should
be
consecutively
numbered.
i
think
that
it
is
clear
from
this
february
8,
1946
order
that
the
supreme
court
intended
that
rules
1-60
should
serve
as
a
complete
set
of
criminal
rules
of
procedure.
this
is
manifested
by
all
the
rules
becoming
effective
on
the
same
day
by
the
title
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
also
by
the
fact
that
the
court
had
them
numbered
consecutively.
also,
rule
1
of
the
federal
rule
state
the
scope
of
these
rules
and
that
is
that
they
are
to
govern
the
procedures
in
courts
of
the
united
states
in
all
criminal
procedures
except
as
listed
in
rule
54.
it
should
also
be
noted
that
rule
54
specifically
applies
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
to
remove
proceedings.
also,
rule
57
further
outlines
the
purpose
of
the
court
and
that
it
states
that
these
rules
shall
govern
all
criminal
proceedings
thereafter
commenced.
now,
i
believe
that
if
the
court
had
intended
to
separate
rules
32-39,
and
1-31,
and
40-60
into
two
separate
categories,
it
would
not
have
gone
to
the
trouble
of
numbering
the
rules
consecutively,
entitled
--
titling
them
as
they
did,
and
making
them
effective
on
the
same
day.
also,
it
seems
to
me
that
these
rules
were
prepared
by
an
advisotory
committee
appointed
by
the
supreme
court,
and
so,
we
cannot
say
that
this
is
a
case
where
the
left
hand
did
not
know
what
the
right
hand
was
doing.
the
court
would
have
been
explicit
in
separating
the
two
rules
if
they
were
to
retain
the
before
verdict
and
after
verdict
limitations.
now,
i
submit
if
the
distinction
ever
existed
as
to
the
applications
of
rules
32-39
to
limit
that
only
to
after
verdict
appeals,
that
this
has
been
rectified
by
the
enactment
of
title
18
of
united
states
code.
this
act
was
entitled
“an
act
to
revise
and
codify
and
enacted
into
positive
law
title
18
of
the
united
states
code”.
all
sixty
rules
of
criminal
procedure
are
embodied
within
this
title.
rule
37
(a)
(2)
specifically
incorporated
by
reference
in
section
37
and
32
of
that
title.
and
i
think
it's
clear,
as
i've
said
before,
by
the
title
of
the
rules,
by
them
being
numbered
consecutively,
and
by
them
being
enacted
to
take
effect
on
the
same
day
that
the
court
intended
that
these
rules
would
cover
all
criminal
proceedings.
and
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
title
18,
which
states
that
title
18
was
the
culmination
of
several
years
work
and
that
every
provision
has
been
brought
down
to
date,
and
the
laws
have
been
rearranged
and
the
language
modernized
and
simplified,
and
that
many
provisions
were
combined
and
overlapping
eliminated,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
revisers
undoubtedly
realize
what
the
purpose
of
the
supreme
court
and
the
intention
of
the
supreme
court
was
in
promulgating
rules
1-60.
and
i
think
that
the
enactment
of
title
18,
which
incorporates
the
entire
set
of
sixty
rules
of
federal
criminal
procedure,
is
an
acceptance
by
congress
of
that
court's
intentions.
furthermore,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
rule
3
of
the
old
rules
which
limits
appeal
to
five
days
after
entry
of
judgment
of
conviction
and
comparing
it
with
rule
37
(a)
(2)
which
allows
10
days
for
appeal
after
entry
of
judgment
or
order
appealed
from,
further
manifest
the
intention
of
the
court.
entry
of
judgment
of
conviction
clearly
purports
that
these
rules
were
to
apply
to
after
verdict
appeals.
however,
by
changing
the
language
into
leading
judgment
of
conviction
to
judgment
or
ordered
appealed
from,
they
have
removed
the
language
of
limitation
and
i
believe
have
opened
the
rules
to
a
wider
scope
than
what
they
had
under
old
rule
3.
furthermore,
37
(a)
(2)
provides
that
the
united
states
has
a
right
to
appeal
as
authorized
by
statute
and
that
that
appeal
must
be
taken
within
30
days
after
the
entry
of
order
or
judgment
appealed
from.
now
the
government
has
authorized
a
right
to
appeal,
one,
when
--
on
a
decision
or
judgment
setting
aside
or
dismissing
any
indictment.
two,
on
a
judgment
setting
aside
a
conviction
because
of
insufficiency
of
the
indictment.
and
three,
where
the
defendant
has
not
been
put
into
jeopardy
and
a
decision
sustaining
a
motion
in
bar.
now,
one
and
three
of
these
situations
are
before
verdict
appeals.
only
number
two
is
an
after
verdict
appeal.
also,
18
u.s.c.
1404
allows
before
verdict
appeals
on
motions
to
suppress
evidence
in
certain
narcotics
cases
and
internal
revenue
cases.
in
fact,
i
believe
that
we
can
say
that
it
is
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
that
if
the
government
has
the
right
to
appeal,
it
is
in
before
verdict
circumstances.
therefore,
i
think
that
by
including
this
language
in
37
(a)
(2),
we
have
again
manifested
the
court's
intention
that
37
(a)
(2)
apply
both
to
before
verdict
appeals
and
after
verdict
appeals.
now,
i
think
it
can
be
argued
that
1404
and
3731
which
gives
the
government
the
right
to
appeal
within
themselves
carry
a
30-day
appeal
provision.
however,
i
do
not
believe
that
this
lessens
the
effect
of
37
(a)
(2).
i
think
that
37
(a)
(2)
can
well
be
viewed
as
being
a
backstop
or
insurance
for
any
appellate
proceedings
that
might
be
given
to
the
government
and
the
fact
that
30-day
provision
is
included
in
1404
and
3731
of
title
18,
does
not
in
anyway
lessen
the
effect
of
37
(a)
(2).
i
will
concede
that
--
well,
let
me
state
first
that
the
fifth
circuit
in
holding
that
the
appeal
was
timely
filed,
unfortunately
did
not
see
fit
to
state
what
rule
is
applicable.
therefore,
i
believe,
we
have
to
accept
one
of
two
things.
either
there
is
no
time
limit
for
filing
an
appeal
in
this
case
or
the
civil
rules,
rule
73
(a)
which
would
allow
30
days
to
file
has
to
be
accepted
as
being
the
rule
that
we're
concerned
with
here.
i
believe
that
neither
of
this
--
either
of
this
is
true,
i
think
73
(a)
is
clearly
not
applicable
because
it
by
its
own
nature
states
that
it
is
limited
only
to
a
--
to
the
case
of
a
civil
nature.
now,
we
come
then
to
the
alternative
that
there
is
no
time
limit
for
filing
an
appeal.
i
don't
believe
that
this
is
true.
now,
the
defendants
or
the
respondents
suggest
that
mandamus
is
the
appropriate
method
of
review
in
this
case.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
mandamus
is
the
appropriate
method
here.
i
believe
that
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
the
right
to
issue
mandamus
relief
under
1651
of
title
28
under
the
old
section.
but
i
don't
believe
that
we
should
be
concerned
with
whether
the
power
exists
but
whether
or
not
this
case
is
an
appropriate
case
for
the
exercise
of
that
power.
traditionally,
mandamus
has
been
used
to
confine
a
--
inferior
court
to
an
exercise
of
its
lawful
jurisdiction,
or
on
the
other
hand,
to
compel
it
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction
whether
it
is
its
duty
to
do
so.
in
bankers
life
and
casualty
versus
harlan,
the
district
court
ordered
a
severance
and
transfer
of
a
case
because
of
improper
venue.
and
this
court
held
that
mandamus
was
not
the
proper
method
of
review
because
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
on
a
question
of
law
decisive
of
the
issue
was
made
in
the
exercise
of
that
court's
jurisdiction,
to
decide
issues
properly
brought
before
it.
in
its
decision,
even
if
erroneous,
involved
no
abuse
of
judicial
power
and
therefore,
it
was
not
reviewable
by
mandamus
but
reviewable
instead
by
appeal.
in
roche
versus
evaporated
milk,
this
court
held
that,
again,
that
the
lawful
exercise
of
court's
jurisdiction
involved
no
abuse
of
discretion
or
usurpation
of
power.
and
roche
further
set
down
three
points,
guidelines
of
which
the
court
should
use
in
determining
whether
the
extraordinary
remedy
of
mandamus
lie.
and
those
guidelines
were
that
the
trial
judge
act
within
his
jurisdiction,
did
his
act
or
omission,
thwart
or
tend
to
thwart
appellate
review,
and
third,
that
mandamus
could
not
be
used
as
a
substitute
for
the
appellate
procedures
prescribed
by
statute.
and
i
submit
that
the
case
that
we
have
here
is
exactly
in
point
with
the
roche
case
and
with
the
bankers
life
and
casualty
company
and
also
with
--
in
ex
parte
roe.
what
judge
sloan
had
done
here
was
to
do
exactly
what
he
was
required
to
do,
and
that
is
to
rule
upon
the
removability
that
was
before
him.
he
was
in
--
since
exercising
his
jurisdiction
--
and
as
exercising
that
jurisdiction,
he
made
the
decision
to
remand
them
back
to
the
state
court.
he
had
not
usurped
any
of
his
power.
he
had
not
abused
any
of
his
discretion.
as
i
say,
he
has
fallen
immediately
within
the
guidelines
of
the
roche
framework
that
is
he
has
not
afforded
appellate
review
because
appellate
review
has
been
provided.
i
believe
that
under
1447
(d),
the
remand
could
be
properly
reviewed
on
appeal.
also,
the
remand
could
be
taken
up
to
the
state
court
system,
and
after
going
to
the
state
court
system,
then
come
for
a
final
review
to
this
court.
so,
there
has
been
no
affording
of
appellate
review
in
that
sense.
furthermore,
the
appeal
procedures
provided
are
quite
adequate
and
i
think
this
is
well
attested
to
by
the
number
of
cases
that
has
been
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief
that
have
been
brought
before
this
court
and
have
been
decided
such
as
neal
versus
delaware,
smith
versus
mississippi
--
all
reached
this
court
via
the
appeals
route
through
the
state
court
system
and
ultimately
for
final
appeal
to
this
court.
therefore,
i
suggest
to
you
gentlemen
that
37
(a)
(2)
is
applicable
to
this
proceeding
and
therefore
the
cases
should
be
--
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
overruled
and
the
remand
order
of
judge
sloan
sustained
and
that
--
the
case
was
allowed
to
be
sent
back
to
the
fulton
county
district
court.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
does
not.
now,
this
arises
only
in
the
rachel
case.
i
might
also
add
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
with
the
exception
of
the
37
(a)
(2)
which
whether
or
not
the
appeal
would
be
finally
filed,
but
i
might
add
that
judge
boyd
sloan
has
81
other
cases
that
are
now
before
him
in
which
he
is
waiting
to
rule
upon,
pending
the
outcome
of
the
rachel
case.

k.

mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
as
follows.
on
august
the
2nd,
1963,
a
grand
jury
of
fulton
county
superior
court
in
atlanta,
georgia
indicted
the
defendant,
thomas
rachel
and
19
other
defendants
in
separate
indictments
for
a
violation
of
the
georgia
law
making
it
a
misdemeanor
to
fail
and
refuse
to
leave
the
premises
of
another
after
having
been
requested
to
leave
by
the
person
in
charge
of
the
premises.
the
incident
for
which
the
defendants
were
indicted
occurred
on
the
17th
of
june
1963
when
the
defendant
attempting
to
be
seated
and
served
in
leb's
restaurant
in
atlanta,
georgia,
failed
and
refused
to
leave
the
restaurant
after
having
been
asked
to
do
so
by
the
manager
of
the
restaurant.
the
indictment
against
the
other
19
defendants
contained
identical
allegations
to
the
rachel
indictment
with
the
exception
that
in
some
instances,
the
misdemeanor
was
alleged
to
have
been
committed
on
another
date
and
at
a
different
restaurant.
on
february
the
17th,
1964,
the
defendant
rachel
and
the
other
19
defendants
filed
a
petition
for
removal
in
the
u.s.
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
under
the
authority
of
sections
1443
(1)
and
(2)
and
1446,
title
28
u.s.c.
the
petition
alleged
that
georgia
was
by
a
statute
perpetuating
customs
and
serving
members
of
the
negro
race
in
places
of
public
accommodation
on
a
racially
discriminatory
basis
and
on
terms
and
conditions
not
imposed
on
white
race.
also,
they
were
being
prosecuted
for
acts
done
under
color
of
authority
derived
from
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
and
for
refusing
to
do
an
act
inconsistent
therewith.
on
february
the
18th,
1964,
united
states
district
court
judge
boyd
sloan,
remanded
the
cases
to
fulton
county
superior
court
stating
that
the
petition
for
removal
failed
to
allege
sufficient
facts
for
removal
of
the
case
to
the
federal
court
system.
on
march
5th,
1964,
the
defendants
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
from
the
remand
order
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
and
on
the
12th
of
march,
the
state
of
georgia
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
and
the
defendants
filed
a
motion
to
stay
the
remand
order
pending
the
appeal
before
the
fifth
circuit.
on
that
day,
a
hearing
was
held
before
a
three-judge
panel
and
a
stay
was
granted
by
a
two
to
one
division
of
the
court.
on
the
5th
of
march
1965,
after
hearing
oral
argument,
the
court
of
appeals
by
a
divided
three-judge
panel
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
hold
a
hearing
and
to
dismiss
the
prosecution
if
it
established
that
the
removal
of
the
defendants
from
the
various
places
of
public
accommodation
was
done
for
racially
discriminatory
reasons.
a
timely
petition
was
filed
by
the
state
of
georgia
for
rehearing
en
banc
and
this
was
denied
on
april
19th,
1965
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
october
the
11th,
1965
on
three
grounds
with
which
we
are
concerned
here.
first,
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
appeal
because
the
notice
of
appeal
of
the
remand
order
was
filed
six
days
beyond
the
10-day
time
limit
required
by
rule
37
(a)
(2)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
secondly,
that
the
petition
for
removal
failed
to
allege
sufficient
facts
or
valid
ground
for
removing
state
prosecutions
to
the
federal
court,
and
third,
the
court
of
appeals
aired
in
directing
the
district
court
to
look
for
only
one
criteria
on
the
hearing
and
to
dismiss
the
state
court
prosecution
if
that
single
element
was
found.
that
element
of
course
is
that
the
arrest
and
removal
of
the
defendants
from
the
various
restaurants
in
atlanta,
georgia
was
done
because
of
race
discrimination.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i
would
like
to
limit
myself
only
to
the
first
consideration
that
being
the
rule
of
criminal
procedure
37
(a)
(2)
and
leave
the
latter
two
questions
to
mr.
sparks
my
co-counsel.
it
is
our
contention
that
rule
37
(a)
(2)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
apply
to
this
case
and
apply
to
all
appeals
from
criminal
prosecution
either
before
verdict
or
after
verdict.
by
act
of
february
24th,
1933,
as
amended,
this
court
was
given
the
authority
to
prescribe
rules
of
practice
and
procedure
after
verdict
finding
of
guilty
by
the
court
if
the
jury
was
waived
or
pleas
of
guilty.
on
may
7th,
1934
pursuant
to
the
above
act,
this
court
promulgated
13
rules
which
they
entitle
“rules
of
practice
and
proceedings”
after
plea
of
guilty,
verdict
of
guilty,
or
finding
of
guilty.
rule
3
of
this
rules
which
is
the
predecessor
to
rule
37
(a)
(2)
stated
that
an
appeal
must
be
taken
five
days
after
entry
of
judgment
of
conviction.
now,
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
language
entry
of
judgment
of
conviction
because
i
believe
that
by
the
use
of
this
language
and
by
the
title
of
the
13
rules,
it
is
clear
that
these
13
rules
apply
only
to
after
verdict
appeals.
by
act
of
june
29th,
1940,
congress
gave
the
court
authority
to
prescribe
rules
of
practice
in
the
criminal
cases
prior
to
and
including
verdict,
finding
of
guilty
or
not
guilty
by
the
court.
this
act
required
that
these
rules
should
be
reported
to
congress
before
they
became
effective.
and
pursuant
to
this
act,
this
court
have
promulgated
rules
1-31
and
40-60
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
by
order
dated
december
26,
1944.
these
rules
were
submitted
to
congress
and
became
effective
on
march
21st,
1946
as
provided
by
rule
59.
by
an
order
dated
february
the
8th,
1946,
the
court
prescribed
rules
32-39
pursuant
to
the
1933
enabling
act,
allowing
the
court
to
promulgate
rules
after
verdict
and
pleas
of
guilty.
the
court
made
these
rules
effective
on
the
same
date
that
they
made
rules
1-31
and
40-60
effective.
also,
by
this
order,
the
court
instructed
that
these
rules
be
titled
the
“federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure”
and
that
all
60
rules
should
be
consecutively
numbered.
i
think
that
it
is
clear
from
this
february
8,
1946
order
that
the
supreme
court
intended
that
rules
1-60
should
serve
as
a
complete
set
of
criminal
rules
of
procedure.
this
is
manifested
by
all
the
rules
becoming
effective
on
the
same
day
by
the
title
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
also
by
the
fact
that
the
court
had
them
numbered
consecutively.
also,
rule
1
of
the
federal
rule
state
the
scope
of
these
rules
and
that
is
that
they
are
to
govern
the
procedures
in
courts
of
the
united
states
in
all
criminal
procedures
except
as
listed
in
rule
54.
it
should
also
be
noted
that
rule
54
specifically
applies
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
to
remove
proceedings.
also,
rule
57
further
outlines
the
purpose
of
the
court
and
that
it
states
that
these
rules
shall
govern
all
criminal
proceedings
thereafter
commenced.
now,
i
believe
that
if
the
court
had
intended
to
separate
rules
32-39,
and
1-31,
and
40-60
into
two
separate
categories,
it
would
not
have
gone
to
the
trouble
of
numbering
the
rules
consecutively,
entitled
--
titling
them
as
they
did,
and
making
them
effective
on
the
same
day.
also,
it
seems
to
me
that
these
rules
were
prepared
by
an
advisotory
committee
appointed
by
the
supreme
court,
and
so,
we
cannot
say
that
this
is
a
case
where
the
left
hand
did
not
know
what
the
right
hand
was
doing.
the
court
would
have
been
explicit
in
separating
the
two
rules
if
they
were
to
retain
the
before
verdict
and
after
verdict
limitations.
now,
i
submit
if
the
distinction
ever
existed
as
to
the
applications
of
rules
32-39
to
limit
that
only
to
after
verdict
appeals,
that
this
has
been
rectified
by
the
enactment
of
title
18
of
united
states
code.
this
act
was
entitled
“an
act
to
revise
and
codify
and
enacted
into
positive
law
title
18
of
the
united
states
code”.
all
sixty
rules
of
criminal
procedure
are
embodied
within
this
title.
rule
37
(a)
(2)
specifically
incorporated
by
reference
in
section
37
and
32
of
that
title.
and
i
think
it's
clear,
as
i've
said
before,
by
the
title
of
the
rules,
by
them
being
numbered
consecutively,
and
by
them
being
enacted
to
take
effect
on
the
same
day
that
the
court
intended
that
these
rules
would
cover
all
criminal
proceedings.
and
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
title
18,
which
states
that
title
18
was
the
culmination
of
several
years
work
and
that
every
provision
has
been
brought
down
to
date,
and
the
laws
have
been
rearranged
and
the
language
modernized
and
simplified,
and
that
many
provisions
were
combined
and
overlapping
eliminated,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
revisers
undoubtedly
realize
what
the
purpose
of
the
supreme
court
and
the
intention
of
the
supreme
court
was
in
promulgating
rules
1-60.
and
i
think
that
the
enactment
of
title
18,
which
incorporates
the
entire
set
of
sixty
rules
of
federal
criminal
procedure,
is
an
acceptance
by
congress
of
that
court's
intentions.
furthermore,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
rule
3
of
the
old
rules
which
limits
appeal
to
five
days
after
entry
of
judgment
of
conviction
and
comparing
it
with
rule
37
(a)
(2)
which
allows
10
days
for
appeal
after
entry
of
judgment
or
order
appealed
from,
further
manifest
the
intention
of
the
court.
entry
of
judgment
of
conviction
clearly
purports
that
these
rules
were
to
apply
to
after
verdict
appeals.
however,
by
changing
the
language
into
leading
judgment
of
conviction
to
judgment
or
ordered
appealed
from,
they
have
removed
the
language
of
limitation
and
i
believe
have
opened
the
rules
to
a
wider
scope
than
what
they
had
under
old
rule
3.
furthermore,
37
(a)
(2)
provides
that
the
united
states
has
a
right
to
appeal
as
authorized
by
statute
and
that
that
appeal
must
be
taken
within
30
days
after
the
entry
of
order
or
judgment
appealed
from.
now
the
government
has
authorized
a
right
to
appeal,
one,
when
--
on
a
decision
or
judgment
setting
aside
or
dismissing
any
indictment.
two,
on
a
judgment
setting
aside
a
conviction
because
of
insufficiency
of
the
indictment.
and
three,
where
the
defendant
has
not
been
put
into
jeopardy
and
a
decision
sustaining
a
motion
in
bar.
now,
one
and
three
of
these
situations
are
before
verdict
appeals.
only
number
two
is
an
after
verdict
appeal.
also,
18
u.s.c.
1404
allows
before
verdict
appeals
on
motions
to
suppress
evidence
in
certain
narcotics
cases
and
internal
revenue
cases.
in
fact,
i
believe
that
we
can
say
that
it
is
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
that
if
the
government
has
the
right
to
appeal,
it
is
in
before
verdict
circumstances.
therefore,
i
think
that
by
including
this
language
in
37
(a)
(2),
we
have
again
manifested
the
court's
intention
that
37
(a)
(2)
apply
both
to
before
verdict
appeals
and
after
verdict
appeals.
now,
i
think
it
can
be
argued
that
1404
and
3731
which
gives
the
government
the
right
to
appeal
within
themselves
carry
a
30-day
appeal
provision.
however,
i
do
not
believe
that
this
lessens
the
effect
of
37
(a)
(2).
i
think
that
37
(a)
(2)
can
well
be
viewed
as
being
a
backstop
or
insurance
for
any
appellate
proceedings
that
might
be
given
to
the
government
and
the
fact
that
30-day
provision
is
included
in
1404
and
3731
of
title
18,
does
not
in
anyway
lessen
the
effect
of
37
(a)
(2).
i
will
concede
that
--
well,
let
me
state
first
that
the
fifth
circuit
in
holding
that
the
appeal
was
timely
filed,
unfortunately
did
not
see
fit
to
state
what
rule
is
applicable.
therefore,
i
believe,
we
have
to
accept
one
of
two
things.
either
there
is
no
time
limit
for
filing
an
appeal
in
this
case
or
the
civil
rules,
rule
73
(a)
which
would
allow
30
days
to
file
has
to
be
accepted
as
being
the
rule
that
we're
concerned
with
here.
i
believe
that
neither
of
this
--
either
of
this
is
true,
i
think
73
(a)
is
clearly
not
applicable
because
it
by
its
own
nature
states
that
it
is
limited
only
to
a
--
to
the
case
of
a
civil
nature.
now,
we
come
then
to
the
alternative
that
there
is
no
time
limit
for
filing
an
appeal.
i
don't
believe
that
this
is
true.
now,
the
defendants
or
the
respondents
suggest
that
mandamus
is
the
appropriate
method
of
review
in
this
case.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
mandamus
is
the
appropriate
method
here.
i
believe
that
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
the
right
to
issue
mandamus
relief
under
1651
of
title
28
under
the
old
section.
but
i
don't
believe
that
we
should
be
concerned
with
whether
the
power
exists
but
whether
or
not
this
case
is
an
appropriate
case
for
the
exercise
of
that
power.
traditionally,
mandamus
has
been
used
to
confine
a
--
inferior
court
to
an
exercise
of
its
lawful
jurisdiction,
or
on
the
other
hand,
to
compel
it
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction
whether
it
is
its
duty
to
do
so.
in
bankers
life
and
casualty
versus
harlan,
the
district
court
ordered
a
severance
and
transfer
of
a
case
because
of
improper
venue.
and
this
court
held
that
mandamus
was
not
the
proper
method
of
review
because
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
on
a
question
of
law
decisive
of
the
issue
was
made
in
the
exercise
of
that
court's
jurisdiction,
to
decide
issues
properly
brought
before
it.
in
its
decision,
even
if
erroneous,
involved
no
abuse
of
judicial
power
and
therefore,
it
was
not
reviewable
by
mandamus
but
reviewable
instead
by
appeal.
in
roche
versus
evaporated
milk,
this
court
held
that,
again,
that
the
lawful
exercise
of
court's
jurisdiction
involved
no
abuse
of
discretion
or
usurpation
of
power.
and
roche
further
set
down
three
points,
guidelines
of
which
the
court
should
use
in
determining
whether
the
extraordinary
remedy
of
mandamus
lie.
and
those
guidelines
were
that
the
trial
judge
act
within
his
jurisdiction,
did
his
act
or
omission,
thwart
or
tend
to
thwart
appellate
review,
and
third,
that
mandamus
could
not
be
used
as
a
substitute
for
the
appellate
procedures
prescribed
by
statute.
and
i
submit
that
the
case
that
we
have
here
is
exactly
in
point
with
the
roche
case
and
with
the
bankers
life
and
casualty
company
and
also
with
--
in
ex
parte
roe.
what
judge
sloan
had
done
here
was
to
do
exactly
what
he
was
required
to
do,
and
that
is
to
rule
upon
the
removability
that
was
before
him.
he
was
in
--
since
exercising
his
jurisdiction
--
and
as
exercising
that
jurisdiction,
he
made
the
decision
to
remand
them
back
to
the
state
court.
he
had
not
usurped
any
of
his
power.
he
had
not
abused
any
of
his
discretion.
as
i
say,
he
has
fallen
immediately
within
the
guidelines
of
the
roche
framework
that
is
he
has
not
afforded
appellate
review
because
appellate
review
has
been
provided.
i
believe
that
under
1447
(d),
the
remand
could
be
properly
reviewed
on
appeal.
also,
the
remand
could
be
taken
up
to
the
state
court
system,
and
after
going
to
the
state
court
system,
then
come
for
a
final
review
to
this
court.
so,
there
has
been
no
affording
of
appellate
review
in
that
sense.
furthermore,
the
appeal
procedures
provided
are
quite
adequate
and
i
think
this
is
well
attested
to
by
the
number
of
cases
that
has
been
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief
that
have
been
brought
before
this
court
and
have
been
decided
such
as
neal
versus
delaware,
smith
versus
mississippi
--
all
reached
this
court
via
the
appeals
route
through
the
state
court
system
and
ultimately
for
final
appeal
to
this
court.
therefore,
i
suggest
to
you
gentlemen
that
37
(a)
(2)
is
applicable
to
this
proceeding
and
therefore
the
cases
should
be
--
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
overruled
and
the
remand
order
of
judge
sloan
sustained
and
that
--
the
case
was
allowed
to
be
sent
back
to
the
fulton
county
district
court.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
does
not.
now,
this
arises
only
in
the
rachel
case.
i
might
also
add
--
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
with
the
exception
of
the
37
(a)
(2)
which
whether
or
not
the
appeal
would
be
finally
filed,
but
i
might
add
that
judge
boyd
sloan
has
81
other
cases
that
are
now
before
him
in
which
he
is
waiting
to
rule
upon,
pending
the
outcome
of
the
rachel
case.
mr.
george
k.
mcpherson,
jr.
i
had,
mr.
chief
justice.
