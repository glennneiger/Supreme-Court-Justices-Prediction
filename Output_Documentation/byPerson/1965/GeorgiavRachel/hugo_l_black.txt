they
raised

would
in

--
justice

--
but
the
problem,
motion
to
dismiss
on
the

of

justice

can
you
have
a
hearing
on
that
and
they
would
produce
if
they

a
state
could
not
produce
any
evidence
of
violence
by
then
you'd
say
--
justice

black
(voice

justice

and
you
wouldn't
have
a
trial
though.
justice

could
be

justice

held

full
scale
trial
then,
wouldn't
you?
justice

the
court
overruled
their
motion,
why,
i
suppose
you'd
have
a
full
scale
trial?
justice

you
mean
the
georgia
court.
justice

they
don't
have
it
in
(inaudible)
georgia
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
neither
local
--
neither
the
local
district
court
--
federal
court
nor
the
local
state
court,
that
had
the
cases
before
them
during
that
time,
you're
asserting.
justice

(inaudible)
--
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time
but
i
think
it's
a
complex
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
amsterdam,
may
i
ask
you,
i
don't
know,
have
there
been
any
efforts
to
remove
cases
of
defendants
who
were
arrested
in
california
during
the
watts
episode?
had
there
been
any
questions,
the
efforts
here
to
remove
those
cases
to
federal
courts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
be
rather
easy
to
charge,
would
it
not,
what
you
say
is
all
is
necessarily
charged
in
order
to
have
a
trial
on
that
issue
in
the
federal
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
new
york,
has
there
been
any
effort
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they
removed
any?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
law
that
you're
arguing
now
doesn't
apply
just
to
some
states,
it
applies
to
all
of
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked
you
that
question
because
i've
gathered
from
your
argument,
if
i
understand
it
so
fully,
any
case,
criminal
or
civil
against
a
colored
man
anywhere
in
the
united
states
can
--
this
question
can
be
raised
or
removed
and
if
an
affidavit
is
made
that
it
involves
prejudice
against
him
on
account
of
his
color,
they
can
then
require
the
federal
judge
to
pass
on
the
fact
to
whether
that's
true
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
it
--
that's
what
i
meant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
allow
removal
but
it
would
allow
--
it
would
be
a
reason
for
the
court
to
have
to
pass
on
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
prosecution
takes
place
in
any
state
against
the
person
of
color,
would
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
has
something
--
does
have
something
to
do
with
what
we
decide,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
might
not
be
dishonest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
we
assume
that
they
would
be
dishonest
if
(voice

the
places
whether
there's
been
any

justice
hugo
l.

i
was
not
talking
about
abuse.
i
thought
that
there
are
many
cases
why
those
things
couldn't
be
alleged,
murder
cases
and
every
other
kind
of
cases.
justice
hugo

(inaudible)
there
of
the
--

you
--
removal,
would
they
not,
if
the
allegation
was
made
under
oath,
as
you
say
that
if
this
was
because
of
prejudice
against
him,
discrimination
against
him
