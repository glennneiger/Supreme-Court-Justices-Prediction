justice
abe
fortas
mr.
sparks.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
your
reaction
to
this.
it
seems
to
me
possible
that
revealing
what
they
--
an
issue
here
that
has
several
layers
to
it.
first,
as
i
understand
that
the
district
court
here
on
the
basis
of
perhaps
or
by
row
of
decisions,
or
if
you
just
held
that
the
1443
was
not
available
because
there
was
no
state
statute
or
ordinance
or
constitution
integration
here
so
that
it
may
be
that
we
have
that
issue
before
us
is
1443
available
only
where
a
state
statute
etcetera
is
controlled
or
is
controlling
or
seems
to
control
state
action,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
second
issue
may
be
what
standards
should
govern
the
district
court
in
a
--
in
determining
whether
to
remand
the
case
to
the
state
court.
now,
the
district
court
here
did
not
reach
that
issue,
did
it?
justice
abe
fortas
because
of
this
decision
on
the
first
point.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
yes.
alright,
well,
listen,
i
want
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
want
to
take
this
theoretically
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
with
you
if
i
may.
justice
abe
fortas
and
let's
assume
that
the
petition
did
set
out,
didn't
--
did
make
proper
allegations
whatever
they
may
be?
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
--
here
is
that
the
district
court
did
not
reach
the
question
of
what
allegations
have
to
be
made
to
make
out
a
case
for
remands
or
for
removal,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
did
not
go
beyond
that
so
that
we
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
should
disagree.
if
we
should
disagree,
if
we
should
hold
that
there
can
be
factors
other
than
the
presence
of
a
state
statute
or
constitutional
provision
which
would
provide
inadequate
basis
for
a
removal
under
1443,
then
i
assume
there
would
arise
a
question
as
to
what
are
those
other
circumstances
that
were
just
by
removal,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
district
court
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
has
not
passed
on
that?
justice
abe
fortas
wasn't
this
petition
filed
before
the
civil
rights
act,
was
it
passed?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
think
--
you
don't
think
that
makes
any
difference?
justice
abe
fortas
before
you
do
that,
why
do
--
why
wouldn't
the
pendency
of
the
case
in
the
federal
court
have
the
same
effect
as
its
pendency
in
a
state
court?
your
proposition
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
must
be
that
that's
because
the
affected
community
believed
that
they
can't
get
a
fair
trial
in
a
state
court.
justice
abe
fortas
but
again
--
again
you're
assuming
that
the
--
again,
you're
making
a
comparative
evaluation
in
the
federal
and
in
state
court?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
when
it
comes
back
it
seems
to
me,
to
the
same
proposition
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
that
its
less
repressive
in
the
practical
circumstances
but
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out
is
that
the
reason
that
it's
less
repressive
involves
a
judgment
as
to
the
fairness
in
the
expedition
or
the
lack
thereof
in
the
state
court
proceedings.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
your
proposition
no
matter
how
you'd
cut
it,
no
matter
how
you
phrase
it
may
come
back
to
one
of
a
comparative
--
a
prediction
as
to
how
the
state
courts
rely.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
of
course
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
very
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you
don't
quite
rule
the
generality
of
that
do
you,
with
respect
to
defense
lawyers?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
maybe
you
better
not
answer
it.
now,
but
what
bothers
me
mr.
amsterdam
is
you
say
that
commerce
has
in
effect
directed
or
established
it,
the
very
least
established
a
presumption
that
all
cases
where
a
person
is
arrested
for
--
is
arrested
in
the
course
of
the
civil
rights
--
of
civil
rights
activity
should
be
tried
in
the
federal
district
courts.
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
now
--
then
to
establish
that,
don't
you
have
to
tell
us
--
illuminate
this,
a
little
bit
about
1443?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
only
source
of
that,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
--
let's
take
the
same
case
that
you
put
and
let's
suppose
that
the
negro
had
invited
the
white
man
into
his
house
and
this
go
along
with
these
implausible
facts
if
you
will
as
of
that
time.
and
let's
assume
that
the
--
they've
been
having
a
quiet
luncheon
there
and
then
the
negro
had
pulled
out
a
gun
and
killed
the
man
and
--
for
purposes
of
robbing
him.
and
then
the
state
brought
a
prosecution
against
him.
now,
our
problem
then
--
under
this
statute
is
what
happens
from
that
point
on
and
i
say,
once
you
assume
that
the
conduct
is
--
once
you
assume
the
characteristics
of
the
conduct,
you
solved
a
lot
of
problems
but
our
problem
here
is,
how
do
you
get
to
that
kind
of
a
judgment?do
you
get
it
in
--
to
it
in
the
state
court
or
the
federal
court
and
when?
that
is
a
--
the
answer
follows
--
may
follow
anyway
once
you
make
that
assumption.
justice
abe
fortas
but
we're
lawyers
and
we're
judges
and
we
have
to
confront
the
problem
of
how
do
you
make
that?
justice
abe
fortas
every
one
of
these
cases.
i
assume,
unless
states
are
going
the
dismiss
them,
a
state
will
say,
civil
rights
has
no
part
in
this.
this
is
violence
of
--
or
something
in
the
sort.
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
defendant,
in
every
one
of
these
cases
will
say,
i
hadn't
--
i
didn't
kick
anybody,
there
was
no
violence
involved
here,
its
entirely
civil
rights.
and
as
i
see
this,
perhaps
i'm
wrong,
the
critical,
legal
and
judicial
problem
is
how,
when
and
where
--
how,
when
and
where
that
threshold
decision
is
to
be
made
to
be
such
one,
the
critical
problems.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what's
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
what's
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
got
to
do
with
this
case,
that's
what
(inaudible)
mean.
that
is
to
say
the
1964
act
was
passed
after
this
arrest,
wasn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
(voice
overlap)
--
well
then
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
bridge
those
two,
mr.
amsterdam?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
understand
the
--
then
but
you're
relying
on
rights
as
i
understand
you
granted
by
the
1964
act
as
relating
back
to
an
arrest
which
was
made
prior
to
the
1964
act.
i
don't
believe
hamm
touches
that
particular
matter.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
your
procedural
argument
whether
i
agree
with
it
or
not
but
you
still
have
a
problem
of
getting
--
of
relating
the
incidents
here
to
the
statute
without
the
benefit
of
the
civil
rights
act
separating
out
the
question
of
remand
juris
--
of
remand
jurisdiction
and
the
availability
of
that
remedy
to
you.
you
still
have
the
problem
it
seems
to
me
of
relating
the
events
here
to
1443.
and
you
can't
do
it
perhaps
by
--
that
perhaps
you
cannot
do
it
by
reliance
on
the
civil
rights
act.
that's
the
question
to
which
i
think
both
the
chief
justice
and
i
had
been
trying
to
solicit
your
assistance.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
we
got
started
on
this
because
in
response
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
i
think
it
was
some
time
ago,
you
said
you're
not
relying
on
the
--
this
as
a
constitutionally
protected
right
for
purposes
of
this
case.
so,
we
start
looking
for
some
other
source
of
the
right.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
sparks.
justice
abe

may
