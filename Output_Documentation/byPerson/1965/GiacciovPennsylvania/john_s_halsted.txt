mr.
john
s.
halsted
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
at
the
outset,
it
might
be
helpful
for
the
court
if
they
perhaps
understood
the
basic
position
of
costs
in
criminal
cases
in
pennsylvania.
to
answer
some
of
the
questions,
costs
in
felony
cases
follow
the
conviction.
if
the
felon
is
found
not
guilty
the
costs
are
paid
by
the
county.
in
misdemeanor
cases
only
as
we
have
here,
the
costs
can
be
placed
three
places
by
the
jury;
on
the
prosecutor,
on
the
defendant
or
in
the
county.
the
jury
also
has
the
option
of
splitting
them
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
defendant.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
i
cannot
--
mr.
justice
stewart.
usually
the
court
in
these
matter
charges
of
the
jury
that
police
officers
or
rather
other
public
officials
during
their
duty
should
not
have
the
costs
placed
upon
them
unless
it's
a
clear
abuse
of
their
power.
in
other
words,
clearly
a
case
where
the
officer
was
using
his
authority
to
persecute
someone,
but
it
--
it
applies
to
all
prosecutors,
be
they
--
officials
or
a
private
prosecutor
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
prosecutor
district
attorney.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
not
usually.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
no.
it
is
further
limited
--
that
the
prosecutor
must
testify
at
the
trial
in
order
to
have
the
costs
placed
upon
him
even
though
on
the
back
of
the
bill
of
indictment,
a
name
is
indorsed
as
prosecutor,
the
jury
can
find
that
they
are
not
the
real
prosecutor
and
put
them
on
whoever
testifies,
who
they
feel
is
the
prosecutor
or
the
moving
force
behind
the
prosecution.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
s.
halsted
of
any
fact.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
yes.
any
fact
can
make
out
the
case
of
the
crime
charged
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
they
have
none.
this
--
the
costs
are
compiled
by
the
clerk
of
courts
from
his
records
and
the
jury
has
no
idea
what
the
cost
would
amount
to
when
they
pay
a
sentence.
they
merely
find
that
the
defendant
or
prosecutors,
as
the
case
may
be
or
the
county
shall
pay
the
cost
and
they
are
assessed
by
the
clerk.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
yes.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
it
has
no
idea
what
the
cost
amount
to.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
no.
these
are
record
costs.
these
are
the
cost
which
include
--
they
do
include
the
justice
of
the
peace
cost,
the
magistrate
cost
in
that
when
he
sends
a
transcript
to
the
clerk
of
courts,
there
is
a
$10
fee
which
the
county
immediately
pays
him
and
then,
the
county
is
reimbursed
by
the
prosecutor
or
the
defendant
as
the
case
may
be
or
the
county
ends
up
bearing
it.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that
is
correct
and
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
these,
as
mr.
hearn
point
out
are
primarily
witness
fees
because
every
time
a
witness
appears
at
grand
jury
or
for
trial,
every
time
that
he
signed
in
to
appear
in
that
case,
he
is
entitled
to
the
statutory
witness
fee
plus
mileage
and
that
--
if
such
a
case
which
involves
a
lot
of
witnesses
it
soon
builds
up.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
not
directly,
no.
the
county
in
the
first
instance
pays
the
justice
of
the
peace
when
he
sends
his
transcript
in.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
yes.
there's
a
statutory
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
i
believe
he's
paid
immediately.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that's
right.
as
soon
as
his
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
yes,
your
honor.
there's
a
--
i
think
its
$10
for
felonies
and
$5
for
misdemeanors
if
--
when
he
turns
his
transcript
in
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
--
the
county
sends
him
a
check
for
that
amount.
yes.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
no.
he
is
entitled
to
that
under
any
case
in
--
if
the
jury
wants
to
under
the
statute
reimburse
the
county
which
is
about
what
it
amounts
to
for
what
they
have
expanded.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that's
correct
or
if
they
may
split
them
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
defendant
if
they
find
it
was
sort
of
a
backyard
fight
or
something
of
that
nature
then
they
--
they
can
both
bear
the
costs.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
yes.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
or
they
can
say
one-third,
two-thirds
of
--
it's
entirely
up
to
them.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
in
the
court's
charge,
the
court
will
say
on
--
so
and
so
is
endorsed
as
a
prosecutor
on
this
bill
of
indictment.
however,
you
may
find
that
he
is
not
the
actual
prosecutor
and
if
another
person
has
testified,
who
you
believe
to
be
the
actual
prosecutor,
you
may
place
the
cost
on
him.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that's
correct.
in
most
of
the
cases,
it's
a
police
officers,
the
prosecutor.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that's
correct.
if
they
feel
that
--
that
he
has
brought
this
out
of
malice
rather
than
--
because
he
honestly
believes
some
crime
has
been
perpetrated
for
some
misdemeanor.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
i
know
of
none.
i
--
from
personal
experience,
very
limited,
i
would
say
infrequently.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
infrequently
and
as
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
observed
and
it's
actually
the
case
of
--
it's
usually
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
factious
but
it's
usually
where
the
defendant
is
guilty
but
the
jury
doesn't
think
that
he
should
bear
the
burn
of
having
a
record
maybe
against
him
–-
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that's
correct
and
that
--
that
that's
actually
how
it
works
the
majority
of
the
time.
it's
a
great
benefit
to
defense
counsel
the
statute
that
is
just
offered.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
s.
halsted
yes.
except
the
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
--
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
observes
it
--
costs
aren't
applying
because
they're
separate
and
apart.
they
follow
in
the
judgment
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
well,
that's
right.
it
comes
right
out
of
his
pocket.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
yes.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
you
can
only
speculate
from
the
history
of
the
act.
back
in
1791
when
the
legislator
first
started
to
deal
with
this,
the
preamble
says,
that
if
the
defendant
always
paid
the
cost
whether
he
was
guilty
or
innocent
and
that
this
worked
as
injustice
on
the
defendant
and
therefore,
they
sought
to
relieving.
in
1804,
they
reenacted
the
statute
and
they
added
the
part
putting
the
defendant
and
the
prosecutor
making
them
possibly
both
of
them
liable.
and
then
in
1860,
they
reenacted
it
with
some
more
embellishments
providing
for
the
divisions
and
a
percentage
placed
in
their
cost.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
i
have
no
idea
unless
they
felt
that
the
jury
were
better
able
to
assess
what
they
thought
was
improper
behavior
which
led
to
the
prosecution.
and
the
any
other
reason
that
i
can
give
possibly
when
the
statute
was
written,
i
would
suppose
that
the
jury
trial
were
more
prevalent.
i'm
only
speculating
on.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
there
--
there
some
dispute
of
that.
as
they
say
in
england
that
this
was
not
so
but
the
pennsylvania,
the
early
pennsylvania
case
say
that
at
least
in
pennsylvania
and
there's
evidence
in
delaware,
some
cases
there
that
guilty
or
not
guilty,
the
defendant
paid
the
cost.
and
there's
a
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
no.
the
english
had
the
statute
somewhat
comparable
to
this
which
if
the
judge
failed
to
certify
that
there
was
a
reasonable
cost
for
bringing
the
prosecution,
the
prosecutor
might
have
to
pay
the
cost
but
there
is
nothing
exactly
like
this.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
it
is.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
i
know
but
i
didn't
notice
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
why
they
picked
on
misdemeanor
defendants
rather
than
felony
in
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
of
--
the
only
thing
i
can
observe
is
what
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
observed
that
may
the
public
interest
in
felony
prosecutions
was
great
enough
that
they
would
bear
the
costs
in
all
cases.
you
might
from
the
legislative
history
go
further
and
speculate
that
it's
the
misdemeanor
cases
which
are
most
likely
to
arise
out
of
personal
feuds
if
you
will
or
things
of
that
nature.
and
that
the
--
perhaps
the
public
doesn't
have
the
greatest
interest
in
some
of
them
as
they
do
in
the
felonies.
i
would
with
regard
to
the
summary
matters
of
the
justice
of
peace
has
broad
power
to
dispose
of
the
costs
as
he
sees
fit.
so
that's
only
speculation,
there's
no
legislative
history
which
states
this.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
it
does
not.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
i
suppose
only
by
tradition
whatever
the
costs
which
the
county
pays
in
which
there
is
a
record
made.
any
costs
which
come
out
of
county
stock
if
you
will
and
which
the
clerk
has
a
record.
i
think
traditionally
that
has
been
considered
on
the
cost
–-
mr.
john
s.
halsted
yes.
he
--
he's
only
allowed
certain
costs
and
they
are
set
out
by
statute
what
he
may
charge
per
case
and
the
same
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
not
in
the
statute
which
were
here
considering,
no.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
well,
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
as
soon
as
the
justice
of
peace
returns
his
transcript
to
the
clerk
of
the
court's
session's
court,
he
is
finished
with
the
case
and
his
costs
are
then
paid
and
the
remaining
cost
--
he
will
have
his
cost
for
$10
plus
a
mileage
for
constable
and
then
the
remaining
cost
or
witness
fees
and
things
that
the
clerk
of
the
court
keeps
when
he
sends
out
a
subpoena
and
a
person
reports
then
he
marks
them
down
for
so
many
days
and
so
many
miles
and
this
is
assessed
as
a
cost.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that's
right.
other
statutes
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that's
right.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
i
see.
of
--
our
first
point
is
that
mr.
hearn
makes
the
point
for
the
appellant
that
there's
no
guidelines
in
the
statute
and
we
say,
you'd
have
to
look
to
the
cases
which
have
developed
and
applied
this
over
the
161
years
that's
been
in
operation
and
traditionally
from
these
cases
the
guidelines
are
--
if
the
court
charges
them
some
misconduct
which
has
given
rise
to
this
prosecution.
in
other
words,
some
possibly
antisocial
behavior
which
you
feel
that
the
county
should
not
have
to
bear
the
cost
for
the
defendants'
behavior
and
you
wish
to
punish
him,
if
you
will,
in
some
regard
and
also
relieve
the
county
from
the
burden
from
these
costs.
so
the
statute
does
not
contain
this
language.
only
the
way
the
court
supply
it
and
the
way
that
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
has
interpret
it,
they
say,
“of
course,
you
could
not
make
a
defendant
pay
cost
in
a
case
where
his
conduct
was
completely
unrelated
to
the
--
to
the
prosecution.
for
instance,
it
would
be
abuse
of
discretion,
i
believe,
should
the
jury
quite
the
cost
on
a
defendant
who
is
found
not
guilty
because
there
was
some
doubt
about
identity
or
he'd
being
the
person
who
was
actually
perpetrated
the
misdemeanor.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
no.
they
follow
the
conviction.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
they
follow
the
conviction
costs
in
cases
of
felonies
and
in
case
of
convicted
misdemeanor
the
costs
are
automatically
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
yes.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that's
right.
it's
not
even
--
it
doesn't
have
to
be
sentenced
that
way,
although
courts
usually
do.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
the
next
point
that
say
that
the
statute
puts
the
defendant
on
clear
notice
that
this
is
a
possibility.
it
doesn't
say
under
what
conditions
but
it
says
if
you
go
to
trial
and
if
the
grand
jury
finds
a
prima
facie
case
and
if
the
commonwealth
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case
and
the
case
goes
to
a
jury
and
the
jury
finds
you
not
guilty,
you
may
not
be
off
the
hook,
you
still
may
have
to
pay
the
cost
of
prosecution
if
they
decide
that
the
--
your
conduct
has
led
to
the
prosecution
and
that
we
say
that
statute
clearly
notifies
the
defendants
that
this
is
a
possibility.
there's
an
objection
that
there
are
no
other
guidelines.
we
would
say
that
if
the
evidentiary
rules
which
control
the
evidence
which
would
be
produced
at
the
trial
of
misdemeanor
would
keep
excess
or
nondescript
or
unessential
facts
from
the
juries
so
that
the
--
it
wouldn't
be
any
prejudicial
information
come
in
because
they
are
circumscribed
by
the
rules
of
evidence.
and
say
that
there's
a
further
safeguard
that
the
court,
if
they
feel
the
jury
has
abused
there
discretion
and
clearly,
mismanaged
the
question
of
costs,
the
court
can
relieve
the
defendant
or
the
prosecutor
if
it
seize
fit
of
from
the
payment
of
these
costs.
so
we
say,
those
are
the
safeguards
which
are
defined
them
these
statutes
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
the
--
the
guidelines
traditionally
used
are
--
if
you
find
that
the
defendant
has
been
guilty
or
has
committed
some
misconduct
which
has
given
arise
to
the
prosecution
in
this
case,
you
may
assess
the
costs
against
it.
if
you
find
that
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
misconduct.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
no!
no,
which
has
given
rise
to
this
prosecution,
that
is
the
way
it's
usually
charged.
some
misconduct
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
no.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
i
would
suppose
so.
if
i
may
take
the
facts
of
this
case
as
an
illustration,
the
defendant
here
was
charged
with
pointing
and
discharging
a
deadly
weapon
which
is
a
misdemeanor.
his
defense
at
trial
was
it
--
it
was
a
blank
pistol
which
he
discharged.
in
other
words,
no
--
if
the
pistol
is
inoperative,
then
there's
no
crime
under
pennsylvania
law.
but
the
jury,
i
suppose
found
it
because
he
discharged
this
blank
pistol
and
because
the
people
brought
the
prosecution
had
no
way
of
knowing
it
was
blank
until
he
so
testified
that
his
conduct
had
given
a
rise
to
the
prosecution
and
that
he
should
pay
the
costs.
that
--
that's
how
it
works.
to
answer
you
question,
it
is
possible
to
having
pay
the
cost
for
something
conduct
it
is
not
a
crime.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
well,
i
could
--
i
think
it
probably
would
if
--
it
was
his
conduct
with
which
gave
rise
to
this
and
the
jury
felt
that
he
was
very
lucky
in
missing
the
conviction
so
to
speak
and
should
relieve
the
county
of
the
payment
of
cost.
it's
a
case-by-case
application.
that's
why
the
jury,
i
suppose,
is
asked
to
make
the
determination.
they
are
ones
who
have
to
view
the
facts
and
come
to
some
conclusion
about
it.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
yes.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
i
can
only
speak
from
personal
experience
and
i
know
of
only
one
case
in
last
five
years.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
no.
however,
the
supreme
court
in
pennsylvania
has
found
that
there
is
a
common
law
power
which
the
--
then
a
case
cited
in
my
brief
which
is
quite
old
in
which
the
court
always
has
supervisory
powers
over
the
question
of
costs
and
over
the
workings
of
the
jury.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
this
would
be
at
the
trial
court,
we're
not
talking
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
no.
not
the
magistrate.
this
would
be
an
elected
judge
at
the
first
trial
court
level.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
sir?
mr.
john
s.
halsted
perhaps,
we're
arguing
about
terms,
but
it's
not
a
magistrate.
it
is
in
fact
the
judge.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
right.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
yes,
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
i
think
he
petitioned
the
court
did
set
aside
the
cost
because
the
jury
he
said
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
the
judge
does.
yes.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
and
he
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that's
correct.
the
--
the
judge
set
it
aside
because
he
found
the
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
not
under
the
statute
but
it
is
a
common
law
power.
should
a
common
law
supervisory
power
over
juries
allows
him
to
do
this
if
they
have
abused
their
discretion
and
it
feels
that
there's
no
evidence
to
sustain
their
finding
on
costs,
he
can
reverse
their
decisions.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
s.
halsted
if
he
doesn't
pay
the
cost
or
he
doesn't
give
security
for
the
payment
within
10
days
and
he
can
be
incarcerated
under
the
statute.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
traditionally,
i
would
suppose
up
to
90
days.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
but
--
there
is
another
statute
in
pennsylvania
which
controls
the
case
of
people
who
cannot
pay
fines
or
costs
and
it's
a
90-day
sentence
and
then
they
are
discharged.
they
can
serve
no
more
than
90
days
on
that
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
no.
that
statute
is
not.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
they
tried
but
the
court
does
not
usually
let
them
argue
this.
they
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
no.
it
has
not.
there's
never
been
any
activity
on
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
i
believe
so.
it
has
to
do
with
the
indigents.
there's
also,
if
the
supreme
court
found
that
if
the
defendant
was
unable
to
pay
these
then
he
could
be
discharged
under
the
old
bankruptcy
statute
without
serving
any
time
whatsoever.
but
if
he
petitioned,
he
could
be
relieved
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
i
would
say,
yes.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
i
would
think
not.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
misconduct
is
--
is
too
vague,
if
there's
not
tried
to
anything.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
no.
i
think
--
i
think
here
you
have
a
somewhat
more.
you
have
misconduct
which
gave
rise
to
this
prosecution.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
no.
i
don't
--
they
don't
think
you
could
say
any
prosecution.
i
think,
it
have
to
do
with
just
like
you
done
here,
it
had
to
be
tied
to
the
particular
fact
situation
so,
when
the
jury
had
all
the
facts
before
the
court
could
say,
if
you
find
it
misconduct
gave
rise
to
this
prosecution
for
this
misdemeanor
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
misconduct,
it
is
obviously
quite
itself
vague
and
the
only
thing
that
we
could
point
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
but
i
think
that
in
this
case,
the
misconduct
is
further
defined
by
the
misdemeanor
statute
which
that
the
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
well
in
this
particular
case,
the
statute
which
was
violating
it
was
pointing
and
discharging
of
firearm.
the
only
evidence
which
would
be
admissible
would
be
evidence
tending
to
prove
or
disprove
that
particular
violation
and
when
the
court
would
charge,
he
would
be
referring
to
evidence
of
that
nature
which
was
aimed
at
proving
or
disproving
a
particular
misdemeanor
rather
than
any
misdemeanor.
the
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
correct.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
it
--
it
is
not
the
--
as
i
understand,
it's
not
an
offense.
this
is
a
determination
by
the
jury
as
to
where
the
court
should
go
and
this
is
the
basis
that
they
do.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that's
correct.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
that's
right
and
the
only
thing
that
we
can
say
is
that
this
misconduct
is
defined
on
a
case-by-case
basis
of
by
the
facts
which
go
into
the
particular
proof
of
the
misdemeanor
which
defendant
is
charged
with.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
yes.
but
we
would
say
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
statute
as
the
appellant
cite
like
lanzetta
and
new
jersey
and
baggett
versus
bullitt
because
here,
you
cannot
arrest
a
person
of
--
for
being
guilty
of
some
misconduct.
he
has
to
be
arrested
and
tried
for
some
misdemeanor
and
it's
only
after
those
facts
are
before
the
jury.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
but
he
--
he
can
be
made
to
pay
the
cost,
that's
right
and
as
i
say
it's
a
unique
situation
in
--
in
pennsylvania
but
according
to
the
legislative
history
or
the
old
cases
that
--
that
this
is
actually
a
relief
of
a
--
of
the
defendant's
common
law
burden
in
which
he
had
to
pay
the
cost
in
every
case,
guilty
or
not
guilty.
the
legislature
here
obviously
hasn't
gone
as
far
as
other
legislatures
that
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
so
and
the
issue
never
arises
until
he's
arrested
for
a
misdemeanor
and
it's
gotten
past
the
grand
jury
and
past
the
demurer
and
it's
actually
there
isn't
enough
of
case
have
made
out.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
i
certainly
will,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
s.
halsted
pertaining
to
the
court's
powers
to
the
--
mr.
john
s.
halsted
it's
on
page
17,
guffy
versus
commonwealth,
that's
to
grant
--
which
is
1853
pennsylvania
supreme
court
cases.
