of

from

of
this
kind?
chief

i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
it
require
the
--
the
defendant
to
pay
costs
in
any
jury
conviction
in
a
misdemeanor
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
does
not.
so
the
jury
still
has
the
option.
it
might
find
him
guilty
of
a
crime
with
which
he
is
charged
but
does
not
require
the
jury
to
assess
costs
against
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i'm
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
speaking.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
halsted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
any
part
of
this
go
to
the
salary
of
the
justices
of
peace?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
pay
him
per
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
the
case
is
finished?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
it
starts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
could
they
know?
how
could
they
know
how
long
it
was
going
to
last
to
what
it
is?
is
there
statutory
fee
for
each
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
a
man
might
be
subpoenaed
as
--
as
a
witness
for
the
prosecution
and
he
would
testify
in
accordance
to
that
subpoena,
and
then
the
jury
might
decide
that
he's
a
real
prosecutor
in
the
case
in
--
and
assess
costs
against
him,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
infrequently?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
juries
--
jury
says
not
guilty
but
said
don't
do
it
again.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
may
i
ask,
this
--
is
there
any
reason
that
it
has
been
stated
why
they
would
do
this
with
the
jury?
why
they
would
have
a
jury
assess
cost
whether
if
a
man
didn't
waive
the
jury,
it
didn't
have
a
jury
that
the
court
could
not
assess
which
cost
against
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
just
one
more
question,
please.
this
is
a
general
state
statute.
this
--
it
applies
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
and
pittsburgh
just
as
it
does
in
the
other
parts
of
the
--
of
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
is
it
--
is
it
followed
in
those
cities?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is,
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
know
but
i
notice
wherever
i
just
--
i
just
want
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
--
may
i
ask
just
one
more
question
on
procedure?
does
the
statute
say
itemize
what
cost
shall
be
assessed
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
is
that
determined?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
no
guidelines
at
all
that
--
that
the
justice
of
peace
must
follow?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
i
will
--
to
make
specific
in
this
case,
i'd
like
to
acknowledge
if
there's
any
thing
in
the
statute
that
--
that
prescribes,
how
this
$263,
or
whatever
it
is,
in
this
case
is
made
up?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
--
well,
now,
how
does
--
how
does
the
justice
of
peace
to
know
that
the
costs
in
this
case
should
be
$263?
chief
justice
earl
warren
must
the
jury
--
must
the
jury
assess
costs
against
a
convicted
misdemeanor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
mean
in
this
kind
of
a
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
this
kind
of
a
case?
conviction
carries
with
it
automatically
the
requirement
to
pay
cost.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
this
conduct
was
in
connection
with
an
assault
on
someone
and
the
defense
was
self-defense,
no
other
defense
except
just
self-defense
and
the
jury
found
that
he
was
not
guilty
because
others
--
of
his
defense
of
self
defense
and
then
it
chose
to
assess
these
costs
against
him,
would
that
be
sustained?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
does
he
have
the
right
to
set
it
aside
under
the
statute
because
he
doesn't
believe
there's
any
misconduct
for
which
the
jury
should
have
assessed
the
cost?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
halsted,
would
you
mind
sending
us
the
citation
of
that
statute
that
limits
incarceration
to
90
days,
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hearn.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
