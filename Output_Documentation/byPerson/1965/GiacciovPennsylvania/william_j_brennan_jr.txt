jr.
what
does
this
cost
cover?
justice

j.

no
transcript
cost?
justice

j.
brennan,
jr.

ordinarily
is
that
the
case?
justice

how
old
is
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

how
is
this
done
mr.
hearn?
is
there
evidence
of
what
the
costs
are
on
which
the
jury
makes
determination
or
is
there
just
an
assessment
cost
that
someone
else
has
computed?
how
is
it
done?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is?
and
who
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
computes
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
here
is
$230.

jr.

what
was
before

that
made
up
$230?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
it
was
--
was
the

told
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
testify
as
to
what,
mr.
halsted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
testify
as
to
what
at
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
bearing
on
guilt
or
innocence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
evidence,
if
there
is
any,
of
actual
out-of-pocket
costs
does
the
jury
hear?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
true
where
there
was
the
misdemeanor
prosecution
and
acquittal
of
the
accused?
where
there's
an
acquittal
of
the
accused,
the
jury
--
if
it
assesses
cost
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
doesn't
know
where
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
could
these
include
the
other
costs
of
a
transcript?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
--
i
think
we
heard
mr.
hearn
was
arguing
of
the
--
the
couple
of
cases
that
where
the
mouth
runs
as
high
--
thousands,
couple
of
thousand
dollars?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
is
it
get
that
high?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
do
you
mean
the
jury
comes
in
with
the
verdict
then
cost
to
be
equally
divided
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
there's
any
suggestion
that
--
i
must
confess,
i've
never
heard
of
a
statute
like
this
before
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
-â€“
and
i
understand,
this
has
been
on
pennsylvania's
books
since
1804.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
suggestions
of
a
reason
why
in
the
case
of
an
acquitted
defendant
this
practice
was
provided?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
made
themselves?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
if
i
get
the
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
happened
to
--
in
acquittal
before
magistrate
in
the
jury,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
is
the
judge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
him
and
a
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
he
--
if
the
jury
says,
costs
against
the
acquitted
defendant
--
the
statute
sets
forth
with
be
shall
sentenced
the
costs.
that's
what
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
is
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
goes
to
the
--
as
i
understand
it,
administratively
it's
handled
by
the
county
clerk?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
may
the
acquitted
defendant
go
back
to
the
trial
judge
and
while
--
ask
that
they
--
that
whole
jury
determination
in
respect
to
cost
be
set
aside?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
he
was
just
one
of
these
stubborn
people
and
there
are
people
like
that,
they
had
thousands
of
dollars
in
the
bank
but
he
wasn't
going
to
sign
any
check
to
those
costs.
he
kept
on
there
with
90
days
limit,
he
has
got
all
the
money
in
the
world?
