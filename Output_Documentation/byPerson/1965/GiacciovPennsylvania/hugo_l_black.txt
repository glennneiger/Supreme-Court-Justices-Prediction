justice
hugo
l.

what
are
the
guidelines
given
to
the
jury?
did
i
understand
you
to
say
when
they
had
told
that
if
you
put
the
defendant,
you
may
also
assess
costs
against?
what
are
the
guidelines
of
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he's
been
guilty
of
some
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
misconduct
which
is
unrelated
to
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
mis
--
was
misconduct
--
are
they
defined
--
have
they
defined
for
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
doesn't
pay
this
cost?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
does
not
pay
the
cost?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
was
a
statute
said
in
terms
if
your
answer
for
the
independence
but
one
issue
by
fine
not
more
than
20
less
than
$5000
as
to
what
--
a
man
who
engaged
in
misconduct,
would
that
be
valid
sentence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
you'll
--
that's
the
standard
your
court
says
should
be
applied
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
it
made
that
the
defense,
that
anyone
guilty
of
misconduct
which
gives
rise
to
its
conference
–
for
the
prosecution
to
define
not
less
than
$550
but
not
more
than
$5000?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
--
wouldn't
your
trouble
at
either
one
unless
it
is
here
being
used
to
the
word
misconduct
to
impose
a
penalty
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
misconduct
giving
rise
to
a
prosecution.
you
still
get
the
word
misconduct
which
is
the
keyword
in
the
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
is
it
supposed
the
finding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
have
the
offensive
firing,
shooting
of
firearm,
that's
the
offense.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
you
say
it,
it
would
be
a
misconduct
and
when
to
shoot
the
firearm
even
though
they
--
they
tried
to
shoot
it
even
though
he
couldn't
shoot
it.
would
that
be
an
offense
under
your
statute,
is
it
offense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
he
has
to
pay
out
money
on
the
basis
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
somebody
has
find
him
guilty
of
misconduct
which
nobody
has
ever
defined
in
the
statute
of
--
by
an
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
very
thing
in
the
rule
against
vagueness
rule
establish
to
prevent,
isn't
it?
try
a
man
for
a
conduct
when
he
didn't
know
when
advance
was
a
crime
or
offense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
he
asked
acquitted
of
the
charge
if
we
can
arrest
him,
put
him
in
jail
for
not
paying
the
fine
for
a
misconduct
which
nobody
has
ever
defined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
this
--
if
you
say,
he
couldn't
have
been
convicted
of
a
crime
if
they'd
just
simply
said
that
he
is
guilty
of
misconduct.
