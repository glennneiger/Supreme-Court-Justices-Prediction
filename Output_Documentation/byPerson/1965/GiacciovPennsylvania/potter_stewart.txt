stewart
by
that
you
mean
the
complainant
or
the
prosecuting
witness?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
some
indication
of
a
--
some
sort
of
a
standard
on
page
2
(a)
of
your
brief.
the
judge's
instructions
to
the
jury
saying
that
if
they
decided
that
the
--
if
you
find
that
the
prosecution
instead
of
being
brought
in
good
faith
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
the
charge
was
on
the
contrary
brought
out
of
malice
or
some
ill
will
or
other
improper
motive,
they
--
the
jury
should
then
impose
the
costs
on
the
prosecutor.
so
at
least,
there's
that
much
of
a
standard
set
out
for
him,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
more
than
a
set
out
for
the
--
as
a
guide
for
their
imposing
cost
of
a
defendant,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
agree
with
your
colleague
that
the
prosecutor
by
that
is
meant
to
be
private
complainant?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
call
a
lawyer
who
tries
the
case
for
the
prosecution?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
call
him
a
prosecutor
too?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
so
this
statute
doesn't
refer
to
him.
the
jury
--
so
the
jury
doesn't
have
the
power
to
impose
the
costs
on
him
personally,
doesn't
it?
