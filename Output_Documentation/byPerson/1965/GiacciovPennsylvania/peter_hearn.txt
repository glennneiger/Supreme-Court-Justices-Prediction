mr.
peter
hearn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
peter
hearn
thank
you
sir.
this
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
challenges
the
constitutionality
of
a
pennsylvania
statute
which
provides
that
when
a
defendant
is
acquitted
of
a
misdemeanor,
the
jury
may,
nevertheless,
impose
court
costs
upon
him
enforceable
by
commitment
to
jail.
in
this
case,
following
defendant's
acquittal,
the
costs
were
assessed
upon
him.
he
thereupon
filed
a
motion
for
relief
of
costs
which
was
granted
by
the
trial
court
because
it
held
the
act
was
unconstitutional
in
that
it
was
void
for
vagueness
and
that
it
violated
certain
procedural
due
process
protections.
the
statute
--
mr.
peter
hearn
$230.95
sir.
on
appeal
to
the
pennsylvania
superior
court,
this
result
was
reversed
and
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
affirmed
the
reversal,
and
on
may
24th
this
court
noted
its
probable
jurisdiction.
mr.
peter
hearn
most
sir,
were
witness
fees.
i
believe
about
a
$180
per
witness
fees.
there
were
some
--
for
the
constable,
some
for
the
justice
of
the
peace,
and
i
believe
that
took
care
of
just
about
--
mr.
peter
hearn
no,
sir,
there
is
not.
mr.
peter
hearn
well
sir,
i
cannot
speak
from
personal
experience
as
to
whether
that
is
or
is
not
as
a
matter
of
custom
in
other
cases
included.
mr.
peter
hearn
well,
sir,
i
know
that
in
philadelphia
county,
he
does
not
from
which
i
come,
but
in
chester
county
from
which
this
case
comes,
i
believe
he
does
but
i'm
not
certain.
mr.
peter
hearn
the
statute
itself
contains
no
standard
whatsoever
on
its
face.
it
merely
provides
that
the
jury
may
impose
costs
upon
an
acquitted
defendant.
if
the
jury
does,
the
court
and
to
use
the
statutory
language,
“shall
forth
with
pass
sentence
to
that
effect
and
order
him
to
be
committed
to
the
jail
of
the
county
until
the
costs
are
paid,
unless
he
gives
security.”
mr.
peter
hearn
the
particular
statute
was
enacted
in
1860.
however,
its
predecessor
was
--
which
was
exactly
the
same
in
statutory
language
was
enacted
in
1804.
therefore,
on
its
face,
the
statute
provides
no
standard
which
restricts
in
any
manner
the
uncontrolled
and
arbitrary
discretion
of
the
jury
in
its
practice.
furthermore,
the
decisions
have
not
removed
this
unconstitutional
vagueness
and
i
submit
that
the
jury
charge
in
this
particular
case
was
typical
of
jury
charges
in
pennsylvania
and
was
in-line
with
the
pennsylvania
authorities
which
attempted
to
construe
this
act.
in
this
case,
the
jury
was
charged
where
defendant
is
found
not
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor,
but
the
jury
finds
that
he
is
been
guilty
of
some
misconduct
less
than
the
offense
which
is
charged,
but
nevertheless,
misconduct
of
some
kind
as
a
result
of
which,
he
should
be
required
to
pay
some
penalty
short
of
conviction.
the
costs
of
prosecution
may
be
placed
upon
him
if
his
misconduct
has
given
rise
to
the
prosecution.
this
charge
stems
primarily
from
an
1818
pennsylvania
decision
which
construes
the
act
of
1804
which
as
i
stated
to
mr.
justice
brennan
was
the
exact
predecessor
of
the
interns
of
statutory
wording
of
the
act
which
is
now
before
the
court.
in
that
case,
the
court
construed
the
statute
and
the
situations
in
which
it
would
be
imposed
as
saying
that
costs
would
be
imposed
upon
a
defendant
whose
conduct
may
have
been
reprehensible
or
whose
innocence
may
have
been
doubtful
and
the
costs
are
imposed
for
impropriety
of
conduct
or
grounds
of
suspicion.
the
result
therefore
is
that
not
only
did
--
does
the
act
not
have
a
standard
on
its
face
but
as
construed,
it
is
unconstitutionality
vague.
there
is
no
standard
to
guide
the
jury
in
its
deliberations.
furthermore,
a
trial
court
in
attempting
to
ascertain
whether
the
jury
abused
its
discretion
has
no
standard
to
guide
it.
mr.
peter
hearn
i
believe
it's
the
latter,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
peter
hearn
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
hearn
well,
it
is
--
it's
the
question
that
--
mr.
peter
hearn
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
hearn
well
i
can
--
there
was
a
charge
of
the
clerk
of
the
court
for
$10
--
mr.
peter
hearn
on
in
--
only
the
portion
of
the
charge
--
of
the
court's
charge
which
dealt
with
cost
has
been
transcribed
in
this
case
and
it
does
not
appear
in
there
so
that
i
--
i
cannot,
but
i
believe
the
practice
is
that
the
--
it
appears
from
that
portion
of
the
charge
that
the
question
of
costs
is
dealt
with
--
in
just
those
terms.
mr.
peter
hearn
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
cannot
state
that
unequivocally.
i
believe
that's
the
case
on
this
--
mr.
peter
hearn
well,
i
do
know
that
in
a
case
pending
the
results
of
this
appeal,
the
costs
have
exceeded
$2000.
that
case
involved
a
misdemeanor
of
macing
and
involving
political
activity
wherein
there
was
a
verdict
of
acquittal,
but
costs
in
excess
of
$2000
were
assessed
against
the
defendant
and
a
motion
for
--
in
arrest
of
judgment
has
been
taken
and
it
has
been
held
pending
the
results
of
this
appeal.
i
--
there's
also
another
pennsylvania
case
involving
criminal
liable
where
--
also,
awaiting
the
results
of
this
appeal
where
i
believe,
although
it
does
not
appear
from
the
published
opinion
that
the
costs
exceeded
$1000
and
in
that
case,
there
was
also
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
mr.
peter
hearn
no,
sir.
it
applies
only
in
the
cases
of
misdemeanors
which
are
tried
by
jury.
it
does
not
apply
in
the
case
of
summary
offenses
nor
does
it
apply
in
the
case
of
felonies
and
in
the
case
of
felonies
and
misdemeanors
--
excuse
me,
summary
offenses,
it
is
expressly
proscribed
by
statute.
so
that
--
mr.
peter
hearn
yes
sir
it
is.
mr.
peter
hearn
no,
it
does
not?
mr.
peter
hearn
that's
right.
but
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
might
point
out
that
in
a
--
another
count
tried
at
the
same
time
as
the
case
here
on
appeal
involving
the
same
appellant,
there
was
a
directed
verdict
for
the
defendant,
but
the
issue
of
costs
was
still
submitted
to
the
jury
with
the
possibility
that
they
would
be
placed
upon
the
acquitted
defendant.
however
in
that
case,
they
were
placed
upon
the
county,
but
i
think
this
shows
that
the
practice
is
that
even
though
the
case
on
the
misdemeanor
is
not
sufficient
to
take
it
to
the
jury,
still
the
costs
issue
does
go.
so
that
--
as
construed
the
standard
here
provides
no
basis
for
an
appellate
court
on
review
to
determine
exactly
why
the
jury
acted
as
it
did.
it's
entirely
possible
for
the
jury
to
punish
some
defendants
and
not
others,
merely
as
it
chooses,
entirely
in
its
arbitrary
discretion.
while
pennsylvania
is
the
only
state
which
i
know
of
which
has
the
statute,
i
submit
that
other
states
would
not
be
precluded
from
enacting
such
a
device
to
abuse
defendants
if
this
statute
were
affirmed
here?
mr.
peter
hearn
if
the
defendant
is
found
not
guilty?
mr.
peter
hearn
found
guilty,
well
then
costs
would
be
imposed
upon
him.
mr.
peter
hearn
well,
this
act
speaks
only
in
a
cases
of
acquittals
and
it
provides
that
they
may
be
placed
upon
the
county
or
the
defendant
or
a
private
prosecutor.
mr.
peter
hearn
no
sir,
it
does
not?
mr.
peter
hearn
insofar
as
this
statute
is
concerned
--
mr.
peter
hearn
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
hearn
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
hearn
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
hearn
no,
sir.
the
private
prosecutor.
mr.
peter
hearn
yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
hearn
yes,
sir.
the
--
the
charge
as
indicated
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
directs
the
jury
to
--
if
they
decide
to
place
the
costs
upon
the
pros
--
private
prosecutor
to
name
him
and
in
this
case,
it
would
be
as
i
understand
the
term
that
complaining
witness.
mr.
peter
hearn
well
sir,
i
think
i
would
because
--
while
it's
not
a
strong
case,
it
still
involves
no
standard
for
the
imposition
of
these
costs.
yes,
it
is
a
different
case
because
a
prosecutor
always
has
the
option
of
whether
he
wishes
to
embark
upon
this
particular
part
--
area,
whereas
the
defendant
does
not.
but
even
so,
i
would
think
that
there
is
no
standard
for
this
particular
county
because
even
in
that
case,
the
fine
or
the
costs
may
be
enforced
by
commitment
to
jail.
mr.
peter
hearn
yes,
sir.
i
--
mr.
peter
hearn
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
i
--
that
is
exactly
correct,
yes,
sir.
so
that
the
--
if
another
state
did
enact
a
statute
of
this
sort
with
which
to
abuse
acquitted
defendants,
i
think
that
it
is
entirely
possible
that
it
would
sweep
within
its
purview
perfectly
legal
and
even
constitutionally
protected
acts.
certainly,
in
the
areas
of
political
activity
or
civil
rights
demonstrations
or
the
like,
it
would
be
entirely
possible
for
a
jury
to
be
completely
out
of
sympathy
with
the
costs
which
the
defendant
espoused,
even
though
there
had
been
no
case
made
out
on
misdemeanor.
mr.
peter
hearn
none
that
i
know
of.
i
believe
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
pennsylvania
is
the
only
state.
the
vagueness
of
the
statute
permits
this
arbitrariness.
however,
there
are
further
and
additional
constitutional
infirmities
which
deal
with
its
implementation
at
trial.
here,
there
are
numerous
procedural
due
process
objections,
each
of
which
is
sufficient
to
render
the
act
unconstitutional,
but
taken
cumulatively,
they
leave
no
doubt.
initially,
there's
a
lack
of
requisite
notice
of
the
grounds
for
which
this
penalty
may
be
imposed.
the
defendant
has
no
idea,
only
the
costs
may
be
assessed.
the
only
hearing
is
the
hearing
on
the
misdemeanor
itself.
there
is
no
hearing
on
this
misconduct
charge.
therefore,
any
defendant
who
seeks
to
show
that
he
--
the
absence
of
misconduct
or
the
existence
of
good
conduct,
would
not
be
permitted
to
do
so.
the
basic
defense
is
further
prejudiced
by
the
fact
that
he
might
have
to
take
the
witness
stand
in
his
own
defense
merely
to
rebut
the
cost
possibility
whereas
otherwise
he
would
not.
and
under
pennsylvania
practice,
if
the
defendant
seeking
to
rebut
against
costs
offered
evidence
of
good
character,
the
prosecution
could
come
back
with
the
--
a
record
of
prior
convictions
which
it
would
not
be
otherwise
able
to
do.
so
that
the
--
the
defendant
is
forced
to
elect,
and
if
he
elects
to
defend
against
costs,
he
prejudices
his
defense
on
the
merit.
accordingly,
i
respectfully
request
that
this
court
reverse
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
and
hold
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional
insofar
as
if
it
--
as
it
is
applied
to
acquitted
the
defendants.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
hearn
i
have
no
rebuttal,
sir.
