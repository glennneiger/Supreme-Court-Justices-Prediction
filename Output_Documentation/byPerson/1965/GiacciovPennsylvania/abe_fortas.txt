justice
abe
fortas
if
a
--
excuse
me
sir.
if
the
misdemeanor
is
--
if
the
jury
has
waived
which
i
suppose
is
possible
under
pennsylvania
law
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
does
this
provision
still
obtain?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
you
not
only
have
a
time
for
misdemeanor
with
the
right
to
jury
trial,
but
you
actually
have
to
have
a
jury
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
but
during
--
mr.
hearn,
can
you
help
me
at
all
with
respect
to
the
reason
why
or
just
the
case
you
would
before
the
differentiation
between
the
misdemeanor
and
the
felony?
no.
mr.
halsted,
i
beg
your
pardon.
i'm
so
sorry.
justice
abe
fortas
why
did
the
--
why
the
statute
felony
on
this
too?
justice
abe
fortas
i
started
to
notice
that
the
statute
says
nothing
about
the
court
supervisor,
the
magistrate
supervisory
power
over
the
security
of
the
termination
of
the
cost.
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
know
whether
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
instances
--
in
the
instances
are
frequent
or
are
they
rare
where
the
magistrate
has
set
aside
the
jury
determination?
justice
abe
fortas
where
that's
been
set
aside.
justice
abe
fortas
because
statutes
says
that
the
--
after
the
jury
makes
its
determination
that
the
court
shall
forth
with
pass
sentence
to
that
effect.
justice
abe
fortas
and
there's
no
indication
of
any
standards
or
standards
of
review
or
standards
of
setting
to
decide
no
explicit
recognition
to
that.
justice
abe
fortas
the
statute
says
until
the
costs
are
paid
unless
he
gives
security.
statute
reads
as
if
it
were
indefinite
and
he
would
kept
in
jail
indefinitely?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
cited
in
your
brief?
