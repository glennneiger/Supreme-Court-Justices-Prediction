mr.
donald
f.
welday
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
we
present
a
case
wherein
--
as
we
have
recited
the
issue,
there
seems
to
be
some
difference
of
opinion
as
to
what
the
actual
issue
is
in
this
case
between
our
position,
the
position
of
the
respondents
and
that
of
the
solicitor
general.
but
we
think
that
we
have
accurately
phrased
it,
when
we
said
that
has
congress
in
enacting
the
national
labor
relations
act
exempted
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts,
all
rights
and
all
remedies
in
the
case
of
nonviolent
tortuous
conduct
even
though
there
maybe
--
committed
even
though
there
maybe
some
kind
of
a
labor
dispute
or
relations
or
incident
involved.
has
it
been
the
intent
of
congress
to
deprive
an
individual
of
his
right
of
action
for
tortuous
conduct
committed
against
him
in
the
state
courts
or
in
this
case,
a
federal
court
because
of
diversity
of
citizenship.
the
facts,
on
december
the
7th,
1962,
mr.
linn
who
is
the
petitioner
here,
was
an
assistant
regional
manager
for
the
pinkerton
national
detective
agency.
and
he
had
under
his
--
or
in
his
area
the
detroit,
michigan
area,
and
on
that
date,
december
7,
1962,
a
leaflet
was
published
and
delivered
to
various
employees
of
the
detroit
office
of
the
pinkerton
national
detective
agency.
in
that
leaflet,
mr.
linn
was
expressly
referred
to
by
a
name,
described
as
a
manager.
also
in
that
leaflet,
it
was
said
that
the
pinkerton
managers
have
been
lying,
have
been
cheating,
have
been
robbing,
and
perhaps
maybe
subject
to
criminal
penalties.
there
was
no
labor
relations
matter,
no
labor
dispute,
and
no
incident
up
to
that
point.
one
year
previously,
on
the
7th
of
december
in
1961,
there
had
been
a
certification
election
for
the
pinkerton
employees
in
the
detroit
office
--
the
bargaining
agent
which
had
represented
those
employees
up
to
that
point
was
voted
out.
so
on
december
the
7th,
1962,
when
this
leaflet
was
published,
there
was
no
problem,
there
was
no
dispute,
and
there
was
no
incident.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
it
was
said
in
the
circuit
court's
opinion
that
there
was
an
organizational
campaign.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
the
record
does
not
show.
we
don't
know.
now
it
has
been
alleged
here
in
the
facts,
in
the
respondent's
brief
that
this
was
an
organizational
campaign.
and
very
frankly,
we
don't
know
whether
there
was
an
organizational
campaign.
there
had
been
an
election
a
year
previously.
but
up
to
this
point,
--
insofar
as
we
know,
and
insofar
as
this
record
is
concerned,
there
had
been
no
organizational
campaign.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
no,
sir.
this
is
one
of
the
features
of
this
case,
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
in
it.
really,
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
we
can
present
evidence.
subsequent
to
the
circulation
of
this
leaflet,
which
contained
language
which
was
--
and
assumed
to
be
by
the
court
of
appeals,
clearly
libelous
insofar
as
the
petitioner
here
is
concerned,
the
petitioner's
employer
filed
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
detroit
office
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
now
the
petitioner
did
not,
of
course,
he
is
an
intermediate
supervisor
employee
of
the
pinkerton
detective
agency,
the
respondents
here
are
that
group
which
apparently
sought
to
represent
the
guard
employees
of
the
pinkerton
detective
agency.
but
the
pinkerton
agency
filed
an
unfair
labor
charge.
within
a
matter
of
a
few
days,
the
petitioner
here
filed
his
libel
action.
the
local
office
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
acting
upon
the
pinkerton,
the
employer's
application,
refused
to
issue
a
complaint.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
based
exclusively
on
the
leaflet
containing
the
defamatory
material
--
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
yes
sir.
he
was
specifically
mentioned
--
mr.
donald
f.
welday
pardon.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
the
leaflet
had
about
14
or
15
pages
and
in
one
place
--
mr.
donald
f.
welday
it
is
not
--
we
don't
describe
the
particular
place
in
the
complaint.
the
complaint
does
say
that
mr.
linn
was
elsewhere
named
in
the
leaflet.
i
have
the
leaflet
here.
i
can't
tell
the
court
exactly
where
it
appears.
the
complaint
says
that
he
was
named.
and
the
complaint
was
it
--
or
the
leaflet
was
attached
to
the
complaint
as
an
exhibit.
what
we
recited
specifically
was
the
language
used
which
we
claimed
was
libelous
reciting
that
it
referred
to
--
the
language
said
the
managers
have
been
doing
this.
mr.
linn
was
otherwise
and
elsewhere
named
as
a
manager
and
we
attached
the
entire
leaflet
to
the
complaint
as
an
exhibit.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
i
don't
see
that
it
was
printed
in
the
record,
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
what
--
well,
i
don't
think
really,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
mr.
linn
was
otherwise
named
has
ever
been
raised
either
in
the
court
of
appeals,
certainly
not
in
the
district
court,
not
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
it
has
never
been
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not,
linn
was
in
fact
named
in
the
complaint.
i
think
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
welday
no,
it
is
--
mr.
donald
f.
welday
it
is
not
in
this
record.
no,
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
now,
you're
speaking
about
paragraph
five
of
the
complaint
on
page
four
of
the
record,
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
the
entire
circular?
mr.
donald
f.
welday
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
the
whole
circular
was
submitted
as
an
exhibit
to
the
complaint
in
the
district
court.
my
recollection,
i
don't
recall
whether
it
was
certified
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
their
considerations.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
it
is
in
the
district
court
record.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
pardon.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
i
don't'
know
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
i
can
certainly
furnish
a
copy
of
the
entire
record
or
of
the
circular
which
ever,
your
honor,
would
desire.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
i
appreciate
that,
sir,
and
i'll
see
to
it
that
that
if
that
complaint
or
--
excuse
me,
if
that
circular
is
made
available.
but
again,
i
say
that
it
is
--
there
has
been
no
question
about
what
mr.
linn
was
in
fact
described
elsewhere
in
this
circular
as
being
one
of
the
managers.
factually
then,
if
i
might
go
on,
the
national
labor
relations
board,
the
local
office
in
detroit,
refused
to
issue
a
complaint
on
the
pinkerton
complaint,
finding
certain
facts,
finding
as
a
fact
that
the
respondents
here
had
no
part
in
the
preparation
of
this
libelous
material.
now
the
national
labor
relations
board
did
not
have
a
hearing.
they
made
this
finding
of
facts
after
some
kind
of
an
investigatory
process.
an
appeal
was
taken
from
that
to
the
general
council
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
and
he
sustained
the
local
opinion
not
to
issue
a
complaint.
now
these
things
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court.
we
feel
that
they
had
really
no
part
in
the
lawsuit
filed
by
the
petitioner
here.
but
nevertheless
they
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court.
also,
a
motion
was
made
to
the
district
court
to
dismiss
the
petitioner's
action
on
the
now
familiar
garmon
language
that
if
an
activity
is
arguably
subject
to
section
7
or
8
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
it
is
preempted
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
the
local
courts
would
have
no
jurisdiction.
and
it
was
specifically,
on
that
ground,
that
the
district
court
dismissed
the
petitioner's
complaint
was
no
hearing
was
ever
held
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
or
before
the
district
court
the
truth
of
falsity
of
the
allegations.
the
libelous
material
has
never
been
gone
into.
it
has
never
been
pursued
at
all.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
it
never
can
be
under
the
district
court's
opinion
in
this
case.
when
the
complaint
was
filed,
it
was
filed
against
the
union,
its
two
principal
officers,
and
another
man
by
the
name
of
doyle.
and
the
allegation
was
that
they
acted
in
concert
in
preparation
of
this
libelous
material.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
no,
this
is
the
complaint
before
the
district
court.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
this
is
the
lawsuit.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
the
pinkerton
people
filed
a
complaint
before
the
board.
this
petitioner
did
not
and
could
not
as
a
--
mr.
donald
f.
welday
he
was
the
acting
or
the
--
yes,
the
acting
district
manager
in
detroit.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
he
receives
orders
in
his
headquarters
or
the
people
that
tell
him
what
to
do
or
in
new
york
city.
he's
not
autonomous
by
any
means.
and
the
action
was
taken
through
the
direction
of
his
home
office
in
new
york
city.
and
he
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
filing
of
the
complaint
before
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
no,
sir,
not
at
all.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
yes,
requests
were
made
by
the
local
national
labor
relations
board
of
a
written
statement
of
the
respective
positions
of
the
pinkerton
people
who
had
filed
the
charge
and
the
union
as
a
respondent
to
it.
insofar
as
i
know,
no
other
investigation
was
undertaken
by
the
board.
certainly,
nothing
was
done
insofar
as
this
petitioner
is
concerned.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
doyle,
who
was
the
last
named
defendant
in
the
original
lawsuit,
was
not
dismissed
from
the
case.
he
did
not
join
in
the
motion
to
dismiss.
and
the
order
of
the
district
court
dismissing
the
lawsuit
as
to
the
defendant
union
and
its
officers
specifically
said
that
the
--
with
dismissal
of
the
other
defendants,
i'm
reading
from
page
37
of
the
record
in
the
district
court's
opinion.
with
dismissal
of
the
other
defendants,
both
suits
are
reduced
to
simple
common
law
tort
actions.
local
114
has
disclaimed
any
responsibility
for
the
activities
of
defendant,
doyle,
and
this
disclaimer
has
been
upheld
by
both
the
regional
director
and
the
office
of
appeals
of
the
nlrb.
if
as
alleged,
defendant
doyle
libel
pinkerton's
or
linn,
this
is
a
private
matter
which
may
aptly
be
resolved
in
this
court
if
usual
jurisdictional
requirements
have
been
satisfied.
we
find
that
curious.
we
can't
really
understand
one;
how
the
principle
of
garmon
which
was
relied
on
by
the
district
court
would
be
applicable
to
the
respondents
here
and
not
applicable
to
doyle.
and
number
two,
we
find
it
interesting
that
the
district
court
apparently
adopted
as
findings
of
fact
for
its
use
and
which
would
govern
the
petitioner
here,
those
things
which
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
found
in
a
matter
involving
the
petitioner's
employer
and
these
respondents,
where
this
petitioner
never
had
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
so
really
what
we
have
--
mr.
donald
f.
welday
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
it
was
an
--
yes
sir,
it
was
an
administrative
finding.
it
was
not
a
board
finding.
it
was
a
--
the
reason
for
not
issuing
the
complaint
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
yes
sir,
by
the
regional
director.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
and
confirmed
by
the
general
counsel.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
he
was
a
pinkerton
guard.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
may
understand
--
mr.
donald
f.
welday
that
during
the
times
aforesaid,
the
defendants
which
would
be
the
--
all
of
the
respondents
here
and
doyle
did
conspire
to
maliciously
publish
of
unconcerning
plaintiff
by
mailing
and
circulating.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
that's
yes
--
yes,
you're
right.
you're
right.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
i
don't
think
they
came
to
the
first
question
but
the
second
proposition
which
we
put,
i
think
is
what
the
regional
director
did
--
conclusion.
he
did
come
to
--
that
there
was
no
connection
between
the
union
and
doyle.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
nothing
before
this
court,
no
sir.
i
might
--
so
i
don't
completely
give
up
the
point,
paragraph
four
of
our
complaint
which
is
recited
on
page
four
of
the
record
that
all
of
the
defendants
named
in
the
complaint
did
conspire
to
libel
and
defame
plaintiff.
i
suppose
that
if
i
had
to
argue,
i
would
say
that
that
--
that
language
and
that
pleading
i
now
candidly
concede
it's
not
the
best.
but
i
would
argue
at
an
appropriate
point
that
it
could
be
used
to
allege
that
the
union
people
did
participate
in
the
preparation
of
the
libelous
material.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
--
law
which
--
mr.
donald
f.
welday
under
the
--
mr.
donald
f.
welday
well,
yes
as
a
--
certainly
as
an
aider
and
abettor
than
a
conspirator
in
the
perpetration
of
what
is
in
effect
crime
in
the
state
of
michigan,
not
in
effect
with
this
--
by
statute,
a
crime
in
the
state
of
michigan.
aiding
and
abetting
in
the
conspiracy
would
all
make
everyone
libel
as
principles
whether
it
be
just
published
or
whether
they
all
set
down
at
the
big
table
and
grafted
this
material.
the
upshot
of
the
district
court's
position
left
this
plaintiff
in
a
position
where
he
felt
that
he
had
been
libel
with
malice
grievously
and
there
was
absolutely
nothing
that
he,
as
an
individual,
could
do
about
it.
the
court
said
that
under
garmon,
the
court
can't
do
anything
about
it.
the
national
labor
relations
board
wouldn't
hear
the
complaint
of
this
petitioner's
employer
and
we
point
out
that
even
if
they
had
agreed
to
hear
it,
there
wasn't
a
thing
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
could
do
under
any
circumstances
to
restore
this
citizen
and
this
individual
to
a
position
where
he
would
have
been
before
he
suffered
a
personal
injury.
and
we
submit
that
libel
is
a
personal
injury,
that
it's
a
serious
one,
and
that
it's
a
grievous
one.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court's
action
specifically
on
this
court's
opinion
in
garmon
and
pointed
out
the
interesting
proposition,
as
the
sixth
circuit
interpreted
it.
garmon
says,
an
individual
might
quickly
recover
from
the
--
i
interpolate
somewhat,
an
individual
might
quickly
recover
from
the
bruises
and
wounds
of
a
physical
assault
and
that
little
expense
have
a
crimpled
fender
bumped
out.
but
a
lifetime
may
not
be
sufficient
to
restore
a
reputation
hurt
by
the
circulation
of
a
vicious
libel.
we
are
persuaded
however,
that
garmon
has
drawn
the
distinction
which
permits
the
one
to
be
remedied
by
traditional
court
action
and
limits
the
other
to
the
relief,
if
any,
that
may
come
from
an
order
of
the
nlrb.
and
if
a
regional
director's
refusal
to
issue
a
complaint
is
sustained,
the
libeled
individual
is
at
the
end
of
the
remedial
role.
mr.
linn
is
at
the
end
of
the
remedial
role
under
this
interpretation
of
garmon.
very
frankly,
mr.
linn
doesn't
like
that
situation
and
he
feels
that
there
must
be
some
place
where
the
truth
can
be
established.
is
mr.
linn
a
crook
and
is
he
a
liar,
and
is
he
a
thief?
does
he
have
to
go
through
life
because
of
national
labor
policy
branded
this
way?
or
may
he
not,
in
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
refute
these
allegations,
and
may
he
not
clear
his
name.
we
think
that
in
some
respects,
this
case
raises
the
issue
which
was
suggested
and
foretold
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
garmon
and
also
suggested
in
mr.
justice
douglas'
dissent
in
the
borden
case.
that
is,
has
congress
prevented
a
resolution
by
the
courts,
what
is
essentially
a
private
dispute,
a
personal
injury
tort?
when
that
dispute
incidentally
arises
during
the
course
of
what
might
be
called
the
labor
relations
incident.
when
we
say
it
might
be
called
a
labor
relations
incident,
because
in
this
case
particularly,
there
was
no
incident,
there
was
no
dispute.
there
was
nothing.
people
went
to
work
and
all
of
a
sudden,
there
was
a
circular
distributed.
curiously
enough
by
following
garmon,
the
national
policy
which
we
think
is
to
promote
the
peaceful
settlement
of
labor
problems
if
we
promote
or
if
we
allow
garmon,
the
interpretation
of
garmon
that
was
attached
by
the
lower
courts
in
this
case,
then
we've
created
the
dispute
where
none
existed.
if
we
say
that
libel
is
an
activity
which
nothing
--
no
court
can
remedy,
which
no
court
can
hear
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
maybe
might
do
something
about
it,
then
in
effect,
we
give
a
license
to
libel.
we
create
disputes
and
we
think
in
some
respects
that
the
position
of
the
respondents
here
isn't
asking
for
a
license
to
libel.
because
the
practical
issue
has
to
be
faced
that
no
order
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
could
do
anything
about
can
possibly
correct
or
stop
that
pass
line.
ultimately,
it
may
say
don't
ever
libel
again.
don't
ever
defame
again.
but
it
can't
do
anything
about
what
has
transpired
in
the
past.
and
we
think
this
is
a
license.
we
think
this
creates
a
dispute
where
none
has
existed.
the
answer
to
whether
or
not
libel
may
be
prosecuted
even
though
there
is
a
labor
incident
attached
to
it,
the
answer
to
that
question,
we
think,
comes
from
the
dissenting
opinion
of
the
chief
justice
in
the
russell
case,
commenting
on
the
laburnum
case.
laburnum
simply
holds
that
a
tort-feasor
should
not
be
allowed
to
immunize
himself
from
liability
for
a
wrong
having
no
relation
to
federal
law
simply
because
the
means
he
adopts
to
affect
the
wrong,
transgresses
a
comprehensive
code
of
federal
regulation.
and
that
i
think
in
a
nutshell
is
the
situation
here.
the
tort-feasor
has
committed
a
wrong
which
incidentally
is
involved
with
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
national
code.
but
otherwise,
it
has
no
connection
to
it.
it's
essentially
a
private
dispute
between
linn
on
the
one
hand
and
those
people
who
happened
to
be
connected
with
a
labor
union
on
the
other
hand.
i
think
there
is
no
possibility
of
a
competition
between
the
courts
in
this
matter
and
the
national
labor
relations
board.
they're
looking
for
two
separate
and
distinct
approaches.
the
board's
approach
is,
does
a
given
circumstance,
does
a
given
incident,
is
it
coercive?
not
truth.
that's
not
the
issue
before
the
board.
is
it
coercive?
the
court
is
concerned
with
the
truth
regardless
of
whether
it
is
coercive
or
not
coercive.
it
makes
no
difference.
these
two
tribunals
then
are
looking
in
different
directions.
they
can
decide
these
issues.
they
can
hear
these
issues
without
any
relationship
to
each
other,
without
any
competition
between
each
other.
and
if
the
problem,
if
the
reason
for
the
preemption
doctrine
of
garmon
which
is
what
has
controlled
this
case
so
far
is
a
prevention
of
competition
between
the
national
policy
and
the
various
substantive
laws
and
modes
of
regulation
of
the
several
states.
that
competition
problem
is
not
present
under
this
set
of
circumstances
because
the
tribunals
are
not
looking
towards
the
same
answer.
the
fourth
circuit,
in
the
bouligny
case
which
we
understand
is
before
this
court
but
on
another
question,
but
the
fourth
circuit
summed
up
we
think,
the
whole
proposition
in
one
neat
little
sentence.
the
question
before
it
in
part
was
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court
to
hear
a
libel
permit
or
committed
in
the
course
of
some
kind
of
a
labor
incident.
and
the
fourth
circuit
said
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
concerned
only
with
the
coercive
effect
and
it
is
not
concerned
at
all
with
the
effect
of
libel
as
a
common
law
tort.
that's
what
we're
concerned
with
here.
and
mr.
linn
says,
this
petitioner
says,
can
i
clear
my
name?
can
i
have
this
matter
heard?
i
don't
think
it
is
any
answer
to
say
but
the
matter
will
still
be
heard
in
relation
to
the
remaining
defendant
doyle
because,
if
we
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
we
try
the
matter
insofar
as
doyle
is
concerned
and
if
we
prove
everything
which
we
have
alleged
in
our
complaint.
and
this
case
is
the
--
the
decisions
are
allowed
to
stand
as
they
are
up
to
this
point,
then
we
approve
the
complete
defense
of
mr.
doyle
because
he's
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
union
and
he
is
in
concert
with
him
and
garmon
would
preempt
the
action.
so
it
is
no
answer
to
say
that
the
matter
still
remains
viable
insofar
as
doyle
is
concerned.
we
are
--
mr.
donald
f.
welday
that's
correct
and
you
--
mr.
donald
f.
welday
no
but
we
alleged
that
they
acted
in
concert.
now
--
mr.
donald
f.
welday
well
i
appreciate
that,
sir,
but
would
it
not
also
create
the
same
kind
of
a
defense
that
the
garmon
rule
has
created
so
far.
that's
why
i
say
if
we
go
back
and
prove
everything
which
we've
alleged
in
our
complaint,
we
are
very
likely
to
be
met
with
the
same
defense.
and
suppose
we
go
back
and
try
the
case
against
doyle
and
he
says,
“ah,
but
i'm
going
to
prove
that
i
wasn't
member
of
the
union.
doyle
hasn't
been
heard
from
either.
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
made
this
finding
on
what
evidence
we
don't
know,
just
a
disclaimer
is
not
going
to
resolve
the
issue
in
the
district
court.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
i
think,
we
can
let
the
court
hear
that
question
in
the
first
instance.
that's
what
we
want
to
do.
that's
what
we're
appealing.
can
the
court
hear
this?
mr.
donald
f.
welday
no,
i'm
afraid
i
can't
agree
with
you.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
well,
but
the
question
before
the
court
here
is
not
whether
john
smith
did
it.
it's
whether
or
not
we
can
go
into
court
and
prove
that
the
union
did
it.
insofar
as
mr.
linn
is
concerned,
the
individual
who
some
place
in
the
middle
between
the
worker
down
here
and
the
employer
up
here,
he
stands
in
the
middle.
now
what
can
he
do?
can
he
file
a
lawsuit
alleging
that
the
union
and
its
officers
libeled
him
and
somebody
else
too,
maybe
a
whole
group
of
people.
that
doesn't
make
any
difference.
we're
concerned
only
with
the
part
in
it
that
the
union
is
playing
and
the
district
court
said,
“no,
you
mr.
linn,
cannot
do
this
because
the
act
says
that
you're
an
employer
by
definition,
even
though
you're
just
a
supervisor
and
you
have
to
take
directions
too.
so
you
can't
do
this.
you
must
get
whatever
relief
you
can
get
from
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
says
and
they
can't
give
you
any.”
and
as
a
practical
matter,
mr.
linn
has
no
right
to
go
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
only
if
he
can
persuade
his
employer
to
file
a
complaint.
and
the
board
will
hear
it.
so
he
is
in
a
real
state
of
limbo
insofar
as
this
circumstance
is
concerned.
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
--
mr.
donald
f.
welday
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
company,
the
employer
filed
a
similar
libel
action
against
the
same
defendants
and
respondents
and
that
was
dismissed
in
the
district
court
and
no
appeal
from
that
was
ever
taken.
we
concede
that
that
is
a
far
different
case,
yes.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
yes
sir.
although
he
is
not
really
a
stranger,
he
is
a
part
of
the
managerial
staff.
but
in
effect
he
--
mr.
donald
f.
welday
of
the
employer.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
yes
sir,
in
a
supervisory
capacity.
and
because
he
is
a
supervisor,
under
the
definitions
of
the
act,
he
is
the
employer,
whereas
in
effect
and
in
practical
matter,
he's
some
place
between
the
man
on
the
bottom
and
the
man
at
the
top
but
he
is
by
definition
an
employer.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
not
under
this
peculiar
circumstances
where
it
is
alleged
that
he
is
maliciously
and
deliberately
libeled.
and
it
is
his
reputation,
not
the
company's,
it
is
his
personal
reputation
which
is
challenged.
and
that
is
our
position.
when
that
happens,
then
it's
essentially
a
private
dispute.
and
when
that
happens,
he
should,
regardless
of
whatever
garmon
has
said,
have
the
right
and
access
to
the
courts.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
we
have
in
our
brief
said
that
the
libel
is
not
protected
by
section
7
nor
is
it
prohibited
under
section
8.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
this
is
correct
but
garmon
also
says
may
fairly
be
asserted
is
words
in
place
of
arguably,
may
it
fairly
be
asserted.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
it
is
not
and
it
may
not
fairly
be
asserted
that
it
is.
section
7
and
its
legislative
history
demonstrates
that
no
unlawful
activity
is
a
protected
activity.
and
no
standard
definition
of
unlawful
activity
is
given
in
the
act
or
in
the
section
7.
therefore,
i
would
assume
that
what
we
generally
conceive
under
the
definitions
of
the
several
states
as
unlawful
activity
must
be
what
is
meant
in
section
7.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
a
few
moments
remaining.
i
would
like
to
correct
an
earlier
impression
made
in
response
of
the
question
by
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
doubled
check
my
own
record,
sir,
during
the
recess
period.
the
circular
was
not
filed
with
the
complaint.
it
was
held
as
ultimately
and
potentially
exhibiting
the
matter.
my
own
mistake
was
it
was
filed
with
the
nlrb
by
the
employer.
it
was
not
filed
with
the
complaint
and
he's
not
in
any
part
of
the
record
of
this
suit.
i
would
like
to
stress
that
what
this
suit
is
involved
and
that
--
it
is
the
suit
of
an
individual
not
an
employer
except
as
he
is
defined
and
categorized
an
employer.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
a
semantic
problem
which
i
have,
there
was
nothing
insofar
as
either
this
petitioner
was
concerned
nor
his
employer.
the
first
time
that
it
appears
is
the
self
serving
statement
of
the
respondent
in
this
--
mr.
donald
f.
welday
what
trial
it
has
been,
yes.
that's
it
--
mr.
donald
f.
welday
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
there
wasn't.
i
did
mean
to
suggest
that
there
wasn't
--
there
was
nothing
to
suggest
a
dispute
as
we
understand
that
term.
i
don't
know.
it's
been
assumed
here
that
there
would
be
a
--
not
on
drag
on
fight.
and
i
don't
know
that
we
can
make
that
assumption.
i
would
like
also
to
say
that
all
the
tests
which
have
been
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general,
by
the
respondent,
and
by
garmon,
insofar
as
the
solicitor
general's
test
of
--
is
concerned,
we
think
that
the
questions
posed
by
the
court
demonstrate
that
the
severity
part
of
it
or
the
grave
part
of
it
or
the
nasty
part
of
it,
is
actually
unworkable.
frankly,
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
we
could
accept
a
test
of
malice
or
deliberate
false
suit
insofar
as
allowing
the
state
courts
to
retain
jurisdiction
is
concerned.
if
this
is
a
retreat
from
our
position
that
all
actions
for
libel
under
these
circumstances
should
be
maintained,
then
we
retreat
to
that
point
when
the
allegation
is
--
that
there
is
a
deliberate
or
a
malicious,
or
knowingly
false
statement
made,
we
think
that
that
perhaps
maybe
a
workable
test.
the
relevancy
test
suggested
or
the
arguably
subject
test
--
mr.
donald
f.
welday
well
the
solicitor
general
adds
to
it.
his
is
not
a
malicious
or
grave
--
as
i
understood
his
test,
it
was
malicious
and
grave.
and
i
don't
think
that
you
can
use
that
gravity
test
any
place.
i
think
it's
just
too
hard
to
work.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
i,
personally
would
have
no
objection
because
and
particularly
in
the
context
of
this
case
where
some
form
to
provide
the
truth
is
what
the
petitioner
seeks
here.
and
this
is
what's
been
denied
in.
he
has
no
place
to
go
to
establish
that
he
is
not
a
crook,
not
a
liar,
and
not
a
theft,
not
a
robber.
and
this
is
what
he
wants.
and
this
is
what's
been
deprived
because
his
employer
did
something
on
one
hand
and
the
union
made
the
statement
on
the
other
hand.
he's
left
out
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
with
no
ores.
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
contrary
to
what
we
are
--
what
this
country
is
building
around.
these
people
are
entitled
to
maintain
their
reputations
arguably
subject
the
test
that's
suggested
in
the
garmon
is
fine
if
you
can
compel
the
labor
board
to
hear
these
matters
in
the
first
place
but
you
can't.
they
can
refuse
to
entertain
the
complaint
or
refuse
to
hear
the
matter.
so
if
we
let
the
labor
board
say
whether
or
not
it
is
arguably
subject,
i
would
think
we'd
have
to
say
that
the
labor
board
must
make
that
determination
but
it
doesn't.
the
garmon
test
actually
provides
three
exceptions,
one
for
violence,
one
for
activities
which
are
peripheral
concerns
of
the
labor
management
act,
and
an
exception
in
the
case
of
compelling
state
interests.
the
deliberate
or
malicious
libel
is
much
like
violence
in
that
it
is
an
intentional
means
of
destruction
or
something
else
now
whether
it
happens
to
be
a
car
or
a
building
or
an
arm
or
a
client
relationship,
or
a
reputation
it
still
is
an
intentional
destruction.
we
think
that
it
corresponds
to
violence.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
i
think
it
would.
i
think
when
you
call
a
man
a
thief
and
you
call
him
a
robber,
it's
grave.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
the
men
were
robbed
for
pay
increases.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
call
it
whether
what
you
will,
he's
a
thief
or
a
robber.
mr.
donald
f.
welday
i
think
it
would.
thank
you
gentlemen.
