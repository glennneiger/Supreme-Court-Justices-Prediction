justice
william
o.
douglas
i've
noticed
on
page
five
of
the
record,
paragraph
six
that
the
complaint
alleges
that
plaintiff
is
and
was
one
of
the
managers
referred
to.
justice
william
o.
douglas
now
those
managers
are
the
ones
described
in
paragraph
five,
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
--
is
the
circular
that
is
quoted
in
paragraph
five
of
the
complaint
in
the
record?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
you
quote
they
are
now
that
we
find
out
pinkerton
had
a
large
volume
of
work
and
so
on.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
quoted
--
is
that
in
the
record
the
whole
circular?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
it's
in
the
district
court
records.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
record
here?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
record
here?
justice
william
o.
douglas
could
you
see
that
it
gets
here?
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh
we
would
only
go
on
what
--
what
was
before
the
district
court.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
your
department,
mr.
solicitor
general
considered
whether
or
not,
were
to
feel
now,
it
is
companion
field
or
the
same
field,
as
new
york
times
versus
sullivan.
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course
that's
the
whole
philosophy
of
new
york
times
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
violence
isn't
free
the
speech.
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course,
if
you're
right
on
the
philosophy
of
the
new
york
times
case
you're
not
bothered
with
this
question
of
preemption.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
wasn't
one
of
the
cases.
