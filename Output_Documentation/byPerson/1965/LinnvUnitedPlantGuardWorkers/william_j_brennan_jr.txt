if
i
understand
you'd
say

if
this
is
not
serious

justice
william
j.
brennan,

(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

to
say
that
the
state
could
not
provide
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
remedy
you
like.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
i
gather
you
say
the
words
what
the
--
characterizes
serious
then.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

by
default
could
be
applied

justice
william
j.
brennan,

not
punitive

justice
william

only
compensatory
damages
and
only
annoying
and
reckless
falsity
where

alleged

serious.

that's
not
the
board's
finding

but
the
board,
they

results
of
the

it's
arguably
decided
on

exclusively
that
more

can't
move
anywhere
in

it
isn't
it
not
a

determination,
it's
a

the
state
has
now

and
jurisdiction
and
whether
anything
that
happens
to
the
board,
nothing
or
whatever
may
happen
and
if
it's
arguably
within
the

yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well
i'm
just
wondering
how
wrong
i
am.
these
things
start
out
of
the
heat
of
these
campaigns
but
once
the
union
wins
and
they
sit
down
to
bargain
collectively,
then
the
dismissed
is
the
--
is
around
critical
spies.
