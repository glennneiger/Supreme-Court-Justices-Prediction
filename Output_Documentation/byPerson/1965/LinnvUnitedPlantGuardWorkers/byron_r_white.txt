was
there
an
organizing
campaign?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
evidence
on
this
campaign?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
charge
was
based
entirely
and
exclusively
on
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
somebody
not
through
any
intentional
violence
but
simply
through
negligence,
why
does
somebody
get
kicked
him
and
his
leg
is
broken,
do
you
think
garmon
will
hold
that
he
has
no
right
of
action
against
the
organizer
who
negligently
kicked
him
them
and
broke
his
leg?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
violence,
i
say
by
hypothesis,
no
violence,
i
mean,
no
intentional
violence
at
all,
just
a
negligence.
justice
byron
r.
white
garmon.
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
say
about
a
touching
tort,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
what
you've
told
is
what
you
--
part
of
your
version
of
what
this
court
decided,
there
wouldn't
be
no
right
of
action
for
that
kind
of
a
negligent
tort.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
can
by
my
--
i'm
inventing
this
case
and
maybe
it
will
never
happen
but
by
hypothesis,
it
does.
it's
in
the
course
of
picketing
or
of
an
organizing
campaign,
or
by
my
hypothesis,
it
has
--
it's
in
the
course
of
something
that's
protected
or
arguably
protected
or
prohibited
by
the
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me,
this
is
your
point
here.
that
you
are
suggesting
that
the
bringing
of
this
suit
violates
the
labor
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now
the
solicitor
general
referred
us
to
that
statement
in
an
affidavit
that
this
was
in
the
context
of
an
organizational
campaign.
you,
i
think
told
me
earlier
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
it's
one
of
the
facts
this
whole
case
has
been
tried
in
an
affidavit.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
but
there
hasn't
--
the
whole
--
i
don't
mean
tried.
but
in
the
context
that's
here
do
not
we
take
it
in
the
context
of
a
labor
organization
campaign.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
far
are
you
on
the
solicitor
general
part?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
suggestion
solicitor
general
made
that
within
an
elimination
of
punitive
damages.
