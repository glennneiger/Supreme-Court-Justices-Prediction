if
you
get
one
dictionary
then,
who's
going
to
draw
that
dictionary
words?
justice

l.
black
who
would
decide?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
courts
would
decide
whether
there
was
serious
that
have
to
come
under
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
serious
enough
the
court
would
decide
--
justice

l.
black
state
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
that
would
define
the
labor
board
of
any
chance
in
the
outset
to
preserve
the
jurisdiction
over
that,
wouldn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
state
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
a
pretty
bad
mix,
wouldn't
it?
justice

l.
black
may
i
ask
in
connection
that
--
justice
hugo

black
--
replacement
about
the
new
york
times
but
we
said
in
thornhill,
i
thought
of
thornhill
which
had
never
been
impaired
in
this
date
and
i
repeat
that
a
number
of
other
cases
that
in
a
circumstances
or
valid
times
the
discretion
of
matters
in
connection
to
the
labor
dispute
to
be
considered
the
same
as
all
other
questions
affecting
public
affairs.
now
if
that's
the
case,
would
it
be
necessary
to
protect
your
right
to
speak
here
in
connection
with
these
elections,
the
same
as
it
would
be
a
voter's
right
to
speak,
on
official
right
to
somebody
to
criticize
the
officials?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
of
course
i
think
as
you
rather
graphically
stated
at
the
beginning,
we
have
to
realize
that
these
labor
disputes
general
rules
of
the
like
conversation
are
thrown
away
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
there
are
many
abused
many
serious
guide
was
made
all
of
the
time,
what
effect
would
it
have,
if
every
time
one
of
them
makes
a
serious
charge
whatever
a
serious
charge
is.
if
they
can
hold
a
union
liable
for
damages,
would
that
likely
foster
the
peace
of
tranquility
of
the
relationship
between
them
and
would
it
permit
labor
unions
to
survive
or
would
they
be
destroyed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
be
maintained?
he
might
have
decided
--
he's
underestimated
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
as
i
understand
you,
if
this
pamphlet
it
said
and
in
addition
to
this,
mr.
so
and
so,
robbed
the
bank
20
years
ago.
do
you
feel
that
that
would
be
libelous
and
--
and
could
be
--
would
be
actionable
even
though
it
occurred
in
the
course
of
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
who've
been
deciding
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
has
been
deciding
that
you're
going
to
let
that
be
tried
out
in
the
state
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
all
the
man
has
to
do
is
to
be
able
to
forecast
precisely
what
is
serious
then
he
can
file
a
suit,
that's
the
only
protection
you're
asking?
if
it's
forecasted
correctly,
what
is
serious
enough,
then
he
can
go
ahead
and
try
a
suit,
it's
not
arguably
to
be
heard
by
the
labor
relations
board,
you
go
ahead
and
try
this
suit
and
get
some
damage.
of
course,
he
hit
it
right
on
whether
how
serious
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
you'd
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
use
word
gross.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
used
the
word
that
kind
of
a
gross
charge,
most
might
have
heard
in
those
kind
of
thing
as
i
had
--
you
could
either
excuse
for
them
for
--
it
sounded
pretty
gross
to
me
charges
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
charge
made
that
you
will
not
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
you
mean
the
president
of
it
is
that
there
agent
has
been
convicted
of
robbery
at
several
times
you
can't
trust
the
union,
it
has
a
man
like
that.
would
you
say
that
has
no
relevance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh
did
he
said
about
the
employer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
to
the
relevance
of
the
same
statement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
as
i
said,
you
can't
believe
this
man,
his
employer,
his
superintendent
but
you
can't
believe
him.
he's
been
convicted
a
half
a
dozen
times
a
very
serious
crime,
would
that
be
relevant?
therefore
you
can't
believe
what
he's
telling
you
about
this.
i'm
just
pointing
this
out
because
i
--
frankly,
for
myself,
i
can't
in
fact
get
completely
your
idea
that
you're
going
to
decide
whether
or
not
it's
relevant.
it
might
be
hard
to
tell
what's
relevant
to
figure
this
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
think
garmon
laws
that
if
the
thing
is
arguably
but
the
board
and
it
seemed
to
me
like
that
the
very
argument
you're
making
which
you
seem
to
break
as
far
as
the
government's
argument
that
if
it's
not
serious,
if
you
get
–
somebody
get
to
decide
whether
it's
serious
or
not,
it
seems
to
me
like
that
very
argument,
both
of
your
points
rather
than
the
effect
that
garmon
should
apply
because
it
would
be
arguably
for
the
board
to
determine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
going
to
be
determining
line,
who
should
determine
that
line
the
state
of
the
labor
board?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
with
the
labor
board
and
we're
to
adopt
the
rule
like
that.
well,
i
wouldn't
have
the
proper
rule
to
be
the
same
or
you
can
finish
this
damage
suit,
you
got
to
go
to
the
labor
board
and
get
this
question
of
which
it
has
primary
jurisdiction
decided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
any
charges
that
they
can
make
for
the
reference
of
defamation
and
suppose
its
language
that
the
labor
board
shouldn't
pass
on
it
before
submitted
to
a
court
in
a
jury
in
the
state
court
to
determine
whether
it
falls
on
that
line.
justice
hugo
l.
black
wanting
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
some
conduct
of
question
a
lot
of
people
consider
worst
than
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
nobody
said
anything
about
what's
going
to
happen
with
the
reference
to
the
suit.
you
argued
it
on
the
theory
that
somehow
the
suit
can
go
on
--
can
be
tried
on
the
state
court
even
though
nobody
yet
know,
if
whether
it's
of
the
nature
that
the
board
has
jurisdiction
of.
nobody
has
mentioned
the
fact
to
what
you
do
to
get
that
primary
fact
determined.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
justice
brennan's
question
pointed
out
the
reason
i
was
asking
you
what
that
was.
your
position
and
that
of
the
government
seems
to
me
that
what
we
should
decide
is,
that
well
there's
some
that
the
board
had
and
some
it
doesn't
have.
any
serious
and
whether
there's
not
–-
somebody
got
to
decide
that
but
you
go
ahead
and
try
to
the
state
court,
i
understood
the
garmon
doctrine
and
all
the
other
cases
along
the
other
line,
but
to
the
effect
if
you
didn't
leave
things
like
that
to
be
tried
in
the
state
court
that
it
would
arguably
before
the
board
is
there
and
that
finished
the
case,
decided
it
permanently,
the
state
couldn't
proceed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
they
decided.
