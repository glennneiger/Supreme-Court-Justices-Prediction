mr.
thurgood
marshall
which
substantial
sums
have
been
sought
in
defamation
suits
growing
out
of
statements
made
doing
labor
disputes.
now
this
will
give
you
an
idea
of
importance
of
the
issue
because
these
suits
seem
to
be
a
relatively
new
phenomenon
in
racial
--
i
mean
in
labor
relations.
but
that
tendency
to
discourage
vigorous
organizational
campaigns
is
obvious.
significantly
many
of
these
suits
set
out
in
our
appendix
involve
words
which
although
probably
defamatory
under
traditional
criteria
of
libel
and
slander
cases,
nevertheless
cannot
fairly
be
said
seriously
to
injure
the
reputation
of
the
parties
to
a
labor
dispute.
claims
that
an
employer
is
unfair
or
that
is
using
the
big
live
tactics
of
hitler,
or
then
an
employee
is
by
hiding
tax,
and
draw
him
into
driveway.
let
me
point
out,
that
most
american
jurisdiction,
the
law
of
defamation
is
quite
strict.
casual
use
of
the
words
like
liar
or
cheat,
or
unfair
may
expose
one
to
heavy
general
damages,
even
though
actual
injury
to
one's
pocket
book
may
not
be
proved.
it
is
the
board
and
this
court
has
recognized
union
organizing
campaigns
tend
to
be
heated
affairs
in
which
the
participants
would
get
themselves
and
speak
intemperately.
indeed,
i
imagine
some
of
us
know
some
labor
leaders
that
if
you
prevent
him
from
cursing,
you
take
all
that
free
speech
away
from
them
and
a
negotiation
that
goes
on.
and
it's
recognized
its
feelings
run
high
rough
languages
not
in
frequent.
such
campaigns
of
organizing
in
a
labor
dispute,
they're
not
conducted
in
the
language
of
the
college
classroom
or
the
drawing
room.
words
and
other
context
might
constitute
serious
insults
are
generally
viewed
by
the
participants
in
labor
disputes
as
no
more
than
ordinary
rough
and
tumbled
organizing
tactics.
unfortunately,
many
courts
apparently
have
not
recognized
this
fact
of
industrialized
so
that
if
the
courts
were
permitted
to
apply
the
traditional
strict
standards
governing
what
is
defamatory
to
statements
made
during
union
organizing
campaigns
and
the
same
measure
of
damages
were
applied.
many
of
the
typical
comments
invariably
and
inevitably
uttered
during
such
campaigns
could
subject
the
speaker
to
very
heavy
damages.
to
impose
strict
defamation
liability
of
the
participants
in
such
campaigns
could
thus
throw
a
real
monkey
wrench
in
to
the
scheme
of
national
labor
relations
act.
instead
of
the
parties
to
the
dispute
being
able
to
talk
out
and
indeed
curse
out
their
differences
in
a
board
supervised
campaign
and
election.
the
dispute
would
in
effect
be
dragged
into
the
courts
to
be
fought
out
as
any
other
defamation
action.
this
would
be
most
disruptive,
further
it's
unnecessary
because
the
kind
of
abuse
that
might
in
other
context
cause
real
harm
or
ordinarily
be
discounted
were
made
by
a
party
on
the
other
side
of
a
labor
dispute.
we
say
then
that
the
policy
and
integrity
of
the
federal
labor
scheme
simply
cannot
count
on
its
unlimited
liability
for
defamations
arising
from
union
organizational
efforts.
the
unbridle
existence
of
the
threat
of
heavy
damage
of
words
but
defamation
added
during
the
cause
of
union
organizing
campaign
would
have
to
say
the
least
of
killing
effect
upon
the
freedom
of
communication
that
is
so
necessary
to
the
exercise
of
the
employee's
statutory
right
under
section
7
of
the
act
to
bargain
collectively,
to
represent
it
as
of
their
own
choosing.
union
organizers
would
be
most
reluctant
to
speak
out
freely
and
inevitably
if
they
knew
that
words
which
a
customary
employee
in
such
campaigns,
well
it
might
seem
defamatory
to
persons
not
familiar
with
the
actual
conduct
of
labor
disputes
or
to
judges
and
juries
hustle
to
the
goals
of
the
union
could
subject
them
to
heavy
damages.
the
probable
effect
of
permitting
such
suits
would
therefore
be
to
tort
the
effective
exercise
of
these
granted
statutory
rights.
but
we
also
think
that
there's
an
area
in
which
the
state
would
be
able
to
grant
a
remedy
for
defamation.
after
all,
the
states
traditionally
have
had
a
strong
interest
in
protecting
reputation
and
in
awarding
damages
for
injuries
thereto.
and
therefore,
we
think
the
federal
scheme
should
be
viewed
as
displacing
the
same
state
authority
in
this
area
only
to
the
extent
necessary
to
protect
the
federal
scheme
of
labor
relations
throughout
the
country.
there
are
some
kinds
of
defamation
which
are
so
harmful
and
unjustifiable
that
the
state
interest
in
that
suppression
is
compelling
and
as
to
which
suppression
would
involve
no
appreciable
danger
of
serious
interference
with
federal
labor
policy.
state
power
of
such
defamation
is
needed
not
and
should
not
be
deemed
preempted.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
they
are
defamatory
in
the
general
sense
of
the
word.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they
would
be
in
the
general
--
harper
and
james
or
any
of
the
books,
they
say
yes.
that
is
defamatory
statement
but
it
is
not
the
type
of
defamatory
statement
that
we
have
here.
we're
not
trying
to
setup
a
federal
standalone
defamation.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
then
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
then
this
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
the
state
could
not
apply
its
libel
law
to
that
situation
just
like
this
court
says
that
the
state
statute
on
restrain
of
trade
is
alright
but
they
can't
use
it
in
a
labor
dispute.
the
state
law
stays
as
it
is.
they
just
can't
use
it
when
it
runs
up
against
the
federal
interest
in
the
policy
of
the
nlrb.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
malicious
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
right,
yes
sir.
and
not
punitive
damages
in
those
particular
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
in
those
situations.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
it
seriously
injures
the
party
involved.
and
it's
a
broad
stroke
–-
mr.
thurgood
marshall
as
you're
getting
ready
to
say
mr.
justice
brennan,
it's
a
very
broad
stroke
of
a
brush.
but
it's
the
first
opportunity
and
a
necessity
for
doing
so
and
it'll
--
it
will
work
itself
out
as
the
cases
go
along
but
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
say
this
one
falls
in.
one,
we
are
sure
of,
reasonably
sure
if
somebody
calls
at
the
present
day
calls
one
side
or
the
other
communist,
certainly
that's
quite
serious
and
if
it's
maliciously
done,
i
would
assume
that
the
states
would
have
perfect
right
to
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
would
be
that
--
it
would
depend
on
the
state's
situation.
that's
why
we
wouldn't
want
that
to
be
left
to
the
individual
states.
the
nlrb
in
the
cases
that
come
up
before
them
where,
a
language
like
that
is
used,
they
have
almost
consistently
said
it's
not
grounds
for
relief
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--and
the
type
of
relief.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
yes,
sir.
you
see
their
decisions
apply
all
over
so
that
it
will
be
uniform.
that's
what
we're
asking
here.
we
would
not
want
to
see
in
some
area,
for
example,
there
might
be
an
area
in
the
country
where
to
call
a
management
unfair,
they
would
consider
that
to
be
libelous.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
certainly,
mr.
justice
black,
a
dictionary
will
come
up
over
a
period
of
lawsuits.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
courts.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
no
serious
enough
to
be
preempted.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
with
the
--
well
it
would
be
tried
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
it
was
in
a
state
court,
i
would
assume
that
the
state
court
would
have
to
decide
originally,
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
the
labor
board
could
intervene
as
amicus.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
i
don't
know
whether
this
has
ever
been
done
or
not.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
would
be
really
confusing
to
me.
it
just
came
on.
i
don't
know
whether
they
can
or
not.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
we
argue
that
in
our
brief.
we
argue
--
the
united
states
against
sullivan
and
the
--
which
griffin,
and
garrison
where
we
argued
both
of
them
but
we
don't'
think
frankly,
we
don't
think
that
the
sullivan
case
is
exactly
our
case
at
all.
but
what
we
are
interested
in
is
that
just
the
threat
of
a
possible
suit
for
damages
will
definitely
hold
back
a
labor
union
and
in
a
certain
area.
and
in
another
area,
it
might
hold
back
management.
and
the
very
threat
of
it
was
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
i
said
the
philosophy,
yes,
that's
what
i
meant
on
it,
that
the
--
i
would
hate
to
see
a
labor
official
trying
to
convince
people
and
win
his
point
and
be
afraid
of
what
possibility
there
would
be
for
liable
action
against
him,
and
a
few
of
them
could
really
do
it
--
that's
the
real
danger
we
see
in
it.
but
at
the
same
time,
we
don't
go
right
full
tilt
along
with
the
violent
cases
where
this
court
has
made
it
quite
clear
when
violence
moves
in
the
state
keeps
its
control.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
(inaudible)
case
had
said
that
it
can
in
very
well
involve
violence
down
the
line.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
state
should
be
stripped
of
that
if
either
side
in
organizing
campaign
really
destroys
a
man's
reputation
for
good.
you
take
the
man's
business
could
actually
be
ruined
if
in
certain
areas
this
country
you
said
it
was
a
communist
or
a
nazi.
i
mean
he
might
not
--
he
might
win
or
lose
--
might
lose
election
–-
but
will
lose
his
business
too.
and
we
don't
want.
that's
why
we
don't
want
to
see
this
court
say
that
all
of
it
is
preempted.
so
then
we
tried
to
find
something
in
between
and
we
tried
to
draw
these
guidelines.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
cases
as
i
read
them
with
the
nlrb
decision,
that
usually
comes
up
when
the
union
member
uses
some
very
good
language
and
he
subsequently
discharged.
and
he
comes
up
on
that
and
then
the
board
actually
decides
as
to
whether
the
language
is
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
i
would
think
definitely
that
they
would
have
a
greater
interest
in
it
and
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
real
trouble
is
that
if
the
nlrb
finds
that
this
union
is
given
to
--
you
have
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
what
they
call
management,
there's
nothing
they
can
do.
they
can't
give
management
damages.
that's
the
real
problem.
it's
a
double
assault.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean,
i
started
off
with
saying,
this
is
a
real
difficult
one
and
i
wish
we
could
draw
most
specific
lines
that
would
make
a
better
presentation
but
we
run
into
that
real
difficulty.
the
state
laws
on
libel,
slander
of
course
very
strict
yet
bare
this
in
mind
that
whereas
in
the
violence
cases,
if
the
man
sues
for
damages
for
assault
and
battery
and
the
jury
is
a
rather
hostile
jury
to
labor
unions
and
they're
bringing
an
outlandish
verdict.
the
judge
can
very
clearly
set
that
aside
because
there
are
certain
guidelines
about
a
broken
eye
or
broken
arm.
but
as
we
find
in
these
liable
cases,
there's
no
stand
that
a
judge
can
use
on
the
verdict.
if
an
outlandish
verdict
comes
in,
it's
pretty
hard
for
the
judge
to
put
his
expertise
over
that
as
a
jury.
and
we
therefore
think
that
in
this
is
a
more
important
area
to
keep
away
from
the
state
courts
as
much
as
we
can
and
at
the
same
time,
leave
the
state
what
it
needs
to
maintain
its
peace
in
good
order.
and
at
the
same
time,
it's
in
keeping
with
the
national
policy
of
the
nlrb
as
i
see
it
that
in
this
freedom
of
speech,
it
not
go
beyond
certain
limits.
you
don't
recklessly
destroy
a
man's
reputation.
because
if
you
do,
then
you
provoke
the
violence
which
the
whole
act
was
said
people
to
keep
away,
i
think
the
two
are
tied
in
together.
but
the
only
thing
i
am
sure
of
that
the
government
and
the
nlrb
itself
do
not
want
it
left
wide
open.
we're
convinced
that
if
it's
left
wide
open,
there's
an
inherent
danger
of
destroying
what
was
intended
to
be
the
complete
freedom
of
speech.
and
then
the
other
one
is
we
--
we're
stuck
in
between
the
two
i
think.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they're
very
--
they're
very
close.
that's
why
i
think
it
is
closer
to
the
sullivan
case.
i
think
the
interest
of
the
federal
government
is
that
the
person
be
given
a
different
kind
of
leeway
when
he's
in
the
area
of
convincing
other
people.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
absolutely.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
labor
unions
in
some
areas
could
be
completely
destroyed
and
i
go
even
further
that
many
unions,
the
threat
would
do
just
as
much
harm
as
the
judgment.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
is
a
usual
procedure.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir,
they're
several
on
their
way
up
here.
and
they
ran
the
gamut
in
one
case
which
i
don't
think
we
have
here.
in
one
case,
the
union
said
that
so
and
so
the
employer
pays
horrible
wages.
he
only
pays
a
dollar
and
10
to
down
50
cents
an
hour.
and
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
the
average
is
a
little
bit
more
than
that.
and
they're
so
liable
that
because
that
far,
what
i
mean
what
do
you
do.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
this
one
is
being
held
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
these
are
all
pending.
the
board
gets
it.
they
really
don't
know
how
many
are
still
pending
but
as
of
the
time,
it
was
filed
there
were
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
am
afraid
we
don't
know.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
there
are,
as
i
understand
under
the
act,
if
there
is
a
ranking
file
worker
who
has
a
grievance
against
a
supervisor
and
employee,
he
can't
bring
--
he
can
bring
certain
types
of
actions.
in
other
words,
two
individuals
can
use
the
board.
that's
the
only
nearest
thing
i
know.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
no
sir.
i
think
that,
if
we
can
successfully
use
the
sullivan
case
to
get
into
the
exceptions
which
have
grown
up
under
the
garmon
case,
then
i
think
we've
made
our
point
complete
which
is
what
i
hope
we've
done.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
so.
if
there
are
no
more
questions
--
thank
you
sir.
