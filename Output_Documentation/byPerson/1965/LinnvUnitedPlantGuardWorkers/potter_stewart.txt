justice

did
the
board
--
that
wasn't
the
board
finding,
was
it?
that
was
the
administrative
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
had
decided
at
the
administrative
level
by
the
regional
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
approved
by
the
general
counsel.
justice

i
suppose,
under
michigan
law
and
that's
what
governs
here
is
that
the
action
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
substantive
law
of
michigan
i
suppose
that
circulation
of
a
an
amatory
statement,
nearly
libel
just
as
much
as
you've
written
--
or
not,
i
don't
know.
justice
potter
stewart
publishing
one
and
circulating
one
is
generally
--
justice
potter
stewart
all
we
know
so
far
is
that
the
labor
board
at
the
administrative
by
all
how
that
he
wasn't
part
and
parcel
of
the
union
that
he
wasn't
the
member
that
he
had
and
he
wasn't
their
agent.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
had
alleged
that
he
is.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
allege
that
he's
part
and
parcel
of
the
union.
he
could
act
in
consult
without
being
part
and
parcel
of
the
union.
justice
potter
stewart
how
can
we
and
i'm
asking
this
for
information.
i'm
a
little
puzzled,
a
little
troubled
maybe.
maybe
without
reason
but
how
can
we
deal
with
this
case
when
and
all
we
know
so
far
is
that
there's
going
to
be
a
finding
that
doyle
was
not
an
agent
of
the
union
and
that
the
union
was
not
at
all
responsible
for
this
libel?
justice
potter
stewart
this
question
--
the
question
isn't
before
us.
the
question
that's
been
brief
and
argued
and
your
argument
here
really
isn't
before
us
unless
he
--
unless
doyle
was
and
is
an
agent
of
the
union,
isn't
that
correct?
if
he's
just
a
man,
mr.
doyle,
third
party,
then
the
whole
question
has
been
briefed
and
argued
here
isn't
really
here.
justice
potter
stewart
now
it
says
this
is
just
john
smith
who
libeled
your
client.
and
john
smith
not
a
member
of
any
union,
and
not
an
agent
of
any
union
and
then
whole
question
is
part
of
us
isn't
here
at
all,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
your
suggestion
is
that
that
would
be
outrageous
but
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
see
why
--
what
if
mr.
doyle
negligently
ran
over
the
employer
and
that
cut
both
his
legs
off,
he'd
be
subject
to
pay
for
the
heavy
damages.
and
he
also
might
at
the
same
time
be
reinstated
with
back
pay
because
of
some
labor
practice
against
him.
the
two
are
quite
unrelated.
