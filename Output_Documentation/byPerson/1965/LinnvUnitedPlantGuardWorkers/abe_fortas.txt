justice
abe
fortas
what
does
the
record
show?
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
doyle,
a
pinkerton
employee?
justice
abe
fortas
and
he
is
the
defendant,
same
doyle,
referred
earlier.
justice
abe
fortas
and
as
i
read
this,
perhaps
i'm
wrong
and
i
hope
you
correct
it,
so
the
district
court
dismissed
the
action
as
to
everybody
except
doyle,
the
pinkerton
employee,
doyle
did
not
move,
did
not
join
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
that
right?
and
the
union
disavowed
somewhere
in
these
proceedings
any
responsibility
for
doyle
as
their
agent
or
instrumentality,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now
as
i
read
your
complaint,
you
did
not
allege
that
the
defendants
were
responsible
for
preparing
the
material
and
you
alleged
--
in
paragraph
five
as
they
conspired
to
mail
and
circulate
and
publish
by
mailing
and
circulating,
is
that
right?
i
think
you
said
the
contrary
moment
ago,
i
just
want
to
see
if
i
am
incorrect
or
misunderstood.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
paragraph
five
on
page
four
of
the
record.
justice
abe
fortas
by
mailing
and
circulating.
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
you
say
they
compared.
as
i
read
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
read
this
sir,
i
get
the
impression
of
both
the
board
and
the
court,
you're
saying
that
doyle
referred
to
be
an
employee
may
or
may
not
have
been
the
man
that
prepared
and
circulated
this
publication.
but
to
use
it,
there
was
no
evidence
connecting
him
with
the
union
for
this
purpose.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
these
papers
before
this
court
to
indicate
whether
doyle
was
“also
a
union
member
or
an
official
of
the
union”?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
--
excuse
me.
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
that
mr.
doyle
were
a
pinkerton
agent
and
mr.
linn
is
a
pinkerton
agent
too,
would
that
make
any
difference
with
respect
to
the
jurisdictional
issues
here?
the
jurisdictional
issue
i
mean
in
effect,
where
these
assumed
jurisdiction.
i
take
it,
let
me
say
by
to
clarify
that,
i
take
it
that
you're
presenting
the
possibility
that
this
would
be
a
different
case
the
purposes
of
this
basic
issue.
if
the
plaintiff
had
been
in
the
company
rather
than
a
pinkerton
agent.
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
urging
upon
us
the
proposition
that
mr.
linn
being,
let
us
say
a
stranger
to
the
company,
has
no
remedy
at
the
nlrb
and
according
to
this
decision,
no
remedy
in
it,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
managerial
staff
of
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
of
the
employer.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you're
saying
that
you
cannot
accredit
to
mr.
linn
the
disabilities
if
any
of
the
employer's
legal
position.
justice
abe
fortas
general
--
justice
abe
fortas
if
you
start
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
nlrb
jurisdiction,
perhaps
it
would
seem
that
the
more
extreme
the
language,
the
more
malicious,
the
more
outrageous
the
language
is,
the
more
the
interest
the
nlrb
might
have
in
it
in
the
sense
that
it
might
–
that's
a
sort
of
case,
might
more
readily
rule
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
than
a
more
general
and
polite
terms
of
abuse.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
take
the
present
case.
this
is
a
case
where
an
unfair
labor
practice
complaint
was
made
to
the
nlrb.
now
if
the
language
was
totally
extreme
and
as
outrageous,
outrageous
enough
to
come
within
your
definition.
and
it
occurred
in
the
course
of
a
labor
dispute,
would
it
seem
that
to
you
that
the
nlrb
might
have
more
interest
and
not
less
but
more
interest
in
it,
than
if
the
term
abuse
were
within
the
limits
of
the
polite
jargon
which
you
have
so
vividly
described
as
being
customarily
used
in
these
situation.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
isn't
--
it
doesn't
that
solve
the
paradox
in
here
in
the
formula
that
the
department
has
proposed.
justice
abe
fortas
and
as
if
the
problem
i
was
trying
to
get
some
more
light
on
your
answer.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
solicitor
general
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
the
law,
which
you
could
tell
us
about
that
would
preclude
an
action
by
the
company.
let
us
say
the
employer
against
the
individual
who
uttered
the
libel,
even
if
it
were
held
that
action
against
the
union
is
precluded.
let
me
try
to
restate
that.
it's
conceivable
that
the
doctrine
might
be
that
the
nlrb
jurisdiction
prevents
libel
action
between
the
company
and
the
union
based
upon
the
events
and
the
course
of
a
labor
dispute.
is
it
your
understanding
that
that
doctrine
would
necessarily
also
preclude
an
action
involving
the
individual's
concern
rather
than
the
employer
and
the
union
as
such.
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
action
against
the
individual
propriety
and
individual
concern
against
the
individual
concern
leaving
out
the
company
and
the
union.
and
if
that
were
possible
then
at
least
in
theory,
it
might
not
leave
the
parties
that
directly
concerned
without
any
remedy
whatsoever.
justice
abe
fortas
counsel,
a
few
moments
ago
if
you
forgive
me
for
going
back
to
it,
you
made
a
point
of
the
fact
that
the
libel
and
the
allegedly
libel
has
some
material
contained
no
statement
which
was
outside
of
or
irrelevant
to
the
employment
relationship.
justice
abe
fortas
what
significance
do
you
attach
to
that?
justice
abe
fortas
has
this
court
so
held?
justice
abe
fortas
you
don't
know
of
any
--
is
there
any
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
the
relevance
if
i
correctly
understand
you,
you're
saying
that
the
relevance
relates
not
merely
to
the
dispute
or
the
context
of
the
state
but
to
the
precise
nature
and
character
of
the
statements
made
in
the
allegedly
libelous
material.
justice
abe
fortas
counsel,
i
wonder
where
all
that
leaves
you
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
now
as
i
read
your
record,
i
maybe
wrong
about
this.
the
official
of
the
nlrb
be
passed
on
this
was
the
acting
regional
director.
justice
abe
fortas
now
let
me
ask
you
first.
is
it
your
position
that
that
is
adequate
in
the
event
that
some
pre-clearance
or
whatever
one
might
call
it
with
the
nlrb
is
required,
is
the
action
in
your
opinion
of
the
acting
regional
director
enough.
justice
abe
fortas
now
my
second
question
is
this.
in
this
particular
case,
as
i
read
the
record,
the
acting
regional
director
found
that
the
employee
who
prepared
and
circulated
the
material
was
not
an
officer
of
the
union
and
wasn't
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
union
and
that
the
union
was
not
involved
in
this
in
any
way.
now
does
that
mean
that
the
state
court
is
free
to
go
ahead.
in
short,
as
i
take
it
here
that
in
effect
the
nlrb
decided
that
this
was
not
within
its
jurisdiction?
justice
abe
fortas
no
but
they
held
that
–-
they
found
as
i
read
it
that
the
union
was
not
involved
in
the
libel.
justice
abe
fortas
now
if
the
union
wasn't
involved
in
the
libel,
is
the
amount
still
under
the
nlrb
and
let
me
put
in
as
precisely
as
i
can.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
nlrb
held
that
was
a
short
--
that
the
union
was
not
involved
in
this
libel.
does
it
still
follow
that
the
nlrb
exercise
jurisdiction
so
that
the
state
court
or
the
federal
court
was
precluded
from
proceeding
with
the
trial
of
the
case.
justice
abe
fortas
let
us
say
an
investigation
doesn't
settle
the
matter,
does
it,
after
the
investigation.
if
the
nlrb
investigates
the
claim
and
then
comes
out
with
the
conclusion
that
this
was
not
part
of
the
labor
dispute
in
the
sense
that
the
union
was
not
involved
in
it
nor
was
anybody
involved
in
acting
on
behalf
of
the
union.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sorry
to
take
your
time
but
let
me
ask
you
this
specifically.
i
think
you
said
mr.
doyle
resigned
from
the
union
a
year
before
all
of
these
happened.
justice
abe
fortas
now
i
suppose
that
after
mr.
doyle
resigned
from
the
union,
he
had
prepared
and
circulated
this
libelous
material.
and
let
us
suppose
that
he
was
not
joined,
just
to
make
it
easy,
let's
suppose
that
he
was
--
yes,
he
remained
as
a
defendant
in
the
state
case.
now
the
nlrb
conducts
an
investigation
on
the
basis
of
a
complaint
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
it
then
finds
and
concludes
that
the
union
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
this.
but
that
mr.
doyle,
an
individual
outside
of
the
union
and
on
his
own,
circulated
--
prepared
and
circulated
the
allegedly
libelous
material.
is
it
your
position
that
the
district
court
would
still
be
precluded
from
going
ahead
with
this
action
against
the
union
and
against
mr.
doyle?
justice
abe
fortas
there
were
two
differences
that
had
standard.
justice
abe
fortas
counsel,
is
it
your
position
by
taking
the
allegedly
libelous
material
set
forth
in
the
record
before
us,
pages
four
and
six,
i
think
it
is,
that
a
--
this
complaint
would
be
the
solicitor
general's
proposed
test?
justice
abe
fortas
where
is
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well
in
the
context
--
alright,
what
about
that
--
you
said
the
thief
and
robbery
and
i
supposed
that
will
support
of
it.
justice
abe
fortas
so
you
think
this
would
make
the
solicitor
general's
test.
