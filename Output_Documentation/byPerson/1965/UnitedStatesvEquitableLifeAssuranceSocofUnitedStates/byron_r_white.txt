(inaudible)
it
is
really
is
rather
hard
on
the
principle
to
distinguish
here,
this
cost
from
attorney's
fees,
isn't
it
mr.
rifkind?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
probably
kind
of
harder
to
distinguish
between
this
attorney's
fees,
isn't
it,
be
in
interest,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
know
how
much
or
even
the
principal?
how
do
you
know
what
principal
is
going
to
be
ahead
of
your
lien?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
you
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
you
know
what
the
outside
figure,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
take
the
same
position
on
the
other
amounts
that
have
--
under
a
mortgage
that
aren't
either
principal
or
interest
but
nevertheless
is
secured
from
the
mortgage
taxes,
do
you
--
is
that
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
if
the
mortgagee
pays.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
insurance?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
insurance?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
(voice
overlap)
--
so
you
say
the
federal
lien
is
a
--
once
it's
filed
is
prior
to
any
subsequent
insurance
payment.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
life
insurance
the
same
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
private
insurance,
its
(inaudible),
are
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
open-ended
mortgage
on
--
for
future
advances
with
an
outside
limit
placed
on
in
the
mortgage?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
because
it's
of
inchoateness?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
but
take
the
same
position
in
this
case
that
the
attorney's
fees
was
in
a
dollar
amount,
$150
for
each
attorney's
fees.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
right
in
the
mortgage,
yes,
$150
of
attorney's
fee.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
same
with
regard
to
the
principal.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
might
lose
though,
aren't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
are
somewhat
dissatisfied
with
the
whole
choateness
concept
however
as
applied
to
mortgages.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
do
in
new
jersey
with
regard
to
a
second
mortgagee?
there
are
some
states,
i
know
from
experience,
in
which
the
first
mortgagee
may
not
collect
attorney's
fees
as
against
the
second
mortgagee
from
foreclosure
when
there
is
a
--
not
enough
to
pay
both
liens.
and
the
question
is
how
much
the
second
mortgagee
gets?
the
first
mortgagee
may
not
have
out
of
the
property
as
attorney's
fee,
even
though
it's
reserved
in
the
mortgage
even
in
a
specific
amount.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
rule
is
otherwise
some
other
places,
you
know
(inaudible)
--
but
how
about
the
--
how
about
future
advances
as
against
the
second
mortgagee?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
want
to
take
all
your
time
on
it.
justice

(inaudible)
it
is
really

well,
how
do
you
know
how
much
or
even
the
principal?
how
do
you
know
what
principal
is
going
to
be
ahead
of
your

you

you
don't

how
about
