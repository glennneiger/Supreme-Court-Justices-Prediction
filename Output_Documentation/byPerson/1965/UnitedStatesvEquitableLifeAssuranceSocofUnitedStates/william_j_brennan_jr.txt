were
there
other
allowances
of
tax
costs
in
addition
to
the
attorney's
fee
under
this
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
the
government's
position
as
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
these
--
are
all
this
whole
200
and
80
odd
dollars,
are
they
definite?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
is
the
distinction
between
the
tax
cost
which
the
government
concedes
as
priority
and
this
tax
cost
from
the
way
of
--
a
fixed
percentage
for
counsel
fees?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
matter
in
what
way?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

entirely
different
but
i
know
that
they
set
an
entirely
--
justice

brennan,

different
matter,
but
in
what
way
are
they
an
entirely
different
matter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
tax
costs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand
it
this
rule
specifies
so
that
everyone
knows
in
advance
only
as
to
those
apply
x
percentage
to
some
figure,
doesn't
he?
he
knows
what
the
counsel
fee
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
can't
know
that
until
the
sales
end.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
do
know
that
it's
going
to
be
an
x
percent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
fixed
percentage
of
that
--
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
liability
for
cost
apart
from
counsel
fee.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
liability
for
costs
which
you
concede
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
are
prior
to
the
government
lien
are
not
incurred
either
until
equitable
went
into
court
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
at
the
time
of
the
lien,
i
gather
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
wasn't
any
suggestion
of
a
default.
that
all
happened
later.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
that
--
is
that
--
that
all
these
--
that's
why
i
have
trouble
understanding
what
on
principal
how
you
distinguish
those
costs
that
you
concede
superior
to
the
government
lien
under
this
case.
justice
