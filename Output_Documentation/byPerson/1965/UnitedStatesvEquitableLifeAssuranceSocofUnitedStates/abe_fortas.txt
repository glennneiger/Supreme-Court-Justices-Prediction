justice
abe
fortas
mr.
rifkind
--
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
read
your
brief
mr.
rifkind,
i
thought
the
brief
said
that
the
government
acquiesced
in
the
special
treatment
given
to
the
court
cost
and
things
like
that.
and
i
gathered
from
it,
perhaps
quite
wrongly,
that
the
government's
position
is
that
you
have
a
statutory
and
logical
right
to
assert
your
priority
even
with
respect
to
court
costs,
the
cost
of
administration.
but
that
the
government
has
acquiesced
on
the
principle
of
de
minimis
or
state
committee
or
whatnot.
now
from
what
you're
saying
now,
and
i
think
it
perhaps
i
drew
the
wrong
inference
from
your
brief.
justice
abe
fortas
--
if
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
possible,
but
the
other
possibility
it
asserts,
arisen
right
here.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
the
question
of
reconciliation
of
the
law
as
a
general
matter,
and
that's
why
i'm
asking
you
to
put
it
another
way.
is
it
your
position
that
the
government
could
assert
the
priority
of
its
lien
as
against
court
cost,
as
against
cross
of
administration
etcetera,
but
then
it
does
not
do
so
for
whatever
reason,
comity
or
de
minimis
or
whatnot?
or
is
it
your
position
that
there
is
logical
and
legal
distinction
between
attorney's
fees
even
where
they're
fixed
in
amount
in
the
mortgage
or
by
statute
on
the
one
hand
and
the
other
types
of
costs
on
the
other
hand?
i
really
think,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
that
tentatively
i
think
i
have
to
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
justice
abe
fortas
although
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
those
counsel
fees
are
less
than
the
statute
provides,
isn't
that
right?
you
say
there
had
been
a
study
that
you
made,
counsel
fees
were
less
than
1%.
justice
abe
fortas
in
your
state
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sorry,
just
to
clear
this
up
for
me,
you
are
saying
that
your
study
did
not
disclose
its
fee,
counsel
less
than
the
statutory
