mr.
frank
w.
hoak
your
honors.
i
would
like
to
address
first
to
the
statements
which
mr.
rifkind
made
concerning
the
ability
of
the
government
to
say
that
we
should
not
be
entitled
to
any
cost.
to
his
statement
in
answer
to
chief
--
justice
white's
question
about
the
$150
counsel
fee
and
his
statement
that
if
there
was
a
lien
at
all.
these
answers,
i
believe
that
he
has
presented,
indicate
a
misconception
of
the
--
what
a
mortgagee's
lien
is.
it
is
a
different
lien
from
the
lien
of
the
government
at
the
time
that
the
government's
tax
lien
arises,
there
has
been
a
demand
for
payment
of
taxes
and
a
refusal
of
payment
then
the
assessment
is
made,
the
government's
tax
lien
arises.
the
taxpayer
has
default.
he's
in
default
at
the
time
the
lien
arises.
a
mortgagee's
lien
arises
at
the
time
that
the
mortgagor
and
the
mortgagee
enter
into
a
contractual
relationship
whereby
the
mortgagor
agrees
to
repay
alone.
we
don't
know
at
any
time
when
or
if
the
mortgagor
will
default.
if
he
defaults,
our
courts
or
our
legislatures
or
both,
have
said
that
the
only
recourse
we
have
to
realize
anything
out
of
our
mortgage
lien
is
to
foreclose
the
mortgage
in
a
judicial
proceeding.
the
only
way
we
get
anything,
principal,
interest,
costs,
advancement,
anything
we
want,
the
only
way
we
get
it
is
to
commence
the
foreclosure
action
after
default.
carry
that
foreclosure
action
through
to
a
share
of
sale
and
have
the
actual
purchase
price
paid
to
the
sheriff,
our
lien
is
then
extinguished.
that's
when
we
get
paid.
that's
when
our
lien
becomes
meaningful.
if
our
lien
is
taken
away
from
us
prior
to
that
time
we
have
known.
i
believe
that
the
real
question
in
this
case
concerns
the
1913
act
of
congress
which
stated
that
a
federal
tax
lien
shall
not
be
valid
as
to
any
mortgagee
until
notice
is
filed.
in
the
light
of
the
pioneer
case,
i
believe
that
that
statute
should
now
be
read
that
a
federal
tax
lien
shall
not
be
valid
as
to
all
choate
rights
of
mortgagees
until
notice
is
filed.
and
the
question
that
is
presented
to
us
today
is
how
we
are
to
determine
the
choate
rights
of
a
mortgagee.
commencing
in
1950,
this
court
has
decided
almost
a
dozen
cases
involving
competition
or
the
choateness
of
state
created
liens
on
real
property
of
taxpayers
who
are
not
insolvent.
in
all
of
these
cases
except
pioneer,
the
liens
were
for
municipal
taxes,
attachment
liens
or
mechanics
liens.
in
all
of
these
cases
--
although
some
of
these
cases
other
than
pioneer
started
these
mortgage
foreclosure
actions,
the
liens
which
this
court
considered
were
not
held
by
the
foreclosing
mortgagee,
and
that
each
of
these
cases
other
than
pioneer,
the
united
states
disputed
the
entire
lien
with
the
competing
lien
holders.
in
pioneer
however,
and
in
this
case,
the
competing
lien
was
and
is
held
by
the
foreclosing
mortgagee
and
his
mortgage
had
been
recorded
long
prior
to
the
government's
federal
tax
lien.
in
either
of
these
cases
however,
has
the
government
chosen
to
dispute
our
entire
lien,
is
probably
because
if
it
had
chosen
to
do
so
it
would
have
had
to
justify
its
position
in
the
light
of
this
1913
act
of
congress.
and
that
act
did
not
apply
to
these
other
cases
in
which
the
united
states
had
disputed
the
entire
lien.
in
order
to
avoid
this
position,
this
unfavorable
position,
we
believe
that
the
government
made
the
lists
of
all
rights
of
mortgagees.
and
some
of
your
honors
have
discussed
some
of
these
items.
i
would
like
to
mention
a
few
of
them
very
briefly.
although
the
government
concedes
that
principal
is
choate,
it
is
not
difficult
to
describe
a
mortgage
in
which
the
principal
would
not
be
choate.
there
would
be
no
objective
standard
by
which
to
measure
the
amount
it
would
be
due
to
the
mortgagee
that
the
mortgagor
should
default.
in
such
a
case,
the
principal
of
the
mortgage
would
be
every
bit
as
inchoate
until
judgment
is
entered
as
the
counsel
fee
is
in
--
was
in
pioneer.
the
interest
is
even
more
inchoate.
interest
and
counsel
fee
in
new
jersey
are
computed
in
exactly
the
same
manner.
for
that
matter,
the
sheriff's
commissions
are
also
computed
in
the
same
manner.
but
the
am
--
the
actual
dollar
amount
of
our
counsel
fee
is
fixed
at
the
time
the
judgment
is
entered
in
the
foreclosure
action.
the
actual
dollar
amount
of
both
the
interest
and
the
sheriff's
commissions
are
only
determined
at
the
end
of
the
foreclosure
proceeding,
after
judgment,
execution
and
levy,
after
sheriff's
sale
and
payment
of
the
purchase
price
to
the
sheriff.
regarding
to
the
item
of
cost,
the
government
has
not
chosen
to
dispute
sheriff's
cost,
sheriff's
commission
and
tax
costs
other
than
counsel
fees
on
the
grounds
that
these
items
are
usually
de
minimis,
fixed
in
amount
and
constitute
reimbursement
for
some
state
over
to
state
officials.
however,
we
have
reviewed
a
number
of
our
foreclosure
actions
in
which
the
principal
balances
exceeded
$10,000.
we
have
found
that
the
overall
cost
of
foreclosure
ranged
from
5%
to
9%.
the
counsel
fees
which
they
have
chosen
to
dispute
have
accounted
for
only
1
1/2
to
2
1/4%,
and
they
have
ranged
in
amount
from
$250
to
$550.
the
other
costs
exclusive
of
counsel
fees
have
ranged
from
$750
to
(inaudible)
--
$1800.
mr.
frank
w.
hoak
they
were
--
mr.
frank
w.
hoak
--
1
1/2
to
2
1/4%
of
the
principal
balance.
the
percentages
3%,
1
1/2%,
1%
are
applied
to
the
amount
that
is
adjudged
to
be
due
the
plaintiff.
that
would
also
include
an
amount
of
principal
that
was
due
up
to
the
time
we
field
her
affidavit
of
the
amount
due
on
the
defaulted
loan.
mr.
frank
w.
hoak
no
sir.
they
were
the
exact
amounts
computed
by
the
standing
(inaudible).
mr.
frank
w.
hoak
yes
sir,
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
frank
w.
hoak
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
w.
hoak
there
must
be
a
--
an
objective
standard
by
which
to
measure
a
competing
lien.
if
there
is
an
objective
standard
by
which
it
can
be
measured
at
the
time
that
the
notice
of
the
federal
tax
lien
arises,
then
the
lien
is
choate.
if
at
least
--
if
we
are
a
lien
holder
who
is
protected
by
the
1913
congressional
act,
in
order
to
give
any
meaning
to
this
act,
we
must
look
at
the
lien
that
we
are
dealing
with.
and
as
i've
stated,
a
mortgagee's
lien,
default
is
insignificant.
we
never
know
when
that
will
happen.
so
that
if
we
--
if
at
the
time
the
government
files
its
notice
we
can
take
any
of
our
rights
and
just
assume
a
date
to
which
the
interest
will
be
computed
and
determine
what
the
facts
might
--
the
relevant
facts
might
be.
but
make
only
that
one
assumption.
if
we
can
compute
a
fictitious
but
definite
sum
then
i
would
say
that
that
item
is
choate.
that
we
can
do
with
the
new
jersey
counsel
fee.
that
we
can
not
do
with
the
arkansas'
counsel
fee
in
pioneer.
pioneer
was
correctly
held
to
be
inchoate.
i
think
new
jersey's
counsel
fee
should
definitely
be
held
to
be
choate
otherwise
we
can
not
give
substantial
meaning
to
this
1913
congressional
act.
mr.
frank
w.
hoak
as
applied
to
mortgages,
yes
sir
your
honor.
i
do
believe
that
choateness
if
it
is
defined
is
a
very
helpful
tool.
i
think
in
new
britain,
you
defined
it
in
the
general
sense
that
under
the
property,
that
under
the
lien
or
--
and
fixed
in
amount.
but
this
item
of
fixed
in
amount
has
not
been
defined
certainly
as
to
a
mortgagee.
if
we
had
a
definition
of
this
choateness
in
relation
to
a
mortgagee,
the
general
definition
that
could
be
applied
to
each
right
as
it
arises
then
i
think
we
could
avoid
a
lot
of
our
problems
with
the
united
states
government.
mr.
frank
w.
hoak
that
is
not
the
rule
in
new
jersey.
in
fact
in
this
case,
we
had
a
priority
adjustment
fund
equal
to
the
amounts
exclusive
of
counsel
fees
due
to
the
first
and
second
mortgagees.
the
first
mortgagee
obtained
the
amount
of
the
counsel
fee
at
the
expense
of
the
second
mortgagee.
so
that
the
second
mortgagee
is
actually
the
person
who
is
out
$425
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
frank
w.
hoak
we
are
entitled
to
--
well,
when
we
get
into
the
question
of
future
advances
that
--
mr.
frank
w.
hoak
there
is
a
distinction
i
think
sometimes
made
between
whether
there's
a
legal
liability
to
make
the
advance
or
not.
we
can
get
them
under
certain
circumstances
and
others
we
could
not.
the
only
other
thing
that
i
think
i
would
like
to
say
your
honor,
is
this,
that
i
do
believe
that
we
can
get
a
much
more
satisfactory
relationship
in
this
field
and
settle
a
lot
of
the
questions
before
coming
up
to
this
court
if
we
have
a
general
definition
to
be
applied.
mr.
frank
w.
hoak
your
honors.
i
would
like
to
address
first
to
the
statements
which
mr.
rifkind
made
concerning
the
ability
of
the
government
to
say
that
we
should
not
be
entitled
to
any
cost.
to
his
statement
in
answer
to
chief
--
justice
white's
question
about
the
$150
counsel
fee
and
his
statement
that
if
there
was
a
lien
at
all.
these
answers,
i
believe
that
he
has
presented,
indicate
a
misconception
of
the
--
what
a
mortgagee's
lien
is.
it
is
a
different
lien
from
the
lien
of
the
government
at
the
time
that
the
government's
tax
lien
arises,
there
has
been
a
demand
for
payment
of
taxes
and
a
refusal
of
payment
then
the
assessment
is
made,
the
government's
tax
lien
arises.
the
taxpayer
has
default.
he's
in
default
at
the
time
the
lien
arises.
a
mortgagee's
lien
arises
at
the
time
that
the
mortgagor
and
the
mortgagee
enter
into
a
contractual
relationship
whereby
the
mortgagor
agrees
to
repay
alone.
we
don't
know
at
any
time
when
or
if
the
mortgagor
will
default.
if
he
defaults,
our
courts
or
our
legislatures
or
both,
have
said
that
the
only
recourse
we
have
to
realize
anything
out
of
our
mortgage
lien
is
to
foreclose
the
mortgage
in
a
judicial
proceeding.
the
only
way
we
get
anything,
principal,
interest,
costs,
advancement,
anything
we
want,
the
only
way
we
get
it
is
to
commence
the
foreclosure
action
after
default.
carry
that
foreclosure
action
through
to
a
share
of
sale
and
have
the
actual
purchase
price
paid
to
the
sheriff,
our
lien
is
then
extinguished.
that's
when
we
get
paid.
that's
when
our
lien
becomes
meaningful.
if
our
lien
is
taken
away
from
us
prior
to
that
time
we
have
known.
i
believe
that
the
real
question
in
this
case
concerns
the
1913
act
of
congress
which
stated
that
a
federal
tax
lien
shall
not
be
valid
as
to
any
mortgagee
until
notice
is
filed.
in
the
light
of
the
pioneer
case,
i
believe
that
that
statute
should
now
be
read
that
a
federal
tax
lien
shall
not
be
valid
as
to
all
choate
rights
of
mortgagees
until
notice
is
filed.
and
the
question
that
is
presented
to
us
today
is
how
we
are
to
determine
the
choate
rights
of
a
mortgagee.
commencing
in
1950,
this
court
has
decided
almost
a
dozen
cases
involving
competition
or
the
choateness
of
state
created
liens
on
real
property
of
taxpayers
who
are
not
insolvent.
in
all
of
these
cases
except
pioneer,
the
liens
were
for
municipal
taxes,
attachment
liens
or
mechanics
liens.
in
all
of
these
cases
--
although
some
of
these
cases
other
than
pioneer
started
these
mortgage
foreclosure
actions,
the
liens
which
this
court
considered
were
not
held
by
the
foreclosing
mortgagee,
and
that
each
of
these
cases
other
than
pioneer,
the
united
states
disputed
the
entire
lien
with
the
competing
lien
holders.
in
pioneer
however,
and
in
this
case,
the
competing
lien
was
and
is
held
by
the
foreclosing
mortgagee
and
his
mortgage
had
been
recorded
long
prior
to
the
government's
federal
tax
lien.
in
either
of
these
cases
however,
has
the
government
chosen
to
dispute
our
entire
lien,
is
probably
because
if
it
had
chosen
to
do
so
it
would
have
had
to
justify
its
position
in
the
light
of
this
1913
act
of
congress.
and
that
act
did
not
apply
to
these
other
cases
in
which
the
united
states
had
disputed
the
entire
lien.
in
order
to
avoid
this
position,
this
unfavorable
position,
we
believe
that
the
government
made
the
lists
of
all
rights
of
mortgagees.
and
some
of
your
honors
have
discussed
some
of
these
items.
i
would
like
to
mention
a
few
of
them
very
briefly.
although
the
government
concedes
that
principal
is
choate,
it
is
not
difficult
to
describe
a
mortgage
in
which
the
principal
would
not
be
choate.
there
would
be
no
objective
standard
by
which
to
measure
the
amount
it
would
be
due
to
the
mortgagee
that
the
mortgagor
should
default.
in
such
a
case,
the
principal
of
the
mortgage
would
be
every
bit
as
inchoate
until
judgment
is
entered
as
the
counsel
fee
is
in
--
was
in
pioneer.
the
interest
is
even
more
inchoate.
interest
and
counsel
fee
in
new
jersey
are
computed
in
exactly
the
same
manner.
for
that
matter,
the
sheriff's
commissions
are
also
computed
in
the
same
manner.
but
the
am
--
the
actual
dollar
amount
of
our
counsel
fee
is
fixed
at
the
time
the
judgment
is
entered
in
the
foreclosure
action.
the
actual
dollar
amount
of
both
the
interest
and
the
sheriff's
commissions
are
only
determined
at
the
end
of
the
foreclosure
proceeding,
after
judgment,
execution
and
levy,
after
sheriff's
sale
and
payment
of
the
purchase
price
to
the
sheriff.
regarding
to
the
item
of
cost,
the
government
has
not
chosen
to
dispute
sheriff's
cost,
sheriff's
commission
and
tax
costs
other
than
counsel
fees
on
the
grounds
that
these
items
are
usually
de
minimis,
fixed
in
amount
and
constitute
reimbursement
for
some
state
over
to
state
officials.
however,
we
have
reviewed
a
number
of
our
foreclosure
actions
in
which
the
principal
balances
exceeded
$10,000.
we
have
found
that
the
overall
cost
of
foreclosure
ranged
from
5%
to
9%.
the
counsel
fees
which
they
have
chosen
to
dispute
have
accounted
for
only
1
1/2
to
2
1/4%,
and
they
have
ranged
in
amount
from
$250
to
$550.
the
other
costs
exclusive
of
counsel
fees
have
ranged
from
$750
to
(inaudible)
--
$1800.
mr.
frank
w.
hoak
they
were
--
mr.
frank

--
1
1/2
to
2
1/4%
of
the
principal
balance.
the
percentages
3%,
1
1/2%,
1%
are
applied
to
the
amount
that
is
adjudged
to
be
due
the
plaintiff.
that
would
also
include
an
amount
of
principal
that
was
due
up
to
the
time
we
field
her
affidavit
of
the
amount
due
on
the
defaulted
loan.

be
a
--
an
objective
standard
by
which
to
measure
a
competing
lien.
if
there
is
an
objective
standard
by
which
it
can
be
measured
at
the
time
that
the
notice
of
the
federal
tax
lien
arises,
then
the
lien
is
choate.
if
at
least
--
if
we
are
a
lien
holder
who
is
protected
by
the
1913
congressional
act,
in
order
to
give
any
meaning
to
this
act,
we
must
look
at
the
lien
that
we
are
dealing
with.
and
as
i've
stated,
a
mortgagee's
lien,
default
is
insignificant.
we
never
know
when
that
will
happen.
so
that
if
we
--
if
at
the
time
the
government
files
its
notice
we
can
take
any
of
our
rights
and
just
assume
a
date
to
which
the
interest
will
be
computed
and
determine
what
the
facts
might
--
the
relevant
facts
might
be.
but
make
only
that
one
assumption.
if
we
can
compute
a
fictitious
but
definite
sum
then
i
would
say
that
that
item
is
choate.
that
we
can
do
with
the
new
jersey
counsel
fee.
that
we
can
not
do
with
the
arkansas'
counsel
fee
in
pioneer.
pioneer
was
correctly
held
to
be
inchoate.
i
think
new
jersey's
counsel
fee
should
definitely
be
held
to
be
choate
otherwise
we
can
not
give
substantial
meaning
to
this
1913
congressional
act.
mr.
frank
w.
hoak
as
applied
to
mortgages,
yes
sir
your
honor.
i
do
believe
that
choateness
if
it
is
defined
is
a
very
helpful
tool.
i
think
in
new
britain,
you
defined
it
in
the
general
sense
that
under
the
property,
that
under
the
lien
or
--
and
fixed
in
amount.
but
this
item
of
fixed
in
amount
has
not
been
defined
certainly
as
to
a
mortgagee.
if
we
had
a
definition
of
this
choateness
in
relation
to
a
mortgagee,
the
general
definition
that
could
be
applied
to
each
right
as
it
arises
then
i
think
we
could
avoid
a
lot
of
our
problems
with
the
united
states
government.
mr.
frank
w.
hoak
that
is
not
the
rule
in
new
jersey.
in
fact
in
this
case,
we
had
a
priority
adjustment
fund
equal
to
the
amounts
exclusive
of
counsel
fees
due
to
the
first
and
second
mortgagees.
the
first
mortgagee
obtained
the
amount
of
the
counsel
fee
at
the
expense
of
the
second
mortgagee.
so
that
the
second
mortgagee
is
actually
the
person
who
is
out
$425
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
frank
w.
hoak
we
are
entitled
to
--
well,
when
we
get
into
the
question
of
future
advances
that
--
mr.
frank
w.
hoak
there
is
a
distinction
i
think
sometimes
made
between
whether
there's
a
legal
liability
to
make
the
advance
or
not.
we
can
get
them
under
certain
circumstances
and
others
we
could
not.
the
only
other
thing
that
i
think
i
would
like
to
say
your
honor,
is
this,
that
i
do
believe
that
we
can
get
a
much
more
satisfactory
relationship
in
this
field
and
settle
a
lot
of
the
questions
before
coming
up
to
this
court
if
we
have
a
general
definition
to
be
applied.
