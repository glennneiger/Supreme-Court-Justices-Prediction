mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
it
brings
once
again
to
this
court
an
aspect
of
the
recurring
problem
of
the
relationship
of
the
federal
tax
lien
to
conflicting
state
created
liens.
the
question
here
arises
from
the
application
of
a
state
court
rule,
which
you
may
find
in
page
19
of
our
brief,
which
provides
that
in
mortgage
foreclosure
actions,
an
allowance
for
an
attorney's
fee
determined
as
a
stated
percentage
of
all
sums
adjudged
to
be
paid
the
plaintiff,
mortgagee,
shall
be
included
in
the
tax
costs
of
the
action
and
paid
to
the
mortgagee
out
of
the
proceeds
of
the
foreclosure
sale.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
court
below
was
correct
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
in
holding
that
the
mortgagee
is
entitled
to
recover,
not
only
his
principle
in
interest,
but
also
the
attorney's
fee
ahead
of
a
federal
tax
lien
which
had
attached
after
the
mortgage
but
subsequent
to
the
default
which
led
to
the
foreclosure
--
but
before
the
default
which
led
to
the
foreclosure,
i'm
sorry.
the
facts
from
which
the
controversy
arise
are
not
complex.
in
december
1960,
respondent
equitable
life
assurance
society
loaned
one
albert
bagin
and
his
wife
$30,000
to
be
repaid
at
6%
interest
over
a
period
of
28
years.
to
secure
repayment,
equitable
received
a
mortgage
covering
real
estate
owned
by
the
bagins.
the
mortgage
was
properly
record
in
the
next
few
days.
second
and
third
mortgagees
were
subsequently
conveyed
to
other
mortgagees
but
are
not
directly
involved
here.
more
than
a
year
later,
in
march
1962,
the
united
states
filed
notice
of
the
federal
tax
lien
against
bagin.
the
lien
secured
a
liability
for
$7700
in
unpaid
taxes.
the
lien
arose
under
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
upon
the
assessment
of
the
tax
liability
under
section
6321,
which
is
at
page
17
of
our
brief.
it
was
a
lien
in
favor
of
the
united
states
upon
all
property
and
rights
to
property
belonging
to
the
taxpayer.
and
under
section
6323,
the
lien
was
not
valid
as
against
any
mortgagee,
pledgee,
purchaser
or
judgment
creditor
until
notice
was
prompt
--
properly
filed.
such
notice
was
filed
on
march
21,
1962.
a
year
later,
on
march
1,
1963
the
bagins
for
the
first
time
defaulted
on
their
monthly
payments
to
equitable.
after
that
default,
it
continued
for
more
than
30
days,
equitable
exercised
its
rights
under
the
mortgage
to
declare
the
principal
sum
and
unpaid
interest
immediately
due.
and
on
june
4,
1963
equitable
filed
a
complaint
in
the
superior
court
of
bergen
county
seeking
foreclosure
of
the
mortgage.
the
united
states
was
named
as
a
defendant
in
that
action
and
summoned
to
answer
the
complaint.
in
its
answer,
the
united
states
conceded
that
the
principle
and
interest
on
equitable's
mortgage
was
prior
to
the
federal
lien,
but
denied
that
the
federal
lien
was
subordinate
to
any
claim
equitable
might
acquire
to
counsel
fees.
on
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
superior
court
held
that
the
federal
tax
lien
was
junior
to
the
claim
for
principal
and
interest
under
the
mortgage
but
senior
to
equitable's
claim
for
counsel
fees
and
that
any
counsel
fee
awarded
should
be
allowed
in
a
surplus
money
proceeding.
the
court
thought
that
this
conclusion
was
required
by
this
court's
decision
recently
in
united
states
v.pioneer
american
insurance
company.
equitable
appealed
the
appellate
division
and
while
the
case
was
pending
there
the
appeal
was
certified
to
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
on
that
court's
own
motion.
the
supreme
court
reversed.
it
held
that
the
equit
--
that
equitable
was
entitled
to
priority
over
the
federal
lien
not
only
for
its
principal
and
interest
and
costs
but
also
for
its
counsel
fee
under
the
rules
of
the
new
jersey
courts.
that
fee
had
in
the
meantime
been
determined
to
be
425
odd
dollars.
because
the
total
claims
exceeded
the
net
proceeds
of
the
foreclosure
sale,
the
practical
immediate
consequence
of
the
decision
was
to
reduce
the
government's
recovery
on
its
$7700
tax
lien
from
$491
to
$66.
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
the
uniform
application
of
the
federal
tax
law
and
the
protection
of
federal
revenues
requires
that
state
determinations
of
the
relative
priority
of
federal
tax
liens
must
meet
federal
standards.
it
implies
no
disrespect
to
the
states
to
recognize
as
this
court
has
that
in
the
absence
of
federal
standards,
the
inevitable
and
natural
tendency
of
the
states
would
be
to
give
precedence
to
state
created
liens
running
in
favor
of
local
real
estate
taxes,
various
municipal
assessments
as
was
the
case
in
new
britain
and
buffalo
savings
bank,
or
local
commercial
interests,
all
of
which
hit
closer
to
home.
accordingly
to
avoid
the
unequal
application
of
the
federal
tax
laws
and
to
protect
federal
revenues
from
being
whittled
away,
the
court
has
evolved
the
general
rule
that
whatever
may
be
the
priorities
among
state
created
liens,
a
recorded
federal
tax
lien
is
subordinate
to
all
previously
perfected
liens
and
superior
to
all
subsequent
and
inchoate
liens.
a
corollary
of
that
rule
is
that
subsequently
perfected
liens
do
not
relate
back
to
the
time
of
their
creation
to
defeat
federal
liens
perfected
in
the
interval.
this
doctrine
represents
an
elaboration
of
a
principle
dating
back
to
chief
justice
marshall
that
first
in
time,
is
first
in
right.
now
the
court
had
occasioned
to
apply
this
general
principle
to
facts
quite
similar
to
those
presented
here
in
the
pioneer
american
insurance
company
case
three
years
ago.
pioneer
involved
a
mortgage
that
provided
in
terms
that
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
shall
be
added
to
the
principle
sum
and
shall
be
secured
by
the
instrument
in
the
event
of
foreclosure.
the
court
held
that
where
federal
tax
liens
were
accorded
after
the
mortgage,
after
default,
after
the
commencement
of
the
foreclosure
proceedings
but
before
the
entry
of
judgment
fixing
the
amount
of
the
attorney's
fees
such
tax
liens
were
entitled
to
priority
over
the
lien
for
counsel
fees.
the
court
likened
the
mortgagee's
lien
for
counsel
fees
to
a
lien
to
secure
future
indebtedness,
which
had
been
held
inchoate
in
united
states
v.
ball
construction
company.
the
court
concluded
that
likewise
when
a
mortgagee
has
a
lien
for
an
attorney's
fee
which
is
uncertain
in
amount
and
yet
to
be
incurred
and
paid,
such
a
lien
is
inchoate
and
is
subordinate
to
the
intervening
federal
tax
lien
filed
before
the
mortgagee's
lien
for
the
attorney's
fee
matures.
now,
it
is
unquestionably
true
that
there
are
points
of
difference
between
the
present
case
and
pioneer.
several
of
them,
i
think,
show
that
this
is
a
much
stronger
case.
nevertheless
as
the
court
below
stressed,
the
precise
percentages
set
forth
in
the
new
jersey
rule
given
apparent
definiteness
to
equitable's
claim
for
counsel
fees
which
was
not
supplied
by
the
relatively
and
definite
provision
for
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--
in
pioneer's
mortgage.
sir
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
there
were
some
200
odd
dollars
of
normal
tax
cost,
court
fees
and
so
on.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
government
has
never
disputed
that
normal
tax
costs
which
are
definite
amount
which
are
paid
generally
speaking
to
court
officials
as
a
toll
for
using
the
court
have
precedence
over
everything.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
they
are
certainly
as
definite
as
things
can
be
in
the
--
in
life.
there's
a
$10
fee
for
that
and
a
$50
fee
for
that.
in
addition,
and
i
don't
mean
to
mislead
you,
there
are
expenses
of
the
sale.
the
sheriff
who
conducts
the
sale
gets
a
percentage
of
the
proceeds,
but
we're
talking
here
about
the
net
proceeds
of
the
sale
rather
than
the
gross
proceeds.
you
have
to
hire
a
hall
perhaps
to
accommodate
the
people
who
want
to
bid.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
there
is
--
there's
first
of
all
the
historical
difference
that
we
have
always
recognized
or
generally
recognized
in
the
united
states,
in
this
court,
throughout
the
states
that
there
is
a
difference
between
counsel
fees
as
cost
which
may
or
may
not
be
allowable,
generally
are
not,
and
the
fees
paid
into
court
to
clerks
and
so
on
for
services
provided
by
the
court.
and
that
distinction
is
not
foreign
to
the
new
jersey
courts.
only
shortly
before
this
case
was
decided,
the
supreme
court
wrote
in
united
states-pipe
&
foundry
--
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
wrote
in
united
states-pipe
&
foundry,
which
is
cited
on
page
14
of
our
brief
that
cost
generally
comprise
principally
certain
statutory
allowances,
amounts
paid
the
clerk
in
fees
and
various
other
specified
disbursements
of
counsel,
including
sheriff's
fees,
witness
fees,
deposition
expenses
and
printing
costs.
counsel
fees,
although
if
allowable,
are
included
in
the
tax
costs
are
an
entirely
different
matter.
so
this
isn't
a
noble
notion
to
the
--
even
to
the
new
jersey
courts.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i'm
sorry?
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
--
they
took
a
much
more
restrictive
view
of
the
circumstances
under
which
those
might
possibly
be
allowed.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
as
tax
costs.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right,
if
you
know
the
amount
of
the
judgment
to
be
allowed.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
you
can't
know
that
until
judgment.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
but
certainly
when
the
federal
lien
arose
you
didn't
know
what
it
was
going
to
pay
you.
there
is
also
the
fact
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
except
i
think
on
the
theory
which
in
a
way
the
court
adopted
in
pioneer
that
there
is
a
difference
between
something
reimbursement
for
an
amount
paid
into
court
or
state
court
officers
as
a
toll
for
judicial
process,
and
something
paid
to
your
adversary
for
his
lawyer
who
is
representing
him
in
an
adverse
relationship.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no,
i
think
not.
there
is
no
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
you
certainly
don't
know
at
any
time
the
dollar
figure,
but
the
crucial
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
when
the
federal
lien
arises,
you
don't
get
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no,
but
the
point
is
that
the
counsel
fee
problem
is
contingent
and
inchoate
in
a
much
more
fundamental
sense.
you
know
that
principal
and
interest
are
going
to
be
returned
that
the
principal
is
going
to
be
--
is
to
be
returned.
the
liability
has
arisen.
with
respect
to
counsel
fees
the
liability
which
the
lien
is
designed
to
secure
has
not
occurred
until
default.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
with
respect
to
taxes
that
the
mortgagee
might
pay?
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
we've
certainly
taken
the
position
consistently
and
the
court
has
supported
us
in
that
view
that
if
the
mortgagee
pays
taxes
after
a
federal
lien
arises
and
those
taxes
themselves,
state
taxes,
would
be
junior
to
the
federal
lien
that
the
recompense
for
the
amounts
paid
out
are
not
senior
to
the
federal
lien.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
insurance
presents
a
more
difficult
question.
if
--
it
depends
upon
what
the
insurance
is
to
cover.
if
the
insurance
is
merely
to
cover
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
if
it's
--
but
the
question
is
how
much.
if
it's
merely
designed
to
secure
the
mortgagee's
interest
then
it's
of
no
value
or
interest
to
the
united
states
to
help
them
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
any
subsequent
advances,
that's
right.
i
would
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i'm
not
sure
i
think
of
how
life
insurance
would
come
into
play,
but
i
--
but
the
general
rule
is
that
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
all
advances
made
subsequent
to
the
falling
in
the
--
or
of
the
attachment
of
the
federal
lien
have
to
be
subordinate
under
the
general
rule,
first
in
time
is
first
in
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
court
has
taken
the
view
in
a
long
series
of
cases
that
a
security
for
future
advances
does
not
give
priority
when
those
advances
occur
after
the
federal
lien
arises.
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
because
of
inchoateness,
because
--
well,
in
a
sense
there's
a
very
practical
problem
here.
we
live
in
a
society
that
the
local
expression
is
in
hot.
people
are
borrowing
credit
all
the
time.
if
you
didn't
in
some
way
say
these
types
of
security
arrangements
we're
going
to
recognize,
but
security
arrangements
for
everything
in
the
future
we're
not
going
to
recognize,
it's
simply
be
no
way
for
a
federal
lien
to
attach
to
anything
in
most
cases.
you
could
suppose
an
assignment,
indeed
it's
not
unheard
of,
as
--
of
all
future
wages
for
all
future
credit
to
be
extended
that
embraces
everything.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
specified
in
the
mortgage
or
in
the
lien
or
in
the
rules?
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
still
remains
the
fact
that
at
the
time
the
federal
lien
attached
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
at
all
that
foreclosure
would
take
place,
the
default
would
take
place.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
was
a
remote
contingency.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
but
until
default
--
until
the
equitable
has
to
go
into
court,
it
doesn't
incur
a
liability.
it
has
incurred
the
liability
for
the
principal
and
it's
entitled
to
the
price
of
its
money
which
is
interest.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it's
that
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
perhaps
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
certainly
true,
and
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
perhaps
there
is
an
inconsistency.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
perhaps
there
is
an
inconsistency.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
but
there
has
been
--
there
is
the
feeling
that
these
are
small,
they're
de
minimis.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
and
there's
an
element
of
comity
to
the
states.
it's
going
to
state
officers.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
you
don't.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
although
i'm
sure
is
that
the
problem
hasn't
arisen
and
therefore
we've
never
been
forced
to
an
election
or
its
determination
that
this
is
a
matter
of
grace
on
the
part
of
the
government
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--
or
rise
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
counsel
fee?
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
think
logically
we
--
under
the
decisions
up
to
date
and
what
little
one
can
get
out
of
the
statute,
we
should
be
entitled
to
say
no
costs
of
any
sort.
i
think
a
distinction
can
be
drawn
nonetheless
between
the
two
types
of
costs
which
perhaps
eases
the
inevitable
frictions
between
state
and
federal
governments
and
which
the
treasury
has
been
willing
to
draw,
and
which
i
hope
they
will
continue
to
draw
because
it
makes
life
much
simpler.
but
i
think
as
a
logical
matter,
we
should
be
able
to
insist
on
cost
in
their
entirety.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i'm
--
i
wish
should
be
entitled
to
priority
to
cost
--
over
cost
in
their
entirety.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
possible.
returning
briefly
to
the
supposed
precision
of
the
percentages
supplied
by
the
court
rules,
i
just
want
to
emphasize
that
there
are
many
circumstances
in
which
the
sums
adjudged
to
be
paid
can
be
varied
by
factors
other
than
the
accrue
interest
and
principal,
which
therefore
would
affect
the
sums
adjudged
to
be
paid
and
therefore
protect
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes
it
is.
its
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--
1%,
1.5%,
3%
over
some
amount,
but
there
are
--
they
are
taxes,
there
is
insurance,
there're
all
sorts
of
things
which
might
or
might
not
have
priority
over
the
federal
claim
which
nevertheless
expand
or
contract
the
attorney's
fees.
and
i
think
the
allu
--
the
impression
of
precision
is
really
a
little
illusory.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
government's
position
would
still
be
that
at
the
time
the
federal
lien
attached,
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
fee
was
contingent.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
than
the
costs,
the
court
costs,
that's
true.
now
there
is
an
important
distinction
which
--
between
pioneer
and
this
case
which
i
think
also
is
worthy
of
some
note
and
it
bears
on
this
problem
of
contingency,
because
after
all
in
pioneer
by
the
time
the
federal
lien
was
reported
defaults
had
occurred,
the
mortgagee
had
elected
to
declare
the
note
due
and
payable,
an
attorney
had
been
engaged
and
a
suit
to
foreclose
the
mortgage
had
been
filed.
there
was
no
doubt
in
pioneer
that
the
attorney's
fee
was
to
be
incurred.
the
--
some
uncertainty
as
to
the
amount,
it
hadn't
actually
been
incurred
but
there
was
really
no
contingency
that
it
would
be
con
--
incurred.
in
the
present
case,
all
of
those
events
were
in
the
unforeseeable,
unpredictable
future.
a
year
was
to
go
by
after
the
federal
lien
was
recorded
before
the
default
occurred
which
precipitated
the
foreclosure
which
led
ultimately
to
the
allowance
of
an
attorney's
fee.
if
pioneer's
lien
was
like
a
lien
to
secure
future
indebtedness
even
though
the
lawyer
whose
fee
was
involved
was
already
hard
at
work,
here,
the
degree
of
futurity,
the
element
of
contingency
is
much
more
marked.
the
fact
is
that
equitable's
lien,
if
there
was
a
lien
at
all,
was
entirely
contingent
because
the
events
which
would
lead
to
the
liability
which
the
lien
would
secure
had
not
occurred
and
might
never
have
occurred.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice,
i
just
like
to
make
one
or
two
very
short
points.
as
counsel
for
equitable
pointed
out,
the
question
of
fixed
in
amount
as
spelled
out
in
new
britain
has
not
been
spelled
out
in
great
detail.
but
one
thing
ought
to
be
very
clear,
if
you
can't
tell
whether
the
amount
is
something
or
another,
as
was
the
case
here,
it
certainly
not
fixed
in
amount.
in
this
case,
we're
not
talking
about
whether
it
was
$10
or
$12
or
$100.
at
the
time
the
federal
lien
attached
we
didn't
know
where
there
was
any
dollars
and
in
fact
it
might
well
and
in
the
normal
course
of
things
would've
been
nothing.
the
respondent
also
faces
great
reliance
on
the
1912
or
1913
act
of
congress,
which
it
says
cong
--
in
which
it
says
congress
impended
to
protect
a
wide
variety
of
interests
pertaining
to
the
mortgagee.
now
the
1912
act,
which
is
now
section
6323,
simply
provides
that
until
recorded
the
federal
tax
lien
should
be
invalid
as
against
mortgagees
as
well
as
against
a
variety
of
other
people.
and
it
seems
quite
clear
that
it
was
designed
simply
to
protect
against
the
secret
lien.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
committee
reports
deal
largely
with
the
problem
of
the
purchaser
who
doesn't
know
that
a
lien
is
attached
to
his
property.
but
there
is
reason
to
suppose
that
it
intended
to
protect
every
device
for
augmenting
a
mortgagee's
security
against
prospective
risks
whenever
they
might
ripen
into
liabilities
that
mortgagee's
lawyers
could
device.
indeed
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
pioneer,
congress
did
not
intend
to
purport
or
did
not
purport
to
affect
the
time
at
which
local
liens
were
deemed
to
arise
or
to
become
choate
or
to
subordinate
the
tax
lien
to
tentative,
conditional
or
imperfect
state
liens.
clearly
when
the
federal
lien
arose
here,
equitable's
lien
if
there
was
one
at
that
point
was
at
best
tentative
conditional
and
imperfect.
finally,
i'd
like
to
point
out
one
other
attribute
of
the
new
jersey
rule
and
of
similar
rules
in
a
few
other
states
that
provide
court
counsel
fees.
it
seems
to
me,
although
i
have
not
investigated
the
legislative
history
of
many
of
these
rules,
that
they
were
designed
principally
not
to
augment
the
mortgagee's
reach,
but
rather
to
restrict
it.
they
were
designed
to
prevent
overbearing.
they
were
designed
to
prevent
overreaching
and
they
did
it
by
saying,
as
new
jersey
says,
no
counsel
fee
shall
be
allowed
no
matter
what
the
mortgage
says
except
as
provided.
and
that's
--
the
theme
runs
through
the
several
states
that
have
such
arrangements.
they
were
not
designed
to
make
integral
to
the
mortgages
property
right
as
the
equitable
would
suggest.
some
new
claim
but
were
designed
to
restrict
overreaching
on
the
part
of
creditors.
i
don't
think
that
gives
a
right
that
the
congress
intended
to
protect
at
least
until
the
time
the
liability
arises.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
it
brings
once
again
to
this
court
an
aspect
of
the
recurring
problem
of
the
relationship
of
the
federal
tax
lien
to
conflicting
state
created
liens.
the
question
here
arises
from
the
application
of
a
state
court
rule,
which
you
may
find
in
page
19
of
our
brief,
which
provides
that
in
mortgage
foreclosure
actions,
an
allowance
for
an
attorney's
fee
determined
as
a
stated
percentage
of
all
sums
adjudged
to
be
paid
the
plaintiff,
mortgagee,
shall
be
included
in
the
tax
costs
of
the
action
and
paid
to
the
mortgagee
out
of
the
proceeds
of
the
foreclosure
sale.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
court
below
was
correct
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
in
holding
that
the
mortgagee
is
entitled
to
recover,
not
only
his
principle
in
interest,
but
also
the
attorney's
fee
ahead
of
a
federal
tax
lien
which
had
attached
after
the
mortgage
but
subsequent
to
the
default
which
led
to
the
foreclosure
--
but
before
the
default
which
led
to
the
foreclosure,
i'm
sorry.
the
facts
from
which
the
controversy
arise
are
not
complex.
in
december
1960,
respondent
equitable
life
assurance
society
loaned
one
albert
bagin
and
his
wife
$30,000
to
be
repaid
at
6%
interest
over
a
period
of
28
years.
to
secure
repayment,
equitable
received
a
mortgage
covering
real
estate
owned
by
the
bagins.
the
mortgage
was
properly
record
in
the
next
few
days.
second
and
third
mortgagees
were
subsequently
conveyed
to
other
mortgagees
but
are
not
directly
involved
here.
more
than
a
year
later,
in
march
1962,
the
united
states
filed
notice
of
the
federal
tax
lien
against
bagin.
the
lien
secured
a
liability
for
$7700
in
unpaid
taxes.
the
lien
arose
under
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
upon
the
assessment
of
the
tax
liability
under
section
6321,
which
is
at
page
17
of
our
brief.
it
was
a
lien
in
favor
of
the
united
states
upon
all
property
and
rights
to
property
belonging
to
the
taxpayer.
and
under
section
6323,
the
lien
was
not
valid
as
against
any
mortgagee,
pledgee,
purchaser
or
judgment
creditor
until
notice
was
prompt
--
properly
filed.
such
notice
was
filed
on
march
21,
1962.
a
year
later,
on
march
1,
1963
the
bagins
for
the
first
time
defaulted
on
their
monthly
payments
to
equitable.
after
that
default,
it
continued
for
more
than
30
days,
equitable
exercised
its
rights
under
the
mortgage
to
declare
the
principal
sum
and
unpaid
interest
immediately
due.
and
on
june
4,
1963
equitable
filed
a
complaint
in
the
superior
court
of
bergen
county
seeking
foreclosure
of
the
mortgage.
the
united
states
was
named
as
a
defendant
in
that
action
and
summoned
to
answer
the
complaint.
in
its
answer,
the
united
states
conceded
that
the
principle
and
interest
on
equitable's
mortgage
was
prior
to
the
federal
lien,
but
denied
that
the
federal
lien
was
subordinate
to
any
claim
equitable
might
acquire
to
counsel
fees.
on
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
superior
court
held
that
the
federal
tax
lien
was
junior
to
the
claim
for
principal
and
interest
under
the
mortgage
but
senior
to
equitable's
claim
for
counsel
fees
and
that
any
counsel
fee
awarded
should
be
allowed
in
a
surplus
money
proceeding.
the
court
thought
that
this
conclusion
was
required
by
this
court's
decision
recently
in
united
states
v.pioneer
american
insurance
company.
equitable
appealed
the
appellate
division
and
while
the
case
was
pending
there
the
appeal
was
certified
to
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
on
that
court's
own
motion.
the
supreme
court
reversed.
it
held
that
the
equit
--
that
equitable
was
entitled
to
priority
over
the
federal
lien
not
only
for
its
principal
and
interest
and
costs
but
also
for
its
counsel
fee
under
the
rules
of
the
new
jersey
courts.
that
fee
had
in
the
meantime
been
determined
to
be
425
odd
dollars.
because
the
total
claims
exceeded
the
net
proceeds
of
the
foreclosure
sale,
the
practical
immediate
consequence
of
the
decision
was
to
reduce
the
government's
recovery
on
its
$7700
tax
lien
from
$491
to
$66.
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
the
uniform
application
of
the
federal
tax
law
and
the
protection
of
federal
revenues
requires
that
state
determinations
of
the
relative
priority
of
federal
tax
liens
must
meet
federal
standards.
it
implies
no
disrespect
to
the
states
to
recognize
as
this
court
has
that
in
the
absence
of
federal
standards,
the
inevitable
and
natural
tendency
of
the
states
would
be
to
give
precedence
to
state
created
liens
running
in
favor
of
local
real
estate
taxes,
various
municipal
assessments
as
was
the
case
in
new
britain
and
buffalo
savings
bank,
or
local
commercial
interests,
all
of
which
hit
closer
to
home.
accordingly
to
avoid
the
unequal
application
of
the
federal
tax
laws
and
to
protect
federal
revenues
from
being
whittled
away,
the
court
has
evolved
the
general
rule
that
whatever
may
be
the
priorities
among
state
created
liens,
a
recorded
federal
tax
lien
is
subordinate
to
all
previously
perfected
liens
and
superior
to
all
subsequent
and
inchoate
liens.
a
corollary
of
that
rule
is
that
subsequently
perfected
liens
do
not
relate
back
to
the
time
of
their
creation
to
defeat
federal
liens
perfected
in
the
interval.
this
doctrine
represents
an
elaboration
of
a
principle
dating
back
to
chief
justice
marshall
that
first
in
time,
is
first
in
right.
now
the
court
had
occasioned
to
apply
this
general
principle
to
facts
quite
similar
to
those
presented
here
in
the
pioneer
american
insurance
company
case
three
years
ago.
pioneer
involved
a
mortgage
that
provided
in
terms
that
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
shall
be
added
to
the
principle
sum
and
shall
be
secured
by
the
instrument
in
the
event
of
foreclosure.
the
court
held
that
where
federal
tax
liens
were
accorded
after
the
mortgage,
after
default,
after
the
commencement
of
the
foreclosure
proceedings
but
before
the
entry
of
judgment
fixing
the
amount
of
the
attorney's
fees
such
tax
liens
were
entitled
to
priority
over
the
lien
for
counsel
fees.
the
court
likened
the
mortgagee's
lien
for
counsel
fees
to
a
lien
to
secure
future
indebtedness,
which
had
been
held
inchoate
in
united
states
v.
ball
construction
company.
the
court
concluded
that
likewise
when
a
mortgagee
has
a
lien
for
an
attorney's
fee
which
is
uncertain
in
amount
and
yet
to
be
incurred
and
paid,
such
a
lien
is
inchoate
and
is
subordinate
to
the
intervening
federal
tax
lien
filed
before
the
mortgagee's
lien
for
the
attorney's
fee
matures.
now,
it
is
unquestionably
true
that
there
are
points
of
difference
between
the
present
case
and
pioneer.
several
of
them,
i
think,
show
that
this
is
a
much
stronger
case.
nevertheless
as
the
court
below
stressed,
the
precise
percentages
set
forth
in
the
new
jersey
rule
given
apparent
definiteness
to
equitable's
claim
for
counsel
fees
which
was
not
supplied
by
the
relatively
and
definite
provision
for
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--
in
pioneer's
mortgage.
sir
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
there
were
some
200
odd
dollars
of
normal
tax
cost,
court
fees
and
so
on.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
government
has
never
disputed
that
normal
tax
costs
which
are
definite
amount
which
are
paid
generally
speaking
to
court
officials
as
a
toll
for
using
the
court
have
precedence
over
everything.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
they
are
certainly
as
definite
as
things
can
be
in
the
--
in
life.
there's
a
$10
fee
for
that
and
a
$50
fee
for
that.
in
addition,
and
i
don't
mean
to
mislead
you,
there
are
expenses
of
the
sale.
the
sheriff
who
conducts
the
sale
gets
a
percentage
of
the
proceeds,
but
we're
talking
here
about
the
net
proceeds
of
the
sale
rather
than
the
gross
proceeds.
you
have
to
hire
a
hall
perhaps
to
accommodate
the
people
who
want
to
bid.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
there
is
--
there's
first
of
all
the
historical
difference
that
we
have
always
recognized
or
generally
recognized
in
the
united
states,
in
this
court,
throughout
the
states
that
there
is
a
difference
between
counsel
fees
as
cost
which
may
or
may
not
be
allowable,
generally
are
not,
and
the
fees
paid
into
court
to
clerks
and
so
on
for
services
provided
by
the
court.
and
that
distinction
is
not
foreign
to
the
new
jersey
courts.
only
shortly
before
this
case
was
decided,
the
supreme
court
wrote
in
united
states-pipe
&
foundry
--
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
wrote
in
united
states-pipe
&
foundry,
which
is
cited
on
page
14
of
our
brief
that
cost
generally
comprise
principally
certain
statutory
allowances,
amounts
paid
the
clerk
in
fees
and
various
other
specified
disbursements
of
counsel,
including
sheriff's
fees,
witness
fees,
deposition
expenses
and
printing
costs.
counsel
fees,
although
if
allowable,
are
included
in
the
tax
costs
are
an
entirely
different
matter.
so
this
isn't
a
noble
notion
to
the
--
even
to
the
new
jersey
courts.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i'm
sorry?
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
--
they
took
a
much
more
restrictive
view
of
the
circumstances
under
which
those
might
possibly
be
allowed.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
as
tax
costs.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right,
if
you
know
the
amount
of
the
judgment
to
be
allowed.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
you
can't
know
that
until
judgment.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
but
certainly
when
the
federal
lien
arose
you
didn't
know
what
it
was
going
to
pay
you.
there
is
also
the
fact
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
except
i
think
on
the
theory
which
in
a
way
the
court
adopted
in
pioneer
that
there
is
a
difference
between
something
reimbursement
for
an
amount
paid
into
court
or
state
court
officers
as
a
toll
for
judicial
process,
and
something
paid
to
your
adversary
for
his
lawyer
who
is
representing
him
in
an
adverse
relationship.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no,
i
think
not.
there
is
no
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
you
certainly
don't
know
at
any
time
the
dollar
figure,
but
the
crucial
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
when
the
federal
lien
arises,
you
don't
get
(voice

--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no,
but
the
point
is
that
the
counsel
fee
problem
is
contingent
and
inchoate
in
a
much
more
fundamental
sense.
you
know
that
principal
and
interest
are
going
to
be
returned
that
the
principal
is
going
to
be
--
is
to
be
returned.
the
liability
has
arisen.
with
respect
to
counsel
fees
the
liability
which
the
lien
is
designed
to
secure
has
not
occurred
until
default.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
with
respect
to
taxes
that
the
mortgagee
might
pay?
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
we've
certainly
taken
the
position
consistently
and
the
court
has
supported
us
in
that
view
that
if
the
mortgagee
pays
taxes
after
a
federal
lien
arises
and
those
taxes
themselves,
state
taxes,
would
be
junior
to
the
federal
lien
that
the
recompense
for
the
amounts
paid
out
are
not
senior
to
the
federal
lien.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
insurance
presents
a
more
difficult
question.
if
--
it
depends
upon
what
the
insurance
is
to
cover.
if
the
insurance
is
merely
to
cover
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
if
it's
--
but
the
question
is
how
much.
if
it's
merely
designed
to
secure
the
mortgagee's
interest
then
it's
of
no
value
or
interest
to
the
united
states
to
help
them
(voice

--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
any
subsequent
advances,
that's
right.
i
would
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i'm
not
sure
i
think
of
how
life
insurance
would
come
into
play,
but
i
--
but
the
general
rule
is
that
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
all
advances
made
subsequent
to
the
falling
in
the
--
or
of
the
attachment
of
the
federal
lien
have
to
be
subordinate
under
the
general
rule,
first
in
time
is
first
in
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
court
has
taken
the
view
in
a
long
series
of
cases
that
a
security
for
future
advances
does
not
give
priority
when
those
advances
occur
after
the
federal
lien
arises.
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
because
of
inchoateness,
because
--
well,
in
a
sense
there's
a
very
practical
problem
here.
we
live
in
a
society
that
the
local
expression
is
in
hot.
people
are
borrowing
credit
all
the
time.
if
you
didn't
in
some
way
say
these
types
of
security
arrangements
we're
going
to
recognize,
but
security
arrangements
for
everything
in
the
future
we're
not
going
to
recognize,
it's
simply
be
no
way
for
a
federal
lien
to
attach
to
anything
in
most
cases.
you
could
suppose
an
assignment,
indeed
it's
not
unheard
of,
as
--
of
all
future
wages
for
all
future
credit
to
be
extended
that
embraces
everything.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
specified
in
the
mortgage
or
in
the
lien
or
in
the
rules?
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
still
remains
the
fact
that
at
the
time
the
federal
lien
attached
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
at
all
that
foreclosure
would
take
place,
the
default
would
take
place.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
was
a
remote
contingency.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
but
until
default
--
until
the
equitable
has
to
go
into
court,
it
doesn't
incur
a
liability.
it
has
incurred
the
liability
for
the
principal
and
it's
entitled
to
the
price
of
its
money
which
is
interest.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it's
that
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
perhaps
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
certainly
true,
and
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
perhaps
there
is
an
inconsistency.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
perhaps
there
is
an
inconsistency.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
but
there
has
been
--
there
is
the
feeling
that
these
are
small,
they're
de
minimis.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
and
there's
an
element
of
comity
to
the
states.
it's
going
to
state
officers.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
you
don't.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
although
i'm
sure
is
that
the
problem
hasn't
arisen
and
therefore
we've
never
been
forced
to
an
election
or
its
determination
that
this
is
a
matter
of
grace
on
the
part
of
the
government
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--
or
rise
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
counsel
fee?
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
think
logically
we
--
under
the
decisions
up
to
date
and
what
little
one
can
get
out
of
the
statute,
we
should
be
entitled
to
say
no
costs
of
any
sort.
i
think
a
distinction
can
be
drawn
nonetheless
between
the
two
types
of
costs
which
perhaps
eases
the
inevitable
frictions
between
state
and
federal
governments
and
which
the
treasury
has
been
willing
to
draw,
and
which
i
hope
they
will
continue
to
draw
because
it
makes
life
much
simpler.
but
i
think
as
a
logical
matter,
we
should
be
able
to
insist
on
cost
in
their
entirety.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i'm
--
i
wish
should
be
entitled
to
priority
to
cost
--
over
cost
in
their
entirety.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
possible.
returning
briefly
to
the
supposed
precision
of
the
percentages
supplied
by
the
court
rules,
i
just
want
to
emphasize
that
there
are
many
circumstances
in
which
the
sums
adjudged
to
be
paid
can
be
varied
by
factors
other
than
the
accrue
interest
and
principal,
which
therefore
would
affect
the
sums
adjudged
to
be
paid
and
therefore
protect
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes
it
is.
its
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--
1%,
1.5%,
3%
over
some
amount,
but
there
are
--
they
are
taxes,
there
is
insurance,
there're
all
sorts
of
things
which
might
or
might
not
have
priority
over
the
federal
claim
which
nevertheless
expand
or
contract
the
attorney's
fees.
and
i
think
the
allu
--
the
impression
of
precision
is
really
a
little
illusory.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
government's
position
would
still
be
that
at
the
time
the
federal
lien
attached,
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
fee
was
contingent.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
than
the
costs,
the
court
costs,
that's
true.
now
there
is
an
important
distinction
which
--
between
pioneer
and
this
case
which
i
think
also
is
worthy
of
some
note
and
it
bears
on
this
problem
of
contingency,
because
after
all
in
pioneer
by
the
time
the
federal
lien
was
reported
defaults
had
occurred,
the
mortgagee
had
elected
to
declare
the
note
due
and
payable,
an
attorney
had
been
engaged
and
a
suit
to
foreclose
the
mortgage
had
been
filed.
there
was
no
doubt
in
pioneer
that
the
attorney's
fee
was
to
be
incurred.
the
--
some
uncertainty
as
to
the
amount,
it
hadn't
actually
been
incurred
but
there
was
really
no
contingency
that
it
would
be
con
--
incurred.
in
the
present
case,
all
of
those
events
were
in
the
unforeseeable,
unpredictable
future.
a
year
was
to
go
by
after
the
federal
lien
was
recorded
before
the
default
occurred
which
precipitated
the
foreclosure
which
led
ultimately
to
the
allowance
of
an
attorney's
fee.
if
pioneer's
lien
was
like
a
lien
to
secure
future
indebtedness
even
though
the
lawyer
whose
fee
was
involved
was
already
hard
at
work,
here,
the
degree
of
futurity,
the
element
of
contingency
is
much
more
marked.
the
fact
is
that
equitable's
lien,
if
there
was
a
lien
at
all,
was
entirely
contingent
because
the
events
which
would
lead
to
the
liability
which
the
lien
would
secure
had
not
occurred
and
might
never
have
occurred.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice,
i
just
like
to
make
one
or
two
very
short
points.
as
counsel
for
equitable
pointed
out,
the
question
of
fixed
in
amount
as
spelled
out
in
new
britain
has
not
been
spelled
out
in
great
detail.
but
one
thing
ought
to
be
very
clear,
if
you
can't
tell
whether
the
amount
is
something
or
another,
as
was
the
case
here,
it
certainly
not
fixed
in
amount.
in
this
case,
we're
not
talking
about
whether
it
was
$10
or
$12
or
$100.
at
the
time
the
federal
lien
attached
we
didn't
know
where
there
was
any
dollars
and
in
fact
it
might
well
and
in
the
normal
course
of
things
would've
been
nothing.
the
respondent
also
faces
great
reliance
on
the
1912
or
1913
act
of
congress,
which
it
says
cong
--
in
which
it
says
congress
impended
to
protect
a
wide
variety
of
interests
pertaining
to
the
mortgagee.
now
the
1912
act,
which
is
now
section
6323,
simply
provides
that
until
recorded
the
federal
tax
lien
should
be
invalid
as
against
mortgagees
as
well
as
against
a
variety
of
other
people.
and
it
seems
quite
clear
that
it
was
designed
simply
to
protect
against
the
secret
lien.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
committee
reports
deal
largely
with
the
problem
of
the
purchaser
who
doesn't
know
that
a
lien
is
attached
to
his
property.
but
there
is
reason
to
suppose
that
it
intended
to
protect
every
device
for
augmenting
a
mortgagee's
security
against
prospective
risks
whenever
they
might
ripen
into
liabilities
that
mortgagee's
lawyers
could
device.
indeed
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
pioneer,
congress
did
not
intend
to
purport
or
did
not
purport
to
affect
the
time
at
which
local
liens
were
deemed
to
arise
or
to
become
choate
or
to
subordinate
the
tax
lien
to
tentative,
conditional
or
imperfect
state
liens.
clearly
when
the
federal
lien
arose
here,
equitable's
lien
if
there
was
one
at
that
point
was
at
best
tentative
conditional
and
imperfect.
finally,
i'd
like
to
point
out
one
other
attribute
of
the
new
jersey
rule
and
of
similar
rules
in
a
few
other
states
that
provide
court
counsel
fees.
it
seems
to
me,
although
i
have
not
investigated
the
legislative
history
of
many
of
these
rules,
that
they
were
designed
principally
not
to
augment
the
mortgagee's
reach,
but
rather
to
restrict
it.
they
were
designed
to
prevent
overbearing.
they
were
designed
to
prevent
overreaching
and
they
did
it
by
saying,
as
new
jersey
says,
no
counsel
fee
shall
be
allowed
no
matter
what
the
mortgage
says
except
as
provided.
and
that's
--
the
theme
runs
through
the
several
states
that
have
such
arrangements.
they
were
not
designed
to
make
integral
to
the
mortgages
property
right
as
the
equitable
would
suggest.
some
new
claim
but
were
designed
to
restrict
overreaching
on
the
part
of
creditors.
i
don't
think
that
gives
a
right
that
the
congress
intended
to
protect
at
least
until
the
time
the
liability
arises.
thank
you.
