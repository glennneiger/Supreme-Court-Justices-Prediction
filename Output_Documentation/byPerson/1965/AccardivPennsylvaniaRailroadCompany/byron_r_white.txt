justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
posner
could
the
employer
in
--
have
said
i'm
going
to
give
this
separation
pay
based
only
to
those
people
who
have
worked
3/4
of
the
days
during
the
month?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
employer
would
just
disentitle
to
limit
separation
pay
to
those
who
had
worked,
actually
worked?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
disentitled
to
make
it
follow
the
length
of
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
the
government's
position,
as
i
understood
mr.
posner,
is
that
you
can
argue
this
case
even
though
there
was
a
specific
and
expressed
attempt
to
exclude
this
category
of
the
person.
the
government
says
that
the
employer
just
absolutely
disentitled
to
exclude
the
kind
of
person
that
it
involved
here,
one
that
was
off
in
service.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
tilton
controls
that
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
tilton
controls
that
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
tilton,
at
least,
the
petitioners
came
back
there
and
completed
the
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
came
back
to
have
completed
their
service
as
in
the
credit
and
then
their
seniority
was
dated
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
the
question
of
an
advancing
from
an
apprentice
to
a
permanent
position
and
you
had
to
do
those
for
a
certain
period
of
apprenticeship
before
you
became
permanent.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
when
they
came
back
to
service,
they
should
leave
the
apprenticeship.
justice
byron
r.
white
from
what
date
did
their
permanent
status
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
case
didn't
hold
that
if
they
hadn't
have
done
the
work,
they
were
entitled
to
a
permanent
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
agreement
based
vacation
or
the
severance
pay
on
the
length
of
seniority
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
would
--
anything
--
anything
that
is
computable
just
by
reference
to
the
passage
of
time
or
that's
automatic
in
the
passage
of
time
he
would've
got
credit
for
it,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
the
one
day
a
month
really
takes
it
out
to
that
category?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
if
could
--
do
think
the
parties
could
have
agreed
for
example
that
there
well
be
severance
pay
based
on
length
of
seniority
but
excluding
credit
for
a
military
veterans?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
duty
is
to
dispositive
of
the
case
doesn't
say
the
parties
agreed
on
it
or
that
it
was
in
the
heat
of
a
labor
conflict?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
just
asking
you
again
then
that
you
think
the
one
day
a
month
thing
is
so
significantly
different
from
just
basing
it
on
seniority
which
is
automatic
in
the
passage
of
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
it's
not
significantly
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
on
the
other
hand
do
you
concede
that
the
parties
that
the
employer
here
and
they
could
agree
now
to
make
earnings
the
basis
for
seniority
and
therefore
not
include
any
times
spent
in
the
military?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
you've
got
unfortunately
is
the
provision
in
the
contract,
were
going
to
make
the
separation
by
total
earnings.
